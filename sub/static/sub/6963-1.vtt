03:12.592 --> 03:14.928
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

03:15.178 --> 03:17.014
My name is Jack Torrance.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.809
His office is the first door
on the left.

03:20.059 --> 03:21.185
Thank you.

03:38.581 --> 03:39.373
Mr. Ullman?

03:39.665 --> 03:40.876
I'm Jack Torrance.

03:41.126 --> 03:43.086
Come on in, Jack.

03:44.130 --> 03:46.674
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

03:46.924 --> 03:48.469
This is my secretary, Susie.

03:48.844 --> 03:51.346
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?

03:51.597 --> 03:54.349
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 31/2 hours.

03:54.558 --> 03:56.519
That's very good time.

03:56.895 --> 03:58.438
Sit down a minute, Jack.

03:58.688 --> 04:00.440
Just make yourself at home.

04:00.690 --> 04:01.858
Like some coffee?

04:02.150 --> 04:04.612
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

04:04.863 --> 04:05.739
- Susie.
- Sure.

04:06.031 --> 04:07.698
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.450
Yes, I will.

04:20.254 --> 04:21.422
Mom?

04:22.215 --> 04:23.424
Yeah?

04:23.800 --> 04:27.429
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

04:28.097 --> 04:29.390
Sure I do.

04:29.641 --> 04:31.559
It'll be lots of fun.

04:33.478 --> 04:35.564
Yeah. I guess so.

04:35.773 --> 04:39.944
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

04:40.736 --> 04:44.282
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.121
Yeah, I guess so.

04:48.913 --> 04:49.872
What about Tony?

04:50.165 --> 04:52.417
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.462
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

04:55.838 --> 04:58.174
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

04:58.675 --> 05:00.593
I don't want to go there.

05:01.136 --> 05:03.138
How come you don't want to go?

05:03.388 --> 05:05.136
I just don't.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.936
Let's just wait and see.

05:08.209 --> 05:10.905
We're all going to have
a real good time.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.749
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

05:14.950 --> 05:16.383
How do you do, Bill?

05:16.585 --> 05:18.553
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

05:18.754 --> 05:20.688
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

05:20.889 --> 05:25.020
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

05:25.261 --> 05:28.230
I'd like you to take him around
soon as we're through.

05:28.432 --> 05:29.365
Fine.

05:30.002 --> 05:31.902
Jack is a schoolteacher.

05:32.170 --> 05:34.138
Formerly a schoolteacher.

05:34.339 --> 05:36.034
What line of work are you in now?

05:36.241 --> 05:37.834
I'm a writer.

05:38.077 --> 05:41.706
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

05:41.914 --> 05:43.882
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

05:44.818 --> 05:46.615
I'm looking for a change.

05:46.821 --> 05:50.416
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

05:50.625 --> 05:52.217
...I agree with them.

05:52.862 --> 05:54.659
Let's see, where were we?

05:54.864 --> 05:57.457
I was about to explain...

05:57.699 --> 06:01.864
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

06:02.071 --> 06:05.529
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.540
Do you mind if I ask
why you do that?

06:08.746 --> 06:12.204
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

06:12.417 --> 06:15.011
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

06:15.219 --> 06:17.780
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

06:18.424 --> 06:20.153
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

06:20.359 --> 06:22.725
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

06:22.928 --> 06:26.160
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

06:26.366 --> 06:28.300
...to keep it clear.

06:28.502 --> 06:30.868
When the place was built in 1907...

06:31.072 --> 06:33.633
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

06:33.842 --> 06:38.711
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

06:38.947 --> 06:41.473
It's certainly got
plenty of that.

06:41.684 --> 06:42.878
That's right.

06:43.159 --> 06:45.912
Did they give you
any idea in Denver...

06:46.162 --> 06:47.789
...about what the job entails?

06:48.041 --> 06:50.126
Only in a very general way.

06:52.337 --> 06:55.007
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.

06:55.257 --> 06:58.594
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

06:58.886 --> 07:00.804
...and depreciation
which can occur.

07:01.055 --> 07:03.475
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

07:03.725 --> 07:07.646
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

07:07.896 --> 07:10.525
...repairing damage as it occurs...

07:10.818 --> 07:13.612
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

07:14.696 --> 07:16.949
That sounds fine to me.

07:17.324 --> 07:20.245
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

07:20.453 --> 07:23.581
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

07:23.873 --> 07:26.460
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

07:27.628 --> 07:32.216
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

07:32.592 --> 07:35.721
I'm outlining a new
writing project.

07:36.097 --> 07:39.392
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

07:40.184 --> 07:41.937
That's very good, Jack.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.356
Because, for some people...

07:45.565 --> 07:47.316
...solitude...

07:47.567 --> 07:49.110
...and isolation...

07:50.029 --> 07:52.240
...can, of itself, become a problem.

07:53.074 --> 07:54.742
Not for me.

07:55.243 --> 07:58.414
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

08:00.249 --> 08:01.333
They'll love it.

08:01.625 --> 08:02.835
Great.

08:05.755 --> 08:08.925
Before I turn you over to Bill...

08:09.217 --> 08:12.596
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.308
Not to sound melodramatic...

08:14.558 --> 08:17.060
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

08:17.269 --> 08:19.479
...second thoughts about the job.

08:20.189 --> 08:21.816
I'm intrigued.

08:22.025 --> 08:24.360
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

08:24.569 --> 08:28.532
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

08:29.158 --> 08:31.118
I don't believe they did.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.414
My predecessor in this job...

08:36.208 --> 08:39.419
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

08:39.669 --> 08:43.090
He came up with his wife and
2 little girls of about 8 and 10.

08:43.341 --> 08:46.345
He had a good employment record,
good references.

08:46.595 --> 08:48.805
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

08:49.056 --> 08:51.683
...like a completely
normal individual.

08:51.977 --> 08:54.271
But at some point
during the winter...

08:54.522 --> 08:58.150
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.695
He ran amuck...

09:04.115 --> 09:06.284
...and killed his family
with an ax.

09:07.620 --> 09:12.208
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

09:13.043 --> 09:16.714
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

09:18.007 --> 09:19.759
The police thought...

09:20.009 --> 09:24.014
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

09:24.265 --> 09:27.268
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

09:27.518 --> 09:31.648
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

09:36.736 --> 09:38.071
That is...

09:38.321 --> 09:39.824
...quite a story.

09:41.158 --> 09:42.618
Yeah, it is.

09:43.703 --> 09:47.082
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

09:47.374 --> 09:49.042
But it did.

09:50.836 --> 09:54.841
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

09:55.426 --> 09:57.887
I certainly can.

09:58.387 --> 10:00.973
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

10:01.223 --> 10:03.435
...left it for you to tell me.

10:04.644 --> 10:07.314
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

10:07.564 --> 10:11.611
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

10:11.861 --> 10:16.699
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.580
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

10:20.830 --> 10:24.667
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

10:24.918 --> 10:27.671
She's a confirmed ghost story...

10:27.963 --> 10:30.299
...and horror film addict.

10:36.181 --> 10:39.893
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?

10:41.312 --> 10:43.523
He already did.

10:43.940 --> 10:47.652
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

11:02.378 --> 11:05.048
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, hon. How's it going?

11:05.298 --> 11:08.802
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to do.

11:09.094 --> 11:12.139
I don't think I can get home
before 9 or 10.

11:12.390 --> 11:13.849
Sounds like you got the job.

11:14.059 --> 11:16.770
Right. It's a beautiful place.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.106
You and Danny are going to love it.

11:20.608 --> 11:23.527
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

11:23.777 --> 11:25.487
I don't know.

11:26.530 --> 11:30.118
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

11:30.702 --> 11:32.787
I don't want to.

11:33.496 --> 11:34.747
Please.

11:35.917 --> 11:37.085
No.

11:37.377 --> 11:39.504
Now, Tony, tell me.

12:09.066 --> 12:11.796
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

12:16.275 --> 12:18.505
That's good. Now the other one.

12:19.912 --> 12:21.379
Good boy.

12:28.722 --> 12:30.088
Now, Danny...

12:30.558 --> 12:32.583
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

12:32.794 --> 12:35.786
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

12:35.998 --> 12:40.766
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

12:43.607 --> 12:44.767
No.

12:45.843 --> 12:48.334
Do you remember when you were
brushing your teeth?

12:48.913 --> 12:50.210
Yes.

12:51.349 --> 12:54.979
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

12:59.192 --> 13:01.821
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

13:06.033 --> 13:08.263
Can you remember
what you were doing...

13:08.469 --> 13:11.405
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

13:13.908 --> 13:15.671
Talking to Tony.

13:16.343 --> 13:18.710
Is Tony one of your animals?

13:19.582 --> 13:22.517
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

13:22.818 --> 13:25.219
Tony's his imaginary friend.

13:28.158 --> 13:31.559
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

13:34.232 --> 13:35.460
Why not?

13:36.734 --> 13:38.565
Because he hides.

13:39.305 --> 13:40.967
Where does he go?

13:42.075 --> 13:43.872
To my stomach.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.814
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

13:52.887 --> 13:55.549
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

13:58.194 --> 13:59.627
That's fine.

14:00.396 --> 14:02.193
All right, Danny.

14:02.999 --> 14:05.798
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

14:06.003 --> 14:09.370
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

14:09.573 --> 14:10.699
Do I have to?

14:10.908 --> 14:13.173
Yes. I'd like you to.

14:13.378 --> 14:16.142
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

14:16.348 --> 14:18.475
I'll come back and check on you.

14:26.995 --> 14:29.395
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.

14:33.101 --> 14:34.967
- Please.
- Thank you.

14:38.842 --> 14:43.212
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

14:43.414 --> 14:47.441
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

14:52.190 --> 14:55.318
He seems absolutely fine now.

14:55.527 --> 14:56.516
But you should've seen him.

14:57.195 --> 14:58.220
I know.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.126
Kids can scare you to death.

15:00.334 --> 15:03.200
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.964
And they look much worse
than they are.

15:06.507 --> 15:09.169
But what was the matter with him?

15:09.376 --> 15:13.472
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

15:13.682 --> 15:18.551
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

15:19.354 --> 15:22.324
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

15:22.526 --> 15:25.495
...a kind of self-induced trance.

15:25.696 --> 15:27.687
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

15:28.565 --> 15:31.660
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

15:34.272 --> 15:36.536
I'm sure you're right.

15:38.177 --> 15:40.873
Have you been in Boulder long?

15:41.681 --> 15:42.978
Only about three months.

15:43.183 --> 15:46.551
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

15:48.556 --> 15:52.356
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend...

15:52.794 --> 15:53.624
Tony.

15:53.829 --> 15:57.788
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

16:00.904 --> 16:02.235
Let's see...

16:02.940 --> 16:05.500
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

16:05.709 --> 16:08.406
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

16:08.813 --> 16:11.111
Did he adjust well to school?

16:13.318 --> 16:15.252
He didn't like it too much
at first.

16:15.453 --> 16:18.753
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and...

16:20.159 --> 16:24.062
I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

16:25.066 --> 16:27.466
What sort of injury did he have?

16:28.136 --> 16:30.297
He dislocated his shoulder.

16:30.772 --> 16:33.037
How did he manage to do that?

16:36.478 --> 16:39.539
It was just one of
those things, you know.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.740
Purely an accident.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.518
My husband had been drinking...

16:45.723 --> 16:49.057
...and he came home
about three hours late.

16:49.361 --> 16:53.922
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

16:54.665 --> 16:59.433
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

16:59.638 --> 17:03.939
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

17:04.144 --> 17:07.204
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

17:07.414 --> 17:09.439
...you know, in a park
or in the street.

17:10.550 --> 17:13.180
But on this particular occasion...

17:13.387 --> 17:16.016
...my husband just used
too much strength...

17:16.223 --> 17:18.819
...and he injured Danny's arm.

17:21.864 --> 17:26.393
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said...

17:26.637 --> 17:29.197
..."Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

17:29.407 --> 17:31.341
And if I do, you can leave me."

17:31.542 --> 17:32.873
And he didn't.

17:33.077 --> 17:37.572
He hasn't had any
alcohol in 5 months.

18:04.626 --> 18:08.798
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

18:14.430 --> 18:15.639
Dad?

18:18.475 --> 18:20.185
I'm hungry.

18:21.980 --> 18:24.733
You should've eaten your breakfast.

18:25.568 --> 18:28.446
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

18:28.697 --> 18:30.324
Okay, Mom.

18:31.783 --> 18:35.912
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

18:37.624 --> 18:41.168
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

18:42.586 --> 18:45.048
What was the Donner party?

18:46.925 --> 18:51.221
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

18:51.472 --> 18:54.684
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

18:54.893 --> 18:59.147
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

19:00.232 --> 19:03.152
You mean they ate each other up?

19:03.361 --> 19:06.447
They had to, in order to survive.

19:06.698 --> 19:07.909
Jack.

19:08.159 --> 19:09.202
Don't worry, Mom.

19:09.452 --> 19:13.665
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

19:13.915 --> 19:16.585
See, it's okay.

19:16.794 --> 19:19.213
He saw it on the television.

19:49.958 --> 19:51.751
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8:30.

19:52.002 --> 19:54.714
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

19:54.964 --> 19:56.882
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.

19:57.133 --> 20:00.219
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

20:00.469 --> 20:03.056
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

20:03.307 --> 20:06.143
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

20:06.394 --> 20:08.062
Is your family
having a look around?

20:08.313 --> 20:11.650
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.945
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.

20:15.529 --> 20:17.448
In view of all we have
to cover today...

20:17.699 --> 20:21.328
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

20:21.578 --> 20:24.331
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

20:24.581 --> 20:27.293
I'd better collect my family first.

20:35.385 --> 20:37.763
This is our Colorado Lounge.

20:38.013 --> 20:40.390
It's beautiful.

20:40.849 --> 20:42.644
My God!

20:42.894 --> 20:45.396
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?

20:45.647 --> 20:46.981
It sure is.

20:47.003 --> 20:49.802
I've never seen anything
like this before.

20:51.443 --> 20:53.411
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

20:53.611 --> 20:55.044
I believe they're based...

20:55.246 --> 20:58.444
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

20:58.651 --> 21:00.619
They're really gorgeous.

21:00.820 --> 21:01.844
As a matter of fact...

21:02.054 --> 21:05.149
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

21:05.559 --> 21:08.528
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

21:08.729 --> 21:11.823
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

21:12.033 --> 21:15.003
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

21:15.204 --> 21:18.264
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

21:18.540 --> 21:19.802
Lots of movie stars.

21:20.008 --> 21:21.567
Royalty?

21:21.945 --> 21:23.344
All the best people.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.720
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.

22:20.679 --> 22:24.017
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

22:24.267 --> 22:27.145
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.

22:27.395 --> 22:29.314
And here are your quarters.

22:29.815 --> 22:32.360
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

22:32.610 --> 22:35.155
And a small bedroom for your son.

22:38.701 --> 22:40.745
Perfect for a child.

22:47.277 --> 22:50.735
Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

22:50.949 --> 22:52.507
Easy to keep.

22:55.287 --> 22:56.345
Cozy.

22:56.555 --> 22:58.819
Yes, very cozy for a family.

22:59.058 --> 23:00.719
If you feel like spreading out...

23:00.926 --> 23:03.589
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

23:05.232 --> 23:07.723
Well, it's very...

23:08.268 --> 23:09.566
...homey.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.738
This is our famous hedge maze.

23:14.943 --> 23:19.244
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

23:19.449 --> 23:21.747
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

23:21.951 --> 23:24.579
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

23:24.788 --> 23:27.780
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

23:29.193 --> 23:31.286
When was the Overlook built?

23:32.297 --> 23:34.528
Construction started in 1907.

23:34.734 --> 23:36.702
It was finished in 1909.

23:36.902 --> 23:39.564
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

23:39.772 --> 23:41.400
They actually had to repel...

23:41.608 --> 23:44.509
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

23:45.112 --> 23:47.012
That's our Snowcat.

23:47.714 --> 23:49.740
Can you both drive a car?

23:50.285 --> 23:53.846
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

23:54.056 --> 23:56.617
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

23:57.827 --> 24:01.194
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

24:01.398 --> 24:04.527
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.702
He sure did a beautiful job.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.235
Pink and gold
are my favorite colors.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.407
This is our Gold Ballroom.

24:13.979 --> 24:15.241
I'll say!

24:15.447 --> 24:19.213
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

24:19.752 --> 24:22.619
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

24:22.822 --> 24:26.622
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

24:26.826 --> 24:29.887
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

24:30.097 --> 24:33.157
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

24:33.368 --> 24:34.335
We don't drink.

24:34.536 --> 24:35.970
Then you're in luck.

24:36.172 --> 24:40.404
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.737
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

24:42.946 --> 24:45.676
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

24:45.882 --> 24:47.076
Glad to meet you.

24:47.284 --> 24:50.151
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

24:50.354 --> 24:54.086
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

24:54.293 --> 24:56.158
It's just wonderful.

24:56.362 --> 24:57.886
Hi, Danny!

24:58.798 --> 25:01.494
I found him outside
looking for you.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.569
Did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

25:06.974 --> 25:08.464
Come on over here.

25:08.676 --> 25:09.836
Thank you, Susie.

25:10.044 --> 25:14.038
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

25:14.250 --> 25:16.115
...while I continue on with Jack.

25:16.319 --> 25:18.753
It would be a pleasure.
Right this way.

25:18.955 --> 25:20.513
Great. See you later, hon.

25:20.723 --> 25:22.089
Bye, darling.

25:24.461 --> 25:27.794
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

25:27.998 --> 25:30.524
Now, are you a "Winnie",
or a "Freddie"?

25:30.735 --> 25:31.997
I'm a Wendy.

25:32.203 --> 25:35.400
Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

25:35.608 --> 25:37.235
This is the kitchen, huh?

25:37.444 --> 25:39.036
This is it.

25:39.246 --> 25:42.181
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

25:43.016 --> 25:45.212
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

25:45.453 --> 25:47.785
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

25:47.989 --> 25:51.550
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

25:52.460 --> 25:54.326
Don't let it get you down.

25:54.531 --> 25:57.021
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

25:57.232 --> 25:59.427
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

25:59.635 --> 26:01.866
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

26:02.071 --> 26:05.199
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

26:05.408 --> 26:10.073
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

26:10.281 --> 26:13.375
Right here is
our walk-in freezer.

26:14.518 --> 26:17.579
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

26:17.790 --> 26:19.781
You got 15 rib roasts...

26:19.992 --> 26:22.119
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

26:22.328 --> 26:25.389
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

26:25.599 --> 26:28.693
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

26:28.902 --> 26:31.872
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

26:33.107 --> 26:35.473
You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?

26:35.678 --> 26:37.543
French fries and ketchup.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.272
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

26:40.484 --> 26:42.213
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.518
How'd you know we call him Doc?

26:50.728 --> 26:54.755
- Beg your pardon?
- Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

26:54.966 --> 26:56.366
I did?

26:57.170 --> 27:00.298
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

27:00.507 --> 27:01.769
But how did you know?

27:01.975 --> 27:04.501
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

27:04.712 --> 27:06.976
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

27:07.181 --> 27:09.376
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

27:09.583 --> 27:11.779
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

27:13.221 --> 27:14.654
What's up, Doc?

27:16.492 --> 27:18.688
Now, this is the storeroom.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.261
In here is where we keep...

27:22.466 --> 27:25.264
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.904
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

27:28.106 --> 27:31.906
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

27:32.110 --> 27:35.308
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

27:35.514 --> 27:39.541
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

27:39.786 --> 27:42.221
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

27:42.423 --> 27:45.619
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

27:53.267 --> 27:55.735
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

27:58.141 --> 28:00.132
Sociables, finger rolls...

28:00.343 --> 28:01.867
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

28:02.078 --> 28:05.606
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

28:05.816 --> 28:08.910
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

28:09.119 --> 28:13.420
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

28:16.328 --> 28:17.955
- How're you getting on?
- Fine.

28:18.164 --> 28:21.726
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

28:21.935 --> 28:23.869
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

28:24.071 --> 28:27.268
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

28:27.474 --> 28:29.340
You like ice cream, Doc?

28:30.211 --> 28:31.178
I thought you did.

28:31.379 --> 28:34.439
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

28:34.649 --> 28:36.480
- Not at all.
- We don't mind.

28:36.685 --> 28:38.880
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?

28:39.089 --> 28:41.148
Okay, you behave yourself.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.026
What kind of ice cream
do you like?

28:46.230 --> 28:47.128
Chocolate.

28:47.331 --> 28:50.300
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

28:54.873 --> 28:56.864
It's amazing, all this
activity today.

28:57.075 --> 28:59.873
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

29:00.080 --> 29:01.513
...last day's always hectic.

29:01.715 --> 29:04.775
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

29:04.985 --> 29:09.013
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

29:09.224 --> 29:11.283
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

29:16.966 --> 29:19.935
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

29:26.511 --> 29:28.911
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

29:35.887 --> 29:39.380
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

29:39.793 --> 29:42.318
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

29:42.529 --> 29:46.363
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

29:47.435 --> 29:49.733
She called it "shining."

29:51.238 --> 29:53.968
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

29:54.175 --> 29:56.804
...that had "the shine" to us.

29:57.412 --> 30:00.404
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

30:01.084 --> 30:02.950
But there are other folks...

30:03.153 --> 30:06.884
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

30:11.563 --> 30:13.997
How long have you
been able to do it?

30:19.205 --> 30:21.605
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

30:26.848 --> 30:28.907
I'm not supposed to.

30:30.485 --> 30:33.010
Who says you ain't supposed to?

30:36.458 --> 30:37.857
Tony.

30:39.828 --> 30:41.490
Who's Tony?

30:43.968 --> 30:47.369
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

30:49.307 --> 30:51.332
Is Tony the one
that...

30:51.543 --> 30:53.101
...tells you things?

30:57.650 --> 31:00.016
How does he tell you things?

31:01.855 --> 31:06.156
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

31:06.361 --> 31:10.457
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

31:12.300 --> 31:15.998
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

31:19.308 --> 31:21.869
Do they know he tells you things?

31:22.746 --> 31:25.681
Tony told me never to tell them.

31:27.818 --> 31:31.186
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

31:31.389 --> 31:33.949
About the Overlook Hotel?

31:37.229 --> 31:38.787
I don't know.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.496
Now think real hard, Doc.

31:42.702 --> 31:43.727
Think.

31:46.841 --> 31:49.571
Maybe he showed me something.

31:50.511 --> 31:53.140
Try to think of what it was.

31:56.151 --> 31:59.451
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

32:02.558 --> 32:04.788
Scared of nothing here.

32:05.262 --> 32:06.752
It's just that...

32:07.498 --> 32:10.331
...you know, some places
are like people.

32:11.169 --> 32:12.864
Some shine...

32:13.071 --> 32:14.470
...and some don't.

32:15.708 --> 32:17.835
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

32:18.043 --> 32:21.342
...has something about it
that's like shining.

32:24.385 --> 32:26.785
Is there something bad here?

32:38.401 --> 32:40.835
You know, Doc,
when something happens...

32:41.037 --> 32:44.666
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

32:45.442 --> 32:47.001
Say, like...

32:47.212 --> 32:50.272
...if someone burns toast.

32:52.384 --> 32:57.049
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

32:58.224 --> 33:01.661
Not things that anyone
can notice.

33:01.862 --> 33:06.663
But things that people
who shine can see.

33:07.769 --> 33:11.069
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

33:13.341 --> 33:17.506
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

33:19.048 --> 33:21.915
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

33:22.117 --> 33:25.815
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

33:26.357 --> 33:28.757
And not all of them
was good.

33:32.063 --> 33:34.692
What about room 237?

33:38.036 --> 33:40.231
Room 237?

33:41.541 --> 33:44.635
You're scared of room 237,
ain't you?

33:46.413 --> 33:47.880
No, I ain't.

33:49.384 --> 33:53.218
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

33:54.556 --> 33:55.921
Nothing.

33:56.359 --> 33:59.590
There ain't nothing in room 237.

33:59.795 --> 34:03.026
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

34:03.232 --> 34:05.360
So stay out.

34:05.569 --> 34:08.060
You understand? Stay out!

35:47.454 --> 35:49.183
Good morning, hon.

35:51.192 --> 35:52.955
Your breakfast is ready.

35:53.729 --> 35:55.356
What time is it?

35:55.564 --> 35:57.429
It's about 11:30.

35:59.335 --> 36:00.928
Jesus.

36:01.872 --> 36:04.306
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

36:04.608 --> 36:06.041
I know it.

36:07.344 --> 36:10.212
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.074
Nice.

36:14.353 --> 36:16.150
It's really pretty outside.

36:16.355 --> 36:19.587
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

36:20.193 --> 36:24.528
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

36:25.966 --> 36:27.627
Any ideas yet?

36:28.636 --> 36:30.297
Lots of ideas.

36:30.505 --> 36:32.029
No good ones.

36:32.508 --> 36:34.976
Something will come.

36:35.478 --> 36:39.414
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

36:40.984 --> 36:42.679
That's all it is.

36:44.788 --> 36:47.086
It's really nice up here,
isn't it?

36:47.491 --> 36:48.925
I love it.

36:49.427 --> 36:51.018
I really do.

36:51.930 --> 36:54.956
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

36:55.166 --> 36:58.933
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

36:59.138 --> 37:02.039
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

37:02.241 --> 37:04.301
...I thought it was kind of scary.

37:04.744 --> 37:07.304
I fell in love with it right away.

37:07.981 --> 37:10.779
When I came up here
for my interview...

37:11.153 --> 37:14.987
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

37:15.190 --> 37:17.818
I mean, we all have moments
of deja vu...

37:18.026 --> 37:20.222
...but this was ridiculous.

37:20.964 --> 37:22.829
It was almost as though I knew...

37:23.032 --> 37:26.764
...what was going to be
around every corner.

37:59.909 --> 38:03.106
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

38:03.313 --> 38:05.874
- All right.
- And you're going to lose.

38:06.083 --> 38:09.211
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

38:14.227 --> 38:15.353
Look out!

38:15.561 --> 38:17.426
I'm coming in close.

38:17.630 --> 38:20.121
Loser has to keep America clean.

38:20.366 --> 38:21.994
Keep America clean.

38:23.003 --> 38:24.470
Danny, you win.

38:24.805 --> 38:27.137
Let's take the rest
of this walking.

38:29.678 --> 38:31.077
Give me your hand.

38:33.716 --> 38:35.513
Isn't it beautiful?

38:53.272 --> 38:54.637
Dead end.

39:52.106 --> 39:53.733
We made it.

39:54.243 --> 39:55.472
Isn't it beautiful?

40:17.170 --> 40:19.002
It's so pretty.

40:23.577 --> 40:26.547
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

40:37.827 --> 40:40.227
Rutherford was serving
a life sentence...

40:40.429 --> 40:42.193
...for a 1968 shooting.

40:42.399 --> 40:46.267
And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.

40:46.470 --> 40:49.838
24-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.

40:50.041 --> 40:52.771
She disappeared on a hunting
trip with her husband.

40:52.977 --> 40:55.775
They may have to
call off the search...

40:55.981 --> 40:58.507
...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.

40:58.718 --> 41:00.583
It's so beautiful
in Denver today...

41:00.787 --> 41:02.914
...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.

41:03.122 --> 41:05.353
I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...

41:05.559 --> 41:09.689
...yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.

41:09.897 --> 41:11.091
And it's moving...

41:11.298 --> 41:14.462
...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.

43:43.110 --> 43:44.543
Hi, hon.

43:48.149 --> 43:49.549
How's it going?

43:52.120 --> 43:53.280
Fine.

43:55.390 --> 43:56.949
Get a lot written today?

44:04.001 --> 44:06.561
The weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

44:11.775 --> 44:14.108
What do you want me
to do about it?

44:16.247 --> 44:18.408
Come on, hon.

44:18.750 --> 44:20.776
Don't be so grouchy.

44:21.188 --> 44:22.519
I'm not...

44:22.889 --> 44:24.083
...being grouchy.

44:24.291 --> 44:27.089
I just want to finish my work.

44:30.598 --> 44:32.998
Okay. I understand.

44:33.234 --> 44:35.829
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

44:36.038 --> 44:38.506
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

44:41.711 --> 44:42.803
Wendy...

44:43.012 --> 44:45.607
...let me explain something to you.

44:46.517 --> 44:50.385
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

44:50.588 --> 44:52.022
You're distracting me...

44:52.224 --> 44:55.660
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

44:55.861 --> 44:57.294
Understand?

45:00.767 --> 45:01.927
Fine.

45:03.103 --> 45:04.832
We're going to make a new rule:

45:05.038 --> 45:06.471
Whenever I'm in here...

45:06.674 --> 45:08.938
...and you hear me typing...

45:10.745 --> 45:13.680
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

45:13.882 --> 45:16.181
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

45:16.385 --> 45:18.615
That means don't come in.

45:18.821 --> 45:21.085
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

45:25.730 --> 45:26.856
Fine.

45:27.899 --> 45:31.199
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

46:07.144 --> 46:08.509
All right, you!

46:09.948 --> 46:11.745
I know you've got more.

46:13.852 --> 46:14.910
Missed!

46:20.492 --> 46:21.322
Don't have!

46:21.560 --> 46:23.289
No fair anymore.

47:31.976 --> 47:33.273
I knew it.

48:03.545 --> 48:07.038
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

48:09.553 --> 48:13.250
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

48:13.457 --> 48:16.586
This is KDK 1.
We're receiving you. Over.

48:16.961 --> 48:20.089
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

48:20.665 --> 48:23.464
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

48:23.736 --> 48:25.067
We're just fine.

48:25.270 --> 48:27.738
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

48:27.941 --> 48:30.968
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

48:31.612 --> 48:35.412
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

48:35.716 --> 48:38.914
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

48:39.121 --> 48:40.281
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

48:40.489 --> 48:43.925
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

48:44.426 --> 48:47.828
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

48:48.298 --> 48:51.199
Yes. It's one of the worst we've
had for years.

48:51.769 --> 48:54.967
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

48:55.440 --> 48:57.601
I suppose not. Over.

48:58.209 --> 49:01.509
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

49:01.714 --> 49:03.011
And, Mrs. Torrance?

49:03.215 --> 49:07.413
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

49:08.256 --> 49:09.746
Okay. We'll do that.

49:09.957 --> 49:12.016
It was real nice talking to you.

49:12.226 --> 49:14.854
Bye. Over and out.

49:49.770 --> 49:51.965
Hello, Danny.

49:57.245 --> 49:59.679
Come and play with us.

50:04.553 --> 50:07.317
Come and play with us, Danny.

50:09.159 --> 50:11.025
Forever...

50:12.797 --> 50:14.560
...and ever...

50:15.500 --> 50:17.525
...and ever.

50:49.005 --> 50:50.633
Tony...

50:51.643 --> 50:53.668
...I'm scared.

50:59.151 --> 51:02.712
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

51:04.323 --> 51:08.226
It's just like
pictures in a book, Danny.

51:08.428 --> 51:10.589
It isn't real.

51:21.260 --> 51:23.090
Please let me give you
some money.

51:23.294 --> 51:25.319
I wouldn't think of it.

51:25.563 --> 51:26.825
Well, how can I repay you?

51:27.799 --> 51:29.700
It's okay. Really.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.430
Well, I'm going to have
some coffee.

51:32.639 --> 51:34.163
Would you like some?

51:35.909 --> 51:36.968
Sure.

51:37.178 --> 51:39.043
Great. Sit down.

51:48.957 --> 51:51.585
Marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

51:53.230 --> 51:55.664
Coffee will be ready
in a few minutes.

51:59.436 --> 52:02.770
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

52:04.209 --> 52:06.939
Not right now.
Daddy's asleep.

52:07.914 --> 52:10.075
I won't make any noise.

52:11.485 --> 52:13.385
Now come on, Doc.

52:13.587 --> 52:15.282
He only went to bed
a few hours ago.

52:15.490 --> 52:17.287
Can't you wait till later?

52:17.492 --> 52:20.620
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

52:23.832 --> 52:25.129
All right.

52:25.334 --> 52:27.734
But really don't make a sound.

52:27.937 --> 52:29.427
I won't, Mom.

52:30.239 --> 52:31.969
Make sure you
come right back...

52:32.176 --> 52:34.167
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

52:36.314 --> 52:37.804
Okay, Mom.

53:27.072 --> 53:30.235
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

53:33.981 --> 53:36.176
Come here for a minute first.

54:13.193 --> 54:14.990
How's it going, Doc?

54:19.567 --> 54:21.365
Having a good time?

54:23.439 --> 54:24.906
Yes, Dad.

54:27.810 --> 54:29.039
Good.

54:31.247 --> 54:33.408
I want you to
have a good time.

54:34.117 --> 54:35.745
I am, Dad.

54:46.199 --> 54:47.996
Do you feel bad?

54:53.941 --> 54:56.239
I'm just a little bit tired.

54:57.812 --> 55:00.372
Then why don't you
go to sleep?

55:03.952 --> 55:05.510
I can't.

55:06.989 --> 55:09.287
I got too much to do.

55:18.603 --> 55:20.867
Do you like this hotel?

55:26.879 --> 55:28.278
I do.

55:29.248 --> 55:30.580
I love it.

55:32.786 --> 55:34.117
Don't you?

55:36.490 --> 55:37.980
I guess so.

55:40.629 --> 55:41.823
Good.

55:45.033 --> 55:47.366
I want you to like it here.

55:51.340 --> 55:54.742
I wish we could stay here
forever...

55:54.945 --> 55:56.742
...and ever...

55:57.415 --> 55:58.746
...and ever.

56:04.190 --> 56:05.214
What?

56:06.492 --> 56:09.587
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

56:15.068 --> 56:16.558
What do you mean?

56:21.677 --> 56:24.271
Did your mother ever
say that to you?

56:24.948 --> 56:26.745
That I would hurt you?

56:27.517 --> 56:28.882
No, Dad.

56:31.054 --> 56:32.613
You sure?

56:33.157 --> 56:34.715
Yes, Dad.

56:39.531 --> 56:41.557
I love you, Danny.

56:42.768 --> 56:45.362
I love you
more than anything else...

56:45.571 --> 56:48.131
...in the whole world...

56:48.909 --> 56:51.968
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

56:52.278 --> 56:53.506
...never.

56:54.380 --> 56:56.440
You know that, don't you?

56:56.917 --> 56:58.475
Yes, Dad.

56:59.420 --> 57:00.512
Good.

58:28.458 --> 58:30.222
Mom, are you in there?

59:49.486 --> 59:50.544
What happened?

59:50.754 --> 59:51.982
Honey...

59:52.856 --> 59:54.255
...what's wrong?

01:00:02.434 --> 01:00:03.834
I had the most...

01:00:04.037 --> 01:00:06.631
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

01:00:08.575 --> 01:00:11.511
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It's okay, it's okay now.

01:00:12.713 --> 01:00:14.078
Really.

01:00:18.352 --> 01:00:19.945
I dreamed that I...

01:00:20.155 --> 01:00:22.589
...that I killed
you and Danny.

01:00:25.328 --> 01:00:27.558
But I didn't just kill you.

01:00:28.865 --> 01:00:31.629
I cut you up
into little pieces.

01:00:34.304 --> 01:00:35.828
My God.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.100
I must be losing my mind.

01:00:41.378 --> 01:00:44.007
Everything's going to be
all right.

01:00:46.118 --> 01:00:48.814
Come on. Let's get up
off the floor.

01:00:56.663 --> 01:00:58.962
There. Now sit up.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.897
It's okay.

01:01:02.003 --> 01:01:03.436
It's okay.

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:08.704
Danny!

01:01:09.012 --> 01:01:10.946
Everything's okay!

01:01:11.147 --> 01:01:14.311
Just go play in your room
for a while.

01:01:14.652 --> 01:01:16.711
Your dad's just got
a headache.

01:01:18.022 --> 01:01:21.049
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

01:01:23.028 --> 01:01:25.963
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

01:01:26.165 --> 01:01:27.689
I'll be right back.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:31.662
Why don't you mind me?

01:01:38.279 --> 01:01:40.110
Oh, my God.

01:01:41.316 --> 01:01:43.716
What happened to your neck?

01:01:45.655 --> 01:01:47.782
What happened to your neck?

01:02:16.757 --> 01:02:18.725
You did this to him...

01:02:19.159 --> 01:02:20.592
...didn't you?!

01:02:22.429 --> 01:02:24.489
You son of a bitch!

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:26.564
You did this to him!

01:02:26.769 --> 01:02:28.202
Didn't you?!

01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:31.200
How could you?!

01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:33.170
How could you?!

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:06.142
God! I'd give anything
for a drink.

01:04:08.788 --> 01:04:11.689
I'd give my goddamn soul...

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:14.383
...for just a glass of beer.

01:04:29.379 --> 01:04:30.869
Hi, Lloyd.

01:04:34.418 --> 01:04:36.819
A little slow tonight,
isn't it?

01:04:41.692 --> 01:04:43.957
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

01:04:46.031 --> 01:04:47.498
What will it be?

01:04:49.169 --> 01:04:52.139
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

01:04:52.339 --> 01:04:55.672
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

01:04:55.876 --> 01:04:58.777
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

01:04:58.979 --> 01:05:02.245
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

01:05:02.951 --> 01:05:04.782
So here's what:

01:05:05.087 --> 01:05:07.386
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:10.388
...a little glass and some ice.

01:05:10.594 --> 01:05:12.619
You can do that,
can't you, Lloyd?

01:05:13.063 --> 01:05:15.430
You're not too busy, are you?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.491
No, sir.
I'm not busy at all.

01:05:19.003 --> 01:05:20.561
Good man.

01:05:20.872 --> 01:05:21.964
You set them up...

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.108
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

01:05:26.245 --> 01:05:29.180
White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

01:05:29.381 --> 01:05:31.543
White man's burden.

01:05:37.625 --> 01:05:38.752
Say, Lloyd...

01:05:38.961 --> 01:05:41.725
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

01:05:42.064 --> 01:05:44.498
How's my credit
in this joint, anyway?

01:05:44.766 --> 01:05:47.133
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

01:05:47.837 --> 01:05:49.464
That's swell.

01:05:49.672 --> 01:05:51.367
I like you, Lloyd.

01:05:51.575 --> 01:05:53.236
I always liked you.

01:05:53.444 --> 01:05:55.776
You were always the best of them.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.346
Best goddamned bartender...

01:05:58.549 --> 01:06:01.484
...from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine.

01:06:01.686 --> 01:06:03.916
Or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

01:06:04.189 --> 01:06:05.986
Thank you for saying so.

01:06:08.293 --> 01:06:12.822
Here's to 5 miserable months
on the wagon...

01:06:13.033 --> 01:06:17.094
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

01:06:35.326 --> 01:06:37.794
How are things going,
Mr. Torrance?

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:41.725
Things could be better.

01:06:43.235 --> 01:06:45.999
Things could be
a whole lot better.

01:06:46.872 --> 01:06:49.205
I hope it's nothing serious.

01:06:52.213 --> 01:06:54.204
Nothing serious.

01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:58.410
Just a little problem with...

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.748
...the old sperm bank
upstairs.

01:07:01.957 --> 01:07:04.324
Nothing I can't handle,
though.

01:07:04.527 --> 01:07:06.222
Thanks.

01:07:06.696 --> 01:07:07.685
Women.

01:07:07.897 --> 01:07:09.421
Can't live with them...

01:07:09.632 --> 01:07:11.463
...can't live without them.

01:07:14.672 --> 01:07:16.230
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

01:07:16.441 --> 01:07:17.908
Words of...

01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:19.634
...wisdom.

01:07:31.157 --> 01:07:34.388
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

01:07:34.595 --> 01:07:36.223
I didn't.

01:07:38.267 --> 01:07:42.863
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

01:07:43.472 --> 01:07:46.600
I love the little
son of a bitch.

01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:51.044
I'd do anything for him.

01:07:51.247 --> 01:07:54.045
Any fucking thing for him.

01:07:58.122 --> 01:08:00.683
But that bitch!

01:08:01.693 --> 01:08:03.388
As long as I live...

01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:07.064
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

01:08:16.678 --> 01:08:19.511
I did hurt him once, okay?

01:08:19.881 --> 01:08:21.941
It was an accident.

01:08:22.251 --> 01:08:24.845
Completely unintentional.

01:08:26.121 --> 01:08:28.350
It could have happened
to anybody.

01:08:30.093 --> 01:08:33.551
And it was three goddamn
years ago!

01:08:33.763 --> 01:08:36.595
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:39.270
All I tried to do was pull him up.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.740
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

01:08:47.046 --> 01:08:48.274
I mean...

01:08:48.814 --> 01:08:52.341
...a few extra foot-pounds
of energy...

01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:55.386
...per second, per second.

01:09:11.508 --> 01:09:13.408
Thank God you're here.

01:09:16.648 --> 01:09:18.843
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

01:09:19.051 --> 01:09:21.576
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

01:09:21.787 --> 01:09:24.348
She tried to strangle Danny.

01:09:26.893 --> 01:09:29.292
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:09:31.231 --> 01:09:33.256
It's the truth! Really.

01:09:33.466 --> 01:09:35.457
I swear it.
Danny told me.

01:09:35.803 --> 01:09:37.667
He went up into
one of the bedrooms.

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:41.331
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:43.875
She tried to strangle him!

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:49.345
Which room was it?

01:09:56.995 --> 01:09:59.122
From Channel 10 in Miami...

01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:01.696
...this is Newswatch
with Glen Rinker...

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:06.099
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

01:10:06.439 --> 01:10:08.873
Good evening. I'm Glen Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.

01:10:09.074 --> 01:10:12.203
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...

01:10:12.412 --> 01:10:14.539
...bringing temperatures
to the 90s...

01:10:14.748 --> 01:10:17.876
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

01:10:18.085 --> 01:10:22.079
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell injust a few hours tonight.

01:10:22.291 --> 01:10:24.521
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

01:10:24.726 --> 01:10:27.696
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.

01:10:27.897 --> 01:10:29.797
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

01:10:29.999 --> 01:10:31.762
Railroad tracks are frozen.

01:10:31.968 --> 01:10:33.993
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...

01:10:34.204 --> 01:10:37.766
...at least 3 have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.

01:10:37.976 --> 01:10:40.274
The governor of Colorado
is expected...

01:10:40.479 --> 01:10:42.208
...to declare
a weather emergency.

01:10:42.415 --> 01:10:44.246
The National Guard
might be called out...

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:45.644
...to clear streets and roads.

01:10:45.852 --> 01:10:48.082
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:50.279
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

01:10:50.491 --> 01:10:53.119
...with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

01:10:53.327 --> 01:10:56.319
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:58.761
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

01:10:58.968 --> 01:11:00.936
Local beaches
should bejammed.

01:11:01.136 --> 01:11:03.161
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

01:11:03.372 --> 01:11:06.638
...will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.

01:16:38.329 --> 01:16:42.960
We're sorry. Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

01:16:43.302 --> 01:16:46.430
If you need assistance,
please call the operator.

01:17:03.691 --> 01:17:05.523
Yes, it's me.

01:17:05.727 --> 01:17:07.160
Thank God.

01:17:11.834 --> 01:17:13.598
Did you find anything?

01:17:13.804 --> 01:17:16.534
No. Nothing at all.

01:17:17.141 --> 01:17:20.305
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

01:17:23.048 --> 01:17:26.540
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

01:17:26.752 --> 01:17:28.311
Yes, I did.

01:17:28.789 --> 01:17:30.586
And you didn't see anything at all?

01:17:30.791 --> 01:17:32.782
Absolutely nothing.

01:17:32.993 --> 01:17:34.255
How is he?

01:17:34.461 --> 01:17:36.259
He's still asleep.

01:17:36.664 --> 01:17:37.790
Good.

01:17:43.605 --> 01:17:46.699
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

01:17:51.182 --> 01:17:53.673
Are you sure it was the right room?

01:17:53.884 --> 01:17:57.047
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

01:17:57.254 --> 01:17:59.621
He must have gone in that room.

01:17:59.825 --> 01:18:02.487
The door was open,
the lights were on.

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:07.463
I just don't understand it.

01:18:11.805 --> 01:18:14.832
What about those bruises
on his neck?

01:18:17.012 --> 01:18:19.344
Somebody did that to him.

01:18:27.623 --> 01:18:29.056
I think...

01:18:30.728 --> 01:18:33.288
...he did it to himself.

01:18:39.303 --> 01:18:40.531
No.

01:18:41.205 --> 01:18:43.230
That's not possible.

01:18:48.548 --> 01:18:52.211
Once you rule out his version
of what happened...

01:18:52.452 --> 01:18:55.047
...there is no other explanation.

01:18:55.523 --> 01:18:56.854
Is there?

01:18:59.226 --> 01:19:02.128
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode...

01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:05.697
...that he had before
we came up here.

01:19:05.901 --> 01:19:07.129
Would it?

01:19:15.045 --> 01:19:18.038
Whatever the explanation is...

01:19:21.486 --> 01:19:22.885
...I think we...

01:19:23.088 --> 01:19:25.819
...have to get Danny out of here.

01:19:30.597 --> 01:19:32.429
Get him out of here?

01:19:36.604 --> 01:19:38.333
You mean...

01:19:39.373 --> 01:19:41.342
...just leave the hotel?

01:19:50.321 --> 01:19:51.788
It is so...

01:19:51.989 --> 01:19:54.423
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

01:19:54.625 --> 01:19:57.151
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

01:19:57.362 --> 01:19:59.922
When I'm really into my work!

01:20:00.132 --> 01:20:04.092
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?

01:20:04.303 --> 01:20:08.034
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.

01:20:08.241 --> 01:20:10.334
Any of that appeal to you?

01:20:11.546 --> 01:20:14.242
I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

01:20:14.449 --> 01:20:18.078
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:38.309
Good evening. Forest Service.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.313
My name is Dick Hallorann.

01:21:40.515 --> 01:21:42.949
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

01:21:43.151 --> 01:21:45.279
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

01:21:45.488 --> 01:21:49.049
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

01:21:49.259 --> 01:21:52.558
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

01:21:52.764 --> 01:21:56.359
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

01:21:56.568 --> 01:21:59.230
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

01:21:59.437 --> 01:22:02.669
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:04.536
And with this storm
and everything...

01:22:04.744 --> 01:22:07.645
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

01:22:07.847 --> 01:22:09.839
...just to see if
everything's okay.

01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:11.647
I'll be glad to do that.

01:22:11.852 --> 01:22:14.650
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

01:22:14.856 --> 01:22:16.881
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.

01:22:17.091 --> 01:22:18.524
All right, sir.

01:22:38.849 --> 01:22:40.818
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

01:22:41.019 --> 01:22:42.486
Good evening.

01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:08.516
Hi, Lloyd.

01:23:08.718 --> 01:23:10.583
Been away, but now I'm back.

01:23:10.854 --> 01:23:12.583
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

01:23:13.256 --> 01:23:14.245
It's good to see you.

01:23:14.458 --> 01:23:17.120
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

01:23:17.762 --> 01:23:19.492
What'll it be, sir?

01:23:20.299 --> 01:23:22.563
Hair of the dog that bit me.

01:23:23.969 --> 01:23:25.630
Bourbon on the rocks.

01:23:26.473 --> 01:23:27.872
That'll do her.

01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:43.655
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

01:23:45.094 --> 01:23:47.062
No charge?

01:23:47.697 --> 01:23:49.689
Your money's no good here.

01:23:55.339 --> 01:23:57.068
Orders from the house.

01:24:00.279 --> 01:24:02.770
Orders from the house.

01:24:06.018 --> 01:24:08.009
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

01:24:10.222 --> 01:24:14.751
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

01:24:17.064 --> 01:24:19.999
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

01:24:20.201 --> 01:24:22.136
At least, not at this point.

01:24:26.942 --> 01:24:29.343
Anything you say, Lloyd.

01:24:29.779 --> 01:24:31.770
Anything you say.

01:24:44.764 --> 01:24:47.232
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:49.801
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:52.563
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

01:24:53.807 --> 01:24:57.436
That's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

01:24:57.645 --> 01:25:00.444
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

01:25:00.649 --> 01:25:01.775
Advocaat, is it?

01:25:01.984 --> 01:25:04.145
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...

01:25:04.353 --> 01:25:06.548
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

01:25:06.755 --> 01:25:09.281
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

01:25:10.126 --> 01:25:13.425
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:14.619
...Jeevesy old boy.

01:25:14.831 --> 01:25:17.995
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

01:25:18.303 --> 01:25:20.703
Awfully nice of you to say.

01:25:21.139 --> 01:25:24.007
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:26.474
...before the fish and
goose soiree.

01:25:26.679 --> 01:25:28.704
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:30.246
Here. I'll just...

01:25:31.051 --> 01:25:33.315
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

01:25:33.521 --> 01:25:35.318
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

01:25:36.357 --> 01:25:39.987
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

01:25:40.196 --> 01:25:41.458
All right. I'll just...

01:25:41.664 --> 01:25:45.862
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

01:25:46.435 --> 01:25:47.869
Won't keep you a moment.

01:25:48.071 --> 01:25:49.470
Fine.

01:25:52.543 --> 01:25:54.203
What do they call you,
Jeevesy?

01:25:54.411 --> 01:25:56.971
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

01:26:01.753 --> 01:26:02.584
Grady?

01:26:02.788 --> 01:26:04.119
Yes, sir.

01:26:05.291 --> 01:26:06.622
Delbert Grady.

01:26:06.825 --> 01:26:08.349
That's right, sir.

01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:18.504
Mr. Grady...

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:21.367
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

01:26:21.577 --> 01:26:24.273
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

01:26:31.321 --> 01:26:33.152
It's coming off now, sir.

01:26:38.095 --> 01:26:39.653
Mr. Grady...

01:26:41.167 --> 01:26:43.635
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

01:26:43.836 --> 01:26:46.634
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

01:26:49.676 --> 01:26:53.009
You a married man, are you,
Mr. Grady?

01:26:53.213 --> 01:26:54.043
Yes, sir.

01:26:54.247 --> 01:26:57.513
I have a wife and
two daughters, sir.

01:26:58.553 --> 01:27:00.077
And...

01:27:01.757 --> 01:27:03.019
...where are they now?

01:27:03.225 --> 01:27:07.287
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

01:27:17.975 --> 01:27:20.376
You were the caretaker here.

01:27:21.848 --> 01:27:23.839
I recognize you.

01:27:25.218 --> 01:27:28.279
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

01:27:28.722 --> 01:27:30.485
You...

01:27:30.958 --> 01:27:34.485
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

01:27:34.995 --> 01:27:36.395
And...

01:27:37.032 --> 01:27:38.966
...then you blew your brains out.

01:27:48.878 --> 01:27:50.641
That's strange, sir.

01:27:51.648 --> 01:27:54.378
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

01:27:58.055 --> 01:27:59.921
Mr. Grady...

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:03.691
...you were the caretaker here.

01:28:11.504 --> 01:28:14.268
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

01:28:16.143 --> 01:28:17.872
But you...

01:28:18.612 --> 01:28:20.443
...are the caretaker.

01:28:22.719 --> 01:28:25.620
You've always been the caretaker.

01:28:28.524 --> 01:28:30.356
I should know, sir.

01:28:31.795 --> 01:28:34.389
I've always been here.

01:28:52.619 --> 01:28:54.815
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

01:28:55.056 --> 01:28:56.819
...that your son...

01:28:57.225 --> 01:28:59.921
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

01:29:00.128 --> 01:29:02.324
...into this situation?

01:29:04.901 --> 01:29:06.596
Did you know that?

01:29:12.843 --> 01:29:14.936
He is, Mr. Torrance.

01:29:17.282 --> 01:29:18.442
Who?

01:29:20.685 --> 01:29:22.312
A nigger.

01:29:26.393 --> 01:29:27.792
A nigger?

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:31.963
A nigger...

01:29:32.165 --> 01:29:33.258
...cook.

01:29:39.773 --> 01:29:41.036
How?

01:29:43.311 --> 01:29:45.074
Your son...

01:29:45.514 --> 01:29:48.313
...has a very great talent.

01:29:49.286 --> 01:29:52.778
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

01:29:53.523 --> 01:29:56.755
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

01:29:56.961 --> 01:29:58.929
...against your will.

01:30:07.473 --> 01:30:08.735
Well...

01:30:11.511 --> 01:30:14.572
...he is a very willful boy.

01:30:16.984 --> 01:30:19.385
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

01:30:19.588 --> 01:30:22.489
A very willful boy.

01:30:22.691 --> 01:30:24.022
A rather...

01:30:24.226 --> 01:30:25.750
...naughty boy...

01:30:25.962 --> 01:30:29.160
...if I may be so bold, sir.

01:30:36.407 --> 01:30:38.170
It's his mother.

01:30:40.311 --> 01:30:41.778
She...

01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:43.972
...interferes.

01:30:47.087 --> 01:30:50.181
Perhaps they need a good...

01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:51.983
...talking-to.

01:30:52.426 --> 01:30:53.256
lf...

01:30:53.461 --> 01:30:56.225
...you don't mind my saying so.

01:30:57.031 --> 01:30:58.659
Perhaps...

01:30:59.201 --> 01:31:00.896
...a bit more.

01:31:04.106 --> 01:31:05.334
My girls, sir...

01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:09.341
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

01:31:10.014 --> 01:31:13.917
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

01:31:14.119 --> 01:31:16.781
...and tried to burn it down.

01:31:17.856 --> 01:31:19.517
But I...

01:31:19.724 --> 01:31:21.691
...corrected them, sir.

01:31:23.028 --> 01:31:27.158
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

01:31:27.366 --> 01:31:28.628
...I...

01:31:29.636 --> 01:31:31.729
...corrected her.

01:31:45.988 --> 01:31:47.922
We have the Snowcat.

01:31:51.328 --> 01:31:53.092
If the weather breaks...

01:31:53.297 --> 01:31:55.060
...we might just be able...

01:31:55.266 --> 01:31:57.131
...to get down the mountain.

01:32:00.004 --> 01:32:02.974
I could call
the forest rangers first...

01:32:03.175 --> 01:32:04.472
...and...

01:32:04.810 --> 01:32:06.675
...tell them that we're coming...

01:32:07.046 --> 01:32:08.206
...so that...

01:32:08.414 --> 01:32:12.511
...they could start searching
for us in case we didn't make it.

01:32:16.291 --> 01:32:18.452
And if Jack won't come with us...

01:32:20.929 --> 01:32:24.661
...I'll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.

01:32:24.867 --> 01:32:26.835
That's all there is to it.

01:32:28.205 --> 01:32:29.695
Redrum.

01:32:30.674 --> 01:32:32.336
Redrum.

01:32:43.589 --> 01:32:44.749
What's the matter, hon?

01:32:44.957 --> 01:32:45.855
Redrum!

01:32:46.058 --> 01:32:48.118
Are you having a bad dream?

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.297
Hon?

01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:05.012
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.

01:33:10.019 --> 01:33:11.544
Come on, hon.

01:33:12.523 --> 01:33:13.956
Wake up.

01:33:14.892 --> 01:33:17.156
You just had a bad dream.

01:33:18.562 --> 01:33:20.690
Everything's okay.

01:33:24.769 --> 01:33:28.638
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.

01:33:38.119 --> 01:33:39.916
Wake up!

01:33:41.089 --> 01:33:42.421
Come on.

01:33:42.624 --> 01:33:44.148
Right now.

01:33:44.626 --> 01:33:45.991
Wake up!

01:33:50.034 --> 01:33:54.061
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

01:34:04.182 --> 01:34:07.050
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

01:34:07.253 --> 01:34:10.188
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

01:34:10.491 --> 01:34:12.254
Are you receiving me?

01:34:15.463 --> 01:34:18.921
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

01:34:19.267 --> 01:34:22.066
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

01:34:22.271 --> 01:34:23.932
Do you read me?

01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:31.337
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

01:34:31.549 --> 01:34:34.109
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

01:34:34.318 --> 01:34:36.081
Are you receiving me?

01:35:12.529 --> 01:35:14.394
Good evening. Forest service.

01:35:14.598 --> 01:35:16.829
This is Dick Hallorann again.

01:35:17.035 --> 01:35:20.129
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

01:35:21.372 --> 01:35:25.173
We tried to contact them several
times but they didn't answer.

01:35:25.377 --> 01:35:28.972
Maybe they got their radio
turned off or they can't hear it.

01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:32.083
If you'd like, I'd be glad
to try again later on.

01:35:32.587 --> 01:35:34.714
That's very nice of you.

01:35:34.922 --> 01:35:36.685
I'll call you back later.

01:35:36.891 --> 01:35:37.915
Bye.

01:36:25.014 --> 01:36:28.041
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?

01:36:28.251 --> 01:36:30.412
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:32.212
Thank you very much.

01:37:36.131 --> 01:37:37.063
Durkin's Garage.

01:37:37.265 --> 01:37:38.391
Can I speak to Larry?

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.567
Speaking.

01:37:39.868 --> 01:37:42.359
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.

01:37:42.637 --> 01:37:44.299
Dick! How you doing?

01:37:44.507 --> 01:37:45.872
How's the weather down there?

01:37:46.075 --> 01:37:49.238
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

01:37:49.612 --> 01:37:51.204
What are you doing there?

01:37:51.648 --> 01:37:55.084
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.

01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:56.913
What's the weather like there?

01:37:57.555 --> 01:38:00.423
The snowplows are keeping things
moving in town...

01:38:00.626 --> 01:38:02.560
...but the mountain roads
are blocked.

01:38:03.095 --> 01:38:05.791
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat
to get up there.

01:38:05.998 --> 01:38:07.830
Can you fix me up with one?

01:38:08.034 --> 01:38:10.127
What's the big deal
about getting there today...

01:38:10.337 --> 01:38:11.895
...especially in this weather?

01:38:12.773 --> 01:38:16.232
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem...

01:38:16.445 --> 01:38:18.675
...with the people taking care
of the place.

01:38:18.881 --> 01:38:22.750
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.

01:38:22.952 --> 01:38:24.749
Ullman phoned me last night.

01:38:24.954 --> 01:38:28.321
And I'm supposed to find out
if they have to be replaced.

01:38:29.793 --> 01:38:31.819
How long will it take you
to get here?

01:38:32.163 --> 01:38:33.824
About five hours.

01:38:34.031 --> 01:38:36.261
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.

01:38:36.767 --> 01:38:38.497
Okay, I'll take care of it.

01:38:38.703 --> 01:38:41.536
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.

01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:44.300
That's all right. Drive carefully.

01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:53.314
You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.

01:38:53.519 --> 01:38:56.080
And we have a bad day out there.

01:38:56.290 --> 01:38:59.657
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.

01:38:59.861 --> 01:39:01.351
Many mountain passes...

01:39:01.563 --> 01:39:04.431
...Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...

01:39:04.633 --> 01:39:07.932
...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.

01:39:08.137 --> 01:39:09.799
We hear from the news department...

01:39:10.006 --> 01:39:13.203
...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...

01:39:13.410 --> 01:39:15.002
...and with storms like this...

01:39:15.212 --> 01:39:19.343
...I guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.

01:39:19.518 --> 01:39:22.385
The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...

01:39:22.588 --> 01:39:25.057
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...

01:39:25.258 --> 01:39:28.056
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.

01:39:28.261 --> 01:39:29.626
Get the cows in the barn.

01:39:51.121 --> 01:39:52.179
Hon?

01:39:57.161 --> 01:39:59.595
Listen to me
for a minute, will you?

01:40:03.402 --> 01:40:07.100
I'm just going to go and
talk to Daddy for a few minutes...

01:40:07.307 --> 01:40:09.332
...and I'll be right back.

01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:12.836
I want you to just stay here...

01:40:13.047 --> 01:40:15.538
...and watch your cartoons, okay?

01:40:18.654 --> 01:40:20.122
Okay, hon?

01:40:23.426 --> 01:40:26.292
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.

01:40:35.071 --> 01:40:36.266
All right.

01:40:38.342 --> 01:40:41.243
I'll be back
in just about five minutes.

01:40:42.047 --> 01:40:44.380
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.

01:44:10.757 --> 01:44:12.452
How do you like it?

01:44:19.066 --> 01:44:20.590
How do you like it?

01:44:30.547 --> 01:44:33.209
What are you doing down here?

01:44:37.589 --> 01:44:39.921
I just...

01:44:40.391 --> 01:44:41.415
...wanted...

01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:43.589
...to talk to you.

01:44:45.966 --> 01:44:47.228
Okay.

01:44:47.834 --> 01:44:49.301
Let's talk.

01:44:59.113 --> 01:45:01.105
What do you want to talk about?

01:45:09.026 --> 01:45:12.189
I can't really remember.

01:45:12.997 --> 01:45:15.124
You can't remember.

01:45:15.934 --> 01:45:17.265
No...

01:45:17.636 --> 01:45:19.035
...I can't.

01:45:24.343 --> 01:45:27.608
Maybe it was about Danny?

01:45:29.983 --> 01:45:32.680
Maybe it was about him.

01:45:36.324 --> 01:45:39.624
I think we should discuss Danny.

01:45:42.431 --> 01:45:44.228
I think...

01:45:44.633 --> 01:45:48.400
...we should discuss
what should be done with him.

01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:55.704
What should be done with him?

01:46:00.685 --> 01:46:02.482
I don't know.

01:46:02.988 --> 01:46:04.979
I don't think that's true.

01:46:05.190 --> 01:46:07.784
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:09.689
...about what should be done
with Danny.

01:46:09.896 --> 01:46:12.491
And I'd like to know
what they are.

01:46:14.401 --> 01:46:16.198
Well, I...

01:46:16.503 --> 01:46:20.907
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:24.408
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

01:46:26.649 --> 01:46:29.982
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:31.985
As soon as possible?

01:46:32.589 --> 01:46:34.922
"As soon as possible?"

01:46:37.595 --> 01:46:39.028
Please.

01:46:40.431 --> 01:46:43.697
You believe his health
might be at stake.

01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:46.794
Yes.

01:46:48.141 --> 01:46:50.770
And you are concerned about him.

01:46:53.347 --> 01:46:55.577
And are you concerned about me?

01:46:56.417 --> 01:46:57.578
Of course I am.

01:46:57.786 --> 01:47:00.016
Of course you are!

01:47:00.222 --> 01:47:03.350
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

01:47:03.558 --> 01:47:05.049
What are you talking about?

01:47:05.261 --> 01:47:08.094
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

01:47:08.298 --> 01:47:10.357
...thought about
my responsibilities?

01:47:10.567 --> 01:47:12.832
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

01:47:13.038 --> 01:47:15.836
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

01:47:16.107 --> 01:47:17.938
Has is ever occurred to you...

01:47:18.143 --> 01:47:21.636
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1st?

01:47:21.881 --> 01:47:23.906
Does it matter to you at all...

01:47:24.116 --> 01:47:27.210
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:30.549
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

01:47:30.758 --> 01:47:33.352
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

01:47:33.828 --> 01:47:35.853
Do you have the slightest idea...

01:47:36.064 --> 01:47:39.296
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

01:47:39.668 --> 01:47:42.761
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

01:47:42.970 --> 01:47:45.371
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

01:47:45.574 --> 01:47:47.872
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

01:47:48.077 --> 01:47:49.601
Stay away from me!

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.538
Why?

01:47:51.849 --> 01:47:54.818
I just want to go back to my room.

01:47:55.019 --> 01:47:56.281
Why?

01:47:56.921 --> 01:47:57.785
Well...

01:47:58.923 --> 01:48:00.949
...I'm very confused.

01:48:02.094 --> 01:48:05.757
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

01:48:06.798 --> 01:48:10.735
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

01:48:10.938 --> 01:48:13.702
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

01:48:14.675 --> 01:48:16.166
Stay away from me!

01:48:16.511 --> 01:48:17.808
Please!

01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:19.638
Don't hurt me.

01:48:19.848 --> 01:48:21.179
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:48:21.382 --> 01:48:22.576
Stay away from me!

01:48:22.784 --> 01:48:23.649
Stay away!

01:48:23.853 --> 01:48:24.842
Darling.

01:48:25.054 --> 01:48:26.612
Light of my life.

01:48:27.056 --> 01:48:28.387
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:48:28.591 --> 01:48:30.582
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

01:48:30.795 --> 01:48:32.990
I said,
"I'm not going to hurt you."

01:48:33.197 --> 01:48:35.961
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

01:48:36.234 --> 01:48:39.204
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

01:48:40.272 --> 01:48:41.830
Stay away from me!

01:48:42.341 --> 01:48:43.365
Stay away from me!

01:48:43.575 --> 01:48:45.975
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:48:46.245 --> 01:48:47.770
Stay away from me!

01:48:48.014 --> 01:48:49.072
Stay away!

01:48:49.949 --> 01:48:51.177
Please!

01:48:52.219 --> 01:48:53.982
Stop swinging the bat.

01:48:54.189 --> 01:48:55.451
Stay away from me.

01:48:56.224 --> 01:48:57.521
Put that bat down, Wendy.

01:48:57.726 --> 01:48:59.216
Stop it!

01:49:00.695 --> 01:49:01.821
Give me the bat.

01:49:02.031 --> 01:49:03.157
Please!

01:49:03.399 --> 01:49:05.594
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.

01:49:05.801 --> 01:49:06.859
Stop it!

01:49:07.103 --> 01:49:08.536
Give me the bat.

01:49:08.871 --> 01:49:10.499
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.

01:49:10.707 --> 01:49:12.072
Please stop!

01:49:12.277 --> 01:49:13.471
Give me the bat.

01:49:13.678 --> 01:49:14.906
Stay away from me.

01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.547
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.

01:49:18.951 --> 01:49:19.975
Goddamn-!

01:50:35.273 --> 01:50:36.969
What are you doing?

01:50:39.778 --> 01:50:41.245
Wait a minute.

01:50:42.648 --> 01:50:44.640
What are you doing?

01:50:47.487 --> 01:50:48.715
What are you doing?

01:51:02.605 --> 01:51:04.095
Wait a minute!

01:51:06.475 --> 01:51:08.068
What are you doing?

01:51:08.312 --> 01:51:10.041
Open the door!

01:51:11.348 --> 01:51:12.372
Goddamn it!

01:51:12.582 --> 01:51:16.144
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

01:51:19.857 --> 01:51:21.085
Wendy, listen.

01:51:21.526 --> 01:51:24.462
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

01:51:24.663 --> 01:51:27.131
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.

01:51:41.817 --> 01:51:43.182
Baby.

01:51:44.386 --> 01:51:47.686
I think you hurt my head
real bad.

01:51:49.292 --> 01:51:50.953
I'm dizzy.

01:51:51.961 --> 01:51:54.157
I need a doctor.

01:52:01.039 --> 01:52:02.234
Honey.

01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:07.242
Don't leave me in here.

01:52:15.857 --> 01:52:17.758
I'm going to go now.

01:52:20.829 --> 01:52:22.660
I'm going to try...

01:52:22.865 --> 01:52:25.858
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

01:52:26.569 --> 01:52:28.935
...in the Snowcat today.

01:52:31.174 --> 01:52:33.006
I'll bring back a doctor.

01:52:38.383 --> 01:52:40.249
I'm going to go now.

01:52:47.693 --> 01:52:51.494
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

01:52:52.966 --> 01:52:55.560
You're not going anywhere.

01:52:57.239 --> 01:53:01.369
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

01:53:05.982 --> 01:53:07.677
Go check it out.

01:53:09.819 --> 01:53:12.015
Go check it out!

01:53:15.392 --> 01:53:17.326
Go check it out.

01:55:05.187 --> 01:55:07.587
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

01:55:08.325 --> 01:55:10.293
Delbert Grady.

01:55:11.861 --> 01:55:13.453
Grady?

01:55:33.821 --> 01:55:35.652
Hello, Grady.

01:55:40.329 --> 01:55:42.126
Mr. Torrance...

01:55:44.066 --> 01:55:47.798
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

01:55:48.538 --> 01:55:51.029
...business we discussed.

01:55:57.749 --> 01:56:00.684
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

01:56:01.553 --> 01:56:05.615
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

01:56:06.493 --> 01:56:09.223
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

01:56:09.729 --> 01:56:11.561
I wonder.

01:56:12.733 --> 01:56:14.826
I have my doubts.

01:56:16.037 --> 01:56:20.270
I, and others, have come
to believe...

01:56:20.475 --> 01:56:23.467
...that your heart is not in this.

01:56:24.113 --> 01:56:26.639
That you haven't the belly for it.

01:56:32.823 --> 01:56:37.124
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

01:56:37.962 --> 01:56:39.896
That's all I ask.

01:56:41.434 --> 01:56:45.701
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

01:56:45.906 --> 01:56:47.372
Somewhat more...

01:56:47.573 --> 01:56:49.541
...resourceful.

01:56:49.810 --> 01:56:52.574
She seems to have got
the better of you.

01:56:55.816 --> 01:56:58.479
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:01.381
Only for the moment.

01:57:03.292 --> 01:57:07.457
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

01:57:07.731 --> 01:57:11.394
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

01:57:11.968 --> 01:57:13.527
I fear...

01:57:13.804 --> 01:57:16.364
...that is the only thing to do.

01:57:19.844 --> 01:57:21.938
There's nothing
I look forward to...

01:57:22.147 --> 01:57:26.049
...with greater pleasure,
Mr. Grady.

01:57:27.453 --> 01:57:30.184
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

01:57:31.658 --> 01:57:33.683
I give you my word.

01:58:45.811 --> 01:58:48.372
Redrum.

01:58:49.316 --> 01:58:51.876
Redrum.

02:00:59.868 --> 02:01:01.426
Danny, stop it!

02:01:58.236 --> 02:01:59.703
I'm home.

02:02:37.048 --> 02:02:39.915
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

02:03:05.481 --> 02:03:07.346
I can't get out.

02:03:08.151 --> 02:03:09.277
Run!

02:03:10.119 --> 02:03:11.552
Run and hide!

02:03:12.090 --> 02:03:13.216
Run!

02:03:13.424 --> 02:03:14.652
Quick!

02:03:16.361 --> 02:03:20.890
Little pigs, little pigs,
let me come in.

02:03:26.639 --> 02:03:30.041
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

02:03:31.579 --> 02:03:33.638
Then I'll huff...

02:03:33.848 --> 02:03:35.749
...and I'll puff...

02:03:35.951 --> 02:03:38.010
...and I'll blow your house in!

02:03:52.938 --> 02:03:54.303
Please!

02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:56.803
Don't!

02:03:57.475 --> 02:03:59.000
Don't!

02:04:17.599 --> 02:04:18.827
Stop it!

02:04:23.072 --> 02:04:24.630
Here's Johnny!

02:07:06.596 --> 02:07:07.824
Hello?

02:07:13.271 --> 02:07:15.034
Anybody here?

02:07:37.133 --> 02:07:38.691
Hello?

02:07:51.013 --> 02:07:52.845
Anybody here?

02:08:22.818 --> 02:08:24.753
Anybody here?

02:09:05.769 --> 02:09:07.464
Danny-boy!

02:11:48.325 --> 02:11:50.259
I'm coming!

02:11:52.763 --> 02:11:54.698
I'm coming, Dan!

02:12:55.503 --> 02:12:57.904
Great party, isn't it?

02:13:15.559 --> 02:13:17.789
I'm coming!

02:13:20.365 --> 02:13:22.663
You can't get away!

02:13:26.539 --> 02:13:29.031
I'm right behind you!

02:17:27.419 --> 02:17:29.445
- Mommy!
- Danny, come here!

02:17:30.657 --> 02:17:32.387
Mommy.

02:17:40.736 --> 02:17:42.135
Where...?

02:17:43.305 --> 02:17:49.269
