57:43.640 --> 57:47.553
Congratulations. You were great.
Really exciting to watch out there.

57:47.760 --> 57:49.671
Well, you know, I thrill to chill.

57:54.120 --> 57:55.792
You can't dance!

57:56.520 --> 57:58.636
Get off the juice,
you'll get a little loose!

57:58.840 --> 58:01.400
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Is like that?

58:02.560 --> 58:04.949
I'll be back. I'll be back.

58:06.880 --> 58:08.518
I hope you don't think this is rude.

58:08.960 --> 58:11.633
You know, I don't B.S., Miss Pagnicci.

58:13.040 --> 58:14.029
You do it to me.

58:14.840 --> 58:19.038
I was wondering if we could go out
for a drink or something, hang.

58:20.240 --> 58:23.232
- I'm flattered. Really, I am.
- You should be.

58:23.480 --> 58:26.916
But I've never dated players.
It gives the wrong impression.

58:27.120 --> 58:30.999
I guess you're saying you're
influenced by what other people think.

58:31.800 --> 58:34.155
I think we all are, in business.

58:34.960 --> 58:36.075
And is...

58:36.760 --> 58:38.159
..."Pagniacci."

58:45.120 --> 58:47.634
Eat this, you fucking pussies!

58:52.680 --> 58:54.159
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry!

58:55.920 --> 58:57.592
Reebok's got this ad campaign...

58:57.800 --> 59:01.509
...ready to go the moment I hit
2000 yards. But is ABC, man.

59:01.720 --> 59:05.679
I don't get the ball, I don't get
my stats, I don't get my money.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.757
This team isn't about your damn stats.

59:07.960 --> 59:09.473
TONY:
Thas a winning attitude, J.

59:09.680 --> 59:11.955
WASHINGTON: How much you paying that
300-pound blocker?

59:12.520 --> 59:13.794
Let him block.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.911
Because he sure can't run like I can.

59:16.120 --> 59:17.439
J-man's got a point.

59:17.640 --> 59:18.789
CAP:
Beamen ain't doing his homework.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.468
He won't read the playbook,
he won't come see the films.

59:21.680 --> 59:24.877
He doesn't even know the names
of the defense he's facing.

59:25.400 --> 59:27.630
He don't give
a gee-whiz about anybody.

59:27.840 --> 59:29.558
He just wants
to make the plays himself.

59:29.760 --> 59:32.479
He's young, Cap.
He doesn't know how to read like you.

59:32.680 --> 59:36.195
What do you mean, he's young?
Come on! He just does what he likes.

59:36.400 --> 59:40.678
He's changing the plays in the huddle.
Plays that you designed, that I love.

59:40.880 --> 59:44.555
He's dissing this play and dissing
that play. "I got a better play!"

59:44.920 --> 59:46.273
Guys, we won.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.035
CROZIER:
Whas the point?

59:48.280 --> 59:50.396
WASHINGTON: I'm trying to get paid!
Thas the point!

59:50.600 --> 59:53.637
CROZIER: The point is, if we don't win,
you can't do your commercials.

59:53.880 --> 59:56.713
What do you know?
You're an offensive coordinator!

59:57.400 --> 59:58.435
Jesus Christ.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.517
WASHINGTON:
Keep your mouth shut.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.395
Get this shit straight, coach.
I'm with you, man.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.874
Is all right, J.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.839
Anything else?

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.748
Hey, guess what?

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.588
Coach suddenly invited me
over for dinner.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.911
Or orders me, more like.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.071
That means you made it, boy.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.836
The coach thinks you're the real deal,
invites you to his house...

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.837
...makes the worst jambalaya.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.997
Better bring some flowers.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.198
Coach gets really pissed off
if you don't bring flowers.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.515
Flowers?

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.788
Trust me, man.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.955
When?

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.195
Saturday.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.598
Thas tight, man.
Got a gig over at my house.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.279
Going to be a lot of trim.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.037
Don't bring no sand to the beach.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.879
Come on, I'm a born-again ladies' man.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.036
I bet you were born again, baby.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.918
With a team, hotshot, you can try
to lead them, but will anyone follow?

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.949
You go out there on your own,
you're gonna die a very lonely death.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.389
You feeling me?

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.919
Say, Cap, how old are you again?

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.397
POWERS: We got a problem.
There's something wrong with Shark.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.989
Brilliant. Did you
go to medical school for that?

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.953
His eye-hand coordination's
deteriorating.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:25.039
He's fucked up. The crazier they are,
the more the crowd likes it.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.834
This isn't pro wrestling.
He needs an MRI.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.670
You gonna order a $20,000 workup
for every nutcase on this team?

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.269
Could have a subdural hematoma,
intracranial bleeding.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.875
Or he could just be
a crazy fucker, okay?

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.553
They walk on that field every Sunday.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.389
The only one thing going for them:
Their confidence.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.433
You chip away at that
with a bunch of unnecessary testing...

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.676
...and we can kiss
the playoffs goodbye.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.110
Are you saying
I can't do the tests on Shark?

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.673
Jesus Christ!

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.477
I'll take care of it.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.956
I have earned their trust.
You haven't. Good night.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.709
Hey, baby.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.438
- Whas the matter?
- Who's Courtney?

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.110
I don't know who Courtney is.
Why are you starting your shit?

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.192
Hi, Turk!

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.590
Whas it like to be a nobody one day
and have the world know you the next?

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.758
I was always a star.
Y'all just didn't know about it.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.234
It ain't the whole world.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.994
Two billion people in China
ain't never heard of the game.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.033
Sharks are in the water.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.198
AGENT: The busboy, Steamin' Beamen.
What you think?

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.913
WILLIE: Is all to the good.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.510
AGENT: Les get out of here.
This studio time ain't cheap.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.555
Take over.
I'll be doing this every day.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.035
WILLIE SINGS:
Gotta get to work

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.629
Thas right

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.390
You know my name

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.795
My name is Willie

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:46.836
MALE CHORUS:
Willie Beamen

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.189
WILLIE:
I keep the ladies

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.510
MALE CHORUS:
Creamin '

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.950
WILLIE: And all my fans
MALE CHORUS: Got 'em screamin '

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.991
WILLIE: Think you can defeat me?
MALE CHORUS: You're dreamin '

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.755
Get set, motherfucker.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.752
Then we can get in the gym.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.235
CAP: Give generously
to Child Find of America.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.677
WILLIE: And les make every kid
feel like a superstar.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.791
KIDS:
Willie! Willie!

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.194
You should have fought for
that "superstar" line.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.636
"Giving." "Team sport."

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.273
Those are the lines.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.431
Meanwhile, honey,
you used to do this spot alone.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.188
Hit it!

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.069
Finished?

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.633
Take care of Julian for me?

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.915
POWERS:
I know this guy.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.559
He's a top plastic surgeon.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.556
I think I could get him
to see you tonight.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.192
Oh, motherfucker!

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.635
I will run this town

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.110
Guaranteed first down

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.117
Inflate your chest. Get MET-Rx.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.839
Yo, Rocky.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.675
Enough. You're gonna hurt yourself.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.551
Kiďs breathing down my neck.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.631
Jack, he's not even close.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.073
You're the man.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.989
- Less on the ball, Willie.
- What?

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.350
You want a cool, tight spiral.
Don't pat the ball.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.869
It was tight as a frog's ass.
I'm the man.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.231
You're the man. I repeat, don't
pat the ball. Whad he say?

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.596
I said, "I'm as tight as fish pussy."

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.632
I need an interpreter.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.513
Okay, Cap. Sit down.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.988
I'm fine. Fine.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.474
You got the balls.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.716
Come on, just get some rest.
Les go.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.716
MANDRAKE: Bottom line, Rooney is like
some kind of medical miracle.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.991
He really could be ready for New York.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.829
CHRISTINA:
Have you told anyone?

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.235
CAP: I've been on for 12 years
and two rings.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.910
Give me a break. I played hurt before.
Is no big deal.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.669
He's so freaked about Beamen taking his
job, he'd play with a fractured neck.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.228
Could you slow him down?

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.598
Tell him he's not responding
to rehab well enough.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.119
Les give Beamen a shot.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.436
TONY: We're going with Willie
against New York.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.879
Rest up till the playoffs.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.594
The Emperors don't mean enough for you
to risk everything.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.314
CAP: Home-field advantage.
That don't mean anything?

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.994
Well...

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.438
Everyone knows
herniated discs are iffy.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.119
This is how it starts, huh?

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.436
I know what you're talking about.
I know how your mind works.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.949
"Rest up."
"Let the kid take a few games."

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.513
"You were great, but time marches on."

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.790
- Thas not what I'm saying.
- The heck you're not.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.592
I know the game of football.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.712
- What about Shark?
- He's woozy still.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.832
He's got bad migraines,
postconcussive syndrome.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.634
MANDRAKE:
Don't get a hard-on. Don't move.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.875
Can you clear him?

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.031
MANDRAKE:
He's had 3 concussions in 5 months.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.314
There's no way to predict what
another head hit would do.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.158
I don't think anything'll happen,
but I'm not a complete prick.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.799
I do have a conscience.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.230
I'm not trying to screw him, Harvey...

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.038
...but I'd like him in the playoffs.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.158
Long-term, what are you thinking?

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.279
What am I thinking?

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.079
Bottom line?

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.951
We'll cut him in the off-season.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.508
The worďs out.
Everyone's seen him take the hits.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.719
Nobody's gonna sign a
two-million-dollar concussion case.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:55.551
He'll be happy to have his job back
at 30% of what he makes.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.473
Thas if we want him back.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.477
He's got four kids, Christina.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.832
You do the math, doctor.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.711
What you help save us now,
we won't forget at contract time.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.073
What do I tell Tony?

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.432
Tell him what he needs to know.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.911
Shark can play. Cap can't.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.638
TONY:
- In these high beautiful heels.

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:27.276
So...

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.154
- You know what you need?
TONY: A pump.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.189
You need to be...

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.874
...young again!

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.599
TONY:
You got me!

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.115
[LAUGHING]

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:45.392
I like going downfield.
Thas my game. I open it wide open.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.394
The fans want it. Old-timers
don 't dig it, like Coach Stone Age.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.553
ROSE: I beg your pardon? "Coach
Stone Age"? Is that what you just said?

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.478
Is up and is good, baby!

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.875
Thas a name I give him.
I don 't mean disrespect.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.116
ROSE: Tell me about your past.
Where did you start?

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:03.591
In Houston, but the coach
didn 't dig having a black quarterback.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.076
I guess he felt our brains
was no bigger than the tip of his...

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.997
WILLIE:
And then I went to San Diego.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.794
Coach made me cornerback
because he felt I had quick feet.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.274
MAND Y:
No, wait. Leave him on. He's cool.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.154
TONY: "Cool"?
- Yeah.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.028
Thinks he's Joe Montana already.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.559
They didn 't know what I was.

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:25.432
I mean, he doesn't buy into the
bullshit, you know? I like his eyes.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.073
Life ain 't fair.
And fair ain 't what I'm here for.

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:31.228
He's sure of himself.
It makes him sexy.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.751
I'm glad I'm old.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.149
Check all right?

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:40.518
I'm not surprised. Rookie thinks he's
hot shit and all-pro all of a sudden.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.591
Did you feed the dogs?

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.836
- Put the kids to bed.
- Can't we afford a maid?

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.314
Why'd I get married?

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:52.274
Are you saying black people
are being dissed in this league?

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.757
I see what you're doing.
You're doing that media spin.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.111
Les talk about the facts.
70% of the league is African-American.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.278
- How many black coaches do you have?
- Very few.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.198
- How many black owners?
- None.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.270
Zero.

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:10.156
At what point does the "Uncle Tom"
feel come into it? Not my language...!

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.595
It is because we didn 't speak it
when we got here.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.717
ROSE:
But "Coach Stone Age"...?

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.554
Your smack is so fresh, so on time
and truthful. Give me a pound, dog.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.756
- Share the love.
- I'll pass on the love.

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.991
You get it started, okay?

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.629
- Hope you like cream in your coffee.
- Yes, I do.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.275
Mandy...

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.714
...I like you.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.428
I'm wondering,
maybe we could make this...

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.108
...you know, a more regular thing.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.197
Yeah, I got a few clients like that.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.193
We could book a regular time.
I'll give you my number...

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.193
No, I sort of meant...
Not like that.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.314
Without the money.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.474
- I know, but...
- No, you don't want to do this.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.033
I really like you.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.914
I like you too.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.111
Tony, you don't want to do this.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.748
Call me.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.677
You got pretty hair.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.708
Okay.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.035

- These for me?

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.196
- Thank you.
- Carnations.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.517
I'll put them in water or something.
Come on in.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.513
Want a beer?

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.670
Yeah.

Sharky motherfucker.

Nice spot.

TONY:
Yeah, isn't it?

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.875

The gladiators of their time.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.069

Oh, yeah.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.278
WILLIE:
Thas what is all about.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.830
TONY: I don't cook so well,
but you gotta try this jambalaya.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.268
- Ready?
- I'm always ready.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.074
TONY:
It was my recipe. Sort of.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.068
How do you like it?

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.592
Is... hot.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.473
Les talk about some basics.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.636
You getting ready to yell at me?

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.596
Cap going down was tough on me.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:48.872
I realize you're learning the system.
Pressure must be incredible.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.638
- I can handle it.
- I know you can.

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.152
If the playbook is too complicated,
we simplify it.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.310
Playbook's too slow.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.028
When I'm on the field,
I gotta feel it, gotta let it out.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.674
Thas why you change the plays?

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.279
I'm just trying to read the defense.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.836
I'm not talking about audibles.
Talking about in the huddle.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.753
When you change plays,
you show disrespect to people.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.157
TONY: People who have worked years
in this club.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.234
People who've sacrificed more than
you'll ever know to be in this game.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.759
I'm trying to win, coach!

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:23.272
I ain't trying to disrespect nobody.
Winning is the only thing I respect.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.319
Listen very carefully.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.678
One day you'll realize this is
the truest thing you ever heard.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:31.839
This game...

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.832
This game has got to be
about more than winning.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.633
You're part of something.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.991
Lombardi, Tittle, Sammy Baugh, Unitas.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:48.158
Those men on the wall.
You're part of that now.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.119
I want you to cherish it
because when is gone...

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.151
...is gone forever.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:58.308
When I look at them pictures
and trophies, it just makes me sad.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.951
WILLIE:
Is like a room full of ghosts.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.192
When I'm done with this game...

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.750
...I don't want to be no ghost.
I wanna be more than that.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.792
Looks like Cap's gonna make it
back in time for the playoffs.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.755
- What?
- I'm gonna start him.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.869
I knew you were gonna sell me out.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.957
TONY:
Cap's a leader. He's a team player.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.757
WILLIE: Thas such bullshit!
He ain't half the athlete I am.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.430
You look me in the eye and tell me
that Cap is a better player.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.755
Cap's a better player.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.396
I guess somebody else
won them last two games.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.716
He lost four in a row!
I lead by doing.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.989
You kicked ass.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.760
But Cap Rooney has been doing it
for years.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.393
And his time is over.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.068

unless you take some risk!

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.111
Play this game the way
is played today.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.276
Is not about
the pictures on the wall!

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:57.114
TONY: I've lived this game
for three decades, kid!

01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:58.275
I know football.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.753
TONY: Those men on the wall...
WILLIE: They wanted to win.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.269
Just like you do.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.838
You can feed the press that whole
sacrifice and glory-of-the-game crap.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.155
But I been there.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.916
I seen a long line of coaches...

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.714
...with that same old bullshit
halftime speech.

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.638
- Bullshit?
- Yes, is bullshit.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.877
WILLIE: You know is bullshit
because is about the money.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.992
The Tv contracts,
fat-cat boosters in the skyboxes.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.519
Coaches trying to up their salaries.

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.030
You looking for the next black stud
to take it to the top 10.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.793
Get you in a bowl game.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.316
Is the same way in the pros.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.238
Except in the pros,
the field hands get paid.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.516
Don't play that race card on me, kid.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.756
25 years I work with men
of your color.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.428
WILLIE: Maybe is not racism.
Maybe is placism.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.631
Brother has to know his place.
Right, boss?

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.190
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.399
You don't trust anybody
because of what happened in college?

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.592
You knew the rules.
You were the one that broke them.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.950
- How did I break them?
- How?

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.153
I lost a million-dollar
signing bonus...

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.473
...because I took a $300 suit
from a booster to go to a wedding.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.031
Whas a brother supposed to do
in college? He ain't got money.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.596
He wants to go out on a date.
Wants to get some nice clothes.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.991
Everybody had their hands out...

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.872
...but it was me they suspended.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.794
I dropped six rounds in the draft
because of that.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.834
The coaches labeled me: "He's trouble.
He don't wanna play ball."

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.234
You talk about sacrifice.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.439
I sacrificed $ 10 million because dumb
rednecks like the coach in San Diego...

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.437
...made me a cornerback
because I got quick feet.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.518
He separated my shoulder tackling
250-pound motherfuckers.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:36.675
I don't do that!

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.872
I was a great football player.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.233
But nobody let my shoulder heal,
and they traded me out of there.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:47.239
You go ahead.
Blame everybody but yourself.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.310
Whatever.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.199
Because thas what a leader's about.
Sacrifice.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:56.036
TONY: The times he's gotta sacrifice
because he's gotta lead by example.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.276
Not by fear and not by self-pity.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.388
Who you think you're talking to?

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.512
Half my career is over
and you want me on the bench...

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.792
...to sacrifice for the glory
of Cap Rooney? Fuck you!

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.673
I ain't buying your brand.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.877
Just because you some scared old man.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.231
You feel like if I play my way,
I just might win.

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.675
Then what was your life about anyway?

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.759
You're not some flash-in-the-pan
corner or receiver...

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.873
...or even Julian Washington.
You're a goddamn quarterback!

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.752
TONY:
You know what that means?!

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.071
Is the top spot, kid.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.952
Is the guy takes the fall.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.312
Is the guy everybody's looking at
first, the leader of a team.

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.909
Who will support you
when they understand you.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:46.430
Who will break their ribs and their
noses and their necks for you...

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.633
...because they believe.
Because you make them believe.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.559
Thas a quarterback.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.708
Yeah.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.437
I'm the leader of your team...

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.474
...till Cap's back up.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.272
Then I'm back on the bench.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.877
You ain't said two words to me
till Cherubini went down.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.032
Then it was, "Go out there and...

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.632
...play like you're in the 'hood.
You're throwing the ball...

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.560
...and your mama's
ringing the dinner bell."

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.638
All you do is talk at me, man.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.912
I'm gonna stay who I am.
Steamin' Willie Beamen.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.115
With the time I got left,
I'll play my way. Get my dollars up.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:37.074
So when you go to waive me, trade me
or whatever the fuck y'all do...

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.875
...I'll be worth 10 times what
I was worth before I got here.

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.996
You're very, very young.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.992
And you're very, very stupid.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.637

Whare you doing? Get off the lawn!

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.151
Is Mr. Beamen. How you doing?

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:20.158
Is about winning. Thas what this
country's about. Being number one.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.190
This whole country was built
on kicking immigrant ass.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.233
African ass, Chinese ass.

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:09.878
The one that starts, "Do no harm"?

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:13.829
With all due respect, I didn't
have to ask because I knew the answer.

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.918
Who am I to tell these men
they cannot live their dream?

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.032
They won't live with shame like you.

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.595
They are gladiators.
They are warriors!

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.836
And long ago, they made that choice.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.712
Not you! Not you!

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:30.750
Not me. I won't be responsible
for standing between them...

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.879
Didn't you ever have...

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.359
...a dream, Ollie?

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.152
I'm living it, Harv.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.515
Oh, fuck it.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.714
We did win the Pantheon though,
didn't we?

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.190
See you around the old nursing homes.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:54.674
Courtney, les go.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.237
No. I'm gonna stay here.

01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.757
- What?
- Please.

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:00.949
MANDRAKE:
Perfect. Stay here.

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:05.153

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:10.870
Out of my way!

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.398
Well, thas just great.

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:17.109
Thas just fucking great!

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.235
Did you get that?

Nobody's gonna hit your pussy-ass.

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.916
I know, man. I just got happy feet.
I'm getting old.

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:47.394
I should just trust that you'll
do the right thing for Willie B.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.670
Is it true you make 10 million a year?

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.790
Thas right.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.719
It must be true about you
not blocking no more either.

01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:59.589
KID: Dad says you won't take passes up
the middle because you might get hurt.

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.394
Whas that?

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.517
SHARK: You led, nigger.
But did anybody follow?

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.958
Let me tell you something:

01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.391
For every sucker who makes it...

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:44.758
...for every Barry Sanders,
for every Jerry Rice...

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:47.874
...there's a hundred niggers
you never heard of.

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.119
Sure. The game's taught you
how to strut...

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.716
...how to talk shit, how to hit.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.268
But what else?

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.710
Suddenly, there's no more money...

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.594
...no more women, no more applause.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.314
No more dream.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.150
This is what I'm trying to say to you.

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.159
When a man...

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.197
...Iooks back on his life,
he should be proud of all of it.

01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.999
Not just the years he spent
in pads and cleats.

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.192
Not just memories of...

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.879
...when he was great.

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:42.432
You gotta learn that in here.

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.474
If you don't, you ain't a man.
You're just another punk.

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:19.516
Hey, Cindy!

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.549
A little help?

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:23.109
Come on.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.153
TONY: Paper's got us at six-point dogs.
You believe that?

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:31.829
I can't wait to strap it on and stick
it to Dallas like we used to.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.635
Show them what this game's all about,
right there in the playoffs.

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.314
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.517
Doc got it wrong about your back?

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:46.550
It hurts a lot more than I thought.
I think I pushed it too hard.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.955
Don't play hurt.
You just need the needle.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.957
Yeah, I'm sure thas it.

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.831
Maybe you ought to go with Willie.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.678

Are you seeing your psychiatrist?

No.

Well, are you depressed?

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.592
Rock, come on!

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.156
You wanted to play. I fought for you.

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:09.750
If something was wrong, you
shoulďve told me. I had four weeks.

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:11.837
I coulďve gone another way!

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.675
I'm sorry.

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.036
I got blank spots in my memory.
Is weird.

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.230
And I shake.

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:31.911
Sometimes I can't even hold a spoon.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:37.074
And I'm always on painkillers
for my elbow...

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:39.834
...or my rib or my neck!

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.634
Now I got this ruptured disc,
and I just...

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.758
Even with all that,
I would go back in a second...

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.752
But if I go in there, Tony...

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.318
...I'm gonna fold.

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:00.839
And I just...

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.312
I can't do that.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:12.075
You know these things you're saying...

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.752
...all in your head, Rock.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:17.199
They're not real.

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.439
You understand?

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.070
You know you got it in you...

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.959
...because I know you do.

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:29.913
Is my body, Tony.

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.519
Is my body. Is not there.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.312
I wouldn't let you get hurt.

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.439
I need you, Rock...

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.032
...to lead this team.

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.754
Come on.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.828
One more time.

we took care of our money...

...and the kids are all right.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.678
We had a good run.
I just think that is time for me...

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:23.028
...to get out after this season.

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.999
And do what?

01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:28.394
I talked to a guy
at one of the networks...

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.636
You are a football player.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.757
Will you hear me out?

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.678
You're a football player, Jack.

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:39.714
And you have two or three years
left in you.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.549
Cindy, you are missing
the big picture here.

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.672
There is no big picture here, Jack!

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.713
You're the goddamn quarterback
for the Miami Sharks!

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.673
You're a legend,
and you're talking about quitting?

01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:58.439
All my life people have been telling me
what to do, ever since college!

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:01.154
This is not your decision!
It is my decision...!

Everything was just happening so fast,
I didn't have time to think.

I was thinking maybe we could go out,
we could just get together.

I don't think so, Willie. I'm sorry.

Okay, okay.

I like simple things.

Listen to me. I just need to know

Willie, no.

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:39.750
Tell me that I can call you,

You're so full of shit.

Get out of here!

You're talking about

You're just jealous because he's tall.

In the off-season, I'm trading Willie.

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:39.720
You will start Willie on Sunday...

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.229
...and you'll make the adjustment
to modern times.

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.038
You don't tell me what to do.

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.759
Nobody tells me what to do!

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:49.555
Your father never told me what to do!
You're not gonna start!

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.877
I'd cut my father's ass
if we were losing like this.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.675
You know, I'm really getting
sick and tired of you.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.070
Your father was no genius.

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.431
He only acted like he was one.

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:04.797
And he took credit for a lot of things
he never did!

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.070
He at least respected me.

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:10.272
CHRISTINA: Would you stop using
my father as a scapegoat?

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:14.910
I can't even imagine what he'd think
of you right now...

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.795
...but my hunch is, he'd be ashamed.
He'd be ashamed!

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.709
Why do you think he put me in charge,
you bullheaded moron?

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:26.117
He coulďve made you general manager,
but he didn't, did he?

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:27.799
You know why?

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.879
He knew you didn't have the guts
to do it after he was gone!

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.478
Is true, Tony.
He couldn't trust you.

TONY:
I'm losing the team, Maggie.

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.797
I'm losing control.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.911
Everything in my life's about control.

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.269
I lead men.

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.598
I control.

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.431
Did Art think I was past it?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.194
I don't know.

01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:59.239
Do you care?

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:02.318
You never understood Artie,
did you?

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.509
He wanted a son...

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:08.194
...more than anything else
in the world.

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.638
MARGARET: And when you really think
about it, what Christina is...

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.036
...is just such a tragedy.

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.992
You know, she will sell the team.

01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.234
And everything her father
stood for is gonna die.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:30.879
And what will you do, Tony,
after football...

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.234
...with nobody to control?

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.797
Stop it. What are you doing?

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:40.313
Hey, I blame you for a lot of things.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.719
You were like Artie.

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:47.158
A monster.

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:51.318
You've gotten older. Better.

01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:57.159
But for a long time I hated you.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:02.956
That game took my husband,
my daughter...

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:04.752
...my youth.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.274
Left me with what?

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:10.595

Either we heal as a team...

I look around, I see these
young faces, and I think...

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:52.195
...I made every wrong choice
a middle-aged man can make.

01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:59.076
I pissed away all my money,
believe it or not.

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:03.671
I chased off anyone
who's ever loved me.

01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:10.196
And lately, I can't even stand
the face I see in the mirror.

01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:18.719
You know, when you get old in life,
things get taken from you.

01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.911
I mean, thas part of life.

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.156
But you only learn that
when you start losing stuff.

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.553
You find out life's this game
of inches.

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:32.119
So is football.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.436
Because in either game,
life or football...

01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:39.518
...the margin for error is so small...

01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:44.553
...one-half a step too late or early,
and you don't quite make it.

01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:48.389
One half-second too slow, too fast,
you don't quite catch it.

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:52.832
The inches we need are
everywhere around us.

01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:58.030
They're in every break of the game,
every minute, every second.

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.597
On this team, we fight for that inch.

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:06.511
On this team, we tear ourselves...

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:11.157
...and everyone else around us
to pieces for that inch.

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:14.552
We claw with our fingernails
for that inch...

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:18.998
...because we know when we add up
all those inches...

01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:24.750

difference between winning and losing!

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.634

...is the guy who's willing to die
who's gonna win that inch.

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:40.793
And I know if I'm gonna have
any life anymore...

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:44.789
...is because I'm still willing
to fight and die for that inch.

Look into his eyes!

01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:03.475
I think you're gonna see a guy
who'll go that inch with you!

01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:05.758
You're gonna see a guy...

for this team...

02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:07.033
Comanche.

02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:09.393
Tony, we got nine seconds!

02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:11.830
CROZIER: If he's stopped inbounds,
the game's over.

02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:13.678
This is what coaching's all about.

02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:17.794
TONY:
Hey, Nick, you up for it?

02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:19.269
Spread West Hustle...

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:20.714
West Hustle 60...

02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:22.239
Sixty Comanche?

02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:23.549
Man has balls of iron.

02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:26.191
- We in this together?
- Dynamic duo, baby!

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:31.511
ANNOUNCER:
Nine seconds left to play.

02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:44.755
Mom, Mom, Mom!

02:15:58.520 --> 02:15:59.748
Don't let him out-of-bounds!

02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:02.469
Out!

02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:11.279
Out-of-bounds on the 3!

02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:14.392
Unselfish! Unselfish!
Way to go, Julian!

02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:23.996
- Wait, I don't know where to look.
- Up there.

02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:26.236
You hear that? Thas four seconds.

02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:33.870
ANNOUNCER:
Time-out called by the Knights.

02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:36.549
Dallas 35, Miami 31.

02:16:36.799 --> 02:16:39.314
Now, remember,
see it before you do it.

02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:41.398
TONY:
Julian gave you the shot.

02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:43.317
Make them believe, Willie.

02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:45.397
This time, now.

02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:49.556
One on one, man on man.

02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:51.671
WILLIE:
We do it together, all right?

02:16:51.879 --> 02:16:53.518
I know y'all don't wanna go home.

02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:54.875
It ain't no tomorrow!

02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:09.433
TUG: Three yards to go. Four seconds.
One play.

02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:11.871
We've been in too many of these.

02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:13.468
This one'll get it.

02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:14.907
Four seconds.

02:17:15.959 --> 02:17:18.030
TONY:
Four seconds is a lifetime!

02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:20.236
We're a lifetime away here!

02:17:23.959 --> 02:17:25.109
WILLIE:
Set!

02:17:25.799 --> 02:17:27.233
Rifle 22!

02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:39.196
Hut!

02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:19.152
TUG: I think he lost it!
It didn 't go!

02:18:29.879 --> 02:18:31.632
Watch out! Watch out!

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:32.830
Touchdown!

02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:34.309
Oh, yeah!

02:18:37.559 --> 02:18:39.516
Touchdown! Touchdown!

02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:47.749
Nice night.

02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:51.238
Can't get over Cap.

02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:56.629
I learned more watching him in the
first half than I did in five seasons.

02:19:57.560 --> 02:19:59.551
Next week I'll win it
just for him.

02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:05.676
Glad to see success hasn't
gone to your head too much, kid.

02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:08.155
Who, me? Steamin' Beamen?

02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:10.308
WILLIE:
Nah.

02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:12.278
TONY:
This is your moment, Willie.

02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:14.468
Savor it.

02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:20.596
But never forget. On any given Sunday,
you're either gonna win or lose.

02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:24.470
"But can you win or lose like a man?"
I got it, coach.

02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:31.713
Yeah.

02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:36.273
Next year...

02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:38.398
...I'm out of here.

02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:42.914
I figured.

02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:44.516
TONY:
Yeah.

02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:48.759
I'm not the right guy
for this team anymore.

02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:50.593
WILLIE:
I wouldn't say all that.

02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:54.869
TONY: There was this great quarterback
in the '70s I knew.

02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:58.595
I mean, this guy was one tough
son of a bitch.

02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:01.473
He fought for every inch he ever got.

02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:05.759
He didn't have your natural skills,
but he could make it happen.

02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:08.952
He could win.
But the game passed him by.

02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:11.710
Anyway, I ran into this guy...

02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:14.591
...a few weeks ago in L.A.

02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:18.759
We had a few beers, and we start
talking. You know what he told me?

02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:21.632
He said when he looked back...

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:24.991
...he didn't really miss
the Pantheon Cups...

02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:26.793
...or the girls...

02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:28.428
...or even the glory.

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:30.113
You know what he missed?

02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:35.791
What he missed were those other guys
looking back at him in the huddle.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.274
Those eleven guys...

02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:42.318
...every one of them seeing things
the same way.

02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:44.995
All of them looking downfield...

02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:46.634
...together.

02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:49.313
Thas what he missed.

02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:54.118
I'm gonna miss you, amigo.

02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:57.313
Yeah.

02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:13.833
You know, my arm has been killing me.
I met with a specialist who said...

02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:22.033
I'm scared.

02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:30.509
TONY:
We're all scared.

02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:34.679
If you think is easy being a coach,
I'll trade your microphone for my ulcer.

02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:37.075
I'm a triple-decker
stress sandwich right now.

02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:40.995
Why is that, coach?
The 32-13 loss to San Francisco?

02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:44.789
You're not even close, Johnny.
Try fishing someplace else.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:48.436
CHRISTINA: And I want to live up
to what it is my father left me.

02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:50.279
A legacy.

02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:53.154
A feeling of a bond with this town.

02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:55.595
A feeling that this is our house.

02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:57.870
The Pagniacci house.

02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:05.435
And we have great confidence...

02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:09.269
...that in the final hour,
our mayor will be there for us.

02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:24.514
And Tony...

02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:26.309
Know this.

02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:28.915
Wherever you go, you will always be...

02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:32.833
...Ioved and greatly respected.

02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:35.715
Thank you.

02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:40.671
Thanks for helping me understand again
what I had forgotten.

02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:45.433
Tony D.!

02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:05.313
He's been here 30 years!

02:24:05.720 --> 02:24:07.995
Even the dogs are sad, he said.

02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:15.075
Is been way too long
not to win a big one.

02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:19.711
San Francisco sure
took care of that for us.

02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:23.875
Um...

02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:30.109
In football, as in life, things change.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.516
I guess is time for me to get the
hell out of the way, bring in the new.

02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:41.431
I like Nick Crozier.
I think he'll do a great job.

02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:49.874
But most of all I want to thank
the people of Miami...

02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:56.197
...for their support through
the last 20-some odd years.

02:24:56.720 --> 02:24:58.233
Gee, it just flew by.

02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:04.311
Is really meant a lot to me.

02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:09.958
It meant everything to me.

02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:14.676
I've had a great, great ride,
believe me. And...

02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:16.313
And I'm gonna miss you.

02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:20.193
He's an arrogant son of a bitch,
but I'll miss him.

02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:25.150
In thinking about change...

02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:30.476
...I don't know, I felt maybe it was
time for me to make a change too.

02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:35.596
And it was Willie Beamen taught me
how to give it another shot.

02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:40.192
So starting today...

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.672
...I'm taking over as head coach...

02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:46.959
...for that new expansion team in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Aztecs.

02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:52.312
"Why," do you say? Because they're
giving me full management control.

02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:57.151
But hoping not to make a complete fool
of myself out there...

02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:00.677
...I just signed Willie Beamen
as my starting quarterback...

02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:03.394
...and franchise player for the Aztecs.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:09.391
So, Miss P, I look forward to seeing you
next season across those sidelines.

02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:15.316
So long... Au revoir...

02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.875
See you when the clouds come home.

02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:23.917
Especially you, baby.
Smoking cigars on me now, are you?

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.115
Gotcha!

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.831
MAN:
Thought we had him tied up!

02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:51.149
WILLIE:
All right, little man!

02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:53.470
Whas up? Whas your name?

02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:57.114
Hey, what up, man? What up? What up?

02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:01.673
How y'all feeling?

02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:07.831
All right, now.
Y'all be looking out for the game now.

02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:37.469
