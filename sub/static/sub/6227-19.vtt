00:00.876 --> 00:02.048
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.127 --> 00:03.594
I talked to Sean Renard.

00:03.670 --> 00:04.796
It's Diana.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.280
He said she was
with the Resistance.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.010
I think he's gonna use Diana
to get to me for some reason.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.514
If the Captain is
working with Black Claw,

00:10.594 --> 00:12.187
they're gonna use
Adalind to get to you.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.935
Hey, Wu!

00:14.014 --> 00:15.106
You might be having
low blood sugar.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.183
When was the last time
you ate?

00:16.265 --> 00:17.358
Um...

00:20.395 --> 00:22.022
I think I had something
last night.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.461
Diana?
Mommy.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.542
Diana!

00:44.378 --> 00:45.550
I missed you so much.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.099
I missed you, too.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.778
Follow the light.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.372
Hey.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.545
Sorry, Doc,
don't mean to interrupt.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.126
No, we were just
finishing up.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.586
So, how's he doing?

01:25.669 --> 01:28.263
The MRI was clear. There's
no bleeding, no swelling.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.931
But he still
had a concussion,

01:30.007 --> 01:33.007
so we wanna keep him here for a little
bit longer, and run a few more tests.

01:33.677 --> 01:34.837
I'll be checking
on you later.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.434
Okay. Thanks, Doc.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.191
Thanks for coming.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.436
Ah, we couldn't figure out
a way to get out of it.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.399
No, that's why we bought
chocolates and flowers.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.405
Oh. And where are they?

01:46.481 --> 01:47.858
Oh, we didn't buy
them for you.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.614
It's our reward
for coming here.

01:49.985 --> 01:50.986
Mmm-hmm.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.738
We're glad you're okay.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.244
Yeah.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.122
Well, I just wish I could
remember what happened.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.543
What do you remember?

01:58.869 --> 02:00.496
We were staking
out Monroe.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.877
Then I saw that guy
move toward him.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.126
I thought,
"Okay, here we go."

02:06.001 --> 02:07.298
I woke up here.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.128
Did you get the guy?

02:09.211 --> 02:10.338
Oh, he's been got.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.677
Well, for some reason, the guy who
was supposed to go after Monroe

02:14.760 --> 02:16.353
ended up going
after you instead.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.429
What?

02:17.512 --> 02:20.607
Yeah, he dragged you in front of his van.
He was gonna run you over.

02:20.891 --> 02:21.892
Why me?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.522
You were bleeding
pretty bad.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.737
Oh, so you guys
saved my ass.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.147
Yeah.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.858
That's why I ate the chocolate,
he kept the flowers.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.486
Get some rest.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.162
We'll come back a little
later to check on you.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.237
Okay.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.281
You take care.

02:36.365 --> 02:37.412
Thanks. Thanks for coming.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.168
You worried about him?

02:44.247 --> 02:45.920
Yeah, I'm worried.
Me, too.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.839
Passing out in the precinct,
what was that about?

02:47.918 --> 02:49.841
There is something going on,
I just don't know what.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.672
All right, so we'll
keep an eye on him.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.897
Dr. Decker to ICU.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.739
Got him.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.279
He's in the hospital.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.730
Find what
you're looking for?

05:13.605 --> 05:14.902
Tell me where she is.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.112
It could save
a lot of bloodshed.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.781
Not yours.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.569
Oh, my God,
it reeks in here.

06:01.945 --> 06:02.946
Sorry I'm late.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.497
I had to make sure there
were only three of them.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.416
There are two more?
There were.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.286
They took Diana.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.912
Yeah, I figured.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.418
We're gonna
need fingerprints.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.066
I'll get the other two
on the way out.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.480
This is gonna get ugly.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.045
I missed you,
too, sweetie.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.032
I missed you, too.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.326
Let me look at you.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.447
So grown up.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.661
You look
so pretty, Mommy.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.080
Thank you. So do you.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.832
Are you coming with us?

06:54.122 --> 06:55.499
I'm trying.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.001
You have to
come with us.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.588
Your mommy can't come with us
just yet, but hopefully soon.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.298
I want her to come now.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.680
Honey, Mommy just has to do
a couple of things first.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.523
Honey.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.697
Honey, it's okay.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.823
Honey.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.029
Would you do something?

07:26.863 --> 07:29.286
Diana, look at me.
I'm right here.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.667
I just need
a little more time.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.260
Okay.

08:14.285 --> 08:18.506
Thanks for helping with the dishes,
and the pots and the pans.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.630
After a meal that good,
I'd clean your whole house.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.678
Oh, where do you
wanna start?

08:24.254 --> 08:27.508
I guess you haven't had
very many home-cooked meals.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.967
Well, I can defrost.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.931
I can fry water.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.513
Well, you can have all the
leftovers if you want.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.980
I want.

08:36.349 --> 08:40.024
Or maybe next time I can make you
some Camarones Veracruzanos.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.897
I don't know what
that is, but I'm in.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.779
So...

08:52.115 --> 08:53.116
So...

09:07.589 --> 09:08.681
Okay.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.175
Good?

09:11.217 --> 09:12.639
I miss Mommy.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.314
I know you do.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.857
And she misses you, too.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.775
You know that, don't you?

09:24.481 --> 09:26.358
I hope that she
joins us very soon.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.444
Okay.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.780
You need to get
some sleep.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.658
I love you.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.748
Good night.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.056
Sean Renard.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.693
I'm Conrad Bonaparte.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.861
I was told we were
gonna meet tomorrow.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.649
I heard what happened
with Diana and Adalind.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.986
We can't afford for Adalind to
make the wrong choice, huh?

10:12.487 --> 10:13.830
It's her decision.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.041
Well, she should
certainly believe it is.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.248
She is a Hexenbiest.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.704
All the more reason
she should be with us.

10:22.747 --> 10:26.251
If she chooses the Grimm,
we will have to kill her.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.883
Well, you may not want to
mention that to Diana.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.885
Your daughter is extremely
valuable to all of us.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.013
She's young, so she won't
understand everything,

10:39.055 --> 10:41.979
but she will trust
her mother and father.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.944
But you need to be together
for that to happen.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.771
Which brings me
to the Grimm.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.399
What about him?

10:50.525 --> 10:51.822
You work together.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.824
You have a relationship
with him, no?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.450
Well, that's not
gonna last very long

10:55.530 --> 10:56.702
if Adalind comes with me.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.660
Not if you convince him that
he should be on our side.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.039
Why would he align
himself with Black Claw?

11:05.456 --> 11:07.550
Because he's
part of our world.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.387
Because we have
a place for him.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.351
Because there is
no other choice.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.306
Mommy?

11:25.310 --> 11:26.687
Mommy.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.359
Where are you?

11:33.151 --> 11:34.494
I'm right here, honey.
Where are you?

11:34.569 --> 11:35.570
Right here.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.071
Diana?

11:38.114 --> 11:39.286
Come back.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.834
It's okay, buddy.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.388
Kelly was hungry.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.590
Didn't mean
to wake you.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.142
Everything okay?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.390
Uh, yeah.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.937
I just didn't see him
in the crib

12:01.012 --> 12:02.138
and got scared.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.149
on...

12:08.394 --> 12:09.737
I'm sorry.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.541
Nick, we need to talk.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.039
Okay.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.582
Is there a problem?

12:29.832 --> 12:30.833
Yeah.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.596
It's sort of
a communication problem.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.363
You knew, didn't you?

12:57.527 --> 12:59.154
I should have
told you sooner.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.451
Why are you
telling me now?

13:02.198 --> 13:03.620
I wanted to.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.369
I tried. I really did.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.046
I just got too scared.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.048
I told you I would
never hurt you.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.217
People change
their mind, Nick.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.721
I lost my mom
when I was 12.

13:22.719 --> 13:26.565
Then I got her back,
and I lost her again.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.068
I would never
do that to Kelly.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.402
And I
would never hurt you.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.158
I'm just worried the world's
never gonna leave us alone.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.211
Uh, I was just checking
his heart rate.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.008
I thought that the monitor
wasn't working right.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.381
I can't explain it.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.758
I don't know what I saw,
but it wasn't normal.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.846
Oh, my God.
It got out, it got out.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.316
Oh. Uh...

14:52.975 --> 14:54.477
I just had to use
the rest room.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.274
Is everything okay?

14:58.523 --> 14:59.524
Uh...

15:00.483 --> 15:01.609
Morning.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.092
Are you really
okay with this?

15:03.486 --> 15:04.658
What?

15:04.821 --> 15:07.449
Waking up with a smart,
beautiful, amazing woman?

15:07.657 --> 15:09.000
You know what I mean.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.250
Hmm.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.838
You're Wesen,
I'm not.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.541
Don't hold it
against me.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.917
I don't.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.844
I'm sorry that
I did before.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.796
Some things take
a little time.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.140
Well, part of it
was your friend.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.341
Nick?

15:25.425 --> 15:26.972
Yeah, he's a Grimm.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.769
We're not exactly
taught to trust them.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.639
Does he know what's
going on between us?

15:31.973 --> 15:33.099
He does.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.646
You worried about him?

15:35.059 --> 15:36.151
Should I be?

15:36.561 --> 15:37.608
No.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.357
He has no reason
to hurt you.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.277
Unless, of course,
you hurt me.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.617
Uh-huh. So you're
saying I'm stuck?

15:46.696 --> 15:48.494
Apparently, you are.

15:51.242 --> 15:54.371
So, what's it like working with
a Grimm and knowing all this?

15:54.871 --> 15:55.872
Hmm.

15:57.039 --> 16:02.637
It's, uh, sort of like chasing
Alice down the rabbit hole.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.882
Well, I'd like to
get a more normal

16:05.965 --> 16:07.012
introduction to Nick.

16:07.717 --> 16:08.718
Sure.

16:11.804 --> 16:12.805
Are you hungry?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.516
I'm starving, yeah.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.646
I'll make us something.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.068
No, no, no.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.902
You made dinner,
I'll make breakfast.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.403
Mmm.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.324
...and it
looks to be a tight mayoral race

16:27.403 --> 16:29.405
here in Portland
between Steven Gallagher

16:29.489 --> 16:32.413
and recent candidate
Police Captain Sean Renard.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.210
Your CAT scan
came back clear,

16:34.285 --> 16:35.537
But your
body temperature

16:35.620 --> 16:37.420
and your blood pressure
are lower than normal.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.007
Isn't that a good thing?

16:40.082 --> 16:41.082
Not necessarily.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.299
It appears there are
antibodies to Rh+ blood.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.221
But your blood is O.

16:46.297 --> 16:49.847
And without ever having had a
transfusion, it's a medical anomaly.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.178
So you can't
explain it.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.260
Not really.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.543
But it doesn't
seem to be having

16:53.596 --> 16:54.956
any adverse effects
on your health,

16:54.972 --> 16:56.690
and you've been
stable for 24 hours,

16:56.766 --> 16:58.439
so we think
you're good to go home.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.940
When?
Now.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.145
But you need
to be careful.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.948
If you feel lightheaded, it's probably
a good idea to check back in.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.069
And we'll take him home.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.242
Get me out of here.
I'm starving.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.574
Thanks, Doc.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.201
I really appreciate this.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.656
Hey, we're here
for you.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.871
We are here
for him, right?

17:14.951 --> 17:17.545
Yeah, most of the time. I
mean, we paid for the burger.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.714
And the fries.
Don't forget the fries.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.462
You guys are awesome.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.719
Ooh! That sounded insincere.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.011
No, I think
he meant it.

17:28.506 --> 17:29.974
Man, you inhaled that.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.177
I have been dreaming
of red meat.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.308
Speaking of dreams...

17:37.306 --> 17:39.229
I'm having some really
weird ones lately.

17:39.892 --> 17:40.893
Weirder than
red meat?

17:40.977 --> 17:41.978
Oh, yeah.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.694
I'm running
through a forest, hunting.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.618
Very real.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.987
And sort of primal.
Animalistic.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.993
You did slam your
head pretty good.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.538
Uh... No, this is before
I hit my head.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.170
I don't know.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.864
Maybe I've just been spending
too much time with Wesen.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.249
Tell me about it.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.334
Look, if you keep
having these dreams,

18:06.419 --> 18:07.796
just make sure
to call Rosalee.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.755
I'm sure she has something that
can make you sleep better.

18:09.839 --> 18:10.840
Yeah, okay.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.845
Look, uh, I'm just gonna get
changed, and I'm coming back in.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.770
Oh, no.
You're staying home.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.519
Will you please
take the day off?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.101
I mean, Portland will survive
one day without you.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.183
And what if it doesn't?

18:22.226 --> 18:23.819
Then we'll know
who to blame.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.026
Just get some rest.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.445
Oh, you have to schedule this
deposition sooner rather than later.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.648
We have a court date, they
can't keep postponing this.

18:35.656 --> 18:36.873
Mommy.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.423
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

18:46.709 --> 18:47.881
Mommy?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.137
Diana?

18:54.216 --> 18:55.513
Where are you?

19:03.684 --> 19:05.357
Where are you?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.113
I'm waiting for you.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.241
Mommy, I want you
to come home now.

19:11.859 --> 19:12.906
Now.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.278
No, Diana.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.252
Mommy, Mommy.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.667
I'm waiting.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.252
Where are you?

19:25.665 --> 19:26.917
Where are you?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.427
You're not my mommy.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.156
You're back.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.833
Black Claw found
the safe house.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.002
Killed the guardians.
They have Diana.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.704
They brought Diana here
for Adalind.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.205
How do you know?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.208
I think I just
connected with her.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.975
She did that?
Yeah.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.552
And I saw her.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.012
Okay.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.933
How did that happen?

20:25.307 --> 20:26.307
I don't know.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.354
It must have something to do with
Adalind turning into Juliette,

20:29.437 --> 20:30.984
and then Juliette
turning into Adalind.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.982
So you sort of got
your wires crossed.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.575
Something like that.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.323
This little girl
has a lot of power.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.746
I just felt some of it,
and it felt like

20:38.821 --> 20:41.074
grabbing hold of
a lightning bolt.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.034
You think Diana's
reaching out to Adalind?

20:43.117 --> 20:44.619
More like demanding.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.084
We got to tell Nick.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.095
This is an opportunity
for me to show what I stand for.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.265
And for all of us here
to achieve

20:57.339 --> 20:59.512
what we want for
the future of Portland.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.628
I know what
we are capable of.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.264
The drive and the will
of every citizen of Portland

21:05.347 --> 21:08.146
is evident to us all
except for my opponent.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.398
Who would put the needs
of the corporations

21:10.478 --> 21:12.572
ahead of the needs
of the people in the city.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.783
Now, I'm not just spinning
out baseless accusations.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.577
Take a look at my opponent's
record as city councilman

21:18.652 --> 21:20.029
and you'll see for yourself.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.707
Speech after speech of empty
promises and stale ideas.

21:25.242 --> 21:28.086
I came to Portland because this
is a small town with a big deal.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.460
Damn it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

21:30.539 --> 21:32.416
But if my opponent
had his way, well,

21:32.500 --> 21:35.219
the Portland that you and I have
come to love would be pushed aside.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.134
Please take a look
at my records

21:38.214 --> 21:39.966
as the Captain of the
Portland Police Department.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.050
You can see for
yourself that...

21:47.348 --> 21:49.066
- politician that Mr. Gallagher showed.
- Not again.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.361
The first time in office,
the status quo.

21:54.063 --> 21:57.863
I promise you that I will
make this Rose City...

22:06.826 --> 22:08.328
- Hey, Burkhardt.
- Nick, it's me.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.667
Trubel? Where are you?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.248
We just got back
to Portland.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.332
You and Meisner?

22:13.415 --> 22:14.382
Yeah. Look we need to talk.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.176
Not on the phone.
And bring Hank, too.

22:16.377 --> 22:17.674
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.673
What was that about?

22:20.756 --> 22:23.475
Trubel and Meisner are back.
They need to see us.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.428
Then this chair is
not where I wanna be.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.148
Thanks again, Mrs. Sacks.
Bye.

22:30.891 --> 22:31.892
Thank you.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.189
Spice & Tea.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.445
Rosalee, uh, it's Wu.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.571
Wu.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.323
How you feeling?
You out of the hospital?

22:41.402 --> 22:44.622
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'm feeling okay, but...

22:46.448 --> 22:50.078
I kinda got some strange stuff going on.
Can't really figure it out.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.336
You wanna
come by the shop?

22:51.412 --> 22:52.459
Yeah, I do.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.327
How long
you gonna be there?

22:54.373 --> 22:55.374
We'll wait for you.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.674
Okay, thank you.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.588
Who are we waiting for?
Wu.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.928
He's out of the hospital?
Apparently.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.054
Something's
bothering him though.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.806
So, he wants to come by and
see if we can help him out.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.136
Huh. Well...

23:07.595 --> 23:08.596
If it's anything serious,

23:08.679 --> 23:10.799
they wouldn't have let him
out of the hospital, right?

23:15.936 --> 23:16.983
Oh, come on in.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.570
Adalind, I'd like you
to meet Conrad Bonaparte.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.777
A very important client.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.658
Conrad, Adalind Schade.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.830
Nice to meet you.
You too.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.125
He has a private
matter to discuss with you.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.439
I'll let you two
get acquainted.

23:30.576 --> 23:31.577
Thank you.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.129
Ah!

23:35.372 --> 23:39.627
I think it's great that you bring
your son into the office like this.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.298
I lost both my parents
at a young age.

23:43.881 --> 23:47.431
So,  you should spend
all the time you can with him.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.104
I do. This is...
Kelly.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.811
Did Mr. Berman tell you?

23:56.226 --> 24:00.231
There's a word for when you lose
your parents, it's "orphan."

24:01.982 --> 24:04.576
And there is a word for
when you lose a spouse,

24:04.652 --> 24:06.495
it's "widow" or "widower."

24:09.073 --> 24:12.828
There are many words
for many things.

24:14.578 --> 24:18.299
But there is no word for
when you lose a child.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.044
What do you want?

24:24.254 --> 24:27.975
Your present relationship is very
unhealthy for you and Kelly.

24:29.635 --> 24:32.684
Your future is with us.
Not with the Grimm.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.686
You need to make a decision
by the end of the day.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.235
Hmm?

25:23.522 --> 25:24.648
Theo Delano.

25:26.734 --> 25:27.951
Why are you
following me?

25:28.027 --> 25:29.153
I'm not following you.

25:29.236 --> 25:32.076
Then why sit outside my apartment all day?
You got nothing better to do?

25:33.365 --> 25:36.118
I'm gonna go back to that truck of
yours, and I'm gonna impound it.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.953
You can't do that.
Oh, yes, I can.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.790
I've arrested you three times. I see
your presence here as a threat.

25:41.707 --> 25:42.708
Maybe you're right.

25:54.011 --> 25:55.263
Black Claw has Diana.

25:55.929 --> 25:57.852
We're pretty sure they brought
her here to Portland.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.729
To get to Adalind. And you.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.019
Now that she's a Hexenbiest
again, she's valuable.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.233
And she's vulnerable.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.861
A Hexenbiest, a
Zauberbiest, and their kid.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.065
It's pretty intense.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.401
No, Adalind will
never leave Kelly.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.202
That doesn't mean
she won't take him.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.904
I'm not gonna lose
my son.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.830
We find Diana,
we stop it now.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.791
Griffin.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.911
Okay, where?

26:20.162 --> 26:21.209
Be there in 20.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.123
Got a body.

26:23.499 --> 26:24.716
We have to move on this.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.792
The information we have
is gonna get old very fast.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.096
Do it. Do whatever
you have to do.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.052
Burkhardt.

26:34.510 --> 26:37.138
I will do everything
I can to keep Kelly safe.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.765
But don't trust Adalind.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.313
She may no longer
be in control.

26:49.233 --> 26:50.234
What do you got?

26:50.317 --> 26:52.445
Victim, male, a lot of blood.
Wound on his neck.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.451
And by wound,
I mean someone chewed

26:54.530 --> 26:56.828
his jugular up with
a chain saw. Fun stuff.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.325
Got an ID on the vic?

26:58.408 --> 27:00.911
Didn't need to. Everyone
knows this jug head.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.543
We've all had the pleasure.
Theo Delano.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.458
He's got a rap sheet
10 miles long,

27:05.541 --> 27:06.963
three miles wide,
six feet deep.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.294
Any witnesses?

27:08.377 --> 27:10.017
None that
have come forward.

27:10.754 --> 27:11.971
Rosalee.
Nick.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.845
- Is Wu with you?
- No. Why?

27:14.925 --> 27:16.017
I'm a little
worried about him.

27:16.093 --> 27:17.185
Yeah, we both are.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.986
- What's wrong?
- He called earlier,

27:19.012 --> 27:21.185
saying he had a problem, and
that he was coming right over.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.939
But he never showed up. We
were hoping he was with you.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.644
No, we were
with him earlier today,

27:25.727 --> 27:27.229
we dropped him off
at his apartment.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.564
What time did he call you?

27:28.647 --> 27:29.739
Couple hours ago.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.443
All right, well, we're right around
the corner, we'll go check on him.

27:32.526 --> 27:33.573
Let us know how he is.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.289
We got a problem?
We got to go check on Wu.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.411
What happened?

27:38.490 --> 27:39.582
He called Rosalee,

27:39.658 --> 27:41.251
said he was gonna come over
and never showed up.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.543
Maybe he just
fell asleep.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.125
We'll wake him up then.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.297
Give us 10.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.599
Wu?
We're coming in.

28:03.849 --> 28:04.896
Wu?

28:07.144 --> 28:08.191
Wu!

28:10.105 --> 28:11.106
Oh, God.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.031
He's still breathing.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.202
You see
any wounds on him?

28:17.112 --> 28:18.113
No.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.532
Wu.

28:21.575 --> 28:22.576
Wu.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.751
What happened?

28:27.247 --> 28:28.294
What do you mean?

28:28.749 --> 28:30.376
Wu, there's
blood everywhere.

28:32.753 --> 28:33.754
Oh, my God.

28:44.514 --> 28:45.561
What happened?

28:49.478 --> 28:51.025
I was on my way
to see Rosalee.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.148
Um...

28:54.149 --> 28:55.150
God, I don't know.

28:57.361 --> 28:58.783
Someone must
have attacked me.

29:00.656 --> 29:01.908
Oh, God, my head hurts.

29:01.990 --> 29:02.991
Where were you attacked?

29:05.327 --> 29:06.328
Um...

29:07.829 --> 29:10.048
I was on my way to my car
when it happened.

29:11.458 --> 29:14.052
I saw something.
That's what stopped me.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.548
What did I see?
Wait a minute.

29:18.674 --> 29:19.926
Theo Delano.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.395
He was parked
in a truck outside all day.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.772
Theo Delano?

29:25.847 --> 29:29.192
Yeah. I've arrested him
a few times. A real nitwit.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.564
Okay, sol...

29:36.108 --> 29:37.155
I kept walking,

29:37.234 --> 29:40.454
past his truck, see if
he was gonna follow me.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.702
He did,
then I confronted him.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.329
What happened next?

29:47.494 --> 29:48.495
He Woged.

29:49.079 --> 29:52.208
That's right, he Woged.
And then he attacked me.

29:52.666 --> 29:53.838
What was he?

29:55.043 --> 29:56.761
Skalengeck, I think.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.799
Are you sure
it was Theo Delano?

29:59.881 --> 30:02.475
Oh, I'm sure.
You don't forget a guy

30:02.551 --> 30:04.311
who throws up in the
back of your patrol car.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.766
We just saw his body.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.436
What? Crime scene's
around the corner.

30:11.810 --> 30:12.811
Oh, my God.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.403
Did I kill him?

30:20.027 --> 30:21.574
Do you think
you killed him?

30:23.947 --> 30:25.244
Oh, God, I have no idea.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.248
Is this his blood on me?
We don't know.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.417
Might be.
Oh, God...

30:33.290 --> 30:35.090
- You're here to arrest me.
- No, we're not.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.920
If he attacked you
like you said,

30:39.629 --> 30:41.677
then it was all
in self-defense.

30:44.926 --> 30:47.645
How did he die?
Did I shoot him?

30:49.222 --> 30:50.269
His throat
was ripped out.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.644
What? You have to
go get cleaned up.

30:53.727 --> 30:56.025
Yeah, but you're gonna need
my clothes as evidence.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.106
Yeah, he's a Skalengeck.
He followed you.

30:59.149 --> 31:01.151
This was not an accident.
You were being watched.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.369
Now you just come with us
to the crime scene,

31:03.820 --> 31:05.572
just to make sure
it's the same guy.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.703
Hey.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.210
Drew, how you feeling? Heard
you got banged up pretty good.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.297
Ah! I'm okay.

31:18.043 --> 31:20.363
I was gonna come by the hospital
but you were already gone.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.096
It's good to
have you back.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.012
Theo“.

31:25.092 --> 31:26.093
Yeah, it's Theo.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.637
Not many tears are gonna
be shed over this hombre.

31:31.348 --> 31:32.895
Are you guys ready
to let CSU have it?

31:32.974 --> 31:33.975
Yeah, let 'em have it.

31:37.354 --> 31:38.554
This the guy
that attacked you?

31:39.147 --> 31:40.899
Yeah, that's him.

31:41.316 --> 31:42.676
You said he was
sitting in a truck?

31:42.818 --> 31:43.819
Yeah, uh...

31:44.653 --> 31:45.779
It was around the corner.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.114
Show us.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.791
He was sitting
in it all day.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.504
That's a lot of fast food.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.007
He's definitely
been here a while.

32:02.212 --> 32:03.384
He's got your address.

32:03.463 --> 32:04.589
Why was he watching me?

32:05.674 --> 32:08.177
It's not like I'm the only
cop who's ever arrested him.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.683
He could be
with Black Claw.

32:10.887 --> 32:13.140
I'm texting Trubel to see if
Delano's in their database.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.838
So, you were going to see Rosalee
because of those dreams?

32:16.351 --> 32:18.024
I think they're more
than just dreams.

32:19.229 --> 32:20.776
I think something's
happening to me.

32:22.566 --> 32:24.785
We're taking you
to the Spice Shop.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.662
Hey.
Just wondering

32:31.741 --> 32:33.038
if you're coming
over tonight.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.370
If you don't
mind it being late.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.293
Late is fine.
Look forward to it.

32:43.879 --> 32:44.926
He'll be here.

32:45.922 --> 32:46.923
Good.

32:49.634 --> 32:53.229
I can't take you away from your dad.
I can't do that.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.058
But I cann't lose
Diana again, either.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.272
I can feel how badly
she needs me.

33:07.569 --> 33:08.912
Sean.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.547
You've run out
of time, Ada/ind.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.411
Sean, please...

33:13.408 --> 33:15.410
We need an answer. Now.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.586
Sean...

33:28.131 --> 33:31.601
So I'm running through
the forest, hunting.

33:33.929 --> 33:35.556
It feels very primal.

33:36.765 --> 33:39.439
It's like they're not dreams.
I'm living them.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.279
What if I did
kill Delano?

33:44.064 --> 33:45.864
Now, how did you do it?
His neck was shredded.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.410
I can't remember.

33:51.071 --> 33:54.621
It's like I saw him coming at
me and then I blacked out.

33:56.159 --> 33:57.519
I'm trying to remember
but I can't.

33:57.911 --> 33:59.413
Some Revocare Tenebris.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.627
Might work.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.707
Some what now?

34:02.791 --> 34:04.134
Revocare Tenebris.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.257
It translates to,
"Recall the darkness."

34:06.920 --> 34:08.120
It stimulates
your hippocampus.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.507
We've got some. It might
help you to remember.

34:11.675 --> 34:12.801
I'll go get it.

34:12.884 --> 34:13.976
What are
the side-effects?

34:14.052 --> 34:17.147
You remember the stuff your brain
spent a lot of time burying

34:17.222 --> 34:19.565
in the deepest, darkest
recesses of your mind.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.141
Oh.

34:24.478 --> 34:25.759
One teaspoon
should do the trick.

34:36.783 --> 34:37.955
Drink this
as fast as you can,

34:38.034 --> 34:39.831
you want the effect
to come all at once.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.879
What if this isn't the only
time I've killed someone?

34:41.955 --> 34:44.594
The best thing you can do is calm down.
We'll get you through this.

34:47.835 --> 34:48.837
Okay.

34:52.591 --> 34:53.842
Here's to the memories.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.191
It's gonna knock you out.
You should lie down.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.777
I hope this doesn't
go back too far.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.829
There are few things I did as a
teenager that I'd rather not...

35:17.115 --> 35:18.162
Rather not...

35:21.620 --> 35:23.122
When is he supposed
to wake up?

35:23.204 --> 35:24.547
We want him
to stay asleep.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.796
He needs to be able to
access his memories

35:26.875 --> 35:29.594
without any outside stimulation
causing them to go away again.

35:29.669 --> 35:33.139
Yeah, yeah, bad memories are
like, you know little bunnies.

35:33.214 --> 35:34.807
They get scared, they
run back down the hole,

35:34.883 --> 35:36.763
they hide, they can be a
bitch to get out again.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.060
Bunnies?

35:38.136 --> 35:41.731
Revocare Tenebris has Somniloquy in it.
It induces sleep talking.

35:47.729 --> 35:48.730
Theo Delano...

35:49.230 --> 35:50.231
He's accessing.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.574
Theo Delano.
Theo Delano...

35:56.237 --> 35:57.705
Why are you
following me?

35:57.781 --> 35:58.907
I'm not following you.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.331
Then why sit outside my apartment all day?
You got nothing better to do?

36:05.246 --> 36:06.748
He starts to
walk away from me.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.266
I'm gonna go back to that truck of
yours and I'm gonna impound it.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.097
He stops. He's angry.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.100
You can't do that.
Oh, yes, I can.

36:18.134 --> 36:21.138
I've arrested you three times. I see
your presence here as a threat.

36:21.596 --> 36:22.597
Maybe you're right.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.182
Then he Woged.

36:25.475 --> 36:26.476
And came at me.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.413
I dug my fingers
into his throat.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.450
I could feel the warm
blood on my hand.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.297
What's happening?

36:51.376 --> 36:53.845
I'm not sure, I've never seen
anything like this before.

36:53.920 --> 36:54.921
We should record this.

36:56.464 --> 36:57.465
I killed him.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.301
It felt good.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.062
Is Wu a Wesen?

37:11.312 --> 37:12.564
Uh-uh.
This ain't Wesen.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.900
Can somebody please explain
to me what just happened?

37:14.983 --> 37:16.543
I don't know,
but I think he was bitten.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.786
Bitten? By who?

37:19.154 --> 37:20.155
Bitten by Theo?

37:20.363 --> 37:21.410
This has nothing
to do with Theo.

37:21.489 --> 37:22.581
This reminds me
of what can happen

37:22.657 --> 37:23.704
with Lycanthropia.

37:23.783 --> 37:24.823
No, but that's impossible.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.248
Lycanthropia only
affects Blutbad.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.586
Well, there hasn't
been a lot of research on it,

37:27.662 --> 37:28.709
for obvious reasons,

37:28.788 --> 37:31.041
but I remember reading
that the genetic mutation

37:31.124 --> 37:33.923
passed down in Blutbaden was
caused by a viral infection.

37:34.002 --> 37:37.097
So you think that Wu might
have caught this virus?

37:37.464 --> 37:38.636
If he was scratched
or bitten.

37:38.715 --> 37:39.841
Wait a minute.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.435
He was attacked
by that Lycanthrope,

37:42.510 --> 37:43.682
you guys, remember?

37:44.012 --> 37:45.012
Then it is possible.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.174
And, he is... Somehow, he's
manifesting it differently

37:47.182 --> 37:48.502
than he would
if he was a Blutbad.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.517
Oh, my God.

37:49.851 --> 37:51.023
I think we have
a problem.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.234
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God,

37:53.313 --> 37:54.553
I just remembered,
I killed him.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.367
Didn't I? I killed him,
I killed Delano.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.076
Yeah. You did.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.449
Oh, my God,
how did that happen?

38:01.362 --> 38:02.454
How?

38:04.032 --> 38:05.500
Well... Um...

38:07.118 --> 38:08.210
Like this.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.291
I killed him.

38:17.921 --> 38:19.013
It felt good.

38:21.716 --> 38:22.763
What happened to me?

38:24.469 --> 38:25.595
What am I?

38:25.678 --> 38:28.181
Do you remember being
attacked by the Lycanthrope?

38:35.438 --> 38:36.485
Yeah, why?

38:36.981 --> 38:38.233
Were you bit or scratched?

38:45.114 --> 38:46.161
Yeah.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.838
Does it mean
I'm Wesen now?

38:51.913 --> 38:53.415
No, no,
you're not Wesen.

38:54.541 --> 38:55.588
Then how does
this happen?

38:55.917 --> 38:59.967
My guess is it's an emotional response.
Sort of a fight or flight.

39:00.213 --> 39:03.763
Yeah. Like you're going into full-on
survival mode or something.

39:05.009 --> 39:08.604
Which could be causing the
blackouts and the physical change.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.432
How do I stop it?

39:11.641 --> 39:13.484
I don't know.

39:14.561 --> 39:16.029
But we'll
try to find something.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.276
But for right now,

39:18.398 --> 39:21.072
you just need to stay calm until we
can figure out what's going on here.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.948
Maybe for tonight
you need to stay with us.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.240
Just until we can
get a handle on this.

39:29.450 --> 39:30.451
I appreciate that.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.673
But it's not your
responsibility, it's mine.

39:35.498 --> 39:39.002
It's up to me to control it,
and I'd better start now.

39:40.461 --> 39:41.462
Are you sure?

39:41.963 --> 39:43.510
As long as I know
I'm not crazy,

39:43.590 --> 39:45.092
I'll find a way
to deal with it.

39:50.346 --> 39:51.723
Trubel, you find
anything out?

39:51.806 --> 39:53.228
Yeah, he's in
the system.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.228
Theodore Delano.
Born in Fresno, California.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.063
Affiliated with
several Wesen gangs.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.989
Wanted for assault
and parole violation.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.237
I can go on, but basically
he's a Skalengeck

40:02.317 --> 40:04.115
who joined Black Claw
six months ago.

40:04.193 --> 40:05.319
Any known associates?

40:05.403 --> 40:06.871
Easier to
send you the list.

40:06.946 --> 40:07.947
Thanks.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.323
And where's
Theo Delano now?

40:12.493 --> 40:13.915
Dead.
Oh, good.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.338
I'll update the database.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.505
Is that Nick?

40:16.581 --> 40:17.582
Yeah.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.668
Nick. Are you
with Adalind?

40:20.043 --> 40:21.795
No. Something is
happening with her.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.095
I think you need
to go home.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.172
Okay.

40:24.547 --> 40:26.345
I got to go.
I'll come with you.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.801
No. I'll keep you posted.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.521
So, Theo was Black Claw.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.098
We all need to start
watching our backs.

40:49.822 --> 40:50.914
Hey.
You made it.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.037
Yeah.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.459
How was your day?

41:01.542 --> 41:02.589
Long.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.045
And weird.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.348
I missed you.
Is that weird?

41:07.423 --> 41:09.892
No. Anything but.

41:17.433 --> 41:18.434
Adalind!

41:51.592 --> 41:53.272
"I'm doing
something I have to do.

41:54.220 --> 41:56.439
"I don't expect you to ever
understand what I've done,

41:57.181 --> 41:59.229
"but it's the only way
to protect my children.

42:00.476 --> 42:05.698
"And I don't expect you to believe
this, but I love you. I'm sorry."
