02:02.782 --> 02:04.583
<i>I never imagined myself</i>

02:04.617 --> 02:07.921
<i>as someone suited to a life
of incarceration.</i>

02:07.955 --> 02:10.958
<i>As a boy, I was afraid
of confined spaces.</i>

02:10.991 --> 02:13.093
<i>I feared elevators.</i>

02:13.126 --> 02:15.896
<i>When I was old enough, I just
wanted to get in the car,</i>

02:15.929 --> 02:18.731
<i>roll the windows
and drive, drive...</i>

02:18.764 --> 02:22.635
<i>drive wherever my eyes
would take me.</i>

02:22.668 --> 02:24.637
<i>I was an American kid.</i>

02:24.670 --> 02:28.507
<i>Confinement of any kind
was terrifying to me.</i>

02:28.541 --> 02:31.011
<i>So, to my surprise,
having been sentenced</i>

02:31.044 --> 02:34.114
<i>to ten years in prison,</i>

02:34.147 --> 02:36.749
<i>I found I adjusted quite well.</i>

02:44.824 --> 02:48.561
Section Seven,
full lockdown, 800 hours.

03:03.110 --> 03:05.711
<i>I liked the routine.</i>

03:05.745 --> 03:07.580
<i>I liked the regimen.</i>

03:07.613 --> 03:11.018
<i>Same activities,
same time, every day.</i>

03:11.051 --> 03:14.820
<i>The same toothbrush,
the same clothes, same toilet.</i>

03:14.855 --> 03:18.557
<i>Same stale sweat, stale smoke,</i>

03:18.591 --> 03:21.928
<i>stale bodies,
stale cooking, stale farts.</i>

03:21.962 --> 03:23.930
<i>Same conversations.</i>

03:23.964 --> 03:25.999
<i>The faces change but not much.</i>

03:26.033 --> 03:27.633
<i>No choice.</i>

03:27.666 --> 03:29.602
<i>I found that I liked
reading books.</i>

03:29.635 --> 03:32.906
<i>I'd never read a book before...
not all the way through.</i>

03:34.941 --> 03:38.811
<i>I found a life for myself that
had been beyond my imagination.</i>

03:41.647 --> 03:44.084
<i>It was in prison
I learned to count cards.</i>

03:50.090 --> 03:52.591
<i>What separates blackjack
from other games</i>

03:52.625 --> 03:55.162
<i>is that it's based on
dependent events,</i>

03:55.195 --> 03:58.999
<i>meaning past affects
the probability in the future.</i>

03:59.032 --> 04:01.968
<i>The house has a 1.5% advantage.</i>

04:03.403 --> 04:05.704
<i>If a player knows the nature
of the cards in the shoe,</i>

04:05.738 --> 04:07.974
<i>he can turn the house advantage
to himself.</i>

04:10.110 --> 04:11.677
<i>To do this, he has to</i>

04:11.710 --> 04:13.779
<i>keep track of every card
that is played.</i>

04:14.848 --> 04:17.117
<i>Count is based on
a high/low system.</i>

04:17.149 --> 04:19.853
<i>High cards...
ten, jack, queen, king...</i>

04:19.886 --> 04:21.922
<i>have a value of minus-one.</i>

04:23.123 --> 04:25.892
<i>If they are depleted,
player's advantage goes down.</i>

04:27.060 --> 04:29.695
<i>The low cards...
two, three, four, five, six...</i>

04:29.728 --> 04:31.764
<i>have a value of plus-one.</i>

04:34.667 --> 04:37.838
<i>The seven, eight and nine
have no count value.</i>

04:37.871 --> 04:39.705
<i>The player keeps track
of every card</i>

04:39.738 --> 04:42.209
<i>and calculates
the running count.</i>

04:42.242 --> 04:44.244
<i>Then the player arrives
at the true count,</i>

04:44.277 --> 04:47.114
<i>which is the running count
divided by the decks remaining.</i>

04:47.147 --> 04:49.216
<i>For example, if the
running count is plus-nine</i>

04:49.249 --> 04:51.784
<i>and there are four and a half
decks remaining,</i>

04:51.817 --> 04:55.021
<i>nine over four and a half gives
you a true count of plus-two.</i>

04:56.289 --> 04:57.991
<i>As true count increases,</i>

04:58.024 --> 05:00.127
<i>the player's advantage
increases.</i>

05:00.160 --> 05:03.997
<i>The idea is to bet little when
you don't have the advantage,</i>

05:04.030 --> 05:06.166
<i>more when you do.</i>

05:10.137 --> 05:12.172
Well, that's about
enough for me.

05:13.306 --> 05:15.708
- Hey, man, good to see you.
- Good playing with you.

05:17.911 --> 05:19.045
Again.

05:20.046 --> 05:21.982
How we doing?

05:23.782 --> 05:25.919
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

05:29.890 --> 05:31.291
And would you like large bills?

05:31.324 --> 05:33.059
Yes, please.

05:35.028 --> 05:38.031
That's one, two, three,
four, five, six,

05:38.064 --> 05:40.133
seven and 50.

05:40.167 --> 05:42.068
- That's $750.
- Thank you.

05:42.102 --> 05:44.471
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

06:41.361 --> 06:42.963
Good day.

06:42.996 --> 06:44.898
Good day to you, sir.

06:44.931 --> 06:48.101
I'd like a...
single, one night.

06:48.134 --> 06:50.070
I'll pay now. I have cash.

06:50.103 --> 06:52.738
- $56.
- All right.

06:54.941 --> 06:57.244
Checkout's at noon.

06:57.277 --> 06:59.346
Sign here.

06:59.379 --> 07:01.047
Would you like some coffee?

07:01.081 --> 07:02.983
How old is it?

07:03.016 --> 07:05.151
I made it this morning.

07:06.152 --> 07:07.187
I'm fine.

07:08.154 --> 07:09.556
- Room 101.
- Thank you.

07:09.589 --> 07:11.258
Mm-hmm.

09:52.252 --> 09:54.120
Mr. B.

09:54.154 --> 09:55.722
- Long time, no see.
- Hey.

09:55.755 --> 09:57.424
- Not so long, Slippery Joe.
- How you been?

09:57.457 --> 09:59.025
No, they don't call me that
no more.

09:59.058 --> 10:00.260
- Yeah?
- What are they calling you?

10:00.293 --> 10:01.494
Do you have a suggestion?

10:01.528 --> 10:03.163
You here for
the poker tournament?

10:03.196 --> 10:04.964
Yeah. I like grand openings.

10:04.998 --> 10:06.166
Reopenings. You know,
I don't know why they bother.

10:06.199 --> 10:07.434
Well, they're working
things out.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.068
Mistakes get made.
It always happens.

10:09.102 --> 10:11.037
They got a new
high-stakes pai gow room.

10:11.070 --> 10:12.439
Yeah, house odds 11%.

10:12.472 --> 10:14.307
Yeah, and plenty of suckers.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.376
I don't know. Those Asian
gamblers are pretty crafty.

10:16.409 --> 10:18.578
No, you j-just seem to think
of them that way, you know.

10:18.611 --> 10:20.180
What-what are you gonna play?

10:20.213 --> 10:21.581
I'm gonna play
a little blackjack.

10:21.614 --> 10:23.316
Oh, you know, there's some
great guys down here.

10:23.349 --> 10:25.318
- Downtown Brown...
- Ah, I-I've met enough people.

10:25.351 --> 10:28.188
No, you've got to meet 'em, man.
So, anyway, so...

10:28.221 --> 10:30.457
All right, you know what?
Let's just go to Washa Casino.

10:30.490 --> 10:32.158
It's 15 minutes away.

10:32.192 --> 10:33.426
We can sit in on the poker game.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.094
Ah, Slippery.

10:35.128 --> 10:36.763
Come on, Mr. B.

10:36.796 --> 10:38.465
We're going. We're going.

10:38.498 --> 10:40.366
You know what?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.469
This has been dead to me.

10:42.502 --> 10:44.437
You can...

10:44.471 --> 10:46.339
Kansas City's been
a bust for me anyway.

10:46.372 --> 10:49.108
- It's like, ever since I...
- Never played Kansas City.

10:54.147 --> 10:56.216
Washa Casino... where'd they get
a name like that?

10:56.249 --> 10:58.184
It's indigenous.

10:59.185 --> 11:01.187
Hmm.

11:01.221 --> 11:03.389
Well, where's all
the Indian shit?

11:03.423 --> 11:05.358
Jackpot.

11:10.263 --> 11:12.098
Shit.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.102
Shit!

11:16.135 --> 11:18.137
They're down to the final table.

11:20.573 --> 11:22.275
Mm.

11:25.144 --> 11:27.213
World fucking tournament.

11:27.247 --> 11:29.215
Kiss my balls.

11:29.249 --> 11:31.050
What's your problem, Slip?

11:31.084 --> 11:32.552
I ain't got no problem.

11:32.585 --> 11:35.321
USA! USA!

11:35.355 --> 11:38.391
Look at this asshole, Mr. USA.

11:38.424 --> 11:40.126
It's working for him.

11:40.159 --> 11:42.095
Yeah, and he's working it
for all it's worth.

11:43.129 --> 11:44.397
He was born in the Ukraine.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.266
You know he's got
his own website?

11:46.299 --> 11:48.501
I came all the way out here
for this shit.

11:52.138 --> 11:54.140
Where you on to next?

11:54.173 --> 11:57.176
Uh, there's a law enforcement
convention in Atlantic City.

11:57.210 --> 11:59.212
- GSC.
- Hmm.

11:59.245 --> 12:00.848
Yeah, cops are always good.

12:00.881 --> 12:02.348
They get a few drinks in 'em,

12:02.382 --> 12:03.616
they think nobody
can touch 'em.

12:03.650 --> 12:05.285
Shit.
I ever tell you about

12:05.318 --> 12:06.586
my brother Bobby
from Pascagoula?

12:06.619 --> 12:08.588
State trooper.

12:08.621 --> 12:11.558
- USA! USA!
- USA!

12:11.591 --> 12:14.527
<i>The man never saw
a day of service.</i>

12:14.561 --> 12:17.096
<i>I'd like to run that
red, white and blue flag</i>

12:17.130 --> 12:19.499
<i>straight through his mouth
and out his asshole.</i>

12:19.532 --> 12:22.201
But you just told
the story of his life.

12:22.235 --> 12:26.706
USA! USA! USA! USA!

12:26.739 --> 12:28.374
That's it, baby.

12:36.349 --> 12:38.318
May I join you?

12:38.351 --> 12:39.586
Be our guest.

12:39.619 --> 12:41.187
I recognize you.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.156
- We've played before.
- Yeah.

12:43.189 --> 12:45.425
You know, I'm gonna let you two
just... youngsters be.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.226
I'm gonna go play some dice.

12:47.260 --> 12:48.595
All right.

12:48.628 --> 12:51.431
- Three times.
- No, four times.

12:51.464 --> 12:53.132
Horseshoe Baltimore,

12:53.166 --> 12:55.468
Caesars Atlantic City, Foxwoods

12:55.501 --> 12:58.137
- and Harrah's Philly.
- That's right.

12:58.171 --> 13:00.473
You binked a gutshot straight
at Foxwoods.

13:00.506 --> 13:02.141
No explaining luck.

13:02.175 --> 13:03.343
Linda, right?

13:03.376 --> 13:04.912
La Linda.

13:04.945 --> 13:06.914
LL, like "Lucky Lady."

13:06.947 --> 13:08.214
Ah, okay.

13:08.247 --> 13:09.282
I've watched you play.

13:09.315 --> 13:10.416
You count cards, right?

13:10.450 --> 13:11.751
I'm not that smart.

13:11.784 --> 13:14.721
But you win,
so you count cards.

13:14.754 --> 13:17.624
How do you avoid
getting backed off?

13:17.657 --> 13:19.659
I've been backed off.

13:19.692 --> 13:22.161
Yet here you are.

13:23.529 --> 13:25.732
Yeah, well,
it's a matter of degree.

13:25.765 --> 13:28.267
The house doesn't mind players
who count cards.

13:28.301 --> 13:31.170
They don't even mind players
who count cards and win.

13:31.204 --> 13:33.773
Oh, I'll have a Tom Collins
with Tanqueray.

13:33.806 --> 13:36.342
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Soda water, please.

13:36.376 --> 13:40.546
What they don't like are players
who count cards and win big.

13:40.580 --> 13:43.449
It's about how much you win
and how you win it.

13:43.483 --> 13:46.252
I stick to modest goals.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.421
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

13:48.454 --> 13:50.289
What's your name again?

13:50.323 --> 13:52.158
William Tell.

13:52.825 --> 13:54.694
I've watched you play poker,

13:54.727 --> 13:56.763
and I wonder why you play
at such low stakes.

13:56.796 --> 13:58.331
You're a crackerjack.

13:58.364 --> 14:00.400
I keep to modest goals.

14:00.433 --> 14:01.701
No, there's no reason for that.

14:01.734 --> 14:04.437
You can get someone
to stake you... an MTT...

14:04.470 --> 14:06.539
make seven million payout.

14:06.572 --> 14:09.242
That's what you do...
you-you run a stable.

14:09.275 --> 14:11.678
I'm always looking
for a good thoroughbred.

14:11.711 --> 14:15.181
I can get someone
to back you 100%, on my word.

14:16.349 --> 14:18.451
I prefer to work
under the radar.

14:19.452 --> 14:21.187
I thought you were a gambler.

14:24.457 --> 14:26.526
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:27.493 --> 14:29.462
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

14:29.495 --> 14:32.265
So, Bill...

14:32.298 --> 14:34.267
you ever been to prison?

14:37.470 --> 14:39.305
Why would you say that?

14:39.338 --> 14:41.441
I can tell
when someone's been inside.

14:41.474 --> 14:43.476
It's a gift I have.

14:46.612 --> 14:49.215
Here's the problem
with a backer.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.785
He puts up the money,
you split the winnings.

14:52.819 --> 14:54.787
That's all good,
but if you lose,

14:54.821 --> 14:57.256
you have to pay those losses
out of future winnings.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.725
Right? That only makes sense.

14:58.758 --> 15:01.728
And slowly, you build weight.

15:01.761 --> 15:04.597
You go to any poker website,
look up the top ten winners...

15:04.630 --> 15:08.468
millions in earnings...
50% of them are underwater.

15:08.501 --> 15:10.838
Swamped in debt
they'll never repay.

15:10.871 --> 15:14.373
If you don't play for money,
why do you play at all?

15:15.341 --> 15:17.543
It passes the time.

15:19.579 --> 15:21.247
So, Bill...

15:22.615 --> 15:24.885
...why don't you pass
some time with me?

15:24.918 --> 15:26.619
Let's play poker.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.427
<i>In poker, the player does not</i>

15:34.460 --> 15:35.762
<i>play against the house.</i>

15:35.795 --> 15:37.764
<i>He plays against other players.</i>

15:37.797 --> 15:40.299
<i>The house takes a cut.</i>

15:40.333 --> 15:42.301
<i>Two things are necessary:</i>

15:42.335 --> 15:44.670
<i>knowledge of
the mathematical odds,</i>

15:44.704 --> 15:47.573
<i>knowledge of your opponents.</i>

15:47.607 --> 15:49.776
<i>Poker is all about waiting.</i>

15:49.809 --> 15:52.645
<i>Hours pass. Days pass.</i>

15:52.678 --> 15:54.680
<i>Hand after hand,</i>

15:54.714 --> 15:56.783
<i>each hand like the hand before.</i>

16:03.957 --> 16:06.325
<i>Then something happens.</i>

16:18.872 --> 16:21.108
<i>There's a weight
a gambler can accrue</i>

16:21.141 --> 16:23.877
<i>by accepting financial backing.</i>

16:23.911 --> 16:26.914
<i>It's like any weight
a person in debt accrues.</i>

16:28.381 --> 16:31.450
<i>It builds and builds,
has a life of its own.</i>

16:32.752 --> 16:35.588
<i>There also is a moral weight
a man can accrue.</i>

16:38.424 --> 16:41.561
<i>This is the weight created
by his past actions.</i>

16:43.563 --> 16:45.765
<i>It is a weight...</i>

16:46.799 --> 16:49.569
<i>...which can never be removed.</i>

17:18.198 --> 17:20.599
Your attention, please.

17:20.633 --> 17:22.602
The Correctional Officers
Association mixer

17:22.635 --> 17:25.005
- has been moved...
- Nice playing with you.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.508
Welcome, sir.

18:58.065 --> 19:00.700
Polygraphs have
historically been

19:00.733 --> 19:02.836
the problem child
of investigation

19:02.869 --> 19:05.005
in law enforcement.

19:05.038 --> 19:07.573
This may soon change.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.675
Vocat Electronics has developed

19:09.709 --> 19:13.981
a 22-point facial recognition
software...

19:15.614 --> 19:18.718
...that uses
a proprietary algorithm

19:18.751 --> 19:21.922
to interact with CQT detection.

19:21.955 --> 19:24.992
This software, called STABL,

19:25.025 --> 19:27.593
is in the beta testing phase.

19:27.626 --> 19:31.697
Vocat will soon be offering
a test version of this software

19:31.731 --> 19:33.900
to qualified law enforcement

19:33.934 --> 19:37.770
and public incarceration
agencies.

19:39.039 --> 19:41.741
Vocat makes no great claims

19:41.774 --> 19:46.079
but thinks this advance
of potential truth detection

19:46.113 --> 19:48.781
needs some field experience.

19:48.814 --> 19:50.549
How reliable is it?

19:50.583 --> 19:52.618
How does it work?

19:52.651 --> 19:55.055
That's what I want
to get into now.

19:55.088 --> 19:58.824
I prepared this
PowerPoint demonstration

19:58.859 --> 20:00.827
with a volunteer from the
Milwaukee Police Department...

20:00.861 --> 20:02.628
Do you remember him?

20:02.661 --> 20:04.898
...misclassifying innocent
subjects, false positives.

20:04.931 --> 20:06.766
This is my number.

20:06.799 --> 20:08.634
I'm staying at this hotel.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.003
Cumulative research evidence
suggests

20:10.037 --> 20:15.008
that CQT detects deception
better than chance

20:15.042 --> 20:18.512
but with significant
error rates.

20:21.014 --> 20:22.949
<i>The smartest bet for a novice</i>

20:22.983 --> 20:25.185
<i>is red/black in roulette.</i>

20:25.218 --> 20:27.720
<i>Your odds are 47.4%.</i>

20:27.753 --> 20:29.655
No more bets.

20:29.688 --> 20:32.159
<i>You win, you walk away.</i>

20:32.192 --> 20:34.995
<i>You lose, you walk away.</i>

20:35.028 --> 20:37.596
<i>It's the only smart casino bet.</i>

20:37.630 --> 20:39.900
14, red.

21:44.164 --> 21:45.999
No!

21:46.032 --> 21:47.834
Where's my shoe?

21:47.868 --> 21:50.137
Hey! Get the fuck back!

21:50.170 --> 21:52.272
Where's my shoe, guys?

21:52.305 --> 21:54.174
Shoe!

21:57.710 --> 21:59.745
Get the fuck back!

21:59.778 --> 22:01.882
Now!

22:01.915 --> 22:03.884
Get up!

24:07.874 --> 24:09.142
Hi.

24:09.175 --> 24:11.177
Johnnie Walker, double, neat.

24:11.211 --> 24:13.313
- Please.
- You got it.

24:20.287 --> 24:21.820
Hello.

24:21.855 --> 24:23.256
Yeah, you gave me
a piece of paper

24:23.290 --> 24:26.359
with your number on it
earlier tonight.

24:26.393 --> 24:28.194
You awake?

24:29.462 --> 24:31.431
I'm here. I'm at the bar.

24:31.464 --> 24:33.799
The one by the elevators.

24:35.101 --> 24:37.070
I'll wait.

24:48.315 --> 24:50.250
You want a drink?

24:51.251 --> 24:53.219
Yeah, I'll have one of those.

24:53.253 --> 24:54.988
Another. The same.

24:55.021 --> 24:56.923
Sure.

24:56.956 --> 24:58.391
Let's sit.

25:10.136 --> 25:12.238
So, what was that all about?

25:14.507 --> 25:16.843
What?

25:18.011 --> 25:21.414
You giving me a piece of paper
with your name and number on it.

25:21.448 --> 25:24.284
You remember Major John Gordo?

25:26.119 --> 25:28.154
Of course,
he's not a major anymore.

25:28.188 --> 25:30.123
He just uses that title.

25:31.291 --> 25:33.259
What are you talking about?

25:34.260 --> 25:36.262
PFC William Tillich.

25:36.296 --> 25:38.164
Isn't that your name?

25:39.165 --> 25:40.667
I've done my research.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.902
I know your case.

25:46.072 --> 25:47.941
Thank you.

25:50.210 --> 25:52.445
- Who are you?
- Cirk Baufort.

25:52.479 --> 25:54.147
Cirk with a "C."

25:54.180 --> 25:56.383
My father was Roger Baufort.

25:56.416 --> 26:00.153
Gordo trained my father in the
arts of enhanced interrogation.

26:01.521 --> 26:04.391
Roger Baufort?
That name doesn't ring a bell.

26:04.424 --> 26:06.493
Gordo was at Abu Ghraib.

26:06.526 --> 26:08.995
As a private contractor.

26:09.028 --> 26:11.998
My father, he visited him there.

26:12.031 --> 26:14.134
Is this story going anywhere?

26:14.167 --> 26:16.002
The beauty of his scheme
was that Gordo,

26:16.035 --> 26:18.104
once he became
a private contractor,

26:18.138 --> 26:21.307
he couldn't be prosecuted for
crimes not on American soil.

26:21.341 --> 26:23.309
But my father...

26:23.343 --> 26:25.278
wasn't so lucky.

26:25.311 --> 26:29.282
He was dishonorably discharged,
got addicted to oxycodone.

26:29.315 --> 26:31.317
He'd been injured.
He drank heavily.

26:31.351 --> 26:34.287
He beat my mother.
He beat me.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.423
My mother left one day
without saying a word.

26:36.456 --> 26:38.525
Without a suitcase. Just...

26:40.994 --> 26:43.029
That left only me to beat.

26:44.230 --> 26:46.099
Until he shot himself.

26:46.132 --> 26:47.934
That was four years ago.

26:49.536 --> 26:52.205
So I decided I'd just
get into it.

26:52.238 --> 26:55.008
Investigate it for myself,
find out what really happened.

26:55.041 --> 26:57.110
Set things straight.

26:57.143 --> 26:59.446
What does your mother say?

26:59.479 --> 27:02.315
She made her choice.

27:02.348 --> 27:04.451
Do you know where she is?

27:04.484 --> 27:06.286
No.

27:08.788 --> 27:11.224
And how am I involved in this?

27:11.257 --> 27:13.493
Well, there were
a handful of soldiers

27:13.526 --> 27:16.196
that were bad apples,
who were punished,

27:16.229 --> 27:17.497
but those who are
really responsible

27:17.530 --> 27:19.766
are still walking around
out there,

27:19.799 --> 27:21.601
giving lectures at conventions,

27:21.634 --> 27:23.503
getting honorary degrees.

27:23.536 --> 27:25.472
The apples weren't bad.

27:25.505 --> 27:27.540
The barrel they came from
was bad.

27:32.345 --> 27:35.381
You know, when I recognized you
at John Gordo's seminar,

27:35.415 --> 27:37.083
I recognized you instantly.

27:37.116 --> 27:40.086
I thought to myself,

27:40.119 --> 27:44.090
"Here's a man who might want
a piece of what I'm gonna do."

27:44.123 --> 27:46.526
<i>This is how it starts.</i>

27:46.559 --> 27:48.495
<i>Just a fleeting thought.</i>

27:48.528 --> 27:50.363
<i>A daydream.</i>

27:50.396 --> 27:52.365
<i>Then it builds...</i>

27:52.398 --> 27:54.567
<i>and builds.</i>

27:54.601 --> 27:56.536
And what is that?

27:57.637 --> 28:01.274
Capture him,
torture him and kill him.

28:01.307 --> 28:04.110
They made you the fall guy.

28:04.143 --> 28:06.446
They fucked you, PFC Tillich.

28:06.479 --> 28:08.481
- My name is Tell.
- Whatever.

28:08.515 --> 28:11.317
You were in the photos.
No one else was prosecuted.

28:11.351 --> 28:13.353
Just the soldiers in the photos.

28:13.386 --> 28:15.088
They put you in hell.

28:15.121 --> 28:16.623
Then they blamed you for it.

28:16.656 --> 28:18.224
You got the barracks
at Leavenworth,

28:18.258 --> 28:19.826
and Gordo got R and R in Kuwait.

28:19.860 --> 28:22.128
Cirk...

28:22.161 --> 28:24.297
you need to back off.

28:26.432 --> 28:28.401
I've spent a lot of time
thinking

28:28.434 --> 28:31.304
the exact same thoughts
you're thinking right now.

28:33.473 --> 28:35.508
They eat you up.

28:38.511 --> 28:41.047
Are you gonna tell on me?

28:42.582 --> 28:44.284
No.

28:44.317 --> 28:45.853
I'm not.

28:45.886 --> 28:47.855
It's your life.

29:52.285 --> 29:54.320
Cirk with a "C"?

29:55.722 --> 29:58.124
It's Bill Tell.

30:03.496 --> 30:05.498
You want to ride with me?

30:05.531 --> 30:07.367
I'm a card player.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.570
I go from city to city,
casino to casino,

30:10.603 --> 30:13.206
card room to card room.

30:13.239 --> 30:15.508
It gets lonely.

30:15.541 --> 30:18.378
I'd like some company.

30:18.411 --> 30:20.446
I'll cover the costs.

30:42.702 --> 30:44.404
Who is it?

30:44.437 --> 30:46.272
Tell.

30:46.305 --> 30:47.774
Bill.

30:49.575 --> 30:51.544
Come on in.

31:09.830 --> 31:11.564
You live like this?

31:11.597 --> 31:13.599
Well, I was packing.

31:17.336 --> 31:19.806
All right. Let's get your shit
together, get on the road.

31:41.527 --> 31:43.262
Turn it off.

31:43.296 --> 31:44.731
Ah, come on.

31:44.764 --> 31:46.365
Turn that shit off.

31:47.835 --> 31:50.369
Who are you? God?

31:54.440 --> 31:57.577
If you'd ever actually
been there,

31:57.610 --> 32:00.513
you'd never want to hear
that shit again in your life.

32:05.618 --> 32:07.320
So, where are we going?

32:07.353 --> 32:08.755
You never told me.

32:08.788 --> 32:11.357
You never asked.

32:12.358 --> 32:15.428
There's a racino
at Delaware Park.

32:15.461 --> 32:18.731
Delaware casinos are tied
into race tracks.

32:20.466 --> 32:22.735
I'm not really into
playing cards.

32:24.537 --> 32:26.506
Do you like sports?

32:26.539 --> 32:28.075
Yeah.

32:28.108 --> 32:30.810
Well, they have
a great sports book.

32:30.844 --> 32:33.379
Yeah, but that costs money.
I mean...

32:33.412 --> 32:35.414
how much is it gonna cost me?

32:35.448 --> 32:36.917
'Cause I can't really go around

32:36.950 --> 32:39.519
spending my money like that
on sports betting.

32:39.552 --> 32:42.890
<i>Who is this insolent
little prick?</i>

32:44.524 --> 32:46.492
I did play fantasy football

32:46.526 --> 32:48.795
with the guys a while back,
but...

32:48.829 --> 32:50.730
I don't suppose that counts.

32:50.763 --> 32:53.100
What about college?
What happened there?

32:53.133 --> 32:55.568
It wasn't for me.

32:56.970 --> 32:58.839
How much debt you got?

32:58.872 --> 33:00.807
Some.

33:02.876 --> 33:04.744
A lot.

33:08.581 --> 33:10.616
And you want to go back?

33:12.853 --> 33:14.922
I got out of the mood.

33:14.955 --> 33:17.423
Do you have any interests?

33:17.456 --> 33:19.559
What do you mean?

33:19.592 --> 33:21.794
Interests, like...

33:21.829 --> 33:24.597
anything you want to do:
an occupation, a business.

33:26.632 --> 33:28.701
I got interests.

33:34.007 --> 33:36.409
<i>Sports betting is
a world unto itself.</i>

33:36.442 --> 33:37.710
<i>There's a hundred games</i>

33:37.743 --> 33:39.545
going on around the world
at any given moment.

33:39.579 --> 33:40.948
That's a lot of information.

33:40.981 --> 33:42.850
But the algorithms here
at the house are faster

33:42.883 --> 33:44.517
and better
and quicker than you,

33:44.550 --> 33:45.853
so unless you have
inside information,

33:45.886 --> 33:48.454
sports betting is just for fun.

33:48.487 --> 33:49.990
Here's a couple hundred bucks.

33:50.023 --> 33:52.926
You pick two teams,
place some bets, have some fun.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.962
I'm gonna go play
some blackjack.

33:54.995 --> 33:57.931
Here's walking-around money.

34:01.734 --> 34:03.170
Just, uh, a second.

34:03.203 --> 34:05.671
It's just a little damn noisy
out there.

34:05.705 --> 34:07.707
Oh, that's a lot better.

34:07.740 --> 34:09.742
Hey, La Linda, you there?

34:11.643 --> 34:13.746
Uh, I'm at Delaware Raceway.

34:16.782 --> 34:19.452
Electricians.

34:19.485 --> 34:21.889
So, uh, I've been thinking
about what you were saying

34:21.922 --> 34:23.924
and having some second thoughts.

34:23.956 --> 34:25.757
I might be interested in, uh,

34:25.791 --> 34:27.760
in what-what you were
talking about.

34:30.795 --> 34:32.732
Yeah, I realize that.

34:32.764 --> 34:35.002
I just think that we could take
the conversation to the...

34:35.034 --> 34:37.004
the next step.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.675
After this, back up to AC.

34:46.246 --> 34:47.813
Okay.

34:48.916 --> 34:50.716
All right.

35:02.029 --> 35:04.965
<i>Is there an end to punishment?</i>

35:04.998 --> 35:07.633
<i>Is there a limit to
the amount of effort it takes</i>

35:07.667 --> 35:09.535
<i>to merit expiation?</i>

35:10.703 --> 35:13.974
<i>Is it possible to know
when one reaches the limit?</i>

36:03.323 --> 36:06.293
Well, here she is.

36:06.326 --> 36:08.095
Madam.

36:08.128 --> 36:10.596
Join us.

36:10.629 --> 36:11.999
La Linda, I'd like
to introduce you

36:12.032 --> 36:14.001
to the young man
formerly known as Cirk Baufort.

36:14.034 --> 36:16.103
Now we just call him the Kid.

36:16.136 --> 36:17.703
Yep. That's Cirk with a "C."

36:17.737 --> 36:18.939
- Yeah.
- Pleased to meet you, Kid.

36:18.972 --> 36:20.841
King of sports book, the Kid is.

36:20.874 --> 36:22.808
Yesterday, played two games,
hit 'em both on a double pop.

36:22.843 --> 36:24.144
Oh. Give me some of your luck.

36:26.046 --> 36:27.848
Uh, La Linda and I just have
something we want to discuss.

36:27.881 --> 36:29.016
- Maybe...
- Yeah.

36:29.049 --> 36:30.583
I'll, uh,
give the slots a whirl.

36:30.616 --> 36:32.651
All right.
Bet small, lose small.

36:34.187 --> 36:36.890
He's a good kid.

36:36.923 --> 36:39.960
What was this thing
you wanted to talk about?

36:39.993 --> 36:44.663
Uh, well, I may want
to build up a nest egg,

36:44.697 --> 36:48.035
and, uh, to do that,
I need a backer.

36:48.068 --> 36:50.137
Well, that's a dramatic turn.

36:51.371 --> 36:53.672
You woke something in me.

36:56.043 --> 36:57.878
I don't know.

36:57.911 --> 36:59.913
It's the Kid. He needs help.

36:59.946 --> 37:01.915
And money will do that?

37:01.948 --> 37:04.084
He's got debts.

37:04.117 --> 37:06.786
So, where do we start?

37:06.819 --> 37:09.122
Well, jump on one
of these WSOP tours.

37:09.156 --> 37:11.690
They got an event every week.

37:11.724 --> 37:13.759
And you'll come up fast
if you're willing to travel.

37:13.793 --> 37:15.829
I am.

37:15.862 --> 37:17.831
We'll start
on the East Coast for now.

37:17.864 --> 37:19.199
Tease 'em.

37:19.232 --> 37:21.168
Vegas?

37:21.201 --> 37:23.203
That's where the money is.

37:23.236 --> 37:25.205
Do I have to meet the backer?

37:25.238 --> 37:27.807
For some people,
it's an ego thing.

37:27.841 --> 37:29.843
- Others don't care.
- Mm-hmm.

37:29.876 --> 37:31.945
I'll find something
that suits you.

37:36.682 --> 37:39.785
I build my nest egg, I bail.

37:40.887 --> 37:42.956
One year max, then I'm out.

37:45.992 --> 37:48.661
I wish I could believe that.

37:48.694 --> 37:50.864
Believe.

37:56.036 --> 37:57.803
I'm too old for this.

37:57.838 --> 37:59.873
- Mwah. Bye.
- Bye.

38:08.248 --> 38:11.184
The other day, you asked me,

38:11.218 --> 38:14.154
"What was the greatest hand
of poker ever played?"

38:15.856 --> 38:18.992
And I can only speak
for what I have seen,

38:19.025 --> 38:21.727
and this...

38:21.760 --> 38:24.131
is the best hand I ever saw.

38:24.164 --> 38:27.934
2012, Indian casino in Iowa.

38:27.968 --> 38:31.670
Blackbird Bend, Omaha Nation.

38:31.704 --> 38:33.772
10K tournament.

38:33.806 --> 38:36.843
Goldie... Asian player,
wore a lot of gold...

38:36.877 --> 38:39.045
and Alex Karesco,
WSOP champion.

38:39.079 --> 38:40.881
You may have heard of him.

38:40.914 --> 38:44.017
Alex has pocket queens,

38:44.050 --> 38:46.286
clubs and diamonds.

38:46.319 --> 38:49.856
Goldie has
eight, nine of diamonds.

38:51.790 --> 38:52.859
How'd you do that?

38:52.893 --> 38:54.094
Practice. I was in a place

38:54.127 --> 38:56.129
where I had a lot of time
on my hands.

38:56.163 --> 38:57.696
Now the flop.

38:57.730 --> 38:59.299
Ten of spades,

38:59.332 --> 39:01.835
jack of diamonds,
queen of hearts.

39:03.170 --> 39:04.905
There's blood in the water.

39:06.072 --> 39:08.175
Both players think
they're ahead.

39:08.208 --> 39:10.844
It goes check, raise,

39:10.877 --> 39:13.113
reraise, re-reraise,

39:13.146 --> 39:14.915
call.

39:14.948 --> 39:16.917
Alex and Goldie head-to-head.

39:16.950 --> 39:18.952
Now the turn.

39:18.985 --> 39:21.787
Ten of diamonds. Now...

39:21.820 --> 39:24.191
there is only one card
that gets Goldie out.

39:24.224 --> 39:25.892
There's a two percent chance

39:25.926 --> 39:27.826
the river will come
the seven of diamonds.

39:27.861 --> 39:30.330
Alex has a 98% chance of winning

39:30.363 --> 39:32.098
with queens full of tens.

39:32.132 --> 39:34.067
Goldie looks at the damage.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.203
He doesn't even have
a pot-sized bet left behind.

39:36.236 --> 39:39.906
Makes this little sucking sound
that the Japanese do.

39:42.909 --> 39:44.110
Then he goes all in.

39:44.144 --> 39:46.012
Alex calls.

39:46.046 --> 39:47.981
Now the river.

39:49.815 --> 39:51.750
Seven of diamonds.

39:51.784 --> 39:54.287
Straight flush beats
a full house. Goldie wins.

39:54.321 --> 39:55.989
You saw that game?

39:56.022 --> 39:57.857
Haven't been to Iowa since.

39:57.891 --> 39:59.960
Could you top us off, please?

40:08.969 --> 40:10.937
So this, um...

40:12.872 --> 40:15.942
...this plan you have

40:15.976 --> 40:18.144
about Major John Gordo...

40:18.178 --> 40:20.280
you given it more thought?

40:21.381 --> 40:23.116
He's all nails.

40:23.149 --> 40:25.185
You're not.

40:25.218 --> 40:27.320
He's right out of fucking
<i>Call of Duty.</i>

40:29.289 --> 40:31.757
How you gonna do that?

40:32.892 --> 40:34.828
Well...

40:34.861 --> 40:36.963
there would need to be
a tranquilizer.

40:36.997 --> 40:39.866
Ketamine, combined with Telazol.

40:39.899 --> 40:42.235
It can be administered
by a dart pistol.

40:43.236 --> 40:45.171
Where'd you find out about this?

40:45.205 --> 40:47.274
- The Internet.
- And you have it?

40:47.307 --> 40:49.009
Just the ketamine.

40:49.042 --> 40:51.077
But it's amazing how easy
the stuff is to get.

40:51.111 --> 40:52.879
I mean, I ordered it on a lark.

40:52.912 --> 40:54.314
Three days later, it arrived.

40:55.849 --> 40:57.884
This isn't
very well thought out.

40:59.052 --> 41:01.921
And that's why I need a partner.

41:01.955 --> 41:05.892
Somebody with experience,
somebody with expertise.

41:05.925 --> 41:07.927
And motive.

41:07.961 --> 41:09.829
A strong guy.

41:09.863 --> 41:11.398
A guy like you.

41:15.368 --> 41:17.237
Let's...

41:17.270 --> 41:21.074
roll back your scenario
for a moment.

41:21.107 --> 41:23.610
You've located John Gordo.

41:23.643 --> 41:26.046
You shot him with a dart.

41:26.079 --> 41:27.947
He's gaga.

41:27.981 --> 41:29.949
What next?

41:33.153 --> 41:35.355
Strip him naked.

41:35.388 --> 41:38.058
Put a hood over his head.

41:38.091 --> 41:41.027
One of those green
military sandbags.

41:41.061 --> 41:43.229
You can find them on eBay.

41:44.230 --> 41:46.066
Handcuff him.

41:46.099 --> 41:48.868
Hang him from the ceiling,
keep him from sleeping.

41:50.136 --> 41:54.240
Make him try to jerk off
while I hit him in the legs.

41:56.443 --> 41:58.411
Did your father tell you
about this?

41:58.445 --> 42:01.014
No, he never talked about it.

42:02.248 --> 42:04.351
He kept it all inside.

42:04.384 --> 42:06.319
He beat you.

42:07.287 --> 42:08.922
That's in the past.

42:08.955 --> 42:10.190
The body remembers.

42:10.223 --> 42:12.192
It stores it all.

42:14.194 --> 42:16.162
Do you want to hear about it?

42:16.196 --> 42:18.131
Would that interest you?

42:19.165 --> 42:21.201
- What?
- You know what.

42:21.234 --> 42:23.269
You're dying to hear.

42:33.947 --> 42:36.116
The noise.

42:37.484 --> 42:39.486
The smell.

42:41.054 --> 42:44.457
Feces, urine,

42:44.491 --> 42:47.293
oil, explosives,

42:47.327 --> 42:50.964
bleach, sweat, smoke.

42:50.997 --> 42:53.500
All day, every day.

42:53.533 --> 42:55.502
Sand spiders, camel spiders,

42:55.535 --> 42:58.071
ants as big as cockroaches.

42:58.104 --> 43:00.473
The heat, the fear,

43:00.507 --> 43:03.009
the adrenaline jack, mortars.

43:03.042 --> 43:04.477
The sheer noise of it.

43:04.511 --> 43:07.113
And blood.

43:07.147 --> 43:10.350
And the only way to survive
was to rise above.

43:10.383 --> 43:12.318
Rise and laugh.

43:12.352 --> 43:15.021
Surf the craziness.

43:15.054 --> 43:18.391
To see a grown man shit
and piss on himself.

43:19.559 --> 43:21.261
Sing the song, man.

43:21.294 --> 43:24.063
The noise, the fucking noise.

43:26.132 --> 43:28.001
The noise.

43:29.102 --> 43:30.737
We were all just trapped
in there,

43:30.770 --> 43:35.208
in the same shit,
sh-sh... shithole.

43:37.343 --> 43:39.312
Them and us.

43:42.415 --> 43:45.385
And am I trying to justify
what we did?

43:48.788 --> 43:50.457
No.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.229
Nothing...

43:57.797 --> 44:01.100
Nothing can justify
what we did.

44:04.370 --> 44:06.506
Your father understood that.

44:08.341 --> 44:10.977
If you were there,
you could understand.

44:11.644 --> 44:15.081
Otherwise, there's no...

44:15.114 --> 44:17.116
understanding.

44:49.115 --> 44:51.117
Minnesota?

44:55.355 --> 44:57.357
When was the last time?

44:57.390 --> 44:59.192
Orlando?

44:59.225 --> 45:00.660
Oxford Downs. That's right.

45:00.693 --> 45:02.562
- You were with Clickity Dick.
- USA! USA!

45:02.595 --> 45:04.664
I'd like to put a cap
in that motherfucker.

45:04.697 --> 45:07.166
Now, take it smooth, Minnie.

45:07.200 --> 45:10.236
And exercise those legs.

45:13.606 --> 45:15.608
They call him Minnesota Fats
after the movie.

45:15.642 --> 45:17.510
You know, there's not
a lot of fat people

45:17.544 --> 45:19.512
that play
professional poker anymore.

45:19.546 --> 45:21.681
I like to call him
Charlie Two Chins.

45:21.714 --> 45:23.449
Why is that?

45:23.483 --> 45:25.485
'Cause he got more chins
than a Chinese phone book.

45:25.518 --> 45:27.420
Thanks for the straight line.

45:27.453 --> 45:29.322
Minnesota Fats played pool
in that movie.

45:29.355 --> 45:31.357
- No, poker.
- No, that's Cincinnati Kid.

45:31.391 --> 45:33.259
Oh, whatever.

45:42.302 --> 45:44.170
<i>The preferred poker variant</i>

45:44.203 --> 45:47.473
<i>for multi-table tournaments
is no-limit Texas Hold'em.</i>

45:47.507 --> 45:50.476
<i>It encourages large pots
and large raises.</i>

45:50.510 --> 45:54.080
<i>The prize money is split
between the top five players.</i>

45:55.315 --> 45:57.116
<i>Before the hole cards are dealt,</i>

45:57.150 --> 45:59.586
<i>the player to the left
of the button must post</i>

45:59.619 --> 46:01.287
<i>small and big blinds.</i>

46:02.622 --> 46:06.392
<i>This stimulates action, and
the blinds go up every hour.</i>

46:12.632 --> 46:15.168
<i>The rest of the cards
are common cards.</i>

46:18.571 --> 46:20.607
<i>The flop, three cards.</i>

46:31.517 --> 46:33.319
1,800.

46:47.333 --> 46:49.469
<i>The turn.</i>

47:08.321 --> 47:10.456
<i>And the river.</i>

47:10.490 --> 47:13.526
<i>The river can instantly turn
a losing hand into a winner.</i>

47:13.559 --> 47:16.262
<i>That's Hold'em's
betting appeal.</i>

47:16.295 --> 47:17.563
All in.

47:50.030 --> 47:52.331
What happened? You get bored?

47:52.365 --> 47:54.300
Played some slots.

47:54.333 --> 47:56.469
You should read some books.

47:56.502 --> 47:57.838
I'm gonna buy you one.

47:57.871 --> 47:59.605
I've read books.

47:59.639 --> 48:01.274
What is it with her?

48:01.307 --> 48:02.642
- Name one.
- One what?

48:02.675 --> 48:04.577
Book.

48:04.610 --> 48:06.512
How 'bout <i>Poker for Dummies.</i>

48:06.546 --> 48:08.314
I believe you may have read it.

48:08.347 --> 48:10.450
I like him.

48:13.053 --> 48:15.655
Wow. You made it
to the second dinner break.

48:15.688 --> 48:18.791
I must have fired
two dozen tournaments

48:18.825 --> 48:21.461
before I lasted that long.

48:21.494 --> 48:23.831
So, how many are left?

48:23.864 --> 48:26.766
Four tables,
so should be done tomorrow.

48:28.334 --> 48:30.369
How much cards do you play?

48:33.406 --> 48:35.441
40 hands an hour,

48:35.475 --> 48:38.344
eight to 12 hours a day,
six to seven days a week.

48:38.377 --> 48:40.446
Do you do anything else?

48:40.480 --> 48:41.849
Like what?

48:41.882 --> 48:43.549
Like anything.

48:43.583 --> 48:46.719
Go to a park,
a concert, a museum.

48:46.753 --> 48:48.621
- Museum?
- Yeah.

48:48.654 --> 48:50.490
I'll buy you a book on it.
It's called...

48:50.523 --> 48:51.859
<i>Museums for Dummies.</i>

48:51.892 --> 48:54.660
Ba-dum-bum.

48:54.694 --> 48:58.364
No, but seriously,
you should do something else.

48:58.397 --> 49:00.366
Just for variety.

49:04.604 --> 49:06.672
I like playing cards.

49:23.589 --> 49:25.691
USA!

49:25.725 --> 49:28.795
USA! USA! USA!

49:35.836 --> 49:38.504
That's $800,000.

49:38.538 --> 49:40.107
Where do they get their money?

49:40.140 --> 49:41.842
Geez Louise.

49:41.875 --> 49:43.543
Slow down, Kid.

49:43.576 --> 49:45.778
You see the purple chips?
What do they say?

49:45.812 --> 49:47.547
5,000.

49:47.580 --> 49:48.949
5,000 what?

49:48.982 --> 49:50.851
5,000 grains of rice?

49:50.884 --> 49:52.618
That's not money.

49:52.652 --> 49:54.420
Those are tournament chips.

49:54.453 --> 49:55.755
We just call them dollars.

49:55.788 --> 49:57.523
It's good publicity.

49:57.557 --> 49:59.559
So, how much is it?

49:59.592 --> 50:02.695
Depends on the buy-in
and the split.

50:02.728 --> 50:06.632
A game like this,
there's about 500,000 in play.

50:06.666 --> 50:09.136
The winner will get 150,

50:09.169 --> 50:12.805
runner-up anywhere 70 to 80,
and so on.

50:12.840 --> 50:16.442
- Oh, yeah!
- USA! USA!

50:16.475 --> 50:20.546
USA! USA! USA!

50:20.580 --> 50:22.448
You know who he is?

50:22.481 --> 50:23.716
Who?

50:23.749 --> 50:26.619
Bill Tell or whatever
his real name is.

50:26.652 --> 50:28.588
You know who he is, right?

50:28.621 --> 50:31.691
All I've ever heard was
William Tell.

50:31.724 --> 50:33.693
Why do you think
he has another name?

50:33.726 --> 50:35.728
You've been around him.

50:35.761 --> 50:37.865
He's a mystery.

50:37.898 --> 50:40.901
And I don't know if that's
a good thing or a bad thing.

50:40.934 --> 50:43.436
Am I in any danger?

50:43.469 --> 50:44.670
Of what?

50:44.704 --> 50:46.472
Falling in love?

50:46.505 --> 50:49.408
Don't be a child.

50:49.442 --> 50:51.444
What is his past?

50:51.477 --> 50:53.180
I haven't asked.

50:53.213 --> 50:54.982
Well, what are you two
doing together?

50:55.015 --> 50:56.749
I don't have any goals.

50:56.782 --> 50:59.719
I'm just along for the ride,
one day at a time.

50:59.752 --> 51:01.587
Hmm.

51:03.522 --> 51:05.691
What do you think
he's holding?

51:05.725 --> 51:08.594
I don't know, but if
you be quiet, we'll find out.

51:11.031 --> 51:12.933
All in.

51:18.638 --> 51:20.573
Call.

51:25.511 --> 51:28.048
Oh, yeah! USA!

51:28.081 --> 51:30.783
USA! USA!

51:30.816 --> 51:34.587
USA! USA!

51:36.522 --> 51:39.592
- USA!
- That's it, baby.

51:45.498 --> 51:47.600
All right.

51:47.633 --> 51:49.735
54,000 for a night's work.

51:49.769 --> 51:51.905
Hope you're not disappointed.

51:51.939 --> 51:55.775
That's, uh, 27 for you,
27 for me.

51:55.808 --> 51:58.011
Let me sign this.

51:58.045 --> 52:00.013
Hey, uh, excuse me a second.

52:00.047 --> 52:01.647
Got to hose it.

52:01.681 --> 52:02.950
All right.

52:02.983 --> 52:04.985
I'll have a Manhattan.

52:05.018 --> 52:07.787
I'll have the, uh...
the same, please.

52:09.655 --> 52:11.959
Here you go.

52:11.992 --> 52:13.994
Thanks.

52:21.134 --> 52:22.936
Thank you.

52:24.104 --> 52:26.873
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

52:33.981 --> 52:37.017
What did you mean when
you said that the other day?

52:38.018 --> 52:39.853
Said what?

52:39.886 --> 52:41.587
I woke you.

52:41.620 --> 52:42.990
What does that mean?

52:45.758 --> 52:48.561
I don't know.
It was just something I said.

52:48.594 --> 52:50.030
It's just a comment.

52:50.063 --> 52:52.099
Mm.

52:52.132 --> 52:54.500
It's a odd thing to say.

52:56.736 --> 52:59.605
So, what's your story?

52:59.638 --> 53:02.009
Everybody's got a story.

53:02.042 --> 53:04.077
What's <i>your</i> story?

53:06.779 --> 53:09.548
Why poker?

53:09.582 --> 53:11.817
Let me guess... it has
something to do with a man.

53:11.852 --> 53:13.954
- Bingo.
- Where was this?

53:15.588 --> 53:17.024
East Saint Louis.

53:17.057 --> 53:18.925
He went outside his zone.

53:18.959 --> 53:20.093
He tilted.

53:20.127 --> 53:21.328
Which direction?

53:21.361 --> 53:22.996
Violence.

53:23.030 --> 53:25.698
But he had some good friends
who liked me,

53:25.731 --> 53:28.135
and they were gamblers,

53:28.168 --> 53:30.904
and I drifted
in that direction.

53:30.937 --> 53:34.941
And... they said I have
very good people skills.

53:36.176 --> 53:39.046
Yeah, I found something
I'm good at.

53:42.082 --> 53:43.984
I like you.

53:47.988 --> 53:50.957
I like this friendship we have.

54:00.934 --> 54:02.903
So, um...

54:02.936 --> 54:04.938
what are your plans?

54:04.971 --> 54:07.606
I like, uh...
I like where it's headed.

54:07.640 --> 54:08.975
I mean tonight.

54:11.912 --> 54:13.779
I got to go back to my motel.

54:13.813 --> 54:15.681
I got some work to do.

54:15.714 --> 54:18.151
You're not staying here?

54:18.185 --> 54:20.120
No, I don't like staying
at casinos.

54:20.153 --> 54:22.856
They know everything about
you... the maids and the staff.

54:22.889 --> 54:24.091
Corridor cameras, noise.

54:24.124 --> 54:26.093
It's not for me.

54:26.126 --> 54:27.994
See you down the road,
La Linda.

54:30.663 --> 54:31.932
Cleveland, right?

54:31.965 --> 54:34.000
Yeah.

55:00.894 --> 55:04.064
<i>His real name was John Rodgers.</i>

55:04.097 --> 55:07.167
<i>"John Gordo" came
sometime later.</i>

55:07.200 --> 55:09.169
<i>He was born in Georgia.</i>

55:09.202 --> 55:11.238
<i>He first came to the attention
of the CIA</i>

55:11.271 --> 55:13.974
<i>during the Contra
counterinsurgency.</i>

55:15.741 --> 55:18.677
<i>He was trained in interrogation
in Nicaragua.</i>

55:19.778 --> 55:21.281
<i>From there, he entered
the SERE program.</i>

55:21.314 --> 55:24.650
<i>Survival, Evasion,
Resistance and Escape.</i>

55:26.019 --> 55:28.687
<i>The program was devised
to help captured U.S. soldiers</i>

55:28.721 --> 55:30.924
<i>withstand hostile
interrogations.</i>

55:30.957 --> 55:32.893
Get the fuck up! Get up!

55:38.298 --> 55:41.268
<i>They were put
into stress conditions.</i>

55:42.302 --> 55:44.905
<i>Sensory deprivation,</i>

55:44.938 --> 55:47.474
<i>confinement in close spaces,</i>

55:47.507 --> 55:50.776
<i>given bombardment with
dangerous decibels of noise.</i>

55:53.847 --> 55:57.250
<i>Starvation, sleep deprivation.</i>

56:00.086 --> 56:01.888
<i>And sexual humiliation.</i>

56:17.971 --> 56:20.207
<i>After the foreign fighters at
the Guantanamo detention camp</i>

56:20.240 --> 56:23.243
<i>were unresponsive
to interrogations,</i>

56:23.276 --> 56:26.079
<i>a decision was made
to reverse engineer</i>

56:26.112 --> 56:27.881
<i>the lessons learned
in the SERE program.</i>

56:30.350 --> 56:32.953
<i>SERE psych op instructors
were brought to Gitmo</i>

56:32.986 --> 56:36.089
<i>to devise enhanced
interrogation techniques.</i>

56:37.557 --> 56:39.825
<i>One of the first to arrive</i>

56:39.859 --> 56:44.064
<i>was consultant John Gordo,
now a civilian.</i>

56:44.097 --> 56:46.132
<i>Lessons learned at Gitmo
were conveyed</i>

56:46.166 --> 56:48.835
<i>to interrogation black sites
around the world.</i>

56:52.872 --> 56:55.075
<i>In 2003, a decision was made</i>

56:55.108 --> 56:57.244
<i>to Gitmo-ize
the civilian prisons</i>

56:57.277 --> 57:00.013
<i>at Bagram Airfield
and Abu Ghraib.</i>

57:02.849 --> 57:06.286
<i>Civilian consultant John Gordo
arrived in May.</i>

57:10.357 --> 57:12.292
Did you go to college, Tillich?

57:12.325 --> 57:14.261
Community college, two years.

57:14.294 --> 57:16.263
They teach you
creativity there?

57:16.296 --> 57:17.864
No, sir.

57:17.897 --> 57:19.299
Well, that's what
it takes here.

57:19.332 --> 57:20.967
Not everything's
black-and-white.

57:21.001 --> 57:22.269
You got to use
your imagination.

57:22.302 --> 57:25.038
This isn't about
following a manual.

57:25.071 --> 57:27.007
It's about getting answers.

57:27.040 --> 57:29.009
Answers that'll save
American lives.

57:29.042 --> 57:30.877
What if they don't know
the answers?

57:30.910 --> 57:32.879
They all say that.

57:32.912 --> 57:34.414
That's their culture.

57:34.447 --> 57:36.383
Follow me.

57:36.416 --> 57:38.218
Wake him up!

57:38.251 --> 57:41.121
Baufort, get in there.

57:41.154 --> 57:43.290
Time to talk, little buddy.

57:43.323 --> 57:46.159
Up! Let's go!

57:49.062 --> 57:51.031
Go!

57:51.064 --> 57:53.033
I'll be right back.

57:53.066 --> 57:54.401
Tillich...

57:54.434 --> 57:56.836
I like you.

57:56.870 --> 57:59.005
I think you got what it takes.

57:59.039 --> 58:01.207
You got the right stuff.

58:01.241 --> 58:04.044
I'm gonna put you
on night shift.

58:04.077 --> 58:07.347
That's where all
the good stuff happens.

58:07.380 --> 58:10.984
Okay, let's fuck this Ahmed up!

58:12.118 --> 58:15.155
Greer. Wipe that shit
off of him.

58:15.188 --> 58:18.325
Your easy days are over, Ahmed.

58:18.358 --> 58:20.060
Come on.

58:20.093 --> 58:22.062
Get him up. Get him up.

58:25.265 --> 58:27.067
<i>Gordo was right.</i>

58:28.234 --> 58:30.236
<i>I had it in me.</i>

58:33.206 --> 58:35.375
<i>I had the right stuff.</i>

58:55.295 --> 58:57.263
<i>The Kid was right.</i>

58:57.297 --> 59:00.433
<i>When those photos came out,
Gordo vanished.</i>

59:04.270 --> 59:08.241
<i>The only ones prosecuted
were in the pictures.</i>

59:08.274 --> 59:10.210
<i>Not their superiors.</i>

59:10.243 --> 59:13.346
<i>Not their superiors' superiors.</i>

59:13.380 --> 59:17.350
<i>Gordo moved on, started
his own consulting company.</i>

59:17.384 --> 59:20.086
<i>I heard he was
working in Cairo.</i>

59:22.188 --> 59:25.525
<i>In the military,
rank means everything.</i>

59:25.558 --> 59:29.162
<i>In USDB, it means nothing.</i>

59:31.164 --> 59:32.365
The f...

59:32.399 --> 59:34.000
- What you doing, man?
- What?

59:34.033 --> 59:35.268
- You got a problem?
- No. I'm sorry.

59:35.301 --> 59:37.404
- You got a problem?
- I'm sorry.

59:37.437 --> 59:39.472
Sorry about that.

01:00:02.328 --> 01:00:05.165
Do it. Do it.

01:00:15.442 --> 01:00:17.444
Bitch.

01:00:25.318 --> 01:00:29.189
<i>Prisoner's name
was Clay Williams.</i>

01:00:29.222 --> 01:00:31.758
<i>I don't know if he's
alive or dead.</i>

01:00:31.791 --> 01:00:33.460
<i>If he were alive,</i>

01:00:33.493 --> 01:00:36.429
<i>I wonder if I could hire him
to finish the job.</i>

01:00:43.503 --> 01:00:46.339
<i>You know,
this ain't such a bad life.</i>

01:00:46.372 --> 01:00:48.408
I think I could
get used to this.

01:00:50.276 --> 01:00:52.111
It's a thin margin.

01:00:52.145 --> 01:00:54.080
It's 24-7.

01:00:54.113 --> 01:00:56.182
Most cats can't cut it.

01:00:58.818 --> 01:01:00.553
So, how'd you meet La Linda?

01:01:00.587 --> 01:01:02.155
I like her.

01:01:02.188 --> 01:01:04.157
She runs a stable.

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:06.059
That's what they call
a group of gamblers

01:01:06.092 --> 01:01:07.327
backed by investors.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.095
The gamblers are the horses.

01:01:09.128 --> 01:01:10.497
The investors put up the money.

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:13.299
Split the winnings
with the, uh... the stable.

01:01:14.501 --> 01:01:17.170
But why don't they just
use their own money?

01:01:18.605 --> 01:01:20.440
OPM.

01:01:22.242 --> 01:01:24.377
Other people's money.

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:28.281
Casino, the TV, the websites...
they all want big pots.

01:01:28.314 --> 01:01:30.383
It's entertainment.

01:01:33.586 --> 01:01:35.522
Hey, where are we going, anyway?

01:01:35.555 --> 01:01:37.390
I thought Saint Louis
was back that way.

01:01:37.423 --> 01:01:39.225
Taking a detour.

01:01:41.294 --> 01:01:44.230
We're gonna take a little trip
down memory lane.

01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:13.293
<i>This was my home
for eight and a half years.</i>

01:02:13.326 --> 01:02:16.062
<i>Since we were near,
I thought we'd drop by.</i>

01:02:18.531 --> 01:02:20.533
Up there, second floor.

01:02:20.567 --> 01:02:22.502
202 B Pod.

01:02:24.237 --> 01:02:27.340
I got my own place
after the first year.

01:02:27.373 --> 01:02:29.475
Then, um...

01:02:29.509 --> 01:02:32.312
another place
on the other side.

01:02:33.713 --> 01:02:35.515
You know that fella
I told you about,

01:02:35.548 --> 01:02:37.317
the one I wanted you to meet?

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.252
He's here.

01:02:39.285 --> 01:02:41.454
Thought I'd pay him a visit.
I've arranged it.

01:02:41.487 --> 01:02:43.456
Want to join?

01:02:44.691 --> 01:02:46.459
Go into a military prison?

01:02:46.492 --> 01:02:48.261
No. No, thanks.

01:02:48.294 --> 01:02:50.196
Well, it's pretty good
as far as prisons go.

01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:52.732
You know, built in 2002.

01:02:52.765 --> 01:02:55.702
Things still work, like toilets.

01:02:55.735 --> 01:02:58.371
Shit, man, I mean,
you walk in there

01:02:58.404 --> 01:03:00.506
and those doors close
behind you, that's fucking it.

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.208
I'm going in.

01:03:02.241 --> 01:03:03.743
Come on.
Think of it as a field trip.

01:03:03.776 --> 01:03:06.613
As a teachable moment.

01:03:06.646 --> 01:03:08.581
I'll wait in the car.

01:03:11.184 --> 01:03:13.152
I'm inviting you.

01:03:15.355 --> 01:03:17.290
I ain't going.

01:03:22.629 --> 01:03:24.430
Just park the car.

01:04:00.299 --> 01:04:02.435
Hey, you ever been
on Google Earth?

01:04:04.504 --> 01:04:06.372
What is that?

01:04:06.406 --> 01:04:08.574
It's where I was when I was
waiting for you. It's amazing.

01:04:08.608 --> 01:04:10.476
Look, you can enter any place
in the world.

01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:12.445
It comes right up.
Street View.

01:04:12.478 --> 01:04:14.447
Look at that.
290 Great Hills Road.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.282
Rockville, Virginia.

01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:18.651
The house, the surroundings,
latitude, longitude.

01:04:18.685 --> 01:04:20.753
That's John Gordo's house.

01:04:22.555 --> 01:04:25.525
Front entrance, back entrance.

01:04:27.027 --> 01:04:29.830
You still got him on the brain?

01:04:29.863 --> 01:04:31.631
Yes, sir.

01:04:33.599 --> 01:04:36.402
I don't think that's
such a great idea.

01:04:46.612 --> 01:04:48.681
How'd it go at Leavenworth?

01:04:55.421 --> 01:04:57.356
You still pissed at me?

01:05:00.894 --> 01:05:03.030
Hey, wasn't La Linda
supposed to meet us here?

01:05:03.063 --> 01:05:04.530
Yeah.

01:05:04.564 --> 01:05:06.466
She'll be here tomorrow.

01:05:06.499 --> 01:05:08.468
Meet us in Saint Louis,

01:05:08.501 --> 01:05:11.337
then do a deep stacks
in Biloxi.

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:14.507
Tunica, and on to Panama City.

01:05:15.843 --> 01:05:17.677
You like her, huh?

01:05:22.582 --> 01:05:24.617
Yeah.

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:26.552
Yeah. Me, too.

01:05:28.454 --> 01:05:30.490
You ever been married?

01:05:35.795 --> 01:05:39.298
When I was in the service,
I was a bit of a ladies' man.

01:05:39.332 --> 01:05:40.767
Thought I was.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.503
But, uh...

01:05:43.536 --> 01:05:46.073
then the other stuff happened.

01:05:46.106 --> 01:05:48.508
The narrative was broken.

01:05:51.477 --> 01:05:53.679
So, how long's it been
since you got laid?

01:05:58.684 --> 01:06:01.420
How long has it been
since you've seen your mother?

01:06:01.454 --> 01:06:03.356
I wouldn't know
where to find her.

01:06:03.389 --> 01:06:05.092
That's bullshit.

01:06:05.125 --> 01:06:07.426
What business is it
of yours, anyway?

01:06:08.427 --> 01:06:10.730
- You remember her?
- Sure.

01:06:10.763 --> 01:06:13.699
Yeah? She reach out to you?

01:06:13.733 --> 01:06:15.768
She try and contact you?

01:06:18.538 --> 01:06:21.340
I'll make you a deal, Kid.

01:06:21.374 --> 01:06:24.310
You go see your mother,
and I'll fucking get laid.

01:06:32.485 --> 01:06:35.388
About earlier:
I don't like prisons.

01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:38.424
Even seeing them
on the highway here,

01:06:38.457 --> 01:06:41.828
looking at it and...
you realize,

01:06:41.862 --> 01:06:44.330
"Oh, my God, that's a prison."

01:06:47.533 --> 01:06:50.536
My dad used to send my mom
letters from Bagram,

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:52.738
and she'd cry.

01:07:02.481 --> 01:07:04.784
There's something
quite similar in poker.

01:07:05.818 --> 01:07:07.687
You know the phrase "tilt"?

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.388
Yeah.

01:07:09.422 --> 01:07:10.891
When a player gets
caught up in winning,

01:07:10.924 --> 01:07:13.559
plays outside his zone.

01:07:13.593 --> 01:07:15.761
Just like in pinball.

01:07:18.031 --> 01:07:20.968
And there's something similar
in interrogations.

01:07:21.001 --> 01:07:23.603
It's called "force drift."

01:07:23.636 --> 01:07:26.806
It happens when
the interrogator applies

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.509
more and more force to
the prisoner with less results.

01:07:31.912 --> 01:07:33.914
The interrogator
becomes intoxicated

01:07:33.947 --> 01:07:36.549
by frustration and power.

01:07:38.451 --> 01:07:40.888
Any man can tilt.

01:07:40.921 --> 01:07:43.489
I can tilt.

01:07:43.522 --> 01:07:45.591
Your father can tilt.

01:07:46.826 --> 01:07:48.929
You can tilt.

01:07:54.734 --> 01:07:56.837
I said ride with me.

01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:58.939
You did.

01:07:58.972 --> 01:08:01.008
You came along.

01:08:02.976 --> 01:08:06.412
What do you think we're up to,
you and me?

01:08:56.095 --> 01:08:58.798
La Linda!

01:09:01.068 --> 01:09:03.669
Here, I preregistered you
with a buy-in.

01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:06.639
Now, your name is getting
some recognition value.

01:09:06.671 --> 01:09:08.640
Well, that's always
a good thing.

01:09:08.674 --> 01:09:10.710
How's the turnout?

01:09:10.743 --> 01:09:13.080
- Uh, it's normal.
- Oh.

01:09:13.113 --> 01:09:15.613
You know that guy, uh,
that's always doing like this?

01:09:15.648 --> 01:09:17.951
- Religious Ronnie.
- Yeah. He's here.

01:09:17.984 --> 01:09:20.519
Got the Santa Tanita
and all that stuff with him.

01:09:20.553 --> 01:09:22.621
- Santeria.
- Santeria...

01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:27.995
Mm, mm, mm.

01:10:22.916 --> 01:10:25.551
Let's get the cards in the air!

01:10:52.711 --> 01:10:53.947
Clock!

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.815
Clock on 38.

01:10:58.885 --> 01:11:00.387
Okay, okay.

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.754
<i>A great player can see</i>

01:11:01.787 --> 01:11:03.924
<i>right into your soul.</i>

01:11:03.957 --> 01:11:06.226
<i>He can wear earplugs,</i>

01:11:06.259 --> 01:11:09.896
<i>a hoodie, a baseball cap,</i>

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:13.834
<i>mirrored glasses, a ski mask,</i>

01:11:13.867 --> 01:11:16.036
<i>but he'll see right
into your soul.</i>

01:11:16.069 --> 01:11:17.803
Call.

01:11:28.248 --> 01:11:30.417
- Where's Cirk?
- He must have crashed.

01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:32.152
I'll call him and wake him up.

01:11:32.185 --> 01:11:34.653
No, that's all right.
Don't bother.

01:11:34.687 --> 01:11:36.123
I want a drink.

01:11:36.156 --> 01:11:38.058
What can I get you-all?

01:11:38.091 --> 01:11:39.725
Uh, I'll have a Tanqueray
on the rocks.

01:11:39.758 --> 01:11:42.129
I'll have a Jack, uh,

01:11:42.162 --> 01:11:44.097
double, neat.

01:11:45.866 --> 01:11:47.134
You talk to him.

01:11:47.167 --> 01:11:49.136
Have you noticed anything
about him lately?

01:11:49.169 --> 01:11:51.737
Like what?

01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:53.739
Moody and...

01:11:53.772 --> 01:11:56.076
I don't... I don't know.

01:11:56.109 --> 01:11:59.146
Well, I got a offer for
a sponsorship from Rock Poker.

01:11:59.179 --> 01:12:00.981
10,000, for you.

01:12:01.014 --> 01:12:03.049
Yeah?
That's the one with the, uh,

01:12:03.083 --> 01:12:05.018
little pony logo
on the titty, right?

01:12:05.051 --> 01:12:07.154
Yeah, the rocking horse
with the word "poker."

01:12:09.055 --> 01:12:12.225
Are you all right?

01:12:12.259 --> 01:12:15.195
Yeah. I'm fucking all right.

01:12:15.228 --> 01:12:16.963
"Fucking all right."

01:12:16.997 --> 01:12:19.933
Crying and shit.

01:12:19.966 --> 01:12:22.135
- What do I have to do for this sponsorship?
- Mm.

01:12:22.169 --> 01:12:23.937
You just have to wear
their T-shirts

01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:25.804
during the tournaments.

01:12:27.073 --> 01:12:29.042
I-I had to ask.

01:12:29.075 --> 01:12:31.011
It was an offer.

01:12:33.213 --> 01:12:35.081
I wish the Kid had been here.

01:12:35.115 --> 01:12:37.184
- Well, let me call him.
- No, it's all right.

01:12:37.217 --> 01:12:39.019
Leave him alone.

01:12:43.089 --> 01:12:45.926
You know you made the cut.
This is your moment.

01:12:47.928 --> 01:12:52.132
You know, I think that you have
the wrong idea about me.

01:12:52.165 --> 01:12:54.968
Yes, I-I want to win the money.

01:12:55.001 --> 01:12:56.870
I want to go
to the World Series,

01:12:56.903 --> 01:12:59.906
but then that's it.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:04.044
This kid Cirk, he needs help.

01:13:04.077 --> 01:13:06.112
He's got financial debts.

01:13:07.247 --> 01:13:09.015
And I understand him.

01:13:09.049 --> 01:13:10.951
And if I can help him,

01:13:10.984 --> 01:13:13.520
maybe he has a chance
to start over again,

01:13:13.553 --> 01:13:16.856
resume his education
and start a life.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:19.960
And you would do all that?

01:13:19.993 --> 01:13:21.827
Well...

01:13:21.861 --> 01:13:23.263
yeah.

01:13:24.231 --> 01:13:25.999
Yeah.

01:13:26.032 --> 01:13:28.535
You have to be the strangest
poker player I ever met.

01:13:28.568 --> 01:13:31.271
- Oh, you have no idea.
- Mm.

01:13:33.139 --> 01:13:35.842
What you doing tomorrow?
You're off.

01:13:39.012 --> 01:13:41.381
I got no plans.

01:13:41.414 --> 01:13:43.984
<i>She said to me,</i>

01:13:44.017 --> 01:13:46.752
<i>"Did you ever see a city
all lit up at night?"</i>

01:13:48.955 --> 01:13:52.025
<i>I said, "Yeah, I've seen
a whole city on fire."</i>

01:13:55.295 --> 01:13:58.164
<i>"Not like that," she said.</i>

01:14:09.909 --> 01:14:11.144
Bobby, you must see this.

01:14:11.177 --> 01:14:12.879
I didn't have it bad.

01:14:12.912 --> 01:14:14.214
Come on, trust me.
This is amazing.

01:14:14.247 --> 01:14:16.149
That's not what I meant to say.

01:14:16.182 --> 01:14:18.251
Of course you know
other people have it better.

01:14:18.285 --> 01:14:21.354
And you learn to be careful
around certain people.

01:14:21.388 --> 01:14:25.191
But I had friends,
and I had family, of course.

01:14:25.225 --> 01:14:26.860
They had a park.

01:14:26.893 --> 01:14:28.295
They lit it up like this.

01:14:28.328 --> 01:14:31.031
Much bigger.

01:14:31.064 --> 01:14:32.866
How would I know?

01:14:32.899 --> 01:14:34.234
I was just a little kid.

01:14:34.267 --> 01:14:35.935
Everything was bigger.

01:14:35.969 --> 01:14:38.238
- This was Saint Louis?
- Yeah.

01:14:41.908 --> 01:14:43.376
You know,
it doesn't matter to me

01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:46.046
if you did something bad
in the past.

01:14:46.079 --> 01:14:48.081
You can tell me about it.

01:14:51.484 --> 01:14:53.819
Yeah, I don't know.

01:14:56.356 --> 01:14:58.858
What could be so bad?

01:15:02.262 --> 01:15:04.130
I was just a kid.

01:15:04.164 --> 01:15:06.066
Everything was bigger.

01:15:06.099 --> 01:15:07.901
Just in your mind.

01:15:48.141 --> 01:15:50.377
I'm glad you suggested
this place.

01:17:17.397 --> 01:17:21.067
No! In the name
of Jesus and Mary,

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.502
what have you done to me?

01:17:22.535 --> 01:17:25.071
I have done nothing to you!

01:17:27.173 --> 01:17:29.275
USA! USA!

01:17:29.309 --> 01:17:33.313
USA! USA! USA!

01:17:52.499 --> 01:17:54.167
Call.

01:19:22.288 --> 01:19:24.090
Hey.

01:19:26.225 --> 01:19:27.594
Where were you?

01:19:27.627 --> 01:19:29.562
Oh, played a little blackjack.

01:19:29.596 --> 01:19:31.464
How'd that go?

01:19:31.497 --> 01:19:33.399
Came out ahead.

01:19:33.433 --> 01:19:35.234
Nice.

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:42.742
How do you like it?

01:19:42.775 --> 01:19:44.577
- Like what?
- This.

01:19:44.611 --> 01:19:46.379
This life...

01:19:46.412 --> 01:19:48.448
we have, you and me.

01:19:49.649 --> 01:19:51.618
Yeah. It's cool.

01:19:51.651 --> 01:19:54.253
That's for sure, but...

01:19:54.287 --> 01:19:56.356
But what?

01:19:58.524 --> 01:20:01.327
It's all the same.

01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:05.198
You know, it's...
it's repetitive.

01:20:05.231 --> 01:20:06.733
It's, uh...

01:20:06.766 --> 01:20:11.170
I don't know if it really feels
like it's going anywhere.

01:20:13.306 --> 01:20:17.510
Well, you know, you just go
around and around

01:20:17.543 --> 01:20:19.545
until you work things out.

01:20:21.714 --> 01:20:23.750
How's that going for you?

01:20:27.687 --> 01:20:29.957
You given it any more thought?

01:20:34.694 --> 01:20:36.462
No.

01:20:41.634 --> 01:20:44.704
You going to
the World Series of Poker?

01:20:44.737 --> 01:20:46.572
Already registered.

01:20:46.606 --> 01:20:47.975
That'll be cool.

01:20:48.008 --> 01:20:50.276
Yeah, that'll be it for me.

01:20:50.309 --> 01:20:52.578
You gonna quit?
Quit the circuit?

01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:56.716
I've done my time.

01:20:58.751 --> 01:21:00.420
Look...

01:21:01.587 --> 01:21:03.589
I don't know if...

01:21:03.623 --> 01:21:06.459
I'm up for going to Vegas.

01:21:08.628 --> 01:21:11.330
Yeah? You gonna bail?

01:21:32.418 --> 01:21:34.487
It's late,
but you got a second?

01:21:36.756 --> 01:21:38.758
Sure.

01:21:39.759 --> 01:21:42.261
I want to show you something.

01:21:42.295 --> 01:21:44.363
You have a moment?

01:21:44.397 --> 01:21:46.232
I got a proposal.

01:21:46.867 --> 01:21:48.768
Come here. Follow me.

01:22:22.535 --> 01:22:24.337
Come on.

01:22:43.823 --> 01:22:45.625
You live like this?

01:22:45.658 --> 01:22:47.527
Sit down.

01:22:55.568 --> 01:22:57.503
Need anything?

01:22:57.537 --> 01:22:59.438
Some water?

01:22:59.472 --> 01:23:01.440
No, I'm fine.

01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:05.745
How about...

01:23:05.778 --> 01:23:08.714
a sandbag
to put over your head?

01:23:11.551 --> 01:23:13.586
They sell them on eBay.

01:23:16.589 --> 01:23:18.624
When civilian contractor
John Gordo

01:23:18.658 --> 01:23:20.726
first approached me
in Abu Ghraib,

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.930
he said I needed
to be more creative.

01:23:22.963 --> 01:23:27.733
He said I had talent
but I lacked imagination.

01:23:27.767 --> 01:23:29.435
Would you agree with that?

01:23:29.468 --> 01:23:31.504
Bill, what the fuck
is going on here?

01:23:31.537 --> 01:23:33.506
Real life is going on.

01:23:34.774 --> 01:23:36.642
World Series of Torture.

01:23:36.676 --> 01:23:38.879
- I'm gonna sp...
- Stay seated!

01:23:40.613 --> 01:23:42.815
You sure I can't get you
any water?

01:23:44.885 --> 01:23:47.553
You may wish
you had accepted later.

01:23:51.024 --> 01:23:53.759
Do I have
your attention now, Cirk?

01:23:54.995 --> 01:23:57.797
Do I? Do I?!

01:23:58.866 --> 01:24:00.700
Yeah.

01:24:00.733 --> 01:24:02.501
Good.

01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:08.942
Are the little nerves at the
ends of your fingers and toes

01:24:08.976 --> 01:24:12.712
and the tip of your dick
starting to tingle with fear?

01:24:16.884 --> 01:24:18.751
Good.

01:24:18.784 --> 01:24:20.820
Let me enhance this
a little bit.

01:24:34.868 --> 01:24:36.970
I've been doing a little
investigating about you,

01:24:37.004 --> 01:24:39.572
Cirk with a "C."

01:24:40.806 --> 01:24:43.509
About your father...
I did meet him at Abu Ghraib.

01:24:43.542 --> 01:24:44.978
I lied about that.

01:24:45.012 --> 01:24:48.714
Your mother,
your time in college,

01:24:48.748 --> 01:24:50.549
your scrapes with the law.

01:24:50.583 --> 01:24:52.785
It's all on the Internet,
of course.

01:24:55.588 --> 01:24:57.823
I'm gonna make you a proposal.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.828
Sit up.

01:25:10.703 --> 01:25:16.575
You have approximately $20,000
in college loan debts.

01:25:23.516 --> 01:25:25.052
20,000.

01:25:26.686 --> 01:25:28.487
To go back to college...

01:25:28.521 --> 01:25:31.892
tuition, expenses,
condoms and so forth...

01:25:31.925 --> 01:25:35.594
it adds up,
so let's say another...

01:25:37.864 --> 01:25:39.833
...80,000.

01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:46.572
On top of that, you've got
$5,000 in credit card debt.

01:25:46.605 --> 01:25:48.909
Your mama... bless her,
she's got her problems...

01:25:48.942 --> 01:25:51.979
she's about 35 grand
underwater,

01:25:52.012 --> 01:25:55.715
with the mortgage and all,
so let's say 40 grand.

01:25:55.748 --> 01:25:57.683
And for the heck of it,
let's throw in

01:25:57.717 --> 01:25:59.286
another ten grand pocket money.

01:25:59.319 --> 01:26:03.723
That's 150 grand, cash,
tax free.

01:26:03.756 --> 01:26:06.659
All that's yours
on one condition.

01:26:06.692 --> 01:26:08.627
And what is that?

01:26:20.841 --> 01:26:24.510
Go see your mother.

01:26:30.183 --> 01:26:33.619
She lives
in Fall River, Oregon.

01:26:33.652 --> 01:26:35.022
I have the address.

01:26:35.055 --> 01:26:36.622
I spoke to her.

01:26:36.655 --> 01:26:38.892
I didn't tell her
who I was, of course.

01:26:38.925 --> 01:26:41.727
Go visit her.

01:26:41.761 --> 01:26:43.696
Forgive her.

01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:45.564
Make things right with her.

01:26:45.598 --> 01:26:47.100
Clear up her debt.

01:26:47.134 --> 01:26:50.103
Tell her about
your college plans.

01:26:50.137 --> 01:26:52.805
Then put her on the phone
with me.

01:26:54.074 --> 01:26:56.910
I want to hear her say
these things.

01:26:56.943 --> 01:26:59.012
I want to hear her voice.

01:27:08.188 --> 01:27:10.123
You serious?

01:27:12.758 --> 01:27:14.560
Yes.

01:27:20.033 --> 01:27:22.568
And if I don't?

01:27:24.905 --> 01:27:27.974
This is not a proposal
you can afford to reject.

01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:32.778
And if you cheat me,

01:27:32.812 --> 01:27:34.814
I'll find you.

01:27:36.016 --> 01:27:38.051
You don't want that to happen.

01:27:42.155 --> 01:27:44.991
I don't like celebrity gambling.

01:27:46.126 --> 01:27:48.761
I like anonymous gambling.

01:27:48.794 --> 01:27:50.763
I did this for you.

01:27:52.165 --> 01:27:54.201
You hear what I'm saying?

01:28:03.176 --> 01:28:05.112
Yeah.

01:28:06.146 --> 01:28:08.014
Do we have a deal?

01:28:13.286 --> 01:28:15.222
Yeah, we have a deal.

01:28:16.822 --> 01:28:19.059
Thank you.

01:28:19.092 --> 01:28:20.961
Okay.

01:28:20.994 --> 01:28:22.728
Let's give her a call.

01:28:22.761 --> 01:28:25.432
She'll still be up right now.

01:28:25.465 --> 01:28:27.100
Yeah.

01:29:01.902 --> 01:29:03.802
One sec!

01:29:04.838 --> 01:29:06.072
Who is it?

01:29:06.106 --> 01:29:07.941
It's William.

01:29:10.844 --> 01:29:12.778
What's up? Thought we were
meeting in the pit.

01:29:12.811 --> 01:29:14.080
- You cool?
- Yeah.

01:29:14.114 --> 01:29:15.982
Yeah.

01:29:16.016 --> 01:29:18.118
Uh, we got final table
tomorrow.

01:29:18.151 --> 01:29:20.053
Yeah, no, I know.
2:30, right?

01:29:20.086 --> 01:29:21.955
Hey, where's your sidekick?

01:29:21.988 --> 01:29:24.491
Oh, yeah, he had to...
he had to go home.

01:29:24.524 --> 01:29:26.259
His mom's not feeling well.

01:29:26.293 --> 01:29:28.061
- He has a mom?
- Yeah.

01:29:28.094 --> 01:29:29.762
Believe it or not.

01:29:29.795 --> 01:29:31.231
So, what's on your mind?

01:29:31.264 --> 01:29:33.066
Um...

01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:38.804
I made a promise to Cirk
before I left.

01:29:38.838 --> 01:29:40.941
You know, he talks about you.
He fancies you.

01:29:40.974 --> 01:29:44.077
You mean he
fancies himself a matchmaker.

01:29:46.012 --> 01:29:49.282
I promised him that I'd...

01:29:49.316 --> 01:29:52.886
act on these feelings I have.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.990
These feelings towards you.

01:29:57.023 --> 01:29:58.258
Oh.

01:29:58.291 --> 01:30:00.726
I think you may have them, too.

01:30:09.135 --> 01:30:10.904
You do, huh?

01:30:10.937 --> 01:30:12.771
Yes, I do.

01:30:26.987 --> 01:30:28.821
<i>The feeling of being</i>

01:30:28.855 --> 01:30:32.292
<i>forgiven by another
and forgiving oneself</i>

01:30:32.325 --> 01:30:34.760
<i>are so much alike...</i>

01:30:36.429 --> 01:30:39.798
<i>...there's no point in trying
to keep them distinct.</i>

01:30:44.104 --> 01:30:46.039
How much time we got?

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.975
Come look at this.

01:30:51.044 --> 01:30:52.811
What?

01:30:54.114 --> 01:30:55.982
Cirk?

01:30:56.016 --> 01:30:57.884
My God, Cirk, is that you?

01:30:57.917 --> 01:30:59.886
- Yeah, Mom. Yeah, Mom, it's me.
- What? Where are you?

01:30:59.919 --> 01:31:01.955
I'm in Panama City.

01:31:01.988 --> 01:31:03.323
Well, what's happening?

01:31:03.356 --> 01:31:05.325
It-it's been so long.

01:31:05.358 --> 01:31:08.862
Mom, I've been thinking, and...

01:31:08.895 --> 01:31:11.164
I haven't been fair to you.

01:31:11.197 --> 01:31:13.199
I want to come and see you.

01:31:15.035 --> 01:31:17.037
Are you... are you all right?

01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:18.305
So it goes on
like that for a while.

01:31:18.338 --> 01:31:20.006
Got a little maudlin.

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.841
She lives outside of Portland.

01:31:21.875 --> 01:31:23.310
He'll be there in a day or two.

01:31:23.343 --> 01:31:25.845
- He'll call me from there.
- Mm.

01:31:25.879 --> 01:31:28.181
How'd you get him to do that?

01:31:28.214 --> 01:31:30.216
He wanted to.

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:32.886
Just needed an excuse.

01:31:32.919 --> 01:31:34.287
I may go visit them.

01:31:34.321 --> 01:31:37.324
I never played the Northwest.

01:31:37.357 --> 01:31:40.226
And welcome to the final table.

01:31:48.935 --> 01:31:50.270
You keep tabs on this.

01:31:50.303 --> 01:31:52.372
- I'm expecting a call.
- Mm-hmm.

01:32:22.402 --> 01:32:24.938
Yes!

01:32:24.971 --> 01:32:27.240
USA! USA!

01:32:27.273 --> 01:32:29.209
USA!

01:32:38.151 --> 01:32:40.086
Well done.

01:32:45.325 --> 01:32:47.160
All right, players.

01:32:47.193 --> 01:32:48.695
That's the end of the level.

01:32:48.728 --> 01:32:50.697
90-minute dinner break.

01:32:57.437 --> 01:32:59.506
Your phone was buzzing.

01:33:05.278 --> 01:33:07.213
It's from Cirk.

01:33:07.247 --> 01:33:09.916
"Wish you were here."

01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:19.192
Nice.

01:33:19.225 --> 01:33:21.261
You got about ten minutes.

01:34:39.205 --> 01:34:41.140
Good game.

01:34:41.174 --> 01:34:42.575
Good game, man.

01:36:07.427 --> 01:36:09.095
I need a minute.

01:36:17.537 --> 01:36:19.372
What's going on?

01:36:21.374 --> 01:36:23.242
Floor.

01:36:31.751 --> 01:36:33.921
Thanks for joining me
here in Rockville, Virginia.

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.755
Ryan Choi
with Eleven Alive News.

01:36:35.788 --> 01:36:39.192
We are currently on the scene
of Major John Gordo's home.

01:36:39.225 --> 01:36:40.660
Now, what we do know is that

01:36:40.693 --> 01:36:42.729
there has been
a unidentified suspect

01:36:42.762 --> 01:36:45.632
that was armed
with a pellet pistol.

01:36:45.665 --> 01:36:48.401
The suspect fired and missed.

01:36:48.434 --> 01:36:51.604
Major Gordo returned fire,
killing the suspect.

01:36:51.638 --> 01:36:54.474
Earlier today,
I spoke with Major Gordo.

01:36:54.507 --> 01:36:56.309
You purchase security

01:36:56.342 --> 01:36:58.244
thinking something like this
might happen,

01:36:58.277 --> 01:37:01.247
but you don't think
it ever will.

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.783
In other news, a fire
in the warehouse district

01:37:03.816 --> 01:37:06.386
of suspicious origin.

01:37:06.419 --> 01:37:08.454
Four fire companies responded.

01:37:08.488 --> 01:37:10.289
There were no
reported injuries,

01:37:10.323 --> 01:37:12.225
and the fire was brought
under control

01:37:12.258 --> 01:37:14.962
after roughly 90 minutes.

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:18.164
Fire investigators
are on the scene.

01:39:39.438 --> 01:39:41.607
It's turned off.

01:39:55.588 --> 01:39:57.557
Come sit down, John.

01:39:58.658 --> 01:40:00.593
Don't be stupid.

01:40:24.617 --> 01:40:26.452
You remember me?

01:40:26.485 --> 01:40:27.921
Should I?

01:40:30.456 --> 01:40:32.692
Tier 1A, Abu Ghraib.

01:40:35.461 --> 01:40:36.897
Tillich?

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:39.900
Bill Tillich.

01:40:42.635 --> 01:40:45.771
You look pretty good,
all things considered.

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:50.177
How long were you
in Leavenworth?

01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:52.745
- Eight and a half years.
- That's a bitch.

01:40:58.952 --> 01:41:01.787
That boy that you shot...

01:41:03.623 --> 01:41:05.725
...he wanted to kill you.

01:41:05.758 --> 01:41:07.593
I assumed that.

01:41:09.595 --> 01:41:12.565
You trained his father...

01:41:12.598 --> 01:41:14.935
his name was Roger Baufort...

01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:17.004
just like you trained me.

01:41:18.671 --> 01:41:21.440
What happened to him?

01:41:21.474 --> 01:41:23.476
He shot himself.

01:41:25.078 --> 01:41:27.747
So I'm to blame?

01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:30.783
That's a pussified defense,
PFC Tillich,

01:41:30.816 --> 01:41:32.785
and you know it.

01:41:32.818 --> 01:41:36.489
We are each responsible
for our own actions.

01:41:39.692 --> 01:41:41.727
I believe that.

01:41:44.563 --> 01:41:47.800
We are going to go
into the next room,

01:41:47.834 --> 01:41:49.836
you and I...

01:41:51.570 --> 01:41:54.440
...and we are going to have
a dramatic reenactment.

01:41:56.977 --> 01:41:59.712
Only one of us
will come out alive.

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:04.583
I'm going to make things right.

01:42:06.652 --> 01:42:09.455
Either that, John Rodgers...

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:13.260
...or I'm going to blast
a bullet

01:42:13.293 --> 01:42:15.561
straight through your eyeball.

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:34.714
Lead the way.

01:42:34.747 --> 01:42:36.649
After you.

01:42:46.126 --> 01:42:48.594
I got some cigarettes.
Do you want one?

01:42:48.627 --> 01:42:50.563
No.

01:42:50.596 --> 01:42:52.866
Neither do I.

01:42:52.899 --> 01:42:54.868
Who goes first?

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:57.971
Me.

01:44:02.969 --> 01:44:05.038
Emergency services?

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:09.976
I'd like to report a homicide.

01:44:12.112 --> 01:44:14.680
290 Great Falls Road.

01:44:50.749 --> 01:44:52.119
<i>I never imagined myself</i>

01:44:52.152 --> 01:44:55.188
<i>as someone suited
to a life of incarceration.</i>

01:44:59.259 --> 01:45:00.994
Inmate Tillich.

01:45:01.027 --> 01:45:02.795
You got a visitor.
