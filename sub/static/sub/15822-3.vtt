01:34.420 --> 01:35.380
Michelle clark – 

01:35.380 --> 01:36.720
16 years old.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.800
She didn't answer when she was called for breakfast this morning, 

01:38.800 --> 01:41.360
so her father came upstairs to wake her, 

01:41.360 --> 01:43.260
found his daughter hanging from the ceiling, 

01:43.260 --> 01:45.390
cut her down with scissors.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.160
And the parents heard...

01:48.160 --> 01:49.050
nothing during the night, 

01:49.050 --> 01:50.820
but their bedroom's on the other side of the house.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.360
Chief johnson, can I have a word?

01:52.360 --> 01:53.830
-Uh, I'll be right there.
-Chief?

01:53.830 --> 01:54.860
Y-yeah.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.790
Sanchez and daniels have taken the parents into the kitchen 

01:57.790 --> 01:59.000
so they don't have to watch their daughter

01:59.000 --> 02:01.140
get hauled out of here on a gurney.

02:01.140 --> 02:03.450
And flynn's calling michelle's friends, 

02:03.450 --> 02:05.100
just to try and find out 

02:05.100 --> 02:09.130
if she was as happy as her father described.
-Okay.

02:09.130 --> 02:14.170
Buzz, memorialize the crime scene.Thank you.

02:15.980 --> 02:17.800
I want to thank you for coming down.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.410
I, uh, need a fresh pair of eyes on this.

02:20.410 --> 02:21.900
On what, exactly?

02:21.900 --> 02:24.210
Uh, it's, uh, it's sensitive.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.010
Commander, I'm -- I'm happy to help.

02:26.010 --> 02:30.400
I'm just not sure why you need my division to investigate a suicide.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.660
Could you come with me a moment, please?

02:40.580 --> 02:44.160
Now, uh, your mother is just outside.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.390
She's welcome to join us any time you like.

02:47.390 --> 02:48.420
Or your father.

02:48.420 --> 02:52.150
No.No, please.

02:52.150 --> 02:55.910
I don't want my dad to know anything about this.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.770
Okay.It's okay.

02:57.770 --> 03:00.110
We can handle that.

03:00.110 --> 03:03.600
Now, um I looked over the interview 

03:03.600 --> 03:07.040
you gave during your medical exam yesterday, 

03:07.040 --> 03:12.450
and it says your assailant invited you to his home.

03:12.450 --> 03:14.030
Is that correct?

03:14.890 --> 03:17.470
So, this is someone you knew,

03:17.470 --> 03:22.360
someone you considered a friend?

03:22.610 --> 03:25.190
I liked him.

03:25.190 --> 03:27.600
I did.

03:29.030 --> 03:33.030
It says you talked and watched some tv.

03:33.030 --> 03:35.670
Then what happened?

03:38.470 --> 03:40.400
He had these pills, 

03:40.400 --> 03:44.300
and he wanted me to take one.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.300
Drugs.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.780
What kind?

03:46.780 --> 03:48.150
Ecstasy.

03:48.150 --> 03:50.590
I had never tried it before.

03:50.590 --> 03:53.260
-I swear.
-Uh-huh.

03:53.260 --> 03:56.870
I was so scared, but...

03:56.870 --> 04:00.930
he said he wanted...to be...

04:01.420 --> 04:03.300
my boyfriend.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.120
He said...

04:13.470 --> 04:17.870
Michelle, is this a person you know from school?

04:18.649 --> 04:21.480
Can you tell me his name?

04:26.530 --> 04:29.330
What happened to you is not your fault.

04:29.330 --> 04:32.570
I want you to know that.

04:32.570 --> 04:36.570
Now, I spoke to gail, the nurse who examined you.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.630
And she said that during your exam, 

04:38.630 --> 04:44.500
it was suggested that somehow your attacker might be related to a law-enforcement officer.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.610
Is that true?

04:48.510 --> 04:50.210
Michelle, if there's a boy out there 

04:50.210 --> 04:56.420
who would do this terrible thing to you hiding behind a badge, 

04:56.420 --> 04:59.600
I need to stop him.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.220
I'll tell you -- I'll tell you what.

05:01.220 --> 05:03.740
Let's try this.

05:03.740 --> 05:06.090
You just say his name 

05:06.090 --> 05:08.940
one time......

05:08.940 --> 05:12.610
and I'll handle the rest.Can you do that?

05:16.450 --> 05:19.080
Darren.

05:19.430 --> 05:22.320
Darren yates.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.910
"Yates"?

05:25.910 --> 05:28.260
Isn't there someone real high up in the sheriff's department?

05:28.260 --> 05:30.140
Commander mark yates.

05:30.140 --> 05:35.470
That's, uh, that's darren's father.

05:35.690 --> 05:38.320
Uh, buzz, could you leave us alone for a moment, please?

05:38.320 --> 05:40.580
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

05:41.420 --> 05:44.240
And, uh, nothing you heard here leaves this room.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.000
I understand.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.300
Thank you.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.370
-I'm gonna ask you a few questions.
-Okay.

05:57.370 --> 05:58.770
We have rape detectives.

05:58.770 --> 06:02.240
Why wouldn't one of them taken michelle's statement instead of you?

06:02.240 --> 06:06.040
Since I heard that the attacker might have something to do with law enforcement, 

06:06.040 --> 06:09.530
I thought I'd be in a better position to keep the case from being covered up.

06:09.530 --> 06:10.840
So you believed her statement?

06:10.840 --> 06:12.490
Oh, yes.Yes, I did.

06:12.490 --> 06:14.930
Because it's been a week since this interview, 

06:14.930 --> 06:17.500
and you haven't filed any charges against this darren kid.

06:17.500 --> 06:20.180
Well, they took semen samples off of michelle.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.470
I had to get something off the boy without his knowing about it, 

06:23.470 --> 06:25.480
and I was waiting for a dna match.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.850
Then the boy's father -- 

06:26.850 --> 06:29.120
he called me yesterday screaming.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.090
Why?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.710
Someone at the lab tipped off yates 

06:32.710 --> 06:37.660
that I had made a positive dna match to his boy off michelle's rape kit.

06:37.660 --> 06:40.020
And if yates could come at me like he did, 

06:40.020 --> 06:43.330
that -- that might explain what happened to this girl, 

06:43.330 --> 06:46.730
which is why I should turn this case over to you, 

06:46.730 --> 06:49.050
why I sought out your opinion.

06:49.050 --> 06:51.320
Okay, you want my opinion?

06:51.320 --> 06:53.100
Here it is.

06:53.100 --> 06:56.320
You slow-walked this case in a way you never would have even considered doing 

06:56.320 --> 06:59.240
if the suspect hadn't been a relative of a sheriff's commander.

06:59.240 --> 07:02.140
In addition, you left your victim exposed to her attacker, 

07:02.140 --> 07:04.180
who is at school with her on a daily basis, 

07:04.180 --> 07:09.500
while you busied yourself with the political implications of this investigation.

07:09.500 --> 07:14.170
The result is a physically and emotionally traumatized girl who killed herself.

07:14.170 --> 07:15.450
And speaking frankly, commander, 

07:15.450 --> 07:17.820
I just don't know how or why

07:17.820 --> 07:19.890
you think that i could straighten out this mess for you.

07:19.890 --> 07:20.950
Speaking frankly, chief, 

07:20.950 --> 07:26.490
you're the last person on earth I'd ever ask to cover my ass.

07:26.490 --> 07:27.400
All right.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.970
That's a good point.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.600
So, what are you asking for?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.960
Let's say everything you said about me is true.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.440
That doesn't change what happened to this girl.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.770
And as daniels could explain to you, 

07:39.770 --> 07:42.400
that even though there were witnesses, 

07:42.400 --> 07:43.940
I no longer have a victim, 

07:43.940 --> 07:47.540
which means I no longer have a case.

07:47.540 --> 07:50.480
But I think you might.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.170
The alarm at michelle's house wasn't set last night, 

07:53.170 --> 07:55.830
and it looked to me like there were signs of a struggle.

07:55.830 --> 07:58.030
And I think if you just go to the morgue and look – 

07:58.030 --> 07:58.980
I've seen the body.

07:58.980 --> 08:02.170
Well, look again!

08:03.470 --> 08:06.410
I'm sorry.

08:06.410 --> 08:09.850
Please.I, uh...

08:09.850 --> 08:12.170
I know I don't deserve it, brenda, 

08:12.170 --> 08:16.260
but I'm asking that you just go and examine the body.

08:16.260 --> 08:23.760
Just -- just make sure this isn't your case.

08:29.470 --> 08:30.200
I'm telling you, 

08:30.200 --> 08:31.280
it's suicide.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.220
You're 100% sure?

08:33.220 --> 08:35.610
Are you suggesting someone broke into her house, 

08:35.610 --> 08:38.880
drugged her, and hung her from the ceiling?

08:39.220 --> 08:40.390
What happened here?

08:40.390 --> 08:43.419
Oh, those marks were several days old.

08:43.419 --> 08:45.100
On this wrist, too.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.710
From handcuffs or some such thing.

08:48.710 --> 08:53.340
-You know she was raped last week.
-Yes.

08:53.340 --> 08:56.790
Looks like she was restrained during the sexual assault.

08:56.790 --> 08:59.570
She tried pretty hard to get free.

08:59.570 --> 09:05.180
We also have carpet burns on her legs......

09:05.180 --> 09:08.530
like she was forced onto her knees, 

09:08.530 --> 09:12.100
and severe tearing of the vaginal wall.

09:12.100 --> 09:16.040
Bruising on the buttocks from a forcefully used flat hand, 

09:16.040 --> 09:19.830
and there was a fissure in her...

09:19.830 --> 09:21.250
how much of this do you want to know?

09:21.250 --> 09:23.990
All of it.

09:35.090 --> 09:36.740
Sorry, pretty terrible, 

09:36.740 --> 09:42.030
but all done days before she died.

09:43.720 --> 09:46.740
I'd appreciate it if, before you make your final determination, 

09:46.740 --> 09:49.760
that you do a tox screen for me, please.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.160
What would I be looking for?

09:52.160 --> 09:55.390
Ambien, barbiturates, valium, tranquilizers.

09:55.390 --> 09:58.100
You know what?Do a complete workup for me, please.

09:58.100 --> 10:01.950
I don't want to leave anything out.

10:07.460 --> 10:10.900
Uh, chief, I'm not sure I understand.

10:10.900 --> 10:11.890
Understand what?

10:11.890 --> 10:15.590
Cases involving non-stranger rape are incredibly difficult to prove.

10:15.590 --> 10:17.620
Lawyers will say she dated the boy, 

10:17.620 --> 10:19.540
that the sex was consensual, 

10:19.540 --> 10:21.430
and that the boy broke up with her afterwards.

10:21.430 --> 10:25.410
Michelle got mad, tried to get even by accusing him of rape, 

10:25.410 --> 10:29.980
and then, being emotionally unstable, michelle killed herself.

10:29.980 --> 10:32.200
I'm sure they will say that, yes.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.290
And with the victim dead, 

10:33.290 --> 10:36.470
it's gonna be next to impossible to get her statement entered into trial.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.580
We won't get a rape conviction out of this ever.

10:39.580 --> 10:41.050
Well, that's okay, detective, 

10:41.050 --> 10:43.030
because we're not investigating her rape.

10:43.030 --> 10:45.820
We're investigating her murder.

10:53.530 --> 10:56.730
?????T make sense not to notify me 

10:56.730 --> 10:59.370
that com ates' son is being investigated for rape?

10:59.370 --> 11:01.060
Actually, chief, now it's murder.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.770
Well, yeah, I figured that, since you're here.

11:02.770 --> 11:03.950
When was that decision made?

11:03.950 --> 11:05.890
A couple hours ago.

11:05.890 --> 11:08.020
I thought it looked like this girl was a suicide.

11:08.020 --> 11:08.990
"Looks like." 

11:08.990 --> 11:09.760
You weren't at the crime scene.

11:09.760 --> 11:13.550
Even the coroner remains undetermined as to cause of death.

11:13.550 --> 11:14.450
What's he waiting for?

11:14.450 --> 11:17.330
Tox results, and, in additionto the physical evidence...

11:17.330 --> 11:18.840
which is slight....

11:18.840 --> 11:20.210
The victim didn't leave a note.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.660
Am I supposed to stand aside when the evidence is slight 

11:22.660 --> 11:24.800
just because the suspect is related to – 

11:24.800 --> 11:25.950
stop right there.

11:25.950 --> 11:30.610
I am not advocating that we hide behind the blue line.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.220
We're gonna tell them that all we're doing is fulfilling our legal obligation, 

11:34.220 --> 11:35.540
and that in view of that, 

11:35.540 --> 11:38.200
we need this investigation to be beyond reproach.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.840
And not a word to the press.Understood?

11:41.840 --> 11:44.730
-Absolutely.
-Yes, sir.

11:45.850 --> 11:47.450
If the commander here had picked up the phone, 

11:47.450 --> 11:49.460
I could have cleared up this whole mess myself.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.740
But you understand our need to conduct this investigation 

11:51.740 --> 11:54.430
without the appearance of preferential treatment.

11:54.430 --> 11:55.910
I'm happy to confirm that, 

11:55.910 --> 11:59.010
considering that you risk stigmatizing my son's entire future 

11:59.010 --> 12:00.370
on a bogus claim from a girl – 

12:00.370 --> 12:03.830
the charge is not bogus.

12:03.830 --> 12:05.630
Then why didn't you make an arrest?

12:05.630 --> 12:08.980
Because that and other investigations are ongoing.

12:08.980 --> 12:12.360
Are you telling me there's more than one investigation involving my son?

12:12.360 --> 12:14.300
Ask him how many investigations there ought to be, 

12:14.300 --> 12:15.690
and I'll see how close we are.

12:15.690 --> 12:19.340
If this is your idea of how fellow professionals are supposed to be treated, 

12:19.340 --> 12:20.770
I'm a little confused.

12:20.770 --> 12:23.070
Well, let me ask a few questions and clear the air.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.220
Darren, can you account for your whereabouts last night?

12:25.220 --> 12:26.050
Yeah, I was out with – 

12:26.050 --> 12:28.070
do not answer that question.

12:28.070 --> 12:29.230
You say nothing.

12:29.230 --> 12:31.580
Not a word.

12:32.070 --> 12:34.830
My son was with me last night, doing his homework, 

12:34.830 --> 12:36.480
and he was not involved in – 

12:36.480 --> 12:38.740
whatever her name was -- this girl's suicide.

12:38.740 --> 12:42.210
We're not calling it suicide here, mark.

12:42.210 --> 12:44.560
Sorry.

12:44.980 --> 12:46.450
Y-you have evidence of murder?

12:46.450 --> 12:47.280
Let me talk to your son.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.920
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

12:48.920 --> 12:49.720
This is crazy.

12:49.720 --> 12:50.650
I didn't do anything.

12:50.650 --> 12:52.980
What did I say?!

12:52.980 --> 12:56.390
You sit here and shut up!

12:57.830 --> 12:59.340
Now, you listen to me, honey.

12:59.340 --> 13:00.910
This is ridiculous.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.040
That girl was upset and vindictive.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.150
And she told a bunch of lies about darren because he broke up with her.

13:06.150 --> 13:08.570
He broke up pretty hard, sir.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.910
I bring you these photographs of michelle clark, 

13:10.910 --> 13:14.120
courtesy of the nurse who performed the rape exam.

13:14.120 --> 13:19.310
Look at them closely, sir, because they do not look bogus to me.

13:23.050 --> 13:26.930
You have anything to say about this, commander yates?

13:28.770 --> 13:30.020
Yeah.

13:30.020 --> 13:32.570
We're through here.

13:32.570 --> 13:35.270
If you were going to make an arrest, you would have done it already.

13:35.270 --> 13:38.970
And to think I came down here today expecting an apology.

13:38.970 --> 13:41.370
Well, I am sorry for you, sir.

13:41.370 --> 13:43.860
And that's a fact.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.600
You're every bit the bitch I heard you were.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.350
Move it.

13:58.570 --> 13:59.630
Michelle clark – 

13:59.630 --> 14:00.630
high-school junior.

14:00.630 --> 14:03.060
Got straight a-pluses in tough courses, too.

14:03.060 --> 14:06.600
Mom's a stay-at-home, and dad's an airline pilot.

14:06.600 --> 14:10.100
Lieutenant tao, did you find anything resembling a suicide note on her computer?

14:10.100 --> 14:14.880
Uh, no, but I did find a partial footprint on her windowsill – 

14:14.880 --> 14:16.760
top half of a man's sneaker.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.280
Prove it was put there last night.

14:18.280 --> 14:18.920
Exactly.

14:18.920 --> 14:22.440
And S.I.D. came back about the broken mirror and bookshelves in michelle's bedroom.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.220
Their best guess is that when she stepped off the chair, 

14:25.220 --> 14:26.670
she panicked, kicked it all down.

14:26.670 --> 14:28.410
Last-minute change of heart.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.260
That's one explanation, lieutenant.

14:30.260 --> 14:33.800
The other is that she was fighting off an attacker.

14:34.750 --> 14:38.240
Uh, chief, I think what the lieutenant is saying is 

14:38.240 --> 14:41.220
that we're not clear michelle's death was a homicide.

14:41.220 --> 14:43.180
Thank you for the translation, sergeant, 

14:43.180 --> 14:46.630
but I see the murder just fine.

14:49.470 --> 14:51.220
Detective sanchez.

14:51.220 --> 14:55.470
We found seven calls made to michelle's cell from darren since the rape – 

14:55.470 --> 14:57.370
all yesterday afternoon.

14:57.370 --> 14:58.490
Found out about the dna match, 

14:58.490 --> 14:59.870
wanted to keep her quiet.

14:59.870 --> 15:01.870
Which brings us to darren yates—

15:01.870 --> 15:04.090
senior class secretary, b-plus student, 

15:04.090 --> 15:07.050
well-rounded, well-liked, regular prince of a fellow.

15:07.050 --> 15:10.000
There's no record of any bad behavior whatsoever.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.720
No record maybe, but we do have a recording.

15:14.320 --> 15:17.250
A friend in the sheriff's department just slid me this.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.960
-May I?
-Yes.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.920
On march 18th of this year, 

15:20.920 --> 15:25.390
a deputy responded to a sexual-assault call involving a teenage girl 

15:25.390 --> 15:29.530
in a car very near darren's school.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.210
Yeah, the suspect in question – 

15:33.210 --> 15:34.570
he's a pretty big fish, 

15:34.570 --> 15:36.520
so I'm not sure how to handle the situation.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.990
Does the girl want to press charges?

15:37.990 --> 15:39.380
No, sir, that's a negative.

15:39.380 --> 15:41.730
All right, then, I won't send anybody else out there.

15:41.730 --> 15:44.650
Just release the kid with a warning, and don't write anything up.

15:44.650 --> 15:46.270
Got it.

15:47.430 --> 15:50.730
If we go to the sheriff's department and ask about this recording...

15:50.730 --> 15:52.240
they'll deny it's theirs.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.970
And without being able to identify the voices, 

15:53.970 --> 15:56.580
it's just two people talking on a radio.It is not evidence.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.730
No, it's evidence, sergeant.

15:57.730 --> 15:59.280
It's just not admissible in court.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.830
A sheriff's commander would know that.

16:04.210 --> 16:08.040
But I bet his son wouldn'T.

16:08.890 --> 16:10.540
Listen, 

16:10.540 --> 16:12.370
I'm trying to put this case together in such a way 

16:12.370 --> 16:14.760
that it ends with a confession, not a trial.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.310
And I see the obstacles as clearly as y'all.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.290
But I would appreciate it 

16:18.290 --> 16:21.050
if the detectives in my own division would offer me 

16:21.050 --> 16:25.230
at least the same support I'm getting from commander taylor.

16:25.420 --> 16:28.270
Thank you.Now, 

16:28.270 --> 16:30.090
that footprint on the windowsill -- 

16:30.090 --> 16:33.210
I think that, along with the dna match from the rape kit -- 

16:33.210 --> 16:36.340
that almost buys me a search warrant of the yates house.

16:36.340 --> 16:39.160
So, let's find one more thing to convince the judge.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.200
Thank you.

16:43.810 --> 16:48.580
He hit me like i was a horse.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.180
And his friends -- 

16:52.180 --> 16:55.090
they were in the next room.

16:55.090 --> 16:58.580
Tony, danny, and tim.

16:58.580 --> 17:03.250
And maybe even kevin.

17:03.250 --> 17:06.210
I could hear them laughing...

17:06.210 --> 17:08.099
when he...

17:08.099 --> 17:10.349
finished.

17:10.349 --> 17:14.440
And now, when they look at me at school, 

17:14.440 --> 17:16.180
they pretend to...

17:16.180 --> 17:20.250
paw at the ground.

17:20.250 --> 17:24.540
And they make these noises.

17:34.930 --> 17:38.180
Well, that's pretty rough stuff.

17:38.180 --> 17:39.690
Raping her with his friends in the next room, 

17:39.690 --> 17:42.970
and no one stopped him?

17:42.970 --> 17:46.940
You'd think I'd be used to this kind of thing by now.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.260
Did you look at my notes?

17:50.260 --> 17:52.550
Yeah, I did.

17:52.550 --> 17:54.150
Well, but...

17:54.150 --> 17:56.680
doesn't that shoeprint say anything to you?

17:56.680 --> 17:59.700
Well...it says at some point in time, 

17:59.700 --> 18:00.910
someone stood on her windowsill -- 

18:00.910 --> 18:03.340
not that they went inside.

18:03.340 --> 18:05.240
There's no way to say when it was left there.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.560
I mean, it's not proof.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.440
And the father gives him an alibi.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.820
Boy, would I like to take that alibi and pound him over the head with it.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.470
I don't believe it for a second.

18:14.470 --> 18:16.510
Well, homicide's not my specialty.

18:16.510 --> 18:19.400
Maybe that's why I'm not seeing it.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.260
To me, it's obvious.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.030
But then I saw the body.

18:27.350 --> 18:30.490
Yeah, the rape seems solid.

18:31.430 --> 18:34.920
Oh, imagine those other boys just sitting in that next room 

18:34.920 --> 18:40.880
maybe having a beer while a girl is assaulted like that.

18:40.880 --> 18:46.940
Oh, it makes you want to go out and arrest every last one of them, doesn't it?

18:55.310 --> 18:56.830
You know darren's father 

18:56.830 --> 19:00.440
is pretty high up in the sheriff's department?

19:00.440 --> 19:02.940
Yes, ma'am, we are fully aware of that fact.

19:02.940 --> 19:04.540
Believe me.

19:04.540 --> 19:06.100
So, darren's friends...

19:06.100 --> 19:07.040
I'm sorry.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.770
I don't want to turn you away, 

19:08.770 --> 19:12.390
but parents send their children to our academy to protect them.

19:12.390 --> 19:15.100
I assure you the conduct of our young people 

19:15.100 --> 19:16.730
is well above high-school norm.

19:16.730 --> 19:17.870
And with michelle's suicide -- 

19:17.870 --> 19:20.680
well, the students have been through so much already.

19:20.680 --> 19:21.740
Would it be easier for them 

19:21.740 --> 19:26.770
if I told them that michelle was raped and murdered instead?

19:26.770 --> 19:28.760
Look, ms.Patterson, you have two choices-- 

19:28.760 --> 19:30.050
you either cooperate with me, 

19:30.050 --> 19:31.600
or I lock down this school 

19:31.600 --> 19:34.340
and go room to room questioning each individual student 

19:34.340 --> 19:38.100
about their whereabouts on the night of michelle's murder.

19:38.730 --> 19:40.590
You want to know his -- his best friends -- 

19:40.590 --> 19:42.910
the ones he tends to hang out with?

19:42.910 --> 19:44.100
Starting with the first names-- 

19:44.100 --> 19:46.680
tony, danny, tim, and kevin.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.030
Let me try lookit.

19:49.030 --> 19:50.710
-I'm sorry?
-Lookit.Net -- 

19:50.710 --> 19:54.560
It's a social-network site we set up for the school.

19:56.330 --> 19:58.600
This is...

19:58.600 --> 20:00.200
darren's page.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.840
If I click on "best buds," let's see.

20:03.840 --> 20:08.310
Tony -- there's anthony lambert.

20:08.310 --> 20:10.230
What can you tell me about him?

20:10.230 --> 20:12.130
He's 17, a senior here.

20:12.130 --> 20:13.300
Anthony lambert?

20:13.300 --> 20:14.400
You're under arrest.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.990
Average student, some disciplinary issues.

20:16.990 --> 20:17.770
Beat it.

20:17.770 --> 20:18.580
Meaning?

20:18.580 --> 20:22.070
The coach kicked him off the tennis team last season for fighting.

20:22.070 --> 20:24.830
Um, tim swick -- 

20:24.830 --> 20:26.210
also a senior.

20:26.210 --> 20:26.950
Hands behind your head.

20:26.950 --> 20:28.680
Not the most driven, academically.

20:28.680 --> 20:33.720
He was suspended in april for smoking marijuana on school grounds.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.970
Um, daniel dobrowski -- 

20:36.970 --> 20:38.630
a junior.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.420
He's on the basketball team with darren.

20:40.420 --> 20:44.100
Just had him in detention for poor attendance.

20:44.100 --> 20:49.050
Congratulations on the "above-average" behavior of your students.

20:49.740 --> 20:51.040
And kevin ward -- 

20:51.040 --> 20:53.310
a junior, next-door neighbor to darren.

20:53.310 --> 20:54.400
A's and b's mostly.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.230
He's actually a pretty good kid.

20:56.230 --> 21:00.840
Kevin ward, you're under arrest for aiding and abetting a felony.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.370
What?

21:06.910 --> 21:08.980
Darren, my man.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.610
You have a nice day, you hear?

21:15.750 --> 21:18.250
Anthony lambert, tim swick, danny dobrowski -- 

21:18.250 --> 21:21.570
all insist that on the night of the rape they were at the movies.

21:21.570 --> 21:22.490
On the night of the murder, 

21:22.490 --> 21:24.100
they were driving around hollywood.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.780
And they say darren was with them on both occasions.

21:26.780 --> 21:27.480
That's funny.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.010
Mark yates told me that on the night michelle died, 

21:30.010 --> 21:32.520
darren was with him.

21:32.520 --> 21:37.570
I worry when a suspect has extra alibis.

21:37.570 --> 21:39.630
Um, what about kevin here?

21:39.630 --> 21:42.450
Kevin works part-time at a printshop after school.

21:42.450 --> 21:44.780
Boss clears him of both incidents, but...

21:44.780 --> 21:46.160
he won't talk without a lawyer.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.380
He's a witness, not a suspect.

21:47.380 --> 21:48.950
He has no right to an attorney.

21:48.950 --> 21:50.980
I explained that to him, chief.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.980
She did -- over and over.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.170
I think kevin is afraid 

21:54.170 --> 21:57.270
because we told him we'd put him in a jail cell for the afternoon.

21:57.270 --> 21:58.320
That was the point, commander.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.890
I wanted him to be afraid.

21:59.890 --> 22:02.070
How much longer can we hold him before calling his parents?

22:02.070 --> 22:03.290
Maybe an hour.

22:03.290 --> 22:06.720
Three if you let me accidentally send him to harper division first.

22:06.720 --> 22:07.950
No.

22:07.950 --> 22:10.570
He asked for a lawyer...

22:11.360 --> 22:14.260
we'll give him one.

22:15.940 --> 22:16.830
Kevin?

22:16.830 --> 22:17.950
Kevin ward?

22:17.950 --> 22:19.370
Yeah?

22:19.370 --> 22:23.060
I'm brenda leigh johnson from the public defender's office.

22:23.060 --> 22:25.920
The police told me that you were smart enough to ask for an attorney.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.630
Oh, my god.

22:27.630 --> 22:30.640
They kept telling me that I didn't have the right to a lawyer.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.970
You cannot trust the police.

22:31.970 --> 22:34.680
They lie about everything.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.460
Listen, don't you worry your little head one more moment about these cops.

22:37.460 --> 22:38.500
'Cause once I walk out of here, 

22:38.500 --> 22:41.270
they are all gonna answer to me.

22:41.270 --> 22:42.450
All right.

22:42.450 --> 22:45.210
Uh, wait a minute, though.

22:45.210 --> 22:47.340
How -- how much do you cost?

22:47.340 --> 22:49.080
Oh, that's darling.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.450
Aren't you sweet?

22:50.450 --> 22:52.870
Can she do this?

22:52.870 --> 22:56.020
As long as he doesn't say anything they need to prosecute him for.

22:56.020 --> 22:57.760
Don't you worry about the money.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.800
The state pays my tab.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.290
Besides, I think they're after another boy.

23:02.290 --> 23:03.550
Yeah.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.560
Darren yates.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.130
That's him.

23:06.130 --> 23:08.130
Did they tell you why?

23:10.420 --> 23:12.440
Well, I don't -- I don't want to get anyone in trouble.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.050
Oh, bless your heart.

23:14.050 --> 23:17.070
Most folks can't wait to point the finger at someone else.

23:18.060 --> 23:20.480
Listen.Let me explain how this works.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.550
Everything you say to your lawyer is completely confidential, 

23:23.550 --> 23:26.900
which means that I have to keep it a secret.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.760
But in order to help you, 

23:28.760 --> 23:31.860
I need you to tell me everything.

23:32.310 --> 23:36.480
So, what have the police been talking to you about?

23:36.480 --> 23:37.340
Okay.

23:37.340 --> 23:39.630
Um, well, there's this girl -- 

23:39.630 --> 23:41.570
michelle clark.

23:41.570 --> 23:43.970
I guess she hung herself.

23:43.970 --> 23:45.430
"Hanged" herself?

23:45.430 --> 23:46.880
Hanged -- hanged herself.

23:46.880 --> 23:47.500
No, no.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.110
Uh, the clark girl.

23:49.110 --> 23:51.310
She was murdered.

23:51.310 --> 23:52.240
"Murdered"?

23:52.240 --> 23:54.160
The police didn't tell you that?

23:54.160 --> 23:56.370
Oh!Unbelievable.

23:56.370 --> 23:59.220
I hate it when they manipulate children like this, 

23:59.220 --> 24:02.030
and with your entire future hanging by a thread.

24:02.030 --> 24:03.360
Unbelievable.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.810
Listen, kevin, I want you to brace yourself, 

24:06.810 --> 24:09.190
'cause the police consider you a suspect 

24:09.190 --> 24:13.670
in both the rape and murder of michelle clark.

24:13.670 --> 24:15.110
No!What?!

24:15.110 --> 24:15.900
No!What?!

24:15.900 --> 24:17.290
No!No.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.880
I-I never even spoke to michelle, okay?

24:19.880 --> 24:22.750
Darren's the one that had sex with her, not me.

24:22.750 --> 24:23.930
He told you that?

24:23.930 --> 24:24.870
Yeah.

24:24.870 --> 24:25.750
Well, he sort of told everybody 

24:25.750 --> 24:29.320
when he put michelle's picture up on his lookit page.

24:29.320 --> 24:31.800
Why would he post her picture?

24:32.360 --> 24:34.290
kevin...

24:34.290 --> 24:38.590
I can't defend you unless I know everything.

24:40.040 --> 24:44.020
-It's this game.
-Okay.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.450
We called it "cherry picking." 

24:47.450 --> 24:48.730
Never heard of it.

24:48.730 --> 24:51.470
That's 'cause we made it up.

24:51.690 --> 24:58.660
See, we -- we each put in 50 bucks to see who could, 

24:58.660 --> 25:03.720
you know, s-sleep with the most virgins this year.

25:04.150 --> 25:05.500
And, uh...

25:05.500 --> 25:06.960
I get it.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.760
and whoever picks the most cherries...

25:08.760 --> 25:10.130
wins the pot.

25:10.130 --> 25:12.200
Yeah.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.720
Well, boys will be boys.

25:15.920 --> 25:19.460
And, uh, michelle was one of darren's cherries?

25:19.460 --> 25:20.400
Yeah.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.900
But darren had to work it -- 

25:21.900 --> 25:24.430
you know, pretend he was all in love with her, 

25:24.430 --> 25:26.120
took her on a few dates -- 

25:26.120 --> 25:29.030
and he could push it a little bit harder than the rest of us.

25:29.030 --> 25:29.950
Why?

25:29.950 --> 25:33.170
Because his dad's this big deal in the sheriff's department.

25:33.170 --> 25:36.420
You know, that's how darren gets away with all of this stuff, 

25:36.420 --> 25:39.980
like the time that he got caught with "x" when he was speeding.

25:39.980 --> 25:41.640
They just let him go.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.230
And with these girls, like michelle, 

25:43.230 --> 25:49.240
he just, you know, took a few shortcuts.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.230
He said he got a couple of girls that way.

25:52.990 --> 25:56.500
They're still posted on his webpage.

25:58.260 --> 25:59.930
Darren's lookit page.

25:59.930 --> 26:01.700
Scrolling down.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.980
And...

26:03.980 --> 26:09.460
here's a bunch of pictures of girls.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.570
Four rows of three.

26:13.570 --> 26:18.050
Dated -- tagged with little cherry icons.

26:18.050 --> 26:19.820
That one -- ally.

26:19.820 --> 26:21.990
March 18th.

26:21.990 --> 26:24.430
On the recording that we got from the sheriff's department, 

26:24.430 --> 26:27.340
what night did the deputy report finding a "big fish" 

26:27.340 --> 26:28.940
involved in a sexual assault?

26:28.940 --> 26:30.680
March 18th.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.870
Lieutenant tao, would you print out this picture for me, please?

26:32.870 --> 26:33.620
Sure.

26:33.620 --> 26:35.480
Detective sanchez, sergeant gabriel, 

26:35.480 --> 26:37.480
let's find out who's telling the truth here.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.990
If darren was driving around hollywood with his friends last night, 

26:39.990 --> 26:41.330
I'd like to know about it.

26:41.330 --> 26:43.240
And, lieutenant flynn, 

26:43.240 --> 26:46.440
I believe that we have earned a search warrant for the yates house.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.900
Find me a shoe that matches the tread on the windowsill.

26:48.900 --> 26:49.630
Thank you.

26:49.630 --> 26:51.130
Look, I hate to be a spoilsport here, 

26:51.130 --> 26:53.710
but you asked kevin not one question about murder 

26:53.710 --> 26:55.250
and, as regard to the rape, 

26:55.250 --> 26:56.670
everything he said is hearsay.

26:56.670 --> 26:57.960
He observed nothing.

26:57.960 --> 27:01.300
So you can't charge darren with either crime.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.730
Where does that statement lead us?

27:04.500 --> 27:07.010
To another victim.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.200
Ally.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.950
Ally mitchell?

27:14.950 --> 27:15.870
Hi, ally.

27:15.870 --> 27:19.220
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the L.A.P.D.

27:19.220 --> 27:23.830
Miss johnson would like to ask you a few questions about michelle clark.

27:23.830 --> 27:25.520
I didn't really know her very well, 

27:25.520 --> 27:27.770
and, um, I'm losing my ride home.

27:27.770 --> 27:29.350
I could give you a lift.

27:29.350 --> 27:30.480
It won't take long, 

27:30.480 --> 27:33.760
and I could really use your help.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.210
I knew her mostly from choir our first year, 

27:40.210 --> 27:42.840
but them michelle went hard-core academics.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.100
I'm more of a painter.

27:45.100 --> 27:47.670
So, she was murdered?

27:47.670 --> 27:49.130
But first she was raped...

27:49.130 --> 27:50.410
badly.

27:50.410 --> 27:54.810
Did you ever see michelle with a boy named darren yates?

27:55.230 --> 27:57.730
Um...I don't remember, really.

27:57.730 --> 27:59.960
You need to take a right at the next stop sign.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.100
But you know who darren is, right?

28:02.100 --> 28:03.550
I thought you wanted to ask me about michelle.

28:03.550 --> 28:06.290
About what you and michelle had in common.

28:06.290 --> 28:09.790
For example, she had her picture up on darren's lookit page, too, 

28:09.790 --> 28:11.610
right next to yours, 

28:11.610 --> 28:14.450
which went up some time after march 18th.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.470
I didn't call anyone.

28:17.470 --> 28:19.040
You don't understand!

28:19.040 --> 28:20.510
And you missed my turn!

28:20.510 --> 28:23.110
My house is totally back that way!

28:23.110 --> 28:24.420
Hey!

28:24.420 --> 28:25.170
Where are you going?

28:25.170 --> 28:27.160
Nowhere fast unless you help me.

28:27.160 --> 28:30.300
Listen, ally, michelle thought darren was her new boyfriend.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.930
They went out on a couple of dates, 

28:31.930 --> 28:32.810
he gained her trust, 

28:32.810 --> 28:34.170
and then he handcuffed her 

28:34.170 --> 28:36.240
and raped her on the floor of his house.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.860
Does any of that sound familiar?

28:37.860 --> 28:41.730
It should, because something like that happened to you......

28:47.630 --> 28:49.090
right here.

28:49.090 --> 28:52.000
This is where a sheriff's deputy picked you up on the night of march 18th 

28:52.000 --> 28:53.110
and drove you home, 

28:53.110 --> 28:56.250
while sending darren off with a slap on the wrist.

28:57.690 --> 29:00.240
Now I can't talk to michelle anymore, 

29:00.240 --> 29:01.810
so I need you to help me, 

29:01.810 --> 29:04.860
or else darren's gonna sexually assault another young girl.

29:04.860 --> 29:06.540
Is that what you want?

29:06.540 --> 29:08.460
No.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.750
I just want to forget it ever happened.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.940
So did michelle.

29:15.940 --> 29:18.350
Look what happened to her.

29:26.790 --> 29:28.470
Ally.

29:28.470 --> 29:30.870
Ally?

29:40.330 --> 29:43.250
Ally.

29:51.070 --> 29:55.120
Darren's only the second boy who ever asked me out.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.580
I know.

29:56.580 --> 29:59.920
Hard to believe, huh?

30:00.810 --> 30:03.880
How'd you end up here?

30:09.530 --> 30:11.540
He...

30:11.540 --> 30:14.240
he took me to the movies first.

30:14.240 --> 30:17.690
We hadn't been there very long when he just...

30:17.690 --> 30:21.610
reached over and grabbed my hand.

30:21.610 --> 30:23.560
My heart was beating so fast, 

30:23.560 --> 30:25.210
I thought he would hear it, 

30:25.210 --> 30:30.730
or maybe it would just jump out of my chest.

30:32.160 --> 30:36.530
Afterwards, we went driving for a while, talking.

30:36.530 --> 30:39.160
Then he parked here.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.340
"Just for a minute," he said.

30:42.340 --> 30:45.840
And we kissed.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.760
And while I was thinking, 

30:47.760 --> 30:53.160
"wow, this is what it's like to fall in love," 

30:53.160 --> 30:55.200
he pushed my seat back all the way 

30:55.200 --> 30:58.760
and rolled over on top of me.

30:58.760 --> 31:04.210
By the time I tried to shove him off, he...

31:04.210 --> 31:06.950
h-he already handcuffed my hands behind my back 

31:06.950 --> 31:09.880
and pulled my jeans down.

31:09.880 --> 31:13.360
So I screamed.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.010
But he put his hand over my mouth 

31:15.010 --> 31:17.130
and said that if I'd just shut up, 

31:17.130 --> 31:20.640
I'd enjoy it.

31:20.640 --> 31:24.760
When it was over and I told him I was calling the police, 

31:24.760 --> 31:30.310
he grabbed my phone and started dialing the sheriff's office himself.

31:30.310 --> 31:34.450
And when he hung up, he said -- 

31:34.450 --> 31:38.820
he told me to take a good look in the mirror.

31:38.820 --> 31:40.240
"They're never gonna believe 

31:40.240 --> 31:45.520
that I had to rape someone who looks like you." 

31:45.520 --> 31:48.420
And...he was right.

31:48.420 --> 31:51.990
I mean, I'm not a supermodel.

31:51.990 --> 31:54.500
So I should be, like, grateful, right?

31:54.500 --> 31:56.590
Ally, you're very, very pretty.

31:56.590 --> 32:00.170
Oh, yeah, thanks.I know.

32:01.190 --> 32:03.660
Look.

32:03.930 --> 32:06.810
I know you've been through so much already, 

32:06.810 --> 32:08.110
and it's hard to consider, 

32:08.110 --> 32:10.560
but if you could press charges against darren --

32:10.560 --> 32:13.920
oh, no way!Forget it!Take me home!

32:29.930 --> 32:33.120
I'm not saying it would be easy.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.450
It wouldn'T.

32:35.450 --> 32:37.970
It would be very, very tough.

32:37.970 --> 32:41.400
But I would be with you every step of the way.

32:41.400 --> 32:43.560
I promise.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.430
You could help me stop him.

32:45.430 --> 32:49.240
I tried stopping him once.

32:49.770 --> 32:50.980
I can't do it again.

32:50.980 --> 32:54.240
I can'T.I'm sorry.Here.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.370
No, no, no.

32:55.370 --> 32:58.050
No, don't be sorry.

32:58.600 --> 33:02.380
You've already done enough things you didn't want to do.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.310
Wait a minute.

33:06.310 --> 33:08.180
What?

33:08.900 --> 33:11.940
This uny sweatshirt hanging from the ceiling...

33:11.940 --> 33:13.130
what about it?

33:13.130 --> 33:16.150
Darren got a scholarship to uny.

33:16.860 --> 33:19.790
It's where he's going to college.

33:23.900 --> 33:25.340
Do you really think you're gonna get a confession 

33:25.340 --> 33:27.440
from this kid in front of his father?

33:27.440 --> 33:29.520
Commander yates knows as much about murder investigations 

33:29.520 --> 33:30.730
as anyone in this building.

33:30.730 --> 33:31.910
I counted on that, will.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.500
That's why he's here without an attorney.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.140
He knows that unless I arrest his son, 

33:35.140 --> 33:37.020
they can leave whenever they want, 

33:37.020 --> 33:38.510
which is why I'm trying to find out 

33:38.510 --> 33:41.260
if we were able to break darren's alibi.

33:41.260 --> 33:42.530
So, may I?

33:42.530 --> 33:45.040
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

33:49.610 --> 33:52.110
-So, the story the kid-- 
-shh, shh, shh.

33:52.110 --> 33:55.300
Sorry.The story the kids we arrested told us 

33:55.300 --> 33:56.520
checks out on both sides.

33:56.520 --> 33:57.720
At the time michelle died, 

33:57.720 --> 34:01.340
darren and his best buds were in the hollywood highland area.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.730
We have them on time-coded film at about three different places.

34:04.730 --> 34:06.110
The alibi is solid.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.840
That is exactly what I wanted to hear.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.460
Now, if y'all wouldn't mind waiting here for a minute.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.300
Thank you.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.090
So sorry to keep y'all waiting.

34:15.090 --> 34:16.159
Let us acknowledge, 

34:16.159 --> 34:17.370
just for the sake of the records, 

34:17.370 --> 34:19.179
that your rights have been read to both of you 

34:19.179 --> 34:20.929
and that you have waived those rights 

34:20.929 --> 34:22.270
and are cooperating with us 

34:22.270 --> 34:26.480
in the investigation of the rape and murder of michelle clark.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.929
What, does she think I'm an idiot?

34:28.929 --> 34:31.400
Yes, I was read my rights, as was my son.

34:31.400 --> 34:34.880
Which I would have found to be the most insulting moment of my career 

34:34.880 --> 34:36.440
had it not been for the L.A.P.D.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.310
Executing a search warrant at my home earlier today...

34:39.310 --> 34:41.840
in front of all my neighbors!

34:41.840 --> 34:46.489
No one regrets the necessity of that search more than I, sir.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.600
A-and had you shown the customary cooperation 

34:49.600 --> 34:52.590
one would expect from a fellow law-enforcement officer -- 

34:52.590 --> 34:59.420
you are going to tell me about the respect due fellow officers?

34:59.640 --> 35:00.520
Really?!

35:00.520 --> 35:03.160
Calm down, commander.

35:04.800 --> 35:09.810
Okay, let's forget about respect, duty, and honor here 

35:09.810 --> 35:12.980
because you have all proven that they are bullshit to you.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.740
Now, what I want to know, lady, 

35:14.740 --> 35:19.600
is whether an arrest is going to be made here today or not.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.740
That all depends on -- 

35:20.740 --> 35:21.920
on where your son, darren, 

35:21.920 --> 35:24.890
was the night before last during the time of the murder 

35:24.890 --> 35:28.620
and on our ability to confirm that alibi.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.660
And as I've already told you, 

35:30.660 --> 35:31.800
night before last, 

35:31.800 --> 35:37.560
my son was with me at home.

35:38.610 --> 35:40.010
All right, then.

35:40.010 --> 35:42.260
Um, commander yates, given that, 

35:42.260 --> 35:43.570
if you wouldn't mind stepping outside 

35:43.570 --> 35:46.460
for a quick conference with commander taylor and me, 

35:46.460 --> 35:50.780
I would be able to pass on a little information of a personal nature.

35:51.610 --> 35:57.430
And then I should be able to wrap up this investigation in a matter of minutes.

36:04.130 --> 36:06.610
I'll be right back.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.400
After you, sir.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.470
Oh, no, please.

36:09.470 --> 36:11.680
Thank you.

36:15.080 --> 36:19.360
Does anybody know what's going on here at all?

36:27.490 --> 36:30.250
Hada lot of time in the sheriff's department, commander, 

36:30.250 --> 36:32.680
so I'm sure you'll understand what I'm about to do.

36:32.680 --> 36:34.400
Because the alibi that you provided for your son 

36:34.400 --> 36:36.580
is contradicted by physical evidence.

36:36.580 --> 36:38.150
What are you about to do?

36:38.150 --> 36:42.270
Mark yates, you're under arrest for aiding and abetting a felony after the fact.

36:42.270 --> 36:43.260
Whoa, you can't arrest me!

36:43.260 --> 36:45.910
-Hey, easy!Easy!
-Let me go!

36:45.910 --> 36:47.980
Now, unless you immediately back off, sir, 

36:47.980 --> 36:50.340
I will happily add resisting arrest to this charge -- 

36:50.340 --> 36:51.030
happily!

36:51.030 --> 36:52.540
Do you understand me, sir?!

36:52.540 --> 36:54.850
All right.All right!

36:54.850 --> 36:55.980
Now you got a lawsuit.

36:56.050 --> 36:56.770
Have we?

36:56.770 --> 36:58.130
No.

36:58.130 --> 36:59.830
If you'll excuse me, I need to finish up with darren.

36:59.830 --> 37:01.850
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

37:01.850 --> 37:03.240
I want an attorney for my son.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.510
Your son is 18, sir, 

37:04.510 --> 37:06.260
and legally recognized as an adult.

37:06.260 --> 37:07.500
He has been read his rights 

37:07.500 --> 37:08.850
and waived his right to an attorney.

37:08.850 --> 37:12.350
I demand an attorney for my son, 

37:12.350 --> 37:16.300
or that I'm allowed back in there before any further questioning.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.700
You may not be aware of this, 

37:17.700 --> 37:20.620
but the constitution gives you the right to an attorney, 

37:20.620 --> 37:22.560
not a father.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.400
A lawyer was offered and declined.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.490
Book him, please!

37:25.490 --> 37:27.290
-Thank you.
-Let's go.Let's go, commander!

37:27.290 --> 37:29.500
Darren, don't say anything!

37:29.500 --> 37:31.210
I'm gonna get you for this, I swear!

37:31.210 --> 37:34.240
-Darren!
-Get him outta here!

37:34.240 --> 37:37.030
Do you have enough evidence to make an arrest for murder?

37:37.030 --> 37:38.610
No.

37:38.610 --> 37:41.710
But I'm gonna try and get a confession all the same.

37:46.930 --> 37:48.480
Where's my father?

37:48.480 --> 37:49.850
Sorry about that.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.760
I had to arrest your dad.

37:51.760 --> 37:54.370
He lied about your alibi.

37:54.370 --> 37:56.890
You were out with your best buds the night before last -- 

37:56.890 --> 37:59.410
your fellow cherry-picking friends, weren't you?

37:59.410 --> 38:00.910
You were caught on film a few times 

38:00.910 --> 38:03.590
when your dad said that you were at the house doing homework.

38:03.590 --> 38:04.690
-"Caught on film"?
What?

38:04.690 --> 38:09.030
Guess your father didn't think that your "friends" alibi would hold up.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.130
Look familiar?

38:12.300 --> 38:14.030
They're from your closet.

38:14.030 --> 38:14.800
So what?

38:14.800 --> 38:18.890
So, the tread matches this print that you left on michelle's windowsill 

38:18.890 --> 38:21.440
when you climbed into her room on the night that you killed her.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.230
W-what?

38:22.230 --> 38:23.910
The nightyou strangled her I climbed up there one time 

38:23.910 --> 38:25.760
-and strung her up to make it look like a suicide!
-And she made me leave!

38:25.760 --> 38:27.310
I never did anything like that!

38:27.310 --> 38:29.740
Never!Never!

38:30.900 --> 38:32.330
You got a scholarship to college next year.

38:32.330 --> 38:33.950
Where is it?

38:33.950 --> 38:34.610
Why?

38:34.610 --> 38:36.560
What school?

38:36.560 --> 38:39.730
Uny -- the university of new york.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.480
You recognize this?

38:42.480 --> 38:45.480
That's the sweatshirt you used to hang michelle from the beam in her room.

38:45.480 --> 38:47.320
That's not mine!

38:47.320 --> 38:49.120
It's the same sweatshirt that you're wearing in this picture 

38:49.120 --> 38:50.410
I took from your lookit page, 

38:50.410 --> 38:52.430
right down to the tear in the left-hand pocket.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.850
And if I find your dna on this, darren, 

38:54.850 --> 38:57.810
you're looking at murder in the first degree with special circumstances, 

38:57.810 --> 38:59.590
which carries with it the death penalty!

38:59.590 --> 39:00.210
Wait.Okay.

39:00.210 --> 39:04.110
I gave her that sweatshirt one night when w-we were -- 

39:04.110 --> 39:05.270
after you ripped her clothes off, 

39:05.270 --> 39:07.220
so she'd have something to cover herself up in 

39:07.220 --> 39:09.140
when she went home after you raped her!

39:09.140 --> 39:09.980
We had sex.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.070
She was high.

39:11.070 --> 39:12.890
She tore her clothes when she was taking them off, 

39:12.890 --> 39:14.080
but she wanted it, okay?

39:14.080 --> 39:15.360
She wanted it!

39:15.360 --> 39:16.830
Is that what she wanted?!

39:16.830 --> 39:18.350
Is that what your best buds, 

39:18.350 --> 39:19.500
who've been in lockup all day, 

39:19.500 --> 39:20.820
will say michelle wanted, 

39:20.820 --> 39:23.430
when I charge them with conspiracy to commit murder?

39:23.430 --> 39:25.360
Do you think -- 

39:25.360 --> 39:27.640
are you really dumb enough to believe, 

39:27.640 --> 39:30.500
that your cherry-picking friends are going to trial to cover for you?!

39:30.500 --> 39:31.830
Okay, look.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.860
I was the first person in our entire school 

39:33.860 --> 39:35.390
who even asked michelle out.

39:35.390 --> 39:37.480
Now, I'm sorry about what happened to her.

39:37.480 --> 39:38.820
Maybe I got carried away.

39:38.820 --> 39:41.300
-You call murdergetting carried away?
-I didn't murder her.

39:41.300 --> 39:42.530
Look at these marks!Look at 'em!

39:42.530 --> 39:44.700
That happened over a week before she killed herself!

39:44.700 --> 39:46.280
How do you know how and when she got these marks?!

39:46.280 --> 39:47.930
Because I put them there...

39:47.930 --> 39:50.870
while we were having sex!

39:50.870 --> 39:52.230
But she wanted it.

39:52.230 --> 39:52.900
She wanted it.

39:52.900 --> 39:53.590
She loved me.

39:53.590 --> 39:54.530
That's what she told me.

39:54.530 --> 39:55.640
She loved me.

39:55.640 --> 39:58.560
I have girls throwing themselves at me all the time, 

39:58.560 --> 40:00.030
and if she would've just relaxed, 

40:00.030 --> 40:01.590
if she would've just gone along with it, 

40:01.590 --> 40:02.550
it would've been fine.

40:02.550 --> 40:04.270
So if you want to call that rape, okay, 

40:04.270 --> 40:05.680
maybe she looked at it that way, 

40:05.680 --> 40:08.970
but I didn't kill her!

40:09.220 --> 40:11.110
I know.

40:11.520 --> 40:12.380
"I know"?

40:12.380 --> 40:13.810
Did she just say, "I know"?

40:13.810 --> 40:16.150
I guess without a victim to press charges, 

40:16.150 --> 40:17.810
chief johnson must've seen the only way 

40:17.810 --> 40:19.620
to make a sexual assault stick 

40:19.620 --> 40:22.350
was if darren confessed to it.

40:23.470 --> 40:25.110
You're telling me this whole murder investigation 

40:25.110 --> 40:29.150
was some kind of strategy to get the kid to confess to the rape?

40:29.150 --> 40:30.770
Oh, I wouldn't know, sir.

40:30.770 --> 40:34.290
Chief johnson doesn't confide in me.

40:35.090 --> 40:36.820
You know that I didn'T...

40:36.820 --> 40:37.610
kill michelle?

40:37.610 --> 40:39.940
Is that what you're saying?

40:39.940 --> 40:42.660
As hard as it is for me to accept, 

40:42.880 --> 40:45.280
you are not liable for her death.

40:45.420 --> 40:49.110
The justice system will just have to be satisfied with the rape charge.

40:49.110 --> 40:49.870
Hold on here.

40:49.870 --> 40:50.410
Wait a minute.

40:50.410 --> 40:51.140
Does this mean that I -- 

40:51.140 --> 40:54.560
you're under arrest for the sexual assault of michelle clark.

40:54.560 --> 40:58.380
And if you think that being the son of a sheriff's commander 

40:58.380 --> 41:00.160
made you popular at school, 

41:00.160 --> 41:02.790
just wait until you get to prison.

41:03.010 --> 41:06.920
Convicts even play some of the same games as you and your best buds.

41:06.920 --> 41:09.000
I imagine you'll end up in their 

41:09.000 --> 41:13.830
cherry-picking club in no time at all.

41:17.860 --> 41:19.860
Goodbye, darren.

41:19.860 --> 41:22.650
My father is never gonna let this happen.Never!

41:22.650 --> 41:24.100
Do you hear me?

41:24.100 --> 41:26.200
Never!!

41:33.170 --> 41:35.070
Commander.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.760
I wanted to say "thank you." 

41:37.760 --> 41:40.800
I just wish I could hold him accountable for her death.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.270
'Cause even if michelle tied that knot around her own neck, 

41:43.270 --> 41:45.450
he killed her just the same.

41:45.450 --> 41:48.810
And one count of rape won't put him away for life.

41:48.810 --> 41:54.840
But establishing a pattern of behavior could.

41:58.840 --> 41:59.620
Good night, chief.

41:59.620 --> 42:01.790
Good night, commander.
