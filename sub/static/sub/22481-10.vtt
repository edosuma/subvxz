WEBVTT

00:19.553 --> 00:22.723
Yeah! This is our prison now!
We're in charge!

00:22.756 --> 00:25.393
HONDO:
All right, finally getting

00:25.426 --> 00:26.627
some details on the riot.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.262
Three different gangs
have taken over

00:28.296 --> 00:29.597
three different sections
of the prison.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.432
They gain entry
to the control room?
Yep.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.467
That means they have keys to
nearly every cell in the place.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.802
That can't be good.
That include the armory?

00:34.835 --> 00:36.304
HONDO:
Yes, it does.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.206
Any firepower the guards have,
now they have.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.508
What gangs we looking at, boss?
TAN: One

00:40.541 --> 00:42.076
Give that man a prize.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.112
Shot caller's Katrell Porter.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.114
O.G. doing hard time.

00:46.147 --> 00:49.550
The one thing he is not
is felony stupid.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.418
In Cellblock B, it looks like

00:50.451 --> 00:52.420
the Baja Diablo cartel's
in charge now.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.323
Lot of muscle.
Bunch of veteranos

00:55.356 --> 00:57.191
running around
who like to kill people.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.127
Their leader's name
is "Moco" Hernandez.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.495
Hold up. They call
this guy Moco?

01:01.529 --> 01:02.796
LUCA: That's probably
why he's so angry.

01:02.830 --> 01:03.864
Well, the third gang's
the worst.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.766
What, Nazi Eagles?
HONDO: Yep, one and the same.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.801
They're currently in possession
of Cellblock C.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.703
Now, we all know their work:

01:09.737 --> 01:12.673
running crystal meth out
of Fontana, led by Gunnar Cade.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.343
I heard stories about him.
It's one thing to be smart
and another to be vicious,

01:15.376 --> 01:16.877
and this guy's both.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.112
Don't do this.

01:18.146 --> 01:21.415
No one here wants
to hurt you.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.219
This is a sanctuary.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.121
Sister Carmelita.

01:27.155 --> 01:31.459
Every week, you come here,
trying to redeem people.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.394
Eternal hope.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.564
Makes me wonder how I
can get a piece of that.

01:42.870 --> 01:48.276
J.R., tell your therapist
I would never violate her.

01:53.947 --> 01:58.819
Thing is, you're not
my type, Carmelita.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.389
And before you
call me racist,

02:01.422 --> 02:03.857
understand it's
not just that.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.560
I also hate Catholics.

02:06.594 --> 02:10.331
Let them go. Please.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.899
Are you begging me?

02:11.932 --> 02:14.568
If it helps them, yes.

02:14.602 --> 02:17.705
No! Gunnar!

02:17.738 --> 02:20.874
Please. Don't!

02:20.908 --> 02:25.213
Let... the civilians go.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.549
You don't want to put yourself
in any more hot water.

02:28.582 --> 02:31.352
Warden, I'm serving
three life sentences.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.487
Water can't get any hotter.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.488
All right, we
all stay sharp.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.789
The bad guys
are gonna have

02:35.823 --> 02:37.325
serious home
court advantage.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.926
There's gonna be danger
around every corner.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.428
All right, we're
here. Let's go!

02:40.461 --> 02:42.396
DEACON:
Watch each other's backs.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.741
Thank God you're here.

02:53.774 --> 02:54.975
Hondo, this is Ashe Jones.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.610
He's the owner
of this prison.

02:56.644 --> 02:57.745
Didn't know somebody
could own a prison.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.947
I'm private sector. I have
a contract with the state.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.216
They pay my company
to run this facility.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.518
What can you tell us
about what happened here?
Details are thin.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.654
Seems to have started with
the white pride prisoners.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.589
When the warden
shifted resources

03:08.622 --> 03:10.424
to try to deal with them,

03:10.458 --> 03:11.659
the Baja Diablos and
One-Niners took advantage

03:11.692 --> 03:12.693
and were able to overrun us.

03:12.726 --> 03:13.994
From what I hear,

03:14.027 --> 03:15.829
it was just too much
for our CERT Teams.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.797
Are negotiators
talking to the gangs?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.966
To the Baja Diablos
and the One-Niners, yes.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.434
They make
any demands yet?

03:20.468 --> 03:21.869
Better food, more yard
time, conjugal visits.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.437
That's pretty standard stuff.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.938
No word yet from the Nazi Eagles
and Gunnar Cade?

03:24.972 --> 03:26.440
They haven't
answered our calls.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.242
How many hostages inside?

03:28.276 --> 03:29.977
18. Prison warden, six guards,

03:30.010 --> 03:31.712
eight construction workers,

03:31.745 --> 03:34.448
two chaplains and a nun.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.850
Wait a minute.
Sister Carmelita's inside?

03:36.884 --> 03:38.852
You know her?
Yes.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.020
She goes
from prison to prison

03:40.053 --> 03:41.889
trying to rehabilitate
these guys.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.291
She asks me to speak
to them sometimes.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.692
She does good work,
hard work.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.360
Negotiators say
she may be injured.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.462
How bad?
We're trying to find out.

03:48.496 --> 03:51.965
I need your breach plan
in case talks fail.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.567
Talking to these animals
is useless.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.002
Well, I'd like to know what
Gunner Cade and his boys

03:55.035 --> 03:57.237
are up to before we go
charging in there.
What's that?

04:00.441 --> 04:03.611
JONES: Somebody turned on
a security camera in C Block.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.845
That's Gunnar Cade.

04:06.814 --> 04:10.751
That's our warden,
Phil Harvey.

04:28.536 --> 04:31.472
*

05:04.505 --> 05:06.006
HONDO: What's the ETA
on Mumford's team?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.641
JESSICA: They're stuck finishing
an operation in Century City.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.942
They'll be here
as soon as they can.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.511
Gunnar Cade's up to something.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.845
Whatever it is,
makes it more dangerous.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.381
He wouldn't kill the warden
just for kicks.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.882
He's always got an agenda.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.650
Strap up.

05:16.684 --> 05:19.520
My team's going in.
Wait. Just you?

05:19.553 --> 05:21.789
What about all these
other officers here?
They're not trained for this.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.491
If we take them in there without
knowing the lay of the land,

05:23.524 --> 05:24.758
some of them
could get grabbed.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.961
Which means more
hostages, not less.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.130
HONDO: They cut the camera
feeds, so we can't see 'em.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.865
Also means
they can't see us.
All right.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.467
We make a stealth entry.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.968
That gives us
the element of surprise.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.570
We see what the traps are,

05:36.604 --> 05:38.572
then we use these officers
here as backup.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.574
Now, if any one of us
sees Sister Carmelita,

05:40.608 --> 05:42.676
we do whatever it takes
to get her out.
Okay.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.379
Three different cellblocks,
three different gangs.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.548
We go three teams of two.
Street, Tan, you track down

05:47.581 --> 05:49.583
the Baja Diablos and
construction workers.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.985
Never thought I'd be
breaking into a prison.
JESSICA: Deacon and Chris,

05:52.019 --> 05:54.555
you got the One-Niners and
the captured prison guards.
CHRIS: You got it.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.057
Luca, you're with me.
Gunnar Cade's mine.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.870
You good?
Yup.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.406
All right, let's do this.
Go.

06:28.856 --> 06:29.857
TAN:
You two, guard the door.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.699
24-David to Command.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.868
We have breached entry
from below.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.109
20-David to Command.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.711
We're on the roof
of Cellblock C.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.645
JESSICA:
Roger that, 20-David.

06:51.679 --> 06:54.682
Three, two, one.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.120
No one exits without you
confirming their identity first.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.266
All right, Command.
On my cue.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.936
INMATE: You fools
step up, get beat down.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.838
Let's go.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.673
Now.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.144
INMATE 2:
What the hell?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.551
LUCA:
Give me your other hand!

08:03.584 --> 08:05.285
Luca, you good?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.920
Good!

08:10.558 --> 08:11.959
20-David to Command.
We're in.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.099
All three teams are inside.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.569
Any ETA on Mumford's team?

08:21.602 --> 08:23.070
We could use extra bodies.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.072
They're still on the situation
in Century City.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.174
I'll get them to you
as soon as they come available.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.942
Keep me updated.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.844
JESSICA:
Yes, sir.
Annie.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.212
Bob.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.581
What brings you by?

08:33.614 --> 08:34.715
Special occasion.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.617
You know, I tell
Deacon every day

08:36.650 --> 08:38.251
he's damn lucky you
decided to marry down.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.220
Well, don't you
let him forget it.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.556
You look busy.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.592
Never too busy for family.
You've been doing some baking.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.794
Special occasion, you said?

08:46.827 --> 08:48.095
I don't know if
anyone here remembers,

08:48.128 --> 08:49.730
but today's
the ten-year anniversary

08:49.763 --> 08:51.565
of David becoming
SWAT boot.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.233
Today's Deacon's ten-year mark
in SWAT?
Yeah.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.302
Ah. He never mentioned it.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.970
Of course he wouldn't.

08:57.004 --> 09:00.574
Oh, so it's up to his
wife to embarrass him.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.911
No, it's up to me to make sure
he gets acknowledged.
Yeah.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.345
Everything hasn't gone
his way this year.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.180
I know.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.348
I just want him to have
a little spotlight,

09:08.381 --> 09:09.783
even if it's just for a day.

09:09.817 --> 09:10.984
Admirable proposition.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.686
Unfortunately, you
just missed him.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.756
I was afraid of that.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.324
Prison riot or
high

09:17.357 --> 09:20.027
You know how this
goes, Annie.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.995
I do.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.263
You know, it was Barbara
who taught me

09:23.296 --> 09:24.998
how to be a cop's wife.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.066
Yeah?
Yeah.

09:26.099 --> 09:30.037
Oh. Well...

09:30.070 --> 09:33.774
Barb was good at that...
and just about everything else,

09:33.807 --> 09:35.676
but... I wish
I let her know that more

09:35.709 --> 09:37.344
while she was still alive,
but...

09:37.377 --> 09:40.280
Bob, I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no, no,
it's-it's all right.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.850
You know, it's been, it's been
three years since we lost Barb.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.219
I'm glad to be reminded of her.

09:46.253 --> 09:51.324
Look, if you leave this
cake in that kitchen,

09:51.358 --> 09:53.727
those ogres are gonna devour it
before Deacon ever sees it.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.763
Come on, we're gonna
keep it in my office.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.275
INMATE:
Where they at, where they at?

10:29.062 --> 10:31.732
MAN:
No! No-no, please.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.067
Oh, God.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.103
CHRIS:
Hands!

10:36.136 --> 10:37.404
Show us your hands!

10:37.437 --> 10:40.007
Put that knife down!
Show us your hands!

10:40.040 --> 10:40.941
CHRIS: Don't move!
I'm unarmed! I'm unarmed!

10:40.974 --> 10:42.109
Don't move!
I'm unarmed!

10:42.142 --> 10:43.443
Show us your hands!
I'm unarmed!

10:43.476 --> 10:45.713
I'm unarmed!
Go down!

10:48.448 --> 10:51.251
Face down! Down!

10:52.319 --> 10:54.822
He's dead.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.023
It-It's not what it looks like.
I-I'm a guard.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.224
He stole my uniform.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.292
What's your name?
Telly Appleton.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.795
Chris.

11:09.136 --> 11:12.372
He's listed in the prison
database as a guard.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.007
I-I couldn't let him take
my uniform without a fight.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.425
Do you have keys for every
room in this cellblock?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.728
Uh, only some of them.

11:34.762 --> 11:35.729
We need to know exactly where
the other prison guards

11:35.763 --> 11:36.997
are being held hostage.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.132
Okay, I, uh, I-I know
where to find them,

11:39.166 --> 11:41.134
but Katrell and these
One-Niners,

11:41.168 --> 11:42.836
they're tough, they're smart.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.271
Then we'll have to
play it smart, too.

11:44.304 --> 11:48.008
Find an indirect way in.
Any idea how to do that?

11:48.041 --> 11:50.143
I can access the service
corridors with my keys.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.112
Well, you can tell
us if you want.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.413
Look, you go back
that way five minutes,

11:53.446 --> 11:55.448
and there's officers
watching the exit.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.917
Five minutes?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.855
I-I think I'd feel safer
staying with you.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.457
Lead the way, then.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.527
Hey, I'm-I'm, I'm not

12:07.560 --> 12:08.896
a violent person,
you know.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.998
I-I don't do
things like that.

12:11.031 --> 12:11.799
How long have you
been working here?

12:11.832 --> 12:12.800
Six months.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.236
CHRIS:
What'd you do before this?

12:16.269 --> 12:18.105
TELLY:
Sacking groceries.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.940
DEACON:
No, there's training required
for a gig like this.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.142
Well, maybe in other prisons,
but not this one.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.879
I just saw a job opening
and took it.

12:25.913 --> 12:29.216
Now, I'm thinking maybe $11
an hour wasn't worth it.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.484
I mean, I-I just killed a guy.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.355
Piece of advice.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.457
When I first got this job,

12:37.490 --> 12:39.226
somebody told me that I'm
gonna see some rough things

12:39.259 --> 12:41.328
and I'm gonna have to
do some rough things.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.496
But every cop needs a chair.

12:43.530 --> 12:48.068
A... a chair?
What

12:48.101 --> 12:50.871
It's whatever you use
to decompress.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.206
For some people, it's a chair
and a glass of Scotch.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.810
For others it's a favorite
meal, a certain book.

12:56.844 --> 12:59.880
Anything.
The sooner we do this,

12:59.913 --> 13:02.115
the sooner we get you
back to your chair.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.555
Okay. Yeah.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.827
STREET: 26-David to Command.
We're deep into Cellblock B.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.362
No sign of any hostages yet.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.164
JESSICA:
Roger that, 26-David.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.399
I have the negotiation team
stalling for us.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.069
That'll only last so long
before these gangs realize
we're in here.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.203
TAN: Still got a few areas
to clear, Street.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.972
Let's keep moving.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.840
RUDI: Been wanting to see you
die for a long time!

13:26.874 --> 13:30.310
Stop here.
Today's your day,
you son of a bitch!

13:30.343 --> 13:32.846
:
That doesn't sound friendly.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.550
TAN: Inside, inside,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.986
Move. In here,
come on, come on.

13:39.019 --> 13:39.953
Room clear.
Over here.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.128
STREET:
Hurry it up.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.506
Let me see hands!
Let me see hands! Now!

13:59.539 --> 14:01.474
JACK :
...proprietary information.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.876
MAN: 'Cause you kept coming
at us, Jack, with...

14:02.910 --> 14:04.344
What the hell is this?

14:04.377 --> 14:06.179
It was you, stepping
on dialogue.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.015
JACK: I wasn't going to
roll over and let you steal...

14:08.048 --> 14:09.983
Young and the Restless.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.484
MAN: We earned every single sale
that we got, Jack...

14:11.518 --> 14:13.286
JACK: Except for the ones
you bought, right?

14:13.320 --> 14:15.088
Jack hates
his bastard brother

14:15.122 --> 14:16.656
for sleeping
with his wife.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.191
Bad blood from way back.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.659
You know there's
a riot going on?

14:19.692 --> 14:22.162
What I know is most days
they restrict TV time.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.098
Today, we got our ice cream
from the commissary...

14:25.132 --> 14:26.366
watching our stories.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.600
We're looking for
construction workers

14:27.634 --> 14:30.137
taken as hostages.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.538
Looks like you're using
some of their equipment.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.673
Don't know nothing
about no missing workers.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.109
Can tell you who's double-timing
who in Genoa City, though.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.978
All right, viewing party's over.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.347
Man, come on, chief, we're not
even hurting nobody.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.949
Why don't y'all just leave us
in here and close the door?

14:46.653 --> 14:49.056
RUDI:
You mean you're not tossing
us in there with them?

14:49.089 --> 14:50.924
STREET:
Cells are built for two.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.460
Yeah, you definitely new here.

14:55.662 --> 14:59.266
This place, everybody shares a
cell with at least four people.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.934
Why you think
there's a riot?

15:14.647 --> 15:17.717
Cut the power,
play games on the phone.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.154
Cops being cops.
We stay on mission.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.290
CARMELITA:
Hey. Hey there.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.459
Don't worry.
It's all gonna work out.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.495
Hey. Did I tell you
to talk, Sister?

15:28.528 --> 15:32.499
If I want you to open your
mouth, I will force it open.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.534
You think...
you think that scares me?

15:36.469 --> 15:40.073
Everything you say,
I've heard way worse.

15:50.483 --> 15:54.154
You've heard worse?
Well, hear this.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.267
It'll all be over soon for you.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.172
I'm gonna send you back
to that brown Jesus of yours.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.253
LUCA:
What are you thinking?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.455
First place inmates hit up when
everything starts popping off.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.223
Prison pharmacy.
To get their fix.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.164
LUCA:
Eagle tats.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.731
That's gotta be
Gunnar Cade's guy.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.233
Hostages won't be far behind.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.701
Let's move.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.256
Keep going.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.375
Okay.

17:38.325 --> 17:42.195
Okay, hostages on the far side
of the room at two o'clock,

17:42.229 --> 17:45.565
including Sister Carmelita.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.434
Gunnar Cade's in there, too.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.203
These guys are armed
to the teeth.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.538
We gotta soften 'em up.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.340
On my cue.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.282
(flashbang explodes,
inmates cry out)

18:07.387 --> 18:08.288
Go, go, go!

18:16.263 --> 18:17.697
LUCA:
Hondo!

18:19.599 --> 18:23.536
On stomachs! Hands down!
Let me see them!

18:23.570 --> 18:25.572
HICKS:
Ooh, yum.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.408
Um, y-you know what,
on second thought,

18:28.441 --> 18:30.343
that cake may not be safe
with me after all.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.813
Oh. Annie, excuse me a sec.

18:33.846 --> 18:34.914
Mm, yeah.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.583
Yeah, talk to me.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.285
JESSICA:
The good news,

18:38.318 --> 18:39.686
we've recovered two hostages--
the chaplains.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.322
The bad news,
Gunnar Cade's still loose.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.690
He has Sister Carmelita,

18:43.723 --> 18:45.592
and now he knows
we're inside the prison.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.294
We could use Mumford's team.
They're en route.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.695
They should be at your
location about ten minutes.

18:48.728 --> 18:49.929
Thanks. I'll prep 'em.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.299
Annie, I'm sorry,
I have to go.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.634
Oh, busy day.
Everything okay?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.636
Oh, we're doing the best we can.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.271
Good enough for me.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.606
And I completely understudy.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.474
Um...
I'm sorry, what?

19:01.508 --> 19:04.777
I just... uh,
it was sound advice...

19:04.811 --> 19:06.479
Yeah?

19:06.513 --> 19:09.249
:
Sounds... g-great...

19:13.486 --> 19:15.655
Are you...
a

19:15.688 --> 19:18.925
I'm f... feel my...
Annie, are you okay?

19:18.958 --> 19:22.562
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
Bob...

19:22.595 --> 19:23.963
Whoa, Annie, come on,
come on, come on, we're
gonna lie you down.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.665
We're gonna lie down, honey.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.935
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

19:28.968 --> 19:32.405
All right, now don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.874
I'm gonna get some help.
I'm gonna get some help.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.776
Somebody get me
a medic right now!

19:45.852 --> 19:47.354
Mumford's team is heading
your way.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.622
In the meantime, stay alive.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.258
Roger that.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.825
Listen, I'm not with
Gunnar's crew, man.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.661
No, what are you, an upstanding
citizen wrongly convicted?

19:54.694 --> 19:57.297
I was just trying to save
Sister Carmelita.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.698
If you guys don't find her soon,
Gunnar's gonna kill her,

19:58.731 --> 20:00.800
if she doesn't bleed out first.
Bleed out?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.001
How bad's she hurt?
Gunnar stabbed her.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.736
Said something about using her

20:03.770 --> 20:05.505
as a shield long enough
to get the job done.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.773
I'm listening. What job?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.508
I don't know.
Yeah, but you know enough

20:08.541 --> 20:10.643
to get us to help you,
not enough to help us?

20:10.677 --> 20:12.545
You guys followed me from
the pharmacy, right?

20:12.579 --> 20:14.881
I was grabbing medical supplies
for Sister Carmelita.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.284
She's the only one in this place
who ever helped me.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.687
You know, every convict's
got a story-- why should we
believe yours?

20:21.454 --> 20:22.622
What's your name?

20:22.655 --> 20:24.657
J.R. Coltrane.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.695
LUCA:
J.R. Coltrane.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.430
Charged with armed robbery
four times.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.032
That's before we get into
the white pride bullcrap.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.603
I'm not like that.
At-at least not anymore.

20:36.636 --> 20:39.339
Lift up my shirt,
you'll see.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.342
INMATE: Snitch!
INMATE 2: You ain't nothing!

20:42.375 --> 20:43.510
INMATE 1:
Tweaker!

20:43.543 --> 20:45.044
You're burning off
your old tats.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.948
I got a past, but I'm
trying to escape it.
Prove it.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.683
You say Gunnar Cade's
planning something,

20:50.717 --> 20:52.051
and he's using Sister
Carmelita as a human shield

20:52.084 --> 20:53.820
to buy time.
What's he up to?

20:53.853 --> 20:55.522
I want to help you. I do.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.324
But-but he doesn't
tell me anything.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.992
He only communicates with the
big shots, usually with kites.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.628
Prison letters, okay.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.763
He exchanges them
with his lieutenants.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.598
Other gang leaders.
All right, Luca,

21:05.632 --> 21:08.267
let's toss Gunnar Cade's
cell, see what we find.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.845
DEACON:
LAPD! Stop!

21:18.878 --> 21:20.913
Clear.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.849
LAPD SWAT!

21:22.882 --> 21:25.452
Hands! Show me
your hands!
Put 'em up!

21:25.485 --> 21:26.986
Drop 'em! Drop your weapons.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.087
Show us your hands!

21:28.120 --> 21:29.622
Drop your weapons!
Down!

21:29.656 --> 21:32.659
Get on your knees.
Down!

21:36.629 --> 21:39.699
I think you're the ones
who need to give yourselves up.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.737
Put your guns down.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.573
Y'all ain't even
got the numbers.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.775
And that's a dead end
you're stuck in.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.378
Ain't no getting past us.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.081
JESSICA: I don't have
anything new to report.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.449
You have a way
to get through to Deacon?

21:56.483 --> 21:58.017
Are you able to call him?

21:58.050 --> 21:59.419
I have a cell block up,
and he's still inside.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.387
Is there a problem?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.422
It's Annie.
I'm at the hospital with her.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.023
It's serious.
She's had a stroke or something.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.558
What happened?

22:05.592 --> 22:06.693
Doctors ran an MRI,

22:06.726 --> 22:08.628
and the stroke was caused
by bleeding in her brain.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.662
Oh, no.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.063
Look, they may need
to rush her into surgery,

22:11.097 --> 22:12.632
and they're not sure
if she's gonna make it.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.967
Now, I'm not saying she won't,

22:15.001 --> 22:16.803
but is there any way
to pull Deacon out of there?

22:16.836 --> 22:17.970
I'll find out.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.873
I said drop your guns!

22:20.907 --> 22:22.742
We ain't got nothing
to lose, homies.

22:22.775 --> 22:23.910
You can't say the same.

22:25.878 --> 22:26.979
You Katrell?

22:27.013 --> 22:29.816
That's right, redbone.
You know the name, don't you?

22:29.849 --> 22:30.950
I heard you're a smart guy
who likes to lay traps.

22:30.983 --> 22:34.086
So you should recognize
when you're being set up in one.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.489
You're not the only crew
bringing backup.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.590
Put the guns down!
CHRIS: Down!

22:37.624 --> 22:39.426
Put the guns down! Put 'em down!
Drop 'em! Drop 'em!

22:39.459 --> 22:40.693
Put 'em down!

22:40.727 --> 22:41.694
Drop 'em!
Get down on the ground.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.129
CHRIS:
Down.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.965
Drop 'em!

22:45.998 --> 22:47.934
Slide 'em towards me.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.906
How far are the other guards
from here?

22:53.940 --> 22:55.107
Uh... a few hallways down.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.877
All right, let's go.
Okay.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.746
Move.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.204
Luca.

23:25.237 --> 23:29.041
What do you see?

23:31.778 --> 23:35.014
It's one of Gunnar Cade's
prison letters.

23:35.047 --> 23:39.719
"The hills of Valhalla are
Thor's lightning paradise."

23:39.752 --> 23:40.953
Sounds like a bunch of nonsense.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.522
No, this is code.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.790
What, you really think
this has something to do

23:43.823 --> 23:44.857
with this big plan of his?

23:44.891 --> 23:46.125
If we decode it, we find out.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.060
Well, don't look at me. I'm a
shooter, not Sherlock Holmes.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.028
Well, neither am I.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.797
But I think we got somebody
who can help us.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.165
What, J.R.? I don't know, Hondo.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.734
If anybody can
break that code,

23:54.767 --> 23:56.669
it's probably him.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.506
You're really gonna
make me be the dude

23:59.539 --> 24:00.640
defending a white supremist
right now?

24:00.673 --> 24:04.544
You ever really think
you can trust a guy like that?

24:04.577 --> 24:08.214
Sister Carmelita
must've believed in him

24:08.247 --> 24:09.782
to counsel him every week.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.719
Maybe she needs us
to trust him, too.

24:15.522 --> 24:18.691
Okay.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.638
Jess? I thought there was
a cell block on the prison?

24:31.671 --> 24:32.839
I had it lifted
just for this call.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.206
What's wrong?

24:35.074 --> 24:37.243
Annie.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.711
Hicks took her to the hospital.

24:38.745 --> 24:41.748
It's serious.

24:41.781 --> 24:42.815
Does Deacon know?

24:42.849 --> 24:44.016
Not yet.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.819
Is the situation there under
control

24:46.853 --> 24:48.821
I can't say that just yet.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.256
Gunnar Cade's making
some kind of play,

24:50.289 --> 24:51.958
and we don't even know what.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.826
He's still got Sister Carmelita.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.728
We're a long way
from calling this a day.

24:55.762 --> 24:56.663
Understood.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.865
What do you want me
to do about Deacon?

25:02.134 --> 25:05.772
I'm not gonna compromise him
or the team while you're inside.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.106
We keep this between us.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.843
Roger that.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.951
Right side clear.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.520
Left side clear.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.757
What is this place?
Not sure, Rocker.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.093
Guess it used to be
the prison infirmary.

25:27.126 --> 25:30.797
Looks more like
an old factory now.

25:30.830 --> 25:34.701
Now I understand how someone
makes money running a prison.

25:34.734 --> 25:37.069
Cheap labor to make
bulletproof vests.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.304
Gun!

25:44.644 --> 25:46.212
Move, move, move!

25:48.247 --> 25:50.116
Two, two, two.

25:51.751 --> 25:52.885
Two, two, two.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.389
I see you guys are itching
for a fight.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.959
And if you think
you have nothing to lose,

26:32.992 --> 26:34.827
by all means, have at it.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.063
That said,

26:37.096 --> 26:40.099
the prison armory didn't have
enough guns for everybody.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.068
So at most,

26:42.101 --> 26:44.070
two of you are armed.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.272
The rest of you are holding
homemade shanks,

26:46.305 --> 26:50.276
assuming a bulletproof vest
will save your life.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.081
Thing about those vests,

26:55.114 --> 26:57.917
well, our 5.56 rounds

26:57.950 --> 26:59.819
go through 'em
like a knife through butter.

26:59.852 --> 27:03.355
Oh, yeah, the other
thing about those vests.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.925
They don't make 'em
for your head.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.060
And we practice our shooting

27:08.094 --> 27:10.697
all day, every day.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.733
So, you tell me.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.869
How's this gonna go?

27:19.005 --> 27:21.240
:
Easy, easy, easy.

27:27.179 --> 27:30.817
: Go.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.351
Tan, door.

27:32.384 --> 27:33.485
In the cooler,
right now!

27:33.519 --> 27:35.421
Go, let's go! Let's go!
In the cooler!
Move, move!

27:35.454 --> 27:36.422
Move, move, move!
In the cooler, let's go.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.423
Move, move!

27:37.456 --> 27:38.457
Come on, move it!

27:38.490 --> 27:40.092
Let's go!
Let's go!

27:45.131 --> 27:49.836
Moco Hernandez.
On the ground, big fella.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.138
Last warning.
On the ground now!

27:54.506 --> 27:55.975
Got your back if you
want to handle this.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.845
Thanks, Rocker.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.312
Can't we just shoot him?

28:01.881 --> 28:07.019
Fine. Okay.
We do this together.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.782
Get down, Moco.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.419
God, he's strong.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.722
I got him. Oh, God.

28:44.456 --> 28:47.059
Stay down, buddy.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.365
Excuse me. You're
here for Annie Kay?

28:53.399 --> 28:55.267
Yes. I'm-I'm not family.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.403
Uh, her husband works
for me. He's a cop.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.305
I'm trying real hard
to get him down here.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.539
Yes, well, we don't
have much time.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.740
We did more tests.

29:01.774 --> 29:04.410
The symptoms you noticed and
the bleeding in Annie's brain

29:04.443 --> 29:06.312
are the result
of a meningioma.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.880
That's a non-cancerous tumor.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.048
And how dangerous is that?

29:09.081 --> 29:11.217
There's swelling in her brain
and it's getting worse,

29:11.250 --> 29:12.484
so we have to drill
a hole into her skull

29:12.518 --> 29:13.485
and drain excess fluid.

29:13.519 --> 29:17.123
Good Lord.

29:17.156 --> 29:19.992
Just tell me the truth, Doc.
Is Barb gonna be okay?

29:20.026 --> 29:20.927
Excuse me, who's Barb?

29:20.960 --> 29:24.997
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
Um, uh, Barb was my wife.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.365
I meant to say Annie.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.267
Any time we have to
go into the brain,

29:28.300 --> 29:30.302
there's a chance there
could be serious damage.

29:30.336 --> 29:33.005
Now, we can hold off on surgery
for just a little while longer,

29:33.039 --> 29:34.473
but her husband needs
to get here soon.

29:34.506 --> 29:38.244
Yeah, well, I'm-I'm,
I'm working on that.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.283
26-David to Command.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.418
We have the construction workers
with us and Big Moco

29:46.452 --> 29:47.519
is back in custody.

29:47.553 --> 29:48.554
Roger that.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.923
That's 80% of the rioters
back in their cells.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.458
Ten hostages rescued.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.026
Seven to go.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.494
Captain, there's something else.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.695
What?

29:56.728 --> 30:00.366
Well, I heard Deacon mention
inexperienced prison guards.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.301
I've seen overcrowded cells,

30:02.334 --> 30:04.503
and I'm pretty sure
I'm standing inside a sweatshop.

30:04.536 --> 30:07.874
Just saying, maybe there's more
to this prison than we know.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.287
MAN:
Hey, Telly.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.956
Oh, nice work.

30:25.524 --> 30:28.460
It's great to see you, Tell.

30:29.061 --> 30:31.397
Thanks, Telly.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.434
Hold up. Not you.

30:35.467 --> 30:36.402
Hey, yo, Katrell.

30:36.435 --> 30:39.105
You said you was gonna
get me out of here.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.239
No chance.

30:40.272 --> 30:44.443
But you know what,
I'll do you one better.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.015
DEACON:
Hondo.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.582
We got all the One-Niners
in their cells.

30:50.616 --> 30:51.951
HONDO:
All right. Good work, Deac.

30:51.984 --> 30:54.153
Hostages are all
accounted for, too.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.187
Had a little inside help.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.322
All right, that just leaves
Sister Carmelita.

30:56.355 --> 31:01.227
DEACON: And Gunnar Cade
and his crew. We're on our way.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.295
Roger that.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.101
So it turns out,
maybe these geniuses

31:09.135 --> 31:11.938
aren't stupid after all.
Tell him what you translated.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.372
Gunnar likes World War II stuff,

31:13.405 --> 31:15.141
so he uses old codes
in his letters.

31:15.174 --> 31:16.608
Norse references stand in
for the alphabet.

31:16.642 --> 31:17.676
Sentences are actually words.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.212
This message was received
from another gang member

31:20.246 --> 31:21.948
before the riot started.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.951
What does it say?

31:24.984 --> 31:26.485
It's a single name.
Dale DeGroat.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.955
I looked it up
in prison database, got nothing.

31:30.189 --> 31:31.123
Well, then something's missing.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.125
Dale DeGroat. Let me ask.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.394
Mr. Jones, I need a word.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.063
Of course. What is it?
My team came across

31:37.096 --> 31:38.530
a name that's not
in your database.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.698
Dale DeGroat?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.300
Any idea
who that is?

31:41.333 --> 31:43.669
We keep a few inmates
in a separate cellblock:

31:43.702 --> 31:45.337
protective custody.

31:45.371 --> 31:48.207
They have to have
their own security protocol,

31:48.240 --> 31:49.608
which locks them in their
cells during a riot.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.677
Cost me a fortune.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.981
The name you're looking for,

31:55.014 --> 31:56.648
you'll find it in this file.

31:56.682 --> 32:00.052
Why didn't you show us
this before?

32:00.086 --> 32:02.388
I didn't think the riot
could reach that section.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.056
My people are finding things
inside this prison

32:04.090 --> 32:05.391
they didn't expect to find.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.059
When this is over,

32:07.093 --> 32:09.428
we're gonna come back to that.

32:11.597 --> 32:12.731
All right, listen up, people.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.700
We got an I.D. on Dale DeGroat.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.402
He's an inmate
in protective custody.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.104
LUCA: Means he's
probably an informant.
Yeah.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.306
DeGroat was transferred here
a week ago after making a deal

32:20.339 --> 32:23.309
with the D.A.'s office.
If he testifies, it could put

32:23.342 --> 32:25.677
about a dozen of Gunnar Cade's
meth business buddies in jail.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.246
So that's what
Gunnar Cade was up to.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.547
He told the other gangs
that he was gonna

32:28.580 --> 32:30.416
start a riot,
distract us long enough

32:30.449 --> 32:32.584
for him to find Dale DeGroat.
And if anything went wrong,

32:32.618 --> 32:34.620
he still had Sister Carmelita
as collateral.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.588
He's not dumb.
No, he's not.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.590
We think Gunnar Cade is
going after Dale DeGroat

32:38.624 --> 32:41.493
in Cellblock D. Let's roll.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.600
GUNNAR:
I'm your angel of death, Dale.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.736
I want you to know
what I'm gonna do with you

32:50.769 --> 32:52.971
once I burn through this door.

32:58.210 --> 33:03.215
Carmelita,
do you believe in redemption?

33:03.249 --> 33:07.319
I believe in second chances.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.522
Even for you.

33:12.291 --> 33:16.128
It's never too late to
accept God in your life.

33:16.162 --> 33:20.132
Change your ways.

33:20.566 --> 33:23.235
Don't do this.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.212
I'm gonna burn this rat alive.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.580
Then...

33:34.613 --> 33:37.449
I'll worry about redemption.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.821
Should be about five of them
left, including Gunnar Cade.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.590
Protective custody is
that way. Where's Hondo?

33:44.623 --> 33:45.757
He's coming.

33:45.791 --> 33:48.760
I'm here. Mask up.

34:10.882 --> 34:11.850
Give me a two! Two!

34:11.883 --> 34:14.453
Down! Down!

34:14.486 --> 34:16.288
Give me your hands!

34:17.456 --> 34:18.424
CHRIS:
Hands behind your back!

34:19.625 --> 34:21.393
GUNNAR:
Think I care if I get caught?

34:21.427 --> 34:22.428
No.

34:23.529 --> 34:24.830
Gun!

34:30.669 --> 34:32.171
Sister Carmelita.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.339
You all right?
Yeah.

34:33.372 --> 34:34.440
Luca!

34:34.473 --> 34:35.641
Yeah!

34:35.674 --> 34:37.209
We got you, okay? We got you.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.610
LUCA:
I got her, got her, got her.

34:38.644 --> 34:39.645
You okay?

34:39.678 --> 34:42.614
ROCKER:
Hondo, I got your six.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.812
*

35:29.561 --> 35:31.463
That's not Gunnar.
Rocker, take him.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.665
Got him.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.268
Stay down!

36:00.426 --> 36:02.928
Mr. Jones, how many guards
did you say you have?

36:02.961 --> 36:04.730
Six.
Not seven?

36:04.763 --> 36:06.832
ASHE:
No. Why?

36:06.865 --> 36:08.834
Stay back.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.446
Gunnar Cade! Get on the ground.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.814
Right now.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.952
On the ground. Now!

36:43.335 --> 36:44.503
JESSICA:
Gunnar Cade's been neutralized.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.706
Situation is under control.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.675
CARMELITA:
Thank you.
Sister.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.377
Hondo.

36:51.410 --> 36:54.246
Why am I not surprised
to see you here?

36:54.280 --> 36:56.615
I'm sorry I caused you
all this trouble.
Oh, stop it.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.817
You're never any trouble.
How is she, Luca?

36:58.850 --> 37:00.819
She's gonna be fine.
Well, better be.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.354
I got a new group
of inmates at Lompoc

37:02.388 --> 37:03.555
I'm supposed to start
with next week.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.659
HONDO:
Is that all of them?

37:07.693 --> 37:08.960
All prisoners accounted for.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.865
Deacon. I got to talk to you.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.934
All right, let me just
bandage her up first.
No, no.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.836
Let Luca do it.
I need you right now.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.405
Okay.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.509
Yeah, what is it?

37:25.043 --> 37:27.913
It's Annie.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.482
What about her?

37:33.585 --> 37:35.921
*

38:01.880 --> 38:04.416
*

38:19.665 --> 38:20.866
I'm looking for an Annie...
HICKS:
Deacon!

38:20.899 --> 38:22.067
Yeah. Where is she?

38:22.100 --> 38:23.602
I tried, I really,
I really tried, man,

38:23.635 --> 38:25.504
they just couldn't wait
any longer.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.673
She's been in surgery
the last 20 minutes.
What

38:27.706 --> 38:29.508
What
Well, we're finding out
as we go,

38:29.541 --> 38:31.743
and as soon as they know
anything, they're gonna tell us.

38:31.777 --> 38:32.944
All right?
It's gonna be okay, brother.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.813
We're gonna get through this.

38:34.846 --> 38:37.082
Thank you.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.984
Thank you for being here.
Of course, man.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.552
I don't know what I would've
done if she was alone for this.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.120
Oh, what, are you kidding me?
I can't believe that

38:42.153 --> 38:44.055
I-I wasn't here for her. I...
Oh-- hey, hey, hey, hey.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.857
Listen to me. Don't do that.

38:45.891 --> 38:48.994
Don't do that.

38:49.027 --> 38:50.662
You're gonna
drive yourself crazy.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.598
All right, believe me.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.600
I know, all right?

38:54.633 --> 38:58.069
Bottom line is, you're here now.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.508
All right?
All right?

39:02.541 --> 39:04.410
And you have people here

39:04.443 --> 39:05.811
who need you.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.978
Daddy.
Daddy.
Oh, hey.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.548
Oh.
You're here.

39:12.818 --> 39:15.353
Where is he?

39:17.589 --> 39:19.558
Tremendous job, Officer.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.993
Actually, it's Sergeant.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.629
Uh, well,
my apologies, Sergeant,

39:23.662 --> 39:25.897
uh, but this

39:25.931 --> 39:27.766
is how justice should be served.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.701
Thank you.
What are you thanking me for?

39:29.735 --> 39:30.869
Saving your sweatshop?

39:30.902 --> 39:32.438
Getting your prisoners
back under control

39:32.471 --> 39:33.872
so you can shove them
four in a cell?

39:33.905 --> 39:35.674
I don't know
what you're referring to.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.142
My ass you don't.

39:37.175 --> 39:38.677
Now, I don't know
how dirty this goes,

39:38.710 --> 39:40.412
but I know you're neck-deep.

39:40.446 --> 39:41.813
I know the warden's dead
and a nun got stabbed

39:41.847 --> 39:43.915
because of the conditions
you created in here.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.917
Be careful, Sergeant.

39:45.951 --> 39:48.620
There's still libel
laws in this country.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.088
You should be careful
what you accuse me of,

39:50.121 --> 39:52.057
unless you want to mix
it up with my lawyer.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.725
Please. Please.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.727
You tell me when and where,
and I will be there.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.162
Because I'm going
to the Bureau of Prisons,

39:57.195 --> 39:58.797
I'm gonna go
to the city council.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.632
I will bang my drum
to anyone who will listen

40:00.666 --> 40:02.968
because I will see
that you pay for all of it.

40:03.001 --> 40:06.672
I treated them like
they deserved to be treated.

40:06.705 --> 40:09.074
This is a prison,
not a country club.

40:09.107 --> 40:12.778
I'll remind you of that
when I toss your ass in one.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.951
He always angry like that?

40:19.985 --> 40:22.120
Only when he sees someone
who deserves to be behind bars.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.955
In my experience,

40:23.989 --> 40:26.925
he always puts them there.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.613
Who's that?
What's up, buddy?

40:47.646 --> 40:49.981
Hey, little man.
Hey.

40:52.718 --> 40:55.053
Hey.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.658
Hey, Deac.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.259
Yeah.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.628
You take her.

41:02.661 --> 41:03.695
Here you go.

41:03.729 --> 41:04.563
Come here, little one.

41:04.596 --> 41:05.964
Oh, go see Uncle Luca.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.933
Go sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.502
There you go.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.876
Did you get here
in time to see her?

41:17.909 --> 41:19.978
No.

41:20.011 --> 41:22.948
But you did the right thing,
though, you and Cortez.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.951
Not telling me.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.620
Would have, uh, would've
compromised my judgment

41:28.654 --> 41:29.888
and would've hurt the team.

41:32.023 --> 41:33.158
I'd have done the same thing.

41:33.191 --> 41:34.626
That's why
you're the best.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.128
And Annie's the best, too, Deac.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.498
She's gonna fight her
ass off, you know that.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.936
You know, uh...

41:44.970 --> 41:46.538
today is my...

41:46.572 --> 41:49.975
today is my tenth anniversary
with SWAT.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.109
I didn't know that.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.044
Yeah.

41:53.078 --> 41:57.649
When I started, Annie and I,
we made a will.

41:57.683 --> 42:00.652
We planned for one thing:

42:00.686 --> 42:03.855
what they would do
if something happened to me.

42:05.256 --> 42:10.829
Never planned on anything
happening to her.

42:15.166 --> 42:17.869
I did figure out
one thing, though.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.638
What's that?

42:19.671 --> 42:23.208
I know what my chair is.

42:25.110 --> 42:27.345
It's Annie.
