WEBVTT

00:09.963 --> 00:10.952
Γλυκιά μου, καλύτερα 
να πηγαίνουμε!

00:10.997 --> 00:12.828
Το αεροπλάμο της θα προσγειωθεί
σε περίπου...

00:12.866 --> 00:13.833
Ξέρω, ξέρω.

00:13.867 --> 00:15.630
Απλά θέλω να σιγουρευτώ 
πως το δωμάτιο της θα είναι βολικό.

00:15.669 --> 00:18.230
Δείχνει υπέροχο. Θα το λατρέψει.
Έλα. Πάμε.

00:18.271 --> 00:20.262
Ελπίζω ο Μπράντον να θυμάται πως 
θα μας συναντήσει στο αερδοδρόμιο.

00:20.307 --> 00:21.274
Φυσικά θα το θυμάται.

00:21.308 --> 00:23.538
- Καλύτερα να του τηλεφωνήσουμε.
- Καλύτερα να του τηλεφωνήσουμε

00:29.483 --> 00:31.815
Παρακαλώ.

00:31.852 --> 00:33.285
Καλημέρα, κα Γουόλς.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.411
- Δεν είμαι εδώ. Έχω φύγει.
- Όχι, μόλις τον χάσατε.

00:37.591 --> 00:40.389
Ναι, μου είπε για το μπάρμπεκιου.

00:40.427 --> 00:43.756
Σωστά, θα τα πούμε αργότερα.
Αντίο.

00:43.797 --> 00:46.925
Μάλλον ξεχάσαμε να βάλουμε 
ξυπνητήρι χθες βράδυ.

00:46.967 --> 00:49.697
Όχι, όχι, εσύ ξέχασες να βάλεις 
ξυπνητήρι χθες βράδυ.

00:49.736 --> 00:53.069
Ήμουν λίγο περισπασμένη.

00:53.140 --> 00:56.274
- Λατρεύω τους περισπασμούς.
- Κι εγώ.

00:59.312 --> 01:02.873
- Νιώθω λίγο περίεργα για κάτι όμως.
- Τί;

01:02.916 --> 01:04.849
Εκτος απο τους γονείς σου 
και την ’ντρεα,

01:04.885 --> 01:07.115
κανείς άλλος δεν ξέρει για μας.

01:07.154 --> 01:09.452
Αυτό επειδή σχεδόν 
όλοι όσοι ξέρουμε

01:09.489 --> 01:12.121
- λείπανε για το καλοκαίρι.
- Και τώρα επιστρέφουν.

01:12.159 --> 01:16.022
- Και;
- Για αυτό νιώθω περίεργα.

01:16.096 --> 01:19.656
Εντάξει, έχω μια ιδέα.
Γιατί δεν χωρίζουμε

01:19.699 --> 01:21.633
κι έτσι δεν θα χρειάζεται 
να το πούμε σε κανέναν.

01:21.668 --> 01:24.328
- Πολύ αστείο.
- Έτσι πίστευα.

01:25.372 --> 01:29.737
- Είδες τις κάλτσες μου;
- Τις φοράω εγώ.

01:31.711 --> 01:33.235
Γιατί φοράς τις κάλτσες μου;

01:33.280 --> 01:35.640
- Τα πόδια μου ήταν κρύα.
- Μπορώ να τις έχω πίσω, πλέον;

01:35.649 --> 01:38.814
Αν τις θες πίσω, πρέπει 
να έρθεις να τις πάρεις

01:38.885 --> 01:40.750
Θες να αργήσω, έτσι;

01:40.787 --> 01:44.416
Όχι, απλά θέλω ακόμα περισπασμό.

01:44.457 --> 01:46.152
Γιατί δεν το έλεγες;

01:47.527 --> 01:49.859
- Εντάξει.
- Σε ευχαριστώ.

01:58.772 --> 02:01.741
British Airway passenger
Jerry Fusel,

02:01.775 --> 02:05.211
please see the attendant
at gate 62B...

02:06.213 --> 02:09.339
- Γεια παιδιά. Συγνώμη που άργησα.
- Όχι, ήρθες πάνω στην ώρα.

02:09.382 --> 02:12.251
- Το αεροπλάνο της άργησε.
- Πόσο πολύ;

02:12.285 --> 02:15.513
Ας το θέσουμε έτσι. Νομίζω πως 
έχουμε ώρα να πάμε να φάμε...

02:15.755 --> 02:17.744
- στο Σαν Φρανσίκο.
- Αστειεύεσαι, έτσι;

02:17.991 --> 02:19.219
Μακάρι να αστειευόμουνα.

02:19.259 --> 02:20.692
Αυτός δεν είναι ο Ντέηβιντ;

02:20.727 --> 02:22.194
Σίλβερ! Φιλαράκο!

02:23.230 --> 02:24.197
Πως τα πας;

02:24.231 --> 02:25.721
-Good, man. How you been;
-Good, real good.

02:25.765 --> 02:27.232
What, are you working
in a coffeehouse now;

02:27.267 --> 02:28.234
Hey, that's pretty funny.

02:28.268 --> 02:29.758
When you grow up maybe
you can have one, too.

02:29.803 --> 02:30.929
-Eventually.
-What are you doing here;

02:30.971 --> 02:32.529
Well, l just dropped Mel
and Erin off.

02:32.572 --> 02:34.039
They're flying to Cleveland
to, uh, visit the grandparents.

02:34.107 --> 02:35.438
-Ah, very exciting.
-Ναι.

02:35.475 --> 02:37.909
So you and your parents waiting
for Μπρέντα to get in;

02:37.944 --> 02:39.502
No, she's staying
in London all year.

02:39.546 --> 02:41.013
-Really;
-Ναι, she did so well

02:41.047 --> 02:42.412
at the Royal Academy
this summer,

02:42.449 --> 02:44.178
they asked her to become
a full-time student.

02:44.217 --> 02:45.741
Man, that's great for her.

02:45.785 --> 02:46.809
lt's very cool for her.

02:46.853 --> 02:48.753
At this rate, we may
never see her again.

02:48.788 --> 02:51.052
So, uh, who are
you guys waiting for;

02:51.091 --> 02:52.058
The girl who's going

02:52.092 --> 02:53.719
to be staying in
Μπρέντα's room this year.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.625
The girl who's gonna be staying
in Μπρέντα's room;

02:55.662 --> 02:56.856
That's right, Σίλβερ.

02:56.896 --> 02:58.420
So who is she;

04:44.738 --> 04:46.865
Senor McKay! Senor McKay!

04:46.906 --> 04:49.932
Papa Juarez necesita verte,
necesita verte.

04:49.976 --> 04:51.375
El esta en la cantina.

04:51.411 --> 04:52.969
Parece que es importante,

04:53.012 --> 04:54.138
extremamente importante.

04:54.180 --> 04:56.239
Tell him l'll get there
when l get there.

04:59.152 --> 05:02.144
Estare cuando yo regrese.

05:34.087 --> 05:36.521
So how is this cut
working out for you;

05:36.556 --> 05:38.023
l don't know.

05:38.057 --> 05:39.024
l liked it.

05:39.058 --> 05:40.787
Ναι; Well,
maybe we'll make it

05:40.827 --> 05:42.658
just a little bit more
layered today. l was...

05:42.695 --> 05:44.322
Hi.

05:51.137 --> 05:53.605
l didn't know
she was back in town.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.971
lf l didn't know better,

05:55.008 --> 05:57.033
l might think you two weren't
quite so chummy anymore.

05:57.143 --> 05:58.576
Don't blame me.

05:58.611 --> 06:01.375
She's the one who trashed
the friendship.

06:01.414 --> 06:02.972
l'm not blaming
anyone, bubbie.

06:03.049 --> 06:04.949
All l want are the details.

06:04.984 --> 06:07.145
How dare you side with Ντέηβιντ
after what he did to me!

06:07.187 --> 06:08.484
Ντόνα, l'm not siding
with Ντέηβιντ.

06:08.521 --> 06:09.954
l'm just saying
that l can understand

06:09.989 --> 06:11.286
the kind of pressure
he was under.

06:11.324 --> 06:12.291
Oh, you would.

06:12.325 --> 06:13.314
What's that supposed
to mean;

06:13.359 --> 06:14.792
lt means that you're
just like Ariel;

06:14.828 --> 06:17.296
you'll do whatever it takes to
get the guy that you want.

06:17.330 --> 06:18.922
-Get a life!
-Ναι, l will.

06:18.965 --> 06:21.092
Just stay the hell out
of mine, okay;

06:21.134 --> 06:22.158
Things just started

06:22.202 --> 06:24.466
to get a little weird
toward the end of the year.

06:24.504 --> 06:27.962
lt's really nothing worth
getting into.

06:28.007 --> 06:30.601
You two were practically
inseparable.

06:30.643 --> 06:31.610
What happened;

06:31.644 --> 06:33.703
You didn't let a guy come
between you, did you;

06:33.746 --> 06:36.909
Look, Chad, l don't want
to start getting upset, so...

06:38.284 --> 06:40.809
...try to do something
with my hair, okay;

06:40.854 --> 06:43.015
Okay, sweetie.
l'll be back in a sec.

06:43.122 --> 06:44.180
Okay.

06:44.224 --> 06:48.524
So, what are we going to do
with these yo-yos;

07:14.988 --> 07:17.081
Tough audience.

07:17.123 --> 07:18.681
You ready
for a little unrolling;

07:18.725 --> 07:19.692
Sure.

07:19.726 --> 07:21.125
-Come on.
-Okay.

07:23.129 --> 07:24.756
l'm not talking
about anything drastic.

07:24.797 --> 07:26.389
Just thought we'd fool
around a little bit

07:26.432 --> 07:28.491
and see what we can
come up with, okay;

07:28.535 --> 07:29.593
-Okay.
-Trust me.

07:36.142 --> 07:38.610
Hi.

07:38.645 --> 07:40.977
Hello.

07:42.482 --> 07:44.541
So, when did you get back
in town;

07:44.584 --> 07:46.347
A couple days ago.

07:48.621 --> 07:51.021
My, uh, my dad's
fellowship ended,

07:51.124 --> 07:53.092
so l've been staying
here at the house.

08:02.535 --> 08:03.524
Can you forgive me;

08:06.172 --> 08:07.400
l already have.

08:09.809 --> 08:10.867
l'm so sorry.

08:10.910 --> 08:12.537
l mean, it was so
selfish of me

08:12.579 --> 08:14.706
to tell you to cut Ντέηβιντ
out of your life.

08:14.747 --> 08:15.771
Well, l probably should have,

08:15.815 --> 08:16.975
after all the pain
he caused you.

08:17.016 --> 08:18.881
Ah. So, how was your summer;

08:18.918 --> 08:19.885
Fun.

08:19.919 --> 08:21.944
How was Houston;

08:21.988 --> 08:23.387
Houston was a blast.

08:23.423 --> 08:24.685
You liked Texas;

08:24.724 --> 08:26.749
No, l loved Texas.

08:26.793 --> 08:28.556
My parents, they belong
to this country club.

08:28.595 --> 08:29.721
lt's right on the lake.

08:29.762 --> 08:32.253
And every weekend they have
barbecues and parties.

08:32.298 --> 08:33.924
And l went shopping
and swimming.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.629
And the guys at the club, they
have the most adorable accents,

08:36.669 --> 08:38.830
-Ah! -And they don't give a
hoot if l'm a virgin.

08:38.871 --> 08:41.236
So does this mean
you're over Ντέηβιντ;

08:41.274 --> 08:44.208
Oh, over and out of my life
for good. Forever.

08:44.243 --> 08:45.335
Good.

08:45.378 --> 08:46.367
So what about you;

08:46.412 --> 08:47.640
Are you back together
with Ντύλαν;

08:47.680 --> 08:49.944
Why; Do l look depressed;

08:49.983 --> 08:51.143
No.

08:52.218 --> 08:54.277
Well, l am glad we go
to the same salon.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.787
We're glad, too.

08:55.822 --> 08:56.948
Thanks, guys.

08:56.990 --> 08:58.116
Hey, no problem.

08:58.157 --> 09:00.421
Just remember that gratuities
are accepted.

09:00.460 --> 09:02.052
No amount too big.

09:02.095 --> 09:04.222
Don't listen to him.
He's so embarrassing.

09:05.331 --> 09:06.730
Oh, if you're not doing
anything later,

09:06.766 --> 09:08.165
the Γουόλςes are having
a barbecue

09:08.201 --> 09:09.964
to welcome Βάλερι
to Beverly Hills.

09:10.003 --> 09:12.096
Okay. Who is Βάλερι;

09:12.138 --> 09:14.470
Oh, she's the girl that's going
to be staying

09:14.507 --> 09:15.838
in Μπρέντα's room this year.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.672
Μπρέντα's not coming back;

09:27.220 --> 09:28.653
Coach Dennis Green...

09:28.688 --> 09:31.657
Well, l finally got a straight
story from the supervisor.

09:31.691 --> 09:34.319
Apparently, one of the
executive vice presidents

09:34.360 --> 09:37.227
of the airlines got a major
case of food poisoning up there

09:37.263 --> 09:40.164
and they had to make an
emergency landing in Denver.

09:40.199 --> 09:41.393
Ooh...

09:41.434 --> 09:42.901
Well, apparently, her flight
should be arriving

09:42.935 --> 09:43.902
within the hour, though.

09:43.936 --> 09:45.426
-Thanks, honey.
-That was some hit.

09:45.471 --> 09:47.564
ls it my imagination
or is the NFL camera work

09:47.607 --> 09:49.632
-a whole lot better this season;
-lt seems to be better.

09:49.676 --> 09:53.134
ls it my imagination or are you
two deliberately ignoring me;

09:53.179 --> 09:54.669
We heard everything
you said, honey.

09:54.714 --> 09:56.341
What'd she say;

09:56.382 --> 09:57.906
l have no idea, Dad.

09:57.950 --> 10:00.976
Ha-ha. l just hope poor Βάλερι
is handling this

10:01.020 --> 10:01.987
flight all right.

10:02.021 --> 10:03.010
l just hope l recognize Βάλερι.

10:03.122 --> 10:05.750
Last time l saw her
she was 14, a little chubby

10:05.792 --> 10:07.851
and had a mouth full
of hardware.

10:07.894 --> 10:10.328
Well, we saw Βάλερι the last
time we were in Buffalo

10:10.363 --> 10:12.160
and she was definitely
past the braces stage.

10:12.198 --> 10:14.962
And she's very excited about
coming here and going to C.U.

10:15.001 --> 10:17.162
and getting to start over
in a whole new place.

10:17.203 --> 10:18.170
l'm sure she is.

10:18.204 --> 10:20.035
So there's no need for anyone
to know what

10:20.073 --> 10:21.540
she's been through
these last few months.

10:21.574 --> 10:23.235
Mom, l am not brain dead,
all right;

10:23.276 --> 10:24.709
Will you give me
a little credit;

10:24.744 --> 10:26.678
Diving over right tackle!
Touchdown!

10:26.713 --> 10:29.011
Well, Dad, it seems the Vikings
have this game wrapped up.

10:29.048 --> 10:30.743
-l'm out of here.
-Where are you going;

10:30.783 --> 10:33.013
Well, this may qualify as a case
of real bizarre timing,

10:33.052 --> 10:36.249
but l think Στιβ's plane
is coming in from Hawaii...

10:36.289 --> 10:38.257
right about now.

10:38.291 --> 10:39.656
Hey!

10:39.692 --> 10:42.217
Thanks, Howie. l've been
a big fan of yours

10:42.261 --> 10:44.058
-ever since the Raiders
moved to L.A. -Howie!

10:44.163 --> 10:46.256
lt's not gonna be the same
without you.

10:46.299 --> 10:48.290
Well, thanks a lot, buddy.
That's nice of you to say.

10:48.334 --> 10:49.528
Howie, is this your bag;

10:49.569 --> 10:51.503
That's one of them.
Thanks, buddy.

10:51.537 --> 10:53.061
ls that Troy Aikman;

10:53.172 --> 10:54.537
Uh...

10:54.574 --> 10:56.064
does he look like Troy Aikman;

10:56.142 --> 10:59.077
Mr. Aikman, Troy,
could you sign my book;

10:59.145 --> 11:00.578
Ναι, sure kid.

11:00.613 --> 11:02.308
-What's your name;
-Στιβ.

11:02.348 --> 11:03.406
What...

11:03.449 --> 11:04.643
My name is Στιβ.

11:04.684 --> 11:06.618
Your name's Στιβ, right.

11:06.652 --> 11:07.880
Yo, Στιβ.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.012
-Ναι;
-Ναι;

11:09.122 --> 11:11.454
Look at you-- one summer
in Hawaii,

11:11.491 --> 11:12.458
you're a celebrity, Sanders.

11:12.492 --> 11:13.891
-Μπράντον.
-Sanders;

11:13.926 --> 11:15.120
l thought you were Aikman.

11:15.161 --> 11:16.958
Only to his closest
friends, man.

11:16.996 --> 11:18.122
Delta Airlines passenger

11:18.164 --> 11:20.029
Ken Bird, pick up
a white courtesy telephone...

11:20.066 --> 11:21.397
Don't worry,
he'll get over it.

11:21.434 --> 11:23.231
Μπράντον, l want you
to meet someone.

11:23.269 --> 11:25.032
Howie Long, this is Μπράντον
Γουόλς, my best friend.

11:25.104 --> 11:26.696
Hey, how you doing, buddy;

11:26.739 --> 11:28.263
How you doing, Howie;
Nice to meet you.

11:28.307 --> 11:29.535
Well, look, l'm gonna take off.

11:29.575 --> 11:30.633
Remember, not a word

11:30.676 --> 11:31.938
to your mom, all right;

11:31.978 --> 11:33.809
-Take care. -Your secret's safe
with me, man.

11:33.846 --> 11:35.507
All right.
Take care.

11:35.548 --> 11:37.448
How'd you get to be so
tight with Howie Long;

11:37.483 --> 11:39.280
Well, in classic
Sanders fashion,

11:39.318 --> 11:41.843
l finagled myself an upgrade
into first class,

11:41.888 --> 11:43.879
and there he was,
sitting by the window.

11:43.923 --> 11:45.618
Turns out when he
was a kid he had

11:45.658 --> 11:48.354
some fairly substantial
fantasies about my mom.

11:48.394 --> 11:50.692
What a way to bond.
So how was Hawaii, man;

11:50.730 --> 11:52.595
-Oh... -How's Celeste;
Wait, let me guess.

11:52.632 --> 11:54.759
You played golf every
day, you ate ahi tuna,

11:54.801 --> 11:56.666
at night you sucked back
a couple passion fruits,

11:56.702 --> 11:58.067
had a little action
on the beach.

11:58.171 --> 12:00.071
Well, that was July.

12:00.139 --> 12:01.436
And what about August;

12:01.474 --> 12:04.500
ln August, she gave me
the big aloha.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.006
Man...

12:07.046 --> 12:08.240
Ναι.

12:08.281 --> 12:10.681
We were snorkeling in Kapalua
Bay one day, and we literally

12:10.716 --> 12:12.547
swam into some guy she knew
from high school.

12:12.585 --> 12:14.985
lt turns out he was a great
lost love of her life.

12:15.021 --> 12:16.784
l'm sorry-- l know you kinda

12:16.823 --> 12:19.018
had your sights set on
her for the long haul.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.353
Maybe it was for the best.

12:20.393 --> 12:22.361
ln fact, l don't think the
timing could've been better.

12:22.395 --> 12:23.987
Be right back.

12:24.030 --> 12:25.156
Really;

12:25.198 --> 12:26.529
Ναι.

12:26.566 --> 12:28.329
You know, after she bailed,

12:28.367 --> 12:30.460
l'd go out to the driving range,

12:30.503 --> 12:32.266
knock out a couple buckets,

12:32.305 --> 12:34.637
and there l'd be,
overlooking the ocean,

12:34.674 --> 12:36.198
trade winds blowing
in my face,

12:36.242 --> 12:38.233
everything smelling
all fresh and tropical,

12:38.277 --> 12:39.767
and all l could think about

12:39.812 --> 12:41.905
were all the failed
relationships l'd been in.

12:41.948 --> 12:43.916
Uh, Στιβ, don't get down
on yourself, man.

12:43.950 --> 12:45.349
You'll find the right
girl someday.

12:45.384 --> 12:46.817
l know-- l already have.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.378
You have;

12:49.422 --> 12:52.050
Ναι, there's only one
girl who matters to me.

12:52.091 --> 12:53.718
We both know who she is.

12:53.759 --> 12:55.056
We do;

12:55.094 --> 12:56.391
Κέλυ.

12:56.429 --> 12:57.521
Κέλυ Taylor;

12:57.563 --> 12:59.531
Κέλυ is the great
love of my life.

12:59.565 --> 13:01.556
l'm gonna do everything
in my power

13:01.601 --> 13:04.365
to win her over, and
you've gotta help me.

13:19.018 --> 13:20.747
Thank you.

13:20.786 --> 13:23.254
Nurse Alexander to Admitting.
Nurse Alexander...

13:23.289 --> 13:24.449
Looking for the scrub soap;

13:24.490 --> 13:25.787
Where'd you find it;

13:25.825 --> 13:27.793
Well, there's always a supply
by the doctors' sink

13:27.827 --> 13:30.125
in the next room--
it's easy, you know, to open.

13:30.162 --> 13:32.392
You just have to peel it...
and punch it.

13:32.431 --> 13:35.332
-Done. -Boy, you sure seem to
have this routine down pat.

13:35.368 --> 13:38.132
Force of habit.
l've been on this ward now

13:38.170 --> 13:40.730
every day for the last
three months, but today,

13:40.773 --> 13:43.503
l'm taking home the most
beautiful baby in the world.

13:43.542 --> 13:45.237
Oh, congratulations.

13:45.278 --> 13:46.506
Thank you.

13:46.545 --> 13:49.378
Her name's Hannah,
and my husband should be

13:49.415 --> 13:51.781
giving her the last feeding
as we speak.

13:51.817 --> 13:53.216
That must be so exciting.

13:53.252 --> 13:55.277
Actually, we're trying to
keep it very low-key.

13:55.321 --> 13:56.811
Why;

13:56.856 --> 13:59.882
Oh, look, l'm sorry,
l don't mean to pry.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.518
No, it's okay.

14:01.560 --> 14:05.929
Actually it's your, uh,
basic war story.

14:05.965 --> 14:08.559
Do you, uh... do you
have a baby here;

14:08.601 --> 14:10.762
Ναι, a little boy.

14:10.803 --> 14:13.101
We had to have him medevaced in
from Riverside.

14:13.139 --> 14:14.436
He's a preemie.

14:14.473 --> 14:16.998
Well, you should definitely
hear our story.

14:17.109 --> 14:18.872
lt just happened
a month ago.

14:18.911 --> 14:21.243
They called it graduation day
because it was the day they

14:21.280 --> 14:23.373
told us Hannah was finally big
enough to take home.

14:23.416 --> 14:25.407
My family,
my husband's family, friends,

14:25.451 --> 14:28.011
they were all at our apartment
waiting to welcome her.

14:28.054 --> 14:30.284
lt was going to be
a really great day.

14:30.323 --> 14:33.986
The only problem was,
l refused to take her home.

14:34.026 --> 14:36.586
l kept telling them
something was wrong,

14:36.629 --> 14:38.824
but the doctors and the nurses
kept assuring me

14:38.864 --> 14:40.832
that she was fine,
and l was just nervous

14:40.866 --> 14:42.493
about having to take care
of her by myself.

14:42.535 --> 14:45.436
They said it was a common thing
with mothers of preemies,

14:45.471 --> 14:48.031
but as the hours went by,
l started to feel the pressure,

14:48.107 --> 14:49.597
and by that point,
even my husband

14:49.642 --> 14:50.666
thought l was being ridiculous.

14:50.710 --> 14:53.372
’ντρεα, it's getting late.

14:53.412 --> 14:55.312
l'm gonna have to ask
you to reconsider.

14:55.348 --> 14:57.213
So l gave in.

14:57.249 --> 14:58.511
Fine...

14:58.551 --> 15:01.543
l told them, fine, one more
feeding and we'd take her home.

15:01.587 --> 15:04.215
That's being sensible.

15:04.256 --> 15:06.986
That's when Τζέσι commented
how peaceful Hannah seemed

15:07.093 --> 15:09.960
in my arms, and we all looked
and she was turning blue.

15:09.996 --> 15:10.985
Oh, my God!

15:11.030 --> 15:13.624
We've got a code blue!

15:13.666 --> 15:15.566
What are you doing
with my baby;!

15:15.601 --> 15:16.590
Wait.

15:22.141 --> 15:23.768
Come on, let's move it.

15:23.809 --> 15:26.334
lt was the worst 42 seconds
of my life,

15:26.379 --> 15:28.176
but they finally
got her breathing.

15:28.214 --> 15:30.182
And now she's fully recovered.

15:30.216 --> 15:31.478
What was it;

15:31.517 --> 15:34.350
Well, there was a small tear
in her abdominal wall,

15:34.387 --> 15:35.877
and it caused a strangulation.

15:35.921 --> 15:37.513
The doctors didn't see it
because they weren't

15:37.556 --> 15:38.648
looking for it.

15:38.691 --> 15:41.353
l mean, after all,
it was graduation day.

15:41.394 --> 15:44.488
But if you had listened to them
and taken her home earlier...

15:44.530 --> 15:46.521
She'd be dead.

15:46.565 --> 15:50.228
The one thing l learned
is never be afraid

15:50.269 --> 15:52.703
to follow your instincts--
let them laugh at you,

15:52.738 --> 15:54.205
let them call you
an hystΈρικαl mother.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.969
lt's doesn't matter,
it's your baby.

15:56.008 --> 15:57.475
l mean, you've
gotta protect him.

15:57.510 --> 15:59.171
l mean, who else is going to;

16:01.614 --> 16:02.911
Ah.

16:02.948 --> 16:04.779
Here she is.

16:06.152 --> 16:07.744
Here's Mommy.

16:07.787 --> 16:10.221
There's my little girl.

16:10.256 --> 16:12.588
She's ready to go home.

16:12.625 --> 16:15.992
Oh, she's gorgeous.

16:16.095 --> 16:17.995
Thank you.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.326
Good luck.

16:19.365 --> 16:21.856
Thank you.

16:25.071 --> 16:29.167
-Ready...;
-Oh, okay, bye.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.676
How long is this gonna take;

16:31.710 --> 16:33.974
Κέλυ, you can't rush
technology.

16:34.013 --> 16:36.447
Wake me when you're done.

16:36.482 --> 16:38.712
Okay, here we go--
this is it.

16:44.290 --> 16:46.485
With its motto being
''lt's smart to be smart,''

16:46.525 --> 16:49.756
C.U. has taught tens of
thousands of students

16:49.795 --> 16:53.026
over the years, and one of them
happens to be me.

16:53.132 --> 16:55.896
Hi, l'm Ντέηβιντ Σίλβερ.

16:55.935 --> 16:57.869
Hey! Psst! Over here...

16:57.903 --> 17:01.031
Over, right... there.
Great, that's much better.

17:01.073 --> 17:04.166
Now since the final assignment
in Professor

17:04.210 --> 17:08.704
Langberg's TV Production 201
was to do a short video project,

17:08.747 --> 17:11.944
l have constructed this highly
technical diagram,

17:11.983 --> 17:14.544
just to show you what happened
during my summer vacation.

17:14.587 --> 17:16.987
Now here is...

17:17.089 --> 17:17.987
Down...

17:18.089 --> 17:19.387
Here is when Babyface asked me

17:19.425 --> 17:22.394
to go on tour with him and his
band to Japan.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.998
And here...

17:28.032 --> 17:31.196
and here is when Ariel
threw a party for me

17:31.237 --> 17:34.638
with some of my closest friends
to celebrate my big break.

17:37.343 --> 17:40.972
lmmediately followed
by the long weekend

17:41.013 --> 17:43.413
me and Ariel spent
on her waterbed.

17:44.917 --> 17:47.147
This is hilarious.

17:47.186 --> 17:49.211
Wait, shh, here's the part
where it gets tragic.

17:49.255 --> 17:53.954
But unfortunately, what goes up
must come down.

17:53.993 --> 17:57.121
So, here is when Babyface
changed his mind

17:57.163 --> 17:58.562
and went on tour without me...

17:58.597 --> 18:02.624
and the next day when Ariel
broke up with me...

18:02.668 --> 18:05.694
And here's the day when the
doctor put me on medication

18:05.738 --> 18:10.835
to treat me for the unexpected
party favor that Ariel gave me.

18:13.045 --> 18:14.205
Crabs;

18:14.246 --> 18:17.613
But don't worry, thanks to the
magic of Pyrinate A-200,

18:17.650 --> 18:19.709
everything turned out okay.

18:19.752 --> 18:24.246
Now, here is where l got
my own dorm room.

18:24.290 --> 18:28.818
Here is where my grandfather
bought me a new car.

18:28.861 --> 18:30.726
And here is the day

18:30.763 --> 18:33.823
when Professor Langberg watched
my video confession.

18:33.866 --> 18:37.393
This is outstanding.

18:37.436 --> 18:41.099
How can l possibly not give this
young man an A+;

18:42.808 --> 18:44.366
Thank you, Professor.

18:44.410 --> 18:46.810
That means l won't be on
academic probation anymore.

18:46.845 --> 18:49.439
That means l can
have a life again.

18:49.481 --> 18:52.348
Hot damn! lt is
smart to be smart!

18:57.022 --> 18:58.614
Bravo.

18:58.657 --> 19:02.058
Well, l certainly hope Langberg
gave you an A for that.

19:02.094 --> 19:04.460
Actually an A-, but he wants me
to get involved

19:04.496 --> 19:06.794
in the campus TV station
this fall.

19:06.832 --> 19:08.322
lt's gonna be
a little different,

19:08.367 --> 19:09.959
but l'm actually
looking forward to it.

19:10.002 --> 19:11.469
-That's great.
-Thanks.

19:11.503 --> 19:14.165
Well, l'm gonna take the rest of
these boxes up to the dorm

19:14.206 --> 19:17.664
so it'll look like
l never lived here.

19:17.710 --> 19:20.440
Are you gonna go
to the barbecue;

19:20.479 --> 19:22.811
Uh... doubtful.

19:22.848 --> 19:25.976
You're gonna have to run into
her sooner or later.

19:26.085 --> 19:27.382
Ναι, well, l'd prefer later.

19:27.419 --> 19:28.852
Look, l don't want to ruin

19:28.887 --> 19:30.980
the Γουόλςes' barbecue
or Ντόνα's evening.

19:31.090 --> 19:33.456
Well, for your information,
Ντόνα is doing just fine

19:33.492 --> 19:35.483
without you in her life,
thank you very much.

19:35.527 --> 19:36.960
Well, actually,
l have other plans.

19:36.996 --> 19:38.759
Hmm! Excuses, excuses.

19:38.797 --> 19:41.425
Don't go anywhere,
l'm not done with you yet.

19:41.467 --> 19:42.957
Hello.

19:43.002 --> 19:44.799
Hi, l was hoping it was you.

19:44.837 --> 19:45.963
-How's Βάλερι;
-She's great.

19:46.005 --> 19:47.802
She's much more together than l
thought she'd be.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.398
l can't wait for you
to meet her.

19:49.441 --> 19:50.601
Well, when do you want me to
come over;

19:50.643 --> 19:52.804
Actually, l thought l'd come by
and pick you up.

19:52.845 --> 19:54.107
Oh, you don't have to.

19:54.146 --> 19:55.477
Well, l think l want to.

19:55.514 --> 19:56.981
ln that case...

19:57.016 --> 19:58.278
Have fun at the barbecue.

19:58.317 --> 19:59.477
You are a coward, Ντέηβιντ.

19:59.518 --> 20:01.486
l know, l know.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.147
You didn't say anything

20:03.188 --> 20:04.678
to Σίλβερ about us, did you;

20:04.723 --> 20:08.887
No. Not to Ντέηβιντ and not to
Ντόνα, and that was hard.

20:08.927 --> 20:10.360
Well, l think the guy that
it's gonna be

20:10.396 --> 20:12.364
really hard to break it to
is Στιβ.

20:12.398 --> 20:14.229
He's come back from Hawaii
totally convinced

20:14.266 --> 20:16.200
that you are the true love
of his life.

20:16.235 --> 20:18.203
Please.

20:18.237 --> 20:21.604
Every time Στιβ gets dumped he
gets sentimental about me.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.834
Hmm, l don't know.

20:22.875 --> 20:25.036
l know how to handle Στιβ.

20:25.110 --> 20:27.044
lt's Ντύλαν l'm worried about.

20:27.079 --> 20:28.512
Ναι. Me, too.

20:37.756 --> 20:41.157
Senor Ντύλαν, it's good
to see you, my friend.

20:41.193 --> 20:42.990
Quieres cerveza;

20:43.028 --> 20:44.518
Sure.

20:50.169 --> 20:51.727
Sorry l'm late.

20:51.770 --> 20:54.295
Must've just, uh, lost
track of time, you know.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.672
Along with how much
money you owe me.

20:56.709 --> 20:58.973
C'mon Juarez.
l've run up a tab before.

20:59.011 --> 21:01.741
Yes, but that's when your
credit cards were good.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.270
Now they bounce
from here to Oaxaca.

21:03.315 --> 21:06.182
You know, if you're gonna talk
about my credit cards that way,

21:06.218 --> 21:08.015
l think we probably
ought to be alone.

21:08.087 --> 21:09.179
l don't think you're

21:09.221 --> 21:11.519
in a position
to make demands, my friend.

21:11.557 --> 21:17.655
Look, you have had a fine time
down here the last two months

21:17.696 --> 21:22.395
with my ladies, my booze, but
now it's time to settle up.

21:25.437 --> 21:27.837
What happened to you, hombre;

21:27.873 --> 21:30.740
You used to be worth millions.

21:30.776 --> 21:32.175
l got ripped off.

21:32.211 --> 21:33.269
By who;

21:35.447 --> 21:37.574
They said they were my family.

21:37.616 --> 21:39.379
-Did you go to the police;
-Ναι.

21:39.418 --> 21:43.514
Police showed me pictures of my
family in a mug book.

21:43.555 --> 21:46.956
No wonder you started drinking
again, huh;

21:50.095 --> 21:52.325
Go back to L.A.

21:52.364 --> 21:55.891
Get your house in order.
We'll do business again.

21:55.934 --> 21:58.459
Gracias.

21:58.504 --> 22:02.372
But before you can go,
you must leave something

22:02.408 --> 22:04.808
with me as a show of good faith.

22:04.843 --> 22:07.334
Like your watch.

22:07.379 --> 22:08.676
That's my father's watch.

22:08.714 --> 22:12.013
Well, l could take your car.

22:19.558 --> 22:22.220
You can have it back
when you pay up.

22:44.249 --> 22:45.216
Aloha!

22:45.250 --> 22:46.239
Στιβ.

22:46.285 --> 22:48.048
Yes, it is, and fresh
from the Puna Valley

22:48.153 --> 22:50.587
l brought you these
lovely hula orchids,

22:50.622 --> 22:54.251
along with a very
special island welcome.

22:54.293 --> 22:56.227
You shouldn't have.

22:56.261 --> 22:58.286
Of course l should have.

23:01.333 --> 23:04.166
Hey! Taylor, l'm here!

23:04.203 --> 23:06.398
Here we are.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.770
Στιβ.

23:08.807 --> 23:10.968
What's going on, Μπράν;

23:12.711 --> 23:15.009
Well, Μπράντον just came

23:15.047 --> 23:17.015
to give me a ride
to the barbecue.

23:17.049 --> 23:19.540
That's right.
We're having a barbecue.

23:22.054 --> 23:23.316
So how you doing, man;

23:23.355 --> 23:25.550
Well, it'd be going a heck
of a lot better

23:25.591 --> 23:27.422
if you'd let me take
Κέλυ to the barbecue.

23:27.459 --> 23:29.689
lf you know what l'm saying.

23:29.728 --> 23:30.956
Well, um...

23:33.065 --> 23:34.430
l think we should tell him.

23:35.834 --> 23:37.096
Tell him what;

23:40.205 --> 23:41.502
No.

23:43.175 --> 23:44.733
No...

23:44.776 --> 23:48.371
lt just sort of happened
this summer, you know;

23:48.413 --> 23:49.846
Took on a life of its own.

23:50.916 --> 23:52.042
What about you and me;

23:52.084 --> 23:54.814
Well, we'll always
have high school.

23:54.853 --> 23:56.912
Oh...

23:56.955 --> 23:59.048
Oh, don't be mad.

23:59.157 --> 24:01.057
Look, l'm not mad, l just...

24:01.093 --> 24:02.458
When am l ever

24:02.494 --> 24:04.257
gonna find the great
love of my life;

24:04.296 --> 24:05.263
l promise,

24:05.297 --> 24:07.993
l will introduce you
to every new pledge

24:08.033 --> 24:09.364
at the Alpha House, okay;

24:09.401 --> 24:13.201
And l will be scouring
the countryside

24:13.238 --> 24:15.001
for you, my man.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.667
Haven't you done
enough for one day;

24:16.708 --> 24:17.732
No, because

24:17.776 --> 24:19.368
l haven't introduced
you to Βάλερι yet,

24:19.411 --> 24:21.003
who l happen to think
is pretty cool.

24:21.046 --> 24:23.344
Bra, how cool can she be;

24:23.382 --> 24:24.349
She's from Buffalo.

24:24.383 --> 24:26.351
And what's wrong with Buffalo;

24:26.385 --> 24:28.012
Buffalo lost three
Super Bowls in a row.

24:28.053 --> 24:29.020
Στιβ, they've lost

24:29.054 --> 24:30.385
four Super Bowls in a row,

24:30.422 --> 24:32.287
but what does that have
to do with Βάλερι;

24:36.428 --> 24:38.362
All right.

24:38.397 --> 24:40.024
Okay.

24:40.065 --> 24:41.089
l'll go to the barbecue.

24:42.935 --> 24:45.062
l wonder how good
grilled orchids taste.

24:47.406 --> 24:50.034
l hear they're not bad
with a little coconut sauce.

24:50.075 --> 24:51.042
He'll get over it.

24:51.076 --> 24:52.065
Ναι.

24:56.281 --> 24:57.748
Ooh.

25:02.421 --> 25:03.752
Mmm. Something smells good.

25:03.789 --> 25:04.847
Well, you know my father.

25:04.890 --> 25:06.721
He never met a lava
rock he didn't like.

25:06.758 --> 25:08.783
Guys, stop trying to
be so festive, okay;

25:08.827 --> 25:09.794
Hi, everybody.

25:09.828 --> 25:10.817
Hey, look who's here.

25:10.862 --> 25:12.295
Now we can finally eat.

25:12.331 --> 25:15.664
Uh... But first we have a few
introductions to make.

25:15.701 --> 25:17.328
-Μπράντον;
-Ah, right.

25:17.369 --> 25:18.529
Βάλερι;

25:18.570 --> 25:20.265
-Hey, Μπράντον.
-Hi. How you doing;

25:20.305 --> 25:21.670
-Good. How are you;
-Good.

25:21.707 --> 25:23.197
l'd like you to meet some
friends of mine.

25:23.241 --> 25:24.936
-This is Κέλυ Taylor.
-Hi.

25:24.977 --> 25:26.911
Hi. Welcome to L.A.

25:26.945 --> 25:29.004
Thanks. l'm really
happy to be here.

25:29.047 --> 25:30.776
This is exactly
where l want to be.

25:30.816 --> 25:32.875
And this guy over here is

25:32.918 --> 25:34.010
my best friend.

25:34.052 --> 25:35.349
He just got back from Hawaii.

25:35.387 --> 25:37.218
Doesn't usually have
that good of a tan...

25:37.255 --> 25:39.553
Oh, well, hello, best
friend. l'm Βάλερι.

25:39.591 --> 25:40.649
Στιβ Sanders.

25:40.692 --> 25:41.886
You know, l think you're just

25:41.927 --> 25:43.394
the guy l'm
looking for, Στιβ Sanders.

25:43.428 --> 25:44.452
Oh;

25:44.496 --> 25:46.225
Ναι. See what you can do

25:46.264 --> 25:47.697
with this jar
of pickles, will you;

25:47.733 --> 25:48.825
lt's stuck.

25:48.867 --> 25:51.233
Sure. Relish is my
specialty, but...

25:51.269 --> 25:52.600
l'll give it a try.

25:54.406 --> 25:55.464
Ooh. A toughie.

25:55.507 --> 25:57.236
My hero.

25:57.275 --> 25:58.299
Thank you.

25:58.343 --> 25:59.640
Anytime.

26:09.354 --> 26:11.982
You know, bud, l don't
think l gave Buffalo

26:12.024 --> 26:15.016
all the credit
that it deserves.

26:18.630 --> 26:20.894
Okay, guys, the ball's coming
in. You ready; Ball's coming in.

26:20.932 --> 26:22.797
Hey, watch it, you
pencil-pusher.

26:22.834 --> 26:24.859
Hey, hey, hey,
Mr. Hollywood.

26:24.903 --> 26:27.201
Put it up, Βάλερι, put
it up! Come on, Βάλ.

26:27.239 --> 26:29.207
Ohh... double dribble!

26:29.241 --> 26:30.708
Oh, no!

26:30.742 --> 26:31.709
Yes!

26:31.743 --> 26:32.971
What can l say;

26:33.011 --> 26:34.672
She makes me look good.

26:34.713 --> 26:35.680
And that ain't easy.

26:35.714 --> 26:36.908
Need an oxygen break, Dad;

26:36.948 --> 26:38.006
No, no, no, just take it out.

26:38.083 --> 26:39.311
Come on, come on.

26:39.351 --> 26:40.818
Oh, come on, just... Oh!

26:40.852 --> 26:42.683
Whoa.
Yes!

26:42.721 --> 26:45.019
Βάλερι's parents
were our best friends

26:45.057 --> 26:46.024
back in Minnesota.

26:46.058 --> 26:47.889
Ναι, she was telling us.

26:47.926 --> 26:49.154
Before they moved to New York,

26:49.194 --> 26:50.684
we used to spend every
family vacation together.

26:50.729 --> 26:52.253
Well, don't worry, we'll
make her feel right at home.

26:52.297 --> 26:53.889
-Thanks.
-Yes!

26:53.932 --> 26:55.866
What are we gonna do
with all this food;

26:55.901 --> 26:57.232
l know ’ντρεα

26:57.269 --> 26:59.032
and Τζέσι can't make it,
but what about Ντέηβιντ;

26:59.104 --> 27:01.538
What about Ντέηβιντ;

27:01.573 --> 27:05.339
l know for a fact
that he's not coming.

27:05.377 --> 27:06.844
Oh. Well...

27:06.878 --> 27:07.867
That's okay.

27:09.581 --> 27:12.709
Well, l hope he didn't
stay away on my account.

27:16.154 --> 27:18.987
Either of you ready
to come in off the bench;

27:19.057 --> 27:20.991
lsn't there some rule about
waiting a half-hour

27:21.093 --> 27:22.287
after you eat before you play;

27:22.327 --> 27:25.455
Uh, unfortunately l... l
brought the wrong shoes.

27:25.497 --> 27:26.987
Hey, Βάλερι. Come on.

27:27.032 --> 27:29.330
We don't want them to get
back in the game yet.

27:29.367 --> 27:31.528
Next time, l gotta
remember that shoe trick.

27:31.570 --> 27:32.798
Come on.

27:32.838 --> 27:33.827
All right, it's our ball.

27:33.872 --> 27:35.669
You know, she's really nice.

27:35.707 --> 27:37.641
l can't believe how well
she's handling everything.

27:37.676 --> 27:38.802
What do you mean;

27:38.844 --> 27:41.677
Oh, l probably shouldn't
say anything,

27:41.713 --> 27:43.544
but after the Γουόλςes
and l got back

27:43.582 --> 27:44.640
from Lake Minnetonka...

27:44.683 --> 27:46.344
Whoa, wait a minute.

27:46.384 --> 27:49.717
You were in Minnesota
with the Γουόλςes;

27:49.755 --> 27:51.484
Are you and Μπράντον...;

27:51.523 --> 27:52.785
Yes.

27:52.824 --> 27:55.190
-l knew it.
-Don't make a big deal.

27:55.227 --> 27:57.218
Okay; Στιβ's having
a little trouble

27:57.262 --> 27:58.786
adjusting to the concept.

27:58.830 --> 28:01.492
Well, it looks like
Στιβ's moved on.

28:01.533 --> 28:02.966
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

28:03.001 --> 28:04.468
Oh, yes!

28:04.503 --> 28:05.868
Another one.
Ohh...

28:05.904 --> 28:07.531
So, tell me, what
happened with Βάλερι;

28:07.572 --> 28:10.268
Well, we'd all just sat down
for dinner and the phone rang.

28:10.308 --> 28:12.299
Oh, Dad.

28:12.344 --> 28:14.972
Why is it every time l start
to carve, the phone rings;

28:15.013 --> 28:16.071
Honey, l'll get it.

28:16.114 --> 28:17.706
No, no, no. l'm
sure it's for me.

28:17.749 --> 28:19.216
Joe Kawabe's going
through a major audit

28:19.251 --> 28:21.651
and the whole world has
to stop because of it.

28:21.686 --> 28:24.177
He knows we just got home
from our vacation yesterday,

28:24.222 --> 28:25.450
but of course he can't wait

28:25.490 --> 28:26.889
till Τζιμ gets into
his office tomorrow.

28:26.925 --> 28:28.517
Well, you'll just
have to face it, Mom.

28:28.560 --> 28:29.788
Your husband's a
major power player

28:29.828 --> 28:31.125
in the game of life.

28:31.163 --> 28:32.994
Now, about all this red
meat we've been eating.

28:33.031 --> 28:34.862
You know, Dad ain't
getting any younger

28:34.900 --> 28:36.333
and the chances of a...

28:36.368 --> 28:38.097
lt's Abby Malone.

28:39.437 --> 28:41.029
How are things in Buffalo;

28:42.374 --> 28:45.241
Victor committed
suicide last night.

28:46.378 --> 28:48.039
Oh, my God.

28:52.217 --> 28:53.275
Her father;

28:53.318 --> 28:55.115
l probably shouldn't
have said anything.

28:55.153 --> 28:57.417
No, l, l promise l
won't tell a soul.

28:57.455 --> 28:59.116
Yes!

28:59.157 --> 29:00.124
-Hey!
-Hi.

29:00.158 --> 29:02.285
Anybody up for dessert;

29:02.327 --> 29:03.521
Always.

29:06.531 --> 29:07.589
How many grams of fat

29:07.632 --> 29:09.463
do you think are in
one slice of this;

29:09.501 --> 29:10.695
Just enough to make it good.

29:10.735 --> 29:11.963
Guys, what are we doing;

29:12.003 --> 29:13.402
Come on, this is
Βάλερι's first night

29:13.438 --> 29:14.962
in Los Angeles and we're
sitting around here

29:15.073 --> 29:16.563
eating carrot cake;

29:16.608 --> 29:18.838
We should be going out
and showing her the town.

29:18.877 --> 29:20.174
Oh, whoa, whoa, Στιβ, Στιβ,

29:20.212 --> 29:21.975
the poor girl is
still on Eastern Time.

29:22.013 --> 29:23.844
Actually, l think l'm
getting a second wind.

29:23.882 --> 29:25.474
Well, l think Στιβ has
an excellent idea.

29:25.517 --> 29:27.747
-You should get out of the
house. -Ναι, come on.

29:27.786 --> 29:30.254
Ναι, wait. City Walk at
Universal Studios is open late.

29:30.288 --> 29:31.550
Or you can go into Hollywood,

29:31.590 --> 29:33.182
look at the footprints
outside the Chinese Theater.

29:33.225 --> 29:34.817
-Oh, that's worth seeing.
-Sounds like a plan.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.691
You know what, afterwards
we can go to Doheny's.

29:36.728 --> 29:37.990
Everyone at the beauty salon,

29:38.029 --> 29:39.656
they're saying that's
the hot new club.

29:39.698 --> 29:41.325
lsn't that the place
where Τζέσι works;

29:41.366 --> 29:42.424
Ναι, that's the place.

29:42.467 --> 29:43.866
Well, do you think l have time

29:43.902 --> 29:44.960
to go upstairs and change;

29:45.003 --> 29:46.994
l think you have time
to do whatever you want.

29:47.072 --> 29:48.505
l think l'm gonna
like it here.

30:12.264 --> 30:14.789
Hey!

30:14.833 --> 30:15.959
-All right, all right, all
right. -Hey!

30:16.001 --> 30:18.367
Whose fake l.D. did you
guys use to get in here;

30:18.403 --> 30:19.370
Oh, come on.

30:19.404 --> 30:20.837
The restaurant's
still open to us young

30:20.872 --> 30:22.134
and impressionable minors.

30:22.173 --> 30:23.697
Ναι. Besides we're
just here to dance.

30:23.742 --> 30:24.800
Speak for yourself.

30:24.843 --> 30:26.868
Hey, l don't think we've met.
l'm Τζέσι.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.140
Βάλερι.
Nice to meet you.

30:28.179 --> 30:29.203
-A pleasure.
-l'm sorry, guys.

30:29.247 --> 30:30.839
Βάλερι just moved
here from Buffalo,

30:30.882 --> 30:32.281
And Τζέσι, besides
being married to one

30:32.317 --> 30:33.511
of our closest
friends, is also

30:33.551 --> 30:34.711
on the fast track

30:34.753 --> 30:36.721
to being one of the
hottest young attorneys

30:36.755 --> 30:37.722
in Los Angeles.

30:37.756 --> 30:39.348
l gotta get out
of law school first.

30:39.391 --> 30:40.483
Details, details.

30:40.525 --> 30:42.186
What're you guys
doing here tonight;

30:42.227 --> 30:43.387
We are giving Βάλερι

30:43.428 --> 30:45.589
the inside tour
of Beverly Hills.

30:45.630 --> 30:47.063
Yes. Now l know where
Corbin Bernsen,

30:47.165 --> 30:49.065
Bruce Springsteen
and Milton Berle live.

30:49.100 --> 30:51.762
Not to mention the illustrious
Samantha Sanders.

30:51.803 --> 30:53.395
That's right, Στιβ
had to stop at home

30:53.438 --> 30:54.735
and put his dancing pumps on.

30:54.773 --> 30:55.933
Speaking of which,
what do you say

30:55.974 --> 30:56.963
-we dance;
-Okay,

30:57.008 --> 30:58.475
but l don't know
what kinda steps

30:58.510 --> 31:00.068
-you guys are doing out here.
-lt's okay.

31:00.145 --> 31:01.305
This is California.

31:01.346 --> 31:02.335
Nobody knows what they're doing.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.280
They just smile and fake it.

31:04.316 --> 31:05.340
l don't know about Στιβ

31:05.383 --> 31:07.010
but l've never had
to fake anything.

31:07.052 --> 31:09.020
Κέλυ!

31:25.203 --> 31:28.604
So, uh, Μπράντον and
Κέλυ are an item;

31:28.640 --> 31:30.608
Oh, Ναι.

31:30.642 --> 31:33.406
lt's old news already.

31:46.257 --> 31:48.623
Ντύλαν, this is lrma
from the cleaners.

31:48.660 --> 31:50.719
You dropped off a suede jacket

31:50.762 --> 31:53.253
on a rush order...

31:53.298 --> 31:55.391
and never picked it up.

31:55.433 --> 31:57.560
Please call and tell us
what to do with it.

31:57.602 --> 32:00.070
Choke on it.

32:00.105 --> 32:02.335
Hi. l'm looking for Mr. McKay.

32:02.374 --> 32:04.001
l'm Bill,
with Friends of the Bay.

32:04.042 --> 32:06.670
You really helped us out
in the past and we're hoping

32:06.711 --> 32:09.009
for a similar contribution
from you this year.

32:09.047 --> 32:10.344
Whatta you say;

32:10.382 --> 32:13.408
l wouldn't count on it, Bill.

32:14.652 --> 32:16.347
This is a long distance,

32:16.388 --> 32:19.016
person-to-person call for Ντύλαν
McKay from Μπρέντα Γουόλς.

32:19.057 --> 32:22.026
ls anyone there
to accept the charges;

32:24.729 --> 32:26.629
Yo, D. August 5th, 9:00.

32:26.664 --> 32:28.495
Μπρέντα asked me to call
and let you know

32:28.533 --> 32:29.727
she's not coming home next week.

32:29.768 --> 32:31.360
They gave her a full
scholarship to RADA

32:31.403 --> 32:33.234
so she's staying in London
for the whole year.

32:33.271 --> 32:36.035
Uh... She said she'll try you
again on the weekend.

32:36.074 --> 32:37.701
Am l a good messenger or what;

32:37.742 --> 32:38.709
Where are you, dude;

32:38.743 --> 32:39.903
Call me sometime. Later.

32:44.082 --> 32:47.711
''l will not
be in London forever.''

32:47.752 --> 32:49.049
Ναι, right.

32:50.088 --> 32:51.316
Ντύλαν, this is your mother.

32:51.356 --> 32:53.187
lsn't it just like you
to finally call me

32:53.224 --> 32:55.055
now that you've lost
all your dad's money,

32:55.093 --> 32:56.560
money l never touched.

32:56.594 --> 32:58.323
How could you
have been so stupid

32:58.363 --> 33:00.092
as to let those people...

33:10.809 --> 33:11.901
Listen, honey, l've go...

33:11.943 --> 33:13.205
l've got some Kamikazes
l've gotta make.

33:13.244 --> 33:14.973
Why don't you tell
Ντόνα all about this;

33:15.013 --> 33:17.004
That's right,
love you, too, bye.

33:17.048 --> 33:18.174
lt's ’ντρεα.

33:18.216 --> 33:20.150
Oh, thank you.

33:20.185 --> 33:22.016
Hey, l've been meaning
to call you all day.

33:22.120 --> 33:23.985
Ντόνα, what are you
doing at the bar;

33:24.022 --> 33:26.149
We're showing Μπράντον's friend
Βάλερι a good time.

33:26.191 --> 33:28.216
Oh, Ναι. l'm looking forward
to meeting her.

33:28.259 --> 33:29.521
So, how was Houston;

33:29.561 --> 33:31.028
Oh, it was great.
But never mind me.

33:31.062 --> 33:33.360
How come you didn't tell me when
you were taking the baby home;

33:33.398 --> 33:36.265
Oh, after the last fiasco we
decided to keep a low profile.

33:36.301 --> 33:38.030
We'll have a party
for her later, though.

33:38.069 --> 33:40.037
Won't we, baby, huh;

33:40.071 --> 33:42.039
Well, you better.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.335
So how's Τζέσι doing;

33:43.374 --> 33:44.841
l'd say he's coping,

33:44.876 --> 33:47.037
but l'm curious.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.307
How come he's not working
at a law firm this summer;

33:49.347 --> 33:50.939
Because he can make
more money bartending

33:50.982 --> 33:53.041
a couple nights a week
than he can clerking

33:53.084 --> 33:54.551
at the finest law firm in town.

33:54.586 --> 33:55.553
Really;

33:55.587 --> 33:56.576
Ναι. A sad commentary

33:56.621 --> 33:58.782
on the things we value
and the things we pay for.

33:58.823 --> 34:01.155
So Ντόνα, tell me, are there
a lot of lovely ladies

34:01.192 --> 34:02.386
on the premises there;

34:02.427 --> 34:04.122
No, l'm sure he'd rather
be home with you.

34:04.162 --> 34:05.754
Ναι, well he'd better
or l'll brain him.

34:06.898 --> 34:08.263
Oh, look, l gotta go.

34:08.299 --> 34:09.322
She just spit up.

34:09.367 --> 34:10.391
l'll talk to you later, okay;

34:10.435 --> 34:12.197
Okay, will do.

34:13.638 --> 34:14.866
Excuse me.

34:14.906 --> 34:16.897
Thank you.

34:16.940 --> 34:18.203
Bye, Τζέσι.

34:32.956 --> 34:34.356
Hey, Ντόνα,
come on, sit down.

34:34.391 --> 34:36.223
We're deciding on whether we
should have Buffalo wings

34:36.261 --> 34:37.626
or zucchini fritters.
What do you think;

34:37.661 --> 34:39.027
Uh, none for me.

34:39.130 --> 34:40.563
Actually, l'm a little tired.

34:40.598 --> 34:41.621
l'm gonna go home.

34:41.666 --> 34:42.757
Are you okay;

34:42.800 --> 34:44.927
Ναι, l'm fine, really.

34:44.969 --> 34:46.766
Don't mind me. l'm just, uh...

34:46.804 --> 34:49.830
l'm gonna go catch a cab.
Good night.

34:49.873 --> 34:51.341
ls she all right;

34:51.376 --> 34:52.934
Maybe not.

34:52.976 --> 34:54.034
There's young Ντέηβιντ Σίλβερ

34:54.078 --> 34:55.545
right over there.

34:58.249 --> 34:59.944
l should have known
something was wrong

34:59.984 --> 35:01.508
when she said
everything was okay.

35:08.259 --> 35:09.783
Hey, Κέλυ.

35:09.827 --> 35:11.158
Great timing.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.390
Ντόνα...

35:18.436 --> 35:19.926
Look, why don't you
wait upstairs

35:19.971 --> 35:21.905
and we'll all go home
together, okay;

35:21.940 --> 35:24.306
Thanks, but l'd
rather be alone.

35:24.342 --> 35:26.572
All right, but l'm
gonna call you later.

35:26.611 --> 35:28.841
Okay.

35:51.469 --> 35:55.235
Thank you for another wonderful
evening, Mr. Γουόλς.

35:55.273 --> 35:56.399
Oh, thank you, Miss Taylor.

35:56.441 --> 35:57.931
We ought to do it
again sometime.

35:57.976 --> 35:59.500
How about right now;

36:03.848 --> 36:06.112
Can't l persuade you
to come inside

36:06.150 --> 36:09.586
for something warm and cuddly;

36:09.621 --> 36:11.111
You know l'd love to.

36:11.155 --> 36:14.090
But seeing as
it's Βάλ's first night

36:14.125 --> 36:15.558
in the house and everything...

36:15.593 --> 36:17.254
Mm-hmm, l understand.

36:17.295 --> 36:18.592
You do;

36:18.630 --> 36:19.995
l do.

36:20.031 --> 36:20.998
You're not disappointed;

36:21.099 --> 36:22.430
No.

36:22.467 --> 36:23.934
Why would l be;

36:23.968 --> 36:27.995
When my boyfriend is
considerate and sensitive.

36:28.072 --> 36:30.700
l'm not disappointed, no,

36:30.742 --> 36:34.109
No, l just wish...

36:34.145 --> 36:36.010
Wish what;

36:36.080 --> 36:38.878
l wish you weren't so sexy.

36:50.895 --> 36:53.295
You know, l probably shouldn't
keep Στιβ and Βάλερι

36:53.331 --> 36:54.696
waiting too long.

36:54.732 --> 36:57.257
lf l know Στιβ, he's making
good use of his time.

37:02.540 --> 37:05.100
You know another thing that's
great about living on the beach

37:05.143 --> 37:08.977
in Southern California-- all
the stars come out at night.

37:09.080 --> 37:12.379
You know, Στιβ, l really hate
to break this to you,

37:12.417 --> 37:15.409
but we have stars
in upstate New York, too.

37:15.453 --> 37:18.945
Ah... but our stars
have SAG cards.

37:21.859 --> 37:24.885
Screen Actors' Guild.

37:24.929 --> 37:26.760
Little show business
humor there.

37:26.798 --> 37:28.629
Phew!

37:28.666 --> 37:30.998
You know, you've got the
most incredible eyes

37:31.102 --> 37:32.091
l have ever seen.

37:32.136 --> 37:33.831
Has anyone ever told you that;

37:33.871 --> 37:35.429
Not tonight.

37:35.473 --> 37:36.599
Well, you do.

37:36.641 --> 37:38.700
lt's kind of a cross
between Mariah Carey,

37:38.743 --> 37:41.405
Heather Locklear
and Cindy Crawford.

37:41.446 --> 37:44.006
So you're saying
l have six eyes;

37:44.082 --> 37:45.549
No, l'm saying, you have...

37:45.583 --> 37:46.550
Στιβ...

37:46.584 --> 37:50.987
if you want to kiss me,
go ahead, kiss me.

37:51.022 --> 37:53.149
Damn.

37:54.325 --> 37:56.020
Hey guys, sorry
l kept you waiting.

37:56.127 --> 37:57.389
No problem.

37:59.664 --> 38:02.098
One of you guys want to sit
in the front with me

38:02.133 --> 38:03.760
or should l change
my name to Jeeves;

38:03.801 --> 38:04.859
l will.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.534
Once around the park

38:10.575 --> 38:12.475
-and then home, kids;
-Ναι.

38:23.087 --> 38:25.783
Back to reading Anna Karenina
again, are we;

38:25.823 --> 38:29.122
Well, l've missed having
someone to wait up for.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.787
Well, they should be home soon.

38:30.828 --> 38:33.262
Τζιμ, l really appreciate
you changing your mind

38:33.297 --> 38:34.958
about letting Βάλερι
live with us.

38:34.999 --> 38:37.695
With poor Abby struggling
with the little ones,

38:37.735 --> 38:38.963
what choice did we have;

38:39.003 --> 38:43.372
Besides, Βάλερι's always
been a great kid.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.706
Couldn't turn our back
on her now, could we;

38:48.379 --> 38:51.542
Well, you must rate pretty high
to have them both stay up.

38:51.582 --> 38:52.913
Hey, what are
you talking about;

38:52.950 --> 38:54.178
l was just hungry, that's all.

38:54.218 --> 38:55.378
Ναι, you were hungry, Dad.

38:55.420 --> 38:56.978
And Mom's rediscovering
the Russian classics.

38:57.021 --> 38:58.318
Well, it is her first night

38:58.356 --> 39:00.415
in California, Μπράντον.

39:00.458 --> 39:01.720
And it was a great night.

39:01.759 --> 39:02.919
l had so much fun.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.427
l don't know who
to thank first.

39:04.462 --> 39:05.929
You don't have to thank anyone.

39:05.963 --> 39:06.952
We're always here for you.

39:06.998 --> 39:08.056
You know that, don't you;

39:08.099 --> 39:09.566
l always dreamed
it would be like this.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.067
Come here.

39:13.805 --> 39:15.136
Don't mind her.

39:15.173 --> 39:17.767
She had a couple
too many ginger ales.

39:18.843 --> 39:20.071
One.

39:20.111 --> 39:23.080
l had it together all summer
long, l really did.

39:23.114 --> 39:25.241
l mean, l didn't even shed
one tear over Ντέηβιντ.

39:25.283 --> 39:26.978
l didn't even think
of him at all.

39:27.018 --> 39:30.681
And now l see him for 15 seconds
a-and l totally go to pieces.

39:30.721 --> 39:32.689
How can he still do this to me;

39:32.723 --> 39:35.624
Because he was your first real
boyfriend, that's why.

39:35.660 --> 39:38.151
l mean, of course you're going
to have strong feelings for him.

39:38.196 --> 39:39.458
That's totally natural.

39:39.497 --> 39:42.227
Well, does he still have strong
feelings for me;

39:42.266 --> 39:43.733
Ντόνα, l don't know.

39:43.768 --> 39:45.497
Well, you talked to him.
What'd he say about me;

39:45.536 --> 39:47.163
The phone's cutting out.

39:47.205 --> 39:49.935
l'm gonna call you back
from inside, okay;

40:15.266 --> 40:16.858
You know, l think
we were both wrong.

40:16.901 --> 40:18.198
l don't think this is fixable.

40:18.236 --> 40:20.727
You know what,
maybe you were right.

40:20.771 --> 40:22.762
l think we need to start
seeing other people.

40:22.807 --> 40:24.866
Ναι, l know how that song goes.

40:24.909 --> 40:26.035
You should.

40:26.077 --> 40:27.408
You taught it to me, remember;

40:29.013 --> 40:31.174
So, this is it;

40:31.215 --> 40:33.683
That's what it looks like.

40:48.399 --> 40:51.425
Don't worry, we'll get a system
worked out for the bathroom.

40:51.469 --> 40:54.029
Well, l'm easy.

40:54.071 --> 40:56.198
So, uh, what did you
do with Μπρέντα;

40:56.240 --> 40:58.800
l'd knock. She'd stay
in here for hours.

40:58.843 --> 41:00.902
Well, knock twice if
you really have to go.

41:00.945 --> 41:02.276
Got it.

41:04.282 --> 41:06.842
l hope your first night in L.A.

41:06.884 --> 41:07.942
wasn't too overwhelming.

41:07.985 --> 41:10.647
You always were
a sweet guy, Μπράντον.

41:10.688 --> 41:12.485
Well, someone's got
to look out for you.

41:12.523 --> 41:15.458
After all, you are the
first girl l ever kissed.

41:15.493 --> 41:17.461
You showed me yours,
l showed you mine.

41:17.495 --> 41:18.621
Yes, l did.

41:18.663 --> 41:20.722
Good night, kids.

41:20.765 --> 41:22.323
Good night, Dad.

41:24.035 --> 41:25.366
You know, growing up,

41:25.403 --> 41:31.308
l... l always thought you
guys had the perfect family.

41:31.342 --> 41:33.173
Your parents
were always so warm.

41:33.210 --> 41:35.644
So much fun to be around.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.910
l have a lot of good memories
of your parents, too.

41:40.384 --> 41:43.217
You know, l used
to really envy Μπρέντα

41:43.254 --> 41:45.688
and pray that my life could
be as charmed as hers.

41:45.723 --> 41:47.588
Well, you'll be living in her
room for the next year.

41:47.625 --> 41:48.614
That's a start.

41:50.261 --> 41:52.525
Ναι, l think so.

41:55.733 --> 41:57.860
Good night, Βάλ.

41:57.902 --> 41:59.460
Good night, Μπράντον.

42:04.976 --> 42:06.204
And hurry up.

42:06.243 --> 42:07.471
Okay.

42:34.138 --> 42:36.572
Ginger, it's me.

42:36.607 --> 42:38.666
Ναι, Ναι, l know it's late,

42:38.709 --> 42:42.509
Sorry, look, l just had
to talk to somebody.

42:42.546 --> 42:45.606
l'm going out
of my mind already.

42:45.650 --> 42:48.881
Ναι, of course
l'm in Beverly Hills.

42:48.919 --> 42:51.649
No, no, l wish.

42:51.689 --> 42:55.056
lt's nothing like
l thought it would be.

42:55.159 --> 42:58.322
These people are
such avocado heads.

42:58.362 --> 43:00.353
l mean, they're so
into being from L.A.

43:00.398 --> 43:03.458
Like l really care where
Lucy and Desi used to live.

43:03.501 --> 43:06.265
No, no, l'm serious.

43:06.303 --> 43:08.294
l mean, these kids
l went out with tonight,

43:08.339 --> 43:10.307
they have got to be the
straightest human units

43:10.341 --> 43:11.706
on the planet.

43:11.742 --> 43:14.609
We went to a bar and no one
even tried to get a drink.

43:16.814 --> 43:20.409
Ναι, there is this one guy.

43:20.451 --> 43:24.387
Μπράντον's best friend,
Στιβ Sanders.

43:24.422 --> 43:26.856
Ναι. His mom's like
Samantha Sanders.

43:26.891 --> 43:28.449
As in The Hartley House;

43:28.492 --> 43:31.154
He seems kind of dumb,

43:31.195 --> 43:35.131
but l bet he gives
good credit card.

43:35.166 --> 43:37.031
The Γουόλςes;

43:37.101 --> 43:39.626
They're harmless.

43:39.670 --> 43:42.901
l'm sure everything will be cool
as long as they don't try

43:42.940 --> 43:44.737
and pull any parental trips
on me.

43:48.679 --> 43:52.342
But if they do, you know me.

43:52.383 --> 43:56.342
l'll just put on
a happy face and dance.
