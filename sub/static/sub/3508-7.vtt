<Font color=#FFFF00>Famous Last Words</font>

00:00.258 --> 00:01.237
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.264 --> 00:02.864
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.198 --> 00:04.924
psychopaths and mystery writers.

00:05.262 --> 00:06.284
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.385 --> 00:07.085
Who am I?

00:07.174 --> 00:08.313
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.314 --> 00:08.714
Castle.

00:08.748 --> 00:09.408
Castle.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.409
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.655 --> 00:13.845
Every writer needs  inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:13.955 --> 00:14.774
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:14.809 --> 00:15.829
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:15.864 --> 00:17.770
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:17.816 --> 00:19.302
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.303 --> 00:20.303
I get to be on her case.

00:20.337 --> 00:22.280
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.315 --> 00:23.191
And together, we catch killers

00:24.139 --> 00:25.127
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.228 --> 00:26.228
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.362 --> 00:27.056
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.757
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

Hey.

00:51.973 --> 00:54.207
(turns off music)
What's wrong?

00:54.375 --> 00:56.210
Dad, they're saying
she's dead.

00:56.677 --> 00:58.011
Who's dead?

00:58.279 --> 01:00.981
Hayley Blue. The Gawker
web site just posted it.

01:00.983 --> 01:02.650
Oh, the girl from the band
you like.

01:02.718 --> 01:04.986
They say they found her body
in an alley in Chelsea.

01:04.988 --> 01:06.788
Oh, Angel, are you sure
it's not just a rumor?

01:06.855 --> 01:09.356
I mean, those gossip blogs,
they don't really check facts.

01:09.424 --> 01:10.158
They were right when they said

01:10.226 --> 01:12.060
Hayley was breaking up
the band to go solo.

01:12.228 --> 01:13.862
Look, if there was
any truth to it,

01:13.930 --> 01:15.664
I'm sure Detective Beckett
would've called by now.

01:16.732 --> 01:18.800
(cell phone rings)

01:18.867 --> 01:20.902
(rings and beeps)

01:24.739 --> 01:25.973
(sighs)

01:26.541 --> 01:30.677
<i>(music playing indistinctly)</i>

01:30.845 --> 01:32.112
(Perlmutter)
Broken neck.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.481
At least, that's my prelim.

01:34.549 --> 01:36.917
No wallet, no phone, no ID.

01:37.685 --> 01:38.786
She doesn't need ID.

01:38.954 --> 01:39.821
You know her?

01:40.889 --> 01:42.990
- Are you sure it's her?
- That's Hayley Blue.

01:43.057 --> 01:45.426
I took Alexis to see her band,
the Blue Pill, last year.

01:45.694 --> 01:46.562
What happened?

01:46.563 --> 01:48.463
Well, it looks like
she was killed off-site,

01:48.530 --> 01:49.965
then brought here and staged.

01:50.266 --> 01:51.366
Time of death?

01:51.433 --> 01:54.802
Uh, I'd say between midnight
and 3:00 am, give or take.

01:55.470 --> 01:57.771
<i>(music continues)
Do you guys hear that?</i>

01:57.839 --> 02:00.074
- What?
- The song...it's playing again.

02:00.141 --> 02:03.510
<i>(music continues)</i>

02:03.578 --> 02:06.613
(camera shutter clicking)

02:06.781 --> 02:08.216
It's on repeat.

02:09.383 --> 02:11.618
"Here, Kitty Kitty" by the Blue Pills.
It's one of hers.

02:11.886 --> 02:13.588
Well, that's gotta be
a message, right?

02:13.655 --> 02:14.856
All right, have CSU bag this,

02:14.924 --> 02:16.825
check the body...
fibers, prints, the whole works.

02:17.393 --> 02:19.193
Guy could've tossed the body
in a dumpster.

02:19.261 --> 02:20.962
Instead he hangs her
from a fire escape.

02:21.230 --> 02:22.798
He is sending a message.

02:27.401 --> 02:28.669
(Montgomery)
It's about time you got back.

02:28.737 --> 02:29.971
We've got a very persistent citizen

02:30.038 --> 02:31.173
waiting to ask you some questions.

02:32.541 --> 02:34.809
Alexis, what are you doing here?

02:34.876 --> 02:36.145
How come you're not at school?

02:36.146 --> 02:38.246
Oh, I have study hall first period.
Dad, is it true?

02:38.713 --> 02:41.349
Uh, yeah, sweetie.
I'm afraid so.

02:42.016 --> 02:43.184
What happened, was it the drugs?

02:43.652 --> 02:46.054
Doesn't look like it. Why?
Did she have a drug problem?

02:46.055 --> 02:47.055
Well, she used to.

02:47.122 --> 02:48.156
She went to rehab a few months ago

02:48.224 --> 02:49.426
after her friend found her
choking on her own...

02:49.427 --> 02:51.727
Okay. You know, I...
you know what? I think it's time

02:51.793 --> 02:53.428
we reset the parental controls
on your computer.

02:53.429 --> 02:56.429
Please. I had to set parental control
on your computer. Remember?

02:56.496 --> 02:57.731
- Speaking of which...
- No.

02:58.498 --> 02:59.266
(Esposito)
Beckett.

02:59.334 --> 02:59.834
Yeah.

02:59.901 --> 03:01.302
Street was negative for cameras.

03:01.570 --> 03:04.238
We got a dozen shoe prints off
the alley, size 5 through 11.

03:04.306 --> 03:06.039
Checked her DMV records online,

03:06.107 --> 03:08.342
she moved from the address they
have listed three months ago.

03:08.609 --> 03:10.579
That was about the same time
that Hayley went into rehab.

03:10.580 --> 03:11.980
(Ryan)
But check this out.

03:12.446 --> 03:14.414
I ran a search for that song
on Hayley's iPod,

03:14.482 --> 03:15.582
"Here, Kitty Kitty."

03:15.650 --> 03:16.717
Look what popped up.

03:16.885 --> 03:19.954
<i>♪ I can see the writing

03:19.955 --> 03:20.955

03:35.203 --> 03:36.204
Is that how you found her?

03:36.271 --> 03:37.972
Does that mean anything to you?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.374
Yeah. Hayley wrote this song

03:40.442 --> 03:42.076
About some obsessed fan
who was stalking her.

03:42.077 --> 03:43.077
Do you know who he was?

03:43.544 --> 03:44.745
Wait. There might be
something in the song.

03:44.813 --> 03:46.480
Play it again.

03:46.548 --> 03:49.716
<i>♪ it's okay to want me,

03:50.084 --> 03:51.552

03:52.619 --> 03:53.720

03:53.788 --> 03:54.855
"sitting back and plotting."

03:55.323 --> 03:56.291
Sounds like she thought
he was dangerous.

03:56.292 --> 03:57.592
Yeah. Listen, here's the part.

03:57.659 --> 04:01.228
<i>♪ does 50 feet or less
mean anything to you at all? ♪</i>

04:02.096 --> 04:03.332
"50 feet or less."

04:03.633 --> 04:05.133
She got a restraining order
against him.

04:05.199 --> 04:06.401
All right, run it and get me a name.

04:07.269 --> 04:10.703
And you... will go off to school.

04:10.771 --> 04:13.306
- But I was just helpful.
- Yes, but if I let you out of class

04:13.308 --> 04:14.908
every time you were helpful,
you'd never go.

04:14.910 --> 04:16.410
But I won't be able to focus
on school today.

04:16.411 --> 04:18.346
- I just can't concentrate.
- Which would make you

04:18.413 --> 04:19.714
just like all the other kids
in your class.

04:19.714 --> 04:20.515
Dad.

04:20.522 --> 04:22.551
I am serious. Or I will call
the truant officer.

04:22.618 --> 04:25.186
- Do you still have truant officers?
- Budget cuts.

04:25.354 --> 04:26.422
Oh, you're so lucky.

04:27.323 --> 04:28.423
Found your stalker.

04:28.789 --> 04:31.124
Franco Marquez--
AKA Frankie Markie.

04:31.192 --> 04:33.394
Hayley filed half a dozen
complaints against him.

04:33.461 --> 04:36.263
It says here that he even tried
to break into her apartment.

04:36.331 --> 04:38.632
And when she filed against him,
he showed up in court

04:38.700 --> 04:39.702
and he called her a...

04:42.570 --> 04:43.904
B-I-T-C-H.

04:44.472 --> 04:46.373
She can spell, Detective.

04:46.441 --> 04:47.541
Probably better than you.

04:47.709 --> 04:48.710
Bring him in.

04:49.178 --> 04:50.712
And you, to school.

04:51.479 --> 04:52.880
- Fine.
- Thank you.

04:59.921 --> 05:01.054
What?

05:01.122 --> 05:02.258
Nothing.

05:03.459 --> 05:04.759
It's just, I'm so used to you

05:04.825 --> 05:06.494
acting like a 12 year old
all of the time.

05:06.561 --> 05:07.996
It's kind of refreshing
see you as a father.

05:08.397 --> 05:09.597
Makes you want me, right?

05:10.064 --> 05:11.599
And there's the 12 year old again.

05:12.066 --> 05:14.968
- Who are you calling?
- Ellison-King Rehab Center.

05:15.036 --> 05:16.904
It's where all the stars go
to clean up. I figured Hayley

05:16.971 --> 05:19.006
must have given them her home
address on her exit interview.

05:19.074 --> 05:21.342
If Hayley cleaned up.
That's where she would've gone.

05:23.878 --> 05:26.480
Mrs. Busch, the rehab center
said that you and your husband

05:26.548 --> 05:27.348
paid for her treatment,

05:27.416 --> 05:29.885
and that she moved in with you
after she left the facility.

05:29.886 --> 05:30.886
Yeah.

05:31.352 --> 05:32.586
She'd become like family.

05:33.354 --> 05:34.721
(Castle)
Do all record producers

05:34.789 --> 05:36.090
pay for their artists
to go to rehab?

05:36.157 --> 05:38.959
No, most just score them drugs
and then look the other way.

05:39.627 --> 05:41.562
Their manager gets 'em
some pot so they can relax.

05:42.030 --> 05:44.564
The producer gets them
some blow so they can...

05:44.832 --> 05:46.366
so they can work.

05:47.034 --> 05:48.502
Then someone gets 'em heroin.

05:49.070 --> 05:52.006
By the time we got to Hayley,
she was already hooked.

05:52.774 --> 05:54.474
We told her our door
was always open

05:54.542 --> 05:55.444
if she wanted to get clean.

05:55.545 --> 05:57.745
She was always better than that band.
She was the talent.

05:58.213 --> 05:59.948
Well, when they finally broke up,

06:00.515 --> 06:02.184
She wanted off the drugs,
so we took her in.

06:02.585 --> 06:03.385
She was ready.

06:03.752 --> 06:06.720
She recording again.
And to be killed by a fan..

06:07.088 --> 06:09.390
Actually, we don't know
for sure that it was Franco.

06:09.491 --> 06:11.091
- You don't?
- No.

06:11.258 --> 06:12.593
But you weren't there
in the middle of the night

06:12.661 --> 06:14.062
when she was waking up screaming,

06:14.430 --> 06:16.331
terrified that something
like this was gonna happen.

06:17.099 --> 06:18.366
We were supposed to protect her.

06:19.334 --> 06:21.102
We should've tried harder
to find her.

06:21.204 --> 06:22.304
To find her?

06:22.570 --> 06:25.339
Last Monday, she didn't show up
at the studio for a session.

06:25.807 --> 06:27.108
When we got home, she was gone,

06:27.176 --> 06:29.610
so were her clothes,
her watch, her jewelry...

06:29.678 --> 06:30.712
anything she could sell.

06:32.013 --> 06:33.613
- We figured..
- She had relapsed.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.083
We tried calling her, but her
cell phone was disconnected.

06:36.150 --> 06:38.986
It, you know, it wasn't
like her to just disappear.

06:39.454 --> 06:40.488
Something spooked her.

06:41.055 --> 06:42.390
Did Hayley have any family?

06:42.457 --> 06:45.159
Yeah. A sister. Sky.

06:46.027 --> 06:46.996
Do you know where we could find her?

06:47.397 --> 06:49.497
Wherever she is, she probably
has a needle in her arm.

06:49.864 --> 06:50.999
When Hayley got out of rehab,

06:51.166 --> 06:52.834
all she could talk about
was saving Sky.

06:53.902 --> 06:56.804
Not that Sky wanted saving
after what Hayley did to her.

06:56.872 --> 06:58.106
What did Hayley do to her?

06:59.074 --> 07:00.241
She got famous.

07:01.309 --> 07:03.310
(cell phone rings)

07:03.377 --> 07:05.011
Oh, excuse me.

07:05.079 --> 07:07.681
(rings and beeps)

07:07.748 --> 07:08.715
Beckett.

07:08.883 --> 07:10.250
Our fanatic fan is rabbiting.

07:10.318 --> 07:12.486
A neighbor saw him leaving
with a backpack this morning.

07:12.754 --> 07:14.822
From the looks of his place,
he left in a hurry.

07:15.089 --> 07:16.157
Any idea where he was going?

07:16.158 --> 07:17.258
Yeah. Away.

07:17.325 --> 07:19.627
He also charged a bus ticket
at Port Authority this morning.

07:19.728 --> 07:20.728
He's headed upstate.

07:20.795 --> 07:22.530
Bus pulled out five minutes ago.
You hear that?

07:22.697 --> 07:23.798
Yeah.

07:29.804 --> 07:31.438

Franco Marquez,
you're under arrest

08:26.728 --> 08:29.196
for the murder of Hayley Blue.

08:29.264 --> 08:31.165
(Esposito)
Get up. Get up here!

08:31.232 --> 08:33.667
Easy! Easy, man!
God, you're hurting me!

08:34.534 --> 08:36.535

Original Air Date on November 2, 2009

08:43.089 --> 08:45.823
<i>You guys are so stupid.</i>

08:46.491 --> 08:48.759
I loved Hayley.
She was my soul mate.

08:48.927 --> 08:49.894
Why would I kill her?!

08:50.162 --> 08:51.397
Why did you run?

08:51.398 --> 08:53.398
(scoffs)
When I heard how you found her,

08:53.465 --> 08:54.365
I knew what you'd think.

08:54.533 --> 08:57.435
Oh, she wrote a song about me,
so of course I must have k--

08:58.503 --> 09:00.338
Where were you
after midnight last night?

09:02.006 --> 09:03.941
She played a set
at the Bitter End last night...

09:05.009 --> 09:06.143
Brand-new song.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.112
It was, like, a total surprise.

09:08.179 --> 09:10.081
Like, there was no e-mail blast
or nothing, so I wasn't there.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.450
I asked you where you were,
not where you weren't.

09:13.018 --> 09:16.020
Someone recorded the concert
and posted it online.

09:16.087 --> 09:17.322
It's gone totally viral already.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.491
So that's where I was...
at home in my room

09:20.559 --> 09:22.694
listening to Hayley's final show.

09:22.762 --> 09:25.697
You say final show like you knew
it was gonna be her last.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.299
I did know. So did Hayley.

09:30.067 --> 09:32.137
She knew last night she was gonna die.

09:34.205 --> 09:37.172
Listen.
(sighs)

09:37.179 --> 09:39.043
<i>(guitar music playing)</i>

09:40.811 --> 09:41.746
Her new song.

09:42.813 --> 09:44.148
<i>♪ the hands we're dealt ♪</i>

09:44.215 --> 09:47.819
<i>♪ will never disappear ♪</i>

09:48.987 --> 09:54.459
<i>♪ death, she grows near ♪</i>

09:57.262 --> 09:59.129
"death, she grows near"?

09:59.997 --> 10:01.499
She knew he was gonna killer
last night.

10:01.566 --> 10:02.902
And he knew he would frame me
when he did.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.403
Who are you talking about?

10:04.970 --> 10:06.437
I know I'm not supposed to,
but...

10:06.505 --> 10:09.040
The restraining order...
I followed her.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.510
I came around the corner,
he was yelling at her.

10:13.778 --> 10:15.179
He said he was gonna kill her.

10:15.247 --> 10:16.214
Who said?

10:18.082 --> 10:19.517
Franco, who did you see?

10:20.084 --> 10:21.153
Zack Metzger,

10:22.820 --> 10:24.255
her guitarist.

10:24.622 --> 10:27.558
Zack Metzger, guitar God...
juvie records are sealed,

10:27.626 --> 10:29.528
but he's got a half a dozen
priors as an adult.

10:29.595 --> 10:31.430
Couple of 'em are
domestic assaults, too.

10:31.698 --> 10:35.199
Apparently, he likes to hit women.
(Castle) Look at this guy.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.235
If I was a woman, I'd just him back.

10:37.402 --> 10:38.738
Does he look like a killer to you?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.639
Everybody looks like
a killer to me, Castle.

10:40.705 --> 10:42.107
Job requirement.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.711
- Do I look like a killer to you?
- Yes, you kill my patience.

10:47.278 --> 10:50.580
Hey. So... I just took a report

10:50.648 --> 10:52.683
from the receiving officer
at the 20th Precinct.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.252
He recognized Hayley from the news.

10:54.419 --> 10:55.388
And?

10:55.389 --> 10:56.989
He says Hayley
showed up at their door

10:57.056 --> 10:59.057
to file a report
the day she went missing.

10:59.324 --> 11:01.092
- About what?
- He doesn't know.

11:01.759 --> 11:02.994
She asked to speak with a detective.

11:03.061 --> 11:04.863
By the time
the receiving officer found one,

11:04.931 --> 11:06.067
She'd skipped out.

11:06.468 --> 11:09.368
There's only one reason you go
to the cops...to report a crime.

11:09.535 --> 11:11.670
or to get help because
you think you're in danger.

11:12.037 --> 11:15.506
(rock music playing)

11:17.309 --> 11:19.210
(man speaks indistinctly)

11:19.278 --> 11:21.446
(music continues)

11:21.513 --> 11:24.148
(man) Hang on a second.
I think we've got company.

11:24.216 --> 11:25.650
(song ends)

11:25.818 --> 11:27.787
(man) Careful with that guitar
when you put that away.

11:30.855 --> 11:32.523
We heard about what happened to Hayley.

11:33.491 --> 11:34.427
Sucks, right?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.028
Can I get you a tissue?

11:36.594 --> 11:38.229
We have a witness who saw
you guys fighting.

11:38.297 --> 11:40.998
- (chuckles) So?
- So she's dead now.

11:41.566 --> 11:43.768
- Well, I didn't kill her.
- Are you sure about that?

11:44.336 --> 11:46.036
You sure you didn't
get a little high,

11:46.304 --> 11:48.339
Maybe pull a "Hulk smash"
on your band mate?

11:49.507 --> 11:51.542
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.
- Where were you

11:51.610 --> 11:53.978
between midnight
and 3:00 am on Sunday night?

11:54.746 --> 11:55.480
We had a gig.

11:57.147 --> 11:59.582
Gillespie Sweet 16 over on 82nd.

11:59.650 --> 12:00.684
We finished around 1:30.

12:00.752 --> 12:02.519
We packed up
and we were out by 2:00.

12:02.687 --> 12:04.722
Me and Nick shared a cab
to Williamsburg.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.024
I paid with a credit card.
Are we done?

12:07.092 --> 12:09.527
Wow. Sweet 16 parties.

12:09.794 --> 12:12.163
When Hayley was with the band,
weren't you opening for Pink?

12:12.230 --> 12:13.532
What do you guys want me to say?

12:13.600 --> 12:16.435
Okay, she screwed all of us
when she had her little meltdown

12:16.503 --> 12:17.637
and decided to go solo.

12:17.704 --> 12:20.640
Do I hate her? Yes.
Did I kill her? No.

12:20.641 --> 12:21.641
What'd you guys fight about?

12:22.508 --> 12:24.975
(sighs)
Her being a selfish bitch.

12:26.143 --> 12:26.877
She found out that

12:26.945 --> 12:28.546
we were holding auditions
for her replacement.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.582
and she had those
d-bag producers send us

12:30.650 --> 12:33.685
<i>- a cease and resist letter.
- Or a cease and desist letter.</i>

12:35.253 --> 12:37.721
We made the reputation
for the name "Blue Pill,"

12:37.989 --> 12:39.056
but she owned it.

12:39.124 --> 12:42.426
So what? She has a meltdown
and disappears off the map,

12:42.494 --> 12:44.896
A-a-and we can't use
our own damn name?

12:45.164 --> 12:47.033
Hell, we can't even
get arrested now.

12:47.634 --> 12:48.834
Poor choice of words.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.301
(cell phone rings)

12:50.369 --> 12:51.469
(beeps)

12:51.537 --> 12:53.104
Beckett.

12:54.872 --> 12:55.873
Okay.

12:57.541 --> 12:59.210
Hayley's sister
is on her way to the morgue

12:59.277 --> 13:00.312
to identify the body.

13:01.479 --> 13:02.314
Don't leave town.

13:02.381 --> 13:04.749
(woman) ♪ one more time
is what I cry ♪

13:05.617 --> 13:06.651
But feel free to bathe.

13:06.818 --> 13:10.053
♪ whenever I begin to drown ♪

13:10.055 --> 13:11.655
Yeah, we need security
down here right away.

13:11.721 --> 13:12.356
(woman)
Who's the stupid bitch now, huh?!

13:12.424 --> 13:13.691
You are!
Who's the dead one now, huh?

13:13.759 --> 13:15.060
(woman shouting indistinctly)
what's going on in there?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.328
Uh, Hayley Blue's sister Sky

13:17.496 --> 13:20.364
is having a very emotional reaction
to her sister's death.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.599
You hypocrite!
Who's dead now, huh?

13:22.667 --> 13:23.701
- You are!
- Sky?

13:25.570 --> 13:26.504
Ow.

13:28.172 --> 13:30.739
What do you want?
'cause I'm talking to my sister.

13:31.307 --> 13:32.676
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

13:32.744 --> 13:34.812
I'd like to ask you a few
questions, if that's okay.

13:35.479 --> 13:37.014
- You're a cop?
- Yeah.

13:37.782 --> 13:39.950
- Is that a knife?
- Am I breaking the law?

13:40.518 --> 13:41.619
Yeah.

13:41.886 --> 13:42.786

13:43.554 --> 13:44.555

14:01.439 --> 14:03.006
I think I might have killed her.

14:14.490 --> 14:15.824
How did you kill her?

14:15.991 --> 14:18.293
I told her to do the world
a favor and drop dead.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.527
And then she did.

14:19.695 --> 14:21.464
It's funny. She usually
doesn't listen to me.

14:21.831 --> 14:24.301
Why would you tell her
to drop dead? She's your sister.

14:24.302 --> 14:25.302
She was an ass.

14:26.068 --> 14:27.403
When did you see her last?

14:27.404 --> 14:28.904
I don't know--
Wednesday, Thursday.

14:29.071 --> 14:31.140
- What day is it today?
- Where'd you see her?

14:38.246 --> 14:40.814
She found me selling a bracelet

14:40.882 --> 14:43.251
that she bought me for my birthday.

14:43.618 --> 14:45.086
Do you know where she was staying?

14:45.454 --> 14:47.488
No, not since she left
Bree and Ian's--

14:47.556 --> 14:48.990
The church of holier than thou.

14:49.258 --> 14:50.525
She said she was going off the grid.

14:50.593 --> 14:51.527
She didn't even have a phone.

14:52.295 --> 14:54.562
Secret agent clean and sober--
Hayley Blue.

14:54.830 --> 14:57.266
- Why'd she leave their place?
- She always leaves.

14:58.434 --> 15:01.836
You said she was
looking for you last week.

15:01.904 --> 15:04.539
Yeah. She had something
to tell me, something important.

15:04.707 --> 15:05.642
What?

15:05.643 --> 15:07.543
I don't know, 'cause I told her
to go screw herself.

15:08.210 --> 15:09.978
I mean, I really don't need her
trying to fix me

15:10.046 --> 15:12.180
or trying to save me
or making promises

15:12.248 --> 15:14.582
<i>That she knew she wasn't
gonna be able to keep.</i>

15:14.650 --> 15:17.519
- What promises would she make?
- She said that I could come back.

15:17.687 --> 15:19.722
She said that we were gonna be a team.

15:20.990 --> 15:22.824
But I had to get clean.

15:23.792 --> 15:24.860
"you gotta clean up, baby girl.

15:24.867 --> 15:26.462
You're gonna end up dead."

15:26.729 --> 15:29.030
Hmm. Thus, irony.

15:29.898 --> 15:31.266
How was I supposed to get clean...

15:32.333 --> 15:33.835
When she couldn't even do it?

15:34.102 --> 15:35.670
Wait a minute.
She was using again?

15:35.738 --> 15:38.073
Yeah, she was with Tony
the day after I saw her.

15:38.074 --> 15:39.174
Who's Tony?

15:39.341 --> 15:40.909
My dealer.

15:41.476 --> 15:42.911
She was handing him a wad of cash.

15:47.015 --> 15:49.016
I was just thinking,
if she was using again,

15:49.083 --> 15:50.918
that would explain
why she left her producers,

15:51.185 --> 15:52.486
but not why she was killed,

15:52.554 --> 15:55.088
who killed her
or why she went to the police.

15:55.156 --> 15:56.891
What I just said
was not confusing enough

15:56.959 --> 15:58.327
for your face to do what it's doing.

15:58.328 --> 15:59.328
That was Perlmutter.

15:59.695 --> 16:01.596
The tox results
just got back from the lab.

16:01.664 --> 16:03.598
There were no drugs
in Hayley's system.

16:03.666 --> 16:05.400
She was 100% clean and sober.

16:05.668 --> 16:07.602
Then why was she giving
a wad of cash

16:07.670 --> 16:08.737
to Tony the drug dealer?

16:14.076 --> 16:16.045
She didn't want drugs.
She wanted a gun.

16:16.346 --> 16:17.146
A gun?

16:17.212 --> 16:18.547
Not a punk-ass .22 either.

16:18.614 --> 16:20.749
A .38. She wanted to put
a hole in a brother.

16:21.217 --> 16:23.719
Seeing as she's dead, I say I
did the right thing at the time.

16:24.187 --> 16:25.321
The girl was scared.

16:25.322 --> 16:26.422
Of what?

16:26.589 --> 16:28.423
Didn't say, and I didn't ask.

16:29.191 --> 16:30.492
She just wanted the gun.

16:32.460 --> 16:33.362
Are you sure?

16:33.363 --> 16:34.663
(Perlmutter) You telling me
how to do my job?

16:34.665 --> 16:36.965
No, Perlmutter. I'm not trying
to tell you how to do your job.

16:36.966 --> 16:38.166
Good,
'cause that's all you get.

16:38.866 --> 16:41.769
Hello? He just hung up on me.

16:42.537 --> 16:43.872
There's a reason he hangs out
with dead people.

16:43.939 --> 16:44.774
So what did he say?

16:44.875 --> 16:46.775
He identified the lipstick
that was used

16:46.842 --> 16:49.177
to paint a smile on Hayley's face

16:49.244 --> 16:50.946
as Daniella Bolan's Velvet Kiss
lipstick--Lava Red.

16:50.947 --> 16:52.147
Yes, but what about the gun?
What'd he say about the gun?

16:52.314 --> 16:53.782
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

16:54.350 --> 16:56.552
They found gunpowder residue
on Hayley's hands.

16:56.819 --> 16:59.455
So not only did she buy a gun,
but she used it.

16:59.522 --> 17:00.792
But why didn't we find it?

17:00.793 --> 17:02.693
That's because we didn't
find her where she was killed.

17:02.759 --> 17:06.527
So someone attacked her,
someone that she was afraid of.

17:06.694 --> 17:08.797
She tries to shoot them,
and in the struggle,

17:08.864 --> 17:10.933
the assailant breaks her neck,
drags her down an alleyway,

17:11.000 --> 17:12.867
hangs her upside down,
paints a smile on her face,

17:12.935 --> 17:17.505
which apparently
was a lot like a music video

17:17.571 --> 17:19.173
that has nothing to do
with our murder.

17:19.441 --> 17:21.242
You thought you sounded so smart

17:21.310 --> 17:22.645
when you started that sentence,
didn't you?

17:22.646 --> 17:24.246
Okay, Mr. Mystery writer man,

17:24.313 --> 17:25.580
what's your best-selling theory?

17:25.982 --> 17:27.182
I'm gonna go with the butler.

17:27.249 --> 17:28.117
The butler?

17:28.118 --> 17:30.119
That's who we always go with
when we run out of ideas.

17:30.586 --> 17:32.420
- How about Alexis?
- Oh, Alexis.

17:32.488 --> 17:33.923
She's perfect...
she's peripheral to the case,

17:34.090 --> 17:35.693
We don't suspect her,
she has no alibi.

17:36.894 --> 17:38.294
Okay, I'll tell you what,
why don't you go home

17:38.361 --> 17:40.196
and question her?
And if she breaks, call me.

17:42.764 --> 17:43.898
(Castle)
Hey.

17:44.566 --> 17:47.568
If you killed someone,
you would tell me, right?

17:48.336 --> 17:49.704
<i>Of course.
(music playing indistinctly)</i>

17:50.472 --> 17:51.806
I'd need help hiding the body.

17:51.874 --> 17:54.041
Ah ha ha.
That's my girl.

17:54.109 --> 17:55.877
- Hi, darling.
- Did you get my texts?

17:55.944 --> 17:58.012
Yeah. Did you really meet
the rest of the Blue Pill?

17:58.080 --> 18:01.683
Yes, I did, and all I can
say is, admire them from afar.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.219
What are you listening to?

18:03.220 --> 18:05.820
(Martha)
It's Hayley's last performance.

18:05.887 --> 18:09.289
<i>Oy! She hasn't stopped
listening to it all night.</i>

18:09.957 --> 18:10.458
It's called "Threshold."

18:10.525 --> 18:12.326
Oh, yeah.
It's, uh, it's pretty.

18:12.394 --> 18:14.095
A little creepy, though.

18:14.162 --> 18:15.864
- Very creepy.
- How's it creepy?

18:16.031 --> 18:18.800
"death, she grows near"?
It's kinda like "Final Destination,"

18:18.867 --> 18:19.903
but in song form.

18:20.104 --> 18:22.004
She doesn't mean "death" death.

18:22.171 --> 18:23.806
Well, what other kinds
of death are there?

18:23.973 --> 18:26.741
Allegorical, metaphoric,
symbolic, spiritual,

18:26.809 --> 18:27.944
Emotional, sexual...

18:27.945 --> 18:30.645
Ah, o-okay, okay.
That's quite enough.

18:30.812 --> 18:32.380
I think I'm paying
far too much for her education.

18:32.448 --> 18:35.049
I think this one's symbolic.
Hayley was into all sorts of

18:35.117 --> 18:38.886
new age-y imagery...
uh, Numerology, Astrology, Tarot.

18:38.888 --> 18:41.688
and in Tarot, the death card
doesn't symbolize dying.

18:41.757 --> 18:44.225
It symbolizes transformation,
change.

18:44.233 --> 18:45.260
Listen.

18:45.261 --> 18:46.261
(computer beeps,
volume increases)

18:46.328 --> 18:47.529
<i>♪ the hands we're dealt ♪</i>

18:47.597 --> 18:50.799
<i>♪ will never disappear ♪</i>

18:50.800 --> 18:51.600
(beep, song pauses)

18:51.666 --> 18:54.135
"the hands we're dealt,"
like she's having her cards read.

18:54.302 --> 18:55.970
"death grows near"
means change is coming.

18:56.038 --> 18:59.640
Oh, oh, that reminds me of
sitting around with Lisa Olsen

18:59.708 --> 19:02.109
trying to decode the Beatles' lyrics...

19:02.117 --> 19:04.278
Spinning the record backwards
and to see if, uh,

19:04.346 --> 19:05.713
Paul was dead.

19:05.781 --> 19:07.215
And who could forget
the countless hours

19:08.283 --> 19:10.485
I spent pondering the lyrics to
Van Halen's "Hot for Teacher"? Mm.

19:10.853 --> 19:13.221
(cell phone rings and beeps,
e-mail signal dings)

19:13.288 --> 19:15.456
(laughs)
Sounds like a drama is afoot.

19:15.524 --> 19:16.893
Who kissed whom
at which bleachers?

19:16.894 --> 19:18.494
No, it's the official
Blue Pill web site.

19:19.461 --> 19:20.261
There's a new thread

19:20.263 --> 19:21.763
Talking about the band
getting back together.

19:22.029 --> 19:23.231
What?

19:23.499 --> 19:24.433
Look at this.

19:25.601 --> 19:27.936
"Sky Blue is supposed to take
Hayley's place as lead singer.

19:28.303 --> 19:29.670
"this is all but a done deal.

19:30.238 --> 19:32.506
"I heard they're starting
rehearsals right away.

19:32.574 --> 19:34.775
- OMG! OMG! OMG!"
- and look at this one.

19:34.843 --> 19:36.544
"a source
at John McGinnis Management

19:36.612 --> 19:37.746
"confirmed it when I called...

19:37.814 --> 19:39.415
The Blue Pill is definitely
getting back together."

19:39.883 --> 19:41.051
"the Hayley Blue tribute tour."

19:41.152 --> 19:42.852
I thought you said Hayley
wouldn't let the band

19:42.919 --> 19:44.553
- have the name back.
- She wouldn't.

19:44.620 --> 19:45.589
Then how can they use it?

19:45.590 --> 19:48.390
Well, Hayley is dead
and Sky's her only family.

19:48.457 --> 19:50.592
If Hayley owned the name,
then it would go to Sky.

19:50.593 --> 19:52.493
You don't think
Sky killed her own sister?

19:52.560 --> 19:54.829
Sky is 100 pounds dripping wet.

19:54.896 --> 19:56.633
The only neck she could break
is her own.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.735
"John McGinnis Management."
who's John McGinnis?

20:00.802 --> 20:03.270
Hayley's old manager. She fired
him when she got clean.

20:03.538 --> 20:05.105
She didn't say his name,

20:05.173 --> 20:06.674
but in her interview
in "Spin" last month,

20:06.741 --> 20:08.876
she pretty much implied
that he's the one

20:08.944 --> 20:10.614
that got her hooked
to begin with.

20:10.615 --> 20:13.115
If the band got back together,
he'd have the most to gain.

20:13.482 --> 20:15.783
Now does that man look like
a killer to you?

20:15.851 --> 20:17.885
Everybody looks
like a killer to me.

20:18.053 --> 20:19.754
It's a job requirement.

20:20.221 --> 20:22.290
You didn't say that about Sky.

20:22.358 --> 20:24.659
Just... Let me have
this moment.

20:27.573 --> 20:28.740
I told you...

20:28.808 --> 20:31.143
Sunday night, I was in Philly
scouting a band.

20:31.210 --> 20:34.012
I hit a motel, I watched
a little pay-per-view,

20:34.079 --> 20:37.049
and I went to bed, which may
say something about my taste,

20:37.416 --> 20:39.418
but it does not make me a criminal.

20:39.586 --> 20:40.653
But your rap sheet does.

20:41.821 --> 20:43.922
Six counts of misdemeanor possession,

20:43.990 --> 20:47.258
two counts of felony possession
with the intent to distribute.

20:47.426 --> 20:48.660
(Castle)
What'd you do, McGinnis,

20:49.328 --> 20:50.229
Give 'em a little taste,

20:50.697 --> 20:53.931
Make 'em need you,
make 'em depend on you?

20:54.399 --> 20:55.734
You want to know what I do?

20:56.502 --> 20:58.436
I make things happen.

20:59.204 --> 21:00.438
When I met Hayley and her sister,

21:00.506 --> 21:01.740
they were playing open mikes

21:01.807 --> 21:04.109
at coffeehouses in the East Village.

21:04.677 --> 21:06.478
Who do you think got her
a vocal coach?

21:06.545 --> 21:08.179
Who paid for her stylist?

21:08.247 --> 21:11.582
I took a third-rate...
a third-rate...Miley Cyrus

21:11.650 --> 21:13.785
and turned her into
the next Gwen Stefani,

21:13.852 --> 21:15.620
and right before my payoff,

21:16.688 --> 21:18.756
she walks away.

21:19.224 --> 21:20.925
I... I... (mutters)

21:20.993 --> 21:22.427
And since she owned
the band name,

21:22.495 --> 21:23.995
your hands were tied.

21:24.463 --> 21:25.697
But now that she's dead,

21:25.765 --> 21:28.299
All you needed to do
was rope in Sky.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.468
(laughs) Look...

21:31.236 --> 21:32.137
the way I see it,

21:32.705 --> 21:36.240
the band gets back together,
everybody makes a lot of money,

21:36.408 --> 21:37.742
Everybody's happy.

21:37.810 --> 21:40.878
Except for Hayley, because she's dead.

21:40.946 --> 21:44.248
Which will no doubt
help us sell lots of tickets

21:44.316 --> 21:45.750
when the band goes back on tour.

21:46.418 --> 21:47.520
Is that why you killed her?

21:51.522 --> 21:54.192
Now I know my rights here,
and I'm done talking.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.762
You think you got a case?
Arrest me.

21:57.830 --> 22:00.866
I would love to have
that kind of publicity.

22:01.533 --> 22:04.202
I never fully appreciated
the nuances of the word "skeevy"

22:04.270 --> 22:05.970
<i>Until just now.</i>

22:06.238 --> 22:07.806
Hey, Ryan, did you get
the phone records

22:07.874 --> 22:10.109
for John McGinnis
and McGinnis management?

22:10.410 --> 22:11.410
Yeah, just got 'em.

22:12.277 --> 22:15.146
- You don't think he did it?
- He challenged me to arrest him.

22:15.413 --> 22:16.214
He's probably screwed

22:16.282 --> 22:17.749
and figures bluffing
is his best bet.

22:18.217 --> 22:20.452
Ryan, let's cross-reference
his calls with our hit list,

22:20.520 --> 22:21.588
find out if he was in contact

22:21.655 --> 22:23.057
with anyone
from Hayley's inner circle.

22:23.158 --> 22:24.758
What about him
being in Philadelphia?

22:25.225 --> 22:27.160
With the right connections,
you can kill with a phone call.

22:27.161 --> 22:28.461
Yeah, right here.

22:28.727 --> 22:31.229
Looks like the day before
Hayley died, McGinnis put in

22:31.297 --> 22:34.398
a 10-minute phone call to Zack,
the guitarist.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.302
He hasn't represented
the band in months.

22:37.569 --> 22:39.938
Why would he call Zack
the day before Hayley died?

22:41.006 --> 22:42.207
Let's go find out.

22:44.775 --> 22:46.143
(Zack) What is your problem,
you freak?!

22:46.411 --> 22:47.846
You are completely mental!

22:47.847 --> 22:49.547
(Sky) Who the hell
do you think you are, loser?!

22:49.614 --> 22:51.716
Don't you walk away from me.
I'm talking to you!

22:51.783 --> 22:54.586
(objects clattering and crashing)
Get the hell away from me!
You touch me again,

22:54.587 --> 22:56.587
- and I swear to God, I will kill you!
- (Beckett) Hey! Hey!

22:56.590 --> 22:59.391
Screw you, you stupid whore!
Sit down, Zack!

22:59.458 --> 23:01.459
(Sky) Oh, stop!
Hey, Sky. It's okay. Sky.

23:01.527 --> 23:03.295
- No, don't! Leave me alone.
- What did you do to her?

23:03.363 --> 23:05.563
Nothing, man! She attacked me.

23:05.931 --> 23:07.632
We were riffing
on one of Hayley's songs.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.602
One minute she's singing along,
the next minute,

23:09.669 --> 23:11.938
She goes postal, starts telling
me I'm stealing from Hayley.

23:12.205 --> 23:14.040
- She's crazy.
- It doesn't look good, Zack.

23:14.708 --> 23:17.143
- Beating up one Blue, killing another?
- Look, I already told you gu--

23:17.211 --> 23:18.845
Sit down! Sit!

23:21.413 --> 23:22.213
Now talk.

23:24.081 --> 23:26.351
I already told you guys,
I didn't kill Hayley.

23:27.219 --> 23:28.720
Okay? I was at the birthday gig,
remember?

23:28.787 --> 23:30.522
Right.
The Gillespies' Sweet 16?

23:30.990 --> 23:34.491
You took three half-hour breaks
in between sets,

23:34.559 --> 23:36.928
<i>During which no one
remembers seeing you.</i>

23:37.196 --> 23:39.697
You could've easily
slipped away and killed Hayley.

23:39.765 --> 23:42.267
Nobody saw me because I didn't
want to spark up a pipe

23:42.334 --> 23:43.570
in front of a bunch of teenagers.

23:43.571 --> 23:45.871
Well, your innate sense of decency
is inspiring.

23:45.938 --> 23:47.205
Why did you talk
to John McGinnis

23:47.273 --> 23:48.375
the day before Hayley was killed?

23:48.376 --> 23:50.276
He's my manager.
Is that a crime?

23:50.342 --> 23:52.077
Ex-manager.
He let all of you guys go

23:52.144 --> 23:53.545
after Hayley disbanded the group.

23:54.913 --> 23:56.648
So why did he call you, Zack?

23:56.915 --> 23:59.950
I'll tell you why. You both
needed to get rid of Hayley

24:00.018 --> 24:02.121
to get the band name back,
and he called with a plan.

24:02.788 --> 24:05.223
Okay, look, fine, he had a plan.

24:05.290 --> 24:07.759
But it wasn't to kill Hayley.
He wanted to find Sky.

24:07.826 --> 24:09.528
- Why?
- He heard that Sky and Hayley

24:09.530 --> 24:12.030
were talking again. He wanted me
to grease her wheels a bit.

24:12.095 --> 24:13.998
Oh, what, with your
vast array of charms?

24:16.067 --> 24:17.802
McGinnis wanted me
to give her dope

24:18.469 --> 24:19.704
and have her talk to Hayley

24:20.171 --> 24:21.739
and get the band name back.

24:22.007 --> 24:25.009
He knew that the only way to get
to Hayley was through Sky.

24:25.577 --> 24:27.712
So I got her wasted, okay?

24:27.779 --> 24:29.280
A little too wasted.

24:29.548 --> 24:31.416
And I went
to go see Hayley myself.

24:32.984 --> 24:35.420
You saw Hayley the night
that she was killed?

24:36.088 --> 24:37.890
You shoulda told us that, Zack.

24:38.257 --> 24:41.260
What, make me look
even more guilty to you guys?

24:41.327 --> 24:44.696
No. I watch TV.
I know how the jury works.

24:44.763 --> 24:46.698
These are the little things
that get you convicted.

24:46.700 --> 24:47.900
So does lying to cops.

24:48.066 --> 24:49.701
Keep going. Spill it.

24:50.869 --> 24:51.970
She was at a coffeehouse.

24:53.438 --> 24:54.806
She was writing songs again.

24:55.073 --> 24:57.274
E-everything was fine
until her phone rang.

24:57.342 --> 24:58.310
What happened?

24:59.377 --> 25:00.378
She freaked.

25:00.546 --> 25:01.579
She hit "ignore,"

25:01.747 --> 25:03.948
but every time she did,
it just rang again.

25:04.016 --> 25:06.386
And every time it rang,
she just flipped out even more.

25:06.787 --> 25:08.087
You have any idea who it was?

25:08.853 --> 25:10.454
Yeah, because they called
so many times,

25:10.522 --> 25:11.657
I saw the caller ID

25:13.725 --> 25:14.727
It scared me when I saw it, too.

25:17.495 --> 25:19.132
It said it was Death calling.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.034
(Castle) I thought
she didn't have a phone?

25:24.402 --> 25:27.237
She probably had
a pay-as-you-go plan, paid cash,

25:27.305 --> 25:29.373
and gave the phone company
false information.

25:29.441 --> 25:31.375
Well, that makes sense
if she was hiding from Death

25:31.443 --> 25:33.244
and trying to stay off the grid
like Sky said.

25:33.612 --> 25:35.779
Okay, so obviously,
there's a human being

25:35.847 --> 25:36.481
at the other end of the phone.

25:36.549 --> 25:38.883
And whoever it is
probably tracked her down

25:38.951 --> 25:39.652
and then killed her.

25:39.719 --> 25:42.087
So who had
the dubious distinction

25:42.155 --> 25:43.922
of being known by Hayley
as "Death"?

25:44.190 --> 25:45.991
Okay. Well, how does the song go?

25:46.059 --> 25:49.093
"Death, she grows near."
"she"...Death is a woman.

25:49.161 --> 25:50.028
Okay, following you so far.

25:50.096 --> 25:52.063
Okay, Alexis says that Hayley

25:52.131 --> 25:54.166
liked to draw from
Tarot cards in her writing.

25:54.233 --> 25:56.168
And in Tarot cards,
Death isn't Death.

25:56.235 --> 25:57.203
Death means change.

25:57.204 --> 25:59.104
Okay, so she wasn't
hiding from Death.

25:59.271 --> 26:01.939
- She was hiding from change.
- She hated Obama.

26:02.007 --> 26:03.875
Who was the embodiment of change?

26:03.942 --> 26:06.910
What woman represented
the biggest change in Hayley's life?

26:09.481 --> 26:10.715
The one who sent her to rehab.

26:11.083 --> 26:12.717
The one who saved her life.

26:12.784 --> 26:15.219
Bree Busch? Why would Hayley's
producer want to hurt her?

26:15.287 --> 26:16.689
I don't know, but it's worth a shot.

26:17.656 --> 26:19.058
(sniffling)

26:21.226 --> 26:22.961
Are you crying?
(mouths words)

26:23.029 --> 26:26.297
(crying and sniffling)

26:29.300 --> 26:30.235
Hey.

26:33.104 --> 26:34.872
I was singing her words.

26:36.140 --> 26:37.209
I could hear her voice.

26:38.976 --> 26:40.945
I could feel her, like she was here.

26:45.216 --> 26:47.518
That's because your sister
was strong.

26:47.586 --> 26:48.620
(sniffling)

26:49.187 --> 26:50.622
You thought that
she was using again.

26:50.689 --> 26:52.624
But she wasn't.
She was clean.

27:01.166 --> 27:02.567
I wish there was something
we could do.

27:02.634 --> 27:04.035
Can't we send her to rehab
or something?

27:04.103 --> 27:07.038
No one can help her until
she's ready to get clean.

27:07.606 --> 27:10.541
So I called in the warrants
you wanted on Bree Busch.

27:10.609 --> 27:12.144
Phone records are gonna take a day,

27:12.212 --> 27:14.746
But her credit card puts her
in the city at 10:48.

27:15.214 --> 27:16.815
Now I checked our interview notes.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.784
She said she was at home
in Brooklyn at 10:00.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.385
Where was she at 10:48?

27:20.452 --> 27:22.353
At a pharmacy at 12th and 19th.

27:22.521 --> 27:24.456
That's three blocks
from the crime scene.

27:24.457 --> 27:25.057
(Esposito)
Yeah.

27:25.124 --> 27:26.258
Made me wonder
what she was shopping for,

27:26.326 --> 27:28.894
So I called the store.
They faxed over a receipt.

27:30.162 --> 27:31.996
Bottle of water, energy bar...

27:33.164 --> 27:36.967
and a tube of Daniella Bolan
Velvet Kiss Lava Red lipstick.

27:37.035 --> 27:40.872
That's the same lipstick used to
paint a smile on Hayley's face.

27:43.810 --> 27:47.345
Okay. It's true. I saw her
the night she died.

27:47.412 --> 27:48.781
Why didn't you
tell us that before?

27:49.548 --> 27:51.249
She had called the studio
earlier that day.

27:51.317 --> 27:52.984
She spoke to
my assistant Kelly, okay?

27:53.052 --> 27:54.720
She said she wanted to come by
and pick up some stuff

27:54.788 --> 27:56.989
She'd left behind--
a guitar and some pedals.

27:56.990 --> 27:58.090
That's how you got
her new number.

27:58.257 --> 28:00.326
I called her back immediately.
You know, I kept calling.

28:00.394 --> 28:02.929
She wouldn't pick up. I must
have left half a dozen messages.

28:03.096 --> 28:05.497
So finally I-I, you know,
left her a message saying,

28:05.565 --> 28:06.799
"come by tonight, you know.

28:06.866 --> 28:08.101
Someone will be here
to give you your stuff."

28:08.168 --> 28:10.304
And I didn't tell her it was
gonna be me, so she showed.

28:10.305 --> 28:11.105
What time was that?

28:11.272 --> 28:12.439
Oh, about 11:00.

28:14.206 --> 28:16.074
Anyway, I-I said, "I'm not
gonna give you your stuff

28:16.142 --> 28:17.910
unless you tell me
what's going on," you know?

28:17.978 --> 28:21.780
She wouldn't even look at me.
You have to understand, um,

28:22.548 --> 28:24.450
I had put so much money
into this record,

28:24.517 --> 28:27.053
If she didn't finish it,
I was gonna lose the studio.

28:29.621 --> 28:31.589
So I had to get her
to stay, right?

28:31.757 --> 28:35.459
Mm. Uh, she was using anyway.

28:36.627 --> 28:37.829
You offered her drugs.

28:38.896 --> 28:40.431
A bag. I offered her a bag.

28:40.498 --> 28:42.501
I said, "there's plenty more
where that came from."

28:44.368 --> 28:45.303
Well, I-I would've, uh...

28:45.971 --> 28:48.105
Gotten her help
after she finished.

28:48.173 --> 28:50.307
I couldn't
let her walk away.

28:50.375 --> 28:51.910
Yeah. Well, here's the thing,
Mrs. Busch...

28:52.478 --> 28:55.680
Hayley was clean when she died.
She wasn't using.

28:55.748 --> 28:56.949
Well, I know that now.

28:58.017 --> 29:00.451
I mean, she...
she opened up her jacket

29:00.519 --> 29:03.055
and showed me what was
tucked inside...a gun.

29:04.623 --> 29:05.824
I mean, she had a gun.

29:06.791 --> 29:08.994
And she said, "I would rather
put a bullet in my brain

29:09.061 --> 29:10.530
than to be using again."

29:10.731 --> 29:12.131
Let me make sure
I'm getting this right.

29:13.197 --> 29:15.599
You lured Hayley here
under false pretenses,

29:15.667 --> 29:18.436
Offered her drugs,
got into a heated argument,

29:18.503 --> 29:21.539
and you're telling me that she
walked out of that door alive?

29:23.007 --> 29:24.876
When did you replace
the panel on this baffle?

29:26.244 --> 29:28.145
I-I don't think
it's ever been replaced.

29:28.313 --> 29:30.315
Yeah, it has. It's newer
than the other ones.

29:30.316 --> 29:31.016
Could you be careful, please?

29:31.083 --> 29:32.950
That's expensive equipment.
(wood thuds)

29:33.518 --> 29:34.819
Castle, what are you doing?

29:40.892 --> 29:42.560
Apparently, I'm uncovering
a bullet hole.

29:48.033 --> 29:50.668
Judging from the diameter
of the hole, it's a .38.

29:50.736 --> 29:52.670
That gunpowder residue
on Hayley's hands?

29:53.338 --> 29:53.672
This is where
the gun was fired.

29:56.940 --> 29:59.310
I have no idea
how that bullet hole got there.

29:59.311 --> 30:00.311
You and Haley fought.

30:00.378 --> 30:02.412
You knew that if
she walked out that door,

30:02.480 --> 30:03.547
you would never see her again.

30:03.615 --> 30:05.183
So you grabbed her from behind.

30:05.850 --> 30:08.452
She pulled out a gun.
It scared you.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.420
You held her tight.
A shot went off.

30:10.488 --> 30:11.622
You held her tighter still,

30:11.690 --> 30:13.057
and before you even knew
what happened,

30:13.125 --> 30:14.426
she stopped struggling.

30:15.494 --> 30:17.296
You broke her neck
without realizing it.

30:17.297 --> 30:18.697
That's not what happened.

30:18.964 --> 30:20.699
That's not what happened at all.

30:20.966 --> 30:23.735
If it was an accident, if it was
an act of self-defense,

30:23.803 --> 30:26.037
You're gonna make this
all easier on yourself

30:26.105 --> 30:27.906
<i>Just by telling us the truth.</i>

30:28.973 --> 30:30.108
(Montgomery)
She's gonna do 20 years

30:30.175 --> 30:31.676
instead of pleading out
and doing five.

30:31.944 --> 30:34.178
Guilty conscience or lousy lawyer?

30:34.346 --> 30:37.482
<i>Bree, please. I can't
lose you for 20 years.</i>

30:37.550 --> 30:40.051
<i>I can't lie.
I didn't hurt her!</i>

30:41.118 --> 30:41.853
<i>That's not what happened.</i>

30:41.854 --> 30:42.654
I guess it's up to
the lawyers now.

30:42.721 --> 30:44.422
<i>That's not what hap...</i>

31:00.471 --> 31:02.172
You goin' home
to tell Alexis the news?

31:02.240 --> 31:03.474
Just thought I'd go for a walk.

31:03.642 --> 31:04.910
Anyplace in particular?

31:08.379 --> 31:10.280
It kills me thinking about her
out there alone.

31:13.251 --> 31:14.686
Come on. I'll drive.

31:19.289 --> 31:20.090
Sky?

31:20.658 --> 31:21.559
Sky?

31:22.727 --> 31:24.596
Are you sure Zack said
she was crashing here?

31:24.663 --> 31:26.030
Yeah.

31:32.303 --> 31:33.038
(clattering)

31:34.405 --> 31:35.339
It's over there.

31:37.207 --> 31:38.377
(Beckett) Sky. Sky.

31:41.545 --> 31:42.147
Hey.

31:43.514 --> 31:44.581
You okay?

31:44.749 --> 31:45.684
Can you hear me?

31:47.051 --> 31:48.186
How much did you take?

31:48.854 --> 31:50.355
McGinnis gave us a signing bonus.

31:51.123 --> 31:52.791
He told us a place
we could fix for cheap.

31:56.027 --> 31:58.762
Mm. I couldn't do it.
(sighs)

31:58.830 --> 32:00.331
No, Hayley didn't want me to.

32:04.035 --> 32:06.471
I c--I'm clean.

32:08.939 --> 32:10.874
She's gonna help me, right?

32:11.842 --> 32:13.045
Wherever she is...

32:14.712 --> 32:16.114
She's looking out for me, right?

32:17.681 --> 32:19.016
She's already doing it.

I think so

32:41.839 --> 32:42.973
The worst part is over.

32:43.041 --> 32:46.077
Now she just has to figure out
the rest of her life.

32:47.245 --> 32:48.380
And Hayley?

32:48.547 --> 32:50.782
The whole thing was just
some stupid accident?

32:52.550 --> 32:53.952
It's just so pointless.

32:54.619 --> 32:56.187
I know.

32:56.254 --> 32:58.322
Sometimes when we lose
an artist we like,

32:58.390 --> 32:59.491
It's kinda like losing a friend.

33:00.559 --> 33:02.960
You know, I remember
when John Lennon died...

33:03.628 --> 33:05.329
I didn't leave my room for a week.

33:05.997 --> 33:07.498
She was only 25.

33:08.066 --> 33:10.501
I can't help but think about
all the songs she won't write

33:10.569 --> 33:12.303
That we won't get to hear now.

33:13.171 --> 33:16.273
And all because a producer
thought she was back on drugs...

33:17.141 --> 33:18.375
Why would she even think that?

33:18.743 --> 33:21.177
You know, when people
we care about

33:21.245 --> 33:22.379
suddenly turn against us,

33:22.447 --> 33:25.283
we can come up with all sorts
of reasons to explain it.

33:57.314 --> 33:58.449

34:00.116 --> 34:02.652
She wrote that song
a week before she died,

34:02.720 --> 34:04.955
after she left her producers
and went to the cops.

34:05.023 --> 34:08.159
Maybe she's trying to tell us
what was going on.

34:09.226 --> 34:11.862
"locked up in silence,
a living hell."

34:12.429 --> 34:13.730
Rehab?

34:14.098 --> 34:15.699

what I think it means?

34:53.873 --> 34:54.806
(cell phone beeps)

34:56.974 --> 35:00.210
It means...
We have the wrong killer.

35:03.803 --> 35:05.671
(Beckett) The identity of
our killer is in the song?

35:05.739 --> 35:08.273
- It's right there. Listen.
- I know. I already heard it.

35:08.341 --> 35:10.076
Don't you think that if Hayley
knew who was gonna kill her,

35:10.144 --> 35:11.380
She would've tried
to prevent the murder?

35:11.381 --> 35:13.781
It never made sense until now.
Why would she up and disappear

35:13.848 --> 35:15.149
when everything seemed to be
going so well?

35:16.217 --> 35:17.084
It's in the words.
She even says it.

35:17.152 --> 35:19.254
"I can explain
if you're listening."

35:36.736 --> 35:38.337
Just like that,
I'm free to go?

35:38.805 --> 35:39.839
Just like that.
(laughs)

35:39.907 --> 35:41.141
You need to sign
a few release forms,

35:41.209 --> 35:42.077
If you don't mind.

35:42.078 --> 35:43.378
(Ian) I don't believe it.
Thank God.

35:44.045 --> 35:45.046
Thank you so much.

35:45.314 --> 35:46.949
Does this mean
you found the real killer?

35:48.350 --> 35:49.550
(Beckett) We're about
to make an arrest.

35:50.717 --> 35:51.885
That's great.

35:52.286 --> 35:53.186
You know what's even better

35:53.253 --> 35:55.622
is it was Hayley herself
who led us to her killer.

35:56.690 --> 35:57.490
How'd she do that?

35:58.158 --> 36:00.726
Her last song...the one that was
playing the night she died.

36:00.794 --> 36:02.429

Mm-hmm. First time I heard it,

36:16.577 --> 36:18.245
I thought it was about
going into rehab.

36:18.313 --> 36:21.814
It is. It's about
coming from a dark place

36:21.982 --> 36:24.350
And having the courage
to get on with your life.

36:24.717 --> 36:26.252
Different dark place. Listen.

analyze them, it's all there...

36:57.384 --> 36:59.452
Father figure, betrayal...

37:00.320 --> 37:01.354
Violation.

37:02.222 --> 37:03.790
It's truly awful.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.726
Why didn't she say anything?

37:08.594 --> 37:10.262
Ian, did she ever
say anything to you?

37:10.330 --> 37:11.597
No, she didn't.

37:11.665 --> 37:13.666
You told your husband about
arguing with Hayley

37:13.733 --> 37:16.268
The night she was killed, didn't you?
(Bree) Yes.

37:16.536 --> 37:18.904
He was there when I got home
from the studio.

37:19.072 --> 37:20.140
I told him the whole thing.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.642
Uh, I was so upset,

37:23.710 --> 37:25.113
I took a sleeping pill
to get some rest.

37:25.314 --> 37:27.114
That's when you borrowed
your wife's cell phone

37:28.080 --> 37:29.381
and her brand-new lipstick.

37:29.649 --> 37:30.750
It's a good thing we'd subpoenaed

37:30.818 --> 37:31.418
your wife's phone records

37:31.486 --> 37:33.753
when I had
this whole crazy lyric idea.

37:34.021 --> 37:35.255
Otherwise,
we might have missed out

37:35.323 --> 37:36.525
on those texts you sent Hayley.

37:36.726 --> 37:37.726
What texts?

37:39.893 --> 37:42.428
Text message from your phone
at 11:52...

37:43.095 --> 37:45.631
"Ian told me the whole thing.
We have to talk right away.

37:45.798 --> 37:47.099
Meet me at the studio."

37:47.167 --> 37:48.267
I never sent that text.

37:48.335 --> 37:51.203
11:54..."I'm so sorry
for what he did to you.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.838
I'm leaving him.
Please come talk to me."

37:53.306 --> 37:56.476
And then finally at 11:56,
a reply from Hayley.

37:57.043 --> 37:58.378
"see you there."

37:59.345 --> 38:00.546
(voice breaks)
What did you do?

38:00.914 --> 38:03.416
"the loving hand that saved me
held too tight."

38:04.283 --> 38:05.352
He pretended to be you

38:06.719 --> 38:09.355
because he was the one
who forced himself on Hayley.

38:09.923 --> 38:11.457
He was afraid she was gonna talk,

38:12.225 --> 38:13.192
So he pretended.

38:13.860 --> 38:15.360
By the time Hayley realized

38:15.428 --> 38:17.362
it was Ian waiting for her
at the office,

38:17.430 --> 38:18.164
it was too late.

38:19.032 --> 38:20.199
Ian?

38:24.771 --> 38:25.704
(shouting)
Ian?!

38:25.772 --> 38:27.440
I didn't force myself on Hayley.

38:28.007 --> 38:31.242
She seduced me,
from the time she moved in...

38:31.410 --> 38:33.912
The way she talked to me,
the way she touched me.

38:33.980 --> 38:36.081
And now after all we'd done for her,

38:36.149 --> 38:38.817
she was gonna make up this lie
to destroy our marriage

38:38.885 --> 38:40.553
and ruin our...our business?

38:41.320 --> 38:43.689
- No.
- So you snapped her neck.

38:44.557 --> 38:46.358
The gun didn't do her
any good, did it?

38:47.126 --> 38:48.160
You were too strong,

38:48.428 --> 38:50.163
Just like the night
when you assaulted her.

38:51.731 --> 38:53.099
You killed her.

38:53.767 --> 38:55.568
And you almost got away with it.

38:55.735 --> 38:58.971
But Hayley wouldn't shut up,
would she?

38:59.039 --> 38:59.873
That was pretty smart,

38:59.940 --> 39:01.908
staging the crime scene
like the stalker video,

39:01.976 --> 39:03.710
making it look like
someone else did it.

39:04.678 --> 39:06.346
She loved you like a father.

39:07.814 --> 39:08.883
The way she looked up to you...

39:11.151 --> 39:12.785
It made me love you more.

39:13.953 --> 39:15.220
(cries)

39:15.288 --> 39:16.522
Look at me.

39:17.390 --> 39:18.792
I'd like a lawyer now.

39:25.231 --> 39:26.632
Bree turned on her husband

39:26.700 --> 39:28.935
the moment she found out
what he had done to Hayley.

39:29.203 --> 39:31.137
Needless to say,
she's filed for divorce.

39:31.405 --> 39:33.940
No wonder Hayley couldn't
tell Bree why she ran away.

39:34.008 --> 39:36.075
You see, she didn't have
anyone to talk to.

39:36.143 --> 39:39.079
So she did the one thing that
she could. She wrote about it.

39:39.180 --> 39:40.080
That kinda reminds me

39:40.146 --> 39:41.914
of when I wrote
"When it Comes to Slaughter."

39:42.482 --> 39:43.984
It was at a time in my life
when I was just...

39:44.052 --> 39:48.287
I was trying to work through...
It's not important.

39:48.755 --> 39:50.590
- So is he pleading out?
- Oh, he can try.

39:51.057 --> 39:52.625
Perlmutter ran his coat and found

39:52.693 --> 39:54.527
the same gunpowder residue
that he found on Hayley.

39:54.595 --> 39:57.063
- He's going away for a long time.
- Good.

39:58.331 --> 39:59.599
Nice job...

40:00.366 --> 40:01.701
Both of you.

40:07.206 --> 40:08.641
So what are you gonna tell Alexis?

40:09.909 --> 40:11.144
What I always tell her...

40:12.411 --> 40:13.812
The truth.

40:13.980 --> 40:19.116
(rock music playing)

40:19.184 --> 40:21.853
(cheers and applause)

40:21.921 --> 40:23.555
Hayley Maria Blue,

40:23.823 --> 40:24.757
