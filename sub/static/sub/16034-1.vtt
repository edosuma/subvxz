WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.979
(Gulls cry)

00:33.080 --> 00:35.139
Mr Poldark...

00:35.320 --> 00:38.585
it is alleged
that you roused the neighbourhood...

00:39.040 --> 00:41.543
and led a bloodthirsty mob
down to the beach.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.984
- Incorrect.
- Which part?

00:44.160 --> 00:47.027
They Were not thirsty for blood.
They were starving for food.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.828
Did you encourage the riot
Which broke out on the beach?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.262
I did not consider it a riot.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.305
Do you approve of plunder
and lawlessness?

00:53.480 --> 00:56.620
Do you approve of families being
Without sufficient food to keep them alive?

00:56.800 --> 00:59.780
What part did you play
in the death of MattheW Sanson?

00:59.960 --> 01:01.302
Regrettably, none Whatsoever.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.823
(Sighs) Enough of this insolence.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.746
Ross Vennor Poldark,

01:06.920 --> 01:09.787
I am committing you for trial
at the Bodmin assizes.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.064
Bail Will be set at 1 00.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.984
And may God have mercy upon you,
for I, most assuredly, Would not.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.739
(Wind Whistles)

02:50.840 --> 02:52.819
Julia...

02:56.920 --> 02:58.945
(Door opens)

02:59.120 --> 03:01.099
Ross!

03:02.640 --> 03:04.824
They let you go. I kneW they Would.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.379
Did they dismiss all the charges?

03:09.240 --> 03:11.219
Not quite.

03:11.800 --> 03:15.827
I'm to be tried by Justice Lister
at the Bodmin assizes in five days' time.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.107
I must present myself at the gaol
the night before.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.229
Oh, God... how has it come to this?

03:25.640 --> 03:27.619
George?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.939
This entire thing is a nonsense.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.266
I'll be back before you know I've gone.

03:40.400 --> 03:44.302
he should never have been charged.
He's a gentleman, and a Poldark.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.981
his own worst enemy.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.105
I would speak to him, but he avoids me.

03:48.280 --> 03:52.387
he avoids us all. Since they lost Julia.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.786
Well, something must be done
or he will walk his head into a noose.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.020
Or that new contraption they have in France.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.909
If he's a sensible man, he will...
seek assistance.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.545
have words in the ears of those that matter.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.188
- The Boscowans?
- St Aubyns.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.185
- Warleggans?
- (Scoffss)

04:18.360 --> 04:20.260
When their cousin died in the wreck? No.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.989
George is...
very likely behind the accusations.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.628
But he could exert influence if he chose.

04:26.800 --> 04:31.100
Mm. his reach...extends everywhere.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.389
Why would George
throw his might behind Ross?

04:36.560 --> 04:38.699
You're right. Why would he?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.659
(Gulls cry)

04:48.960 --> 04:52.100
- There's a storm coming.
- (Thunder rumbles)

04:52.280 --> 04:54.259
Julia's afeared of thunder.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.704
I keep thinking that she's still here.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.899
And if I just call her name...

05:07.800 --> 05:09.779
I'll be better, by and by.

05:11.440 --> 05:16.309
I tell myself that every day. And every day I fail.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.146
We must think of the trial.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.744
- (Groans) Must we?
- Ross, 'tis no little thing.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.502
It's a proper trial, not just a magistrate.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.308
You must answer to judge and jury,
and if you're found guilty...

05:32.480 --> 05:35.347
They cannot hang me.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.465
- I've too much to do.
- Truly, Ross...

05:37.640 --> 05:41.861
Truly, Demelza, I decline to be distracted
by matters beyond my control.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.347
Give me_ leave to _attend
on something I can Influence.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.739
(Low chatter)

05:52.360 --> 05:56.706
Gentlemen! I leave for Bodmin in two days.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.268
What are we waiting for?

05:58.440 --> 06:00.749
No doubt ye aim to strike
a new lode before 'ee go.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.229
A couple at least, so let's get down there.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.709
New lode? he'll be luclq.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.745
The old Trebartha lode's near petered out,

06:07.920 --> 06:10.423
- but he won't have it.
- No more than he'll have this trial.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.068
To hear him you'd think
he was heading for Michaelmas Fair.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.665
Dwight.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.705
he cannot just bury his head.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.906
Then will you tell him? It's almost upon him.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.344
how will he defend himself?
Who will speak for him?

06:24.520 --> 06:27.148
I will. But there must be others,
and plenty of them.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.504
_ The Crown _
WIII already have assembled Its case.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.581
And no doubt there'll be plenty
who'll be glad to help it.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.658
- Can I rely on you, Tankard?
- Of course.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.339
Always happy to be of service.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.587
Why is our attorney here?

06:47.760 --> 06:50.581
he's been assisting the Crown
to strengthen its case.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.025
Mm. Theft, riot,
attacking a customs officer.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.701
- Is that not enough?
- I wanted murder.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.098
I told you that charge would not stick.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.947
Cousin Matthew was dead
before he washed ashore.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.941
- Poldark merely found him.
- And left him lifeless on the strand.

07:06.120 --> 07:09.260
_ _ - Which is not a crime. _ _
- But It IS a personal affront to this family.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.379
And one which I intend to make him regret.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.909
Prudence Paynter! My name's Tankard.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.379
Acting for the Crown
in the case of Rex versus Poldark.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.225
What do you recall the night of the shipwreck?

07:41.720 --> 07:44.268
- Shipwreck?
- See thee now, woman.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.182
When there's riot and robbery
like there was on that night...

07:47.360 --> 07:51.148
The law says naught of those who follow
if it can lay hold of those who lead.

07:51.320 --> 07:56.622
So, 'tis best for all concerned
that the right man should stand in the assizes.

07:56.800 --> 08:00.258
The right man? Ross Poldark?

08:03.680 --> 08:05.659
I never see'd sight nor sound of him.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.623
Elizabeth. Are you alone?

08:49.800 --> 08:51.540
I was about to return to Trenwith.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.019
Would you consider a small delay?

09:02.480 --> 09:04.459
(Chatter)

09:05.480 --> 09:09.462
GEORGE: Are you suggesting I intervene?
- The family would be so grateful.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.225
The family means little to me.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.301
You alone are the person I care to please.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.624
It distresses me to think
of my cousin at risk of his life.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.468
It is I who would be indebted to you, George.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.660
how difficult would it be to have him
come before a sympathetic judge?

09:35.760 --> 09:39.901
There are ways of encouraging such sympathy.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.227
But does Ross ask it of me?

09:42.400 --> 09:45.142
You know, you and Ross
are more alike than you know.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.424
I have said so. I said it to him.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.149
I do not think he could fail to feel gratitude.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.265
If he felt himself beholden,

09:53.440 --> 09:56.625
if...if he could see his benefactor
in a new light.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.819
So, you've made no arrangements?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.060
- None whatsoever.
- Jeffrey Clymer, KC.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.185
Your defence. he'll meet you in Bodmin.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.907
Will he?

10:17.080 --> 10:19.548
Next, your finances.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.499
You are chief shareholder in Wheal Leisure.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.262
Other than that, you have no income.

10:27.280 --> 10:31.228
Your tenants regularly default on their rents,
your house is mortgaged

10:31.400 --> 10:36.303
and you have outstanding debts
of 1 ,000 at interest of 40% .

10:37.760 --> 10:39.466
My wife will be sorry she wed me.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.541
Your wife deserves better.
Have you made a Will?

10:42.720 --> 10:44.620
Course not.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.588
- I need a list of all your assets.
- That shouldn't take long.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.579
ELIZABETH: My dear Demelza.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.349
I know that recent events
have caused a breach between our two families,

11:06.520 --> 11:09.785
but wonder if I could persuade
you and Ross to visit us

11:09.960 --> 11:12.781
at Trenwith tomorrow afternoon?

11:12.960 --> 11:15.064
(Geese honking, traders calling out)

11:21.960 --> 11:24.064
- Ah, Captain Poldark!
- Mr Trevaunance.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.105
How goes your campaign?

11:26.280 --> 11:27.588
Better than yours, I imagine.

11:27.760 --> 11:31.389
- Who was that?
- No-one of any influence.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.859
Jud Paynter?

11:49.320 --> 11:50.389
Never heard of him.

11:50.560 --> 11:53.108
You were on Hendrawna Beach
the night of the shipwreck.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.624
- this will jog your memory.
- Ah, well, now...

11:58.800 --> 12:01.860
Get off home,
you bladderwrackin', pifflin' piece of offal!

12:15.560 --> 12:18.142
- Uncle Ray.
- Caroline!

12:19.000 --> 12:23.699
My dear! And Mr Trevaunance,
our prospective member of Parliament.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.781
I see you travel light, niece.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.261
How long are you intending to stay?

12:30.440 --> 12:34.422
That depends. If my little Horace and I get bored
we may be forced to return to London.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.864
No doubt you're much in demand there.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.385
An heiress is much in demand everywhere,
especially one who's not yet of age.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.629
Why so?

12:41.800 --> 12:46.578
It's assumed she'll do the bidding of her
wealthy uncle and marry where he chooses.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.500
(Chuckles) You confident, Unwin?

12:48.680 --> 12:50.068
Winning his seat or my hand?

12:50.240 --> 12:51.741
Both, I trust.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.621
I hope we can come to terms soon, sir.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.665
I hope so, too.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.900
She runs rings round her old guardian.

13:00.680 --> 13:04.343
I'm sure a younger man
would benefit from the exercise.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.549
Did I mention I saw Unwin Trevaunance,
our would-be MP,

13:08.720 --> 13:12.178
and his intended, Ray Penvenen's niece?

13:12.640 --> 13:14.904
No doubt she's in town
for the election in Bodmin.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.827
Never been to Bodmin.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.865
Be grateful you're not going now.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.905
Why?

13:22.080 --> 13:24.867
The elections take place
the same day as the assizes.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.019
The town will be seething.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.419
Will Elizabeth go?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.459
I shouldn't think so.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.859
She sent us a note.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.105
What could she want?

13:45.280 --> 13:47.259
The same as I.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.505
You did promise me after Julia died
that we would all be reconciled.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.099
You still want that?

14:00.320 --> 14:02.299
With the trial nigh upon us...

14:04.240 --> 14:06.105
..maybe I'll be glad of the friendship.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.259
Even though the cost is Julia?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.704
Nay, Ross, you cannot lay it all at their door.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.745
Why can I not?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.423
'Tis why I do wish to make peace...

14:16.760 --> 14:18.739
..despite all that we lost.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.468
Will it not mean that Julia didn't die in vain?

14:47.480 --> 14:49.459
It's good of you both to come.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.102
- Is Francis here?
- Somewhere hereabouts.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.259
I wanted to speak with you first.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.026
To ask if some help might be given
when you come to court.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.829
I hope you will take the gesture
with the kindness in which it's intended.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.139
(Footsteps)

15:19.320 --> 15:21.299
"Gesture"?

15:24.880 --> 15:27.860
George might know the judge
who will hear your case.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.143
How convenient.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.743
And thought that perhaps he could be...

15:33.480 --> 15:35.619
Pointed in the right direction.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.620
For a price, no doubt.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.827
Not one that you would personally need to pay.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.905
But I see that I would.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.786
(Door opens)

15:49.960 --> 15:52.508
And it strikes me
as more than my liberty's worth.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.580
- (Door closes)
- Demelza, we're leaving.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.059
Ross...

16:01.320 --> 16:03.788
Elizabeth, what's the meaning of this?

16:03.960 --> 16:06.702
I...I thought if there was something
we could do to help Ross...

16:06.880 --> 16:09.064
_ "We"?
- We appreciate the thought.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.707
But not the method.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.699
Ross...

16:21.960 --> 16:23.905
You'll excuse us, George.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.019
O course.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.860
I thought it the least we could do.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.941
- For Demelza's sake.
- Demelza's?

16:42.320 --> 16:44.299
Of course.

16:56.680 --> 17:00.821
Do they seriously imagine
I would stoop to beg favours

17:01.000 --> 17:02.979
from that upstart poodle?

17:03.520 --> 17:06.899
IfI wished to prostitute myself,
I'd sooner grovel to Ray Penvenen

17:07.080 --> 17:09.344
who's actually acquainted
with Judge Lister.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.942
- Is he?
- It really is the end for me and Francis.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.825
- Where are you going?
- To the mine.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.060
Where it's still possible
to do an honest day's work.

17:23.360 --> 17:28.741
"A known Jacobin and revolutionary,
formentor of unrest and affray.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.741
Once escaped justice
by taking the King's shilling,

17:31.920 --> 17:36.220
fathered numerous bastards,
bedded and wedded his scullery maid

17:36.400 --> 17:40.621
upon whom he got his latest brat,
this creature being a notorious doxy

17:40.800 --> 17:43.542
from a family of murderers and thieves."

17:44.840 --> 17:47.502
Our friend "Anonymous"
has an engaging style.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.306
How many copies?

17:50.480 --> 17:52.664
Enough to paper all Truro and Bodmin.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.219
If he's found guilty, he could hang.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.424
If he hangs, he'll have only himselfto blame.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.019
Mistress Poldark to see Mister Penvenen.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.939
Mrs Poldark?

18:40.560 --> 18:42.141
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.503
Forgive the intrusion, sir.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.705
I was taken queasy as I was out walking and...

18:45.880 --> 18:47.825
well, yours was the first house I saw.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.501
Ah.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.187
(Grunting)

18:57.760 --> 18:59.978
'Tis no use, Ross.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.947
The lode has petered out.
We knew it a week ago.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.341
- So we give up?
- We move on.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.659
FRANCIS: There sits our old mine.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.983
Lost in a game of cards to a Warleggan.

19:57.840 --> 20:02.664
Ross would never gamble away
his...most precious asset, would he?

20:02.840 --> 20:04.819
He is too wise and clever.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.184
Francis, what is done is done.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.744
DEMELZA: Thank you forthe refreshment, sir.

20:23.920 --> 20:28.983
I hope that you are not too downcast
about your husband's coming trial.

20:29.160 --> 20:32.903
(Sighs) Truly...I fear the worst.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.185
If only one knew
who the judge would be.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.739
Oh, that's no secret, ma'am.
Tis Justice Wentworth Lister.

20:39.920 --> 20:42.741
Oh. Are you acquainted with him?

20:42.920 --> 20:45.627
Oh, we know each other.
He'll be supporting Unwin Trevaunance

20:45.800 --> 20:47.222
at the election tomorrow night.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.348
A stern fellow, though generally accounted fair.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.909
(Sighs) It do puzzle me exceedingly
how a judge can be expected to listen to a case

20:56.080 --> 20:59.504
and get to the bottom of it all in a few hours.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.461
Does he never ask for the truth in private
before the trial begins?

21:03.640 --> 21:05.619
(Chuckles) Perhaps he should!

21:10.120 --> 21:13.385
- Will you be in Bodmin for the assizes?
- For the election, yes.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.100
Well, I hope we may meet again, sir.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.545
- Who is that, Uncle?
- Hm? Ross Poldark's wife.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.507
- What does she want?
- She didn't appear to want anything.

21:36.680 --> 21:40.502
Well, I doubt that, sir.
She looks like a dangerous woman to me.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.468
Ross.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.146
Well, this is well met.
May I walk with you awhile?

21:57.320 --> 21:59.823
- I'm pressed for time.
- The encounter yesterday,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.865
that was not my doing.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.100
Still, I'd hoped we could put
past quarrels behind us.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.540
I had hoped so, too.
But I find now I cannot.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.585
Ross...

22:11.760 --> 22:14.979
if something goes amiss in court,
how is Demelza fixed?

22:19.200 --> 22:21.065
How is that your concern?

22:21.240 --> 22:25.267
If your sentence is prison...or worse, erm...

22:26.400 --> 22:29.062
..well, she would be entirely alone
with no source of income.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.061
Whereas you yourself
are swimming in guineas?

22:32.240 --> 22:33.980
No, no. I've erm...I've a little put by.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.821
Why would you offer it?

22:36.000 --> 22:39.106
I don't forget what we owe Demelza.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.149
(Knock on door)

22:51.320 --> 22:53.299
Mr Warleggan, ma'am.

22:55.640 --> 22:59.224
Elizabeth. You look ravishing today.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.379
- And you, too, of course, ma'am.
- I do not.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.700
And nor, may I say, do you.
Quite pasty-faced.

23:08.880 --> 23:12.464
Consequence of sitting
too long indoors fingering coin.

23:12.640 --> 23:16.064
(Clears throat)
I've brought a small gift for my godson.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.789
Oh. That's kind of you, George.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.825
Papa!

23:28.000 --> 23:29.979
Look, my very own horse.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.987
Uncle George bought it for me.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.139
Did he?

23:36.960 --> 23:38.825
(Door opens)

23:39.000 --> 23:43.664
George, here again.
I hope you're taking care of our guest, Elizabeth.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.259
(Glass clinks, drink poured)

23:48.280 --> 23:51.704
I saw my cousin just now.
He was not eager to exchange pleasantries.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.542
No doubt he's thinking ofthe trial.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.143
Do you think he'll be acquitted?

23:58.280 --> 23:59.907
I don't see how he can be.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.139
So many witnesses to his activities that night.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.981
(Scoffs)

24:04.160 --> 24:07.823
And the fact that he's treated the law
With contempt on preVIous occa5ions.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.979
And the court will not be left in ignorance.

24:10.160 --> 24:14.859
As I came past Sawle,
a villager showed me this pretty paper.

24:15.040 --> 24:18.862
"The true and sensational life of Captain R P.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.989
Adventurer, seducer, wrecker
and suspected murderer."

24:24.160 --> 24:26.549
Yes, I've seen them about.
They're not important.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.938
- Except to Ross.
- But ifthis is believed,

24:29.120 --> 24:31.463
- it will prejudice the jury.
- Pay no heed, Elizabeth.

24:31.640 --> 24:34.700
These scurrilous sheets are always defaming
one person or another.

24:34.880 --> 24:39.146
Yes, but this author has gone
to some trouble and expense.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.699
You wouldn't happen to know him...
would you, George?

24:45.120 --> 24:47.862
I imagine he must be desperate
to earn his money in such a manner.

24:48.040 --> 24:51.862
Only a bankrupt would sell his services that way.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.544
(Drunkenly) They had no tail nor bill

24:59.880 --> 25:04.180
They had no tail nor...bill

25:04.840 --> 25:06.819
Jud Paynter.

25:09.880 --> 25:13.464
'Tis said that you and your good wife
were once servants of Captain Poldark?

25:14.840 --> 25:16.228
And his father afore him.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.823
And that after serving faithfully
for all those years

25:19.000 --> 25:21.901
- you were turned out without a word.
- Monstry ingratitude!

25:22.080 --> 25:23.866
So you understand your duty under the law

25:24.040 --> 25:26.224
is to report what you saw
the night ofthe wreck?

25:26.800 --> 25:28.904
We know you took part
in the riot and pillaging.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.742
We know you played a part
in resisting officers ofthe Crown.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.228
I never 'eard such...

25:33.400 --> 25:37.700
But we're willing to overlook all that
if you will turn King's evidence.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.179
You owe him no loyalty.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.465
It's common sense to testify against him.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.659
We'll make it worth your while.

25:52.320 --> 25:56.586
I have no idea what to say in your defence
and you leave for Bodmin tomorrow.

25:56.760 --> 26:00.503
I was not on the beach,
so I cannot refute the charges

26:00.680 --> 26:03.865
but from what I hear,
they are not easily dismissed.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.826
Salvaging spoils from a wreck?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.979
No jury in Cornwall will convict me ofthat.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.344
- Attacking a customs official?
- Not guilty.

26:13.800 --> 26:14.903
You doubt me.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.059
We both know you're capable of it.

26:18.840 --> 26:24.540
- Your situation is not good, Ross.
- I've seen worse. We've seen worse.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.939
- On the battlefields of Virginia.
- And I salute you for saving my face.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.099
Saving your neck may not be so easy.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.823
I'll ask Demelza
not to come to Bodmin tomorrow.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.979
So you and I will ride together?

26:42.080 --> 26:44.947
Perhaps as we go
some brilliant defence will occur to me.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.543
(Horse galloping)

27:19.680 --> 27:21.659
(Music plays from inside)

27:38.160 --> 27:40.139
Who's this fine lady?

27:41.200 --> 27:43.623
- And what has she done with my wife?
-Judas!

27:43.800 --> 27:45.665
(Laughs) Well, there she is.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.705
For a moment, I thought I'd lost her.

27:47.880 --> 27:51.338
Why? Cos she's prinked up to the nines
and her fizzog's powdered?

27:51.520 --> 27:53.863
Clearly I needn't worry about you
when I'm gone.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.184
You'll have a line of suitors
from here to Penzance.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.180
So I should hope.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.819
(Knock at door)

28:56.400 --> 28:58.140
May I join you awhile?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.419
Perhaps another night.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.259
Good night, Francis.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.659
Good night.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.179
(Wood chopping continues outside)

29:56.120 --> 29:58.304
So you leave me a-bed
like the Queen of Sheba

29:58.480 --> 29:59.742
while you see to all the chores?

29:59.920 --> 30:02.627
Is it not my duty to cherish my wife
while I'm here?

30:02.800 --> 30:04.984
And to provide firewood for when I'm not?

30:13.280 --> 30:15.259
I wish we could stay like this forever.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.499
I wish so, too.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.708
I'm only glad for your sake
you're not seeing me in court.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.859
No, Ross.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.025
You will stay here?

30:32.200 --> 30:34.384
Yes, Ross, ifthat's what you wish.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.188
Elizabeth? I'm leaving for Bodmin.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.779
Shall I not come with you?

31:14.640 --> 31:17.188
A court is no place for a lady.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.109
It's a terrible thought, is it not?

31:26.520 --> 31:28.385
A world without Ross.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.187
I wonder how Demelza would bear it.

31:30.360 --> 31:32.180
How would any of us bear it?

31:33.440 --> 31:35.419
Which of us does not secretly adore him?

31:46.800 --> 31:48.779
How different might our lives have been...

31:51.120 --> 31:53.099
Had Ross not returned from the war?

31:54.360 --> 31:56.339
Had he never gone away in the first place.

31:59.400 --> 32:02.028
Goodbye, my dear. God bless you.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.182
Francis!

32:39.440 --> 32:41.419
- No.
- Hey...

32:42.640 --> 32:44.619
You'll come home again?

32:47.320 --> 32:49.299
I promise.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.901
Ross!

34:00.440 --> 34:01.987
PENVENEN: You spoilhim.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.981
How else could I persuade him
to come to Bodmin with me?

34:05.160 --> 34:07.549
Indeed, he wonders why
either of us must go at all.

34:07.720 --> 34:11.747
You_tell him it is because
tonight is election night

34:11.920 --> 34:15.981
and as Unwin's intended,
you are expected to be at his side.

34:16.160 --> 34:19.823
Horace and I will spend an agreeable evening
in our lodgings eating jellies.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.103
- Caroline...
- What?

34:21.280 --> 34:23.942
You'd prefer I caught a cold in
some draughty assembly rooms

34:24.120 --> 34:25.985
watching dreary men voting?

34:26.160 --> 34:29.744
I may venture out later,
if Horace can spare me.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.467
Bodmin, Horace.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.858
I bet nothing of moment ever happens there.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.264
(Town crier calling out)

35:48.480 --> 35:50.459
Your room, sir.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.940
Beg pardon, sir,
be you a surgeon or such like?

35:57.120 --> 35:58.144
Iam.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.584
There's someone took mortal sick
at Priory House.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.739
I'll go at once.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.019
(Approaching horses and carriage)

36:24.640 --> 36:26.505
Verity!

36:26.680 --> 36:28.545
I've saved you a place, my dear.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.699
Thank you.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.699
(Driver commands horses)

36:36.160 --> 36:38.583
- You did tell Ross you're coming?
- Of course not.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.179
(Laughter and chatter)

36:53.160 --> 36:55.025
Jeffrey Clymer, King's Counsel.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.509
I'm here to see
ifwe can wriggle you offthe hook.

37:03.880 --> 37:08.385
"Theft, inciting a riot,
attacking a customs officer."

37:10.200 --> 37:12.179
Impressive.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.579
I'm a physician, ma'am. May I be of service?

37:18.760 --> 37:23.629
I hope so. My darling little Horace has had
two fits and now he's barely breathing.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.904
- Will you attend on him, please?
- (Whining)

37:27.120 --> 37:29.099
Your dog?

37:30.120 --> 37:33.100
Your footman made a mistake.
It would be a farrier you sent him for.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.703
It's not my custom to employ
a horse doctor for Horace.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.984
I want the best advice
and I'm willing to pay for it.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.424
- What is your fee?
- (Sighs)

37:40.600 --> 37:42.784
But perhaps you do not know
your trade well enough.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.178
Perhaps you should leave.
We'll call someone else.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.578
That was what I was about to suggest.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.259
Wait.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.104
Have you never had a dog of your own?

37:55.280 --> 37:57.259
Yes.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.664
Would you let him die
on a point offormality?

38:06.680 --> 38:08.545
- How old is he?
- 12 months.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.585
Fits are not uncommon at that age.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.739
An aunt of mine had a spaniel.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.579
His pulse is steady
and there's no sign offever.

38:32.760 --> 38:35.866
Nevertheless,
I'd advise a lowering system oftreatment.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.429
No more sweetmeats,
plenty of running and jumping.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.580
Dogs do not need to be carried.

38:43.560 --> 38:48.907
Have a druggist make up this paregoric
of black cherry water and Theban opium.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.659
Thank you.

38:55.480 --> 38:58.620
You were saying?
About your aunt's spaniel.

38:58.800 --> 39:03.305
Oh. Er...yes. He used to have fits,
when she played the spinet.

39:04.440 --> 39:07.102
One hesitates to say whether
he was musical or the reverse.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.979
What is your name?

39:14.400 --> 39:15.628
Following to your arrest,

39:15.800 --> 39:18.701
your statement to the examining magistrate
was unhelpful.

39:18.880 --> 39:22.145
I answered truthfully.
Is that not what the law requires?

39:22.320 --> 39:25.699
A common misconception is the truth
is the same as innocence. It is not.

39:25.880 --> 39:30.465
Myjob is to position the truth
so that you don't pay for it with your life.

39:30.640 --> 39:32.505
I see.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.864
So now we're politicians.

39:35.960 --> 39:38.064
Positioning the facts
to suit our own ends.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.026
And the people on the beach that day?

39:40.200 --> 39:42.225
Shall we pretend
that they were not desperate?

39:42.400 --> 39:45.028
Should we explain that starvation
and poverty are also relative?

39:45.200 --> 39:50.388
Let me be clear. Anything other than
absolute contrition would be sheer folly.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.380
So my task is to grovel?

39:54.040 --> 39:56.144
Play the game by bending the rules.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.299
Excellent.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.299
(Bell clanging, shouting)

40:04.680 --> 40:06.147
Thank you.

40:10.080 --> 40:14.221
Oh, this town's a-boiling.
I forgot it was election week.

40:14.400 --> 40:18.427
Yes, I lately met one ofthe candidates.
A friend of our neighbour Penvenen.

40:19.800 --> 40:23.179
Indeed, later I must go out on an errand.

40:23.360 --> 40:26.818
- With the streets full of drunkards?
- 'Tis for Ross I must do it.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.108
(Hubbub)

40:29.280 --> 40:33.182
- When are the votes to be counted?
- Not until this evening, sir.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.979
Have you seen this?

40:43.160 --> 40:46.027
There's been an assassination
of Ross Poldark's character.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.027
How unfortunate.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.939
- Not a single room?
- I'm sorry, sir, we're full.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.179
- In the entire inn?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.179
(Scoffs)

41:00.480 --> 41:02.345
Enys. Are you here for the trial?

41:02.520 --> 41:04.784
- I am indeed. And you?
- Yes, I thought to look in.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.861
Look, erm... do you know where
I can find a room for the night?

41:09.040 --> 41:12.419
This place is full
and the town is fermenting with people.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.023
You may be unluclq.
I trust your sister had the foresight

41:15.200 --> 41:17.384
- to reserve her_room at The Crown?
- Verity's here?

41:17.560 --> 41:19.744
I saw her go in just now, with Demelza.

41:19.920 --> 41:22.104
Is your wife with you?

41:22.280 --> 41:25.260
Erm...Elizabeth prefers
to remain at Trenwith.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.702
If erm...ifyou should be
without a place to sleep tonight,

41:29.880 --> 41:31.745
I'm at the London Inn,
beside the church.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.899
You may be held to that.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.699
Terrible thing!

41:48.600 --> 41:51.580
A man of his standing,
and that young wife of his.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.026
Francis, are you joining us?

41:55.200 --> 41:57.862
Will I not be interrupting
your council ofwar?

41:59.120 --> 42:01.065
- Against whom?
- My cousin.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.822
As declared in your recent literary effort.

42:04.840 --> 42:05.909
Excuse me.

42:06.080 --> 42:08.947
It is a piece offiction
entirely worthy of you!

42:11.320 --> 42:12.981
Tell me...

42:13.160 --> 42:17.859
what could induce you to throw your weight
behind Ross instead of against him?

42:18.040 --> 42:20.099
The very same question
your wife asked me.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.583
Naturally, I could not now consider it.

42:24.760 --> 42:27.422
Ross has offered me insolence
once too ofen.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.579
In that case, may I offer you some advice?

42:30.720 --> 42:33.746
- By all means.
- You may flaunt your guineas

42:33.920 --> 42:36.309
on lavish garments and fancy carriages.

42:37.160 --> 42:41.062
You may purchase a coat of arms
and deck out your servants in gaudy livery.

42:41.240 --> 42:46.223
You may even buy your way into every club,
mine and drawing room in the county,

42:46.400 --> 42:49.221
but what you will never buy...

42:50.760 --> 42:52.739
..is nobility.

42:53.040 --> 42:56.988
Or breeding. Or even common decency.

43:00.400 --> 43:03.221
Are you quite sure you don't wish to apologise,
Francis?

43:03.400 --> 43:06.346
Given the nature of our association?

43:08.600 --> 43:10.784
Oh, you own me, I acknowledge that.

43:11.480 --> 43:14.347
And my indebtedness to you
has long muddied the waters between us,

43:14.520 --> 43:18.149
so I trust that any confusion...about my
feelings...

43:19.160 --> 43:21.628
..is now entirely cleared up.

43:53.560 --> 43:56.984
I'll visit you in gaol with a list ofwitnesses
who are to appear against you.

43:57.800 --> 44:00.143
And those for me?

44:00.320 --> 44:02.379
A shorter list.

44:02.560 --> 44:07.099
Friends' and workers' testimony,
presumed biased, will be easily dismissed.

44:07.280 --> 44:10.306
Meanwhile, I advise you
to reconsider your attitude.

44:10.480 --> 44:13.506
_ It's no detriment to me
if you choose to run your neck into a noose.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.179
But I suspect it might be to yours.

44:31.800 --> 44:35.099
Mr Warleggan.
I see Unwin speaks the truth.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.986
He cannot stir an inch without you.

44:37.160 --> 44:38.741
- He says the same of you.
- Of course.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.263
We're both indispensable
to his ascent in the world.

44:41.440 --> 44:43.544
- I, as a hunting trophy...
- Caroline...

44:43.720 --> 44:46.780
And you as...how to describe you?

44:46.960 --> 44:49.827
Benefactor? Sponsor? Paymaster?

44:50.000 --> 44:52.821
I am certainly lending my support
to his campaign.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.026
- Shall we go out and wave to the crowd?
- And I am lending mine to his arm.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.623
I wonder which one of us
stands to gain the most.

46:17.920 --> 46:19.899
(Cell door clangs, keys jangle)

46:34.280 --> 46:36.145
Are you sure Ross meant you to go out alone?

46:36.320 --> 46:38.265
You're a lady, after all.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.499
I was brought up a miner's daughter.

46:41.520 --> 46:44.739
There's naught a few drunkards could do
that I couldn't give 'em back.

46:47.160 --> 46:49.139
(Chatter)

46:50.520 --> 46:55.787
"I am a voice crying in the wilderness!
Make ye ready the ways ofthe Lord.

46:55.960 --> 46:58.064
For the kingdom of God is at hand!"

46:58.240 --> 47:00.219
Father?

47:02.720 --> 47:07.419
So. Now 'ee be cast into the pit, daughter?

47:08.920 --> 47:11.627
Thy child is buried,
thy husband's to hang.

47:11.800 --> 47:13.825
See now the wages of sin?

47:14.000 --> 47:17.060
- I know of no sin.
- Turn again now, daughter.

47:18.880 --> 47:21.781
- Come home and live a pure life.
- Thank you, Father.

47:21.960 --> 47:25.464
I appreciate the offer, but...
I hope it will not be needed.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.983
"'Vengeance is mine' sayeth the Lord.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.663
'For the day of calamity is at hand."'

47:49.320 --> 47:51.299
(Knock at door)

47:51.960 --> 47:53.222
What have you forgot, Demelza?

47:53.400 --> 47:55.948
- Oh.
- Have you brandy?

47:57.080 --> 47:59.059
- Or rum?
- There's port.

48:02.320 --> 48:04.185
Demelza's tipple.

48:04.360 --> 48:06.339
(Glass clinks, drink poured)

48:09.320 --> 48:11.299
Well, sister...

48:13.800 --> 48:15.779
(Sighs)

48:17.440 --> 48:19.385
How's it feel to be married
to a drunken brute?

48:19.560 --> 48:21.221
Francis, I hoped...

48:21.400 --> 48:23.379
What, that I'd come to make peace?

48:24.400 --> 48:28.063
With my sister, perhaps.
But not with a Mistress Blamey.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.105
We're happy, Francis.

48:30.280 --> 48:32.589
And I hope the day will come
when you'll be glad for me.

48:32.760 --> 48:35.103
- And allow me home to _Trenwith.
- As soon as you like.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.145
As soon as you like.

48:38.320 --> 48:40.299
Without him.

48:41.480 --> 48:44.699
Oh, do I disappoint you?
Well, I disappoint most people.

48:44.880 --> 48:48.907
Father. Elizabeth. Myself.

48:50.360 --> 48:53.181
Why is it that I amount
to precisely nothing?

48:55.200 --> 48:58.909
Whereas Ross...
Ross is considered such a threat

48:59.080 --> 49:02.664
that men will spend a fortune
in order to get him hanged!

49:04.160 --> 49:06.139
- And yet I envy him.
- You cannot.

49:06.320 --> 49:08.345
IfI were going to meet myjudges...

49:09.760 --> 49:11.625
..I would give them a piece of my mind.

49:11.800 --> 49:15.019
Francis Poldark Esquire, of Trenwith!

49:16.800 --> 49:18.665
Wouldn't be the first time today.

49:18.840 --> 49:23.425
I...I met a man, handing out pamphlets
defaming Ross in the grossest manner

49:23.600 --> 49:25.739
and I happen to know ofthe author.

49:25.920 --> 49:28.104
And so I went and paid him a visit.

49:28.880 --> 49:30.859
And left him in no doubt
as to my opinion.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.425
George.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.228
Was that wise when he owns
the very roof over your head?

49:37.400 --> 49:39.903
Oh, no doubt he's planning this moment
how to punish me.

49:41.080 --> 49:43.059
But he may be defrauded.

49:44.160 --> 49:46.139
Do not lose heart, Francis.

49:47.480 --> 49:49.459
Tomorrow's a new day.

49:50.720 --> 49:52.699
A new day.

49:53.720 --> 49:55.699
And it may never come.

50:08.520 --> 50:10.385
I wonder if I shouldn't go to Bodmin.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.300
To what purpose?

50:12.480 --> 50:13.868
To be with Francis.

50:16.120 --> 50:17.587
And his cousin?

50:18.640 --> 50:20.744
Ross has Demelza.

50:21.920 --> 50:23.899
Hm.

50:52.600 --> 50:55.023
Be advised, sir.
The woman approaching is a harlot

50:55.200 --> 50:57.668
and must, on no account, be admitted.

51:01.800 --> 51:02.903
Excuse me, sirs.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.583
Entry to the assembly rooms
is for voters only.

51:06.040 --> 51:09.100
I've come to see Mr Penvenen.
He particularly asked for me.

51:09.280 --> 51:11.498
- I bet he did.
- You can't come in.

51:11.680 --> 51:16.140
I beg you to let me through.
'Tis all the reason I've come to Bodmin.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.300
- My husband's life depends on it.
- Move along now.

51:21.200 --> 51:23.065
Move along now!

51:23.240 --> 51:27.142
Are you sure Dr Enys was agreeable
to 'ee sharing his chamber?

51:28.200 --> 51:30.589
This is a small chamber, sir.
And but a single bed.

51:30.760 --> 51:33.183
I shall not be needing a bed.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.579
(Angry shouting from outside)

51:46.400 --> 51:48.618
(Door opens and closes)

51:49.880 --> 51:52.826
Oh, my dear, I was so worried.
The crowds in the square...

51:55.160 --> 51:57.025
What is it? Did it all go wrong?

51:57.200 --> 51:59.179
Not exactly.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.581
(Footsteps)

52:09.760 --> 52:11.227
I'm in no mood for visitors.

52:11.400 --> 52:13.379
- (Keys jangle)
- Sounds ominous.

52:20.080 --> 52:22.059
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

52:24.240 --> 52:26.219
I was writing to my wife.

52:29.560 --> 52:34.065
I've not come to fight, Ross. But to confess.

52:36.160 --> 52:41.621
Confess myself disarmed. Impressed.

52:44.200 --> 52:47.829
Well, of course you might have guessed
Elizabeth would ask me to intervene.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.867
But would you guess that Francis did, too?

52:52.840 --> 52:54.899
That Ray Penvenen
tried to fight your corner?

52:56.080 --> 52:58.548
Alfred Barbery, Lord Deveran.

53:01.400 --> 53:05.382
How do you inspire such loyalty?
It impresses me.

53:07.560 --> 53:12.259
I see its value. I could use it.

53:14.920 --> 53:16.899
I could do what they asked me to do.

53:18.080 --> 53:21.504
Remove the hostile witnesses,
drop a word in the ear ofthe prosecution.

53:22.640 --> 53:25.461
I could even take the stand
and give you a character reference.

53:25.640 --> 53:27.028
How would that sway the jury?

53:27.200 --> 53:29.179
The very man whose cousin perished?

53:33.080 --> 53:35.059
What do you say, Ross?

53:36.360 --> 53:38.339
Will you meet me halfway?

53:40.240 --> 53:42.299
Will you take the hand offriendship?

53:53.360 --> 53:55.339
Forgive me.

53:57.320 --> 53:59.538
Are you truly so deluded?

54:02.600 --> 54:05.785
Do you think I would
ever shake your hand?

54:12.240 --> 54:14.140
(Chuckles)

54:14.320 --> 54:18.142
No. No, not for a single moment.

54:20.240 --> 54:21.628
But when you go to the gallows,

54:21.800 --> 54:24.303
I'll be able to say, hand on heart,
to Elizabeth,

54:24.480 --> 54:28.780
I offered Ross Poldark my help
and he turned me down.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.785
So, thank you.

54:33.960 --> 54:39.307
For being every bit as predictable
as I hoped you'd be.

54:41.160 --> 54:43.139
And thank you.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.979
For reminding me what can
and cannot be bought.

54:55.280 --> 54:57.145
(Keys jangle)

54:57.320 --> 54:59.299
(Cell door clangs shut)

55:41.480 --> 55:43.345
My clear, where are you going?

55:43.520 --> 55:45.499
I have one last thing I must try.

56:16.600 --> 56:20.309
(Bell tolling)
