00:02.711 --> 00:03.826
Who's there?

00:03.921 --> 00:05.411
I'm just a voice in your head.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.417
Think of me as your guide.

00:07.549 --> 00:08.584
EMMA: Someone needs to watch me.

00:08.717 --> 00:11.083
You're the only one who would
do what is necessary.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.515
Merlin prophesized your coming here
a long time ago.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.759
We're back.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.181
We were just walking into Camelot.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.769
-How long were we gone?
-Six weeks.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.431
Our memories, they're gone.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.769
Why are you doing this?

00:22.898 --> 00:23.887
Because

00:23.941 --> 00:25.397
I am the Dark One.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.440
(TIRES SCREECHING)

LEROY: Come on!

00:36.787 --> 00:38.948
Someone's got to see
what this new curse does.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.028
Any volunteers?

00:40.123 --> 00:41.909
HAPPY: I don't want to turn
into a monkey.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.699
SLEEPY: I like remembering who I am.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.534
I'm afraid one of us is gonna have to
dig down deep

00:45.629 --> 00:47.039
and find the courage
to see what happens

00:47.130 --> 00:48.745
when we step over that line.

00:48.799 --> 00:49.879
-Not it.
-Not it.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.082
-Not it.
-Dopey...

00:52.302 --> 00:55.135
I'll take your silence as bravery.
Good for you.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.553
Come on.

REGINA: Stop!

01:06.149 --> 01:07.810
Sorry, sister.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.813
We can't stay in Storybrooke
as long as Emma's the Dark One.

01:10.904 --> 01:15.489
Snow Queen. Pan. Trio of Terror.
We can handle villains like that.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.486
But Emma,

01:17.578 --> 01:19.318
she was one of us.

01:19.454 --> 01:22.161
She knows how we beat bad guys.
Hell, she beat most of them for us.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.916
So tell me,
how do we stand a chance against her?

01:26.003 --> 01:28.460
If you're dumb enough to cross the line,
be my guest.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.670
Who's gonna save us if we stay? You?

01:32.968 --> 01:34.833
Go on. Do it.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.358
Now, if you'll excuse us.

No.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.376
Oh, well, that's new.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.059
Wow.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.312
DAVID: Wow is right.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.164
And now, allow me to introduce
the loveliest creature in all of Camelot,

02:48.251 --> 02:49.240
my Queen,

02:50.212 --> 02:51.247
Guinevere.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.929
Your majesty.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.262
The pleasure is ours.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.188
We have been awaiting your arrival

03:12.275 --> 03:14.607
from the moment we heard
Merlin's prophecy.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.068
Well, we hope you haven't been
waiting too long.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.604
Only a decade or so.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.526
(CHUCKLES) Ah, sorry.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.118
ARTHUR: l wager it's been
worth the wait.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.280
And as a bonus,
it's given us more than enough time

03:24.371 --> 03:26.077
to prepare a ball in your honor tonight.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.615
Oh, see. Told you we should come.
Look what we've been missing out on.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.952
-I like any party I don't have to cater.
-So do we.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.129
Is this really necessary?

03:36.216 --> 03:39.128
You're lucky you're not locked
in Granny's freezer.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.130
Take it off,

03:41.263 --> 03:44.050
or | tell Arthur he just welcomed
the Dark One into his...

03:44.141 --> 03:45.301
(GAGGING)

03:45.392 --> 03:48.259
What's that, sis? I can't hear you.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.595
No one here knows who we are.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.479
And it's going to stay that way.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.559
So you can either behave and pretend
to be my mute handmaiden

03:56.653 --> 03:59.144
or go back to Granny's,

03:59.281 --> 04:01.567
where you can
rely on Doc for prenatal care.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.162
We don't have time to waste
on a bloody dance.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.116
I'm not going to go dark in one night.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.576
I'm not willing to take that chance.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.749
Your Majesty.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.792
When are we gonna start our quest
to find Merlin?

04:14.838 --> 04:16.578
ARTHUR: Well, "find him"?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.790
We don't need to find him.
We know exactly where he is.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.514
So the most powerful sorcerer
in all the realms

04:27.642 --> 04:29.849
is stuck inside a bloody tree?

04:29.978 --> 04:32.344
I said the same exact thing
the first time I stood there.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.267
And you think we can get him out?

04:34.691 --> 04:35.851
Oh, we don't think.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.523
We know.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.522
Merlin's prophecies are never wrong.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.197
PERCIVAL: Why are you so eager
to free him?

04:42.616 --> 04:45.107
Our home is being threatened by...

04:46.369 --> 04:47.779
It's called the Dark One.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.370
The Dark One?

04:51.666 --> 04:53.042
Yes, we're well aware of that demon.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.041
That is bad.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.877
Well, I pray Merlin can help.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.712
But first, we must
free him from his prison.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.962
It is said one of you is the Savior.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.845
So which of you is it?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.473
BOTH: |...

05:14.564 --> 05:16.145
Am the Savior.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.482
I'm the one who's going to
free Merlin from that tree,

05:23.573 --> 05:25.529
and then we can
take care of the Dark One.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.241
And all go home.

05:44.219 --> 05:47.382
I need to know why it didn't work
for you and the bloody crocodile.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.551
Well, it did work the first time.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.266
lt awoke the man behind the beast.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.054
But Rumple got scared
of a life without power,

05:57.107 --> 06:00.270
and he chose power over love.

06:01.778 --> 06:05.362
He pulled away from me,
and in that moment,

06:05.448 --> 06:08.576
the darkness forever
regained its grip on him.

06:09.744 --> 06:13.111
You know,
a curse isn't a curse anymore

06:13.206 --> 06:14.616
when the afflicted wants it.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.289
That won't be a problem with Emma.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.535
Killian, wait.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.130
I know you think
you could handle a Dark One...

06:21.214 --> 06:23.250
l battled him for centuries,
I'm still here.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.086
But you were trying to kill him.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.716
And now, well...

06:28.138 --> 06:33.258
It's far easier to hate a Dark One
than it is to love one.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.975
Be careful.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.977

Henry?

06:47.073 --> 06:48.108
Mom?

06:49.951 --> 06:51.907
You don't have to be scared of me.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.986
What happened?

06:54.122 --> 06:55.237
Why are you like this now?

06:55.665 --> 06:57.496
lt's complicated.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.791
I'm sorry, Mom.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.453
Whatever happened in Camelot,

07:02.839 --> 07:05.000
I'm sorry we failed you.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.333
I know what I said last night,
but, Henry, you didn't fail me.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.089
Everyone else did.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.671
Get away from my son.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.097
What's the matter, Regina?

07:15.185 --> 07:17.676
Are you afraid Henry will learn the truth
about what happened in Camelot?

07:17.812 --> 07:20.519
If the truth is so important to you,

07:21.316 --> 07:22.681
why did you erase our memories?

07:22.817 --> 07:24.432
It's a curse, Regina.

07:24.527 --> 07:28.190
I know.
But what I can't figure out is why.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.818
If I wanted you to know,
I wouldn't have erased your memories.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.700
You know we won't stop
until we get them back.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.653
That's not going to happen, Regina.
Because I did learn from you.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.322
And I built this curse without
the one thing you need to break it,

07:40.877 --> 07:41.992
a Savior.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.872
Hmm.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.372
Well, we'll all find a way.
We always have.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.715
Yes. With me.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.674
Now you're on your own.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.632
You can do it, Mom.
You can be the Savior.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.014
It's not going to happen.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.012
You don't think l have it in me?

08:01.690 --> 08:02.975
I know you don't.

08:03.692 --> 08:04.898
Well, you're wrong.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.732
I can protect this town.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.693
We'll see about that.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.569
Because there is a problem
headed to Storybrooke

08:10.657 --> 08:13.148
that only a Savior can solve.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.072
It's too bad there isn't one.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.251
We just can't leave him there,
he'll starve.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.086
Well, what do trees eat?

08:27.132 --> 08:28.121
Sunlight?

08:28.216 --> 08:29.205
He liked tacos.

08:29.259 --> 08:32.717

gonna give a tree a taco?

08:32.762 --> 08:35.504
-Yeah.
-(HORSE WHINNYING)

08:45.859 --> 08:49.272

mess with a dwarf and his pickax?

(GRUNTS)

08:54.117 --> 08:55.323
(GROANS)

08:56.369 --> 08:58.860
Didn't anyone ever teach you
to kneel before a king?

08:59.289 --> 09:03.248
Now, tell me, where am |,
and how the hell did I get here?

09:04.085 --> 09:05.200
A curse?

09:05.295 --> 09:06.410
That brought you to our realm

09:06.463 --> 09:08.454
and wiped the last six weeks
from your memory.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.705
Who would do that?

09:11.468 --> 09:14.631
We weren't completely honest with you
on the way to Camelot.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.469
MARY: Our daughter, Emma, was...

09:17.390 --> 09:20.598
Is the Dark One. She cast the curse.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.600
You lied to me?

09:23.646 --> 09:26.308
You let me lead the darkest of souls
into the heart of my kingdom?

09:26.399 --> 09:29.061
We thought Merlin would be able
to destroy the darkness inside her.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.394
Well, obviously that didn't work out.
Where's the Dark One now?

09:32.489 --> 09:33.478
MARY: Emma.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.105
She's here in Storybrooke.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.149
Well, then there's only
one way to defeat her.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.650
The Dark One dagger.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.952
Defeat isn't exactly
what we had in mind.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.157
She's our daughter.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.076
And...

09:44.167 --> 09:45.498
Well, she has the dagger.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.290
I'm afraid you and your knights
aren't the only ones

09:50.340 --> 09:52.001
that Emma dragged here from Camelot.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.174
Little John said he ran into
some of your subjects in a forest.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.420
Are they all right?

09:55.512 --> 09:56.501
They're a little shaken up.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.674
But there may still be
some of them out there.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.429
I'm gonna round up the Merry Men
and search the East Woods.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.927
I'll take the dwarfs,
we'll start in the west.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.007
Arthur, you're with me.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.772
What is it?

10:09.859 --> 10:12.942
These toy soldiers,

10:13.029 --> 10:15.315
I could kill them all
with a wave of my hand.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.445
Regina.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.319
Well, I don't mean I will.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.484
My point is this can't be
what Emma warned me about.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.119
She obviously
brought them here for a reason.

10:23.665 --> 10:27.157
She said we were going to face
a problem only a Savior can handle.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.876
I'm telling you,

10:31.005 --> 10:34.293
something else is coming our way.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.674
REGINA: Merlin's tower.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.882
There must be something in here
to help get him out of the tree.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.893
Never do that to me again.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.972
Oh, now you're talking to me.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.516
I don't know. Am I allowed to?

10:52.735 --> 10:54.066
(REGINA SIGHS)

10:54.154 --> 10:55.985
You gave this to me.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.063
To protect me. Not use against me.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.405
I saved your life.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.365
-By pretending to be me?
-Oh, shut up and listen.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.402
Oh.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.155
I can get used to this.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.285
(SIGHS)

11:08.376 --> 11:11.664
Look, if you told Arthur
you were the Savior,

11:11.754 --> 11:13.164
he would have asked you to free Merlin.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.046
You would have had to use magic.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.586
Dark magic.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.755
Do you remember what happened
last time you dabbled in that?

11:19.888 --> 11:20.923
I lost control.

11:21.014 --> 11:25.098
And you gave me this dagger
so that wouldn't happen again.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.602
But I wasn't lying.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.056
I don't care what
Merlin's prophecy says.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.272
I'm gonna figure out
how I can get that wizard out.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.104

28:06.935 --> 28:08.596
But none came.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.053
Only an Angel of Death.

28:11.148 --> 28:15.391
And she slipped through the flames,
relishing in the horror she wrought.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.943
But before she escaped,
she saw the boy.

28:20.157 --> 28:24.571
And amidst the carnage,
do you know what she did?

28:27.748 --> 28:29.158
She smiled at him.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.785
You were the boy.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.542
And you were the Evil Queen.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.796
Who else knows? Who have you told?

28:37.883 --> 28:39.089
No one.

28:40.844 --> 28:41.959
Why not?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.386
Because Arthur would have
stopped me from doing this.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.301

28:49.811 --> 28:52.598
No, Swan. You can't use dark magic.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.961
You know, it's customary
to bring a gift for a housewarming.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.420
Maybe a nice bottle of wine?

29:26.515 --> 29:27.800
We need to talk.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.973
Well, I suppose we could bottle
that rage and drink it instead.

You're right. I'm not the Savior.

with the rest of us.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.019
I don't have a choice.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.814
I know the only way
to stop the Fury is to pay its price.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.437
Then why aren't you off, paying it?

29:39.528 --> 29:41.109
Because I know what it is.

-No?

I am done fixing your problems.

You called it here.

for someone else to blame.

The whole point
was not for Robin to die.
