WEBVTT

00:06.374 --> 00:08.442
(indistinct shouting
and laughing)

00:10.111 --> 00:13.681
(marching band playing)

00:13.714 --> 00:16.617
State's gonna crush 'em.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.553
I still can't believe
you got tickets.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.689
Promised you I would, son.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.092
Just took a little longer
than I hoped.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.659
Come on.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.761
Come on!

00:27.795 --> 00:29.663
We're okay, Dad.
Don't worry about it.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.700
It's my fault.
We should have left earlier.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.702
Dad, really, it's okay.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.610
Dad?

00:42.643 --> 00:44.745
No!

00:44.778 --> 00:47.148
Dad! Dad! Dad!

00:47.181 --> 00:48.849
(gun cocks)
What are you doing?!

00:48.882 --> 00:50.784
No, stop!

00:50.818 --> 00:51.819
Hey!

00:53.121 --> 00:54.322
Dad!

00:54.355 --> 00:56.657
Dad! Dad!

00:56.690 --> 00:59.260
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:59.293 --> 01:01.762
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:01.795 --> 01:04.465
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:04.498 --> 01:05.733
* How, how, how, how

01:05.766 --> 01:08.102
* Hey, hey

01:13.741 --> 01:15.343
* You gotta come on.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.785
LASALLE: Shooter's a gunner's
mate out of Belle Chasse, King.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.488
Witnesses say he just started
shooting for no reason.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.357
All went down pretty fast.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.858
Sebastian.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.493
How's the boy?

01:32.526 --> 01:34.162
He's still in shock,
poor guy.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.231
LASALLE: No. Doc's here
doing her prelim now.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.567
We'll canvass the scene,
see you when you get here.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.801
Pride and Gregorio
are on their way.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.603
Yeah, well,
so is the boy's mom.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.705
I didn't even really know
what to say to him, you know?

01:44.738 --> 01:46.274
It's not really something
they go over in training.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.775
Yeah. It's the toughest
part of the job,

01:47.808 --> 01:49.877
talking to survivors
and loved ones.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.679
Best thing we can do
is find some answers

01:51.712 --> 01:53.414
and figure out
what happened.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.583
Yeah, well, what happened
seems pretty clear.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.285
I mean, his dad just lost it
and snapped.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.619
Any idea what
triggered it?

01:58.652 --> 01:59.753
Not enough to make him
do what he did.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.756
Eddie, his son, said that he
was agitated by the traffic

02:02.790 --> 02:04.425
and then just
started shooting.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.859
Well, that doesn't
make sense.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.761
People just don't
suddenly snap

02:07.795 --> 02:09.763
and start shooting
for no reason.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.167
Based on the amount
of blood loss,

02:13.201 --> 02:15.603
I'd say at least one of
the security guard's bullets

02:15.636 --> 02:17.338
severed Mr. Ridley's aorta.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.739
Died instantly?
Yeah.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.608
Lucky he's the only one who did,

02:20.641 --> 02:21.775
shooting like that
in a crowded area.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.277
You know what caused it?

02:23.311 --> 02:24.812
Meds, hallucinogens, alcohol?

02:24.845 --> 02:26.547
There's no obvious outward sign.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.649
I'll run the tox screen
when I get back.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.883
However,

02:29.917 --> 02:31.652
there is one
curious thing.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.821
It's a recent incision,

02:33.854 --> 02:35.823
still healing.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.659
Could indicate Mr. Ridley had
some kind of brain surgery.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.329
I'll know more when
I get him on my table.
(phone chirps)

02:41.362 --> 02:42.863
LASALLE:
Oh, man.

02:43.831 --> 02:44.798
Everything all right?

02:44.832 --> 02:46.834
King just texted.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.837
He and Gregorio are taking
a detour to Ochsner Medical.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.674
Wait, what? Why?
Patton's been in an accident.

02:53.707 --> 02:56.244
I'm okay. It's
no big deal.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.346
(gasps)
Aye, ya.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.581
I just misjudged the landing
a little, that's all.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.650
Landing? What landing, Patton?

03:02.683 --> 03:03.951
What were you doing?

03:03.984 --> 03:05.819
Okay. Doctor wants you
back in a week or so,

03:05.853 --> 03:06.954
to get the stitches removed.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.456
I'll go get your
discharge papers.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.891
Thank you.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.493
GREGORIO:
Hello.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.462
Somebody want to tell me

03:14.495 --> 03:15.529
what's going on?

03:17.265 --> 03:19.633
You might as well tell her
before she kicks your butt.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.470
That's exactly what I'm afraid's
gonna happen if I do tell her.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.571
Tell me what?

03:23.604 --> 03:25.639
Every once in a while,
I like to do

03:25.673 --> 03:27.941
a little paragliding.
Paragliding?

03:27.975 --> 03:29.910
Wait. You mean like with the
parachute when you drop

03:29.943 --> 03:31.412
from the sky? You're
kidding me. He's kidding.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.780
See, that's why I
didn't want to tell her.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.348
Bound to find out
sooner or later.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.749
Wait. And you're
okay with this?

03:35.783 --> 03:36.950
Are you two out of your minds?

03:36.984 --> 03:38.352
You could have gotten killed.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.688
Relax. Okay?
Relax?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.823
Look, I've been doing stuff
like this my whole life.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.858
I ain't gonna stop now
'cause I use a chair.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.927
I know what I'm doing.
Yeah, clearly. Do me a favor,

03:46.960 --> 03:48.362
talk some sense
into him, please.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.963
Lost that battle years ago.

03:49.997 --> 03:50.864
Ugh.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.769
Still, neither of us are
as young as we used to be.

03:55.803 --> 03:56.970
Might want to consider that,

03:57.004 --> 03:58.939
if nothing else.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.808
PATTON:
Oh, boy.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.510
Hey, Patton.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.544
Marlene.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.846
Sorry. I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

04:05.879 --> 04:06.914
I was worried about you.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.883
Marlene Bell, Tammy Gregorio,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.553
Dwayne Pride.
These are my coworkers.
Hey.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.722
MARLENE: Hello.
PATTON: Marlene runs the
paragliding business.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.291
She probably worried she's about
to lose her best customer.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.926
That's not true,
and you know it.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.561
Don't worry.
I'm gonna be up and flying

04:20.594 --> 04:22.396
in no time.
Oh, that's a great idea.

04:22.430 --> 04:25.333
Maybe next time you'll crack
that thick skull of yours open.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.403
Just her way of caring.
She's from New York.

04:29.437 --> 04:32.373
(phone chimes)
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
she's not making sense.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.708
Just saying. Oh,
I got to get back

04:34.742 --> 04:36.910
to the squad room, catch up
on the case. Are you good?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.713
Absolutely. Let's get to work.
No, no, no.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.749
You're gonna go home and
get some rest, Patton.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.652
Doctor's orders.
Mine, too.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.587
Nice to meet you.
You, too.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.623
(scoffs)

04:51.492 --> 04:52.926
How's Patton doing?
Is he okay?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.094
Don't even start with me.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.330
She's upset.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.866
She didn't know that Patton
was a paraglider.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.934
Oh, yeah. But he doesn't
just paraglide.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.036
He asked me to go bungee jumping
with him once.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.406
Yeah. But I was like,
"How about instead of that,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.675
I just, you know, stay alive?"

05:07.708 --> 05:09.677
Okay, what's the deal?
Why does he do this?

05:09.710 --> 05:11.579
SEBASTIAN: Honestly,
I-I think it's really cool.

05:11.612 --> 05:12.846
For him, at least,
you know?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.482
He-he won't let
the chair hold him back.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.116
No, but there's got to be
something more to it

05:16.149 --> 05:18.051
than that because he said he's
been doing it his whole life.

05:18.085 --> 05:21.355
So most people thrill-seek
for fun, some to run.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.757
I mean, why does Patton do it?

05:23.791 --> 05:26.594
It's probably better if we stick
to our dead sailor first.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.829
PRIDE: Yeah.
Just got off the phone
with his Navy shrink.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.063
Any idea what
made him snap?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.999
Said he suffered from PTSS,

05:32.032 --> 05:34.668
but he said he's been
making remarkable progress

05:34.702 --> 05:35.936
for a while now.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.838
Even volunteered
for research studies

05:37.871 --> 05:38.972
to help those
afflicted by it.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.908
Well, something had
to have triggered him

05:40.941 --> 05:43.611
to go off like that.
Question is: what?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.546
Doc Wade might have
found the answer.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.015
So it turns out that Ridley did,
in fact, have brain surgery

05:48.048 --> 05:51.018
not too long ago, but it wasn't
to fix something,

05:51.051 --> 05:53.153
it was to implant something.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.855
What is that?

05:54.888 --> 05:57.090
I think that it's
a neural interface.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.527
Yeah. Okay, so follow me
on this, all right?

05:59.560 --> 06:00.794
Elon Musk, Google, Apple,

06:00.828 --> 06:02.530
they've all been
upping their research

06:02.563 --> 06:04.097
into wizard hats,
as they're known.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.066
Blending brains and computers.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.435
It's pretty cutting-edge stuff.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.669
Pretty creepy, too.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.937
What's it supposed to do?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.639
Well, I think that this one

06:11.672 --> 06:13.106
was designed to stimulate
targeted areas

06:13.140 --> 06:14.875
of the brain
with electrical pulses.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.510
Kind of like what they've
been trying to do recently

06:16.544 --> 06:18.111
to control Parkinson's
or epilepsy.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.113
Or PTSS?
Yeah. I think

06:20.147 --> 06:22.115
this could be the research study
that he was involved with.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.784
A little zap
to the limbic center

06:23.817 --> 06:25.018
when anger or depression hits

06:25.052 --> 06:26.654
could just stabilize the subject

06:26.687 --> 06:28.956
without the messy side effects
of pharmaceuticals.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.858
Still, messing
with people's brains is

06:30.891 --> 06:32.960
a slippery slope.
Especially if
something goes wrong.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.962
It's hard to believe that's
not what triggered things.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.997
Yeah, which means we need to
find out who put that thing

06:37.030 --> 06:38.031
in his head now.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.667
Well, one step
ahead of you.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.103
So, there's only one lab
in all of Louisiana

06:43.136 --> 06:45.172
that's got pre-market approval
from the FDA

06:45.205 --> 06:46.807
to carry out
this type of research.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.041
BioResearch Institute
of New Orleans.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.643
PRIDE:
All right.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.045
You and I are gonna
pay them a visit.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.915
Chris, you and Gregorio find out
anything and everything you can

06:54.948 --> 06:56.149
about the institute.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.851
Oh, hey, wait, we're just
going to a lab, right?

06:57.885 --> 06:59.086
I don't need to bring my gun.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.821
Well, if you're sure that
the sailor's death

07:00.854 --> 07:02.089
was an accident.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.125
I'm gonna bring my gun.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.163
(trolley bell ringing)

07:15.202 --> 07:16.236
Dr. Yoon?

07:16.269 --> 07:17.738
These are federal agents.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.839
They're here to see you.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.474
They say it's important.
Uh...

07:20.508 --> 07:21.975
Anna.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.143
Dwayne.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.147
Oh, I've got this, thanks.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.484
It's been so long.
Too long.

07:30.518 --> 07:33.020
Thought you were still
at Naval Research.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.656
I was, that is until DoD
approved my project.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.924
Which, I'm assuming,

07:36.957 --> 07:38.492
is why you're here.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.927
I heard about Gabriel,

07:39.960 --> 07:42.129
we're trying to figure out
what happened.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.497
Uh...
Sorry.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.499
Forensic Agent Lund,
he works with me.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.934
Dr. Anna Yoon.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.101
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hi.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.803
Uh, where do I know
your name from?

07:51.204 --> 07:55.242
Anna used to be married
to Patton.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.144
SEBASTIAN:
Oh. Okay, yeah.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.980
That-- okay.
That Anna Yoon.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.182
Yup, one and the same.
Anyway...

08:02.215 --> 08:04.184
the implant is yours?

08:04.217 --> 08:06.086
The entire project is mine.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.689
Excuse me, Anna,
but, uh, Max thinks

08:08.722 --> 08:10.090
he might've found something.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.191
Okay, I'll be
right there, thanks.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.527
That's Dr. Lyons,

08:13.561 --> 08:15.095
he's chief surgeon
of the clinical trial.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.764
What do you think went wrong?

08:16.797 --> 08:18.098
That's the thing,
we don't know.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.601
Here, come, follow me.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.903
It's not exactly a new science.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.205
Deep brain stimulation
has been used for years

08:25.238 --> 08:26.774
without any problems.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.041
SEBASTIAN:
Well, except, and, you know,

08:28.075 --> 08:28.942
correct me if I'm wrong,

08:28.976 --> 08:30.878
that was before you were
implanting devices

08:30.911 --> 08:32.212
directly into
people's brains.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.281
Well, that's the point
of a clinical trial.

08:34.314 --> 08:37.785
In success, DBS
allows us to modulate

08:37.818 --> 08:40.888
overly aggressive
and violent behavior

08:40.921 --> 08:43.657
so that we can regulate and
calm the patient immediately.

08:43.691 --> 08:46.093
No disrespect,
but controlling people's brains

08:46.126 --> 08:48.228
from a computer...
We are not controlling,

08:48.261 --> 08:50.197
we are just monitoring;

08:50.230 --> 08:52.966
giving low-level stimuli
when necessary.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.968
This could be the biggest
breakthrough in mental health

08:55.002 --> 08:56.136
in years, Dwayne,

08:56.169 --> 08:57.104
especially for vets.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.239
Which is why the DoD
is so excited about it.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.273
MAX:
Dr. Yoon?

09:00.307 --> 09:02.242
I think we might
have a problem.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.111
Wait, is that Gabriel Ridley?

09:04.144 --> 09:05.746
MAX:
Yeah. Right before he died.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.581
That's impossible.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.949
Why, what is it?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.818
That's Ridley's
prefrontal cortex, right?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.753
The amygdala? It's where
aggressive behavior forms.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.788
Except it's intensified
instead of reduced.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.223
How did that happen?
Who did this, Max?

09:16.256 --> 09:18.659
Nobody from here. I...

09:18.692 --> 09:20.160
I think we've been hacked.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.998
All right!

09:25.032 --> 09:28.135
Triple P is in the house
and ready to rock.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.202
Aren't you supposed to
be resting?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.772
Oh, come on, I ain't a resting
kind of guy. Besides,

09:31.805 --> 09:34.241
Pride texted me, said he needed
me to trace down a hacker,

09:34.274 --> 09:35.809
so let's get the show
on the road.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.177
King happen to mention
the hacking involves

09:37.210 --> 09:38.245
one of your ex-wives?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.313
Oh, no, which one? Theresa?

09:40.347 --> 09:41.248
Uh, no.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.683
Jasmine?

09:42.716 --> 09:43.984
Afraid not.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.620
Anna?

09:47.888 --> 09:49.623
I'm out of here.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.225
Where you going?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.627
Nah, I ain't doing this.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.062
I know Pride didn't do me that.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.945
Check this out, BioResearch
turned down three competitors

10:11.979 --> 10:14.181
in the last year alone who
offered millions of dollars

10:14.214 --> 10:15.883
to buy the DBS project.

10:15.916 --> 10:16.950
Well, I'm not surprised,

10:16.984 --> 10:18.719
especially with all
the heavy hitters

10:18.752 --> 10:20.988
Sebastian said that are
interested in these wizard hats,

10:21.021 --> 10:22.422
or whatever it is
they call them.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.324
Cute name, scary technology.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.960
You got that right.
I mean, hacking into cars

10:26.994 --> 10:29.362
and computers is one thing,
but now brains?

10:29.396 --> 10:30.831
Hey, you think one
of the competitors

10:30.864 --> 10:32.132
didn't take no for an answer?

10:32.165 --> 10:33.967
Like, maybe they tried
to sabotage the project?

10:34.001 --> 10:37.004
Well, all the more reason for us
to try and trace the hack,

10:37.037 --> 10:39.206
see where it leads.
Problem is,

10:39.239 --> 10:41.975
we can deep-dive into company
records all we want, but...

10:42.009 --> 10:45.445
Without Patton's help,
we're grasping at straws.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.148
He's full of surprises,
isn't he?
Patton?

10:48.181 --> 10:50.684
He likes to keep
his private life private.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.985
Doesn't really talk
about it much.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.453
No, he doesn't talk
about it at all.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.188
I've been working here
for, what, over a year now.

10:55.222 --> 10:58.125
I've never heard about these
crazy stunts and ex-wives.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.293
I mean, that's
just... weird.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.930
Yeah.
It's understandable though.

11:02.963 --> 11:07.000
Tough times Patton went through
when he and Anna divorced.

11:07.034 --> 11:10.037
What's it been?
Uh, about six years now?

11:10.070 --> 11:13.240
Six years. That's when Patton
had his accident, right?

11:13.273 --> 11:14.742
Became paralyzed?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.276
Yeah, like I said, tough times.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.078
Fortunately for P,

11:18.111 --> 11:19.312
Pride gave him a fresh start.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.415
He joined NCIS
and he's never looked back.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.985
Yeah, well, never looking back
is one thing.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.420
Completely avoiding it
is a whole different deal.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.022
I mean, you saw how
fast he took off

11:29.056 --> 11:30.457
at just the mention
of Anna's name.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.392
Something's
still going on there.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.394
Well, hopefully King
can talk him through it,

11:34.427 --> 11:37.030
'cause we need Patton
to find this hacker.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.131
(beeping)

11:38.165 --> 11:39.166
Oh, good, you guys are there.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.034
I think I found something.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.270
Like what, a prop
from Back to the Future?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.005
Oh, right. I totally forgot.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.840
Although, actually,
you know, Doc Brown

11:46.874 --> 11:48.475
is sort of a personal hero
of mine.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.011
No, uh, Anna was about
to show me a virtual demo

11:51.044 --> 11:53.213
on how DBS works,
but, more importantly,

11:53.246 --> 11:55.215
I think I found a suspect.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.184
Lieutenant Krista Vreeland.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.753
She was a test subject here,
until a couple weeks ago,

11:59.787 --> 12:01.354
when she suddenly just
quit the trial.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.023
Anna said she was
pretty pissed, too.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.358
Did she say why?
Only that she thought

12:05.392 --> 12:07.094
the treatment
wasn't working for her.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.929
She started acting erratically
and then

12:08.962 --> 12:09.930
just refused to come back.

12:09.963 --> 12:10.964
You thinking maybe
a grudge?

12:10.998 --> 12:12.933
That sounds like a good
enough motive for me.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.067
We'll check it out.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.502
Hey, Sebastian, good work.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.070
Keep digging, but
don't fry your brain.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.339
Too late. Just kidding.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.142
I hope.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.818
(elevator bell dings)

12:33.821 --> 12:37.257
(Patton grunting softly)

12:37.290 --> 12:39.226
Not gonna lie.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.394
I wasn't sure you'd
even buzz me up.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.967
I figured if I didn't,
you'd keep dogging me.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.502
And I don't have time
for no lecture.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.808
Should you be lifting weights?

12:54.842 --> 12:57.344
I shouldn't be doing a lot of
things, according to most folks,

12:57.377 --> 13:00.848
but that's not gonna keep me
from doing what I do.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.218
I heard that you were...

13:05.252 --> 13:07.354
pretty upset when you
found out about Anna

13:07.387 --> 13:09.222
being involved in the case.

13:09.256 --> 13:12.225
You should have told me, so I
wouldn't be caught off guard.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.261
I didn't want to tell you
in a text.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.064
And I had no idea you'd
be in such a hurry

13:17.097 --> 13:18.398
to get back into
the office, either.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.969
You call, I'm there.
You know that.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.305
Patton,

13:25.338 --> 13:28.241
it's me, okay?

13:28.275 --> 13:30.143
Let's just talk about this.
Pride,

13:30.177 --> 13:33.380
I don't want to talk,
especially about her.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.215
Not now, not ever.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.417
And I'd think you'd know that
better than anybody!

13:37.450 --> 13:40.020
I do. But I also know that,
sooner or later,

13:40.053 --> 13:41.354
you're gonna need
to talk about it

13:41.388 --> 13:42.890
for your own sake.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.560
But that's not why I'm here.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.897
I need you on this case.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.499
A young boy lost
his father yesterday

13:52.532 --> 13:54.968
because somebody hacked
into Anna's project,

13:55.002 --> 13:57.270
and you're the only one
who can help find out

13:57.304 --> 13:59.139
who might have done it
and why.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.011
I'm sorry.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.645
I know this is hard for you.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.515
And I wouldn't be asking
if I had any other choice,

14:08.548 --> 14:11.351
but I don't think I can
do it without you.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.490
Sometimes it sucks
being so good at what I do.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.159
(Patton scoffs)

14:19.192 --> 14:21.861
Let me hit the shower.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.301
(indistinct chatter)

14:36.209 --> 14:37.344
Lieutenant Vreeland?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.611
Special Agents Lasalle

14:38.645 --> 14:40.380
and Gregorio.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.249
Will you stop the treadmill
for us, please?

14:42.282 --> 14:43.350
What's this about?

14:44.952 --> 14:47.020
(treadmill beeps)

14:47.054 --> 14:48.621
We're NCIS,
Lieutenant.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.057
When we say stop,
you stop.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.491
Besides,
he said "please."

14:51.524 --> 14:55.295
I'm sorry, it's just when
I get my adrenaline going...

14:55.328 --> 14:57.230
I take my exercise
very seriously, that's all.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.465
Yeah, well, we
take the murder

14:58.498 --> 15:00.600
of a sailor very seriously
as well.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.170
Murder? I don't
understand.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.305
Step over here, please.

15:07.274 --> 15:11.411
The DBS clinical trial--
why did you quit?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.180
How do you know
about that?

15:13.213 --> 15:15.415
LASALLE: Just answer
the question.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.384
Hey, look, we're not trying
to piss you off, Lieutenant.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.286
We just want some answers,
all right?

15:19.319 --> 15:20.387
So take a deep breath

15:20.420 --> 15:22.255
and tell us
what you know.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.292
I didn't want to quit.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.727
Frankly, DBS was the best thing
that ever happened to me

15:27.760 --> 15:30.030
after... this.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.634
Okay. So why did you
quit the trial?

15:34.667 --> 15:37.137
Because of Max.
He's a tech specialist

15:37.170 --> 15:38.571
at BioResearch.
We started dating,

15:38.605 --> 15:42.209
and then I broke it off,
and he didn't like that.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.411
Okay, so what does that
have to do with...

15:44.444 --> 15:46.046
Max started posting terrible
things about me online,

15:46.079 --> 15:47.347
making me look like a slut.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.648
He was trying
to piss me off.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.317
But not just with
the posts, either--

15:50.350 --> 15:52.019
with that thing that
they put in my head.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.387
What do you mean?
The implant?

15:54.421 --> 15:57.090
Are you saying that he used it
to somehow manipulate you?

15:57.124 --> 15:58.025
I know he was.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.360
I don't deny I have
anger issues. Okay?

16:00.393 --> 16:02.395
But nothing close to the rage
I felt every time

16:02.429 --> 16:03.363
he posted about me.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.697
I can't explain it,

16:04.731 --> 16:06.366
but it was like a switch
had gone off,

16:06.399 --> 16:07.700
and I could barely control it.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.736
That's why I quit
the program.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.304
And that's why I'm getting
this thing taken out

16:11.338 --> 16:13.306
as soon as possible.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.208
Okay.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.609
Well, you can go, for now.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.279
Thanks.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.613
(sighs)

16:22.249 --> 16:23.450
What do you think?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.418
Think she sounds more
like victim than suspect.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.420
Yeah. Which means
it's possible

16:27.454 --> 16:29.356
this Max guy's trying
to do the same thing

16:29.389 --> 16:31.524
to the lieutenant
he did to our sailor.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.426
Pretty good way
to sabotage the program.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.329
Plus, two deaths
are better than one.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.306
PRIDE: All right,
we're at the institute now.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.341
I'll talk to Max. Meanwhile,
you and Chris find out

16:48.375 --> 16:51.344
everything you can about him,
especially a motive.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.479
They might be onto something.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.780
Oh, good, then let's go.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.515
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, no.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.484
Hold on, hold on, you're
not going anywhere.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.386
Need proof on whoever's
doing the hacking.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.088
Only you can get it.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.323
Okay, all right, I'm good.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.226
You sure?
Absolutely. Let's do this.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.461
Okay, 'cause
here she comes.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.562
What? Where?

17:14.267 --> 17:16.436
God, she is beautiful.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.206
Damn her!

17:19.239 --> 17:20.407
Not about Anna,
it's about the case.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.442
Right, it's about the case.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.445
Hello, Patton.
How are you doing?

17:25.478 --> 17:26.813
I'm just here for the case.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.548
I-I mean,

17:28.581 --> 17:30.417
that's not what I mean.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.684
I mean, it is what I mean,

17:31.718 --> 17:35.522
but... (sighs)
Anna, you look great.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.523
Thank you.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.591
Um, where's
the mainframe?

17:38.625 --> 17:40.393
I got a hacker
to catch.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.862
Oh, uh, your associate,
Sebastian,

17:42.895 --> 17:45.098
is working on it upstairs
with Dr. Lyons.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.466
The elevator's
over there.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.567
Okay, well, that's
the way I'm headed.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.068
Excuse me.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.175
He's still mad at me,
isn't he?

17:55.208 --> 17:56.476
I don't know.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.511
And not for me to say.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.548
I think you just did.
Listen, we, um...

18:01.581 --> 18:02.782
might have a suspect.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.118
Krista?
Your tech specialist--

18:05.152 --> 18:06.453
Max Cahill.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.588
Max? Are you sure?

18:08.621 --> 18:10.190
Is he here?
Actually, no.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.591
He called in sick.

18:11.624 --> 18:15.495
Pride, I think you better
get up here fast.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.501
ANNA: What's wrong?
We're locked out.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.435
Wait a minute,
that's impossible.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.503
Well, we tried to identify

18:23.536 --> 18:24.804
the IP address of the hacker.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.306
We used data analytics...

18:26.339 --> 18:27.707
PATTON: That was
your first mistake.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.242
Probably what triggered
the reaction.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.443
What reaction?
PATTON: From the hacker.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.711
He knows we're
looking for him,

18:31.744 --> 18:34.247
so he sent a virus to infect
the entire system.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.782
And now we can't monitor
or control

18:35.815 --> 18:37.550
any of our test patients.
PRIDE: Hold on.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.553
How many more are there?
Five.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.454
PATTON:
Which potentially means

18:41.488 --> 18:44.524
five walking time bombs.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.709
Where are we
with Max Cahill?

19:02.742 --> 19:05.345
Uh, nowhere good,
I'm afraid.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.579
Put a BOLO out,

19:06.613 --> 19:08.448
but so far, there's
no sign of him.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.283
Did you try tracking
his car or his cell?

19:10.317 --> 19:11.851
Tapped into the GPS
on both.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.287
They're either inoperable
or they've both been disabled.

19:14.321 --> 19:17.224
Which could me Cahill
doesn't want to be found.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.725
Still, what's his motive?

19:18.758 --> 19:20.593
I get possibly one: to hurt

19:20.627 --> 19:24.264
the lieutenant for jilting him,
but why Gabriel Ridley?

19:24.297 --> 19:25.698
This might be why.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.834
Three weeks ago, Max supposedly

19:27.867 --> 19:29.769
got a research grant
for 100 grand

19:29.802 --> 19:32.439
from a group called
the Elmshorn Foundation.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.607
A grant for what?
That's the thing--
I can't find out.

19:34.641 --> 19:37.477
There is no record of the
organization even existing.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.878
You thinking maybe
it's a payoff

19:38.911 --> 19:41.614
by somebody wanting Max
to sabotage Anna's project?

19:41.648 --> 19:43.283
It would certainly
explain why he attacked

19:43.316 --> 19:44.784
both the lieutenant
and Ridley.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.853
And why he locked out
the institute,

19:46.886 --> 19:48.788
put all their other
patients at risk.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.690
One's still at risk
for sure.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.325
Just got off the phone
with Sebastian.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.461
He and Dr. Lyons
were able to contact

19:54.494 --> 19:56.696
every other test patient
and bring them in.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.765
All except for
Lieutenant Vreeland.

19:58.798 --> 19:59.966
They can't find her anywhere.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.269
No Max, no Krista--
that can't be good.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.403
PRIDE:
Keep looking for Max,

20:03.436 --> 20:04.604
and keep trying to figure out

20:04.637 --> 20:06.239
where that money
really came from.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.907
You're gonna try
and find Krista?

20:07.940 --> 20:10.410
Hopefully before Max does.
Come on, Christopher, let's go.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.979
Fill in Patton and Anna
when they get here.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.715
Uh, what do you mean?
Wait, th-they're coming here?

20:15.748 --> 20:18.751
Well, the institute computers
were compromised,

20:18.785 --> 20:20.753
so Patton wants to try
and take back control

20:20.787 --> 20:21.621
with his own gear.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.657
With Anna? Like,
are they getting along?

20:26.326 --> 20:28.295
Too soon to tell.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.529
GREGORIO:
Okay.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.531
I don't need that drama.
I'm busy.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.899
(horn honks, tires screeching)

20:32.932 --> 20:35.502
ANNA: You're gonna get us
both killed.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.537
Will you please slow down?

20:37.570 --> 20:38.638
(horn honking)
ANNA: Watch out!

20:38.671 --> 20:41.441
For God sakes, please.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.311
Not to worry, Triple P
is completely in control.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.912
I see you're still referring
to yourself in third person

20:45.945 --> 20:47.046
with that stupid nickname.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.449
Wait, hold on, you used to
like that stupid nickname.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.351
You said it was
one of my lovable quirks.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.719
I never said that.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.554
You must be confusing me
with someone else.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.589
I ain't been with
nobody else since you.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.690
You just not remembering right.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.760
I remember you drive
like a maniac.

21:00.793 --> 21:01.794
What happened to your arm?

21:02.795 --> 21:04.297
Oh, you don't even want to know.

21:04.331 --> 21:05.365
(tires screeching)

21:05.398 --> 21:07.334
Patton!

21:08.968 --> 21:10.737
We're here.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.639
(engine turns off)

21:12.672 --> 21:15.041
Oh, boy.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.843
MARLENE:
Hey, Patton!

21:17.944 --> 21:19.846
Hey, Marlene.
Hey.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.714
I was passing by.
I knew you worked here,

21:21.748 --> 21:23.583
so I thought
I'd drop your gear off.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.651
Um...

21:25.718 --> 21:27.754
How's the arm?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.457
Good enough to go paragliding
again soon, I hope.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.759
Paragliding? Really?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.594
Is that how you hurt your arm?

21:34.627 --> 21:35.895
Unbelievable.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.565
Ex-wife, enough said.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.367
(clears throat)

21:41.734 --> 21:43.503
Thank you.
Oh, hey.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.704
You must be Dr. Yoon.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.706
I'm Agent Gregorio, Tammy.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.107
Anna, nice to meet you.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.776
You, too.
Where's Patton?

21:49.809 --> 21:51.478
Well, uh...
Follow me.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.680
Let's get to work.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.749
No need to explain.
I've got an ex, too.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.518
Yeah? Any tips?
Yeah.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.753
Well, I just arrested mine
and threw his sorry ass in jail,

22:00.787 --> 22:02.589
so probably not.
(chuckles)

22:04.991 --> 22:07.760
Is he, uh, doing okay?

22:07.794 --> 22:09.729
Patton?
Are you kidding?

22:09.762 --> 22:11.431
Yeah, he's great.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.566
Like one big happy family.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.968
I'm so glad to hear that.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.404
Yeah.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.806
So his office is that way?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.708
Straight through the courtyard,
can't miss it.

22:21.741 --> 22:22.742
Thanks.

22:22.775 --> 22:25.578
Wish me luck.
(chuckles)

22:38.124 --> 22:41.093
Lieutenant Vreeland,
federal agents.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.595
(quietly):
Chris, take the back.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.857
Clear.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.925
LASALLE: Looks like the place
has been ransacked.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.093
More like trashed
than ransacked.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.662
Too many broken things.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.029
Yeah, somebody had to be
pretty out of control

23:17.063 --> 23:18.831
to do this much damage.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.467
Think it has to do
with her implant?

23:20.500 --> 23:23.102
Fits the profile, unfortunately.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.037
Especially if somebody's
trying to do to her

23:25.071 --> 23:26.172
what they did to Ridley.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.841
LASALLE:
Man, I don't get it.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.977
I don't care how much so-called
potential this thing has,

23:31.010 --> 23:32.845
messing with people's minds
is just wrong.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.847
That's what they said
about heart transplants

23:34.881 --> 23:36.215
when they came out;

23:36.248 --> 23:39.118
now, look at all the folks
it's helped.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.488
Progress isn't
always pretty.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.756
Yeah, well, not pretty's
one thing,

23:43.790 --> 23:45.191
(keys rattle)
but dangerous is another.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.761
King, might be her cell.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.063
Looks like she got a text
from Max an hour ago.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.466
"Please let me apologize."

23:53.500 --> 23:54.634
Well, it doesn't exactly
sound like

23:54.667 --> 23:55.835
somebody trying to hurt her.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.005
LASALLE:
Doesn't mean the lieutenant

23:59.038 --> 24:00.439
doesn't want to hurt him,
though.

24:02.709 --> 24:03.910
Maybe Max's

24:03.943 --> 24:06.078
cyberbullying went too far
for her.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.515
Well, it doesn't make sense.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.950
If Max is behind all this,

24:10.983 --> 24:12.852
why taunt her,

24:12.885 --> 24:14.921
then trigger the DBS

24:14.954 --> 24:16.756
to make her violent,
and then ask to meet?

24:16.789 --> 24:17.990
LASALLE:
Yeah, putting himself

24:18.024 --> 24:19.926
in harm's way,
it doesn't add up.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.094
Either way, we got to find her
and stop her

24:22.128 --> 24:24.230
before it's too late.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.933
Man, I done tried everything.

24:26.966 --> 24:27.967
Whoever locked you out
the project,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.936
they know what they're doing.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.539
Well, it has to be Max, he's the
one who programmed the software.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.073
Got to be a compiler backdoor.

24:34.106 --> 24:37.109
He has to have a remote way in
if he's trying to hurt people.

24:37.143 --> 24:40.046
You ever change
your default password?

24:40.079 --> 24:41.648
I assume you change

24:41.681 --> 24:43.249
your passwords regularly
like I taught you to.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.718
Yeah, just not every week.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.787
Wait, I never said
"every week."

24:47.820 --> 24:50.056
Maybe every other week.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.892
Your first password,
do you even remember it?

24:52.925 --> 24:55.027
"Claudia1219."

24:55.061 --> 24:57.029
Who's that? I don't remember
no Claudia being in your family.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.798
Claudia's my daughter.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.901
"12/19" is her birthday.

25:01.934 --> 25:02.969
Whoa.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.238
Okay.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.540
I didn't know.

25:07.574 --> 25:08.975
I mean, you know,

25:09.008 --> 25:10.276
'cause you're not
wearing a ring.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.612
Yeah, well, I'm not married.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.080
Not anymore, anyway.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.817
I hope I'm a better mother
than I was a wife.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.085
True that.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.054
What is that supposed to mean?

25:22.088 --> 25:23.890
Nothing, never mind.
No, you said it,

25:23.923 --> 25:25.257
I want to know what
you meant by that.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.093
It didn't mean anything.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.995
Fine, just bury your head in
the sand like you always do.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.297
Wait, whoa, say what?
Or, better yet,
why don't you go skydiving,

25:31.330 --> 25:32.799
or-or paragliding,

25:32.832 --> 25:35.267
or why don't you race your boat
too damn fast?

25:35.301 --> 25:37.970
See? That's cold. I thought
we didn't want to go there.

25:38.004 --> 25:40.239
No, y don't want to go there.
You never want to go there.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.641
You just want to
keep blaming me

25:41.674 --> 25:43.109
'cause it's easier
than looking at yourself

25:43.142 --> 25:44.977
in the mirror.
I don't want to talk about it!

25:45.011 --> 25:47.046
You never want to talk about it.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.748
That's the problem!

25:48.781 --> 25:50.082
That's our problem.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.719
You never wanted to
talk about anything.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.887
You just want to keep
running, and denying,

25:54.921 --> 25:56.823
and blaming everything on me,

25:56.856 --> 25:58.024
but it's not fair.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.692
I'm not the one
who put you in the chair,

25:59.726 --> 26:00.960
you did.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.770
Sorry to interrupt.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.605
Uh, but Pride needs you, Patton.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.684
PRIDE: Patton, you get into
the DBS program yet?

26:24.717 --> 26:25.885
I'm still trying.

26:25.918 --> 26:26.919
Running out of time here.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.087
Well, I would've been in by now

26:28.120 --> 26:29.922
if I didn't have these
few distractions.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.057
(Patton typing)

26:31.090 --> 26:32.091
I'm in. What do you need?

26:32.124 --> 26:33.726
I need you to shut it down.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.762
Krista's about to meet Max
at a coffee shop

26:35.795 --> 26:36.996
in the Quarter,
and we have to get to her

26:37.029 --> 26:38.097
before she does
something she regrets.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.732
Krista.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.101
Somebody's triggering her limbic
system, it's off the charts.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.704
What does that mean?
It means you have to
shut it down, fast!

26:44.737 --> 26:47.173
Or she's gonna hurt somebody.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.843
(siren wailing)

26:52.044 --> 26:54.246
(siren chirps, stops)

26:54.280 --> 26:56.783
(woman screaming)

26:56.816 --> 26:58.918
Get out of the way!
Out of the way!

27:00.186 --> 27:01.754
NCIS, don't move.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.194
It's Max.

27:11.197 --> 27:12.832
What have I done?

27:31.117 --> 27:33.319
(indistinct radio chatter)

27:34.153 --> 27:35.755
LASALLE:
How is she?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.857
Still doesn't remember
what happened.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.826
Doesn't even remember
coming here to meet Max

27:39.859 --> 27:40.693
in the first place.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.428
(siren chirps)
How is that possible?

27:42.461 --> 27:44.764
Blackout, maybe,
blinded by rage.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.733
Krista says it's
happened before.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.868
Well, it doesn't look
good for her, King.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.903
It's gonna be hard to prove
that someone triggered her

27:50.937 --> 27:52.371
to be violent,
especially if that somebody

27:52.404 --> 27:53.773
turns out to be
the victim.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.843
Unless it wasn't Max
who triggered her.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.811
Like you said before,
doesn't add up.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.079
It's too neat.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.447
Max taunted her,

28:01.480 --> 28:04.116
I know, but if all he was
really trying to do

28:04.150 --> 28:06.919
was sabotage Anna's project...

28:06.953 --> 28:08.755
You think someone's
trying to set them both up?

28:08.788 --> 28:11.157
Hoping to make Max
look like the fall guy

28:11.190 --> 28:13.092
so we'd stop
investigating?

28:13.125 --> 28:15.928
I think we need to
find that out.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.398
Blunt force trauma.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.769
I'd say at least three or four
strikes and powerful ones, too.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.303
I found skull fragments

28:24.336 --> 28:26.438
deep in the corpus callosum
of his brain.

28:26.472 --> 28:27.974
That sounds pretty violent.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.408
Very. And, yes,

28:29.441 --> 28:32.078
overstimulating anybody's
limbic region,

28:32.111 --> 28:33.846
even artificially,

28:33.880 --> 28:35.314
could make someone
strong enough to do this.

28:35.347 --> 28:36.783
LASALLE:
Doesn't exactly let

28:36.816 --> 28:38.150
Lieutenant Vreeland
off the hook, does it?

28:38.184 --> 28:39.986
No, but this might.

28:40.019 --> 28:42.388
I just checked the murder weapon
for prints, didn't find any.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.090
You mean you didn't find
the lieutenant's?

28:44.123 --> 28:46.859
No, I mean I didn't find
anyone's prints. Nada, nothing.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.061
There's clearly blood where
there should be fingerprints,

28:49.095 --> 28:50.863
but instead of loops and whorls,
all I found

28:50.897 --> 28:52.098
was trace evidence of latex.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.332
Killer was wearing gloves.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.201
But Krista wasn't.
SEBASTIAN: Right, plus,

28:55.234 --> 28:57.069
the size and shape
of the blood spatter

28:57.103 --> 28:59.371
on the lieutenant's clothes
doesn't match the downward force

28:59.405 --> 29:01.941
she would've had to use
to hit Max with.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.409
So you are certain
she's not the killer.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.877
100%.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.813
That means Dwayne was right,

29:06.846 --> 29:09.181
Lieutenant Vreeland
was being set up.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.917
Which means so is Max.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.452
Question is: by who?

29:13.485 --> 29:16.122
SEBASTIAN: Hopefully
Patton's found something.

29:31.570 --> 29:32.972
Hey.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.306
You okay?

29:34.340 --> 29:35.875
Yeah, yeah, of course.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.443
I'm still trying to
backtrace the hacker.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.846
So far, looks like
all roads lead to Max.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.113
Doesn't mean somebody didn't
set him up, though, right?

29:41.147 --> 29:42.448
Like Pride thinks?

29:42.481 --> 29:43.916
Yeah, well, it's
a pretty elaborate setup

29:43.950 --> 29:45.151
if somebody did.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.419
Expensive, too,
if that same someone

29:47.453 --> 29:48.988
planted 100 grand
in Max's bank account

29:49.021 --> 29:50.957
to make it look even worse
for him.
Yeah.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.424
You know what?
I'm gonna see if I can trace it.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.393
No, I got it.
Don't worry, it's no problem.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.028
Patton?

29:56.062 --> 29:57.429
Can you stop?

29:59.465 --> 30:01.100
I'm not gonna pretend
that I didn't hear

30:01.133 --> 30:03.069
what you and Anna
were arguing about.

30:03.102 --> 30:06.038
Obviously,
she's pretty pissed at me.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.106
I can't say I blame her.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.942
No, but you can
talk to her.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.443
Come on, you know
how long it took

30:11.477 --> 30:14.446
before I finally faced my ex,

30:14.480 --> 30:17.349
figured out what I'd been
running from all those years.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.285
Only wish I'd done it sooner.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.587
Gregorio,
it's easier said than done.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.422
No, I know, baby,
but I'm telling you,

30:23.455 --> 30:25.091
now that I'm on
the other side of it,

30:25.124 --> 30:28.060
I feel... free.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.898
And it might be freeing
for Anna, too.

30:36.635 --> 30:39.605
How much did you
overhear anyway?
Oh, not a lot.

30:39.638 --> 30:42.975
Just enough to know that I don't
want you to get hurt anymore.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.946
And I'm not just
talking about your arm.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.584
I got Max, you
go get Anna.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.422
Get out of here.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.611
Don't be scared.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.047
(gasps, sighs)

31:21.080 --> 31:23.215
Patton...
I'm sorry.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.117
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.252
That happens a lot.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.487
These tires are not
as noisy as footsteps.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.556
What are you doing here?

31:30.589 --> 31:33.225
I'm not exactly sure.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.161
I thought we should talk.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.629
Now is not a good time.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.465
Why not? I mean...

31:39.498 --> 31:40.632
What are you doing?

31:40.666 --> 31:42.301
Packing up.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.203
Dr. Lyons and I decided

31:44.236 --> 31:47.239
to shut down
the project for good.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.041
What? I mean,

31:49.075 --> 31:50.642
if I find out
who sabotaged you...

31:50.676 --> 31:52.644
It doesn't matter.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.313
Even if you catch
whoever did this,

31:54.346 --> 31:56.949
they still violated every
single safety protocol

31:56.983 --> 31:59.318
that we had.

31:59.351 --> 32:02.421
People got killed.

32:02.454 --> 32:06.158
And this project was supposed
to help people, not hurt them.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.129
I'm sorry, Anna.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.230
It's not your fault.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.432
Yes, actually, it is.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.404
You were right when you said
I've been blaming you,

32:18.437 --> 32:20.039
and I have been all along.

32:20.072 --> 32:23.142
And... I'm wrong for that.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.980
I guess I just didn't want
to admit it.

32:30.182 --> 32:34.053
I shouldn't have said the things
that I said that night.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.587
Yeah, you should have.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.090
I just didn't want to hear it.

32:40.192 --> 32:43.629
So I did what I always do
when I don't want to deal--

32:43.662 --> 32:46.032
I ran.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.534
I had way too much
to drink,

32:48.567 --> 32:51.170
I drove that stupid boat
too fast

32:51.203 --> 32:52.471
trying to get away
from it all,

32:52.504 --> 32:54.173
and... here I am.

32:54.206 --> 32:57.176
Here we are.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.047
Patton...

33:01.080 --> 33:02.281
It's okay, Anna.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.617
It-- no, it really is.
I'm good.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.220
My life is good.

33:08.254 --> 33:11.057
Do you know...

33:11.090 --> 33:15.194
how many times I've
relived that night?

33:15.227 --> 33:19.198
Thinking if only we
had never fought...

33:19.231 --> 33:20.466
No, Anna.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.069
As far as I'm concerned,

33:23.102 --> 33:25.137
I'm lucky to even
still be alive

33:25.171 --> 33:27.139
to do what I do--

33:27.173 --> 33:29.208
help people.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.043
Like you always tried to do.

33:32.411 --> 33:35.681
I was just a boy
when my mother died.

33:35.714 --> 33:39.318
I didn't want to deal
with that.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.453
I didn't know how.

33:41.487 --> 33:44.790
All you ever did was
tell me I needed to.

33:44.823 --> 33:47.126
Now I get it.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.198
Better late than never, huh?

33:52.231 --> 33:55.201
Does that mean no
more paragliding?

33:55.234 --> 33:56.835
Hey, girl, come on.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.804
Don't go getting greedy now.
(chuckles)

33:58.837 --> 34:00.572
Just take the apology,
will you?

34:00.606 --> 34:02.141
(laughing)

34:08.180 --> 34:10.316
I'm sorry for everything, Anna.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.784
I truly am.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.422
For blaming you,

34:16.455 --> 34:19.258
for everything
I put you through,

34:19.291 --> 34:21.393
for what happened to us...

34:23.395 --> 34:25.664
All of it.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.068
Thank you.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.273
Now, get out of my way.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.175
I got to find out
who's behind this

34:36.208 --> 34:37.176
and save your project,
(Anna laughing)

34:37.209 --> 34:39.311
whether you like it or not.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.185
I think I know where

34:46.218 --> 34:48.154
Max's research grant
supposedly came from.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.588
Well, I hope it leads
to a suspect,

34:49.621 --> 34:51.190
'cause we don't have jack.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.225
So, when I couldn't find
anything on the foundation,

34:53.259 --> 34:56.128
I did a forensic track on
where the money came from.

34:56.162 --> 34:57.529
Ran into nothing but firewalls.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.298
The same ones Patton
kept running into

34:59.331 --> 35:01.600
when he was looking
for the hacker.
Well, it makes sense.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.602
Probably the same person
behind both.
Exactly.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.338
Which means probably
the same digital M.O.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.340
So I started looking
for some connection

35:08.374 --> 35:09.741
to Anna's project files.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.344
I found about 100,000 of them.
So, what,

35:12.378 --> 35:13.712
you're saying the
money that ended up

35:13.745 --> 35:15.747
in Max's account
came from Anna?

35:15.781 --> 35:17.616
Or from her partner,
Dr. Lyons?

35:17.649 --> 35:20.252
Got to be Dr. Lyons.
LASALLE: Well, why would he want

35:20.286 --> 35:21.620
to sabotage
their own project?

35:21.653 --> 35:24.756
Unless he was trying to
get it away from Anna

35:24.790 --> 35:27.359
to sell it for the millions
that she turned down.

35:27.393 --> 35:29.195
Well, if that's true,
and Lyons figures out

35:29.228 --> 35:30.296
we know he set Max up...

35:30.329 --> 35:32.231
Anna could be in danger.
Where is she?

35:32.264 --> 35:33.765
With Patton, at the institute.

35:33.799 --> 35:37.303
PRIDE: All right, get Patton
on the phone. Let's go.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.571
Now that I know the back door
that they used,

35:39.605 --> 35:41.873
I should be able to
backtrace the IP address

35:41.907 --> 35:43.809
from your project's
mainframe.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.411
(phone ringing)

35:45.444 --> 35:46.812
PRIDE: Patton...
Hello?

35:46.845 --> 35:48.380
Not now, Pride.
I'm hot on the trail of...

35:48.414 --> 35:49.515
PRIDE:
Listen to me, Patton.

35:49.548 --> 35:50.849
You're in danger.

35:50.882 --> 35:52.384
(Anna gasps)

35:52.418 --> 35:53.719
PRIDE: What's happening?
Nothing good.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.521
(glass shatters)
ANNA: What was that?

35:55.554 --> 35:57.323
I don't know, stay here.

36:02.561 --> 36:03.795
(gunshots)
PATTON: Get back!

36:05.897 --> 36:07.799
(Anna yells)

36:19.845 --> 36:20.879
(siren wailing)
Still can't get through

36:20.912 --> 36:22.214
to Patton's cell.

36:22.248 --> 36:23.749
No answer at the institute,
either.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.851
GREGORIO: He'd obviously pick up
if he wasn't in trouble.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.453
Find out how close NOPD is.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.322
(gunshots)

36:34.260 --> 36:36.762
(gas hissing)

36:38.564 --> 36:39.798
(whispering):
Are you okay?

36:39.831 --> 36:41.767
No, I'm not okay.
I'm scared.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.769
In all fairness,
you scare easily.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.337
Not funny.

36:45.371 --> 36:48.006
I don't understand.
How does killing us

36:48.039 --> 36:49.675
help Caleb get away with this?

36:49.708 --> 36:50.876
(gas hissing)
What's that sound?

36:50.909 --> 36:53.245
Stay here.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.513
Where are you going?

36:54.546 --> 36:56.582
Patton.

36:56.615 --> 36:57.983
(hissing continues)

37:05.824 --> 37:08.360
(whispering): I think he's
trying to blow up the laboratory

37:08.394 --> 37:10.429
to make it look like
we died in an accident.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.898
You know, I got an idea.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.232
Get the orange strap.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.838
(gas hissing)

37:19.871 --> 37:20.972
Here.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.874
Put it around my waist.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.843
What are you about to do?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.578
Strap in and do something
that you've been trying

37:26.612 --> 37:29.948
to stop me from doing for years.
What?

37:32.451 --> 37:35.354
Now, give me a push
with everything you got.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.289
Are you crazy?
You want to die?

37:44.630 --> 37:46.532
(yelling)

37:51.403 --> 37:52.404
Patton!

37:58.977 --> 38:01.046
ANNA: No!
(gunshot)

38:02.881 --> 38:04.850
Patton, you okay?

38:04.883 --> 38:07.386
Turn them damn valves off,
I will be.

38:08.587 --> 38:09.721
(gasps)

38:11.056 --> 38:12.858
(hissing stops)

38:14.426 --> 38:15.661
GREGORIO:
You're not hurt?

38:15.694 --> 38:16.895
Nah, nothing broken.
I'm good.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.867
Guess all that paragliding
paid off.

38:21.900 --> 38:22.968
Stuck the landing.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.870
PATTON:
Well, sort of.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.872
(chuckling)

38:26.905 --> 38:28.974
You really are crazy,
you know that?

38:29.007 --> 38:31.510
PRIDE:
Yeah, well...

38:31.543 --> 38:35.381
we've, uh, known that
a long, long time.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.948
PATTON:
Uh-huh. That's right.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.551
I ain't crazy, I'm colorful.

38:39.585 --> 38:42.388
Triple P to the rescue.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.989
(all laughing)

38:44.022 --> 38:48.059
(Pride groans playfully)

39:10.949 --> 39:13.852
(doorbell chiming)
Hmm?

39:24.530 --> 39:26.965
(sighs)

39:26.998 --> 39:29.000
(elevator bell dings)

39:34.473 --> 39:35.607
You were thinking about
pretending

39:35.641 --> 39:36.942
you weren't home, weren't you?

39:36.975 --> 39:39.445
Well, I thought about it,

39:39.478 --> 39:42.180
but then I remembered my
van was parked out front.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.450
Knew I didn't have a chance.
(laughs)

39:44.483 --> 39:46.652
Want a drink?
A drink?

39:46.685 --> 39:48.520
It's a little early,
isn't it?

39:48.554 --> 39:50.889
(scoffs) This is
New Orleans, baby.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.891
No, thanks, I'm fine.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.627
I just thought I'd stop
by on my way to work.

39:55.661 --> 39:59.498
I wanted to let you know
that I'm taking your advice.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.000
I'm gonna try to
salvage my project.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.135
All right.
Now you're talking, Anna.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.137
Good for you.

40:06.171 --> 40:08.540
And I think I can talk Krista
into sticking with it, too,

40:08.574 --> 40:10.576
now that the charges
have been dropped.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.043
See, it's all working out.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.712
It is working out.

40:15.246 --> 40:19.184
I'm glad we finally had
that talk, Patton.

40:19.217 --> 40:22.954
I just wish it could have
happened six years sooner.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.992
I wasn't much
of a talker back then.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.127
Or a listener.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.064
Good thing, though,

40:33.098 --> 40:34.933
or you wouldn't have Claudia.

40:34.966 --> 40:37.503
And you wouldn't have
all these people

40:37.536 --> 40:40.171
who obviously care
a lot about you, too.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.081
(motor buzzing)

40:50.115 --> 40:52.150
Yeah!

40:56.287 --> 40:59.090
Hey, Patton.
How are you?

40:59.124 --> 41:01.993
Living the dream, Marlene.
Living the dream.

41:02.027 --> 41:04.162
You want to go up?
Hell yeah.

41:04.195 --> 41:07.666
But, I have
a question first.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.035
I was wondering if
maybe you'd like

41:10.068 --> 41:11.903
to go out to dinner
with me sometime.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.708
I'd like that.

41:16.742 --> 41:18.176
All right.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.579
That makes two of us.
(chuckles)

41:22.113 --> 41:23.515
But first,

41:23.549 --> 41:24.983
strap me in, Marlene.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.018
'Cause Triple P
is ready to fly.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.721
(both chuckling)
