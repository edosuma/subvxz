00:03.477 --> 00:05.639
Mr. Singer.
I believe you know Sheriff Mills.

00:08.684 --> 00:10.675
It's his soul. It's gone.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.986
Sam. I'm gonna put up a barrier.

00:14.423 --> 00:16.789
Don't scratch the wall.

00:21.830 --> 00:23.730
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.

00:24.066 --> 00:27.399
Hi, Sam.
I think this is my best torture yet.

00:27.569 --> 00:31.369
You never left, Sam.
You're still in the cage with me.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.501
No. This can't be happening.

00:36.912 --> 00:40.040
Your vessel is melting.
You're going to explode.

00:40.215 --> 00:43.412
There are things much older than souls
in purgatory...

00:43.585 --> 00:45.075
...and you gulped those in too.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.414
- What older things?
- The Leviathans.

00:47.823 --> 00:49.848
- I can't hold them back.
- Hold who back?

00:50.025 --> 00:51.083
Leviathan!

00:51.259 --> 00:52.351
Cass?

00:52.527 --> 00:55.052
Cass is... Hmm, he's gone.

01:00.435 --> 01:04.370
Now, this is going to be so much fun.

01:23.725 --> 01:25.420
Bobby?

01:33.669 --> 01:36.297
How many of you ass-clowns
are in there?

01:36.471 --> 01:38.029
Hundred?

01:38.507 --> 01:39.667
More?

01:47.582 --> 01:49.709
Your vessel is gonna explode, ain't it?

01:49.885 --> 01:51.546
Wouldn't do anything too strenuous.

01:51.720 --> 01:55.486
In fact, I'd call it a day,
head on home, huh?

01:56.158 --> 01:58.991
We'll be back for you.

02:15.243 --> 02:19.043
Well, this is a new one.

02:33.261 --> 02:35.058
You're not real.

02:35.230 --> 02:37.095
Right.

02:37.265 --> 02:40.393
You think this fruit bat fever dream
is reality?

02:40.569 --> 02:45.302
<i>You come back, I'm sorry, with no soul,
like some peppy American Psycho...</i>

02:45.507 --> 02:48.442
...till Saint Dean
glues you back together again...

02:48.610 --> 02:51.943
...by buying you some magic amnesia?

02:56.284 --> 02:58.752
You're real. I'm very real.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.650
Everything between is
what we call set dressing.

03:01.823 --> 03:03.916
- No.
- You're still in my cell.

03:04.092 --> 03:06.583
You're my bunkmate, buddy.

03:06.895 --> 03:10.626
You're my little bitch
in every sense of the term.

03:10.799 --> 03:13.495
Sam? Sam?

03:13.668 --> 03:16.068
Sam. You hearing me?

03:19.241 --> 03:21.732
Look at me. Hey.
All right, we gotta button this up.

03:23.145 --> 03:25.477
Come on. Let's get out of here.

03:25.647 --> 03:27.308
- Okay.
- Come on.

04:20.502 --> 04:22.732
Oh, hell.

04:38.353 --> 04:39.615
Damn it.

04:41.523 --> 04:42.683
You said it.

04:42.858 --> 04:45.850
Those whatever-you-call-thems...

04:46.027 --> 04:47.153
Leviathan.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.191
Right.

04:51.132 --> 04:53.191
If they're in the pipes...

04:53.368 --> 04:55.529
...they got themselves a highway
to anywhere.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.634
Awesome.

05:17.792 --> 05:19.020
Okay.

05:20.562 --> 05:22.587
So he's gone.

05:22.964 --> 05:26.263
Yup. Rest in peace.

05:26.434 --> 05:28.732
If that's in the cards.

05:30.472 --> 05:32.463
Dumb son of a bitch.

05:36.077 --> 05:38.875
Well, he was friends with us,
wasn't he?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.777
Can't get much dumber than that.

05:41.950 --> 05:45.681
Come on. Those things
will be coming up for air soon.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.264
<i>Mississippi moon
Won't you keep on shinin' on me</i>

06:36.438 --> 06:37.928
<i>Yeah, keep on shinin' your light</i>

06:40.141 --> 06:42.041
<i>Gonna make everything</i>

06:42.243 --> 06:45.872
<i>Pretty mama
Gonna make everything all right</i>

07:02.797 --> 07:04.890
Hey, wake up, sunshine.

07:05.066 --> 07:06.727
Up and at them, Atom Man.

07:06.901 --> 07:08.391
Sammy.

07:08.570 --> 07:11.038
- Sammy.
- Sammy. Hey, whoa.

07:12.774 --> 07:16.369
That's 12 hours straight.
I'm calling that rested. Here, hydrate.

07:17.178 --> 07:20.147
And, uh, protein-ate.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.543
Ahem, breakfast in bed.

07:24.719 --> 07:27.187
Don't get used to it.
Let me see that hand.

07:27.355 --> 07:29.482
Oh, he wants to hold your little hand.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.215
How sweet.

07:37.599 --> 07:39.499
Ah, you'll live.

07:44.305 --> 07:45.397
Here.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.172
- Ooh!
- All right, take it easy.

07:49.411 --> 07:51.276
So ooze invasion. Any leads?

07:51.446 --> 07:53.004
I got all my feelers out.

07:53.615 --> 07:56.083
Whatever they're up to...

07:56.718 --> 08:00.552
...it ain't about going Mothra
down Main Street.

08:00.722 --> 08:01.746
They'll turn up.

08:03.124 --> 08:05.115
They seemed eager
to stretch their legs, you know?

08:05.326 --> 08:09.729
Hmm. Yeah, well,
now on to our other big problem.

08:10.231 --> 08:12.426
How are you doing?
And do not say okay.

08:13.468 --> 08:15.299
- I'm not okay.
- You think?

08:15.470 --> 08:16.767
Hey, go a little easy.

08:16.938 --> 08:18.701
There's nothing easy about it, Bobby.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.864
We acted like
he had things under control.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.270
I get it.

08:22.444 --> 08:25.572
I'm sorry. Look, I didn't exactly
wanna crack up, you know?

08:25.747 --> 08:27.977
What the hell happened back there?

08:30.351 --> 08:32.717
Well,
it's not just the flashbacks anymore.

08:32.886 --> 08:34.616
Well, then what?

08:34.789 --> 08:36.416
It's more like...

08:37.859 --> 08:40.054
...I'm seeing through the cracks.

08:40.794 --> 08:42.227
What does that mean?

08:42.397 --> 08:45.924
It means I'm having a difficult time
figuring out what's real.

08:46.101 --> 08:47.466
Hallucinations?

08:48.002 --> 08:49.094
For starters.

08:49.270 --> 08:52.797
For starters, if you're tripping
hell's bells, why would you hide that?

08:52.974 --> 08:56.603
I wasn't hiding it, Dean.
I was just not talking about it.

08:56.778 --> 08:58.678
You two had enough going on
as it was.

08:58.880 --> 09:05.012
Look, I just figured try to hold on to
the safety bar and ride it out, you know?

09:05.887 --> 09:08.253
But it's getting more specific.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.516
As in specifically what?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.791
What the hell, Sam?

09:16.965 --> 09:18.432
I told you.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.462
No, but seriously,
how do you argue with that?

09:21.636 --> 09:23.695
I know. It's a problem.

09:24.973 --> 09:26.031
No, wait. I got it.

09:27.308 --> 09:29.367
Why would the devil
holodeck you a new life?

09:29.544 --> 09:31.774
He could just kick your ass
all over the cage.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.607
Because, as he puts it:

09:33.781 --> 09:36.045
You can't torture
someone who has nothing...

09:36.217 --> 09:37.275
...for you to take away.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.147
Very good, Sam.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.280
Okay, fine.

09:41.456 --> 09:45.153
But this Malibu dream mansion
that he makes for you to take away...

09:45.326 --> 09:47.487
...is this post-apocalyptic mess?

09:47.662 --> 09:49.459
It had to be a mess, Sam...

09:49.831 --> 09:52.527
...or you wouldn't believe
it was your life.

10:00.341 --> 10:02.070
Wait, are you seeing him right now?

10:05.747 --> 10:08.341
You know that he's not real, right?

10:13.888 --> 10:16.049
He says the same thing about you.

10:21.462 --> 10:23.521
I'm going back to work.

10:29.037 --> 10:30.937
<i>Scientists have no explanation...</i>

10:31.105 --> 10:34.404
<i>...for what astronomers describe
as a surprise eclipse.</i>

10:34.576 --> 10:37.272
<i>- Instead of car insurance...
- Time to announce...</i>

10:37.478 --> 10:38.604
<i>We know you're hungry.</i>

10:38.780 --> 10:41.180
<i>Indulge yourself at
Biggerson's Homemade Pie Bar.</i>

10:41.349 --> 10:43.340
<i>It's like a salad bar, but with pie.</i>

10:43.885 --> 10:45.944
<i>Next week on Dr. Sexy, MD:</i>

10:46.120 --> 10:49.612
<i>Dr. Cheyenne Meganopolis
makes a shocking return.</i>

10:49.791 --> 10:50.917
<i>I'm sorry, doctor.</i>

10:51.092 --> 10:54.528
<i>I forgot being head surgeon means
you cut into whatever body you want...</i>

10:54.696 --> 10:56.857
<i>...and take out
whatever organ pleases you...</i>

10:57.031 --> 10:58.931
<i>...without any paperwork whatsoever.</i>

10:59.100 --> 11:02.695
<i>Well, doctor,
I'm sorry you're so forgetful.</i>

11:08.776 --> 11:12.303
Well, at least he's not curled up
under the sink.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.945
Yeah, no. He's just sitting there silently
field-stripping his weapon.

11:27.762 --> 11:28.956
What are you doing?

11:29.130 --> 11:31.963
Turning on his GPS in case he decides
to fly the cuckoo's nest.

11:35.637 --> 11:37.298
And you?

11:39.274 --> 11:41.242
How are you doing?

11:41.409 --> 11:43.900
Seriously, Bobby,
it ain't like he's hexed, you know.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.103
What if this is the crazy you can't fix?

11:46.281 --> 11:50.775
Yeah, I'm worried too,
but humor me for a second.

11:50.952 --> 11:52.044
How are you?

11:52.920 --> 11:55.821
Who cares? Don't you think our mailbox
is full right now?

11:55.990 --> 11:57.480
- I'm fine.
- Right.

11:57.659 --> 12:01.686
And weren't you pissed at him
when he said the same thing...

12:01.863 --> 12:05.196
...a couple of hours before he spilled
his marbles all over the floor?

12:05.366 --> 12:07.095
Yeah, well...

12:08.336 --> 12:10.827
...I'm not Sam, okay?

12:11.372 --> 12:13.340
I keep my marbles
in a lead freaking box.

12:14.008 --> 12:15.498
I'm fine, really.

12:16.377 --> 12:17.935
Of course. Yeah.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.546
Just lost one of the best friends
you ever had...

12:20.715 --> 12:22.945
...your brother is in the bell jar...

12:23.117 --> 12:26.109
...and purgatory's most wanted
are surfing the sewer lines...

12:26.287 --> 12:28.118
...but, yeah, yeah, I get it, right.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.019
You're, uh... You're fine.

12:32.093 --> 12:33.583
Good.

12:39.100 --> 12:44.970
Of course, if at any time you wanna
decide that's utter horse crap...

12:45.139 --> 12:48.199
...I'll be where I always am,
right here.

12:49.711 --> 12:53.044
Well, you wanna do couples' yoga
or get back to hunting the big bads?

12:53.214 --> 12:54.476
Shut up.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.716
Idiot.

13:03.057 --> 13:07.494
Yeah? Up yours, Manning.
I still got.06 on your time.

13:09.030 --> 13:11.021
Hey, where were you guys?

13:11.199 --> 13:13.133
I guess we got here early.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.065
Heard something weird
come from the showers.

13:18.940 --> 13:21.568
Hey, heh, what are you doing?
You're gonna get in trouble.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.371
Yes, Scott. I probably am.

13:26.414 --> 13:29.383
What Williams is trying to say
is we're too hungry to care.

13:38.092 --> 13:41.858
Crying to the ER nurse,
screaming, "Mother Mary, mercy."

13:42.029 --> 13:46.864
And when they opened her back up,
three sponges and a set of clamps...

13:47.034 --> 13:49.264
...sewn up inside
like she was a living piñata.

13:49.437 --> 13:52.065
You can't trust these people, heh.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.605
Afternoon, ladies.

13:53.775 --> 13:55.265
Oh, hello, doctor.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.569
Hi, Dr. Gaines.

13:56.744 --> 14:00.111
So, Miss Mills,
you did excellent today.

14:00.281 --> 14:02.977
Just as we discussed,
it was a textbook appendectomy.

14:03.184 --> 14:05.311
- Good.
- You've been through a serious surgery.

14:05.486 --> 14:08.546
Now, I know you're tough...

14:09.724 --> 14:11.988
...but I want you
to take it easy tonight.

14:12.193 --> 14:14.388
- Works for me, doc.
- The good news:

14:14.562 --> 14:16.792
I put you down
for some pretty fun painkillers.

14:16.964 --> 14:18.056
Oh.

14:18.266 --> 14:21.565
I'll check in on you first thing.
You'll be home in no time.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.135
Thanks.

14:23.971 --> 14:25.905
Charming, isn't he? Heh.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.066
Did you know a study showed...

14:28.242 --> 14:31.075
...three-quarters of doctors
cheat on their exams?

14:31.245 --> 14:34.578
He might not know your appendix
from your vagina.

14:35.950 --> 14:37.440
Hey, there, Gunga Din. Buck up.

14:37.618 --> 14:40.519
We got some bad news for a change.
Stockville, North Kansas.

14:40.721 --> 14:44.122
Most of a school swim team got
mangled to death in their locker room.

14:44.292 --> 14:46.783
Cop talk on the wire
is kind of garbled.

14:46.961 --> 14:49.828
Saying it looks
like some kind of wild animal attack.

14:49.997 --> 14:53.455
They're saying whatever attacked them
is about the size of a linebacker.

14:53.634 --> 14:55.363
It's a lead, Dean.

14:55.536 --> 14:59.973
- If you think you're going out on a hunt...
- No, I know. I'm not. But you are.

15:01.509 --> 15:04.501
Look, Bobby is running the hub,
I'm 5150'd...

15:04.679 --> 15:06.772
...which leaves you
to follow this thing up.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.939
You're in the middle
of a psychotic break.

15:09.116 --> 15:12.279
It's a couple hours' drive
and it could be a Leviathan thing.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.313
- If you think I'm leaving you here alone...
- Hey, what am I?

15:16.491 --> 15:18.356
Chopped brains on toast?

15:18.526 --> 15:20.153
I can eyeball the kid. Go.

15:20.328 --> 15:23.263
Work off some of these nerves
on something useful.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.292
Fine.

15:42.283 --> 15:45.411
- You got yourself an awfully small body.
- Too small.

15:45.586 --> 15:48.987
She didn't know anything.
Can't even see over the counter.

15:50.024 --> 15:51.889
Well, this one:

15:52.593 --> 15:54.026
Edgar.

15:55.229 --> 15:58.721
Edgar worked on something
called a demolitions crew.

15:58.900 --> 16:02.392
Watching things blow up
is apparently very satisfying.

16:02.570 --> 16:06.233
Annie knew where babies come from.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.771
Disgusting, by the way.

16:08.943 --> 16:10.376
I'm hungry.

16:11.245 --> 16:12.542
We all are.

16:12.713 --> 16:14.112
Yes, about that.

16:15.950 --> 16:17.042
I'm sorry.

16:17.218 --> 16:20.187
Sorry? They ate the swim team.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.585
- Like I said, hungry.
- That's no excuse.

16:23.758 --> 16:28.525
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Get them in line. I don't care how.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.187
For God's sake, it made the papers.

16:31.365 --> 16:35.199
Look, the boss, honestly...

16:35.736 --> 16:37.795
...he just wants to hear
it's taken care of.

16:37.972 --> 16:39.132
So take care of it.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.337
Quickly.

16:41.842 --> 16:44.242
I don't like bringing him bad news.

16:44.412 --> 16:46.209
Are we clear?

16:46.380 --> 16:49.645
Actually, I have an idea.

16:49.850 --> 16:51.442
I could use your help.

17:08.368 --> 17:11.065
Little girl, can I help you?

17:12.440 --> 17:13.839
Are you a Dr. Sexy?

17:14.008 --> 17:16.943
Uh, well, I'm a surgeon, heh.

17:17.111 --> 17:18.907
Where are your parents?

17:19.079 --> 17:23.608
Is it true surgeons can just cut
into whatever body they want?

17:23.784 --> 17:24.944
What?

17:25.118 --> 17:27.416
And remove whichever organs
they please?

17:27.588 --> 17:30.785
- Where did you hear...?
- I wanna be a surgeon when I grow up.

17:33.461 --> 17:35.190
Let me go!

17:36.130 --> 17:39.588
And I want to grow up now.

17:56.717 --> 17:59.550
- Hi. Special Agent Anderson. Ian.
- Yeah, okay.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.154
- Go ahead.
- Our point cop is out on the doughnut.

18:02.323 --> 18:04.689
Forensics. Can show you the layout.
Step lightly.

18:04.859 --> 18:09.558
We got a whole bunch of NC-17
shiznickel right over there.

18:09.730 --> 18:11.561
Right.

18:28.449 --> 18:30.041
Damn it.

18:32.153 --> 18:37.318
- Shh, just breathe deeply.
- But my surgery isn't till tomorrow.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.083
I'm Dr. Sexy.

18:39.260 --> 18:41.160
Your surgery is when I say it is.

19:04.552 --> 19:05.712
Huh.

19:06.587 --> 19:08.851
Not weird at all.

19:35.149 --> 19:36.207
Yeah?

19:36.383 --> 19:37.407
<i>We are positive for ick.</i>

19:37.585 --> 19:39.883
Same kind of stuff
that came out of Cass.

19:40.054 --> 19:43.285
Uh, two swim kids are missing.
They stole one of their parents' cars.

19:43.457 --> 19:47.393
You know, I really think Prince William
has found the right girl.

19:48.028 --> 19:49.427
What do you think?

19:49.597 --> 19:53.966
So you think these, uh, heh, Leviathan
things just jump into people?

19:54.135 --> 19:57.434
<i>- Like Eve did?
- I don't know. It makes sense, right?</i>

19:57.605 --> 20:00.938
Uh, state troopers got surveillance
cam on the kids about six hours old...

20:01.108 --> 20:02.973
<i>...gassing up south of the Dakota line.</i>

20:03.144 --> 20:06.443
<i>So I'm headed back your way.
We'll just track them from Bobby's.</i>

20:06.614 --> 20:08.241
<i>- Ahem, yeah, sounds good.
- Hey.</i>

20:09.984 --> 20:11.144
How you doing?

20:15.589 --> 20:17.454
You know, uh, okay.

20:17.958 --> 20:20.859
Okay. Well, hang in there, all right?

20:21.929 --> 20:23.863
Just okay?

20:24.765 --> 20:27.666
Man, I'm having a great day. Hmm?

21:24.859 --> 21:26.486
Oh, no.

21:34.401 --> 21:37.131
Ms. Mills,
what are you doing out of bed?

21:37.371 --> 21:38.497
Are you okay?

21:44.245 --> 21:46.270
Ms. Mills, you gave us all a scare.

21:46.447 --> 21:47.675
What? No...

21:47.848 --> 21:50.544
You can't wander the halls like that
in your condition.

21:50.718 --> 21:52.117
He took... He took...

21:52.286 --> 21:54.413
What? Who?

21:55.422 --> 21:56.548
Dr. Gaines?

21:57.291 --> 22:01.227
Ms. Mills, we told you to take it easy,
remember?

22:01.729 --> 22:03.219
Of course.

22:03.397 --> 22:05.388
What were you doing
wandering the halls?

22:05.566 --> 22:07.261
Nothing. Um...

22:07.701 --> 22:10.465
My stitches itch.
I wanted to know if that was normal.

22:10.671 --> 22:12.263
I must have fainted or something.

22:13.107 --> 22:15.200
My stitches feel fine now.

22:15.776 --> 22:18.040
Ms. Mills, you can't get out of bed.

22:18.212 --> 22:21.545
You could have ripped open your sutures
with a fall like that.

22:22.483 --> 22:24.041
Don't make me go back in there.

22:26.120 --> 22:27.212
Okay?

22:29.089 --> 22:31.819
- What's that?
- It's just something to help you sleep.

22:32.459 --> 22:35.724
- No, that's okay. I'll sleep just fine.
- Doctor's orders.

22:39.133 --> 22:41.067
I'll check on you later.

22:48.809 --> 22:52.609
No. You can kiss my ass,
Dr. Monster-Face.

22:57.818 --> 22:58.944
Oh, God.

22:59.119 --> 23:01.019
Oh, no, no.

23:02.823 --> 23:05.485
Okay, if this is some dream
and you got power over it...

23:05.659 --> 23:07.820
- ...why don't you just end it?
- End it?

23:08.495 --> 23:11.487
This? You not knowing what's real...

23:11.665 --> 23:14.725
...the paint slowly peeling off
of your walls.

23:15.302 --> 23:19.238
Come on, man. This is the sweet spot.
Why would I end it?

23:19.673 --> 23:22.107
It's not like we got HBO in the pit.

23:22.276 --> 23:25.507
All I got is you
floating over the coals...

23:25.679 --> 23:29.012
...with half a hope
that you're gonna figure it all out.

23:29.183 --> 23:31.947
There's only one way to figure it out,
Sam.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.381
It's up to you.

23:33.554 --> 23:36.819
It ends when you can't
take it anymore.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.290
I think maybe that's why
we're cleaning our guns.

23:43.464 --> 23:44.556
Shut up.

23:45.332 --> 23:48.165
I said shut up!

23:48.335 --> 23:50.166
Hey, Sam.

23:51.005 --> 23:52.063
You, uh?

23:55.576 --> 23:57.339
You having a little bag lady moment?

23:57.778 --> 23:59.040
Sorry.

24:07.588 --> 24:09.215
Thanks.

24:16.597 --> 24:18.656
You know, after...

24:20.367 --> 24:21.925
...everything...

24:22.870 --> 24:25.862
...all these years,
all that we've been through...

24:26.573 --> 24:29.098
You beat the devil before, kid.

24:30.744 --> 24:32.439
It's kind of different, heh.

24:32.613 --> 24:34.410
Not really.

24:34.615 --> 24:36.446
You'll get a handle on this too.

24:36.617 --> 24:37.948
You will.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.381
You're not in hell anymore.

24:41.822 --> 24:44.256
You're here, with us.

24:51.331 --> 24:52.525
You hear me, Sam?

24:54.134 --> 24:55.601
Yeah, I hear you, Bobby.

24:57.404 --> 25:00.601
Oh. Uh, that's my local.

25:02.876 --> 25:05.777
- Hello.
- Bobby Singer?

25:06.580 --> 25:09.276
- My surgeon is a monster.
- Come again?

25:09.450 --> 25:13.045
He took my windbag roomie
and he ate her liver.

25:13.220 --> 25:16.383
Except he wasn't a surgeon. He...

25:16.957 --> 25:19.653
<i>Listen. His face was...</i>

25:19.860 --> 25:22.590
His mouth was this horrible th...

25:22.763 --> 25:25.664
- Who is this?
- It's Jody. Jody Mills.

25:25.866 --> 25:28.596
- Jody?
- Sheriff Mills.

25:28.969 --> 25:32.132
<i>- Gotcha.
- I can't exactly call a deputy here.</i>

25:32.306 --> 25:35.901
You and I killed zombies that one time.
You handle this kind of thing.

25:36.076 --> 25:38.510
<i>Please, get your ass here
to Sioux Falls General.</i>

25:38.679 --> 25:40.909
Before he eats me, Singer.

25:46.153 --> 25:51.489
Well, either Sheriff Mills is having
an Obamacare-insured opium dream...

25:51.658 --> 25:55.526
...or something is eating folks
down at Sioux Falls General Hospital.

25:59.199 --> 26:03.363
Look, I don't wanna bruise your ego
or anything, but...

26:03.537 --> 26:04.663
No, no, no. It's okay.

26:04.838 --> 26:07.807
Go, go, go. I'll watch the phones.

26:10.344 --> 26:12.039
So...

26:12.679 --> 26:15.113
...just you and me, huh?

26:18.318 --> 26:19.910
Now, what happened to you two?

26:21.121 --> 26:22.884
I did.

26:23.056 --> 26:25.718
- Where's Dr. Gaines?
- No, that's not how it works, okay?

26:25.926 --> 26:28.394
If you require a physician,
fill out these forms...

26:28.562 --> 26:30.826
I can take over from here, nurse.

26:30.998 --> 26:34.957
These youths obviously require
immediate care.

26:43.076 --> 26:45.567
Uh, this is where they bring
their bodies to be fixed.

26:45.746 --> 26:47.839
They consider it a safe place.

26:48.015 --> 26:52.076
But the truth is
often they actually die here instead.

26:52.252 --> 26:53.879
And they never question it.

26:54.054 --> 26:56.045
I'm not kidding.

26:57.357 --> 26:59.848
And we can feed discreetly.
No one will know.

27:00.027 --> 27:04.157
A few of us in the right positions
and we could feast every single day.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.391
I'm thinking head nurse
and the staff administrator for a start.

27:07.568 --> 27:10.696
I have to hand it to you.
It's exactly what the boss asked for.

27:10.871 --> 27:13.066
- Out-of-the-box thinking.
- Yes.

27:14.208 --> 27:16.073
You're off the swim team, boys.

27:16.843 --> 27:19.243
Time to pursue a career in medicine.

27:23.050 --> 27:24.517
All right. Check in.

27:24.685 --> 27:25.913
You won't stay?

27:26.086 --> 27:29.055
I would love
to grab us a good anesthesiologist.

27:29.223 --> 27:31.350
He asked me to check
into some other business.

27:31.525 --> 27:35.859
Anyway,
seems you've got things well in hand.

27:37.598 --> 27:38.895
Why can't they scream?

27:39.066 --> 27:41.227
Oh, I severed their vocal cords,
of course.

27:42.002 --> 27:45.768
It was a delicate procedure,
but very doable.

28:07.094 --> 28:08.925
- Dean.
- Hey.

28:09.096 --> 28:10.586
Oh, yeah. Good thinking.

28:10.764 --> 28:11.890
Uh...

28:13.634 --> 28:15.329
So I, uh...

28:15.936 --> 28:18.404
I followed those swim kid
Levia-whatever.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.802
- To where?
- Here. Well, back to town.

28:20.974 --> 28:23.465
- And that ain't the good news.
- What?

28:24.278 --> 28:26.974
- It ain't just two of them, I think.
- You call Bobby?

28:27.147 --> 28:30.639
He's working his own case. I gotta move.
I need backup. That means you.

28:30.817 --> 28:32.808
Wait. You sure about that?

28:32.986 --> 28:34.851
I know, you're bonkers.

28:35.055 --> 28:38.582
But I just need you to keep the engine
running and wait by the back door.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.693
Just don't, uh...

28:40.861 --> 28:43.955
Don't let Satan change my presets.
Let's go.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.801
Her name is Mrs. Hackett.
She never came back.

28:58.979 --> 29:00.207
I'll check it out.

29:00.380 --> 29:02.314
Now, you get some rest.

29:02.482 --> 29:04.507
I'll come by later.

29:08.889 --> 29:11.357
Bobby Singer, my hero.

29:11.525 --> 29:13.186
That's the roofies talking.

29:29.242 --> 29:33.235
Foot surgery, huh? Died this morning.

29:39.986 --> 29:43.251
Already autopsied? What the hell?

29:43.990 --> 29:47.255
How you doing, Sam,
in the head region?

29:47.427 --> 29:48.826
Devil still riding shotgun?

29:51.164 --> 29:54.031
Not right now, but yeah.

29:54.201 --> 29:55.668
Maybe we ought to get you...

29:55.836 --> 29:58.031
- I don't know, some...
- Heh, some what?

29:58.205 --> 30:01.038
Some professional help? Heh.

30:01.241 --> 30:04.870
What are they gonna do, Dean?
Just stuff me full of pills.

30:05.145 --> 30:07.045
We'll figure out some other option.

30:07.381 --> 30:08.905
Okay, yeah.

30:09.082 --> 30:10.913
Yeah,
but what are your other options?

30:11.685 --> 30:15.086
Remember when Martin took his nosedive
and started shooting at nothing?

30:15.255 --> 30:17.416
- His sweater unraveled fast.
- I'm not Martin.

30:17.591 --> 30:19.058
No, but you are crazy.

30:19.226 --> 30:21.956
That don't wash off.
You get that, right?

30:23.163 --> 30:26.064
Heh, you are never gonna be okay,
Sam.

30:49.122 --> 30:50.714
Sam?

30:52.459 --> 30:54.188
Sammy?

30:59.232 --> 31:00.893
Sam?

31:05.972 --> 31:08.099
Oh, crap.

31:28.995 --> 31:30.860
Oh, damn it. There's five of them.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.956
All right, come on.

31:34.134 --> 31:35.158
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

31:35.335 --> 31:38.031
Listen. When we get in there,
you gotta keep it together.

31:38.238 --> 31:40.206
- Uh, yeah, I will. L...
- If you see Lucifer...

31:40.373 --> 31:43.365
...you could be seeing all kinds of crap.
You just don't know.

31:43.543 --> 31:45.272
How is this helping?

31:45.445 --> 31:48.175
I'm just saying, Sam,
you're out of control.

31:48.381 --> 31:51.350
- I'm dealing with it the best I can.
- Dealing? Heh.

31:51.518 --> 31:55.352
I'm sorry. That's just funny.
I mean, how can you deal?

31:55.522 --> 31:58.116
You think this is an office building,
right?

32:00.961 --> 32:02.656
Sorry. Wrong.

32:04.064 --> 32:07.625
- Where the hell are we?
- Oh, you think I'm Dean?

32:08.001 --> 32:09.628
Right.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.969
You poor clueless son of a bitch.

32:13.473 --> 32:14.872
Stay the hell away from me.

32:15.509 --> 32:18.569
Your world is whatever
I want it to be, understand?

32:18.778 --> 32:20.643
Just leave me alone!

32:24.584 --> 32:26.552
Now we're getting there.

32:27.187 --> 32:29.348
Pinocchio is seeing his strings.

32:29.523 --> 32:31.855
- Shut up.
- It's the big crescendo.

32:32.025 --> 32:33.083
I said shut up!

32:33.827 --> 32:35.886
Wanna point that gun
at someone useful?

32:36.062 --> 32:37.222
Try your face.

32:38.932 --> 32:41.059
Wanna know the truth?

32:41.234 --> 32:43.168
Wanna skip to the last page
of the book?

32:45.338 --> 32:48.569
You know where to aim, cowboy.

32:54.347 --> 32:57.441
It's like a freaking doggy bag in here.

32:58.218 --> 33:00.345
Can I help you?

33:00.520 --> 33:03.318
Well, you can maybe still help
this hospital.

33:03.523 --> 33:06.253
Who's responsible for this sloppy bit
of documentation?

33:06.626 --> 33:08.787
- I know you.
- No, you got the wrong guy.

33:08.962 --> 33:12.591
Bobby Singer. Yes.

33:13.099 --> 33:14.464
We saw you.

33:14.834 --> 33:16.426
Through the angel's eyes.

33:20.574 --> 33:23.543
Well, let's try for amnesia, then.

33:33.853 --> 33:35.286
Fair enough.

33:41.361 --> 33:43.158
Ah, this can't be good.

34:02.248 --> 34:04.614
Sam? Sam?

34:06.953 --> 34:09.820
Oh, look, another me.

34:11.291 --> 34:13.259
Sam, what are you doing?

34:14.127 --> 34:15.150
Whoa, whoa.

34:15.328 --> 34:17.262
I thought I was with you, Dean.

34:17.931 --> 34:19.489
Okay.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.165
Well, here I am.

34:21.333 --> 34:23.632
No. No, I don't... l...

34:27.507 --> 34:30.101
I can't know that for sure.
You understand me?

34:30.810 --> 34:32.710
Then we're gonna have to start small.

34:33.346 --> 34:36.713
- I don't remember driving here.
- Well, that's because I drove.

34:36.916 --> 34:40.181
You thought. Sam is very suggestible.

34:41.955 --> 34:44.355
Whoa, whoa, Sam!

34:44.524 --> 34:47.960
This discussion does not require
a weapons discharge.

34:53.033 --> 34:54.295
Look at me.

34:56.569 --> 34:59.367
Come on.
You don't know what's real?

35:00.707 --> 35:03.733
Look, man, I've been to hell, okay?

35:03.943 --> 35:05.672
I know a thing or two about torture.

35:06.746 --> 35:09.977
Enough to know
that it feels different...

35:10.850 --> 35:16.152
...than the pain of this regular,
stupid crappy this.

35:16.322 --> 35:18.415
No. How can you know that for sure?

35:18.591 --> 35:20.218
Let me see your hand.

35:21.394 --> 35:23.385
No, no, no.
The gimp hand. Let me see it.

35:23.897 --> 35:26.593
Well, smell you, Florence Nightingale.

35:28.868 --> 35:29.994
Hey.

35:31.171 --> 35:32.604
This is real.

35:32.772 --> 35:35.935
Not a year ago, not in hell. Now.

35:36.109 --> 35:39.340
I was with you when you cut it.
I sewed it up.

35:39.913 --> 35:41.210
Look.

35:43.917 --> 35:46.511
We've done a lot more with pain.

35:46.686 --> 35:51.248
This is different, right? Than the crap
that's tearing at your walnut?

35:51.424 --> 35:53.392
I'm different. Right?

35:55.128 --> 35:56.527
Yeah, I think so.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.960
You sure about that, bunk buddy?

35:59.132 --> 36:01.293
Sam? Sam?

36:05.004 --> 36:06.130
Doesn't mean anything.

36:07.307 --> 36:11.300
Hey, I am your flesh-and-blood brother,
okay?

36:11.511 --> 36:14.571
The only one who can legitimately
kick your ass in real time.

36:14.748 --> 36:16.545
You got away.

36:17.784 --> 36:20.116
- We got you out, Sammy.
- Sammy?

36:21.521 --> 36:25.651
- Sammy, I'm the only one who can...
- Believe in that.

36:27.427 --> 36:30.055
Believe me, okay?
You gotta believe me.

36:30.230 --> 36:33.722
You gotta make it stone number one
and build on it.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.595
You understand?

36:36.136 --> 36:38.969
Yeah. Yeah, agreed.

36:48.348 --> 36:49.474
Bobby, hey.

36:49.649 --> 36:53.085
Sheriff was right. The hospital thing
is definitely our kind of thing.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.312
<i>I double-barreled one of them
in the morgue.</i>

36:55.488 --> 36:59.925
Silver buckshot, no effect.
Bled black ooze.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.357
<i>- Uh, Leviathan here?
- I'm falling back.</i>

37:02.562 --> 37:04.757
I'll meet you at the house.
We can regroup.

37:07.133 --> 37:08.623
Bobby's got a live one.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.327
Okay, well, let's go.

37:17.343 --> 37:20.870
- Look, when we get to Bobby's...
- It's okay, Dean. I'm good.

37:21.281 --> 37:24.216
No white rabbits. Ha.
I'm not seeing anything.

37:24.717 --> 37:27.686
Okay. Baby steps.

37:33.660 --> 37:35.491
Oh, no.

38:02.689 --> 38:04.247
Oh, no.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.029
Any sign of him?

38:24.644 --> 38:25.668
Place was torched.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.405
- Somebody knew what they were doing.
- Was Bobby there?

38:28.581 --> 38:30.173
I don't know.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.714
Bobby!

38:40.960 --> 38:42.894
<i>This is Bobby Singer's hotline.</i>

38:43.062 --> 38:44.393
<i>You should not have this number.</i>

38:45.765 --> 38:49.201
You cannot be in that crater back there.
I can't...

38:49.702 --> 38:54.799
<i>If you're gone, I swear I'm going to strap
my Beautiful Mind brother into the car...</i>

38:54.974 --> 38:56.874
...and I'm gonna drive us off the pier.

38:57.410 --> 38:59.708
You asked me how I was doing.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.681
Well, not good.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.180
Now, you said you'd be here.

39:06.486 --> 39:08.317
Where are you?

39:11.324 --> 39:12.951
Bobby?

39:14.127 --> 39:15.594
Bobby?

39:20.433 --> 39:22.094
Bobby?

39:27.607 --> 39:29.302
Bobby?

39:33.746 --> 39:35.304
Winchester.

39:35.815 --> 39:37.305
Congratulations.

39:37.483 --> 39:40.611
Apparently you two are competent
enough to warrant annihilating.

39:41.354 --> 39:43.083
I'd take it as a compliment.

40:07.447 --> 40:08.846
Dean, now.

40:24.197 --> 40:25.630
Sam.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.198
Sammy? Hey, come on now.

40:28.368 --> 40:30.859
I'm the one with the broken leg.
You gotta carry me.

40:31.037 --> 40:32.504
Sam?

40:46.152 --> 40:47.312
Sam?

40:47.653 --> 40:50.417
- You stay with me, you hear?
- Male, late 20s, head trauma.

40:50.590 --> 40:53.286
Signs of increasing
intracranial pressure.

40:54.861 --> 40:56.556
Hey, so maybe I'm not real.

40:56.729 --> 40:58.162
Nobody's perfect.

40:58.331 --> 41:00.561
But I'm not going anywhere, Sam.

41:01.801 --> 41:02.859
Sam? Sammy?

41:03.436 --> 41:04.528
He's seizing.

41:04.704 --> 41:05.728
<i>Ten of Valium.</i>

41:05.905 --> 41:08.499
- Copy. We're pulling into Sioux Falls.
- Sioux Falls?

41:08.674 --> 41:09.732
Sioux Falls General?

41:09.909 --> 41:11.171
No, no, no. God.

41:11.344 --> 41:14.336
No, you gotta take us somewhere else.
Anywhere, please.

41:14.747 --> 41:16.374
Yeah, okay, buddy.
