<i>El Gato!</i>

00:31.787 --> 00:34.776
<b>2x03- "Mermaid"</b>

00:58.397 --> 00:59.606
Hello, villains.

00:59.815 --> 01:01.692
It appears you have lost your way.

01:01.775 --> 01:04.236
Allow me to show you the door.

01:07.406 --> 01:08.657
We have lost nothing.

01:08.741 --> 01:11.244
We came here on purpose
to steal treasure.

01:11.326 --> 01:15.664
We are Ignacio Salamanca
San Cristobal III

01:15.748 --> 01:21.295
y Rafael Valenciana,
aka Los Niòos Sin Nombres,

01:21.461 --> 01:23.547
aka...
- Gentlemen.

01:23.756 --> 01:27.009
I am so sorry, but I am
now closed for the day.

01:27.218 --> 01:29.970
If you would like to resume,
you can come back tomorrow.

01:30.054 --> 01:31.555
But we have nowhere to sleep.

01:31.722 --> 01:34.558
There is an inn
about 200 kilometers that way.

01:37.311 --> 01:39.772
Now, buenas noches to you.

01:40.439 --> 01:43.442
Sundown.
Time for Puss to shine.

01:55.288 --> 01:56.371
<i>♪ He's Puss ♪</i>

01:56.538 --> 01:58.332

02:19.270 --> 02:21.021
Huh? Huh?

02:21.855 --> 02:23.816
Just me? Okay.

02:25.859 --> 02:26.819
Hola, Pajuna!

02:26.902 --> 02:30.114
I have a king's thirst for leche.
Hit me with the good stuff.

02:33.284 --> 02:35.828
Eh! Eh! Eh!
Aren't you forgetting something?

02:35.911 --> 02:38.831
Ah! Yes.
My apologies.

02:42.335 --> 02:44.962
No, I'm talking about
paying for your drink.

02:47.047 --> 02:48.132
I just did.

02:50.092 --> 02:52.928
Yeah, I'm well aware
of the charm thing,

02:53.012 --> 02:55.472
but you still have to pay for your...
- The world over,

02:55.555 --> 02:59.185
from the sands of Tunisia
to the cathedrals of Segovia,

02:59.268 --> 03:03.397
it is a known fact that all the ladies
love Puss in Boots.

03:04.106 --> 03:07.484
Right, okay.
Well then, tell me, what ladies?

03:07.567 --> 03:09.028
Me? Zapata?

03:09.195 --> 03:10.321
Hah!

03:11.405 --> 03:12.281
Mm...

03:12.614 --> 03:15.409
Dulcinea?
- Huh? We're just friends.

03:15.617 --> 03:17.244
Ha. Let me guess,

03:17.328 --> 03:22.541
these ladies of whom you speak
all come from faraway lands.

03:22.666 --> 03:23.500
Yes!

03:25.878 --> 03:28.255
Which means there's no way

03:28.381 --> 03:32.259
any of us could ever meet them
to confirm your claims, right?

03:32.509 --> 03:34.720
No. They are very private.

03:38.974 --> 03:43.187
So, it's like these ladies
who love ya... don't exist.

03:43.354 --> 03:46.648
Yes. So, you have heard of them.

03:51.987 --> 03:54.990
Why do they laugh?
- Don't pay them any attention, Puss.

03:55.157 --> 03:58.411
We all know you're a charmer.
They're just...

03:58.535 --> 04:00.996
...teasing you.

04:01.163 --> 04:04.291
Teasing you.

04:04.499 --> 04:06.752
Teasing? Me?

04:37.574 --> 04:39.534
Babieca, it was horrible.

04:39.701 --> 04:42.371
They were making the teases on me.

04:42.455 --> 04:45.124
Do my charms no longer work
on the women of San Lorenzo?

04:47.251 --> 04:48.377
A lake.

04:48.585 --> 04:50.170
And it is morning.

04:50.670 --> 04:52.381
Have I been riding all night?

04:55.008 --> 04:57.470
What is that heavenly sound?

05:09.564 --> 05:11.525
A mermaid!

05:25.622 --> 05:28.334
Leave her be!

05:28.501 --> 05:31.337
You are outnumbered...
Oh, it's you again.

05:32.463 --> 05:33.588
En garde!

05:37.551 --> 05:41.847
He broke my tushy.
- I still think he's pretty cool.

05:42.889 --> 05:45.851
That is how one makes grown men cry.

05:46.059 --> 05:47.520
Oh, mermaid!

05:47.602 --> 05:51.315
It is safe to come out now
and resume your beautiful singing.

05:58.905 --> 06:00.115
Whoa.

06:00.199 --> 06:03.869
I have
vanquished the villains. You are safe.

06:04.411 --> 06:05.745
<i>My...</i>

06:07.956 --> 06:10.625
heroooooo!

06:14.380 --> 06:17.591
You saved me!
- Anyone would have done the same.

06:17.674 --> 06:20.802
Do not thank me.
Seriously, do not thank...

06:20.886 --> 06:23.013
Huh?
- My name's Feejee.

06:23.138 --> 06:25.182
F-E-E-J-E-E.

06:25.349 --> 06:27.642
Well, yes, very nice to meet you.

06:27.851 --> 06:29.269
Good luck with everything.

06:36.151 --> 06:37.736
We need to leave. Now.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.365
Ooh!

06:45.118 --> 06:47.787
Where are you going?

06:47.871 --> 06:50.541
I must return to my home now.
My friends will be worried.

06:50.624 --> 06:53.793
Oh, I bet a handsome,
heroic cat such as yourself

06:53.877 --> 06:56.255
has all kinds of places to be.

06:58.591 --> 07:00.800
Uh, you like winking, too?

07:01.468 --> 07:03.262
Only to heroes.

07:08.517 --> 07:13.272
If you like that, then behold,
the double wink!

07:16.483 --> 07:18.193
I've never seen a wink like that.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.154
It took me many years to master.

07:21.238 --> 07:23.449
Again.

07:23.532 --> 07:25.659
Ah...
No, no, no.

07:30.997 --> 07:32.625
Say, do you like leche?

07:32.791 --> 07:36.211
Why? Are you offering
to buy a girl a drink?

07:36.462 --> 07:37.837
I am.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.725
Babieca, to San Lorenzo!

07:54.187 --> 07:56.273
Eh, pretty please?

08:10.370 --> 08:12.831
Oh, Feejee, that is so humorous.

08:12.998 --> 08:15.417
Puss.
- Ah, Pajuna.

08:15.501 --> 08:18.295
Just enjoying
a pleasant conversation with Feejee.

08:18.378 --> 08:20.464
Who, you will notice,
is a female.

08:20.547 --> 08:22.341
Oh, Puss, you flatter me.

08:22.424 --> 08:25.010
Can you ask your servant
if she has any salt water?

08:25.177 --> 08:27.929
I'd really love a glass of salt water.

08:29.431 --> 08:31.891
Um, Pajuna,
do you have any...

08:32.100 --> 08:33.143
No!

08:33.852 --> 08:35.520
Very well.
But you see?

08:35.645 --> 08:37.981
I do have female fans wherever I go.

08:38.063 --> 08:39.149
I beg your pardon?

08:39.232 --> 08:41.943
Remember? You were teasing me
about the ladies?

08:42.277 --> 08:43.986
And now, I have proven you wrong

08:44.070 --> 08:46.657
by bringing my friend Feejee
to the cantina.

08:48.659 --> 08:52.287
Ohh, right.
Eh, good job.

08:52.371 --> 08:57.584
Hah! Another insidious rumor
put to rest by Puss in Boots.

08:57.668 --> 09:00.086
Is there anything you can't do?

09:00.879 --> 09:01.880
No.

09:11.765 --> 09:13.225
The sun is so bright.

09:13.308 --> 09:16.687
It's drying my poor widdle fishy bits out.

09:17.229 --> 09:20.357
My moistening rag.
You don't mind, do you?

09:20.691 --> 09:23.485
Eh... Oh!
Heh, not at all.

09:35.038 --> 09:37.666
Ooh! That tickles.

09:40.126 --> 09:43.171
Well, I thank you for your company,
Seòorita Feejee.

09:43.255 --> 09:46.425
I will summon Babieca and return you
to your fishy home.

09:47.092 --> 09:48.343
Oh, not yet, Puss.

09:48.427 --> 09:50.763
You've been so kind to me,
I'd be remiss

09:50.845 --> 09:54.182
if I didn't repay you
and your beautiful town with a song.

09:54.307 --> 09:56.184
Truly, that is not necessary.

09:56.268 --> 09:58.437
Now come,
it is a long ride and...

09:58.645 --> 10:00.522
Please?

10:01.064 --> 10:02.982
All right, if you insist.

Lovely. Lovely.

10:50.864 --> 10:53.575
Thank you!
Did you like the words?

10:53.659 --> 10:57.245
I wrote them all by myself.
I used a baby squid as a pen.

10:57.370 --> 10:58.580
That was pretty.

10:59.790 --> 11:02.876
Whoa! Whoa!
- Puss, who is this woman?

11:02.959 --> 11:05.420
Um... this small child is Esme.

11:05.629 --> 11:07.881
Hi. I like your fish bottom.

11:07.964 --> 11:09.591
What's going on here?

11:09.758 --> 11:11.844
Stop looking at him!

11:21.645 --> 11:23.605
<i>Feejee, stop it!</i>

11:25.440 --> 11:26.692
<i>Oh, thank goodness.</i>

11:27.942 --> 11:29.319
What was that?

11:29.402 --> 11:32.947
Oh, just a thing mermaids do
where sometimes we get mad,

11:33.031 --> 11:35.617
and shriek so loud
it makes people's heads explode.

11:35.826 --> 11:41.790
Uh, well, that certainly is a thing
that I find very attractive.

11:42.624 --> 11:44.918
Aw!

11:45.001 --> 11:47.796
Anyway,
thank you for the lovely song

11:47.880 --> 11:49.130
and the pleasure of your company.

11:49.255 --> 11:51.633
I should probably take
you back now.

11:51.717 --> 11:53.343
But it's so late.

11:53.426 --> 11:54.636
Can I sleep here?

11:54.845 --> 11:56.346
But it is daytime.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.933
I'm asleep.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.812
I guess you are staying?

12:09.860 --> 12:11.069
Good morning, you.

12:11.277 --> 12:14.113
I watched you sleep, all night!

12:14.197 --> 12:16.867
You didn't move
but I kept right on staring.

12:16.950 --> 12:19.202
It is not morning, it...

12:19.994 --> 12:21.120
What is that smell?

12:22.956 --> 12:24.583
Just a little fin rot.

12:25.124 --> 12:26.459
Hey, I made breakfast.

12:32.716 --> 12:36.094
Don't be shy, eat.

12:36.803 --> 12:39.138
No, I am not very hungry...

12:39.347 --> 12:41.433
Aah! Okay, all right.
I am eating.

12:41.558 --> 12:42.684
Yes, yes.

12:42.768 --> 12:45.645
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

12:55.113 --> 12:55.989
Very good.

12:56.615 --> 12:58.408
We are so good together.

12:58.491 --> 13:01.119
I can just hear all the other mermaids.

13:01.202 --> 13:03.288
"Oh, Feejee doesn't deserve him.

13:03.371 --> 13:05.749
Feejee always gets the hotties.
Feejee's crazy."

13:05.874 --> 13:09.711
I have a mood disorder!
I am not crazy!

13:09.836 --> 13:13.172
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

13:17.302 --> 13:18.804
Claws!

13:18.971 --> 13:20.430
<i>And the wolf said,</i>

13:20.513 --> 13:24.350
"I'll huff and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house down."

13:24.434 --> 13:27.479
<i>I hate history class.
- Hola!</i>

13:27.687 --> 13:29.731
Notice anything different about me?

13:30.565 --> 13:32.317
You have a tail.

13:32.525 --> 13:34.653
Well, yes. But no.

13:34.736 --> 13:36.613
I am hideous!

13:40.951 --> 13:42.702
I can stand Feejee no longer.

13:42.786 --> 13:45.288
So, by changing the angle of my hat,

13:45.371 --> 13:47.624
I have made myself
unappealing to all women.

13:47.874 --> 13:51.294
Feejee will be disgusted
by my appearance and leave forever.

13:51.377 --> 13:55.256
Dashing. Hideous.
Dashing. Hideous.

13:55.340 --> 13:57.175
Brilliant.

13:57.425 --> 14:01.638
I don't know. You look pretty much
the same as always: awesome.

14:01.847 --> 14:04.265
You do not yet know the ways of women.

14:04.349 --> 14:06.977
Puss, if you want this to work,
you need to commit.

14:07.060 --> 14:09.688
Stop grooming for a few days,
let your boots get dusty...

14:09.938 --> 14:12.148
Dusty? Am I an animal?

14:12.231 --> 14:14.233
No, this has to work.

14:15.944 --> 14:17.988
Yes, I know. I am hideous.

14:18.071 --> 14:21.700
I will understand if you want
to leave me and never come back.

14:21.783 --> 14:23.535
Are you kidding?
I love it!

14:23.743 --> 14:24.828
What?

14:24.995 --> 14:27.413
I thought you were cute before,
but wow.

14:27.497 --> 14:30.667
Wearing your hat like that
has turned you into a real bad boy.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.502
Raarrr!

14:32.585 --> 14:35.005
We're gonna be together forever!

14:35.088 --> 14:37.256
How wonderful for me.

14:37.340 --> 14:41.219
Puss in Boots!
We have unfinished business.

14:41.427 --> 14:44.890
Oh, darn. I must be going.

14:50.729 --> 14:53.523
Gentlemen, I am so sorry
to have kept you waiting.

14:53.606 --> 14:56.693
No sweat.
Completely understand.

14:56.776 --> 15:00.072
I trust you were able to find
accommodations for the night?

15:00.947 --> 15:04.576
We slept beneath a cactus.
It was charming.

15:09.414 --> 15:10.790
Feejee, no!

15:12.375 --> 15:14.252
You fight dirty, Puss in Boots!

15:14.335 --> 15:16.295
And we will tell everyone.

15:16.546 --> 15:20.008
Wait, I do not fight dirty.
I can explain!

15:20.092 --> 15:22.635
It is a humorous story.

15:24.971 --> 15:27.432
You have just cost me
my reputation!

15:27.515 --> 15:30.435
I am so sorry,
but it is time for you to go.

15:30.769 --> 15:34.856
I thought you loved me!

15:35.065 --> 15:38.068
Why on earth would you think...
- Say you love me!

15:42.739 --> 15:45.408
I... love... you.

15:46.868 --> 15:49.162
Oh!

15:50.747 --> 15:53.917
Oh, my poor, sweet,
darling Puss.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.169
The words I've longed to hear!

15:56.377 --> 15:57.921
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

16:01.967 --> 16:05.637
I need to ask your help
with the Feejee situation.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.640
But first, I have a confession to make.

16:08.848 --> 16:11.225
I brought that fishy nightmare
to San Lorenzo

16:11.309 --> 16:14.646
because I wanted to prove to you all,
and to myself,

16:14.729 --> 16:16.314
that my charm still works.

16:16.522 --> 16:18.650
We got that.
- Well, yeah. Obviously.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.902
And now we all suffer as a result.

16:21.111 --> 16:22.445
I am sorry.

16:22.528 --> 16:25.657
You think you can just say sorry...
- Good! So all is forgiven.

16:25.949 --> 16:27.951
Now, how can I get rid of Feejee?

16:28.034 --> 16:29.702
She is positively obsessed with me.

16:29.786 --> 16:30.829
And dangerous.

16:31.037 --> 16:34.082
Puss, when you need
to get someone off of your tail,

16:34.248 --> 16:38.086
there's only one road to take:
faking your own death.

16:38.294 --> 16:40.755
It's easy as pie. Look.

16:40.964 --> 16:43.967
You see? I've faked
my own death so many times,

16:44.050 --> 16:46.178
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

16:46.260 --> 16:50.306
Eh... Oh.
I am a cow, right?

16:50.389 --> 16:52.058
This is preposterous!

16:52.142 --> 16:53.559
Surely there is another way.

16:53.685 --> 16:55.311
<i>Puss?</i>

16:55.394 --> 16:58.731
<i>Where are you?
Puss!</i>

16:58.815 --> 17:01.067
All right.
Let us plan my death.

17:09.325 --> 17:10.160
What?

17:10.367 --> 17:13.412
This is the part where you tell me
dishonesty is wrong.

17:13.621 --> 17:16.165
You know what?
This time, I'm fine with it.

17:16.290 --> 17:18.416
Feejee is the worst.

17:19.085 --> 17:21.838
Babieca, it is time. Go!

17:23.882 --> 17:25.090
Please?

17:30.429 --> 17:31.389
He's coming!

17:37.562 --> 17:38.855
Hey, Fish Lady!

17:38.938 --> 17:40.857
Come quick!
Puss is in trouble.

17:41.024 --> 17:42.441
What? What's wrong?

17:42.608 --> 17:45.028
It's Babieca.
He's gone cuckoo.

17:49.908 --> 17:50.825
Puss!

17:53.203 --> 17:54.954
Puss, wait!

17:59.584 --> 18:01.586
He's heading up toward the cliff.

18:02.962 --> 18:04.589
Somebody help him!

18:12.513 --> 18:13.598
Yes!

18:13.806 --> 18:16.101
Holy smokes!
- Oh, no!

18:16.184 --> 18:18.144
Did you know he is dead now?

18:20.730 --> 18:22.315
It's okay, Feejee.

18:22.440 --> 18:27.070
There are plenty of cats in the land sea.

18:27.153 --> 18:29.488
He was the greatest cat to ever live.

18:29.697 --> 18:33.952
He was so good to me!
Oh, how I loved him.

18:34.035 --> 18:36.162
Why?

18:36.370 --> 18:37.956
Why? Why?

18:52.595 --> 18:54.430
Feejee, stop!

18:57.516 --> 18:58.768
Puss!

19:00.561 --> 19:02.355
You're alive!

19:02.563 --> 19:04.774
Yes, yes, here I am.
It is...

19:04.941 --> 19:06.234
A miracle!

19:06.318 --> 19:08.987
Puss, don't you see?
It's a sign.

19:09.237 --> 19:10.071
Um...

19:10.280 --> 19:12.282
Let's get married!

19:13.658 --> 19:14.575
Uh...

19:18.746 --> 19:20.248
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

19:20.873 --> 19:22.416
Yes, all right, all right!

19:22.625 --> 19:24.961
<i>Oh, Puss.</i>

19:30.424 --> 19:32.885
Thanks for asking me
to be your best man, Puss.

19:32.969 --> 19:34.720
My pleasure.

19:34.804 --> 19:35.763
Bucket!

19:39.392 --> 19:42.812
Dulcinea, have you come to rescue me
from this horrible prison of love?

19:43.771 --> 19:45.815
I am her maid of honor.

19:55.033 --> 19:57.202
Bucket.

20:00.079 --> 20:01.331
Hello.

20:06.002 --> 20:09.172
All righty, block 187,
a true-to-life Feejee mermaid.

20:09.255 --> 20:11.590
Monkey face, fishy body,
dagger-like fangs,

20:11.674 --> 20:13.885
ability to burst a man's head
with her pipes.

20:14.052 --> 20:16.470
Do I hear 100 reales... Oh!

20:17.263 --> 20:19.015
Oh, sorry, wrong speech.

20:19.098 --> 20:21.434
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here

20:21.517 --> 20:24.229
to witness the forcible
marriage of Puss...

20:24.312 --> 20:26.981
to Feejee,
the fish-monkey abomination.

20:27.065 --> 20:28.233
Beautiful mermaid!

20:28.400 --> 20:30.484
Feejee, the beautiful mermaid.

20:30.568 --> 20:32.862
Do you take Puss to be your...
- Yes!

20:32.987 --> 20:33.863
All righty.

20:33.988 --> 20:37.075
And Puss, do you take Feejee
to be your creature wife?

20:37.283 --> 20:38.326
Uh...

20:51.047 --> 20:53.091
I...
- Wait!

20:57.011 --> 20:59.013
Stop this wedding!

21:02.850 --> 21:05.895
Brad!
- Feejee!

21:06.645 --> 21:09.065
Feejee, baby,
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

21:09.148 --> 21:12.151
After we got into that fight
and you said you were gonna

21:12.235 --> 21:15.113
force someone to marry you
to drive me crazy with jealousy,

21:15.280 --> 21:17.156
I never thought you'd actually do it.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.658
I said all that out loud?

21:19.867 --> 21:23.579
Wait. This was all a plot
to make your boyfriend jealous?

21:23.746 --> 21:25.373
But then I got this invitation,

21:25.457 --> 21:29.419
and when I thought I might lose you,
I finally realized the truth.

21:29.627 --> 21:33.172
I am a merman,
and you are a mermaid,

21:33.256 --> 21:36.092
but together, we are merm-us.

21:36.301 --> 21:38.094
Oh!

21:38.303 --> 21:41.847
Feejee, will you mer-marry me?

21:42.056 --> 21:45.393
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

21:49.230 --> 21:51.607
Sorry, but you're just not my type.

21:51.816 --> 21:53.109
What?

21:58.072 --> 21:59.824
<i>Ew...</i>

22:04.996 --> 22:06.331
The one that got away.

22:06.580 --> 22:08.749
I will think of her often.

22:10.251 --> 22:13.754
You really are unbelievable,
Puss, you know that?

22:13.838 --> 22:17.800
Your words, eyes,
and pretty much everything else say no,

22:17.883 --> 22:19.844
but your heart says yes.

22:20.678 --> 22:23.055
You have to admit,
it's pretty cute.

22:23.139 --> 22:25.766
Ugh. I can't deny it.

22:25.975 --> 22:29.479
- # Romance... #
- Behold! The double wink!

22:29.687 --> 22:32.023
That's just blinking!
