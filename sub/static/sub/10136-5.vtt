10:12.446 --> 10:14.614
You're looking at

10:12.446 --> 10:14.614

10:28.920 --> 10:30.547
I haven't seen her

10:28.920 --> 10:30.547

10:30.589 --> 10:34.092
Hey, I do not yell. I guide.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.803
When I was

10:34.134 --> 10:36.803
done guiding, she ran out.

10:36.844 --> 10:40.390
Oh, man, she-she

10:36.844 --> 10:40.390

10:42.267 --> 10:43.518
I love her, Mr. Tanner.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.438
I wish you two would

10:43.560 --> 10:46.438
stop using that word.

Absolutely.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.444
Great.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.905
Then I'd, uh, I'd like you

10:52.486 --> 10:55.905
to stop seeing her.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.449
Well, I can't do that.

Mr. Tanner, you're old.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.207

11:47.248 --> 11:49.083

12:01.762 --> 12:03.306
Steve, what about your parents?

12:03.348 --> 12:04.765
I'm sure

12:03.348 --> 12:04.765
they must be concerned

12:04.807 --> 12:07.726
that you're spending

12:04.807 --> 12:07.726
so much time with D.J.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.972

I'm here because

12:45.014 --> 12:47.058
I care about you.
