- [Cassie] Someone once said,

01:17.744 --> 01:19.612
"Life isn't about the
number of breaths you took.

01:19.646 --> 01:23.149
"It's about the moments
that took your breath away."

01:23.183 --> 01:24.818
It's a beautiful thought,

01:24.851 --> 01:27.253
but what about the
moments in between,

01:27.287 --> 01:29.856
the moments we don't expect

01:29.889 --> 01:34.727
and the little things that
don't seem important at first?

01:37.430 --> 01:38.264
- I'm sorry, what?

01:38.298 --> 01:42.302
(light orchestral music)

01:42.335 --> 01:43.436
- Oh, nevermind.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.340
So, Jeffrey, where do
you want to go tomorrow?

01:47.373 --> 01:49.642
- I don't know, Cass.

01:49.676 --> 01:50.577
I have a lot of
files to get through

01:50.610 --> 01:52.912
and I'll probably be
working all weekend.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.747
- But it's your birthday.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.715
- I will try and get this done,

01:55.748 --> 01:58.218
but, yeah, that sounds good.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.756
- [Cassie] Yeah, I think that's
the best course of action.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.657
- [Tessa] Hey, you.

02:04.691 --> 02:05.191
- Hey.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.327
Can I call you back?

02:08.394 --> 02:09.362
Thank you.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.697
- You're welcome.

02:10.730 --> 02:13.299
So, guess what Roger did.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.000
I know, but listen.

02:14.033 --> 02:15.135
This is actually really good.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.871
He has an in with the director
of the Miami City Ballet

02:17.904 --> 02:19.672
and he got us both an audition.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.241
- That's amazing.

02:21.274 --> 02:23.309
They're gonna love you.

02:23.343 --> 02:24.911
What did mom say?

02:24.944 --> 02:26.913
- Oh, well, um--

02:26.946 --> 02:28.281
- You haven't told
her, have you?

02:28.314 --> 02:29.282
- Not yet.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.216
- Are you serious?

02:30.250 --> 02:31.317
We have to call her right now.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.218
- Wait, hold on.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.253
It's so competitive.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.320
And you know how she gets.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.923
I don't want her to freak
out if I don't make it.

02:36.956 --> 02:37.790
- Hey, Tessa.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.192
- Hey, Jeffrey.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.829
- So, what are you gonna
do for his birthday?

02:42.862 --> 02:44.297
- We're gonna go to Rossi's.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.331
- Oh, that'll be nice.

02:45.365 --> 02:46.599
- Mm-hmm.

02:46.633 --> 02:47.800
- Okay, well, you have work to
do and I have errands to run,

02:47.834 --> 02:48.801
so I'll leave you to it.

02:48.835 --> 02:49.502
(light orchestral music)

02:49.536 --> 02:50.803
But I'll cook us dinner later

02:50.837 --> 02:52.438
and we can both
call mom together.

02:52.472 --> 02:57.243
(phone ringing)
- That sounds amazing.

03:02.715 --> 03:05.251
- Okay, still no answer.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.287
I'll just call again
in a little while.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.421
- Just leave a message.

03:08.454 --> 03:10.023
- Her voicemail's full.

03:10.056 --> 03:12.392
- Well, mom is a senior
citizen, you know?

03:12.425 --> 03:13.693
She probably watched
Wheel of Fortune

03:13.726 --> 03:14.394
and dozed off during Jeopardy!.

03:14.427 --> 03:15.428
(laughing)

03:15.461 --> 03:16.696
- Okay, I should crash.

03:16.729 --> 03:18.464
I have to be at the
airport at 6:30.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.733
- Yeah, I still haven't made
Jeffrey's birthday card.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.303
(light orchestral music)

03:23.336 --> 03:24.370
What?

03:26.072 --> 03:26.940
- I just always thought

03:26.973 --> 03:28.841
that you would be
the one to make it.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.311
I was always jealous of
how good you are, you know?

03:31.344 --> 03:32.845
- Yeah, but then reality set in

03:32.879 --> 03:35.281
and I had to be responsible.

03:35.315 --> 03:38.318
- Responsible, okay, but it
was like when daddy died,

03:38.351 --> 03:40.286
so did your dreams.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.788
You just gave up.

03:43.356 --> 03:46.359
- Uh, you're gonna be brilliant.

03:46.392 --> 03:50.296
Miami City Ballet's
new prima ballerina.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.397
- I love you, Cass.

03:51.431 --> 03:52.332
- I love you too.

03:52.365 --> 03:55.835
(grand orchestral music)

04:00.373 --> 04:04.344
(light orchestral music)

04:04.377 --> 04:05.044
Thank you.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.313
We need a few minutes.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.849
Happy birthday.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.519
I know it's silly.

04:13.553 --> 04:17.991
Since I was little I made
birthday cards for people.

04:18.024 --> 04:18.958
- Cassie--

04:18.992 --> 04:19.859
- Don't say anything.

04:19.892 --> 04:20.960
Just open it.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.836
- I don't understand.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.070
You're the dancer.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.008
- Well, I thought you, well,
we could take classes together.

04:35.041 --> 04:35.875
- Classes.

04:37.143 --> 04:38.878
You could teach them
and I would end up

04:38.911 --> 04:40.446
looking like an idiot.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.347
- Oh, come on.

04:41.381 --> 04:42.148
It would be fun.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.884
It would be like
a couple's thing.

04:44.917 --> 04:45.785
- Yeah.

04:45.818 --> 04:49.088
(dramatic orchestral music)

04:49.122 --> 04:52.492
You know they don't condone
workplace relationships.

04:52.525 --> 04:55.561
We both could lose our jobs
and you just got promoted.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.364
- Not if we're smart
and discreet about it.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.400
What are you trying to say?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.370
- Maybe we should
stop seeing each other

05:04.404 --> 05:06.873
before this gets more serious.

05:06.906 --> 05:07.607
- Maybe?

05:10.176 --> 05:14.047
- We can still be
friends, you know?

05:14.080 --> 05:15.348
- Friends, wow.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.551
- I don't wanna lost my job.

05:18.584 --> 05:21.120
- You are really something.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.057
(phone buzzing)

05:24.090 --> 05:25.491
- I'm gonna go.

05:26.592 --> 05:27.627
- Hello?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.095
- [Tessa] Hey, I just got
a call from the hospital

05:29.128 --> 05:30.897
and mom had a heart attack.

05:30.930 --> 05:31.798
- What?

05:31.831 --> 05:33.132
Oh my gosh, is she--

05:33.166 --> 05:34.100
- [Tessa] She is stable.

05:34.133 --> 05:35.535
Okay, so I hope to get there.

05:35.568 --> 05:36.602
- Okay, good.

05:36.636 --> 05:38.071
- [Tessa] Okay, and don't worry.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.472
She seems fine at this point.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.541
- Okay, what time
is your flight?

05:41.574 --> 05:43.976
- [Tessa] It's gonna
be at 8:30 tonight.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.946
- I'll be there
as soon as I can.

05:46.979 --> 05:49.916
(airplane passing)

05:53.186 --> 05:56.122
(light rock music)

06:17.577 --> 06:19.045
(dramatic orchestral music)

06:19.078 --> 06:20.446
What's the latest?

06:20.480 --> 06:21.848
- The doctor said that
the first few days

06:21.881 --> 06:23.082
are the most critical.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.184
They need to monitor her.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.891
- Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

06:32.658 --> 06:33.526
- Oh, mom.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.163
- Now that both my
beautiful girls are here,

06:37.196 --> 06:39.098
I'm gonna be just fine.

06:39.132 --> 06:42.101
- And in order to be just
fine, she needs plenty of rest.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.136
- We'll be quick.

06:43.169 --> 06:44.103
- You got it.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.874
- You get some sleep.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.075
We love you.

06:49.108 --> 06:50.643
- I love you too.

06:52.178 --> 06:55.915
(upbeat orchestral music)

07:05.057 --> 07:05.925
- Stop.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.696
(doorbell ringing)

07:23.209 --> 07:25.545
(sighing)

07:26.646 --> 07:29.982
Hey, are either one
of you Ms. Daniels?

07:32.151 --> 07:33.219
- [Both] Yes.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.087
- Okay, so I have--

07:35.121 --> 07:36.689
- [Marsha] Sam, is that you?

07:36.722 --> 07:37.623
- [Sam] Hey, Marsha, I--

07:37.657 --> 07:39.725
- What are you doing here?

07:39.759 --> 07:41.060
- [Sam] I'm just giving--

07:41.093 --> 07:43.029
- Where are my manners?

07:44.197 --> 07:45.164
Hey, ya'll.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.098
I'm Marsha.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.201
I moved in just down
the street last year

07:48.234 --> 07:51.704
and I look in on your
momma every now and again.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.940
You're Cassie and you're Tessa.

07:53.973 --> 07:54.674
Am I right?

07:54.707 --> 07:55.575
(laughing)

07:55.608 --> 07:57.043
Of course I am.

07:57.076 --> 07:58.544
I could recognize you
to in a church hall

07:58.578 --> 07:59.745
on free catfish night.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.180
(laughing)

08:01.214 --> 08:02.114
- So, I have--

08:02.148 --> 08:03.950
- Oh, don't be silly.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.151
I've got plenty.

08:05.184 --> 08:06.219
Come on.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.090
- So, I'm here to give--

08:11.123 --> 08:12.091
- Don't be silly.

08:12.124 --> 08:13.326
Join us.

08:13.359 --> 08:15.962
Oh my, I hope you aren't
vegetarians, are you?

08:15.995 --> 08:17.063
Or one of them veganites.

08:17.096 --> 08:17.964
- Well, I actually do try--

08:17.997 --> 08:19.732
- Absolutely not.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.133
- I'm a vegetarian.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.201
- Since when?

08:22.235 --> 08:25.104
Well, whatever floats
that little boat of yours.

08:25.137 --> 08:26.272
(laughing)

08:26.305 --> 08:30.176
I guess you'll miss out on
this tasty meat sauce then.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.711
So, how's your momma doing?

08:31.744 --> 08:32.979
- She's resting comfortably.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.181
- Oh, that's fantastic news.

08:35.214 --> 08:37.149
I tried to visit her,
but she was in the ICU

08:37.183 --> 08:39.118
and they said only
immediate family was allowed

08:39.151 --> 08:40.720
and as much as I
feel like I family,

08:40.753 --> 08:43.256
I certainly wasn't gonna
try to pull a fast one.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.124
Although, if i kept flirting
with that male nurse,

08:45.157 --> 08:46.592
I might've gotten in to see her.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.027
(laughing)

08:48.060 --> 08:50.596
Look at me, inviting
myself in and rambling on.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.799
I'm sure ya'll have plenty
to do without silly old me

08:53.833 --> 08:54.800
making a fuss.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.370
- Okay, so I'm actually
here to serve a notice

08:57.403 --> 09:00.606
on foreclosure proceedings
on the dance studio.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.008
(dramatic orchestral music)

09:02.041 --> 09:04.043
It's my first, so I'm
like a little nervous,

09:04.076 --> 09:06.746
but sorry, but Marsha,
thank you for this carrot.

09:06.779 --> 09:08.080
It's wonderful.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.181
Goodbye.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.216
I'm gonna go out this way.

09:10.249 --> 09:11.117
All right.

09:12.752 --> 09:14.754
(door closing)

09:14.787 --> 09:16.322
- Ain't that a buzzkill?

09:16.355 --> 09:19.392
Okay, well, it certainly
was nice meeting you two.

09:19.425 --> 09:21.827
(laughing)

09:24.664 --> 09:26.265
Please give my best
to your mother.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.201
I know she'll be back
on her feet in no time.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.237
Sorry about the bad news.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.305
Toodles.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.341
- Wow.

09:37.209 --> 09:40.146
(upbeat pop music)

09:54.694 --> 09:56.662
- One, two, three, four,

09:56.696 --> 09:58.364
left side, turn.

09:58.397 --> 09:59.432
- [Cassie] Tess, I'm
not gonna let you

09:59.465 --> 10:00.366
miss this opportunity.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.101
Mom would be so disappointed.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.403
- There will be other auditions.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.138
- Can I help you?

10:06.172 --> 10:06.872
- Roxy.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.207
- Ah.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.241
- Hi, Roxy.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.676
- Hi.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.278
Been doing my best
to hold down the fort

10:12.311 --> 10:14.080
in your momma's absence.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.681
I trust she's doing well.

10:15.715 --> 10:16.382
- Oh, yeah.

10:16.415 --> 10:17.683
She's still her stubborn self.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.252
(laughing)

10:20.286 --> 10:22.254
- Oh, this is one of our
new little ballerinas,

10:22.288 --> 10:24.757
Emily and her
mother Linda Rogers.

10:24.790 --> 10:25.458
- Hi.

10:25.491 --> 10:26.359
- Hi.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.829
- This is Miss Cassie
and Miss Tessa.

10:29.862 --> 10:31.364
Miss Kate's daughters.

10:31.397 --> 10:34.367
- Miss Kate is the best
dance teacher ever.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.769
I sure hope she gets
better real soon.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.437
- Aw, thank you, Emily.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.772
It's so nice to meet you.

10:39.805 --> 10:40.706
- Nice to meet you.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.708
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.744
- You know, when Dean and I
heard about what happened,

10:44.777 --> 10:46.245
we were just sick.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.214
If there's anything we can
do, please let us know.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.115
- Oh, thank you.

10:49.148 --> 10:49.682
That's very kind.

10:49.715 --> 10:50.483
(light orchestral music)

10:50.516 --> 10:51.350
- Excuse me, duty calls.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.218
- Sure.

10:52.251 --> 10:53.285
- Rogers, of course.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.821
Um, Dean is a very lucky man.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.323
We went to school together.

10:57.356 --> 10:58.257
- Oh, no.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.191
I'm Dean's sister.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.227
I was two years ahead
of you in school.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.129
- Oh, yeah.

11:03.162 --> 11:03.863
I remember.

11:03.896 --> 11:04.663
You were a--

11:04.697 --> 11:07.466
- Chubby,
pimple-faced, bookworm?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.268
- Well, you look great.

11:09.301 --> 11:10.736
- Thank you.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.905
Emily is Dean's niece.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.807
- So, how is Dean?

11:14.840 --> 11:17.376
- Dean is a hard dog to
keep under the porch,

11:17.410 --> 11:19.345
to say the least.

11:19.378 --> 11:20.413
Emily, let's get going.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.414
- But I like it here.

11:21.447 --> 11:22.381
- We have somewhere to be.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.249
It's so nice to see you all.

11:23.282 --> 11:24.483
- [All] Bye.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.384
- Goodbye.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.758
- Roxy, we know the
studio is having problems.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.326
- You could say that.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.296
Look, your momma
is an amazing woman

11:37.329 --> 11:39.198
and I know she's doing
the best she can,

11:39.231 --> 11:42.468
but she was never interested
in making any changes

11:42.501 --> 11:44.437
to keep the studio afloat.

11:44.470 --> 11:48.307
(dramatic orchestral music)

11:48.340 --> 11:50.910
I'll show you the books
whenever you're ready.

11:50.943 --> 11:51.944
- Okay, thank you.

11:51.977 --> 11:52.845
- Thanks.

11:56.282 --> 11:56.816
(sighing)

11:56.849 --> 11:57.850
I could use some air.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.751
- Me too.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.389
- Hola, Cassandra and Theresa.

12:03.422 --> 12:04.290
(upbeat Latin music)

12:04.323 --> 12:05.825
- [Both] Hola, Victor.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.494
- You get more beautiful
each time I see you.

12:08.527 --> 12:09.562
(laughing)

12:09.595 --> 12:13.799
And you, my dear, we could
dance the night away.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.534
Oh, please give your
mom my very best.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.236
But now, I must prepare

12:17.269 --> 12:20.306
to teach tonight's
advanced ballroom.

12:20.339 --> 12:22.575
Hasta luego, mi amigas.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.543
- [Both] Adios, Victor.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.979
- What would this place
be like without him?

12:27.012 --> 12:27.880
- I know.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.181
(laughing)

12:29.215 --> 12:32.785
(light orchestral music)

12:39.291 --> 12:39.992
- Hey.

12:40.025 --> 12:41.327
- [Tessa] Hey.

12:43.462 --> 12:44.296
Thank you.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.865
- You're welcome.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.304
I can't believe
she didn't tell us.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.907
I mean, from what it
looks like, the mortgage

12:54.940 --> 12:56.876
hasn't been paid
in over six months.

12:56.909 --> 12:57.977
- Wow.

12:58.010 --> 12:58.878
(dramatic orchestral music)

12:58.911 --> 13:00.946
Okay, what are we gonna do?

13:00.980 --> 13:03.382
- Nothing we can
do at this hour.

13:03.415 --> 13:06.352
(glasses clinking)

13:12.658 --> 13:14.293
- You sure had it
bad for Dean Rogers.

13:14.326 --> 13:15.361
Remember?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.434
(wind rushing)

13:28.407 --> 13:29.241
- Hey.

13:29.275 --> 13:30.176
- Hey, Cassie, what's up?

13:30.209 --> 13:32.278
- Well, I haven't
seen you at the studio

13:32.311 --> 13:34.380
the past couple of weeks and
we don't have any classes--

13:34.413 --> 13:36.382
- I'm not going back.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.319
I'm quitting dance.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.922
- But you're so good.

13:42.955 --> 13:44.323
You love it.

13:44.356 --> 13:45.491
- My mom made me go.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.993
She's not making me anymore.

13:49.595 --> 13:52.298
- Well, happy birthday, Dean.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.100
Hey, Amber.

13:55.134 --> 13:56.035
- You're a day late,
a dollar short,

13:56.068 --> 13:59.572
and way out of your
league, little miss.

14:01.407 --> 14:02.308
- Let's go.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.316
(crying)

14:12.685 --> 14:16.355
- [Cassie] I can't believe I
never told you that before.

14:16.388 --> 14:16.889
- I knew.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.559
I saw the whole thing.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.428
I went back to get the
card out of the trash can,

14:22.461 --> 14:23.929
but it was gone.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.033
- You're amazing, you know that?

14:28.067 --> 14:29.101
- Thank you.

14:29.134 --> 14:30.369
(laughing)

14:30.402 --> 14:31.403
- Good morning.

14:31.437 --> 14:32.304
- [Tessa] Hi, mom.

14:32.338 --> 14:33.372
- Hey, mom.

14:33.405 --> 14:33.939
How are you feeling?

14:33.973 --> 14:36.008
- Ah, fair to middlin'.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.310
- Ladies, please keep
it short and sweet.

14:38.344 --> 14:39.078
- Of course.

14:39.111 --> 14:40.379
- Thank you.

14:40.412 --> 14:41.513
- So, the doctor says
my blood pressure's

14:41.547 --> 14:43.549
still a little bit too high,

14:43.582 --> 14:46.085
but my heart seems to
be doing pretty good.

14:46.118 --> 14:47.453
- That's good news, yeah?

14:47.486 --> 14:48.554
- I'm still kickin', ain't I?

14:48.587 --> 14:49.488
(laughing)

14:49.521 --> 14:50.723
- Yes, you are.

14:50.756 --> 14:52.458
- And Tessa has some good news.

14:52.491 --> 14:53.692
- It's not a big deal.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.327
- If you don't tell her, I will.

14:55.361 --> 14:57.029
- Tessa, don't make
me get out of this bed

14:57.062 --> 14:59.465
and give you a piece of my mind.

14:59.498 --> 15:00.366
- Okay.

15:01.367 --> 15:04.637
I got an audition for
the Miami City Ballet.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.572
- That's fantastic.

15:06.605 --> 15:07.640
You're gonna be amazing.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.341
I'm so proud.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.143
- No, I'm actually,
I'm not gonna go.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.344
I'm gonna stay with you.

15:12.378 --> 15:13.412
- What?

15:13.445 --> 15:14.380
- The doctors here are
gonna fix me up like new.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.116
I'm gonna be back to
that studio in no time.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.450
- No, mom, please.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.419
It's really not a big deal.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.554
- It's settled then.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.190
You are going to the audition.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.994
You two need to
skedaddle outta here.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.129
Go.

15:30.162 --> 15:33.132
- There's no use arguing, Tess.

15:33.165 --> 15:34.033
Love you.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.402
- Love you, mom.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.508
- Think of what it will
mean for the studio

15:42.541 --> 15:44.576
when you get accepted to
the Miami City Ballet.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.378
People will be lining
the streets to study

15:46.412 --> 15:47.780
where Tessa Daniels
used to dance.

15:47.813 --> 15:48.580
(laughing)

15:48.614 --> 15:51.684
- Well, when you
put it that way...

15:53.519 --> 15:54.720
(upbeat hip hop music)

15:54.753 --> 15:55.754
♪ We have a code red

15:55.788 --> 15:56.655
♪ Listen all the fellas

15:56.689 --> 15:57.723
♪ Trip hop battles
like we reppin' ♪

15:57.756 --> 16:00.125
♪ Used to be was steppin',
now I'm sweatin' ♪

16:00.159 --> 16:02.661
- Yeah, I didn't like
hip hop at first either,

16:02.695 --> 16:05.030
but it kinda grows on you.

16:05.831 --> 16:07.499
- I'll take Merle
Haggard any day.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.401
- Five, six, seven, eight.

16:09.435 --> 16:10.536
One, two, three, four,

16:10.569 --> 16:12.104
five, six, seven, eight.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.639
Up, hit, seven, eight.

16:13.672 --> 16:16.175
One, two, three, four, whoo!

16:16.208 --> 16:17.643
Good job, everyone.

16:17.676 --> 16:18.544
(clapping)

16:18.577 --> 16:20.579
Much much better, Billy.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.184
- We're teaching hip hop?

16:25.217 --> 16:26.251
- Yes.

16:27.453 --> 16:28.587
- Interesting.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.422
- Just trying to bring this
place into new millennia,

16:30.456 --> 16:31.190
that's all.

16:32.257 --> 16:34.059
- I don't know how my mom
would feel about that,

16:34.093 --> 16:36.128
but if it's bringing
customers in,

16:36.161 --> 16:39.098
I guess it could only help.

16:39.131 --> 16:40.699
(laughing)

16:40.733 --> 16:42.701
(upbeat orchestral music)

16:42.735 --> 16:43.602
- Cassie?

16:46.138 --> 16:46.772
- Oh, hi, Dean.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.207
- Hey.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.209
- I didn't expect
to see you here.

16:50.242 --> 16:52.211
- It's so great to see you.

16:52.244 --> 16:53.212
- Uh, yeah.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.217
- Have you met my niece, Emily?

16:58.250 --> 16:59.218
- Yes, hi, Emily.

16:59.251 --> 17:00.552
It's nice to see you again.

17:00.586 --> 17:01.787
- Hi, Miss Cassie.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.822
Are you and Uncle Dean friends?

17:03.856 --> 17:04.723
- [Dean] Yes, we--

17:04.757 --> 17:06.658
- We used to be.
- Are.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.862
- Okay, I have to
get ready for class.

17:09.895 --> 17:10.829
Bye.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.065
- [Cassie And Dean] Bye.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.201
- Hey, how's your mom doing?

17:16.235 --> 17:17.569
- Resting comfortably.

17:17.603 --> 17:18.670
- That's good to hear.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.605
(light orchestral music)

17:19.638 --> 17:21.640
And Tessa, how's Tessa?

17:21.673 --> 17:22.808
- Just missed her.

17:22.841 --> 17:24.476
- Oh.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.246
- She's auditioning for
the Miami City Ballet.

17:27.279 --> 17:28.313
- That's great.

17:29.782 --> 17:30.816
- Yeah.

17:30.849 --> 17:34.653
- So, um, how long are
you gonna be in town for?

17:34.686 --> 17:37.256
- Just long enough for mom
to get back on her feet

17:37.289 --> 17:40.292
and figure out what's
going on with the studio.

17:40.325 --> 17:41.193
- Everything okay?

17:41.226 --> 17:43.595
- Nothing I can't handle.

17:43.629 --> 17:44.797
- Well, look, tiny dancer,

17:44.830 --> 17:47.766
it's great to see you again.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.201
- It's good to see you too,

17:49.234 --> 17:51.203
but please don't
call me that anymore.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.171
- Come on.

17:52.204 --> 17:53.639
You used to love it
when I called you that.

17:53.672 --> 17:55.274
- Yeah, I grew up.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.881
I'll be right with you.

18:02.915 --> 18:03.782
- Hey, um,

18:05.350 --> 18:06.285
give me a call.

18:06.318 --> 18:07.686
Let's catch up.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.588
- Yeah.

18:11.356 --> 18:12.224
- Bye.

18:21.366 --> 18:24.269
- So, what are our options?

18:24.303 --> 18:27.806
My dad's estate,
his life insurance?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.808
- She used that for
renovations to the studio

18:29.842 --> 18:32.244
and with the second mortgage,
there's nothing left.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.912
(dramatic orchestral music)

18:33.946 --> 18:35.948
The studio's been in
trouble for a long time now.

18:35.981 --> 18:39.585
I know how much it means to
her and I'm gonna do my best

18:39.618 --> 18:42.955
to keep it quiet, but it's
eventually gonna get out.

18:42.988 --> 18:44.623
- It's appreciated.

18:45.390 --> 18:46.825
It's a lot to process.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.360
- Let's chat again
when you have a moment

18:48.393 --> 18:50.229
and I will do my best to
help in any way I can.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.296
- Thank you.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.698
- Thank you for the coffee.

18:52.731 --> 18:53.599
Take care.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.567
- Thank you, Mr. William.

18:55.601 --> 18:56.401
- [Tessa] Can we take out a loan

18:56.435 --> 18:58.704
or a second mortgage
or something?

18:58.737 --> 18:59.972
- [Cassie] I don't think so.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.974
I certainly won't qualify.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.775
- [Tessa] Me neither.

19:05.777 --> 19:06.879
- Hey, why don't you dance?

19:06.912 --> 19:07.946
Don't talk on the phone.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.248
- Seriously, you text 24/7.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.316
I'll be done in a minute.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.284
- Whatever.

19:14.353 --> 19:15.854
- So, what's next?

19:15.888 --> 19:17.856
- Well, Mr. William gave
us a little more time

19:17.890 --> 19:18.924
to find a solution.

19:18.957 --> 19:22.594
I don't know if that means
finding a buyer or what,

19:22.628 --> 19:25.797
but just the idea of
closing the studio

19:27.266 --> 19:28.867
after all the work mom
and dad put into it

19:28.901 --> 19:30.402
just seems wrong.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.373
- Mom will be devastated.

19:34.406 --> 19:36.742
- I know it's silly to ask
you not to worry about this,

19:36.775 --> 19:39.244
but try not to, okay?

19:39.278 --> 19:40.812
How's audition prep going?

19:40.846 --> 19:41.947
- Go figure.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.916
We rush out here and then
they push it back a week,

19:43.949 --> 19:45.717
but I think we'll be ready.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.886
- Well, you're gonna be great.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.054
Remember, I'm counting
on you to make it,

19:49.087 --> 19:52.791
so we can parlay your fame
into success for the studio.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.393
(laughing)

19:54.426 --> 19:55.961
- So, no pressure then, right?

19:55.994 --> 19:57.729
- None at all.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.299
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

20:02.401 --> 20:03.035
(light classical music)

20:03.068 --> 20:05.404
(sighing)

20:21.086 --> 20:24.323
(camera clicking)

20:38.103 --> 20:41.373
- Miss Roxy knows how much I
absolutely love working here

20:41.406 --> 20:43.442
and I've tried to be optimistic,

20:43.475 --> 20:45.911
but we've had to go without
paychecks several times

20:45.944 --> 20:48.313
in this past year.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.048
(dramatic orchestral music)

20:50.082 --> 20:52.818
I got an offer from On
Your Toes in Bella Springs

20:52.851 --> 20:54.987
and I assure you
I wasn't looking,

20:55.020 --> 20:58.390
but I can't pass up
this opportunity.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.092
- Well, I mean, as much
as we hate to see you go,

21:00.125 --> 21:02.094
I completely understand.

21:02.127 --> 21:04.329
- I really do wish you
guys the very best.

21:04.363 --> 21:07.332
I hope to see you and
your mom very soon.

21:07.366 --> 21:08.400
- Yeah.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.337
- [Roxy] Take care.

21:12.371 --> 21:13.772
- You too.

21:13.805 --> 21:14.506
Ciao.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.115
(upbeat orchestral music)

21:23.148 --> 21:26.985
- I'm certainly not
teaching that class.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.388
But I'm happy to accompany you.

21:29.421 --> 21:32.858
(light piano music)

21:32.891 --> 21:34.426
- Then I guess I am.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.996
(upbeat orchestral music)

21:38.864 --> 21:40.065
Hello.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.701
For those of you who don't know
me, my name is Miss Cassie.

21:42.734 --> 21:43.802
- You're Miss Kate's daughter.

21:43.835 --> 21:44.970
I remember you.

21:45.003 --> 21:46.438
You and that
good-looking young man

21:46.471 --> 21:48.440
were always dancing together.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.142
What was his name?

21:50.175 --> 21:51.943
- [Woman] It's Dean.

21:51.977 --> 21:56.415
- Um, so, I'll be
teaching your class today.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.050
- Where's Mr. Victor?

21:59.418 --> 22:00.819
- He moved on to
greener pastures.

22:00.852 --> 22:01.853
(gasping)

22:01.887 --> 22:02.921
- He died?

22:02.954 --> 22:03.855
- Oh, no no no.

22:03.889 --> 22:04.823
He got another job.

22:04.856 --> 22:05.557
I'm sorry.

22:06.692 --> 22:10.128
We wish him well and until
we can find a replacement,

22:10.162 --> 22:12.397
you're gonna be stuck with me.

22:12.431 --> 22:13.965
- We were learning the Cha Cha.

22:13.999 --> 22:14.800
- Oh, perfect.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.769
The Cha Cha is
lively, flirtatious,

22:17.803 --> 22:20.005
and full of passionate energy.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.773
Okay, then I'm gonna
need a partner.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.575
Can I have a volunteer?

22:28.046 --> 22:30.549
- I'd be happy to help you.

22:30.582 --> 22:32.150
- Thank you, sir, but
it really should be

22:32.184 --> 22:33.452
one of the students.

22:33.485 --> 22:34.352
- Sir?

22:34.386 --> 22:36.121
Yeah, I just, you
know, I meant that,

22:36.154 --> 22:38.990
it didn't seem
like you had any...

22:39.024 --> 22:40.125
My bad, carry on.

22:40.158 --> 22:41.893
- [Woman] Oscar,
Oscar, get up there

22:41.927 --> 22:42.761
and dance with Miss Cassie.

22:42.794 --> 22:45.864
(grumbling)

22:45.897 --> 22:46.832
- Awesome.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.034
Okay, so, the Cha Cha
requires small steps

22:49.067 --> 22:50.869
and a lot of hip movement.

22:50.902 --> 22:53.939
It's in four-four time and
the third and the fourth beat

22:53.972 --> 22:56.441
are split into three.

22:56.475 --> 22:58.143
One, two, cha cha cha.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.948
Okay, so, to start, the male
partner's gonna step forward

23:02.981 --> 23:04.783
on his right foot

23:04.816 --> 23:07.786
and his partner's gonna
step back with her left

23:07.819 --> 23:10.155
and then we're gonna
come back to the center

23:10.188 --> 23:12.190
and then cha cha cha in place.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.859
- Ah, my toe.

23:13.892 --> 23:14.559
Come on.

23:14.593 --> 23:15.427
- It's okay.

23:15.460 --> 23:16.194
When we have the
music, you'll feel it.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.496
It'll be fine.

23:17.529 --> 23:19.564
- Sorry, Missy,
but in my 80 years,

23:19.598 --> 23:22.534
there's one thing I've learned.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.036
I'm a student, not a teacher.

23:27.205 --> 23:28.840
Ease it on up here.

23:33.912 --> 23:34.913
- Little ol' me?

23:34.946 --> 23:35.914
- Mm-hmm.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.816
- Okay, come on, Emily.

23:37.849 --> 23:40.051
Let's help Miss Cassie out.

23:42.554 --> 23:43.555
- Perfect.

23:43.588 --> 23:44.456
Okay.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.262
- Five, six, seven, eight.

23:50.295 --> 23:53.498
(light piano music)

24:12.150 --> 24:13.652
(laughing)

24:13.685 --> 24:16.521
(group clapping)

24:16.555 --> 24:19.157
- Um, anyway, I'm a
little rusty myself,

24:19.191 --> 24:20.158
but you guys get the idea.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.093
If that's rusty, I'm decomposed.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.862
(laughing)

24:23.895 --> 24:26.064
- All right, everybody
grab your partner

24:26.097 --> 24:28.033
and let's try it.

24:28.066 --> 24:31.069
(light piano music)

24:43.181 --> 24:44.115
- Hey, you.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.184
Hey, I just thought I'd swing by

24:46.218 --> 24:50.889
and you know, see if I
could ask you to dinner.

24:50.922 --> 24:52.090
(light orchestral music)

24:52.123 --> 24:54.659
- Um, you know, I actually
don't know if that is an option

24:54.693 --> 24:57.195
because I kind have
this other other thing.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.264
- Yeah, you can't come
up with a good excuse?

24:59.297 --> 25:00.298
- Pretty much.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.566
- Eight o'clock.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.168
- Uh, but it's not a date.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.036
It's just two people,
who've known each other

25:05.070 --> 25:06.638
since middle school,
having dinner.

25:06.671 --> 25:07.906
- Not a date.

25:07.939 --> 25:09.307
So, I'll pick you up.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.543
- No, I'll meet you there.

25:15.647 --> 25:17.682
Where are we going?

25:17.716 --> 25:19.918
- What sounds good to you?

25:19.951 --> 25:23.221
- The Clubhouse, seven
p.m., not a date.

25:27.692 --> 25:31.229
(light orchestral music)

25:39.237 --> 25:40.739
- So, how is life
in the big city?

25:40.772 --> 25:42.240
You seeing anybody?

25:42.274 --> 25:44.142
- Wow, you cut to the chase.

25:44.175 --> 25:47.245
Um, but to answer
your question, yes.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.216
- Okay.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.084
That's cool.

25:53.118 --> 25:55.086
I'm happy for you.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.955
- What about you?

25:56.988 --> 25:58.690
- Dated around a little bit,

25:58.723 --> 26:00.659
but, no, truth is,
I'm just too busy

26:00.692 --> 26:02.694
for anything serious right now.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.730
Decided it's important to be
there for Linda and Emily.

26:05.764 --> 26:08.400
At least until Linda
gets back on her feet.

26:08.433 --> 26:11.202
She was pretty devastated
after her husband left.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.339
- Oh, well, they're
really lucky to have you.

26:14.372 --> 26:17.042
- I think I'm pretty lucky too.

26:19.044 --> 26:22.314
- Is that why you
never left Georgetown?

26:23.415 --> 26:24.349
- I'm sorry.

26:24.382 --> 26:27.185
It's just, it's all
you used to talk about.

26:27.218 --> 26:28.753
- I did leave.

26:28.787 --> 26:31.723
For a little while I was
working down in Savannah.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.792
This young slick developer.

26:33.825 --> 26:35.126
- Really?

26:35.160 --> 26:37.262
- Well, I thought I was.

26:37.295 --> 26:40.298
Truth is, I was in
way over my head.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.402
Too arrogant to realize it.

26:44.436 --> 26:49.007
I ended up filing for
bankruptcy when I was 22.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.242
And then after
Linda's husband left,

26:51.276 --> 26:53.411
it seemed like a good
time for me to come back

26:53.445 --> 26:55.747
and be there for her
and get back on my feet.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.683
- You seem to be
doing very well now.

26:58.717 --> 26:59.617
- It took a few years,

26:59.651 --> 27:03.388
but I think I'm finally
on the right path.

27:06.257 --> 27:08.727
Besides, Georgetown's
where I'm meant to be.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.729
And I get to be my own boss

27:10.762 --> 27:13.765
and take off for the
important things,

27:13.798 --> 27:16.334
like ballet and Cha Cha lessons.

27:17.802 --> 27:18.870
- To friends.

27:21.272 --> 27:22.173
- Friends.

27:22.207 --> 27:25.176
(glasses clinking)

27:27.078 --> 27:27.612
- [Waitress] Here you go.

27:27.645 --> 27:28.713
Whenever you're ready.

27:28.747 --> 27:29.748
- Thank you.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.322
You wanna go for a walk?

27:37.355 --> 27:39.391
- I think we should
pay the bill first.

27:39.424 --> 27:40.325
- Yeah, probably.

27:40.358 --> 27:41.459
(laughing)

27:41.493 --> 27:43.461
Oh, I haven't dined
and dashed since,

27:43.495 --> 27:45.363
since that time
at Gator's Strike.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.464
Do you remember that?

27:46.498 --> 27:47.832
- Oh my gosh, I can't
believe you brought that up.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.235
(laughing)

27:50.268 --> 27:51.169
Oh, we'll split it.

27:51.202 --> 27:52.804
- Oh, no no no no.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.372
- Fine, but this is not a date.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.473
- Not a date, got it.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.775
Of course not.

27:56.808 --> 27:59.310
You have a boyfriend.

27:59.344 --> 28:02.747
This is supposed to
be a very good wine.

28:02.781 --> 28:05.717
(light rock music)

28:15.427 --> 28:18.296
- Look at how beautiful
it can be here at night.

28:18.329 --> 28:19.197
- Yeah.

28:20.331 --> 28:23.168
- Ah, so, I have to be honest.

28:23.201 --> 28:26.337
I had a boyfriend
until a few days ago.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.238
- I see.

28:27.939 --> 28:30.108
- Yeah, this guy names Jeffrey.

28:30.141 --> 28:32.811
I don't know what I saw in him.

28:32.844 --> 28:35.346
He dumped me on his birthday.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.381
- Wow.

28:36.414 --> 28:37.282
- Mm-hmm.

28:38.516 --> 28:40.852
- I guess that's better than
being dumped on your birthday.

28:40.885 --> 28:41.553
- This is true.

28:41.586 --> 28:44.155
(laughing)

28:45.290 --> 28:47.258
- So, what's your plan?

28:47.292 --> 28:48.126
- In life?

28:49.394 --> 28:50.829
- Yeah, I guess, but
I meant, you know,

28:50.862 --> 28:52.497
not so distant
future, here, now.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.332
- Oh, right.

28:54.365 --> 28:56.868
Well, mom should be getting
released from the hospital soon

28:56.901 --> 29:01.840
and then, well, the studio's
not doing so well financially.

29:02.841 --> 29:04.242
- I'm sorry.

29:04.275 --> 29:06.344
- Yeah, please keep
that to yourself.

29:06.377 --> 29:08.146
- Yeah, of course.

29:12.183 --> 29:14.519
- You know, maybe
it's time we started

29:14.552 --> 29:17.122
thinking outside
the box on that.

29:17.155 --> 29:18.223
- Well, we're gonna have
to think of something quick

29:18.256 --> 29:21.126
or Coastal Dance Center
will be a thing of the past.

29:21.159 --> 29:22.460
- We can't have that.

29:22.494 --> 29:23.428
(light orchestral music)

29:23.461 --> 29:25.130
- We?

29:25.163 --> 29:27.365
- That place, it means
the world to Emily.

29:27.398 --> 29:29.467
And it means a lot to me too.

29:29.501 --> 29:33.438
As they say, we're all
in this together, right?

29:35.340 --> 29:37.275
- Don't you miss it?

29:37.308 --> 29:38.343
- Miss what?

29:38.376 --> 29:39.244
- Dance.

29:42.313 --> 29:44.415
- That was then.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.184
I have a career now.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.420
- Listen, there's
something I've been meaning

29:49.454 --> 29:50.522
to apologize to you for.

29:50.555 --> 29:53.892
- Ah, there's no
need to apologize.

29:53.925 --> 29:57.395
Thank you for a wonderful
dinner and non-date.

29:57.428 --> 29:58.296
Goodnight.

- Cassie?

30:48.046 --> 30:49.447
(light orchestral music)

30:49.480 --> 30:52.417
- Walter Carlos Gaviote,
my favorite student.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.352
- Cassie, it's been forever.

30:54.385 --> 30:55.520
How's Miss Kate?

30:55.553 --> 30:57.956
- She's doing well, thank you.

30:57.989 --> 30:59.524
- That's great.

30:59.557 --> 31:00.358
- So, how have you been?

31:00.391 --> 31:02.527
Last time I saw
you you had braces.

31:02.560 --> 31:03.628
- Good.

31:03.661 --> 31:05.330
I've been applying to a
bunch of different colleges

31:05.363 --> 31:06.664
and, but, listen,

31:08.466 --> 31:12.403
Victor told me he was
leaving and I wanna help.

31:13.404 --> 31:16.975
I might could cover some
of his ballroom classes?

31:17.008 --> 31:19.544
- That's so sweet, but
business hasn't been so great.

31:19.577 --> 31:21.412
- You need a ballroom
instructor, right?

31:21.446 --> 31:23.014
- Well, yeah.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.582
- Look, my parents
got me covered.

31:24.616 --> 31:27.385
I'll teach a couple classes
and when things get better,

31:27.418 --> 31:28.987
we'll talk, cool?

31:30.421 --> 31:31.322
- Thank you.

31:31.356 --> 31:32.390
(light orchestral music)

31:32.423 --> 31:34.425
It's so good to see you.

31:38.596 --> 31:40.398
- You hired Walter?

31:40.431 --> 31:41.432
- Is that a problem?

31:41.466 --> 31:43.268
- He's like 12 years old.

31:43.301 --> 31:44.402
How do you intend to pay him?

31:44.435 --> 31:45.370
- We worked it out.

31:45.403 --> 31:48.539
- Look, this kid you
have so much faith in,

31:48.573 --> 31:51.042
represents what's
wrong with the studio.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.411
He may be young,
but he's old-school.

31:53.444 --> 31:56.481
All he knows is
traditional dance.

31:56.514 --> 31:58.683
We need fresh blood.

31:58.716 --> 32:01.085
- I thought that was
why you were here.

32:01.119 --> 32:04.555
Listen, Walter can
teach old-school ballet

32:04.589 --> 32:08.660
and you can teach contemporary
and get your hip hop on.

32:08.693 --> 32:11.629
Roxy, it's the best
of both worlds.

32:37.055 --> 32:38.623
Where did all these
people come from?

32:38.656 --> 32:40.458
- I posted on
Instagram and Snapchat

32:40.491 --> 32:42.593
that I was gonna be teaching

32:42.627 --> 32:46.397
and if you excuse me,
I have some work to do.

32:54.505 --> 32:55.340
See you next week.

32:55.373 --> 32:56.708
- [Girl] Thank you.

33:00.378 --> 33:02.547
- This is impressive.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.416
- Well, that should help out
with some of the bills, yeah?

33:05.450 --> 33:06.784
- It's a start.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.052
- Do you have a second?

33:08.086 --> 33:08.753
- Yeah.

33:11.823 --> 33:16.060
- Have you heard of the
new Southern Regionals?

33:16.094 --> 33:20.531
It's held each May and
there's like 10,000 in prizes.

33:20.565 --> 33:22.500
- That would make
the bank happy,

33:22.533 --> 33:24.469
but that's like a month away.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.303
- So?

33:25.336 --> 33:28.539
- Who would
represent the studio?

33:28.573 --> 33:29.474
Oh, no.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.442
I haven't danced at
that level in years.

33:31.476 --> 33:32.643
- Come on, dude.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.178
How many titles do you have?

33:34.212 --> 33:35.113
- I don't know.

33:35.146 --> 33:37.448
And who would I partner with?

33:38.616 --> 33:39.751
(laughing)

33:39.784 --> 33:42.487
- Besides, none of the other
studios are as good as us

33:42.520 --> 33:45.423
and when we win, people
will be lining up

33:45.456 --> 33:47.525
to take lessons with us.

33:47.558 --> 33:49.394
- Victor will probably be there.

33:49.427 --> 33:50.428
- Counting on it.

33:50.461 --> 33:53.498
(light pop music)

34:18.189 --> 34:20.425
(door chimes ringing)

34:20.458 --> 34:21.092
(light classical music)

34:21.125 --> 34:23.594
- And step left, step right,

34:24.462 --> 34:25.463
and jump.

34:32.470 --> 34:34.472
Jump, and oh, ow.

34:34.505 --> 34:35.540
Ooh.

34:37.508 --> 34:42.447
(laughing)
(light orchestral music)

34:42.480 --> 34:43.114
Oooh.

34:43.147 --> 34:44.582
- Are you okay, Uncle Dean?

34:44.615 --> 34:45.850
- Yeah, I'm okay.

34:45.883 --> 34:47.752
Just fine, sweetheart.

34:48.953 --> 34:51.222
- What is all this?

34:51.255 --> 34:55.159
- It's father-daughter or
uncle dance appreciation day.

34:55.193 --> 34:57.462
- How cute is that?

34:57.495 --> 34:58.429
Nice tutu.

34:58.463 --> 35:00.698
Pink would not have
been my first choice.

35:00.731 --> 35:02.467
I think you're more
of a winter palette.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.401
- I don't know.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.603
Pretty fond of pink,
thank you very much.

35:05.636 --> 35:07.171
- You sure you're okay?

35:07.205 --> 35:08.739
- Yeah, just my ego.

35:10.308 --> 35:12.810
- Well, in that case,
I have to go rehearse.

35:12.844 --> 35:13.778
- Oh, yeah?

35:14.979 --> 35:16.614
- It's a secret.

35:18.816 --> 35:19.684
- Hmmm.

35:20.785 --> 35:25.523
I don't think she should
be keeping secrets from us.

35:25.556 --> 35:27.525
We can keep a secret, can't we?

35:27.558 --> 35:28.059
- Yeah.

35:28.092 --> 35:28.759
- Yeah, I think so.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.496
- Especially a big juicy secret.

35:31.529 --> 35:35.500
(light orchestral music)

35:35.533 --> 35:36.701
- Hi.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.503
I brought contraband.

35:38.536 --> 35:39.036
- Oh, yay.

35:40.938 --> 35:42.306
- I hope you're hungry.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.274
- Oh, I am.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.511
What'd you bring me?

35:46.544 --> 35:47.945
- It's a surprise.

35:48.913 --> 35:50.248
Here you go.

35:50.281 --> 35:50.948
Mmm mmm.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.518
Looky here, looky here.

35:53.551 --> 35:54.585
(gasping)

35:54.619 --> 35:55.786
- Oh.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.921
That looks good.

35:56.954 --> 35:58.256
- Come on, let's dig in.

35:58.289 --> 35:59.724
- How are we doing today?

35:59.757 --> 36:00.625
(light orchestral music)

36:00.658 --> 36:02.660
- Ah, much better now.

36:02.693 --> 36:03.794
(laughing)

36:03.828 --> 36:05.530
- Would you like
some pulled pork?

36:05.563 --> 36:06.664
(laughing)

36:06.697 --> 36:07.665
- I'm a vegan.

36:07.698 --> 36:09.233
- Oh, we've got corn.

36:09.267 --> 36:10.268
Come on, dig in.

36:10.301 --> 36:12.336
(laughing)

36:13.704 --> 36:14.839
- Tango?

36:14.872 --> 36:15.873
- Tango.

36:15.907 --> 36:16.941
- Tango?

36:16.974 --> 36:18.676
- Is there an echo?

36:19.810 --> 36:22.780
It's all about connecting
with the music,

36:22.813 --> 36:24.849
connecting with the audience.

36:24.882 --> 36:27.318
Drama, passion, synchronicity.

36:30.655 --> 36:31.822
- I'm impressed.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.559
- Our moves are
stealth like a cat,

36:34.592 --> 36:36.227
poised and confident.

36:37.295 --> 36:38.362
Let's try it.

36:38.396 --> 36:39.830
(tango music)

36:39.864 --> 36:41.866
Five, six, seven, eight.

36:44.068 --> 36:45.303
And--

36:45.336 --> 36:46.571
- Oh, sorry.

36:46.604 --> 36:49.574
(phone ringing)

36:49.607 --> 36:50.641
Hello?

36:51.976 --> 36:53.678
Oh, yeah, I'll be right there.

36:53.711 --> 36:54.412
Thank you.

36:55.980 --> 36:56.847
Um, I gotta go, I'm sorry.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.916
- Oh, is everything okay?

36:58.950 --> 37:01.852
- Yeah, my mom's being
released from the hospital.

37:01.886 --> 37:02.687
- [Walter] Nice.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.754
Okay.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

37:03.788 --> 37:04.655
Bye.

37:08.693 --> 37:10.294
- Now, she needs plenty of rest.

37:10.328 --> 37:12.363
The nurse will give
you instructions

37:12.396 --> 37:14.699
as well as modifications
for her diet, okay?

37:14.732 --> 37:16.567
- Okay.

37:16.601 --> 37:19.303
- So, the most important thing
is she needs to take it easy.

37:19.337 --> 37:21.839
Her body still needs to heal.

37:21.872 --> 37:23.407
- That'll be tough.

37:24.609 --> 37:26.344
She doesn't really like
others taking care of her.

37:26.377 --> 37:28.579
- I'm sure she'll
enjoy a little TLC.

37:28.613 --> 37:29.981
- We'll see about that.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.849
- We'll see about what?

37:31.882 --> 37:32.717
- Oh, hey, mom.

37:32.750 --> 37:33.618
Are you ready to go home?

37:33.651 --> 37:34.885
- Indeed, I am.

37:34.919 --> 37:35.953
Chop chop.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.588
- [Nurse] Yes, ma'am.

37:37.622 --> 37:38.656
- Miss Kate, you take
care of yourself.

37:38.689 --> 37:40.024
- Thank you, doc.

37:40.057 --> 37:40.958
(light orchestral music)

37:40.992 --> 37:41.859
Let's get moving.

37:41.892 --> 37:43.394
- Let's get home.

37:56.641 --> 37:58.776
(kissing)

38:11.455 --> 38:13.758
- Shouldn't you be
home with your momma?

38:13.791 --> 38:14.659
- She kicked me out.

38:14.692 --> 38:15.693
(laughing)

38:15.726 --> 38:16.894
- Doesn't surprise me.

38:16.927 --> 38:20.031
I'll be sure to go by and see
her later, if that's okay.

38:20.064 --> 38:20.931
- Thank you.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.366
That would be so sweet.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.801
- Oh, can I get you something?

38:23.834 --> 38:25.136
It's on me.

38:25.169 --> 38:27.071
- Um, maybe just some soup.

38:27.104 --> 38:28.939
- Coming right up.

38:28.973 --> 38:29.974
- Thank you.

38:34.412 --> 38:35.913
Hey, it's me.

38:35.946 --> 38:36.781
Call me when you get this.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.849
(door chimes ringing)

38:38.883 --> 38:40.818
(light orchestral music)

38:40.851 --> 38:41.719
- Cassie?

38:44.088 --> 38:45.389
- Uh, hi, yes.

38:45.423 --> 38:46.457
- I'm Amber.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.124
Remember?

38:47.158 --> 38:47.925
(wind rushing)

38:47.958 --> 38:48.859
You're a day late,
a dollar short,

38:48.893 --> 38:52.163
and way out of your
league, little miss.

38:52.196 --> 38:53.397
- Oh, Amber.

38:54.432 --> 38:55.733
Of course.

38:55.766 --> 38:56.934
How are you?

38:56.967 --> 38:57.802
- I'm good.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.437
I'm just meeting a
friend for dinner.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.806
So, what brings you to town?

39:01.839 --> 39:04.875
- Um, I'm just visiting my mom.

39:04.909 --> 39:06.110
- That's great.

39:07.044 --> 39:09.680
- Yeah, you look really good.

39:09.714 --> 39:10.848
- Thank you.

39:10.881 --> 39:12.750
Oh, so do you.

39:12.783 --> 39:13.784
- Thank you.

39:14.785 --> 39:15.853
- [Marsha] Here you go.

39:15.886 --> 39:16.754
- [Cassie] Oh, thank you.

39:16.787 --> 39:17.321
- Oh, hey, Amber.

39:17.354 --> 39:18.489
Can I get you something?

39:18.522 --> 39:19.156
- Oh, no.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.191
I'm good for now, thanks.

39:20.224 --> 39:22.426
- [Marsha] Okay.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.795
- So, I heard you
and Dean had dinner.

39:24.829 --> 39:25.963
- Yes, we did.

39:27.064 --> 39:28.833
- Well, that's nice.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.835
It sure is good to catch up.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.103
You know, I'm very proud
of him for bouncing back

39:32.136 --> 39:33.804
like he did.

39:33.838 --> 39:37.041
And between you and me, he
should've never left town.

39:37.074 --> 39:38.476
But he's back now.

39:38.509 --> 39:40.778
That's all that matters.

39:40.811 --> 39:41.712
(door chimes ringing)

39:41.746 --> 39:42.513
- So, are you and he--

39:42.546 --> 39:43.481
- Oh, hey, there she is.

39:43.514 --> 39:46.450
I gotta run, but it
was so good to see you.

39:46.484 --> 39:47.151
- You too.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.158
(wind rushing)

39:54.191 --> 39:57.194
(light piano music)

40:00.264 --> 40:01.799
- Hey, you two.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.536
I gotta lock up for the night.

40:05.569 --> 40:06.237
- Okay, Miss Kate.

40:06.270 --> 40:07.805
Thank you.

40:07.838 --> 40:08.739
- Be right out.

40:08.773 --> 40:09.507
- Okay.

40:11.208 --> 40:14.512
(wind rushing)

40:14.545 --> 40:16.981
- [Marsha] More coffee?

40:17.014 --> 40:18.249
- I'm sorry, what?

40:18.282 --> 40:20.084
- More coffee, honey?

40:20.117 --> 40:21.018
- Oh, yes.

40:21.051 --> 40:21.919

- Sounds good.

41:40.865 --> 41:43.200
(clapping)

41:43.234 --> 41:44.668
- Very nice moves.

41:46.270 --> 41:47.271
- Thanks.

41:47.304 --> 41:48.105
How can I help you?

41:48.138 --> 41:51.208
- May I have a
moment of your time?

41:52.276 --> 41:53.911
Hadley Prescott.

41:53.944 --> 41:54.745
(dramatic orchestral music)

41:54.778 --> 41:57.648
And you must be Miss
Kate's daughter.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.583
- I'm Cassie, yes.

41:59.617 --> 42:01.318
- I've met with your
mother on several occasions

42:01.352 --> 42:02.553
in the past.

42:03.721 --> 42:07.091
I've also been told that she
had a recent health scare.

42:07.124 --> 42:09.293
I hope she's en route
to a speedy recovery.

42:09.326 --> 42:11.061
- Thank you.

42:11.095 --> 42:12.363
Continue.

42:12.396 --> 42:14.164
- Now, I'm also aware
of the challenges

42:14.198 --> 42:16.667
that the studio has been facing.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.603
I discussed buying the
building from your mother.

42:19.637 --> 42:21.605
- And I'm sure she wanted
to hear nothing about it.

42:21.639 --> 42:24.608
(laughing)

42:24.642 --> 42:26.877
- Yeah, that pretty
much sums it up.

42:26.911 --> 42:30.648
- So, what would you be
planning to do with the building

42:30.681 --> 42:32.182
if you buy it?

42:32.216 --> 42:35.686
- I can't say specifically,
but my associates and I,

42:35.719 --> 42:38.989
we have a gameplan
for these parts.

42:39.023 --> 42:41.292
- And would you consider
leasing it back to us?

42:41.325 --> 42:42.426
- Out of the question.

42:42.459 --> 42:45.262
But we are willing to pay
off your mortgage default

42:45.296 --> 42:48.232
so you all can move
on and be debt free.

42:48.265 --> 42:49.266
It's a win-win.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.035
- Win-win.

42:51.068 --> 42:54.305
So, you're telling
me that this studio,

42:55.239 --> 42:57.241
this piece of the community

42:57.274 --> 43:00.177
that's been in my family
since before I was born,

43:00.210 --> 43:03.280
is only worth its
outstanding mortgage?

43:03.314 --> 43:05.316
- Now, I wouldn't put
it exactly that way.

43:05.349 --> 43:07.318
- Well, however you wanna
spin it, Mr. Prescott.

43:07.351 --> 43:09.186
- Please, call me Hadley.

43:09.219 --> 43:13.390
- Actually, I don't think
I'll be calling you at all.

43:15.225 --> 43:17.227
Please see yourself out.

44:06.043 --> 44:09.046
- [Walter] Whoa,
this is so awesome!

44:11.749 --> 44:15.786
Hey, guys, take a picture
of me for my Instagram.

44:23.394 --> 44:25.329
(light piano music)

44:25.362 --> 44:26.230
- Hips in.

44:27.431 --> 44:29.733
Hold your, hold your arms up

44:32.436 --> 44:33.303
and stay.

44:35.472 --> 44:37.341
Chest open, lifted up.

44:40.044 --> 44:41.045
Good, all right.

44:41.078 --> 44:42.046
Let's try it again.

44:42.079 --> 44:42.713
Hey, Cassie.

44:42.746 --> 44:43.414
How are you?
- Hi, good.

44:43.447 --> 44:44.448
How are you?

44:44.481 --> 44:45.315
- Good.

44:45.349 --> 44:46.417
How's your mom?

44:46.450 --> 44:48.118
- She's recovering.

44:48.152 --> 44:49.319
You know how stubborn she is.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.522
- Yes, I know how your mom is.

44:51.555 --> 44:53.390
But now I have to
deal with Roxy.

44:53.424 --> 44:54.525
(laughing)

44:54.558 --> 44:56.427
- Yeah, Roxy can
be bossy sometimes,

44:56.460 --> 44:58.429
but she's been really
great to step in

44:58.462 --> 44:59.463
while my mom's been out,

44:59.496 --> 45:00.464
and you guys have to.

45:00.497 --> 45:01.265
(dramatic orchestral music)

45:01.298 --> 45:02.266
I know it's been
tough around here.

45:02.299 --> 45:04.368
- You know, you and your
mom are so good to me

45:04.401 --> 45:06.804
and the kids, so
don't worry about it.

45:06.837 --> 45:07.504
- Thank you.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.639
You guys have been amazing.

45:08.672 --> 45:11.308
- So, I heard you're going
to the dance competition?

45:11.341 --> 45:13.177
- Yeah, scary, huh?

45:14.311 --> 45:16.146
- So, you need any help?

45:16.180 --> 45:18.482
- Yeah, I could use all
the help I could get.

45:18.515 --> 45:19.383
- Any time.

45:19.416 --> 45:20.384
- You guys get back to work.

45:20.417 --> 45:21.418
- All right.

45:21.452 --> 45:22.286
- Bye.
- Bye.

45:22.319 --> 45:24.321
All right, try it again.

you wanna tell me?

Listen, if you two
are still dating,

48:57.534 --> 48:59.536
that's your thing.

48:59.569 --> 49:01.772
I just know why
you didn't tell me.

49:01.805 --> 49:03.573
What else are you
not telling me?

49:03.607 --> 49:04.608
- Not telling you?

49:04.641 --> 49:08.245
Look, I have been
completely honest with you.

49:08.278 --> 49:09.179
You know what?

49:09.212 --> 49:11.381
I don't owe you an
explanation about that.

49:11.415 --> 49:13.483
You're the one who left
Georgetown and never came back

49:13.517 --> 49:16.687
and pretty soon, you're
gonna leave again

49:18.388 --> 49:20.691
and none of this ever mattered.

49:23.360 --> 49:24.061
Cassie, wait.

49:24.094 --> 49:25.028
I didn't...

49:30.567 --> 49:32.336
(sighing)

49:32.369 --> 49:34.805
- What was that all about?

49:34.838 --> 49:37.541
- I just, I wanna focus
on the competition

49:37.574 --> 49:38.709
and getting my mom
back on her feet.

49:38.742 --> 49:40.377
(door chimes ringing)

49:40.410 --> 49:41.545
What happened?

49:42.546 --> 49:44.414
- Skydiving incident.

49:44.448 --> 49:46.450
- [Roxy] Skydiving.

49:46.483 --> 49:48.452
- Oh, it was great.

49:48.485 --> 49:49.453
We had a blast

49:50.420 --> 49:52.556
until I tripped and
fell in the parking lot

49:52.589 --> 49:54.057
on the way home.

49:55.559 --> 49:57.561
There's no way we'll
be ready in time.

49:57.594 --> 49:58.462
- Oh no.

50:00.564 --> 50:02.466
- I'm really sorry.

50:02.499 --> 50:03.834
- It's fine.

50:03.867 --> 50:06.570
- What are we gonna do?

50:06.603 --> 50:08.438
- We're gonna have to pull
out of the competition.

50:08.472 --> 50:09.706
- Let me coach you.

50:09.740 --> 50:10.774
You've been doing really good

50:10.807 --> 50:13.443
and I'm sure we could
find you another partner.

50:13.477 --> 50:15.846
- How are we gonna find a
new partner in two weeks?

50:15.879 --> 50:17.547
- [Dean] All you
had to do was ask.

50:17.581 --> 50:20.083
(light orchestral music)

50:20.117 --> 50:21.551
- Absolutely not.

50:21.585 --> 50:22.586
- Cassie, I'm sorry.

50:22.619 --> 50:23.453
If you just let me--

50:23.487 --> 50:24.521
- Listen.

50:25.489 --> 50:26.656
You broke my trust.

50:26.690 --> 50:27.657
I don't want your apology.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.493
- Please, listen to me
for one second, okay?

50:29.526 --> 50:30.494
- I can't deal with
this right now.

50:30.527 --> 50:31.428
- Cassie.

50:31.461 --> 50:33.463
- I have too many
things to worry about.

50:33.497 --> 50:35.799
- All I ever wanted
to do was help,

50:35.832 --> 50:38.535
just give back to the studio.

50:46.443 --> 50:47.411
- Don't.

50:47.444 --> 50:50.680
- Sometimes we have to
put the past behind us,

50:50.714 --> 50:52.482
let it go.

50:52.516 --> 50:54.384
- This is just a job to you.

50:54.418 --> 50:56.520
And when this is gone,
you can find another one.

50:56.553 --> 50:58.555
- You're wrong.

50:58.588 --> 51:00.624
This is so much more than a job.

51:00.657 --> 51:02.592
Dance is what I love.

51:02.626 --> 51:03.860
I love this place.

51:05.662 --> 51:08.532
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

51:09.599 --> 51:12.669
Look, we may not see eye to eye,

51:12.702 --> 51:15.472
but I only know one thing.

51:15.505 --> 51:17.641
You are a talented dancer.

51:18.675 --> 51:21.645
And I also know you're
quite fond of someone,

51:21.678 --> 51:25.549
just by how you keep
telling yourself otherwise.

51:25.582 --> 51:27.384
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

51:27.417 --> 51:28.418
- You don't?

51:30.420 --> 51:31.621
- You stay out of this.

51:31.655 --> 51:34.624
- Now, it's your turn to shine,
do some good for the studio.

51:34.658 --> 51:37.694
I'm happy to work with you
and Walter if you'll have me,

51:37.727 --> 51:39.930
help you get ready
for the competition.

51:39.963 --> 51:42.165
- Are you sure about that?

51:42.199 --> 51:43.567
- On one condition.

51:43.600 --> 51:44.935
- Oh, here it comes.

51:44.968 --> 51:47.537
- Please kiss and
make up with Dean.

51:47.571 --> 51:48.638
- I concur.

51:49.506 --> 51:50.807
- You two are incorrigible.

51:50.841 --> 51:51.942
- It's settled then.

51:51.975 --> 51:52.843
- I didn't say that.

51:52.876 --> 51:55.679
- Come, Walter, we
have to strategize.

51:55.712 --> 51:57.914
(light orchestral music)

51:57.948 --> 52:00.684
(laughing)

52:00.717 --> 52:01.585
Oooh.

52:09.559 --> 52:11.528
(sighing)

52:13.463 --> 52:14.631
(sighing)

52:14.664 --> 52:15.532
- Hi.

52:17.834 --> 52:18.702
- Hi.

52:21.538 --> 52:22.572
Shall we?

52:23.640 --> 52:24.508
- Dance?

52:26.610 --> 52:29.813
(light orchestral music)

52:42.025 --> 52:43.193
- Let's go.

52:43.960 --> 52:46.796
- What are you two doing here?

52:46.830 --> 52:48.865
- Oh, uh, we just
wanted to check in

52:48.899 --> 52:50.834
and see how you were doing.

52:50.867 --> 52:51.735
- Good morning.

52:51.768 --> 52:52.636
(throat clearing)

52:52.669 --> 52:53.537
Afternoon.

52:54.905 --> 52:56.673
- Hey, Miss Kate.

52:56.706 --> 52:58.542
- Hello, Dean.

52:58.575 --> 52:59.609
- Dean and I are
gonna be competing

52:59.643 --> 53:01.645
in the Souther Regionals.

53:01.678 --> 53:03.580
- Then what are you doing here?

53:03.613 --> 53:04.814
Ya'll need to rehearse.

53:04.848 --> 53:06.283
Now get.

53:06.316 --> 53:07.551
- Mom.

53:07.584 --> 53:08.618
- I ain't dead yet.

53:08.652 --> 53:10.887
(coughing)

53:12.522 --> 53:15.692
(light orchestral music)

53:16.760 --> 53:18.628
I'm fine.

53:18.662 --> 53:20.897
Just need to take it easy.

53:20.931 --> 53:22.566
Now, outta here.

53:23.500 --> 53:25.268
- I can stay for a little while.

53:25.302 --> 53:26.903
They're covering for
me at the restaurant.

53:26.937 --> 53:27.804
- Thank you, Marsha.

53:27.837 --> 53:28.939
- You all worry too much.

53:28.972 --> 53:30.740
I don't need a babysitter,

53:30.774 --> 53:32.742
just some sleep.

53:32.776 --> 53:33.877
Everyone out.

53:34.878 --> 53:35.745
Go.

53:35.779 --> 53:36.613
- I love you.

53:36.646 --> 53:38.615
- I love you too.

53:38.648 --> 53:39.816
- Take care, Miss Kate.

53:39.849 --> 53:41.318
- So long, Dean.

53:50.594 --> 53:54.531
- For the record, Amber and
I, we did date for a while

53:54.564 --> 53:55.799
after high school.

53:55.832 --> 53:58.501
We even did the long-distance
thing when I was in Savannah.

53:58.535 --> 53:59.703
(light orchestral music)

53:59.736 --> 54:04.941
But then my business fell
apart, she started ignoring me.

54:04.975 --> 54:07.544
Wouldn't even take my call.

54:10.614 --> 54:12.549
Now that I'm finally
back on my feet,

54:12.582 --> 54:13.917
guess I'm worthy.

54:15.819 --> 54:16.686
- And?

54:20.090 --> 54:23.059
(car door opening)

54:24.594 --> 54:27.564
(car door closing)

54:32.836 --> 54:36.573
Do you have any idea
how much you hurt me?

54:38.375 --> 54:42.712
I mean, I know it was high
school but it still hurts.

54:43.847 --> 54:45.081
We were great together

54:45.115 --> 54:47.617
and then you chose the
bottled-blonde hotty

54:47.651 --> 54:49.653
to impress your friends.

54:55.392 --> 54:57.594
I really cared about you.

54:58.662 --> 54:59.763
- I know you did

55:01.698 --> 55:02.632
and I can't tell
you how many times

55:02.666 --> 55:05.835
I wanted to pick up
the phone and call you.

55:05.869 --> 55:07.404
- Why didn't you?

55:08.071 --> 55:10.640
- I was a teenage boy

55:10.674 --> 55:12.342
with a fragile ego.

55:15.412 --> 55:18.982
Why did you really
leave Georgetown?

55:19.015 --> 55:20.583
- To start my career.

55:20.617 --> 55:22.752
- Cassie, you are the best
dancer I've ever known

55:22.786 --> 55:25.622
and you went off and you got
a corporate nine to five.

55:25.655 --> 55:29.859
I get it, it's safe, but
there's no risk there.

55:29.893 --> 55:32.128
There's no reward either.

55:32.162 --> 55:33.663
- I got promoted.

55:35.799 --> 55:38.668
- We can only lie to
ourselves for so long.

55:38.702 --> 55:39.736
Wouldn't you rather try and fail

55:39.769 --> 55:41.938
than never try at all?

55:41.971 --> 55:44.941
(sighing)

55:44.974 --> 55:47.644
(car starting)

55:54.451 --> 55:56.653
- Your timing is impeccable.

55:56.686 --> 55:58.621
- I put this off for
as long as I could,

55:58.655 --> 56:00.690
but the board is
breathing down my neck.

56:00.724 --> 56:01.825
- The board or a vulture,

56:01.858 --> 56:05.862
wanting to swoop in when
we're at our most vulnerable?

56:05.895 --> 56:06.896
- You know if the bank moves in,

56:06.930 --> 56:08.131
it'll be far worse for you

56:08.164 --> 56:10.633
than if you accept
our generous offer.

56:10.667 --> 56:12.902
- Paying off our mortgage
and leaving us with nothing

56:12.936 --> 56:15.105
is far from generous.

56:15.138 --> 56:17.707
- It'll save you all the
humiliation of foreclosure.

56:17.741 --> 56:19.042
And knowing we
acquired your property

56:19.075 --> 56:21.044
for even less than
we're offering now.

56:21.077 --> 56:22.245
(light orchestral music)

56:22.278 --> 56:25.215
- You might wanna work on your
bedside manner, my friend.

56:25.248 --> 56:27.050
- Duly noted.

56:27.083 --> 56:29.686
- Cassie, I would
stop this if I could,

56:29.719 --> 56:32.655
but I've put this
off for far too long.

56:32.689 --> 56:34.724
- My dance partner, Dean,
and I are gonna be competing

56:34.758 --> 56:35.825
in the Southern Regionals.

56:35.859 --> 56:38.928
It's $10,000 for the winner.

56:38.962 --> 56:40.463
And all of that would
go to the studio

56:40.497 --> 56:42.065
and the business has
actually been getting--

56:42.098 --> 56:44.934
- Yeah, but that's if you win.

56:44.968 --> 56:47.737
- I have the utmost
faith in you ability,

56:47.771 --> 56:50.807
but that is hardly something
I can take back to the board.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.843
The $10,000 will merely
delay the foreclosure.

56:53.877 --> 56:55.945
You'll need to show some
substantial business growth

56:55.979 --> 56:58.715
for the bank to reconsider.

56:58.748 --> 57:00.116
- Is he giving you
a hefty commission?

57:00.150 --> 57:01.017
(laughing)

57:01.050 --> 57:01.951
- [William] Come on now.

57:01.985 --> 57:02.819
- Well is he?

57:02.852 --> 57:03.686
- Cassie.

57:03.720 --> 57:04.854
- Looks, it's true.

57:04.888 --> 57:07.223
I want the property, but I
haven't exerted any pressure

57:07.257 --> 57:10.693
or offered any incentives
to Mr. William.

57:10.727 --> 57:13.963
- Why don't I believe
either of you?

57:13.997 --> 57:16.166
(phone ringing)

57:16.199 --> 57:17.066
I have to take this call.

57:17.100 --> 57:17.967
Excuse me.

57:19.135 --> 57:20.837
- If you're not even willing
to consider Mr. Hadley's--

57:20.870 --> 57:23.206
- I said I have to take this.

57:23.239 --> 57:25.241
(dramatic orchestral music)

57:25.275 --> 57:26.176
- Let's go.

57:38.221 --> 57:39.756
- [Dean] More bad news?

57:39.789 --> 57:40.824
- When it rains.

57:40.857 --> 57:42.258
(door chimes ringing)

57:42.292 --> 57:43.526
(light orchestral music)

57:43.560 --> 57:45.128
- Hi, Tessa.

57:45.161 --> 57:46.162
- Hi.

57:46.196 --> 57:47.063
- Hey.

57:47.964 --> 57:48.832
- Hi.

57:50.033 --> 57:51.067
I made it.

57:51.100 --> 57:54.170
The director of the Miami
City Ballet loved me.

57:54.204 --> 57:55.004
- [Cassie] I'm so proud of you.

57:55.038 --> 57:57.140
- Thank you, but
Roger didn't make it

57:57.173 --> 57:59.175
and then he broke up with me.

57:59.209 --> 58:00.510
- Oh, I'm sorry.

58:01.778 --> 58:03.179
- Milkshake?

58:03.213 --> 58:04.747
Always makes my
niece feel better.

58:04.781 --> 58:05.315
My treat.

58:05.348 --> 58:06.883
Got lots to talk about.

58:06.916 --> 58:07.984
- Yeah, that sounds great.

58:08.017 --> 58:08.885
Let's go.

58:09.819 --> 58:11.187
- [Dean] Come on.

58:12.789 --> 58:15.191
(tango music)

58:16.926 --> 58:18.561
- [Walter] Stop.

58:18.595 --> 58:19.362
- What's wrong?

58:19.395 --> 58:20.563
- [Walter] You're
not feeling it.

58:20.597 --> 58:21.264
- [Dean] Not feeling what?

58:21.297 --> 58:23.800
- The passion, the intensity.

58:23.833 --> 58:25.301
You guys have the choreography.

58:25.335 --> 58:27.570
Just make it come to life.

58:27.604 --> 58:29.239
Let's try it again.

58:30.173 --> 58:31.040
(tango music)

58:31.074 --> 58:33.176
five, six, seven, eight.

58:33.209 --> 58:34.043
Come on, guys.

58:34.077 --> 58:34.978
Feed off each other.

58:35.011 --> 58:35.879
Come on.

58:35.912 --> 58:37.313
Stop stop stop stop stop.

58:37.347 --> 58:38.481
- Hey, guys.

58:38.514 --> 58:39.482
I actually do have a couple
of really great exercises

58:39.515 --> 58:44.287
that might help, if you
wanna give them a try.

58:44.320 --> 58:45.588
But I don't wanna
step on any toes.

58:45.622 --> 58:46.389
(light orchestral music)

58:46.422 --> 58:47.323
- Why don't we
just take a break?

58:47.357 --> 58:48.291
- No no no.

58:48.324 --> 58:49.826
Let's do this.

58:51.394 --> 58:52.262
- Okay.

58:53.296 --> 58:55.098
Step closer together.

58:56.232 --> 58:57.100
Closer.

58:58.835 --> 59:01.237
Now gaze into each other's eyes.

59:01.271 --> 59:05.842
Whoever laughs first has to
buy me another milkshake.

59:11.848 --> 59:14.250
(tango music)

59:18.087 --> 59:20.857
- And five, six, seven, eight.

59:47.884 --> 59:50.620
(phone ringing)

59:53.289 --> 59:54.157
- Hello?

59:55.892 --> 59:57.026
Where are you?

59:57.894 --> 59:59.062
- I'm sorry.

59:59.095 --> 1:00:02.098
(light piano music)

1:00:03.032 --> 1:00:05.168
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1:00:07.904 --> 1:00:09.272
I'm sorry I wasn't smart enough

1:00:09.305 --> 1:00:12.408
to realize we had a good thing.

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:15.645
And I'm sorry it
took me over 10 years

1:00:17.413 --> 1:00:19.682
to finally tell you that.

1:00:25.922 --> 1:00:26.422
Shall we?

1:00:29.359 --> 1:00:31.027
- Dance.

1:00:31.060 --> 1:00:33.663
(tango music)

1:00:38.034 --> 1:00:38.901
- [Walter] Hola.

1:00:38.935 --> 1:00:41.371
(gasping)

1:00:41.404 --> 1:00:42.271
- Uh, hi.

1:00:44.007 --> 1:00:45.308
- Looking good.

1:00:45.341 --> 1:00:47.343
We have some work to do.

1:00:47.377 --> 1:00:49.278
- Whatever you say, hotshot.

1:00:49.312 --> 1:00:51.447
- You're on, old man.

You do your thing.

(light orchestral music)

1:02:48.164 --> 1:02:50.566
- [Dean] What's she doing here?

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:53.302

- Hi.

1:03:04.547 --> 1:03:06.249
- Yes, Charlotte, please.

- Sorry to bother you, but
our dressing room is locked.

- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:03:09.085 --> 1:03:10.019
Just give me a minute, okay?

1:03:10.052 --> 1:03:11.053

I'll bring them right back.

1:03:12.188 --> 1:03:13.122

1:03:30.907 --> 1:03:31.974
- I just know
you're going to win.

1:03:32.008 --> 1:03:34.577
- Well, you know, you're
supposed to say break a leg.

1:03:34.610 --> 1:03:36.212
- Why would I say that?

1:03:36.245 --> 1:03:38.447
- Do you know what
a superstition is?

1:03:38.481 --> 1:03:39.348
- I think so.

1:03:39.382 --> 1:03:40.483
- Well, you say break a leg

1:03:40.516 --> 1:03:43.085
because it's exactly what
you don't want to happen.

1:03:43.119 --> 1:03:44.453
- I think you're
playing a trick on me.

1:03:44.487 --> 1:03:45.254
- No, that's honey.

1:03:45.288 --> 1:03:47.089
That's what you're
supposed to say.

1:03:47.123 --> 1:03:49.458

a leg, Uncle Dean.

these two finish getting ready.

1:03:53.229 --> 1:03:54.130
Bye.

1:04:05.508 --> 1:04:06.509
- Um.

1:04:08.444 --> 1:04:09.478
- Oh.

1:04:09.512 --> 1:04:11.447
- Yeah, okay, I'll
be right back.

1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:14.083
- Uh, could we use a paper clip?

1:04:14.116 --> 1:04:16.552

would look great.

and burning in Savannah,

1:06:18.341 --> 1:06:19.675
I learned some fancy moves.

1:06:19.709 --> 1:06:22.378
Thought it would impress you.

1:06:23.446 --> 1:06:26.482
Hey, I hate to ask, but do
you have any safety pins?

1:06:26.515 --> 1:06:28.617
- I might have some
in my dressing room?

1:06:28.651 --> 1:06:30.486

1:06:30.519 --> 1:06:31.487

Hey.

truly beautiful to watch.

1:16:28.216 --> 1:16:29.451
I have never--

1:16:29.484 --> 1:16:33.322
- I'm glad you enjoyed it, but
I wanna know why you're here.

1:16:33.355 --> 1:16:37.826
- To answer your question,
yes, I convinced her to sell.

1:16:37.859 --> 1:16:38.994
- Mom, no.

1:16:39.027 --> 1:16:40.195
We won.

1:16:40.228 --> 1:16:40.862
We could at least--

1:16:40.896 --> 1:16:42.998
- [Kate] Let the man speak.

1:16:43.031 --> 1:16:45.901
- Let's just say my
new investment partner

1:16:45.934 --> 1:16:47.402
is very passionate about dance.

1:16:47.436 --> 1:16:48.370
(light orchestral music)

1:16:48.403 --> 1:16:51.974
We're paying off your
mortgage, plus 20%,

1:16:52.007 --> 1:16:54.943
which you can use for
renovations how ya'll see fit

1:16:54.977 --> 1:16:58.180
and go ahead and spend those
winnings however you want.

1:16:58.213 --> 1:17:00.182
- I don't understand.

1:17:00.215 --> 1:17:01.883
- We'll then lease
the studio back to you

1:17:01.917 --> 1:17:03.885
for $1 a month for five years.

1:17:03.919 --> 1:17:05.354
And once you get
back on your feet,

1:17:05.387 --> 1:17:06.855
we'll negotiate in good faith.

1:17:06.888 --> 1:17:09.291
- Sounds like a win-win to me.

1:17:10.892 --> 1:17:12.928
- Excuse me one second.

1:17:12.961 --> 1:17:13.962
- Thank you.

1:17:15.163 --> 1:17:16.932
Thank you, Hadley.

1:17:19.868 --> 1:17:20.836
- We all just gonna
stand around here

1:17:20.869 --> 1:17:22.170
or we gonna go celebrate?

1:17:22.204 --> 1:17:23.839
- Mom, you just got
out of the hospital.

1:17:23.872 --> 1:17:25.841
- I'll take it easy.

1:17:25.874 --> 1:17:29.845
- I reserved the banquet
room at Deck 383, my treat.

1:17:29.878 --> 1:17:30.479
- Shall we?

1:17:32.881 --> 1:17:34.383
- We'll meet you guys there.

1:17:34.416 --> 1:17:36.818
Just gotta pack up and change.

1:17:40.889 --> 1:17:43.325
- So, is this it, tiny dancer?

1:17:43.358 --> 1:17:45.927
- Well, we're gonna join
everyone for dinner, right?

1:17:45.961 --> 1:17:47.896
- You know what I mean.

1:17:49.431 --> 1:17:51.366
- Uh, actually, I'm gonna
stay and help my mom

1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:52.701
with the studio.

1:17:55.237 --> 1:17:58.140
- What about that job of yours?

1:17:58.173 --> 1:17:59.107
(light orchestral music)

1:17:59.141 --> 1:18:00.909
- It's just a job.

1:18:04.112 --> 1:18:06.481
Dance is what I love, my family.

1:18:10.419 --> 1:18:11.887
This is my home.

1:18:14.423 --> 1:18:15.457
- I see.

1:18:17.893 --> 1:18:18.927
- What's going on with you?

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:19.895
- Nothing.

1:18:19.928 --> 1:18:21.863
It's all good.

1:18:21.897 --> 1:18:24.132
You know, we should get going.

1:18:24.166 --> 1:18:27.335
(light orchestral music)

1:18:27.369 --> 1:18:29.171
- You're the mystery
investment partner

1:18:29.204 --> 1:18:32.908
who's passionate about
dance, aren't you?

1:18:36.178 --> 1:18:37.045
- Yeah.

1:18:38.346 --> 1:18:40.916
(laughing)

1:18:43.185 --> 1:18:47.155
You know, I guess that
means that, technically,

1:18:47.189 --> 1:18:48.323
I'm your boss.

1:18:51.460 --> 1:18:53.061
- We'll see about that.

1:18:53.095 --> 1:18:56.331
(lights powering down)
