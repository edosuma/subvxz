Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:10.140 --> 00:14.099
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

Well, the forest is still there

you may hear Gargamel's rage.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.070
Achoo!

12:00.090 --> 12:01.200
W-w-w-what was that?

12:02.090 --> 12:03.200
Achoo!

12:04.090 --> 12:06.149
Achoo!

12:06.169 --> 12:08.149
The-the dragon's back.

12:08.169 --> 12:10.230
[dragon sneezing]

12:11.009 --> 12:12.129
Oh, the poor thing.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.230
He's smurfed a terrible cold.

12:15.009 --> 12:18.029
Which might be lucky for us.

12:18.049 --> 12:21.009
I know there's a proper
formula for this somewhere.

12:21.029 --> 12:23.120
Ah! Here we go.

12:23.139 --> 12:26.049
[dragon sneezing]

12:28.200 --> 12:31.029
Now, aim the dragon this way.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.169
Achoo!

12:36.019 --> 12:38.129
[fire crackling]

12:38.149 --> 12:40.100
[all cheering]

12:42.059 --> 12:43.129
[all cheering]

12:45.220 --> 12:47.159
[thunder rumbling]

12:52.110 --> 12:53.220
[teeth chattering]

12:54.000 --> 12:57.179
This is Papa Smurf's
dirty doing.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.179
[meows]

12:59.200 --> 13:01.070
But he'll never beat me.

13:01.090 --> 13:04.000
- Never. Never.
- Never. Never.

13:04.019 --> 13:05.080
Oh!

13:07.100 --> 13:08.190
'Oh.'

13:10.019 --> 13:11.120
[dragon grunting]

13:11.139 --> 13:13.159
[all clamoring]

13:14.149 --> 13:15.210
(Smurfette)
'Hurry up!'

13:19.110 --> 13:22.059
[dragon sneezing]

13:27.000 --> 13:28.059
Cheer up, dragon.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.059
Here's a little of surprise.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.029
Achoo!

13:36.100 --> 13:37.159
[boom]

13:39.110 --> 13:40.210
That's not funny.

13:40.230 --> 13:42.029
How do you like my new

13:42.049 --> 13:44.090
Azrael smurfing trap, Grouchy?

13:44.110 --> 13:46.090
Handy, I hate traps.

13:46.110 --> 13:48.059
[dragon sneezing]

13:49.159 --> 13:51.090
[fire hissing]

13:52.159 --> 13:53.220
Hey!

13:55.120 --> 13:56.179
[whimpers]

13:57.159 --> 13:58.220
I'm sorry, Smurfette

13:59.000 --> 14:00.090
but something's got to be done

14:00.110 --> 14:01.220
about the dragon's sneezing.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.029
But when his cold clears up,
things will be--

14:04.049 --> 14:06.220
(Hefty)
'Papa Smurf, Papa Smurf.'

14:07.000 --> 14:09.049
I found some glowberries.

14:09.070 --> 14:12.159
- Where are they?
- 'On your doorstep. Come on.'

14:14.120 --> 14:16.179
Hey, he ate the glowberries.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.190
Oh, no, naughty dragon.

14:22.090 --> 14:23.139
[hiccup]

14:23.159 --> 14:25.019
Well, now we know where

14:25.039 --> 14:27.080
all the glowberries
disappeared to.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.070
(Smurfette)
'And that's why
he's got the hiccup.'

14:29.230 --> 14:31.220
[hiccup]

14:32.000 --> 14:33.110
(Papa Smurf)
'I'm sorry, Smurfette'

14:33.129 --> 14:35.039
'but he can't stay
in the village.'

14:35.059 --> 14:36.179
You and Hefty
will have to take him

14:36.200 --> 14:38.210
back to the forest,
where he belongs.

14:38.230 --> 14:42.080
Aw. I guess you're right,
Papa Smurf.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.210
[whimpers]

14:43.230 --> 14:48.029
Meanwhile, we still
must find more berries.

14:48.049 --> 14:50.179
[dramatic music]

14:53.129 --> 14:55.230
[whispering]
Psst. Azrael, listen.

14:56.009 --> 14:56.230
Meow?

14:57.009 --> 14:58.210
[indistinct chatter]

14:59.210 --> 15:02.009
That sounds like Smurfs.

15:02.029 --> 15:03.169
[mewing]

15:03.190 --> 15:05.190
A-a-a..

15:10.090 --> 15:12.039
- Phew!
- Whoa!

15:12.059 --> 15:14.159
For a minute there,
I thought we are in trouble.

15:14.179 --> 15:18.139
You are in trouble,
you rotten little Smurfs.

15:18.159 --> 15:19.169
[meows]

15:19.190 --> 15:21.019
[both gasp]

15:21.210 --> 15:23.059
Now, I've got you.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.200
[evil laughter]

15:24.220 --> 15:28.090
Oh, I've lived
for this glorious day.

15:28.110 --> 15:30.100
[growling]

15:30.120 --> 15:33.000
A-a-choo!

15:33.019 --> 15:34.100
Yiye!

15:34.120 --> 15:36.110
[screaming]
Whoa!

15:39.019 --> 15:40.190
[snarling]

15:40.210 --> 15:42.000
[Azrael yowls]

15:44.149 --> 15:48.190
Oh, you're better than a knight
in shining armor.

15:50.129 --> 15:52.070
[gasps]
Look out!

15:52.090 --> 15:53.200
- Ah!
- Huh?

15:53.220 --> 15:56.220
Unhand those Smurfs,
you big lizard.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.129
Unhand those Smurfs.

16:00.039 --> 16:01.100
Or I'll..

16:01.120 --> 16:02.149
[growls]

16:02.169 --> 16:03.210
Oh, no..

16:03.230 --> 16:05.120
(Gargamel)
'No, wait, no.'

16:05.139 --> 16:07.039
[Gargamel screaming]
'No!'

16:10.230 --> 16:13.210
[panting]
We lost two Smurfs, Azrael.

16:13.230 --> 16:16.220
But we gained a secret weapon.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.019
[laughing]

16:19.039 --> 16:20.220
[growling]

16:21.000 --> 16:22.220
[snoring]

16:23.000 --> 16:25.200
Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!

16:25.220 --> 16:28.009
Gargamel has captured
the dragon.

16:28.029 --> 16:31.090
In Gargamel's hands,
he could become our worst enemy.

16:31.110 --> 16:33.149
Now, we need glowberries
more than ever.

16:33.169 --> 16:36.149
'Invisibility may be
our only defense.'

16:36.169 --> 16:39.080
We'll find them, Papa Smurf!
Don't you worry.

16:40.129 --> 16:44.049
I hate glowberries,
but I hate Gargamel more.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.009
[instrumental music]

16:50.080 --> 16:52.110
You're not smurfing
the area well enough.

16:52.129 --> 16:54.149
If Papa Smurf were here,
he'd say

16:54.169 --> 16:56.169
"Smurf in that burrow,
smurf in that hole

16:56.190 --> 16:57.230
smurf behind.."

17:00.230 --> 17:03.000
[thud]

17:03.019 --> 17:06.059
Some Smurfs
just can't take direction.

17:08.150 --> 17:12.000
A-a-a-choo!

17:12.019 --> 17:14.108
There must be some way
we can make use

17:14.130 --> 17:16.220
of this fiery beast, Azrael.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.049
Yeah.

17:20.150 --> 17:21.180
I have it!

17:21.200 --> 17:24.180
Oh, what an evil genius I am.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.200
- Evil.
- 'Meow!'

17:26.220 --> 17:29.069
- Evil! Evil!
- 'Meow! Meow!'

17:31.069 --> 17:33.009
[mewing]

17:35.049 --> 17:36.119
[fire crackling]

17:37.059 --> 17:38.200
[fur sizzling]

17:46.009 --> 17:48.029
[Gargamel laughing]

17:59.170 --> 18:03.150
I'm a wizard way ahead
of my time, Azrael.

18:03.170 --> 18:05.079
Way ahead!

18:05.099 --> 18:06.160
[cackling]

18:07.140 --> 18:08.200
[meows]

18:08.220 --> 18:11.029
This time, there is no way

18:11.049 --> 18:13.160
those miserable Smurfs
can hide from me.

18:13.180 --> 18:14.200
[meows]

18:16.059 --> 18:19.069
[all clamoring]

18:22.019 --> 18:25.059
Their village has to be
around here somewhere, Azrael.

18:25.079 --> 18:26.160
[meow]

18:26.180 --> 18:28.039
It's Gargamel, alright.

18:28.059 --> 18:31.009
He'll see the village easy
from up there, Papa Smurf.

18:31.029 --> 18:33.000
And we still don't
have any glowberries

18:33.019 --> 18:35.029
for the invisibility spell.

18:35.049 --> 18:37.029
Somehow we must delay him.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.220
Leave it to me, Papa Smurf.

18:40.049 --> 18:43.140
Oh, all this excitement
is making me tired.

18:48.109 --> 18:50.130
Ah-ha, here they come

18:50.150 --> 18:51.230
just as I thought.

18:57.150 --> 18:59.210
Azrael, prepare to attack.

19:01.069 --> 19:03.079
[dramatic music]

19:05.079 --> 19:09.000
Now, to unveil
our secret weapon.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.099
A-a-a..

19:16.119 --> 19:18.160
[gasps]
It's the little dragon.

19:19.099 --> 19:20.160
Ready.

19:21.190 --> 19:23.009
Aim.

19:25.140 --> 19:26.180
Fire.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.160
A-a-choo!

19:29.180 --> 19:32.009
(both)
Yikes! Look out!

19:32.029 --> 19:33.059
[squawking]

19:37.220 --> 19:39.009
[laughing]

19:39.029 --> 19:41.180
What a dandy
secret weapon you make

19:41.200 --> 19:43.150
my scaly friend.

19:43.170 --> 19:45.059
Lazy, we've got
get close enough

19:45.079 --> 19:47.019
to puncture that balloon.

19:52.230 --> 19:54.039
Ready.

19:54.059 --> 19:55.119
Aim.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.019
Fire.

19:57.039 --> 19:59.059
A-a-choo!

20:00.099 --> 20:01.160
[shrieking]

20:06.069 --> 20:09.099
Caterpillar hair.
More caterpillar hair.

20:09.119 --> 20:11.079
We're all out, Papa Smurf.

20:11.099 --> 20:13.019
Well, go get some.

20:13.039 --> 20:16.150
Yes, Papa Smurf, I was just
going to do that, Papa Smurf.

20:18.009 --> 20:20.170
Uh, no caterpillar hair
in there. He he he.

20:20.190 --> 20:23.150
But I-I'll get them,
Papa Smurf. Yes, sir.

20:26.009 --> 20:28.099
Hang on, Lazy.
Here we go again.

20:28.119 --> 20:29.180
Oh..

20:31.069 --> 20:32.119
Fire!

20:32.140 --> 20:36.019
A-a-choo!

20:40.089 --> 20:42.079
There!
There-there's the village.

20:42.099 --> 20:44.230
'Oh, this is too good
to be true.'

20:45.009 --> 20:46.109
[laughing]

20:46.130 --> 20:48.230
It's ready.
Keep your fingers smurfed.

20:49.009 --> 20:50.069
[bubbling]

20:51.140 --> 20:54.160
Here I come, miserable Smurfs!

20:54.180 --> 20:56.089
[cackling]

20:56.109 --> 20:59.009
- He spotted the village.
- We've got to stop him.

20:59.029 --> 21:00.200
[squawking]

21:00.220 --> 21:03.220
The village is right
on target, ready?

21:04.180 --> 21:06.049
Aim.

21:06.069 --> 21:07.069
Fire!

21:07.089 --> 21:08.180
A-a-a..

21:08.200 --> 21:10.029
[muffled sneezing]

21:11.069 --> 21:12.190
[screaming]

21:12.210 --> 21:15.049
- The dragon.
- Oh, no!

21:16.140 --> 21:17.160
[screaming]

21:21.210 --> 21:23.069
[thud]

21:27.160 --> 21:28.220
Mama.

21:30.190 --> 21:33.059
[slurping]

21:42.210 --> 21:44.190
What, what happened
to the village?

21:44.210 --> 21:47.109
I-I saw it.
I know I did.

21:47.130 --> 21:48.220
[mewing]

21:50.089 --> 21:52.109
It worked, Papa Smurf.

21:52.130 --> 21:54.119
[all cheering]

21:56.039 --> 21:57.230
[growling]

21:59.150 --> 22:02.059
Azrael, we-we lost the village.

22:02.079 --> 22:04.009
You rotten beast!

22:04.029 --> 22:06.130
It was your fault.
Your fault!

22:06.150 --> 22:09.009
[growling]

22:11.220 --> 22:13.160
Help! Help!

22:15.099 --> 22:16.190
Help!

22:16.210 --> 22:18.099
[Azrael yowling]

22:23.170 --> 22:26.140
And for bravery beyond
the call of smurfdom

22:26.160 --> 22:30.140
I congratulate you,
Hefty Smurf and Lazy Smurf.

22:30.160 --> 22:33.069
Uh, where is Lazy?

22:34.170 --> 22:36.180
[Lazy snoring]

22:36.200 --> 22:39.160
I knew everything would
smurf out, Papa Smurf.

22:39.180 --> 22:41.109
I wasn't scared
for a moment.

22:41.130 --> 22:43.220
I told them
you'd take care of..

22:44.000 --> 22:46.069
Yike! Gargamel!

22:51.069 --> 22:53.119
[all laughing]

22:57.130 --> 23:00.130
This is all your fault,
you idiotic cat!

23:00.150 --> 23:02.190
What do you have
to say for yourself?

23:02.210 --> 23:06.029
A-a-a-achoo!

23:06.220 --> 23:08.160
[splash]

23:09.089 --> 23:10.170
Ohh!

23:14.029 --> 23:16.059
[theme music]
