WEBVTT

00:00.852 --> 00:02.525
Previously,
on "criminal minds"...

00:03.133 --> 00:05.884
When do I leave?

00:05.969 --> 00:07.820
The end of the week.

00:07.887 --> 00:09.488
They can't just
take you away.

00:09.556 --> 00:10.889
It's done.

00:13.309 --> 00:15.661
You want me to raise your son

00:15.729 --> 00:17.429
so he can have your life?

00:17.497 --> 00:18.447
He needs a mother.

00:18.515 --> 00:19.815
I can't do this.

00:19.882 --> 00:21.817
Go to your father.

00:21.884 --> 00:23.902
That corner right there,
that's where he died,

00:23.987 --> 00:26.405
and that's where
I'm gonna kill you.

00:26.489 --> 00:27.406
There's something
you don't know

00:27.490 --> 00:28.957
about those photos.

00:29.025 --> 00:31.410
God, so they took pictures
of them being shot?

00:31.494 --> 00:33.245
Look at the fingernails.

00:33.313 --> 00:34.747
Oh, my God.

00:34.831 --> 00:36.365
Just because I held
a gun to him

00:36.416 --> 00:37.833
doesn't mean I shot him.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.034
I staged his death.

00:39.085 --> 00:40.836
He's alive?!

00:42.756 --> 00:44.173
No, no, no. No, Emily.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.642
Stay with me.
Come on, stay with me.

00:46.709 --> 00:48.260
Where's the medic?!

00:48.344 --> 00:50.195
She never made it
off the table.

00:50.263 --> 00:54.016
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.218
Yeah, sometimes I feel like
I want to quit my job

00:56.269 --> 00:58.804
and spend my time chasing down
the son of a bitch who killed Emily.

00:58.872 --> 01:00.105
You're damn right I'm angry.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.390
The bureau is facing
a lot of changes.

01:01.441 --> 01:03.058
Over the next few weeks
each of you is going to be asked

01:03.109 --> 01:04.447
if you'd like to stay
with the unit.

01:04.447 --> 01:05.400
Why wouldn't we?

01:05.405 --> 01:07.005
There are other options
for you out there.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.665
You've given some thought
to what we discussed?

01:09.732 --> 01:11.900
I'm coming back.

01:17.791 --> 01:21.059
And how long have you
been back with the bureau?

01:21.127 --> 01:22.744
3 1/2 months, sir.

01:22.796 --> 01:24.413
A lot has happened
since then.

01:24.464 --> 01:26.732
Sabbaticals, transfers,
reassignments.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.168
Four of you remained
in the unit?

01:29.235 --> 01:31.253
Agents Rossi, Morgan,
and I were there

01:31.304 --> 01:33.222
with our technical
analyst Penelope Garcia.

01:33.289 --> 01:36.391
Hmm. You had 14 cases
in that time.

01:36.459 --> 01:37.759
17, sir.

01:37.811 --> 01:40.429
Oh, yes. In 14 weeks.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.214
That's impressive.

01:42.282 --> 01:43.749
Thank you.

01:43.817 --> 01:45.434
But what's more impressive

01:45.485 --> 01:48.437
is the fact that you were
reinstated, promoted,

01:48.488 --> 01:50.939
and suspended
in that short time.

01:50.990 --> 01:54.159
I believe that's a record,
Agent Jareau.

01:56.629 --> 01:58.163
Why aren't we in there?

01:58.248 --> 02:00.165
They're just trying
to intimidate us.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.683
Well, that's not
about to happen.

02:01.751 --> 02:03.235
I'm not ok with this.

02:03.303 --> 02:04.937
You may not even
be a witness.

02:05.004 --> 02:06.538
Sir, I'm not worried
about me.

02:06.623 --> 02:08.607
Don't they have
anything better to do than--

02:08.675 --> 02:10.008
baby girl, this is
just what they do.

02:10.092 --> 02:11.760
Anything?

02:13.680 --> 02:15.948
It doesn't look good.

02:16.015 --> 02:17.783
How long is she
gonna be in there?

02:17.851 --> 02:19.051
- Two days?
- That's correct.

02:19.135 --> 02:20.686
How can an investigation
be active

02:20.770 --> 02:23.388
for just two days when the
gathering of intel took months?

02:23.473 --> 02:26.058
There's surveillance and
hundreds of man-hours to prove it.

02:26.142 --> 02:27.226
Yes, that's true, but--

02:27.310 --> 02:29.027
How often do you spend
months on a case, Agent?

02:29.112 --> 02:30.529
We don't,
but this one was--

02:30.613 --> 02:31.697
Personal?

02:31.781 --> 02:32.948
Different.

02:33.015 --> 02:34.566
It required
a lot of detail.

02:34.651 --> 02:36.235
If this was too big
for your team,

02:36.319 --> 02:37.736
why wasn't it
a joint taskforce?

02:37.820 --> 02:39.571
We didn't have time, sir.

02:39.656 --> 02:41.240
Once the subject
was confirmed,

02:41.324 --> 02:42.507
we had to act quickly.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:55.081 --> 03:56.698
I've got the shot, Agent.

03:56.766 --> 03:58.767
Don't take the shot!
Don't shoot!

03:58.818 --> 04:00.068
I got him!

04:05.107 --> 04:07.326
Want to kill me
yourself, Agent?

04:12.215 --> 04:14.132
Do you realize
what you've done?

04:14.217 --> 04:16.051
Yes. We put
an international criminal

04:16.118 --> 04:18.053
with terrorist connections
in federal custody.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.805
You may consider that
a victory,

04:19.889 --> 04:22.557
but you used government funds
for a personal vendetta,

04:22.625 --> 04:24.893
never called Homeland Security,

04:24.960 --> 04:27.562
and now 6 people,
including two of your agents,

04:27.630 --> 04:28.947
are dead.

Queen Elizabeth I said,

"the past cannot be cured."

05:11.730 --> 05:14.415
Interpol, Europol, the CIA.

05:14.499 --> 05:16.083
No one could locate Ian Doyle,

05:16.168 --> 05:17.585
except Agent Morgan.

05:17.669 --> 05:18.753
Well, it wasn't easy.

05:18.837 --> 05:20.438
Doyle disappeared
underground.

05:20.505 --> 05:23.274
It looks like Agent Morgan
spent the first few months

05:23.341 --> 05:26.093
following Doyle's arms-dealing
contacts but came up empty.

05:26.178 --> 05:28.262
So, how did he find him?

05:28.346 --> 05:30.514
After hitting dead ends
in that world,

05:30.582 --> 05:32.600
Agent Morgan put
himself in Doyle's shoes

05:32.684 --> 05:34.101
and knew that
he would be looking

05:34.186 --> 05:35.719
for his son, Declan.

05:37.355 --> 05:41.275
Ok, Emily needed to get
Declan a new identity.

05:41.359 --> 05:42.777
So she must have used
someone she trusted.

05:42.861 --> 05:44.261
All right, well,
that's a short list,

05:44.312 --> 05:45.780
but it's probably
not even written down.

05:45.864 --> 05:47.782
Even if it was, she's had
contacts all over the world.

05:47.866 --> 05:49.650
Oh, tell me about it.
Two columns--

05:49.718 --> 05:51.452
domestic and imports.

05:51.536 --> 05:53.604
Hey.

05:53.655 --> 05:55.289
You guys seen Spence?

05:55.373 --> 05:57.774
- He's at the firing range.
- Again?

05:57.826 --> 05:59.493
Ever since Prentiss died,
he...

05:59.578 --> 06:01.545
Right.

06:01.613 --> 06:03.197
Uh...

06:03.265 --> 06:04.698
Did you guys
just get a new case?

06:04.766 --> 06:06.500
It's just an old one.

06:06.585 --> 06:08.369
Do you want some fresh eyes?

06:08.436 --> 06:09.753
Not just yet.

06:09.805 --> 06:10.805
Ok.

06:10.872 --> 06:13.841
Um, well, let me know.

06:15.143 --> 06:16.977
Shouldn't we tell <i>her?</i>

06:17.062 --> 06:19.430
Garcia, this has been
a long shot for 6 months.

06:19.481 --> 06:20.748
Why get her hopes up?

06:20.816 --> 06:21.882
What about Hotch?

06:21.950 --> 06:23.901
He knows I'm doing this.

06:23.968 --> 06:25.436
He does?

06:25.487 --> 06:26.770
Not technically,

06:26.822 --> 06:29.757
but he knows I'm not
about to let Doyle roam free.

06:29.825 --> 06:32.426
Does he know we're
looking for Declan?

06:32.494 --> 06:36.080
I just figured I'd call him
when I have something to report.

06:36.147 --> 06:38.616
Ok.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.769
But it feels weird
not sharing.

06:41.837 --> 06:43.437
Baby girl.

06:43.505 --> 06:46.607
You don't have to do this.

06:46.675 --> 06:48.759
I know.

06:53.298 --> 06:55.599
Did you trust Agent Jareau?

06:55.667 --> 06:56.600
I did.

06:56.668 --> 06:57.718
But don't anymore.

06:57.786 --> 06:58.936
I didn't say that.

06:59.003 --> 07:01.722
You left her out
but involved Penelope Garcia,

07:01.806 --> 07:02.973
whom you trust.

07:03.024 --> 07:04.225
That is not why.

07:04.309 --> 07:05.392
Isn't it?

07:05.477 --> 07:07.561
Her specific skills
were very helpful.

07:07.646 --> 07:08.696
For your vendetta.

07:08.780 --> 07:09.914
For justice.

07:09.981 --> 07:12.416
You don't believe
in the system.

07:12.484 --> 07:15.519
Ian Doyle wasn't at the top
of anyone's list, Senator.

07:15.587 --> 07:16.770
Except yours.

07:18.323 --> 07:19.907
I'm thinking
domestic contacts.

07:19.991 --> 07:21.375
Em was already
in the states

07:21.459 --> 07:24.245
when she faked
Declan's death, so...

07:24.329 --> 07:26.530
Her associates
must be in Boston?

07:26.581 --> 07:30.417
No, Garcia, she would have
covered her tracks better than that.

07:30.502 --> 07:33.737
All right, why did Prentiss
join the BAU?

07:35.340 --> 07:37.057
To have a normal life.

07:37.142 --> 07:40.261
She could have gone anywhere
with her skill set,

07:40.345 --> 07:41.762
but she chose D.C.

07:41.846 --> 07:43.314
Maybe to be close
to her mom?

07:43.381 --> 07:45.432
No. No way.
That was just by default.

07:45.517 --> 07:48.152
Garcia, she did all of this
to protect a child.

07:48.219 --> 07:50.104
Right. So you're saying
she came here

07:50.188 --> 07:51.572
just so she could
be close to the kid.

07:51.656 --> 07:52.773
And if she did,
she probably had people

07:52.857 --> 07:54.275
she could trust
living right here.

07:54.359 --> 07:55.609
Right. So domestic contacts.

07:55.694 --> 07:59.496
There are surprising few
in our nation's capital.

07:59.564 --> 08:02.182
One of which is dead.
Ben Corelli.

08:02.250 --> 08:05.068
He was the forger.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.070
Doyle killed him
and Prentiss' friend.

08:07.122 --> 08:09.306
He worked out of
his apartment, remember?

08:09.374 --> 08:11.508
Yeah. And we processed
his belongings.

08:15.263 --> 08:16.513
Thanks.

08:16.581 --> 08:19.416
This would have been
a heck of a lot easier

08:19.467 --> 08:20.768
had he gone digital.

08:20.852 --> 08:23.086
Garcia, there's an art
to all of this.

08:23.138 --> 08:24.421
This guy was meticulous.

08:24.489 --> 08:25.823
Definite control freak.

08:25.890 --> 08:27.258
Yet he's dead.
He couldn't control that.

08:27.325 --> 08:29.643
There can't be a lot of I.D.s
for children.

08:29.728 --> 08:32.196
Actually,
you would be surprised.

08:32.263 --> 08:33.563
Ok, wait a minute.

08:33.615 --> 08:36.400
Didn't Prentiss live in
Reston, Virginia, for a while?

08:36.451 --> 08:37.835
Yeah. Before we knew her,

08:37.902 --> 08:39.436
she rented a big house
in a cul-de-sac.

08:39.486 --> 08:42.089
Ok, why would she live
way out there?

08:43.325 --> 08:45.159
To be close to Declan.

08:45.243 --> 08:46.961
- Mm-hmm.
- Who had blond hair and blue eyes.

08:47.028 --> 08:49.279
Well, I'm sure they've changed
his hair color by now.

08:49.331 --> 08:52.750
Yeah, but you can't change
those cerulean blues.

08:54.219 --> 08:55.952
Ok, here's the nanny.

08:56.004 --> 08:57.538
Garcia, she still lives
in Virginia.

08:57.605 --> 09:00.057
Here's all I got. Declan's
going to a boarding school

09:00.124 --> 09:03.477
in Stafford county. His nanny
lives 5 minutes from campus.

09:03.561 --> 09:05.813
All signs point to
a really well-adjusted kid.

09:05.897 --> 09:07.731
He's an honor student.
He's playing lacrosse.

09:07.799 --> 09:10.234
He's winning science fairs.
It looks like he's got the life

09:10.301 --> 09:12.903
Emily wanted him to have.

09:15.457 --> 09:16.740
You watched Declan
for two months.

09:16.808 --> 09:18.192
I knew if I could find him,

09:18.259 --> 09:20.694
it was only a matter of time
before Doyle did.

09:20.779 --> 09:23.480
Around-the-clock surveillance
requires constant presence.

09:23.531 --> 09:25.215
When I wasn't in the field,
I was there.

09:25.283 --> 09:26.734
And when you were
on a case?

09:26.801 --> 09:28.819
I set up pole cameras
for surveillance.

09:28.887 --> 09:30.254
Under what authority, Agent?

09:30.321 --> 09:32.339
Senator, I needed
to protect this child

09:32.424 --> 09:34.925
because I knew Doyle
would find him eventually.

09:39.597 --> 09:43.117
And what was the plan
once you found Ian Doyle?

09:43.184 --> 09:44.601
Lock down security
on his son

09:44.669 --> 09:46.103
and then move in
on Doyle.

10:09.878 --> 10:12.079
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:12.163 --> 10:13.881
It's him.
I'm pretty sure it's him.

10:13.965 --> 10:15.799
It's blurry and, you know, he's
not like posing for the camera

10:15.867 --> 10:17.968
or anything like that,
but you said he'd come

10:18.035 --> 10:19.636
and it's been a while
and now he's here and--

10:19.704 --> 10:22.306
Garcia, Garcia, calm down.
Let me take a look.

10:22.373 --> 10:25.893
That's when Agent Morgan
initiated the assault on Ian Doyle.

10:25.977 --> 10:29.713
What? No, it doesn't
work that way, sir.

10:29.764 --> 10:31.482
Agent Morgan called Hotch--

10:31.549 --> 10:33.150
excuse me, our unit chief.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.302
Who was on temporary duty.

10:35.370 --> 10:37.805
I imagine
he wasn't easy to find.

10:37.872 --> 10:39.656
When the team downsized,

10:39.724 --> 10:42.359
he was assigned to lead
an investigative taskforce.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.666
Hotchner.

10:49.734 --> 10:51.585
Hey, it's me.

10:51.669 --> 10:53.253
How's it going out there?

10:53.338 --> 10:54.788
You know, long days,

10:54.873 --> 10:56.790
some territorial
issues to work out.

10:56.875 --> 10:58.792
Nothing surprising.
How's everything there?

10:58.877 --> 11:00.577
Hotch, we found Declan Doyle.

11:00.628 --> 11:01.595
What?

11:01.679 --> 11:03.263
Listen, I knew
that finding the kid

11:03.348 --> 11:05.766
was the only way
I could find Doyle, Hotch.

11:05.850 --> 11:07.250
I know what you're
thinking, man.

11:07.302 --> 11:08.302
Is Declan safe?

11:08.386 --> 11:09.920
Yeah, he is for now.

11:09.971 --> 11:11.271
I've had surveillance
at his house and his school

11:11.356 --> 11:12.539
for a few weeks.

11:12.607 --> 11:13.857
Morgan, I didn't authorize this.

11:13.925 --> 11:15.275
I know you didn't, Hotch,
but listen to me.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.361
I think Doyle may have
found Declan, too.

11:17.429 --> 11:19.229
All right, I'm coming back.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.364
You want me to wait?

11:20.431 --> 11:21.615
Morgan, it could be a trap.

11:21.699 --> 11:24.017
You make sure
you have eyes on Doyle.

11:24.085 --> 11:25.369
And if it is him?

11:25.436 --> 11:27.955
Then you take the shot.

11:28.022 --> 11:30.124
You got any movement?

11:30.208 --> 11:32.409
Negative.
No movement detected.

11:37.248 --> 11:39.550
That's all Hotch said?

11:39.617 --> 11:41.301
Take the shot?

11:41.386 --> 11:44.404
Yeah, but he's pissed.

11:47.058 --> 11:48.308
Hey, Spence.

11:48.393 --> 11:49.643
I can't find him.

11:49.727 --> 11:52.196
What do you mean,
you can't find him?

11:52.263 --> 11:55.516
The headmistress said
Declan got sick and went home.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.385
Ok, uh, call for backup
and get to the house.

11:58.453 --> 11:59.887
- We're already here.
- You see the agents?

11:59.954 --> 12:01.155
Their car's out front.

12:01.239 --> 12:02.305
The lights are off.

12:02.357 --> 12:03.740
I'll call you back.

12:05.527 --> 12:07.644
What--Reid!

13:43.041 --> 13:46.677
I'll check the back.
You take the hallway.

14:11.869 --> 14:12.986
Must be the nanny.

14:13.071 --> 14:14.655
3 bodies and no kid.

14:14.739 --> 14:17.040
Doyle's got him.

14:26.718 --> 14:30.721
The squad car that went by
got Doyle's attention.

14:30.788 --> 14:33.206
You see that?
I've got movement.

14:33.274 --> 14:34.358
He's in there.

14:34.425 --> 14:37.644
We had to move quickly.

14:37.729 --> 14:40.514
Agent Hotchner said
if we have the shot...

14:40.598 --> 14:42.599
Take it.

14:42.650 --> 14:44.151
He's going to the roof.

14:44.235 --> 14:45.635
JJ, cover the back stairs.

14:45.687 --> 14:49.072
Spence. What do you
mean, he's gone?

14:49.140 --> 14:50.607
I've got the shot, Agent.

14:50.658 --> 14:54.494
Don't take the shot!
Don't shoot! I got him!

14:57.481 --> 14:59.816
Want to kill me
yourself, Agent?

14:59.867 --> 15:02.869
Why didn't you let him
take the shot, Agent?

15:02.954 --> 15:05.205
Because a bullet
to Ian Doyle's brain

15:05.289 --> 15:07.074
would have ended
his life too easily?

15:07.141 --> 15:10.594
You wanted him to suffer.

15:10.661 --> 15:13.263
He deserved the same
beating he gave Prentiss,

15:13.330 --> 15:15.432
but I did not unleash
that on him, Senator.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.100
No, you didn't.

15:17.168 --> 15:20.971
Instead, your actions put an
innocent child's life on the line.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.149
Have you ever
been in the field?

15:43.233 --> 15:44.817
I have.

15:44.885 --> 15:46.853
But I'm not the one
on trial, Agent.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.838
Then maybe you can imagine

15:48.906 --> 15:50.473
what it was like
for Agent Morgan

15:50.541 --> 15:54.276
to find Emily Prentiss
dying...

15:54.328 --> 15:56.712
at the hands of Ian Doyle.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.969
Now ask yourself...

16:03.053 --> 16:06.305
Was it wrong
for him to want

16:06.390 --> 16:09.275
to take that man out?

16:15.799 --> 16:18.935
Forgotten where
I've been, Agent?

16:18.986 --> 16:22.004
Places far worse
than this.

16:22.072 --> 16:25.041
Doyle, where's Declan?

16:25.108 --> 16:26.826
Don't play dumb.

16:26.910 --> 16:29.662
You found him
a month before I did.

16:29.746 --> 16:31.998
He's living in that
lovely little house

16:32.065 --> 16:33.866
our friend set up for him.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.335
I should have
found him sooner.

16:36.420 --> 16:40.556
Finally remembered
she likes cul-de-sacs.

16:40.624 --> 16:44.177
Where is Declan right now?

16:44.261 --> 16:47.713
You expect me to believe you had
nothing to do with his abduction?

16:47.798 --> 16:51.033
And you expect me to believe
this isn't part of the strategy?

16:51.101 --> 16:53.269
You tell me
my son is missing

16:53.337 --> 16:55.288
when I know he was safe
a few hours ago?

16:55.355 --> 16:57.773
You'll have to get
more creative.

16:57.841 --> 16:59.308
Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

16:59.359 --> 17:01.510
I am not playing games
with you.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.247
If you care about anybody
other than yourself,

17:04.314 --> 17:06.566
you'll give me a list
of who would have done this.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.251
Why would anyone
take Declan?

17:08.318 --> 17:09.935
You tell me.

17:10.002 --> 17:11.454
No one even knows
he exists.

17:11.521 --> 17:13.823
Someone does.
Because when we followed you

17:13.874 --> 17:16.709
to that little rat trap, somebody
took him from his house.

17:16.792 --> 17:19.161
Somebody else was watching you, Doyle.
Now tell me who.

17:19.213 --> 17:21.696
I don't know.

17:21.748 --> 17:22.898
I don't.

17:22.965 --> 17:26.002
Your son is missing.

17:26.053 --> 17:27.470
So think.

17:32.576 --> 17:35.211
I don't know.

17:35.279 --> 17:38.014
How long has Agent Morgan
been looking for Doyle?

17:38.065 --> 17:40.349
The night he killed
Prentiss in Boston.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.518
He refused to believe
Doyle just vanished.

17:42.569 --> 17:44.904
He's been investigating
Doyle for 7 months?

17:44.988 --> 17:46.689
Mm-hmm.

17:46.740 --> 17:49.442
Why, are you surprised?

17:52.996 --> 17:54.497
He seems genuine.

17:54.564 --> 17:56.115
Well, of course he does.

17:56.199 --> 17:57.967
He's a master manipulator.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.418
See his carotid?

17:59.503 --> 18:02.355
His heart started racing when
Morgan told him about Declan.

18:02.422 --> 18:04.340
The tightness
in his forehead,

18:04.407 --> 18:07.409
his darting eyes,
are signs of real concern.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.684
Well, if he didn't
take his son, then who did?

18:19.273 --> 18:20.923
Damn it.

18:25.178 --> 18:27.063
Rossi, it's me.
I just see one ninja-like guy.

18:27.114 --> 18:28.898
Yeah, he came out of nowhere
you sure?

18:28.949 --> 18:30.816
And just clipped the camera.
I'm sorry.

18:30.901 --> 18:34.537
Don't worry, Garcia.
You were busy looking for Doyle.

18:34.604 --> 18:36.205
She didn't see a team
on the footage.

18:36.272 --> 18:38.374
This was well-organized.
One could have cut the camera

18:38.441 --> 18:40.009
while the other
started in here.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.410
So they cut off the power,

18:41.461 --> 18:43.462
but no signs
of forced entry.

18:43.547 --> 18:45.083
So how do you overpower
two armed agents?

18:45.084 --> 18:46.176
A male and a female.

18:46.201 --> 18:48.145
Maybe whoever did this
posed as the next shift?

18:48.752 --> 18:51.286
Makes sense. Everything
about them seems efficient.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.789
Except they took the time
to shove her in the closet.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.891
So it's personal
and professional.

18:59.646 --> 19:02.131
Only Declan and the caregiver
live here,

19:02.182 --> 19:04.150
so whose stuff is this?

19:04.234 --> 19:07.302
40 long.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.238
You still think
Doyle's behind this?

19:09.305 --> 19:11.374
He's capable
of a lot of things,

19:11.441 --> 19:14.810
but being two places at once
isn't one of them.

19:21.484 --> 19:24.153
Doyle, I'm gonna ask you
one last time...

19:24.204 --> 19:26.672
Who hates you enough
to take him?

19:28.491 --> 19:30.325
How long has it been?

19:30.377 --> 19:32.327
6 hours.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.997
You've had your time
to find him.

19:35.048 --> 19:38.034
Now let me have mine.

19:38.101 --> 19:40.469
That's not about to happen.

19:45.308 --> 19:47.342
He didn't do it.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.195
No.

19:49.279 --> 19:52.514
What the hell
is going on here?

19:54.451 --> 19:56.502
What?

19:58.071 --> 20:00.573
Nothing.

20:00.657 --> 20:03.659
Has Aaron landed?

20:03.710 --> 20:06.629
He's on his way.

20:06.696 --> 20:08.881
Good.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.324
Welcome back, sir.

20:18.392 --> 20:19.708
Thank you.
What have you got?

20:19.760 --> 20:21.560
Got a top-10 list
of Doyle's enemies.

20:21.645 --> 20:22.878
Anybody recently
in the states?

20:22.929 --> 20:24.497
Richard Gerace's
been here a few weeks.

20:24.564 --> 20:26.882
He's a low-level gun-runner who
angrily crossed paths with Doyle.

20:26.933 --> 20:29.718
I caught an image of him on the
surveillance camera at Declan's house,

20:29.770 --> 20:31.670
confirmed it was him
through a scar on his neck.

20:31.738 --> 20:33.739
All right. Get me everything
you can on Gerace.

20:33.824 --> 20:36.025
Yeah. What I just told you
is everything I've got.

20:45.368 --> 20:48.170
Well, that's a good look.

20:48.238 --> 20:49.839
How was the desert?

20:49.906 --> 20:51.674
Hot.

20:51.741 --> 20:53.175
You seen Jack yet?

20:53.243 --> 20:56.345
No. Jessica took him
to Hershey Park for the weekend.

20:56.412 --> 20:57.847
Well, he'll love that beard.

20:57.914 --> 20:59.682
Yeah, we Skyped every day.

20:59.749 --> 21:01.750
He's not a fan.

21:11.928 --> 21:14.980
Doyle, do you consider
Richard Gerace an enemy?

21:15.065 --> 21:17.767
I don't consider him
at all.

21:19.786 --> 21:21.403
Tell me about him.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.825
Gave him a nasty scar
in Belfast 20 years ago.

21:25.909 --> 21:28.627
Hasn't been my problem
since.

21:28.712 --> 21:31.130
Whose problem was he?

21:32.916 --> 21:34.383
She won't help.

21:34.450 --> 21:36.635
Why not?

21:36.720 --> 21:38.387
Because I killed her.

21:38.454 --> 21:41.157
He was referring
to Agent Prentiss?

21:41.224 --> 21:42.558
That's correct, sir.

21:42.625 --> 21:45.427
The government spent
17,400 on her funeral

21:45.479 --> 21:49.265
and another 642,000
on medical expenses.

21:49.316 --> 21:52.268
But this is no surprise
to you.

21:56.806 --> 21:58.858
Hey. Got your message.

21:58.942 --> 22:00.159
It's time.

22:00.243 --> 22:02.161
Why? Morgan may be able
to break Doyle without her.

22:02.245 --> 22:04.997
Declan tried to make
a call. She's on the way.

22:05.081 --> 22:07.750
All right.
I'll get Morgan.

22:07.817 --> 22:09.668
I'll tell the others.

22:12.639 --> 22:14.073
You get anywhere
with Doyle?

22:14.140 --> 22:17.159
Doyle doesn't think Gerace
has the guts to take him on.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.458
But that's definitely
Gerace on the tape.

22:19.459 --> 22:20.459
Welcome back.

22:20.510 --> 22:22.478
Thanks. Everybody
have a seat.

22:22.562 --> 22:24.647
Why?

22:24.714 --> 22:26.315
What's going on?
Everything all right?

22:26.399 --> 22:30.653
7 months ago I made a decision
that affected this team.

22:30.737 --> 22:32.664
As you all know,
Emily had lost a lot of blood

22:32.689 --> 22:33.889
after her fight with Doyle.

22:35.609 --> 22:37.510
But the doctors
were able to stabilize her.

22:37.577 --> 22:39.658
And she was airlifted
from Boston to Bethesda

22:39.683 --> 22:40.883
under a covert exfiltration.

22:42.032 --> 22:44.049
Her identity was strictly
need-to-know.

22:46.403 --> 22:49.221
And she stayed there until
she was well enough to travel.

22:49.289 --> 22:52.591
She was reassigned to Paris

22:52.659 --> 22:54.376
where she was given
several identities,

22:54.461 --> 22:57.146
none of which we had access to
for her security.

23:00.267 --> 23:02.618
She's alive?

23:06.156 --> 23:08.023
But we buried her.

23:08.108 --> 23:11.477
As I said, I take
full responsibility for the decision.

23:11.528 --> 23:14.580
If anyone has any issues,
they should be directed toward me.

23:14.648 --> 23:16.048
Any issues?

23:16.116 --> 23:18.951
Yeah, I got issues.

23:25.525 --> 23:27.826
Oh, my God.

24:11.171 --> 24:15.026
At least
you've got her back.

24:15.039 --> 24:17.457
Did we?

24:21.179 --> 24:22.796
I am so sorry.

24:22.880 --> 24:23.964
I really am.

24:24.048 --> 24:27.768
Not a day went by
that I didn't want to...

24:27.852 --> 24:30.086
Really, I--

24:30.138 --> 24:32.806
you didn't deserve that.

24:32.890 --> 24:35.559
And I'm so sorry.

24:40.531 --> 24:42.949
There's so much I want
to tell you guys,

24:43.034 --> 24:44.785
and I will. I promise.
But right now

24:44.869 --> 24:47.454
I really need to know
what's going on with Declan.

24:47.538 --> 24:49.272
Emily, was there a man
living at the house?

24:49.323 --> 24:50.940
Yes. My friend Tom Koehler.

24:50.992 --> 24:52.659
He was raising Declan
as his own.

24:52.744 --> 24:54.361
I never saw him
where is he?

24:54.429 --> 24:55.846
Go in or out
of that house.

24:55.913 --> 24:57.197
He was on assignment
overseas.

24:57.265 --> 24:58.348
But he's all right?

24:58.416 --> 24:59.783
Yes. He's on his way
back now.

24:59.851 --> 25:01.868
He got a call from Declan,
he called me,

25:01.936 --> 25:04.654
and when I landed, Hotch told me
that you had Doyle in custody.

25:04.722 --> 25:06.122
And because of Tom's
line of work,

25:06.174 --> 25:07.991
that's why you enrolled
Declan in a boarding school.

25:08.059 --> 25:09.926
I made sure that he, Louise,
and I were the only ones

25:09.977 --> 25:12.179
allowed to take him off campus.

25:12.263 --> 25:13.997
Louise took him home
last night because he was sick.

25:14.065 --> 25:15.065
Food poisoning.

25:15.133 --> 25:16.466
Yeah, a few of the kids
had it, apparently.

25:16.517 --> 25:17.967
So whoever did this
got to him on campus.

25:18.019 --> 25:19.453
They knew they only
had one chance.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.354
Current suspect
is Richard Gerace.

25:21.422 --> 25:24.207
He's the most recent
arrival into the states.

25:24.275 --> 25:26.877
We've been tracking his progress
through the city, but we came up empty.

25:26.944 --> 25:29.012
But we know it's him
because he has the scar.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.058
That doesn't make sense.

25:30.083 --> 25:31.896
Gerace gave up on Doyle
a long time ago.

25:32.784 --> 25:34.251
He said you were the only
one who knew Gerace.

25:34.318 --> 25:36.820
Which is why I'm pretty sure
he doesn't have the balls

25:36.871 --> 25:37.987
to pull this off.

25:38.039 --> 25:40.574
There was no forced entry
at the house?

25:40.641 --> 25:42.158
I had two agents
working security.

25:42.210 --> 25:44.177
We think Gerace
and his partner

25:44.262 --> 25:45.595
posed as
the next shift,

25:45.663 --> 25:47.380
and one of the agents
was a woman.

25:47.448 --> 25:49.182
She's the Alpha.

25:49.267 --> 25:52.586
So we're looking for a woman
who's getting back at Doyle.

25:52.653 --> 25:55.388
And our suspect list
just got a whole lot longer.

25:56.507 --> 25:58.942
Doyle had relations
with all of these ladies?

25:59.009 --> 26:00.660
Most.

26:01.779 --> 26:02.946
Wow.

26:03.014 --> 26:04.114
Hey, can you shoot these

26:04.181 --> 26:05.565
into the roundtable room
for me?

26:05.633 --> 26:07.601
Anything you say,
visitor Prentiss.

26:07.668 --> 26:09.469
Thanks.

26:10.822 --> 26:12.122
So you're actually back.

26:12.189 --> 26:13.790
They've been looking
for your replacement,

26:13.858 --> 26:15.292
and Rossi called me.

26:15.359 --> 26:16.626
That's great.

26:16.694 --> 26:18.795
How's Will with
the long hours again?

26:18.863 --> 26:20.130
Long story.

26:20.197 --> 26:21.631
I haven't seen Ashley.

26:21.699 --> 26:23.467
Oh, well, she transferred
to Andi Swann's unit.

26:23.534 --> 26:25.469
Good for her.

26:25.536 --> 26:29.139
So, how, uh, angry
is the team?

26:29.206 --> 26:30.474
They're in shock.

26:30.541 --> 26:32.425
Of course.

26:32.510 --> 26:34.544
Thank you.

26:34.595 --> 26:38.315
It is really good to see you.

26:41.669 --> 26:43.603
These women are associates
of Doyle's

26:43.688 --> 26:45.572
who may have crossed paths
with Gerace.

26:45.656 --> 26:48.074
Anyone have a deeper
personal connection with Doyle?

26:48.142 --> 26:50.944
Whoever took Declan showed
a lot of rage at the nanny.

26:51.028 --> 26:53.230
She had been with Doyle
since before Declan was born.

26:53.297 --> 26:56.416
The nanny represents
a caregiver, a mother figure.

26:56.501 --> 26:57.751
Who is Declan's mother?

26:57.835 --> 27:01.021
Doyle told me
she was dead.

27:05.376 --> 27:07.344
Ohh!

27:15.970 --> 27:18.972
Of course.

27:27.532 --> 27:30.734
Which one is Declan's mom?

27:35.039 --> 27:39.209
Chloe Donaghy. But she had
nothing to do with this.

27:39.276 --> 27:41.795
How do you know?

27:41.879 --> 27:43.630
Did you kill her, too?

27:45.383 --> 27:49.803
Because she tried to kill Declan
before he was ever born.

28:19.083 --> 28:22.052
Do you know who I am?

28:22.119 --> 28:25.154
No.

28:26.374 --> 28:29.459
I'm your mum.

28:32.597 --> 28:35.181
She brought tainted cupcakes
to the boarding school

28:35.266 --> 28:36.683
and just walked right in.

28:36.767 --> 28:38.134
Oh, that is creepy.

28:38.185 --> 28:40.403
We thought Doyle was bad.
Check her out.

28:40.471 --> 28:42.856
Yeah, she ran an international
prostitution ring

28:42.940 --> 28:44.224
before moving on to chemicals.

28:44.308 --> 28:45.425
Distribution
and trafficking,

28:45.493 --> 28:48.177
manufacturing, possession,
weapons charges?

28:48.229 --> 28:50.080
Went away for 3 years.

28:50.147 --> 28:51.231
That's it?

28:51.315 --> 28:53.516
She hardly seems like
the mothering type.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.735
Why would she take Declan?

28:55.820 --> 28:58.121
It isn't love.

28:59.340 --> 29:00.790
Who were her contacts
in the states?

29:00.858 --> 29:03.543
Whoever they are,
they're as good as dead.

29:03.628 --> 29:06.546
She works her people,
sucks 'em dry, and then...

29:06.631 --> 29:07.731
Moves on.

29:07.798 --> 29:10.000
She never wanted Declan.
Why would she take him?

29:10.051 --> 29:11.968
This is about you, Ian.

29:12.036 --> 29:15.088
You just told me you kept her
a prisoner for 9 months.

29:15.172 --> 29:16.222
7.

29:16.307 --> 29:17.340
7.

29:18.809 --> 29:20.293
Did Louise
help deliver Declan?

29:20.361 --> 29:21.511
Yes.

29:24.565 --> 29:27.934
That's called revenge, Ian.

29:28.002 --> 29:30.820
Chloe didn't just forget
about what you put her through.

29:30.888 --> 29:33.740
She would rather have been dead
than to have my baby.

29:33.824 --> 29:35.108
What as I supposed to do?

29:35.192 --> 29:37.994
Chaining her to a bed
wasn't the answer.

29:38.062 --> 29:40.163
She received a lot of money
for her troubles.

29:42.917 --> 29:45.618
That was torture, Ian.

29:45.686 --> 29:49.339
And you don't think
she spent years

29:49.406 --> 29:51.858
figuring out
how to do the same to you?

29:51.926 --> 29:56.129
She took the only thing
you love.

29:56.213 --> 29:59.632
What else would she and Gerace
have to gain from taking Declan?

29:59.717 --> 30:02.435
Money.

30:02.503 --> 30:04.571
That's all
she ever cared about.

30:07.141 --> 30:09.092
I need a list of everyone

30:09.143 --> 30:11.277
with the kind of money
they're looking for,

30:11.362 --> 30:14.531
and anyone else
who wants to hurt you.

30:17.001 --> 30:19.452
Forgetting the international ties for a
minute, what would these unsubs do?

30:19.520 --> 30:21.004
You know, statistically
the abduction

30:21.072 --> 30:22.989
of a child by its mother,
no matter the psychological

30:23.074 --> 30:26.176
disposition of said mother, would
be one of low risk to a child.

30:26.243 --> 30:28.528
She's got plenty of connections.
She could go underground.

30:28.596 --> 30:29.662
Is there anywhere
in the U.S.

30:29.747 --> 30:31.164
Where Chloe and Doyle
had a history?

30:31.248 --> 30:32.966
No. But they do have
a lot of ties in Europe.

30:33.050 --> 30:35.284
Doyle came up with
associates of Chloe's

30:35.336 --> 30:36.953
who have healthy bank accounts.

30:37.004 --> 30:39.372
He thinks it's a trade?
For what, weapons? Drugs?

30:39.440 --> 30:40.673
- Does it matter?
- Garcia, run these names.

30:40.758 --> 30:42.008
See if any have local
connections.

30:42.076 --> 30:43.292
Yeah. What else should I
be looking for, you guys?

30:43.344 --> 30:44.627
Secluded properties.

30:44.678 --> 30:46.963
A legitimate business
that requires international

30:47.014 --> 30:48.314
bank accounts and trade.

30:48.399 --> 30:50.133
It could be mundane.
They survive under the radar.

30:50.184 --> 30:51.518
Garcia, start
with Irish backgrounds.

30:51.602 --> 30:54.938
This type of feud
could go back generations.

30:54.989 --> 30:59.075
Oh. It looks like the Doyles and
the McDermotts have a thing.

30:59.143 --> 31:00.143
What kind of thing?

31:00.211 --> 31:03.279
Ian Doyle murdered
Jimmy McDermott,

31:03.330 --> 31:06.182
but his younger
brother Lachlan

31:06.250 --> 31:07.867
owns an import company.

31:07.952 --> 31:09.202
Do they ship
internationally?

31:09.286 --> 31:11.020
You know it.
He has 3 warehouses,

31:11.088 --> 31:14.390
once of which is slated
to be demolished.

31:14.458 --> 31:15.491
Where?

31:15.543 --> 31:17.277
Inner Harbor, Baltimore.

31:17.344 --> 31:19.262
Let's go.

31:19.329 --> 31:21.598
I trust you called
the Baltimore City Police.

31:21.665 --> 31:22.665
No, sir.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.000
Certainly the harbor police.

31:24.051 --> 31:25.168
No, sir.

31:25.219 --> 31:26.169
Why didn't you?

31:26.220 --> 31:28.004
The last I checked,
it takes and hour

31:28.055 --> 31:30.056
to drive from headquarters
to Baltimore.

31:30.141 --> 31:33.176
And I see
your phones were working.

32:05.209 --> 32:06.876
He's gone.

32:08.846 --> 32:11.397
Over here!

32:17.438 --> 32:19.989
Doyle said Chloe
would clean house.

32:20.057 --> 32:21.808
So what the hell
is she doing now?

32:21.876 --> 32:23.993
She's getting out
of the country.

32:24.061 --> 32:25.628
Gerace was dead weight.

32:25.696 --> 32:28.498
She thinks she's gonna
get more for the kid without him.

32:33.237 --> 32:34.754
Yeah.

32:37.758 --> 32:39.175
Declan's disappeared.

32:39.243 --> 32:41.427
They had him at the warehouse,
but now they're gone.

32:44.932 --> 32:48.551
Your ex is working
with Lachlan McDermott.

32:48.602 --> 32:50.186
How would he leave
the country?

32:50.254 --> 32:52.305
I don't know.

32:52.389 --> 32:55.275
He's got endless funds.
You'll never stop him.

32:55.359 --> 32:56.276
He hates you, doesn't he?

32:56.360 --> 32:57.944
More than you do.

32:58.028 --> 32:59.946
Then I think we should give him
what he really wants.

33:00.030 --> 33:01.264
You.

33:06.862 --> 33:08.730
You're the one who suggested
Ian Doyle be released.

33:09.565 --> 33:10.732
I am.

33:10.816 --> 33:12.767
And you're the only Agent
who has not requested

33:12.851 --> 33:14.268
reinstatement to the unit.

33:14.386 --> 33:15.770
Mm-hmm.

33:15.854 --> 33:18.072
Was the decision to release
Ian Doyle a personal one?

33:18.157 --> 33:20.057
A young boy's life
was at stake.

33:20.109 --> 33:22.076
I ran the probability of his
survival and it wasn't good.

33:22.161 --> 33:25.079
If you want to punish me for taking
a risk, then I encourage you to do that,

33:25.164 --> 33:27.081
but do not put
the rest of my team on trial

33:27.166 --> 33:28.366
for something
that I suggested.

33:28.417 --> 33:29.400
Calm down, Agent.

33:29.451 --> 33:30.818
This is calm,
and it's doctor.

33:30.886 --> 33:33.454
No, we are not letting him
out of here, Reid.

33:33.539 --> 33:34.822
Emily, I will chain myself
to him if I have to.

33:34.890 --> 33:36.507
He'll find a way
to escape.

33:36.575 --> 33:38.009
No, he won't,
and we're running out of time.

33:38.076 --> 33:40.878
If we find McDermott now,
we have a chance to save Declan.

33:44.216 --> 33:47.602
The United States government is not
in the business of trading captives.

33:47.686 --> 33:49.270
New York City, July 2010,

33:49.355 --> 33:51.839
referred to as the spy swap.
Igor--

33:51.907 --> 33:53.274
That's enough.

33:53.359 --> 33:55.109
You can't just
change the rules, sir.

33:55.194 --> 33:57.028
And you just can't break them.

33:59.214 --> 34:00.481
Is Strauss still there?

34:00.566 --> 34:01.482
She is.

34:01.567 --> 34:02.784
We need full support.

34:02.851 --> 34:04.902
Doyle said McDermott's
family imported weapons

34:04.953 --> 34:07.104
to a private airfield
in Maryland.

34:07.156 --> 34:08.406
- Close?
- Largo.

34:08.456 --> 34:10.574
All right,
send me the coordinates.

34:10.626 --> 34:12.076
I fully understand
that, ma'am,

34:12.127 --> 34:14.078
but I'm telling you,
it's only a matter of minutes

34:14.129 --> 34:16.364
before they leave
the country with him.

34:16.431 --> 34:19.050
But what makes you think they won't
take off with Doyle and his son?

34:19.117 --> 34:20.385
We won't let that happen.

34:20.418 --> 34:21.886
You can't guarantee that.

34:21.953 --> 34:23.920
I am certain
that without this move,

34:23.972 --> 34:25.422
there is
a very good chance

34:25.474 --> 34:27.475
that little boy
is going to die.

34:29.762 --> 34:32.313
The team's already
on their way, aren't they?

34:32.398 --> 34:34.614
Yes, ma'am.

34:41.139 --> 34:42.657
Down there.

34:44.326 --> 34:46.944
He looks just like his father.

34:46.995 --> 34:49.580
It makes me sick.

34:49.648 --> 34:51.998
So what are you
gonna do with him?

34:52.083 --> 34:54.202
I didn't think you cared.

34:54.268 --> 34:55.585
I don't.

34:55.654 --> 34:57.705
You were supposed to
get me Doyle.

34:57.790 --> 35:01.008
What can I say?
The feds beat me to it.

35:02.294 --> 35:05.213
He'll have to do.
As long as the kid's alive,

35:05.297 --> 35:06.681
Doyle will find a way
to get to him.

35:06.765 --> 35:09.217
Unless he gets killed
in custody.

35:43.836 --> 35:46.888
You played Gerace.
You're not gonna play me, too.

35:46.972 --> 35:49.307
I don't know
what this is.

35:54.229 --> 35:57.014
Lachlan McDermott and
Chloe Donaghy, this is the FBI.

35:57.065 --> 35:58.215
You called the feds?

35:58.267 --> 35:59.500
Why would I do that?

35:59.568 --> 36:00.818
We know you have Declan.

36:00.886 --> 36:03.488
To ensure his safety
we would like to trade.

36:03.555 --> 36:05.389
We will give you
Ian Doyle

36:05.440 --> 36:07.408
and you send us the boy.

36:07.493 --> 36:10.578
This--this was not our deal.

36:10.662 --> 36:12.613
Not, but it just
got interesting.

36:12.698 --> 36:13.764
You're not leaving.

36:13.832 --> 36:15.283
Uhh!

36:26.578 --> 36:27.979
Get over there, boy.

36:28.046 --> 36:30.247
Bring Doyle here!

36:33.135 --> 36:34.902
I want him here
on his knees!

36:37.356 --> 36:40.424
Hotch, are we really
gonna do this?

36:40.475 --> 36:42.527
No one leaves here.

36:44.530 --> 36:46.030
You bastard.

36:46.097 --> 36:47.732
How's it feeling?

36:50.435 --> 36:53.654
It's your bloody time now,
isn't it?

36:55.040 --> 36:57.775
Now hand him over.

36:59.444 --> 37:00.494
Gun!

37:32.644 --> 37:35.329
I remember you.

37:35.414 --> 37:39.166
Sorry, son.

38:09.114 --> 38:12.366
This team took many
unprecedented risks.

38:12.451 --> 38:14.869
None were approved.

38:14.953 --> 38:16.687
The DIOG has rules,

38:16.738 --> 38:20.274
and you chose to ignore
every last one.

38:20.342 --> 38:21.792
That's blatant disrespect
to the bureau

38:21.860 --> 38:23.861
and to authority of law
in general.

38:23.912 --> 38:25.379
What I find interesting

38:25.464 --> 38:27.915
is that you are the experts
in behavior

38:28.000 --> 38:30.084
but find nothing wrong
with yours.

38:30.168 --> 38:31.702
May I?

38:31.753 --> 38:34.388
The journey was not
traditional,

38:34.473 --> 38:37.708
but this team neutralized
4 international criminals

38:37.759 --> 38:40.061
and saved the life of
a young boy in the process.

38:40.145 --> 38:42.813
You started a war
with Ian Doyle years ago

38:42.881 --> 38:46.734
that this team and the
U.S. government had to finish.

38:46.818 --> 38:48.869
The rest of you are dismissed.

38:48.937 --> 38:51.856
Agent Prentiss, we're not done.

39:13.045 --> 39:14.962
Hey.

39:15.047 --> 39:19.383
I never thought we'd be
taking one of these down.

39:19.434 --> 39:21.185
I already tried.
It's screwed in.

39:21.252 --> 39:22.553
You're kidding me.

39:22.604 --> 39:23.704
I got this.

39:23.772 --> 39:25.206
Perfect.

39:25.273 --> 39:26.640
I also have Sergio.

39:26.725 --> 39:27.858
Oh, I knew you would.

39:27.926 --> 39:29.026
I need visitation rights.

39:29.094 --> 39:31.028
He's a love, isn't he?

39:31.096 --> 39:33.097
Yeah, he's takes after
his mom.

39:40.438 --> 39:42.623
Morgan.

39:46.912 --> 39:48.412
I know what
you've been through.

39:48.463 --> 39:49.730
I understand
that you're angry,

39:49.798 --> 39:50.881
but I hope
that you understand

39:50.949 --> 39:53.084
that this is not
about you...or me.

39:53.135 --> 39:55.219
This was about
saving Emily.

39:56.671 --> 39:59.173
We need to talk.

40:03.979 --> 40:05.896
The committee made it clear

40:05.964 --> 40:09.850
they will not support
a rogue team.

40:09.935 --> 40:13.637
Agent Prentiss convinced them
you were not that.

40:13.688 --> 40:17.508
They will be watching you
closely.

40:17.576 --> 40:20.060
So I suggest you play
by their rules.

40:20.128 --> 40:22.730
So we're ok?

40:22.798 --> 40:24.698
Suspension is lifted
for everyone.

40:24.766 --> 40:26.066
Thank you, ma'am.

40:26.134 --> 40:29.453
There may be more paperwork,
considering your...

40:29.521 --> 40:30.755
situation,

40:30.822 --> 40:34.024
but the team is lucky
to have you,

40:34.092 --> 40:37.244
if you're interested.

40:37.312 --> 40:40.214
May I think about it?

40:40.282 --> 40:42.266
Of course.

40:45.070 --> 40:47.021
I'm in.

40:51.509 --> 40:53.377
I have a stack of cases
on my desk.

40:53.445 --> 40:54.528
I'm happy to pass them
all off to you.

40:54.596 --> 40:56.197
I'll pick them up
in the morning.

40:59.201 --> 41:00.985
Emily, uh...

41:01.987 --> 41:04.038
What did you tell them?

41:04.122 --> 41:06.874
The only people I know
who could accomplish that mission

41:06.958 --> 41:08.375
just walked out.

41:08.460 --> 41:11.495
They do their jobs
with integrity,

41:11.546 --> 41:15.583
and most importantly,
they honor their oath.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.802
"I will support and defend

41:17.869 --> 41:20.754
"the constitution of
the United States of America

41:20.839 --> 41:22.473
"against all enemies,

41:22.541 --> 41:25.242
"foreign and domestic.

41:25.310 --> 41:29.013
"I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same,

41:29.064 --> 41:32.266
"that I take this
obligation freely,

41:32.350 --> 41:34.018
"without any mental
reservation

41:34.069 --> 41:36.386
"or purpose of evasion.

41:36.438 --> 41:38.105
"That I will well
and faithfully

41:38.190 --> 41:40.324
"discharge the duties
of the office

41:40.391 --> 41:42.226
"on which I am
about to enter,

41:42.277 --> 41:44.895
so help me God."
