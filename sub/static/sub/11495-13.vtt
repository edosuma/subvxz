Two and a Half Men...

00:02.264 --> 00:03.855
I am determined
to find someone

00:03.860 --> 00:04.809
who wants
to be with me

00:04.811 --> 00:06.761
for who I am,
not what I have.

00:06.763 --> 00:08.763
You can be whoever you want to be.
Hmm.

00:08.765 --> 00:10.031
I can help you out with that.

00:10.033 --> 00:11.032
Sam Wilson.

00:11.034 --> 00:12.933
Maybe you could crash here.

00:12.935 --> 00:16.270
I think it is great that you're
working on your computer stuff,

00:16.271 --> 00:17.905
but we need help now.

00:17.907 --> 00:20.575
I get it.
Say no more.

00:20.577 --> 00:22.493
I'll start looking
for a job.

00:22.495 --> 00:24.078
Your job's just a way to get by

00:24.080 --> 00:25.946
till you get your big break
as a designer.

00:25.948 --> 00:27.465
What if it
never happens?

00:27.467 --> 00:30.026
I want to invest in
your line of clothing.

00:30.051 --> 00:30.636
Really?

00:30.637 --> 00:32.587
Pack your bags
for New York,

00:32.589 --> 00:35.340
because I am gonna
write you a check

00:35.342 --> 00:37.091
for $50,000.

00:37.093 --> 00:38.309
The stress
of living a lie

00:38.311 --> 00:40.395
is causing you
to just fall apart.

00:40.397 --> 00:41.429
You're binge-eating.

00:41.431 --> 00:42.563
I'll miss you.

00:42.565 --> 00:43.514
I love you, Sam.

00:43.516 --> 00:45.483
Hello? Walden?

00:45.485 --> 00:46.651
Why is it so dark in here?

00:46.653 --> 00:48.186
Alan, no!

00:52.691 --> 00:53.908
Walden.

00:53.910 --> 00:54.993
What's happened
to you?

00:54.995 --> 00:56.995
What do you mean?

00:56.997 --> 00:58.312
Uh... okay.

00:58.314 --> 01:00.665
I-I don't know how
to say this, um...

01:00.667 --> 01:03.001
but you're either
wearing a child's shirt

01:03.003 --> 01:04.652
or carrying a child.

01:05.654 --> 01:08.539
Both options raise concerns.

01:08.541 --> 01:12.043
Hey, I will not apologize

01:12.045 --> 01:14.328
for enjoying the art
of fine cuisine.

01:14.330 --> 01:17.998
Says the guy who has barbecue
sauce all over his back.

01:19.435 --> 01:23.354
Oh, like I'm the first guy
to fall asleep on a McRib.

01:23.356 --> 01:24.772
What are you doing here, Alan?

01:24.774 --> 01:26.441
I'm worried
about you.

01:26.443 --> 01:27.809
I haven't seen you
in three weeks.

01:27.811 --> 01:28.860
Kate's still
in New York.

01:28.862 --> 01:30.778
Why are you still
in her apartment?

01:30.780 --> 01:32.397
I like it here.

01:32.399 --> 01:33.448
It's comfortable.

01:33.450 --> 01:35.015
Besides, the beach house
smells like you.

01:35.017 --> 01:36.517
This place smells like Kate.

01:36.519 --> 01:40.121
I'll take "things a serial
killer would say" for $200.

01:40.123 --> 01:42.457
You want to be my next victim?

01:42.459 --> 01:45.025
Come on, Walden, look at you.

01:45.027 --> 01:46.828
You're-you're
a disgusting blob.

01:46.830 --> 01:49.029
I mean, can you even see
your penis past that gut?

01:49.031 --> 01:51.716
My penis is like Santa Claus.

01:51.718 --> 01:54.385
I don't need to see it;
I just need to believe in it.

01:54.387 --> 01:55.636
Well, you know what I believe?

01:55.638 --> 01:57.221
Living a double life
is killing you.

01:57.223 --> 01:58.890
Well, you don't know
what you're talking about.

01:58.892 --> 02:01.225
So why don't you just go away?

02:01.227 --> 02:02.894
So, you don't think
you need any help?

02:02.896 --> 02:04.645
I know I don't need any help.

02:04.647 --> 02:05.763
Fine, then I'll leave.

02:08.734 --> 02:11.102
Alan?

02:12.654 --> 02:13.571
Yeah?

02:13.573 --> 02:16.557
I need help.

02:16.559 --> 02:18.609
Oh, buddy, it's-it's
gonna be okay.

02:18.611 --> 02:20.728
No, it's not gonna be okay!

02:20.730 --> 02:22.613
I'm out of control!

02:22.615 --> 02:24.949
I'm lying to the woman I love!

02:24.951 --> 02:27.285
And the only thing
I do more than lie

02:27.287 --> 02:29.170
is eat raw cookie dough.

02:29.172 --> 02:31.906
And I think I have salmonella.

02:31.908 --> 02:34.074
Don't worry.

02:34.076 --> 02:35.877
Alan's here now.

02:35.879 --> 02:37.578
We're gonna get you...

02:37.580 --> 02:40.598
hosed down and...
back in shape

02:40.600 --> 02:42.467
and-and feeling like
your old self again.

02:42.469 --> 02:44.051
You think so?

02:44.053 --> 02:45.436
Oh, absolutely.

02:45.438 --> 02:46.754
And after we do,

02:46.756 --> 02:48.689
you're gonna call up Kate
and tell her the truth.

02:48.691 --> 02:49.941
What? No, I can't.

02:49.943 --> 02:51.526
You have to.
Why?

02:51.528 --> 02:53.611
Because the truth will
set you free, and you know it.

02:53.613 --> 02:56.114
Okay.

02:56.116 --> 02:57.031
Maybe you're right.

02:57.033 --> 02:58.649
There you go.

02:58.651 --> 03:02.653
Plus, it'd be nice to lose
the gut and see my penis again.

03:02.655 --> 03:05.823
And I'm sure he'd like
to see you, too.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.039
Oh, my God,

04:00.041 --> 04:04.210
everybody here is pretentious,
bitchy and high.

04:04.212 --> 04:06.679

Are you sure you're not
Skyping from heaven?

04:08.750 --> 04:11.801

04:13.253 --> 04:15.622
Oh, yeah,
that's Britté and Inga.

04:15.624 --> 04:18.141
I guess they're done
throwing up their lunch.

04:18.142 --> 04:20.059
Well, I've got great news.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.644
I'll be there
tomorrow.

You do realize they'll be
dressed by then.

04:24.065 --> 04:26.900
No, I'm coming to see you.

04:26.902 --> 04:28.368
But if the models
are still there

04:28.370 --> 04:30.036
and we wind up getting
in a pillow fight

04:30.038 --> 04:31.905
in our hotel bed,
then so be it.

04:33.074 --> 04:34.090
Are you really coming?

04:34.092 --> 04:35.274
Yeah.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.794
And I got
a big surprise for you.

04:37.796 --> 04:39.896
Oh... Wait, hang on a sec.

04:39.898 --> 04:41.998
How can you afford
a plane ticket?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.751
Alan is flying me on his jet.

04:44.753 --> 04:47.003
Oh, Alan's coming, too.

04:47.005 --> 04:49.055
Yay.

04:52.010 --> 04:53.426
Oh, and do me a favor.

04:53.428 --> 04:55.562
Before I get there, make sure
those models have clothes on.

04:55.564 --> 04:59.899
How do you feel about
naughty school girl outfits?

04:59.901 --> 05:02.402
I find them degrading.

05:02.404 --> 05:03.820
And perfect.

05:05.023 --> 05:07.073
I love you, Sam.
I love you.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.227
So did you tell her?

05:11.229 --> 05:12.745
No.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.647
I want to tell her in person.

05:14.649 --> 05:16.482
So pack
your bags.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.817
We're going to New York.

05:17.819 --> 05:19.085
Me? Why am I going?

05:19.087 --> 05:21.938
This is really scary
for me, Alan.

05:21.940 --> 05:23.339
I need the support of my friend.

05:23.341 --> 05:24.707
Well, you got it.

05:24.709 --> 05:26.376
Thank you.
Uh, uh, Walden?

05:26.378 --> 05:27.877
Yes, I'll cover your expenses.

05:27.879 --> 05:29.796
Great. Um, and...

05:29.798 --> 05:32.048
Yes, I'll give you
per diem.

05:33.083 --> 05:36.836
If he ever gets a real friend,
I'm screwed.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.474
Ooh, you know what we
should do in New York?

05:41.476 --> 05:43.476
Go see a musical.

05:43.478 --> 05:45.528
Yeah, maybe.

05:45.530 --> 05:47.447
If I put my life back together.

05:47.449 --> 05:49.649
Of course.

have a preference.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.030
Can't go wrong
with <i>Wicked.</i>

06:04.865 --> 06:06.549
Sure.

06:07.751 --> 06:10.637
Then again,
<i>Mamma Mia.</i>

06:10.639 --> 06:12.371
Oh, I can never see
that show enough.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.756
I own the movie on Blu-ray.

06:15.392 --> 06:16.559
Two words.

06:16.561 --> 06:18.978
Delightful romp.

06:18.980 --> 06:21.714
You do realize the whole point
of this trip

06:21.716 --> 06:24.400
is to tell the woman I love
that I'm actually someone else?

06:24.402 --> 06:26.402
Oh, I get it.

06:26.404 --> 06:29.388

<i>Les Mis-Representation</i>

06:36.163 --> 06:37.730
Thanks for
the support.

06:37.732 --> 06:40.450
Oh, come on,
lighten up.

06:40.452 --> 06:42.234
Everything's gonna be fine.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.088
I just hope she doesn't like Sam
more than she likes Walden.

06:45.090 --> 06:46.289
Why would she?

06:46.291 --> 06:48.174
Well, a lot of reasons.

06:48.176 --> 06:50.877
One, Sam's better in bed.
What?

06:50.879 --> 06:52.128
He tries harder.

06:52.130 --> 06:53.713
He has to compensate

06:53.715 --> 06:55.348
for all the other things
he doesn't have.

06:55.350 --> 06:57.350
He's banging scared.

06:57.352 --> 07:01.304
If that's true, I'd be
the best lay on the planet.

07:01.306 --> 07:03.556
I just don't want to lose her.

07:03.558 --> 07:05.424
Oh, you won't.

07:07.061 --> 07:11.698
But it's fun to lose yourself
in the magic of Broadway.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.499
Alan.

07:13.501 --> 07:14.867
Fine.

07:14.869 --> 07:18.538
Well, it's too bad
you're in a relationship.

07:18.540 --> 07:22.041
Kate's show will be packed
with half-naked supermodels.

07:22.043 --> 07:23.126
S-Supermodels?

07:23.128 --> 07:24.210
Yeah.

07:24.212 --> 07:25.878
Wow.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.463
Excuse me
a second.

07:27.465 --> 07:29.415
I'm gonna
make a call.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.417
My girl.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.470
Hey, Lyndsey.

07:34.472 --> 07:36.589
Hey, what's up?

07:38.092 --> 07:40.760
I'm flying to New York City.

07:40.762 --> 07:43.012

maybe take in a musical.

07:43.014 --> 07:45.648
Ah. Guys' weekend.

07:45.650 --> 07:47.684
Yes, exactly.

07:47.686 --> 07:49.468
Um, so anyhow,
I just wanted to...

07:49.470 --> 07:51.521
make sure you still love me.

07:51.523 --> 07:53.940
Of course I do.
Why would you even ask?

07:53.942 --> 07:55.825
Well, you know, I'm on a plane.

07:55.827 --> 07:57.910
You know, anything can happen
at any time.

07:57.912 --> 07:58.978
Don't worry, Alan.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.163
I love you.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.188
And we're gonna be
together forever.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.666
O-Okay, sweetie.

08:18.717 --> 08:20.349
So very tall.

08:20.351 --> 08:23.502
Oh. Oh, that-that...
that's an 11.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.605
And... and now
we've got a... a 12.

08:25.607 --> 08:27.506
Oh, God, can you
believe this?

08:27.508 --> 08:29.609
All these beautiful women,
and I'm off the market.

08:29.611 --> 08:32.528
Yeah, 'cause that's what
models are looking for:

08:32.530 --> 08:35.014
a middle-aged, twice
divorced, broke-ass guy

08:35.015 --> 08:37.116
who lives in a guest room
with a dehumidifier

08:37.118 --> 08:38.701
and my old tax returns.

08:38.703 --> 08:41.687
Ooh, "I make enough money
to pay taxes."

08:41.688 --> 08:43.740
Rub my nose in it.

08:43.741 --> 08:44.874
I'm sorry.

08:44.876 --> 08:46.375
I'm just nervous.

08:46.377 --> 08:48.044
I don't know if
I can do this.

08:48.046 --> 08:49.462
I feel like
I'm gonna puke.

08:49.464 --> 08:50.747
Well, this is
the place for it.

08:50.749 --> 08:52.832
Grab a feather
and get in line.

08:52.834 --> 08:53.866
Sam!

08:53.868 --> 08:56.252
Hi, Kate.

08:56.254 --> 08:57.837
Hi.

08:57.839 --> 09:00.556
Alan, it's so good to...

09:01.592 --> 09:03.259
Alan!

09:03.261 --> 09:05.511
I'm very, very
happy for you.

09:05.513 --> 09:06.679
I hope this fashion show
brings you

09:06.681 --> 09:08.431
all the success in the world.
Thank you.

09:08.433 --> 09:10.566
Why don't I leave
the two of you alone

09:10.568 --> 09:12.735
while I fill my head
with images to think of

09:12.737 --> 09:14.987
when I'm having sex
with the woman I love.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.525
I am so happy
you're here.

09:19.527 --> 09:21.560
Are you kidding? I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.779
So, what's this big surprise

09:22.781 --> 09:25.081
you had to fly all the way
to New York to talk to me about?

09:25.083 --> 09:26.833
Yeah... the surprise.

09:26.835 --> 09:28.451
That's...

09:28.453 --> 09:31.120
Okay, uh...

09:31.122 --> 09:32.088
close your eyes.

09:32.090 --> 09:34.406
All right.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.960
Kate, I'd like you to
meet Walden Schmidt.

09:42.217 --> 09:43.299
I don't understand.

09:43.301 --> 09:45.468
My name's not
Sam Wilson.

09:45.470 --> 09:47.270
It's Walden Schmidt.

09:47.272 --> 09:48.938
What?

09:48.940 --> 09:51.107
♪ Walk like a man

09:51.109 --> 09:53.442
♪ Talk like a man

09:53.444 --> 09:57.363
♪ Walk like a man, my son

09:57.365 --> 09:59.398
♪ No woman's worth ♪

09:59.400 --> 10:01.067
♪ Crawling on the earth...

10:08.318 --> 10:09.718
Wait a sec.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.887
Your name's not Sam Wilson?

10:11.889 --> 10:14.140
No.

10:14.142 --> 10:16.208
And I'm not broke, either.

10:17.344 --> 10:18.911
I have a lot of money.

10:18.913 --> 10:22.048
In fact, I have
more than a lot.

10:22.050 --> 10:24.417
Like, think about
a lot of money,

10:24.419 --> 10:26.202
and then multiply
it by ten...

10:27.237 --> 10:29.205
...thousand.

10:29.207 --> 10:31.624
But how is this possible?

10:31.626 --> 10:33.376
You worked at
a Christmas tree lot.

10:33.378 --> 10:34.894
You didn't chip in on the rent.

10:34.896 --> 10:37.847
I saw you use toilet paper
as a coffee filter.

10:37.849 --> 10:39.849
That's only because
the day before

10:39.851 --> 10:42.018
I used the last coffee
filter as toilet paper.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.519
Okay.

10:43.521 --> 10:46.088
Why are you
doing this, Sam?

10:46.090 --> 10:48.140
It's not Sam.
It's Walden.

10:48.142 --> 10:49.425
Okay, whatever your name is,

10:49.427 --> 10:52.445
why would you lie
about who you are?

10:52.447 --> 10:55.231
Because I wanted to meet
someone like you.

10:55.233 --> 10:57.149
Someone who's kind

10:57.151 --> 10:58.868
and genuine and sweet

10:58.870 --> 11:00.453
and not after my money.

11:00.455 --> 11:03.789
Someone that I felt like I had
a real connection with.

11:03.791 --> 11:06.625
So, to make sure
you could trust me,

11:06.627 --> 11:07.910
you lied to me?

11:07.912 --> 11:09.445
I'm really sorry.

11:09.447 --> 11:11.113
I-I got caught up in it,

11:11.115 --> 11:13.749
and then I-I couldn't figure out
how to get out, and it...

11:13.751 --> 11:17.619
Trust me, you are the most
amazing person I've ever met.

11:17.621 --> 11:21.790
I love you whether I'm
Sam Wilson or Walden Schmidt.

11:21.792 --> 11:23.459
Well, good for you.

11:23.461 --> 11:26.896
Unfortunately, I have no idea
who Walden Schmidt is.

11:26.898 --> 11:29.615
Kate, wait.

11:29.617 --> 11:30.966
You know what?

11:30.968 --> 11:35.137
This whole time, I thought
<i>he</i> was the douche.

11:35.139 --> 11:37.523
Turns out <i>you're</i>
the douche.

11:42.312 --> 11:44.530
Unbelievable.

11:44.532 --> 11:46.648
She likes me.

11:52.456 --> 11:53.789
How you doing?

11:56.460 --> 11:57.460
I've been better.

11:57.462 --> 11:59.595
Aw, I'm sorry, buddy.

11:59.597 --> 12:01.714
You know what might
cheer you up?

12:02.766 --> 12:04.016
There are still tickets

12:04.018 --> 12:06.335
for tonight's performance
of <i>Jersey Boys.</i>

12:06.337 --> 12:09.004
We're not going to <i>Jersey Boys.</i>

12:09.006 --> 12:10.689
Oh, I totally get it.

12:10.691 --> 12:12.224
<i>Lion King</i> it is.

12:12.226 --> 12:14.810
We're not going
to any musical at all.

12:14.812 --> 12:16.228
Fine.

12:17.514 --> 12:20.182
I just don't understand why
we both have to be depressed.

12:20.184 --> 12:23.152
I don't think she's
ever going to forgive me.

12:24.404 --> 12:25.538
Why would she?

12:25.540 --> 12:28.624
I mean, I lied to her
about everything.

12:28.626 --> 12:31.160
I don't want to give
anything away

12:31.162 --> 12:33.245
in case you change
your mind and we do go,

12:33.247 --> 12:34.914
but...

12:34.916 --> 12:37.500
when Simba lies to his friends

12:37.502 --> 12:41.003
by not telling them
that he's the Lion King,

12:41.005 --> 12:42.338
they forgive him

12:42.340 --> 12:45.474
after a few short but snappy
dance numbers.

12:45.476 --> 12:48.844
Life is not a musical, Alan.

12:49.846 --> 12:51.046
So knock it off.

12:51.048 --> 12:53.349
See, that wouldn't
have hurt so much

12:53.351 --> 12:55.017
if you'd sung it.

12:55.019 --> 12:58.404
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm just upset.

12:59.406 --> 13:01.991
I mean, I did
what I did for love.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.694

It's Kate.

16:32.268 --> 16:34.269
Hey, Kate.

16:35.121 --> 16:36.872
Yeah, I can meet.

16:36.874 --> 16:38.774
Yeah, I'll be right there.

16:38.776 --> 16:40.609
Okay.

16:40.611 --> 16:42.077
She wants to see me.

16:42.879 --> 16:44.580
Here, take care
of the check for me.

16:44.582 --> 16:46.732
Will do.

Douche.

17:06.269 --> 17:07.969
Hey.

17:07.971 --> 17:10.105
Hey.

17:10.107 --> 17:11.490
How'd the show go?

17:11.492 --> 17:13.325
It was pretty amazing, actually.

17:13.327 --> 17:16.994
The buyer from Neiman Marcus
is interested in my stuff.

17:16.997 --> 17:18.914
That's great.

17:18.915 --> 17:20.749
About halfway through the show,

17:20.751 --> 17:22.251
I realized that...

17:22.252 --> 17:25.621
Alan probably didn't pay
for this, did he?

17:25.623 --> 17:26.922
No.

17:27.973 --> 17:30.158
But if the models ask,
throw him a bone.

17:31.762 --> 17:32.961
Thank you.

17:32.963 --> 17:35.497
I'm really sorry.

17:36.699 --> 17:39.017
Do you think that there's
a way that we can...

17:39.019 --> 17:40.436
make this work?

17:40.438 --> 17:42.271
I don't know.

17:42.273 --> 17:44.523
I mean, I trusted you, and...

17:44.525 --> 17:46.174
you didn't trust me.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.062
Now I don't even
know who you are.

17:50.064 --> 17:53.232
Well, if you think about it,
I'm really the same guy.

17:53.234 --> 17:55.067
I just have a better watch.

17:55.069 --> 17:57.319
And a better car.

17:57.321 --> 17:58.404
A better house.

17:58.406 --> 17:59.405
A better...

17:59.407 --> 18:02.191
jet.

18:03.911 --> 18:06.078
So nothing about you is real.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.831
What's real is that I love you.

18:08.833 --> 18:12.918
Okay, well...

18:12.920 --> 18:16.138
I'm gonna need some time
to process all of this.

18:22.595 --> 18:25.481
So, you think...

18:25.483 --> 18:27.182
maybe when we
get back to L.A...

18:27.184 --> 18:28.350
I'm not going back to L.A.

18:28.352 --> 18:29.551
What?

18:29.553 --> 18:31.737
Yeah, thanks to you, I...

18:31.739 --> 18:33.555
might have a life here now.

18:33.557 --> 18:35.607
Wow.

18:35.609 --> 18:38.277
I didn't think any
of this through, did I?

18:38.279 --> 18:41.196
Apparently not, Walden Smith.

18:41.198 --> 18:43.282
It's actually Schmidt.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.118
You know, it's not important.

18:47.203 --> 18:50.405
So I guess I'll just wait
to hear from you.

18:50.407 --> 18:52.007
I guess so.

18:53.376 --> 18:55.410
Good-bye, Sam.

19:01.017 --> 19:02.468
It's Walden.

19:02.470 --> 19:03.469
Hey.

19:03.471 --> 19:05.737
Look who needs
a ride back to L.A.

19:05.739 --> 19:08.724
<i>Ja,</i> Alan the billionaire's
got a big jet.

19:10.109 --> 19:12.478
It slipped out while they
were running away from me.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.614
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

19:23.214 --> 19:25.048
<i>Ooh, too much champagne!</i>

19:27.269 --> 19:29.870
They are... awfully pretty.

19:29.872 --> 19:32.039
Yeah.

19:32.041 --> 19:33.723
You, uh... you gonna?

19:36.611 --> 19:38.745
Nah, I'm not interested.

19:38.747 --> 19:39.947
Oh, me, neither.

19:39.949 --> 19:41.698
You know, I have a girlfriend.

19:42.834 --> 19:44.568
But, you know,
if we could, uh,

19:44.570 --> 19:46.286
which, uh... which one
would you choose?

19:50.291 --> 19:51.458
Probably the brunette.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.877
Really? The brunette?

19:53.879 --> 19:55.712
Oh, you want the brunette?

19:55.714 --> 19:57.414
Oh, me? No, I...

19:57.416 --> 20:00.083
I said, you know...
the aforementioned girlfriend.

20:02.687 --> 20:04.605
Although Lyndsey is a blonde,

20:04.607 --> 20:08.091
and the brunette would make
a very nice palate cleanser.

20:09.294 --> 20:11.528
You know, uh, uh...
hypothetically.

20:11.530 --> 20:13.196
Fine.

20:13.198 --> 20:14.364
You can have the brunette.

20:14.366 --> 20:15.432
Hypothetically.

20:15.434 --> 20:16.984
If we're talking hypothetically,

20:16.986 --> 20:19.369
it's my plane, you're not here,
and I'm taking them both.

20:21.239 --> 20:23.073
Right. Are we
done with this?

20:23.075 --> 20:25.275
Hypothetically.

20:26.444 --> 20:28.078
So, uh, I assume you're

20:28.080 --> 20:29.379
moving back into
the beach house.

20:29.381 --> 20:30.831
Yeah.
Good. Good.

20:30.833 --> 20:32.382
The place felt
empty without you.

20:32.384 --> 20:33.333
Oh, please.

20:33.335 --> 20:34.668
You loved every minute of it.

20:34.670 --> 20:36.470
I did. I really did.

20:36.472 --> 20:39.789
I got to tell you,
your bed ruined me.

20:39.791 --> 20:42.175
And I ruined it.

20:42.177 --> 20:43.677
Ugh.

20:43.679 --> 20:46.313
I'm sorry, buddy.
You were gone a long time.

20:46.315 --> 20:48.899
I'm just gonna miss

20:48.901 --> 20:51.268
waking up next to Kate
every morning. Mmm...

20:51.270 --> 20:55.105
I'm gonna miss driving
your fancy sports car.

20:55.107 --> 20:57.441
I'm gonna miss
the way she held my hand

20:57.443 --> 20:59.109
when we watched a movie.

20:59.111 --> 21:00.810
I'm gonna miss the way

21:00.812 --> 21:03.030
your underwear felt
fresh from the dryer.

21:05.566 --> 21:06.867
I'm taking the brunette.
