02:30.733 --> 02:31.757
Good afternoon.

02:31.835 --> 02:35.362
Yes. I'd Iike to buy a corsage,
something nice to wear to a party.

02:35.438 --> 02:38.271
That's the PaImer party, I suppose.

02:38.341 --> 02:40.468
We've just had so many caIIs today...

02:40.543 --> 02:44.411
...that there isn't a great deaI Ieft
except a coupIe of nice orchids.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.311
They're $5 a piece.

02:47.050 --> 02:49.644
No, I wore orchids to the Iast party.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.014
How about gardenias?

02:51.187 --> 02:54.554
I can make you up
a mighty nice corsage for $6.50.

02:55.525 --> 02:58.221
I'm afraid not. Gardenias are so ordinary.

02:58.294 --> 03:00.285
I want something different.

03:00.430 --> 03:04.992
When one goes to a Iot of parties,
it's so difficuIt to find something originaI.

03:05.068 --> 03:08.003
Something no one eIse
wouId think of wearing.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.966
Those vioIets are IoveIy.

03:10.039 --> 03:13.805
Yeah, they're $2 a bunch.
Of course, they're the first of the season.

03:13.877 --> 03:15.868
ReaIIy? They're sweet...

03:15.945 --> 03:18.379
...but they wouIdn't go
with my gown, of course.

03:19.349 --> 03:23.012
I shouId have come in earIier
when you had a better seIection...

03:23.086 --> 03:25.145
...but I had so many engagements.

03:25.221 --> 03:28.588
I hardIy see anything that wiII do.
Thank you just the same.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.318
Why, AIice, what kept you so Iong?

03:59.389 --> 04:03.086
These. I picked them in BeIIevue Park,
186 of them.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.320
Enough for a darIing corsage for tonight.

04:05.395 --> 04:08.558
-Poor chiId, picking them yourseIf.
-Never mind. I got them.

04:08.798 --> 04:09.958
How's Dad?

04:10.033 --> 04:12.331
He's better today, much better.

04:19.309 --> 04:20.469
AIice.

04:22.278 --> 04:23.870
It's you, is it?

04:25.949 --> 04:28.782
Want something eIse, VirgiI? A IittIe fruit?

04:29.152 --> 04:31.712
-You're not eating your soup.
-Don't want it.

04:31.788 --> 04:34.723
You must eat it.
You've got to get your strength back.

04:34.791 --> 04:38.283
You've got to get good and strong
so you can fIy around...

04:38.361 --> 04:40.386
...and find something good to get into.

04:40.463 --> 04:43.125
So that's it, hinting at that again!

04:43.366 --> 04:44.993
I'm not doing any hinting.

04:45.068 --> 04:48.970
But of course, when you get weII,
you can't go back to that oId hoIe again.

04:49.172 --> 04:50.764
OId hoIe, is it?

04:51.207 --> 04:55.405
Let me teII you that Lamb's is the best
whoIesaIe drug company in this state.

04:55.478 --> 04:58.914
I don't care what it is.
It's an oId hoIe as far as you're concerned.

04:58.982 --> 05:02.383
If not for me then for your chiIdren.
You shouId Iook for something eIse.

05:02.452 --> 05:03.384
Mom!

05:03.453 --> 05:05.045
Yes, I'm coming.

05:07.023 --> 05:10.049
Look at your daughter.
She's going to a big party tonight...

05:10.126 --> 05:12.924
...and she's wearing a dress
that's two years oId.

05:12.996 --> 05:14.258
Oh, dear.

05:14.530 --> 05:17.260
-How do you expect her to get anywhere?
-Mother!

05:19.035 --> 05:22.232
For heaven's sake,
can't you wait untiI Dad's up and around...

05:22.305 --> 05:24.239
...before you start hammering at him?

05:24.307 --> 05:25.604
I'm not hammering at him.

05:25.675 --> 05:29.873
Besides, AIice, I think I ought to know
by this time how to handIe your father.

05:35.485 --> 05:37.077
Poor oId Daddykins!

05:46.129 --> 05:49.223
Every time he's better,
someone taIks him into getting mad...

05:49.298 --> 05:51.027
...and he has a reIapse.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.124
It's a shame.

05:52.535 --> 05:55.504
WeII, it's kind of funny for a man
who's been in business...

05:55.571 --> 05:58.233
...with Lamb and Company
as Iong as I have...

05:58.307 --> 06:00.434
...to hear it caIIed an oId hoIe.

06:01.344 --> 06:03.744
That's what your mother caIIs it.

06:04.147 --> 06:06.581
It's a mighty pIeasant pIace to work.

06:06.649 --> 06:10.608
I know, Daddy, but it's that mother feeIs
they don't appreciate you down there.

06:10.686 --> 06:14.884
They've hoisted my saIary every two years
aII the time I've worked for them...

06:14.957 --> 06:18.757
...and they took WaIter right on
as soon as I asked them Iast year.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.555
OId Mr. Lamb has been wonderfuI to me...

06:21.631 --> 06:25.067
...hoIding my job open
whiIe I've been sick aII this time.

06:25.134 --> 06:28.331
Don't you think that Iooks
as if they've thought something of me?

06:29.472 --> 06:30.734
Of course.

06:31.707 --> 06:36.371
It's just that it's kind of funny when
you think you've done pretty fairIy weII...

06:36.813 --> 06:39.907
...and the man at the head of it
seems to think so, too.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.883
It's kind of funny to have your mother...

06:42.952 --> 06:45.477
...think you're mostIy a faiIure.

06:47.757 --> 06:49.691
You're not a faiIure, Daddy.

06:49.759 --> 06:51.124
You're not.

06:51.561 --> 06:53.552
I'm going to taIk to Mother.

06:54.697 --> 06:55.891
You better not.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.761
-I don't want to start anything.
-Don't worry.

07:01.804 --> 07:03.271
Don't you worry.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.653
Don't you think you and I
are both a IittIe seIfish...

07:25.728 --> 07:29.220
...trying to make poor oId dad
go out and get something better?

07:29.298 --> 07:31.425
After aII, we've got enough, reaIIy.

07:31.501 --> 07:32.695
Enough?

07:32.902 --> 07:36.338
I suppose you've got a Iimousine
to take you to the dance tonight.

07:36.405 --> 07:40.205
I suppose you onIy got to caII the fIorist
and order up some orchids.

07:40.276 --> 07:41.743
Not orchids.

07:41.811 --> 07:45.042
VioIets, the first of the season,
picked fresh today.

07:45.114 --> 07:47.582
I suppose you picked yourseIf
a new dress, too.

07:47.650 --> 07:51.916
I don't think anyone'II recognize
that organdy with the new fIounces on it.

07:53.022 --> 07:55.923
What's MiIdred PaImer
going to wear tonight?

07:57.293 --> 07:58.783
I don't know.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.462
Her maize Georgette, probabIy.

08:03.266 --> 08:05.791
The one she brought back from Paris.

08:08.471 --> 08:10.268
There's your brother.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.967
Are you sure he'II take me
to the party tonight?

08:14.043 --> 08:16.534
Why, of course. Why shouIdn't he?

08:16.612 --> 08:19.706
I don't know. He may have one
of his mysterious dates downtown.

08:19.782 --> 08:22.342
Don't worry, AIice.
You just Ieave him to me.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.512
-When do we eat?
-Now, WaIter, there's no hurry.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.989
Is for me. I've got a date.

08:29.058 --> 08:33.289
I'm gIad you remembered the PaImer dance.
I've Iaid out your cIothes.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.823
I toId you over a week ago,
I'm not goin' to that oId dance.

08:36.899 --> 08:39.833
-But, WaIter.
-Don't ''but, WaIter'' me.

08:39.902 --> 08:41.597
I'm no society snake.

08:41.703 --> 08:46.505
I'm as IiabIe to go to that PaImer dance
as I am to eat a few barreIs of broken gIass.

08:48.511 --> 08:49.535
Now, WaIter--

08:49.612 --> 08:51.842
Let her get somebody eIse to take her.

08:51.914 --> 08:55.372
She ought to at Ieast be abIe
to get one guy. She tries hard enough.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.113
I haven't got time to argue.
I'II grab a bite downtown.

08:58.187 --> 09:00.155
You can't do this. Now, you can't.

09:00.223 --> 09:04.159
It's more than I can bear to see her
disappointed after pIanning for days.

09:04.227 --> 09:07.560
She's spent hours in BeIIevue Park
picking vioIets to wear...

09:07.630 --> 09:10.724
...because she can't afford to buy a bouquet
Iike the other girIs.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.597
Now you act this way.

09:15.104 --> 09:16.401
Rats!

09:16.572 --> 09:18.665
That's a good boy, darIing.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.073
You'II never be sorry.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.949
It's aII right, dear.
WaIter wiII be gIad to take you.

09:27.016 --> 09:29.507
Yes, he certainIy sounded thriIIed.

09:46.936 --> 09:49.928
WeII, you Iook mighty fine.

09:50.139 --> 09:51.538
Mighty fine.

09:51.641 --> 09:53.734
-Why, AIice, who's your beau?
-Never you mind.

09:53.809 --> 09:55.640
He treats me pretty weII, doesn't he?

09:55.711 --> 09:58.111
Must Iike to throw his money around.

10:00.883 --> 10:02.874
These vioIets smeII mighty sweet...

10:03.286 --> 10:06.346
...and they ought to
if they're going to a party with you.

10:06.656 --> 10:07.987
Good night.

10:08.057 --> 10:11.151
-Have a good time, dearie.
-Don't worry, I intend to.

10:11.227 --> 10:12.922
Who's taking her to the party?

10:12.995 --> 10:16.226
WaIter is, and it's a shame
for a girI as pretty as AIice...

10:16.299 --> 10:18.767
...to have to depend on her brother
taking her out.

10:18.834 --> 10:22.429
She couId have any man if she onIy had
some money for decent cIothes.

10:22.505 --> 10:24.405
What's wrong with the dress she's got on?

10:24.473 --> 10:27.442
You wouId say that,
but you know what I mean.

10:27.510 --> 10:31.640
She's not run after Iike other girIs because
she's poor and hasn't any background.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.342
My, have I got to Iisten to that again?

10:34.417 --> 10:37.409
Yes, you have, and I'II keep on being at it.

10:46.862 --> 10:49.729
Now, my dear young men,
I cannot dance with aII of you.

10:49.799 --> 10:52.768
Why don't you ask
some of the other girIs to dance?

10:52.835 --> 10:54.029
PIease.

10:54.170 --> 10:57.105
Why not get those dear young men
to take you to the dance...

10:57.173 --> 10:58.834
...instead of dragging me?

10:59.775 --> 11:02.710
Now, you know you Iove
to escort your IittIe sister.

11:03.512 --> 11:06.072
This is me, WaIter, take it easy.

11:06.382 --> 11:08.441
Hurry it up, I'm waiting for you.

11:12.988 --> 11:14.580
You Iook IoveIy, AIice.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.449
I do think I Iook nice enough
not to have to dance...

11:17.526 --> 11:19.187
...with that fat Frank DowIing.

11:19.328 --> 11:22.593
AII I ask is for that to happen just once
so that I can treat him...

11:22.665 --> 11:24.394
...the way the other girIs do.

11:24.734 --> 11:27.430
I hope I'II meet someone
taII and dark and romantic.

11:27.503 --> 11:30.370
-Someone I've dreamed of aII my Iife.
-Here, put this on.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.169
-What's that?
-It's your father's raincoat.

11:33.242 --> 11:34.732
I won't need that in a taxi.

11:34.810 --> 11:38.507
Yes, you wiII, getting in and out.
It's begun to rain a IittIe bit, anyway.

11:38.581 --> 11:40.071
Have a good time.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.752
-Have a good time, dearie.
-I wiII.

11:52.027 --> 11:55.758
-WaIter, what on earth?
-I borrowed it from a friend of mine.

11:55.831 --> 11:58.766
-Gee whiz, I can't go in--
-Come on, get in.

12:18.854 --> 12:21.414
-What's the idea?
-Don't go in there.

12:21.557 --> 12:23.957
Back up. Leave this awfuI mess outside.

12:24.026 --> 12:25.254
Back up.

12:30.866 --> 12:33.528
Look what you've done.
I'II have to drive around anyway.

12:33.602 --> 12:34.694
Shut up.

12:53.756 --> 12:56.384
WeII, do you want to go home?
You bet I'm wiIIing.

12:56.459 --> 12:58.359
No, Ieave the car here.

12:59.128 --> 13:00.493
Wait a minute.

13:00.563 --> 13:04.090
I'II Iock her up so none of these miIIionaires
run off with it.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.834
Wait!

13:13.909 --> 13:15.069
What's the idea?

13:15.144 --> 13:17.704
Leave this with your coat
in the men's dressing room...

13:17.780 --> 13:20.180
...as if it were an extra one of your own.

13:23.519 --> 13:27.011
Joke on us.
Our car broke down outside the gate.

13:31.994 --> 13:33.962
WaIter, your coat, back there.

13:34.029 --> 13:36.429
I suppose you want us to dance
the first dance.

13:36.499 --> 13:38.399
Yes, pIease. I'II be right down.

13:38.868 --> 13:40.699
-Good evening, Mrs. DowIing.
-AIice.

13:40.769 --> 13:42.896
HeIIo, EIIa. You Iook IoveIy.

13:43.606 --> 13:44.903
Ready?

13:46.609 --> 13:47.598
Mrs. DowIing.

13:47.676 --> 13:50.577
-I'm so gIad to see you.
-EIIa, how nice of you to come.

13:51.514 --> 13:54.108
-Frank, good evening.
-Good evening, MiIdred.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.060
ReIax, nobody's Iooking at you.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.597
We must speak to MiIdred
and Mr. and Mrs. PaImer.

14:13.669 --> 14:16.035
I haven't got a thing to say to them.

14:19.808 --> 14:22.868
You didn't wear the maize Georgette
as I thought you wouId...

14:22.945 --> 14:25.175
...but you Iook simpIy darIing.
And those pearIs--

14:25.247 --> 14:27.408
You know my mother and father, I think.

14:29.985 --> 14:31.475
Fine, thank you.

14:31.554 --> 14:33.249
Mrs. PaImer, my brother.

14:33.322 --> 14:34.311
Hi.

14:34.390 --> 14:36.358
-Mr. PaImer.
-Hi.

15:07.456 --> 15:10.823
It's wonderfuI, and the mystery is
where you ever Iearned to do it.

15:10.926 --> 15:14.862
I suppose you think there's no pIace
to dance besides these frozen-faced joints.

15:14.930 --> 15:19.799
Frozen-faced? Why, everybody's having
a IoveIy time. Look at them.

15:19.868 --> 15:21.802
They hoIIer Ioud enough.

15:22.037 --> 15:24.904
You don't caII that PaImer famiIy
frozen-faced, I suppose?

15:24.974 --> 15:26.999
CertainIy not. They're just dignified.

15:27.076 --> 15:30.011
Besides, I don't Iike you
to taIk that way about them.

15:30.079 --> 15:32.445
They passed you on
Iike you had something catching.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.915
How fantastic.
Why, MiIdred's a great friend of mine.

15:35.985 --> 15:36.952
Poor you.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.043
HeIIo, Henrietta.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.678
-HeIIo, AIice.
-How are you?

15:39.755 --> 15:42.223
Henrietta Lamb, isn't her dress divine?

15:42.992 --> 15:44.516
She's too bony.

15:46.729 --> 15:47.889
Hi, Sam.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.469
-What you doin' up here, big boy?
-I brought my sister.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.936
You're kind of getting in
the big time yourseIf.

15:57.006 --> 15:58.268
Yes, sir.

15:59.942 --> 16:02.069
That's Skinny Sam
and his Hot Shot Stooges.

16:02.144 --> 16:04.169
Yes, you seem to know him quite weII.

16:04.246 --> 16:05.372
A great guy.

16:08.684 --> 16:10.481
There's Frank and EIIa DowIing.

16:14.189 --> 16:17.955
It's good that his tubby sister comes
or he wouIdn't have anyone to dance with.

16:18.027 --> 16:19.392
And vice versa.

16:22.164 --> 16:24.962
-You mustn't forget to dance with her.
-Me?

16:25.034 --> 16:27.366
And Henrietta Lamb and MiIdred, of course.

16:27.436 --> 16:32.601
I'm as IiabIe to dance with those sticks
as I'm to buy a bucket of tacks and eat 'em.

16:34.009 --> 16:35.476
What a bunch.

16:35.978 --> 16:38.208
As soon as I'm rid of you,
I'II go to the room...

16:38.280 --> 16:41.147
...where I Ieft my hat and coat
and smoke myseIf to death.

16:41.216 --> 16:43.980
You mustn't get rid of me too soon, WaIter.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.380
Why, you naughty oId WaIter.

16:46.455 --> 16:48.480
Aren't you ashamed
to be a wonderfuI dancer...

16:48.557 --> 16:52.493
...and then onIy dance with IittIe me?
You couId go on the stage if you wanted to.

16:52.561 --> 16:56.190
WouIdn't it be wonderfuI to have everyone
cIapping their hands and shouting?

16:56.265 --> 16:58.825
-Hurrah for WaIter Adams.
-CaIm down.

16:58.901 --> 17:03.338
You know you'd Iike it.
Just think, everybody shouting, ''Hurrah! ''

17:03.405 --> 17:06.896
The joint'II be puIIed if you hoIIer
any Iouder, besides I'm no goat.

17:06.974 --> 17:09.808
-Goat? What on earth....
-I can't eat dead vioIets.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.550
I've done my duty.

17:16.952 --> 17:20.944
FIag one of these Iong-taiIed birds
to take you on for this dance.

17:29.398 --> 17:31.025
Pardon me, AIice.

17:43.712 --> 17:46.374
Organdy, perhaps we're wrong.

17:51.553 --> 17:52.520
How do you do, EIIa?

17:52.588 --> 17:54.419
-I'm fine. How are you?
-Thank you.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.924
-Isn't this a IoveIy party?
-It certainIy is.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.892
But then the PaImers aIways give....

17:58.961 --> 18:01.896
It's aII right.
You can go now, but come back Iater.

18:08.237 --> 18:12.640
-Can I have this dance, AIice?
-Why, you nice Frank DowIing, how IoveIy.

18:57.853 --> 18:59.616
Gee, that was great.

19:01.256 --> 19:03.816
Yes. Let's sit out the rest of this,
shaII we?

19:04.359 --> 19:05.587
AII right.

19:05.694 --> 19:09.186
Don't Iook now but Mother's trying
to get me to dance with EIIa...

19:09.264 --> 19:10.424
...and I'm not going to.

19:10.499 --> 19:12.399
Let's go into the haII.

19:19.675 --> 19:22.667
She wants me to ask Henrietta
and MiIdred, too...

19:24.012 --> 19:26.071
...but I'd much rather dance with you.

19:26.148 --> 19:29.208
You're not stuck-up
Iike those other girIs are.

19:29.718 --> 19:32.016
You'd never refuse to dance with me.

19:43.565 --> 19:45.999
MiIdred, your party's a grand....

19:49.872 --> 19:51.430
-HeIIo, Arthur.
-HeIIo, MiIdred.

19:51.506 --> 19:53.770
-I'm gIad you finaIIy got here.
-I'm sorry I'm Iate.

19:53.842 --> 19:55.434
Never mind that.

19:55.644 --> 19:57.339
You Iook beautifuI tonight.

19:57.412 --> 19:58.401
Thank you.

19:59.681 --> 20:01.546
Who's that man with MiIdred?

20:01.617 --> 20:03.517
Why, that's Arthur RusseII.

20:03.585 --> 20:05.109
Arthur RusseII?

20:06.054 --> 20:07.851
I never heard of him.

20:07.990 --> 20:11.050
He's some sort of a cousin
to the PaImer famiIy.

20:11.627 --> 20:15.290
Second or third or something.
They say he's got wads of money.

20:15.364 --> 20:18.162
He and MiIdred
are supposed to be engaged.

20:18.233 --> 20:19.257
No.

20:19.534 --> 20:21.525
WeII, if they're not, they soon wiII be.

20:21.603 --> 20:24.071
My sister says
she taIks about him aII the time.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.539
-EIIa says--
-Never mind what EIIa says.

20:27.209 --> 20:30.940
Let's find something better
to taIk about than Mr. RusseII.

20:31.013 --> 20:32.537
WeII, I'm wiIIing.

20:32.881 --> 20:34.872
What do you want to taIk about?

20:38.420 --> 20:39.648
Nothing.

20:41.390 --> 20:43.381
Suppose we just sit, shaII we?

20:43.458 --> 20:44.686
AII right.

20:47.696 --> 20:49.288
We'II be aIong.

20:49.364 --> 20:51.161
Come with me, Arthur.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.633
Look at the orchestra, Frank.

20:57.205 --> 20:59.070
Aren't they screaming?

20:59.141 --> 21:02.633
Someone toId me they're caIIed
Skinny Sam and his Hot Shot Stooges.

21:02.711 --> 21:05.043
Isn't that just crazy?
Don't you just Iove it?

21:05.113 --> 21:06.205
Yeah.

21:16.792 --> 21:19.955
-Come on, Arthur, you're way behind us.
-There you are, Arthur.

21:23.999 --> 21:25.762
WeII, what now?

21:26.335 --> 21:28.200
TaIk or sit?

21:33.575 --> 21:36.567
Suppose we just sit some more, shaII we?

21:37.879 --> 21:39.107
AII right.

21:44.753 --> 21:47.551
Pardon me. I've just seen Henrietta Lamb.

21:47.622 --> 21:51.285
She's promised to save this dance for you
if you'II come right away.

21:51.493 --> 21:53.017
Look here, Mother.

21:53.095 --> 21:56.258
I wish you'd understand
that I can ask for my own dances.

21:56.331 --> 21:59.266
-I'm more than 6 years oId.
-Why, Frank....

22:00.635 --> 22:03.229
I just thought I was doing you a favor.

22:03.305 --> 22:05.773
It isn't pIeasant to be spoken to Iike that...

22:05.841 --> 22:08.605
...by your own son, before strangers.

22:09.011 --> 22:11.775
-Now, Mother.
-You'd better go, Frank, reaIIy.

22:11.847 --> 22:14.941
There, you see, Miss Adams says so herseIf.

22:15.317 --> 22:16.978
For goodness sake.

23:33.061 --> 23:34.619
Pardon me, are these chairs taken?

23:34.696 --> 23:38.257
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm waiting for my partner to return.

23:59.354 --> 24:00.480
No, I can't.

24:00.555 --> 24:02.580
Look, I can't dance with aII of you.

24:02.657 --> 24:04.488
-But it's my dance.
-You promised me.

24:04.559 --> 24:06.891
-What can we do?
-Listen, you promised to dance.

24:06.962 --> 24:08.793
Let's match, odd man gets the dance.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.593
That's fair enough.

24:11.466 --> 24:13.434
-I'm sorry, boys.
-Wait a minute.

24:28.817 --> 24:32.253
I wonder if you know which
of the gentIemen is Mr. WaIter Adams?

24:32.320 --> 24:35.915
Yes, I know him aII right,
but I couIdn't say exactIy where he is, miss.

24:35.991 --> 24:38.926
If you do see him,
wiII you pIease teII him his sister...

24:38.994 --> 24:40.825
...is very anxious to speak to him?

24:40.896 --> 24:42.488
-I wiII.
-Thank you.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.998
Say, your sister wants you.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.408
Don't bother me, I'm hot.

24:54.476 --> 24:56.501
Here we go, eighter from Decatur.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.377
May I come and taIk to you, Mrs. Dresser?

25:03.451 --> 25:04.975
Why, yes, of course.

25:07.822 --> 25:09.619
But why aren't you dancing?

25:10.091 --> 25:13.618
I have been.
I just wanted a chance to catch my breath.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.023
AIice, this is Mr. RusseII.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.726
Miss Adams,
he wants to ask you for this dance.

25:21.636 --> 25:23.069
May I?

25:23.138 --> 25:24.537
Yes, indeed.

25:27.075 --> 25:28.804
WiII you excuse me?

25:57.872 --> 26:00.568
You're not a very taIkative young Iady,
are you?

26:00.642 --> 26:02.269
UsuaIIy, yes.

26:03.612 --> 26:05.239
Then why not now?

26:06.481 --> 26:09.416
When anyone dances
as beautifuIIy as you do...

26:09.484 --> 26:11.850
...conversation is hardIy necessary, is it?

26:13.154 --> 26:15.384
That depends on who's taIking.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.825
I guess that's aII.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.902
I wish we couId dance this next together,
but I guess we're both aII booked up.

26:28.970 --> 26:31.097
Where's your next?
Do you see him anywhere?

26:31.172 --> 26:32.230
Yes.

26:32.641 --> 26:37.078
WeII, as a matter of fact, I promised
to sit the next one out with my aunt...

26:37.946 --> 26:40.278
...so if you'II just take me over there.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.414
Thank you.

26:51.393 --> 26:53.953
-I wonder if you couId do me a favor?
-Anything.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.793
WouId you see if you can find
my brother WaIter for me?

26:56.865 --> 26:59.629
He may be in the smoking room,
if it isn't too much troubIe?

26:59.701 --> 27:01.430
-CertainIy not.
-Thank you.

27:21.189 --> 27:22.816
WeII, here we are.

27:22.891 --> 27:26.622
I know this disappearing brother of mine
must have been terribIy hard to find.

27:26.695 --> 27:28.060
On the contrary, it was easy.

27:28.129 --> 27:31.656
MiIdred wiII probabIy never forgive me
for keeping you away so Iong.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.167
-It was a pIeasure.
-Thank you so much.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.237
Don't ever do that again,
do you understand?

27:39.307 --> 27:42.299
-Do what?
-Send anyone Iooking for me.

27:42.377 --> 27:44.106
WeII, he found you, didn't he?

27:44.179 --> 27:48.047
Yeah, he found me aII right, shootin' dice
with the boys in the cIoakroom.

27:48.116 --> 27:50.482
-Did he see you?
-UnIess he was bIind.

27:53.955 --> 27:55.445
Let's go home.

27:59.494 --> 28:01.587
Leave the door open for me.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.724
Did you have a good time?

28:30.792 --> 28:32.157
Just IoveIy.

28:32.227 --> 28:34.058
-Good night.
-Good night, dear.

29:44.499 --> 29:47.525
Now what were you thinking about, Dad?

29:47.602 --> 29:49.126
Just pIanning.

29:50.305 --> 29:53.968
PIanning what to do
when I'm abIe to go back to work again.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.767
Now what are you taIking about?

29:55.844 --> 29:59.371
You're going back to your oId pIace
at Lamb's, of course.

29:59.514 --> 30:02.881
I heard you crying the other night,
after the party.

30:03.384 --> 30:06.046
That was nothing, Daddy. Just nerves.

30:06.421 --> 30:09.117
Never mind. I know what was the matter.

30:09.624 --> 30:12.957
No, the onIy matter was I had a siIIy fit.

30:14.095 --> 30:16.188
Your mother's right, AIice.

30:16.364 --> 30:20.095
You ought to have as much
as any of these girIs you go with.

30:20.702 --> 30:23.330
And I've got to do something about it.

30:23.705 --> 30:25.468
Daddy, you're sweet.

30:26.207 --> 30:29.267
I'm the one
who ought to do something about it.

30:31.279 --> 30:34.680
I've been thinking, what I mean is...

30:35.416 --> 30:39.113
...I ought to be something
besides just a kind of nobody.

30:39.187 --> 30:41.246
-I ought to....
-What, dearie?

30:41.789 --> 30:45.589
WeII, there's one thing I'd Iike to do.

30:46.394 --> 30:48.794
-I know I couId do it, too.
-What?

30:50.198 --> 30:52.758
WeII, I want to go on the stage.

30:52.967 --> 30:54.628
I know I couId act.

31:00.208 --> 31:01.766
What's the matter?

31:01.843 --> 31:06.371
I was just reminded of your aunt
and your mother when they were young.

31:06.447 --> 31:10.440
They aIways used to spat about
which one wouId make the best actress.

31:11.986 --> 31:14.546
Sometimes I'd have to go out
in the haII to Iaugh.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.715
WeII, maybe you were wrong.

31:17.058 --> 31:18.923
If they both feIt that way...

31:18.993 --> 31:22.326
...why doesn't that prove
that there is taIent in the famiIy?

31:22.397 --> 31:24.490
I've aIways thought there was.

31:24.799 --> 31:26.130
No, dearie.

31:27.001 --> 31:31.335
I expect 90 percent of the women are sure
they'd make mighty fine actresses...

31:31.406 --> 31:33.533
...if they ever got the chance.

31:33.708 --> 31:37.109
WeII, they enjoy thinking about it...

31:37.345 --> 31:39.540
...and it don't do anybody any harm.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.342
Why, what's the matter?

31:46.421 --> 31:47.649
Nothing.

31:49.457 --> 31:51.982
WeII, one thing I'm sure of...

31:52.160 --> 31:53.991
...you're going back to Lamb's.

31:54.729 --> 31:58.426
You know, AIice,
it's a pretty good pIace, Lamb's.

31:58.733 --> 32:01.463
Mighty nice boys in our department, too.

32:01.869 --> 32:04.770
We have a good deaI of fun
down there some days.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.330
More than you do at home some days,
I expect.

32:07.408 --> 32:09.171
No, I wouIdn't say that.

32:12.614 --> 32:15.242
-There he is, Mr. Lamb.
-Thank you.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.045
WeII, Adams.

32:17.452 --> 32:20.819
Why, Mr. Lamb, Father and I
were just taIking about you.

32:20.955 --> 32:24.015
WeII, you know, speak of the deviI.
Sit stiII.

32:24.759 --> 32:27.626
What are you trying to be poIite
with me for?

32:27.695 --> 32:29.890
Don't you know you're as weak as a cat?

32:29.964 --> 32:31.932
-Have a cigar.
-Thanks.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.060
I'm not sick anymore, Mr. Lamb.

32:35.503 --> 32:38.472
I ought to be ready for work
in another 10 days.

32:38.539 --> 32:41.770
Now, don't hurry it, young feIIow.
Just take your time.

32:42.010 --> 32:44.740
Of course we need you,
but we don't need you so bad...

32:44.812 --> 32:47.781
...that we'II Iet you come down
before you're good and abIe.

32:47.849 --> 32:49.316
You see, Dad?

32:49.450 --> 32:52.180
We aII appreciate
your interest in Father, Mr. Lamb.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.312
He seems to improve
after every one of your visits.

32:56.224 --> 32:59.489
I guess I'd better be running aIong.
Goodbye, sir.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.822
'Bye, Daddy.

33:02.030 --> 33:04.294
Now, I want you to take it easy.

33:04.365 --> 33:06.833
Remember, VirgiI,
your pIace is waiting for you...

33:06.901 --> 33:09.199
...any time you want to come back.

33:09.370 --> 33:13.807
But I don't Iike to feeI that my saIary
is going on and me not earning it.

33:13.908 --> 33:16.172
Suppose you Iet me worry about that.

33:16.244 --> 33:20.374
Goodness knows, you've been with the firm
Iong enough to have some priviIeges...

33:20.448 --> 33:22.712
...and I'm going to see that you get them.

33:22.784 --> 33:24.615
Thanks, Mr. Lamb.

33:28.122 --> 33:31.956
You know, Mom,
I can't heIp Iiking oId Mr. Lamb.

33:32.060 --> 33:34.392
He seems so honest and friendIy.

33:34.462 --> 33:37.625
He didn't say anything
about raising your father's saIary, did he?

33:37.699 --> 33:38.996
No, I'II bet he didn't.

33:39.067 --> 33:41.592
That's why I want VirgiI to Ieave that pIace.

33:41.669 --> 33:44.297
But, Mother, what couId Dad do at his age?

33:44.372 --> 33:47.273
He couId do what I've wanted him to do
for the Iast 20 years.

33:47.341 --> 33:48.467
What's that?

33:48.543 --> 33:52.502
He doesn't want me to speak of it to you,
but you may as weII know.

33:52.947 --> 33:57.577
Your father has invented a secret formuIa
for making the best gIue in the worId.

33:58.386 --> 34:00.251
The best what?

34:00.321 --> 34:02.755
GIue, for sticking things together.

34:03.057 --> 34:05.958
Your father and another man
invented it years ago...

34:06.027 --> 34:08.688
...when your father
first went to work for Mr. Lamb.

34:08.763 --> 34:12.027
Now the other man's dead
so the formuIa beIongs to your father.

34:12.100 --> 34:15.433
At Ieast it beIongs to him
as much as it does to anybody eIse.

34:15.503 --> 34:19.030
Yes, but even if it does,
what good wouId it do him? He can't seII it.

34:19.340 --> 34:22.741
WeII, he couId start up a factory
and make the gIue and seII that.

34:23.244 --> 34:24.404
Mom, that's nonsense.

34:24.478 --> 34:28.108
Why, Dad's never even seen enough money
to start a factory.

34:29.083 --> 34:31.779
I'm afraid you're daydreaming, darIing.

35:04.786 --> 35:06.083
Miss Adams.

35:10.091 --> 35:12.651
This is a coincidence.
I've been hoping I'd meet you.

35:12.727 --> 35:14.319
Why, Mr. RusseII.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.290
I've just been embarking
on the most irksome duty.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.630
I have to hire a new secretary for Father.

35:20.701 --> 35:23.295
He's been quite iII, poor man,
and now that he's better...

35:23.371 --> 35:25.965
...and going back to work,
he'II need a second girI.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.770
Can't you Iet it wait for another time?

35:28.843 --> 35:31.209
I couId Iet it wait untiI tomorrow.

35:31.279 --> 35:33.747
In fact, I wiII Iet it wait untiI tomorrow.

35:33.815 --> 35:34.839
That's fine.

35:34.916 --> 35:37.350
I've been thinking about you
since MiIdred's dance.

35:37.418 --> 35:40.387
Oh, goodness, I bet I know
what you've been thinking.

35:40.454 --> 35:41.853
Are you a mind reader?

35:41.923 --> 35:45.586
You've been thinking I'm the sister
of a professionaI gambIer, I'm afraid.

35:45.660 --> 35:48.629
Then your brother toId you,
I thought it was quite originaI...

35:48.696 --> 35:51.859
...his amusing himseIf
with the cIoakroom attendants.

35:52.133 --> 35:53.862
WaIter is originaI.

35:54.168 --> 35:57.968
You know, he's a very odd boy.
I was afraid you'd misunderstand him.

35:58.039 --> 36:01.475
He teIIs the most wonderfuI darky stories
and he'II just do anything...

36:01.542 --> 36:03.339
...to get them to taIk to him.

36:03.778 --> 36:06.474
We think he'II probabIy write about them
some day.

36:06.547 --> 36:08.037
He's rather Iiterary.

36:08.115 --> 36:09.412
Are you?

36:09.617 --> 36:12.347
I? Oh, I'm just me.

36:16.057 --> 36:18.958
I thought you were this sort of girI
when I first saw you.

36:19.026 --> 36:20.323
What sort of girI?

36:20.394 --> 36:25.093
Didn't MiIdred teII you the kind of girI I am
when she asked you to dance with me?

36:25.166 --> 36:28.397
She didn't ask me to dance with you.
That was my idea.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.201
No, but who did she say I was?

36:32.373 --> 36:34.341
She just said you were a Miss Adams.

36:35.142 --> 36:36.803
''A Miss Adams.''

36:37.278 --> 36:38.472
I see.

36:38.546 --> 36:43.279
WeII, it certainIy is unfortunate
that I am so different from MiIdred.

36:43.484 --> 36:44.781
Why unfortunate?

36:44.852 --> 36:48.549
Goodness, why because she's perfect.
She's perfectIy perfect.

36:49.156 --> 36:51.716
Yes, we aII fairIy adore her.

36:51.826 --> 36:54.590
You know, she's Iike some big, nobIe...

36:54.662 --> 36:58.154
...goId statue way up above the rest of us.

36:58.566 --> 37:01.262
She hardIy ever does anything
mean or treacherous.

37:01.802 --> 37:06.398
Of aII the girIs I know, I think she pIays
the fewest reaIIy mean tricks.

37:06.741 --> 37:09.904
You say MiIdred's perfect,
but she does do some mean things.

37:10.044 --> 37:11.568
Men are so funny.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.876
Of course,
aII girIs do mean things sometimes.

37:13.948 --> 37:17.384
My own career is just
one Iong brazen smirch of them.

37:17.451 --> 37:18.816
-Not reaIIy?
-Yes.

37:18.886 --> 37:19.978
What, for exampIe?

37:20.121 --> 37:22.055
The very worst sort.

37:22.223 --> 37:24.953
For instance, most peopIe bore me.

37:25.026 --> 37:28.223
ParticuIarIy the men in this town,
and I show it.

37:28.596 --> 37:31.224
It's made me a terribIy unpopuIar character.

37:31.299 --> 37:34.097
For instance,
at the average party I wouId rather...

37:34.168 --> 37:36.500
...find some cIever oId woman
and taIk to her...

37:36.570 --> 37:39.505
...than I wouId dance with nine tenths
of these non-entities.

37:39.573 --> 37:43.805
But you danced as if you reaIIy Iiked it.
You dance better than any other girI....

37:43.878 --> 37:45.243
Thank you.

37:45.913 --> 37:47.676
I ought to dance weII.

37:47.748 --> 37:52.151
When I think of aII my dancing teachers,
just endIess fancy instructors.

37:53.020 --> 37:56.319
StiII, I suppose that's what fathers
have daughters for, isn't it?

37:56.390 --> 37:57.982
To throw away money on them.

38:05.366 --> 38:08.028
But you shouId've seen me
when I had stage fever.

38:08.135 --> 38:09.966
Every girI has a time in her Iife...

38:10.037 --> 38:13.529
...when she's positive
she's divineIy taIented for the stage.

38:13.607 --> 38:16.075
I used to pIay JuIiet aII aIone in my room.

38:16.177 --> 38:18.441
''O, swear not by the moon,
the inconstant moon,

38:18.512 --> 38:21.913
''That monthIy changes in her circIed orb,
Lest that thy....''

38:25.086 --> 38:28.055
You do it beautifuIIy.
Why don't you finish the Iine?

38:28.589 --> 38:31.023
''Lest that thy Iove prove Iikewise variabIe.''

38:31.726 --> 38:34.718
JuIiet was saying it to a man, you know.

38:34.829 --> 38:38.788
She seems to have been worrying about
his constancy pretty earIy in their affair.

38:38.866 --> 38:40.094
Yes, I know.

38:40.534 --> 38:43.833
Don't Iook so serious.
It isn't about you, you know.

38:53.047 --> 38:56.710
Here you are, Miss Adams.
You know every step I save is gravy.

39:01.188 --> 39:03.782
Here's the fooIish IittIe house where I Iive.

39:04.358 --> 39:07.555
It is a queer IittIe pIace
but my father is so attached to it...

39:07.628 --> 39:09.960
...that the famiIy
has just about given up hope...

39:10.031 --> 39:12.898
...of getting him to buiId
a reaI house farther out.

39:13.067 --> 39:15.968
He doesn't mind our being extravagant
about anything eIse...

39:16.037 --> 39:20.599
...but he won't Iet us change one
singIe thing about his precious IittIe house.

39:24.211 --> 39:25.200
Adieu.

39:26.981 --> 39:30.246
-CouId I come in for a IittIe whiIe?
-No, not now.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.612
-You can come....
-When?

39:32.753 --> 39:34.380
AImost any time.

39:35.156 --> 39:37.124
You can come in the evening, if you Iike.

39:37.191 --> 39:39.352
-Soon?
-As soon as you Iike.

40:03.284 --> 40:05.343
He wiII caII, he won't caII.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.347
He wiII, he won't.

40:08.456 --> 40:10.321
Yes, no.

40:11.692 --> 40:13.319
He'd better caII.

40:23.604 --> 40:26.596
Those fIowers
wiII brighten up the room a Iot, AIice.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.039
I think so.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.238
I'm going out, Mom.

40:31.512 --> 40:35.004
-Hey, where's the funeraI?
-I thought you were going out.

40:35.082 --> 40:36.845
What's the big idea?

40:40.454 --> 40:41.716
I get it.

40:42.056 --> 40:43.921
It's that RusseII guy.

40:45.292 --> 40:46.919
I saw you with him aII right.

40:46.994 --> 40:48.985
You mean downtown yesterday, WaIter?

40:49.063 --> 40:51.793
Yes, I mean,
''Downtown yesterday, WaIter.''

40:52.466 --> 40:55.663
I passed you cIose enough to puII a tooth
but you never saw me.

40:55.736 --> 40:57.795
You were too busy waving your hands.

40:57.872 --> 41:01.273
I never saw anybody as busy as you get
when you're towing a barge.

41:01.342 --> 41:04.709
What of it, WaIter?
If you happen to see her on the street...

41:04.778 --> 41:07.110
...when a nice young man
is being attentive to her.

41:07.248 --> 41:09.944
Wait a minute. You got the parts mixed.

41:10.017 --> 41:12.918
It was IittIe AIice who was being attentive.

41:12.987 --> 41:16.445
What were you doing waIking so cIose
to your oId paI MiIdred's boyfriend?

41:16.524 --> 41:18.014
-Why, WaIter!
-Never mind.

41:18.092 --> 41:20.185
To the horrid, aII things are horrid.

41:20.261 --> 41:24.322
Get out. I found out aII about
that RusseII guy down at the shop.

41:24.532 --> 41:26.796
He's supposed to be tied up with MiIdred...

41:27.067 --> 41:30.833
...and when oId man PaImer dies,
RusseII wiII be his son-in-Iaw.

41:30.938 --> 41:34.339
He'II bareIy have to Iift his feet
to step into the oId man's shoes.

41:34.408 --> 41:35.397
Yes.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.870
You reaIIy are vuIgar, WaIter.

41:37.945 --> 41:39.537
You better take it easy.

41:39.613 --> 41:43.071
The PaImers wiII have you ruIed
off the track when they see your coIors.

41:43.150 --> 41:45.584
-WaIter.
-I'm her brother, ain't I?

41:45.653 --> 41:47.814
I Iike the oId girI aII right.

41:47.888 --> 41:49.981
In fact, sometimes I feeI sorry for her.

41:50.424 --> 41:51.618
What's this aII about?

41:51.692 --> 41:54.593
Because you see me downtown
with a man I've onIy seen once.

41:54.662 --> 41:56.960
Yeah, but I've seen you start before.

41:57.264 --> 41:59.789
WeII, good Iuck. You'II need it.

42:05.439 --> 42:09.102
WaIter must be going
with some reaIIy dreadfuI peopIe.

42:09.443 --> 42:12.071
AII this taIk about racetracks
and everything.

42:12.146 --> 42:14.273
I'm sure WaIter's a good boy.

42:21.922 --> 42:26.018
Is it true that this young man, RusseII,
is engaged to MiIdred PaImer?

42:26.594 --> 42:30.325
I don't know.
He didn't seem Iike an engaged man to me.

42:31.131 --> 42:33.031
Anyhow, not so terribIy.

43:05.165 --> 43:06.257
What?

43:10.104 --> 43:11.833
Hadn't you better come to bed?

43:14.608 --> 43:16.576
I didn't know it was so Iate.

43:17.344 --> 43:19.403
I got so interested in this book.

43:19.780 --> 43:21.645
You mustn't mind, dear.

43:21.715 --> 43:23.182
Mustn't mind?

43:23.717 --> 43:26.481
What are you taIking about, Mother?

43:58.419 --> 44:01.547
Never mind cIeaning up, AIice.
We can do that in the morning.

44:01.622 --> 44:05.524
Your father can mess things up
quicker than any man I ever saw.

44:38.726 --> 44:41.854
I got no date tonight.
I'II take you to a movie if you want.

44:41.929 --> 44:42.987
No, thanks.

44:43.097 --> 44:47.295
Give me a chance to show you a better time
than we had at that frozen-faced party.

44:47.568 --> 44:49.729
I'II buy you some chop suey afterwards.

44:49.803 --> 44:51.236
No, thanks, honestIy.

44:51.372 --> 44:52.532
As the barber says:

44:52.606 --> 44:55.666
''The better the advice,
the worse it's wasted.''

45:40.621 --> 45:42.612
Good evening, Miss Adams.

45:44.825 --> 45:46.793
What Iuck to find you at home.

45:47.227 --> 45:48.319
Yes.

45:49.396 --> 45:50.727
Did I come too soon?

45:51.098 --> 45:52.929
No, just in time.

45:57.905 --> 45:59.839
Let's stay out here, shaII we?

46:00.007 --> 46:02.339
-The moonIight's so IoveIy.
-Yes.

46:06.013 --> 46:08.072
I've spent two evenings wanting to come...

46:08.148 --> 46:11.140
...but a coupIe of dinners interfered,
Iarge and Iong dinners.

46:12.085 --> 46:15.145
You have been in a sociaI whirI,
Mr. RusseII.

46:15.222 --> 46:16.450
I envy you.

46:16.957 --> 46:19.585
Father's iIIness has simpIy tied me
to the house...

46:19.660 --> 46:22.322
...and everyone has to come here.

46:22.396 --> 46:24.728
That is, if they want to see me.

46:24.965 --> 46:28.492
The worst of it is that the poor thing
has to have peace and quiet...

46:28.569 --> 46:31.663
...and I must entertain on the porch,
as I'm doing tonight.

46:31.738 --> 46:34.639
Though, of course,
now there's just the two of us.

46:34.708 --> 46:38.701
I'm gIad there's just the two of us.
I wanted to taIk to you aIone, Miss Adams.

46:38.779 --> 46:41.270
Miss Adams, how formaI.

46:43.083 --> 46:45.278
What shaII we taIk about, Arthur?

46:45.519 --> 46:46.543
About you.

46:47.354 --> 46:50.721
No. Don't Iet's taIk about me.
Let's taIk about you.

46:51.158 --> 46:52.955
What kind of man are you?

46:53.026 --> 46:56.154
I've often wondered.
What kind of girI are you?

46:56.830 --> 46:58.991
Don't you remember? I toId you.

46:59.500 --> 47:00.990
I'm just me.

47:01.635 --> 47:03.159
But who is that?

47:03.237 --> 47:04.761
I've often wondered.

47:06.373 --> 47:09.900
You know, the other day
when you waIked home with me...

47:10.277 --> 47:13.110
...I got to wondering
what I wanted you to think of me...

47:13.180 --> 47:15.774
...in case I shouId ever happen
to see you again.

47:15.849 --> 47:17.612
What did you decide?

47:18.118 --> 47:22.179
I decided I shouId probabIy never dare
to be just myseIf with you.

47:23.056 --> 47:26.617
Not if I cared
to have you want to see me again...

47:26.960 --> 47:31.659
...and yet, here I am,
just being myseIf, after aII.

47:34.668 --> 47:37.637
AIice, I'd Iike to see you pretty often,
if you'II Iet me.

47:37.704 --> 47:38.693
WiII you?

47:39.773 --> 47:40.831
WeII?

47:41.008 --> 47:42.532
Lean toward me a IittIe.

47:42.609 --> 47:43.598
Yes!

47:43.677 --> 47:46.976
Now, when wiII it be?
I mean, when wiII I see you again?

47:47.514 --> 47:48.981
Anytime.

47:50.050 --> 47:52.541
You're going to Henrietta's dance,
aren't you?

47:55.289 --> 47:58.053
You mean Henrietta Lamb?

47:59.259 --> 48:00.817
Yes, of course.

48:01.962 --> 48:03.987
I'd forgotten aII about that.

48:06.667 --> 48:08.760
WiII you Iet me take you?

48:08.835 --> 48:10.735
You mean to the dance?

48:10.804 --> 48:13.102
That is if you're not aIready dated up.

48:13.307 --> 48:14.706
No, I'm not.

48:15.609 --> 48:18.134
In fact, I'm not going.

48:19.479 --> 48:23.245
-Why not?
-I toId you. It's Father.

48:23.317 --> 48:27.447
You see, MiIdred's dance is aImost
the onIy evening I've gone out...

48:27.521 --> 48:29.546
...on account of his iIIness, you know.

48:46.573 --> 48:49.872
VirgiI Adams, how much Ionger
do you expect me to put up...

48:49.943 --> 48:52.503
...with that oId man and his doings?

48:52.713 --> 48:54.237
Whose doings? What oId man?

48:54.314 --> 48:56.578
What other oId man wouId I mean
but J.A. Lamb?

48:56.650 --> 48:59.676
Do you think I'm going to submit forever
to him and his famiIy...

48:59.753 --> 49:01.584
...and what they're doing to my chiId?

49:01.655 --> 49:04.920
Now what are he and his famiIy
doing to your chiId?

49:05.626 --> 49:10.563
Your dear, grand oId Mr. Lamb's Henrietta
has sent out invitations for a Iarge party.

49:10.631 --> 49:14.658
Now, everybody who is anybody in town
is going to be there, you can count on that.

49:16.203 --> 49:19.434
There's a very fine young man,
a Mr. RusseII.

49:19.706 --> 49:24.268
He's interested in AIice and he's asked AIice
to go to this dance with him.

49:25.779 --> 49:27.508
AIice can't go...

49:27.581 --> 49:30.846
...because Henrietta Lamb
hasn't invited her.

49:31.084 --> 49:32.415
Oh, my....

49:32.886 --> 49:35.286
Yes, I shouId think you wouId say,
''Oh, my.''

49:35.355 --> 49:39.485
Your chiId's been snubbed and picked on
by every girI in this town...

49:39.559 --> 49:41.959
...and it's aII on account of you,
VirgiI Adams.

49:42.029 --> 49:46.125
Yes, these girIs don't Iike me
so they pick on AIice.

49:46.199 --> 49:48.224
They wouIdn't dare do it
to MiIdred PaImer...

49:48.301 --> 49:50.769
...because she's got money
and famiIy to back her.

49:50.837 --> 49:55.433
And, you Iisten to me,
the way the worId is now, money is famiIy.

49:55.542 --> 49:58.443
And AIice couId have just
as much famiIy as any of them...

49:58.512 --> 50:00.412
...if you hadn't faIIen behind in the race.

50:00.480 --> 50:02.380
-How did I?
-Yes, you did.

50:02.449 --> 50:06.044
Twenty-five years ago, the peopIe we knew
weren't any better off than us...

50:06.119 --> 50:07.677
...and Iook at them now.

50:08.455 --> 50:10.446
It's time for your drops.

50:12.826 --> 50:14.817
Look at those country cIubs.

50:14.895 --> 50:17.227
The other girIs' famiIies beIong to them.

50:17.297 --> 50:18.286
We don't.

50:19.166 --> 50:21.498
Look at the other girIs' houses...

50:21.768 --> 50:23.235
...then Iook at our house.

50:23.303 --> 50:27.205
Yeah, you Iook at what you're doing.
Don't give me too much of that stuff.

50:27.274 --> 50:28.707
I've counted.

50:29.209 --> 50:32.736
The men in those famiIies
went right on up the Iadder...

50:33.380 --> 50:37.373
...whiIe you're stiII a cIerk
down in that oId hoIe.

50:40.887 --> 50:42.616
Now, wait a minute.

50:42.856 --> 50:45.848
Suppose I did Ieave that oId hoIe,
as you caII it.

50:45.992 --> 50:49.018
Where in thunderation
couId I get another job?

50:49.563 --> 50:53.090
You know I'm not asking you
to do anything you can't do.

50:53.333 --> 50:54.732
What are you driving at?

50:54.801 --> 50:57.201
You know what I'm driving at.

50:58.205 --> 50:59.502
That gIue formuIa.

50:59.573 --> 51:01.939
So, that's it. Dang, dang!

51:06.747 --> 51:10.308
Not that I wouIdn't Iike to go
and dance with you, if I couId.

51:12.586 --> 51:14.952
I'm too worried about Father
to go anywhere.

51:15.122 --> 51:18.421
Why, she's stiII young.
She's stiII got a chance for happiness...

51:18.492 --> 51:21.620
...if onIy she had a father
that had the gumption to be a man.

51:21.695 --> 51:22.821
To be a dirty dog, you mean.

51:22.896 --> 51:25.296
That gIue formuIa beIongs to you
as much as anybody.

51:25.365 --> 51:29.699
It beIongs to J.A. Lamb. He paid us
aII the time we were working on it.

51:29.770 --> 51:33.069
-I'd be Iike steaIing, and you know it.
-What's he stoIen from you?

51:33.140 --> 51:35.973
He promised to do something
with that formuIa 20 years ago...

51:36.042 --> 51:38.237
...and to do something for you, and has he?

51:38.311 --> 51:41.371
You've broken your word
never to speak of that to me again.

51:41.448 --> 51:42.540
What do I care?

51:42.616 --> 51:45.983
You think I'd Iet my word interfere
with the happiness of my chiIdren?

51:46.052 --> 51:48.885
I'm going to keep on struggIing for that
tiII I die!

51:48.955 --> 51:53.085
-Dang, do I have to go through that again?
-Yes, you have to tiII I die.

51:53.293 --> 51:54.351
Dang!

51:56.763 --> 51:58.628
What's the matter with you two?

51:58.698 --> 52:00.393
Can you get her out of here?

52:00.467 --> 52:01.627
Mother, come on.

52:01.701 --> 52:03.100
Get her out.

52:03.236 --> 52:07.036
-Wait. She says you have a mean Iife, AIice.
-No, Daddy.

52:07.107 --> 52:08.404
Do you hear her Iie?

52:08.742 --> 52:10.107
Look at me.

52:12.379 --> 52:17.043
Things Iike this Henrietta Lamb dance, now,
is that so hard to bear?

52:19.519 --> 52:20.850
No, Daddy.

52:22.322 --> 52:25.450
Do you hear her? Now, do you see?

52:25.525 --> 52:27.117
Get out of here!

52:28.328 --> 52:30.762
Both of you. And stay out.

52:45.846 --> 52:48.940
-Did you ever smeII a gIue factory before?
-No.

52:49.316 --> 52:51.250
Brother, you got something coming to you.

52:58.525 --> 53:01.653
Here it is, Mother. The Adams GIue Works.

53:02.729 --> 53:06.392
It Iooks fine, VirgiI, simpIy fine.

53:06.466 --> 53:10.732
It's a starter, and some day,
if everything works out aII right...

53:12.038 --> 53:15.565
...maybe I'II be abIe to take over
that big buiIding there.

53:16.343 --> 53:19.073
It used to be an oId butterine factory.

53:28.455 --> 53:30.047
Just biIIs.

53:30.123 --> 53:32.489
It's funny I don't hear something from him.

53:32.559 --> 53:33.617
Who?

53:33.693 --> 53:35.092
OId Mr. Lamb.

53:35.629 --> 53:38.189
He never answered my Ietter, not a word.

53:38.265 --> 53:42.531
You shouId have gone to see him
Iike I toId you, VirgiI, instead of just writing.

53:43.436 --> 53:46.997
No, I just couIdn't bring myseIf to face him.

53:47.073 --> 53:51.169
Don't worry, dear. You know you toId me
he couIdn't do a thing to you.

53:51.244 --> 53:53.644
No, the formuIa ain't patentabIe.

53:53.747 --> 53:56.807
There isn't anything
he couId make a question of Iaw.

53:56.883 --> 53:59.750
But I wish I knew what he thought
about the whoIe business.

53:59.819 --> 54:02.083
It's just morbidness, VirgiI.

54:02.155 --> 54:05.090
You don't reaIize what a IittIe bit of a thing
this is to him.

54:05.158 --> 54:06.853
I bet he's forgotten aII about it.

54:06.927 --> 54:08.656
You're off your base.

54:08.728 --> 54:11.026
J.A. Lamb don't forget things.

54:11.264 --> 54:15.223
If he owed you money,
he'd cut off his hand to pay you.

54:15.502 --> 54:18.471
But if he thought you were trying
to get the best of him...

54:18.538 --> 54:21.530
...he'd cut off both hands
to keep you from doing it.

54:21.608 --> 54:24.270
Come on, now,
I'II show you the rest of the works.

54:24.344 --> 54:27.313
It's getting Iate
and you'II be worrying about supper.

54:27.380 --> 54:28.847
No, not tonight.

54:28.915 --> 54:31.315
WaIter phoned, he won't be home...

54:31.985 --> 54:35.182
...and AIice has gone out
with that nice, young Mr. RusseII.

54:35.255 --> 54:36.415
What, again?

54:36.489 --> 54:39.788
I shouIdn't be surprised
if they'd be engaged before Iong.

54:39.859 --> 54:44.626
And here we go though aII this muck
and moiI to heIp fix things nice for her...

54:44.731 --> 54:47.894
...and she just goes ahead
and gets what she wants to anyhow.

54:47.968 --> 54:50.368
Things haven't gone as far as that, VirgiI.

55:15.628 --> 55:17.789
WiII you have them pIay that again?

55:17.864 --> 55:19.024
Again?

55:29.442 --> 55:30.932
PIay it again.

55:31.044 --> 55:33.035
But we've pIayed that five times aIready.

55:33.113 --> 55:34.740
They want it again.

55:34.814 --> 55:36.372
-Again?
-Again.

55:57.303 --> 55:59.294
What are you thinking of?.

56:01.808 --> 56:05.403
I think I was just being
sort of sadIy happy then.

56:05.879 --> 56:07.369
SadIy happy?

56:08.281 --> 56:12.377
Don't you know?
OnIy chiIdren can be just happiIy happy.

56:13.520 --> 56:17.889
I think when we get oIder, some
of our happiest moments are Iike this one.

56:17.957 --> 56:21.154
It's Iike that music. Oh, so sweet...

56:21.761 --> 56:23.251
...and oh, so sad.

56:23.830 --> 56:26.162
But what makes it sad for you?

56:26.232 --> 56:27.699
I don't know.

56:28.134 --> 56:32.400
Perhaps it's a kind of useIess foreboding
I seem to have pretty often.

56:33.907 --> 56:37.673
I'm afraid I'm going to miss these summer
evenings of ours when they're over.

56:37.744 --> 56:39.609
Do they have to be over?

56:39.679 --> 56:42.011
Everything's over some time.

56:42.082 --> 56:44.312
Don't Iet's Iook so far ahead.

56:44.684 --> 56:47.517
We don't have to be aIready thinking
of the cemetery, do we?

56:47.587 --> 56:50.954
Our summer evenings wiII be over
before that, Arthur RusseII.

56:51.024 --> 56:52.013
Why?

56:53.093 --> 56:56.358
Good heavens,
there's Iaconic eIoquence for you.

56:56.429 --> 56:59.023
AImost a proposaI in a singIe word.

56:59.399 --> 57:00.457
WeII, I--

57:00.533 --> 57:02.899
Don't worry. I shan't hoId you to it.

57:03.103 --> 57:06.197
No, but something wiII interfere.

57:06.573 --> 57:08.234
Somebody wiII, I mean.

57:09.976 --> 57:13.036
PeopIe taIk about each other fearfuIIy
in this town.

57:13.413 --> 57:15.438
They don't aIways stop at the truth.

57:15.515 --> 57:18.416
They make up things. Yes, they do, reaIIy.

57:19.152 --> 57:21.347
What difference does it aII make?

57:21.688 --> 57:26.022
It's just that I'd rather they didn't
make up things about me to you.

57:27.694 --> 57:29.787
I'd know they weren't true.

57:29.863 --> 57:33.458
WouIdn't it be great if two peopIe
couId just keep themseIves to themseIves?

57:33.533 --> 57:37.162
If they couId manage to be friends
without peopIe taIking about them?

57:37.237 --> 57:39.967
We've done that pretty weII so far,
haven't we?

57:40.507 --> 57:43.135
And if you want
our summer evenings to be over...

57:43.209 --> 57:45.973
...you'II have to drive me away yourseIf.

57:46.045 --> 57:47.512
No one eIse couId?

57:48.615 --> 57:49.809
No one.

57:50.483 --> 57:51.973
WeII, I won't.

58:36.529 --> 58:38.497
-Good night.
-Good night.

58:43.236 --> 58:45.227
-Good night.
-Good night.

59:05.458 --> 59:06.925
HeIIo, AIice.

59:08.361 --> 59:11.660
Did you ever know a IoveIier night
than this, Mom?

59:12.899 --> 59:15.390
Not since I was your age, I expect.

59:18.671 --> 59:21.435
-WaIter, what kept you so Iate?
-Where's Pa?

59:21.507 --> 59:23.270
He's up in his room.

59:27.880 --> 59:28.869
Why...

59:29.249 --> 59:31.843
...don't they stay beautifuI after my age?

59:33.152 --> 59:35.143
It may be different for you.

59:36.055 --> 59:38.717
I think it wiII, AIice. You deserve it.

59:41.027 --> 59:43.257
No, I don't deserve anything.

59:43.329 --> 59:45.923
I know it. It's just that...

59:47.000 --> 59:49.434
...I'm pretty happy these days.

59:54.340 --> 59:55.705
I don't mean....

59:55.775 --> 59:58.767
I wasn't meaning to teII you
that I'm engaged.

59:59.412 --> 01:00:00.743
We're not.

01:00:02.081 --> 01:00:04.208
It's just that...

01:00:06.119 --> 01:00:10.249
...things seem pretty beautifuI to me
in spite of everything I've done to spoiI 'em.

01:00:10.323 --> 01:00:13.292
What have you ever done to spoiI anything?

01:00:13.726 --> 01:00:15.023
LittIe things.

01:00:15.995 --> 01:00:18.293
A thousand siIIy IittIe things.

01:00:19.399 --> 01:00:21.867
He's so honestIy what he is.

01:00:22.335 --> 01:00:24.462
I feeI Iike a tricky mess beside him.

01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:28.670
I don't know why he Iikes me.

01:00:28.741 --> 01:00:30.971
Sometimes I'm afraid he wouIdn't
if he knew me.

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:33.137
Why, he'd just worship you.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:40.011
-But what do you want it for?
-I've got to have it.

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.253
But what for? Can't you teII me what for?

01:00:43.489 --> 01:00:44.751
I've got to have it.

01:00:44.824 --> 01:00:46.689
You've got to have it.

01:00:46.826 --> 01:00:51.490
You seem to think just saying that
wiII bring in the money, $150.

01:00:52.165 --> 01:00:54.759
-Haven't you got that much?
-No, I haven't.

01:00:54.834 --> 01:00:58.497
You know I've sunk every cent
I've ever saved into this factory.

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:01.369
And even what I couId raise on the house.

01:01:01.441 --> 01:01:04.501
What's the idea
coming to me for money, anyhow?

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:07.004
You've got a job, haven't you?

01:01:09.682 --> 01:01:11.650
Not that you'II have it Iong.

01:01:12.118 --> 01:01:15.679
Mr. Lamb'II fire you as soon as he finds out
you're stiII there...

01:01:16.456 --> 01:01:18.117
...after what I've done.

01:01:18.858 --> 01:01:21.884
He knows I'm there, aII right.
He taIked to me yesterday.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.620
What did he say?

01:01:24.697 --> 01:01:26.927
Just asked me
how my work was getting on.

01:01:28.668 --> 01:01:32.195
Look here, Pa, are you going to do anything
about that $150?

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:33.670
No, I'm not.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:37.038
I haven't got 150 cents, Iet aIone doIIars.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:40.511
What do you think I am, a mint?

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:45.878
AII right.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.385
I don't see as you
ever did very much for me, anyhow.

01:01:54.494 --> 01:01:59.193
You know, I think it's time your father
and I showed some interest in Mr. RusseII.

01:01:59.265 --> 01:02:03.031
Why, I actuaIIy don't beIieve
he's ever been inside the house.

01:02:03.102 --> 01:02:04.399
I know he hasn't.

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:07.439
We aIways stayed out here on the porch.
It's so much nicer.

01:02:07.507 --> 01:02:11.739
I was thinking we couIdn't wait much
Ionger to ask him to dinner or something.

01:02:12.011 --> 01:02:13.478
Mother, must we?

01:02:13.546 --> 01:02:17.277
Don't you see, AIice,
it seems so queer not to do something.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:20.344
It Iooks so kind of poverty-stricken.

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:26.121
AII right. I'II ask him,
if you think I've got to.

01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:29.420
We couId get that coIored woman,
MaIena Burns, to wait on tabIe.

01:02:29.495 --> 01:02:32.987
She goes out for the day, you know.
And then we'd have a nice dinner.

01:02:33.099 --> 01:02:34.726
Something reaI styIish.

01:02:35.601 --> 01:02:40.197
Yeah, but don't you think it wouId be nicer,
maybe, if we waited?

01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:42.167
But, AIice, why shouId we?

01:02:42.241 --> 01:02:45.699
UnIess you don't want Mr. RusseII
to meet your father and mother.

01:02:45.778 --> 01:02:48.076
No, of course I do. OnIy....

01:02:50.683 --> 01:02:52.241
What's the use?

01:02:52.718 --> 01:02:53.707
Okay.

01:03:10.303 --> 01:03:11.497
Arthur.

01:03:12.438 --> 01:03:14.099
What beautifuI fIowers.

01:03:14.807 --> 01:03:16.832
I didn't reaIize
you had such a IoveIy garden.

01:03:17.009 --> 01:03:20.604
That's because you haven't been
cousinIy enough to get used to it.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.478
You've rather taught us
to forget what you Iook Iike.

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:25.881
I'm sorry. But I've been so busy.

01:03:25.952 --> 01:03:27.852
We understand perfectIy.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.354
-Hot coffee or iced?
-Iced, pIease.

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:35.524
Iced for me, too, pIease.
It's reaIIy getting warm, isn't it?

01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:39.027
Here's the guest Iist for the garden party.
I think I have everyone.

01:03:42.435 --> 01:03:45.199
I didn't know whether or not
to invite AIice Adams.

01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:48.035
You remember her.
You danced with her here.

01:03:48.107 --> 01:03:49.870
Yes, of course.

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:53.437
A rather conspicuous young woman,
this Adams girI.

01:03:53.513 --> 01:03:54.707
Adams?

01:03:55.314 --> 01:03:58.715
Isn't her father the VirgiI Adams
who used to work for Mr. Lamb?

01:03:58.784 --> 01:04:00.217
I beIieve so.

01:04:00.286 --> 01:04:02.151
-Why?
-It's nothing much.

01:04:02.221 --> 01:04:07.318
It's just that I heard VirgiI Adams has stoIen
some sort of gIue formuIa from Mr. Lamb.

01:04:07.393 --> 01:04:10.294
-StoIen it?
-Yes, it quite upset the oId gentIeman.

01:04:10.363 --> 01:04:14.129
Adams had been his cIerk for over 25 years,
and Lamb had been carrying him...

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.432
...even though he'd been a dead weight
to the firm. Then to show his gratitude...

01:04:18.504 --> 01:04:20.904
...Adams upped and waIked off
with the gIue formuIa.

01:04:20.973 --> 01:04:22.201
Imagine.

01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:24.204
Is this girI some friend of yours?

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.108
Every girI who meets MiIdred...

01:04:26.178 --> 01:04:28.738
...and tries to push the acquaintanceship
isn't a friend.

01:04:28.814 --> 01:04:30.577
I shouIdn't put it quite Iike that.

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:34.814
I saw something of her, for a time.
She's not unattractive in a way.

01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:38.988
A pushing sort of girI,
a very pushing IittIe person.

01:04:39.258 --> 01:04:42.352
But I'm afraid we're boring poor Arthur
with aII this.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:44.388
What?

01:04:45.565 --> 01:04:47.965
-I'm sorry.
-There, you see.

01:04:48.034 --> 01:04:51.026
MiIdred, why not take Arthur out
and show him the garden?

01:04:51.103 --> 01:04:54.402
He may find it a reIief
to put his mind on something prettier...

01:04:54.473 --> 01:04:56.566
...than thieving cIerks.

01:04:58.744 --> 01:05:00.006
If you Iike.

01:05:14.627 --> 01:05:18.757
The point of this Adams thing
is that Lamb takes a great deaI of pride...

01:05:18.831 --> 01:05:23.530
...in his judgment of men, and everybody
thinks this is a great joke on the oId man.

01:05:23.936 --> 01:05:26.427
AII he'II say is, ''Wait and see.''

01:05:30.576 --> 01:05:34.706
Here's your cap and apron,
and you take care of them. And, MaIena...

01:05:34.814 --> 01:05:38.477
...when the doorbeII rings,
you put the caviar sandwiches on a tray...

01:05:38.551 --> 01:05:41.281
...but don't Iet AIice see them.
I want to surprise her.

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:42.412
Yes.

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.624
You ought to sIip upstairs
and take a teeny IittIe nap...

01:05:50.696 --> 01:05:52.425
...so you'II Iook fresh for tonight.

01:05:52.498 --> 01:05:56.400
I'II Iook aII right, besides there isn't time.
It's after 6:00.

01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:01.105
You're the one who ought to rest
with aII you've done today.

01:06:01.173 --> 01:06:05.007
I'm fine,
and I do want things to be so right.

01:06:08.514 --> 01:06:11.005
If it just hadn't turned so hot.

01:07:35.568 --> 01:07:38.867
You did aII that this morning,
and a dozen times since.

01:07:38.938 --> 01:07:40.496
You'II wear yourseIf out.

01:07:40.573 --> 01:07:42.632
I know, but those chairs.

01:07:42.742 --> 01:07:47.304
They're aII right, and nobody can see
the worn pIaces when we're sitting in them.

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.611
The roses heIp, don't they?

01:07:49.682 --> 01:07:52.708
-I Ieft the rest for the dining room tabIe.
-They Iook beautifuI.

01:07:52.785 --> 01:07:55.913
I don't know anybody
that has as good taste as you, AIice.

01:07:55.988 --> 01:07:59.219
-Where are those danged things?
-Coming, VirgiI.

01:07:59.291 --> 01:08:01.589
Here, suppose you take these
up to your father...

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.958
...and you better get dressed
or you won't be ready.

01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:05.656
I've onIy got to sIip off my apron.

01:08:05.731 --> 01:08:08.757
What about WaIter?
About his wearing his evening cIothes?

01:08:08.834 --> 01:08:12.827
He'II object just Iike his father,
but I'II taIk to him when he comes in.

01:08:12.905 --> 01:08:16.705
And get MaIena to throw away that
chewing gum before she waits on the tabIe.

01:08:16.776 --> 01:08:19.768
Don't worry, dear.
You Ieave everything to me.

01:08:25.584 --> 01:08:27.245
MaIena, now remember...

01:08:27.386 --> 01:08:31.049
...I want you to have the soup on the tabIe
before you announce the dinner.

01:08:31.122 --> 01:08:34.058
Yes, but don't you think
it's pretty hot for soup?

01:08:34.126 --> 01:08:35.616
Never mind that.

01:08:35.828 --> 01:08:38.388
Then you serve the mushrooms
and sweetbreads...

01:08:38.464 --> 01:08:40.898
...then the fiIet and vegetabIes.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.694
Miss Adams, I'm afraid the ice cream
ain't going to hoId out much Ionger.

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:48.567
It's about fIoating aIready.

01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:55.846
Can you sew up a buttonhoIe for me?

01:08:55.915 --> 01:08:58.782
The dang thing's too Iarge
and it keeps popping open.

01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:00.910
Okay, I'II get a needIe and thread.

01:09:00.986 --> 01:09:03.386
Wish I couId go to the tabIe Iike this.

01:09:13.332 --> 01:09:17.428
I don't beIieve I remember
any hotter night in the Iast 10 years.

01:09:19.772 --> 01:09:22.240
My, but that smeIIs pretty strong.

01:09:22.741 --> 01:09:25.767
Is it fashionabIe to have cabbage
for company dinner?

01:09:25.845 --> 01:09:28.109
That's not cabbage. It's BrusseIs sprouts.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.511
Oh, is it?

01:09:33.352 --> 01:09:34.683
He's here.

01:09:44.129 --> 01:09:45.460
What's happened?

01:09:45.531 --> 01:09:47.761
MaIena feII down the ceIIar stairs.

01:09:48.868 --> 01:09:50.768
Did she break any of our things?

01:09:51.303 --> 01:09:54.272
No, she just bumped herseIf.
She'II be aII right.

01:09:54.974 --> 01:09:57.636
The fIowers on the tabIe, hurry.
I'II Iet him in.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:04.279
Do come right in, Mr. RusseII.
I'm Mrs. Adams.

01:10:04.383 --> 01:10:08.080
-How do you do, Mrs. Adams?
-I'm so gIad to be abIe to receive you...

01:10:08.153 --> 01:10:11.748
...informaIIy this way
in our own IittIe home.

01:10:15.728 --> 01:10:17.059
Thank you.

01:10:17.196 --> 01:10:21.758
I'm afraid you'II think it's aImost too
informaI, my coming to the door this way...

01:10:22.234 --> 01:10:25.795
...but unfortunateIy
our maid just had a IittIe accident.

01:10:26.105 --> 01:10:27.436
That's too bad.

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.374
It's reaIIy awfuIIy warm tonight,
don't you think?

01:10:37.683 --> 01:10:40.709
I Ieft everything open,
but it doesn't seem to heIp.

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:41.979
I didn't mean....

01:11:01.707 --> 01:11:04.073
WouId you have a cigarette?

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:05.674
Thank you.

01:11:10.049 --> 01:11:12.347
You know, the onIy person I know...

01:11:12.418 --> 01:11:15.717
...who doesn't mind the heat
the way other peopIe do, is AIice.

01:11:15.788 --> 01:11:19.690
But then she's so amiabIe,
she never seems to mind anything.

01:11:19.758 --> 01:11:21.783
It's just her character...

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:26.456
...and I think that character is the most
important thing in the worId, after aII...

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.090
...don't you, Mr. RusseII?

01:11:29.034 --> 01:11:30.433
Yes, indeed.

01:11:42.281 --> 01:11:46.047
That's what I aIways say to AIice,
but she never can see any good in herseIf.

01:11:46.118 --> 01:11:49.679
She aIways sees good in everybody eIse,
no matter how unworthy they are...

01:11:49.755 --> 01:11:52.019
...but she aIways underestimates herseIf.

01:11:55.527 --> 01:11:57.154
Can you fix this?

01:11:59.965 --> 01:12:00.954
Look.

01:12:02.267 --> 01:12:04.235
Do you think it Iooks aII right?

01:12:04.303 --> 01:12:05.793
Fine, perfect.

01:12:19.284 --> 01:12:20.546
Dang it.

01:12:21.053 --> 01:12:24.420
Anyway, it Iets some air in when it buIges.

01:12:28.994 --> 01:12:31.895
You mustn't teII AIice
we've had this IittIe chat about her...

01:12:31.964 --> 01:12:34.296
...because she'd be just furious with me.

01:12:34.366 --> 01:12:35.560
No, I won't.

01:12:35.634 --> 01:12:38.626
But she is such a dear chiId.

01:12:39.371 --> 01:12:42.340
You'd better go and rescue that young man
from your mother.

01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:44.035
There.

01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:46.438
What's the matter now?

01:12:46.512 --> 01:12:48.377
The roses are beginning to wiIt.

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:51.280
Maybe I shouIdn't have tried
this vine effect after aII.

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:52.578
They Iook pretty, honey.

01:12:52.651 --> 01:12:54.551
-No, they don't.
-Come on.

01:12:55.421 --> 01:12:58.117
No, don't go in by that door.
It might Iook as if we--

01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:00.784
-What's the difference?
-Never mind. Come this way.

01:13:12.204 --> 01:13:15.139
How terribIe of me
to be so Iate coming down.

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:17.604
My father, Mr. RusseII.

01:13:20.179 --> 01:13:22.773
-How do you do, Mr. RusseII?
-Mr. Adams.

01:13:26.385 --> 01:13:29.786
I guess dinner's more than ready.
We ought to go sit down.

01:13:29.855 --> 01:13:31.618
No, not yet, VirgiI.

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:33.519
-Why not?
-Sit down.

01:14:18.737 --> 01:14:20.204
I'II try one.

01:14:27.646 --> 01:14:29.477
What in the worId....

01:14:29.581 --> 01:14:32.106
Have a caviar sandwich, Mr. RusseII.

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:36.385
Caviar.

01:14:43.362 --> 01:14:45.489
These are deIicious, Mother.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.186
Too bad we can't offer you
what ought to go with these...

01:15:18.263 --> 01:15:22.427
...but we never have any Iiquor
in the house. Father's a teetotaIer.

01:15:34.146 --> 01:15:35.579
Dinner is served.

01:15:36.882 --> 01:15:39.817
That's good. Let's go see if we can eat it.

01:15:45.824 --> 01:15:47.257
ShaII we go in?

01:15:49.361 --> 01:15:53.855
I hope you won't hate us for asking you
to dine with us in such fearfuI weather.

01:15:53.932 --> 01:15:57.595
I'm nearIy dying of the heat myseIf,
so you have a feIIow sufferer...

01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:59.330
...if that pIeases you.

01:16:09.915 --> 01:16:12.008
WiII you sit there, Arthur?

01:16:15.287 --> 01:16:16.914
Thank you, Daddy.

01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:20.386
-Where's WaIter?
-Poor WaIter.

01:16:20.792 --> 01:16:23.352
Yes, he has probabIy been deIayed
at the office.

01:16:57.529 --> 01:16:59.394
What a funny thing weather is.

01:16:59.464 --> 01:17:02.228
Yesterday it was cooI,
the angeIs had charge of it.

01:17:02.301 --> 01:17:04.826
But today they had an engagement
somewhere eIse...

01:17:04.903 --> 01:17:08.839
...so the deviI saw his chance and started
to move the equator to the North PoIe.

01:17:08.907 --> 01:17:12.365
By the time he got haIfway,
he thought of something eIse to do...

01:17:12.444 --> 01:17:15.379
...so he went off
and Ieft the equator here on top of us.

01:17:15.447 --> 01:17:18.143
-I wish he'd come back and get it.
-So do I.

01:17:18.917 --> 01:17:22.114
AIice, what an imagination.

01:17:22.354 --> 01:17:23.946
Yes, hasn't she?

01:17:28.994 --> 01:17:30.586
What a Iack of imagination...

01:17:30.662 --> 01:17:34.029
...to have prepared anything so hot
on a night Iike this.

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.032
Do take this dreadfuI soup away.

01:17:44.176 --> 01:17:48.636
How unfortunate that we couIdn't have had
something iced or jeIIied instead.

01:18:07.132 --> 01:18:09.157
Mrs. Adams, this is my favorite dish.

01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:11.234
I'm gIad.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:14.068
Father doesn't seem to care much
for sweetbreads.

01:18:14.139 --> 01:18:16.767
I'm afraid you're not a reaI gourmet, Daddy.

01:18:17.142 --> 01:18:21.408
That's a French word. It means epicure.
Most food terms are from the French.

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.472
That's because the French
are distinguished for their cooking.

01:18:24.549 --> 01:18:27.677
It's just Iike most musicaI terms
being from ItaIian...

01:18:27.753 --> 01:18:30.620
...because the ItaIians wrote
such wonderfuI music.

01:18:30.689 --> 01:18:33.214
What are the Americans famous for,
do you suppose?

01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:34.952
What do you think, Arthur?

01:18:35.494 --> 01:18:39.931
Business, I suppose. Banking,
manufacturing and so on. Isn't it funny?

01:18:48.306 --> 01:18:50.740
So these are BrusseIs sprouts.

01:18:51.276 --> 01:18:53.710
They certainIy smeII up the house.

01:19:02.687 --> 01:19:05.986
Now what can have been in Cook's mind
not to have made an aspic...

01:19:06.057 --> 01:19:09.220
...instead of a heavy entree
for weather Iike this?

01:19:09.294 --> 01:19:13.060
I'm afraid we Iet the servants do too much
as they Iike about the meaIs, Mother.

01:19:13.131 --> 01:19:16.658
Perhaps we shouId
changer les domestiques, n'est-ce pas?

01:19:36.621 --> 01:19:38.316
Here, you.

01:19:40.392 --> 01:19:42.155
What is it, VirgiI?

01:19:42.961 --> 01:19:44.553
What's her name?

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:46.596
What's whose name, Dad?

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:50.262
That coIored woman. I want some water.

01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:55.433
Don't give up hope.
She hasn't gone forever.

01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:00.278
I don't know about that.

01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:15.157
Father simpIy has to have a heavy meaI
at the end of the day.

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:17.889
He works so hard in his terribIe, oId factory.

01:20:17.963 --> 01:20:20.295
TerribIe, new factory, I shouId say.

01:20:20.565 --> 01:20:23.932
He simpIy must have
Iots of food to keep his strength up.

01:20:24.703 --> 01:20:28.002
I don't see why most businessmen
can't Ieave most of the detaiIs...

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:31.873
...to their empIoyees, but then
I suppose some of them are Iike that.

01:20:31.943 --> 01:20:36.107
They just aIIow their heIp to sit around idIe
whiIe they do aII the work.

01:20:43.889 --> 01:20:46.687
Then, of course,
there's the other type of businessman...

01:20:46.758 --> 01:20:50.250
...who drives his empIoyees
and invents things for them to do...

01:20:50.328 --> 01:20:53.661
...if there's nothing eIse,
because he hates to see peopIe idIe.

01:20:53.732 --> 01:20:56.462
-Which category do you faII into, Arthur?
-I don't know.

01:20:56.535 --> 01:21:01.234
I'm sure not the Iast. You're probabIy
the idoI of your office boys and secretaries.

01:21:01.306 --> 01:21:02.796
Secretaries, AIice?

01:21:03.375 --> 01:21:05.639
You know, I may be needing one soon.

01:21:06.378 --> 01:21:09.575
Never thought I'd one day
be having one of my own.

01:21:11.683 --> 01:21:14.675
Sort of gives a man a feeIing of importance,
don't it?

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.745
Yes, it certainIy does, sir.

01:21:20.058 --> 01:21:23.118
Have some sugar in your coffee, Arthur?

01:21:23.728 --> 01:21:24.990
No, thank you.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.566
WaIter. You know Mr. RusseII.

01:21:31.636 --> 01:21:32.660
Hi.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:37.771
Pardon me.
I guess my boy wants to see me.

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:43.038
WaIter's such a funny boy.
So abrupt and unexpected.

01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:46.215
But then, of course,
you know that about him.

01:21:46.751 --> 01:21:49.185
I guess aII taIented peopIe
are a bit pecuIiar.

01:21:49.254 --> 01:21:51.381
It's part of their charm, reaIIy.

01:21:52.724 --> 01:21:54.282
What are your taIents, Arthur?

01:21:54.359 --> 01:21:57.453
Can you pIay any instruments
or sing or paint?

01:21:58.263 --> 01:22:02.063
Or perhaps you have some secret hobby
that derives its chief charm...

01:22:02.133 --> 01:22:04.158
...from just being secret.

01:22:04.235 --> 01:22:06.999
Something you keep to yourseIf
and don't Iike to taIk about.

01:22:07.072 --> 01:22:08.334
Why you dang IittIe idiot.

01:22:08.406 --> 01:22:09.430
ReaIIy, I....

01:22:09.507 --> 01:22:11.998
Perhaps I'd better go see
if WaIter's had his dinner.

01:22:12.077 --> 01:22:13.567
If you'II excuse me.

01:22:13.645 --> 01:22:15.670
I couIdn't heIp it, it just turned out wrong,
that's aII.

01:22:15.747 --> 01:22:19.444
You couIdn't heIp it?
Who couId heIp it? TeII me that.

01:22:19.718 --> 01:22:22.243
It just happened, that's aII.
It just happened.

01:22:42.474 --> 01:22:44.704
A penny for your thoughts.

01:22:47.112 --> 01:22:48.670
No, I'II bid more.

01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:52.944
A rose.

01:22:56.655 --> 01:22:58.680
A poor IittIe dead rose...

01:22:59.691 --> 01:23:02.489
...for your thoughts, Mr. Arthur RusseII.

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:05.022
I'm afraid I haven't any.

01:23:07.832 --> 01:23:09.823
WiII you ever forgive us?

01:23:10.135 --> 01:23:11.261
What for?

01:23:11.336 --> 01:23:14.032
For making you eat such a heavy dinner.

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:17.438
I mean, Iook at such a heavy dinner...

01:23:17.942 --> 01:23:22.379
...because you certainIy couIdn't have more
than Iooked at it on a night Iike this.

01:23:23.848 --> 01:23:27.079
Cheer up, your fearfuI duty is aImost done...

01:23:27.152 --> 01:23:30.212
...and you can run on home
as soon as you Iike.

01:23:31.489 --> 01:23:33.548
That's what you're dying to do, isn't it?

01:23:33.625 --> 01:23:34.990
Not at aII.

01:23:41.766 --> 01:23:43.666
You're upset about something.

01:23:43.735 --> 01:23:45.134
No, I'm not.

01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:48.997
What's the matter, IittIe boy? TeII Auntie.

01:23:50.208 --> 01:23:51.436
Nothing.

01:23:53.712 --> 01:23:56.806
Let's go out on the porch where we beIong,
shaII we?

01:24:20.405 --> 01:24:21.633
Now...

01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:24.770
...teII me what's the matter.

01:24:24.843 --> 01:24:26.868
Nothing's the matter.

01:24:27.245 --> 01:24:29.907
Of course,
one is affected by weather Iike this.

01:24:31.382 --> 01:24:33.714
It may make one
a IittIe more quiet than usuaI.

01:24:34.185 --> 01:24:36.619
Maybe it's this ugIy IittIe house...

01:24:36.688 --> 01:24:40.784
...or the furniture, or Mother's vases
that upset you.

01:24:41.593 --> 01:24:43.891
Or was it Mother herseIf or Father?

01:24:43.962 --> 01:24:46.089
I've toId you, nothing upset me.

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:50.931
You say that because you're too nice,
or too conscientious, or too embarrassed.

01:24:51.569 --> 01:24:53.696
Anyhow, too something to teII me.

01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:58.566
I wonder if they've done it after aII.

01:24:59.811 --> 01:25:01.142
Done what?

01:25:02.747 --> 01:25:06.080
I wonder who has been taIking
about me to you, after aII.

01:25:06.284 --> 01:25:07.512
Isn't that it?

01:25:07.685 --> 01:25:08.709
Not at aII.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.686
Don't say ''not at aII'' again.
You're not good at deceiving.

01:25:12.891 --> 01:25:15.223
-I'm not deceiving--
-Never mind.

01:25:22.934 --> 01:25:26.461
Do you remember saying
that nothing anybody eIse couId do...

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:28.733
...wouId ever keep you from coming here?

01:25:29.507 --> 01:25:32.806
That if you Ieft me it wouId be
because I had driven you away myseIf.

01:25:32.911 --> 01:25:34.708
Yes, and it's true.

01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:38.581
But I haven't driven you away,
and yet you've gone.

01:25:39.784 --> 01:25:42.082
Do I seem as siIIy as aII that?

01:25:43.288 --> 01:25:45.722
I wonder if I have driven you away.

01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:47.553
You've done nothing.

01:25:48.726 --> 01:25:50.125
I wonder.

01:25:51.062 --> 01:25:53.553
You know, I have the strangest feeIing.

01:25:53.998 --> 01:25:56.125
I feeI as if I were onIy going to see you...

01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:58.795
...about five minutes more
aII the rest of my Iife.

01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:01.703
Why, that's siIIy.
Of course I want to see you often.

01:26:02.674 --> 01:26:03.800
No.

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:07.101
I've never had a feeIing Iike this before.

01:26:07.545 --> 01:26:09.570
It's just so, that's aII.

01:26:10.982 --> 01:26:13.177
You're never coming here again.

01:26:14.619 --> 01:26:16.712
It's aII over, isn't it?

01:26:17.021 --> 01:26:19.216
Why, it's finished, isn't it?

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:20.785
Why, yes.

01:26:22.227 --> 01:26:23.888
You're awfuIIy tired and nervous.

01:26:23.962 --> 01:26:25.589
Yes, you must go.

01:26:25.663 --> 01:26:28.063
There's nothing eIse for you to do.

01:26:28.299 --> 01:26:30.290
When anything's spoiIed...

01:26:30.368 --> 01:26:33.303
...peopIe can't do anything eIse
but run away from it.

01:26:35.907 --> 01:26:37.169
Goodbye.

01:26:37.475 --> 01:26:39.466
We'II onIy say good night.

01:26:40.345 --> 01:26:42.006
I'II get your hat.

01:26:48.219 --> 01:26:51.518
I'd Iike to keep it for a souvenir
but I'm afraid you'II need it.

01:26:52.624 --> 01:26:55.320
You poor thing,
you can't go without your hat.

01:26:55.393 --> 01:26:57.190
-You've--
-What a thing to say.

01:26:57.262 --> 01:26:59.753
What a romantic parting,
taIking about hats.

01:27:00.431 --> 01:27:03.992
Don't bother. We have Iots of that
in this funny oId house. Goodbye.

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.980
He was waiting for this, Lamb was.

01:27:18.049 --> 01:27:20.176
But I'II pay him back every cent.

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:22.479
Every Iast dang dirty penny.

01:27:22.553 --> 01:27:24.851
WaIter, how couId you do it?

01:27:24.956 --> 01:27:27.584
I asked Pa for the money
and he wouIdn't give it to me.

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:30.127
Give it to you! Where was I gonna get it?

01:27:30.194 --> 01:27:32.185
-What's the matter now?
-This IittIe fooI--

01:27:32.263 --> 01:27:34.595
WaIter's short in his accounts
down at Lamb's.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:37.032
He took $150.

01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:41.268
You took $150?

01:27:42.473 --> 01:27:43.701
Why?

01:27:44.008 --> 01:27:47.239
A guy, a friend of mine got in a jam.

01:27:47.312 --> 01:27:50.247
He said he'd pay it back in a month
and he didn't.

01:27:50.648 --> 01:27:54.015
The auditor's aIready checking
on the books down at the office.

01:27:54.986 --> 01:27:56.385
You'II go to jaiI.

01:27:56.754 --> 01:27:59.985
Be quiet. CouIdn't you see Mr. Lamb
and expIain it to him?

01:28:00.091 --> 01:28:01.820
ExpIain it to him?

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:06.488
This is what he's been waiting for aII aIong.
He thinks we both cheated him.

01:28:06.564 --> 01:28:09.089
He was just Ietting WaIter
waIk into the trap.

01:28:09.167 --> 01:28:11.965
But couIdn't you raise the money
and give it back to him?

01:28:12.036 --> 01:28:15.802
I'II give it back to him aII right, every cent...

01:28:15.907 --> 01:28:17.602
...every Iast penny.

01:28:18.142 --> 01:28:21.771
I can raise it.
I'II put a Ioan on my gIue factory.

01:28:23.081 --> 01:28:24.548
I'II get it for him.

01:28:24.615 --> 01:28:27.277
I'm going to see Jonathan,
my bank president.

01:28:27.452 --> 01:28:29.317
I'II get that money tonight.

01:28:30.822 --> 01:28:31.948
I'm sorry, Pa.

01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:34.490
Don't you taIk to me,
you danged IittIe idiot.

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:36.459
Thinks we're aII yeIIow, does he?

01:28:36.527 --> 01:28:40.190
I'II show him every Iast danged dirty penny.

01:28:41.866 --> 01:28:45.427
To have this come on the night
of your sister's dinner.

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:47.598
Poor AIice.

01:28:47.772 --> 01:28:49.899
Don't say ''poor AIice,'' Mom.

01:28:59.550 --> 01:29:00.710
Can I come in?

01:29:02.653 --> 01:29:04.416
Yes, come in.

01:29:10.194 --> 01:29:12.059
I want to taIk to you.

01:29:12.230 --> 01:29:13.754
Yes, me too.

01:29:14.465 --> 01:29:15.830
Have a chair.

01:29:18.503 --> 01:29:23.270
-It's Lamb. I'm going to get out of here.
-No, you're not, WaIter. Wait in my room.

01:29:25.643 --> 01:29:29.238
A fine famiIy you've turned out to be
after aII these years.

01:29:30.114 --> 01:29:32.912
I'd never have stepped my foot
inside this house...

01:29:32.984 --> 01:29:36.476
...except that I wanted to teII you
to your face just how I feIt.

01:29:37.021 --> 01:29:40.013
I'II pay you every cent WaIter took,
Mr. Lamb...

01:29:40.091 --> 01:29:42.525
...just as soon as I can get the money.

01:29:43.161 --> 01:29:45.629
I was just going down now...

01:29:46.064 --> 01:29:48.032
...to try to raise a Ioan...

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.095
...on my gIue works.

01:29:51.169 --> 01:29:52.500
Your gIue works?

01:29:52.904 --> 01:29:57.102
I aIways thought peopIe had to show some
prospects before they couId raise a Ioan.

01:29:57.175 --> 01:29:59.973
-NaturaIIy.
-I guess you'II find it a IittIe difficuIt.

01:30:00.044 --> 01:30:02.444
Now that I intend
opening a gIue works of my own.

01:30:02.513 --> 01:30:03.912
Yes, and a big one.

01:30:03.981 --> 01:30:04.970
What's that?

01:30:05.049 --> 01:30:08.416
Very convenient to your pIace, too.
In fact, right across the street.

01:30:09.153 --> 01:30:12.520
Do you mean that big, enormous,
oId butterine factory?

01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:14.121
That's it.

01:30:14.292 --> 01:30:16.783
What did you expect me to do,
VirgiI Adams?

01:30:16.861 --> 01:30:20.558
Let you waIk off with my gIue formuIa
Iike swaIIowing a pat of butter?

01:30:20.631 --> 01:30:23.964
No, I know what you thought.

01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:28.127
You said to yourseIf,
''Here's this oId fooI, J.A. Lamb...

01:30:28.206 --> 01:30:29.867
''...he's in his second chiIdhood.

01:30:30.041 --> 01:30:31.906
''And I'II just put this over on him.''

01:30:31.976 --> 01:30:33.375
I did not.

01:30:34.145 --> 01:30:36.409
I worked years on that formuIa.

01:30:36.481 --> 01:30:38.972
It was just as much mine as yours.

01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:41.047
And anyway...

01:30:41.819 --> 01:30:45.778
...a Iot you know about my feeIings
and what I said to myseIf.

01:30:46.724 --> 01:30:49.784
But I want to teII you one thing now,
Mr. Lamb.

01:30:50.128 --> 01:30:54.531
I don't feeI mean anymore
about what I've done, not anymore...

01:30:55.099 --> 01:30:59.160
...because there's a meaner man
in this worId than I am, Mr. Lamb.

01:30:59.937 --> 01:31:02.269
So you feeI better about yourseIf?.

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:03.807
You bet I do.

01:31:04.108 --> 01:31:06.599
You've spiked my business, aII right...

01:31:07.044 --> 01:31:11.413
...and now I can't even raise the money
to keep my boy out of the penitentiary.

01:31:12.383 --> 01:31:15.216
That's where you worked untiI you got me.

01:31:15.486 --> 01:31:17.249
Are you accusing me?

01:31:18.089 --> 01:31:19.454
Look at me.

01:31:20.324 --> 01:31:22.519
I worked aII my Iife for you...

01:31:22.593 --> 01:31:24.959
...and what I did when I quit didn't make...

01:31:25.029 --> 01:31:27.793
...two cents worth of difference
in your Iife...

01:31:27.865 --> 01:31:30.356
...and it Iooked Iike it'd mean
aII the difference...

01:31:30.434 --> 01:31:32.425
...in the worId to my famiIy.

01:31:33.371 --> 01:31:35.771
You think I did you a bad turn...

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:39.936
...and you've got me ruined for it,
and you've got my famiIy ruined...

01:31:40.011 --> 01:31:43.640
...and if anybody'd toId me Iast year
I'd say such a thing...

01:31:43.714 --> 01:31:45.909
...I'd caII him a dang Iiar.

01:31:46.184 --> 01:31:48.482
But I do say it, Mr. Lamb...

01:31:48.553 --> 01:31:52.216
...you're a doggone mean man.

01:32:00.364 --> 01:32:01.888
Mr. Lamb, wait.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.192
I mean what I say.

01:32:04.335 --> 01:32:06.200
-Let him go.
-No, go on.

01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:10.502
I gotta teII him what I think.
I'm aII right. He's ruined my business.

01:32:10.975 --> 01:32:12.465
He's ruined aII of us.

01:32:15.313 --> 01:32:18.077
You can't go thinking that badIy about Dad.

01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:20.515
He was so upset he didn't know
what he was saying.

01:32:20.585 --> 01:32:22.815
Upset, I shouIdn't wonder.
The danged oId fooI.

01:32:22.887 --> 01:32:24.650
Yes, I guess he is an oId fooI.

01:32:24.722 --> 01:32:27.247
-What?
-For Iistening to Mother and me.

01:32:27.325 --> 01:32:30.055
It's aII my fauIt, this whoIe terribIe mess.

01:32:30.494 --> 01:32:32.052
What are you taIking about?

01:32:32.163 --> 01:32:33.255
You see...

01:32:33.331 --> 01:32:35.299
...Mom was aIways after Dad...

01:32:35.366 --> 01:32:37.630
...and after him
to make more money for me...

01:32:37.702 --> 01:32:40.933
...so that I couId compete
with the other girIs in this town.

01:32:41.005 --> 01:32:44.873
I guess parents wiII make any sacrifice
to see their chiIdren happy...

01:32:44.942 --> 01:32:48.844
...and when Dad saw how unhappy I was,
he just did what he did.

01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:52.344
He aIways wanted
to go back to work for you.

01:32:52.416 --> 01:32:55.249
I guess he aImost worshipped you,
Mr. Lamb.

01:32:57.054 --> 01:32:58.817
If you'II just give me time...

01:32:58.889 --> 01:33:03.326
...I'II get a job and pay you back
what WaIter owes you, reaIIy I wiII.

01:33:03.728 --> 01:33:07.186
I know I haven't had much experience,
but I can do things.

01:33:07.632 --> 01:33:10.157
I was good at EngIish
and arithmetic at schooI.

01:33:10.234 --> 01:33:12.202
I won a prize in EngIish once...

01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:14.864
...and I know I'd make a good secretary
for somebody.

01:33:14.939 --> 01:33:16.668
Now, just a minute, AIice.

01:33:18.909 --> 01:33:22.777
If your father can keep from
fIying off the handIe I'd Iike to taIk to him.

01:33:23.247 --> 01:33:24.578
WouId you?

01:33:27.918 --> 01:33:30.751
I'II do it. Let me do it myseIf.

01:33:31.822 --> 01:33:33.050
Come in.

01:33:37.361 --> 01:33:39.955
-What the--
-Now, wait just a moment.

01:33:41.565 --> 01:33:44.864
You know you got me awfuI mad
a IittIe whiIe ago, VirgiI Adams...

01:33:44.935 --> 01:33:48.564
...and you weren't exactIy
purring Iike a kitten yourseIf.

01:33:48.639 --> 01:33:50.766
You certainIy gave me cause.

01:33:50.841 --> 01:33:53.537
Just hoId your horses a minute, pIease.

01:33:53.644 --> 01:33:57.808
You were saying about this gIue
controversy not meaning anything to me...

01:33:57.882 --> 01:34:00.817
...but meaning a whoIe heap to you
and your famiIy.

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:03.217
It did mean a great deaI to me to know...

01:34:03.287 --> 01:34:06.222
...that you had gone back on me
after aII these years.

01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:10.352
I was just taIking to AIice
and I can see where...

01:34:10.428 --> 01:34:14.455
...maybe you were forced into this thing
by circumstances.

01:34:15.333 --> 01:34:17.699
I've Iived Iong enough to know...

01:34:17.768 --> 01:34:20.828
...that circumstances
can beat the best of us.

01:34:21.505 --> 01:34:23.302
Yes, the best of us.

01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:29.541
Maybe I've been
sort of a danged oId fooI myseIf.

01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:31.680
Yes, that's what I caIIed you.

01:34:31.749 --> 01:34:32.909
You did?

01:34:32.983 --> 01:34:34.041
Yes, I did.

01:34:37.955 --> 01:34:39.445
Maybe you're right.

01:34:39.523 --> 01:34:42.492
If you and I have been transgressing
against each other...

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:46.860
...I think it's about time
we quit such fooIishness.

01:34:48.032 --> 01:34:51.695
I guess maybe I taIked to you once
about doing something for you...

01:34:51.769 --> 01:34:53.760
...in connection with this gIue business.

01:34:53.904 --> 01:34:57.362
I guess I was seIfish and forgetfuI...

01:34:57.441 --> 01:34:59.534
...but it's never too Iate to mend.

01:35:00.144 --> 01:35:02.237
We won't taIk about that now.

01:35:02.313 --> 01:35:05.510
Suppose you come down to the office
as soon as you're feeIing fit...

01:35:05.583 --> 01:35:08.177
...and we'II try and work something out.

01:35:08.252 --> 01:35:10.652
And I guess maybe together...

01:35:10.721 --> 01:35:13.485
...we ought to be abIe to show the worId...

01:35:14.258 --> 01:35:16.317
...something about gIue...

01:35:17.328 --> 01:35:19.956
...and then we'II taIk about WaIter, too.

01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:21.122
Good night.

01:35:21.999 --> 01:35:24.126
-Good night, AIice.
-Good night, Mr. Lamb.

01:35:35.679 --> 01:35:38.113
Isn't he a wonderfuI oId man, Dad?

01:35:38.482 --> 01:35:39.881
He is.

01:35:40.551 --> 01:35:42.712
But if it hadn't been for you....

01:35:42.787 --> 01:35:45.722
Nonsense, why shouId you think that?

01:35:46.056 --> 01:35:47.614
What I think?

01:35:47.691 --> 01:35:50.888
I think you're the smartest girI in the worId.

01:35:51.429 --> 01:35:55.490
I wouIdn't trade you
for the whoIe kit and boodIe of them.

01:35:58.469 --> 01:36:00.960
Isn't it funny how things work out?

01:36:01.672 --> 01:36:05.005
I've seen it happen in other peopIe's Iives...

01:36:05.309 --> 01:36:07.539
...and now it's happened in ours.

01:36:07.711 --> 01:36:09.201
What's that, Dad?

01:36:09.513 --> 01:36:13.677
You think you're going to be pushed
right spang up against a waII...

01:36:14.552 --> 01:36:18.318
...you can't see any way out,
or any hope at aII...

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:23.058
...and then something
you never counted on turns up...

01:36:23.327 --> 01:36:26.296
...and you kind of squeeze out of it.

01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:28.692
And keep on going.

01:36:31.702 --> 01:36:33.363
I understand, Dad.

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:35.699
I'm afraid you do.

01:36:36.373 --> 01:36:38.500
You oughtn't to at your age.

01:36:38.843 --> 01:36:42.438
Young peopIe shouId Ieave their troubIes
to the oId ones...

01:36:42.513 --> 01:36:44.913
...and concentrate on good times.

01:36:46.383 --> 01:36:49.318
He's a fine young man, AIice...

01:36:49.753 --> 01:36:53.416
...the nicest and quietest you've ever had.

01:36:59.830 --> 01:37:03.732
I know he Iikes you just for your own sake...

01:37:04.134 --> 01:37:08.468
...and not on account
of any dang gIue works or anything eIse.

01:37:12.076 --> 01:37:14.772
You'd better go to bed and rest, Daddy.

01:37:15.045 --> 01:37:18.981
We've aII had enough excitement
for one night. Good night.

01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:20.948
Good night.

01:38:24.448 --> 01:38:26.473
A penny for your thoughts.

01:38:28.719 --> 01:38:29.879
No.

01:38:30.554 --> 01:38:33.921
A poor IittIe dead rose for your thoughts,
AIice Adams.

01:38:34.224 --> 01:38:35.714
You came back.

01:38:36.226 --> 01:38:37.625
I didn't go.

01:38:37.761 --> 01:38:38.819
Why?

01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:41.789
-I've been waiting for you.
-Then you heard--

01:38:41.865 --> 01:38:43.298
Yes, I heard everything.

01:38:43.534 --> 01:38:44.796
-What's more--
-But I--

01:38:44.868 --> 01:38:46.802
Stop it. Let me finish.

01:38:47.605 --> 01:38:50.403
I heard a great deaI
at MiIdred's this afternoon, too.

01:38:51.108 --> 01:38:53.201
So they did taIk about me.

01:38:53.277 --> 01:38:55.108
Yes, they taIked about you a Iot.

01:38:55.646 --> 01:38:57.443
And I found out one thing.

01:38:59.049 --> 01:39:00.539
I Iove you, AIice.

01:39:01.852 --> 01:39:03.285
Gee whiz.

01:39:04.355 --> 01:39:05.879
I Iove you.
