WEBVTT

00:04.134 --> 00:05.744
<i>Previously on</i> SEAL Team...

00:05.788 --> 00:07.920
Memory aid supplements?
You're taking these?

00:07.964 --> 00:09.792
Supposed to make you sharp.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.489
<i>Telling the team
about my PTS last month--</i>

00:11.533 --> 00:13.274
didn't realize how good
it would make me feel.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.711
- Spoke your truth. <i>
Chemo? How bad is it?</i>

00:15.754 --> 00:17.321
I don't need anything
from you, Clay.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.367
Especially sympathy.
It turns my stomach.

00:19.410 --> 00:22.413
Three tourist destinations
in West Africa were hit

00:22.457 --> 00:25.025
by simultaneous
suicide bomb attacks.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.461
The group claiming
responsibility is

00:26.504 --> 00:28.376
the Sahaba of Greater Sahel.

00:28.419 --> 00:31.988
There are murmurs among command
about Ray's last deployment.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.991
"Dangerously erratic behavior"
was the phrase I heard.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.949
- Command knows.
- My PTS?

00:36.993 --> 00:38.647
Someone talked.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.257
Carl Dryden,
Agency Chief of Station.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.607
We've confirmed the location
of Saidou Boukare's

00:42.651 --> 00:44.783
safe house
in the market district of Kaya.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.698
<i>All stations, be advised,</i>

00:46.742 --> 00:49.179
<i>-I pass Albatross.
- Stand down.</i>

00:49.223 --> 00:50.876
- This is crap, man.
- Take it easy, all right?

00:50.920 --> 00:52.400
There's got to be a reason
why they canked the op.

00:52.443 --> 00:54.228
At 0700 hours, all three HVTs
will be meeting

00:54.271 --> 00:57.274
at an SGS airfield
15 klicks South of Kaya

00:57.318 --> 00:59.015
to get on a small plane
out of the country.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.109
<i>Got a match?
- All we're missing is Boukare.</i>

01:06.153 --> 01:08.677
- Saidou Boukare
is not on target.
- He's at a safe house.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.766
<i>Chatter on SGS channels suggests
this commuter train</i>

01:10.809 --> 01:12.942
<i>-is the group's next target.
That is the same train</i>

01:12.985 --> 01:14.683
that we believe
Boukare is boarding.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.554
- Ray, that's Mandy.
- In SGS custody.

01:16.598 --> 01:19.775
- We got to do something.
- Right now we got a train
to catch.

01:58.901 --> 02:02.122
Final checks.
Three mikes out.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.871
Three minutes!

02:14.134 --> 02:17.224
Third time we've had Boukare
in our crosshairs.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.704
Third time's a charm.

02:19.748 --> 02:22.925
Train interdiction is
as ninja as it gets.

02:42.771 --> 02:46.905
Hey! Nothing we can do for
Mandy until we secure the train!

02:46.949 --> 02:48.733
Front-sight focus, Jace.

03:02.530 --> 03:05.881
Lieutenant Davis, we have no
additional intel at this time.

03:05.924 --> 03:08.188
Copy. If the analysts uncover
anything pertaining

03:08.231 --> 03:10.451
to the train attack, you bring
it to me front and center.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.366
This is a fluid operation.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.891
My team won't make it
to the train.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.327
Bravo's on their own.

03:17.371 --> 03:19.199
As if this op
wasn't challenging enough.

03:19.242 --> 03:22.027
Listen up!
This is a time-sensitive target.

03:22.071 --> 03:25.161
Saidou Boukare and an
unknown number of SGS fighters

03:25.205 --> 03:26.467
are gonna be
on that commuter train

03:26.510 --> 03:28.033
heading to downtown Ouagadougou.

03:28.077 --> 03:30.035
- Lieutenant Davis?
- Intel is still coming in

03:30.079 --> 03:31.733
from the previous op,
but we believe

03:31.776 --> 03:33.125
there is a suicide bomber
on board,

03:33.169 --> 03:34.649
who intends to detonate

03:34.692 --> 03:36.999
when the train travels
below the U.S. consulate.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.740
Thousands of lives are at stake.

03:38.783 --> 03:41.960
Bravo Team must board, clear,
and disable the SGS bomber

03:42.004 --> 03:44.006
before the train passes
under its target.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.008
You are good. Okay, let's go!

04:09.074 --> 04:11.076
Why don't we stop the train
out here

04:11.120 --> 04:13.165
a couple miles
from the consulate?

04:13.209 --> 04:15.167
Bomber feels something's off,

04:15.211 --> 04:17.169
he'll clack off
and kill hundreds.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.259
Next stop, Boomtown.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.355
Havoc, this is 1. How far
till the train is on the X?

04:28.398 --> 04:31.227
Copy, 1. ETA 20 mikes.

04:36.145 --> 04:39.279
Well, we beat the clock before,
but never like this.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.283
Bravo, stand by.
We're 30 seconds out.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.195
All clear.

06:10.239 --> 06:11.675
Havoc, this is 1. I pass Salk.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.677
All right,
strip down to your civvies.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.244
We're rolling slick.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.724
Pistols only.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.247
We're looking for Boukare,

06:18.290 --> 06:21.076
any SGS fighters,
any S-vests on board.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.556
Leapfrog fashion,
slow and smooth.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.079
I know
this train's a powder keg,

06:24.122 --> 06:25.863
but we got to take Boukare
alive. You got it?

06:25.907 --> 06:27.561
What's in his head
could be useful.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.040
Roger that, boss.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.042
Clock's ticking.

06:31.086 --> 06:34.437
Copy. Bravo's prepping to enter
the first commuter carriage.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.178
What is this?

06:36.221 --> 06:37.875
Potentially a break.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.834
This confirmed, real-time feed?

06:39.877 --> 06:42.097
Yes, piping back to the servers
we've confiscated

06:42.140 --> 06:44.055
and on the dark web.

06:44.099 --> 06:46.493
One of the SGS fighters is
livestreaming from the train.

06:46.536 --> 06:50.453
Oh, become a trend terrorist,
broadcasting their martyrdom?

06:50.497 --> 06:52.673
Everybody wants
their 15 minutes of fame.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.110
Fortunately, they don't know
we're tapped into their feed.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.678
Wow. They're showing us
their playbook. This is huge.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.255
There! There's our HVT.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.258
Boukare.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.652
Okay, well, these three guys
flanking Boukare--

07:15.696 --> 07:17.654
they've got to be with him.

07:17.698 --> 07:20.962
Live-streamer makes
five SGS total.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.664
Blue beanie guy makes six.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.579
Heavy jacket this part
of the world?

07:29.623 --> 07:31.973
My money's on him
wearing an S-vest.

07:49.817 --> 07:52.167
Good eyes, Lieutenant.

07:52.210 --> 07:55.126
Pull the images of those SGS
fighters, get 'em over to Bravo.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.259
Yes, ma'am.

08:01.785 --> 08:05.746
All right, guys,
17 minutes on my mark.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.357
Ray, Clay, Sonny,
want you to enter first.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.534
- All right? Stay spread out. <i>
Bravo 1, passing sitrep.</i>

08:11.578 --> 08:14.668
<i>There's a live feed from
the forward most passenger car.</i>

08:14.711 --> 08:17.540
<i>We PID'd the HVT and an S-Vest.</i>

08:17.584 --> 08:20.500
<i>Count at least six SGS.
Images inbound.</i>

08:20.543 --> 08:22.458
Bravo 1 copies all.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.678
That's a hell of a lot of
firepower for that front car.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.723
All right, look, I'm gonna
call an audible. Sonny,

08:26.767 --> 08:28.508
MP7, kit up.

08:28.551 --> 08:31.336
But I want you to enter the lead
car heavy when the time comes.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.860
Crew that size, we're gonna need

08:32.903 --> 08:34.426
as much stopping power
as we can get.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.124
All right, Jace,
my kit is not exactly low-viz.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.299
How am I supposed to get
to the front car

08:37.342 --> 08:38.779
without being noticed?

08:38.822 --> 08:40.389
You're gonna climb external
to the first car.

08:40.432 --> 08:41.999
- All right, all right.
- You understand? Hey! Hey!

08:42.043 --> 08:44.001
Don't make entry till I call it.

08:44.045 --> 08:46.569
It seems typecasting to have
a Texan jumping car-to-car

08:46.613 --> 08:49.529
on a moving train there.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.095
Sure you don't want an extra gun
up there with Sonny?

08:51.139 --> 08:53.010
No, I want all eyes
clearing the passenger cars.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.621
There's no saying who's gonna be

08:54.664 --> 08:56.492
watching or recording
that live video stream,

08:56.536 --> 08:58.712
so we need to cover our faces
when we assault that lead car.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.017
Tell you what. We'll bandana
down when time comes.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.366
- Got it?
If anybody needs me,

09:01.410 --> 09:03.281
- I'll be on the roof.
- Copy that.

09:03.325 --> 09:05.632
Sonny?

09:05.675 --> 09:08.460
Let's go, boys. Yeehaw!

09:11.028 --> 09:12.813
- Jason?
- Yeah?

09:12.856 --> 09:16.251
Got less than 15 minutes,
hundreds of lives,

09:16.294 --> 09:17.948
including our own, on the line.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.907
I know Boukare's
our best lead to Mandy,

09:19.950 --> 09:21.691
but our heads have got
to be here.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.780
I'm solid, man. Let's move.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.164
Bravo 1, this is 3.

10:43.207 --> 10:46.123
Progress up top is going a
little slower than anticipated.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.215
Just get there.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.447
Hey.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.627
Rear two cars are clear.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.673
Maybe they packed
all their firepower up front.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.718
Yeah.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.596
<i>Bravo, be advised,
you're about to arrive</i>

11:24.640 --> 11:27.687
<i>at the last station
before the consulate.</i>

11:27.730 --> 11:31.038
Havoc, this is 1.
Cars one and two are clear.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.170
<i>Bravo, all eyes</i>

11:33.214 --> 11:36.304
<i>rake the window, starboard side.</i>

12:02.069 --> 12:03.635
Havoc, this is 1.
We got an additional

12:03.679 --> 12:05.899
- target on three. <i>
It's a good copy, 1.</i>

12:05.942 --> 12:08.292
Rolling bag makes one in here,

12:08.336 --> 12:10.338
plus six in the next carriage.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.644
Can't all go heavy
on the lead car now.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.348
Bravo 5, you've got a clean
line of sight.

12:20.391 --> 12:23.394
Hang back and cancel him
when we assault.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.267
5 copies all. Out.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.886
We're pulling into the station.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.638
Take Trent and sweep the cars,
make sure

12:49.681 --> 12:51.901
- no more Tangos have boarded.
- Copy.

12:59.691 --> 13:02.042
Should we, uh,
go into the next car,

13:02.085 --> 13:03.521
confirm there's only six enemy?

13:03.565 --> 13:05.828
There's no need. Davis has eyes.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.612
Once Clay and Trent
get back to us,

13:07.656 --> 13:11.268
if there's no more Tangos,
we'll make our move.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.836
Only nine minutes
until the consulate.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.925
Can't move
until Sonny's in position.

13:15.969 --> 13:19.233
Bravo 3, what's your status?

13:21.278 --> 13:24.586
Bravo 3 is pinned down
until we leave this station.

13:46.651 --> 13:48.392
No. No, no, no, no, no.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.660
1, this is 6.
All clear back here.

13:55.704 --> 13:58.489
That's a good copy.
Consolidate in car three.

14:02.711 --> 14:05.932
Bravo 1, this is Havoc. The HVT
is on the move with two Tangos.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.934
<i>We no longer have eyes on him.</i>

14:07.977 --> 14:10.632
<i>I say again, we have
lost visuals on the HVT.</i>

14:10.675 --> 14:12.808
<i>He may have exited the train.</i>

14:13.809 --> 14:16.072
We lose Boukare,
we lose our link to Mandy.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.691
Well, Bravo,
Mr. Boukare is ghosting.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.532
What's the call, Jace?

14:42.490 --> 14:45.145
Havoc, this is 1. I need
a head count in that lead car.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.764
- Ah.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.288
Oh. Oh. <i>Excusez-moi.
I'm so sorry. Sorry.</i>

14:58.332 --> 15:00.116
I'm so sorry.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.253
<i>Bravo 1,</i>

15:06.296 --> 15:09.647
three SGS are still on board,
including the blue beanie.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.912
Bravo 1, this is SABER actual.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.870
My team will handle the HVT.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.524
<i>You and Bravo Charlie Mike.</i>

15:16.567 --> 15:18.787
Negative, Havoc. It's my
tactical call. Bravo 1 out.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.314
Can't delay much longer
without drawing suspicion.

15:24.358 --> 15:28.188
Bravo 4, 6, you're on the HVT.
Coordinate with Havoc,

15:28.231 --> 15:30.973
<i>-hook up with G.B.
- Good copy, 1.</i>

15:31.017 --> 15:32.714
Bravo 6, do not lose that HVT.

15:42.463 --> 15:43.943
Running low on time.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.770
Bravo 3, give me your status.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.511
Moving.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.082
Sure cutting Clay and Trent
loose was wise,

15:53.126 --> 15:54.431
given our priorities?

15:54.475 --> 15:55.998
Look, Brock's got us covered
out here.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.957
Three of us against three
of them in that lead car?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.610
Easy day. Move.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.054
Okay. No, there. Stop. Pause it.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.012
What do you got?

16:10.056 --> 16:11.753
These roller bags?

16:11.796 --> 16:13.189
Boukare's men left them behind.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.017
Given the roller bag bomber

16:15.061 --> 16:18.455
in car three, these are likely
additional explosives.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.718
That's enough explosive to tear
down an entire city block.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.286
The blue beanie has the S-vest
to deal with.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.288
Same for the roller bag guy
in car three.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.769
So who is holding the trigger
for these bags?

16:27.812 --> 16:29.814
This is precisely why
it was wrong for Hayes

16:29.858 --> 16:31.512
to put his boys on Boukare.

16:33.427 --> 16:36.865
Bravo 1, hold fast.
There are likely additional

16:36.908 --> 16:38.649
<i>explosives on board.
We do not have an ID</i>

16:38.693 --> 16:40.521
<i>on the triggerman.</i>

16:40.564 --> 16:42.218
Fuck.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.396
We are on the X in five minutes.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.486
Havoc, nobody on their feed's
holding a detonator?

16:49.530 --> 16:52.359
Negative, Bravo 1.
Given the show blue beanie made

16:52.402 --> 16:53.838
for the camera,
I'm certain they would've

16:53.882 --> 16:55.579
flashed one if they had it.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.146
<i>Copy that.</i>

16:57.190 --> 16:59.105
Well, that just leaves
one more trigger guy

16:59.148 --> 17:00.497
we got to take out
on top of the others.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.543
Yeah, triggerman
who's a total ghost to us.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.675
We don't have time to search
the whole damn train again.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.155
No way Boukare would leave
the triggerman

17:06.199 --> 17:08.114
- that far from the bags.
- Yeah, that puts him

17:08.157 --> 17:10.507
in the lead car, but where?

17:10.551 --> 17:12.596
Easy.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.608
Jace, the car is packed.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.610
I cannot make out
anyone suspicious from here.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.743
We're gonna have to go in
and make him before we assault.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.136
- I'm gonna go in solo.
- No, no, no.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.920
What about the livestream?

17:31.963 --> 17:34.705
- No masks?
- No masks. Nah,
too many SGS in there.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.925
We go in there with masks,
they'll be spooked.

17:36.968 --> 17:39.580
<i>Bravo, be advised you're about
to enter the tunnel.</i>

17:39.623 --> 17:41.190
<i>Four minutes out from the X.</i>

18:04.735 --> 18:06.824
No time to waste.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.449
Bravo 3, this is 2.
How far out are you?

18:29.543 --> 18:31.501
Bravo 3, this is 2.
Say again your last.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.155
I have you broken
and unreadable.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.736
Ugh. Damn it.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.607
2, this is 3. How copy?

18:50.651 --> 18:52.957
Damn it!

18:53.001 --> 18:55.134
They can't hear me.

19:01.009 --> 19:05.840
Man upstairs seems hellbent
on me dying in a dark tube.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.942
Havoc, this is Bravo 6.
We keep heading west?

19:20.985 --> 19:23.640
<i>Bravo 6, Ground Branch reports
troops in contact</i>

19:23.684 --> 19:25.990
<i>and a man down.</i>

19:26.034 --> 19:27.296
- Yeah, copy all.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.921
- Good to go.
- Ready?

20:25.441 --> 20:27.400
<i>Havoc, this is Bravo 6.</i>

20:27.443 --> 20:29.228
<i>We're treating G.B.'s wounded.</i>

20:29.271 --> 20:32.187
<i>No longer in pursuit of HVT.</i>

20:37.192 --> 20:39.760
Ground Branch will catch up
to Boukare. We haven't lost him.

20:39.803 --> 20:42.545
Secondary triggerman's
on the right side. I got him.

20:42.589 --> 20:45.548
- Copy. And the other three?
- You and Sonny'll split 'em.

20:45.592 --> 20:48.029
The three are up front.
I'll help assist.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.161
- Sonny's unresponsive.
- What?

20:50.205 --> 20:51.467
He keys up,
but all I get back is static.

20:51.511 --> 20:54.035
- Shit.
- Without Sonny, that leaves,

20:54.078 --> 20:56.080
what, four of them
for the two of us?

20:56.124 --> 20:59.214
<i>All stations,
less than two minutes out.</i>

20:59.258 --> 21:01.216
Blue beanie's pretty deep, Jace.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.957
Not sure you and me
can get to him in time.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.091
We go in fast and divide 'em,
clean up the mess, got it?

21:07.135 --> 21:10.138
- Easy day, my ass.
- That's right.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.706
Bravo 3, this is 2.
If you can hear me,

21:12.749 --> 21:15.012
we have four in the lead car,
and we need you on this.

21:15.056 --> 21:19.016
- Yup. <i>
- Starboard side, Blue beanie
is our hot button to hit.</i>

21:19.060 --> 21:20.670
<i>Stand by.</i>

21:27.286 --> 21:30.027
<i>Bravo 1, you're on the X
in 60 seconds.</i>

21:30.071 --> 21:32.682
<i>You need to move now.</i>

21:32.726 --> 21:35.076
Check.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.041
Bravo 5, stand by,
shooters ready.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.652
Three, two, one. Execute.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.306
Oh!

22:11.068 --> 22:12.418
Why aren't we vapor yet?

22:12.461 --> 22:14.158
He's waiting for the consulate.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.769
I don't have a shot.

22:15.812 --> 22:18.467
<i>Bravo, 15 seconds remaining.</i>

22:24.865 --> 22:26.127
Clear!

22:30.914 --> 22:34.483
Helo lanyard for the win, baby!

22:34.527 --> 22:36.355
1, this is 5.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.878
Car three is all clear.

23:08.691 --> 23:11.128
Remember the new stop, now.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.392
Ah.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.394
Of all the ops we've run,

23:15.437 --> 23:18.788
I finally got to release
my inner Butch Cassidy.

23:18.832 --> 23:21.225
Didn't Butch blow the train up?

23:21.269 --> 23:23.053
And shouldn't you be Sundance,
Sonny?

23:23.097 --> 23:24.620
Ah, come on. Why the hell would
I want to be Sundance, okay?

23:24.664 --> 23:26.579
Butch is funny, charismatic,

23:26.622 --> 23:29.016
and untraditionally handsome,
like myself.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.018
I get more of a Hoss
from <i>Bonanza</i> vibe from you.

23:31.061 --> 23:33.716
Ah, eat a bag of dicks.
I am Butch.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.634
Yeah, buddy.

23:41.245 --> 23:42.986
Thought we were on that train

23:43.030 --> 23:44.858
bound for glory
for a second there, brother.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.121
About as close of a call
as we've had.

23:47.164 --> 23:49.776
Got the job done, Ray.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.212
Might not have needed
Sonny's buzzer-beater

23:51.255 --> 23:53.214
had we have had Trent and Clay.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.303
What's that supposed to mean?

23:55.346 --> 23:58.785
It means your mind being
on Mandy nearly got us killed.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.961
All right, you sent guns
we needed off the train

24:01.004 --> 24:02.528
because Boukare's the link
to her, right?

24:02.571 --> 24:03.964
Why is she even
in captivity, huh?

24:04.007 --> 24:05.661
She left the Agency.

24:07.010 --> 24:09.839
Look, man, I feel for her.

24:09.883 --> 24:12.494
That loss of control, freedom--

24:12.538 --> 24:15.192
it's soul-crushing.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.977
Yeah.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.632
At least when we went
after you, Ray, we had intel.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.938
With Mandy, we got nothing,
zero, zip.

24:21.982 --> 24:25.376
Jace, she's as strong
as they come, all right?

24:25.420 --> 24:26.943
She'll handle her business.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.597
What about that guy, huh?
What about Dryden?

24:28.641 --> 24:30.947
Is he doing anything about this?

24:30.991 --> 24:32.819
- He may not know.

24:32.862 --> 24:35.386
He's chief of station. Hyena
farts out here in the wind,

24:35.430 --> 24:37.519
he knows about it, all right?

24:37.563 --> 24:39.565
- Look, I need answers from him.
- Now, are you sure

24:39.608 --> 24:42.393
that's the right play?

24:42.437 --> 24:44.657
Those generators--
they're probably heading

24:44.700 --> 24:46.702
to that airfield
that we took earlier.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.530
Dryden--
he does not miss a step.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.490
Okay, he canked us off of
that safe house hit on Boukare

24:51.533 --> 24:53.100
so that he can get his hands
on that airfield.

24:53.143 --> 24:55.232
He is expanding his footprint.

24:55.276 --> 24:56.973
You saying you don't trust him?

24:57.017 --> 24:58.627
I'm saying, six months ago,
we deployed here off a boat.

24:58.671 --> 25:01.325
And now the war machine is
putting down roots.

25:01.369 --> 25:03.327
He's executing agendas that...

25:03.371 --> 25:06.417
they're just way above
our pay grade, man.

25:06.461 --> 25:09.420
I'm not letting Mandy rot.
She needs our help.

25:09.464 --> 25:10.987
And he may see her
as a distraction

25:11.031 --> 25:12.685
from the job
he wants us to do here.

25:12.728 --> 25:15.078
Now you go to him with nothing
but that damn photo,

25:15.122 --> 25:17.037
and he shuts you down, what help
are you gonna be to Mandy then?

25:24.348 --> 25:26.350
Okay.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.396
Hey. Hey.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.354
Nice work stopping the attack.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.574
- Sorry I missed all the fun.
- What you missed was Boukare.

25:32.618 --> 25:33.880
That's what you missed--
Boukare.

25:33.923 --> 25:35.316
Ground Branch guys
were in trouble.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.709
Now our HVT's in the wind.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.275
But G.B.'s still on his tail,
right?

25:38.319 --> 25:40.016
Saved thousands of lives today.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.496
Take the win.
Okay, that's really easy

25:41.540 --> 25:42.976
for you to just "take the win."

25:43.019 --> 25:45.152
We don't have Boukare,
there is no win to take.

25:45.195 --> 25:49.678
Half a second from getting Bravo
killed, and you come after me?

25:49.722 --> 25:51.941
Look, forgetting that probe
in North Korea,

25:51.985 --> 25:53.813
a bad judgment call today,

25:53.856 --> 25:55.292
something's got you
off your game, boss.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.772
You got something to say,
you fucking say it.

25:56.816 --> 25:59.209
You fucking say it now.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.342
Right.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.871
Your teammates
made the right call,

26:08.915 --> 26:10.917
helping my boys out of the fire.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.484
You know what?
We had this guy Boukare

26:13.528 --> 26:16.487
in our crosshairs three times,
and three times, we missed him.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.054
You should be more concerned

26:18.098 --> 26:20.187
about nearly handing SGS
their biggest victory yet.

26:20.230 --> 26:23.059
Pulling your men off target was
a near catastrophic error.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.583
I made the call. We handled it.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.715
You did,
by the seat of your pants.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.717
You committed
operational malpractice

26:28.761 --> 26:30.719
by not using all the firepower
in your arsenal

26:30.763 --> 26:32.852
- to get the job done.
-"Operational malpractice."

26:32.895 --> 26:34.636
That's what you're calling it.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.117
'Cause that is funny coming
from the guy who canked our op

26:37.160 --> 26:39.859
when we had him dead to rights.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.512
You've been around long enough

26:41.556 --> 26:43.776
to know that dirtbags
like Boukare grow on trees.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.213
Why are you so tight
in the shorts for him?

26:47.562 --> 26:49.477
Maybe 'cause of the fact

26:49.520 --> 26:53.873
that this dirtbag probably has
this former CIA agent hostage.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.440
That's why.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.660
- Where'd you get that?
- Pulled it off target
on the airfield.

26:58.704 --> 27:01.010
It's Mandy Ellis.
She's a former colleague.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.970
I see.

27:04.013 --> 27:07.060
So you nearly tanked the train
op over your friendship?

27:07.103 --> 27:08.452
Sir, what are you gonna do
about this?

27:08.496 --> 27:10.411
We need to make her a priority.

27:10.454 --> 27:13.240
Removing SSE off-site

27:13.283 --> 27:15.024
without submitting it
through the proper channels

27:15.068 --> 27:17.374
is a violation of the UCMJ.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.028
Are you even looking for her?

27:19.072 --> 27:20.421
- I can have you brought up
on charges.
- Oh.

27:20.464 --> 27:21.857
Charges of absconding
with evidence.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.424
Evidence that my people
could have used

27:23.467 --> 27:25.818
to help answer the questions
you're now asking.

27:27.994 --> 27:30.779
This is "need to know" only.
Way above your clearance level.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.741
Just get us the target package
on Boukare.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.136
Your personal connection
to Ms. Ellis

27:40.180 --> 27:44.010
has clearly impaired your
tactical judgment.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.968
Bravo's off the Boukare hunt.

28:07.642 --> 28:10.340
Hey, what the hell's
up Jason's ass?

28:10.384 --> 28:13.387
Eh, not a blown-up choo choo
thanks to me.

28:13.430 --> 28:17.391
He jumped down my throat for
losing Boukare. Makes no sense.

28:17.434 --> 28:21.177
Ooh, is the honeymoon
of Clayson over?

28:21.221 --> 28:23.658
Hell's that mean?

28:23.702 --> 28:26.792
You two are tighter
than a bucket of possums.

28:26.835 --> 28:29.577
Yet you can't meet your old
buddy Sonny for a beer.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.535
Look, I got new
responsibilities, man.

28:31.579 --> 28:32.711
Same as you.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.147
Not exactly the same.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.931
But I tell you what,
when we get back,

28:35.975 --> 28:39.979
you, me, Stella-- let's go
get some beers and get zapped.

28:40.022 --> 28:41.720
That way, you get to punch
the marriage clock,

28:41.763 --> 28:44.374
and, well, I get the help

28:44.418 --> 28:47.073
of your beautiful bride's
wingman skills.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.903
- Sure.
- Sweet. Let's do it.

28:50.946 --> 28:53.470
- Yeah, no, that sounds fun.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.301
Hey, uh...

28:58.345 --> 29:00.826
look, if Emmet came to you
needing something...

29:03.002 --> 29:06.179
...you think you could forget
all those years of hurt?

29:06.222 --> 29:07.789
Emmet's always been teats
on a bull for me,

29:07.833 --> 29:09.704
but now I'm supposed
to be there for him?

29:09.748 --> 29:13.186
But, you know, the more time
I spend with Leanne,

29:13.229 --> 29:17.451
the more I...
I see Emmet in myself.

29:17.494 --> 29:20.236
For better and for worse.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.890
Really?

29:21.934 --> 29:24.197
Yeah, it makes me feel bonded
to him more than ever.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.851
It's weird.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.940
Ugh. But you...

29:27.983 --> 29:29.637
you will understand one day

29:29.680 --> 29:31.204
when you become a daddy there,
Clay.

29:31.247 --> 29:35.121
Is, uh, something up with Ash?

29:35.164 --> 29:36.296
Cancer.

29:40.256 --> 29:43.912
Oh. Oh.
I'm sorry, man.

29:43.956 --> 29:46.610
T-That's, that's a tough go.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.743
What're you gonna do?

29:48.787 --> 29:51.311
I don't know.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.313
You know, he's only ever
really seemed interested

29:53.356 --> 29:56.664
in being a dad when he needs
something, you know?

29:56.707 --> 30:00.276
I got plenty on my plate
as it is with Stella.

30:00.320 --> 30:04.367
Mm, if Leanne ever
gave me the cold shoulder,

30:04.411 --> 30:07.022
it would truly break my heart.

30:07.066 --> 30:10.678
Yeah, well, you're a better
parent than Ash ever was.

30:10.721 --> 30:11.984
I'll figure it out.

30:12.027 --> 30:14.595
Do what you will,

30:14.638 --> 30:16.902
but having lost my mother,

30:16.945 --> 30:21.297
Clay, I would-- mm--

30:21.341 --> 30:24.866
I would do anything just
to get one more day with her.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.305
old Sonny Quinn
and the women he loves;

30:29.349 --> 30:33.483
never really gets to spend the
time that he wants with them.

30:33.527 --> 30:36.617
Thankfully you had enough time
on that train today, huh?

30:36.660 --> 30:40.099
Oh, hell yeah. It feels so good
to be chasing dirtbags again.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.492
You know? Rest of my life
just feels empty.

30:42.536 --> 30:47.497
But this war-- whoo,
it fills me up, buttercup.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.074
Oh.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.338
You feel Dryden out?

31:02.382 --> 31:04.427
He know anything about Mandy?

31:04.471 --> 31:05.994
I showed him the photo.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.692
- And?
- Hit a brick wall.

31:10.738 --> 31:15.569
That is what I was afraid of--
Mandy distracts from his agenda.

31:15.612 --> 31:18.006
What can I do to help?

31:18.050 --> 31:19.790
Nothing.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.842
Davis.

31:30.584 --> 31:33.108
- Hey.
- I gotta show you this.

31:33.152 --> 31:37.286
Oh, my God. Mandy.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.027
Yeah. Did you know?

31:39.071 --> 31:41.203
Of course not.
Where did you get this?

31:41.247 --> 31:44.424
Pulled it off target
at the airfield.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.774
She's in SGS captivity.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.909
Look, you know who that guy is?

31:50.952 --> 31:52.780
- You know where they could be?
- No.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.956
But now I know why you were so
hot to stay on Boukare's trail.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.219
- Does Dryden know about this?
- I don't know.

31:57.263 --> 31:58.917
I tried, I got nowhere with him.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.744
Nothing but stonewalled.
Listen,

32:00.788 --> 32:03.095
I need you to do some digging
quietly.

32:03.138 --> 32:06.881
Dryden pulled Bravo
off the Boukare hunt.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.491
Ground Branch has the lead now.

32:08.535 --> 32:10.537
Well, Ground Branch is gonna
be looking for payback

32:10.580 --> 32:13.366
after Boukare's men beat them
down the past two ops.

32:13.409 --> 32:14.976
If they take Boukare out,

32:15.020 --> 32:17.805
the trail to Mandy
will die with him.

32:29.425 --> 32:30.992
Was Davis able to help
with Mandy?

32:31.036 --> 32:32.515
I got nowhere, okay?

32:32.559 --> 32:35.214
Mandy's in danger
and nobody gives a shit.

32:35.257 --> 32:37.607
Look, we get a whiff of Boukare,

32:37.651 --> 32:39.218
we'll be back in the hunt
for her.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.089
No. You know what?
Dryden pulled us off Boukare.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.004
We're done.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.528
I told you, I warned you
he can't be trusted.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.356
Spare me with
the "I told you so," Ray.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.663
It's bad enough I gotta worry
about one of our teammates

32:49.706 --> 32:51.839
shivving me to command
over my issues in Nigeria,

32:51.882 --> 32:53.319
but now we're out of sync, too.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.190
What the hell are you
talking about here?

32:55.234 --> 32:56.670
You're tuning me out
for Clay's input,

32:56.713 --> 32:58.454
you're ignoring my advice
on how to handle Dryden,

32:58.498 --> 33:00.282
and now you're seeking out
Davis to help you

33:00.326 --> 33:02.023
when nobody's had your back
more than I have?

33:02.067 --> 33:03.590
Mandy's ass is in jackpot
and you're

33:03.633 --> 33:05.157
more concerned about
your role with Bravo Team?

33:05.200 --> 33:06.636
My role in Bravo Team
used to be keeping you

33:06.680 --> 33:08.029
from following your
worst damn instincts.

33:08.073 --> 33:11.250
By ignoring me and going
on full tilt,

33:11.293 --> 33:13.252
you've jeopardized the mission
and the chance we had

33:13.295 --> 33:14.470
of saving our friend.

33:15.689 --> 33:18.822
- You can shut me out
all you want, brother,

33:18.866 --> 33:21.434
but you need to
read the team in on Mandy.

33:21.477 --> 33:24.132
If memory serves,
Bravo runs best

33:24.176 --> 33:26.526
when all our cards are
on the table.

33:29.181 --> 33:31.009
You're right.

33:32.053 --> 33:34.969
Mandy walked away
from this hell.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.537
How'd she get tangled up
in this?

33:37.580 --> 33:40.322
I would've stayed on
Boukare's tail

33:40.366 --> 33:41.715
had I known that he was
our link to her.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.717
No, you made the only call
there was.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.502
So does this mean Mandy's
back in the Agency?

33:46.546 --> 33:49.984
No idea. Dryden locked up on me.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.074
Wonder what could have
lured her back?

33:53.118 --> 33:55.076
When was the last time you
talked to her, Jace?

33:55.120 --> 33:57.644
She came and saw me before
my trial. You know?

33:57.687 --> 34:02.214
Seemed happy in her new life.
Just doesn't add up.

34:02.257 --> 34:05.130
Maybe she never left the Agency.

34:05.173 --> 34:08.176
Yeah. Remember that one time
we showed up for work

34:08.220 --> 34:09.221
and Mandy wasn't there?

34:11.875 --> 34:13.877
You know how these spooks are.

34:13.921 --> 34:16.619
Maybe it's just a setup
for a new cover.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.534
Yeah, based on what we're
seeing from Dryden,

34:18.578 --> 34:21.537
you don't got to convince me
Agency folks are that slippery.

34:21.581 --> 34:24.018
I was there when Mandy
decided to quit.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.063
It was her choice.

34:25.106 --> 34:26.586
Mandy's a professional liar.

34:26.629 --> 34:28.370
One of the best we've
ever worked with.

34:28.414 --> 34:32.244
She's capable of anything,
including gaslighting you, Jace.

34:32.287 --> 34:36.422
You know, maybe she's not
who we thought she was.

34:55.354 --> 35:00.272
Hey. The team, they have
a possible location on Boukare.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.926
Get a target package together.

35:47.362 --> 35:48.624
Hey.

35:48.668 --> 35:51.061
What's up?

35:51.105 --> 35:53.716
- What?
- I snuck on to Dryden's laptop,

35:53.760 --> 35:55.327
looked into Mandy's files.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.546
- And?
- They're redacted.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.983
Redacted?
What-what does that mean?

36:00.027 --> 36:02.334
Well, it means we have no way
of knowing if she's here

36:02.377 --> 36:03.857
under official cover,
working off the books,

36:03.900 --> 36:05.293
or working on her own
as a civilian.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.382
- So we're nowhere.
- Well, with her.

36:07.426 --> 36:09.515
But I was able to identify
the man in this photo.

36:09.558 --> 36:13.388
He's a powerful warlord,
Aziz Sankara.

36:13.432 --> 36:16.086
His compound was overrun
by SGS two weeks ago.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.740
Okay, so maybe Mandy
was with him then?

36:17.784 --> 36:20.308
I wish I knew. Without being
able to access her file,

36:20.352 --> 36:22.267
I have no way of making
a connection between them.

36:22.310 --> 36:23.964
Anybody here have any intel

36:24.007 --> 36:26.184
- on where this guy's being held?
- Boukare knows.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.794
And Ground Branch has
a location on him.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.187
They're jocking up now.

36:29.230 --> 36:32.015
You want answers,
you got to be on this op.

36:32.059 --> 36:35.105
Got it. Thank you.

36:35.149 --> 36:37.760
- Dismissed.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.501
I hear you have
a target package on Boukare.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.068
I ordered you to stand down,
Hayes.

36:41.111 --> 36:42.243
Stay out of my team's way.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.071
Let Bravo back your men up here.

36:44.114 --> 36:46.247
So your bad judgment
can derail the op? Pass.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.075
Just like you passed
on Mandy Ellis?

36:48.118 --> 36:49.685
I mean, if she
is working for you,

36:49.729 --> 36:50.991
why aren't you doing anything
about it?

36:51.034 --> 36:52.427
I told you,
that was "need to know."

36:52.471 --> 36:54.516
A disavowed agent
is not your concern.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.519
As chief of station,
it should be yours.

36:57.563 --> 37:01.131
Former Agent Ellis is
not the mission here.

37:01.175 --> 37:02.568
Okay, look, I get
as master of the universe

37:02.611 --> 37:03.917
you're playing
global chess here,

37:03.960 --> 37:05.745
but do not hang her out to dry.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.486
I can have Bravo
on a flight out today

37:07.529 --> 37:09.270
if you're not happy with how
I'm running things.

37:09.314 --> 37:10.793
All right, look, you know what?
Boukare's cell has been

37:10.837 --> 37:12.795
eating your team's lunch
ever since we got here.

37:12.839 --> 37:15.189
At the airfield,
earlier at the ambush.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.712
You've missed out on him
three times.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.627
It would be
operational malpractice

37:18.671 --> 37:21.761
if you didn't use all
the firepower in your arsenal.

37:27.245 --> 37:32.032
Okay. Tell your men
to jock up. Now.

37:39.909 --> 37:42.172
Bravo, you're heading out to
support Ground Branch

37:42.216 --> 37:45.219
on this kill-capture.
The target is Boukare.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.656
Ground Branch was able
to track him to this building

37:47.700 --> 37:48.875
in a district downtown.

37:48.918 --> 37:51.356
How many fighters
he holed up with?

37:51.399 --> 37:53.053
Unknown. But my men are
in position,

37:53.096 --> 37:55.229
and waiting for you--
maximize firepower on target.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.318
You will engage
simultaneously to

37:57.362 --> 37:58.928
limit the time Boukare
has to squirt.

37:58.972 --> 38:00.887
Little birds are
the fastest way to insert.

38:00.930 --> 38:02.845
We land on the roof, work our
way down while G.B. works up.

38:02.889 --> 38:06.109
Helicopters are not an option--
SGS has enough

38:06.153 --> 38:08.373
firepower in this area to defend
against an air assault.

38:08.416 --> 38:11.289
Indig vehicles allow us
to pull right up to the front.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.943
Speed and surprise--
that's our ally.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.336
The area you're going to,
up-armored vehicles

38:15.380 --> 38:16.468
are a priority.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.644
You'll take our trucks.

38:18.687 --> 38:21.124
A strap from our team
will be going out with you.

38:21.168 --> 38:24.214
Since when does Bravo
need a babysitter?

38:24.258 --> 38:28.306
Remington knows the district.
He'll drive the lead vehicle.

38:28.349 --> 38:31.178
All right, so, we pull up,
grab Boukare and RTB.

38:31.221 --> 38:34.790
We're back quicker than
a prairie fire with a tailwind.

38:34.834 --> 38:38.490
ROE's the same? Shoot when
shot at or imminent threat?

38:38.533 --> 38:41.362
The district, waiting to be shot
at ain't gonna be a problem.

38:41.406 --> 38:45.061
Just get Boukare.
Dead or alive.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.331
We need to get to Boukare
before Ground Branch does,

38:53.374 --> 38:55.985
ensure this is a capture
and not a kill op.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.119
Hey, J.
- Yeah?

39:00.381 --> 39:01.382
What's this?

39:01.426 --> 39:03.036
Works like a Stingray.

39:03.079 --> 39:04.733
Just turn it on when you
get around enough of these guys

39:04.777 --> 39:06.256
on target;
I'll be able to pull

39:06.300 --> 39:08.737
data and locations off of
their cell phones.

39:08.781 --> 39:12.741
Maybe find any sort of lead
to Mandy.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.917
- Thanks.
- And...

39:14.961 --> 39:17.442
if Mandy is with Sankara,
this will come in handy

39:17.485 --> 39:20.401
if Boukare's memory
needs jogging, so...

39:20.445 --> 39:23.012
- go find our girl.
- Will do.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.760
"Disavowed."
What does an agent have to do

39:31.804 --> 39:33.327
for something like that?

39:33.371 --> 39:35.111
It's not always something
they've done.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.766
Think about how many times we've
been tasked outside the wire.

39:37.810 --> 39:39.899
Your trial's a good example
of that.

39:44.512 --> 39:47.776
You think she went rogue
or flipped?

39:47.820 --> 39:50.910
-"Rogue"?

39:50.953 --> 39:53.695
You've watched
too many bad movies.

39:53.739 --> 39:55.262
All I'm saying is

39:55.305 --> 39:57.307
we never leave
another frog behind.

39:57.351 --> 39:59.397
So why ain't that
the same with the Agency

39:59.440 --> 40:01.268
unless she's up to
something sketchy?

40:08.406 --> 40:10.016
What's with all the AK fire?

40:10.059 --> 40:13.933
SGS lookouts. Use the bursts
as warning signals.

40:13.976 --> 40:17.545
And people say texting's
impersonal.

40:17.589 --> 40:19.852
Means they know we're here.

40:49.925 --> 40:51.492
<i>All stations, I pass Sputnik.</i>

40:51.536 --> 40:53.842
<i>I say again, I pass Sputnik.</i>

40:55.496 --> 40:57.629
<i>Good copy.</i>

40:57.672 --> 40:59.544
That's probably not good.

40:59.587 --> 41:03.635
- What?
- The gunfire went dead.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.639
Bravo, stand by.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.728
<i>Dismount on my mark.</i>

41:13.688 --> 41:15.342
Oh, shit.
