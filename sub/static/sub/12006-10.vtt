<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"... </i>

00:02.485 --> 00:03.552
I do have feelings for Campbell...

00:03.586 --> 00:05.620
- Hey.
- ... But I have them for you too.

00:05.655 --> 00:07.222
<i>Wes: I wanted to introduce to you</i>

00:07.256 --> 00:08.323
<i>someone special from my team.</i>

00:08.357 --> 00:10.258
Give her a hand. East Riverside's own...

00:10.293 --> 00:11.426
<i>Regina Vasquez.</i>

00:11.461 --> 00:13.428
He needs a latina on his side.

00:13.463 --> 00:15.564
He's using you for the color of your skin.

00:15.598 --> 00:18.233
- What fraternity is Tank in again?
- Omega Psi!

00:18.267 --> 00:20.535
One of them invited me to
that luau they're having.

00:20.570 --> 00:22.270
- It's a dogfight.
- A what?

00:22.305 --> 00:24.573
If the brothers find out I told
you, I'm gonna be blackballed.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.308
One of these days, all these
girls are gonna get together,

00:26.342 --> 00:28.310
and pull a dogfight on you guys.

00:28.344 --> 00:30.512
Not cool, bro. Not cool.

00:30.546 --> 00:33.315
We all remember what it
was like to be so sure

00:33.349 --> 00:35.317
<i>that the way we felt would never change.</i>

00:35.351 --> 00:38.386
We're gonna be helping
communities in Peru for six months.

00:38.421 --> 00:39.654
Nikki told Jennice that she's been asked

00:39.689 --> 00:41.323
to extend her stay.

00:41.357 --> 00:42.524
Well, she didn't tell me that.

00:42.558 --> 00:44.526
I think you need to talk to your wife.

00:51.601 --> 00:53.301
Uh, hey.

00:53.336 --> 00:55.470
Don't freak out or anything,

00:55.505 --> 00:58.473
but, uh... Matthew is back.

00:59.274 --> 01:01.410

01:01.413 --> 01:04.212
Well, is that gonna be
weird, having him around?

01:05.113 --> 01:07.528
_

01:08.284 --> 01:10.252
Oh, he's coming. He's coming over here.

_

01:25.976 --> 01:26.780
_

01:30.506 --> 01:32.641
Well, I give him credit for that.

01:36.546 --> 01:38.413
(Phone clicks)

01:40.416 --> 01:42.284
Wow, that is gorgeous.

01:42.318 --> 01:43.585
You keep getting better and better.

01:43.586 --> 01:45.879

01:50.320 --> 01:52.673

- _
- No,

02:05.564 --> 02:07.542
that's a great idea.

02:09.645 --> 02:12.347
In fact, I know the perfect place to do it.

02:12.381 --> 02:14.683
Uh, this guy Logan runs it.

02:14.684 --> 02:18.175
_

02:18.354 --> 02:19.654
Why?

02:19.655 --> 02:26.418
_

02:26.419 --> 02:30.920
_

02:31.400 --> 02:32.634
Just send it to me.

02:32.668 --> 02:35.337
Yeah, I can take it. I have
some stuff to pick up anyway.

02:35.338 --> 02:37.630
_

02:37.673 --> 02:40.475
Emmett, we're friends.

02:41.577 --> 02:43.545
I don't mind doing it.

02:43.579 --> 02:45.280
You're gonna love it.

02:45.314 --> 02:46.681
So will she.

02:46.716 --> 02:49.284
- (Horn honks)
- _

02:49.318 --> 02:50.652
Uh, I'm gonna go catch up with Daphne,

02:50.686 --> 02:52.554
so I will see you in class.

02:54.590 --> 02:55.557
<i>Hey!</i>

02:55.591 --> 02:58.693
What is up, Lady Mustangs?!

02:58.728 --> 03:01.329
You guys ready for the big Buckner game?

03:01.364 --> 03:03.265
We were just saying
that you would think that

03:03.299 --> 03:04.599
it's like the state championship.

03:04.634 --> 03:06.201
Your brother's been running us so hard,

03:06.235 --> 03:07.435
you're lucky you can't play.

03:07.470 --> 03:09.437
Normally, I would agree with that,

03:09.472 --> 03:12.507
but this is a game I
actually wish I could play in.

03:12.541 --> 03:14.409
I hate Buckner.

03:14.443 --> 03:16.611
- They're really good.
- They've been playing for years.

03:16.646 --> 03:18.613
We just learned the game two months ago.

03:18.648 --> 03:20.682
<i>(Students clamoring)</i>

03:20.716 --> 03:23.285
What's going on up there?

03:23.319 --> 03:24.519

03:24.553 --> 03:25.520
Ugh!

03:44.473 --> 03:46.374
No no, I totally agree.

03:46.409 --> 03:47.676
Yeah, that's unacceptable.

03:47.710 --> 03:48.710
<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

03:48.744 --> 03:50.612
Uh. Well, yeah. I'll talk to the coach

03:50.646 --> 03:52.614
and, uh, I'll get back with you.

03:52.648 --> 03:54.449
Okay. Thanks, Principal Rose.

We have got to get them back,

04:13.703 --> 04:16.338
It's my last week of community service.

04:16.372 --> 04:17.672
I'm not gonna get in trouble.

04:17.707 --> 04:19.240
We already missed our first game

04:19.274 --> 04:20.375
when we got busted for fighting.

04:20.409 --> 04:22.277
They are calling us garbage!

04:22.311 --> 04:24.212
Okay, let's see what they
say when we're on the field.

04:24.246 --> 04:26.214
- I'm not missing that game.
- Me either.

04:26.248 --> 04:27.282
(Scoffs)

04:27.316 --> 04:29.217
Well, I've got nothing to lose.

<i>Nikki: Gosh, this is so crazy.</i>

04:31.520 --> 04:34.622
Yesterday I woke up in Peru,

04:34.657 --> 04:36.224
and now I'm here.

04:36.258 --> 04:37.325
Well, welcome back.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.593

your husband.

04:47.269 --> 04:49.504
I can't believe I'm saying this,

04:49.538 --> 04:50.572
but I have to go to work.

04:50.606 --> 04:53.341
No, I told you I've only got two days.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.542
I know. (Sighs)

04:54.577 --> 04:57.245
But I have to at least show face.

04:57.279 --> 04:58.646
I've got these two new guys I'm training,

04:58.681 --> 05:01.516
and I've got all this field hockey drama

05:01.550 --> 05:02.584
I've gotta deal with.

05:02.618 --> 05:05.186
(Sighs)

05:05.221 --> 05:06.654
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:06.689 --> 05:09.357
I will hurry back. Just
give me a few hours, okay?

05:09.392 --> 05:10.525
Okay.

05:10.559 --> 05:11.593
And no leaving this bed...

05:11.627 --> 05:12.594
(Giggles)

05:12.628 --> 05:13.661
except for supplies.

05:13.696 --> 05:15.497
Okay.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.401
Mmm. (Grunts)

05:19.435 --> 05:20.602
Mm mm mm mm mmm!

05:23.406 --> 05:25.306
<i>(Door closes)</i>

05:28.377 --> 05:29.577
You wanted to see me?

05:29.612 --> 05:32.313
I'm still working on the
options for the travertine.

05:34.350 --> 05:36.451
You want me to wash your car?

05:36.485 --> 05:37.585
Your car.

05:37.620 --> 05:40.422
Um, I just got it washed.

05:40.456 --> 05:42.357
No, I mean it's your new ride out front,

05:42.391 --> 05:44.392
a bonus for what you've done
on the East Riverside project.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.629
Oh... uh...

05:47.663 --> 05:49.631
It's still getting off the ground.

05:49.698 --> 05:51.533
I haven't decorated a single wall.

05:51.567 --> 05:53.501
Well, you've brought other value.

05:53.581 --> 05:55.415
This is nice, but...

05:55.449 --> 05:57.317
It's not a gift... you've earned it.

05:57.351 --> 05:58.585
Besides, I can't have you pulling up

05:58.619 --> 06:01.488
to those job sites in that beater of yours.

06:01.522 --> 06:03.223
You represent me.

06:03.290 --> 06:05.225
So this is for you?

06:05.259 --> 06:08.361
If that gets you to
"thank you" faster, sure.

06:08.395 --> 06:10.530
- I didn't mean to sound ungrateful...
- Good.

06:10.564 --> 06:12.699
Next, I need you to take this offer

06:12.733 --> 06:14.334
to the owner of that taco place

06:14.368 --> 06:15.535
in the East Riverside strip mall.

06:15.569 --> 06:17.537
Oh, Chuy's too?

06:17.571 --> 06:18.705
I love that place.

06:18.739 --> 06:20.340
The sooner we buy him out and the others,

06:20.374 --> 06:22.442
the sooner we can start
demo and start building.

06:22.476 --> 06:24.677
Don't you have somebody
else who normally does this?

06:24.712 --> 06:26.546
They don't speak Spanish.

06:26.580 --> 06:29.415
Well, I speak Spanish, but I don't
negotiate real estate deals...

06:29.450 --> 06:30.583
in English either.

06:30.618 --> 06:31.584
You're not negotiating.

06:31.619 --> 06:33.253
You're just a friendly face

06:33.287 --> 06:35.288
delivering the news in a
language they can understand.

06:35.322 --> 06:36.689
Well, what if they have questions?

06:36.724 --> 06:38.324
Then they talk to their attorney

06:38.359 --> 06:39.492
or their accountant or their mother.

06:39.527 --> 06:41.461
The bottom line is we're offering 10%

06:41.495 --> 06:43.463
above the appraised value.

06:43.497 --> 06:44.697
It would have been market value,

06:44.732 --> 06:46.699
but your mother started to rattle the cage,

06:46.734 --> 06:48.434
so we had to add the 10%.

06:48.469 --> 06:50.403
I have Carolyn on line two.

06:50.437 --> 06:52.438
Anyways, they would be
crazy not to take it.

06:52.473 --> 06:53.473
And the clock is ticking,

06:53.507 --> 06:54.741
so you should probably go down there

06:54.775 --> 06:56.409
before you take your
new car for a joy ride.

07:02.650 --> 07:04.350
I'm not looking to point fingers here.

07:04.385 --> 07:06.686
What we both want for
tomorrow is a fair game.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.488
I've seen your team stats.

07:08.522 --> 07:10.456
You guys are a Sunday practice for us.

07:10.491 --> 07:11.658
I even called off the scout.

07:11.692 --> 07:14.661
Wait. Colleges have
scouts for field hockey?

07:14.695 --> 07:16.663
I got a girl with a full ride to Wheaton.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.264
Another at Tufts.

07:18.299 --> 07:21.334
Working on getting my
goalie and forward set up.

07:21.368 --> 07:23.303
Let's just make an agreement.

07:23.337 --> 07:25.305
Carlton won't retaliate.

07:25.339 --> 07:26.339
No more pranks.

07:26.373 --> 07:28.207
Deal?

07:28.242 --> 07:29.542
Thanks.

07:36.183 --> 07:38.384
(Jorge sighing) Okay.

07:38.419 --> 07:40.219
- Hey, here.
- Oh, thanks.

07:40.254 --> 07:42.555
Hey, somebody named Terry came by...

07:42.590 --> 07:44.490
(Slightly groaning) and
dropped this off for you.

07:44.525 --> 07:46.359
Oh, that's my buddy.

07:46.393 --> 07:47.594
I've been waiting for this.

07:47.628 --> 07:49.195
What is that?

07:49.229 --> 07:50.530
It's rock climbing equipment.

07:50.564 --> 07:52.532
Oh, I've always wanted to try that.

07:52.566 --> 07:53.566
Where do you go?

07:53.601 --> 07:55.168
East Boulder.

07:55.202 --> 07:57.270
It's a rock climbing gym in Overland Park.

07:57.304 --> 07:59.472
- They have an 80-foot wall.
- Cool.

07:59.506 --> 08:01.341
You wanna come with me this weekend?

08:01.375 --> 08:05.478
Not a date, no pressure. Just as friends.

08:05.512 --> 08:07.447
Uh, sure.

08:07.481 --> 08:09.248
Awesome! I'm in.

08:09.283 --> 08:11.117
Where are we going?

08:11.151 --> 08:13.453
We're, uh... we're going rock climbing.

08:13.487 --> 08:16.289
Oh. Got it.

08:16.323 --> 08:18.124
We were just talking about it.

08:18.158 --> 08:19.325
Yeah, it's...

08:19.360 --> 08:21.260
You should totally go. I...

08:21.295 --> 08:23.363
I used to.

08:42.182 --> 08:43.249
What's up, Coach?

08:43.283 --> 08:45.318
So, when we were studying

08:45.352 --> 08:47.320
and I brought up college,
what did you mean by,

08:47.354 --> 08:48.388
"that's not gonna happen"?

08:48.422 --> 08:50.256
I meant I'm not gonna leave my mom

08:50.290 --> 08:52.458
and I'm not trying to go 50k
in debt by the time I'm 21.

08:52.493 --> 08:55.495
What if you could get a
scholarship for field hockey?

08:55.529 --> 08:57.497
They have those?

08:57.531 --> 09:00.299
(Scoffs) They have scholarships
for kids who speak Klingon,

09:00.334 --> 09:02.301
- so yeah, they do.
- How do I get one?

09:02.336 --> 09:05.304
I'm gonna make some calls, see
about getting a scout down here

09:05.339 --> 09:07.206
to check you out tomorrow.

09:07.241 --> 09:09.175
You just play your ass off and we'll see.

09:09.209 --> 09:10.476
Hmm.

09:10.511 --> 09:11.477
What about my mom?

09:11.512 --> 09:14.414
Good question, um...

09:14.448 --> 09:16.282
let's just take one step at a time.

09:16.316 --> 09:18.317
Let's get you that scholarship.

Mo' mass, mo' speed, mo' "mentum"!

09:27.461 --> 09:29.195
Greetings.

09:29.229 --> 09:31.464
Hi.

09:31.498 --> 09:34.300
You haven't called security on me,

09:34.334 --> 09:37.236
so I'm assuming that you haven't heard back

09:37.271 --> 09:40.239
from the fraternity
supreme court or whatever.

09:40.274 --> 09:41.474
Still waiting.

09:43.510 --> 09:45.378
Look, I'm sorry about that.

09:45.412 --> 09:46.612
Sometimes my mouth just does things

09:46.647 --> 09:49.148
that my brain can't control.

09:49.183 --> 09:51.484
I didn't mean to get you in trouble.

09:52.653 --> 09:54.253
I know.

09:54.288 --> 09:55.621
Look, my future's up in the air too.

09:55.656 --> 09:58.458
Who knows if my hand's gonna be okay.

09:58.492 --> 10:01.461
I think that we could
both use a distraction.

10:01.495 --> 10:03.362
Like what?

10:03.397 --> 10:04.530
Well,

10:04.565 --> 10:06.399
my field hockey team...

10:06.433 --> 10:08.568
they are playing my old high school...

10:08.602 --> 10:10.470
(Chuckles) who I hate.

10:10.504 --> 10:12.205
This morning,

10:12.239 --> 10:14.207
they pranked us by dumping garbage

10:14.241 --> 10:16.409
all over our front steps.

10:16.443 --> 10:18.211
There was a goat involved.

10:18.245 --> 10:20.446
- A real goat?
- Mm-hmm.

10:20.481 --> 10:22.615
So I wanna prank them back,

10:22.649 --> 10:24.617
except I don't know how.

10:24.651 --> 10:27.253
And plus, with this thing...

10:27.287 --> 10:29.655
Something tells me you're
the man for the job.

10:31.558 --> 10:34.293
I've been known to play
a few tricks on the enemy.

10:34.328 --> 10:37.463
- So you're up for it?
- To retaliate, escalate.

10:37.498 --> 10:39.365
Do you know where we can get a donkey?

10:39.399 --> 10:41.634
- No animals.
- Come on, no animals?

10:41.668 --> 10:43.603
(Deeply sighs)

10:47.641 --> 10:50.276
Okay, I'm in.

10:50.310 --> 10:51.544
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

10:57.182 --> 10:59.049
Hi, honey.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.051
What are you working on?

11:01.085 --> 11:02.719
Nothing.

11:02.754 --> 11:06.156
I barely see you kids
writing anything for school

11:06.191 --> 11:07.925
on real paper.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.126
Is it a personal project?

11:11.129 --> 11:12.095
It's stupid.

11:13.164 --> 11:15.732
I have these two great guys

11:15.767 --> 11:17.834
who are both interested in me,

11:17.869 --> 11:20.003
and I can't decide which
one I wanna be with,

11:20.038 --> 11:23.774
so... I'm maybe making a list.

11:23.808 --> 11:27.110
I would do the exact same thing.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.780
Come on. Let's hear it.

11:29.814 --> 11:30.814
Come on.

11:30.848 --> 11:32.149
Okay, uh...

11:32.183 --> 11:34.885
Jorge is a great listener.

11:34.919 --> 11:38.055
Campbell is funny and
unpredictable and brave.

11:38.089 --> 11:42.059
- Jorge has an amazing smile.
- (Chuckles)

11:42.093 --> 11:44.828
Campbell has these eyes

11:44.862 --> 11:46.997
that completely just...

11:47.031 --> 11:49.032
melt me from the inside, out.

11:49.067 --> 11:51.201
- Jorge has...
- Wait wait wait wait wait.

11:51.236 --> 11:53.837
Eyes that completely melt you?

11:53.871 --> 11:54.972
(Sighs)

11:55.006 --> 11:56.907
Sounds like your mind is made up.

11:56.941 --> 11:58.141
Campbell for the win.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.910
Really?

11:59.944 --> 12:01.712
Why isn't it obvious to me?

12:01.746 --> 12:03.947
(Sighs)

12:03.982 --> 12:05.882
Is it because he's in a wheelchair?

12:05.917 --> 12:08.051
No, of course not.

12:08.086 --> 12:10.887
Honey...

12:10.922 --> 12:13.757
It's okay to be nervous about something

12:13.791 --> 12:15.759
because it's unfamiliar.

12:15.793 --> 12:18.962
That doesn't make you a bad person.

12:18.997 --> 12:21.965
That's really not it.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.868
I'm gonna see what he's doing tonight.

12:31.776 --> 12:32.998
(Chuy speaking Spanish)

12:32.999 --> 12:37.340
_

12:37.782 --> 12:38.915
I know.

12:38.950 --> 12:42.085
(Speaking Spanish)

12:43.540 --> 12:46.108
_

12:46.109 --> 12:48.431
_

12:49.332 --> 12:53.103
_

12:54.950 --> 12:57.329
_

12:59.080 --> 13:00.764
_

13:02.805 --> 13:05.830
_

13:06.478 --> 13:08.011
He hates the taco business.

13:08.880 --> 13:14.095
_

13:20.870 --> 13:22.207
_

13:22.808 --> 13:24.385
_

13:31.603 --> 13:33.604
You think it's a good deal?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.772
I do.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.945
Coach Bridges?

13:41.979 --> 13:44.014
Hey, it's Toby Kennish from Carlton High.

13:44.048 --> 13:45.816
Not sure if you got my messages,

13:45.850 --> 13:49.986
but I wanted to formally
invite you to our game tomorrow.

13:50.021 --> 13:51.221
No no, not Buckner.

13:51.255 --> 13:53.123
There's a player on my team that

13:53.157 --> 13:54.891
you definitely need to check out.

13:56.928 --> 13:59.696
I see.

13:59.731 --> 14:01.932
Oh, that's too bad.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.101
Yeah, 'cause we've got a
scout coming all the way

14:04.135 --> 14:06.103
from North Carolina to check her out.

14:07.872 --> 14:09.072
Yeah, Duke.

14:09.107 --> 14:11.808
Now they beat you guys
4-2 last year, right?

14:13.010 --> 14:14.878
(Chuckles)

14:14.912 --> 14:16.046
Well.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.116
Hey, honey, I'm home!

14:19.150 --> 14:21.051
Whoa.

14:21.085 --> 14:23.019
Hi, mister.

14:23.054 --> 14:24.855
(Chuckles)

14:24.889 --> 14:26.723
Missus.

14:26.758 --> 14:27.891
How was your day?

14:30.128 --> 14:33.130
(Deeply sighs)

14:33.200 --> 14:35.868
You know, when I first got this place...

14:35.903 --> 14:38.905
I used to come in, close the doors,

14:38.939 --> 14:40.840
stand here and just be like,

14:40.874 --> 14:42.842
- "this place is all mine."
- Hmm.

14:42.876 --> 14:44.844
But it didn't feel right,

14:44.878 --> 14:47.046
so I used to pretend
that you were here, too.

14:47.080 --> 14:50.116
And what would I be doing?

14:50.150 --> 14:53.052
Sitting on the couch reading,

14:53.086 --> 14:54.253
getting home right after me,

14:54.288 --> 14:55.855
shaking out your umbrella.

14:55.889 --> 14:56.856
(Laughs)

14:56.890 --> 14:59.158
Anything that...

14:59.193 --> 15:00.726
made you here.

15:00.761 --> 15:02.929
Mm.

15:02.963 --> 15:04.931
Now this is amazing.

15:04.965 --> 15:05.932
Oh, yeah.

15:05.966 --> 15:07.099
So, uh, what's for dinner?

15:07.134 --> 15:09.869
Don't get too excited,

15:09.903 --> 15:12.839
because it is just a frozen lasagna.

15:12.873 --> 15:15.107
<i>But I did</i>

15:15.142 --> 15:17.109
pre-heat the oven

15:17.144 --> 15:20.012
and I made a salad.

15:20.047 --> 15:21.814
(Sniffs)

15:21.849 --> 15:23.182
- (Laughs)
- It's just what I want.

15:23.217 --> 15:25.117
Good.

15:25.152 --> 15:26.853
So, you hungry?

15:28.222 --> 15:29.188
Yeah.

15:29.223 --> 15:31.757
But first things first...

15:31.792 --> 15:33.159
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

15:35.229 --> 15:37.797
(Both chuckle)

15:37.831 --> 15:39.799
So, do you think the
Bulls could go all the way

15:39.833 --> 15:40.967
without Derrick Rose?

15:41.001 --> 15:43.836
Uh, I think they're
doing pretty good so far.

15:43.871 --> 15:45.104
At least they're just
playing the Knicks tonight.

15:45.138 --> 15:46.839
Ha, yeah, they suck.

15:46.874 --> 15:48.808
(Both laugh)

15:50.911 --> 15:52.178
<i>(Campbell softly groans)</i>

15:52.212 --> 15:55.948
That is not gonna happen.

15:55.983 --> 15:57.216
Can I help?

15:57.251 --> 15:59.018
It's okay.

15:59.052 --> 16:02.955
I'm sure there's something around here.

16:02.990 --> 16:04.056
I could do it.

16:06.894 --> 16:08.027
You can try.

16:15.035 --> 16:17.003
- Ooh! Uh. (Exhales)
- Ooh, here.

16:17.037 --> 16:19.005
(Daphne groans)

16:19.039 --> 16:21.874
(Groans loudly, chuckles)

16:21.909 --> 16:22.975
Um, I...

16:23.010 --> 16:25.211
(exhales) I can't do it.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.780
I'm sorry.

16:27.814 --> 16:29.181
I used to babysit. That's
how I get the strollers

16:29.216 --> 16:30.182
over the curb.

16:30.217 --> 16:32.051
Ouch.

16:32.085 --> 16:33.819
Oh, no! I didn't mean that you...

16:33.854 --> 16:35.087
It's okay.

16:35.122 --> 16:37.089
<i>Let's just go.</i>

16:40.027 --> 16:42.128
(Whispering) Looks like the coast is clear.

16:44.197 --> 16:45.865
- See that statue?
- Affirmative.

16:45.899 --> 16:48.200
That is our guy... Cornelius Buckner.

16:48.235 --> 16:50.069
Cornelius? That's a dumb name.

16:50.103 --> 16:53.172
Uh-huh. He founded this
as an all-boys school,

16:53.206 --> 16:55.174
even though he has three daughters.

16:55.208 --> 16:58.878
It's not too late to bleach that
giant penis onto that perfect lawn.

16:58.912 --> 17:00.880
(Laughs) You are so gonna get us busted!

17:00.914 --> 17:01.948
Shh!

17:01.982 --> 17:03.049
You're gonna get us busted.

17:03.083 --> 17:04.951
There's security everywhere.

17:04.984 --> 17:08.020
Okay, now work fast, keep
your head on a swivel.

17:08.055 --> 17:09.855
I love it when you talk G.I. Joe.

17:12.858 --> 17:17.128
<i>(Bar patrons chattering, cheering loudly)</i>

17:17.164 --> 17:18.196
Sorry, we're at capacity.

17:18.231 --> 17:19.992
What?

17:20.007 --> 17:21.973
It's a big game tonight. We're full.

17:28.849 --> 17:30.750
I thought you said you were full.

17:30.784 --> 17:31.984
They were in here earlier.

17:32.019 --> 17:34.687
Dude, come on, we know
what's going on here.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.088
No, what's going on
here is I'm at capacity.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.690
You can keep him out

17:37.724 --> 17:38.858
just 'cause he's in a wheelchair.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.760
Is that what I said? I didn't say that.

17:40.794 --> 17:42.995
What you're doing is illegal.
You know that, right?!

17:43.030 --> 17:44.897
We could file a massive
lawsuit against you and...

17:44.932 --> 17:46.766
Daphne, stop!

17:46.800 --> 17:48.768
We can go somewhere else.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.742
I don't understand why we had to leave.

17:56.777 --> 17:57.810
What do you want me to do?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.779
Deck him, call the cops, something!

17:59.813 --> 18:01.080
I don't care that much.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.848
How can you not care?

18:02.883 --> 18:04.050
That guy's a douchebag.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.685
You can't let him get away with that.

18:05.719 --> 18:07.920
Yelling at him isn't gonna change a thing.

18:07.955 --> 18:10.723
Oh, so you'll just let
him walk all over you?

18:14.895 --> 18:16.862
Maybe we should do this another time.

18:26.006 --> 18:30.009
So, I'm gonna get a scout to the
game tomorrow to check out Sharee.

18:30.043 --> 18:31.944
Oh, that's awesome.

18:31.979 --> 18:34.180
She has so much raw talent.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.082
I just really want her to
get the chance she deserves.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.817
- You know?
- Yeah.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.051
Yeah, I do.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.855
It's just like what
I've been doing in Peru.

18:42.890 --> 18:46.893
It feels really good to
help people get that chance.

18:46.927 --> 18:50.163
You could take what you've been doing...

18:50.197 --> 18:51.831
and make it bigger.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.034
In Peru.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.837
I just...

18:57.871 --> 18:59.772
I know.

18:59.807 --> 19:01.941
I really like what I'm doing at Carlton.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.010
I know.

19:13.053 --> 19:15.121
What's this about?

19:16.957 --> 19:19.992
The church I'm working for,

19:20.027 --> 19:22.161
they've offered me a job in Africa.

19:28.101 --> 19:30.069
(Sighs)

19:31.839 --> 19:32.972
For how long?

19:33.006 --> 19:35.041
I don't know.

19:36.944 --> 19:40.079
I thought that this trip
would be a one-time...

19:40.113 --> 19:43.182
I mean, I didn't know going into it that...

19:43.217 --> 19:45.818
Didn't know what?

19:49.923 --> 19:53.826
I think that this work is
what I'm supposed to be doing.

19:56.997 --> 20:00.900
I, um... I haven't made any decisions yet,

20:00.934 --> 20:03.903
or anything. I'm just, uh...

20:03.937 --> 20:05.872
just floating it.

20:08.075 --> 20:09.108
Okay.

20:14.147 --> 20:17.116
You know I'm not just saying
this 'cause you made it,

20:17.150 --> 20:19.886
but... best salad I've ever had.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.888
(Laughs)

20:32.065 --> 20:33.900
That glue is fantastic.

20:33.934 --> 20:35.167
Wheat paste.

20:35.202 --> 20:37.103
Won't harm the statue, but once it dries,

20:37.137 --> 20:39.105
it's gonna be really hard to get off.

20:39.139 --> 20:40.873
How do you like this makeup?

20:40.908 --> 20:42.875
Uh...

20:44.878 --> 20:47.046
he's supposed to look like a
badass Carlton field hockey player,

20:47.080 --> 20:48.214
<i>not a clown.</i>

20:48.248 --> 20:49.882
How about a badass drag queen?

20:49.917 --> 20:52.051
That's an insult to drag queens everywhere.

20:52.085 --> 20:55.121
Cornelius Buckner is not
cool enough to be one of them.

20:55.155 --> 20:56.856
Hey, you have any toilet paper in that bag?

20:56.890 --> 20:58.157
Oh, you're not gonna squat
behind a bush, are you?

20:58.191 --> 21:00.726
No, I'm gonna glue the
paper to Cornelius' butt,

21:00.761 --> 21:01.827
and have it look like it's
coming out of his skirt.

21:01.862 --> 21:03.930
What does that have to
do with field hockey?

21:03.964 --> 21:06.198
- Nothing, it's my signature.
- Ugh!

21:06.233 --> 21:09.201
Oh, come on, bathroom humor's
always a home run with the ladies.

21:09.236 --> 21:12.204
I wish I could see their faces
when they see this tomorrow.

21:12.239 --> 21:13.973
<i>- (Chuckles)
- (Radio chatter)</i>

21:14.007 --> 21:15.074
Oh, security security.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.175
- What? Where?
- We gotta go, we gotta go.

21:16.209 --> 21:17.843
- We gotta go!
- I have to get the paint.

21:17.878 --> 21:19.011
- Just leave it, let's go.
- (Ladder clatters)

21:19.046 --> 21:20.046
- Aah!
- Are you okay?

21:20.080 --> 21:21.914
- Just go go go go!
- Guard: Hey!

21:21.949 --> 21:23.916
<i>(Vehicle approaches)</i>

21:29.823 --> 21:31.123
Wow.

21:31.158 --> 21:32.124
What do you think?

21:32.159 --> 21:34.160
It's beautiful.

21:34.194 --> 21:36.128
I thought someone got
lost in the neighborhood

21:36.163 --> 21:37.863
and was using our driveway to turn around.

21:37.898 --> 21:40.032
It's, uh, a bonus from Wes.

21:40.067 --> 21:41.200
A bonus?

21:41.234 --> 21:43.035
Business must be booming.

21:43.070 --> 21:46.038
It is. I'm working harder
than I ever have in my life.

21:46.073 --> 21:47.206
Then you deserve it.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.075
- I do, right?
- Yes.

21:49.109 --> 21:50.242
I mean, at first I thought...

21:50.277 --> 21:52.111
(Sighs) "This is not me."

21:52.145 --> 21:53.946
I mean, look at this thing.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.948
But then I got in,

21:55.983 --> 21:58.718
- and I didn't wanna get out.
- (Laughs)

21:58.752 --> 22:00.786
Is this a new bag too?

22:00.821 --> 22:03.723
Yeah, my old one looked so...

22:03.757 --> 22:05.124
old on the seat.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.059
I love it.

22:07.094 --> 22:08.127
Am I crazy? I could just take it back.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.795
Don't you dare.

22:09.830 --> 22:11.931
What good is working hard
if you can't enjoy it?

22:11.965 --> 22:14.000
(Sighs) Thank you.

22:15.135 --> 22:16.936
You wanna go for a ride?

22:18.839 --> 22:20.806
- Yeah.
- (Laughing) Let's go.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.144
Well, now we both have bum hands.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.979
- (Both chuckle)
- Does it hurt?

22:27.014 --> 22:28.814
Nah, I play football.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.049
I've taken knees to the man-zone.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.884
I'm assuming that means "yes."

22:31.918 --> 22:33.886
(Laughs) Well, it was worth it.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.788
This, not the groin injury.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.757
Well, actually, both.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.759
We were state champs that year.

22:43.864 --> 22:45.164
A kiss to make it better.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.982
Okay, hold on.

23:03.016 --> 23:04.984
(Both chuckle)

23:15.929 --> 23:18.097
Mm. Okay okay. Okay, wait.

23:18.131 --> 23:20.066
You okay?

23:20.100 --> 23:23.903
Yeah, I... I... I just, uh...

23:23.937 --> 23:25.071
What's wrong?

23:26.973 --> 23:30.109
I don't know if I want to.

23:30.143 --> 23:32.111
(Exhales) Why, did I do something?

23:32.145 --> 23:35.047
Oh, no. No no no.

23:35.082 --> 23:38.017
Well, here. I'll light some
candles, put on a little music...

23:38.051 --> 23:40.119
No no no. That's... that's not it.

23:41.955 --> 23:42.988
Are you a virgin?

23:43.023 --> 23:45.758
No. Why does that have to be the reason?

23:45.792 --> 23:48.828
I just... I don't want to.

23:48.862 --> 23:49.995
(Exhales)

23:51.865 --> 23:52.998
Okay, that's cool.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.904
Really? 'Cause you don't seem cool.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.006
Well, I'm just confused.

24:01.041 --> 24:03.142
What's confusing?

24:03.176 --> 24:05.945
We're dating, and I like you.

24:05.979 --> 24:09.014
So that automatically means
we should be having sex?

24:09.049 --> 24:10.116
No! God.

24:10.150 --> 24:11.917
You're acting like I'm some sex machine.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.853
- No, I'm not!
- Things were fine...

24:13.887 --> 24:15.254
- A sex machine?
- ... And you suddenly pull back like I'm on fire.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.923
- What does that even mean?
- I thought it was something I did.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.091
(Sighs)

24:24.865 --> 24:26.832
Maybe I should go.

24:26.867 --> 24:27.933
Yeah.

24:27.968 --> 24:29.168
Maybe you should.

24:34.141 --> 24:36.942
<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

24:39.826 --> 24:40.859

24:40.894 --> 24:42.027
Come in!

24:44.931 --> 24:47.733
Hey, nice car. Is that yours?

24:47.767 --> 24:49.168
Yeah.

24:49.202 --> 24:50.736
What brings you over here?

24:50.770 --> 24:53.005
Uh, I was... I was looking for Daphne.

24:53.039 --> 24:55.741
- What's up?
- Nothing.

24:55.775 --> 24:57.676
Just... it's girl stuff.

24:57.711 --> 24:59.678
What's on your mind?

25:03.817 --> 25:05.985
Remember how Ty was my first?

25:06.019 --> 25:09.021
Well, tonight, Tank was almost my second.

25:09.055 --> 25:10.923
Almost?

25:10.957 --> 25:12.891
I stopped it. (Sighs)

25:14.060 --> 25:16.795
I know why I was nervous with Ty...

25:16.830 --> 25:21.000
I'd never done it
before... but now I... have.

25:21.034 --> 25:23.769
You think because you're not a virgin,

25:23.803 --> 25:25.738
you shouldn't have any hang-ups about sex?

25:28.908 --> 25:30.709
I wish that were true.

25:30.744 --> 25:32.044
So I'm not just being a prude?

25:32.078 --> 25:33.145
Of course not.

25:34.981 --> 25:37.116
It felt like he was expecting it,

25:37.150 --> 25:38.784
like I owed it to him.

25:38.818 --> 25:40.119
Which you don't.

25:40.153 --> 25:42.187
I just don't wanna do it again

25:42.222 --> 25:46.091
until I know what it means to me.

25:46.126 --> 25:48.861
You did the right thing,
putting the brakes on it tonight.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.963
Look...

25:50.997 --> 25:53.799
I completely get...

25:53.833 --> 25:54.867
that it's hard with guys...

25:54.901 --> 25:57.870
I mean, having the courage to say no.

25:57.904 --> 26:01.807
But you've gotta do it if you're not sure.

26:01.841 --> 26:03.742
And how they respond

26:03.777 --> 26:05.878
will tell you a whole lot about them.

26:07.847 --> 26:09.148
We have so much fun together,

26:09.182 --> 26:13.085
but I... don't know if he's ever gonna be

26:13.119 --> 26:14.887
the guy I want him to be.

26:18.858 --> 26:19.892

26:27.167 --> 26:29.101
Hey, dad. Remember, I'm the coach.

26:29.135 --> 26:30.769
Yes yes.

26:30.804 --> 26:32.104
Good. Listen, do you mind if I make

26:32.138 --> 26:34.773
one inspirational statement?

26:34.808 --> 26:35.941
Okay.

26:35.975 --> 26:37.776
- You may make one.
- Thank you.

26:37.811 --> 26:39.712
All right, listen up.

26:39.746 --> 26:41.780
I want you to give those Bulldogs

This is Chuy's agreement to sell.

29:03.723 --> 29:05.657
He signed it already?

29:05.692 --> 29:07.860
You said time was of the essence.

It is, it's just... wow.

29:20.907 --> 29:22.107
Not at all. It's just sometimes...

29:22.141 --> 29:25.077
sometimes, people get sentimental
about their properties,

29:25.111 --> 29:26.912
and they don't wanna let go.

Well, like you said, the terms of
the deal sort of sold themselves.

daughter's field hockey game,

29:54.007 --> 29:57.009

the retail space mock-ups.

watching clips of videos...

31:40.102 --> 31:42.870
- John: Come on! Come on!
- You can do it!

31:42.905 --> 31:44.872
Here we go, ladies!

31:44.907 --> 31:46.174
Come on! Stay with it!

31:56.919 --> 31:58.019
<i>Crowd: Ohh!</i>

31:58.053 --> 31:59.153
Come on, Ref!

31:59.188 --> 32:00.855
Are you okay?

32:00.889 --> 32:01.923
(Groaning) Yeah.

32:01.957 --> 32:03.224
It's so unfair! They
think they can get away

32:03.258 --> 32:04.759
with whatever they want.

32:04.793 --> 32:06.127
Yeah, well, they are getting away with it.

32:06.161 --> 32:07.895
It's not just them! Everywhere I look...

32:07.930 --> 32:09.997
Whoa, Katniss! Settle.

32:10.032 --> 32:11.833
- It just pisses me off.
- I know.

32:11.867 --> 32:13.167
- But we got a game, okay?
- Okay.

32:13.202 --> 32:14.769
Now we got less than a minute left.

32:14.803 --> 32:15.837
We can't let them shut us out.

32:15.871 --> 32:16.838
You get me that ball. You with me?

32:16.872 --> 32:19.006
- Yeah.
- Come on.

32:19.830 --> 32:23.228

- Whoo!
- Come on, come on, come on!

32:26.354 --> 32:28.556
(Girls shouting)

32:36.264 --> 32:37.465

(Indistinct shouts, cheers)

32:40.469 --> 32:42.336

- Go go go go go!

32:42.370 --> 32:44.472

33:01.389 --> 33:03.190
Whoo-hoo!

33:03.225 --> 33:05.426
They do know that they lost, right?

33:05.460 --> 33:07.261
Yeah, but they scored a goal.

33:07.295 --> 33:08.596
No victory is too small.

33:08.630 --> 33:10.164
Mwah!

33:10.198 --> 33:12.166
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

33:12.200 --> 33:13.300
Yeah!

33:13.335 --> 33:15.503
That's what I'm talking about!

33:15.537 --> 33:19.306
- You made every second count!

- Get over there and shake some hands!

33:32.220 --> 33:34.188
(Girls cheering)

33:36.424 --> 33:38.159
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

33:38.193 --> 33:39.260
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I thought you played a great game.

33:39.294 --> 33:40.494
- Thank you.
- Absolutely, yeah.

33:40.529 --> 33:41.529
I'd love for you to give me a call.

33:41.563 --> 33:44.532
<i>- Really?!
- Yeah.</i>

33:44.566 --> 33:45.633
Thank you, thank you.

33:45.667 --> 33:47.301
Sure.

34:00.215 --> 34:01.182
Hey.

34:03.185 --> 34:04.318
What are you doing here?

34:04.352 --> 34:06.253
Sorry I missed the game.

34:06.288 --> 34:07.588
It's cool.

34:09.357 --> 34:10.558
Um...

34:10.592 --> 34:13.594
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

34:13.628 --> 34:15.596
I don't expect you to...

34:15.630 --> 34:18.132
- Kinda seemed like you did.
- I know.

34:18.166 --> 34:19.567
I forget sometimes

34:19.601 --> 34:21.335
that you're still in high school.

34:21.369 --> 34:22.402
It's not the reason why...

34:22.437 --> 34:24.338
No, I know, I know, I know.

34:27.509 --> 34:30.143
What I mean is

34:30.178 --> 34:33.147
if it's too soon for you
to move to the next step,

34:33.181 --> 34:35.315
that's okay. I'll wait.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.152
You just tell me when.

34:40.188 --> 34:41.155
Okay.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.360
What are you doing?

34:47.395 --> 34:49.630
Just some homework.

34:49.664 --> 34:52.600
Can I hang out?

34:52.634 --> 34:54.534
Yeah.

34:54.569 --> 34:56.303
(Softly chuckles)

34:56.338 --> 35:00.374
So, what did they have to
say about Cornelius Buckner?

35:00.408 --> 35:02.376
(Both laugh)

35:06.248 --> 35:08.182
Hey, look who's coming up in the world.

35:08.216 --> 35:09.316
(Chuckling) Hi.

35:09.351 --> 35:11.585
That is one fine machine you got out there.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.487
Yeah, I'd give it back for a chance to see

35:13.521 --> 35:15.589
Daphne's final field hockey game.

35:15.624 --> 35:17.324
Uh, better you didn't.

35:17.359 --> 35:18.392
Was it that bad?

35:18.426 --> 35:20.461
Yeah, it was a beat-down.

35:20.495 --> 35:22.162
Well, at least we didn't get shut out.

35:22.197 --> 35:23.163
(Chuckles)

35:23.198 --> 35:24.431
There was this one great moment

35:24.466 --> 35:25.432
at the end of the game...

35:25.467 --> 35:27.167
(sighs) This job.

35:27.202 --> 35:28.402
<i>Price of success.</i>

35:28.436 --> 35:31.338
I have had that feeling many times.

35:31.373 --> 35:34.608
Actually, I wanted to ask you something.

35:34.643 --> 35:37.211
- I'm trying to understand it.
- Mm-hmm.

35:37.245 --> 35:40.581
This is a buyout agreement for a business

35:40.615 --> 35:42.216
we're tearing down in East Riverside

35:42.250 --> 35:43.450
- to make room for our project.
- Mm-hmm.

35:43.485 --> 35:45.386
And this is what we offered.

35:45.420 --> 35:48.389
10% over market value? Not bad.

35:48.423 --> 35:50.624
- Did he take it?
- He did,

35:50.659 --> 35:55.195
but then I found this.

35:55.230 --> 35:57.164
I mean, I shouldn't even have this.

35:57.198 --> 36:01.168
Our appraiser valued
the business at 30% more

36:01.202 --> 36:02.202
than what we offered.

36:02.237 --> 36:03.437
Am I reading that right?

36:03.471 --> 36:05.272
Yeah, that's right.

36:05.307 --> 36:08.108
So we lied to the owner

36:08.143 --> 36:10.244
about how much his business was worth

36:10.278 --> 36:11.478
in order to get a cheaper buyout?

36:11.513 --> 36:13.480
It's not illegal.

36:13.515 --> 36:14.581
Happens all the time.

36:14.616 --> 36:16.250
But is it fair?

36:17.452 --> 36:20.187
Okay, let me ask you something:

36:20.221 --> 36:22.323
Was the owner coerced into selling?

36:23.458 --> 36:24.525
Not exactly.

36:24.559 --> 36:26.593
Okay, he could have
hired his own appraiser,

36:26.628 --> 36:29.430
come up with his own number, negotiated.

36:29.464 --> 36:31.498
That's the way things usually happen.

36:33.301 --> 36:35.269
He didn't do that.

36:35.303 --> 36:36.337
He asked me what I thought,

36:36.371 --> 36:38.372
and I said it was a good deal.

36:38.406 --> 36:39.440
It is...

36:39.474 --> 36:41.542
for your boss.

36:41.576 --> 36:43.410
He got the place for a steal.

36:49.686 --> 36:51.620
Hey, Logan, what's up?

36:51.655 --> 36:54.256
Logan from the frame store?
Is our portrait finished?

36:54.291 --> 36:55.424
What?!

36:55.459 --> 36:57.360
Are... are you serious?

36:57.394 --> 37:00.529
No, it's for a friend of mine. (Scoffs)

37:00.564 --> 37:02.531
Are you absolutely sure?

37:04.301 --> 37:06.402
Thank you. Bye.

37:06.436 --> 37:07.570
Something wrong?

37:07.604 --> 37:10.306
(Exhales) I told Emmett I was gonna

37:10.340 --> 37:13.342
get a photo of Mandy's
printed and framed for him.

37:13.377 --> 37:15.344
Emmett's girlfriend Mandy?

37:15.379 --> 37:16.579
That's awfully nice of you.

37:16.613 --> 37:19.382
I took it to Logan, and that
was him calling to tell me

37:19.416 --> 37:21.450
Mandy didn't take that photo.

37:21.485 --> 37:22.551
A professional photographer did.

37:22.586 --> 37:23.686
It's copyrighted.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.521
- Oh.
- Yeah,

37:25.555 --> 37:28.557
I know, and now I have to tell Emmett.

37:28.592 --> 37:29.692
I'm sure he'll clear it up.

37:29.726 --> 37:31.427
Well... (Exhales)

37:31.461 --> 37:34.430
What if Logan's right and
the picture isn't Mandy's?

37:34.464 --> 37:35.631
Then I'm basically

37:35.665 --> 37:37.299
calling his girlfriend a liar.

37:37.334 --> 37:39.268
I think you owe it to
him to tell him the truth.

37:39.302 --> 37:40.669
(Sighs)

37:40.704 --> 37:42.371
I just thought by doing this,

37:42.406 --> 37:43.672
I could show Emmett that I'm totally cool

37:43.707 --> 37:45.341
with him dating somebody else,

37:45.375 --> 37:49.412
even if the somebody
else is long-distance.

37:49.446 --> 37:51.313
Are you?

37:54.618 --> 37:56.252
Yes.

38:00.690 --> 38:02.291
Hey.

38:02.325 --> 38:04.226
Hey.

38:04.261 --> 38:05.394
About last night...

38:05.429 --> 38:06.695
It's okay.

38:06.730 --> 38:08.364
We'll try again.

38:08.398 --> 38:11.367
Well, I shouldn't have
tried to stand up for you.

38:11.401 --> 38:13.436
It makes me so annoyed

38:13.470 --> 38:15.438
when hearing people do things for me

38:15.472 --> 38:16.705
or feel sorry for me.

38:16.740 --> 38:19.575
Oh, you feel sorry for me?

38:22.279 --> 38:23.412
Sometimes.

38:23.447 --> 38:25.414
(Softly sighs)

38:27.517 --> 38:29.485
I hate that you can't go rock climbing.

38:29.519 --> 38:32.388
I hate it too.

38:32.422 --> 38:35.458
God, I should know better. I should
know how to deal with stupid people.

38:35.492 --> 38:37.693
Daphne, I don't expect
you to get everything right

38:37.727 --> 38:40.529
just because you're deaf.

38:41.698 --> 38:43.466
I really like you.

38:45.602 --> 38:47.403
I really like you, too.

38:47.437 --> 38:49.738
(Exhales)

38:49.773 --> 38:53.375
But I guess I just don't know...

38:53.410 --> 38:56.212
how it would work.

38:56.246 --> 38:58.547
You mean...

38:58.582 --> 39:00.449
Yeah.

39:01.618 --> 39:03.686
Well, it would go

39:03.720 --> 39:05.221
something like this.

39:17.501 --> 39:19.301
Oh.

39:19.336 --> 39:20.536
Yeah.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.641
(Exhales)

39:28.578 --> 39:29.678
Hey.

39:29.713 --> 39:33.249
And again, I'm so sorry
I missed the game...

39:33.283 --> 39:35.351
But my mom would have

39:35.385 --> 39:39.421
literally disowned me if I hadn't spent
some time with her while I was here.

39:39.456 --> 39:41.257
It's totally cool. There'll be more to see.

39:42.692 --> 39:44.627
Toby, we need to talk about this.

39:45.695 --> 39:47.596
Okay.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.433
Hey hey, come on, come on.

39:53.737 --> 39:55.671
Being in Peru...

39:55.705 --> 39:58.374
with those people...

39:58.408 --> 40:01.510
it makes me feel like
my life means something.

40:02.579 --> 40:04.547
And when my dad died...

40:05.582 --> 40:07.283
I spun out,

40:07.317 --> 40:09.618
I was searching

40:09.653 --> 40:11.620
and you were part of the answer.

40:12.789 --> 40:17.526
And now I feel like I found the rest of it.

40:18.795 --> 40:21.363
Are you, uh...

40:21.398 --> 40:23.566
are you saying you don't wanna...

40:23.600 --> 40:25.301
be with me anymore?

40:25.335 --> 40:26.302
Of course I do.

40:26.336 --> 40:27.736
But this work...

40:27.771 --> 40:31.740
I feel like it's going to be my life.

40:31.775 --> 40:34.543
I felt God tugging at my heart.

40:34.578 --> 40:37.379
So...

40:37.414 --> 40:39.448
what, I'm, uh...

40:39.482 --> 40:41.717
supposed to just follow
you around the globe?

40:41.751 --> 40:43.552
No, I'm not asking you to do that.

40:43.587 --> 40:44.753
Well then, what are you asking?

40:44.788 --> 40:47.690
Is there any way

40:47.724 --> 40:50.459
you might ever want to come with me?

40:54.531 --> 40:55.531
(Deeply sighs)

40:55.565 --> 40:57.533
<i>I just don't know</i>

40:57.567 --> 40:59.635
how that could ever feel...

40:59.669 --> 41:01.337
like my life.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.405
And I don't know if I
could ever just move back.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.307
I don't wanna just fund-raise

41:05.342 --> 41:06.375
or send e-mails.

41:06.409 --> 41:08.544
I want to help these people,

41:08.578 --> 41:11.413
hands-on.

41:11.448 --> 41:14.416
That's where my heart is.

41:19.723 --> 41:21.690
Well, I, um...

41:21.725 --> 41:24.293
I don't know how we're supposed to...

41:24.327 --> 41:28.297
stay married if we don't even
live on the same continent.
