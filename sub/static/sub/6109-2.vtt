00:41.584 --> 00:43.128
Enough.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.880
Any more fluid and her eyes
will pop like champagne corks.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.590
Sorry.

00:47.757 --> 00:50.844
Uhh, skin is pink and rigid.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.846
The index of the arterial
solution is wrong.

00:53.012 --> 00:55.265
What percentage formaldehyde
did you use?

00:55.432 --> 00:57.267
I followed the formula.

00:57.434 --> 01:00.270
If you had, she wouldn't
be as hard as a carrot.

01:00.437 --> 01:01.813
Well, maybe...

01:01.980 --> 01:04.107
There are no 'maybe's
when preparing the dead.

01:07.193 --> 01:10.238
Let me see how you
aspirate the cavity.

01:25.837 --> 01:28.757
You're liquefying organs,
not performing liposuction.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.720
Let's try to finish this
by tonight.

01:38.892 --> 01:41.144
Oh, shit! Jesus!

01:41.311 --> 01:42.937
The family hired us to prepare

01:43.104 --> 01:45.523
their loved one for eternal
rest, not defile the dead.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.358
Sorry. I didn't
mean to defile...

01:47.525 --> 01:49.652
Just go while I try
to unfuck this mess.

01:49.819 --> 01:51.946
I think I know what
I did wrong. Next time...

01:52.113 --> 01:54.157
No more next times.
You're fired.

02:02.624 --> 02:04.793
<i>You got fired? Again?</i>

02:06.753 --> 02:09.964
I mean, you have no idea how
completely fucked-up death is.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.800
<i>Before this, it was accounting</i>

02:11.966 --> 02:14.719
<i>after you were shitcanned
by the driving school.</i>

02:14.886 --> 02:18.556
I just haven't figured out
what colour my parachute is.

02:18.723 --> 02:22.268
<i>This baby growing inside me
on account of you</i>

02:22.435 --> 02:26.439
<i>is gonna need food, diapers,
and braces and college tuition.</i>

02:26.606 --> 02:28.691
I'll start sending out
my resume tomorrow!

02:28.858 --> 02:31.319
<i>You walk in this apartment
unemployed again,</i>

02:31.486 --> 02:33.112
<i>you're gonna be the one
on the table</i>

02:33.279 --> 02:34.989
<i>getting your insides
hoovered out,</i>

02:35.156 --> 02:37.325
<i>and, trust me,
I am not playing.</i>

02:42.664 --> 02:45.542
I'm prepared
to do whatever it takes.

02:45.708 --> 02:48.044
Layla?

02:50.505 --> 02:52.382
Ohh...

02:56.970 --> 02:58.763
Uhh!

04:24.474 --> 04:26.142
Annie?

04:37.195 --> 04:38.905
Rich people
always have...

04:39.072 --> 04:41.366
..the best bathrooms.

04:44.285 --> 04:45.828
I thought you split.

04:45.995 --> 04:49.332
It's a bright, sunny morning
in the Age of Aquarius

04:49.499 --> 04:52.627
and that meth-head
is somewhere else by now.

04:52.794 --> 04:55.088
Yeah, that wasn't a meth-head.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.131
I'm not even sure it was human.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.634
Whatever the fuck it was,
it went straight for my chest.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.511
Yeah, but you're safe now.

05:02.512 --> 05:04.806
And I should be
getting back to my hotel.

05:04.973 --> 05:06.724
So you are disappearing, huh?

05:06.891 --> 05:09.686
Didn't mean to ruin
your breakfast.

05:14.273 --> 05:16.109
How often do you feed?

05:17.360 --> 05:19.862
When I get hungry.

05:21.114 --> 05:22.949
What do you do with the bodies?

05:23.950 --> 05:26.035
You actually think
I kill people?

05:26.202 --> 05:28.037
Don't you?

05:29.038 --> 05:32.917
No. I mean, not anymore.

05:33.084 --> 05:35.586
It's not like we're still
living in the Dark Ages.

05:35.753 --> 05:38.214
Hasn't anyone shown you?

05:38.381 --> 05:40.008
Shown me what?

05:40.174 --> 05:42.343
How to live in the wild.

05:44.095 --> 05:46.180
I'm the only upir I know.

05:48.266 --> 05:50.351
What about your parents?

05:52.562 --> 05:54.355
I'm a self-starter.

05:56.858 --> 06:00.862
Well, I certainly don't
go around butchering people.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.032
So school me.

06:08.161 --> 06:11.622
Most of us work in jobs
that keep us close to blood -

06:11.789 --> 06:14.542
doctors, lab techs, EMTs.

06:14.709 --> 06:17.503
- Where do you fit in?
- ER nurse.

06:17.670 --> 06:21.632
Hmph. Must be like a kid
in a candy store.

06:28.765 --> 06:30.349
Roman?!

06:34.729 --> 06:36.397
What the fuck happened?

06:47.867 --> 06:49.619
There. Isn't that better?

07:03.424 --> 07:04.967
Thank you.

07:15.394 --> 07:18.564
Now you don't need me to help
you with these every morning.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.400
Do I have to?

07:22.902 --> 07:25.029
You'll feel better if you do.

07:26.489 --> 07:29.450
I don't feel anything
when I take them.

07:29.617 --> 07:33.704
Oh, darling,
that is a good thing.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.666
Your problem has been that
you've always felt too much.

07:59.021 --> 08:01.065
Now open wide.

08:05.194 --> 08:06.737
Good girl.

08:25.756 --> 08:29.635
Hi. I...I am so sorry
for the intrusion.

08:29.802 --> 08:32.972
But, um, I'm a patient
of Dr Godfrey's.

08:33.139 --> 08:35.892
Was...is...am.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.227
But I saw you
in the market yesterday

08:38.394 --> 08:40.855
and I recognised you
from the photo on his desk.

08:41.022 --> 08:42.648
You followed me?

08:42.815 --> 08:44.442
I was hoping
that you could help me

08:44.609 --> 08:46.277
get in touch with Dr Godfrey.

08:46.444 --> 08:48.654
He never notified me
that he was leaving

08:48.821 --> 08:51.032
and his mail's piling up.

08:51.199 --> 08:53.868
I...I was worried about him.

08:54.035 --> 08:55.912
Mmm.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.248
Um...

08:59.415 --> 09:02.960
If you don't mind, my daughter
was very close with Dr Godfrey,

09:03.127 --> 09:04.754
and I don't want to upset her.

09:04.921 --> 09:06.964
Oh, of course.
I'm not looking to upset anyone.

09:07.131 --> 09:10.092
You know, I try to put on
a brave face for her,

09:10.259 --> 09:13.721
but Norman left so suddenly
with no real explanation.

09:13.888 --> 09:16.724
- It's been difficult.
- I can only imagine.

09:16.891 --> 09:18.976
And so unlike Dr Godfrey.

09:19.143 --> 09:21.145
Which is why
I'm beginning to worry

09:21.312 --> 09:22.897
something may have
happened to him.

09:23.064 --> 09:26.359
No, it's way too early
to give in to despair.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.152
That's what
I keep telling myself,

09:28.319 --> 09:30.071
but he took off to London,

09:30.238 --> 09:32.406
said he needed
some time for himself.

09:32.573 --> 09:35.076
Then he stopped calling.

09:35.243 --> 09:37.286
I still have some friends
at Scotland Yard

09:37.453 --> 09:39.747
from my time
on the London stage.

09:39.914 --> 09:42.917
I reached out to them. I just
wanted to make sure he was OK.

09:43.084 --> 09:46.545
- Did they find anything?
- No, nothing so far.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.422
Which is better
than a corpse, I guess.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.675
Uh...

09:52.301 --> 09:57.265
Um, why don't you
leave me your number

09:57.431 --> 10:00.351
and then the moment we hear from
Norman, I'll give you a call.

10:00.518 --> 10:03.062
Uh, that would be...
that would be great.

10:03.229 --> 10:05.439
I would truly appreciate that.

10:05.606 --> 10:09.527
And, um, let me just say, I knew
you were innocent all along.

10:09.694 --> 10:11.570
Free Shelley.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.117
'Bye.

10:19.203 --> 10:23.374
Why don't you ever talk
about Uncle Norman with me?

10:25.293 --> 10:27.920
He's gone and, um...

10:28.087 --> 10:30.965
..it's painful for all of us.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.597
You think this had
anything to do with those guys?

10:38.764 --> 10:42.560
Could have been, but it
doesn't seem like their style.

10:42.727 --> 10:45.896
What about the other one,
from the White Tower?

10:46.063 --> 10:50.318
- The rooftop guy?
- Yeah. No.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.112
I don't know.
We have to find out either way.

10:53.279 --> 10:55.614
What on earth
are you guys talking about?

10:56.741 --> 10:59.493
Can you be a gentleman for once
and call your date a cab?

10:59.660 --> 11:02.496
Who said
she's going anywhere?

11:07.835 --> 11:09.879
Just hang out for a sec, OK?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.802
I'd be dead
if it wasn't for her.

11:16.969 --> 11:18.596
And you want to thank her

11:18.763 --> 11:20.473
by getting her hip-deep
in our shit?

11:20.639 --> 11:22.516
- She's different.
- Yeah.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.685
I don't care how well trained
her gag reflex is...

11:24.852 --> 11:27.563
She's an upir.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.398
She tracked me down somehow,

11:29.565 --> 11:31.400
said she was looking
for others like her.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.569
So she's stalking you.

11:33.736 --> 11:38.157
We ended up
kind of stalking each other.

11:38.324 --> 11:41.035
OK, so...so with everything
we've got going on right now,

11:41.202 --> 11:43.621
you think you should trust her
just because she's an upir?

11:43.788 --> 11:45.790
No. I don't know.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.793
If she wanted to hurt me,
she could have let that thing

11:48.959 --> 11:50.753
last night finish the job,
but she didn't.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.713
And if you scare her off,

11:52.880 --> 11:55.758
I'll never know how
she fits in to any of this

11:55.925 --> 12:00.429
or how I fit in...
to things in general.

12:26.122 --> 12:27.790
Hey there!

12:28.791 --> 12:30.751
Hey, we're in here.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.754
You forgot some clothes.

12:38.717 --> 12:41.846
- What the fuck?
- Someone broke in.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.473
Not someone. Something.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.518
- You don't know that.
- No, I think I do.

13:09.415 --> 13:10.916
What is she doing?

13:49.580 --> 13:52.124
We need
to take her to a hospital.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.126
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- No. This is serious.

13:54.293 --> 13:55.753
You could have
some internal bleeding.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.838
It's OK. She's a psychic.

14:00.758 --> 14:02.968
- So what was it?
- I don't know.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.137
I don't want to.

14:05.304 --> 14:07.223
But after it attacked you,

14:07.389 --> 14:11.977
I think it went to that mortuary
on Holden Street.

14:13.521 --> 14:17.358
- What do you think?
- We should check it out.

14:29.495 --> 14:31.163
What do you have for me?

14:32.414 --> 14:34.083
Interview transcripts.

14:35.334 --> 14:37.878
Spivak's credit report.

14:39.088 --> 14:41.924
Military service record
for Miranda's father.

14:42.091 --> 14:44.176
And...

14:44.343 --> 14:47.304
..the proposed scope of the
investigation moving forward.

14:48.305 --> 14:52.017
Did you know that the name
'Spivak' is Ukrainian?

14:52.184 --> 14:55.145
- It means 'song'.
- Fascinating.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.897
I got nothing.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.692
But unless I keep generating
what looks like work product,

14:59.858 --> 15:01.485
Roman's gonna quit
opening his wallet.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.904
And that would
be bad for both of us.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.076
Here is something interesting.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.122
I found this in Spivak's
apartment a while back.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.876
Who was Ryan Dunbrack?

15:19.295 --> 15:20.754
It took a lot of searching,

15:20.921 --> 15:26.260
but this...is Dunbrack there.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.723
That photo was taken
70 years ago.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.642
Spivak hasn't aged a bit.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.979
Can you fucking believe that?

15:37.146 --> 15:39.940
It does strain credulity.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.775
Now, either I've discovered

15:41.942 --> 15:45.779
a tear in the
space-time continuum or...

15:48.490 --> 15:52.494
..it's gotta be Spivak's
old man, right?

15:53.495 --> 15:55.080
Dead ringer.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.709
So I gave Roman this big pile
of nothing to chew on.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.961
Hope it's enough
to keep him paying out.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.089
But I don't know.
It seems mighty thin.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.053
I, uh...

16:09.219 --> 16:13.015
..I think it's time I told you
the truth about my son.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.397
The Vikings, right?

16:20.564 --> 16:22.816
Terror of the northern seas,
axes dripping with blood,

16:22.983 --> 16:25.027
villages burned
to the ground, rape.

16:25.194 --> 16:27.696
Oh, if you two ever
fell into their clutches,

16:27.863 --> 16:31.200
I shudder to think what they'd
do to you, great horned devils.

16:31.367 --> 16:35.245
Anyway, the Vikings,
they took their shields,

16:35.412 --> 16:39.708
dented and blood-stained
in battle, right,

16:39.875 --> 16:42.127
heated them up,
poured batter on them

16:42.294 --> 16:45.130
and the ebelskiver was born.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.883
Huh, look at that. Voila!

16:49.176 --> 16:52.096
That is breakfast
south of the Galdhopiggen.

16:53.097 --> 16:56.517
A lot of controversy surrounds
this little piece of paradise.

16:56.684 --> 17:00.896
Baking soda versus yeast,
maple syrup versus honey,

17:01.063 --> 17:02.731
plain old sugar...

17:02.898 --> 17:04.483
And, my Lord, there's been,
like, you know,

17:04.650 --> 17:06.984
a 300-year holy war
over the stuffing.

17:07.152 --> 17:12.116
Apple slices,
dried fruit, jam, berries.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.451
Even cheese, for God's sake.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.912
But the key
to ebelskivers, ladies,

17:17.079 --> 17:19.080
is, uh, the lemon zest.

17:19.248 --> 17:21.875
- Shut up. Shut up.
- That's the key. Lemon zest.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.169
Shut up, OK? Shut up!

17:24.336 --> 17:26.296
Ugh!

17:29.174 --> 17:31.844
Huh?

17:33.303 --> 17:36.598
After all our years
together, huh?

17:36.765 --> 17:38.434
How many flu seasons
have we been through?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.144
This is how you treat me?

17:42.020 --> 17:45.107
Oh, my God!

17:50.696 --> 17:52.364
Ohh...

17:52.531 --> 17:54.908
So looking forward
to getting out of the city.

17:55.075 --> 17:58.412
Just me and the girls, huh?

18:01.290 --> 18:03.876
It's supposed to be
all snow angels, reindeers

18:04.042 --> 18:05.919
and cosy evenings by the fire,
then this.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.881
Oh, well. Come on, girl.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.887
Ohh!

18:32.237 --> 18:34.031
Hey!

18:37.326 --> 18:39.703
After all markers have
been exhaustively inspected,

18:39.870 --> 18:44.166
comma, 632 AFLP markers
were recorded, full stop.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.543
Construction of the
first-generation linkage map

18:46.710 --> 18:48.629
proved successful, semi-colon,

18:48.796 --> 18:52.090
however, comma,
I have jack shit.

18:55.594 --> 18:58.138
You're either doing
too many drugs or too few.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.724
Do you have a specific need
or is this one of your

19:00.891 --> 19:03.310
"I think I'll go fuck
with Pryce" visits?

19:05.020 --> 19:06.814
I have received some information

19:06.980 --> 19:09.900
about our dear friend Dr Spivak.

19:10.067 --> 19:14.363
Now, why don't you be a dear
and fetch me some nutrient?

19:18.158 --> 19:22.120
Essex. Essex.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.248
Essex. Lime. Lime.

19:24.414 --> 19:27.125
Plum. Yes! Plum.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.086
What the fuck
are you babbling about?

19:31.213 --> 19:34.216
- Johann?
- What?

19:35.717 --> 19:38.053
May I keep these?

19:38.220 --> 19:40.055
Help yourself.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.310
Now, what does a girl have to do

19:45.477 --> 19:48.105
to get a glass
of hemo around here?

19:48.272 --> 19:50.148
The nutrient? I flushed it.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.526
You did what?!

19:52.693 --> 19:55.529
You have only yourself to blame.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.866
Huh!

22:22.384 --> 22:25.178
- Oh, get my kite down.
- It's on that branch.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.764
You have to chop it down
or something, but we can't.

22:27.931 --> 22:31.184
- It will break!
- I can get that down for you.

22:53.331 --> 22:57.210
There we go.
You're such a good girl.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.671
Come here. Come here.

23:03.133 --> 23:04.760
Ohh...

23:04.926 --> 23:07.679
There we go. There we go.

23:11.683 --> 23:15.562
Yeah. Ohh...!

23:37.667 --> 23:39.252
Miranda?

23:43.048 --> 23:45.300
What are you doing?

23:53.850 --> 23:56.478
That little girl's getting
bigger every day, huh?

23:58.230 --> 23:59.773
The ocular chromatic
progression's

23:59.940 --> 24:01.483
just turned out beautiful.

24:01.650 --> 24:03.401
I mean, those eyes of hers,

24:03.568 --> 24:07.823
just a much calmer
arctic blue now, aren't they?

24:08.990 --> 24:10.826
Don't have to worry about
haemorrhaging to death

24:10.992 --> 24:12.828
every time the kid
feels threatened now.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.872
What did you do to her?

24:20.919 --> 24:23.547
I really ought to show you
the basement sometime

24:23.713 --> 24:28.176
because there are some wondrous
things to see down there...

24:29.177 --> 24:34.558
..because the times, baby,
they are a-changing.

27:13.758 --> 27:16.511
You don't want to fuck
with Croatian pussy, my friend.

27:17.512 --> 27:19.222
It sucks you right inside.

27:19.389 --> 27:21.016
Time stands still

27:21.182 --> 27:23.476
till finally you have to
claw your way back out

27:23.643 --> 27:25.270
like you're being born again.

27:25.437 --> 27:28.440
A lot of fish had to fuck
to make that much caviar, huh?

27:29.816 --> 27:31.609
You were smart to come to us.

27:31.776 --> 27:33.361
Been wanting
to get into business

27:33.528 --> 27:35.113
with you guys for a while.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.823
This seemed like
the right opportunity.

27:36.990 --> 27:40.118
I count 100 units
and if we give you 22-5 each...

27:40.285 --> 27:42.454
Mmm, that's a little low.

27:42.620 --> 27:45.290
Consider it a discount

27:45.457 --> 27:47.417
that will generate
future opportunity.

27:49.419 --> 27:51.588
Best and final.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.388
Let's do it.

28:01.723 --> 28:04.809
So that's 2.25 for the caviar.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.020
Let's say 50K for the truck.

28:07.187 --> 28:10.065
Please, it's no charge
for the truck.

28:10.231 --> 28:11.900
A gift to our new friends.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.693
I learned
a long time ago

28:13.860 --> 28:16.363
never to accept
anything free from a Gypsy.

28:18.281 --> 28:20.325
So with the truck,

28:20.492 --> 28:24.079
you lucky pikers
are $2.3 million richer.

28:26.623 --> 28:27.957
What the fuck's going on?

28:28.124 --> 28:30.460
Last night there were
only 50 crates.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.670
And only
$1 million on the table.

28:32.837 --> 28:35.799
Huh! What a difference
a day makes.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.967
You stepped on them.

28:40.303 --> 28:42.138
I found a way
to make us more money.

28:44.641 --> 28:47.102
And I didn't tell you 'cause
I didn't want you freakin' out.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.229
- Like this.
- This?

28:49.396 --> 28:51.022
This isn't me freaking out.

28:51.189 --> 28:54.067
This is me trying to figure out
what to do when shit goes off.

28:54.234 --> 28:56.611
Trust me. I have everything
under control.

29:00.824 --> 29:03.910
Milan's got a guy - the Tongue.

29:04.077 --> 29:06.037
He wants to test the merch.

29:06.204 --> 29:08.873
The Tongue? Really? They got
a guy called the Tongue?

29:09.040 --> 29:11.543
- Peter...
- Fuck the caviar and the money.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.878
Let's go before they
figure out what you did.

29:14.045 --> 29:17.257
Come on. Come on.

29:19.592 --> 29:23.638
You keep your shit together
out there, OK?

29:51.791 --> 29:53.585
Come on.

30:13.730 --> 30:16.733
- Shit.
- What?

30:18.234 --> 30:20.361
I'm getting a lot of noise.

30:20.528 --> 30:22.822
Nothing specific,
but there's definitely

30:22.989 --> 30:24.741
something not right here.

30:24.908 --> 30:28.203
No shit something's not
right here. Look at this place.

30:32.165 --> 30:36.169
Mortuaries are like cemeteries.

30:37.170 --> 30:38.838
It's like being tuned in

30:39.005 --> 30:41.549
to a hundred different
radio stations at once.

30:41.716 --> 30:45.678
Look, this thing was after me.
What are we dealing with here?

30:45.845 --> 30:49.516
Why don't you two take a look
around and let me do my thing?

30:49.682 --> 30:51.309
You gonna be OK?

30:51.476 --> 30:53.520
Yeah, I'm totally
down with the dead.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.522
They don't lie,
they don't pick their noses

30:55.688 --> 30:58.900
and...they don't
break your heart.

30:59.067 --> 31:01.236
Alright.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.701
You know, I'm so glad

31:08.868 --> 31:10.495
you came around
on the meat-eating thing.

31:10.662 --> 31:13.122
That's how the human brain
evolved, you know?

31:15.833 --> 31:17.460
What is it?

31:17.627 --> 31:20.755
I'm not sure. Um...

31:20.922 --> 31:23.132
A deer, I think.

31:23.299 --> 31:26.636
Life in the wild, huh?

31:26.803 --> 31:31.474
No doubt drawn by the salt-lick
I put out back.

31:31.641 --> 31:35.812
Nature on parade,
unsullied by man.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.360
- Huh!
- Arggh!

32:00.378 --> 32:02.213
Come on. Come on.

32:02.380 --> 32:04.048
Ugh...

32:04.215 --> 32:05.925
Oh!

32:10.847 --> 32:13.474
I'm coming back for you.

32:27.155 --> 32:30.116
<i>Were Adam and Eve
really alien visitors?</i>

32:30.283 --> 32:32.493
<i>- That's what a new...</i>
- Be specific.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.455
There are 38 races of aliens,
you waste of clothes.

32:35.622 --> 32:38.625
Bernarians. Silians.

32:38.791 --> 32:42.837
Alpha-draconians.
Zeta-reticulans.

32:43.004 --> 32:46.215
Naga. Iguanoids. The Greys.

32:46.382 --> 32:50.386
Dogons. The Little People.
The Nordics.

32:50.553 --> 32:52.639
Fricking idiot.

32:54.932 --> 32:57.894
Did Norman come back?
Is he OK?

32:59.062 --> 33:00.772
No, sadly.

33:00.938 --> 33:03.232
Um, I just needed
someone to talk to.

33:04.734 --> 33:07.320
And your address
was on your card, so...

33:07.487 --> 33:09.280
Um, come in.

33:10.615 --> 33:14.827
Oh, I love the colour choices.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.704
Did your wife pick those out?

33:16.871 --> 33:18.539
No, no, no.

33:18.706 --> 33:21.250
The tone-on-tone is all me.

33:21.417 --> 33:25.338
I'm looking for a taupe couch,
you know, to change things up.

33:25.505 --> 33:29.759
- Mmm.
- I can do whatever I want now.

33:29.926 --> 33:32.345
She left me.

33:33.346 --> 33:35.306
Oh, I am so sorry to hear that.

33:35.473 --> 33:39.060
Ehh, it's for the best.
But how are you holding up?

33:39.227 --> 33:42.021
I don't know.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.524
I keep worrying.
What if he's not coming back?

33:44.691 --> 33:46.859
There's so many things
I want to tell him.

33:47.026 --> 33:49.529
Write them down.
That's what I do.

33:49.696 --> 33:51.864
Oh, that's a good idea.

33:52.031 --> 33:54.033
No, I...I write everything down.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.829
It's one of the reasons why
the wife left, she tells me -

33:57.995 --> 34:00.748
I wrote everything down
instead of saying it to her.

34:00.915 --> 34:03.793
Well, it's sometimes
easier that way.

34:03.960 --> 34:07.213
I never told Dr Godfrey
she left me.

34:07.380 --> 34:09.882
I didn't want to come off
sounding like a failure.

34:10.049 --> 34:13.594
Oh, he wouldn't have judged you.
He wasn't that sort of man.

34:13.761 --> 34:17.181
Would you mind if we didn't talk
about him in the past tense?

34:17.348 --> 34:19.600
- Just...just superstitious.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

34:19.766 --> 34:23.646
I'm just...giving in
to my worst fears, I suppose.

34:23.813 --> 34:27.024
Well, I am holding
a high thought that he's OK.

34:27.190 --> 34:31.696
Ohh, you remind me
of Norman in so many ways.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.657
That is a nice thing to say,

34:34.824 --> 34:40.288
but I'm not as strong
as he was...is.

34:40.455 --> 34:42.998
I'm not as strong as he is.

34:44.041 --> 34:46.460
He's a good man.

34:46.627 --> 34:49.589
Arggh! Arggh!

34:55.344 --> 34:57.680
I'm bleeding!

34:57.847 --> 34:59.807
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

35:01.768 --> 35:05.438
Oh, God! That's a new
fucking carpet!

35:05.605 --> 35:07.398
Ohh...

35:18.409 --> 35:20.036
The Caspian sturgeon

35:20.203 --> 35:22.538
has been hunted
to the brink of extinction.

35:22.705 --> 35:25.541
You'll find it on America's
list of endangered species,

35:25.708 --> 35:28.044
which, of course,
makes it illegal to import,

35:28.211 --> 35:30.171
thus incredibly rare.

35:30.338 --> 35:33.382
And incredibly expensive.

35:37.094 --> 35:38.930
Which is why
most of the beluga caviar

35:39.096 --> 35:41.140
sold in the US is counterfeit -

35:41.307 --> 35:45.436
good for me because
I specialise in authentication.

35:45.603 --> 35:49.982
I'll be surprised
if this product is legitimate,

35:50.149 --> 35:52.276
especially considering
the source.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.654
Is your fucking tongue
limbered up enough yet?

36:07.375 --> 36:09.669
The proof is in the taste...

36:10.670 --> 36:13.673
..and the texture.

36:23.891 --> 36:27.228
This is pure Caspian sturgeon,
as advertised.

36:27.395 --> 36:30.106
Oh, yeah.

36:51.878 --> 36:54.213
- Are...are you OK?
- Help me, please.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.465
Please. Do you have
a cell phone?

36:56.632 --> 37:00.845
Uhh...I don't think
I get service.

37:01.012 --> 37:04.265
Ohh...

37:19.155 --> 37:21.324
Come on.

37:24.994 --> 37:26.621
Hi there.

37:26.787 --> 37:29.165
- Hey. How you doing?
- You're looking for someone?

37:29.332 --> 37:31.000
- Yeah, my wife.
- Yeah.

37:31.167 --> 37:33.294
She's...she's just
borrowing my phone.

37:33.461 --> 37:38.132
Miranda? Sweetie?
Where are you?

37:38.299 --> 37:40.343
- Is she OK?
- Yeah, yeah, she'll be back.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.511
We had a little fight.
You know gals.

37:42.678 --> 37:44.513
- Oh, what have you got here?
- Oh, this is...

37:44.680 --> 37:46.557
This is our little guy.

37:47.934 --> 37:49.894
Oh, cool. I'm a paediatrician.

37:50.061 --> 37:51.771
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

37:51.938 --> 37:54.482
Hey, man. Let me take
a look. Alright.

37:54.649 --> 37:57.026
Oh, my Lord, you're a big fella!
Oi, oi, oi!

37:57.193 --> 37:59.028
Could you take
a quick look at this?

37:59.195 --> 38:00.905
What is it?

38:01.072 --> 38:03.741
Oh, just under...
under his cap there. Yeah.

38:03.908 --> 38:05.534
Oh,
it's a little cradle cap.

38:05.701 --> 38:07.745
Yeah. Little cradle cap.
Nothing to worry about.

38:07.912 --> 38:09.872
Should clear up
in a week or two

38:10.039 --> 38:11.832
with baby shampoo
and warm water, alright?

38:11.999 --> 38:15.252
But not too warm, Daddy.
Don't make it too warm!

38:15.419 --> 38:17.672
Hey! There you are.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.469
Isn't this a cute baby?

38:23.636 --> 38:26.973
You know who'd love to pinch
this little guy's cheeks?

38:27.139 --> 38:29.475
Pearl.

38:29.642 --> 38:33.562
Yes, she would.
Yes, she would. Ohh!

38:33.729 --> 38:36.899
Pearl would be, like,
in baby heaven.

38:37.066 --> 38:39.360
- Pearl's my nurse.
- Oh, OK.

38:39.527 --> 38:41.654
- She was.
- Oh.

38:42.697 --> 38:44.323
We better be getting home now.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.033
Ohh...

38:46.200 --> 38:48.327
Oh!

38:50.329 --> 38:54.834
Yeah. Why don't you get
in the car, warm up?

38:55.001 --> 38:56.877
Thanks for letting
the missus call home.

38:57.044 --> 38:59.964
Oh, well, lucky for her
you were already on your way,

39:00.131 --> 39:02.466
what with the bad
cell phone coverage out here.

39:02.633 --> 39:05.219
Yeah, lucky for her.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.471
There he is.

39:12.476 --> 39:14.145
What is this?

39:14.311 --> 39:16.355
- I think it's dinner.
- Holy shit!

39:16.522 --> 39:21.110
Most mortuaries just wash the
blood and guts down the drain.

39:21.277 --> 39:22.987
Then what's this for?

39:23.154 --> 39:26.282
Some turn it over
to medical waste companies.

39:26.449 --> 39:28.659
Medical waste, huh?

39:28.826 --> 39:31.120
OK, be a snob.

39:31.287 --> 39:34.832
You can either go hungry
or feed on the living.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.717
Mmm!

39:44.884 --> 39:47.053
Ahh... What?

39:47.219 --> 39:50.556
- It's cold.
- Well, it's refrigerated.

39:57.104 --> 40:00.399
What did you see?

40:05.780 --> 40:08.074
May I?

40:09.075 --> 40:10.868
Knock yourself out.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.670
- Eugh.
- It's just blood.

40:21.837 --> 40:24.131
Once it stops pumping,
gravity takes over

40:24.298 --> 40:26.383
and it all settles
to the bottom.

40:33.307 --> 40:36.852
"Renal failure."
That means unfiltered.

40:37.019 --> 40:40.022
We found refrigerated
blood downstairs.

40:40.189 --> 40:42.650
"Drug overdose." Nope.

40:42.817 --> 40:45.694
Here we go. "Gunshot wound."

40:54.829 --> 40:56.914
See this? No blood.

40:57.081 --> 41:00.000
He's been completely drained.

41:04.213 --> 41:05.840
The owner of this mortuary,

41:06.006 --> 41:09.885
the one who got her chest
ripped out, she was upir.

41:11.679 --> 41:14.765
That blood downstairs
was some bottom-shelf shit.

41:14.932 --> 41:17.726
But a healthy young man gets
shot, that is some fine dining.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.520
There was another upir

41:19.687 --> 41:21.522
five miles from my house
and I never knew?

41:21.689 --> 41:24.525
Half the morticians
in the country are upir.

41:24.692 --> 41:26.694
Trust me.

41:28.946 --> 41:31.323
I'm getting cremated.

41:32.616 --> 41:34.618
So that means that
that thing that attacked me...

41:34.785 --> 41:37.788
Was hunting upirs.

41:37.955 --> 41:39.623
Yeah.

41:42.918 --> 41:44.545
We need to talk.

41:44.712 --> 41:46.338
You can apologise
tomorrow, my friend.

41:46.505 --> 41:48.507
Tonight is for celebrating!

41:48.674 --> 41:50.467
You could have killed everyone
today because you...

41:50.634 --> 41:52.845
Stepped on the caviar?

41:53.012 --> 41:55.181
What would've happened
if we failed that taste test?

41:55.347 --> 41:56.974
There was never
any chance of that.

41:57.141 --> 41:58.893
The Tongue's got no love
for the Croats.

41:59.059 --> 42:01.478
They own his ass and they
never let him forget it.

42:01.645 --> 42:04.857
- How do you know that?
- Me and him go way back.

42:05.024 --> 42:09.737
Did a couple favours,
made some problems go away...

42:09.904 --> 42:11.530
That still doesn't...

42:11.697 --> 42:14.366
I paid him 50 grand
to seal the deal.

42:14.533 --> 42:17.870
We were fine.

42:18.037 --> 42:19.872
To Andreas!

42:20.039 --> 42:23.167
Andreas!

42:23.334 --> 42:25.127
Whoo!

42:25.294 --> 42:27.254
Hey.

42:27.421 --> 42:30.382
- If you ever walk me into...
- Peter, you're so dramatic!

42:30.549 --> 42:32.968
You could've made
my cousin a widow.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.722
OK, look.

42:36.889 --> 42:39.642
I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

42:39.808 --> 42:43.145
But everything I did
was for Destiny

42:43.312 --> 42:44.939
so we could get
our lives straight.

42:45.105 --> 42:46.649
I got a plan.

42:46.815 --> 42:49.693
I'm gonna use
my cut of the money

42:49.860 --> 42:52.404
to buy a fleet
of ice-cream trucks.

42:52.571 --> 42:55.824
- Ice-cream trucks?
- Yeah.

42:58.410 --> 43:01.497
So you're gonna put on a white
shirt and be the ice-cream man?

43:01.664 --> 43:04.959
No. I'm gonna own the fleet.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.586
And here's the beauty of it.

43:07.753 --> 43:11.840
I'm gonna use the trucks to
make a little book on the side.

43:12.007 --> 43:14.635
Sell a little ice-cream,
make the kids happy.

43:14.802 --> 43:17.763
Make a little book,
keep the adults happy.

43:17.930 --> 43:23.560
Kids happy, adults happy -
everybody's happy, right?

43:24.561 --> 43:27.982
It is going to be beautiful.

43:30.651 --> 43:32.403
Ohh! My man!

43:33.612 --> 43:35.239
Feeding on a transient's blood?

43:35.406 --> 43:37.032
It's the medical equivalent

43:37.199 --> 43:39.201
of drinking a glass of water
in the Ganges.

43:39.368 --> 43:41.620
I wasn't about to
go slumming for my supper.

43:41.787 --> 43:43.831
I fed on a man
so meticulously bland

43:43.998 --> 43:45.624
I figured it would be safe.

43:45.791 --> 43:47.584
Did you tidy up after yourself

43:47.751 --> 43:49.795
or will I be reading
about this in the paper?

43:49.962 --> 43:53.716
Don't worry. He's fine - the
proud owner of his first hickey.

43:55.634 --> 43:57.261
Goddammit, Johann,
what's wrong with me?

43:57.428 --> 43:59.471
You probably picked up a bug.

43:59.638 --> 44:03.559
Get some rest
and drink plenty of fluids.

44:03.726 --> 44:06.687
- That's it?
- That's it.

44:37.843 --> 44:39.678
Are you trying to poison me?

44:41.221 --> 44:43.974
Just plain old
everyday AB positive.

44:44.141 --> 44:47.227
What the fuck
am I supposed to eat?

44:47.394 --> 44:50.731
I...don't know.

44:50.898 --> 44:53.942
An upir having difficulty
tolerating blood...

44:54.943 --> 44:57.404
I'm certainly intrigued
by the novelty.

45:13.087 --> 45:14.797
Annie?

45:24.139 --> 45:27.851
I'm a mother
and a wife.

45:28.018 --> 45:32.773
Or I was...before.

45:32.940 --> 45:35.776
- We don't have to talk about it.
- No, I want to.

45:35.943 --> 45:38.946
I need to hear it
out loud sometimes.

45:41.990 --> 45:44.785
We were heading off
to Thanksgiving,

45:44.952 --> 45:47.704
my husband, my daughter and me.

45:48.705 --> 45:50.999
She was seven.

45:51.166 --> 45:52.960
Special occasions like that

45:53.127 --> 45:56.922
were the only time
she would let me do her hair.

45:57.089 --> 45:59.925
She looked so pretty.

46:00.926 --> 46:05.722
The truck hit,
flipped the car right over

46:05.889 --> 46:08.934
and I could see her braids
in the rear-view

46:09.101 --> 46:12.146
twist around and around.

46:13.313 --> 46:15.816
I should have died.

46:17.067 --> 46:20.404
In any rational world,
I would have.

46:22.364 --> 46:25.909
When everyone you know,
everyone you love,

46:26.076 --> 46:28.203
dies before you,

46:28.370 --> 46:30.664
how do you carry on?

46:49.266 --> 46:51.059
Roman.

46:52.144 --> 46:54.271
It's still here.

46:56.565 --> 46:59.485
Obviously, you did
a bad thing, right?

46:59.651 --> 47:02.613
But Pearl's poor choices today
clearly triggered some...

47:02.779 --> 47:05.741
..I don't know,
weird hormonal cascade in you.

47:05.908 --> 47:08.035
Corticotropin,
norepinephrine, vasopressin

47:08.202 --> 47:10.662
and, of course,
you know, adrenaline -

47:10.829 --> 47:13.957
the big daddy in your mammalian
fight-or-flight cocktail.

47:14.124 --> 47:18.086
So...I forgive you, alright?

47:19.838 --> 47:22.841
Plus,
I am in such a great mood.

47:23.008 --> 47:26.512
No point in holding
a grudge, right?

47:27.513 --> 47:31.099
Especially since
the garde Ã  l'eau is complete.

47:33.018 --> 47:37.606
Yeah, that's what we call
phase two in Babylonian.

47:37.773 --> 47:39.650
Come see for yourself.

47:39.816 --> 47:42.152
No...

47:42.319 --> 47:44.238
No, no!

47:44.404 --> 47:47.574
- Oh, hey. Don't be scared, huh?
- Stop!

47:47.741 --> 47:50.911
The future awaits.
No escaping the future.

47:51.078 --> 47:52.829
- Come on.
- No!

47:52.996 --> 47:54.748
Ohh...

47:54.915 --> 47:56.542
- Isn't that something?
- No!

47:56.708 --> 47:58.544
Huh? To everything,
there is a season.

47:58.710 --> 48:00.254
No!

48:00.420 --> 48:02.047
- Now it's our turn.
- Please, no!

48:02.214 --> 48:03.840
I couldn't have done it
without you, Miranda.

48:15.769 --> 48:17.813
Shelley?

48:26.738 --> 48:28.282
Shelley!

48:28.448 --> 48:30.993
I am not in the mood for games.

49:12.784 --> 49:14.202
Annie!

49:43.857 --> 49:45.400
Roman?

49:50.864 --> 49:52.491
What's wrong with him?

49:52.658 --> 49:54.618
He needs help.

49:55.305 --> 50:01.831
