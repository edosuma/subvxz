l've been
wanting to do something on my own,

05:42.055 --> 05:43.848

about the social aspects.

through the schools,

05:48.066 --> 05:49.941
because we weren't
emphasising space.

05:50.111 --> 05:52.070
Oh, l like that. Good idea.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.528
What about the space programme

05:59.086 --> 06:02.005

Russian and American programmes

06:02.174 --> 06:03.967

the tension of the space race.

06:04.136 --> 06:06.177

06:07.851 --> 06:09.761
What about that dog
the Russians sent up?

- What, Frasier?
- Well, it's just a teeny thing, Roz.

06:28.220 --> 06:32.518
l was thinking that seeing as how it is
the jumping-off place for the future,

06:32.687 --> 06:36.557
that we might devote two segments
to the lnternational Space Station.

very specifically.

Well, not to belittle your suggestion,
B.K., which l love.

07:21.313 --> 07:25.646
lt's just that that particular piece
of music has been a bit...

07:25.821 --> 07:28.825

07:30.204 --> 07:33.991
that perhaps an equally evocative,
less familiar piece of music

and deny other things.

And yet, we've seen things out there,
strange things.

This is my project and l asked you
not to try to take control,

19:07.308 --> 19:09.718
and now you've gone behind my back
and done just that.

19:09.896 --> 19:11.557
But you didn't even give me
a fair shake.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.811
lt was because
l was trying to protect myself

19:13.987 --> 19:16.314

so bossy sometimes.

19:16.492 --> 19:19.031
But we know what we saw out there
and we couldn't--

19:19.204 --> 19:21.532
We couldn't really say anything.

19:21.709 --> 19:23.334
And the bosses were scared of this.

19:23.503 --> 19:25.831
