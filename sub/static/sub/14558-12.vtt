WEBVTT

00:12.146 --> 00:14.014
* Love is a burning thing

00:16.517 --> 00:19.653
* And it makes a fiery ring

00:24.358 --> 00:27.728
* Bound by wild desire

00:30.598 --> 00:34.235
* I fell into a ring of fire

00:34.268 --> 00:38.706
* I fell into
a burning ring of fire *

00:38.739 --> 00:44.112
* I went down, down, down,
and the flames went higher *

00:44.145 --> 00:49.150
* And it burns, burns, burns,
the ring of fire *

00:49.183 --> 00:51.552
* The ring of fire...

00:55.223 --> 00:56.357
Morning.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.526
Hey, so we're going
to be back

00:58.559 --> 00:59.860
sometime Sunday night.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.462
In time for dinner?

01:01.495 --> 01:03.597
Well, it's a math
conference at Stanford.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.367
So chances are we may
be a little late getting back.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.868
We?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.671
Amita and I, yeah,
we're driving together.

01:10.704 --> 01:14.208
Oh, a romantic weekend
away, huh?

01:14.242 --> 01:16.210
We will be driving
through wine country.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.779
Well, you know what they say?

01:18.812 --> 01:20.881
Central California has some
lovely cabernets.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.616
See ya, kid.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.286
* The ring of fire

01:25.319 --> 01:30.491
* The taste of love
is sweet... *

01:30.524 --> 01:33.161
(hip-hop playing)

01:41.302 --> 01:42.703
Hyah! Get out!

01:42.736 --> 01:44.638
Get!

01:44.672 --> 01:46.174
Lady? Lady?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.876
Lady?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.357
FBI?

02:03.391 --> 02:04.458
Yeah, how you doing?

02:04.492 --> 02:06.694
Rachel Willons, California
Bureau of Investigation.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.396
- Don Eppes.
- Colby Granger.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.563
Abner Stone
did this.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.731
Did what?

02:10.764 --> 02:12.533
Kidnapped the girl
and beat her.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.468
Abner Stone from
the polygamy cult?

02:14.502 --> 02:15.536
He's one of
the fugitives

02:15.569 --> 02:16.770
on your ten most
wanted list.

02:16.804 --> 02:17.938
He assaulted
her last night.

02:17.971 --> 02:18.939
I've got roadblocks
going...

02:18.972 --> 02:20.808
Hold on, how do you know
he did it?

02:20.841 --> 02:21.809
She told me.

02:21.842 --> 02:22.910
We were told
she was dead.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.413
No, the guy that found her
was afraid to touch her,

02:25.446 --> 02:26.514
thought she was dead.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.581
She was just
unconscious.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.682
Okay, where is he?

02:28.716 --> 02:30.784
Uh, local PD.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.853
All right.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.488
DON: This is her up here?
- Yeah.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.923
Josephine Kirtland.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.425
Hi, Josephine.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.293
Can you tell me
who did this to you?

02:39.327 --> 02:41.829
The Prophet.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.697
Abner Stone.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.566
How about where it happened?

02:45.599 --> 02:47.435
Um, in the desert.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.836
They fell asleep,
and I ran away.

02:48.869 --> 02:49.703
Oh, yeah?

02:49.737 --> 02:51.372
Did you have to run
for a long time?

02:51.405 --> 02:52.740
All night.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.874
Where? On this road over here?

02:53.907 --> 02:54.842
No...

02:54.875 --> 02:56.310
Through the mountain.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.345
Where, up here?

02:57.378 --> 02:58.546
- I don't know.
- All right.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.982
Okay, guys, thanks.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.285
This is where
they found her.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.619
Uh-huh.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.655
I mean, she couldn't have
walked more than, what,

03:07.688 --> 03:09.423
ten miles at most.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.758
I don't know,
it's hard to say.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.725
She's a tough kid.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.461
What do you got on Stone?

03:13.494 --> 03:14.995
Apostolic Saints,
fundamentalist polygamists.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.930
Abner Stone controls
the families,

03:16.964 --> 03:19.667
properties, monies and sex lives

03:19.700 --> 03:20.701
of his followers.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.735
If they defy him,

03:21.769 --> 03:22.870
they defy God.

03:22.903 --> 03:26.006
In which case, God, through
Abner, orders removals.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.941
Removals?
Exile.

03:27.975 --> 03:28.876
Or death.

03:28.909 --> 03:29.943
Right.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.379
He's been hiding in Canada.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.446
He's back
for a reason.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.481
Yeah, you know him pretty good?

03:33.514 --> 03:34.815
Yeah, I've been tracking him

03:34.848 --> 03:35.816
for about 12 years.

03:35.849 --> 03:36.950
What's going on

03:36.984 --> 03:37.918
with this little girl?

03:37.951 --> 03:39.620
Most likely?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.989
His 73rd wife.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.699
Yeah, I mean,
but the thing is,

03:51.732 --> 03:53.534
how do you think
Stone's getting cash?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.535
Don't know.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.737
DOJ's frozen his banking
and business interests,

03:56.770 --> 03:58.806
which are substantial,
$15 to $20 million.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.508
We have his church
under surveillance.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.909
Is there any
chatter about him?

04:01.942 --> 04:03.411
Nothing in my office.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.845
The U.S. Attorneys
can't get anything

04:04.878 --> 04:07.381
out of these people--
very secretive group.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.350
Good morning.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.385
Morning. Hey,
Meeks, welcome.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.887
Guys, meet Abner
John Stone,

04:13.921 --> 04:14.988
aka The Prophet.

04:15.022 --> 04:18.058
He is the leader of the ASC,
the Apostolic Saints.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.928
It's a polygamist group that was
started by his grandfather.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.397
- How many people into this guy?
- Over 2,000.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.932
They own the town of Lewisburg

04:24.965 --> 04:26.767
in Central California,
the fraud capital

04:26.800 --> 04:27.768
of the state.

04:27.801 --> 04:28.802
Local officials are members

04:28.836 --> 04:29.837
so we can't
touch them.

04:29.870 --> 04:30.838
None of these women

04:30.871 --> 04:31.839
are legally married,

04:31.872 --> 04:32.906
they're all single mothers.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.575
They go on welfare,
they have no private income,

04:34.608 --> 04:35.943
and the church owns
all the property.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.711
Right, they don't pay taxes
or anything like that.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.780
Oh, no, they call it
bleeding the beast.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.315
They wanna take the
American government down--

04:41.349 --> 04:43.817
ironic, since the
government supports them.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.787
In '99, Stone's father died and
the mantle passed to Abner.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.323
After his older brother expired
under suspicious circumstances.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.692
Nice. The guy kills
his own brother.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.427
Two members of his church
have been murdered

04:53.461 --> 04:55.929
since he's on
the run. Here.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.565
You know, Stone exhibits the
behavior

04:57.598 --> 04:58.966
of a Jim Jones
kind of psychopathy.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.968
He alienates all
the male competition.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.636
He steals women and children.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.838
He publicly humiliates
his dissenters.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.408
He destabilized an intensely
private community

05:07.441 --> 05:09.610
to the degree that some of
the exiled men brought suit

05:09.643 --> 05:10.978
to get their
families back,

05:11.011 --> 05:12.946
which is how we heard
what was going on.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.615
Oh, yeah, right,
rape of a child,

05:14.648 --> 05:15.849
conspiracy to commit rape.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.118
That would be
the communal marriages.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.753
He takes groups

05:19.787 --> 05:20.588
of underage girls

05:20.621 --> 05:22.089
and marries them
to full-grown men,

05:22.122 --> 05:23.056
dozens at a time.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.593
Claims the way to heaven
is marrying virgins--

05:25.626 --> 05:26.694
as many as possible.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.663
Yeah, well, here you go.
Number 73.

05:34.067 --> 05:39.873
He picked me up after school
and took me to a motel.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.142
COLBY: Was there anyone else
there?

05:42.175 --> 05:45.713
Um... three men
I... I didn't know.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.015
Did you see any guns?

05:48.048 --> 05:50.484
(monitor beeping)

05:50.518 --> 05:56.990
After he made me get married,
he told me to change clothes,

05:57.024 --> 05:59.460
so I climbed
out the window.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.896
I didn't want to go home
because he knows where we live,

06:02.930 --> 06:04.798
so I went to a friend's house.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.735
But he found me anyway,

06:07.768 --> 06:10.103
and took me to...

06:10.137 --> 06:13.674
a trailer in... in the desert.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.942
Who is your friend?

06:14.975 --> 06:16.644
Lee Brady.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.878
Okay.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.947
We're going to want
to talk to Lee,

06:19.980 --> 06:22.015
and do you remember
about how long the drive was

06:22.049 --> 06:24.051
to the trailer?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.887
Like, um...
an hour, maybe.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.623
Okay.
(phone ringing)

06:31.124 --> 06:32.593
Excuse me.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.728
This is Granger.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.498
Josephine?

06:38.699 --> 06:40.167
Did Prophet Stone force you

06:40.200 --> 06:41.769
to have sex with him?

06:48.008 --> 06:51.211
AMITA:
I, uh... burnt a mix

06:51.244 --> 06:52.846
for us to listen to on the way.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.047
Oh, yeah?
What kind...

06:54.081 --> 06:55.816
what kind of music
are we listening to?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.951
Cake, Coldplay, Travis,

06:57.985 --> 06:59.119
a couple indie bands.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.954
I put some Kinks on there--
my mom's a huge Kinks fan

07:00.988 --> 07:02.089
so I know all the words.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.658
Oh, cool. Nice.

07:04.692 --> 07:09.062
(acoustic rock music playing)

07:09.096 --> 07:10.798
What?
No. Nothing.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.099
(turns off music)

07:12.132 --> 07:14.468
- It's not nothing. What?
- I'm sorry.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.936
Can we just put
on something else?

07:15.969 --> 07:19.239
Just... or maybe
let's drive quietly.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.209
Quiet for five hours?

07:22.242 --> 07:23.176
Yeah.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.113
We don't have to.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.715
- No.
- No, we don't have to.

07:27.748 --> 07:28.716
Just put the Kinks back on.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.117
That wasn't the Kinks.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.152
(phone ringing)

07:32.185 --> 07:33.153
Hello.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.154
DON:
Hey, where are you?

07:34.187 --> 07:35.589
Uh... I'm in the car

07:35.623 --> 07:36.690
with Amita.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.992
We're on our way to a math
conference at Stanford.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.260
Yeah? Look,
I need some help here.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.862
Okay. What's up?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.263
Well, we got
these satellite photos.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.999
We're trying to find
a trailer home in the desert.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.901
We got some coordinates,
but I think

07:47.935 --> 07:49.737
the problem is
the area is too large.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.639
Okay, so you are linked to JPL?

07:51.672 --> 07:52.706
Yeah, yeah. Hold on.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.642
I'm going to put you
on speakerphone, all right?

07:54.675 --> 07:55.976
All right, go ahead.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.511
All right,
tell us what you know.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.746
All right, well,

07:58.779 --> 08:00.247
I mean, this guy grabbed a girl

08:00.280 --> 08:01.615
from a home in Bakersfield.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.850
All right,
you know what?

08:02.883 --> 08:04.918
Give me GPS readings
for the house

08:04.952 --> 08:07.655
and as well as for where
the victim was found.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.257
Okay. 35.334 latitude.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.291
I got it.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.728
Negative 119.020 longitude.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.996
He drove for about an hour

08:16.029 --> 08:17.631
to a trailer in the desert
where he

08:17.665 --> 08:19.032
attacked the victim,
who then escaped.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.569
She walked all night
to Highway 14,

08:21.602 --> 08:24.304
35.133, negative

08:24.337 --> 08:25.873
- 118.955.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.808
You see? I mean, that's the
thing.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.942
We're dealing with,
you know,

08:28.976 --> 08:31.645
2,200 square miles
of mountain desert.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.213
How rough was
the terrain?

08:33.246 --> 08:35.315
I mean, did she
cross a road?

08:35.348 --> 08:37.084
Did she follow a road?

08:37.117 --> 08:38.652
Did she have gear?

08:38.686 --> 08:40.654
She didn't have any gear.
She had a sprained ankle.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.657
Um... what? It was
at night. It was a...

08:43.691 --> 08:45.559
a mountain, not a road.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.761
Yeah, because the rougher
the terrain, the more likely

08:47.795 --> 08:50.664
she was forced into
levi-flight type movement.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.065
Yeah, see, I can create
a viable search pattern,

08:52.099 --> 08:53.066
but we're going to need bounds

08:53.100 --> 08:54.902
so that
certain areas have

08:54.935 --> 08:56.336
higher values
than others.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.071
You know, for example,
we're looking for a trailer.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.807
Well, that's probably going
to be near a road.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.308
Now, how was the weather?

09:01.341 --> 09:03.210
The weather was clear. I still
don't see what we're doing.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.212
It's like when
you lose your keys.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.981
You don't methodically search
every inch of your house

09:08.015 --> 09:09.349
from front to back.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.550
You look like crazy
in one area,

09:10.584 --> 09:13.086
and then jump
to the next-most-likely area

09:13.120 --> 09:14.187
and look there.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.123
All right, Donny,
I've got...

09:16.156 --> 09:18.726
I've got a really good
bounding set for you here.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.360
All right, go ahead.
Give me it.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.130
Search sectors 78, 79,

09:23.163 --> 09:25.599
86, 87,

09:25.633 --> 09:28.068
91 and 92, and then

09:28.101 --> 09:30.137
rapidly scan the areas between.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.839
Okay, got it.
Hey, thanks, buddy.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.073
I'll call you later, all right?

09:33.106 --> 09:35.008
Roger that, Don.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.109
10-4.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.978
Yeah.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.947
Do you...
do you want to turn around?

09:39.980 --> 09:40.681
No, no.
You sure?

09:40.714 --> 09:42.983
They're gonna
find this guy.

09:43.016 --> 09:46.987
I hear there's some really
nice Central Coast wines.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.922
Maybe we should try one
with dinner tonight.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.992
Mm. Sounds good.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.827
MEGAN:
No sign of Stone's trailer

09:53.861 --> 09:54.862
in Sector 87.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.697
All right, so next?

09:56.730 --> 09:59.166
Leaping over
to Sector 91.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.368
Okay, what is Stone
looking for down here

10:01.401 --> 10:02.402
that he can't
get in Canada?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.905
Something to do with
the community here, right?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.173
Maybe.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.109
Hey, wait a minute,
actually, go back.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.979
Here, can you bring
this 91 to full screen?

10:12.012 --> 10:14.147
(beeping)

10:14.181 --> 10:15.148
All right, go tighter.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.784
Yeah, tighter.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.019
Closer.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.721
Oh, yeah, that's
got to be it, right?

10:23.791 --> 10:25.092
All right, great, I'm on my way.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.193
Oh, and listen, Don,

10:26.226 --> 10:27.995
the girl said the bodyguards
are armed, all right.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.196
They found
Abner Stone's hideout.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.263
I'll ride with you.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.300
I'm looking for my daughter,
Josephine Kirtland.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.169
Excuse me,
Emmanueline Kirtland?

10:36.203 --> 10:38.038
I'm Rachel Willons, California
Bureau of Investigation.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.272
I'll take you
to your daughter.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.974
Thank you.
I'll catch up with you.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.210
Is she all right?

10:43.243 --> 10:45.312
She's a little beat up,
but she'll be okay.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.379
This way.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.786
You live in Lewisburg,
Emmanueline?

10:52.820 --> 10:55.022
No, my husband moved us
out three years ago.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.456
We live in
Bakersfield now.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.191
Well, but you're still
Apostolic Saints?

10:58.225 --> 11:00.427
You still believe
in Prophet Stone?

11:02.495 --> 11:04.231
Where is your husband?

11:06.299 --> 11:08.335
He was killed last year.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.038
I see.

11:11.071 --> 11:14.341
Did you know Prophet Stone
wanted Josephine for a wife?

11:14.374 --> 11:17.210
That's why we were
exiled from Lewisburg.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.413
My husband didn't want
Josephine to marry Abner.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.448
The Prophet's had his eye

11:21.481 --> 11:22.349
on her for a while.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.383
But now your husband's gone,

11:23.416 --> 11:25.285
and Abner came to talk to you
about Josephine?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.221
Did you send her to that motel?

11:28.255 --> 11:29.723
JOSEPHINE:
Mom.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.464
I didn't know he would beat her.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.132
But you were willing
to let her marry him.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.269
Oh, my God.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.972
You told him where to find me?

11:45.005 --> 11:48.742
It's an honor to be
the Prophet's wife.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.949
He raped me.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.821
(over radio):
...you're clear to move in.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.122
MAN:
Roger that.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.523
We're aproximately ten meters
from the trailer.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.192
No visual, yet.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.265
Containment three,
you in position?

12:12.299 --> 12:15.302
Roger that, we're in position.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.540
All right, let's do this.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.009
Copy that, Agent Granger.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.882
Containment three,
you see anything?

12:28.916 --> 12:30.117
We got nothing.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.320
No movement in
the containment zone.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.228
All right, stand down,
it's a trap.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.830
We got to sweep
this place, guys.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.302
They left in a hurry.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.171
Probably raced out of
here as soon as

12:51.204 --> 12:52.405
they realized
Josephine was gone.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.441
They had her tied up
in the bedroom.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.409
That must have been
where the beating took place.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.011
Wait, what's this?

13:00.513 --> 13:02.916
Some kind of diagram?

13:02.950 --> 13:04.351
A map, maybe?

13:06.186 --> 13:08.021
What is this guy planning?

13:19.867 --> 13:22.369
CHARLIE: Uh, we're really not
that far from the crime scene.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.971
No, it's okay.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.605
I'm curious about the chart
that Don mentioned.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.207
Yeah, me, too, and
you know, it's okay

13:27.240 --> 13:28.441
if we miss that cocktail
reception tonight,

13:28.475 --> 13:30.010
'cause that's just
a lot of schmoozing.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.912
The conference doesn't
start till the morning.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.981
The only thing is, we're gonna
have to drive all night.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.883
You can sleep, I'll drive.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.550
And listen to The
Kinks the whole time?

13:37.584 --> 13:40.187
Maybe.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.555
(both laughing)

13:42.589 --> 13:43.523
(elevator dings)

13:48.395 --> 13:50.330
Emmanueline, does this
mean anything to you?

13:53.533 --> 13:54.467
Why did you tell Abner Stone

13:54.501 --> 13:57.304
how to find Josephine
after she ran away?

13:57.337 --> 14:01.108
Since we've been in Bakersfield,
she's too much of the world.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.375
She's 14,

14:02.409 --> 14:05.145
and you gave her
to a man in his 40s.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.115
I was trying to save
her eternal soul.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.582
How did he get
in touch with you?

14:09.616 --> 14:11.384
Came to the house.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.053
He knows where
all his believers are.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.454
With three men?
What were they driving?

14:14.487 --> 14:18.391
It was a big, silver...

14:18.425 --> 14:19.492
It was big.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.627
- An SUV?
- I don't know

14:20.660 --> 14:22.329
what you call it, it was
like a truck, but closed up.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.663
Okay, where were they headed?

14:23.696 --> 14:24.998
The new city,
I guess.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.499
He needs her
'cause she's pure breed.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.600
And what does that mean?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.102
Well, the Kirtlands

14:29.136 --> 14:31.271
go back to Indiana,

14:31.304 --> 14:33.907
before Abner's grandfather
came out West.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.276
We're from the original line
of Apostolic Saints.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.545
No!

14:41.381 --> 14:42.582
Stop it.
You can't control me.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.217
You will not talk
to that boy.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.086
Hey, hey,
wait a minute.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.620
I can talk to whoever I want.
I'm not like you.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.090
Do you want to go to hell?
Is that what you want?

14:50.123 --> 14:52.292
Listen, you have to calm
down or I can take her

14:52.325 --> 14:53.660
from your custody.
Do you understand me?

14:56.163 --> 14:57.397
Who were you talking to,
Josephine?

14:57.430 --> 14:58.398
That boy, Lee Brady.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.300
- I forbid you.
- I don't have to listen to you.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.102
You handed me over to get raped.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.537
Josephine, it's a spiritual
marriage. He's God's chosen.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.039
You're insane.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.208
Emmanueline,
listen to me.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.211
Please let me take you to
talk to someone to help you--

15:11.244 --> 15:13.713
women who have been plural wives
who have gotten out of it.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.283
God has given me signs.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.251
What signs?

15:18.285 --> 15:20.453
The Prophet is taking us back.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.955
We're coming home from exile.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.057
And the price of admission
is Josephine?

15:24.091 --> 15:25.158
Listen, I know

15:25.192 --> 15:27.260
that you are scared because
this is the only life

15:27.294 --> 15:29.462
that you have known,
but there is another way,

15:29.496 --> 15:31.498
a better way to lead
a spiritual life.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.601
Temptation comes in many guises.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.037
I'll be back in the morning
for my child.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.440
(sighing)

15:43.576 --> 15:46.013
AMITA:
The characters are odd.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.380
Like letters
of an archaic language.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.517
It looks a little
like Hebrew, but not quite.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.552
These people are
fundamentalists?

15:52.585 --> 15:54.354
Oh yeah, Old Testament style.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.023
Could this chart have
something to do with the Bible?

15:56.056 --> 15:56.589
Did you see this?

15:56.623 --> 15:59.426
Pennies for the Prophet?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.061
Yeah, this guy wants
to found

16:01.094 --> 16:04.197
a new city where the saints
can live in purity.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.766
This guy's asking
for people's pennies,

16:06.799 --> 16:09.002
meanwhile, he's a
multimillionaire.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.770
Talk of purity
always disturbs me.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.139
Genocides in Rwanda,

16:12.172 --> 16:14.541
Bosnia, the ethnic
cleansing...

16:14.574 --> 16:16.343
Why do evil people

16:16.376 --> 16:18.245
always seem to be hell-bent

16:18.278 --> 16:19.446
on purity?

16:19.479 --> 16:23.516
This pattern seems to be very
important to these people.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.653
It seems mathematical.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.321
It's rudimentary,
but, uh,

16:28.355 --> 16:31.091
I think maybe...

16:31.124 --> 16:34.027
Yeah, let's blow off the
conference and work on this.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.298
Emmanueline Kirtland said he was
traveling in a silver SUV,

16:38.331 --> 16:40.033
at least she thought
it was an SUV.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.302
She's been so sheltered, she
doesn't know what to call it.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.104
Well, we'll put the
description out.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.472
And Stone's picture to law
enforcement agencies

16:45.505 --> 16:46.673
and all media.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.142
We're even faxing it to gas
stations from Mexico to Canada.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.343
He got through
the roadblocks?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.612
Well, anything is possible,
but we don't think they realized

16:52.645 --> 16:55.082
the girl was missing till they
woke up in the morning,

16:55.115 --> 16:57.217
and we already had the area
closed in by then.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.418
So why can't we
find them?

16:58.451 --> 17:01.354
Well, he knows where all the
believers live, they revere him,

17:01.388 --> 17:03.423
and they're all practiced liars.
They call it lying for the Lord.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.592
But he's aware we're after
him-- isn't he too smart

17:05.625 --> 17:07.327
to roll up to the house
of one of his followers?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.362
Yeah, but he's driven
by a malignant narcissism.

17:09.396 --> 17:12.065
He needs to be around people
that treat him like a god.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.766
He's also a sex predator,
searching for prey.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.468
Well, we need to track down
and interview

17:15.502 --> 17:17.737
every Apostolic Saint
member in L.A. County.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.805
How many is that?

17:18.838 --> 17:20.373
Uh, 50-60, maybe.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.575
All right, let's get to it.
You want to take there?

17:22.609 --> 17:23.543
Yeah, thanks.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.682
It grew on me, it grew on me.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.717
Ow! Uh...

17:30.750 --> 17:34.087
Hi, I didn't expect you back.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.156
Yeah, well, we got
diverted by Don's case.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.457
Hello, there.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.458
Hi, Dr. Finch.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.859
Mildred.

17:39.892 --> 17:40.793
Please, call me Millie.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.762
I don't know what my mother
was thinking

17:42.795 --> 17:44.364
when she named me Mildred.
It's horrible.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.466
I don't look like
a Mildred.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.202
It's my grandmother,
who's great, but I just...

17:49.236 --> 17:50.637
I know that I'm your boss.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.804
But if we could all

17:51.838 --> 17:54.174
just be friends,
wouldn't that be great?

17:54.207 --> 17:57.410
I was just about to open another
bottle of cabernet.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.511
You want to join us?

17:58.545 --> 18:01.281
No, thanks, thank you.
We have work to do on the case.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.516
AMITA:
Calabi-Yau manifold.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.119
Yes, I was explaining
string theory to Alan.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.320
He's very smart.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.721
Wouldn't that make
a beautiful sculpture

18:08.755 --> 18:10.357
- in front of a building?
- How cool is this?

18:10.390 --> 18:11.558
MILLIE:
Indeed.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.693
Where's the ladies' room?

18:13.726 --> 18:14.794
Oh, right this way.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.895
You know, your father

18:15.928 --> 18:18.165
wants to understand what we do.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.299
Did you know that?

18:19.332 --> 18:20.600
Well.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.335
I just said that
to get her going.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.636
She's really rather amusing.

18:23.670 --> 18:24.871
Dad, are you dating Mildred?

18:24.904 --> 18:26.773
No, I don't do that.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.541
We were having dinner.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.543
You know, got to eat.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.913
Hey, uh, about this
string theory stuff.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.914
I think it's bogus.

18:34.947 --> 18:35.915
Oh, come on.

18:35.948 --> 18:36.883
It took you all
40 years

18:36.916 --> 18:39.452
to get back to what
we were talking about

18:39.486 --> 18:41.254
in the '60s--
you know, vibrations.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.723
Well, Dad, what's important is
what actually vibrates--

18:43.756 --> 18:45.492
straight pieces, closed rings,
little surfaces.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.827
Oh, come on, face it.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.896
We're talking about vibes.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.131
Oh, boy.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.536
Oh, come on,
he's just having fun.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.570
Yeah.

19:01.941 --> 19:06.213
Okay, we have seven men
and 23 women and 30 children,

19:06.246 --> 19:08.348
who are members or ex-members
of Stone's church in L.A.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.649
WILLONS: Seven men--
that means basically

19:09.682 --> 19:10.917
we have seven families
to interview.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.586
Let's get agents to sit on each
location until we can get there.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.522
(phone ringing)
Rachel Willons.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.624
Whoa, whoa, slow down,
Josephine.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.791
I thought you were
at the hospital.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.929
Okay, okay, listen,
stay put.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.897
Don't move. I am coming.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.098
What happened?

19:26.132 --> 19:27.800
Josephine skipped out of the
hospital with her boyfriend.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.469
She went home to get her clothes
and found blood.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.470
Her mother's missing.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.571
She thinks Abner took her.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.607
All right, let's go.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.515
MEGAN:
Why do you say

19:42.549 --> 19:44.451
that Abner Stone took
your mother?

19:44.484 --> 19:45.585
Who else?

19:45.618 --> 19:47.520
She doesn't know anybody here.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.422
She barely even
leaves the house.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.858
MEGAN:
But why would he take her?

19:51.891 --> 19:53.893
He's crazy.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.528
And so is she.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.897
She might have just
gone with him.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.800
Well, we have all that blood.
Remember?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.001
Um...

20:02.034 --> 20:04.604
In the kitchen?

20:07.774 --> 20:11.010
Why did you leave the hospital?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.479
What?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.747
You and your boyfriend
left the hospital,

20:14.781 --> 20:16.316
and now your mother's missing.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.785
Josephine, did you do something

20:18.818 --> 20:20.019
to hurt your mother?

20:20.052 --> 20:20.753
No.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.389
No. I want my mom

20:22.422 --> 20:24.557
off my back;
I want her to get help.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.359
I don't...
I don't want her dead.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.261
But why did you
sneak away, then?

20:28.295 --> 20:30.029
(exhales):
You don't understand.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.700
Ever since my dad died,
my mom's like a zombie.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.569
I pick up our food stamps
and welfare checks.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.371
I do the shopping,
I pay the bills.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.508
All she does is tell me
I'm going to hell

20:41.541 --> 20:43.376
and then hands me over
to a pervert.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.545
Okay, I understand
that you're angry,

20:45.578 --> 20:47.547
but you're not answering
my question.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.915
Why did you
and your boyfriend...

20:48.948 --> 20:50.617
Me and Lee were gonna
run away together.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.355
WILLONS: Lee, your story doesn't
make any sense to me.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.524
- What were you two doing there?
- We were just going back

20:57.557 --> 20:58.891
to her house
to get some clothes.

20:58.925 --> 20:59.992
Where are your
parents, Lee?

21:00.026 --> 21:01.394
LEE:
I got no parents.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.462
What does that mean?

21:02.495 --> 21:03.963
They live in Lewisburg;
I live here.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.698
So the Prophet
kicked you out?

21:05.732 --> 21:08.301
He kicks out a lot of boys.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.469
And where do you live now?

21:09.502 --> 21:11.070
One of the older guys

21:11.103 --> 21:12.939
has a studio apartment
in Bakersfield.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.341
He lets me stay sometime.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.376
And what happens when
he doesn't let you stay?

21:18.110 --> 21:21.514
You on the streets, Lee?

21:25.352 --> 21:27.687
So you killed
Josephine's mother,

21:27.720 --> 21:29.389
and the two of you stay in their
place.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.857
No way, no, after we left the
hospital...

21:30.890 --> 21:32.992
We have you on a hospital
security tape, Lee.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.694
We see you leaving at 8:35,

21:34.727 --> 21:36.463
and you didn't call us till 45
minutes later--

21:36.496 --> 21:37.564
enough time for you to go...

21:37.597 --> 21:38.998
No! We stopped for a burger!

21:39.031 --> 21:40.533
We can check that,
too, Lee.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.436
No! I got the receipt.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.638
Look, it's even got
the time on it.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.109
(sighs)

21:50.142 --> 21:52.545
We didn't hurt anybody.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.720
None of this is random--
there must be...

22:00.753 --> 22:02.655
there must be some sort
of system here.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.658
Yeah, but there are
discrepancies between your paper

22:05.692 --> 22:07.927
and my quilt-- see,
these lines are missing.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.497
Well, I think he's
reconstructing it, you know?

22:10.530 --> 22:11.864
He's adjusting it.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.600
(knocking)
Sorry, just wanted

22:13.633 --> 22:14.601
to say good night.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.002
Leaving?
Yeah.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.870
Why are you working
on cattle breeding?

22:17.904 --> 22:19.606
Cattle breeding?

22:19.639 --> 22:20.773
Oh, right,

22:20.807 --> 22:21.874
I'm not supposed to know.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.511
Very classified FBI dairy farm
information, right?

22:24.544 --> 22:26.479
Shh. Never mind.

22:26.513 --> 22:27.914
Millie, what are you talking
about?

22:27.947 --> 22:29.015
No, believe me, mum's the word,
I didn't see a thing, okay?

22:29.048 --> 22:31.484
Mildred, Mil...

22:31.518 --> 22:32.452
Millie.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.854
What does this...

22:34.887 --> 22:36.689
network mean to you?

22:36.723 --> 22:39.492
It's an inbreeding chart.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.927
Genealogy.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.895
I can decode that.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.564
It's a reticulated tree.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.798
You know, breeders select

22:45.832 --> 22:46.899
for certain traits--
you know,

22:46.933 --> 22:48.034
if it's, uh,

22:48.067 --> 22:49.636
better milkers,
more offspring.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.171
Well, it doesn't look
like a normal family tree

22:52.204 --> 22:53.673
because of inbreeding.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.509
So if Abner Stone

22:56.543 --> 22:58.678
was a descendant of the man
who founded this religion,

22:58.711 --> 23:00.713
then this is his family tree.

23:00.747 --> 23:03.850
MILLIE: Religion? I thought
we're talking farm animals.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.051
CHARLIE:
See, his hand-drawn genealogy

23:05.084 --> 23:07.086
differs from the one
on the quilt.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.788
AMITA:
Yeah. The Aramaic letters

23:08.821 --> 23:12.659
represent important males, and
the cross stitching is females.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.527
MILLIE:
Okay, for example,

23:14.561 --> 23:16.729
this guy married
his brother's...

23:16.763 --> 23:19.065
third wife's...

23:19.098 --> 23:21.100
second daughter. Ugh!

23:21.133 --> 23:22.802
Well...

23:22.835 --> 23:25.071
this must be Stone here.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.973
Well, this man has
dozens of wives

23:27.006 --> 23:28.808
but very few children--
which means...?

23:28.841 --> 23:30.443
A genetic problem, maybe.

23:30.477 --> 23:32.011
Inbreeding works great
in cows,

23:32.044 --> 23:33.880
not so good in people.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.549
You know, we can determine
his inbreeding coefficient.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.818
- Inbreeding coefficient?
- Yeah, how inbred

23:38.851 --> 23:41.053
one person is compared
to the general population.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.154
Wright's equation.

23:42.188 --> 23:44.223
- Wright's equation?
CHARLIE: Yeah, Sewell Wright,

23:44.256 --> 23:46.092
the-the University of
Chicago mathematician.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.727
The evolutionary geneticist.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.496
MILLIE:
That's right-- worked for

23:49.529 --> 23:50.630
the Department of Agriculture.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.567
(laughs):
Yeah, this bull's got problems.

23:54.601 --> 23:55.702
CHARLIE:
So Abner Stone

23:55.735 --> 23:57.570
has a 42%
inbreeding coefficient.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.706
Well, I assume that
that's fairly high.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.574
MILLIE: Yeah, I mean, regular
population has,

24:01.608 --> 24:02.875
like, .1 or .2 percent.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.844
CHARLIE: Well, then it's no
wonder he's had

24:04.877 --> 24:07.046
no viable offspring,
because so many of his genes

24:07.079 --> 24:09.248
- carry recessive alleles.
- Well, let's put it this way--

24:09.281 --> 24:11.484
if Stone were
a stud on a farm,

24:11.518 --> 24:13.653
we'd be having steak
for dinner.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.855
Unless... he crosses
with a non-inbred female.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.090
Well, that's why
he needed Josephine.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.693
Because even though
she's a pureblood...

24:20.727 --> 24:23.530
she doesn't carry
the recessive genes.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.197
Right, but she's
out of reach now, so...

24:29.301 --> 24:31.938
Josephine has a sister,

24:31.971 --> 24:35.875
and that's who he wants next.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.144
JOSEPHINE:
I have lots of sisters.

24:38.177 --> 24:41.013
Not full sisters.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.182
JOSEPHINE: When we were
exiled, my mom was

24:43.215 --> 24:44.884
the only wife my dad took.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.152
The rest stayed in Lewisburg.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.954
So you have half sisters there.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.622
Lots.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.023
Are you gonna find my mom?

24:51.057 --> 24:52.224
He took her,

24:52.258 --> 24:53.292
I know he did.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.928
Why would he take her,
Josephine?

24:55.962 --> 24:57.229
'Cause he takes everything.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.833
(knocking at door)

25:00.867 --> 25:01.834
Excuse me.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.173
MEGAN: These kids didn't do
anything, except try

25:07.206 --> 25:08.808
and run away together.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.276
Josephine could have a sister
here

25:10.309 --> 25:11.811
that she doesn't know anything
about.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.713
Outside of Lewisburg?

25:13.746 --> 25:15.582
These women are expected
to produce one child a year.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.249
Emmanueline has no will--
she would breed with

25:17.283 --> 25:18.685
whomever they told her to.

25:18.718 --> 25:19.852
COLBY:
Stone's fingerprints,

25:19.886 --> 25:21.153
all over Emmanueline's kitchen.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.922
Okay, so Stone
kidnapped Emmanueline

25:22.955 --> 25:25.324
so she'd take him
to another daughter?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.193
Someone... younger
than Josephine?

25:27.226 --> 25:29.729
I don't know, I mean,
would she do that?

25:29.762 --> 25:31.263
When he rewrites
his genealogy,

25:31.297 --> 25:33.065
he's saying who
goes to Heaven.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.067
That's pretty powerful
incentive for Emmanueline.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.303
So we could be talking
about a little girl

25:37.336 --> 25:40.573
who he's gonna take and then
groom to be his wife?

25:40.607 --> 25:43.075
These men have married girls
as young as nine.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.077
COLBY: And he's running out of
options, because

25:45.111 --> 25:47.680
we have his followers tied up
and we're closing in on him.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.949
If he has to get
a Kirtland girl, that means

25:49.982 --> 25:51.618
he's definitely
still in the area.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.085
Let's wake up
the seven families.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.354
AMITA:
This can't be right.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.591
Well, you're decoding
the Kirtland line, right?

25:58.625 --> 25:59.959
(sighs):
Charlie.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.360
What?

26:01.393 --> 26:02.795
Emmanueline Kirtland.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.196
Yeah, Josephine's mother?

26:04.230 --> 26:06.165
She's also
Josephine's sister.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.674
They have the same father.

26:18.310 --> 26:22.081
(siren wailing)

26:26.986 --> 26:29.656
(garbled radio transmission)

26:29.689 --> 26:31.123
(switches off siren)

26:31.157 --> 26:35.061
This is 1932 requesting
unit backup for a felony stop.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.229
DISPATCHER: Roger that, 1932.
Backup en route.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.332
Sorry, Officer.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.968
What's the problem?
Was I going too fast?

26:42.001 --> 26:42.935
Get back in the vehicle, sir.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.236
My wife kicked me out--
I shouldn't have been

26:44.270 --> 26:45.371
going so fast.

26:45.404 --> 26:46.973
Stop right there.
Get back in the vehicle.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.374
Be a sport, all right?

26:48.407 --> 26:49.776
Put your hands on the truck.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.178
I wasn't doing
anything.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.212
Don't move.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.347
Is there a problem?

26:55.381 --> 26:57.684
Hey, get back in the vehicle.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.019
William, apologize
to the police officer.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.889
(gunshots)
(screaming)

27:02.922 --> 27:06.959
(gasping, screaming)

27:06.993 --> 27:08.094
(gasp)

27:25.344 --> 27:26.946
His megalomania
is increasing.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.849
He's becoming more dangerous.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.784
But he's gonna make mistakes,
he's gonna make mistakes.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.853
He never attacked anyone
outside the cult?

27:33.886 --> 27:34.787
No, he's definitely

27:34.821 --> 27:36.923
becoming disinhibited--
but let me tell you,

27:36.956 --> 27:39.225
Abner's always been on this
path.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.360
How do you know him?

27:42.461 --> 27:44.296
I grew up with him.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.898
I was married
to an ASC elder

27:45.932 --> 27:48.367
when I was 13
and the old man was in his 60s.

27:50.202 --> 27:52.304
I got out when he died--
I was 19.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.339
I'm sorry.

27:53.372 --> 27:54.707
Oh, I'm not.

27:54.741 --> 27:55.975
I'm sorry for Emmanueline.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.443
You know,
the cult is bad enough.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.411
They raise girls for
breeding-- that's it.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.980
There's no skills,
no education,

28:01.013 --> 28:04.183
and the threat of eternal
damnation if they rebel.

28:04.216 --> 28:06.318
But Emmanueline, she's in
the hands of a psychopath.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.220
Hold on a second,
let me ask you this--

28:08.254 --> 28:09.922
what do you think
he's gonna do next?

28:09.956 --> 28:11.891
I mean, try to get through
roadblocks into Canada or...

28:11.924 --> 28:13.893
Well, that would be rational,
but I think he wants a showdown.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.394
And that we have
to be afraid of.

28:15.427 --> 28:16.462
Yeah? Why's that?

28:16.495 --> 28:18.430
Abner came to get
a Kirtland girl-- okay, maybe.

28:18.464 --> 28:19.565
But you know what I think?

28:19.598 --> 28:21.801
I think that he's afraid
of losing control of Lewisburg,

28:21.834 --> 28:23.102
being on the fringes.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.737
You think he'd really
go back there?

28:24.771 --> 28:26.472
I mean, he's got to know
we're all over the place.

28:26.505 --> 28:29.041
(sighs)

28:29.075 --> 28:30.342
I don't know.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.481
COLBY:
All right, thanks a lot.

28:35.514 --> 28:38.084
Okay, guys, as of 6:15 a.m.,

28:38.117 --> 28:40.953
Stone was headed north
on State Road 216.

28:40.987 --> 28:44.423
216. Okay, so let's
look at sector 167.

28:44.456 --> 28:47.026
Hey, did you
get anything

28:47.059 --> 28:48.360
from the families
you interviewed?

28:48.394 --> 28:50.863
No proof that
Stone's been to their homes,

28:50.897 --> 28:52.531
but I feel like
they know something.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.367
- Like where he's going?
- No. More like...

28:55.401 --> 28:58.537
what he plans to do for their
future-- but I don't know.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.106
CHARLIE:
Look, I can use any details

29:00.139 --> 29:01.507
you have to create
more bounds.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.409
Well, I brought in
the de facto leader.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.411
- Meeks is with him now.
- Let me know what you find out.

29:05.444 --> 29:09.148
Hey, has... has anyone talked
to Josephine about her mother?

29:09.181 --> 29:10.783
I'm going now.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.785
Charlie, I think he's
gonna have to steal

29:12.819 --> 29:14.854
another car, so he's probably
headed toward a town.

29:14.887 --> 29:17.556
All right, uh,
let's leap over

29:17.589 --> 29:19.358
to Sector 173, please.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.497
(indistinct conversation)

29:25.531 --> 29:27.834
Hey, guys. I brought
you some breakfast.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.101
Thanks.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.572
Did you find my mom?

29:33.605 --> 29:35.307
Um, not yet.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.343
How are you guys
doing in here?

29:37.376 --> 29:38.577
Is she okay?

29:38.610 --> 29:41.413
Uh, I have people...

29:41.447 --> 29:44.116
looking for her
all over the state.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.152
I, uh...

29:46.185 --> 29:47.319
What?

29:47.353 --> 29:48.454
What happened?
Is she okay?

29:48.487 --> 29:50.089
I-I don't know

29:50.122 --> 29:52.158
anything new
about your mom.

29:52.191 --> 29:55.194
I... I need to talk to you
about something else, though.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.229
We think that, um...

29:57.263 --> 29:58.865
That what?

29:58.898 --> 30:00.232
Just tell me.

30:01.968 --> 30:05.537
We think that your mom
is also your half sister.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.445
You didn't know that,

30:13.479 --> 30:15.281
did you?

30:18.617 --> 30:20.319
LEE: Jo, this is not our fault.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.254
We didn't pick
our parents.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.890
They're weird--
we are not like them.

30:26.625 --> 30:30.362
My dad is her dad, too?

30:30.396 --> 30:32.899
I'm sorry.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.137
Since we've been in Bakersfield,

30:38.170 --> 30:40.539
I've been going to
public school, and, um...

30:40.572 --> 30:42.508
Being normal.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.610
JOSEPHINE:
My mom can barely read.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.246
She's more
of a child than me.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.115
Well, does this
tell you anything

30:49.148 --> 30:50.349
about where he might

30:50.382 --> 30:51.450
have taken her?

30:54.420 --> 30:56.355
The new city.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.430
Where is this "new city"?

31:04.463 --> 31:05.497
Nobody knows but him.

31:05.531 --> 31:06.933
you?does he communicate with

31:06.966 --> 31:08.067
He doesn't.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.368
How can he be your leader
if he doesn't talk to you?

31:09.401 --> 31:10.502
He's being falsely accused

31:10.536 --> 31:12.571
by your corrupt,
ungodly government.

31:12.604 --> 31:15.374
Your prophet just shot and
killed a police officer.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.276
It's not a sin
to destroy the enemy

31:17.309 --> 31:18.444
that's set on destroying you.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.147
We have a duty to defend
our families and our beliefs.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.081
Which is what?

31:22.114 --> 31:24.116
Raping little girls
gets you to heaven?

31:24.150 --> 31:25.517
How many wives

31:25.551 --> 31:27.319
do you have, Mr. Jackson?

31:27.353 --> 31:29.521
How many of them
were underage

31:29.555 --> 31:31.323
the first time
you had sex with them?

31:31.357 --> 31:32.591
(knocking)
DON: Howard?

31:37.163 --> 31:39.198
DON:
All right, so,

31:39.231 --> 31:41.633
we found the SUV. It was
abandoned at a used car lot.

31:41.667 --> 31:42.801
Three cars were stolen.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.437
Got APBs on them, but what we
found was an MP3 player.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.339
So we know what kind
of music Stone likes.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.408
No, we know what kind of
podcasts the guy makes.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.210
Podcasting? That's
how he communicates

31:51.243 --> 31:52.278
with his followers.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.345
Charlie, let's hear it.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.614
Okay, so Stone records
a message on his computer,

31:55.647 --> 31:57.683
then uploads it
to a podcasting web site,

31:57.716 --> 31:58.650
and his followers use

31:58.684 --> 32:02.054
a unique identifier
to find it-- the name.

32:02.088 --> 32:03.322
(typing)

32:03.355 --> 32:05.691
And this. is the name

32:05.724 --> 32:07.359
of Abner Stone's podcasts.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.428
Okay, and no one can
find it without this code?

32:09.461 --> 32:11.297
Right, and from this,
we can not only hear

32:11.330 --> 32:13.432
what he's been saying...

32:13.465 --> 32:15.001
STONE:
For what you do in secret

32:15.034 --> 32:16.302
I will punish you openly.

32:16.335 --> 32:17.703
...but we can
backtrack to find out

32:17.736 --> 32:19.338
where he uploaded his rants.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.207
What, you mean through an ISP?

32:21.240 --> 32:23.642
No, to his physical address
in real time and space.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.077
Also get into
the ISP records.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.046
What good is that gonna
do us if he's gone?

32:27.079 --> 32:28.314
We can monitor
for his next podcast.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.748
No, no, no. We need
something faster.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.317
STONE: As they tear up the
kingdom of heaven,

32:31.350 --> 32:32.251
so shall they be torn.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.452
Well, look. I mean,

32:33.485 --> 32:34.720
if he's hidden there once,
maybe he'll hide there again.

32:34.753 --> 32:36.322
Hey, all right, we'll

32:36.355 --> 32:38.190
check it out, but the guy
stole three cars,

32:38.224 --> 32:39.358
all right?
I mean, he's trying

32:39.391 --> 32:40.726
to get through
roadblocks.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.361
STONE: ...doesn't fight back,
they shall be put

32:42.394 --> 32:44.130
to death on this earth.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.465
COLBY:
Aw, man.

32:46.498 --> 32:50.469
FBI sedans are not
made for this.

32:50.502 --> 32:53.705
Stone podcast from somewhere
back here last August.

32:53.739 --> 32:57.243
Well, looks like we're
about to run out of road.

32:57.276 --> 33:00.212
Here we go, here we go.

33:00.246 --> 33:03.215
STONE: I have blessed you and
blessed this place.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.217
The Lo has blessed you
and blessed this place.

33:05.251 --> 33:10.756
You shall gather with your wives
at 10578 Coyote Road,

33:10.789 --> 33:12.758
there to be blessed
and be saved...

33:12.791 --> 33:14.093
Don!

33:14.126 --> 33:15.361
On his latest podcast,

33:15.394 --> 33:17.229
Stone asked for his
followers to meet him.

33:17.263 --> 33:18.397
Where, in Canada?

33:18.430 --> 33:20.066
No, at the address
where he uploaded.

33:23.202 --> 33:24.270
Rachel, you see any vehicles?

33:24.303 --> 33:25.471
Nothing back here.

33:26.738 --> 33:27.606
Richardson?

33:27.639 --> 33:29.408
Granger, we got
tire tracks back here.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.311
(rapid gunfire)
(groaning)

33:32.344 --> 33:35.581
We got gunfire
at 10578 Coyote Road.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.816
Who's got a visual
on the shooter.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.751
Damn it! We got an agent down!
Agent down!

33:39.785 --> 33:43.089
(rapid gunfire)

33:43.122 --> 33:44.290
Rachel, are you okay?

33:44.323 --> 33:45.391
I'm good!

33:49.595 --> 33:51.797
We got an agent down,
multiple gunshots fired.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.533
We need backup
and a medic ASAP.

33:54.566 --> 33:55.634
(gunfire continues)

34:00.606 --> 34:04.376
(sirens wailing)

34:06.412 --> 34:08.180
All right, Colby, we're here.

34:08.214 --> 34:10.082
- Where is she?
- She's right between me

34:10.116 --> 34:11.617
and the house, in the middle
of the kill zone.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.352
DON: How many?
- Don't know.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.087
There's multiple shooters.
They have automatic weapons.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.256
All right, we're coming
to get you. Hang tight.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.125
Let's go guys. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.193
STONE:
What has happened

34:21.227 --> 34:22.861
to religious freedom
in this country?

34:22.894 --> 34:27.199
We are a private, peace-loving
group of Christians,

34:27.233 --> 34:29.268
attacked again
by an overreaching

34:29.301 --> 34:30.502
and paranoid government.

34:34.573 --> 34:37.409
We're forced to defend
ourselves and our beliefs.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.447
STONE:
We live according to the laws

34:41.480 --> 34:45.551
of God's Word--
Deuteronomy 21:15:

34:45.584 --> 34:46.885
"To the nation of the unclean...

34:46.918 --> 34:48.620
Is my mom
in there?

34:48.654 --> 34:50.156
Uh, I don't know.

34:50.189 --> 34:51.357
You guys are
supposed to be

34:51.390 --> 34:52.358
waiting inside for
the social worker.

34:52.391 --> 34:55.761
Listen, I have Abner Stone
on his cell phone

34:55.794 --> 34:57.463
from inside the farmhouse,
talking to the media.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.630
I need that
line cut off.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.632
"I will demolish
your high places."

35:00.666 --> 35:02.801
If I hadn't run away,
none of this would've happened.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.771
Hey.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.806
Listen to me: this
is not your fault.

35:07.839 --> 35:09.575
That man is sick,

35:09.608 --> 35:12.644
and you are not
responsible for any of this.

35:12.678 --> 35:15.381
STONE: "I will lay waste to your
cities, so your very enemies

35:15.414 --> 35:16.648
"who come to live there

35:16.682 --> 35:18.417
will stand aghast
at the sight of it."

35:18.450 --> 35:20.686
All right, PD, we're
about to move. Bring it on.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.521
(over radio): Copy that, Don.

35:22.554 --> 35:23.922
We'll lay down covering fire on
your motion.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.524
All right, let's go,
boys-- move! Straight!

35:26.892 --> 35:28.794
Prophet, here they come.

35:28.827 --> 35:29.861
(rapid gunfire)

35:29.895 --> 35:30.796
(bullets ricocheting)

35:33.465 --> 35:35.167
Tight! Tight, keep it tight!

35:36.635 --> 35:39.305
Go left! Go left! Left!

35:39.338 --> 35:40.138
Let's go! Let's go.

35:42.841 --> 35:43.809
You all right?
Yeah.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.478
Forward! Go!

35:46.512 --> 35:49.548
Left! Left!

35:49.581 --> 35:50.716
All right, hold!

35:50.749 --> 35:51.550
How you doing, Rachel?

35:51.583 --> 35:52.418
All right.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.253
(gunfire continues)

35:58.457 --> 35:58.957
Ready?

35:58.990 --> 35:59.891
Got it.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.927
All right, straight back.
Straight back!

36:04.263 --> 36:07.699
Nice and easy now.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.269
(over radio): The agents are
clear. The agents are clear.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.437
(over radio):
Repeat: The agents are clear.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.971
OFFICER (distant):
Agents clear!

36:13.004 --> 36:15.474
Hold your fire!

36:15.507 --> 36:17.476
DON (over P.A.):
Abner Stone!

36:17.509 --> 36:20.312
This is Agent Don Eppes
with the FBI!

36:20.346 --> 36:23.349
You are completely surrounded.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.284
We'd like to resolve
this peacefully.

36:29.555 --> 36:32.824
I'm going to send
a phone line out to you.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.760
- Come on.
- Shields up.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.462
OFFICER (over radio): All teams
look alive.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.364
Two agents moving in.
Stand by to cover.

36:38.397 --> 36:40.999
William...

36:41.032 --> 36:42.901
The Devil is running us
a phone line.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.277
DON: We're taking rounds here,
we're taking rounds.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.245
Back up, guys! Back up!

36:53.279 --> 36:54.346
Let's go. Get 'em on back.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.314
Get in position.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.415
Copy that.

36:58.884 --> 36:59.518
Move back!

36:59.551 --> 37:00.952
Don, we've got tear gas set.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.521
They got a clear shot
through a side window.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.722
No, no, no.
I don't want tear gas.

37:03.755 --> 37:04.856
We're not gonna have
another Waco here.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.825
You have no idea what he's
gonna do to those people.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.494
Rachel, hold on a second.
You gotta go to the hospital.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.561
No, I'm not going anywhere.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.463
- Listen, I understand...
- My shoulder is fine.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.766
I've been waiting to get
this guy my whole life!

37:22.574 --> 37:24.009
WILLIAM:
Prophet.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.944
Look like they're
ready to move in.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.479
What do you
want us to do?

37:27.513 --> 37:28.580
They're talking about peace.

37:28.614 --> 37:29.748
They're lying.

37:29.781 --> 37:32.551
What I want you to do is stand
there and cut them down

37:32.584 --> 37:34.786
one by one,
as they come.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.055
- Abner...
- You will speak when spoken to.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.490
Just talk to them.

37:38.524 --> 37:39.257
(screams)

37:43.061 --> 37:47.833
God has proclaimed
that today...

37:47.866 --> 37:49.335
today is the day.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.836
We will show the world

37:50.869 --> 37:53.739
our conviction
against their impurities.

37:53.772 --> 37:54.873
Against their,
their godlessness.

37:54.906 --> 38:01.313
He has said that after today
people will flock here.

38:01.347 --> 38:05.617
Here is the beginning
of the new city.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.519
Go! Go! Go!
Go get 'em!

38:07.553 --> 38:08.887
Wives, go stand
behind your husbands.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.392
Abner, there's a lot
more of them

38:13.425 --> 38:14.393
than us.

38:14.426 --> 38:14.993
(gunshot)

38:16.962 --> 38:18.964
Shots fired, shots fired.
Who's got eyes?

38:18.997 --> 38:21.333
He's shooting people
who want to leave.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.167
DON: All right, let's go.
We're gonna go.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.502
Guys, come on,
let's go, let's go.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.404
Everybody, we're moving in.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.305
(agents shouting in distance)

38:30.442 --> 38:32.077
He was half-hearted.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.783
You saw it.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.951
He was half-hearted.

38:39.985 --> 38:43.021
Go stand your positions
and cut them down one by one.

38:43.054 --> 38:46.625
Women, go to your husbands!

38:53.999 --> 38:58.670
Now is the time we make
our stand and you are saints.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.376
Go.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.512
(agents shouting
in distance)

39:13.552 --> 39:16.154
All right, nobody shoots unless
you have a good side picture.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.789
OFFICER (on radio):
Copy that. All teams re-align.

39:17.823 --> 39:18.757
OFFICER 2 (over radio):
Affirmative.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.462
(gas hissing)

39:26.898 --> 39:28.567
OFFICER (over radio):
Team two has a visual.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.743
No.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.182
Don, wait.
Somebody's coming out.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.717
STONE:
You are saints!

39:47.018 --> 39:48.920
All right, hold, hold, hold.

39:48.954 --> 39:51.490
What do you got?
You see it?

39:51.523 --> 39:52.691
I see a flame inside.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.528
Oh, propane tank.
Back up, back up.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.896
All right, get back, get back.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.899
I surrender.
Hold, hold.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.601
Get your hands up.
Get them up.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.970
I surrender to
the will of God.

40:16.047 --> 40:17.983
Let her go!

40:18.016 --> 40:19.751
Let go of her!

40:19.785 --> 40:21.587
Put your hands
behind your back.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.655
Come here, come here,
come here. You okay?

40:23.689 --> 40:26.525
God bless the martyrs!
God bless the martyrs!

40:26.558 --> 40:28.026
The martyrs that this
government has killed.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.828
Shut your mouth!

40:29.861 --> 40:31.830
I'm sorry.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.431
I know.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.134
You know, map blankets

41:09.167 --> 41:11.803
were part of the
Underground Railroad.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.238
Really?
Yeah.

41:13.271 --> 41:16.542
They stitched escape routes,
so the escaping slaves

41:16.575 --> 41:19.244
could find the safe houses.

41:19.277 --> 41:20.211
Wow, I didn't know that.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.614
Yeah, well, it worked
well in those cases,

41:22.648 --> 41:26.151
but, um, why
in the world would this, uh...

41:26.184 --> 41:28.253
Hard to call him
a man, isn't it?

41:28.286 --> 41:29.955
Yeah, it's hard
to call him a man.

41:29.988 --> 41:33.625
Why would this jerk put his
genealogy on the blanket?

41:33.659 --> 41:35.226
Trying to rewrite
history, I guess.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.996
Cover up his
genetic inadequacy.

41:38.029 --> 41:38.997
Those poor people.

41:39.030 --> 41:39.965
They were looking for God

41:39.998 --> 41:43.735
and all they did
was find this... monster.

41:45.303 --> 41:46.805
What are you doing?

41:46.838 --> 41:48.640
Just chatting
with Professor Pivito here.

41:48.674 --> 41:50.175
You know, he's still
at that math conference,

41:50.208 --> 41:52.177
and he said it really
isn't all that exciting.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.279
Oh, really?

41:54.312 --> 41:56.748
(chuckling)
You mock me, but you know,

41:56.782 --> 41:57.983
occasionally these
things can be...

41:58.016 --> 41:59.250
Hey, Donny.

41:59.284 --> 42:00.586
Hey.

42:00.619 --> 42:01.687
Come, sit with us.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.156
All right, let me grab a beer.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.659
Hey, what's up?

42:07.693 --> 42:08.393
He looks beat.

42:08.426 --> 42:10.095
A lot of people
died today, Dad.

42:10.128 --> 42:11.096
Yeah.

42:11.129 --> 42:15.801
But you, you saved
this woman and this child.

42:15.834 --> 42:17.235
That's something, isn't it?

42:17.268 --> 42:20.071
I don't think... I don't think
it ever feels like enough.

42:20.105 --> 42:22.974
Well, you can't save
the world, Charlie.

42:24.776 --> 42:26.044
What's the score
of the game?

42:26.077 --> 42:28.313
I don't know.
You've got to put it on.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.250
- Where's the remote?
- Don't ask me.

42:32.283 --> 42:33.719
Where's the remote?

42:33.752 --> 42:34.820
Where's the remote,
Charlie?

42:34.853 --> 42:35.821
I have no clue.

42:35.854 --> 42:36.955
- Well...
- That's not it.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.624
Charlie, where's
the other remote?
