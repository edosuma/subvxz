00:32.756 --> 00:33.951
HANK:
I bought this whetstone

00:33.992 --> 00:36.051
the day Bobby was born.

00:36.094 --> 00:39.586
I can't believe he's ready to
sharpen his first mower blade.

00:39.631 --> 00:44.659
Son...

00:44.703 --> 00:48.469
you're a teenager now,
on your way to becoming a man.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.668
This will help you
on the journey.

00:50.709 --> 00:53.803
Wow. I've always wanted
one of these.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.678
No, no! Stop that!

00:56.715 --> 00:57.682
(sighs)

00:57.716 --> 00:59.684
This is for sharpening
mower blades.

00:59.718 --> 01:01.948
You'll sharpen every Saturday

01:01.987 --> 01:03.011
and when you've shown me

01:03.054 --> 01:05.352
you can handle
the responsibility

01:05.390 --> 01:08.359
you'll get to use those blades
to mow the lawn.

01:08.393 --> 01:11.521
Okay.

01:11.563 --> 01:13.394
Hey, don't put that
down there.

01:13.431 --> 01:16.832
Oops. Sorry.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.962
Dang it, Bobby.

01:21.139 --> 01:22.470
You're going to rake leaves

01:22.507 --> 01:24.907
until that whetstone
is paid off.

01:24.943 --> 01:26.433
And every Thursday,
you're going to bag them

01:26.478 --> 01:27.672
and drag them to the curb

01:27.712 --> 01:31.113
so they can be picked up
by garbageman Morehouse.

01:31.149 --> 01:33.982
How about he grabs the bags
himself?

01:34.019 --> 01:35.611
He seems to like it, Dad.

01:35.654 --> 01:37.178
He's made a career of it.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.189
Start raking.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.851
(gasps)

01:43.094 --> 01:45.085
What the?

01:45.130 --> 01:49.726
Bobby!

01:49.768 --> 01:51.998
BOBBY:
Coming.

01:52.037 --> 01:53.299
Ow!

01:53.338 --> 01:56.239
Huh? I've been practicing
all morning.

01:56.274 --> 01:58.208
That's it.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.210
You're grounded

01:59.244 --> 02:01.371
until you're ready to pick up
those leaves.

02:01.413 --> 02:02.380
Okay.

02:02.414 --> 02:05.212
I mean it, mister.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.649
Can I take the rake
with me?

02:06.685 --> 02:07.652
No.

02:13.525 --> 02:14.549
Dinner's ready.

02:14.726 --> 02:15.784
(Bobby sniffling)

02:15.894 --> 02:17.191
In a minute.

02:17.996 --> 02:20.988
Son, I'm sorry I had to come
down hard on you, but you're...

02:21.032 --> 02:22.192
What are you doing?

02:22.233 --> 02:24.292
Just smelling stuff.

02:24.336 --> 02:25.769
(sniffs)

02:25.804 --> 02:26.771
Uh-huh.

02:26.805 --> 02:30.434
The clock radio smells
like my Game Boy

02:30.475 --> 02:33.672
but it tastes like
my library card.

02:33.712 --> 02:39.150
I wonder if it
smells different
when it's on?

02:39.184 --> 02:40.151
So, where's Bobby?

02:40.185 --> 02:42.653
I want to talk to
someone while you work.

02:42.687 --> 02:43.915
He's grounded.

02:43.955 --> 02:44.922
Not that he cares.

02:44.956 --> 02:49.222
He's just sitting there, uh...
smelling things in his room.

02:49.260 --> 02:51.228
(sighs):
That boy ain't right.

02:51.262 --> 02:52.229
Don't blame Bobby.

02:52.263 --> 02:55.528
You've been babying him
ever since he was a baby.

02:55.567 --> 02:56.829
I don't baby him.

02:56.868 --> 03:00.429
I've explained responsibility
to him a hundred times.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.439
Explain?!

03:01.473 --> 03:04.169
You don't explain responsibility
to a child.

03:04.209 --> 03:07.337
You pound it into them
with steel-toed boots.

03:07.379 --> 03:09.973
Uh, well, I-I don't really
know if...

03:10.015 --> 03:10.982
I know.

03:11.016 --> 03:11.983
And I'll tell you.

03:12.017 --> 03:14.383
We got to chisel the man
out of the baby fat

03:14.419 --> 03:19.755
via the Fort Berk Academy.

03:19.791 --> 03:21.190
That's what worked
for me.

03:21.226 --> 03:23.820
I always wanted to go
to the Academy.

03:23.862 --> 03:26.023
And I wish I
could've sent you.

03:26.064 --> 03:28.328
Unfortunately, you were such
a bumbling moron

03:28.366 --> 03:29.560
I couldn't vouch for you.

03:29.601 --> 03:31.933
I think I would've made
a great cadet.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.370
Nah, you wouldn't
have been no good.

03:34.406 --> 03:38.069
But if you'd gone, you'd
know how to handle Bobby.

03:38.109 --> 03:40.669
Yep, even the Academy's
two-week boot camp

03:40.712 --> 03:43.545
does more than most parents can
do to their kids in a lifetime.

03:43.581 --> 03:50.544
Now Bobby...
he'd make a fine cadet.

03:50.588 --> 03:52.283
Huh.

03:52.791 --> 03:54.816
I do not know how
Bobby gets this
cape so wrinkled.

03:54.859 --> 03:58.295
Yeah, I don't know what to do
about him, either.

03:58.329 --> 03:59.296
What would you think about

03:59.330 --> 04:02.128
letting the instructors at
Fort Berk take a crack at him?

04:02.167 --> 04:03.725
Cotton's old school?

04:03.768 --> 04:06.236
Sure. And then maybe
this summer

04:06.271 --> 04:08.239
we can send him
to Cotton's old POW camp.

04:08.273 --> 04:10.241
Peggy, I talked to the principal

04:10.275 --> 04:14.041
and he assured me that
they are tough, but not rough.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.047
He spent a long time
on the phone

04:16.081 --> 04:17.844
explaining the distinction.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.146
Come on. Today,
you're ironing his cape.

04:20.185 --> 04:21.846
If we don't take
drastic action

04:21.886 --> 04:24.116
tomorrow there'll be
a top hat in the picture.

04:24.155 --> 04:25.179
COTTON:
Bobby?

04:25.223 --> 04:26.747
It's your Gampy.

04:26.791 --> 04:30.352
We got a little present
for ya.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.384
Hi, Ging-ging.

04:31.429 --> 04:33.488
What'd you bring me?

04:33.531 --> 04:35.055
Wow, a costume!

04:35.100 --> 04:37.159
"You want the truth?

04:37.202 --> 04:39.762
You can't handle the truth!"

04:39.804 --> 04:40.828
It's perfect.

04:40.872 --> 04:43.432
This ain't no costume, boy.

04:43.475 --> 04:44.999
It's a uniform.

04:45.043 --> 04:49.742
Standard issue for all cadets
at Fort Berk Academy.

04:49.781 --> 04:50.748
Huh?

04:50.782 --> 04:51.840
Yep. We're giving you

04:51.883 --> 04:53.350
the privilege of attending

04:53.384 --> 04:56.820
the Academy's two-week
boot camp program.

04:56.855 --> 04:58.550
Enjoy your
spring break, son.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.557
Boot camp?

04:59.591 --> 05:01.889
Can't we work something out?

05:01.926 --> 05:05.862
What if I agreed to a spanking?

05:05.897 --> 05:08.229
You can have both.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.460
I'm not sure
what this means

05:09.501 --> 05:13.301
but I once heard that
when you're stuck in
an unpleasant situation

05:13.338 --> 05:16.603
it helps to just lie back
and think of England.

05:16.641 --> 05:18.040
(horn honking)

05:18.076 --> 05:19.941
That's enough,
Hank's wife!

05:19.978 --> 05:23.311
If you got more feelings
to express

05:23.348 --> 05:28.547
get in the kitchen
and put them in a bundt cake.

05:28.586 --> 05:29.484
Pi-diddle.

05:29.521 --> 05:30.613
(laughing)

05:30.655 --> 05:31.849
Come on, Bobby.

05:31.890 --> 05:33.858
Whenever you see a cripple plate

05:33.892 --> 05:36.156
yell "pi-diddle"
and punch your dad.

05:36.194 --> 05:38.856
I'm not much in the mood
to play games, Grandpa.

05:38.897 --> 05:40.091
Come on, boy.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.361
Take your tee-hees
while you can.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.697
Soon enough, all the silly

05:43.735 --> 05:46.465
is going to get beaten out
of you. For good.

05:46.504 --> 05:47.994
You'll be fine,
Bobby.

05:48.039 --> 05:49.563
But if you
start crying

05:49.607 --> 05:52.167
just try to push
the tears onto
your forehead

05:52.210 --> 05:53.734
so it'll look
like sweat.

05:53.778 --> 05:56.508
In my day, the principal
was the meanest son of a bitch

05:56.548 --> 05:58.709
God ever put on one leg.

05:58.750 --> 06:01.947
He'd lean on a desk with both
hands and swing his leg at you.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.954
Then, when you were
standing there

06:03.988 --> 06:06.786
shocked that a one-legged man
had kicked you, he'd bite you.

06:06.825 --> 06:07.792
Oops. Well.

06:07.826 --> 06:08.793
Huh.

06:08.827 --> 06:09.794
How you like that?

06:09.828 --> 06:16.927
Must've over-reminisced
and brought up my pain water.

06:16.968 --> 06:20.404
(moans sadly)

06:20.438 --> 06:22.998
(weakly):
Pi-diddle.

06:23.041 --> 06:27.307
COTTON:
There it is, boys.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.712
God! Ain't it beautiful?

06:30.748 --> 06:36.118
That, my friend,
is "the hole."

06:36.154 --> 06:37.121
If I had a nickel

06:37.155 --> 06:39.123
for every boy
that went loco in there

06:39.157 --> 06:40.886
I'd be eating
nickel soup.

06:40.925 --> 06:43.155
They can put a boy
in a hole?

06:43.194 --> 06:44.593
No, they...
They gots to!

06:44.629 --> 06:47.860
It's hard to be willful
if your will’s been broken.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.433
What are you doing?

06:55.473 --> 06:58.203
Well, I was planning
on coming in with you guys.

06:58.243 --> 07:01.076
I thought I explained
this to you 30 years ago.

07:01.112 --> 07:02.079
You ain't good enough!

07:02.113 --> 07:04.206
I was just going
to help Bobby get...

07:04.249 --> 07:05.216
You've helped enough!

07:05.250 --> 07:08.242
Starting now,
Fort Berk takes over.

07:08.286 --> 07:11.187
So keep yourself and your
hippie style of parenting

07:11.222 --> 07:15.591
outside the gate.

07:15.627 --> 07:18.095
Dad?

07:24.102 --> 07:26.900
Good Lord, they're going
to have to get bigger sticks

07:26.938 --> 07:29.372
to beat the frosting
out of these fatties.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.305
(laughing)

07:30.341 --> 07:32.332
But they'll do it.

07:32.377 --> 07:33.469
Colonel Hill,
it's an honor

07:33.511 --> 07:35.536
to finally meet
our most decorated alumnus.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.241
You're darn Skippy it is

07:37.282 --> 07:40.615
but I don’t wants my boy
getting no special handling.

07:40.652 --> 07:41.983
I assure you, Colonel

07:42.020 --> 07:44.011
he'll get the
standard treatment.

07:44.055 --> 07:45.022
(chuckling)

07:45.056 --> 07:46.023
(chuckling)

07:46.057 --> 07:47.024
Well, boy, may
God bless you.

07:47.058 --> 07:49.185
Not that it would
help you in here.

07:49.227 --> 07:52.822
I can hardly wait
to see my grandson

07:52.864 --> 07:54.161
all toughened up.

07:54.198 --> 08:00.159
You think you folks
could mail me copies

08:03.908 --> 08:05.603
of his daily beating logs?

08:05.643 --> 08:06.610
(chuckling)

08:06.644 --> 08:08.236
Colonel Hill,
you do realize

08:08.279 --> 08:10.247
things have changed
since your time here?

08:10.281 --> 08:13.648
All right, you can
e-mail them to me.

08:13.685 --> 08:16.347
(playing "Taps")

08:16.387 --> 08:18.184
Lights out!

08:18.222 --> 08:20.349
I suggest you get as much sleep
as you can

08:20.391 --> 08:22.359
before the senior
cadets come by

08:22.393 --> 08:24.088
to... welcome you.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.095
(laughing)

08:25.129 --> 08:26.096
(sobbing softly)

08:26.130 --> 08:32.330
BOY:
Oh, no, I made
a code yellow.

08:32.370 --> 08:35.703
Oh, God, my grandpa told me
they come in and beat you

08:35.740 --> 08:37.707
with sacks
full of frozen oranges.

08:37.741 --> 08:39.073
(gasping):
Oh, dang!

08:39.110 --> 08:41.203
Someone's coming.

08:41.245 --> 08:43.577
Lie back
and think of England.

08:43.614 --> 08:46.447
Hugh Grant, Spice Girls...
Paddington.

08:49.954 --> 08:53.082
(clanging)

08:57.128 --> 08:59.494
(cadets yelling)

09:00.531 --> 09:01.520
I don't get it.

09:01.566 --> 09:03.534
Why was that
supposed to be scary?

09:03.568 --> 09:06.731
Well, five more minutes
like that

09:06.771 --> 09:10.104
and I guess it might have caused
some hearing damage.

09:18.149 --> 09:20.913
Just think, when Bobby
comes home from Fort Berk

09:21.019 --> 09:24.978
he's going to be respectful,
obedient and easy to manage.

09:25.356 --> 09:29.349
That's right, Hank...
just like a... a show dog.

09:29.927 --> 09:31.451
(sobbing)

09:31.496 --> 09:34.056
My grandpa says
that all you get for breakfast

09:34.098 --> 09:37.329
is a spoonful of salt
and some stale bread.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.767
Oh, man!

09:38.803 --> 09:40.600
That's how they brainwash you.

09:40.638 --> 09:42.162
They starve you first.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.764
Okay, plebes, move it.

09:43.808 --> 09:44.433
Crepe station closes

09:44.475 --> 09:49.242
in five minutes.

09:54.986 --> 09:58.217
Uh, these sure are
some good peas, Peggy.

09:58.256 --> 09:59.223
What's your secret?

09:59.257 --> 10:00.690
Microwave.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.387
I wonder if Bobby's
being forced to sleep

10:03.428 --> 10:05.623
in mud or dung
right now?

10:05.663 --> 10:08.154
Wait, what's today, Tuesday?

10:08.399 --> 10:09.457
Dung.

10:10.168 --> 10:12.068
(bawling)

10:17.108 --> 10:19.042
No one is answering, Hank!

10:19.077 --> 10:21.443
Oh, they're probably
all bound and gagged.

10:21.479 --> 10:22.446
(gasping)

10:22.480 --> 10:23.504
Oh, my God.

10:23.548 --> 10:25.709
What if the wires
from this doorbell

10:25.750 --> 10:27.308
are connected to his nipples?

10:27.351 --> 10:29.581
It is worse
than I could have imagined!

10:29.620 --> 10:31.144
Will you let us in?!

10:31.189 --> 10:36.286
Let us in!

10:36.327 --> 10:38.261
We demand to see Bobby Hill!

10:38.296 --> 10:39.422
Peggy, protocol.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.762
Sir, permission
to see Cadet Hill

10:41.799 --> 10:44.495
while keeping a respectful
distance from the grounds.

10:44.535 --> 10:46.059
Oh, you're his father.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.537
We talked on the phone.

10:47.572 --> 10:48.937
You're welcome to come in.

10:48.973 --> 10:49.940
I am?

10:49.974 --> 10:51.942
Of course, and
so is your lawyer.

10:51.976 --> 10:53.944
We have nothing to hide.

11:01.652 --> 11:03.017
Your concern for your son

11:03.054 --> 11:05.386
is perfectly normal,
but I can assure you

11:05.423 --> 11:07.983
Cadet Hill is
excelling here.

11:08.025 --> 11:08.992
Mom! Dad!

11:09.026 --> 11:13.122
Bobby! Honey,
are you okay?

11:13.164 --> 11:14.631
Blink if you're not.

11:14.665 --> 11:16.189
I'm great, ma'am.

11:16.234 --> 11:18.202
Cadet Hill, why don't
you take your parents

11:18.236 --> 11:20.204
to Survival
Crafts class?

11:20.238 --> 11:23.332
I can attend a class
at Fort Berk?

11:23.374 --> 11:25.342
Well, I won't let you down,
Bobby.

11:25.376 --> 11:27.173
I mean, Cadet Hill.

11:27.211 --> 11:28.405
On the battlefield

11:28.446 --> 11:30.038
you may find yourself stranded

11:30.081 --> 11:32.276
without enough
water to survive

11:32.316 --> 11:34.284
but with a sufficient
quantity of mud

11:34.318 --> 11:35.285
you will have
the ability

11:35.319 --> 11:37.583
to create your own bowl,
pot, urn, decanter

11:37.622 --> 11:40.318
or beaker to
collect rainwater.

11:43.594 --> 11:45.459
Very nice work,
Mr. Hill.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.294
We'll make sure to have
that glazed before you go.

11:48.332 --> 11:49.299
Did you hear
that, Peggy?

11:49.333 --> 11:50.561
I'm doing it.

11:50.601 --> 11:53.092
I'm Fort Berk material.

11:58.976 --> 12:00.466
Where's dinner?

12:00.511 --> 12:02.240
It's 3:00, Dad.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.577
I can't eat excuses.

12:03.614 --> 12:04.740
You heard from Bobby?

12:04.782 --> 12:06.113
Yeah, he's, uh, surviving.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.117
Surviving?!

12:07.151 --> 12:09.619
He's got too much
of you and that one

12:09.654 --> 12:11.679
to be surviving at Fort Berk.

12:11.722 --> 12:12.689
Even I

12:12.723 --> 12:13.690
barely survived

12:13.724 --> 12:16.557
and I didn't have Gas Monkey
and Sasquatch for parents.

12:16.594 --> 12:18.619
I will have you know, Cotton

12:18.663 --> 12:20.028
that Bobby
is thriving.

12:20.064 --> 12:23.158
We went to Fort Berk
yesterday and saw him.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.226
What in the name of Ned?!

12:25.269 --> 12:28.363
They ain't supposed
to let you two on campus.

12:28.406 --> 12:30.374
They are required
to by law

12:30.408 --> 12:33.502
and we sat in on
one of his classes.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.944
Hank, show him
the bowl you made.

12:35.980 --> 12:36.947
What the?!

12:36.981 --> 12:38.005
You made a bowl?

12:38.049 --> 12:39.016
Well, yeah.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.483
It's a combat bowl.

12:40.518 --> 12:41.644
Bobby made one, too.

12:41.686 --> 12:42.778
Combat bowl?

12:42.820 --> 12:44.651
The only bowl
he's supposed to make

12:44.689 --> 12:48.557
is from a hollowed-out skull.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.227
How you doing in there,
you poor saps?

13:00.271 --> 13:03.866
(chortling)

13:03.908 --> 13:10.211
What the?

13:10.715 --> 13:13.206
(screaming)

13:14.218 --> 13:16.584
Is that all the respect
you got for me?

13:16.621 --> 13:18.851
You go and turn
my childhood home

13:18.889 --> 13:20.789
into a giant
sissy factory!

13:20.825 --> 13:22.554
How's my grandson
supposed to toughen up

13:22.593 --> 13:23.491
with you candying his ass?!

13:23.527 --> 13:26.325
Sir, when I got here
from Antioch College...

13:26.364 --> 13:28.559
You're fired! Get out!

13:28.599 --> 13:29.657
You can’t just fire me.

13:29.700 --> 13:30.928
Is that a fact?

13:30.968 --> 13:31.957
Okay, Powder puff

13:32.003 --> 13:37.202
I would like you to speak
to Clean Latrine Gene

13:37.241 --> 13:42.975
who happens to be the chairman
of your board of trustees.

13:43.014 --> 13:44.538
General Gene Jefford?

13:44.582 --> 13:45.606
That's right.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.639
Uh, h-hello.

13:46.684 --> 13:48.743
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.515
Very well, I...

13:50.554 --> 13:52.886
Can I keep the
Aeron desk chair?

13:52.923 --> 13:53.890
Thank you, sir.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.155
Hey, after this

14:02.199 --> 14:04.167
let's go to the mess
and get a smoothie.

14:10.708 --> 14:12.198
Grandpa?

14:12.243 --> 14:15.303
Fall in!

14:15.346 --> 14:19.942
The previous commander
was just as soft

14:19.984 --> 14:21.713
and ineffective as your parents

14:21.752 --> 14:25.017
and your parents are not paying
good money for that.

14:25.056 --> 14:28.025
Now, I'm here to make sure
they get their money's worth.

14:28.059 --> 14:29.549
With interest.

14:29.593 --> 14:30.525
(gasping)

14:30.561 --> 14:32.153
There's going to be changes
around here

14:32.196 --> 14:34.562
and ain't none of you
going to like it.

14:34.598 --> 14:36.862
Day is night, joy is pain,
love is hate!

14:36.901 --> 14:43.636
(groaning)

14:43.674 --> 14:45.266
Good thinking, Private McFainty.

14:45.309 --> 14:46.367
Sleep up

14:46.410 --> 14:48.310
'cause starting
at 0400 hours

14:48.346 --> 14:50.644
you don't
gets no more.

14:50.681 --> 14:54.242
See you at sunrise, weakies.

15:01.892 --> 15:03.052
State your business.

15:03.094 --> 15:05.619
Grandpa. Gampy. Ging-ging.

15:05.663 --> 15:09.224
It's Bobby here. Your Bing-Bing.

15:09.266 --> 15:12.167
I ain't your Ging-ging,
and you ain'ts my Bing-bing.

15:12.203 --> 15:15.001
And if you think I'm giving you
special treatment, well...

15:15.039 --> 15:16.597
you're right on target.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.369
Good, because I told
the fellows...

15:18.409 --> 15:22.470
Hush, boy!
I will "special treat" you
to a double dose of pain!

15:22.513 --> 15:24.811
Why?

15:24.849 --> 15:25.781
I want you
to come out

15:25.816 --> 15:27.443
of this cauldron
of burning hell

15:27.485 --> 15:29.544
the best damn cadet
you can be.

15:29.587 --> 15:32.078
Thanks, but you don't
have to worry about that.

15:32.123 --> 15:35.058
All we really want
is the phone service back

15:35.092 --> 15:38.118
and the mattresses for our beds.

15:38.162 --> 15:39.129
Quiet!

15:39.163 --> 15:40.824
Now, your daddy
tells me

15:40.865 --> 15:43.629
you have a problem
raking leaves.

15:43.667 --> 15:44.793
Well, I guarantee

15:44.835 --> 15:47.099
you won't have a problem
raking leaves

15:47.138 --> 15:51.370
after you've picked up every
leaf on this campus with...

15:51.409 --> 15:54.503
a fork!

16:02.486 --> 16:03.510
(screams)

16:03.587 --> 16:05.578
What the hell are
you doing, boy?!

16:05.723 --> 16:08.590
You gave me a fork,
so I figured I'd eat the leaves.

16:08.626 --> 16:11.925
Boy, am I stuffed!

16:11.962 --> 16:15.898
(chuckles):
Just kidding, Grandpa.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.298
(groans)

16:17.334 --> 16:18.801
Maybe this is my fault

16:18.836 --> 16:20.895
for not properly
motivating you.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.371
If it's food you want...

16:22.406 --> 16:24.306
I could eat.

16:24.341 --> 16:25.467
COTTON:
You don’t want to rake

16:25.509 --> 16:27.238
then maybe you need more energy.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.008
This rotten pile of backwash
is all for you, boy.

16:30.047 --> 16:31.480
And you're gonna
keep shoveling it down

16:31.515 --> 16:33.847
until it starts
coming up!

16:33.884 --> 16:36.512
Okay.

16:52.703 --> 16:54.068
Dinner's over.

16:54.104 --> 16:57.164
Now I'm gonna give you
something cold for dessert.

16:57.208 --> 16:58.175
Okay.

16:58.209 --> 17:01.645
Anything cracks

17:01.679 --> 17:02.976
if you freeze it
long enough.

17:09.619 --> 17:11.109
How you doing,
boy?

17:12.356 --> 17:13.617
I'm okay.

17:13.656 --> 17:17.148
Mom says I'm naturally built
for winter climates.

17:17.194 --> 17:19.094
God dang it!

17:19.128 --> 17:22.257
You're going
into the hole.

17:22.299 --> 17:25.462
The hole's
what broke me

17:25.502 --> 17:28.369
and that's what's
gonna break you, too.

17:29.940 --> 17:33.068
Time to say good-bye, soldier.

17:33.110 --> 17:37.570
Go and get in your grow-up box!

17:37.615 --> 17:38.582
Ging-ging?

17:38.616 --> 17:39.674
Quit your
still-standing.

17:39.717 --> 17:44.211
Start running
till you hit the horizon.

17:58.969 --> 18:00.095
SPOONY:
See, Forky?

18:00.137 --> 18:01.695
I just knew
there was a better world

18:01.739 --> 18:03.263
outside the cutlery drawer.

18:03.307 --> 18:04.831
(whispers):
I wonder what
Bobby's doing now?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.536
Probably having a bull
session in the barracks

18:06.577 --> 18:08.909
with his new pals.

18:10.748 --> 18:13.444
Bobby? Bobby, are you okay?!

18:13.484 --> 18:23.917
Tap once if you're okay.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.661
(doorbell rings)

18:29.700 --> 18:30.667
Oh, hey, Didi.

18:30.701 --> 18:32.430
I've got the new
TV Guide here

18:32.469 --> 18:35.199
with all the judge shows
circled like my dad likes.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.206
Is he around?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.401
No. Cotton's
at Fort Berk.

18:38.442 --> 18:41.502
What?
He has temporarily
taken over the Academy.

18:41.545 --> 18:43.206
Oh, my God, no.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.647
Yes. He is ruling
with an iron fist.

18:45.683 --> 18:48.584
He threw Bobby
in the hole about
three days ago.

18:48.652 --> 18:49.949
Bwaaagh!

18:51.989 --> 18:54.048
He ain't gonna be
a pretty sight, boys.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.059
Humpty Dumpty's done cracked

18:56.093 --> 18:58.061
but now we can put him
back together

18:58.095 --> 19:00.563
and rebuild him
as a super-cadet.

19:09.907 --> 19:12.171
Dad, are you crazy? Let him out.

19:12.209 --> 19:13.836
I was just fixing to.

19:13.877 --> 19:20.612
Bobby? Bobby?

19:20.651 --> 19:21.618
Give him some air.

19:21.652 --> 19:22.949
Bobby?

19:22.987 --> 19:24.454
Hmm?

19:24.488 --> 19:25.955
Hmm?

19:25.990 --> 19:29.016
Uh... oh.

19:29.059 --> 19:31.027
Hey, Dad.

19:32.062 --> 19:36.362
(awning)

19:36.400 --> 19:38.527
Ooh.

19:38.569 --> 19:43.506
Well, I've tried a mattress,
I've tried cement...

19:43.540 --> 19:46.532
I'm a mattress guy.

19:46.577 --> 19:47.737
(laughing)

19:47.778 --> 19:49.143
Bobby,
you're okay?!

19:49.179 --> 19:51.147
Same 'ol, same 'ol.

19:53.884 --> 19:55.010
I was merciless!

19:55.052 --> 19:56.280
I dropped down on him

19:56.320 --> 19:58.447
like a steam trunk
full of concrete!

19:58.489 --> 19:59.786
HANK:
You didn't budge him

19:59.823 --> 20:00.983
did you?

20:01.025 --> 20:01.992
(chuckles)

20:02.026 --> 20:03.994
I... I don't get it.
What's so funny?

20:04.028 --> 20:05.086
I told you it wasn’t easy.

20:05.129 --> 20:07.097
You didn't believe me,
did you, Dad?

20:07.131 --> 20:10.157
(sighs):
I guess he was just
born a pile of mush.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.168
Well, I guess
you could say that.

20:12.202 --> 20:13.863
But maybe mush
isn't all bad.

20:13.904 --> 20:15.599
You can keep
stomping on it

20:15.639 --> 20:17.664
but it's all give;
it just stays mush.

20:17.708 --> 20:18.970
You can't build it up

20:19.009 --> 20:20.977
but you can't break it down,
either.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.809
In a funny way,
mush kind of has the edge.

20:23.847 --> 20:24.871
(laughs)

20:24.915 --> 20:30.717
Can you imagine that pile
of mush in the POW camps?

20:30.754 --> 20:34.019
He would've driven
them Tojos crazy.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.047
Three days with Bobby

20:35.092 --> 20:36.821
and they would've
quit the war!

20:36.860 --> 20:38.054
(laughing)

20:38.095 --> 20:42.395
I wish you could've seen
the old Fort Berk, Hank.

20:42.433 --> 20:45.664
But I guess
those days is gone.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.069
You know, Colonel,
all this time I've
been talking to you

20:48.105 --> 20:50.232
you didn’t grant me
permission to speak.

20:52.342 --> 20:53.309
That's right.

20:53.343 --> 20:55.311
That's practically
insubordination.

20:55.345 --> 20:57.905
You better drop
and give me 20, boy.

20:57.948 --> 20:58.915
Yes, sir.

20:58.949 --> 21:00.576
Two, three, four.

21:00.617 --> 21:05.145
No, no, you're doing it
wrong, Cadet!

21:05.189 --> 21:06.451
Start over!

21:06.490 --> 21:09.823
How'd you do it,
Bobby?

21:09.860 --> 21:11.122
How'd you survive
the hole?

21:11.161 --> 21:14.597
Well, I admit, I started
getting a little worried.

21:14.631 --> 21:17.623
But then I found some
inspirational graffiti

21:17.668 --> 21:20.068
on the wall
and it kept me going.
