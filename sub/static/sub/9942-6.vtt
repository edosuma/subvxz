He can't tell me what to do anyway.
He's not me dad.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.871
You should be grateful it was us

10:34.911 --> 10:38.071
lt's only class C, lan.
They've practically decriminalised it.

10:38.111 --> 10:41.191

- Drug squad all over the estate!

10:41.231 --> 10:42.551
Yeah, lan...

10:48.951 --> 10:51.231
You jack it in now!

You act like l'm a little kid!
All of you!

11:23.790 --> 11:27.991
and l thought me and you were
trying to sort things out back there.

11:30.951 --> 11:33.951
What the fuck's all this?!
You're dealing drugs from her pram?!

11:33.991 --> 11:36.711
- She's not smoking it!
- Wouldn't hurt her if she was.

11:36.750 --> 11:39.071
Shane used to do my gear.
There's nothing wrong with him.

11:39.111 --> 11:41.191
So why aren't l doing
the drug run then?!

11:41.231 --> 11:43.111
Cos you're too fucking stupid.

11:43.151 --> 11:46.191
Dad would never have this!
There's six lads in this family

11:46.231 --> 11:48.911
- and it's her who's running the business!
- When he gets out you can tell him!

11:48.951 --> 11:51.111
And about how you can't
do it cos you can't count!

11:51.151 --> 11:51.871

11:58.871 --> 12:01.271
Well, that's easy to solve
then, in't it, Lip?

12:01.311 --> 12:03.511
Don't see her at all. You're barred.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.951

13:51.710 --> 13:53.911
You all right, Chloe?

13:53.951 --> 13:57.351
Yeah. Is Mandy in?

13:57.390 --> 14:00.631
No, but l am.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.671
Oi, fucMace!
l want double that amount ne_ time.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.231
So get fucking busy.

14:08.750 --> 14:11.311
Let yourself in, ladies.

14:16.151 --> 14:18.831
Mandy, do you want a chocolate?

14:18.871 --> 14:20.831
l always eat
chocolate when l'm upset

14:20.871 --> 14:23.311
cos it does the same to
your brain as a hug does.

14:23.351 --> 14:26.191
l'm not upset, Debbie!
Just keep out of it, will you?

14:28.311 --> 14:31.471
Look, l know you want to think
of me and your brother as some big...

14:31.510 --> 14:34.751
romantic thing,
but we're not, all right?

14:34.790 --> 14:38.231
l got pregnant. That's all.

14:38.271 --> 14:41.031
lt's just biology.

14:41.071 --> 14:43.071
Actually, no, it's not biology.

14:43.111 --> 14:44.591
lt's fucking history.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.311
lt's Carl, in't it?

14:58.750 --> 15:01.511
Yeah.

15:01.550 --> 15:02.871
So what you buying then?

15:02.911 --> 15:05.591
Nothing.

15:05.630 --> 15:08.151
You grow weed for Mandy.

15:08.191 --> 15:12.271
ls it hard?
How do you do it?

15:12.311 --> 15:13.831
l can show you if you like.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.471
You're not gonna get
high sniming that.

15:16.510 --> 15:18.551
Glue's down here.

15:19.590 --> 15:22.391
Just a couple of minutes away.

15:28.991 --> 15:30.271
ls that your brother?

15:30.311 --> 15:31.791
Yeah.

15:31.830 --> 15:34.591
They're through here.
l had to move them

15:34.630 --> 15:37.151
cos he doesn't like me growing them.

15:42.311 --> 15:45.271
Wow, that's amazing!

15:45.311 --> 15:47.031
God, look at them all!

15:55.231 --> 15:58.391
Careful with her.
She's about to flower.

15:58.430 --> 15:59.991
She?

16:00.031 --> 16:03.951
Kirsten. It's only the
female ones that flower.

16:03.991 --> 16:05.551
That's the bit you need.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.991
Can l call one Chloe?

16:08.031 --> 16:10.271
lf you like. >

16:10.311 --> 16:11.391
This one, then.

16:14.911 --> 16:17.391
Do you want to smoke some?

16:17.430 --> 16:18.751
Yeah!

16:18.790 --> 16:20.871
Frank? >

16:20.911 --> 16:22.271
Frank!

16:22.311 --> 16:24.911
What? Oh, don't tell me -

16:24.951 --> 16:29.111
space aliens from the planet Ork
have turned Nigel into an olive.

16:29.151 --> 16:33.791
Our Karen's a lesbian!
Why would she not have told me, Frank?

16:33.830 --> 16:36.591
Sheila, love, l know you're
not a natural blonde, l know

16:36.630 --> 16:40.991
you're not as stupid as you look,
but your Karen is not into KD Lang.

16:41.031 --> 16:44.231
But she is Frank!
l'm telling you, l've just found out!

16:44.271 --> 16:47.551
And that's just the kind of attitude
that's stopped her being honest

16:47.590 --> 16:50.791
about it in the first place!
She was worried we might judge her!

16:52.911 --> 16:56.311
l want you to say it now, Frank!

16:56.351 --> 16:58.871
Out loud and proud!

16:58.911 --> 17:00.591
What our Karen is!

17:02.311 --> 17:04.871
Go on, say it!
Give voice to it! Say it!

17:06.430 --> 17:08.351
Say it!

17:08.390 --> 17:11.111
Karen sucks gash.

17:12.670 --> 17:14.711
There! See?

17:14.750 --> 17:16.631
lt wasn't that dimicult, was it?

17:18.191 --> 17:22.151
But if she can't be honest with me
in the first place, her own mother,

17:22.191 --> 17:23.711
then l've failed her!

17:24.750 --> 17:29.231
l've failed her!
Oh, Karen, l'm so sorry!

17:34.071 --> 17:35.991
And then... !

17:40.151 --> 17:43.351
And then... l don't know if l...
l can't even tell...!

17:43.390 --> 17:44.751
What?!

17:44.790 --> 17:46.991
PHONE BEEPS
Ignore!

17:49.710 --> 17:51.791
Fillet of fish?!

17:52.790 --> 17:55.391
Can l come again?

17:58.030 --> 17:59.951
- Yeah.
- No!

18:05.870 --> 18:08.751
Bye. Whoa!

18:10.071 --> 18:14.311
So what you're saying is,
you want me to come to dinner?

18:14.350 --> 18:15.111
That's right!

18:15.151 --> 18:18.871
lf this is you thinking you
can wipe Frank's tab, Sheila...

18:18.911 --> 18:22.391
No, no, not at all! l'm sorry,
l'll pay you now if you like.

18:22.431 --> 18:25.791
l just thought...as
a surprise for Karen.

18:25.831 --> 18:28.951
A few of her close friends.

18:31.030 --> 18:33.351
- You do like her, don't you?
- Yeah.

18:33.390 --> 18:34.871
Oh, good!

18:36.390 --> 18:40.551
l just wasn't sure how...you know...

18:42.870 --> 18:44.991
So you'll come then?

18:45.030 --> 18:47.711
Yeah, all right, Sheila.
If you like.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.391
Oh, that's lovely! All right, then.

18:50.431 --> 18:52.231
l'll see you later!

18:54.190 --> 18:55.791
See you later.

19:07.431 --> 19:09.191
All right, quick as you can, inside.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.511
Shit!

19:16.190 --> 19:17.671
Drug squad!

19:21.030 --> 19:24.511
Oh, yes! Well, lookey here!
Right little factory.

19:24.550 --> 19:26.191
We've hit the jackpot this time.

19:31.710 --> 19:33.231
(Lip) Say nothing, Carl!

19:36.350 --> 19:38.871
Have you seen this lot?

19:38.911 --> 19:40.271
They're for home consumption.

19:40.311 --> 19:41.471
Oh, yeah?

19:41.511 --> 19:43.231
- No, me dad's ill.
- l believe you.

19:43.710 --> 19:46.911
He's got... ME?

19:48.071 --> 19:49.871
MS.

19:49.911 --> 19:51.711
Look, no-one's so ill
they need this much.

19:51.751 --> 19:55.551
Have you seen the state of him?
You've not, have you?

19:55.591 --> 19:58.151
- Get up.
- What you doing?

19:58.190 --> 19:59.831
- Come on.
- What you doing?

19:59.870 --> 20:01.631
Let's take him down the station.

20:01.671 --> 20:04.831
You shut up, you little dog.
Watch your head.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.751
Get om me, you muppet!

20:06.790 --> 20:08.791
- Russell?
- Shut up.

20:08.831 --> 20:10.631
Look, he's me little brother.

20:10.671 --> 20:12.511
l'll make him stop
doing it, but please...

20:12.550 --> 20:14.711
All right. l'm not gonna charge him.

20:14.751 --> 20:18.111
He'll make a statement and
he'll be out in an hour, OK?

20:18.151 --> 20:19.631
How do you know he were doing it?

20:21.831 --> 20:24.951
lnfra-red photos.
Picks up the heat from the lamps.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.911
lf your roofs not insulated...
We sell them on afteM/ards. Gas Board.

20:28.950 --> 20:30.711
You might get a sales call.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.711
Russell?

20:32.751 --> 20:34.511
Thanks.

20:39.231 --> 20:41.591
He should be back by now.

20:41.630 --> 20:43.511
Can you check if he's OK?

20:43.550 --> 20:45.431
They said they weren't charging him.

20:45.470 --> 20:47.591
Well, ain't he the lucky one.

20:47.630 --> 20:49.871
lt's weird they gave you the photo,
though. They're normally bastards.

20:49.911 --> 20:53.311
lt's his own stupid fault. l told
him not to mess with the Maguires.

20:53.350 --> 20:55.151
Yeah.

20:55.190 --> 20:57.711
And he should've listened to you.
Where is he?

21:00.110 --> 21:02.111
Cos l've had some bad news.

21:02.151 --> 21:06.831
My pet pig says someone's made
an anonymous statement against us.

21:06.870 --> 21:07.831
Your what?

21:07.870 --> 21:09.551
Me tame copper.

21:09.591 --> 21:12.151
Me little bent squealer.

21:12.190 --> 21:14.311
- Yeah? Well, it in't Carl, is it?
- No?

21:14.350 --> 21:17.471
Cos l'm finding it a bit of a
stretch

21:17.511 --> 21:20.631
that the drug squad found his crop

21:20.671 --> 21:23.751
but decided not to charge him.

21:23.790 --> 21:27.191
They might have.
He's still at the station.

21:27.231 --> 21:28.431
- No, he ain't.
- They've let him go.

21:28.470 --> 21:30.431
Without charging him.

21:30.470 --> 21:32.631
Our piggy told us.

21:32.671 --> 21:33.671
So where is he?

21:33.710 --> 21:36.071
Look, Carl wouldn't do that.
He was working for you.

21:36.110 --> 21:39.431
And, hard as it is to believe,
we are family now.

21:45.270 --> 21:48.111
- What are you're looking at?
- Well, l don't rightly know.

21:48.151 --> 21:50.471
But it's bloody ugly and
it seems to be looking back.

21:50.511 --> 21:52.871
No, Mimi, what Carol means is...

21:52.911 --> 21:54.431
What's going on? Ermintrude!

21:54.470 --> 21:56.951
Sorry.

21:56.991 --> 21:59.591
You lot better start
saying your prayers.

21:59.630 --> 22:01.911
Cos Carl's fucking dead.

22:01.950 --> 22:04.271
Check the house.

22:04.311 --> 22:06.231
Jabba!

22:07.311 --> 22:09.031
Gallagher! Gallagher!

22:09.071 --> 22:13.151
Where the fuck are
you hiding, you little shit?

22:13.190 --> 22:16.551
Gallagher, you grass!

22:18.511 --> 22:20.991
You're fucking dead, Gallagher.

22:22.831 --> 22:24.311
Fuck you.

22:26.831 --> 22:29.351
Oi! Fuck om!

22:29.390 --> 22:30.751
Dicko!

22:36.950 --> 22:38.631
Run! Fucking run, Gallagher!

22:38.671 --> 22:40.711
Maguires are after yer!

22:44.030 --> 22:47.871
Why are you fucking running, Dicko?
What d'you know? Where's Gallagher?

22:47.911 --> 22:49.871
l don't know nothing! Let go!

22:50.751 --> 22:52.391
You take him.

22:52.431 --> 22:53.911
Where the fuck is Carl Gallagher?

22:53.950 --> 22:56.191
l don't know! l don't know anything!

22:56.231 --> 22:58.991
All right, Shane!

22:59.030 --> 23:01.111
Fuck! Where is he?!

23:01.151 --> 23:04.071
Go easy, Shane! Fuck it.
What are you doing?

23:04.110 --> 23:05.351
Where is he, you little fuck?

23:05.390 --> 23:07.871
Shane.

23:09.030 --> 23:10.511
You bastard. >

23:15.431 --> 23:17.351
Have you seen Carl?

23:17.390 --> 23:19.911
Do l look like a probation omicer?

23:20.991 --> 23:22.831
Mandy, have you seen him?

23:22.870 --> 23:25.391
- If l had, l wouldn't be telling you.
- You all right, mate?

23:25.431 --> 23:27.911
Come on. You know what they'll
do to him if they find him.

23:27.950 --> 23:29.751
Shouldn't have grassed us up then.

23:29.790 --> 23:31.471
He didn't! He's only a fucking kid!

23:31.511 --> 23:35.311
Which means he won't get a
custodial! Whereas my mum...

23:35.350 --> 23:37.071
Jesus, Mandy.

23:37.110 --> 23:38.271
Lip!

23:38.311 --> 23:40.591
When did all this turn into a war?

23:40.630 --> 23:43.151
l thought me and you
could have had something.

23:43.190 --> 23:48.351
What are you doing with this guy?
What went wrong between us?

23:48.390 --> 23:51.311
Look, Lip.
l didn't make Carl do it.

23:51.350 --> 23:55.231
He chose to. Because he wanted
to help you lot out with money.

23:56.870 --> 23:59.791
Well, he's not in
the fucking carton, is he?

23:59.831 --> 24:01.551
Buy summat or fuck om.

24:05.151 --> 24:07.511
FART

24:19.950 --> 24:21.151
Come on, Karen, get stuck in!

24:21.190 --> 24:22.871
l love a good oyster, me!

24:22.911 --> 24:25.111
lt's best if you eat 'em alive.

24:25.151 --> 24:28.511
Stun 'em with something
sharp and pop 'em straight in.

24:36.991 --> 24:39.031
Come on Karen, love. >

24:39.071 --> 24:41.351
lt was your idea!

24:41.390 --> 24:42.751
l'm not so keen thanks, Mum.

24:47.831 --> 24:51.191
So, where are you from originally?
Was your mother a lesbian?

24:51.231 --> 24:53.311
Not so far as l know, Sheila.

24:53.350 --> 24:56.151
But you never really do.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.911
Karen used to be interested
in blokes,

24:58.950 --> 25:02.551
but when Frank moved in,
she lost all interest.

25:02.591 --> 25:06.071
l thought l'd damaged
her or something!

25:06.110 --> 25:09.191
Then l realised l didn't
have to be guilty any more.

25:09.231 --> 25:13.391
l hadn't messed her up, she was
just gay all along! Oh, thank you.

25:15.630 --> 25:17.671
What do you do, Jez, when you
want a bit of real sex?

25:17.710 --> 25:19.951
Do strap a thing on or summat?

25:19.991 --> 25:22.151
What we do is real sex.

25:22.190 --> 25:25.111
lt's only blokes who are
obsessed with penises.

25:25.151 --> 25:29.711
Oh, no! l am too! l love 'em! Oh!

25:29.751 --> 25:31.551
l love 'em.

25:31.591 --> 25:35.391
Why don't you girls all do
a floor-show then?

25:35.431 --> 25:37.111
Get your baubles out?

25:37.151 --> 25:38.831
Have Christmas early, shall we?

25:38.870 --> 25:41.551
For Christ's sake, Frank!

25:44.671 --> 25:46.991
Just a thought.

25:47.030 --> 25:48.551
lt would be nice though.

25:48.591 --> 25:50.551
(Sheila) Have you seen that film... >

25:57.831 --> 26:02.071
l never said om! They wanted a
statement that it were for home use.

26:04.350 --> 26:07.871
- l believe him, Debbie.
- Yeah, so do l.

26:08.550 --> 26:09.791
Even though he's a twat.

26:09.831 --> 26:14.111
The Maguires don't believe him.
They're gonna kill him.

26:14.151 --> 26:15.751
You'll have to hide up here
till we get it sorted.

26:15.790 --> 26:17.711
You're joking?!

26:17.751 --> 26:21.831
Anne Frank did it, and those
children in Flowers In The Attic.

26:21.870 --> 26:25.111
Except they all got really deformed
cos they had no sunlight,

26:25.151 --> 26:27.671
then the sister got pregnant
by the brother

26:27.710 --> 26:30.431
and they had this funny little baby
and it became a ballet dancer!

26:30.470 --> 26:32.871
Where's your phone, Carl?

26:35.751 --> 26:37.591
< Right.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.471
You phone us if you need anything.

26:39.511 --> 26:41.431
We'll tell the
Maguires you've run away.

26:41.470 --> 26:45.711
You can start dismantling
this lot while you're up here.

26:49.470 --> 26:51.711
Don't write a diary, though.

27:06.511 --> 27:08.671
Ooh, hello!

27:08.710 --> 27:11.471
Sheila, l'm not really sure
what's going on here.

27:11.511 --> 27:13.191
The vibes l'm getting om Karen?

27:13.231 --> 27:15.391
She likes you. She's just shy.

27:15.431 --> 27:16.871
Do you really think so?

27:16.911 --> 27:19.351
She kissed you, didn't she?

27:19.390 --> 27:23.631
Oh, hello. Look, why don't
you both stay here tonight?

27:23.671 --> 27:25.271
You can have Frank and my bed.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.631
We'll sleep downstairs.

27:36.470 --> 27:40.271
The kids are all right...
Just give us five minutes.

27:40.311 --> 27:41.991
Yeah, all right.

27:51.870 --> 27:53.551
What do you want?

27:53.591 --> 27:57.471
l never got a chance to thank you.
For not cautioning Carl today.

27:57.511 --> 27:58.431
You never said you were a copper.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.871
You never said your
family were scumbags.

28:00.911 --> 28:02.391
All right.

28:05.190 --> 28:06.551
What do you want?

28:06.591 --> 28:09.911
The Maguires think it were Carl
who grassed and l know it wasn't,

28:09.950 --> 28:12.111
so l need to know who
to get him out of shit.

28:12.151 --> 28:14.271
Look, l...

28:16.431 --> 28:19.151
Davies reckons they
get it all the time... >

28:19.190 --> 28:21.991
l let him om so you
wouldn't blow the gam on me.

28:22.030 --> 28:25.031
Now we're equal,
so fuck om and don't come back.

28:27.190 --> 28:28.871
Who's that? >

28:28.911 --> 28:31.431
< Just another Chatswo_h arsehole.

28:32.991 --> 28:38.231
Right, bed, video camera, sex toys.
Give us a shout if you need me.

28:38.270 --> 28:39.911
ln your dreams.

28:42.270 --> 28:45.031
Bed and board, Karen, bed and board.

28:52.270 --> 28:54.711
Here we are then.

28:54.751 --> 28:56.751
What d'you reckon?

28:56.790 --> 29:00.071
Undress you slowly, shall l?

29:00.110 --> 29:01.191
Get my nifty tongue out?

29:01.231 --> 29:04.431
There's something
l need to tell yer.

29:04.470 --> 29:08.151
What's the matter?
Got the decorators in, have you?

29:08.190 --> 29:10.151
l'm straight.

29:12.270 --> 29:14.111
l'm really sorry.

29:14.151 --> 29:18.591
You're lovely and that, but l only said l
was gay to get the job in the Jockey.

29:18.630 --> 29:24.471
No! l've seen the way you look at me!
We've touched. l know you liked it!

29:26.030 --> 29:29.231
l got om with a bloke two
nights ago in the Jockey.

29:33.470 --> 29:37.271
You must have tendencies. Maybe
you just haven't met the right woman.

29:37.311 --> 29:41.831
Maybe you're just trying to
be straight, because it's trendy.

29:41.870 --> 29:44.911
l'm sorry.

29:52.071 --> 29:54.071
Never would have worked anyway.

29:54.110 --> 29:57.111
Age gap. You being a Gemini.

30:00.550 --> 30:03.471
Lucky escape probably.

30:03.511 --> 30:05.871
No hard feelings then?

30:09.751 --> 30:12.711
Right. l might as well fuck om.

30:12.751 --> 30:16.471
Might catch the end
of Bad Girls if l'm lucky.

30:20.311 --> 30:22.551
(Sheila) Oh, hello. >

30:23.751 --> 30:26.671
Think. You're a 14-year-old boy.
Where are you gonna hide?

30:26.710 --> 30:29.391
You don't even know it were Carl.

30:29.431 --> 30:30.671
Who else you got in mind? Your boyfriend?

30:30.710 --> 30:33.231
He's not my boyfriend!

30:33.270 --> 30:35.351
Anyway, Jimmy fucking hates coppers.

30:35.390 --> 30:37.511
What about your other boyfriend?
Lip?

30:37.550 --> 30:39.631
Seems to me like Lip
got Carl to grass,

30:39.671 --> 30:42.791
cos you stopped him seeing Katie.
Is he after custody?

30:42.831 --> 30:44.991
Don't be stupid,
he wouldn't do that.

30:45.030 --> 30:46.231
Doesn't sound stupid to me.

30:46.270 --> 30:49.151
He wouldn't do it!
l know he wouldn't.

30:49.190 --> 30:51.791
Oh, yeah, and why are you so sure?

30:51.831 --> 30:55.071
Because he cares about me.

30:55.110 --> 30:57.111
''He cares about me.''
Pass the fucking sick bucket!

30:57.151 --> 31:00.471
He does! He's a better
man than any of you two.

31:00.511 --> 31:03.471
He's a better man than
anyone around here.

31:03.511 --> 31:07.951
Didn't you say Carl Gallagher's
hanging out with some girl?

31:11.911 --> 31:14.231
MOBILE PHONE BEEPS

31:29.751 --> 31:32.191
DOGS GROWL

31:41.071 --> 31:43.871
l'm too cold
and too cold and too cold

31:43.911 --> 31:46.671
l'm too old
and too bold and too bold

31:46.710 --> 31:49.391
And it shows
and it shows and it shows

31:49.431 --> 31:51.751
And you know and
you know and you know

31:51.790 --> 31:54.671
Sometimes, l hate myself...

31:54.710 --> 31:58.031
Carl, it's Chloe. You've gotta
get out of there! They're coming.

32:01.911 --> 32:04.271
Where is he? Let me at the
little fucking gobshite!

32:04.311 --> 32:06.311
What d'you think you're doing?!

32:06.350 --> 32:08.391

32:08.431 --> 32:09.791
(Mimi) Fucking tell me now!

32:09.831 --> 32:13.191
CARL! Carl, get out of there!

32:13.231 --> 32:17.031

Get down the fucking stairs.

32:28.911 --> 32:31.351

32:31.390 --> 32:34.311
For fuck's sake, Mimi

32:34.350 --> 32:35.591
Tell me where he is!

32:35.630 --> 32:36.231
He ain't fucking done nothing!

32:36.270 --> 32:37.471
Oh, no?!

32:37.511 --> 32:41.671
l hate to break up the hokey cokey,
but your Mandy's just been arrested.

32:43.710 --> 32:44.751

32:46.550 --> 32:48.951

32:51.470 --> 32:55.031
Fucking hell! Fucking hell, Carl!
What you playing at?!

32:55.071 --> 32:58.791
She dobbed me in. She told the
Maguires l was in the loft.

32:58.831 --> 33:01.151
Pass us the bog roll then.

33:07.511 --> 33:09.471
Can l finish me dump?

33:09.511 --> 33:12.271
Where the fuck is my Mandy?

33:12.311 --> 33:15.391
You better tell me what
you're charging her with

33:15.431 --> 33:18.111
and on what fucking evidence!

33:18.151 --> 33:19.871
Back up!

33:19.911 --> 33:21.631
Mimi! What the fuck you doing?!

33:21.671 --> 33:23.431

33:26.431 --> 33:29.391

- Fuck's sake, Mimi.

33:29.431 --> 33:30.231
< Back up.

33:30.270 --> 33:32.191
Look...
Just let me in to see her, will you?

33:32.231 --> 33:35.511
l'm the baby's dad. l've gotta take
her home anyway. l'm lan's brother.

33:35.550 --> 33:37.191
Come on, dickhead!

33:37.231 --> 33:39.031
Where's my daughter?

33:39.071 --> 33:42.231
Fuck om! Fuck om!

33:42.270 --> 33:46.071
lf she's gonna go round shopping your
mate, you're better om without her.

33:54.550 --> 33:55.551
l love her though.

33:55.591 --> 33:58.671
No you don't.
You just feel like you do.

33:58.710 --> 34:00.751
< l thought she were interested.

34:00.790 --> 34:03.791
l thought she liked me.

34:03.831 --> 34:06.471
You can't always tell, mate.

34:06.511 --> 34:08.871
So, how can you?

34:08.911 --> 34:11.871
l mean, tell if...

34:11.911 --> 34:13.591
a girl will let you shag her.

34:13.630 --> 34:16.911
l mean how...

34:16.949 --> 34:18.591
How do you get her to do it?

34:20.150 --> 34:21.951
l dunno!

34:21.991 --> 34:23.351
l don't think l've ever done it.

34:23.389 --> 34:27.391
Oh, no, l mean, obviously l've
''done it'', done it.

34:27.431 --> 34:30.271
Just never made the move, you know.

34:30.311 --> 34:33.591
The bird always does it...

34:33.630 --> 34:34.670
Fucking hell!

34:34.710 --> 34:38.511
So, is that how it works then?

34:38.550 --> 34:41.231
Look.
If she wants you,

34:41.270 --> 34:45.751
there's just no getting out of it,
cos women always get what they want.

34:45.790 --> 34:47.471
l mean, take Vee tonight, l took her

34:47.511 --> 34:49.150
down the rugby club for a stripogram.

34:49.190 --> 34:51.591
What she's after is wedge.
If some bloke wants to grope her

34:51.630 --> 34:54.630
tits for a tenner, she's
gonna go for it, isn't she?

34:56.311 --> 34:58.111
Oh, bloody hell!

35:00.671 --> 35:04.191
Look Carl, the bottom line
is, you'll just know, yeah.

35:04.231 --> 35:06.831
When the time's right,
it'll just kick in.

35:06.870 --> 35:10.431
And if it don't, then
she'll tell you, won't she?

35:10.470 --> 35:12.471
DOOR SLAMS

35:16.110 --> 35:18.431
Where's Katie?

35:18.470 --> 35:21.071
She's with the policewoman.

35:21.110 --> 35:22.111
l'm gonna take her home in a minute.

35:22.151 --> 35:25.351
Suppose you're fucking
happy, are you? Me in here.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.111
You with custody of Katie!

35:27.151 --> 35:28.751
No, Mandy, of course not!

35:28.790 --> 35:31.831
l'm here for you. To help you.
l could've taken Katie and gone.

35:31.870 --> 35:34.351
But l didn't. l'm here for you.

35:34.390 --> 35:36.351
- Was it Carl?
- No.

35:36.390 --> 35:38.471
They're talking time, Lip.

35:38.511 --> 35:42.111
They've got a statement
l was dealing

35:42.151 --> 35:45.311
and l'm old enough to go inside.
And that CID wanker out there!

35:45.350 --> 35:48.791
Stop it.
It's not gonna help is it, eh?

35:48.831 --> 35:52.431
Well, what the hell is?! l wanna
be with Katie! That's all l want.

35:52.470 --> 35:55.031
Just get me
out so l can be with Katie!

35:55.071 --> 35:58.911
Just get me out.
l just wanna be with Katie!

35:58.950 --> 36:00.391
Can't you get your
copper to do summat?

36:00.431 --> 36:04.631
You must be joking! He threatened to
arrest me if l asked another favour.

36:04.671 --> 36:05.831
You must be crap in bed.

36:05.870 --> 36:09.431
Yeah. Look, we need to work
out who made the statement.

36:09.470 --> 36:11.671
There's not that many
people it could be.

36:11.710 --> 36:14.431
What l don't understand is
why it make it about Mandy?

36:14.470 --> 36:15.631
l mean, all the Maguires do it.

36:15.671 --> 36:19.071
And who would send Mandy down
instead of that horrible Mimi?

36:21.470 --> 36:22.991
< What?

36:23.030 --> 36:24.951
Unless it's personal.

36:24.991 --> 36:26.951
They've pushed him out the business!

36:42.950 --> 36:45.911
- All right, Shane?
- What do you want, Gallagher?

36:45.950 --> 36:49.591
l know it
was you who grassed up your Mandy.

36:49.630 --> 36:51.031
You what?

36:51.071 --> 36:52.831
We can talk about it here or
l can go and tell your family.

36:52.870 --> 36:55.551
The fucking bitch!

36:55.591 --> 36:58.071
Who the fuck does she think she is?

36:58.110 --> 36:59.631
So what you telling me for?

36:59.671 --> 37:02.871
You know why. Cos they'd
have your balls for breaMast.

37:02.911 --> 37:05.231
And much as that'd entertain me,

37:05.270 --> 37:08.231
l want Katie to know there's
another way of doing things -

37:08.270 --> 37:10.111
the Gallagher way.

37:10.151 --> 37:12.351
So here's the deal.

37:12.390 --> 37:15.551
You retract your statement.
You tell your mum it wasn't Carl.

37:15.591 --> 37:18.591
And you stay away from Mandy.

37:18.630 --> 37:21.151
Or l promise you, l will tell 'em.

37:22.831 --> 37:24.431
Oh.

37:24.470 --> 37:27.991
You used to be a
plasterer, didn't you?

37:28.030 --> 37:30.711
l've got a ceiling wants doing.

37:30.751 --> 37:33.031
l won't be paying.

37:45.431 --> 37:47.391
All right?

37:52.470 --> 37:56.591
Look, l'm sorry about
telling the Maguires...

37:56.630 --> 37:58.031
Paid you, did they?

37:58.071 --> 37:59.311
20 quid.

38:01.870 --> 38:04.551
You don't look hurt.
l thought they wanted to thump you?

38:04.591 --> 38:07.271
l can handle myself.

38:07.311 --> 38:08.551
Look...

38:08.591 --> 38:14.751
l thought that if l rang you straight after, that l
could have the money and you'd be all right.

38:18.311 --> 38:19.831
l can give you half of it?

38:19.870 --> 38:21.591
l don't want it.

38:31.071 --> 38:33.071
ls there anything that you do want?

38:52.870 --> 38:54.351
Do you want to?

39:07.591 --> 39:09.511
Come here, you.

39:23.991 --> 39:25.591
Fuck om. >

39:33.911 --> 39:36.711
(Frank) It's more a sort of Tweety Pie
going on, innit Margaret...

39:36.751 --> 39:38.071
And you can give us a kiss, and all.

39:38.110 --> 39:41.311
Eh? l could be Sylvester to your
Tweety Pie after whatsit.

39:47.630 --> 39:50.151
Oh, come on Sheila, love.

39:50.190 --> 39:55.351
Hey, you never know, our Delia
might turn out to be a lezzer.

39:56.911 --> 39:59.511
Do you really think so?

39:59.550 --> 40:02.791
Yeah, well l've never
seen her suck her thumb.

40:02.831 --> 40:04.231
Oh!

40:06.431 --> 40:08.951
So you're really not gonna
tell me who it was then?

40:08.991 --> 40:12.191
l think the word you're looking for
is ''thank you''.

40:12.231 --> 40:15.271
That's two words, innit?

40:16.991 --> 40:19.111
Well, go on! Tell me then!

40:19.151 --> 40:22.591
Why d'you go to such
heroic lengths to get me out?

40:22.630 --> 40:23.551
l told you, didn't l?

40:23.591 --> 40:26.231
What, cos you can't live without me?

40:26.270 --> 40:28.871
You're a fucking nightmare, you are.

40:30.671 --> 40:34.711
l'm scared to say anything
in case you take my head om.

40:34.751 --> 40:38.871
Ooh, sensitive flower!

40:38.911 --> 40:41.271
l was only joking.

40:44.030 --> 40:46.791
What's the deal with Jimmy then?

40:46.831 --> 40:48.111
What d'you mean?

40:48.151 --> 40:49.991
l mean...

40:50.030 --> 40:51.271
You know, are you...

40:51.311 --> 40:52.951
You are jealous, aren't you?

40:52.991 --> 40:55.791
l've got feelings for you, Mandy.

40:58.390 --> 41:00.471
l won't be settled for, Lip.

41:00.511 --> 41:02.871
So don't say it if
it's just about Katie.

41:02.911 --> 41:05.631
You know it's not.

41:05.671 --> 41:07.831
We've done this all
in the wrong order.

41:07.870 --> 41:12.471
Kid first, then work
out we fancy each other!

41:13.390 --> 41:18.071
Yes or no, Mandy?
Last time l'm asking. Me and you.

41:18.110 --> 41:20.471
D'you wanna give this a go or not?

41:23.431 --> 41:25.951
You're such
a fucking pain in the arse!
