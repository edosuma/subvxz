WEBVTT

00:25.693 --> 00:29.194
And as such this episode of
"Permanent Residents" comes to an end.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.531
We hope you've enjoyed it and can now
make your own mental picture of Brazil.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.701
As you all know by now we don't
just visit countries: we live there,

00:35.703 --> 00:37.836
immersing ourselves
deep into the culture

00:37.838 --> 00:40.539
and making bonds with people
who are sometimes indefectible.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.809
Our next trip will take us to
the mythical city of Casablanca,

00:43.811 --> 00:46.412
home of the legendary
Rick's Café.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.680
Helen, are you okay?

00:50.084 --> 00:51.683
Wait, wait here.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.567
This is fucking awesome!

01:16.210 --> 01:18.110
This little fucker is fast.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.088
I hate that I have to be so rough with
you, baby, I really do.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.090
But there's nothing else
I can do.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.876
Give me the phone.
What are you doing?

01:50.878 --> 01:54.246
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Put down the knife and give me the phone.

01:54.248 --> 01:57.382
Jesus! Calm down!
Do you speak English?

01:57.384 --> 02:00.185
Dude, stop it.
Do you speak English? English?

02:00.187 --> 02:01.620
Calm down and give me the phone.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.355
Is this your-- is this your son?

02:08.362 --> 02:10.395
He stole my partner's phone.

02:10.396 --> 02:11.930
Can I get the phone back,
please?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.134
That's just the camera guy.
Don't worry about him.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.301
My present.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.536
- What?
- My present.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.238
I think he wants the camera.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.873
- Give it to him.
- He's not getting my camera.

02:20.875 --> 02:23.308
- This guy's not kidding, man.
- Neither am I.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.210
- I'm not giving him my camera.
- Give him the fucking camera.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.412
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

02:28.616 --> 02:29.982
Don't fuck with me right now.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.349
I'll break your fucking legs.
Give him the camera!

02:34.622 --> 02:35.487
Give him the fucking camera.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.689
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

02:44.532 --> 02:46.899
- You guys get out of here.
- Just be careful.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.867
- Just get the fuck out of here.
- Careful with it.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.570
Get out what here?

02:57.311 --> 02:58.277
Okay, look.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.244
I just need to get
that memory card back.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.317
I need the SD card back.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.690
It has all my work on it.
It's how I make a living.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.458
Me and the other two guys.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.473
- You okay?
- Not really.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.408
Why what's up?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.643
The numbers are down.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.545
What are we at?

04:40.547 --> 04:43.949
- 1.2 million views.
- That's pretty good.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.084
What? Viral is a million.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.289
That's twenty-six percent lower
than our South African episode.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.791
Don't worry. Morocco is gonna be
good. It's gonna be kick-ass.

04:54.028 --> 04:56.428
- The audience just wants more.
- More what?

04:56.430 --> 04:57.929
We almost died
three times in Brazil.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.399
Maybe they want to see us die.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.835
I can't stand it
when you think like that, Einar.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.105
I think the audience just wants
to root for us more.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.842
I think they want to be able to
see through us more, you know.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.878
Maybe we just haven't shown them
who we really are.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.047
Like Einar jerking off
in the middle of the night?

05:15.983 --> 05:19.785
Or you filming yourself taking a
piss, realizing you have no dick?

05:19.787 --> 05:21.787
Exactly, guys.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.822
Oh fuck you, buddy.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.358
- Oh, fuck you!
- No, fuck you.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.528
- Wait! Do you have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.463
How could you run off
filming that take

05:31.465 --> 05:34.633
- when Helen was on the ground?
- I checked. She was fine.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.601
- She was on the ground, hurt.
- I know.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.337
- You checked?
- I checked. She was fine.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.072
- I checked.
- Yes, then I ran.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.774
- Selfish motherfucker.
- Wait, what? What did you say?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.910
Motherfucker. Do you want
me to spell it out for you?

05:44.912 --> 05:48.980
- I would love it if you did.
- Helen, please.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.816
Can you keep this guy
away from me?

05:50.818 --> 05:52.584
Turn around
and mind your business.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.586
- ...E-R.
- Can you just keep away from me?

05:54.588 --> 05:56.588
- Can you?
- What are you doing?

05:56.590 --> 05:58.423
- Einar?
- What am I doing?

05:58.425 --> 06:00.525
I'm confiscating
your penis extension.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.160
- Uh, that's...
- Hey, driver.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.763
- Could you open the window?
- Gentlemen.

06:04.765 --> 06:08.500
What are you doing?
What are you doing? I got it.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.569
- Einar.
- Okay, just give it back.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.451
Is this the-- is this the place?

06:59.453 --> 07:00.852
I'm so hungry.
You guys starving?

07:00.854 --> 07:03.155
I would kill
for a cup of coffee.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.823
Kill for a cup of coffee?

07:04.825 --> 07:07.426
Do you mean like literally
murder somebody?

07:07.428 --> 07:08.794
I'd murder you
for a cup of coffee.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.429
That's very rude.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.731
I expect an apology
like right now.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.767
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.936
When was the first time
you did crack?

07:18.939 --> 07:22.474
Hi.
"Permanent Residents," Helen.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.576
- Mrs. Frangier.
- Come in, dear.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.579
- Come in, all of you.
- Thank you.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.048
- Hello, hello.
- Hi.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.118
This is awesome.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.053
How many cats
are around here?

07:37.758 --> 07:41.159
Helen, you look
exactly like in your program.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.662
- You watch our show?
- Of course.

07:43.664 --> 07:47.265
That episode in Guatemala,
where you got abducted by these drug lords

07:47.267 --> 07:49.534
- was so uplifting.
- Thank you.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.770
- Did you rate us?
- Sorry?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.004
Did you write a good comment?

07:53.006 --> 07:55.540
- Oh yes, always.
- Awesome.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.909
Come in, dear.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.244
Come in all of you.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.280
- Welcome.
- Wow!

08:02.282 --> 08:05.917
- This place is awesome, Mrs. Frangier.
- Thank you.

08:05.919 --> 08:09.054
- Your Airbnb didn't lie.
- Why would it?

08:09.056 --> 08:12.557
Sometimes people like to make their
houses look better than in real life.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.995
Helen.
Oh, I love the banister.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.967
I love the pendant you're wearing.
Where did you get it?

08:21.969 --> 08:25.537
- A cabbalist gave it to me on a trip to Chile.
- What's inside?

08:26.206 --> 08:29.307
Writings to protect
from evil spirits.

08:29.309 --> 08:34.044
- You believe in spirits?
- So, why so cheap?

08:34.047 --> 08:38.650
Ah, Daniel liked the house
being filled with life.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.186
- Who's Daniel?
- My son.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.657
Oh, yeah,
this is my room.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.792
Definitely, a panic room.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.730
The poor woman went
cuckoo after her husband passed away.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.933
Don't be alarmed if she pops in
once in a while.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.835
She is totally harmless.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.703
What did you say her name was?

08:58.705 --> 09:02.040
Mancherbruuk.
Her name is Mancherbruuk.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.343
You can't miss her.
Her hell is contagious.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.312
Oh what is this?

09:08.315 --> 09:11.082
What is that broken frame?

09:11.084 --> 09:12.951
All right.

09:12.953 --> 09:17.589
Oh, ooh! I look so good,
don't you think?

09:17.591 --> 09:19.658
You look awesome.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.760
Mm.

09:26.133 --> 09:29.668
What is this? A little foursome?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.269
That's fun.

09:42.783 --> 09:46.351
New room, new stuff.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.053
Why are flies here?

09:49.289 --> 09:51.756
One, two, three.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.598
Come on, head,
pop up to me, will you?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.600
Don't be afraid to be cliché.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.935
Come on,
jump scares always work.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.272
What the hell is that thing?

10:13.313 --> 10:16.147
I got a miniature plant.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.983
Oh, this is so cool.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.986
Danger sign.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.321
Something I can help you with,
young man?

10:23.323 --> 10:24.956
Um... What's in there?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.891
Ah, the motor room.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.995
I had a little problem
with the electricity company.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.363
Oh, I see.

10:31.365 --> 10:34.165
You remind me of him a little.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.701
You remind me of my son, Daniel.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.037
You must have
a very beautiful soul.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.172
I don't know. All I really
checked was my bladder.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.241
You're so cute.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.077
You're cute, too.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.979
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.882
Well, boys. I leave you here.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.251
I wish you a beautiful stay.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.854
Anything you need
my number is on the fridge.

10:55.856 --> 10:56.988
Thank you.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.292
I am very happy
to have all of you here.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.895
I really am.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.667
Uh, I can't stand the sound
of that motor.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.775
Have you ever made out
with a sixty-year-old before?

11:18.378 --> 11:21.246
- No.
- 'Cause I almost did

11:21.248 --> 11:25.050
and I have a feeling it would
have been awesome. So...

11:26.353 --> 11:29.854
- Okay.
- Maybe we should put you in there.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.924
What's? What? So rude.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.836
You want a reaction shot
of me like closing this?

12:17.838 --> 12:21.106
- Mm-hm.
- Okay. All right.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.175
Here we are standing outside
of the old slaughterhouse.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.845
Another example of the strong
heritage left behind

12:26.847 --> 12:28.446
by the French
colonization period.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.482
You can also notice
the architecture

12:30.484 --> 12:32.484
is reminiscent
of the Art Deco movement

12:32.486 --> 12:36.020
with vertical lines, abstract
shapes, and high moldings.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.058
If you take a look around,
you can also see the place is a ghost town

12:40.060 --> 12:42.393
and that's because of the
mysterious superstitious beliefs

12:42.395 --> 12:44.796
held by the people
of Casablanca.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.532
We're gonna take you inside and find
out what people are so afraid of.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.300
So follow me
and let's go take a look.

12:56.910 --> 13:00.245
- Hey, what?
- Sir, we have...

13:03.884 --> 13:05.884
Oh, and here's
another police truck.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.053
God, it seems like everywhere
we go, they--

13:09.923 --> 13:15.160
these people are always present
for some obscure reason.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.595
I know.
Just very, very reassuring.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.500
Very reassuring.
What's up? You, okay?

13:23.370 --> 13:25.170
I have a bad feeling
about this city.

13:26.106 --> 13:29.274
We were shooting without a permit.
It could have happened anywhere.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.510
- No, it's not
the slaughter house incident. -What then?

13:34.281 --> 13:37.816
Just getting bad vibes.
Bad omen.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.285
- Hello.
- It's real.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.619
Oh, wow.
What do you got there?

13:44.124 --> 13:46.558
- I like the purple.
- A very nice color.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.159
- Can I see this?
- Yes. Yes.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.362
Awesome. Thank you.

13:51.364 --> 13:56.401
Wow. I like this. How much?

13:56.403 --> 13:59.404
- Three hundred.
- Uh, three hundred?

14:00.473 --> 14:02.473
Uh, how about two hundred?

14:02.475 --> 14:04.008
- Two?
- Two hundred.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.844
- It's okay.
- All right.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.912
I can do that.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.614
- Thanks.
- Bye.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.317
- Wait. How much?
- Two hundred dirhams.

14:12.319 --> 14:16.221
He said three hundred but he
gave it to me for two hundred.

14:16.223 --> 14:19.257
- It's like twenty dollars.
- I don't remember the conversion.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.526
It's like ten dollars is--

14:21.528 --> 14:24.662
No ten dirhams
is one dollar, so...

14:24.664 --> 14:26.531
He said @@
is what you should pay.

14:27.601 --> 14:30.635
You better read up.
Get a guide next time you shop.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.071
Fifteen dirhams?
Oh my God! Thank you.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.540
- I knew it.
- We should thank him.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.570
We just got invited
to a wedding.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.274
- Awesome.
- You got invited to a wedding.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.377
No. You, Mark and I.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.146
That's ridiculous.
You didn't even know the guy.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.415
Well,
he just saved me 200 dirhams.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.384
- Seems like a nice guy.
- Well, 150.

15:19.386 --> 15:22.487
That's like the beginning
of a horror movie or something.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.460
Silence
is all there is right now.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.666
The moonlight barely touches
the clay walls in here.

15:36.169 --> 15:39.604
Helen is upstairs
making herself look pretty.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.473
And Einar
is masturbating insatiably.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.444
So, where does that leave me?

15:50.984 --> 15:53.584
You want a little back-story
on Mark Dole.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.119
I am Mark Dole.

15:55.121 --> 16:00.491
Am I meant to do this permanent
resident stuff for the rest of my life

16:00.493 --> 16:03.561
or am I meant to be
an actual filmmaker?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.665
I don't know.

16:09.602 --> 16:13.304
I don't know.
Maybe I'm meant to lose.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.510
You know in the end,
everyone loses.

16:19.512 --> 16:23.047
- Mark.
- Oh, hey. In here.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.283
- You ready?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.118
- We better get going.
- Wow! You look--

16:27.120 --> 16:30.188
You look really beautiful.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.024
- You like?
- Yeah, just stunning.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.193
- Thank you.
- Wow!

16:35.195 --> 16:37.495
- I wore this just for you.
- Did you?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.464
- I did.
- Really? No way.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.166
Well, how do you know
I love purple?

16:42.168 --> 16:44.202
- Man, tattoos.
- Well, I took a wild guess.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.637
- You like that?
- The tattoos? I do.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.439
Right on.

16:48.441 --> 16:51.442
- Ready to have some fun tonight?
- Yes, yes, yes.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.311
- Like that?
- Oh, boob shot.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.013
- You got a zoom shot?
- Oh perfect.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.447
- Zooming in the zone.
- Here one more.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.349
- Oh, here we go.
- Get that close up.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.118
- I know you want it.
- I do.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.652
- There we go.
- Well, if you come out,

17:01.654 --> 17:04.188
we can dance
may be naked tonight.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.656
- Oh! Okay.
- Hey!

17:11.330 --> 17:12.363
I'll be outside.

17:14.334 --> 17:18.502
- Come on, Mark, let's go.
- Oh... Okay. Oh...

17:21.307 --> 17:24.342
Wow! That is officially weird.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.316
Finally a night out.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.552
- That's gonna be awesome.
- Yeah.

17:35.522 --> 17:39.090
Yeah. It's nice to actually
get to see the city, you know.

17:39.092 --> 17:43.261
Yeah, just do something
fun rather than, you know...

17:43.263 --> 17:46.364
- Sit around and jerk off whole day?
- Yeah. Wait.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.067
Some of us
actually try to work.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.235
True.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.505
Yeah, this is a beautiful city.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.442
- So sweet.
- Thank you so much.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.579
It's nothing.
It's really my pleasure.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.283
So how long
have you been a guide?

18:06.386 --> 18:07.485
Thirty-one years.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.721
I started
when I was nine years old.

18:11.891 --> 18:16.527
Yeah, as a kid my parents
could not afford school.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.695
So I had to work.

18:17.697 --> 18:22.800
I would walk to the main square,
walk up to people,

18:22.802 --> 18:25.570
offer to take them places.

18:25.572 --> 18:29.340
I really started enjoying it.
You know,

18:29.342 --> 18:33.744
the exchange with people,
the encounters, it became my life.

18:34.848 --> 18:37.515
How about you?
How did you all become vloggers?

18:38.685 --> 18:41.486
- That's a really long story.
- Oh yeah!

18:41.488 --> 18:45.323
It's actually only temporary
or I mean for me at least.

18:46.392 --> 18:49.293
- Oh really? How's that?
- I'm gonna make movies.

18:51.164 --> 18:54.732
- Movies? As in Hollywood movies?
- I'm in Nahor.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.268
I'm gonna make the ultimate
found-footage horror flick.

18:57.270 --> 19:01.839
- It's gonna be awesome.
- What's found-footage?

19:01.841 --> 19:06.244
It means the filmmakers die and the footage
is found. It's really an overused genre.

19:06.246 --> 19:10.248
Okay, you're jealous because I
actually have a passion and you don't.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.417
I don't need a passion, okay?
I need money.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.820
And so do you in case you forgot
your eviction notice.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.223
Can we not do this right now?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.327
Never mind them.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.263
They're in love.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.365
They just don't know it yet.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.267
Totally.

19:39.746 --> 19:43.181
- So, how far is this wedding?
- We will be there soon.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.752
- Soon as in how soon?
- About fifteen minutes.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.958
- You said that 15 minutes ago.
- Sorry?

19:53.960 --> 19:56.761
I said, you said 15 minutes
15 minutes ago.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.796
We've been on the road
for like half an hour.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.634
As you can see there's
a lot of traffic today.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.904
- Stop the fucking car.
- Why are you doing this?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.606
Ha, ha, ha,
you think this is a joke?

20:42.775 --> 20:46.310
- Stop. What are you doing?
- Get out of the car.

20:46.312 --> 20:49.513
Get out of the fucking car, now. Come
on stop being so naive. This is a setup.

20:49.515 --> 20:52.984
- What's wrong with you my friend?
- Get the fuck back in the car.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.653
- Who are the organs for, huh?
- Einar, calm down!

20:55.655 --> 20:58.656
- You trust this guy?
- Dude, just calm down.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.392
- Do you have a gun?
- Why are you acting like an asshole? Calm down.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.794
I have no guns. Let me show you.
Let me show you.

21:03.796 --> 21:07.598
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Just my guide card.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.268
Let me show you
my guide card, okay?

21:11.304 --> 21:13.504
- Say again?
- You can see it's real.

21:13.506 --> 21:17.608
- You're really a fucking guide?
- Yeah, I told you before.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.812
- Okay, my friend.
- Einar, calm down, man.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.481
You need to calm
the fuck down, all right?

21:23.483 --> 21:25.916
Oh me, I'm okay.
Is he okay, your friend?

21:25.918 --> 21:27.818
- I don't know.
- I don't hear you.

21:29.822 --> 21:34.692
- Apologize to him.
- Okay. It's no problem. No problem.

21:34.694 --> 21:37.395
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Okay. It's okay.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.064
- You need to see a doctor.
- What else do you want me to do? Suck his dick?

21:40.066 --> 21:42.500
No, I want you to get
some fucking help. You're sick.

21:42.502 --> 21:45.036
Please get in the car. We're gonna
be late for my niece's wedding.

21:45.038 --> 21:46.937
Okay, it's no problem.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.506
Okay. It's okay.

23:50.229 --> 23:53.764
- Still nothing?
- No. Still dark.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.966
Fuck! How is that possible?

23:55.968 --> 23:59.470
You tell me. You're the one
handling the camera.

23:59.472 --> 24:03.808
I already told you the image
distorted, the LEDs went crazy.

24:03.810 --> 24:08.045
Oh and it burned my hand.
Do you think that's bad?

24:08.848 --> 24:13.250
Bad, no. I think it's great. I mean, we
don't have a picture but that's just fine.

24:13.252 --> 24:17.521
At least we have sound. We can use that on the--
you know air that on the radio or something.

24:17.523 --> 24:20.224
Dude, you're acting like
it's my fault it even happened.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.993
I told you I dropped it
because the camera got hot.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.663
Well just try it again.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.699
I tried twelve times already.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.536
Oh that's nice.

24:32.538 --> 24:34.171
Are you fucking watching
porn right now?

24:34.173 --> 24:36.173
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Wait! Dude.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.576
- It's working.
- What? Are you serious?

24:38.578 --> 24:40.511
- Yeah.
- I told you. Told you...

24:40.513 --> 24:42.046
Fucked up.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.682
What was that?

24:44.684 --> 24:47.785
It's Helen. I think she's sick.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.554
Helen.

24:57.630 --> 24:58.863
Helen!

25:03.002 --> 25:04.301
Are you okay?

25:24.790 --> 25:26.590
What's going on Einar?

25:26.592 --> 25:29.193
You're not as jovial
as you usually are.

25:30.096 --> 25:32.129
Mark, I checked
the Office of Tourism.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.798
There is no Tareek Kaleem
listed as a tour guide.

25:36.135 --> 25:40.304
Oh, okay. So just because he's
not listed as an official tour guide

25:40.306 --> 25:42.540
doesn't mean
he's not a tour guide.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.910
I mean it's freelance work.
It's kind of like what we do.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.579
Kind of do our own thing.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.249
And what's the problem?

25:57.790 --> 25:58.889
I'm ready, guys.

26:00.793 --> 26:04.828
Here we are standing outside the second
largest mosque in the world, Hassan II.

26:05.998 --> 26:10.367
This is the large-- this is-- All right,
guys, you rolling? Let's do this for real.

26:11.370 --> 26:14.004
- Are you ready?
- Here we are standing outside

26:14.006 --> 26:15.873
the second largest mosque
in the world,

26:15.875 --> 26:18.142
Hassan II.
This is a major day of worship

26:18.144 --> 26:21.345
on Fridays
for the predominantly new--

26:21.347 --> 26:23.280
Cut let's do that again.

26:23.282 --> 26:24.582
Here we are standing out--

26:27.620 --> 26:28.385
Mom.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.054
Oh, no.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.622
She's on the phone
with her mom.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.191
I sent you money before I left.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.963
She is not happy.

26:39.765 --> 26:44.068
Yeah, mom.
Are you drinking again?

26:44.937 --> 26:49.306
I would have given you a little
more back-story on Einar but it's--

26:49.308 --> 26:53.210
it's pretty blue, pretty sad.
Hey, man! What's up? You okay?

26:57.383 --> 26:58.749
What the fuck?

27:05.358 --> 27:07.391
Crazy fucking bitch!

27:07.393 --> 27:09.360
What's going on?
Talk to me, man.

27:10.296 --> 27:13.430
It's-- it's just a nosebleed.
That's it.

27:13.432 --> 27:17.668
It could be the climate change.
The jet lag. I don't know.

27:22.842 --> 27:26.443
Fuck you, Mom!
You fucking bitch.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.312
You stupid fucking whore.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.982
You're the fucking whore, Mom.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.053
Me, I just like fucking pussy.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.170
Helen, where's your necklace?

28:29.241 --> 28:30.741
I must have dropped it.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.441
Could you stop filming
for one second?

29:04.443 --> 29:08.278
No, no,
this anger is like perfect.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.483
You need to listen to this.

29:12.485 --> 29:15.786
- What is this?
- I got it translated.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.167
What is that?

29:30.169 --> 29:34.505
That Arabic she's speaking.
That's not just plain Arabic.

29:36.175 --> 29:39.209
That's an ancient dialect
spoken by mythological figures

29:39.211 --> 29:42.112
during the Arabic crusade
against the Christian invasion.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.782
So, what are you saying?

29:44.784 --> 29:46.784
I'm saying,
the language she's speaking,

29:48.087 --> 29:49.953
it's the language
of the Jinn.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.822
Oh, what is the Jinn?

29:53.259 --> 29:56.994
It's the Arab word for demon.

29:56.996 --> 30:00.931
Okay. So you're saying that woman
we hear speaking in the background

30:00.933 --> 30:02.466
is actually invoking demons?

30:02.468 --> 30:06.036
Not just any demon; the demon.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.372
Oh! That was good.
That was good.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.241
Okay, can we step back and do
it again, I think we could...

30:11.243 --> 30:13.844
- Do you think it's a joke?
- No.

30:13.846 --> 30:16.580
I think you should take a shower
and drink some milk.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.582
Find all the milk you can
and just drink it

30:18.584 --> 30:22.519
because this hashish you're on
right now, it's a lot.

30:22.521 --> 30:25.155
You're a little much.
It's gonna work great.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.892
It's gonna work great
with this but um, I'm gonna go.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.994
I'm telling you,
don't go up there.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.574
Good morning, sweetheart.
How'd you sleep?

31:52.945 --> 31:56.647
I slept fine.
Thanks for asking. And you?

31:58.484 --> 32:02.185
Slept good. Slept good.

32:15.634 --> 32:16.667
What is this?

32:20.005 --> 32:23.941
"Not able to get Tareek on
phone. This is freaking me out.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.709
Going to town.
Be back soon. Einar."

32:25.711 --> 32:29.746
Okay, looks like Einar went
on another paranoia spree.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.415
That was to be expected.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.417
What is this?

33:11.090 --> 33:12.022
Shit!

33:27.272 --> 33:29.239
Oh my god! Oh my god!

33:29.241 --> 33:31.208
What the fuck? Mark.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.043
Mark, are you okay?

33:33.045 --> 33:34.411
- Wake up. Are you okay?
- What?

33:34.413 --> 33:35.812
- What happened?
- I don't know.

33:35.814 --> 33:38.281
You're lying in blood.
Get up.

33:38.283 --> 33:40.817
- Whose fucking blood is this?
- I don't know.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.120
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I don't know!

33:43.122 --> 33:44.654
I just woke up! I don't know!

33:44.656 --> 33:46.390
- Helen!
- Oh my god.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.291
- Helen!
- What the fuck are you doing?

33:48.293 --> 33:51.728
Where are you going?
Oh my god. I don't-- oh fuck!

33:51.730 --> 33:53.363
- Where is Helen?
- I don't know.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.499
What the fuck
did you do to Helen?

33:55.501 --> 33:57.167
Oh god! You're an asshole.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.469
- I'm the asshole?
- Shit!

33:59.471 --> 34:03.273
Oh my god! Is that like a--
did you punch me?

34:03.275 --> 34:07.344
- Oh! Was that a slap? God! Oh!
- Fuck!

34:07.346 --> 34:09.346
The battery is dead.
We got to recharge it.

34:09.348 --> 34:12.516
- Son of a bitch, Einar. Fuck!
- Fuck!

34:12.518 --> 34:15.719
What the fuck is going on?
What the fuck?

34:17.222 --> 34:19.456
Oh shit! Um...

34:19.458 --> 34:23.326
Hey, Einar,
can I get my camera back?

34:23.328 --> 34:26.696
We've got some blood up here,
I'd like to film. Come on.

34:26.697 --> 34:31.435
Ah! Einar,
do you have my camera?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.145
- She's still in the house.
- Really?

34:43.415 --> 34:45.715
- We'll talk to her.
- No, no. Wait. Just wait.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.784
What are you doing? No. she's
bathing in her own period blood.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.687
- We gotta clean her up.
- No. It's not her period.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.556
No, it is.
I'm going to go clean--

34:52.558 --> 34:55.891
- Can you sit down for one moment?
- Okay, fine.

34:55.893 --> 34:58.228
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

35:00.766 --> 35:04.301
- What?
- Remember that case I told you about?

35:04.303 --> 35:06.470
About the mass hysteria
that happened in our school

35:06.472 --> 35:09.639
- that me and Helen went to?
- Yeah.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.775
That wasn't a case
of mass hysteria.

35:13.178 --> 35:16.313
That was a case
of mass demonic possession.

35:17.483 --> 35:22.152
It was the first ever recorded mass
demonic possession involving children.

35:22.154 --> 35:25.655
- What are you talking about?
- There was this guy, Michael Winkler.

35:25.657 --> 35:29.426
He was a para-psychologist
who was investigating the case.

35:30.429 --> 35:33.363
He found out that kids
were playing this game

35:33.365 --> 35:36.466
that invoked demonic spirits.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.936
Twenty children ended up
in the hospital, Mark.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.840
Only eight of them got affected

35:44.943 --> 35:47.244
but Helen was one
of those eight children.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.347
So now you're keeping
secrets from me?

35:50.349 --> 35:51.882
I couldn't.
I couldn't tell you before.

35:51.884 --> 35:54.484
There was this intense pressure

35:54.486 --> 35:56.887
from the church,
from everybody involved.

35:56.889 --> 35:59.656
We all swore to secrecy, okay.

35:59.658 --> 36:03.193
We promised
that we wouldn't talk about it.

36:03.195 --> 36:06.363
I promised. I promised Helen.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.465
- Really?
- Yes.

36:08.467 --> 36:12.636
- And why are you telling me now?
- I'm telling you now because...

36:14.773 --> 36:18.542
Helen is possessed, Mark.

36:18.544 --> 36:21.878
That's not a wedding.
That's satanic ritual.

36:24.249 --> 36:27.484
- Bullshit!
- This is not something you want to see.

36:27.486 --> 36:29.653
- Shut the fuck up.
- This...

36:45.504 --> 36:47.771
Right there, stop. Rewind.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.374
Go back a few frames.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.009
Wait, zoom in.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.512
There, right there.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.214
Oh shit!

37:07.926 --> 37:11.361
Mark, I know you're there @@.

37:14.733 --> 37:18.435
Marky, boy. I know
you wanna fuck me. Come on.

37:33.885 --> 37:37.287
Run, run!

37:39.591 --> 37:43.026
We need to fucking hide.
We need to hide. Come on.

37:43.028 --> 37:44.861
So?

37:44.863 --> 37:46.429
What the hell?

38:03.515 --> 38:05.048
Okay. I think she's gone.

38:07.552 --> 38:10.687
You know how in those
found-footage movies

38:10.689 --> 38:14.758
they always get the camera and face
it to the actors for no reason?

38:14.760 --> 38:17.961
Yeah why?
I just did that.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.330
What do you think?

38:20.332 --> 38:23.533
Found-footage is dead, okay.
I already told you.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.335
We got a real problem here.

38:25.337 --> 38:26.870
- Okay.
- Helen is possessed.

38:27.773 --> 38:29.406
We just need to figure out
what to do.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.041
This is bad. This is bad.

38:31.043 --> 38:33.810
This is a bad demon.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.378
This is not good.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.982
This is a bad demon.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.584
How did we get into this?

38:41.586 --> 38:44.020
You know I'm starting to think

38:44.022 --> 38:46.723
that guy wasn't
that crazy after all.

38:46.725 --> 38:50.126
- What are you talking about?
- I didn't tell you?

38:50.128 --> 38:53.396
- No.
- While I was out there looking for Tareek,

38:54.333 --> 38:56.933
this guy was on the street,

38:56.935 --> 39:00.136
dancing like a lunatic,
screaming,

39:00.138 --> 39:03.807
singing this eerie song.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.710
I didn't understand it but then
this lady translated it.

39:08.613 --> 39:13.750
It was saying things
about this place, Booyah.

39:13.752 --> 39:18.121
He was saying it's like
a prison with no bars--

39:18.123 --> 39:22.025
like people
don't want to escape.

39:22.961 --> 39:26.062
Like there are not gates
but no one ever escapes.

39:26.064 --> 39:30.033
He was saying the possessed are
everywhere roaming the streets at night

39:30.035 --> 39:34.137
and the government will
find you and will grab you

39:34.139 --> 39:37.841
and throw you into Booyah
if you get possessed I mean.

39:39.444 --> 39:43.546
Wait a second. You're saying
that this Booyah place is real?

39:43.548 --> 39:46.916
Is a real place?
You know, like Area 51?

39:46.918 --> 39:50.720
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying
what this guy was singing about.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.489
Jeez.

39:52.491 --> 39:56.393
Look, we got this. Okay.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.061
Look at me. We got this.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.096
- We got this. You got this.
- We got this.

40:04.603 --> 40:07.170
- Dude, I told you, don't go in.
- I'm gonna be fine.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.707
- Be careful.
- Okay.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.988
I don't know. She must
have jumped out of the window.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.423
This can't be.

40:26.425 --> 40:29.225
Mark, step out of the bathroom

40:29.227 --> 40:32.128
really, really slowly.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.608
Mark!

41:30.856 --> 41:32.822
Come on, man!

41:38.196 --> 41:40.029
- Ah!
- Are you okay?

41:50.675 --> 41:54.143
Come on. Come on, come on.
Don't die on me. Please don't die on me.

41:54.145 --> 41:57.514
Please. Please, don't die on me.
Oh, come on.

41:57.516 --> 41:59.782
- Fuck!
- What?

41:59.784 --> 42:01.818
I'm trying to bring her
back to life.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.854
My camera.
I'm nothing without my camera.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.090
- Mark, look at me.
- No.

42:07.092 --> 42:08.558
- Look at me.
- No.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.792
- Look at me.
- No.

42:09.794 --> 42:11.928
I'm not looking at you.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.931
Mark, Helen is possessed.

42:14.933 --> 42:20.803
Look at me. Possession
as in horror movies. Understand?

42:20.805 --> 42:22.639
We're gonna wake up
from this soon, right?

42:22.641 --> 42:24.641
This is just one nightmare,
I'm gonna wake up.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.709
You're, she and the camera
are going to wake up

42:26.711 --> 42:28.645
and everything's gonna be fine.

42:28.647 --> 42:30.213
We need to call Frangier,
the embassy.

42:30.215 --> 42:33.049
- We need to call people.
- Listen to me.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.552
Listen to me.
We can't call anybody.

42:35.554 --> 42:38.621
The minute we call somebody,
they'll come here, grab Helen

42:38.623 --> 42:41.224
and throw her into Booyah
for the rest of her life.

42:41.226 --> 42:42.759
Booyah doesn't exist, man.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.794
You bet your life on it. Huh?

42:44.796 --> 42:49.299
The government has night
brigades patrolling the streets,

42:49.301 --> 42:51.634
looking for possessed people.
Okay?

42:51.636 --> 42:54.270
They're going to come here.
They're going to find Helen

42:54.272 --> 42:57.807
and they're going to throw her
in that godforsaken place

42:57.809 --> 43:00.376
for the rest of her fucking
life. Is that what you want?

43:00.378 --> 43:02.312
Huh? Is that what you want?

43:02.314 --> 43:06.082
What? What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

43:06.084 --> 43:11.721
I don't know. Just let me think.
Let me think.

43:14.926 --> 43:18.294
Okay. Okay, I got it.

43:18.296 --> 43:21.331
You've seen every single
possession movie there is, right?

43:21.333 --> 43:23.633
- Why? Why this...
- Just answer my question.

43:23.635 --> 43:27.070
I don't know. I think I missed
some of the Serbian ones.

43:27.072 --> 43:29.105
I don't know. Why?

43:30.141 --> 43:31.874
No.

43:31.876 --> 43:34.410
No. Einar we are not doing that.

43:34.412 --> 43:36.145
No.

43:37.115 --> 43:39.015
Shit. Shit.

43:46.758 --> 43:49.258
- What do you think?
- I think it'll work.

43:49.260 --> 43:51.694
- What else?
- Um, boiling water.

43:51.696 --> 43:53.129
- Got it.
- Salt?

43:53.131 --> 43:55.264
- Yes, salt.
- Cool. I think that's it.

43:55.266 --> 43:56.399
What about a spell?

43:56.401 --> 43:58.401
Oh, yeah, just say like,

43:58.403 --> 44:00.403
"The power of Christ compels
you a couple of times."

44:00.405 --> 44:02.939
About 99 times would be fine.

44:16.921 --> 44:19.389
I love staring
at empty refrigerators.

44:22.293 --> 44:26.029
When I was a kid, I'd imagine
they were full of ice cream.

44:27.098 --> 44:30.366
I could almost smell them,
chocolate,

44:30.368 --> 44:33.302
strawberry, vanilla.

44:36.207 --> 44:38.908
And then I would lick them
one by one.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.021
And then I would wipe
the cream off my face.

44:57.195 --> 44:59.362
Why did you leave
me on the side of the road, daddy?

45:00.932 --> 45:07.870
It was so cold
and my little body shivering.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.174
Helen?

45:12.711 --> 45:14.077
And you, mommy?

45:15.280 --> 45:17.146
I saw you watching, mommy.

45:18.717 --> 45:22.785
You just stared at the long road,
disappearing in the foggy night.

45:26.391 --> 45:28.257
They got time, daddy.

45:28.259 --> 45:31.260
Stop! What the fuck?

45:32.464 --> 45:36.532
Cheesy dialogue from a cheesy
TV show I used to watch.

45:38.903 --> 45:40.937
There was a lot of dead animals.

45:41.906 --> 45:45.842
The bird. The pink bird.
The cow.

45:47.112 --> 45:48.978
The goat.

45:53.218 --> 45:55.785
- What?
- What the fuck?

45:57.756 --> 45:59.989
Okay, we gotta go.
We gotta follow her.

45:59.991 --> 46:01.824
Yeah, yeah.

46:01.826 --> 46:04.861
- Wait. You forgot something.
- What did...

46:04.863 --> 46:06.162
Your camera, bro.

46:06.164 --> 46:07.897
- Do you mean it?
- Yeah.

46:09.267 --> 46:12.535
- I love you so much right now.
- Don't push it.

46:18.076 --> 46:19.842
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

46:25.517 --> 46:27.817
- Wait, it's not going to work.
- What? Why?

46:27.819 --> 46:31.254
It's a Muslim demon. It's not
gonna give a shit about Christ.

46:31.256 --> 46:34.090
- How do you it's a Muslim?
- It was speaking Arabic.

46:34.993 --> 46:37.360
You're being so racist
right now. Let's go.

46:41.599 --> 46:43.833
- You ready?
- Oh god!

46:46.271 --> 46:49.505
The power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you.

46:49.507 --> 46:54.110
The power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you.

46:54.112 --> 46:57.547
The power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you.

46:57.549 --> 47:00.283
- What are you laughing at?
- Guys, what are you doing?

47:00.285 --> 47:03.219
We're exorcising you, Helen.
It's for your own good.

47:03.221 --> 47:05.054
- With that?
- What's wrong with it?

47:08.293 --> 47:12.295
- Want to dance, Marky boy?
- What?

47:12.297 --> 47:13.996
My little fuck boy.

47:13.998 --> 47:17.633
Run, Mark.
Run, run, run, run, run.

47:17.635 --> 47:19.302
No. Not like this.

47:29.948 --> 47:32.248
<i>You want to play hide and seek?</i>

47:52.003 --> 47:53.536
Fuck! Shit!

48:12.657 --> 48:18.961
<i>Ring-a-round the rosies.</i>
<i>A pocket full of posies. Ashes!</i>

48:21.165 --> 48:23.232
Fuck! Shit.

49:05.410 --> 49:07.410
<i>What did you say her name was?</i>

49:07.412 --> 49:09.512
<i> Mancherbruuk.</i>
<i>You can't miss her.</i>

49:09.514 --> 49:11.247
<i>Her hell is contagious.</i>

49:15.253 --> 49:18.187
Hello. Oh!

49:18.189 --> 49:19.488
Scary, yeah!

49:21.059 --> 49:23.526
Oh nice!

49:23.528 --> 49:25.161
Amazing.

49:27.332 --> 49:29.465
Blood seems to be real.

49:30.368 --> 49:34.370
Mmm... Yeah, a little over real.
I know.

49:34.372 --> 49:38.574
You know what I think? I think that Mrs.
Frangier's dark little secret

49:38.576 --> 49:40.209
is about to be revealed.

49:40.211 --> 49:42.378
I have been watching movies.

49:42.380 --> 49:44.313
Lot of movies.

49:44.315 --> 49:47.450
In "Rosemary's Baby"
there is a secret passage

49:47.452 --> 49:50.753
connecting Rosemary's apartment
to Mrs. Castevet's.

49:50.755 --> 49:53.456
Therefore,
it would not surprise me

49:53.458 --> 49:59.095
if there was a similar passage
to Daniel's room.

49:59.097 --> 50:00.796
If you don't mind young lady,

50:00.798 --> 50:02.698
I am going to take a look
upstairs

50:02.700 --> 50:05.067
and try to find
the secret passage.

50:12.543 --> 50:15.311
What's going on in here?

50:19.250 --> 50:21.484
Oh!

52:00.518 --> 52:04.386
Mark!

52:09.727 --> 52:11.927
- Einar, where are you?
- Mark?

52:11.929 --> 52:14.330
Come on. Oh my god.
There you are. Hey.

52:14.332 --> 52:16.465
- Hey. Untie me. Untie me.
- What happened to you?

52:16.467 --> 52:18.200
Nothing. Don't worry about it.
Untie me.

52:18.202 --> 52:20.870
- What's that shit on you?
- Nothing. Untie me.

52:20.872 --> 52:23.405
Jeez, you jerk off
with your hands tied?

52:23.407 --> 52:24.940
Yeah, I jerked off
with my hands tied.

52:24.942 --> 52:27.276
It's really fucking easy.
Come on. Untie me.

52:27.278 --> 52:29.445
- Where is she?
- I don't know where she is.

52:29.447 --> 52:31.514
I don't know.
Where the fuck have you been?

52:31.516 --> 52:34.884
- Oh!
- Helen!

52:34.886 --> 52:37.186
She's gone, man.

52:37.188 --> 52:39.455
You want to help
with my feet at least? Oh!

52:40.892 --> 52:43.425
- Helen!
- Einar.

52:43.427 --> 52:47.663
Dude. Wait up. Shit!

52:47.665 --> 52:50.766
Dame it, dude.

52:51.569 --> 52:54.970
- I can't find her anywhere.
- Dude, I'm so sorry.

52:54.972 --> 52:58.174
We could-- we could um,
we could call the police,

52:58.176 --> 53:01.911
- tell them everything we know.
- That's a genius. Just genius.

53:01.913 --> 53:04.413
You want to end up in a Moroccan
prison for the rest of your life?

53:04.415 --> 53:07.716
Shit, you're right. You're right.
You're right. Fuck, we're fucked.

53:07.718 --> 53:10.986
That's exactly what we are,
fucked. It's all your fault!

53:12.190 --> 53:13.822
- My fault?
- You got it.

53:13.824 --> 53:14.924
My fault?

53:14.926 --> 53:18.227
You're the one who knew
Helen was prone to possession.

53:18.229 --> 53:20.396
You're the one who knew
that she was possessed as a kid.

53:20.398 --> 53:23.933
You knew Casablanca
was gonna be a bad place for her

53:23.935 --> 53:26.268
but you know, you came.
It's your fucking fault.

53:26.270 --> 53:28.938
- You kept the fucking secret.
- You're the one who let her go.

53:28.940 --> 53:31.507
I told you, she knocked me out.
I was passed out.

53:31.509 --> 53:35.277
I'm sure you love that shit.
You just love being knocked out.

53:35.279 --> 53:36.912
How do I love being knocked out?

53:36.914 --> 53:39.582
Figure it out.
Figure it out, Mr. Storyteller.

53:39.584 --> 53:41.784
You're so caught up
in your imaginary tales,

53:41.786 --> 53:44.620
you don't respect reality.
You don't know what reality is.

53:44.622 --> 53:46.422
- My story is not--
- Like you're in a fucking movie.

53:46.424 --> 53:48.457
My stories are not imaginary.
They're real.

53:48.459 --> 53:49.825
- Oh they're real?
- Yeah.

53:49.827 --> 53:51.427
Where can I see
one of your real,

53:51.429 --> 53:52.595
real tales? Huh?

53:52.597 --> 53:54.296
On Netflix? Hulu?

53:54.298 --> 53:55.965
No, not even on YouTube.

53:57.902 --> 53:58.968
You're a failure, man.

53:58.970 --> 54:02.705
You know what your problem is?
You have one foot in the past,

54:02.707 --> 54:05.608
one foot in the future
and you piss on the present.

54:06.510 --> 54:08.711
Whatever you went through,
when you were a kid,

54:08.713 --> 54:10.846
you should have
just dealt with it.

54:10.848 --> 54:13.983
Because now you're spilling
that shit on me and Helen.

54:14.952 --> 54:16.785
That's what cowards do.

54:16.787 --> 54:20.322
That's exactly what you are.
You're a big fat coward.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.393
Oh, that felt good.

54:24.395 --> 54:26.962
God, I am so glad you feel good,

54:27.965 --> 54:32.067
'cause that feels good now.

54:32.069 --> 54:33.535
That felt good.

54:33.537 --> 54:34.770
I'm surprised.

54:44.882 --> 54:46.749
What the fuck--?

54:46.751 --> 54:48.751
- Shit!
- Who the fuck is that?

54:48.753 --> 54:51.420
That's-- that's Mancherbruuk.

54:51.422 --> 54:53.856
- Is she dead? -I don't know.
I didn't touch her.

54:59.363 --> 55:01.997
The motor.

55:03.601 --> 55:04.633
It stopped.

55:07.071 --> 55:08.337
And there's electricity.

55:19.817 --> 55:22.418
- Shit, it's open.
- Yeah, I can see that.

55:23.354 --> 55:25.587
What do we do? What do we do?

55:31.962 --> 55:33.962
Mark? Mark?

55:38.736 --> 55:42.838
Einar...
What the fuck was that? Oh shit!

55:42.840 --> 55:44.106
What the fuck is this?

55:45.409 --> 55:47.042
- What the fuck is that?
- I don't know.

55:47.044 --> 55:50.579
Oh shit!
Mark, is that a fucking lamb?

55:50.581 --> 55:52.648
- Is that a real human being?
- Oh shit.

55:52.650 --> 55:55.951
- Yeah, yeah. Okay. We got to go.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

55:55.953 --> 55:57.820
- What do you mean no?
- No, we've gone too far.

55:57.822 --> 55:59.488
Fucking shut up!

56:01.092 --> 56:02.891
Okay. Okay.

56:02.893 --> 56:07.596
Oh. What is--
what is this? Oh my God.

56:09.767 --> 56:12.134
What are you doing?
Why are you touching it?

56:12.136 --> 56:14.937
- Why are you touching it?
- What the fuck is that?

56:14.939 --> 56:17.139
Oh, God, no!

56:17.141 --> 56:18.807
Oh, shit!

56:18.809 --> 56:21.777
There's got to be
something, a way out.

56:21.779 --> 56:22.778
Where are you going?

56:25.649 --> 56:27.850
Wait. The motor is meant
to cover their screams.

56:27.852 --> 56:30.152
Shit, you think so?

56:32.757 --> 56:34.957
- I see lights.
- Where are they coming from?

56:34.959 --> 56:37.159
I don't know. I've never
been here before. Shut up!

56:39.630 --> 56:41.830
Okay. What's that smell?

56:41.832 --> 56:44.867
That's smell?
I don't know. It smells bad.

56:44.869 --> 56:47.836
- A bit like Sulfur.
- I don't know.

56:47.838 --> 56:49.605
- Okay, okay.
- What are you doing?

56:49.607 --> 56:51.940
- I don't know--
- Don't go in there.

56:51.942 --> 56:54.777
- Sh...
- You stupid prick.

56:54.779 --> 56:58.213
- I hate you. I fucking hate you.
- What the fuck is...

57:00.885 --> 57:02.851
Oh! It's a bunch
of kid shit.

57:02.853 --> 57:05.454
It's a bunch of kid shit.

57:05.456 --> 57:07.689
- And um, it's posters.
- This is Daniel's room.

57:08.559 --> 57:11.760
- This is Daniel's room.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe.

57:14.532 --> 57:17.032
Tareek. Mrs. Frangier.

57:17.034 --> 57:18.767
What's going on?

57:18.769 --> 57:20.536
Oh fuck, it's locked.

57:20.538 --> 57:23.672
Not even try.

57:24.575 --> 57:25.974
Tareek, put the gun down.

57:31.215 --> 57:35.684
- Yes, he was 11 years when it happened.
- What? Who?

57:35.686 --> 57:37.886
- We tried everything.
- Daniel?

57:37.888 --> 57:41.123
Every possible exorcism
you can imagine.

57:41.125 --> 57:44.760
Until I came to understand
that the demon inside of my son

57:44.762 --> 57:47.796
- is what keeps him alive.
- Oh shit!

57:50.768 --> 57:54.903
- Is that Daniel?
- If the demon dies, my son dies.

57:54.905 --> 57:55.838
Tareek?

57:59.243 --> 58:00.609
Daniel?

58:00.611 --> 58:01.777
Son of a bitch!

58:01.779 --> 58:02.911
- What?
- Stay back.

58:02.913 --> 58:04.746
Please. Go! Get back!

58:04.748 --> 58:07.282
The only way to keep
my son alive

58:07.284 --> 58:12.254
is to feed the demon a soul,
every six years.

58:13.123 --> 58:16.158
Not any soul.

58:16.160 --> 58:20.629
A soul tortured enough,
a soul dark enough,

58:20.631 --> 58:26.268
so he can feed off of it
and live for another six years.

58:26.270 --> 58:30.172
A soul like
the one of your friend, Helen.

58:30.174 --> 58:31.673
What? You fucking--

58:33.744 --> 58:37.946
Twenty years with a demon,
you learn a few tricks.

58:37.948 --> 58:42.017
Tareek, take care
of our guest as usual.

58:42.019 --> 58:43.685
Yes, master.

58:44.722 --> 58:46.889
Tareek,
you don't have to do this.

58:46.891 --> 58:48.957
Tareek, please.
You don't have to do this.

58:48.959 --> 58:52.094
Please, Mark.
Don't resist. Just walk.

58:52.096 --> 58:54.830
Tareek, you don't have to do
this. Please don't do this.

58:54.832 --> 58:57.099
You can't just leave him here.
We gotta get him a doctor.

58:57.101 --> 58:58.934
You can't just leave him
here, please.

58:58.936 --> 59:01.637
Okay. Einar,
I'm coming back for you.

59:01.639 --> 59:02.938
I'm coming back for you, buddy.

59:04.575 --> 59:06.575
I'm coming back, buddy.

59:23.727 --> 59:27.863
Tareek, please tell me.
How do I look?

59:27.865 --> 59:29.631
You look perfect, master.

59:29.633 --> 59:33.001
Not the Hollywood reaction,
please.

59:33.003 --> 59:34.770
I want the truth.

59:36.307 --> 59:38.974
I think there's a little
too much lipstick.

59:39.944 --> 59:44.880
Extravagance is a privilege only
very few can carry with elegance.

59:45.849 --> 59:47.583
Tell me I'm elegant.

59:48.852 --> 59:50.852
You are very elegant, master.

59:50.854 --> 59:53.188
The very is not necessary,

59:53.190 --> 59:56.658
but do you have always
to embellish things?

59:57.828 --> 59:59.094
I am sorry, master.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.862
And don't say, "I'm sorry."

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:05.867
It drains the little bit
of dignity you have left.

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.603
Sorry.

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:09.871
Help!

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:11.006
What is this?

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.176
It's the boys, Master.

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:15.877
Didn't you bury them yet?

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:18.747
Not yet, Master.

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:20.916
Why?

01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:26.054
I know you want me to continue
filming, Master,

01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:29.124
but it's been their story
from the beginning.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.093
Their point of view

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:33.929
and if suddenly
the point of view shifts,

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:36.999
it will be in steep rupture
with basic film drama.

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:39.401
So I'm just suggesting

01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:41.436
not to kill them
till they finish their film.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.942
Since when, are you passionate
about cinema?

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:50.212
I've always been very passionate
about cinema, Master.

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:52.214
I just never mentioned it.

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:56.251
You are not to be passionate
about anything.

01:00:57.354 --> 01:01:01.023
The only thing you are to be
passionate about is me.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:05.293
Do you understand that?

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:07.663
Yes, Master.

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:11.366
And you will bury them tonight.

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:13.301
Yes, Master.

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:21.243
Help!

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:24.312
Help!

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:26.481
Help!

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:28.417
Somebody, please help!

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:32.354
Help! Help!

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:35.791
Mark, how many times
do I have to tell you

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:37.993
you're shouting through
a cemented window?

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:43.298
They were waiting for us,
in Daniel's room.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:47.002
They even shut off the motor
to lure us in.

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:49.705
We fell right
into their trap. Get it?

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:53.942
- Don't talk like that--
- They've thought of everything.

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:55.143
It's over.

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:57.279
It's over.

01:01:58.882 --> 01:01:59.815
It's okay.

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:03.051
We had a good run.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:09.825
I guess, I'll never
get to make my movie.

01:02:09.827 --> 01:02:16.531
You really think your little stupid found-footage
horror film would have changed something?

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:18.366
Huh? Changed the world?

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:22.771
Do you know how you Marks
there are out there, right now,

01:02:22.773 --> 01:02:25.874
trying to do exactly the same
thing you were trying to do?

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:30.312
How's your film any more special
than theirs?

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:32.781
Everyone dies
in a found-footage movie.

01:02:32.783 --> 01:02:34.182
I would have lived.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.551
Oh! Wouldn't that be a twist?

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:39.955
And how would that work exactly?
Can you share?

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:42.057
Because maybe we can
get the fuck out of here.

01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:47.996
You know, these are
our last moments together,

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:50.298
a little character
transformation wouldn't hurt.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.256
Fuck you!

01:02:58.257 --> 01:02:59.406
How's that for character
transformation?

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:01.376
Perfect.

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:09.451
I'm sorry, guys.

01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:11.953
It's time to go.

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:21.163
Hurry up please,
they don't have much time.

01:03:22.032 --> 01:03:23.165
What's the rush?

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:24.599
The transfer of the soul

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:26.434
needs to be done
before midnight.

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:27.869
Helen's gone.

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:29.538
You're not gonna
get her.

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:33.008
She will be found trust me.

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:37.913
By who? The government?

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.288
Booyah is real, isn't it?

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:53.128
Tareek... is Booyah real?

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:57.899
Booyah is just
an old legend, Einar.

01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:01.870
That tale grandmothers
tell their children

01:04:01.872 --> 01:04:04.339
so that they don't go out
playing in the street at night.

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:06.141
You're lying.

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:08.977
You're lying.

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:14.216
I need to take a piss.

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:17.352
Can I take a piss before I die?

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.486
Can you please give me that?

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:20.956
Sure.

01:04:28.432 --> 01:04:30.265
You're not holding it right.

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:32.634
The camera-- your--

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:36.004
it's just there's better--
there's better ways to hold it.

01:04:36.006 --> 01:04:39.608
So, you can hold like this
and you can pan it around.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:45.380
It's as simple as that. And we
can get the screen like this.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:49.317
That way you can view it without
actually having to lose your shot.

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:51.353
You can also hold it like this.

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:53.588
Are you in low light mode?

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:58.960
- Low light mode?
- Um you get better dynamic range in low light mode.

01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:01.162
A better latitude.

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:05.967
- Latitude?
- Latitude, yeah.

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:12.140
- Put it down.
- Do it.

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:14.142
Einar, just do it.

01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:15.911
He can't shoot both of us,
trust me.

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:17.612
- Shut up, Mark.
- Please...

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:19.214
calm down, Einar.

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:21.650
Please just take him out.

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:23.585
Just take him out.

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:24.986
Come on! Do it.

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:25.921
Do you want me to...

01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:32.227
What the fuck?

01:05:33.931 --> 01:05:35.730
It's okay.

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:37.198
I'm sorry.

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:39.301
Fuck!

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:50.679
You've been very silent, Tareek.

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:53.014
Are you sad?

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:56.551
Yes, Master. A little bit.

01:05:57.387 --> 01:05:58.320
You shouldn't be.

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:02.123
You saved one life.

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:07.696
You give him a rubber hose
so he could breathe

01:06:07.698 --> 01:06:09.130
and a torchlight,

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:13.468
so he could light
during the night.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.103
But tell me,

01:06:16.707 --> 01:06:17.772
which one was it?

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:23.111
The cute one or the other one?

01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:26.614
The other one or the cute one?

01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:29.384
Come on.

01:06:30.721 --> 01:06:31.653
Tell me.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:57.412
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

01:06:57.414 --> 01:07:03.485
Uh! Mark. Uh, Mark!

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:12.360
You're shaking

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.696
as if I was going
to reprimand you.

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:18.099
Sorry, Master. I'm very sorry.

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:21.269
I respect your feelings, Tareek.

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:26.708
Look, it's a full moon tonight.

01:07:29.046 --> 01:07:30.745
I like full moons.

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:35.050
They're filled
with so much meaning,

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:37.552
all these legends
about full moons,

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:41.389
all these creepy tales
of darkness.

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:45.493
There is this legend
about an old woman

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:47.529
who kills people with an ax.

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:49.664
Have you ever heard of it?

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:54.402
It is called

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:01.843
The legend of the woman
with big grey eyes.

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:05.747
So this woman,
she's driving in her car alone,

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:09.617
her eyes fixed on the road.

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:13.121
The moon is staring at her
but she never looks at the moon.

01:08:13.723 --> 01:08:16.457
So the moon becomes dense

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.393
and begins to darken.

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:22.430
Her blue tones slowly fade

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:26.501
and a greyish veil
begins to envelope her.

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:28.703
The old woman feels so sick

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:35.109
like a strange tingling
sensation on her neck.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:37.812
She looks up, and there...

01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:39.581
suddenly...

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:49.724
The moon's eyes close

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:53.394
and her blue dress
slowly envelopes her.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:57.499
And she disappears
into the darkness.

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:23.191
Fuck!

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:25.827
Mark?

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:31.533
Mark!

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:38.339
Mark!

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:42.710
Are you down there!

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:49.450
Fuck! Fuck!

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:55.190
Mark! Come on,
talk to me, buddy.

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:30.792
Mark. Mark.

01:10:34.764 --> 01:10:36.231
Fuck.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:41.936
Come on.

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:53.448
Mark?

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:56.951
Mark?

01:11:01.558 --> 01:11:02.557
Come on, buddy.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:15.570
No! No!

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:14.329
How are you, sweetie?

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:15.830
Stay quiet.

01:12:17.467 --> 01:12:20.601
If you stay quiet,
everything will be just fine.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.604
Do you understand?

01:12:49.099 --> 01:12:51.065
Oh, fuck.

01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:52.767
You got to stay calm.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:14.989
Helen!

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.526
Helen!

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:35.877
Excuse me. Booyah?
Do you know where Booyah is?

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:37.578
Booyah!

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.680
- Do you know where Booyah is?
- What?

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:53.428
Excuse me, Booyah?
Do you know where Booyah is?

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:55.897
Booyah?
Do you know where Booyah is?

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:41.943
Help. Help me.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:50.585
Help! Help! Help. I need help.

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:52.119
Do you know where Booyah is?
Can you take me?

01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:54.522
Can you take me to Bo-- Fuck!

01:14:55.492 --> 01:14:56.791
Fuck!

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:04.599
Please, stop. Stop!

01:15:11.274 --> 01:15:12.874
Can you take me to Booyah?

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:14.675
Sir?

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:15.743
You can?

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:18.679
Sir, please.

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.014
Yes? You can?

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:24.986
Are you an angel?

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:36.190
Lord of darkness.

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:38.759
You are the king of universe.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:41.362
It is filled with your darkness

01:16:41.364 --> 01:16:44.031
and your darkness alone.

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:47.335
Command this soul into my son

01:16:47.337 --> 01:16:52.707
for you have done
him into your kingdom.

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:08.923
This is Booyah?

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.792
The old slaughterhouse?

01:18:07.383 --> 01:18:09.250
Oh, God!

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:22.129
Oh, God.

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:28.402
I just want my friend, Helen.

01:18:33.276 --> 01:18:36.277
Helen, I know you're in here.

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:40.748
I'm so sorry.

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:45.720
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
for everything that happened.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.157
Please, Helen.

01:18:52.495 --> 01:18:54.762
You just have to come out.

01:18:59.302 --> 01:19:00.367
Oh.

01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:05.039
Oh.

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:13.247
Just come out, Helen,
and we can go home.

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:24.391
Helen,
you just have to come out, okay.

01:19:30.767 --> 01:19:32.299
Let's go home.

01:20:58.387 --> 01:21:00.487
Helen!

01:21:02.391 --> 01:21:03.524
Helen!

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.626
Helen!

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:09.563
Helen!

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:11.065
Helen!

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:13.300
Helen!

01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:17.404
Helen!

01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:20.140
Helen, wait!

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:07.655
I'm so sorry.

01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:13.327
I'm so sorry.

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:29.209
We gotta go. We gotta go.

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:18.392
Who are you?

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:04.204
Sit down. Sit.

01:24:20.489 --> 01:24:21.488
Fuck.

01:24:23.426 --> 01:24:24.458
Fuck!

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:43.110
Helen... listen.

01:24:43.846 --> 01:24:45.512
I need to go back.

01:24:46.749 --> 01:24:48.382
I need to go get Mark's camera.

01:24:52.088 --> 01:24:54.088
You stay here. Okay?

01:24:55.324 --> 01:24:57.758
If I'm not back
in fifteen minutes,

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:00.394
go find the American Embassy.

01:25:00.396 --> 01:25:02.529
Tell them everything
that happened here.

01:25:04.467 --> 01:25:06.366
They won't believe you,

01:25:06.368 --> 01:25:09.503
but at least
you'll be safe. Okay?

01:25:13.909 --> 01:25:15.742
Hey, hey!

01:25:17.546 --> 01:25:18.479
Look at me.

01:25:21.117 --> 01:25:22.883
You'll get so many views.

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:26.687
Millions, millions of viewers.

01:25:28.324 --> 01:25:30.657
More reviews
that you could ever dream of.

01:25:32.261 --> 01:25:33.260
Okay?

01:25:38.767 --> 01:25:39.700
I love you.

01:26:57.646 --> 01:27:00.581
Okay. Okay.

01:27:08.857 --> 01:27:10.591
- Momma.
- What?

01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:16.496
Momma. Momma.

01:27:16.498 --> 01:27:18.632
Momma.

01:27:18.634 --> 01:27:21.468
Your mom is dead, Daniel.

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:32.246
Momma!

01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:36.016
Momma!

01:29:06.475 --> 01:29:07.708
This one's for you, Mark!
