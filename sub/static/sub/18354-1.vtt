00:21.589 --> 00:21.854
Which song?

00:21.889 --> 00:23.455
Hmm?

00:23.524 --> 00:24.804

Are you in there?

00:26.093 --> 00:28.460

I'm distracted by the piano.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.428
It is beautiful.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.030
And it cost
more than my car.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.531
Yeah,
it's pricey, but I mean,

00:32.566 --> 00:34.533
couldn't you just picture
our students playing it?

00:34.568 --> 00:37.269
We could put it on the
front cover of the brochure.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.371
Hmm, The Brooklyn
Music Institute,

00:39.407 --> 00:42.241
now with really
expensive piano's.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.276
See, that would make
me wanna go there.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.445
Sweetie, that's why
you teach piano

00:46.514 --> 00:48.047
and I handle
the business stuff.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.548
You dream
of making beautiful music

00:49.583 --> 00:52.051
and I dream
of paying the rent.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.019
Maybe Santa
will bring us one.

00:54.055 --> 00:55.120
That's the spirit.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.722
Hey, why don't
you play something?

00:56.757 --> 00:57.456
Oh, no.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.957
Come on.

00:59.026 --> 01:01.038
No, you know I don't like
playing in front of an audience.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.528
Hmm.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.898

there's nobody here.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.839

01:48.909 --> 01:49.608
Yep.

Yes, yes.

How do
you do that?

02:20.040 --> 02:21.440
Do what?

02:21.509 --> 02:24.443
Always know what Dad wants
before he knows he wants it.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.845
Being psychic was part
of the job description.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.282
Of course.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.851
And I will speak

02:32.887 --> 02:33.887
Goodbye.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.488
I heard all of that.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.426
Dad, can we go?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.395
The Christmas tree lot
is gonna be closing soon.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.331
Abigail, we've got
plenty of time.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.599
What if we're late?

02:47.668 --> 02:50.102
Well, we'll get a
Christmas tree tomorrow.

02:50.171 --> 02:52.571
That's what you
said yesterday.

02:54.175 --> 02:55.374
I did?

02:58.512 --> 03:00.946
So much for the father
of the year award, huh?

03:02.616 --> 03:04.416
It is at risk, yes.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.867
Where did
they come from?

03:21.902 --> 03:24.036
Sorry, next time I'll
barricade the door.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.071
I appreciate
that, let's go.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.374
Bye.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.510
You know, you were
really incredible in there,

03:31.545 --> 03:33.078
you should consider
performing again.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.514
Thank you, but I am perfectly
content being a music teacher.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.816
I don't miss being
on stage at all.

03:37.851 --> 03:41.887
Lizzie, I know what
happened was embarrassing,

03:41.922 --> 03:43.422
but it was
10 years ago.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.357
Sam, it was more
than embarrassing,

03:45.392 --> 03:48.193
it wasn't like I missed a
note during a talent show,

03:48.229 --> 03:50.929
I froze during my debut concert
in front of 1,000 people.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.698
You perform in front
of your students

03:52.733 --> 03:54.233
in the classroom
all the time.

03:54.268 --> 03:57.236
There's a difference
between a classroom and a stage.

03:57.271 --> 03:57.936
Listen...

03:59.340 --> 04:02.908
It happened, I moved on,
I'm fine right where I am.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.443
I get it.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.445
I could teach someone
to balance a cheque-book

04:06.480 --> 04:09.514
but I wouldn't wanna do it in
front of thousands of people.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.217
Thank you.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.257
Come on, let's go find a tree
for this Christmas concert.

04:18.325 --> 04:21.059
I just hope we can find one
that's not too embarrassed

04:21.095 --> 04:22.060
to be on stage.

04:22.096 --> 04:22.828
That's not funny.

04:22.863 --> 04:23.829
I think it's funny.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.063
It's not
funny at all!

04:25.099 --> 04:25.764
Funny!

04:25.833 --> 04:26.999
Not funny!

04:29.536 --> 04:31.536
You know what,
let's get outta' here.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.338
Tokyo will be
there in the morning.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.440
Oh good, Brad,
you're still here.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.644
Oh hey, Cynthia, I was actually
just on my way out the door.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.146
Abigail, you remember Cynthia,
she used to work with me

04:41.181 --> 04:43.882
but now she's VP at Business
Strategies for Mr. McKinley.

04:43.917 --> 04:44.917
What does
that mean?

04:44.985 --> 04:46.485
It means
I work too much

04:46.520 --> 04:49.421
and sometimes I have to beg
other people to work too much.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.423
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.191
You're so funny.

04:53.227 --> 04:55.427
I don't think so.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.429
Well, Travis
saw an article

04:57.498 --> 04:59.458
about this up and
coming neighbourhood in Brooklyn

04:59.500 --> 05:02.501
that all the tech companies
are going to and he wants in.

05:02.536 --> 05:05.737
Find an older building, update
it into high-end office space.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.539
Okay, well I'll pull the
available properties

05:07.574 --> 05:09.007

09:00.541 --> 09:01.973
What?
Where did you hear that?

09:02.009 --> 09:03.475
The dentist on
the fourth floor,

09:03.510 --> 09:05.477
he heard it from
the accountant on three,

09:05.512 --> 09:07.479
who apparently has a cousin,
who knows someone

09:07.514 --> 09:09.225
<i>who works in the
property manager's office.</i>

09:09.249 --> 09:12.217
Well, as long as you got it
straight from the horse's mouth.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.218
<i>Lizzie,
this is serious!</i>

09:13.253 --> 09:14.719

the rent goes up?

09:14.755 --> 09:16.454

a great deal here.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.456
Samantha, breathe, you
don't even know for sure

09:18.492 --> 09:19.958
if the building's
for sale yet.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.326
The dentist
seemed very sure.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.695
Well, the dentist works
with a lot of laughing gas,

09:23.730 --> 09:26.464
I'm not sure how much
stock we should put in him.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.700
Did you not hear me
say, this is serious?

09:28.735 --> 09:31.703
Sam, until we know for sure,
why don't we just worry about

09:31.738 --> 09:34.205
the things that we know
we need to worry about?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.807
Like the
Christmas concert,

09:35.842 --> 09:38.282
I mean, we still have rehearsals
to do, and programs to print.

09:38.312 --> 09:39.811

chosen a theme yet?

09:39.846 --> 09:40.745

09:46.687 --> 09:49.220

09:49.289 --> 09:52.524
See, you forgot about
the building already.

09:52.659 --> 09:55.560
Sure, not worried
about it at all.

It's not far
from the subway.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.306

10:14.081 --> 10:16.681
I'm gonna ask you a
question that will stump you.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.650
Yeah, good luck
with that.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.892
Hello.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.562
We're here to see
the building manager.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.446
I always get
tripped up by that spot.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.949
Earl, that was fantastic, I
can tell you've been practicing.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.450
It's not a
very hard song.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.486
Don't be modest,
you sound great.

10:54.521 --> 10:57.656
Oh,
I don't know.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.790
Have you
thought anymore

10:58.825 --> 11:00.203
about playing in the
Christmas concert.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.993
You think I'm
ready for an audience?

11:02.029 --> 11:02.994
Are you
kidding me?

11:03.030 --> 11:04.863
Yes! Of course!

11:06.333 --> 11:09.534
I ran a company for 50 years,
loved every minute of it

11:09.569 --> 11:12.570
but not as
much as I love this!

11:12.706 --> 11:14.305
I know
exactly what you mean.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.042
I should've turned the company
over to my son years ago.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.877
I didn't know
you had a son.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.614
We're not close.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.952
He took piano
lessons when he was a boy.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.189
He played
this song one year.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.192
I'm sorry, you don't
wanna hear all of this.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.295
I'll tell you what, if you
agree to be in the concert,

11:37.330 --> 11:41.633
I will reserve the best seats
in the house for your son.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.568
It's never too
late for Christmas.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.471
I'll think about that.

11:48.208 --> 11:48.873
Okay.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.208
Now move over,

11:50.243 --> 11:52.444
let me show you how to get
through that tough spot.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.479
Oh.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.146
I'll follow along.

11:55.182 --> 11:55.714
Ready?

11:55.782 --> 11:56.881
Mhm.

12:16.703 --> 12:17.969
Good.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.679
Where are
we with Toronto?

12:27.714 --> 12:29.180
It's done.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.116
Contracts are ready
for your signature.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.655
And that is how you
negotiate a deal, nicely done.

12:37.691 --> 12:38.389
What else?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.891
Company
Christmas party?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.227
Just tell me where to be and
how much it's gonna cost me.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.728
Next.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.274
Brad has a proposal for the
Brooklyn project you wanted.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.331
Excellent.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.832
Uhh, the
building's in great shape.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.000
It's 70 percent lease

12:49.035 --> 12:50.869
but everyone's on a
month to month deal,

12:50.904 --> 12:52.604
so that's
not an issue.

12:52.639 --> 12:53.938
What's on
the ground floor?

12:53.974 --> 12:57.342
A music school, it's nice
but it's not essential.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.810
Any problems with
the neighbours?

12:58.845 --> 13:01.546
It might go over better if
you added some conveniences,

13:01.615 --> 13:03.348
a coffee shop
or a market.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.985
Gourmet market thing is
really hot right now.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.787
Good idea, Brad.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.555
Uhh, any downside?

13:10.624 --> 13:11.624
There isn't one.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.124
I mean,
the price is right,

13:13.160 --> 13:15.660
and there's plenty of space once
we move everybody out.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.462
All right,
let's push forward with it.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.532
The accountants told me how
big our tax bill is gonna be

13:20.567 --> 13:23.635
if we don't reinvest by
January one, so we need this.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.370
As long as there
aren't any surprises,

13:25.438 --> 13:27.438
I want something
to sign by next week.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.874
Thanks Travis.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.445
That went well.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.159
Do you want some
help with the offer letter,

13:36.183 --> 13:38.650
I just did one for the
building over on fifth.

13:38.685 --> 13:39.884
Oh, that
would be great!

13:39.953 --> 13:41.886
We've got a lot
of work to do,

13:41.955 --> 13:45.190
if we're gonna get this all
done by the end of the year.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.357
Well,
if you want,

13:46.393 --> 13:48.726
we can go over it tonight,
say over dinner?

13:48.795 --> 13:50.195
Yeah.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.064
Oh no, I can't tonight,
Abigail's got a thing at home.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.966
I can bring it
over later.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.167
Okay, sure.

13:56.203 --> 13:59.971
Great, I will see
you around 7:30.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.006
Sounds good.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.608
Thanks Cynthia.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.649
Hey, I think I convinced Earl
to be in the Christmas concert.

14:11.685 --> 14:12.483
That's great!

14:12.519 --> 14:13.952
And I got
another sponsor,

14:13.987 --> 14:15.498
which means our donations
can go towards scholarships.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.222
So, we both had a
productive day?

14:17.290 --> 14:18.723
Yes we did,
are you off?

14:18.792 --> 14:21.492
Yes, I have a first meeting
with a new private student

14:21.528 --> 14:22.794
and her
dad in Manhattan.

14:22.829 --> 14:23.962
Oh,
well, good luck.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.763
If it works out,
bring her around here,

14:25.799 --> 14:28.266
we can always use more Manhattan
parents come donation time.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.268
I'll see what I
can do, goodnight.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.836
<i>Goodnight.</i>

14:39.980 --> 14:41.145
What is that?

14:42.649 --> 14:43.848
Beethoven?

14:43.884 --> 14:46.718
Ha-ha.

14:46.786 --> 14:51.856
<i>♪</i>

14:51.892 --> 14:53.958
You don't have to
do this you know.

14:53.994 --> 14:54.959
I know.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.461
I mean, you have
to meet with her

14:56.496 --> 14:58.696
because she's gonna
be here in about a minute

14:58.765 --> 15:01.499
but if you don't wanna
take lessons from her

15:01.534 --> 15:04.135
or if you don't wanna
take lessons at all,

15:04.170 --> 15:07.639
or even if you do,
no pressure from me.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.307
Dad, chill.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.178
I know,
it's complicated but,

15:14.214 --> 15:16.180
I think your mother
would be really happy

15:16.216 --> 15:17.782
that you're
playing again.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.451
Thinking about
playing again.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.622
I'll get it.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.865
Hi.

15:36.303 --> 15:40.271
Uhh, come in,
come in.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.276
In here.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.945
Oh, I see you uhh,
found a tree.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.479
Yes we did.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.149
And we're gonna decorate
it tonight, right dad?

15:51.184 --> 15:54.452
Well, I do have some work
to do but, absolutely,

15:54.487 --> 15:56.554
we are decorating
the tree tonight.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.655
Here, have a seat.

15:57.691 --> 15:59.490
Thank you.

16:00.694 --> 16:05.697
Uhh so, Dave Nevatsky, I work
with him and you taught his son.

16:05.765 --> 16:06.464
Evan, yeah.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.532
He was great.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.300
He plays keyboard
in a rock band now

16:09.336 --> 16:12.036
so all those Mozart Sonata's
I taught him really paid off.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.639
How long have
you been teaching?

16:14.674 --> 16:16.040
Uhh, about 10 years.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.676
I started playing when
I was three or so my Dad said.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.479
Twinkle, Twinkle little star
was a big hit in my house.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.514
Where'd you study?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.282
I went to Juilliard.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.317
Oh, impressive.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.696
Yeah, I'm really
glad it went there.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.853
It actually taught me
a lot about teaching.

16:28.922 --> 16:31.022
And, how many
students do you have?

16:31.091 --> 16:34.192
Dad, we don't need to know
every last detail of her life.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.161
It's okay, you can ask as
many questions as you want.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.931
One of my piano teachers
had a plaque on the wall

16:39.966 --> 16:42.200
with a quote by Hans
Christian Anderson that said,

16:42.268 --> 16:45.436
"Where words fail,
music speaks."

16:45.472 --> 16:48.306
You need the right person
to help you find your voice.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.809
So, you can ask
anything you want.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.311

Hi.

17:10.663 --> 17:14.198
Hi, I brought the draft of
the offer letter and some wine.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.134
Little reward
for working late.

17:17.704 --> 17:21.339
Oh, hi.
Am I interrupting?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.807
Yes.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.443
No, it's just
a piano lesson.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.045
Oh wonderful.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.646
Hi,
I'm Cynthia Brooks.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.314
Lizzie Moore,
nice to meet you.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.350
I'll bet she is
a great student.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.352
Well, we should
let them get to it.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.854
Abigail if you need me,
I'll be in my office.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.457
It's just a piano lesson,
Dad, not math homework.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.492
In other words,
"Go away, Dad."

17:41.528 --> 17:43.795
You said it,
not me.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.204
Sorry about that, it's her first
lesson with a new teacher,

17:53.273 --> 17:54.605
so it's
very dramatic.

17:54.641 --> 17:55.840
I get it.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.176
Uhh, do you want some
wine while we do this.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.179
Uhh, no, I'm good.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.648
I can open it for you
though, if you like.

18:03.683 --> 18:07.251
Oh no, I'm good, probably
keep my wits about me.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.253
Right, okay.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.391
Ong have
you been playing?

18:13.426 --> 18:16.094
Started when I was six,
stopped when I was twelve.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.495
Why'd you stop?

18:18.998 --> 18:21.466
My mom was
really into music.

18:21.501 --> 18:25.269
When she died it just didn't
feel the same without her.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.973
That's how I felt
when I lost my Dad,

18:29.008 --> 18:31.075
he's the one who
taught me to play.

18:32.912 --> 18:36.314
Okay, let's see
what you got.

18:52.398 --> 18:53.331
That's great.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.571
You know it?

19:00.607 --> 19:01.506
Of course.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.169
You're a natural.

19:31.237 --> 19:35.907
That song's easy, it's the
first one I ever learned.

19:40.146 --> 19:48.146
So, if we move this paragraph to
here, I think that's it, right?

19:49.255 --> 19:50.655
Looks good to me.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.090
Great, that was easier than
I thought it was gonna be.

19:53.126 --> 19:56.327
It's a nice change of pace not
to have to work until midnight.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.430
Travis is a
Taskmaster.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.165
Yes.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.000
Although, I've gotten
so used to it,

20:03.069 --> 20:05.236
I don't even know what
to do with myself

20:05.271 --> 20:06.771
when I have
a night off.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.208
Nothing, you sit
on the couch, you watch TV,

20:10.243 --> 20:12.243
you eat food that
is bad for you.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.744
That is a night off.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.414
Maybe the next time we have
the same night off together,

20:16.449 --> 20:17.815
we could do that.

20:18.751 --> 20:22.587
Yeah,
sounds like fun.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.091
Great.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.349
You know, I also teach at a
music school in Brooklyn.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.306
We do a big Christmas
concert every year,

20:42.375 --> 20:43.574
you should be in it.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.242
Me?

20:44.277 --> 20:45.209
I'm not good enough.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.077
You're more
than good enough.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.311
I haven't
played in years.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.580
Oh well, then I see
we have something else

20:49.616 --> 20:51.048
we need to work on.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.084
What?

20:52.118 --> 20:53.484
Your confidence.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.197
And you can take your lessons
at the school anytime,

20:55.221 --> 20:56.954
we got lots
of kids your age

20:56.990 --> 20:58.756
studying all different
kinds of music.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.057
Yeah,
I'll think about it.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.126
Great.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.094
How we doing?

21:03.129 --> 21:04.895
Umm,
just wrapped up.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.597
Is she ready
for Carnegie Hall?

21:06.633 --> 21:07.765
Absolutely.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.268
Good, you can
support me in my old age.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.938
I will see you
tomorrow.

21:13.973 --> 21:14.872
Yes.

21:14.907 --> 21:15.907
Nice to meet you.

21:15.942 --> 21:16.641
You too.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.075
Night, Abigail.

21:20.647 --> 21:21.279
So?

21:21.314 --> 21:22.246
I'll be right back.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.215
Okay.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.890
So, it's good?

21:32.925 --> 21:34.925
I think so,
she's umm, fantastic.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.961
It's like she's got
music in her DNA.

21:37.030 --> 21:38.729
She definitely gets
that from her mother.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.965
I don't have a
musical bone in my body.

21:41.034 --> 21:43.467

staring at the piano,

44:52.691 --> 44:54.624

your audience.

forget my audience.

47:29.948 --> 47:33.683
From the school
or the teacher?

47:33.751 --> 47:34.751
Both.

47:35.820 --> 47:37.498
I mean, I've looked
at this from every angle

48:50.795 --> 48:53.296
Kids at

48:53.331 --> 48:55.831

48:55.900 --> 48:59.302
a wardrobe malfunction
or your piano caught fire.

seen it before.

57:38.255 --> 57:39.255
I'm fine.

57:45.496 --> 57:46.995
Nice work
on the contracts.

57:47.865 --> 57:49.264
I'm sorry?

57:49.333 --> 57:51.044
Legal sent up the contracts
for the Brooklyn building

57:51.068 --> 57:52.201
this afternoon.

57:52.236 --> 57:53.402
They what?

57:53.437 --> 57:55.015
I signed them, sent
them back, done deal.

57:55.039 --> 57:56.039
No.

57:57.875 --> 58:00.609
Is there a reason,
I shouldn't have signed them?

58:03.113 --> 58:06.582
No, it was
the best deal.

58:07.184 --> 58:09.084
Then to all,
a good night.

58:20.498 --> 58:22.264
Would you
like to get a drink?

58:22.333 --> 58:23.365
Sure.

58:23.567 --> 58:25.334
We still gonna
talk to your boss?

58:25.369 --> 58:29.071
As long as you're up for it, I
hear he's in a pretty good mood.

58:29.106 --> 58:30.572
Good enough
to save a school?

58:30.608 --> 58:31.840
We're about
to find out.

58:31.876 --> 58:32.876
Travis?

58:33.677 --> 58:34.677
Brad.

58:35.112 --> 58:35.777
Merry Christmas.

58:35.846 --> 58:36.712
Merry Christmas, Travis.

58:36.747 --> 58:38.180
And who's this
beautiful lady?

58:38.215 --> 58:40.716
This is Lizzie Moore of the
Brooklyn Music Institute.

58:40.751 --> 58:42.017
It's nice
to meet you.

58:42.052 --> 58:43.552
It's nice
to meet you too.

58:43.587 --> 58:46.255
Sir, I'd like to invite you
to our Christmas Eve concert.

58:46.323 --> 58:48.757
It's a great night of music
where we raise funds

58:48.826 --> 58:50.058
for our
scholarship program.

58:50.094 --> 58:52.761
I just think if you see the
kind of work we do

58:52.830 --> 58:54.790
you would understand how
important this school is.

58:54.832 --> 58:57.032
I appreciate the offer
and I'd love to attend.

58:57.067 --> 58:58.767
Umm, you know
when I was younger

58:58.836 --> 59:00.536
I used to tickle
the ivories myself.

59:00.571 --> 59:01.937
You did?

59:02.006 --> 59:05.707
That's great, maybe you'd
like to take it up again.

59:05.743 --> 59:07.543
I know
a good piano teacher.

59:07.578 --> 59:09.578
She is a great teacher,
Abigail loves her.

59:09.613 --> 59:11.580
Actually, I think
I'm a little too old.

59:11.649 --> 59:13.715
No, one of my
favourite students is 70.

59:13.751 --> 59:15.484
He'll be
performing in the show too.

59:15.519 --> 59:17.486
You all deserve it, we really
appreciate your...

59:17.521 --> 59:18.587
Hard work.

59:18.656 --> 59:20.889
Excuse me.

59:20.925 --> 59:22.891
I guess you can
never say never, right?

59:22.927 --> 59:25.761
Umm, anyway
I appreciate the invitation

59:25.829 --> 59:28.397
and I look forward
to the concert and umm,

59:28.432 --> 59:30.365
I'm just glad there's
no hard feelings.

59:31.769 --> 59:32.769
About what?

59:32.836 --> 59:35.337
About the school.

59:35.372 --> 59:37.105
I'm sure you'll
find a new home.

59:37.174 --> 59:39.675
W-w-ell Travis, we still
have to work out the specifics.

59:39.710 --> 59:41.009
No,
it's all done.

59:41.045 --> 59:42.856
I signed the contracts to
complete the purchase

59:42.880 --> 59:45.314
of the building
this afternoon.

59:45.349 --> 59:47.049
<i>Isn't that right,
Cynthia?</i>

59:50.554 --> 59:53.388
Anyway, I look
forward to the show.

59:53.424 --> 59:55.824
It was nice
meeting you, Ms. Moore.

59:59.597 --> 01:00:00.597
Excuse me.

01:00:01.532 --> 01:00:02.532

For what?

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:26.588
As predicted,
I failed.

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:30.492
Lizzie, this isn't
your fault.

01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:31.627
You can't
blame yourself.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:33.228
It feels
like it is.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:37.933
Don't be silly, I mean, you
can't blame yourself for this

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.301
anymore
than we can blame,

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:41.737
I don't know, the dentist up
on the fourth floor.

01:00:41.772 --> 01:00:44.039
Can we blame the
dentist on the fourth floor?

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:45.107
Sure, sweetie.

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:53.382
It's funny, you know, I always
felt like what happened to me

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:56.418
on that stage was a
loss, you know,

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:59.388
like a part of me always
felt like I lost something,

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:06.461
but these past couple of weeks,
fighting for all of this,

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:09.297
I just, I get it, you know,
this is what matters.

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:11.233
This would
be the real loss.

01:01:14.605 --> 01:01:16.805
What are we gonna
tell the students?

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:19.307
Nothing.

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:23.045
It would break their hearts
and it would ruin the show.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.881
If this is gonna be our last
Christmas concert ever

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.816
then it's gonna
be the best.

01:01:27.985 --> 01:01:31.286
A big loud
celebration of Christmas, okay!

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:32.321
Okay.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:33.890
Loud.

01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:35.490
Okay!

01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:39.761
Let's take it
from the top.

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:43.098
<i>You know,
it's not too late.</i>

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:45.867
The contracts are
signed Meg, it is too late.

01:01:45.903 --> 01:01:47.536
Contracts can
be torn up.

01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:49.571
Travis is never gonna
tear up the contracts,

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:52.274
it would cost him too
much money at this point.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.609
Have you
talked to Lizzie?

01:01:54.645 --> 01:01:56.411
She's not
returning my calls.

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:58.714
Just give her time,
she'll come around.

01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:00.916
I just, I don't
understand Cynthia,

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:02.384
why didn't
she stop Travis,

01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:04.553
she's supposed
to be on our side.

01:02:04.588 --> 01:02:06.455
She's hurt by
you and Lizzie.

01:02:09.727 --> 01:02:10.992
Why would
she be hurt?

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.995
Brad, come on, you know
she has feelings for you.

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:16.531
What!?

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:17.432
No she doesn't.

01:02:17.468 --> 01:02:19.401
Brad, seriously!?

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:23.071
I noticed it the first time
I saw her in your office.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:25.941
Cynthia does not
have feelings for me,

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:28.744
we're coworkers,
we're friends.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.083
Oh no.

01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:40.555
I-I-I honestly
never saw it before.

01:02:42.593 --> 01:02:44.659
Oh, I feel terrible.

01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:46.962
Maybe you
should tell her that.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:51.199
Yeah, uhh, I'm gonna
catch up with you later.

01:02:51.235 --> 01:02:53.535
I'm gonna
go talk to her.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.212
Can I come in?

01:03:06.083 --> 01:03:07.083

Look, I really didn't mean do it
to happen like that, it's just...

Cynthia, I'm sorry.

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:26.968

You know that I have

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.544

working with you.

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:36.912

things easy

01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:39.581
and challenging all
at the same time.

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:45.220
More than anything,
I consider you a friend

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.792
and I realize that I haven't
been a very good one.

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:52.794
Brad, you don't
have to say this.

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:53.863
I do.

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:56.798
I'm really sorry.

01:03:57.234 --> 01:04:00.068
Still, I should have told
legal to hold the contracts.

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:02.237
I should've told
Travis not to sign it.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:03.805
He would've
signed it anyway.

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:08.543
I begged him to
reconsider but he won't budge.

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:11.913
I wouldn't
expect anything less.

01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:15.584
Lizzie
seems really nice.

01:04:17.955 --> 01:04:19.955
Yeah, yeah she is.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:26.228
Can I give you some
advice, as a friend?

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:29.932
Of course.

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:35.637
Don't miss your shot with her,
you'll regret it later.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:41.576

01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:08.436
Hey,
what are you...

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:11.640
Piano lesson.

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:16.711
Yeah, yeah,
no, I just figured...

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:19.114
We need to make
sure she's all set

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:20.749
for the concert
tomorrow night.

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:26.855
Right, of course, so you
decided to do the concert.

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.591
Yeah, I think
it'll be good.

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:30.759
So do I.

01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:35.297
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:05:36.233 --> 01:05:38.266
We really
need to practice.

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:42.203
Okay, yeah.

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:45.440
I'll just...

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:50.745
Okay,
let's try it again,

01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:53.515
and this time hit the
chorus really hard.

01:06:02.893 --> 01:06:04.726
You did
good today, Earl.

01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:08.897
Oh, well,
thank you Jordan.

01:06:08.932 --> 01:06:10.565
You were
very good yourself.

01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.968
It's gonna
be a good show.

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:16.738
Too bad it's gonna
be the last one.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.275
I'm really gonna
miss this place.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.944
What are you
talking about?

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:28.350
I overheard Ms. Washington
and Ms. Moore talking.

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:30.185
What'd they say?

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:35.790
Something-something about
the building being sold.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:39.561
I guess, they're
shutting down the school.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:41.796
Are you sure you
heard correctly?

01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:43.298
Pretty sure.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:48.570
I guess Juilliard's
gonna have to wait.

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:55.210
Well, anyways,
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:56.845
Goodnight, Earl.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:06:58.913
Goodnight, Jordan.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:04.686
What's up with
you and Lizzie?

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:06.087
What do you mean?

01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:09.257
You know what I mean,
you're upset, she's upset.

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:11.726
You two could barely
look at each other earlier.

01:07:11.762 --> 01:07:12.861
Did she
say anything?

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:14.929
No but
I asked her.

01:07:14.965 --> 01:07:16.765
She said to
concentrate on the concert.

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:22.103
Well, she's right.

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:24.773
The concert is the most
important thing right now.

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:29.344
No Dad, you are
and Lizzie is too!

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:31.246
What's going on?

01:07:37.254 --> 01:07:38.720
Dad?

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:42.390
My company bought the building
where the music school is,

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:46.694
which means, the school's
probably gonna have to close.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:48.463
What, Dad!?

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:50.532
I've tried
everything to make it work.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:51.966
Well, try harder!

01:07:52.035 --> 01:07:53.946
Abigail, sometimes in life
things don't always work out

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:56.037
the way we
want them to, it's just...

01:07:57.441 --> 01:07:58.940
Business.

01:07:59.009 --> 01:08:04.045
Dad, that school's not just
business to her, it's personal.

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:08.450
Honey, I'm sorry.

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:10.752
No, Dad,
you're right.

01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:14.923
Sometimes things don't work out
and there's nothing you can do.

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:19.027
Sometimes things break
and you can't fix them.

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:23.430
