00:24.042 --> 00:25.441
Synchro: mpm

00:34.815 --> 00:36.337
Cello, everyone.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.496
Steve, whoever told you
that is funny

00:38.621 --> 00:40.581
is not looking out
for your best interest.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.363
Your friend can't stay for dinner.

00:42.488 --> 00:44.256
This isn't
a Stovetop Stuffing commercial.

00:44.381 --> 00:45.931
No, this is my cello.

00:46.066 --> 00:48.810
- I've been playing it for five years.
- Since you were two?

00:48.935 --> 00:50.035
Dad, I'm 14.

00:50.182 --> 00:51.384
I don't think so.

00:52.581 --> 00:54.549
I feel like Dad barely knows me.

00:54.674 --> 00:56.249
I just wish we could bond.

00:56.633 --> 00:59.348
You're growing
into such a sensitive young woman.

00:59.473 --> 01:02.533
Steve, here's the thing.
You have to take some initiative.

01:02.753 --> 01:04.822
You know, share something with him.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.290
I'd like to share something
with you.

01:11.911 --> 01:14.113
That was going nowhere.
Mail call!

01:14.295 --> 01:16.885
Per usual, I opened
and read everything. You're welcome.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.642
Franny, you got some cleaning coupons,
'cause that's what you do,

01:19.767 --> 01:22.206
and Klaus, you got nothing,
because people think you're dead.

01:22.374 --> 01:26.374
You don't have to say that every time.
You could just not hand me anything.

01:26.707 --> 01:30.319
- Anything for me?
- Yes, you got a nice, little package.

01:30.848 --> 01:32.927
And you also got something
in the mail.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.458
- What is it, Stan?
- This? In the box?

01:38.310 --> 01:41.058
Wrong number. Why do people
always call during dinner?

01:42.292 --> 01:44.895
Wait, Dad, don't you want
to hear my song?

01:46.468 --> 01:49.235
Steve, here's your copy
of <i>Neglected Child Monthly</i>.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.084
Kidding, but how perfect would that be?
You'd be on the cover.

01:53.787 --> 01:54.780
Crying.

01:56.904 --> 01:59.147
So I learned something new
at cello rehearsal today.

01:59.272 --> 02:02.362
You see these things right here?
They're called "F-holes".

02:02.487 --> 02:03.630
F- holes.

02:04.765 --> 02:06.624
- Right?
- Hey, there's Dad.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.512
- What's he doing?
- I bet he's having an affair

02:10.637 --> 02:13.340
with one of those self-storage whores.
Franny, pull over.

02:15.608 --> 02:17.595
- What is this?
- I can explain.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.040
A DeLorean?

02:21.829 --> 02:23.097
Are you running coke?!

02:23.685 --> 02:26.196
I get it. We'll talk later.
I'm good for half a key.

02:26.321 --> 02:29.062
Look, I wanted to keep
the car a secret till it was done.

02:29.500 --> 02:32.709
I've been building it piece by piece
for the last six years.

02:32.834 --> 02:36.029
You've been working on this stupid thing
for six years!

02:36.199 --> 02:38.782
You're gonna hate yourself for that
when you see it in the right light.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.008
Why is Dad building a DeLorean?

02:41.133 --> 02:42.531
Hello? McFly?

02:42.656 --> 02:44.787
It's the car
from <i>Back To The Future</i>.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.312
It's magnificent!

02:49.040 --> 02:51.133
Stan, how much did this cost?

02:51.463 --> 02:54.545
$16,000, plus another three G's
for the lights and fog machine.

02:54.670 --> 02:55.484
What?!

02:56.620 --> 02:59.665
You told me we couldn't afford
the shoulder surgery I need!

02:59.790 --> 03:01.558
All right, calm down,
I'm almost done.

03:01.683 --> 03:03.682
I got the stick shift knob
in the mail today.

03:03.997 --> 03:06.293
All I need now
is the passenger gull wing door

03:06.418 --> 03:07.562
and I am finished.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.832
Six years and $47,000 later.

03:10.957 --> 03:13.150
- What?
- I mean, whatever number I said before.

03:20.936 --> 03:24.008
Francine, I don't want to tell you
what you sound like you're doing.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.156
Pooping.
There. Happy?

03:26.348 --> 03:28.636
- You embarrassed us both.
- I found it!

03:28.761 --> 03:30.931
Found what?
Clearly not your inside voice.

03:31.056 --> 03:32.426
The gull wing door!

03:32.713 --> 03:34.380
The last piece to your DeLorean!

03:34.609 --> 03:37.006
- How? I've looked everywhere!
- Craigslist.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.681
"Craigslist"?
What is that, like Schindler's List?

03:39.806 --> 03:43.316
Somebody ought to tell Craig the Jews
are doing just fine now, excelling even.

03:43.441 --> 03:44.471
It's a Web site.

03:44.596 --> 03:46.653
There's a guy in Albuquerque
who's selling the door.

03:46.778 --> 03:49.852
If you want it, you got to go get it.
It's first come, first serve.

03:50.022 --> 03:53.641
I better get directions. I'll Google Map
the nearest Rand McNally store.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.266
Dad, I was thinking.

03:55.391 --> 03:57.945
- Maybe you'd want some... company?
- Nope.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.409
Stan, maybe you should take Steve.

04:03.606 --> 04:05.256
Steve who?
Guttenberg?

04:05.534 --> 04:07.626
Yeah! Now, that's a road trip.

04:07.751 --> 04:09.731
Picking up tail,
signing autographs...

04:09.856 --> 04:11.826
"All the best.
Love, Mahoney."

04:11.951 --> 04:14.233
No. Steve Smith, your son.

04:15.325 --> 04:16.555
Not so sure, babe.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.868
We don't really connect.
We have nothing in common.

04:18.993 --> 04:21.752
- Wat would we even talk about?
- Ask him about school.

04:21.877 --> 04:24.092
It's the perfect opportunity
to bond.

04:24.217 --> 04:25.423
I don't know.

04:25.739 --> 04:29.661
Either you take Steve, or you sell
that DeLorean, and get me surgery.

04:29.786 --> 04:32.108
Fine. Steve, go pack.
We leave in five.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.796
There they go.

04:38.084 --> 04:41.262
- You know what this means, don't you?
- You bet I do!

04:41.601 --> 04:42.423
What?

04:43.021 --> 04:44.872
What does it mean, Francine?

04:45.682 --> 04:47.808
- I don't know. Sorry.
- That's okay.

04:47.933 --> 04:49.803
You were showing
that you were listening.

04:49.928 --> 04:51.731
It means that with Stan
and Steve gone,

04:51.856 --> 04:53.734
we're going to have
an adventure of our own!

04:53.859 --> 04:56.409
So let's all come up
with three potential escapades,

04:56.534 --> 04:58.484
and meet in an hour to pitch.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.324
You know, I'm having fun already.

05:01.639 --> 05:03.834
I am on a lot of prescription pills,
though.

05:04.710 --> 05:06.010
Is that a story?

05:06.246 --> 05:07.846
No, it's an addiction.

05:18.732 --> 05:19.882
So, school...

05:21.250 --> 05:23.001
School, school, school...

05:24.464 --> 05:25.859
- You go to school?
- Yes.

05:25.984 --> 05:28.053
Excellent.
Have they taught you cursive?

05:28.178 --> 05:30.443
What?
Yes, in third grade.

05:30.748 --> 05:34.292
Good. You're going to need that.
Lot of business takes place in cursive.

05:41.758 --> 05:42.560
So...

05:43.863 --> 05:45.810
you have any brothers or sisters?

05:54.752 --> 05:57.460
- Want to play a game?
- No. Fun is distracting.

05:57.585 --> 05:59.853
- I Spy isn't very fun.
- Fine.

06:01.937 --> 06:04.848
I spy with my little eye
something...

06:05.512 --> 06:06.305
big.

06:06.430 --> 06:08.280
- Is it the desert?
- Yes!

06:08.496 --> 06:10.228
You were right, that wasn't fun.

06:13.260 --> 06:14.610
"Trapeze school"?

06:15.509 --> 06:17.174
Well, zany outfits, circus food,

06:17.299 --> 06:19.541
one of us could really get hurt...
could be fun.

06:19.666 --> 06:22.373
You see, Hayley, that's how
you make the "maybe" pile.

06:22.498 --> 06:24.840
Shouldn't we do
something more meaningful?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.094
Like what?

06:27.274 --> 06:29.518
Well, you know
what would be really fun?

06:29.643 --> 06:32.264
A lot of Central American children
are born with hare lips!

06:32.466 --> 06:34.989
Yes! Freak porn, right? Love it!
We rent a camera,

06:35.114 --> 06:38.857
- go down to Hope Street...
- No, we raise money and awareness.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.750
You know, have fun by doing good.

06:42.688 --> 06:44.069
Let's call it for today.

06:44.290 --> 06:45.904
I thought we were making progress.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.155
I know you did.
See you tomorrow.

06:53.621 --> 06:56.093
Check it out!
A wallet made of rabbit fur.

06:56.340 --> 06:58.541
This must be
what Indian millionaires use.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.405
- Yeah, probably.
- I'm buying this.

07:00.530 --> 07:02.989
- It's my new everyday wallet.
- I don't use a wallet.

07:03.114 --> 07:04.649
I just keep my money loose.

07:05.847 --> 07:07.046
You're not...

07:07.171 --> 07:09.708
you're not worried
about it falling out of your pocket?

07:10.133 --> 07:11.233
No, I'm not.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.154
- How... does that feel, son?
- I don't know, Dad.

07:18.279 --> 07:21.335
I have some reservations
about wearing this.

07:26.383 --> 07:27.727
No junk food, Pop.

07:27.852 --> 07:30.098
We didn't run
the father-son marathon for nothing.

07:30.223 --> 07:32.788
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, son. Peanut me.

07:33.941 --> 07:36.246
Let's hit the road, you old polecat.

07:41.518 --> 07:43.863
Hey, Dad, how about a healthy snack?

07:43.988 --> 07:46.256
- Sure.
- Cottage cheese.

08:11.552 --> 08:14.415
- Sorry about the cottage cheese.
- That's all right.

08:15.046 --> 08:16.348
You old polecat!

08:27.657 --> 08:28.767
Sorry. I...

08:29.842 --> 08:30.875
You know...

08:31.410 --> 08:32.551
Oh, my God.

08:32.852 --> 08:35.746
Guys, guys...
I'm the one who's sorry.

08:35.871 --> 08:38.763
Those bikes were parked
way too close to each other.

08:38.937 --> 08:40.910
Accident waiting to happen.

08:41.035 --> 08:43.188
But it's like my tattoo says.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.872
None of our adventure ideas
are any good.

09:00.064 --> 09:03.991
But I still like my idea of putting
David Blaine in an airless refrigerator.

09:04.116 --> 09:06.155
No, I hate new school street magic.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.743
I like dirty punk magic.
I like Criss Angel.

09:08.868 --> 09:10.268
He freaks my mind.

09:10.539 --> 09:12.695
Filthy little mind-freaker,
that's what he is.

09:14.753 --> 09:17.681
"Crash the French Ambassador's
Masquerade Ball."

09:17.987 --> 09:21.072
And it's this Saturday night.
See that's good, Francine.

09:21.197 --> 09:23.427
- Then it's settled.
- I think I got it.

09:23.567 --> 09:26.063
We start a protest newspaper.

09:28.096 --> 09:30.478
Homerun, Canseco.
Newspaper it is.

09:30.603 --> 09:33.181
Come back to us when you've worked out
literally everything.

09:33.524 --> 09:35.017
<i>Bon voyage</i>, Hayley.

09:47.167 --> 09:49.461
- Want to do one?
- I'll just watch. I don't know how.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.626
- You don't know how to blow a bubble?
- And you don't know how to make love.

09:52.751 --> 09:54.941
So not everyone knows
how to do everything, okay?

09:55.066 --> 09:56.979
I'll teach you.
Here, chew.

09:58.921 --> 09:59.723
Now what?

09:59.936 --> 10:02.349
I want you to flatten
that gum out into a sheet.

10:05.318 --> 10:07.994
Now, take that sheet
and pretend it's a ghost costume,

10:08.119 --> 10:10.734
and you're dressing your tongue up
to go out trick-or-treating.

10:12.266 --> 10:13.266
All right.

10:13.998 --> 10:17.103
Okay, I want you to blow
a very gentle channel of air

10:17.228 --> 10:18.657
into the ghost costume.

10:21.646 --> 10:22.912
You're doing it!

10:23.364 --> 10:24.585
All right, slow down.

10:24.710 --> 10:26.875
Reel it back in.
Reel it, reel it back in!

10:27.619 --> 10:28.418
My eyes!

10:29.360 --> 10:30.627
Get it off! Get it off!

10:30.797 --> 10:31.880
Dad! The road!

10:32.629 --> 10:33.629
What? What?

10:48.469 --> 10:50.610
My heart is beating out of my chest.

10:50.871 --> 10:53.521
I saw the face of God
in that pink sticky.

10:53.724 --> 10:55.486
- Now what?
- We need some help.

10:57.385 --> 10:58.280
You da man.

10:59.615 --> 11:02.441
Hello, friend. As you can see,
we're in a bit of a bind...

11:02.566 --> 11:04.520
You askew my mirror.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.078
- I what now?
- I askew yours.

11:08.012 --> 11:09.012
There.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.335
Balance.

11:10.845 --> 11:12.257
Yin. Yang.

11:19.892 --> 11:21.542
That was not my intent.

11:22.744 --> 11:24.312
<i>Sayonara</i>, butt face!

11:30.273 --> 11:32.282
Tonight is going to be so much fun.

11:32.407 --> 11:34.379
I feel like the belle of the ball!

11:34.504 --> 11:37.737
Yeah, well, I'm the belle of the ball,
so you can feel however you want.

11:40.457 --> 11:42.569
You started an adventure without me?

11:42.694 --> 11:44.868
- Why wouldn't you include me?
- You're no fun.

11:45.152 --> 11:46.828
What?
I'm fun!

11:48.077 --> 11:50.381
You, you sweet, man-faced girl.

11:50.506 --> 11:51.723
You're not fun.

11:51.848 --> 11:54.857
I was having fun, and then I saw you
and my fun went soft.

11:55.063 --> 11:56.352
Forget you guys!

12:00.873 --> 12:02.436
<i>Elle est dérangée avec nous.</i>

12:02.561 --> 12:03.454
<i>Ouais!</i>

12:06.392 --> 12:07.952
Okay, we still have money.

12:08.077 --> 12:10.340
We'll hitchhike to the next town
and rent a car.

12:10.465 --> 12:11.771
We'll still get that door.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.558
Stay back!
No sudden movements!

12:16.744 --> 12:18.549
- What are you doing?
- Saving us!

12:18.674 --> 12:20.443
Haven't you ever
heard of a trouser snake?

12:20.568 --> 12:22.466
I don't think you have that quite...

12:29.983 --> 12:31.083
I'll get it.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.104
Got it!

12:39.101 --> 12:40.301
What the hell?

12:44.666 --> 12:47.299
There's so much crime in the desert!

12:55.643 --> 12:58.379
Not sure if anyone's going
to pick up a half-naked 42-year-old

12:58.504 --> 13:00.100
and his young boy companion.

13:00.267 --> 13:02.310
- Just sayin'.
- This is all your fault.

13:02.435 --> 13:05.559
We're in this whole mess because of you
and your stupid bubblegum lesson.

13:05.684 --> 13:09.119
We're in this mess because you punched
me into that Asian guy's mirror!

13:09.370 --> 13:11.913
Well, you practically handed
my rabbit wallet to that hawk!

13:12.522 --> 13:14.198
This whole trip was a bad idea!

13:14.323 --> 13:17.146
I thought we could bond,
but clearly that's impossible.

13:17.565 --> 13:19.561
It's not my fault
we have nothing in common.

13:19.686 --> 13:20.786
Sure, we do.

13:20.911 --> 13:22.924
We both clearly like
<i>Back To The Future</i>.

13:23.209 --> 13:25.494
- What's that?
- <i>Back To The Future</i>!

13:25.729 --> 13:27.305
The classic time-traveling comedy?

13:27.585 --> 13:30.287
Never heard of it.
You know I hate time-based comedies.

13:30.412 --> 13:32.483
<i>Mannequin 2</i>
being the obvious exception.

13:32.608 --> 13:34.588
Then why are you building
a DeLorean?

13:34.713 --> 13:36.836
Because I always admired
John DeLorean.

13:37.056 --> 13:39.706
The man had a magnificent chin
and a dream.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.611
To build a car company
from the ground up.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.376
I just wanted to capture
a little piece of that magic.

13:45.501 --> 13:47.200
Make something I could be proud of.

13:49.940 --> 13:51.809
I guess it was a stupid dream.

13:51.934 --> 13:54.319
No, Dad. It's not a stupid dream.

13:54.499 --> 13:56.885
It's a good dream.
And it's your dream.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.943
And that guy's dream.

14:02.068 --> 14:03.370
He's after our door!

14:03.495 --> 14:05.551
We've got to beat him to it!
Come on!

14:13.172 --> 14:15.789
Son, I've been at the CIA
for 20 years.

14:15.914 --> 14:17.966
Never ruffled any feathers,
always done my job.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.890
In doing so,
I've collected exactly two favors.

14:24.903 --> 14:25.953
That's one.

14:27.111 --> 14:28.111
And two.

14:29.810 --> 14:33.621
- What are you doing? Get in!
- Just a sec. This is going to be good!

14:34.040 --> 14:35.873
- Come on!
- Go! Go!

14:55.535 --> 14:57.880
You going to be all right
if I catch a couple Z's, Pop?

14:58.005 --> 15:00.371
- Pretty sleepy.
- Go ahead, bud. Don't worry about me.

15:00.496 --> 15:02.496
I'm fueled by pure adrenaline.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.152
I'm just going to rest my eyes.

15:16.158 --> 15:17.608
Hey, look who's up.

15:21.779 --> 15:24.302
Andy? Oh, my God, Andy!

15:25.180 --> 15:27.149
Are you okay?
What happened?

15:27.505 --> 15:29.155
Can you move your neck?

15:29.645 --> 15:30.783
Oh, God!

15:32.553 --> 15:34.925
I wanted to win, but not like this.

15:35.472 --> 15:37.083
We had different approaches, sure,

15:37.208 --> 15:40.162
but I always respected
the hell out of you!

15:42.068 --> 15:43.111
Oh! My buddy!

15:43.969 --> 15:45.169
You know what?

15:46.462 --> 15:48.368
We are going to finish this...

15:49.013 --> 15:49.918
together.

15:52.656 --> 15:54.527
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

15:57.527 --> 15:58.527
Let's go.

16:04.274 --> 16:06.724
Cut it out, Roger.
Tonight was a bust.

16:06.849 --> 16:09.338
We were the only ones
in period costumes,

16:09.463 --> 16:11.802
and your gibberish got me
punched in the boob.

16:13.162 --> 16:15.973
- At least we're more fun than Hayley.
- Oh, really?

16:16.316 --> 16:18.142
Why don't you open the fridge?

16:20.524 --> 16:21.826
David Blaine!

16:22.047 --> 16:23.568
You used my idea.

16:26.339 --> 16:27.314
He's dead.

16:27.439 --> 16:29.910
Oh, my God!
He said he could hold his breath!

16:30.157 --> 16:34.107
I'm sorry. You are fun, Hayley.
I'm going to kick him.

16:35.116 --> 16:36.514
Criss Angel!

16:36.639 --> 16:38.777
You freaked my mind,
you filthy punk!

16:38.902 --> 16:40.125
Come see my room.

16:47.984 --> 16:50.370
Great Scott!
That door is mine!

16:50.495 --> 16:52.176
I've been looking for it for years!

16:52.519 --> 16:55.954
I don't know what you're talking about.
My dad and I are just headed to Santa Fe

16:56.079 --> 16:58.431
to sell our unique collection
of turquoise jewelry.

16:58.556 --> 17:01.644
You know the Navajo believe
that turquoise... Floor it, Dad!

17:07.233 --> 17:09.960
We got to get this DeLorean
up to 88 miles an hour.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.667
- You did see the movie.
- What?

17:12.792 --> 17:14.912
No, that's as fast as this car goes.

17:15.037 --> 17:16.909
Not very powerful.
Neat looking, though.

17:40.910 --> 17:43.500
Take it easy out there,
Mr. Smith, Mr. Kerkhoff.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.189
I mean, what kind of a rush
could you two be in?

17:46.337 --> 17:48.037
You're in time machines.

17:48.532 --> 17:50.315
You got all the time you need.

17:53.027 --> 17:54.238
I don't get it.

17:55.073 --> 17:57.086
Hey, that's not your DeLorean.

17:57.853 --> 17:59.046
My mistake.

18:00.169 --> 18:01.169
Butthead.

18:04.664 --> 18:06.564
Thanks! I need one of these!

18:07.966 --> 18:08.966
Oh, my God!

18:13.689 --> 18:15.047
I can't win like this.

18:15.172 --> 18:17.094
I feel like I'm shaking hands
with a cat.

18:17.466 --> 18:19.972
Get next to him!
He's not getting away with this!

18:27.060 --> 18:28.105
The Libyans!

18:34.639 --> 18:37.094
I believe this belongs to my dad.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.494
Hey, son. Knob me!

18:49.466 --> 18:50.713
That was awesome!

18:51.564 --> 18:54.120
Do not tell your mom I let you jump
from a moving car.

18:54.464 --> 18:56.014
Twice. Really. Steve?

18:56.233 --> 18:58.016
Look at me.
Not a word.

19:02.685 --> 19:03.474
Damn!

19:12.573 --> 19:14.191
You guys here for the desk?

19:14.316 --> 19:16.943
- No, we're here for the DeLorean door.
- You sure?

19:17.418 --> 19:18.762
It's a nice desk.

19:19.996 --> 19:22.784
- You here for the desk?
- No, I'm here for the door.

19:24.388 --> 19:27.402
Well, these two were here first.
The door's theirs.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.574
Yes, I can't believe it!
We did it!

19:29.699 --> 19:32.271
We did it! We won!
It's over!

19:40.515 --> 19:42.922
You know what, old stuff?
Let him have it.

19:43.047 --> 19:44.694
- What?
- Go ahead.

19:50.730 --> 19:52.013
Dad, what are you doing?

19:52.138 --> 19:54.495
See that guy over there
dry humping the door?

19:54.728 --> 19:56.417
- You know where he's going?
- No.

19:56.542 --> 19:59.349
Neither does he.
But we know where we're going.

19:59.637 --> 20:01.403
To find another door.

20:05.386 --> 20:08.613
Don't you see, son?
Finding DeLorean doors is our thing.

20:10.464 --> 20:11.683
I guess it is.

20:11.808 --> 20:13.919
Of course it is, you old polecat!

20:18.781 --> 20:21.283
Sorry. Now, to keep
our cool factor at ten,

20:21.408 --> 20:23.347
I'm going to pull her around,
go real slow,

20:23.472 --> 20:25.356
and you just hop in
when it feels right.

20:33.350 --> 20:34.983
Gunned it prematurely.
I'm sorry.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.836
Hang on. Coming back around.
Keep the dream alive.

20:44.946 --> 20:46.046
There we go.

20:56.860 --> 20:58.231
We did it, Andy!

20:58.944 --> 21:00.544
We did it, old friend!
