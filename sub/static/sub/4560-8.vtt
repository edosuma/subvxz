I don't agree with you.
- No, really, it was.

12:06.256 --> 12:10.730
- I mean, my mum's a great cook,
but the yelling...
- I'm not talking about you!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.502
Listen, I know my fans,

12:12.502 --> 12:14.434
and I know they'd love
me to sing this song.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.437
OK. Tell you what.

12:17.437 --> 12:22.012
You think you're right,
I think I'm right. There's
only one way to decide this.

12:22.012 --> 12:24.314
- Defer to the artist.
- Ladies choice.

12:24.314 --> 12:28.849
- Rock, Paper, Scissors?
- No, no and... yes.

12:28.849 --> 12:32.422
- Really?
- No! We'll have a focus group.

12:32.422 --> 12:35.525
We bring in ten randomly
selected Hannah Montana fans.

12:35.525 --> 12:38.388
And if more than half
of them like the song,

12:38.388 --> 12:40.530
then you have
your bonus track.

12:42.262 --> 12:46.136
No, no, no, no.
That's a terrible idea.

12:46.136 --> 12:48.999
[scoffs] One stupid focus group

12:48.999 --> 12:52.402
was all it took to sink
my Robby Ray Raps record.

Who says a hillbilly
can't bust a rhyme?

12:55.405 --> 13:00.010

it was 96 out of 100.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.552
Yeah, but the other four
thought I was funkalicious...

13:02.552 --> 13:06.056

- Nose picker!
