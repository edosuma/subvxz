00:35.702 --> 00:42.207
Tomorrow, and tomorrow,
         and tomorrow...

00:43.643 --> 00:47.713
    creeps in this petty pace
         from day to day

00:47.715 --> 00:51.216
      to the last syllable
      of recorded time,

00:51.218 --> 00:53.752
     and all our yesterdays

00:53.754 --> 00:58.290
have lighted fools
the way to dusty death.

01:03.630 --> 01:08.734
    Out, out, brief candle.

01:08.736 --> 01:12.037
  Life's but a walking shadow,

01:15.108 --> 01:21.280
a poor player that struts and
frets his hour upon the stage

01:21.282 --> 01:24.516
   and then is heard no more.

01:26.686 --> 01:30.122
        It is a tale
        told by an idiot

01:30.124 --> 01:33.425
    full of sound and fury,

01:33.427 --> 01:36.728
      signifying nothing.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.032
Do it again!

02:50.036 --> 02:52.237
    Put this
    where it can't be found.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.773
Well, that'd
be nowhere, then.

02:54.775 --> 02:55.874
            Quickly.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.877
Neighbors are
cooking bacon again.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.012
Beckett!

03:00.014 --> 03:01.213
            Samuel!

03:06.352 --> 03:08.387
          It's Daddy.

03:09.889 --> 03:14.526
Well, good morning,
      boys.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.565
       Do you smell that?

03:19.567 --> 03:24.503
       Nothing like
       the smell of bacon
       in the morning.

03:25.238 --> 03:27.039
         What is
         for breakfast?

03:27.041 --> 03:28.907
        Doughnut holes.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.242
       Where's the money?

03:30.244 --> 03:31.710
          What money?

03:31.712 --> 03:32.911
          Oh, don't
          bullshit me,
          Beckett.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.313
       I gave you
       everything I had.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.781
         Well, then
         we're fucked.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.183
       Heh. No, you mean
       you're fucked.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.419
         I'm fucked.
         You're fucked.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.620
       We're all fucked.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.122
     It's not about
     the pronoun, Beckett.

03:44.124 --> 03:47.826
Where were you
last night, Dad?
You promised.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.394
              God.

03:49.396 --> 03:53.732
    I was doing
    the best I can
    to support you two boys

03:53.734 --> 03:56.001
         is where I was
         last night.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.536
           All right?

03:58.104 --> 04:02.174
     W-W-What's this, huh?
     What's this?!

04:02.176 --> 04:04.076
     No, wait. That's mine.
     You can't have that.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.812
     No, nothing is yours,
     nothing. You got that?

04:06.814 --> 04:07.879
      Do you think reading
      this shite

04:07.881 --> 04:10.515
     is any good for you
     and your brother, huh?

04:10.517 --> 04:11.850
            Do you?

04:13.086 --> 04:15.254
    Get dressed.
    You're going to be late.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.622
              Go.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.398
I know you all,

04:26.400 --> 04:31.670
and will awhile uphold
the unyoked honor
of your idleness.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.673
           Yet herein
     will I imitate the sun,

04:34.675 --> 04:37.609
         who doth permit
     base contagious clouds

04:37.611 --> 04:40.512
    to smother up his beauty
         from the world.

04:47.587 --> 04:48.754
             What?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.689
             Go on.

04:53.993 --> 04:56.561
      When again he please
      to be himself,

04:56.563 --> 04:58.764
        by breaking
        through the foul
        and ugly mists--

04:58.766 --> 05:00.699
Being wanted, he may be
more wondered at--

05:00.701 --> 05:03.001
You think those idiots
     are gonna notice?

05:03.003 --> 05:07.039
That, when he please
again to be himself,

05:07.041 --> 05:11.143
being wanted,
he may be more wondered at

05:11.145 --> 05:13.812
by breaking through
the foul and ugly mists--

05:13.814 --> 05:16.014
     They're not gonna tell
     if I miss a--

05:16.716 --> 05:18.817
But you will know,

05:18.819 --> 05:21.853
and then you'll lose focus,
and you'll trip up.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.055
Do it again!

05:23.856 --> 05:28.226
Being wanted, he may
      be more wondered at

05:28.228 --> 05:33.398
      by breaking through
      the foul and ugly
      mists of vapors

05:33.400 --> 05:36.435
        that had seemed
        to strangle him.

05:37.236 --> 05:38.837
You're good.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.339
Heh heh.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.711
But at your age,
I was better.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.038
    Did you see that punk
    giving you the stink-eye
    on the bus?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.840
               No.
       Could've taken him.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.576
Oh, yeah? Where'd you
have taken him?

06:27.521 --> 06:32.057
       Right.
       This should do it.

06:33.626 --> 06:37.496
You're good,
but at your age,
I was better.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.964
The world is
       grown so bad

06:38.966 --> 06:43.568
     that wrens
     make prey where eagles
     dare not perch.

06:45.004 --> 06:49.941
     And since every jack's
     been made a gentlemen,

06:49.943 --> 06:53.779
        there's many
        a gentle person
        made a jack.

06:53.781 --> 06:57.883
     I do the wrong, and
     first begin to brawl.

06:57.885 --> 07:01.286
      My secret mischiefs
      I set abroach

07:01.288 --> 07:04.790
      I lay unto
      the grievous charge
      of others.

07:07.326 --> 07:09.561
    And now they believe it.

07:18.905 --> 07:23.675
      And thus I clothe
      my naked villainy--

07:23.677 --> 07:31.049
      heh--with old
      odd ends stole forth
      out of Holy Writ...

07:33.319 --> 07:35.987
        and seem a saint

07:35.989 --> 07:38.557
       when most
       I play the devil.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.767
Thank you.

07:48.769 --> 07:49.835
           Excuse me.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.837
           Excuse me.

08:02.582 --> 08:03.949
           Thank you.

08:20.766 --> 08:23.602
Listen, just keep
kicking him in the nuts.

08:23.604 --> 08:27.906
Drag your keys across
his face, and just keep
kicking him in the nuts.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.208
All right,
you got this.
You can do this.

08:30.210 --> 08:34.946
       Beckett, Miranda,
       are you ready?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.481
           All right.

08:36.482 --> 08:37.414
      It's late at night,

08:37.417 --> 08:40.251
    and you're walking
    down a deserted street.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.986
       Now start walking.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.355
            Oh, boy.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.892
              Hey!

08:46.894 --> 08:48.660
    You all will not be here
    to save her.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.728
Look at me.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.997
          Let's do it
          again, okay?

08:51.999 --> 08:53.865
          Let's do it
          again, okay?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.534
             Okay.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.702
Kick him
in the nuts.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.304
             Okay.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.109
              No!

09:04.111 --> 09:06.711
Get his ass!
 I said no!

09:06.713 --> 09:07.913
           I said no!

09:07.915 --> 09:10.815
             No! No!
              Yes!

09:12.251 --> 09:13.418
       That's what
       I'm talking about.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.154
       That's what
       I'm talking about.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.994
You dropped this
in there.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.263
        Ah, thanks, man.

09:32.506 --> 09:36.007
I wish I had a bunch
of women trying to beat
the crap out of me.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.376
       Oh, you saw that,
       Little Larry?
       Pretty cool, huh?

09:38.378 --> 09:40.045
Yeah. Well, I was
watching the class.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.047
I saw you take off
that Darth Vader costume.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.950
I thought, "Holy shit.
That's Beckett Emerson."

09:44.952 --> 09:45.717
         Did you, now?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.252
Those chicks are
pretty hot, huh?

09:47.254 --> 09:51.122
      Uh, actually, a lot
      of 'em been through
      a lot, man.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.324
Yeah. So you
could take advantage

09:52.326 --> 09:55.360
of their, uh, vulnerability.
Know what I mean?

09:55.362 --> 09:56.895
    Vulnerability isn't hot.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.597
          Hot is hot.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.398
You wanna hang out?

10:00.400 --> 10:01.733
     You know, I'd love to,

10:01.735 --> 10:03.501
     but, uh,
     I'm really busy, man.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.570
Ah, yeah. I gotta
be somewhere, too.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.306
     My next bus leaves
     in five minutes, so--

10:10.077 --> 10:11.509
You're still taking
the bus?

10:11.511 --> 10:13.578
You were
the super boy geek.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.413
I thought
you'd have a cush job

10:15.415 --> 10:17.983
doing, uh, computer science
or something by now.

10:17.985 --> 10:22.487
     Yeah. Well, yeah, I do
     have the perfect job.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.989
Holy shit.

10:25.091 --> 10:26.591
What do you do?

10:26.593 --> 10:28.593
     I'll have to tell you
     another time.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.195
All right.
Come on. Come on, man.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.796
Look, listen.
Come on, get back here.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.498
I--I want to know
what you do.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.567
      You were in a hurry,
      remember?

10:52.119 --> 10:56.221
Not bad, 500 bucks
and a snakeskin wallet.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.758
      You know the rules.
      No wallets.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.959
It's snakeskin.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.594
         Come on, Beck.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.763
All right,
I'll burn it
with the rest.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.598
       How much we gonna
       give to him?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.433
A hundred, maybe two.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.901
     We gotta pay the rent.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.002
Yeah, well, Rizzo can wait.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.237
      What, you want
      to move house again?

11:12.239 --> 11:14.406
    You know he's just gonna
    blow it all at the races

11:14.408 --> 11:16.775
  or on his drink,
  whichever he gets to first.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.677
    Hey, he wins sometimes,
    you know.

11:18.679 --> 11:19.377
Come on, now.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.881
     Anyways, I figured out
     how to buy the house.

11:23.449 --> 11:27.652
So, we make money
out of money. All right?

11:27.654 --> 11:30.955
First thing to do
is invest in real estate.

11:30.957 --> 11:33.525
If the house
is worth 220K,

11:33.527 --> 11:34.659
10% down is 22K.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.061
With a loan
at 4.5 interest rate,

11:36.063 --> 11:39.698
we'd be paying less
in rent than we are now.
Dad would be set.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.832
       You're completely
       delusional.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.200
       We don't have shit
       to invest.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.868
We just haven't tried
to save enough yet.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.238
      No matter
      where you put it,
      he's gonna find it.

11:48.107 --> 11:52.077
You're just
pissed off 'cause he
took your fricking comic.

11:54.580 --> 11:57.348
     You know, outrun time,
     that would be it.

11:57.350 --> 12:00.351
     Racing along
     like the Phantom Halo.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.588
       Then we could
       just disappear
       to another place.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.857
There is no other place.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.026
     The Phantom Halo used
     his radioactive powers

12:08.028 --> 12:09.294
     to break himself free
     from the mud

12:09.296 --> 12:11.362
     that had trapped him
     for millions of years.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.397
        We're--We're not
        in the mud.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.765
      We're up
      to our necks in it.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.534
      You know,
      we could harness it
      like the Halo did.

12:16.536 --> 12:17.435
You know, it's official.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.938
That comic book is
co-opting your brain.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.139
What the...

12:30.516 --> 12:35.587
How's my favorite
little rats doing today?

12:35.589 --> 12:36.821
      Rizzo, what up, man?

12:36.823 --> 12:38.523
You locked us out?
     Zip it.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.993
Word's on the street
your dad's in pretty deep.

12:41.995 --> 12:42.927
       How much you need?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.763
All of it.
The rent's late.

12:44.765 --> 12:45.563
         How 'bout 350?

12:45.565 --> 12:47.966
How about I have my boy
Ronnie pay you a visit?

12:47.968 --> 12:49.334
And before
you can count to 10,

12:49.336 --> 12:53.404
he'll have all your shit
sitting out on the sidewalk.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.673
The hood
could take their piece,

12:55.675 --> 12:57.876
and you'll wind up empty.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.979
Yeah.
Move all that this way.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.281
Ah, all of it.

13:10.823 --> 13:14.259
       My shoes sure
       could use a shine.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.960
Fuck you.

13:23.702 --> 13:25.103
Do not polish his shoes.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.871
     I only did that once.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.106
I'll kill him.

13:49.295 --> 13:50.261
         Hey, hey, hey.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.997
         What the hell
         is this, huh?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.098
              Huh?

13:56.302 --> 13:57.735
       I know
       what you're up to.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.305
    You don't try
    getting big on me, huh?

14:02.241 --> 14:04.342
        Eat it. Eat it.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.080
    You do what you're told.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.682
        Now swallow it.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.953
Swallow it.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.788
       That's a good boy.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.723
         I'm gonna get
         some sleep.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.092
       You be a good boy.

14:29.435 --> 14:30.969
             Fuck.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.412
I know you all,

14:41.414 --> 14:46.217
     and will awhile uphold
     the unyoked honor
     of your...

14:46.219 --> 14:47.585
           idleness.

14:47.587 --> 14:51.222
     And, like bright metal
     on a sullen ground,

14:51.224 --> 14:54.592
        my reformation,
        glittering over
        my thoughts,

14:54.594 --> 14:57.228
      shall be seen to be
      more goodly

14:57.230 --> 14:59.864
      and attract
      more eyes than that

14:59.866 --> 15:02.567
     which hath
     no foil to set it off.

15:02.569 --> 15:07.639
       I shall so offend
       to make offense
       a skill...

15:09.008 --> 15:14.712
         redeeming time
         when men think
         least I will.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.080
        Thank you, guys.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.189
           Thank you.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.324
            Thanks.

15:38.370 --> 15:41.339
Where'd you learn
       to do that, kid?

15:41.341 --> 15:42.740
Hard to say, really.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.642
       What's your name?

15:44.644 --> 15:47.111
Samuel.
Samuel.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.981
    You know, you remind me
    of a once-dear friend.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.683
Yeah?
Yeah.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.117
He perform
around here?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.552
          No, no, no.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.920
      West End of London.

15:55.922 --> 15:59.324
        Those were
        his playgrounds.

16:00.993 --> 16:04.128
       You know,
       let me do my bit.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.464
              Heh.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.433
              Oh.

16:11.737 --> 16:12.770
        Good luck, huh?

16:12.772 --> 16:15.406
       You look
       like you need it.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.379
I am a villain.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.748
           Yet I lie.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.549
           I am not.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.719
       Methought the souls
   of all that I had murdered

16:27.721 --> 16:30.421
        came to my tent;
    and every one did threat

16:30.423 --> 16:33.691
    tomorrow's vengeance
    on the head of Richard.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.644
        Whiskey, please.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.114
Warren.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.081
        Hello, darling.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.238
And the rest?

17:25.243 --> 17:27.878
       Buy a thirsty man
       a drink?

17:27.881 --> 17:29.247
It's short.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.748
       I had a bad night.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.583
Yeah, and it's
only just begun.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.853
       Now what we've--
       What we have, we--

17:35.855 --> 17:37.622
      What we have, we...

17:37.624 --> 17:42.727
    What we have,
    we clothe not to
    the worth of the world.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.396
     We enjoy it, but until
     lacked and lost.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.497
Speak plain English.

17:46.499 --> 17:50.401
You know it only
costs four cents
to make a $100 bill?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.003
      Oh, yeah? Did you
      know that the bills

17:52.005 --> 17:54.939
     were made exclusively
     by Crane Paper,

17:54.941 --> 17:59.744
    chock-full of wood pulp,
    cotton, silk, and linen.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.712
You have to tell
the whole world
what you know,

18:01.714 --> 18:04.749
and yet you can't
even pay your debts.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.151
       I've made good
       in the past
       every single time.

18:07.153 --> 18:10.054
Yeah. You were
playing with puddles.

18:10.056 --> 18:13.624
Now you're
in the deep end,

18:13.626 --> 18:16.027
and it turns out
you can't swim.

18:16.029 --> 18:17.495
          I can swim.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.731
You look like
a drowning man to me.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.807
          I can swim.

18:39.318 --> 18:40.618
            Damn it!

18:44.556 --> 18:48.326
We need the ingredients,
butter, flour, eggs.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.961
       So go buy it then.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.797
He found
the new hiding place.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.133
      The son of a bitch.

18:57.002 --> 19:00.238
Look, I'll--I'll figure
this out, all right?

19:29.168 --> 19:31.702
        You didn't have
        what I needed.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.803
           So sorry.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.706
Say hello to Grace
for me, by the way.

19:49.288 --> 19:50.821
        What day is it?

19:50.823 --> 19:52.156
      November 20th, Dad.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.492
      Oh, Christ almighty.

19:58.897 --> 20:00.031
       Look, Dad, you got
       all the stuff.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.566
    You even left the butter
    out and everything.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.001
Yeah, yeah. You don't need
to tell me what I did.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.736
I did it,
so I--I guess I know.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.171
     What the hell
     happened to your foot?

20:07.173 --> 20:10.808
I cut myself shaving.
What do you think?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.076
             Uh...

20:12.078 --> 20:13.110
All right, out.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.712
Get out so I
can do my work. Out.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.913
           All right.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.529
That's it.

20:52.986 --> 20:53.751
Cut the cake.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.486
          She might
          still come.

21:06.632 --> 21:07.498
Cut the cake.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.968
     Can we just
     wait another
     five minutes, please?

21:40.565 --> 21:42.233
      You both lied to me.

21:42.235 --> 21:45.036
Come on.
You were just a young boy

21:45.038 --> 21:46.871
who needed
to believe that--

21:46.873 --> 21:48.272
Oh, come on.
Don't tell me

21:48.274 --> 21:50.474
you--you didn't know
what was going on.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.242
         I didn't know.

21:51.244 --> 21:54.312
Well, then I should have
told you the truth.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.713
        I will find her.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.316
Oh, you will go places
in the world, my boy,

21:58.318 --> 22:01.952
but I doubt
a bus pass will get you
to that woman's abode,

22:01.954 --> 22:03.554
wherever
the hell she is.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.889
              Dad.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.695
Who's there?
  Mr. Lee.

22:10.697 --> 22:11.629
Mr. Lee.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.964
You boys haven't
been stupid, have you?

22:18.704 --> 22:21.539
Mr. Lee, how the hell
have you been?

22:21.541 --> 22:23.174
Uh, would you like a beer?

22:23.176 --> 22:25.543
         Makes my face
         turn red.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.511
Oh, some whiskey, then?

22:34.052 --> 22:39.023
         Milk, flour,
         three eggs...

22:40.258 --> 22:41.559
            butter.

22:46.465 --> 22:47.331
           I did it.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.100
You know the rules.

22:49.102 --> 22:52.470
We don't steal
from this neighborhood!

23:13.359 --> 23:15.326
"Think and Grow Rich."

23:15.328 --> 23:18.062
You got to have one
before you get the other?

23:19.231 --> 23:20.731
      This guy thinks so.

23:22.534 --> 23:25.202
Well, what do you think?

23:25.204 --> 23:28.439
     It's more complicated
     than that.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.143
You know,
I've seen your brother
doing Shakespeare,

23:32.145 --> 23:34.011
even given him
a few dollars.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.914
      I don't have
      a brother down here.

23:39.818 --> 23:40.718
Beckett.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.154
    How do you know my name?

23:44.189 --> 23:45.990
My name is Roman,

23:45.992 --> 23:48.559
an old friend
of your father's.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.395
He ever mention my name?

23:51.397 --> 23:52.496
       My father's dead.

23:52.498 --> 23:54.098
No, he's not.

23:54.100 --> 23:58.736
Just a lousy father,
but he's not dead.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.137
              Sit.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.278
Now we're going
to speak like men,

24:07.280 --> 24:08.979
honest.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.450
      I know
      exactly who you are.

24:12.452 --> 24:16.620
I like your father.
I like him very much,

24:16.622 --> 24:19.890
but he owes me
a lot of money.

24:20.692 --> 24:24.094
So I thought, "Beckett,
he'll know what to do.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.630
He runs
the whole household."

24:26.632 --> 24:28.699
I need it back.

24:28.701 --> 24:29.800
Two weeks.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.602
           How much?

24:31.604 --> 24:33.037
38,000.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.372
              No.

24:35.374 --> 24:36.440
             Yeah.

24:36.442 --> 24:38.442
He came to me with 25,

24:38.444 --> 24:40.344
had been on a good run.

24:40.346 --> 24:41.145
I matched his 25.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.414
      Where the fuck
      did he get $25,000?

24:43.416 --> 24:46.450
Now, that's a question
for him, isn't it?

24:47.719 --> 24:49.854
If you can't get me my money,

24:49.856 --> 24:55.125
I'm going to have to have
a different conversation
with Samuel.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.174
      You and Donny
      been getting along?

25:10.176 --> 25:12.743
          He seems
          disgruntled.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.847
        I'm sorry.
        What'd you say?

25:16.849 --> 25:20.851
       Larry, when I say
       something and you
       don't listen,

25:20.853 --> 25:23.454
       it makes me feel--

25:23.456 --> 25:25.923
         I don't know--
         invisible.

25:25.925 --> 25:29.627
    No, you're the opposite
    of invisible.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.929
What are you
doing here?

25:31.931 --> 25:34.231
     I didn't have
     your cellphone number.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.634
Um, this is Beckett.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.703
This is Ms. Rose.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.608
       I should cover up.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.878
     Seems like most people
     in this world

25:47.880 --> 25:49.713
    welcome company, but...

25:50.949 --> 25:52.750
     well,
     we aren't most people.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.218
Who the hell is this?

25:54.220 --> 25:55.819
       I'm here
       to clean the pool.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.523
         He's just
         an old friend,
         Donny.

25:59.525 --> 26:02.059
       We were altar boys
       together.

26:02.827 --> 26:05.095
     You should go back
     to being an altar boy,

26:05.097 --> 26:07.064
  'cause you did
  a shitty job with the pool.

26:07.066 --> 26:12.570
    Why don't you boys, uh,
    go polish your chalice
    or something

26:12.572 --> 26:14.672
        so I could focus
        on my Rosie here

26:14.674 --> 26:19.376
       in our dirty,
       dirty little pool?

26:19.378 --> 26:20.578
Donny.

26:20.580 --> 26:23.414
     We were just
     having a conversation
     with my ma, Donny.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.883
        Now you're not,
        so scoot.

26:26.985 --> 26:29.753
     All right, Ma.
     We're gonna head out.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.961
    It was nice to meet you,
    Ms. Rose.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.763
     Maybe we can take
     this up another time.

26:39.765 --> 26:44.335
  I don't see that happening,
  as I rarely think
  of the past.

26:48.474 --> 26:49.840
             Okay.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.848
Hey, what happened
to your eye, man?

26:57.850 --> 27:00.985
         Nothing.
         So what's up?

27:00.987 --> 27:03.954
It's another time.

27:03.956 --> 27:04.788
             What?

27:04.790 --> 27:06.790
Where'd you get
the cash, man?

27:06.792 --> 27:10.260
    That was Monopoly money.
    I was just showing off.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.996
It was real. Come on.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.264
      Heh. Stand in line.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.899
There is no line,
brother.

27:15.901 --> 27:18.636
      And you think I got
      something for you?

27:18.638 --> 27:21.205
I think you got a shiner,
and you ain't
telling me shit.

27:21.207 --> 27:25.209
I also think you
need someone, someone
that's got your back.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.045
     I got enough trouble.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.780
Come on, man.
We all got trouble.

27:29.782 --> 27:34.418
Hey, how come you didn't
tell me your mom looks
like a movie star?

27:34.420 --> 27:35.285
      'Cause she's my mom.

27:35.287 --> 27:39.156
      What?
      She's always looked
      like a movie star.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.290
              Hey,

27:40.292 --> 27:42.459
       you want to get us
       some girls?

27:42.461 --> 27:43.961
Why don't you get
your own girls?

27:43.963 --> 27:49.066
    'Cause they won't be
    as good as the ones
    you get us, you scammer.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.770
It's a two-way street.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.505
           All right.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.807
         She's really,
         really pretty,

27:56.809 --> 27:58.509
      I'll think about it.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.144
             Okay.

28:00.879 --> 28:04.448
Yeah. First we
need to get you
some new clothes, though.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.718
       My favorite shirt.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.674
          Where's Dad?

28:30.676 --> 28:31.775
I don't know.

28:31.777 --> 28:33.844
         You should get
         some sleep.

28:34.479 --> 28:35.512
Oh, I need some parts.

28:35.514 --> 28:36.647
       Don't look at me.

28:36.649 --> 28:37.681
        I'm not stealing
        any parts.

28:37.683 --> 28:39.383
Come on.
Just the carburetor.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.152
        Out of my realm
        of expertise.

28:45.590 --> 28:46.590
You're no help.

28:46.592 --> 28:48.625
        Get some sleep.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.366
       I don't know what
       we're doing here,

28:56.368 --> 28:59.403
       but thank you
       for including me,
       by the way.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.671
Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

29:00.673 --> 29:02.906
Want to see
a magic trick?

29:04.342 --> 29:05.442
            Why not?

29:05.444 --> 29:06.710
All right,
take this hundred.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.213
Buy a pack of gum.
Bring me back the change.

29:09.215 --> 29:12.349
And don't buy
that fruity shit.
I hate fruity gum.

29:28.633 --> 29:30.134
How you doing?

29:32.003 --> 29:33.771
          That's 1.75.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.740
      That's the smallest
      you got?

29:36.742 --> 29:37.875
             Yeah.

29:42.947 --> 29:46.683
          60, 80, 100.

29:46.685 --> 29:50.254
Pleasure doing business
with you.

29:55.026 --> 29:57.027
     Got your old man gum.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.195
All right.

30:02.934 --> 30:04.868
Beckett! Samuel!

30:04.870 --> 30:07.404
Where are you?
We've got mail.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.975
        Please, Dad,
        you gotta stop.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.980
But I haven't
even started.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.248
         Jesus Christ.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.584
    Waking up every morning
    with a beer

30:20.586 --> 30:22.553
        and moving on
        to the whiskey,

30:22.555 --> 30:23.687
       spending
       every last penny--

30:23.689 --> 30:26.490
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Watch it, son.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.025
Remember your place.

30:28.027 --> 30:28.792
              Son?

30:28.794 --> 30:31.094
       I'm the one
       keeping us afloat.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.629
This is my house,

30:32.631 --> 30:36.867
my chair,
my table, my books.

30:37.837 --> 30:41.004
    When was the last time
    Sammy's went to school?
    Do you even remember?

30:41.006 --> 30:42.539
What the bloody hell
does he need

30:42.541 --> 30:45.342
a public-school
education for, eh?

30:45.344 --> 30:47.544
I'm teaching him.
      Yeah.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.246
      To wear tights
      and be a circus act,

30:49.248 --> 30:51.081
     but he can't multiply,
     subtract, add.

30:51.083 --> 30:56.520
Since when do you care about
addition, you--you pikey jock?

30:57.722 --> 31:01.859
       Well, if you can't
       take care of him,

31:01.861 --> 31:03.026
            I will.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.928
Oh. Heh heh.

31:04.930 --> 31:07.965
You think
you're so strong, huh,

31:07.967 --> 31:10.033
so grown-up,

31:10.035 --> 31:12.569
but you're
just a petty thief

31:12.571 --> 31:16.974
slipping his hand into
the pockets of the world.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.011
         That's what
         you taught me.

31:31.923 --> 31:34.191
        Son of a bitch.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.559
             What?

31:35.561 --> 31:37.661
         Nothing, man.
         It's my dad.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.730
       He's in a bad way.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.865
Come on.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.437
Ah, I knew the geek
inside of you

31:47.439 --> 31:49.273
was up to something, man.

32:09.127 --> 32:10.193
I made them,

32:10.195 --> 32:12.129
all of 'em.

32:13.631 --> 32:16.667
     And you're living like
     you're hungry, man?

32:19.804 --> 32:21.772
         Wait, so that
         $100 bill--

32:21.774 --> 32:23.106
Yeah, that was a test run.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.842
         Oh, my--
         This is epic.

32:25.844 --> 32:27.277
       Where are the rest
       of the hundreds?

32:27.279 --> 32:32.549
Those are the last two,
and Donny only lets me
print fives and twenties.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.584
         That asshole
         that showed up
         at your house?

32:34.586 --> 32:35.886
         Who the fuck
         is he, really?

32:35.888 --> 32:38.188
       My mom's
       ex-cousin-in-law.

32:39.324 --> 32:39.923
              And?

32:39.925 --> 32:42.759
And I been helping Donny
since I was a kid.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.528
A few years ago,
he had me take over,

32:44.530 --> 32:45.595
and he comes in
every two weeks.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.998
I give him what I make,
and we change for cash.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.167
     Okay. What's the cut?

32:50.169 --> 32:51.268
25-75.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.170
              25?

32:53.172 --> 32:54.738
    Wait, wait, wait, wait.
    Hold--

32:54.740 --> 32:56.473
       So let me
       get this straight.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.842
      You've been working
      for him for years.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.143
        You're still
        taking the bus.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.445
        You're swimming
        in dough here,

33:01.447 --> 33:02.913
and you ain't
got shit to show for it.

33:02.915 --> 33:04.881
     The Feds have
     assholes just looking
     for people like us.

33:04.883 --> 33:06.450
     Donny survived 'cause
     he doesn't spend.

33:06.452 --> 33:09.453
What is the point of
having money if you're
not gonna spend it?

33:09.455 --> 33:11.321
    He has a guy that
    comes in every two weeks

33:11.323 --> 33:12.556
    and brings a set amount
    of paper and ink.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.192
     I have to account
     for every little thing
     that I use.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.160
     If I mess up a sheet,
     I have to save it

33:17.162 --> 33:19.930
       so Donny can
       rest easy I'm not
       stealing from him.

33:19.932 --> 33:21.565
Did Donny
give you that, too?

33:21.567 --> 33:24.301
Is that a part
of the deal?

33:25.236 --> 33:28.205
    The rules are in place
    so we don't get caught.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.373
           Bullshit.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.307
That's--They are.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.342
         The cashier
         at Maceo Mart
         used that pen

33:32.344 --> 33:35.545
       on that $100 bill,
       and it passed with
       flying colors.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.014
Of course.
It's the perfect note.

33:37.016 --> 33:41.151
        We gotta
        get this asshole
        at his own game.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.219
        Where is he now?

33:42.221 --> 33:45.455
He'll be back
in two weeks.
He lives out of town.

33:48.126 --> 33:51.261
       We can move loads
       in that time.

33:53.231 --> 33:56.199
I do have a guy
who can get us
our own paper and ink.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.101
      Then let's call him.

33:59.237 --> 34:00.971
             Okay.

34:00.973 --> 34:01.872
Yeah, yeah.

34:01.874 --> 34:05.342
To get this right, though,
we need the Heidelberg.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.210
          Okay. Okay.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.277
     What is a Heidelberg?

34:08.280 --> 34:09.612
It's the final piece.

34:09.614 --> 34:11.214
        Then let's get
        the final piece!

34:11.216 --> 34:12.049
            Come on.

34:59.098 --> 34:59.996
This is it.
This is it.

34:59.998 --> 35:03.300
     Dude, this looks like
     it belongs on a ship.

35:03.302 --> 35:06.937
Oh ho ho.
I'm gonna make flawless
hundreds with this baby.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.004
Get the lift. Go.

35:08.006 --> 35:11.108
         42,500, right?

35:11.110 --> 35:12.075
         That's my cut?

35:12.077 --> 35:13.376
Yes. Get the lift.

35:13.378 --> 35:14.845
             Yeah.

35:14.847 --> 35:16.746
Oh, God.

35:32.096 --> 35:33.330
Let's bounce.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.373
             Grace.

35:43.375 --> 35:44.374
              Hey.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.175
              Hey.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.610
          What are
          you reading?

35:46.612 --> 35:48.912
        Uh, this month's
        "Phantom Halo."

35:48.914 --> 35:53.550
He's trying to save
these two planets
from hyperwar.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.685
          Super cool.

35:57.388 --> 35:59.389
So, um, is--

35:59.391 --> 36:02.359
is Grace
your Chinese name?

36:04.862 --> 36:06.429
         We're Korean.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.170
     My father wanted this.

36:14.405 --> 36:16.573
    He said too many thieves
    is bad for business,

36:16.575 --> 36:18.975
     and business
     in this neighborhood's
     been very bad.

36:18.977 --> 36:21.144
      Samuel, what's
      going on out there?

36:21.146 --> 36:21.978
              Shh.

36:21.980 --> 36:22.746
        We're even now.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.247
         You don't have
         to worry.

36:26.617 --> 36:27.684
              Ahh!

36:27.686 --> 36:28.952
         Come in, Sam.
         Rehearse.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.787
        What's going on?
        Oh, my God.

36:30.789 --> 36:33.456
      Who did this to you?
      What--What--

36:35.126 --> 36:35.959
Three guys, they just...

36:35.961 --> 36:40.697
To you, your father
      should be as a god...

36:42.300 --> 36:45.235
       one that composed
       your beauties,

36:45.237 --> 36:46.970
  yea, and one to whom you are

36:46.972 --> 36:51.841
     but as a form in wax,
     by him imprinted...

36:52.510 --> 36:53.643
      and within his power

36:53.645 --> 36:57.747
      to leave the figure
      or disfigure it.

37:07.758 --> 37:10.160
Sammy, what's with
the duct tape?

37:10.162 --> 37:12.062
You're gonna get
an infection.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.029
      You're an infection.

37:13.031 --> 37:15.599
    You know, I been--
    sat here waiting for you

37:15.601 --> 37:17.767
    for hours, and look.
    I made, what, six bucks.

37:17.769 --> 37:20.303
    And two of those
    are mine to begin with.

37:20.305 --> 37:21.771
It's fine. I got cash.

37:21.773 --> 37:22.472
             What?

37:22.474 --> 37:24.941
        I thought
        we were a team.

37:26.344 --> 37:27.677
Listen, Sammy,

37:27.679 --> 37:30.447
I'm really sorry
I wasn't there last night.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.148
        Where'd you get
        that money?

37:32.150 --> 37:33.717
I got you...

37:34.753 --> 37:36.253
some antibiotics,
some tape.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.288
We don't need you losing
any more limbs.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.790
And look. Ha ha.
No laces to tie.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.325
       Where'd you get
       that money, Beck?

37:42.327 --> 37:45.028
Come on.
Let's get you home.
You don't look so good.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.229
           I got it.

38:07.051 --> 38:08.518
Ms. Rose.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.153
          Oh, Beckett.

38:10.155 --> 38:11.421
         You scared me.

38:11.423 --> 38:12.489
       Larry's not here.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.824
What are you doing,
Ms. Rose?

38:14.826 --> 38:17.160
      Cutting watermelon,
      Beckett.

38:17.162 --> 38:20.363
I love watermelon.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.938
       You shouldn't
       show up uninvited.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.273
Do you even
know what to do

38:30.275 --> 38:31.875
if a man comes at you
with a knife?

38:31.877 --> 38:36.846
     If you're
     gonna attack me,
     just get it over with.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.281
Attack you?

38:38.283 --> 38:41.518
Ms. Rose,
I teach this stuff.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.521
             Here.

38:46.390 --> 38:47.390
       I love this shirt.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.359
        Please don't
        get blood on it.

38:50.795 --> 38:52.696
Okay. So now
what would you do?

38:52.698 --> 38:55.065
     Well, if I had a gun,
     I'd shoot you.

38:55.067 --> 38:57.801
But you don't,
so what would you do?

38:57.803 --> 38:58.702
           Call 911?

38:58.704 --> 39:00.470
No. Grab my hand here,

39:00.472 --> 39:03.773
       here. Twist under.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.744
There you go.
Knee me in the--

39:10.281 --> 39:13.049
What would you do now?

39:16.987 --> 39:18.922
That was pathetic,
Ms. Rose,

39:18.924 --> 39:20.523
like flipping a pancake.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.259
Ohh!

39:23.261 --> 39:24.594
             Okay.

39:24.596 --> 39:27.330
Oh, my God.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.467
          Watermelon?

39:32.370 --> 39:34.537
So what about your family?

39:36.841 --> 39:39.509
Never mind. You don't
have to answer that.

39:39.511 --> 39:43.847
       It was just me,
       my little brother,
       and my dad.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.316
        My mom took off.

39:46.318 --> 39:49.219
How long ago was that?

39:49.221 --> 39:51.588
           Six years.

39:57.828 --> 39:59.863
Beckett, do you
have a girlfriend?

39:59.865 --> 40:02.866
         Heh. Heh heh.

40:05.569 --> 40:07.670
You ever been in love?

40:08.639 --> 40:09.839
           Have you?

40:11.409 --> 40:14.511
        I don't see
        a man here now.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.148
I'll tell Larry
you stopped by.

40:20.985 --> 40:23.253
        Can I come
        visit you again?

40:23.255 --> 40:25.021
Oh, Beckett,

40:25.023 --> 40:27.891
I don't think
that's a good idea.

40:39.069 --> 40:40.837
      You feel that heat?

40:42.006 --> 40:44.808
I don't feel much
these days.

40:48.379 --> 40:52.015
         If we shadows
         have offended,

40:52.017 --> 40:56.619
       think but this,
       and all is mended.

41:13.537 --> 41:15.071
      I come from dirt...

41:16.106 --> 41:19.742
      and it is dirt
      which defines us...

41:20.344 --> 41:23.513
        dirt from which
        all things grow.

41:25.049 --> 41:27.484
      Even one as mighty
      as the Phantom Halo

41:27.486 --> 41:30.687
          has the mark
     of dirt upon his skin.

41:31.121 --> 41:35.592
     But no one truly ever
     escapes their home.

41:38.229 --> 41:42.065
      And when the Phantom
   unveiled his mighty wings,

41:42.067 --> 41:45.068
       the very winds
       changed direction,

41:45.070 --> 41:51.741
and the downtrodden cried out
     to see such beauty.

41:51.743 --> 41:53.843
      And so I ask you...

41:55.346 --> 41:57.313
            and you

41:57.315 --> 41:58.414
         and you and--

41:58.416 --> 42:00.383
     and you and you and--

42:00.385 --> 42:02.485
    and you and all of you,

42:02.487 --> 42:05.488
          how much more
      will you have to bear

42:05.490 --> 42:09.626
  before you say, "I am done?"

42:16.867 --> 42:19.168
       The time is mine.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.384
      Dad would kill you.

42:34.386 --> 42:35.919
Well, look
at all this money.

42:35.921 --> 42:38.288
       Puck to Pig Latin?

42:39.189 --> 42:40.757
        You're breaking
        the rules.

42:40.759 --> 42:42.292
Oh, you're one to talk.

42:42.294 --> 42:45.562
     This money
     will never be enough.

42:46.330 --> 42:48.131
The Phantom Halo
was here today,

42:48.133 --> 42:51.000
and the winds themselves
will shift direction.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.636
       Jesus, and now
       a weather report.

42:55.439 --> 42:57.073
You never listen,
do you?

42:57.075 --> 42:59.576
You know,
you're just like Dad.

42:59.578 --> 43:01.844
     You're just like Dad,

43:01.846 --> 43:04.480
        a lost dreamer.

43:04.482 --> 43:07.550
Well, I don't
need you here, man.

43:18.462 --> 43:24.367
        My conscience
        hath a thousand
        several tongues,

43:24.369 --> 43:28.204
    and every tongue brings
    in a several tale,

43:28.206 --> 43:31.574
         and every tale
         condemns me
         for a villain.

43:31.576 --> 43:34.611
     Perjury,
     in the highest degree;

43:34.613 --> 43:36.546
    murder
    in the direst degree...

43:36.548 --> 43:37.747
       throng to the bar,

43:37.749 --> 43:40.350
     crying all, "Guilty!"

43:43.954 --> 43:45.855
           "Guilty."

43:52.563 --> 43:55.832
Oh, so he does remember
Shakespeare then.

43:55.834 --> 43:59.869
        Two stars keep
        not their motion
        in one universe.

43:59.871 --> 44:01.204
In one sphere.

44:02.740 --> 44:04.907
        We're done here.

44:18.922 --> 44:21.424
       Dude, this guy
       Donny used to work
       for Smashmouth.

44:21.426 --> 44:23.693
          We can run
          the hundreds
          through him.

44:23.695 --> 44:25.128
This better work.

44:25.896 --> 44:26.829
          Fire it up.

44:26.831 --> 44:28.531
Okay. Whoo!
I'm nervous.

44:28.533 --> 44:30.400
Here we go.

44:33.537 --> 44:35.571
              Oh!

45:11.209 --> 45:13.209
       Yeah, it's a door,
       and I love it.

45:43.608 --> 45:45.675
Ah, I love the smell
of a new car.

45:45.677 --> 45:49.846
- Don't stop.
- Don't stop.

45:58.922 --> 46:01.891
What are you doing?

46:01.893 --> 46:02.558
              Oh.

46:02.560 --> 46:05.595
       Uh, I was looking
       out the window

46:05.597 --> 46:07.730
     and noticed the grass
     was uneven.

46:07.732 --> 46:10.066
      Thought I'd come
      out here and fix it.

46:11.436 --> 46:12.735
       I'm giving myself
       blisters.

46:12.737 --> 46:15.972
Well, why don't you
go inside and relax?

46:23.313 --> 46:25.381
The weight that we carry,

46:25.383 --> 46:32.021
mud, is truly the weight
of our unfolded wings.

46:33.857 --> 46:35.558
It is our--our right--

46:35.560 --> 46:36.592
our--our journey

46:36.594 --> 46:41.297
to become more like
the Phantom Halo...

46:42.533 --> 46:46.769
marked by mud,
but not trapped by it.

48:24.902 --> 48:27.703
      So did Donny
      buy you this place?

48:27.705 --> 48:29.538
What do you know
about Donny?

48:31.241 --> 48:33.342
       Nothing. I just...

48:35.012 --> 48:38.381
Big Larry's idea of fun
was to whack me in the face,

48:38.383 --> 48:41.117
so I ran away
when Little Larry was a baby,

48:41.119 --> 48:42.418
and Donny,
Big Larry's cousin,

48:42.420 --> 48:46.389
took pity on us and
gave us this place to live.

48:47.057 --> 48:48.291
       Does he touch you?

48:48.293 --> 48:49.792
              No.

48:49.794 --> 48:51.460
End of story, Beckett.

48:53.630 --> 48:56.198
Go on. Get out of here.

48:58.669 --> 49:01.337
        Do you like me?

49:05.742 --> 49:07.343
Yes, I do.

49:59.363 --> 50:01.831
Samuel!

50:01.833 --> 50:02.498
             Yeah.

50:02.500 --> 50:06.102
       Come inside!
       It's getting late!

50:06.104 --> 50:08.004
All right.

50:08.006 --> 50:10.072
              Now.

50:10.074 --> 50:11.273
             Okay.

50:14.978 --> 50:16.612
Oh, why do you
even bother?

50:16.614 --> 50:20.716
I won--I won that piece
of junk in a poker game.

50:20.718 --> 50:23.319
It kicked on me
years ago.

50:23.321 --> 50:25.855
      Car needs oil, Dad.

50:25.857 --> 50:29.525
Well, I put oil
in that car.

50:30.460 --> 50:31.761
             Where?

50:31.763 --> 50:34.330
In--In the oil hole.

50:43.073 --> 50:46.008
         Why aren't you
         working, Dad?

50:47.010 --> 50:48.644
Oh, I did...

50:48.646 --> 50:50.513
             work.

50:50.515 --> 50:53.649
Oh, you should have
seen my Hamlet.

50:54.818 --> 50:56.185
My boy, my darling boy.

50:56.187 --> 50:57.820
Come on. Come sit.

50:57.822 --> 50:58.921
        No. I'm too big.

50:58.923 --> 50:59.789
Oh, come on.

50:59.791 --> 51:01.223
Please, please, sit.

51:01.225 --> 51:04.226
Come sit, please. Please.

51:04.228 --> 51:06.529
             Dad...

51:06.531 --> 51:08.998
Come on.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.733
Ah, here.

51:13.770 --> 51:15.337
Ohh. You know...

51:15.339 --> 51:18.641
I--I don't understand

51:18.643 --> 51:20.376
why you brought home
so little.

51:20.378 --> 51:21.677
You know
what I'm saying?

51:21.679 --> 51:24.847
I'm starting to think that
you're stealing from me.

51:24.849 --> 51:26.482
         No, Dad.
         I'm--I'm not.

51:26.484 --> 51:28.851
    The crowd wasn't
    carrying nothing today.

51:28.853 --> 51:30.252
Anything. Anything!

51:30.254 --> 51:31.053
Listen to you.

51:31.055 --> 51:33.289
Your dumb brother's
rubbing off on you.

51:33.291 --> 51:35.991
   If you ask Beckett,
   he'll say the same thing.

51:35.993 --> 51:37.426
Well, where is Beckett?

51:54.911 --> 51:58.080
        She's gorgeous,
        simply gorgeous,

51:58.082 --> 52:00.116
        but a bit
        too old for you.

52:00.118 --> 52:01.250
She's just a friend.

52:02.019 --> 52:04.620
     You've got sex written
     all over your face.

52:09.860 --> 52:12.061
       Really is amazing
       how much you learn

52:12.063 --> 52:16.132
      about anatomy
      in my line of work.

52:16.134 --> 52:17.733
              Ahh!

52:17.735 --> 52:19.568
         See, if I have
         my friend here

52:19.570 --> 52:21.804
         push his knife
         any further,

52:21.806 --> 52:24.607
       he'll sever
       your iliac artery.

52:24.609 --> 52:28.477
    Now, this artery splits
    as it descends

52:28.479 --> 52:30.446
     and then divides again
     from the aorta,

52:30.448 --> 52:33.716
      which supplies blood
      to your lower limbs.

52:33.718 --> 52:37.553
       You'll lose
       use of your legs,

52:37.555 --> 52:41.790
    your dick,
    all the important parts.

52:43.894 --> 52:45.161
        Now, I thought
        it was important

52:45.163 --> 52:49.165
      that we have a visit
      like this so I could
      light the fire.

52:49.167 --> 52:53.536
      And, you know,
      I was right, because
      I feel much better.

53:08.318 --> 53:13.489
      Samuel brought home
      $40 today.

53:13.491 --> 53:16.158
$40? That's impossible.

53:16.760 --> 53:20.229
       Are you stealing
       from me, Beckett?

53:21.364 --> 53:23.599
Are you serious?

53:24.167 --> 53:28.304
Where's my Tony Hawk
skateboard, hmm?

53:28.306 --> 53:29.505
My Star Wars collection?

53:29.507 --> 53:31.473
My gold cross and chain?

53:32.776 --> 53:35.678
     Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
     What happened to you?

53:35.680 --> 53:37.546
Oh, this?

53:38.348 --> 53:40.516
This is what
your friend does.

53:40.518 --> 53:41.617
             What?

53:41.619 --> 53:43.852
How much money
do you owe Roman?

53:43.854 --> 53:45.588
      D-Did Roman do that?

53:45.590 --> 53:48.757
        No, no! No! No!

53:49.392 --> 53:50.993
You're gonna
get us all killed.

53:50.995 --> 53:53.329
        I'm gonna
        save your life,
        son. I promise.

53:53.331 --> 53:57.233
      No one will ever
      touch you like that
      again, ever.

54:01.571 --> 54:04.406
You're delusional,

54:04.408 --> 54:06.809
and if you
don't stop drinking,

54:06.811 --> 54:08.844
you're gonna die alone.

54:18.188 --> 54:21.523
Why don't you
make that last?

54:21.525 --> 54:24.093
I gotta go lay down.

54:24.095 --> 54:26.095
    Hey--Hey, Beckett, wait.

54:26.097 --> 54:26.662
             Wait.

54:26.664 --> 54:29.231
       Do you want
       some mor--Do you--

54:29.233 --> 54:31.033
          I love you.

54:34.437 --> 54:39.642
Tomorrow, and tomorrow,

54:39.644 --> 54:41.644
        and tomorrow...

54:41.646 --> 54:46.115
    creeps in this petty pace
         from day to day

54:46.117 --> 54:49.351
      to the last syllable
      of recorded time...

54:50.587 --> 54:52.221
     and all our yesterdays

54:52.223 --> 54:56.792
    have lighted fools
    the way to dusty death.

54:57.927 --> 55:04.300
    Out, out, brief candle.

55:04.834 --> 55:06.268
  Life's but a walking shadow,

55:06.270 --> 55:12.007
a poor player that struts and
frets his hour upon the stage

55:12.009 --> 55:14.643
     and is heard no more.

55:16.012 --> 55:21.850
        It is a tale
        told by an idiot

55:21.852 --> 55:25.554
   full of sound and fury...

55:25.556 --> 55:28.557
      signifying nothing.

55:35.632 --> 55:37.299
          Who's there?

55:37.301 --> 55:40.302
It's Little Larry.

55:41.671 --> 55:43.472
          Remember me?

55:44.541 --> 55:47.609
               No.
        Beckett's friend.

55:48.345 --> 55:49.311
What's with the bag?

55:49.313 --> 55:54.383
     Oh, uh, Beckett and I
     are starting a new
     workout regime, so...

55:54.385 --> 55:55.451
Beckett!

55:55.453 --> 55:57.553
         I'm out here.

55:58.054 --> 56:00.622
      About to take
      your dad to the gym
      instead of you.

56:00.624 --> 56:02.558
Not--Not today.

56:02.560 --> 56:03.158
             Yeah?

56:03.160 --> 56:05.728
      I'll run circles
      around your fat ass.

56:05.730 --> 56:06.829
      I wouldn't be
      too sure about that.

56:06.831 --> 56:10.366
      Sir, do you mind if
      I use the restroom
      before we head out?

56:10.368 --> 56:11.200
No, no, not at all.

56:11.202 --> 56:13.802
Go to the end of the hall,
to the left.

56:13.804 --> 56:15.070
Great.
 Hmm.

56:24.514 --> 56:26.582
Where do you
know him from?

56:26.584 --> 56:28.984
  It was a boy home.
Oh, that criminal camp?

56:28.986 --> 56:30.185
I don't want him here.
You know,

56:30.187 --> 56:31.854
he's probably
stealing soap as we speak.

56:31.856 --> 56:33.155
         We don't have
         any soap, Dad.

56:33.157 --> 56:34.790
Well, then get--get some.

56:39.662 --> 56:41.730
You remember when Mom
used to freak out

56:41.732 --> 56:44.933
and scramble for quarters
when that thing came around?

56:45.870 --> 56:47.669
      Don't go reminiscing
      about the past.

56:47.671 --> 56:49.138
        It wasn't
        any better then.

56:49.140 --> 56:51.140
 Yes, it was.
No, it wasn't.

57:14.731 --> 57:16.632
Sorry about the soap.

57:18.134 --> 57:21.103
You didn't wash
your filthy hands, did you?

57:21.105 --> 57:22.471
    Oh, I just took a piss.

57:22.473 --> 57:25.240
But you had your hands
on your pecker.

57:25.242 --> 57:26.275
       I don't touch it.

57:26.277 --> 57:29.511
Ah, that's a trick
I don't know.

57:29.513 --> 57:30.546
           Should we?

57:30.548 --> 57:31.413
        Yeah, let's go.

57:31.415 --> 57:33.982
     Lovely home, honestly.

57:33.984 --> 57:35.551
             Okay.

57:39.122 --> 57:40.422
What's with the bag?

57:40.424 --> 57:41.323
       Gym clothes, man.

57:41.325 --> 57:43.058
       I was serious
       about working out.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.393
          Helps with
          the chicks.

57:44.395 --> 57:45.127
Heh heh.

57:45.129 --> 57:46.495
Little Larry?

57:46.497 --> 57:47.963
Hey.

57:47.965 --> 57:48.797
             Damn.

57:48.799 --> 57:50.632
     Is this yours?
     Where'd you get this?

57:50.634 --> 57:53.068
       We bought it.
       It's pretty sweet,
       right?

57:53.070 --> 57:54.169
              We?

57:55.638 --> 57:57.105
           With what?

57:57.107 --> 57:58.907
        Have you two
        lost your heads?

57:58.909 --> 58:00.509
       This is what
       you've been up to?

58:00.511 --> 58:01.910
        We don't even
        have groceries,

58:01.912 --> 58:03.712
      and you--you bought
      a fucking Bentley?

58:03.714 --> 58:05.247
        I'm handling it.

58:05.249 --> 58:07.516
       I'm hungry, Beck.

58:10.454 --> 58:12.087
          Get yourself
          some food.

58:14.524 --> 58:15.958
Don't treat me like a kid.

58:15.960 --> 58:18.227
          Stop acting
          like a kid.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.230
        Good to see you,
        Samuel.

58:30.540 --> 58:31.340
         Look out. Ohh!

58:31.342 --> 58:33.575
Give me another one.
Got a lot.

58:34.077 --> 58:35.844
        Oh, thank you
        for the present.

58:38.047 --> 58:39.381
          Let me do
          the talking,
          all right?

58:39.383 --> 58:40.816
     Just as long
     as I get my 42 grand.

58:40.818 --> 58:43.952
      Oh, we'll come back
      with a lot more
      than that, man.

59:28.299 --> 59:29.831
          Smashmouth.

59:31.801 --> 59:32.834
        You gotta be...

59:32.836 --> 59:33.902
          Smashmouth.

59:33.904 --> 59:35.270
        What you got...

59:35.272 --> 59:37.439
Smashmouth.

59:37.441 --> 59:39.975
       Full house, baby.

59:40.978 --> 59:43.211
       Check it out. Huh?

59:44.147 --> 59:45.247
              Ow!

59:47.317 --> 59:48.784
Let go of me.

59:48.786 --> 59:51.920
       Let go of me, man.

59:52.488 --> 59:53.989
God damn it.

59:53.991 --> 59:55.891
          Get off me.

59:55.893 --> 59:57.759
          God damn it.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.331
I have new pajamas
made every month.

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:06.568
     Don't they, uh,
     sell 'em at the store?

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.469
These are Italian silk.

01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:09.538
       You know, I had
       a silk shirt once.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.406
      It felt really good
      on my skin,

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:14.576
         smooth, silky,
         if you will.

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:22.017
Is that retard Donny
still teaching you
everything that you know?

01:00:22.019 --> 01:00:24.586
Jesus Christ,
you haven't done or said

01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:27.089
one intelligent thing
yet today.

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:35.230
       Look, I'm done
       with Donny, okay?

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:38.000
    I did this from my lab,

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:39.735
      and it is flawless.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:42.838
         Take a gander.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.473
Donny know you're here?

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:47.009
       No, of course not.

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:47.776
             Good.

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:50.078
Best that way.
    Yeah.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.415
I wouldn't want him
to get his panties wet.

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:55.817
He's a jealous man.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:56.585
          That he is.

01:00:56.587 --> 01:00:59.755
Now, I understand
you arrived in a Bentley.

01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:02.524
    Yeah.
    Continental Supersport.

01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:04.493
You pay cash for that?

01:01:04.495 --> 01:01:05.394
        Yeah. What else?

01:01:05.396 --> 01:01:08.330
You're not only being
taught by a retard.

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:09.598
You are a retard.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.836
And if you ever come
around here waving cash
like a lunatic again,

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.739
I'm gonna rip
your face off.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:19.941
You got that?

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:24.212
I'll see if this passes,
and then we'll be in touch.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.315
       Oh, ye--uh,
       I thought we were

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:29.384
       gonna do
       the--the exchange?

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:30.585
Well, you thought wrong.

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:33.989
        I see it.
        You--You don't--

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:36.992
            Beckett?

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:39.928
       They took
       the briefcase
       out of the trunk.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:40.896
         There's
         nothing left.

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:42.964
        We need to get
        out of here now.

01:01:42.966 --> 01:01:44.266
           Let's go.

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:50.172
       For your trouble.

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:57.412
Do you think this is
gonna cover it?

01:01:57.414 --> 01:02:01.516
I did all of this
because I assumed
a payday was in order.

01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:04.086
My pops always told me
never to assume anything,

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:06.288
and now I'm just
an ass with a fat lip

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.356
who's three steps closer
to his fucking grave!

01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:10.292
      We just need to wait
      for Smashmouth.

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:11.560
Smashmouth
is a psychopath.

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:13.628
We ain't getting
our money back!

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:16.364
Open your fucking eyes,
man!

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.844
           Holy shit.

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:30.612
       High school girls,
       man.

01:02:30.614 --> 01:02:32.748
        Oh, my God.
        Yeah, bend over.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.850
Are you serious?

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:39.888
Your dick is
blinding you, man.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:42.791
     It's just having fun.

01:02:42.793 --> 01:02:44.192
This isn't fun.

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:01.910
              Hey.

01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:03.245
        How old are you?

01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:05.981
            18. Why?

01:03:05.983 --> 01:03:08.383
Give me
the fucking money.

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:10.752
You're acting
like a juvenile.

01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:12.521
             Jesus.

01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:14.556
You know,
Samuel was right.

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:16.858
We're stuck in the mud.

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.528
God, I'm better
than this shit.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.696
        No, you're not.

01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:24.466
       We are who we are,
       Beckett.

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:26.535
       We are who we are.

01:03:26.537 --> 01:03:27.469
Well, I'm outta here.

01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:30.438
    Can't go anywhere, dude.
    I have the car.

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:38.847
Get outta here.
Get outta here.

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:40.782
Get outta here!

01:03:40.784 --> 01:03:42.951
Get the fuck
outta here!

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:53.028
       It's okay, Samuel.

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:55.197
Oh, it's--it's super late.

01:03:55.199 --> 01:03:56.832
      I know. I snuck out.

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.200
        I have something
        for you.

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:00.101
Well, you had something
for me last time, too.

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:02.704
    I found this in
    my grandfather's stuff.

01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:04.339
       I'm sorry.
       It's kind of old,

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:07.576
       but I think
       you might like it.

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:10.812
             1961?

01:04:10.814 --> 01:04:12.480
This is
his first appearance.

01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:14.115
This is his origin.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:16.852
You know, just like
Shakespeare's Prince Hal,

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:18.653
everyone underestimated
the Phantom Halo.

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:19.387
          Prince Hal?

01:04:19.389 --> 01:04:22.357
Yeah. He ran with
this group of thieves

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:23.725
in the underbelly
of London,

01:04:23.727 --> 01:04:26.661
and then he threw away
his old clothes

01:04:26.663 --> 01:04:28.263
and became King Henry V

01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:30.732
and then successfully
conquered France.

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:32.367
I--I can't--
I can't take this.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.002
This is worth,
like, $100,000.

01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:37.205
        What's going on
        in there?

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:38.173
Beckett!

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:39.841
That's my pop.
   Samuel!

01:04:39.843 --> 01:04:41.042
He's drunk.

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:03.265
Beckett. It's so late.

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:09.771
      I don't even know
      what I'm doing here.

01:05:09.773 --> 01:05:12.574
What happened
to your face?

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.177
Don't worry.
Little Larry's fine.

01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:18.880
      I wasn't asking
      about Little Larry.

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:22.183
I gotta get
out of here, Rose.

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.854
My whole family,
we gotta go.

01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:27.956
       What do you mean?

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.067
When I was a kid,

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:43.638
my mom used to take off
her wedding rings
to do the dishes.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:49.544
She had this weird idea
that the dish soap would
wear away the gold.

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:53.682
She loved those rings,

01:05:53.684 --> 01:05:57.519
said they were
the prettiest things
she'd ever owned.

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:01.289
When I was 13...

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:05.660
my dad lost his paychecks
at the track.

01:06:07.763 --> 01:06:09.698
He knew she'd kill him,

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:13.068
so he told me
to steal those rings.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:19.274
So--But instead, I went
to my friend's house.

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:23.178
I took their TV
and all their jewelry.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.379
              Heh.

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:28.583
But I was untrained.
I got caught.

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:32.253
         And that was
         the bad stuff?

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:39.527
I did what I was told,
and I took the rings.

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:42.731
The day before
I got out of juvie,

01:06:42.733 --> 01:06:45.600
my mom found 'em
in my room.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:49.537
When she asked me
why I took 'em...

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.477
all I could think about
was protecting my father.

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:01.216
So I looked her
in the eye...

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.221
and I said,

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:09.557
"Because it
was an easy take."

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:16.598
Nothing was ever
the same between us,
and then she left.

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:19.868
     And you think she left
     because of you.

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.636
Wouldn't you?

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:23.405
         You can think
         what you want,

01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:28.043
         but she left
         two young boys
         with a drunk.

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:35.216
I have something for you.

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:43.158
         You took that?

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:52.434
You--You make me
want to be honest.

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.885
         Not necessary.

01:08:10.887 --> 01:08:13.288
          We are even.

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.800
I'm coming back
tonight to get you.

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:29.604
        I won't be here.

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:51.392
      I'm not gonna
      say goodbye to you.

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:10.245
     Carlene, Carlene,
     I need the money now.

01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:13.413
You said under
no circumstances to give you
that money before closing.

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:16.751
       I'll give you
       $1,000 if you
       give it to me now.

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:18.685
No. I'll see you
at closing.

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:20.854
      No, no, no.
      Things have changed.

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:23.158
         Now means now.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.026
So you'll
give me $1,000

01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:27.428
and promise you
won't get me fired.

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.596
     A thousand times, yes.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.167
         This is
         the employees'
         bathroom.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.502
           Come out!
           Come out!

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:36.904
          We're good.

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:37.705
You're naughty.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:40.441
Oh, I am.

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:41.876
    Where'd you get
    all this money, anyway?

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:46.214
          Oh, I am
          a part-time
          stripper.

01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:47.482
         Whoo! Heh heh.

01:09:48.283 --> 01:09:49.817
         You're funny.

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:52.620
         Still sealed.

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:54.221
           Good girl.

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:55.990
             Here.

01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:59.460
See, that's...

01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:01.296
             Here.

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:09.837
             Ha ha!

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:12.867
            Samuel.
            Samuel.

01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:13.868
              What?
           Let me in.

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:15.637
      I--I left something
      in your closet.

01:11:15.639 --> 01:11:16.804
      What were you doing
      in my room?

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:20.141
      Beckett told me I
      could hide something
      in your closet.

01:11:20.143 --> 01:11:20.975
       No, you're lying.

01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:24.312
  Beckett knows there's
  nothing safe in this house.

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:26.247
       Jesus, come on in.

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.786
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
W-What are you doing?

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:32.954
            No. No!

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:34.322
       Come on! No! Fuck!

01:11:34.324 --> 01:11:35.657
What the hell
are you doing?

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:37.191
     Where is it,
     you little shit, huh?

01:11:37.193 --> 01:11:39.160
What? Get off me!
Where is it, huh?

01:11:39.162 --> 01:11:40.094
           Come here.

01:11:40.096 --> 01:11:42.130
        You little fuck.

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:43.264
       Where's my money?!

01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:44.098
What are you doing?

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.300
      Where's my
      fucking money, huh?

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:47.035
You left money
in this house?

01:11:47.037 --> 01:11:48.269
         Unbelievable.

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:50.738
No, it was...

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:53.875
             Donny.

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:58.513
You know I hate
coming here, right, Rosie?

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:02.016
      I gave
      that boy everything.

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:03.351
        And he
        appreciates it.

01:12:03.353 --> 01:12:04.619
       We appreciate it.

01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:06.587
Did you know I waited
two hours today?

01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:12.093
And now I got this bag
of lunch here for you
to give to Little Larry,

01:12:12.095 --> 01:12:14.829
but I'm guessing
he is not here.

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:17.699
         No, he's not.

01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:19.033
              Huh.

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:22.804
Rumor has it he's
been driving a Bentley.

01:12:22.806 --> 01:12:25.206
       Bentley, as in
       like Rolls-Royce?

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:26.507
             Yeah.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.443
         Jesus, Donny.

01:12:28.445 --> 01:12:31.946
Hey, he's been seen.

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:35.316
    Let me get you a drink.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.119
             Shit!

01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:39.854
       He's out spending
       counterfeit money

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.723
    all over town right now.
    We are so screwed.

01:12:41.725 --> 01:12:43.391
What, counterfeit?
  What were you
  thinking about

01:12:43.393 --> 01:12:44.726
       putting the money
       in this house?

01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:46.994
   He couldn't possibly
   have spent all the money.

01:12:46.996 --> 01:12:48.396
         How much? What?
              150K.

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:49.564
He's in the gutter
right now

01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:50.498
throwing
all of that up.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.833
        Are you guys
        messing with me?

01:12:51.835 --> 01:12:53.234
My dad?
He's probably having

01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:54.635
the time of his life
right now.

01:12:54.637 --> 01:12:56.137
    You're a fucking idiot.

01:12:56.139 --> 01:12:57.138
You know,
I never understood

01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.173
what Beckett
ever liked about you.

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:01.042
We're brothers.
 You're not--

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:02.110
Beckett and I
are brothers,

01:13:02.112 --> 01:13:04.045
and you're just
some asshole from the past

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:04.979
that thinks
it's a good idea

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:07.014
to hide money
in the house of a thief.

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:08.316
        You and Beckett
        are the thieves!

01:13:08.318 --> 01:13:10.418
Well, what the hell
does that make you?

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.720
      I'm an entrepreneur!

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:19.560
Oh, my God.

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:25.500
      You smell like her.

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:27.268
        Okay, chill out.
        Chill out.

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.269
      You son of a bitch.

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:30.671
      You are never
      gonna see her again.

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:32.407
Back off!

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.945
             Damn!

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:39.213
       Where'd you learn
       to do that?

01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:41.482
    Phantom Halo did it once
    to the Stinger.

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:43.885
       I've always wanted
       to try it out.

01:13:43.887 --> 01:13:45.420
             Whew.

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:48.923
    He changed the key code

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:51.225
         on the door
         at work, Rose.

01:13:51.227 --> 01:13:52.193
I've never been there.

01:13:52.195 --> 01:13:55.797
How the hell am I supposed
to know what he's up to?

01:13:56.565 --> 01:14:00.368
    I need some distraction.

01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:03.438
    'Cause I'm an angry man,
    Rosie,

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.841
      and I'm trying
      not to hurt anybody.

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:07.575
Get out.

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:08.743
     You need to take care

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:11.345
    of the hand that
    fucking feeds you first.

01:14:13.383 --> 01:14:15.049
           Play nice.

01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:16.851
     You make me so horny.

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:19.387
        Fine. Fucking
        play dirty then.

01:14:19.389 --> 01:14:22.657
     Might be more
     fucking fun that way.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.141
         Fucking fight.

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.643
You've got the knife.

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:46.614
       You know,
       it's over for him.

01:14:46.616 --> 01:14:49.350
         It's over
         for your boy.

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:19.514
         Father's home.

01:15:19.516 --> 01:15:23.384
        Prepare his bed.

01:15:23.386 --> 01:15:24.151
             Whoo!

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:25.553
       Where's the money,
       Dad?

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:29.991
Boys, I had
quite a night tonight.

01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:32.159
           $150,000?

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:33.528
I had quite a night!

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.763
  Quite a night.
Where's the money?

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:38.232
It's gone. It's gone.

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:40.434
        Of course it is.

01:15:40.436 --> 01:15:42.103
         I'm gonna have
         to kill Roman.

01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:43.437
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:46.173
We are not murderers
in this house.

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:49.043
This is what separates us
from the beasts.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.679
    You don't understand.
    Little Larry trusted me.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:53.381
         We had a plan.
             Trust?

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:54.849
  Who would trust us? A plan?

01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:56.183
      I mean, look at us.
      We're pathetic.

01:15:56.185 --> 01:15:58.753
    And you, you are weak,
    and you hurt everyone--

01:15:58.755 --> 01:16:00.621
What?!

01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:01.455
Hey, no, no, no.

01:16:01.457 --> 01:16:04.392
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:06.794
I saved a bit for Roman.

01:16:06.796 --> 01:16:07.828
Look. Look.

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:08.796
Look, huh?

01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:10.464
       This isn't enough.

01:16:10.466 --> 01:16:13.334
No, no, no. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:14.602
One more. Huh?

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:16.804
I have
another one somewhere.

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:17.738
Wait, wait, wait.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.041
What the hell is that?

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:21.776
         It's Samuel's.

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:26.814
How many times did
I tell you not to bring
this shit in this house?!

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:28.149
         Give me that.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.552
Whoa, whoa, Beck.
Just--

01:16:31.554 --> 01:16:33.955
No. No.
Just calm down, Beck.

01:16:33.957 --> 01:16:35.957
       He can have
       whatever he wants.

01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:38.225
        Samuel,
        get your things.
        We're leaving.

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:40.294
     No, Beck,
     just put the gun down.

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:41.862
      You see what you do?

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:51.572
        You let me down
        every single
        fucking time.

01:16:51.574 --> 01:16:54.675
I was king last night.

01:16:59.015 --> 01:17:00.948
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.650
      Go get your things!
      We're leaving now!

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:05.252
You're not going
anywhere!

01:17:05.254 --> 01:17:07.254
Anywhere!

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:22.370
         What the hell?

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:33.381
       Hey, get--Just get
       away from this!

01:17:33.383 --> 01:17:35.950
         This is mine!
         You stole it!

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:49.130
You had something
you want to show me.

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:53.734
        It was perfect,
        wasn't it?

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:58.005
     Who the hell is this?
     Are you okay, Beckett?

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.107
           Fuck off.

01:18:01.543 --> 01:18:03.177
So I'm here.

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.047
What do you got?

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:08.082
      Me and Beckett here
      will take you to--

01:18:08.084 --> 01:18:09.583
       I'm not going
       anywhere with you.

01:18:09.585 --> 01:18:11.218
        I'm not gonna go
        by my--

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:18.459
What made you think
you could get away with
betraying Donny, hmm?

01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:21.796
    I made the perfect note.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.099
Where's the lab?

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:27.168
The lab!

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:30.638
      Even if I took
      you there, you could
      never do what I do.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.407
       It takes years,
       you ignorant fuck.

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:36.343
         Good morning,
         Vietnam.

01:18:36.345 --> 01:18:38.813
Who's this idiot?
    Oh, fuck.

01:18:38.815 --> 01:18:41.716
      I'm the only one
      who's gonna be
      killing around here.

01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:43.084
Oh, yeah?

01:18:43.086 --> 01:18:45.853
Bang!

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:48.622
          Bang? Bang?

01:18:48.624 --> 01:18:50.124
          Who the fuck
          is this?

01:18:50.126 --> 01:18:52.226
       This piece of shit
       stole my money.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:53.561
Th-That's a lie.

01:18:53.563 --> 01:18:55.596
        That's my money,
        all of it.

01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:56.997
        Well, this piece
        of shit is mine.

01:18:56.999 --> 01:18:58.499
No, Roman, look, look.

01:18:58.501 --> 01:19:01.001
I have your money
right here, huh?

01:19:01.003 --> 01:19:02.903
      What are you talk--
      That's counterfeit
      money.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:04.605
          What's that?
        Yeah. I made it.

01:19:04.607 --> 01:19:06.273
       Is that what this
       is all about?

01:19:06.275 --> 01:19:09.210
You need to turn around
and exit right now.

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:10.478
         I can make you
         money, Roman.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.445
      You can't make shit.

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:12.680
       Shut up,
       you little pussy.

01:19:12.682 --> 01:19:14.515
Put the gun down.

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:16.183
         You telling me
         what to do?

01:19:16.185 --> 01:19:17.752
Boys, boys,
boys, boys, boys.

01:19:17.754 --> 01:19:19.320
C-Come on. Come on.

01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:22.189
Let's put the guns down
and work this out.

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:25.726
Clearly there's plenty
of money to go around.

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:26.927
        Big man.
        Big fucking man.

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:29.396
       You think
       you've got it all
       figured out.

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:31.799
         Get your kids
         to parrot cash
         for you.

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:34.235
       All right, don't.
       He's just a drunk.
       He doesn't--

01:19:34.237 --> 01:19:35.536
        He doesn't know
        what he's doing.

01:19:35.538 --> 01:19:38.205
      And what is it you
      think you're doing?

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.774
This comic book,

01:19:39.776 --> 01:19:41.542
all right,
it's his first appearance

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:43.277
from the Silver Age,
the 1960s.

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:46.013
         Phantom Halo.

01:19:46.015 --> 01:19:47.314
         What the hell
         is this?

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:50.251
  It's being auctioned online
  for, like, $100,000.

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:55.089
        You don't know
        who the Halo is?

01:19:55.091 --> 01:19:57.892
     It's like not knowing
     who Spider-Man is.

01:19:59.262 --> 01:20:01.996
     Probably 'cause
     he's a lousy jigaboo.

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:09.737
Oh, God.

01:20:09.739 --> 01:20:12.673
        It's not cool
        to be a racist.

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.542
      Your Shakespearean
      slave, where is he?

01:20:14.544 --> 01:20:16.811
         I don't know.
         I don't know.
         He--He left.

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:20.915
      H-He was pissed
      'cause I don't take
      any of his bullshit.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:22.249
     Have you got my money?

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:25.486
      He doesn't have it.
      Now leave him alone!

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:31.091
      Can you pay
      your father's debts?

01:20:31.093 --> 01:20:33.160
You just did!

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:36.730
            Samuel!

01:20:36.732 --> 01:20:38.132
          Shakespeare!

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.007
          Shakespeare!

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:50.044
            Samuel.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.551
            Samuel.

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:13.200
            Samuel.

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:29.083
            Samuel.

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:02.149
          Hey, Roman.

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:11.358
           Oh, shit.

01:22:14.829 --> 01:22:15.896
Oh, my...

01:22:15.898 --> 01:22:17.498
Dad! Dad!

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.366
              Dad!

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:23.304
            Oh, my--

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:24.438
             Beck.

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.440
              Hey.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:29.109
          Beck! Beck!

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:31.145
       Wake up, Beckett!

01:22:31.147 --> 01:22:32.346
       Beckett! Come on!

01:22:32.348 --> 01:22:33.247
            Beckett!

01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:35.249
Beckett!

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:37.351
       Beckett, wake up!

01:22:37.353 --> 01:22:39.153
       Wake up, Beckett!

01:22:39.155 --> 01:22:40.988
       Ohh. Oh, God. Ohh.

01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:42.856
           You okay?

01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:43.891
Oh, that hurts.

01:22:43.893 --> 01:22:45.359
         Come on.
         Are you okay?

01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:47.695
 You okay? Come on.
Where--Where's Roman?

01:22:47.697 --> 01:22:50.030
         I'm so sorry.

01:22:50.032 --> 01:22:51.999
Where's Dad?

01:22:52.001 --> 01:22:53.500
        Oh, God, he's...

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:54.802
              No.

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:14.855
             Okay.

01:23:14.857 --> 01:23:16.623
      All right, come on.

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:20.461
            Come on.
            Come on.

01:23:22.031 --> 01:23:23.430
       You gotta come on.

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:25.299
           Let's go.

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:36.010
         You fixed it.

01:23:36.012 --> 01:23:37.411
         Yeah. Come on.

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:50.257
Now wait here.

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:14.815
"My darling Larry,

01:24:14.817 --> 01:24:18.919
       "Do not go back
       to the house ever.

01:24:18.921 --> 01:24:20.788
    "I'll get in touch soon.

01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:22.389
         "Don't worry.

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:26.393
    "And please tell Beckett
        he saved my life.

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:29.163
     He should know that."

01:25:04.566 --> 01:25:07.568
What did you do
with this car?

01:25:11.706 --> 01:25:15.175
Wait. So is this why
money's gone missing?

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:21.915
       We're disappearing

01:25:21.917 --> 01:25:24.184
       to another place.

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:40.734
Full fathom five
        thy father lies:

01:25:40.736 --> 01:25:44.571
        Of his bones
        are coral made.

01:25:44.573 --> 01:25:48.642
      Those are pearls
      that were his eyes:

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:50.711
        Nothing of him
        that doth fade,

01:25:50.713 --> 01:25:52.613
        but doth suffer
        a sea-change

01:25:52.615 --> 01:25:55.682
       into something rich
          and strange.

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:59.052
       Sea-nymphs hourly
       ring his knell:

01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:03.590
       Ding-dong, hark!
       now I hear them--

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:06.460
        ding-dong, bell.
