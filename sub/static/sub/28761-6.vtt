11:12.338 --> 11:13.756
Good afternoon.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.300
Nice to meet you.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.678
My name is Aaron.

11:19.845 --> 11:20.971
Hello, sir.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.600
I brought you something.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.853
It's from the office of the President.

11:28.020 --> 11:28.938
What is it?

11:29.188 --> 11:30.356
Open it and see.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.860
Can you put it on me please?

11:42.243 --> 11:44.370
Which puppy are we going to put it on?

11:51.377 --> 11:53.379
We're going to put it up here.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.635
It looks good on you, Mateo.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.387
Very good.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.942
He's a lovely boy.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.152
Thank you.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.611
And thank you for coming.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.071
Yes, thank you, but...

12:19.238 --> 12:20.990
If he doesn't receive a transplant...

12:21.407 --> 12:22.491
And we're deported...

12:23.492 --> 12:25.744
He will die.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.998
They told us that he wouldn't live
more than a few days...

12:29.081 --> 12:30.458
without dialysis.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.542
I understand.

12:31.625 --> 12:35.629
The doctor told us that Ruben
is a match for Mateo...

12:35.713 --> 12:37.131
He's a match?

12:37.298 --> 12:38.966
One moment please.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.546
Who's your favorite Avenger?
