23:18.732 --> 23:20.901
Yeah, Huey?

23:20.984 --> 23:24.237
You got them taking a nap, Floyd?

23:24.321 --> 23:25.739
Get back to work!

23:25.822 --> 23:27.783
Huey, don't get excited.

23:27.866 --> 23:29.576
Take it easy, now.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.620
Floyd, shut up, man.

24:02.651 --> 24:05.612
Peanuts just went up to six bits.

24:05.695 --> 24:08.907
They want you up at the bars, Bullen.

24:09.032 --> 24:12.911
Who wants the last
peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

24:13.036 --> 24:15.664
Half a rock. Who wants it?

24:30.053 --> 24:31.972
You got yourself a phone call.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.974
Aw, fuck!

24:34.057 --> 24:36.476
Look here, Eddie.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.979
Eddie, why a phone call?

24:39.062 --> 24:40.730
Let's go, Bullen.

24:40.814 --> 24:43.483
Why a fucking phone call?

24:43.567 --> 24:45.485
Hey.

24:45.569 --> 24:49.030
What's with the phone call?

24:59.833 --> 25:02.169
I'm getting ready to say
something important now.

25:02.252 --> 25:05.881
I want to know
I'm being listened to.

25:06.089 --> 25:08.884
I'm getting ready to
give out the detail.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.760
Leonard, the kitchen.

25:10.927 --> 25:13.430
Collins, slaughterhouse.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.056
Sanitation detail.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.017
You, too, Bullen.

25:18.226 --> 25:20.187
This man is hurting...

25:20.270 --> 25:22.230
You just deal with colored.

25:22.314 --> 25:24.274
I'll handle the white folks.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.777
Besides, I don't think
Bullen's got much more

25:27.861 --> 25:30.947
than refried shit
for brains this morning.

25:31.031 --> 25:34.868
What about your boy, Boyd,
for clerical?

25:56.473 --> 26:00.101
Come on, come on.
We ain't got all day.

26:29.381 --> 26:30.840
(COUGHING)

26:54.364 --> 26:55.615
Hey!

26:57.033 --> 26:59.369
I got this honky here!

27:03.248 --> 27:05.125
I'll rip this cat's head off!

27:05.208 --> 27:08.795
You get me the man! Now!

27:09.004 --> 27:11.298
I can hear his neck snapping.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.552
I want some respect!

27:17.095 --> 27:20.807
You hear me?
I want some respect!

27:20.890 --> 27:22.976
We hear you, Walter.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.978
Get me the man!

27:25.061 --> 27:27.522
I hear his neck snapping.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.065
Open this.

27:29.733 --> 27:30.817
You want in?

27:30.900 --> 27:32.193
Yeah.

27:32.277 --> 27:34.738
Some fucking respect around here.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.992
(SINGING) R-E-S-P-E-C-T

27:40.493 --> 27:43.496
<i>Find out what it means to me</i>

27:44.581 --> 27:46.583
<i>What you want</i>

27:46.708 --> 27:47.917
<i>A little respect</i>

27:48.043 --> 27:49.961
<i>What you need</i>

27:50.045 --> 27:51.838
<i>A little respect</i>

27:51.921 --> 27:53.298
<i>All I'm asking</i>

27:53.423 --> 27:56.009
<i>For a little respect
when you come home</i>

27:56.092 --> 27:59.054
<i>Baby, when you
come home</i>

27:59.137 --> 28:01.056
Hey!

28:04.809 --> 28:06.186
Can we talk?

28:06.269 --> 28:07.771
Who the fuck are you?

28:07.854 --> 28:09.356
I want the man!

28:09.439 --> 28:11.399
I am the man.

28:11.483 --> 28:14.277
I'm the new warden here.
My name is Henry Brubaker.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.289
Don't be fucking with my head.

28:26.373 --> 28:28.124
New warden, my ass!

28:28.208 --> 28:29.250
It's true.

28:29.334 --> 28:31.002
You look like a scumbag.

28:31.086 --> 28:33.213
I'm fooling those guys out there.

28:33.296 --> 28:34.297
Ha ha ha!

28:48.895 --> 28:49.896
Ha ha ha!

28:52.315 --> 28:54.150
Ha ha ha!

28:56.611 --> 28:58.363
Ha ha ha!

29:00.990 --> 29:02.659
When are you going
to paint this place?

29:02.742 --> 29:03.743
What color?

29:07.872 --> 29:10.375
Yellow, yellow.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.918
Yellow.

29:12.001 --> 29:14.629
I want a picture window
in my place.

29:15.839 --> 29:18.174
This yours? This one?

29:18.258 --> 29:23.596
And one of them
high-low pinto shag rugs

29:24.514 --> 29:26.808
and some liquor and a TV

29:26.891 --> 29:29.602
like them fucking
trusties all got.

29:32.522 --> 29:34.524
And some fresh air.

29:38.319 --> 29:39.404
Which wall?

29:41.364 --> 29:43.116
Which wall, what?

29:43.199 --> 29:45.118
The window.
The picture window.

29:45.201 --> 29:47.704
Come on.
Show me exactly.

30:08.892 --> 30:11.311
Maybe I want a skylight.

30:11.394 --> 30:13.313
Yeah, I want...

30:13.396 --> 30:15.440
I want a skylight.

30:16.608 --> 30:18.860
Aah! Aah!

30:19.861 --> 30:21.613
How you doing?

30:21.738 --> 30:24.782
Open this. Open it up!

30:24.908 --> 30:27.827
Get this man
some medical attention.

30:27.911 --> 30:30.163
Get this place painted.

30:30.246 --> 30:31.498
What color?

30:31.581 --> 30:34.375
Any fucking color he wants.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.836
Everybody crazy around here.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.671
My office.

30:42.342 --> 30:44.844
Mess with me now,
you'll regret it later.

30:44.928 --> 30:46.804
We don't work this thing out

30:46.888 --> 30:48.723
you won't be around later.

30:48.890 --> 30:52.435
I can make
that tower guard blow you out.

30:52.644 --> 30:54.646
Or you can continue
walking with me

30:54.729 --> 30:56.606
like the smart escort
I figure you to be.

31:15.124 --> 31:16.334
Hey!

31:16.459 --> 31:18.044
Hold it!

31:18.127 --> 31:19.671
I'm replacing you.

31:19.754 --> 31:21.714
Coombes, give me a hand.

31:21.798 --> 31:23.550
Call the governor.

31:23.675 --> 31:25.343
Who is this asshole?

31:25.468 --> 31:26.761
I don't know.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.179
The name's Brubaker.

31:28.263 --> 31:30.682
He thinks he's the new warden.

31:30.765 --> 31:31.891
That's the way it is.

31:32.267 --> 31:34.852
What is? What is, hmm?

31:36.854 --> 31:38.648
You're Willets, Earl?

31:38.731 --> 31:39.732
Burl.

31:39.816 --> 31:41.192
Burl, right.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.653
State employee, purchasing agent.

31:43.778 --> 31:45.321
You've been here

31:45.405 --> 31:48.157
three years next May.

31:48.283 --> 31:49.951
Five years in July.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.161
Government service ranking
is seven.

31:52.245 --> 31:56.082
You're due for
an in-grade raise in May?

31:56.207 --> 31:59.335
Yes, sir.
That part's all true.

32:04.757 --> 32:07.719
Captain, this is
a hell of a note.

32:07.802 --> 32:09.095
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:09.178 --> 32:10.722
I mean it.

32:10.805 --> 32:12.599
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:19.105 --> 32:21.274
I'll make sure
all your magazines get forwarded.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.192
Don't worry.

32:26.321 --> 32:29.282
Mr. Brubaker,
the smartest thing you ever done

32:29.365 --> 32:31.451
was come in here incognizant.

32:31.618 --> 32:34.203
The dumbest was stepping forward.

32:34.329 --> 32:37.290
You want it, you got it.

32:37.373 --> 32:38.708
Bye.

32:47.216 --> 32:49.135
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

32:49.218 --> 32:51.512
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

32:51.596 --> 32:53.640
<i>The name is Henry Brubaker.</i>

32:53.723 --> 32:57.226
<i>I'm what the governor
promised, a reform warden.</i>

32:57.393 --> 33:00.813
That sneaks in like
James fucking Bond.

33:00.897 --> 33:03.024
All right. Yeah!

33:04.359 --> 33:06.611
Purcell, give me that.

33:10.740 --> 33:13.076
<i>See this?
This thing is gone.</i>

33:15.912 --> 33:18.498
<i>Any trusty who wants
to go back to raking rocks</i>

33:18.623 --> 33:22.502
<i>just get caught using this
on one of your charges.</i>

33:22.585 --> 33:25.963
If an inmate attempts an escape

33:26.089 --> 33:27.757
do we wave so long?

33:27.882 --> 33:28.925
<i>Shoot him.</i>

33:30.093 --> 33:31.177
What?

33:31.302 --> 33:35.139
<i>Shoot him. Wound him if you can.</i>

33:35.264 --> 33:37.183
<i>Nobody is getting paroled anymore</i>

33:37.266 --> 33:39.769
<i>for trying to kill
escaping inmates.</i>

33:41.437 --> 33:43.356
<i>Let's get something straight.</i>

33:44.107 --> 33:46.442
<i>I figure most of you guys
belong here.</i>

33:47.193 --> 33:51.531
<i>You don't have any respect
for other people or yourselves.</i>

33:51.614 --> 33:56.202
<i>You want more from me,
you'll have to earn it.</i>

33:56.285 --> 34:00.790
<i>We'll make this run
like a 20th-century farm.</i>

34:00.957 --> 34:03.376
<i>You'll stop selling blood
to buy decent food.</i>

34:03.501 --> 34:06.587
<i>You'll go out
and plant vegetables.</i>

34:06.671 --> 34:09.172
Why you got your bubbles on?

34:09.257 --> 34:11.676
Women can't come in here.

34:11.759 --> 34:14.679
It's all right, Ruben.

34:16.514 --> 34:19.391
<i>I don't want 15-hour shifts.</i>

34:19.559 --> 34:23.062
<i>The beef raised here on this farm</i>

34:23.146 --> 34:25.898
<i>will be eaten by everyone.</i>

34:25.982 --> 34:27.650
What the...

34:29.527 --> 34:31.446
Son of a bitch.

34:31.529 --> 34:33.489
He was an army lieutenant.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.574
He ran a military stockade.

34:35.658 --> 34:36.951
Uh, to enforce...

34:37.034 --> 34:38.911
This is ridiculous.

34:38.995 --> 34:41.998
He taught penology
at Price University...

34:42.081 --> 34:44.292
How old are you?

34:44.375 --> 34:45.460
40.

34:45.543 --> 34:48.129
To enforce state laws.

34:48.212 --> 34:49.505
This is ridiculous.

34:49.589 --> 34:51.549
It's "to enforce the laws..."

34:51.632 --> 34:54.051
We've got angry...

34:54.135 --> 34:57.013
...prison without taking
a loyalty oath.

34:57.096 --> 34:58.931
To enforce state laws.

34:59.015 --> 35:00.975
Enforce state laws.

35:02.018 --> 35:04.395
To be respectful
to my superiors.

35:04.479 --> 35:06.814
To be respectful
to my superiors.

35:06.898 --> 35:10.151
And to faithfully perform
the duties of this office.

35:10.234 --> 35:12.653
No publicity on this.

35:12.737 --> 35:15.114
People are on your side.

35:15.198 --> 35:16.616
It's strong stuff.

35:16.699 --> 35:19.035
I mean it, no publicity.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.453
I quite agree.

35:20.536 --> 35:22.413
To be loyal to...

35:22.497 --> 35:25.583
I can't be kept in the dark

35:25.666 --> 35:27.752
on something like this.

35:27.835 --> 35:31.798
Chairman of the prison board
is expected to approve

35:31.881 --> 35:35.218
everything
pertaining to the prison.

35:35.343 --> 35:39.722
I hope you won't scream
for free-world guards.

35:39.806 --> 35:44.393
How long have you been on
the prison board?

35:44.560 --> 35:46.437
17 years.

35:46.521 --> 35:48.439
Print it.

35:49.941 --> 35:52.026
What do you think
of our new warden?

35:53.528 --> 35:59.367
I wonder what his first order
of business will be.

35:59.450 --> 36:01.369
Blow the place up.

36:01.452 --> 36:02.662
Start from scratch.

36:05.373 --> 36:07.667
You're making a joke, of course.

36:12.755 --> 36:14.173
Of course.

36:14.257 --> 36:16.634
Oh, yes.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.315
Learn much?

36:31.399 --> 36:32.733
Not enough.

36:32.817 --> 36:34.986
I've never seen anything like this.

36:35.069 --> 36:36.988
There isn't anything like this.

36:37.071 --> 36:40.074
The problem isn't
just inside the prison.

36:40.157 --> 36:43.202
That's why I have to move fast.

36:43.286 --> 36:44.537
Carefully.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.122
Same thing, Lillian.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.040
Henry, this is very important.

36:48.124 --> 36:49.166
No kidding.

36:52.211 --> 36:56.841
You're one of the strangest
individuals I've ever seen.

36:56.924 --> 37:00.094
I've got an 11:00.
What's the problem?

37:00.177 --> 37:03.681
She said you're
the most punctual individual

37:03.764 --> 37:05.725
she's ever known.

37:05.808 --> 37:07.226
I'll call you later.

37:07.310 --> 37:09.353
I know you will.

37:14.025 --> 37:15.860
Man, this is pathetic.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.361
That's it, Purcell.

37:17.445 --> 37:19.238
That's all I've got.

37:19.322 --> 37:21.198
Well, you're out of luck.

37:21.282 --> 37:23.492
I need a desk job, like you.

37:23.576 --> 37:25.745
Anyway, you's overworked.

37:25.828 --> 37:28.456
It ain't up to me.

37:28.539 --> 37:31.709
Purcell, can I see you a minute?

37:31.792 --> 37:33.210
Yeah.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.212
I got this...

37:35.296 --> 37:39.717
I love what you did
with Deach out there.

37:39.800 --> 37:43.220
A lot of people
will like that.

37:43.304 --> 37:45.681
Who was that lady,
by the way?

37:46.849 --> 37:49.226
The day I came in

37:49.310 --> 37:52.063
trusties put a man on, gunshot wound.

37:52.188 --> 37:53.397
Uh-huh.

37:54.982 --> 37:56.400
Is he okay?

37:56.484 --> 37:57.902
What do you mean?

37:58.027 --> 38:00.321
I mean, is he okay?

38:00.571 --> 38:03.366
Is he back in the barracks?

38:03.532 --> 38:06.661
I imagine he's at
the county hospital,

38:06.744 --> 38:08.287
don%you?

38:08.371 --> 38:10.039
Find out.

38:10.539 --> 38:13.042
And could you get me

38:13.125 --> 38:15.002
a dozen pair of sunglasses, please?

38:15.336 --> 38:17.421
All right.

38:18.214 --> 38:21.384
You want them polarized or tinted?

38:21.467 --> 38:24.136
You want the kind
with the little mirrors?

38:24.261 --> 38:25.680
People can't see in.

38:25.763 --> 38:27.139
Makes them nervous as hell.

38:27.223 --> 38:29.976
Just the regular glasses.

38:30.059 --> 38:31.394
You got 'em.

38:36.899 --> 38:38.067
Look, Captain...

38:38.150 --> 38:40.236
Don't call me Captain.

38:42.863 --> 38:44.281
Mr. Brubaker,

38:45.491 --> 38:47.827
I know you're probably getting ready

38:47.910 --> 38:50.788
to make some new
job assignments around here.

38:50.871 --> 38:52.832
You'll probably even name

38:52.915 --> 38:55.376
your own warden's clerk.

38:55.501 --> 39:00.006
I'd like to make a case for myself.

39:05.011 --> 39:06.012
Uh...

39:09.807 --> 39:11.058
Ha ha.

39:11.142 --> 39:14.729
I know I'm not
the smartest guy in the world

39:14.854 --> 39:17.606
but I do know this job.

39:18.065 --> 39:20.484
And I know this damn place

39:20.568 --> 39:23.487
better than any man here,
and that's a fact.

39:23.696 --> 39:26.365
I've been the warden's clerk
for eight years.

39:26.615 --> 39:27.908
I know it.

39:30.745 --> 39:32.663
What you got here, mainly,

39:32.747 --> 39:34.373
are rural people,

39:34.457 --> 39:36.834
you know what I mean?

39:36.917 --> 39:39.879
They're not much at paperwork.

39:39.962 --> 39:42.631
No sophistication. They...

39:43.549 --> 39:45.342
I'm not trying to
put anybody down.

39:45.426 --> 39:47.386
Don't get me wrong.

39:47.470 --> 39:51.599
I'm just telling you
the way it is.

39:53.017 --> 39:54.810
What are you in for, Purcell?

39:54.977 --> 39:57.480
Nothing, really. I...

39:57.563 --> 39:59.148
Nothing?

39:59.356 --> 40:02.401
I held up a card game.

40:02.485 --> 40:03.486
Ha ha.

40:03.611 --> 40:04.987
Pretty stupid, huh?

40:05.071 --> 40:06.947
Undoubtedly they were cheating you?

40:08.449 --> 40:10.034
Absolutely.

40:11.494 --> 40:13.120
That's a fact.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.877
Anyway, uh...

40:19.960 --> 40:23.047
You need something,
I'm your man, okay?

40:24.340 --> 40:26.258
Well, just the sunglasses for now.

40:26.342 --> 40:27.676
You got 'em.

40:28.844 --> 40:29.929
They all for you?

40:30.012 --> 40:31.180
None for me.

40:32.348 --> 40:33.766
Got you.

40:35.643 --> 40:39.188
What are you going to do
about my parakeet?

40:39.271 --> 40:41.232
Abraham, come on.

40:41.315 --> 40:43.192
Tell your story walking.

40:43.275 --> 40:45.694
Yeah, I know.
Your poor bird.

40:45.778 --> 40:47.196
Roy, Roy.

40:47.279 --> 40:50.241
Do I get the desk job?

40:50.324 --> 40:53.244
I got a desk job for you.

40:53.327 --> 40:54.703
Spell ophthalmology.

40:54.787 --> 40:56.747
Say what?

40:56.831 --> 40:58.457
Jesus.

40:59.041 --> 41:01.043
Come on. Come on.

41:32.867 --> 41:35.744
Let these men out daily,
not every six months.

41:35.828 --> 41:37.413
All right, sir.

41:39.081 --> 41:41.500
Purcell, I want to see
Bullen tonight.

41:41.584 --> 41:44.920
Now let's look at look
at that boiler.

42:02.396 --> 42:04.982
You say come in?

42:05.065 --> 42:07.610
I don't like being here.

42:07.693 --> 42:09.111
Looks like
I'm sucking up to the man.

42:09.195 --> 42:10.779
You know what I mean?

42:14.158 --> 42:15.826
You're a lifer.

42:15.910 --> 42:17.369
Habitual criminal.

42:17.453 --> 42:18.746
Big bitch.

42:19.914 --> 42:21.665
Don't get on my bad side.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.210
Word is that I'm dangerous.

42:24.293 --> 42:26.462
How about setting
that weapon aside?

42:31.675 --> 42:33.302
How about you
take off them glasses?

42:42.478 --> 42:46.774
It says here they put you away
for breaking a toilet.

42:48.025 --> 42:50.069
Says you quit school
in the third grade.

42:50.152 --> 42:52.279
I ain't never quit nothin'.

42:53.572 --> 42:55.074
Born in Louisiana,

42:55.157 --> 42:58.327
twin brother run over
by a train at 15

42:58.535 --> 43:01.455
while trying to escape
a reformatory.

43:01.622 --> 43:05.334
They shot Hollis
and laid him on the tracks

43:05.417 --> 43:07.086
so the train would squash him

43:07.169 --> 43:09.588
and make it look like an accident.

43:11.674 --> 43:13.217
Kind of soured me, you know?

43:14.218 --> 43:16.178
I got away...

43:16.262 --> 43:18.097
Got arrested for stealing

43:18.180 --> 43:19.306
a '65 Pontiac sedan.

43:20.349 --> 43:22.309
I got two years for that

43:22.393 --> 43:24.311
and I done them.

43:24.687 --> 43:27.106
I got arrested for stealing

43:27.189 --> 43:29.275
a '69 Pontiac convertible.

43:29.358 --> 43:30.943
You big on Pontiacs?

43:31.026 --> 43:33.696
Bone white,

43:33.821 --> 43:36.073
leather oxblood upholstery,

43:36.240 --> 43:38.826
big, huge chrome fender skirts.

43:38.993 --> 43:40.077
How do they compare?

43:41.245 --> 43:44.290
They fucked up the engine in '69,
if you ask me.

43:46.834 --> 43:48.294
I got three years for that.

43:48.377 --> 43:49.795
Another felony.

43:49.878 --> 43:51.839
Then come the toilet.

43:51.922 --> 43:54.967
I got picked up for vagrancy,
misdemeanor.

43:55.050 --> 43:57.803
The next morning,
the toilet's broken.

43:57.886 --> 44:02.891
There's six men in the cell
and they stick me with it.

44:03.183 --> 44:06.312
Felony number three, habitual.

44:08.397 --> 44:10.357
That judge gives you life
for a toilet.

44:10.441 --> 44:12.401
Yeah, or give me
the toilet for life.

44:14.653 --> 44:17.531
Now I'm shoveling shit
for dead men.

44:19.616 --> 44:22.119
Instead, how would you
like to be a trusty,

44:22.202 --> 44:24.538
and run my motor pool?

44:24.830 --> 44:25.831
Ahem.

44:27.583 --> 44:30.377
Mr. Brubaker,
I've been studying you

44:30.461 --> 44:32.713
since you first come in,

44:32.796 --> 44:34.131
and it's come clear to me

44:34.214 --> 44:37.801
that you are one weird
fucking individual.

44:37.885 --> 44:39.928
I ain't got you
figured out yet,

44:40.012 --> 44:42.014
whether you're good or bad.

44:43.223 --> 44:44.933
Does that mean you'll
run my motor pool?

44:46.727 --> 44:48.687
Wear them khakis

44:48.771 --> 44:51.482
and get me a guitar,

44:51.565 --> 44:53.609
be the warden's new boy?

44:55.778 --> 44:57.863
No. You're smarter than that.

44:57.946 --> 45:00.532
The whole world's
fucked up, Mr. Brubaker.

45:00.616 --> 45:01.784
Yeah.

45:02.034 --> 45:03.952
It ain't no use.

45:06.121 --> 45:07.498
(THUNDER)

45:14.254 --> 45:16.173
Tower number three.

45:16.256 --> 45:19.551
Who am I looking at?
He's looking at me.

45:19.718 --> 45:21.887
Up there, you got
Douglas Mizell.

45:21.970 --> 45:23.305
Who's Doug Mizell?

45:23.430 --> 45:24.890
He's a forger.

45:24.973 --> 45:27.059
Three times grand theft.

45:29.728 --> 45:33.482
I want a run-down on everybody
that's got tower duty.

45:34.733 --> 45:36.860
That's Purcell's job, sir.

45:36.944 --> 45:38.654
L.-

45:40.322 --> 45:42.074
I want only murderers up there,

45:42.157 --> 45:43.534
one-time impulse killers.

45:45.202 --> 45:47.996
Aren't you taking
kind of a chance doing that?

45:48.372 --> 45:50.416
It's the habituals you can't trust.

45:51.375 --> 45:54.753
Most murderers already have it
out of their system.

45:54.837 --> 45:57.005
Guys like you, right?

45:57.256 --> 45:58.674
Ha ha ha.

46:00.300 --> 46:03.387
There's nobody
around here like me.

46:03.512 --> 46:04.513
Oh.

46:06.807 --> 46:09.435
On death row, Why'd you let me go?

46:09.518 --> 46:12.646
You tell me.
You're the man.

46:17.359 --> 46:20.320
You're trying to cover
yourself both ways.

46:22.364 --> 46:23.532
You're in for murder, aren't you?

46:23.615 --> 46:26.869
I thought you asked me
to come here so you...

46:26.994 --> 46:30.330
All this good land,
acreage, livestock

46:30.414 --> 46:33.083
and everybody is starving.

46:33.167 --> 46:34.877
Except guys like you.

(TIMER DINGS)

47:09.453 --> 47:10.662

you eating.

47:13.415 --> 47:15.542
Oh. Know a lot
about nutrition?

47:16.460 --> 47:17.961
I know about hungry.

47:18.045 --> 47:20.464
You like being a trusty?

47:20.547 --> 47:21.798
(THUNDER)

47:23.634 --> 47:25.469
Better than being a rank man.

47:25.594 --> 47:28.931
I'll bet you've seen
a lot of reform wardens.

47:29.139 --> 47:31.558
Every one was a reform warden.

47:31.642 --> 47:33.602
Not Renfro.

47:33.685 --> 47:35.604
Not Renfro?

47:35.938 --> 47:36.939
Uh-uh.

47:37.105 --> 47:40.150
Where did the rank men's
clothes come from?

47:40.234 --> 47:43.654
Think we got a special
factory that makes rags?

47:43.737 --> 47:45.614
Renfro got those brand-new

47:45.697 --> 47:48.158
just like the ones you're bringing in.

47:48.242 --> 47:49.660
They'll be the same rags,

47:49.743 --> 47:51.537
the next reform warden throws out.

47:51.620 --> 47:54.581
Let me ask you about
being a trusty.

47:56.041 --> 47:58.418
When you're out in the fields,

47:59.211 --> 48:00.671
holding your gun,

48:01.171 --> 48:03.215
holding all the cards,

48:03.298 --> 48:05.551
what keeps you from taking off?

48:05.634 --> 48:09.054
Uh, Mr. Brubaker, sir...

48:09.137 --> 48:13.642
I wouldn't be putting these ideas
in nobody's head.

48:14.560 --> 48:16.937
One day, we could
lay down our shovels

48:17.020 --> 48:19.690
and our guns,
and stop playing the man's game,

48:19.773 --> 48:21.483
pick up and run off.

<i>Galveston, oh, Galveston</i>

52:58.844 --> 53:04.349
<i>I can hear
your sea waves crashin'</i>

53:04.432 --> 53:09.688
<i>While I watch
the cannons splashin'</i>

53:09.771 --> 53:12.816
<i>I clean my gun</i>

53:12.899 --> 53:15.402
<i>And dream of Galveston</i>

53:21.658 --> 53:24.870
Looking good, Warden.

53:24.953 --> 53:27.372
Willets,

53:28.915 --> 53:30.584
you just took delivery

53:30.667 --> 53:33.211
on 300 cases
of chili last week.

53:33.295 --> 53:34.880
Where are they now?

53:34.963 --> 53:37.340
No. I just looked in the locker.

53:37.424 --> 53:39.342
The boys gobble it up?

53:40.135 --> 53:42.053
Not the rank men.

53:42.137 --> 53:44.556
There's only 50 trusties.

53:44.639 --> 53:47.058
That comes to 7,200 cans

53:47.142 --> 53:49.936
divided by 50 trusties.

53:50.020 --> 53:52.606
That comes to 144 cans.

53:52.772 --> 53:54.608
You correct me if I'm wrong.

53:54.691 --> 53:57.152
You're going too fast for me.

53:57.360 --> 54:00.030
Divided by seven days,

54:00.113 --> 54:05.076
that comes to 20.5 cans of chili

54:05.160 --> 54:07.245
per trusty per day.

54:07.329 --> 54:08.622
Does that tell you anything?

54:08.705 --> 54:10.123
Willets?

54:10.206 --> 54:13.168
Are you alive, Willets?

54:13.335 --> 54:14.544
No, sir.

54:15.170 --> 54:17.756
The roof just fell in.

54:17.839 --> 54:19.132
People are starving.

54:19.257 --> 54:21.635
Where's all the food
going around here?

54:21.718 --> 54:23.136
Purcell.

54:23.219 --> 54:24.638
Sir?

54:24.846 --> 54:27.974
Regulation outfits from now on

54:28.183 --> 54:30.936
or prison-issue pants,
boots, and shirts.

54:31.019 --> 54:32.562
We don't have any boots.

54:32.854 --> 54:34.314
Well, order them.

54:34.397 --> 54:36.149
That's Willets' area, acquisition.

54:36.232 --> 54:38.568
No, you order them.

54:38.693 --> 54:40.779
I need about 700 pairs

54:40.862 --> 54:43.114
and no more shaved heads!

54:43.198 --> 54:45.158
Yeah. But sizes!

54:45.700 --> 54:46.826
You know that.

54:46.910 --> 54:48.536
Yes. I'll be ready.

54:49.079 --> 54:52.666
God damn, look at you, new blood.

54:52.749 --> 54:54.334
That's what this place needs.

54:54.417 --> 54:56.336
You're Brubaker, right?

54:57.212 --> 54:58.296
Right.

54:58.380 --> 55:01.216
You don't look like no warden.

55:02.717 --> 55:05.720
Chocolate prune cake in there.

55:05.804 --> 55:08.223
My missus baked it up
special for you.

55:09.599 --> 55:11.935
I hate prunes.
They cloud my mind.

55:12.602 --> 55:14.771
Did I say my name?

55:14.854 --> 55:16.940
No. But I know you.

55:17.107 --> 55:20.193
C.P. Woodward.
Call me Woody.

55:20.318 --> 55:21.820
Can I help you?

55:22.237 --> 55:23.571
Roof.

55:23.655 --> 55:24.906
What?

55:24.990 --> 55:27.033
I came about the roof.

55:28.576 --> 55:30.328
Purcell said you'd declared

55:30.412 --> 55:32.914
a state of emergency or something.

55:36.876 --> 55:39.254
I thought you just sell lumber.

55:39.337 --> 55:42.215
I sell it, I grow it.

55:42.298 --> 55:43.758
I got wood in my veins.

55:45.176 --> 55:47.762
Just give me your John Hancock.

55:47.846 --> 55:50.390
We'll fix things up tight.

55:50.598 --> 55:52.058
No. Hold it, now.

55:52.142 --> 55:55.603
Shouldn't you see the roof first?

55:55.729 --> 55:57.814
Whatever we find, we'll fix.

55:57.981 --> 56:04.029
You get one pinprick hole
in that tarpaper from the factory...

56:04.154 --> 56:06.406
This isn't a question of pinpricks.

56:06.489 --> 56:08.116
You built that thing wrong

56:08.324 --> 56:12.787
and I want you to rebuild it.

56:12.996 --> 56:14.956
Of course you do.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.458
I'll help with the cost.

56:16.583 --> 56:19.294
I'll bill only my materials.

56:19.377 --> 56:22.088
This won't cost me anything.

56:22.213 --> 56:23.715
You guarantee your work?

56:23.840 --> 56:25.675
Of course.

56:25.759 --> 56:30.013
You get on top
of this shit pile

56:30.180 --> 56:32.724
and then the job's
not such a ballbuster.

56:32.807 --> 56:35.143
You'll be happier then.

56:36.770 --> 56:38.605
I'm not complaining.

56:38.688 --> 56:41.649
Are you unhappy?
It sure sounds like it to me.

56:52.494 --> 56:54.746
I'm not in this business for my health.

56:54.829 --> 56:56.790
Or anybody else's.

56:56.998 --> 56:59.292
I'm doing my inventory.

56:59.375 --> 57:01.586
It's a pain in the ass.

57:01.669 --> 57:05.173
Ain't been anybody from Wakefield
helping me lately.

57:05.298 --> 57:08.510
We're not sending
convicts to you anymore.

57:08.676 --> 57:09.844
That's slave labor.

57:10.136 --> 57:12.305
It is not.

57:12.680 --> 57:15.016
You got it all backwards,

57:15.183 --> 57:17.644
because this is a community.

57:17.769 --> 57:19.312
The people around here

57:19.395 --> 57:21.648
don't ostracize this prison.

57:21.773 --> 57:22.982
We accept it.

57:23.191 --> 57:24.651
We cooperate.

57:24.776 --> 57:27.237
It's a two-way street.

57:27.320 --> 57:31.825
You'll see a lot of nice things

57:31.908 --> 57:34.577
from people in
the farm supply business,

57:34.661 --> 57:35.954
clothing business...

57:36.037 --> 57:37.413
Lumber business.

57:37.956 --> 57:40.458
Yeah. Take that cake.

57:40.542 --> 57:43.044
The point ain't whether
you like prune.

57:43.670 --> 57:45.797
It's the thought that counts.

57:45.880 --> 57:47.215
Exactly.

57:47.382 --> 57:51.219
Just accept the stuff,
keep your mouth shut

57:51.386 --> 57:54.514
and let things run
like they've been going for 100 years,

57:54.597 --> 57:56.391
before we was born.

57:57.892 --> 58:00.270
I'm talking about tradition.

58:00.395 --> 58:02.772
Don't fuck with tradition.

58:03.314 --> 58:05.608
Count your own woodpile, Woody.

58:05.733 --> 58:07.527
I'll fix my own roof.

58:08.403 --> 58:11.239
A lot of people will be
disappointed in you.

58:11.322 --> 58:13.449
It won't be the first time.

58:14.117 --> 58:15.368
I hope you're right.

58:15.451 --> 58:16.536
Take this.

58:18.788 --> 58:22.125
Get me all the contracts on that roof.

58:22.208 --> 58:23.960
I want everything.

58:24.711 --> 58:26.796
Whose team you on?

58:27.213 --> 58:29.132
What can I say?

58:29.215 --> 58:31.134
He's the coach.

58:31.217 --> 58:32.844
Short season.

58:40.602 --> 58:42.770
Oh, no, it's no secret.

58:42.854 --> 58:45.273
They write it all down.

58:45.398 --> 58:50.445
Prison lumber and labor
is building people's swimming pools.

58:50.737 --> 58:52.030
That's right.

58:52.614 --> 58:56.993
My trusty is loading our food
into state police cars.

58:57.076 --> 59:00.246
It runs that deep?

59:00.330 --> 59:02.290
We're stepping on more toes
than I imagined.

59:04.250 --> 59:06.169
What's that?

59:09.881 --> 59:11.216
I'm just warning you,

59:11.299 --> 59:13.801
because you're likely
to start hearing things.

59:14.010 --> 59:16.888
I'll be ready to run
interference for you.

59:18.306 --> 59:20.642
I'll talk to the governor.

59:21.935 --> 59:23.770
Can I call you back?

59:24.979 --> 59:25.980
Uh-huh.

59:26.314 --> 59:27.357
Bye.

59:27.440 --> 59:28.441
(DIAL TONE)

59:45.583 --> 59:47.877
Give me some of that stuff!

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:45.977
Where, uh, where's Huey Rauch?

01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:47.520
I don't see him around.

01:01:18.426 --> 01:01:20.136
Smell this.

01:01:24.265 --> 01:01:25.516
I'm a city boy.

01:01:26.017 --> 01:01:27.268
Purcell?

01:01:34.901 --> 01:01:36.694
That smells like kerosene.

01:02:17.944 --> 01:02:20.238
This animal's been shot.
You know anything about it?

01:02:23.866 --> 01:02:26.786
What about that truck out there?

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:28.746
Looked like a free worlder.

01:02:52.186 --> 01:02:54.188
Now what are these?

01:02:54.272 --> 01:02:56.149
I don't know.

01:02:59.735 --> 01:03:00.987
Shacks.

01:03:01.195 --> 01:03:03.698
Are they on our property?

01:03:04.198 --> 01:03:06.117
Let me think.

01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:10.371
Honestly...

01:03:10.997 --> 01:03:12.373
Yeah!

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.208
I think.

01:03:14.542 --> 01:03:15.710
Shit.

01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:25.178
I don't know who's in there
or what you're up to

01:03:25.261 --> 01:03:28.806
but we got the new warden,
and we're probably coming in!

01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:30.224
Right?

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.269
(VOICES)

01:03:36.022 --> 01:03:37.690
Probably nobody home.

01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:41.027
I ain't hiding in the dark

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:43.112
like no human insect.

01:03:48.493 --> 01:03:49.869
Yeah? What?

01:03:50.745 --> 01:03:52.622
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:03:53.122 --> 01:03:56.584
Get out here
and take care of this.

01:03:57.293 --> 01:03:59.837
Excuse me, I have
a tight schedule.

01:04:00.588 --> 01:04:04.342
<i>TELEVISION: ...like some animal
with one thing on his mind.</i>

01:04:04.425 --> 01:04:07.637
<i>Oh, Mother,
even kids can have sex.</i>

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:10.264
<i>Is that what
you do at parties?</i>

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.517
How many out there?

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.185
Three, four.

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:17.772
<i>I don't want you
getting a reputation.</i>

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:18.898
Pull it up.

01:04:18.981 --> 01:04:21.526
<i>I already have one.
The wrong kind.</i>

01:04:23.736 --> 01:04:26.864
<i>Marry a man
who respects you.</i>

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:29.617
<i>I want you to have
a good name.</i>

01:04:30.952 --> 01:04:32.828
<i>You! You want!</i>

01:04:32.954 --> 01:04:34.830
<i>Is that all you can say?</i>

01:04:35.623 --> 01:04:39.794
Uh... You want a beer or something?

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:42.797
<i>Don't talk like that again!</i>

01:04:50.304 --> 01:04:53.224
<i>The improved Veg-o-Matic
stretches food dollars.</i>

01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:55.226
<i>Millions bought at $7.77.</i>

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:57.562
<i>Now yours for only $5.77.</i>

01:04:57.645 --> 01:04:59.480
<i>You'll save $2.00!</i>

01:04:59.564 --> 01:05:01.524
Where's your wallet at?

01:05:01.607 --> 01:05:03.401
<i>Veg-0-Matic can cut
a whole, firm tomato,</i>

01:05:03.484 --> 01:05:05.152
<i>in one stroke!</i>

01:05:05.945 --> 01:05:07.947
That's my personal property.

01:05:09.323 --> 01:05:10.825
I'm going.

01:05:11.492 --> 01:05:14.870
<i>Save $2.00 from the former price.</i>

01:05:14.954 --> 01:05:18.165
<i>Get one today for only $5.77.</i>

01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:23.921
Let me give you...

01:05:24.005 --> 01:05:26.007
I got it. I got it.

01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:36.976
Hot dog!
Look what we got here.

01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:40.021
That be Warden Renfro's
monthly supply.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.441
Man took baths in that stuff.

01:05:47.528 --> 01:05:48.946
Come on. Come on.

01:05:50.865 --> 01:05:55.077
Willets,
stay with me on this one.

01:05:55.161 --> 01:05:58.331
Men work all day growing produce

01:05:58.414 --> 01:06:01.584
so the warden
and the trusties could sell

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:03.544
at below market value

01:06:03.628 --> 01:06:08.507
using the proceeds to buy
more chili and soda

01:06:08.674 --> 01:06:13.512
which could be resold
at an even greater profit.

01:06:14.096 --> 01:06:15.222
You think so?

01:06:15.723 --> 01:06:16.849
Think so?

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:20.478
You've been signing it out,
haven't you?

01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:24.315
I signed what
Captain Renfro told me to.

01:06:25.775 --> 01:06:27.526
Sign your own
severance check, Willets,

01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:28.986
because you're fired.

01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:30.321
I'm in civil service.

01:06:30.404 --> 01:06:31.906
Fired.

01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:44.377
Uh, boy!

01:06:57.890 --> 01:07:01.560
How do we handle
purchasing without Willets?

01:07:01.644 --> 01:07:02.937
They Will do it.

01:07:03.604 --> 01:07:04.897
Who?

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:08.526
They'll have an election.
Pick an inmate council.

01:07:10.528 --> 01:07:12.405
That's a hell of an idea.

01:07:12.488 --> 01:07:13.656
What?

01:07:13.823 --> 01:07:15.783
That's a hell of an idea!

01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:28.754
Huey! Glad to see you back.

01:07:28.963 --> 01:07:31.632
Something real funny about that?

01:07:31.799 --> 01:07:33.801
I can't wait till
you break out of here.

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.302
We all got bets on that.

01:07:38.639 --> 01:07:40.850
That's funny.

01:07:43.519 --> 01:07:48.274
Brubaker's been turning this place
into a damn jailhouse.

01:07:48.357 --> 01:07:51.902
He just doesn't know
who's running the place.

01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:53.904
Deach will set him straight.

01:07:53.988 --> 01:07:56.157
Floyd,

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.408
get out of here.

01:07:57.491 --> 01:07:58.576
What?

01:07:58.659 --> 01:07:59.994
Get out.

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:01.746
I live here.

01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:04.665
Get your stuff and get out!

01:08:04.832 --> 01:08:07.626
I got to move in here.
This is mine now.

01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:14.091
Get my bird,
pack the rest of my stuff.

01:08:14.175 --> 01:08:16.051
Let's go.

01:08:23.267 --> 01:08:25.810
Spivey, take that shack over there.

01:08:25.895 --> 01:08:27.854
Bullen, take that one.

01:08:46.582 --> 01:08:50.169
It would be smarter
to do this during daylight.

01:08:50.294 --> 01:08:52.129
People wouldn't see it.

01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:55.841
Maybe that's exactly
why he's doing it now.

01:09:17.238 --> 01:09:18.823
He's crazy.

01:09:19.365 --> 01:09:20.741
No, he's not.

01:09:21.075 --> 01:09:23.035
He's dangerous.

01:09:23.118 --> 01:09:25.412
Somebody needs
to stop him.

01:09:26.538 --> 01:09:28.122
Put a bullet in him.

01:09:37.758 --> 01:09:40.301
There's a disease
growing in there, Henry.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.470
Hostile to your health.

01:09:42.971 --> 01:09:44.348
I know that.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.684
You ought to get yourself some

01:09:46.767 --> 01:09:48.853
paper cups or plates or something.

01:09:51.564 --> 01:09:52.564
Ah ha!

01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:54.692
(OPENS CAN)

01:09:54.942 --> 01:09:58.737
You ought to get yourself
someone to look after you.

01:10:00.364 --> 01:10:02.324
That doesn't sound like
the kind of advice

01:10:02.408 --> 01:10:04.159
I'd expect from you.

01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:06.954
No. I meant...

01:10:07.079 --> 01:10:08.706
I meant one of those convicts.

01:10:10.416 --> 01:10:11.917
So how's it going?

01:10:16.297 --> 01:10:18.215
If the Chinese invade us,

01:10:18.299 --> 01:10:20.134
I got insurance.

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:24.513
If we have a landslide,
earthquake, a volcano erupts,

01:10:24.597 --> 01:10:25.764
I'm covered.

01:10:25.848 --> 01:10:28.183
If my roof caves in, nothing.

01:10:28.267 --> 01:10:29.894
No insurance.

01:10:30.978 --> 01:10:32.229
What are you going to do?

01:10:32.313 --> 01:10:34.148
Going to rebuild it ourselves.

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:35.316
Terrific!

01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:36.567
Terrific?

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:39.570
The governor's been
wanting to come down here.

01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:41.071
It's a perfect time.

01:10:41.155 --> 01:10:43.240
He'll actually see
something happening.

01:10:43.407 --> 01:10:46.660
He wants to have pictures taken,
shake a few hands,

01:10:46.744 --> 01:10:48.913
put his arm around an inmate.

01:10:48.996 --> 01:10:51.165
It's what you all call
a photo opportunity.

01:10:51.248 --> 01:10:52.750
Tom's not like that.

01:10:52.833 --> 01:10:55.252
- I don't know what Tom's like.
- He hired you.

01:10:55.336 --> 01:10:57.922
I need a doctor here,
not a governor.

01:10:58.005 --> 01:11:00.049
- You need both.
- I know what I need.

01:11:00.132 --> 01:11:02.426
No. I know what you need.

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:05.054
It's a complex world out there.

01:11:05.137 --> 01:11:07.932
I'm dealing with people
who would much rather

01:11:08.015 --> 01:11:10.976
not see that prison
change at all.

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:13.938
Well, they're sure
letting me know about it.

01:11:14.021 --> 01:11:16.315
I'm being hit from all sides.

01:11:16.398 --> 01:11:18.275
People are shooting my cattle.

01:11:18.525 --> 01:11:20.861
I got trusties sabotaging my crops.

01:11:20.945 --> 01:11:22.905
There's nothing I can do.

01:11:22.988 --> 01:11:24.365
Why not?

01:11:25.366 --> 01:11:27.576
Well, do you know what happens,

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.245
if I send a trusty back into the barracks?

01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:32.122
He's dead.

01:11:32.206 --> 01:11:34.583
The other men will kill him.

01:11:34.667 --> 01:11:36.210
Change their attitude.

01:11:36.877 --> 01:11:38.212
I'm trying,

01:11:38.462 --> 01:11:40.506
but I got to deliver.

01:11:40.589 --> 01:11:42.758
I can't come in here
and just paint this place.

01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:46.178
- Lillian?
- Hmm?

01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:47.596
A permanent doctor.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.224
Yeah, I know.
I am getting you one.

01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:54.687
Look, there's a prison board
meeting on Tuesday night.

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:56.313
I want you there.

01:11:57.272 --> 01:11:59.066
The great diplomat?

01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:00.317
Ah ha ha!

01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:01.777
I'll take that risk.

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.738
There's some deputy warden
from out of state

01:12:04.822 --> 01:12:07.741
who's giving a talk
on prison reform.

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:12.413
I see, and you want me there
to defend myself.

01:12:12.496 --> 01:12:15.374
No. I want a second opinion
in that room, Henry.

01:12:15.457 --> 01:12:17.835
State your case.
They need to meet you.

01:12:17.918 --> 01:12:19.795
I mean, you do make
an impression, right?

01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:21.505
Ha.

01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:40.524
All right!

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:07.217
Father, give him a kiss.

01:13:07.301 --> 01:13:09.678
<i>Vote for Frank Zaranska
He will help you</i>

01:13:09.762 --> 01:13:12.181
<i>Pray and he will pull for you</i>

01:13:12.306 --> 01:13:14.933
<i>Don't you listen
to them others</i>

01:13:15.017 --> 01:13:17.311
<i>They'll lie and cheat
and screw you</i>

01:13:24.985 --> 01:13:26.153
Warden!

01:13:48.634 --> 01:13:51.929
It's like sitting
on top of the world.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:00.687
God Almighty.

01:14:03.357 --> 01:14:06.360
You know what
I'd like to do with her?

01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:09.154
Yeah, I know what
you'd like to do.

01:14:11.073 --> 01:14:12.199
You're wrong.

01:14:14.118 --> 01:14:16.036
You ever just want to talk?

01:14:16.787 --> 01:14:17.788
Shit.

01:14:18.372 --> 01:14:20.332
You been whacking it so long

01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:24.044
your mind is starting
to collapse in on itself.

01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:40.102
Brubaker, that's the first time

01:14:40.227 --> 01:14:42.396
I've heard them laugh in 15 years.

01:14:42.563 --> 01:14:45.274
It doesn't bother you, does it?

01:14:53.031 --> 01:14:57.411
We need the right men
on that council

01:14:57.494 --> 01:15:01.039
because Brubaker
will use that council

01:15:01.123 --> 01:15:03.125
to take away your power.

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:07.212
He already took away
my refrigerator and lockers.

01:15:07.296 --> 01:15:09.214
He's changing the lock
on the gate!

01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:18.182
My name is Jerome L. Boyd.

01:15:18.265 --> 01:15:21.518
I got what is called
a sociopathic personality.

01:15:21.602 --> 01:15:25.272
That means I ain't got no feeling

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:27.524
for my fellow man.

01:15:27.608 --> 01:15:29.860
My parents fucked me up.

01:15:29.943 --> 01:15:32.237
Now, hold on a minute. Listen.

01:15:32.321 --> 01:15:36.867
I deem it an honor
to throw aside my hatred

01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:40.037
and help
all you dumb assholes.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:44.833
<i>(SINGING) Sometimes it
causes me to tremble!</i>

01:15:47.127 --> 01:15:49.922
Let there be a hush on the land.

01:15:50.005 --> 01:15:53.717
Gentlemen, Jesus come over
to my bunk here last Tuesday.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.053
You know what he said?

01:15:56.136 --> 01:15:57.930
What did he say?

01:15:58.013 --> 01:15:59.014
What?

01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:01.016
What did he say?

01:16:01.099 --> 01:16:04.978
Many is called,
but damn few is chosen.

01:16:05.062 --> 01:16:06.772
Amen!

01:16:06.855 --> 01:16:10.150
"I want you to put these boys

01:16:10.234 --> 01:16:12.069
"underneath your wing.

01:16:12.152 --> 01:16:15.072
"See that they get subscriptions

01:16:15.155 --> 01:16:18.951
"to any damn magazines they want!"

01:16:19.034 --> 01:16:20.869
All right! Yeah!

01:16:22.079 --> 01:16:25.624
<i>Frankie scores again
with a left hand.</i>

01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:30.087
Now, I am corrupt,

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:33.298
just like the rest of you.

01:16:33.382 --> 01:16:34.758
But,

01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:37.594
I am honest about it.

01:16:37.678 --> 01:16:42.307
Now, you vote for Mr. Clarence,

01:16:42.391 --> 01:16:45.185
know exactly what you get.

01:16:58.198 --> 01:16:59.283
Zaranska?

01:16:59.366 --> 01:17:00.534
Yes?

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:01.952
One vote.

01:17:02.035 --> 01:17:04.371
Don't be such an old woman.

01:17:04.496 --> 01:17:06.999
Feel the power!

01:17:07.165 --> 01:17:10.294
I feel mysterious
and wondrous workings within!

01:17:10.377 --> 01:17:12.838
Hallelujah!
Can I get a witness?

01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:14.298
The Lord is with us!

01:17:15.716 --> 01:17:16.883
Name?

01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:26.560
What about the doctor?

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:28.645
Supposed to be here this afternoon.

01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:31.898
They said he'd be here
three days ago.

01:17:32.024 --> 01:17:33.567
He's coming about 1:00.

01:17:33.692 --> 01:17:35.068
Double-check that.

01:17:35.152 --> 01:17:36.737
One more.

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:50.584
Well, what are you waiting for?

01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:54.129
We're waiting on you.

01:17:54.212 --> 01:17:56.465
You guys are the inmate council.

01:17:56.548 --> 01:17:58.133
Go on ahead.

01:17:58.216 --> 01:17:59.926
I'll be with you shortly.

01:18:12.356 --> 01:18:13.899
Hold on.

01:18:13.982 --> 01:18:16.276
That's not the way
I understood it worked.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.989
Lillian Gray got authorization
for you to get bids right away.

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.496
How long does his lunch take?

01:18:27.579 --> 01:18:29.748
When will he be back?

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:34.544
Yes.

01:18:34.628 --> 01:18:37.214
Would you please?

01:18:37.297 --> 01:18:38.799
Yes.

01:18:38.882 --> 01:18:40.467
Thank you.

01:18:41.635 --> 01:18:42.636
Oh.

01:18:58.652 --> 01:18:59.986
Something wrong?

01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:05.033
Don't know exactly where to start,
Mr. Brubaker.

01:19:05.117 --> 01:19:07.869
One man, one vote.
It's up to you.

01:19:07.953 --> 01:19:10.580
You stop what you don't like.

01:19:10.747 --> 01:19:12.082
No.

01:19:15.919 --> 01:19:17.003
All right, then.

01:19:17.129 --> 01:19:20.132
I make a motion that
we consider a movement

01:19:20.215 --> 01:19:23.760
to discuss the plumbing
in the barracks.

01:19:23.844 --> 01:19:25.345
How many say aye?

01:19:27.722 --> 01:19:29.474
Aye !

01:19:29.558 --> 01:19:33.186
Somebody should be
taking notes about this.

01:19:33.979 --> 01:19:35.147
How about Pavitch?

01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:37.107
There's a rumor he can write.

01:19:38.525 --> 01:19:40.402
Pavitch, take note.

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:44.698
This coffee tastes like
Zaranska washed his feet in it.

01:19:46.324 --> 01:19:50.078
Only you would know,
you old sock-sucker.

01:19:50.162 --> 01:19:52.539
This is a waste of time.

01:19:52.664 --> 01:19:54.624
Why don't you resign?

01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:59.754
We can find a replacement
for you fast.

01:20:09.639 --> 01:20:10.932
Yeah!

01:20:20.233 --> 01:20:23.320
I think living facilities
are important.

01:20:23.403 --> 01:20:25.489
Toilets, beds,
and such like.

01:20:25.572 --> 01:20:28.992
I think we ought to start there.

01:20:29.075 --> 01:20:32.037
Can we get a contractor here

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.164
to redo the toilets?

01:20:43.924 --> 01:20:45.842
Can I see the warden?

01:20:45.926 --> 01:20:47.844
The council is in session

01:20:47.928 --> 01:20:50.680
and these men got
appointments afterwards.

01:20:50.764 --> 01:20:54.601
Mr. Brubaker has
a prison board meeting tonight

01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:56.937
he got to be at.

01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:59.981
But I want to see him.

01:21:00.065 --> 01:21:03.318
If a trusty escapes,

01:21:03.401 --> 01:21:05.445
he can't be a trusty.

01:21:05.529 --> 01:21:08.114
Damn straight.

01:21:08.198 --> 01:21:11.493
But I'm talking about
extenuating circumstances.

01:21:11.576 --> 01:21:15.288
For instance, a man escapes,
realizes his mistake,

01:21:15.372 --> 01:21:17.374
then surrenders himself voluntarily.

01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:20.544
Put him in the hole for 10 days.

01:21:20.627 --> 01:21:24.005
Take away all
his visiting privileges.

01:21:24.089 --> 01:21:26.591
What the fuck you talking about?

01:21:26.675 --> 01:21:29.844
Don't let him mail more
than one letter a week.

01:21:29.928 --> 01:21:33.682
Don't let him watch TV
for a whole damn week.

01:21:33.765 --> 01:21:37.811
Birdwell, you got strange ideas
of criminal justice.

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:40.897
Up your ass, I believe.

01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:43.858
Want to know something,
Zaranska?

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:46.945
Sure, I'd love to know something.

01:21:47.028 --> 01:21:48.363
About your mama?

01:21:50.657 --> 01:21:51.908
Hey! Hey!

01:21:53.827 --> 01:21:55.161
Come on, Abraham.

01:21:55.245 --> 01:21:57.163
Let's go.

01:21:57.247 --> 01:21:59.207
Hands off him, Purcell!

01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:02.043
I got to clean my conscience.

01:22:02.127 --> 01:22:06.256
I got something
to tell you about in private.

01:22:06.339 --> 01:22:09.551
You don't have
to explain anything to anybody.

01:22:09.634 --> 01:22:11.845
Come into my office.

01:22:12.012 --> 01:22:14.514
I got guys waiting,
that have appointments.

01:22:14.723 --> 01:22:18.810
Tell them a story.
You guys can manage.

01:22:22.856 --> 01:22:27.193
I come to Wakefield
before World War ll.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.820
Take a walk, Purcell.

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:32.616
This ain't open to the public.

01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:37.287
Yeah.

01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:40.707
We used to make
corn liquor out of this.

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:43.668
Growed it at Campfire Field.

01:22:46.004 --> 01:22:47.339
(HUMMING)

01:22:49.799 --> 01:22:51.217
What happened?

01:22:53.428 --> 01:22:55.263
What happened to your eye?

01:22:55.347 --> 01:22:56.765
Got hit.

01:22:56.848 --> 01:22:58.892
With what?

01:22:59.184 --> 01:23:03.313
With a baseball bat and chain

01:23:03.396 --> 01:23:06.232
and a rope with knots in it.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.751
You're doing time for manslaughter?

01:23:24.834 --> 01:23:25.919
Yes.

01:23:26.002 --> 01:23:28.922
For killing my brother with a rock.

01:23:30.006 --> 01:23:31.049
How much time?

01:23:34.511 --> 01:23:36.930
How much time?

01:23:37.681 --> 01:23:39.265
35 year.

01:23:40.266 --> 01:23:42.185
How long have you been here?

01:23:44.896 --> 01:23:46.356
Hell, I don't know.

01:23:46.439 --> 01:23:47.857
Well, I do.

01:23:47.941 --> 01:23:50.652
38 years, 6 months,

01:23:50.735 --> 01:23:52.570
according to this.

01:23:57.367 --> 01:23:58.618
(INTERCOM BUZZES)

01:24:00.954 --> 01:24:02.414
Yeah.

01:24:02.497 --> 01:24:04.958
<i>Your doctor is standing out here.</i>

01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:07.752
Tell him just a minute.

01:24:07.836 --> 01:24:10.046
There was lots of guys.

01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:13.675
The yardman say,
"Abraham, chop them up,

01:24:13.758 --> 01:24:17.303
"and take them for a walk
down in them shadows."

01:24:18.471 --> 01:24:19.556
What?

01:24:19.639 --> 01:24:22.767
I give Jake the clothes
to the laundry.

01:24:24.018 --> 01:24:27.230
I stuck them close at the fence,

01:24:27.313 --> 01:24:30.984
where all them other
boys are buried.

01:24:32.819 --> 01:24:35.780
Must be over 200 of them
out there now.

01:24:35.864 --> 01:24:39.242
You mean the bodies

01:24:39.325 --> 01:24:41.536
that are supposed to be
buried on this farm?

01:24:41.661 --> 01:24:43.621
Yes.

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.081
Where?

01:24:45.498 --> 01:24:47.375
There's 15,000 acres out there.

01:24:47.584 --> 01:24:50.378
I know exactly where they lay.

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:54.090
Campfire pasture.

01:24:54.174 --> 01:24:55.216
How?

01:24:56.468 --> 01:24:58.511
Abraham, how do you know?

01:24:59.763 --> 01:25:02.223
I was the coffin maker.

01:25:03.808 --> 01:25:07.103
Mr. Brubaker, this is Dr. Campbell.

01:25:07.187 --> 01:25:08.438
Yeah.

01:25:08.521 --> 01:25:12.484
Will you show me
exactly where tomorrow morning?

01:25:12.567 --> 01:25:14.319
Yes, sir.

01:25:18.114 --> 01:25:20.909
That board meeting
ought to end around 10:00.

01:25:20.992 --> 01:25:23.077
I should be home around midnight.

01:25:23.161 --> 01:25:25.079
We'll hold the fort.

01:25:25.163 --> 01:25:28.041
I need five guys
with shovels after breakfast.

01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:29.918
You got 'em, coach.

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:33.379
What about Abraham?

01:25:33.546 --> 01:25:36.341
I'm going to get him
released as soon...

01:25:36.424 --> 01:25:38.885
Why you want to do that?

01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:40.678
Do what?

01:25:42.555 --> 01:25:44.724
Why don't you leave him be?

01:25:44.808 --> 01:25:46.351
All he knows is this place.

01:25:46.434 --> 01:25:49.729
You knew he was
here this long, didn't you?

01:25:49.813 --> 01:25:51.981
He's not bothering nobody.

01:25:52.065 --> 01:25:55.401
You can't hide in prison forever.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.241
Stir up some hell, Henry.

01:26:14.712 --> 01:26:16.965
How you doing, Abraham?

01:26:17.048 --> 01:26:18.967
You got an appointment.

01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:20.802
What?

01:26:20.885 --> 01:26:22.470
Little business.

01:26:22.554 --> 01:26:24.639
Where we going?

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.437
Doc wants to see you, Abe.

01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:34.315
I ain't sick.

01:26:47.287 --> 01:26:49.038
Hello, Abe.

01:26:53.585 --> 01:26:57.171
Abe, we got some questions
that have to be answered.

01:26:57.255 --> 01:26:59.883
Then you can get some sleep.

01:26:59.966 --> 01:27:01.885
Eddie, get that stuff.

01:27:16.316 --> 01:27:18.526
What are you goin' to do?

01:27:20.737 --> 01:27:22.071
Ahh!

01:27:25.033 --> 01:27:31.247
Captain Brubaker has been out
of the mainstream too long.

01:27:31.331 --> 01:27:34.375
There are 13 states,
including mine,

01:27:34.459 --> 01:27:39.964
that still rely on a strap
to control the convicts.

01:27:40.048 --> 01:27:43.843
Because others do it
doesn't make it right.

01:27:43.927 --> 01:27:45.762
The hell it doesn't.

01:27:45.845 --> 01:27:50.308
It's better than time lost
sitting in the hole.

01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:55.104
It's a simple fact that
crop production at Wakefield

01:27:55.188 --> 01:27:59.108
is down nearly 40%
this last quarter since...

01:27:59.192 --> 01:28:01.486
But revenues are up 20%.

01:28:01.569 --> 01:28:05.114
Give me a year.
Leave us alone.

01:28:05.198 --> 01:28:08.910
We'll eat what we grow,
sell the rest,

01:28:08.993 --> 01:28:12.622
I'll have a cash surplus
in a year.

01:28:12.705 --> 01:28:16.000
Give us some warning

01:28:16.084 --> 01:28:18.670
when you go doubling
the price of corn...

01:28:18.753 --> 01:28:20.964
You cancel an old contract

01:28:21.047 --> 01:28:23.967
with a customer like
C.P. Woodward Lumber.

01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:27.095
He used prisoners
for slave labor.

01:28:27.178 --> 01:28:30.056
As far as corn goes,
we're still below fair market.

01:28:30.139 --> 01:28:33.101
How much cash surplus
you talking about?

01:28:34.143 --> 01:28:36.771
In farm accounting alone,

01:28:36.854 --> 01:28:38.147
150,000.

01:28:38.231 --> 01:28:39.315
Dollars?

01:28:39.399 --> 01:28:40.817
Yes, sir.

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:42.318
Good Lord.

01:28:42.402 --> 01:28:46.030
We'll need some Wall Street types

01:28:46.114 --> 01:28:47.907
to help manage it.

01:28:49.075 --> 01:28:51.494
I'd like to put it
back into the facility.

01:28:51.577 --> 01:28:54.622
The place is literally
falling apart.

01:28:54.706 --> 01:28:57.583
You've got dry rot,
disease, rats

01:28:57.667 --> 01:29:01.129
and a boiler that your own
state inspectors

01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:03.047
condemned six years ago.

01:29:03.131 --> 01:29:05.174
We authorized a new boiler.

01:29:05.258 --> 01:29:08.302
Why didn't purchasing
take my calls?

01:29:08.386 --> 01:29:11.180
Brubaker, I'm looking into that.

01:29:11.264 --> 01:29:15.393
Let's look
at your firing a state employee

01:29:15.476 --> 01:29:17.854
who was bookkeeper for years.

01:29:17.937 --> 01:29:20.106
Because he wasn't worth...

01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:24.277
You're letting inmates
with fourth-grade educations take over.

01:29:25.278 --> 01:29:27.697
They don't all have
fourth-grade educations.

01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:31.200
You're telling me
that's going to work?

01:29:31.284 --> 01:29:34.704
These men have to
take responsibility.

01:29:34.787 --> 01:29:37.123
They'll change
this place, not me.

01:29:37.206 --> 01:29:38.833
What the hell
are we paying you for?

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.712
The bottom line

01:29:42.795 --> 01:29:48.051
is that you want to make life
real easy for those men.

01:29:48.134 --> 01:29:50.261
No. Not at all.

01:29:50.344 --> 01:29:54.182
I think you like men like that

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.226
because they're reckless,
same as you.

01:29:57.310 --> 01:30:00.188
They see something
they don't like,

01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:03.232
they shoot it up,
burn it down,

01:30:03.316 --> 01:30:05.651
make up their own laws.

01:30:05.985 --> 01:30:08.029
Sir, those are your laws.

01:30:08.112 --> 01:30:10.406
They've held up our businesses.

01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:14.410
They've raped our daughters
and murdered our sons.

01:30:14.494 --> 01:30:16.913
So we make them
wards of the state.

01:30:16.996 --> 01:30:21.459
We accept the responsibility
to feed and clothe them,

01:30:22.335 --> 01:30:26.255
not to starve them,
not to torture them.

01:30:26.339 --> 01:30:29.759
Change the laws
that you don't like.

01:30:29.842 --> 01:30:31.928
It's my job...

01:30:32.011 --> 01:30:34.639
To listen to those who pay you.

01:30:34.722 --> 01:30:37.100
It is my job to reform a prison

01:30:37.183 --> 01:30:40.728
not work for political parties.

01:30:40.895 --> 01:30:42.897
May I butt in a second?

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:44.607
Let the record show

01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:47.610
that State Senator Hite
is speaking.

01:30:47.693 --> 01:30:51.155
Mr. Brubaker, face the facts.

01:30:51.531 --> 01:30:55.701
The people in this state
have problems getting jobs,

01:30:55.785 --> 01:30:59.372
paying rent, insurance premiums.

01:30:59.455 --> 01:31:01.624
Now come election time,

01:31:01.707 --> 01:31:04.627
they might vote for
your prison reform thing

01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:08.214
but that's just a reflex.

01:31:08.381 --> 01:31:11.342
They don't really want to hear
their taxes are being raised

01:31:11.425 --> 01:31:14.637
to take care of
murderers and rapists.

01:31:16.055 --> 01:31:19.392
That farm wasn't
costing anybody anything

01:31:19.475 --> 01:31:22.603
before you got your hands on it.

01:31:22.687 --> 01:31:24.564
Follow what I'm saying?

01:31:25.148 --> 01:31:27.400
Let's build them a putting green,

01:31:27.483 --> 01:31:31.404
a clubhouse,
or a miniature golf course,

01:31:31.487 --> 01:31:33.573
a hot, bubbly bath?

01:31:33.656 --> 01:31:37.160
How about a roof
that won't cave in?

01:31:37.243 --> 01:31:38.411
That's enough.

01:31:38.494 --> 01:31:41.330
An insured roof this time.

01:31:41.414 --> 01:31:42.415
What?

01:31:42.498 --> 01:31:45.585
The collapsed roof
isn't covered at all,

01:31:45.668 --> 01:31:48.754
but we do have coverage
for threshing machines,

01:31:48.838 --> 01:31:50.882
balers, a tractor.

01:31:50.965 --> 01:31:53.384
Sounds sensible to me.

01:31:53.551 --> 01:31:56.137
I approved those policies
personally.

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.015
Your company sold us the policies

01:31:59.098 --> 01:32:01.726
but that equipment
doesn't exist!

01:32:03.686 --> 01:32:06.022
What you have got, Mr. Brubaker,

01:32:06.397 --> 01:32:08.524
is a poor attitude.

01:32:08.608 --> 01:32:11.235
I don't like you,
but that's beside the point.

01:32:11.319 --> 01:32:13.154
No, it's not.

01:32:13.237 --> 01:32:17.241
I'm telling you this
as a favor to Lillian Gray,

01:32:17.325 --> 01:32:20.661
who, for some reason,
believes in you.

01:32:20.745 --> 01:32:25.666
Do not come marching in here

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:27.919
from wherever the hell
she found you

01:32:28.002 --> 01:32:32.048
lecturing us about how
to treat our fellow man.

01:32:32.131 --> 01:32:34.717
We're here for free,
except you.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.345
We could be
other places.

01:32:37.428 --> 01:32:39.222
So could I.

01:32:39.305 --> 01:32:43.309
We all better eat
and calm down.

01:32:57.782 --> 01:32:59.283
Brubaker!

01:32:59.367 --> 01:33:02.286
How long do you think you'll last

01:33:02.370 --> 01:33:04.413
pulling stunts like this?

01:33:04.497 --> 01:33:06.832
I'm sorry I don't have

01:33:06.916 --> 01:33:09.418
the right answers for you.

01:33:09.502 --> 01:33:11.379
Then make some up.

01:33:11.462 --> 01:33:15.174
They will pull the plug on this.

01:33:15.549 --> 01:33:18.094
If you're not in the system,
you can't change it.

01:33:18.177 --> 01:33:22.515
Let them think
they control you.

01:33:22.598 --> 01:33:25.518
The real obstacles to prison reform

01:33:25.768 --> 01:33:28.688
aren't John Deach
or Senator Whatever.

01:33:28.771 --> 01:33:30.189
Hite.

01:33:30.273 --> 01:33:32.692
It's people that just want

01:33:32.775 --> 01:33:35.194
to say the right thing

01:33:35.278 --> 01:33:37.697
and get nothing done.

01:33:39.115 --> 01:33:40.783
Everything you do is right.

01:33:40.866 --> 01:33:43.286
Everything everybody else
does is absurd.

01:33:43.369 --> 01:33:46.956
I don't know
what's right or wrong.

01:33:47.373 --> 01:33:49.792
I'm interested
in what works.

01:33:50.293 --> 01:33:52.336
There's no way
to beat those guys.

01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:58.217
You can't toe the line.
It keeps changing.

01:33:58.843 --> 01:34:02.638
I've locked the goddamn
keys in the car.

01:34:02.722 --> 01:34:03.848
Jeez!

01:34:06.434 --> 01:34:08.019
God!

01:34:17.194 --> 01:34:19.655
These prisoners are realizing

01:34:19.739 --> 01:34:23.159
they don't have to take everything
that's shoved at them

01:34:23.242 --> 01:34:25.244
because they're human beings.

01:34:26.037 --> 01:34:27.913
Maybe when they get out

01:34:27.997 --> 01:34:30.875
they won't rape Deach's daughter.

01:34:31.751 --> 01:34:34.086
Bravo, but you're full of shit.

01:34:34.462 --> 01:34:39.008
It's not enough to make things
work inside that prison.

01:34:39.091 --> 01:34:41.010
Out here they don't want

01:34:41.093 --> 01:34:43.304
to hear you or see me.

01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:47.224
Why do you spend day after day

01:34:47.308 --> 01:34:49.518
with people like that

01:34:49.602 --> 01:34:52.063
and let them make
a fool out of you?

01:34:53.272 --> 01:34:56.067
Because sometimes
you don't lose.

01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.486
If you can't figure out

01:34:58.569 --> 01:35:00.488
how to play these people

01:35:00.571 --> 01:35:01.947
you'll self-destruct

01:35:02.031 --> 01:35:04.825
and then you'll be of no use to me.

01:37:56.664 --> 01:37:58.791
Turn on the lights.

01:38:15.182 --> 01:38:17.768
Just got the call
from the tower.

01:38:17.851 --> 01:38:20.729
Find out why the man
in Tower One

01:38:20.813 --> 01:38:23.440
didn't report anything.

01:38:23.524 --> 01:38:25.651
These guys at night, they...

01:38:26.402 --> 01:38:27.820
Find out!

01:38:53.512 --> 01:38:55.639
You had to listen to him, huh?

01:38:55.764 --> 01:38:57.558
What?

01:38:58.183 --> 01:38:59.351
"What?"

01:39:00.352 --> 01:39:03.731
I don't believe men like you.

01:39:04.064 --> 01:39:07.735
You start wars
and let others fight them.

01:39:08.319 --> 01:39:12.114
You talk about
do this, do that!

01:39:12.239 --> 01:39:14.491
You say,
"follow me around.

01:39:14.575 --> 01:39:17.578
"I've got it figured out.

01:39:17.661 --> 01:39:19.830
"We can make things better."

01:39:19.913 --> 01:39:21.498
That's a lot of bullshit!

01:39:21.582 --> 01:39:25.294
All you do is
get people killed!

01:39:30.341 --> 01:39:32.509
Maybe you're right.

01:39:52.655 --> 01:39:55.157
Don't go in there now.

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:56.533
Yeah, but I...

01:39:56.617 --> 01:39:58.202
Not now.

01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:30.294
Warden!

01:41:30.377 --> 01:41:34.298
There's a Lillian Gray
on the phone.

01:41:34.381 --> 01:41:37.092
She's saying it's urgent.

01:42:12.044 --> 01:42:13.921
I'm through talking.

01:42:16.924 --> 01:42:19.468
How did you find out
about this so fast?

01:42:19.551 --> 01:42:22.846
Nothing happens there
that doesn't get out.

01:42:22.930 --> 01:42:24.807
Now you're sounding paranoid.

01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:26.308
<i>I'm not paranoid.</i>

01:42:26.391 --> 01:42:28.310
<i>The enemy is real.</i>

01:42:30.938 --> 01:42:32.981
All right, you know
the fairgrounds,

01:42:33.065 --> 01:42:35.734
the auction house
where we sell cattle?

01:42:35.818 --> 01:42:37.528
What time
in the morning?

01:42:37.611 --> 01:42:39.780
8:00. I'll meet... No!

01:42:40.113 --> 01:42:42.032
Make that earlier, 7:00.

01:42:42.115 --> 01:42:43.784
I'll see you.

01:43:14.273 --> 01:43:16.191
I said alone.

01:43:16.275 --> 01:43:19.194
He's a friend.

01:43:19.278 --> 01:43:22.197
Have you found anything yet?

01:43:22.281 --> 01:43:23.407
No.

01:43:23.490 --> 01:43:25.826
It's still having its effect.

01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:47.764
You called him?

01:43:47.848 --> 01:43:50.475
He called Lillian
last night himself.

01:44:01.445 --> 01:44:05.490
Let me put this
as simply as I can.

01:44:05.574 --> 01:44:07.200
Stop digging-

01:44:07.868 --> 01:44:09.077
Why?

01:44:09.161 --> 01:44:10.913
Because you're paid to run

01:44:10.996 --> 01:44:14.333
one of this country's
best-conceived prisons.

01:44:15.751 --> 01:44:18.587
Because although
Wakefield is admittedly

01:44:18.670 --> 01:44:21.465
an imperfect institution,
much like America herself,

01:44:21.548 --> 01:44:24.843
she is nonetheless
a grand experiment.

01:44:24.927 --> 01:44:28.013
Government of the man,
for the man,

01:44:28.096 --> 01:44:30.098
by the man.

01:44:30.182 --> 01:44:32.893
And it's the only prison

01:44:32.976 --> 01:44:34.895
that's shown a profit.

01:44:36.188 --> 01:44:37.856
What is this?

01:44:37.981 --> 01:44:42.361
I think the senator is exhibiting
uncommon foresight.

01:44:44.738 --> 01:44:47.115
We'll try and salvage
something here today.

01:44:47.199 --> 01:44:50.744
We'll work with you,
Mr. Brubaker,

01:44:50.827 --> 01:44:51.995
release funds.

01:44:52.079 --> 01:44:53.997
You can hire people,

01:44:54.081 --> 01:44:56.875
get you that boiler.

01:44:56.959 --> 01:44:58.210
Yep.

01:44:58.293 --> 01:45:01.004
Draw up plans
for more barracks.

01:45:01.964 --> 01:45:03.966
Get yourself a couple
of new tractors.

01:45:04.049 --> 01:45:08.261
How many men
are buried out there?

01:45:09.721 --> 01:45:12.307
That field was an old
paupers' graveyard,

01:45:12.391 --> 01:45:14.643
when my granddaddy
was alive.

01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:16.895
It's in the records.

01:45:16.979 --> 01:45:18.313
I'm talking about murder.

01:45:19.481 --> 01:45:21.775
It's time to cut the bull.

01:45:21.858 --> 01:45:24.778
Grave robbery is a felony
in this state.

01:45:25.487 --> 01:45:27.614
You want to wind up
in your prison,

01:45:27.698 --> 01:45:29.282
Mr. Brubaker?

01:45:32.744 --> 01:45:34.454
He means it.

01:45:34.538 --> 01:45:36.498
I'm calling the governor.

01:45:36.581 --> 01:45:39.334
The governor already knows.

01:45:48.885 --> 01:45:52.681
Nobody's asking you
to stop digging.

01:45:52.764 --> 01:45:54.474
We're ordering you to.

01:45:54.599 --> 01:45:56.852
I don't like being
put in a corner.

01:45:56.935 --> 01:45:58.937
Edwards, stay out of this.

01:45:59.021 --> 01:46:00.981
You're another token liberal

01:46:01.064 --> 01:46:02.941
that doesn't know shit.

01:46:03.025 --> 01:46:04.943
I'll reform Wakefield,

01:46:05.027 --> 01:46:08.447
if it means putting the prison board
behind bars.

01:46:08.530 --> 01:46:10.782
I've been behind bars, Brubaker.

01:46:11.491 --> 01:46:13.618
Two years in Atlanta for real,

01:46:13.702 --> 01:46:16.621
not a few days in disguise.

01:46:16.705 --> 01:46:20.167
So you listen
to this token liberal.

01:46:20.250 --> 01:46:22.794
You got a high opinion
of yourself.

01:46:24.087 --> 01:46:26.048
Most of it I agree with.

01:46:26.131 --> 01:46:29.843
You don't understand
inmate mentality.

01:46:29.926 --> 01:46:31.887
If you did, you'd know,

01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:36.391
that asshole's ready to offer you
anything you need for those men.

01:46:36.975 --> 01:46:38.727
It's not enough.

01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:41.897
Henry, stop the digging-

01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:44.524
Concentrate on the men
who are alive.

01:46:44.608 --> 01:46:47.110
We have leverage now.

01:46:47.486 --> 01:46:49.446
I've got a prison to run.

01:46:49.529 --> 01:46:51.156
I hope so.

01:48:36.261 --> 01:48:37.345
Bullen!

01:48:37.429 --> 01:48:40.265
Come over here
and bring some guys.

01:48:40.348 --> 01:48:42.184
Zaranska, Elwood.

01:48:42.267 --> 01:48:44.811
Start digging here.

01:49:08.001 --> 01:49:09.961
Hey, Brubaker!

01:49:10.045 --> 01:49:12.964
I believe we got us one.

01:49:19.304 --> 01:49:21.932
I got one over here.

01:49:25.227 --> 01:49:26.394
Hold it.

01:49:26.478 --> 01:49:27.938
Hold it. Careful.

01:49:28.021 --> 01:49:30.774
Okay, careful.

01:49:30.857 --> 01:49:32.442
Just scoop it out.

01:49:32.525 --> 01:49:33.860
Easy,huh?

01:49:33.944 --> 01:49:36.863
Spoon it out if you have to.

01:49:36.947 --> 01:49:38.865
Got one here, boss!

01:49:38.949 --> 01:49:40.909
Easy!

01:49:42.452 --> 01:49:44.913
Carefully pry this off.

01:49:44.996 --> 01:49:47.540
Don't touch anything
you find inside.

01:49:51.461 --> 01:49:53.546
Don't touch anything inside.

01:49:55.966 --> 01:49:57.384
Zaranska.

01:49:57.467 --> 01:49:59.886
I can't get it out.

01:49:59.970 --> 01:50:02.889
Every time I move it, it cracks.

01:50:02.973 --> 01:50:06.643
Careful, careful.
Don't touch it.

01:50:11.022 --> 01:50:12.399
(THUNDER)

01:50:22.826 --> 01:50:26.413
The whole goddamn place
has gone crazy.

01:50:26.496 --> 01:50:31.209
They're digging up men
dead 30 years.

01:50:32.544 --> 01:50:35.297
That's because the man
took away the reason to be smart

01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:37.340
and have some self-respect.

01:50:37.882 --> 01:50:40.510
Turning the whole
damn place upside down.

01:50:40.593 --> 01:50:42.012
Prison board
will stop him.

01:50:42.971 --> 01:50:45.348
Bullshit, Floyd!

01:50:45.432 --> 01:50:48.393
They already tried to buy him.

01:50:49.144 --> 01:50:52.230
So, what do we do?

01:50:55.025 --> 01:50:57.736
What about it, Dicky?

01:50:57.861 --> 01:50:59.821
You got the man's ear.

01:50:59.904 --> 01:51:01.948
Does he want to
wake up dead?

01:51:02.032 --> 01:51:04.075
There's talk around here!

01:51:06.161 --> 01:51:09.080
You're the only one doing
all the talking, Huey.

01:51:14.544 --> 01:51:15.837
Yeah, that's great.

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:18.506
All because one old fool

01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:21.885
starts running off
at the mouth.

01:51:53.583 --> 01:51:54.709
Uh...

01:51:57.087 --> 01:51:59.964
Eddie, come here.

01:52:04.969 --> 01:52:07.055
It's time to go.

01:52:07.138 --> 01:52:08.556
It's time to check out.

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:10.058
Why?

01:52:10.141 --> 01:52:12.811
What do you mean?

01:52:13.061 --> 01:52:14.979
It's too loose.

01:52:15.063 --> 01:52:16.481
It's crazy.

01:52:16.564 --> 01:52:19.526
They're digging up bodies.

01:52:19.901 --> 01:52:22.570
Too many people got the answer.

01:52:23.363 --> 01:52:25.907
Well, I figure
I'm going to stick around,

01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:29.285
take my chances here.

01:52:44.134 --> 01:52:46.094
Skull under the arm.

01:52:46.177 --> 01:52:49.889
Both lower leg bones
severed from the thighs.

01:52:49.973 --> 01:52:53.351
Why were the legs cut off?

01:52:53.435 --> 01:52:56.813
It's easier to shorten the man
than to lengthen the box.

01:52:56.896 --> 01:52:58.773
How old are these?

01:52:58.857 --> 01:53:02.026
I'm not a pathologist.

01:53:02.110 --> 01:53:05.405
I need causes of death.

01:53:05.488 --> 01:53:08.616
If I took them to the state hospital.

01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:10.326
Tell the TV stations

01:53:10.410 --> 01:53:13.955
we found four murdered bodies.

01:53:14.038 --> 01:53:15.457
There's probably more.

01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:17.125
You'll start a stampede.

01:53:17.208 --> 01:53:18.293
Exactly.

01:53:21.713 --> 01:53:23.631
Mr. Brubaker!

01:53:23.715 --> 01:53:26.634
We got a runaway vehicle.

01:53:26.718 --> 01:53:28.219
Huey is in it.

01:53:28.344 --> 01:53:29.637
- Huey?
- Yes, sir.

01:53:29.721 --> 01:53:30.805
Why?

01:53:31.556 --> 01:53:33.433
He killed Abraham.

01:53:41.065 --> 01:53:44.194
Where would he be?
Where would he go?

01:53:44.277 --> 01:53:45.570
Pinky's.

01:53:45.653 --> 01:53:47.822
Maybe.

01:53:54.078 --> 01:53:57.165
Alive. I want him alive.

01:54:21.606 --> 01:54:23.107
Try over there.

01:54:44.128 --> 01:54:47.507
I ain't open for business yet.

01:54:56.182 --> 01:54:58.726
Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

01:54:58.810 --> 01:55:00.728
You guys crazy?

01:55:02.647 --> 01:55:04.566
Who are the sandwiches for?

01:55:04.649 --> 01:55:06.317
Nobody.

01:55:08.653 --> 01:55:10.113
Where's Huey Rauch?

01:55:10.196 --> 01:55:11.281
Who?

01:55:11.364 --> 01:55:12.949
Where's your sister, Pinky?

01:55:13.032 --> 01:55:14.826
What, Carol?

01:55:17.370 --> 01:55:18.955
What's behind that door?

01:55:19.038 --> 01:55:20.623
- My house.
- Open it.

01:55:21.332 --> 01:55:24.085
The door's locked.

01:55:25.628 --> 01:55:27.297
I'll go round front.

01:55:28.381 --> 01:55:30.258
Hey, this is my castle!

01:55:30.341 --> 01:55:32.135
I'm calling the law.

01:55:32.218 --> 01:55:34.512
Then call them.

01:55:34.596 --> 01:55:36.514
For now, shut up.

01:57:14.153 --> 01:57:15.321
Hold it!

01:57:38.469 --> 01:57:42.390
He's dead. He's dead.

01:58:03.828 --> 01:58:08.291
...examined all the remains
in a laboratory?

01:58:08.374 --> 01:58:10.460
Yes.

01:58:10.543 --> 01:58:13.421
What about
these broken bones?

01:58:13.588 --> 01:58:16.257
They may be due
to a blunt trauma

01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:20.762
but those fractures could
have occurred after death

01:58:20.845 --> 01:58:24.515
as a result of a cave-in.

01:58:46.537 --> 01:58:49.874
You don't need
20 years of practice

01:58:49.957 --> 01:58:52.960
to recognize
a skull violently crushed.

01:58:53.085 --> 01:58:54.170
Son,

01:58:54.253 --> 01:58:56.923
I have the forensic report

01:58:57.006 --> 01:58:59.467
sitting in front of me.

01:58:59.550 --> 01:59:02.303
According to all
my scientific friends,

01:59:02.386 --> 01:59:06.849
it's just not all that clear
on that point.

01:59:06.933 --> 01:59:09.852
You've got some indigent inmates

01:59:09.936 --> 01:59:12.271
buried in an old paupers' graveyard.

01:59:12.355 --> 01:59:16.108
Anything else, I think,
is pure speculation.

01:59:16.192 --> 01:59:19.946
Do paupers die
in pieces, Dr. Gregory?

01:59:20.029 --> 01:59:23.616
Mr. Partridge, this board
is quite capable

01:59:23.699 --> 01:59:25.993
of questioning its witnesses

01:59:26.077 --> 01:59:28.913
and this whole procedure...

01:59:28.996 --> 01:59:31.916
This whole procedure
could have been

01:59:31.999 --> 01:59:33.835
a closed hearing.

01:59:33.918 --> 01:59:37.505
It would be
in everyone's best interest

01:59:37.588 --> 01:59:41.592
if we got Mr. Brubaker's
thoughts on his firing.

01:59:41.676 --> 01:59:45.596
Our primary responsibility
at this point in time

01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:48.349
is the Christian reinterment

01:59:48.432 --> 01:59:50.434
of the remains

01:59:50.518 --> 01:59:53.938
and to regain the control
over this institution

01:59:54.021 --> 01:59:55.898
that our warden relinquished.

01:59:55.982 --> 01:59:59.652
We don't have any more gunfights
in our streets.

01:59:59.735 --> 02:00:05.491
Any comment on what your thoughts
might be on priority?

02:00:07.368 --> 02:00:09.287
Priority?

02:00:11.414 --> 02:00:13.082
I tried to reach
the governor on that

02:00:13.165 --> 02:00:15.585
and give him
my thoughts

02:00:15.668 --> 02:00:19.088
but we all know
how busy he is.

02:00:19.171 --> 02:00:21.591
The board can handle this.

02:00:21.674 --> 02:00:24.093
I was going to suggest

02:00:24.176 --> 02:00:27.889
the best way to prevent
trouble, confusion

02:00:29.015 --> 02:00:31.100
or a waste of
the taxpayers' money

02:00:31.183 --> 02:00:35.980
would be to shoot prisoners
sentenced to Wakefield.

02:00:36.063 --> 02:00:37.773
All right, that's enough!

02:00:37.857 --> 02:00:41.110
You answer to
those remarks, mister!

02:00:42.153 --> 02:00:44.280
Miss Gray can explain them.

02:00:44.363 --> 02:00:46.991
I believe you speak
the same language.

02:00:53.331 --> 02:00:56.167
You want me
to bring him back?

02:00:56.250 --> 02:00:58.669
Nobody touches him.

02:01:17.355 --> 02:01:20.274
I figured I hadn't
heard the last from you.

02:01:20.358 --> 02:01:23.527
Why do you think
you can walk out?

02:01:23.611 --> 02:01:25.279
That's murder
they're talking about.

02:01:25.363 --> 02:01:27.281
If they condone it,

02:01:27.365 --> 02:01:32.119
you can't tell these men
why they're locked up.

02:01:33.245 --> 02:01:35.873
You don't see any options,
no middle ground?

02:01:35.957 --> 02:01:39.043
I don't play politics
with the truth.

02:01:40.294 --> 02:01:41.963
No way to compromise?

02:01:42.046 --> 02:01:44.882
Oh, on strategy, maybe,

02:01:45.007 --> 02:01:46.467
but not on principle.

02:01:47.385 --> 02:01:51.347
Goddamn it,
I agree with you!

02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:53.182
No, you don't.

02:01:53.265 --> 02:01:55.518
Not really.

02:02:08.739 --> 02:02:13.452
MAN: <i>The business
of this prison is farming,</i>

02:02:13.536 --> 02:02:18.040
<i>not digging up pasture
looking for old graveyards.</i>

02:02:18.749 --> 02:02:21.168
<i>What's done is done.</i>

02:02:21.252 --> 02:02:25.089
<i>We got ourselves
plenty to think about today.</i>

02:02:25.172 --> 02:02:28.259
<i>Never mind
dwelling about yesterday.</i>

02:02:30.344 --> 02:02:34.682
<i>We all got to get back
to the basics at hand.</i>

02:02:34.765 --> 02:02:38.602
<i>That's why
I'm standing up here,</i>

02:02:38.728 --> 02:02:41.272
<i>saying to you convicts
straight out,</i>

02:02:41.355 --> 02:02:44.984
<i>how Rory Poke is going to
run this here prison.</i>

02:02:45.067 --> 02:02:47.486
<i>We won't be
wasting any more time,</i>

02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:49.613
<i>misunderstanding each other.</i>

02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:56.954
<i>I am a firm believer in discipline.</i>

02:02:58.622 --> 02:03:01.042
<i>If a convict does his share of work,</i>

02:03:01.125 --> 02:03:05.463
<i>he's not going to have anything
to worry about.</i>

02:03:05.546 --> 02:03:10.217
<i>That ain't been happening
around here lately.</i>

02:03:10.301 --> 02:03:12.803
<i>And there ain't no crop</i>

02:03:13.971 --> 02:03:19.310
<i>in no field at no prison
that I'm in charge of</i>

02:03:19.977 --> 02:03:21.896
<i>that's going to die
in the fields.</i>

02:03:23.147 --> 02:03:26.817
<i>The trusties will divide you
into work groups.</i>

02:03:28.069 --> 02:03:30.196
<i>You listen, now.</i>

02:03:30.279 --> 02:03:32.907
<i>You give them any trouble,</i>

02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:35.284
<i>and they've got my permission</i>

02:03:35.367 --> 02:03:39.121
<i>to punish the troublemaker hard,</i>

02:03:39.205 --> 02:03:41.916
<i>fair, but hard.</i>

02:03:42.041 --> 02:03:44.752
I packed up
your personal things.

02:03:44.835 --> 02:03:49.590
If you get any mail,
I'll take care of it.

02:03:49.673 --> 02:03:51.592
Don't worry.

02:03:55.513 --> 02:03:57.556
Hey, Brubaker.

02:04:00.142 --> 02:04:02.978
I'm getting ready
to tell you something.

02:04:04.188 --> 02:04:08.943
POKE: <i>All of you here,
every damn one of you,</i>

02:04:09.026 --> 02:04:11.904
<i>will receive equal justice...</i>

02:04:12.655 --> 02:04:14.073
You were right.

02:04:14.615 --> 02:04:19.078
<i>POKE: I don't believe
in making no specials,</i>

02:04:19.161 --> 02:04:23.582
<i>having some convicts looking
more important than others.</i>

02:04:23.666 --> 02:04:29.296
<i>Trusties are the only men
that deserve.</i>

02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:34.135
<i>That's what
you're going to discover</i>

02:04:34.218 --> 02:04:38.013
<i>Rory Poke is all about.</i>

02:04:38.097 --> 02:04:42.434
<i>There ain't gonna be
no more warden</i>

02:04:42.518 --> 02:04:45.437

02:05:00.411 --> 02:05:02.538

02:05:05.499 --> 02:05:08.335
<i>You men, get back into line!</i>

02:05:08.419 --> 02:05:11.213
<i>You'll get a taste of the strap!</i>

02:05:15.593 --> 02:05:18.012
(MEN CLAP)

02:05:24.602 --> 02:05:26.228
<i>What the hell?</i>
