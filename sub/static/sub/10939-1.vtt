{\a6}Heart Transplant Candidate LESLEY WALKER

00:16.940 --> 00:20.450
Your daughter is first on our region's transplant list.

00:23.260 --> 00:25.320
She's so weak.

00:27.240 --> 00:31.260
We'll have her into surgery the minute the right heart becomes available.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.850
She's just so weak.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.890
We'll keep her strong,
and we'll transplant her successfully.

00:44.340 --> 00:46.430
Dr. Darren,O.R.

00:46.460 --> 00:49.420
Dr. Darren.

00:49.540 --> 00:50.970
How much more time do you think life support will buy her?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.530
What's your name again?

00:52.560 --> 00:53.230
Simon.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.780
Where you from?

00:54.810 --> 00:55.810
Vancouver,canada.

00:55.830 --> 00:59.000
The truth is there's no medical reason
that little girl has held on as long as she has.

00:59.030 --> 01:01.630
- Dr.Darren, Your board interview's in 30 minutes.
- I know.

01:01.650 --> 01:04.980
You might want to change that shirt and wash up.

01:05.610 --> 01:06.820
Also,some guy named henry called.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.200
He said he's got the clemente,said you have the number.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.290
I'm gonna be out of contact for about an hour.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.100
You can round with mary.

01:14.270 --> 01:17.090
Uh,nsv 10 clemente -- what is that,some kind of new machine?

01:17.120 --> 01:17.790
It's a baseball card.

01:17.810 --> 01:19.790
He collects baseball cards.

01:19.860 --> 01:20.530
Baseball card?

01:20.570 --> 01:21.420
Yeah,baseball.

01:21.450 --> 01:24.490
They do have baseball in canada,don't they?

01:25.960 --> 01:27.420
Vancouver.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.730
You,vancouver,find out what the hell's happening
with that potential donor at county general.

POTENTIAL  HEART DONOR JOHN HENDERSON

01:40.230 --> 01:41.820
Can we discontinue care?

01:41.850 --> 01:44.470
The woman from organ recovery is still talking to the grandmother.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.340
His heart can save a life,Mrs. Henderson.

01:48.100 --> 01:51.020
I don't want my grandson's body cut up.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.660
But he won't be disfigured in any way.

01:53.730 --> 01:55.920
In fact,when you next see him,
you won't even notice it.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.400
I don't want you selling his organs.

01:58.970 --> 02:03.960
Mrs. Henderson,I promise you the placement
of the organs is carefully regulated.

02:04.020 --> 02:06.510
Will you people pay for his funeral?

02:08.110 --> 02:10.259
That's not the way it works.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.700
I don't want him cut up.

02:15.440 --> 02:19.840
Mrs. Henderson,there are people in desperate need waiting,

02:19.850 --> 02:22.820
particularly one little girl who's 每

02:25.790 --> 02:27.870
your grandson's death does not have to be 每

02:27.880 --> 02:29.650
I don't want him cut up.

02:30.220 --> 02:31.820
Meaningless.

02:32.350 --> 02:34.270
I want to get him out of here.

Hey.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.960
You -- you are letting me die.

02:53.010 --> 02:55.810
That's just the steroids talking,Mr. Kozinski.

02:55.890 --> 02:58.230
No luck getting that donor at county general?

02:59.780 --> 03:00.910
Look,I know I screwed up.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.320
I don't need your passaggressive bullshit to remind me.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.420
I just exhaled.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.770
Exactly.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.680
I got the bill for your final mortgage payment.

03:07.720 --> 03:08.350
That's the last one.

03:08.380 --> 03:09.740
That's good news.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.050
Yeah,we should go out,have dinner,celebrate,pop a bottle of champagne.

03:13.120 --> 03:13.930
Oh,I forgot.

03:13.960 --> 03:14.960
You divorced me.

03:14.990 --> 03:18.540
Well,I'm sure you can find some nice,young nurse to celebrate with,nate.

03:27.620 --> 03:31.170
Okay,any new patient developments I need to know about?

03:31.320 --> 03:34.020
Mr. Kozinski keeps getting out of bed and yelling at me.

03:34.050 --> 03:36.570
Anything important I should know about?

03:36.810 --> 03:39.550
All right,lesley walker in 124.

03:39.970 --> 03:43.010
Well,we didn't get the heart over at county that we were hoping for.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.540
That kid at county's off the vent?

03:44.590 --> 03:46.570
Kate can answer that question.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.970
Yes,his mother declined.

03:50.990 --> 03:54.290
So he is off the vent.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.060
I know that one life did everything they could,

03:56.100 --> 03:58.590
but we've has lesley on the assist for two weeks.

03:58.620 --> 04:01.780
She's had two strokes in the last five days.

04:01.870 --> 04:03.600
I know everyone's doing the best they can here,

04:03.620 --> 04:08.670
but I think it's time we prepare her mother for the very real possibility.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.750
Dr. Sharp,4632.

04:44.590 --> 04:46.430
I want you to have my heart.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.610
I'm doing this for you,baby.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.400

05:23.340 --> 05:24.960
Mrs. Walker thought if she overdosed with the morphine,

05:24.980 --> 05:27.320
she could give her heart to her daughter.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.930
So you called in psych?

05:28.980 --> 05:30.270
Yeah,she tried to kill herself.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.300
The only reason I'd report Mrs. Walker to psych is

05:32.330 --> 05:35.370
if she didn't want to donate her organs to her daughter.

05:42.590 --> 05:45.700
I know you can't help me kill myself.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.520
Mrs. Walker...

05:51.200 --> 05:53.370
the matching process isn't easy,

05:53.420 --> 05:55.790
particular for a girl lesley's age and size.

05:55.820 --> 06:01.130
But I can still do it with a gun or pills if it'll save my daughteR.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.840
Well-placed bullet,potential overdose --

06:03.870 --> 06:06.090
it doesn't always work out the way you think.

06:06.180 --> 06:08.280
Then you're dead,and we can't even use your organs.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.370
You can't guarantee a heart will come in time.

06:11.510 --> 06:14.160
I can guarantee that I will not give a new heart to a young girl

06:14.180 --> 06:17.230
who has no one to care for her after the transplant.

06:22.690 --> 06:26.040
Mrs. Walker,any heart that comes available tonight 每

06:26.310 --> 06:29.570
I will take it,and I will make it work for her.

06:30.350 --> 06:32.340
I promise you.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.890
we have a reservation in one hour.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.510
Come on. You need to unwind,relax a little bit.

07:19.530 --> 07:20.760
I'm sorry, If something comes up --

07:20.790 --> 07:23.860

07:54.690 --> 07:58.400
I failed with that black kid at county general,

07:58.460 --> 08:00.750
and now I don't think lesley walker's gonna make it.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.460
That black kid weighed almost 150 pounds.

08:03.490 --> 08:06.290
Nathaniel would have made his heart work for her.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.170
Why don't I call lynn in,cover the rest of your shift?

08:10.190 --> 08:13.060
And nathaniel's gonna blow his board interview.

08:13.750 --> 08:16.730
He's so afraid they'll hire that total turd pena to come and run the place.

08:16.780 --> 08:19.310
We could go out and get some dinner.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.070
I'm gonna finish my shift,bill.

08:22.540 --> 08:23.800
I'm fine.

08:23.850 --> 08:25.800
Really,I'm fine.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.550
Another donor will come available,

08:28.560 --> 08:32.900
and I will get right back in there and get their consent.

08:33.470 --> 08:35.150
That's the spirit.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.230
I'm sorry.

08:47.810 --> 08:49.350
Hey,sweetie.

08:53.250 --> 08:56.630
- I'll be right there.
- What?

08:57.480 --> 08:59.530
Thea's gotten into some trouble.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.220
Are you her mother?

09:16.230 --> 09:17.350
I am.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.560
She tried to steal these condoms.

09:20.110 --> 09:22.730
The owner's not gonna call the police or anything.

09:22.740 --> 09:24.030
Thank you. We really appreciate that.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.540
Well,she's not allowed back in here.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.360
Thea -

09:37.860 --> 09:39.860
Okay,we have to get to the hospital.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.000
But we are gonna talk about this.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.260

10:14.080 --> 10:14.950
No.

10:14.970 --> 10:16.390
Husband's name is mark.

10:16.410 --> 10:19.450
He's undecided about signing the forms.

10:19.850 --> 10:20.870
Okay. Can you take this?

10:20.900 --> 10:22.300
Sure.

11:50.920 --> 12:00.000
Calm down and get straight it's in our eyes,

12:00.030 --> 12:03.250
it's how we operate

12:04.810 --> 12:10.920
you're true you are whoa,

12:10.940 --> 12:13.950
whoa,you're gonna have to wait here,Mrs. Walker.

12:15.210 --> 12:16.490
Go.

12:21.910 --> 12:23.800
How old's your daughter?

12:23.990 --> 12:25.400
13.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.220
She's 13.

12:28.240 --> 12:31.050
My dad might not be so good with people,but...

12:32.450 --> 12:34.440
he's really good at this.

12:37.470 --> 12:39.070
Let's get started.

12:39.690 --> 12:41.460
Scalpel,jessica.

12:56.010 --> 12:57.720
Turn off the respiratoR.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.890
Let's give her a moment.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.620
okay, back to work.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.580
Start the perfusion.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.130
Bring me some ice.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.910
Take this heart to Dr. Grant.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.500
Without you

13:51.720 --> 13:54.600
well, I'm left hollow

13:55.220 --> 14:01.190
can we decide to try a little joy tomorrow?

14:02.250 --> 14:06.770
'Cause,baby,tonight I'll follow

14:09.520 --> 14:11.230
Okay,jessica,bring the heart to the field.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.650
Here you go.

14:12.660 --> 14:13.300
Thank you.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.500
******

14:14.910 --> 14:16.520
It looks ischemic.

14:17.130 --> 14:17.880
We had a little problem.

14:17.910 --> 14:18.940
I can see that.

14:18.950 --> 14:20.200
Suction.

14:20.710 --> 14:21.930
Suction.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.370
How well did it perfuse in the O.R.?

14:24.530 --> 14:25.500
Too badly damaged?

14:25.520 --> 14:28.000
Okay,everybody,let's commit.

14:28.010 --> 14:29.640
Forceps.

14:30.450 --> 14:31.870
Forceps on the field.

14:33.670 --> 14:34.800
Thank you.

14:45.220 --> 14:47.170
Hey. Watching daddy?

14:53.690 --> 14:56.100
We need to continue our conversation.

14:56.860 --> 14:58.490
It's 3:00 in the morning,mom.

14:58.610 --> 14:59.850
So?

15:07.250 --> 15:08.600
She looks good.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.350
Great work,everybody.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.290
Okay,vancouver,you can close her up.

15:38.130 --> 15:39.680
Dr. Grant?

15:44.100 --> 15:45.760
Dr. Grant?

15:50.200 --> 15:51.960
Was there something else?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.020
No.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.330
Hey.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.480
Hey.

16:28.110 --> 16:29.680
You want to come in?

16:36.230 --> 16:38.260
I'll wait out here. Thanks.

16:41.980 --> 16:44.100
Great work with that husband last night.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.600
Thea was caught stealing condoms at the mall drugstore.

16:54.490 --> 16:57.430
Her attitude and her school stuff are one thing.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.830
But sex?

16:58.850 --> 17:00.930
She's barely 14.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.210
I'll talk to her.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.589
I'm not so sure talk is what she needs.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.740
What do you have in mind?

17:05.760 --> 17:08.869
I think it's time to consider finding her a professional to talk to.

17:08.890 --> 17:11.950
oh, come on, ***Can't we all just sit down and fix this --

17:11.970 --> 17:14.010
mom,dad,don't want to be late.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.040
Here's the final payment.

17:26.220 --> 17:29.380
That girl from last night,lesley -- her mom seems so nice.

17:29.420 --> 17:30.570
What the hell were you thinking?

17:30.600 --> 17:32.600
My mom,on the other hand,is being such a bitch.

17:32.610 --> 17:33.910
Don't talk about her like that.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.080
You do.

17:39.290 --> 17:41.440
You stole condoms?

17:42.760 --> 17:44.950
You treat lung patients every day.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.830
I mean,did someone put you up to that,like it was a joke or something?

17:54.410 --> 17:55.710
Your mother thinks you actually were considering 每

17:55.730 --> 17:58.770
well,mom told me she'd be home in time to take me to the mall.

17:58.790 --> 17:59.570
*****

17:59.600 --> 18:02.790
Sex is a very serious issue,sweetheart,

18:02.820 --> 18:06.630
and you are far too young and far too removed from authentic relationships 每

18:06.660 --> 18:07.710
what's the real reason you and mom split?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.840
Don't****

18:09.860 --> 18:13.170
It's because of that nurse from the hospital -- jessica,right?

18:15.100 --> 18:16.870
Are you in love with her?

18:20.040 --> 18:22.380
See? You sleep with her,but you don't love her.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.330
Well,whatever you do in your relationships,don't use me as a role model.

18:25.370 --> 18:28.610
I'm just saying it's not exactly an authentic relationship.

18:28.630 --> 18:33.540
Who is this boy that you care so much about you'd steal condoms from a drugstore?

18:34.780 --> 18:36.620
Dave torres.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.980
He's captain of the soccer team.

18:40.020 --> 18:41.430
Okay.

18:41.500 --> 18:45.410
And he told me he'd take me to the semiformal if I hooked with him.

18:45.490 --> 18:47.720
Well,then go with someone else.

18:48.690 --> 18:50.190
You don't understand,daD.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.540
No one else is gonna ask me.

19:01.570 --> 19:06.290
Dr. Grant,how do you define your current role at st.Jude?

19:06.380 --> 19:09.210
Oh,I'm just a guy with a knife and some string,really.

19:09.840 --> 19:14.860
Seriously,I just finish the job that the immunologists,biologists,geneticists,

19:14.880 --> 19:16.320
and everyone else start.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.960
If we awarded you the position of clinical director,

19:20.010 --> 19:23.900
how would you change the course of the transplant institution?

19:23.940 --> 19:26.510
Using the dead as our donor base is our best option today,

19:26.550 --> 19:32.290
but years from now,it's my hope that the living and animals

19:32.310 --> 19:34.910
will serve the needs of a much greater number of patients

19:34.930 --> 19:38.350
and create more successful results in the long term.

19:38.570 --> 19:42.470
The risks to the living involved with this type of procedure,

19:42.500 --> 19:45.550
the public outcry in defense of animals 每

19:45.590 --> 19:49.120
for me to do my job correctly and well,

19:49.160 --> 19:51.180
I'm going to need your complete support.

19:51.210 --> 19:53.520
If you gentlemen don't feel you can give that to me,

19:53.550 --> 19:56.070
then I'm not the right man for this position.

20:11.600 --> 20:15.420
august pena is coming in to interview with the board,

20:15.450 --> 20:20.140
and I can promise you he will not be so...provocative.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.220
And he rejects all borderline candidates

20:22.230 --> 20:25.020
and dismisses any organ that has even the slightest blemish.

20:25.040 --> 20:29.070
Nate,his clinic has the lowest death rate in the world.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.360
They're not swelling.

20:34.130 --> 20:36.130
Come on. I'll make this fast.

20:36.580 --> 20:41.480
And you've got to understand -- this guy knows how to raise money big-time.

20:41.970 --> 20:44.010
The board will be very impressed by that.

20:44.630 --> 20:48.310
Yeah,well,if you want happy government officials and inflated success rates,

20:48.360 --> 20:50.090
maybe you should hire pena.

20:50.110 --> 20:51.470
Any peripheral edema?

20:51.470 --> 20:52.300
I've got ipf.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.780
I think we both know what happens next.

20:55.050 --> 20:56.360
Take off your shirt.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.320
When are you going home to your family?

20:59.340 --> 21:00.970
Bart,please take off your shirt.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.110
You didn't answer the question.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.530
I am home -- in my apartment.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.740
Your lungs sound like crap.

21:11.810 --> 21:14.590
We need to admit you to the icu,get you placed on a list.

21:14.630 --> 21:17.830
Would you just consider what the patient wants?

21:17.880 --> 21:19.590
To live,I assume.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.230
I got to go.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.860
Would you consider letting me admit you?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.510
one life

21:43.240 --> 21:45.150
Mr. Evans.

21:48.710 --> 21:50.760
I don't have an appointment.

21:51.230 --> 21:52.750
It's okay.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.240
Why don't you have a seat?

22:13.250 --> 22:15.880
Sarah hated my suit.

22:17.710 --> 22:19.240
I,um...

22:19.670 --> 22:21.220
we were going to a wedding this weekend,

22:21.240 --> 22:25.440
so we went shopping to find me something to wear to the wedding.

22:25.450 --> 22:29.670
And we're pulling out of the mall.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.670
And this car comes out of nowhere.

22:37.460 --> 22:38.930
And I didn't even --

22:39.400 --> 22:43.260
I didn't even get a scratch,not -- not a scratch.

22:46.640 --> 22:51.780
So the clothing company calls me,and they say,"your suit's ready."

22:55.340 --> 22:58.120
I mean,what am I supposed to do with that?

23:00.570 --> 23:02.870
What am I supposed to do with that?

23:03.170 --> 23:04.750
Mr. Evans... ...

23:07.700 --> 23:09.740
we do offer counseling services if you --

23:09.750 --> 23:11.990
who received my wife's heart?

23:12.610 --> 23:14.700
I can't give you that information.

23:14.770 --> 23:16.720
Can you give them my name?

23:21.290 --> 23:28.000
Mr. Evans,the decision to make contact is up to the family of the donor and recipient.

23:28.090 --> 23:29.650
It could take a long time to be ready to --

23:29.680 --> 23:31.530
I can't eat.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.180
I can't sleep. I...

23:39.140 --> 23:44.880
I need to know that something good...came from this.

23:48.450 --> 23:51.950
Did something good come of this?

23:55.740 --> 23:58.640
The recipient is a teenaged girl.

24:05.980 --> 24:08.510
Here in -- in the city?

24:08.860 --> 24:10.660
I can only tell you that it was local

24:10.670 --> 24:14.150
and that she received her heart last night.

24:29.490 --> 24:31.740
Everything we're measuring
is stable,Mrs. Walker.

24:31.750 --> 24:34.700
Heart output is fine.It's
beating rhythmically.

24:34.710 --> 24:36.370
So she's gonna be fine.

24:36.380 --> 24:38.580
- She's gonna be -
- she's very stable.

24:38.590 --> 24:42.070
Oh,thank you.Thank you.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.820
Where's your damned oxygen canister?

24:49.720 --> 24:51.590
How long have you been short of breath?

24:51.600 --> 24:54.590
- Just a few minutes.
- ********

24:54.600 --> 24:56.190
You need to be admitted.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.520
I've got the pena interview.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.920
Take bart back to his
office.Hook him up.

24:58.930 --> 25:01.720
Don't argur with me Go on.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.050
I was first up for a
transplant seven months ago.

25:06.060 --> 25:09.520
- My wife and kids were prepared
- - I can only take what I'm given.

25:09.530 --> 25:12.500
Another doctor wouldn't do this to me.

25:12.510 --> 25:15.550
Another doctor wouldn't
have done this to me.

25:15.560 --> 25:19.050
I'm sorry,but I never said a lung
reduction would cure you,Mr. Kozinski.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.920
I just said it would buy you more time.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.500
Dr. Jacobs' office.

25:26.510 --> 25:28.970
- Nathaniel.
- August.

25:28.980 --> 25:31.050
- Good to see you.
- You too.

25:31.960 --> 25:35.400
Well...good luck in the interview.

25:37.150 --> 25:41.120
You know,I've been disappointed about some of the
comments you've made regarding my work,nathaniel.

25:41.130 --> 25:44.600
I am afraid that you misunderstand
my approach to this job.

25:44.610 --> 25:48.820
August,I've taken almost every organ
you've rejected over the last five years,

25:48.830 --> 25:52.270
flown them an extra five hours,and used
them on patients that you would never accept,

25:52.280 --> 25:54.990
so,no,I don't think I
misunderstand your approach.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.600
In fact,it's quite the contrary.

25:56.610 --> 25:58.960
Dr. Grant,I need some help!

26:00.440 --> 26:02.040
- What happened?
- I don't know.He just passed out.

26:02.050 --> 26:03.790
Check his oxygen.

26:15.190 --> 26:17.670
How did bart's diagnostics go?

26:17.680 --> 26:19.530
Well,the cat scan looked pretty bad.

26:19.540 --> 26:23.590
Pulmonary function tests,arterial blood gases
indicate he's within range of a transplant.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.030
Blood tests?

26:25.040 --> 26:26.570
The six-minute walk
test had him in range.

26:26.580 --> 26:28.690
Vancouver,the blood tests?

26:28.700 --> 26:31.100
Bart tested positive for hep "C."

26:33.460 --> 26:36.930
I guess we shouldn't be surprised
-- these old guys,so many surgeries.

26:36.940 --> 26:39.320
You probably all have it.

26:41.450 --> 26:43.110
Right there.Good.

26:44.300 --> 26:46.480
Hey.Want me to come over tonight?

26:46.490 --> 26:47.400
Absolutely.

26:47.410 --> 26:50.020
Vancouver,lesley walker's room.

26:50.030 --> 26:53.080
I thought maybe we could
have a date or something 每

26:53.090 --> 26:55.820
go to dinner,a movie,some normal time.

26:56.370 --> 27:00.980
Jessica...I'm not so
good at normal time.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.910
Blood pressure's dropping.She's
having arrhythmias.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.100
Get an ecmo in here.

27:13.110 --> 27:14.720
What's wrong?

27:14.730 --> 27:17.630
We're going to bring in a mechanical
support for lesley's heart.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.420
You said the surgery went well.

27:19.430 --> 27:23.970
Lesley's immune system thinks that
this new organ is a foreign invader,

27:23.980 --> 27:28.140
so we'll treat her with antirejection
drugs,rest her heart for now.

27:28.150 --> 27:29.130
For now?

27:29.140 --> 27:30.820
Well,we're gonna give it some time,

27:30.830 --> 27:34.340
see if we can reverse this,give
her heart a chance to take.

27:39.670 --> 27:41.930
Well,you got me on too
much corticosteroid.

27:41.940 --> 27:45.360
Well,your airway is severely
blockeD.You need the lung relaxer.

27:45.370 --> 27:47.410
My oxygen's all screwed up.

27:47.420 --> 27:50.080
Bart,you also have hepatitis.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.810
You're not surprised?

27:57.820 --> 28:01.310
I've been elbow-deep in another
people's blood for 50 years.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.970
We can still proceed with a transplant.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.410
And if I were,uh,some other patient?

28:07.420 --> 28:09.530
I would tell you the same thing.

28:09.540 --> 28:12.550
We'll transplant the lungs,and
if we need to do the liver,

28:12.560 --> 28:15.770
we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.Okay?

28:18.310 --> 28:22.510
I heard how our young fellow screwed
up on his first heart recovery.

28:23.860 --> 28:26.560
I wouldn't rush to re-transplant her.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.930
Well,she'll die if I don'T.

28:30.130 --> 28:33.520
I would watch and wait with that girl.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.540
If you're gonna take over my position,

28:37.550 --> 28:40.580
you can't cut every
time there's a problem.

29:48.130 --> 29:50.590
Classify lesley walker 1a.

29:50.600 --> 29:53.430
Alert the staff I
plan to re-transplant.

29:55.390 --> 29:57.010
What is it?

29:57.020 --> 29:59.950
We're gonna need another
heart for lesley walker.

30:23.620 --> 30:26.030
Dr. Bryan,3371.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.500
Dr. Bryan,3371.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.020
Oh,excuse me.I'm sorry.

30:37.030 --> 30:39.920
You're -- you're lesley
walker's surgeon,aren't you?

30:39.930 --> 30:41.230
Yes.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.480
How is the heart that
she received doing?

30:43.490 --> 30:45.650
May I ask who you are?

30:45.660 --> 30:47.110
Lesley walker's my family.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.200
I'm --
I'm family.

30:51.300 --> 30:54.170
I'm family.

30:56.300 --> 30:59.340
- Do you know that man?
- No.

31:05.460 --> 31:06.430
I'll tell him.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.310
Uh,Dr. Grant?

31:09.210 --> 31:10.170
That was bill bryce.

31:10.180 --> 31:12.450
There's a potential lung
donor -- male,200 pounds.

31:12.460 --> 31:14.580
The plane's ready if you are.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.550
LUNG RECOVERY RUN

31:23.020 --> 31:24.010
Kozinski?

31:24.020 --> 31:25.950
That's what unos said.

31:26.930 --> 31:28.820
Kozinski?

31:30.020 --> 31:32.890
I'm flying all day to
get organs for kozinski?

31:32.900 --> 31:35.430
I could have sent vancouver.

31:42.470 --> 31:44.500
You know,we've never really talked.

31:46.400 --> 31:50.000
Never really gotten to know each other.

31:50.550 --> 31:51.800
I know.

31:51.810 --> 31:54.190
We should go out sometime.

31:54.200 --> 31:56.640
You think?

31:56.650 --> 31:59.880
Let bygones be bygones.

32:00.220 --> 32:03.260
Okay.I'd like that.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.470
Kozinski's hypertension
is out of control.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.820
Blood count sky-high.

32:09.830 --> 32:11.470
Right side of his heart is enlarged.

32:11.480 --> 32:12.710
Bart's in worse shape than that.

32:12.720 --> 32:15.440
All I can do is give
the data to unos*****

32:15.450 --> 32:16.480
That's a load of crap.

32:16.490 --> 32:19.660
*******I love bart as
much as anybody else.

32:19.670 --> 32:21.710
This is our call,kate,not a computer'S.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.030
Nate,it is a computer's call.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.660
Shut up,bill.We're not talking to you.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.210
I'm just saying this is exactly
why a system has been put in place.

32:29.220 --> 32:30.960
Bill.

32:40.900 --> 32:43.380
I -- I really
like your shoes.

32:44.450 --> 32:46.630
Thank you.

32:46.890 --> 32:49.940
It's just like you -- all
about rules,regulations.

32:49.950 --> 32:50.880
What are you saying?

32:50.890 --> 32:55.180
You've always been a stickler for little
things that make very little sense.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.040
I hope you're not talking
about our marriage.

32:57.050 --> 32:58.170
I'm talking about you.

32:58.180 --> 33:00.600
I didn't tolerate your infidelities.

33:00.610 --> 33:03.430
Is that the little rule I
was being a stickler about?

33:03.440 --> 33:05.650
I broke some promises.You
broke them,too.

33:05.660 --> 33:06.390
******

33:06.400 --> 33:08.000
You promised that you
were gonna stop working.

33:08.010 --> 33:10.480
You promised you were
gonna stay home with thea.

33:10.490 --> 33:13.640
- I tried.
- We needed a normal life.

33:13.650 --> 33:16.560
Could you two discuss this another time?

33:17.260 --> 33:19.580
Yes.Absolutely.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.650
And I'm sorry,bill.

33:23.890 --> 33:26.690
Jessica,too.I'm sorry.

33:31.480 --> 33:34.160
Very inappropriate.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.710
Even if I had stopped working,

33:40.720 --> 33:44.900
what part of normal is being married
to an egomaniacal workaholic insomniac

33:44.910 --> 33:48.770
that screws every nurse who works
within five miles of st. Jude's?

33:54.170 --> 33:56.400
RURAL VIRGINIA HOSPITAL

33:56.410 --> 33:57.690
LUNG DONOR

33:57.700 --> 34:00.580
You're saving literally
hundreds of lives.

34:00.950 --> 34:02.640
You're sure,derek?

34:03.280 --> 34:05.080
Okay.Thanks.

34:05.090 --> 34:07.840
Nate,unos just sent word.

34:07.850 --> 34:12.610
The size of the organ's reversed the
order,so bart's first up for the lungs.

34:15.710 --> 34:18.620
I'll call st.Jude's and tell
them to start prepping him.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.650
Thank you.

34:21.659 --> 34:24.190
It's never been up to me.

34:26.550 --> 34:28.290
Yeah,okay.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.080
I'll let him know.

34:30.429 --> 34:32.480
Dr. Powers,icu.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.679
Dr. Powers,icu.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.650
What is it?

34:37.659 --> 34:42.540
Bart jacobs just removed
himself from the recipient list.

34:42.550 --> 34:44.810
- I'll tell him.
- No.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.370
I will.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.200
Did kozinski's surgery go well?

35:09.210 --> 35:11.660
Mary,would you give us a moment,please?

35:14.450 --> 35:17.450
The board called for my recommendation.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.340
Truth be known,it's very difficult
to choose between you and pena.

35:20.350 --> 35:22.720
I flew all day and
performed the recovery.

35:22.730 --> 35:23.900
I didn't ask you to do that.

35:23.910 --> 35:26.970
I sewed two perfectly
good lungs into --

35:26.980 --> 35:29.460
- how did the operation go?
- Come on,bart!

35:29.470 --> 35:31.350
I can give you a few more good years.

35:31.360 --> 35:36.240
Oh,please,the surgeries,the drug
treatment -- not exactly good years.

35:36.250 --> 35:38.700
All you ever cared
about was extending life.

35:38.710 --> 35:40.970
Now that you have a chance
to benefit from that --

35:40.980 --> 35:43.440
an extended life in the icu.

35:43.450 --> 35:45.210
You have us to take care of you.

35:45.220 --> 35:48.210
I've lived most of my
life in this hospital.

35:48.220 --> 35:50.540
I don't want to spend my death here.

35:50.550 --> 35:52.390
I can do this.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.110
I can make this work for you.

35:54.120 --> 35:58.930
When are you gonna understand that none
of this has to do with what you want?

36:04.990 --> 36:07.610
I'm not ready for you to go.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.390
Help me up.

36:33.100 --> 36:36.660
So,I,um,I talked to the board today.

36:37.080 --> 36:40.820
I told them that I want
you to,uh,take my place.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.630
They approved.

36:47.630 --> 36:49.990
Thank you.

36:54.190 --> 36:56.670
Mary.

37:01.630 --> 37:05.000
It's about time for me to go home.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.830
That young girl.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.440
If I were you,I'd just watch and wait.

37:17.620 --> 37:21.380
Yeah.Just watch and waiT.

37:45.470 --> 37:48.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:48.910 --> 37:52.430
I'm sorry I just walked
in,but the door was open.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.810
No,it's all right.

37:56.030 --> 37:58.030
I just wanted to see how you were.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.470
Oh,I'm fine.I'm fine.

38:01.940 --> 38:05.070
Yeah,I know.It's
-- I know.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.390
Can I get you some coffee or tea?

38:08.570 --> 38:10.420
No,thanks.

38:16.900 --> 38:20.080
You've really perfected the
whole cardboard-chic thing.

38:20.090 --> 38:22.610
I'm glad you appreciate it
'cause I worked my ass off.

38:25.240 --> 38:29.180
You know that man you
had removed from icu?

38:29.190 --> 38:33.350
Uh,his wife donated
lesley walker's heart.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.540
He came to me yesterday,and
I stupidly gave him a hint --

38:37.550 --> 38:40.130
I got the chairmanship.

38:43.050 --> 38:48.980
So now I'm -- I'm
head of the whole...

38:50.770 --> 38:53.730
you don't seem to happy about it.

38:56.220 --> 38:59.330
There was this clemente
rookie card over at henry'S.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.900
He said it was perfect.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.960
But I couldn't get there.

39:06.820 --> 39:09.300
I didn't get there in time.

39:10.900 --> 39:14.000
I can never be anywhere.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.560
You need to take a break,nate.

39:22.570 --> 39:25.950
I can't be away from the hospital.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.180
I try to do other things.

39:27.190 --> 39:31.160
I -- I try to
be a father...

39:31.880 --> 39:34.620
a husband...

39:34.630 --> 39:37.250
collect a damn baseball card.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.350
It's not easy to be you.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.440
You've got a lot of pressure on you.

39:43.450 --> 39:46.740
You have people's lives in your hands.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.860
I'm sorry,katie.

39:57.220 --> 40:00.110
I'm just so sorry.

40:27.580 --> 40:30.610
You okay?

40:46.660 --> 40:48.400
- Get some sleep.
- Thank you.

40:48.410 --> 40:50.610
Hey,I went to the farmer's market.

40:50.620 --> 40:53.470
I picked
up some --

40:55.010 --> 40:56.410
jessica...

41:22.680 --> 41:24.540
How's Mr. Kozinski doing?

41:24.550 --> 41:27.420
Kozinski seems to be
doing remarkably well.

41:27.430 --> 41:28.920
Lesley walker?

41:28.930 --> 41:30.940
Heart rate's steady.Her fever's down.

41:30.950 --> 41:32.680
She seems to be improving.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.460
She's improving.

41:35.560 --> 41:38.390
I don't know if she's
improving fast enough.

41:43.180 --> 41:44.480
Hello,Dr. Griffith.

41:44.490 --> 41:46.730
- Dr. Grant,can I have a word?
- Sure.

41:46.740 --> 41:48.750
I'll be right back.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.060
A heart is available for lesley.

41:59.070 --> 42:02.340
It's a good cross match.The
donor's 15 years old.

42:06.090 --> 42:08.420
I'm gonna pass on it.

42:08.430 --> 42:10.170
You are?

42:10.180 --> 42:12.660
I'm gonna give the first
heart a chance to take.

42:15.690 --> 42:17.680
Okay.

42:20.330 --> 42:24.490
Roy,tell unos st.Jude's is passing.

42:31.470 --> 42:33.880
What?

42:36.700 --> 42:39.660
If you came back home......

42:41.410 --> 42:46.570
you'd still always live here,no
matter where you try to sleep.

42:47.780 --> 42:52.630
You'd lie awake at night,blame me for
your problems,and then you'd leave again.

42:54.850 --> 42:56.810
Wouldn't you?

42:58.190 --> 43:00.970
Maybe.

43:03.070 --> 43:05.570
I don't know,kate.

43:06.960 --> 43:09.390
Maybe this time...

43:10.700 --> 43:12.780
maybe...

43:14.950 --> 43:17.620
What did you tell jessica?

43:20.820 --> 43:23.120
Uh,I told her...

43:25.220 --> 43:27.640
I told her...

43:28.790 --> 43:31.750
you told her that...

43:31.760 --> 43:37.130
it was a slip,an old habit...

43:37.140 --> 43:41.210
fallback during a sad time.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.740
Is that right?

43:52.360 --> 43:55.940
So are you sure I should
make this new heart available?

43:56.740 --> 43:59.600
- Yes.
- Okay.

44:00.350 --> 44:03.960
I'll take my heart elsewhere.

44:15.570 --> 44:18.080
It looks like she's past the rejection.

44:22.100 --> 44:24.870
- Hey,lesley.
- Hi,Dr. Grant.

44:24.880 --> 44:26.810
How you feeling?

44:27.600 --> 44:29.330
It hurts.

44:29.340 --> 44:32.150
I'm sorry that it hurts.

44:36.540 --> 44:38.470
Thank you.

44:38.900 --> 44:43.030
Well...okay. ...

44:54.860 --> 44:57.940
your wife's heart --
it's working again.

44:57.950 --> 45:00.110
It's going to be fine.

45:01.490 --> 45:02.800
Thank you.

45:02.810 --> 45:05.000
You're the one to be thanked.

45:05.200 --> 45:08.600
I'm going up.You can come.

45:16.280 --> 45:18.550
what was your wife's name?

45:19.090 --> 45:21.240
Sarah.

45:21.250 --> 45:23.340
Sarah.

45:34.860 --> 45:40.530
I know how this sounds,but sometimes
I can see the donors in my patients.

45:41.090 --> 45:43.580
You can see sarah?

45:47.990 --> 45:50.180
I know how that sounds.

45:55.240 --> 45:57.180
no.

45:57.420 --> 46:00.100
Thank you for telling me.

46:02.030 --> 46:04.390
Do you have a wife?

46:05.420 --> 46:07.760
I did.

46:08.970 --> 46:11.280
You lost her.

46:14.760 --> 46:18.120
I let her lose me.

46:22.430 --> 46:25.390
You can stay.
