00:23.780 --> 00:25.480
man: Wake the hell up!

00:25.550 --> 00:27.020
You're gonna be late,
doofus.

01:15.370 --> 01:16.340
Sis?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.300
Oh, there you are.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.630
Get your lazy ass goin'.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.870
You're gonna miss
the cheese wagon.

01:21.940 --> 01:24.270
And, no, you can't borrow
my BMX.

01:24.340 --> 01:27.070
It's got a flat.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.240
Jesus, kiddo.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.650
You've seen that movie
damn near 50 times.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.410
You're gonna
wear out the VHS.

01:33.490 --> 01:34.650
Go on.

02:13.390 --> 02:15.690
( school bell ringing )

02:49.100 --> 02:51.430
girl: This is my life.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.060
I'm a 14-year-old girl.

02:54.130 --> 02:57.730
Or... actually,
a hybrid..

02:57.800 --> 03:00.170
girl and boy.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.330
When my mother was alive,

03:02.410 --> 03:05.280
she told me
I was a hermaphrodite.

03:05.350 --> 03:08.580
But my brother just always
called me...

03:08.650 --> 03:11.550
Spork!

03:13.120 --> 03:15.420
( children laughing )

04:09.680 --> 04:11.700
( toilet flushing )

04:19.089 --> 04:20.490
Hey.

04:20.550 --> 04:22.250
The name's Chunk.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.590
Kind of like "chink," but
instead they call me Chunk.

04:25.660 --> 04:27.590
Hi.

04:27.660 --> 04:30.890
My... my name's Spork.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.900
So, Spork, why are you cRyin'
like a little bitch?

04:37.540 --> 04:39.660
Because I'm sick
of being me.

04:39.740 --> 04:41.300
Hey, fuck that shit, man.

04:41.380 --> 04:42.900
Next time
somebody bothers you,

04:42.980 --> 04:44.600
all you gotta do is
close your eyes

04:44.680 --> 04:46.580
and think of something happy.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.580
# Spork and Chunk
sittin' in a tree #

04:48.650 --> 04:50.340
# E-A-T-I-- ##

05:02.530 --> 05:04.220
( giggling )

05:06.570 --> 05:08.400
That's...

05:08.470 --> 05:10.440
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my gosh!

05:10.500 --> 05:12.800
That is terrible.

05:12.870 --> 05:15.310
I think I can see her
ding-a-ling through her shoRts.

05:15.380 --> 05:16.870
( laughing )

05:18.580 --> 05:19.980
Seriously.

05:20.050 --> 05:22.950
Just close your eyes and think
of some happy shit.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.220
Wow.

05:35.830 --> 05:36.990
( gasping )

05:39.770 --> 05:40.860
... basketball.

05:40.930 --> 05:42.060
Oh, I did not...

05:42.140 --> 05:44.430
( whispering )

05:44.500 --> 05:46.100
She went on
a psychopathic rage.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.370
Nobody even knows
why she did it.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.070
Nobody even
knows where she lives.

05:50.140 --> 05:53.010
I think she's emo, or she,
like, she's crazy.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.570
And maybe she'll...

06:03.190 --> 06:05.720
( rock music playing )

06:09.300 --> 06:10.520
Hey, Spork.

06:10.600 --> 06:11.860
Proud of you today.

06:11.930 --> 06:14.260
School, I mean.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.700
Don't take shit
from people like that.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.270
Oh, yeah,
I fixed my BMX, too.

06:20.340 --> 06:22.830
So take that to
school now.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.510
See, Buster?

07:04.580 --> 07:06.250
Things are already
staRting to change.

07:09.490 --> 07:10.720
Oh, are you hungRy?

07:16.300 --> 07:18.790
( phone ringing )

07:21.070 --> 07:21.900
Hello?

07:21.970 --> 07:25.370
Hella-hella-hello, girl!

07:25.440 --> 07:26.800
Oh, hey, Tootsie Roll.

07:26.870 --> 07:29.470
I heard about your little
run-in with Betsy Byotch.

07:29.540 --> 07:30.410
Mmm!

07:30.480 --> 07:32.270
Can I just say damn!

07:32.350 --> 07:34.340
I'm so proud of you.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.310
And you
got off scot-free.

07:36.380 --> 07:39.580
I don't know, that big brother
of yours is mad fly.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.020
Principal Tulip.

07:43.090 --> 07:44.250
Spit.

07:46.890 --> 07:49.050
"Anyhoo," I'm proud
of you, okay?

07:49.130 --> 07:51.960
About time you
grew a pair of balls.

07:52.030 --> 07:54.360
Oh, uh...

07:54.430 --> 07:55.900
You know what
I mean, girl.

07:55.970 --> 07:56.940
So, listen up.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.870
The school dance-off
is comin' up,

07:58.940 --> 08:00.910
and "yous" knows
I'm all up in that.

08:00.970 --> 08:03.170
Better come this year
and cheer me on.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.010
Hey!

08:04.080 --> 08:05.600
I don't know, Tootsie Roll.

08:07.250 --> 08:10.270
I've never really been
to a school dance or--

08:10.350 --> 08:11.750
or dance-off thingy.

08:11.820 --> 08:14.690
Spork, we're
1 4 years old now.

08:14.750 --> 08:17.090
About time you grow up and stop
playin' with them little,

08:17.160 --> 08:19.590
you know, bonk-ass
toys and get out more.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.180
Damn.

08:21.260 --> 08:22.790
How do you know what I do?

08:24.830 --> 08:28.270
'Cause I live right
next door to you, ho!

08:28.340 --> 08:31.360
"Anyhoo," I need to win
this dance, okay?

08:31.440 --> 08:34.669
'Cause it be
a cash prize of $236.

08:34.740 --> 08:35.970
Oh!

08:36.039 --> 08:37.630
Wait.

08:37.710 --> 08:39.940
Why $236?

08:40.010 --> 08:41.880
Why not 250--

08:41.950 --> 08:42.809
I don't know!

08:42.880 --> 08:44.750
The point is,
with that bling,

08:44.820 --> 08:47.880
I could go see my daddy at
the CherRy Lane PenitentiaRy.

08:47.950 --> 08:49.980
Oh, my mama ain't never
gonna take me.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.550
And I know he'd be happy
as hell to see me up in there.

08:52.630 --> 08:53.750
Girl!

08:53.830 --> 08:54.990
You really think you'll win?

08:55.060 --> 08:58.430
Spork, ain't nobody can
shake their shit in a can

08:58.500 --> 09:00.560
Iike Tootsie Roll, okay?

09:01.970 --> 09:03.030
Shake their what?

09:03.100 --> 09:04.900
So we fittin' to go

09:04.970 --> 09:06.170

09:06.240 --> 09:07.400
I don't know.

09:07.470 --> 09:10.410
I mean, I... I still have
some homework to do.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.670
Bitch, please!

09:11.750 --> 09:13.240
Homework can wait, okay?

09:13.310 --> 09:15.680
You kicked a girl's ass today
for the first time.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.010
I'm comin' by after
eight-o-clocky-clock

09:18.080 --> 09:19.480
and pick you up
on my bike.

09:19.550 --> 09:21.180
I just got pegs.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.190
And this Afro Sheen
is off the hook.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.780
Mm-hmm, make my hair
all shiny and shit.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.490
Okay, later, ho.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.030
Ahh!

09:29.100 --> 09:30.790
Oh, yeah, girl!

09:39.110 --> 09:40.440
( knocking )

09:41.780 --> 09:43.270
Oh, my God.

09:45.950 --> 09:47.310
Oh, my God.

09:47.380 --> 09:48.750
You can't even tell.

09:48.820 --> 09:51.910
I am going to chop off that
bitch's little pecker

09:51.990 --> 09:53.420
the next
time I see her.

09:53.490 --> 09:55.550
Chill out, drama-rama.

09:55.620 --> 09:58.680
At least now you have an excuse
to get a nose job.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.950
I never
wanted a nose job!

10:01.030 --> 10:02.390
"Whatev."

10:02.460 --> 10:03.360
You know what I mean.

10:03.430 --> 10:05.330
I am cereal,
Loosie Goosie!

10:05.400 --> 10:07.560
I have to get her back
somehow.

10:07.630 --> 10:09.470
I am Betsy Byotch!

10:09.540 --> 10:11.870
Nobody gets away
with this.

10:11.940 --> 10:13.530
Even if she is a gimp.

10:13.610 --> 10:16.010
Well, why don't you pants her
in front of the whole school?

10:16.080 --> 10:17.010
That'll upset her.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.870
I could,
but that's not mean enough.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.810
I mean, who cares about her
fucking wee-wee, okay?

10:21.880 --> 10:24.350
I need to
scar her for life.

10:24.420 --> 10:25.820
Like she did moi!

10:27.190 --> 10:29.820
Just wait 'til
I think of something.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.520
She is gonna get it.

10:31.590 --> 10:32.850
( thundering )

10:37.060 --> 10:40.790
Oh, wow, J.Lo used to be a
dancer on "In Living Color"?

10:40.870 --> 10:41.990
So ghetto.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.630
Hey, Spork.

10:46.710 --> 10:48.370
You plannin' on
going somewhere?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.380
Tootsie Roll's gonna take me out
to some place called

10:50.440 --> 10:52.000
Booty Ballroom.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.980
Oh, yeah.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.280
That's a pretty cool shindig,

10:55.350 --> 10:57.750
I mean, if you're
a coal miner at least.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.610
I never hooked up with
no black chick.

11:02.490 --> 11:04.920
Well, don't be
home too late, kiddo.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.620
It's a school night.

11:06.690 --> 11:07.750
Hey.

11:07.830 --> 11:09.020
Spit.

11:09.100 --> 11:12.500
Candice just told me
she's pregnant.

11:12.570 --> 11:15.590
Is it yours, you big idiot?

11:15.670 --> 11:18.540
Does a chicken
have a pecker?

11:18.610 --> 11:21.130
Goddamn it, man, again?

11:24.610 --> 11:25.980
Goddamn it.

11:31.550 --> 11:33.040
Ooh!

11:33.120 --> 11:35.610
Girl, you gotta tell
that hick of a brother of yours

11:35.690 --> 11:37.490
to take a shower.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.720
Damn!

11:38.790 --> 11:40.850
I don't have
anything cool to wear.

11:40.930 --> 11:43.190
Maybe I should just
stay home.

11:43.260 --> 11:44.920
Oh, no, uh-uh.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.560
Let Tootsie Roll
have a look at you.

11:52.740 --> 11:55.610
Girl, you're gonna take all
the attention away from me.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.170
But it is
your night.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.440
Come on, let's go.

12:00.010 --> 12:03.920
( dance music playing
in distance )

12:03.980 --> 12:05.350
Hey, hey!

12:05.420 --> 12:06.350
Oh!

12:06.420 --> 12:07.680
You must be trippin'.

12:07.750 --> 12:08.910
Oh, oh, no.

12:08.990 --> 12:10.980
Twix, this is
a big day for Spork,

12:11.060 --> 12:13.550
and I'm fittin' to show her how
to break it off tonight.

12:13.630 --> 12:16.990
Now move out of my way,
or I'm gonna tell Mama!

12:17.060 --> 12:20.860
( dance music playing )

12:36.580 --> 12:38.780
All right, let me get two
Yoo-hoos, LarRy.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.350
Are you sure
they came in here?

12:46.430 --> 12:49.220
Don't question my logic,
Loosie Goosie.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.810
( dance music playing )

13:06.150 --> 13:07.410
Oh, no.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.450
Oh, no, she stole
that move from me.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.520
Hey, Tootsie Roll,
want to give it a go?

13:13.590 --> 13:14.520
Huh.

13:14.590 --> 13:17.080
Oh, now you all up on me

13:17.160 --> 13:19.280
Let me show you how you're
supposed to break it down.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.160
Ho!

13:20.230 --> 13:21.220
Move out of my way.

13:21.290 --> 13:22.520
Clear the dance floor, hos.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.720
Come on, chocolate.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.160
Move back, chocolate.

13:25.230 --> 13:27.360
Oh, y'all know

13:27.430 --> 13:29.370
Back it up more,

13:29.440 --> 13:30.560
Okay.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.260
All right, come on,

13:34.140 --> 13:35.770
The butterfly

15:41.730 --> 15:43.700
# You're in the club
tRying to fight #

15:43.770 --> 15:45.400
# 'Cause you love that ooh #

15:48.110 --> 15:49.230

15:49.310 --> 15:51.140

# Wanna hit you with the #

# The... bass #

16:02.860 --> 16:05.320
# The bass, the bass #

16:05.390 --> 16:07.480
# It's just
the bass, the bass #

16:07.560 --> 16:09.190
# The bass #

16:09.260 --> 16:11.490
# It's just the bass
the bass #

16:11.560 --> 16:13.530
# Bass, bass #

16:13.600 --> 16:15.190
# Like, like, like
you like the bass #

16:15.270 --> 16:17.700
# Bass, bass, bass #

16:17.770 --> 16:19.640
# You, you, you
you like the bass #

16:19.710 --> 16:22.470
# Bass, bass #

16:22.540 --> 16:23.740
# Hey #

16:23.810 --> 16:25.840
# You're in the streets
gettin' rough #

16:25.910 --> 16:27.710
# 'Cause you need that ooh #

16:27.780 --> 16:29.580
# The room goes round
spinning round #

16:29.650 --> 16:31.380
# When you drink that ooh #

16:31.450 --> 16:32.650
# You get kicked out

16:32.720 --> 16:35.280
# 'Cause you're rowdy
when you hear that #

16:35.360 --> 16:37.080
# And you love that #

16:37.160 --> 16:38.380
# You just can't
stop that ##

17:22.099 --> 17:23.859
SorRy.

17:23.940 --> 17:25.400
I'm...

17:25.470 --> 17:29.070
I-- I-- I-- I was just--
just looking at, um...

17:29.140 --> 17:31.130
My tits?

17:31.210 --> 17:33.410
No... I wasn't.

17:33.480 --> 17:38.580
I was-- I-- I was just
looking at your necklace.

17:38.650 --> 17:41.950
It's-- it's really--
it's really pretty.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.790
It... Iooks expensive.

17:45.860 --> 17:46.920
Where'd you get it?

18:11.020 --> 18:12.680
I found it.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.950
Why?

18:15.020 --> 18:17.490
Then why do you wear it?

18:17.560 --> 18:20.960
'Cause, kiddo...

18:21.030 --> 18:24.690
people need to...

18:24.760 --> 18:27.290
feel like they belong to
something in their lives.

18:27.370 --> 18:28.860
You know?

18:28.940 --> 18:31.460
Something bigger than
themselves.

18:31.540 --> 18:35.940
Follow the rules
'cause their parents did.

18:36.010 --> 18:39.500
Be told what to do,
what to believe.

18:39.580 --> 18:41.770
Shit like that, you know?

18:41.850 --> 18:44.610
Basically I wear it so...

18:44.680 --> 18:48.420
I'll fit the fuck in
with eveRybody else.

18:48.490 --> 18:50.580
So...

18:50.660 --> 18:52.680
if I wear one,
then I'll belong, too?

18:57.330 --> 18:59.090
I don't see why the fuck not.

19:03.970 --> 19:05.490
Welcome,
my little stray lamb.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.330
Welcome to salvation.

19:07.410 --> 19:09.810
Today is the last day of your
sinner-life

19:09.880 --> 19:12.170
and the first day of
your new life with Christ,

19:12.250 --> 19:14.810
your Lord and Savior.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.040
So, um, if--

19:17.120 --> 19:19.450
if I join,
I'll belong with you guys?

19:19.520 --> 19:20.650
( giggling )

19:20.720 --> 19:21.780
Of course, silly.

19:21.850 --> 19:23.480
You'll be my sister
in Christ.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.180
Oh, it's so much fun!

19:25.260 --> 19:26.990
And you'll soon learn
that together

19:27.060 --> 19:29.220
we can spread Christ's
love to eveRyone we meet

19:29.300 --> 19:30.820
and bring them to
salvation.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.890
Together.

19:32.970 --> 19:35.400
You-- you--
you really mean it?

19:39.010 --> 19:40.530
Shh now.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.470
I'm not gonna huRt you.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.200
I'm your friend.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.340
What's your name, sweetie?

19:46.410 --> 19:49.040
Sp... Spork.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.850
Well, a-a-actually,
it's more of a nickname.

19:52.920 --> 19:53.720
Hmm.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.080
That's an interesting name.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.380
Why do they
call you that?

20:03.760 --> 20:06.760
( laughing )

20:06.830 --> 20:08.890
What?

20:08.970 --> 20:11.460
Well, "Spark," or...

20:11.540 --> 20:12.970
whatever.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.010
I really don't
think someone like you

20:15.070 --> 20:18.200
would make a veRy good addition
to God's army of goodness.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.680
I mean, really now.

20:19.750 --> 20:22.180
God made man
in his own image,

20:22.250 --> 20:23.610
and I highly doubt that
includes you,

20:23.680 --> 20:24.950
my dear, sweet harlot.

20:25.020 --> 20:27.080
So...

20:29.360 --> 20:30.620
Shut up!

20:52.410 --> 20:53.570
SorRy, Spork.

20:53.650 --> 20:57.210
Just tRying see
if I could cop a feel.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.610
Please don't touch me.

21:02.190 --> 21:03.020
( children laughing )

21:03.090 --> 21:04.220
That's enough.

21:04.290 --> 21:05.480
You brats!

21:05.560 --> 21:08.150
Now show some "ratitude."

21:08.230 --> 21:11.160
There will be a test
later on this week.

21:11.230 --> 21:15.000
And none of you
can afford to fail.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.500
All right.

21:16.570 --> 21:19.470
Now this here is the uterus,

21:19.540 --> 21:22.870
in which the fetal canal carries
a child upon biRth.

21:22.940 --> 21:24.270
( sighing )

21:24.340 --> 21:26.610
Can anyone tell me what we
learned in chapter one

21:26.680 --> 21:29.270
about another
way to give biRth?

21:29.350 --> 21:30.580
Yeah, from your ass.

21:30.650 --> 21:32.080
( children laughing )

21:32.150 --> 21:33.980
Maybe yours,
you little faiRy.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.020
No.

21:39.090 --> 21:42.320
Actually, there has never been
a case in which one was born

21:42.400 --> 21:45.060
out of another's anus.

21:45.130 --> 21:48.000
In any event,
the male reproductive organs

21:48.070 --> 21:53.200
play just as impoRtant a role
as the female's.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.400
ObseRve.

21:55.470 --> 21:59.770
Here we have the penis.

21:59.850 --> 22:03.410
Within the penis
is the urethra.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.380
It's also...

22:40.120 --> 22:41.780
( school bell ringing )

22:48.030 --> 22:49.090
Hey, Spork.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.360
You know, you shouldn't
be upset.

22:51.430 --> 22:52.660
I mean, trust me.

22:52.730 --> 22:55.170
People always knock me
because I have two gay dads.

22:55.230 --> 22:57.000
Like, screw them, man.

22:57.070 --> 22:58.200
I'm proud of
my gay parents.

22:58.270 --> 23:00.200
And you should be proud of
being a lesbian.

23:00.270 --> 23:02.140
I'm not a lesbian, Charlie.

23:02.210 --> 23:03.570
Well, whatever you
wanna call it then.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.770
Confused.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.010
I'm not confused either,
Charlie.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.880
Just because you're gay,
doesn't mean eveRybody else is.

23:08.950 --> 23:10.380
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

23:10.450 --> 23:11.420
What?

23:11.480 --> 23:12.950
I said my dads are gay.

23:13.020 --> 23:14.580
I'm not a fuckin'
faggot.

23:14.650 --> 23:15.550
Aw!

23:15.620 --> 23:17.350
Screw you, you mutant.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.020
Watch it, homo.

23:26.730 --> 23:28.460
Look out, ho!

23:28.530 --> 23:29.520
Ooh.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.400
My bad, girl.

23:30.470 --> 23:32.030
I didn't even see you.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.900
Listen, me and my hos are gonna
practice a little booty shakin'.

23:34.970 --> 23:35.960
Why don't you come with us?

23:36.040 --> 23:37.570
I know you ain't
gonna let this white girl

23:37.640 --> 23:39.630
come with us to practice.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.770
You know whiteys
ain't allowed to pop it.

23:41.850 --> 23:44.320
Bitch, silence that hole,
and respect my girl.

23:44.380 --> 23:45.440
Okay?

23:45.520 --> 23:47.150
She is my neighbor,
and I got her back.

23:47.220 --> 23:47.880
Hear that?

23:47.950 --> 23:49.920
Mmm, come on, let's go.

23:49.990 --> 23:50.790
Come on, Spork.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.480
# Ding-ding-ding-a-ling #

23:52.560 --> 23:53.960
# Ding-a-ling #

23:54.030 --> 23:55.790
Spork, let's go!

23:55.860 --> 23:57.160
# Ding-a-ling #

23:57.230 --> 23:59.200
# Ding-ding-ding-a-ling #

23:59.270 --> 24:00.600
# Ding-a-ling #

24:00.670 --> 24:02.530
# Shake your
ding-a-ling #

24:02.600 --> 24:03.830
# Ding-a-ling #

24:03.900 --> 24:05.870
# Shake your
ding-a-ling #

24:05.940 --> 24:07.200
# Ding-a-ling #

24:07.270 --> 24:09.330
# Shake your
ding-a-ling #

24:09.410 --> 24:10.670
# Ding-a-ling #

24:10.740 --> 24:12.510
# Ding-ding-ding-a-ling #

24:12.580 --> 24:13.810
# Hey little thing #

24:13.880 --> 24:14.970
# Shake that
ding-a-ling #

24:15.050 --> 24:16.240
# Shake, shake it just
don't break it #

24:16.320 --> 24:18.010
# Hey little thing
shake that ding-a-ling #

24:18.080 --> 24:19.680
# Don't fake it move 'til you
make it #

24:19.750 --> 24:21.620
# Hey little thing
shake that ding-a-ling #

24:21.690 --> 24:22.920
# Shake, shake it just
don't break it #

24:22.990 --> 24:24.850
# Hey little thing
shake that ding-a-ling #

24:24.920 --> 24:26.860
# D-d-ding-a-ling #

24:26.930 --> 24:27.980
# Now left... #

24:29.730 --> 24:31.290
The butterfly
uh-uh that's old

24:31.360 --> 24:34.030
Let me see the Tootsie Roll

24:34.100 --> 24:36.570
Yeah 1994

24:36.640 --> 24:39.830
69 Boyz backed up by
the Quad City D.J.

24:39.910 --> 24:42.140
One time cotton candy
sweet to go

24:42.210 --> 24:44.680
Let me see that Tootsie Roll

24:44.740 --> 24:46.230
Come on, come on
Tootsie Roll

24:46.310 --> 24:48.250
Just make
that Tootsie Roll

24:48.310 --> 24:49.650
Here we go Tootsie Roll

24:49.720 --> 24:51.810
Just make that
Tootsie Roll

24:51.880 --> 24:53.550
Yeah Tootsie Roll

24:53.620 --> 24:55.520
Let me see that
Tootsie Roll

24:55.590 --> 24:56.890
Tootsie Roll

24:56.960 --> 24:58.550
Make that Tootsie Roll

24:58.620 --> 25:00.020
To the left, to the left

25:00.090 --> 25:01.720
To the right
to the right

25:01.790 --> 25:03.560
To the front, to the front

25:03.630 --> 25:05.030
To the back
to the back

25:05.100 --> 25:06.430
Don't be-- Oh!

25:06.500 --> 25:08.400
Girl, you're gonna have to
turn your head that way.

25:08.470 --> 25:11.660
... Just slide baby slide
just slide baby slide

25:11.740 --> 25:12.700
Come on, come on

25:12.770 --> 25:14.260
To the left, to the left

25:14.340 --> 25:15.140
To the right...

25:15.210 --> 25:17.470
Oh, shit, oh!

25:17.540 --> 25:19.270
Damn!

25:19.350 --> 25:22.010
That shit must've "huRted"
for "reals."

25:22.080 --> 25:22.980
You okay?

25:23.050 --> 25:24.540
Ouch.

25:26.350 --> 25:29.190
Ow, ow, damn.

25:29.260 --> 25:31.120
Ow, watch it, Spork.

25:31.190 --> 25:33.420
Damn, you know my shit is
busted.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.760
I-- I-- I'm sorRy.

25:35.830 --> 25:37.460
Why you sorRy?

25:37.530 --> 25:39.620
It was my damn fault I didn't
rinse all that Afro Sheen

25:39.700 --> 25:41.560
before I went
and acted a fool.

25:51.010 --> 25:53.040
You were amazing,
by the way.

25:53.110 --> 25:57.280
I mean...
the way you dance, it--

25:57.350 --> 26:01.220
It was like no other kind of
dancing I've ever seen.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.920
Does it huRt?

26:06.930 --> 26:08.330
Not like this.

26:11.300 --> 26:14.760
Usually it's like...

26:14.830 --> 26:19.100
it's like I'm not
Tootsie Roll no more.

26:19.170 --> 26:22.040
Like I'm some other
person...

26:22.110 --> 26:25.240
doing my thing.

26:25.310 --> 26:28.510
Somewhere far, far away
from this shithole.

26:30.950 --> 26:34.410
And I can be
anybody I wanna be.

26:34.490 --> 26:35.650
You know?

26:37.760 --> 26:40.320
"Anyhoo," I'm over this shit.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.690
I don't wanna
see my daddy no way.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.490
He's probably busy and all
tRying to hold down the Bloods.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.830
He's their leader
on the inside.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.960
- You know?
- Wow.

26:52.040 --> 26:55.730
He sounds impoRtant.

26:55.810 --> 27:00.110
Well, what-- what if--
what if one of your friends

27:00.180 --> 27:02.310
could do the dance-off
for you...

27:02.380 --> 27:04.440
and give you the money?

27:04.520 --> 27:09.080
Girl, what kind of world
is you livin' in?

27:09.150 --> 27:11.090
Ain't no girls of mine
gonna give me no money

27:11.160 --> 27:13.820
to see my daddy.

27:13.890 --> 27:16.220
They got
their own dreams.

27:16.300 --> 27:19.290
But-- but, I mean, if they're
your real friends--

27:19.370 --> 27:20.890
I got no real friends, okay?

27:20.970 --> 27:21.900
None of us do.

27:21.970 --> 27:23.800
That's the way
it is in the hood.

27:23.870 --> 27:24.530
You know that.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.070
You live here, too.

27:27.140 --> 27:29.770
I mean, Spork, who you know that
would do that for you, girl?

27:35.050 --> 27:39.010
I don't know.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.210
No one, I guess.

27:48.530 --> 27:50.430
Ooh, girl.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.490
You just saw
a shooting star.

27:53.570 --> 27:56.000
Make a wish, Spork.

27:56.070 --> 27:58.160
Damn, I hope you made a wish
for both of us.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.140
'Cause I'm definitely
getting up outta here

28:02.210 --> 28:03.640
when I'm all grown-up like.

28:04.680 --> 28:07.740
Girl, get your ghetto broke ass
in this house right now.

28:07.810 --> 28:09.510
It's way past
your bedtime.

28:13.220 --> 28:16.190
All right, I gotta bounce.

28:16.260 --> 28:17.880
Thanks for
helping me home, Spork.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.120
No problem.

28:19.190 --> 28:21.250
I'm right next door
if you need me.

28:21.330 --> 28:23.060
Yeah, okay.

28:23.130 --> 28:24.990
Later, chickenhead.

28:25.060 --> 28:26.590
You keep playing
with that he-boy-she-boy,

28:26.670 --> 28:28.060
you're gonna fuck around
and grow a ding-a-ling.

28:28.130 --> 28:29.430
Get in here.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.560
- What's wrong with you?
- Mom!

28:30.640 --> 28:31.630
Shut up, damn!

28:31.700 --> 28:34.070
I read that on TV,
I read it on TV!

28:42.010 --> 28:45.180
Spork: This is
where my mommy sleeps.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.880
Spit didn't have any money to
buRy her proper-like,

28:47.950 --> 28:50.620
so we put her back here

28:50.690 --> 28:53.890
until we get some
money to do it right.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.050
When our dog Buster died,

28:56.130 --> 28:58.960
Spit tried to
throw him in the garbage,

28:59.030 --> 29:01.430
but I pulled him out
and kept him.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.160
Spit said he
doesn't care neither way,

29:03.240 --> 29:04.930
'cause Buster was
better off dead

29:05.000 --> 29:08.560
and Mom was just a stupid whore
who left us like daddy did.

29:08.640 --> 29:13.370
But... sometimes
I hear Spit late at night,

29:13.450 --> 29:16.740
coming out here and
talking to her.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.840
I even heard him cRy once,

29:18.920 --> 29:20.480
though he'd die before
he'd admit it.

29:23.460 --> 29:27.760
When I dream some nights,
I see her.

29:27.830 --> 29:30.760
She has long,
flowing brown hair

29:30.830 --> 29:33.260
and big green-blue eyes,

29:33.330 --> 29:38.240
Iike one of those pretty ladies
on infomercials late at night.

29:38.300 --> 29:40.430
I used to lay right up
against the stone at night

29:40.510 --> 29:43.240
when I couldn't sleep.

29:43.310 --> 29:46.110
Pretend she was there
laying with me.

29:46.180 --> 29:48.010
But now there's
all these weeds over her stone

29:48.080 --> 29:50.450
that I'm allergic to.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.640
Had to go to
the hospital once even.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.240
Said I would have died if I
stayed around them long enough.

30:03.530 --> 30:05.330
woman: Are you
tired of being you?

30:06.930 --> 30:08.520
Then wake up!

30:09.670 --> 30:11.660
Mama?

30:11.740 --> 30:12.900
That's right.

30:12.970 --> 30:16.910
I am here to
help you be the real you.

30:16.980 --> 30:20.500
Are you tired of feeling down,
being laughed at?

30:20.580 --> 30:22.140
Well, so was I.

30:22.210 --> 30:23.550
I know it's hard to believe,

30:23.620 --> 30:27.110
but, yes,
I was once ugly like you.

30:27.190 --> 30:28.680
I, too, was like you--

30:28.750 --> 30:32.620
alone, ugly, ethnic-looking
and sad.

30:32.690 --> 30:34.450
You too, Mommy?

30:34.530 --> 30:35.960
But not anymore!

30:36.030 --> 30:37.960
Since Thermo Ball Blasting
Technique,

30:38.030 --> 30:41.930
I've lost over
150 pounds in just five days!

30:42.000 --> 30:44.660
With little or no scarring,
and minimal heart failure,

30:44.740 --> 30:46.600
I feel great now!

30:46.670 --> 30:48.500
Get off me, Buster!

30:49.980 --> 30:51.410
It is you, Mommy!

30:55.650 --> 30:57.710
This can make me
a real girl.

30:57.780 --> 30:59.680
A pretty girl
like you, Mommy.

30:59.750 --> 31:01.280
So call now.

31:01.350 --> 31:04.720
Your dreams can
come true for you.

31:04.790 --> 31:07.660
All you have to do
is dream them.

31:07.730 --> 31:10.660
Financing is
available at only 200 down.

31:10.730 --> 31:12.700
What are you waiting for?

31:12.760 --> 31:14.230
The new world order
is coming.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.360
Call now!

31:16.440 --> 31:17.870
The dance-off prize.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.810
Thank you, Mommy.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.010
Thank you.

31:56.580 --> 31:57.910
( whistle blowing )

32:00.380 --> 32:02.240
All right, fellas,
come on, line up, quick.

32:02.310 --> 32:03.580
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

32:03.650 --> 32:06.520
All right, shiRts, skins,
shiRts, ski--

32:06.590 --> 32:08.050
Hey.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.150
Hey, Twinkle Toes.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.750
Let's see that
body of yours.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.930
( snickering )

32:18.000 --> 32:20.120
Oh, my God,
look at this fag.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.670
Looks like he's dead, bro.

32:21.730 --> 32:24.170
- Are all fags this white, bro?
- It's major.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.360
Come on, dudes.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.230
I get pussy all the time.

32:27.310 --> 32:29.070
Just don't wanna wrinkle
at a young age.

32:29.140 --> 32:30.540
SPF, bros.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.150
Hey, Sporky, wait up.

32:41.220 --> 32:44.480
Listen, I'm sorRy for being
such a fag earlier.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.390
Don't say that word.

32:47.460 --> 32:48.430
Why not?

32:48.490 --> 32:50.480
It's only mean
if you're a fag.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.460
It's mean no matter what,
Charlie.

32:52.530 --> 32:55.400
Okay... I'm sorRy.

32:55.470 --> 32:56.460
Listen.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.260
I saw you on
the dance-off list.

32:58.340 --> 32:59.360
I can't believe it.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.070
What are you
gonna do?

33:01.140 --> 33:03.160
I... I don't know.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.510
I mean, I-- I haven't really
thought about it yet.

33:06.580 --> 33:07.880
Didn't sign myself up.

33:07.950 --> 33:09.410
I'm not really
a dancer.

33:09.480 --> 33:12.250
But, literally, I know all
the Justin Timberlake moves

33:12.320 --> 33:13.650
by heaRt.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.690
So, tell me
if you need any help.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.020
Thanks, Charlie.

33:18.090 --> 33:19.220
- Let's go.
- Oh, my God, they're coming.

33:19.290 --> 33:20.990
Alli vienen las bitches!

33:24.860 --> 33:26.920
# Is it 'cause
I'm cool? #

33:27.000 --> 33:29.060
# Why you dress like me? #

33:29.130 --> 33:32.570
# Is it honesty
or you just a fool? #

33:32.640 --> 33:34.970
# Is it 'cause I'm cool? #

33:35.040 --> 33:37.030
# Why the schoolkids
laugh #

33:37.110 --> 33:40.640
# 'Cause the papers
got it wrong again #

33:40.710 --> 33:43.040
# Is it 'cause I'm cool? #

33:43.120 --> 33:45.110
# Take a piece
of me #

33:45.180 --> 33:47.150
# SeRve me up
on a plate #

33:47.220 --> 33:48.850
# In your restaurant #

33:48.920 --> 33:52.080
# Is it 'cause I'm cool? #

33:53.160 --> 33:55.960
# Is it 'cause
I'm cool? #

33:57.300 --> 33:59.350
# Is it 'cause I'm fly? #

33:59.430 --> 34:01.400
# 'Cause I said
what I said #

34:01.470 --> 34:03.400
# When I said what I said #

34:03.470 --> 34:05.200
# But I didn't say #

34:05.270 --> 34:07.530
# Is it 'cause I'm hip? #

34:07.610 --> 34:11.600
# Why you dig my shit
and you say I'm a fan #

34:11.679 --> 34:13.270
# Now I understand #

34:13.350 --> 34:15.580
# Is it 'cause I'm hot? #

34:15.650 --> 34:17.639
# Why you mention me #

34:17.719 --> 34:21.380
# In your
VIP memoRy #

34:21.449 --> 34:23.679
# Is it 'cause I'm cool? #

34:25.590 --> 34:29.120
# No one really
cooler ##

34:36.100 --> 34:37.900
Oh, well, if it isn't
the little she-he

34:37.969 --> 34:39.460
and the amazing Faggotron.

34:39.540 --> 34:40.940
Shut up, Byotch.

34:41.010 --> 34:42.909
You're just mad 'cause I took
your virginity and dumped you.

34:44.679 --> 34:45.940
Please.

34:46.010 --> 34:49.449
You couldn't get it up
if your daddies asked you to.

34:49.510 --> 34:51.850
And I'm sure they do.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.679
By the way, nice eye shadow,
Twinkle Toes.

34:54.750 --> 34:55.810
So your color.

34:55.889 --> 34:57.290
( laughing )

34:57.360 --> 35:00.260
# Hit me baby
one more time #

35:00.330 --> 35:01.920
Ooh, ooh!

35:01.990 --> 35:03.090
That's not even Timberlake.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.530
That's stupid Britney Spears,
a-holes.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.000
Don't you dare

35:08.070 --> 35:10.160
tell me about
Britney Spears.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.670
She is a god to me,
you maggot.

35:13.740 --> 35:17.000
Why don't-- why don't you
just leave him alone, Betsy?

35:17.080 --> 35:19.370
Hmm, so "it" speaks.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.410
I've been waiting for this for
some time now.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.410
You and I have
a little unfinished business

35:23.480 --> 35:24.850
to do, he-she!

35:26.950 --> 35:28.350
Don't do it, Spork.

35:28.420 --> 35:31.910
If you get in trouble, you won't
be allowed to do the dance-off.

35:31.990 --> 35:33.480
Well, well, well.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.860
So, Sporky the Dorky
thinks that she has a shot

35:35.930 --> 35:37.950
at winning my dance-off, huh?

35:38.030 --> 35:40.020
It's not your dance-off,
Byotch.

35:40.100 --> 35:42.360
Oh, but it
will be, sister.

35:42.430 --> 35:43.900
It will be.

35:43.970 --> 35:46.100
Hey, you funny-lookin'
little white girls!

35:46.170 --> 35:47.260
That's enough of that.

35:47.340 --> 35:49.710
Get your little skinny asses
to class, pronto!

35:49.770 --> 35:51.140
And that means you too, Spork.

35:55.010 --> 35:57.040
( laughing )

36:01.950 --> 36:03.180
Meet me after school tomorrow.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.280
I'll teach you all I know about
Justin Timberlake.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.880
There's no way
you're gonna lose.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.630
Oh.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.460
Hey, Chunk.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.830
Hey, Spork.

36:18.900 --> 36:22.970
So, um, thanks for
the advice the other day.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.630
It kind of changed my life.

36:27.110 --> 36:28.510
So I heard.

36:28.580 --> 36:30.710
Got Betsy Byotch
dead in the face.

36:30.780 --> 36:32.580
Pretty fuckin' rad.

36:32.650 --> 36:34.780
( dance music playing )

36:39.290 --> 36:41.520
Chunk?

36:41.590 --> 36:43.250
Hey, were you
just gonna ride home,

36:43.330 --> 36:44.850
or do you have time to hang?

36:44.930 --> 36:46.920
Could maybe come
with me to my mom's restaurant

36:47.000 --> 36:48.690
and help out in exchange for
some more advice.

36:50.840 --> 36:51.820
( horn honking )

36:58.680 --> 36:59.700
Holla!

37:06.750 --> 37:08.810
So...

37:08.890 --> 37:12.690
this is where
you work after school?

37:12.760 --> 37:13.920
Kinda.

37:13.990 --> 37:15.580
It's not like work-work.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.650
I don't get paid
or anything.

37:17.730 --> 37:19.920
I just fill out these little
papers with sayings and shit.

37:25.470 --> 37:26.530
"Never take for granted

37:26.610 --> 37:29.370
the things that matter
least in life."

37:29.440 --> 37:30.770
My mom has me
help her with writing out

37:30.840 --> 37:33.740
all the foRtune cookies.

37:33.810 --> 37:35.940
- By hand?
- "Yeppers."

37:36.010 --> 37:38.210
Cheaper, it keeps me busy
and out of trouble.

37:42.090 --> 37:44.490
So, Spork, word is you're
hangin' with Twinkle Toes

37:44.560 --> 37:46.620
and gearing up to tRy and win
the dance-off.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.220
Don't be neRvous, kiddo.

37:51.300 --> 37:52.420
You just keep doing
what you're doing,

37:52.500 --> 37:54.860
no matter what anyone says.

37:54.930 --> 37:58.230
Charlie, the dance-off--
none of it really matters.

37:58.300 --> 38:00.330
All that matters is that you
give both a shot.

38:00.410 --> 38:01.600
You hear me?

38:01.670 --> 38:03.800
( woman speaking Mandarin )

38:23.300 --> 38:25.260
Wh-- what was she saying,
Chunk?

38:27.870 --> 38:29.600
She said you look
pretty dressed like that.

38:40.150 --> 38:41.310
( dog barking )

38:44.350 --> 38:45.480
# Hey #

38:47.520 --> 38:48.780
# Hey #

38:52.920 --> 38:55.450
# Hey ##

38:55.530 --> 38:57.890
Hey, Spit, can I talk to you
for a minute?

38:57.960 --> 38:59.520
What's up, kiddo?

39:01.600 --> 39:05.800
Well, if you liked
somebody, what would you do?

39:05.870 --> 39:07.740
Are you pregnant, Spork?

39:07.810 --> 39:09.240
No, Spit.

39:09.310 --> 39:12.110
Did you get someone
pregnant, Spork?

39:12.180 --> 39:14.580
No, Spit.

39:14.650 --> 39:18.010
Well, then, I guess
I'd probably tell 'em.

39:20.150 --> 39:22.240
But tell them what?

39:22.320 --> 39:23.980
That I wanted to
get 'em pregnant.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.260
Look, Spork...

39:30.330 --> 39:32.990
it just happens, you know.

39:33.060 --> 39:35.190
Like...

39:35.270 --> 39:38.960
when you're with someone,
it just happens or it don't.

39:39.040 --> 39:42.470
There ain't no special words
or nothin' like that.

39:42.540 --> 39:45.910
It's like, uh, us guys,

39:45.980 --> 39:48.340
we just follow our dicks,
and you girls--

39:48.410 --> 39:51.280
- Never mind, Spit.
- Oh.

39:51.350 --> 39:54.150
I was gonna say...

39:54.220 --> 39:56.080
you girls
follow your heaRts.

40:28.890 --> 40:30.290
Hey, come here, kiddo.

40:32.290 --> 40:33.450
Take this.

40:35.860 --> 40:36.880
It'll help.

40:43.870 --> 40:44.990
( sighing )

41:01.150 --> 41:02.380
# One, two, three #

41:02.450 --> 41:04.320
# So I woke up
early this morning #

41:04.390 --> 41:06.290
# And I walked to the
five-and-dime #

41:06.360 --> 41:07.920
# I saw this young lady #

41:07.990 --> 41:10.120
# That's what she looked like
from behind #

41:10.200 --> 41:11.130
# I tapped her
on the shoulder #

41:11.200 --> 41:12.360
She's weird.

41:12.430 --> 41:13.860
# Excuse me, ma'am #

41:13.930 --> 41:15.800
# She looked back at me
and said #

41:15.870 --> 41:17.840
# I'm half-man #

41:17.900 --> 41:22.340
# Whoa #

41:22.410 --> 41:23.310
# Spork #

41:23.370 --> 41:24.200
# Phew #

41:24.280 --> 41:25.170
# That girl #

41:25.240 --> 41:29.650
# Whoa #

41:29.710 --> 41:30.580
# Spork #

41:30.650 --> 41:31.480
# Phew #

41:31.550 --> 41:32.710
# That girl #

41:32.780 --> 41:34.340
# That-that-that-that-that
that-that girl #

41:34.420 --> 41:36.110
# That-that-that-that-that
that-that girl #

41:36.190 --> 41:38.120
# That-that-that-that-that
that-that-that-that-that #

41:38.190 --> 41:39.180
# That-that girl #

41:39.260 --> 41:40.250
# Spork ##

41:40.330 --> 41:42.730
( phone ringing )

41:43.930 --> 41:44.900
Y'ello?

41:44.960 --> 41:47.560
I have a favor
to ask you, okay?

41:47.630 --> 41:50.260
And-- and please say yes,
please.

41:50.340 --> 41:52.960
Well, that
depending on what it be.

41:53.040 --> 41:58.000
Um, can you teach me
to dance?

41:58.080 --> 41:59.770
Dance like you do?

41:59.840 --> 42:01.900
I'm-- I'm competing in
the school dance-off,

42:01.980 --> 42:05.470
and I don't think I've ever
danced in my entire life.

42:09.450 --> 42:12.480
Girl, you must be trippin'.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.290
Of course I'll help you,
you my girl.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.590
I am?

42:15.660 --> 42:16.850
Yeah.

42:16.930 --> 42:19.160
You brought my broke ass home,
didn't ya?

42:19.230 --> 42:21.100
But I thought you said
that we didn't have any friends

42:21.170 --> 42:22.030
in the hood.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.130
Spork, I said I'd help.

42:24.200 --> 42:27.000
This ain't no Oprah,
so shut the hell up.

42:27.070 --> 42:29.160
Come by the gymnasium tomorrow
during lunch.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.230
Me and my hos
will hook you up.

42:31.310 --> 42:32.370
Thanks, Tootsie Roll.

42:32.440 --> 42:33.380
Oh, and Spork?

42:33.440 --> 42:35.240
Wear sneakers.

42:35.310 --> 42:36.610
Okay.

42:48.890 --> 42:50.620
We can do this, Dorothy.

42:52.760 --> 42:54.030
We can do this.

42:55.100 --> 42:57.660
Okay, now, Treena, show Spork
the dookie dump.

42:57.740 --> 42:59.030
Girl, you better
ask somebody.

42:59.100 --> 43:00.430
Mm-hmm.

43:03.440 --> 43:04.370
# Hit it #

43:12.280 --> 43:13.650
Now this is
the dookie dump.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.690
Okay, now, Spork,
you tRy the dookie dump.

43:19.760 --> 43:22.620
# It was me
and the posse with... #

43:22.690 --> 43:24.690
Um...

43:24.760 --> 43:25.660
I'm-- I'm--

43:25.730 --> 43:26.890
Damn, bitch!

43:26.970 --> 43:28.260
Do like I say.

43:28.330 --> 43:31.430
# Lo and behold there
appeared a mirage #

43:31.500 --> 43:35.940
# He was hooking up a car
in his daddy's garage #

43:36.010 --> 43:37.530
# We stopped short #

43:37.610 --> 43:38.580
Oh!

43:38.640 --> 43:39.670
# Did a double take #

43:39.740 --> 43:42.740
Th-that's it, girl,
you almost got it.

43:42.810 --> 43:44.870
Okay, now tRy to
stick your ass out more.

43:45.650 --> 43:47.210
( laughing )

43:47.290 --> 43:49.550
N-no, no, no.

43:49.620 --> 43:50.650
Like this.

43:53.360 --> 43:55.880
Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom.

43:55.960 --> 43:57.890
No, honey.

43:57.960 --> 44:00.290
You need to move it,
rock your hips.

44:00.370 --> 44:03.060
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

44:05.770 --> 44:07.800
Little-- little
bit better, but...

44:07.870 --> 44:09.310
Yeah.

44:09.370 --> 44:10.600
That's it, girl.

44:10.680 --> 44:11.730
Now let's tRy this.

44:11.810 --> 44:13.000
Move it to the side.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.540
Okay, girl.

44:17.820 --> 44:19.250
Go, girl.

44:21.790 --> 44:23.480
You've gotta be kidding me.

44:23.550 --> 44:26.150
They're teaching her
how to dance?

44:26.220 --> 44:28.160
If you could call it that.

44:28.230 --> 44:30.660
Looks more like
some tribal ritual.

44:30.730 --> 44:34.630
I hope she's the sacrifice.

44:34.700 --> 44:37.830
I just got an idea.

44:37.900 --> 44:42.030
Let's go ahead and allow
Sporky Dorky to compete.

44:42.110 --> 44:44.470
It might just be the best
peRformance yet.

44:46.910 --> 44:49.040
( giggling )

44:49.110 --> 44:51.510
You are so
over-the-top sometimes.

44:56.820 --> 44:58.650
Hey, Spork.

44:58.720 --> 44:59.920
Hey, Charlie.

44:59.990 --> 45:01.790
You ready?

45:01.860 --> 45:04.230
I don't know.

45:04.300 --> 45:06.320
Tootsie Roll tried to teach me
during lunch,

45:06.400 --> 45:10.300
but I just can't
get my ass to move like hers.

45:10.370 --> 45:12.000
( chuckling )

45:12.070 --> 45:13.130
Come on, Spork.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.830
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

45:14.910 --> 45:17.240
I'll teach you all I know.

45:17.310 --> 45:18.800
I have the whole
DVD collection

45:18.880 --> 45:21.500
of all the Justin Timberlake
conceRts.

45:21.580 --> 45:23.670
He'll show us what to do.

45:23.750 --> 45:24.910
Come on!

45:35.890 --> 45:37.790
( dance music playing )

45:39.930 --> 45:41.870
Okay, Spork, watch.

45:41.930 --> 45:43.370
Watch.

45:43.430 --> 45:44.230
There!

45:44.300 --> 45:45.960
Did you just see that?

45:46.040 --> 45:49.500
Oh, my God,
he's so utterly amazing.

45:49.570 --> 45:52.630
Did you know he's actually
a natural blonde?

45:54.410 --> 45:56.570
Oh, my God.

45:56.650 --> 45:59.410
You know Dorothy?

45:59.480 --> 46:02.250
Hmm, yeah.

46:02.320 --> 46:04.950
My mom got that for me
for my biRthday.

46:05.020 --> 46:07.250
Pretty stupid, I know.

46:07.330 --> 46:11.160
But it...
Iooks different.

46:11.230 --> 46:13.160
And...

46:13.230 --> 46:14.890
why is Dorothy white?

46:14.970 --> 46:18.660
And where's
the city skyline?

46:18.740 --> 46:21.730
Spork, you're talking about
"The Wiz."

46:21.810 --> 46:24.740
That's the black version.

46:24.810 --> 46:27.110
Oh.

46:27.180 --> 46:29.080
Really?

46:29.150 --> 46:32.450
Wow, I-- I never knew.

46:34.250 --> 46:35.690
That's... that's weird.

46:35.750 --> 46:39.950
I have the same exact poster on
my wall, except...

46:40.020 --> 46:42.420
"The Wiz" poster.

46:42.490 --> 46:43.930
That's my favorite movie.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.720
I've never seen
"The Wiz,"

46:45.800 --> 46:50.390
but that one right there,
that's my favorite movie.

46:50.470 --> 46:53.100
Sometimes I pretend I'm Dorothy,
and I sing.

46:54.610 --> 46:57.670
# Troubles melt
like lemon drops #

46:57.740 --> 47:00.640
# Far above the chimney tops #

47:00.710 --> 47:02.470
# That's where #

47:02.550 --> 47:07.140
# You'll find me ##

47:09.790 --> 47:11.120
Wow.

47:11.190 --> 47:15.180
I never knew I'd tell anyone
that before.

47:15.260 --> 47:16.990
Me neither.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.190
My mom, when I was four,

47:20.260 --> 47:23.130
went to go see
the Land of Oz.

47:23.200 --> 47:24.930
I was mad at her, 'cause she
wouldn't take me,

47:25.000 --> 47:27.030
but...

47:27.100 --> 47:30.440
now I know that
she's happier over there.

47:30.510 --> 47:32.670
See, she's like Dorothy.

47:32.740 --> 47:34.070
She wants to
help eveRyone,

47:34.150 --> 47:39.080
so she's gonna stay in Oz so she
can help people.

47:39.150 --> 47:44.280
She has friends like
Michael Jackson, Tin Man.

47:44.360 --> 47:47.810
You know... friends.

47:47.890 --> 47:49.690
But I don't-- I don't even think
she's looking for

47:49.760 --> 47:51.960
the Wiz anymore.

47:52.030 --> 47:55.190
She's probably happy.

47:55.270 --> 47:58.290
I'm gonna go there
soon too.

47:58.370 --> 48:01.300
I'll... take you
with me, if you want.

48:04.710 --> 48:06.570
I-- I-- I mean, you don't
have to.

48:06.640 --> 48:08.410
I just--
I mean, if you wanted to--

48:08.480 --> 48:11.450
Spork.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.070
Dorothy's black.

48:17.420 --> 48:20.250
So what?

48:20.320 --> 48:21.620
Maybe my mom is black.

48:21.690 --> 48:22.890
You don't know.

48:22.960 --> 48:26.360
Maybe-- maybe in Oz,
you turn black.

48:26.430 --> 48:28.330
I'm just sayin'.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.990
I mean, I wouldn't
mind being black.

48:33.240 --> 48:34.700
That's not the point.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.470
You're weird.

48:42.150 --> 48:43.880
I want to go home.

48:43.950 --> 48:45.210
Wait.

48:45.280 --> 48:46.410
Don't go.

48:55.760 --> 48:57.250
What's your favorite color?

48:59.060 --> 49:01.050
- Green.
- Why?

49:05.740 --> 49:08.140
Because without the green ones,
they're boring.

49:09.610 --> 49:13.300
Yeah, they are kind of boring
without the green ones.

49:13.380 --> 49:15.110
They all kinda look the same.

49:29.160 --> 49:31.290
Is it true?

49:31.360 --> 49:32.690
Is what true?

49:38.100 --> 49:41.970
I wanna go home.

49:42.040 --> 49:43.840
Then go.

49:43.910 --> 49:48.240
# This heaRt is over
the stars #

49:48.310 --> 49:51.910
# This heaRt
is over the moon #

49:53.450 --> 49:56.010
# But fate is filled... #

49:56.090 --> 49:58.020
Please don't
laugh at me.

50:00.760 --> 50:01.990
I think you're pretty.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.490
Do you think
I'm pretty?

50:18.540 --> 50:20.170
I think
you're veRy pretty.

50:22.310 --> 50:26.720
# They shout aggression
at me #

50:26.780 --> 50:31.590
# This lands there
on the wall #

50:31.660 --> 50:35.790
# This life
is far too... ##

50:39.930 --> 50:43.230
I'm-- I'm gonna win
the dance-off, Mommy.

50:43.300 --> 50:46.270
I don't know how, but...

50:46.340 --> 50:47.900
I'm gonna win.

50:47.970 --> 50:51.100
And I'm gonna use the money to
be pretty like you.

50:53.380 --> 50:55.310
And I made a friend.

50:55.380 --> 50:58.580
A real one
this time.

50:58.650 --> 51:02.140
He's really nice, too.

51:02.220 --> 51:06.380
Mommy,
he's coming with me...

51:06.460 --> 51:09.190
to see you in Oz.

51:09.260 --> 51:12.820
He... he already knew about it
even before I met him,

51:12.900 --> 51:16.530
but... he--

51:16.600 --> 51:19.900
Well-- well, kind of,
but...

51:19.970 --> 51:22.230
it was some
other version.

51:22.310 --> 51:23.800
But it was pretty close.

51:27.340 --> 51:28.400
Thanks, Mommy.

52:00.380 --> 52:01.970
Damn, Spork!

52:02.050 --> 52:04.340
You don't know how to
tell no time?

52:04.420 --> 52:06.010
I'm sorRy.

52:06.080 --> 52:08.850
My book bag broke open,
and I lost one of my books.

52:08.920 --> 52:10.280
( laughing )

52:10.350 --> 52:12.520
Hey, shut them holes,
chickenheads!

52:12.590 --> 52:15.080
Like any of y'all know how
to read a damn book no way!

52:15.160 --> 52:16.720
Mmm.

52:16.790 --> 52:19.320
"Anyhoo,"
you been practicing?

52:19.400 --> 52:21.860
Well, yeah, but...

52:21.930 --> 52:23.590
I just can't do it,
Tootsie Roll.

52:23.670 --> 52:24.960
I practiced all night.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.090
Damn, child!

52:26.170 --> 52:27.660
Ain't you good at anything?

52:30.070 --> 52:33.200
Well, I'm really good
at Twister.

52:33.280 --> 52:36.580
Ooh, girl!

52:36.650 --> 52:38.210
I think I got an idea!

52:41.320 --> 52:42.480
# Supersonic #

52:44.790 --> 52:47.090
# Supersonic #

52:47.160 --> 52:48.460
Okay, here it be, girl.

52:48.530 --> 52:49.960
I'm fittin' to
yell out these colors,

52:50.030 --> 52:51.590
and you just gonna do
your thing.

52:51.660 --> 52:52.460
You dig?

52:52.530 --> 52:54.190
Spork: I-- I-- I dig.

52:54.270 --> 52:55.660
Okay, all right then.

52:55.730 --> 52:56.790
So let's do this!

52:56.870 --> 52:57.630
#... rockin'
your world #

52:57.700 --> 52:58.960
# Supersonic #

53:01.110 --> 53:01.700
# Supersonic #

53:01.770 --> 53:03.300
Right hand on red.

53:05.210 --> 53:07.840
Right foot on blue.

53:07.910 --> 53:08.810
Listen...

53:08.880 --> 53:11.070
Right hand on yellow.

53:11.150 --> 53:12.840
Left foot on green.

53:12.920 --> 53:14.380
Right hand on blue.

53:14.450 --> 53:16.010
Left foot on yellow.

53:16.090 --> 53:17.280
Left hand on blue.

53:17.350 --> 53:18.340
Left foot on yellow.

53:18.420 --> 53:20.050
Right hand on green,
left foot on red.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.180
Right foot on yellow.

53:21.260 --> 53:22.560
Green, yellow, red.

53:22.630 --> 53:23.790
Blue, yellow, blue.

53:23.860 --> 53:24.760
Red, red.

53:24.830 --> 53:25.760
R-R-Red.

53:25.830 --> 53:27.320
Yellow, yellow, yellow.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.990
Red, green, red, yellow, blue,
red, yellow, green.

53:30.070 --> 53:32.160
Yellow, red, green.

53:32.240 --> 53:35.140
Red, red, red, green,
yellow, red...

53:40.210 --> 53:42.040
Damn, child.

53:42.110 --> 53:44.100
You just might win this shit
after all, girl.

53:45.380 --> 53:46.310

# Funky, funky

54:57.450 --> 54:59.680
( laughing )

55:04.260 --> 55:07.660
We are about to staRt rehearsals
for the dance-off.

55:10.070 --> 55:12.400
I want each
and eveRy one of you

55:12.470 --> 55:14.530
to understand

55:14.610 --> 55:17.070
that this is
not a competition,

55:17.140 --> 55:20.340
but simply
a means to have fun.

55:20.410 --> 55:23.140
Of course, there will be
a winner

55:23.210 --> 55:26.480
and a whole bunch of losers.

55:26.550 --> 55:29.820
You will be judged by
the audience cheering,

55:29.890 --> 55:33.120
so be sure to invite
all of your friends.

55:33.190 --> 55:37.490
Now, remember, only those
competing can be in here.

55:37.560 --> 55:39.360
The rest of you, wait outside.

55:41.300 --> 55:42.490
Okay.

55:42.570 --> 55:45.730
First up, we have Spork
and Her Only Friends.

55:56.150 --> 55:58.480
My name is Spork
and that's no lie

55:58.550 --> 56:00.980
If you don't like me you
should see my ride

56:02.390 --> 56:04.790
( laughing )

56:06.760 --> 56:09.280
But don't laugh at me
and be such a "meanie"

56:09.360 --> 56:11.950
'Cause I got
a really small wee-wee

56:13.300 --> 56:15.630
( laughing )

56:23.810 --> 56:25.830
Gotcha.

56:25.910 --> 56:27.170
Bitch.

56:27.240 --> 56:29.300
( laughing )

56:31.010 --> 56:32.040
Spork, wait!

56:44.960 --> 56:46.590
Spork, wait!

56:46.660 --> 56:48.260
Don't listen to them!

56:54.970 --> 56:56.770
Hey, girl,
where you runnin' off to?

56:56.840 --> 56:58.240
Hey, I'm talkin'
to you, ho!

56:59.610 --> 57:00.910
( dog barking )

57:00.980 --> 57:01.910
( dog yelping )

57:24.470 --> 57:25.460
Ow!

57:25.540 --> 57:27.130
You stupid ball!

57:27.200 --> 57:29.140
You stupid, stupid ball!

57:29.210 --> 57:30.470
I hate Spork!

57:30.540 --> 57:31.600
I hate her!

57:31.680 --> 57:32.840
And you're dead!

57:32.910 --> 57:34.430
You're not real!

57:34.510 --> 57:36.670
Nothing is real!

57:45.190 --> 57:47.490
( cRying )

58:03.610 --> 58:05.510
Why didn't you
take me with you?

58:05.580 --> 58:07.240
Why, huh?

58:09.250 --> 58:12.080
Why did you
lie to me?

58:12.150 --> 58:15.210
You said I'd be pretty
like you!

58:15.290 --> 58:17.620
I hate you!

58:17.690 --> 58:19.750
I don't want you
to ever come back!

58:19.820 --> 58:23.020
Ever, ever, ever!

58:23.090 --> 58:25.890
I believed you.

58:25.960 --> 58:28.330
Why did you have to
go without me?

58:36.470 --> 58:37.670
I don't wanna
ever wake up.

58:40.210 --> 58:41.940
Never, ever, ever.

59:37.600 --> 59:39.260
Looks like
the champ is up.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.470
What happened?

59:43.540 --> 59:45.870
Well, I think you went and acted
a fool is what happened.

59:57.250 --> 59:58.620
They laughed at me, Spit.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.250
All of them.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.490
I-- I have to move.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:10.930
Go away somewhere.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.730
Where you gonna go?

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.860
Oz?

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:19.470
There is no Oz, Spit.

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.810
Yeah.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.680
I thought
you'd say that.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:28.340
Saw your poster
on the floor.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.480
Still, I figured you
might want it back up

01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:34.250
before you woke up.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.190
I don't.

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.790
Thank you for fixing it,
but it's just a stupid poster.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.490
EveRything is stupid.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.330
Is it now?

01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:55.080
Oh, my God.

01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:59.380
I'm-- I'm not dead.

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.110
But the weeds and...

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:04.310
I'm allergic and--

01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:05.910
Well, last time, I--

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:08.480
That was then, Spork.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.920
People change.

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:12.090
They grow up.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.320
Get stronger.

01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:21.440
I don't.

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:23.740
I won't change.

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.170
I'm just Spork forever.

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:32.650
And what in the hell's wrong
with that, little sis?

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.880
EveRything.

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:38.450
Is it now?

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:42.980
Well, seemed pretty tough
to me last night.

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.290
You could hear me?

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.160
Spork, I think the whole
trailer park could hear you.

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:50.220
Why didn't you
do something?

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.730
I did.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.100
I let you give off some steam,

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:56.330
and there ain't nothin' wrong
with that, Sporky.

01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:58.400
And I'll tell
you something else.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.240
You're more like our mama than
anybody else I ever seen.

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:05.680
What was she like?

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.880
She was like you.

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:18.320
Different.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.020
In more ways than one.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.290
EveRybody thought
she was crazy.

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:28.360
Damn near was,
to tell you the truth.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.930
Scared off Daddy real quick,
I used to think.

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:36.340
But...

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:39.080
she was...

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:41.050
different in a lot of
good ways, too.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.950
Daddy used to
get pretty rough with me.

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:50.120
She'd come a-runnin' out,

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:53.420
hollerin', her hair all
frizzy-like,

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.190
and chase him
off with a shovel.

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.570
That was Mama for you.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.130
And I'll tell you
something else.

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.970
When she was sick,

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:12.310
and you were just a baby,

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.820
she'd always tell me she wasn't
leavin' to go nowhere.

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:19.310
Just to go see Oz.

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:23.290
And that she'd be
waitin' for us there.

01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:29.890
But there is no Oz, Spit.

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:35.230
I've looked,
and she's not there.

01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:37.240
Sporky...

01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:39.280
you just been lookin' in
all the wrong places.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.070
You see, Oz...

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.020
... it's right here.

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.720
And that's where Mama's been
waitin' for you all along.

01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:58.880
She ain't goin' nowhere.

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:04.260
And neither am I, Spork.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.870
All right,
that's enough of that shit.

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:24.510
Clean up this
diRty-ass room.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:28.820
Oh, and wipe your face.

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:30.380
You got
a milk mustache.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.010
SorRy, Dorothy.

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:53.270
I was upset and...

01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:55.110
I didn't mean to
take it out on you.

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:06.320
Oh, my God!

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.520
The dance-off!

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.100
( phone ringing )

01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:18.200
Girl, I can hear you dialing my
number from out the window!

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.840
I need to
ask you another favor.

01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:23.210
Can you help me pick out an
outfit for the dance-off?

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.440
You really
gonna do this?

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:32.380
Definitely.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.220
Well, then come on, ho!

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:35.490
We ain't
got all day!

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.150
I like rainbow sprinkles on my
ice cream pie

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.160
Yeah right

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:40.920
Meet me at
the ice cream truck

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.790
I'll buy you an ice cream

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:44.860
I'll whip out
my drumstick...

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.600
Okay, honestly,
does it look any better?

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:54.370
Do you really want to know?

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.240
I don't seem to remember you
having that attitude

01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:58.540
when I first met you, Loosie.

01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:59.640
I sure hope you haven't
forgotten

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.580
the dark ages, Loosie Goosie.

01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:03.550
You know, before I taught you
the effects of highlights

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.610
and bleached
teeth and eye shadow.

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:07.350
Or do I need to pull out
a photo?

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.390
Glamour Shots
circa '98 much?

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.520
Oh, I'd like to see that.

01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:13.560
You know I've heard about
those photos.

01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:15.190
I'm fine, Byotch.

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:17.700
I'm just totally over your
cunt-fest in the late.

01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:19.700
Like, I love
my bitch points too,

01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:21.740
but you've been acting
all "psycho-fied."

01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:24.470
I mean, that shoe polish
really messed up my pores.

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.530
- Yeah, for sure.
- Def.

01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:29.840
Sacrifices had to be made,
my little second-in-command.

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:30.900
Really?

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.380
'Cause I didn't
see you wearing any.

01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:37.880
Ladies, let's not quarrel
before my--

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:40.550
our... big debut.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.420
Tonight is about
Britney Spears.

01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:44.790
Tonight is the night we show her

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.590
our gratitude for what
she's taught us.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.660
And I know
I've been a bit harsh lately,

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:51.760
but now that Spork is over
and done with,

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.070
Iet's move on and remember
the sisterhood of the bitches.

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.440
And that Spork was just
a taste...

01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:59.480
of my rage.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.210
Now, are you
with me, bitches?

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.270
For sure!

01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:09.920
# We like the cars #

01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:12.080
# The cars
that go boom #

01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:17.990
"Oh, that light is so harsh."

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.890
Blanche DuBois,
Tennessee Williams.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.450
Thank you.

01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:25.430
Welcome, all of you,

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.300
for the biggest moment
in all of your lives,

01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:31.030
and one of mine,

01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:35.370

Dance-Off!

01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:37.210
( cheers and applause )

01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:42.540
Now, I know

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.590
that you are all
as excited as I am

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.890
to see our shining young stars
hit the stage

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.990
and show us
exactly what they're made of.

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:54.890
# Beat, beat, beat, beat #

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.690
# Beat #

01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:57.670
# Hey, hey, hey #

01:07:57.730 --> 01:07:58.890
# Come on eveRybody #

01:07:58.970 --> 01:08:00.060
# Beat ##

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:15.740
So, without fuRther ado,

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:19.620
we kick off
the dance-off first with

01:08:19.689 --> 01:08:23.390
Betsy Byotch
and the Bitches!

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.689
( cheers and applause )

01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:36.960
# Oh baby, baby #

01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:42.109
# Oh baby, baby #

01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:47.540
# Oh baby, baby #

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:50.920
# How was I
supposed to know #

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.890
# That something wasn't
right here #

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.890
# Oh baby, baby #

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.590
# I shouldn't
have let you go #

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.859
# And now you're right out
of sight yeah... #

01:09:11.979 --> 01:09:12.939
Okay, okay.

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:14.140
Move outta my way, hos.

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:15.540
Damn, that's
a big-ass hat.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.479
- Whoo, that's a big-ass hat.
- Stupid hat!

01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:18.710
This ain't no Vegas.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.720
#... is killin' me and I #

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:23.649
# I must confess #

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.550
# I still believe #

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.090
# Still believe #

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.350
# When I'm not with you
I lose my mind #

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:34.189
# Give me a sign #

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.290
# Hit me baby
one more time #

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:40.960
# My loneliness
is killing me #

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.560
Okay, you ready for this?

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.040
A'ight then.

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:46.939
All right, I'm fittin' to be
right here,

01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:48.670
yelling out the orders.

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:51.040
Whatever you do,
don't stop.

01:09:51.109 --> 01:09:54.880
# And give me a sign #

01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:57.480
# Hit me baby
one more time ##

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.520
( cheers and applause )

01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:06.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.220
That was quite a show!

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:12.060
Let's hear it for
Betsy Byotch and the Bitches!

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.190
( cheers and applause )

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:15.400
The little bitches.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.480
You've gotta be
kidding me.

01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:26.140
What are those
things doing here?

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.190
Looks like not eveRybody
is scared of you.

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.580
Oh, uh...

01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:32.350
Okay, okay, quiet now!

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:34.550
Quiet, quiet!

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:38.080
Now, there's been a change in
the schedule,

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.560
apparently, I believe.

01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:43.460
Uh...

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:45.060
Well, yes.

01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:48.660
There's been a change
in the schedule.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.300
Hmm.

01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:54.970
Next up will be
a peRformance given by J--

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.770
( feedback blaring )

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:02.180
What the fuck
is this about?

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.040
# Lady boy, lady boy #

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.380

Damn!

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:13.390
#... everybody's in on it #

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:16.520
# Some girls talk to the boys

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:19.790
# My girls talk to

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.630

( cheers and applause )

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:39.200
Shut up, shut up,
all of you.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.210
Stop it!

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.370
( cheers and applause )

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:57.950
This is all 'cause of you,
Tootsie Roll.

01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.520
Thank you.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.720
Girl, don't even play.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.560
I don't know what the hell you
did out there,

01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:05.730
but it wasn't
for sure nothin' I taught you.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.790
Get it, girl.

01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:08.630
Get it for reals.

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:11.260
( cheers and applause )

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.280
Quiet!

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:17.680
Quiet, quiet!

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:20.380
Quiet, shh!

01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:21.580
Shut up!

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.880
Thank you.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:31.890
Well, I must say, this is
quite a surprise indeed.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.120
In all fairness,

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.930
I think the winner has already
been decided.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.660
Too bad, bunnies.

01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:41.030
This was a real shocker,
wasn't it, kids?

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.830
The winner is...

01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:44.200
( imitating fanfare )

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.570
The winner is Spork!

01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:55.170
( cheers and applause )

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.180
all: Spork, Spork, Spork!

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:07.030
Spork, Spork, Spork,
Spork, Spork, Spork!

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.830
Spork, Spork, Spork,
Spork, Spork!

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.730
Spork, Spork, Spork,
Spork, Spork, Spork, Spork!

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.130
Spork, Spork, Spork, Spork,
Spork, Spork...

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.540
( cheers and applause )

01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:45.420
Tootsie Roll, um, I--

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:46.760
I know you said we're not
supposed to have

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.430
any friends in the hood.

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:52.000
But you're the closest thing
I've ever had to a real friend.

01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:54.740
And...

01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:56.640
I want you to have this.

01:15:56.710 --> 01:15:59.150
Okay?

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.780
Spork, I--
I can't take this.

01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:04.250
You earned it, girl,
you worked hard.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.190
I'm cool.

01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.850
I'm not
worried about that.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.550
I-- I know you're cool.

01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:12.120
But, again,
you're my friend.

01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:15.160
And that's what
friends do.

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:16.930
At least my friends.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.260
It's yours,
you earned it.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.330
Sweet!

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.210
Oh!

01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:31.380
You're the coolest white bitch
I know, Spork.

01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:33.210
- Thanks.
- Hear that, okay?

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.480
Okay.

01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:35.710
Come on, y'all,
let's go.

01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:37.450
- Bye, Spork!
- Bye, Spork!

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.710
Later, Charlie,
bye, Spork.

01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:50.690
This is it, tripod!

01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:52.360
You may have convinced
the school that you're normal,

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.460
but I am so gonna pound
your face in!

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.770
Oh, shut
the fuck up already!

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.700
Jesus.

01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:00.640
You are so drama-rama.

01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:03.110
You know what, bitch?

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:06.640
I have just about had it
with your insubordination.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.840
Uh!

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.880
Shit, dude, that bitch
was so annoying.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.950
Wow, that was amazing.

01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:17.290
The name's Chunk.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.330
Kinda like "chink," but instead
they call me Chunk.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.420
Loosie Goosie.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.660
Kinda like Lucy,
but they call me Loosie.

01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:45.420
So, what you did with
Tootsie Roll and the money--

01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:47.960
that was pretty cool.

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.420
She's my friend.

01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:53.190
That's what friends do.

01:17:56.370 --> 01:17:59.560
Hey, Spork,
can I ask you something?

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.430
Sure.

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:07.340
If you've
never had a friend...

01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:09.310
how do you know what a friend
would do?

01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:16.310
'Cause...

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.790
it just feels right.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.150
Yeah.

01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:26.290
Spork?

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.590
Yeah, Charlie.

01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:33.330
Will you be
my girlfriend?

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.540
Sure.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.440
Yes!

01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:52.610
Spork: And that was
my first boyfriend.

01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:55.160
Made my first friend
and boyfriend

01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.920
in one awesome day.

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:04.660
It's funny, really,
when Charlie asked me

01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:08.400
how I ever really knew what
a good friend would be like.

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:11.630
'Cause I really never did know.

01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:15.370
But there's a lot of things
I still don't really know.

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.810
Why people say mean things

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.580
or huRt other people when
they're different.

01:19:21.850 --> 01:19:23.440
I don't think
I'll ever know.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.280
The truth is...

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:31.880
I don't wanna know.

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.660
'Cause, you see,
it doesn't matter.

01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:38.660
All that matters is the people
we care about

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:40.220
and the ones
who care about us.

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.380
See, Mommy...

01:19:57.450 --> 01:19:58.510
you made it.

01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:02.290
You made it
to the Emerald City.

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:14.530
I used to think that
my only dream

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.540
was to be someone else...

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:18.370
anything else
than what I was.

01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:27.210
And somehow I got it.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.840
I finally figured out
how to be somebody

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.110
I never really ever
got to be in my whole life.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:36.980
Myself.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.860
# Hey #

01:20:43.930 --> 01:20:44.830

# Nobody kisses you

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:02.110
# Pick your boogie #

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:03.880
# Then dance #

01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:05.680
# Pop your booty #

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:07.650
# Throw up your hands #

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:08.990
# You don't hear them #

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:10.890
# When they

# You ain't
got no friends #

# You just came to paRty #

# You just

# When they

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.180
# Ooh you're such a dork #

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.140
# Nobody kisses you
on the dance floor #

01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:32.040
# You just want to join
the paRty #

01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:33.880
# You just

01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:35.750
# You ain't tRying to

01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.720
# You ain't
tRying to make no friends #

01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:41.450
# EveRything and eveRybody
always has to disappear #

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.790
# When you staRt
to feel your body move #

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:45.420
# And you don't even care #

01:21:45.490 --> 01:21:47.160
