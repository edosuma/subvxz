00:01.000 --> 00:02.537
<i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

00:02.628 --> 00:03.628
I need your help.

00:03.711 --> 00:06.024
Those who go into the Mirror World
rarely find their way out.

00:06.048 --> 00:08.151
<i>- Who's in the Mirror World?
- My daughter.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:09.837
What you need to do
is pull her out.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.463
I might have something.

00:11.553 --> 00:14.921
It turns an ordinary object
into, sort of, a beacon.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.803
<i>Thank you, Alice. Truly.</i>

00:17.893 --> 00:20.226
There was some fallout
from your tracker coins.

00:20.312 --> 00:21.348
Several hedges died.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.350
Today we learned
the true danger we're in.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.729
What about Penny?
He still, uh, sweating you?

00:26.818 --> 00:29.060
He's not sweating me.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.861
I was a goddess,
and now, I'm just

00:30.948 --> 00:33.315
your friendly neighborhood
bulletproof vest.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.740
It would be
best for you

00:34.826 --> 00:37.443
that you make this state
you find yourself in, temporary.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.029
Have any advice
on how I do that?

00:39.122 --> 00:40.613
You must seek the Binder.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.948
A monster possessed you

00:42.042 --> 00:43.520
- and is inhabiting your body.
- What?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.980
<i>There's a door hidden deep
in a forgotten remembrance.</i>

00:46.004 --> 00:48.621
Q, it's me. It's Eliot.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.081
I'm alive in here.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.666
Tell me my destiny.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.047
A moment will come to protect
the future of Fillory.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.129
A moment to stand beside
the High King

00:56.223 --> 00:57.589
and then dethrone her.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.140
Take her crown, Fen.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.719
Even if that means
drenching it in her blood.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.808
Hedge witches of the world,
this is your wake up call.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.233
The Library
has turned the flow

01:09.319 --> 01:11.561
of ambient magic
down to a trickle.

01:11.655 --> 01:12.896
We fight for scraps.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.822
It's time to cull the herd.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.168 --> 01:28.457
Defend yourself. Go on.
Throw something at me.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.751
Cast anything...

01:36.430 --> 01:38.296
This is what the worm does.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.053
Try to remove it, same effect.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.851
We will find you.
We will infect you.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.394
You've been warned.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.265
<i>Stop doing magic.
It's not for you.</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:52.105
Fuckers call
themselves "Serpent".

01:52.195 --> 01:53.561
Branding's a 'B' minus,

01:53.655 --> 01:55.442
but they are
very much for real.

01:55.741 --> 01:56.777
Wards are no help.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.074
Last guy was attacked

01:58.160 --> 02:00.868
in broad daylight
in his own kitchen.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.497
Kady, it's Alice.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.922
Can you let me in?
I'm just here to talk.

02:13.008 --> 02:16.092
Oh, good. So, you don't
need the crowbar.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.757
Hi. Go to hell. Bye.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.133
Wait, no, I'm coming in.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.215
So, hit me, or hear me out.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.722
You're trying to
fight the Library.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.811
Yeah, no, I'm not.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.138
They're calling you the new Marina.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.143
Actually, they are
calling you that.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.184
Mostly even in good terms.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.735
Hi. Listen,

02:34.821 --> 02:37.154
we're not trying to step
on the foot of big government.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.440
We're just trying to,
you know,

02:38.575 --> 02:40.316
not die.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.823
But you are doing something.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.404
And I was inside
the Library, okay?

02:44.498 --> 02:45.784
I can help.

02:47.709 --> 02:48.895
Look, I've been
on an apology tour.

02:48.919 --> 02:49.979
Would you like to
hear my speech?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.003
No.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.041
Why do you want to help?

02:53.131 --> 02:54.497
None of us
went on that quest

02:54.591 --> 02:56.127
so good people would

02:56.218 --> 02:58.175
have to be slaves
for the Library

02:58.261 --> 02:59.877
just to get a little magic.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.134
I wanna fix it.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.262
At least help.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.360
I feel better.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.774
So, we're having a crisis.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.901
You can help, you can stay.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.033
Damn.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.903
Hi, my name's Pete,
by the way.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.114
I had no idea hedges
were taking it this far.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.750
So, the Library
turned down the ambient.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.197
- Is that how this started?
- They did more than that.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.666
Mandatory cards, bans,
meters in houses...

03:37.759 --> 03:41.218
And, I've seen those.
What's your plan?

03:41.304 --> 03:42.407
We know this will
keep happening

03:42.431 --> 03:44.218
if everyone's starving.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.008
I helped open
a pipe in Modesto,

03:47.102 --> 03:48.413
but we can't get
anywhere near that right now.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.518
That was you?

03:49.604 --> 03:51.812
Do you have any...

03:51.898 --> 03:53.639
What I... We didn't
blow anything up,

03:53.734 --> 03:56.477
and we definitely didn't know
anybody else would.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.778
You're right.
You can't just open one.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.275
You have to open 50, 100.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.027
Everywhere. You'd need a...

04:04.661 --> 04:07.244
You need a map
of the entire system.

04:09.833 --> 04:10.949
We're listening.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.584
Junction boxes.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.786
Drop a tracer.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.745
Follow the pipe.
Map the system.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.339
Look for weak spots.
Spots with the most magic.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.377
Great, how do we
find a box?

04:24.014 --> 04:25.014
Oh, the one person I knew

04:25.098 --> 04:27.215
who could help us,
the Library took her.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.639
Okay, so, we need another way
to get at a box.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.480
We need a mole.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.273
Recruit a mole

04:34.357 --> 04:37.316
inside the most powerful
institution in the multiverse?

04:39.988 --> 04:41.229
Sure, why not?

04:41.323 --> 04:44.566
<i>Stop doing magic.
It's not for you.</i>

04:48.079 --> 04:50.162
Is this even
a Library matter?

04:50.248 --> 04:53.867
Hedges murdering each other
in the streets is a security concern.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.371
Can we use
the tracker Deweys?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.579
They stopped using those.
They're not idiots.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.129
Just psychopaths, then.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.670
So, we continue to
do nothing till what?

05:01.760 --> 05:04.503
They start putting blood worms
in card-carrying magicians?

05:05.013 --> 05:07.847
We need a
middle-ground solution.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.299
Temporary cure.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.429
Reed's Mark.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.058
I fail to see how hedges

05:15.148 --> 05:17.310
will interpret
such as empathetic.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
Agreed.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.273
They might feel we're
taking away their defenses.

05:21.363 --> 05:25.027
Well, get a blood worm
and cast, you boil alive.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.357
So, there's that.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.867
Reed's Mark
would prevent them

05:28.954 --> 05:31.617
from triggering the parasite,
even accidentally.

05:31.706 --> 05:35.290
I'm barely aware half the time
I cast little things.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.959
Still, they'd never
submit to it.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.290
It would be voluntary.

05:39.923 --> 05:44.759
<i>For those already infected,
and those living in fear.</i>

05:46.137 --> 05:50.051
<i>No paperwork,
no questions asked.</i>

05:50.141 --> 05:53.634
<i>Then once this Serpent group
have been dealt with,</i>

05:53.728 --> 05:56.095
the mark is removed
free of charge.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.188
Sound. I second.

06:02.654 --> 06:03.861
Those opposed?

06:06.241 --> 06:10.485
Motion passed.
Reed's Mark it is.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.852
Anyone can be turned
with the right leverage.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.149
It'll have to be
someone high up in the Library.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.856
Everyone's got
a weak spot.

06:55.707 --> 06:56.788
Mom, what's wrong?

07:01.630 --> 07:04.122
What do you mean, inside?

07:04.215 --> 07:05.581
Text me a picture.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.509
Guys?

07:15.894 --> 07:18.386
- What the fuck is going on?
- What is she saying?

07:19.689 --> 07:21.351
What?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.353
What do you mean,
you're in pieces?

07:28.531 --> 07:31.569
- Guys, I think we have our leverage.
- Okay.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.548
How is it possible?

07:48.051 --> 07:51.169
- Is it shards?
- No. It'll add up to the real her.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.512
The beacon summoned
the true Harriet.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.261
It's just she's been
in the Mirror World so long.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.726
It's a crazy place.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.996
Something must have
happened to her

07:59.020 --> 08:00.431
and shattered her
into three pieces.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.263
And you,
your mother, and I,

08:02.357 --> 08:03.751
we were the ones
that made the beacon,

08:03.775 --> 08:06.142
so, a part of her
came to each of us.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.146
So, what do you want?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.732
The nearest
pipe junction box.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.488
Why would I ever...
After Modesto...

08:14.577 --> 08:16.284
Because you
want your daughter.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.413
Look, we are trying to stop
what's happening out here.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.209
More magic will lower
the body count,

08:23.294 --> 08:27.334
or this situation you created
blows up into a full-on war.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.416
You put more out
there for anyone...

08:29.509 --> 08:31.341
Hedges have
always self-policed.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.672
I consider it my
full-time responsibility.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.097
You have my word.

08:39.394 --> 08:40.929
Your proposal is very risky.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.852
So is putting
Harriet back together.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.349
But I can do it.
Can you?

08:47.110 --> 08:48.337
I can fix her.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.568
If you give Kady the box.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.946
Fine, we have a deal.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.243
A moment?
It's urgent. Sorry.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.071
We'll give you a moment.
Alice, walk with me.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.165
A few details.

09:03.501 --> 09:04.742
An entire safe house?

09:04.836 --> 09:05.836
In 10 minutes,

09:05.920 --> 09:08.754
everybody was infected.
Half of them are dead.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.127
We have to find that guy
in that stupid mask.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.210
Now. Okay,
start some locators.

09:14.888 --> 09:19.053
Casting spells in the current
socio-political climate is...

09:19.142 --> 09:21.054
I much prefer
option 'B', which is,

09:21.144 --> 09:22.476
this guy gets Reed's Mark

09:22.562 --> 09:24.975
and waits until
this mushroom cloud dissipates.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.397
You can't be serious.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.644
I can't believe you're not.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.771
I got your back,

09:29.861 --> 09:33.480
but I would prefer to do that
in one solid non-crispy piece.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.816
Give me a day.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.550
That's hot,
that's hot, that's hot.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.874
So, we're looking
for what, exactly?

09:45.960 --> 09:46.960
Any reference

09:47.045 --> 09:49.753
to the annoyingly vague
message the dragon sent me.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.080
"Seek the Binder."

09:51.174 --> 09:52.174
I hate riddles.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.874
But if it could
jumper cable her, then...

09:53.968 --> 09:57.052
In "D&D", a Binder's, like,
a low class level of...

09:57.138 --> 09:58.299
- Announcement.
- Damn it.

09:58.389 --> 10:02.474
The stone from your dragon
person is 100% god piece.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.268
That is good news.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.267
No.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.357
The good news is

10:08.441 --> 10:11.525
I can feel how many
pieces are still missing.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.565
Any guesses?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.856
The answer is one.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.363
Only Enyalius stands between

10:19.452 --> 10:21.944
me and anatomical perfection.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.989
Find him and bring me
the final piece.

10:26.918 --> 10:27.918
Cheesy puffs?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.295
Um...

10:35.385 --> 10:39.846
I guess we switch tracks
to find Enyalius.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.797
It's not gonna be easy.
He knows we're looking.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.759
A lot of gods kind
of have signatures. Um...

10:44.853 --> 10:47.470
Ways to look for them,
whether they mean to or not.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.564
So, we research and,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.935
while we're there,
we solve this Binder shit.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.648
Are we taking
our snacky friend?

10:54.737 --> 10:56.148
Since I have no other way

10:56.239 --> 10:58.401
to motivate you
than this meat sack,

10:58.491 --> 11:00.278
know if you take too long,

11:00.368 --> 11:03.111
I'm going ice cave climbing

11:03.204 --> 11:04.411
with no clothes,

11:04.497 --> 11:07.331
until this body
freezes forever.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.297
<i>Stop changing
the subject. The Napster?</i>

11:15.383 --> 11:16.383
It's odd.

11:16.467 --> 11:20.177
Not only is the Great Snow
100 years early, when it sings,

11:20.263 --> 11:21.263
it's in soprano.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.347
Fascinating.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.764
Can you tell me
what the cat lady

11:23.850 --> 11:25.557
said about
my destiny lizard?

11:25.643 --> 11:29.808
Well, the message
was very unclear.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.015
You were mind melding
for 12 hours.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.976
Uh, she's very mercurial.
Josh, hello!

11:35.069 --> 11:36.276
Hi.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.362
Glad you're back.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.360
Talking points up the waz.
Here's number one.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.066
Eliot! Alive.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.944
- What?
- Yeah.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.451
Q sent a troop
of these cuties to exposit.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.873
Eliot's alive,
albeit in mind-prison,

11:49.959 --> 11:51.666
while The Monster
controls the joystick.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.621
Talking point <i>dos.</i>
Thank you.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.923
A wild Fillorian clock tree
has sprouted up,

11:58.009 --> 11:59.841
leaving a village
stuck in time.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.840
It's been a total
clockster fuck.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.718
No? Nothing?

12:05.808 --> 12:09.142
Okay, anyway,
with the ambient being so low,

12:09.229 --> 12:10.706
that's the latest on
the magical weirdness list,

12:10.730 --> 12:11.730
which is getting long.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.043
- We should call the Council.
- Step ahead of you, sister.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.649
In my official capacity

12:15.735 --> 12:17.772
as pinch-hitter
and fill-in crown-wearer,

12:17.862 --> 12:19.524
I planned a state dinner.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.697
Nothing brings
peeps closer together

12:21.783 --> 12:24.400
to solve a global
catastrophe like good eats.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.202
Margo, you're gonna wanna
see the guest list.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.075
Q is positive he's
alive in there?

12:29.165 --> 12:30.165
Yeah.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.494
Aww.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.584
Oh. Oh!

12:39.300 --> 12:41.417
I'll just

12:41.511 --> 12:43.093
go now.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.136
That was the most...

12:49.227 --> 12:52.061
Thorough sex
I've ever had.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.557
So, I'll see you
when I get back.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.641
Uh, uh. But the royals
are arriving.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.101
- And I have to go save Eliot.
- How?

12:59.195 --> 13:02.108
Or, is the idea to
be a friend by dying?

13:02.740 --> 13:05.027
Uh-huh. Don't make
a sorry dumb gesture.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.075
Will you just stay
for the feast?

13:07.161 --> 13:08.402
I invited the Foremost.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.862
Foremost what?

13:09.956 --> 13:11.663
He leads
a nomadic tribe that,

13:11.749 --> 13:13.365
according to my apricot guy

13:13.459 --> 13:15.325
who's tight with
their agave trader,

13:15.420 --> 13:16.536
was once ravaged

13:16.629 --> 13:18.461
by body-possessing
demonic spirits.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.548
And?

13:19.632 --> 13:23.592
And in act three of the movie,
the Foremost saved them

13:23.678 --> 13:25.795
with special weapons
that expel possession.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.470
You're shitting me.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.924
Nope, that's the one thing
we didn't just do.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.304
They call them ice axes,

13:31.394 --> 13:33.010
and I'm assuming
that's poetic license.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.228
So, we might have
a chance to save Eliot.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.024
Yeah.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.024
Keep it up, Josh.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.944
I'm gonna go get dressed
for the banquet.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.367
"Keep it up, Josh."

13:49.996 --> 13:50.996
Phew.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.001
Okay, fine. I'll bite.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.546
- What's the paper?
- Perhaps, you've heard.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.841
There's a wave of
hedge witch terrorism.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.635
- Is it a wave?
- Depends on who you ask.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.055
Certainly, The Librarian
who requested

14:10.141 --> 14:12.724
a list of rejected students
had an opinion.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.426
What? They asked
for a watch list?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.102
Of potential hedges, yes.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.398
Everyone has a line, Alice.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.568
Apparently, mine is
turning over a list

14:22.653 --> 14:23.814
to what's starting to feel

14:23.905 --> 14:26.898
like a goddamn
totalitarian regime.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.823
Who knew?

14:30.078 --> 14:31.194
I have to resign.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.325
Well, since you've grown
morals apparently,

14:34.415 --> 14:35.781
I have an alternative.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.959
Set myself on fire?
Tempting.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.501
Sack up and stay here,

14:43.591 --> 14:45.751
where you can do an ounce of
good and protect the list.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.886
I'm old. I'm tired.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.719
- I have no way to protect it.
- Had no way.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.222
Zelda is outside,
and she needs your lab

14:55.311 --> 14:57.143
and a whole lot of magic.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.940
And most importantly,
your secrecy.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.391
Why should that come cheap?

15:02.485 --> 15:05.398
Go talk to her,
while I research.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.740
Binders
of various types.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.661
The word "Binder" is
in a ton of actual titles? Huh?

15:14.747 --> 15:18.411
Google "The Binder,"
120 million hits.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.918
You think that dragon's
trolling me?

15:22.004 --> 15:23.461
Anything new on Enyalius?

15:23.965 --> 15:25.957
'Cause I got a
fresh take on that.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.092
Let's find him,
get his rock,

15:29.178 --> 15:32.012
destroy it before
the Monster comes back.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.385
Oh, I love it.

15:34.892 --> 15:35.928
Ah.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.761
Except for the part
where it doesn't save Eliot.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.690
We'll figure something out.
We always do.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.267
No, bro.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.755
Take it from someone
from a timeline

15:46.779 --> 15:49.146
where you did not
figure it out.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.482
We'll find Enyalius first.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.535
I'm not talking
about this now.

16:06.716 --> 16:10.551
<i>But no one
made it out of that expedition alive.</i>

16:11.387 --> 16:14.050
<i>Have you ever
wondered about your past lives?</i>

16:14.140 --> 16:16.883
<i>If you have long-lost loves
or suppressed memories...</i>

16:16.976 --> 16:17.976
Memories.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.222
<i>...search no further.</i>

16:21.731 --> 16:23.939
Thank God for
priority overnight.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.438
I'll send your mom
some chocolates.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.988
She'll like that,
if they're made of wine.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.532
Traveler's blood?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.537
Once it starts,

16:38.623 --> 16:39.955
I'll have to seal the lab

16:40.041 --> 16:41.498
and you'll both
have to wait outside.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.332
Bjorn's Electromagnetic
is unstable.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.334
Good thing
I'm a phosphoromancer.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.970
- Okay, we're about ready.
- One thing.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.925
The Harriet that came
to me was exaggerated.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.681
It seems
when she fragmented,

17:01.771 --> 17:03.262
so did her personality.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.520
Just be aware.

17:06.651 --> 17:07.651
Thanks.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.193
But I'm more concerned
with getting them out quickly

17:10.279 --> 17:14.114
to the same place, so we can
reunite them at all, so...

17:14.200 --> 17:15.862
Now out, both of you.

17:17.494 --> 17:21.865
Just don't fuck yourself up
too much, okay?

17:21.958 --> 17:23.869
You punched me in the face.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.954
Don't die.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.937
Shit, it overloaded!

18:35.197 --> 18:36.688
I have to fix the prism.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.635
What are you doing?
No, we don't have any time.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.366
We're running out of ambient.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.534
I don't understand you.
Look, I have to do this now.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.790
Oops. You fucked that one up.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.464
Interesting application.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.799
But I can improve on this.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.509
Okay, but we have
to fix this now!

19:07.605 --> 19:09.187
- No, we have time.
- No, we don't.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.639
Don't be
such a scaredy bitch.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.565
- I'm not.
- Ah.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.773
That's what you are.
You're the mouse inside me.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.529
I get you promised to fix her,

19:17.615 --> 19:19.968
but honestly, I don't see the point
in putting us back together.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.029
You're absolutely worthless.
You can go now.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.654
Give that back
to me right now!

19:24.705 --> 19:25.821
No. I wanna play with it.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.699
- Give it back. Give it back, you arrogant bitch!
- Mmm-mmm.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.580
Oh, my God, your stupid face.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.502
You're gonna destroy
everything again!

19:39.845 --> 19:41.507
She's dangerous. I had to.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.680
I need to. Just wait.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.348
Move!

19:48.187 --> 19:49.974
Move!

20:01.409 --> 20:03.071
That bitch.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.321
Hello? Hello!

20:08.082 --> 20:10.119
God damn it.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.702
Margo will want
those by the throne.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.458
And you go
to the wine cellar.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.588
- Oh, hi. You must be looking for the...
- Fen.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.136
My name is Ru.
Queen of West Loria.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.758
I'd like a private word.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.715
Leave us.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.637
What was your creature?

20:32.314 --> 20:33.458
There's no sense
in denying it.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.348
The thing told me
its sister visited you.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.226
My prophecy was concise.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.360
For the health of my land,

20:39.405 --> 20:41.192
I must aid you
in dethroning the High King,

20:41.282 --> 20:44.525
violently if necessary.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.365
I see yours lines right up.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.868
Look, Margo has
a reputation, but...

20:49.957 --> 20:52.745
Gods, don't tell me
you're friends.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.792
No, no.

20:54.879 --> 21:00.375
But I've thought about this
and realized my,

21:00.468 --> 21:05.680
our job here, is indeed to do
what's best for our lands,

21:05.765 --> 21:07.427
and that's just not
necessarily...

21:07.516 --> 21:09.974
You're about to speechify
on fighting one's destiny?

21:10.060 --> 21:12.097
No, no, no, no. Um...
On listening to one's guts.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.225
I'm willing to forge
a peace with Fillory

21:14.315 --> 21:16.523
once you take the throne.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.067
Then and only then.

21:20.154 --> 21:22.237
Wow. Okay.

21:22.323 --> 21:27.034
I'm just saying,
there are so many paths...

21:27.119 --> 21:29.327
During the feast,
you will order the castle doors open

21:29.413 --> 21:31.120
whereupon my men will enter

21:31.207 --> 21:33.247
- and chop off her head.
- Enjoy the dessert course.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.167
Did you really think
I was gonna say that?

21:36.253 --> 21:37.289
Hoped.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.506
A ruler never walks away
of their own accord.

21:41.592 --> 21:42.958
They must be crushed.

21:43.511 --> 21:46.675
Now, I don't relish this,

21:46.764 --> 21:49.507
but we are responsible
for our own kingdoms.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.808
There is but one alternative.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.018
Everlasting banishment.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.558
But that's a form of death.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.311
You have until dinner
to decide.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.020
Or I'll be forced
to see to it

22:00.110 --> 22:03.603
that your head joins hers
in the basket.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.361
Quentin. Hoolia.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.783
Whatever your name is.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.610
I have the most perfect idea.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.866
Um, who is that?

22:13.499 --> 22:16.458
Is this a game, or...

22:16.544 --> 22:19.457
Are you aware that
there's big money for psychics

22:19.547 --> 22:22.506
who are in actuality
big, giant fakers?

22:22.967 --> 22:26.426
I had to try 19
before I found a real one.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.305
Allan,

22:31.392 --> 22:33.304
you're going to
help me so much.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.135
Help you with what, exactly?

22:35.229 --> 22:38.017
Remembering my past life.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.730
Could you guys
make me a snack?

22:39.817 --> 22:41.103
We'd like some privacy.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.776
Is that gonna be okay?

22:51.412 --> 22:53.028
This guy's mind
better be strong as hell,

22:53.122 --> 22:56.160
'cause if it gets
too hot in there...

22:56.250 --> 22:57.250
Oh, boy.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.750
Attention, customers.
Clean up in the baby food aisle.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.630
You forgot the chips.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.387
There's no pulse.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.179
Relax. It's fine.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.309
I'll get another one.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.975
No, it won't work.
You're too strong.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.805
Fine, I'll get
a strong one.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.561
You're upset.

23:21.650 --> 23:25.269
I'll get this gross corpse
out of your sight.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.445
See you when I find
a new psychic friend.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.614
Wait. I can help.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.488
I know a psychic with
a real strong mind.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.578
Penny, don't.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.079
Who?

23:35.789 --> 23:36.950
Me.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.503
No.

23:42.922 --> 23:46.916
Just... You say no,
and then no?

23:47.009 --> 23:48.849
Cute, you wanna make this
about me being bossy,

23:48.886 --> 23:50.502
but we both just saw
that guy die.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.339
I'm not that guy.
I studied this.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.298
I had The Beast in my head.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.634
Don't get me wrong.
I'm glad that you care.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.970
Ha-ha. But I actually do.

24:00.064 --> 24:02.056
Ha-ha.
But I actually get that.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.731
And I'm being serious.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.522
So, how about this?

24:09.365 --> 24:13.860
If I don't die,
I can take you out for a drink.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.153
What, are you kidding?

24:17.247 --> 24:19.204
That's something that
regular people do.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.578
Yeah, fuck it.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.035
Okay, try this.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.209
Live,

24:25.714 --> 24:27.580
and you can buy me dinner.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.560
That was fun.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.309
It took a lot of rocks
to sink the body.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.350
Ready to get started, Percy?

25:04.878 --> 25:06.369
Okay.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.796
So, why are we here?

25:10.592 --> 25:12.754
It's important.

25:12.845 --> 25:16.429
Not sure why.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.427
That's okay.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.144
This field,

25:21.228 --> 25:24.562
was there a house,
or anything else here?

25:24.648 --> 25:26.435
No. Nothing.

25:27.943 --> 25:31.061
Wait. An altar.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.947
And some bowls.

25:36.827 --> 25:40.867
Good. Think about the bowls.
Anything inside them?

25:41.457 --> 25:43.790
Stones. The stones.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.743
The ones they put
part of me into.

25:47.296 --> 25:50.209
But not yet.
They're still empty.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.582
And rope.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.921
- Lots of rope.
- Nothing here can hurt you.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.550
- They said they were scared of me.
- Who?

26:02.770 --> 26:05.888
Bacchus. Iris. Heka.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.979
But they needed Enyalius.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.061
They couldn't do
it without him.

26:24.333 --> 26:28.077
I know what they did
for Enyalius to make him come.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.295
There is a girl

26:31.924 --> 26:33.790
near death.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.505
She was their sacrifice.

26:37.096 --> 26:41.306
Stop him.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.345
- Stop him.
- I can't.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.802
Everything that is happening
has already happened.

26:45.896 --> 26:49.060
He called me monster,
but look at him.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.481
He loved it.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.480
The scent of a dying girl.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.862
Some god of war.

26:56.949 --> 27:00.283
He only liked them
when they were too weak to fight.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.992
You're not strong,
Enyalius.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.745
You're a sad,

27:07.835 --> 27:10.418
perverse little...

27:10.504 --> 27:12.746
Why is this
making me so upset?

27:13.423 --> 27:14.709
Maybe there's more here.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.426
Keep watching.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.760
He's bleeding. Should we...

27:27.855 --> 27:31.348
No. He said to wait
as long as possible.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.187
One more minute.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.272
Hi. Thank God
you saw the door.

27:36.363 --> 27:39.447
No. It's me, it's me.
It's the real me. It's Eliot, okay?

27:39.533 --> 27:41.928
This is a mind palace situation
and we don't have a lot of time,

27:41.952 --> 27:43.872
and I have some extremely
major shit to tell you.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.698
Maybe there's more.

27:47.791 --> 27:51.205
Maybe there's more.
What is it? What is it?

27:51.295 --> 27:52.331
Traveler.

27:52.421 --> 27:53.662
But it is only
a matter of time

27:53.755 --> 27:55.246
before he remembers it,
too, okay?

27:55.340 --> 27:57.582
- So, you have to...
- Percy 23?

27:57.676 --> 27:59.258
- Shit.
- Go, go, go, go.

27:59.344 --> 28:03.258
Percy 23. Percy 23.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.010
- Percy 23.
- Right here.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.762
Where were you?

28:06.852 --> 28:08.764
- I was just exploring.
- What did you see?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.971
Nothing. There's nothing
else here.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.023
If you are lying to me,
I will have you flayed.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.071
Shit.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.156
Penny!

28:23.410 --> 28:24.570
That was helpful.

28:28.916 --> 28:32.876
Tell him I said thanks.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.500
I know just who to find
exactly to Enyalius' tastes.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.418
We're going to find him,

28:38.508 --> 28:41.171
and I'm going
to be whole again.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.590
This is a great day.

28:44.848 --> 28:45.848
Penny.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.049
<i>Would you care for a pipe?</i>

29:04.201 --> 29:07.160
We're a lot alike,
you and I.

29:08.622 --> 29:11.865
My mother was
a hedge witch, too. She died.

29:12.542 --> 29:13.623
I was 10.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.036
- I didn't know you were a hedge.
- Oh, yes.

29:17.381 --> 29:20.545
My mentor, Everett,
found me,

29:20.634 --> 29:23.251
sounds dramatic,
in an alley.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.337
Gave me shelter, education,

29:27.266 --> 29:28.928
believed in me.

29:30.727 --> 29:34.721
I will never need
to do those things again, but...

29:36.108 --> 29:39.317
My choices now seem

29:39.403 --> 29:40.894
worse.

29:43.532 --> 29:44.676
That's why
I agreed to give you

29:44.700 --> 29:46.407
the location of
the pipe junction.

29:46.493 --> 29:49.361
'Cause someone
gets hurt regardless.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.915
Because I know

29:54.001 --> 29:56.539
you'll work to
keep things fair.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.460
Safe.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.334
And you know this how?

30:02.592 --> 30:04.629
Because we both
had shitty moms?

30:04.720 --> 30:08.464
Because you have the capacity

30:08.557 --> 30:11.641
to sit with the woman who caused
the death of the man you love.

30:13.103 --> 30:15.811
To try and understand her.

30:17.858 --> 30:20.350
So, I have faith

30:20.444 --> 30:22.936
you'll make choices
that hurt the fewest people.

30:27.701 --> 30:30.694
Okay, look, you can fix
a prism with Strand's Vitrum.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.028
Right, but do we need

30:32.122 --> 30:34.535
to adjust the refraction angle
for a break, or...

30:34.624 --> 30:36.206
I don't understand
sign language!

30:36.960 --> 30:38.121
Okay.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.669
You have to adjust,
of course.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.088
We need to cut a new prism.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.083
I don't know
what you're saying!

30:47.846 --> 30:50.088
No! You don't know!

30:51.016 --> 30:54.430
She destroyed my life with her crazy ideas
and her insane confidence.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.805
God damn it.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.004
Hi again, bitch.

31:23.173 --> 31:24.960
What do I do? What do I do?

31:25.050 --> 31:27.884
- I do Strand's Vitrum.
- Cut a new prism.

31:28.011 --> 31:30.114
- Combine Gentileschi...
- Doesn't matter, though, because you're...

31:30.138 --> 31:31.674
- I'm not.
- You're frozen.

31:31.765 --> 31:34.098
You move one hand to fix it,
and you freeze.

31:34.184 --> 31:35.384
You need to let me
out of here.

31:35.435 --> 31:38.428
- But what you wanna do...
- What you actually deserve.

31:39.356 --> 31:42.349
Maybe I do. Maybe I'm just
too much to live.

31:42.442 --> 31:43.774
But the fact
of the matter is,

31:43.860 --> 31:45.463
if you throw one tiny piece
of magic in here,

31:45.487 --> 31:47.399
it bounces,
and we both vaporize.

31:47.489 --> 31:50.948
Yeah, well, don't be so sure.
I hate that idea.

31:51.243 --> 31:55.408
You can't. See?
You need me.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.573
You, you're an egomaniac.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.367
- You only care about yourself.
- Someone had to.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.081
No one else gave a shit.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.371
Because you alienated
them all.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.836
Our IQ did that.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.461
Your arrogance. Oh.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.422
"I'm so smart. Look at me."

32:10.512 --> 32:13.550
"Love me, love me.
I won't exist unless you love me."

32:13.640 --> 32:16.553
"I'm so sorry I'm smart.
It's not you, it's me.

32:16.643 --> 32:17.929
"I'm so sorry."

32:18.019 --> 32:19.019
Right.

32:19.521 --> 32:21.387
That's exactly why
you destroyed the keys,

32:21.481 --> 32:23.598
because you're such a
goddamn genius.

32:24.985 --> 32:27.068
I didn't do that. You did.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.111
- That's bullshit!
- No.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.359
My arrogance didn't destroy
the stupid keys.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.029
Fear did. You did.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.371
You ruined my life.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.415
We did that together.

32:44.671 --> 32:48.540
You're right.
I can't fix the prism.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.841
Because it's a big swing
and it might blow up,

32:50.927 --> 32:52.168
and that's my thing?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.922
Do you wanna know what
the biggest swing there is?

32:56.016 --> 32:57.177
Us agreeing.

32:57.684 --> 33:00.427
Self destruction would be
a sad waste of both of us.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.979
'Cause we still have no idea
what we're actually capable of.

33:05.442 --> 33:06.774
That scares me, too.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.819
Does it scare you so much
you'd just rather never know?

33:10.280 --> 33:12.272
Just leave me in here to die?

33:12.365 --> 33:16.735
And you go live
your ordinary waste of a life?

33:33.094 --> 33:34.551
Well, that's not weird at all.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.845
Does that say "Binder"?

33:40.936 --> 33:43.053
- Isn't Julia looking for...
- But we shouldn't.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.513
Clearly, it wants us to.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.564
Let's not get
precious about it.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.746
All right, let's fix
this fucker.

34:28.024 --> 34:31.141
Okay, are you ready
to pull yourself together?

34:41.371 --> 34:42.371
Red alert.

34:42.455 --> 34:45.539
So, there is a
palace coup underway.

34:46.208 --> 34:48.371
Fen is planning
to defenestrate you.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.793
It's a destiny thing.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.793
That balsa-toed bitch.

34:54.884 --> 34:57.342
I'd like to see her try.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.466
Quick. Where's the Foremost?

34:59.556 --> 35:01.343
Not here yet, I guess.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.470
Hold off the traitor
till I talk to him.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.640
- Then let her come.
- Okay. Great.

35:14.696 --> 35:16.312
Stand here, so,
Fen can't see me.

35:16.406 --> 35:17.692
She's trying to overthrow me.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.774
It's a long story
and I'm handling it.

35:19.868 --> 35:22.736
Where is the Foremost?

35:22.829 --> 35:24.991
Leader of the Southern Nomads?

35:25.081 --> 35:27.038
Wandering in the south,
I imagine.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.084
He and his axes are supposed
to be here, Tick.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.537
But he'd never come to this.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.087
Oceans of apology, Majesty,

35:38.178 --> 35:40.886
but the Foremost
is a sworn enemy of Fillory

35:40.972 --> 35:43.430
and will not interact
with her citizens.

35:43.516 --> 35:44.597
Much less High King.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.175
You're joking.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.635
But this whole...

35:49.272 --> 35:52.640
I need him, Tick.
For Eliot.

35:54.235 --> 35:57.148
Oh, I see.
How can I assist?

35:57.238 --> 35:59.275
Would you like me
to travel to the South

35:59.366 --> 36:03.360
and use false Lorian papers
to seek an audience?

36:03.453 --> 36:06.742
The Pickwicks are
a notoriously thirsty people,

36:06.831 --> 36:08.572
making them ill-suited
for the desert,

36:08.667 --> 36:12.160
and I have a violent
allergy to the sand.

36:12.253 --> 36:13.994
And of course,
I'm not a magician.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.547
But if it helps,
it would be an honor...

36:16.633 --> 36:20.092
I get it. It's a job
for a tough bitch.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.340
So, it has to be me.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.843
Oh, thank you.
I would have died.

36:24.933 --> 36:25.969
Oh, please.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.808
You by any chance seen Margo?

36:28.895 --> 36:32.138
Oh, my semi-girlfriend who saved
my life and is also a great King?

36:32.232 --> 36:34.770
No. Why?

36:34.859 --> 36:36.600
No reason. Just, uh...

36:38.321 --> 36:39.402
Oh.

36:39.489 --> 36:42.948
Actually, uh,
I have to go sneeze.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.784
- Can we talk?
- Do it.

36:47.497 --> 36:48.578
- Excuse me?
- Fen.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.199
Do it.

36:52.585 --> 36:53.746
I don't understand.

36:53.837 --> 36:56.830
Overthrow me right
the fuck now, Fen.

36:56.923 --> 36:59.666
- I never should have...
- Or I will never forgive you.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.584
And neither will Eliot,

37:01.678 --> 37:05.046
if you keep me from getting
the one thing that can save him.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.554
Um...

37:11.813 --> 37:14.430
Excuse me.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.390
I need a word with the guard.

37:34.711 --> 37:37.124
<i>By order of High King Fen,</i>

37:37.547 --> 37:41.791
<i>Margo of tribe Hansen
is forever banished,</i>

37:41.885 --> 37:45.378
never again to step upon
the soil of Fillory,

37:45.472 --> 37:47.759
never again
to breathe its air,

37:47.849 --> 37:49.215
or feel its magic.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.845
Oh, get on with it.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.978
Son of a pig fucker.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.568
Perfect words to
remember you by.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.445
Wait!
I curse Fen's name.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.617
But if I were you,
I'd listen to her!

38:08.703 --> 38:11.741
And wait!
Be nice to her!

38:12.081 --> 38:15.916
Your grandkids'
grandkids will fear me!

38:23.802 --> 38:25.088
Margo, wait!

38:26.846 --> 38:28.963
Five seconds. Please.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.636
Look, I should go with you.

38:34.729 --> 38:38.018
Josh, I can handle my shit.

38:38.107 --> 38:43.193
What I can't handle is Fillory blowing up,
so, please just help Fen. Okay?

38:44.405 --> 38:45.521
Okay.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.071
For your journey.

38:48.117 --> 38:52.282
Just a few simple fig apricot saffron
cardamom vanilla plum danishes.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.372
They'll keep.

38:53.456 --> 38:56.665
So, and a new map.
Very helpful.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.368
Also, fully charged.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.124
When the going gets tough,

39:01.214 --> 39:02.955
tough listens
to pop anthems from the '80s.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.568
- Josh...
- Just a thought. Never mind.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.174
You're a good man.

39:06.261 --> 39:07.342
Oh.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.017
Okay, I'm gonna try
and live through this

39:15.103 --> 39:17.516
'cause it's feeling like
we got some more banging to do.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.267
It does, right?

39:20.191 --> 39:23.355
But don't wait for me, Hoberman.
Let's be realistic.

39:23.444 --> 39:24.855
Totally. Totally.

39:24.946 --> 39:27.734
I'm probably going to wait for you, though.
So, sorry.

39:27.824 --> 39:31.488
Don't be a fool, Josh.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.992
<i>Now, there's
no looking forward</i>

39:39.085 --> 39:41.498
<i>Now, there's no turning back</i>

39:41.588 --> 39:44.251
<i>When you say
We belong to the light</i>

39:44.340 --> 39:46.957
<i>We belong to the thunder</i>

39:48.803 --> 39:51.546
<i>We belong to the sound of
the words</i>

39:51.639 --> 39:55.724
<i>We've both fallen under</i>

39:55.810 --> 40:01.556
<i>Whatever we deny or embrace
for worse or for better</i>

40:01.649 --> 40:08.488
<i>We belong we belong
we belong together</i>

40:17.832 --> 40:19.915
It's been far too long.

40:20.001 --> 40:21.537
I think we should go in.

40:36.017 --> 40:37.633
Alice, you okay?

40:37.727 --> 40:39.844
All in one piece,
but a little shaky.

40:40.730 --> 40:43.188
Let's get you
several snacks, huh?

40:45.401 --> 40:46.401
Thank you.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.687
Consider the list
misplaced indefinitely.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.472
<i>There's nothing we can
do while he just goes out there</i>

43:01.496 --> 43:02.696
<i>and looks for someone to kill.</i>

43:03.873 --> 43:07.867
- We have to do something.
- Yeah, I know. But what?

43:09.879 --> 43:11.871
Whoa, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.500
- Dude, sit down.
- No.

43:14.801 --> 43:16.963
- You just had a seizure.
- Where's the Monster?

43:17.053 --> 43:19.545
He's looking for a girl
for Enyalius.

43:19.639 --> 43:21.426
Okay. I saw Eliot in there.

43:21.516 --> 43:23.678
- Is he...
- Alive. And poking around like a pro.

43:23.768 --> 43:27.853
The Monster, everything he can't remember,
it's in there. All of it.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.271
Wait, Eliot saw this?

43:29.357 --> 43:33.101
He saw something in the
Monster's memories, buried.

43:33.194 --> 43:35.277
We've been wrong
about everything.

43:35.363 --> 43:36.899
He's not trying
to rebuild his body.

43:36.989 --> 43:38.175
That's not what
the stones are.

43:38.199 --> 43:40.691
That's not what they're for.

43:40.785 --> 43:42.492
It's so much worse than that.
