WEBVTT

00:01.681 --> 00:03.415
You wrote about me and Tank?

00:03.441 --> 00:06.596
You had no right without
asking my permission.

00:09.264 --> 00:11.880
- I would never try to replace your mom.
- She's still alive.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.464
Regina: Her name is Hope Paxton.

00:13.584 --> 00:15.282
I booked a ticket to Atlanta.

00:15.401 --> 00:16.433
I'm coming with you.

00:16.469 --> 00:17.398
Daphne: Is that your son?

00:17.436 --> 00:19.269
He's with my son-of-a-bitch ex-husband...

00:19.305 --> 00:20.319
Wherever he is.

00:20.358 --> 00:24.256
I kissed someone in Mexico,
but it didn't mean anything.

00:24.273 --> 00:25.805
Was it with that audiologist guy?

00:25.805 --> 00:26.889
- Quinn?
- Yeah.

00:26.921 --> 00:28.245
- I'm pregnant.
- Well, is it mine?

00:28.280 --> 00:30.189
- Yes.
- You said you were into somebody else.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.336
I was faithful to you.

00:31.390 --> 00:33.566
You don't think every
single person in this country

00:33.587 --> 00:35.544
doesn't write off an
extra thing here or there?

00:35.664 --> 00:38.028
Do you really want our
kids to hear you say that?

00:38.057 --> 00:40.433
That cheating is okay
'cause everyone else does it?

00:40.458 --> 00:41.991
I didn't think of it as cheating.

00:43.175 --> 00:45.917
Wait. Okay. Is the IRS
coming after you guys?

00:45.930 --> 00:47.229
Could you guys go to jail?

00:47.246 --> 00:49.582
No one's going to jail, okay?

00:49.610 --> 00:51.837
But you have to sell the car washes.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.234
Yes. That'll take some of the pressure off.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.966
Is there anything I can do?

00:56.086 --> 00:57.541
No, you're already paying rent,

00:57.576 --> 01:00.366
which we don't like, but
we appreciate. We just...

01:00.869 --> 01:02.419
we wanted you guys to know.

01:03.349 --> 01:04.717
I've been thinking about

01:04.908 --> 01:06.466
maybe taking a semester off?

01:06.482 --> 01:07.933
No. Absolutely not.

01:07.953 --> 01:10.545
Honey, your education is our priority.

01:10.574 --> 01:12.037
We will continue to support you.

01:12.069 --> 01:13.207
And I can help.

01:13.242 --> 01:15.083
John: And we appreciate that, but truly,

01:15.203 --> 01:16.814
things are stabilizing.

01:16.860 --> 01:20.570
We're not gonna allow our
situation to impact anybody.

01:20.574 --> 01:23.154
We just... we didn't
want it to be a secret.

01:23.224 --> 01:25.885
- So there's nothing we can do to help?
- No.

01:26.005 --> 01:29.996
Listen, everything is gonna
work out just fine, okay?

01:30.469 --> 01:31.881
You can count on that.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.251
I can't believe our parents are broke.

01:36.289 --> 01:39.637
- Hey, they're not broke.
- They're just not part of the 1% anymore.

01:39.757 --> 01:41.237
I feel kind of guilty.

01:41.453 --> 01:43.302
I'm the one they bailed out last year.

01:43.344 --> 01:45.496
Yeah, but you've only been
around for a few years.

01:45.524 --> 01:46.958
Think about me and Toby.

01:47.078 --> 01:49.571
If they didn't have to
pay for art supplies,

01:49.595 --> 01:52.011
and Buckner, and music equipment...

01:52.081 --> 01:53.884
Yeah, they could own
their own island by now.

01:54.175 --> 01:55.737
They're still paying my tuition,

01:55.766 --> 01:58.201
so I better go make it worth their pain.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.385
I'll see you guys later.

02:01.716 --> 02:02.438
Toby: Oh.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.726
Is that your hammer girl?

02:03.992 --> 02:05.634
Hi! Sorry. Excuse me,

02:05.754 --> 02:07.467
could I just see your shirt?

02:09.814 --> 02:10.664
Toby: Oh, man.

02:10.914 --> 02:13.145
You know what that says, right?

02:13.448 --> 02:16.535
Like, you didn't accidentally
fall into that shirt.

02:16.569 --> 02:17.640
What do you mean?

02:17.981 --> 02:19.514
Can I ask you where you bought that?

02:19.593 --> 02:21.758
Yeah. It's this site
called Tramp Stamp Teaze.

02:21.794 --> 02:23.465
That's "Teaze" like a slutty girl.

02:23.515 --> 02:25.544
Also "T's," like T-shirt. Get it?

02:25.596 --> 02:27.267
- Got it.
- Yeah. It's clever.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.277
It's really, really clever.

02:28.327 --> 02:30.059
- Cool. Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

02:31.371 --> 02:33.382
- Wow.
- Did you see that?

02:33.639 --> 02:34.549
(Scoffs)

02:35.060 --> 02:36.288
Yeah. I saw it.

02:36.315 --> 02:39.459
My empowered, take-no-prisoners
hammer girl just became

02:39.495 --> 02:43.480
a stupid, slutty... (Groans)

02:43.515 --> 02:45.101
Hammered girl.

02:47.711 --> 02:48.965
(Groans)

02:50.360 --> 02:55.351
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:57.652 --> 02:59.576
So what is it? What's the big news?

02:59.643 --> 03:02.331
I talked with our people
on the ground in San Marcos.

03:02.568 --> 03:05.837
Ramón's sign language
class is up to 12 students.

03:05.896 --> 03:07.150
No way!

03:07.200 --> 03:08.479
Guess who one of them is?

03:08.882 --> 03:11.462
A certain 15-year-old named Pati.

03:11.773 --> 03:13.020
Seriously?

03:13.398 --> 03:14.989
I told you she was gonna show.

03:14.993 --> 03:16.380
You totally did!

03:16.432 --> 03:19.383
I'm so happy right now. You have no idea.

03:19.451 --> 03:21.658
They said if more people
could get themselves there,

03:21.704 --> 03:23.889
then the class would
probably double in size.

03:24.009 --> 03:25.530
Pati had the same issue.

03:27.321 --> 03:29.278
The bus we took from her house cost what?

03:29.302 --> 03:31.380
Two pesos? What's that in dollars?

03:31.384 --> 03:33.084
Around 13 cents.

03:33.163 --> 03:37.446
That means a yearly bus
pass costs about $50.

03:37.469 --> 03:39.548
So, for $600,

03:39.565 --> 03:41.204
12 more people could learn how to sign?

03:41.443 --> 03:43.140
Uh-oh. I know that look.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.589
I could totally raise $600.

03:46.873 --> 03:48.178
If anyone could...

03:51.181 --> 03:53.928
Uh, I gotta go, but I'll see what I can do.

03:54.140 --> 03:55.302
Enjoy Guatemala.

03:55.337 --> 03:56.433
Talk to you later.

03:56.591 --> 03:57.471
Bye.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.299
Come in.

04:00.135 --> 04:01.258
What's up?

04:01.480 --> 04:03.458
Hi! Hey.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.251
You know that girl Pati I told you about?

04:07.516 --> 04:09.311
She showed up in sign language class.

04:09.318 --> 04:10.484
That's awesome.

04:10.519 --> 04:12.910
They have about 12 students right now,

04:12.976 --> 04:14.548
but they could double that.

04:14.627 --> 04:15.599
If...

04:15.719 --> 04:18.735
How do you feel about raising $600

04:18.765 --> 04:20.159
to buy bus passes

04:20.173 --> 04:22.279
for a bunch of deaf kids in Mexico?

04:22.341 --> 04:25.769
Uh, I feel great about that?

04:25.889 --> 04:28.237
- (Laughs)
- Perfect answer.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.290
Eric: Anyway, I think
this is close to all of it.

04:33.846 --> 04:35.459
I guess I live here now.

04:35.719 --> 04:37.157
How does it feel?

04:38.702 --> 04:39.724
Like home.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.240
Aww.

04:41.785 --> 04:43.961
I'm glad Daphne is cool with us being here.

04:44.081 --> 04:46.436
I imagine it's kind of a big deal for her.

04:52.031 --> 04:54.004
- She's upset.
- No.

04:54.183 --> 04:54.889
But?

04:55.454 --> 04:57.402
There's something I need to tell you.

04:58.042 --> 05:00.032
Remember that dinner she made for us

05:00.115 --> 05:01.815
and I got so upset?

05:01.844 --> 05:02.808
Yeah.

05:02.821 --> 05:05.106
She started questioning me a lot...

05:06.008 --> 05:07.724
And she knew I was lying,

05:07.782 --> 05:09.515
- so...
- No, you didn't.

05:09.635 --> 05:10.874
I had to.

05:11.326 --> 05:13.178
Did you tell Bay? And John and Kathryn?

05:13.226 --> 05:15.589
- No, no, no, no. Just Daphne.
- (Sighs)

05:16.524 --> 05:19.698
Look, she knows me so
well, and I was wrestling

05:19.748 --> 05:21.178
with whether or not to move in with you

05:21.215 --> 05:23.390
and I felt like I had to tell someone.

05:26.870 --> 05:28.199
Are you really mad?

05:30.098 --> 05:31.299
I guess it's done.

05:31.818 --> 05:35.352
And you have nothing to
worry about. I promise.

05:38.106 --> 05:39.105
Okay.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:50.907 --> 05:54.823
All I need is for 60
people to give me $10 each.

05:56.458 --> 05:57.835
- Me, too.
- Thanks.

05:57.955 --> 06:00.192
If we have any extra, I'm gonna use it

06:00.235 --> 06:03.222
to buy sign language
dictionaries and flashcards.

06:07.906 --> 06:10.971
I really want to do this on my own.

06:12.747 --> 06:16.512
Oh, my god. It's even more
disgusting than I imagined.

06:19.042 --> 06:21.472
"Don't worry, I'm on the pill,"

06:22.106 --> 06:24.701
"number one walk of shame champion,"

06:24.736 --> 06:26.553
"my kitty's Brazilian."

06:26.673 --> 06:27.804
Yikes.

06:28.955 --> 06:33.484
Ho ho, get a girl drunk enough
and you can push her into sex.

06:33.484 --> 06:36.257
Yeah, that's a great message
to be sending the world.

06:36.621 --> 06:39.207
Who's making these things anyway?

06:39.716 --> 06:42.001
Let's see.

06:43.455 --> 06:44.818
Bay: Hmm.

06:45.722 --> 06:48.059
I think I've seen that guy around campus.

06:48.288 --> 06:50.937
- Wait, he's a student?
- I'm pretty sure.

06:51.923 --> 06:53.518
I will go pay him a visit.

06:54.171 --> 06:55.265
I got this.

06:59.807 --> 07:02.715
Oh. Wow, that was a good kick.

07:04.548 --> 07:05.878
Yeah. Yeah.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.347
(Lily and Julian laugh)

07:09.389 --> 07:12.075
- (Laughs)
- It's the strangest feeling.

07:12.822 --> 07:14.173
Hey, babe.

07:14.599 --> 07:16.307
Oh! Hey.

07:17.663 --> 07:19.257
You must be Julian.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.137
I'm Toby.

07:23.215 --> 07:25.406
Oh, thank you.

07:32.543 --> 07:34.101
Absolutely.

07:44.550 --> 07:45.662
Oh, thank you.

07:45.698 --> 07:46.986
Sure.

07:47.973 --> 07:49.442
So...

07:49.692 --> 07:51.271
does he stop by often?

07:52.133 --> 07:53.192
No.

07:55.961 --> 07:57.676
Toby, he works in the deaf program.

07:57.703 --> 07:58.883
We're gonna cross paths.

08:00.698 --> 08:01.582
Right.

08:01.867 --> 08:03.434
(Phone vibrates)

08:03.554 --> 08:05.318
(Vibrating continues)

08:06.013 --> 08:06.990
It's your mom.

08:07.166 --> 08:08.538
(Sighs)

08:08.573 --> 08:10.190
That's like, her fifth phone call today.

08:12.447 --> 08:13.440
Everything okay?

08:14.165 --> 08:14.757
Yeah...

08:14.877 --> 08:15.947
Actually, there...

08:15.957 --> 08:18.147
there is something I've been
meaning to discuss with you.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.657
Okay.

08:23.455 --> 08:25.541
My parents want me to think about...

08:27.292 --> 08:28.405
moving home.

08:30.798 --> 08:31.493
To London.

08:33.589 --> 08:34.802
Why would we do that?

08:35.245 --> 08:36.669
So they could help us.

08:36.979 --> 08:39.153
But my family is here,

08:39.565 --> 08:41.847
my job is here, your job is here.

08:42.828 --> 08:46.355
But my parents have experience
raising a special needs child.

08:46.588 --> 08:48.236
I was thinking just in the beginning,

08:48.269 --> 08:49.879
maybe the first few years.

08:50.037 --> 08:52.307
- Years?
- My parents have a whole community out there.

08:52.367 --> 08:54.790
They know the best doctors,
the best therapists.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.303
They've done this before.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.859
Not just literally, but emotionally,

08:59.048 --> 09:00.131
they're prepared.

09:01.376 --> 09:03.315
We are having this child.

09:03.355 --> 09:04.323
They are not.

09:04.646 --> 09:06.992
All I ask is that you keep an open mind.

09:07.022 --> 09:08.810
It's something we should talk about.

09:10.501 --> 09:12.805
We could build a really
great life in London.

09:18.505 --> 09:20.337
John: So is her mind already made up?

09:20.679 --> 09:21.341
No,

09:21.653 --> 09:24.302
but I feel like she's
leaning in that direction.

09:24.422 --> 09:26.197
Do you want to move to London?

09:26.453 --> 09:27.211
No.

09:27.394 --> 09:29.242
I don't know anyone there and

09:29.458 --> 09:30.980
I don't even know if I can get a work visa.

09:31.262 --> 09:32.172
John: Okay then.

09:32.409 --> 09:33.752
We gotta convince her to stay.

09:33.909 --> 09:35.689
You know we'll do whatever we can.

09:36.082 --> 09:38.198
I think she needs to see
that there's more people here

09:38.212 --> 09:40.780
that she can count on besides just me.

09:40.816 --> 09:42.861
Well, then invite her
over for dinner tonight.

09:42.884 --> 09:43.974
We'll rally around her.

09:44.047 --> 09:44.951
John: Absolutely.

09:45.071 --> 09:47.513
We missed out on so many years with Daphne.

09:47.533 --> 09:49.670
We cannot let that happen
with our grandchild.

09:50.985 --> 09:51.825
Thanks.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.114
If I could have a moment of your time...

09:58.311 --> 09:59.418
Sir, just a few dollars,

09:59.438 --> 10:01.583
you could give someone
the gift of language!

10:02.336 --> 10:03.579
Hi, guys! Di...

10:05.357 --> 10:06.238
(Sighs)

10:06.673 --> 10:08.146
Uh-huh. Yeah.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.801
All right. Thank you so much,
man. I really appreciate it.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.060
Yeah. I'll see you soon.

10:12.467 --> 10:13.313
(Exhales)

10:13.348 --> 10:16.098
- Who was that?
- (Laughs) We are having a...

10:16.122 --> 10:18.635
Okay, I don't know how to say "fundraiser,"

10:18.655 --> 10:20.802
but... fundraiser at Scratch tonight!

10:20.962 --> 10:22.021
What do you mean?

10:22.057 --> 10:23.717
My buddy is a bartender there.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.342
He says he'll let us pass around a hat,

10:25.369 --> 10:27.629
put up signs, whatever we want.

10:27.918 --> 10:28.945
That's amazing!

10:28.980 --> 10:31.249
Yeah! I'll send an e-mail
blast, invite everyone I know.

10:31.262 --> 10:33.998
And I'll post this at the dorm
and the disabilities office.

10:34.002 --> 10:35.768
Hey, do you think I should...

10:35.804 --> 10:37.871
give like, a little presentation?

10:37.991 --> 10:39.216
Absolutely.

10:39.276 --> 10:40.907
Those people see what you saw,

10:41.027 --> 10:42.675
they're gonna bury you in cash.

10:44.729 --> 10:46.360
- You are the best.
- Hold on.

10:46.615 --> 10:49.218
You don't even know the best part yet.

10:49.258 --> 10:52.489
It's... I don't know how
to say this either, um...

10:53.320 --> 10:55.235
(Imitates a gun)

10:55.623 --> 10:56.879
- Cowboys?
- Yeah!

10:56.959 --> 10:58.458
Country Western night.

10:58.528 --> 11:00.960
You know. Line dancing,
boots, hats, the whole thing.

11:01.416 --> 11:02.536
Seriously?

11:02.552 --> 11:03.748
Hey, who cares, right?

11:03.825 --> 11:04.931
I guess.

11:05.051 --> 11:06.432
Yee-haw!

11:07.899 --> 11:09.531
Like cowboys say.

11:12.878 --> 11:13.705
Heyo!

11:14.158 --> 11:16.192
Oh, there they are!

11:16.232 --> 11:19.194
Oh, look at that belly!

11:19.550 --> 11:21.836
- Doesn't she look amazing?
- Hi.

11:21.956 --> 11:24.030
Oh, it's so good to see you.

11:24.052 --> 11:25.622
It's been too long.

11:25.648 --> 11:26.865
It's good to see you, too.

11:26.951 --> 11:28.516
Oh, hello in there.

11:28.533 --> 11:29.939
This is your grandpa.

11:30.125 --> 11:33.226
I cannot wait to take you
to your first Royals game.

11:33.875 --> 11:37.325
And you and I are going to bake
and draw and have sleepovers,

11:37.335 --> 11:39.252
and I am going to spoil you rotten!

11:39.295 --> 11:40.159
John: Yeah.

11:40.176 --> 11:41.927
Okay, everybody inside. Come on!

11:41.950 --> 11:43.463
Oh, yeah. Come on!

11:45.002 --> 11:47.904
You know, there are some
terrific places for kids

11:47.913 --> 11:50.157
with special needs right
here in Kansas City?

11:50.336 --> 11:52.327
Kathryn has done all this great research.

11:52.414 --> 11:53.996
Oh. That's really nice of you.

11:54.607 --> 11:57.469
Yeah. We are happy to do
whatever you need us to do.

11:57.482 --> 11:59.539
We want to be a big
part of your baby's life.

12:00.892 --> 12:01.769
You told them.

12:02.424 --> 12:03.677
It's their grandchild.

12:05.193 --> 12:08.206
- I just feel ambushed.
- No, no, no, no.

12:08.208 --> 12:10.096
We just want to talk it through.

12:10.098 --> 12:11.881
We know how much you love your job here,

12:11.912 --> 12:13.522
and you're so good at it...

12:14.067 --> 12:16.207
But London is where my family lives

12:16.218 --> 12:18.861
and they have experience
raising a special needs child.

12:18.913 --> 12:20.347
John: And we respect that.

12:20.467 --> 12:22.345
But you know, Kathryn and
I learned sign language

12:22.382 --> 12:24.205
when Daphne came into our lives.

12:24.381 --> 12:26.651
We are more than willing
to do whatever it takes

12:26.671 --> 12:28.863
to help raise a child with Down syndrome.

12:33.004 --> 12:37.184
You know, I pulled some of
Bay and Toby's old baby things.

12:37.230 --> 12:39.370
- Do you want to go look at them?
- Sure. Thanks.

12:45.633 --> 12:47.533
Oh, look!

12:47.569 --> 12:48.635
That's adorable.

12:49.814 --> 12:52.484
I used to put Toby to bed after a long day

12:52.540 --> 12:56.041
and still be sad that I didn't
get to see him till the morning.

12:56.394 --> 12:57.819
I can't wait.

13:01.610 --> 13:03.467
It goes by so fast.

13:05.070 --> 13:06.035
You'll see.

13:06.071 --> 13:08.036
(Sighs) I already feel like that.

13:08.156 --> 13:11.257
I'm more than halfway and there's
just so many decisions to make.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.961
Is there anything I can do to help?

13:16.425 --> 13:18.064
My mom wants me to go home,

13:18.099 --> 13:20.333
Toby wants me to stay here, and...

13:20.724 --> 13:22.869
And now I'm worried that I'm
being unfair to you and John.

13:27.375 --> 13:30.877
You do what you think
is best for your baby.

13:32.003 --> 13:33.898
The rest of us will fall in line.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.500
I want to be with my family.

13:38.470 --> 13:39.852
I want to go home.

13:46.445 --> 13:48.410

14:03.995 --> 14:05.618
Now you're ready for action.

14:07.148 --> 14:08.381
Hey, have you talked to Bay?

14:10.516 --> 14:12.730
Oh, right. The T-shirts.

14:15.892 --> 14:17.056
- Hey!
- Hi!

14:17.097 --> 14:18.725
Hey, honey! Mingo.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.735
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:19.794 --> 14:21.559
I'm so glad you guys made it!

14:21.679 --> 14:23.888
Mingo: Lookin' good,
guys. Digging the hats.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.670
I had to wrangle this one.

14:25.682 --> 14:26.929
He claims he has two left feet.

14:26.974 --> 14:28.744
Hey, you'll see. Don't
say I didn't warn you.

14:28.753 --> 14:31.245
Hey, maybe the mechanical
bull is more your speed.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.653
It'd probably be safer.

14:35.134 --> 14:37.069
Nuh-uh. Come on, cowboy.

14:37.070 --> 14:38.558
- Let's break you in.
- (Groans)

14:38.580 --> 14:41.304
- Cool if I put my phone in your jacket?
- Sure.

15:03.131 --> 15:05.474
Buy 50, I'll give you 10% off.

15:06.201 --> 15:08.515
Awesome. Go kappas.

15:10.444 --> 15:11.844
What do you need?

15:12.180 --> 15:14.909
Actually, it's you who needs something...

15:14.922 --> 15:16.909
to stop selling this shirt.

15:17.029 --> 15:18.055
Why would I do that?

15:18.388 --> 15:21.569
Because I created this girl

15:21.583 --> 15:25.410
and you are using her
without my permission.

15:25.530 --> 15:27.894
I found it on the side
of a dumpster in an alley.

15:28.268 --> 15:30.530
Was I supposed to run around
looking for the artist?

15:30.944 --> 15:32.580
Okay, fine.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.635
Now I'm telling you it's
mine, and you need to stop.

15:36.371 --> 15:38.004
Ever hear of fair use?

15:38.362 --> 15:40.488
Legally, I can use your
intellectual property,

15:40.492 --> 15:41.574
in this case, art,

15:41.609 --> 15:44.056
so long as I "A," substantially alter it,

15:44.069 --> 15:46.112
and "B," make a statement with my work.

15:46.595 --> 15:49.132
You replaced a diploma with a beer can.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.953
A substantial change, I'd argue.

15:50.953 --> 15:52.778
Do you not realize that you are basically

15:52.799 --> 15:54.901
just encouraging guys to rape?

15:55.279 --> 15:57.631
Who said the T-shirt is talking about sex?

15:58.022 --> 16:00.003
You're the one who's making it about sex.

16:00.028 --> 16:00.867
Oh, please.

16:00.913 --> 16:04.109
"No" could mean "no" to going
skydiving or going dancing.

16:04.229 --> 16:06.045
See, that's what I love about art.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.445
It's so subjective.

16:07.495 --> 16:09.265
Can't you make your misogynist jokes

16:09.281 --> 16:11.297
without dragging my art into it?

16:11.380 --> 16:13.067
I'm sorry you're offended,

16:13.304 --> 16:15.708
but I have no intention of
discontinuing this shirt.

16:15.743 --> 16:17.000
It's one of my best-sellers.

16:17.042 --> 16:20.120
You are an arrogant,
sexist, bottom-feeding thief!

16:20.199 --> 16:22.122
- (Cell phone rings)
- I've been called worse.

16:22.467 --> 16:23.194
Hey...

16:23.257 --> 16:24.617
Grab a shirt before you go.

We're gonna do the "sweetheart" dance

17:00.053 --> 17:01.847

17:01.883 --> 17:02.981
Partner up, partner...

17:03.015 --> 17:04.960
Your mom is a dancing machine.

17:04.992 --> 17:09.347
Yep. Ballet, tap, and
apparently country dancing.

17:09.401 --> 17:11.022
Well, obviously it runs in the family.

17:11.059 --> 17:12.343
I get the sense you've done this before.

17:12.367 --> 17:13.922
Well, it's always a good idea

17:13.954 --> 17:16.402
for a DJ to have an eclectic taste.

17:16.817 --> 17:17.923
And you should be good at this.

17:17.931 --> 17:19.547
It's not that different from river dance.

17:19.614 --> 17:20.740
That's Irish.

17:20.763 --> 17:22.944
I know. I'm just messing with you.

17:23.170 --> 17:25.384
- Now try to keep up.
- Okay.

Did you invite him?

17:34.477 --> 17:35.890
No, um...

17:36.010 --> 17:38.795
Daphne put a notice on the
deaf program's message board.

17:38.915 --> 17:41.080
I'm sure he's just trying to be supportive.

17:43.070 --> 17:45.226
Um... I'm gonna grab a drink real quick.

17:45.493 --> 17:46.725
Okay.

17:50.909 --> 17:52.979
Bay: Six months to go to court?

17:53.298 --> 17:55.816
Well, isn't there some
sort of like, really fast

17:55.828 --> 17:59.330
injunction we can slap on him
to stop him in the meantime?

Uh-huh...

Yes. Yes. Um...

18:05.371 --> 18:08.832
My image was technically put
up illegally but the point is,

18:08.852 --> 18:12.160
now he's making T-shirts
that encourage guys to take

18:12.186 --> 18:16.020
a "no" for a "yes," and that
just makes girls look like morons.

18:17.811 --> 18:20.868
- Well, slogans like that should be illegal.
- (Phone beeps)

18:23.623 --> 18:24.575
All right. Um...

18:24.596 --> 18:27.084

Hey.

18:35.222 --> 18:36.950
I'm good. What's up?

18:42.683 --> 18:45.655
Something about a beach?

18:52.784 --> 18:54.039
Congratulations.

18:58.580 --> 18:59.840
Yeah?

19:08.882 --> 19:10.473
Mm-hmm...

19:14.148 --> 19:15.445
No pressure.

19:27.060 --> 19:29.116
Okay. Um... I have a lot...

19:29.635 --> 19:31.118
going on right now,

19:31.147 --> 19:32.963
so just let me think about it, okay?

19:41.267 --> 19:43.542
(Country music playing)

19:46.723 --> 19:48.314
<i>â™ª Hey, little missy â™ª</i>

19:51.036 --> 19:52.333
I am so proud of Daphne.

19:52.548 --> 19:54.118
I've been dying to get you alone.

19:54.238 --> 19:55.826
How'd it go with Lily?

19:56.424 --> 19:57.870
Well, we mostly just, you know,

19:57.916 --> 19:59.370
- looked at baby clothes.
- Mm!

19:59.927 --> 20:01.392
That was such a perfect setup.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.852
Getting her alone, talking
to her mom-to-mom...

20:04.297 --> 20:05.739
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

20:05.776 --> 20:07.450
but I didn't convince her to stay.

20:07.509 --> 20:09.070
I didn't expect you to close the deal.

20:09.104 --> 20:11.688
Just tell me how much you nudged
her in the right direction.

20:12.660 --> 20:14.900
Well, actually, I told her
that she shouldn't let us

20:14.920 --> 20:17.210
or anyone else influence her decision.

20:18.523 --> 20:20.056
And why would you say that?

20:20.243 --> 20:24.073
Because she has to do what
she feels is best for her baby,

20:24.497 --> 20:26.342
even if that means moving to London.

20:26.462 --> 20:28.988
Kathryn, where the hell
is this coming from?

20:29.023 --> 20:32.275
Honey, if Bay or Daphne were
pregnant and living in London,

20:32.308 --> 20:35.062
wouldn't you hope they would
want to come home to us?

20:35.220 --> 20:36.487
That is a hypothetical.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.187
But here is the reality.

20:38.374 --> 20:40.352
Lily is carrying our grandchild

20:40.398 --> 20:43.971
and threatening to raise him
or her in a foreign country.

20:44.091 --> 20:45.716
That is unacceptable.

20:45.721 --> 20:47.880
If we are going to be good grandparents,

20:47.901 --> 20:50.814
we need to put the baby and
Lily's needs before our own.

20:50.934 --> 20:52.234
Well, call me selfish.

20:52.313 --> 20:54.660

<i>â™ª I know he's somewhere â™ª</i>

21:19.456 --> 21:22.406
<i>â™ª in this bar now â™ª</i>

21:22.526 --> 21:28.139
<i>â™ª yeah, he's somewhere
right in this bar â™ª</i>

21:35.534 --> 21:39.090
I just have to focus on
Pati and the other students.

21:39.142 --> 21:43.111
I want everyone to really
understand what's at stake here.

21:43.146 --> 21:45.113
Hey, you're gonna do great.

21:45.148 --> 21:46.297
Thanks.

21:46.687 --> 21:48.893
- Where's the mic?
- Oh. Um...

21:50.397 --> 21:51.735
Hey, what the hell?

21:52.068 --> 21:54.738
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm about to give a presentation

21:54.744 --> 21:56.177
for the fundraiser that we're holding.

21:56.218 --> 21:58.150
What fundraiser? I don't
know anything about this.

21:58.229 --> 21:59.995
Um, okay. I cleared it with Joe.

22:00.013 --> 22:01.640
- The bartender.
- Joe...

22:01.695 --> 22:03.814
Joe has no authority to approve this.

22:03.830 --> 22:05.354
If you could just give me two minutes,

22:05.371 --> 22:07.980
- I could explain to you what it is and I'm sure...
- Listen. Listen to me.

22:08.005 --> 22:09.469
I don't do fundraisers.

22:09.497 --> 22:10.723
It's bad for business.

22:10.735 --> 22:12.407
Now, you can follow my rules,

22:12.459 --> 22:13.808
or leave the premises.

22:14.358 --> 22:16.678
<i>â™ª I'm still working on â™ª</i>

22:17.072 --> 22:18.680
I am so sorry.

22:19.353 --> 22:21.316
No. It's not your fault.

22:24.252 --> 22:27.247
You know, there is one other
way we can raise this money.

22:27.324 --> 22:28.289
How?

22:28.855 --> 22:30.646
$500 prize.

22:31.469 --> 22:33.426
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

22:33.504 --> 22:36.229
I think I got a bull to tame.

22:38.445 --> 22:39.968
(Sighs)

22:55.532 --> 22:56.563
Toby.

22:58.291 --> 22:59.243
What?

23:00.169 --> 23:01.614
He was just saying hello.

23:02.026 --> 23:03.741
He clearly has a thing for you,

23:03.777 --> 23:05.576
and we both know you had a thing for him.

23:05.587 --> 23:08.001
Had. Past tense. And like I've told you

23:08.039 --> 23:09.809
a thousand times, nothing happened.

23:09.966 --> 23:12.056
Then how come every time
I see you two together,

23:12.068 --> 23:13.452
you totally seem into each other?

23:13.456 --> 23:16.386
And every time he's around,
you seem insanely jealous.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.102
Then stop giving me a reason to be!

23:18.274 --> 23:20.786
Julian and I are colleagues, nothing more.

23:21.035 --> 23:22.693
I don't want you talking to him anymore.

23:22.892 --> 23:24.330
You don't have the right to tell me

23:24.334 --> 23:25.942
who I can and can't talk to.

23:26.062 --> 23:27.313
So, you get to do whatever you want,

23:27.338 --> 23:28.664
and I just have to live with it?

23:29.611 --> 23:32.170
If you're talking about London,
I haven't made a decision yet.

23:32.523 --> 23:34.867
"I"? It's an "I" decision now?

23:35.445 --> 23:36.973
I didn't mean it like that.

23:37.007 --> 23:38.444
- I meant...
- I'm the baby's father

23:38.602 --> 23:39.861
and I have rights, too.

23:39.863 --> 23:41.706
And I say we're not moving to London.

23:42.396 --> 23:44.083
If I want to move to London,

23:44.241 --> 23:45.678
I don't need your permission.

23:45.994 --> 23:47.452
I can move without you.

23:47.502 --> 23:49.003
And the way you're behaving right now,

23:49.123 --> 23:50.793
you're making the decision pretty clear.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.857
Creative license, apparently.

24:04.665 --> 24:09.114
It's pretentious for
"it's totally fine to steal

24:09.143 --> 24:12.788
someone's identity or life
experience and ruin it."

24:13.102 --> 24:16.069
Sometimes I really hate art.

24:20.869 --> 24:22.648
Yeah. She was.

24:22.891 --> 24:24.350
Now, she's a drunk.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.296
Thanks, but I already talked to a lawyer,

24:37.459 --> 24:41.281
and even if I stopped this
guy from selling those shirts,

24:41.289 --> 24:42.427
it would take months.

24:42.593 --> 24:45.149
So, I'm destined to see my work

24:45.573 --> 24:49.553
bastardized on the chests
of freshmen girls all year.

24:50.035 --> 24:53.367
Yeah. Sometimes I wonder
what these girls would think

24:53.392 --> 24:56.251
if their moms saw them
wearing these shirts.

24:56.309 --> 25:00.347
Like, "oh hey, ma! Look at me! I'm a lush!"

25:02.856 --> 25:04.190
Oh, my god.

25:06.537 --> 25:07.285
(Scoffs)

25:08.165 --> 25:10.562
She cannot cross international waters

25:10.598 --> 25:12.777
with your baby without
your permission, okay?

25:12.794 --> 25:13.713
You tell her

25:13.730 --> 25:15.919
we will take her to court
for custody if we have to.

25:15.952 --> 25:18.495
- Dad!
- Toby, this is your child, too, all right?

25:18.515 --> 25:21.594
We will sue her and her family
and everything that moves

25:21.609 --> 25:23.858
if she thinks she can make
these unilateral decisions

25:23.870 --> 25:26.068
- like this...
- You want me to tell her I'll sue her?

25:26.251 --> 25:28.266
You really think that's
seriously the best way

25:28.291 --> 25:29.920
to get her to change her mind?

25:34.124 --> 25:35.330
I don't even wanna know.

25:35.604 --> 25:37.461
All right. All right...

25:38.371 --> 25:39.727
We gotta do something.

25:41.178 --> 25:42.747
Okay. Well, I've been thinking...

25:42.934 --> 25:45.198
I meant what I said. That I want her

25:45.232 --> 25:47.662
to be where she feels supported, but...

25:48.102 --> 25:50.159
I think we can provide that, too.

25:50.183 --> 25:52.206
Yeah. What I've been sayin'!

25:52.696 --> 25:56.684
Well, I think we need to show
her that we're really serious...

25:57.094 --> 25:58.957
By sweetening the pot a little.

25:59.003 --> 26:00.062
Fine.

26:00.573 --> 26:01.714
How?

26:03.684 --> 26:05.851
(Cheering and applause)

26:08.343 --> 26:11.737
Announcer: <i>Okay, our next rider
hails from right here in Kansas City!</i>

26:11.770 --> 26:13.926
(Cheering and applause)

26:14.691 --> 26:16.612
Sure you don't want to
give it a try, cowboy?

26:16.664 --> 26:17.746
I'll pass.

26:17.782 --> 26:19.941
Announcer: Let's all give a
rousing hoot and holler now

26:19.966 --> 26:21.807
for Greg "Mingo" Shimingo!

26:21.836 --> 26:23.384
Come on, big man!

26:23.826 --> 26:25.404
Kathryn: You can do it!

26:25.439 --> 26:26.830
This is for you, babe!

26:27.660 --> 26:30.606
- Announcer: Are you ready?
- Let's do this!

26:32.916 --> 26:34.329
(Air horn)

26:34.382 --> 26:36.098
(Crowd cheers)

26:36.133 --> 26:37.483
(Crowd gasps)

26:39.286 --> 26:40.936
- Mingo!
- (Groans)

26:42.514 --> 26:44.757
- Are you okay?
- (Groans)

26:44.799 --> 26:45.825
That is...

26:46.361 --> 26:48.214
Way harder than it looks.

26:49.609 --> 26:52.094
Announcer: Oh, a little
short, but a great ride

26:52.139 --> 26:54.900
from Greg "Mingo" Shimingo! Come on, folks!

26:55.264 --> 26:56.531
I'm sorry.

26:57.765 --> 26:59.688
I wanted to win that money for you.

27:00.375 --> 27:02.781
It's okay. We're not done yet.

27:02.980 --> 27:03.959
We're not?

27:04.775 --> 27:07.679
They have a ladies competition as well.

27:08.772 --> 27:09.565
(Scoffs)

27:13.330 --> 27:15.739
Ladies, I got "walk of shame" shirts.

27:15.777 --> 27:18.457
It's funny 'cause it's true. Buy
one, get one free. One night only.

27:18.492 --> 27:19.625
Hilarious.

27:19.660 --> 27:21.915
Pleasure doing business with you.

27:25.416 --> 27:26.215
Mom?

27:26.250 --> 27:27.399
What are you doing here?

27:27.602 --> 27:29.181
What the hell is this?

27:29.837 --> 27:32.546
- Hi.
- You seriously told my mom?

27:32.666 --> 27:34.039
Yes, she did.

27:34.091 --> 27:37.976
Hey, mothers thrive off the
accomplishments of their children, right?

27:38.135 --> 27:41.914
I just thought she should know
what a great business you have.

27:42.034 --> 27:43.849
How did you even know how to find her?

27:44.062 --> 27:46.048
Oh, it wasn't that hard actually.

27:46.052 --> 27:47.257
You're Facebook friends with her,

27:47.282 --> 27:48.922
so I just sent her a link to your site.

27:48.923 --> 27:51.461
How is "I am blackout drunk" funny?

27:51.764 --> 27:53.663
I'm not making anyone buy them.

27:53.692 --> 27:56.015
You are going to stop this right now.

27:56.027 --> 27:58.956
They're grown women, but you're
treating them like children.

27:59.076 --> 28:01.000
Aren't they smart enough
to make up their own minds

28:01.012 --> 28:02.601
about what to put on their bodies?

28:02.653 --> 28:05.537
Isn't the women's
movement all about choice?

28:05.856 --> 28:08.574
Bottom line... if girls are dumb enough

28:08.592 --> 28:11.669
to wear shirts like that,
that's not my problem.

28:11.789 --> 28:13.991
I'm just making a buck off their stupidity.

28:14.435 --> 28:16.267
Right now, I couldn't be prouder.

28:20.039 --> 28:21.818
Wait, did you just record that?

28:21.938 --> 28:23.126
Yep. Sure did.

28:23.143 --> 28:24.950
Vine is gonna love this one.

28:29.454 --> 28:31.930
Okay, just go with the
momentum of the bull.

28:31.947 --> 28:32.997
Don't try and fight it.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.167
Right, like I'm gonna
take advice from someone

28:35.169 --> 28:37.433
- who didn't even last one second?
- Yeah.

28:37.469 --> 28:39.626
That's good. That's good.
Keep that mean attitude.

28:39.655 --> 28:41.106
Use that fire to stay on the bull.

28:41.450 --> 28:43.797
Announcer: Our next competitor
in the ladies division...

28:44.046 --> 28:45.355
<i>Daphne Vasquez!</i>

28:45.422 --> 28:46.622
Okay, you're up.

28:46.742 --> 28:48.280
The time to beat is six seconds.

28:48.318 --> 28:49.664
Piece of cake.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.034
- Come on!
- (Cheering and applause)

28:52.086 --> 28:53.337
Go, Daphne!

28:54.716 --> 28:57.459
<i>â™ª Fill the tank and don't look back â™ª</i>

28:57.634 --> 28:59.183
Go get 'em!

28:59.219 --> 29:00.973
Announcer: Are you ready, little lady?

29:01.007 --> 29:04.057
<i>â™ª 'Cause that's what crazy girls do â™ª</i>

29:04.177 --> 29:06.816
- (Air horn)
- (Cheering and applause)

29:06.936 --> 29:11.897
<i>â™ª Not afraid to jump
off a cliff or two â™ª</i>

29:12.017 --> 29:17.677
<i>â™ª that's what crazy girls do â™ª</i>

29:17.888 --> 29:22.146
<i>â™ª not afraid to jump

29:22.359 --> 29:24.058
(Crowd gasps)

29:25.450 --> 29:27.795
Babe, you were amazing!

29:27.831 --> 29:30.639
Announcer: That was a great
ride, but a little too short.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.446
Not amazing enough.

29:33.015 --> 29:35.019
Announcer: She's one tough cookie, folks!

29:35.055 --> 29:37.310
Give it up for Daphne Vasquez!

29:39.059 --> 29:40.958
(Cheering and applause)

29:41.011 --> 29:43.845
<i>â™ª Crazy girls like me and you â™ª</i>

29:47.427 --> 29:48.519
Eric!

29:48.972 --> 29:50.335
What is going on?

29:50.587 --> 29:52.636
- (Angrily) Just drop it, okay?
- Eric,

29:53.235 --> 29:54.518
what is the matter?

29:54.534 --> 29:55.980
This is what's the matter.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.385
You want to tell me how a
receipt got in your pocket

29:58.439 --> 30:01.396
from the auto body shop
where my ex-wife works?

30:01.901 --> 30:03.081
Okay, let me explain.

30:03.118 --> 30:04.614
- You went to Atlanta?
- I should have told you.

30:04.643 --> 30:05.819
I know that.

30:05.856 --> 30:07.293
Does she know who you
are? That we're together?

30:07.331 --> 30:08.963
No. Absolutely not.

30:08.976 --> 30:10.256
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

30:10.293 --> 30:11.943
I was careful. I swear.

30:14.128 --> 30:15.292
So you didn't trust me.

30:15.830 --> 30:17.667
I had to see it for myself...

30:18.344 --> 30:20.314
Before I got more involved with you.

30:22.285 --> 30:23.354
You know what?

30:27.023 --> 30:28.394
I'll find my own way home.

30:30.326 --> 30:32.208
Eric. Eric!

30:39.634 --> 30:41.521
You know, we never really talked

30:41.903 --> 30:43.191
about... him.

30:43.562 --> 30:44.508
Who? Julian?

30:44.865 --> 30:45.771
Yeah, we did.

30:45.829 --> 30:47.550
- I said...
- You said nothing happened,

30:47.612 --> 30:49.212
but the feelings were real...

30:50.142 --> 30:52.336
And we just pushed right past them because

30:52.660 --> 30:53.579
this happened.

30:55.626 --> 30:59.399
Would we still be together
if you hadn't got pregnant?

31:00.284 --> 31:01.722
I hope so.

31:03.155 --> 31:04.746
Do you wish that I was him?

31:05.278 --> 31:07.059
Of course not.

31:12.016 --> 31:13.736
Then what was it about him?

31:17.940 --> 31:21.114
I grew up with double
the expectations on me

31:21.887 --> 31:23.142
because of my brother.

31:23.609 --> 31:24.642
And...

31:25.066 --> 31:28.224
Julian was the kind of guy
that I thought I should be with.

31:29.911 --> 31:32.225
Stable, more money...

31:33.006 --> 31:35.806
Somebody who could give me
the life I thought I wanted.

31:36.471 --> 31:37.568
Stable...

31:38.104 --> 31:39.105
traditional.

31:39.391 --> 31:40.314
Yeah.

31:43.023 --> 31:44.265
And look at you now.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.010
I know.

31:48.589 --> 31:50.168
But I couldn't be happier.

31:50.762 --> 31:51.937
I promise.

31:54.895 --> 31:56.939
I love you, Toby.

31:57.679 --> 32:01.085
And I know we got back
together in an unexpected way,

32:01.276 --> 32:04.147
but the minute we broke
up, I wanted you back.

32:07.226 --> 32:08.185
Me, too.

32:23.532 --> 32:24.768
(Sighs)

32:34.305 --> 32:35.512
(Sighs)

32:38.106 --> 32:39.689
It's not just the shirts.

32:40.682 --> 32:43.171
Hammer girl is officially dead.

32:47.392 --> 32:50.500
But she doesn't belong to me anymore.

32:52.281 --> 32:54.331
She had a great run.

32:54.366 --> 32:57.928
She was our symbol during
the Carlton protest,

32:58.348 --> 33:00.520
I sent her to Afghanistan with Ty.

33:01.035 --> 33:02.405
I leaned on her

33:02.441 --> 33:04.708
a lot over the years, and...

33:07.035 --> 33:10.495
I think now it's time to say goodbye.

33:18.564 --> 33:21.505
It's been four years since I created her,

33:21.535 --> 33:25.448
and I haven't come up with
anything half as good since.

33:30.778 --> 33:34.376
But what if she's the
best thing I'll ever do?

34:03.682 --> 34:04.513
(Scoffs)

34:10.849 --> 34:12.996
You know, I never thought
that you would become

34:13.025 --> 34:16.495
one of my best friends, but you are.

34:27.614 --> 34:28.545
Thank you.

34:37.969 --> 34:39.456
I think I'm gonna stay here,

34:39.731 --> 34:43.237
figure out my next amazing idea.

34:49.686 --> 34:50.780
(Sighs)

35:06.617 --> 35:07.846
Mingo: Whoa!

35:07.888 --> 35:10.256
- That can't all be from the hat.
- Nah.

35:10.281 --> 35:12.184
I gave my speech to the manager.

35:12.346 --> 35:13.837
I was pretty sure

35:13.862 --> 35:16.335
that I could change his mind
if he just gave me a chance.

35:16.372 --> 35:18.902
- And you did!
- No. Not at all,

35:19.056 --> 35:22.009
but the lady who won
the bull riding contest

35:22.043 --> 35:25.297
was sitting nearby and she was quite moved

35:25.324 --> 35:26.791
by what I had to say.

35:26.861 --> 35:31.319
After settling her bar tab, she gave
me what was left of her winnings.

35:31.369 --> 35:32.951
Plus what was in the hat...

35:32.980 --> 35:36.200
Totaled $687!

35:36.495 --> 35:37.817
That's awesome!

35:37.854 --> 35:38.922
Yes!

35:40.432 --> 35:41.971
I couldn't have done it without you.

35:42.391 --> 35:44.756
I can't wait to tell Quinn!

35:47.328 --> 35:49.497
You're still talking with that guy?

35:49.530 --> 35:53.805
Yeah, but just about Pati, the program.

35:53.925 --> 35:55.570
You should have told me.

35:55.753 --> 35:58.114
Told you what? There's nothing going on.

35:58.166 --> 35:59.621
He kissed you.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.382
- But...
- But what?

36:01.449 --> 36:03.771
It's weird that you're talking
with this guy and arranging

36:03.792 --> 36:05.989
this whole fundraiser with
him, and I didn't know about it.

36:08.371 --> 36:09.260
(Sighs)

36:12.156 --> 36:13.303
(Sighs)

36:18.788 --> 36:19.997
(Door opens)

36:23.607 --> 36:24.766
Will's in bed.

36:25.314 --> 36:27.570
I told him you would check
on him when you got home.

36:34.325 --> 36:36.108
Look, are you gonna say anything?

36:38.214 --> 36:39.332
What did you say to her?

36:40.689 --> 36:41.888
What was she like?

36:42.875 --> 36:44.505
She fixed my rental car.

36:44.667 --> 36:45.992
She seemed fine.

36:46.428 --> 36:47.761
Nice even...

36:48.931 --> 36:50.761
Until I realized she was working

36:50.765 --> 36:52.589
with her husband to sell drugs.

36:53.109 --> 36:54.072
Like I told you?

36:54.093 --> 36:55.630
- I know.
- (Sighs)

36:57.284 --> 36:59.623
You told me you were going
to go see your cousins...

36:59.947 --> 37:00.911
In Ohio.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.960
You looked right at me and...

37:02.972 --> 37:04.838
It was a bad lie.

37:04.958 --> 37:06.379
I know that.

37:07.073 --> 37:08.947
But it was important that I know.

37:10.185 --> 37:11.400
- (Sighs)
- Look...

37:11.520 --> 37:13.370
We have got to get past this.

37:13.405 --> 37:14.654
You have to forgive me.

37:14.656 --> 37:16.488
It's not just the lie.

37:17.299 --> 37:18.919
It's that you endangered Will!

37:19.039 --> 37:20.809
But it's been months.

37:21.263 --> 37:22.596
And he's fine.

37:22.974 --> 37:24.702
You're both fine.

37:25.259 --> 37:26.381
Please.

37:30.138 --> 37:31.292
I'm going to bed.

37:40.048 --> 37:42.132
Mingo, wait! Can we talk?

37:42.498 --> 37:43.529
Yeah, we could...

37:43.649 --> 37:45.357
Or you could call Quinn and talk with him

37:45.373 --> 37:47.683
since you seem to be
doing a lot of that lately.

37:48.273 --> 37:51.039
I'm so sorry I didn't tell
you that we'd been talking.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.649
The trip...

37:56.037 --> 37:57.716
Changed something in me...

37:58.000 --> 38:00.901
And he and I have this bond over that.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.370
That you and I don't have.

38:04.039 --> 38:07.273
You and I see each other every day.

38:07.393 --> 38:09.084
We go mountain biking

38:09.138 --> 38:11.289
and drink mint chip shakes at midnight.

38:11.364 --> 38:13.683
But it's not a profound bond about

38:13.757 --> 38:15.324
changing people's lives.

38:16.122 --> 38:16.936
Mingo...

38:16.974 --> 38:18.731
It's cool. I get it.

38:20.526 --> 38:22.229
There is nothing

38:22.437 --> 38:24.691
going on with him. I swear.

38:25.998 --> 38:26.900
Okay.

38:27.810 --> 38:30.530
Do you want to go get mint chip shakes?

38:31.241 --> 38:33.136
I was just about to suggest that.

38:33.198 --> 38:34.718
Let me go grab my wallet.

38:36.804 --> 38:38.521
(Phone vibrates)

38:47.372 --> 38:49.516
(Door opens) Okay.

38:49.636 --> 38:50.717
Let's hit it.

38:57.163 --> 38:58.929
Yeah, it's fine with me.

38:59.511 --> 39:00.629
You made it.

39:00.629 --> 39:02.435
You should have control over it.

39:09.538 --> 39:11.009
I'm fine.

39:12.126 --> 39:14.431
I'm starting a new project, actually.

39:16.775 --> 39:18.088
I don't know yet.

39:18.275 --> 39:20.165
But I think there's something...

39:20.825 --> 39:24.455
something about the
way we define ourselves.

39:34.001 --> 39:35.252
He's good!

39:35.611 --> 39:39.366
Actually, he's been a
really amazing friend lately.

39:39.401 --> 39:41.267
We just... (Sighs)

39:41.303 --> 39:44.024
We have a lot in common.

39:45.131 --> 39:46.439
Anyway...

39:50.145 --> 39:51.867
I should go.

39:51.987 --> 39:55.659
Good luck with the festival and everything.

40:00.535 --> 40:04.957
<i>â™ª Love was made for giving â™ª</i>

40:05.077 --> 40:07.976
<i>â™ª what are you saving for â™ª</i>

40:08.213 --> 40:13.716
<i>â™ª this is it, this is it â™ª</i>

40:18.739 --> 40:21.772
Hey, thanks so much for
coming by. We know it's late.

40:21.892 --> 40:23.993
It's cool. We wanted to talk to you, too.

40:24.354 --> 40:25.985
Us first. Um...

40:26.198 --> 40:28.110
Kathryn and I have done a lot of thinking

40:28.116 --> 40:30.502
about your dilemma, and...

40:30.622 --> 40:33.092
We've realized that if you're
gonna stay in Kansas City,

40:33.121 --> 40:36.404
you will need a lot more from
us than just baby clothes.

40:36.841 --> 40:38.540
Kathryn: We want you to know that

40:38.556 --> 40:40.954
we will be with you every step of the way.

40:40.974 --> 40:42.653
And with that in mind,

40:43.027 --> 40:44.572
we are willing to offer

40:44.597 --> 40:47.381
whatever financial support you might need.

40:47.936 --> 40:49.316
I thought money was tight.

40:49.374 --> 40:50.488
We'll figure it out.

40:50.608 --> 40:52.619
We'll sell this house if we have to.

40:52.974 --> 40:54.022
- Wow.
- Yeah.

40:54.056 --> 40:56.276
That's very generous of you,
but you don't have to do that.

40:56.311 --> 40:57.766
Kathryn: And that's not all.

40:57.808 --> 40:59.462
If you'll let me, I'd like to offer

40:59.487 --> 41:01.527
full-time daycare to the baby.

41:04.933 --> 41:05.905
Uh...

41:06.379 --> 41:07.758
we really appreciate it.

41:07.787 --> 41:09.977
- Yeah.
- We do, but...

41:10.413 --> 41:12.074
It's not gonna be necessary.

41:12.499 --> 41:13.620
Um...

41:14.260 --> 41:15.703
we've decided...

41:16.982 --> 41:18.264
to move to London.
