WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:05.879
(Kurt) Got it. I'd shag Penny and die.

00:05.879 --> 00:08.239
Penny's not here so it doesn't count.

00:08.239 --> 00:11.669
Only those who survived
the plane crash, i.e. us.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.899
All right, then.
I'd eat Brian and shag Jenny.

00:15.839 --> 00:18.078
You'd eat me? You git.

00:18.079 --> 00:21.079
You either eat Jenny and live
or shag her and die.

00:21.079 --> 00:24.560
- I'd shag her and die.
- I'd have to be in a coma to let you.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.119
Whatever.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.798
(Mobile)

00:28.799 --> 00:30.040
Alec, hi.

00:30.040 --> 00:32.079
- He's away for the week.
- Where to?

00:32.079 --> 00:34.640
A course to find his inner self.
Probably naked.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.930
Yeah, Kurt does that.
Only it's called wanking.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.919
- (Brian) Whose go is it?
- JP's. What about Kurt?

00:40.919 --> 00:42.679
I'd eat him, obviously.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.279
Like eating that Fantasy Island midget.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.520
- Wouldn't keep you going.
- Fuck off.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.120
To survive a plane crash
you'd want a fat bastard like Bob.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.760
- Keep you going for days.
- Forget the crash, I'd kill Bob anyway.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.398
What's he done?

00:56.399 --> 00:58.719
Just made my working life a misery.

00:58.719 --> 01:00.319
He makes you work?

01:00.320 --> 01:03.800
She's the one that takes the piss
out of me, not you.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.559
I'm having a night off.

01:05.560 --> 01:09.159
Maybe I should change my name
to Penny. It'd be easier.

01:09.159 --> 01:11.399
You look like more of a Pauline.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.960
I'd just stick my tits out
and I'd get away with anything.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.359
That's unfair.
Penny's tits stick out by themselves.

01:18.359 --> 01:20.999
- He's got a point.
- What did we used to talk about

01:20.999 --> 01:23.880
- before Penny and her tits?
- Tits in general.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.639
- There's more to her than her tits.
- Is there?

01:26.639 --> 01:29.000
All I'm... I look more like a Pauline?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
♪ She paints her nails
and she don't know

01:33.040 --> 01:35.760
♪ He's got her best friend
on the phone

01:35.760 --> 01:37.040
♪ She'll wash her hair

01:37.040 --> 01:39.799
♪ His dirty clothes

01:39.800 --> 01:42.399

♪ Her boyfriend, he don't know

01:56.359 --> 01:59.279
♪ Anything about her

01:59.280 --> 02:01.198
♪ He's too stoned

02:01.199 --> 02:03.200
- ♪ Nintendo... ♪
- Morning, Bob.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.200
♪ I wish that I could make her see

02:08.758 --> 02:11.279
♪ She's just the flavour of the weak

02:18.640 --> 02:21.319
♪ It's Friday night

02:21.319 --> 02:23.318
- Good weekend?
- No.

02:23.319 --> 02:25.518
Why? Were you missing me?

02:25.519 --> 02:27.558
- Joke.
- Yeah. Good one.

02:27.559 --> 02:30.359
Just to let you know,
we're up to chapter seven.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.579
- Chapter seven of...
- To Kill A Mockingbird.

02:33.719 --> 02:35.439
Right. Well done.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.760
Do you know what I'm talking about?

02:37.760 --> 02:39.559
Yeah.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.560
- No.
- I'm Jenny this morning.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.438
You're taking my class.

02:43.439 --> 02:46.880
- I've got a free period.
- It was timetabled ages ago.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.570
- Sorry, is this going to be a problem?
- No, it's absolutely fine.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.198
Since when has this been here?

02:57.199 --> 03:00.199
Since you started teaching here.

03:00.319 --> 03:04.560
You've got to hand it to her. Ten to nine
Monday, she's started already.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.918
Who's started what?

03:06.919 --> 03:10.559
- She's just being friendly.
- Oh, Brian, you're so sweet.

03:10.559 --> 03:12.918
False tits, false personality.

03:12.919 --> 03:15.638
- See?
- She'd use anyone. Ask Carol.

03:15.639 --> 03:18.119
- Doesn't Carol worship her?
- She does.

03:18.119 --> 03:22.560
I'm trying to get her to say no to Penny
in a firm but polite way

03:22.560 --> 03:26.060
that may probably include
the words "piss", "off",

03:26.400 --> 03:29.400
"selfish" and "cow".

03:31.360 --> 03:34.080
(Clare) Just some things
to update you with.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.039
We have new stock coming in,

03:36.039 --> 03:40.080
largely due to Jeremy Stevens
collecting 2,000 crisp packets

03:40.080 --> 03:42.319
in the school equipment promotion.

03:42.319 --> 03:43.679
Greedy fucker.

03:43.679 --> 03:46.959
Next, in response to an issue raised
at the last PTA,

03:46.959 --> 03:50.440
I've been looking to improve
pupil-teacher relations.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.759
It struck me some pupils
may have a specific problem

03:53.759 --> 03:56.919
they feel unable to go
to their personal tutor with.

03:56.919 --> 04:00.399
Something they'd prefer
to talk over with another teacher.

04:00.399 --> 04:03.549
Which is why
I'm introducing an open surgery,

04:04.119 --> 04:07.119
or an open door policy
just for this week.

04:07.319 --> 04:12.160
Pupils from any year can choose to see
any member of staff if they need to.

04:12.160 --> 04:15.520
Sometimes you really feel
like she's on our side.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.519
Unless anybody
has a problem with that.

04:19.879 --> 04:22.879
No, it's a really good idea.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.319
- Good.
- (JP) There was something, Clare.

04:25.319 --> 04:28.560
When are we supposed to have
these open surgeries?

04:28.560 --> 04:31.560
Break times, free periods, lunch hours.

04:32.159 --> 04:35.640
Though I don't expect you
to give up all your free time.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.798
That's a relief, then.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.299
So, everyone happy?

04:40.040 --> 04:43.040
Marvellous.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.759
There's no point you giving me this now.
I needed it earlier.

04:46.759 --> 04:49.759
Look, it's just not good enough.

04:51.599 --> 04:54.599
- What's up?
- I forgot...

04:56.599 --> 04:58.759
(Sighs heavily)

04:58.760 --> 05:02.820
Don't worry. Tell Clare
I'll cover lunchtime duty for Ken.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.598
Thanks.

05:04.599 --> 05:08.840
OK, chapters five and six.
Did you cover metaphorical intention?

05:08.840 --> 05:11.079
Yes, but I'm not sure they took it in.

05:11.079 --> 05:13.959
It's hard to cram everything
into one lesson.

05:13.959 --> 05:16.360
Maybe it's your lesson plan.
Can I see it?

05:16.360 --> 05:19.360
Sure.

05:22.799 --> 05:25.799
God, there's so much junk in here.

05:27.159 --> 05:30.159
Shit, I think I've left it in my drawer.

05:30.439 --> 05:33.439
Sorry, Jenny. Can I give it to you later?

05:33.960 --> 05:36.439
OK, let's move on to interpretation.

05:36.439 --> 05:40.400
What did you do on how Scout compares
to other female protagonists?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.480
I think I tackled the main points

05:42.480 --> 05:46.600
but I wasn't sure whether to start
with 20th-century characters.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.959
- Or maybe that's too obvious.
- No, I don't think so.

05:49.959 --> 05:54.439
It's just trying to approach it
in a way that gets them interested.

05:54.439 --> 05:56.438
Is there a secret to it?

05:56.439 --> 05:58.840
If there is, I haven't discovered it.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.440
I wouldn't say that
from visiting your lessons.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.279
Have you always been so confident?

06:03.279 --> 06:06.279
No, I'm actually very timid.

06:06.479 --> 06:08.639
You're trying to make me feel better.

06:08.639 --> 06:10.598
Yes.

06:10.599 --> 06:14.449
So how do I get to at least appear
as confident as you?

06:14.960 --> 06:17.358
OK, let's think.

06:17.359 --> 06:22.119
Frightening them to death
so they're in fear of you forever is good.

06:23.639 --> 06:25.438
(Kids chattering)

06:25.439 --> 06:27.919
Right, come on. Shut it!

06:27.920 --> 06:30.399
Shh. OK.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.840
Write down the answers
to the questions on the board

06:33.840 --> 06:36.159
without talking.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.079
It should take you
to the end of the lesson.

06:39.079 --> 06:42.079
Have fun.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.960
(Clears throat)

06:46.960 --> 06:49.240
I don't think we've done this bit.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.079
Maybe you were asleep
when Miss Neville did it.

06:52.079 --> 06:56.909
No. She just told us to read stuff.
She didn't go through it with us.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.719
But she set questions
for chapters five and six?

06:59.719 --> 07:02.719
(All) No.

07:04.599 --> 07:07.599
OK! Let's go back to chapter five.

07:13.719 --> 07:15.840
- Jem and Dill.
- Which one's Jem?

07:15.840 --> 07:18.840
That's very funny.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.119
You weren't joking, were you?

07:23.120 --> 07:24.599
(Bell)

07:24.599 --> 07:27.439
- Cheers, sir, it wasn't bad.
- Thanks, Ricky.

07:27.439 --> 07:29.519
I take it he was being sarcastic?

07:29.519 --> 07:31.800
I've done some good stuff with them.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.790
- And ruined the good stuff Penny did?
- What good stuff?

07:35.919 --> 07:39.200
Are you being your usual childlike self
or making a point?

07:39.200 --> 07:40.960
No, but now you mention it

07:40.960 --> 07:44.319
I've taught them more in one lesson
than Penny has all term.

07:44.319 --> 07:47.400
- Yeah, right.
- She's more crap than I thought.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.240
- She's not that bad.
- She makes me look good.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.880
- You're such a good role model.
- At least they're learning.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.479
Penny's not covered half the stuff
she's supposed to have.

07:57.479 --> 08:00.480
Yes, she has.
I'm her mentor. I should know.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.560
Or are you trying to say
I can't do my job properly?

08:03.560 --> 08:05.319
What's got into you?

08:05.320 --> 08:08.399
- You're implying I've neglected her.
- I'm not.

08:08.399 --> 08:11.360
But it can't be easy
keeping on top of everything,

08:11.360 --> 08:14.639
doing your job, which you do well -
exceptionally well -

08:14.639 --> 08:16.358
and being a mentor.

08:16.359 --> 08:19.369
- So I'm incapable of doing two jobs?
- No!

08:19.400 --> 08:22.400
- If she was behind, I'd have spotted it.
- OK.

08:22.400 --> 08:26.880
If you think you've done
such a great job, I'll leave you to it.

08:30.519 --> 08:32.198
- Penny.
- Hm.

08:32.200 --> 08:36.240
You'd tell me if you had a problem
with your English class?

08:36.240 --> 08:38.078
Yeah, of course. Why?

08:38.078 --> 08:42.419
Simon got the impression
they were behind in their coursework.

08:42.719 --> 08:46.499
I didn't realise an NQT
was meant to produce geniuses.

08:46.599 --> 08:50.079
- Maybe I should apologise.
- He wasn't criticising you.

08:50.079 --> 08:53.079
He was concerned,
which made me concerned.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.679
I'm trying my best,
it's just not easy sometimes.

08:56.679 --> 08:59.829
- One or two can be really disruptive.
- Who?

09:00.320 --> 09:03.400
- Ricky Sharpe can be a nightmare.
- Can he?

09:03.519 --> 09:06.799
Maybe he's just like that with me
because I'm new.

09:06.799 --> 09:08.299
I'll let you get on.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.519
Kurt can speak to him.
He's in his tutor group.

09:11.519 --> 09:13.600
I don't want to make an issue of it.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.399
He can't get away with it.
Leave it with me.

09:16.399 --> 09:17.899
After you, Jason.

09:19.880 --> 09:23.030
I suppose it comes down
to freedom of choice.

09:23.159 --> 09:27.079
Though it's up to you if you want to buy
your own shin pads.

09:27.079 --> 09:29.158
Was there anything else

09:29.159 --> 09:31.680
apart from hockey
you wanted to ask me?

09:31.680 --> 09:34.680
Why is the sky blue?

09:36.360 --> 09:38.398
Good question, Wayne.

09:38.399 --> 09:41.319
Ah, unfortunately, we're out of time.

10:19.359 --> 10:21.479

I doubt it was on purpose.
It was probably a casual remark.

11:43.599 --> 11:45.839
That's not the impression I got.

11:45.840 --> 11:49.679
I'm sure they're in breach of the NUT
code of professional conduct.

11:49.679 --> 11:51.839
Not that I'd tell my union rep.

11:51.839 --> 11:55.239
No, I can understand you
not wanting to go down that route.

11:55.239 --> 11:57.059
You'd still work together.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.680
Not easy once a hostile atmosphere's
been created.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.399
Do you think
I should've kept this to myself?

12:03.399 --> 12:06.039
No, you did the right thing
in coming to see me

12:06.039 --> 12:08.519
but we don't want to stir up animosity

12:08.519 --> 12:12.579
so it'll be better if I just
have a quiet word with Simon.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.200
I would've brought this up with Jenny

12:15.200 --> 12:17.799
but she's been so busy
with open surgery.

12:17.799 --> 12:21.360
I'm sure the last thing she needs
is being a mentor to me.

12:21.360 --> 12:25.070
Well, if she can't see you,
I don't mind helping out.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.200
- Just for this week.
- But you're busy.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.239
No, I'm sure I can fit you in.

12:29.239 --> 12:33.019
I've got to see Clare.
Let's make a time for tomorrow.

12:33.399 --> 12:34.999
Thanks, Bob.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.279
If you don't mind being stuck
with a boring old git like me.

12:38.279 --> 12:41.279
You're not exactly
on a Zimmer frame.

12:41.399 --> 12:45.319
It's a change to talk to someone
more mature than Brian, Kurt and Simon.

12:45.319 --> 12:47.760
That's not too difficult, though, is it?

12:47.760 --> 12:50.760
(Penny giggles)

12:52.200 --> 12:55.880
(JP) If it bothers you so much,
you take over playground duty.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.080
(Kurt) I will.
(Simon) So will I.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.599
Plain or cheese and onion?

13:00.600 --> 13:05.080
No complicated questions after today.
In fact, no one ask me anything again.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.718
There you go. Decision made for you.

13:07.719 --> 13:10.718
I wanted cheese and onion.

13:10.719 --> 13:13.038
Your favourite pupil from year 7

13:13.039 --> 13:16.189
has asked to see me
in open surgery tomorrow.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.759
- Kayla.
- Why isn't she coming to me?

13:23.760 --> 13:25.559
No idea.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.320
Is there something wrong with me?

13:27.320 --> 13:29.639
You don't want me to answer that.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.478
I can talk about personal stuff.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.559
I can be sympathetic.
I can be approachable.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.798
(All) Whoa!

Well, what's all this in aid of?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.359
Nothing.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.360
You... you look great, Bob. Really.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.398
I'll tell Clare you're covering again.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.039
- Thanks, Liz.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.040
Too late. He's beaten you to it.

15:06.999 --> 15:08.880
You can't do it again tomorrow.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.039
- Why not?
- It's against the rules.

15:11.039 --> 15:14.039
- The ones you've just made up?
- Yes.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.210
Oh, fucking great,
the trampoline's broken!

15:17.360 --> 15:20.510
I told Jeremy not to go on it -
the fat fuck!

15:21.120 --> 15:23.079
Thanks.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.080
Is there something I should know?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.278
No.

15:29.279 --> 15:30.760
(Bell)

15:30.760 --> 15:33.640
I should let you know
I'm helping Penny today.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.640
- With what?
- She knows how busy you are

15:36.760 --> 15:39.600
so I'll help her
catch up on her coursework.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.319
Just for this week.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.199
I would've helped her
if she'd have come to me.

15:44.199 --> 15:47.489
- Are you busy at lunchtime?
- Well, yes but...

15:47.599 --> 15:50.119
Well, there we are. Problem solved.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.839
And I'd be careful what you say
about her behind her back.

15:53.839 --> 15:55.718
I didn't.

15:55.719 --> 15:59.039
I just mentioned to Jenny
she was behind on the coursework.

15:59.039 --> 16:02.399
- What else did she say?
- Nothing. She was just upset.

16:02.399 --> 16:06.799
Her confidence has been knocked
so it's up to us to support her.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.369
Right. Shall we all wear
"Well done, Penny" badges?

16:10.719 --> 16:13.639
If you could take something seriously...

16:13.640 --> 16:16.640
just for once.

16:16.799 --> 16:19.599
For fuck's sake!
Is it "Have a go at Jenny" week?

16:19.599 --> 16:22.039
- Why doesn't he just say it?
- What?

16:22.039 --> 16:25.039
- He thinks I'm crap.
- Yeah. Probably.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.999
Brian!

16:32.000 --> 16:33.480
Brian.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.119
Do you think I could do
with being fitter?

16:36.119 --> 16:39.129
- What about a bit of toning?
- Huh. A bit?

16:39.959 --> 16:42.040
Why do you want to get fit suddenly?

16:42.040 --> 16:44.879
I've been thinking about it for a while.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.880
I just want to feel better, look better.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.519
But you'll still look like...

16:50.520 --> 16:53.278
you.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.959
Look, would you help me
to get in shape?

16:55.959 --> 16:58.360
Maybe you could be
my personal trainer?

16:58.360 --> 17:01.360
- Is this a wind-up?
- No, I'm serious.

17:02.039 --> 17:05.039
All right, then.
You can pay me in beer.

17:06.638 --> 17:09.040
I've been asked
to have a word with you.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.880
Stop pissing about
in Miss Neville's lessons.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.760
- I haven't been.
- Bollocks.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.199
I've checked your marks
and you're only down in English.

17:17.199 --> 17:20.920
I know. I tried to tell you yesterday.
It's not my fault.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.880
- Whose fault is it?
- Miss Neville's. She's shit!

17:23.880 --> 17:27.760
You get stuck on something,
she either gives you a vague answer

17:27.760 --> 17:31.599
or talks about personal stuff
till you forget what you asked.

17:31.599 --> 17:34.520
Or she leans over
and shoves her tits in your face.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.038
(Boing!)

17:36.039 --> 17:39.039
What? She actually... leans right in?

17:40.159 --> 17:42.079
She does it to most of the lads.

17:42.079 --> 17:45.399
At first it was a laugh
but you learn fuck all off her.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.640
Now my parents are on my back about it.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.640
And they're literally in your face?

17:50.999 --> 17:55.409
Look, if I get bad marks this year,
it's because of her, right?

17:56.400 --> 17:59.119
Right.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.838
Er, that's it. See ya.

18:00.839 --> 18:03.799
So what are you going to do about it?

18:03.800 --> 18:05.999
Just leave it with me.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
- Thanks, Miss Paige.
- Bye, Kayla.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.480
Why did Kayla want to see you?

18:15.480 --> 18:19.470
She just wanted to ask me
a couple of personal questions.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.598
Oh, right. I wasn't being nosy,

18:22.599 --> 18:25.959
I just wondered
if it may affect her coursework.

18:26.199 --> 18:28.359
Not really.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.360
Oh, right. Good.

18:39.999 --> 18:42.999
(Panicked breathing)

18:45.120 --> 18:48.120
(Breathes faster)

18:51.240 --> 18:54.118
(Penguins chirping)

18:54.119 --> 18:57.119
(Clare) It must be nice to be wanted.

19:14.959 --> 19:17.959
(Mouths)

19:18.999 --> 19:21.039
(JP) Ask her if it's true.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.838
What am I meant to say?

19:22.839 --> 19:26.640
"Please don't shove your tits
in Ricky's face. It's distracting."

19:26.640 --> 19:28.678
It's straight to the point.

19:28.679 --> 19:30.640
- You could mention it to her.
- Me?

19:30.640 --> 19:33.720
You're gay. She won't mind
you mentioning her tits.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.319
If I do it, she'll think I'm coming onto her.

19:36.319 --> 19:38.438
I'm not doing it.

19:38.439 --> 19:41.439
No!

19:41.999 --> 19:45.319
See you in the staff room
for the five-minute lunch hour.

19:45.319 --> 19:48.329
Can't, I'm doing
circuit training with Bob.

19:50.599 --> 19:53.160
Am I the only one
who finds it disturbing?

19:53.160 --> 19:54.599
(Kurt and Jenny) No.

19:54.599 --> 19:56.600
It's almost - and I mean almost -

19:56.600 --> 19:58.959
enough to make you
feel sorry for Penny.

19:58.959 --> 20:02.319
- Is it?
- Would you want Bob lusting after you?

20:03.120 --> 20:05.318
- Of course.
- Would you?

20:05.319 --> 20:08.639
(Susan) All the classic signs
of a mid-life crisis.

20:08.639 --> 20:12.480
(Kurt) Oh, fuck. He's not going to start
break-dancing, is he?

20:12.480 --> 20:16.400
(Susan) What's so sad is
he probably believes Penny fancies him.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.199
(Kurt) No wonder
he's giving her one-to-ones.

20:19.199 --> 20:23.079
(Jenny) So while I thought
I was fucking up and he was helping her,

20:23.079 --> 20:26.439
he actually only wants
to get into her knickers.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.399
Stupid old twat.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.400
(Panting)

20:34.239 --> 20:37.680
I thought you said
we'd start with a gentle warm-up?

20:37.680 --> 20:39.239
We are.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.919
What?

20:40.920 --> 20:43.920
(Sighs heavily)

20:46.280 --> 20:48.680
- The trick is...
- Shall I open a window?

20:48.680 --> 20:51.038
You look a bit... flushed.

20:51.039 --> 20:53.438
No, I'm fine.

20:53.439 --> 20:56.399
Erm, get them interested in it first.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.640
Find something contentious.
Get a reaction from them.

20:59.640 --> 21:04.199
Right. The thing is, whenever I do that,
they don't seem interested.

21:04.199 --> 21:05.999
What makes you think that?

21:05.999 --> 21:09.709
I don't know, they just have
these bored expressions.

21:10.159 --> 21:13.199
Maybe I'm approaching it badly.
Too rambling.

21:13.199 --> 21:15.079
I'm not as direct as Jenny.

21:15.079 --> 21:18.280
You could say
she always gets straight to the point.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.570
I'm glad you said that.
I was feeling paranoid.

21:21.760 --> 21:26.239
Am I the only person in the school
who finds her a bit intimidating?

21:26.239 --> 21:29.279
She can seem like that
if you don't know her.

21:29.279 --> 21:31.599
- You don't find me intimidating?
- No.

21:31.599 --> 21:35.680
But you're quite good at making people
feel at ease, aren't you?

21:35.680 --> 21:38.680
Am I?

21:38.719 --> 21:40.599
(Bell)

21:40.600 --> 21:44.680
Anyway, erm... the best plan would be
for you to write notes

21:44.680 --> 21:48.439
on how you're going to tackle
your year 11 class tomorrow.

21:48.439 --> 21:52.239
So that's the key elements
of Scout's emotional journey.

21:52.239 --> 21:54.359
We'll go over it in the morning.

21:54.359 --> 21:56.319
Fine. No problem.

21:56.320 --> 21:59.320
Good.

22:01.719 --> 22:04.480
- Can I have a word, Bob?
- Is it important?

22:04.480 --> 22:06.198
I think it is, yes.

22:06.199 --> 22:10.159
I appreciate you trying to help
but I should look after Penny.

22:10.159 --> 22:13.840
- She's my responsibility.
- But you have no time for her.

22:13.840 --> 22:17.079
If Penny feels she's behind,
she should come to me.

22:17.079 --> 22:19.118
She told me she's not behind.

22:19.119 --> 22:21.958
She will say that if you intimidate her.

22:21.959 --> 22:24.959
- She said that?
- It was more... implied.

22:25.160 --> 22:28.400
I mean, you clearly
haven't got time to mentor her

22:28.400 --> 22:30.280
- so I think I should do it.
- Fine.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.280
I'm obviously incapable!

22:35.159 --> 22:39.499
(Jenny) She's a duplicitous,
manipulative, twisted little cow.

22:39.720 --> 22:43.760
Who the hell does she think she is,
saying I'm intimidating?

22:43.760 --> 22:46.760
I have never intimidated her!

22:47.280 --> 22:50.199
For fuck's sake!
Look what she's made me do!

22:50.199 --> 22:53.209
At least you're not
letting her get to you.

22:54.199 --> 22:57.419
Bob's only helping her
because he fancies her.

22:57.439 --> 22:59.718
He'll probably let Clare know

22:59.719 --> 23:02.039
and she'll want to know
why I didn't spot

23:02.039 --> 23:04.559
that Penny was so far behind
in her work,

23:04.559 --> 23:06.479
which won't reflect well on me!

23:06.479 --> 23:10.119
So it's not Penny so much as being
accused of neglecting her

23:10.119 --> 23:14.359
- and appearing unprofessional.
- Good idea if you don't say anything...

23:14.359 --> 23:15.559
- Right.
- ..ever.

23:15.559 --> 23:17.598
I think what you should do...

23:17.599 --> 23:22.009
Can I just point out you're the 25th
person I've advised today?

23:23.040 --> 23:26.479
Put all this in perspective.
You're getting wound up

23:26.479 --> 23:30.479
about someone who thinks having
a boob job is a career advancement.

23:30.479 --> 23:32.959
- In her case it is, though.
- Shut up.

23:32.959 --> 23:35.720
Sooner or later,
she's going to get found out.

23:35.720 --> 23:39.239
Until then, don't let her know
she's getting to you.

23:39.239 --> 23:42.949
In fact, be nice to her.
It'll confuse her, trust me.

23:43.399 --> 23:46.160
- Nice?
- It's when you're polite to someone,

23:46.160 --> 23:49.160
pay them compliments...

23:52.040 --> 23:55.040
(Sighs heavily) OK.

23:55.879 --> 23:58.879
Nice.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.760
I can do nice.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.640
- Go on, then.
- Maybe I'll do it tomorrow.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.680
She's probably
got a lot on her mind...

24:09.680 --> 24:12.318
Go on!

24:12.319 --> 24:14.799
Penny, I wanted a word.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.800
- What about?
- It's about Ricky Sharpe.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.918
Only it's a bit awkward.

24:19.919 --> 24:21.598
Why?

24:21.599 --> 24:23.839
It's just... He came to see me.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.319
Hm.

24:25.319 --> 24:27.760
He thinks there's a couple of things

24:27.760 --> 24:30.719
getting in the way
of his class work in English.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.719
- What things?
- Big... things.

24:36.199 --> 24:37.799
Huge.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.240
You going to tell me what they are?

24:40.240 --> 24:41.479
Yes, I am.

24:41.479 --> 24:44.159
Carol, fancy a drink?

24:44.160 --> 24:45.998
OK.

24:45.999 --> 24:49.520
Er, probably best I tell you
when no one else is around.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.999
See you later.

24:50.999 --> 24:55.689
If I were you, I'd be relieved
you don't go out with Kurt any more.

24:56.319 --> 24:58.439
You don't mind
Bob taking over from me?

24:58.439 --> 25:01.729
No, not really.
Although if I'm being honest...

25:01.999 --> 25:04.558
(Sniggers)

25:04.559 --> 25:07.559
- Wind.
- I'd rather have you.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.800
I mean, Bob's lovely but a bit boring.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.759
He'll say, "What are the key elements
of Scout's emotional journey?"

25:14.759 --> 25:18.159
and you think about something else
until you reach a point

25:18.159 --> 25:20.999
where you've forgotten
what those key elements are

25:20.999 --> 25:22.559
and your notes make no sense.

25:22.559 --> 25:25.559
- Do you know what I mean?
- Not really.

25:25.839 --> 25:29.059
I mean, you've lost
your concentration so much

25:29.079 --> 25:31.158
then he puts you on the spot.

25:31.159 --> 25:35.079
So, say you're me.
He'd go, "What are the key elements?"

25:36.359 --> 25:38.118
You say...

25:38.119 --> 25:41.360
Just say you need a bit more time
to think about it.

25:41.360 --> 25:44.360
Erm... can you... carrying drinks?

25:46.160 --> 25:49.160
- Sure.
- Thanks.

25:51.079 --> 25:54.480
Does anyone have a clue
what she was talking about?

25:54.480 --> 25:56.039
No idea.

25:56.040 --> 25:58.719
Bob's asked her to do something,
she can't do it,

25:58.719 --> 26:01.719
so she's trying to get us
to give her the answers.

26:01.719 --> 26:03.279
Of course, it's obvious.

26:03.279 --> 26:06.279
Is that why Jenny had to tell you?

26:08.319 --> 26:11.640
- Where have you been?
- Doing circuits with Bob.

26:11.640 --> 26:15.520
Do you lose your concentration
when Bob's talking to you?

26:15.520 --> 26:17.480
No, just the will to live. Why?

26:17.480 --> 26:19.518
It must just be me, then.

26:19.519 --> 26:22.439
So, did you lose
your concentration so much

26:22.439 --> 26:24.119
you couldn't answer it?

26:24.120 --> 26:26.358
No, I did give him an answer.

26:26.359 --> 26:30.680
I'm just not sure I gave enough emphasis
to some of the elements.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.999
Which would you say were important?

26:32.999 --> 26:35.919
Probably the same as you.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.718
How about you, Jenny?

26:37.719 --> 26:42.519
Some elements are more key than
others. But it's down to interpretation.

26:42.519 --> 26:45.999
I mean, all interpretation
is ultimately subjective.

26:45.999 --> 26:48.999
- True.
- I'm sure you got it right.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.758
I'd better go.

26:54.759 --> 26:57.879
I've got some things to do.
One of you can have this.

26:57.879 --> 27:00.839
- See you tomorrow.
- (Simon and Jenny) Bye.

27:00.839 --> 27:03.839
- What happened to being nice?
- We were being nice.

27:03.839 --> 27:06.400
- By not helping her?
- But we did it in a nice way.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.638
Did you tell her?

27:08.639 --> 27:10.640
- Kind of.
- You didn't, did you?

27:10.640 --> 27:13.640
- No.
- No.

27:13.680 --> 27:17.390
Penny's been shoving her tits
in Ricky Sharpe's face.

27:17.839 --> 27:20.438
Makes a change from Bob's face.

27:20.439 --> 27:24.040
If one of us did what she's doing,
it'd be sexual harassment.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.879
We haven't got tits.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.758
Bob has.

27:27.759 --> 27:30.979
I wonder if I'll have tits
when I'm Bob's age?

27:36.400 --> 27:38.759
Did you ever make sense of your notes?

27:38.759 --> 27:41.759
- Yes, I think so.
- Good.

27:41.999 --> 27:43.319
What the...

27:43.319 --> 27:45.638
Morning!

27:45.639 --> 27:47.920
Fucking hell.
It's Judith Chalmers.

you know where I am.

28:05.119 --> 28:08.038
OK, bye.

28:08.039 --> 28:09.719
Is everything OK, Kayla?

28:10.079 --> 28:11.718
Yes, thanks.

28:11.719 --> 28:14.869
You know, my door's always open...
to anyone.

28:15.079 --> 28:18.079
Hm, it's shut, actually.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.960
You know what I mean.

28:25.439 --> 28:29.719
- Did you give Penny work last night?
- Is that any of your business?

28:29.719 --> 28:33.079
No, it's just she seemed
unsure about her notes.

28:33.280 --> 28:36.999
- If so, she can ask me.
- We were just concerned about her.

28:36.999 --> 28:39.520
- Did you give her some work?
- Yes...

28:39.520 --> 28:42.160
- Did she do it?
- She's finishing it off.

28:42.160 --> 28:45.599
So she might still be
finishing it off next week then?

28:45.599 --> 28:49.379
What's with this back-biting?
You, Penny. Penny, Jenny.

28:49.560 --> 28:53.199
- Let's nip this in the bud.
- I'm not doing a group hug.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.679
You two and Penny, my office, 1 pm.

28:55.680 --> 28:59.460
- What about open surgery?
- Bollocks to open surgery.

29:59.600 --> 30:03.030
I want to make it clear
that I won't tolerate it!

30:04.639 --> 30:09.280
You're meant to offer support to NQTs,
not destroy their confidence.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.079
I want this sorted out now.

I think you rely on other people

30:14.239 --> 30:16.718
- I'm doing my best.
- Are you?

30:16.719 --> 30:19.839
If that's how you feel,
I'd rather know the truth.

30:19.839 --> 30:23.000
If other people think the same,
I'd sooner know.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
I could ask around.

30:26.439 --> 30:29.839
Jenny, is there anything
you'd like to say to Penny?

30:29.839 --> 30:32.640
I wish you'd come to me
instead of going to Bob

30:32.640 --> 30:35.158
and telling him I'm intimidating.

30:35.159 --> 30:38.199
I think I've been
the exact opposite with you.

30:38.199 --> 30:40.959
Maybe it's just your manner...
or something.

30:40.959 --> 30:42.439
Is that it?

30:42.439 --> 30:44.278
Not quite.

30:44.279 --> 30:48.280
I also want to say I've set aside
as much time as I could for you.

30:48.280 --> 30:52.920
I know and I appreciate that.
I also appreciate that your time is limited.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.800
I'm not trying to blame you.

30:54.800 --> 30:58.230
I know you like to rush home
to Alec every night.

30:58.480 --> 31:02.280
- What are you trying to imply?
- I'm not implying anything.

31:02.280 --> 31:05.479
- Then why bring Alec into this?
- You're overreacting.

31:05.479 --> 31:09.239
You only mentioned it
to suggest I put my personal life

31:09.239 --> 31:11.039
- before my work life.
- No.

31:11.039 --> 31:14.920
Bollocks! You've just tried to shift
the focus from you to me.

31:14.920 --> 31:18.160
This is about your teaching
inadequacies, not mine.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.560
- Don't snap at her.
- (Jenny) I wasn't!

31:20.560 --> 31:23.570
Why does everybody
misinterpret what I say?

31:23.879 --> 31:25.800
I'm just trying to be a good teacher.

31:25.800 --> 31:30.159
Maybe you can't handle the job.
I wasn't saying you definitely can't.

31:30.159 --> 31:33.589
For fuck's sake,
you're making it worse. Shut up.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.038
Oh, jeez!

31:36.039 --> 31:39.039
- Bob?
- Ow!

Oh, fuck!

31:42.319 --> 31:45.319
Oh, fuck, I think it's his heart!

31:45.759 --> 31:48.759
It's OK! Everything's under control.

31:58.680 --> 32:01.680
I'll go with him to the hospital.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.438
Poor Bob.

32:08.439 --> 32:10.039
Fuck.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.718
Sorry.

32:11.719 --> 32:14.399
What exactly happened?

32:14.400 --> 32:16.559
We were doing... role-play,

32:16.560 --> 32:20.040
trying to see things from
Penny's perspective as an NQT

32:20.040 --> 32:24.940
and Penny was trying to see things
from the perspective of the mentor.

32:24.959 --> 32:28.249
- Why was she crying?
- She gets very involved.

32:31.680 --> 32:35.600
Until we hear from the hospital,
let's play this down a little.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.600
It'll only cause disruption.

32:48.359 --> 32:50.118
Poor old Bob.

32:50.119 --> 32:52.319
I'll miss him having a go at me.

32:52.319 --> 32:55.319
I'll miss his... little orange face.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.560
Murderer.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.479
What? Don't blame me.

33:03.480 --> 33:07.480
- You pushed him too hard.
- It's not my fault he overdid it.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.878
If anyone's to blame, it's them.

33:09.879 --> 33:11.999
We didn't know
he'd have a heart attack.

33:11.999 --> 33:15.959
Maybe his jeans were too tight
and caused a build-up of pressure.

33:15.959 --> 33:18.959
What a shame.
Died dressed like a twat.

33:20.199 --> 33:23.199

33:25.279 --> 33:26.838
Hello?

33:26.839 --> 33:29.639
Penny.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.640
What?

33:33.160 --> 33:35.758
He's sitting up in bed.

33:35.759 --> 33:38.518
- Indigestion.
- The stupid bastard.

33:38.519 --> 33:41.680
Fucking ponce!
I told him not to eat after exercising!

33:41.680 --> 33:44.039
Thanks, Penny. Bye.

33:44.040 --> 33:46.640
- Some good should come of this.
- Like what?

33:46.640 --> 33:49.240
- The end of his mid-life crisis.
- How?

33:49.240 --> 33:54.070

maybe he'll start acting his age again.

on a day trip to Chernobyl?

Bob's OK.

34:55.399 --> 34:57.279

34:57.280 --> 34:59.678
just... go to the loo.

35:21.279 --> 35:25.549
Yeah, but he's still fragile
so I said I'd help at lunchtime.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.120
(Penny) How are you, Bob?
(Bob) Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

35:38.120 --> 35:39.559
Never better.

35:39.559 --> 35:42.559
Have you finished
writing up your notes?

35:42.600 --> 35:45.600
Nearly. I would've done them yesterday,

35:46.159 --> 35:49.869
only what with being
all that time at the hospital...

35:49.959 --> 35:51.998
Yeah. Er... end of the day?

35:51.999 --> 35:54.559
No problem. Thanks, Bob.

35:54.560 --> 35:57.520
- So much for your theory.
- We've got to tell him.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.199
You're right. Off you go.

35:59.199 --> 36:01.720
- Why should it be me?
- It was your idea.

36:01.720 --> 36:05.080
- But he might be really hurt.
- Yeah, it's too cruel.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.440
Someone's got to say something
to stop him going more orange.

36:08.440 --> 36:11.840
- You're his personal trainer.
- I'm not doing it!

36:11.840 --> 36:13.878
He might chin me.

36:13.879 --> 36:17.040
You do it, JP.
Bob wouldn't hit you, you're gay.

36:17.040 --> 36:20.760
Why do you assume I can sort things out
just because I'm gay?

36:20.760 --> 36:22.959
- Does that mean you'll do it?
- No.

36:22.959 --> 36:25.838
Abso-fucking-lutely not.

36:25.839 --> 36:27.878
(Sighs heavily)

36:27.879 --> 36:30.879
Only one thing for it, then.

(Simon) Oh, yes, baby.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.160
(Susan) Oh, phew.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.359
(All) Oh!
(Brian) Bastard!

36:43.360 --> 36:46.360
- You fixed that!
- Bollocks I did!

(Simon) Did you?
(Kurt) Course I did!

36:49.280 --> 36:50.719

- You can be a bit late.
- Not really.

Clare might be on the warpath.

37:24.960 --> 37:27.960
All right, we'll jog on the way in.

37:33.399 --> 37:36.399

37:36.959 --> 37:39.959
Bob...

37:40.520 --> 37:43.360
Look, I'm not very good
at this sort of thing.

37:43.360 --> 37:46.790
I don't know how to say this
without hurting you.

37:47.879 --> 37:51.440
But you're making a complete twat
of yourself, mate.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.119
What do you mean?

37:53.120 --> 37:55.120
All this getting fit and stuff.

37:55.120 --> 38:00.020
Just cos I'm a bit older, it doesn't mean
I can't get myself in shape.

38:00.159 --> 38:03.679
- No, I wasn't saying that.
- What were you saying, then?

38:03.679 --> 38:08.019
(Sighs) Well, it's just more to do
with why you're doing this.

38:09.719 --> 38:12.079
Well, I'm not with you.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.239
Well... say, for instance,
you were doing this

38:15.239 --> 38:17.398
because you fancied someone.

38:17.399 --> 38:20.399
Like who?

38:20.439 --> 38:22.398
I dunno. Anyone.

38:22.399 --> 38:25.399
Maybe someone a bit younger.

38:26.399 --> 38:29.559
Maybe more than a bit younger,
quite a lot younger.

38:29.559 --> 38:33.619
Why should I fancy anyone else?
I'm a happily married man.

38:33.959 --> 38:36.720
Well, maybe not so much
you fancying them.

38:36.720 --> 38:40.920
It could be you thinking
they might fancy you, for instance.

38:42.519 --> 38:45.879
Yeah, well, I shouldn't think
anyone fancies me.

38:45.880 --> 38:49.100
Yeah, well, you know
what some women are like.

38:50.240 --> 38:55.420
They make you think they fancy you
so you let them get away with... stuff.

38:56.119 --> 38:59.689
But... you know,
they actually think you're boring.

39:02.319 --> 39:05.539
In fact, they might say that
behind your back.

39:09.199 --> 39:12.199
Well, I've had worse things
said about me.

39:13.999 --> 39:17.359
Anyway, it's not like
it's ever going to happen.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.359
There you go, then.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.638
It's nothing to worry about.

39:21.639 --> 39:24.080
Yeah, I'm feeling a bit of a twinge.

39:24.080 --> 39:28.070
Yeah, perhaps I should take it easy
for a few days, yeah?

39:30.480 --> 39:32.999
(Female teacher) Any time.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.599
- Any time.
- OK. Bye-bye.

Have you?

40:52.480 --> 40:55.759
Well, it's obvious
that you're more than capable

40:55.759 --> 40:57.759
of being Penny's mentor.

40:57.760 --> 41:00.760
Thanks, Bob.

41:01.679 --> 41:05.880
Having said that, I still think
it's best if I keep helping her.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.599
It's not that I'm implying
that older is necessarily wiser

41:09.599 --> 41:11.799
because sometimes it isn't.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.800
In fact, older can sometimes mean...

41:17.360 --> 41:20.279
foolish...

41:20.280 --> 41:23.238
stupid, even.

41:23.239 --> 41:25.279
It's just that, er...

41:25.280 --> 41:29.480
a more senior figure is expected
to exert more... authority,

41:31.240 --> 41:34.240
more discipline.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.919
At least, that's the theory.

41:36.920 --> 41:40.070
It's not always easy
to put it into practice.

41:40.279 --> 41:43.279
It's sometimes easy to...

41:44.399 --> 41:47.399
be distracted and make a mistake.

41:50.760 --> 41:52.799
Still, erm...

41:52.800 --> 41:55.800
there's always time to make amends.

41:56.720 --> 42:00.279
I'm sure Penny will appreciate
what you're doing for her.

42:00.279 --> 42:03.279
And so do I.

Why do you think
Kayla's been avoiding me?

42:15.800 --> 42:19.880
Oh, it is just a hunch but maybe
she doesn't want to ask advice

42:19.880 --> 42:23.870
from someone who's convinced
she's the daughter of Satan.

42:24.880 --> 42:29.500
So if she was in trouble, serious trouble,
she'd never come to me.

42:33.839 --> 42:36.839
Look, don't worry. It's fine.

42:41.079 --> 42:42.520
Penny.

42:42.520 --> 42:46.580
Er, departmental meeting,
my office, 9am tomorrow morning.

42:47.720 --> 42:51.800
Er, I want the forecast grades in
for year 11 without excuses.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.398
I've drawn up a timetable for you

42:54.399 --> 42:56.880
so you know
when you can come and see me.

42:56.880 --> 42:59.120
And don't worry, if you fall behind,

42:59.120 --> 43:02.120
I've set some assignments
to help you.

43:07.319 --> 43:10.319
(Bell)

43:11.880 --> 43:14.880
Er, Kayla.

43:15.120 --> 43:18.120
Er... if something was wrong,

43:19.079 --> 43:21.880
do you think
I'm someone you could come to?

43:21.880 --> 43:25.839
- It depends what's wrong.
- Say it was something serious.

43:25.839 --> 43:27.879
What I'm trying to say is,

43:27.880 --> 43:30.679
why have you seen
every other member of staff

43:30.679 --> 43:32.519
for open surgery except me?

43:32.519 --> 43:35.560
I haven't seen everyone.
It's just your paranoia.

43:35.560 --> 43:38.319
Well, quite a few
other members of staff.

43:38.319 --> 43:40.840
Maybe I'd feel awkward talking to you.

43:40.840 --> 43:43.840
But you can talk to me about anything.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.918
- Anything?
- Absolutely.

43:45.919 --> 43:48.919
OK, then.

43:49.479 --> 43:52.880
I wasn't sure whether to use
sanitary towels or tampons

43:52.880 --> 43:55.199
cos I only started my periods this week.

43:55.199 --> 43:59.469
Then I wasn't sure whether
to get the winged sanitary towels.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
Winged.

44:06.240 --> 44:08.718
So... why didn't you ask your mum?

44:08.719 --> 44:11.719
Would you ask her if you were me?

44:11.839 --> 44:13.359
Fair point.

44:13.360 --> 44:17.910
Someone said if you've got a heavy flow
you could go on the pill.

44:18.119 --> 44:21.269
But I think I'm too young.
What do you think?

44:24.199 --> 44:26.959
Erm...

44:26.960 --> 44:29.960
Do you need a new atlas?

44:30.719 --> 44:34.199
(Susan) Do you think Carol's
got a Penny shrine in her bedroom?

44:34.199 --> 44:38.049
Probably filled with the photocopies
Penny made her do.

44:38.079 --> 44:40.919
I can't believe
he gave her so much stuff to do.

44:40.919 --> 44:42.639
Even you wouldn't be that cruel.

44:42.639 --> 44:46.419
No, mainly because I'd have
to spend hours checking it

44:46.480 --> 44:48.398
and Alec's back tomorrow.

44:48.399 --> 44:50.958
- (Simon) Oh, fuck!
- What?

44:50.959 --> 44:53.969
I think I'm starting to feel sorry for her.

44:54.759 --> 44:56.958
Oh, no, it's OK. It's gone now.

44:56.959 --> 44:58.399
(Thunder)

44:58.399 --> 45:00.399
- Are you going to the pub?
- Yeah.

45:00.399 --> 45:03.318
No, we can't.
We're doing something else.

45:03.319 --> 45:06.319
Right.

45:06.360 --> 45:07.959
What was all that about?

45:07.959 --> 45:11.680
She can't come to the pub if Bob's there.
It might upset him.

45:11.680 --> 45:14.999
- Bob's coming to the pub?
- Yeah, I've asked him.

45:14.999 --> 45:16.838
Why? We never ask him.

45:16.839 --> 45:19.839
I know but I feel sorry for him.

45:20.120 --> 45:23.120
Poof.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.478
He's asked Bob to the pub.

45:26.479 --> 45:28.198
- Bob!
- Nice gesture.

45:28.199 --> 45:31.279
- I thought so.
- Sorry, what I meant was...

45:31.440 --> 45:33.839
- Ow!
- You fucking prick!

45:33.840 --> 45:37.720
Poor Bob, though. She's made him look
like a complete pillock.

45:37.720 --> 45:39.840
Maybe we should make an effort.

45:39.840 --> 45:42.839
Wear your Wonderbra tomorrow.
That'd cheer him up.

45:42.839 --> 45:46.689
Two-faced cow. I'm not talking to her
unless I have to.

45:46.880 --> 45:49.680
- Yeah, me too.
- You don't talk to her anyway,

45:49.680 --> 45:52.680
- you just stare at her tits.
- Oh, yeah.

45:52.919 --> 45:57.119
OK, from now on, I won't stare at her tits
unless I have to.

45:57.360 --> 45:59.478
Or... unless it's accidental.

45:59.479 --> 46:02.559
Or unless she's wearing
a really low-cut top.

46:02.559 --> 46:05.360
You know the pink one
she wears sometimes.
