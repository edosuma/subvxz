Ha-har!

01:03.430 --> 01:04.963
Ahoy, mateys!

01:04.965 --> 01:07.766
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:09.069 --> 01:10.102
Great!

01:10.104 --> 01:11.770
To start today's adventure,

01:11.772 --> 01:14.540
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.208
Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.210 --> 01:18.210
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:18.212 --> 01:19.745
One more time.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.814
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:25.218 --> 01:28.620
<i>[Jake] F-f-frozen Never Land!</i>

01:28.622 --> 01:31.423
<i>[Cubby] We've been hit</i>
<i>by a buccaneer blizzard!</i>

01:31.425 --> 01:35.894
I'm gonna wave
my arms and legs and
make a pirate snow angel!

01:35.896 --> 01:38.097
I'm going to build
a snow castle!

01:38.099 --> 01:40.499
[sneezes]

01:40.501 --> 01:43.802
Sorry, mateys,
no can play.

01:43.804 --> 01:47.506
I caught the
Never Land Birdie Flu!

01:47.508 --> 01:52.544
Awww. You need warm liquids,
like birdseed broth!

01:52.546 --> 01:55.380
And a nice thick
feather blanket.

01:55.382 --> 01:58.650
Brr. Even those won't
keep Skully warm today!

01:58.652 --> 02:00.419
It's f-f-freezing!

02:00.421 --> 02:04.022
[shivering] Yeah!
Can we crank up the heat?

02:04.024 --> 02:07.659
If only we had
Fire Red Rubies.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.429
Those gems are really
hot, hot, hot!

02:10.431 --> 02:12.631
Mateys, check this out.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.700
We can find
those rubies here,

02:14.702 --> 02:16.935
in Fire Red Ruby Valley!

02:16.937 --> 02:19.571
Cool! I mean, hot.

02:19.573 --> 02:23.909
Mateys, let's find
the Fire Red Rubies so
we can warm up Skully!

02:23.911 --> 02:26.111
- Yo-ho, let's...
- [knocking]

02:26.113 --> 02:28.747
- Who could that be?
- [knocking]

02:30.283 --> 02:31.617
Cold enough for ya?

02:31.619 --> 02:34.586
- [all] Percy!
- In the feathers!

02:34.588 --> 02:36.688
When I saw this blizzard,
I thought, Percy,

02:36.690 --> 02:39.625
it's a perfect time
to visit your pals
on Pirate Island.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.527
But we were just
heading to Never Land

02:41.529 --> 02:44.163
to find Fire Red Rubies
to warm up Skully.

02:44.165 --> 02:46.298
He got the
Never Land Birdie Flu!

02:46.300 --> 02:48.233
Oh, poor parrot!

02:48.235 --> 02:50.435
Why, who better
to help you cross
frozen Never Land

02:50.437 --> 02:52.604
to aid a
feathered-friend
than a penguin?

02:52.606 --> 02:55.674
Awesome, Percy!
We'll be right out!

02:56.943 --> 03:00.078
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

03:00.080 --> 03:02.548
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

03:02.550 --> 03:03.949
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

03:03.951 --> 03:07.486
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

03:07.488 --> 03:10.489
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

03:10.491 --> 03:12.891
<i>¶ And me </i>

03:12.893 --> 03:15.727
Ahh, love that
cool breeze.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.896
A stiff wind
flutterin' me feathers!

03:17.898 --> 03:19.731
Arctic air soothin' me...

03:19.733 --> 03:23.068
Oh hang on, hey mates,
pirate-y ship ahead!

03:23.070 --> 03:25.971
- It's the Jolly Roger...
- [clanging]

03:25.973 --> 03:29.474
Ahoy, Captain Hook!
Need any help?

03:29.476 --> 03:34.980
No! Captain Hook needs
nothing from no one!

03:34.982 --> 03:37.182
Well, just let us know.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.885
We're off to find
some Fire Red Rubies.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.755
In Fire Red Ruby Valley.
See ya!

03:43.757 --> 03:48.293
Cap'n, are you sure
we shouldn't have
asked them for help?

03:48.295 --> 03:53.365
Oh. Our dear old ship
is frozen solid in
the icy Never Sea!

03:53.367 --> 03:55.867
I know!
We could melt the ice

03:55.869 --> 04:00.272
if we had them famous
F-f-fire Red Rubies
Jake told us about.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.840
I've got it!

04:01.842 --> 04:06.745
We are going in search
of the legendary
Fire Red Rubies!

04:06.747 --> 04:09.448
It's like he can
read me mind.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.185
- [Jake] Yeah!
- [Izzy] Yippee!

04:13.187 --> 04:14.953
- Woo-hoo!
- [giggling]

04:14.955 --> 04:17.889
Oh, it's a
Never Land Snow Day.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.992
Too bad we don't
have time to play!

04:19.994 --> 04:22.327
Well, you know what?
Getting to Fire Red Ruby Valley

04:22.329 --> 04:24.796
just might prove to be fun!
Which way, Cubby?

04:24.798 --> 04:28.200
We should head up
Frosted Trail,
straight ahead!

04:28.202 --> 04:33.505
Faster, men! I want those
blasted Fire Red Rubies!

04:33.507 --> 04:36.008
Every last one!

04:36.010 --> 04:38.577
Aw, coconuts!
There's no way Hook

04:38.579 --> 04:42.080
will leave any
Fire Red Rubies for us
to keep Skully warm!

04:42.082 --> 04:45.851
Well then, mateys,
it's a race for the
rubies! Let's move!

04:48.087 --> 04:51.123
Frosted Trail crosses
this big empty field,

04:51.125 --> 04:53.525
but today...
it's not very empty.

04:53.527 --> 04:56.228
It's all giant snow drifts!

04:56.230 --> 04:59.231
It'll take hours
to get across this!

04:59.233 --> 05:02.634
But only minutes
if I pull off the
ol' Penguin Hole-Punch!

05:02.636 --> 05:04.336
The who-what-when-where?

05:04.338 --> 05:07.139
Stand back as
I demonstrate.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.573
Right.
Somebody say "go."

05:08.575 --> 05:10.342
[all] Go!

05:11.444 --> 05:12.711
Pow!

05:12.713 --> 05:14.746
Pow! Pow!

05:14.748 --> 05:16.581
- Awesome!
- Cool.

05:17.950 --> 05:21.019
Oh, come along!
I've made a nice
tunnel for ya!

05:21.021 --> 05:24.156
[all] Yo-ho, let's Snow-Go!

05:24.158 --> 05:27.793
[all whooping, laughing]

05:27.795 --> 05:31.029
We did it!
We got through
the snowdrifts,

05:31.031 --> 05:33.432
And we got three
gold doubloons!

05:33.434 --> 05:35.267
Let's grab 'em and go!

05:38.071 --> 05:41.940
We made it!
That's Fire Red
Ruby Valley!

05:41.942 --> 05:43.909
[Hook] Keep your
eyes open, men.

05:43.911 --> 05:47.145
Ugh. Captain Hook made it too!

05:47.147 --> 05:50.582
I want to find those
Fire Red Rubies!

05:50.584 --> 05:52.417
[men yelling]

05:52.419 --> 05:54.319
[shouting]

05:55.188 --> 05:57.055
That buys us
a little time!

05:57.057 --> 05:59.891
But how do we find
the Fire Red Rubies?

05:59.893 --> 06:02.894
Mateys! Look!
That red glow!

06:02.896 --> 06:05.063
I bet there's
something hot
in that pit!

06:05.065 --> 06:07.466
[all] The Fire Red Rubies!

06:07.468 --> 06:09.801
[echoing] The Fire Red Rubies!

06:09.803 --> 06:12.838
[gasps] The Fire Red Rubies!

06:12.840 --> 06:14.606
Move it, men!

06:14.608 --> 06:16.441
[grunting, gasping]

06:16.443 --> 06:19.578
Now's our chance,
before Hook gets
there and takes 'em!

06:19.580 --> 06:21.880
But how do we
get down fast?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.049
[Izzy] If only we had sleds.

06:24.051 --> 06:28.587
Who needs a sled?
I'm going to sled
penguin-style.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.089
[grunts] Follow me!

06:31.091 --> 06:33.725
- C'mon, mates!
- Yeah!

06:33.727 --> 06:36.561
- [Izzy whoops]
- [Cubby] Awesome! Yeah!

06:36.563 --> 06:41.099
<i>¶ With penguin-style</i>
<i>I'm sleddin' stylin' ¶</i>

06:41.101 --> 06:44.302
<i>¶ Whooshing, strooshing</i>
<i>through the snow! ¶</i>

06:44.304 --> 06:48.407
<i>¶ I'm belly surfing</i>
<i>on my tummy, gliding ¶</i>

06:48.409 --> 06:51.209
<i>¶ Everybody look out below! </i>

06:51.211 --> 06:53.578
<i>¶ Oh no there's</i>
<i>no toboggan needed ¶</i>

06:53.580 --> 06:55.514
<i>¶ You're slippery</i>
<i>when seated ¶</i>

06:55.516 --> 06:58.650
<i>¶ Just make sure that</i>
<i>you're pointed downhill ¶</i>

06:58.652 --> 07:00.819
<i>¶ And then penguin</i>
<i>or pirate ¶</i>

07:00.821 --> 07:02.687
<i>¶ You're slippin'</i>
<i>and slidin' ¶</i>

07:02.689 --> 07:06.057
Woo-hoo!
What a wonderful thrill!

07:06.059 --> 07:08.093
<i>¶ Yes, we're</i>
<i>penguin pirate sliding ¶</i>

07:08.095 --> 07:10.028
<i>¶ A snowy race and riding </i>

07:10.030 --> 07:13.131
<i>¶ And you know</i>
<i>it's all downhill ¶</i>

07:13.133 --> 07:15.133
[cheering]

07:15.135 --> 07:16.468
- Yay-hey!
- Yeah!

07:16.470 --> 07:18.637
We slid to the pit
before Captain Hook!

07:18.639 --> 07:21.373
And got two more
gold doubloons!

07:21.375 --> 07:25.076
Let's grab 'em
and go get those
Fire Red Rubies!

07:26.379 --> 07:29.915
- Freeze, popinjays!
- [all] Captain Hook!

07:29.917 --> 07:34.352
That is I!
And I claim these
rubies as me own.

07:34.354 --> 07:38.056
But, Captain Hook,
we need those rubies
for a good cause.

07:38.058 --> 07:42.961
I need them for
a better cause,
my own! Men!

07:42.963 --> 07:45.330
Grab those rubies!

07:45.332 --> 07:47.632
But Captain Hook,
you don't understand!

07:47.634 --> 07:51.403
- Ooh! Hot! Hot!
- Aah! Ow!

07:51.405 --> 07:54.005
They're too hot
to handle, cap'n.

07:54.007 --> 07:57.576
We'll never get them
to the Jolly Roger to
free it from the ice!

07:57.578 --> 08:00.078
Is that why you need
the Fire Red Rubies?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.980
To help free
the Jolly Roger?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.282
We'd be glad to
share the rubies!

08:04.284 --> 08:06.685
First we can use them
to melt your ship free,

08:06.687 --> 08:09.120
then take them back
to warm up Skully.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.456
He's got the
Never Land Birdie Flu.

08:11.458 --> 08:14.960
But the blasted rubies
are too hot to touch.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.063
How will we ever
get them to me ship?

08:18.065 --> 08:20.065
This sounds like an emergency!

08:20.067 --> 08:25.270
You said it, Jake!
Pixie dust... away!

08:25.272 --> 08:27.506
Hang on! I'm flying!

08:27.508 --> 08:30.275
Wha... I'm the very
first flying penguin!

08:30.277 --> 08:35.180
All right, puny pirates,
so the rubies are floating,

08:35.182 --> 08:38.750
but you still can't
touch them to get
them to me ship!

08:38.752 --> 08:42.721
Oh, yeah?
Time for a little
batting practice!

08:42.723 --> 08:44.523
[all] Yeah!

08:46.893 --> 08:49.761
Come on, mateys!
Let's keep 'em goin'.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.497
All the way to
the Jolly Roger!

09:04.844 --> 09:07.512
[Hook] The puny pests did it!

09:07.514 --> 09:13.218
I suppose some sort of
thank you is in order.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.554
[men] Thank you, sea pups!

09:15.556 --> 09:17.556
You're all welcome.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.058
But... now we have
another problem!

09:20.060 --> 09:24.029
The Fire Red Rubies!
They're... sunk.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.830
And so are we!

09:25.832 --> 09:30.302
We can't dive into
that icy water to
get 'em or we'll freeze.

09:30.304 --> 09:33.538
[trumpeting]
Never fear, penguin here!

09:33.540 --> 09:35.941
Just one more thing
we penguins are
born to do...

09:35.943 --> 09:38.176
dive into frigid waters!

09:45.785 --> 09:50.922
[chuckles] Two Fire
Red Rubies... to go!

09:50.924 --> 09:54.326
[all] Hooray, Percy!

09:54.328 --> 09:56.394
We've freed Captain Hook's
vessel from the ice

09:56.396 --> 09:59.631
and saved the Fire Red
Rubies, penguin-style!

09:59.633 --> 10:02.434
And we got four more
gold doubloons!

10:02.436 --> 10:05.537
Let's grab 'em and
go warm up Skully!

10:08.341 --> 10:11.843
Cracklin' hot crackers!
I feel better already!

10:11.845 --> 10:13.845
[Percy]
Glad to hear it, Skully.

10:13.847 --> 10:17.816
I never like to see
a fine flyin' matey
grounded by the birdie flu!

10:17.818 --> 10:22.320
Thanks! Uh...
don't you wanna come over
and warm your toes?

10:22.322 --> 10:25.457
Oh, no thank you, Skully!
Gotta be careful ya see!

10:25.459 --> 10:28.560
Those rubies will melt me
snow-cone lickety-split!

10:29.762 --> 10:32.797
Mm... Cold and frosty!

10:34.600 --> 10:36.835
Mateys, thanks for
helping us find the

10:36.837 --> 10:39.838
Fire Red Rubies to
keep Skully warm!

10:39.840 --> 10:42.140
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

10:42.142 --> 10:44.209
into our Team Treasure Chest.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.718
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

10:53.720 --> 10:55.720
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

10:55.722 --> 10:57.822
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

10:57.824 --> 11:00.725
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

11:00.727 --> 11:03.228
Come on. Count with us.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.764
[all] Yeah!

11:05.766 --> 11:09.434
[Cubby] One, two, three...

11:09.436 --> 11:11.036
[Izzy]
Four, five...

11:11.038 --> 11:14.472
[Jake] Six, seven,
eight, nine.

11:14.474 --> 11:17.742
Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today

11:17.744 --> 11:21.179
we got nine gold doubloons!

11:21.181 --> 11:24.015
And one nice warm hideout!

11:24.017 --> 11:27.018
Thanks to these
Fire Red Rubies!

11:27.020 --> 11:29.421
And me, Percy!

11:31.190 --> 11:34.659
[Hook] At last!
Me ship is free of the ice

11:34.661 --> 11:40.465
and I can now sail off
to plunder and pilfer
as I so love to do!

11:40.467 --> 11:43.301
[the men sneeze]

11:43.303 --> 11:46.438
[groaning]
Sorry, cap'n.

11:46.440 --> 11:51.643
I'm afraid we've all caught
ourselves one terrible cold.

11:51.645 --> 11:55.046
[shivering] Could you
heat us up some nice

11:55.048 --> 11:58.249
hot birdseed broth, sir?

11:58.251 --> 12:02.353
I'm not your
nursemaid, you...

12:02.355 --> 12:05.190
[sneezes]

12:05.192 --> 12:10.061
[moaning]
Fie and flotsam!

12:10.063 --> 12:13.631
[sneezes]

12:16.869 --> 12:19.671
<i>[Jake] Little Stinkers!</i>

12:19.673 --> 12:22.674
[Hook sniffs]
Something stinks.

12:22.676 --> 12:25.777
- [sniffing]
- Beggin' your pardon, cap'n.

12:25.779 --> 12:29.047
Is it time for me
weekly washin'?

12:29.049 --> 12:34.419
Bah! It is not
the odor o' piratey pits
offending me senses.

12:34.421 --> 12:39.190
This stench is worse.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.195
[gasps]
Blustering barnacles!

12:44.197 --> 12:46.998
What have you been
eatin', Bones?!

12:47.000 --> 12:51.302
Your breath smells
like rotten oysters
at low tide!

12:51.304 --> 12:54.839
[chuckles] Oh,
it's not me breath
your smellin', cap'n.

12:54.841 --> 12:58.476
It's me new little addition
to the crew, Stinkette!

12:59.478 --> 13:02.881
[all gasp]

13:02.883 --> 13:05.183
Cute little Skunk Bug, eh?

13:05.185 --> 13:08.253
I found her floating on a
piece of driftin' driftwood.

13:08.255 --> 13:11.256
Oh, and don't worry,
you'll get used to
the smell.

13:11.258 --> 13:14.092
I most certainly will not!

13:14.094 --> 13:18.229
Get that malodorous
buggy bug off me ship!

13:18.231 --> 13:21.499
Aw, but Cap'n,
Stinkette's me pet!

13:21.501 --> 13:26.805
I even made up a little
song for her inspired
by the sounds of nature.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.940
[up-tempo music plays]

13:31.110 --> 13:33.511
[hoots]
Lookee that, cap'n?

13:33.513 --> 13:37.549
The darlin' thing is dancin'!

13:37.551 --> 13:39.884
<i>¶ Stick around Skunk Bug </i>

13:39.886 --> 13:42.153
<i>¶ Stick around Skunk Bug... </i>

13:42.155 --> 13:44.022
That's quite enough!

13:45.157 --> 13:48.526
I don't care
how cute you
think it is.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.095
Put that bug
back to sea!

13:51.097 --> 13:54.265
Oh... Aye aye, cap'n,

13:54.267 --> 13:57.735
but can we at least
set her free on the
nearest island?

13:57.737 --> 13:59.604
Absolutely not.

13:59.606 --> 14:04.075
'Tis a shame...
what with Pirate Island
bein' right over there.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.810
Pirate I...?

14:05.812 --> 14:10.648
I mean "Absolutely
not a bad idea"!

14:10.650 --> 14:14.052
[chuckles] We'll let
the puny pirates deal

14:14.054 --> 14:16.821
with this little
stinker. [giggles]

14:16.823 --> 14:19.624
Good bye, Stinkette.

14:23.662 --> 14:27.332
He shoots!
And... Pee yew!

14:27.334 --> 14:30.201
Hey! What do you mean?
I made it!

14:30.203 --> 14:33.471
Sorry, I mean...
[sniffs, groans]

14:33.473 --> 14:35.840
Something really stinks!

14:37.276 --> 14:40.979
Aye! Or should I say ew?

14:40.981 --> 14:42.680
We better check
it out, mateys.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.685
Whoa!

14:47.687 --> 14:50.922
I found the little stinker!
Right here!

14:50.924 --> 14:54.025
How about that?
It's a Skunk Bug.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.461
Oh, she's a little cutey!

14:56.463 --> 14:58.229
[sniffs, gasps]

14:58.231 --> 15:02.066
With a powerful...
perfume.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.068
I wonder how
she ended up here?

15:04.070 --> 15:07.038
I don't know,
but Pirate Island
isn't big enough

15:07.040 --> 15:09.974
for that Skunk Bug
and our crew...

15:09.976 --> 15:12.043
and we're not leavin'!

15:12.045 --> 15:14.178
Never Land is a big place.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.414
Maybe we can find a
home for her there!

15:16.416 --> 15:18.249
Like Stinkpot Swamp!

15:18.251 --> 15:20.718
C'mon, mateys, let's all
go find the Skunk Bug

15:20.720 --> 15:23.988
a place to live
where no one will mind
her stinky smell!

15:23.990 --> 15:26.324
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.794
Whenever we solve a
Pirate Problem together,
they'll appear.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.997
Then we'll collect 'em
and put them in our
Team Treasure Chest.

15:32.999 --> 15:36.067
Yo-ho, let's hold
our noses and go!

15:39.405 --> 15:42.473

15:56.755 --> 15:58.556
[snoring]

15:58.558 --> 16:03.761
[sighs] I'll never forget
me beloved Stinkette.

16:03.763 --> 16:08.866
How could you?
It smells like
she is still aboard!

16:08.868 --> 16:13.237
Are you sure you
only had one of
those bugs here?

16:13.239 --> 16:17.709
Oh, cap'n, there could
never be another bug
like me Stinkette.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.579

16:21.581 --> 16:24.182

16:26.086 --> 16:27.986
<i>¶ Stick around Skunk Bug </i>

16:32.925 --> 16:36.260
There you go, girl.
What do you think
of Stinkpot Swamp?

16:37.496 --> 16:40.198
I think she likes it here.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.634
Of course she does!
Stinkpot Swamp and that bug

16:43.636 --> 16:48.006
were made for each other...
they both stink! Pee-ew!

16:48.008 --> 16:49.707
Awesome coconuts!

16:49.709 --> 16:52.577
We took the Skunk Bug
to Stinkpot Swamp

16:52.579 --> 16:55.213
and we got four
gold doubloons.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.049
Let's grab 'em and
go get some fresh air!

16:58.751 --> 17:00.718
[croaking]

17:00.720 --> 17:02.286
[hooting]

17:02.288 --> 17:04.389
[Jake chuckles]
Looks like she really

17:04.391 --> 17:06.557
enjoys the music
of the swamp.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.959
- Goodbye little bug!
- Farewell!

17:07.961 --> 17:09.861
- See ya!
- Smell ya later!

17:16.301 --> 17:18.970
Yo-ho, crew!
Job well-done!

17:18.972 --> 17:22.440
Crackers!
It's the Jolly Roger.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.076
Flying a red distress flag.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.578
Old Feather Hat
must need our help!

17:27.580 --> 17:30.448
Ahoy, Captain Hook!
Are you in trouble?

17:30.450 --> 17:34.118
Aye! Me ship's
been overrun by...

17:34.120 --> 17:36.120
[all] Ewwwwwwwwwww!

17:36.122 --> 17:39.057
Stinky, smelly Skunk Bugs!

17:39.059 --> 17:43.661
Oh, help!
Shoo, bugs, shoo!

17:43.663 --> 17:46.431
Mr. Smee's got
bug trouble, too!

17:46.433 --> 17:50.735
I was making me
Codfish Stew when
they just came at me!

17:50.737 --> 17:53.805
Oh, they do smell awful!

17:53.807 --> 17:56.941
Shoo I say! Oh shoo!

17:56.943 --> 18:00.011
Hang tight, Mr. Smee!
We'll save ya!

18:02.548 --> 18:06.717
What do you know...
they were after me stew!

18:06.719 --> 18:09.053
[chuckling] They love it!

18:09.055 --> 18:12.023
Look, Sharky!
Another smelly
little friend.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.392
Looks like he wants
to hear a song.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.993
A-one! A-two!

18:15.995 --> 18:17.662

18:23.670 --> 18:25.236
[yelling]

18:25.238 --> 18:27.205
[Sharky] Do you see
what I just saw?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.307
We all saw it, Sharky!

18:29.309 --> 18:33.211
It's that tune!
It makes the Skunk Bugs
dance and multiply!

18:33.213 --> 18:35.813
Each one becomes two!

18:35.815 --> 18:40.418
And the tune sounds
exactly like the music
of Stinkpot Swamp.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.820
Oh no! I bet the swamp music

18:42.822 --> 18:46.824
is making even more
Skunk Bugs on Never Land!

18:46.826 --> 18:50.495
Oh dear, the whole place'll
be crawlin' with 'em!

18:50.497 --> 18:54.799
Captain Hook, we have
to go fix a Skunk Bug
problem on Never Land!

18:54.801 --> 18:57.001
We shall help you
puny pirates...

18:57.003 --> 19:02.673
if you promise to rid
the Jolly Roger of its
Skunk Bugs as well!

19:02.675 --> 19:04.208
We'll do our best!

19:04.210 --> 19:06.744
But... how can we
lure the bugs away from

19:06.746 --> 19:08.880
Never Land and
the Jolly Roger?

19:08.882 --> 19:11.782
We could use
Mr. Smee's Codfish Stew!

19:11.784 --> 19:13.751
The bugs really do love it!

19:13.753 --> 19:18.756
Correction... they did
love it! It's all gone!

19:18.758 --> 19:21.759
We'll have to
rustle up another
big batch of the stuff!

19:21.761 --> 19:24.629
Then we can lead the
Skunk Bugs far away...

19:24.631 --> 19:26.931
...to Far Faraway Island.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.601
Nobody lives there!
It's the perfect place for 'em!

19:30.603 --> 19:33.604
Yo-ho, mateys!
Let's get cookin'!

19:36.241 --> 19:38.576

Skunk Bugs off Never Land

19:55.528 --> 19:58.162
is definitely an emergency!

19:58.164 --> 20:00.565

20:00.567 --> 20:03.901
It's the Stew Brew
to the rescue!

20:04.937 --> 20:06.938
Don't forget the Jolly Roger!

20:06.940 --> 20:09.874
It's crawling
with stinky things.

20:09.876 --> 20:14.345
- No problem.
- Yoo-hoo! Skunk buggies!

20:14.347 --> 20:18.482
We've got a nice fresh
batch of Codfish Stew!

20:20.285 --> 20:24.822
Skunk Bugs can't fly!
How can they follow
our stinky pot o' stew?

20:24.824 --> 20:29.493
With a pinch more
pixie dust away!

20:33.098 --> 20:38.069
At last! Me ship
is Skunk Bug free!

20:38.071 --> 20:41.939
Yo-ho! For leading
the Skunk Bugs off
the Jolly Roger

20:41.941 --> 20:43.908
we got three more
gold doubloons!

20:43.910 --> 20:48.145
Let's grab 'em and go
to Stinkpot Swamp!

20:50.182 --> 20:53.417
Here we are!
Stinkpot Swamp!

20:53.419 --> 20:55.753

20:55.755 --> 20:57.955
There's a kajillion of them!

20:57.957 --> 21:01.892
[Jake] We were right!
The music is making
more and more Skunk Bugs!

21:01.894 --> 21:06.297

21:06.299 --> 21:10.234

Home, sweet... smelly home!

21:24.250 --> 21:27.184
Ugh!

21:27.186 --> 21:32.990
Yay-hey! We lured all
the stinky Skunk Bugs
to Far Faraway Island!

21:32.992 --> 21:35.726
And we got four more

22:36.456 --> 22:39.290

I learned from Mr. Smee.

<i>¶ You take a sailor song</i>
<i>with an old accordion ¶</i>

23:25.338 --> 23:28.973
¶ Then stew it up together
with some xylophone and drums ¶

23:28.975 --> 23:32.743
<i>¶ Stir it with guitar</i>
<i>and a dash of minor key ¶</i>

23:32.745 --> 23:34.812
<i>¶ Then sing across</i>
<i>the quarter deck ¶</i>

23:34.814 --> 23:38.549
<i>¶ And send it out to sea </i>

23:38.551 --> 23:42.052
¶ Yo-ho
Sing it from the Crew's Nest ¶

23:42.054 --> 23:45.656
<i>¶ Yo-ho</i>
<i>X it on the spot ¶</i>

23:45.658 --> 23:49.660
<i>¶ Yo-ho</i>
<i>Rock it on the ocean ¶</i>

23:49.662 --> 23:53.831
<i>¶ That's the recipe</i>
<i>for Pirate Rock ¶</i>

23:53.833 --> 23:57.701
<i>¶ Just like grandma</i>
<i>used to make it ¶</i>

23:57.703 --> 24:01.372
<i>¶ Mix it up in a galley pot </i>

24:01.374 --> 24:07.111
<i>¶ That's the recipe</i>
<i>for Pirate Rock ¶</i>
