Ollie! Look what I've got!

00:36.680 --> 00:38.680
Isn't he the cutest toy ever?

00:38.839 --> 00:41.320
His name is Mishka. And look!

00:41.440 --> 00:44.960
[giggles]
Neat. What else does it do?

00:45.080 --> 00:49.000
Oh, he cries, makes diapers,
and even upchucks!

00:49.400 --> 00:52.360
<i>Time to feed Mishka. Time to feed Mishka.</i>

00:52.519 --> 00:54.879
<i>-Time to feed Mishka.</i>
-Now what do I do?

00:55.040 --> 00:56.559
Is there an off button for this?

00:57.160 --> 01:00.000
No, Ollie. Mishka's an interactive toy!

01:00.160 --> 01:02.959
So you can take care of him
just like a real baby!

01:05.119 --> 01:07.560
-Don't you just love him?
-I love him a lot more

01:07.720 --> 01:09.520
now that he's quiet.

01:09.679 --> 01:12.600
Hold on. What's that? A name tag?

01:13.280 --> 01:15.600
"My name's Mishka.

01:15.759 --> 01:18.720
I live in Belkovo, in Russia.

01:18.880 --> 01:22.200
And I belong to... to..."

01:22.640 --> 01:25.000
The name's all rubbed off. Oh, well!

01:25.160 --> 01:27.839
Moon, I think this toy belongs to someone.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.600
No, I found him lying under
a park bench all by himself.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.039
But maybe someone lost him there.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.160
Well, you know what they say...

01:36.320 --> 01:39.039
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.679
[baby talks]
Know what else they say?

01:41.839 --> 01:44.360
Kids who lose their teddy bears cry!

01:44.479 --> 01:48.039
Moon, I'm having one of your brainstorms.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.160
Really? Are you sure you should?

01:50.320 --> 01:53.559
We have to take Mishka back home
to the kid who lost him.

01:53.679 --> 01:55.839
To Russia? That's too far.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.960
-Let's just send a letter.
-But that's too slow!

01:59.119 --> 02:01.759
Remember when I lost my favourite toy?

02:01.960 --> 02:04.679
-You mean Señor Fuzzy-Pants?
-Every minute without

02:04.839 --> 02:07.399
Señor Fuzzy-Pants felt like a year!

02:07.520 --> 02:09.960
Whoever lost Mishka must be so worried.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.359
We have to get him back fast! Come on!

02:14.000 --> 02:16.720
Ollie!
You can't just drag someone out the door

02:16.840 --> 02:18.280
before they've packed!

02:18.400 --> 02:22.440
Here. You hold Mishka
while I get his things.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.680
<i>Uh-oh!</i>
<i>Time to change Mishka's diaper!</i>

02:25.799 --> 02:28.440
Uh... Moon! Hurry!

02:34.799 --> 02:35.959
[laughs]

02:36.720 --> 02:38.480
Woo-hoo!

02:48.320 --> 02:51.239
<i>Now arriving in Russia!</i>

02:53.679 --> 02:57.519
Hmm. There's Belkovo,
where Mishka comes from.

02:57.679 --> 03:01.040
We just need to go through
this big forest they call the Taiga.

03:01.160 --> 03:04.120
Then Mishka will be back
to the kid who loves him best.

03:04.239 --> 03:06.959
But, Ollie, look at all this snow!

03:07.079 --> 03:10.079
We'll never get through it!
I better just keep Mishka,

03:10.239 --> 03:11.679
and we'll come back in the summer.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.959
Moon, wait!

03:17.799 --> 03:19.720
We can rent this sleigh
to get through the snow.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.600
But, Ollie,
you get woogly-tummy in sleighs.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.040
Plus you're scared of horses. Probably.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.239
Moon, this is no time
to think of ourselves.

03:29.359 --> 03:31.040
There's a sad kid out there,

03:31.200 --> 03:34.280
probably skating around
on his own frozen tears.

03:34.399 --> 03:36.560
Now hop on. I'll get our bags.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.560
Oh, boy.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.239
Mishka sure needs a lot...

03:40.399 --> 03:41.440
Wha!

03:46.399 --> 03:49.280
-So cold!
-Aw!

03:49.440 --> 03:51.079
And you don't like the cold!

03:51.239 --> 03:53.480
Let's wait for a snowplough to pass by

03:53.600 --> 03:56.200
and have a nice cup of hot of chocolate!

03:56.359 --> 03:59.519
Mmm! Hot chocolate?

03:59.679 --> 04:02.799
<i>Waah! Time to wipe Mishka's nose!</i>

04:04.560 --> 04:08.480
No! A kid is waiting
for his fuzzy buddy to come home!

04:08.600 --> 04:09.880
Let's move!

04:10.040 --> 04:11.600
Take us to Belkovo!

04:12.000 --> 04:13.320
Ha!

04:13.440 --> 04:15.440
Oh? Giddy-up!

04:16.760 --> 04:17.839
Please, horsey!

04:19.760 --> 04:22.159
Oh, guess the sleigh's broken down!

04:22.280 --> 04:24.440
Isn't that just our luck?

04:24.560 --> 04:27.240
-Well, better head home.
-I've got this, Moon.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.800
See? Horses love apples!
He'll chase after it!

04:35.320 --> 04:36.240
Hurray!

04:42.159 --> 04:45.680
Slow down, Ollie! You're jostling him!

04:46.520 --> 04:48.240
-Slower.
-Hmm?

04:48.360 --> 04:49.800
Slower.

04:50.479 --> 04:52.280
Slower...

04:52.840 --> 04:55.400
Ah! That's better.
[sighs]

04:55.560 --> 04:58.719
Moon, I get the feeling that
maybe you don't wanna get there.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.440
Well, I just think maybe the kid's parents

05:02.640 --> 05:04.400
have gotten him a new toy by now

05:04.560 --> 05:07.000
and he's forgotten all about Mishka.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.320
Moon, you've never lost a special toy.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.880
You don't know what it's like!
It's sad and lonely and...

05:13.240 --> 05:15.400
Ah! The bottle!

05:15.560 --> 05:17.120
We'll buy a new one in the village!

05:17.280 --> 05:20.240
<i>Time to feed Mishka. Time to feed Mishka.</i>

05:20.400 --> 05:22.240
<i>-Time to feed...</i>
-It's OK, Mishka!

05:22.360 --> 05:25.159
Uncle Ollie's going to stop.
Right, Uncle Ollie?

05:25.320 --> 05:27.880
<i>Time to feed Mishka. Time to feed Mishka.</i>

05:28.039 --> 05:29.520
All right!

05:29.640 --> 05:31.919
<i>Time to feed Mishka. Time to feed Mishka.</i>

05:34.760 --> 05:37.640
How am I supposed to find
a white bottle in white snow?

05:37.840 --> 05:40.320
<i>Time to feed Mishka. Time to feed Mishka.</i>

05:40.440 --> 05:42.359
-Uh?
<i>-Time to feed Mishka.</i>

05:43.479 --> 05:44.919
-Yeah!
-Woo-hoo!

05:45.039 --> 05:46.960
Who wants to thank Uncle Ollie?

05:51.320 --> 05:52.919
Hey! Come back here!

05:54.640 --> 05:57.520
Oh! What are we gonna do now?

05:57.680 --> 06:00.560
Belkovo is on the other side
of the forest.

06:00.680 --> 06:01.800
What's that, Mishka?

06:02.800 --> 06:04.320
You're right.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.960
We could try to go on and possibly freeze

06:08.280 --> 06:12.320
or we could fly back home
where it's nice and warm!

06:12.440 --> 06:15.840
A cosy fire in the fireplace
does sound wonderful.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.200
Mmm.

06:19.799 --> 06:23.919
[sighs]
But I don't have a fireplace at home.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.000
No! I'm on a mission!

06:26.159 --> 06:28.400
I have to get Mishka back!

06:35.240 --> 06:39.760
Ollie! Mishka looks tired.
Maybe we should turn back.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.640
Mmm-hmm.

06:45.039 --> 06:47.960
Ollie! Um... Mishka's looks cold.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.560
We should probably turn back.

06:54.799 --> 06:58.400
-Ollie! Mishka...
-Ah! Is home!

06:58.560 --> 07:00.200
We made it. Come on.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.880
Let's go find Mishka's rightful owner!

07:06.440 --> 07:08.560
Anybody missing this bear?

07:08.719 --> 07:11.640
No? Oh, well, we tried. Let's go!

07:11.799 --> 07:14.359
Moon, we have to look around for him more!

07:14.520 --> 07:16.799
Isn't Mishka's village beautiful?

07:17.479 --> 07:20.400
-What's going on?
-It's Maslenitsa,

07:20.560 --> 07:22.919
our end-of-winter festival.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.640
And we're celebrating with games
and cheese blinis!

07:26.799 --> 07:28.880
Ollie, look at these yummy-looking

07:29.039 --> 07:30.799
cheese-filled pancakes.

07:30.919 --> 07:34.680
-Cheese?
-Take your time! Enjoy them,

07:34.840 --> 07:37.840
while I look for a sleigh to ride back in.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.400
[sniffs] Oh...

07:39.560 --> 07:42.080
Would you like a teddy bear, dear?

07:42.200 --> 07:43.640
No, thank you.

07:43.799 --> 07:46.080
The only bear I want is Mishka,

07:46.239 --> 07:49.960
but I lost him when I was visiting
my cousins in Brooklyn.

07:50.120 --> 07:54.000
[sniffs]
I've had him since I was a baby.

07:54.840 --> 07:58.200
He sleeps with me
and I take him to school.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.760
I miss him so much.

08:01.799 --> 08:03.760
[blows his nose]

08:05.120 --> 08:06.679
Here's your Mishka!

08:07.280 --> 08:09.440
Huh? Oh, no!

08:11.120 --> 08:13.200
Oh, Ollie, you were right!

08:13.320 --> 08:16.760
I didn't realise how sad it is
to lose your teddy bear.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.799
And I want to give Mishka back now!

08:18.919 --> 08:21.880
Mmm. That's really kind of you, Moon.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.799
I know how much you like Mishka.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.440
The boy who lost him
was wearing a red hat.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.840
I saw him, but then I lost him.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.320
Come on!

08:33.640 --> 08:34.480
No.

08:36.319 --> 08:37.159
Mmm-mmm.

08:38.919 --> 08:39.919
No.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.400
-Mmm-mmm.
-So many red hats!

08:43.520 --> 08:45.319
How will we ever find him?

08:46.800 --> 08:49.840
Ollie, I just had a brainstorm!

08:54.400 --> 08:55.959
-No!
-Yes!

08:56.160 --> 08:59.079
I'm sure we'll be able
to see him from up there!

08:59.199 --> 09:01.680
Gather around, everyone,

09:01.800 --> 09:05.040
and try the greasy pole challenge.

09:05.199 --> 09:10.040
If you can make it to the top,
you'll win fabulous prizes!

09:10.160 --> 09:11.880
Hold on. It's greasy?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.880
To make it slippery and hard to climb!

09:15.040 --> 09:17.920
It's one of our festival games!

10:17.240 --> 10:18.400
Thanks to you, Moon!

I know it was hard to give Mishka up!

[sniffs]
But it was the right thing to do.

10:24.959 --> 10:27.520
Thank you for bringing Mishka back!

Here's a Matryoshka doll,
a souvenir for you!

10:32.560 --> 10:34.920
-Whoa! Thank you!
-Whoa! Thanks!

10:37.760 --> 10:40.439
Ollie, look! Inside the big doll,

10:40.600 --> 10:42.240
there were a bunch of smaller dolls!

10:42.640 --> 10:44.000
That's so neat, Moon!

10:44.120 --> 10:45.959
Want to go to the park
and play with them?

10:46.120 --> 10:49.240
Sure. But... What's all this?

10:49.439 --> 10:52.520
Six times the dolls, six times the stuff!

10:52.640 --> 10:56.040
But don't you worry.
Uncle Ollie will take care of it.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.319
Yes, he will! Oh, yes, he will!

10:58.480 --> 11:00.000
