KEVIN: Sir, we need to be moving out.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.320
- The plane is on standby.
- I say when the plane leaves, Kevin.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.595
What do you need, money?

01:08.760 --> 01:13.118
It's not the money, sir.
It's the logistics and the scale.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.636
It's too big, too complex.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.590
And, of course, the confidentiality,
it's potentially very exposing

01:19.920 --> 01:20.920
for all of us.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.032
But especially for you.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.510
Frankie,

01:27.120 --> 01:28.395
we're family, right?

01:29.520 --> 01:30.795
I mean, you're my...

01:34.160 --> 01:35.896
- What are you again?
- I'm your niece's wife, sir.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.196
Exactly. But you get things done.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.273
- (EXHALES SHARPLY)
- Now, this could destroy me for 2020.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.478

01:54.560 --> 01:55.789
Thought I was the only one in.

01:57.040 --> 02:00.238
I just came in to check everything
was all right before we opened.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.470
Who the hell is this?

02:02.720 --> 02:06.794
I'm Najia. I... I didn't realise
that you were in here

02:06.920 --> 02:09.196
or here at all. Wow.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.015
I thought I told you to stay
on the door, Kevin.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.555
I came through the door to tell you
we had to leave, sir.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.080
Unbelievable.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.720
What, do you, uh,
work for me or something?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.632
Yes, I'll be the general manager.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.393
Er, I thought while we were finalising

02:21.480 --> 02:24.080
I'd come in and familiarise myself so I
can hit the ground running

02:24.160 --> 02:25.992
- when we officially open.
- You're fired.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.676
Pardon?

02:28.560 --> 02:30.233
You're fired. Get out.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.314
- I'm so sorry.
- You have one hour

02:33.400 --> 02:35.551
to tell me how you're gonna
make this all go away.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.800
Okay?

02:38.960 --> 02:40.997

But no messages.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.755
But, to be fair, it's only half an hour
since you left.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.720
What, half an hour since we were
with you in that warehouse?

03:56.880 --> 03:57.880
Yeah.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.833
Oh, you know, back in the box.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.830
- There's loads to see.
- By yourself?

04:33.480 --> 04:34.755
Yeah, I suppose.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.640
- Do you want to come for tea at mine?
- Definitely!

04:41.320 --> 04:43.437
Yes, I would. Thanks. I love tea.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.037
Are you coming?
Are we all going for tea at Yaz's?

04:48.840 --> 04:49.990
She didn't invite us.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.796
Don't be daft. Of course you're invited.

if that's all right.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.160
Shall I come with you?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.194
I'd rather do it alone.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.433
I should get one. I'd be good in a flat.

I could get a sofa.
Imagine me with a sofa.

A purple one, and sit on it.

- A little bit, yeah.

she'd do something about it.

No, no, no. No, we need to get
as far away from that thing as possible.

Those aren't normal cobwebs.

26:28.720 --> 26:29.756

Very efficient, very highly-rated
internationally.

34:37.560 --> 34:41.395

waste and build a luxury hotel on top.

Smart business planning.
Perfect vertical integration.

are built this way?

34:46.560 --> 34:48.040
Not quite perfect, I'm afraid.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.270
Not quite efficient.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.072
A blocked-in site pumping out

34:51.199 --> 34:53.476
methane and sulphides
and trichloroethylene.

34:53.600 --> 34:57.196
Never mind the specialist material
that hasn't been properly preserved.

34:57.280 --> 35:01.638
A soup of toxic waste,
incredibly badly managed.

35:01.720 --> 35:05.509
I mean, there's no outlet for it.
It's just building and marinading

35:05.600 --> 35:07.512
and becoming more and more toxic.

35:07.960 --> 35:10.759
- It's a botched job!
- I didn't know.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.360

this site is unsafe.

35:18.720 --> 35:23.192
Okay, all right. You're right.
That's why I came here.

35:23.400 --> 35:27.792
ApparentlyJLR was a little overzealous
in cutting corners

35:27.880 --> 35:30.031
and worried about
keeping the bottom line

35:30.120 --> 35:31.520
instead of doing the right thing.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.638
But I just sign the contracts, okay?

35:35.080 --> 35:37.276
I expect other people to do theirjobs.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.511

You'll never have to work again.

JLR takes the waste from our lab.

36:05.440 --> 36:08.274
Our aborted experiments
and our spider carcasses.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.517
And they're all in there.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.632
Your spider carcasses
in his toxic waste!

36:12.720 --> 36:15.519
Not my fault! I didn't know anything
about spider carcasses.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.115
Of course you didn't!
You don't know anything.

36:24.120 --> 36:28.034
Spiders bioengineered for stronger
cobwebs, prolonged life.

36:28.240 --> 36:31.870
Because spiders can keep growing
as long as they live.

36:32.080 --> 36:35.118
What if our waste included something
that we thought was dead,

36:35.200 --> 36:37.112
but was stilljust alive?

36:37.240 --> 36:40.039
And with enough food
in all that waste to survive,

46:26.960 --> 46:32.194
You see, Doc, the thing about grief
is it needs time and...

46:35.360 --> 46:38.512
Well, I don't want to sit around
my house waiting for it to go away.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.152
'Cause that house is full of Grace,
and it makes it so much harder.

46:44.080 --> 46:46.470
But, er...

46:47.240 --> 46:49.914
Being with you and seeing
all these things...

46:51.400 --> 46:52.400
It really helps.

46:55.480 --> 46:56.596
What about you?

46:56.920 --> 46:59.879
Do you really think I want to go back
to working in that warehouse?

46:59.960 --> 47:01.280
No way.

47:02.040 --> 47:03.394
Yaz, you wanted to come home.

47:04.560 --> 47:05.560
I know.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.555
I love my family,

47:09.640 --> 47:11.916
but they also drive me
completely insane.

47:13.360 --> 47:14.430
I want more.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.759
More of the universe.

47:18.560 --> 47:19.560
More time with you.

47:22.400 --> 47:24.040
You're like the best person
I've ever met.

47:25.240 --> 47:26.240
You're pretty awesome.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.994
You're all right, I suppose.

47:30.840 --> 47:31.956
(SIGHS)

47:33.120 --> 47:34.840
I can't guarantee
that you're gonna be safe.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.354
- We know.
- Do you?

47:37.680 --> 47:39.592
Really? 'Cause when I pull that lever,

47:39.680 --> 47:41.478
I'm never quite sure
what's gonna happen.

47:41.600 --> 47:42.600
That's okay.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.320
You're not gonna come back
as the same people that left here.

47:45.480 --> 47:47.312
But that's all right.
I think that's good.

47:49.720 --> 47:50.720
Be sure.

47:52.920 --> 47:53.920
All of you.

47:58.080 --> 47:59.080
Be sure.

48:01.600 --> 48:02.600
Sure.

48:06.480 --> 48:07.675
Sure.

48:08.680 --> 48:09.680
Deffo.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.712
Look at you!

48:14.760 --> 48:18.197
My fam! No, still doesn't quite work.
Team TARDIS?

48:18.920 --> 48:20.957
Mmm. We'll take that.

48:21.640 --> 48:22.676
Welcome aboard.

48:23.240 --> 48:24.240
Properly.

48:24.880 --> 48:26.030
(GASPS)

48:26.400 --> 48:27.720
Do you want to do it together?

48:37.680 --> 48:39.114
I love this bit.

48:40.840 --> 48:42.513
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

49:10.640 --> 49:11.640
DOCTOR: Sonic mine.

49:11.920 --> 49:12.990
YASMIN: <i>Where are we?</i>

49:13.080 --> 49:14.120
GRAHAM: <i>We're in hospital.</i>

49:14.160 --> 49:15.879
<i>So it's just us, alone.</i>
