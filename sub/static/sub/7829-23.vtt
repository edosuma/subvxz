Oh, I'm panicking, Neddy.

This is Kent Brockman

01:07.901 --> 01:10.653
with a special report from
the Channel 6 news copter.

01:10.737 --> 01:14.199
A large bear-like animal,
most likely a bear,

01:14.282 --> 01:16.576
has wandered down from the hills
in search of food

01:16.659 --> 01:17.952
or perhaps employment.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.454
Please, remain calm.

01:19.537 --> 01:20.538
Stay in your homes.

01:26.669 --> 01:30.632
Looks like bad news for the...

01:30.715 --> 01:31.716
Impson family.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.761
Let's all calm down.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.013
Everyone's going to be just fine

01:37.097 --> 01:38.932
as long as I've got
enough beer.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.477
(screams)

01:42.560 --> 01:44.813
All right,
that does it.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.439
If I'm going to be trapped
inside the house

01:46.523 --> 01:48.525
I got to go out
and buy some beer.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.906
(growling)

01:54.989 --> 01:58.118
Now to drop gracefully
through the windshield.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.996
Ahh!

02:02.080 --> 02:03.957
I got you, Dad!

02:04.040 --> 02:04.958
Ahh!

02:09.462 --> 02:10.964
(siren wails)

02:14.759 --> 02:17.345
Sweet dreams, Smokey.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.972
Oww!

02:19.055 --> 02:20.932
Animal tranquilizer!

02:23.601 --> 02:25.228
Ohh...

Smooth.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.024
(belches)

02:34.529 --> 02:36.156
Book 'em, Lou.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.658
One count
of being a bear.

02:38.741 --> 02:39.993
And one count

02:40.076 --> 02:42.078
of being an accessory
to being a bear.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.038
(men grunting)

02:49.544 --> 02:50.670
(grunting)

02:50.753 --> 02:52.881
Oh, Marge,
it was horrible.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.550
We were trapped
in the house all afternoon

02:55.633 --> 02:57.051
and... well...

02:57.135 --> 03:00.013
we had to drink
toilet water.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.223
Well, things were
bad everywhere.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.392
I'm sick of these
constant bear attacks!

03:04.475 --> 03:07.395
It's like a freakin' country
bear jamboroo around here.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.522
Well, now,
realistically, Homer,

03:09.606 --> 03:11.357
I've lived here
some 30-odd years.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.610
This is the first
and only bear I've ever seen.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.028
Hey,

03:15.111 --> 03:17.655
if you want wild bears
eating your children

03:17.739 --> 03:18.948
and scaring away
your salmon,

03:19.032 --> 03:20.408
that's your business.

03:20.491 --> 03:21.784
But I'm not gonna take it!

03:21.868 --> 03:23.494
Who's with me?

03:23.578 --> 03:24.996
ALL: I am!

03:26.623 --> 03:28.333
HOMER:
We're here! We're queer!

03:28.416 --> 03:30.710
We don't want any more bears!

03:30.793 --> 03:32.420
ALL:
We're here! We're queer!

03:32.503 --> 03:34.714
We don't want any more bears!

03:34.797 --> 03:36.132
Hey Homer,
that's a pretty catchy chant.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.175
Where'd you learn it?

03:37.258 --> 03:38.676
Oh, I heard it

03:38.760 --> 03:40.887
at the mustache parade
they have every year.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.388
ALL: We don't want
any more bears!

03:42.472 --> 03:44.682
Sir, there's an unruly
mob to see you.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.100
Does it have
an appointment?

03:46.184 --> 03:47.852
Uh... yes it does.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.687
I phoned ahead.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.023
Mr. Mayor, I hate
to break it to you

03:52.106 --> 03:54.525
but your city
is infested with bears.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.403
And these ones are smarter
than the average bear.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.364
They swiped my
pic-a-nic basket.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.698
Think of the children.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.283
Very well.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.160
I promise swift
and decisive action

04:04.244 --> 04:06.329
against these
hibernating hucksters.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.331
(cheering)

04:09.958 --> 04:11.584
(chuckling)

04:14.879 --> 04:16.756
(siren wailing)

04:19.842 --> 04:21.803
Ahh, not a bear in sight.

04:21.886 --> 04:25.431
The bear patrol must
be working like a charm.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.100
That's specious
reasoning, Dad.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.351
Thank you, honey.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.978
By your logic,
I could claim

04:30.061 --> 04:31.813
that this rock
keeps tigers away.

04:31.896 --> 04:32.814
Oh, how does it work?

04:32.897 --> 04:34.440
It doesn't work.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.192
-Uh-huh.
-It's just a stupid rock.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.278
-Uh-huh.
-But I don't see

04:38.361 --> 04:40.655
any tigers around here.
Do you?

04:40.738 --> 04:44.033
Lisa, I
want to buy your rock.

04:50.748 --> 04:51.958
Woo-hoo!

04:52.041 --> 04:53.668
A perfect day--
Zero bears

04:53.751 --> 04:57.088
and one
big fat hairy paycheck!

04:57.171 --> 04:59.424
Hey!
How come my pay is so low?

04:59.507 --> 05:01.926
"Bear Patrol Tax: $5..."

05:02.010 --> 05:04.554
What?!
This is an outrage!

05:04.637 --> 05:07.348
It's the biggest tax increase
in history!

05:07.432 --> 05:10.184
Actually, Dad, it's the smallest
tax increase in history.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.602
Let the bears
pay the Bear Tax!

05:11.686 --> 05:13.021
I pay the Homer tax!

05:13.104 --> 05:14.522
That's the Home-owner Tax.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.274
Well, anyway,
I'm still outraged.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.697
ALL:
Down with taxes!

05:22.780 --> 05:25.366
Down with taxes!
Down with taxes!

05:25.450 --> 05:28.536
Won't you think
of the children?

05:28.619 --> 05:31.414
Are these morons
getting dumber or just louder?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.291
Dumber, sir.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.251
They won't give up
the bear patrol

05:35.335 --> 05:36.669
but they won't pay taxes
for it either.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.964
Ducking this issue
calls for real leadership.

05:40.048 --> 05:45.845
People, your taxes are high
because of illegal immigrants!

05:45.928 --> 05:48.931
That's right--
illegal immigrants!

05:49.015 --> 05:50.516
We need to get rid of them!

05:50.600 --> 05:52.518
(overlapping chatter)

05:52.602 --> 05:54.562
Immiggants!
I knew it was them!

05:54.645 --> 05:55.730
Even when it
was the bears

05:55.813 --> 05:57.398
I knew it was them!

05:57.482 --> 06:01.486
Oh, won't somebody
please think of the children?

06:01.569 --> 06:04.322
In one week, the town will vote
on a special referendum--

06:04.405 --> 06:05.740
whether or not to deport

06:05.823 --> 06:08.117
all illegal immigrants
from Springfield.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.620
It shall be known
as Proposition 24.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.038
(cheering)

06:18.795 --> 06:20.588
Hey, German boy,

06:20.671 --> 06:23.674
go back to Germania!

06:23.758 --> 06:25.593
I do not deserve this.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.721
I have come here legally
as an exchange student.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.932
Young man, the only thing
we exchanged for you

06:31.015 --> 06:32.683
was our national dignity.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.395
(laughter)

06:35.478 --> 06:37.313
You want to
pick on immigrants?!

06:37.397 --> 06:39.941
-Then pick on Willie!
-Willie, please.

06:40.024 --> 06:43.236
The children want to pick on
someone their own size.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.320
Ach...

06:48.074 --> 06:49.784
(eating loudly)

06:49.867 --> 06:53.371
I don't see how you can support
Proposition 24, Dad.

06:53.454 --> 06:54.872
Open your eyes, Lisa.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.542
Our schools are so
jam-packed with immigrants,

06:57.625 --> 07:00.002
kids like Bart have
lost the will to learn.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.504
There's no
denying it, sis.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.048
But immigration is
what America is all about.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.843
Even the Simpson family
immigrated to America.

07:06.926 --> 07:07.844
Right, Grampa?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.971
Okay, you
twisted my arm.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.099
The Simpson story begins
back in the old country.

07:13.182 --> 07:16.060
<i>I forget which one exactly.</i>

07:16.144 --> 07:19.522
<i>My father would drone</i>
<i>on and on about America.</i>

07:19.605 --> 07:21.065
<i>He thought it was</i>

07:21.149 --> 07:23.151
<i>the greatest thing</i>
<i>since sliced bread--</i>

07:23.234 --> 07:26.487
<i>sliced bread having been invented</i>
<i>the previous winter.</i>

07:26.571 --> 07:27.947
See this, son?

07:28.030 --> 07:29.907
That's where we're
going to live.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.076
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow...

07:32.160 --> 07:33.661
but someday.

07:33.744 --> 07:37.498
<i>Later that day,</i>
<i>we set sail for America.</i>

07:37.582 --> 07:39.167
There it is.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.376
Our new home.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.465
Whee!
I love America!

07:45.548 --> 07:47.383
Abe! Supper's on!

07:47.467 --> 07:50.470
We had to move out once we'd
filled the head with garbage.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.471
The end.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.809
Yeah, when those immigrants
get deported

07:56.893 --> 07:58.394
there'll be
a lot more elbow room

07:58.478 --> 08:00.521
for regular Joes
like you and me, Apu.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.898
Ah... Mr. Simpson,

08:01.981 --> 08:03.608
it may astonish you
to learn

08:03.691 --> 08:04.942
that I am
an immigrant.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.360
You? Pfft.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.778
I don't believe it.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.114
No, in truth
an illegal immigrant, sir.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.200
If Proposition 24 passes,

08:12.283 --> 08:15.453
I shall be forced
to leave this country.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.580
Oh, I wish...

08:17.663 --> 08:20.500
Oh, I wish I could have stayed
just one more year or two.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.668
There was so much
I wanted to see

08:22.752 --> 08:24.879
and to do
and to have done to me.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.380
Oh, my God.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.049
I got so swept up

08:28.132 --> 08:30.801
in the scapegoating
and fun of Proposition 24,

08:30.885 --> 08:32.261
I never stopped to think

08:32.345 --> 08:35.806
it might affect
someone I cared about.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.185
You know what, Apu...

08:39.268 --> 08:42.980
I am really,
really gonna miss you.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.941
(whistling)

08:56.869 --> 08:58.788
You know what really
aggravazes me?

08:58.871 --> 09:00.456
Is them immiggants--

09:00.540 --> 09:01.832
They want all
the benefits

09:01.916 --> 09:03.125
of living
in Springfield,

09:03.209 --> 09:04.502
but they ain't
even bothered

09:04.585 --> 09:06.170
to learn themself
the language.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.173
Yeah. Those are exactly
my sentimonies.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.218
(babbling incoherently)

09:12.301 --> 09:14.303
Yeah,
you said it, Barn.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.813
Make the protesters go away

09:23.896 --> 09:26.190
and I'll give you
the entire bottle.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.358
Oh, thank you goodness.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.694
My first customers
in a week.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.738
It's hard to believe someone
so close to our family

09:32.822 --> 09:34.240
could be an illegal alien.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.658
Alas, it is true.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.369
I came here shortly
after my graduation

09:38.452 --> 09:39.495
from Cal Tech--

09:39.579 --> 09:41.414
<i>Calcutta Technical Institute.</i>

09:41.497 --> 09:42.957
<i>As the top student</i>

09:43.040 --> 09:45.126
<i>in my graduating class</i>
<i>of seven million,</i>

09:45.209 --> 09:47.795
<i>I was accepted for</i>
<i>graduate study</i>

09:47.878 --> 09:49.463
<i>in the United States.</i>

09:55.428 --> 09:58.222
Wherever you go
and whatever you do,

09:58.306 --> 10:00.349
we will always love you.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.226
Make us proud, son.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.353
Never forget
who you are.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.521
I won't, Mother,

10:05.605 --> 10:07.815
and I won't
forget you, Manjula.

10:07.898 --> 10:10.234
I'm so sorry
our arranged marriage

10:10.318 --> 10:11.444
will not come to pass.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.279
Farewell, my beloved.

10:13.362 --> 10:14.947
<i>I enrolled at</i>
<i>Springfield Heights</i>

10:15.031 --> 10:16.574
<i>Institute of Technology</i>

10:16.657 --> 10:18.659
<i>under the tutelage</i>
<i>of the brilliant</i>

10:18.743 --> 10:20.620
<i>Professor John Frink.</i>

10:20.703 --> 10:23.372
Well, sure, the Frinkiac 7
looks impressive--

10:23.456 --> 10:24.707
Don't touch it.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.126
But I predict
that within 100 years

10:27.209 --> 10:29.462
computers will be
twice as powerful

10:29.545 --> 10:32.131
10,000 times larger
and so expensive

10:32.214 --> 10:35.968
that only the five richest kings
of Europe will own them.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.179
Could it be used
for dating?

10:38.262 --> 10:39.555
Well, theoretically, yes,

10:39.639 --> 10:42.642
but the computer matches
would be so perfect

10:42.725 --> 10:46.062
as to eliminate the thrill
of romantic conquest.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.229
(mumbling)

10:47.313 --> 10:48.856
Nine glorious
years later

10:48.939 --> 10:51.233
I completed
my Ph.D. thesis.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.111
200,000 precisely
ordered punch cards

10:54.195 --> 10:56.280
comprising the world's
very first

10:56.364 --> 10:57.823
tic-tac-toe program.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.576
Only the top human
players could beat it.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.994
Hey, what's this one for?

11:02.078 --> 11:03.079
Ohh!

11:04.538 --> 11:06.707
So, Apu, why didn't you
go back to India

11:06.791 --> 11:08.834
when your Student Visa
expired?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.503
I did not feel
right leaving

11:10.586 --> 11:12.338
without paying off
my student loans.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.673
Mm-hmm.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.175
So I took a job
at the Kwik-E-Mart.

11:16.258 --> 11:19.345
When my debts were wiped clean,
I was all set to go,

11:19.428 --> 11:22.556
but by then, I had made
so many friends here.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.393
What you're saying
is so understandable

11:25.476 --> 11:28.562
and really, your only crime
was violating U.S. law.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.148
Oh, you are one
of the good ones.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.483
You know what?

11:32.566 --> 11:35.528
I'm going to vote "no" on 24.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.321
Mom, you're the greatest.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.407
Can I have this licorice?

11:43.452 --> 11:46.497
Uh, good evening, young man.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.624
My name is Charles Norwood.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.710
Furthermore, to this beer,

11:50.793 --> 11:54.422
I would also like three
of your finest, cheapest cigars.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.966
Here's my I.D.,
which confirms my adultivity.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.721
Hm.

12:01.804 --> 12:05.182
Hey, Kearney, this fake I.D.,
it is truly excellent.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.729
Say, if you tell me
where you obtained it,

12:09.812 --> 12:12.565
I will overlook
the ice cream sandwiches

12:12.648 --> 12:14.233
concealed in
your armpits, eh?

12:14.316 --> 12:15.985
Deal.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.784
Okay, here are
your fraudulent documents

12:23.868 --> 12:25.953
Mr. Nahasapeemapetilan:

12:26.036 --> 12:28.414
your U.S. Passport,
Social Security card

12:28.497 --> 12:31.584
birth certificate
and your death certificate.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.754
Just hold on to that one
in your safe-deposit box.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.423
Most humble and grateful
thanks to you.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.175
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.426
Can the courtesy.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.886
You're an American now.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.889
Remember: you were born
in Green Bay, Wisconsin,

12:44.972 --> 12:48.309
your parents were Herb
and Judy Nahasapeemapetilan,

12:48.392 --> 12:50.811
and if you do not wish
to arouse suspicion,

12:50.895 --> 12:54.148
I strongly urge you
to act American.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.818
(American accent)
Hey there, Homer.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.028
How's it hanging?

12:59.111 --> 13:00.279
Low and lazy.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.739
So...

13:02.865 --> 13:05.201
Hey, say something again.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.286
Oh, you're just noticing

13:07.369 --> 13:09.205
the way I'm talking
to you now.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.081
You see, it turns out

13:11.165 --> 13:13.751
I am an American citizen
after all.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.837
Apparently, I just
plumb forgot about it.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.464
(phony chuckle)

13:18.547 --> 13:21.675
Say, let's take a relaxed
attitude toward work

13:21.759 --> 13:23.677
and watch
the baseball match.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.514
The NY Mets are my
favorite squadron.

13:26.597 --> 13:30.518
Hey, you got rid of that goofy
sacred elephant statue.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.769
Oh, yeah.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.146
What was I thinking
with that?

13:34.230 --> 13:38.692
(accent slipping) Who needs the infinite
compassion of Ganesha

13:38.776 --> 13:41.570
when I've got Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman

13:41.654 --> 13:44.156
staring at me
from Entertainment Weekly

13:44.240 --> 13:45.908
with their dead eyes?!

13:45.991 --> 13:47.368
Look at me!

13:47.451 --> 13:49.829
I've betrayed my Indian
heritage, sir.

13:49.912 --> 13:53.374
What would my parents
think of me now?

13:53.457 --> 13:54.750
(gasps)

13:54.834 --> 13:56.252
APU'S FATHER:
Make us proud, son.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.921
APU'S MOTHER:
Never forget who you are.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.882
Don't make
the same mistake I did.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.509
(gasps)

14:03.592 --> 14:07.221
Oh, forgive me, Mother, Father.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.639
I failed you.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.102
(sniffling)

14:14.979 --> 14:16.564
Who am I kidding?

14:16.647 --> 14:17.898
I am no citizen.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.776
Th-This passport
is a cheap forgery.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.321
A cheap $2,000 forgery.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.365
I have brought shame
to my parents,

14:26.448 --> 14:28.117
to my homeland and to myself.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.118
Don't forget Ganesha.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.372
I cannot deny my roots

14:33.455 --> 14:35.791
and I cannot keep up
this charade.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.377
I only did it
because I love this land

14:38.460 --> 14:41.338
where I have the freedom
to say and to think

14:41.422 --> 14:43.007
and to charge
whatever I want.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.718
I want to stay,
but as the real me,

14:45.801 --> 14:48.095
not as some yahoo
from Green Bay.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.184
(sobbing)

14:54.268 --> 14:56.395
Wow. You must
love this country

14:56.478 --> 14:58.230
more than I love
a cold beer

14:58.314 --> 15:00.107
on a hot
Christmas morning.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.525
Darn it, Apu.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.944
I'm not gonna let them
kick you out.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.195
(grunting)

15:05.279 --> 15:07.239
I never should have
bought this button.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.407
Can I have
my three dollars back?

15:08.490 --> 15:10.367
Store credit only.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.039
HOMER: Hey, Marge.
Look who I brought home.

15:15.122 --> 15:19.251
Oh, Homer. Are you
rounding up immigrants?

15:19.335 --> 15:21.378
(laughs)
No, Marge.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.422
Apu convinced me
that Proposition 24

15:23.505 --> 15:24.924
is a big mistake.

15:25.007 --> 15:25.925
All right!

15:26.008 --> 15:27.009
Now you've got

15:27.092 --> 15:28.886
all the Simpsons
behind you, Apu.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.554
That's nice--
although three of you

15:30.638 --> 15:31.889
are below voting age.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.641
And I'm not registered.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.517
I do appreciate
your concern, really,

15:35.601 --> 15:36.769
but it is hopeless.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.228
The latest poll shows

15:38.312 --> 15:41.690
a whooping 85% support
for Proposition 24.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.734
Hey, Apu,
why don't you just

15:43.817 --> 15:45.694
marry some American broad

15:45.778 --> 15:48.447
then dump her after you
get your citizenship?

15:48.530 --> 15:49.490
(touch tones)

15:49.573 --> 15:51.367
Hello, Selma?

15:51.450 --> 15:53.494
Selma, my dear,
how are you?

15:53.577 --> 15:55.621
Uh-huh...
uh-huh... uh-huh...

15:55.704 --> 15:57.665
Listen,
shut up for a second.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.500
How would you like
to marry Apu

15:59.583 --> 16:00.501
so he doesn't get deported?

16:00.584 --> 16:02.211
I'd rather eat poison.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.547
My name's already Selma Bouvier
Terwilliger Hutz McClure.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.759
God knows it's long enough
with Nahasapeemapet-whatever.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.720
From now on,
I'm only marrying for love...

16:11.804 --> 16:13.889
and possibly
once more for money.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.937
Oh, it's hopeless.
Oh, poor Apu.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.107
Hey! The government
don't control the sky.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.109
What if you lived
in a balloon?!

16:25.192 --> 16:27.695
-LISA: That's it!
-Did you hear that, Mom?

16:27.778 --> 16:29.071
She's as dumb as me.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.865
No, not what he said,
what he is!

16:31.949 --> 16:33.283
Grandfather,

16:33.367 --> 16:35.369
as in "grandfather clause."

16:35.452 --> 16:38.080
Apu, how long ago
did your Visa expire?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.665
Seven years, but I don't--

16:39.748 --> 16:41.250
(gasps)
There was an amnesty declared

16:41.333 --> 16:43.877
for people who've been here
as long as you.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.546
That means you can take
the citizenship test!

16:45.629 --> 16:46.755
(gasps)

16:46.839 --> 16:48.173
But Apu, the vote
on Proposition 24

16:48.257 --> 16:49.550
is on Tuesday.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.136
You'll have to pass
the test before then.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.596
Oh, no! That is not
nearly enough time

16:54.680 --> 16:57.349
to learn over 200 years
of American history.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.809
Oh, it can't be that many!

16:58.892 --> 17:00.227
Come on, Apu!

17:00.310 --> 17:01.729
I'll be your tutor.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.605
(ominous chords blare)

17:06.025 --> 17:08.610
Please identify
this object.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.112
It appears to be the flag

17:10.195 --> 17:12.448
which disappeared from
the public library last year.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.907
Correct.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.702
Now, we all know the 13 stripes
are for good luck,

17:16.785 --> 17:21.290
but why does the American flag
have precisely 47 stars?

17:21.373 --> 17:25.377
Because this particular flag
is ridiculously out of date.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.212
The library
must have purchased it

17:27.296 --> 17:28.297
during the brief period
in 1912

17:28.380 --> 17:30.466
after New Mexico
became a state

17:30.549 --> 17:31.508
but before Arizona did.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.385
Uh, partial credit.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.847
Now, they may ask you
to locate your town

17:36.930 --> 17:39.266
on a map of the U.S.,
so let's do that.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.977
Uh... Springfield,
Springfield... um...

17:42.061 --> 17:44.146
-right here.
-LISA: Dad!

17:44.229 --> 17:46.899
You're not pointing
anywhere near Springfield.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.233
It's over here, Apu.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.818
Hey, whatcha doin'?
Studying?

17:49.902 --> 17:51.904
Oh, I'm so confused.
I don't even know where

17:51.987 --> 17:53.614
I'm getting
kicked out of anymore.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.956
Whoa!

18:03.040 --> 18:05.459
Sign's floating
away, Chief.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.796
Executive, legislative,
and, uh... judicial.

18:08.879 --> 18:12.132
No, no, and no.
(groans)

18:12.216 --> 18:15.135
Maybe we should start all over
with the electrical college.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.596
Please, Mr. Simpson,
my brain needs sleep.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.264
The test is in six hours

18:19.348 --> 18:21.141
and many of these facts
you speak of

18:21.225 --> 18:22.184
are completely new to me.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.186
Sleep is for the weak, Apu!

18:24.269 --> 18:25.604
Now I'm gonna go to bed
while you look over

18:25.687 --> 18:27.773
my notes from
ninth grade history.

18:27.856 --> 18:28.941
Okay, Apu.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.984
Stay awake and stay focused.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.236
Cotton Mather...

18:32.319 --> 18:34.196
(snoring)

18:39.076 --> 18:41.370
Oh, no! I fell asleep!

18:41.453 --> 18:43.997
I have forgotten everything
that Mr. Homer taught me!

18:44.081 --> 18:45.999
Perfect.
Let's roll.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.006
(crowd clamoring)

18:58.011 --> 18:58.971
Hm.

18:59.054 --> 18:59.972
Hm!

19:01.974 --> 19:02.891
Hmm.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.855
(gasps)

19:07.938 --> 19:09.148
All right, men.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.691
Here's the order
of deportations.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.943
First, you'll be
rounding up your tired,

19:13.026 --> 19:14.528
then your poor,

19:14.611 --> 19:17.906
then your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.449
Breathers. Got it.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.326
All right. Here's
your last question.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.662
What was the cause
of the Civil War?

19:23.745 --> 19:25.664
Actually,
there were numerous causes.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.291
Aside from the obvious schism

19:27.374 --> 19:30.002
between abolitionists
and anti-abolitionists,

19:30.085 --> 19:32.754
economic factors, both domestic
and international, played a significant--

19:32.838 --> 19:33.839
-Hey, hey.
-Yeah?

19:33.922 --> 19:35.382
Just-- Just say "slavery."

19:35.465 --> 19:36.508
Slavery it is, sir.

19:37.801 --> 19:40.137
Yes! I am a citizen!

19:40.220 --> 19:42.681
Now which way to
the Welfare office?!

19:42.764 --> 19:44.474
-What?
-I'm kidding,

19:44.558 --> 19:46.185
I'm kidding!
I work, I work.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.644
Thank you.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.272
I want to say "thank you"
to everyone.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.565
From this day forth

19:51.648 --> 19:54.651
I am no longer an Indian
living in America.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.820
I am an Indian-American.

19:56.904 --> 19:57.863
(cheering, applause)

19:57.946 --> 19:59.364
MAN: Here, here, here.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.408
You know, Apu,
in a way,

20:01.491 --> 20:02.784
all Americans
are immigrants,

20:02.868 --> 20:04.328
except Native Americans.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.121
Yeah. Native Americans
like us.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.456
No, I mean
American Indians.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.583
-Like me.
-No, I mean--

20:09.666 --> 20:11.168
-(tapping)
-Hi, everyone!

20:11.251 --> 20:13.170
If I could just say
a few words...

20:13.253 --> 20:15.255
I'd be a better
public speaker.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.174
(laughing)

20:17.257 --> 20:19.676
Now that you're all relaxed--
(clears throat)

20:19.760 --> 20:22.179
most of us here
were born in America.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.723
We take this country
for granted;

20:24.806 --> 20:26.558
but not immigrants like Apu.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.561
While the rest of us are
drinking ourselves stupid,

20:29.645 --> 20:32.648
they're driving the cabs
that get us home safely.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.609
They're writing the operas
that entertain us every day.

20:35.692 --> 20:38.779
They're training our tigers
and kicking our extra points.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.697
These people are the glue

20:40.781 --> 20:44.284
that holds together the gears
of our society.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.913
If we pass Proposition 24,
we'll be losing

20:47.996 --> 20:50.249
some of the truest
Americans of all.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.541
-(cheering)
-MOE: You said it, Homer!

20:51.625 --> 20:53.710
When you go
to the polls tomorrow,

20:53.794 --> 20:57.714
please, vote no
on Proposition 24.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.217
ALL (chanting):
No on 24.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.136
No on 24.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.722
No on 24.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.183
No on 24.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.228
No on 24.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.981
No on 24.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.983
No on 24.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.237
<i>It's a landslide!</i>
<i>Yes on 24.</i>

21:20.320 --> 21:24.950
<i>The Proposition passed</i>
<i>with a record 95%...</i>

21:25.033 --> 21:27.452
When are people going
to learn--

21:27.536 --> 21:29.371
democracy doesn't work.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.873
Please don't knock
the land that I love.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.961
(gasps)
Jury duty!

21:36.044 --> 21:39.840
Oh! Today I am truly
an American citizen.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.008
(sighs)

21:41.091 --> 21:42.217
Oh!

21:44.511 --> 21:46.805
Just thank heaven
everything worked out

21:46.888 --> 21:49.599
for the people
we care about.

21:49.683 --> 21:50.934
