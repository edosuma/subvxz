our conference awaits!

00:40.165 --> 00:41.458
(Barking)

00:42.292 --> 00:43.752
(Whimpers)

00:43.752 --> 00:45.212
(Barking)

00:56.265 --> 00:57.391
Excuse me!

00:57.474 --> 00:58.684
Whoa!

00:59.643 --> 01:01.436
‐ (Barking)
‐ Huh?

01:01.436 --> 01:04.815
‐ Hello, Andy.
‐ Hey, Professor Pascal.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.817
‐ Huh?
‐ (Sighs)

01:07.109 --> 01:09.987
‐ Uh, are you all right?
‐ I'm actually supposed to be

01:09.987 --> 01:13.323
at a museum conference, but
I've been given terrible news.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.325
No dogs allowed!

01:15.325 --> 01:17.869
Well, maybe
I could dog‐sit Asta for you.

01:18.370 --> 01:21.999
Oh! Oh, that's amazing!
Here's her stuff.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.793
Woofkies are her favourite
treat, but no more than two!

01:24.918 --> 01:28.589
And here's her ball to play!
Be good, puppers.

01:28.797 --> 01:32.634
And don't forget to water her
once an hour! Thanks, Andy!

01:32.634 --> 01:34.136
(Barking)

01:34.136 --> 01:37.097
‐ Oh, you want this?
‐ Woof!

01:37.347 --> 01:39.224
Then ya gotta hustle for it!

01:39.600 --> 01:40.475
(Barking)

01:55.032 --> 01:57.034
Oh, look who finally made it.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.744
Wait. Why is Asta with you?

01:59.119 --> 02:01.621
I'm dog‐sitting for
Professor Pascal for the day.

02:06.335 --> 02:09.171
So, how's the ghost
thinga‐ma‐bobber comin' along?

02:09.254 --> 02:11.173
Ms Jones
is almost finished loading

02:11.173 --> 02:13.258
Freezofear's
Boo‐energy signature.

02:13.508 --> 02:17.554
This new version will let us
copy any ghost's power!

02:17.679 --> 02:20.349
(Message comes in)

02:20.349 --> 02:22.392
‐ Uh...
‐ ANDY: What's up?

02:22.392 --> 02:25.896
Nothing, just my dad wants me
to join him in a friendly game

02:26.063 --> 02:28.231
with his fans
to launch some energy drink.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.692
He still doesn't get
basketball's not my thing.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.029
But it is totally mine.
Come on, let's go!

02:34.112 --> 02:36.698
I'm pretty sure taking Asta
to a basketball game

02:36.698 --> 02:38.617
is a recipe for squashed dog.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.414
Aw, come on! Ms Jones could
dog‐sit Asta for a couple hours!

02:44.414 --> 02:45.874
Uh... Mmm‐hmm.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.668
Dude, Professor Pascal

02:47.751 --> 02:49.670
left Asta in your hands!

02:50.671 --> 02:53.882
Chill, he'll be as golden
as a retriever.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.510
Ms Jones, are you sure
you're fine with Asta?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.553
What? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, sure, Liv.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.222
You can do that.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.811
(Cheering)

03:09.439 --> 03:10.565
Yeah!

03:15.278 --> 03:17.614

Michael Collins!

03:26.289 --> 03:27.499
Oh, yeah!

03:27.791 --> 03:30.085
A few words to inspire the fan?

03:30.210 --> 03:34.089
To play basketball, you're gona
need a dose of Dragon Venom!

03:34.214 --> 03:36.049
So, who wants to play?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.847
Got it!

03:42.097 --> 03:43.890
(Chuckles)

03:44.141 --> 03:45.392
(Barking)

03:48.395 --> 03:49.896
(Whimpers)

03:51.982 --> 03:53.817
‐ Woof!
‐ Dog?

03:58.947 --> 04:01.741
‐ (Laughter)
‐ Ah! Ghost!

04:01.825 --> 04:03.410
Dog? Ghost‐Dog?

04:03.410 --> 04:06.037
Aaah! Itchy, itchy, itchy!

04:20.385 --> 04:22.179
(Honking)

04:22.179 --> 04:23.138
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

04:29.644 --> 04:31.646
(Laughter)

04:32.397 --> 04:35.192
Oh, no! This is an emergency!

04:37.027 --> 04:39.863
Go Boo‐cap that ghost, Glowboo!

04:39.988 --> 04:41.448
Roger. Copy.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.541
‐ Yes!
‐ Sweet moves, kid!

04:51.541 --> 04:54.419
I may have found
the best junior player in NYC.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.338
What?

04:56.463 --> 04:59.591
Oh! Oh, wow!

05:00.217 --> 05:04.387
This is like every birthday and
Christmas combined for Andy!

05:04.387 --> 05:07.265
‐ Ms Jones?
‐ Liv!

05:07.265 --> 05:11.019
Some stray mutt got into
the lab and unleashed a ghost!

05:11.144 --> 05:13.772
‐ Asta?
‐ I don't know who Asta is,

05:13.772 --> 05:18.026
but Glowboo's on his way.
Transform as soon as you can!

05:18.235 --> 05:19.569
(Laughter)

05:29.246 --> 05:31.414
‐ Sorry.
‐ (Laughter)

05:31.540 --> 05:33.583
Oh!

05:45.846 --> 05:48.473
‐ (Evil laugh)
‐ Aaah!

05:50.058 --> 05:51.518
Oh, no. We need to move.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.145
Mike! Where are you?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.941
Mike!

06:02.487 --> 06:03.864
‐ Dad!
‐ Oh, no!

06:03.947 --> 06:05.365
Michael Collins just turned

06:05.365 --> 06:07.450
into a furry plush toy?

06:16.126 --> 06:19.087
‐ Sorry about your dad...
‐ You should be. Thanks to you,

06:19.087 --> 06:21.590
‐ Asta woke that ghost!
‐ Mike!

06:21.798 --> 06:24.259
Well, maybe not directly.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.470
Let's play the blame game
after we Boo‐cap this ghost.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.472
Let's go, Ghost Force!

06:30.140 --> 06:32.893
Ghost Force!
Don't fear the glow!

06:38.440 --> 06:39.649
Fury!

06:40.692 --> 06:41.943
Krush!

06:43.403 --> 06:44.821
Myst!

06:47.949 --> 06:49.451
Ghost Force!

06:52.787 --> 06:54.664
Aaah!

06:54.789 --> 06:55.665
Huh?

06:56.124 --> 06:57.167
Ready for action.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.461
Thank you, Ghost Force!

06:59.961 --> 07:02.005
It bristles its fur
to trigger its power!

07:02.297 --> 07:06.468
So we have to block its fur.
Fractal power!

07:08.553 --> 07:09.804
Time to finish it!

07:12.182 --> 07:13.975
Aaah!

07:17.270 --> 07:18.229
Krush!

07:22.525 --> 07:23.818
(Laughs)

07:24.736 --> 07:27.197
‐ We can't let it get away!
‐ Flight mode activated.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.742
All I had to do was dog‐sit,
but instead

07:30.867 --> 07:34.079
I got Krush and his dad
turned into walking mops.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.248
We all make mistakes.
And it's not all your fault.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.669
And we can fix it, starting with
Boo‐capping that ghost!

07:40.669 --> 07:41.836
You're right!

07:47.175 --> 07:48.677
(Evil laugh)

07:54.182 --> 07:55.600
Flexy power!

07:59.688 --> 08:01.564
(Chortles)

08:03.608 --> 08:04.943
Aaah!

08:05.485 --> 08:06.569
Aaah!

08:10.115 --> 08:11.408
(Laughter)

08:11.616 --> 08:13.284
My Flexy Boo's
not strong enough

08:13.284 --> 08:15.870
to capture it!
What do we do?

08:16.079 --> 08:19.249
We require something equivalent
to Krush's power.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.792
Like Freezofear's Boo energy!

08:21.042 --> 08:23.002
Ms Jones loaded it
in the ghost gauntlet.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.921
Aaah!

08:25.880 --> 08:28.383
Ms Jones! We'll need
to borrow the ghost gauntlet.

08:28.591 --> 08:32.303
Ah! Ooh! Ooh!
The gadget's not ready yet,

08:32.387 --> 08:35.306
but I'll do my best.
You kids stall!

08:35.306 --> 08:38.768
‐ We need to gain some time.
‐ Heh, heh! Got an idea!

08:40.562 --> 08:43.106
‐ Heh, heh!
‐ Huh?

08:46.067 --> 08:47.652
Yo, fleabag!

08:51.489 --> 08:52.741
Wanna play ball?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.585
It fell for it,
hook, line and sinker!

09:09.424 --> 09:11.426
You trying out silly pet trick?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.720
Trust me. I'm not
fooling around this time.

09:15.764 --> 09:16.598
Whoa!

09:17.766 --> 09:21.644
‐ Ms Jones, what's your status?
‐ The gauntlet isn't 100% ready.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.355
‐ I need more time!
‐ We can't hold on much longer!

09:24.355 --> 09:27.650
(Sighs) Fine! But there's
no guarantee it'll work.

09:41.331 --> 09:44.125
My Boo energy is almost empty.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.502
Ms Jones, it's now or never!

09:56.304 --> 09:57.138
Done.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.188
The gauntlet
is ready for downloading

10:05.188 --> 10:08.191
‐ into one of your suits.
‐ Right on time!

10:15.615 --> 10:17.700
(Evil laugh)

10:17.700 --> 10:19.160
Yo, magic carpet!

10:20.370 --> 10:22.539
No one touches my sister!

10:33.591 --> 10:35.426
End game, Fleabag!

10:37.470 --> 10:38.847
Octocat!

10:54.320 --> 10:56.531
(Screams)

11:08.501 --> 11:09.669
Oh!

11:14.048 --> 11:15.049
Huh?

11:17.343 --> 11:18.386
Dad...

11:18.803 --> 11:21.389
Told ya!
I'm a natural‐born pet‐sitter.

11:21.389 --> 11:24.475
Huh? Whoa!

11:28.479 --> 11:31.941
Uh, Ms Jones? The ghost gauntlet
just went kablooey.

11:32.442 --> 11:35.111
I guess we're going to need
a "new" new version

11:35.111 --> 11:37.405
of the ghost gauntlet.
Unfortunately,

11:37.405 --> 11:39.616
it's gonna take some time.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.118
Ah, well,
at least the city is safe...

11:42.118 --> 11:45.914
Ooh! And I'm not itchy any more!
Ha! Good job, kids.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.290
Boo‐yah!

11:54.005 --> 11:56.591
(Laughs)
Oh, thanks a million, Andy.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.426
I hope Asta
wasn't too much trouble?

11:58.676 --> 12:00.595
It was like
she wasn't even there.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.639
Yeah, Andy had so much fun

12:02.764 --> 12:06.100
he wants to dog‐sit her
every time you need!

12:06.100 --> 12:09.896
‐ Argh!
‐ What a wonderful idea!

12:17.153 --> 12:21.157
Man, prepping this party
is a total drag!

12:21.157 --> 12:24.160
Oh! But I like the school party!

12:26.079 --> 12:28.081
Yeah? Well, I don't!

12:28.665 --> 12:30.208
Come on.

12:32.627 --> 12:36.589
Check out the venue
for our end‐of‐semester dance!

12:36.673 --> 12:39.717
Wow, you guys
really decked out the library.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.638
Except there's gonna be
no reading here tonight.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.641
Yep, only dancing.
Grab your partner and go!

12:46.933 --> 12:50.311
(Gasps) I totally forgot
to get a date for the dance!

12:50.436 --> 12:52.855
I can't show off my moves
without a partner!

12:52.939 --> 12:55.191
Oh...

12:55.275 --> 12:57.527
Yo, Charlie! Maybe Mike can ‐‐

12:57.652 --> 13:00.238
Uh, sure I'll help you
with those chairs, Andy.

13:04.367 --> 13:08.246
Really? You blew your chance to
ask Charlie out to stack chairs?

13:08.246 --> 13:11.541
Yeah, Mike, it's not like you
already have a dance partner.

13:11.833 --> 13:16.921
Yeah. I mean, sure,
but dancing's not really my jam.

13:19.007 --> 13:22.468
Oh, come on!
Music is everyone's jam!

13:25.096 --> 13:27.515
Just loosen up those limbs.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.851
Er, can we please not do this?

13:30.351 --> 13:31.853
ANDY: Shake your rump‐ah!

13:32.520 --> 13:35.398
I feel like an octopus
with eight left feet.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.067
No way!
You are working it, dude!

13:38.151 --> 13:42.238
Ha! Love your penguin two‐step,
Junior, but here's a pro‐tip,

13:42.238 --> 13:44.907
it's a dance,
not a nature documentary!

13:44.991 --> 13:46.367
(Laughter)

13:46.909 --> 13:49.412
Yo, Drake, tell me.
Is this box

13:49.412 --> 13:51.247
too heavy for your little arms?

13:51.372 --> 13:52.582
(Laughter)

13:52.999 --> 13:55.710
‐ Ha, ha!
‐ Baker...

13:58.671 --> 14:01.049
(Evil laugh)

14:02.550 --> 14:04.052
Aaah! A ghost!

14:07.555 --> 14:09.640
Bobby, help me!

14:09.640 --> 14:11.768
Oh, no! My teeth!

14:22.236 --> 14:24.113
Hi, Ms Jones. We've got troubl!

14:24.113 --> 14:27.784
Oh, hello, Liv,
I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.287
‐ You OK, Ms Jones?
‐ I'm zen! What's up?

14:32.038 --> 14:34.290
A ghost just crashed
our dance party!

14:34.290 --> 14:36.751
‐ Ghost on the move!
‐ Aaah! Aaah!

14:38.836 --> 14:40.588
I'll send you Glowboo ASAP.

14:41.005 --> 14:44.092
Hmm. I've never encountered
this one before.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.594
You'd better capture it
or who knows what it could do.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.264
Let's go, Ghost Force!

14:51.140 --> 14:53.684
Ghost Force!
Don't fear the glow!

14:59.315 --> 15:00.483
Fury!

15:01.567 --> 15:02.819
Krush!

15:03.986 --> 15:05.321
Myst!

15:08.991 --> 15:10.409
Ghost Force!

15:13.412 --> 15:14.914
(Laughter)

15:14.914 --> 15:16.332
(Music playing)

15:21.420 --> 15:22.547
Ah!

15:31.806 --> 15:32.723
Aaah!

15:33.933 --> 15:35.434
(Laughter)

15:39.105 --> 15:40.857
What the... ?

15:52.368 --> 15:55.538
‐ Oh, no!
‐ It merged with a boom box!

15:55.621 --> 15:59.876
Who knew ghosts were
into hip‐hop? Or rather Creepop?

16:00.168 --> 16:02.086
Oh!
It's forcing people to dance?

16:02.879 --> 16:04.505
Oh, great.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.508
Spectral arrow!

16:10.845 --> 16:12.722
Well, at least we know
your arrows

16:12.847 --> 16:14.098
won't work on its bubbles.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.892
(Screaming)

16:16.017 --> 16:17.435
Sounds like this dance party

16:17.435 --> 16:20.313
is going city‐wide. Let's move!

16:25.484 --> 16:27.570
This is Charlie reporting live

16:27.570 --> 16:30.573
as the Ghost Force
flies off to save the city!

16:41.209 --> 16:42.835
(Evil laugh)

16:48.841 --> 16:52.261
Funky. I'd almost ask it
to DJ at our dance

16:52.386 --> 16:55.097
‐ if it weren't so evil.
‐ This is not good.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.059
It's making the whole city
dance like crazy!

16:58.059 --> 16:59.060
Wait.

17:02.313 --> 17:05.274
Neutralising its cable
might cut off its power.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.985
Ha! I can get down with that!

17:07.985 --> 17:09.987
I don't like
where this is going.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.865
Go, go, go, Ghost Force!

17:13.366 --> 17:17.703
Charlie? Oh, no! Not now!

17:18.204 --> 17:20.831
‐ Ready, Fury?
‐ I was born ready!

17:28.589 --> 17:30.132
Thanks for the assist, sis!

17:30.132 --> 17:32.593
And today was the day
the music died.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.514
Heads up!

17:43.688 --> 17:45.898
Save me a spot
on your dance card!

17:54.782 --> 17:56.200
(Evil laugh)

17:56.492 --> 17:59.203
Or I'll just sit this track out.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.208
Yeesh, you're unstoppable!

18:09.839 --> 18:11.340
Yeah!

18:12.633 --> 18:15.177
The speakers!
That's what feeds its power!

18:15.469 --> 18:17.847
So let's use
some power of our own.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.017
Aaah!

18:24.312 --> 18:26.022
Krush, give us a beat!

18:26.147 --> 18:27.857
KRUSH: Not gonna happen.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.318
What if I get hit
in front of Charlie?

18:33.738 --> 18:38.034
Charlie? OK, I get it.
You got a major crush, Krush.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.704
But we really need you
to bring some bass to its face!

18:42.538 --> 18:45.207
Allow me to get down
with your bad self.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.344
‐ Hey!
‐ Sorry!

18:56.344 --> 18:58.888
‐ Gotta get you to safety!
‐ Krush?

18:59.013 --> 19:02.016
‐ Look out, behind you!
‐ Oh, great!

19:07.980 --> 19:09.899
Aaah!

19:17.114 --> 19:20.409
Oh! Aaah! Aaah!

19:20.951 --> 19:22.745
Aaah!

19:25.539 --> 19:27.375
Oh... Hello!

19:28.084 --> 19:29.835
Yeah!

19:52.108 --> 19:53.693
Can't keep a beat?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.742
‐ That was close!
‐ Yeah...

20:01.951 --> 20:04.995
Uh, sorry about
the ridiculous acrobatics.

20:05.121 --> 20:09.125
‐ Hope you didn't get seasick.
‐ Ridiculous? Are you kidding?

20:09.250 --> 20:11.877
Where'd you learn those steps?
That was super cool.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.422
Really? Ahem!

20:14.547 --> 20:16.424
I mean, cool.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.010
Anyway,
gotta go help my Boo‐buds.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.019
(Evil laugh)

20:29.270 --> 20:31.188
Guys, watch out!

20:36.026 --> 20:37.987
‐ (Laughs)
‐ Fractal power!

20:41.490 --> 20:42.783
Krush!

20:42.867 --> 20:45.035
I'm getting tired
of your playlist!

20:52.209 --> 20:53.085
Gotcha!

20:56.922 --> 20:58.716
Roar!

20:58.966 --> 21:01.469
‐ Ah!
‐ (Evil laugh)

21:11.687 --> 21:13.481
Can't keep this up alone!

21:17.693 --> 21:18.402
I got this!

21:20.696 --> 21:23.032
Leave that
walking jukebox to me!

21:26.035 --> 21:28.204
Your dancing days are over!

21:32.291 --> 21:34.460
OK, it doesn't matter
how I look...

21:34.460 --> 21:37.129
I have to get out
of my own head and just do it.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.965
Huh?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.928
Work it, Krush!

22:02.112 --> 22:03.739
The rhythm always gets you!

22:09.620 --> 22:11.038
Yeah! Finally!

22:13.624 --> 22:15.209
Gromax!

22:47.116 --> 22:48.742
Woohoo!

22:48.993 --> 22:51.370
(Cheering)

22:53.789 --> 22:56.750
(Applause)

22:57.001 --> 22:58.085
Boo‐yah!

22:58.544 --> 22:59.670
Boo‐yah!

23:00.254 --> 23:03.465
Boo‐yah, kids! Whoa! Oh!

23:03.465 --> 23:06.093
Finally free
from that stupid pose!

23:06.093 --> 23:10.639
Phew! That is the last time I do
yoga without a workout buddy!

23:21.191 --> 23:23.319
I caught the whole thing
on camera!

23:23.444 --> 23:26.697
You shoulda seen it,
the Ghost Force in action,

23:26.697 --> 23:29.658
not to mention Krush's
super‐slick moves!

23:29.658 --> 23:31.827
Hey, girls, look at Mike!

23:35.247 --> 23:38.000
He's a kind of
a skilled dancer!

23:38.083 --> 23:40.336
Yeah! He's awesome!

23:42.922 --> 23:46.467
You know, you kinda dance
like Krush. I love it!

23:46.550 --> 23:50.012
Oh, thanks!
You're pretty good too!
