00:11.170 --> 00:14.280
It's always good to have you at the park, Mr. Maellard, sir.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.370
Don't try to fantisize with me, Bert!

00:16.410 --> 00:18.370
Actually, sir, my name is Benson.

00:18.370 --> 00:20.550
I know what your name is, Beanbag!

00:20.590 --> 00:23.640
So, everything is ready for the unveiling of the new statue today, right,

00:23.640 --> 00:24.670
Beanbag?

00:24.670 --> 00:26.860
Yes, sir. The catering's all set up,

00:26.860 --> 00:28.770
and the sound system is in place...

00:28.770 --> 00:32.659
Good. Great. Only one thing missing. My son! Pops!

00:32.870 --> 00:35.770
When I told him he had to give a speech today, he ran away, crying!

00:35.770 --> 00:38.320
I did not invite all my friends and waste a lot of money for nothing!

00:38.320 --> 00:39.750
Right, Beanteen?

00:39.750 --> 00:40.670
Uh, no, sir.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.960
Now go find Pops so he can give his speech,

00:42.960 --> 00:45.280
or you're fired! Underline, fired!

00:46.270 --> 00:48.350
So, what do we do first?

00:48.350 --> 00:52.020
Find Pops, and make sure Mordecai and Rigby don't mess this up.

00:55.370 --> 00:57.790
Hey Pops, is everything okay?

00:57.930 --> 00:58.960
No.

00:59.150 --> 01:03.310
My father wants me to give a speech in front of all his friends today.

01:03.310 --> 01:04.590
But I can't,

01:04.739 --> 01:06.310
because I'm a no-good turkey

01:06.310 --> 01:09.410
and I'm going to strawberry jam the whole thing up!

01:10.320 --> 01:11.390
What are you saying?

01:11.390 --> 01:13.620
I'm just saying, I can't!

01:13.640 --> 01:17.910
I don't know why, I just get terribly anxious when I give speeches!

01:17.930 --> 01:20.810
I give speeches all the time. It's easy.

01:20.850 --> 01:22.900
When do you ever give speeches?

01:22.900 --> 01:25.700
What? It's like, just, talking in front of a bunch of people!

01:25.730 --> 01:27.650
We talk in front of each other all the time.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.650
Actually, yeah! We do do that!

01:29.710 --> 01:32.260
See, Pops? We can totally help you get over your nerves.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.200
Oh, thank you!

01:35.130 --> 01:36.060
Okay, Pops.

01:36.070 --> 01:37.940
I want you to pretend there's a crowd of people here.

01:37.940 --> 01:39.950
But, they're all your family and friends.

01:39.950 --> 01:41.950
You know, people who it's easy for you to talk to.

01:41.950 --> 01:43.470
And... go!

01:44.770 --> 01:46.620
I need my notes.

01:46.890 --> 01:47.930
Let's see.

01:49.330 --> 01:51.140
Where did everyone go?

01:51.470 --> 01:53.840
They must have hated my speech.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.660
No, Pops. Just pretend there are people there.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.870
I'm not very good at pretending.

01:59.870 --> 02:00.830
I got this.

02:02.080 --> 02:02.830
Here.

02:02.860 --> 02:05.970
Pretend these dudes are your friends and family in the crowd.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.740
Where did these people come from?

02:07.770 --> 02:09.310
Okay, Pops. Give it a shot.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.740
Okay...

02:12.380 --> 02:15.130
NO! NO! Get away!

02:16.400 --> 02:18.480
STOP FOLLOWING ME!

02:20.360 --> 02:23.180
Maybe we should just find you some real people to practice on.

02:32.060 --> 02:34.840
Okay. Obviously, this isn't working.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.790
I guess Pops will just never be able to give his speech,

02:36.790 --> 02:37.800
you know what I'm saying?

02:39.120 --> 02:40.710
How you holding up there, Pops?

02:41.780 --> 02:44.140
I just don't think I can do it.

02:44.140 --> 02:44.980
Hey, I know!

02:44.990 --> 02:46.840
Why don't you just picture everybody naked?

02:46.840 --> 02:48.530
- Naked? - Yeah!

02:48.530 --> 02:49.720
Okay.

02:51.180 --> 02:53.780
I don't like doing this!

02:53.860 --> 02:56.890
Ugh. I don't know, why don't you just spin around and get dizzy or something?

02:56.890 --> 02:58.810
What? How's that gonna do anything?

02:58.810 --> 03:01.140
It makes more sense than looking at naked people!

03:01.140 --> 03:02.450
Pops, what would you rather do?

03:02.450 --> 03:04.600
Spin around and get dizzy, or look at naked people?

03:04.600 --> 03:05.760
Get dizzy.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.720
Why don't you give it a try, Pops?

03:09.270 --> 03:10.860
Okay.

03:11.110 --> 03:12.970
- Ready? - Uh-huh.

03:13.070 --> 03:14.290
Now spin!

03:16.780 --> 03:18.240
Oh, yes!

03:18.360 --> 03:19.500
Is it working?

03:19.500 --> 03:22.790
Oh my, it's true!

03:22.800 --> 03:24.700
I am not nervous anymore!

03:24.880 --> 03:28.570
It is workin, iti s workin!

03:28.620 --> 03:35.950
I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous!

03:36.690 --> 03:38.140
I'm gonna do it!

03:38.140 --> 03:41.620
I'm gonna give the best speech I've ever given!

03:42.430 --> 03:44.460
I cannot find Pops! Did you see him?

03:44.460 --> 03:46.430
Nope I checked everywhere!

03:46.570 --> 03:49.360
Muscle Man, have you seen Pops at all today?

03:49.360 --> 03:52.960
Yeah! And you know who else has seen Pops today?

03:53.020 --> 03:54.530
Who, your mom?

03:54.590 --> 03:56.170
I was not gonna say that!

03:56.170 --> 03:59.430
Why does everyone always think I'm gonna say "my mom"?

03:59.510 --> 04:03.470
I saw Pops earlier by the playground, with those two losers.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.330
Oh great. Mordecai and Rigby found him first.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.240
We better find him, quick!

04:09.660 --> 04:11.810
Okay Pops, you can stop now.

04:11.810 --> 04:15.330
But I have to keep spinning until I give my speech!

04:15.370 --> 04:17.620
Did I tell you Iam not nervous anymore?

04:17.660 --> 04:20.209
- Yeah, you did. - A bunch of times, actually.

04:20.209 --> 04:23.680
Isn't it wonderful? I think I'm finally ready!

04:24.320 --> 04:25.590
Careful, Pops!

05:00.740 --> 05:01.700
Is he dead?

05:04.030 --> 05:06.930
Oh dude! He must have passed out from spinning too much!

05:06.980 --> 05:10.120
Never pass out, when there's markers about!

05:10.120 --> 05:12.990
Dude! This isn't some sleepover, this is serious!

05:15.200 --> 05:16.930
Oh man! I'm gonna get help.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.490
You stay with Pops!

05:38.010 --> 05:39.150
Sorry about that.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.860
Traveller Iam The Iacedrom.

05:40.860 --> 05:42.290
And I, Ybgir.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.780
Would you like some ice cream?

05:44.780 --> 05:46.370
Oh yes, of course!

05:46.570 --> 05:48.890
What brings you here, traveller?

05:49.640 --> 05:53.250
Well, I was just getting over my fear of giving speeches.

05:55.370 --> 05:57.810
Indeed! We all hate speeches!

05:57.860 --> 05:59.870
In fact, we outlawed them.

05:59.930 --> 06:01.390
Yes, yes. Quite illegal.

06:01.390 --> 06:03.390
In here, it is forbidden to give speeches

06:03.390 --> 06:05.710
just as it is forbidden not to enjoy ice cream.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.600
Oh, what a relief!

06:07.670 --> 06:11.050
- Good show! - Jolly good show indeed!

06:14.260 --> 06:16.750
Oh no, what are you doin?! Get away from him!

06:18.710 --> 06:19.570
Rigby!

06:19.640 --> 06:21.490
Sorry, it's a nervous habit!

06:21.510 --> 06:22.830
You guys were takin forever.

06:22.930 --> 06:25.460
That is a disaster! Just Look at him!

06:27.640 --> 06:30.230
It's not funny! Skips, what do we do?

06:32.480 --> 06:35.400
You shouldn't have made him spin like that.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.780
You're gonna have to go in after him.

06:38.780 --> 06:39.810
Go in where?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.980
Into Pops.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.160
Make this quick. I don't want people to think we're holding hands or something.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.360
Just spin!

06:56.960 --> 06:59.410
Don't worry Pops, we're comin! for you

07:08.160 --> 07:09.640
Look, there's Pops!

07:09.640 --> 07:11.790
Pops, Pops!

07:11.820 --> 07:14.500
Mordecai, Rigby, hello!

07:14.600 --> 07:16.570
Pops, we have come to bring you back!

07:16.630 --> 07:19.670
But I don't want to come back. I like it here.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.120
But what about your speech?

07:21.120 --> 07:23.060
I don't want to give the speech.

07:23.130 --> 07:25.070
But we spent all that time preparin,

07:25.070 --> 07:26.820
are you just gonna blow it off now?!

07:26.820 --> 07:27.670
Yes!

07:27.850 --> 07:29.190
That is ridiculous!

07:29.190 --> 07:31.990
Come on Pops, let's go! You are comin back with us!

07:32.070 --> 07:33.740
No, I'm not!

07:33.740 --> 07:36.630
- Pops, let's go. - I said no!

07:37.020 --> 07:38.260
Now listen here,

07:38.260 --> 07:42.010
I Have gone through enough turmoil because of that confounded speech.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.210
Why is it me that needs to speak?

07:44.210 --> 07:46.920
Surely, there are those more qualified than I!

07:46.920 --> 07:49.110
I hate speaking in front of crowds.

07:49.110 --> 07:51.530
And we have tried every which way for it to work,

07:51.530 --> 07:54.230
but I just simply cannot do it.

07:54.230 --> 07:56.490
Why am I like that? I don't know,

07:56.490 --> 07:58.930
but surely my father must understand

07:58.930 --> 08:00.750
that there are limits to my abilities.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.670
I Will never ever be able to give a speech,

08:02.670 --> 08:04.670
again and that's just fine by me!

08:06.600 --> 08:08.600
Never say never, Pops!

08:08.620 --> 08:09.740
What do you mean?

08:09.740 --> 08:11.150
You just gave a speech!

08:11.870 --> 08:15.230
Oh my, I did! I did give a speech!

08:15.320 --> 08:18.860
Yeah! I guess you did not get nervous because you were not facing the crowd!

08:18.860 --> 08:21.390
It's true, I didn't feel nervous at all.

08:21.430 --> 08:24.200
Friends, I'm sorry, but I have to leave you now.

08:24.310 --> 08:26.300
Indeed! You do have to leave,

08:26.310 --> 08:28.090
for you have broken the law!

08:28.170 --> 08:29.590
No speeches!

08:36.740 --> 08:40.110
Pops! Skips, drop us lower!

08:40.950 --> 08:42.270
More, Skips!

08:42.270 --> 08:43.840
That's all we got!

08:52.580 --> 08:53.500
Pops!

08:53.600 --> 08:55.220
Skips, pull us up!

09:06.590 --> 09:07.590
Pops, you're awake!

09:07.590 --> 09:09.320
Benson, my good man!

09:09.320 --> 09:13.560
Pardon me, I just came back from that strange and wonderful place.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.180
Okay, sure, but can you still give the speech?

09:16.310 --> 09:18.760
Oh yes, Iam finally prepared!

09:18.780 --> 09:19.950
Thank goodness.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.240
We just have to get this trash off his face.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.470
Nah, it's cool.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.120
Pops is gonna give his speech facing backwards anyway so...

09:26.120 --> 09:28.860
What?! You idiots, that is not some kind of joke!

09:28.860 --> 09:30.530
He cannot give a major speech

09:30.530 --> 09:33.680
in front of a distinguished crowd facing backwards!

09:33.780 --> 09:36.630
If Mr. Maellard sees that, we are all gonna get fired!

09:36.690 --> 09:37.650
Give me the marker.

09:38.830 --> 09:40.190
Turn around, Pops.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.400
We're dead.

09:55.230 --> 09:57.060
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:57.070 --> 10:01.110
I hearby dedicate this new statue to the Park.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.030
Bravo. Bravo.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.960
That's the whole speech?!

10:04.960 --> 10:07.240
You have got a fine boy there, Maellard.

10:13.550 --> 10:15.010
That went pretty well.

10:15.190 --> 10:16.330
Are you kidding?!

10:16.370 --> 10:18.610
You can't fire me, I thought of the marker thing.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.670
Yeah, we totally saved you this time, Benson.

10:21.740 --> 10:23.180
Quick, Mr Maellard's coming!

10:24.530 --> 10:28.260
Son, you gave a fine speech out there. I am so...

10:28.520 --> 10:29.610
very proud of you.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.110
Oh! Thank you, papa!

10:32.250 --> 10:33.160
Thank you.

10:33.220 --> 10:35.710
You pulled it together out there, Ballbucket.

10:35.740 --> 10:36.470
Good job.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.180
Thank you, sir. It was....

10:38.780 --> 10:39.890
no trouble.

10:40.980 --> 10:43.640
What was that? We're the ones that found Pops!

10:43.640 --> 10:46.830
And sent him to shock and desecrated his face!

10:48.040 --> 10:49.480
Let's go clean you up, Pops.

10:52.290 --> 10:53.900
That party sucks.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.650
You wanna go back to that Dizzy World?

10:55.650 --> 10:56.610
Yes.
