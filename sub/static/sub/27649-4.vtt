THOMAS: CT scan indicates
he's a white male,

00:07.680 --> 00:10.560
approximately 40 years old. Injuries
were multiple. Blast and burns.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.000
He resembles a bomb victim.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
ASHTON: So he was close
to the seat of the blast?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.280
Which is consistent with
him making methamphetamine.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.960
ASHTON: Second victim?
Darren Jameson. NIKKI: Age?

00:18.960 --> 00:20.240
15 years old.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.000
So sad. Young person. Potential.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.560
JACK: You didn't want to tell him
his student was a drug dealer?

00:24.560 --> 00:26.960
I don't want to leap to conclusions.
It's not much of a leap.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.400
If I have nothing to sell,
they're gonna go somewhere else.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.960
I've got spice I need to get rid of.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.040
Sell it to the meth-heads.
They will get more.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.360
Please help her.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.920
Who is it? My mother.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.640
Oh, God.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.280
RAMUSH: You need to work more
with the blacks. Get a crew.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.080
Let them run for you, sell for you.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.440
Do you want to make some money?
How good, blud?

00:44.440 --> 00:48.120
Dance fever. They've got to have it.
Blows your head off.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.160
GRACE: Who's that boy?
JESSE: No-one.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.600
Well, Faith seems to like him.
She needs to stay away from him.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.240
She doesn't want to get involved
in all that. Involved in what?

00:55.240 --> 00:56.680
You want to give this to them?!

00:56.680 --> 00:58.960
Why would you just squander
your own opportunities?!

00:58.960 --> 01:00.680
Just...and you're gone.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.160
St Hugh's?

01:02.160 --> 01:04.040
A St Hugh's woman?

01:04.040 --> 01:05.360
I am so proud.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.000
So proud of you!

01:11.640 --> 01:13.880
Babe? Come on, babe, wake up.
What's wrong with her?

01:13.880 --> 01:15.520
Hey! Come, come, come.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.280
Hello?

NIKKI: The exact amount of
a narcotic that constitutes

02:52.000 --> 02:55.760
a lethal dose will vary depending
on age, size and weight.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.200
Individuals who are hypersensitive
to opiate drugs

03:03.200 --> 03:05.440
may experience lethal effects
from low amounts.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.440
Individuals who have
developed tolerance

03:07.440 --> 03:10.520
may experience lethal effects
from extremely high amounts.

03:15.360 --> 03:20.440
The lethal dose for heroin is
generally between 75 and 375mg.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.200
Let me see that.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.360

03:32.360 --> 03:34.440
NIKKI: A lethal dose of morphine
for an average

03:34.440 --> 03:37.120
healthy person is 200mg.

03:43.640 --> 03:47.520
And for fentanyl, the drug
found in Faith Taylor's blood,

03:47.520 --> 03:50.600
the lethal dose is 2mg.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.000
To put it in perspective,
the average paracetamol is 500mg.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.040
Divide that into 250 pieces,
and one of them would kill you.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.560
Concentration in her blood?

04:01.560 --> 04:03.120
NIKKI: 3mg.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.960
It can be unpredictable and lethal.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.360
Cause of death?

04:07.360 --> 04:09.880
Hypoxic brain injury
from respiratory depression,

04:09.880 --> 04:12.040
induced by opioid toxicity.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.680
Her respiratory system slowed down

04:15.680 --> 04:17.120
until it stopped.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.600
Do you have any witnesses?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.360
Uh-uh.
LIN: Is there a crime here?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.160
Other than terminal stupidity?

04:22.160 --> 04:26.520
Did she take pills? Did she inject
it? How were the drugs delivered?

04:26.520 --> 04:27.840
No needle marks.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.400
Nothing in the contents
of her stomach

04:29.400 --> 04:30.720
that suggests she ingested it.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.080
She didn't vomit at the scene?

04:33.080 --> 04:35.640
She did this to herself.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.800
Sometimes people need
to be protected from themselves.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.440
They need to take responsibility
for themselves. William...

04:41.440 --> 04:43.960
If she knowingly and willingly
took the drug,

04:43.960 --> 04:45.800
what can we do?
Hold on, we don't know...

04:45.800 --> 04:49.080
Faith Taylor is a tragedy,
but she did this to herself.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.760
We don't know that.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.720
This is a suspicious death.
We'll treat it as a possible murder

04:55.720 --> 04:58.360
until the investigation
proves otherwise.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.800
Of course we will.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.320
What did you do, bruv?

05:09.320 --> 05:11.560
Nothing. Nothing?

05:11.560 --> 05:14.200
The ho's dead, bruv.
Don't call her that!

05:14.200 --> 05:16.360
Hey, hey, relax!
The police are all round you.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.280
Now I don't want them round mine.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.400
Hey, you, man.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.760
It's mental what happened, yeah?
Really sorry.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.920
Anyone asking questions,
you don't say nothing.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.600
What am I gonna say?

05:40.640 --> 05:44.280
That's attitude.
I don't want no attitude.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.600
I need to worry about him?
No, he's calm.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.280
I got some baggies, yeah? Easy.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.280
Sell 'em at schools.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.200
Did you know your daughter
used drugs?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.760
She didn't use drugs.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.480
Do you know who she was with?

06:11.520 --> 06:15.360
Girlfriends. Good girls...
from college.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.120
Erm, there may have been others.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.240
Do you have any idea who may
have supplied the drugs to her?

06:21.240 --> 06:25.800
She didn't do drugs,
so, no, we wouldn't have any idea.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.400
Darren Jameson's mother didn't
realise her son was a drug dealer.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.880
Darren Jameson sold drugs?

06:35.880 --> 06:37.440
And that's the problem.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.520
You can't always tell by looking.
Book and cover, and all that.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.000
May I look in Faith's room, please?

07:08.560 --> 07:09.760
I can't.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.840
There. Thank you.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.920
Does your son take drugs, Mr Taylor?

07:26.920 --> 07:28.880
No. Really?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.840
He's 16.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.360
You sure about that?

07:32.360 --> 07:35.480
What has this got to do
with my daughter's death?

07:35.480 --> 07:38.520
I'm just looking at the victim's
lifestyle and her access to drugs.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.360
She is not a victim.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.520
Sorry. You're right.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.320
I shouldn't have said victim.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.240
Guys, go to your next lesson.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.720
Sir?

08:02.720 --> 08:04.360
Mr Taylor?

08:04.360 --> 08:07.120
Are you OK? I want this cleared up.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.720
Please.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.560
So you went outside? Yeah.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.480
Faith was with you?

08:21.480 --> 08:23.040
Yeah.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.480
We shared a ciggie.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.160
Glen came out looking for her.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.400
Glen? A guy that liked her.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.640
She was talking with some other guy.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.720
And then she just collapsed,
like... So, who is he?

08:38.160 --> 08:39.760
I don't know him.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.280
What did he look like?

08:42.280 --> 08:46.280
White guy. Hair kind of...
scraped back.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.080
I think he had tats.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.760
Are you sure? I don't remember that.

08:51.760 --> 08:56.840
Literally saw him for, like, two
seconds. He was just hanging around.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.560
Would it be OK if we took
a strand of your hair?

08:59.560 --> 09:01.720
Each of you? Why?

09:01.720 --> 09:03.600
It's a standard test for drug use.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.400
I've smoked weed.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.960
Marijuana?

09:11.040 --> 09:12.800
Skunk.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.440
Any other drugs?

09:18.320 --> 09:19.800
Cocaine.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.600
Just a little.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.880
E.

09:26.920 --> 09:30.360
Everybody uses something.
It's not a big deal.

09:30.360 --> 09:31.760
Unless you die.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.840
Did you give Faith any drugs?
No!

09:35.840 --> 09:38.360
Where do you get the drugs from?
Guys.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.280
We don't buy it.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.560
We'll need to look in your lockers.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.040
You didn't take my calls?

09:59.040 --> 10:00.800
Yeah, no, I was in the
middle of something.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.240
I meant to call you back.
Sorry. Jack... Hmm?

10:05.160 --> 10:06.920
Let me make this easy for you.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.160
I want to sleep with you.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.080
I'm not looking for anything else.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.560
OK.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.880
Good talk. We're just coming.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.920
Where did she get the drugs?

10:49.360 --> 10:50.800
I don't know.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You wouldn't lie to me? No.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.640
Had she done drugs before?

11:04.640 --> 11:07.640
I don't know.
No, I don't think so.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.720
Someone gave them to her?

11:14.560 --> 11:15.920
I guess.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.400
I wasn't there.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.040
I came home.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.440
I wish I hadn't, but...

11:26.560 --> 11:28.880
..I came home. Come here.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.800
It's OK. It's OK.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.120
Why did you come home?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.680
She wanted to go with this guy.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.880
I didn't want to be around it.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.920
What guy?

11:56.400 --> 11:58.000
Jess?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.360
Police! Police! Glen? Glen!

12:10.240 --> 12:11.560
Clear.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.000
ASHTON: Jack?

13:01.720 --> 13:02.920
Yeah?

13:05.080 --> 13:07.640
Not exactly house-proud, is he?
No.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.120
Anything?

13:09.120 --> 13:11.560
No fentanyl or any drugs downstairs.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.360
What do you think this is?

13:21.320 --> 13:22.600
What are you doing?

13:23.960 --> 13:25.600
Well, no-one's going to come in.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.880
I could report you.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.920
Report me?

13:33.920 --> 13:37.120
It was just a bit of fun.
I thought you were interested.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.000
SCOFFS

13:40.000 --> 13:42.720
Who do you think
they're going to believe, Jack -

13:42.720 --> 13:45.880
me or you, after I file
a sexual harassment claim?

13:45.880 --> 13:47.840
What? You're joking?

13:49.520 --> 13:51.160
I'm done with this.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.480
JACK GASPS

13:59.480 --> 14:01.520
ASHTON GASPS

14:01.520 --> 14:02.800
Ashton?

14:04.480 --> 14:06.680
You OK? Yeah.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.360
SHOUTING DOWNSTAIRS

14:09.360 --> 14:11.040
Shit.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.320
ECHOING: Man down!

14:19.520 --> 14:21.320
ECHOING: Someone call a paramedic!

14:23.080 --> 14:24.760
Put pressure on the wound.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.200
He's gone out the window.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.840
We went to arrest Glen Cole,
but we were unable to detain him.

14:37.880 --> 14:41.760
We are doing our best to find him,
but I wanted to let you know.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.440
Do you think he's the one
who gave Faith the drugs?

14:44.440 --> 14:46.560
That murdered her?

14:46.560 --> 14:49.440
We did not find fentanyl
or any other opioid in the flat.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.520
We need to find evidence that shows
Faith did not make a free choice

14:53.520 --> 14:55.160
to take the drug.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.040
That wasn't a free choice.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.400
I know it wasn't.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.120
The drug dealer that provided
the illegal substance can't,

15:01.120 --> 15:04.080
according to the law as it stands,
be charged with murder.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.360
Criminal law accepts
that there is free will.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.200
Informed adults who are deemed
to be of sound mind

15:11.200 --> 15:13.840
are free to make their own choices.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.080
We want to get the drug dealers
off the street.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.880
The law doesn't make it easy.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.600
If we can prove who sold it to her,

15:24.600 --> 15:28.480
we might be able to ask the CPS
to look at involuntary manslaughter.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.480
Proving it is very, very difficult.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.320
I don't want to get your hopes up.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.960
I have no hopes to raise.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.520
What do feds want with me?
Who would snitch you up?

15:42.520 --> 15:44.520
Think about it, blud.
Who would know to tell 'em?

15:44.520 --> 15:46.920
I didn't do nothing.
You stabbed one of them, bruv.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.640
They not letting that go.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.200
What do I do?
What were you thinking, bruv?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.040
I was charged up.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.840
You gotta leave the ends, man.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.880
Where am I gonna go?
How much money you got?

16:28.960 --> 16:30.080
Clarissa!

16:32.040 --> 16:33.880
You're alive? Yeah.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.720
Of course I'm alive.
In hospital.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.120
If I wasn't alive, I'd be, you know,
at work.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.200
You're OK?

16:46.200 --> 16:48.680
Yeah. Walked into a knife.
Not smart.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.520
Thank God you're OK.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.920
Clarissa...

16:57.840 --> 16:59.120
Come here.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.560
Ow!

17:05.560 --> 17:07.280
SHE GASPS
Joking!

17:09.600 --> 17:11.320
Thanks. Thanks, bye.

17:11.320 --> 17:13.920
Pfft! Apparently he's OK.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.920
Flesh wound only.
No internal injuries.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.000
He refused to be admitted.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.080
He didn't want to take a bed.
LAUGHS

17:22.080 --> 17:23.440
Ah.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.360
That's Faith Taylor's mother.

17:26.360 --> 17:28.960
Wants to speak to the doctor
who did her daughter's postmortem.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.760
I can do it if you're busy.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.200
No. I've got it.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.200
Mrs Taylor? Yeah.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.080
Thank you for seeing me.

17:56.920 --> 17:59.400
My daughter didn't use drugs.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.840
And I need to know how
those drugs got into her system.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.080
Do you know?

18:05.880 --> 18:07.720
Not yet. Will you ever know?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.800
If it were your daughter,

18:12.800 --> 18:15.840
and you thought her behaviour
was out of character,

18:15.840 --> 18:17.480
if...

18:21.880 --> 18:23.760
If all of this...

18:24.760 --> 18:26.120
..you couldn't explain...

18:27.600 --> 18:29.440
..would you want to know?

18:30.960 --> 18:32.480
Yes.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.760
When it was someone else's daughter,
I used to think to myself,

18:36.760 --> 18:38.640
"How did their mother
allow that to happen?

18:38.640 --> 18:40.240
"Where was their father?

18:40.240 --> 18:42.440
"Why didn't anyone protect them?"

18:44.560 --> 18:46.920
But the only question I have now...

18:51.800 --> 18:53.480
..how did I fail her?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.720
Think of her as your daughter.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.160
Please.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.040
Help me understand.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.920
I found a high concentration
of fentanyl

19:25.920 --> 19:27.880
in the mucous membrane of the mouth.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.840
I thought it was likely to
have been delivered by

19:29.840 --> 19:31.760
transdermal fentanyl patch,

19:31.760 --> 19:35.440
but there was an even higher
concentration in the nasal passage.

19:35.440 --> 19:40.040
Results from the hair sample show
Faith wasn't a habitual drug user.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.840
There's nicotine in the blood.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.320
Signs to suggest she was
a light smoker.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.040
Lungs show some deposit.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.880
Her cilia are largely intact.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.040
She inhaled the fentanyl.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.960
Do you think she knew
what she was smoking?

19:54.960 --> 19:56.480
No.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.080
But how can we be certain?

20:00.040 --> 20:01.280
I can't prove it.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.800
Clarissa?

20:15.880 --> 20:17.440
He could have died.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.160
He didn't.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.600
Yeah, well, they didn't even
catch the guy who did it,

20:23.600 --> 20:25.440
didn't even recover the knife.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.480
Steady.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.920
Here.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.840
Faith Taylor.

20:35.840 --> 20:39.640
Erm, drugs overdose. Fentanyl.
Right.

20:39.640 --> 20:43.720
Did you recover any cigarette butts
from the area where she collapsed?

20:43.720 --> 20:45.160
Yes.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.280
It's possible the fentanyl
was delivered by a cigarette,

20:56.280 --> 20:58.360
so if we can find a trace...

21:02.440 --> 21:03.640
Thanks.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.960
I've found something!

21:47.400 --> 21:48.520
Huh.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.960
Test the powder?

21:51.960 --> 21:54.400
I'll see if we can get
DNA from the filter.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.360
See if Faith was smoking it.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.080
Good.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.480
GASPS

22:39.360 --> 22:41.120
All right?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.720
Are you OK? Fine.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.320
She's the... Yes.

22:50.680 --> 22:54.120
We didn't help her, did we?
Think you could have?

22:54.120 --> 22:56.560
Why would I do this job if I didn't?

23:09.720 --> 23:12.000
Are you sure you should be here?
Yeah.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.240
ASHTON: I thought you were going
to interview her.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.480
I tried to interview her.
She wouldn't co-operate.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.920
You weren't expecting me
to babysit her, were you?

23:22.160 --> 23:23.760
Hold on.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.400
Don't walk yet.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.680
Something's not right.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.360
Looking at it, can't see it.
Something's not right.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.560
Shoes are on the wrong feet.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.720
Heel's loose. She wouldn't be able
to stand on that.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.360
Nah. She didn't walk here.
Someone put her here.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Scratches moving downwards.
Yes.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.320
A struggle?

24:58.040 --> 25:00.760
THOMAS: A ligature was used
to strangle her.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.720
Fingernail marks and accompanying
abrasions of the skin

25:03.720 --> 25:07.320
can be found here, either side
of the trachea and larynx.

25:07.320 --> 25:10.440
Abraded mark on the neck
lies across the hyoid bone.

25:10.440 --> 25:14.280
It slopes upwards, suggesting the
ligature was pulled upwards...

25:17.720 --> 25:19.160
..from behind.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.200
Who would want her dead?

25:48.800 --> 25:50.120
Sir?

25:54.480 --> 25:56.040
Sir.

25:58.360 --> 25:59.560
OK.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.760
STUDENTS MURMUR

26:32.200 --> 26:34.920
Sir, maybe you should
take a few days?

26:34.920 --> 26:37.360
For yourself.
Be with your family.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.080
A lot of work to do.

26:41.080 --> 26:42.840
I need to work.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.120
Lysette?

27:00.040 --> 27:02.160
Lysette?

27:02.160 --> 27:04.600
Sorry I missed school, sir.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.240
So am I.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.560
Can I...

27:16.560 --> 27:18.960
May I come back?

27:18.960 --> 27:20.640
Yes, you may.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.640
Mr Taylor.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.560
We haven't told her yet.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.040
I wanted to speak to you first.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.120
You need to tell her.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.120
I intend to.
She needs to see.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.520
Everyone needs to see
what this is doing to us.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.000
To all of us.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.040
Are you OK?

27:47.040 --> 27:49.760
Yeah. Of course.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.360
She came on to me
and she actually kissed me.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.160
No! Out of the blue.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.760
Why would anyone want to come on
to you?

27:55.760 --> 27:58.400
Cheers. You come to me
for the truth, Jack.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.080
Ah!

28:00.080 --> 28:01.880
Clarissa...

28:01.880 --> 28:04.160
..I thought you'd given up.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.120
EXHALES

28:23.720 --> 28:25.520
Blood.

28:25.520 --> 28:28.760
Hmm. You reckon you can grab
DNA off that skirt?

28:28.760 --> 28:30.080
Yeah.

28:30.080 --> 28:34.360
Probably more DNA than...
than we want.

28:34.360 --> 28:37.960
The stain is a body fluid here.
Will you swab it?

28:37.960 --> 28:40.240
Mm-hm.
I'll send the heels off for DNA.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.040
Hey, Lysette.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.480
Lysette?

28:57.640 --> 28:59.120
Call the police.

29:02.080 --> 29:05.040
Make sure nobody
hears about the money.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.960
Hear me? Leave her alone.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.280
Or what?

29:09.280 --> 29:11.400
I won't allow this in our community.

29:11.400 --> 29:14.160
Huh? What community is that?

29:14.160 --> 29:16.160
Your community?

29:16.160 --> 29:17.840
You aren't like us, you know.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.120
You may look like us,
but you ain't us.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.920
Who do you think you are?

29:21.920 --> 29:25.160
You think you're better than me,
innit? That's what you think.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.520
We've already called the police.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.640
SCOFFS

29:33.680 --> 29:35.680
See ya in a bit, Lysette.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.360
Did he hurt you, Lysette?

29:41.360 --> 29:43.000
He gave me money.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.760
For what?

29:45.760 --> 29:47.280
To be nice.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.960
How do you know him, Lysette?

29:51.960 --> 29:53.560
My mother.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.240
And how did she know him?

30:12.600 --> 30:15.120
It's light.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.760
We need some cash.
We'll make it up later, blud.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.760
You don't decide that.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.560
Are you threatening me?

31:13.400 --> 31:15.800
..then you replace the filter.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.480
That's how the fentanyl
was delivered to Faith.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.240
Would she have known?

31:24.120 --> 31:25.960
I think it's unlikely.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.560
She was murdered?

31:32.280 --> 31:34.480
It's an extremely toxic opioid.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.880
She may not have known.

31:46.520 --> 31:49.160
SHOPPER: 95. Yep, that's perfect.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.800
You're very kind, madam.
Thank you. Thank you. Bye.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.080
We have drugs.
We have knives.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.120
15 years of knife crime.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.120

Two.

was the crime scene sealed?

36:38.560 --> 36:40.920
As soon as the police attended. Why?

36:40.920 --> 36:43.480
The killer may have tracked blood
as they left.

36:43.480 --> 36:44.920
There's nothing on the body.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.520

36:46.520 --> 36:48.280

your killer.

you've stopped me?

38:16.680 --> 38:19.560
You match the description of someone
who was seen committing a crime.

38:19.560 --> 38:20.800
Of course.

38:22.840 --> 38:24.760
Mr Taylor?

38:24.760 --> 38:27.240
Yes.

38:27.240 --> 38:31.560
Do you remember me? Danny Tresca.
GCSE history, Raynes Park?

38:33.880 --> 38:36.440
Danny!
Greatest history teacher ever.

38:36.440 --> 38:39.720
He could connect everything.
You still teaching?

38:39.720 --> 38:42.200
Head teacher at
Cerrington Academy, yeah.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.040
That's totally cool.
Congratulations.

38:44.040 --> 38:45.680
Those kids are very lucky.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.800
I hope they think so.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.440
Well, Danny,
you've done well for yourself.

38:50.440 --> 38:51.880
Thank you, sir.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.880
Can we give you a lift somewhere?

38:53.880 --> 38:55.720
No, no.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.400
I'm not going too far.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.000
Good to see you.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.840
Safe. You got one for you?

39:20.840 --> 39:22.320
Yeah.

39:23.560 --> 39:27.280
Look, you know we got to do this?
Right? This is our ends.

39:27.280 --> 39:30.160
We got to keep it us. Yeah?

39:30.160 --> 39:31.480
Let's go.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.240
RADIO CHATTER

39:52.000 --> 39:54.320
SIREN WAILS

40:01.840 --> 40:03.760
Let them know you're here,
so they respect you.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.280
They've got to respect you.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.200
It just doesn't feel right, bruv.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.520
Don't bottle on me.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.440
Let's go.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.240
RUDI GROANS
CUSTOMERS SCREAM

40:57.440 --> 40:59.440
SIREN WAILS

41:02.880 --> 41:05.320
We've got the CCTV. OK.

41:05.320 --> 41:07.000
Multiple stab wounds.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.080
Won't be able to tell you
which one was first,

41:10.080 --> 41:12.640
but I should be able to tell you
which one was fatal. Pockets?

41:12.640 --> 41:14.440
Right.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.920
FK Partizani.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.520
Another stabbing.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.400
The other body's through there.

42:06.880 --> 42:08.280
CLARISSA: Thomas?

42:08.280 --> 42:09.920
Have a look.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.760
The CCTV from the club.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.400
Rudi was there the night Faith died.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.480
I think he might be a person
of interest. How about you?

42:46.280 --> 42:49.040
The deceased is named Andre Craven.

42:49.040 --> 42:50.960
21 years old.

42:52.320 --> 42:55.400
Multiple bruises
and lacerations to the face.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.440
I need your help, Jesse.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.640
I'm sorry about your sister, innit?

43:47.640 --> 43:49.440
"Innit"?

43:49.440 --> 43:51.160
What does "innit" mean?

43:51.160 --> 43:53.040
My sister's dead cos of you!

43:53.040 --> 43:54.560
I didn't do nothing.

43:54.560 --> 43:57.080
I swear to God, fam.
You think I wanted that?

43:57.080 --> 43:58.440
YOU gave her the drugs!

43:58.440 --> 44:00.000
I didn't, I swear.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.040
Please, Jesse.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.480
Please.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.760
Zeno Keller.

44:08.760 --> 44:12.520
We've got prints on the
murder weapon that match Rudi Kola.

44:12.520 --> 44:16.880
And these footwear markings
found at the scene of crime -

44:16.880 --> 44:19.920
they match Rudi Kola's trainers.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.000
So Rudi was the murderer
of Zeno Keller?

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Yes, so the evidence would show.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.440
And tests indicate the knife
that was used to kill Rudi

44:28.440 --> 44:30.880
had two distinct DNA profiles on it.

44:30.880 --> 44:33.200
We found traces of
Jack's blood under the hilt.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.840
Glen Cole murdered Rudi?

44:35.840 --> 44:39.000
We know the same knife was
used to stab both Jack and Rudi.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.680
Retribution killings?

44:40.680 --> 44:43.840
Maybe.
We found an encrypted phone,

44:43.840 --> 44:47.920
£1,000 and this on Rudi.

44:47.920 --> 44:50.720
The constituents that we found
of the fentanyl

44:50.720 --> 44:54.280
match that which we found
in the doctored cigarette.

44:54.280 --> 44:57.520
The DNA on the filter matches
Faith Taylor.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.160
So it's very likely that the drug
came from the same batch

45:00.160 --> 45:01.680
that killed Faith.

45:02.880 --> 45:07.240
CLARISSA: And CCTV footage places
Rudi at the club on the night.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.680
Rudi gave her the fentanyl?

45:08.680 --> 45:10.920
Possible, not certain.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.040
DOOR OPENS

45:16.800 --> 45:18.120
Mum?

45:21.240 --> 45:23.080
Did you forget something?

45:35.400 --> 45:36.920
Come in.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.720
Are you hungry?

45:54.360 --> 45:55.800
Shut the door.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.520
You let him into our house?

46:27.520 --> 46:29.320
Yes.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.720
I brought him.

46:30.720 --> 46:32.560
I didn't hurt your daughter.

46:32.560 --> 46:35.200
I've never hurt her.
Why are you here?

46:35.200 --> 46:37.320
I've got nowhere else to go.

46:40.480 --> 46:41.920
I want you to leave.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.800
Please, eat. Grace!

46:47.800 --> 46:49.840
I believe him.

DOORBELL RINGS

47:03.640 --> 47:06.720
Mr Taylor. Sorry to disturb you.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.320
May I come in?

47:08.320 --> 47:09.840
What do you want?

47:11.200 --> 47:14.480
We think we've found the person
who gave the drugs to your daughter.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.600
He was killed, but we can match
the drugs in his possession

47:18.600 --> 47:21.120
with the drugs administered
to Faith.

47:21.120 --> 47:23.760
I believe Glen Cole is
our main suspect in that murder.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.320
I believe your daughter knew him.

47:28.320 --> 47:30.640
Victim Support will be in touch.

47:33.160 --> 47:35.520
He's chatting shit.
I didn't kill nobody.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.760
I never gave her the drugs.

47:37.760 --> 47:42.240
I'll go to prison, because that's
what happens to people like me.

47:42.240 --> 47:46.160
They're not gonna touch him.
And you're OK with that?

47:46.160 --> 47:48.040
Who gave you the drugs?

47:48.040 --> 47:49.720
And where do I find him?

47:51.760 --> 47:53.760
Thanks. Bye. Bye.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.760
All right? All right.

47:59.440 --> 48:01.080
Want to make some money?

48:03.280 --> 48:04.800
What kind of money?

48:14.960 --> 48:17.080
The blood on the heel
of Pamela's shoe?

48:18.600 --> 48:23.680
It's a hit. Matches the DNA
in four unsolved rape cases.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.920
And matches the DNA found
on Andre Craven's body.

48:26.920 --> 48:28.920
That's huge. Yeah.

48:41.400 --> 48:42.960
Where are you going?

48:44.800 --> 48:46.240
Just stay here.

49:01.120 --> 49:02.880
CLARISSA: The attacker here
also raped

49:02.880 --> 49:05.240
and potentially murdered Pamela.

49:05.240 --> 49:07.560
Hold on. Can I see that again?

49:15.480 --> 49:17.840
Nikki, would you get
my laptop, please?

49:26.240 --> 49:27.480
Hmm.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.720
Look at the man with Rudi Kola.

49:37.200 --> 49:39.440
Hmm.

49:39.440 --> 49:40.800
Same man?

49:48.160 --> 49:50.160
Could be.

49:50.160 --> 49:51.640
That tattoo on his neck...

49:58.120 --> 50:00.760
You and me, we can do business.

50:03.400 --> 50:05.720
I'm gonna make you rich. Come.

50:10.200 --> 50:11.960
You work with me.

50:13.920 --> 50:15.600
I teach you.

50:17.240 --> 50:19.720
I show you how to rise.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.280
Come on.

50:25.760 --> 50:27.560
Try this.

50:27.560 --> 50:29.840
Blows your head off.

50:29.840 --> 50:31.680
Powder is the thing, yeah?

50:31.680 --> 50:35.920
Give it to a girl,
they smoke it, they gone.

50:35.920 --> 50:38.160
You can do anything you want
to them.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.280
SCREAMS

50:42.280 --> 50:44.640
You think I don't know you was
there when they stuck Rudi?

50:44.640 --> 50:46.600
You think I don't know
you were part of it?

50:46.600 --> 50:48.520
Let him go!
GASPS

50:50.280 --> 50:52.000
The police are on their way.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
There's enough time to kill him.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.200
You won't hurt anyone again.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.640
And then you.

50:58.640 --> 51:00.840
You think you're going to stop me?

51:00.840 --> 51:02.560
Stop me!

51:02.560 --> 51:04.880
Now is your chance.

51:04.880 --> 51:07.080
I'm your escape.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.800
I'm your excuse.

51:18.800 --> 51:21.040
No!
RAMUSH ROARS

51:25.080 --> 51:27.320
Run! You're not part of this.

51:27.320 --> 51:29.720
Go! You don't belong here.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.960
Go! Please.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.320
RAMUSH WHEEZES

51:43.960 --> 51:46.600
GASPS AND CHOKES

52:20.320 --> 52:23.160
SIRENS APPROACH

52:25.480 --> 52:28.640
Police! Please put your hands above
your head.

52:28.640 --> 52:29.960
Get down!

52:29.960 --> 52:32.080
NOAH: Thank you all for your
messages of condolence

52:32.080 --> 52:33.480
and your prayers.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.400
Tomorrow, I bury my daughter.

52:41.040 --> 52:45.160
Although she had boundless energy,
I will lay her to rest.

52:46.920 --> 52:50.560
And I will do that in the knowledge
that I did not...

52:50.560 --> 52:52.560
protect her well enough.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.160
I failed her.

53:00.920 --> 53:04.800
I want you to turn to the person
on your right

53:04.800 --> 53:06.360
and the person on your left.

53:06.360 --> 53:08.880
Tell them...

53:08.880 --> 53:10.720
that you will not fail them.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.480
Do it.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.360
STUDENTS: I promise not to fail you.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.880
We all hope and pray
for a just world.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.320
A fair world.

53:25.320 --> 53:27.760
A kind world.

53:27.760 --> 53:31.280
But we must recognise there
are consequences for everything.

53:31.280 --> 53:33.480
Nothing is free from consequence.

53:36.880 --> 53:40.400
Your chains are in your minds
and in your hearts.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.600
They are your fears.

53:42.600 --> 53:44.400
And your temptations.

53:52.760 --> 53:55.760
She scratched her neck
trying to free herself.

53:55.760 --> 53:57.880
It'll be her blood
on the back of the belt.

54:01.440 --> 54:03.080
He strangled Pamela Trill.

54:07.840 --> 54:09.800
Didn't she have a daughter?

54:11.040 --> 54:13.880
You all have within you
the capacity to be heroic...

54:15.400 --> 54:17.080
..to surpass yourself...

54:19.040 --> 54:21.120
..because you are...

54:21.120 --> 54:24.440
STUDENTS: The stuff that dreams
are made of.

54:47.440 --> 54:50.480
"Save us," screamed the..."

54:52.040 --> 54:53.880
Remember it? Fleshlumpeater.

54:53.880 --> 54:58.960
"..Fleshlumpeater,
thrashing about m...

54:59.160 --> 55:01.800
"..madly." Good.

55:01.800 --> 55:04.040
READING FADES

55:21.520 --> 55:23.560
Yeah, that's a foot in a pizza bag.

55:23.560 --> 55:26.280
Right, let's see if we can
find the rest of this body.

55:26.280 --> 55:28.240
Dismembering a body by hand
is hard work.

55:28.240 --> 55:30.040
Takes time, not to mention a mess.

55:31.320 --> 55:34.720
CLARISSA: What you're looking at
is an Irezumi body suit.

55:34.720 --> 55:39.080
So no identifiable DNA,
but we do have the tattoos.

55:39.080 --> 55:42.040
Does this tattooist have a name?
This is his unique signature.

55:42.040 --> 55:43.840
A carving butterfly.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.880
What can you tell us?

55:45.880 --> 55:47.600
Anything.

55:47.600 --> 55:49.760
NIKKI: We'll find out more
when we do the postmortem.

55:49.760 --> 55:52.600
By the smell of it, someone's been
using a lot of bleach in here.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.040
Akito Amon?

55:55.040 --> 55:56.600
Police!

55:59.280 --> 56:00.840
I had a beautiful girlfriend,

56:00.840 --> 56:03.200
and I was on the brink of
an amazing weekend.

56:07.440 --> 56:12.480
# Testator silens

56:16.760 --> 56:21.840
# Costestes e spiritu
