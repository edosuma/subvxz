00:16.059 --> 00:19.454
- Bro, I told you I don't
like talking on these phones.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.021
- You coming out tonight?

00:21.064 --> 00:23.501
I got you at the door,
come to my table.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.025
- Nah, I'm good man.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.722
I'm done with all the bullshit.

00:26.765 --> 00:29.246
Heck, it's probably some wack
social media star's birthday

00:29.290 --> 00:31.901
anyway who's probably underage,
and you know what that

00:31.944 --> 00:36.036
leads to, me getting drunk,
talking shit, wanting to do

00:36.079 --> 00:38.081
a bump of some
bitch's tits, alright,

00:38.125 --> 00:41.041
and that leads to the after
party, and that leads to me

00:41.084 --> 00:43.695
seeing the sun come up,
and then I'm hungry.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.655
So now I need a double double
with the grilled onions

00:46.698 --> 00:49.962
and the little peppers I like,
alright, vanilla milkshake,

00:50.006 --> 00:50.920
animal style.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.443
I can't do that no more man.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.358
- I don't see the problem.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.099
- Of course it's not a problem.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.058
And that's the problem, alright?

00:58.101 --> 00:59.233
I gotta stay focused man.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.799
I'm on the grind.

01:00.843 --> 01:04.803
A great philosopher once
said, no more parties in L.A.

01:04.846 --> 01:07.415
That fool's crazy, man!

01:18.730 --> 01:20.080
Hey yo babe, is that you?

01:41.362 --> 01:42.928
- I'm gonna
text you the address,

01:42.972 --> 01:44.408
ask for--
- Hey.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.541
- I want you to be
there, it's all good brother.

01:46.584 --> 01:50.849
- Hey babe, I told you I wanted
to be on some kinky shit,

01:50.893 --> 01:54.375
but this is some
real freaky shit.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.376
I'm with it.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.249
Baby?

02:30.150 --> 02:33.153
- Hey, got the address to
the after party, it's lit.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.982
- Um, excuse me Dre.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.593
- Oh hey, what's up girl?

02:38.636 --> 02:40.116
- You're not gonna
text me the address?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.248
- Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.466
Put your number in
my phone right now.

02:42.510 --> 02:43.772
- How do you not have
my cell phone number,

02:43.815 --> 02:44.860
what's wrong with you?

02:44.903 --> 02:46.209
- It's a great plan!

02:46.253 --> 02:47.167
I've been trying to get
your number for awhile.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.124
I'm just trying to take you out.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.081
You like in and out burgers?

02:49.125 --> 02:50.213
- We're gonna relax with that.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.215
- Alright, sorry,
let's start here.

02:52.259 --> 02:55.392
- Alright, okay, here you go.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.698
- Alright, perfect.

02:56.741 --> 03:01.355
I'm gonna text you
the address right now.

03:02.138 --> 03:02.834
- Okay, got it.

03:02.878 --> 03:03.357
Wait, wait, wait, Dre?

03:04.445 --> 03:05.794
What's up with that Ryder guy?

03:05.837 --> 03:07.230
You think he'll
be there tonight?

03:07.274 --> 03:10.799
- Oh, Ryder, he pop in,
see what it's like maybe.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.502
- Babe, I was thinking
the exact same thing.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.330
So fucking annoying.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.288
This is my girlfriend Nina.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.506
Nina, this is Dre.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.856
- Hey, hola, mi amiga.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.119
- Oh no.

03:28.338 --> 03:31.123
- Oh, it's like your
girlfriend, girlfriend?

03:31.167 --> 03:33.691
- No Dre, come on, she's not
my girlfriend girlfriend.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.695
Okay, sometimes
she's my girlfriend.

03:37.739 --> 03:38.609
- Oh.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.089
- Tequila.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.268
- Tequila, if ya'll ever
need somebody else, call me.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.227
- I see, I see.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.186
- So like, ya'll wanna come?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.841

03:55.235 --> 03:56.279

03:58.890 --> 04:00.370

04:00.414 --> 04:02.677
What dah fuck going on man?

04:02.720 --> 04:05.157
Bro, I heard you got the
addy to the after party,

04:05.201 --> 04:08.248
the last after party you
invited me to was dope as fuck.

04:08.291 --> 04:11.425
- I don't know nothing about
no type of after party.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.687
- What?

04:12.730 --> 04:14.254
Come on man, don't hold
out on me like that.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.907
Just give me the address.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.300
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.607
I would tell you if there
was an after, come on.

04:19.649 --> 04:23.306
- Hey Dre, we'll see you at
the after party babe, chow!

04:23.350 --> 04:24.133
- Oh, chow!

04:25.265 --> 04:26.396
- Come on, what the
fuck was that man?

04:26.440 --> 04:28.180
Don't do me dirty like that.

04:28.224 --> 04:30.487
Don't make me beg.

04:30.531 --> 04:34.056
Fuck man, I told you my mixed
tape is coming out soon.

04:34.099 --> 04:36.624
Young Classic, A.K.A.
Young C, A.K.A. me,

04:36.667 --> 04:37.929
needs to be there man.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.975
I gotta entertain
the people man.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.151
Seriously, need me be.

04:42.194 --> 04:44.849
- The streets do
not need you, okay?

04:44.893 --> 04:49.071
But look, you can come through
on one condition, calm down.

04:49.114 --> 04:51.334
You have to bring a girl.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.945
A female.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.295
Look at me.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.340
I don't care: young,
C, A, B, L-M-N-O-P,

04:57.384 --> 04:58.254
I don't give a fuck.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.516
You need to bring a girl.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.649
- Alright man, say
less, I got you.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.042
I'm gonna bring the
baddest biddy just for you.

05:04.086 --> 05:04.826
You're the man.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.349
- I'm for real.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.786
I can't lose my job 'cause
of you, Malibu's Most Wanted.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.663
Damn girl, what's
wrong with you?

05:15.706 --> 05:16.881
- Will you hurry
up and get back up?

05:16.925 --> 05:17.795
- What?

05:17.839 --> 05:19.319
- Pretend you're talking to me.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.146
- Oh shit, you're Sky!

05:21.190 --> 05:23.061
- No fucking shit.

05:23.105 --> 05:25.673
Now look behind me and
see if April's there.

05:25.716 --> 05:26.978
- April?

05:27.022 --> 05:29.285
- My assistant, skinny
girl, pulled back hair.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.069
Hey, focus on me.

05:31.113 --> 05:32.810
- My bad, ma'am.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.116
- Don't call me ma'am.

05:34.159 --> 05:36.248
- Oh my goodness,
look who it is.

05:36.292 --> 05:39.121
The most hard core baddy
in town, Sky herself.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.818
Why don't you say what's up
to the best fans in the world,

05:40.862 --> 05:41.645
the Teddy man!

05:42.864 --> 05:45.823
Fuck, shit, suck a
dick, piece of shit.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.129
I will fuck you in the butt.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.260
Oh, there we go.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.437
And we back, Bear
Squad, what's--

05:50.480 --> 05:51.481
- Idiot.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.396
- What'd you just say?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.398
- Um, idiot.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.878
- Why don't you just say
something to the camera, Sky.

05:56.921 --> 05:59.315
You know, fans love when I
talk to the little people,

05:59.359 --> 06:00.925
you know?

06:00.969 --> 06:03.058
- Go, she doesn't want to be
filmed you freaking loser.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.800
- You freaking, who even
says freaking anymore, huh?

06:05.843 --> 06:08.193
Alright, whatever, no one
even cares about you anymore

06:08.237 --> 06:10.848
which is no talent
having ass bitch.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.546
- At least I'm not
a fake asshole.

06:12.589 --> 06:15.418
Go somewhere with more
teddy bears you fuck boy.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.941
- She was legal, alright?

06:16.985 --> 06:18.290
- Mmhmm.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.944
- She had ID.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.250
- What took you so long?

06:21.293 --> 06:22.556
- I'm sorry, I lost
you in the crowd.

06:22.599 --> 06:26.647
- Hey ladies, we do have
a party in the Hills.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.300
I would love it
if you would come.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.085
I know Sky, this may be
a little bit beneath you,

06:30.128 --> 06:33.393
but if you came, the
party would go crazy.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.350
- Will there be drugs?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.569
- Oh, we're gonna have all--

06:35.612 --> 06:36.526
- Insane, of course I will be.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.006
So, get the address.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.442
- Yes, Sky.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.922
- I hope Chuck will be there,
you know, he always has

06:40.965 --> 06:42.097
the best supplies.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.403
- Yes, Sky.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.969
- Oh, and make sure
the driver's outside.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.536
I don't want to get
mauled by the crowds.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.016
- Oh shit, is this Sky?

06:48.059 --> 06:49.452
Sky, yo, can we take a selfie?

06:49.496 --> 06:52.455
- April, handle this.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.282
- Bye.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.416
Thanks, sorry about that.

06:56.459 --> 06:57.895
- Nah, it's all good.

06:57.939 --> 06:58.679
But I'm gonna head out.

06:58.722 --> 06:59.462
I can't be late.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.594
I'll see ya'll there.

07:00.637 --> 07:01.725
- Okay.

07:01.769 --> 07:02.683
I'm coming!

07:13.128 --> 07:14.434
- Wait, why are you stopping?

07:14.477 --> 07:16.392
It's like, a couple houses
up and on the right.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.699
- Nah, we're good here.

07:18.742 --> 07:21.397
- But there's like so, so
many parking spots in front

07:21.441 --> 07:22.180
of the house.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.530
- I said, we good here.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.185
- Are you embarrassed
to roll up in this car?

07:27.229 --> 07:29.144
I kinda would be.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.494
- Okay look, I have
an image to portray.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.236
I can't just roll up
in the shit mobile.

07:34.279 --> 07:37.282
Okay, like, if anyone sees me
in this, that will completely

07:37.326 --> 07:38.501
fuck up my image.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.286
I sing about hella hoes
and getting bitches

07:41.330 --> 07:43.550
and getting racks, like
if I'm seen in this,

07:43.593 --> 07:45.160
my image is ruined.

07:45.203 --> 07:48.380
- Right, so, you're a sound
cloud rapper which means

07:48.424 --> 07:49.469
there's like no image.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.513
Like, not at all.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.775
You're kind of no one.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.124
I can't even probably
get you into this party.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.604
But we're gonna try.

07:54.648 --> 07:57.389
- Goddammit Brittany, you're
suppose to be on my side.

07:57.433 --> 07:58.782
- Well, I'm here for you.

08:00.218 --> 08:03.352
- Look, just have my back, okay?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.920
I need you to get in this party.

08:05.963 --> 08:08.444
All it really takes is a couple
of influencers is to just

08:08.488 --> 08:10.577
put me on their story
and like, I can blow up.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.797
- Alright well, this better
be worth it 'cause I'm getting

08:13.841 --> 08:15.538
up at 6am and doing Runnion.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.584
We have so much
coming up, Cochela--

08:17.627 --> 08:20.369
- So basic.
- The Iron Man is in 4 months,

08:20.412 --> 08:22.545
I need to look good,
this is important.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.068
- So basic.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.548
- Okay, let's go.

08:28.551 --> 08:29.421
What are you doing?

08:29.465 --> 08:31.075
What, what are you doing?

08:31.119 --> 08:31.989
- Visualizing.

08:33.207 --> 08:36.602
If I can see it,
I can achieve it.

08:36.645 --> 08:37.952
- Why are we friends?

08:41.520 --> 08:43.260
Okay, you visualize.

08:45.002 --> 08:49.529
Oh my gosh, TMZ
posted Ray Dape died.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.835
He committed suicide:
asphyxiation.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.316
- Asphyxiation.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.666
- Whatever, like, he killed
himself with a sex hole.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.799
It's like that old
dude from Kill Bill.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.496
- Okay, it's probably
just fake news.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.411
TMZ is always spreading fake
shit like that saying people

09:02.454 --> 09:04.456
died when they're clearly alive.

09:05.980 --> 09:09.461
- Or, there's a secret group
of people, oh my gosh yes,

09:09.505 --> 09:12.595
yes, secret group of people,
and they're killing famous

09:12.639 --> 09:15.555
people and making it look
like random suicides.

09:15.598 --> 09:16.773
This is crazy.

09:16.817 --> 09:20.255
- Yeah, okay.

09:21.691 --> 09:22.866
- What is this?

09:22.910 --> 09:23.737
- Time to go.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.699
- Damn, firey ass,
little ass Latina.

09:29.743 --> 09:33.181
I'll be at the after
party in 20 minutes, baby.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.052
- Hey sorry, sorry, I'm
sorry for being late sir.

09:35.096 --> 09:38.099
- Hey man, slow down with your
chocolate Snickers looking

09:38.142 --> 09:39.579
ass, man.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.711
You're mighty tall for an
old baby face mother fucker.

09:41.755 --> 09:42.973
- Here you go.

09:44.496 --> 09:45.976
- For sure man, relax.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.719
You think I was
trying to hit on you?

09:49.763 --> 09:51.547
Aw man, well what if I was?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.201
- Um, thanks.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.724
- Hey man, chill, chill.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.552

10:33.371 --> 10:35.678

10:35.722 --> 10:36.723

10:37.898 --> 10:39.247
- I think just a
couple eight balls.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.509
I'm just trying to
get low key turn.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.511
- Wait, wait, I'm a weed dealer.

10:42.554 --> 10:45.035
I don't deal illegal narcotics.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.689
- Shut the fuck up,

10:46.733 --> 10:49.649
You telling me the white boy

11:09.799 --> 11:10.931
I'm a vlogger.

11:10.974 --> 11:13.063
- Oh bro, you got me.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.935
That's actually neat.

11:14.978 --> 11:18.547
You get to meet, you
know, real celebrities?

11:18.590 --> 11:20.244
You know, actual famous people?

11:20.288 --> 11:21.332
- Fuck you, man.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.856
I am famous, for real!

11:22.899 --> 11:25.336
- Sorry, I didn't
mean to offend you.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.556
- Can't believe I texted
the weed dude instead

11:27.599 --> 11:28.818
of the coke dude, goddamn.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.646
You know, I was gonna

Bring you a little
business, you know,

11:31.908 --> 11:35.303

Nation that you knew me.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.000
But instead, take this.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.351
Boom, bitch!

11:44.747 --> 11:45.879
- So vlogging is
a real thing, huh?

11:45.922 --> 11:47.489
- Yeah.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.361
- You know?

11:50.405 --> 11:55.018
All of you influencers
are talentless wannabees.

11:56.628 --> 12:00.023
All of that content is so,
it's so goddamn cringe.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.590
None of it's funny.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.026
And you definitely can't act.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.770
You've wasted enough of my time.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.685
Just go through whatever lame
after party you're headed to

12:09.729 --> 12:11.687
with all of those lapid people.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.254
- Gross, I don't even vape.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.431
- Just, just be careful.

12:17.562 --> 12:18.868
You never know
what's gonna happen.

12:24.439 --> 12:25.745
- White dudes are weird, man.

12:29.313 --> 12:33.274
- Babe, I feel like
this is the house.

12:37.669 --> 12:40.368
Yes, this is the
address that he sent us.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.849
Squeeze said he will
be here in 20 minutes.

12:45.677 --> 12:46.853
What's wrong with you?

12:50.944 --> 12:52.554
Okay, of course I want
to make out with you,

12:52.597 --> 12:54.774
but give me a
couple more drinks.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.646
Let's like go in the party
and see what's going on,

12:57.689 --> 13:00.780
and you're crazy
right now, Jesus.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.521
Should I pin my hair
up or leave it down.

13:03.565 --> 13:04.479
Does it look okay?

13:07.830 --> 13:10.050
Okay, I knew that was
just a one time thing.

13:10.093 --> 13:14.315
Come on let's go.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.798
- Did you tell the driver
to wait for 45 minutes

13:18.841 --> 13:21.191
and come back in the morning
if we didn't come out by then?

13:21.235 --> 13:24.455
- Yes, Sky, but why don't
we just call or text someone

13:24.499 --> 13:25.848
when we're ready to leave?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.807
- Look at your phone.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.679
See those little bars?

13:30.722 --> 13:32.159
- No.

13:32.202 --> 13:35.858
- Exactly, there is no
reception meaning no service.

13:37.425 --> 13:38.818
Come on, let's get inside.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.824
- Boo, did you hear that
raging fucking died?

13:47.261 --> 13:48.131
That's insane.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.786
That's like the craziest thing.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.660
I have to fuck this guy tonight.

14:35.918 --> 14:39.574
- I guess the party's
in he sound proof room?

14:40.792 --> 14:42.577
It's probably upstairs, ladies?

14:53.980 --> 14:56.939
- Wait, this coat is so
good, is it real fur?

14:56.983 --> 14:57.984
- You noticed that.

14:59.681 --> 15:00.856
- Do you know who
these girls are?

15:00.900 --> 15:01.770
- No.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.163
- Should I respond to them?

15:03.206 --> 15:05.513
What about him?

15:05.556 --> 15:06.688
Is he someone I should know?

15:06.731 --> 15:07.863
- He's a model.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.691
You worked on a campaign
with him before.

15:09.734 --> 15:10.953
- Oh.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.520
- You know we can
hear you, right?

15:13.738 --> 15:16.089
- April, they can hear
you, you're being rude.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.400
- Yo, yo, hey, that's

16:07.923 --> 16:10.752
Yeah, I don't play games.

16:10.795 --> 16:13.885
I swear to God,
man, I'm a stray.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.628
Yo, what you think?

16:20.370 --> 16:22.851
Bro, that was trash.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.026
Come on, man.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.593
I wasn't even recording, dude.

16:25.636 --> 16:29.205
Look, only the most quality
content goes on my baby, okay?

16:29.249 --> 16:31.773
And at this point, even if
your chick offered to sit

16:31.816 --> 16:33.688
on my penis, I wouldn't
put you on the vlog.

16:33.731 --> 16:35.081
- Oh, not even with these?

16:36.038 --> 16:39.041

16:39.085 --> 16:40.869
Titties, litties.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.045
Flow, shitty.

16:43.089 --> 16:43.959
Have a good night.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.179
- You know what?

16:46.222 --> 16:48.050
I tried really hard
for you, but I like it.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.096
It was good, me, oh my gosh.

16:50.139 --> 16:53.882
You should make
a vegan rap song.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.449
Viral.

16:55.492 --> 16:58.017
- Okay, Brittany, just because
you're vegan doesn't mean

16:58.060 --> 17:00.193
everything needs to
be about vegan shit.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.064
No one cares that you're vegan.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.022
We just like your tits.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.068
- Just like no body
likes your mixed tape.

17:06.112 --> 17:06.938
- Oh, got me.

17:23.128 --> 17:23.954
- Anybody here?

17:32.181 --> 17:33.965
Hey, whaddup?

17:34.009 --> 17:36.751
You seen two little
Latinas just walk in here?

One of 'em only speaks Spanish?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.581

17:45.673 --> 17:47.240
- What the fuck did you

17:48.545 --> 17:51.157
- I mean, uh, no sir.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.116
I have not seen the two females
that match that description.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.639
- Yeah.

17:55.683 --> 17:57.380

Oh, jack pot, yeah.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.330
Fuck it they want it.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.642
- In cut two, two
girls walk into frame.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.774
One turns and says to me--

18:43.818 --> 18:46.081
- Who the fuck are you?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.866
- And I respond by
saying hi, I'm Angelo.

18:48.910 --> 18:49.998
Pleasure to meet you.

18:53.741 --> 18:56.744
- What are you like some
film director writer guy?

18:56.787 --> 18:58.224
- Ah, director, honey.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.574
Writers are over wordy and
pretentious, but thank you.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.184
- But feels less.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.537
Why are we laughing?

19:09.365 --> 19:10.149
- Mia.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.718
- What's wrong with you?

19:14.762 --> 19:16.242
What did you say?

19:17.286 --> 19:19.593
- Wow, wow, wow,

19:19.636 --> 19:22.944
You guys are the perfect cast
for that douchy Indy film

19:22.987 --> 19:25.120
about the struggles of
making it in Hollywood.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.558

19:35.696 --> 19:37.219
- Okay, let's go, picture time.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.829
There's nothing better to do.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.879
Oh wait, that's cute.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.059
Well the service sucks,

You got a look.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.118
Look.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.861

20:12.036 --> 20:13.560

20:13.603 --> 20:18.608

Alright, calm down, calm

21:07.657 --> 21:09.093
Here it is, it's show time.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.315
- Was you sleep with

21:16.405 --> 21:18.755
You ever been with a model?

21:22.281 --> 21:24.065

masturbating and thought

21:24.108 --> 21:26.023

21:28.112 --> 21:29.331
Who can relate?

21:34.336 --> 21:36.251
Have you ever eaten some

21:36.295 --> 21:40.211

21:41.996 --> 21:42.953
'Cause its doo-doo.

21:46.914 --> 21:50.918
I'm sorry ya'll, I thought

door was unlocked,

21:54.138 --> 21:55.705
there was snacks
and alcohol set up

21:55.749 --> 21:56.576
but I looked around the crib
and there wasn't no body here.

21:56.619 --> 21:57.968
- Oh I'm here!

21:58.012 --> 22:00.144
- You sure that's
the right address?

22:00.188 --> 22:01.363
- Nah, I swear it is.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.973
Look, this is exactly

22:05.454 --> 22:08.414
- Hold up, so it's just us here?

22:10.416 --> 22:14.028
Big, empty house, random
group of unlikable people

22:14.071 --> 22:17.771
come together, oh

22:17.814 --> 22:19.381
There's something
here, do you smell it?

22:19.425 --> 22:20.295
This is a movie.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.385
- Like a horror
film, but a real one.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.130
- Where all of you die.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.524
- Nah, nah, nah, I said a movie.

22:31.567 --> 22:32.829
Not a documentary.

22:32.873 --> 22:33.743
A documentary is
a bunch of people

22:33.787 --> 22:34.222
talking about boring shit.

22:35.397 --> 22:39.009
- Uh yeah, I got alcohol

22:39.053 --> 22:40.228
This is dead.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.665
So yeah, next one champ.

22:42.709 --> 22:43.927
- I'm here baby!

22:43.971 --> 22:45.407
Who's going skiing with me?

22:46.539 --> 22:48.889
- Wait, it don't snow in L.A.

22:48.932 --> 22:52.501
- Awe, that's cute, but he's
talking about cocaine, honey.

22:52.545 --> 22:53.328
- Oh.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.984
- So uh, where's it at?

22:58.464 --> 23:02.729
You, something about you.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.383
Reeks of nose candy.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.822
- Yeah, I party party.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.433
- And I'm assuming
you're in film?

23:11.477 --> 23:12.956
- That is correct.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.524
- Man, you're just a
walking cliche, aren't you?

23:15.568 --> 23:17.483
- Hey but you know, I
appreciate you that though,

23:17.526 --> 23:20.050
dog what's up, Ted, best
vlogger in the world.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.270

director in the game.

23:22.313 --> 23:23.445
- Hey, nice to meet you man.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.751

23:24.794 --> 23:26.405

23:26.448 --> 23:28.972
You guys don't hear that?

23:29.016 --> 23:30.060
- Probably just
some drunk people

23:30.104 --> 23:31.410
messing around upstairs, man.

23:35.152 --> 23:36.327
- Yo, yo!

23:38.417 --> 23:40.331

23:43.117 --> 23:44.553
I know I heard something.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.294
- Yeah, yeah, dude!

23:46.337 --> 23:48.122
Oh that sound of my mixed tape!

23:48.165 --> 23:52.953
Fucked a bitch last night, yo

23:52.996 --> 23:56.130
- Ugh, who are you?

23:57.566 --> 24:01.483

24:07.794 --> 24:10.492

dot mad 'cause she can't get

24:10.536 --> 24:12.276
one of your world
famous hand jobs?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.234
- Fuck you, Ted.

24:13.277 --> 24:14.844
Your dad loves my hand jobs.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.324
- Damn, that's hurtful.

24:16.367 --> 24:17.586
You know what?

24:17.630 --> 24:19.762
Let me put you in
the vlog real quick.

24:22.461 --> 24:26.290
Oh what, everyone keep quiet,
here we have a basic hoe

24:26.334 --> 24:28.336
in her natural habitat.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.469
Let's sit back and see
what she does next.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.384
Maybe she'll go for the
alcohol, or maybe she'll pop

24:33.428 --> 24:35.386
one of her favorite
penny pills, right?

24:35.430 --> 24:38.651
Or maybe she'll go suck all
the dicks in the whole room.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.261
- You know you talk a
lot of shit for somebody

24:40.304 --> 24:41.610
who has such a small dick.

24:42.568 --> 24:43.525
- Lame.

24:43.569 --> 24:44.395
- Truth.

24:46.093 --> 24:47.921
- It's pretty, alright?

24:47.964 --> 24:48.704
Ugh, enjoy the edibles.

24:48.748 --> 24:49.531
What is this?

24:51.185 --> 24:52.882
- Oh, I think it's some
kind of weed cookie

24:52.926 --> 24:54.841
to kinda balance the alcohol?

24:54.884 --> 24:56.756
- Counter balance alcohol?

24:56.799 --> 24:57.844
Are you fucking 12?

24:57.887 --> 24:59.541
- I was born in 99.

24:59.585 --> 25:03.371
- 1992, best Disney film
ever made, The Mighty Ducks.

25:03.414 --> 25:04.503
- I said 99.

25:04.546 --> 25:08.419
- Ah, 99, Fight
Club, The Matrix.

25:08.463 --> 25:11.510
Kill this mother fucker.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.469
- Bro, you are weird.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.514
Has anyone ever tried this?

25:15.557 --> 25:16.776
Is it any good?

25:16.819 --> 25:18.952
Oh, I should put it in
the vlog, hashtag ah,

25:18.995 --> 25:20.127
get a little sponsor shit.

25:20.170 --> 25:21.476
Can you hold this for me?

25:21.520 --> 25:23.217
- Of course you'd be
trying to promote something

25:23.260 --> 25:24.784
you sell out.

25:24.827 --> 25:28.439
- Sky, don't be mad just 'cause
I have more views than you.

25:28.483 --> 25:29.571
- I am a brand.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.355
You're just a marketing mistake.

25:32.792 --> 25:33.749
Oh you're so sweet.

25:35.490 --> 25:36.883
Are you eye fucking me.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.062
Anyways, does anyone
know if Shark's coming?

25:42.105 --> 25:45.326
I don't have service to text
him and I'm kinda coming down.

25:45.369 --> 25:46.588
- Who's Shark?

25:46.632 --> 25:48.634
- Wait, you don't
know who he is?

25:48.677 --> 25:51.462
Like, everybody in
L.A. knows who he is.

25:51.506 --> 25:52.986
- I have no idea.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.814
- He's got the best stuff.

25:56.337 --> 25:56.859
Wait, what stuff is that?

25:56.903 --> 25:58.469
- Drugs, man.

25:58.513 --> 25:59.209
What have we been talking
about this whole time?

25:59.253 --> 26:00.428
He's a drug dealer.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.604
- And, everyone's a drug dealer.

26:02.648 --> 26:03.605
- He's reliable.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.302
Which is so hard to find.

26:05.346 --> 26:06.826
And he delivers.

26:06.869 --> 26:11.178
By the way, do you like work
out a lot to get that skinny?

26:11.221 --> 26:12.658
- No babe, I just throw up.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.747
- Oh, I can't do that.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.618
I'm bleaching my teeth.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.012
- So uh, who are you?

26:19.055 --> 26:19.795
Sup girl?

26:19.839 --> 26:20.927
I don't know your name.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.627
Ah okay, you want me to
talk that Mexico talk.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.455
Alright, that's
cool, check this out.

26:27.498 --> 26:28.543
I took Spanish in high school.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.161
- You have, oh, no shot.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.513
- Hey, shut the fuck up,
Sky, no one asked you.

26:46.996 --> 26:47.736
Oh, what you doing?

26:47.780 --> 26:49.651
Oh, okay.

26:49.695 --> 26:54.221
Okay, okay, what ever.

26:54.264 --> 26:55.918
Bitch got herpes anyways.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.747
- April, rest room.

26:58.791 --> 26:59.618
- I'm coming.

27:01.402 --> 27:02.272
- Coke?

27:02.316 --> 27:03.622
- Cocaine, let's do it.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.015
- Uh, fuck Ted.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.322
Everybody thinks just
because he has a cheap camera

27:08.365 --> 27:10.150
he can become Insta-famous now.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.552
What's she saying?

27:21.596 --> 27:23.250
She's super cute though.

27:23.293 --> 27:26.645
Hey, I'm sorry I
dragged you down here.

27:28.516 --> 27:30.387
How long have we been here?

27:30.431 --> 27:31.693
Has it been 45?

27:31.737 --> 27:33.608
- Uh, been here for
about 30 minutes?

27:33.652 --> 27:34.783
Do you wanna leave soon?

27:34.827 --> 27:38.178
The driver won't be
back for another 15.

27:38.221 --> 27:43.226
- Ugh, what can we do for 15?

27:47.100 --> 27:50.451

28:58.084 --> 28:59.999
You know I don't do that.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.744
- And, it doesn't
mean I do drugs.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.571
Drugs are bad for you.

29:07.615 --> 29:09.138
I smoke weed.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.097
And that ain't a drug.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.403
- You got your high and
passed out, didn't you?

29:13.447 --> 29:15.710
- Chill.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.408
- This time I know I
heard someone scream.

29:18.452 --> 29:19.366
- We found Shark.

29:20.671 --> 29:25.807
- Wait, were you both
about to go at it?

29:26.852 --> 29:28.679
Holy shit that's hot.

29:28.723 --> 29:30.638
- Shut up, you're find now.

29:30.681 --> 29:33.119
Move quicker, pass
over the good shit.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.076
- Wait.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.382
- On what?

29:35.425 --> 29:38.254
Stop being such a
goddamn coke block.

29:38.298 --> 29:40.430
- You woke me up
from a threesome.

29:40.474 --> 29:41.344
- What threesome?

29:41.388 --> 29:43.042
- The one I had in my dream.

29:45.740 --> 29:48.395
Titties to the left of me.

29:48.438 --> 29:49.700
Titties to the right.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.357
Titties in front of my face.

29:54.401 --> 29:55.794
- There's gonna be a foot in
your face if you don't hurry

29:55.837 --> 29:56.795
your ass up.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.710
- You're turning me on, Sky.

30:00.711 --> 30:02.496
I missed you.

30:02.539 --> 30:05.629
- Stop it, I don't know
where those lips have been.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.329
But okay, fine,
I missed you too.

30:14.116 --> 30:14.987
- Take your shit.

30:17.728 --> 30:20.862
- April, can you go
find your ring for me?

30:20.906 --> 30:22.646
- Yes, Sky.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.736
- Ope, I guess that's my cue.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.826
Let's go get fucking weird.

30:28.870 --> 30:31.394
- You are such a
fucking asshole.

30:31.438 --> 30:32.221
- What did I do?

30:32.265 --> 30:33.527
- Are you kidding me?

30:33.570 --> 30:35.442
You know you did, you're
such a piece of shit.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.183
- Oh my God, no need
for name calling.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.880
It's very unlady--

30:38.924 --> 30:40.360
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, put the glass down.

30:40.403 --> 30:41.230
What happened?

30:41.274 --> 30:42.014
- Bro, I didn't do shit.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.929
These bitches be crazy.

30:43.972 --> 30:46.018
- What the fucker do again.

30:46.061 --> 30:47.715
- You're right.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.283
- Ted gave home girl some
meat from the fridge.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.111
- What's wrong with that?

30:52.154 --> 30:54.548
- Yeah.
- She's vegan.

30:57.725 --> 30:59.901
- How long have you
even been vegan?

30:59.945 --> 31:01.511
- That's not the point.

31:01.555 --> 31:06.516
- Geese, you guys are, all
you vegans are so annoying.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.389
You think you're so much
better than everyone else.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.870
Always telling us how to live
our lives just because what,

31:13.436 --> 31:15.961
you care about animals and you
eat kale and you drink water

31:16.004 --> 31:18.833
with little bits of
fruit in it, and you kiss

31:18.877 --> 31:20.487
your puppies in the
mouths and shit.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.576
You have a leather skirt on.

31:22.619 --> 31:24.926
This is all just a
big food conspiracy.

31:26.623 --> 31:27.711
- But you didn't
have to trick me.

31:27.755 --> 31:28.974
I trusted you.

31:30.410 --> 31:31.498
- Who told you to trust me?

31:31.541 --> 31:32.760
You don't even know me.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.371
Ya'll are so dramatic man.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.765
I wish we could just take all
the vegans, put you in a huge

31:37.808 --> 31:39.810
meat grinder, make
little sliders,

31:39.854 --> 31:43.510
put some Saracha on there, and
just end the world of vegans,

31:43.553 --> 31:45.555
and make the world
so much better.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.731
God, I need some
cocaine, are you down?

31:48.689 --> 31:49.429
Alright.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.610
- Yo, fuck that guy,
he's such a dick.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.699
Hey yo, this is your chance.

31:58.742 --> 31:59.526
I brought her for you, finesse.

32:01.354 --> 32:02.616
- Yeah, yeah--

32:02.659 --> 32:05.271
- Hey man, you're just
gonna make her smile

32:05.314 --> 32:07.229
and she's yours.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.188
Watch this and take notes.

32:17.805 --> 32:20.112
Hey girl, you know why
vegans give good hud.

32:21.374 --> 32:22.679
- What?

32:22.723 --> 32:24.986
- 'Cause they like
eating these nuts.

32:29.643 --> 32:31.079
- Where's the bathroom?

32:31.123 --> 32:33.038
- I think down that hallway.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.870
- It wasn't that bad.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.089
- I thought it was good.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.573
- This
is a special report.

32:46.616 --> 32:48.967
- It is going to be a
heavy downpour over here.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.926
Can you hear me
buys, over there?

32:53.058 --> 32:55.016
Can you hear me, yes?

32:56.539 --> 32:59.281
Things are getting very
dangerous with all this rain.

32:59.325 --> 33:02.023
Everybody must stay inside.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.285
Ugh, can you feel it?

33:03.329 --> 33:06.897
I can't, no, this is
gonna ruin my makeup.

33:06.941 --> 33:09.900
I can't work under
these conditions.

33:09.944 --> 33:13.165
Yes, yes, I know I'm still on.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.951
Yes, I get it.

33:16.995 --> 33:17.996
Live television.

33:19.432 --> 33:22.957
Mud slide warnings are in
full effect in Hollywood

33:23.001 --> 33:24.306
till morning.

Make sure to stay hydrated,
drink lots of water,

33:26.395 --> 33:28.528
stay safe, and good luck.

33:30.095 --> 33:30.921

33:33.185 --> 33:35.622
- Alright, fuck it.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.624
Let's get fucked up.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.321
Let's go, I agree.

33:39.365 --> 33:40.670
- What is that?

33:40.714 --> 33:41.454
- It's coke.

33:41.497 --> 33:42.846
- Um, no it's not.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.370
That's not what coke looks like.

33:45.980 --> 33:46.763
- What?

33:48.678 --> 33:52.334
- Oh my God, you really don't
know what coke looks like?

33:52.378 --> 33:54.249
Are you poor?

33:55.381 --> 33:56.904
- Okay, I'm not poor.

33:56.947 --> 34:00.038
Maybe in L.A., but
anywhere else I'd be good.

34:01.648 --> 34:03.693
- Help him out, I'm not sharing.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.350
- Try some of my shit.

34:08.393 --> 34:09.569
It's good.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.658

36:20.134 --> 36:21.657
Who said you have to trust me?

36:26.184 --> 36:27.185
Young C, is that you?

36:29.535 --> 36:32.233
Hey, I'm really not

36:32.277 --> 36:33.408
I say we go.

Don't be playing with me,

36:43.462 --> 36:44.245
Ted?

36:46.204 --> 36:48.031
Fuck you, Ted!

37:00.000 --> 37:01.131
- Definitely Donald Glover.

37:02.307 --> 37:05.614
- Wait, you would
kill Donald Glover?

37:05.658 --> 37:09.139
- Yeah, I just get a weird
vibe from him, you know?

37:09.183 --> 37:11.707
- How does Jambino,
are you crazy?

37:11.751 --> 37:15.276
- Okay, so you're left with
Zac Effron and Ryan Reynolds.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.973
- Have you guys seen April?

37:17.017 --> 37:20.977
- You don't marry Zac Effron
because a man with those abs

37:21.021 --> 37:22.283
cannot be trusted.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.633
- Hello, what are you doing?

37:24.677 --> 37:26.113
- We're playing
fuck, marry, kill.

37:26.156 --> 37:29.116
And this dude said he would
kill Challish Bambino.

37:29.159 --> 37:33.903
- Whoa, you don't ever
kill Challish Bambino.

37:33.947 --> 37:38.256
He's like, America's
most precious gift.

37:38.299 --> 37:41.259
I don't know, he
just seems wack.

37:41.302 --> 37:42.869
- Really?

37:42.912 --> 37:44.784
You better take that back.

37:44.827 --> 37:49.223
Donald Glover is a
national treasure.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.965
- You're not even American.

37:52.008 --> 37:54.968
What, you're from some wack
butt fuck Euro country?

37:59.668 --> 38:02.323
- Yo, I want in on this.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.325
Hey pretty boy, where you going?

38:04.369 --> 38:05.239
You're in on this too.

38:09.199 --> 38:10.549
- Where the fuck have you been?

38:10.592 --> 38:12.420
- Lost my damn lighter.

38:12.464 --> 38:14.335
Been looking for it everywhere.

38:14.379 --> 38:15.467
Ya'll didn't hear me yelling?

38:15.510 --> 38:19.035
- Huh, you're so
gay, you'd fuck Zac.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.168
- What, dude.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.300
I only had those options.

38:22.343 --> 38:23.518
It was all guy--

38:29.045 --> 38:30.830
- Zac, your abs!

38:32.353 --> 38:35.225
- No, no, no, I'm
not gay or nothing.

38:36.618 --> 38:38.359
But, I beat the pussy up.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.230
Fuck gay people, am I right?

38:42.145 --> 38:44.147
- Not cool at all.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.540
- Yeah dude, what's your issue?

38:45.584 --> 38:49.239
- No, no, no, I mean I love
gay people, I love 'em.

38:49.283 --> 38:52.155
- Yeah, yeah, so
you love me, huh?

38:52.199 --> 38:53.069
- Well--

38:53.113 --> 38:54.854
- Yeah, you wanna fuck me.

38:54.897 --> 38:57.770
- Yo--

38:58.597 --> 39:00.250
- I'm gay, nigga.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.383
What, you've never seen a
gay dude that will stomp

39:02.427 --> 39:04.298
your punk ass out?

39:04.342 --> 39:06.300
Why you think they
call me Squeeze?

39:07.257 --> 39:08.737
Check him out, man,
look at his face.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.696
I'm fucking with you, dude?

39:10.739 --> 39:13.742
Everybody gotta stop
being so goddamn soft.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.222
I'm the gay one.

39:15.265 --> 39:17.224
Hey, but if you do say
some more stupid shit

39:17.267 --> 39:18.356
I'm gonna fuck you up.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.101
You had my shit, nigga?

39:27.495 --> 39:28.322
- Oh!

39:29.976 --> 39:31.369
- Finally, dude.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.632
Do you mind?

39:33.675 --> 39:36.417
- Nah, man, you're going
in some good stuff here.

39:36.461 --> 39:37.636
- Thank you.

39:37.679 --> 39:38.463
- Oh!

39:40.029 --> 39:42.162
- That's a healthy
portion right there!

39:42.205 --> 39:43.424
- That's some good shit, man!

39:43.468 --> 39:44.338
- Yes it is.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.035
- Okay, excuse me.

39:46.079 --> 39:47.950
We're gonna do this
thing real quick.

39:47.994 --> 39:48.777
- What are we doing?

39:50.475 --> 39:52.781
- Bear Squad, what's up?

39:52.825 --> 39:54.000
- Whoa, down a notch.

39:54.043 --> 39:54.696
You want them to
believe you out there.

39:54.740 --> 39:55.610
Tone it down.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.439
- You telling me
how to vlog, bro?

39:58.483 --> 39:59.353
- Yeah.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.442
- Aiite, aiite, you know what?

40:01.486 --> 40:02.487
Maybe you're right.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.184
Imma tone it down.

40:04.227 --> 40:06.665
Buh, buh, buh, buh Bear Squad.

40:06.708 --> 40:10.408
Yeah, what's up yo!

40:10.451 --> 40:12.453
What the hell is that?

40:13.541 --> 40:16.370
Yo, alright, more for me!

40:20.374 --> 40:24.204
Ugh, God, fire!

41:07.552 --> 41:09.205
- You can not die in 2018.

41:10.032 --> 41:11.904
2017 was a horrible movie year.

41:13.296 --> 41:14.472
Get Out was dope.

41:24.307 --> 41:25.744
Okay, think, think,
think, think.

41:25.787 --> 41:27.833
Okay, this is the part of
the movie where something

41:27.876 --> 41:29.704
random happens and
you get to escape.

41:34.056 --> 41:36.058
Oh, fuck!

42:04.565 --> 42:07.394
- Fuck, fuck, fuck,
this is too much.

42:07.437 --> 42:09.048
This is way too much.

42:09.091 --> 42:10.919
- Hey, hey, champ, champ,
champ, what's going on?

42:10.963 --> 42:11.746
Talk to me.

42:14.009 --> 42:15.576
- Okay, what if you were
put in the position where,

42:15.620 --> 42:17.447
nah, never mind.

42:17.491 --> 42:20.059
- Wait, wait, wait,
why are you up?

42:20.102 --> 42:22.148
Calm down, spit it out.

42:22.191 --> 42:23.410
You look stressed.

42:23.453 --> 42:25.847
- Alright, bro.

42:25.891 --> 42:27.588
Look--

42:27.632 --> 42:29.808
- Just talk to me, it's cool.

42:31.070 --> 42:33.855
- I'm following way too
many people on Instagram

42:33.899 --> 42:35.161
and it is killing me.

42:35.204 --> 42:36.728
The people I follow,
they don't even post.

42:36.771 --> 42:39.295
And I want to unfollow them,
but is it fucked up to do that?

42:39.339 --> 42:41.123
- Are you fucking serious?

42:41.167 --> 42:43.604
- Yo, I had the
same problem, man.

42:43.648 --> 42:46.607
But now, I only
follow one person.

42:46.651 --> 42:48.740
Drives bitches crazy.

42:48.783 --> 42:50.568
- Guys!

42:50.611 --> 42:52.570
- April, where are you?

42:52.613 --> 42:54.180
- There's a dead girl.

42:55.181 --> 42:57.226
- Let me know how that goes.

42:57.270 --> 42:58.576
I'm good right here.

43:30.651 --> 43:33.915
- Yo, that's what a dead
body really looks like?

43:35.830 --> 43:38.267
- Yo champ, you ain't
gotta be here for this.

43:40.008 --> 43:41.314
- Nah, I'm good.

43:41.357 --> 43:42.532
I swear, I'm good.

43:42.576 --> 43:44.796
I just can't breathe.

43:44.839 --> 43:45.623
I'm good, I'm good though.

43:46.928 --> 43:48.582
- Dre, right?

43:48.626 --> 43:50.105
Why don't you call 911, see
if you can get the ambulance

43:50.149 --> 43:51.629
over here, immediately.

43:51.672 --> 43:54.370
- Well wait, are you
sure that's a good idea?

43:54.414 --> 43:56.546
If the cops show up, we could
all probably get arrested

43:56.590 --> 43:58.592
for something.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.681
- Yeah, we three niggas
and a dead white girl.

44:00.725 --> 44:01.900
I can't go to jail.

44:01.943 --> 44:03.205
There's niggas like him in jail.

44:03.249 --> 44:04.685
Look at him and look at me.

44:04.729 --> 44:05.555
- Just go.

44:09.647 --> 44:10.560
- Yo man, he right.

44:10.604 --> 44:11.605
This shit is fucked.

44:12.693 --> 44:14.695
Who you think did this shit?

44:14.739 --> 44:15.478
- I don't even know.

44:15.522 --> 44:16.915
- Bitch, get up!

44:16.958 --> 44:18.699
- About that, yeah, she's dead.

44:18.743 --> 44:20.353
- No she's not.

44:20.396 --> 44:21.876
She just wants attention.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.053
She's just an attention whore
like the rest of you guys.

44:25.097 --> 44:26.533
What, fake ass blood you got.

44:26.576 --> 44:27.621
Look at this.

44:30.406 --> 44:33.845
Oh shit, no that's real, that...

44:39.372 --> 44:42.027
- Hey, let me go take the load
off me and lay him down, man.

44:47.685 --> 44:48.729
- You okay?

44:50.252 --> 44:51.253
- Huh, yeah.

44:51.297 --> 44:52.037
- You sure?

44:52.080 --> 44:52.864
- Yeah.

44:54.561 --> 44:56.171
- Let's get you up
out of here, alright?

44:56.215 --> 44:57.564
- No, I'm fine.

44:59.871 --> 45:01.786
- Look, I know
you're a strong girl.

45:01.829 --> 45:04.614
But you ain't gotta
pretend to be tough,

45:04.658 --> 45:05.877
especially right now.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.575
- Are you hitting on me?

45:08.618 --> 45:11.056
- What, no, no.

45:11.099 --> 45:12.448
- Settle down, cutie.

45:12.492 --> 45:13.928
It was a joke.

45:13.972 --> 45:15.887
And you don't do
it for me anyways.

45:17.802 --> 45:22.458
- I don't know what this is,
but this is inappropriate.

45:22.502 --> 45:23.459
- Oh yeah?

45:23.503 --> 45:25.679
- Given a girl's
situation, yeah.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.681
- Oh yeah, a girl is dead,
we don't know who did it.

45:27.725 --> 45:31.729
And there's nothing we
can do to bring her back.

45:31.772 --> 45:32.904
- Did you know her?

45:32.947 --> 45:33.731
- No.

45:34.688 --> 45:37.038
- Neither did I.

45:37.082 --> 45:39.519
Somebody must have
really hated her.

45:39.562 --> 45:41.739
This doesn't bother you?

45:42.827 --> 45:43.828
- No.

45:46.178 --> 45:48.180
- Then what does?

45:48.223 --> 45:49.572
- Boring.

45:50.704 --> 45:52.184
Well, that and
then fuck face Ted.

45:52.227 --> 45:54.055
He's such a piece of shit.

45:54.099 --> 45:57.145
Well, wait, where is Ted?

45:57.189 --> 45:58.712
- Good question.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.975
- Anybody seen Ted?

46:01.019 --> 46:04.805
- Hey, what's good my Teddy
Bears, we out here right now

46:04.849 --> 46:08.504

46:08.548 --> 46:09.941
What's up ya'll,

46:09.984 --> 46:11.812
What's good, we having an

46:11.856 --> 46:12.900
- Where have you been?

46:12.944 --> 46:14.119
- You're asking me
where I've been?

46:14.162 --> 46:15.424
Man, I've been around.

46:15.468 --> 46:16.817
I'm chilling, I'm
in the universe.

46:16.861 --> 46:18.166
I'm existing right now.

46:18.210 --> 46:20.255
It's crazy because--
- You are coked out.

46:20.299 --> 46:22.388
- Bitch, I am not coked out.

46:22.431 --> 46:23.693
You're coked out, alright?

46:23.737 --> 46:25.739
- It's all over
your face, dumb ass.

46:27.654 --> 46:29.482
- Okay, I'm coked out, and?

46:29.525 --> 46:30.744
We are having a party, right?

46:30.788 --> 46:35.009
- Wait, who does
blow by themselves?

46:36.054 --> 46:36.837
- Him.

46:37.882 --> 46:40.754
- I wasn't by myself, stupid.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.496
I was chilling in a room
with a whole bunch of people,

46:43.539 --> 46:46.151
and yo, what happened?

46:46.194 --> 46:49.023
- I'm gonna go check up on that
kid that I asked to go call

46:49.067 --> 46:49.850
911, alright, I'll be back.

46:50.851 --> 46:52.635
- Is she dead?

46:52.679 --> 46:53.549
Is this for real?

46:54.376 --> 46:55.160
- Oh, shut up.

46:57.902 --> 46:59.686
- Dre, any word?

46:59.729 --> 47:00.426
- There's a problem.

47:00.469 --> 47:01.514
There is no signal.

47:03.864 --> 47:05.300
- Have you gone outside?

47:05.344 --> 47:06.388
- That's the other thing.

47:06.432 --> 47:07.868
All the doors are locked.

47:07.912 --> 47:09.783
I was gonna try to go down
the street to get service,

47:09.827 --> 47:11.002
I could not find a way out.

47:20.315 --> 47:22.796
- Oh my God.

47:24.058 --> 47:25.886
This is gonna be delicious.

47:29.150 --> 47:30.717
It's okay.

47:30.760 --> 47:31.587
I don't bite.

47:32.806 --> 47:34.895
I know you don't have service.

47:34.939 --> 47:37.419
You know it's okay
for people to talk.

47:37.463 --> 47:38.290
- Okay, fine.

47:39.508 --> 47:40.727
You want some help with that?

47:40.770 --> 47:44.426
- No thanks, I'm good.

47:44.470 --> 47:45.819
This is like art.

47:46.907 --> 47:48.909
This is like making love.

47:48.953 --> 47:52.957
Every blunt and joint I
roll, I roll it differently.

47:54.872 --> 47:56.874
Sometimes you gotta
take your time

47:56.917 --> 47:59.398
and lick it slowly.

48:00.965 --> 48:02.357
Those are the special ones.

48:03.576 --> 48:05.491
And there's ones where
you gotta be quick.

48:05.534 --> 48:08.755
Aggressive, spit on it.

48:08.798 --> 48:10.191
Slap it together.

48:11.192 --> 48:12.585
those are the wild ones.

48:13.891 --> 48:16.850
But in the end, it takes
you where you need to go.

48:17.938 --> 48:19.940
- Okay, pause.

48:19.984 --> 48:21.724
Are we still talking
about rolling?

48:22.943 --> 48:26.947
- Three, two, one,
and we're sober.

48:26.991 --> 48:28.470
No we're not, she's dead, wow.

48:28.514 --> 48:30.559
This is crazy, one more time.

48:30.603 --> 48:33.998
One, two, three, sobriety.

48:34.041 --> 48:35.303
Let's vlog, okay.

48:35.347 --> 48:36.914
The view's about to
be crazy, ready?

48:36.957 --> 48:41.788
Dead girl in the Hill's,
here we go, #notclickbait--

48:42.876 --> 48:45.139
- No, you can't film this.

48:48.099 --> 48:50.101
- Stupid bitch, you swear
like I ain't got cameras

48:50.144 --> 48:51.406
on cameras.

48:51.450 --> 48:54.148
This is my life, I do this.

48:54.192 --> 48:55.062
- Why are you even here?

48:55.106 --> 48:57.412
Fucking no one likes you.

48:57.456 --> 49:00.067
You probably had
something to do with this.

49:00.111 --> 49:02.983
You and that idiot film
prod are the only people

49:03.027 --> 49:06.073
who weren't with
us when she died.

49:06.117 --> 49:07.727
- You know what Sky?

49:07.770 --> 49:09.859
I'm getting sick of all
your little comments, man.

49:09.903 --> 49:12.427
You always got some
dumb ass shit to say.

49:12.471 --> 49:13.994
- Oh, and what?

49:14.038 --> 49:16.475
You think I'm scared of you?

49:16.518 --> 49:17.737
Yeah, maybe you should be.

49:17.780 --> 49:20.392
Maybe you're gonna
end up just like her.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.964
- Mike, we're friends,
choke rougher.

49:29.314 --> 49:30.924
- Imma fuck you up.
- Pussy.

49:34.710 --> 49:36.669
- And then I gave
her this emoji.

49:36.712 --> 49:38.410
That's my favorite emoji.

49:38.453 --> 49:39.498
- I'm good, babe.

49:40.760 --> 49:41.630
- You sure?

49:41.674 --> 49:42.675
- I'm sure, I'm too high.

49:42.718 --> 49:44.372
I like, can't do it anymore.

49:47.897 --> 49:49.682
You think everyone's
okay over there?

49:50.857 --> 49:53.686
- Yeah, probably
some fucked up joke.

49:55.470 --> 49:56.254
You good?

49:57.211 --> 49:58.256
Are you scared?

50:00.562 --> 50:05.045
- Not really, I mean,
maybe a little scared.

50:05.089 --> 50:07.743
- Nothing's gonna happen to you.

50:07.787 --> 50:08.962
- So that's a promise?

50:09.006 --> 50:11.965
- Nah, I don't promise anything.

50:12.009 --> 50:14.054
You never know
what's gonna happen.

50:14.098 --> 50:15.577
I hate breaking promises.

50:16.491 --> 50:18.015
And I would hate
to let you down.

50:19.451 --> 50:22.019
But, I'm gonna go outside.

50:22.062 --> 50:25.500
I have a dope little spot where
I like to chill and smoke.

50:25.544 --> 50:27.024
- Am I boring you that much?

50:27.067 --> 50:30.288
- I like looking at the stars.

50:30.331 --> 50:31.550
- Come on, are you serious?

50:31.593 --> 50:32.855
There's no stars in L.A.

50:33.987 --> 50:36.207
- We're all fucking stars, baby.

50:48.654 --> 50:50.090
- Are you good?

50:50.134 --> 50:53.093
- Oh shit, I still
have my sunglasses on.

50:53.137 --> 50:55.313
I winked.

50:55.356 --> 50:57.445
I doubt you could see it.

51:00.187 --> 51:01.754
Sorry about that.

51:01.797 --> 51:04.017
I'll be outside if
you need anything.

51:05.540 --> 51:09.892
- I'll just be here by myself
waiting for Ryder, I guess.

51:11.155 --> 51:13.026
You think I have a
chance with that guy?

51:14.158 --> 51:15.115
- You're hot.

51:15.159 --> 51:16.682
He's really hot.

51:16.725 --> 51:17.509
Why not?

51:20.251 --> 51:22.992
- Babe, you still
have sun glasses on.

51:23.036 --> 51:23.776
- Oh.

51:26.170 --> 51:26.953
- You know what?

51:26.996 --> 51:28.041
I'm gonna make a drink.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.390
Do you want anything?

51:29.434 --> 51:31.044
- Nah, I'm good.

51:31.088 --> 51:33.046
I'll be outside if
you need anything.

51:39.748 --> 51:41.924
- Yo, what the
fuck are you doing?

51:43.230 --> 51:44.144
Come on, man.

51:44.188 --> 51:44.971
Don't do this.

51:45.014 --> 51:45.972
I didn't kill that slut.

51:46.015 --> 51:47.669
- We don't know that.

51:47.713 --> 51:50.759
- This should keep you
from doing anything stupid

51:50.803 --> 51:53.110
while we figure out
what's going on.

51:53.153 --> 51:54.067
- Well, it was probably Angelo.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.155
That dude is weird.

51:55.199 --> 51:56.200
I had nothing to do with it.

51:56.243 --> 51:57.549
I didn't touch that girl.

51:59.333 --> 52:01.466
I want a trial by combat.

52:01.509 --> 52:03.120
- That's not a TV show, idiot.

52:04.208 --> 52:05.557
- What if it is?

52:05.600 --> 52:07.820
What if this is some weird
experiment, you know?

52:07.863 --> 52:10.953
What if this is like a game
to see who's gonna survive?

52:10.997 --> 52:13.042
- What if, what if,
what if, what if?

52:13.086 --> 52:15.175
- She just hit me!

52:15.219 --> 52:16.481
Burns bitch is crazy.

52:16.524 --> 52:17.525
She's probably the
one that did it!

52:17.569 --> 52:19.484
What, what are you doing?

52:19.527 --> 52:21.616
Yo, chill out, man.

52:21.660 --> 52:25.185
Look, seriously, earlier I
was looking at my footage

52:25.229 --> 52:29.146
, bitch!

52:30.147 --> 52:32.845
God I hate you so fucking much.

52:35.848 --> 52:36.631
Fuck!

53:03.310 --> 53:05.399
- Just make him a drink.

53:05.443 --> 53:07.184
Like, just make him a drink.

53:17.455 --> 53:20.545
How is there no fucking service?

53:20.588 --> 53:22.938
This is insane, goddammit.

53:26.246 --> 53:31.164
Like, I literally can't,
oh fuck, shit, goddammit.

53:34.820 --> 53:37.431
Are you fucking kidding me?

53:37.475 --> 53:39.085
This is a joke.

53:39.128 --> 53:41.087
This is literally a joke.

53:41.130 --> 53:41.914
Oh my God.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.007
Come on.

55:08.696 --> 55:10.959
♪ Die for the titty man

55:11.003 --> 55:12.265
♪ Die for the titty man

55:12.309 --> 55:13.658
♪ Die for the titty man

55:13.701 --> 55:15.442
♪ Titty man

55:15.486 --> 55:18.358
♪ Die for the titty man

55:18.402 --> 55:20.360
- Fuck, there's
still no service.

55:24.669 --> 55:26.279
Yo Squeeze, is that you?

55:30.501 --> 55:32.764
Yo look man, I'm sorry about
that shit I said earlier.

55:32.807 --> 55:34.156
I didn't mean it.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.332
Don't play with me though.

55:38.378 --> 55:39.553
Hey yo, Squeeze.

55:40.902 --> 55:42.817
Yo, yo, hello, I'm
cool man, fuck this.

55:50.521 --> 55:52.914
Yo, I, I can't be here.

55:52.958 --> 55:54.089
Someone call 911.

55:54.133 --> 55:55.395
Get the cops over here now.

55:55.439 --> 55:57.702
- We can not call anybody.

55:57.745 --> 55:59.007
No body has service.

55:59.051 --> 56:00.400
And we can't get
the ambulance here

56:00.444 --> 56:01.358
because there's a flood warning.

56:01.401 --> 56:04.012
- Why are all the doors locked?

56:04.056 --> 56:05.405
I don't want to do this anymore.

56:05.449 --> 56:07.320
I can't be here.

56:07.364 --> 56:10.367
- Just calm down.

56:10.410 --> 56:12.630
- Calm down, the fuck calm down.

56:12.673 --> 56:15.372
There's a dead body.

56:15.415 --> 56:17.156
- Yeah, we can see that.

56:27.558 --> 56:28.385
- What?

56:29.386 --> 56:30.299
Oh shit.

56:31.475 --> 56:33.390
- How the fuck did
you get outside?

56:34.347 --> 56:39.352
- What, what the fuck
is going on here?

56:39.396 --> 56:41.267
- Dude, Ted had to
be telling the truth.

56:41.310 --> 56:43.095
He couldn't have
killed that girl.

56:43.138 --> 56:44.488
- Did you see anything?

56:44.531 --> 56:47.404
- Nah, I was just chilling.

56:48.709 --> 56:50.189
I asked her if she wanted to
have a smoke session outside.

56:50.232 --> 56:51.930
- Let's get out of here do do,

56:51.973 --> 56:53.453
you should probably be outside.

56:53.497 --> 56:55.150
- Doors are locked.

56:55.194 --> 56:58.415
It's clear that somebody
doesn't want us to leave.

56:58.458 --> 57:00.373
- How do you know that?

57:00.417 --> 57:01.722
- Two words.

57:01.766 --> 57:02.897
Common sense.

57:05.117 --> 57:05.900
- Dammit.

57:16.171 --> 57:19.305
- Whoever you are, we got money.

57:19.348 --> 57:21.089
- Shit, ya'll got money?

57:21.133 --> 57:22.395
I ain't got shit.

57:22.439 --> 57:23.701
Okay, okay, now that
Trump's president,

57:23.744 --> 57:25.877
I have no health insurance.

57:25.920 --> 57:28.488
I swear to God, if I get
Chlamydia one more time,

57:28.532 --> 57:30.403
my dick will fall off.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.710
- Wait, who are you again?

57:32.753 --> 57:34.015
- Yeah, mother fucker.

57:34.059 --> 57:35.321
I thought you were
the next chosen one,

57:35.364 --> 57:37.541
like Kendra Morrison.

57:37.584 --> 57:38.498
- Get the fuck out of here, man.

57:38.542 --> 57:40.282
I still live at my mom's.

57:41.545 --> 57:43.285
- Yo, why can't we just
break these windows?

57:43.329 --> 57:45.810
- Nigga, in this
bouji ass house?

57:45.853 --> 57:48.247
Them mother fuckers are
probably bullet proof,

57:48.290 --> 57:50.205
earthquake resistant...

57:52.686 --> 57:53.905
- Whatever.

57:53.948 --> 57:56.342
I am not dying here
with all ya'll.

57:56.385 --> 57:58.257
I'm finding my way out.

57:59.388 --> 58:01.042
- Smoke this.

58:01.086 --> 58:03.436
This will make you feel better.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.219
- Look.

58:05.830 --> 58:08.049
- No, no, we good, we good.

58:08.093 --> 58:11.357
Please do not be that guy
right now saying we all

58:11.400 --> 58:15.448
have to stick together
in order to survive.

58:15.492 --> 58:20.497
You are just as self-absorbed
as every single person here.

58:23.108 --> 58:25.023
What, you think I
don't see your posts?

58:25.066 --> 58:30.071
Helping the homeless,
helping the elderly, what?

58:31.551 --> 58:32.596
You think you're so much
better than us for that shit?

58:32.639 --> 58:35.076
Well, at least I
know I'm a bitch.

58:36.513 --> 58:39.951
If you really were a good person,
you wouldn't rub that shit

58:39.994 --> 58:42.693
in all our faces, and
feel a need every time

58:42.736 --> 58:46.523
you do something good to post
it all over social media.

58:48.220 --> 58:50.527
Look, I don't need ya'll help.

58:50.570 --> 58:53.704
I don't need none
of ya'll in general.

58:53.747 --> 58:56.097
And I'm gonna figure
this shit out on my own.

58:57.577 --> 58:59.536
- Listen, I get it.

59:00.667 --> 59:04.279
This house is filled with people

59:04.323 --> 59:06.499
that only care about themselves.

59:06.543 --> 59:07.326
I'm not perfect.

59:08.588 --> 59:11.069
And I'm not trying
to be your friend.

59:11.112 --> 59:13.593
And I'm not trying to
be anyone else's friend.

59:13.637 --> 59:15.639
I care about living.

59:18.076 --> 59:23.081
And if that means we gotta
get along, then so be it.

59:27.999 --> 59:29.130
- I appreciate that.

59:30.697 --> 59:34.179
But, I'm out bitches.

59:37.617 --> 59:40.098
West Side till I fucking die.

59:41.534 --> 59:42.317
- Peace.

59:50.978 --> 59:52.501
- April, where's my gun.

59:52.545 --> 59:53.894
- I think it's in
your other purse.

59:53.938 --> 59:56.854
- I told you to
always, forget it.

59:56.897 --> 59:58.464
Anyone here have a gun?

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.600
- Oh, fuck ya'll,
just 'cause I'm black?

01:00:03.643 --> 01:00:06.037
I do have my strap, but
it's in the car though.

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.867
- Yo, I'm gonna go
check up on Ted.

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.216
Dre, stay here with the girls.

01:00:11.259 --> 01:00:12.609
See if you can find
another way out.

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:14.088
- Wait, you going solo?

01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:16.569
- I will go with you.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.266
Ted is one way to appliance.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:20.007
I gotta make sure
he's still alive.

01:00:21.748 --> 01:00:23.315
- Don't die, sweetie.

01:00:23.358 --> 01:00:24.229
- Wink.

01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:26.492
- Nigga, did you just say wink?

01:00:26.535 --> 01:00:27.885
- Yeah.

01:00:27.928 --> 01:00:30.496
You can't see my wink
through the glasses.

01:00:30.539 --> 01:00:31.584
- Cool.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.411
- Hello!

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:37.068
Help!

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:45.685
- Ord.

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:46.904
- What are you doing?

01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:49.384
- I'm trying to stay high.

01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:51.648
- I need you to stay working.

01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:56.696
Ted.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:59.568
- Hey, he's still
alive, good job.

01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:04.704
- Listen, I am going
to untie you, okay?

01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:07.446
I need you to come
with the rest of us

01:01:07.489 --> 01:01:10.362
and find a way out
of here, alright?

01:01:10.405 --> 01:01:13.713
Don't be a dick to anyone.

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:15.759
I'm serious.

01:01:20.807 --> 01:01:22.287
- Thank you.

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:24.855
Okay, look, seriously,
earlier, on my camera footage,

01:01:24.898 --> 01:01:27.422
okay, there's like a guy
running around with like,

01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:29.207
a smilie face mask or something.

01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:31.731
- Sure he was.

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:33.124
- I'm serious.

01:01:33.167 --> 01:01:35.082
What do you think?

01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:35.996
- It's L.A.

01:01:38.738 --> 01:01:39.739
Seems legit, maybe not.

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:42.742
- Okay, coming from the guy
running around in the robe.

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:44.135
- It's called fuck you money.

01:01:44.178 --> 01:01:46.180
- What the hell does that mean?

01:01:46.224 --> 01:01:47.660
- That means I can do
whatever the hell I want.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.707
I can go whenever, leave
whenever, I can buy a whole

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.230
fucking restaurant
if I wanted to.

01:01:52.273 --> 01:01:55.581
I can wear this anywhere
because do it to impress me.

01:01:55.624 --> 01:01:57.365
How is that roommate
situation going?

01:01:57.409 --> 01:01:59.193
- Hey, hey, not cool.

01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:00.717
I live in Hollywood, okay?

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.674
That shit is expensive.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.067
- You depend on collab money.

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:04.721
I got the fuck you money.

01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:07.158
- Okay, well that's easy for
you to say when you're a drug

01:02:07.201 --> 01:02:09.334
dealer and you don't
have to pay taxes

01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:11.945
or do any real hard work.

01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:14.774
You think I do this
shit for a living?

01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.341
I sell this shit for fun.

01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:17.646
- Yo come on ya'll.

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:18.560
You guys can make up
when we get out of here.

01:02:18.604 --> 01:02:20.388
But we gotta go, come on.

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:26.786
- Look, I know it's a room
here with an outdoor patio.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:29.006
If we can get the door
unlocked, I can climb down

01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:29.833
and get help.

01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:34.533
- Where's Nina?

01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:36.187
- Look nigga, you
go find a window.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:37.754
We're gonna go look for Nina.

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.937
- Come on, get in,
get in, get in.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.199
- No, no, I'm with you.

01:02:48.242 --> 01:02:49.417
- Now ain't the
time for that shit.

01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:50.810
That shit is for
anybody else, get in.

01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:15.052
I came out the closet once.

01:03:15.095 --> 01:03:17.750
I damn sure ain't gonna
let it kill me now!

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:21.841
Die mother fucker!

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:24.757
Mother fucker, mother fucker!

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.237
Hey, go see who it is!

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.629
I got this punk ass!

01:03:45.473 --> 01:03:46.518
- Leave her alone.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:50.348
April, run!

01:04:04.275 --> 01:04:05.058
That's it?

01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:08.670
You blew a lobe of
one stroke to my face?

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.030
- Hey!

01:04:46.795 --> 01:04:49.276
- Dude, this house is insane.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.104
How many rooms are there are?

01:04:56.327 --> 01:04:57.545
- The door's locked.

01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:59.678
- Well, I
heard Ryder's here.

01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:02.333
- Um, okay, but like,
if Ryder's not there,

01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:03.943
who's sucking the
dick tonight guys?

01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:06.554
- I did it last time,
I'm not doing it again.

01:05:06.598 --> 01:05:07.816
- Charles.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:11.081
- Well, I don't even
see a gym in there, so--

01:05:11.124 --> 01:05:12.865
- But wait, do you guys
hear that screaming.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:15.389
- Yo, we're up here!

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.959
- Ah, it's 'cause there's a
party in your pants, right, bro?

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:25.660
- Man, if good guys can't
get in there with these...

01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:29.621
- Come on, man, do something!

01:05:29.664 --> 01:05:30.927
- I am.

01:05:34.191 --> 01:05:35.975
- Help, please help us!

01:05:37.629 --> 01:05:38.760
- That's the girls.

01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:40.501
They're on the other side.

01:05:40.545 --> 01:05:41.589
Come on, let's go.

01:05:41.633 --> 01:05:42.982
- Hey, so what man, fuck them.

01:05:43.026 --> 01:05:44.462
You guys tied me up
and left me to die.

01:05:44.505 --> 01:05:46.943
Let's just get out
while we still can.

01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:50.207
- Ted, I need you
to come with us.

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:52.470
Like, I fucking need
you to come with us.

01:05:52.513 --> 01:05:54.559
I swear to God...

01:05:54.602 --> 01:05:55.908
- Okay, okay.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.258
- I will end you myself.

01:05:58.302 --> 01:05:59.042
- Okay, relax.

01:05:59.085 --> 01:05:59.912
Let's go, chill.

01:06:02.436 --> 01:06:03.960
- Okay no, but seriously, guys.

01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:06.005
What are we gonna do
if we can't get in?

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.791
- Man, fuck that party.

01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:11.097
Listen, two chicks and the
shotgun coming with me.

01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:12.011
We going back to my place.

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:13.491
You know, more champagne...

01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:17.495
- Help us!

01:06:19.801 --> 01:06:20.585
- I got dick sucker number two!

01:06:25.155 --> 01:06:27.505
- Stop, they're gone.

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:41.084
- You just wanna give up?

01:06:41.127 --> 01:06:43.608
- No, just don't waste
your breath on something

01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:45.088
you can't control.

01:06:45.131 --> 01:06:46.219
They can't help us.

01:06:55.837 --> 01:06:56.795
I'm not like you.

01:06:58.797 --> 01:07:02.670
- Oh what, you can't have
feelings like us normal people?

01:07:02.714 --> 01:07:07.719
Is it because I'm not as
smart or as talented as you?

01:07:08.372 --> 01:07:09.460
Because I'm not famous?

01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:13.029
- No.

01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:21.124
Unlike the rest of us,
you're, you're a good person.

01:07:24.301 --> 01:07:26.042
- Come on, let's
go find the others.

01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:33.266
- Oh my God, thank
God ya'll okay.

01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:35.225
I found a way out of here,
I just gotta go get help.

01:07:35.268 --> 01:07:38.880
You're not gonna
die tonight, ya'll.

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:45.148
- You're a soft ass bitch.

01:07:50.544 --> 01:07:53.112
- Main Shark is gonna help
us track that mother fucker,

01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:55.027
alright, you go downstairs
and get the rest

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:56.115
of the girls.

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:57.551
- Alright, fine.

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:01.033
- Hey, hey bitch.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.427
Smiley face guy, yeah,
what's up, you little bitch.

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:04.341
What's up?

01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:05.646
I got this eight plan emoji.

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:06.430
What you got for me?

01:08:06.473 --> 01:08:07.344
Say something.

01:08:07.387 --> 01:08:08.606
What, come on.

01:08:15.178 --> 01:08:16.657
- Hey, what are you doing?

01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:18.006
Let them go.

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:19.660
- Hey man, this some bullshit.

01:08:19.703 --> 01:08:21.618
You gonna tie me up
and leave me to die

01:08:21.662 --> 01:08:23.142
for this bitch?

01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:25.057
My career does not
end tonight, okay?

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.537
I got so many more
videos to make

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:27.929
and lots of views to get.

01:08:27.973 --> 01:08:30.193
- You sound pathetic.

01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:33.152
- Nah bro, I just adapt.

01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:34.675
Hey, hey killer man.

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:37.069
I don't know who you are,
but I'll trade you, okay?

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.853
Her life for mine.

01:08:38.897 --> 01:08:39.984
You want her?

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:45.251
- Go, go, go!

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.189
- Why did you do that?

01:09:11.712 --> 01:09:13.932
You're not suppose to die.

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.115
- Take care of Sky for me.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:35.258
Let them go.

01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:38.261
It's just me and you.

01:09:38.304 --> 01:09:39.697
No body else needs to die.

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:48.184
- Systems offline.

01:10:02.154 --> 01:10:03.111
- Let's go, come on.

01:10:05.679 --> 01:10:07.899
There's nothing we can do.

01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:21.695
- Shark, I'll miss you.

01:10:21.739 --> 01:10:22.740
- I'll miss you too.

01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:30.356
Wait till they leave.

01:10:58.993 --> 01:11:00.168
- Why are you laughing?

01:11:01.735 --> 01:11:03.215
After all we just went through.

01:11:04.825 --> 01:11:07.175
- That wannabe
director was right.

01:11:07.219 --> 01:11:09.352
All this could
have been a movie.

01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:13.269
- You know the funny
thing about fame?

01:11:13.312 --> 01:11:17.055
Fame makes people
like you insane.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:21.668
- No, fame makes
the insane shine.

01:11:24.105 --> 01:11:26.673
- I don't know what that means.

01:11:26.717 --> 01:11:27.457
Let's just go.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.156
- I'm going back.

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:32.200
I'm not leaving him behind.

01:11:32.244 --> 01:11:33.289
But you can go.

01:11:38.381 --> 01:11:40.339
- Man they raised me
to be a better person.

01:11:41.949 --> 01:11:44.082
I can't let you go by yourself.

01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:44.865
Let's go.

01:11:51.655 --> 01:11:52.395
- Shark?

01:11:55.615 --> 01:11:57.225
- What are you doing here?

01:11:57.269 --> 01:11:58.836
- We couldn't leave without you.

01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:02.318
- Don't tell me you've been
behind this the whole time?

01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:07.410
- Huh?

01:12:08.585 --> 01:12:11.283
- Danny, machete?

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:14.373
- You guys weren't
suppose to make it back.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:20.466
I was just telling my company
here what he had to do next.

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:23.991
You see, celebrity
is an exclusive club.

01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:26.516
There can't be too many of us.

01:12:26.559 --> 01:12:30.346
At some point, we have
to thin out the herd.

01:12:32.173 --> 01:12:33.392
You know, the elite.

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:37.353
Every few years, we have
to take some of you out.

01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:40.225
That's where I come in.

01:12:41.313 --> 01:12:43.707
You see this face?

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:47.667
They didn't hire me because
I was one of Hollywood's

01:12:47.711 --> 01:12:49.321
pretty boys.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.279
- You were good, you
look good brother.

01:12:54.065 --> 01:12:55.414
- I was a gang banger.

01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:56.197
I was a fighter.

01:12:57.764 --> 01:13:00.419
They needed someone to
do their dirty work.

01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:01.725
They took me in.

01:13:01.768 --> 01:13:04.162
They put me in the movies.

01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:07.034
They gave me a lifestyle.

01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:13.606
But there's always a price
to pay, isn't there majita.

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:17.436
You think all those celebrity
deaths you hear about

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.483
and read about in the
paper are accidents?

01:13:20.526 --> 01:13:23.834
You think all those over
doses, suicides, and unsolved

01:13:23.877 --> 01:13:25.923
murders were random?

01:13:27.968 --> 01:13:32.495
No, mi amigos, we have
to keep the circle small.

01:13:34.279 --> 01:13:36.368
You ever heard of the 27 club?

01:13:37.325 --> 01:13:39.545
It's been around forever.

01:13:39.589 --> 01:13:41.460
That's our work.

01:13:41.504 --> 01:13:45.421
- But why, why us two?

01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:46.291
Why let us live?

01:13:46.334 --> 01:13:47.379
- I'm not.

01:13:50.077 --> 01:13:51.905
One of you has to
take out the other.

01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:56.780
It was going to be
my comma dare here.

01:13:56.823 --> 01:14:01.306
But now that's
gonna be up to you.

01:14:01.349 --> 01:14:06.354
Whoever survives becomes one
of us because I'm out of here.

01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.794
- Wait, when somebody dies,

01:14:10.837 --> 01:14:13.231
it's usually just
one or two people.

01:14:13.274 --> 01:14:15.233
This was a massacre.

01:14:15.276 --> 01:14:18.454
And besides, sorry baby.

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:20.456
Shark's not even a celebrity.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:26.505
- Look, the elite needs to send
a message, all those social

01:14:26.549 --> 01:14:29.029
media people, they
think they're stars now.

01:14:30.248 --> 01:14:33.120
I just had to take out
as many as possible.

01:14:33.164 --> 01:14:37.429
It'll be reported in the
morning as some random, jealous,

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:41.651
celebrity stalker murdering
everyone and a manhunt

01:14:41.694 --> 01:14:42.608
will ensue.

01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:47.395
But no one will be found
just like all the other case.

01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:51.530
- And if I take you out now?

01:14:53.184 --> 01:14:54.054
This will all end.

01:14:56.796 --> 01:14:59.103
- Do what you want esse.

01:14:59.146 --> 01:15:00.365
Me not important.

01:15:00.408 --> 01:15:02.019
I don't care.

01:15:02.062 --> 01:15:06.153
The elite will find you no
matter what happens to me.

01:15:06.197 --> 01:15:09.548
Your boy here sacrificed
himself for you two

01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:12.856
and you fucked it
up by coming back.

01:15:12.899 --> 01:15:17.904
Now, you have to
decide who's gonna live

01:15:18.688 --> 01:15:19.689
and who's gonna die.

01:15:21.081 --> 01:15:22.692
Me, I have to catch a plane.

01:15:23.736 --> 01:15:24.955
You keep the gun, esse.

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:33.398
- Am I high?

01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:35.269
Or this really just
fucking happened?

01:15:35.313 --> 01:15:37.663
- You don't actually
believe him, do you?

01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:40.884
- What are you gonna
do with the gun?

01:15:42.276 --> 01:15:43.408
- What you think?

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.541
- You good?

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.587
- Yeah, it went
straight through.

01:15:48.631 --> 01:15:50.023
- My driver should be here now.

01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:52.330
We could probably drop
you off at the hospital.

01:15:52.373 --> 01:15:53.200
- I can drive.

01:15:54.332 --> 01:15:56.160
- No, we stick together.

- What did you do with the gun?

01:16:43.424 --> 01:16:44.295
- I got rid of it.

01:16:45.252 --> 01:16:47.559
Should I have killed you both?

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:49.213
- Wait, what's wrong?

01:16:49.256 --> 01:16:50.910
Why are we not driving?

01:16:50.954 --> 01:16:51.737
- Paul.

01:18:06.769 --> 01:18:09.206
- Yo,
Labron is in LA now.

01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:11.425
Some of us don't
think he belongs.

01:18:11.469 --> 01:18:13.340
You know what needs to be done.

01:18:13.384 --> 01:18:16.604
We were gonna have them do it,
but that kamikaze's out here

01:18:16.648 --> 01:18:20.739
murdering all these wack
rappers, so he's busy.

01:18:20.783 --> 01:18:22.175
You think you can?
