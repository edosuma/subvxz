WEBVTT

00:00.990 --> 00:02.820
Oh,come on,Chelsea.

00:02.850 --> 00:04.140
Is this about money?

00:04.150 --> 00:06.420
'Cause I'd be happy to pay
the lease on your apartment.

00:06.450 --> 00:08.070
It's not about money,you ass.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.000
I just think it's ridiculous that
we're engaged and not living together.

00:11.070 --> 00:16.320
Well,excuse me for being old-fashioned, I'm
just not comfortable with us living in sin.

00:16.810 --> 00:18.390
So you think we should stop having sex?

00:18.430 --> 00:23.050
No,no,no,it's not the sin I
object to, it's the living in it.

00:23.080 --> 00:26.940
Charlie,there is no reason for me to renew the
lease on my apartment when I'm here every night.

00:26.970 --> 00:28.230
And I love having you
here every night...

00:28.260 --> 00:30.150
You going to eat your pickle?

00:31.680 --> 00:34.090
Yes,I'm going to eat my pickle.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.570
But you're almost done with your sandwich,
and your pickle's just sitting there.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.890
I like to eat it last.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.840
How very European of you.

00:45.140 --> 00:46.950
- Here's another pickle.
- Shut up.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.890
Oh,you are just so full of it!

00:49.910 --> 00:52.520
Give me one good reason why
I shouldn't be living here.

00:52.540 --> 00:53.900
I can give you several.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.810
This ought to be good.

00:56.090 --> 00:56.880
Go ahead.

00:56.910 --> 00:59.800
- Oh,you mean right now?
- Dance,monkey,dance.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.520
Okay. Well,there's the safety issue.

01:03.580 --> 01:07.960
You should keep your apartment for the same reason
that airplanes are equipped with oxygen masks,

01:07.980 --> 01:10.090
and cruise ships have life rafts.

01:10.120 --> 01:15.430
You know,if theTitanic had enough life rafts,
Leonardo and Kate would've lived happily ever after.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.850
Oops.

01:18.660 --> 01:21.120
You're comparing our
relationship to theTitanic?

01:21.160 --> 01:22.960
Rope-a-dope,rope-a-dope.

01:22.970 --> 01:25.780
No,no,no, of course not.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.180
But P.S.,that was a very romantic movie.
Thanks for making me watch it again.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.690
He's still swinging.
The kid's got heart.

01:33.150 --> 01:34.390
Where are you going?

01:34.430 --> 01:36.020
- Home!
- See?

01:36.030 --> 01:37.260
You just proved my point.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.930
Where would you go right now if
you didn't have your own apartment?

01:47.090 --> 01:50.090
I suppose you all
enjoyed listening to that.

01:50.130 --> 01:52.400
- Beg pardon?
- I enjoyed it.

Can't sleep,huh?

02:30.470 --> 02:31.770
No.

02:31.790 --> 02:35.070
This Chelsea-moving-in
thing is really bugging me.

02:35.490 --> 02:36.910
Why are you up?

02:36.920 --> 02:41.170
Well,I realized you were out here drinking yourself
into a miserable stupor over this whole situation and...

02:41.180 --> 02:44.150
I just want to be a part of that.

02:45.630 --> 02:47.490
Thanks.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.350
I hate to say it, but I
think Chelsea might be right.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.050
You don't hate to say it.

02:52.070 --> 02:53.720
Oh,did I say I hate to say it?

02:53.730 --> 02:56.020
I meant I can't wait to say it.

02:58.670 --> 03:02.540
But I did admire how you ferociously
defended an unwinnable position

03:02.550 --> 03:05.780
by comparing your
relationship to theTitanic.

03:06.130 --> 03:07.810
That was beautiful.

03:07.850 --> 03:12.360
Oh,come on, who remembers the
names of boats that don't sink?

03:12.370 --> 03:15.680
Sure,sure. I couldn't give you a
zeppelin other than theHindenburg.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.500
Still,it was not your finest moment.

03:18.530 --> 03:20.630
There was a time it would've worked.

03:20.670 --> 03:23.930
Yeah,back when you were
dating silicone simpletons.

03:25.050 --> 03:27.660
Unfortunately,Chelsea is
too smart for your crap.

03:27.670 --> 03:28.670
Yeah.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.630
And there's not an ounce
of silicone in those babies.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.590
Shoot. I owe Berta five bucks.

03:37.480 --> 03:41.510
Uh,b-but more to the point, why are
you so afraid to have her move in?

03:41.520 --> 03:43.500
I'm not afraid of her
moving in,that's easy.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.420
Moving her out's the bitch.

03:45.450 --> 03:47.510
So,you're already assuming
you're going to break up?

03:47.520 --> 03:52.280
Oh,come on, what evidence is there to
suggest that it'll end any other way?

03:52.310 --> 03:55.250
Well,I think she's capable
of a long-term commitment.

03:55.270 --> 03:58.480
And you,you could... change.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.370
You don't believe that.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.470
No,I was just trying to be supportive.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.950
Well,you're not doing a very good job.

04:03.990 --> 04:06.000
I'm not trying very hard.

04:08.700 --> 04:09.950
Let me ask you a question.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.440
What did you think was gonna happen
when you and Chelsea got married?

04:13.450 --> 04:16.360
Honestly,I never thought that far ahead.

04:16.399 --> 04:20.990
I figured we could stretch the engagement thing
out for a couple of years, and by then,who knows.

04:21.019 --> 04:24.010
Maybe I'd die, maybe she'd get fat.

04:25.540 --> 04:29.320
Well,kudos to you for not
bringing that up in the argument.

04:30.090 --> 04:32.580
It wasn't easy.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.410
You know what you have to do,don't you?

04:36.440 --> 04:39.400
I don'thaveto do anything,Alan.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.190
If not living together
is a deal breaker,

04:41.240 --> 04:45.330
then she's free to break off the
engagement and go on her merry way.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.540
She most certainly is.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.400
So you know what you have to do.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.100
Yes,I know what I have to do.

04:53.820 --> 04:55.430
Are you done torturing me?

04:55.450 --> 04:57.350
Yeah,almost.

05:00.260 --> 05:02.840
I'm the king of the world!

05:06.820 --> 05:08.960
Okay,now I'm done.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.500
Here.

05:27.590 --> 05:28.950
What's this?

05:28.980 --> 05:31.210
Alan's house key.

05:34.990 --> 05:36.650
Why?

05:36.690 --> 05:40.350
'Cause I want you to move in, and I
didn't have time to make a new one.

05:41.540 --> 05:44.820
Plus,he kind of pissed
me off last night.

05:45.450 --> 05:47.830
- You want me to move in?
- Yes.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.680
I thought about it, and you were right.

05:51.790 --> 05:55.910
Which is not to say
I was wrong, but,uh...

05:57.330 --> 06:00.210
Okay,I was wrong.

06:00.220 --> 06:02.670
You're sure you want me to move in?

06:02.700 --> 06:05.620
Absolutely not.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.410
But I figure what the hell.

06:10.450 --> 06:13.100
I mean,it's gonna happen
sooner or later,right?

06:13.530 --> 06:15.360
Oh,shut up.

06:15.390 --> 06:17.770
Come on in,I'll make some coffee.

06:24.990 --> 06:27.210
What's all this?

06:27.240 --> 06:29.610
Let's just say I had faith in you.

06:43.010 --> 06:44.770
Those go upstairs in the master bedroom.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.050
Careful, they're fragile.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.420
Okay,you and me need to talk.

06:52.460 --> 06:55.560
I know. I know. You
didn't sign up for this.

06:55.570 --> 06:59.970
You work for me,not for her, and it's bad enough
you have to put up with Zippy and the chimp.

07:01.930 --> 07:06.160
No. I like her better than you,so
from now on I'm working for her.

07:07.170 --> 07:07.880
What?

07:07.910 --> 07:11.650
You need something,you ask
her, she talks to me,we decide.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.320
I don't get a vote?

07:13.350 --> 07:16.680
Yeah,you get a vote.
One vote out of three.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.350
Good luck with that.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.910
Oh,boy.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.750
You like it?

07:40.070 --> 07:42.480
Oh,boy!

07:42.970 --> 07:45.840
Don't the colors just
liven the place up?

07:46.380 --> 07:48.310
Well...

07:48.320 --> 07:51.840
Oh,boy!

07:52.910 --> 07:55.310
Come on,I want to show you
what I did in the bathroom.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.520
Oh,boy.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.920
What do you think?

08:06.930 --> 08:09.220
I don't know.

08:09.230 --> 08:13.340
I have this sudden urge
to pee sitting down.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.050
You like the new towels?

08:16.750 --> 08:18.780
I guess.

08:18.820 --> 08:20.390
What was wrong with the old ones?

08:20.410 --> 08:22.580
They didn't match my shower curtain.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.650
What was wrong withmyshower curtain?

08:25.680 --> 08:27.440
Didn't match your towels.

08:27.460 --> 08:29.980
Maybe that's how I tell them apart.

08:32.570 --> 08:37.700
Oh,oh, please tell me that's
one of those Zen sand gardens.

08:40.380 --> 08:43.409
You know very well that's
Sir Lancelot's litter box.

08:43.450 --> 08:44.800
You brought the cat?

08:44.830 --> 08:47.280
Of course I brought the cat. What
did you think I was gonna do with him?

08:47.290 --> 08:51.130
I don't know. Return him to the wild?

08:52.370 --> 08:53.720
You're being ridiculous.

08:53.750 --> 08:57.650
Is it ridiculous to want the
turds in my bathroom to be human?

08:59.310 --> 09:02.000
Fine,we'll put it in the laundry room.

09:02.030 --> 09:04.320
Near my clean clothes? Forget it.

09:04.330 --> 09:06.060
So where am I supposed to put it?

09:06.100 --> 09:09.810
Oh,I don't think you really want
me to tell you where to put it.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.640
I'm just saying it's too much!

09:13.680 --> 09:16.870
Pillows,towels,shower curtains,cat crap!

09:16.900 --> 09:19.610
I don't like it, I don't
need it, I don't want it!

09:19.660 --> 09:21.790
What do you want me to
do,Charlie? You want me to leave?

09:21.800 --> 09:24.790
No,no,no! You just got here! I'll leave!

09:24.800 --> 09:27.980
It'll make more room for
you and Sir Crapsalot!

09:27.990 --> 09:30.420
Charlie!

09:31.930 --> 09:33.840
- Get a good earful?
- No.

09:33.850 --> 09:37.370
I did. And I don't appreciate
being called Sir Crapsalot.

09:41.990 --> 09:44.620
Oh,good. For some reason,
I can't find my house key.

09:45.820 --> 09:48.740
I hope you're happy with yourself.

09:49.060 --> 09:51.580
Why would I start now?

10:07.220 --> 10:08.540
How'd you find me?

10:08.580 --> 10:10.050
Wasn't hard.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.070
When you're not volunteering to read
stories to the elderly or feed the homeless,

10:13.100 --> 10:15.110
you're usually here.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.800
Sea breeze, extra pineapple.

10:21.150 --> 10:23.850
I'm not cut out for this
living together stuff,Alan.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.970
I mean,I tried,I really tried.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.300
That's true. You gave it a whole,uh...

10:28.760 --> 10:31.080
hour and 20 minutes.

10:31.820 --> 10:34.530
Hey,now Berta owesmefive bucks.

10:35.170 --> 10:38.870
Charlie,it's not really that
difficult to live with a woman.

10:38.890 --> 10:41.580
Says the man who's
been thrown out twice.

10:41.610 --> 10:44.120
I didn't say it wasn't hard for them.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.830
Did you see the salt and pepper
shakers Chelsea put in the kitchen?

10:48.840 --> 10:50.120
No.

10:50.170 --> 10:55.440
They're like these foot-high ceramic roosters
with little S and P holes in their beaks.

10:55.470 --> 10:58.400
Cute. I think I saw those in
the Williams-Sonoma catalog.

10:59.460 --> 11:00.710
What am I freaking out about?

11:00.730 --> 11:03.690
A woman's been living
with me for six years.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.800
Cheap shot. Canned pineapple?

11:12.280 --> 11:14.600
It's not just the salt shakers.

11:14.640 --> 11:18.410
It's the fancy pillows on the bed,
the fruity towels in the bathroom,

11:18.450 --> 11:20.220
and then there's the
clothes and the shoes.

11:20.250 --> 11:24.490
Oh,my God,the shoes. She's
got almost as many as I do!

11:25.750 --> 11:30.570
And lest we forget, she brought her
big,fat, pooping cat to live with us.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.900
As opposed to what,
having it put to sleep?

11:33.910 --> 11:36.900
I suggested letting it go.
I didn't even think of that.

11:38.180 --> 11:42.100
The cat aside,you do know it was
wrong to storm out the way you did.

11:42.140 --> 11:45.090
Of course I know. I'm
an ass,not an idiot.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.890
One does not preclude the other.

11:49.010 --> 11:53.890
You realize this has nothing to do with the
cat or the towels or the pillows,don't you?

11:55.300 --> 11:58.780
Tell you what. Here's 20 bucks.

11:58.790 --> 12:01.390
Don't tell me what it's really about.

12:02.200 --> 12:06.080
Boy, you're putting me in
a tough spot here,Charlie.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.630
- 40.
- Good night.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.900
Nah,I care too much
about you two kids. Here.

12:13.910 --> 12:16.160
Now,the reason you panicked is that...

12:16.190 --> 12:17.950
This is just 20.

12:17.980 --> 12:21.890
Is it? My mistake.

12:26.640 --> 12:32.780
The reason you panicked and ran away is that
you recognize that the old Charlie is dying.

12:33.120 --> 12:38.010
But what you have to understand is, he has
to die in order for a new Charlie to be born.

12:38.570 --> 12:40.450
Well,that makes sense.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.290
- Let me ask you a question.
- Of course.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.730
Does the new Charlie
still have the old brother?

12:46.550 --> 12:48.910
Absolutely,and he's here for you.

12:48.940 --> 12:51.450
Man,I can't catch a break.

12:53.700 --> 12:56.680
So,how pissed off was
Chelsea when I left?

12:56.850 --> 12:59.060
It was pretty bad at first.

12:59.090 --> 13:03.430
Did you really suggest that she do something
anatomically impossible with the kitty litter box?

13:03.440 --> 13:05.160
I didn't suggest anything.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.610
She may have inferred.

13:08.110 --> 13:11.200
Well,regardless,I think I may have been
able to smooth it over for you a little bit.

13:11.230 --> 13:12.590
Really? What'd you say?

13:12.600 --> 13:17.190
Uh,I said you had the emotional maturity of a
nine year-old,and that she had to make allowances.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.190
That's good. That's
good. Make it her fault.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.310
So now all you have to do is go home,

13:24.340 --> 13:28.950
admit that you're a frightened little man who
doesn't deserve her love, and beg for her forgiveness.

13:29.890 --> 13:32.120
Groveling comes easy for you,doesn't it?

13:32.160 --> 13:35.130
Not at first. I didn't really hit
my stride till my second marriage.

13:36.940 --> 13:39.350
Oh,by the way,have you
seen my house key anywhere?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.470
Nope.

13:44.750 --> 13:48.180
Oh,Chelsea,I was such a fool.

13:50.390 --> 13:53.680
Thank God my brother
talked some sense into me.

13:54.480 --> 13:57.420
Oh,Charlie, I love your brother.

13:57.440 --> 14:03.800
He's so smart and masculine, and yet,his
femine side makes him sensitive and intuitive.

14:04.950 --> 14:07.980
You're right. I only tease
him 'cause I'm jealous.

14:08.330 --> 14:10.830
And secretly gay.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.300
Oh,hello.

14:18.330 --> 14:19.600
Don't worry.

14:19.630 --> 14:23.440
This ain't the most embarrassing
thing I ever walked in on you doing.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.680
Oh,yeah. Thanks for not
making a big thing about that.

14:27.690 --> 14:29.980
Right back at ya.

14:33.650 --> 14:36.820
You know, I really should cut
down on the talking to myself.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.180
Yes,you should. It's
getting a little weird.

14:47.890 --> 14:50.440
Son of a bitch!

14:51.210 --> 14:54.200
Can I say I'm sorry again,
or are you sick of it?

14:54.210 --> 14:56.150
Say it again. Let's see.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.070
I'm sorry.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.590
Nope. Still fun.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.670
And?

15:03.700 --> 15:06.410
And... I'm a big, stupid jerk.

15:06.420 --> 15:07.970
And?

15:08.010 --> 15:13.370
And I'd really like to go upstairs
and finish this apology with my mouth.

15:17.820 --> 15:20.430
Charlie,a moment?

15:21.320 --> 15:22.730
Not now,Alan.

15:22.750 --> 15:26.660
Uh,yeah,well, there's a bit of a situation,
and I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist.

15:27.350 --> 15:28.660
I'd better talk to him.

15:28.690 --> 15:31.240
He's about to go full fruit fly.

15:34.930 --> 15:36.150
What is your problem?

15:36.180 --> 15:37.960
Well,I noticed you put a
lot of stuff in my room,

15:37.980 --> 15:40.450
and I was wondering how
long it was gonna stay there.

15:40.460 --> 15:43.080
I've been wondering the
same thing about you.

15:43.090 --> 15:44.150
Come on,Charlie.

15:44.180 --> 15:47.940
How am I supposed to live in that room if you
and Chelsea are gonna use it as a walk-in closet?

15:47.980 --> 15:49.150
Tell you what.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.620
I'll give you a break on the rent.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.700
- I haven't been paying rent.
- There it is!

15:55.200 --> 15:57.110
Fine. I'll manage somehow.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.290
- Alan,wait.
- What?

15:59.300 --> 16:02.100
- I need you to pull your car out of the garage.
- Why?

16:02.360 --> 16:05.400
You don't expect Chelsea to
park on the street,do you?

16:05.410 --> 16:06.860
So,I have to park on the street?

16:06.890 --> 16:08.360
You don't have to.

16:08.390 --> 16:09.680
You can park it at your place.

16:09.690 --> 16:12.560
- I don't have a place.
- There it is!

16:15.850 --> 16:18.090
You can leave your clicker
on the coffee table.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.340
Wait,wait,Charlie, if
I don't have a clicker,

16:20.370 --> 16:22.290
and I don't have a house key,
how am I supposed to get in?

16:22.320 --> 16:24.570
There it is!

16:32.680 --> 16:34.650
I don't have to pee.

16:39.990 --> 16:42.690
I don't have to pee.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.430
Damn it,I have to pee.

17:05.940 --> 17:07.940
Son of a bitch.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.560
Oh,ski poles!

17:42.090 --> 17:45.030
Oh,good. A litter box.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.360
This is delicious.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.580
Sure is.

17:52.630 --> 17:55.140
Glad you like it. There's plenty more.

17:58.670 --> 18:01.710
Jake,would you pass me the chicken?

18:02.930 --> 18:05.240
It's fish,Dad.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.270
Hope you're not
allergic to Sir Lancelot.

18:07.290 --> 18:10.300
I'll be fine as long as he
doesn't sleep on my face again.

18:12.110 --> 18:13.910
He is a snuggler,isn't he?

18:14.190 --> 18:18.240
Yeah. By the way,do you know if
anybody rented your old apartment yet?

18:18.250 --> 18:20.530
Actually,somebody just scooped it up.

18:21.180 --> 18:22.850
Why? Are you thinking of moving out?

18:22.860 --> 18:25.450
Well,obviously,there's not
a lot of room for me here.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.890
What's a place like that go for?

18:26.920 --> 18:28.230
$1,800 a month.

18:28.270 --> 18:30.950
On the other hand, it's
nice to be close to family.

18:31.750 --> 18:34.740
Well,you got no shame at all,do you?

18:35.450 --> 18:38.630
I assume that's a rhetorical question.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.880
Where's Uncle Charlie?

18:39.910 --> 18:41.350
Said he had some sort of meeting.

18:41.380 --> 18:43.860
That means poker or strip club.

18:48.070 --> 18:50.310
I'm sure it's poker.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.950
Ooh,pizza.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.390
Hey,Gordon,small world.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.150
Hey,Mr. Harper. What are you doing here?

19:16.160 --> 19:18.260
Oh,I just rented this place.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.820
Decided I need a weekend getaway.

19:20.830 --> 19:23.050
From Malibu?

19:24.700 --> 19:28.020
You'd be surprised. It
gets crowded sometimes.

19:28.030 --> 19:29.420
Okay.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.030
What happened to that beautiful
woman that used to lived here?

19:32.050 --> 19:35.270
She lives with me in
Malibu. We're engaged.

19:35.660 --> 19:38.680
- And you're hanging out here all alone?
- Yup.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.940
- You know what you are, Mr. Harper?
- What?

19:42.950 --> 19:44.940
A genius.

19:46.460 --> 19:49.070
- Thanks,Gordon. Good night.
- Good night.

19:52.350 --> 19:55.070
It's nice when someone gets you.
