[theme music playing]

00:48.214 --> 00:49.516
[screeching]

00:53.386 --> 00:56.356
Hmm. I should really learn to play this game.

01:05.098 --> 01:06.900
Fascinating.

01:06.966 --> 01:09.202
Hey, eight ball, what's the big idea,

01:09.269 --> 01:11.638
parking your flying tin cigar on me?

01:11.738 --> 01:16.142
Say, you wouldn't happen to be an Earth creature, by chance, would you?

01:16.242 --> 01:17.377
Of course I am.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.479
I was born and bred on Earth.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.114
Oh, what luck.

01:21.214 --> 01:22.715
Quite impressive, too.

01:22.782 --> 01:25.652
You're an absolute perfect specimen.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.320
Oh, cut it out.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.988
You're going to make me blush.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.491
Would you allow me to perform a few tests on you,

01:31.591 --> 01:33.893
Mr. Earth Creature, please?

01:33.960 --> 01:36.796
Test? Gosh, I didn't even study.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.166
Hey! What the heck is this?

01:40.266 --> 01:41.568
What are you doing?

01:49.242 --> 01:52.512
First, the molecular conductivity test.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.616
-[device whirs] -Moleculiar what?

01:58.785 --> 01:59.853
Oh, my.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.188
Very interesting reaction.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.698
Very good, earthling.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.001
Now we'll perform the elasticity sufferance test.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.979
Now the vibrato ravagization test.

02:26.045 --> 02:27.347
[device whirs]

02:31.618 --> 02:32.785
[gasps]

02:32.852 --> 02:34.821
If you could please insert this in--

02:34.888 --> 02:36.389
Not on your life, pal.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.459
Find yourself another rube to test on, 'cause I'm out.

02:40.393 --> 02:41.661
Oh, dear.

02:41.728 --> 02:44.130
We haven't even gotten to the best test yet.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.673
Oh, where did that Earth creature go?

02:53.740 --> 02:54.908
Psst.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.245
[Bugs] Over here, Mac.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.314
You're looking for Earth creatures, are you?

03:01.381 --> 03:02.916
Oh, yes, indeed, I--

03:03.016 --> 03:06.085
-[muffled] -Shh! Not so loud, Mac.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.021
I got some nice, premium

03:08.087 --> 03:10.156
Earth creature out back for you.

03:10.223 --> 03:11.491
What do you say?

03:11.558 --> 03:14.761
I would very much like that.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.062
Here you are, kid.

03:16.829 --> 03:18.031
First one's free.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.368
Oh, goody, goody.

03:22.435 --> 03:25.405
A new Earth creature to experiment on.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.276
Hmm. I don't see anything in here.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.344
[grunts]

03:34.214 --> 03:35.748
-[whistles] -[tires screech]

03:42.755 --> 03:46.125
Oh, this makes me very  furioso.

03:48.094 --> 03:51.631
I wonder if that little bowling ball phoned home yet.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.967
All right, you stubborn Earth creature,

03:54.067 --> 03:56.202
it's time to resume testing.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.139
Hold up there, broomface.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.208
You can't be doing this to people.

04:02.275 --> 04:04.577
Us earthlings, we got laws.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.479
But I'm not from Earth.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.249
-I'm from Mars. -From Mars?

04:09.315 --> 04:11.251
How do I know you're from Mars?

04:11.317 --> 04:12.719
You got any credentials?

04:12.785 --> 04:14.487
Yes, I do.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.291
Behold, my official Martian license.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.293
Let me see that.

04:20.393 --> 04:22.495
Why, this license is expired, Doc.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.464
What? Expired?

04:24.564 --> 04:27.133
Yeah. See the date? It's no good.

04:27.233 --> 04:31.170
But... but I need that to do my Martian stuff.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.939
Listen, Doc, you're in luck.

04:33.006 --> 04:36.075
We can just renew your license right here.

04:36.142 --> 04:38.111
I can give you your Martian test.

04:38.177 --> 04:40.847
I happen to be an official test giver.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.515
Oh, goody.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.852
All right. First, you got to do the written portion of the exam.

04:45.952 --> 04:49.088
Can a Martian withstand a ten-ton weight?

04:49.155 --> 04:50.256
Hmm.

04:52.525 --> 04:54.294
-[Marvin] No. -[Bugs] Great.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.695
That's one right.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.431
You're on a roll, Doc. Now for the physical test.

04:58.498 --> 04:59.532
[machine buzzes]

05:00.800 --> 05:02.869
[gasping]

05:02.969 --> 05:05.438
How long must I do this for?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.207
Eh, just keep going, Doc.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.609
I'm collecting data.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.846
[gasping]

05:20.820 --> 05:23.022
[gasping loudly]

05:26.326 --> 05:27.226
[wheezes]

05:27.327 --> 05:29.028
All right. Breathe into this.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.469
[Marvin in high-pitched voice] Did I pass yet?

05:41.140 --> 05:43.576
Now onto the final portion of the exam.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.044
The driving test.

05:46.212 --> 05:47.580
And begin.

05:55.154 --> 05:57.390
Oh, this is easy.

05:59.926 --> 06:01.594
[groans]

06:02.362 --> 06:03.396
[screams]

06:14.240 --> 06:15.408
Pencils down.

06:16.409 --> 06:17.744
Let's see how you did.

06:19.078 --> 06:21.748
[whirs and beeps]

06:21.848 --> 06:23.249
[machine] Pt-ooie.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.585
Hey, congrats, laughing boy.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.086
You passed the test.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.855
Here's your new license.

06:28.921 --> 06:31.791
[gasps] Oh, goody, goody.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.359
I'm a Martian again.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.128
I'm a Martian agai--

06:36.396 --> 06:37.296
Wait.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.133
This is an Earth license.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.469
Huh. Guess that means you're an earthling now.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.138
A what?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.372
[gasps]

06:49.475 --> 06:50.977
[alien] Bring this Earth creature

06:51.077 --> 06:53.045
back to the lab for testing.

06:53.112 --> 06:56.716
What? No! Unhand me at once!

06:59.786 --> 07:01.387
Well, I guess that's what happens

07:01.454 --> 07:03.890
when you space out during class.

07:03.956 --> 07:05.925
[chuckles]

07:05.992 --> 07:08.094
[theme music playing]

07:16.169 --> 07:18.938
Uh, hello. I would like a ba... [stuttering]

07:19.005 --> 07:22.275
I would like a ba... Yes, I'd like a... [stuttering]

07:24.477 --> 07:25.945
[screams] Baboon!

07:26.012 --> 07:27.113
[screaming]

07:27.180 --> 07:29.782
He's lucky. That was my last baboon.
