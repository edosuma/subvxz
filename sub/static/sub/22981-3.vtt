WEBVTT

00:08.010 --> 00:09.030
- Uhh!
- Arghh!

00:09.080 --> 00:11.550
- What's the matter?
- They've reopened her case.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.190
Your first wife? They
might find out who did it.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.230
Well, the saliva swab's degraded

00:16.280 --> 00:19.790
- so we can't raise a DNA profile.
- So how does it work, you protecting us?

00:19.840 --> 00:22.910
Don't worry. I'll make sure Athif
goes down for a very long time.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.910
It contains glass particles that
were on top of the blood spatter.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.960
A staged burglary?

00:28.480 --> 00:31.270
- You're hiding something.
- I resent that suggestion.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.360
Go and talk to DS Stevens.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.390
Welcome, everyone.

01:24.440 --> 01:29.190
This is the marriage of Laura
and Tim, who welcome you here.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.920
Dearly beloved, we are gathered...

01:47.060 --> 01:48.160
Get that, will you, love?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.750
Hi there. Is this the
home of Elizabeth Bancroft?

01:54.800 --> 01:56.190
Yes, it is.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.910
Well, she's not expecting me.

01:57.960 --> 02:00.000
- She's just inside.
- Thank you.

02:10.320 --> 02:14.510
All this time she was helping and didn't
mention she was mates with the murder victim?

02:14.560 --> 02:17.510
Walker said she's been jumpy about
the case from the beginning.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.550
And that she wanted me off it.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.190
Why didn't you say?

02:21.240 --> 02:22.990
I didn't think it was important.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.990
He's not objective about her.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.990
They're both up for the DCS job.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.190
Well, you can't sit on it.
You have to report it to him.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.470
He'll use it against her.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.150
Shit.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.750
Look, I know you like her. I do, too.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.790
But this is weird.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.800
She could have been in that
wedding video for any reason.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.190
Maybe it was her
sabotaging us at Mayfields.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.550
Come on, this is Bancroft we're
talking about. Why would she do that?

02:48.600 --> 02:51.210
Because she's hiding
something from her past.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.950
It happens.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.590
OK.

02:55.640 --> 03:01.230
Before we start jumping to crazy
conclusions, just... let me do some digging.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.390
So... how do you two know each other?

03:11.440 --> 03:14.830
Old... old friends. We
were at uni together.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.070
- How do you want your coffee, Mr, er...?
- Tim. Just call me Tim.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.910
Erm... white, no sugar.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.670
Thanks.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.600
- Are you on your way out?
- Oh, er... No. No, no. It can wait.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.750
You should get to footy.
There's gonna be traffic.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.150
Were you on the same course at
uni or...? How did you meet?

03:33.200 --> 03:35.190
Well, we were in halls together. Thanks.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.630
Then we were housemates till we graduated.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.880
You ought to go, Joe, really.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.670
OK. It was nice to meet you.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.920
- You, too. Good luck.
- Thank you.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.680
What are you doing here?

03:56.840 --> 03:59.440
I thought we agreed that
you wouldn't come back.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.600
They've re-opened Laura's case.

04:03.640 --> 04:07.830
This detective's been calling and
then Len Dorman showed up in London.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.270
And I thought if I didn't make
an appearance, it would look odd.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.910
- Well, they've closed it.
- What?

04:12.960 --> 04:14.200
The case. It's closed.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.560
Oh, right.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.240
I suppose I ought to be pleased. I mean...

04:22.800 --> 04:26.230
.. could have been difficult
if they dredged up what we did.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.430
Hmm. Well, everything's under control.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.440
Although it doesn't help, you...
turning up on my doorstep like this.

04:34.800 --> 04:39.150
You know, somehow... I...
I don't even know how...

04:39.200 --> 04:42.950
I've managed not to think too
much about Laura over the years.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.960
But now... I can't... stop.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.400
I keep seeing what she looked like.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.550
The blood. I just...

04:54.600 --> 04:56.390
Sorry.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.360
Obviously I...

04:59.720 --> 05:01.720
.. can't talk about this with anyone else.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.670
Have you been to see her?

05:03.720 --> 05:07.480
You mean them? Wasn't just
Laura that died that day.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.320
Well, you should go.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.920
You're right. I should go.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.710
You know, I...

05:20.560 --> 05:23.310
I don't even think I can
remember where the church is.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.070
- Tim, for Christ's sake, come on.
- Liz, please, come with me.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.960
I honestly... I can't do this on my own.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.580
Give me five minutes. I've
got to make a phone call.

05:42.780 --> 05:44.270
Lovely!

05:49.960 --> 05:51.680
Joe.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.200
Joe.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.200
Look, what you saw with me and
Andy, it's not anything, OK?

05:58.720 --> 06:00.790
Why are you sleeping together?

06:00.840 --> 06:04.550
You're in a relationship. If you can
even call it that. You know he's married?

06:04.600 --> 06:07.150
- Who told you that?
- Doesn't matter.

06:09.640 --> 06:10.960
Your mother.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.390
You know she shouldn't be
spreading station gossip.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.440
No, well, she doesn't
want to see me get hurt.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.550
OK.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.070
Me and Andy, we did have a
fling... when I first came.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.510
But... it finished. It
finished months ago.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.510
So what was that last night, then?

06:30.560 --> 06:32.870
Just stupid flirtation, nothing more.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.800
I like you a lot, so
please don't mess me around.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.190
I'm not messing you around.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.920
Promise?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.000
Promise.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.200
OK.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.790
Len's taken good care of things.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.520
I come up here, too.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.040
You know what I'm like.
I can't stand mess.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.720
Not that Laura would have cared.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.190
She liked a bit of chaos. Do you remember
how pissed she got at your wedding?

07:34.240 --> 07:36.990
We had to carry her home.
She thought it was funny.

07:37.040 --> 07:41.340
We were on an eight o'clock flight to Venice
the next morning. She wasn't laughing then.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.320
Thanks for looking after the grave.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.480
- And for coming here with me.
- Mm.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.600
There's a train back to
London at midday, so...

08:15.920 --> 08:18.320
- Mind your head.
- Where's Daddy?

08:21.080 --> 08:22.950
Is this it? I'm not
moving my son in there.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.710
- We had to move you fast.
- You're safe. That's what counts.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.230
I want to speak to Bancroft.
She said she'd be here.

08:28.280 --> 08:32.520
She'll be here soon. Come on.
Let's get you inside. Eh?

08:33.039 --> 08:34.640
Come on.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.480
27 years since I was last here.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.200
Can't believe it.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.190
- Do you ever think of leaving?
- No.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.200
No, my life's here.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.190
Get to London much?

08:55.240 --> 08:56.600
Not often.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.200
Well, if you do...

08:59.880 --> 09:01.560
we should get together.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.150
We both know that's not
a good idea, don't we?

09:05.200 --> 09:05.890
Sorry.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.430
Sorry, I've got to get this. Yep?

09:09.480 --> 09:11.080
They're in safely.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.590
She's been asking for you.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.350
Er, yeah, all right, put her on.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.480
Zaheera, it's Bancroft.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.670
Everything OK?

09:20.720 --> 09:24.150
Not really. The flat's tiny,
there's nowhere for Rahid to play.

09:24.200 --> 09:28.830
Yeah, I know. I'm looking for somewhere in
the countryside but I just needed you safe.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.470
You promised you'd be here.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.190
I've got a family situation.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.150
Er... when's Athif back?

09:34.200 --> 09:37.310
Monday. And he's gonna go mad
when he realises I've gone.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.030
He won't find you, don't worry.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.710
Will you come round?

09:40.760 --> 09:43.430
Yeah, I will... I will
when I can, I promise.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.990
But DS Bevan's gonna stay with you for
now. You've got nothing to worry about.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.560
Pop him on, will you?

09:50.120 --> 09:52.270
- Guv. - Right, I need
you to stay with her.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.670
Guv, my missus has just
come back and we were...

09:54.720 --> 09:59.000
You know what's at stake here. This is
your priority, so just get on with it.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.080
Lazy bastard.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.990
Well, wouldn't want to get
on the wrong side of you.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.960
You're damn right.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.190
Oh, I'm on the weekend shift.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.840
But I'm... I'm free tonight,
if you want me to come round?

10:16.600 --> 10:18.270
I'd love that but, erm...

10:18.320 --> 10:20.920
we'll have to see cos
I'm... I'm working too.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.750
On one of your mum's old cases, actually.

10:23.800 --> 10:28.550
She was on this investigation about
this girl called Laura Fraser.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.390
Does that ring any bells?

10:30.440 --> 10:33.390
- Is this the cold case that
you've been...? - No, no. No, no.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.760
No, no, no. We've... we've moved
on to a different one now.

10:39.120 --> 10:43.550
She's never mentioned a Laura
or a Tim Fraser to you, has she?

10:43.600 --> 10:45.480
No. Don't know any Frasers.

10:47.800 --> 10:52.560
Well, she'd have met them... years
ago. Probably before you were born.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.190
This, erm... guy came round
to the house this morning.

11:00.240 --> 11:04.320
And he said he was Mum's friend from
university. But he was called Tim.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.640
Er... I didn't get his surname.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.990
What's this about?

11:12.040 --> 11:17.910
Erm... it's, er... police protocol.
If you stay in touch with a witness,
then you should declare it.

11:17.960 --> 11:22.600
OK, well, if it was him, she hasn't stayed
in touch. He just appeared out of nowhere.

11:27.880 --> 11:32.670
OK, you've got ten minutes.
You should easily catch it.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.370
You are keen to get rid of me.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.310
Well, it's best for both of us.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.750
We acted like idiots after Laura died.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.390
We didn't do anything wrong.

11:42.440 --> 11:46.270
We slept together, Tim. The night of
the funeral, we fucked. We kept fucking.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.830
- There's no need to put it like that.
- What were we thinking?

11:48.880 --> 11:51.470
Anyway, does it really
matter now the case is closed?

11:51.520 --> 11:52.800
Yes. Yes, it matters.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.750
It could ruin both of our...
professional reputations.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.400
- I suppose you're right.
- I know I'm right.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
So, please, Tim, just go.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.360
You split with Brian, didn't you?

12:09.960 --> 12:11.960
Do you get lonely?

12:14.280 --> 12:16.080
I focus on my work.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.070
I've got Joe.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.360
I've got a daughter now. Amber.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.830
Sometimes I worry that...

12:23.880 --> 12:27.480
well, that... we're almost... too close.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.880
Dependent on each other.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.480
- Does Amber have a mum?
- Freya.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.990
Are you together?

12:39.040 --> 12:40.430
Just.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.480
It's not been easy.

12:42.960 --> 12:46.830
We met not long after all this,
and I was messed up about Laura...

12:46.880 --> 12:48.150
And I was missing you.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.430
God, you don't half talk bullshit.
No wonder you're such a good lawyer.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.150
No, it's true. After I got to
London, I missed you terribly.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.430
That's because I was your
housekeeper, and cook.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.630
- Come on! - When we first
met, you couldn't boil an egg.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.150
- I learned.
- Cos I taught you.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.950
Well, I'm now an extremely
fine chef, I'll have you know.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.950
I'll believe that when I see it.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.390
Well, let me prove it to
you. I'll cook you lunch.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.440
No...

13:11.240 --> 13:13.040
Liz...

13:14.040 --> 13:16.390
.. I... really would appreciate it

13:16.440 --> 13:20.270
if we could just... just talk.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.270
You know, everything between
us, it ended so abruptly.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.350
- It had to be that way...
- Well, maybe, maybe.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.590
But so much happened for both of us.

13:28.640 --> 13:32.590
You know, and for the record, I didn't
miss you because you taught me how to cook.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.960
I missed you because
you were my best friend.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.080
Look, please, ju... just lunch?

13:44.280 --> 13:46.280
After that, I'll go.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.950
Bancroft didn't know Laura, but she
did know the husband, Tim Fraser.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.830
That's why she was at the wedding.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.830
They were at uni together.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.360
Really good friends,
by the looks of things.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.870
Did you get all that from the son?

15:06.920 --> 15:08.110
He gave me the lead.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.990
Told you he'd talk to me.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.390
Look, I'm gonna be home in, like,
half an hour. Can you come over?

15:13.440 --> 15:16.000
- I'm with a friend.
I'll be over soon. - OK.

15:33.480 --> 15:34.590
Oh, I've missed you.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.390
I've missed you, too.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.080
Come in.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.870
Look, I didn't know who else to call.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.640
This copper was meant to
stay, but then he just left.

15:46.600 --> 15:50.080
- Is that...?
- Yeah, it's Rahid. He's five now.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.560
What's going on, Za? Does
Daanish know you've run?

15:57.640 --> 15:59.390
He's in on it.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.230
In on what? What you talking about?

16:01.280 --> 16:03.160
Daanish is gonna rat on Athif.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.720
That's why we're here. In protection.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.710
- Is a detective called
Bancroft running you? - Yeah.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.360
She was meant to be here
today but she didn't turn up.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.990
I don't even know what she's
like. If we can trust her.

16:18.040 --> 16:21.720
I think you can. She's a good
police officer. One of the best.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.630
She might actually do it.
Get the bastard locked up.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.390
Hey.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.360
Maybe you could come home.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.720
I have lost out on so
much because of Athif.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.880
Hiya. Listen to this.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.230
Witness statement from Tim Fraser's alibi.

17:04.280 --> 17:08.270
"Mr Fraser was seen in the law library
by at least three other people."

17:08.319 --> 17:11.630
Right? But there's no names,
there's no statements,

17:11.680 --> 17:14.990
and there was no action raised
whatsoever to trace these witnesses.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.150
Bancroft signed off on this.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.910
And it's complete crap.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.160
So? Maybe she made a mistake.

17:22.079 --> 17:25.750
I think she was covering for him.
I need to take this to Walker.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.310
If Bancroft was covering
for him, this will sink her.

17:28.359 --> 17:32.400
Makes sense, though, don't it? Why she
never told us she knew the Frasers.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.110
Maybe we shouldn't rush in. This
case has been unsolved for years.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.150
A few more weeks will make no difference.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.990
You've changed your tune.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.430
Wait until she's wound up the Kamara op.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.630
But Tim Fraser is in town now.

17:45.680 --> 17:50.280
You can go to London and question him later.
Bancroft's really close to getting Athif Kamara.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.110
What does Joe do?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.270
He is a physio.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.480
Oh.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.750
What about your daughter?

18:02.800 --> 18:04.230
- There you go.
- Cheers.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.280
Well, Amber's only 17 but...

18:06.880 --> 18:08.510
she has mentioned the police.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.710
- Oh. More fool her.
- That's what I say.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.870
Mm.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.470
Have you got a picture?

18:15.520 --> 18:17.270
Yeah.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.300
Damn sofa.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.030
Ohh, look at that.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.030
Yeah, she looks like you. Or
how you looked then, anyway.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.430
Have I changed a lot?

18:29.480 --> 18:31.520
We all have, haven't we?

18:32.280 --> 18:36.670
You don't notice most of the time
and then you catch yourself at a
certain angle and you think...

18:36.720 --> 18:38.200
Who the hell is that?

18:40.160 --> 18:41.470
Oh, my God.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.030
Gosh, you keep that?

18:44.080 --> 18:46.560
Tim, no wonder your
marriage is in trouble.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.280
Well, Laura's always
been a problem for Freya.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.990
- You have, too.
- Oh, shut up.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.520
It's true.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.600
I didn't want to leave you.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.400
And I thought about it a lot.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.440
What life would have been like with you.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.670
I think you should go.
You'll miss your train.

19:09.720 --> 19:14.150
Well, actually, I've already booked myself
into a hotel. The one down the road.

19:14.200 --> 19:19.150
Coming up here wasn't just about
Laura. I wanted to re-connect with you.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.390
What, and you just, what, presumed
that I'd just fall back in your lap?

19:22.440 --> 19:26.480
No. I didn't... I didn't presume anything.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.080
I hoped.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.990
- No. Come on, no...
- I know you want to.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.430
You've always wanted to.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.550
- God, you arrogant shit!
- It's true, though.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.830
I don't want this all
raked up again, all right?

19:42.880 --> 19:44.870
I'm happy. My life is great...

19:44.920 --> 19:47.590
Oh, what? So you're just
gonna cut off from me again?

19:47.640 --> 19:50.270
Yes, because there's nothing
between us, and never was.

19:50.320 --> 19:54.280
- That is not fucking true.
- Oh, just get out, Tim. Just get out.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.470
I'm disturbing you. Sorry.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.960
Oh, no, I... Sorry, I thought you were...

20:35.040 --> 20:36.950
It doesn't matter. Erm...

20:37.000 --> 20:40.800
Well, it must be important if you've just
turned up here. You'd better come in.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.070
It's about Zaheera Kamara.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.150
What do you know about Zaheera?

20:53.200 --> 20:55.790
We're old friends. From school.

20:55.840 --> 20:59.150
She called me and... I went to see her.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.750
She shouldn't have called
you. You shouldn't have gone.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.190
She told me everything.
That you're protecting her.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.470
She'd been left on her
own. She was freaking out.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.270
She shouldn't be contacting anyone.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.830
Zaheera's strong but she
needs support through this.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.080
I wanted you to know I can help.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.310
Er... you do realise how
confidential this is, don't you?

21:19.360 --> 21:22.880
I know what's at stake.
I come from Highwater.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.710
I grew up with the Kamara
family breathing down my neck.

21:25.760 --> 21:29.880
I knew Athif. I'm not
keen on people knowing.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.920
OK.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.030
Well, er...

21:37.080 --> 21:39.080
I'll keep it to myself.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.590
As long as you tell no-one about Zaheera.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.670
If I need another pair of
hands, I'll let you know.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.800
- My card. The number's on it.
- Thank you.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.270
Is there something else?

21:52.320 --> 21:54.120
I think you ought to know...

21:55.600 --> 21:58.080
.. the Laura Fraser
cold case is still open.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.840
Why are you telling me that?

22:03.720 --> 22:06.320
You have a real chance of getting Athif.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.560
I don't want anything getting in your way.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.950
Who is it?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.840
Elizabeth Bancroft.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.280
Erm... just a minute!

22:44.880 --> 22:46.720
Oh, what you doing here?

22:58.960 --> 23:00.720
Oh...

23:01.760 --> 23:03.160
.. you have been busy.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.630
It came to my attention that
you knew Laura and Tim Fraser,

23:07.680 --> 23:09.790
and I thought I should
find out how you met.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.910
You could have just asked
me. I'd have told you.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.510
Then why didn't you?

23:13.560 --> 23:16.710
All the time I've been on this
case, you've not said anything.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.320
You know, the irony is I
was gonna ring you today.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.070
Tim Fraser... is here. He's in town.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.030
- Why?
- Came to see you, actually.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.950
He thought the case was still
open, which it obviously is.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.960
- I'm still doing some work on it, yes.
- For Walker?

23:36.400 --> 23:39.120
And is he aware that I know Tim Fraser?

23:40.200 --> 23:42.790
I haven't told him.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.880
I haven't decided what to do.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.720
But I might have to.

23:51.400 --> 23:55.390
Did Tim Fraser really have an alibi,
guv? Because this doesn't count as one.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.910
He said he was in the library
alone and I believed him.

23:57.960 --> 24:01.750
No-one ever corroborated that but you
said they did. You covered for him.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.870
He was terrified he'd be suspected.

24:03.920 --> 24:04.600
Why?

24:10.080 --> 24:12.280
Tim and Laura had a...

24:13.280 --> 24:15.840
.. difficult relationship.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.990
He didn't want the baby.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.560
How do you know that?

24:21.480 --> 24:24.910
They had a... massive row...

24:24.960 --> 24:27.200
a few days before the murder.

24:28.040 --> 24:30.350
There's nothing mentioned
about that in the file.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.320
A neighbour heard...

24:35.560 --> 24:37.680
.. and I got rid of the statement.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.990
You concealed evidence?

24:44.040 --> 24:45.920
Yes, I know, I know. I...

24:46.360 --> 24:48.630
I can't believe I did something so stupid.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.990
But it would have looked
so bad for him, Katherine.

24:51.040 --> 24:54.070
- You could have lost your job.
- Yeah. I still could. I could do time.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.910
Why did you do that?

24:55.960 --> 24:58.200
Tim meant a great deal to me.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.840
He was my best friend.

25:05.160 --> 25:09.400
And I was... 100% convinced
that he was innocent.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.960
Laura's death devastated him.

25:17.880 --> 25:20.750
At least I thought it did.

25:27.680 --> 25:31.550
Are you saying you think...
Tim Fraser may have done this?

25:31.600 --> 25:34.880
I don't know, Katherine, I don't...
I don't know. I don't know.

25:35.520 --> 25:40.750
It's just... after Laura died, he left
for London so quickly, I did wonder...

25:40.800 --> 25:42.590
I need to ask you, though.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.230
Did you ever sleep with
him or did you like him...

25:45.280 --> 25:46.430
God, no!

25:46.480 --> 25:49.030
No. It wasn't like that. It was...

25:49.080 --> 25:52.440
We were just really close. We
went through a lot together and...

25:59.120 --> 26:01.720
What are you gonna do?

26:03.200 --> 26:05.070
Interview him under caution.

26:05.120 --> 26:09.600
You've not got enough to caution him. You'll
have to go in softly and see where that gets you.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.280
And... what about me?

26:17.720 --> 26:21.840
I have made a terrible mistake
and I ought to pay for it.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.670
I'm gonna work out a way
to present this to Walker.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.070
And I'm gonna leave you out of it.

26:34.120 --> 26:38.680
No, no, no, no, no. I will not have
you put your career on the line.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.880
I won't be the reason
that yours goes under.

28:52.320 --> 28:55.030
Tim Fraser QC. He's the
husband of the victim.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.150
I want to bring him in for questioning.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.190
New forensic evidence shows us

28:59.240 --> 29:03.070
that we have a staged burglary... by
someone who knew what they were doing.

29:03.120 --> 29:06.750
We also have new information
that... Tim didn't want his baby

29:06.800 --> 29:08.630
and that the marriage was unravelling.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.270
Who says?

29:10.320 --> 29:11.720
Len Dorman.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.710
Well, get it down in a statement.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.430
Then there's these.

29:16.480 --> 29:20.320
Neighbours report an argument
two nights before the murder.

29:21.800 --> 29:25.550
"Couldn't hear what they were saying but
they were shouting. Then she was crying."

29:25.600 --> 29:27.150
Where have these turned up from?

29:27.200 --> 29:30.510
From another file from 1990. The
paperwork is a complete mess.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.560
Guv, I really need to move
on this. Tim Fraser's in town.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.750
What about Bancroft? How
does she fit into this?

29:37.800 --> 29:41.710
Haven't really got anything on her,
other than Fraser's alibi is shaky.

29:41.760 --> 29:44.660
She didn't follow up on the
assertion he was in the library.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.590
- Why didn't she? - I've talked
to her about it. She admits it.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.280
It's always bothered her.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.670
Haverstock told her not to.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.310
He was convinced that Laura's
killer was a burglar.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.350
She was just following orders.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.480
- We've got nothing else on her?
- I can't find anything.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.920
Tim Fraser, please, guv?

30:06.040 --> 30:07.600
Thanks.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.630
Kamara, on your feet.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.680
Doctor will see you now.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.030
Look who it is. Why don't you tell
Daddy what you did today at school?

30:44.080 --> 30:46.350
We did Book Day at school.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.750
- What did you go as?
- A dragon.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.520
Put your mum on.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.870
Did they get you somewhere safe?

30:55.920 --> 31:00.270
I don't know. I suppose it is. It's
in town. And Athif's back tomorrow.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.510
Zaheera? Hi. We're gonna move you.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.630
They've found you
somewhere in the country.

31:04.680 --> 31:07.310
It's far enough away that
no-one's gonna know who you are.

31:07.360 --> 31:11.390
There's a really good local primary school
for Rahid, so you can start again, right?

31:11.440 --> 31:14.000
Are you definitely all
right with this, Za?

31:15.800 --> 31:17.920
Tell her what she wants to know.

31:32.280 --> 31:34.750
I want you...

31:34.800 --> 31:36.160
to look at these pictures.

31:37.640 --> 31:40.510
Marc Buric, Serbian mafia.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.390
Kirill Vasiliev, same business.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.280
What's Athif doing with them?

31:49.440 --> 31:51.280
Buying guns.

31:57.080 --> 32:00.080
- How many?
- Shitloads.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.070
What port are they coming through?

32:04.120 --> 32:05.920
Hull.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.790
And what's he gonna do with them?

32:12.840 --> 32:15.920
Sell them... to the highest
bidder. He doesn't care who.

32:23.360 --> 32:27.750
Mr Fraser. I'm DS Stevens.
Do you mind if I sit down?

32:27.800 --> 32:29.720
I, erm...

32:31.080 --> 32:32.670
How did you know I was here?

32:32.720 --> 32:34.760
Superintendent Bancroft told me.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.480
Right.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.830
I've been trying to catch
up with you for a while.

32:41.880 --> 32:45.270
Well, I... came up... to talk to you,

32:45.320 --> 32:48.000
but too late, obviously,
because the case is closed.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.150
- Actually, it's still open.
- Oh? How?

32:51.200 --> 32:53.910
I mean, why? Do you have new evidence?

32:53.960 --> 32:56.470
Oh, having re-examined the old evidence,

32:56.520 --> 32:59.750
we have reason to believe that
the crime scene was staged...

32:59.800 --> 33:01.800
to look like a burglary.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.630
- Staged?
- Yes.

33:04.680 --> 33:09.190
And we're confident that the new
forensic evidence would hold up in court.

33:09.240 --> 33:12.990
We now want to, erm...
explore people who knew Laura.

33:13.040 --> 33:16.150
Someone that she could have let in
or could have let themselves in.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.300
Can you think of anyone who might
have wanted to harm your wife?

33:20.040 --> 33:21.960
No. No, I mean...

33:23.360 --> 33:24.830
.. why would anyone...?

33:24.880 --> 33:26.270
No enemies at work?

33:26.320 --> 33:28.230
Laura worked behind a bar.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.880
I wanted her to stop.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.880
It wasn't a job for a pregnant woman.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.440
How did you feel about Laura's pregnancy?

33:42.000 --> 33:45.200
- I was delighted. - Even though
your marriage was in difficulties?

33:47.160 --> 33:49.070
Who told you that?

33:49.120 --> 33:51.350
A reliable source.

33:51.400 --> 33:55.680
You argued with Laura two
nights before she died.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.360
Sounds like it was quite a row.

34:01.520 --> 34:03.670
Well, that's because she'd been drinking.

34:03.720 --> 34:07.750
Look, Laura could be... she
could be wild sometimes,

34:07.800 --> 34:09.989
and she wasn't exactly making adjustments.

34:10.040 --> 34:13.340
I'm an anxious dad. You should see
what I'm like with my daughter now.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.560
Can we talk about your alibi?

34:19.719 --> 34:21.080
You were in the library.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.989
Yes.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.280
Were there many people there with you?

34:26.719 --> 34:31.270
- I don't remember. - See, cos the thing is,
this paperwork doesn't really add up to much.

34:31.320 --> 34:36.679
You do realise this conversation isn't
admissible because you haven't cautioned me.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.429
Sir...

34:40.480 --> 34:43.400
Superintendent Bancroft
has told me everything.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.639
Why did you persuade her
to falsify your alibi?

34:48.199 --> 34:51.830
- I did no such thing!
- That's not how she remembers it.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.870
Well, Superintendent Bancroft must have...
misremembered. I think we're done here.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.350
- Please, Mr Fraser.
- No, no.

34:57.400 --> 35:00.310
First time you lot get it wrong
by thinking it was a burglary,

35:00.360 --> 35:02.510
and now you're about to
just mess it all up again.

35:02.560 --> 35:06.670
I didn't kill Laura. I was in love with her,
for God's sake! We'd only just got married!

35:06.720 --> 35:09.510
- Did Laura have a lover?
- No.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.070
Did you?

35:11.120 --> 35:12.670
Of course not. No.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.720
There was nobody you were involved with?

35:19.200 --> 35:21.350
I want surveillance on Athif 24/7.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.550
Zaheera says he's coming back
through Gatwick tomorrow afternoon.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.590
- We'll pick him up there.
- Need a track on his car.

35:27.640 --> 35:32.040
Intercept on his phone. Need to
know when those guns are coming in.

35:34.880 --> 35:37.310
- Is this all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Go in.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.120
Take that, will you? Briefing in 30.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.160
- Tim, look. Listen...
- Just shut the fuck up.

35:47.040 --> 35:49.400
DS Stevens just came to see me, but...

35:50.400 --> 35:52.990
.. you already know that because
you told her where I was.

35:53.040 --> 35:57.280
- Well, she found out we knew each other.
- She had the argument witness statements.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.950
You said you got rid of them.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.830
And she knew about the faked alibi.

36:01.880 --> 36:03.950
I never should have
listened to you about that.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.030
You were shit scared. "They always think it's
the husband." That's what you kept saying.

36:08.080 --> 36:11.590
Stevens hasn't got enough on you. It's the
forensics that matter. She's got jack shit.

36:11.640 --> 36:15.640
You're wrong. They have new forensics and
they show that the burglary was staged.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.670
But they'd have got no
DNA. They've got no prints.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.070
Stevens will get them.
She's... she's determined.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.630
- Stevens is just a baby.
- She was trying to rattle me.

36:24.680 --> 36:28.200
But you're right. She doesn't have
jack shit because I didn't do it!

36:31.520 --> 36:33.990
Maybe it was somebody from
Laura's work, an old flame?

36:34.040 --> 36:36.790
I mean, I can't believe she was
celibate before she knew you.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.790
- Oh, you never really did like
her, did you? - Oh, come on.

36:39.840 --> 36:42.390
I didn't think she was good
enough for you, that's all.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.440
I was neutral. I didn't have an opinion.

36:45.280 --> 36:48.440
Then why do you still go up to her grave?

36:49.800 --> 36:51.680
Because she was my first body...

36:52.680 --> 36:55.520
.. and we never caught her
killer, so she stayed with me.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.150
All right.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.070
I think the facts are these.

37:01.120 --> 37:04.790
Laura knew the person who murdered
her because she let her killer in.

37:04.840 --> 37:09.950
She was stabbed 18 times, and she was
bitten. It was a crime of passion.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.270
I don't know why I didn't see that before.

37:12.320 --> 37:15.870
And then the killer set up the
scene to look like a burglary,

37:15.920 --> 37:19.270
and did it well enough to convince a
seasoned copper like Haverstock...

37:19.320 --> 37:21.870
Is this a confession? Cos
you've just described yourself.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.920
Well, I'm describing you, too.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.750
Was it because of me?

37:30.800 --> 37:34.080
Did you... did you kill her because of me?

37:45.200 --> 37:47.280
God, you're pathetic.

37:52.760 --> 37:55.000
Laura was worth ten of you.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.520
She was strong but you... you...

37:59.280 --> 38:01.590
blame everybody else
for your own weaknesses.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.390
You use other people to prop you up.

38:03.440 --> 38:04.990
Why would I kill anyone for you?

38:05.040 --> 38:06.830
I will go over every inch of evidence...

38:06.880 --> 38:09.750
You point the police at
me and I will destroy you!

38:09.800 --> 38:13.390
- I've got the witness statements, the alibis...
- You set all of that up!

38:13.440 --> 38:15.070
You wanted to leave Laura for me.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.830
You slept with me as soon as she died and
then you turn up back here 27 years later.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.470
You force yourself on me.

38:20.520 --> 38:23.350
You came to my hotel. You
wanted to have sex with me.

38:23.400 --> 38:27.200
No-one... is ever going to believe you.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.080
You fucking bitch.

38:38.800 --> 38:43.760
You've got a wife. You've got a...
daughter you adore, an impressive career.

38:45.760 --> 38:47.660
You talk, you're gonna lose all of that.

38:51.520 --> 38:55.160
No, you go back to London. I'll sort
this out, just like I did before.

39:19.380 --> 39:20.960
Elizabeth, a word, please?

39:26.800 --> 39:29.150
I don't think Tim Fraser
killed his wife, guv.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.560
Why not?

39:31.600 --> 39:33.790
Because he told me he
didn't and I believed him.

39:33.840 --> 39:36.590
And if you were there, guv, you
would have believed him, too.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.990
Well, if he didn't, who did?

39:38.040 --> 39:41.070
When I asked him if he was
having an affair, he clammed up.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.080
Couldn't get away from me fast enough.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.080
Maybe he had a lover.

39:48.080 --> 39:51.000
How are you gonna find out who
he was shafting 27 years ago?

39:52.440 --> 39:56.470
It's a haul of weapons, including assault
rifles and Skorpion machine pistols.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.670
- How many?
- Three dozen.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.670
I wanna seize the firearms and
apprehend Athif simultaneously.

40:01.720 --> 40:04.430
- Your retirement present.
- Ah. Well, don't screw it up.

40:04.480 --> 40:07.360
- I won't. Trust me.
- Good.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.200
Anything else?

40:11.280 --> 40:12.440
I, er...

40:14.240 --> 40:18.030
.. don't normally say anything
but... I get the feeling

40:18.080 --> 40:22.110
- that there are certain individuals
working against me. - How do you mean?

40:22.160 --> 40:25.800
Well, I'm a woman. I'm going
for the big job and, er...

40:26.280 --> 40:28.200
I'm not the only person going for it.

40:29.080 --> 40:33.270
- You mean Walker?
- Yeah. I think he sees me as competition.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.790
What's he doing?

40:34.840 --> 40:38.080
Well, he's... going through
all my old cases...

40:38.760 --> 40:40.510
trying to find shit on me.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.990
I'm afraid if he doesn't find
it, he'll just make it up.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.790
I just want to do my
job. End of. No games.

40:45.840 --> 40:49.080
- Thanks for letting me know.
- Thank you, sir.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.640
I won't be a sec. Let
me just finish these.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.150
I was actually... hoping
to talk to your mum.

41:41.200 --> 41:44.590
Well, she's still at work.
What do you want her for?

41:44.640 --> 41:48.230
Oh, it was just, erm... that...
work thing I mentioned.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.070
Oh, the guy who was here at the weekend.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.560
Erm... Tim? Is that who
you were looking for?

41:54.440 --> 41:56.750
I don't know. I haven't checked up on him.

41:56.800 --> 41:59.790
I wouldn't mind knowing who he
was myself, actually, because...

41:59.840 --> 42:02.160
she was gone all that
night, with him, I reckon.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.640
Your mum was sleeping with him?

42:09.360 --> 42:11.230
Oh, can you...

42:11.280 --> 42:14.310
erm... don't tell anyone
at work about that.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.080
Of course I won't.

42:17.640 --> 42:20.750
You know, maybe we should...
follow their example.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.270
No, I can't, sorry.

42:22.320 --> 42:25.950
Jesus Christ, Katherine, can you...
.. can you please make your mind up

42:26.000 --> 42:28.750
because one minute you're all
over me, then the next it's...

42:28.800 --> 42:30.870
Look, it's that Andy guy again, isn't it?

42:30.920 --> 42:32.670
It's got nothing to do with Andy.

42:34.840 --> 42:37.320
- Your mum...
- What about my mum, Katherine?

42:39.800 --> 42:42.720
I can't talk about this
right now. Sorry...

42:44.280 --> 42:45.590
We'll talk tomorrow, OK?

42:52.080 --> 42:54.910
- Am I interrupting?
- No, it was you she wanted to talk to anyway.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.790
- Joe... Joe!
- I'm done.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.940
Didn't realise you were still an item.

43:04.280 --> 43:07.590
I'm glad I caught you. I wanted
to have a chat with you, actually.

43:07.640 --> 43:10.400
Is Walker building a case against me?

43:11.560 --> 43:14.830
Well, he wants to but, erm...
I haven't given him anything.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.760
- I kept your name out of it.
- Good.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.480
So, how did it go with Tim?

43:21.800 --> 43:23.700
I didn't really get anything out of him.

43:24.960 --> 43:28.400
- You still think he could have done it?
- I don't know.

43:31.040 --> 43:34.040
What's the matter? Why
are you so frightened?

43:34.840 --> 43:37.280
I'm just tired. Been a long day.

43:37.960 --> 43:39.790
So tell me what Tim said.

43:39.840 --> 43:41.640
Nothing new.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.280
I need to go, OK?

43:45.680 --> 43:46.750
Aargh!

43:46.800 --> 43:49.270
- You're lying. Why are you
lying to me? - I'm not.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.550
You and Walker are coming
after me, aren't you?

43:51.600 --> 43:53.070
Please, Elizabeth.

43:53.120 --> 43:56.870
You didn't tell me you had new evidence to
prove there wasn't a burglary. Why didn't you?

43:56.920 --> 43:59.720
Well, you didn't tell me you
were sleeping with Tim Fraser.

44:10.200 --> 44:13.430
You take me on and I will finish
you, do you understand me?

44:13.480 --> 44:15.080
Laura took you on, didn't she?

44:21.200 --> 44:22.600
Aargh!

44:25.320 --> 44:28.950
After everything I've done for
you. You've let me down, Katherine.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.400
You are not worthy of my support.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.550
Now get out of my house!

44:34.600 --> 44:36.200
Get out!

45:53.280 --> 45:55.160
No!
