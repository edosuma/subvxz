WEBVTT

00:01.112 --> 00:04.112
<b>1x20 - Partners</b>

00:06.113 --> 00:09.015
I have been a fool,

00:09.017 --> 00:13.219
made mistakes --
monumental ones.

00:13.221 --> 00:18.124
I now realize that I was never
destined to be a leader

00:18.126 --> 00:21.160
or even an equal partner,

00:21.162 --> 00:24.330
And I'm at peace with that.

00:24.332 --> 00:26.799
I have gained
a clear understanding

00:26.801 --> 00:29.135
of my place in this universe,

00:29.137 --> 00:31.871
of who I am,

00:31.873 --> 00:35.441
of who I was always
meant to be --

00:35.443 --> 00:39.478
Starscream, second in command,

00:39.480 --> 00:43.449
humble servant to lord Megatron.

00:43.451 --> 00:47.720
Thank you for listening,
Soundwave.

00:51.458 --> 00:53.426
Is this true?

00:53.428 --> 00:55.361
Starscream never mentioned it?

00:55.363 --> 01:00.299
If he's up to his old tricks,
I shall grind him into powder.

01:01.769 --> 01:04.337
Starscream.

01:04.339 --> 01:05.538
Lord Megatron,

01:05.540 --> 01:08.207
please excuse
Airachnid's impertinence.

01:08.209 --> 01:12.745
Now, what was it that I
allegedly failed to mention?

01:12.747 --> 01:14.313
The Harbinger.

01:14.315 --> 01:17.817
What about it?

01:17.819 --> 01:20.586
Eons ago,
a decepticon transport

01:20.588 --> 01:22.989
Crash landed
on this planet.

01:22.991 --> 01:25.124
Oh, please.
Common knowledge.

01:25.126 --> 01:28.427
I scouted the crash site
when we first arrived on earth.

01:28.429 --> 01:29.829
Then I presume
you recovered

01:29.831 --> 01:31.664
The experimental weapon
prototype

01:31.666 --> 01:33.833
The Harbinger
had been transporting.

01:35.269 --> 01:37.036
Where is
the crash site?

01:37.038 --> 01:40.139
It was never logged
into your ship's database.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.607
You failed to record

01:41.609 --> 01:44.543
the coordinates
of a decepticon transport?!

01:44.545 --> 01:47.380
An oversight, master.

01:47.382 --> 01:50.516
But I noted
its exact location.

01:50.518 --> 01:52.785
Then you can lead
airachnid there

01:52.787 --> 01:55.888
So that she may retrieve
the prototype for me.

01:55.890 --> 02:00.493
My personal native guide --
how delightful.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.472 --> 03:02.875
Hey, partner.
Heck of a view you got up here.

03:02.877 --> 03:04.277
If there's even a small chance

03:04.279 --> 03:05.912
Your spark
is out there listening,

03:05.914 --> 03:09.549
Well, we could really
use you, Cliff.

03:09.551 --> 03:12.752
Seems like every day another
decepticon arrives on the scene.

03:12.754 --> 03:15.922
We're outnumbered and outgunned.

03:15.924 --> 03:19.592
Yeah, I know what you'd say --
"sounds like a fair fight."

03:21.596 --> 03:25.631
If that's the world
we live in, so be it.

03:25.633 --> 03:28.601
I just want you to know...

03:28.603 --> 03:29.936
I haven't given up.

03:29.938 --> 03:33.039
I'm gonna find the 'con
who took you from us.

03:46.988 --> 03:50.756
Your chosen vehicle mode
lacks thrust.

03:50.758 --> 03:53.125
Are you going to preen,
or are you going to guide?

03:53.127 --> 03:56.495
I will reveal the exact location
of the Harbinger

03:56.497 --> 03:59.865
when you tell me exactly
what we're looking for.

03:59.867 --> 04:01.901
That information
is need-to-know,

04:01.903 --> 04:03.769
And right no
you don't.

04:03.771 --> 04:07.006
Oh, you would do well
to respect me, airachnid.

04:07.008 --> 04:09.041
Before I joined Megatron,

04:09.043 --> 04:13.279
I was air commander of
a squadron of energon seekers.

04:13.281 --> 04:14.981
On Cybertron.

04:14.983 --> 04:17.683
And how many eons ago
was that?

04:17.685 --> 04:21.420
Just recently,
I personally vanquished

04:21.422 --> 04:24.357
one of Optimus Prime's
fiercest warriors --

04:24.359 --> 04:26.292
Cliffjumper.

04:26.294 --> 04:28.694
You snuffed an autobot?

04:28.696 --> 04:32.398
Yes, I did --
without mercy.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.699
Oh.

04:33.701 --> 04:35.735
Even Megatron
showed you mercy

04:35.737 --> 04:38.104
when he planned
to terminate you at the mine.

04:38.106 --> 04:40.339
What?!
He told you about that?!

04:40.341 --> 04:41.841
We talk.

04:43.011 --> 04:45.645
The wreckage lies
just beneath where we stand.

04:45.647 --> 04:48.714
I will need to find
a point of entry.

04:52.619 --> 04:54.086
Show off.

04:58.859 --> 05:00.192
Suit yourself.

05:00.194 --> 05:04.296
I conducted a thorough search
of this husk years ago.

05:05.499 --> 05:07.199
What are you doing?

05:07.201 --> 05:09.201
Accessing the cargo manifest --

05:09.203 --> 05:12.638
or didn't you think to do that
during your thorough search?

05:12.640 --> 05:16.642
Idiot. The ship's systems
haven't been activated for eons.

05:16.644 --> 05:19.845
The autobots could detect
its energy signature.

05:19.847 --> 05:24.150
Ah, here it is.
Section 23.

05:25.687 --> 05:28.354
Optimus, our scanners
have detected

05:28.356 --> 05:32.758
A decepticon energy profile,
but it's ancient.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.193
The past has a way

05:34.195 --> 05:37.363
Of catching up
with the present, ratchet.

05:41.968 --> 05:45.404
Section 23 should be
right about...

05:45.406 --> 05:48.407
Here?

05:48.409 --> 05:50.476
The ship just ends.

05:50.478 --> 05:52.845
It must have broken in half
during the crash.

05:52.847 --> 05:55.081
Or in the air.

05:55.083 --> 05:57.416
If you performed
actual research,

05:57.418 --> 05:59.719
You would have learned
that an autobot battalion

05:59.721 --> 06:02.555
Shot the Harbinger
out of the sky.

06:02.557 --> 06:04.557
How far away
is the other half?

06:04.559 --> 06:08.661
I'm afraid that information
is need-to-know.

06:10.698 --> 06:12.098
What are you --

06:12.100 --> 06:15.267
You're trying to make me look
like a fool before Megatron,

06:15.269 --> 06:16.836
Have me return
empty-handed

06:16.838 --> 06:18.704
While you locate
that weapon yourself.

06:18.706 --> 06:21.140
How dare you accuse me?!

06:21.142 --> 06:24.143
You are nothing but a scavenger,
an opportunist!

06:24.145 --> 06:26.645
Aren't you one to talk?

06:26.647 --> 06:32.017
Perhaps, but I've changed,
seen the error of my ways.

06:32.019 --> 06:35.921
I live
to serve Megatron now.

06:35.923 --> 06:37.590
You won't live
to serve anyone

06:37.592 --> 06:40.092
If you don't tell me where
to find the rest of this ship --

06:40.094 --> 06:41.761
Now.

06:41.763 --> 06:44.330
A few clicks
north of here,

06:44.332 --> 06:45.731
through a stone arch.

06:45.733 --> 06:47.032
Now release me.

06:47.034 --> 06:50.870
When I have the weapon
in hand --

06:50.872 --> 06:55.808
That is, if I can find my way
back without my guide.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.144
This is not funny,
Airachnid.

06:58.146 --> 07:00.579
Come back here right now
and cut me loose!

07:00.581 --> 07:03.149
Airachnid,
that is an order!

07:03.151 --> 07:05.918
I am your
commanding officer!

07:08.622 --> 07:10.990
- Airachnid!
- Surrender.

07:13.994 --> 07:16.996
Airachnid, you traitor!

07:25.238 --> 07:27.840
Arcee!
Wait!

07:37.083 --> 07:40.252
Arcee.

07:40.254 --> 07:44.623
I didn't peg you for re-signing
with the decepticons.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.759
A temporary arrangement,
Arcee.

07:46.761 --> 07:48.828
You know I prefer
working alone.

07:59.239 --> 08:02.474
Speaking of, add any more
deceased partners

08:02.476 --> 08:04.343
To your growing list?

08:04.345 --> 08:08.447
Airachnid, release her.

08:15.822 --> 08:20.593
Arcee, you know better
than to engage the enemy alone.

08:20.595 --> 08:21.961
Not her.

08:21.963 --> 08:25.931
Not after what she did
to tailgate.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.902
No. Please.

08:30.971 --> 08:33.005
Tailgate!

08:33.006 --> 08:35.808
She will pay.

08:35.809 --> 08:39.445
Revenge will not bring back
those we have lost.

08:39.447 --> 08:41.280
Is that understood?

08:41.282 --> 08:43.948
Move it!

08:43.951 --> 08:45.985
No need to use force.

08:47.722 --> 08:50.022
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

08:50.024 --> 08:53.158
 Is that right?
And what do you want in return?

08:54.861 --> 08:58.464
I want to be...
on your side.

09:13.944 --> 09:17.180
On our side?
Yeah, right.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.716
And I've been lobbing
with the fallen.

09:19.718 --> 09:21.951
You wouldn't betray
the decepticons.

09:21.953 --> 09:23.219
Wouldn't I?

09:23.221 --> 09:24.988
What have they done
for me lately

09:24.990 --> 09:27.991
Besides humiliate me,
spy on me, demote me?

09:27.993 --> 09:31.895
Megatron tried to extinguish
my spark in cold blood

09:31.897 --> 09:33.263
Then all
but replaced me

09:33.265 --> 09:35.532
With that traitorous wretch
airachnid.

09:35.534 --> 09:39.369
She abandoned me,
left me for scrap.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.971
So, why not
rat them out?

09:48.346 --> 09:51.514
He's telling the truth about Megatron
trying to scrap him.

09:51.516 --> 09:53.716
I saw with my own eyes.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.920
You're not saying you
actually trust Starscream?

09:56.922 --> 09:59.055
Trust him? Never.

09:59.057 --> 10:03.927
But this may be the one time
our objectives align.

10:03.929 --> 10:05.929
You're right to be wary,
Bulkhead,

10:05.931 --> 10:09.199
But I agree with Arcee.

10:24.982 --> 10:27.083
Be still, my beating spark.

10:45.569 --> 10:46.870
What do you know?

10:49.106 --> 10:51.107
Could still be a trap.

10:51.109 --> 10:54.144
Starscream's loyalty
to Megatron

10:54.146 --> 10:56.279
Has always
been questionable.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.582
If he has truly split
from the decepticons,

10:59.584 --> 11:02.152
Our prisoner's knowledge
of their agendas

11:02.154 --> 11:04.254
Could make him
a valuable ally.

11:04.256 --> 11:06.055
You don't mean
permanently,

11:06.057 --> 11:08.191
As in keys to the base
and everything?

11:08.193 --> 11:10.527
However unlikely
that scenario,

11:10.529 --> 11:12.295
Every sentient being

11:12.297 --> 11:14.998
Deserves an opportunity
for redemption.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.034
Even bot killers?
Even airachnid?

11:18.036 --> 11:22.972
Without that hope, we may never
achieve lasting peace.

11:24.575 --> 11:26.476
Rise and shine,
screamy.

11:28.212 --> 11:30.380
We're here.

11:30.382 --> 11:31.648
Where's the ship?

11:34.018 --> 11:37.554
It's through the arch,
among the stones.

11:37.556 --> 11:41.157
Bulkhead, Bumblebee,
you're with me.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.927
Arcee,
remain with our prisoner.

11:46.197 --> 11:47.830
Optimus, please.

11:50.067 --> 11:51.868
For Tailgate.

11:51.870 --> 11:54.370
Your desire
to avenge tailgate

11:54.372 --> 11:57.874
Will only continue
to cloud your judgment.

12:00.145 --> 12:02.979
Is the clamp
really necessary?

12:02.981 --> 12:05.048
I promise
not to fly away.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.150
It's really
giving me a crick.

12:07.152 --> 12:09.686
I can shove you
back in the trailer.

12:14.558 --> 12:15.992
Be alert.

12:15.994 --> 12:19.529
Airachnid is known to attack
from below ground.

12:19.531 --> 12:20.964
Right.

12:46.357 --> 12:47.957
I got her.

12:54.999 --> 12:58.868
The immobilizer,
true to its name.

13:02.773 --> 13:05.041
I'm not really so bad,
you know.

13:05.043 --> 13:08.544
Megatron --
he's the evil one.

13:08.546 --> 13:10.146
Tell it to someone
who cares.

13:10.148 --> 13:12.115
Like whom, airachnid?

13:12.117 --> 13:13.483
What I wouldn't do

13:13.485 --> 13:15.818
To get my hands
around her wretched throat.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.754
So, we can agree
on one thing.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.189
Oh, you have no idea.

13:20.191 --> 13:22.759
She showed up one day,
and the next thing you know,

13:22.761 --> 13:25.928
She's acting like
she runs the place.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.564
She whispered lies
into Megatron's ear,

13:28.566 --> 13:31.334
Maneuvered to rob me
of my rightful place.

13:31.336 --> 13:34.771
Well, she terminated
my partner.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.005
What?!

13:36.007 --> 13:38.474
She's taking credit
for scrapping him now, too?

13:38.476 --> 13:40.009
That was my doing!

13:40.011 --> 13:41.010
What?

13:42.113 --> 13:43.246
You weren't there.

13:43.248 --> 13:44.981
Of course I wasn't.

13:44.983 --> 13:47.016
I don't know
what I was thinking.

13:47.018 --> 13:48.518
Who are you
talking about?

13:48.520 --> 13:50.687
No one.
Who are you talking about?

13:50.689 --> 13:51.854
Tailgate.

13:51.856 --> 13:53.956
Uh, who's Tailgate?

13:53.958 --> 13:56.926
You were the one.

13:56.928 --> 13:59.595
You extinguished Cliffjumper.

14:04.171 --> 14:05.505
Cliffjumper?!

14:08.076 --> 14:11.077
No! No, no, no.
You misunderstand.

14:20.721 --> 14:23.055
It wasn't
like you think.

14:23.057 --> 14:25.291
The troopers
mortally wounded him.

14:25.293 --> 14:27.793
I was trying
to help Cliffjumper --

14:27.795 --> 14:29.161
Put him out
of his misery.

14:29.163 --> 14:30.630
He begged me to.

14:35.235 --> 14:37.870
Okay, okay,
it was a mistake!

14:37.872 --> 14:40.606
I've made many,
but I've changed!

14:40.608 --> 14:44.477
You wouldn't terminate a
defenseless prisoner, would you?

14:50.150 --> 14:53.419
What -- what is that?

14:53.421 --> 14:55.087
The key to your cuffs.

14:55.089 --> 14:56.255
What for?

14:56.257 --> 14:58.791
Cliff would have given you
a fighting chance.

14:58.793 --> 15:01.894
No, please!
I-I don't want to!

15:01.896 --> 15:05.231
What's past is past.
I'm one of you now.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.201
No!
No! Please! No!

15:09.203 --> 15:10.336
Take it!

15:17.412 --> 15:20.379
You're pathetic.

15:35.095 --> 15:38.097
Something wrong,
Arcee?

15:38.099 --> 15:42.268
I thought
you wanted a fight.

16:03.958 --> 16:06.058
Freeze.

16:28.348 --> 16:31.784
You're tougher to scrap
than your former partner --

16:31.786 --> 16:34.487
At least,
the one I scrapped.

16:34.489 --> 16:37.757
Was Tailgate weak
like Cliffjumper?

16:39.192 --> 16:42.895
Just keep talking,
Starscream.

16:44.448 --> 16:47.283
Tell me, bug.

16:47.285 --> 16:50.753
Do you think Megatron
will enjoy his new trophies?

16:50.755 --> 16:54.423
He'll probably use the Bulky one
here for target practice.

16:57.093 --> 17:01.297
Prime is the true prize.

17:01.299 --> 17:05.434
Perhaps he'll adorn the prow
of Megatron's warship.

17:25.289 --> 17:27.556
But you, bug --

17:27.558 --> 17:32.661
I suspect Megatron will simply
dismantle you for spare parts.

17:32.663 --> 17:35.998
As a rogue, a scavenger,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.767
I should disappear into
the night with this treasure,

17:38.769 --> 17:41.971
But using it to worm my
way into Megatron's favor

17:41.973 --> 17:44.974
Is too good an opportunity
to pass up.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.343
Wouldn't you say, Prime?

17:48.912 --> 17:50.546
I mean,
with results like this,

17:50.548 --> 17:54.083
I could end Megatron's
eternal trust.

18:02.192 --> 18:05.060
You fool!

18:25.383 --> 18:28.651
You should have finished me
when I was helpless to fight,

18:28.653 --> 18:31.487
just like I finished
Cliffjumper.

18:33.157 --> 18:38.761
Now, prepare to reunite
with your partners.

18:42.767 --> 18:46.936
What's that?
I can't hear your last words.

18:46.938 --> 18:48.804
This...

18:48.806 --> 18:52.274
is for Cliffjumper!

19:01.918 --> 19:03.585
Go on, do it.

19:03.587 --> 19:06.889
Megatron will only
terminate me for treason

19:06.891 --> 19:09.291
If I dare return
to the decepticons.

19:09.293 --> 19:13.629
You may as well be the one
to put me out of my misery.

19:13.631 --> 19:16.398
As if I needed
convincing.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.101
What?! Wait! No!

19:42.592 --> 19:46.895
<i>You left Starscream with the autobots?</i>

19:46.897 --> 19:48.731
Do you have any notion

19:48.733 --> 19:51.834
of the consequences
of your blunder?!

19:51.836 --> 19:54.636
But, my lordship,
it was Starscream's incompetence

19:54.638 --> 19:56.338
that cost us
the immobilizer.

19:56.340 --> 19:58.841
I don't care
about some trinket.

19:58.843 --> 20:02.911
My second in command
is a prisoner of the enemy...

20:02.913 --> 20:05.948
which means all
decepticon intelligence

20:05.950 --> 20:10.152
Could be at the fingertips
of the autobots!

20:10.154 --> 20:15.190
The damage looked bad,
but it was a snap to repair,

20:15.192 --> 20:17.326
Allowing us to reverse
its effect on you.

20:17.328 --> 20:20.996
You should regain your full
range of motion before long.

20:20.998 --> 20:22.998
And Arcee?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.168
She's rather resilient
for a two-wheeler.

20:31.975 --> 20:36.111
It is the external wounds
which heal the quickest.

20:36.113 --> 20:40.349
I thought settling scores
would allow me to move on.

20:40.351 --> 20:41.950
Instead,
I chased away our hope

20:41.952 --> 20:44.319
Of winning this war
any time soon.

20:44.321 --> 20:46.822
Wisdom cannot be granted,
Arcee.

20:46.824 --> 20:49.058
It must be earned...

20:49.060 --> 20:52.361
Sometimes at a cost.

21:06.709 --> 21:08.844
<i>I have been a fool,</i>

21:08.846 --> 21:12.948
<i>made mistakes --
monumental ones.</i>

21:12.950 --> 21:16.318
<i>But I have gained
a clear understanding</i>

21:16.320 --> 21:18.687
<i>of my place in this universe,</i>

21:18.689 --> 21:20.622
<i>of who I am --</i>

21:20.624 --> 21:24.460
<i>Starscream...</i>

21:24.462 --> 21:27.329
<i>Aligned with no side,</i>

21:27.331 --> 21:30.532
<i>servant to no one.</i>
