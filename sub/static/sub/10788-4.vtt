LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.

16:06.083 --> 16:10.792
LIKE YOU WERE IN
ON THIS GREAT LITTLE SECRET

16:10.792 --> 16:12.458
THAT THE REST OF US
WEREN'T PRIVY TO,

16:12.458 --> 16:16.000
AND MY PARENTS
NEVER HAD THAT...

16:16.000 --> 16:19.792
NOT EVEN
IN THE BEST OF TIMES.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.083
I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE
AND--AND TRY TO PRETEND

16:22.083 --> 16:26.000
TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH HIS MIND
BEFORE HE DIED, BUT...

16:26.000 --> 16:28.291
I KNOW YOUR HUSBAND
LOVED YOU VERY MUCH.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.125
HEY.

16:45.083 --> 16:47.959
DAWSON.

16:47.959 --> 16:49.500
HEY, MAN.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.291
THANKS FOR COMIN'.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.875
OF COURSE...

16:54.875 --> 16:56.166
BUT I CAN'T SAY
THAT THIS IS EXACTLY

16:56.166 --> 16:58.291
THE WAY I WANTED
TO SEE YOU AGAIN
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

16:58.291 --> 17:00.750
YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.667
HOW WAS YOUR SUMMER?

17:02.667 --> 17:06.000
MY SUMMER
WAS REALLY GOOD.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.583
IT WAS REALLY,
REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.125
IT TOTALLY
CLEARED MY HEAD.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.333
GOOD.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.416
HOW'S FILM SCHOOL
TREATIN' YA?

17:12.416 --> 17:15.000
UH...

17:15.000 --> 17:15.541
I'M GONNA BE DROPPIN'
OUT, ACTUALLY.

17:15.541 --> 17:18.791
WHY?

17:18.791 --> 17:22.040
[SIGHS]
IT'S A LONG STORY.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.333
GOTCHA.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.708
I'M SORRY, DAWSON.

17:33.959 --> 17:36.375
I WISH I HAD SOMETHIN' BETTER
TO SAY TO YOU THAN THAT,

17:36.375 --> 17:37.041
BUT THAT'S REALLY
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.583
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.500
REMEMBER THE TIME
HE CAUGHT US
SMOKING DOWN HERE?

17:49.750 --> 17:52.291
YEAH. I, UH...
OF COURSE I REMEMBER.

17:52.291 --> 17:55.083
SIXTH GRADE, RIGHT?
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
SEEN YOUR FATHER SO MAD.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.417
BEING MITCH,
HE HAD TO TELL US

17:56.417 --> 17:57.542
THAT HE WAS JUST
CONCERNED FOR US,

17:57.542 --> 17:58.333
WHICH WAS A BIT
OF A SURPRISE TO ME

17:58.333 --> 17:59.875
BECAUSE IF IT WAS
MY FATHER,

17:59.875 --> 18:01.166
IT WOULD BE KIND
OF A DIFFERENT STORY.

18:01.166 --> 18:02.708
IN FACT, I GUARANTEE
I'D STILL BE SMOKING
TO THIS DAY

18:02.708 --> 18:03.542
JUST TO PISS HIM OFF.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.208
AHH...

18:11.041 --> 18:12.208
WELL...

18:14.125 --> 18:15.417
I SHOULD PROBABLY
HEAD INSIDE

18:15.417 --> 18:16.750
AND MAKE MYSELF USEFUL
OR SOMETHING.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.250
ALL RIGHT?
OF COURSE.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.125
[SIGHS] IT WAS GOOD
TO SEE YOU, PACE.

18:20.959 --> 18:23.083
YEAH.

18:23.083 --> 18:23.333
COME HERE.

[SIGHS]

18:47.125 --> 18:47.417

18:49.792 --> 18:51.375
YOU PROBABLY DON'T
REMEMBER ME, DAWSON,

18:51.375 --> 18:52.959
BUT I'M SUSAN.
I'M AN OLD FRIEND

18:52.959 --> 18:54.667
OF YOUR MOTHER'S
FROM COLLEGE.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.792
RIGHT. YOU'RE MY MOM'S
DEADHEAD FRIEND.

18:56.792 --> 18:58.458
[LAUGHS]
THAT'S RIGHT.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.166
UH, TELL ME,
ARE YOU DEALING
WITH YOUR GRIEF?

19:01.166 --> 19:04.291
UH...
I'M DEALING.

19:04.291 --> 19:04.917
HOW ARE YOU
DEALING WITH IT?

19:04.917 --> 19:09.083
UM, NOT TO BE RUDE,

19:09.083 --> 19:10.625
BUT I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

19:10.625 --> 19:13.208
WHERE ARE YOU CHANNELING
ALL THE FEELINGS
YOU'RE HAVING

19:13.208 --> 19:16.458
ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S
PASSING?

19:16.458 --> 19:18.250
UM...

19:18.250 --> 19:19.792
YOU KNOW,
NOT TO BE RUDE AGAIN,

19:19.792 --> 19:21.792
BUT I REALLY DON'T HAVE
THE TIME OR THE LUXURY.

19:21.792 --> 19:22.750
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
OH, YOU MUST TAKE
THE TIME, DAWSON.

19:22.750 --> 19:23.917
Mitch: HI.

19:23.917 --> 19:25.291
YOU'VE REACHED
THE LEERYS...

MINUS DAWSON, THAT IS,

19:26.834 --> 19:30.250
WHO CAN BE REACHED
IN SUNNY CALIFORNIA
THESE DAYS.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.000
IF YOU HAVE A MESSAGE
FOR GALE, LILY,
OR MYSELF, HOWEVER,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.375
YOU CAN LEAVE IT AT--

19:38.458 --> 19:39.834
HEY.
I'M FINE.

19:39.834 --> 19:42.417
I'M...

19:43.834 --> 19:45.083
I'M FINE.

20:03.542 --> 20:04.542
[CLEARS THROAT]

20:10.333 --> 20:12.375
NOT ONE OF MY FINER
MOMENTS, HUH?

20:16.250 --> 20:18.792
YOU KNOW,
A LONG TIME AGO--

20:18.792 --> 20:20.583
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AFTER MY MOM PASSED AWAY--

20:20.583 --> 20:24.583
I WAS DIGGING THROUGH
THIS DRAWER IN THE KITCHEN

20:24.583 --> 20:26.625
LOOKING FOR A PEN
OR SOMETHING,

20:26.625 --> 20:31.375
AND I CAME ACROSS
THIS GROCERY LIST
SHE HAD MADE,

20:31.375 --> 20:35.417
AND IT WAS FILLED
WITH ALL THESE LITTLE
HEART-SHAPED DOODLES,

20:35.417 --> 20:37.291
AND I JUST...LOST IT.

20:37.291 --> 20:40.625
I CRIED LIKE A BABY
FOR HOURS.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.708
IF WHAT JUST HAPPENED
TO YOU IN THERE

20:45.708 --> 20:47.125
HAD HAPPENED TO ME
BACK THEN,

20:47.125 --> 20:48.834
I WOULD HAVE
RUN AWAY SCREAMING.

20:48.834 --> 20:51.375
I CAN'T DO THAT.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.500
WHO SAYS?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.792
I DO. I CAN'T.

20:54.792 --> 20:57.083
MY MOM'S A WRECK.
I GOTTA KEEP IT
TOGETHER.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.542
SHE'S ALLOWED
TO BE A WRECK,
AND SO ARE YOU.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.959
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

21:05.959 --> 21:07.291
YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOM,

21:07.291 --> 21:09.125
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

21:14.375 --> 21:17.625
I GOTTA SAY, JO, I--

21:17.625 --> 21:19.375
WHEN YOUR MOM DIED,
I SYMPATHIZED WITH YOU,
AND I REALLY FELT BAD,

21:19.375 --> 21:21.834
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
IT FELT LIKE THIS.

21:21.834 --> 21:23.750
NOTHING FEELS REAL.
IT'S LIKE I'VE BEEN

21:23.750 --> 21:25.333
TRANSPORTED TO SOME
ALTERNATE UNIVERSE

WHERE I'M JUST
WALKING AROUND

21:32.250 --> 21:34.792
IT'LL GET BETTER.
I PROMISE.

21:34.792 --> 21:37.500
THAT'S GOOD.
ANY, UH, ADVICE

21:37.500 --> 21:38.750
ON HOW I SHOULD
DEAL WITH THE FACT

21:38.750 --> 21:40.291
THAT MY FATHER'S
DEATH WAS ALMOST
ENTIRELY MY FAULT?

21:40.291 --> 21:44.625
WHAT? HOW DO YOU
FIGURE THAT?

21:44.625 --> 21:46.291
COME ON, JO.
THINK ABOUT IT.

21:46.291 --> 21:47.708
IF I HADN'T COME BACK
AND LAID ALL THIS
ON HIM,

21:47.708 --> 21:48.959
NONE OF THIS
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.500

21:50.500 --> 21:54.000
YOU FATHER DIED
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.291
THERE WAS NOTHING
YOU COULD DO TO STOP THAT.

21:55.291 --> 21:57.583
THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY
TRUE, JO.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.917
THAT'S, I MEAN...

21:59.917 --> 22:02.458
FIRST OFF, IF I HADN'T
SHOWED UP THAT MORNING,

22:02.458 --> 22:03.834
MY MOM WOULDN'T HAVE
MADE ME BREAKFAST,

22:03.834 --> 22:05.792
WHICH MEANS THEY WOULDN'T
HAVE RUN OUT OF MILK,

22:05.792 --> 22:08.166
WHICH MEANS MY DAD
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO DRIVE
TO THE STORE THAT NIGHT

22:08.166 --> 22:09.375
SO LILY WOULD HAVE
SOME IN THE MORNING.

22:09.375 --> 22:10.333

DON'T TELL ME
WHAT'S CRAZY, JO.

22:12.458 --> 22:14.834
FOR ALL I KNOW,
MY DAD WAS DRIVING
ALONG THAT NIGHT,

22:14.834 --> 22:17.834
PISSED, HAVING
SOME ARGUMENT
WITH ME IN HIS HEAD

22:17.834 --> 22:18.500
WHICH CAUSED HIM
TO TAKE HIS EYES
OFF THE ROAD

22:18.500 --> 22:20.125
JUST LONG ENOUGH
TO--

22:20.125 --> 22:21.583
LOOK, YOU CAN'T
DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

22:21.583 --> 22:22.959

I SAW HIM?

22:25.458 --> 22:28.000
Joey: HMM?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.083
HE SAID THAT I WAS
MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE

22:30.083 --> 22:31.458
AND THAT HE WAS
DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.208
I KNOW. YOU TOLD ME THAT.

22:39.208 --> 22:43.667
YOU REMEMBER WHAT ELSE
YOU TOLD ME?

22:43.667 --> 22:46.625
HE SAID HE LOVED YOU
VERY MUCH.

22:51.917 --> 22:53.000
I'LL NEVER
GO THROUGH LIFE

22:53.000 --> 22:58.083
DOUBTING THAT MY FATHER
LOVED ME, JO, BUT...

22:58.083 --> 23:01.917
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH IT SUCKS

23:01.917 --> 23:04.625
TO KNOW THAT MY FATHER
WAS DISAPPOINTED IN ME
THE DAY HE DIED?

23:07.208 --> 23:10.291
AND HE WAS RIGHT.
I WAS ACTING CRAZY
LIKE A SPOILED BRAT,

23:10.291 --> 23:12.375
AND IF
I'D LISTENED TO HIM,

23:12.375 --> 23:13.375
HE WOULD'VE BEEN
DRIVING ME
TO THE AIRPORT

23:13.375 --> 23:15.083
INSTEAD OF DRIVING
TO HIS DEATH.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.959

I PRAYED THE GOOD LORD
WOULD TAKE ME FIRST.

23:46.375 --> 23:48.583
I NEVER WANTED
TO GO ON WITHOUT HIM.

23:48.583 --> 23:51.041
I DIDN'T THINK
I WAS CAPABLE OF IT.

23:51.041 --> 23:53.834
BUT SOMEHOW, I WAS.

23:53.834 --> 23:57.583
IT WASN'T EASY,
BUT INEVITABLY
THERE COMES A DAY

23:57.583 --> 24:00.542
THAT ISN'T AS BAD
AS THE ONE BEFORE IT.

24:00.542 --> 24:01.750
AND UNTIL THEN?
