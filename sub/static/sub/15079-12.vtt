10:22.242 --> 10:23.623
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE'S A FUGITIVE?

10:23.623 --> 10:24.795
WHAT DO THEY THINK
HE DID?

10:24.795 --> 10:26.086
HE MURDERED
A DRUG DEALER.

10:26.086 --> 10:27.878
MY BROTHER DID NOT MURDER
ANYBODY!

10:27.878 --> 10:30.300
COME ON!
THIS IS STUPID!
THAT'S ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU, SON.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.552
HEY, DEPUTY DAWG, THE LEAST
THING THEY COULD DO IS TAKE
OFF THE DAMN HANDCUFFS!

10:32.552 --> 10:34.174
WHO'S THIS GUY?
DR. PIERCE.

10:34.174 --> 10:36.256
THIS IS HIS HOUSE.
HE'S THE ONE WHO ALERTED ME.

10:36.256 --> 10:38.098
YOU DID WHAT?!

10:38.098 --> 10:40.971
MAX, ALL DANIEL DID
WAS COME TO ME WITH QUESTIONS.

10:40.971 --> 10:43.433
WHEN WE FOUND OUT THERE WAS
A WARRANT OUT FOR KENNY,

10:43.433 --> 10:44.975
I COULDN'T SIT
ON THAT INFORMATION.

10:44.975 --> 10:46.767
WELL, THAT INFORMATION
IS WRONG.

10:46.767 --> 10:49.609
AND YOU MADE A MISTAKE, BUT I
GUESS YOU'RE GOOD AT DOING THAT.

10:49.609 --> 10:51.441
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
WE'RE TAKING YOU IN.

10:51.441 --> 10:53.323
AIDING AND ABETTING
A FUGITIVE. LET'S GO.

10:53.323 --> 10:54.985
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
THIS IS BULLSHIT!

10:54.985 --> 10:56.907
HEY!
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

10:56.907 --> 10:58.328
STAY CALM.

10:58.328 --> 11:00.450
MAX,
I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

11:06.046 --> 11:08.288
Donnie: SO, WHAT ARE YOU
ASKING ME TO DO?

11:08.288 --> 11:09.629
Kate:
I WANT YOU TO GO DOWNSTAIRS,

11:09.629 --> 11:11.631
TELL THOSE MORONS
TO CUT LEWICKI LOOSE.

11:11.631 --> 11:13.593
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
THE GUY'S INNOCENT?

11:13.593 --> 11:16.296
OH, COME ON, DONNIE.
YOU KNOW HOW THOSE GUYS CAN BE.

11:16.296 --> 11:18.298
THEY'RE EMBARRASSED
THEY ARRESTED THE WRONG GUY,

11:18.298 --> 11:20.100
SO THEY HAULED MAX IN
TO SAVE FACE.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.432
[ SIGHS ]
THIS ISN'T MY CASE.

11:22.432 --> 11:26.266
YES, BUT YOU ARE
THE ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY.

11:26.266 --> 11:28.608
COME ON, CAN'T YOU JUST
GO DOWN THERE,

11:28.608 --> 11:30.941
WHIP OUT YOUR CREDENTIALS,
SHOW 'EM WHOSE ARE BIGGER?

11:30.941 --> 11:33.113
[ SIGHS ]

11:33.113 --> 11:34.614
Kate: MAX.

11:34.614 --> 11:37.317
Max: THANKS
FOR GETTING ME OUT.

11:37.317 --> 11:38.949
WELL, THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE
TAKEN YOU IN.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.871
ANY WORD ON KENNY?

11:40.871 --> 11:42.412
HE'S STILL AT LARGE.

11:42.412 --> 11:44.664
NO OFFENSE, BUT THAT MAKES KENNY
SOUND LIKE A CRIMINAL,

11:44.664 --> 11:45.996
AND I'M REAL TIRED
OF HEARING THAT.

11:45.996 --> 11:47.457
MAX, I'M SORRY.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.169
THAT MARSHAL KEPT BADGERING ME
ABOUT KENNY,

11:49.169 --> 11:50.710
BUT HE WOULDN'T TELL ME
ANYTHING.

11:53.884 --> 11:55.796
THE VICTIM
WAS A DRUG DEALER.

11:55.796 --> 11:57.637
HIS NAME WAS
BOOTSIE SMITH.

11:57.637 --> 11:59.719
HE WAS SHOT
AT POINT-BLANK RANGE

11:59.719 --> 12:02.432
THIS PAST WEEKEND
OVER IN ROCKFORD.

12:02.432 --> 12:04.895
AT THIS STAGE,
KENNY'S OUR SOLE SUSPECT.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.649
FROM WHAT WE KNOW,
HE'S BEEN ON THE RUN FOR
GOING ON FOUR DAYS NOW.

12:09.649 --> 12:11.311
SO, SOMEONE SAW KENNY
SHOOT THIS GUY?

12:11.311 --> 12:14.484
NO, BUT A WEAPON
WAS RECOVERED AT THE SCENE.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.906
THEN HOW DO THEY KNOW
IT WAS KENNY'S?

12:15.906 --> 12:17.487
GUN WAS WIPED CLEAN,

12:17.487 --> 12:19.990
BUT HIS PRINTS WERE FOUND
ON THE SHELL CASINGS.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.701
WELL, WAIT --
WAIT A MINUTE.

12:21.701 --> 12:23.163
FINGERPRINTS ON THE SHELL CASING
DOESN'T MEAN HE FIRED THE GUN.

12:23.163 --> 12:24.865
ANYBODY COULD HAVE FIRED
THAT GUN.

12:24.865 --> 12:26.746
BESIDES, KENNY WOULDN'T BE
MIXED UP WITH A DRUG DEALER,

12:26.746 --> 12:27.788
NEVER MIND SHOOT ONE.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.501
MAX, KENNY'S BEEN WORKING
AS A CORNER BOY

12:31.501 --> 12:33.173
FOR A GUY
NAMED EARL FRANKLIN.

12:33.173 --> 12:36.086
FRANKLIN IS ONE OF
THE BIGGEST DRUG KINGPINS

IN ALL OF ILLINOIS.

FOR A RIVAL CREW.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.686

THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

12:46.686 --> 12:48.558
AS WELL
AS YOU THOUGHT YOU DID.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.813
I AM SORRY.

12:55.986 --> 12:57.067

12:57.067 --> 12:58.318
MAX.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:58.318 --> 12:59.860
TO FIND KENNY
BEFORE THEY KILL HIM.

12:59.860 --> 13:01.862
TAKE A BREATH, LEWICKI.
YOU'VE HAD A ROUGH DAY.

13:01.862 --> 13:03.573
OH, REALLY?

13:03.573 --> 13:05.365
YOU THINK
TODAY IS THE FIRST TIME

13:05.365 --> 13:07.207
I'VE BEEN BUSTED
FOR BEING BLACK?

13:07.207 --> 13:08.708
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY TIMES

13:08.708 --> 13:11.621
I'VE BEEN STOPPED BY COPS
FOR NO GOOD REASON?

13:11.621 --> 13:13.964
EVER WONDER
WHY I DRESS THE WAY I DO?

13:13.964 --> 13:17.547
WOULD I LIKE TO WEAR A HOODIE
COMING HOME FROM THE GYM?

13:17.547 --> 13:19.469
YEAH, I WOULD,
BUT I DON'T.

13:19.469 --> 13:21.181
I PUT ON A DAMN TIE
AND SWEATER VEST

13:21.181 --> 13:22.843
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO BE HASSLED!

13:22.843 --> 13:24.424
SORRY.
I-I DIDN'T REALIZE.

13:24.424 --> 13:25.886
LOOK, I'M GOING TO ROCKFORD
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:25.886 --> 13:27.347
WELL, THEN GET KATE
TO GO WITH YOU.

13:27.347 --> 13:28.979

DON'T TALK TO COPS.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.600
THEY MIGHT TALK TO ME.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.392
THEN I-I'M CANCELING MY CLASSES
AND GOING WITH YOU MYSELF.

13:32.392 --> 13:34.314
THANKS, DOC, BUT YOU'D STICK OUT
LIKE A SORE THUMB.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.896
OH, 'CAUSE I'M WHITE.

13:35.896 --> 13:38.198
NO, BECAUSE SOMETIMES
YOU CAN BE A BIT ERRATIC.

13:38.198 --> 13:39.239
OH, I'M ERRATIC?

13:39.239 --> 13:40.610
AT THE MOMENT, LEWICKI,

13:40.610 --> 13:42.742
THAT'S LIKE THE POT
CALLING THE KETTLE --

13:44.034 --> 13:45.535
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

13:45.535 --> 13:47.247
Mr. Trotter: I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT WE TOLD THE MARSHALS.

13:47.247 --> 13:49.249
WE HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD
FROM KENNY SINCE LAST WEEK.

13:49.249 --> 13:51.041
OKAY, BUT HE'S BEEN GONE
FOR FOUR DAYS,

13:51.041 --> 13:53.713
AND YOU DON'T BOTHER
TO REPORT HIM AS A RUNAWAY?

13:53.713 --> 13:55.255
HEY, LISTEN.
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT,

13:55.255 --> 13:57.047
WE COULD HAVE
THREE TO FOUR FOSTER KIDS.

13:57.047 --> 13:59.009
WE CAN'T GO CALLING
SOCIAL SERVICES EVERY TIME

13:59.009 --> 14:00.670

TO BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.

14:00.670 --> 14:02.462
RIGHT.

14:02.462 --> 14:04.464
BESIDES, IF YOU REPORT KENNY
GONE, BYE-BYE, BENEFIT CHECK.

THE BEST THAT WE CAN.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.019

SET LIMITS.

14:09.019 --> 14:11.101
BUT KENNY'S A TEENAGER.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.522
LIKE A LOT OF TEENAGERS,

14:12.522 --> 14:14.184

ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.

14:14.184 --> 14:16.646
OKAY, SO BLAME HIM
FOR YOUR LACK OF SUPERVISION.

WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

14:18.188 --> 14:20.110

TO CHECK ON YOUR BROTHER?

14:31.581 --> 14:33.453

IF THAT WAS JUST A STORY

14:33.453 --> 14:35.295
OR IF THERE WAS ANYTHING
TO IT.

14:35.295 --> 14:37.587
I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM
TALK ABOUT THAT.

14:37.587 --> 14:39.299
WELL,
HOW ABOUT A GIRLFRIEND?

14:39.299 --> 14:41.551

GIRLFRIENDS. THEY RUN IN PACKS.

ANY OTHER FRIENDS?

14:43.463 --> 14:44.965
YEAH.

14:44.965 --> 14:47.217
HE HAD THIS ONE FRIEND --
HE WOULD COME OVER A LOT,

14:47.217 --> 14:49.139
WOULD BOUNCE THE BASKETBALL
IN THE HOUSE.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.810
DROVE ME CRAZY.

14:50.810 --> 14:51.811
YOU REMEMBER HIM?

14:51.811 --> 14:53.223
OH, YEAH.

14:53.223 --> 14:54.604
I WANTED KENNY
TO HANG OUT WITH HIM MORE.

14:54.604 --> 14:56.937
NICE KID. HELL OF A BALLPLAYER,
I GUESS.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.438

OH, MAN.

15:13.833 --> 15:14.955
YOU'RE MAX, HUH?

15:16.666 --> 15:17.797
KENNY BRAGGED ON YOU
A LOT.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.002
IS HE A COP?

15:22.002 --> 15:23.843
HE'S A SCIENCE

GIVE ME THE SHIRT OFF HIS BACK.

HE SHOT THAT DUDE,

I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO HEAR SOMEONE SAY THAT.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.691

MIXED UP WITH SOME DEALERS?

15:41.691 --> 15:43.153

NOT TO QUIT PLAYING BALL.

HE WOULD PLAY,

I TALKED TO HIM
THIS MORNING.

15:57.127 --> 15:58.288
WHERE WAS HE?

15:58.288 --> 15:59.919
I DON'T KNOW.
MAN, HE WAS HYPED.

15:59.919 --> 16:02.462
ALL HE SAID IS HE WAS TAKING IT
ONE DAY AT A TIME,

16:02.462 --> 16:05.175
AND TODAY HE WAS GOING SWIMMING,
AND HE HUNG UP.

16:05.175 --> 16:07.717

HOW MANY BLACK KIDS YOU KNOW
KNOW HOW TO SWIM?

16:07.717 --> 16:11.091
THAT IS

16:17.557 --> 16:19.559
OKAY, YOU SAID
HE WAS GOING SWIMMING?

16:19.559 --> 16:21.521
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
ABOUT RACE, PAL.

16:21.521 --> 16:24.774

16:24.774 --> 16:26.406

KNOW HOW TO SWIM?

HE SAID WHEN HE WAS
LITTLE, YOU TOOK HIM

LIVED TOGETHER,

THIS FIRE HYDRANT ON HOT DAYS.

16:43.543 --> 16:45.295

"GOING SWIMMING."

REMEMBER THAT ONE TIME

17:04.524 --> 17:06.446
WHEN THE WATER SPRAY
SHOT OUT SO HARD,

17:06.446 --> 17:09.609

TURN YOURSELF IN, KENNY.

STOP RUNNING.

MAKE YOU LOOK GUILTY, KENNY.

17:39.389 --> 17:41.731
NO.

17:41.731 --> 17:43.393
NOT TO ME.

17:55.615 --> 17:57.867
KENNY, MR. BAUER'S
ONE OF THE BEST LAWYERS IN TOWN.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.369
HE WON A LOT
OF BIG CASES.

17:59.369 --> 18:03.042
SO JUST TELL HIM
WHAT YOU TOLD US.

18:03.042 --> 18:06.336
THERE'S THIS GUY --
DARIUS.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.047
HE'S A BIG DOG.

18:08.047 --> 18:11.131
HE SAID IF I WANTED TO MOVE UP,
HE HAD A JOB FOR ME --

18:11.131 --> 18:12.802
GO RIP OFF BOOTSIE.

18:12.802 --> 18:14.804
HE'D BE GOING BY
TO KICK IT WITH HIS GIRL

18:14.804 --> 18:16.306
AND HOLDING A LOT OF CASH.

18:16.306 --> 18:17.977
THE TRICK WAS,
NO ONE KNEW WHEN,

18:17.977 --> 18:19.639
SO I HAD TO GO THERE
AND WAIT.

18:19.639 --> 18:20.930
WAIT WHERE?

18:20.930 --> 18:22.932
A WINDOW WELL
ACROSS FROM HIS GIRL'S CRIB.

18:22.932 --> 18:24.484
I HID DOWN THERE.

18:24.484 --> 18:26.646
OKAY, SO, THEN BOOTSIE SHOWS UP,
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

18:26.646 --> 18:28.818
NO, NO. I WISH.

18:28.818 --> 18:31.731
LIKE SEVEN HOURS GO BY,
AND BOOTSIE'S STILL A NO-SHOW.

18:31.731 --> 18:34.234
IT WAS LIKE 5:00 IN THE MORNING.
I WAS WRECKED.

18:34.234 --> 18:36.696
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO FORGET
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING,

18:36.696 --> 18:39.118
BUT THEN DARIUS CAME.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.500
I TOLD HIM I WANTED OUT,

18:40.500 --> 18:42.242
BUT HE SAID
IT WAS TOO LATE FOR THAT.

18:42.242 --> 18:45.795
HE SAID NOT TO WORRY, THOUGH --
HE HAD MY BACK.

18:45.795 --> 18:48.248
RIGHT THEN, BOOTSIE CAME WALKING
AROUND THE CORNER,

18:48.248 --> 18:50.750
SO ME AND DARIUS
JET ACROSS THE STREET.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.592
I GUESS
HE MUST HAVE HEARD US COMING,

18:52.592 --> 18:55.134
BECAUSE HE TURNED AROUND AND
SLAPPED THE GUN OUT OF MY HAND.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.676
NEXT THING I KNOW,

18:56.676 --> 18:58.928
I'M ON THE GROUND,
GETTING KICKED IN THE HEAD.

18:58.928 --> 19:00.520
AND THAT'S
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.761
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:01.761 --> 19:03.313
BOOTSIE PULLED OUT
HIS GUN,

19:03.313 --> 19:05.565
AND DARIUS SNATCHED UP
THE GUN THAT I DROPPED,

19:05.565 --> 19:06.976
AND HE SHOT BOOTSIE.

19:20.620 --> 19:23.873
WELL, THEY DID GIVE ME THE GUN,
AND I DID LOAD IT,

19:23.873 --> 19:26.165
BUT I GUESS
DARIUS MUST HAVE WIPED IT DOWN.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.837
YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM
WIPE THE GUN?

19:27.837 --> 19:29.879
WELL, I THINK I BLACKED OUT
FOR A QUICK MINUTE

19:29.879 --> 19:31.211
BECAUSE
WHEN I GOT ON MY FEET,

19:31.211 --> 19:32.752
DARIUS HAD LEFT ME THERE
ALL ALONE.

19:34.053 --> 19:36.005
SO, WE'RE GONNA MAKE A DEAL,
RIGHT?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.640

AS HIS STORY HOLDS UP.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.142

GUESS I'LL GO PICK UP DARIUS.

19:43.142 --> 19:45.435
KENNY'S TRYING
TO BE SLICK, HUH?

19:45.435 --> 19:47.517
HE'S TRYING
TO PIN THAT MURDER ON ME?

19:47.517 --> 19:49.229
THAT'S THE HEADLINE.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.401
GOOD LUCK MAKING IT STICK,
SHORTY.

DARIUS HAS AN ALIBI.

19:56.736 --> 19:58.318

AT AN AFTER-HOURS CLUB,

19:58.318 --> 20:00.910
HOSTING A LAUNCH PARTY
FOR A NEW RECORD LABEL.

20:00.910 --> 20:03.493
HE WAS THERE ALL NIGHT
WITH 120 PEOPLE.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.994
HE DIDN'T LEAVE
UNTIL 7:00 A.M.

20:04.994 --> 20:06.706

AFTER THE SHOOTING.

BUT UNLESS

THAT I'M JUST NOT SEEING...

MAYBE THERE IS.

TALKING ABOUT?

20:14.424 --> 20:15.925
I'M NOT SURE,
BUT I-I...

20:15.925 --> 20:18.217
I HAVE TO TALK
TO KENNY FIRST.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.343

FOR SEVEN HOURS.

20:23.343 --> 20:25.224

ALL THAT TIME?

20:25.224 --> 20:27.477
MAN, I TOLD YOU THE STORY
LIKE THREE TIMES ALREADY.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.900
KENNY, I'M TRYING TO HELP HERE,
BUT I NEED TO KNOW MORE,

20:30.900 --> 20:33.403
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THIS IS NOT
LOOKING GOOD FOR YOU.

20:34.944 --> 20:36.446
THERE'S ONLY
TWO THINGS TO DO --

20:36.446 --> 20:38.658
STAY ON THE LOOKOUT
AND TRY AND GET COMFORTABLE.

20:38.658 --> 20:40.860
AT FIRST, I WAS COOL.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.202
BUT BOOTSIE
WAS JUST NOT SHOWING UP.

20:43.202 --> 20:44.744
AND AFTER A WHILE,

20:44.744 --> 20:46.416
IT GOT REAL TOUGH
STAYING DOWN THERE IN THAT HOLE.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.958
WHAT DID YOU DO ABOUT FOOD?
DID YOU DRINK ANYTHING?

20:48.958 --> 20:50.670
I DIDN'T BRING ANYTHING
TO EAT OR DRINK.

20:50.670 --> 20:52.462
I DIDN'T THINK
I'D BE THERE FOR THAT LONG.

20:52.462 --> 20:54.674
I WISH I'D BROUGHT SOME WATER.
MY LEGS WERE CRAMPING.

20:54.674 --> 20:56.636
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG YOU'D GONE
WITHOUT SLEEP?

20:56.636 --> 20:59.799
COUNTING THE NIGHT BEFORE,
I'D SAY, LIKE, 28 HOURS.

20:59.799 --> 21:00.930
WERE YOU ON ANYTHING?

21:00.930 --> 21:02.432
I DON'T DO NO DRUGS.

21:02.432 --> 21:03.723
SO HOW DID YOU STAY ALERT?

21:03.723 --> 21:06.516
THE DANGER, I GUESS.

21:06.516 --> 21:08.438
I HATE THE DARK
AS IT IS.

21:08.438 --> 21:10.560
IT...MAKES YOU
FEEL LONELY.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.892
AND I KNEW I DIDN'T HAVE
THE NERVE TO ROB THAT GUY.

21:12.892 --> 21:14.153
I JUST WANTED TO LEAVE.

21:14.153 --> 21:15.815
AND THAT'S
WHEN DARIUS SHOWED UP.

21:15.815 --> 21:17.657
THEN I WASN'T GOING
ANYWHERE.

21:17.657 --> 21:19.489
AND HE'S, WHAT,
A TOUGH GUY?

21:19.489 --> 21:22.201

NOTHING BUGS HIM.

21:22.201 --> 21:23.823
WHERE DID HE COME FROM?

21:23.823 --> 21:25.204
WHAT?

21:25.204 --> 21:27.327
HOW DID HE GET THERE?
A CAR? ON FOOT?

21:27.327 --> 21:29.869
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WAS JUST THERE.

21:31.831 --> 21:33.002
KENNY ISN'T LYING.

21:33.002 --> 21:34.914
I KNEW IT.
BUT I THINK HE DID IT.

21:34.914 --> 21:36.416
WHAT?

21:36.416 --> 21:38.338
I THINK
KENNY EXPERIENCED A PHENOMENON

21:38.338 --> 21:40.179
KNOWN AS
SENSED-PRESENCE EFFECT.

21:40.179 --> 21:42.051

THEY CAN ALL
BRING THIS ON.

21:49.849 --> 21:52.982
SO, DARIUS WASN'T THERE,
BUT KENNY THINKS HE WAS

21:52.982 --> 21:55.435
BECAUSE HIS BRAIN
CONJURED UP HIS PRESENCE

SO TRAUMATIZED BY WHAT HE'D DONE

SOLELY A MYTH.

THERE IS
SOME GOOD SCIENCE

BEHIND THE IDEA
OF CROSS-RACIAL BIAS.

AS A WITNESS

TALKING ABOUT CROSS-RACIAL BIAS

29:49.788 --> 29:51.500
BEFORE THE LINEUP.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.503
BESIDES, SEN LI JUST LOOKED
AT 10 AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN

PICKED OUT

IN THIS CASE.

"TURN AROUND."

30:14.353 --> 30:16.525

LOOKING AT THOSE MEN FROM BEHIND

30:16.525 --> 30:18.197

AROUND THE BACK OF SHOES.

30:25.744 --> 30:27.947

I SEE MANY KIDS,

30:27.947 --> 30:31.330
BUT NO ONE ELSE
TIE SHOE THIS WAY.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.042
SO, ON THE NIGHT
OF THE SHOOTING,

30:33.042 --> 30:35.875
EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW.

30:35.875 --> 30:39.718

30:48.727 --> 30:51.560

30:51.560 --> 30:54.733
BUT THEN
I SEE SHOELACES

30:54.733 --> 30:58.647
FLOPPING BEHIND BOY
AS HE RUN.

30:58.647 --> 31:00.279
THANK YOU, MR. LI.

31:02.741 --> 31:04.483
WELL,
THE I.D. WON'T HOLD UP,

31:04.483 --> 31:07.866
BUT ONCE AGAIN, WE HAVE PROVED
THAT KENNY WAS THE SHOOTER.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.659
ALL THAT PROVES IS,
THIS GUY SAW KENNY RUNNING AWAY.

31:10.659 --> 31:12.251
WELL,
THEN KENNY LIED AGAIN.

31:12.251 --> 31:15.084
ACCORDING TO HIS STATEMENT,
WHEN HE FLED THE SCENE,

31:15.084 --> 31:17.126
HE RAN OFF
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

31:17.126 --> 31:19.088
UNLESS HE ISN'T LYING.

31:19.088 --> 31:21.550
ASSUME THAT KENNY DID RUN OFF
IN THE DIRECTION HE SAYS.

31:21.550 --> 31:23.963
SO IT WAS DARIUS
WHO MR. LI SAW RUNNING AWAY?

31:23.963 --> 31:26.966
MAYBE, YOU KNOW, IF DARIUS TIES
HIS SHOELACES THE SAME WAY.

31:29.508 --> 31:31.850
I GOT I.D.'d
OFF MY SHOESTRINGS.

31:31.850 --> 31:35.564

IT'S NOT BAD.

31:35.564 --> 31:37.646

HAS A NEW THEORY.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.478
WHAT NEW THEORY?

SHE'S TRYING TO PROVE
THAT DARIUS TIED HIS
SHOELACES LIKE YOU DO.

31:41.230 --> 31:43.902
OH. WELL, YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.945
OKAY, SO MAYBE
IT WASN'T DARIUS.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.987
MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE
SHOT BOOTSIE.

31:47.987 --> 31:49.658
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE ANY SENSE?

31:49.658 --> 31:51.700

THAT YOU WERE DAZED.

THAT SHOT HIM.

I WASN'T ABOUT TO
LET YOU GO AWAY

38:57.916 --> 38:59.628
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
FOR SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO.

38:59.628 --> 39:02.631
CHARLIE SAVED MY LIFE!

39:02.631 --> 39:04.803
NOW HE'S GOT TO PAY
FOR THAT?!

39:04.803 --> 39:07.636
HE HAD A 3.7 GPA!
HE SLEPT WITH HIS BASKETBALL!

39:07.636 --> 39:09.768
EVERYTHING HE DID WAS SO THAT
HE COULD GO TO NOTRE DAME!

39:09.768 --> 39:12.471
LISTEN, IF YOU TESTIFY
ON CHARLIE'S BEHALF,

39:12.471 --> 39:14.733
MR. BAUER THINKS
HE CAN COP A PLEA.

39:14.733 --> 39:16.935
LOOK, IT'S NOT OVER FOR HIM,
EITHER, KENNY.

39:16.935 --> 39:20.148
LOOK, HIM SPENDING EVEN ONE DAY
IN JAIL BECAUSE OF ME

39:20.148 --> 39:21.319
IS A WASTE.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.612
MY LIFE
AIN'T WORTH NOTHING.

39:23.612 --> 39:24.983
LISTEN, YOU SHUT
YOUR DAMN MOUTH. OKAY?

39:24.983 --> 39:26.865
YOU DON'T EVER SAY THAT AGAIN.
YOU HEAR ME?

39:26.865 --> 39:28.286
MAX,
I'VE BLOWN MY CHANCES!

39:28.286 --> 39:29.448
NO, YOU HAVE NOT!

39:29.448 --> 39:31.199
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
FOR ANYTHING!

39:32.791 --> 39:35.454
ALL RIGHT. SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,
I GET OUT.

39:35.454 --> 39:36.955
THEN WHAT?

39:36.955 --> 39:39.257
YOU GET BACK ON TRACK.
YOU GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

39:39.257 --> 39:41.339
BACK TO ROCKFORD?

39:41.339 --> 39:43.592
DARIUS IS OVER THERE
WAITING FOR ME!

39:43.592 --> 39:45.504
THEN HOW DOES
FLORIDA SOUND?

39:45.504 --> 39:46.635
FLORIDA?

39:46.635 --> 39:47.806
YEAH.

39:47.806 --> 39:49.558
THE LEWICKIS RETIRED
DOWN THERE.

39:49.558 --> 39:51.139
I TOLD THEM
WHAT'S GOING ON,

39:51.139 --> 39:52.811
AND THEY WANT YOU TO COME
LIVE WITH THEM, KENNY.

39:52.811 --> 39:56.014
MAX, I DON'T WANT TO GO LIVE
WITH NO OLD PEOPLE.

39:57.355 --> 39:59.317
WHERE IN FLORIDA?

39:59.317 --> 40:00.689
SOUTH BEACH?

40:00.689 --> 40:02.150
MIDDLEBURG.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.282
OH, MAN.

40:12.831 --> 40:14.833
[ TAPPING ]

40:14.833 --> 40:16.034
MR. LEWICKI.

40:16.034 --> 40:18.246
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

40:18.246 --> 40:21.209
I'VE...CHANGED MY MIND
ABOUT THAT FELLOWSHIP.

40:21.209 --> 40:23.301
MM.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

40:23.301 --> 40:24.633
MAYBE NEXT YEAR.

40:24.633 --> 40:26.214
I RESPECT YOUR LOYALTY
TO DR. PIERCE,

40:26.214 --> 40:27.546
BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO START

40:27.546 --> 40:29.097
THINKING ABOUT
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU

40:29.097 --> 40:31.850
AND NOT WHAT'S NECESSARILY RIGHT
FOR EVERYONE ELSE.

40:31.850 --> 40:32.851
HMM?

40:32.851 --> 40:34.392
YEAH.

40:35.514 --> 40:36.685
BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.

40:38.226 --> 40:40.058
I'VE GOT TOO MANY
OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES.

40:42.731 --> 40:43.902
THANKS.

40:45.484 --> 40:49.407
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HAVING
A LARGER ORBITOPREFRONTAL CORTEX

40:49.407 --> 40:52.160
CORRELATES
TO HAVING MORE FRIENDS,

40:52.160 --> 40:56.164
WHICH PROVES ONCE AND FOR ALL
THAT...SIZE MATTERS.

40:56.164 --> 40:57.335
[ LAUGHTER ]

40:57.335 --> 40:58.917
THAT'S NOT ALL THAT MATTERS.

40:58.917 --> 41:01.039
WHAT KIND OF FRIENDS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

41:01.039 --> 41:03.672
WORK FRIENDS,
INTERNET FRIENDS...

41:03.672 --> 41:05.584
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS?

41:05.584 --> 41:07.255
[ LAUGHTER ]

41:07.255 --> 41:09.467
FRIENDS WHO PUT UP
WITH YOUR GARBAGE...

41:15.093 --> 41:16.935
...OR A BEST FRIEND?

41:16.935 --> 41:20.098
COMMON SENSE TELLS US THAT THE
MORE YOU NURTURE A FRIENDSHIP,

41:20.098 --> 41:21.730
THE DEEPER IT GROWS.

41:21.730 --> 41:25.734
CONVERSELY, IF YOU NEGLECT IT,
IT'S BOUND TO FADE AWAY,

41:25.734 --> 41:29.107
UNLESS YOUR FRIEND
HAPPENS TO BE FAMILY.

41:29.107 --> 41:30.609
IN WHICH CASE,

41:30.609 --> 41:32.871
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH
STUCK WITH THEM...

41:32.871 --> 41:33.872
NO MATTER WHAT.
