00:03.458 --> 00:06.583
[opening theme music playing]

00:31.416 --> 00:33.708
Good evening.
The sudden resurgence

00:33.708 --> 00:36.458
in anti-mutant activity
continued today.

00:36.458 --> 00:38.958
Across the state,
police were again brought in

00:38.958 --> 00:41.291
to escort mutant
students to class.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.708
Any show of sympathy
for the mutants is risky,

00:43.708 --> 00:45.708
as this amateur video shows.

00:45.708 --> 00:48.500
Meanwhile, anti-mutant
spokesman, Graydon Creed,

00:48.500 --> 00:51.875
was brought from seclusion
to testify before Congress.

00:51.875 --> 00:54.833
While I deny any involvement
in these actions,

00:54.833 --> 00:58.375
patriotic human beings
everywhere
support vigilant efforts

00:58.375 --> 01:00.208
to remove the mutant blight!

01:00.208 --> 01:02.708
-No more mutants!
-No more mutants!

01:02.708 --> 01:07.291
Mr. Creed, if these outbursts
continue, I will hold you
in contempt!

01:07.291 --> 01:10.416
The feeling, madam, is mutual.

01:10.416 --> 01:13.875
This meeting of the Friends
of Humanity High Command

01:13.875 --> 01:16.083
is called to order.

01:16.083 --> 01:21.875
First, let us warmly welcome
back our founder,
Graydon Creed.

01:21.875 --> 01:24.000
Thank you. Now that I am back,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.458
I'm ready to resume my position
as your commander.

01:27.458 --> 01:31.458
You? Who've been drooling
in your tin cup for a year?

01:31.458 --> 01:33.416
Who nearly destroyed us?

01:33.416 --> 01:36.875
-The council rules here now!
-This is treason!

01:36.875 --> 01:39.500
The Friends of Humanity
is my creation!

01:39.500 --> 01:42.416
You lied about your mutant
parentage.

01:42.416 --> 01:47.000
You brought the stain
of Sabretooth into our lives!

01:47.000 --> 01:50.458
That name! Every night
in the hospital,
I'd lie in bed,

01:50.458 --> 01:54.000
I'd see that face
in the darkness, that awful...

01:54.000 --> 01:57.333
Isn't my shame punishment
enough?

01:57.333 --> 02:01.458
What do I need to do
to show you that I am still one
of you?

02:01.458 --> 02:03.583
Our research shows

02:03.583 --> 02:07.291
that the corruption of your
blood does not end with
Sabretooth.

02:07.291 --> 02:08.416
Read it.

02:13.416 --> 02:18.875
No! No! It isn't true!

02:18.875 --> 02:24.750
Oh, but it is. Your family tree
bears much poisonous mutant
fruit.

02:24.750 --> 02:28.083
Wait! If I prove my loyalty...

02:28.083 --> 02:33.500
What if I deliver these freaks,
these mutant abominations
to you?

02:33.500 --> 02:36.458
-We could eliminate them all!
-Go on.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.833
[laughing]

02:48.333 --> 02:51.333
-Trick or treat!
-Trick or treat!

02:51.333 --> 02:53.875
OK, I choose trick!

03:02.458 --> 03:07.875
Oh, nice. Beast won't
appreciate you using his face
to give them nightmares.

03:07.875 --> 03:10.208
Isn't that what
Halloween's all about?

03:10.208 --> 03:13.416
No, it's about getting people
to give you lots of candy,

03:13.416 --> 03:16.000
and then trying to eat it all
in one night.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.625
What's bugging you?

03:17.625 --> 03:19.708
Every year, it's the same.

03:19.708 --> 03:23.291
Bunch of brats run around
dressed like monsters
and mutants.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.708
Everybody says, "How cute."

03:25.708 --> 03:28.583
Then next day,
they get to go back to normal.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.000
Where do we go?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.291
Hey, lighten up, grump.

03:34.125 --> 03:37.291
No wonder everybody else got
smart and took the night off.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.625
Uh, what do you say I answer
this time?

03:41.625 --> 03:46.500
Midget monsters. Dime store
demons.You ask me,
the whole thing's sick.

03:49.250 --> 03:50.250
Happy Hallow...

03:51.458 --> 03:55.416
Come on, how scary
can a bunch of kids be?

03:55.416 --> 03:56.958
Nightcrawler!

03:56.958 --> 04:00.208
Wolverine! Please,
I need your help.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.583
I received
a letter at the monastery.

04:04.583 --> 04:08.625
It says that if I do not come,
they will hurt my mother.

04:08.625 --> 04:10.375
Who would do such a thing?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.875
-Who's "they?"
-I have no idea.
It is not signed.

04:13.875 --> 04:15.958
Have you called your mother
at the circus?

04:15.958 --> 04:17.958
No. No, not that mother.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.250
The Wagners who own the circus,
my adoptive parents, are fine.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.708
The letter is from my birth
mother.

04:23.708 --> 04:26.583
I thought your mum ditched you
when you were a baby.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.833
How do you know this is legit?

04:28.833 --> 04:31.833
The handwriting in the letter
matches the one
she left for me long ago.

04:31.833 --> 04:35.458
"Come alone
or the consequences
could be fatal."

04:35.458 --> 04:37.625
Do you know of anybody
who'd want to hurt her?

04:37.625 --> 04:41.291
Of course not.
I didn't even know
she was still alive.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.708
She may not be.

04:42.708 --> 04:45.458
I don't know what to do.
I am overwhelmed.

04:45.458 --> 04:48.208
You X-Men are experienced
with such things.

04:48.208 --> 04:50.291
Well, you've come
to the right place, honey.

04:50.291 --> 04:54.333
Yeah, we've tangled
with just about
every jerk around.

04:54.333 --> 04:57.625
Somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble
to track you down.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.625
And use your mum to get to you.

04:59.625 --> 05:03.000
Who'd have his pants in a twist
over a blue-faced monk?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.583
I do not know.

05:04.583 --> 05:07.958
But if my mother is in danger,
I must help her.

05:07.958 --> 05:10.458
Either way, pal,
we're tagging along.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.291
But the letter said
I must go alone.

05:12.291 --> 05:15.416
Oh, you'll look alone,
but you won't be alone.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.958
Now let's get going.

05:16.958 --> 05:20.333
I just realized.
Kurt looks a lot like Beast.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.500
I wonder if they're related?

05:22.500 --> 05:26.333
Girl, that's about as likely
as Nightcrawler and me being
kin!

05:45.000 --> 05:47.875
-Can I talk to you a second?
-Of course, Fraulein .

05:47.875 --> 05:51.833
Rogue says the things
to Wolverine
meant a lot to him.

05:53.291 --> 05:55.750
Our time together
meant a great deal to both of
us.

05:56.333 --> 05:59.458
There's something I need to ask
you.

06:00.166 --> 06:03.583
I don't know who my parents are
either.

06:03.583 --> 06:06.166
I was never really adopted like
you.

06:06.166 --> 06:10.000
One family would have me for a
while,
then they'd get tired of me

06:10.000 --> 06:12.166
and I'd get put somewhere else.

06:12.750 --> 06:17.583
You know, I used to feel
like I didn't belong anywhere.

06:17.583 --> 06:21.166
We all feel like that
sometimes. Friends can help.

06:21.583 --> 06:23.708
But in our times of loneliness,

06:23.708 --> 06:26.500
we forget that we are all part
of a greater family,

06:26.500 --> 06:28.375
a family of God.

06:28.375 --> 06:32.125
All other comfort is fleeting.
Only God endures.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.583
That all sounds so nice.

06:34.583 --> 06:38.708
But what if this is your mom?
What'll you say?

06:38.708 --> 06:41.500
I mean, she dumped you
when you were a baby!

06:41.500 --> 06:44.166
-Aren't you mad?
-I suppose I am.

06:44.583 --> 06:48.375
But every day, I pray for the
lord to forgive my sins

06:48.375 --> 06:50.083
and to forgive the sins of
others.

06:50.083 --> 06:52.625
Even those who have done harm
to me.

06:52.625 --> 06:55.458
I... I don't think I could do
that.

06:55.458 --> 07:00.500
That is why I look to God
for help because we cannot do
it by ourselves.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.708
He can give you the strength to
forgive.

07:03.708 --> 07:07.625
[sighs] This religion stuff
is intense.

07:13.875 --> 07:16.291
This is looking way too easy.

07:18.875 --> 07:21.458
-I smell a rat.
-I shouldn't have brought you.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.500
If they see you,
they might hurt my mother.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.166
-I must go in alone.
-Now look, preacher.

07:26.166 --> 07:29.083
You risked your hide to save me
and Logan back at your
monastery.

07:29.083 --> 07:31.708
We can't just sit around
and watch you
walk into trouble.

07:31.708 --> 07:35.708
Just have a little faith, pal.
I hear it can work wonders.

07:36.708 --> 07:38.875
-Very well.
-All right.

07:38.875 --> 07:43.208
Now that we've worked all that
out, let's go visiting!

07:46.708 --> 07:48.083
Trick or treat!

07:48.083 --> 07:51.000
We have no candy here! Go away!

07:51.000 --> 07:53.208
Then I guess it's trick!

07:54.583 --> 07:55.708
Guten tag!

07:56.625 --> 08:01.250
Friends of Humanity!
I thought we'd gotten rid of
this filth!

08:01.250 --> 08:03.250
Who are these friends?

08:03.250 --> 08:07.083
The worst of the worst.
They live to get rid
of mutants.

08:07.083 --> 08:09.750
Man, I hope they don't have
your mom.

08:11.875 --> 08:15.625
How did we miss this place?
It's as big as their main
headquarters.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.333
Jubilee, you and me
are on diversion detail.

08:18.333 --> 08:21.583
Rogue, go with Nightcrawler.
Find his mum
and get her out of here!

08:21.583 --> 08:24.875
My friend, if something
should happen to me,

08:24.875 --> 08:27.458
I wish to thank you
for what you and the others are
doing.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.625
Don't worry about it, Kurt.
I owe you

08:29.625 --> 08:34.000
and besides,
I'd take on these lowlifes for
nothing!

08:40.458 --> 08:43.875
Whoa! Look at all this stuff!

08:43.875 --> 08:46.833
These guys must have
got a new credit card!

08:46.833 --> 08:49.625
It looks like
they're about to try something
big.

08:50.125 --> 08:52.208
Rogue! Any luck?

08:52.208 --> 08:56.416
Quiet as a church on Saturday
night.
Sorry, Nightcrawler.

08:56.416 --> 08:58.750
Then just find your mother
and get moving!

08:58.750 --> 09:01.000
Shouldn't we help them?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.250
They can take care of
themselves. You and me got
to help your mama.

09:04.250 --> 09:08.875
Help me. Someone please!

09:08.875 --> 09:13.166
Mother! I am... I am here!
I'll help you!

09:13.166 --> 09:16.125
Kurt! Hurry, son!

09:16.125 --> 09:19.125
Hold on! I know that voice!

09:19.875 --> 09:21.750
Wait! Don't go in!

09:29.875 --> 09:31.875
-Mother?
-Mystique?

09:31.875 --> 09:33.083
Rogue!

09:33.875 --> 09:35.833
I don't know
what tricks you're playing,
Mama,

09:35.833 --> 09:37.458
but nobody's touching
Nightcrawler!

09:37.458 --> 09:39.583
What are you doing here?
You'll ruin everything!

09:39.583 --> 09:41.875
They just want your brother!

09:41.875 --> 09:43.500
-Brother?
-Brother?

09:46.000 --> 09:49.375
-We're leaving!
-Rogue, please, I must know!

09:49.375 --> 09:52.708
Have you told us the truth
about being our mother?

09:52.708 --> 09:55.875
-There's no time for this!
-I must know!

09:55.875 --> 10:00.833
Dear little Kurt,
I always wondered how you'd
turn out.

10:01.458 --> 10:06.583
If you must know, I adopted
Rogue
when she was a young child.

10:06.583 --> 10:11.083
But before that, I bore two
children.
One of them was you.

10:11.083 --> 10:15.875
And the other,
I am sickened to admit, was me!

10:15.875 --> 10:17.875
Graydon Creed?

10:17.875 --> 10:22.000
Yes! It was bad enough
to find out that
Sabretooth is my father.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.208
But then to learn that these
freaks
are what's left of my family,

10:26.208 --> 10:29.708
it was enough to drive me mad!

10:29.708 --> 10:33.583
-You are my brother?
-Don't ever call me brother!

10:33.583 --> 10:37.583
Once I am rid of you all,
I will truly be cleansed!

10:37.583 --> 10:39.416
Free of your curse!

10:39.416 --> 10:43.166
If you are indeed my brother,
then I will pray to God

10:43.166 --> 10:46.291
that you find the wisdom
to work through your hatreds,

10:46.291 --> 10:48.833
to find strength in his love.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.375
Pretty words, for a demon!

10:55.750 --> 10:59.458
Mama, how could you hand over
your own son to a bunch
of mutant-haters?

10:59.458 --> 11:04.000
I did it for you, darling.
You know
you were always my favorite.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.416
Creed said
if I helped him get
Nightcrawler,

11:06.416 --> 11:09.458
the Friends of Humanity
wouldn't harm either of us.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.250
Don't soft-soap the girl!

11:11.250 --> 11:14.125
You were saving your own skin,
and nobody else's!

11:14.125 --> 11:18.000
This gas is perfect
for treating tap water,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.375
or eliminating unwanted
relatives.

11:20.875 --> 11:24.083
God forgive me and give me
strength.

11:28.208 --> 11:32.083
Stop this! She is our mother!
She gave you life!

11:32.083 --> 11:36.166
She is a mutant!
She gave me misery and shame!

11:36.166 --> 11:39.375
She has to suffer!
All mutants must suffer!

11:44.458 --> 11:48.291
Jubilee! Knock out those jets!

11:49.458 --> 11:51.416
Consider them toast!

11:55.000 --> 11:58.750
I do not wish to fight you,
brother.
Please let us talk.

11:59.625 --> 12:03.833
Then stand still, you
abomination!

12:04.875 --> 12:06.958
What kind of madman are you?

12:06.958 --> 12:10.125
All of these soldiers,
all of these weapons!

12:10.125 --> 12:14.458
We've started a little war,
my kind versus yours.

12:17.958 --> 12:19.583
What's Mystique doing here?

12:20.500 --> 12:24.833
She's Nightcrawler's mother!
And Creed's mother, too!

12:24.833 --> 12:27.833
Boy, talk about your soap
operas!

12:27.833 --> 12:31.416
-Where's Nightcrawler?
-Up there, with Creed!

12:41.625 --> 12:45.458
If I were you,
I'd stay away from family
reunions.

12:45.458 --> 12:48.958
-Time we got out of here!
-Not without Mystique!

12:48.958 --> 12:50.500
She's gone!

12:50.500 --> 12:54.000
Ah. Nothing more touching
than a mother's love.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.583
Which way did they go?

12:58.583 --> 13:00.458
Come on! They went this way!

13:01.500 --> 13:05.500
Rather dim, for saviors of
mankind.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.958
Pinheads got us
trapped in here.

13:15.708 --> 13:18.083
Rogue! Get with the program!

13:18.833 --> 13:21.708
I hear you! One exit coming up!

13:27.333 --> 13:31.625
If there's one thing I hate,
it's walking away from a good
fight.

13:32.583 --> 13:34.583
-Let her go, preacher!
-No!

13:34.583 --> 13:37.458
I have waited too long for this
moment!

13:37.458 --> 13:38.708
Not again!

13:56.458 --> 13:59.625
Doesn't look like
they're gonna let us just walk
away.

14:06.208 --> 14:11.125
[shouting] I didn't mean you
any harm! Don't hurt me!

14:11.125 --> 14:13.500
What do you want from me?

14:13.500 --> 14:18.583
The truth! I have lived
25 years and traveled
4,000 miles,

14:18.583 --> 14:20.875
wishing only to know the truth.

14:20.875 --> 14:23.333
All right then, the truth.

14:23.333 --> 14:28.000
I have been many women in my
time,
some rich, some poor.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.291
Rich, I find is preferable.

14:37.875 --> 14:40.458
Your father was an Austrian
Count.

14:42.083 --> 14:45.958
Not handsome,
but his money made up for that.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.166
We led a life of luxury.

14:48.166 --> 14:52.583
That is, until I gave birth
to a mutant son!

14:53.125 --> 14:56.750
The neighbors were not pleased.

15:04.875 --> 15:07.583
And that is when you abandoned
me.

15:10.333 --> 15:13.416
My shameful secret had been
revealed.

15:13.416 --> 15:18.583
The would-be countess
was a mutant!
I had to start over.

15:18.583 --> 15:21.083
You were inconvenient.

15:21.083 --> 15:24.416
I suppose you hate me for that.

15:24.416 --> 15:27.708
No, but I am sad for you.

15:27.708 --> 15:33.333
Sad? You want to talk about
sad? I am a shape-shifter.

15:33.333 --> 15:37.833
An outcast, even among mutants,
trusted by no one.

15:37.833 --> 15:40.083
I don't have a life of my own.

15:40.083 --> 15:43.500
I just steal little bits
from other people's lives.

15:44.583 --> 15:49.875
But that's how I survive!
So there's your truth, son!

15:49.875 --> 15:52.000
I didn't want you!

15:53.250 --> 15:55.750
Still sad for me?

15:57.416 --> 16:00.583
I will beg God
to bestow his grace on me,

16:00.583 --> 16:03.000
so that I may learn to forgive
you.

16:04.291 --> 16:08.125
Then I will ask him
to bestow his grace on you,

16:08.125 --> 16:10.750
so that you might forgive
yourself.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.958
See if you all can get their
attention!

16:25.708 --> 16:28.875
That's it, boys!
Keep your eye on the birdie!

16:40.291 --> 16:43.750
Cease fire, you fools! Cease
fire!

16:47.375 --> 16:49.375
Nice shooting, deadeye!

16:56.166 --> 17:00.583
Very clever, sis,
but you can't be in two places
at once!

17:02.458 --> 17:05.458
I almost got you killed
to save my own skin.

17:05.458 --> 17:09.458
Why should you, or your God,
care about me?

17:09.458 --> 17:14.208
As for God, he cares
for all of us, and wants us
to be healed.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.416
As for me, you are my mother.

17:18.375 --> 17:21.500
I cannot change
the pain you have caused me,

17:21.500 --> 17:23.458
so I will pray for you.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.208
I don't deserve your...

17:38.458 --> 17:41.125
prayers.

17:47.416 --> 17:48.833
Mother!

17:50.000 --> 17:51.875
You're next, demon!

17:56.375 --> 17:58.166
God help you, brother.

18:02.583 --> 18:03.958
No!

18:10.291 --> 18:12.708
Mother! Where are you?

18:15.291 --> 18:18.416
I shall... I shall save you!

18:19.958 --> 18:22.458
This ain't no time
to play Good Samaritan.

18:24.458 --> 18:28.500
You ain't saving nobody
tonight, preacher.
We're getting you home.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.416
Now they arrest those guys.

18:40.416 --> 18:44.250
Not for attacking mutants,
but for blowing up a dam.

18:45.875 --> 18:49.500
What about Mystique?
You find anything?

18:49.500 --> 18:53.208
Nope. Nothing left
but a bunch of questions.

18:53.875 --> 18:58.000
Why did she sacrifice herself
for me?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.583
I don't know.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.708
You shouldn't be
so hard on yourself, preacher.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.875
This faith of yours
has an effect on folks.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.375
Maybe you got through to her.

19:07.375 --> 19:10.208
Ah. God only knows.

19:10.208 --> 19:13.000
-What happened to Creed?
-What didn't?

19:18.583 --> 19:22.083
Mr. Creed,
back among the living?

19:22.083 --> 19:26.500
Listen to me. I admit, I wasn't
completely successful, but...

19:26.500 --> 19:28.583
Your plan failed miserably!

19:28.583 --> 19:32.125
Full of sloppy mistakes
and a curious omission,

19:32.125 --> 19:33.958
which we shall now remedy.

19:34.458 --> 19:37.583
-No!
-But we are not without mercy.

19:37.583 --> 19:40.333
We shall let you sort it out,

19:40.333 --> 19:43.708
starting with the part
you weren't willing
to clean up!

19:43.708 --> 19:46.458
No!

19:50.083 --> 19:51.458
Not that!

19:54.833 --> 19:58.250
-Well, well...
-Sabretooth!

19:59.208 --> 20:04.416
If it ain't my son,
the famous slayer of mutants!

20:04.416 --> 20:07.583
You don't understand! No!

20:07.583 --> 20:11.250
-What do you say, boy?
-No!

20:11.250 --> 20:15.583
-Come to papa!
-No!

20:22.250 --> 20:24.208
