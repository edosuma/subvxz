AKU: Long ago,
in a distant land,

00:04.923 --> 00:09.177
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.260 --> 00:12.931
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.014 --> 00:18.645
But a foolish Samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.728 --> 00:21.356
stepped forth to oppose me.

was struck,

00:26.819 --> 00:29.489
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.572 --> 00:33.993
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.077 --> 00:37.956
Now the fool seeks to return
to the past

00:38.039 --> 00:43.169
and undo the future that is Aku.
