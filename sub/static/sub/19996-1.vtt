02:24.721 --> 02:26.401
- Hi, Mr...
- Zabek.

02:26.481 --> 02:27.881
- Zabek.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:27.961 --> 02:30.201
- Find it all right?
- Yes, I'm so sorry. I was...

02:30.281 --> 02:32.521
No, don't worry.
Traffic's murder around here.

02:32.601 --> 02:34.481
- Find somewhere to park?
- Yes, I did.

02:34.561 --> 02:36.001
Well, take a look around.

02:36.081 --> 02:38.601
- Yeah, it's erm...
- It's quite a place, innit?

02:38.681 --> 02:41.441
- Look at these two, eh?
- Yes.

02:41.521 --> 02:43.561
Oh, my... Are they real?

02:43.641 --> 02:46.041
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'll say, yeah.

02:46.121 --> 02:47.721
They're Indonesian.

02:48.441 --> 02:50.721
Oh!

02:50.801 --> 02:52.481
- Oh!
- See, they're a couple.

02:52.561 --> 02:54.521
They're a pair.

02:54.601 --> 02:56.241
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, yeah.

02:56.321 --> 02:58.121
They come together.

02:59.201 --> 03:00.841
If you know what I mean.

03:00.921 --> 03:02.121
Yes.

03:02.201 --> 03:05.001
The big ones have been known
to eat sheep.

03:05.081 --> 03:07.401
And they have eaten...

03:07.481 --> 03:09.041
kids.

03:10.081 --> 03:12.521
How do they get them
in their mouths?

03:12.601 --> 03:15.241
Well, you know, they just
open their mouth and...

03:15.961 --> 03:17.921
Ugh!

03:19.081 --> 03:21.081
Like lightning.

03:21.161 --> 03:23.401
I just erm...

03:24.881 --> 03:27.841
I have to admit,
I'm really nervous.

03:28.681 --> 03:30.161
Why are you doing it, then?

03:31.281 --> 03:33.401
Oh, it's not for me.
It's for my kid.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.601
Oh... OK.

03:35.681 --> 03:37.801
Obsessed, is he?

03:37.881 --> 03:39.041
Yes.

03:39.121 --> 03:42.641
Yeah. Yeah. They're like that,
aren't they, the little boys?

03:42.721 --> 03:44.241
They get obsessed with things.

03:44.321 --> 03:46.681
They're obsessed with spiders
and then lizards...

03:46.761 --> 03:49.281
- Guns.
- Guns, yeah. All that.

03:49.361 --> 03:51.641
Here, look at this.
What can you see in there?

03:53.881 --> 03:56.801
That... is my big fat snake.

03:57.801 --> 03:59.761
Oh, yes.

03:59.841 --> 04:01.841
Looks quite slimy,
doesn't it?

04:03.081 --> 04:05.041
But it's not.

04:05.121 --> 04:06.761
It's very smooth.

04:07.921 --> 04:09.761
Do you want to touch it?

04:09.841 --> 04:11.081
No.

04:12.281 --> 04:14.001
OK.

04:15.001 --> 04:16.721
Right.

04:16.801 --> 04:18.601
Say hello...

04:19.801 --> 04:23.401
...to my little, fat,
furry friend, Penelope.

04:23.481 --> 04:25.801
Well, you see, my son's eight.

04:25.881 --> 04:30.681
And... I think, really, he'd
like something very special.

04:30.761 --> 04:31.881
Mm.

04:34.681 --> 04:36.801
Well, I could show you
my private collection.

04:36.881 --> 04:38.361
If you like.

04:40.001 --> 04:41.681
- Yes?
- Yes, please.

04:41.761 --> 04:43.121
Yes?

04:44.241 --> 04:45.641
OK.

04:46.641 --> 04:47.921
Come on.

04:48.001 --> 04:49.241
Oop.

04:49.321 --> 04:51.361
Ha-ha! Watch the maggots.

04:51.441 --> 04:55.441
Eurgh. Horrible.
Horrible little things.

05:00.841 --> 05:01.921
Hm?

05:03.441 --> 05:05.121
What do you think?

05:13.601 --> 05:15.961
I... I don't know
what I'm looking for.

05:16.681 --> 05:18.481
She's pregnant.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.561
- Just like me.
- Like you.

05:21.641 --> 05:23.801
Beautiful. Eh?

05:23.881 --> 05:26.321
Now, I can't let you hold her,
but...

05:27.161 --> 05:29.161
...there's one down here...

05:29.241 --> 05:32.201
which you will be holding.

05:32.281 --> 05:35.881
Where are you,
you little bitch?

05:35.961 --> 05:37.321
Come here.

05:37.401 --> 05:39.201
Come and say hello.

05:39.281 --> 05:42.361
- Come on.
- Is she dangerous?

05:45.041 --> 05:46.281
Yes.

05:47.841 --> 05:49.841
Come on.

05:50.921 --> 05:52.321
Where are you?

05:52.401 --> 05:55.361
Come back over here.

05:55.441 --> 05:56.921
Get on with it.

09:12.121 --> 09:14.001
<i>Listen, Mummy.</i>

09:14.801 --> 09:17.481
<i>That's how I was made.</i>

09:17.561 --> 09:20.961
<i>You can forget about that
ever happening again.</i>

09:21.041 --> 09:23.001
<i>Selfish bastards.</i>

09:23.081 --> 09:25.321
<i>No consideration.</i>

09:25.401 --> 09:27.401
<i>We may as well not exist.</i>

09:28.241 --> 09:32.841
<i>But shh. It's OK. I'm here.</i>

09:49.641 --> 09:51.641
I have mascara days like that.

09:52.681 --> 09:54.201
Very smudged.

10:18.041 --> 10:20.321
This is not gonna hurt
one little bit.

10:20.401 --> 10:22.721
- They said that last time.
- Did they?

10:22.801 --> 10:24.761
It did hurt
and I had a massive bruise.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.441
It was, like,
here to about there.

10:26.521 --> 10:28.601
- Oh, poor you.
- Mm.

10:28.681 --> 10:30.761
That's not very good, is it?

10:31.681 --> 10:33.681
Probably not in control
of their apparatus

10:33.761 --> 10:35.321
like nurse Jennifer.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.321
Lovely.

10:37.401 --> 10:40.761
So, I managed to track down
your records.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.681
You're not very easy
to track down.

10:42.761 --> 10:45.121
I felt a little bit
like Sherlock,

10:45.201 --> 10:47.641
with you as like
the disappearing woman.

10:47.721 --> 10:51.641
Lady Lucan, I think
we'll call you from now on.

10:51.721 --> 10:53.961
Yeah, can you
just call me Ruth?

10:55.121 --> 10:56.841
Yes, of course.

10:56.921 --> 10:59.401
Ruth. So...

11:00.361 --> 11:03.961
Did you know that if you hear
a really high-pitched sound

11:04.041 --> 11:05.481
later on in pregnancy,

11:05.561 --> 11:08.521
you can just start spurting
milk from your boobs?

11:08.601 --> 11:11.281
Like two rockets.
It's like boom, boom, pow!

11:11.361 --> 11:13.361
It's quite magical.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.281
Why are you telling me that?

11:16.361 --> 11:19.921
Just so that you know
you have absolutely no control

11:20.001 --> 11:22.521
over your mind
or your body any more.

11:22.601 --> 11:24.761
This one does.

11:24.841 --> 11:27.481
She's got all the control now.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.401
She'll be coming.

11:29.481 --> 11:34.481
OK, so I didn't have much time
with the notes.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.801
Phyllis gave them to me
this morning.

11:36.881 --> 11:39.841
What does your partner do,
Ruth?

11:48.921 --> 11:50.161
Oh.

11:52.801 --> 11:54.081
Oh.

11:55.841 --> 11:57.521
I'm very sorry.

11:57.601 --> 11:59.961
I didn't know.
I wasn't aware.

12:00.961 --> 12:02.401
Well, how would you know

12:02.481 --> 12:05.161
cos you don't actually
know me, do you?

12:05.241 --> 12:06.841
No.

12:09.281 --> 12:13.601
It's very important to let
the past stay in the past.

12:13.681 --> 12:15.641
It's just nature's way.

12:16.681 --> 12:19.401
I think nature's a bit of
a cunt, though, don't you?

12:19.481 --> 12:22.201
Negativity's not good
for the baby's spirit, really.

12:22.281 --> 12:24.721
- Do you think?
- Yes.

12:24.801 --> 12:27.801
I think it's good to try
to stay positive.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.841
And at the end of the day,

12:29.921 --> 12:33.401
you've got this force of
nature now inside you.

12:33.481 --> 12:35.561
Baby knows what to do.

12:36.401 --> 12:39.121
Baby will tell you what to do.

12:46.041 --> 12:48.041
I think she already does.

14:37.721 --> 14:39.161
Erm, it's just here.

14:39.241 --> 14:41.521
Vehicle

Scream if you want to
go faster.

16:11.321 --> 16:14.201

16:22.001 --> 16:23.321
- YOLO.
- What's that mean?

16:23.401 --> 16:25.161
You only live once.

16:25.241 --> 16:27.721

- Really?
- Yeah. It's a motto of mine.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.761
- So I'll drink to that.
- YOLO.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.201

- Yeah.

16:40.561 --> 16:42.281
You're a bit forward,
ain't you?

16:43.001 --> 16:44.361
Some might say.

16:44.441 --> 16:47.041
All right, I'm gonna just
lay my cards on the table here

16:47.121 --> 16:49.721
cos I don't want to lead you
up the garden path.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.121
But... I'm not after
a relationship.

16:52.201 --> 16:54.081
I'm not after
any sort of girlfriend.

16:54.161 --> 16:56.321
I don't want any baggage
to carry round with me.

16:56.401 --> 16:59.121
I'm sort of a bit too young
for all that sort of stuff.

16:59.201 --> 17:01.201
You know?
I'm still playing the game.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.401
I'm still, you know,
a weekend warrior.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.401
If you're after something
more serious

17:05.481 --> 17:07.361
because your
body clock's clicking on,

17:07.441 --> 17:10.361
then it ain't me,
I don't want any part of that.

17:10.441 --> 17:12.320
- You couldn't be more wrong.
- Really?

17:12.401 --> 17:13.641
We're the same.

17:13.721 --> 17:15.281
You don't know
anything about me.

17:15.361 --> 17:17.121
I know enough.
I've been watching you.

17:17.201 --> 17:18.681
- Oh, have you?
- Yeah.

17:18.761 --> 17:20.721
- What do you see?
- I like what I see.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.481
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

17:23.761 --> 17:27.401
John, can I get another?
Tell you what, let's get four.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.881
Couple of shots there, girls?

17:29.961 --> 17:32.681
I want to get them girls
a drink as well, you know.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.121
Just sort of...

17:34.201 --> 17:36.401
Just so I'm not putting
all my eggs in one basket.

17:36.481 --> 17:38.281
Girls, come on.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.361
That's it. Lovely.
Look at that.

17:41.401 --> 17:42.921
One, two, three,
here we go...

17:44.121 --> 17:46.001
That was nice, wasn't it?

17:46.081 --> 17:48.721
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

17:49.481 --> 17:51.601
Fucking hell.

17:52.721 --> 17:54.401
What's wrong with them?

17:54.481 --> 17:57.081
They're both pretty. I mean,
prettiest girls in here.

17:57.161 --> 17:58.961
But neither of them
want to, you know...

17:59.041 --> 18:01.441
They've just got, like,
no banter, have they?

18:01.521 --> 18:03.561
They don't know what
they're missing out on.

18:03.641 --> 18:05.921
Yeah, I mean, I was
thinking that in my own head.

18:06.001 --> 18:07.841
Yeah, I mean,
I love your music.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.441
Do you?
You like '70s music, then?

18:09.521 --> 18:10.841
I love '70s, '80s...

18:10.921 --> 18:13.121
Do you? It's my favourite too.

18:13.201 --> 18:15.041
'70s is where my heart is,
you know.

18:15.121 --> 18:17.361
Do you know what I
really admire about you?

18:17.441 --> 18:19.041
Go on.

18:19.121 --> 18:21.081
You know your onions.

18:23.921 --> 18:26.761
Well, that's a really nice
thing for you to say.

18:26.841 --> 18:29.841
I thought you were going to
say something about my clothes

18:29.921 --> 18:31.641
or my face or something.

18:31.721 --> 18:34.361
You look a bit familiar.
You from around here?

18:34.441 --> 18:36.081
- No, no.
- Met you before?

18:36.161 --> 18:37.841
Don't think so.
I'd have remembered.

18:37.921 --> 18:40.481
- Shall we get another drink?
- Yeah. No, that's good.

18:40.561 --> 18:42.281
- Get her a erm...
- Red wine.

18:42.361 --> 18:44.481
- Really?
- I'm on the dark side.

18:44.561 --> 18:46.721

20:35.401 --> 20:37.561
You've got a little bit more
about you.

20:37.641 --> 20:40.441
You know, fucking, you're
a little bit more open-minded.

20:40.521 --> 20:43.161
You don't mind what people
do to you, do you?

20:52.641 --> 20:54.241

I don't know why that made me
feel all...

21:17.441 --> 21:19.881
...sort of weird.
It turned me on, being sick.

21:20.921 --> 21:24.321
It's probably the gag reflex
or something like that.

21:44.041 --> 21:47.321
Here we go. I thought I had
a beer in here, but...

21:52.921 --> 21:55.441
Do you think every human
has needs, Dan?

21:55.521 --> 21:57.561
We haven't got any beers.
I thought I'd been out

21:57.641 --> 22:00.121
and got some, but I must have
drunk 'em before.

22:00.201 --> 22:02.281
There's half an egg sandwich
if you want it.

22:02.361 --> 22:05.201
Do you think every individual
needs food...

22:06.201 --> 22:08.121
...sex... love?

22:08.201 --> 22:10.601
Of course. If you don't have
all those things,

22:10.681 --> 22:12.401
you're gonna die, ain't you?

22:12.481 --> 22:14.561
Would you die without love,
Dan?

22:15.361 --> 22:17.721
I'm too young to die.

22:18.521 --> 22:20.401
Have you got anyone
who loves you?

22:20.481 --> 22:23.001
Yes, of course I have. I've
got my mother. She loves me.

22:24.281 --> 22:26.601
- Does she?
- Yes, of course she does.

22:27.801 --> 22:30.241
Mums love sons. That's
how the world works, innit?

22:30.321 --> 22:32.281
Parents love their kids.
Didn't you know?

22:32.361 --> 22:35.441
It's not rocket science. This
is all getting very serious.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.441
Can you not put a downer
on the evening?

22:37.521 --> 22:39.561
I was really looking forward
to getting back

22:39.641 --> 22:41.641
and having some fun.

22:41.721 --> 22:44.081
I tell you what, I'll put on
a bit of music for us.

22:46.641 --> 22:48.361
What sort of stuff
do you like?

22:48.441 --> 22:50.881
Dirty Dancing?
Do you know that one?

22:50.961 --> 22:52.921
Course I do.
I'm not retarded.

22:55.281 --> 22:57.001
What about Grease?
I like Grease.

22:57.081 --> 22:58.681
That always puts me
in a good mood.

22:58.761 --> 23:01.401
- A bit of Summer Loving.
- It's not summer, is it?

23:01.481 --> 23:03.161
And you're not
Olivia Newton-John.

23:03.241 --> 23:05.281
You look more like Elton John.

23:05.361 --> 23:06.761
Glass houses.

24:50.361 --> 24:53.081
No, I'm not! How am I selfish?

24:53.161 --> 24:55.881
We said we wanted the same
thing when we was back there.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.601

24:57.681 --> 24:59.521
Oh, fuck! This is all I need.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.681
Come on.

25:09.761 --> 25:11.521
Come on, you.
Let's just get you to bed.

25:11.601 --> 25:13.641
- I've got to do the washing.
- No, you haven't.

25:13.721 --> 25:16.361
Last thing you need to do at
this time of night is washing.

25:16.441 --> 25:18.121
That's why
I've got no clothes.

25:18.201 --> 25:20.681
You've washed them all
to buggery, ain't you? Eh?

25:20.761 --> 25:22.241
Get into bed.

25:22.321 --> 25:25.561
Finish your chores tomorrow.
This place is a shit tip.

25:25.641 --> 25:28.081

25:39.241 --> 25:41.801
I tell you what. I can't wait
to see you naked.

25:41.881 --> 25:44.481
Cramps your style a bit,
doesn't she?

25:44.561 --> 25:47.321
No, she just lives here.
We get on, you know?

25:47.401 --> 25:50.601
Oh, yeah.
You smell like a stripper.

25:50.681 --> 25:53.961
I fucking love that smell.
Fucking slutty and dirty.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.641
You're filth, aren't you?

25:55.721 --> 25:58.361
Do you always talk to her
like that?

25:58.441 --> 26:01.681
Yeah, the sad thing is, you
know, I'm an only child,

26:01.761 --> 26:04.161
so I get everything
when she's gone -

26:04.241 --> 26:06.041
and that won't be too long.

26:06.121 --> 26:08.641
She's losing her memory.
Everything's going, you know?

26:08.721 --> 26:10.241
I'm gonna come at you
like a dog.

26:10.321 --> 26:12.201
- Do it.
- You're bad, ain't you?

26:12.281 --> 26:13.681
You're a real bad girl.

26:13.761 --> 26:15.081
Oh!

26:16.441 --> 26:18.281
Something moved down there.

26:18.361 --> 26:20.401
That's not right.

26:20.481 --> 26:22.561
Are you fucking pregnant?

26:23.561 --> 26:25.361
Fuck!

26:25.721 --> 26:26.881
Fuck!

26:26.961 --> 26:29.601

What you fucking doing?

26:54.121 --> 26:55.561
I'm gonna lay down.

26:57.361 --> 26:59.081
It's messy, isn't it?

26:59.161 --> 27:00.641
Relationships...

27:01.481 --> 27:03.521
...kids and responsibilities?

27:04.801 --> 27:08.161
What would you know, though?
You avoid all that, don't you?

27:14.041 --> 27:16.441
Need a bit of bleach on there.

27:18.121 --> 27:19.601

27:31.881 --> 27:33.841
Don't worry.
I'll put the washing on.

32:11.041 --> 32:13.041
Not directly.

32:13.121 --> 32:16.441
But it's a tricky decision
for a company.

32:16.521 --> 32:18.241
I understand.

32:18.321 --> 32:20.041
You'd be taking
your maternity leave

32:20.121 --> 32:22.961
as soon as you've unpacked
your stapler.

32:23.041 --> 32:25.561

- It's a cut-throat world.

33:11.321 --> 33:12.601
Yeah.

33:12.681 --> 33:15.081
I've actually had
to make cuts already,

33:15.161 --> 33:17.521
very, very harsh cuts and...

33:18.681 --> 33:20.921
It's been awful.

33:21.001 --> 33:22.681
Really awful.

33:23.921 --> 33:27.761
<i>I told you, she's
a merciless, frigid bitch.</i>

33:29.001 --> 33:33.401
Anyway... sorry,
but I've got to get on.

33:33.481 --> 33:37.601
Do you always work late...
alone?

33:39.281 --> 33:40.681
Yes.

33:40.761 --> 33:42.521
Well, I've got my priorities.

33:42.601 --> 33:44.801
Don't you do anything else?

33:44.881 --> 33:47.201
Well... of course.

33:50.401 --> 33:52.361
Well, I've...

33:54.441 --> 33:56.521
I've got a dog.

33:57.241 --> 33:59.201
I walk him.

34:01.921 --> 34:04.281
Do my food shop.
I've got to eat.

34:06.121 --> 34:09.400
I... I go on
an odd activity weekend.

34:09.481 --> 34:12.281
I don't take them seriously
or anything, but..

34:12.360 --> 34:13.841
Why would you?

34:14.481 --> 34:17.081
- I'm so busy.
- You must be.

34:17.161 --> 34:18.841
I let my friend convince me

34:18.920 --> 34:20.960
to go on one of those
skydiving things.

34:21.041 --> 34:23.360
I mean, can you believe it?
Who does that?

34:23.440 --> 34:26.161
I mean, it's crazy,
but I did it! I did it!

34:26.241 --> 34:28.561
- Skydiving!
- Yeah!

34:28.641 --> 34:30.521
- Oh, right.
- It was mental.

34:30.601 --> 34:33.561
Who pays someone to throw them
out of an aeroplane?

34:33.641 --> 34:36.281
It's not a substitute
for a personality, is it?

34:37.880 --> 34:41.201
<i>Sad, lonely woman.</i>

34:42.001 --> 34:44.161
<i>Be ruthless, Ruth.</i>

34:44.241 --> 34:46.721
Anyway, I'm sorry
I wasted your time.

34:47.761 --> 34:49.761
Word of advice.

34:49.841 --> 34:52.601
Get it out of your system,
the motherhood thing.

34:52.681 --> 34:54.601
You know?
Sort out your own business

34:54.681 --> 34:57.441
before you interfere
in other people's.

34:59.761 --> 35:01.241
Oh, I will.

35:45.521 --> 35:48.761
I'm sorry, Ella. I've had to
make some really harsh cuts.

35:50.281 --> 35:52.561
It's a cutthroat world,
you know?

35:54.921 --> 35:56.921
You know, you should er...

35:59.041 --> 36:01.161
You should get out more
and have more fun.

36:01.241 --> 36:02.681
I really believe that.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.401
Cos, activity weekends,

36:04.481 --> 36:06.841
you're never gonna get
a shag on those.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.401
Might see if I can...

36:14.321 --> 36:15.521
Whee.

36:16.801 --> 36:18.281
Whee.

36:19.321 --> 36:21.121
It's a nice chair, actually.

36:22.121 --> 36:24.121
Where can I get one of these?

36:32.521 --> 36:36.801
<i>That... was perfect.</i>

36:51.721 --> 36:53.601
<i>Don't get too cocky.</i>

36:53.681 --> 36:56.521
<i>You'll stand out
from the crowd.</i>

36:56.601 --> 36:58.401
<i>Remember who's the mastermind.</i>

37:00.041 --> 37:02.761
<i>You wouldn't have done it
without me,</i>

37:02.841 --> 37:04.761
<i>would you?</i>

37:05.761 --> 37:07.201
<i>Would you?</i>

37:07.281 --> 37:08.721
<i>It was a...</i>

37:08.801 --> 37:11.121
<i>a group decision.</i>

37:11.201 --> 37:13.881
<i>Erm... it was a matter
of life or death.</i>

37:13.961 --> 37:17.001
<i>It's a tragic... incident</i>

37:17.081 --> 37:19.641
<i>and, you know, people are
aware of the dangers,</i>

37:19.721 --> 37:21.561
<i>but just...</i>

37:21.641 --> 37:23.721
<i>We were unlucky today.
We were very unlucky.</i>

37:23.801 --> 37:25.161
<i>In these situations,</i>

37:25.241 --> 37:26.961
<i>there's nothing you can do,
really.</i>

37:27.041 --> 37:28.641
Nothing you can do.

37:31.121 --> 37:32.841
Dead eyes.

37:34.561 --> 37:36.561
Dead eyes.

37:57.241 --> 37:58.801
Tom, isn't it?

37:58.881 --> 38:00.161
- Yeah.
- Hi!

38:00.241 --> 38:02.481
- Hi!
- We spoke on the phone.

38:02.561 --> 38:04.401
Ah, yes. Yes. How are you?

38:04.481 --> 38:06.721
- I'm good. How are you?
- Well.

38:07.481 --> 38:09.521
Yeah, I'm just here
for the induction, so...

38:09.601 --> 38:13.001
What sort of level
were you interested in?

38:13.081 --> 38:14.921
Erm, well, I'm a beginner,

38:15.001 --> 38:17.121
but I feel quite confident,
actually.

38:17.201 --> 38:20.321
I feel like I'd like
to go quite advanced.

38:20.401 --> 38:22.361
Absolutely, absolutely.
Your first time.

38:22.441 --> 38:23.561
Yeah.

38:23.641 --> 38:25.601
So you don't know how to use
this equipment?

38:25.681 --> 38:28.161
You know, I'm kind of...
I've been reading up about it.

38:28.241 --> 38:31.601
So... I mean, this is, like...

38:32.401 --> 38:34.441
This is a kind of
safety rope, isn't it?

38:34.521 --> 38:36.241
It's a rope.

38:37.641 --> 38:39.201
I kind of think
you wouldn't put

38:39.281 --> 38:41.161
more than seven people
on this.

38:45.721 --> 38:48.161
What are you getting at?
Are you here for a lesson?

38:48.241 --> 38:51.081
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Of course. Yeah.

38:51.161 --> 38:54.001
The thing is
that I couldn't teach you

38:54.081 --> 38:57.401
because of your...
your current condition.

38:57.481 --> 38:59.561
All right, look,
don't worry about that.

38:59.641 --> 39:03.241
Because the thing is
I am really fit.

39:03.321 --> 39:05.921
I have been up to all sorts.

39:06.001 --> 39:08.721
You would not believe
what I've been doing recently.

39:08.801 --> 39:11.001
Sure, but if something
were to go wrong,

39:11.761 --> 39:14.521
then I'd be to blame.
You know?

39:16.041 --> 39:17.801
You'd be to blame,
wouldn't you?

39:17.881 --> 39:19.601
Yeah.

39:19.681 --> 39:23.001
Have you been to blame
many times before?

39:26.721 --> 39:27.881
Uh...

39:28.761 --> 39:30.921
Sorry, my 8pm is here.

39:31.001 --> 39:33.481
Um, sorry I couldn't
teach you.

39:33.561 --> 39:35.481
It's all right.

39:36.401 --> 39:38.761
Didn't have a problem earlier,
did you?

39:38.841 --> 39:40.161
I didn't s... I'm sorry.

39:40.241 --> 39:43.321
You knew I was pregnant.
You were still gonna teach me.

39:44.561 --> 39:46.121
It's very slippery.

40:17.241 --> 40:18.761
No.

40:19.841 --> 40:23.001
I will. I'll do it. I promise.

40:31.681 --> 40:33.321
I'm trying!

40:34.641 --> 40:36.481
You fucking do it!

40:55.801 --> 40:58.001
Just bring you up
a little bit today, Ruth.

40:58.081 --> 41:00.881
So I can have a feel around,

41:00.961 --> 41:02.841
see how the baby is.

41:02.921 --> 41:04.841
Oop, there we go.
Sorry, that's...

41:05.521 --> 41:07.201
- That a bit better?
- That's better.

41:07.281 --> 41:09.801
Bit far down now.
I'll pop you back up again.

41:09.881 --> 41:14.721
All these new technical things
do bother me. How's that?

41:14.801 --> 41:16.201
- Yeah, that's good.
- Lovely.

41:16.281 --> 41:19.961
All right, so I'm just gonna
lift your top up.

41:20.041 --> 41:22.881
There's a...
I have to do this.

41:22.961 --> 41:25.721
Get my hands warmed up.
My mum taught me this.

41:25.801 --> 41:27.681
Don't learn that at college.

41:27.761 --> 41:29.121
OK.

41:29.201 --> 41:32.081
I'm just gonna press here,
down the side.

41:32.161 --> 41:34.481
There you go.
Ooh, there you go.

41:34.561 --> 41:36.601
She doesn't like that.

41:38.041 --> 41:39.721
I'm just feeling for the head.

41:39.801 --> 41:41.561
Well, it's in this area.

41:41.641 --> 41:43.921
It's in the stomach area.
Even I know that.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.161
Yeah.

41:45.241 --> 41:46.681
Don't worry, she's got a head.

41:46.761 --> 41:49.241
She's thinking all the time,
a bit too much.

41:49.321 --> 41:52.481
We discussed blood pressure,
didn't we, last time?

41:52.561 --> 41:54.281
To monitor
your blood pressure.

41:54.361 --> 41:56.121
So are you
looking after yourself?

41:56.201 --> 41:57.961
Eating well?
How are you sleeping?

41:58.041 --> 42:00.601
Well, she's not really
letting me sleep, so...

42:01.601 --> 42:03.281
- No?
- No.

42:03.361 --> 42:06.201
And that's affecting
your... mind...

42:07.201 --> 42:09.801
...your rationality...

42:09.881 --> 42:12.601
Just have to make a few notes,
you see.

42:12.681 --> 42:14.721
I have to monitor this.
It's my job

42:14.801 --> 42:18.521
- to keep track of everything.
- What do you mean?

42:18.601 --> 42:20.401
Well, if there's anything
untoward,

42:20.481 --> 42:22.161
or anything
difficult occurring,

42:22.241 --> 42:24.321
I need to get in touch
with social services.

42:24.401 --> 42:26.081
No.

42:26.161 --> 42:28.401
I don't want you to report it
to social services.

42:28.481 --> 42:29.801
Well...

42:29.881 --> 42:31.961
Why would you report it
to social services?

42:32.041 --> 42:34.321
Only if something's
bothering you, but we need...

42:34.401 --> 42:36.001
No. No, no, no.

42:36.081 --> 42:38.361
I don't want you to be
contacting social services.

42:38.441 --> 42:39.881
At all.

42:39.961 --> 42:41.841
It's not personal.
We do it with everybody.

42:41.921 --> 42:43.761
It's so that we can see
you're all right...

42:43.841 --> 42:46.361
No, no, no. They interfere
and mess around.

42:46.441 --> 42:47.961
What are we
talking about here?

42:48.041 --> 42:49.561
We talking about...?

42:49.641 --> 42:51.801
We're talking about adoption,
aren't we?

42:51.881 --> 42:53.561
- Not at all.
- We are.

42:53.641 --> 42:56.001
If you tell social services
about me,

42:56.081 --> 42:58.521
- we're talking of adoption.
- You're all right.

42:58.601 --> 43:01.241
And I know what they do.
What they do

43:01.321 --> 43:03.601
is they give your baby -
they steal it from you -

43:03.681 --> 43:05.681
and give it to some fucking
child-hungry,

43:05.761 --> 43:07.041
middle-class couple

43:07.121 --> 43:09.161
and then I won't get to see
the baby again.

43:09.241 --> 43:12.281
It won't happen. This baby is
attached with a fucking cord.

43:12.361 --> 43:13.961
She wouldn't even
let it happen.

43:14.041 --> 43:17.281
That's not going to happen.
Ruth, you have to trust me.

43:17.361 --> 43:20.481
You have got to start thinking
about what's best.

43:20.561 --> 43:23.001
It's all about you
and your choices.

43:24.241 --> 43:26.561
Sit down.

43:26.641 --> 43:28.241
What do you mean?

43:28.321 --> 43:30.041
What I mean is

43:30.121 --> 43:33.921
nobody is going to take this
baby away from you...

43:34.001 --> 43:36.481
if you make the right choices.

43:37.641 --> 43:41.721
You have to decide
what is right

43:41.801 --> 43:43.641
and what's wrong.

43:50.641 --> 43:52.481
Send me a sign.

44:45.881 --> 44:49.721
<i>Loneliness, it's the worst.</i>

44:50.761 --> 44:53.201
<i>But, luckily,
you'll never be alone</i>

44:53.281 --> 44:55.521
<i>because you've got me.</i>

44:55.601 --> 44:57.521
<i>Isn't that great?</i>

44:59.561 --> 45:01.481
<i>I despise crowds.</i>

45:01.561 --> 45:03.241
<i>Look at this lot.</i>

45:03.321 --> 45:05.041
<i>Out on the rape.</i>

45:05.721 --> 45:09.641
<i>The next morning they'll
all be, "It wasn't me."</i>

45:09.721 --> 45:11.481
<i>Animals.</i>

45:11.561 --> 45:13.561
<i>A fucking zoo, this town.</i>

45:14.601 --> 45:19.561
<i>A kind soul
is as rare as a unicorn.</i>

45:22.641 --> 45:24.761
- Claire?
- Yeah. I'm Josh.

45:24.841 --> 45:26.601
Oh, hi.

45:26.681 --> 45:28.481
Not who you're expecting?

45:28.561 --> 45:32.161
- No, but that's fine, so...
- Come in, anyway.

45:32.241 --> 45:35.081
- This is lovely!
- Yeah, welcome.

45:35.161 --> 45:38.201
The spare room's upstairs.
There's extra rooms up there.

45:38.281 --> 45:39.881
Zac's room's up there.

45:39.961 --> 45:42.361
Zac's Buddha's in pride
of place for some reason.

45:42.441 --> 45:43.601
- Um...
- OK.

45:43.681 --> 45:46.241
I'm in the middle of cooking.
Mind if I stop it burning?

45:46.321 --> 45:49.081
Go for it. Is it OK if I just
put my stuff down?

45:49.161 --> 45:51.761
Yeah, yeah, of course,
make yourself at home.

46:00.001 --> 46:01.961
- Should be all right.
- Really lovely.

46:02.041 --> 46:04.121
Thank you.
Yeah, it's quite...

46:04.201 --> 46:06.681
It's all chilled out,
it's a nice spot.

46:08.481 --> 46:10.201
Yeah, Zac isn't here,
I'm afraid.

46:10.281 --> 46:12.801
- He's not here much.
- OK.

46:12.881 --> 46:14.881
Which means he never cleans,
but er...

46:14.961 --> 46:16.481
- That's a bit annoying.
- Oh, no.

46:16.561 --> 46:18.641
- It's never messy. I do it.
- OK.

46:18.721 --> 46:20.601
And, you know, he's...
he's lovely.

46:20.681 --> 46:22.801
Yeah. He's just
a bit away with the fairies.

46:22.881 --> 46:24.801
- Fickle.
- Kinda head-in-the-clouds.

46:24.881 --> 46:26.881
- Flawed.
- He's always got projects.

46:26.961 --> 46:28.761
- Bit of a pig.
- No, no, no.

46:28.841 --> 46:30.761
He's a lovely bloke
to live with, really.

46:30.841 --> 46:31.961
Oh, great.

46:32.041 --> 46:34.161
Yeah. I mean,
do you want to sit down?

46:34.241 --> 46:35.441
Erm, yeah.

46:36.561 --> 46:38.641
- Erm, yeah.
- Erm...

46:39.721 --> 46:42.361
Sorry, I don't mean to pry,
but what's, you know...

46:42.441 --> 46:44.001
OK, yeah, I...

46:45.001 --> 46:46.721
So, I was with someone...

46:46.801 --> 46:49.281
and we were, you know,
committed, and everything,

46:49.361 --> 46:51.081
and he said he was ready.

46:51.161 --> 46:53.921
And then about a third of
the way into the pregnancy

46:54.001 --> 46:55.801
he changed his mind.

46:55.881 --> 47:00.481
And he ran off
with a 23-year-old.

47:00.561 --> 47:03.481
- Shit.
- TV researcher with tattoos.

47:03.561 --> 47:06.321
And, you know,
it was his flat,

47:06.401 --> 47:09.841
so I had to...
I got chucked out, basically.

47:09.921 --> 47:12.121
- Yeah.
- That's horrendous.

47:12.201 --> 47:14.801
No, I mean, don't worry.
Don't worry about it.

47:14.881 --> 47:16.721
Honestly, people have been
really kind.

47:16.801 --> 47:19.721
Have they?
It doesn't sound very kind.

47:20.961 --> 47:24.281
I'm sorry, just people can be
so fucking selfish.

47:25.761 --> 47:28.161
- Yeah, they can.
- Sorry.

47:28.241 --> 47:30.321
Sorry. Makes me feel sick.

47:33.681 --> 47:35.441
Well, I... I like kids.

47:35.521 --> 47:37.241
So, you know...

47:38.841 --> 47:41.081
Yeah, I've got a little niece,
actually.

47:41.161 --> 47:43.161
I look after her all the time.

47:43.241 --> 47:45.041
- Here.
- Oh, that so sweet.

47:45.121 --> 47:48.241
I'm mad uncle Josh
and, yeah, I love it.

47:48.321 --> 47:50.281
- I love it, yeah.
- Aw.

47:50.361 --> 47:53.321
It's a bit different living
with one, though, isn't it?

47:53.401 --> 47:56.201
I mean, they just
take over your life, really.

47:56.281 --> 47:58.321
Then you have to kind of
hand yourself over

47:58.401 --> 48:01.641
like some kind of
human sacrifice to their will.

48:05.881 --> 48:08.521
Look,
I think Zac'll be back soon.

48:08.601 --> 48:10.321
Um...

48:10.401 --> 48:11.921
Do you wanna... I mean...

48:12.001 --> 48:14.441
Well, if I could just
carry on cooking,

48:14.521 --> 48:16.041
you could have some,
and stay.

48:16.121 --> 48:18.961
- Erm... I wouldn't wanna...
- Yeah, I'm bloody starving.

48:19.041 --> 48:20.681
...eat you out of
house and home.

48:20.761 --> 48:22.921
No, well, I mean,
you could eat Zac's portion,

48:23.001 --> 48:24.521
as far as I'm concerned.

48:24.601 --> 48:27.041
- That's fine.
- Yeah.

48:33.921 --> 48:35.961
I don't know about you,

48:36.041 --> 48:38.401
I just think if you put
an egg in something,

48:38.481 --> 48:40.241
it immediately tastes nicer.

48:40.321 --> 48:42.561
I wouldn't know
cos I don't really cook, so...

48:42.641 --> 48:44.041
Or an anchovy.

48:44.121 --> 48:47.481
An anchovy. I'm just thinking,
does Claire like anchovies?

48:47.561 --> 48:48.961
Right.

48:49.041 --> 48:51.521
You're speaking to yourself
in the third person.

48:51.601 --> 48:54.521
Is that what we would expect
from a prospective flatmate?

48:54.601 --> 48:56.761
No, no, no, I...

48:56.841 --> 48:59.601
Erm... OK, I've just never had
an anchovy, so...

48:59.681 --> 49:01.361
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah!

49:01.441 --> 49:03.161
No, I've never had one.

49:03.241 --> 49:04.881
Right, OK,
we need to change this.

49:04.961 --> 49:07.121
I don't like the look of them.
Don't get them out.

49:07.201 --> 49:08.841
Yeah, these are amazing.

49:08.921 --> 49:11.721
They look like the eyelids
of old men that have died.

49:11.801 --> 49:14.601
Tasty, though. Here you go,
here's a tiny smudge.

49:14.681 --> 49:16.361
No, no, no, you're not
gonna make me.

49:16.441 --> 49:19.561
- Try it. Try a smidge.
- Why is it hairy?

49:19.641 --> 49:23.521
It's just... These are...
These are luxury hairs.

49:23.601 --> 49:25.361
- This is good living.
- Oh, my God.

49:25.441 --> 49:27.281
Tastes amazing.
It's an acquired taste.

49:27.361 --> 49:29.321
We'll sophisticate you
if you live here.

49:29.401 --> 49:31.361
Ugh.

49:31.441 --> 49:33.721
No?

49:34.521 --> 49:36.241
- You've poisoned me.
- No.

49:36.321 --> 49:37.961
You've poisoned
my unborn child.

49:38.041 --> 49:40.761
No, no. These contain
omega three,

49:40.841 --> 49:43.841
I think you'll find -
iron, calcium probably,

49:43.921 --> 49:45.881
- vitamin D.
- Are you a doctor?

49:45.961 --> 49:51.081
I am Dr Anchovy, and this
is the only thing I prescribe.

49:51.921 --> 49:53.681
Yeah.

49:55.321 --> 49:58.721
Next week, I'll get you...
Are you all right?

49:58.801 --> 50:00.841
- Are you OK?
- I don't feel very well.

50:00.921 --> 50:02.841
Christ, I'm sorry.
Was it the anchovy?

50:02.921 --> 50:05.201
- Is it OK if I sit down?
- Yeah, yeah, lie down.

50:05.281 --> 50:07.281
Just put your feet up.

50:15.881 --> 50:17.441
Can I get you
a glass of water or...?

50:17.521 --> 50:21.161
I'm just really erm...
I'm just really tired.

50:21.881 --> 50:23.521
Of course you are.

50:23.601 --> 50:25.601
You've been through shitloads.

50:25.681 --> 50:28.081
On your own.
I mean, anyone would be tired.

50:30.841 --> 50:32.921
You're really kind,
aren't you?

50:34.281 --> 50:38.241
Do you want a...
a cushion or anything or...?

50:41.121 --> 50:42.361
Oh, my God.

50:42.441 --> 50:44.881
- Did you see that?
- Is that the baby moving?

50:44.961 --> 50:46.801
That's nuts.

50:48.321 --> 50:49.921
Give me your hand.

50:50.001 --> 50:52.001
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Yeah.

50:56.841 --> 50:59.641
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah, that's amazing.

50:59.721 --> 51:02.161
No-one else has felt her.

51:02.241 --> 51:03.841
Seriously?

51:03.921 --> 51:07.081
Well, I'm very privileged,
thank you very much.

51:07.161 --> 51:09.881
She's saying, "Hey, Mum,

51:09.961 --> 51:13.241
I learnt how to do
the boogaloo, self-taught."

51:13.321 --> 51:15.561
<i>No, I'm not.
I'm saying fuck off.</i>

51:15.641 --> 51:17.641
<i>Can't you see
he's just pretending?</i>

51:17.721 --> 51:20.521
I think she's actually
telling me to get on with it.

51:20.601 --> 51:22.761
Stay there, stay there,
don't do a thing.

51:34.081 --> 51:35.881
<i>He's coming.</i>

51:40.681 --> 51:43.041
<i>Do it. Do it now!</i>

51:50.921 --> 51:53.881
- Please! It wasn't me!
- Agh!

52:01.201 --> 52:02.561
Fuck.

52:04.321 --> 52:06.361
Argh!

52:08.441 --> 52:11.361
<i>That's it. Yes.</i>

52:17.361 --> 52:19.801
It was completely unnecessary
to kill that man.

52:19.881 --> 52:22.281
- He was really nice.
<i>- He was a sop.</i>

52:22.361 --> 52:24.441
<i>A hipster sop.</i>

52:24.521 --> 52:26.641
Shh.

52:26.721 --> 52:28.561
The sacrifices
I've had to make.

52:28.641 --> 52:29.801
<i>What sacrifices?</i>

52:29.881 --> 52:32.001
Children these days
are really spoiled.

52:32.081 --> 52:33.921
It's like, "Mummy,
I want a PlayStation.

52:34.001 --> 52:36.321
Mummy, I want you
to kill that man."

52:36.401 --> 52:37.841
<i>I don't want a new...</i>

52:37.921 --> 52:39.521
I know you don't want
a new daddy,

52:39.601 --> 52:41.241
but there's no possibility
of that,

52:41.321 --> 52:43.041
so stop going on about it.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.281
<i>He saw everything.</i>

52:46.361 --> 52:47.881
I know he's a witness,

52:47.961 --> 52:50.401
but there's a chance he might
not have told anyone.

52:50.481 --> 52:52.921
<i>- His name was Josh.</i>
- No, you're right.

52:53.001 --> 52:56.081
No-one called Josh is not
gonna tell the authorities.

52:56.801 --> 53:00.001
<i>He would have been like
all the rest. Inherently evil.</i>

53:00.081 --> 53:02.281
Look, stop going on about it.
I'm serious.

53:02.361 --> 53:03.481
<i>Pah!</i>

53:03.561 --> 53:05.561
I'm the mother.
I am in control.

53:05.641 --> 53:08.441
<i>You regret it.
You regret killing them.</i>

53:09.761 --> 53:11.681
I'm doing this
cos you're making me.

53:11.761 --> 53:13.601
<i>Oh, no.</i>

53:13.681 --> 53:15.921
<i>No. Please, no. No.</i>

53:16.001 --> 53:18.201
<i>I want you to let</i>

53:18.281 --> 53:20.881
<i>a feeling of wellbeing
wash over you.</i>

53:21.881 --> 53:24.481
<i>A feeling of love
for your fellow man.</i>

53:25.281 --> 53:30.081
<i>I want you to say to yourself,
"I am love.</i>

53:30.161 --> 53:32.321
<i>Everyone is kindness.</i>

53:32.401 --> 53:34.281
<i>Everyone loves me.</i>

53:34.961 --> 53:36.961
<i>Everyone loves my baby."</i>

53:38.081 --> 53:41.761
<i>And I want you to imagine
everyone you've ever met</i>

53:41.841 --> 53:44.241
<i>standing around you
in a circle</i>

53:44.321 --> 53:47.161
<i>and placing their hands
on your bump,</i>

53:48.161 --> 53:51.121
<i>placing their love
upon your baby.</i>

53:52.201 --> 53:54.601
<i>This is the world.</i>

53:54.681 --> 53:56.601
<i>And they are saying,</i>

53:56.681 --> 53:59.201
<i>"We are here
to protect you..."</i>

54:08.281 --> 54:10.401
<i>Listen to
the sound of my voice.</i>

54:13.481 --> 54:15.401
<i>You feel better now.</i>

54:16.841 --> 54:18.601
I feel a lot better now.

54:49.041 --> 54:51.081
Hey.

54:51.161 --> 54:53.961
Excuse me? Excuse me?

54:55.481 --> 54:57.001
Hello?

54:58.041 --> 54:59.721
Excuse me?

55:09.761 --> 55:11.921
Oh, fuck.

55:15.161 --> 55:16.641
<i>He knows.</i>

55:16.721 --> 55:18.401
He's onto us.

55:20.681 --> 55:23.041
Can't believe
that he's fucking onto us.

55:31.801 --> 55:35.001
<i>He hath slipped from the net
whom we chased.</i>

55:36.081 --> 55:40.521
<i>He hath escaped us
who should be our prey.</i>

55:40.601 --> 55:43.481
<i>O'ermastered by slumber
we sank,</i>

55:44.481 --> 55:46.881
<i>And our quarry
hath stolen away.</i>

55:57.321 --> 55:58.961
Zabek.

56:00.481 --> 56:02.761
He was creepy.

56:02.841 --> 56:04.961
- Creepy little man.
<i>- Slimy.</i>

56:05.761 --> 56:08.041
<i>Dumb. Like a lizard.</i>

56:08.921 --> 56:11.161
Dan.

56:11.241 --> 56:13.801
What... a dickhead.

56:15.041 --> 56:17.641
He was a pig. A total pig.

56:17.721 --> 56:20.441
<i>He just didn't have
the balls.</i>

56:21.961 --> 56:26.361
- Mm. Ella.
<i>- Poor leadership skills!</i>

56:26.441 --> 56:29.361
- Cold-hearted bitch.
<i>- I agree.</i>

56:29.441 --> 56:31.281
Done her.

56:31.361 --> 56:33.201
Very efficient with that one.

56:34.761 --> 56:37.041
Zac.

56:37.761 --> 56:39.201
I didn't speak to him much,

56:39.281 --> 56:42.001
but I could tell
he was a gobshite.

56:43.241 --> 56:44.841
Total little twat.

56:44.921 --> 56:46.761
But it was a shame about Josh.

56:48.081 --> 56:49.521
Len.

56:50.521 --> 56:52.761
<i>Len.</i>

56:52.841 --> 56:54.721
<i>Len.</i>

57:04.761 --> 57:06.081
- Hi!
- Hi.

57:06.161 --> 57:07.801
I was wondering
if I could talk to you

57:07.881 --> 57:09.561
about Child Charity.

57:09.641 --> 57:11.641
It's a local organisation
that is working

57:11.721 --> 57:13.321
for children
living in poverty.

57:13.401 --> 57:15.361
- I already give to charity...
- Do you?

57:15.441 --> 57:17.241
Which charities
do you give to?

57:17.321 --> 57:19.681
- I do sponsored runs.
- Oh, wow.

57:19.761 --> 57:21.361
You must be really fit.

57:21.441 --> 57:23.121
- Yeah.
- I'm terrible.

57:23.201 --> 57:25.441
- I'm just, like, "Oh..."
- OK.

57:26.441 --> 57:28.321
Yeah, so do you have
five minutes?

57:28.401 --> 57:30.361
Not really.

57:30.441 --> 57:32.401
- Can I come in?
- No.

57:32.481 --> 57:34.081
Do you have a toilet?

57:34.161 --> 57:36.241
You know I have a toilet.

57:36.921 --> 57:38.641
Can I use it?

57:42.001 --> 57:44.961
- It's upstairs.
- Thanks.

57:45.041 --> 57:47.521
Erm... Great. Oh.

57:47.601 --> 57:49.281
Just in case I fall over.

57:49.361 --> 57:50.801
Oh, this is nice.

57:50.881 --> 57:52.681
Sports equipment everywhere!

57:55.881 --> 57:59.161
Sorry about that. I've got
a bladder the size of a pea.

57:59.241 --> 58:02.321
I need to piss every 11 houses
or something like that.

58:04.001 --> 58:05.601
What are you doing?

58:05.681 --> 58:07.921
I thought we could discuss
your donations.

58:08.001 --> 58:09.601
I told you
I already give to charity.

58:09.681 --> 58:11.161
Not to Child Charity, though.

58:11.241 --> 58:13.761
I couldn't give a fuck. I just
want you out of my house.

58:14.961 --> 58:16.801
OK.

58:16.881 --> 58:19.121
If you don't care
about children.

58:19.201 --> 58:21.521
For what it's worth,
you're missing out

58:21.601 --> 58:23.321
on a really worthwhile cause.

58:23.401 --> 58:25.041
Yeah, I'll try
and live with that.

58:25.121 --> 58:28.721
So I saw all the climbing
pictures upstairs.

58:28.801 --> 58:30.401
So what?

58:30.481 --> 58:32.921
So I'm not leaving
without what I came for.

58:33.561 --> 58:35.841
Ah, for fuck's sake!

58:37.921 --> 58:40.241
Let go, you crazy bitch!

59:01.121 --> 59:03.121
<i>This is a farce.</i>

59:07.321 --> 59:09.561
<i>Are you fucking this up
deliberately?</i>

59:21.121 --> 59:22.921
What are you doing?

59:23.001 --> 59:25.561
Fucking hell.

59:29.681 --> 59:31.601
I've called the police.

59:31.681 --> 59:33.481
Shit.

59:33.561 --> 59:35.881
Better get on with it, then,
hadn't I?

59:38.921 --> 59:41.201
- Stop doing that.
- No.

59:48.561 --> 59:50.081
I'm gonna cut you.

59:50.161 --> 59:53.881
I told you I already give to
loads of different charities.

59:53.961 --> 59:56.321
What do you think this is,
some new initiative?

59:56.401 --> 59:59.201
You never know
with charities these days.

59:59.281 --> 01:00:00.881
You can't trust anyone.

01:00:01.561 --> 01:00:05.361
Well, that is true. I mean,
everyone's out for themselves.

01:00:05.441 --> 01:00:07.121
Ahh!

01:00:07.201 --> 01:00:08.561
You're insane.

01:00:08.641 --> 01:00:10.881
I am a working mother.

01:00:11.561 --> 01:00:15.001
It is not easy, meeting your
kids' demands these days.

01:00:15.081 --> 01:00:17.641
Stop moving forward
or I will hurt you.

01:00:17.721 --> 01:00:19.281
Tell me this, like,

01:00:19.361 --> 01:00:23.321
why do people pay for,
like, sporting activities?

01:00:23.401 --> 01:00:26.121
- I mean, I just don't get it.
- It makes you stronger.

01:00:26.201 --> 01:00:27.641
Does it, though?

01:00:27.721 --> 01:00:30.761
It's just like following
an instructor

01:00:30.841 --> 01:00:32.881
like a bunch of sheep.

01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:34.961
It's kind of weak-minded.

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:38.361
A load of people
searching for a purpose.

01:00:38.441 --> 01:00:40.161
I've already got one.

01:00:43.921 --> 01:00:45.521
My baby.

01:00:47.201 --> 01:00:50.441
Oh! Oh, I'm...
I'm really sorry.

01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:53.241
Are you OK? I'm... I'm...

01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:04.761
Do you know what really helps
with pain?

01:01:05.521 --> 01:01:07.641
Erm... if you relax.

01:01:07.721 --> 01:01:10.321
So if you sort of do
some breathing, like...

01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:17.241
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
That's it.

01:01:17.321 --> 01:01:19.641
That's better, right?

01:01:24.201 --> 01:01:26.841
Shit.

01:01:26.921 --> 01:01:28.481
Shit!

01:01:38.441 --> 01:01:39.761
Fuck.

01:01:46.561 --> 01:01:49.241
Police! Is anyone there?

01:01:51.081 --> 01:01:53.121
Hello?

01:01:55.881 --> 01:01:58.041
Police!

01:02:07.361 --> 01:02:09.081
Get away. You're not helping.

01:02:15.481 --> 01:02:17.201
Agh! Ugh!

01:03:16.841 --> 01:03:19.241
What happened to your eye,
Ruth?

01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:21.521
It's fine. I just knocked it.

01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:25.121
OK!

01:03:25.961 --> 01:03:29.561
Perfectly healthy little baby
in there.

01:03:31.081 --> 01:03:34.241
So, we're not out to get you.

01:03:36.001 --> 01:03:37.681
What?

01:03:37.761 --> 01:03:41.241
Well, there's no bad fairy
trying to put a curse on her.

01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:47.601
No, I don't think so.

01:03:49.961 --> 01:03:53.201
I would swap her
to have him back.

01:03:54.681 --> 01:03:56.401
That's not an option.

01:03:56.481 --> 01:03:58.521
I know,
but I wanted you to know that.

01:03:58.601 --> 01:04:01.001
OK, she can't hear you.

01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:03.881
That's not
what the baby manual says.

01:04:03.961 --> 01:04:07.121
Well, but she
can't understand English.

01:04:07.201 --> 01:04:09.721
She can.
She's very articulate.

01:04:11.561 --> 01:04:13.841
Ruth, you missed your scan.

01:04:18.081 --> 01:04:20.841
I don't wanna know what's
in there. I'm scared of her.

01:04:20.921 --> 01:04:23.721
I mean,
I'm not even in control.

01:04:23.801 --> 01:04:28.081
It's like I'm some crap,
banged-out car

01:04:28.161 --> 01:04:30.761
and she's driving -
I'm just the vehicle.

01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:33.401
Honestly, it's like
a hostile takeover.

01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:36.841
You missed your scan and that
was a very important scan.

01:04:36.921 --> 01:04:39.881
- She could come early.
- No. No, no, no, no.

01:04:39.961 --> 01:04:42.641
No, no, no. No.
I need more time.

01:04:42.721 --> 01:04:45.081
She comes
when she wants to come.

01:04:46.161 --> 01:04:49.121
I've held back
on telling social services.

01:04:49.201 --> 01:04:51.681
I've put my job on the line,
Ruth, for you.

01:05:00.161 --> 01:05:01.641
I'm really sorry
about your loss

01:05:01.721 --> 01:05:04.161
and I know it's been
very difficult for you.

01:05:06.561 --> 01:05:08.321
But you're going to be OK.

01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:10.401
And the baby's gonna be OK.

01:05:13.321 --> 01:05:15.441
I'm here to help you.

01:05:16.121 --> 01:05:17.801
What's going on?

01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:20.241
Whatever it is,
it's got to stop.

01:05:59.601 --> 01:06:01.601
I can't do it, Matt.

01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:09.241
Make me do it.

01:06:14.121 --> 01:06:16.121
I don't know what to do.

01:06:57.761 --> 01:07:00.681
<i>...and reach over
with the right.</i>

01:07:01.441 --> 01:07:03.441
Stretch out that side.

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:06.161
Keep your sitting bone
on the floor

01:07:06.241 --> 01:07:07.721
to really create a stretch.

01:07:08.561 --> 01:07:10.921
<i>Now an inhale.</i>

01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:13.521
<i>Arms up.</i>

01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:16.241
<i>Exhale, hands to heart centre.</i>

01:07:18.041 --> 01:07:20.481
A couple of breaths here.

01:07:21.521 --> 01:07:23.241
Lovely.

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:27.001
Now for your favourite part.

01:07:27.081 --> 01:07:29.721
Get down onto your backs
for Shavasana.

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:35.881
I'd like you all to scrunch up
your fists tight as you can.

01:07:35.961 --> 01:07:37.841
Take all the tension
in your body

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:39.921
and put it into your fists.

01:07:40.001 --> 01:07:41.881
Hold that for five counts.

01:07:42.681 --> 01:07:45.241
Five, four...

01:07:45.321 --> 01:07:47.761
three, two...

01:07:47.841 --> 01:07:49.001
one.

01:07:49.081 --> 01:07:50.681
Release.

01:07:51.721 --> 01:07:53.841
Let your whole body relax.

01:07:55.081 --> 01:07:58.561
With that release,
release all your worries.

01:07:59.521 --> 01:08:02.041
Any concerns
of what's to come.

01:08:05.441 --> 01:08:07.081
And relax.

01:08:23.961 --> 01:08:25.401
<i>It's very important</i>

01:08:25.481 --> 01:08:28.201
<i>to let the past
stay in the past.</i>

01:08:36.161 --> 01:08:40.881
You have to decide what's
right... and what's wrong.

01:08:44.241 --> 01:08:45.841
<i>I know what you did.</i>

01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:49.001
<i>You betrayed me to that bitch.</i>

01:08:55.961 --> 01:08:57.441
Do you understand?

01:08:58.401 --> 01:09:00.401
<i>You can't shake me.</i>

01:09:03.401 --> 01:09:04.881
<i>I'm fury.</i>

01:09:12.161 --> 01:09:13.600
<i>I'm in you.</i>

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.761
<i>I'm in you. I'm in you.</i>

01:09:15.841 --> 01:09:18.321
<i>I'm in you. I'm in you.</i>

01:09:18.401 --> 01:09:20.321
<i>Look, Mummy.</i>

01:09:22.801 --> 01:09:24.361
<i>Look!</i>

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.361
<i>Look.</i>

01:10:21.641 --> 01:10:23.721
I succumb to your will.

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:27.481
Baby knows best.

01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:32.641
<i>The instructor.</i>

01:10:32.721 --> 01:10:36.401
<i>He tells people what to do.</i>

01:10:36.481 --> 01:10:38.801
<i>But he won't control me.</i>

01:10:38.881 --> 01:10:41.761
<i>I'm not his puppet on a string
like all the others.</i>

01:10:42.561 --> 01:10:45.321
<i>Look, how funny, he's going to
a Halloween party.</i>

01:10:45.401 --> 01:10:47.441
<i>"Dress to distress."</i>

01:10:47.521 --> 01:10:49.201
<i>He won't need a costume.</i>

01:10:49.281 --> 01:10:51.281
<i>He's already got blood
on his hands.</i>

01:11:06.001 --> 01:11:08.201
<i>Get on with it.</i>

01:11:08.281 --> 01:11:10.281
I'm doing it.

01:11:11.321 --> 01:11:12.921
I can't go any faster.

01:11:34.441 --> 01:11:36.481
Ground floor, please.

01:11:36.561 --> 01:11:39.241
<i>What did I say would happen?</i>

01:11:39.321 --> 01:11:43.161
<i>If you don't do as I say,
blood will be shed...</i>

01:11:43.881 --> 01:11:45.881
<i>...one way or another.</i>

01:12:00.601 --> 01:12:02.081
<i>Monsters.</i>

01:12:08.721 --> 01:12:10.281
<i>All of them.</i>

01:12:11.641 --> 01:12:12.841
<i>Monsters.</i>

01:14:14.321 --> 01:14:17.281
No, no, no,
that's not the deal.

01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:20.681
I can't put her
in the same position.

01:14:20.761 --> 01:14:24.081
<i>He was the only one
who ever loved you.</i>

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:31.441
<i>If you loved him,
finish the job.</i>

01:14:42.361 --> 01:14:43.881
<i>It's an act of love.</i>

01:14:45.361 --> 01:14:47.561
<i>It's all you have, isn't it?</i>

01:14:48.561 --> 01:14:50.761
<i>What else is there?</i>

01:14:50.841 --> 01:14:54.401
<i>No family, no faith,
no friends.</i>

01:14:54.481 --> 01:14:56.481
<i>No future.</i>

01:14:56.561 --> 01:15:00.921
<i>Look at you.
In love with the past.</i>

01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:04.001
<i>Kill him. Or I kill you.</i>

01:15:13.081 --> 01:15:14.681
Jess! What...?

01:15:15.721 --> 01:15:18.241
I thought I recognised you.

01:15:19.761 --> 01:15:21.561
Oh, yeah,
from that climbing centre.

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:24.521
This is what
I really look like.

01:15:24.601 --> 01:15:26.681
From the inquest.

01:15:26.761 --> 01:15:29.001
- I knew it was you.
- Oh, the inquest.

01:15:31.721 --> 01:15:33.161
I didn't know...

01:15:33.241 --> 01:15:35.481
You didn't know about this?

01:15:35.561 --> 01:15:37.481
Not many people know.

01:15:37.561 --> 01:15:39.241
I kept it quiet.

01:15:39.321 --> 01:15:41.041
Did he know?

01:15:42.441 --> 01:15:44.681
You're having a baby,
aren't you?

01:15:44.761 --> 01:15:46.441
Yeah, two months.

01:15:48.321 --> 01:15:52.881
Yeah, you see, your baby
was born of pleasure.

01:15:54.041 --> 01:15:56.601
My baby is born of pain.

01:15:58.001 --> 01:15:59.881
I found out
on the day he died.

01:15:59.961 --> 01:16:01.721
That's terrible.

01:16:03.121 --> 01:16:04.601
You're grieving.

01:16:04.681 --> 01:16:08.241
I'm not grieving!
I'm gestating!

01:16:08.321 --> 01:16:10.161
Fucking rage.

01:16:13.081 --> 01:16:14.361
Look...

01:16:15.401 --> 01:16:17.641
...I went through this...

01:16:17.721 --> 01:16:19.401
over and over again.

01:16:20.441 --> 01:16:22.201
There was nothing else
we could do.

01:16:22.281 --> 01:16:23.521
We?

01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:26.641
It was a group decision.

01:16:27.361 --> 01:16:28.961
You were in charge, though.

01:16:29.041 --> 01:16:31.201
I had to think of everyone.

01:16:31.281 --> 01:16:33.721
It was a matter
of life or death.

01:16:34.721 --> 01:16:36.321
It was unavoidable.

01:16:36.401 --> 01:16:37.921
It was easy!

01:16:38.001 --> 01:16:41.201
- No.
- You made a selfish decision

01:16:41.281 --> 01:16:45.641
that suited all of you without
a thought for anyone else,

01:16:45.721 --> 01:16:48.561
and you got away with it,
scot-free.

01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:50.081
Who cut the cord?

01:16:50.161 --> 01:16:51.961
I'm sorry.

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:56.041
Who cut the fucking cord?

01:16:57.361 --> 01:16:59.881
- I'm sorry...
- It's not good enough!

01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:04.441
Not good enough.

01:17:04.521 --> 01:17:06.121
Please.

01:17:09.601 --> 01:17:11.681
This isn't helping anyone.

01:17:14.041 --> 01:17:16.161
I spoke to him before he died.

01:17:16.241 --> 01:17:17.681
What do you mean?

01:17:17.761 --> 01:17:20.361
I know that things weren't
great between you two.

01:17:20.441 --> 01:17:22.521
I know that he was thinking
about leaving you.

01:17:22.601 --> 01:17:24.081
No!

01:17:27.721 --> 01:17:29.521
Let me help you.

01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:31.761
Jess! Let me help you.

01:17:31.841 --> 01:17:33.601
Let me help you.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:48.841
<i>I am about to take
my last voyage.</i>

01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:53.081
<i>A great leap in the dark.</i>

01:18:41.681 --> 01:18:43.961
Good morning, Mummy.

01:18:44.801 --> 01:18:47.601
We managed to collect
your things for you.

01:18:49.401 --> 01:18:51.161
She's just normal.

01:18:51.241 --> 01:18:53.601
She's just a normal
little baby.

01:18:55.801 --> 01:18:58.121
Well, of course she is.
I told you.

01:18:58.201 --> 01:19:00.721
And you're just
a normal mummy, too.

01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:08.881
Look, I know the caesarean
wasn't meant to happen,

01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:12.561
but when it's life or death,
we have to make that cut.

01:19:13.241 --> 01:19:14.881
I understand that now.

01:19:19.681 --> 01:19:23.121
Just be grateful you've got
a happy, healthy little girl.

01:19:25.401 --> 01:19:27.721
I know it wasn't in
your birth plan, Ruth.

01:19:28.601 --> 01:19:33.561
I hadn't really considered the
birth in terms of the plans.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:36.081
OK.

01:19:37.201 --> 01:19:40.001
Well, we've got that far now,
haven't we?

01:19:40.081 --> 01:19:42.041
It's all change.

01:19:42.121 --> 01:19:44.481
All about
what is best for baby.

01:19:48.281 --> 01:19:50.601
I've done
some really terrible things.

01:19:51.601 --> 01:19:54.041
I've done really bad things.
I've got it all wrong.

01:19:54.121 --> 01:19:57.001
Look, we all get it wrong.

01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:58.721
Always.

01:19:58.801 --> 01:20:00.201
It's fine.

01:20:00.281 --> 01:20:02.441
You see. I thought
