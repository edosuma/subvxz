(man speaking Russian)

00:04.738 --> 00:07.575
(man #2 speaking Russian)

00:07.608 --> 00:10.778
ANNOUNCER: The Americans,
all new Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.082
ANNOUNCER: FX presents

00:14.115 --> 00:16.117
Feud: Bette and Joan.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.326
Miss Davis?

00:25.359 --> 00:26.594
Buzz Gimple.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.263
May I say what an honor
it is to meet you?

00:29.297 --> 00:31.365
I see Sid's got himself
a Boy Friday.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.766
I approve.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.536
Oh, I'm not Sid's secretary.
I'm your agent.

00:35.569 --> 00:39.373
I will be personally looking
after your day-to-day concerns.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.445
How old are you?

00:44.478 --> 00:45.913
Almost 23.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.381
Almost?
Mm-hmm.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.517
MARTY:
Joanie!

00:49.550 --> 00:50.918
You look ravishing.
Oh. (laughs)

00:50.951 --> 00:52.553
You know the team.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.622
Yes.
Would you care
for something to drink?

00:54.655 --> 00:56.957
Oh, no thank you. I'd like
to get right down to business.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.126
Please sit down.

00:58.159 --> 01:01.195
Marty, I would like

01:01.229 --> 01:05.299
to take the twins to Greece
and Italy this year.

01:05.333 --> 01:09.103
Every young person should
experience ancient antiquities.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.439
So when do you think would be
a good time to schedule that?

01:11.472 --> 01:13.274
Well, probably not August.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.309
Gets pretty hot in Greece
in August.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.878
Right, boys?

01:17.911 --> 01:20.148
Well, no. I-I...

01:20.181 --> 01:22.950
I don't know what kind of offers
have been coming in,

01:22.983 --> 01:24.952
so I thought
we might review them

01:24.985 --> 01:27.621
and, uh, then I could plan
accordingly.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.390
BETTE:
Nothing?

01:29.423 --> 01:32.160
At the moment,
but we're gonna change that.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.894
I wouldn't think
I need to mention

01:33.927 --> 01:36.730
that I am opening a
picture very soon.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.432
Yeah.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.101
What I'd like to do is
maybe secure a few things

01:41.135 --> 01:43.237
before the movie opens.

01:43.271 --> 01:46.174
A guest spot on Perry Mason,
or, you know,

01:46.207 --> 01:48.909
dinner theater has become
very chic again.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.745
MARTY: There hasn't been
any offers, Joan.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.947
Well, how is that possible?

01:53.981 --> 01:55.983
I'm headlining

01:56.016 --> 01:58.852
a major motion picture
which opens in

01:58.886 --> 02:03.357
400 theaters nationwide
in just a few weeks' time.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.959
And we're very excited
about that. Aren't we, fellas?

02:08.329 --> 02:10.598
I did my part, Marty.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.500
I got myself

02:12.533 --> 02:14.168
back in the game.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.803
I found the project,

02:15.836 --> 02:18.172
I put up with
that awful woman for months.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.508
And while I was
suffering all that,

02:20.541 --> 02:26.013
what was William Morris
doing for me?

02:26.046 --> 02:28.115
The landscape
hasn't changed, Joan.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.651
There's just not a lot out there
for a mature actress.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.854
BETTE: You've heard
the picture's stinko.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.723
You can't pay attention
to the tongue wagging

02:35.756 --> 02:37.157
that goes on in this town.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.626
They're always rooting
for failure.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.461
What have they
been saying?

02:40.494 --> 02:43.564
Well...

02:43.597 --> 02:47.067
word around town is
you and Crawford won't be able

02:47.100 --> 02:49.403
to get arrested
after the movie opens.

02:49.437 --> 02:52.840
They're saying you've thrown
what's left of your careers

02:52.873 --> 02:55.509
down the toilet
by doing a "B" movie.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.013
I see.

03:00.047 --> 03:03.651
That explains why I've been
shunted to the junior leagues.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.219
No offense.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.255
None taken.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.990
Don't give up
the ghost, Miss Davis.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.661
Worst case, the movie bombs
and people forget all about it.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.163
You'll be back.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.865
JOAN:
Well, I'm sure

03:17.898 --> 03:20.234
once the picture opens,
there'll be no end of offers.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.370
And we'll be here to field them.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.341
Fuck you, Marty.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.009
If I have to

03:29.042 --> 03:32.413
find my own projects
and wait for you

03:32.446 --> 03:35.249
to field offers
instead of drumming them up,

03:35.283 --> 03:37.685
I don't see the point
in having an agent,

03:37.718 --> 03:40.388
or a room full
of fucking agents.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.989
You're all fired!

03:46.093 --> 03:48.396
(thunder rumbling softly)

03:56.003 --> 03:57.571
Hey, Buzz.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.373
Looks like you
lost a client.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.375
Somebody die?
Not a person.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.478
Just your credibility.
Page seven.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.947
BETTE:
"Mother of three,

04:06.980 --> 04:09.617
"30 years experience

04:09.650 --> 04:12.920

04:17.491 --> 04:20.294

04:51.525 --> 04:53.527

05:20.888 --> 05:23.891
(seagulls chirping,
waves crashing)

05:42.009 --> 05:45.012
JOAN:
You must listen.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.581
I made you waste...

05:47.615 --> 05:50.751
your whole life...

05:50.784 --> 05:53.554
thinking you'd crippled me.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.822
(projector clicks off)

05:54.855 --> 05:55.923
(clears throat)

05:55.956 --> 05:57.725
It's seamless, Mike.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.327
I can't see where the beach ends
and the soundstage begins.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.429
Thanks, honey.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.863
What do we
think, Skipper?

06:02.896 --> 06:05.098
Yeah. Lock the picture, Mike.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.867
Make sure the optical print
is ready

06:06.900 --> 06:08.368
for the sneak preview
on Saturday.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.270
Do we know where
that's happening yet?

06:10.303 --> 06:12.873
It's either Pedro or Long Beach.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.341
Sure that's
far enough away?

06:14.374 --> 06:17.177
Well, I figure
they're both ports.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.279
I can always hop on a freighter
and make my escape.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.515
Is the picture
still running?

06:21.549 --> 06:24.652
Because you two both sound
like a couple of old biddies.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.957
PAULINE: Why is everyone acting
like it's a failure

06:29.990 --> 06:31.391
when it hasn't
even opened yet?

06:31.425 --> 06:32.760
ROBERT:
You hear that whistling sound?

06:32.793 --> 06:34.094
It's a bomb falling.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.029
It's gonna land in 400 theaters,
all at the same time.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.297
I don't agree.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.799
You know who goes
to the movies nowadays?

06:38.832 --> 06:40.233
Kids and teenagers.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.069
I mean, nobody
under the age of 35

06:42.102 --> 06:43.771
even knows
who these women are.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.205
You're wrong
there, Bob.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.641
This is where television
actually helps us.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.443
Kids today-- they grew up

06:49.477 --> 06:52.446
watching old Crawford and Davis
movies on Sunday afternoons.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.947
They know who they are.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.216
And don't you forget,
they said the same thing

06:56.249 --> 06:58.151
about Gloria Swanson
ten years ago.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.887
Sunset Boulevard
had Bill Holden.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.321
It's not the same thing at all.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.991
What you got there?

07:04.024 --> 07:06.660
It's a script.
Oh, honey,

07:06.694 --> 07:08.462
I can't even think
about the next thing right now.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.964
No, no, no, of course not.

07:10.998 --> 07:14.001
Hell, I'm not even convinced
there's gonna be a next thing.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.637
So, you coming to the public
execution on Saturday?

07:16.670 --> 07:18.906
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.641
I don't say this
often enough, Pauline.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.076
I couldn't have done it
without you.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.279
Correct on both counts.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.148
Go on, get drunk.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.986
ROBERT: Harriet, we may
have to sell the house.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.988
What, are you worried
about the picture?

07:35.022 --> 07:37.290
I think I may have
misjudged the moment.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.326
You know, I wanted
to get it done,

07:39.359 --> 07:42.195
I wanted a measure of
control, but now we're...

07:42.229 --> 07:44.498
We're in hoc up to our eyeballs.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.867
If Baby Jan goes down,
so do we.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.335
Is it not good?

07:48.368 --> 07:50.604
Honestly, I can't tell anymore.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.205
Well, we knew it was
a gamble from the start.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.608
If we have to sell the house,
we'll sell the house.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.209
Yeah, what about the kids?

07:56.243 --> 07:57.778
We'll sell them, too.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.980
But I think we'll get
more for the house.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.381
(laughs)

08:01.414 --> 08:04.117
You don't have to go down
with the ship, you know.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.853
If you divorce me
before Saturday,

08:05.886 --> 08:07.320
you might still get something.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.056
Oh, I'm no fool.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.191
I'll wait until your next
hit before I divorce you.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.392
(laughs) I see.

08:12.425 --> 08:13.727
So you'll stick around
for worse,

08:13.761 --> 08:14.962
but if better comes along,

08:14.995 --> 08:16.564
you're on the phone
to the lawyer?

08:20.734 --> 08:22.703
Try not to worry so much.

08:22.736 --> 08:26.306
You know that you always get
like this before a preview.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.209
(rain falling)

08:29.242 --> 08:31.244
*

08:34.381 --> 08:40.688
* When you're young
and so in love as we *

08:40.721 --> 08:42.355
* And bewildered *
(doorbell rings)

08:42.389 --> 08:45.325
* By the world we see *

08:45.358 --> 08:46.493
(vacuum stops)

08:46.526 --> 08:49.663
* Why do people hurt us so? *

08:49.697 --> 08:52.666
* Only those in love
would know... *

08:52.700 --> 08:54.101
Mamacita.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.368
Miss Crawford is out.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.571
That's good.
May I come in?

08:57.605 --> 09:01.374
* What a town without pity
can do... *

09:01.408 --> 09:03.010
PAULINE:
It's called The Black Slipper.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.845
It's written just for Joan.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.048
She'd play a choreographer
falsely accused

09:08.081 --> 09:10.718
of shoving a principal dancer
off a catwalk.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.686
She gets locked up
for murder,

09:12.720 --> 09:15.055
pushed around by some
hard-bitten convict broads.

09:15.088 --> 09:18.792
Then she's proven innocent
and whisked from her cell

09:18.826 --> 09:22.562
to dance the dead girl's
role on stage.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.601
It's a story about
the irrepressible human sprit.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.639
You want to leave the
script for Miss Crawford?

09:33.941 --> 09:36.476
You're Joan's right-hand lady.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.947
I know what that means because
I'm a right-hand lady, too.

09:39.980 --> 09:43.150
You know better than anybody
how to get Joan on board.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.885
I want

09:44.918 --> 09:47.655
your advice
on how to do that for this.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.390
I see.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.392
Mr. Aldrich will direct?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.494
No.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.296
Who is involved?

09:56.329 --> 09:59.166
Me. I wrote it.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.768
And I want to direct.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.770
Look, I realize

10:02.803 --> 10:06.073
there is not exactly
a robust tradition

10:06.106 --> 10:08.008
of women directors
for me to build on.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.943
Only a handful of gals
have gotten studios

10:09.977 --> 10:11.879
to trust that they could
handle a picture.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.749
You think I'm crazy?

10:15.783 --> 10:19.352
I think this is
a marvelous idea.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.988
You do?

10:21.021 --> 10:22.422
This is America.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.191
No one can tell you
you're crazy.

10:24.224 --> 10:29.029
In Werdohl, you know how you
must live when you are born.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.131
Born to a shoemaker,
you must make shoes.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.333
Born a girl,
you must be a mother.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.535
Here, you decide.

10:35.568 --> 10:39.006
There is opportunity to
become anything you want.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.641
I will make your
case with Miss Joan.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.748
(gentle piano music playing)

10:50.650 --> 10:52.052
Miss Crawford!

10:52.085 --> 10:53.721
You're in early this evening.
Yes.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.823
And looking
particularly stunning.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.290
Oh, why, thank you, Philip.
(chuckles)

10:57.324 --> 10:59.960
Yes, we're motoring on
to Long Beach this evening

10:59.993 --> 11:02.195
to catch a new motion picture.
Oh.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.898
Oh, does Baby Doll
premiere tonight?

11:04.932 --> 11:06.066
Baby Jane.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.534
No, and it's not
a premiere.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.803
It's merely a preview.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.472
But the stars will be in
attendance. How thrilling.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.142
Well, I'm afraid
my costar

11:15.175 --> 11:17.544
felt it more urgent
to travel to Maine

11:17.577 --> 11:19.312
to visit her daughter.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.415
I actually think
Miss Davis smelled failure

11:22.449 --> 11:24.718
in the air and ran away,
but not me.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.219
Win, lose or draw,

11:26.253 --> 11:29.522
I'll always show up on time,
hit my mark

11:29.556 --> 11:32.359
and promote the product,
whether it's Pepsi-Cola

11:32.392 --> 11:34.027
or a new motion picture.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.029
Michael will be your waiter
this evening.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.902
JOAN:
Are they still watching?

11:41.935 --> 11:44.037
MAMACITA:
Is who still watching?

11:44.071 --> 11:45.773
(whispers):
Everybody.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.043
Yes.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.279
They smell blood
in the water.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.380
They are smiling.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.415
Well, of course
they're smiling.

11:55.448 --> 11:59.119
"Why, I can smile and murder
whiles I smile."

12:02.823 --> 12:03.857
(laughs)

12:03.891 --> 12:06.226
Jackals.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.796
It's just like 1937
all over again.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.263
When Hitler took Austria.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.933
No, when they labeled me
box office poison.

12:12.966 --> 12:16.703
(whispers): I couldn't get
arrested in this goddamn town.

12:16.736 --> 12:20.307
But I was a young woman then.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.811
I still had time to claw my way
back to the top.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.578
But not now.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.415
Baby Jane was
my last chance.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.817
Maybe not.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.318
I read
a beautiful script today

12:31.351 --> 12:33.486
with a wonderful role for you.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.622
Pauline dropped it off
at the house.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.958
Who is Pauline?

12:37.991 --> 12:40.460
You've met her over 50 times.
She works for Mr. Aldrich.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.296
Bob has a new script.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.165
Well, why didn't you tell me?

12:45.198 --> 12:46.733
Not Mr. Aldrich.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.936
Miss Pauline--
she wrote this script.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.471
But Bob will direct it.
No.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.573
She would also direct
the picture.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.242
And you would star.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.577
Oh, Christ.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.646
A woman director.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.482
(chuckles)
Well, it really is over.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.286
(taps glass)

13:15.628 --> 13:17.530
ROBERT:
Please tell me these canisters

13:17.564 --> 13:19.699
are marked correctly.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.301
At the preview for
Kiss Me Deadly,

13:21.334 --> 13:23.103
the canisters got switched.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.138
The atomic bomb went off
in the second act.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.507
I hear this one
bombs in the first.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.576
Just eat your
goddamned sandwich.

13:41.688 --> 13:44.858
Well, it's time to face
the music, Mamacita.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.529
(lively orchestral music
playing)

14:11.851 --> 14:13.820
All right, Blanche Hudson!

14:13.853 --> 14:17.657
Miss big, fat movie star!

14:17.690 --> 14:20.593
Miss rotten, stinking actress!

14:20.627 --> 14:22.395
Blanche.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.065
You aren't ever
gonna sell this house.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.401
And you aren't ever gonna
leave it either.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.038
(dramatic orchestral music
playing)

14:36.043 --> 14:37.544
(crowd gasps)

14:37.577 --> 14:38.445
(screams)

14:38.478 --> 14:41.448
(orchestral music swells)

14:41.481 --> 14:43.450
(laughing)

14:43.483 --> 14:45.518
(laughing)

14:45.552 --> 14:46.987
(Blanche crying)

14:48.989 --> 14:50.991
(dramatic orchestral music
playing)

14:53.093 --> 14:55.162
(crowd cheering)

15:11.811 --> 15:13.646
JOAN:
Mamacita, they loved it.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.915
They loved you,
Miss Joan.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.650
ROBERT: You know, Warner
is gonna have trouble

15:17.684 --> 15:19.786
hiding the profits
on this one.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.854
Mm... Bob.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.325
WOMAN: It's Joan
Crawford! (gasps)

15:25.358 --> 15:28.095
(crowd murmuring excitedly)

15:31.264 --> 15:33.266
(Joan laughs)

15:35.102 --> 15:36.603
JOAN:
Did you enjoy the film?

15:36.636 --> 15:38.138
(laughs):
Did you?

15:38.171 --> 15:40.773
Oh, thank you for coming.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.644
(mouthing)

16:01.228 --> 16:03.696
(band playing upbeat pop music)

16:03.730 --> 16:07.667
* What ever happened
to Baby Jane? *

16:07.700 --> 16:09.269
* She could dance *

16:09.302 --> 16:11.004
* She could sing *

16:11.038 --> 16:13.940
* Make the biggest theater
ring *

16:13.973 --> 16:16.343
* Jane could do most anything *

16:16.376 --> 16:19.012
* What ever happened
to Baby Jane? *

16:21.314 --> 16:24.517
* What ever happened
to Baby Jane? *

16:24.551 --> 16:28.355
* When she'd walk
down the street *

16:28.388 --> 16:30.823
* All the world was lying
at her feet *

16:30.857 --> 16:33.126
* There was no one
half as sweet *

16:33.160 --> 16:36.596
* What ever happened
to Baby Jane? *

16:38.531 --> 16:42.235
* I see her old movies on TV *

16:42.269 --> 16:45.405
* And they are always
a thrill to me *

16:45.438 --> 16:48.675
* My daddy says I can be
just like her *

16:48.708 --> 16:52.679
* How I wish, I wish, I wish,
I wish I were *

16:52.712 --> 16:55.248
* What ever happened
to Baby Jane? *

16:55.282 --> 16:56.916
(applause)

16:56.949 --> 17:00.387
* To her smile,
her golden hair *

17:00.420 --> 17:02.655
* Why must everything
be so unfair? *

17:02.689 --> 17:05.058
* Is there no one
left to care? *

17:05.092 --> 17:08.361
* What happened to Baby Jane? *

17:08.395 --> 17:10.397
* What really happened
to Baby Jane? *

17:10.430 --> 17:12.399
Enjoy the show.
It's a lot of fun.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.734
Yeah, nothing more fun
than a hit.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.270
* To Baby Jane? *

17:17.304 --> 17:19.272
(song ends)

17:19.306 --> 17:21.308
(applause)

17:25.478 --> 17:27.280
JOAN:
Oh, Christ.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.116
Miss Crawford

17:29.149 --> 17:31.718
is such a sweetly smiling fraud

17:31.751 --> 17:34.721
that one feels
virtually nothing for her.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.690
No wonder her crazy sister
finds her a deadly bore.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.892
That's what you get for reading
The New York Times.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.594
It's one review, Joan.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.530
The notices have been
uniformly good.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.598
Oh, good.
Oh, there've been raves.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.467
But they're all about her.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.137
Listen.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.105
"A brilliant tour-de-force."

17:52.139 --> 17:54.274
"A brave and
naked portrayal."

17:54.307 --> 17:57.777
"You won't be able to take
your eyes off Miss Davis."

17:57.810 --> 17:59.279
She has the critics,
so what?

17:59.312 --> 18:00.813
You have the audience.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.750
You're the one they're
rooting for, not her.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.652
You know, I-I really

18:05.685 --> 18:08.087
thought this film was
going to be a flop.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.157
I really did, Hedda.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.625
And I thought, "Well,
this is going to kill me."

18:12.659 --> 18:15.295
But now I wish it had
because this is even worse.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.064
It's like I wasn't even
in the goddamned picture.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.633
And now there's talk
of Oscar nominations.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.303
She'll get a nomination,
but so will you.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.805
Oh, you can't really
believe that.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.508
They wouldn't dare
nominate her and not you.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.777
Yes, all right,
she plays a lunatic,

18:30.810 --> 18:32.645
but you play a cripple.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.785
JACK: Bobby, my boy,
we're breaking records!

18:38.818 --> 18:41.254
Yeah, the picture's
doing pretty good.
Pretty good?

18:41.288 --> 18:43.856
Baby Jane is the number one
picture in America.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.926
Well, actually, it's more like
number eight so far this year.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.462
No. For what we spent on it,
it's number one.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.764
(both laugh)
Come on, sit down.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.334
All right, so what's this
I hear from your agent, huh?

18:54.367 --> 18:55.968
I sent you half
a dozen scripts.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.470
You don't like
any of them?

18:57.504 --> 18:59.839
They're all Baby Jane
all over again.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.974
Well, that's 'cause you
hit on a winning formula.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.976
It's not a formula, Jack;
it was one movie.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.513
Which nearly killed me being
locked up with those two dames.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.515
I want to do something a lot
less dangerous, you know?

19:08.548 --> 19:11.551
Like a, uh,
like a war picture or a Western.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.952
No. Let's leave
the war pictures

19:12.985 --> 19:14.887
and the Westerns
to John Ford, okay?

19:14.921 --> 19:16.623
When it comes
to two broads

19:16.656 --> 19:18.024
beating the hell
out of each other,

19:18.057 --> 19:19.526
that's where
you really shine.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.860
No, Jack.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.495
No more "B" horror movies.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.131
I'm capable
of so much more.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.800
I'm back now. I want to show
people what I can really do.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.303
Wh-What, like your
Oscar-winning masterpiece?

19:30.337 --> 19:33.072
Why not?

19:33.105 --> 19:34.974
Well...

19:35.007 --> 19:37.176
How about because that's
never gonna happen?

19:37.210 --> 19:39.145
I mean, what
do you think,

19:39.178 --> 19:41.414
you're like a big star
director all of a sudden, Bob?

19:41.448 --> 19:42.682
I mean, no offense,

19:42.715 --> 19:44.517
but you're a journeyman.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.085
Strictly "B" list.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.355
Don't start getting
ideas in your head

19:48.388 --> 19:49.822
that you're like
Michelangelo.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.157
You know, you're the wop

19:51.190 --> 19:53.693
working in the
fucking tile factory.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.528
We need tiles.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.330
Yeah, well, even the schmuck
in the tile factory

19:57.364 --> 19:58.565
has dreams, Jack.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.035
Dreams are delusions.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.372
And right now,
you're delusional.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.942
The next script I give you,
you're gonna do.

20:11.811 --> 20:15.282
Well, thank you for
the opportunity of Baby Jane.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.450
I really appreciate it,
Jack.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.920
But I'm done with horror
and aging actresses.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.422
I'm not gonna say yes
to anything

20:22.455 --> 20:24.424
that doesn't challenge me.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.760
Okay.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.396
Fine.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.230
Go get challenged.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.800
But when your next
movie is a bomb,

20:33.833 --> 20:35.535
or the one after that,

20:35.568 --> 20:37.937
you'll be back.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.740
And you know what?

20:40.773 --> 20:42.709
I'll probably
take your call.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.578
Do you know why?

20:45.612 --> 20:48.014
'Cause I got a soft spot
for losers, Bobby.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.285
A soft spot.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.687
You'll be back.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.226
(knocking on door)

21:00.259 --> 21:02.261
Come in.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.398
Miss Pauline.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.767
Oh. Pauline, hello.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.936
No, Mamacita,
please stay.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.405
This pile is for charity.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.240
But all of that,

21:14.273 --> 21:16.743
I want you to hang back up
in the closet, please.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.277
A little early
spring cleaning?

21:18.311 --> 21:20.447
Thank you for
coming to see me.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.081
Thank you for asking.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.117
And congratulations,
by the way, on Baby Jane.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.620
You couldn't pay
for better reviews.

21:27.654 --> 21:30.923
I let the fans tell me
when a picture is successful,

21:30.957 --> 21:32.325
not the critics.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.597
Pauline, I want to thank you
for passing this along to me.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.632
I did you the courtesy
of not reading it.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.335
I see no reason
to venture an opinion

21:42.369 --> 21:45.004
on something I have
no intention of doing.

21:45.037 --> 21:49.642
Well, I wish you
would reconsider.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.978
I know that
it's unorthodox,

21:52.011 --> 21:55.281
the idea of a woman director,
but it's not unprecedented.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.549
Think of the women

21:56.583 --> 21:58.618
who ruled the silent era.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.521
Where are they now?

22:01.554 --> 22:03.490
What do you guess prevented

22:03.523 --> 22:05.792
the next great wave
of women directors?

22:05.825 --> 22:07.794
I don't know.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.729
Well, I do. I was there.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.230
Money.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.533
Money came along.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.369
Silents were
low-cost, low-risk.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.671
A producer might shrug
at the idea

22:18.705 --> 22:21.173
of an ingГ©nue
or girl editor

22:21.207 --> 22:23.242
taking a turn behind the camera,

22:23.275 --> 22:25.745
but when the studios
came to power,

22:25.778 --> 22:28.915
they moved women
to the feminine work.

22:28.948 --> 22:32.519
Costumes, continuity.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.754
Directors needed stamina,

22:34.787 --> 22:38.157
leadership,
fiscal responsibility,

22:38.190 --> 22:40.192
so men were given the bullhorn.

22:40.226 --> 22:43.496
And I can't say that we are
any worse off for it.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.098
M-Miss Crawford.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.435
I just need
my first bite.

22:48.468 --> 22:51.070
Men, they will hire
based on potential,

22:51.103 --> 22:53.806
but women, we need experience.

22:55.475 --> 22:59.746
I'm not turning you down
because you're a woman.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.784
I'm turning you down
because you're a nobody.

23:04.817 --> 23:09.355
And at this late stage
of my career,

23:09.388 --> 23:11.424
I don't have the luxury

23:11.458 --> 23:16.128
of putting myself
in the hands of a nobody.

23:16.162 --> 23:21.133
I have very few chances left.

23:21.167 --> 23:25.638
And my last chance is not
going to be your first.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.674
I hope you understand that.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.345
I'm sorry I took up your time.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.650
Pauline.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.619
You should consider
yourself lucky.

23:39.652 --> 23:42.755
You get to work with the best
Hollywood has to offer.

23:42.789 --> 23:46.593
I mean, if you're seen
grabbing for too much,

23:46.626 --> 23:48.628
you may appear ungrateful.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.464
I appreciate that advice.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.974
OLIVIA:
It was a sensation.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.010
You have to understand
that women's movies

24:04.043 --> 24:07.480
had been out of vogue
for quite some time.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.816
I think the biggest moneymaker

24:09.849 --> 24:12.585
that year was
Lawrence of Arabia.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.287
I don't think there was even
a girl camel in that one.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.623
(chuckles)

24:16.656 --> 24:20.126
So with two women stars
of our era

24:20.159 --> 24:23.129
to suddenly have
the most successful picture

24:23.162 --> 24:26.666
in the theaters
among young people, well,

24:26.699 --> 24:29.135
we thought it signaled
a sea change.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.337
We had thought we'd
all start working again.
Mm-hmm.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.005
That there'd be a flood
of women's pictures.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.440
It didn't turn
out that way.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.942
Sure as hell didn't.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.777
The studios thought
it was a fluke.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.112
They always think it's a fluke
when a picture carried

24:40.146 --> 24:42.849
by the girls succeeds
at the box office.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.483
And they so often do.

24:44.517 --> 24:46.686
Baby Jane was hot.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.221
But Joan felt left out
in the cold.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.691
She did what actors have done
since Euripides--

24:51.724 --> 24:53.693
she started hitting the bottle.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.027
ADAM: So you're saying,
on the record,

24:55.061 --> 24:56.663
that Joan Crawford
was an alcoholic?

24:56.696 --> 24:59.532
Oh, I'm not saying it, honey.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.568
Joan herself said it.

25:01.601 --> 25:04.403
Quote, "The twin curses
of being a star

25:04.436 --> 25:06.405
are alcoholism and loneliness."

25:06.438 --> 25:07.674
End quote.

25:07.707 --> 25:11.010
Can you explain
that sentiment to me?

25:11.043 --> 25:13.713
Well, the highs
you experience being a star,

25:13.746 --> 25:16.082
they're incredible.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.251
When you're in a role,
you get to fall in love.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.687
You get to be

25:20.720 --> 25:22.321
glamorous.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.892
You can tell people
how you feel deep down inside.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.027
Oh, it's a constant high.

25:28.060 --> 25:31.263
And then, when you don't
have a job, a success,

25:31.297 --> 25:34.601
or someone else
is riding high,

25:34.634 --> 25:37.269
it gets very, very quiet.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.575
You can hear
the voices of doubt.

25:42.609 --> 25:46.746
Pick up a bottle, and suddenly
the party starts all over again.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.781
Pain goes away.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.817
(doorbell rings)

25:52.885 --> 25:54.220
Get her.

25:56.455 --> 25:59.058
(liquid pouring)

26:01.628 --> 26:03.229
Well, look who's here.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.231
If it isn't Jack Warn...
What is this shit

26:05.264 --> 26:07.399
about you not wanting
to promote the picture?

26:07.433 --> 26:09.435
Jesus Christ, Joan.

26:09.468 --> 26:11.437
I already have
a cross-country tour announced

26:11.470 --> 26:12.905
for the two of you.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.641
I'm not traveling
with that woman.

26:14.674 --> 26:15.942
(groans)

26:15.975 --> 26:19.545
Besides, why should
I promote your picture

26:19.578 --> 26:21.480
when you won't return the favor?

26:21.513 --> 26:24.550
I know you have
been out there

26:24.583 --> 26:28.420
actively campaigning for Davis
for Best Actress.

26:28.454 --> 26:30.723
Yeah, I have. And I've been
doing the same for you.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.091
(scoffs)
You got to get over this.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.426
This is one of
the biggest successes

26:34.460 --> 26:35.895
you've had in years.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.563
And instead of
going out there

26:37.596 --> 26:39.732
and promoting it
and making it bigger,

26:39.766 --> 26:40.933
what are you doing?

26:40.967 --> 26:42.168
You're sitting around here
getting pickled.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.070
I'm not pickled.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.471
Like a herring.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.239
It's 11:00 in the morning.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.175
Look, Jack...
(groans)

26:49.208 --> 26:51.177
I need your support.
Jesus.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.079
I mean, come on.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.147
I mean, if she gets
nominated and I don't...
Honey...

26:55.181 --> 26:57.149
...I don't know
what I'm gonna do about it.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.819
I mean, I need you to push
just as hard for me...
Okay. All right.

26:59.852 --> 27:02.321
...as you are for her.
Come on. Even harder.
Okay. Come on. Stop it.

27:02.354 --> 27:05.825
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it. Stop. Stop it.
Shut up, you asshole.

27:05.858 --> 27:08.761
What?!
It wasn't cute
when you were 45,

27:08.795 --> 27:10.596
and it sure as hell
isn't cute now.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.631
So stop it.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.668
You know what?
What?

27:15.702 --> 27:18.170
You were never in my corner.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.439
All these years,
you always thought

27:20.472 --> 27:23.509
Davis had more talent
than I did.

27:23.542 --> 27:25.444
She does.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.447
She can act rings around you.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.684
But your ass is nice and your
tits aren't sagging, so...

27:31.718 --> 27:33.652
Get out of my house.
Okay.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.790
You don't want to do
this tour, that's fine.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.993
But when those nominations
come out, I want you

27:41.027 --> 27:43.395
to be shaking hands
and sucking cocks,

27:43.429 --> 27:45.331
even if you yourself
are not nominated.

27:45.364 --> 27:46.899
Every statue
that this picture wins

27:46.933 --> 27:49.902
brings another million dollars
into our pockets.

27:49.936 --> 27:53.039
And you have a piece
of the picture.

27:53.072 --> 27:56.175
It is your goddamn
fiduciary responsibility.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.576
(sighs)

27:57.609 --> 28:00.012
Asshole!
(door opens)

28:00.046 --> 28:02.014
OLIVIA: Poor Joan.
(door closes)

28:02.048 --> 28:04.917
I sometimes feel that
she had more trouble

28:04.951 --> 28:08.821
dealing with success
than she did failure.

28:08.855 --> 28:13.325
Bette, on the other hand, well,
she hadn't had a hit in years.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.061
After all that time
in the desert,

28:15.094 --> 28:18.564
she wasn't about to let this one
go without enjoying it.

28:18.597 --> 28:20.599
(crowd cheering,
Bette speaks indistinctly)

28:25.471 --> 28:27.273
MAN: Hey, Bette!
Where's your sister?

28:27.306 --> 28:28.775
Where's Joan Crawford?

28:28.808 --> 28:31.377
On the beach. Dead!

28:31.410 --> 28:33.379
(laughter)

28:33.412 --> 28:36.248
OLIVIA: For the first time ever,
Bette seemed to enjoy

28:36.282 --> 28:38.250
her public;
she seemed to embrace

28:38.284 --> 28:40.252
the idea of being a star.

28:40.286 --> 28:43.856
And she was gonna hold on
to that feeling for dear life,

28:43.890 --> 28:45.758
because she knew
it might never come again.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.293
JACK PAAR:
So what's it like

28:47.326 --> 28:49.261
to be the cat's pajamas?

28:49.295 --> 28:50.729
(laughter)

28:50.763 --> 28:53.565
Is that what the kids
are calling it now?

28:53.599 --> 28:56.268
I hear that you and your costar
are more popular

28:56.302 --> 28:59.071
with the Brylcreem
and acne set than Fabian.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.472
If that's so,

29:00.506 --> 29:02.909
I would suggest they
send all their fan mail

29:02.942 --> 29:04.410
to Mr. Jack Warner,

29:04.443 --> 29:05.945
care of Warner Brothers
Studios.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.114
He didn't want to make
this picture, you know.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.316
You know what
his initial reaction was?

29:10.349 --> 29:11.450
No, what?

29:11.483 --> 29:13.319
He said he wouldn't
put up a nickel

29:13.352 --> 29:15.587
for us "two old broads."
No.

29:15.621 --> 29:16.588
(laughter)
BETTE: Yes. Can you imagine?

29:16.622 --> 29:17.589
I mean, really.

29:17.623 --> 29:18.991
I guess we showed him there's

29:19.025 --> 29:22.328
still a lot of life left
in these two old broads.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.996
(laughs)
(laughter, applause)

29:28.167 --> 29:30.169
(phone ringing)

29:33.372 --> 29:34.740
Hello?

29:34.773 --> 29:37.944
Hello?

29:37.977 --> 29:39.912
Oh.

29:39.946 --> 29:43.349
So you finally deigned
to pick up, huh?

29:43.382 --> 29:45.117
I had just walked in the-- Joan?

29:45.151 --> 29:46.352
Please stop

29:46.385 --> 29:50.189
referring to me as an old broad,

29:50.222 --> 29:51.958
or I'll have to consult
my lawyer.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.125
It's slander.

29:53.159 --> 29:56.295
And it impairs my ability to

29:56.328 --> 29:58.130
secure future work.

29:58.164 --> 30:02.468
The only thing impairing your
ability is a fifth of vodka.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.470
This is sad, Joan.
I'm sad for you.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.338
For me?
BETTE: Yes.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.774
Jesus Christ,
we're a goddamned bona fide hit,

30:08.807 --> 30:11.110
and you're incapable
of enjoying it.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.445
Well, it looks like you've been
enjoying it enough for

30:13.479 --> 30:14.613
the both of us.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.883
Half the success belongs to you.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.951
Well, then I'd appreciate it

30:18.985 --> 30:21.954
if you would enjoy it
half as much.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.523
(line clicks, dial tone hums)

30:24.556 --> 30:26.558
(sighs)

30:31.097 --> 30:33.332
Pathetic old drunk.

30:58.290 --> 31:01.693
Sinatra's comedic contributions
to the Western.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.762
He wants to rewrite
half of my goddamn lines.

31:03.795 --> 31:04.997
Well, maybe you got

31:05.031 --> 31:06.933
to snap your fingers
to get the jokes.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.935
Oh, I hope his limo
gets lost in the Mojave.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.370
Take a break.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.546
"The Black Slipper."

31:20.579 --> 31:22.448
I wrote it for Joan.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.716
When the hell did you find
the time to do that?

31:24.750 --> 31:27.453
Well, if it's something
you care about,

31:27.486 --> 31:29.121
you get up early, right?

31:29.155 --> 31:30.456
I didn't know you were a writer.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.790
I'm also a director.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.526
At least, I think I am.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.761
No, I-I am.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.896
Uh, Pauline, I'm lost.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.899
I wrote it to give myself
a picture to direct, Bob.

31:40.933 --> 31:43.069
You said you
couldn't have done

31:43.102 --> 31:44.370
Baby Jane without me.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.105
That is what you said.
Well, I know how to cast,

31:46.138 --> 31:48.074
I know how to prep, I know
how to handle the studio.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.108
And I am good.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.943
I've been there
every day.

31:50.977 --> 31:54.046
I've managed more disasters than
the Army Corps of Engineers.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.747
Of course, I realize
there are things

31:55.781 --> 31:57.950
that I do need to learn
about the camera...

31:57.984 --> 32:00.552
Easy, partner.
You don't have to convince me.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.888
You're good on story.
You have an impeccable eye.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.556
And you handled
those two old broads

32:04.590 --> 32:05.791
like a lion tamer.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.659
Thank you.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.096
Anything else you can
pick up in a textbook.

32:10.129 --> 32:12.098
So then you will read it

32:12.131 --> 32:13.565
and you would consider
producing?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.634
(chuckles)
Why do you sound so surprised?

32:15.667 --> 32:18.137
Because some men
find it off-putting,

32:18.170 --> 32:20.406
imagining a woman in charge.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.641
Really? What men?

32:22.674 --> 32:24.676
Oh, your friends
at the old folks' home?

32:26.045 --> 32:27.579
It's a new world, Pauline.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.282
Thank you, Bob.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.918
I will not forget this.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.587
Well, since
you're in charge now,

32:35.621 --> 32:37.323
why don't I let you

32:37.356 --> 32:40.859
tell Sinatra
where he can put this?

32:40.892 --> 32:43.095
(sighs)

32:43.129 --> 32:44.663
Boss.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.106
You don't trust women
very much, do you?

32:54.140 --> 32:55.941
Why don't you
trust people?!

32:55.974 --> 32:58.477
No, no! Go back to
your-your fancy party!

32:58.510 --> 33:00.446
I don't need you!
Go on! Get out!

33:00.479 --> 33:02.281
(keys jangling)

33:02.314 --> 33:04.883
It's all right, Sergeant.

33:04.916 --> 33:07.186
I think I just lost a client,
that's all.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.788
Good night, toughy.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.290
DIRECTOR: And cut!
(bell rings)

33:11.323 --> 33:12.624
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
Okay, that's lunch!

33:12.658 --> 33:13.792
One hour!
Cigarette?

33:13.825 --> 33:15.361
Thank you.
What a gentleman.

33:15.394 --> 33:17.363
I liked that. How did you
think it went? Are you happy?

33:17.396 --> 33:19.665
MICHAEL PARKS: I am happy.
Mm.

33:19.698 --> 33:24.536
What is this big fish
doing in my little pond?

33:24.570 --> 33:27.206
Bette, how you doing?
I'm doing television.

33:27.239 --> 33:30.542
I want you to take me out to
a fancy, expensive restaurant.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.178
You got it.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.012
I want you to have this.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.814
Open it.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.549
(box rattles)

33:37.583 --> 33:39.351
(chuckles)

33:39.385 --> 33:43.089
It's the one millionth
ticket sold for Baby Jane,

33:43.122 --> 33:44.723
or that's what
they told me.

33:44.756 --> 33:48.194
Oh, how nice. I hope
I don't have to pawn it.

33:48.227 --> 33:49.661
Yeah. I saw
your Variety ad.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.097
Oh, that was just a joke.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.998
Yeah, I know that's how
people are taking it,

33:53.031 --> 33:54.866
but I know better.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.602
All right, I admit,
I was in a panic.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.437
Everyone thought Baby Jane
was going to bomb.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.406
And it didn't.
No, it didn't.

34:00.439 --> 34:03.242
And I'm still not
getting any offers.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.177
What are you talking about?
You're doing Perry Mason.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.212
It's television.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.713
There's no shame
in doing television.

34:07.746 --> 34:10.015
Says the man who just signed
Sinatra and Dean Martin

34:10.048 --> 34:12.518
to a multimillion-dollar
Western romp.

34:12.551 --> 34:13.952
Yeah, you're right.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.687
It's disgraceful
how you and Joan

34:15.721 --> 34:17.789
aren't getting the credit
you deserve.

34:17.823 --> 34:20.526
You should both be
up to your necks in offers.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.695
Well, this town has always
been a boys' club,

34:23.729 --> 34:25.531
and the boys are not polite.

34:25.564 --> 34:28.200
They're not going to hold
the door open for me.

34:28.234 --> 34:29.801
I'm gonna have to kick it open,
the way I always have.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.637
(chuckles)

34:33.172 --> 34:35.040
I found a script.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.942
I want you to direct.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.146
It's about two sisters...

34:40.179 --> 34:42.148
Bette, no, I'm not going
another 12 rounds with you two.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.816
(laughs) Crawford's not getting
anywhere near this one.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.485
So who do you see
for your costar?

34:46.518 --> 34:48.120
Me.

34:48.154 --> 34:50.656
I play both parts.
They're twins.

34:50.689 --> 34:52.791
Didn't you do that already?
'46. A Stolen Life.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.626
But the technology
has so improved.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.228
And so have I.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.796
We shouldn't be repeating
ourselves, Bette.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.831
I don't think that's a good move
for either of us.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.804
I understand. Completely.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.407
Don't give it
a second thought.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.142
I'm really pleased for you, Bob,

35:10.176 --> 35:11.810
that you've turned
everything around,

35:11.843 --> 35:13.312
and I'm so happy

35:13.345 --> 35:17.082
that someone is getting credit
for our success.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.452
And now you can
go off and make

35:20.486 --> 35:23.489
a big Western with the boys.

35:23.522 --> 35:26.758
And I have my little ashtray.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.161
Oh, come on, Bette. You're
gonna get more than an ashtray.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.363
We both know you're gonna be
nominated for another Oscar.

35:31.397 --> 35:32.698
What if I lose?

35:32.731 --> 35:34.065
You won't lose.

35:35.367 --> 35:38.103
A nomination
is not gonna be enough

35:38.136 --> 35:39.938
to turn this around for me, Bob.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.441
I've just proven that
I can still open a picture.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.444
If the offers
aren't coming in now...

35:45.477 --> 35:47.213
Yeah, but they
will come in.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.215
And if they don't,
I promise you,

35:49.248 --> 35:52.184
I will personally write you
another big fat fucking hit.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.119
Yeah.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.954
That's what Mankiewicz
said, too,

35:55.987 --> 35:58.390
right after I lost
for All About Eve.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.394
I'm still waiting.

36:17.276 --> 36:18.744
(whispers):
Wait.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.112
That's it.
Oh, wow!

36:22.548 --> 36:24.082
Frank,

36:24.115 --> 36:25.984
some of these costuming ideas,
I don't think

36:26.017 --> 36:28.086
they're very practical
in this context.

36:28.119 --> 36:31.257
You got cream suede boots,
uh, linen pants, gold ascot...

36:31.290 --> 36:32.824
Gold silk ascot.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.693
Yeah, well, yeah,
a top hat and tux

36:34.726 --> 36:36.862
for the act three brawl--
I mean, come on,

36:36.895 --> 36:38.597
this is the Wild West,
it's Galveston.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.566
(chuckles) You know,
I mean, think of the dust.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.934
There's chaw spit flying
all over the place.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.936
I mean, there's horseshit
on the streets.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.772
Zack Thomas doesn't
walk in horseshit.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.874
Yeah, and what about,
look, page 33.

36:48.907 --> 36:52.411
You got Fifi shining your shoes,
and you want Anita Ekberg

36:52.444 --> 36:53.712
to give you a shave on page 108?

36:53.745 --> 36:56.415
Bob... go to the club
and get a drink.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.617
I hear a heart attack coming on.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.687
Zack Thomas is intent

37:01.720 --> 37:05.291
on recouping his $100,000
from Joe Jarrett.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.725
That is the picture.

37:06.758 --> 37:09.461
Now, if every time we see Zack,
he's getting a foot rub,

37:09.495 --> 37:11.597
how's the audience gonna
understand his ambition?

37:11.630 --> 37:13.098
People know what I want,

37:13.131 --> 37:15.133
and they know
I don't sweat gettin' it.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.902
Match me.

37:28.647 --> 37:29.948
VICTOR:
Zack,

37:29.981 --> 37:31.383
what are we gonna
do about Jarrett

37:31.417 --> 37:32.551
and his gambling boat now?

37:32.584 --> 37:34.386
Well, you don't leave me
much choice.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.788
He now has the dock rights,
thanks to you.

37:36.822 --> 37:38.490
But don't worry
about it, Harv,

37:38.524 --> 37:40.759
opening night
will be closing night.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.894
Certainly hope so.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.597
Sometimes think I don't have
the intestinal fortitude

37:45.631 --> 37:47.899
for this job.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.168
The word is "guts," Harv.

37:50.201 --> 37:51.837
ROBERT:
Cut, cut.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.405
Frank, you're looking
straight down the camera.

37:53.439 --> 37:54.940
I'm pretending it's a mirror.
Well, that's fine,

37:54.973 --> 37:57.576
but just look to one side.
No.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.178
You go see a Sinatra comedy,
you want to see his baby blues.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.314
You're not Sinatra, you're
Zack Thomas, and this isn't

38:02.348 --> 38:03.915
center stage
at the Sands.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.184
It's a saloon
in Galveston.

38:06.217 --> 38:09.455
Frank, listen, we have an
opportunity here to make

38:09.488 --> 38:11.189
a picture
that's saying something

38:11.222 --> 38:14.159
about the rivalry and greed that
civilized the American West.

38:14.192 --> 38:15.627
It's saying nothing
but tits and fistfights

38:15.661 --> 38:17.429
and me looking like
a real cool daddy.

38:17.463 --> 38:19.030
Come on!
Okay, okay.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.999
I'm not gonna argue with you.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.602
Let's go back to, uh, um, "You
don't leave me much choice."

38:23.635 --> 38:25.270
Got it.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.539
Okay, let's roll.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.375
Rolling.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.446
And... action.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.215
(burps quietly)

38:37.248 --> 38:38.884
How can I concentrate

38:38.917 --> 38:40.952
with this beluga whale
belching next to me?

38:40.986 --> 38:42.954
Oh, that's... it's
a character choice,

38:42.988 --> 38:44.656
Mr. Sinatra.
Who asked you?! Huh?

38:44.690 --> 38:46.124
Okay, come on,
come on.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.026
Let's concentrate.
Let's go again.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.028
We're still rolling.
Come on.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.463
(clears throat)

38:51.497 --> 38:54.500
Okay, going again.
And... action.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.904
ADELL: "You don't
leave me much choice."
I know the line,

38:58.937 --> 39:01.473
you stupid bitch!
ROBERT: All right, all right,
that's out of bounds.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.041
Out of bounds?!

39:03.074 --> 39:05.043
Who the fuck do you think
you are, out of bounds?!

39:05.076 --> 39:06.344
You're nobody.

39:06.378 --> 39:08.380
I ought to have you
decapitated and buried

39:08.414 --> 39:10.982
in the fucking desert,
you sweaty, four-eyed ape.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.184
They won't even mark
your grave with an "X."

39:13.218 --> 39:15.253
And no one'll notice
you're gone!

39:21.259 --> 39:23.762
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
And that's lunch!

39:23.795 --> 39:25.531
One hour!
(bell rings)

39:26.565 --> 39:28.366
Warner wants to see you.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.569
Yeah, why does that sound
like a relief?

39:30.602 --> 39:32.003
(sighs)

39:32.037 --> 39:33.905
Here. Sinatra's changes.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.941
Just put them
in some kind of order.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.545
I'm sorry, honey.
You okay?

39:39.578 --> 39:41.012
Yeah.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.948
(typewriter clacking)

39:44.450 --> 39:45.417
(Robert clears throat)

39:45.451 --> 39:46.418
(bell dings)

39:46.452 --> 39:48.086
Couch.

39:52.257 --> 39:54.225
Don't be nervous, Bob.

39:54.259 --> 39:55.794
I asked you here

39:55.827 --> 39:57.463
because...

39:57.496 --> 40:00.098
I didn't like the way
we left things last time.

40:00.131 --> 40:02.267
I wanted to apologize

40:02.300 --> 40:04.235
for my harsh and
insulting language.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.037
I'm sorry.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.373
I was hurt,
I felt rejected,

40:08.406 --> 40:10.041
and I lashed out.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.610
It's all right.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.311
No. It's not.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.614
Just because I
made Bob Aldrich

40:15.647 --> 40:18.617
doesn't mean that he has
to obey my every command.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.752
You're not a poodle.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.087
Are you, Bob?

40:22.120 --> 40:23.589
You're your own man.

40:24.823 --> 40:27.258
Well, thanks for that.
I appreciate it.

40:27.292 --> 40:29.427
Well, I hope we can
still be friends.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.597
Yeah, sure. Why not?

40:33.465 --> 40:35.266
So...

40:35.300 --> 40:37.402
I hear the Sinatra
dailies are unwatchable.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.770
Uh, we'll get there.

40:38.804 --> 40:40.138
Yeah?

40:40.171 --> 40:41.973
I also hear
that he's treating you

40:42.007 --> 40:44.075
like a halfwit toilet attendant.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.144
Well, I wouldn't say we've, uh,

40:46.177 --> 40:48.580
we've hit a groove
of mutual respect. (chuckles)

40:48.614 --> 40:50.081
Come on, Bobby.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.617
You can't hide from old Jack.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.318
I can hear it in your voice.

40:53.351 --> 40:54.986
Your sphincter's clenching up.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.788
Which is exactly what
I told you would happen.

40:56.822 --> 40:58.123
I know you're getting

40:58.156 --> 41:00.425
some kind of grim
satisfaction out of this,

41:00.458 --> 41:01.860
but I slaved over that script.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.194
I slaved over it.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.530
And this...

41:04.563 --> 41:07.098
suntanned man-child
is mutilating it.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.534
Yeah. Yeah.

41:08.567 --> 41:11.603
No, I've-I've heard.
I've heard.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.505
What's this?

41:13.539 --> 41:16.141
That's a gift
for my good friend Bob.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.442
Fresh, un-mutilated properties.

41:17.475 --> 41:20.679
Further tales
of old hags.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.881
No, no, no.
Now, listen.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.883
Pick one, bring it to Bette.

41:24.916 --> 41:27.285
As a bonus,
I will release

41:27.318 --> 41:29.555
your dog-shit Sinatra Western.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.590
Who else would do that for you?

41:33.892 --> 41:35.393
All right, come on.

41:35.426 --> 41:37.395
Run along, now.
I got writing to do.

41:37.428 --> 41:39.731
I'm working on my
autobiography.

41:39.765 --> 41:41.332
What do you think
I should call it?

41:41.366 --> 41:43.468
I'm thinking of
Life of a Showman.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.737
Yeah, that's great. Mm-hmm.
That's good,
right? Yeah.

41:45.771 --> 41:48.740
Oh, also, good
luck on Monday.

41:48.774 --> 41:50.709
I mean, in general,
for Baby Jane.

41:50.742 --> 41:54.212
It's sure to pick up a few nods,
but I want you to be prepared

41:54.245 --> 41:56.314
for the possibility
that you'll be left out.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.316
But don't take it
personally.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.586
You're just not the type that
your peer group acknowledges.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.089
I'll see you later.

42:04.122 --> 42:06.491
Can I ask you
something, Jack?

42:06.524 --> 42:08.026
Yes, of course.

42:08.059 --> 42:09.695
Be straight with me.

42:09.728 --> 42:12.831
Never any other
way, Bob.

42:12.864 --> 42:16.267
Do you think I have
the potential for greatness?

42:17.435 --> 42:18.737
(knocks on desk)

42:18.770 --> 42:20.205
No.

42:27.445 --> 42:28.814
(sighs)

42:30.749 --> 42:32.050
(sighs)

42:34.886 --> 42:36.421
Honey, get Frank.

42:36.454 --> 42:38.690
He took a jet
to New York, Pop.

42:38.724 --> 42:39.858
What?

42:39.891 --> 42:41.893
H-He said to
shoot around him.

42:49.801 --> 42:51.903
What is this, Bob?

42:51.937 --> 42:53.404
Sinatra's notes,
which I invite you

42:53.438 --> 42:54.973
to stuff into
a Molotov cocktail.

42:55.006 --> 42:56.541
No, this was my script.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.443
I worked on this
for months,

42:58.476 --> 43:00.779
and you used it for scrap paper.

43:00.812 --> 43:02.380
You even read it?

43:02.413 --> 43:03.915
Well, I-I needed something
to write on, Pauline.

43:03.949 --> 43:05.617
It's not like I tossed it out.

43:05.651 --> 43:08.620
No, you just told me to "stuff
it into a Molotov cocktail."

43:08.654 --> 43:09.788
Pauline!

43:11.189 --> 43:13.625
I'm drowning here.
I'm underwater.

43:13.659 --> 43:16.061
And you're asking me
to move a mountain for you.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.329
Even if you didn't pick
the shittiest time possible,

43:18.363 --> 43:20.398
I'm not a miracle worker.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.067
No one is gonna let
a woman direct a picture.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.735
You're in fantasyland.

43:23.769 --> 43:26.337
Now, if you want to come back
to the real world

43:26.371 --> 43:28.139
and keep working for me
as my assistant, good.

43:28.173 --> 43:29.340
If not, take a walk.

43:29.374 --> 43:31.409
Because I don't have
time or energy

43:31.442 --> 43:34.646
to coddle a middle-aged
boy singer and you, too!

43:38.850 --> 43:40.852
*

43:54.733 --> 43:56.467
MAMACITA:
One slice each--

43:56.501 --> 43:58.670
apple, pecan
and whipped cream.

43:58.704 --> 44:00.205
With two Pepsi-Colas.

44:00.238 --> 44:03.341
Well, no time like the present
to develop diabetes.

44:03.374 --> 44:04.976
Miss Joan forbids sweets.

44:05.010 --> 44:07.178
She says sugar is
a dangerous food.

44:07.212 --> 44:09.614
I take my thrills where I can.

44:09.647 --> 44:10.982
Bring the
bill to me.

44:11.016 --> 44:12.617
You don't have
to treat, Mamacita.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.920
I don't need consolation.

44:16.688 --> 44:20.726
My mother wasted her entire life
bringing us pot roasts on trays

44:20.759 --> 44:22.861
and ironing
my father's boxer shorts.

44:22.894 --> 44:25.130
Not that there's anything wrong
with domestic work.

44:25.163 --> 44:28.800
I only mean that...
Joan is right.

44:28.834 --> 44:31.469
I've got a good thing
going with Bob.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.404
I can't throw it away
on a pipe dream.

44:33.438 --> 44:35.206
I've got to live
in the real world.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.508
But the real world is changing.

44:37.542 --> 44:40.511
Mornings when Miss Joan
has a hangover,

44:40.545 --> 44:42.213
I take the twins to the library.

44:42.247 --> 44:43.681
I'm a new citizen.

44:43.715 --> 44:45.984
I learn about my country
in the Reference Room.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.386
I read the Almanac,
the Atlas,

44:48.419 --> 44:50.355
the Census Report.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.824
You didn't tear these
out of a library book, did you?

44:52.858 --> 44:54.893
This is
the United States sex ratio.

44:54.926 --> 44:59.164
Look here. In 1910, there are
how many more men than women?

44:59.197 --> 45:00.165
2.7 million.

45:00.198 --> 45:01.332
In 1940?

45:01.366 --> 45:03.334
Zero-point-five.

45:03.368 --> 45:06.905
And now we outnumber them
by more than one million.

45:06.938 --> 45:09.941
Mm-hmm. Should someone tell
the men they're going extinct?

45:09.975 --> 45:11.376
Not extinct.

45:11.409 --> 45:13.845
Minority.
Men were first to immigrate.

45:13.879 --> 45:17.015
On frontier, only men,
like bathhouse.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.850
That explains
big 1910 number.

45:18.884 --> 45:20.185
However,

45:20.218 --> 45:23.388
men have shorter lives,
because they are less strong.

45:23.421 --> 45:25.190
And many die in war.

45:25.223 --> 45:26.825
That explains the decline.

45:29.127 --> 45:30.728
Census projections.

45:30.762 --> 45:34.732
By 1970, there will be
six million more women than men.

45:34.766 --> 45:36.601
52% of total population.

45:36.634 --> 45:38.603
Do you know what this means?

45:38.636 --> 45:40.438
A lot of lonely gals.

45:40.471 --> 45:41.973
Studios will have obligations

45:42.007 --> 45:44.142
to make half of stories
about women,

45:44.175 --> 45:46.878
by women, for women.

45:46.912 --> 45:48.947
It only makes economic sense.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.749
Keep your head up.

45:51.783 --> 45:54.019
Your day is coming.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.490
Mamacita.

46:01.526 --> 46:04.429
You're a real
big-picture thinker.

46:10.168 --> 46:12.537
(phone line beeping)

46:14.339 --> 46:16.341
(beeping continues)

46:28.119 --> 46:30.355
(dial tone humming)

46:46.872 --> 46:49.841
(phone line beeping in distance)

46:49.875 --> 46:51.642
Mamacita?

46:51.676 --> 46:53.644
(beeping phone line
grows louder)

46:58.216 --> 47:00.651

47:30.048 --> 47:31.883
(beeping continues)

47:34.519 --> 47:36.988
Hmm.

47:37.022 --> 47:38.423
MAMACITA: Miss Joan.
(gasps) Oh.

47:38.456 --> 47:39.891
(phone clatters)

47:39.925 --> 47:42.994
Oh, you startled me, Mamacita.

47:43.028 --> 47:46.831
What's going on?
I asked you to wake me at 5:30.

47:46.864 --> 47:50.668
They're announcing
the Oscar nominations today.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.037
Miss Joan.

47:53.738 --> 47:55.806
I want you to sit down.

47:59.044 --> 48:01.346

49:37.742 --> 49:40.778
Lose the shoulder pads
and cut back on the lipstick.

49:40.811 --> 49:44.649
You're playing a recluse
who hasn't seen the sun
for 20 years, for Christ's sake.

49:44.682 --> 49:48.886
Poor Bette.
So dreadfully overweight.

Don't touch me!

50:17.582 --> 50:19.317
Legion.

Nobody knows
who anybody works for.

Do you know
who I work for?

50:32.097 --> 50:34.232
And I trust you know
who I am?

50:34.265 --> 50:36.867
Do you know
whose truck this is?
