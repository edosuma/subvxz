WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.177
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right,
let's start with the good news.

00:03.220 --> 00:07.050
Jane and Rafael
were together and happy.

00:07.094 --> 00:10.271
Also happy?
Petra and her lawyer, J.R.

00:10.314 --> 00:12.055
Mmm, baby.

00:12.099 --> 00:14.884
Oh, and speaking of Baby,
remember this?

00:14.927 --> 00:17.756
We have finally found
the perfect nanny.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.106
DARCI:
Felicia Romero.

00:19.149 --> 00:20.498
I have a better idea.

00:21.717 --> 00:24.024
A baby needs her father,
which is why

00:24.067 --> 00:25.416
I will take the next year off.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.722
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Only problem?

00:26.765 --> 00:28.158
He's not going to stay home
much longer

00:28.202 --> 00:29.855
because his American version

00:29.899 --> 00:31.683
ofThe Passions of Santos
just got the green light.

00:31.727 --> 00:32.902
We are officially going to make

00:32.945 --> 00:35.209
The Passions
of Steve and Brenda:

00:35.252 --> 00:39.082
The First Co-Presidents
of the United States.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.084
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, and
speaking of the United States,

00:41.128 --> 00:44.044
you recall Alba's been
on the path to citizenship,

00:44.087 --> 00:45.697
and she's also had to deal
with some romantic drama

00:45.741 --> 00:47.177
of her own.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.309
See, Jorge proposed,

00:48.352 --> 00:50.702
but she turned him down...
twice.

00:50.746 --> 00:53.923
And then she changed her mind,
but it was too late.

00:55.794 --> 00:58.232
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know. Talk about heartbreak.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.364
Which brings us to Xiomara.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.714
See, she recently learned she
has stage III breast cancer,

01:02.758 --> 01:05.804
so she had to make
some big decisions.

01:05.848 --> 01:08.677
I've actually decided
to have a single mastectomy.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.723
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so she had the surgery,

01:11.767 --> 01:12.985
which, my friends,

01:13.029 --> 01:15.858
is where we left off.

01:15.901 --> 01:19.862
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was 18 years old,

01:19.905 --> 01:22.517
something truly horrific
happened.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.437
ALL:
No!

01:29.480 --> 01:31.395
She missed Arturo finding out

01:31.439 --> 01:33.571
that his bride Victoria
was actually

01:33.615 --> 01:35.573
his long-lost sister
onTe Amo Pero Te Odio.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.184
All right, that's it.

01:37.227 --> 01:38.620
No more putting it off.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.143
We're getting a new TV.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.318
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And that, friends,

01:41.362 --> 01:42.711
was when the Villanueva women

01:42.754 --> 01:45.235
got to work.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.976
And, as with all families,

01:47.019 --> 01:48.717
each had a part to play.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.762
Okay, I've narrowed it down
to three choices

01:50.806 --> 01:52.721
based off price, size,
and picture quality.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.418
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Jane was the researcher.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.642
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Alba was the caretaker.

02:00.685 --> 02:03.384
Okay, I will, but look.
This is my top choice,

02:03.427 --> 02:04.994
and normally
it's out of our price range,

02:05.037 --> 02:08.171
but I found a coupon
in the paper for 25% off.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.477
[gasps]Mmm.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.087
Oh, my God. It expires today.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.523
And the store closes
at 6:00 p.m.

02:12.567 --> 02:15.222
What?It's 5:45. Let's go!

02:15.265 --> 02:16.527
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And Xo...

02:16.571 --> 02:17.702
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

02:17.746 --> 02:19.226
It's 5:58!

02:19.269 --> 02:21.315
Oh, sorry. We're closed.
Come back tomorrow.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.578
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, she was the whoop ass.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.319
Oh, hell no, junior.

02:25.362 --> 02:26.668
We have 90 seconds left,

02:26.711 --> 02:28.017
so unless you want your boss

02:28.060 --> 02:29.453
to know that you closed early,

02:29.497 --> 02:32.326
punch back in
or I'll punch you out.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.676
[sighs]

02:34.719 --> 02:37.505
ROGELIO:
I got the new TV.

02:37.548 --> 02:39.333
Full price.

02:39.376 --> 02:40.899
I made sure to get a good one.

02:40.943 --> 02:43.337
None of that discounted crap.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.903
My only request

02:44.947 --> 02:47.645
is that you never watch my shows
in ultra-high-def.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.343
It is not a fair depiction

02:49.386 --> 02:50.996
of my pore size.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.347
You have my word. Thanks, hon.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.479
[Baby crying]Baby duty calls.

02:55.523 --> 02:56.741
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yep.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.395
In times of crisis, we revert

02:58.439 --> 03:00.484
to our roles.Cool TV.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.399
Can I watch PAW Patrol
with Abuela?

03:09.406 --> 03:11.408
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yep, there's our caretaker.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.289
Yes to fluids, no to plastic.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.508
Use this, Mateo.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.858
I have to send you
guys this article.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.599
It's really interesting.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.384
Basically,
plastic is poisoning us all.

03:30.427 --> 03:31.863
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
What'd I tell you?

03:31.907 --> 03:33.952
The researcher.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.609
[sighs]

03:42.004 --> 03:43.353
I don't know, Ma.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.789
Just walking around the house
feels like enough.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.183
I'm still in so much pain.ROGELIO: No!

03:47.227 --> 03:48.445
Sheila,

03:48.489 --> 03:50.491
Santos never wears peach.

03:50.534 --> 03:51.970
Never ever.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.059
Even if he was playing a peach,
he would wear lavender.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.801
He would be a lavender peach.

03:56.845 --> 03:59.543
Do you understand? Okay.

03:59.587 --> 04:01.197
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.981
They just hired the
new costume designer

04:03.025 --> 04:04.853
for Steve and Brenda,
and she's clueless.

04:04.896 --> 04:06.333
Even Baby knows

04:06.376 --> 04:08.291
that President
Steven T. Santos

04:08.335 --> 04:10.685
doesn't wear peach.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.295
How are you
and Darci doing

04:12.339 --> 04:13.557
on the search
for a new nanny?

04:15.080 --> 04:16.125
You haven't told her?

04:16.168 --> 04:17.344
Dad.Rogelio.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.171
I know, I know, but I
made such a big show

04:19.215 --> 04:20.695
about being Baby's nanny,

04:20.738 --> 04:22.349
Darci will rake me over
the coals for backing out.

04:22.392 --> 04:24.307
So I was thinking,

04:24.351 --> 04:26.962
maybe I could bring Baby
with me to work.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.616
You know,

04:28.659 --> 04:29.878
just hand her to a P.A.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.619
when we roll camera.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.142
Rogelio, that's ridiculous.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.317
You have to talk to Darci.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.840
Well...Now!

04:35.884 --> 04:37.494
Don't be a coward.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.322
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yep, there's our whoop ass.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.584
Oh, here's the article.

04:40.628 --> 04:43.152
So, it's not just BPA,
although that's bad.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.849
It... uh...

04:44.893 --> 04:47.025
My computer died.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.331
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Thank God. [sighs]

04:48.375 --> 04:50.855
I think I left my charger
at Rafael's.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.161
It's over there
in the kitchen pile.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.510
Or maybe it's
by the bed pile.

04:53.554 --> 04:54.685
There are a lot of Jane piles

04:54.729 --> 04:56.034
in this place.Got it.

04:56.078 --> 04:57.949
Well, where are you guys headed?

04:57.993 --> 04:59.603
I got called in early
for a shift,

04:59.647 --> 05:01.518
so I'm dropping them off
at Petra's.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.215
Hey, how's your mom?

05:03.259 --> 05:06.044
Took a few more laps
around the living room today.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.350
Nice.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.091
Oh, want some more good news?

05:09.134 --> 05:10.614
Always.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.660
Mateo's progress report.

05:12.703 --> 05:15.184
Straight fours.What?!

05:15.227 --> 05:16.577
Mateo! That's my boy.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.276
ELLIE: We used to think
four was good, too.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.886
But that's when we thought
it was out of five.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.105
It's out of six.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.194
ELLIE:
So it's more of a C-plus.

05:25.237 --> 05:27.022
We got A's.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.719
Well, I am still
very proud of him.

05:28.763 --> 05:31.026
[chuckles, clicks tongue]
And the two of you

05:31.069 --> 05:32.375
for being such little...

05:32.419 --> 05:33.942
smarties.

05:33.985 --> 05:36.205
Should we go out and celebrate?Yeah.

05:36.248 --> 05:37.380
Can we go bowling?

05:37.424 --> 05:38.686
Of course. Bowling it is.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.383
[chuckles]

05:40.427 --> 05:42.037
Oh!

05:42.080 --> 05:43.430
My charger. Okay.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.606
I have to get back to my mom's.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.085
See you later. I love you.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.436
Whoa.

05:49.479 --> 05:52.047
Did you actually just say that?

05:52.090 --> 05:54.571
Yeah, I guess I did.

05:54.615 --> 05:57.095
Well, I love you, too.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.533
[chuckles softly] Aw.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.491
Okay, got to go.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.014
Us, too.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.625
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Seriously? Wow.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.235
Talk about anticlimactic.

06:06.278 --> 06:07.932
[door closes]

06:07.976 --> 06:09.978
OMG, I'm sorry.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.502
It was so anticlimactic,
I forgot to do this.

06:21.119 --> 06:23.426
[knocking]

06:23.470 --> 06:26.255
[clears throat]

06:26.298 --> 06:28.257
You're early.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.041
My shift changed.
I've been texting you.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.522
Oh, and before I forget,

06:32.566 --> 06:34.568
Jane planned a family
bowling night for Friday

06:34.611 --> 06:36.221
in honor of everyone's good
progress reports at school.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.658
We'll bowl. Uh, listen,

06:37.701 --> 06:39.181
I need you
to keep the girls occupied.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.443
What? Why?

06:40.487 --> 06:41.792
J.R. spent the night.
She's in the shower.

06:41.836 --> 06:42.924
Have the girls even met her yet?

06:42.967 --> 06:44.360
No. And I don't think

06:44.404 --> 06:46.231
now is the ideal time,
but you're early.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.932
Who wants to go downstairs
and get some ice cream?

06:50.975 --> 06:53.108
BOTH: Yay!RAMOS: Okay, love your shower,

06:53.151 --> 06:55.066
hate your...

06:56.241 --> 06:57.460
Oh.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.896
Who is she?

06:58.940 --> 07:00.376
My friend.Why is your friend

07:00.420 --> 07:01.551
wearing a robe?

07:01.595 --> 07:02.552
PETRA: Girls, let's go
for that ice cream.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.033
We'll have a nice talk.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.861
I'm sorry about this.[door closes]

07:06.904 --> 07:08.689
I'm sure it's not how
you wanted to meet the girls.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.517
Yeah, I didn't want
to meet them at all.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.735
Excuse me?

07:11.779 --> 07:14.259
Not a kid person.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.525
I'm gonna put some clothes on.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.309
Nice meeting you.

07:20.352 --> 07:22.050
JANE:
Stop it.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.486
Don't rush to judgment.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.835
She said
she didn't like my kids.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.010
Kids in general,

07:26.054 --> 07:27.316
not just yours.

07:27.359 --> 07:28.622
Although they can be tough.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.537
Jane.Just look at it
from her point of view.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.842
She was in a bathrobe.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.235
She wasn't expecting
to see anybody,

07:33.278 --> 07:36.194
and she ended up
meeting the whole family.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.805
You know what?

07:37.848 --> 07:39.894
I'm gonna call Petra
and suggest we all have dinner.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.156
What? No.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.027
Yes. We have a family policy.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.333
J.R. met the kids.

07:44.376 --> 07:45.682
We have to get to know her.

07:45.726 --> 07:48.032
And you have to give her
a chance.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.078
Fine. I'll go to dinner,

07:50.121 --> 07:51.732
but only if you admit
you're really doing this

07:51.775 --> 07:53.255
because you're curious.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.692
So curious.
She makes Petra giggle.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.520
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She
makes her do more than that.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.349
But also,
we have a family policy.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.742
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of family

08:01.785 --> 08:02.830
and policy...

08:02.873 --> 08:04.222
Can you please check again?

08:04.266 --> 08:05.746
There must be some mistake.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.447
Oh.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.058
Okay, yes. I'll be there.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.712
Thank you.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.627
What was that about?

08:20.021 --> 08:22.023
Monday?

08:22.066 --> 08:23.633
That test wasn't supposed to be
for another two months.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.417
I know.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.424
Okay, so ask
to reschedule it.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.784
Okay. I'll help you study.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.089
We'll get it done.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.135
[door closes]

something. It's important.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.848
Let me guess.
You took a personality test,

09:47.891 --> 09:49.632
and it turns out
you're a narcissistic egomaniac

09:49.676 --> 09:51.808

inferiority complex.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.053
[stammers]: An-An-And,
and these flowers--

19:02.097 --> 19:04.230
oh, my God,
they're gorgeous, Darci.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.145
Truly. Thank you.
And we're walking.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.321
I told Ro you guys would
need time to find someone

19:08.364 --> 19:09.757
before the show starts.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.846
What show?

19:11.889 --> 19:15.502
Rogelio didn't mention
anything about a new show.

19:15.545 --> 19:16.851
He said he couldn't
be Baby's nanny

19:16.894 --> 19:18.461
because you have cancer.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.942
ROGELIO:
Well, i-it was

19:20.985 --> 19:25.033
a-a cancer/new show
combination, really.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.513
DARCI:
Wow.

19:26.556 --> 19:30.778
I knew you were
a self-absorbed meat bag.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.954
But using the cancer card?

19:32.997 --> 19:35.086
That is a new low,
even for you.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.479
And you know who
will suffer? Baby.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.394
Because we lost Felicia,

19:38.438 --> 19:40.527
the best nanny out there,
due to you,

19:40.570 --> 19:41.876
and your ego.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.965
PETRA:
Ugh.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.575
I just hate bowling,
that's why I canceled.

19:45.619 --> 19:48.578
We had a plan. Raf said
he confirmed with you.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.014
He did.
I just don't want to go.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.407
[scoffs]
It's gross.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.279
The dirty shoes,
the dirty balls.

19:53.322 --> 19:56.369
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Petra is so over balls.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.545
Look, I already told Mateo
about it, and he's so excited.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.373
Then take him. I'll do
something else with the girls.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.157
But...
Jane! I don't
like bowling.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.506
You're not gonna
bulldoze me into this.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.813
Is this about J.R.?

20:05.856 --> 20:07.162
What? No.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.511
You said bulldoze,
she said bulldoze.

20:08.555 --> 20:09.773
Is that why
you're saying no?

20:09.817 --> 20:11.210
Of course not.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.735
She doesn't like me,
does she?

20:14.778 --> 20:16.867
She likes you fine.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.261
Okay, fine.
She doesn't like you.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.263
It was awkward

20:21.307 --> 20:23.526
because there were so
many topics off-limits.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.615
Look, don't worry about it.
You're just not her cup of tea.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.704
You should take
the afternoon off.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.316
I'm feeling good. I-I can handle
being alone for a while.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.845
Jane can empty my drains, and
Ro's bringing lunch by later.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.368
And, honestly,
I could use some space.

20:44.591 --> 20:45.983
Ma.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.550
I said I don't need any help.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.117
Why don't you go home
for a bit?

20:50.466 --> 20:52.294
There is a need!

20:52.338 --> 20:54.949
You're smothering me and I need
some time without you!

21:12.358 --> 21:15.839
Mateo had a meltdown when
I told him that the girls

21:15.883 --> 21:17.319
aren't coming bowling.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.060
On a scale of one

21:19.103 --> 21:20.888
to decapitating
his Darth Vader doll?

21:20.931 --> 21:23.238
Oh, it was a dark day
for the Empire.
Well,

21:23.282 --> 21:26.023
he sees the girls all the time.
He'll be fine.I know, but still.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.809
This is why I want J.R. to like
me. She's affecting our family.

21:28.852 --> 21:31.725
And we spent a long time
negotiating our parts.

21:31.768 --> 21:33.727
What's wrong?

21:33.770 --> 21:36.512
I was clearing out
some drawers for you,

21:36.556 --> 21:40.168
and I came across the story
you wrote last night.

21:40.211 --> 21:43.345
Oh. I...

21:43.389 --> 21:45.739
I didn't mean for
you to read that.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.393
I didn't plan to.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.395
But you said I inspired you,

21:49.438 --> 21:52.789
so I thought maybe it would be
about us, but it was...

21:52.833 --> 21:55.662
About Michael.
Yeah.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.794
And look, I hate that
it even bothers me this much,

21:57.838 --> 21:59.666
but you had just told me
that you loved me,

21:59.709 --> 22:01.711
and then you got out of bed,
and you wrote about him.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.453
It just made me feel like...

22:05.933 --> 22:07.238
Like what?

22:07.282 --> 22:10.329
You were choosing him
all over again.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.069
Oh.
And I hate

22:12.113 --> 22:13.375
even saying that.

22:13.419 --> 22:14.942
Look, that's not
what it was.

22:14.985 --> 22:18.902
I sat down to write,
and realized...

22:18.946 --> 22:20.991
yesterday was the anniversary
of Michael's death.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.254
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.256
No. No, no, no, no. It's okay.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.084
No. I had no idea. I should have
never even read it.

22:27.128 --> 22:29.783
[ringtone playing]Oh. I...

22:29.826 --> 22:32.568
Hi, Abuela.
Everything okay?

22:32.612 --> 22:33.961
JANE:
You kicked Abuela out?

22:34.004 --> 22:35.528
Look, I didn't want
to hurt her feelings,

22:35.571 --> 22:37.051
but I had to make her leave.

22:37.094 --> 22:39.096
Why?

22:49.280 --> 22:51.239
JANE:
She failed?

22:51.282 --> 22:53.720
She told me that she was doing
well on her practice tests.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.461
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh.

22:55.504 --> 22:58.464
You knew how soon
the test was?

23:00.291 --> 23:01.597
She swore me to secrecy.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.294
She knew that if you knew,

23:03.338 --> 23:05.122
you wouldn't let her
help you recover.

23:05.166 --> 23:08.038
She's right.
She hasto pass that test.

23:08.082 --> 23:09.910
I can't believe
you hid this from me.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.999
I shouldn't have.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.914
And you shouldn't
have asked me to.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.916
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
A family meeting.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.048
Nice idea, Jane. Classic.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.101
I'm through surgery, Ma.
I'm fine.

23:27.144 --> 23:30.147
I am, I promise.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.028
She is?

23:53.040 --> 23:55.129
I have been outside.

23:57.914 --> 24:00.264
Hey, Gary.

24:00.308 --> 24:02.441
Good to see you.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.486
XIOMARA:
I saw him looking at me

24:04.530 --> 24:06.053
like I was a sick person.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.707
And... I don't know.

24:07.750 --> 24:10.187
I-I just can't handle
being seen like that.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.538
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Especially when you're used
to being the whoop ass.

24:15.497 --> 24:19.240
No, I'msorry
I didn't say anything sooner.

24:19.283 --> 24:22.461
Okay, bottom line?

24:22.504 --> 24:25.376
No more secrets,
much more communication.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.291
We have to work together.

24:27.335 --> 24:29.468
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ladies, let's get in formation.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.818
Abuela, I'm going to take charge
of test prep.

24:34.995 --> 24:36.736
Deal.
Okay.

24:36.779 --> 24:38.564
What about me?
Wha-What's my part?

24:38.607 --> 24:40.043
Recovering.

24:40.087 --> 24:41.654
[laughs]

24:41.697 --> 24:42.872
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so, friends,

24:42.916 --> 24:44.047
they played their parts.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.440
How many congressmen
are there

24:45.484 --> 24:46.833
in the House of Representatives,
Abuela?

24:46.876 --> 24:49.009
425?

24:49.052 --> 24:51.228
Close. 435.

24:54.275 --> 24:56.059
Who was the president
during the Great Depression?

24:56.103 --> 24:58.061
Herbert Hoover.
JANE:
There were two.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.541
Hoover and FDR.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.325
Hoover and FDR.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.242
Hoover, FDR.

25:05.286 --> 25:06.548
Who has the right
to veto bills?

25:06.592 --> 25:07.984
The president.

25:08.028 --> 25:10.421
Right. How old do you
have to be to vote?

25:10.465 --> 25:11.901
18.
Right again.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.947
How many U.S.
senators are there?

25:13.990 --> 25:15.557
100.
Correct.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.690
Is Puerto Rico
an American state?

25:17.733 --> 25:19.953
No, it is a commonwealth,

25:19.996 --> 25:22.564
an unincorporated territory.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.700
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Preach!

25:27.743 --> 25:29.571
Maybe don't say that
last part at the exam,

25:29.615 --> 25:31.530
but that's right.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.930
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
It is important to note
that while Rogelio thinks

25:40.974 --> 25:44.325
he's being recognized for
his celebrity, the truth is,

25:44.368 --> 25:47.720
no one likes a grown man
alone at a playground.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.112
Felicia?

25:53.639 --> 25:55.510
My name is
Rogelio de la Vega.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.207
You interviewed
to be a nanny with...

25:57.251 --> 25:59.949
Oh. I have employment
with a lovely family.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.690
I'd be willing
to up the ante.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.387
Shh! Look straight ahead.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.694
Take out your phone,
pretend to talk.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.176
Is this a poaching
situation?

26:09.219 --> 26:11.613
Yes, it is.

26:11.657 --> 26:14.007
NARRATOR: Ooh. Play date
with a dash of espionage.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.965
I'm leaning in.How did you find me?

26:16.009 --> 26:17.837
Deep dive on Instagram.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.143
I'll match whatever your current
employer is paying you.

26:20.187 --> 26:21.841
Stop talking.All right, I'll double it.

26:21.884 --> 26:24.191
You drive a hard bargain,
Felicia.

26:24.234 --> 26:25.801
MAN:
Felicia?

26:25.845 --> 26:27.237
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Mario Lopez!

26:27.281 --> 26:28.499
What's he doing here?

26:28.543 --> 26:31.198
Are you trying
to poach my nanny?

26:41.469 --> 26:44.428
Mario Lopez, you have
my sincerest apologies.

26:44.472 --> 26:45.995
I have the utmost respect

26:46.039 --> 26:48.041
for your entire body
of work-- as an actor,

26:48.084 --> 26:49.216
as a host, and,

26:49.259 --> 26:51.044
well, your actual body,

26:51.087 --> 26:53.394
which is truly a work of art.

26:53.437 --> 26:55.614
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You're tellin' me. You were poaching.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.573
Everyone knows there's no
poaching on the playground.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.273
I saw on Instagram
you love babies.

27:03.317 --> 27:06.015
Mine is six months old. His kids
are practically in college.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.669
They're four
and six years old,

27:07.713 --> 27:09.802
and Felicia's already
bonded with them.

27:09.845 --> 27:12.108
Gia! Nico! Come here.
We're about to take her

27:12.152 --> 27:13.632
on a family vacation
with us to the Bahamas.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.851
I'll give you a week
in my Mazatlán time-share.

27:15.895 --> 27:18.288
You can stay in my guest house
for three months.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.855
I will lease you a car,
fully loaded.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.204
Quick. Tell Felicia
you love her.

27:21.248 --> 27:23.337
I love you, Felicia.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.773
I love you, Felicia.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.079
I love you, Felicia.

27:26.122 --> 27:28.777
See? Look at those faces.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.650
[gasps]

27:31.693 --> 27:34.435
You can have a three-episode
arc in my new series

27:34.478 --> 27:36.785
starring River Fields.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.791
I'm sorry.
You know acting is my dream.

27:42.835 --> 27:45.446
Bye, Felicia.

27:45.489 --> 27:47.666
Later, Slater.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.319
When can you start?

27:49.363 --> 27:51.321
ALBA:
1920.

27:51.365 --> 27:55.151
That is the year women
got the right to vote.Work it, Abuela! Oh!

27:55.195 --> 27:57.806
That's ten out of ten.
You're gonna kill this test.

28:00.156 --> 28:02.681
Okay, I'll meet you
at Mom's house after work.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.774
Oh.
[gasps]

28:10.863 --> 28:13.256
Thanks for holding
the door.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.259
So, how are you?

28:16.303 --> 28:18.305
Fine.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.701
You know, I saw that
you were reading

28:22.744 --> 28:24.703
What Happened in the
Alleythe other day.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.269
How?
Sorry?

28:26.313 --> 28:29.577
How did you see?
I noticed it
in your bag.

28:29.620 --> 28:32.232
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah,
that's a little stalkerish.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.842
It was sticking out.

28:33.886 --> 28:36.497
Uh, anyway, I
love that book.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.630
Not a fan. I have a client who's
accusing the author of slander.

28:39.674 --> 28:42.242
Oh. That's... too bad.

28:42.285 --> 28:44.244
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
How long is this ride?

28:44.287 --> 28:46.463
Is she really not
at her floor yet?

28:46.507 --> 28:49.815
So, listen, I don't know if we
got off on the wrong foot.

28:49.858 --> 28:51.599
[sighs]

28:51.642 --> 28:54.080
No, it's cool.
I don't have a problem with you.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.258
Right.

28:58.301 --> 29:01.565
But beyond not having
a problem with me,

29:01.609 --> 29:03.393
I'd love us
to get along.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.439
How come?
How come?

29:05.482 --> 29:07.615
Because you're really
important to Petra.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.922
[elevator bell dings]LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, thank God!

29:09.965 --> 29:11.793
Anyway, I tried.

29:16.493 --> 29:18.147
You cornered J.R.
in an elevator

29:18.191 --> 29:20.280
and said she's really
important to me?

29:20.323 --> 29:22.673
I didn't say that exactly.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Actually verbatim.

29:22.717 --> 29:26.460
Jane!I'm sorry, but it's true, and I
just wanted to connect with her.

29:26.503 --> 29:29.637
Just get over it! Everyone's
not going to love you.
