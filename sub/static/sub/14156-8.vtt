06:30.467 --> 06:32.300

06:32.300 --> 06:34.500
KEISHA GREENE DID PICK UP A

06:34.500 --> 06:36.733

06:36.733 --> 06:39.100
ONLY THING, JUST LIKE YOUR LOAN

06:39.100 --> 06:40.233
TO ME.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.333
THANKS AGAIN FOR THAT.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.700

07:07.200 --> 07:09.367
[laughter]

07:10.967 --> 07:13.667
IS THIS FAMILIAR, TOO?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.733
>> A LITTLE TOO FAMILIAR.

07:15.733 --> 07:17.500
SO GO BACK TO BEING GOOFY,

07:31.300 --> 07:32.300
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH US JUST

07:32.300 --> 07:33.300

07:33.300 --> 07:34.533
IF ANYTHING ELSE IS GONNA
