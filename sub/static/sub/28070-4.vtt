00:30.605 --> 00:31.605
No!

00:45.645 --> 00:46.685
Tell me something.

00:46.765 --> 00:49.805
If I pull you up,
will you form a coalition with the Left?

00:52.285 --> 00:54.285
- Enough, I've fucking had it with you.
- No!

00:58.925 --> 01:00.165
I'm begging you!

01:04.165 --> 01:06.325
Talk. But it's your last chance.

01:06.405 --> 01:10.244
When people are afraid, the Right wins.
It's always been like that.

01:12.285 --> 01:14.085
Have you seen the polls?

01:15.405 --> 01:17.965
If you want to build the port,
you'll have to do what I say.

01:25.645 --> 01:27.165
What do we do, Dad?

01:44.325 --> 01:45.765
If you're bullshitting us,

01:46.765 --> 01:49.325
I swear I'll come and get you at home,

01:49.405 --> 01:51.005
with your wife

01:51.565 --> 01:52.605
and your kids.

02:27.125 --> 02:29.765
I didn't know
you were interested in politics.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.285
I'm not.
I don't understand jackshit about it.

02:33.565 --> 02:35.085
He was with the Left.

02:35.565 --> 02:37.845
Then he formed
his own party and won a ton of votes.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.325
Good to know.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.925
But I think you'll understand
this very well.

02:59.045 --> 03:02.645
They're tickets to the concert we've been
talking about for... Who knows?

03:03.765 --> 03:05.685
Two months? And it's tonight.

03:05.765 --> 03:08.045
You understand
what I do for a living, don't you?

03:10.485 --> 03:12.925
Sure, but even you get a day off,
don't you?

03:14.965 --> 03:16.365
I wish I could, Teo.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.405
- What's he got to do with you?
- We'll find out.

03:30.725 --> 03:32.405
Listen, I'll try to make it.

03:33.805 --> 03:36.605
But just in case, you hold onto them.
Now I've got to go.

03:55.205 --> 03:58.805
What are you doing?
Just going to sit there and sulk all day?

03:58.885 --> 04:02.845
Mind your own business, Nadia.
You don't know what you're talking about.

04:05.005 --> 04:06.325
You're right, I don't know.

04:07.725 --> 04:11.125
But it doesn't take a genius to realize
that you needed those guns for a reason.

04:11.205 --> 04:12.805
And that it went wrong.

04:13.885 --> 04:15.245
What do you want?

04:16.445 --> 04:17.805
I came to say goodbye.

04:19.245 --> 04:21.605
- And to say thank you.
- And now you've said it.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.125
Look, if it wasn't for me,
you'd be dead by now.

04:27.525 --> 04:29.445
I knew you were an asshole.

04:29.525 --> 04:31.445
But I didn't know you were so soft.

04:31.525 --> 04:34.165
I'm tired of living surrounded by ghosts.

04:34.885 --> 04:37.005
- Then send them away.
- I'm trying to.

04:37.085 --> 04:38.085
How?

04:38.805 --> 04:40.405
You've got them tattooed on you.

04:42.445 --> 04:45.365
- Who are the wings for?
- For someone who's not here anymore.

04:47.805 --> 04:50.245
And who had fuck all to do with this shit.

04:51.285 --> 04:53.525
I'm sorry,
but now you have to live your life.

04:53.605 --> 04:57.285
I don't have a life anymore.
That piece of shit took everything I had.

04:58.885 --> 05:00.245
Do what you've got to do.

05:01.365 --> 05:03.525
But no vendetta will bring
the dead back to life.

05:06.525 --> 05:08.045
Your cousins will be around.

05:08.605 --> 05:10.205
Sure, but I'll be all right with this.

05:27.525 --> 05:29.845
There was no need
to come all the way here.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.525
What are you saying?

05:34.365 --> 05:36.845
That I was wrong to come and see you?

05:37.205 --> 05:39.085
You can't even control Cinaglia.

05:39.165 --> 05:41.285
Cinaglia isn't a problem.
I'll take care of him.

05:41.365 --> 05:42.525
Already done.

05:43.485 --> 05:45.845
- What does that mean?
- For a politician, he's got balls.

05:45.925 --> 05:47.405
And so we gave him a chance.

05:47.485 --> 05:50.205
What chance are you talking about?
I don't understand.

05:50.765 --> 05:52.485
He might be right.

05:53.725 --> 05:56.725
- The Right could win.
- Cinaglia's talking shit.

05:56.805 --> 05:59.205
All the polls say
the Left is going to win.

05:59.285 --> 06:01.685
In this city,
things don't just change in a few days.

06:01.765 --> 06:03.445
Let's do this: if he wins,

06:03.525 --> 06:05.045
I'm with him.

06:05.125 --> 06:06.525
And I'll get rid of you.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.045
If the Left wins,

06:09.125 --> 06:11.125
I'll get rid of him and keep you.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.245
You've already lost Cinaglia.

06:15.325 --> 06:17.165
You need to find someone else on the Left.

06:21.445 --> 06:23.165
We made a deal.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.045
And deals must be respected.

06:27.045 --> 06:29.045
Why, do you respect deals?

06:30.405 --> 06:33.485
You couldn't even get rid of a handful
of fucking refugees.

06:33.565 --> 06:36.885
There are 500 of them, not a handful.
And Rome isn't Palermo.

06:37.885 --> 06:39.885
Listen to me well

06:39.965 --> 06:42.645
because it's the last time I'll say this.

06:43.405 --> 06:44.565
First of all,

06:45.125 --> 06:46.885
get rid of the refugees

06:46.965 --> 06:49.645
and get work started on the port
before the election.

06:50.325 --> 06:52.125
Then, take whatever ally you want

06:52.205 --> 06:54.405
and try to save your ass.

07:40.165 --> 07:41.525
Barzacci.

07:41.605 --> 07:42.605
Cinaglia.

07:46.525 --> 07:49.125
These are hellish days.
You know that, don't you?

07:50.725 --> 07:52.285
Did you think about what I said?

07:52.845 --> 07:53.845
Yes.

07:54.725 --> 07:58.165
And I realized that the nine percent
from your grassroots movement

07:58.245 --> 08:01.525
risks losing us ten percent
of the Right's electorate.

08:04.125 --> 08:06.085
Did you see
what happened last night in Ostia?

08:06.165 --> 08:08.405
- Yes, of course.
- People are pissed off.

08:09.965 --> 08:12.445
We've got to surf this wave of anger.

08:13.925 --> 08:15.805
It's the only way we can win.

08:16.405 --> 08:19.125
Yesterday's chaos happens only once.

08:19.205 --> 08:21.805
We're in Rome, Cinaglia, not the Far West.

08:44.164 --> 08:45.564
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:47.325 --> 08:48.325
Well?

08:58.565 --> 08:59.565
It's Guerri.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.605
Samurai's right-hand man.

09:03.045 --> 09:07.285
- Is that why his career has moved so fast?
- I'm not excluding anything.

09:10.885 --> 09:13.085
Why does a guy like Samurai need Lele?

09:15.125 --> 09:16.805
We're going to find out.

09:19.165 --> 09:20.765
Don't worry, you're not alone.

09:36.245 --> 09:37.245
Well?

09:39.285 --> 09:40.365
What happened?

09:42.685 --> 09:44.125
There was a piece missing.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.365
A politician?

09:49.445 --> 09:52.485
Samurai wants the refugee camp cleared
so he can build the port there.

09:52.565 --> 09:55.805
Only he didn't get his way last night
and now he's trying with this politician.

09:57.725 --> 09:59.525
Or else with some cardinal in the Vatican.

10:01.005 --> 10:02.805
I'll take care of the politician.

10:03.365 --> 10:05.285
I'll tell him
to mind his own fucking business.

10:06.365 --> 10:08.645
Let me know
who the priest in the Vatican is.

10:08.725 --> 10:11.325
We've got to figure out
Samurai's next move. Let's go.

10:12.605 --> 10:13.925
Hey, give us a smile.

10:14.765 --> 10:16.125
Here we go again.

10:27.805 --> 10:30.405
Explain this to me. What does Samurai say?

10:30.485 --> 10:34.205
[in Sinti] [That we have to wait,
that Ostia needs to lie low for now.]

10:35.205 --> 10:36.925
[He didn't keep his word.]

10:37.005 --> 10:39.565
[He disrespected us
and now we have to take Ostia on our own.]

10:39.645 --> 10:41.005
[We won't buy our coke from him.]

10:41.085 --> 10:43.925
[I didn't give you my money
to go against Samurai.]

10:44.005 --> 10:48.165
[Samurai said he'd give us Ostia,
then he asked me for money.]

10:48.245 --> 10:51.485
[Now we have to go it alone,
without asking anyone's permission.]

10:51.565 --> 10:54.245
Okay, but how do we do that?
He'll find out for sure.

10:54.325 --> 10:56.325
Yeah, but after it's already done.

10:56.965 --> 10:59.125
We pick up the coke from Giulianova Port.

10:59.605 --> 11:01.365
There are these Bulgarian gypsies,

11:01.445 --> 11:03.565
and I know their leader
from when I was in Abruzzo.

11:03.645 --> 11:04.965
He buys in Rotterdam,

11:05.045 --> 11:07.125
brings it to the Balkans
and then over here by boat.

11:07.205 --> 11:09.485
The boys are already getting ready to go.

11:10.205 --> 11:11.485
I'll go.

11:14.125 --> 11:17.045
You're not going anywhere.
This is already madness.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.285
Without me this deal wouldn't exist.

11:20.845 --> 11:22.765
And besides, a woman will stand out less.

11:48.325 --> 11:49.325
[All right.]

11:50.085 --> 11:51.685
Alex is going with you, though.

11:57.005 --> 11:58.005
Cinaglia.

12:01.245 --> 12:02.645
POLICE DATABASE

12:08.485 --> 12:10.245
Yes? Come in.

12:13.885 --> 12:16.005
- Have you read the report?
- Yes.

12:16.085 --> 12:18.125
- It looks fine to me.
- What's on for today?

12:22.005 --> 12:23.365
Let's see...

12:30.165 --> 12:32.445
I'm also with the police
because of my father.

12:34.925 --> 12:36.725
- Is he a cop, too?
- No.

12:38.605 --> 12:40.405
- What does he do?
- Anything he can.

12:40.485 --> 12:42.005
To support his family.

12:44.005 --> 12:46.245
So you joined the police
to make him happy?

12:46.805 --> 12:49.885
At the beginning, yes.
Regular pay, paid holidays.

12:50.525 --> 12:51.525
Dad was very happy.

12:52.085 --> 12:55.725
But when I put on the uniform,
I realized I wanted something more.

12:57.525 --> 12:59.645
I started to believe in it for real.

13:00.325 --> 13:02.645
I realized that too,
the first time I put it on.

13:08.725 --> 13:10.325
Lele, I'm here for you.

13:10.405 --> 13:11.685
For anything at all.

13:13.965 --> 13:14.965
Thank you.

13:16.885 --> 13:18.685
Take care of this, please.

13:19.485 --> 13:20.485
Okay.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.245
See you later.

13:27.925 --> 13:30.165
Hey, I still owe you a beer.

13:31.885 --> 13:33.205
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:40.045 --> 13:42.365
The only solution
is to go and talk to Nascari.

13:47.805 --> 13:50.845
- Let's go talk to him.
- No, I'm not coming.

13:53.565 --> 13:56.565
No risky moves before my nomination.

14:08.085 --> 14:10.925
Call this fucking cardinal
and I'll go talk to him right now.

14:34.085 --> 14:36.285
Wooden coffins are so ugly.

14:37.005 --> 14:39.605
- Better gold, right?
- Better nothing, Spadino.

14:39.685 --> 14:42.245
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, a nice bonfire.

14:43.245 --> 14:44.845
And then you're ashes.

14:45.405 --> 14:46.405
And then?

14:47.285 --> 14:48.285
Then nothing.

14:49.605 --> 14:51.365
Ash goes wherever it wants to.

14:52.965 --> 14:54.645
I don't like that.

14:56.725 --> 14:58.565
I want to end up where I say.

14:59.325 --> 15:00.325
Where?

15:02.925 --> 15:04.285
In Prima Porta Cemetery.

15:05.125 --> 15:06.485
Near my father.

15:10.885 --> 15:12.725
Where do you want to go?

15:15.445 --> 15:16.885
I'm going to be cremated.

15:19.645 --> 15:21.165
And have them throw me into the sea.

15:28.365 --> 15:29.925
We'll make Samurai pay.

15:34.205 --> 15:35.885
Because you and I, Aureliano,

15:36.445 --> 15:38.565
have to die covered in gold.

15:39.765 --> 15:41.685
Sure, just like gypsies.

15:41.765 --> 15:42.965
No.

15:43.645 --> 15:45.405
Like the pharaohs.

15:46.325 --> 15:47.325
Hey.

15:48.005 --> 15:49.005
Well?

15:52.005 --> 15:53.205
It's all there.

15:53.805 --> 15:56.125
Home address
and campaign headquarters address.

16:04.805 --> 16:05.805
All right.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.645
- Let go get him. Come on.
- Let's go.

16:34.405 --> 16:36.085
Lele.

16:36.165 --> 16:37.325
How are you?

16:40.285 --> 16:41.285
Fine.

16:42.325 --> 16:43.605
I'm all right.

16:44.165 --> 16:46.925
- Thank you for last night.
- Don't mention it.

16:47.485 --> 16:49.805
- You would have done the same for me.
- Yes.

16:52.605 --> 16:53.925
What were you doing there?

16:57.085 --> 16:58.085
I was with him.

17:01.845 --> 17:05.285
- I didn't see him.
- Luckily, we saw you.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.324
Why did you come here?
What do you want from me?

17:15.005 --> 17:18.124
Tell us which priest Samurai is using
to free up the land in Ostia.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.124
And even if I told you,
what would you do about it?

17:22.444 --> 17:24.483
Samurai will always be too much for you.

17:24.565 --> 17:25.925
That's why we're here.

17:26.483 --> 17:27.483
Tell us

17:28.364 --> 17:30.685
and we'll get rid of him once and for all.

17:30.765 --> 17:32.604
His man in the Vatican is...

17:33.324 --> 17:35.245
Cardinal Giunti.

17:38.205 --> 17:41.405
- Where do we find him?
- That way, we can go and say hi.

18:00.845 --> 18:02.125
<i>As you can see</i>

18:02.205 --> 18:05.085
<i>from these upsetting images
from our live feed...</i>

18:05.165 --> 18:06.765
Have you seen what's going on?

18:06.845 --> 18:08.845
<i>...the municipality of Ostia...</i>

18:09.405 --> 18:11.285
It's been on live TV since this morning.

18:13.205 --> 18:14.405
Yes. So what?

18:16.205 --> 18:19.125
So I was thinking that no politician
has gone down there yet.

18:19.205 --> 18:20.805
You'd be the first.

18:21.405 --> 18:22.765
And maybe the only one.

18:25.325 --> 18:29.205
<i>The citizens of Ostia have claimed
they feel threatened</i>

18:29.285 --> 18:31.965
<i>by the presence of the foreigners,
who they see as heralds</i>

18:32.045 --> 18:33.805
<i>of decline and higher crime...</i>

18:34.765 --> 18:36.445
I'm parked right out front.

18:36.525 --> 18:40.285
<i>Their anger at not having been consulted
and their concerns over the setting up</i>

18:40.365 --> 18:43.925
<i>of the new refugee camp
have been made blatantly clear...</i>

19:04.685 --> 19:07.605
<i>This is Rome, the playing fields
The casinos, the neighborhoods</i>

19:07.685 --> 19:10.205
<i>The plebs, the police
The whores, the trades</i>

19:10.285 --> 19:13.445
<i>This is Rome, the city districts
The stadium, the bombs</i>

19:13.525 --> 19:15.805
<i>Swords under the river
The streets, the riverbanks</i>

19:15.885 --> 19:19.125
<i>This is Rome, the playing fields
The casinos, the neighborhoods</i>

19:19.205 --> 19:21.565
<i>The plebs, the police
The whores, the trades</i>

19:21.645 --> 19:24.685
<i>This is Rome, the city districts
The stadium, the bombs</i>

19:24.765 --> 19:27.765
<i>You're in Rome, which calls you
By your name and won't let you hide</i>

19:27.845 --> 19:30.525
<i>I come from Rome, the "Eternal City"
That shines under the sun</i>

19:30.605 --> 19:32.925
<i>The fire that warms explodes
If it meets with these words...</i>

19:36.445 --> 19:37.925
What is this shit?

19:48.925 --> 19:52.445
- Is this supposed to be better?
- Totally. Just listen to the chorus.

19:55.885 --> 19:57.885
I drive, I choose the music.

19:57.965 --> 19:59.885
Gone to your head, has it?

19:59.965 --> 20:02.325
Do you think you can order me around?

20:02.885 --> 20:05.045
I don't take orders
from my mother-in-law's lap dog.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.605
And that's what you are.

20:06.685 --> 20:08.405
Do you know
why my aunt brought me to Rome?

20:08.485 --> 20:09.685
She doesn't trust her son.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.925
You think you can come here and tell me
what's going on in my own home?

20:13.005 --> 20:15.405
What about you, Angelica?
Do you trust Spadino?

20:16.445 --> 20:17.565
He's my husband.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.885
Where I come from,
husband and wife sleep in the same bed.

20:25.405 --> 20:28.405
They sent me to Abruzzo
because I know him all too well.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.845
- What are you trying to say?
- Me? Nothing.

20:35.725 --> 20:37.525
That you're wasted on him.

20:58.165 --> 21:01.605
We don't want any refugee camps!

21:01.685 --> 21:06.765
We don't want any refugee camps!

21:11.445 --> 21:13.645
- Hey, Adriano.
- My friend.

21:14.325 --> 21:16.365
Have you seen what's fucking going on?

21:16.845 --> 21:19.885
I heard they even injured
the volunteer running this slum.

21:20.365 --> 21:22.485
- Who? Monaschi?
- Yes, yes, I think so.

21:22.565 --> 21:24.965
She ended up in the hospital.
It was a close shave.

21:52.965 --> 21:54.205
I think this is it.

22:02.165 --> 22:03.565
They'll never let us in.

22:05.205 --> 22:07.925
- What, are you shitting your pants, Lele?
- I'm not the problem.

22:08.005 --> 22:09.445
They'll let me in, but not you.

22:29.445 --> 22:30.405
Good evening.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.085
He's a colleague, he's with me.

22:34.165 --> 22:35.965
- All right, go through.
- Thank you.

22:45.605 --> 22:50.365
Because if Rome takes responsibility
for all the emergencies in the world,

22:50.445 --> 22:53.205
Rome itself
will end up being the emergency.

22:53.285 --> 22:54.285
Bravo!

23:01.045 --> 23:02.285
See you, man.

23:02.365 --> 23:03.365
Bravo.

23:04.125 --> 23:05.125
Bravo!

23:14.565 --> 23:16.205
- Great job!
- Thank you. Goodbye.

23:16.285 --> 23:18.645
Bravo, you're a great man. Bravo.

23:18.725 --> 23:20.365
- Bravo!
- Thank you.

23:25.245 --> 23:26.325
Nice speech.

23:27.765 --> 23:30.925
- I do what I can.
- You also do what you can't do.

23:33.565 --> 23:34.805
Do you understand?

23:36.765 --> 23:38.765
Come with me and I'll explain it to you.

23:53.005 --> 23:54.565
Go take your applause, Cinaglia.

23:55.725 --> 23:56.725
Thank you.

24:05.205 --> 24:06.365
I think it's this one.

24:09.445 --> 24:10.565
Okay.

24:11.805 --> 24:12.845
Wait for me here.

24:21.405 --> 24:22.965
May I come in?

24:26.125 --> 24:27.125
Yes?

24:29.805 --> 24:31.845
Aren't you relaxing a bit too much?

24:33.445 --> 24:35.405
I don't believe I know you.

24:37.605 --> 24:40.765
What are you and Samurai doing
with those poor refugees?

24:40.845 --> 24:42.845
What are you talking about?

24:44.725 --> 24:46.645
You work for Samurai, don't you?

24:49.685 --> 24:52.405
He must have asked you to do something
to free up that land.

24:52.485 --> 24:53.805
What land...

24:55.405 --> 24:56.605
My friend...

24:57.685 --> 25:00.205
Do you remember Monsignor Theodosiou?

25:00.285 --> 25:02.085
Do you want to jump off a tower too?

25:03.125 --> 25:06.205
He only wants to send the refugees away,
that's all.

25:06.765 --> 25:08.485
What did he say to you?

25:08.565 --> 25:12.725
That he wanted to talk to the cardinal
who currently has the power to do so.

25:13.285 --> 25:14.285
Who's that?

25:14.965 --> 25:15.965
Nascari.

25:16.525 --> 25:19.085
Samurai wants the matter
taken care of today.

25:19.165 --> 25:21.965
I simply put them in touch.

25:22.045 --> 25:24.165
So you want to go out with a bang, do you?

25:24.245 --> 25:25.485
That's all I know.

25:26.685 --> 25:28.205
I swear.

25:30.045 --> 25:31.565
Don't swear, priest.

25:32.525 --> 25:33.525
You shouldn't swear.

25:36.685 --> 25:38.565
Not even when ordered to.

25:39.965 --> 25:41.485
Don't say anything to Samurai

25:41.565 --> 25:44.045
or next time I'll come back for you.

25:58.045 --> 25:59.365
Do you see anyone?

26:00.805 --> 26:01.805
No.

26:03.445 --> 26:04.445
Come on.

26:26.725 --> 26:29.565
- Where's this guy supposed to be?
- At the end of the pier, he said.

26:30.685 --> 26:31.965
I don't like it.

26:33.245 --> 26:35.325
- Where the fuck are you going?
- Hurry up.

26:50.165 --> 26:51.765
What, this tiny boat?

26:53.085 --> 26:54.805
As long as the stuff's here, Angelica.

26:57.645 --> 26:58.645
Okay, I'll go.

26:59.845 --> 27:00.885
You don't get it.

27:01.365 --> 27:02.965
Wait here and behave yourself.

27:22.765 --> 27:26.925
G.B. GRASSI HOSPITAL

27:27.885 --> 27:29.205
Mrs. Monaschi.

27:30.125 --> 27:31.245
Is everything okay?

27:32.085 --> 27:33.645
- Yes.
- You're all right?

27:34.245 --> 27:36.445
- Yes, yes, I'm fine.
- I'm glad.

27:37.005 --> 27:39.245
You're doing a great job
at the refugee camp.

27:39.965 --> 27:41.965
You didn't deserve to end up in here.

27:42.525 --> 27:44.765
Don't worry, I won't be quitting.

27:49.845 --> 27:51.045
We have to go!

28:26.005 --> 28:28.205
- These bags are so heavy.
- Hey.

28:34.485 --> 28:36.885
<i>You can't be here. The port is closed.</i>

28:42.085 --> 28:43.205
Don't turn around.

28:44.925 --> 28:48.125
- Let's get a move on.
- That'll only make things worse.

28:48.685 --> 28:49.485
Fuck!

28:59.805 --> 29:01.445
<i>Stop! Coast Guard!</i>

29:03.005 --> 29:04.045
Fuck!

29:30.325 --> 29:33.325
Fuck!
What the fuck are we going to do now?

29:56.445 --> 29:57.805
Get out of the car, at once!

29:59.125 --> 30:00.965
Can't you see he's hurt? Show him.

30:02.525 --> 30:04.205
He fell from the boat.

30:04.285 --> 30:06.285
We were rushing to the emergency room.

30:08.405 --> 30:10.565
Can we go or does he have
to bleed to death?

30:11.725 --> 30:15.085
- Okay, but he can't drive like that.
- Well, I can't drive, I'm only 17.

30:15.165 --> 30:16.765
Will you drive us?

30:20.525 --> 30:22.685
Go. But drive slowly.

30:22.765 --> 30:23.765
Thank you.

30:25.085 --> 30:25.925
Let's go.

30:45.485 --> 30:47.725
Now you understand
who the fuck's in charge, right?

31:09.245 --> 31:11.965
It's been a long time,
hasn't it, Monaschi? Come here.

31:13.925 --> 31:16.485
What do you want from me?
I've already spoken to your friends.

31:16.565 --> 31:18.605
- Where's the politician?
- I don't know.

31:18.685 --> 31:19.965
- He left.
- Look at me.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.405
He's working with Samurai.

31:21.485 --> 31:23.725
So tell me where he is
and why you were together. Talk.

31:24.285 --> 31:25.405
It's not like that.

31:25.485 --> 31:27.845
Cinaglia's not with Samurai.
On the contrary.

31:27.925 --> 31:30.325
He came to me
to stop the refugees from being moved.

31:30.405 --> 31:32.925
What the fuck does he care
about stopping them from being moved?

31:33.005 --> 31:34.445
If there's chaos in Ostia,

31:34.525 --> 31:37.685
his political allies will get more votes,
and Samurai loses.

31:39.085 --> 31:40.085
Wait.

31:41.085 --> 31:42.085
Yes.

31:47.605 --> 31:48.805
I'll take care of it.

31:52.805 --> 31:54.325
You fucked up.

31:55.245 --> 31:56.685
You sent us to the wrong cardinal.

31:56.765 --> 31:59.325
- And now Samurai's going to the right one.
- What do you mean...

31:59.405 --> 32:00.925
- You know nothing?
- No!

32:02.005 --> 32:05.005
Then you'd better figure it out,
because this time I'll really kill you.

32:21.325 --> 32:22.725
Nice place.

32:25.605 --> 32:28.645
You've built yourself a nice megaphone
to talk to the Romans, huh?

32:28.725 --> 32:30.365
Sure. What do have to say to me?

32:44.765 --> 32:45.765
Thank you.

32:46.725 --> 32:47.965
For last night.

32:50.885 --> 32:52.365
I didn't do it for you.

32:53.125 --> 32:54.685
I would have done it for anyone.

32:56.045 --> 32:58.325
In any case, my interests
are very different from yours.

32:58.405 --> 33:01.245
For me, the problem is only
between Italians and migrants.

33:07.245 --> 33:09.965
But this megaphone can't always
be switched on.

33:11.325 --> 33:13.125
Go back to talking about soccer, Adriano.

33:13.685 --> 33:16.285
Forget about Ostia and everything else.

33:17.285 --> 33:18.645
It annoys you, doesn't it?

33:19.405 --> 33:22.645
Look, it'd only take a second
for this megaphone to become a boomerang.

33:22.725 --> 33:24.085
Understand?

33:24.165 --> 33:26.765
Did you come here to lecture me? You?

33:27.445 --> 33:28.765
I'm giving you some advice.

33:28.845 --> 33:31.285
I quit following your advice years ago.

33:31.365 --> 33:34.565
When I understood that while you talked
about setting Rome on the right path,

33:34.645 --> 33:36.365
you were selling it to the worst Mafiosi.

33:55.725 --> 33:57.885
Watch out for people, Adriano.

33:59.085 --> 34:01.205
They're never what they seem to be.

34:01.845 --> 34:03.525
Are you talking about yourself?

34:03.605 --> 34:04.965
No. About Cinaglia.

34:06.885 --> 34:08.445
I bought him three months ago.

34:27.284 --> 34:28.284
Wait here.

35:03.005 --> 35:04.365
Excuse me.

35:08.205 --> 35:09.605
Have you been discharged already?

35:10.445 --> 35:11.765
Why are you moving them?

35:13.045 --> 35:15.485
I was wrong to bring them here, Sara.

35:16.045 --> 35:17.805
Now I'm trying to fix things.

35:17.885 --> 35:19.925
For the well-being of the refugees,
I imagine.

35:20.405 --> 35:22.125
As always, of course.

35:22.845 --> 35:25.245
What did Samurai promise you in exchange?

35:25.765 --> 35:28.445
It had to be something more valuable
than money, right?

35:30.165 --> 35:33.085
You should go home. You need to rest.

35:59.365 --> 36:00.805
Wait for me here.

36:10.965 --> 36:12.365
Forty kilos, Alberto.

36:12.845 --> 36:14.045
I did it all myself.

36:14.125 --> 36:15.285
And him?

36:15.805 --> 36:17.925
Nothing, he was my driver.

36:18.005 --> 36:20.245
Now let's go home,
and your mother can't say no to us.

36:25.485 --> 36:29.365
I'm not going back home.
I don't feel like taking orders anymore.

36:29.445 --> 36:31.205
We're going back to be in charge.

36:38.125 --> 36:39.645
Why don't you want to go back?

36:40.325 --> 36:41.765
Do you still like Aureliano?

36:45.565 --> 36:46.645
No.

36:48.125 --> 36:49.125
I'm with you.

36:51.245 --> 36:54.365
Now there are three of us.
We have to stick together.

37:16.365 --> 37:17.805
Samurai got there before us.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.445
As always.

37:33.685 --> 37:34.845
I've got an idea.

37:38.205 --> 37:39.605
I need Cinaglia.

37:43.445 --> 37:45.725
- I'll take care of it.
- There you go. Good.

37:49.365 --> 37:50.885
With this, we're coming home.

37:51.365 --> 37:52.645
You did well.

37:54.045 --> 37:55.325
That's all I can say.

37:56.005 --> 37:57.245
It's not enough for us.

38:01.085 --> 38:04.325
Without her, right now you wouldn't have
any money or any drugs.

38:05.165 --> 38:07.805
She's even done too much, I know that.

38:08.925 --> 38:10.165
You haven't, Alberto.

38:10.925 --> 38:13.165
[in Sinti]
[Actually, he has done something.]

38:22.285 --> 38:23.405
[Really?]

38:23.965 --> 38:27.445
[Do you want your grandchild to grow up
outside this house?]

38:41.045 --> 38:43.365
[I've waited for this moment for so long.]

38:55.325 --> 38:56.645
Don't disappoint me.

39:18.085 --> 39:19.085
Enough, Spadino.

39:22.565 --> 39:23.645
Come here, Cinaglia.

39:28.245 --> 39:29.485
Come on, come over here.

39:32.725 --> 39:34.405
I've had an idea for you.

39:35.005 --> 39:36.405
Do you want to hear it?

39:37.285 --> 39:38.765
That's why I'm here.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.005
Me and my friends...

39:42.805 --> 39:44.965
stir up some trouble in Ostia for you.

39:46.165 --> 39:48.085
And you turn that trouble into votes.

39:49.285 --> 39:52.325
- What do you care about votes?
- Us, nothing. But you...

39:53.125 --> 39:54.285
You can use them...

39:56.005 --> 39:57.925
to decide who runs Rome.

40:00.645 --> 40:03.565
That way,
you become our connection in politics

40:04.645 --> 40:07.005
and get us into all the shit
Samurai has going on.

40:07.085 --> 40:09.405
Because now we're going
to get rid of Samurai.

40:09.485 --> 40:10.725
For good.

40:11.525 --> 40:13.405
They're moving the refugees tonight.

40:13.485 --> 40:15.725
You'll be left
with no more material for the campaign.

40:17.565 --> 40:19.485
What kind of trouble are you thinking of?

40:19.565 --> 40:22.085
Just something to scare people,
that's all.

40:22.805 --> 40:24.485
I've got a couple of ideas.

40:29.645 --> 40:31.245
What guarantees can you give me?

40:38.285 --> 40:39.765
Here, this is how it works.

40:39.845 --> 40:43.245
Don't worry.
After a while you'll get used to it.

40:47.005 --> 40:51.245
What more could you ask for?
A cop, a gypsy, and the boss of Ostia.
