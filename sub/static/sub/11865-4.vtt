01:06.371 --> 01:07.576
Deep down,

01:07.743 --> 01:09.775
we all wanna know if we're loved.

01:11.086 --> 01:13.010
It's the fundamental question.

01:14.465 --> 01:17.313
But when I was a kid, the question was even more basic.

01:18.228 --> 01:19.902
Does anyone even like me ?

01:22.560 --> 01:24.859
I'm sure there's all kinds of theories

01:24.900 --> 01:28.709
on how to help girls get over their insecurities and self-doubts.

01:29.449 --> 01:34.642
But it takes a pretty twisted mind to think that swimming day is the answer.

01:35.491 --> 01:36.670
Thanks a lot, mom.

01:37.038 --> 01:37.869
Come on !

01:39.519 --> 01:40.208
Hey !

01:40.308 --> 01:42.123
Why don't you go say hi to your friends, sweaty ?

01:44.519 --> 01:46.987
Look, Georgia, it's not gonna kill you to make a friend.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.104
It might.

01:49.266 --> 01:50.960
Fine, then let's go home.

01:51.252 --> 01:52.685
I'm not wearing the floaties.

01:53.526 --> 01:54.908
But you're a really bad...

01:55.938 --> 01:58.513
You're not a strong swimmer, George.

01:59.044 --> 02:00.376
I'd rather drown.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.776
When I was 10,

02:10.007 --> 02:13.064
I learnt one of life most valuable lessons.

02:15.804 --> 02:17.918
No matter how uncool you think you are,

02:18.613 --> 02:22.561
there's someone even less cool just a pool's length away.

02:22.659 --> 02:23.533
Hi, George !

02:24.313 --> 02:27.590
And that someone was Beth Anne Miller.

02:31.490 --> 02:32.535
Oh shit !

02:34.450 --> 02:37.199
Recently, I've been thinking a lot about crossing over.

02:38.940 --> 02:40.185
But when you're alive,

02:41.251 --> 02:43.174
crossing over is even harder.

02:49.943 --> 02:51.202
Much harder.

02:54.598 --> 02:55.365
So...

02:57.035 --> 02:58.520
do you wanna go shopping this afternoon ?

02:58.762 --> 03:00.609
- What for ?
- A new sweater.

03:02.585 --> 03:04.516
Yeah, that one is pretty tragic.

03:04.571 --> 03:05.980
I meant for you, Reggie.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.183
I have homework.

03:07.250 --> 03:10.173
You know other girls your age like to got to the mall.

03:10.686 --> 03:11.586
It's cool.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.633
Stealing lip-gloss and smoking behind the food court's cool ?

03:15.068 --> 03:16.036
Fine, Reggie.

03:16.452 --> 03:18.108
Stay here and work on that attitude.

03:18.308 --> 03:19.216
It's pretty.

03:19.777 --> 03:20.915
I'll call the sitter.

03:22.769 --> 03:23.455
No !

03:25.385 --> 03:26.337
I'll go.

03:28.682 --> 03:30.813
What is so tragic about that sweater ?

03:33.809 --> 03:34.759
Go !

03:51.421 --> 03:53.196
This is the crucial step.

03:53.258 --> 03:55.788
The unsuspecting patron peruses his menu

03:56.316 --> 03:57.852
and selects his options.

03:59.546 --> 04:01.087
Kiffany swings by.

04:01.170 --> 04:02.796
She pretends not to notice him

04:02.853 --> 04:05.786
thereby making him feel desperately foolish.

04:06.725 --> 04:08.998
Castrated, limp and worthless.

04:09.325 --> 04:10.569
A right turd.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.037
Now, she owns him.

04:13.114 --> 04:14.444
He's under her power.

04:16.226 --> 04:17.118
Observe.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.904
Absolutely brutal.

04:22.401 --> 04:24.506
If people think you don't like them,

04:24.650 --> 04:25.919
they want it even more.

04:25.985 --> 04:27.666
- It's pathetic, isn't it ?
- Yeah.

04:27.926 --> 04:29.912
Hey ! Captain Asshole !

04:30.036 --> 04:30.711
Yeah ?

04:30.810 --> 04:33.052
This view is ruining a perfectly built breakfast.

04:33.128 --> 04:35.207
I'll have you known men have died for that view.

04:35.356 --> 04:36.200
Okay...

04:36.467 --> 04:39.349
So that was today's lesson from da Waffle Haus:

04:39.503 --> 04:42.325
re-hold the love and you gain the power.

04:44.854 --> 04:45.969
Hey, George !

04:46.466 --> 04:47.900
You wanna come out of the pool ?

04:48.525 --> 04:49.385
No.

04:49.615 --> 04:51.100
I like it here.

04:51.693 --> 04:54.305
Will resurface for food.

04:58.068 --> 04:58.902
You.

05:01.142 --> 05:01.785
You.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.193
You.

05:03.332 --> 05:04.382
Pools !

05:04.570 --> 05:06.670
I hate pools. I hate water. I hate drowning.

05:06.737 --> 05:08.590
I hate anything that makes somebody blue.

05:08.662 --> 05:09.900
What about singing the blues ?

05:09.987 --> 05:11.048
That's always nice.

05:11.114 --> 05:13.383
Drowning is a really, really horrible way to die.

05:13.454 --> 05:14.663
I'm blue....

05:15.078 --> 05:17.448
I'm blue because of you...

05:17.602 --> 05:20.609
You got the blond-hair, blue-eyed blues again, Daisy  ?

05:20.757 --> 05:21.455
Yes.

05:21.707 --> 05:22.685
Hit me, Rube.

05:22.781 --> 05:23.868
Nice to see you, Roxy.

05:24.509 --> 05:25.573
Why don't you stay a while ?

05:26.721 --> 05:28.702
I would but I don't want to.

05:30.227 --> 05:32.942
Now Roxy here is a classic re-holder.

05:33.147 --> 05:35.583
She inspires fear through restraint.

05:35.630 --> 05:38.733
I inspire fear through my 9 mm

05:38.937 --> 05:40.709
and my penetrating gaze.

05:40.785 --> 05:44.512
Is that a pepper spray on your fancy utility belt, Roxy ?

05:44.805 --> 05:46.150
It is, Mason.

05:46.576 --> 05:48.527
- You wanna play with it ?
- Yes.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.477
You are so into pain.

05:58.286 --> 06:02.299
Actually, that isn't pepper. It's chemicals.

06:02.356 --> 06:04.798
Yeah right, Roxy. Whatever you say.

06:04.951 --> 06:07.194
Toxic chemicals.

06:18.007 --> 06:19.601
If you wanna beat him senseless,

06:19.648 --> 06:22.237
nobody's gonna worry about it if you know what I'm saying.

06:22.365 --> 06:23.778
That'd better not be my tip.

06:23.859 --> 06:24.587
No.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.732
I'll put up with a lot but I will not put up with that.

06:26.907 --> 06:30.603
I'm sorry, Kiffany. It's just that my eggs weren't exactly lovely this morning.

06:30.676 --> 06:32.139
Maybe you shouldn't have maced them.

06:32.846 --> 06:34.684
- Thanks, Kiffany.
- See Rube.

06:34.956 --> 06:37.879
You have the power in that relationship.

06:37.982 --> 06:38.847
She loves you.

06:39.964 --> 06:40.957
She hates me.

06:41.289 --> 06:44.265
I tip 2 dollars on a 7-dollar breakfast.

06:44.673 --> 06:46.266
It's not brain surgery.

06:46.337 --> 06:48.422
This is in, like, 5 minutes.

06:48.487 --> 06:49.946
Maybe you should, like, get a move on.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.507
You do that you know.

06:55.621 --> 06:57.883
- You re-hold the love.
- Yeah.

06:58.701 --> 07:01.287
How can I re-hold that which I do not possess ?

07:04.790 --> 07:05.942
Eat your breakfast.

07:12.106 --> 07:14.882
Most girls are late for work because they overslept

07:14.958 --> 07:16.300
or they missed their bus.

07:16.751 --> 07:20.308
Most girls didn't have to spend their morning watching a guy

07:20.376 --> 07:22.392
trying to repair his own lawnmower.

07:27.107 --> 07:29.473
Successfully, I might add.

07:35.131 --> 07:36.002
Slurpee.

07:36.423 --> 07:40.334
The great thing about work is no matter how fucked up your personal life is,

07:40.436 --> 07:42.893
your professional life can make it seem normal.

07:46.293 --> 07:49.001
Holy shit ! Sorry. Are you okay ?

07:49.089 --> 07:50.199
I think I'm gonna to hurl.

07:50.297 --> 07:51.428
No, please. Don't.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.604
Blows to the head always make me throw up.

07:53.688 --> 07:55.570
How many blows to the head have you taken ?

07:55.643 --> 07:57.113
A lot in high school.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.134
Oh God ! Blood.

08:00.604 --> 08:01.976
Here comes the McMuffin.

08:02.063 --> 08:03.127
It's a slurpee.

08:03.256 --> 08:04.520
Oh. Okay.

08:06.077 --> 08:06.978
I'm better.

08:07.957 --> 08:09.589
- That was a close one.
- Who are you ?

08:09.692 --> 08:11.689
Ethan, Information Systems.

08:12.164 --> 08:13.261
Computer geeks.

08:13.491 --> 08:14.428
5th floor.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.650
You accessed my files.

08:16.731 --> 08:17.884
Dolores said it was okay.

08:17.976 --> 08:19.915
I've been beaten up a lot.

08:20.003 --> 08:20.830
And I'm a bleeder.

08:21.054 --> 08:22.594
And that doesn't look like a slurpee.

08:22.666 --> 08:24.985
It's a cherry slurpee, Ethan. Chill the fuck out.

08:26.646 --> 08:30.540
- I'm so sorry, Millie. Wow !
- Slurpee.

08:30.914 --> 08:36.227
I wanted to be here to introduce you to Ethan but Andy in personnel has carpal tunnel in both hands.

08:36.345 --> 08:38.025
He can't even pee by himself.

08:38.123 --> 08:39.096
Anyhoo...

08:39.557 --> 08:44.615
Ethan is one of the top dogs in I.S.. He's here to help us with the nazi issue.

08:44.755 --> 08:46.827
What nazi issue ? Who's a nazi ?

08:47.042 --> 08:48.185
Actually, you are.

08:48.380 --> 08:50.048
But there's a funny reason behind that.

08:50.109 --> 08:52.110
I mean if you find that sort of thing funny.

08:52.511 --> 08:54.339
Ethan is a genius. Humor him.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.700
See, there's this group in Oregon.

08:55.761 --> 08:57.482
And someone put a bot on your hard drive.

08:57.528 --> 08:59.704
And they've been using your e-mail to mail out their...

09:00.452 --> 09:01.399
literature.

09:01.526 --> 09:02.454
To who ?

09:02.561 --> 09:04.773
To whom. But that's cool. Everybody makes that mistake.

09:04.849 --> 09:05.895
Answer the question.

09:05.977 --> 09:07.865
Everyone in this office and, like,

09:08.501 --> 09:10.369
a million people across the country.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.129
- So everyone thinks I'm a...
- Yep, maybe.

09:13.666 --> 09:14.424
Probably.

09:16.503 --> 09:17.567
Definitely.

09:19.887 --> 09:21.439
Excuse me, everyone.

09:21.526 --> 09:23.236
Can I have everyone's attention, please ?

09:24.885 --> 09:25.667
Take it off !

09:25.771 --> 09:27.265
Shut up, you idiot !

09:27.357 --> 09:29.185
I'm not a nazi.

09:30.676 --> 09:31.705
There was a...

09:32.677 --> 09:34.264
What was it ?

09:34.598 --> 09:35.580
- Ethan !
- A bot !

09:35.688 --> 09:36.385
A bot !

09:36.502 --> 09:37.521
In my computer.

09:37.629 --> 09:40.051
And huh... slurpee.

09:40.389 --> 09:42.492
Thank you... for your time.

09:44.525 --> 09:45.887
My god, this sucks.

09:45.979 --> 09:47.623
Oh Millie, this is nothing.

09:47.740 --> 09:49.891
You should have seen the tattoos I've had to have removed.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.063
I'm not a nazi.

09:51.253 --> 09:52.626
You know, in here,

09:53.132 --> 09:55.066
I don't think any of us really is.

09:59.983 --> 10:02.905
So, for what it's worth, I never thought you were a nazi.

10:04.586 --> 10:07.801
So, I guess I shouldn't have been in your seat.

10:07.872 --> 10:10.371
That's like a huge corporate faux pas,

10:10.550 --> 10:12.624
breach of protocol or something.

10:12.721 --> 10:15.809
- I'm not someone important.
- Tell that to the 5th floor.

10:16.044 --> 10:18.834
The guys were insanely jealous I got to work on your computer.

10:18.932 --> 10:21.451
Listen, I got to sort through all these files.

10:21.507 --> 10:23.021
Everyone but Finkelstein.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.174
When the nazi problem broke, he took it kind of hard.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.959
And they all have to be in this exact order.

10:28.025 --> 10:28.921
So you should go.

10:29.377 --> 10:30.749
Like, now.

10:31.377 --> 10:33.913
Actually. It's funny.

10:34.006 --> 10:36.228
I reorganized you file structure.

10:36.325 --> 10:37.158
You what ?

10:41.876 --> 10:42.745
Oh wow !

10:42.813 --> 10:44.237
All your files are there just...

10:44.829 --> 10:45.787
organized.

10:47.702 --> 10:49.729
Okay. Bye !

10:51.904 --> 10:54.143
Ethan. Come here.

10:55.172 --> 10:56.549
I could totally help you.

11:05.202 --> 11:08.053
There are definite perks stabbing smart guys like him.

11:08.717 --> 11:11.786
I had to wonder what good deed I had done to deserve this.

11:12.848 --> 11:14.470
And then it dawned on me.

11:18.853 --> 11:21.760
Maybe re-holding affection does work a certain magic.

11:22.129 --> 11:23.747
Not so close.

11:29.148 --> 11:31.765
Beth Anne Miller weren't exactly the same.

11:32.112 --> 11:33.850
But we weren't exactly different.

11:34.575 --> 11:39.731
We both orbited that thin air light years away from the center of the social universe.

11:40.945 --> 11:41.877
Okay, fine...

11:41.995 --> 11:43.008
We were geeks.

11:43.951 --> 11:46.162
But whatever it was that we shared.

11:46.506 --> 11:47.289
Well...

11:47.453 --> 11:50.838
the ties that bind were a little loose that day.

12:05.716 --> 12:06.658
Can I help you ?

12:08.215 --> 12:10.048
Yeah, I guess I wanna, like, I don't know...

12:11.144 --> 12:12.183
I don't know... swim.

12:13.027 --> 12:14.180
Not like that, you know.

12:14.691 --> 12:17.082
I don't actually need to swim I just wanna go into the pool to...

12:17.211 --> 12:19.094
Not like that.

12:40.691 --> 12:43.220
Hi ! May I see the signing sheet ?

12:43.359 --> 12:45.105
There isn't one. Do you have an appointment ?

12:45.976 --> 12:49.247
Perhaps you can help me, I'm looking for an S. Samuels.

12:49.399 --> 12:51.868
There is no dr. Samuels in this practice.

12:52.755 --> 12:55.842
Excuse me, is there an S. Samuels here ?

13:01.269 --> 13:02.155
You know what ?

13:03.081 --> 13:05.002
I think I'd like a consultation.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.565
- Can I get your name ?
- It's Daisy. Daisy Adair.

13:07.810 --> 13:08.720
Okay.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.621
Fill this out, please. And what insurance do you carry ?

13:11.733 --> 13:13.029
I have sag.

13:13.179 --> 13:15.052
Well, you have come to the right place.

13:16.509 --> 13:18.922
Screen actors guild. I'm an actress.

13:21.724 --> 13:23.203
Wow ! Is she gonna be okay ?

13:23.331 --> 13:25.731
She'll be fine. She's in the care of doctors.

13:30.805 --> 13:31.763
Mrs. Smith.

13:37.804 --> 13:39.581
It can't be the face.

13:44.003 --> 13:45.905
No, no. These are just fine.

13:51.937 --> 13:53.273
Do you love you ?

13:55.133 --> 13:55.968
Yes !

13:56.883 --> 13:59.909
Do you deserve to love you even more ?

14:01.558 --> 14:03.549
Well, I can't see why not.

14:12.483 --> 14:13.897
Fuck me !

14:14.941 --> 14:16.770
It's a bunch of naked old man !

14:20.891 --> 14:22.318
Do you know where a T. Hailor is ?

14:23.061 --> 14:24.188
Oh ! Theo...

14:24.562 --> 14:25.807
in the shallow end.

14:26.497 --> 14:27.957
The one who's yakking away.

14:31.909 --> 14:35.913
So, I'm with my son-in-law, Mr. Silicon Valley himself.

14:36.161 --> 14:38.156
- We were watching the game.
- What game ?

14:38.247 --> 14:39.805
The game is not important.

14:39.906 --> 14:41.115
I don't know, the Seahawks.

14:41.196 --> 14:42.395
And he says to me:

14:42.984 --> 14:44.970
"I know why your picture's fuzzy."

14:45.349 --> 14:46.091
Picture's fuzzy ?

14:46.152 --> 14:48.370
Like the back of your balls.

14:48.903 --> 14:51.417
So Mr. silicon Valley, he says to me:

14:51.503 --> 14:55.330
"I know why the cable is no good here."

14:55.422 --> 14:58.620
He says the problem is solar flares.

14:58.999 --> 15:02.297
"Solar flares are causing your cable to go out."

15:02.373 --> 15:05.548
"Solar flares are giving you a fuzzy picture."

15:05.671 --> 15:06.730
And what do you say ?

15:06.817 --> 15:07.817
I say:

15:07.944 --> 15:09.664
"The reason the picture's fuzzy

15:09.854 --> 15:13.761
is I don't have cable, you know-it-all jackass."

15:35.994 --> 15:37.267
I'm diving.

15:37.937 --> 15:38.997
Jesus, Theo !

15:39.074 --> 15:41.163
Enough with the diving. What would Betty say ?

15:41.225 --> 15:43.359
She'd say "look at all the twigs and berries."

15:47.128 --> 15:48.500
He just does it for the attention.

15:49.002 --> 15:50.282
He shouldn't be diving.

15:50.451 --> 15:52.919
He's got the blood pressure of a jackrabbit.

15:53.902 --> 15:54.634
Hello !

15:57.392 --> 15:59.808
Oh my... Jesus !

16:01.623 --> 16:02.632
I'm sorry. I'm just...

16:06.001 --> 16:08.360
Your balls are huge.

16:09.237 --> 16:10.840
God save the queen !

16:13.814 --> 16:16.625
Come on back, Theo. You're scaring the children.

16:16.947 --> 16:18.769
Relax, son. They're just balls.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.866
So, huh... So, Reggie, where do you wanna start ?

16:27.638 --> 16:29.834
Can't you just meet me in here in, like, 20 minutes ?

16:31.053 --> 16:31.959
One thing !

16:32.153 --> 16:34.826
Okay, one thing we do together. I'm not asking for the moon.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.389
You'll embarrass me.

16:36.670 --> 16:38.805
How ? How will I embarrass you ?

16:39.245 --> 16:40.729
You're doing it right now !

16:43.049 --> 16:44.339
How much do I get to spend ?

16:44.722 --> 16:46.244
Nothing until I see it.

16:47.177 --> 16:47.807
Fine.

16:51.107 --> 16:51.937
Reggie !

16:53.043 --> 16:55.439
You look good in blue. Matches your eyes.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.749
I don't know you.

17:04.936 --> 17:06.074
Oh boy !

17:06.479 --> 17:08.069
What would Betty say ?

17:08.338 --> 17:09.172
Look at him !

17:09.883 --> 17:11.409
He doesn't wanna be up there.

17:12.182 --> 17:13.509
So how do we get him back down ?

17:14.220 --> 17:15.633
We could wave a brisket.

17:23.463 --> 17:26.247
Why does he always pull these stunts ?

17:27.561 --> 17:30.973
Because someday it'll make a funny story.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.642
Someday but not today.

17:34.050 --> 17:35.014
It's a bird !

17:35.428 --> 17:36.640
It's a plane !

17:36.712 --> 17:38.283
It's superThe...

17:38.384 --> 17:40.280
Shit !

17:51.159 --> 17:53.747
Ain't that a cake ? I didn't feel a thing !

17:54.218 --> 17:58.181
That's because I took your soul out right before you hit the diving board, sir.

17:58.822 --> 18:00.772
So, huh, I'm dead ?

18:01.003 --> 18:02.604
That's the situation ?

18:02.691 --> 18:05.016
Dead is the situation you're in I'm afraid.

18:05.398 --> 18:07.516
And now would be moving on

18:07.602 --> 18:09.025
What's the... what's the deal ?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.803
No one can see me ?

18:11.103 --> 18:14.238
No one can see you apart from me unfortunately.

18:15.624 --> 18:18.461
I just cannot get over the size of your testicles !

18:18.937 --> 18:21.488
Imagine that, Betty ! I got a gay angel !

18:21.579 --> 18:22.491
Ew ! I'm not an angel.

18:23.592 --> 18:24.683
Or gay.

18:25.685 --> 18:27.528
My friends for 50 years...

18:27.918 --> 18:29.234
They don't look very sad.

18:29.561 --> 18:31.425
Come on ! Your death hasn't sunk in yet.

18:32.005 --> 18:34.282
It hasn't hit them like it hit you.

18:34.769 --> 18:37.888
They're gonna wanna make some kind of plaque here at the pool.

18:38.257 --> 18:40.165
"Good friend, graceful swimmer,

18:40.684 --> 18:42.361
not a good diver."

18:42.648 --> 18:43.785
Yeah, I'm sure they will.

18:45.147 --> 18:46.806
It's gonna be hardest on Marty.

18:46.996 --> 18:51.153
I mean this is gonna be one tough eulogy. You know what I'm saying ?

18:51.220 --> 18:53.135
I'm sure your funeral will be lovely.

18:53.237 --> 18:54.081
Yeah...

18:54.420 --> 18:56.422
I'm gonna need to put on some clothes.

18:56.488 --> 18:58.388
I've got a nice blue suit, Betty's favorite.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.488
Nice !

19:01.653 --> 19:03.052
What ? For your funeral ?

19:03.141 --> 19:06.017
No... No ! You can't go to your own funeral.

19:06.094 --> 19:07.112
Look, pal.

19:07.379 --> 19:12.642
No one ever told me how to live and I'm sure not gonna start listening now.

19:12.714 --> 19:14.054
I'm going to my funeral, alright ?

19:14.151 --> 19:16.318
I've been looking forward for this for years.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.642
Oh ! Bloody hell !

19:23.784 --> 19:26.896
God ! Can you imagine someone actually wearing that... crap ?

19:27.384 --> 19:28.802
So slutty !

19:30.542 --> 19:32.406
Aren't you supposed to sell it ?

19:34.187 --> 19:36.042
Shhh ! Come on !

19:39.692 --> 19:41.587
I so know what you mean but it's, like,

19:41.658 --> 19:44.172
you don't have to dress like a hooker to get noticed, right ?

19:45.293 --> 19:46.917
What are you doing here anyway ?

19:47.291 --> 19:48.842
This stuff is so not you.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.967
You're... You're better than that.

19:51.053 --> 19:52.119
Here look at me for a sec.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.860
This is Iroquois.

19:56.957 --> 19:59.993
Your hair is kinda like Indian except, you know, lighter.

20:00.566 --> 20:03.844
I'm sorry. That was so presumptuous of me.

20:03.955 --> 20:04.816
It's okay.

20:05.276 --> 20:06.097
You sure ?

20:06.715 --> 20:07.483
Okay.

20:09.931 --> 20:12.153
Reggie, is everything okay ?

20:12.450 --> 20:13.453
I guard her.

20:15.317 --> 20:17.995
I meet you right here in 20 minutes.

20:19.122 --> 20:21.631
I gave birth to her, see, but you guard her.

20:22.858 --> 20:23.873
It's great.

20:26.567 --> 20:28.568
My mom's like that too.

20:28.630 --> 20:32.138
Hypoglycemic so she's totally like dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Hyde.

20:32.209 --> 20:33.319
I've to keep triscuits around

20:33.387 --> 20:35.885
and just shove them in her mouth when she starts to wig out.

20:37.001 --> 20:37.975
So your name is Reggie ?

20:38.250 --> 20:40.222
It's a pretty bad-ass name for a girl !

20:41.076 --> 20:42.557
Can I show you something really pretty ?

20:47.611 --> 20:48.547
In a fair world,

20:48.894 --> 20:50.503
nice people would be liked

20:50.850 --> 20:52.745
and mean people would be disliked.

20:53.529 --> 20:55.418
But that's not the way things work.

20:58.547 --> 20:59.499
Huh, Millie.

20:59.570 --> 21:03.026
I was wondering if you could find me the availability stats for Schwegman's supermarket ?

21:05.402 --> 21:07.553
Never mind, I'll... find it myself.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.235
Keep up the good work.

21:10.297 --> 21:11.443
In a fair world,

21:11.639 --> 21:15.581
behaving like a complete asshole would make you really unpopular.

21:15.992 --> 21:18.054
But this isn't a fair world.

21:18.433 --> 21:21.828
And assholes have followers and disciples and assistants.

21:21.899 --> 21:24.306
The assholes are treated like kings.

21:26.742 --> 21:27.444
She's back.

21:28.136 --> 21:31.376
Like... 6 inches away.

21:32.236 --> 21:38.011
I don't know... She smells kinda like citrus-y and waffles.

21:40.653 --> 21:42.016
I have to go.

21:44.402 --> 21:46.261
Personal call, Ethan ?

21:47.186 --> 21:50.976
Sort of. Some of the guys on the 5th floor had a couple questions about you.

21:51.652 --> 21:52.537
Like what ?

21:53.060 --> 21:55.164
Well, my friend Seth,

21:55.276 --> 21:56.603
he's in data retrieval...

21:57.183 --> 21:59.998
Seth wanted to know what your eyes look like up close.

22:00.099 --> 22:02.000
- So, I told him...
- They're brown.

22:02.690 --> 22:03.740
I said hazel.

22:04.832 --> 22:05.901
You're kinda angry.

22:07.135 --> 22:08.829
No more personal calls, Ethan.

22:09.639 --> 22:11.134
Okay, sure.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.004
No problem.

22:13.412 --> 22:18.236
In a world where perfectly decent girls get brained by cosmic space shit

22:18.292 --> 22:21.112
and get accused of being nazi sympathizers,

22:21.677 --> 22:23.980
I was having trouble turning the other cheek.

22:28.752 --> 22:30.140
Being mean was more fun.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.218
Being mean was cool.

22:36.965 --> 22:37.978
You're dead.

22:39.971 --> 22:41.588
But I was never really cool.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.230
Mrs. Spenson.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.254
Is that a smile, Susan ?

22:58.305 --> 23:01.305
I can't read your face anymore. You've botoxed it senseless.

23:01.356 --> 23:02.697
It's the prize, Sarah.

23:02.949 --> 23:07.219
I didn't know until just now that the human body can withstand that much lipo.

23:07.546 --> 23:10.152
Tell me: is it true the 10th is free ?

23:10.219 --> 23:11.038
Fuck you.

23:11.150 --> 23:12.073
Fuck you back.

23:16.031 --> 23:16.931
How's it going ?

23:20.259 --> 23:23.874
Dr. Simmons said that your ass fat is putting his daughter through Yale.

23:23.930 --> 23:25.042
He's very grateful.

23:25.097 --> 23:27.085
Is either of you a Mrs. Samuels ?

23:27.306 --> 23:28.686
Mind your own fucking business !

23:29.790 --> 23:31.417
I'm Stan Samuels.

23:32.236 --> 23:33.418
Do I know you ?

23:33.510 --> 23:35.861
I'm Daisy, Daisy Adair from the insurance company.

23:35.917 --> 23:37.658
There's been a mix up with your coverage.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.647
They've already made it painfully clear that my procedure is not covered.

23:40.698 --> 23:42.766
Right, it's not.

23:43.033 --> 23:45.072
Why did you ask for a Mrs. Samuels ?

23:46.049 --> 23:48.031
I just assumed you were gonna be a woman.

23:50.719 --> 23:52.264
I will be soon.

23:53.545 --> 23:54.640
I hope.

23:55.507 --> 23:57.006
Of course, you will.

24:01.281 --> 24:04.005
I saw you park your Jag in the handicap zone, Sarah.

24:04.691 --> 24:08.613
Is cellulite now a recognized handicap ?

24:08.690 --> 24:10.191
- Tramp !
- Retard !

24:10.253 --> 24:11.583
- Slut !
- Middle-aged !

24:33.609 --> 24:34.588
Can I help you ?

24:34.746 --> 24:36.769
No, I'm just browsing.

24:37.137 --> 24:39.529
Ok, well, just let me know if you wanna take anything out for a test drive.

24:46.426 --> 24:47.495
You know...

24:48.556 --> 24:52.144
It might be time to try a new product or two.

24:53.050 --> 24:54.222
It's like your house:

24:54.489 --> 24:57.320
you stuff in the foundations then you build from the ground up.

24:57.515 --> 24:58.488
So, for example:

24:59.970 --> 25:02.467
"hate your husband but willing to stray neutral"

25:03.491 --> 25:06.105
or "already kicked his ass to the crib".

25:07.208 --> 25:09.643
What shade is "he's banging one of his students" ?

25:11.072 --> 25:13.254
- What's your name ?
- Joy.

25:13.679 --> 25:14.611
It's a pretty name.

25:16.914 --> 25:17.815
So what do you want, Joy ?

25:19.566 --> 25:21.681
The last ten years of my life back.

25:22.383 --> 25:23.300
I can do that.

25:28.061 --> 25:30.534
Part of me knew that being mean was reckless,

25:30.596 --> 25:32.885
that it was kind of like driving too fast.

25:32.961 --> 25:35.081
So what if I wasn't wearing my seatbelt ?

25:35.127 --> 25:37.595
So what if I occasionally scraped another fender ?

25:38.762 --> 25:41.788
- Christ, Crystal !
- I'm sorry, Millie !

25:42.305 --> 25:44.583
People have to walk around here, you know...

25:44.845 --> 25:47.466
I don't have time to pick this crap up.

25:49.459 --> 25:51.332
Nice girls don't get the guy.

25:52.724 --> 25:54.971
Nice girls don't rise to the top.

25:56.206 --> 25:57.860
Now you made me mad !

25:58.063 --> 26:00.693
Now we can never be friends.

26:04.557 --> 26:07.337
Nice girls finish last.

26:11.715 --> 26:12.539
Theo !

26:13.328 --> 26:14.377
Theo, Theo.

26:14.433 --> 26:15.842
We have these rules.

26:16.006 --> 26:17.865
Okay ? No funerals.

26:18.095 --> 26:19.882
Funerals are for the living.

26:19.962 --> 26:22.184
So they take a couple of days to arrange...

26:22.252 --> 26:24.249
Especially one like mine !

26:24.310 --> 26:26.158
It's gonna be an event.

26:26.220 --> 26:27.899
I had friends. I can't wait.

26:28.073 --> 26:30.061
That's just it, Theo, you can't wait.

26:30.271 --> 26:31.068
You see, huh...

26:31.832 --> 26:33.214
Goodness ! How do I explain this ?

26:33.270 --> 26:34.105
It's a...

26:35.820 --> 26:37.781
You called the cable guy, right ?

26:37.904 --> 26:39.127
And you made an appointment

26:39.216 --> 26:41.616
and that cable guy has made a window for you

26:41.686 --> 26:44.446
and that window is from 12 to 5.

26:44.688 --> 26:46.331
Right ? So, if you're not there,

26:46.407 --> 26:48.512
when he presses that little doorbell then...

26:48.660 --> 26:50.003
No cable ?

26:50.652 --> 26:53.500
I don't bloody know, Theo. I really bloody don't know.

26:53.638 --> 26:58.594
Son, I appreciate the effort but I was in sales

26:58.685 --> 27:02.167
and I've got to tell you you're not closing.

27:02.244 --> 27:04.155
I'm going to my funeral.

27:04.932 --> 27:07.022
Please, at least meet my boss then.

27:07.211 --> 27:10.652
Oh ! look at this, Betty. I'm talking to God today.

27:10.810 --> 27:12.372
No, he just thinks he's God.

27:12.654 --> 27:15.152
You're sure no one can see me ?

27:16.616 --> 27:19.546
No, no, I would have thought that was completely obvious by now.

27:25.725 --> 27:29.187
And that just is not right for them, okay ?

27:32.975 --> 27:33.789
Hi !

27:38.090 --> 27:39.043
Theo !

27:47.799 --> 27:51.776
- When do they call my parents ?
- Are they your next of kin?

27:53.194 --> 27:54.767
Did your parents know what you were doing ?

27:59.374 --> 28:02.389
That's a beautiful cross. You catholic ?

28:02.891 --> 28:04.268
I'm thinking about it.

28:05.452 --> 28:06.379
When I was a kid,

28:06.526 --> 28:08.739
my mom used to pray at the drop of the hat.

28:09.532 --> 28:11.575
Every morning before my dad would go to work,

28:11.632 --> 28:12.856
every time I took a test,

28:14.192 --> 28:16.423
for the pot roast to being tender.

28:17.795 --> 28:19.434
She really never stopped praying.

28:20.489 --> 28:22.880
The power of prayer is very real for some people.

28:23.136 --> 28:23.944
Yeah ?

28:24.319 --> 28:27.386
Well, the million Hail Marys didn't turn me into a girl.

28:29.173 --> 28:30.237
I'm sorry.

28:32.137 --> 28:34.979
Do you think there's a chance I could go to church one last time ?

28:36.034 --> 28:37.196
Of course.

28:41.282 --> 28:44.687
I'm not interested in speculations, doctor. I'm interested in facts.

28:44.814 --> 28:46.959
The fact is you have no chin.

28:47.037 --> 28:49.244
You need a chin implant. I mean look at you !

28:49.428 --> 28:52.013
How do you even change pillowcases ?

28:53.545 --> 28:55.018
And that is everything.

28:55.290 --> 28:58.537
Now Reggie, if you change your mind or whatever, it's completely cool.

28:59.196 --> 29:01.737
Wow ! Check out your mom !

29:02.775 --> 29:03.590
Well ?

29:05.116 --> 29:06.811
You look like a newscaster.

29:10.701 --> 29:11.602
How much ?

29:11.884 --> 29:13.600
195 plus tax.

29:15.355 --> 29:16.389
You're good.

29:21.458 --> 29:22.472
Reggie !

29:22.969 --> 29:24.392
Reggie, stop !

29:25.739 --> 29:26.450
Hi !

29:27.829 --> 29:29.123
Hello. Do I know you ?

29:29.481 --> 29:31.478
No. I'm Steve. You're hot.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.002
Fuck off, Steve.

29:38.258 --> 29:39.312
Who is that ?

29:39.909 --> 29:40.736
Nobody.

29:41.407 --> 29:43.474
Newscaster my ass !

29:48.689 --> 29:50.141
So everything is on your hard drive

29:50.186 --> 29:52.661
and I made you a hard copy in this binder in case, you know,

29:52.753 --> 29:54.944
the whole nazi problem resurfaces.

29:55.020 --> 29:55.712
Okay.

29:56.936 --> 29:58.794
Why are there post-its on my binder ?

29:58.978 --> 30:02.228
I put these post-its at the top of each subsections so that if, like,

30:02.270 --> 30:05.527
say you're trying to find a job for someone, you can type and also drive and you could just...

30:05.589 --> 30:06.848
I don't like post-its.

30:06.909 --> 30:09.593
- Okay, I just...
- Lose the post-its, Ethan.

30:09.665 --> 30:10.985
Okay, sure.

30:11.426 --> 30:13.289
So, I do origami.

30:13.366 --> 30:15.470
I really like craft so I had some extra time

30:15.521 --> 30:17.241
'cause I work so quickly so I made you...

30:19.140 --> 30:20.488
I made you a swan.

30:21.619 --> 30:22.449
Oh !

30:23.800 --> 30:24.762
Ethan !

30:26.817 --> 30:28.270
This is sweet.

30:28.510 --> 30:30.389
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

30:30.907 --> 30:32.320
It was a pretty one.

30:33.703 --> 30:35.635
I guess I could make you another one.

30:35.701 --> 30:38.009
- That's okay.
- Didn't really want to anyway.

30:38.977 --> 30:40.472
Okay, bye.

30:42.571 --> 30:44.429
I wasn't always like this.

30:48.264 --> 30:50.130
I used to be a nice person.

30:52.643 --> 30:53.795
Hi, Beth Anne.

30:55.173 --> 30:59.390
Isn't it weird how there's so many waves but the water is not really going anywhere ?

31:00.051 --> 31:01.638
Why can't you be normal ?

31:01.685 --> 31:03.323
Why do you have to be so weird ?

31:03.682 --> 31:04.619
I don't know.

31:08.719 --> 31:11.310
But being nice didn't seem to work either.

31:13.046 --> 31:14.945
It's like anyway I'd play it,

31:15.693 --> 31:17.239
I wind up alone.

31:23.046 --> 31:24.961
I'm sorry, Dolores.

31:26.169 --> 31:27.290
You know, Millie,

31:27.787 --> 31:31.002
back in the days, when I had all those restraining orders against me,

31:31.058 --> 31:33.341
I thought hate was the answer.

31:33.587 --> 31:36.025
Seriously, Dolores, I'm not a nazi !

31:36.092 --> 31:37.868
Oh I know that, silly !

31:38.118 --> 31:39.316
I'm just trying to say:

31:39.420 --> 31:41.727
sometimes when I have to choose between a bullwhip and a smile,

31:41.897 --> 31:43.039
I choose the smile.

31:47.303 --> 31:49.840
That was one of the first things you ever said to me.

31:50.755 --> 31:54.340
You said: "I haven't seen you smile once."

31:54.832 --> 31:56.096
I don't think so.

31:56.311 --> 31:57.851
I said that to another young girl.

31:57.955 --> 31:59.951
Lovely young girl. Tragic what happened.

32:01.340 --> 32:02.957
Yeah, my mistake.

32:03.079 --> 32:03.981
Millie.

32:05.096 --> 32:06.514
Ethan just quit.

32:06.934 --> 32:07.679
What ?

32:08.076 --> 32:10.032
He said he wasn't cut out for this kind of

32:10.126 --> 32:11.993
"corporate cutthroat culture".

32:12.675 --> 32:13.723
What happened, Millie ?

32:14.312 --> 32:16.514
I had a bad day.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.424
No ! Millie...

32:19.300 --> 32:21.455
Ethan had a bad day.

32:27.339 --> 32:28.490
This park is beautiful.

32:30.028 --> 32:33.220
- All of God's creatures, right ?
- I guess.

32:34.209 --> 32:35.745
I wanted to be a girl

32:36.436 --> 32:38.244
ever since I can remember.

32:39.079 --> 32:41.915
Who wouldn't wanna be a girl ? We're so much prettier than boys !

32:42.805 --> 32:44.019
You're kinda pretty.

32:44.204 --> 32:46.057
You make it look so effortless.

32:46.195 --> 32:47.854
Yeah but don't let the final picture fool you,

32:47.900 --> 32:49.713
this is 2 hours of hard labor in the morning.

32:49.774 --> 32:51.296
No, it's in everything you do.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.255
The way you walk, the way your hair flows,

32:55.079 --> 32:57.214
the way you move your hips... It's perfect.

32:57.399 --> 32:58.893
Are you flirting with me ?

32:59.302 --> 33:01.750
- I'm dead.
- Right.

33:03.270 --> 33:06.636
Still yours is the face I wanted to see in the mirror every morning.

33:07.838 --> 33:08.974
Just perfect.

33:09.676 --> 33:10.618
I know.

33:11.376 --> 33:13.419
But you know what, Stan ? So are you.

33:14.458 --> 33:17.413
I think we both know that's not quite true.

33:17.792 --> 33:19.410
You're sweet. You're honest.

33:19.952 --> 33:22.507
You've got great style. You'd have made a good woman.

33:22.691 --> 33:23.929
Would have, could have...

33:24.232 --> 33:27.294
- I got screwed.
- Yeah.

33:28.266 --> 33:30.693
That's all part of his plan, that's what they say.

33:30.750 --> 33:32.297
That's what they say.

33:34.523 --> 33:35.855
Why are you going to church ?

33:36.227 --> 33:37.919
It's where you talk to God, Daisy.

33:38.471 --> 33:39.638
It's his house.

33:47.476 --> 33:51.005
Reggie, I need to get a move on early tomorrow morning so you're gonna have to...

33:52.741 --> 33:53.780
Wow !

33:56.155 --> 33:57.420
Don't you knock !

33:58.607 --> 34:00.133
Wow ! You look like a...

34:01.215 --> 34:02.268
young woman.

34:03.790 --> 34:05.086
Please, get out.

34:06.304 --> 34:07.343
I'm out.

34:16.242 --> 34:17.205
Thanks.

34:17.695 --> 34:19.072
Matzoth balls are nice tonight.

34:22.373 --> 34:24.786
Do you care if people like you ?

34:24.870 --> 34:27.181
- Do I act like I care ?
- No.

34:28.884 --> 34:30.685
Nobody likes the cops anyway.

34:30.782 --> 34:34.094
But they're sure happy to see us when the shit hits the fan.

34:34.217 --> 34:35.918
Eat your soup before it's cold.

34:39.820 --> 34:42.820
Jesus ! Those are some enormous balls.

34:42.907 --> 34:43.848
Excuse me !

34:46.393 --> 34:47.728
Oh good God !

34:49.056 --> 34:51.768
You have to help me. This man wants to go to his own funeral.

34:51.887 --> 34:53.310
He died naked ?

34:53.397 --> 34:54.862
Smashed into a diving board.

34:55.210 --> 34:57.091
- With his balls ?
- Stunning, isn't it ?

34:57.150 --> 34:58.610
Tell him the rules, Mason. No funerals.

34:58.686 --> 35:01.057
- I tried that, Rube. The thing is...
- The thing is what, Mason ?

35:01.103 --> 35:03.382
You know that thing. You're good at that...

35:03.443 --> 35:06.316
thing that you can... you're better at...

35:06.367 --> 35:08.686
you know, you know...

35:08.896 --> 35:10.007
talking.

35:10.872 --> 35:12.035
Well said.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.138
Please, Rube. His name is Theo.

35:20.682 --> 35:22.633
This is too much ball.

35:26.402 --> 35:28.020
Now he's put me off my soup.

35:28.108 --> 35:30.594
- So, you see what I'm saying ?
- I don't see what you're saying.

35:30.672 --> 35:31.502
I do !

35:31.922 --> 35:33.114
Oh God !

35:34.009 --> 35:35.407
Der Waffle Haus.

35:35.517 --> 35:37.743
I remember when the first one of these went up.

35:37.819 --> 35:41.105
War was over. Didn't go so well in the beginning.

35:41.496 --> 35:45.207
Betty and I were on our 5th date. She had waffles.

35:45.985 --> 35:46.836
Thanks.

35:47.946 --> 35:48.992
Thanks a million.

35:50.834 --> 35:52.452
Come on, Theo. Let's chat.

35:54.568 --> 35:56.420
Look at the lovers.

35:57.245 --> 35:58.606
Kiss her, you putz.

35:59.108 --> 36:00.049
This way, Theo.

36:00.420 --> 36:01.321
Gonna eat that soup ?

36:02.697 --> 36:03.890
Just gross.

36:04.131 --> 36:05.790
Haven't seen many of them, have you ?

36:05.938 --> 36:06.808
My first...

36:07.460 --> 36:08.283
pair.

36:08.344 --> 36:09.616
They're not all like that.

36:10.515 --> 36:11.733
Some are worse.

36:11.939 --> 36:12.728
Poor Betty.

36:12.968 --> 36:13.741
Who's Betty ?

36:15.124 --> 36:16.019
No one.

36:16.690 --> 36:20.070
How does this guy not care if people see him like that ?

36:20.260 --> 36:21.480
He just doesn't.

36:22.999 --> 36:24.766
Do you care if people like you ?

36:25.261 --> 36:25.984
No !

36:28.738 --> 36:30.412
Why ? Somebody said something about me ?

36:30.469 --> 36:31.687
Is it Daisy ? Does she not like me ?

36:32.082 --> 36:33.070
I have to go.

36:34.554 --> 36:36.971
I can't believe this. What ? Has Daisy said something about me ?

36:37.514 --> 36:40.222
That old man is your reap, Mason.

36:40.366 --> 36:41.476
So bloody what ?

36:41.692 --> 36:45.219
Man ! You never met a problem you couldn't run from, huh ?

36:45.373 --> 36:47.442
You're the one who needs some balls.

36:51.399 --> 36:52.461
Night, Rube !

36:54.615 --> 36:55.731
Did she me ?

36:56.180 --> 36:57.078
She can.

36:57.769 --> 36:59.571
And she'll never be the same for it.

37:00.517 --> 37:01.475
You know, Theo,

37:01.916 --> 37:03.479
death has its own protocol.

37:03.610 --> 37:04.753
It's like a train.

37:05.490 --> 37:06.929
You don't wanna be late for your train.

37:07.614 --> 37:11.116
Exactly what that Mason guy said except prettier.

37:11.655 --> 37:12.454
Thank you.

37:13.697 --> 37:15.254
Why do you wanna go to your own funeral ?

37:17.149 --> 37:21.143
I'm just curious. I'll see who'll come,

37:21.592 --> 37:23.499
hear what people have to say.

37:23.677 --> 37:25.746
I lived a long life, you know.

37:25.802 --> 37:27.159
Stories will be told.

37:27.298 --> 37:29.939
Worried somebody might make a joke or two at your expense ?

37:30.830 --> 37:32.677
I don't know.

37:33.349 --> 37:35.762
I was a loud mouth.

37:36.784 --> 37:39.344
Betty always laughed at my jokes.

37:39.595 --> 37:43.170
Theo, you strike me as the kind of guy who he was, not a load of bullshit.

37:43.380 --> 37:45.796
You were the kind of guy who didn't give a shit about being liked.

37:45.841 --> 37:46.902
That's why people liked them.

37:52.769 --> 37:56.087
How long ago did Betty die, Theo ?

37:57.111 --> 37:58.790
Seven years this November.

37:58.903 --> 38:00.946
I'm sorry. I'm a little bit confused. I mean...

38:01.043 --> 38:04.239
Isn't she the one that you really wanna see ?

38:04.479 --> 38:07.088
And I'm thinking she's not gonna be at your funeral.

38:07.380 --> 38:08.115
Yep.

38:09.713 --> 38:10.720
I miss her.

38:11.764 --> 38:13.531
God ! I miss my wife.

38:15.579 --> 38:18.308
I don't think we should keep Betty waiting any longer.

38:21.268 --> 38:24.273
- Let's go find her then.
- Yeah.

38:25.072 --> 38:25.860
Come on.

38:32.311 --> 38:36.003
Rube, do you think Daisy is upset with me for a reason ?

38:37.105 --> 38:38.896
Can't imagine why she would be.

38:39.368 --> 38:42.673
Come on already ! I'm freezing my balls of here.

38:43.736 --> 38:46.314
Sorry, Theo. Wouldn't wanna keep you waiting.

38:56.458 --> 38:57.998
Would you like some time alone, Stan?

38:58.899 --> 38:59.720
Please.

39:18.004 --> 39:19.799
You bastard.

39:19.886 --> 39:20.802
Stan!

39:24.413 --> 39:25.596
Hypocritical,

39:25.744 --> 39:26.569
no-good,

39:26.844 --> 39:28.279
backstabbing,

39:28.315 --> 39:29.236
judgmental...

39:29.995 --> 39:33.521
You said we're all God's children. Except the freaks.

39:33.919 --> 39:35.130
Except for me.

39:38.780 --> 39:39.547
You.

39:39.702 --> 39:40.525
You do it.

39:40.665 --> 39:41.857
I can't. I won't.

39:41.974 --> 39:45.389
- Just help me.
- I'm sorry. I can't.

39:48.380 --> 39:51.559
- Why would god do this to me?
- Do what?

39:52.327 --> 39:55.123
- Have you die this way?
- Have me live this way.

39:57.140 --> 39:59.736
God doesn't love all creatures, Daisy.

40:04.129 --> 40:06.082
I think you should pray, Stan.

40:08.451 --> 40:09.690
I want to forgive him,

40:11.334 --> 40:13.029
but I want him to tell me...

40:13.924 --> 40:15.604
that he's sorry first.

40:45.867 --> 40:47.537
Come on! Go! Go!

40:48.546 --> 40:51.392
Hey, hey! Hey, god's watching you! He saw that!

40:52.012 --> 40:53.384
Hooligans!

40:54.701 --> 40:56.442
You'll pay for that!

41:02.114 --> 41:03.077
Stan?

41:10.625 --> 41:11.684
Stan...

41:26.101 --> 41:28.180
Blessed art thou amongst women.

41:41.805 --> 41:45.225
I don't know exactly what makes people cross over.

41:45.575 --> 41:47.549
I mean, souls.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.924
I think they see light where others cannot.

41:54.779 --> 41:57.421
I think they see a chance to become something else.

41:59.915 --> 42:01.015
Someone else.

42:19.525 --> 42:22.331
Some people are becoming who they're going to be,

42:24.347 --> 42:27.843
others are just trying to be anything but who they are...

42:40.551 --> 42:43.359
And others just can't decide.

42:54.751 --> 42:55.968
This is Iroquois.

42:56.276 --> 42:58.283
It'll match your dark hair perfectly.

43:08.349 --> 43:10.156
Everybody wants to be liked.

43:16.618 --> 43:17.740
I know I did...

43:27.309 --> 43:29.034
but I knew I was still looking...

43:29.501 --> 43:31.707
for something, for someone.

43:32.398 --> 43:33.484
For light...

43:43.365 --> 43:45.822
- Um, hi, George.
- Hi, Beth Anne.

43:46.509 --> 43:48.870
And I had no idea where I'd find it.

44:00.441 --> 44:01.578
When I was 10,

44:01.916 --> 44:03.338
something happened to me...

44:06.969 --> 44:09.513
And something happened to Beth Anne Miller...

44:15.202 --> 44:17.485
and it changed both of our lives...

44:19.764 --> 44:21.090
forever.
