00:02.003 --> 00:05.996
- Previously on Lost:
- The Dharma folks at the Swan worksite

00:06.090 --> 00:10.049
are gonna drill into the ground
and tap into a massive pocket of energy.

00:10.136 --> 00:13.845
And that will cause your plane,
Oceanic 815,

00:13.931 --> 00:18.675
- to crash on this island.
- How do you destroy this energy?

00:18.769 --> 00:21.602
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

01:54.699 --> 01:57.031
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:58.035 --> 02:01.027
- Mind if I join you?
- Please.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.995
Want some fish?

02:08.546 --> 02:10.958
Thank you. | just ate.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.380
I take it you're here
'cause of the ship.

02:14.552 --> 02:15.632
I am.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.474
- How did they find the island?
- Ask them when they get here.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.303
I don't have to ask.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.268
You brought them here.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.769
Still trying to prove me wrong,
aren't you?

02:34.864 --> 02:36.980
- You are wrong.
- Am I?

02:38.284 --> 02:42.994
They come, they fight, they destroy,

02:43.080 --> 02:46.322
they corrupt. It always ends the same.

02:46.417 --> 02:50.626
But it only ends once.
Anything that happens before that,

02:50.755 --> 02:52.746
it's just progress.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.846
Do you have any idea
how badly I want to kill you?

03:06.937 --> 03:08.188
Yes.

03:08.856 --> 03:12.223
One of these days, sooner or later,

03:12.318 --> 03:14.980
I'm going to find a loophole, my friend.

03:15.071 --> 03:17.528
When you do, I'll be right here.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.151
Always nice talking to you, Jacob.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.207
Nice talking to you, too.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.379
Are you gonna do it?

04:27.017 --> 04:28.928
- You do it.
- Fine, I'll do it.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.806
- But you're gonna be lookout, OK?
- OK.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.524
Crops came in pretty good this year.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.027
You hear? Frank bought
the old Simonon place.

04:44.160 --> 04:48.369
I hear he's gonna farm the land
all the way out to Ames Road.

05:05.723 --> 05:08.681
What you kids got there?
Open your bag.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.765
- Where'd you get this?
- Got it over there.

05:17.860 --> 05:22.024
I know you. You're Diane Austen's girl.
What's your name?

05:22.114 --> 05:24.491
- Katie.
- Katie, I'm calling your mom,

05:24.575 --> 05:28.443
then the cops, because they don't
tolerate stealing here. Understand?

05:29.788 --> 05:33.326
No need to do that. I'll pay for it.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.326
I hope this is enough.

05:39.215 --> 05:42.878
Well, as long as somebody pays for it,
guess there's no harm done.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.425
But I don't wanna see you in here ever
again without your parents, understand?

05:53.521 --> 05:55.853
- Thanks, mister.
- You're welcome.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.395
You're not gonna steal anymore, are you?

06:06.408 --> 06:08.490
Be good, Katie.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.993
Welcome aboard, everyone.

06:15.084 --> 06:18.872
We will be doing system checks here
before heading to open ocean

06:18.963 --> 06:21.921
and submerging to our
operational running depth.

06:22.633 --> 06:27.093
You should be receiving your sedatives,
and we '/I escort you to sleeping berths.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.795
Have a nice rest,
see you on the other side.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.348
- We have to get out of here.
- Out of here?

06:37.439 --> 06:40.567
We're underwater.
What the hell are you doing here?

06:40.651 --> 06:43.063
- How'd you get caught?
- I came back to get you.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.610
- Came back to get me for what?
- Where's Jack?

06:45.698 --> 06:49.657
Jack is on his way
to blow up a hydrogen bomb.

06:49.743 --> 06:53.782
- Why the hell would he do that?
- Does it matter? We have to stop him.

07:01.005 --> 07:03.246
Sorry, I'm gonna pass.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.592
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Yeah, I heard you.

07:05.676 --> 07:09.635
You don't get it, Kate. We were happy
in Dharmaville till you showed up.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.676
But now that's all over.

07:14.184 --> 07:18.177
So we're gonna drink our OJ,
take our chances in the real world.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.264
lf Jack wants to blow up the island...

07:23.402 --> 07:25.313
...good for Jack.

07:28.866 --> 07:32.324
Anything in there about how
we're supposed to move a ten ton bomb?

07:32.411 --> 07:34.743
Actually, it's 20 tons.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.490
Faraday never intended
to freight the device in its entirety.

07:39.585 --> 07:42.873
- What?
- He left detailed instructions

07:42.963 --> 07:45.500
on how to remove the plutonium core.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.208
And how to detonate it.

07:50.387 --> 07:54.380
Faraday told me that we needed to
wipe out some kind of pocket of energy.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.807
ls part of the bomb
gonna be enough to do that?

07:56.894 --> 08:01.183
The core itself is a thermonuclear
weapon. It'll be more than enough.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.143
Hey, hey, wait!

08:07.237 --> 08:10.229
We sealed that thing up 20 years ago
and put it underground

08:10.366 --> 08:14.609
because it was emitting radiation.
Does this sound like a good idea to you?

08:14.703 --> 08:17.570
- You're pregnant.
- Which is why we have to help them.

08:20.376 --> 08:23.163
Once the core is removed, then what?

08:23.253 --> 08:27.542
Then we have approximately two hours
to take it to the Swan site.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.840
Two hours?

08:29.927 --> 08:34.546
When Faraday returned to the island,
he was explicit about his timetable.

08:36.058 --> 08:39.016
Well, then. We better get moving.

08:52.908 --> 08:56.150
- Who stopped the damn drill?
- I did.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.862
- Why?
- When we passed 70 meters,

08:59.957 --> 09:02.790
the drill temp went up 60 degrees.
I didn't want it to melt.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.920
That's why we have a truck full of
water. Cool it down and turn it on.

09:08.549 --> 09:12.292
We've just evacuated the island
of all non-essential personnel.

09:12.386 --> 09:16.095
We're in the midst of insurrection.
Do you think this is the ideal time

09:16.181 --> 09:18.843
- for your experiments?
- I've been working on this

09:18.934 --> 09:22.802
for six years. Designing a station
that will manipulate electromagnetism

09:22.896 --> 09:25.854
- in ways we only dreamed of.
- Thought about consequences

09:25.941 --> 09:28.899
of drilling into that pocket?
We have no idea...

09:28.986 --> 09:32.945
lf Edison was only worried about
the consequences, we'd be in the dark.

09:34.408 --> 09:38.117
I came to this island to change
the world. That's what I intend to do.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.032
Let's get it started!

10:17.034 --> 10:21.403
Take five, everybody. We still
got a ways to go to get to Jacob's.

10:22.873 --> 10:26.206
- Who's Jacob?
- He's in charge of this island.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.289
- You said John was in charge.
- I said he was the leader.

10:30.380 --> 10:34.464
A title that I've discovered
is incredibly temporary.

10:34.551 --> 10:39.136
But everyone answers to someone,
and the leader answers to Jacob.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.838
What's he like?

10:42.851 --> 10:46.059
I don't know, Sun.
I've never met him.

10:57.324 --> 11:02.614
You've been staring for the last ten
minutes. Something you'd like to ask me?

11:03.789 --> 11:06.826
Ben told me that he strangled you.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.408
That is my recollection, yes.

11:10.838 --> 11:14.581
He said he was sure you were dead.
He saw your coffin loaded on that plane

11:14.675 --> 11:17.257
that you came back on.
How are you alive?

11:17.386 --> 11:20.719
You've been on this island
much longer than I have, Richard.

11:20.806 --> 11:24.014
If anyone should have an explanation,
I think it would be you.

11:25.811 --> 11:29.679
l have been here a long time, John.
I've seen things on this island

11:29.773 --> 11:32.230
that I could barely describe, but...

11:32.317 --> 11:34.308
...|'ve never seen someone
come back to life.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.521
And I've never seen anyone
who doesn't age.

11:38.615 --> 11:42.528
- Doesn't mean it can't happen.
- l'm this way because of Jacob.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.779
And, ifl had to guess, he's
the reason you're not in that coffin.

11:46.874 --> 11:50.332
I agree completely, Richard.
That's why I'm doing this,

11:50.419 --> 11:51.829
so I can thank him.

11:54.298 --> 11:58.462
Once I've done that, we're gonna need
to deal with the rest of the passengers

11:58.594 --> 12:01.802
from the Ajira flight
that brought me here.

12:01.889 --> 12:05.256
- What do you mean, "deal with them"?
- You know what I mean.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.100
Let's go!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.631
Untie the crate.

12:39.343 --> 12:43.211
- Why did we even bring this yahoo?
- Because we might need him.

12:43.305 --> 12:46.638
For what? He didn't know
the answer to the question.

12:47.517 --> 12:51.305
- That doesn't mean he's not important.
- You think he's a candidate?

12:57.611 --> 12:59.021
He's awake.

13:01.698 --> 13:05.031
- How long you been listening to us?
- Long enough to wonder what

13:05.118 --> 13:06.233
I'm a candidate for.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.537
- Who the hell are you people?
- We're friends.

13:14.670 --> 13:18.504
You smack all your friends in the face
with a rifle and kidnap them?

13:18.590 --> 13:21.047
Only the ones we like.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.547
Let's go.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.228
What's in the box?

13:40.529 --> 13:41.564
Your call.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.491
Open it.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.922
Terrific.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.060
You need a pen, son?

15:07.991 --> 15:09.856
Yeah, thanks.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.997
Here you go. You can keep it.

15:21.338 --> 15:24.296
I'm very sorry about
your mother and father, James.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.889
Come on, Jimmy.
We gotta get to the cemetery, OK?

15:44.486 --> 15:46.727
- What you writing?
- Nothing.

15:52.410 --> 15:55.322
"Dear Mr. Sawyer.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.200
You don't know who I am,
but I know who you are.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.282
And I know what you done."

16:08.135 --> 16:10.342
Listen to me, Jimmy.

16:10.428 --> 16:14.091
I know you're angry at the man
that did this to your mama and daddy.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.470
And hell, you got every right to be.

16:17.561 --> 16:20.348
But you gotta move on, boy.

16:20.438 --> 16:24.181
They're gone. There ain't
nothing you can do to change that.

16:26.820 --> 16:30.358
What's done... is done.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.651
Now promise me you're
not gonna finish that letter.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.368
I promise.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.495
Good.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.330
Come on. Let's go say goodbye.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.515
Let me get this straight.

17:03.607 --> 17:07.395
Jack sets off the nuke,
which somehow resets everything.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.567
So flight 815 never crashes.

17:09.654 --> 17:13.488
ltjust lands in LA, safe and sound,
and none of this ever happens.

17:13.575 --> 17:16.863
lf Jack does this,
he could kill everyone on the island.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.239
- Yeah, I heard that part.
- And you're OK with that?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.621
You ain't hearing me, Kate.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.665
I made a choice and I'm sticking to it.
I decided to leave, and I'm leaving.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.421
Here's your sedatives.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.301
What the hell did you just do?

17:38.391 --> 17:41.679
We decided to leave this island,
James. We did.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.511
And now we're going back.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.894
- Are you serious?
- We can'tjust let those people die.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.692
You want out? Or you wanna
stay here and whine about it?

17:58.995 --> 18:00.986
Unlock the damn cuffs.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.493
Ga/aga to base.
System check is complete.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.744
We're locked on departure bearing
and ready to leave the island.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.622
Roger that, Galaga. Have a safe trip.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.249
See you on the return.

18:14.886 --> 18:15.966
Give me your gun.

18:19.307 --> 18:22.595
Appreciate that, captain.
Now we need you to surface the sub.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.972
What? I can't take the sub...

18:25.605 --> 18:28.688
- I think you can.
- Once we're gone, proceed on course.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.768
Whatever you do, do not take those
people back to the island. Understand?

18:33.446 --> 18:36.529
What if Horace tries to contact me?
What am I supposed to say?

18:39.619 --> 18:40.654
You ain't home.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.951
Go.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.003
Sayid.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.134
- Is this big enough?
- That'll do.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.478
- Are you done with Faraday's journal?
- Take it.

19:36.926 --> 19:40.089
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.927
Over 20 years ago,
a man named John Locke...

19:47.395 --> 19:50.762
...he walked into our camp and
told me he was gonna be our leader.

19:52.859 --> 19:57.853
Well, I've gone off the island
three times, since then, to visit him.

19:57.947 --> 20:01.531
But he never seemed...
particularly special to me.

20:01.618 --> 20:06.237
- You said you had a question.
- You know him... Locke.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.910
Yeah. Yeah, I know him.

20:15.173 --> 20:18.540
And, if I were you,
I wouldn't give up on him.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.140
Why haven't you told him yet?

20:36.236 --> 20:39.649
- Told who what?
- Richard.

20:39.739 --> 20:43.027
Why haven't you told him
about my plans for Jacob?

20:43.118 --> 20:46.076
If by plans you mean
murdering him, John,

20:46.162 --> 20:48.824
I assumed you'd wanna
keep that a secret.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.032
When did that ever stop you?

20:53.044 --> 20:56.582
I started thinking differently
about things when my dead daughter

20:56.673 --> 21:00.632
threatened to destroy me
if I didn't do everything you said.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.128
Wait, wait.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.881
Where did this happen?

21:04.973 --> 21:09.592
In that cavern beneath the temple.
When we went to see the monster.

21:11.938 --> 21:17.399
So you're willing to do
whatever I say, no matter what it is?

21:20.196 --> 21:21.311
Yes.

21:23.825 --> 21:27.693
Well, then, I guess I won't
have to convince you after all.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.701
Convince me to do what?

21:35.044 --> 21:36.955
I'm not gonna kill Jacob, Ben.

21:39.549 --> 21:40.629
You are.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.027
- Paris or Rome?
- No.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.775
- Florence.
- It doesn't matter!

22:04.866 --> 22:07.608
- It does! It's our anniversary.
- As long as we're together.

22:07.702 --> 22:11.115
- We have to find the perfect place.
- l'll settle for finding my sunglasses.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.120
Excuse me, sir, could you help me?

22:18.379 --> 22:21.086
I'm sorry. I'm lost.
Are you from Los Angeles?

22:28.389 --> 22:29.925
Nadia!

22:37.440 --> 22:40.147
Nadia. Nadia?

23:22.819 --> 23:24.901
Time is short. Let's go.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.181
Stand back.

24:18.207 --> 24:22.541
It's one of the Dharma houses.
I'll go first.

24:23.046 --> 24:27.039
Jack, don't misunderstand
who's in charge here. I'll go first.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.421
If someone in that house is a threat,
you might hesitate.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.422
- But I won't.
- All right. OK.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.299
Eloise, go on. After you.

24:35.183 --> 24:38.926
Once we give you the all clear,
then you bring the bomb.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.270
We don't want any accidents.

24:43.358 --> 24:47.522
- What the hell are you doing?
- l'm protecting our leader. Get back.

24:49.614 --> 24:53.198
She's gonna be angry when she wakes up.
That's a lot better than being dead.

24:54.327 --> 24:57.990
She ordered me to help you.
We helped you. Now you're on your own.

24:58.081 --> 24:59.742
I'm taking her out the way we came in.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.453
After you.

25:30.279 --> 25:33.692
All residents, we 're in a code black.

25:33.783 --> 25:37.696
Report with your weapons to your
security assignments immediate/y.

25:40.456 --> 25:45.120
If you come into contact with a Hostile,
you are authorized to use deadly force.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.452
How the hell are we
gonna get out of here?

25:54.345 --> 25:55.960
We hide in plain sight.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.315
You go over there by the gate.
You get two...

26:14.699 --> 26:16.860
...so you guys go.
You go to the pylons....

26:30.965 --> 26:32.000
Hey!

26:33.092 --> 26:34.423
Hey!

26:37.764 --> 26:40.255
- You shot my kid.
- Don't fire that weapon!

26:42.226 --> 26:43.432
l'm carrying a nuclear...

27:26.729 --> 27:27.969
Get in!

27:30.691 --> 27:31.726
Drive!

27:55.424 --> 27:58.916
From the looks of the sun, I'd say
that's the north shore over there.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.344
The sun's over there.
That's gotta be the west coast.

28:02.431 --> 28:06.094
- Really? You got a compass?
- No, do you?

28:29.041 --> 28:31.623
- Thank you.
- For what?

28:31.711 --> 28:35.704
- For backing me up in the sub.
- No problem.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.963
I got no idea where the hell we are.

28:44.015 --> 28:47.849
Vincent, come here! Hey! Hey!

28:47.977 --> 28:52.391
How you doing? I ain't seen you since
the flaming arrows three years ago.

28:52.481 --> 28:55.723
Hi! How'd he survive alone out here?

28:55.818 --> 28:58.184
Oh, hell, no!

29:02.325 --> 29:04.065
Bernard!

29:13.210 --> 29:14.370
They found us.

29:17.715 --> 29:19.421
Son of a bitch.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.548
- Is that a bomb?
- Try not to move.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.016
- We need to stop the bleeding.
- ls Sayid OK?

29:31.103 --> 29:33.310
He look OK? Keep your eyes
on the damn road!

29:35.900 --> 29:38.858
- Should I pull over?
- Yeah, pull over and get shot! Drive!

29:38.945 --> 29:41.436
- I don't know where we're going.
- Swan site!

29:41.530 --> 29:44.943
- Why there? Sayid's shot...
- Hurley! If you wanna save Sayid,

29:45.034 --> 29:47.275
- take us to the Swan.
- Swan it is.

29:47.370 --> 29:50.487
- Jack, what's at the Swan?
- A way to get you back to your wife.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.328
So hold on.

29:58.422 --> 30:03.257
You've been living out in the jungle
for three years, by yourselves?

30:04.595 --> 30:08.508
Sorry y'all got left behind. Didn't you
hear me shout, "Meet at the creek?"

30:08.599 --> 30:12.592
With flaming arrows raining down
around us, killing everyone we knew?

30:12.728 --> 30:16.186
- Sure, we heard you.
- We spent time looking for you.

30:16.273 --> 30:19.811
I had Jin out searching the island,
grid by grid.

30:19.902 --> 30:23.565
- Yeah, we know.
- You know?

30:23.698 --> 30:26.531
Sure, you guys all joined up
with the Dharma Initiative.

30:26.617 --> 30:30.235
I could have brought you in.
Why didn't you tell us you were here?

30:30.371 --> 30:32.453
Because we're retired.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.626
Y'all been scavenging food
and living out in a hut?

30:42.717 --> 30:46.835
People try their whole lives to get
themselves a quiet place near the ocean

30:46.929 --> 30:50.217
where they can live in peace. We did it.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.468
That's what we made for ourselves.

30:52.560 --> 30:57.475
I hate to rain on your parade,
but your condo's about to go kablooey.

30:57.606 --> 31:00.393
- Jack has a bomb.
- Who cares?

31:05.322 --> 31:08.405
Now you say, "Jack's got a bomb."
And what?

31:08.492 --> 31:11.905
- You guys are gonna try to stop him?
- That's right.

31:11.996 --> 31:14.453
We traveled back 30 years in time,

31:14.540 --> 31:17.373
and you're still trying
to find ways to shoot each other?

31:19.003 --> 31:23.372
Rose, we just need to know which way
the Dharma barracks are from here,

31:23.466 --> 31:25.502
so we can stop Jack.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.967
Or you're gonna be dead. We all will.

31:29.055 --> 31:33.389
So we die.
We just care about being together.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.688
That's all that matters in the end.

31:47.907 --> 31:51.320
The barracks are five miles that way.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.200
- Bernard.
- Sawyer.

31:57.291 --> 32:00.249
- Rose.
- Thank you.

32:00.336 --> 32:02.247
Let's go.

32:02.338 --> 32:05.250
- Bye.
- You sure you don't want some tea?

32:09.887 --> 32:11.502
Maybe another time.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.273
| wish you'd never showed me
what was in this box.

32:28.364 --> 32:32.698
- What the hell you gonna do with it?
- We need to show it to somebody.

32:32.785 --> 32:36.027
- What for?
- They'll know who they're up against.

32:36.122 --> 32:41.037
- What exactly are they up against?
- Something scarier than this box.

32:42.211 --> 32:47.046
Don't worry, though. As long
as you're with us, you're fine.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.465
That'd be reassuring
if I knew who you were.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.710
We are the good guys.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.682
In my experience,
people who go out of their way

32:55.766 --> 32:58.052
to tell you they're good guys
are the bad guys.

33:01.939 --> 33:03.224
We're here.

33:17.121 --> 33:18.736
Look at the ash!

33:24.753 --> 33:26.084
Wait here.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.979
I'm here because I need your help.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.327
Can you do that?

34:46.627 --> 34:48.583
Will you help me, llana?

34:51.006 --> 34:52.416
Yes.

35:46.437 --> 35:48.803
- What happened?
- He isn't there.

35:48.897 --> 35:53.357
Hasn't been in a long time.
Someone else has been using it.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.152
Burn it!

36:02.661 --> 36:06.995
I'm no tree hugger, but that's
a good way to torch the whole jungle.

36:10.753 --> 36:12.414
So what now?

36:20.179 --> 36:22.420
I guess we know where we're going.

37:18.362 --> 37:20.318
Oh, my God!

37:28.872 --> 37:31.909
Oh, my God! Call 911!

37:45.472 --> 37:47.929
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be all right.

37:52.813 --> 37:54.769
I'm sorry this happened to you.

38:20.799 --> 38:24.633
- This is our old camp.
- Home sweet home.

38:27.055 --> 38:30.764
Everyone! Richard tells me we should
get to where we're going by night.

38:30.893 --> 38:34.806
So why don't you all take this
opportunity to rest, catch your breath.

38:34.897 --> 38:37.809
Considering what I have planned for you,
you'll need it.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.497
- Everything all right?
- l was enjoying some alone time.

38:58.670 --> 38:59.921
See what's behind you?

39:05.219 --> 39:08.302
- It's a door. How about that?
- It's notjust a door.

39:08.388 --> 39:11.346
It's the door to the hatch
where you and | first met.

39:15.479 --> 39:18.221
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- I'm a Pisces.

39:19.107 --> 39:22.144
What happened that day at the cabin,

39:22.277 --> 39:24.484
when you first took me to meet Jacob?

39:28.700 --> 39:32.534
You clearly already know I was talking
to an empty chair, John.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.500
That I was pretending.

39:38.961 --> 39:41.953
Which is not to say I wasn't
as surprised as you were

39:42.047 --> 39:44.504
when things started flying around
in the room.

39:44.633 --> 39:48.296
But why would you go to all the trouble
to make something like that up?

39:52.641 --> 39:55.348
l was embarrassed.

39:55.477 --> 39:58.685
I didn't want you to know
that I had never seen Jacob.

40:02.192 --> 40:04.899
So,yes,lHed.

40:06.989 --> 40:09.105
That's what I do.

40:15.539 --> 40:16.574
All right, then.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.872
Why do you want me to kill Jacob, John?

40:25.340 --> 40:31.210
Because, despite your loyal service
to this island, you got cancer.

40:33.015 --> 40:37.224
You had to watch your own daughter
gunned down right in front of you.

40:38.353 --> 40:41.971
And your reward for those sacrifices?
You were banished.

40:43.817 --> 40:48.356
And you did all this in the name
of a man you'd never even met.

40:51.199 --> 40:56.239
So the question is, Ben, why the hell
wouldn't you wanna kill Jacob?

44:13.735 --> 44:16.602
- How much further?
- About five minutes away.

44:18.240 --> 44:19.730
You can't stop the bleeding.

44:21.284 --> 44:24.242
- I need fresh dressings.
- Jack, this bomb is supposed

44:24.329 --> 44:27.162
- to blow us back in time?
- We're not going back in time.

44:27.249 --> 44:31.743
- Because that would be ridiculous.
- I need to modify the bomb.

44:31.837 --> 44:35.204
I can make it so it detonates on impact.

44:35.298 --> 44:38.836
Jack, we need to be there
at the moment of the incident.

44:38.927 --> 44:40.918
Or all of this will be for nothing.

44:43.765 --> 44:46.598
- Why the hell are we stopping?
- That's why.
