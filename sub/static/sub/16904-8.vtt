when I'm talking about you.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.560
- [Jack's voIce]
I wish I was more

09:10.560 --> 09:13.000
of a free spirit
like you.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.160
Now freestyle rap for me.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.800
[glass shatters]

09:26.800 --> 09:27.840
- Okay,
this is why we don't

09:27.840 --> 09:30.240
play football
in the studio, guys.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.040
'cause it's too much fun.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.600
- No, no.
Nobody high-five her.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.960
- What?
It's me, the lizard.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.480
You can start
calling me that.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.000
- Look, we appreciate what you
did for the crew last night,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.480
but you left some people out
and that's not cool.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.440
- What are you talking about?
The Blizzard wouldn't do that.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.800
That's another option.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.840
- Yeah, the alcoholics, Liz?

09:47.840 --> 09:50.600
How are they supposed
to enjoy your bar tab?

09:50.600 --> 09:52.720
- I didn't forget
about them, Chris.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.840
Their thing
just hasn't gotten here yet.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.080
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.080
It's a surprise.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.120
And who knows
what it's gonna be?

09:59.120 --> 10:05.840
Only the blizbian knows.
- All right.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.960
- How long do you think
this can go on?

10:08.960 --> 10:10.640
- I've got it under control.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.720
- This is why I hated
my first two weeks

10:11.720 --> 10:15.200
at the royal tampa academy
of dramatic tricks.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.480
No one knew
who was the sluttiest.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.920
But I showed them.
Oh, I showed them all.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.600
And when we graduated
a week later--

10:21.600 --> 10:24.360
- whatever. Jenna.
People's perceptions can change.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.840
- Can they?
Look at me.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.400
I'm ogbert the nerd.

10:39.080 --> 10:44.080
- Ogbert?

10:44.080 --> 10:46.760
- Ah, the microwave lab.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.760
Boys, I received our

10:48.760 --> 10:53.160

Ajay, raj, ramesh.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.680
Where are dinesh,
Kumar, and sunavo?

10:59.680 --> 11:01.840

requires clearance.

- Clearance?
I'm your boss.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.880
I'm Jack donaghy.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.160
the same to us,
John Donovan.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.920
- I've worked here since 1985.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.040
I spearheaded
the trivection oven.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.000
- Trivection?
What is this, 2009?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.160
[laughter]

11:18.160 --> 11:21.880
The future is the tk-421.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.360
- A new model?

11:24.360 --> 11:25.840
How many vections
does it have?

11:25.840 --> 11:27.520
- Five.
- [gasps]

11:27.520 --> 11:28.520
- It's the perfect microwave.

11:28.520 --> 11:32.360
It even has
a new voice feature.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.640
- My god.
- Which one?

11:35.640 --> 11:38.360
- Gentlemen, I am still
the head of this division.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.800
And no microwave ships
without my say-so.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.600
And I guarantee you that without
my 25 years of experience

11:44.600 --> 11:47.480
you did not build
a perfect microwave.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.800
Now I'm going to find out
what's wrong with this machine,

11:49.800 --> 11:52.480
and when I do,
you're going to wish

11:52.480 --> 11:53.720
you'd never been born.

11:53.720 --> 11:59.240
- Well, which time?

11:59.240 --> 12:01.680
- [groans]

12:05.710 --> 12:06.790
- Ah.

12:06.790 --> 12:08.230
What are you
tinkering with, sir?

12:08.230 --> 12:10.470
You know my uncle
was a tinkerer.

12:10.470 --> 12:11.990
Until the FBI shot him.

12:11.990 --> 12:13.630
- Every g.E. Product
has to be

12:13.630 --> 12:15.710
no more than six sigmas
from perfection.

12:15.710 --> 12:16.950
- Duh.

12:16.950 --> 12:19.150
- So I'm taking apart
this piece of junk

12:19.150 --> 12:21.470
until I prove that it
should never be released.

12:21.470 --> 12:22.830
For the, uh,
good of the company.

12:22.830 --> 12:27.390
- [Jack's voice]
Ready, ready.

12:27.390 --> 12:29.070
- Is this about
the company, sir?

12:29.070 --> 12:30.350
Or is it about you?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.590
- I'm sorry, Kenneth.
What?

12:31.590 --> 12:33.950
- Sometimes a place can be so
special to you

12:33.950 --> 12:35.670
that it feels like it

12:35.670 --> 12:37.230
couldn't possibly continue
after you're gone.

12:37.230 --> 12:40.430
But after I left kentucky
mountain Bible college,

12:40.430 --> 12:42.550
it still kept going.

12:42.550 --> 12:45.190
Until it was shut down
because of the wolves.

12:45.190 --> 12:49.190
Maybe this is really about you
not being able to let go.

12:49.190 --> 12:50.230
- Tell me, Kenneth.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.470
What did you major in
at that college?

12:52.470 --> 12:55.230
- Television studies with
a minor in Bible sexuality.

12:55.230 --> 12:57.910
- So not psychiatry.
Thank you.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.230
But if you
really want to help me,

12:59.230 --> 13:03.030
stick your hand in There
and see if you get a shock.

13:03.030 --> 13:07.110
- Aah! My hand!

13:07.110 --> 13:14.550
- Damn it,
it's supposed to do that.

13:14.550 --> 13:16.550
- Everyone enjoying
the ice cream?

13:16.550 --> 13:18.230
- Yes!
- Yeah!

13:18.230 --> 13:19.550
- I don't even care
that we've taken

13:19.550 --> 13:22.670
a 73-minute break
To eat it.

13:22.670 --> 13:24.150
[dog barking]
- Oh!

13:24.150 --> 13:25.990
Hey, somebody brought
a dog to work.

13:25.990 --> 13:27.270
Oh, and it definitely
doesn't have

13:27.270 --> 13:30.190
any of its own waste
on its feet--oh!

13:30.190 --> 13:33.710
- Hey, why is Tony sulking?

13:33.710 --> 13:35.190
- I couldn't go
to the bar

13:35.190 --> 13:37.430
and now I can't
have any ice cream.

13:37.430 --> 13:38.630
- I totally forgot, broseph.

13:38.630 --> 13:39.830
You're a lactose-intolerant
alcoholic.

13:39.830 --> 13:42.350
- I tried to forget too,
But Liz made me remember

13:42.350 --> 13:43.510
in front of everybody.

13:43.510 --> 13:46.350
- Poor Tony.
- Not cool, Liz.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.030
- How not cool is this?

13:48.030 --> 13:51.030
I remembered how special
Tony is,

13:51.030 --> 13:55.670
and that's why
I got him this watch.

13:55.670 --> 13:59.230
- Hey, you think
of everything.

14:15.670 --> 14:16.550
- Of course.

- Okay!
Yeah, great.

14:34.630 --> 14:36.230
And with the kabletown stuff,
maybe we could

14:36.230 --> 14:38.670
talk about some
new opportunities for me?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.670
- [Jack's voice]
Yes, I will make

of those mexican ponchos.

14:46.270 --> 14:47.550

14:47.550 --> 14:50.510
- Yes, nice.

14:50.510 --> 14:52.190
- Yeah!

14:52.190 --> 15:00.390
- All right, Kenneth.
Simulate a rainstorm.

15:00.390 --> 15:03.270
- Sir, I was wrong
about the hypothermia.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.950
I don't even
feel cold anymore.

15:04.950 --> 15:06.550
I don't feel anything.

15:06.550 --> 15:08.110
- Quiet.
Look.

15:08.110 --> 15:10.150
The display
is malfunctioning.

Defrost. Power.

15:11.470 --> 15:13.830
Time. Left. Pizza.
- Oh, really?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.590
That's how much time is left?
Pizza?

15:15.590 --> 15:17.630
- Mr. Donaghy,
I don't know

15:17.630 --> 15:18.910
what point
you think you're proving.

15:18.910 --> 15:21.910
Who would microwave something
in a freezing rainstorm?

15:21.910 --> 15:23.590
- Why don't you ask choctee,

15:23.590 --> 15:26.510
an inuit who wants
a hot bowl of naglak...

15:26.510 --> 15:29.150
a man and food I just made up
to illustrate a point?

15:29.150 --> 15:31.590
- Sir, you have to let go.

15:31.590 --> 15:33.630
At least that's what
my Nana is telling me

15:33.630 --> 15:36.630
from that tunnel of light
behind you.

15:36.630 --> 15:38.550
- Kenneth,
I've told you this before.

15:38.550 --> 15:42.470
Your Nana is an idiot.

15:42.470 --> 15:44.590
- Liz, we're pranking Pete,
and It's going too far.

15:44.590 --> 15:45.710
Please stop us.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.190
- Why would I?
I love pranks.

15:47.190 --> 15:50.190
I'm not the r.A.

- No.

15:52.150 --> 15:57.830
Ooh, But someone
has to be that person.

Hey. Everyone stop.
Listen to Lutz.

16:01.630 --> 16:07.110

16:07.110 --> 16:09.670
- Hello, gentlemen.
Remember me?

16:09.670 --> 16:10.670
- Yes, I had the greek salad.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.190
- You know
I'm not a delivery man.

16:12.190 --> 16:18.270
I'm wearing a suit
and carrying a microwave.

16:18.270 --> 16:23.590
A so-called perfect microwave.

16:23.590 --> 16:26.070
- [Jack's voice]
Start time. 1985.

16:26.070 --> 16:29.190
- 1985. That's not a time.

16:29.190 --> 16:31.310
I guess it could be a year.

16:31.310 --> 16:32.830
The year I started
working here, actually.

16:32.830 --> 16:34.470
That's interesting.

16:34.470 --> 16:35.830
- [Jack's voice]
1985.

16:35.830 --> 16:37.830
- Yes, 1985.
Thank you.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.150
And since 1985
I have never allowed

16:42.310 --> 16:43.670
- [Jack's voice]

16:43.670 --> 16:45.870
- The point is,
my legacy here is--

- [Jack's voice]
over.

16:47.070 --> 16:49.150

Done. Over.

16:49.150 --> 16:50.190
End.

16:50.190 --> 16:55.590
Stop.

16:55.590 --> 16:56.990
- That's my voice.

16:56.990 --> 16:59.270
- You all sound the same
to us, jock dungaree.

16:59.270 --> 17:01.550
- That was me...

17:01.550 --> 17:04.349
30 years ago.

17:04.349 --> 17:06.589
A young man who dreamed
of running this company,

17:06.589 --> 17:10.190
who made a lot of sacrifices
in pursuit of that dream.

17:10.190 --> 17:12.670
- [Jack's voice]
Goodbye. Potato. Goodbye.

17:12.670 --> 17:17.190
- But he's right.
It's over.

17:17.190 --> 17:20.310
Congratulations on making

17:20.310 --> 17:29.670
the finest microwave
I've ever seen.

17:29.670 --> 17:30.870
- Who ordered
the greek salad?

17:30.870 --> 17:40.470
- Are we racist, or do
Those guys look a lot alike?

17:40.470 --> 17:43.310
- You ready for this,
j-dog?

17:43.310 --> 17:45.310
Jam out,
drink some brews?

17:45.310 --> 17:49.390
Talk about everything
and nothing.

17:49.390 --> 17:52.990
- After today, that is exactly
what I am ready for.

17:52.990 --> 17:55.350

18:04.950 --> 18:07.670
This is what I always
pictured college being like.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.030
- I wouldn't really know.

18:09.030 --> 18:10.590
I only had about
two weeks of real college

18:10.590 --> 18:14.630
before Paula
got pregnant...twice.

- Hmm. Ah.

18:51.310 --> 18:54.550
Not stolen property
of adolf Lemon?

18:54.550 --> 18:57.430
Why would you do that?
To get us to like you?

18:57.430 --> 18:58.510
Are you that desperate?

18:58.510 --> 18:59.950
- No, I'm not desperate.

18:59.950 --> 19:02.470
I'm...
[stammers]

19:02.470 --> 19:03.990
just tell me what you want me
to say and I'll say it!

19:03.990 --> 19:06.310
- Liz, it's over.

19:06.310 --> 19:11.270
They know what
you really are.

19:11.270 --> 19:14.350
- Fine, you found me out.
I'm not a cool kid.

19:14.350 --> 19:17.310
- You suck!

19:17.310 --> 19:19.510
- You know who I am?

19:19.510 --> 19:21.350
I'm the r.A.

19:21.350 --> 19:24.670
And do you know what
the r.A.'s purview is?

19:24.670 --> 19:26.550
Rules.
And guess what?

19:26.550 --> 19:28.510
According to the nbc
employee handbook,

19:28.510 --> 19:31.550
your little card game lottery
constitutes gambling.

19:31.550 --> 19:33.270
So you're not doing it
anymore.

19:33.270 --> 19:34.590
- What?
- Come on.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.670
- Boo!

19:35.670 --> 19:36.790
- Also, the next time
I see someone

19:36.790 --> 19:39.670
throwing a football in here,
there will be fines.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.470
And if I see that
filthy dog again,

19:42.470 --> 19:44.430
I will put it down.
- [all gasp]

19:44.430 --> 19:48.190
- I will put it down
with a smile.

19:48.190 --> 19:49.670
Back to work, everyone!

19:49.670 --> 19:53.990
[crowd booIng]

19:53.990 --> 19:55.910
I love you too.

19:55.910 --> 19:59.310
High-fiving
a million angels.

19:59.310 --> 20:03.230
- Hey, Pete, how do I know
that the colors you see

20:03.230 --> 20:05.310
are the same
as the colors that I see?

20:05.310 --> 20:07.590
Maybe what I see as red,

20:07.590 --> 20:09.470
you perceive as green.

20:09.470 --> 20:12.110
- We should be writing
this stuff down.

20:12.110 --> 20:14.470
- Oh, I didn't think
anybody would be in here.

20:14.470 --> 20:16.550
I mean, I brought
you guys a pizza.

20:16.550 --> 20:19.190
- Lemon, think fast!

20:19.190 --> 20:21.510
- What is going on here?

20:21.510 --> 20:23.550
- Join us.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.790
Pete and I are having
a little college night.

20:25.790 --> 20:30.510
- Oh, yeah?
Want to see me shotgun this?

20:30.510 --> 20:31.910
- Oh, god,
she means the pizza.

20:31.910 --> 20:34.380
- No, she's unhinging
her jaw!

20:37.190 --> 20:39.950
- Come on,
we were just pranking Pete!

20:39.950 --> 20:41.510
How long
do we have to do this?

20:41.510 --> 20:43.830
- You wanted college
to go on forever?

20:43.830 --> 20:45.310
You got it.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
