(theme music playing)

00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.588
J‘J‘

01:35.596 --> 01:38.588
J‘J‘

02:03.791 --> 02:05.793
(sighs)

02:05.793 --> 02:08.462
Well, well, well.

02:08.462 --> 02:12.466
Look what came in the mail--
another one just waiting for me.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.834
Here I am, sorry I'm late.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.570
I had to drop some film off
at the lab,

02:16.570 --> 02:20.407
but it's Friday and I don't have
a booking until Monday,

02:20.407 --> 02:23.010
and yes, yes, yes, we have
the whole weekend together,

02:23.010 --> 02:25.846
just you guys and me.

02:25.846 --> 02:26.947
Mm!

02:26.947 --> 02:27.981
(mellowjazz playing over radio)

02:27.981 --> 02:30.684
Well, someone
must have liked us.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.119
(high-pitched voice):
"Open me, open me."

02:32.119 --> 02:34.254
I can hear you, hmm.

02:34.254 --> 02:38.525
Oh, yes, I got something
for you, Ace.

02:38.525 --> 02:41.562
Uh, uh, were you
a good dog, hmm?

02:41.562 --> 02:45.899
Did you stay quiet and not
wake up the neighbors, hmm?

02:45.899 --> 02:48.502
0h, tell me a yes.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.903
Say yes.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.205
Come on.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.006
(barks, growls)

02:53.006 --> 02:56.143
Aw... you sweet thing.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.045
Thank you for asking.

02:58.045 --> 03:01.682
Yes, I shot
bathing suits today--

03:01.682 --> 03:04.985
seven beautiful girls
in bathing suits.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.653
(chuckles)

03:06.653 --> 03:08.055
(clicking tongue)

03:08.055 --> 03:10.057
Hey, Tweety.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.617
Where's the party?

03:15.562 --> 03:17.564
(sighs)

03:17.564 --> 03:19.633
Isn't anyone going
to dance with me?

03:19.633 --> 03:23.569
Come on, to me, to Friday.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.299
To you, whomever you are.

03:29.843 --> 03:33.836
Hi, big boy, want to dance?

03:40.821 --> 03:42.823
(bump)

03:42.823 --> 03:43.824
(shushing)

03:43.824 --> 03:46.160
She's sleeping.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.890
(whispering):
Sorry.

03:54.635 --> 03:58.230
Okay, mystery man.

04:06.313 --> 04:09.483
(over TV):
Hi, Monique, l'm Scott.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.351
The dating service sent me
your tape.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.586
They thought that, well,

04:12.586 --> 04:14.254
we might like to get together.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.823
As you can see,

04:15.823 --> 04:18.192
I've got brown hair, brown eyes.

04:18.192 --> 04:20.027
I'm about six-feet-two.

04:20.027 --> 04:23.428
I guess I'm a Boston type,
education-wise.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.234
Now, the good news is:
I'm a lawyer.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.769
But the bad news is:

04:28.769 --> 04:31.338
| just don't know what to do
with all my money.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.339
(chuckles)

04:32.339 --> 04:33.407
You poor thing.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.741
SCOTT:
I'm looking for someone

04:34.741 --> 04:37.377
to spend my money on, Monique.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.847
I really like
to have a good time.

04:39.847 --> 04:44.151
I like to sail and ski,
and I really appreciate

04:44.151 --> 04:47.721
a woman who appreciates
the good life,

04:47.721 --> 04:50.257
like you, Monique.

04:50.257 --> 04:53.360
Must be nice to be so popular.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.097
And she's so very popular,
isn't she?

04:57.097 --> 05:00.601
So very, very popular.

05:00.601 --> 05:04.238
Hey, what are we going
to tell Scott?

05:04.238 --> 05:07.173
Hey, sleepy bones.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.782
Come on.

05:15.782 --> 05:20.354
We of the popular club have
a lot of work to do.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.345
Up you go.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.130
(sultry music playing)

05:38.872 --> 05:40.574
Pink.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.099
Pink is really your color.

05:45.145 --> 05:48.015
And we all know about blondes.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.108
Blondes have more f...

05:59.860 --> 06:02.329
Yes, yes, we know.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.762
You're perfect.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.808
Oh...

06:14.808 --> 06:18.745
She's beautiful,

06:18.745 --> 06:22.579
sexy, mysterious...

06:23.717 --> 06:28.484
...every little thing
a guy could want.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.692
That's it.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.855
Ah, brilliant.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.239
Hello, Scott, it's me, Monique.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.442
I received your tape today.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.611
Don't you think we ought
to get to know each other

06:51.611 --> 06:53.914
a little bit better
before we meet?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.782
Come and sit with me here.

06:55.782 --> 06:59.319
This is my secret place,
but I'll share it with you.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.621
You know how people
usually meet, Scott.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.457
They're introduced at a party.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.460
A few days later, they may see
each other at a club.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.894
They talk,

07:07.894 --> 07:09.896
decide they want to go out.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.965
They like each other's faces--

07:11.965 --> 07:13.533
just the two of them,

07:13.533 --> 07:16.236
alone...

07:16.236 --> 07:19.172
across a table...

07:19.172 --> 07:21.341
looking at each other,

07:21.341 --> 07:24.003
thinking about what lies ahead.

07:25.412 --> 07:28.582
Maybe that can be us
one day, Scott.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.818
You know how to reach me
through the dating service.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.920
Now it's up to you...

07:33.920 --> 07:36.445
when we meet again.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.129
(music fades)

07:42.129 --> 07:43.994
(clicking)

07:48.769 --> 07:51.761
Good job, kiddo.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.598
Nighty night.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.408
(dog barks)

08:11.525 --> 08:13.459
(tape inserts)

08:14.461 --> 08:16.588
(sultry music plays)

08:28.475 --> 08:30.477
(over TV):
Hi, Scott.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.145
It's me, Monique.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.045
(stops tape)

08:36.149 --> 08:38.185
What do you think, Ace?

08:38.185 --> 08:41.588
You think
Scott will video us back, hmm?

08:41.588 --> 08:43.351
(phone ringing)

08:57.938 --> 09:00.006
Jones residence, Mary speaking.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.075
Hi... Mary.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.910
Who is this?

09:03.910 --> 09:05.579
Mary, H wondered

09:05.579 --> 09:06.613
what the "M" stood for.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.815
Look, uh, I live
across the alleyway.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.806
l-l'm the guy in the window.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.790
Uh, I looked up "M. Jones"
in the phone book.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.259
l-l got your name
off the mailbox.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.556
I hope you don't mind.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.598
Uh, look, my... my name's David.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.601
Uh, ljust moved here
from Arizona.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.036
l was out, uh, covering the
farm leagues in the southwest

09:30.036 --> 09:33.707
and, uh, now I'm here
covering the big leagues.

09:33.707 --> 09:37.244
DAVID: (chuckles)
Baseball, yeah, um...

09:37.244 --> 09:40.680
I don't want to, uh,
seem too forward, but, uh,

09:40.680 --> 09:43.216
well, uh,
I don't know anyone here,

09:43.216 --> 09:46.119
and, uh, I'm tired
of eating alone and l,

09:46.119 --> 09:48.588
I wondered,
since we're neighbors,

09:48.588 --> 09:51.625
uh, would you consider
having dinner with me tonight

09:51.625 --> 09:52.692
or sometime?

09:52.692 --> 09:53.693
Me?

09:53.693 --> 09:55.195
DAVID:
Well, yeah, just dinner.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.397
Uh, we could talk, you know.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.865
Lately I've been talking
to the walls here, I...

10:04.371 --> 10:06.573
(phone rings)

10:06.573 --> 10:08.008
MARY (recording):
Please leave a message

10:08.008 --> 10:09.309
at the sound of the beep.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.544
(beep)

10:10.544 --> 10:13.380
DAVID (over machine):
Mary, uh, look, I-I'm sorry.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.616
Uh... obviously, uh,

10:16.616 --> 10:19.953
that's not the way
things are done in the city.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.757
Uh, anyway, hope I haven't blown

10:23.757 --> 10:26.393
my chances for meeting you.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.929
If you, if you'd like
to talk sometime, uh,

10:28.929 --> 10:31.097
my name's David Sticks.

10:31.097 --> 10:35.936
Number is 473-2666.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.537
G-Good night, Mary.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.528
(hangs up)

10:41.508 --> 10:44.272
(children playing in distance,
birds chirping)

10:57.891 --> 10:59.381
Larry.

11:04.898 --> 11:08.299
Let's see what kind
of a girl Larry likes.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.039
What do you think?

11:13.039 --> 11:16.109
This one for Larry? Hmm?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.844
Larry likes redheads.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.334
Yes, he does.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.693
(zoom whirring)

11:47.641 --> 11:48.972
(switch clicks)

11:57.851 --> 12:01.150
(phone ringing)

12:06.926 --> 12:08.161
MARY (recording):
Please leave a message

12:08.161 --> 12:09.362
at the sound of the beep.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.363
(beep)

12:10.363 --> 12:12.232
DAVID (on phone):
Hi, Mary. You get the tickets?

12:12.232 --> 12:13.833
Biggest game of the season
tomorrow night.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.903
You can bring a friend,
if you want.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.405
Are you there?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.307
DAVID:
Um...

12:20.307 --> 12:22.575
look, uh, I'm gonna be going
over to the stadium

12:22.575 --> 12:25.145
at about 7:00,
so if you need a ride

12:25.145 --> 12:26.546
just give me a call.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.748
That's 473-2666.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.417
(hangs up)

12:30.417 --> 12:32.419
MONIQUE:
Don't be a fool, Mary.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.254
What?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.289
You'll only make
a fool of yourself.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.156
You don't think he wants
to see you, do you?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.366
He doesn't know
he's calling you;

12:46.366 --> 12:48.268
he thinks he's calling me.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.065
Me, Mary. Me.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.641
(birds chirping, kids shouting
playfully outside)

13:07.954 --> 13:11.524
Hmm, batter, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter up!

13:11.524 --> 13:14.861
All right, sports fans.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.930
Here we are,
the count's three and two.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.531
Here comes the pitch.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.500
(clucks tongue)
Yay!

13:20.500 --> 13:22.001
All right, the runner's going.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.436
He's running to second.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.372
He slides...

13:25.372 --> 13:27.140
He's safe! Yay!

13:27.140 --> 13:29.275
(laughs)
Baseball!

13:29.275 --> 13:31.745
People talking and laughing,
being silly.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.747
Hot dogs, popcorn...

13:33.747 --> 13:36.614
-(typing in distance)
-Holy cow.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.908
(typing continues)

13:46.693 --> 13:48.094
MONIQUE:
I think he's cute.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.187
Why don't you invite him over?

13:51.865 --> 13:54.200
MONIQUE:
You like him.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.102
Shut up!

13:56.102 --> 14:00.039
MONIQUE (singsongy):
Mary, Mary, Mary's got a crush.

14:00.039 --> 14:02.175
It's too bad.

14:02.175 --> 14:06.202
Because what in the world
do you have to offer him?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.715
Well, maybe he...

14:08.715 --> 14:10.717
(doorbell buzzes)

14:10.717 --> 14:12.708
(doorbell buzzes three times)

14:15.889 --> 14:17.880
(ti m id Iy):
Who's there?

14:21.561 --> 14:23.552
Who is it?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.543
"For Mary, from David."

14:51.825 --> 14:54.694
These are for me.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.363
MARY:
It's me he wants to meet.

14:57.363 --> 14:58.998
Me.

14:58.998 --> 15:02.535
Not your long legs
and skinny waist

15:02.535 --> 15:04.871
and glassy eyes.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.206
These are for me,

15:06.206 --> 15:08.875
a real girl.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.377
MONIQUE'S VOICE:
Don't be an idiot, Mary.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.646
Lots of men have
believed I'm real.

15:13.646 --> 15:17.217
There's Scott and Larry and
everyone at the dating service.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.920
There are lots of men who are
just waiting for dates with me.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.083
Were you gonna keep those dates?

15:25.658 --> 15:28.461
MARY'S VOICE:
No, you're not real! You change!

15:28.461 --> 15:32.098
You-you change to fit whatever
you think people want you to be.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.299
I don't.

15:33.299 --> 15:34.834
I can't.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.569
I can't change.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.038
MONIQUE'S VOICE:
Don't you think those men

15:39.038 --> 15:41.674
would have been
a little disappointed?

15:41.674 --> 15:44.802
Don't you think David
will be disappointed?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.384
MARY'S VOICE:
Well...

15:51.384 --> 15:53.375
let's find out.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.725
Hi...

15:58.725 --> 16:00.454
David.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.287
It's me, Mary...

16:05.965 --> 16:07.333
...Jones.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.002
Uh...

16:10.270 --> 16:13.206
just, um...

16:13.206 --> 16:15.074
I thought we might...

16:15.074 --> 16:16.439
(groans):
Oh...

16:17.477 --> 16:18.774
(whispers):
Damn...

16:19.779 --> 16:21.610
(sighs)

16:46.039 --> 16:48.030
J‘J‘

16:58.351 --> 17:00.615
(groans)

17:05.592 --> 17:08.294
Hi, David.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.363
Um...

17:10.363 --> 17:13.299
This is, uh...

17:13.299 --> 17:17.103
Mary, and, uh...

17:17.103 --> 17:19.372
I'm...

17:19.372 --> 17:22.141
five-five...

17:22.141 --> 17:24.132
I have, uh...

17:26.312 --> 17:30.917
...hair, um,
reddish brown and...

17:30.917 --> 17:33.579
my eyes are, uh...

17:36.723 --> 17:38.758
...gray...

17:38.758 --> 17:40.860
and, um...

17:43.596 --> 17:46.429
I live alone.

17:48.635 --> 17:52.505
Hi...

17:52.505 --> 17:54.132
David.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.238
This is, um...

18:01.981 --> 18:03.505
...Mary.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.653
(voice breaking):
I...

18:06.653 --> 18:09.489
(crying quietly)

18:09.489 --> 18:11.324
(objects clatter)

18:11.324 --> 18:13.426
(Mary gasps anxiously)

18:13.426 --> 18:15.257
Hi, David.

18:16.295 --> 18:18.126
This is Mar...

18:30.810 --> 18:34.647
This isn't the person
you want to meet.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.649
(phone ringing)

18:36.649 --> 18:37.984
MARY (recording):
Please leave a message

18:37.984 --> 18:39.986
-at the sound of the beep.
-(beeP)

18:39.986 --> 18:41.187
DAVID (on phone):
Hi, Mary.

18:41.187 --> 18:42.689
Since I'm going
to the stadium anyways,

18:42.689 --> 18:45.024
let's just say I'll pick you up
tonight at 7:00,

18:45.024 --> 18:46.192
unless I hear from you.

18:46.192 --> 18:47.894
If you don't want to go,
I'll understand,

18:47.894 --> 18:49.595
and I promise
I won't bother you anymore.

18:49.595 --> 18:52.498
But I guarantee
it's gonna be a great game.

18:52.498 --> 18:55.490
So... I hope
I see you tonight, Mary.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.344
(quiet, steady dripping)

19:17.490 --> 19:20.426
(footfalls descending stairs)

19:20.426 --> 19:22.261
(knocking on door)

19:22.261 --> 19:24.593
Mary? It's David.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.766
(knocking)

19:26.766 --> 19:28.495
Mary?

19:30.970 --> 19:32.905
(traffic passing by)

19:32.905 --> 19:34.429
Mary?

19:39.846 --> 19:41.848
(toy squeaks)

19:41.848 --> 19:43.950
(chuckles softly)
Hi, Fido.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.818
Where's Mary?

19:45.818 --> 19:47.376
Mary?

19:54.427 --> 19:56.361
Mary?

19:58.397 --> 20:00.299
Okay.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.668
(sighs) Okay, I w... I won't
take this any further.

20:02.668 --> 20:05.338
Uh, I already feel like a jerk.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.607
I won't bother
you anymore, okay?

20:07.607 --> 20:10.910
There's just...
something about you. Uh...

20:10.910 --> 20:13.579
I found you... very interesting.

20:13.579 --> 20:17.116
I was watching you
move around in here,

20:17.116 --> 20:19.619
using that doll to set up
your photographs, and...

20:19.619 --> 20:20.953
I don't know, I-I thought...

20:20.953 --> 20:22.255
Who cares what I thought, right?

20:22.255 --> 20:23.589
I mean, there's such a thing

20:23.589 --> 20:26.425
as privacy, and-and
I respect that, I really do.

20:26.425 --> 20:28.628
So... sorry.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.762
-(c|attering)
-Psst!

20:29.762 --> 20:31.696
DAVID:
Mary?

20:33.466 --> 20:35.161
Where are you?

20:37.837 --> 20:39.236
Mary?

20:46.612 --> 20:47.413
(relieved sigh):
Oh...

20:47.413 --> 20:49.081
There you are.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.810
Mary, uh...

20:52.518 --> 20:54.353
...are you all right?

20:54.353 --> 20:55.342
(creaking)

20:59.926 --> 21:00.915
Psst!

21:06.666 --> 21:07.655
(door slams)

21:19.312 --> 21:22.915
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.651
Waiting for us to enter.

21:25.651 --> 21:28.888
Waiting to enter us.

21:28.888 --> 21:35.521
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
