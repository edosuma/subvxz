00:05.505 --> 00:08.473
Beckett: Castle. Are you okay?

00:08.508 --> 00:11.376
Where have you been?
Why haven't you called?

00:11.410 --> 00:12.811
I couldn't.

00:12.845 --> 00:15.480
Kate, what's going on?

00:15.515 --> 00:17.616
[Sirens wail in distance]

00:17.636 --> 00:18.931
I've got to go.

00:18.951 --> 00:20.268
No, no! No, Kate... Kate,
why are you shutting me out?

00:20.288 --> 00:21.866
Castle, I love you.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.356
Kate. Kate.

00:39.638 --> 00:41.605
Are you sure we're safe here?

00:41.640 --> 00:43.850
Am I sure? Um, no.

00:43.870 --> 00:47.107
This building was seized by
NYPD a week ago in a drug bust.

00:47.127 --> 00:49.246
There's no paperwork connecting it to me.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.287
[Sighs]

00:50.307 --> 00:53.050
We got a couple of days here. [Grunts]

00:53.084 --> 00:54.807
Not if we starve to death first.

00:54.827 --> 00:56.963
Trust me. A bullet's gonna kill
you long before hunger does.

00:56.983 --> 01:01.105
Ah. Thank you. I feel so much calmer now.

01:12.036 --> 01:15.395
This is so not how I
saw my life playing out.

01:15.415 --> 01:17.164
I joined the A.G.'S office
to make a difference,

01:17.184 --> 01:19.056
maybe impress a girl.

01:19.577 --> 01:21.511
Okay, a lot of girls.

01:21.546 --> 01:23.172
The point is I thought
I'd be saving the world

01:23.192 --> 01:26.817
from behind a computer,
not being hunted for sport

01:26.837 --> 01:29.986
by the "zero dark thirty" all-stars.

01:31.533 --> 01:34.881
Today was supposed to be my first day
as captain of the 12th precinct.

01:34.901 --> 01:38.388
Worst thing I thought I was gonna be facing
was working without Castle.

01:39.205 --> 01:41.327
<i>And then you called.</i>

01:44.442 --> 01:45.981
All right. Try to get some sleep.

01:46.001 --> 01:47.770
Yeah. Right.

[Object clatters]

[Gunfire]

03:07.033 --> 03:08.522
We have to go. Now.

03:08.542 --> 03:09.391
Who are you?

03:09.411 --> 03:12.286
Sorry, dear. There's no time for chitchat.

03:13.822 --> 03:15.609
Come on.

03:22.198 --> 03:26.066
Baker is down. I repeat, Baker is down.

03:26.101 --> 03:27.501
Target is coming to you.

03:27.535 --> 03:31.164
Charlie, acknowledge. Charlie.

03:31.772 --> 03:32.596
Get in.

03:32.616 --> 03:36.310
No. No. Not until you tell me who you are.

03:36.940 --> 03:38.359
You can call me Rita.

03:38.379 --> 03:39.646
I'm Castle's stepmother.

03:39.666 --> 03:42.382
Now, we really have to go.

03:42.417 --> 03:45.051
[Car door opens, closes]

03:45.085 --> 03:47.220
[Tires screech]

03:51.451 --> 03:52.359
So, what do we know?

03:52.393 --> 03:53.393
Last night, Beckett's old team

03:53.428 --> 03:55.429
from the Attorney
General's office was killed.

03:55.463 --> 03:56.970
Right. And then, this morning,

03:56.990 --> 03:59.836
she gets a call from
their new hire, Vikram,

03:59.856 --> 04:00.817
and all hell breaks loose.

04:00.837 --> 04:03.435
Which means everything must be connected
to Beckett's time in the A.G.

04:03.471 --> 04:04.905
But how? That was two years ago.

04:04.940 --> 04:05.905
Maybe she stayed in contact.

04:05.940 --> 04:07.708
And kept me in the dark?

04:07.742 --> 04:10.246
Well, before today, I
wouldn't have believed it.

04:10.266 --> 04:13.913
Now I can't help but wonder
what else she's keeping from me.

04:13.948 --> 04:14.914
Don't go there, dad.

04:14.949 --> 04:16.516
Easier said than done.

04:16.551 --> 04:18.665
- Richard?
- In here.

04:18.685 --> 04:21.916
Ah. I thought you two
might need a pick-me-up.

04:21.935 --> 04:24.733
Oh, and look who I found downstairs.

04:24.753 --> 04:25.763
Hey.

04:25.783 --> 04:26.560
That's funny.

04:26.594 --> 04:28.526
Last time I saw you, you said we were done.

04:28.546 --> 04:30.603
Look, I feel bad about what happened.

04:30.623 --> 04:32.031
If I'd known I could've used you as bait,

04:32.066 --> 04:34.300
I would have stuck around
and followed your kidnappers.

04:34.335 --> 04:35.335
Uh...

04:35.661 --> 04:36.725
It was a joke.

04:36.745 --> 04:38.637
- Not a very good one.
- Fair enough.

04:38.672 --> 04:40.740
- What do you want, Hayley?
- To help.

04:40.774 --> 04:43.525
I reckon that I owe you that
much after what happened.

04:43.545 --> 04:45.745
She did give us the clue that found you.

04:45.779 --> 04:48.568
Well, yeah, after Esposito
dragged her down to the precinct.

04:48.588 --> 04:49.549
You're not wrong, mother,

04:49.569 --> 04:51.484
but we do need all the help
we can get to find Beckett.

04:51.518 --> 04:52.886
I was hoping you'd say that,

04:52.920 --> 04:54.653
'cause I've already got feelers out

04:54.688 --> 04:57.280
to contacts in high-traffic
areas across the city...

04:57.300 --> 05:00.159
cab companies, banks,
hotels, train stations.

05:00.194 --> 05:01.995
I sent them pictures of Beckett and Vikram

05:02.029 --> 05:03.242
and asked them to spread them around,

05:03.262 --> 05:05.468
plus scan through their
surveillance videos.

05:05.488 --> 05:08.418
If your wife is still in
town, we will find her.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.168
Ah. Told you she was a keeper.

05:13.953 --> 05:16.275
Rita: I've been married to
Castle's father for almost 10 years.

05:16.309 --> 05:17.643
Jackson never mentioned being married.

05:17.677 --> 05:19.521
Well, of course not. It's classified.

05:19.541 --> 05:22.425
In this line of work,
you make a lot of enemies.

05:22.445 --> 05:24.212
Attachments are liabilities...

05:24.232 --> 05:25.659
leverage to be used against us.

05:25.679 --> 05:27.049
- Sounds romantic.
- Rita: It can be.

05:27.069 --> 05:29.224
Absence doesn't always
make the heart grow fonder,

05:29.244 --> 05:31.438
but it sure does wonders for the libido.

05:31.458 --> 05:34.237
I haven't seen Jackson in... Nine months.

05:34.498 --> 05:36.028
I am raring to go.

05:36.062 --> 05:37.930
- That's sweet.
- So, what are you? CIA?

05:37.964 --> 05:39.197
Oh, God. No.

05:39.232 --> 05:40.966
I'm a different three-letter agency.

05:41.000 --> 05:41.834
Much more exclusive.

05:41.868 --> 05:43.601
You actually expect me to believe that?

05:43.636 --> 05:44.702
I did save your life, dear.

05:44.737 --> 05:46.515
True that.

05:46.986 --> 05:48.974
How did you end up back there?
What's your connection to all of this?

05:49.008 --> 05:50.732
I'm afraid that's also classified.

05:50.777 --> 05:53.145
People died. Friends of mine.

05:53.179 --> 05:55.247
I know. And more may die unless you tell me

05:55.281 --> 05:57.650
everything that has
happened up until this point.

05:57.684 --> 06:00.052
Listen to me. Whatever you
think this is, it's bigger.

06:00.470 --> 06:03.321
And if you want to stay alive,
you're gonna need my help.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.778
It started this morning.

06:12.175 --> 06:14.700
I was getting ready for
work, and then he called.

06:16.034 --> 06:17.202
Wow.

[Gasps]

06:18.752 --> 06:19.787
What?

06:19.807 --> 06:21.839
That was supposed to be
a decoder ring in there.

06:21.874 --> 06:25.355
Oh, my God. This is so beautiful.

06:30.483 --> 06:31.616

06:38.123 --> 06:39.624
Of course. Please wait just one moment.

06:39.659 --> 06:42.490
Okay. I'll trade. There you go. Thanks.

06:42.510 --> 06:43.795
Yeah, this is Beckett.

06:53.171 --> 06:54.871
Understood.

Uh, you know, uh, I'm not interested,
so why don't you take me off the list?

- How?
- One was stabbed at a bar.

08:11.630 --> 08:12.982
The others were killed in a car crash.

08:13.016 --> 08:14.850
But it wasn't an accident.
They were all murdered.

08:14.885 --> 08:15.851
How do you know that?

08:15.886 --> 08:18.493
Because someone tried to
kill me yesterday, too.

08:19.088 --> 08:21.260
So, then why didn't
you pull the fire alarm?

08:21.409 --> 08:22.892
The FBI, the NSA?

08:22.926 --> 08:24.359
Because you're at the center of all this,

08:24.394 --> 08:25.782
which makes you the
only person I can trust.

those people in over a year.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.781
They tapped your phone. They
used it to track you to me.

09:55.815 --> 09:57.898
I've been shot. I need to get to a doctor,

09:57.918 --> 09:59.217
and we need to call the cavalry.

09:59.252 --> 10:00.589
That's gonna be the
last call you ever make.

10:00.609 --> 10:03.642
Look, whoever these guys are,
they are hacked in everywhere,

10:03.662 --> 10:06.669
which means anybody you
call is gonna wind up dead.

It's okay. Listen. I'm a cop.

10:22.953 --> 10:24.009
I just need a needle and thread,

10:24.043 --> 10:26.411
and I'm gonna have to detain
you for your own safety.

10:26.445 --> 10:28.406
Grab her cellphone, lock
her up in the bathroom.

10:28.426 --> 10:29.718

Headache. I'm dizzy. I-I
need to eat something.

10:39.892 --> 10:41.826
Yeah? Well, maybe you should
have grabbed some breakfast

10:41.860 --> 10:43.869
this morning instead of calling me.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.590
I'm a diabetic.

emergency at a time.

Yesterday morning, I got an
alert... [Inhales sharply]

11:15.238 --> 11:18.642
That a pending interagency database search
generated a result.

11:18.662 --> 11:20.462
Right away, I knew it was weird

11:20.496 --> 11:22.364
because the search was two years old,

11:22.398 --> 11:25.940
and it was instigated by a
former agent named Kate Beckett.

11:26.635 --> 11:28.270
What was the search for?

11:28.304 --> 11:31.586
The document it uncovered
was a just-declassified

11:31.606 --> 11:33.976
electronic memo, heavily redacted.

11:34.010 --> 11:34.977
From what I could tell,

11:35.011 --> 11:37.212
it detailed a meeting
between a federal official

11:37.247 --> 11:39.788
of some kind and senator William Bracken.

11:42.580 --> 11:43.986
[Grunts]

11:48.524 --> 11:51.341
When I started at the A.G.'S office,

11:51.361 --> 11:53.194
I ran a keyword search,

11:53.228 --> 11:55.372
hunting for criminality
connected to Bracken,

11:55.392 --> 11:56.757
and I never got a hit.

11:56.777 --> 11:58.499
Well, yesterday, you did.

11:59.611 --> 12:01.808
And five people are dead because of it.

12:20.604 --> 12:22.209
You okay?

12:26.010 --> 12:28.094
Yeah. I just...

12:28.812 --> 12:30.997
I thought I would never see him again.

12:31.017 --> 12:34.547
I thought that I'd finally
put this all behind me.

12:34.567 --> 12:38.220
I-I don't think you ever
get over something like that.

12:38.494 --> 12:41.390
It... it becomes a part of who you are.

12:43.097 --> 12:45.492
My sister died when I was a kid.

12:45.512 --> 12:49.899
I still think about her all the time.

12:51.971 --> 12:54.006
Tell me everything you
remember about the memo.

12:54.026 --> 12:57.773
Well, most of it was redacted.

12:57.807 --> 13:00.686
But... but there was a word
written in the margin...

13:00.744 --> 13:02.110
Loksat.

13:02.144 --> 13:05.447
That made me curious, so I looked it up.

13:05.482 --> 13:07.048
Came up empty, so I just...

13:07.083 --> 13:10.986
I forwarded the whole thing to Agent McCord
and forgot about it.

13:11.020 --> 13:14.322
12 hours later, they were dead

13:14.754 --> 13:17.584
and I was running for my life.

13:17.827 --> 13:20.128
Your search must have triggered an alarm.

13:20.473 --> 13:22.744
That memo was most likely
declassified by accident,

13:22.764 --> 13:24.084
and whatever Loksat is,

13:24.104 --> 13:27.803
these people will clearly do
anything to keep it a secret.

13:27.837 --> 13:30.906
[Buzzer]

13:48.123 --> 13:49.635
Detective Beckett,

13:49.655 --> 13:52.256
you are the last person I expected to see.

13:52.276 --> 13:54.353
Why is that? You thought
I'd be dead by now?

13:54.373 --> 13:56.959
I don't have the slightest
idea what you're talking about.

13:56.979 --> 13:59.067
Rachel McCord, Matt Hendricks?

13:59.101 --> 14:01.602
Five murdered federal
agents ringing a bell?

14:01.969 --> 14:02.937
Not a one.

14:02.971 --> 14:06.783
And how about this one... Loksat.

14:10.209 --> 14:11.879
How do you know about Loksat?

14:11.914 --> 14:13.047
Doesn't matter how.

14:13.081 --> 14:14.715
The question is what is it,

14:14.750 --> 14:16.807
and why is there a hit squad
running around the east coast,

14:16.827 --> 14:18.185
killing people to protect it?

14:18.220 --> 14:19.822
- We're through here.
- The hell we are.

14:19.842 --> 14:23.896
Just by being here, you've
put a target on my back.

14:24.626 --> 14:27.294
You may as well kill
yourself right now, Kate.

14:27.329 --> 14:32.132
You have stumbled onto something
which is so over your head.

14:33.178 --> 14:35.403
I am amazed you're still alive.

14:35.437 --> 14:37.004
[Slams phone]

14:43.544 --> 14:45.980
What did Beckett say that
freaked him out so much?

14:46.014 --> 14:48.916
[Rewinding]

14:48.950 --> 14:50.384
<i>How do you know about Loksat?</i>

14:50.418 --> 14:51.551
<i>Doesn't matter how.</i>

14:51.586 --> 14:53.220
<i>The question is what is it,</i>

14:53.255 --> 14:55.890
<i>and why is there a hit squad
running around the east coast,</i>

14:55.924 --> 14:57.624
<i>killing people to protect it?</i>

14:57.644 --> 14:58.691
Loksat.

14:58.711 --> 15:00.327
- Never heard of it.
- Me neither,

15:00.362 --> 15:02.129
but it clearly scares
the hell out of Bracken.

15:02.163 --> 15:03.797
Figuring out what it means is key,

15:03.831 --> 15:05.799
and that's exactly what Beckett is doing.

15:05.833 --> 15:07.823
Well, why don't we talk to
Bracken and find out?

15:07.843 --> 15:09.987
- Yeah.
- No, um, not you, Castle.

15:10.007 --> 15:11.337
You're radioactive with this guy.

15:11.372 --> 15:13.440
Yeah, you should stay here
and wait for the assistant A.G.

15:13.474 --> 15:15.842
She's on her way up from D.C.
to bring some federal muscle.

15:15.877 --> 15:17.143
Right.

15:24.519 --> 15:26.653
Hey, Alexis.

15:26.687 --> 15:27.987
I have another clue.

15:28.022 --> 15:28.855
Alexis: So do we.

15:28.890 --> 15:29.723
We?

15:29.757 --> 15:31.491
Me and Hayley. Her feelers paid off.

15:31.526 --> 15:33.359
Vikram showed up at a hotel in midtown

15:33.394 --> 15:34.593
an hour after they left the prison.

15:34.613 --> 15:36.762
- Was Beckett with him?
- I don't know. We just got here.

15:36.797 --> 15:38.264
I'll call you as soon as
we figure anything out.

15:38.299 --> 15:40.266
No, no, Alexis. I don't
want you involved in this.

15:40.301 --> 15:42.268
Dad, I can take care of myself.

15:42.303 --> 15:43.937
Alexis, no. It is too dangerous.

15:43.971 --> 15:46.806
I'm not a kid anymore,
dad. Beckett's family.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.274
I'll call you after.

15:48.309 --> 15:49.708
Alexis...

15:50.266 --> 15:51.110
Nicely done.

15:51.145 --> 15:52.345
You sure it wasn't too harsh?

15:52.379 --> 15:54.347
No, he's got to learn. You're an adult now.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.215
So, how do we do this? [Sighs]

15:57.250 --> 15:58.616
We talk to the head of security.

15:58.651 --> 16:00.485
We get a look at their video surveillance.

16:00.519 --> 16:02.387
My source told me that Vikram arrived

16:02.422 --> 16:03.989
a little before 4:00 P.M. yesterday.

16:04.023 --> 16:06.322
The question is what the
hell was he doing here?

16:14.334 --> 16:15.994
Vikram: This is a bad idea.

16:16.014 --> 16:18.303
Well, it's all we got. We
need a copy of that memo.

16:18.338 --> 16:19.971
It's the only way to get on top of this.

16:20.005 --> 16:21.623
You know they'll have wiped
the original search, right?

16:21.643 --> 16:24.990
Yeah. I also know that the A.G.
Has a triple firewall backup,

16:25.010 --> 16:27.345
which I am guessing you can hack.

16:27.379 --> 16:29.981
Well, duh, but the second
I do, it'll trip an alarm.

16:30.015 --> 16:31.758
Guys with guns are gonna come running.

16:31.778 --> 16:35.019
Which is why we are in a
public space with four exits.

16:35.053 --> 16:37.589
You are gonna get me shot.

16:38.711 --> 16:41.553
Look on the bright
side... chicks dig scars.

16:42.347 --> 16:43.849
I hate you.

16:48.630 --> 16:50.567
[Beeps]

16:57.546 --> 16:59.060
There he is.

17:01.715 --> 17:03.812
Looks like Beckett's repositioning.

17:14.549 --> 17:15.191
Sir.

17:15.226 --> 17:17.804
Can I have a shot of whiskey, please?

17:22.618 --> 17:25.268
All right, Vikram. How's it going?

17:25.301 --> 17:28.238
I'm in. Now comes the hard part.

17:28.271 --> 17:30.340
Fast forward a little.

17:33.940 --> 17:35.132
Wait.

17:41.167 --> 17:42.167
Uh-oh.

17:44.890 --> 17:46.455
Vikram, they're here. Get out.

17:46.489 --> 17:49.679
- I need more time.
- You got maybe 15 seconds.

17:59.436 --> 18:00.436
Come on.

18:01.921 --> 18:04.040
Come on, Vikram. Get out.

18:09.329 --> 18:10.329
Come on.

18:17.353 --> 18:18.537
Got it.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.265
Hayley: [Sighing] Oh.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.101
Alexis: That was close. I'll say.

18:32.135 --> 18:35.234
It's too bad we couldn't see
what was on Vikram's computer.

18:35.867 --> 18:37.394
Can you rewind a little?

18:37.580 --> 18:38.580
[Hits key]

18:39.541 --> 18:42.510
Stop.
Look in the mirror.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.384
Can I?

18:50.419 --> 18:52.353
Thanks.

19:03.153 --> 19:04.565
[Gasps] Okay.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.234
That was totally badass.

19:06.268 --> 19:08.201
[Chuckles]

19:15.508 --> 19:18.337
- Vikram: I got the memo.
- And I got them.

19:19.380 --> 19:20.775
I followed them to a warehouse,

19:20.795 --> 19:23.955
and then, not long after that,
they showed up with Castle.

19:23.975 --> 19:26.648
They were gonna torture
him, so I stepped in.

19:26.668 --> 19:28.162
And eventually, I took off

19:28.182 --> 19:30.458
and went back to that apartment
building where you found us.

19:30.492 --> 19:31.425
I'm impressed.

19:31.460 --> 19:33.883
Most people would have
been dead within hours.

19:35.029 --> 19:36.797
All right. Now it's your turn.

19:37.202 --> 19:39.032
Who are these guys and what is Loksat?

19:39.067 --> 19:40.434
I don't know exactly.

19:40.454 --> 19:42.269
What I do know is the person behind this

19:42.303 --> 19:45.853
is a very powerful and a very
dirty analyst inside the CIA.

19:45.873 --> 19:48.275
I've been trying to get an
identity for over a year,

19:48.309 --> 19:50.960
and every time I get a
lead, it just evaporates.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.813
What's this person's connection to Bracken?

19:52.847 --> 19:54.030
They were partners.

19:54.050 --> 19:55.615
As you know, the senator was working

19:55.650 --> 19:58.051
with a drug dealer by the
name of vulcan Simmons.

19:58.086 --> 20:01.054
They were using the profits
to fund Bracken's presidential campaign.

20:01.089 --> 20:03.385
I mean, you must have wondered
how they got away with it for so long.

20:03.405 --> 20:06.459
They were protected by
Bracken's mystery partner.

20:06.494 --> 20:08.775
They were using CIA resources

20:08.795 --> 20:10.396
to import the drugs into the country.

20:10.430 --> 20:11.264
Vikram: Wow.

20:11.298 --> 20:13.065
That's life imprisonment right there.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.133
That's a political nuke.

20:14.168 --> 20:17.806
That's why they're so willing
to kill to protect their anonymity.

20:20.039 --> 20:21.680
Is Bracken normally in solitary?

20:21.700 --> 20:24.423
No. After he met with Mr. Castle,
he attacked a guard.

20:24.443 --> 20:27.669
So you stuck him in the hole.
Must have figured it was his safest bet.

20:36.123 --> 20:38.357
[Cellphone vibrates]

20:44.726 --> 20:48.266
William Bracken was just killed in prison.

20:48.746 --> 20:51.204
This changes things.

20:51.224 --> 20:53.173
I'm afraid the only way that you and Vikram

20:53.193 --> 20:56.234
are gonna be able to stay
alive is if you go on the run.

20:56.254 --> 21:00.078
And one day, I hope I will be
able to root out the big bad

21:00.751 --> 21:03.181
and get the target taken off your backs.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.069
One day?

21:07.089 --> 21:08.285
Yes, dear.

21:08.320 --> 21:12.189
I'm afraid the life that you
were living yesterday is over.

21:25.554 --> 21:28.423
Detectives. I'm Allison Hyde.
We spoke on the phone.

21:28.457 --> 21:29.255
Hey.

21:29.275 --> 21:31.191
Prison was hacked into
right before the murder.

21:31.211 --> 21:33.102
Security cameras in
solitary were turned off.

21:33.128 --> 21:34.362
These guys are professional ghosts.

21:34.382 --> 21:36.764
Listen, I'm not here to
run roughshod over you.

21:36.798 --> 21:38.099
Captain Beckett is one of yours,

21:38.133 --> 21:40.484
and rescuing her is priority one.

21:40.504 --> 21:42.192
Now, where's Richard Castle?

21:42.589 --> 21:44.781
Well, we're not sure. Why?

21:44.801 --> 21:47.541
Honestly, I think he could
be our most valuable asset

21:47.575 --> 21:49.043
in locating Captain Beckett.

21:49.077 --> 21:50.878
But I need to know
whether he can be trusted.

21:50.913 --> 21:52.146
Castle loves Beckett more than anything,

21:52.180 --> 21:53.347
and he's desperate to find her.

21:53.382 --> 21:56.150
So you're confident that he's
been telling you everything?

22:01.385 --> 22:02.723
Other than Bracken's name,

22:02.757 --> 22:04.691
there's nothing actionable
in the memo itself,

22:04.726 --> 22:06.126
only the word Loksat.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.061
There's something else written after it,

22:08.095 --> 22:09.296
but it's too smudged to read.

22:09.330 --> 22:11.832
I'll try and sharpen it.

22:13.167 --> 22:17.401
2-0-1-1 a
"b" and a "d."

22:17.600 --> 22:18.906
All right. What does that mean?

22:18.940 --> 22:22.208
Uh, 2011 could be the year.

22:22.737 --> 22:24.095
I don't know what "bd" means.

22:24.115 --> 22:26.078
[Cellphone rings]

22:26.426 --> 22:28.414
It's Esposito.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.794
- Hey, what's up?
- Yo. Where are you?

22:30.814 --> 22:31.851
At the office.

22:31.885 --> 22:32.804
What are you working on?

22:32.824 --> 22:34.889
Nothing. You sidelined me, remember?

22:34.909 --> 22:37.189
Yeah, well, the assistant
A.G. is here, Allison Hyde.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.091
She wants you to come down
to the precinct immediately.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.026
- I can't.
- Castle, you were supposed to wait...

22:41.061 --> 22:43.162
look, it's gonna take me
half an hour to get there.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.097
Why don't we just jump
on a video conference?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.332
Give me a minute to dial you in.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.233
[Beeps]
[Stammers]

22:48.268 --> 22:50.369
All right. You two should get out of sight.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.537
I'm not gonna mention
we have this document.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.407
People connected to this thing
are getting killed all over the place,

22:55.442 --> 22:57.175
so no sense putting
ourselves in the cross hairs.

22:57.195 --> 22:58.243
Agreed.

22:58.278 --> 22:59.345
Thanks.

23:03.649 --> 23:05.184
<i>Mr. Castle. We never met</i>

23:05.218 --> 23:08.020
<i>when you were in D.C.,
but I read the reports.</i>

23:08.054 --> 23:09.961
<i>You helped us out of a
very tricky situation.</i>

23:09.981 --> 23:12.282
What can I say? My life
kind of depended on it.

23:12.302 --> 23:14.793
<i>Given the stakes here,
I'm going to be blunt.</i>

23:14.827 --> 23:17.095
<i>Are you currently in
contact with Captain Beckett?</i>

23:17.129 --> 23:17.996
No.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.397
<i>But she did rescue you last night.</i>

23:19.417 --> 23:21.399
Yes. And then she left me,

23:21.433 --> 23:22.772
so it's kind of a sore subject.

23:22.792 --> 23:26.770
<i>Did she happen to say anything
about the man with her, Vikram Singh?</i>

23:27.331 --> 23:28.606
No. Why?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.233
<i>When we started digging into him,</i>

23:30.253 --> 23:32.752
<i>we noticed some alarming discrepancies.</i>

23:32.772 --> 23:34.945
<i>What kind of discrepancies?</i>

23:35.420 --> 23:38.716
<i>It appears that he forged his records
to get a job with us.</i>

23:38.750 --> 23:41.802
<i>Vikram Singh is not the
man he's pretending to be,</i>

23:41.822 --> 23:45.084
<i>which means we have to assume
that he's up to no good.</i>

23:50.358 --> 23:51.995
Hey. You hungry?

23:52.331 --> 23:54.250
I've made a decision.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.833
I'm not running.

23:56.867 --> 23:58.187
- But you should.
- Are you crazy?

23:59.227 --> 24:02.144
[Chuckles] Uh, maybe,
but I owe it to Rachel and to the others,

24:02.164 --> 24:04.974
and I sure as hell am not
gonna let someone chase me away

24:05.009 --> 24:07.144
from the life that I've
worked so hard to create.

24:07.178 --> 24:08.278
Okay.

24:08.312 --> 24:12.115
Then... I'm sticking with you.

24:13.207 --> 24:14.284
A-are you sure?

24:14.318 --> 24:17.215
Because you're not exactly trained for war.

24:17.235 --> 24:20.156
Yes. I'm sure. Thank you. That was mean.

24:20.190 --> 24:22.358
I just feel like I would be safer

24:22.392 --> 24:25.528
with you than... not with you.

24:25.814 --> 24:27.597
You ready?

24:28.234 --> 24:29.498
We're staying.

24:29.978 --> 24:30.633
Worst case scenario,

24:30.668 --> 24:32.770
we're gonna smoke out the
mystery man before we die,

24:32.790 --> 24:36.005
and I am trusting you
to put him down if we do.

24:37.598 --> 24:40.710
Jackson was right. You're
a very impressive woman.

24:41.834 --> 24:43.145
Hey. When you need me,

24:43.180 --> 24:45.048
dial this number and tell the operator

24:45.082 --> 24:47.244
that you want your curtains cleaned.

24:47.951 --> 24:49.785
I'm really glad we met.

24:49.819 --> 24:51.305
And if you survive,

24:51.325 --> 24:53.589
we really must get the families together.

24:58.761 --> 25:00.229
[Door opens, closes]

25:00.263 --> 25:01.830
Just us again.

25:02.533 --> 25:04.200
What now?

25:07.274 --> 25:11.373
Now we figure out what the
hell Loksat 2011bd means.

25:11.408 --> 25:13.305
It's a product number. Serial number?

25:13.325 --> 25:15.017
- Keypad code.
- Safe-deposit box.

25:15.037 --> 25:18.679
Okay, so Loksat represents
the CIA operation

25:18.714 --> 25:22.150
used to transport drugs for
Bracken and Vulcan Simmons.

25:22.184 --> 25:23.821
So, it's a... it's a... it's a code name?

25:23.841 --> 25:26.488
Uh, maybe, but you know what?
Maybe it's something more.

25:26.522 --> 25:28.423
Maybe it's not just the
name of the operation.

25:28.457 --> 25:30.510
Maybe it's the name of
the transportation company.

25:30.530 --> 25:34.310
- A modern-day air America.
- Exactly. And 2011bd

25:34.330 --> 25:37.209
- is the tail number of an airplane.
- Tail number of an airplane.

25:43.772 --> 25:46.240
You know how to use one of these?

25:46.274 --> 25:47.508
I can figure it out.

25:47.542 --> 25:50.044
[Gun cocks]

26:06.457 --> 26:07.962
Hands where I can see them.

26:07.996 --> 26:09.630
- Come on.
- What the hell is this?

26:09.664 --> 26:11.197
We're here to talk about Loksat.

26:11.231 --> 26:12.598
Uh, what is that?

26:12.633 --> 26:14.734
An illegal CIA air fleet
used to transport drugs.

26:14.769 --> 26:16.302
We tracked a plane's tail number

26:16.336 --> 26:17.904
to this private airport and to you.

26:17.938 --> 26:19.172
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:19.206 --> 26:21.274
I'm sure you've been trained
in how to resist interrogation,

26:21.308 --> 26:22.676
so I'm gonna make this easier for you.

26:22.710 --> 26:24.711
I'm gonna start counting, and if
I make it to five, you're dead.

26:24.745 --> 26:26.212
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe
he's telling the truth.

26:26.246 --> 26:26.946
No, he's not.

26:26.981 --> 26:29.282
Who's in charge of Loksat? One.

26:29.316 --> 26:31.217
I don't know. I-I just work here.

26:31.251 --> 26:32.442
- Two.
- Beckett, come on!

26:33.320 --> 26:35.555
- Beckett, please.
- Three.

26:38.238 --> 26:39.159
Four.

26:39.193 --> 26:40.347
Okay! Okay!

26:40.367 --> 26:42.716
I'll tell you everything.

26:43.363 --> 26:44.397
[Tires screech]

26:47.121 --> 26:48.610
Beckett.

26:49.666 --> 26:50.807
Castle: Beckett!

26:50.827 --> 26:52.234
[Gunshot]

26:56.017 --> 26:57.473
Vikram, what have you done?

26:57.493 --> 26:59.589
He was reaching for a gun.
He was trying to kill you!

26:59.609 --> 27:01.809
- You can't believe him, Kate.
- Castle, what are you doing here?

27:01.844 --> 27:03.811
Isn't it obvious? I'm rescuing you.

27:03.846 --> 27:05.780
- Hayley: Rick?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:05.814 --> 27:08.283
She's cool. She's cool. She's with me.

27:09.699 --> 27:11.986
- But this guy he's not who he says he is.
- What are you talking about?

27:12.021 --> 27:15.123
The A.G.'S office got intel
that he is the mole within the agency.

27:15.158 --> 27:17.410
No, that's... that's absurd.

27:17.844 --> 27:18.893
Don't you see what's happening?

27:18.927 --> 27:22.937
Whoever is at the heart of this Loksat memo
is trying to discredit me.

27:22.957 --> 27:24.083
He's telling the truth.

27:24.103 --> 27:26.775
This guy had his gun
cocked and ready to fire.

27:26.795 --> 27:28.168
See?

27:29.459 --> 27:32.251
Beckett, please believe me.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.308
You can't trust him.

27:38.826 --> 27:41.327
- Kate.
- Yes, I can trust him, and so can you.

27:41.347 --> 27:45.486
- No. Not until we confirm...
- Castle, just shut up and kiss me.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.120
Right. Right.

27:50.659 --> 27:52.968
Uh, this is so heartwarming, you guys.

27:52.988 --> 27:54.928
Do you think you two could
finish this a little later?

27:54.962 --> 27:56.797
Right. Right. Uh, sorry.

27:56.831 --> 27:58.164
Uh... Beckett, this is Hayley.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.632
She's the one who helped me find you.

27:59.667 --> 28:01.167
Thank you for taking care of him.

28:01.201 --> 28:03.303
Yeah, it's a lot of work.
I don't know how you do it.

28:03.337 --> 28:05.971
[Chuckles] Well, best of
luck to you, Rick. I'm off.

28:06.006 --> 28:07.840
What about finding your hacker?

28:07.874 --> 28:10.310
Oh, if he's involved in whatever
the hell this is, screw him.

28:10.344 --> 28:11.778
I'm not getting paid enough.

28:11.812 --> 28:13.780
Well, um, thank you for all your help.

28:13.814 --> 28:15.247
It was... it was a pleasure.

28:15.282 --> 28:17.082
I'm happy you found her.

28:17.117 --> 28:17.788
[Chuckles]

28:17.851 --> 28:18.851
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:37.905 --> 28:40.039
- What is it?
- You tell me.

28:40.073 --> 28:42.474
- I know.
- I've got a lot of explaining to do.

28:42.494 --> 28:43.675
You lied to me.

28:43.709 --> 28:45.961
You looked me right in the eye,
and you lied to me.

28:45.981 --> 28:48.246
Why didn't you tell me about Vikram?

28:48.280 --> 28:49.873
- I couldn't.
- Come on.

28:49.893 --> 28:52.316
The A.G.'s office has
strict protocols, Castle.

28:52.351 --> 28:54.639
You're not with the A.G.'s office anymore.

28:54.659 --> 28:56.655
I did what I did to protect you.

28:56.689 --> 28:59.758
He gave me a class seven distress code.

28:59.792 --> 29:01.426
That's life or death.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.094
I mean, what did you want me to do?

29:03.128 --> 29:05.003
Tell me the truth.

29:06.008 --> 29:08.332
Come on. Do you have any
idea how worried I was?

29:08.367 --> 29:10.035
[Sighs] Yeah, I do.

29:10.069 --> 29:12.037
I was gone for 36 hours.

29:12.071 --> 29:14.873
A year ago, you were gone for eight weeks.

29:14.907 --> 29:16.207
Eight weeks.

29:16.241 --> 29:17.075
That was different.

29:17.109 --> 29:17.834
Sure was.

29:17.854 --> 29:19.844
You still don't remember what happened

29:19.879 --> 29:21.546
during six of those weeks,
and yet I trusted you.

29:21.580 --> 29:22.913
So, please, just trust me.

29:22.948 --> 29:24.715
I didn't do this to hurt you.

29:24.749 --> 29:26.417
I did it to protect you.

29:27.261 --> 29:29.120
Why am I so angry?

29:29.154 --> 29:30.854
You know what?
When the shoe was on the other foot,

29:30.889 --> 29:33.124
- I felt the same way.
- No. That's not it.

29:33.158 --> 29:35.031
It's you.

29:35.664 --> 29:37.562
Because I've... Seen this before.

29:38.927 --> 29:40.764
What is that supposed to mean?

29:42.495 --> 29:45.243
Nothing.
Just that we work better as a team.

29:46.236 --> 29:47.526
Of course we do.

29:47.546 --> 29:50.141
Yeah. Together, we can figure this out.

29:50.175 --> 29:51.595
We can figure anything
out, just like always.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.578
I know.

29:57.453 --> 29:59.317
[Sighs] Okay. No more secrets.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.490
No more secrets.

30:06.124 --> 30:07.658
Let me get this straight.

30:07.692 --> 30:09.292
So, you and Vikram here...

30:09.327 --> 30:11.996
you're being hunted by a secret death squad

30:12.030 --> 30:14.965
that's being sanctioned by
someone deep inside the CIA,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.001
and you don't want any help?

30:17.035 --> 30:18.102
Haven't you been paying attention?

30:18.136 --> 30:18.969
There is no help.

30:19.004 --> 30:21.105
Bro, the A.G.'s office has resources.

30:21.139 --> 30:22.106
It wouldn't matter.

30:22.140 --> 30:23.607
These people have the
power to pull strings,

30:23.642 --> 30:25.859
to make evidence, cases, people disappear.

30:25.879 --> 30:27.833
We can't work through the system.

30:27.853 --> 30:30.813
So, we have to work outside the system.

30:30.848 --> 30:31.881
Beckett's right.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.750
Can't fight a faceless enemy
who lives in the shadows

30:33.784 --> 30:35.351
unless we drag them out into the light.

30:35.385 --> 30:36.318
What do you mean?

30:36.353 --> 30:38.187
Whoever's behind this
memo relies on secrecy.

30:38.221 --> 30:40.156
The one and only thing that Loksat fears...

30:40.190 --> 30:41.490
Is exposure they can't control.

30:41.525 --> 30:42.324
Exactly.

30:42.359 --> 30:45.194
If we pour enough light
on this conspiracy...

30:45.228 --> 30:47.688
Then whoever's behind it
can't come after you or Vikram.

30:47.708 --> 30:49.144
Because everyone will be watching.

30:49.164 --> 30:52.006
And I know exactly how
to turn those lights on.

30:54.871 --> 30:57.272
<i>Tonight at 11:00, a live interview</i>

30:57.306 --> 30:59.180
<i>with famed mystery novelist Richard Castle</i>

30:59.200 --> 31:01.612
<i>and NYPD Captain Katherine Beckett</i>

31:01.632 --> 31:04.414
<i>with disturbing allegations
of a murderous conspiracy...</i>

31:04.434 --> 31:05.980
Beckett is in hiding right now,

31:06.014 --> 31:08.893
but I guarantee you she will
be here for this interview.

31:09.179 --> 31:13.051
- You're not gonna regret this.
- Thanks for the exclusive, Rick.

31:13.559 --> 31:15.022
I got eyes on Castle.

31:15.057 --> 31:16.375
Oh, no.

31:17.827 --> 31:20.027
Don't worry. They won't
be making that interview.

31:20.062 --> 31:21.563
Vikram: This is a stupid plan.

31:21.597 --> 31:23.237
We should definitely rethink it.

31:23.684 --> 31:25.500
[Gun cocks] It's our only play, Vikram.

31:25.954 --> 31:28.169
All right. The live
interview is set up for 11:00.

31:28.204 --> 31:29.636
We should be there by 10:30.

31:29.671 --> 31:30.620
Castle!

31:30.640 --> 31:33.074
Drop it. Drop your weapon!

31:33.350 --> 31:35.261
- Put it down.
- Okay!

31:39.915 --> 31:41.281
Walk.

31:43.290 --> 31:48.189
Lady, I have never worked so hard
to kill one person in my entire life.

31:51.760 --> 31:54.195
[Electricity crackles]

31:58.516 --> 32:00.367
Castle: Okay, so, did you guys get lost,

32:00.401 --> 32:03.393
or were you just waiting
till the last possible second to save us?

32:03.413 --> 32:07.040
Little distracted in there.
You got a fully stocked bar, satellite TV.

32:07.074 --> 32:09.943
We ordered some Sushi on your credit card,
so I hope you don't mind.

32:09.977 --> 32:10.998
We got to get the phone.

32:11.018 --> 32:13.079
It'll tell us who's
been giving them orders.

32:13.114 --> 32:14.281
[Grunts]

32:14.315 --> 32:16.516
[Beeping]

32:17.042 --> 32:18.285
It's encrypted.

32:18.319 --> 32:19.821
Can you crack it?

32:20.107 --> 32:21.788
This is military-grade encryption.

32:21.822 --> 32:23.441
- It's... it's gonna take a while.
- Well, work fast.

32:23.461 --> 32:25.324
It's the only link we have to Loksat.

32:27.834 --> 32:29.770
Hayley: Hey, guys.

32:30.614 --> 32:33.098
So, a funny thing happened
on the way to the airport.

32:34.834 --> 32:36.435
[Guns cock]

32:36.675 --> 32:39.772
Drop the hardware. Now.

33:15.508 --> 33:17.075
Aah!

33:22.184 --> 33:24.182
[Gasps]

33:24.216 --> 33:25.449
[Coughing]

33:27.782 --> 33:29.458
You are so cool.

33:35.712 --> 33:38.029
I'll call you when we get to D.C.

33:38.548 --> 33:40.865
Just promise me this... no deals.

33:41.216 --> 33:42.433
Find out who they really are

33:42.467 --> 33:45.102
and use that to uncover
whoever's behind the Loksat memo.

33:45.137 --> 33:46.603
Five of my agents are dead.

33:46.638 --> 33:49.306
Believe me, I'm getting
the bastard responsible.

33:49.341 --> 33:51.975
But I recommend you keep a
security detail at all times.

33:52.009 --> 33:53.377
The A.G.'s office can provide the team.

33:53.411 --> 33:55.813
She's... she's already got one.

33:57.220 --> 34:00.016
Any chance I could interest
you in a return to Washington?

34:00.051 --> 34:01.852
I could offer a prestigious command.

34:01.886 --> 34:03.620
She's already got one of those, too.

34:03.655 --> 34:06.790
Uh, thank you, Ms. Hyde,
but I'm happy here.

34:06.825 --> 34:08.359
Okay.

34:11.023 --> 34:14.290
Uh, everyone, can you, uh,
gather 'round for just one second?

34:14.310 --> 34:16.139
Gather 'round. Gather
'round. Gather 'round.

34:16.159 --> 34:18.467
- Come on over here.
- What are you doing?

34:18.502 --> 34:22.405
Um, although she is a little
bit late reporting to duty,

34:22.438 --> 34:25.404
let us give an official
welcome to her first command,

34:25.424 --> 34:28.178
Captain Kate Beckett.

34:28.212 --> 34:31.214
[Cheers and applause]

34:31.248 --> 34:33.783
Speech. Speech, Captain! Speech!

34:36.286 --> 34:39.521
You know, I thought I would be
spending my first few days here

34:39.554 --> 34:41.357
with my head buried in paperwork,

34:41.391 --> 34:43.391
but so much for that. Um...

34:43.426 --> 34:46.475
It's an honor to be here,

34:46.495 --> 34:49.902
especially considering all of the captains
that have come before me.

34:49.922 --> 34:53.831
And if I was a poet or
a best-selling novelist,

34:53.851 --> 34:56.838
then maybe I'd have a
better metaphor, but, um,

34:56.873 --> 35:01.343
the 12th precinct...
she's our home, our haven.

35:01.378 --> 35:04.446
And even if she is beaten down or shot up,

35:04.480 --> 35:06.247
she's still special.

35:06.282 --> 35:08.618
Because this is where we
get to make a difference,

35:08.638 --> 35:11.575
and I am so privileged
to be able to do just that

35:11.595 --> 35:14.556
with each and every one of you.

35:17.855 --> 35:20.395
So, that being said,

35:20.430 --> 35:23.565
stop standing around doing nothing
and get back to work.

35:23.599 --> 35:24.633
[Chuckles]

35:24.667 --> 35:25.967
Guys.

35:26.001 --> 35:27.969
I cracked the phone's encryption.

35:28.003 --> 35:30.472
The shooters received
calls from only one number.

35:30.506 --> 35:32.540
- Are you able to trace it?
- I already did.

35:32.574 --> 35:35.472
It's a government cell
registered to Allison Hyde.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.582
Yeah, lock down the building.

35:42.616 --> 35:45.785
Don't let anyone from the A.G.'s office...

35:47.524 --> 35:49.112
they're gone.

35:58.274 --> 35:59.566
Thanks.

35:59.586 --> 36:02.334
ESU intercepted Hyde's
team outside of Newark.

36:02.354 --> 36:03.899
They confirm that she should be here.

36:03.919 --> 36:06.714
If she ain't, she's in the wind.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.592
[Gunshot]

36:11.612 --> 36:13.187
NYPD!

36:23.231 --> 36:24.009
Clear.

36:24.029 --> 36:24.939
Clear.

36:24.959 --> 36:26.333
Clear.

36:32.521 --> 36:34.258
[Sighs] You know what I don't get...

36:34.278 --> 36:35.799
with her power, her means,

36:35.819 --> 36:38.231
why... why didn't she
run, flee the country,

36:38.251 --> 36:39.249
go into hiding?

36:39.269 --> 36:40.947
She may have had her reasons.

36:45.341 --> 36:47.066
Should we call the feds?

36:47.301 --> 36:51.049
No. This one's ours. Let's get to work.

36:51.069 --> 36:52.898
[Beep]

36:54.027 --> 36:55.854
[Siren wails in distance]

36:57.517 --> 36:58.731
Beckett.

36:58.765 --> 36:59.998
Yeah?

37:00.033 --> 37:01.538
Is this really over?

37:05.839 --> 37:08.607
[Wind whistles]

37:14.815 --> 37:16.329
[Knock on door]

37:16.349 --> 37:17.114
Hey.

37:17.134 --> 37:19.984
Hey. Just wanted to say goodbye.

37:20.018 --> 37:21.920
It's been fun working with you.

37:21.954 --> 37:23.232
You too.

37:23.543 --> 37:26.322
- Where are you headed?
- Chicago. And then Denver.

37:26.342 --> 37:28.727
Gonna be living out of a
suitcase for the next few weeks,

37:28.747 --> 37:32.735
eating room service, watching
bad reality television...

37:32.755 --> 37:34.336
you know, my life.

37:34.356 --> 37:38.102
Well, maybe I can call you
sometime if I need some advice.

37:38.369 --> 37:40.304
Or to talk about "The Bachelor."

37:40.339 --> 37:42.054
I'd like that.

37:48.513 --> 37:50.146
[Sighs]

37:59.057 --> 38:02.292
So, do you need a lift,
or are you just checking in on me?

38:03.013 --> 38:05.796
I'm happy you're alive.

38:14.371 --> 38:17.740
So, do you believe that Allison Hyde
masterminded all of this?

38:17.774 --> 38:20.042
Of course not. Neither do you.

38:20.076 --> 38:21.919
Hyde was a convenient scapegoat.

38:21.939 --> 38:24.647
The person behind the Loksat
memo is still out there,

38:24.681 --> 38:25.543
still thriving.

38:25.563 --> 38:27.683
- So, what should we do?
- We?

38:28.062 --> 38:30.227
No. I'm gonna ferret
out that son of a bitch.

38:30.247 --> 38:33.322
You are gonna go home to that
good-looking husband of yours.

38:36.308 --> 38:38.093
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

38:38.128 --> 38:40.187
- I can't.
- Why not?

38:40.696 --> 38:43.580
What is this obsession in the heart of you?

38:43.600 --> 38:46.200
Your mother's murder's been avenged.

38:48.270 --> 38:50.471
I thought I put it all behind me.

38:51.148 --> 38:54.560
But it's back, and it's stronger than ever.

38:54.580 --> 38:58.408
A devil like that is very hard to cast out.

39:00.249 --> 39:02.450
But you have to try.

39:02.484 --> 39:04.959
Don't you see the gift
that you've been given?

39:04.979 --> 39:07.223
Allison Hyde was a patsy.

39:07.243 --> 39:09.357
Loksat will leave you alone.

39:09.625 --> 39:11.462
Don't end up like me.

39:11.482 --> 39:13.861
Go. Live your life.

39:13.895 --> 39:16.318
Friends of mine were killed because of me.

39:16.338 --> 39:17.782
Their deaths weren't your fault, Kate.

39:17.802 --> 39:20.781
- Surely you must see that.
- Still, I got to do something.

39:20.801 --> 39:22.419
And you know, maybe in doing it,

39:22.439 --> 39:24.542
that'll give me peace and
I'll be able to move on.

39:24.562 --> 39:25.958
Do you love Castle?

39:25.978 --> 39:26.874
Yeah.

39:26.908 --> 39:28.874
Then why do you want to get him killed?

39:29.184 --> 39:31.939
Have you forgotten why
I never see my husband?

39:31.959 --> 39:34.115
Attachments are liabilities,

39:34.149 --> 39:36.750
leverage to be used
against us by our enemies.

39:36.785 --> 39:37.751
So I have to choose

39:37.786 --> 39:39.574
between finding the
killer and being with Rick?

39:39.594 --> 39:42.557
- That's ridiculous.
- That's the job.

39:43.737 --> 39:46.827
Five people were killed
because of a redacted memo.

39:47.294 --> 39:50.330
What do you think is gonna
happen if Loksat finds out

39:50.364 --> 39:53.288
that you and Castle are
working together on this?

39:53.809 --> 39:55.130
You're a big girl.

39:55.150 --> 39:57.471
Dive down the rabbit hole if you must.

39:57.505 --> 40:00.107
But think twice about
who you bring with you,

40:00.141 --> 40:02.375
because unlike McCord and her team,

40:02.395 --> 40:05.946
anybody who dies now...
that blood is on you.

40:29.368 --> 40:30.302
Hey!

40:30.337 --> 40:31.938
How about breakfast for dinner?

40:31.972 --> 40:33.385
I'm making s'morlettes,

40:33.405 --> 40:35.574
which is technically
dessert for dinner, but we...

40:37.152 --> 40:38.811
You going somewhere?

40:39.287 --> 40:40.513
[Sighs] I'm sorry.

40:42.613 --> 40:44.673
I love you so much.

40:46.150 --> 40:47.606
What are you doing?

40:47.626 --> 40:49.369
I have to go.

40:49.389 --> 40:50.455
Why?

40:50.489 --> 40:53.725
I-I have to get my head right.
I have to figure some things out

40:53.760 --> 40:55.304
so that...

40:55.324 --> 40:57.967
We can have a happily ever after.

40:58.985 --> 41:00.976
Where is this coming from?

41:01.768 --> 41:04.736
Is this because of your A.G. Team?

41:04.771 --> 41:06.659
Is it Bracken?

41:07.863 --> 41:09.708
Why are you giving up on our marriage?

41:09.742 --> 41:10.709
I-I'm trying to save it.

41:10.743 --> 41:12.351
By leaving me?

41:16.582 --> 41:20.317
Look, if you have a
problem, we have a problem.

41:20.337 --> 41:21.586
That's how this works.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.154
No, Castle. Not this time.

41:23.189 --> 41:24.389
Whatever it is, Beckett,

41:24.423 --> 41:25.990
we can figure it out.

41:26.334 --> 41:28.295
Like always.

41:29.598 --> 41:31.329
[Voice breaking] Rick, do you trust me?

41:31.363 --> 41:32.730
Of course.

41:32.764 --> 41:34.699
I need you to trust me now.

41:34.733 --> 41:36.515
I have to do this on my own.

41:36.773 --> 41:39.704
And when it's done, I
just... I hope that...

41:40.235 --> 41:42.440
I hope that... I hope you'll
have room in your heart

41:42.474 --> 41:44.184
to take me back.

41:44.643 --> 41:47.044
You know, before Bracken was killed,

41:47.436 --> 41:51.582
he told me you'd never be
happy just being my wife.

41:52.598 --> 41:53.417
Please do not tell me

41:53.451 --> 41:55.173
that son of a bitch knew
you better than I do.

41:55.193 --> 41:57.021
I love you.

41:57.055 --> 41:58.355
I always will.

41:58.389 --> 41:59.976
Forgive me.

42:08.566 --> 42:11.068
