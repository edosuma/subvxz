I mean we work together here-

01:50.310 --> 01:51.679
Frankie. Excuse me.

01:51.713 --> 01:53.615
Hi. How are you?

01:53.648 --> 01:56.450
I couldn't help but notice
that you touched your hair

01:56.483 --> 01:58.720
and then you touched the glass
right afterwards.

01:58.753 --> 02:02.924
This isn't a fucking barn and
it's also not rocket surgery.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.458
- I'm sorry.
- Rocket surgery?

02:04.491 --> 02:06.126
What's rocket surgery?

02:08.128 --> 02:10.497
Can you please straighten
your body and get back to work?

02:10.531 --> 02:11.365
Thank you.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.203

Hi, it's mama.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.849
You never pick up the phone.

03:01.883 --> 03:03.518
Have you been drinking?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.520
I think you should come home
if you're not

03:05.553 --> 03:07.855
going to school and you're
just making those weird videos.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.368
I'm sorry?

03:22.904 --> 03:24.706
I can't understand you
through the-

03:24.739 --> 03:25.707
I said...

03:27.709 --> 03:29.209
Oh.
You filming me?

03:29.242 --> 03:30.410
- No, I-
- Come clean.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.113
No, I'm...

03:32.146 --> 03:35.149
You were in the frame,
but I was filming the...

03:35.183 --> 03:36.651
There's all these people
and there's this painting

03:36.684 --> 03:37.952
just hanging there.

03:37.985 --> 03:38.820
Can I see?

03:39.821 --> 03:40.588
Uh...

03:40.621 --> 03:41.455
Yeah.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.033
Yeah, no, that's kinda great.

03:52.066 --> 03:52.900
Thank you.

03:54.202 --> 03:55.570
All right,
you gotta hold my cheese

03:55.603 --> 03:56.938
and you gotta take care
of my head.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.841
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

04:01.175 --> 04:04.078
Hey folks, can I, can I have
everybody's attention please?

04:04.112 --> 04:05.847
On the wall behind me,

04:05.880 --> 04:08.315
it's not just a pretty picture
to distract you

04:08.348 --> 04:11.451
while you're waiting in line
to take a shit.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.254
And to be honest,
the way that you guys are

04:14.287 --> 04:17.058
treating this painting
is upsetting my friend.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.627
This is a man's soul right here.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.195
Yeah.

04:21.229 --> 04:24.632
And he's,
he's bearing it in the hopes

04:24.665 --> 04:28.236
that for a split second,
you will go beyond your own lives.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.672
Go beyond your need
to just buy things.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.776
So ladies and gentlemen...

04:36.911 --> 04:37.745
This is...

04:39.279 --> 04:40.480
This is a way out.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.217
You know?

04:44.252 --> 04:45.186
Ah, ha ha ha ha, ho!

04:45.219 --> 04:47.021
So eat it up.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.791
Don't eat shoes.
Don't eat skateboards.

04:49.824 --> 04:53.094
Don't eat nail polish.
Eat the art.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.662
Eat the art! Eat the art!

04:54.695 --> 04:56.130
Eat the art!

04:56.164 --> 04:57.430
It tastes good.
It tastes really good.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.866
Eat the art.

04:58.900 --> 05:00.234
All together now.

05:00.268 --> 05:01.269
Eat the art.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.970
Eat the art, eat the art,

05:03.004 --> 05:05.039
eat the art, eat the art,

05:05.072 --> 05:06.473
eat the art.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.742
They don't want you
to hear this,

05:07.775 --> 05:09.777
they want you to keep shopping!

05:42.210 --> 05:43.544
Was that a smile?

05:45.279 --> 05:46.714
No.

05:46.747 --> 05:47.715
No, I just have something
in my eye.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.349
Will you look at it?

05:49.382 --> 05:50.718
I really think I have
something in my eye.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.352
- Ew, ew.
- No, don't you see it?

05:52.385 --> 05:53.721
Is it an eyelash
or like a bug or something?

05:53.754 --> 05:54.589
- Do you see-
- So fucking gross.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.090
Hey Frankie.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.357
Romeo.

05:57.390 --> 05:58.326
You done flirting?

05:59.160 --> 06:01.428
Uh, Judy needs you to sub in.

06:01.461 --> 06:02.462
What?

06:02.495 --> 06:03.664
For her act tonight.

06:03.698 --> 06:05.032
The baby's not coming, so...

06:07.068 --> 06:07.869
That's pretty rough.

06:07.902 --> 06:08.936
No.

06:08.970 --> 06:09.837
Shots.

06:09.871 --> 06:11.138
No.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.374
Let's get weird.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.622
Wasn't he wonderful?

06:27.655 --> 06:28.623
Oh my gosh.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.558
I'm so happy to see you.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.026
Hello, I'm Judy and this is

07:48.436 --> 07:49.937

07:49.971 --> 07:51.272

07:51.305 --> 07:53.374
- Hollywood and Ivar?
- Yeah.

07:53.407 --> 07:54.575

07:54.608 --> 07:56.243

07:56.277 --> 07:57.712
Okay.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.146
No, not yet!
Yo, wait, we're walkin'!

All right, show me your best.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.834
Not bad.

08:19.867 --> 08:23.070
How did I do, cockroach man?

08:23.104 --> 08:24.605
That was...

08:25.673 --> 08:28.309
That's a five.
Ah, come on.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.176
Five?

08:36.717 --> 08:37.651
What do you call this?

08:37.685 --> 08:38.853
It's a jack knife.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.054
- A jack knife?
- Yup.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.357
And what do you call
that cockroach costume?

08:44.892 --> 08:45.860
That's my day job.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.763
Think you can do better?

08:48.796 --> 08:51.832
Uh, yes.

08:51.866 --> 08:52.700
Hey.

08:55.236 --> 08:56.871
Oh!

Yeah!

09:01.142 --> 09:02.209
Seriously?

09:02.243 --> 09:03.677
It's like a five.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.446
What am I gonna say?
It's a five.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.381
I filmed your speech
and I posted it on YouTube

09:07.415 --> 09:09.784
and it's doing really well.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.318
Like really, really,
really well,

09:11.352 --> 09:14.055
and it's already got like,
2000 views.

09:15.256 --> 09:16.891
Uh, is that a lot?

09:16.924 --> 09:18.726
For me, yeah.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.361
I only have like, you know,
barely 100 subscribers.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.862
I don't know,
people are commenting things

09:21.896 --> 09:23.197
and it's all really positive
and...

09:24.498 --> 09:25.332
That's good.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.006
How was that?

09:32.039 --> 09:33.107
That's a seven.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.976
Sammy, time to go.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.378
Say goodbye to your friend Link.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.246
But we're not finished.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.182
That's all right,
we'll finish later.

Okay?

09:46.754 --> 09:47.955
Thanks for watching her.

09:48.856 --> 09:49.857
Yeah, sure.

09:52.893 --> 09:53.961
Good for you.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.401
I'd like to give you
my information

10:00.434 --> 10:03.404
so that if you want
to find me, you can.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.406
I work at Magic Alley Bar.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.076
Is that a bar for magicians?

10:09.110 --> 10:10.911
No, it's, sometimes
there are magicians there

10:10.945 --> 10:12.379
but it's just a regular bar.

10:12.413 --> 10:13.981
It's not even that far
from here.

10:16.551 --> 10:19.019
Oh, I'm gonna check
roach man's schedule.

10:19.053 --> 10:19.920
He's a busy guy.

10:21.222 --> 10:23.124
Okay, I'm gonna put it
in your shoe.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.077
I don't get people's taste
anymore.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.378
People don't have taste anymore.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.813
They are just horny.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.283
Well that really depressing.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.653
Makes me wanna cry.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.489
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.224
You know what else
makes me really sad?

10:57.258 --> 10:59.059
Well hello boys and girls.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.395
Don't you just love feathers
and bells?

11:03.464 --> 11:04.265
I'm hungry.

11:04.298 --> 11:05.266
You little baby.

11:05.299 --> 11:06.500
She needs her milk.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.169
Nice, warm milk.

11:08.202 --> 11:10.437
Goo goo goo goo goo.

11:10.471 --> 11:11.640
Yes.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.008
Oh, wait, something smells.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.442
That could be some gas.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.647
Burp, baby, burp.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.515
- Some gas.
- Stop!

11:20.549 --> 11:21.415
Whoa!

11:21.448 --> 11:22.651
What the?

11:22.683 --> 11:24.952
Stop, stop!

11:24.985 --> 11:26.153
Let me see this.

11:26.187 --> 11:27.421
I'm gonna get you out of here.

11:27.454 --> 11:28.856
- Trust me.
- The gas man.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.859
Oh! Listen up,
you motherfudgers!

11:33.227 --> 11:35.496
Whoa.

11:35.530 --> 11:37.599
This shit isn't funny.

11:37.632 --> 11:39.333
- Hey!
- This shit's just mean.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.869
Yo, let the old lady
finish her act, you freak.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.638
Oh, yo, you want to come up

11:43.672 --> 11:45.272
and suck on the bottle
while everybody laughs?

11:45.306 --> 11:48.108
Be my guest, you Nazi cracker!

11:48.142 --> 11:49.176
Nazi cra....

11:50.311 --> 11:52.980
Hey! Take your ass back

Oh, look, he knows how to run!

11:59.486 --> 12:01.021
Fuck.

12:10.431 --> 12:12.534
That's Hollywood,
when even the bugs

12:12.567 --> 12:14.235
love the spotlight.

12:17.706 --> 12:18.806

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.074
I got it. I got it.

Oh my God.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.401
You do know that they pay me
to do that.

12:48.570 --> 12:49.403
Well...

12:54.475 --> 12:55.543
Well, you didn't seem like
you were enjoying yourself.

13:03.150 --> 13:06.887
So is uh,
is that kinda your thing?

13:06.920 --> 13:09.056
To dress up in animal costumes?

13:09.089 --> 13:10.257
Uh...

13:11.425 --> 13:12.259
Well, you know,

13:14.228 --> 13:17.231
if you're in a costume it's
easier to spot the other freaks.

13:21.636 --> 13:23.270
Can I film you?

13:23.304 --> 13:25.507
Uh, sure, weirdo.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.076
Oh.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.045
If you clean me up right here.

13:31.078 --> 13:34.582
Okay.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.454
- Right here?
- Yeah.

13:40.487 --> 13:45.492
Okay.

14:06.548 --> 14:10.585
Will you tell me
why you don't like cell phones?

14:10.618 --> 14:12.821
Will you tell me
why you don't smoke crack?

14:14.221 --> 14:17.291
This is why.
'Cause where are you?

14:18.192 --> 14:19.426
I'm right here.

14:19.460 --> 14:20.294
Nah, you gotta kick the habit.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.830
Hey. That's mine.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.030
Hey, hey, hey.
Please give that back.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.032
Hey.

14:27.502 --> 14:29.671
Oh!

14:32.973 --> 14:34.709
- Do you eat peanuts?
- What?

14:34.743 --> 14:36.210
Can you eat peanuts?

14:36.243 --> 14:37.378
There's a lot of peanuts
in Thai food.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.849
I'm gonna be at the Thai place
on Bronson tomorrow

14:40.881 --> 14:41.882
if you want to come.

14:42.717 --> 14:43.818
Noon.

14:43.852 --> 14:44.686
Okay.

14:45.553 --> 14:47.388
My name is Link, by the way.

14:50.090 --> 14:50.891
Here comes your baby.

14:50.924 --> 14:51.760
Wait.

14:52.660 --> 14:53.628
Fuck!

14:53.661 --> 14:54.629
Wow, she caught it.

14:54.662 --> 14:56.330
The crowd goes wild.

14:57.565 --> 14:58.399
Asshole.

15:03.337 --> 15:04.506
That's crazy.

15:04.539 --> 15:05.472
What the...

15:05.507 --> 15:06.508
Ooh.

15:06.541 --> 15:07.575
Wee-ooh.

15:07.609 --> 15:08.409
Ooh.

15:08.442 --> 15:09.276
Whoa, Whoa.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.044
What the?

15:12.413 --> 15:13.914
Magic.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.382
Wow.

15:15.416 --> 15:16.851
So, what,
do you come here often?

15:16.885 --> 15:18.218
No, please. Please talk to me.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.153
Talk to me. Talk to me.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.020
Please come back.

15:21.623 --> 15:23.090
Just for a little bit.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.559
All right,
what do you wanna know?

15:27.127 --> 15:28.530
Tell me about your parents.

15:28.563 --> 15:29.396
They're dead.

15:30.532 --> 15:31.331
Really?

15:31.365 --> 15:32.834
Yeah.

15:32.867 --> 15:33.735
I'm really sorry.

15:33.768 --> 15:34.636
It's all right.

15:35.936 --> 15:36.905
It was a long time ago.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.542
Measles.

15:40.575 --> 15:42.176
Measles?

15:42.209 --> 15:44.278
It was the Civil War,
so, you know.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.115
Did your parents really die
or are you...

15:48.148 --> 15:49.383
Yeah.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.753
Okay, so tell me this.

15:51.786 --> 15:53.555
How does that feel?

15:53.588 --> 15:55.122
Okay.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.558
Yeah.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.298
Why don't you say something
really profound and moving,

16:04.331 --> 16:05.733
just like that?

16:05.767 --> 16:07.234
Come on, you can do it.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.870
No, but seriously.

16:08.903 --> 16:10.672
What do you wanna do
with your life, Frankie?

16:13.741 --> 16:15.375
I don't know.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.144
Okay, well, if you did know,
what would it be?

16:17.177 --> 16:18.780
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm doing right now.

16:18.813 --> 16:22.282
I don't know what I want to do.
I don't know.

16:22.316 --> 16:24.117
You want to make art?

16:24.151 --> 16:25.553
Sure, I want to make art.

16:25.587 --> 16:26.987
Wow.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.823
That's great.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.424
All right, well what kind
of stuff you want to make?

16:30.457 --> 16:32.560
I don't know.

16:32.594 --> 16:36.296
I want to make things that
make other people feel things.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.834
All right.
Tell me about that scar.

16:45.005 --> 16:45.874
Why'd you do that?

16:47.007 --> 16:48.843
It's beautiful.
It's a part of you.

16:48.877 --> 16:50.678
All right.
The intimacy levels are too high.

16:50.712 --> 16:51.546
Abort mission.

16:54.649 --> 16:56.183
Did you even watch
the video I posted?

16:56.216 --> 16:57.752
No.

16:57.785 --> 16:59.988
People really responded to it.
To you.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.924
You don't even know
how hard it is

17:02.957 --> 17:04.458
to get views on the internet.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.829
Will you just look
at the comments?

17:14.368 --> 17:16.838
"The only thing in doubt
about your speech

17:16.871 --> 17:19.039
is whether it makes me
want to puke

17:19.072 --> 17:21.141
or kill myself and then puke."

17:21.174 --> 17:22.644
That's...

17:22.677 --> 17:24.211
They signed it
sincerely everyone.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.880
That's so sweet.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.515
Thank you for showing me that.

17:27.549 --> 17:28.950
There are more positive ones
than nasty ones.

17:28.983 --> 17:30.018
All right,
so what do you wanna do?

17:30.050 --> 17:31.251
Do you want to make art,

17:32.319 --> 17:35.422
or do you want to chase affirmation
from faceless strangers?

17:43.998 --> 17:45.533
Both.

17:45.567 --> 17:46.701
Get out of my house.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.737
I'm moving in.

17:49.771 --> 17:51.706
There's not enough space
for two.

17:51.739 --> 17:52.574
See.

17:53.841 --> 17:55.242
It's super cramped.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.578
It actually kind of works.

What are you doing?

19:11.519 --> 19:12.720
Trying to keep a low profile.

19:12.754 --> 19:14.388
They don't much like me here.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.590
Remember?

19:15.623 --> 19:16.524
You got a phone?

19:19.761 --> 19:21.395
I thought phones
were crack cocaine.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.831
Well, to defeat the beast,
first you gotta

19:23.865 --> 19:24.732
get inside its belly.

19:24.766 --> 19:25.600
Look...

19:27.635 --> 19:29.202
I'm gonna cut to the chase, kid.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.607
I think you got potential.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.641
I wanna make your next picture.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.111
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:39.947 --> 19:41.015
What? Now?

19:41.049 --> 19:41.683
Yeah, right now, let's go.

19:41.716 --> 19:42.917
No.

19:42.950 --> 19:43.918
I'm in the middle of my shift.

19:43.951 --> 19:45.019
Eh, fuck your shift.

19:45.953 --> 19:47.254
Come on.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.756
Not everyone can fuck the shift.

19:48.790 --> 19:50.658
Some people have
to go to their shifts.

19:50.692 --> 19:52.660
Some people.
You want to be those some people?

19:52.694 --> 19:53.761
No.

19:53.795 --> 19:55.228
You wanna be what then?

19:56.463 --> 19:58.099
The other kind of person.

19:58.132 --> 19:59.734
So show me. Fuck the shift.

20:00.702 --> 20:01.869
Fuck the shift.

20:01.903 --> 20:02.704
Fuck the shift.

20:02.737 --> 20:03.705
Fuck this place.

20:03.738 --> 20:05.305
Fuck this place.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.874
Fuck dressing up
in a fucking baby costume.

20:06.908 --> 20:08.109
Yeah, yeah.

20:08.142 --> 20:08.943
Fuck people who shit in sinks.

20:08.976 --> 20:10.044
Fuck people who-

20:10.078 --> 20:11.278
- Wait, wh...
- Yeah.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.380
Fuck my boss, fuck my uniform.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.414
Okay, let's go.

20:16.517 --> 20:18.052
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.554
Whoa, where's your car?

20:19.587 --> 20:20.521
I sold it.

20:20.555 --> 20:21.354
I had to pay rent.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.222
Are you serious?

20:22.255 --> 20:24.357
Mhm. Let's go.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.194
Uh...

20:31.231 --> 20:33.500
Three, two, one, blast off.

20:33.534 --> 20:36.003
Whoa, watch the pole,
watch the pole.

20:36.037 --> 20:37.739
On to the new world!

20:42.543 --> 20:43.678
What if I covered your eyes?

20:43.711 --> 20:44.746
I'd be like don't cover my eyes.

20:44.779 --> 20:46.379
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:54.622 --> 20:55.455
What have I done?

20:59.292 --> 21:02.262
You did an amazing thing.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.665
I walked out on my job.

21:04.699 --> 21:08.536
I have no money
and no idea how to get any.

21:10.571 --> 21:11.773
This is the beginning.

21:12.707 --> 21:14.041
Of unemployment.

21:14.075 --> 21:15.275
No.

21:15.308 --> 21:18.179
Well, yeah, but of everything.

21:18.212 --> 21:20.081
Now you could just
concentrate on your art.

21:20.114 --> 21:21.082
Mhm.

21:21.115 --> 21:22.315
That's a great idea.

21:23.785 --> 21:25.219
What are you doing?

21:27.088 --> 21:27.989
I'm uncomfortable.

21:30.725 --> 21:31.559
Get out.

21:33.094 --> 21:34.494
We gotta cast demons out.

21:35.563 --> 21:36.864
- Gotta get the demons out.
- No, no, no, no.

21:36.898 --> 21:38.298
That's dumb.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.534
- No demons.
- Yeah, no, it's dumb.

21:39.567 --> 21:40.935
You gotta be dumb to be smart.

21:42.136 --> 21:43.104
No, no, no, no, no.

21:43.137 --> 21:44.105
This is dumb.

21:44.138 --> 21:45.640
We have to cast 'em out.

21:45.673 --> 21:47.141
- We gotta cast 'em out.
- What are you-

21:47.175 --> 21:48.543
Cast out the demons.

21:48.576 --> 21:50.978

23:23.938 --> 23:26.140
That's just the setup.

23:26.173 --> 23:28.776
No one feels like
they belong, you know?

23:30.278 --> 23:31.879
People just exploding.

23:34.248 --> 23:36.717
You know, there are
people out there right now

23:36.751 --> 23:38.686
who don't identify as human.

23:38.719 --> 23:43.391

trapped in the wrong body,

corporations nuts

23:52.366 --> 23:53.433
What?

23:53.466 --> 23:54.302
That's it.

23:55.369 --> 23:56.570
What did I say?

23:56.604 --> 23:58.940
Exactly. You have to say stuff.

23:58.973 --> 24:00.508
Like the animal stuff?
What are you talking about?

24:00.541 --> 24:01.876
No.

24:01.909 --> 24:03.344
Um...

24:03.377 --> 24:04.211
Ah...

24:05.713 --> 24:06.547
Okay.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.921
That's what people
are responding to,

24:13.955 --> 24:15.690
is you saying stuff,
so all I have to do

24:15.723 --> 24:17.425
is figure out
how to capture you saying stuff

24:17.457 --> 24:20.328
without it just being you
saying stuff.

24:26.934 --> 24:28.235
Bud, you're putting me
as such a bad pos...

24:28.269 --> 24:29.469
I've seen a lot of fake IDs.

24:29.503 --> 24:30.905
This is so terrible.

24:30.938 --> 24:32.940
This is such a terrible idea.

24:32.974 --> 24:35.576

We're starting a band.

24:55.495 --> 24:56.797
Are, are you guys high?

24:57.765 --> 24:59.667
We need a writer. We suck.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.235
Are you in?

25:01.268 --> 25:02.770
You need a writer? For what?

25:04.839 --> 25:05.940
A secret project.

25:09.276 --> 25:10.277
Oh shit, mom, I gotta go.

25:10.311 --> 25:11.145
<i>Yo, yo, what's up?</i>

25:11.178 --> 25:12.947
Yo, what's up?

25:12.980 --> 25:14.348
Thanks for tuning in
and checking out this video.

25:14.382 --> 25:15.416
Checking out this video.

25:15.449 --> 25:17.518
Rock effect.

25:17.551 --> 25:19.954
My motherfucking life and all
the dope ass shit around me.

25:19.987 --> 25:21.956
Parents use YouTube
as a babysitter.

25:21.989 --> 25:24.191
Like my little niece
who's seven years old,

25:24.225 --> 25:26.694
she worships these guys
who do and say nothing

25:26.727 --> 25:28.796
and promote a lifestyle
of doing and saying nothing.

25:28.829 --> 25:30.031
I don't even need this phone.

25:31.332 --> 25:32.299
<i>Is it okay?</i>

25:32.333 --> 25:33.300
All right.

25:33.334 --> 25:34.869
I need it.

25:34.902 --> 25:36.637
They're sucked in
and they're like watching

25:36.670 --> 25:38.139
the same kind of videos
that they're always watching

25:38.172 --> 25:39.373
and at the end, boom,
it's a satire.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.275
Yo, why is my existence so lit?

25:41.308 --> 25:42.877
Why is my life so lit?

25:42.910 --> 25:44.812
Let's start with
this eagle's nest behind me.

25:44.845 --> 25:46.147
I know how to shoot it, too.

25:47.915 --> 25:49.717
You gotta see this.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.719
Yo, eight million big ones,
eight million big ones.

25:51.752 --> 25:53.454
<i>We've got to do
everything we can</i>

25:53.487 --> 25:54.855
<i>to make our thing look
as crappy as their thing.</i>

25:54.889 --> 25:55.956
That's brilliant.

25:55.990 --> 25:57.625
All right. Let's do it.

25:57.658 --> 26:00.661
Seven bedrooms
and dos Mother Hubbard piscinas.

26:01.595 --> 26:03.197
Is that right? Is that Spanish?

26:03.230 --> 26:05.166
Think that's Italian.

26:05.199 --> 26:07.134
Regulation height
for a hoop is like 10 feet.

26:07.168 --> 26:08.736
I keep mine at seven.
You know why?

26:08.769 --> 26:10.004
I got a small penis.

26:10.037 --> 26:11.705
Hashtag be yourself.

26:11.739 --> 26:13.674
That's my message
to the world is be yourself.

26:13.707 --> 26:15.409
That's what I do
and look what I got.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.512
Hashtag swimming pool,
hashtag cocktail,

26:17.546 --> 26:19.046
hashtag this pineapple life.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.981
Yo, it's so important
to be yourself,

26:21.015 --> 26:22.416
but only your best parts only,
only your pretty parts.

26:22.450 --> 26:23.717
Not that weak shit.

26:23.751 --> 26:25.086
Yo, is that right? Is that...

26:25.119 --> 26:26.420
That's the message, right?

26:30.191 --> 26:32.193
When I see other celebrities
like on the 'gram and shit,

26:32.226 --> 26:33.761
I feel kind of bad about
myself, so I buy more stuff.

26:33.794 --> 26:35.496
Hashtag when, hashtag why,
hashtag wow.

26:35.530 --> 26:36.864
Which is great,
'cause then I just end up

26:36.897 --> 26:39.333
with so much, you know, stuff.

26:39.366 --> 26:41.368
Stuff makes me feel like,

26:41.402 --> 26:43.938
like less than empty inside,
you know?

26:43.971 --> 26:45.606
Hashtag when is it too much?

26:45.639 --> 26:47.408
Hashtag when is it all
going to stop?

26:47.441 --> 26:48.776
Hey you!

26:48.809 --> 26:50.177
- Shit!
- Get off my property!

26:50.211 --> 26:51.378
We got the wrong house!

26:51.412 --> 26:52.413
- Sorry!
- Get outta here!

26:52.446 --> 26:54.516
I got, I got confused!

26:54.549 --> 26:55.550
I got confused!

26:57.651 --> 26:59.386
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Fuck!

26:59.420 --> 27:00.387
Jesus.

27:00.421 --> 27:01.556
All right, where are we?

27:02.957 --> 27:05.826
Oh my god,
I'm spiraling right now.

27:08.162 --> 27:09.363
I've been getting it all wrong.

27:09.396 --> 27:11.298
I've been poisoning y'all.

27:11.332 --> 27:12.366
You can't be following me.

27:12.399 --> 27:13.568
I don't...

27:13.602 --> 27:14.902
I ain't nothin'. I ain't nobody.

27:14.935 --> 27:16.237
I'm no one.

27:16.270 --> 27:18.405
Like I'm no one special, man.

27:18.439 --> 27:20.407
We gotta wake ourselves up.

27:20.441 --> 27:22.309
Oh, it feels so good to be free.

27:25.112 --> 27:27.414
I'm reborn, man, I'm reborn.

27:28.749 --> 27:29.618
Can you relate?

27:30.619 --> 27:32.253
Someone stole my pants.

27:32.286 --> 27:33.120
Woo!

27:34.488 --> 27:36.790
We're going back to nature,
baby.

27:36.824 --> 27:38.259
Yo, you don't need
any of that shit.

27:38.292 --> 27:39.561
You don't need any of that shit.

27:39.594 --> 27:40.629
Can I get an amen?

27:40.661 --> 27:42.129
Can I get an amen baby?

27:42.163 --> 27:43.397
Who's with me?

27:43.430 --> 27:44.665
Y'all feelin' me?

27:44.698 --> 27:45.799
Can you relate?

27:45.833 --> 27:46.834
Can you relate?

27:46.867 --> 27:49.103
Yeah! You can relate!

27:49.136 --> 27:50.304
You're feelin' me!

27:50.337 --> 27:51.606
- Woo!
- What the hell?

27:51.640 --> 27:52.641
Hey!

27:52.673 --> 27:53.841
Man, got any spare pants?

27:53.874 --> 27:55.242
Hey. Hey man, hey.

27:55.276 --> 27:56.578
Oh what's up, baby?

27:56.611 --> 27:57.845
- What's up?
- Face that way.

27:57.878 --> 27:59.648
- Hey, I know you!
- Face that wall.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.248
I know you.

28:01.282 --> 28:02.517
I just woke up in my soul,
in my heart.

28:03.450 --> 28:04.586
You feelin' me baby?

28:04.619 --> 28:06.987
I know you feelin' me baby, yes.

28:07.021 --> 28:08.322
Can I get an amen?

28:08.355 --> 28:09.924
Where am I?

28:09.957 --> 28:11.158
Where am I?

28:11.192 --> 28:13.662
Oh, I love this town.

28:13.694 --> 28:16.297
I love you. I love you so much.

28:17.331 --> 28:18.499
Holy shit.

28:18.533 --> 28:20.669
Holy shit. You gotta see this.

28:20.701 --> 28:21.702
Whoa.

28:21.735 --> 28:23.204
Look at all the comments.

28:23.237 --> 28:24.872
"I want this guy
to run me over in a truck

28:24.905 --> 28:26.273
and then reverse
over my dead body."

28:26.307 --> 28:27.107
That's interesting.

28:27.141 --> 28:28.309
Oh my God.

28:28.342 --> 28:30.110
Juanpa just sent me a selfie.

28:30.144 --> 28:31.312
He wants to do an interview
with you.

28:31.345 --> 28:32.681
Juanpa's huge.

28:32.713 --> 28:34.014
Juanpa's huge.

28:34.048 --> 28:35.216
I don't,
I don't know who that is.

28:35.249 --> 28:36.884
Guys, guys, look at the views.

28:51.232 --> 28:54.835
We are officially live,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:54.868 --> 28:56.036
Welcome.

28:56.070 --> 28:57.505
This is a very special episode

28:57.539 --> 28:59.306
because we got
a very rare guest.

28:59.340 --> 29:02.309
Please give it up
for No One Special.

29:02.343 --> 29:04.078
Woo hoo hoo!

29:04.111 --> 29:06.013
And by the way, I'm not
being a terrible friend here.

29:06.046 --> 29:07.582
That's how you call yourself,
right?

29:07.616 --> 29:09.651
That's my name.
It's my given name.

29:09.684 --> 29:10.818
- No.
- At birth, yeah.

29:10.851 --> 29:11.885
No One Special.

29:11.919 --> 29:13.354
Wow.

29:13.387 --> 29:14.922
No one is like one word
and then special.

29:14.955 --> 29:16.423
Like we're all kind of
no one special.

29:16.457 --> 29:17.258
That's just kind of the idea,
right?

29:17.291 --> 29:18.693
Yeah.

29:18.727 --> 29:20.160
We're all the same.
We're all equal.

29:20.194 --> 29:21.362
Okay. Okay,
let's try this again.

29:21.395 --> 29:22.930
- When I clap...
- Yeah.

29:22.963 --> 29:26.000
You, you like jump
and fall into frame.

29:26.033 --> 29:27.768
All right.

29:27.801 --> 29:28.769
So I'll clap and I'll stop
and then you jump in.

29:28.802 --> 29:29.770
All right. Let's try it.

29:29.803 --> 29:30.739
- Okay?
- Yep.

29:30.771 --> 29:31.706
Here it is.

29:31.740 --> 29:32.773
No One Special!

29:33.941 --> 29:36.277
Oh my God!

29:36.310 --> 29:38.580
I've never seen Juanpa
this happy before.

29:38.613 --> 29:39.780
A couple of questions for you.

29:39.813 --> 29:40.615
Go on.

29:40.649 --> 29:41.849
Uh...

29:41.882 --> 29:42.550
Can I just do this real quick?

29:42.584 --> 29:43.752
Yeah.

29:43.784 --> 29:44.952
Sorry, I've been wanting like,

29:44.985 --> 29:46.420
since I like laid eyes on you,

29:46.453 --> 29:47.388
I've just been wanting
to like...

29:47.421 --> 29:48.122
His name is Isaac.

29:48.155 --> 29:48.956
Oh wow.

29:48.989 --> 29:50.692
Pretty deep.

29:50.725 --> 29:52.293
Pretty deep first moments
with No One Special.

29:52.326 --> 29:53.961
I just feel like
we need experience other...

29:53.994 --> 29:55.429
All right, all right,
do we first bump now?

29:55.462 --> 29:56.930
No, I just hump you
with my beard.

29:56.964 --> 29:57.965
Can we just fist bump?

29:57.998 --> 29:59.900
Okay, anyways. Boom, bam.

29:59.933 --> 30:01.902
Your boyfriend's fine.

30:01.935 --> 30:03.404
- He's not my boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.

30:03.437 --> 30:05.406
I uh, I represent Juanpa.

30:05.439 --> 30:08.208
So what's what's the next thing
for No One Special?

30:08.242 --> 30:09.276
What's the next thing
for No One...

30:09.310 --> 30:10.745
I don't know.

30:10.779 --> 30:11.780
- I'm just here with Juanpa.
- Yeah?

30:11.812 --> 30:13.147
Here with my hero Juanpa.

30:13.180 --> 30:14.415
Eh ah, I'm not your hero,
come on.

30:14.448 --> 30:16.250
You guys need anything,

30:16.283 --> 30:17.251
I want you to...

30:19.953 --> 30:24.958
Give me a call.

30:25.459 --> 30:27.328
Hey, just take a photo of it.

30:27.361 --> 30:29.229
Yeah, I got it.

30:29.263 --> 30:30.331
I'm Mark Schwartz.

30:31.599 --> 30:33.300
- I'm the guy behind the guy.
- I got a idea, yeah.

30:33.334 --> 30:35.603
I want to invite these guys
to join us on something.

30:35.637 --> 30:37.237
- You want to go with me?
- Bring it.

30:37.271 --> 30:38.773
Me and Juanpa
have an invitation for you.

30:38.807 --> 30:40.608
We want you to join us
tomorrow night

30:40.642 --> 30:43.678
at Four Stone Cemetery
or go to any graveyard near you,

30:43.712 --> 30:45.179
and we,
we're gonna have a party.

30:45.212 --> 30:46.815
You're gonna bring
your cell phones,

30:46.847 --> 30:48.449
but then you're going to
place it on a grave,

30:48.482 --> 30:50.117
you're going to turn
the screen to white,

30:50.150 --> 30:51.586
and together
for one night only we're going

30:51.619 --> 30:53.087
to experience
something real together.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.455
We are going to ghost
the internet.

30:54.488 --> 30:56.890
You, me...

30:58.325 --> 31:00.194
And Juanpa.

31:00.227 --> 31:01.696
Would you rather have everything
and understand nothing

31:01.730 --> 31:04.198
or understand everything
and have nothing?

31:04.231 --> 31:05.800
Um, have everything.

31:05.834 --> 31:07.334
Yeah, you'd understand nothing,
though.

31:07.368 --> 31:08.603
Yeah.

31:08.636 --> 31:09.771
That's the premise of the joke.

31:09.804 --> 31:11.706
- That's hard.
- But no,

31:11.740 --> 31:13.608
I would just eat donuts and
ride around in a baby carriage

31:13.641 --> 31:16.009
with a chauffeur and I would
buy sunglasses all day.

31:16.043 --> 31:17.144
Yes, I'd wear a muumuu.

31:17.177 --> 31:18.379
I would wear no underwear.

31:18.412 --> 31:20.114
Do another one. Do another one.

31:20.147 --> 31:21.315
Uh, would you rather
have permanent diarrhea

31:21.348 --> 31:22.550
or have penises for fingers?

31:22.584 --> 31:23.785
You'd have penises for fingers.

31:23.818 --> 31:25.319
Penis for fingers, obviously.

31:25.352 --> 31:27.020
Yeah, because like,
it'd be like this.

31:27.054 --> 31:28.523
Hey, nice to meet you.

31:28.556 --> 31:29.923
And then just like whoa.

31:30.825 --> 31:32.660
Everyone would know
how you felt all the time.

31:32.694 --> 31:34.395
Yeah.

31:34.428 --> 31:35.496
That's the only danger
'cause it's like people

31:35.530 --> 31:36.497
will get uncomfortable.

31:36.531 --> 31:39.199
Don't tread on that.

31:39.233 --> 31:40.501
- Okay.
- You can walk over it.

31:43.838 --> 31:45.305
Whoa.

31:45.339 --> 31:46.541
Whoa.

31:46.574 --> 31:47.441
Holy shit.

31:51.245 --> 31:53.815
People came.

31:53.848 --> 31:58.051
♪ No one wants to be
the odd one out at times ♪

31:58.085 --> 31:59.521
♪ No one wants to be the

31:59.554 --> 32:01.288
All right. Let's go say hi.

32:03.591 --> 32:04.391
Yeah.

32:04.425 --> 32:05.259
Do, um...

32:07.595 --> 32:09.229
Is that No One Special?

32:09.263 --> 32:12.065
Hey, it's No One Special.

32:12.099 --> 32:13.701
- You're even bigger in person.
- Hi.

32:13.735 --> 32:15.202
Hi, how are you?

32:15.235 --> 32:17.337
Guys, what the hell?

32:19.072 --> 32:20.842
We didn't expect anybody
to come.

32:20.875 --> 32:23.243
Yo, yo, yo!

32:23.277 --> 32:24.779
This is crazy, this is crazy.

32:24.813 --> 32:26.681
Yo, yo, don't wake the dead.

32:26.714 --> 32:28.248
So seriously,
anybody who's still got a cellphone,

32:28.282 --> 32:30.217
put 'em on a grave
and let 'em light up

32:30.250 --> 32:32.554
like fireflies
all through the night.

32:33.621 --> 32:35.757
And then we'll just hang!

32:35.790 --> 32:37.224
Hey, this is all that matters

32:37.257 --> 32:39.259
is that we're all here.

32:39.293 --> 32:40.862
Oh my god.

32:40.895 --> 32:41.962
It's crazy how good
at this he is, huh?

32:55.108 --> 32:56.811
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no

32:56.845 --> 32:59.781
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no selfies.

32:59.814 --> 33:01.482
Tonight this is just about us
hanging out together.

33:01.516 --> 33:03.250
All of us together.
How about a hug?

33:03.283 --> 33:05.319
Give you a hug?
Yeah, I'll give you a hug.

33:05.352 --> 33:07.321
Put 'em on a gravestone,
set the screen to white.

33:07.354 --> 33:09.056
Let the battery die out
like we said, okay?

33:09.089 --> 33:11.726
Get rid of them phones man.

33:11.759 --> 33:13.060
Whoa, bud.

33:13.093 --> 33:14.294
Yo, who's got a drink?

33:16.831 --> 33:17.998
All right, that's good.

33:18.031 --> 33:19.032
Who's got something to smoke?

33:28.275 --> 33:30.244
Cheers, dad. I liked this one.

33:30.277 --> 33:31.546
Peach apple iced tea.

33:43.658 --> 33:45.292
Hello, this is Mark Schwartz.

33:45.325 --> 33:46.861
I hear things are really
going great down there

33:46.895 --> 33:49.797
at the cemetery,
which I don't often say.

33:49.831 --> 33:52.634
Why don't we meet at my office
Monday morning, 10:00 AM?

33:54.903 --> 33:56.336
Who wants that?

34:02.977 --> 34:05.680
Be right back.

34:21.896 --> 34:24.164
You're my little brother,
I love you.

34:24.197 --> 34:26.668
- Yeah, yeah.
- I just wanna talk to you.

34:26.701 --> 34:30.838
It's not a fuckin' ruse.
It's not a fuckin' ruse.

34:30.872 --> 34:32.507
Bullshit.

34:32.540 --> 34:34.174
What the fuck?
Where are you fucking going?

34:34.207 --> 34:35.043
Hey!

34:36.243 --> 34:38.580
Where are you fucking going?

35:28.328 --> 35:30.163
I was in the car with my dad.

35:33.901 --> 35:36.070
We hit a tree
and he died instantly.

35:39.473 --> 35:41.475
He was taking me
to a friend's house.

35:43.978 --> 35:48.983
I wanted to go to this party.

36:28.488 --> 36:30.490
No, doesn't even work.

36:32.860 --> 36:34.361
That's disgusting.

36:47.809 --> 36:49.376
Yeah, who gives a fuck
about this guy?

36:50.745 --> 36:53.380
Who's that guy that you were
talking to in the graveyard?

37:01.089 --> 37:01.889
Hey.

37:01.923 --> 37:03.323
Hey.

37:03.356 --> 37:05.993
Hey.

37:06.027 --> 37:06.928
- Hey
- Hey.

37:12.200 --> 37:14.301
These marketing assholes.
Story of my life.

37:14.334 --> 37:15.368
I'm on mute.
Don't worry about it.

37:15.402 --> 37:17.038
How are you?

37:17.071 --> 37:19.173
Sorry I've been on this call
for six hours.

37:19.207 --> 37:22.710
Hey guys. This is Mark
chiming in here again.

37:22.744 --> 37:25.179
$500,000 or go away.

37:25.213 --> 37:27.014
You've got 30 seconds
to say yes.

37:27.048 --> 37:28.583
Every time you don't say yes,

37:28.616 --> 37:30.585
it's going to go up 10 grand,
all right?

37:30.618 --> 37:31.853
Mute.

37:31.886 --> 37:32.887
I swear to God.

37:32.920 --> 37:33.988
Um, here's a bad sign.

37:34.021 --> 37:35.156
We're a sports company.

37:35.189 --> 37:36.858
We'd like to work with you.

37:36.891 --> 37:38.092
Every single executive
who works with us is fat.

37:38.126 --> 37:39.761
Mark, we can hear you.

37:39.794 --> 37:40.628
Hello?

37:45.233 --> 37:46.200
No One Special.

37:47.101 --> 37:48.603
It's a pleasure.

37:48.636 --> 37:50.071
I haven't seen everything,

37:50.104 --> 37:51.672
but what I've seen,
I really love.

37:51.706 --> 37:53.241
And you want to make
some money off us.

37:53.273 --> 37:54.742
The little I've seen,
you've changed me,

37:54.776 --> 37:56.043
and I think I don't want
to hoard that.

37:56.077 --> 37:57.245
I want everyone
to feel that way.

37:57.277 --> 37:58.378
Oh, okay.

37:58.411 --> 37:59.614
So you want us to do porn?

37:59.647 --> 38:00.882
No, I don't want you to do porn.

38:00.915 --> 38:02.784
I think he's being metaphorical

38:02.817 --> 38:03.918
because we don't want to put
the cart before the horse.

38:03.951 --> 38:05.553
Right.

38:05.586 --> 38:07.121
So you used another metaphor
in that metaphor

38:07.155 --> 38:08.523
to explain that one?

38:08.556 --> 38:09.857
You're a writer, right?

38:09.891 --> 38:10.691
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

38:10.725 --> 38:11.559
Here's the deal.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.493
You've got talent.

38:14.829 --> 38:16.864
Do you know where the
word talent comes from?

38:16.898 --> 38:18.032
It's Middle English.

38:18.065 --> 38:19.634
Originally talent was money.

38:19.667 --> 38:21.569
How many talents do you have?

38:21.602 --> 38:23.738
Let's say you make a video
about a gorilla

38:23.771 --> 38:25.740
eating spaghetti
who speaks French.

38:25.773 --> 38:27.608
A thousand people watch it.

38:27.642 --> 38:29.977
The algorithm hears that,
sends it to the powers

38:30.011 --> 38:32.880
that be at YouTube,
which is really not YouTube,

38:32.914 --> 38:34.414
it's their tube.

38:34.447 --> 38:36.551
They say, hey,
we see a lot of people

38:36.584 --> 38:38.586
are coming to you with views.

38:38.619 --> 38:40.487
Well, guess what?

38:40.521 --> 38:42.957
You qualify for a Adidas video
in front of your thing.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.058
Would you like to do that?

38:44.091 --> 38:45.827
We'll give you $10,000.

38:46.761 --> 38:47.562
That's great, right?

38:47.595 --> 38:49.396
No.

38:49.429 --> 38:51.666
What you want to do,
you go to the brands yourself

38:51.699 --> 38:54.501
or they come to you if you
are gaining enough traction

38:54.535 --> 38:57.572
and you aren't represented
by anything, stay yourself.

38:57.605 --> 38:59.841
Then Subway comes to you.
$200,000.

38:59.874 --> 39:02.109
That was a $200,000 sub.

39:02.143 --> 39:03.343
You want us to endorse brands.

39:03.376 --> 39:05.012
No, no, no. They endorse you.

39:05.046 --> 39:06.013
You don't endorse them.

39:06.047 --> 39:07.815
That's how we work.

39:07.849 --> 39:09.416
Do you want to be the guys
that made two cool videos

39:09.449 --> 39:11.285
and then disappeared
into the ether?

39:13.154 --> 39:14.956
Or do you want
to be No One Special?

39:18.059 --> 39:19.994
I got you the money.
I got you the stage.

39:20.027 --> 39:21.762
I'm drafting you right now
into the army.

39:21.796 --> 39:23.430
Let's go.
Tonight we parachute in.

39:23.463 --> 39:24.832
Jake, you're the writer,
you need to write it.

39:24.866 --> 39:26.499
Link, you're gonna act it,

39:26.534 --> 39:28.936
and I'm gonna figure
how to fucking do it.

39:28.970 --> 39:32.439
So we have phone or no phone.

39:32.472 --> 39:34.208
That's the question.

39:34.242 --> 39:38.279
Then we have the idea
of a game show, a talk show.

39:38.312 --> 39:40.480
What if we put
those two ideas together?

39:40.514 --> 39:42.250
Internet killed the TV star?

39:43.317 --> 39:44.552
No. Bad.

39:44.585 --> 39:45.385
Bad idea.

39:45.418 --> 39:46.254
Good idea?

39:56.063 --> 39:57.464
Oh.

39:57.497 --> 39:58.566
Oh, sorry, sorry.

39:58.599 --> 39:59.867
Morning.

40:08.175 --> 40:09.243
Oh, shit.

40:10.111 --> 40:11.078
You all right?

40:11.112 --> 40:11.946
Yeah.

40:16.217 --> 40:17.184
Okay.

40:17.218 --> 40:18.052
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:19.687 --> 40:20.688
Bye, baby.

40:31.431 --> 40:32.432
You need a ride?

40:32.465 --> 40:34.168
No, I'm good. Thanks.

40:34.201 --> 40:35.236
Good work today, man.

40:52.753 --> 40:54.855
I should go, too.

40:54.889 --> 40:55.723
Of course.

40:56.657 --> 40:58.192
Yeah, 'cause I gotta, you know,

40:58.225 --> 40:59.393
I got a big night ahead of me,
so...

40:59.427 --> 41:00.695
Oh yeah?

41:00.728 --> 41:01.562
Yeah.

41:02.763 --> 41:03.764
Oh yeah, that thing.

41:03.798 --> 41:05.132
Sorry. I forgot.

41:05.166 --> 41:07.234
- Oh it's a thing, so...
- Yeah.

41:07.268 --> 41:09.270
I wouldn't want to get in
the way of you doing a thing.

41:09.303 --> 41:10.137
Yeah.

41:12.406 --> 41:13.574
Mhm.

41:13.607 --> 41:15.276
That's what I love about you,

41:15.309 --> 41:16.610
is that you really support me
doing my thing.

41:23.184 --> 41:25.052
I think you're cool.

41:25.086 --> 41:26.620
All right, bye.

Hey.

42:39.093 --> 42:39.894
Here we go.

42:39.927 --> 42:41.695
Here we go.

42:41.729 --> 42:43.064
Did you make those changes
on the mouse trap scene?

42:43.097 --> 42:44.865
No, we cut that, remember?

42:44.899 --> 42:46.667
We're gonna do the
greenhouse gases bit instead?

42:46.700 --> 42:48.836
No, Jake, greenhouse is cut
and mouse traps is in.

42:48.869 --> 42:50.805
Wait, what?

42:50.838 --> 42:52.039
What? No, we have to have
those moments that are serious-

42:52.073 --> 42:53.407
We like moustraps better.

42:53.441 --> 42:54.875
- We have so many goofy-
- Look.

42:54.909 --> 42:56.143
- Boo!
- The show-

42:56.177 --> 42:58.012
- Oh.
- Jesus Christ, man.

42:58.045 --> 42:59.680
Hey, you're gonna stay on
like the whole time, right?

42:59.713 --> 43:00.748
Just keep focused on him.

43:00.781 --> 43:02.383
Here we go. Here we go.

43:02.416 --> 43:03.552
Oh, you guys
have never done this before.

43:03.584 --> 43:04.752
- How you doin'?
- Oh.

43:04.785 --> 43:06.353
Good.

43:07.221 --> 43:08.222
Hey.

43:08.255 --> 43:09.723
Hey, I need to uh...

43:10.758 --> 43:13.194
I...

43:13.227 --> 43:14.529
I don't know if I can do this.

43:14.563 --> 43:16.163
You're going to be great, man.

43:16.197 --> 43:17.031
Don't worry about it.
Don't overthink it.

43:17.064 --> 43:18.732
Just breathe.

43:18.766 --> 43:19.600
No, you've got to be dumb
to be smart, right?

43:19.633 --> 43:21.368
Go be dumb.

43:21.402 --> 43:23.838
If we do this,
you know there's no going back.

43:23.871 --> 43:25.039
Who wants to go back?

43:25.072 --> 43:26.440
Showtime.

43:26.474 --> 43:27.308
Let's do it.

43:47.596 --> 43:49.497
And action.

44:21.929 --> 44:24.999
Thank you, severed hand.

44:25.032 --> 44:28.135
What a response.
Give a hand to the hand.

44:30.037 --> 44:31.573
I'm your host and I'm,
you know, I'm No One Special.

44:31.606 --> 44:32.740
And are you all um...

44:34.675 --> 44:36.210
You're all sitting comfortably?

44:37.044 --> 44:39.180
And when you all came
into the studio today,

44:39.213 --> 44:41.015
you were asked to

44:41.048 --> 44:43.083
hand over your cell phones
and sign some, some uh,

44:43.117 --> 44:44.586
some kind of waivers.

44:44.619 --> 44:46.521
Hey, severed hand is back.

44:46.555 --> 44:48.322
I hope you read
the small print, folks,

44:48.355 --> 44:50.491
'cause you've just signed
your phones over to me.

44:50.525 --> 44:51.358
Oh.

44:52.393 --> 44:55.129
The atmosphere
is suddenly so tense.

44:55.162 --> 44:57.097
Can you feel it at home, kids?

44:57.131 --> 45:02.136
As we play Your Phone
or Your Dignity?

45:08.709 --> 45:10.177
Sorry.

45:10.211 --> 45:11.779
I don't remember.

45:11.812 --> 45:13.147
Am I going here?
Where am I going, Candice?

45:13.180 --> 45:14.315
Over there?

45:14.348 --> 45:15.382
Candice told me to go here.

45:15.416 --> 45:16.651
I don't even know.

45:16.685 --> 45:17.918
Let's see who we got. Hi.

45:20.387 --> 45:21.556
Everybody's miserable.

45:21.590 --> 45:23.190
Everybody's so sad.

45:23.224 --> 45:24.358
Why is everyone so...

45:24.391 --> 45:25.826
It's a game show. It's fun.

45:25.859 --> 45:27.494
Excuse me. Let me squeeze.

45:27.529 --> 45:29.730
Bring the music, music down.
We can't hear.

45:29.763 --> 45:30.864
Cut the music!

45:30.898 --> 45:32.567
That's the cue to cut the-

45:32.601 --> 45:33.635
So sir, what's your name?
Where are you from?

45:33.668 --> 45:34.802
Um, my name is Martin.

45:34.835 --> 45:35.970
I'm from Temecula.

45:36.003 --> 45:37.572
Beautiful name, beautiful place.

45:37.606 --> 45:39.039
God's country.
Had an aunt from Temecula.

45:39.073 --> 45:40.407
You want to feel my carpet?

45:41.408 --> 45:42.209
Um...

45:42.243 --> 45:43.244
Yeah you do!

45:43.277 --> 45:44.512
Let's go.

45:44.546 --> 45:46.080
Here we are, me and Martin.

45:50.751 --> 45:52.319
Come on, feel it.

45:52.353 --> 45:53.854
You wanna lay on it?

45:53.887 --> 45:54.888
Oh, sure.

45:56.123 --> 45:57.559
How does that feel?

45:57.592 --> 45:59.226
It feels like just great,
smooth.

45:59.260 --> 46:00.094
Smooth ass carpet.

46:00.127 --> 46:01.696
Smooth carpet.

46:01.730 --> 46:03.397
All right,
enough fooling around folks.

46:03.430 --> 46:05.099
Let's get on with the show.

46:06.701 --> 46:08.168
One simple question for you,
Martin.

46:08.202 --> 46:10.705
How badly do you need
your phone?

46:11.573 --> 46:14.875
Um, I mean, yeah,
I use it all the time.

46:14.908 --> 46:16.343
Right. Don't we all?

46:16.377 --> 46:19.079
Well, Martin,
it is your lucky day

46:19.113 --> 46:23.917
because you get to walk away
with $100

46:23.951 --> 46:26.820
and one of these
brand spanking new devices.

46:28.889 --> 46:31.425
These phones come with
no camera and no internet

46:31.458 --> 46:34.428
which means freedom from self
obsession and social media.

46:34.461 --> 46:36.598
What a prize, am I right?

46:38.999 --> 46:42.403
Or, Martin, you can complete
one of our challenges

46:42.436 --> 46:47.642
to retrieve your old, needy,
soul sucking phone.

46:47.676 --> 46:49.276
It was like 800 bucks.

46:49.310 --> 46:50.811
Yeah, I need it.
I use it all the time.

46:50.844 --> 46:52.413
Well if you want
your phone back, Martin,

46:52.446 --> 46:55.382
you're going to have to
wrestle this guy for it.

46:55.416 --> 46:57.117
Come and get your phone, Martin.

46:59.186 --> 47:00.020
Chee-hoo!

47:00.988 --> 47:01.822
Ah!

47:03.591 --> 47:04.925
I'm backing you, Martin.

47:06.661 --> 47:07.995
Yes.

47:09.029 --> 47:09.997
Oh come on, Martin.

47:10.030 --> 47:11.131
You're better than this.

47:12.299 --> 47:13.768
Isn't he doing great?

47:18.038 --> 47:19.808
And, ah, he's got it.

47:20.675 --> 47:23.977
Give it up for Martin
from Temecula, I guess.

47:24.011 --> 47:25.179
I got my phone.

47:25.212 --> 47:27.081
He got his phone back.

47:27.114 --> 47:30.785
Welcome to the rest
of your life, Martin.

47:43.631 --> 47:46.367
I'm Charles Melton and I'm
here with No One Special.

47:48.168 --> 47:50.137
We're about to destroy
Chuck's phone.

47:58.011 --> 47:59.480
- Woo!
- Got it!

47:59.514 --> 48:02.483
Chuck M killed it.
No One Special.

48:02.517 --> 48:03.384
Stay tuned.

48:03.417 --> 48:05.386
NoOneSpecial.com.

48:05.419 --> 48:06.253

50:29.463 --> 50:31.298
I just wanted to say I'm sorry

50:31.331 --> 50:33.133
that we're not doing
the twinning politicians thing.

50:33.166 --> 50:34.301
Yeah. Okay, sure.

50:37.371 --> 50:38.706
You know I see you, right?

50:40.374 --> 50:41.843
You see me?

50:41.876 --> 50:43.377
I see you flirting
with that girl.

50:43.410 --> 50:44.244
I see you.

50:47.381 --> 50:49.082
You call that flirting? Well...

50:49.984 --> 50:51.151
Yeah.

50:51.184 --> 50:52.787
Oh no, I'll show you flirting.

50:52.820 --> 50:54.656
I'll take you to the back room
right now.

50:54.689 --> 50:56.323
Thought you've taken
enough people to the back room.

50:59.761 --> 51:00.595
Don't hurt her.

51:05.867 --> 51:08.435
I love that, Jake. I love it.

51:09.369 --> 51:11.639
Eh uh, how else can I say it?

51:11.673 --> 51:14.308
I'm just,
I'm getting a little antsy.

51:14.341 --> 51:15.877
But I don't understand,
antsy about what?

51:15.910 --> 51:17.477
Specifically what's going wrong?

51:17.512 --> 51:18.913
It's not a nosedive.

51:18.947 --> 51:21.683
It's more like, um,
like a little,

51:21.716 --> 51:23.083
like a little, um...

51:23.116 --> 51:24.819
Just spit it out, Mark.

51:24.852 --> 51:26.888
We're down about 15%
since the last episode.

51:26.921 --> 51:29.156
If you don't do something,
you will lose more.

51:29.189 --> 51:30.658
It's science.

51:30.692 --> 51:31.826
Just shake it up.

51:31.859 --> 51:32.860
Get people interested again.

51:32.894 --> 51:33.928
Get 'em back up.

51:33.962 --> 51:35.063
It all corrects itself.

51:35.095 --> 51:36.030
Yes. Yes.

51:36.064 --> 51:37.599
I'm busting my ass

51:37.632 --> 51:39.867
and you're writing
the same old tired shit.

51:39.901 --> 51:41.836
I've been saying that for weeks.

51:41.869 --> 51:43.037
You guys told me that I had
to stick to the formula.

51:43.071 --> 51:44.505
It was working, now it's not.

51:44.539 --> 51:46.406
We're all clear
it's not Jake's fault.

51:46.440 --> 51:48.375
I wrote the greenhouse gases
bit and then that got cut.

51:48.408 --> 51:50.578
Yeah, 'cause climate change
isn't sexy right now, Jake.

51:50.612 --> 51:52.179
I'm sorry.
Climate change isn't sexy?

51:52.212 --> 51:54.348
Are you out of your mind?

51:54.381 --> 51:55.750
I didn't know the end of the
world is supposed to be sexy.

51:55.783 --> 51:57.250
Can you take the cotton
out of your ears

51:57.284 --> 51:58.251
and put it in your mouth
for one second

51:58.285 --> 52:00.021
and listen to Mark?

52:00.054 --> 52:01.556
We're losing views
and we need to get them back up,

52:01.589 --> 52:02.624
so we need to write stuff
that's new,

52:02.657 --> 52:04.224
not cliche, not boring.

52:04.257 --> 52:05.760
Well it won't be boring
when the polar bears

52:05.793 --> 52:07.227
are scratching
at our front door because

52:07.260 --> 52:08.863
- their habitats are melted.
- Fuck.

52:08.896 --> 52:09.897
And it won't be boring
when we don't have

52:09.931 --> 52:11.599
any clean water to drink.

52:11.633 --> 52:13.266
We need to get
Jake's soapbox in here, guys.

52:13.300 --> 52:14.134
Get the viewers back up
before we lose anymore.

52:14.167 --> 52:15.870
It's very simple.

52:15.903 --> 52:17.437
Come up with something amazing
and new, now.

52:17.471 --> 52:18.940
I know you hate me.

52:18.973 --> 52:20.775
You're going to love me soon.
Trust me.

52:20.808 --> 52:23.410
Welcome to fuckin' life, baby.

52:25.312 --> 52:26.446
Where's the chocolate?

52:26.480 --> 52:27.280
Are you too high and mighty?

52:27.314 --> 52:28.448
Mm, yeah.

52:28.482 --> 52:29.917
And you know what a fuckin'

52:29.951 --> 52:30.585
hungry polar bear
will really do?

52:30.618 --> 52:31.819
Eat you.

52:31.853 --> 52:33.153
It will eat you.

52:33.186 --> 52:34.989
You can love it from here.

52:35.023 --> 52:36.256
Let me tell you,
if you ever met a real polar bear,

52:36.289 --> 52:38.126
they would fuckin' eat you.

52:40.260 --> 52:41.996
I got an idea.

52:42.030 --> 52:45.099
What if we shifted
the way people behave online?

52:45.133 --> 52:46.934
Not trying to take away
the phone,

52:46.968 --> 52:49.671
but trying to put the soul back
into the phone?

52:57.545 --> 52:59.580
What do you say we shake it up
a little bit, folks?

52:59.614 --> 53:01.448
There's someone I'm looking for.

53:01.481 --> 53:02.382
There's someone...

53:03.383 --> 53:05.687
Do we have an Isabelle Roberts?

53:05.720 --> 53:06.621
Isabelle Roberts?

53:06.654 --> 53:08.355
Yes?

53:08.388 --> 53:10.024
Okay, and bring around
the camera on Isabelle.

53:10.058 --> 53:11.125
Sweetheart,
what are you waiting for?

53:11.159 --> 53:12.694
Destiny awaits!

53:12.727 --> 53:14.996
I don't know about this.

53:15.029 --> 53:18.866
Yeah, you made that very clear
in the room.

53:18.900 --> 53:20.768
Let's let it play out.

53:20.802 --> 53:21.703
Isabelle.

53:23.004 --> 53:24.072
That's sexy.

53:26.074 --> 53:27.508
Hi.

53:27.542 --> 53:29.309
So Isabelle,
my source is telling me,

53:29.342 --> 53:31.112
you mind if I lean on you?

53:31.145 --> 53:33.548
My source is telling me
you're a big fan of Instagram,

53:33.581 --> 53:35.282
- is that right?
- Mhm.

53:35.315 --> 53:37.250
Okay. So let's have a look
at your best shot.

53:38.886 --> 53:39.987
- Yeah.
- Whoa!

53:40.021 --> 53:41.155
- Beautiful.
- What?

53:43.658 --> 53:45.225
You gotta warn me next time

53:45.258 --> 53:46.060
there's gonna be a supermodel
in the room.

53:46.094 --> 53:47.995
Here we go.

53:48.029 --> 53:49.664
What's your secret, Isabelle,
for looking so damn fresh?

53:52.499 --> 53:54.234
I don't, I don't know.

53:54.267 --> 53:57.171
I drink a lot of water,
I guess, and try to eat well.

53:57.205 --> 53:58.673
Well, let's have a look
at the original version

53:58.706 --> 53:59.674
of the photo we found
on your phone.

53:59.707 --> 54:00.541
No, no...

54:05.179 --> 54:07.148
Oh.

54:13.955 --> 54:15.422
Did you know
that she had a birthmark?

54:15.455 --> 54:16.289
That's a...

54:19.727 --> 54:20.528
It's a birthmark.

54:20.561 --> 54:21.394
Well...

54:22.429 --> 54:23.263
Yeah.

54:24.364 --> 54:28.603
Well I don't, I don't see it...

54:28.636 --> 54:30.238
I don't see it now.

54:32.774 --> 54:34.008
I have my makeup on.

54:34.041 --> 54:35.009
Oh, of course.

54:35.042 --> 54:37.078
Well, you know what?

54:37.111 --> 54:38.179
I think that's just another
beautiful part of yourself.

54:38.212 --> 54:39.446
What do you guys think?

54:39.479 --> 54:40.681
Yeah!

54:41.716 --> 54:45.019
Proud. She's proud.

54:45.052 --> 54:46.754
Tell me something,
how many likes do you think

54:46.788 --> 54:48.556
this version of the photo
would get?

54:48.589 --> 54:51.192
Uh, I would, I would never...

54:51.225 --> 54:53.127
I wouldn't.

54:53.161 --> 54:55.295
Are you prepared to let
the world see the real you?

54:56.998 --> 54:58.699
What do you mean?

54:58.733 --> 54:59.734
You're not gonna...

54:59.767 --> 55:01.301
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

55:01.334 --> 55:02.937
No, no, I'm not.
I'm not gonna do anything.

55:03.971 --> 55:04.806
You are.

55:12.246 --> 55:13.080
Isabelle.

55:16.851 --> 55:18.451
If you hit this button,

55:18.485 --> 55:20.054
the original version
of this photo

55:20.087 --> 55:22.089
will be sent out
to all your followers

55:22.123 --> 55:23.825
with the hashtag the real me,

55:23.858 --> 55:27.494
and you'll walk away
with $400 and your phone

55:27.528 --> 55:30.998
and a tremendous amount
of self-respect and liberation.

55:31.032 --> 55:33.267
So what should she do audience?

55:33.301 --> 55:35.837
Does she press the button?

55:35.870 --> 55:38.606
Um, will you just mostly
stay on the wide for now?

55:38.639 --> 55:40.007
Thank you.

55:43.544 --> 55:46.346
I mean, it's pretty clear
what they want,

55:46.379 --> 55:47.515
but it's up to you, Isabelle.

55:47.548 --> 55:48.950
So what's it gonna be?

55:48.983 --> 55:50.952
Your phone or your vanity?

55:53.688 --> 55:55.323
I can't, I can't.

55:55.355 --> 55:57.024
This is the best.

55:57.058 --> 55:58.192
Everyone in the audience
can see it.

55:58.226 --> 56:00.094
What are you afraid of, darling?

56:00.127 --> 56:02.530
That these people at home
will think that you're ugly,

56:02.563 --> 56:03.998
that they'll think
you're rejectable?

56:04.031 --> 56:05.465
That they'll think
you're unlovable?

56:05.498 --> 56:08.435
We are in trouble, folks. Woo.

56:08.468 --> 56:12.540
We got innocent,
pure angels who have

56:12.573 --> 56:14.441
somehow been brainwashed.

56:14.474 --> 56:16.711
We are disfiguring ourselves.

56:17.578 --> 56:21.182
Taking needles,
shoving them in our faces.

56:21.215 --> 56:22.617
They're taking our chins
and they're

56:22.650 --> 56:23.985
putting them in our asses.

56:25.052 --> 56:27.321
You're saving polar bears
right now, Jake.

56:27.355 --> 56:28.356
Okay, come on.

56:29.824 --> 56:31.325
Stop it.

56:31.359 --> 56:33.127
- Are you gonna stop this.
- Look, it could

56:33.160 --> 56:34.862
- be really powerful.
- No, are you gonna stop this?

56:34.896 --> 56:35.897
- Look at her face.
- It could be really powerful.

56:35.930 --> 56:37.531
Let it cook, let it cook.

56:37.565 --> 56:39.200
Are we going insane?
Are we going crazy?

56:39.233 --> 56:41.636
I feel like I'm going crazy
every damn day.

56:41.669 --> 56:42.837
She's cracking.

56:42.870 --> 56:44.805
You can't stop 'em mid crack.

56:44.839 --> 56:46.073
That's what they're doing,
Isabelle,

56:46.107 --> 56:47.708
that's what they've done to you.

56:48.609 --> 56:50.578
I can't watch,
but I can't stop watching.

56:50.611 --> 56:53.147
Are we going to take
this shit anymore?

56:53.180 --> 56:54.015
No!

56:55.549 --> 56:58.219
Is Isabelle going to
take this shit anymore?

56:58.252 --> 56:59.687
No!

57:01.088 --> 57:03.357
You got to lead
the revolution, Isabelle,

57:03.391 --> 57:05.425
and it's oh so simple.

57:05.458 --> 57:10.131
All you must do
is hit that button.

57:11.431 --> 57:13.000
Look at her face.

57:13.034 --> 57:15.169
You're not gonna stop this?

57:15.202 --> 57:16.938
We're stopping nothing,
my friend.

57:18.873 --> 57:19.974
I'm gonna stop this.

57:22.610 --> 57:24.078
What are we stopping?

57:24.111 --> 57:25.613
This? No, no, no, no.

57:25.646 --> 57:27.014
Stop crying.

57:27.048 --> 57:28.950
Stop crying right now.

57:28.983 --> 57:32.987
That's all you must do to
lead the revolution, Isabelle.

57:41.395 --> 57:42.930
She did it, folks!

57:42.964 --> 57:45.399
We're free now! And I'm free!

57:47.435 --> 57:48.402
Stop crying.

57:48.436 --> 57:49.804
Grow up.

57:49.837 --> 57:53.040
Stop your fucking crying
right now.

57:53.074 --> 57:54.108
Don't do this to me.

57:54.141 --> 57:55.042
Don't ruin this for me.

57:55.076 --> 57:55.910
Pull it together.

57:55.943 --> 57:57.311
Just stop it.

57:57.345 --> 57:58.312
- Hey, back up.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

57:58.346 --> 57:59.880
Hey. You all right?

57:59.914 --> 58:00.715
- I got it, I got it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:00.748 --> 58:02.049
She's great.

58:02.083 --> 58:03.551
- She's great.
- I'm so sorry.

58:03.584 --> 58:04.585
I'm really, really sorry,
all right?

58:04.618 --> 58:06.087
That wasn't scripted.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.555
You can't treat people
like that, okay?

58:07.588 --> 58:08.756
I told you
you couldn't go there.

58:08.789 --> 58:10.291
And I hope that you understand

58:10.324 --> 58:11.993
that we're going to
make it up to you.

58:12.026 --> 58:13.160
Do you want to get up here
and give it a try?

58:13.194 --> 58:14.095
- Guys.
- Come here, baby.

58:14.128 --> 58:15.830
Give me a kiss.

58:15.863 --> 58:17.431
- You're a straight-up psychopath.
- Jake!

58:17.465 --> 58:19.100
Back off, back off,
back off, back off.

58:19.133 --> 58:20.500
- You're a psychopath.
- Jake, you gotta stop.

58:20.534 --> 58:22.169
- You're outta line.
- I'm outta line?

58:22.203 --> 58:23.738
- Jake you gotta stop.
- That was out of line!

58:23.771 --> 58:24.972
- That was out line.
- Please calm down,

58:25.006 --> 58:26.841
- please calm down.
- Yeah.

58:26.874 --> 58:28.576
This is our head writer, Jake,
ladies and gentlemen.

58:28.609 --> 58:29.777
He's having some kind
of a nervous breakdown.

58:29.810 --> 58:31.645
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Stop.

58:31.679 --> 58:32.313
- This is fucking bullshit.
- Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

58:32.346 --> 58:33.781
Goodbye.

58:33.814 --> 58:35.449
Can you give them
a helping hand?

58:35.483 --> 58:37.018
Give him a little hand, folks.

58:37.051 --> 58:38.586
- Jake, please, okay.
- This is ridiculous.

58:38.619 --> 58:39.820
- This is the same-
- Please, calm down.

58:39.854 --> 58:41.088
Please, let's go talk about it.

58:41.122 --> 58:42.123
- Please.
- Jake, goodbye, goodbye.

58:42.156 --> 58:43.157
Take care of yourself.

58:43.190 --> 58:44.959
Get better soon. Wow.

58:44.992 --> 58:46.527
You think you know somebody,
and then you don't.

58:46.560 --> 58:47.661
Jake. Jake.
Jake, you have to calm down.

58:47.695 --> 58:48.596
He was bullying that girl.

58:48.629 --> 58:49.497
No, she's fine.

58:49.530 --> 58:51.265
I spoke to her.

58:51.298 --> 58:52.767
- We're gonna edit around it.
- No, she's not fine.

58:52.800 --> 58:54.502
She's sobbing
on the side of the stage.

58:54.535 --> 58:55.369
Look, he was trying
something new for the show.

58:55.403 --> 58:56.537
Fuck the show.

58:56.570 --> 58:57.705
Who cares about the stupid show?

58:57.738 --> 58:58.873
I do. I care about the show.

58:58.906 --> 59:00.341
I cared about the show too,

59:00.374 --> 59:01.510
when we were satirizing
awful people.

59:01.542 --> 59:03.344
Now we are the awful people.

59:03.377 --> 59:04.779
I want you to wake up
'cause you're getting swept up

59:04.812 --> 59:06.380
in this bullshit
and you'd see it

59:06.414 --> 59:08.616
if you weren't busy
slutting around with him.

59:08.649 --> 59:11.352
You're so jealous of him,
it's pathetic.

59:12.753 --> 59:13.587
I quit.

59:29.670 --> 59:30.871
[Luke]
<i>But it's up to you.</i>

59:30.905 --> 59:32.706
<i>The choice is ultimately yours.</i>

59:32.740 --> 59:33.974
What's it gonna be, Isabelle?

59:34.008 --> 59:36.243
Your phone, or your vanity?

59:44.251 --> 59:45.386
What's it going to be Isabelle?

59:45.419 --> 59:47.922
Your phone, or your vanity?

1:00:01.235 --> 1:00:02.069
Who am I?

1:00:07.374 --> 1:00:08.543
I'm worthless.

1:00:13.614 --> 1:00:14.782
I hate myself.

1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:20.621
I'm No One Special.

1:00:35.736 --> 1:00:36.571
Cut.

1:00:38.472 --> 1:00:39.807
That was great.

1:00:41.475 --> 1:00:42.710
- We got it.
- All right, well done.

1:00:42.743 --> 1:00:43.578
Good work guys.

1:00:43.612 --> 1:00:45.079
Oh, thank you.

1:00:45.112 --> 1:00:46.914
Uh, you guys can pack up
and head home.

1:00:46.947 --> 1:00:48.550
Thank you for a great day.

1:00:48.583 --> 1:00:50.484
Hey, yo, guys we got
the No One Special hats,

1:00:50.519 --> 1:00:52.587
the t-shirts,
and the baseball caps came in,

1:00:52.621 --> 1:00:54.589
so Mark has one for each of you,

1:00:54.623 --> 1:00:55.990
and take some for the family,
for the friends, and all that.

1:00:56.023 --> 1:00:57.124
We love you guys.

1:00:57.158 --> 1:00:58.726
And great work. Thank you.

1:00:58.759 --> 1:01:01.996
Okay, you think you can
get that up by tomorrow?

1:01:02.029 --> 1:01:03.063
Yeah.

1:01:03.097 --> 1:01:04.131
I can edit it tonight.

1:01:04.165 --> 1:01:06.568
Mhm.

1:01:06.601 --> 1:01:08.269
That's gonna work.

1:01:08.302 --> 1:01:09.737
Hashtag real me,
we're gonna get the views back,

1:01:09.770 --> 1:01:11.772
and what you did
with that Isabelle video

1:01:11.805 --> 1:01:13.407
and you cut around
all of her crying.

1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:15.943
It was, it's just like,
you're like a wizard.

1:01:15.976 --> 1:01:17.811
It was just like mwah.

1:01:17.845 --> 1:01:19.480
It was just perfection.

1:01:19.514 --> 1:01:21.583
It's like so fuckin' tight.

1:01:21.616 --> 1:01:22.716
That's too much, right?

1:01:23.652 --> 1:01:25.186
Yeah, it's too much.

1:01:25.219 --> 1:01:26.053
Right?

1:01:27.855 --> 1:01:29.624
You thinking about Jake?

1:01:29.658 --> 1:01:30.958
Yeah, a little.

1:01:30.991 --> 1:01:32.393
Yeah, well...

1:01:34.461 --> 1:01:35.729
It was grow or die,

1:01:37.798 --> 1:01:39.133
and he was holding us back.

1:01:41.068 --> 1:01:42.970
And this is just feeling
so right.

1:01:43.003 --> 1:01:45.806
Can you feel it?
Like we're about to go stratospheric.

1:01:49.143 --> 1:01:50.512
Looking good, looking good.

1:01:50.545 --> 1:01:51.946
All right.

1:01:51.979 --> 1:01:53.180
See right there. We got Desmond.

1:01:53.214 --> 1:01:54.982
He's amazing.

1:01:55.015 --> 1:01:56.618
New York Times
just did a huge profile on him.

1:01:56.651 --> 1:01:58.319
We got Rola right over there.

1:01:58.352 --> 1:01:59.820
Does a bit of everything:

1:01:59.853 --> 1:02:02.524
fashion, movies,
food trendsetter.

1:02:02.557 --> 1:02:06.126
Single handily brought back
cauliflower this year.

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:07.629
That's Jake Paul, blonde.

1:02:07.662 --> 1:02:10.665
He's 5.8 billion views
on YouTube.

1:02:10.699 --> 1:02:11.498
- Mhm.
- You know the story.

1:02:11.533 --> 1:02:12.967
Mhm.

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:14.134
Patrick Starr, right there,
far left.

1:02:14.168 --> 1:02:16.136
Makeup tutorial. Great.

1:02:16.170 --> 1:02:17.004
Who's that?

1:02:17.037 --> 1:02:18.239
The other blonde.

1:02:18.272 --> 1:02:19.807
Oh, the dirty blonde.

1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:21.242
That's Lana.

1:02:21.275 --> 1:02:23.244
She's fuckin',
a huge powerhouse.

1:02:23.277 --> 1:02:25.913
She does these makeup tutorials
for Christians,

1:02:25.946 --> 1:02:29.083
look fresh for Jesus,
made $200 million last year.

1:02:29.116 --> 1:02:30.484
It's fuckin' huge.

1:02:30.518 --> 1:02:31.686
- Look at that.
- That's amazing.

1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:33.354
I've never seen that.

1:02:33.387 --> 1:02:34.989
- That's a selfie train.
- Greetings, fellas.

1:02:35.022 --> 1:02:36.591
No One Special.

1:02:36.625 --> 1:02:38.058
A childhood icon.

1:02:38.092 --> 1:02:39.661
I used to be obsessed with you.

1:02:39.694 --> 1:02:40.995
Big fan.

1:02:41.028 --> 1:02:42.396
- Yeah, 10 years ago.
- Crazy.

1:02:42.429 --> 1:02:43.230
- Nice to meet you.
- 12 years ago.

1:02:44.465 --> 1:02:45.332
How are we doing? Are we set?

1:02:45.366 --> 1:02:47.001
I'm set, you set?

1:02:47.034 --> 1:02:48.435
Oh man, you really shot
the moon with that suit.

1:02:48.469 --> 1:02:49.937
You look hotter
than a five dollar Rolex.

1:02:49.970 --> 1:02:51.506
Let's do this.

1:02:51.539 --> 1:02:52.674
- Let's do it, let's do it.
- Showtime.

1:02:52.707 --> 1:02:54.074
That's great. That's great.

1:02:57.545 --> 1:02:59.046
Okay, show people.

1:02:59.079 --> 1:03:00.682
I want us to have fun,
but just know

1:03:00.715 --> 1:03:02.783
we're live streaming this
so no swearing,

1:03:02.816 --> 1:03:04.318
especially you, Desmond.

1:03:05.452 --> 1:03:07.821
And we're gonna go live
right over here.

1:03:08.789 --> 1:03:10.257
All right.

1:03:10.291 --> 1:03:12.092
Welcome back
to the Ted Wick show.

1:03:12.126 --> 1:03:14.094
That's me.

1:03:14.128 --> 1:03:15.829
I am right here with some of
your favorite influencers,

1:03:16.731 --> 1:03:19.433
and right now
we have the big guy.

1:03:19.466 --> 1:03:20.568
No One Special.

1:03:21.468 --> 1:03:24.038
I gotta say, man, I think you
and the work you do

1:03:24.071 --> 1:03:25.072
is super interesting.

1:03:25.105 --> 1:03:26.073
Thanks for being with us.

1:03:26.106 --> 1:03:27.241
No, thank you, Ted.

1:03:27.274 --> 1:03:28.976
I'm very, very happy to be here.

1:03:29.009 --> 1:03:30.745
The common thread
throughout most of your videos

1:03:30.779 --> 1:03:33.213
seems to be a comment
on the viewer's isolation,

1:03:33.247 --> 1:03:36.785
their over dependency
on social media, the internet,

1:03:36.817 --> 1:03:39.386
yet your growing popularity
is derived

1:03:39.420 --> 1:03:43.123
from your disdain,
from the very thing making you popular.

1:03:43.157 --> 1:03:44.325
Ka-pow.

1:03:44.358 --> 1:03:45.826
That's crazy, Ted.

1:03:45.859 --> 1:03:47.662
That's really insightful.
Thank you.

1:03:47.696 --> 1:03:50.331
And your biggest success
to date is kind of a game show

1:03:50.364 --> 1:03:52.634
where you demonstrate
the viewers addiction

1:03:52.667 --> 1:03:54.835
to their cell phones.

1:03:54.868 --> 1:03:58.405
Your success directly contradicts
your message, does it not?

1:03:58.439 --> 1:04:00.709
Sorry, uh, sorry, everybody,
I just,

1:04:02.343 --> 1:04:03.812
are you saying I'm a sellout,
Ted?

1:04:03.844 --> 1:04:04.978
I'm not saying anything.

1:04:05.012 --> 1:04:07.147
I'm merely asking the questions.

1:04:07.181 --> 1:04:08.282
All right, good.

1:04:08.315 --> 1:04:09.917
Good, great.

1:04:09.950 --> 1:04:12.186
See I think that you
insult the viewers.

1:04:12.219 --> 1:04:16.758
You tell them that they're
stupid for watching us.

1:04:16.791 --> 1:04:20.127
Wait, are you the person
that tells 10-year-old girls

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:21.929
to look sexy for Jesus?

1:04:21.962 --> 1:04:24.833
No. I don't tell them
how to look sexy for Jesus.

1:04:24.865 --> 1:04:26.467
Can you tell me
the passage in the Bible

1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:28.035
where they talk
about contouring?

1:04:28.068 --> 1:04:29.503
What, what is that?

1:04:29.537 --> 1:04:31.004
Is that Corinthians?
Is that Genesis?

1:04:31.038 --> 1:04:33.040
As a matter of fact, in Genesis,

1:04:33.073 --> 1:04:37.846
God commands us to take care
of all his creations,

1:04:37.878 --> 1:04:39.880
and that includes ourselves.

1:04:39.913 --> 1:04:41.982
So God is basically saying
cover up

1:04:42.015 --> 1:04:43.852
all of your so-called flaws?

1:04:43.884 --> 1:04:45.553
I need a root beer.

1:04:45.587 --> 1:04:46.621
She needs a root beer.

1:04:46.654 --> 1:04:48.556
Okay. There goes Desmond.

1:04:48.590 --> 1:04:49.990
I'm out. Goodbye.

1:04:50.023 --> 1:04:51.058
God, I love that Desmond.

1:04:51.091 --> 1:04:52.527
All right.

1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:54.895
I got to say,
what I do love about you

1:04:54.928 --> 1:04:57.464
is how you work
to empower people.

1:04:57.498 --> 1:05:00.535
Now, here is a recent clip
of your online game show.

1:05:00.568 --> 1:05:01.669
What's your secret, Isabelle,

1:05:01.703 --> 1:05:03.203
for looking so damn fresh?

1:05:04.037 --> 1:05:06.473
I drink a lot of water, I guess?

1:05:06.508 --> 1:05:08.242
Ah, Isabelle.

1:05:08.275 --> 1:05:10.244
The choice is ultimately yours.
So what's it gonna be?

1:05:10.277 --> 1:05:12.680
Is it gonna be your phone,
or your vanity?

1:05:17.685 --> 1:05:19.253
Wow.

1:05:19.286 --> 1:05:20.755
Look at that young lady,
she looks so happy.

1:05:20.789 --> 1:05:24.826
And now here is
the same clip unedited.

1:05:24.859 --> 1:05:26.393
It's just been sent to us

1:05:26.427 --> 1:05:29.831
and it kind of tells
a different story.

1:05:29.864 --> 1:05:31.398
Did you know about this?

1:05:31.432 --> 1:05:32.266
I don't know.

1:05:33.467 --> 1:05:34.501
Stop crying.

1:05:34.536 --> 1:05:36.437
Stop crying right now.

1:05:36.470 --> 1:05:41.041
That's all you must do to
lead the revolution, Isabelle.

1:05:45.479 --> 1:05:47.080
Making young girls cry.

1:05:47.114 --> 1:05:49.416
Doesn't that go against
everything you stand for?

1:05:51.051 --> 1:05:52.554
Wow, that's good.
That's very good, Ted.

1:05:52.587 --> 1:05:53.721
That's not supposed to
be out there.

1:05:53.755 --> 1:05:55.723
We, we cut that out of the show.

1:05:55.757 --> 1:05:58.225
That poor girl.
What's wrong with you?

1:05:58.258 --> 1:06:00.260
Patrick,
spare me your faux outrage,

1:06:00.294 --> 1:06:01.863
just for a second, okay?

1:06:01.896 --> 1:06:03.363
That was an outtake
and we took it out.

1:06:03.397 --> 1:06:05.065
Because you humiliated her.

1:06:05.098 --> 1:06:07.067
It's out of context.

1:06:07.100 --> 1:06:09.236
People take seconds at a time
and try to judge you for that.

1:06:09.269 --> 1:06:10.370
- Exactly.
- Only that.

1:06:10.404 --> 1:06:12.574
But now what you're doing,

1:06:12.607 --> 1:06:14.408
you're humiliating a girl in
public, so who's the hypocrite?

1:06:14.441 --> 1:06:15.577
- I didn't leak that clip.
- Fake news.

1:06:15.610 --> 1:06:17.110
It's all over the internet.

1:06:17.144 --> 1:06:18.979
You know who made
that girl cry, Ted?

1:06:19.012 --> 1:06:20.280
Not me.

1:06:20.314 --> 1:06:21.783
- It was Lana.
- Excuse me?

1:06:21.816 --> 1:06:22.983
Lana made that girl cry.

1:06:23.016 --> 1:06:24.819
- Lana, Lana-
- Oh, me?

1:06:24.853 --> 1:06:27.154
Lana is spreading toxic waste
into the culture, Ted.

1:06:27.187 --> 1:06:28.723
She is poisoning.

1:06:28.756 --> 1:06:30.625
You are, I'm sorry, baby,
but you are.

1:06:30.658 --> 1:06:32.760
You're poisoning the minds
and the souls and the hearts

1:06:32.794 --> 1:06:34.729
of young girls
throughout the country,

1:06:34.762 --> 1:06:36.798
and you are making them
soul sick

1:06:36.831 --> 1:06:40.300
because you are telling them
subliminally and insidiously

1:06:40.334 --> 1:06:41.936
that they are not enough
as they are,

1:06:41.970 --> 1:06:43.571
that they are not acceptable
as they are.

1:06:43.605 --> 1:06:45.405
That if you don't look
like a Kardashian,

1:06:45.439 --> 1:06:46.975
then you're nothing.

1:06:47.007 --> 1:06:48.442
That's the message
you're giving, Lana.

1:06:48.475 --> 1:06:50.177
And let me tell you
something else

1:06:50.210 --> 1:06:51.178
about Jesus said,
a prophet will not be accepted

1:06:51.211 --> 1:06:52.914
in his hometown.

1:06:52.947 --> 1:06:54.147
What?

1:06:54.181 --> 1:06:55.482
Oh, come on, get off the cross.

1:06:55.517 --> 1:06:56.951
We need the wood.

1:06:56.985 --> 1:07:00.755
That poor, poor, poor,
poor girl.

1:07:00.788 --> 1:07:02.122
How many poor's was that?

1:07:03.825 --> 1:07:05.092
Look, she still asked
for my number

1:07:05.125 --> 1:07:05.960
at the end of the show.

1:07:05.994 --> 1:07:07.461
Meaning what?

1:07:07.494 --> 1:07:09.096
Meaning she couldn't have been
that sad

1:07:09.129 --> 1:07:10.798
because she was still
trying to fuck me.

1:07:10.832 --> 1:07:12.634
Oh my goodness.

1:07:12.667 --> 1:07:14.101
Oh shit, this man.

1:07:14.134 --> 1:07:15.269
Why would you even
bring that up?

1:07:15.302 --> 1:07:16.604
- Okay.
- You're sick.

1:07:16.638 --> 1:07:18.171
Mr. Special, can I remind you,

1:07:18.205 --> 1:07:20.107
we are live
and there are children watching.

1:07:20.140 --> 1:07:21.543
Amen.

1:07:21.576 --> 1:07:22.677
I bring it up, Lana,
because it's all

1:07:22.710 --> 1:07:24.144
part of the same sickness.

1:07:24.177 --> 1:07:26.346
If you bag a night
with a celebrity,

1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:28.048
it's just another way of trying
to prove that you're worthy.

1:07:28.081 --> 1:07:29.817
She should know she is worthy.

1:07:29.851 --> 1:07:31.019
She shouldn't need to prove it.

1:07:31.051 --> 1:07:32.452
That's not a life.

1:07:32.486 --> 1:07:33.655
That's not a life worth living.

1:07:33.688 --> 1:07:35.023
- This...
- This dude.

1:07:36.089 --> 1:07:38.526
Why don't we talk
about your background?

1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:40.494
We tried doing
a little research on you

1:07:40.528 --> 1:07:42.797
before you came on the show
and we couldn't find anything.

1:07:42.830 --> 1:07:43.965
I know what this is.

1:07:43.998 --> 1:07:45.165
Where'd you grow up?

1:07:45.198 --> 1:07:46.968
This is the point of the show

1:07:47.001 --> 1:07:49.469
where you are trying
to resuscitate your career.

1:07:49.503 --> 1:07:51.471
Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca.

1:07:51.506 --> 1:07:52.406
- Ca!
- Take it down a notch.

1:07:52.439 --> 1:07:53.908
Did I hit a nerve?

1:07:53.942 --> 1:07:55.610
You want to know who I am, Ted?

1:07:58.378 --> 1:07:59.714
You wanna know the real me?

1:08:02.382 --> 1:08:07.589
I eat, I shit, and I'll die
like everybody else.

1:08:07.622 --> 1:08:09.057
You want me to shit, Ted?

1:08:09.089 --> 1:08:10.658
- I'll shit for you, Ted.
- Profanity.

1:08:10.692 --> 1:08:12.426
Want to see the real me?

1:08:12.459 --> 1:08:13.928
You wanna see me shit Ted?

1:08:13.962 --> 1:08:15.530
'Cause I'll, you know,
I'll, I'll shit.

1:08:15.563 --> 1:08:17.932
- Oh yeah, right.
- This is what happens, kids,

1:08:17.966 --> 1:08:22.169
when you try to attack
the system.

1:08:22.202 --> 1:08:25.006
The system will try
to attack you

1:08:25.039 --> 1:08:28.543
and the only way
to beat the system

1:08:28.576 --> 1:08:33.280
is to take a big, fat, shit
on it.

1:08:33.313 --> 1:08:34.916
- Oh my...
- Security.

1:08:34.949 --> 1:08:35.783
Woo!

1:08:37.417 --> 1:08:38.251
Woo!

1:08:39.787 --> 1:08:40.622
Ya-hoo!

1:08:42.557 --> 1:08:43.591
You want a taste, honey?

1:08:43.625 --> 1:08:45.627
Whoa, hey, hey.

1:08:45.660 --> 1:08:46.928
Mark, get 'em Mark!

1:08:47.762 --> 1:08:48.696
What's everyone afraid of?

1:08:48.730 --> 1:08:50.263
It's just play-do.

1:08:55.003 --> 1:08:56.738
Come and get me.

1:08:56.771 --> 1:08:57.772
Come and get me, come and get
me, come and get me.

1:08:57.805 --> 1:08:58.673
No, no, no, Mark!

1:08:59.774 --> 1:09:00.942
Don't touch him.

1:09:00.975 --> 1:09:02.142
I'll find someone to sue you!

1:09:02.175 --> 1:09:03.945
This is a fight for your life!

1:09:03.978 --> 1:09:05.613
This is the fight for your life!

1:09:05.647 --> 1:09:07.381
Don't watch anything.

1:09:07.414 --> 1:09:08.783
Don't view anything.

1:09:08.816 --> 1:09:10.417
Don't like anything.

1:09:10.450 --> 1:09:11.886
Don't click anything.

1:09:11.919 --> 1:09:13.888
Don't let them turn you
into zombies.

1:09:13.921 --> 1:09:15.657
They're trying to kill you,
unplug-

1:09:18.926 --> 1:09:20.260
Go, go, go, go,
drive, drive, drive.

1:09:20.293 --> 1:09:21.461
- Drive, drive!
- Go, go, go, go!

1:09:21.495 --> 1:09:23.430
- Woo!
- You are crazy!

1:09:29.037 --> 1:09:29.871
Are you okay?

1:09:33.508 --> 1:09:35.076
Hey.

1:09:35.109 --> 1:09:36.844
I gotta be at this thing.

1:09:36.878 --> 1:09:38.079
What is it?

1:09:38.112 --> 1:09:39.147
Oh, it's just some pool party

1:09:39.179 --> 1:09:40.648
Mark wants me to go to.

1:09:40.682 --> 1:09:42.449
You would hate it.
You wanna come?

1:09:42.482 --> 1:09:43.316
Okay.

1:09:49.322 --> 1:09:51.324
All right, that's my ride.

1:09:51.358 --> 1:09:52.160
I gotta go.

1:09:53.628 --> 1:09:54.461
Hey.

1:09:56.798 --> 1:09:57.632
Always us.

Thank you.

Hey.

1:11:00.928 --> 1:11:02.362
Hi.

1:11:02.395 --> 1:11:03.865
Is that your song?

1:11:03.898 --> 1:11:04.732
Yeah.

1:11:05.967 --> 1:11:07.434
It's beautiful.

1:11:07.467 --> 1:11:08.435
Thank you.

1:11:09.637 --> 1:11:10.470
I'm sorry.

1:11:11.973 --> 1:11:12.874
I'm sorry, too.

1:11:15.475 --> 1:11:16.778
I really need your help.

1:11:18.546 --> 1:11:20.748
It's all falling apart
and I need you to come back

1:11:20.782 --> 1:11:22.282
so I can put it back together.

1:11:23.651 --> 1:11:25.253
I want to go back
to the way things were.

1:11:25.285 --> 1:11:27.588
I want to incorporate
more of your ideas.

1:11:27.622 --> 1:11:28.455
I can't.

1:11:40.234 --> 1:11:42.970
Was it you that leaked
the footage of Isabelle?

1:11:43.004 --> 1:11:44.272
Wow, really?

1:11:45.173 --> 1:11:46.707
Is that why you came back here?

1:11:46.741 --> 1:11:48.276
To see if I leaked
the fucking video?

1:11:48.308 --> 1:11:49.544
You think I want to subject
that girl

1:11:49.577 --> 1:11:50.711
to even more humiliation?

1:11:50.745 --> 1:11:51.846
Who do you think I am?

1:11:54.782 --> 1:11:55.917
He's full of shit.

1:11:58.286 --> 1:11:59.287
Link?

1:11:59.319 --> 1:12:00.922
That's not even his name.

1:12:00.955 --> 1:12:02.723
He's not who he says he is.

1:12:02.757 --> 1:12:04.391
I spoke to his brother.

1:12:04.424 --> 1:12:05.960
He was the one yelling at him
in the graveyard.

1:12:06.861 --> 1:12:08.461
He's a rich kid.

1:12:08.495 --> 1:12:10.998
Really. His parents are alive.

1:12:11.032 --> 1:12:12.332
Link's parents died.

1:12:12.365 --> 1:12:13.201
No.

1:12:15.335 --> 1:12:16.838
His brother tracked us down.

1:12:17.805 --> 1:12:18.673
Here.

1:12:18.706 --> 1:12:20.274
Read this.

1:12:20.308 --> 1:12:21.309
Okay?

1:12:21.341 --> 1:12:23.244
There's a lot in here.

1:12:23.277 --> 1:12:24.444
He burned down his school.
He's been institutionalized.

1:12:24.477 --> 1:12:26.413
The family is covering it up.

1:12:26.446 --> 1:12:28.516
You can call me jealous,
you can call me pathetic,

1:12:28.549 --> 1:12:30.151
but I am telling you
he is a liar

1:12:30.184 --> 1:12:31.719
and you need to open your eyes.

1:12:36.657 --> 1:12:39.160
Why would you do this?

1:12:39.193 --> 1:12:40.862
Because I'm in love with you.

1:12:43.331 --> 1:12:44.932
And I've always been in love
with you,

1:12:44.966 --> 1:12:46.399
and I know that doesn't
even matter, but I am.

1:12:53.373 --> 1:12:54.208
I'm sorry.

1:13:18.766 --> 1:13:20.334
What do you call that?

1:13:20.368 --> 1:13:21.369
Trust me,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:13:21.401 --> 1:13:22.370
You gotta kick the habit.

1:13:22.402 --> 1:13:23.871
Do you eat peanuts?

1:13:23.905 --> 1:13:25.506
There's a lot of peanuts
in Thai food.

1:13:25.539 --> 1:13:26.374
All right,
intimacy levels are too high.

1:13:26.406 --> 1:13:27.341
Abort mission.

1:13:27.375 --> 1:13:28.743
Why'd you do that?

1:13:28.776 --> 1:13:29.977
It's beautiful,
it's a part of you.

1:13:30.011 --> 1:13:30.845
You gotta be dumb to be smart.

1:13:33.180 --> 1:13:34.582
Shit!

1:13:40.420 --> 1:13:41.555
Hey Frankie.

1:13:41.589 --> 1:13:43.024
Hey Frankie.

1:13:43.057 --> 1:13:44.491
Hey Frankie.

1:13:44.525 --> 1:13:45.526
Hey Frankie.

1:13:46.861 --> 1:13:47.862
Are you okay?

1:13:47.895 --> 1:13:49.230
I'm fine.

1:13:49.263 --> 1:13:50.564
- I just cut my hand.
- Oh, shit.

1:13:50.598 --> 1:13:51.832
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

1:13:51.866 --> 1:13:53.234
- Can I see?
- Yeah, yeah.

1:13:53.267 --> 1:13:55.903
Ow.

1:13:55.937 --> 1:13:57.171
I'm sorry.

1:13:57.204 --> 1:13:58.272
- It's okay.
- That sucks.

1:13:58.306 --> 1:13:59.407
Okay, keep pressure on it.

1:14:00.541 --> 1:14:01.943
I'll get you something.

1:14:01.976 --> 1:14:04.879
Uh, let's see
what we got in here.

1:14:04.912 --> 1:14:07.048
We're gonna fix you up.

1:14:07.081 --> 1:14:08.950
Here, this is going to be nice.

1:14:08.983 --> 1:14:09.784
Let me see.

1:14:12.485 --> 1:14:13.321
Aww.

1:14:19.060 --> 1:14:21.796
I wanted to tell you
I got this kind of big news

1:14:22.797 --> 1:14:25.333
and I didn't want to share
with anybody but you.

1:14:29.236 --> 1:14:30.972
What is it?

1:14:31.005 --> 1:14:33.341
They want me to headline
a live stream event for YouTube.

1:14:38.179 --> 1:14:43.084
And I just realized that I got
nothing to say without you.

1:14:43.117 --> 1:14:45.152
It scares me.

1:14:45.186 --> 1:14:47.822
I've never felt this way about
another human being before.

1:15:17.351 --> 1:15:22.356
<i>♪ You've gotta wonder
what the story means ♪</i>

1:15:26.994 --> 1:15:31.999
<i>♪ It's under all of us,
it goes unseen ♪</i>

1:15:33.501 --> 1:15:35.369
<i>♪ You've given your purpose ♪</i>

1:15:35.403 --> 1:15:38.639
<i>♪ Now they've taken your dream ♪</i>

1:15:38.672 --> 1:15:43.110
<i>♪ But you can't hide
behind the two extremes ♪</i>

1:15:43.144 --> 1:15:47.314
<i>♪ Your weight in the world ♪</i>

1:15:47.348 --> 1:15:48.816
I could definitely do it.

1:15:48.849 --> 1:15:51.085
Yeah, it's very easy to do.

1:15:52.553 --> 1:15:53.888
What the fuck?

1:15:55.990 --> 1:15:57.191
It's crazy.

1:15:57.224 --> 1:15:59.126
It's crazy.

1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:01.028
Imagine this place
full of people?

1:16:01.062 --> 1:16:02.663
A couple hundred
lucky ticket holders,

1:16:02.696 --> 1:16:04.698
an estimated
five million watching live.

1:16:04.732 --> 1:16:07.368
- Around the world!
- Around the world!

1:16:08.602 --> 1:16:10.171
Crazy.

1:16:10.204 --> 1:16:11.572
And Mark thinks
I can fly in from the back.

1:16:11.605 --> 1:16:12.840
Why?

1:16:12.873 --> 1:16:15.176
Spectacle is why. Look at this.

1:16:15.209 --> 1:16:17.945
But we haven't even figured out
what we're gonna say?

1:16:19.914 --> 1:16:21.849
Maybe we'll figure that out
later.

1:16:21.882 --> 1:16:23.518
And you're even gonna hear 'em
over the screaming anyway.

1:16:23.552 --> 1:16:24.553
Let me show you something.

1:16:24.585 --> 1:16:25.986
Hm?

1:16:26.020 --> 1:16:26.687
You guys wanna see
something crazy?

1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:28.155
Sure.

1:16:28.189 --> 1:16:30.724
This right here,
this is a trap door.

1:16:30.758 --> 1:16:31.859
Whoa!

1:16:31.892 --> 1:16:32.726
Oh!

1:16:50.244 --> 1:16:52.113
Roberts faced heavy trolling

1:16:52.146 --> 1:16:54.348
on social media after a clip
surfaced of the game show.

1:16:54.381 --> 1:16:57.552
Mr. Special defended his actions
at a round table discussion

1:16:57.586 --> 1:17:00.955
where he accused Ms. Roberts
of trying to seduce him.

1:17:00.988 --> 1:17:02.623
She couldn't have been that sad

1:17:02.656 --> 1:17:04.526
because she was still
trying.

1:17:04.559 --> 1:17:06.727
If you bag a night
with a celebrity,

1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:09.029
it's just another way of trying
to prove that you're worthy.

1:17:09.063 --> 1:17:11.799
She shouldn't need to prove it.
That's not a life.

1:17:11.832 --> 1:17:13.901
That's not a life worth living.

1:17:13.934 --> 1:17:15.537
Early reports suggest

1:17:15.570 --> 1:17:17.371
she hanged herself
in her bedroom closet.

1:17:17.404 --> 1:17:20.975
A coroner at the scene
says he does not believe...

1:18:49.531 --> 1:18:51.332
Mark.

1:18:51.365 --> 1:18:52.567
Mark.

1:18:53.767 --> 1:18:54.735
Have you seen this?

1:18:54.768 --> 1:18:55.803
Everybody hates me.

1:18:55.836 --> 1:18:57.171
Everyone's blaming me.

1:18:57.204 --> 1:18:59.940
It says
No One Special's canceled.

1:19:01.108 --> 1:19:02.343
This asshole
needs to burn in hell.

1:19:02.376 --> 1:19:04.011
How are we going to fix it?

1:19:04.044 --> 1:19:06.747
You told her
her life wasn't worth living.

1:19:06.780 --> 1:19:08.583
I didn't ask her
to kill herself.

1:19:10.685 --> 1:19:11.885
Are you blaming me, too?

1:19:12.753 --> 1:19:14.488
Oh, oh, oh.

1:19:14.522 --> 1:19:18.025
Wow, wow, wow, fu...

1:19:18.058 --> 1:19:19.994
A girl is dead
and all you care about

1:19:20.027 --> 1:19:21.795
is what people
are saying about you.

1:19:25.199 --> 1:19:26.800
Jake talked to your brother.

1:19:28.969 --> 1:19:32.741
Have you told me
one single thing that was true?

1:19:43.217 --> 1:19:44.051
I'm sorry.

1:19:47.589 --> 1:19:49.056
I'm sorry I didn't stop you.

1:21:05.667 --> 1:21:09.870
Hey guys, so I read the news
about Link and Isabelle

1:21:09.903 --> 1:21:11.806
and I want to apologize
for even having

1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:13.474
that guy on the show.

1:21:13.508 --> 1:21:14.642
To Isabelle,
my condolences go out to you.

1:21:14.676 --> 1:21:15.943
This makes me so mad.

1:21:15.976 --> 1:21:17.545
This could have been prevented.

1:21:17.579 --> 1:21:19.012
- What's up with this dude?
- You're a joke.

1:21:19.046 --> 1:21:20.381
- This woman is dead...
- Thrown in jail!

1:21:20.414 --> 1:21:22.483
That girl
was just a fuckin' ho...

1:21:22.517 --> 1:21:23.651
- He had very good points.
- Murderer.

1:21:23.685 --> 1:21:25.119
He killed that girl.

1:21:25.152 --> 1:21:26.320
I like
how he tells it how it is.

1:21:26.353 --> 1:21:28.055
This guy is an A-one scumbag.

1:21:28.088 --> 1:21:29.691
I think that No One Special
should be President.

1:21:29.724 --> 1:21:31.626
- I just wanna say-
- Fuck No One Special.

1:21:31.659 --> 1:21:34.729
- You suck.
- We love No One Special.

1:22:58.513 --> 1:22:59.346
Hey!

1:24:04.846 --> 1:24:07.782
I want to dedicate this
performance to Isabelle Roberts.

1:24:07.815 --> 1:24:09.817
Isabelle was an amazing girl

1:24:10.985 --> 1:24:14.121
and she passed away tragically
two days ago.

1:24:14.154 --> 1:24:16.290
I want to send out all my love,

1:24:16.323 --> 1:24:20.762
my thoughts, and my prayers
to her family and her friends.

1:24:23.031 --> 1:24:24.364
And I wanna say I'm sorry.

1:24:26.734 --> 1:24:27.569
I'm sorry.

1:24:39.747 --> 1:24:43.851
I've been told that I should
feel some responsibility

1:24:43.885 --> 1:24:45.419
for what happened and...

1:24:46.453 --> 1:24:49.389
But I can't just stand here
and...

1:24:50.558 --> 1:24:51.693
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

1:24:51.726 --> 1:24:54.062
That, that part's canceled.

1:24:54.127 --> 1:24:57.097
I can't just stand here
and accept responsibility

1:24:57.130 --> 1:24:59.701
for someone else's choices,
actions,

1:24:59.734 --> 1:25:03.103
and in fact it was you
who pushed her

1:25:03.136 --> 1:25:04.939
over the fucking cliff's edge.

1:25:07.609 --> 1:25:11.311
Yeah, you,
with your gutless trolling.

1:25:12.446 --> 1:25:14.882
You killed her, motherfucker!

1:25:14.916 --> 1:25:16.249
All of you killed her.

1:25:16.283 --> 1:25:17.619
That's the truth.

1:25:17.652 --> 1:25:18.786
And you're trying
to kill me, too,

1:25:18.820 --> 1:25:19.854
and I'm not gonna let it happen.

1:25:19.887 --> 1:25:21.221
No, not today.

1:25:21.254 --> 1:25:22.122
Not ever.

1:25:25.225 --> 1:25:27.562
Easy to talk shit when it's
behind a screen, right?

1:25:27.595 --> 1:25:29.697
What about right now?
I dare you.

1:25:29.731 --> 1:25:31.733
Come through that computer
screen you're hiding behind,

1:25:31.766 --> 1:25:34.802
stand in this room, stand face to
face, do it to my face.

1:25:34.836 --> 1:25:36.604
Anybody in the room, anybody?

1:25:41.341 --> 1:25:43.911
Look, maybe I did push Isabelle too far.
Maybe I did.

1:25:43.945 --> 1:25:47.048
I pushed her too far.
Maybe I was using her for views.

1:25:47.081 --> 1:25:49.751
I'll cop to that,
but I did it for you.

1:25:52.452 --> 1:25:54.889
You see what this shit
is doing to us?

1:25:54.922 --> 1:25:56.557
We're not real to each other
anymore

1:25:56.591 --> 1:25:58.726
and we're all
just using each other.

1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:00.327
This isn't a vi...

1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:01.829
I'm not a video game.
I'm not two dimensional.

1:26:01.863 --> 1:26:04.231
I'm not two-D.
I'm flesh and I'm blood.

1:26:04.264 --> 1:26:06.134
You're all flesh and blood.

1:26:06.166 --> 1:26:07.835
Isabelle was flesh and blood.

1:26:08.670 --> 1:26:10.104
We're all just
fucking killing each other,

1:26:10.138 --> 1:26:11.039
like it's sport.

1:26:14.042 --> 1:26:15.043
We're fucked.

1:26:16.711 --> 1:26:18.079
Oh, you want me to be nice?

1:26:18.112 --> 1:26:19.747
I almost had you, didn't I?

1:26:19.781 --> 1:26:24.018
With the candles
and the choir and the singing.

1:26:25.853 --> 1:26:28.022
That's what we want him to say.
What a good boy.

1:26:28.056 --> 1:26:29.957
He's playing so nice.

1:26:29.991 --> 1:26:31.559
We can let him back in the club.

1:26:32.694 --> 1:26:35.462
Fuck that club!

1:26:35.495 --> 1:26:37.464
I'm trying to wake you up
from that club,

1:26:37.497 --> 1:26:40.200
you numbed out,
dead inside zombies!

1:26:42.302 --> 1:26:43.938
You're all dead!

1:26:43.971 --> 1:26:44.806
You're all numb!

1:26:46.373 --> 1:26:47.809
I'm sorry.

1:26:47.842 --> 1:26:49.544
This is the first time
in my life

1:26:49.577 --> 1:26:51.445
where I felt a part
of something bigger than me,

1:26:51.478 --> 1:26:52.613
something that I don't
want to lose.

1:26:52.647 --> 1:26:53.881
I don't want to lose you,

1:26:55.817 --> 1:26:58.351
but I refuse
to let you straitjacket me!

1:27:02.389 --> 1:27:03.524
I can't.

1:27:03.558 --> 1:27:05.292
I gotta speak my truth, man.

1:27:05.325 --> 1:27:06.527
I gotta speak my truth.

1:27:06.561 --> 1:27:08.162
You know, what's crazy?

1:27:10.098 --> 1:27:11.632
I want to do what I want.

1:27:11.666 --> 1:27:13.668
I'm on the stage.
I don't give a fuck.

1:27:13.701 --> 1:27:15.169
I'll fuckin' hump the stage.

1:27:22.744 --> 1:27:26.681
I'm not gonna play
fucking Coldplay songs.

1:27:26.714 --> 1:27:29.349
I'm not gonna play
Coldplay songs.

1:27:29.382 --> 1:27:31.318
Fucking watch Coldplay!

1:27:31.351 --> 1:27:33.353
You're trying to kill my deep,
profound,

1:27:33.386 --> 1:27:34.856
life giving impulse.

1:27:34.889 --> 1:27:36.190
I'm not gonna let you do it.

1:27:36.224 --> 1:27:37.558
No! Hell no.

1:27:37.592 --> 1:27:38.425
Not today.

1:27:41.696 --> 1:27:43.531
You know what the best part
of all this is?

1:27:43.564 --> 1:27:45.199
You're just the same as me,

1:27:45.233 --> 1:27:47.869
way down there
in that deep dark pit

1:27:47.902 --> 1:27:49.537
you're afraid to look inside.

1:27:49.570 --> 1:27:51.873
I'm just the only one
that's willing to say it.

1:27:56.309 --> 1:27:58.146
My name is Alex Goodrich.

1:28:00.447 --> 1:28:01.616
I'm from Connecticut,

1:28:03.985 --> 1:28:06.621
and this is the first time
I'm telling you the truth.

1:28:09.489 --> 1:28:11.159
And all I need to know is

1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:15.395
are you with me
or are you against me?

1:28:20.134 --> 1:28:22.970
And if you're with me,
click that like button.

1:28:30.812 --> 1:28:31.646
Fuck you.

1:28:34.115 --> 1:28:35.315
You're welcome.

1:28:45.325 --> 1:28:48.262
No One Special! No One Special!

1:28:48.296 --> 1:28:50.865
No One Special! No One Special!

1:28:51.833 --> 1:28:53.568
No One Special!

1:28:53.601 --> 1:28:57.605
Special, Special,
