01:34.485 --> 01:35.767
You have no respect for me.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.749
What are you talking about?

01:37.793 --> 01:41.536
Nobody, no one will spoil
my birthday. No one.

01:47.542 --> 01:48.630
I know everything.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.762
- Like what?
- I know everything.

01:50.806 --> 01:53.939
- You don't know shit.
- Let's start with this.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.027
Who's Malmo?

01:58.857 --> 01:59.989
Malmo?

02:12.741 --> 02:13.829
I gave you everything!

02:13.872 --> 02:16.614
A job, friendship, advice!

02:16.658 --> 02:18.442
You didn't give me nothing!

02:18.486 --> 02:19.486
Aah!

02:39.681 --> 02:41.465
You know what I'm gonna do?

02:41.509 --> 02:44.512
I'm gonna confront
this Malmo fuck.

02:44.555 --> 02:46.775
And then I'm gonna deal
with Harvey after that.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.777
I'm gonna do it the right way.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.435
By that time,
it's gonna be too late.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.001
All your money's gonna be gone.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.004
I mean, this guy's stalking you.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.355
You already know he's a psycho.

03:01.398 --> 03:03.400
What we need to do
is come up with a plan.

03:03.444 --> 03:06.708
Something... something
he can't catch on to.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.586
If you remember, trust me.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.762
Friendship before money.
Can you say that?

03:17.806 --> 03:19.199
- Yeah.
- What?

03:19.242 --> 03:20.872
Come on. "Trust me,
friendship before money."

03:20.896 --> 03:21.897
- Yeah.
- Right.

One guy meet another
in a big city,

04:25.874 --> 04:27.702
they have dreams.

04:27.745 --> 04:31.096

Greed, hatred, jealousy.

04:43.979 --> 04:47.112
I'm drowning,

04:47.156 --> 04:50.028
And I wonder,
what will become of me?

06:17.072 --> 06:19.640
An ATM?
Are you kidding me?

06:19.683 --> 06:21.903
It's not an ATM.
It's a fuckin' safe.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.753
I thought you said
you saw him do that.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.842
I did! I watched him
from right over there.

06:47.885 --> 06:48.973
It doesn't matter.

06:49.017 --> 06:51.236

06:56.024 --> 06:58.853
- Jon!
- Shit!

06:58.896 --> 07:00.811
I got the wrong keys!

07:00.855 --> 07:02.247
He's got two sets of keys.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.747
- We gotta go back to the cliff.
- What do you mean?

07:03.771 --> 07:05.226
It's the only way we'll get
this thing open.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.427
- You didn't check it?
- No! I didn't check his keys

07:07.470 --> 07:08.750
as he was falling off the cliff.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.865
- Well, you should've...
- Wait! Wait.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.780
You got the car jack
in the back, right?

07:12.823 --> 07:14.279
Why don't we just take
the whole thing with us?

07:14.303 --> 07:16.958
It's an ATM machine!

07:17.001 --> 07:19.090
All right, just...

07:19.134 --> 07:20.918
It's not even bolted.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.137
Shut up!

07:22.180 --> 07:24.792
It feels like there's
so much money in here.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.796
It's gonna hurt your back.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.956
I am so tired.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.002
I can barely keep my eyes open.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.053
We're still eight hours away.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.272
That's fine, let me drive.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.475
I'm not-I'm not tired at all.

09:44.061 --> 09:45.759
What's that? Is
everything all right?

09:45.802 --> 09:49.240
Yeah... it's probably just my
boss, wondering where I'm at.

09:49.284 --> 09:52.069
Probably thinks
something happened to me.

09:52.113 --> 09:55.856
Let's get back on the road. I don't
feel comfortable just sitting out here.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.902
We're fine. We're
in the middle of nowhere.

09:58.946 --> 10:02.079
What highway are we on, anyway?
We should be on the 8.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.254
I know where I'm going.

10:34.372 --> 10:35.591
- I got this..
- Shit.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.549
Just let me
handle it. I got it.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.336
Shit.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.425
He's coming up.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.513
Fuck!

10:56.264 --> 10:57.352
Evening!

10:57.395 --> 10:59.223
Hey, officer.
How you doing?

10:59.267 --> 11:00.268
Everything okay in here?

11:00.311 --> 11:02.313
Yeah, you know, I just...

11:02.357 --> 11:05.186
I pulled over 'cause I was
starting to get a little bit tired.

11:05.229 --> 11:08.537
I noticed. I saw you
swerving back there,

11:08.580 --> 11:10.887
- in Yuma highway.
- Yeah.

11:10.931 --> 11:14.630
I recognized the worm
on the back of your car.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.677
- Tags are expired.
- What? Really?

11:17.720 --> 11:19.635
Nine months past due.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.290
My God.

11:22.333 --> 11:26.207
I'm so sorry. I'm so bad
about getting these things done.

11:26.250 --> 11:30.559
- I'll get it fixed
first thing in the morning.

11:30.602 --> 11:33.518
May I see your license
and registration, please?

11:33.562 --> 11:36.957
Yeah, sure. Jon?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.437
- Can you get that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:43.224 --> 11:46.227
There's an...
owner's manual...

11:46.270 --> 11:49.012
This is really embarrassing.

11:53.408 --> 11:57.107
I moved the paperwork out and
placed it into my other purse,

11:57.151 --> 11:58.543
and we're going through
this move,

11:58.587 --> 12:00.894
so you know how things
can kind of get jumbled up?

12:02.460 --> 12:03.418
Your license as well?

12:03.461 --> 12:05.159
Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Sorry.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.944
Yeah...

12:10.730 --> 12:14.516
Here you go.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.213
Where are you headin'?

12:16.257 --> 12:20.740
We're headin' up toward
Colorado, Estes Park?

12:20.783 --> 12:22.567
You guys coming from Mexico?

12:22.611 --> 12:24.918
No, officer, no.
No, not Mexico.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.574
What do you guys got back there?

12:29.618 --> 12:31.533
Just packing stuff.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.583
We got a call... Border
Patrol gave us a call

12:38.627 --> 12:42.065
about a minivan
fitting your description.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.589
A little suspicious.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.069
Possible smuggling.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.593
Officer, I already told you.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.073
We're just on our way
to Colorado

12:50.117 --> 12:51.683
with a bunch
of our moving stuff.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.209
Let's take a look.

12:56.471 --> 12:59.082
Please open your vehicle.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.692
No.

13:00.736 --> 13:03.043
Excuse me?

13:03.086 --> 13:06.263
According to Arizona state
law, you need my consent,

13:06.307 --> 13:10.093
or a warrant in order
to search a vehicle.

13:10.137 --> 13:14.184
Now, I'm willing to accept
a violation for expired tags,

13:14.228 --> 13:15.683
but that doesn't give you
a valid reason

13:15.707 --> 13:17.971
or probable cause
to search my vehicle.

13:20.147 --> 13:24.281
Well, you said it yourself.
Probable cause.

13:24.325 --> 13:27.284
No, I'd consider it harassment.

13:28.677 --> 13:34.117
Okay, Judge Judy.
We'll have it your way.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.076
You two sit tight.

13:47.739 --> 13:51.700
Holy fuck! Why didn't you
just let him see it?

13:51.743 --> 13:53.789
Just tell him it's a
collector's item or something.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.731
I'll let you off with a warning.

14:25.168 --> 14:29.085
You need to get off my highway
with these expired tags.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.628
There's a bed and breakfast
up the road.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.523
Oak Bar.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.525
Get this taken care of
first thing.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.138
You two have a good night.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.241
Shit! That was close.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.199
Glad we got out of that.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.203
What do you want to do?

15:00.247 --> 15:01.746
Well, let's get off
the highway, all right?

15:01.770 --> 15:05.382
If we get pulled over, we're
fucked, we lose everything.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.907
I don't really want to
stay out here, do you?

15:07.950 --> 15:09.299
Look, it's a mile away.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.360
Hello?

16:21.589 --> 16:24.157
Can I help you with something?

16:24.200 --> 16:27.812
Um... we're just looking
for a room for the night.

16:27.856 --> 16:30.337
Um, I'm sorry, but you know,

16:30.380 --> 16:33.993
this is an exclusive residence,
it's a private retreat,

16:34.036 --> 16:36.647
people book this place
five months in advance,

16:36.691 --> 16:38.649
so I don't think
we're going to be able

16:38.693 --> 16:42.305
to find anything
to accommodate you.

16:42.349 --> 16:45.526
I don't know what else
to tell you.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.966
Just one night, a few hours.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.323
Okay, all right.
Listen.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.325
Just hold on a minute.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.935
Let me check something,
and I'll be right back.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.981
So here we are.

17:50.025 --> 17:53.376
The Night Owl suite.

17:53.420 --> 17:56.249
Wait, I'm... I'm
forgetting something.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.685
I didn't tell you that breakfast

17:57.728 --> 18:00.557
is served tomorrow
6:00 to 9:00,

18:00.601 --> 18:04.866
and it's tea and crumpets,
English style.

18:04.909 --> 18:07.912
You will be joining us, right?

18:07.956 --> 18:09.914
Actually, no.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.787
We're gonna head out
early in the morning.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.069
Yeah, we just got
to hit the road,

18:14.093 --> 18:15.398
you know, get an early start?

18:18.749 --> 18:21.317
Guess you're gonna
be needing these.

18:23.885 --> 18:27.454
Just make sure you sign the
guest book before you leave...

18:29.543 --> 18:30.979
bitches.

18:48.823 --> 18:52.043
I think we got
enough to get to Colorado.

18:52.087 --> 18:54.959
All right? Tomorrow morning we
find a pickup truck or something,

18:55.003 --> 18:58.615
ditch the van...
I think we'll be fine.

18:58.659 --> 18:59.921
What?

19:01.183 --> 19:02.706
Tomorrow morning.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.753
Just get a different car,
get out of here.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.842
I really need to get
some fresh air.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.540
What's wrong?

19:23.553 --> 19:25.816
Yeah, and then the cop
just showed up.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.471
Nothing's going to plan
and I kind of need your help.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.520
Calm down.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.712
Jon, when you end up in jail,

20:35.756 --> 20:37.497
I will not rescue you, okay?

20:37.540 --> 20:39.063
The only thing what I can do,

20:39.107 --> 20:42.066
I can send you a few oranges.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.503
Tu comprends la vie?

20:53.208 --> 20:56.864
Mark my words, it will not
end up well for you. Okay?

21:46.827 --> 21:49.960
I have a feeling
that cop's gonna come back.

21:50.004 --> 21:51.547
I really think we need
to get out of here.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.070
We can't get out of here.
We have the van.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.661
We have to wait
till the morning.

21:54.704 --> 21:59.622
I made a phone call, so
someone's on the way to get us.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.755
You called somebody
to come here?

22:01.798 --> 22:03.974
Why would you do that?
That's a terrible idea!

22:04.018 --> 22:05.672
You need to chill out.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.717
This is the best bet we have.

22:12.287 --> 22:15.638
How are you gonna explain this
ATM in the back of your van?

22:15.682 --> 22:19.816
Like your creepy friend said,
it's a collector's item.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.558
That's all it is.
A safe.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.561
Who'd you call?

22:27.215 --> 22:28.608
It's my uncle.

23:22.836 --> 23:25.186
I was so worried about you.

23:25.229 --> 23:28.102
I'm glad you're okay.

23:28.145 --> 23:31.975
Give me a hug.

23:32.019 --> 23:36.589
Goddamn, it's good
to see you, lil' darling.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.292
You must be Jon.

23:44.335 --> 23:46.773
It's a pleasure to meet you.

23:46.816 --> 23:49.384
Now I know you're in a
little bit of trouble,

23:49.428 --> 23:53.127
but I'm here
to get you out of it.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.829
Holy shit!

24:01.004 --> 24:05.095
You weren't kidding!

24:05.139 --> 24:08.098
You really do need my help.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.883
Where the hell
did you get this thing?

24:12.407 --> 24:14.801
Hey, nothing
like mobile banking?

24:14.844 --> 24:20.067
Wow.
This is gonna be fun.

24:34.995 --> 24:38.128
So what brings you out
to Tucson, darling?

24:38.172 --> 24:40.783
We're just on our way
to Colorado.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.959
Colorado... you know,
I just got back

24:43.003 --> 24:45.440
from a road trip there
a few weeks back,

24:45.484 --> 24:48.791
by Harley? God dammit,
it was great!

24:48.835 --> 24:50.271
Beautiful country.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.015
Man of few words, amigo?

24:57.278 --> 24:58.497
I like him that way.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.152
No, he's just a little bit shy.

25:02.196 --> 25:04.851
We appreciate your help.

25:04.894 --> 25:08.376
Yeah, well, you can
thank me later.

25:16.819 --> 25:19.256
Now the week before that,
I had a date with a big woman.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.042
I mean big, big, big, gosh!

25:22.085 --> 25:25.088
She was big, and it was
like a wrestling match,

25:25.132 --> 25:27.413
like, "Who's gonna take who?"
I was like, "what the heck?"

25:27.438 --> 25:30.529
You know, and I hung in there,
manned up, I took her down...

25:30.572 --> 25:32.574
We had a great time.
That was fun.

25:32.618 --> 25:35.882
I gotta tell you, every once in a while
you just gotta go for that kind of stuff!

25:35.925 --> 25:37.753
You know what I'm saying, Jon?

25:37.797 --> 25:42.018
You know what I'm saying.
Good... good times.

25:44.368 --> 25:45.892
It's good to see you.

25:48.416 --> 25:50.026
How far is the ranch from here?

25:50.070 --> 25:51.854
The ranch's about
an hour and a half.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.464
We'll get there in no time.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.555
You all look a little bit tired.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.818
You know what? It's okay,
take a little catnap.

25:58.861 --> 26:01.298
Relax. I got this.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.899
Sometimes life gives you lemons.

26:36.943 --> 26:39.815
You need to make little drink.

26:39.859 --> 26:43.384
Cut the fuckin' bullshit,
all right? Who's Malmo?

26:43.427 --> 26:45.473
Jon, you never change!

26:45.516 --> 26:47.431
I'm trying
to teach you something.

26:47.475 --> 26:50.043
And you ruin everything.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.785
Where'd all
the fuckin' money go?

26:52.828 --> 26:56.615
This
was done not for money, Jon,

26:56.658 --> 26:59.095
but for friendship.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.620
To teach one friend about life.

27:01.663 --> 27:04.274
You sold our fuckin' friendship!

27:06.450 --> 27:09.932
You stole my whole goddamn idea.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.891
You will learn today, my friend,

27:11.934 --> 27:15.895
you cannot buy
or sell friendship.

27:15.938 --> 27:19.202
Or loyalty. You cannot.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.640
I know you have
secrets too, Jon.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.904
Like your bloody t-shirt.

27:24.947 --> 27:27.950
When we first met, I knew.

27:27.994 --> 27:31.606
But we'll get to that.
We'll get to the truth.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.305
All the truth, Jon.

28:28.445 --> 28:30.447
Come on in, sit down, relax.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.275
Make yourselves at home.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.500
Hey, there's food in the fridge.

28:39.543 --> 28:42.068
I'm not gonna fuckin'
babysit you.

28:47.116 --> 28:50.903
You guys are gonna
have to hang tight...

28:50.946 --> 28:54.210
while I get a little workout in.
A midnight pump.

28:56.343 --> 28:59.041
Get that look out
of your eye, Jon.

28:59.085 --> 29:01.261
Not for you.

29:12.576 --> 29:13.752
So Uncle Rick,

29:13.795 --> 29:17.668
do you think you can
open the safe for us?

29:17.712 --> 29:19.540
'Cause he lost the key,

29:19.583 --> 29:22.195
and we really need to get in.

29:22.238 --> 29:26.982
How the hell'd you fuck that up?

29:27.026 --> 29:29.289
You know, she's not
gonna put up with that shit.

29:29.332 --> 29:32.118
He's just a little
unorganized sometimes,

29:32.161 --> 29:33.423
my little bo-bo.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.643
Sorry for the inconvenience,
sir.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.953
It's Rick.

29:44.652 --> 29:47.176
What the hell's
in your safe, anyway?

29:47.220 --> 29:50.571
Let me guess:
satin bra and panties?

29:51.877 --> 29:54.793
No, I'm trying to get
into Colorado State

29:54.836 --> 29:58.405
and I left my... I left
my transfer records in there,

29:58.448 --> 30:00.581
I got a big meeting,
actually, on Monday,

30:00.624 --> 30:02.496
so I'm hoping to get in...

30:02.539 --> 30:04.280
For what?

30:04.324 --> 30:08.981
I'm trying to study...
um, bakery science.

30:09.024 --> 30:13.115
Bakery science.

30:13.159 --> 30:16.727
Holy shit! I... I've never
heard that one before.

30:16.771 --> 30:19.295
I mean, for a minute I thought
you were gonna say for football.

30:19.339 --> 30:22.168
In which case, I was gonna tell
you you need to hit the pull-up bar

30:22.211 --> 30:24.735
just a little bit more
there, pal.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.128
Unless you want to be a kicker.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.435
You know, back in the day...

30:28.478 --> 30:30.698
- What?
- Really?

30:30.741 --> 30:32.352
Not the story, not right now.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.180
- Look...
- Don't...

30:34.223 --> 30:36.704
1986, Fiesta Bowl.

30:36.747 --> 30:39.576
National TV.

30:39.620 --> 30:43.145
About an hour from here,
Sun Devil Stadium.

30:43.189 --> 30:47.106
It's 10 seconds left, 4th
and one at the goal line.

30:49.412 --> 30:52.676
I... I'm gonna run
a quarterback sneak,

30:54.461 --> 30:56.376
and this dickhead, Switzer,

30:56.419 --> 31:01.642
jumps off sides, takes me
down with a cheap shot...

31:03.557 --> 31:05.472
and blows out my ACL.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.740
Can we get back
to Jon's problem here?

31:12.783 --> 31:16.875
- Yeah, yeah... I'm sorry.
- About the safe?

31:18.833 --> 31:22.184
You know, I might be able to just rip
that thing open with my bare hands.

31:22.228 --> 31:26.710
You know, I once wrestled a
gator down in the Manchac swamp.

31:26.754 --> 31:29.539
And I kicked his ass, or his tail,
or whatever you want to call it,

31:29.583 --> 31:33.369
but I came out without a scratch.
That doesn't work,

31:33.413 --> 31:37.243
I got a Manchin garage in
the back here, full of tools.

31:37.286 --> 31:40.202
First thing in the morning,
I'll crack that thing open,

31:40.246 --> 31:43.075
you guys will be
on your way. Promise.

31:43.118 --> 31:45.729
Thank you, sir.
Sorry, I mean Rick.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.383
And you know, I'd love...

31:47.427 --> 31:48.747
love to hear
more of your stories,

31:48.776 --> 31:50.430
they sound really... really fun.

31:50.473 --> 31:52.736
No problem there, buddy,
I got you covered with those.

31:52.780 --> 31:56.610
On that note, I'm gonna
show him the backyard.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.742
Go on, guys.

31:58.786 --> 31:59.787
Make yourselves at home.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.745
I'm gonna sit back, get drunk...

32:01.789 --> 32:04.748
well, drunker,
watch a little football.

32:04.792 --> 32:07.273
Hey, go on up, really.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.231
Have some tequila, chill...

32:09.275 --> 32:10.711
You know, go take
your Snapchats,

32:10.754 --> 32:13.366
or whatever the hell
you guys do.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.237
Watch out for the rattlers.

32:15.281 --> 32:18.110
And I got a cougar stalking me.

32:18.153 --> 32:21.809
She lives next door.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.290
Yeah...

32:24.333 --> 32:25.639
Cute, though.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.817
Are you trying
to make me look bad?

32:29.860 --> 32:33.821
Bakery science? Really? Where
in the hell'd that come from?

32:33.864 --> 32:37.129
I just tried to come up with
some shit, I don't know...

32:37.172 --> 32:40.654
- Weird.
- It was your terrible idea to come here.

32:40.697 --> 32:43.309
Come on, your uncle, he's
not gonna fall for this.

32:43.352 --> 32:46.834
You didn't tell me your
uncle was Clint Eastwood.

32:46.877 --> 32:49.489
Look, Jon, I know
where your head's at.

32:49.532 --> 32:53.275
Okay? It was
an accident.

32:53.319 --> 32:56.365
If the roles were reversed,
he wouldn't have cared.

32:56.409 --> 33:01.501
I just... I just wish I'd
confronted him one more time.

33:01.544 --> 33:05.418
- He wouldn't have listened.
- No, maybe he would have.

33:07.855 --> 33:11.598
Look... by the time
anything's discovered,

33:11.641 --> 33:15.732
okay, we're gonna be
all the way in Colorado.

33:15.776 --> 33:17.865
It's not even gonna matter.

33:21.869 --> 33:23.914
Is this really worse...

33:26.265 --> 33:29.529
than going back
to having nothing?

33:29.572 --> 33:32.314
Well, he was my best friend.

33:32.358 --> 33:35.622
I mean, he's all I had.
He was my only friend.

33:35.665 --> 33:39.930
He was not your best friend!
He wasn't even a friend!

33:39.974 --> 33:42.759
How can you not see that? He
was blatantly ripping you off.

33:42.803 --> 33:45.893
I know, I know,
I got it, all right?

33:45.936 --> 33:47.721
Look, I just... I need
some time alone.

33:49.853 --> 33:52.421
It's not... it's
not you, it's me.

34:12.485 --> 34:15.531
Guess what? We're
in a dark room, Jon,

34:15.574 --> 34:18.578
and we are the light.

34:47.389 --> 34:50.610
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

35:01.099 --> 35:04.058
Yeah, I killed
that one by accident.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.581
Hey, I'm not interrupting, am I?

35:05.625 --> 35:07.757
- No, not at all.
- Good.

35:07.801 --> 35:09.977
Hey, I mixed you up
a little nightcap.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.892
Call it "Mother's Milk."

35:11.935 --> 35:14.416
Put a little lead
in your pencil.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.026
Okay.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.985
You'll sleep like a baby.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.023
It's better if you
do it in one big shot.

35:29.823 --> 35:31.129
There you go.

35:33.522 --> 35:35.872
Well, listen, um...
get some sleep.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.961
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

35:38.005 --> 35:39.049
Good night.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.925
You know, you had a long day.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.666
Why don't you get some rest?

35:46.709 --> 35:48.774
I'm gonna go watch some TV with
Uncle Rick for a little bit.

35:48.798 --> 35:51.018
- All right.
- All right?

36:50.817 --> 36:53.950
Good luck
at Colorado State, Jon.

36:53.994 --> 36:58.825
I got your ATM, cracked
wide fuckin' open for you.

36:58.868 --> 37:01.523
Got your transfer papers
on the kitchen table.

37:01.567 --> 37:04.526
You're gonna make
one hell of a baker

37:04.570 --> 37:06.006
with all that dough in there.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.458
What did I teach you?
Friendship before money, Jon.

37:23.502 --> 37:26.113
You never learn.

37:26.156 --> 37:29.116
I warned you to listen.
They're coming after you now.

37:35.949 --> 37:39.082
Soon, everybody in the world
will know what you did.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.008
Do you feel evil, Jon?

37:52.052 --> 37:54.054
Do you?!

37:55.751 --> 37:58.493
You drive me crazy, Jon!

38:02.671 --> 38:06.545
Evil man!
Burn in hell!

38:14.161 --> 38:15.989
Hey, you up?

38:23.953 --> 38:25.999
I really wanted
to let you sleep in,

38:26.042 --> 38:29.742
but Rick's been at it all night, and
he still can't get that safe open.

38:41.188 --> 38:43.625
No dice, amigo.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.932
Where the hell did you
get this box?

38:48.064 --> 38:49.718
My-my friend gave it to me.

38:49.762 --> 38:51.261
You know, he said I
could use it as a safe.

38:51.285 --> 38:52.982
And then it just...

38:53.026 --> 38:54.332
It's just a novelty thing,
right?

38:54.375 --> 38:55.594
Yeah.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.683
All right, come here, look.

38:59.641 --> 39:01.730
It's got two locks, right?

39:01.774 --> 39:06.082
But in between the two, there's
some kind of electronic barrier.

39:06.126 --> 39:08.607
I mean, this is aftermarket.

39:08.650 --> 39:11.087
It's black market, I don't
know what the fuck it is,

39:11.131 --> 39:14.308
but it's being a bitch to open.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.877
Kinda like a few
of the women I dated.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.662
When the hell's the last time
you opened it?

39:20.706 --> 39:22.272
Rick.

39:22.316 --> 39:24.536
- He doesn't know. Leave him alone.
- He doesn't know?

39:24.579 --> 39:26.146
- No.
- All right.

39:26.189 --> 39:28.670
All right, I'll keep busy.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.239
You're dead.

39:36.591 --> 39:37.810
- Hey, Rick?
- Yeah?

39:37.853 --> 39:39.855
You got a computer I can use?

39:39.899 --> 39:41.683
Yeah, it's in the office.

39:41.727 --> 39:45.339
Guest passcode is FU1986.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.037
- FU?
- Yeah, you know, fuck you.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.648
Okay.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.102
Jon, what are you doing?

40:10.625 --> 40:12.584
I need to find out
who that guy was.

40:12.627 --> 40:14.736
- And we really need to get going.
- The guy at Harvey's shed

40:14.760 --> 40:16.868
he was giving money to.
I need to find out who he was.

40:16.892 --> 40:17.937
Well, I got it.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.375
- You got in?
- No.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.724
But I got an idea.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.900
Look, I'm thinking Tombstone.

40:24.944 --> 40:28.861
I know this old bastard
up there, Doc Seagar.

40:28.904 --> 40:31.733
He can open up
just about anything.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.082
It's gonna cost you
a little bit,

40:33.126 --> 40:35.737
but... I think it's
our best bet.

40:37.696 --> 40:40.916
- It's worth a shot.
- Yeah. Sure.

40:44.137 --> 40:45.921
All right.

41:10.293 --> 41:12.992
All right, Traci. Run on
in there and get the ball rolling.

41:13.035 --> 41:14.341
Why me?

41:14.384 --> 41:17.779
Well... Doc Seagar,
he likes beautiful women.

41:17.823 --> 41:18.998
You know, it ups our chances

41:19.041 --> 41:21.783
he might give you a better deal.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.655
Yeah, okay.
Whatever.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.179
Attagirl.
Thanks.

41:30.226 --> 41:31.793
- Hey, Trace?
- Yeah?

41:31.837 --> 41:33.665
Don't tell him it's
an ATM, all right?

41:33.708 --> 41:36.972
- Let me do all the explaining.
- Okay.

41:46.199 --> 41:48.027
Hello?

42:25.281 --> 42:28.241
How long you've been seeing her?

42:28.284 --> 42:29.895
A few months now.

42:29.938 --> 42:32.245
Few months? Hell, that
explains everything.

42:32.288 --> 42:35.553
Your dick's been
pink steel 24/7, right?

42:35.596 --> 42:36.989
And let me guess, you run out,

42:37.032 --> 42:38.817
get yourself a little
engagement ring,

42:38.860 --> 42:41.515
and like a knucklehead
you throw it in the safe,

42:41.559 --> 42:44.126
lose the key,
here you are. Right?

42:45.911 --> 42:48.783
Hey, there. What can I
do you for, miss?

42:48.827 --> 42:51.438
I have a safe that
I need help opening.

42:53.179 --> 42:54.354
You look familiar.

42:54.397 --> 42:56.965
You used to have
different hair or something.

42:57.009 --> 42:59.446
- You from around here?
- No.

42:59.489 --> 43:03.232
I'm from out of town, so you
must be thinking of someone else.

43:03.276 --> 43:04.930
Right...

43:04.973 --> 43:06.975
Well, you know
what model the safe is?

43:07.019 --> 43:11.589
I think it's best
we bring it in here.

43:11.632 --> 43:13.765
Here?

43:14.940 --> 43:17.290
No. Not here.

43:19.248 --> 43:22.425
Dad doesn't like any hanky-panky
going on in the shop.

43:22.469 --> 43:24.340
Doc's orders.

43:24.384 --> 43:28.301
Doc Seagar knows my uncle.
Rick Stanton?

43:30.477 --> 43:33.045
How about you? What
are you doing for work?

43:33.088 --> 43:35.264
Well, I'm not doing
any male stripping,

43:35.308 --> 43:36.831
if that's what you
were hoping for.

43:38.224 --> 43:40.443
Hell, I run
my own construction company.

43:40.487 --> 43:43.403
I mean, how else do you think
I know dirtbags like this guy?

43:45.318 --> 43:47.929
Now you listen here.

43:47.973 --> 43:50.323
No sticky Stanton,

43:50.366 --> 43:52.020
no extracurricular activities.

43:52.064 --> 43:55.284
That stuff doesn't
go on in here.

43:55.328 --> 43:57.635
Dad prefers a private location.

43:57.678 --> 43:59.158
Okay.

43:59.201 --> 44:01.551
When's the soonest
you can come out?

44:01.595 --> 44:05.512
- Out where?
- To our ranch.

44:05.555 --> 44:08.950
- Soon as today, if the money's right.
- 00 p.m., I reckon.

44:12.519 --> 44:15.522
Just jot down your information
here and fork over some cash.

44:15.565 --> 44:18.830
If you need an ATM,
there's one in town.

44:22.050 --> 44:25.358
It's not an issue.
Just be there at 4:00.

44:28.317 --> 44:29.492
Right.

44:58.086 --> 45:01.133
Hey, Uncle Rick, how you doin'?
We need your help.

45:01.176 --> 45:03.396
We lost the key.
It's just a little safe.

45:04.919 --> 45:06.268
You can open up that.

45:12.971 --> 45:15.669
This whole thing's starting
to smell like shit.

46:25.434 --> 46:26.827
Jon...

46:26.871 --> 46:29.699
You're lying to yourself.
You cannot handle truth.

46:29.743 --> 46:32.746
Can you fuckin' take
that thing off?

46:32.790 --> 46:36.141
You know why I make
this mask of you, Jon?

46:38.752 --> 46:41.320
We both have something
in common, Jon.

46:41.363 --> 46:44.105
We both survived scary fall.

46:44.149 --> 46:46.629
You never tell me
about your fall.

47:15.354 --> 47:19.184
When exactly did you
lose your mom? Remember?

47:34.068 --> 47:37.550
You are flying, Jon.
What were you feeling?

48:05.491 --> 48:10.104
Yeah, I see you as a lemon, man.

48:10.148 --> 48:12.672
You were saved
by the little tree...

48:45.270 --> 48:48.751
Why you trying
to destroy yourself, Jon?

48:48.795 --> 48:50.753
Do you realize how dangerous

48:50.797 --> 48:53.365
lack of human connection,
friendship, can be?

48:53.408 --> 48:57.108
You surround yourself
with strange people,

48:57.151 --> 48:58.326
wrong vibration. Heh.

49:09.511 --> 49:13.646
Yeah... Tell me about it.

49:35.276 --> 49:37.844
Doc Seagar, the living legend.
How are you?

49:37.887 --> 49:39.759
Not an easy place to find.

49:39.802 --> 49:42.283
- Are you on foot?
- Always.

49:42.327 --> 49:44.459
Listen, kids here,
they're from out of town.

49:44.503 --> 49:46.200
They've got a little problem.

49:46.244 --> 49:49.203
Young lady tells me you've got
something giving you trouble.

49:49.247 --> 49:51.466
That's right. We've got
a box that needs opening.

49:51.510 --> 49:53.512
Come on over, I'll show you.

50:03.696 --> 50:06.264
Hey, look!
It's my ex wife.

50:06.307 --> 50:07.482
She had all the money.

50:07.526 --> 50:11.486
An ATM. What fun!

50:11.530 --> 50:14.794
- What's in it?
- Just some of my school documents.

50:14.837 --> 50:17.318
Well, you're a smart
little bastard, aren't you?

50:17.362 --> 50:19.340
- I don't know about this one.
- I don't either.

50:19.364 --> 50:20.604
Let me check the serial number.

50:24.804 --> 50:26.893
Does this have
a memory device in it?

50:26.936 --> 50:29.809
I have no idea.

50:37.730 --> 50:40.559
You know, Doc and I here,

50:40.602 --> 50:43.388
we share the same girl
down at the massage parlor.

50:43.431 --> 50:47.609
He goes first,
I get the happy ending.

50:49.394 --> 50:53.702
An old ATM model.
Something's not right.

50:53.746 --> 50:56.618
Serial number only
has nine digits.

50:56.662 --> 50:58.316
Where'd you get this baby?

50:58.359 --> 51:00.318
Beats me.

51:00.361 --> 51:02.276
Elaborate little setup,
double locks.

51:02.320 --> 51:04.800
You don't have a key
for either, I presume?

51:04.844 --> 51:07.325
- You know, look,
we're in a bit of a rush here,

51:07.368 --> 51:10.502
we don't have time for 20
questions, we just want it opened.

51:10.545 --> 51:13.548
Well, maybe you should find
yourself another locksmith, then,

51:13.592 --> 51:16.377
one that doesn't mind
messing with a stolen ATM.

51:16.421 --> 51:18.249
It's not stolen.

51:18.292 --> 51:20.966
You're the dudes who knocked off Gus'
Liquor the other night, aren't you?

51:20.990 --> 51:22.992
For fuck's sake!

51:23.036 --> 51:26.561
Maybe you'd like to explain the
situation to the Pima County Sheriff.

51:26.605 --> 51:28.085
I'll get him on the line
for you.

51:28.128 --> 51:29.912
God dammit, Doc!

51:29.956 --> 51:32.611
You know what? Could you
just help us out here?

51:32.654 --> 51:35.503
I mean, nobody likes a box they can't
open any more than I do, all right?

51:35.527 --> 51:38.573
The kids here, they
don't want any trouble.

51:38.617 --> 51:40.662
You're talkin' to me
like you know me.

51:40.706 --> 51:42.664
Let's cut the bullshit.

51:42.708 --> 51:46.059
I can open this thing
but it is going to cost you.

51:48.714 --> 51:51.543
Um, here. We don't
want any trouble.

51:51.586 --> 51:54.372
That's fuckin' chump change! I'm
naming the price for this thing.

51:54.415 --> 51:56.417
Christ! You're
just opening up a lock.

51:56.461 --> 51:58.376
But first things first.

51:58.419 --> 52:00.769
I'm gonna have to have
a whisky over ice.

52:00.813 --> 52:02.815
Gotta unwind from my walk.

52:02.858 --> 52:06.819
I'll open this thing for you,
but after I finish my drink.

52:09.169 --> 52:10.953
Man, we'll get right on it.

52:12.825 --> 52:13.826
Come on, guys.

52:31.670 --> 52:33.628
I oughta stir this thing
with my dick.

52:35.456 --> 52:36.631
How far are you willing to go

52:36.675 --> 52:38.459
trying to get this thing open?

52:38.503 --> 52:42.115
You got another grand?
You got that kind of coin?

52:42.159 --> 52:43.551
Let's just do what we gotta do.

52:43.595 --> 52:45.379
All right? Let's
just get it open.

52:51.429 --> 52:53.082
Vinny! Vinny!

52:53.126 --> 52:56.912
You gotta get your ass
over here A.S.A.P.

52:56.956 --> 52:59.872
We got ourselves a golden goose!

53:01.047 --> 53:02.875
Yeah, Sticky Stanton's!

53:05.051 --> 53:06.792
All right, get over here!

53:11.536 --> 53:14.408
It's not just college transfer
papers in there, is it?

53:16.454 --> 53:18.847
Look, I don't give
a shit what's in it,

53:18.891 --> 53:21.154
I just wanna help you guys
get it open, all right?

53:23.069 --> 53:25.114
Let's go.

53:25.158 --> 53:27.465
I feel like kicking him
right in the pussy.

53:42.610 --> 53:45.961
Let the good times roll!

53:46.005 --> 53:48.529
- Here you go.
- Let the fun begin!

53:48.573 --> 53:51.445
Look, we're gonna give you
an added bonus of $1,000

53:51.489 --> 53:53.534
if you can crack it open
within the hour.

53:53.578 --> 53:55.536
No, no, no no, no!

53:55.580 --> 53:57.166
This is gonna take
way more than an hour.

53:57.190 --> 53:59.801
We have to give this
the nitric acid treatment.

53:59.845 --> 54:01.803
You just plan to
chill out for a while.

54:01.847 --> 54:05.024
Nitric acid?
Well, shucks.

54:05.067 --> 54:07.069
How about I make it 1,500?

54:07.113 --> 54:08.593
You guys are awfully anxious

54:08.636 --> 54:11.073
to get in there
for just a few papers.

54:11.117 --> 54:14.425
Value's written
all over your faces.

54:14.468 --> 54:17.079
You're gonna have to lay
25 grand on me,

54:17.123 --> 54:19.212
or this thing is toast.

54:19.256 --> 54:21.649
You know what?
I'm sick of your shit.

54:21.693 --> 54:23.564
I'm tired of you
blackmailing us.

54:23.608 --> 54:24.783
Give us our money back,

54:24.826 --> 54:27.089
and I want your shriveled,
geriatric ass

54:27.133 --> 54:28.743
off my fucking property.

54:28.787 --> 54:30.025
You know, I called
a friend over.

54:30.049 --> 54:31.790
I hope you don't mind.

54:36.621 --> 54:39.101
- Fuck...
- Hand it over.

54:39.145 --> 54:40.233
Hand it over!

54:42.627 --> 54:44.585
Get over here, against the wall.
Come on!

54:44.629 --> 54:46.195
Get the fuck over here!

54:47.849 --> 54:49.503
Faster! Come on!

54:55.988 --> 54:57.772
And here he comes.
Get back against the wall!

54:59.252 --> 55:00.558
Fucker!

55:03.648 --> 55:04.648
Eyes forward, come on!

55:38.639 --> 55:41.120
What the fuck is this party?

55:41.163 --> 55:43.252
Yeah, they brought me
this stolen ATM.

55:43.296 --> 55:46.734
I can't get it open, they
won't tell me what's in it.

55:46.778 --> 55:49.868
But I bet you it is
a king's ransom!

55:51.652 --> 55:56.048
- Whose fuckin' safe is this?
- It's mine.

55:57.832 --> 55:59.070
Why are you being a little bitch

55:59.094 --> 56:01.183
and giving Doc here a hard time?

56:01.227 --> 56:04.796
Look, hombre, we just want the
damn thing open, all right?

56:04.839 --> 56:06.537
I just got some tools
in there, that's it.

56:06.580 --> 56:07.949
We just need your...

56:07.973 --> 56:09.757
Now it's tools you got in there.

56:09.801 --> 56:12.238
See that, chica?

56:13.674 --> 56:15.284
Do you remember me?

56:15.328 --> 56:17.243
What's your name?

56:17.286 --> 56:19.071
Um... I'm Miranda.

56:19.114 --> 56:21.160
I noticed right away.

56:21.203 --> 56:23.118
Your eyes...

56:24.642 --> 56:25.686
You're the one.

56:25.730 --> 56:26.881
Hey, lay off the girl.

56:26.905 --> 56:31.039
Doc...

56:31.083 --> 56:33.172
- it's her.
- I don't know you.

56:33.215 --> 56:35.914
- It's her, Doc.
- Shit!

56:35.957 --> 56:39.700
I haven't seen you in six years.

56:39.744 --> 56:41.615
I promised you, m'hija,

56:41.659 --> 56:44.226
your Mom took you from me!

56:44.270 --> 56:45.663
I don't know you.

56:45.706 --> 56:47.708
I promised I'd kill
seven, m'hija.

56:47.752 --> 56:50.624
By gun, by hand,

56:50.668 --> 56:53.322
by rope, by car,

56:53.366 --> 56:58.806
by water, by fire,
and finally...

56:58.850 --> 57:00.591
by knife!

57:00.634 --> 57:02.264
- Dies irae, dies illa...
- I don't know you!

57:02.288 --> 57:04.248
- Solvet saeclum in
favilla...- Get away from me!

57:04.290 --> 57:05.930
Teste Satan cum sibylla...

57:08.468 --> 57:10.731
Get the fuck back to the wall!

57:17.999 --> 57:19.000
Get back there!

57:27.139 --> 57:28.401
Do not move.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.621
- Come to me my baby!
- What're you doing?!

57:30.664 --> 57:31.839
Come to me, my baby!

57:31.883 --> 57:35.756
Vinny! I told you
to open the safe first.

57:35.800 --> 57:39.020
You can torture and do
your satanic shit after.

57:39.064 --> 57:43.111
I know you're fucking in there!
I know you're fucking in there!

57:44.199 --> 57:46.375
Don't you look at me, goddammit!

57:48.116 --> 57:50.728
- Rick!
- My God!

57:54.819 --> 57:56.298
Ay, ay, ay...

57:56.342 --> 57:57.952
I know you're in there, baby.

58:00.868 --> 58:03.305
I'm gonna get you.

58:03.349 --> 58:05.960
Come on, baby.
Come on.

58:35.816 --> 58:37.818
Vinny! Vinny!

58:37.862 --> 58:40.081
Fuck you!

58:40.125 --> 58:43.781
Fuck you!

59:02.408 --> 59:05.193
Traci!

59:05.237 --> 59:07.369
Trace?

59:16.378 --> 59:17.902
Traci?

59:17.945 --> 59:20.034
Shit, are you okay?

59:20.078 --> 59:21.819
Fuck.

59:21.862 --> 59:26.127
Who the hell shot Santa Claus
and his elf here?

59:26.171 --> 59:27.520
It wasn't you?

59:29.478 --> 59:32.046
Shit! Come on, come
on, come on, down, Jon.

59:32.090 --> 59:34.440
Down. Let's go.

59:53.111 --> 59:56.157
Why you trying to destroy
yourself, Jon?

59:56.201 --> 59:58.812
Why jealousy, hatred, greed?

01:00:00.858 --> 01:00:03.991
You only attract other
people with same emotion,

01:00:04.035 --> 01:00:05.427
dangerous people.

01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:07.081
I told you, Jon.

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:10.128
I said you couldn't trust her.

01:00:20.965 --> 01:00:24.272
What really happened
with that woman?

01:00:24.316 --> 01:00:27.188
Did you do anything to her?
Did you hurt her?

01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:31.410
Jon... she was my life.
She was everything.

01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:33.151
Do you understand?

01:00:46.338 --> 01:00:50.298
Her body was found completely
destroyed and tore apart.

01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:56.827
Her face ruined and slashed.

01:01:04.051 --> 01:01:07.228
Police doesn't want
to hear truth.

01:01:07.272 --> 01:01:10.579
They call it unsolved crime of the century.

01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:23.027
They transform Elizabeth into
a dark fantasy of Black Dahlia.

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:26.334
I transform myself
like a phantom of opera.

01:01:26.378 --> 01:01:29.163
Love and tragedy, Jon.

01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:32.036
I see it in your eyes.

01:01:51.011 --> 01:01:56.103
Colorado State, Jon?

01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:59.019
ATM.

01:02:01.239 --> 01:02:04.416
College transfer papers, Jon?

01:02:07.332 --> 01:02:09.551
I don't think you're going
to get into Colorado State

01:02:09.595 --> 01:02:12.250
the way you've been
handling this job.

01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:14.600
You're fucking everything up.

01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:21.433
Keep your heads down, guys.

01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:25.611
Traci, not that far down.

01:02:28.048 --> 01:02:32.052
You know, I hope you know...
because of you and your fucking up,

01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:34.359
we got two fucking
bloated bodies out there

01:02:34.402 --> 01:02:36.753
the javelinas
are gonna start chewing on.

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:38.406
What do you think about that?

01:02:41.627 --> 01:02:44.238
You don't give
a goddamn, do you?

01:02:44.282 --> 01:02:47.372
Well, I'll tell you what, I'm holding
you responsible for this shit.

01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:48.460
Jon...

01:02:51.637 --> 01:02:54.248
You're a fuck-up.

01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:57.251
This whole ATM thing,
it's just fucked.

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:01.299
I mean, are you this much
of a fuck-up in real life?

01:03:07.131 --> 01:03:10.264
What does she see in you?
Did she find you under a bridge?

01:03:13.354 --> 01:03:17.532
What a fucking pussy, man. I can
hear your heart beating from here.

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:22.755
Don't fucking disappoint me.

01:03:24.278 --> 01:03:25.584
Tomorrow is a big day.

01:03:27.281 --> 01:03:30.023
We gotta get the fuck
out of here alive.

01:03:49.347 --> 01:03:50.652
Well...

01:03:50.696 --> 01:03:54.831
if they wanted to kill us,
they would've.

01:03:54.874 --> 01:03:57.137
You know, maybe it's a vendetta

01:03:57.181 --> 01:03:59.270
against Doc
and that black rat of his.

01:04:01.446 --> 01:04:03.317
Maybe somebody
followed him here.

01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:05.798
Or it could be the drug
lords looking out for me.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:09.715
Hell, it could be that crazy cougar
lady neighbor friend of mine.

01:04:09.758 --> 01:04:11.412
She's a pretty good shot.

01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:16.374
Jon, come here, come here.

01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:20.291
What about that friend of yours,
the guy who gave you the safe?

01:04:20.334 --> 01:04:21.858
Maybe he had
something to do with this.

01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:23.207
Did he have anybody after him?

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:24.686
I don't know.
Maybe, yeah.

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:25.862
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:29.300
I think there might be.
Now listen, Jon,

01:04:29.343 --> 01:04:30.867
every once in awhile in life,

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:33.521
your balls gotta get
a little bit bigger.

01:04:33.565 --> 01:04:35.132
And now's the time.

01:04:35.175 --> 01:04:38.309
I need you to go out to the
garage and get the guns.

01:04:38.352 --> 01:04:40.398
They're in an army duffel bag,

01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:43.183
in a box
behind the white Impala.

01:04:43.227 --> 01:04:45.533
Check for ammo, all right?

01:04:45.577 --> 01:04:48.449
Traci needs this,
I need this. We need you.

01:04:48.493 --> 01:04:49.581
- Army?
- Yeah.

01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:51.626
It's green,
it's an army duffel bag.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:53.628
You can do this, all right?

01:06:34.468 --> 01:06:35.948
It's a one of a kind,

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.820
and I said yeah, I'm a one
of a million too, right?

01:06:38.864 --> 01:06:40.779
I'm special, I'm unique.

01:06:45.784 --> 01:06:47.742
My little baby!

01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:50.397
I can lick it.

01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:52.312
- Come on.

01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:55.489
Let's go for spin!

01:07:20.514 --> 01:07:22.777
How the fuck did Harvey's car
get into Rick's garage?

01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:24.214
What are you talking about?

01:07:24.257 --> 01:07:25.930
- Did you know about this?
- What're you talking about?

01:07:25.954 --> 01:07:27.391
Harvey's car is
in Rick's garage.

01:07:27.434 --> 01:07:29.784
- Those are Rick's cars.
- No, they're not.

01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:31.066
Now either
you tell me the truth,

01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:32.396
or I'm going to the cops.

01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:35.268
- That's impossible.
- Where the hell is Rick?

01:07:38.532 --> 01:07:42.406
Speak of the devil
and he shall appear.

01:07:43.755 --> 01:07:47.019
Now you're not
going anywhere, pal.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:51.023
And what the fuck
were you doing in my shit?

01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:56.246
What a pain in the ass you are.

01:07:56.289 --> 01:07:58.770
I've never had this much
trouble with anybody else.

01:08:00.728 --> 01:08:04.515
And you...
Come here.

01:08:26.971 --> 01:08:28.626
Finish packing, baby.

01:08:34.805 --> 01:08:36.808
Now I know what you're thinking.

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:40.768
Did I fuck her
five or six times?

01:08:40.812 --> 01:08:42.466
Well, to tell you the truth,

01:08:42.509 --> 01:08:45.469
with all that excitement,
I forgot.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.777
We've been doing
this shit for years.

01:08:49.821 --> 01:08:53.433
I can't tell you how many bodies
I got buried up in the hills.

01:09:27.902 --> 01:09:32.037
Now Jon, I don't really want
to have to kill you.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.080
But I don't mind.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.564
Now here, put these cuffs on.

01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:42.439
Put 'em on.

01:09:44.702 --> 01:09:46.399
It looks like
your kind of jewelry.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.099
Now move.

01:10:29.137 --> 01:10:32.532
Come on.

01:10:32.576 --> 01:10:35.883
All right...

01:10:35.927 --> 01:10:37.102
Pull over.

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:42.629
You know, Jon,

01:10:42.673 --> 01:10:46.459
you could've gone back
to being a nobody.

01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:48.505
But now?

01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:52.683
You're gonna die like a
stray dog in the desert.

01:10:58.689 --> 01:11:02.258
Then I'm gonna head
back to the ranch,

01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:03.998
I'm gonna burn through that safe

01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:08.089
now that Doc and that baby
burrito of his are out of the way.

01:11:15.619 --> 01:11:20.580
Traci and I are gonna catch
a flight to the Caymans.

01:11:20.624 --> 01:11:24.497
And I won't have to hear
you bitch ever again.

01:11:28.632 --> 01:11:30.068
Move.

01:11:38.598 --> 01:11:40.078
Down there, let's go.

01:12:09.063 --> 01:12:10.543
Right up here.

01:12:13.633 --> 01:12:15.809
Right there, down.
Get on your knees.

01:12:18.638 --> 01:12:21.641
Nice place to die, Jon?

01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:24.078
I owe you that much.

01:12:24.122 --> 01:12:26.820
This is where I take
everybody to kill.

01:12:26.864 --> 01:12:29.345
What did you do
with my friend's body?

01:12:29.388 --> 01:12:32.826
I didn't do anything
with your friend's body.

01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:35.699
He probably washed out to sea.

01:12:35.742 --> 01:12:40.834
I was just supposed to pick up
the car and get it out of there.

01:12:40.878 --> 01:12:43.054
And nice car, by the way.

01:12:43.097 --> 01:12:46.318
One of my favorites.
Your buddy had good taste.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:49.321
We were then supposed to
meet you at the gas station.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.845
Get the keys from you
and then ditch you.

01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:54.674
But you and your buddy
had a little catfight,

01:12:54.718 --> 01:12:59.070
started bitchslapping each
other and he went skydiving.

01:13:14.215 --> 01:13:16.870
There's no such thing as love.

01:13:16.914 --> 01:13:19.220
Jesus, you think
Traci loved you?

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:24.051
Hell, I was fucking her
so hard last night,

01:13:24.095 --> 01:13:26.924
I thought there was gonna be
a headboard homicide.

01:13:26.967 --> 01:13:30.231
And you were right in the next room.
You think she cared?

01:13:30.275 --> 01:13:31.581
Hell no.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.412
But I tell you what...

01:13:36.455 --> 01:13:39.240
Jesus, Jon, you look
like a schoolgirl

01:13:39.284 --> 01:13:41.068
that's just seen
her first pecker.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.118
Traci and I do have an
understanding about one thing.

01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:50.426
Life's a lot easier
if you don't give a shit.

01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:52.384
About anything.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:57.128
I learned that
after my first kill.

01:13:57.171 --> 01:13:59.304
My ex-wife.

01:13:59.347 --> 01:14:01.045
Hell, she deserved it, Jon.

01:14:01.088 --> 01:14:03.221
Fuck. What a pain
in the ass.

01:14:03.264 --> 01:14:06.267
I mean, she belittled me
any time she could

01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:08.748
about my football career
being over.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:11.925
How I wouldn't amount to
anything, how I was a loser.

01:14:11.969 --> 01:14:16.190
We get into it one night, she
had a little too much to drink,

01:14:16.234 --> 01:14:19.933
and she just went too far,
so I fucking punched her.

01:14:19.977 --> 01:14:22.283
Man, it felt good.

01:14:22.327 --> 01:14:26.374
It felt... right.

01:14:26.418 --> 01:14:29.290
So I kept punching her.
And punching her.

01:14:29.334 --> 01:14:35.296
Next thing you know, I don't hear
that irritating little voice of hers.

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:41.302
And when I looked down into that
bloodied, battered face of hers,

01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:42.652
you know what I felt?

01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:45.176
Peace.

01:14:48.353 --> 01:14:50.355
Jon, there's
no such thing as a hero.

01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:56.753
In life,

01:14:56.796 --> 01:14:58.972
you have to fight back.

01:14:59.016 --> 01:15:01.845
What're you doing, Jonny?

01:15:01.888 --> 01:15:03.803
What the fuck, Jon?
What're you doing?

01:15:05.022 --> 01:15:07.503
What the fuck's this?

01:15:07.546 --> 01:15:10.767
For fuck's sake, the karate kid!

01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:11.985
Go ahead, let me see you.

01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:14.205
What do you got?
Yeah.

01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:22.996
Hey!

01:15:25.303 --> 01:15:27.827
This is great.

01:15:27.871 --> 01:15:29.742
Ooh!

01:15:38.838 --> 01:15:40.318
What the fuck was that?

01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:42.059
Jesus Christ!

01:15:47.107 --> 01:15:48.456
What the hell?

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.245
Yeah?

01:15:54.288 --> 01:15:57.770
Yeah, it's Rick Stanton.

01:15:57.814 --> 01:16:00.425
Yeah, listen, I might be
a little late for that flight.

01:16:00.468 --> 01:16:03.733
I got kinda... hung up
here for a minute.

01:16:03.776 --> 01:16:04.777
What's that?

01:16:06.518 --> 01:16:07.780
Fuck!

01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:12.089
I'll do the steak fajitas.
Thanks.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:14.569
Fuck!

01:16:43.424 --> 01:16:44.512
Fuck!

01:17:54.582 --> 01:17:56.889
You can't run from death, Jon.

01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:58.108
Nobody can.

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:04.201
Although I just might
be the exception.

01:20:53.544 --> 01:20:55.720
Jon...

01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:05.730
Thank God you're okay.

01:21:05.773 --> 01:21:08.689
I can explain everything.
It was all Rick's idea.

01:21:08.733 --> 01:21:10.735
He's a pig and you saw that.

01:21:10.778 --> 01:21:14.652
What else was I supposed to do?
I was terrified.

01:21:14.695 --> 01:21:17.829
I thought we were real.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:21.180
Jon, I love you.

01:21:21.224 --> 01:21:24.096
It was me you were laughing
with, watching movies with.

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.707
We were happy!
Don't you remember that?

01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:31.277
Don't you want to be happy?

01:21:31.321 --> 01:21:33.366
We can still go to Colorado.

01:21:39.329 --> 01:21:43.072
Jon...

01:21:43.115 --> 01:21:45.378
Where's the safe?

01:21:59.349 --> 01:22:01.829
Sorry to interrupt you, Jon.

01:22:01.873 --> 01:22:05.790
She take you for ride.
She is biggest scammer ever.

01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:07.792
Her name is Rachel Brisby,

01:22:07.835 --> 01:22:13.667
and she run dating scam website "Hot
and Horny"... escort, crazy shit, man.

01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:15.539
You gotta be kidding me.

01:22:15.582 --> 01:22:17.280
Jon, he's lying.

01:22:17.323 --> 01:22:19.673
He's so jealous of us,
he always has been!

01:22:19.717 --> 01:22:21.588
That's why he started
ripping you off.

01:22:21.632 --> 01:22:23.373
Jon, please listen.

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:25.375
This time, for once.
Come on, listen!

01:22:25.418 --> 01:22:26.942
You believe this crap?

01:22:26.985 --> 01:22:29.640
Anything's possible! You
could Photoshop that shit!

01:22:29.683 --> 01:22:31.947
She's wanted in three states.

01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:33.818
He's the reason
we're in this mess!

01:22:33.861 --> 01:22:35.341
Don't you remember?

01:22:35.385 --> 01:22:37.474
He's the one
who tried to kill you.

01:22:37.517 --> 01:22:39.258
Your decision, Jon.

01:22:39.302 --> 01:22:41.304
I warn you again.

01:22:41.347 --> 01:22:45.134
Babe, I'm sorry.

01:22:45.177 --> 01:22:47.875
Come on, we... we can
still make it to Colorado.

01:22:47.919 --> 01:22:52.228
Somehow you made it
back to me. It is fate.

01:23:00.236 --> 01:23:01.236
Come on.

01:23:11.464 --> 01:23:15.164
Jon. What're you doing, Jon?

01:23:15.207 --> 01:23:17.514
Jon! Turn around!

01:23:17.557 --> 01:23:19.211
Look at me!

01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:20.647
Are you serious?!

01:23:22.345 --> 01:23:24.825
After everything
we've been through?!

01:23:24.869 --> 01:23:27.480
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here?

01:23:28.742 --> 01:23:30.179
Jon!

01:23:30.222 --> 01:23:34.400
Dammit, Jon! I hate you!
I fucking hate you!

01:24:33.764 --> 01:24:37.420
I recreate myself because
I cannot deal with pain.

01:24:39.335 --> 01:24:41.685
So I became Harvey.

01:24:41.728 --> 01:24:45.906
And Harvey's a man
of many faces.

01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:48.561
He's a seeker of happiness
and goodwill.

01:24:56.787 --> 01:25:00.921
Then I meet you, Jon.
All these decades later.

01:25:00.965 --> 01:25:02.575
And I see lost soul.

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.419
And I hope to save you.

01:25:20.463 --> 01:25:23.379
Give you second chance
in your life.

01:25:23.422 --> 01:25:26.425
But you didn't trust me, Jon.

01:25:26.469 --> 01:25:29.036
Be careful what you wish for.

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.484
In life, you take
what you deserve.

01:25:42.833 --> 01:25:47.968
Yeah.

01:25:48.012 --> 01:25:49.970
You have to learn!

01:25:50.014 --> 01:25:51.537
You cannot hide from life,

01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:53.974
you have to listen, the music!

01:27:15.055 --> 01:27:19.190
Well, that's the story.
You survive, Jon.

01:27:21.279 --> 01:27:25.805
Now it's time to face
the truth, your truth.

01:27:46.609 --> 01:27:48.175
You are different.

01:27:48.219 --> 01:27:51.266
Different is
what pushes life forward.

01:27:51.309 --> 01:27:54.791
Different deserves special gift.

01:27:54.834 --> 01:27:58.708
So I ask you...
what is your dream?

01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:00.927
What would make you happy?

01:28:00.971 --> 01:28:03.060
And what did you say,
you remember?

01:28:03.103 --> 01:28:04.931
What did you answer?

01:28:04.975 --> 01:28:07.456
Well, if you don't
remember, I do.

01:28:07.499 --> 01:28:12.765
You say your mom pass away.
You grow up in broken home.

01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:16.203
And all your life, you
searching for your own corner,

01:28:16.247 --> 01:28:19.163
your own place
to call home. Remember?

01:28:41.881 --> 01:28:44.928
Here, read it.

01:28:44.971 --> 01:28:48.627
All we need is
your signature right here

01:28:48.671 --> 01:28:51.674
and your dream come true.

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:25.229
You know what,
he's my best friend

01:29:25.272 --> 01:29:27.971
and I cannot wait
to give him this gift.

01:29:28.014 --> 01:29:30.190
Yeah. Well, he work very hard.
That's his money too.

01:29:44.204 --> 01:29:46.163
I want to surprise him,
that's the bottom line.

01:29:46.206 --> 01:29:47.773
So he will sign later on.

01:29:47.817 --> 01:29:49.993
I make my wish right now.

01:30:00.264 --> 01:30:03.049
Hey, you like it?
It's beautiful?

01:30:03.093 --> 01:30:05.617
Look at the windows.

01:30:05.661 --> 01:30:06.661
Wow.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:11.841
- Congratulations!
- Here you go again!

01:30:11.884 --> 01:30:13.930
- Hey, how you doing?
- Nice to see you.

01:30:13.973 --> 01:30:16.106
- Hey, nice to see you again.
- Nice to meet you.

01:30:17.673 --> 01:30:20.763
- I believe this belongs to you.
- Yeah, it's yours.

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:24.897
The entire house is yours.

01:30:24.941 --> 01:30:27.204
That it is. That it is.

01:30:27.247 --> 01:30:28.988
Okay. Go inside?

01:30:32.775 --> 01:30:33.732
Nice, isn't it?

01:30:33.776 --> 01:30:35.647
- Great.
- Wow.

01:30:36.779 --> 01:30:38.084
After all, your dream come true.

01:30:38.128 --> 01:30:41.000
I can't believe it.

01:30:41.044 --> 01:30:44.047
Let's go inside.

01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:45.701
Man.

01:30:54.057 --> 01:30:56.886
Did it again, Malmo.
Did it again.

01:30:56.929 --> 01:30:59.236
Hey, I hope you enjoy it.

01:30:59.279 --> 01:31:01.325
- It's your house!
- Hey, I gotta tell you...

01:31:01.368 --> 01:31:02.718
Yeah?

01:31:02.761 --> 01:31:04.478
I don't know how I'm ever
gonna repay you for this.

01:31:04.502 --> 01:31:06.939
It's okay, but I
forgot to tell you.

01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:08.985
Guess what?
I sign you up for school,

01:31:09.028 --> 01:31:11.727
and next month we are attending
junior college together.

01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:14.207
Your mom would be
so proud of you.

01:31:14.251 --> 01:31:21.171
- Let's go in?
- Yeah, okay, let's go in.

01:31:21.214 --> 01:31:24.479
So you never told me.
How old are you?
