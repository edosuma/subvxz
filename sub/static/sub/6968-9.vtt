WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:09.927
- They were to check in at midnight.
- You try every band?

00:10.052 --> 00:14.223
- All audiovisual seemed to be down.
- Maybe it's just a satellite glitch.

00:14.348 --> 00:19.394
We thought so too, until we received this...
from a tracking station in Bend, Oregon.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.189
They picked it up
on an emergency frequency.

00:25.609 --> 00:28.237
What are those guys doing?

00:30.656 --> 00:33.951
We did manage to uplink
Firewalker's video camera.

00:33.992 --> 00:38.205
It's at base camp, so we hope it can
give us a picture, tell us what's going on.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.958
Data feed's coming in now.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.676
- What's the robot doing in the volcano?
- I don't know.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.845
There's no descent scheduled.

00:52.928 --> 00:56.682
Firewalker's not responding.
I can't get control.

00:56.723 --> 01:00.853
- Someone's overriding it.
- Lock camera remote and pan left.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.568
Stop. Stop!

01:07.818 --> 01:09.862
Go back.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.241
Tilt up and zoom in.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.539
Erikson.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.292
What the hell...? Give me that!

01:28.422 --> 01:32.718
There it is again. Did you see that?
You saw that shadow, didn't you?

01:32.759 --> 01:36.305
Yeah, but what could be moving around
in that kind of heat?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.015
I don't know.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.855
Maybe it was, uh, just a ghost signal.
I mean, it wouldn't be the first time that...

Episode 09 - Firewalker

02:53.757 --> 02:59.513
Let's go to our science editor Eric
Parker in Mount Avalon, Washington. Eric?

02:59.596 --> 03:02.474
I'm standing here
with a group of scientists...

03:02.558 --> 03:07.187
...who are excited about this device,
which looks like a large titanium bug.

03:07.271 --> 03:11.817
Firewalker will next week make
its first descent into an active volcano.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.362
This robot is the brainchild
of volcanologist Daniel Trepkos.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.739
It will gather samples
from the crater...

03:17.823 --> 03:21.159
...which may hold scientific data
about the Earth's core.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.704
Scientific data?

03:23.787 --> 03:27.249
We're talking about revisiting
the very origin of the Earth.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.960
Peering into the fire where it all began.

03:30.878 --> 03:35.799
A human endeavour more important even
than man's exploration of space.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.554
That's no mean claim.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.473
Daniel always had a flair
for self-dramatisation.

03:43.640 --> 03:48.312
- I'd always heard that he was brilliant.
- Brilliant doesn't go quite far enough.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.023
He occupies a rare place
among scientists...

03:51.106 --> 03:55.277
...where dreams, ambition and...
great luck converge.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.112
You think his luck just ran out.

03:57.196 --> 04:03.118
The team sent a distress signal yesterday
after failing to make a status report.

04:03.202 --> 04:05.913
They haven't responded to any of our calls.

04:05.996 --> 04:10.626
But by using remote telemetry,
we were able to activate Firewalker's camera.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.836
This is what we found.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.881
You're looking at the floor of the volcano.

04:16.548 --> 04:20.177
But this is the last thing
we expected to discover.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.515
The dead man is, uh, Phil Erikson...
chief seismologist.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.435
Now, look at this.

04:29.603 --> 04:33.148
Whoa! What the hell is that?

04:34.316 --> 04:36.568
We don't know.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.029
Whatever it was disabled the camera.

04:39.112 --> 04:43.492
The temperature readings
are upwards of 130ยบ at this depth.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.994
- But that was alive.
- Why weren't you there?

04:46.078 --> 04:50.749
I left the project six weeks ago.
Trepkos and I nearly came to blows.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.170
- Over what?
- Well, I wish I could explain.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.631
Daniel and I, uh...

04:59.049 --> 05:04.805
I always played Salieri to his Mozart.
I was never quite on his plane of intellect.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.099
But this time I found him slipping.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.560
Into madness.

05:10.352 --> 05:14.147
- He controlled the others...
- You think he's responsible for this?

05:14.231 --> 05:17.401
Whatever there is between me and him,
I pray that he isn't.

05:17.484 --> 05:22.447
We've got 20 million tax dollars
in this project. If word of it were to get out...

05:22.531 --> 05:26.618
...it could destroy years of work.
I'm afraid to go through proper channels.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.830
Yeah. We're not exactly proper channels.

05:31.290 --> 05:35.460
- How soon can we get up there?
- There's a flight waiting to take us to Seattle.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.047
From there, a helicopter
will fly us to Mount Avalon.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.551
Scully?

05:42.634 --> 05:47.431
- I don't think it's a good idea for you to go.
- Mulder, I appreciate your concern...

05:47.514 --> 05:50.809
...but I'm ready - I wanna work.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.313
Well, maybe you should take some time off.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.566
I've already lost too much time.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.625
There it is!

07:21.400 --> 07:24.236
This was Firewalker's satellite relay.

07:25.070 --> 07:29.283
We installed field instruments here.
Seismographs, tiltmeters...

07:29.366 --> 07:31.827
We'll look here after we've checked inside.

07:31.910 --> 07:37.291
The instruments are worth millions of project
dollars. I'm accountable to the USGS for 'em.

07:37.374 --> 07:42.087
- Shouldn't we find the descent team first?
- I just wanna take a quick damage survey.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.673
I'll catch up with you in a few minutes.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.652
Hello?

08:38.852 --> 08:43.690
Looks like somebody wanted to put this
operation permanently out of commission.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.361
Mulder!

10:11.445 --> 10:14.531
- Wait! Wait!
- What's going on?

10:14.615 --> 10:18.285
- This isn't what it looks like!
- He just about took my head off.

10:19.036 --> 10:22.414
I told you, I made a mistake, OK?
I'm sorry, all right?

10:22.497 --> 10:26.293
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm... I'm Ludwig. I'm Jason Ludwig.

10:26.376 --> 10:30.172
- I'm the robotics engineer.
- Do you always greet people this way?

10:30.255 --> 10:33.717
I heard a noise. I thought it was him.
I was protecting myself.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.594
You know, self-preservation?

10:35.677 --> 10:39.848
Who did you think I was that you thought
you had to protect yourself?

10:39.932 --> 10:42.017
Trepkos.

10:48.732 --> 10:55.113
Sometimes he wouldn't talk to us for days.
Then, boom! You couldn't get him to shut up.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.282
Don't get me wrong, OK?

10:57.366 --> 11:00.160
No one revered the man more than me.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.205
I mean... he was a prophet...

11:04.206 --> 11:05.832
...an oracle.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.626
He saw things.

11:07.709 --> 11:11.338
I-I... I mean, he...
he saw things that you and me...

11:12.339 --> 11:14.550
...we only dream about...

11:14.633 --> 11:17.761
...and then forget when we wake up.

11:25.769 --> 11:30.148
Well, it's OK, you can come out now.
The cavalry's here.

11:34.862 --> 11:38.156
This is Peter Tanaka, our systems analyst.

11:43.412 --> 11:46.790
And, uh, this is Jesse O'Neil.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.627
Are you the rescue team?

11:50.711 --> 11:53.547
- No, we're with the FBI.
- FBI?

11:54.464 --> 11:56.550
But you're taking us back, right?

11:56.842 --> 12:00.721
- After we've investigated what happened.
- Trepkos is what happened.

12:00.846 --> 12:04.141
- Did he kill Erikson?
- He flipped out.

12:05.309 --> 12:08.604
Right after the descent, he just flipped out.

12:08.687 --> 12:13.108
Can you think of anything that might've
caused or contributed to his behaviour?

12:13.192 --> 12:16.695
- You're asking me?
- Daniel was sick.

12:17.487 --> 12:22.117
He had a bipolar disorder.
I think that's what it was.

12:22.201 --> 12:26.622
It wasn't a secret, but it's not
something he advertised either.

12:26.705 --> 12:29.416
But with his medication he was just fine.

12:30.334 --> 12:33.962
Well, I think Erikson's wife
might disagree with that.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.717
You're part of the team, Jesse?

12:39.760 --> 12:44.389
Daniel was my thesis advisor
at the university.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.643
He asked me to assist him on this project.

12:49.561 --> 12:53.106
- Are these his notes?
- Oh... yeah.

12:53.899 --> 12:56.276
Well, whatever's left of 'em.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.322
First thing he did was
destroy all his own work.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.784
You know, his field journals,
his computer disks.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.621
We salvaged what we could, but...

13:07.704 --> 13:10.749
...I don't really think
you'll find much in there.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.168
Of use, anyway.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.531
Hello?

13:43.782 --> 13:46.285
Anyone there?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.842
Scully.

14:07.723 --> 14:10.726
What d'you make
of Mr Trepkos's neighbourhood?

14:10.809 --> 14:15.189
- What d'you mean?
- Isn't their behaviour bizarre? Paranoid?

14:15.272 --> 14:19.902
- After what they've been through, no.
- They're practically climbing the walls.

14:19.985 --> 14:22.946
They've been living in
the middle of nowhere for a year.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.741
One is dead, probably
at the hands of another.

14:25.824 --> 14:29.369
You have to expect some heightened level
of emotional distress.

14:29.453 --> 14:32.873
It's more than that. There's
something they're not telling us.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.250
Based on what?

14:35.334 --> 14:38.795
Based on when Ludwig
tried to play T-ball with my head.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.340
He knew I wasn't Trepkos.

14:42.216 --> 14:46.762
- Now Mulder, you're sounding paranoid.
- Pierce knows these people.

14:46.845 --> 14:49.848
Let's find out what he thinks.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.850
OK.

15:17.459 --> 15:20.337
No one... can leave.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.268
Pierce!

15:34.351 --> 15:36.937
- He's not here.
- Pierce!

15:37.020 --> 15:40.649
- Something's happened!
- Oh, my God!

15:40.732 --> 15:45.571
Get over here. He's over here!
I've found him! I've found him!

15:46.405 --> 15:48.490
I've found him!

15:53.704 --> 15:56.748
- That should do it.
- What shall we do with the body?

15:56.832 --> 15:58.542
- Do you have a freezer?
- Yeah.

15:58.625 --> 16:02.296
- Radio for the helicopter. I'm almost done.
- Let me help you.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.798
No, that's OK, we got him.

16:10.721 --> 16:13.182
- We can't leave, Scully. Not yet.
- Why not?

16:13.265 --> 16:16.768
- Trepkos is still out there.
- He killed Pierce and probably Erikson.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.813
- We should come back with a larger party.
- No.

16:20.480 --> 16:25.819
I've been going over Trepkos's work. I found
references to a subterranean organism.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.655
- What?
- An organism existing within the volcano.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.991
No specific description...

16:31.074 --> 16:33.869
Mulder, nothing can live
in a volcanic interior.

16:33.952 --> 16:37.748
Not only because of the intense heat,
but the gasses would be toxic.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.209
What does this say?

16:41.126 --> 16:46.048
It describes the metabolism from
hydrogen sulphide into silicon dioxide.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.050
A silicon-based life form?

16:48.133 --> 16:51.803
The basic building block for every
organism known to man is carbon.

16:51.887 --> 16:56.558
- From bacterium to redwood trees.
- Silicon is the closest element to carbon.

16:56.642 --> 17:01.063
It reacts identically with other elements -
it combines to form complex molecules.

17:01.146 --> 17:04.816
A silicon-based life form is one of
the holy grails of modern science.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.234
Maybe Trepkos found it.

17:06.318 --> 17:11.615
Mulder, that is science fiction. It's... an
elaborate construct from a delusional mind.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.909
This doesn't prove anything.

17:13.992 --> 17:17.663
Trepkos said he had evidence.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

17:17.746 --> 17:23.544
- Whatever evidence he had, he destroyed.
- Maybe it wasn't Trepkos who destroyed it.

17:23.627 --> 17:27.381
- What if it was one of the others?
- Why would they do that?

17:28.131 --> 17:32.678
All of these people are suffering to
varying degrees from post-traumatic stress.

17:32.761 --> 17:38.517
And from a medical point of view, we have to
get them out of here sooner rather than later.

17:50.362 --> 17:52.447
Jesse?

17:53.699 --> 17:55.784
Can I talk to you?

18:01.915 --> 18:04.001
Are you OK?

18:06.211 --> 18:08.922
I hate this place.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.176
What happened here, Jesse?

18:14.428 --> 18:16.847
You can trust me.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.435
After the first descent...

18:21.518 --> 18:23.604
...Daniel changed.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.981
He became withdrawn and paranoid.

18:26.064 --> 18:30.277
He locked himself in the lab
for three days and wouldn't let any of us in.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.155
Do you think the descent
triggered his breakdown?

18:33.238 --> 18:35.449
Well, that's what I thought.

18:35.532 --> 18:38.327
And then... I found out...

18:39.828 --> 18:42.623
...that he's not taking his pills.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.710
Lithium carbonate.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.922
Yeah, he said that
they were polluting his brain.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.966
And... he said I was polluting his body.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.765
I'm scared.

18:59.848 --> 19:03.560
- I don't wanna die here.
- What are you so afraid of, Jesse?

19:03.769 --> 19:05.854
Daniel.

19:08.774 --> 19:12.653
The only reason I even came here
was because of him.

19:14.446 --> 19:18.200
He promised me
that this would be an adventure.

19:20.494 --> 19:22.955
That it would change my life.

19:27.584 --> 19:33.006
But eight months is a long time,
and I just wanna go home now.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.175
Where's home?

19:35.843 --> 19:38.178
Anywhere but here.

19:42.891 --> 19:48.689
Samples 7, 12 and 22 also
contain trace evidence of the organism.

19:48.772 --> 19:53.986
The possibility of this new,
or perhaps unfathomably old, life form...

19:54.069 --> 19:59.491
...has left me sleepless, wondering
if I haven't lost all perspective.

20:00.409 --> 20:06.623
If my intense desire to find the truth
hasn't finally eclipsed the truth itself.

20:06.707 --> 20:11.962
Our meddling intellect misshapes
the beauteous forms of things.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.131
We murder to dissect.

20:15.549 --> 20:19.553
My mind is a tangled knot
I can no longer untie.

20:19.720 --> 20:24.391
Daily, I fight the urge to sever it completely
to stop this descent.

20:43.911 --> 20:46.205
What caused that tremor?

20:46.997 --> 20:50.667
There's been a lot of seismic activity
in the northeast rift zone.

20:50.751 --> 20:55.672
If Trepkos hadn't destroyed our instruments,
we might have learned something from it.

20:55.756 --> 20:58.258
You feeling all right?

21:01.553 --> 21:02.763
Yeah.

21:02.846 --> 21:06.141
Agent Scully's a medical doctor.
Let her take a look at you.

21:06.225 --> 21:08.435
- I'm fine.
- Just let her take a look...

21:08.519 --> 21:09.937
No!

21:13.732 --> 21:16.652
I'll go get Scully.

21:19.988 --> 21:23.492
- Come on, get up. She'll help you.
- I don't want her to!

21:23.575 --> 21:26.453
Of course you do! It's for the best.

21:26.954 --> 21:29.206
We have to get out of here.

21:29.957 --> 21:34.253
He just collapsed after the tremor.
He seems pretty bad.

21:36.630 --> 21:39.299
- He's burning up.
- What is it?

21:39.383 --> 21:43.262
An infection or a toxic reaction.
We've gotta get him to a hospital.

21:43.345 --> 21:46.807
- I'll get a stretcher.
- We can't just leave Trepkos.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.309
Give me the shortwave.

21:52.604 --> 21:57.818
This is Agent Scully with the Firewalker
team. Come in, Search and Rescue.

21:59.069 --> 22:02.114
I'll get O'Neil
and meet you at the landing site.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.866
This is Search and Rescue.

22:03.949 --> 22:07.035
Request dispatch of medevac immediately.

22:07.119 --> 22:11.123
We have an Asian male, mid-thirties,
spiking a high-grade fever.

22:32.853 --> 22:35.647
Tanaka's collapsed. We're getting him out.

22:50.871 --> 22:53.332
- Tanaka!
- Peter!

22:53.415 --> 22:56.001
Peter, come on, get back here!

23:32.079 --> 23:33.956
There.

23:38.836 --> 23:41.004
- Come on.
- Don't go down there!

23:41.088 --> 23:44.842
- Let me go! What're you doing? Let go of me!
- Don't go down there.

23:44.925 --> 23:47.511
For God's sakes, he needs our help!

24:17.833 --> 24:20.919
So what is it, Scully?
What are we dealing with?

24:21.003 --> 24:24.256
Without better imaging equipment,
I can't say for sure.

24:24.339 --> 24:26.842
I'll take any theory you've got.

24:26.925 --> 24:31.471
- It appears to be some kind of a fungus.
- Anything you recognise?

24:31.555 --> 24:36.727
Well, I'm not a botanist, but I think it's
fair to guess that it's an unknown genus.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.688
- What am I looking at here?
- Spores.

24:39.771 --> 24:42.691
I scraped them off the tip of the fungus.

24:43.692 --> 24:49.615
It appears as if one of the spores grew inside
Tanaka until it reached reproductive maturity.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.783
Essentially outgrowing its host.

24:51.867 --> 24:57.122
But by then it had caused massive tissue
damage, particularly to the respiratory tract.

24:57.206 --> 25:01.001
- That accounts for the sand in his lungs.
- You found sand in his lungs?

25:01.084 --> 25:05.297
Silicon dioxide. The waste product
of a silicon-based organism.

25:05.464 --> 25:10.969
Wait a second. There... there's no such thing
as a silicon-based organism.

25:11.053 --> 25:13.430
Maybe now there is.

25:13.722 --> 25:17.935
But we won't have proof until
we determine its molecular structure.

25:18.018 --> 25:20.938
Come on. How else do you explain
the sand in his lungs?

25:21.021 --> 25:25.317
It's the best trace evidence
we could ask for. Trepkos was right.

25:25.859 --> 25:28.320
Daniel knew about this?

25:28.403 --> 25:31.990
He discovered a spore
in the samples Firewalker brought up.

25:32.074 --> 25:33.492
He would've told us.

25:33.659 --> 25:38.247
Not if what he discovered was
too disturbing even for him to understand.

25:38.330 --> 25:43.126
This might explain something else.
The spore could explain Trepkos's dementia.

25:43.210 --> 25:46.213
Fungi contain alkaloids
that affect the nervous system.

25:46.296 --> 25:50.092
Yeah, but what about us?
I mean... we weren't exposed.

25:50.175 --> 25:54.888
We don't know that. If it was an airborne
microbe, any of us could've inhaled a spore.

25:55.138 --> 25:57.307
So we're not going home, right?

25:57.391 --> 26:00.727
Not until we know how it's transmitted,
how it incubates.

26:00.811 --> 26:05.983
If even one of us is infected, we could risk
infecting a much larger population.

26:13.574 --> 26:16.451
Search and Rescue, this is
Agent Mulder. Do you copy?

26:16.535 --> 26:19.705
This is Search and Rescue.
We're in a holding pattern. Over.

26:19.788 --> 26:25.794
Notify FBI District HQ in Spokane that we're
in quarantine due to possible contagion.

26:25.878 --> 26:29.173
Have CDC send up an evacuation unit
on high alert.

26:29.256 --> 26:31.758
What's the nature of the contagion?

26:33.886 --> 26:36.138
Agent Mulder?

26:36.221 --> 26:40.976
Tell them it's a biological agent...
of unknown origin.

26:41.059 --> 26:43.353
That's affirmative. Standing by.

26:45.355 --> 26:48.108
Maybe you should go check up on O'Neil.

27:07.294 --> 27:09.796
I'm gonna go find Trepkos.

27:12.799 --> 27:17.763
- What if he's already dead?
- He'll find it tough answering my questions.

27:17.846 --> 27:20.224
I've gotta find out what he knows.

27:20.307 --> 27:24.102
It could change our understanding
of the origin and evolution of life.

27:24.186 --> 27:27.648
He's dangerous, Mulder.
He's already killed two men.

27:27.731 --> 27:31.568
- Then I have to find out why.
- Will you at least let me go with you?

27:31.652 --> 27:32.945
No.

27:33.028 --> 27:37.491
Look, I know what you're thinking,
but you have to get past that. We both do.

27:37.574 --> 27:40.994
I'm back... and I'm not going anywhere.

27:41.954 --> 27:45.123
You have to finish the autopsy on Tanaka.

27:45.207 --> 27:50.587
Hopefully that'll give us a better idea
of what we're dealing with-whatever it is.

27:50.671 --> 27:54.800
I'm counting on you to keep us all
from ending up on that slab.

28:17.072 --> 28:20.200
- Do like we said, OK?
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

28:20.284 --> 28:22.411
You know what to say, right?

28:24.663 --> 28:26.957
I could use a little help.

28:27.708 --> 28:29.793
Excuse me.

28:31.712 --> 28:36.091
- So what do you need?
- Directions, a contour map, USGS survey.

28:36.175 --> 28:38.677
Anything that can help me get here.

28:39.887 --> 28:41.972
Oh.

28:43.974 --> 28:46.643
These are the steam caves.

28:47.853 --> 28:51.690
They feed into the Sherman Crater.
That's how we access the caldera.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.401
- How did you get these?
- Firewalker.

28:54.484 --> 28:59.489
They were transmitted right before
Trepkos destroyed his camera.

28:59.573 --> 29:01.116
Oh!

29:01.200 --> 29:04.036
So you're finally gonna go after Trepkos?

29:06.788 --> 29:09.208
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

29:09.291 --> 29:12.252
You won't find him with those.

29:12.336 --> 29:16.548
- And you won't find him with any map either.
- How will I find him?

29:16.632 --> 29:18.717
You won't.

29:20.677 --> 29:23.680
- Not without a guide.
- A guide?

29:23.764 --> 29:26.934
Yeah, a guide.
I've been up here for almost a year.

29:27.017 --> 29:29.436
I spent months in those caves...

29:29.520 --> 29:33.941
...charting every fissure, every crevice,
so Firewalker wouldn't trip.

29:34.024 --> 29:37.027
If Trepkos is there, I can find him.

29:37.110 --> 29:40.822
- Why are you so eager to help me find him?
- Oh, I'm... I'm not eager.

29:40.948 --> 29:47.204
I just don't want to wait around for Trepkos to
do to me what he did to Pierce and Erikson.

29:47.287 --> 29:49.623
Plus, you've got the gun.

29:51.375 --> 29:54.920
You're the only one
who can get us out of this place.

30:14.439 --> 30:16.942
Whatever I'm smelling, is it toxic?

30:17.025 --> 30:22.447
Between the heat and the sulphur, it can get
pretty nasty in here. But it won't hurt you.

30:22.531 --> 30:24.908
You'll get used to it.

30:25.951 --> 30:31.957
- How far does the cave extend?
- Three quarters of a mile, to the crater rim.

30:33.417 --> 30:35.878
Let's head in.

30:36.920 --> 30:41.508
It twists around quite a bit
till you get there. Lots of dead ends...

30:42.885 --> 30:45.012
...and blind drops.

30:45.095 --> 30:49.892
Unless you know where you're going,
you're... like a rat in a maze.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.361
Argh! Argh!

31:01.695 --> 31:03.780
Argh!

31:32.684 --> 31:34.770
Your gun.

31:38.565 --> 31:40.776
Back. Get back.

31:47.783 --> 31:50.953
Why are you doing this, Trepkos?
He's already dead.

31:51.036 --> 31:54.331
How many times do you have to kill him?

32:00.420 --> 32:03.090
It's not him I'm trying to kill.

32:38.125 --> 32:43.088
I have attempted to culture the spore, using
temperatures ranging from human basal...

32:43.172 --> 32:46.592
...to those approximating
the volcanic interior.

32:46.675 --> 32:50.137
I have used nutritive mediums containing...

32:50.888 --> 32:55.058
...human tissue, blood and saliva.
Even sulphur.

32:55.142 --> 32:57.644
However, none of the seven trials...

32:57.728 --> 33:01.940
...have successfully grown
the fungus that killed Tanaka.

33:02.024 --> 33:07.404
Based on this preliminary data,
I have come to the following hypothesis:

33:08.989 --> 33:13.327
...That unless the spores are ingested
or inhaled by the host organism...

33:13.410 --> 33:16.330
...immediately upon their release...

33:16.413 --> 33:18.707
...they become harmless...

33:18.790 --> 33:21.001
...effectively dead.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.885
Jesse?

33:35.182 --> 33:37.476
What is it?

33:37.559 --> 33:41.939
I thought you'd like to know-the chances
are good that none of us were infected.

33:43.899 --> 33:49.613
We were a safe distance from Tanaka. When
Mulder and Ludwig come back, we can leave.

33:49.696 --> 33:53.951
I... I just need to run a few more tests,
but I think we're gonna be OK.

33:57.329 --> 33:59.414
Ow. Oooh.

34:00.999 --> 34:03.377
OK, Jesse? Jesse?

34:08.130 --> 34:10.634
What went wrong, Trepkos?

34:13.387 --> 34:17.014
Firewalker carried something back
to the surface.

34:18.266 --> 34:20.978
Firewalker brought up an elephant.

34:22.938 --> 34:25.107
The truth...

34:25.190 --> 34:28.735
...is an elephant described by three blind men.

34:30.362 --> 34:33.991
The first man touches the tail
and says it's a rope.

34:34.908 --> 34:39.288
The second man feels the rough leg
and says it's a tree.

34:41.164 --> 34:44.168
The third man feels the trunk
and says it's a snake.

34:44.376 --> 34:47.504
What about you? What do you say it is?

34:49.422 --> 34:53.635
I say the earth holds some truths
best left buried.

34:54.094 --> 34:56.513
Like the spore?

35:00.392 --> 35:04.855
- Who are you?
- I'm Special Agent Mulder. I'm with the FBI.

35:05.772 --> 35:07.649
You don't look like a policeman.

35:07.733 --> 35:10.819
I came down here to investigate
Erikson's death.

35:10.903 --> 35:13.405
That's not why you're here.

35:14.948 --> 35:20.495
You still believe you can petition heaven
and get some penetrating answer.

35:21.872 --> 35:24.374
If you found that answer...

35:26.877 --> 35:29.171
...what would you do with it?

35:33.091 --> 35:36.970
I just wanna know what happened
after the first descent.

35:39.014 --> 35:41.308
What did you find?

35:46.146 --> 35:48.440
It was porous...

35:51.568 --> 35:53.654
...obsidian.

35:54.530 --> 35:59.868
Erikson thought it was some sort of rock,
so I told him to pulverise it for analysis.

35:59.952 --> 36:03.622
- Erikson released the spore?
- He discovered a new life form.

36:03.705 --> 36:08.210
In a single moment, all that science
held sacred suddenly turned on its head.

36:08.293 --> 36:14.341
- What about Erikson? lf... if he was infected...
- I was too immersed in the work to notice.

36:15.342 --> 36:20.472
I'd been alone in the lab for three days...
when I heard their screams.

36:23.934 --> 36:26.436
They were all gathered around him.

36:27.354 --> 36:32.359
By the time I realised what was happening,
they were already changing.

36:32.442 --> 36:36.989
The spore... grew in each of them
until it became...

36:37.072 --> 36:39.491
What do you mean?

36:40.534 --> 36:42.911
It's a parasite.

36:42.995 --> 36:45.873
It lives to find a host.

36:45.956 --> 36:48.709
- But you weren't infected?
- No.

36:50.043 --> 36:52.588
You destroyed your work, the equipment.

36:52.671 --> 36:55.716
You killed Pierce... so no one could leave.

36:56.341 --> 36:58.594
No one can leave.

37:04.349 --> 37:06.977
What about O'Neil?

37:07.060 --> 37:08.854
Jesse?

37:08.937 --> 37:13.358
- Was she exposed to the spore?
- They were all exposed.

37:15.986 --> 37:19.948
- All of them.
- I have a colleague, a friend...

37:20.616 --> 37:23.327
...who's with O'Neil right now.

37:23.410 --> 37:27.456
- Let me go to her.
- She may already be infected.

37:33.962 --> 37:36.173
I can't let you leave.

37:37.466 --> 37:40.093
Then you're gonna have to shoot me.

37:40.928 --> 37:43.430
Because I'm walking outta here.

38:27.850 --> 38:29.935
Jesse?

38:46.410 --> 38:48.078
Oh!

38:48.829 --> 38:51.582
God, you scared me!

38:51.957 --> 38:55.210
Jesse?

38:55.294 --> 38:58.213
Are you OK?

38:58.297 --> 39:01.300
Jesse, what's wrong? Jesse?

39:03.635 --> 39:06.138
Jesse, what are you doing?

40:45.195 --> 40:46.613
Scully?

40:48.240 --> 40:50.158
Scully?

40:50.242 --> 40:52.327
I'm OK. I'm OK.

40:56.874 --> 40:59.293
- You all right?
- I'm OK.

41:15.642 --> 41:16.894
Yeah.

41:20.105 --> 41:22.441
Mulder, look...

41:23.192 --> 41:26.945
...she was infected. I don't know how.

41:27.029 --> 41:29.406
Erikson was the original host.

41:29.489 --> 41:33.911
When the fungus shed its spores, everyone
was at ground zero, except for Trepkos.

41:33.994 --> 41:36.330
Did you find him?

42:02.564 --> 42:06.610
I told her... it would change her life.

42:19.206 --> 42:22.167
Search and Rescue,
this is Agent Mulder. Do you copy?

42:22.251 --> 42:25.796
This is Army Biohazard.
How many are in your party?

42:33.095 --> 42:36.139
We have two survivors -
Agent Scully and myself.

42:36.223 --> 42:39.768
Copy that. Our ETA is seven minutes.

42:40.894 --> 42:44.690
Mulder, what are you doing?
They're gonna wanna question him.

42:45.899 --> 42:48.277
It's all over, Scully.

42:49.152 --> 42:51.488
He won't talk.

43:05.419 --> 43:08.463
Scully and I are in the third day
of a month's quarantine...

43:08.547 --> 43:11.466
...undergoing level four decon procedures.

43:11.550 --> 43:15.721
We are, so far, without symptoms
of fungal contamination.

43:18.891 --> 43:25.439
Our specimens and field notes were taken by
the biohazard corps prior to our evacuation.

43:25.522 --> 43:31.361
Their presence is delayed indefinitely for
the arrival of the USGS data retrieval team.

43:31.445 --> 43:36.366
I suspect, though, there will be
little left for them to retrieve.

43:36.450 --> 43:42.623
There are no plans to explore the volcanically
active mountains in the Cascade range...

43:42.706 --> 43:45.083
...including Mount Avalon.

43:46.960 --> 43:51.798
All access points to that volcano
have been sealed off by army engineers.

43:53.967 --> 43:57.012
Of the members
of the Firewalker descent team...

43:57.095 --> 44:00.349
...only Trepkos and O'Neil
remain unaccounted for.

44:00.432 --> 44:04.561
They are presumed dead,
and the search for them has been abandoned.

44:05.979 --> 44:08.398
Firewalker, however, was recovered...

44:08.482 --> 44:13.987
...though its sensory and locomotive systems
were found to be irreparably damaged.

44:14.071 --> 44:18.200
The data it collected from the Earth's interior
will never be known.

44:18.283 --> 44:23.914
And of the events that occurred at Mount
Avalon between 11 and 13 November 1994...

44:25.958 --> 44:28.836
...mine stands as the only record.

44:32.096 --> 44:38.307
