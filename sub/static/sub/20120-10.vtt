00:03.770 --> 00:05.190
It's like the report said...

00:06.560 --> 00:08.600
The entire village is devastated,

00:08.980 --> 00:11.740
and yet there's not a drop of blood,
let alone any bodies here.

00:12.320 --> 00:16.910
Then... the villagers of Ragako
were able to safely evacuate?

00:16.910 --> 00:18.390
If that's the case,

00:18.390 --> 00:22.550
then the Titans were having
a field day in a completely empty village.

00:23.210 --> 00:24.760
That's hard to believe.

00:26.380 --> 00:31.210
Furthermore... why would they evacuate
without even taking a single horse?

00:32.380 --> 00:33.550
Then what happened?

00:34.090 --> 00:35.360
What could this mean?

00:36.090 --> 00:38.470
Moblit, I found one! This way!

00:41.720 --> 00:42.730
There you are...

00:48.190 --> 00:50.270
Moblit, look at this.

00:52.990 --> 00:55.820
This is a portrait of 
Conny Springer's parents?

00:55.820 --> 00:57.680
It's a strong possibility.

01:02.910 --> 01:03.610
Kill it!

01:03.870 --> 01:05.410
Wait! Hold up!

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:19.600 --> 01:21.000
Unbelievable...

02:52.020 --> 02:57.030
"Children"

02:58.650 --> 03:02.500
Will it be your petty life...
or Christa's future?

03:03.410 --> 03:04.990
It's up to you to decide.

03:05.910 --> 03:09.370
Hey, say something! Who's the enemy?!

03:09.870 --> 03:10.940
Ymir!

03:13.960 --> 03:15.210
Who knows...

03:16.130 --> 03:16.990
It's settled then.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.200
Too bad, Eren.

03:29.100 --> 03:29.980
You're kidding...

03:30.520 --> 03:32.850
The Scouts... are already...

03:35.270 --> 03:36.520
Dammit!

03:36.770 --> 03:39.140
Reiner. What are you right now?

03:39.530 --> 03:41.340
Relax, I'm a warrior.

03:41.860 --> 03:44.460
You're saying to trust Ymir as a warrior?

03:45.200 --> 03:47.240
Isn't she the one who ate Marcel?

03:47.830 --> 03:51.640
Yeah, that's my point. 
Ymir's motive is clear.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.170
Once she turned human again,

03:54.170 --> 03:57.800
she probably roamed around
and lived only caring about herself.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.480
Until she met Christa...

04:01.800 --> 04:06.780
And as cute as Christa is, we have
other reasons to bring her to our side.

04:07.350 --> 04:10.280
She's an important person
in a family of the Church.

04:11.060 --> 04:15.370
If Eren turns out not to be the Coordinate,
our job isn't over yet.

04:16.360 --> 04:20.720
Having Christa with us at that point
will make our search much easier.

04:26.620 --> 04:27.570
They're close.

04:28.580 --> 04:30.230
What are they talking about?

04:30.790 --> 04:33.580
Are they planning to leave 
before the sun sets?

04:34.460 --> 04:36.340
Let's bring an end to it.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.110
The next time we come here,

04:39.110 --> 04:41.960
we can take Annie, Christa, 
and that back home.

04:42.670 --> 04:45.300
That way we won't have to come here anymore.

04:45.300 --> 04:48.300
Right. And our mission will be over.

04:49.350 --> 04:50.540
But as for you...

04:51.180 --> 04:54.020
When we get to our hometown,
tell Annie how you feel.

04:54.020 --> 04:55.690
Huh? Wh-What do you mean?

04:56.020 --> 04:56.940
You stare too much.

04:57.570 --> 04:59.940
Enough that everyone can tell.

05:00.730 --> 05:01.650
But I--

05:01.650 --> 05:03.130
You should go for it.

05:03.130 --> 05:05.370
You're both murderers with short lives ahead.

05:05.990 --> 05:09.170
Who better to understand what
we've gone through than one of us?

05:15.660 --> 05:17.170
What's going on, Reiner?

05:17.290 --> 05:19.040
Aren't we waiting until night?

05:19.040 --> 05:20.900
Nope. We're leaving now.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.380
Eren, don't try to resist.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.680
Come on, don't get violent with me.

05:33.310 --> 05:37.690
Look at the shape that I'm in.
Does it look like I can resist?

05:38.150 --> 05:39.910
Please, gimme a break.

05:48.660 --> 05:53.160
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

05:58.210 --> 06:00.360
I'll kill you! I'll slaughter you!

06:02.750 --> 06:05.650
--I'll kill you!
--Hey. Why are we leaving already?

06:06.760 --> 06:07.760
--Let go!
--Ymir.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.480
When you turned back into a human,
do you remember the person you ate?

06:15.060 --> 06:17.750
No, I don't remember...

06:19.980 --> 06:22.580
But if it was five years ago...

06:25.030 --> 06:26.640
Was it one of your comrades?

06:33.080 --> 06:33.990
I see...

06:34.540 --> 06:37.350
Sorry... for not even remembering.

06:43.090 --> 06:45.090
It's not your fault for forgetting.

06:46.510 --> 06:48.300
It was the same for us, too.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.970
I see...

06:50.630 --> 06:52.630
Eren doesn't seem to remember either.

06:53.300 --> 06:54.990
Is that how it works?

06:58.140 --> 06:59.790
Do you resent me for it?

07:00.640 --> 07:04.570
I'm not sure... I... don't know.

07:05.690 --> 07:08.280
You probably didn't want
to eat a human either...

07:09.280 --> 07:12.940
How long were you wandering
outside the walls for?

07:13.660 --> 07:15.180
About 60 years.

07:16.270 --> 07:20.010
It was like... I was stuck in
a nightmare that would never  end.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.720
A red smoke signal.

07:37.970 --> 07:38.630
What?

07:43.100 --> 07:45.150
Commander! We're surrounded!

07:45.360 --> 07:47.830
There's a way around!
Should we head towards it?

07:49.860 --> 07:52.820
No... Any detours and we'll be too late.

07:53.570 --> 07:57.240
We'll force our way through!
All soldiers, prepare for battle!

07:59.950 --> 08:02.710
For now, let's get to a place without Titans!

08:03.080 --> 08:05.030
We need to get as far away as possible!

08:06.040 --> 08:08.190
My Titan form isn't very fast.

08:08.550 --> 08:11.970
If I get surrounded,
I won't be able to protect you guys!

08:11.970 --> 08:14.390
Then why didn't we just 
wait until nightfall?!

08:15.930 --> 08:19.180
Smoke signals?
Did the Scouts come to rescue us?

08:19.310 --> 08:21.910
Unless they brought loads 
of horses over the wall,

08:21.910 --> 08:23.190
that scouting formation won't work.

08:23.730 --> 08:24.810
Someone made that call...

08:26.690 --> 08:28.840
I didn't think it would happen so soon.

08:29.270 --> 08:32.549
It must be Commander Erwin.
A tough opponent!

08:34.950 --> 08:37.240
Shit... They're already that close?

08:37.950 --> 08:40.200
It's Eren's fault for going berserk.

08:44.370 --> 08:45.290
It can't be...

08:46.630 --> 08:47.560
She's...

08:50.630 --> 08:51.520
No, she is!

08:52.300 --> 08:56.260
Reiner! Christa's here!
Christa came with them!

08:56.260 --> 08:56.890
Huh?!

08:56.890 --> 08:58.350
If you want her, now's the chance!

08:58.350 --> 09:00.930
How do you know? You can't see her from here!

09:00.930 --> 09:02.060
I just know it!

09:02.390 --> 09:05.260
She's such a good-natured 
person, it's stupid!

09:05.710 --> 09:08.490
I guarantee she came to save me! I know it!

09:08.810 --> 09:11.680
Even if that's true, it's no use!

09:11.940 --> 09:13.190
We'll do it later!

09:13.190 --> 09:14.490
Huh?!

09:14.490 --> 09:16.780
Our chance of succeeding is way too low!

09:17.450 --> 09:19.620
How will you get Christa 
out of that formation?

09:20.080 --> 09:21.210
Wait for a chance!

09:21.950 --> 09:23.700
Wait for a chance?

09:24.080 --> 09:28.380
Seriously? Will that be after
I'm eaten by one of your warriors?

09:28.380 --> 09:30.130
No! I don't trust you!

09:30.250 --> 09:34.510
Trust me! Christa is 
indispensable to us, too!

09:34.510 --> 09:38.220
Then get her now!
Go prove it to me this instant!

09:38.220 --> 09:40.640
It has to be now or never!

09:40.760 --> 09:42.520
I want to see her right now!

09:44.640 --> 09:48.050
At this rate...
I'll never get a chance...

09:48.050 --> 09:49.260
to see her again.

09:51.070 --> 09:56.070
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Ymir's Hometown"

09:51.070 --> 09:56.070
"It is not known where Ymir's hometown is located.
 However, its location is most certainly
 outside the confines of the walls."

09:59.240 --> 10:00.200
It's impossible.

10:02.410 --> 10:04.080
I'm sorry, Ymir.

10:07.160 --> 10:11.550
We don't even know if we can escape 
ourselves, let alone go back for her.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.220
I promise you!

10:13.880 --> 10:16.920
If anyone, it's Christa I want
to save from this conflict!

10:18.050 --> 10:21.290
You have to trust us! So just bear with it!

10:22.640 --> 10:26.180
This is for Christa's 
own sake! Got it, Ymir?!

10:28.270 --> 10:31.870
Is it... really for Christa's sake?

10:32.480 --> 10:33.250
Yeah!

10:34.980 --> 10:35.760
Fine...

10:36.280 --> 10:37.490
Thank you.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.040
It's happening again, Christa...

10:42.120 --> 10:43.320
I've come this far...

10:44.160 --> 10:45.510
...and yet it seems...

10:46.580 --> 10:48.870
Will I have to lie to myself again?

10:50.460 --> 10:52.750
Hey... Here's a promising one.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.350
How's this kid?

11:03.760 --> 11:04.370
Yeah.

11:05.640 --> 11:09.550
Hey, you there. You're going to
come live with us from now on.

11:10.390 --> 11:13.010
You'll be able to live a brand-new life now.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.740
A brand-new life... needs a brand-new name.

11:18.860 --> 11:19.730
Understand?

11:21.700 --> 11:25.220
That day... was the first 
time I lied to myself.

11:26.080 --> 11:30.530
From that point on, I convinced myself...
that I never had a choice.

11:31.620 --> 11:32.250
But...

11:33.710 --> 11:37.790
It is this Lady Ymir who inherits
the blood of the king.

11:38.170 --> 11:42.360
As long as Lady Ymir is with us,
we will be blessed with immortality.

11:44.050 --> 11:45.640
Lady Ymir!

11:48.600 --> 11:52.160
To be honest... it wasn't all that bad.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.620
My food wasn't cold anymore...

11:56.610 --> 11:58.830
And neither was my bed off the ground.

11:59.860 --> 12:00.970
Lady Ymir.

12:01.700 --> 12:05.440
But more than all... was the feeling
of being needed by someone.

12:05.950 --> 12:09.080
I served a purpose in someone's life
for the first time ever.

12:09.700 --> 12:13.010
To me, that was more precious
than anything else.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.000
But then, one day...

12:21.470 --> 12:24.570
It's her! She's the one who did it!

12:24.890 --> 12:29.560
She told us she has the blood of the king!
All we did was believe her!

12:30.560 --> 12:34.030
I was cruelly reminded
that everything in my life...

12:34.650 --> 12:35.830
...was a lie.

12:37.690 --> 12:38.800
Is that right?

12:39.730 --> 12:41.810
N-N--

12:52.660 --> 12:53.660
It's true.

12:56.210 --> 13:00.300
I am Ymir! The blood of the king
runs through me!

13:02.210 --> 13:05.050
And once again... I told more lies.

13:07.050 --> 13:09.390
If that's what it took 
to save everyone else...

13:10.930 --> 13:11.890
However...

13:13.480 --> 13:15.050
Things didn't work that way.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.390
No!

13:28.240 --> 13:32.040
Stop... Please, stop! I'm begging you!

13:38.880 --> 13:40.220
That's when I knew...

13:41.800 --> 13:43.590
This was my punishment.

13:45.590 --> 13:50.680
It's not that I was being punished
for deceiving all those people.

13:52.180 --> 13:56.170
It was for convincing myself to believe...
to feel needed by someone.

13:57.140 --> 14:00.050
It's what I deserved for
continuing to lie to myself.

14:01.020 --> 14:02.440
This was my punishment.

14:14.370 --> 14:16.170
It's a Titan! Run!

14:54.490 --> 14:56.250
When I opened my eyes...

14:57.790 --> 15:00.470
...what I saw was freedom 
spread out before me.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.580
If there was such a thing as fate,
I can only laugh at how fickle it can be.

15:09.590 --> 15:10.840
And in that moment...

15:12.300 --> 15:13.810
...I made a promise to myself.

15:15.430 --> 15:17.690
I was done with telling lies.

15:18.930 --> 15:21.580
I wasn't going to lie to myself anymore.

15:23.610 --> 15:26.100
From then on, I'd live honest to myself.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.690
So? What ever happened with that?

15:32.280 --> 15:37.200
She was given the name Christa Lenz
and sent off to become a cadet.

15:37.200 --> 15:41.410
What a pity. She would have been
better off not being born.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.540
Are you talking about me?!

15:46.000 --> 15:48.710
Come on, now. It makes no difference to me.

15:54.350 --> 15:55.390
And then...

15:57.430 --> 15:58.930
Hey, you.

15:58.930 --> 16:00.890
So you're trying to do something "nice," huh?

16:02.770 --> 16:03.890
Uh...

16:04.730 --> 16:06.250
And then I met you.

16:08.280 --> 16:13.170
I could tell right away...
...that you were the same as me...

16:13.740 --> 16:15.780
That you fed yourself lies...

16:16.700 --> 16:18.540
Give your hearts!

16:20.160 --> 16:20.960
Yes, Sir!

16:22.000 --> 16:26.030
That you were someone desperately trying
to convince yourself...

16:27.540 --> 16:29.720
But you know, Christa...

16:31.130 --> 16:34.970
That's why... I won't ask you to understand.

16:36.930 --> 16:37.700
Just that...

16:39.010 --> 16:40.990
...that you give me one last time...

16:42.060 --> 16:44.360
...to be honest with myself.

16:45.650 --> 16:46.520
I'm sorry...

16:49.070 --> 16:51.910
In this environment, I'm 
the strongest one here.

16:56.870 --> 16:58.660
Q-Quit it, Ymir!

16:58.660 --> 17:03.750
Don't you think a forest like this
is where I can shine the most? Well?

17:12.130 --> 17:14.839
Ymir! Stop! We'll fall!

17:14.839 --> 17:16.550
Do you think I care?

17:16.890 --> 17:21.349
If I became a Titan, I might be
powerless compared to you,

17:21.349 --> 17:23.520
but I can jump through the 
trees and move swiftly.

17:24.180 --> 17:28.480
I could snatch Eren away from you
and go back to meet up with the Scouts...

17:29.060 --> 17:30.280
...and probably succeed.

17:33.150 --> 17:36.570
If you don't agree to take
Christa with you right now,

17:36.570 --> 17:39.410
I'll get in your way and 
fight you right here.

17:39.410 --> 17:42.660
Wh-What are you saying?!
Don't you care what happens to her?!

17:42.660 --> 17:44.080
We can't help her that way!

17:44.620 --> 17:46.670
Yeah, that's fine.

17:47.290 --> 17:53.090
Even if it means taking her future away,
I'll do what it takes to live and meet her.

17:53.510 --> 17:56.590
I might be the shittiest 
person there ever was.

17:56.970 --> 17:58.870
You guys don't know what it's like.

17:59.720 --> 18:04.850
She knows how awful I am,
and yet she still smiles at me... that girl.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.480
You...

18:06.480 --> 18:08.100
Don't be mad at me.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.190
I have a plan for it.

18:10.520 --> 18:14.470
If I stay and fight, it should be easier
for you to escape anyways!

18:15.190 --> 18:17.990
Or would you rather stay 
and kill each other?!

18:17.990 --> 18:20.310
Do you want me to prove how crazy I am?!

18:33.460 --> 18:34.420
A light?

18:34.630 --> 18:37.420
Straight ahead in the forest! I saw a light!

18:37.840 --> 18:40.840
It's the light that appears
when a Titan transforms!

18:40.840 --> 18:42.300
Then we're just in time.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.720
Soldiers, disperse!

18:44.520 --> 18:46.670
We believe the enemy has already transformed!

18:47.140 --> 18:48.940
Locate Eren and recover him!

18:59.360 --> 19:00.820
Another one of the Police!

19:00.820 --> 19:02.370
Battle is not our objective!

19:02.950 --> 19:05.420
Prioritize recovery and retreat!

19:06.500 --> 19:08.250
Phil! Round up the horses!

19:08.250 --> 19:09.050
Yes, Sir!

19:14.040 --> 19:16.880
First thing is to find the enemy
and let the others know!

19:17.050 --> 19:19.130
They should be fleeing from the forest!

19:19.220 --> 19:19.990
Break!

19:21.390 --> 19:22.140
Eren.

19:22.140 --> 19:22.870
Where are you?!

19:28.520 --> 19:29.980
Is that the scream of a Titan?

19:30.560 --> 19:31.980
It came from ahead!

19:38.530 --> 19:39.860
You can't hide from me!

19:40.030 --> 19:41.280
Wait!

19:42.990 --> 19:44.030
This is Ymir!

19:44.330 --> 19:46.930
She's the one they took! In Titan form!

19:47.910 --> 19:50.950
Hey, Ymir! Why are you the only one here?!

19:52.330 --> 19:55.880
Where's Eren?!
What about Reiner!? Bertholdt?!

19:59.010 --> 20:00.510
So that's Ymir?

20:00.510 --> 20:03.050
Did she turn into a Titan
and fight with Reiner?!

20:03.260 --> 20:04.470
Ymir?

20:04.470 --> 20:07.810
Did you get away from Reiner?!
Where are they?!

20:07.810 --> 20:10.290
Tell us anything, Ymir!

20:12.020 --> 20:13.480
Say something already!

20:14.100 --> 20:16.300
Hey, ugly! We're in a hurry!

20:18.480 --> 20:20.360
Is she keeping an eye out for Reiner?

20:23.410 --> 20:24.620
Something's not right.

20:25.530 --> 20:28.830
Why... is she looking 
at everybody one by one?

20:29.080 --> 20:30.140
Ymir!

20:32.000 --> 20:32.960
Thank goodness!

20:33.460 --> 20:34.710
You're all right!

20:37.290 --> 20:37.950
Huh?

20:42.760 --> 20:43.590
No...

20:43.680 --> 20:44.590
She...

20:45.050 --> 20:46.800
She ate Christa!

20:50.680 --> 20:52.900
Don't just stand there! Chase her!

20:57.360 --> 20:59.570
She's fast! We're losing her!

20:59.940 --> 21:01.320
Why would Ymir do that?!

21:01.320 --> 21:05.660
I can't be the only one who could've 
guessed it would turn out this way!

21:05.660 --> 21:08.030
Yeah! She's clearly hostile to us now!

21:08.330 --> 21:12.800
Looks like she's cooperating with Reiner!
She lured us right in!

21:14.460 --> 21:16.000
Here she comes, Reiner.

21:16.210 --> 21:16.990
Right.

21:46.030 --> 21:46.910
Oh no...

21:47.740 --> 21:49.460
Eren's being taken away!

21:50.780 --> 21:51.720
Don't stop!

21:52.330 --> 21:53.870
Get on your horse and chase!

22:01.460 --> 22:03.190
I'm getting him back no matter what!

22:04.510 --> 22:07.090
Even if it means trading my life for it!

23:41.440 --> 23:43.690
The battle of pursuit begins.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.340
The hunters and the hunted.

23:47.480 --> 23:50.220
The intense emotions of friends made foe...
spill and clash on the battlefield.

23:54.030 --> 23:56.450
But soldiers are falling far too quickly.

23:57.660 --> 24:04.170
In a gamble waging the fate of humanity,
Erwin executes a do-or-die strategy.

24:05.130 --> 24:11.680
"Charge"

24:05.590 --> 24:06.540
Next episode:

24:08.030 --> 24:09.140
