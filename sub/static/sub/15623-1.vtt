02:18.771 --> 02:20.636
Okay. Is it on?

02:21.341 --> 02:22.330
Yeah, yeah.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.501
Okay. Okay.

02:24.744 --> 02:28.009
This is for our friend,
Hal Fields.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.275
Hal, we love you.

02:52.272 --> 02:56.231
Arthur, you're coming to
live with me now, okay?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.944
This is my car.

03:15.995 --> 03:20.261
This is the dining room where
people come and eat sometimes.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.864
This is the living room.

03:32.178 --> 03:33.770
That's the bathroom.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.491
<i>This is 2003.</i>

03:47.493 --> 03:48.755
<i>This is what</i>
<i>the sun looks like,</i>

03:49.462 --> 03:51.862
<i>and the stars, nature...</i>

03:52.098 --> 03:53.395
<i>This is the President.</i>

03:55.335 --> 03:57.394
<i>And this is the sun in 1955.</i>

03:58.238 --> 03:59.330
<i>And the stars,</i>

04:00.173 --> 04:01.401
<i>and nature,</i>

04:01.941 --> 04:05.900
<i>and cars and phones</i>
<i>and movies and the President.</i>

04:06.412 --> 04:08.141
<i>These are what</i>
<i>pets looked like.</i>

04:09.249 --> 04:10.841
<i>These are fireworks.</i>

04:12.018 --> 04:13.280
<i>This was smoking.</i>

04:15.255 --> 04:17.620
<i>This is what it looked like</i>
<i>when people kissed.</i>

04:19.325 --> 04:20.656
<i>When they were happy.</i>

04:21.894 --> 04:23.384
<i>When they were sad.</i>

04:24.297 --> 04:26.356
<i>My parents got</i>
<i>married in 1955.</i>

04:27.367 --> 04:30.427
<i>He was a museum director</i>
<i>and she fixed up old houses.</i>

04:30.970 --> 04:33.905
<i>They had a child and they</i>
<i>stayed married for 44 years,</i>

04:34.207 --> 04:35.697
<i>until she died in their bed,</i>

04:36.042 --> 04:39.842
<i>after four months of cancer,</i>
<i>and eating French toast for every meal,</i>

04:40.346 --> 04:42.644
<i>and watching</i>
<i>the</i> Teletubbies <i>every day,</i>

04:42.715 --> 04:44.512
<i>and confusing white straws</i>
<i>for her cigarettes,</i>

04:44.584 --> 04:47.348
<i>and skipping back</i>
<i>and forth through time inside her head.</i>

04:48.588 --> 04:51.421
<i>Six months later,</i>
<i>my father told me he was gay.</i>

04:52.258 --> 04:53.919
<i>He had just turned 75.</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:55.116
I'm gay.

04:55.528 --> 04:58.019
<i>I always remember him wearing a purple</i>
<i>sweater when he told me this,</i>

04:58.097 --> 04:59.587
<i>but, actually,</i>
<i>he wore a robe.</i>

04:59.666 --> 05:00.758
I'm gay.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.095
I'm gay.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.031
I loved your mother, but...

05:04.203 --> 05:08.162
...now I want to
explore this side.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.670
I don't wanna be
just theoretically gay.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.006
I wanna do
something about it.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.741
I wanna do
something about it.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.711
I wanna do
something about it.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.619
<i>He changed</i>
<i>all his clothes.</i>

05:21.054 --> 05:23.045
<i>He got a boyfriend, Andy,</i>

05:23.156 --> 05:25.056
<i>a physical trainer</i>
<i>who was also studying</i>

05:25.124 --> 05:27.752
<i>for his professional</i>
<i>pyrotechnic license.</i>

05:27.894 --> 05:31.159
Since I came out to my
father, he never speaks to me.

05:31.230 --> 05:34.028
That's why I've been always
attracted to older men.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.827
<i>He found an out gay priest</i>
<i>to guide him spiritually.</i>

05:39.005 --> 05:40.996
<i>He saw a therapist</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

05:41.140 --> 05:42.732
<i>He joined the Prime Timers,</i>

05:42.809 --> 05:43.935
<i>movie night,</i>

05:44.010 --> 05:45.272
<i>Los Angeles Pride.</i>

05:46.446 --> 05:50.246
<i>And then four years after he came out,</i>
<i>he died in this room.</i>

06:22.181 --> 06:26.709
Look, it's lonely out here, so you'd
better learn how to talk with me.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.062
I know. I know.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.219
Calm. Calm, calm breaths.

07:03.856 --> 07:04.948
Calm.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.355
Oliver!

07:09.595 --> 07:11.256
Please help me
with all these ropes.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.560
Pop, Pop,
stop, stop, stop.

07:13.633 --> 07:14.622
You're gonna
hurt yourself.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.567
Mr. Fields, we're gonna have
to secure your arms again, okay?

07:20.807 --> 07:22.240
You two married?

07:22.775 --> 07:24.037
No, Pop.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.169
Why not? She's great.

07:26.245 --> 07:30.272
Yeah, she's a great nurse in the
hospital, but we don't really know her.

07:30.383 --> 07:31.782
You're very high
on drugs.

07:31.884 --> 07:35.945
Yes, you've always had
some very good reasons,

07:36.622 --> 07:38.351
...haven't you?
- No, Pop,

07:38.424 --> 07:40.255
I just don't wanna be
like you and Mom.

07:40.326 --> 07:41.657
Well...

07:42.829 --> 07:43.921
Thank you.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.473
Oliver?

08:08.588 --> 08:10.249
Ollie, you can do better.

08:14.126 --> 08:15.957
That's good.

08:24.904 --> 08:27.930
Go and have your own
experiences with your own people.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.873
I'll be right here.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.407
I'm a human.
I'm not a dog.

08:36.849 --> 08:40.114
And you're a Jack Russell
and that's a breed.

08:41.087 --> 08:45.217
Your personality was created
by this guy, John Russell,

08:45.291 --> 08:47.725
who was a hunting
enthusiast in the 1800s.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.559
And he bred your ancestors for their
stamina and their courage for the hunt.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.858
You think you're you when
you wanna chase the foxes,

08:58.838 --> 09:01.500
but other people planted
that in you years ago.

09:02.341 --> 09:03.865
And now,
somewhat arbitrarily,

09:03.943 --> 09:06.434
you're considered
very cute by us humans.

09:07.713 --> 09:12.446
And we keep breeding you not
to chase foxes, but to be cute.

09:12.518 --> 09:15.351
And we put you in
television shows and movies,

09:16.088 --> 09:17.612
and you're chasing
tennis balls

09:17.690 --> 09:21.148
because they're as close to
a fox as you're gonna get.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.572
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.739
<i>Let's read this one.</i>
<i>I found a lot of books.</i>

10:10.209 --> 10:11.801
Yeah, all right.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.173
Give me
the flashlight.

10:15.214 --> 10:16.681
- Nice.
- That's nice.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.620
Andy brought those for you.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.088
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:29.261 --> 10:31.252
Who did that painting?

10:31.364 --> 10:34.197
Well, I don't know. It's
just a painting on the wall.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.292
And these?

10:38.371 --> 10:40.066
They're
just photos, Pop.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.233
But how do they relate
to the exhibit?

10:43.876 --> 10:46.572
They're just personal
photos. They're not art.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.312
And that's the
water sprinkler thing.

10:52.752 --> 10:53.946
Well, it's beautiful.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.009
What is?

10:56.055 --> 10:58.853
Putting the Japanese Gardens
there. It's just beautiful.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.381
Hal?

11:01.260 --> 11:02.750
Andy!

11:12.238 --> 11:13.933
I brought
something for you.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.806
We made
a recording for you.

11:21.881 --> 11:22.870
Oh, God.

11:24.717 --> 11:26.275
<i>This is for our friend, Hal Fields.</i>

11:26.352 --> 11:27.341
Oh, my God.

11:27.653 --> 11:28.711
- Huh?
- Yeah.

11:50.976 --> 11:53.672
Jesus, Liz. Another
band that wants portraits.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.714
Well, at least
it pays the rent.

11:57.416 --> 12:01.853
You do something decent once
and that's all people ever want.

12:04.423 --> 12:05.412
Hi, Liz.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.390
- Oliver?
- Yeah?

12:13.666 --> 12:14.826
The pen is not
your friend.

12:15.868 --> 12:19.065
The paper is
not your friend.

12:19.872 --> 12:22.340
The party is your friend.
We're your friends.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.841
Your friends
are your friends.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.568
Okay?

12:28.547 --> 12:30.811
<i>I've got the skills</i>

12:30.883 --> 12:32.578
<i>He's got the moves</i>

12:32.651 --> 12:34.278
I've got the moves.

12:34.353 --> 12:35.877
- I've got the skills.
- I've got the skills.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.551
Arthur, you haven't been
invited to this party.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.560
You're gonna stay
and look after the house.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.849
You remember when
Oliver was funny,

13:09.989 --> 13:14.483
and he could actually, like,
talk in complete sentences?

13:14.593 --> 13:15.617
Funny, funny...
I don't think...

13:15.694 --> 13:16.683
Funny. Yeah.

13:16.762 --> 13:20.129
Fun. But not funny, unless,
like, serious is funny.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.667
Then he's fucking
hilarious. But...

13:22.768 --> 13:23.928
Lovable. Lovable.

13:24.003 --> 13:25.095
Yeah, very lovable.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.468
You are very lovable.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.799
Hey, what's up!

13:31.877 --> 13:32.969
Step aside.

13:34.947 --> 13:35.936
Step aside.

13:50.429 --> 13:52.522
He is so cute!
Does he do tricks?

13:52.598 --> 13:53.587
No.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.463
His name is Arthur.
He doesn't do tricks.

13:55.534 --> 13:56.626
- No?
- No.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.828
Arthur. Sit.

13:58.938 --> 13:59.962
Oh, my God!

14:00.406 --> 14:02.567
Hi. Shake.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.073
Oh, my God.
He's so cute. I want him.

14:06.145 --> 14:09.410
Does it make you
feel powerful to order my dog around?

14:09.481 --> 14:10.914
Maybe give you
a sense of power?

14:10.983 --> 14:12.541
You're
being a therapist!

14:12.685 --> 14:13.674
Freud!

14:13.752 --> 14:14.776
Thanks, yeah.
Very good.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.552
Bye, Arthur.

14:19.558 --> 14:22.356
Well, I didn't ask for this.
Who would ask for this?

14:22.494 --> 14:26.089
This color, this nose,
this cheek, this chin.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.632
You know,
this is my life.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.328
This isn't a story.
This isn't a joke.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.395
Yeah.

14:33.505 --> 14:34.995
I'm so glad
you came, Doc.

14:35.407 --> 14:38.137
Just really good to get
this stuff off my chest.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.303
I'm sorry.
Our time is up

14:41.981 --> 14:43.073
for this week.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.407
Thank you
for coming in.

14:53.525 --> 14:54.514
Oh.

14:55.294 --> 14:56.318
I was just...

14:56.829 --> 14:59.024
I was gonna take
a break, actually.

15:02.801 --> 15:03.859
Okay.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.732
I guess we should
start with your mother.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.244
Well, then,
your father.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.179
I don't understand.
You can't talk?

15:24.356 --> 15:27.587
Is it a mental problem?
Do you need analysis?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.563
It's a physical problem.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.916
I was doing such
a good job of hiding it.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.345
How could you tell?

16:12.738 --> 16:14.205
Clearly,
I'm gonna need a drink.

16:14.974 --> 16:15.963
You?

16:16.442 --> 16:19.411
You stay here. Yeah.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.044
- No, it's not a natural color for a chicken.
- No.

16:24.116 --> 16:27.711
And you see what happens when
you free yourself from the cage,

16:27.786 --> 16:28.844
walk away
from the factory?

16:28.921 --> 16:30.582
You just have no real color.
You're like...

16:30.656 --> 16:31.918
Hey, can you...

16:31.991 --> 16:33.185
Hey, there.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.587
Uh-oh. One.
Uh-oh. Two.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.649
Two drinks.

16:35.728 --> 16:36.854
What does that mean...
One, two.

16:36.929 --> 16:37.987
Well, that's two people.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.428
- Two people. A girl and a guy?
- Hopefully.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.965
Yeah. Wow.
Making moves.

16:45.471 --> 16:46.631
<i>Hello?</i>

16:46.705 --> 16:47.967
- Oliver?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

16:48.040 --> 16:49.905
I'm not sorry I woke you.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.645
<i>I went to Act Bar tonight.</i>

16:55.080 --> 16:56.604
- <i>You did?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

16:56.715 --> 17:00.116
They had some
wonderfully loud music.

17:05.991 --> 17:07.652
What kind of
music is that?

17:07.726 --> 17:09.159
<i>Probably house music.</i>

17:09.428 --> 17:12.396
House music. Okay.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.330
House, house music.

17:15.401 --> 17:17.198
<i>Did you meet anyone?</i>

17:17.301 --> 17:19.202
- <i>Did you meet anyone?</i>
- No.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.703
Young gay men don't go
for older gay men.

17:24.443 --> 17:25.740
<i>You have it easy.</i>

17:42.594 --> 17:44.186
Would you
like to dance?

18:47.926 --> 18:48.915
Hello.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.399
Can I give you
my number?

18:59.538 --> 19:00.527
Thanks.

19:08.280 --> 19:12.512
I feel bad dragging Arthur to
the party. I should get home.

19:16.855 --> 19:18.550
It was really
nice meeting you.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.184
<i>Au revoir.</i>

19:24.263 --> 19:25.287
Yeah.

19:44.783 --> 19:45.943
Hello?

19:51.223 --> 19:52.656
Is that you?

19:55.394 --> 19:56.918
One beep means "yes"?

20:00.365 --> 20:03.630
I've always wanted to have a phone
call with someone who doesn't talk.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.839
You wanna do something?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.198
Now?

20:12.945 --> 20:15.140
Okay, I'm parked just
right up the street.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.790
Okay. You point,
I'll drive.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.074
This way?

21:12.738 --> 21:13.727
Nice place.

21:31.556 --> 21:33.888
Oh, my mother. My mother
died five years ago.

21:33.959 --> 21:34.948
Oh, man.

21:35.327 --> 21:36.817
Oh, you spoke.

21:39.164 --> 21:41.155
I'm not supposed to.

21:44.369 --> 21:48.396
My father died two
months ago, almost three.

21:52.277 --> 21:53.904
He was gay.

21:56.114 --> 21:58.378
He was gay the whole
time they were married.

21:59.384 --> 22:02.512
He came out
after my mother died,

22:03.355 --> 22:04.754
and he was
75 years old.

22:08.226 --> 22:09.386
Sorry.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.346
Can we just sleep?

23:11.456 --> 23:13.617
Sure. Sure.

23:36.047 --> 23:37.071
Oliver.

23:44.623 --> 23:46.682
How long are you here
when you get back?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.121
A year?

23:51.797 --> 23:52.786
A month?

23:55.901 --> 23:57.493
Right. And then?

23:58.103 --> 24:00.196
You're filming here.
Acting.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.937
And after?

24:04.810 --> 24:07.370
Just somewhere else.
Where?

24:22.994 --> 24:24.018
Yes.

25:20.118 --> 25:23.212
Hello, house.
Hello, Oliver.

25:25.924 --> 25:28.688
Jesus, Pop,
you get so much mail.

25:36.001 --> 25:38.435
<i>Hal, it's remarkable how</i>
<i>well you've recovered</i>

25:38.570 --> 25:40.231
<i>from being on</i>
<i>the ventilator.</i>

25:42.841 --> 25:43.830
But?

25:46.011 --> 25:49.105
The bronchoscopy
revealed a mass

25:49.180 --> 25:52.775
about the size of a quarter
located in your lower right lung.

25:53.685 --> 25:56.620
I'm afraid the biopsy
showed it's cancerous.

25:59.758 --> 26:01.225
Uh-huh. I see.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.221
It appears
to have spread

26:04.296 --> 26:07.060
to the large hilar lymph
nodes in your chest and liver.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.827
<i>With the already weakened state of</i>
<i>your heart and lungs,</i>

26:11.102 --> 26:14.037
surgery isn't possible,
given its location.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.966
We can start
radiation treatments

26:18.043 --> 26:20.568
<i>and see if you're</i>
<i>strong enough for chemo.</i>

26:21.379 --> 26:23.142
<i>You will be able</i>
<i>to go home.</i>

26:31.089 --> 26:32.556
Do you have
any questions?

26:35.694 --> 26:36.718
No.

26:38.496 --> 26:39.485
Thank you.

26:43.401 --> 26:44.425
I'm sorry.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.470
Well, let's not rush
out and tell everyone.

26:49.007 --> 26:50.201
Andy?

26:51.509 --> 26:53.306
No need to
get him up a tree.

27:03.555 --> 27:04.954
Can you read me
something?

27:08.126 --> 27:12.688
"The Brazilian ballet star is already
known not only as a skilled partner,

27:12.764 --> 27:15.892
"but also as a gifted
and versatile dancer

27:15.967 --> 27:19.403
"who adeptly fields roles ranging
from the strictly classical..."

27:46.698 --> 27:48.893
<i>Yeah, he's fine.</i>
<i>He sleeps on your bed.</i>

27:48.967 --> 27:49.956
<i>But is he eating?</i>

27:50.135 --> 27:51.124
Yeah. Yeah, he's eating.

27:51.202 --> 27:52.430
Oh, God, I worry
so much about...

27:52.504 --> 27:54.028
Oh. Here we are.

27:55.473 --> 27:56.804
What have you
got in there?

27:56.875 --> 27:58.001
A slug.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.010
Andy, you can't bring
that kind of thing...

28:00.111 --> 28:01.100
You cannot.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.476
I can. Look.

28:02.547 --> 28:03.809
Fuck you.

28:05.316 --> 28:07.079
It's time for inspection.

28:07.552 --> 28:09.417
- Hello, Mr. Fields.
- Hello.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.689
I'm Andy.
Hal's boyfriend.

28:13.158 --> 28:14.489
I'm Sophia.

28:16.161 --> 28:20.120
You know, I have the right to
be here as much as anyone else.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.428
Go take a walk.
Calm yourself.

28:27.639 --> 28:28.970
What was all that?

28:30.675 --> 28:32.540
Andy hasn't
had it easy, too.

28:33.578 --> 28:34.636
Be nice to him.

28:38.249 --> 28:39.307
Excuse me.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.687
Andy,

28:47.926 --> 28:49.860
where did you get these?

28:57.035 --> 28:59.595
Guys, guys,
this is to us.

28:59.671 --> 29:00.660
Cheers.

29:00.739 --> 29:01.865
Cheers.

29:05.443 --> 29:07.968
Drinking is not
allowed in the room.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.074
It's not?

29:15.286 --> 29:16.275
I'm sorry.

29:17.455 --> 29:19.013
No, no, no.
No, no.

29:19.891 --> 29:21.358
She's a wonderful nurse.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.085
Here's to healthcare.

29:24.562 --> 29:25.756
To healthcare!

29:26.698 --> 29:29.132
What did you do with
my father? He was so polite.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.964
Well, I invited him, but
he never returns my calls.

29:35.039 --> 29:37.303
Two, four,
six, eight.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.400
That's it? That's
all you're gonna tell me.

29:39.477 --> 29:41.638
I'm gonna meet her
at her hotel again, okay?

29:42.514 --> 29:43.503
You happy?

29:43.982 --> 29:45.472
Yeah. I'm very happy.

29:46.084 --> 29:47.449
Are you happy?

29:48.453 --> 29:49.442
Here's eight.

29:50.188 --> 29:53.021
We haven't actually had a
conversation yet, so, you know...

29:55.627 --> 29:58.323
You're thinking
about her all the time.

29:58.596 --> 29:59.756
And you know
that because?

29:59.831 --> 30:02.129
Because you're not
talking about it.

30:03.001 --> 30:04.366
I know you.

30:06.204 --> 30:07.432
It's true.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.106
It's embarrassing. I'm 38,
falling for a girl again.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.171
It's like I lost
the instructions

30:17.248 --> 30:18.613
<i>or I never had them.</i>

30:22.620 --> 30:23.712
Where's Pop?

30:24.556 --> 30:25.921
At the museum.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.524
Is something wrong
with you guys?

30:33.998 --> 30:35.693
What, are you
in the FBI?

30:35.767 --> 30:36.825
No.

30:39.370 --> 30:40.803
CIA?

30:40.872 --> 30:41.861
No.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.735
- KGB?
- No.

30:46.411 --> 30:48.242
SLA? PTA?

30:48.313 --> 30:49.302
No.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.438
BMW?

30:56.354 --> 30:58.447
There's nothing wrong
with me and Pop.

31:06.898 --> 31:09.662
When you feel bad,
you go into your room

31:09.734 --> 31:12.498
and scream as loud as you
can for a minute or two

31:12.570 --> 31:13.935
and then it's out of you.

31:14.572 --> 31:16.301
It's called catharsis.

31:30.521 --> 31:32.182
I don't feel
like screaming.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.088
You will.

31:58.716 --> 32:00.377
What the fuck is that?

32:00.885 --> 32:03.649
L-E-It. Elliot.

32:03.821 --> 32:05.584
Well, that's ridiculous.

32:05.657 --> 32:06.646
I know.

32:07.525 --> 32:08.822
You're not
very supportive.

32:08.893 --> 32:10.758
Well, it's just like
copying something

32:10.828 --> 32:12.853
that someone, like, did
30 years ago in the Bronx.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.059
Well, yeah. I'm a part of a
tradition of civil disobedience.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.999
Something bigger
than myself.

32:20.538 --> 32:21.835
How's it work?

32:21.906 --> 32:23.635
You have to shake it.
Shake it.

32:45.997 --> 32:47.157
What was that?

32:47.231 --> 32:50.496
Historical consciousness.
Something bigger than myself.

32:52.870 --> 32:54.360
Let's do it again.

32:54.739 --> 32:56.604
Okay, but
when you see her,

32:56.674 --> 33:00.235
don't tell her that you painted
historical consciousness on the wall.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.051
He's sweet.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.463
He misses your dad.

33:48.593 --> 33:52.461
Maybe we could just
talk for a second.

33:54.165 --> 33:55.325
Right.

34:05.343 --> 34:08.402
Well, my name is Anna.

34:11.649 --> 34:13.014
You're worried
you can't trust me

34:13.083 --> 34:14.779
because you
don't know who I am.

34:17.054 --> 34:20.114
I get it.
That makes sense to me.

35:04.469 --> 35:06.198
Oliver, stop it.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.901
This music's old.

35:13.711 --> 35:14.700
It's black.

35:16.547 --> 35:20.881
Black music's the deepest
'cause they suffered the most.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.681
Them and the Jews.

35:25.089 --> 35:26.556
In my next life,

35:28.326 --> 35:30.521
I'm gonna marry
a good hot-blooded Jew.

35:32.563 --> 35:34.531
Someone full of emotion.

35:36.767 --> 35:38.257
I'm Jewish, right?

35:39.337 --> 35:40.599
You're a quarter.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.298
I'm a half.

35:44.008 --> 35:45.202
Your father's none.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.936
He has the least emotions.

35:50.114 --> 35:52.139
You'll have more
emotions than him.

35:52.216 --> 35:53.979
But I'll have
the most emotions.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.153
You get to play chauffeur, but
only to the bottom of the hill.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.860
You're turning into
a wonderful driver.

36:24.649 --> 36:26.776
Excuse me,
Mrs. Fields?

36:27.919 --> 36:30.046
What, you're not allowed
to interact with the art?

36:30.121 --> 36:31.986
Well, it's just that...

36:32.924 --> 36:36.121
You too? You like
being a good citizen?

36:36.194 --> 36:37.183
No.

36:44.769 --> 36:46.634
Can you toss me
my camisole?

36:52.710 --> 36:53.972
No, my camisole.

37:02.186 --> 37:03.346
Camisole?

37:04.956 --> 37:06.787
You don't know
what a camisole is?

37:09.360 --> 37:11.260
I was brought up
by these animals,

37:12.029 --> 37:14.589
and they didn't
like questions.

37:14.665 --> 37:17.327
They were very frowned upon.
So, I had to guess.

37:19.437 --> 37:20.927
You can ask me anything.

37:23.908 --> 37:24.897
Anything?

37:33.551 --> 37:34.711
What's that there?

37:35.119 --> 37:36.586
- That's a tree.
- Yeah.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.354
- And cars.
- Uh-huh.

37:39.490 --> 37:40.923
Another building
like this one.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.016
Right.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.754
People in the building like us.

37:44.528 --> 37:47.429
Half of them think things
will never work out.

37:48.399 --> 37:51.459
The other half
believe in magic.

37:52.536 --> 37:54.731
It's like a war
between them.

37:59.243 --> 38:01.234
How do you know
so much about people?

38:01.979 --> 38:02.968
Oh.

38:05.182 --> 38:09.619
Well, you have to learn
how to read their faces.

38:13.691 --> 38:14.953
For example...

38:18.529 --> 38:20.588
Here is mad.

38:22.867 --> 38:23.856
Happy.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.166
Sometimes
it's just nothing.

38:32.543 --> 38:33.532
Oh, yeah?

38:33.611 --> 38:34.600
This is nothing.

38:36.580 --> 38:39.947
And they are good
at looking one way

38:41.118 --> 38:44.087
and being another way.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.956
<i>You don't know me.</i>
<i>I like that.</i>

38:50.027 --> 38:51.085
<i>No, that's not true.</i>

38:51.162 --> 38:52.186
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

38:52.263 --> 38:54.595
<i>Yeah, you have blonde hair that goes</i>
<i>down to about here.</i>

38:54.932 --> 38:57.492
<i>You smoke in non-smoking rooms.</i>
<i>You bite sometimes.</i>

38:57.601 --> 38:59.034
Okay, open your eyes.

39:02.873 --> 39:07.708
<i>Yeah, you drive on the sidewalk.</i>
<i>You were raised by animals.</i>

39:08.813 --> 39:12.510
<i>Sometimes you look very alone, like</i>
<i>you just got here.</i>

39:13.384 --> 39:15.511
<i>Yeah, you see,</i>
<i>you don't know me at all.</i>

39:26.797 --> 39:30.460
Someone flashy walks into your life
and you're just gonna fall for it.

39:34.605 --> 39:38.974
No, it doesn't work like that. There
are other steps, it's complicated.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.547
Yeah. Me, too.

39:45.483 --> 39:47.212
<i>What happened</i>
<i>with Michelle?</i>

39:50.121 --> 39:51.110
I don't know. You know.

39:51.188 --> 39:52.485
She seemed great.

39:53.190 --> 39:54.316
She was great.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.993
Well, maybe you should take
out a personal ad, you know,

39:58.062 --> 39:59.859
where you can explain
your situation.

39:59.930 --> 40:01.659
My situation?

40:01.732 --> 40:02.790
Yeah.

40:02.867 --> 40:06.496
I mean, you wanna be in a
relationship and you can't stay in one.

40:07.605 --> 40:10.005
That's your fatherly
advice, personal ads?

40:10.841 --> 40:12.138
Well...

40:12.977 --> 40:14.774
A lot of people use them.

40:15.613 --> 40:17.240
I did.

40:17.715 --> 40:18.704
What?

40:18.916 --> 40:22.408
If Andy wasn't going to be
monogamous, why should I be?

40:23.154 --> 40:24.553
Jesus, Pop.

40:25.022 --> 40:26.580
- Jesus yourself.
- Yeah?

40:30.728 --> 40:33.322
You look great, Hal.
So handsome.

40:33.664 --> 40:36.724
Hello, house.
Hello, Hal.

40:38.969 --> 40:39.993
Hello, Hal.

40:57.388 --> 41:00.516
Oh, God, what have you got this time?

41:00.591 --> 41:01.853
It's a green
caterpillar.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.655
No, no, no, you don't
have a green caterpillar.

41:03.727 --> 41:05.058
Yeah, I do.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.962
Oh, my God.
Gross! Oh, Jesus.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.128
Hey, you going?

41:14.205 --> 41:15.695
Yeah.
Michael's in town.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.532
Oh.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.333
Right.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.277
I thought he was
your boyfriend.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.216
At least I'm
the number one boyfriend.

41:31.789 --> 41:32.847
Pop.

41:34.358 --> 41:35.416
My stomach.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.824
All right, come on.

41:38.629 --> 41:39.618
Come on.

41:39.730 --> 41:40.719
Well, let's say...

41:40.798 --> 41:42.356
Arthur, down.

41:42.433 --> 41:45.402
Let's say,
since you were little,

41:45.970 --> 41:51.374
and you always dreamed
of some day getting a lion?

41:52.710 --> 41:54.371
And you wait and you wait
and you wait and you wait,

41:54.445 --> 41:56.913
and the lion doesn't come.

41:59.149 --> 42:01.242
Then along
comes a giraffe.

42:03.120 --> 42:08.023
You can be alone or you
can be with the giraffe.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.694
I'd wait for the lion.

42:14.598 --> 42:16.259
That's why
I worry about you.

42:21.605 --> 42:22.629
Here.

43:01.845 --> 43:05.144
You see, you'd like me to
be with someone like me.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.945
I like Andy because
he isn't like me.

43:09.753 --> 43:10.742
He's fun.

43:25.235 --> 43:26.998
Hey, what'd you get?

43:29.306 --> 43:32.571
Liv Ullmann.
Very serious.

43:33.944 --> 43:37.675
And I found
this crazy book.

43:38.816 --> 43:41.307
That's kind of
a classic American thing.

43:44.855 --> 43:48.689
Maybe we can figure out some
classic American things to do.

43:48.759 --> 43:49.748
Yeah.

43:51.462 --> 43:52.986
- Like 75.
- Mmm-hmm.

43:56.934 --> 43:58.902
Or 75 all the
way through...

43:59.370 --> 44:00.530
Through 80.

44:01.805 --> 44:04.603
Louise Brooks,
star of silent screen,

44:04.675 --> 44:07.371
effectively banned from
Hollywood in the early '30s,

44:07.444 --> 44:10.413
ended up working as a
salesgirl at Saks Fifth Avenue.

44:10.481 --> 44:11.778
I love her.

44:11.849 --> 44:13.111
And Veronica Lake.

44:14.218 --> 44:16.243
Was a pin-up model
and a film star.

44:16.787 --> 44:19.654
Success was short-lived,
a series of broken marriages.

44:19.723 --> 44:22.385
She struggled with mental
illness and alcoholism.

44:24.128 --> 44:27.120
She died of hepatitis
at the age of fifty-three.

44:28.799 --> 44:31.097
All these actor
stories end sad.

44:31.635 --> 44:33.364
I can tell you
that already.

44:33.871 --> 44:35.304
That's not a good thing.

44:42.446 --> 44:45.813
So. Now I want
real Mexican food.

44:46.650 --> 44:50.586
And I want to try page

44:51.722 --> 44:52.711
forty-six.

44:58.262 --> 45:00.162
- No.
- Yeah.

45:00.230 --> 45:01.322
Really?

45:01.398 --> 45:02.922
It's really good.

45:10.307 --> 45:11.968
What do you think?

45:15.512 --> 45:16.501
It's so good.

45:16.580 --> 45:17.774
- It's good.
- Mmm.

45:17.848 --> 45:19.440
- I wasn't sure you'd like it.
- Why?

45:19.516 --> 45:22.917
You're an actress and
staying in that fancy hotel.

45:25.656 --> 45:27.385
I like this place.

45:30.294 --> 45:32.319
I used to love hotels.

45:33.697 --> 45:38.600
But now I'm always in a new apartment
or in another hotel somewhere.

45:39.269 --> 45:43.433
How do you keep hold of
friends? Or boyfriends?

45:47.444 --> 45:51.073
Makes it very easy
to end up alone.

45:53.851 --> 45:55.443
To leave people.

46:00.858 --> 46:04.089
You can stay in the same place and
still find ways to leave people.

46:14.037 --> 46:15.402
You are like that?

46:17.074 --> 46:18.132
It's what you do?

46:28.285 --> 46:30.810
So, we are the same?

46:32.689 --> 46:33.815
Yeah, I guess so.

46:58.348 --> 46:59.838
Oh, did I wake you?

47:00.350 --> 47:01.977
Yeah. Thank you, Maria.

47:02.052 --> 47:03.349
And now that you're here,

47:03.887 --> 47:05.320
would you please
put those up there?

47:05.389 --> 47:06.981
What are you... Pop.

47:07.457 --> 47:08.446
What...

47:08.525 --> 47:09.651
I'm reorganizing.

47:10.194 --> 47:11.923
Prednisone
makes you crazy.

47:12.462 --> 47:15.022
I'm just not sleepy.
I feel great.

47:19.770 --> 47:21.101
Pop, you should rest.

47:21.538 --> 47:25.338
Soon as I finish these
papers. Right, papers?

47:25.676 --> 47:29.737
Right, Hal. As
soon as you're done, you can rest.

47:41.892 --> 47:43.086
What?

47:44.061 --> 47:45.460
Nothing.
You're pretty.

47:46.730 --> 47:47.754
No.

47:48.365 --> 47:49.354
Yeah.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.430
Jewish girls
are not pretty.

47:52.502 --> 47:55.733
They can be interesting
or cute, but not pretty.

47:56.673 --> 47:58.038
You're kidding, right?

47:58.375 --> 48:00.138
That's what
my mom told me.

48:02.813 --> 48:03.871
She did not.

48:03.947 --> 48:05.938
No, you're right.

48:06.450 --> 48:08.748
This girl at school
told me that,

48:08.819 --> 48:13.381
and I went home and my mom
said, "Anna, who told you that?"

48:13.457 --> 48:17.587
<i>This is what it looks like when Anna</i>
<i>tells me about being Jewish in 2003.</i>

48:18.095 --> 48:20.325
<i>And when I tell her</i>
<i>my mother was Jewish.</i>

48:20.497 --> 48:22.260
<i>And that my father</i>
<i>turned in his gay badge</i>

48:22.332 --> 48:24.357
<i>when my mother turned</i>
<i>in her Jewish badge.</i>

48:24.434 --> 48:26.732
<i>And they got married</i>
<i>in 1955.</i>

48:28.038 --> 48:30.734
<i>My mother didn't know she was Jewish</i>
<i>until she was thirteen.</i>

48:30.807 --> 48:32.001
<i>It was 1938.</i>

48:32.676 --> 48:34.371
<i>This is what</i>
<i>people looked like.</i>

48:35.345 --> 48:37.472
<i>And lions and giraffes.</i>

48:37.781 --> 48:40.113
<i>This man was</i>
<i>the Man of the Year.</i>

48:40.517 --> 48:43.247
<i>Her father tried to hide</i>
<i>that they were Jewish.</i>

48:43.320 --> 48:44.981
<i>This is the swim team</i>
<i>that asked her to leave</i>

48:45.055 --> 48:47.455
<i>once they discovered</i>
<i>that she was Jewish.</i>

48:47.891 --> 48:50.382
<i>This is what pretty</i>
<i>looked like in 1938.</i>

48:51.728 --> 48:54.128
<i>My father realized</i>
<i>he was gay when he was thirteen.</i>

48:54.197 --> 48:55.630
<i>It was 1938.</i>

48:56.233 --> 48:57.825
<i>This is what</i>
<i>pretty looked like.</i>

48:59.536 --> 49:01.834
<i>This is the high school</i>
<i>where they first met.</i>

49:02.105 --> 49:04.005
<i>This is the war</i>
<i>they both went to.</i>

49:04.341 --> 49:06.741
<i>And this man was popular</i>
<i>when they met again.</i>

49:07.144 --> 49:10.409
<i>This is the only place my father could hide</i>
<i>and have sex in the '50s.</i>

49:10.714 --> 49:12.978
<i>My father said if you got caught</i>
<i>by the vice squad,</i>

49:13.116 --> 49:14.583
<i>you could lose everything.</i>

49:15.152 --> 49:16.551
<i>This is everything.</i>

49:18.889 --> 49:20.584
<i>My father laid down</i>
<i>on a couch like this</i>

49:20.657 --> 49:23.717
<i>and told the psychiatrist</i>
<i>all his problems in 1955.</i>

49:24.494 --> 49:27.827
<i>The doctor told him</i>
<i>that homosexuality was a mental illness,</i>

49:27.898 --> 49:29.559
<i>but it could be cured.</i>

49:29.633 --> 49:31.328
<i>Not everyone got cured.</i>

49:32.135 --> 49:34.603
<i>This is where</i>
<i>my parents lived in 1955.</i>

49:34.671 --> 49:35.729
<i>And this is the home</i>

49:35.806 --> 49:38.502
<i>where the first gay-rights</i>
<i>group were secretly meeting.</i>

49:38.675 --> 49:41.405
<i>While they were</i>
<i>reciting their vows here in this church,</i>

49:41.745 --> 49:44.111
<i>Allen Ginsberg was</i>
<i>writing his famous poem,</i>

49:44.181 --> 49:46.479
Howl, <i>blocks away</i>
<i>in this room.</i>

49:46.550 --> 49:47.983
<i>"...who let themselves be</i>
<i>fucked in the ass</i>

49:48.051 --> 49:49.348
<i>"by saintly motorcyclists,</i>

49:49.419 --> 49:51.182
<i>"and screamed with joy,</i>

49:52.055 --> 49:54.990
<i>"who blew and were blown</i>
<i>by those human seraphim, the sailors,</i>

49:55.058 --> 49:57.959
<i>"caresses of Atlantic</i>
<i>and Caribbean love..."</i>

50:42.739 --> 50:46.903
Just do the portrait of them.
It's an album cover, right?

50:47.477 --> 50:49.001
That's all they want. Yeah?

50:49.079 --> 50:50.671
Yeah.

50:51.548 --> 50:52.810
Right.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.415
- Here, Pop.
- Oh, God.

51:02.559 --> 51:04.550
I know, I know.
Come on.

51:13.804 --> 51:18.639
Hey, no, no, no. That's Gay
Pride day stuff. Just leave those.

51:19.276 --> 51:20.368
All right.

51:22.646 --> 51:27.413
And that's gay book club.
You better leave those, too.

51:28.151 --> 51:30.176
But what about the chair?
Is the chair gay?

51:30.253 --> 51:33.450
The chair is not gay.
Obviously.

51:36.626 --> 51:38.787
Pop, Pop, the cord
won't go so far.

51:38.862 --> 51:40.352
To hell with it.

51:43.767 --> 51:44.995
Oh, what's that?

51:45.068 --> 51:46.535
Now that you're
out of the hospital,

51:46.603 --> 51:48.696
you'll have to exercise,
get you back into shape.

51:48.772 --> 51:50.262
That's a great idea.

51:50.373 --> 51:52.364
Okay, let's try it.
I'll show you how.

51:52.442 --> 51:53.466
Yeah, later on.

51:53.543 --> 51:55.067
I'm gonna make
myself some tea.

51:55.145 --> 51:58.342
Okay. I'll go clean it up.
It's a little bit...

52:03.286 --> 52:05.982
Your mother's vase
needs some flowers.

52:07.224 --> 52:10.022
You need to tell Andy
that you're not well.

52:11.228 --> 52:13.628
Pop, you're just out of the
hospital. You should take it easy.

52:13.697 --> 52:14.994
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:16.533 --> 52:18.262
<i>You'll tell him,</i>
<i>won't you?</i>

52:20.103 --> 52:21.127
Me?

52:22.506 --> 52:23.495
Please.

52:34.017 --> 52:35.006
Hey.

52:46.496 --> 52:48.760
You know, I tried to
have sex with women?

52:50.567 --> 52:52.034
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:52.335 --> 52:55.600
I just wanted you to know, I
tried. It just... It didn't work.

52:58.742 --> 53:00.642
Hey, I don't have
a problem with gay guys.

53:00.710 --> 53:02.371
Have you had
sex with a man?

53:03.313 --> 53:04.371
No.

53:06.483 --> 53:09.782
I heard that if a man hasn't
had sex with another man,

53:09.853 --> 53:12.048
he's always
afraid of gay men.

53:12.122 --> 53:13.885
You know,
they're a threat.

53:16.092 --> 53:17.559
I don't know, Andy.

53:17.727 --> 53:20.423
I didn't want you
to feel threatened.

53:21.131 --> 53:23.964
I don't wanna
have sex with you.

53:27.437 --> 53:28.836
What I do,

53:29.606 --> 53:32.040
most people wouldn't
even call it sex anyway.

53:32.576 --> 53:33.600
Okay.

53:34.477 --> 53:35.535
Okay.

53:37.547 --> 53:38.536
Hey.

53:48.325 --> 53:49.553
I couldn't tell him.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.052
That's okay.

53:56.466 --> 53:57.592
No, it's not.

53:58.501 --> 54:00.696
You can't hide this
from him. He loves you.

54:04.507 --> 54:06.805
For someone with so much
relationship advice,

54:06.876 --> 54:08.207
you seem awfully alone.

54:19.823 --> 54:21.256
Just act natural.

54:21.858 --> 54:24.224
When he's not looking,
we'll make a run for it.

54:24.961 --> 54:25.985
Okay?

54:43.079 --> 54:44.410
Don't, don't, don't.

54:46.983 --> 54:48.314
It's my dad.

54:55.659 --> 54:57.024
He's that bad?

55:05.268 --> 55:06.895
I'm gonna
let you be me.

55:10.540 --> 55:11.529
Okay.

55:17.447 --> 55:18.505
Annie?

55:27.357 --> 55:28.847
You never call me back.

55:30.360 --> 55:33.454
I'm busy. I'm shooting all the time.

55:35.899 --> 55:38.800
You know, I can't
stop thinking about...

55:39.602 --> 55:40.967
You know, about it.

55:41.504 --> 55:42.971
Doing it.

55:44.040 --> 55:45.268
Doing what?

55:46.643 --> 55:48.167
Killing myself.

55:49.979 --> 55:52.209
You are the only one
I can tell that to.

56:00.290 --> 56:02.554
You should tell Mom
about that, not me.

56:05.061 --> 56:06.551
You are my girl.

56:15.739 --> 56:17.764
Now I'll have
to kill you.

56:20.210 --> 56:21.939
Just as it was
going so well.

56:22.145 --> 56:24.375
I know. I'm sorry.

56:32.122 --> 56:33.146
Really?

56:49.739 --> 56:51.138
Hey, Anna.

56:51.641 --> 56:53.165
Hey, Oliver.

56:53.376 --> 56:55.037
How do you feel
about vandalism?

56:59.582 --> 57:00.776
I don't know.

57:01.818 --> 57:03.149
Pretty okay.

57:12.529 --> 57:13.962
Oliver,

57:14.130 --> 57:17.395
don't write any of that serious
stuff, okay? Just something funny.

57:17.467 --> 57:18.900
Girls like funny.

57:18.968 --> 57:20.128
- Okay?
- Okay.

57:26.309 --> 57:27.833
You know what?
Here, give me Arthur.

57:27.911 --> 57:29.936
We'll just stay here
and get arrested.

57:30.013 --> 57:31.002
You know, that's good.

57:32.515 --> 57:33.504
- Good?
- Mmm.

57:34.417 --> 57:35.441
You okay?

57:35.518 --> 57:36.507
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:40.390 --> 57:41.687
You okay?

57:42.192 --> 57:44.717
Yeah. I'm gonna stay
here with my new friend.

57:44.794 --> 57:45.852
Okay.

57:57.340 --> 57:58.329
Anna?

58:09.252 --> 58:10.651
I'm trying
to impress you.

58:10.720 --> 58:12.312
Really?

58:17.660 --> 58:19.127
It's working.

58:33.510 --> 58:35.102
Arthur, Arthur.

58:35.778 --> 58:37.712
No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.

58:37.780 --> 58:40.078
No problem. No problem.

58:40.683 --> 58:42.048
What's with this card?

58:45.321 --> 58:46.788
- Do you mind?
- No.

58:50.159 --> 58:51.524
- Thank you.
- All right.

59:17.487 --> 59:18.886
He looked like your dad.

59:20.557 --> 59:21.649
Yeah.

59:34.103 --> 59:35.127
Somewhere along the line

59:35.204 --> 59:37.263
he stopped admitting to
himself that he was sick.

59:51.187 --> 59:54.987
Oliver, this is Blake.
He's a wonderful man.

59:55.425 --> 59:57.950
Look. I finally
got a tattoo.

59:58.494 --> 01:00:00.428
Registration purposes,
of course.

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:02.856
Good for him.

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.395
<i>We did</i>
<i>a lot of shopping.</i>

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:09.470
<i>Bought all these books.</i>

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:10.732
Hello, Hal.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:11.796
Hello.

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:13.670
<i>New clothes.</i>

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.912
<i>He was obsessed</i>
<i>with Staples.</i>

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.043
<i>Bought a lot of plants.</i>

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:24.079
A lot of parties.

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.554
Well, glad you
could make it.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.490
I thought I was
cooking dinner.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.529
It's movie night,
you idiot.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.596
Hal,
you look wonderful.

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:40.033
I'm turning the corner
on this thing.

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:41.127
- Hi, Oliver.
- Hey, Oliver.

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:42.296
Hey.

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:46.236
<i>These political</i>
<i>letter-writing parties.</i>

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:50.345
<i>There was an out</i>
<i>gay congressman he was supporting.</i>

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:54.976
<i>He hired a secretary</i>
<i>he would dictate to.</i>

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.314
And one May morning...

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.615
<i>He started telling everyone</i>
<i>he was getting better.</i>

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:02.316
Why are you telling them
you're turning the corner?

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:04.215
Well...

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.420
You have
stage four cancer.

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:10.522
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.191
Pop,

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:14.861
there is no stage five.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.867
That's not what it means.

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:20.499
Well, then what
does it mean?

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:24.910
It just means that it's been
through three other stages.

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.354
What movie
are we watching?

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:40.223
<i>The Times of Harvey Milk,</i>
the first openly gay politician...

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:41.285
Yeah, I know
who Harvey Milk is.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:42.353
Good, good.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:45.299
<i>What really</i>
<i>counts is that a person care.</i>

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:48.098
<i>Does a person care</i>
<i>about his city or her city?</i>

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:49.195
<i>Is a person sensitive...</i>

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:51.836
Wrote an essay
about religion.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:56.675
"Eventually,
Jesus grew old.

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.543
"He could no longer walk far

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:01.310
"and he could no longer
preach in a loud voice.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:04.444
"One day he announced to his
apostles that he was departing.

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:06.917
"The three disciples
prayed with him,

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:09.116
"gave him water,
bathed and fed him.

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:12.919
"After gasping for breath
for several days,

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:15.225
"one morning,
just as dawn came,

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:17.857
"Jesus passed away."

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:23.202
You rewrote
Jesus' death?

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:25.672
It was far too violent.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.209
We need new stories.

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:31.510
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>I saw him really in love.</i>

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.574
<i>He sounds amazing.</i>

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:37.178
<i>But that must have</i>
<i>been crazy for you.</i>

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:34.134
Anna?

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:54.257
I couldn't sleep
and I wanted to walk around.

01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:59.630
You've lost so much.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.602
What if I can't
make it further?

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:09.134
If this is too much,

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:13.006
then we should
just stop.

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:24.558
Wait, wait.

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:27.296
Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.926
I don't wanna stop.

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:37.134
Oh!

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:43.577
- Ready?
- Yeah!

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.783
- Again!
- Again?

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.752
- Again!
- Again!

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.454
Fuck!

01:04:58.361 --> 01:04:59.487
Fuck!

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:00.722
Fuck!

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.190
Fuck!

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:03.391
Fuck!

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:05.861
Fuck!

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:08.634
Fuck!

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:10.839
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:12.263
Arthur.

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:13.330
Arthur!

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.238
Come on,
doggie, doggie.

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:16.471
Arthur.

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.342
I'm gonna go this way.
I'm gonna go farther out.

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:24.078
Whoo!

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.784
Ah! You're awake.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:30.148
Arthur says
you have to get up.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:33.118
He says
it's his day off.

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.095
- He speaks to you, too.
- Yeah.

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:38.023
He says now. Now. Now.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.692
Your English
is not so perfect.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.430
And he said 10 minutes.

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:57.215
You okay?

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.077
You did really well.

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:01.623
Yeah, I can't believe
that was your first time.

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:02.680
It was your first time.

01:06:02.758 --> 01:06:04.988
You watching all the humans
going around and around.

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:06.926
Excuse me, sir. There's
no dogs allowed in the building.

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.486
You need to remove him
from the premises, please.

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:10.725
If I leave him on his own,
he loses all control.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.358
I'm sorry. There's no dogs
allowed in the building.

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.561
- Yeah, yeah, but...
- Come on, please.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:16.264
If I leave him in the car, he cries,
he howls. I can't leave him in the car.

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:17.829
I'm sorry, no.
He needs to be removed.

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:21.338
I don't know what she's
saying and I don't like it.

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:22.604
You need to remove the dog
from the premises.

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:25.476
She's just talking in French. She's
saying, "It's okay, it's such a small dog."

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:27.277
- You're gonna call the authorities?
- All right, you know what?

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.749
- She's calling the authorities.
- Steal the skates.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:29.807
Steal the skates.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.488
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:55.575
- Come on, Arthur.
- Faster, faster.

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:57.271
Okay. Sorry.
Excuse me.

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:58.335
Hi.

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.621
I can't do it.

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:17.191
He doesn't always
call this much.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.490
Sometimes he's fine.

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:20.865
Yeah, well.

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:24.230
He shouldn't
do this to you.

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:37.677
Even if we don't answer
the phone, he's still here.

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:41.647
I run somewhere new and...

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.424
You're leaving
here soon.

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:51.388
Yeah.

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:54.432
I think you should
come to my house.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.997
Move in with me.

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:16.684
Would you want
a strange girl like me?

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:19.451
Yeah, a lot.

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.433
Do you cook?

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:30.036
Yes.

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:46.950
I would love that.

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:52.053
I'm really gonna
have to kill you now.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.993
Mmm. Why?

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:56.430
Because I'm falling
in love with you.

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:59.300
<i>Anna and I are</i>
<i>in a relationship in 2003.</i>

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:01.895
<i>This is what</i>
<i>the sun looks like</i>

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:03.368
<i>and the stars.</i>

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:05.770
<i>This is what it looks like when we eat.</i>

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:08.933
<i>When we tell each other</i>
<i>the stories in our heads.</i>

01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:11.175
<i>I was born in 1965.</i>

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:13.912
<i>Anna was born in 1971.</i>

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:15.640
<i>This is what</i>

<i>Her parents.</i>

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:20.149
<i>She left home</i>
<i>when she was sixteen.</i>

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:25.017
<i>She lived here and here</i>
<i>and here and here.</i>

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:29.255
<i>She had three serious relationships.</i>
<i>She left all of them.</i>

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:32.865
<i>I had four serious relationships.</i>
<i>I left them, too.</i>

01:09:32.968 --> 01:09:34.868
<i>Or let them fall apart.</i>

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:37.205
<i>We didn't go to this war.</i>

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:39.332
<i>We didn't have to</i>
<i>hide to have sex.</i>

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:41.770
<i>Our good fortune</i>
<i>allowed us to feel</i>

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.176
<i>a sadness that our parents</i>
<i>didn't have time for,</i>

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:47.580
<i>and a happiness that</i>

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:51.444

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:56.416

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.354
<i>Her ears.</i>

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:00.190
<i>Her feet.</i>

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:04.763
<i>This is what it looks like when she says,</i>
<i>"I love you," in 2003.</i>

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:07.798
<i>This is what it looks</i>
<i>like when she cries.</i>

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:11.434
<i>When she tells me there's</i>
<i>always a new empty room waiting for her.</i>

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.834
<i>They used to</i>
<i>make her feel free.</i>

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:17.911
<i>Now they make her feel</i>
<i>the opposite of free.</i>

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:53.881
- Last one.
- Oh, Lord.

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:55.450
I know.

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:03.384
There.

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.427
This is for you. Yeah.

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:09.895
Now, that means
Gay Pride.

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:11.262
Yeah, everyone
knows that.

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:12.425
No, they don't.

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:14.469
Yeah. Everyone
knows about that.

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:15.935
No. Of course not.
Don't be silly.

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:19.497
Pop, pretty much everyone
knows that that means Gay Pride.

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:21.200
- Do they really?
- Yeah.

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:29.483
Did you know?

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:32.245
About me?

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:36.580
No.

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:40.388
I just thought you
and Mom weren't in love.

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:43.055
We loved each other.

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.031
But you were gay
the whole time.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.829
Well, I worked
hard not to be.

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:48.597
For 44 years?

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:49.863
Yeah.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.507
I knew I was gay, though.

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:55.901
I mean, at parties I'd be staring
at the husbands and not the wives.

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:01.306
What about sex?

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:04.417
Well, she didn't think
I was the greatest lover.

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:08.213
But we made do.

01:12:10.659 --> 01:12:12.058
Look, I liked my life.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:15.225
The museum, our house.

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:17.293
That's what I wanted.

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:18.560
And Mom.

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:19.993
You wanted Mom,
too, right?

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:21.058
Yes!

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:22.501
Stop that.

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:31.237
She proposed to me,
you know.

01:12:34.216 --> 01:12:35.740
I said,

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:41.250
"Look, I love you, and we're great
buddies, but you know what I am."

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:42.617
And then she says,

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:47.752
"That doesn't matter.

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.230
"I'll fix that."

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:56.835
I thought,

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.636
"Oh, God.

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:04.406
"I'll try anything."

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:11.277
<i>Sex.</i>

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:12.780

<i>Spirit.</i>

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:26.558
<i>The first Gay Pride flag was made by</i>
<i>a man named Gilbert Baker in 1978.</i>

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:28.499
<i>He gave a meaning</i>
<i>to each color.</i>

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.337
<i>This man was President.</i>

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:31.595
<i>This was invented.</i>

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:33.338
<i>This is what</i>

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:34.901

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:40.306
<i>On November 27th, 1978,</i>
<i>Harvey Milk was shot and killed.</i>

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:45.147
<i>One week after, my father</i>
<i>opened his annual museum Christmas exhibit.</i>

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.688
<i>He collected stuffed animals</i>
<i>from people in the community</i>

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.189
<i>and he put them on display.</i>

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:52.253
<i>My father printed a quote</i>
<i>from</i> The Velveteen Rabbit

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:53.919
<i>in large type on the wall.</i>

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:57.831
<i>The stuffed rabbit asked,</i>
<i>"What is real?"</i>

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:01.601
<i>And the rabbit asked,</i>
<i>"Does it hurt?"</i>

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.669
<i>And the horse said,</i>
<i>"Sometimes."</i>

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:07.136
<i>"Does it happen all at once?"</i>

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:09.300
<i>"It takes a long time.</i>

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.774
<i>"Generally,</i>
<i>by the time you are real,</i>

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.644
<i>"most of your hair</i>
<i>has been loved off,</i>

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:16.945
<i>"your eyes dropped out,</i>
<i>and you get loose in the joints.</i>

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.087
<i>"But these things</i>
<i>don't matter at all</i>

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.153
<i>"because you are real.</i>

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:24.423
<i>"You can't be ugly except to people</i>
<i>who don't understand. "</i>

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:33.401
Andy's moving in.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:34.697
Yeah?

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:36.871
Is that a good idea?

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:42.171
Just be happy
about it. Huh?

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:01.852
Come on.

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.260
This is the idea, is
that it's the history of sadness.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:08.796
Here could be your...
This could be your...

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:12.238
You know, you're
gonna need a big CD box.

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:17.307
Four billion years ago,
Earth begins.

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:20.640
And the idea is that sadness
has not yet been created, but...

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:22.973
I'm sorry.

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:25.475
I'm sorry, too.

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.187
Well, that went well.

01:15:42.004 --> 01:15:43.596
Come on, Arthur.

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.282
This is the living room.

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.021
Dining room.

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:07.027
There are my... I have some
boxes. They're my parents.

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:08.822
My mom.

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:10.558
Hal, Georgia, meet Anna.

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:13.123
Anna, Hal, Georgia.

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:14.691
Hi.

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:18.736
- These are the stairs.
- Oh, yeah?

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:20.331
They go up.

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:25.803
I emptied these for you.

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:38.653
I'll get your case.

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:09.487
Are you okay?

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:04.445
I couldn't sleep and I
didn't want to bother you.

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:08.243
I was...

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:12.316
I was nervous

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:15.388
and excited.

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:20.290
I kept thinking, maybe,

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:22.052
I'm not so lost.

01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:29.894
Why were you
crying yesterday?

01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:21.052
You okay?

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:23.215
Yeah.

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:57.722
You look so unhappy.

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:03.521
Well, are you happy?

01:20:04.766 --> 01:20:05.858
Here?

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:13.932
Maybe I'm not
perfect at it.

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:19.203
I don't really know
what I'm doing.

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:23.818
But I wanna be here.

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.953
I don't know, Anna.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:08.296
I don't think this is what
I'm supposed to feel like.

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:17.060
Okay.

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:22.440
I will go back
to New York then.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:52.403
<i>Hal, you don't need to come in</i>
<i>for any more treatments.</i>

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:54.706
Is there something wrong?

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:56.940
It's best
you stay home.

01:21:58.046 --> 01:22:00.207
Hospice can
help you more now.

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:03.351
Any more treatments
would just

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:06.585
cause more pain.

01:22:07.622 --> 01:22:09.351
Yeah, I understand.

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:13.153
I'm sorry. I wish
we could do more.

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:18.728
No, no, you've, you've done
an excellent job, Dr. Long.

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:22.060
And thank you

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.734
for coming to the party.

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:56.694
<i>You always wanted to hold my hand</i>
<i>when you were little.</i>

01:22:57.872 --> 01:23:01.774
I couldn't, you know. I was
afraid it would look funny.

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:06.112
I wanted to be
close, you know,

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:10.314
and my father certainly
was never close with me.

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:15.252
God, I hope
I wasn't like that.

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:19.188
I can barely remember you
from when I was little.

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.623
<i>I guess I was at work.</i>

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:26.292
Look at the hand
of the man in the brushwork.

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:33.440
It's as if you can feel the spirit
of the artist, if he's very good.

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:35.669
And his every gesture.

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:40.945
It's like a sort of
structural entity in...

01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:43.180
I mean that in the...

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.082
Let's go home.

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.984
...largest use
of that word.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:53.586
What about your father? What
will he possibly do without us?

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:55.753
Georgia,
are you leaving?

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:58.196
Yes, Mary.
It's an emergency.

01:23:58.266 --> 01:24:00.131
Oliver's appendix
has ruptured.

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:02.064
Oh, dear.

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:05.166
He's a very composed child.

01:24:10.211 --> 01:24:12.076
You point,
I'll drive.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:20.020
Ah! The infamous left.

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:25.617
And?

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:32.231
Left again. Going in circles. I like it.

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:26.253
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:28.377
Anna?

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:33.490
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:47.797
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:49.765
All right, here.

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:54.107
All right, Arthur, okay.

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:56.649
You're gonna
look after Elliot.

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:58.618
I'll be back in
a couple of days.

01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:01.644
Good luck.

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:02.712
All right.

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:04.348
Okay? Thanks.

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:39.788
He remembers me.

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:16.752
<i>Hey.</i>

01:28:17.392 --> 01:28:18.450
Hey.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:22.528
Look, I'm so sorry,

01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:26.097
<i>but I'm at your front door.</i>
<i>I'm in New York.</i>

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:38.745
<i>I am in Los Angeles.</i>

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:46.282
You're in LA?

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:48.679
<i>You said you were</i>
<i>coming here.</i>

01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:52.521
Yeah. But I didn't leave.

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.426
<i>Fuck. I'm in</i>
<i>your building.</i>

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:06.839
<i>Okay. See the window</i>
<i>near to the radiator?</i>

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:10.572
<i>There is</i>
<i>a hide-a-key behind it.</i>

01:29:22.256 --> 01:29:24.281
Okay, I'm inside.

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:30.121
Well, there's,
like, nothing here.

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:32.724
<i>No.</i>

01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:38.529
<i>This is my kitchen.</i>
<i>It's where I eat.</i>

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:42.139
<i>This is my bathroom.</i>

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:44.838
<i>It's very fancy.</i>

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:50.078
<i>Outside my window</i>
<i>is my neighbor's roof.</i>

01:29:53.488 --> 01:29:55.922
<i>The room at the end</i>
<i>is my bedroom.</i>

01:29:58.025 --> 01:30:00.016
<i>That's my closet.</i>

01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:03.789
<i>Those are my clothes.</i>

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:05.465
<i>My pictures.</i>

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.065
Why do you leave everyone?

01:30:16.844 --> 01:30:18.709
<i>Why did you let me go?</i>

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:29.918
<i>Maybe because</i>
<i>I don't really believe that it's gonna work.</i>

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:33.558
<i>And then I make sure</i>
<i>that it doesn't work.</i>

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:40.661
Isn't Juan's hair
wonderful?

01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:42.929
Thanks.

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:45.134
I use this
great mousse.

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:46.969
Well, it's terrific.

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:49.168
Do you wanna
try something?

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:51.407
Just a little bit?

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:52.468
I don't think so.

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:55.948
Come on. Just try a
little bit. It'll be fun.

01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:57.780
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:30:58.586 --> 01:30:59.951
How do you do it?

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:02.216
Okay. I'm gonna
show you how.

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:29.446
- There.
- Is that it?

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:31.178
How do I look?

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:32.514
Great.

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:40.083
You look great.

01:32:16.297 --> 01:32:17.958
Oliver.

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.596
He's gone.

01:32:49.864 --> 01:32:51.456
<i>Once you make the call,</i>

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:53.329
<i>you have less than</i>
<i>an hour before two men</i>

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.665
<i>come and place</i>
<i>the body into a bag.</i>

01:32:56.537 --> 01:33:00.439
<i>They charge $1,485</i>
<i>for a cremation</i>

01:33:00.508 --> 01:33:02.806
<i>and deliver the remains</i>
<i>in a small, metal container</i>

01:33:02.877 --> 01:33:05.311
<i>the size of a jar</i>
<i>of peanut butter.</i>

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:07.874
<i>You will need to get</i>
<i>a death certificate.</i>

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:11.508
<i>You will need to make copies</i>
<i>and send them to cancel every credit card,</i>

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:16.649
<i>phone account, utility, gym membership,</i>
<i>every insurance policy,</i>

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:19.249
<i>mortgage,</i>
<i>to settle their taxes.</i>

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:22.761
<i>You will have all their mail</i>
<i>forwarded to your address.</i>

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:25.662
<i>You will write</i>
<i>their obituary.</i>

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:29.032
<i>You run it with a photo</i>
<i>in the paper for $2 a word.</i>

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:31.036
<i>You'll wonder if it's right.</i>

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.799
<i>You'll throw a lot</i>
<i>of their stuff away.</i>

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:36.502
<i>You'll bring a lot of</i>
<i>their stuff to your house.</i>

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:40.302
<i>This is the photo my mother kept</i>
<i>in her bedroom.</i>

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:43.782
<i>When I was a kid, I thought</i>
<i>that was my arm giving her daisies.</i>

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:48.815
<i>Now I make a new mistake and I think</i>
<i>it's her arm giving me the daisies, saying,</i>

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:52.154
<i>"Here. Here is</i>
<i>simple and happy.</i>

01:33:52.226 --> 01:33:54.285
<i>"That's what</i>
<i>I meant to give you. "</i>

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:03.326
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:04.998
Arthur.

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:07.331
Hey.

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:12.170
Thank you.

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:17.673
Thanks.

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:20.112
Sure.

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:22.611
Come on.

01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:26.520
It's because I'm gay.

01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:29.024
Isn't it?

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:30.921
What?

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:34.190
You never called
or came to see me.

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:38.195
No.

01:34:41.842 --> 01:34:44.208
No, it's because my father
loved you so much.

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:13.031
Arthur.

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:16.300
Hey.

01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:21.345
Hey, how have you been?
How have you been?

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:27.286
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:32.548
Hey.

01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:37.496
Come in, come in.

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:44.470
The living room.

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:46.899
Dining room.

01:35:58.085 --> 01:35:59.074
Crazy picture.

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:00.142
Yeah.

01:36:01.822 --> 01:36:03.346
- Can I read it?
- Sure.

01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:07.990
"I'm looking for sex

01:36:08.395 --> 01:36:10.863
"with the hope
it turns into

01:36:11.799 --> 01:36:13.391
