PAM: Yam! Yom! Yom!
LANA: Stop. Stop it.

00:03.069 --> 00:05.069
PAM: Yah! Huh! Yum! Yum! Yum!
LANA: Pam!

00:05.071 --> 00:07.438
PAM: Yum-yum-yum!
Yum-yum-yum! Gimme! Gimme!

00:07.440 --> 00:10.508
Yum-yum! Gimme!
LANA: Goddamn it, will you

00:10.510 --> 00:13.349
calm the shit down?!
PAM: Wow.

00:13.469 --> 00:15.469
LANA: Well?!
This isn't good practice.

00:15.471 --> 00:17.938
My baby's not gonna be
a coke addict!

00:17.940 --> 00:19.773
PAM: Wow.
LANA: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:19.775 --> 00:22.910
What would you like to call it?
PAM: Mm, cocaine enthusiast?

00:22.912 --> 00:25.980
CHERLENE: Is it too late
to not have it?

00:25.982 --> 00:29.483
LANA: Yes! For the jillionth
time, I want this baby, so...

00:29.485 --> 00:32.386
MALORY: Well, sure, <i>now.</i>
<i>Wait until you're waist-deep in</i>

00:32.387 --> 00:35.956
<i>dirty diapers, or he's up with</i>
<i>the croup and there's no bourbon</i>

00:35.958 --> 00:38.592
<i>in the house.</i>
<i>(coughs)</i>

00:38.594 --> 00:41.395
<i>Ugh!</i>
<i>Then fast-forward to him</i>

00:41.397 --> 00:44.064
<i>knocking up the au pair,</i>
<i>flunking out of college, and</i>

00:44.066 --> 00:48.402
<i>then singlehandedly bankrupting</i>
<i>your drug cartel!</i>

00:48.404 --> 00:50.504
<i>PAM: Wait-- college?</i>
<i>LANA: Yeah, right?</i>

00:50.506 --> 00:52.940
<i>MALORY: My point is...</i>
<i>CHERLENE: All babies should</i>

00:52.942 --> 00:56.110
<i>be drowned?</i>
<i>(scoffs) Not all</i> babies.

00:56.112 --> 00:59.113
Just baby people.
LANA: Don't you have a...

00:59.115 --> 01:01.081
tractor pull to headline?
CHERLENE: Yes.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.283
MALORY: No!
PAM: Aw...

01:02.285 --> 01:04.218
MALORY: No more of that
bush-league nonsense.

01:04.220 --> 01:08.022
We're getting Cherlene
a record deal.

01:08.024 --> 01:11.258
Sterling can't screw that up.
LANA: Look, I think maybe

01:11.260 --> 01:13.093
Archer's just been trying
too hard.

01:13.095 --> 01:15.129
MALORY: Ha!
LANA: I'm serious. I mean,

01:15.131 --> 01:18.032
as sad as it is, deep down, he
just wants your approval, and

01:18.034 --> 01:20.467
lately you've been putting so
much pressure on him.

01:20.469 --> 01:23.604
MALORY: Well?
How hard is it to sell 2,000

01:23.606 --> 01:27.541
measly pounds of cocaine?!
Or whatever we're down to now,

01:27.543 --> 01:32.846
1,900 and... What?!
Pam! You damn coke fiend!

01:32.848 --> 01:34.848
PAM: Ow! Ow! Ow!
(Cherlene laughing)

01:34.850 --> 01:38.352
LANA: Malory, stop!
MALORY: I mean, did you used

01:38.354 --> 01:40.354
to be a man?
LANA: Pam?

01:40.356 --> 01:42.356
PAM: I don't know. Did you?
LANA: Have you been

01:42.358 --> 01:44.391
stealing coke?
PAM: Wha...? No!

01:44.393 --> 01:46.961
You think, if I had 100 pounds
of coke, I'd be sitting here

01:46.963 --> 01:48.963
playing choo-choo-spoon with
a tranny?

01:48.965 --> 01:51.598
LANA: Oh, for the...!
I'm pregnant!

01:51.600 --> 01:53.634
CHERLENE: It said, baffling
medical science.

01:53.636 --> 01:56.370
Ow! (laughs)
MALORY: Enough! But, Pam,

01:56.372 --> 02:00.007
I swear to God, if I find out
you're lying to me...

02:00.009 --> 02:02.476
PAM: I'm not! About this!
MALORY: Well, then where the

02:02.478 --> 02:05.846
hell did it go?!
ALL: Oh, you were serious?

02:05.848 --> 02:07.848
ARCHER: Yes!
RAY: No! Stop!

02:07.850 --> 02:09.550
ARCHER: Gimme!
RAY: Archer, move your...

02:09.551 --> 02:11.084
ARCHER: Ray!
RAY: Stop it!

02:11.086 --> 02:13.420
ARCHER: Let me do it!
Come on! Just for a minute!

02:13.422 --> 02:15.139
RAY: No!
ARCHER: Goddamn it!

02:15.141 --> 02:17.090
What could go wrong?!
CYRIL: Uh, you could

02:17.092 --> 02:18.609
crash it!
Just like you crashed

02:18.611 --> 02:20.561
the damn space shuttle!
ARCHER (chuckles): Oh, my

02:20.563 --> 02:23.930
God, right?
Remember that?

02:23.932 --> 02:29.236
Ray, you remember?
You got paralyzed? (chuckles)

02:29.238 --> 02:32.239
How do you not remember that?

ARCHER: Oh, my God, Cyril,
for the... We're not just

03:13.497 --> 03:16.467
waltzing into Colombia with
100 pounds of cocaine.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.604
We're sneaking in
under the radar.

03:18.606 --> 03:20.606
RAY: Literally and
figuratively.

03:20.608 --> 03:22.608
CYRIL: I...
ARCHER: Is there a name

03:22.610 --> 03:25.478
for that when it's both?
Like in French or something?

03:25.480 --> 03:27.446
CYRIL: I meant
once we get there!

03:27.448 --> 03:29.782
Your plan is to just ask
around for...?

03:29.784 --> 03:32.118
ARCHER: La Madrina, yes,
the Godmother.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.236
CYRIL: I know what it means.
RAY: I hate I took Latin.

03:34.238 --> 03:36.205
ARCHER: Maybe someday you'll
meet a mummy.

03:36.207 --> 03:38.457
CYRIL: But what do you think
is gonna happen when three

03:38.459 --> 03:40.609
gringos waltz in and start
asking around for the woman

03:40.611 --> 03:43.546
who runs the entire Cali cartel?
ARCHER: Well, again, Cyril,

03:43.548 --> 03:45.548
we won't actually be waltz...
CYRIL: You know what I mean!

03:45.550 --> 03:47.550
ARCHER: I also know what
I'm doing!

03:47.552 --> 03:49.552
RAY: Yeah, showing mommy
who's a big boy.

03:49.554 --> 03:51.587
ARCHER: What?!
(Cyril laughs)

03:51.589 --> 03:53.589
Oh, you want to see who's
a big boy?

03:53.591 --> 03:56.676
(Cyril and Ray scream)
RAY: Archer!

03:56.678 --> 04:01.063
ARCHER: Take it back!
RAY: Cyril, help!

04:01.065 --> 04:04.066
CYRIL: Uh, uh...
Oh.

04:04.068 --> 04:05.685
ARCHER: Ow!

04:05.687 --> 04:09.238
KRIEGER: Ow!
I don't know where Archer is!

04:09.240 --> 04:12.141
MALORY: Then find him,
you bearded buffoon!

04:12.143 --> 04:14.476
Use the... the surveillance
satellite.

04:14.478 --> 04:16.478
KRIEGER: Oh, you were
serious?

04:16.480 --> 04:18.647
MALORY: Wha...?!
CHERLENE: Don't ask her that.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.200
She hates it.
KRIEGER: ISIS had satellites.

04:21.202 --> 04:23.619
The whatever we are, Gang Who
Couldn't Sell Coke Straight,

04:23.621 --> 04:25.654
doesn't even have cable.
MALORY: But what about

04:25.656 --> 04:27.656
all these?
KRIEGER: They're all aimed

04:27.658 --> 04:29.658
inside the house.
MALORY: Well, what the hell

04:29.660 --> 04:31.660
good is that for?!
KRIEGER: Eh, I'm making

04:31.662 --> 04:33.662
about two grand a month
on the Gilfcam.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.798
OTHERS: Ew!
MALORY: The what cam?

04:35.800 --> 04:38.801
WOODHOUSE: "What is your..."
(mumbling)

04:38.803 --> 04:44.774
Hmm.
Dear Gilf Hound 69...

04:44.776 --> 04:47.610
ARCHER: Jesus Christ.
Thanks for the concussion,

04:47.612 --> 04:49.645
dicks.
CYRIL and RAY: Well?

04:49.647 --> 04:52.148
ARCHER: Oh, and just so
you know, that's exactly how

04:52.150 --> 04:54.400
Len Koenecke died.
RAY: Who?

04:54.402 --> 04:57.787
ARCHER: "Who." Typical.
(Cyril and Ray gasp)

04:57.789 --> 05:05.745
(burro brays)
(all gasp)

05:05.747 --> 05:08.748
RAY: Goddamn it, will you
slow the shit down?!

05:08.750 --> 05:11.801
(all yell)
ARCHER: I'm sorry, was there

05:11.803 --> 05:13.836
a question?
(Cyril and Ray groan)

05:13.838 --> 05:16.389
Because nobody made
you two come here.

05:16.391 --> 05:19.725
I didn't put a gun
to your heads.

05:19.727 --> 05:22.511
I mean, not literally
to your heads.

05:22.513 --> 05:27.566
So, if you'll hide your vaginas,
it's time to gather some intel.

05:27.568 --> 05:30.152
RAY: Intel?
No, do not compare what we

05:30.154 --> 05:33.239
do now to intelligence work.
ARCHER: Don't worry, I won't!

05:33.241 --> 05:36.525
Because selling cocaine to
cocaine dealers doesn't really

05:36.527 --> 05:39.495
compare to helping overthrow
democratically elected

05:39.497 --> 05:42.448
governments!
Like the U.S. did in Guatemala,

05:42.450 --> 05:46.202
Chile, Nicaragua, uh...
Oh! Iran?!

05:46.204 --> 05:48.904
Because-- spoiler alert-- those
didn't really work out so great!

05:48.906 --> 05:51.540
But that's okay, because I'm
pinning my hopes for the

05:51.542 --> 05:54.260
future on the next big shipment
of Stinger missiles to that

05:54.262 --> 05:58.180
ragtag bunch of Mujahideen
heroes in Afghanistan!

05:58.182 --> 06:01.917
CYRIL: I... Wow, it seems
like you've actually given this

06:01.919 --> 06:04.303
some thought.
RAY: Plus, I mean, it's not

06:04.305 --> 06:06.255
like we're selling cocaine
to little kids.

06:06.257 --> 06:08.590
CYRIL: And ISIS did do a lot
of bad stuff.

06:08.592 --> 06:10.643
RAY: We blew up an
oil pipeline.

06:10.645 --> 06:13.446
CYRIL: Not to mention a bunch
of people, which, compared to

06:13.448 --> 06:15.815
that, this is kind of a
victimless crime.

06:15.817 --> 06:18.734
If it even is a crime.
I mean, is it?

06:18.736 --> 06:21.287
ARCHER: He said, sucking at
being a lawyer.

06:21.289 --> 06:23.539
CYRIL: I'm actually an
excellent lawyer.

06:23.541 --> 06:25.941
ARCHER: And I'm excellent in
the field, so...

06:25.943 --> 06:28.410
CYRIL: Maybe at ISIS.
But on ISIS missions, you had

06:28.412 --> 06:30.796
big dossiers with all the
information you could

06:30.798 --> 06:33.299
possibly need.
ARCHER: Yeah, but I never

06:33.301 --> 06:36.302
read them.
(crowd gasping)

06:36.304 --> 06:39.472
What's up, <i>pendejos?</i>
<i>(clattering, chairs scuffling)</i>

06:39.474 --> 06:43.642
<i>CYRIL: Ay, mierda.</i>
<i>RAY: Oh, goddamn Latin.</i>

06:43.644 --> 06:46.896
<i>I just feel like such a tourist.</i>

06:50.335 --> 06:53.943
MALORY: Colombia?
What are they doing in Colombia?

06:54.183 --> 06:55.476
KRIEGER: I...
MALORY: And how did you know

06:55.596 --> 06:57.325
where they were?
I thought you couldn't

06:57.424 --> 06:59.112
track them.
KRIEGER: Ray posted a

06:59.232 --> 07:02.615
Snacklesnap.
It's where you take artsy photos

07:02.735 --> 07:04.429
of your food and share it with
people.

07:04.431 --> 07:05.872
PAM: Snacklesnamps is
awesome.

07:05.997 --> 07:08.497
Look, here's some cocaine
puddin; here's some more

07:08.499 --> 07:10.582
cocaine puddin.
Ooh, cocaine puddin.

07:10.584 --> 07:12.885
MALORY: Why would anyone want
a picture of someone else's

07:12.887 --> 07:15.203
food?
KRIEGER: Well, no, they

07:15.205 --> 07:17.205
don't.
PAM: Yeah, everybody hates

07:17.207 --> 07:19.207
it.
CHERLENE: ♪ Mmm,

07:19.209 --> 07:21.477
Snacklesnaaamps...! ♪
MALORY: But why take cocaine

07:21.479 --> 07:24.713
to Colombia?
LANA: I assume as a sample?

07:24.715 --> 07:27.232
To show some cartel boss that
our product is high-quality and

07:27.234 --> 07:30.052
already in the States?
MALORY: Saving them the

07:30.054 --> 07:32.888
transport cost.
But those three waltzing around

07:32.890 --> 07:35.658
Colombia with millions of
dollars of cocaine?!

07:35.660 --> 07:37.993
My God, they could already be
dead!

07:37.995 --> 07:40.529
LANA: Oh, Malory, come on.
This is Archer, okay?

07:40.531 --> 07:42.665
He can take care of himself.
CHERLENE: Yeah, and I doubt

07:42.667 --> 07:44.833
they were actually waltzing.
LANA: I'm sure they're

07:44.835 --> 07:49.738
totally fine.
CYRIL: Archer!

07:49.740 --> 07:54.710
ARCHER: Woooohoohoohoooo!!
(laughter, cheering)

07:54.712 --> 07:57.963

07:57.965 --> 08:00.916
(glass shatters)
(shouting in Spanish)

08:00.918 --> 08:04.937
Man, why bother with coke?
I just made 100,000 pesos for

08:04.939 --> 08:07.723
jumping through a stupid window.
CYRIL: Yeah, that's about

08:07.725 --> 08:09.892
$50.

<i>CYRIL: But what do they...</i>
<i>(creaking)</i>

09:43.904 --> 09:46.688
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Waiting for you.</i>

09:46.690 --> 09:48.991
<i>And to be honest, having second</i>
<i>thoughts about it.</i>

09:48.993 --> 09:52.661
<i>RAY: Serious shit, come on.</i>
<i>(Cyril yelps)</i>

09:52.663 --> 09:55.214
<i>(Cyril screams)</i>
<i>(Archer chuckles)</i>

09:55.216 --> 09:57.299
<i>COMANDANTE: ¡Abre la puerta!</i>
<i>(banging)</i>

09:57.301 --> 09:58.700
<i>(Cyril whimpers)</i>

09:58.702 --> 10:04.389
<i>ARCHER: Okay, Ray...</i>
<i>RAY: Ow.</i>

10:04.391 --> 10:06.308
<i>CYRIL: Who are these</i>
<i>paramilitarios?</i>

10:06.310 --> 10:08.393
<i>ARCHER: Either heroic</i>
<i>vigilantes trying to restore law</i>

10:08.395 --> 10:10.846
<i>and order because the cops can't</i>
<i>or won't...</i>

10:10.848 --> 10:13.065
<i>CYRIL: Well, that doesn't</i>
<i>sound too bad.</i>

10:13.067 --> 10:15.267
<i>ARCHER: ...or right-wing</i>
<i>terrorists with a boner for</i>

10:15.269 --> 10:17.686
<i>kidnapping and murder.</i>
<i>RAY: That does.</i>

10:17.688 --> 10:19.688
<i>ARCHER: Moot point, though,</i>
<i>really, if you're an American</i>

10:19.690 --> 10:21.723
<i>down here selling cocaine.</i>
<i>I can't believe that guy ratted</i>

10:21.725 --> 10:23.725
<i>us out.</i>
<i>CYRIL: Yeah, and after you</i>

10:23.727 --> 10:25.393
<i>made a connection.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Now, really?</i>

10:25.395 --> 10:27.279
<i>CYRIL: Well...</i>
<i>ARCHER: Shut up.</i>

10:27.281 --> 10:29.498
<i>Ray, hug the shadows, get to</i>
<i>the Land Cruiser and be ready.</i>

10:29.500 --> 10:31.750
<i>Don't turn it on.</i>
<i>Do not touch the brake pedal.</i>

10:31.752 --> 10:34.236
<i>Cyril, I'm gonna take out the</i>
<i>guard; you're gonna take the</i>

10:34.238 --> 10:36.404
<i>truck's distributor cap, got it?</i>
<i>CYRIL: Uh...</i>

10:36.406 --> 10:38.874
<i>COMANDANTE: ¡Se fueron!</i>
<i>(gasping, whistle blowing)</i>

10:38.876 --> 10:40.876
<i>(shouting in Spanish)</i>

10:40.878 --> 10:46.465
<i>PARAMILITARIO: Ay. ¿Qué tiene</i>
<i>adentro, hebillas?</i>

10:46.467 --> 10:50.302
<i>ARCHER: Okay, go, go, go, go,</i>
<i>go.</i>

10:50.304 --> 10:53.088
<i>CYRIL: But...</i>
<i>ARCHER: Look, I realize this</i>

10:53.090 --> 10:56.758
<i>is somewhat my fault, Cyril.</i>
<i>We can talk about it later.</i>

10:56.760 --> 10:58.760
<i>(whimpering)</i>

10:58.762 --> 11:03.782
<i>(truck hood opens, man gasps)</i>
<i>(gun clicks)</i>

11:03.784 --> 11:07.769
<i>ARCHER: So, funny story.</i>
<i>(shouting, gunshots)</i>

11:07.771 --> 11:11.456
<i>(shouting in Spanish)</i>
<i>So, hey.</i>

11:11.458 --> 11:14.459
<i>Sorry in advance for this.</i>
<i>(man groaning)</i>

11:14.461 --> 11:19.781
<i>(gunshots continue)</i>
<i>Cyril, did you get it?</i>

11:19.783 --> 11:21.800
<i>CYRIL: Yes!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Then come on!</i>

11:21.802 --> 11:23.802
<i>(Cyril whimpering)</i>

11:23.804 --> 11:28.123
<i>ARCHER: Hit it!</i>
<i>(engine starts)</i>

11:28.125 --> 11:30.142
<i>Cyril!</i>
<i>CYRIL: I'm coming as fast as</i>

11:30.144 --> 11:32.294
<i>I can!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Guys, we really need</i>

11:32.296 --> 11:36.965
<i>to talk about getting "phrasing"</i>
<i>back in the rotation.</i>

11:36.967 --> 11:39.401
<i>(laughter)</i>
<i>Woooohoohoohoooo!!</i>

11:39.403 --> 11:41.403
<i>Hammer down!</i>

11:44.585 --> 11:48.581
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, Ray.</i>
<i>By "hammer," I meant</i>

11:48.695 --> 11:50.946
<i>"accelerator."</i>
<i>RAY: It's floored, and it's</i>

11:50.948 --> 11:53.064
<i>overheating.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Well, then stop, you</i>

11:53.066 --> 11:55.450
<i>idiot.</i>
<i>RAY: I am not the idiot who</i>

11:55.452 --> 11:57.903
<i>packed the engine compartment</i>
<i>full of cocaine.</i>

11:57.905 --> 12:00.488
<i>ARCHER: Oh, right.</i>
<i>Uh, we should get that out.</i>

12:00.490 --> 12:02.574
<i>RAY: Good idea, that will</i>
<i>give us something to do while we</i>

12:02.576 --> 12:05.043
<i>sit here and wait for those guys</i>
<i>to drive up and murder us.</i>

12:05.045 --> 12:07.495
<i>ARCHER: Ray, they're not</i>
<i>driving anywhere without a</i>

12:07.497 --> 12:11.132
<i>distributor cap, so...</i>
<i>(vehicle approaching)</i>

12:11.134 --> 12:14.085
<i>Cyril, may I see the</i>
<i>distributor cap?</i>

12:14.087 --> 12:16.454
<i>(Cyril gulps)</i>
<i>(Archer chuckles)</i>

12:16.456 --> 12:18.673
<i>Whew, man, Cyril, you had me</i>
<i>worried.</i>

12:18.675 --> 12:21.092
<i>CYRIL: I-I did?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Yeah, see, I always</i>

12:21.094 --> 12:24.629
<i>worried I would die without</i>
<i>knowing how it felt to get my</i>

12:24.631 --> 12:29.568
<i>throat slashed and my tongue yanked
out through the gaping hole.</i>

12:29.570 --> 12:34.973
<i>Are we seriously done with</i>
<i>"phrasing"?</i>

12:34.975 --> 12:37.776
<i>I mean, not right then</i>
<i>necessarily, although "tongue"</i>

12:37.778 --> 12:40.645
<i>and "gaping hole" are kind of</i>
<i>begging for it.</i>

12:40.647 --> 12:44.749
<i>(chuckles)</i>
<i>Gaping hole.</i>

12:44.751 --> 12:47.876
<i>Begging for it.</i>
<i>Eh...</i>

12:50.230 --> 12:53.803
COMANDANTE: Drop your weapon!
ARCHER: Drop your weapons.

12:54.045 --> 12:55.486
COMANDANTE: <i>¿Qué?</i>
<i>RAY: Archer!</i>

12:55.606 --> 12:57.632
<i>CYRIL: Are you crazy?</i>
<i>They'll kill us.</i>

12:57.646 --> 12:59.807
<i>ARCHER: Will you shut up?</i>
<i>I know what I'm doing, Cyril.</i>

12:59.809 --> 13:02.876
<i>It's all about machismo.</i>
<i>Last chance!</i>

13:02.878 --> 13:07.815
<i>Okay, uno, dos...</i>
<i>COMANDANTE: ¡No dispare!</i>

13:07.817 --> 13:11.018
<i>¡No dispare!</i>
<i>CYRIL: What in the...</i>

13:11.020 --> 13:13.287
<i>ARCHER: I told you, all about</i>
<i>the machismo.</i>

13:13.289 --> 13:15.656
<i>RAY: Archer?</i>
<i>ARCHER: ¿Quien es más macho?</i>

13:15.658 --> 13:17.691
<i>RAY: Archer?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Sí, Ramon, Archer</i>

13:17.693 --> 13:19.760
<i>es más...</i>
<i>RAY: Archer!</i>

13:19.762 --> 13:21.862
<i>ARCHER: What?!</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

13:21.864 --> 13:24.731
<i>CYRIL: Well, is that the</i>
<i>army?</i>

13:24.733 --> 13:26.834
<i>ARCHER: I don't think so.</i>
<i>One guy's wearing a T-shirt from</i>

13:26.836 --> 13:29.937
<i>a Phi Mu Fun Run.</i>
<i>RAY: We called them Phi Moo.</i>

13:29.939 --> 13:32.139
<i>CYRIL: Well, then who the</i>
<i>hell is it?</i>

13:32.141 --> 13:35.242
<i>LA MADRINA: Soy La Madrina.</i>
<i>And I think you have been</i>

13:35.244 --> 13:39.196
<i>looking for me, no?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Only my whole life.</i>

13:39.198 --> 13:41.248
<i>RAY: Goddamn it.</i>
<i>LA MADRINA: ¡Oye, tanto!</i>

13:41.250 --> 13:43.200
<i>¿Qué miras?!</i>
<i>COMANDANTE: ¡Vámonos!</i>

13:43.202 --> 13:45.619
<i>¡Vámonos!</i>
<i>LA MADRINA: And you, guapo,</i>

13:45.621 --> 13:48.038
<i>you follow me.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Oh, yeah, uh, about</i>

13:48.040 --> 13:52.826
<i>that...</i>
<i>CYRIL: So, I have a question.</i>

13:52.828 --> 13:56.163
<i>Since we're now essentially</i>
<i>captives of the Cali cartel,</i>

13:56.165 --> 13:59.299
<i>and being dragged off to God</i>
<i>knows what terrible fate...</i>

13:59.301 --> 14:02.886
<i>Why the hell are you smiling?!</i>
<i>ARCHER: A-- we're not their</i>

14:02.888 --> 14:05.355
<i>captives; we're about to be</i>
<i>their business partners.</i>

14:05.357 --> 14:08.175
<i>B-- I bet there's a pretty</i>
<i>decent chance La Madrina owns</i>

14:08.177 --> 14:11.195
<i>a tiger.</i>
<i>And C-- "guapo"</i> means

14:11.197 --> 14:13.346
"handsome."
(Cyril and Ray sigh)

14:13.348 --> 14:16.683
(ringtone playing)
RAY: It's your mother.

14:16.685 --> 14:18.685
ARCHER: Wha...?
Give me that.

14:18.687 --> 14:20.687
MALORY: "Putting pressure
on him."

14:20.689 --> 14:23.240
If anything, I've been too lax,
but please, let me benefit from

14:23.242 --> 14:25.242
your vast experience as
a mother and...

14:25.244 --> 14:26.860
RAY: Hey!
MALORY: Hello, Ray?

14:26.862 --> 14:28.361
Put Sterling on the...
RAY: Hey, damn it, Archer!

14:28.363 --> 14:30.030
Give it h...
ARCHER: Give... Ray, give

14:30.032 --> 14:31.698
it... Ray, give it.
RAY: I'm serious.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.167
I'm serious, Archer,
cut it out.

14:33.169 --> 14:35.035
ARCHER: Damn it, give it
here.

14:35.037 --> 14:37.004
(tires screech and guns fire)
MALORY (gasps): Sterling?

14:37.006 --> 14:39.256
(beep)
OPERATOR: The mailbox of...

14:39.258 --> 14:42.226
(Archer laughing)
...is full.

14:42.228 --> 14:45.879
Good-bye.
(Malory groans)

14:45.881 --> 14:48.098
OPERATOR: If you're satisfied
with your voice mail greeting,

14:48.100 --> 14:50.901
press one.
(Archer chuckles)

14:50.903 --> 14:52.903
RAY: How did you...?
ARCHER: You remember that day

14:52.905 --> 14:54.905
I took your falafel, and you
were chasing me all around the

14:54.907 --> 14:57.157
living room in your wheelchair?
RAY: Yes.

14:57.159 --> 14:59.893
ARCHER: Yeah, so I recorded
that, added some sound effects,

14:59.895 --> 15:02.829
mixed it, called my phone and
left it as a message, stole your

15:02.831 --> 15:06.416
phone, got into the voice mail
settings, called your phone from

15:06.418 --> 15:09.169
a landline and played the
message from my phone, then put

15:09.171 --> 15:12.072
your phone back.
Which I think is why it sounds

15:12.074 --> 15:14.074
a little compressed, but
whatever.

15:14.076 --> 15:16.076
RAY: The...
ARCHER: Shut up, we're here.

15:16.078 --> 15:20.264
And remember, I got dibs on the
tiger.

15:20.266 --> 15:25.352
LA MADRINA: Well, I have to
admit, Mr. Archer, your proposal

15:25.354 --> 15:28.305
is very... surprising.
ARCHER: Not as surprising as

15:28.307 --> 15:31.441
somebody named The Godmother
looking like you.

15:31.443 --> 15:34.094
(La Madrina laughs)
LA MADRINA: Really.

15:34.096 --> 15:36.947
And what were you expecting?
ARCHER: I guess like a

15:36.949 --> 15:39.933
Mexican Mrs. Garrett?
LA MADRINA: <i>¿Qué?</i>

15:39.935 --> 15:41.935
<i>ARCHER: Or Colombian, or</i>
<i>whatever, I...</i>

15:41.937 --> 15:43.870
<i>(La Madrina shushes)</i>
<i>LA MADRINA: You talk almost</i>

15:43.872 --> 15:45.956
<i>too much.</i>
<i>But you have aroused my</i>

15:45.958 --> 15:49.793
<i>curiosity.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Just your curiosity?</i>

15:49.795 --> 15:52.946
<i>(La Madrina chuckles)</i>
<i>LA MADRINA: No.</i>

15:52.948 --> 15:55.749
<i>(Archer coughing)</i>
<i>But first, business, then</i>

15:55.751 --> 15:59.753
<i>pleasure, eh?</i>
<i>(Archer coughing)</i>

15:59.755 --> 16:02.256
<i>ARCHER: Wha...</i>
<i>LA MADRINA: Javier!</i>

16:02.258 --> 16:04.258
<i>JAVIER: Sí,</i> Madrina.
LA MADRINA: <i>Pruébalo, por</i>

16:04.260 --> 16:07.761
<i>favor.</i>
<i>If it is as pure as you say,</i>

16:07.763 --> 16:10.180
<i>and you have as much</i>
<i>as you say...</i>

16:10.182 --> 16:13.267
<i>ARCHER: Oh, my God, we've</i>
<i>got something like 900,000</i>

16:13.269 --> 16:15.468
<i>kilos.</i>
<i>LA MADRINA: Eh, ¿cuanto?</i>

16:15.470 --> 16:18.071
<i>ARCHER: Wait, no, that's</i>
<i>grams, so...</i>

16:18.073 --> 16:21.358
<i>LA MADRINA: So, 900 kilos.</i>
<i>ARCHER: I... however many are</i>

16:21.360 --> 16:23.910
<i>in a shit-ton.</i>
<i>JAVIER: Permiso,</i> Madrina.

16:23.912 --> 16:27.030
Noventa y seis por ciento puro.
LA MADRINA: <i>¡Vaya!</i>

16:27.032 --> 16:32.419
<i>A toast, then, to new friends.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Just friends?</i>

16:32.421 --> 16:36.506
<i>LA MADRINA: No.</i>
<i>(Archer coughing)</i>

16:36.508 --> 16:41.795
<i>So, shall we have sex?</i>
<i>(Archer coughing)</i>

16:41.797 --> 16:52.889
<i>CYRIL: Oh, man...</i>
<i>How is it noon?</i>

16:52.891 --> 16:55.809
<i>And where the heck is Archer?</i>
<i>RAY: I assume bothering a</i>

16:55.811 --> 16:59.479
<i>tiger.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Oh, God.</i>

16:59.481 --> 17:02.949
<i>Please, no más.</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

17:02.951 --> 17:05.819
<i>LA MADRINA: Oh, are you sure?</i>
<i>ARCHER: I was sure, like,</i>

17:05.820 --> 17:07.820
<i>three hours ago.</i>
<i>And back then, I could still</i>

17:07.823 --> 17:10.123
<i>feel my legs.</i>
<i>LA MADRINA: Are you sure you</i>

17:10.125 --> 17:13.076
<i>cannot make love to me just once</i>
<i>more?</i>

17:13.078 --> 17:15.295
<i>ARCHER: Not without a blood</i>
<i>transfusion, no.</i>

17:15.297 --> 17:17.497
<i>(La Madrina sighs)</i>
<i>LA MADRINA: Very well.</i>

17:17.499 --> 17:20.367
<i>ARCHER: Ow!</i>
<i>RAY: Which is why you don't</i>

17:20.368 --> 17:22.368
<i>bother tigers.</i>
<i>LA MADRINA: Then you may call</i>

17:22.371 --> 17:26.807
<i>me Coronel</i> Ana Maria Delgado

<i>(whistles)</i>
<i>ARCHER: Wait, no!</i>

17:34.266 --> 17:36.516
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>
<i>RAY: At least let me take</i>

17:36.518 --> 17:41.988
<i>some churros!</i>
<i>LA MADRINA: Malditos gringos.</i>

17:41.990 --> 17:45.225
<i>As if American demand for</i>
<i>cocaína</i> wasn't already

17:45.227 --> 17:49.863
destroying us, now you even try
to smuggle it <i>into</i> my country?

17:49.865 --> 17:52.282
You make me sick!
ARCHER: Then why'd you have

17:52.284 --> 17:54.401
sex with me?
LA MADRINA: <i>Por qué?</i>

17:54.403 --> 17:58.405

<i>A La Culebra!</i>

<i>(Malory mumbling)</i>
<i>LANA: So, I get that you're</i>

<i>ARCHER: And I didn't even</i>

18:28.270 --> 18:32.456
<i>If she even had a tiger.</i>
<i>Plus, at this rate, we're gonna</i>

<i>run out of coke, huh?</i>
<i>RAY: Now, there's a moot</i>

<i>point.</i>
<i>CYRIL: Since we're being</i>

<i>America.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Pff, notorious.</i>

<i>Cyril, please, I was in the</i>
