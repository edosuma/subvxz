WEBVTT

05:10.310 --> 05:11.550
Go inside.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.682
Hurry up. Go on.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.893
This way.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.817
Go on.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.023
Hurry up.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.669
Ah. Yeah, this'll do.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.247
- Which one are you gonna have?
- Oh, I -

05:42.342 --> 05:43.627
no, that's mine.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.004
Allez-up!

06:26.011 --> 06:28.297
Over 200 feet.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.049
Yeah, I'd say 300.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.005
Long ways to dig.

06:32.559 --> 06:36.143
We'll get cavendish to make a survey.
I wish big x were here.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.596
Willie, you think x got away?

06:39.691 --> 06:41.807
He'd have sent us word somehow if he had.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.688
Gestapo, you think?

06:43.778 --> 06:45.359
Either that or he's dead.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.795
- Group captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.543
I am hauptfeldwebel strachwitz.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.090
Will you accompany me, please?

07:08.178 --> 07:10.214
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.641
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.602
Good morning, group captain.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.280
I'm captain posen, Von luger's adjutant.

07:32.035 --> 07:35.277
Since you're senior British officer,
you are to be liaison

07:35.372 --> 07:37.829
between the prisoners and the colonel.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.499
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of, uh...

07:42.128 --> 07:44.289
The word is "policy"?

07:44.381 --> 07:45.666
Yes.

07:45.757 --> 07:46.917
Thank you.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.966
Come in.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.096
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.941
I am colonel Von luger. Please sit down.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.412
Group captain Ramsey,
in the past four years,

08:19.499 --> 08:22.787
the reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

08:22.877 --> 08:24.788
energy, manpower and equipment

08:24.879 --> 08:27.871
hunting down
escaping prisoner-of-war officers.

08:27.966 --> 08:31.083
Hmm. Well, at least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

08:32.095 --> 08:34.131
For us, it's not a matter for levity.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.006
There will be no escapes from this camp.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.433
Colonel Von luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.136
If they can't,
it is their sworn duty to cause the enemy

08:44.232 --> 08:46.974
to use an inordinate number of troops
to guard them

08:47.068 --> 08:50.856
and their sworn duty to harass the enemy
to the best of their ability.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.403
Yes, I know.

08:53.158 --> 08:56.195
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.953
This man, Ashley-pitt, for example.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.498
Caught in the north sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

09:04.461 --> 09:08.079
Archibald "Archie" ives:
11 escape attempts.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.664
He even tried to jump out of the truck
coming here.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.090
Dickes, William.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.133
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.681
Flight lieutenant velinski: Four escapes.
MacDonald: Nine.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.977
Hendley, the American: Five.
Haynes: Four. Sedgwick: Seven.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.804
The list is almost endless.

09:26.649 --> 09:30.483
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.652
Group captain, this is close to insanity.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.945
Quite.

09:34.616 --> 09:35.696
And it must stop!

09:35.784 --> 09:38.901
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

09:42.707 --> 09:43.742
No.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.327
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.338
This is a new camp.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.918
It has been built to hold you
and your men.

09:56.721 --> 10:00.179
It is organized to incorporate
all we have learned of security measures.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.510
And in me, you will not be dealing
with a common jailer...

10:05.855 --> 10:09.018
But with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

10:09.109 --> 10:10.849
by the luftwaffe high command.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.522
We have in effect put all our rotten eggs
in one basket,

10:17.367 --> 10:20.359
and we intend to watch this basket
carefully.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.572
Very wise.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.250
You will not be denied
the usual facilities:

10:30.213 --> 10:34.297
Sports, a library, a recreation hall.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.922
And for gardening, we will give you tools.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.547
We trust you to use them for gardening.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.677
Devote your energies to these things.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.726
Give up your hopeless attempts to escape.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.684
And, with intelligent cooperation,

10:51.526 --> 10:53.357
we may all sit out the war...

10:55.572 --> 10:57.608
As comfortably as possible.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.671
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

11:18.761 --> 11:22.128
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was kidding. I wasn't stealing tools.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.635
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.263
Of course. Why do you come to Germany?

11:28.104 --> 11:31.642
- Why fight for england, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

11:31.733 --> 11:34.395
In 1812, they burned your capital.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.297
- That's propaganda.
- It's in the history books.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.232
- It's pure propaganda.
- I read it.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.899
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.403
Yeah, no tools.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.162
Hey, Virgil.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.493
Hey, did you see the cooler?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.999
Boy, is it ever a big one.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.331
I think they expect a lot of business.
Yeah.

11:58.426 --> 12:02.135
Hey, those two guys who were with us
in the old camp, in hut 14 -

12:02.222 --> 12:04.884
I can't find 'em. You think the goons
left 'em behind or something?

12:04.974 --> 12:07.135
- I guess.
- Yeah. Hey, what were their names?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.138
It was Jackson and, uh...

12:09.646 --> 12:12.308
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.014
Hey, I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.670
Hey, Danny, who are they?

12:42.387 --> 12:45.299
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.348
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.893
Willie, cigarettes.

13:13.334 --> 13:17.043
Danny and I have a blitz in mind. Could
you put on a brief show for the goons?

13:17.130 --> 13:20.167
- Sure, man. What'll it be? An all-out go?
- Mad prisoner?

13:20.258 --> 13:22.715
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles, eh?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.009
- Yeah, knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.344
What are you doing with my coat, mate?
“What? It's mine!

13:30.435 --> 13:34.769
- Are you pushing me, you Canadian?
- That's mine, you aussie son of a...

13:36.607 --> 13:37.938
Hey, that's mine!

13:39.652 --> 13:41.859
You leave my jacket alone. It's my jacket!

14:00.465 --> 14:04.003
I'll send you back
to the commonwealth!

14:04.677 --> 14:07.589
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

14:07.680 --> 14:09.386
It's all right. It's all right, mate.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.339
We're just
having a friendly little argument.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.096
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.018
- Get back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.265
You too!

14:19.400 --> 14:21.391
Get away! Get back in your huts!

14:24.113 --> 14:25.193
Go on!

14:57.313 --> 14:59.224
Hey, hilts. Hey.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.668
Looks like there's only one other
American in the whole camp:

15:01.692 --> 15:03.899
Some guy named hendley
in the raf eagle squadron.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.773
- Hey, you got something goin' already?
- Shh, shh!

15:06.864 --> 15:08.900
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.820
- Yeah.
- There's a blind spot in the middle.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.533
A blind spot?

15:13.621 --> 15:16.581
A guy could stand at that wire and not
be seen by that tower or that tower.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.658
The one on the end is too far.
They'd never see me, especially at night.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.336
- You're crazy.
- You think so? Let's find out right now.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.601
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

15:43.401 --> 15:46.143
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.814
I think I'll take a little walk.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.989
March!

16:34.535 --> 16:37.242
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- A little, but only one sentence.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.491
Let me have it, mate.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.750
- What's it mean?
- "I love you."

16:49.967 --> 16:52.504
"I love you"? What bloody good is that?

16:52.595 --> 16:54.961
I don't know.
I wasn't going to use it myself.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.069
Halt!

17:19.789 --> 17:21.905
Out. Out!

17:23.960 --> 17:27.248
- Ah, your friend, yes?
- Huh?

17:27.338 --> 17:30.045
And who vouches for you,
lieutenant velinski?

17:30.841 --> 17:32.331
Get out, Sedgwick.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.128
Hold it, hold it!

18:15.803 --> 18:17.759
- Your name?
- Ives.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.511
Ives.

18:20.558 --> 18:23.800
Ives. Oh, yes. Archibald ives. Scots.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.894
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

18:26.981 --> 18:30.144
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.375
I will not take action against you now.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.466
On both sides.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.745
Hey! Get out!

19:27.500 --> 19:29.786
Don't shoot!

19:33.506 --> 19:36.043
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

19:36.133 --> 19:38.920
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

19:39.011 --> 19:40.046
On.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.844
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

19:42.932 --> 19:46.595
Yeah, but my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

19:46.686 --> 19:49.428
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, okay.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.601
Gettin' my baseball.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.434
Stop this nonsense!
Get over the wire immediately!

19:55.528 --> 19:57.109
- Okay.
- You stay there!

19:57.697 --> 19:59.688
Out of the way. Out.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.695
What are you doing over here by the wire?

20:06.789 --> 20:09.496
Like I told Max, I was trying to get -

20:21.095 --> 20:24.462
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...

20:25.224 --> 20:28.432
I was trying to cut my way through
your wire because I wanna get out.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.732
- Do you speak German?
- Jawohl, herr oberst.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.687
- Wire cutters.
- Jawohl, herr oberst.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.864
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite
a number of British officers in this war,

20:47.955 --> 20:49.995
and I flatter myself
that we understand one another.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.547
You are the first American officer
I have met. Hilts, isn't it?

21:00.634 --> 21:02.590
Captain hilts, actually.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.634
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen, sir.

21:04.722 --> 21:07.885
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

21:07.975 --> 21:11.308
I suppose what's called
in the American army a hotshot pilot.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.395
Mm-hmm.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.892
Unfortunately, you were shot down anyway,

21:14.982 --> 21:17.769
so we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.771
Well, you speak for yourself, colonel.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.531
You have other plans?

21:25.618 --> 21:28.155
I haven't seen Berlin yet
from the ground or from the air,

21:28.245 --> 21:31.112
and I plan on doing both
before the war is over.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.414
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

21:34.418 --> 21:36.204
Mmm, about 99 percent.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.039
Then perhaps while you are with us,
you will have a chance to learn some.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.839
Ten days' isolation, hilts.

21:43.886 --> 21:46.093
- Captain hilts.
- Twenty days.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.920
Right.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.553
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.263
Cooler.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.566
- Name?
- Ives.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.489
Flying officer ives.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.567
Cooler. Twenty days.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.331
- Cooler, lves.
- Pleasure.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.260
Hilts. Yeah?

23:56.352 --> 23:59.059
What did you do in the states?
Play baseball?

23:59.813 --> 24:01.269
No, I was in college.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.265
- Say, ives.
- Aye?

24:04.902 --> 24:08.986
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Oh, four over, seven under.

24:11.158 --> 24:14.366
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.827
How tall are you, ives?

24:18.749 --> 24:20.410
5'4". Why?

24:21.543 --> 24:23.204
Oh, just wondering.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.377
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

24:28.926 --> 24:31.338
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.012
Bicycles?

24:33.097 --> 24:35.509
Motorcycles.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.806
You know, flat tracks, county fairs.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.225
Picked up a buck here and there.
Helped pay my tuition.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.061
Oh, I did a wee bit of racing myself.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.854
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

24:45.651 --> 24:48.438
No, horse racing. Jockey.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.649
Jockey?

24:55.577 --> 24:56.577
Jockey.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.410
Hilts?

25:03.961 --> 25:05.417
Are you there, hilts?

25:08.132 --> 25:09.338
Yeah, I'm here.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.791
Don't you have them in the states,
jockeys?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.012
Sure.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.212
They were the days.

25:16.306 --> 25:20.424
Saturday nights in towns like
musselburgh and Hamilton.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.801
You had to fight off the birds.

25:23.689 --> 25:24.929
You know, birds.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.644
Girls, man. Girls.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.688
Do you not have them in the states?

25:33.157 --> 25:34.272
Hilts?

25:35.325 --> 25:36.861
Are you there, hilts?

25:38.537 --> 25:39.617
Ives.

25:42.458 --> 25:43.664
What?

25:44.752 --> 25:47.744
You know the kind of Clay and gravel
we've got here in the compound?

25:47.838 --> 25:49.294
Aye.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.293
How many feet do you think you could
get through in, say, eight hours?

25:53.052 --> 25:56.886
I could cut through this dirt
here like the bit on an end of an auger.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.798
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood

26:00.893 --> 26:02.758
and getting the dirt out.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.389
That's what you have to worry about.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.392
No, it isn't, ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.815
But how are you going to get the dirt out?

26:10.694 --> 26:13.902
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.365
Aye.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.239
Well, what do you think, Navy?

26:22.414 --> 26:24.996
I must say,
it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.200
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

26:27.294 --> 26:30.582
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

26:47.856 --> 26:48.891
Eric.

26:50.651 --> 26:53.484
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.604
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.074
He has arrived.

27:08.919 --> 27:12.582
The prisoner bartlett is discharged
into your custody, colonel Von luger.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.469
I suggest
this prisoner bartlett to be kept

27:25.561 --> 27:28.052
under the strictest security confinement
permanently.

27:29.690 --> 27:32.727
- Make a note of herr kuhn's suggestion.
- Jawohl, herr oberst.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.355
We have reason to believe
that this person is the leader

27:35.445 --> 27:37.561
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.942
Squadron leader bartlett
has been three months in your care,

27:43.620 --> 27:47.158
and the gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

27:47.249 --> 27:51.242
If he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

27:51.336 --> 27:56.000
Air force officer prisoners
are the responsibility of the luftwaffe,

27:56.091 --> 27:57.797
not the ss.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.460
Or the gestapo.

28:02.264 --> 28:04.505
At present, yes, herr oberst.

28:04.600 --> 28:08.388
That is why he is returned
for the moment to your care.

28:08.478 --> 28:11.140
Of course,
if the luftwaffe is not up to the task,

28:11.231 --> 28:14.223
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

28:14.318 --> 28:17.151
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.111
Squadron leader bartlett...

28:25.662 --> 28:30.031
If you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

28:32.002 --> 28:33.367
- Hell Hitler.
- Hell Hitler.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.577
Hell Hitler.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.002
Hell Hitler.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.050
Herr kuhn.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.678
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.351
They dumped you here too.
Yes. What's this one like?

29:33.438 --> 29:35.303
Well, it's new.

29:36.108 --> 29:39.225
Here. Let's find you a bed.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.434
Thanks.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.243
Come in.

30:01.091 --> 30:02.922
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.834
I'll put your bag in your room.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.844
Thanks, Eric.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.673
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

30:10.767 --> 30:14.305
The fellows wanted to put up
a welcome committee, but that's for later.

30:14.396 --> 30:18.014
- Yes, I saw Willie and velinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

30:19.109 --> 30:21.896
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.729
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.402
Have you met the commandant?

30:28.660 --> 30:30.025
Yes, I did.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.870
What were the gestapo
and the ss doing with you?

30:33.957 --> 30:36.699
Oh, they wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.909
- Who else is here? Cavendish?
- Mm-hmm.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.916
- Nimmo and sorren?
- Griffith, haynes.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.497
- Blythe?
- Yes.

30:44.634 --> 30:47.091
Almost the whole x organization.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.259
Almost.

30:49.473 --> 30:52.260
They cleaned out all the other camps
and dumped us in this one.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.593
As Von luger put it,
"all the rotten eggs in one basket."

30:56.855 --> 31:00.188
There's madness in their method.
What about Tommy Bristol?

31:01.693 --> 31:03.979
No, but there's an American, hendley.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.563
Is he a scrounger? Blackmailer?

31:08.200 --> 31:10.691
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

31:12.621 --> 31:15.829
Last of the tea
until the red cross gets through again.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.827
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.296
Did the gestapo give you a rough time?

31:26.510 --> 31:29.297
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

31:30.305 --> 31:34.514
Roger, personal revenge must be
kept out of what we have to do here.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.051
Too many lives are at stake.

31:39.231 --> 31:43.645
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.569
You appointed me big x, and it's my duty

31:47.656 --> 31:50.648
to harass, confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.905
- That's true.
- And that's what I intend to do.

31:55.789 --> 31:59.657
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this third reich of theirs

31:59.751 --> 32:02.333
that thousands of troops
that could be employed to the front

32:02.421 --> 32:04.127
will be tied up here looking after us.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.454
How?

32:05.549 --> 32:07.631
By putting more men out of this...

32:08.718 --> 32:11.585
Perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.843
Oh, not blitzing out two or three
or a dozen, but 200, 300.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.673
Scatter them all over Germany.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.122
- Do you think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

32:19.146 --> 32:22.354
The goons have put every escape artist
in this camp. You said so yourself.

32:23.984 --> 32:26.521
Have you thought of what it might cost?

32:28.989 --> 32:32.732
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

32:33.535 --> 32:35.196
knuckle under and crawl.

32:35.996 --> 32:37.987
Surely you don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

32:39.166 --> 32:41.999
I have to point out one thing to you,
Roger.

32:42.085 --> 32:45.122
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

32:45.213 --> 32:48.376
the high command have still left us
in the hands of the luftwaffe,

32:48.467 --> 32:50.298
not the gestapo and the ss.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.969
Look, sir, you, uh - you talk about

32:55.056 --> 32:58.219
the high command and the luftwaffe,
then about the ss and the gestapo.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.268
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.225
There's only one way to put it, sir.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.433
They are the common enemies
of everyone who believes in freedom.

33:08.111 --> 33:11.194
If the high command didn't approve
of Hitler, why didn't they throw him out?

33:11.281 --> 33:13.021
I have no argument with you, Roger.

33:14.034 --> 33:17.743
As senior officer,
I'm merely pointing out a pertinent fact.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.741
When are you calling a meeting, x?

33:32.052 --> 33:33.167
Tonight.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.513
Gentlemen,

33:46.608 --> 33:50.817
no doubt you've heard the immortal words
of our new commandant:

33:51.530 --> 33:53.862
"Devote your energies to things
other than escape

33:53.949 --> 33:56.907
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible."

33:56.993 --> 33:58.824
Hal

33:58.912 --> 34:01.244
well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

34:02.123 --> 34:05.365
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

34:05.460 --> 34:08.327
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.786
In fact,
we're going to put the goons to sleep.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.962
Meanwhile, we dig.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.630
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound

34:19.724 --> 34:22.887
shows us that huts 104 and 105
are closest to the woods.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.389
The first tunnel goes out from 105

34:25.480 --> 34:28.516
directly east under the vorlager,
the cooler and the wire.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.768
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.818
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.860
I make it just over 335 feet.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.780
Let me know when you've got an exact one.

34:37.867 --> 34:41.655
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.328
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.454
All right, Roger.
But did you say the first tunnel?

34:48.545 --> 34:51.252
I did. There'll be three.

34:53.049 --> 34:57.213
We'll call them Tom, dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104,

34:57.304 --> 34:59.295
dick goes north from the kitchen,

34:59.389 --> 35:02.176
and Harry goes out parallel to Tom
from 105.

35:03.893 --> 35:07.010
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.146
How many men do you plan to take out,
Roger?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.933
Two hundred and fifty.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.965
There'll be no half measures this time,
gentlemen.

35:15.989 --> 35:18.605
There'll be identification papers
and documents for everyone.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.783
And, griff,
we'll need outfits for the lot.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.703
- Two hundred and fifty?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.325
Yes, but, uh...

35:28.209 --> 35:29.665
Okay, Roger.

35:29.753 --> 35:34.463
Mac, maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers,

35:34.549 --> 35:36.130
and timetables for every train.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.173
Right, Roger.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.217
Sorry I'm late, Roger.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.016
It's all right, Colin. Sit down.
We're going to tunnel.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.596
Splendid.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.795
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.435
I'll work out the exact location
with you tomorrow.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.647
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.607
Nimmo and haynes, diversions.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.988
Mac, of course,
will take care of intelligence.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.326
Hendley. We haven't met.

36:08.416 --> 36:09.872
- Scrounger?
- Right.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.790
Dennis, maps and surveys.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.836
Colin, you'll take your usual job.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.611
Eric, have you thought
how you're gonna get rid of this dirt?

36:18.635 --> 36:21.001
Yes, I have. Usual places.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.508
Hadn't anticipated three tunnels,
but we'll manage.

36:23.598 --> 36:26.931
Roger, who's gonna handle security
for all this?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.133
You are.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.228
I want a system of stooges covering
this compound from front to back,

36:32.315 --> 36:35.182
checking every goon in and out.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.892
I want a signal system so perfect

36:37.987 --> 36:41.133
that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet
of any of the huts in which we're working,

36:41.157 --> 36:43.113
we can shut down without a sign.

36:45.704 --> 36:49.117
Well, I don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.289
I'll meet each of you
on the exercise circuit,

36:51.376 --> 36:53.708
and we'll pound out the details.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.038
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

36:58.800 --> 37:00.540
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.825
Oh, hello.

37:28.872 --> 37:30.453
My name's blythe.

37:31.833 --> 37:32.833
Hendley.

37:37.338 --> 37:40.626
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.833
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.962
Oh, a bird-watcher?

37:47.056 --> 37:50.765
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and, uh, drawing them.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.820
I suppose you have bird-watchers
in the states?

37:55.899 --> 37:58.356
Yes, we have some.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.024
Tea?

38:02.155 --> 38:04.646
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.529
Where's your kit?

38:08.620 --> 38:12.158
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

38:13.541 --> 38:17.659
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.964
Such as.

38:23.051 --> 38:26.760
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

38:27.597 --> 38:29.303
I'll need a camera.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.265
- What kind?
- A good one.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.890
A 35-millimeter f/2.8

38:35.980 --> 38:38.596
with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.693
- All right.
- And film, of course.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.980
Oh, of course.

38:47.075 --> 38:50.693
Oh, hendley. I need a pick.
Big, heavy one.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.823
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.622
I'm afraid this tea is pathetic.

39:00.421 --> 39:03.584
I must have used these wretched leaves
about 20 times.

39:04.634 --> 39:06.499
It's not that I mind so much.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.594
Tea without milk is so uncivilized.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.720
Yeah.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.216
I'll get our wood.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.857
Close up! Close up!

39:31.995 --> 39:33.075
Close up!

39:35.665 --> 39:37.371
Close up! Hmm?

39:37.458 --> 39:39.995
- Close up! Close up!
- No me sprechen sie english.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.201
Close up!

40:05.028 --> 40:06.028
On.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.027
Splendid.

40:21.294 --> 40:22.784
Blythe, what are you doing here?

40:22.879 --> 40:24.835
Hmm? Oh.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.791
I'm in photographic aerial
reconnaissance interpretation.

40:28.885 --> 40:32.719
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.716
The aircraft bought it.

40:34.807 --> 40:37.549
Got shot down. Terrifying.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.843
No, I mean, what do you do here?

40:41.564 --> 40:42.564
Here?

40:43.483 --> 40:46.099
Oh. I'm the forger.

41:06.673 --> 41:09.756
The forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.457
- Sedgwick?
- I'min 110.

41:11.552 --> 41:14.919
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

41:15.014 --> 41:17.380
1097? Right.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.885
I'll work in 107.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.935
For now, Danny and Willie
and their trap team will be in 104.

41:22.021 --> 41:24.262
Mac, I want to take a chance
on the tunnels

41:24.357 --> 41:26.313
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.564
But we will need timber, of course,
for the shafts and the entrance chambers.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.361
Now, hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

41:32.448 --> 41:35.906
We can tear up 15 and move the men back
and forth so the goons won't miss them.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.594
The rest will come from strips
off the wall, as we've always done.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.325
- Is hendley taking care of this himself?
- Not yet.

41:41.416 --> 41:44.453
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

42:02.437 --> 42:05.019
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

42:05.106 --> 42:07.472
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

42:07.567 --> 42:10.525
Get away!

42:11.654 --> 42:14.020
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

42:14.115 --> 42:15.776
Turn the water off!

42:15.867 --> 42:17.482
Stop this nonsense!

42:18.661 --> 42:20.447
Will you turn it off?

42:20.538 --> 42:24.531
Get away, here! Turn the water off!
Somewhere!

42:38.556 --> 42:40.797
Turn the main valve off somewhere.

43:04.874 --> 43:07.957
In the stove, we keep fire burning always.

43:08.044 --> 43:10.160
This way,
the goons will not feel like moving it.

43:10.254 --> 43:11.619
- Good.
- Hendley -

43:12.924 --> 43:15.210
two tiles, they are chipped.
We need new ones.

43:15.927 --> 43:19.419
There's some in 113's washroom.
Should match perfectly.

43:19.514 --> 43:20.549
Good.

43:28.815 --> 43:30.726
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.729
Not when you're organized, Mac.

43:39.492 --> 43:41.733
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

43:41.828 --> 43:45.070
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

43:51.712 --> 43:53.122
Good luck to us, Danny.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.765
Why 177?

44:14.777 --> 44:17.143
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

44:49.604 --> 44:51.094
- All right?
- Lovely.

45:06.537 --> 45:07.697
It's good.

45:17.423 --> 45:18.754
It's very good.

45:19.550 --> 45:20.550
Haynes.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.454
Get out! Get out!

46:16.148 --> 46:18.230
- Come out here!
- Out, out, out!

46:18.317 --> 46:19.727
- Here!
- Out, out, out!

46:22.989 --> 46:24.854
You're not in your hut.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.565
- What are you doing here?
- Mopping up.

46:32.081 --> 46:34.948
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

46:39.130 --> 46:42.167
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

46:46.637 --> 46:49.253
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

47:25.134 --> 47:26.624
Aus'

47:38.314 --> 47:40.305
No, no. I vote no.

47:40.941 --> 47:43.227
Look, we've put the goons to sleep
exactly like you said.

47:43.319 --> 47:45.964
But just one thing like this,
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

47:45.988 --> 47:49.230
“We -
ah. Ives, sit down, won't you?

47:50.159 --> 47:51.615
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.943
- Squadron leader bartlett, captain hilts.
- Hi.

47:54.038 --> 47:56.074
- Flight lieutenant MacDonald.
- Hi

47:56.957 --> 48:00.074
I, uh, understand
you two are contemplating a blitz-out.

48:00.169 --> 48:02.455
Where'd you hear that, sir?

48:02.546 --> 48:05.253
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

48:05.341 --> 48:07.548
- Oh.
- We, um -

48:07.635 --> 48:09.546
we thought perhaps we might talk it over.

48:09.637 --> 48:11.343
Why? It's only a two-man job.

48:12.098 --> 48:15.716
Everybody in the camp is supposed to
clear all escape attempts in advance

48:15.810 --> 48:18.176
with squadron leader bartlett here.

48:18.270 --> 48:21.637
We, uh, don't necessarily
want to interfere. It's just that -

48:22.775 --> 48:25.938
well, what sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

48:26.028 --> 48:30.067
Well, we sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire, a blind spot.

48:30.157 --> 48:32.364
Then we dig down three feet,
take the dirt,

48:32.451 --> 48:35.568
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,
and then - straight out.

48:35.663 --> 48:38.245
Ives here is a tunnel man,
so he digs in front,

48:38.332 --> 48:41.199
pushes the dirt behind him,
and I stash it behind me.

48:41.293 --> 48:43.500
Then we burrow through the dirt
like a couple of moles.

48:43.587 --> 48:46.579
Then by dawn we're under the wire,
across the open space,

48:46.674 --> 48:48.585
into the woods and gone.

48:54.807 --> 48:55.887
Well, uh...

48:58.769 --> 49:01.602
When do you intend to try this?
Hmm?

49:01.689 --> 49:04.055
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

49:04.150 --> 49:06.607
Uh, hilts,

49:06.694 --> 49:09.777
this may not be quite the right time
for this sort of thing.

49:09.864 --> 49:13.152
Look, sir, I've been in the bag
nearly three years now,

49:13.242 --> 49:15.654
bloody close to being wire-happy.

49:15.744 --> 49:17.985
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

49:18.873 --> 49:21.535
It'll work. I know it will.

49:29.675 --> 49:30.790
Good luck.

49:31.427 --> 49:32.542
Thank you.

49:35.181 --> 49:39.470
- Hilts, um, how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it,

49:39.560 --> 49:42.393
and we shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.061
Good night, sir.

49:49.945 --> 49:52.982
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

49:53.073 --> 49:55.530
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

49:56.619 --> 49:59.736
Oh, but it'll bring every goon in the camp
down on top of us.

49:59.830 --> 50:02.287
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

50:02.374 --> 50:04.410
If we stop all the breakouts,

50:04.502 --> 50:07.289
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunneling.

50:08.047 --> 50:10.083
I hope it works.

50:10.174 --> 50:13.587
If it doesn't, those two are gonna be
in the cooler for an awful long time.

50:59.557 --> 51:00.797
Good, huh?

51:00.891 --> 51:02.677
Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

51:08.857 --> 51:12.020
- This is the dirt from the compound.
- This is from the tunnel.

51:19.034 --> 51:21.650
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

51:22.329 --> 51:24.866
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

51:24.957 --> 51:26.948
No, it's the first place
the ferrets would look.

51:27.042 --> 51:29.158
I saw one measuring the height
under a hut yesterday.

51:29.253 --> 51:31.118
Maybe we could dry it out
to the same color.

51:31.213 --> 51:35.752
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

51:35.843 --> 51:38.084
If you must think,
for god's sake, think clearly.

51:40.139 --> 51:42.050
Where the devil is Ashley-pitt?

51:43.809 --> 51:46.471
We can't destroy the dirt,
and we can't eat it.

51:47.354 --> 51:49.811
The only thing left to do
is camouflage it.

51:50.649 --> 51:53.140
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

51:54.320 --> 51:56.777
Didn't they teach you promptness
in the rn?

51:56.864 --> 51:59.230
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

52:00.159 --> 52:04.198
The problem is somehow to get rid of
this tunnel dirt over the compound.

52:04.288 --> 52:05.778
Well, of course.

52:06.999 --> 52:08.409
Would you mind?

52:18.886 --> 52:20.001
Now...

52:22.681 --> 52:25.388
You fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

52:26.060 --> 52:29.644
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

52:29.730 --> 52:31.891
you wander out into the compound,

52:31.982 --> 52:35.566
where you pull these strings
in your pockets.

52:37.112 --> 52:38.602
Out come the pins.

52:42.034 --> 52:43.490
Eric, it's good.

52:43.577 --> 52:46.990
All you have to do is kick it in.

52:47.081 --> 52:49.868
Unless you're a complete fool,
the ferrets will never see a thing.

52:49.958 --> 52:53.166
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger, eh?

52:53.253 --> 52:55.835
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

52:59.176 --> 53:02.009
Mac, this is what we'll do.

53:16.652 --> 53:19.735
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Ah, thank you, nimmo.

53:28.205 --> 53:30.161
- Nice garden you've got, sir.
- Mm.

53:30.249 --> 53:31.489
Carry on.

54:03.282 --> 54:05.068
All right, let's look sharp!

54:12.416 --> 54:13.622
That looks sharp.

54:18.297 --> 54:19.707
Sir.

54:23.218 --> 54:27.177
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

54:42.613 --> 54:45.104
- Good morning, squadron leader.
- Good morning, sir.

54:45.199 --> 54:49.442
I am sorry the soil here
isn't better suited to your men's purpose.

54:49.536 --> 54:51.026
We'll manage, sir.

55:00.923 --> 55:05.257
I must say I am surprised with the extent
of this activity, group captain.

55:05.344 --> 55:08.427
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, colonel?

55:08.514 --> 55:11.256
Fliers are gentlemen,

55:11.350 --> 55:13.591
not peasants to dig in the earth.

55:13.685 --> 55:15.141
So I am surprised.

55:15.229 --> 55:17.641
The english have always been
very keen on gardening.

55:17.731 --> 55:21.269
Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?

55:22.277 --> 55:24.438
You can't eat flowers, colonel.

55:25.739 --> 55:27.775
Good point.

55:45.884 --> 55:49.126
You know, I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

55:49.221 --> 55:52.384
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

55:52.474 --> 55:54.510
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

56:06.780 --> 56:08.896
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

56:08.991 --> 56:11.698
Here we are. Now, let's see.

56:12.494 --> 56:14.280
Biscuits, two packets.

56:15.038 --> 56:16.699
Coffee, two tins.

56:17.374 --> 56:19.035
Bovril, one jar.

56:19.751 --> 56:22.163
Cigarettes, six packets.

56:22.838 --> 56:25.921
Strawberry jam, sorren's.
Blackcurrant jam, cavendish.

56:27.050 --> 56:29.041
And marmalade, mine.

56:29.136 --> 56:32.754
Danish butter, Von luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

56:32.848 --> 56:35.430
Oh, yes. And, uh -

56:35.517 --> 56:38.224
and Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

56:39.479 --> 56:42.812
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organization.

56:42.900 --> 56:46.142
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

56:46.236 --> 56:49.194
The forgers have no idea what
it looks like and can't move without it.

56:49.281 --> 56:50.646
I'll see what I can do.

56:50.741 --> 56:54.279
And, of course, any other identity cards,
personal papers,

56:54.369 --> 56:56.610
documents you can put your hands on.

56:56.705 --> 56:58.241
Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.

56:58.332 --> 56:59.447
- Right.
- Good luck.

57:08.884 --> 57:13.173
& o come, all ye faithful &

57:13.263 --> 57:16.175
j joyful and triumphant j

57:16.266 --> 57:20.134
j o come ye, o come ye &

57:20.228 --> 57:24.062
&' to Bethlehem j

57:24.149 --> 57:27.812
I come and behold him &

57:27.903 --> 57:31.111
j born the king of angels j

57:31.198 --> 57:34.782
I o come, let us adore him j

57:34.868 --> 57:38.156
I o come, let us adore him j

57:38.246 --> 57:43.081
I o come, let us adore him... j

57:43.168 --> 57:45.784
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

57:45.879 --> 57:49.121
- Oh, Patience is a virtue, Roger.
- Yes, I know, dear boy.

57:49.216 --> 57:51.707
But the diggers can only work
when the trap's open,

57:51.802 --> 57:53.963
and this is holding us up very badly.

57:56.181 --> 57:58.263
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

57:58.350 --> 58:01.012
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

58:01.103 --> 58:04.015
- But when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

58:04.773 --> 58:06.183
Does it work?

58:06.274 --> 58:07.559
Of course it works.

58:08.360 --> 58:11.102
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

58:12.114 --> 58:13.114
Mac?

58:13.824 --> 58:14.984
Excellent.

58:16.410 --> 58:17.900
Have it in by tomorrow night.

58:20.372 --> 58:23.705
I Christ the lord &

58:29.965 --> 58:31.546
Got a light?

58:31.633 --> 58:32.748
Oh, yeah.

58:35.512 --> 58:36.547
Thanks.

58:37.305 --> 58:39.216
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

58:47.691 --> 58:50.023
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

58:52.612 --> 58:55.775
I'll smoke it later, when I'm off duty.
Thank you.

58:55.866 --> 58:58.448
You probably have
a couple of roommates, huh?

59:00.162 --> 59:01.618
Beautiful day.

59:01.705 --> 59:04.742
Yes.
But I think it might rain later.

59:04.833 --> 59:06.118
No, no.

59:06.209 --> 59:09.667
Uh, red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

59:09.755 --> 59:11.871
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

59:11.965 --> 59:14.001
It was a red sky last night.

59:14.092 --> 59:16.048
I never heard that before.

59:16.136 --> 59:17.876
I learned it in the boy scouts.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.011
- You were a boy scout?
- Mm-hmm.

59:20.098 --> 59:21.133
- So was I.
- Really?

59:21.224 --> 59:24.216
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

59:25.270 --> 59:29.058
I was working on my 20th
when the government abolished scouting

59:29.149 --> 59:31.856
and sent me into the Hitler youth instead.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.396
Hey, Werner,

59:37.491 --> 59:39.982
you think you'll stay in the army
after the war?

59:40.077 --> 59:42.910
Oh, no. No. I'm not a well man.

59:42.996 --> 59:44.827
My teeth. Your teeth?

59:44.915 --> 59:48.157
Yes. Ah, I could tell you stories
about my teeth

59:48.251 --> 59:50.207
that would make your hair stand on end.

59:50.295 --> 59:52.001
Our dentist here is a butcher.

59:54.007 --> 59:55.872
But don't tell anyone I said so.

59:57.260 --> 59:59.171
It's a soldier's right to complain.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.969
Maybe in your army, but here?

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:05.803
One little criticism, and - zzzt!

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:07.430
To the Russian front.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:08.931
Is that so?

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:10.731
Terrible.

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:13.353
That's terrible.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:20.317
Werner...

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:26.285
Why don't we go into my room,
where we can talk more comfortably.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:27.988
I'd better not.

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:30.449
If strachwitz should see me - zzzt!

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.873
I was just gonna make some coffee.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.248
Some real coffee.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:09.196
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.740
Where is it?

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.586
Well, my grandmother
keeps sending me this stuff.

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:29.098
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:39.818
Yeah. Keep it.

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:42.772
- Nein. I must go.
- Werner, Werner -

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:45.323
it's okay. You can keep it. We're friends.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:48.618
With you in the cooler, will we
still be friends? I must report this.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.787
I don't understand you, Werner.
Report what?

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.160
That you and I were chatting in my room?

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:56.080
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's okay.

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:57.581
- Look, keep it.
- No! No!

01:01:57.672 --> 01:01:59.942
I'll never be able to eat it all.
I've got all I could eat.

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:02.628
I'm sorry. All right.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.129
Forget it. Forget it.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:40.587
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the nelles warbler.

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:42.756
Now let's turn our attention
to this, gentlemen.

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:45.925
The masked shrike.
Llanius nubicus. The butcher-bird.

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:50.263
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of Thorn bushes.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.511
Not a very lovable character, you see.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.263
Let's have a look at the coloring.

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:57.767
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:00.644
A black rump,
a black crown with a bold white flash,

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:03.101
and a white line over the eye.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.312
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country...

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:10.112
Ah, hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:13.286
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country,

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:15.034
olive groves and gardens.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.707
Well, herr hendley,
have you taken to birds too now?

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.376
Yeah. You should stick around.
You might learn something.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.875
I have better things to do
than draw birds.

01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:28.005
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:32.760
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:56.328
- Permission to cross a frontier.
- Good.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:59.032
Here's another one.
Which one's the forgery?

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:00.287
Uh,

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:02.334
that one.

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:05.164
- That's right.
- They both are.

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:08.834
What's holding us up now
is the new form of this travel permit.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:11.840
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Uh, here's one.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:16.015
And a military identity card.

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:18.601
And a...

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.098
An auswels. Yeah.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.055
Permission to be on reich property.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:24.357
A ticket to oden.

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:28.278
What appears to be the ferret assignments
by day and hour for the next week.

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:31.610
You get ten out of ten for this, old boy.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:35.068
- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:37.449
You - it's on loan.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:42.876
Now, in order to get
the right amount of outfits, Roger,

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:46.420
I suggest that we work mainly
from service uniforms.

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:50.376
Now, I can do
double-breasteds, single-breasteds,

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.382
and, uh, rather nice lounge suits.

01:04:53.473 --> 01:04:56.089
Lapels.
I can do quite a lot of things with those.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:05:00.928
I can have them deep like that
or high ones like that.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:02.137
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:05.349
Here's one that, uh,
we're working on right now.

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:07.149
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:10.483
Just take a look at those.

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.113
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:16.985
And, uh...

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:22.415
Here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.956
Mm, it's rather good.

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.249
What's up, Roger?

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:30.207
The goons would have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:34.465
That's sorren's department. Now, I've
started working on the other materials.

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:36.717
This, uh - this blanket.

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:39.094
Particularly the stripes. Marvelous.

01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:41.304
- Coats.
- Yes.

01:05:41.396 --> 01:05:43.978
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:47.307
Oh, those battle dresses -
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:50.769
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.274
Mm-hmm.

01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:53.730
Blanket ticking.

01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:59.036
Now, I've made these
into rather nice little waistcoats.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.862
Ah, very dapper, yes.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.822
- Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:04.908
Uh, just take a look at this, Roger.

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:07.710
Now, this blanket material,

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:11.039
we scrape this down
until it's really smooth

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.874
and then dye it with boot Polish.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:17.429
Corduroy scrounged by hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:20.473
- Where in god's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.972
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:25.474
What did he say? "Don't ask."

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:28.557
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:06:59.633
- Hilts.
- Good morning, hilts.

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:01.089
Uh-oh.

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:05.640
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.846
- When?
- Seventeen days. Seventh of July.

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.772
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.440
Is ives going with you?

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.814
Yeah, if he wants to.

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:18.527
You, uh - you know that ives
is close to cracking.

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:20.866
Yeah.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:25.100
Figure it's better for him
to go out in the tunnel, huh?

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.284
Safer.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:33.250
Right.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.503
Hilts, it's possible for one man to
get out through the wire, even get away,

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.963
but, um, there are in fact

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:45.516
a considerable number of people
besides yourself in this camp

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:47.218
who are trying to escape.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.221
I appreciate that.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.980
Something's coming, I can feel it,

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.608
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, squadron leader.

01:07:57.699 --> 01:08:00.941
- Uh, my name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:03.401
Yours is, uh, Virgil, isn't it?

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:07.238
Hilts. Just make it hilts.

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:12.911
Yes, well, um, as I was saying, hilts,

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:17.045
um, we have maps of Germany -
general maps, that is.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:19.421
In fact,
we have all the information that we need

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:21.298
for the escape routes out of Germany.

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:23.470
But, um, what we do not have -

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:27.142
is a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:30.185
Right. We've tried every goon
in the camp. No go.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:33.765
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:37.189
We want to know where we hit
the main roads. They must patrol them.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.613
Where the police stations are, where
they've got their military roadblocks.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.531
And most important of all,

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:46.328
we've got to know how to get from here
to the railway station.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:50.453
No. Absolutely not.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.229
When I get through that wire,
I'm not gonna be

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:54.413
peeking over fences,
making maps for you guys.

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:56.245
By morning I'm gonna be so far away,

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:58.781
you couldn't hear it
if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:01.209
- Hmm?
- That's understandable.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:03.215
Completely.

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:07.424
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:12.808
Interesting idea.

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:15.390
How many you taking out?

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:16.975
Two hundred and fifty.

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.188
Two hundred and fifty?

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:23.398
Yeah.

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:26.779
You're crazy.
You oughta be locked up. You too.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:30.238
Two hundred and fifty guys just
walking down the road, just like that.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:34.121
Well, some on the road,
some by train, some cross-country.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:36.624
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:38.578
maps, compasses, rations.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.917
Has it occurred to you that you're gonna
alert every goon in the country?

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.877
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:48.805
They're gonna swoop down and scoop
you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:54.686
Yes, well, uh, thanks anyway.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:57.140
Anything I can do to help on the tunnel,
let me know.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:59.317
- That's very good of you.
- Anytime.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.438
Wait a minute!

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:07.025
You aren't seriously suggesting
that if I get through the wire

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.032
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:13.035
to turn myself in and get thrown back
in the cooler for a couple months

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:15.458
so you can get the information you need?

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.035
Yes.

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:20.247
One has to ask some very strange things
in the job I have.

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.081
We'll give you a front place
in the tunnel.

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:24.446
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.
- I don't blame you.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:27.052
- Well, okay, then.
- Well, it's completely understandable.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.346
Well, okay, then.

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:32.592
Yes, well, thanks, hilts.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:41.730
Check.

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:47.031
Herr hendley, I...

01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:49.279
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.121
What's the matter, Werner?

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:57.666
My wallet, my papers,
my identity card, gone.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:10:59.619
I lost them. Everything.

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:02.838
He lost his wallet. Hmm?

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:05.917
Do you realize what would happen
if strachwitz found this out?

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:08.344
- Zzzt! The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.215
I've looked everyplace, everyplace.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:18.013
I must have lost them while I was in here.

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:20.272
No. Yes.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:24.439
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:27.275
Oh, thank you, herr hendley.

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:30.236
Werner.

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.531
Not now.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.203
It might look a little peculiar

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.997
if you and I were seen
probing around at this time of night.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:38.084
On.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.660
Look, I'll find them.

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:43.747
I promise you I'll find 'em
if I have to tear this room apart.

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:52.301
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.091
Werner... yes?

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:57.051
- There is one small favor.
- Ja?

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.386
A camera.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:04.726
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:10.065
35-millimeter with a 2.8 lens
and a plane shutter.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.740
Focal-plane shutter.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:17.326
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.575
Let me know when you got it.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:29.296
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid, that Werner,
but I like him.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:31.669
Checkmate.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.621
How soon is our air pump
going to be ready?

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:02.166
- Oh, I'll have it for you tomorrow, Roger.
- You're badly behind schedule.

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:04.710
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:07.038
- No good?
- Today, three times -

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.432
Willie, you all right?

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:27.562
Pull!

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:59.636
You're gonna have to shore up
the whole bloody tunnel, Roger.

01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:01.592
All 335 feet of it.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:04.892
Four times today.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:09.146
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:13.313
It's a lot of timber, Roger.
Can you get it?

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:17.650
We'll get it.

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:19.861
We've gotta get it.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:23.573
I'll put hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:26.951
Okay, Willie.

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:30.504

- Say, cavendish -
- &' three French hens, two turtledoves &

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:00.845
j and a partridge in a pear... j
allez-up!

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:09.557
Never mind.

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:22.283
Here's a present from our friend, Werner.

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:26.696
Splendid. Simply splendid.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:30.374
This should do very nicely.

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:35.542
Those are Ashley-pitt's men.

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:39.125
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

01:17:43.868 --> 01:17:44.948
Hmm.

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:52.244
Tom has reached just beyond that, uh,
pile of wood, sir, in the vorlager.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.666
Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:56.664
How much further to the trees?

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:58.791
We make it 50 feet, sir.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:01.169
- Dark of the moon is the seventh -
- Eighth and ninth.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.751
- Eighth and ninth. Mm.
- A day earlier in August.

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:04.846
Yes.

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:11.849
Morning.

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:14.770
There he goes again.

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:18.065
Why is he buying up
all the potatoes in the camp?

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:21.019
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:23.775
Hilts and hendley lock themselves
in their room every night.

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:27.233
Sometimes goff's in there with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:31.287
Mac, we'll close down dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:34.456
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press right on into the trees.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:35.703
Right, Roger.

01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:24.884
Wow.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:28.346
Wow.

01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:31.714
Wow.

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:00.118
Wow.

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:08.376
Wow.

01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:18.343
Wow.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:10.855
About face!

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:13.565
Forward march!

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:22.453
What is it?

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:24.330
They're celebrating the revolution.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.870
It's the fourth of July.

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:38.007
What the devil is this?

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.186
And halt!

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:46.561
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks
at the wash tank.

01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:48.922
It's the fourth of July.
A little present from the colonials.

01:21:48.946 --> 01:21:50.436
- Down the British.
- Hear, hear.

01:21:50.531 --> 01:21:52.897
- Quite right too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:55.232
- And to getting home.
- Thank you.

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:56.908
Very well. We accept.

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.860
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:02.414
Gentlemen, if you'd care to follow us.
About face!

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:04.037
Column, now! March!

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:24.266
- Company, halt!
- Fall out!

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:30.150
All right, let's line up down here!

01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:33.108
All right, grab a cup!

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:36.323
Line it up! Here we go.

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:39.277
All right, keep it moving.
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:45.908
That explains
what happened to the potatoes.

01:22:46.003 --> 01:22:48.836
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:51.834
No, I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

01:22:51.925 --> 01:22:53.540
There's only 14 feet to go, sir,

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.751
and you can feel it
throughout the whole bloody camp.

01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:58.713
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear, sir.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:01.298
- Drink it up.
- What is this stuff, hilts?

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:04.510
Moonshine. American moonshine. Moonshine.

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:08.723
- Make my mustache grow. Cheers.
- Here we go. Keep it moving, now.

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:12.184
Keep it go -
hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.

01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:14.440
- There you go.
- Hello, Eric. Down with the British.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:17.898
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo - whoop!

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:20.234
Yeah. Don't get any on your clothes.

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:22.615
- Cheers!
- Don't get any on your clothes.

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:25.448
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:28.124
- Have you any tonic water?
- Here, keep it moving.

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:30.419
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:33.293
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:36.963
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:47.014
Cheerio!

01:23:51.985 --> 01:23:53.941
Get good and stoned, my friend.

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.606
Keep it going. Keep it...

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:02.367
No taxation without representation.

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:05.120
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:11.994
Well, let's drink to Tom.

01:24:12.089 --> 01:24:13.124
To Tom.

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:19.760
Oi!

01:24:21.014 --> 01:24:22.504
In the three years, seven months

01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:25.386
and approximately two weeks
that I've been in the bag,

01:24:25.477 --> 01:24:27.843
that's the most extraordinary stuff
I've ever tasted.

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:30.478
Oh, it's shattering!

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:32.557
Well, I think it's rather good.

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:38.320
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll "all on kive" -

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:40.898
call on ives.

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:52.709
- Cheers, hendley!
- Hendley!

01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:53.911
Cheers!

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:02.927
You know what that is?

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:05.088
I'll tell you what it isn't.

01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:07.720
It isn't Napoleon Brandy.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.428
How do you like it, sir?

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:14.690
Well, it's, um...

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.607
To the colonies.

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:18.231
Independence.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.902
How are you managing over there
without us?

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:28.533
Getting along all right, are you?

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:31.536
We seem to be getting along all right,
shir - sir.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.671
Yes, well, it's, uh...

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.511
It's good stuff, hilts.

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:49.508
Thank you, sir.

01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:12.280
Danny? Here's to...

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.291
Roger, goons in 105.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.006
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:32.301
We have to ignore it. If we pay attention,
the goons will know the hut's important.

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:35.929
Here's to going home.

01:26:51.164 --> 01:26:54.622
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:55.950
Home.

01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:11.494
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us, piglet.

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:13.224
- Aye.
- To Tom, eh?

01:27:15.856 --> 01:27:19.940
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down
argyle street in a couple of weeks, man.

01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:21.607
To Tom.

01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:24.778
You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realize that myself.

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:27.902
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

01:27:27.993 --> 01:27:29.949
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:19.074
Herr hauptfelawebel! Herr hauplfeldwebel!

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.041
Herr hauptfeldwebel!

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:02.291
Oh, my god, they've found Tom!

01:29:16.226 --> 01:29:17.557
It's the tunnel.

01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:36.943
Success.

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:03.015
- Ives!
- Halt!

01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:05.347
- Ives! Ves!
- Halt! Halt!

01:30:05.442 --> 01:30:06.442
Halt!

01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:14.750
Sir...

01:31:15.887 --> 01:31:17.923
Let me know
the exact information you need.

01:31:18.848 --> 01:31:20.930
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

01:31:23.603 --> 01:31:25.059
Open up Harry.

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:28.267
We dig. Around the clock.

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:07.529
Cooler.

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:09.201
Right.

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:15.120
Well,
I didn't think they'd catch him so soon.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.210
He wasn't caught.

01:33:32.565 --> 01:33:34.476
Hilts, welcome home.

01:34:27.704 --> 01:34:28.704
Danny?

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:32.326
Danny?

01:34:36.004 --> 01:34:37.039
Danny?

01:34:44.596 --> 01:34:46.086
Are you all right, Danny?

01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:49.391
Yes.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.595
All right.

01:34:54.647 --> 01:34:57.434
All right.
Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.936
For god's sake, smithy,
you've left out a whole bloody eagle.

01:35:03.031 --> 01:35:04.396
That's impossible.

01:35:08.745 --> 01:35:10.952
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:14.496
I'm sorry, Colin.

01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:16.746
It's all right, smithy.

01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:19.790
It's getting late.

01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:22.042
You push off to bed. I'll pack up here.

01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:23.293
Right.

01:35:24.177 --> 01:35:25.633
Good night, Colin.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.960
Good night, smithy.

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:08.960
I can't see a bloody thing.

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:27.653
Hell Hitler.

01:36:37.917 --> 01:36:40.829
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:42.998
Oh, now, watch it, haynes.

01:36:43.089 --> 01:36:46.297
That's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:48.591
- Sorry, Mac.
- Okay. But remember: German always.

01:36:48.678 --> 01:36:50.214
- Right-o.
- All right?

01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:06.234
One, two, three, four, five.

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:26.583
Roger?

01:37:31.721 --> 01:37:33.211
No, it's me.

01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:38.015
How do you like the old escape suit?

01:37:38.102 --> 01:37:39.467
Fine, fine.

01:37:42.357 --> 01:37:43.472
Colin...

01:37:46.569 --> 01:37:48.150
How do you like mine?

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:50.520
It looks splendid.

01:38:17.642 --> 01:38:20.099
Danny, where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

01:38:20.186 --> 01:38:23.394
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:29.609
Danny, we're getting out
through the tunnel. We're almost clear.

01:38:29.695 --> 01:38:31.856
Please, Willie, let me alone.

01:38:32.532 --> 01:38:34.648
I can't go in that tunnel anymore.

01:38:35.368 --> 01:38:37.450
So I'm going out through the wire.

01:38:41.374 --> 01:38:43.035
Danny, think.

01:38:43.126 --> 01:38:45.242
We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

01:38:45.336 --> 01:38:47.793
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:50.129
- I go out now.
- No.

01:38:51.634 --> 01:38:54.626
Danny, you go through that wire,
and you'll get killed.

01:39:02.353 --> 01:39:03.638
Don't do that.

01:39:06.274 --> 01:39:07.434
Willie...

01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:11.734
Since I was a boy,

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:16.941
I hated and feared little rooms,

01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:19.150
closets, caves.

01:39:19.245 --> 01:39:21.736
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:23.867
Because I must get out.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:27.082
I hide the fear, and I dig.

01:39:28.504 --> 01:39:31.962
But tomorrow night,
in the tunnel with all those men,

01:39:32.717 --> 01:39:35.379
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:37.506
and ruin the escape for everybody.

01:39:40.933 --> 01:39:42.173
So I go now.

01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:50.272
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.

01:39:52.153 --> 01:39:54.895
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

01:39:56.532 --> 01:39:57.738
All right.

01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:09.246
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

01:40:09.962 --> 01:40:12.624
Well, how do you think we look?

01:40:16.219 --> 01:40:18.005
It's as bad as all that?

01:40:18.095 --> 01:40:22.213
Colin, I - I want first of all to say
that without you,

01:40:22.934 --> 01:40:24.674
we would not have been ready.

01:40:24.769 --> 01:40:28.307
Oh, that's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.

01:40:30.274 --> 01:40:31.810
What's the matter, Roger?

01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:34.434
You can't go.

01:40:36.072 --> 01:40:37.937
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.

01:40:38.032 --> 01:40:39.032
Why?

01:40:39.116 --> 01:40:42.199
Because you can't see your hand
in front of your face.

01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:44.072
You'd be caught before you got ten yards.

01:40:44.956 --> 01:40:46.412
That's ridiculous.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.615
That's ridiculous.

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:52.918
Never heard anything so absurd in my life.
I can see perfectly.

01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:55.079
I can see perfectly!

01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:59.129
I can see... that pin down there.

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.302
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

01:41:13.609 --> 01:41:16.726
Colin, do you, uh,
see the foot of the door?

01:41:18.114 --> 01:41:19.274
Yes, of course.

01:41:21.576 --> 01:41:23.282
Put the pin down there, will you?

01:41:24.829 --> 01:41:26.114
All right.

01:41:30.876 --> 01:41:31.991
All right. Come on.

01:41:33.212 --> 01:41:34.702
Come on, sit down.

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:39.214
Sit down. It was a good try.

01:41:40.803 --> 01:41:44.011
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

01:41:44.682 --> 01:41:47.970
- It's too risky for you.
- Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

01:41:48.603 --> 01:41:50.685
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:53.057
We all know the score here.

01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:56.312
Well, at least most of us do.

01:41:56.402 --> 01:41:59.815
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:01.770
to foul up the Germans behind the lines.

01:42:01.866 --> 01:42:04.073
All right, that's fine, that's fine.

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:06.822
But once we get past that barbed wire,
once we have them looking

01:42:06.912 --> 01:42:08.868
all over Germany for us,

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.492
that mission is accomplished.

01:42:11.208 --> 01:42:14.325
Afterwards, we have some ideas of our own.

01:42:15.713 --> 01:42:17.578
You mean getting home?

01:42:17.673 --> 01:42:19.914
- Back to your family and children?
- That's right.

01:42:20.009 --> 01:42:23.501
Good god, man. Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that too?

01:42:23.596 --> 01:42:25.086
I'm sure you have.

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.388
I know Colin has.

01:42:29.852 --> 01:42:34.016
And, Roger, I have too.
We think we can make it all the way.

01:42:34.106 --> 01:42:35.562
Not Colin.

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:38.767
He'd be an appalling hazard to the escape.
That must be my decision.

01:42:38.861 --> 01:42:42.353
You want to talk about hazard,
let's talk about you.

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:46.737
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The gestapo has you marked.

01:42:48.996 --> 01:42:50.736
No one has said you can't go.

01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:54.118
That's true.

01:42:55.336 --> 01:42:57.327
And I have thought about the gestapo.

01:42:59.757 --> 01:43:03.796
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go,

01:43:03.886 --> 01:43:05.126
or dare go...

01:43:06.806 --> 01:43:08.922
Or should be permitted to play god...

01:43:10.726 --> 01:43:12.216
I can't answer you.

01:43:13.938 --> 01:43:15.553
But I can tell you,

01:43:16.232 --> 01:43:20.020
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
not only to himself but the whole plan

01:43:20.111 --> 01:43:22.818
and must therefore be eliminated
from the operation.

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:37.200
Colin's not a blind man
as long as he's with me,

01:43:37.294 --> 01:43:39.034
and he's going with me.

01:43:45.344 --> 01:43:47.084
It's all right with you, Colin?

01:43:49.807 --> 01:43:52.389
Oh, yes. Quite.

01:43:59.942 --> 01:44:01.148
Very well.

01:44:01.986 --> 01:44:04.853
I'll arrange for your escape numbers
to be altered accordingly.

01:44:06.615 --> 01:44:08.196
Good night, gentlemen.

01:44:15.499 --> 01:44:16.739
Actually...

01:44:18.586 --> 01:44:20.122
He's quite right.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.461
He's completely right.

01:44:23.466 --> 01:44:25.548
I really shouldn't go at all.

01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:29.092
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:31.887
I think they call it progressive myopia.

01:44:33.309 --> 01:44:37.973
I can see things up here, close to.
I can see to work.

01:44:38.063 --> 01:44:39.348
But, uh...

01:44:41.609 --> 01:44:42.724
You're just a blur.

01:44:44.153 --> 01:44:45.268
I know.

01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:49.568
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:55.319
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

01:44:57.291 --> 01:44:58.622
Splendid.

01:45:17.603 --> 01:45:18.603
Aus.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:45.995
Hi, hilts.

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:48.289
Hey, Mac.

01:45:51.387 --> 01:45:52.387
When?

01:45:53.138 --> 01:45:55.595
Tonight.
We thought they'd never let you out.

01:45:55.683 --> 01:45:57.765
Me too. Let's get at it.

01:45:58.394 --> 01:46:00.476
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:13.259
What time?

01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:17.545
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

01:47:21.727 --> 01:47:22.727
You okay?

01:47:34.156 --> 01:47:35.271
Cavendish.

01:47:36.241 --> 01:47:39.199
Griff, down there. Goff, there.

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.382
Smith, foles, third on the right.

01:48:03.602 --> 01:48:06.389
Blythe, hendley, third on the left.

01:48:35.134 --> 01:48:37.591
There are the lights.

01:48:39.013 --> 01:48:40.753
Right on the tick, Danny.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.516
Look down the tunnel, Danny.

01:48:53.610 --> 01:48:55.521
It's lovely.

01:48:57.031 --> 01:49:00.194
It's just like blackpool
at the height of the season.

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:04.033
You ever been to blackpool, Danny?

01:49:04.997 --> 01:49:05.997
Yes.

01:49:06.999 --> 01:49:07.999
No.

01:49:09.710 --> 01:49:10.916
I don't know.

01:49:14.757 --> 01:49:15.757
It's time, Roger.

01:49:29.438 --> 01:49:32.521
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-pitt.

01:49:36.487 --> 01:49:37.727
It's all clear, sir.

01:49:46.622 --> 01:49:48.328
We're all set, Roger.

01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:02.505
Roger.

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:04.343
Good luck.

01:50:36.004 --> 01:50:37.869
They're coming down the shaft now, Danny.

01:50:38.715 --> 01:50:40.956
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

01:50:48.183 --> 01:50:49.218
Willie...

01:50:50.435 --> 01:50:53.302
I can't wait till it's over.
I must get out.

01:50:54.064 --> 01:50:55.850
Danny! Danny! Danny!

01:50:56.942 --> 01:50:58.182
Danny!

01:51:25.554 --> 01:51:27.419
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?

01:51:27.514 --> 01:51:29.004
I must - - Danny! Come here!

01:51:29.683 --> 01:51:32.846
Roger? Roger, Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.

01:51:32.936 --> 01:51:35.222
Danny, tell me what this is,
and tell me quickly!

01:51:35.898 --> 01:51:40.062
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.

01:51:40.152 --> 01:51:42.438
I was buried many times. I go when I want.

01:51:42.529 --> 01:51:44.394
Let me out. Let me out.

01:51:47.576 --> 01:51:48.816
Take him out, Willie.

01:51:48.911 --> 01:51:50.321
Roger - - take him out.

01:52:04.927 --> 01:52:06.463
Danny? What is it?

01:52:07.429 --> 01:52:09.590
Danny, what's going on?

01:52:09.681 --> 01:52:12.764
It's all right, Sedgwick. It's all right.
We're going later.

01:52:19.524 --> 01:52:22.061
Danny - Danny, it's all right.
It's all right.

01:52:22.152 --> 01:52:25.394
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.

01:52:26.949 --> 01:52:28.735
All right, Colin. Down you go.

01:52:29.618 --> 01:52:32.735
Sit down. Feel the top rung of the ladder
with your right foot.

01:52:32.829 --> 01:52:34.319
Got it? Huh?

01:52:34.414 --> 01:52:35.574
Down you go.

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:53.054
Danny cut out, huh?

01:52:53.809 --> 01:52:56.516
Willie took him up top. Hilts, I, uh...

01:53:09.366 --> 01:53:12.028
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:30.584
Right.

01:53:37.519 --> 01:53:39.055
Psst! Bartlett!

01:53:42.024 --> 01:53:43.024
Ohl

01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:19.425
All right?

01:54:20.645 --> 01:54:22.977
Hold on to yourself, bartlett.
You're 20 feet short.

01:54:23.065 --> 01:54:26.102
What do you mean, 20 feet short?
You're 20 feet short of the woods.

01:54:26.193 --> 01:54:29.902
The hole is in right here in the open.
The guard is between us and the lights.

01:54:29.988 --> 01:54:32.070
How could that happen? The survey -

01:54:32.157 --> 01:54:34.398
what the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.

01:54:49.549 --> 01:54:51.790
- Roger -
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!

01:54:53.345 --> 01:54:55.336
We could postpone it
till we dig to the trees.

01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:57.967
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

01:55:02.771 --> 01:55:04.602
One chance.

01:55:04.689 --> 01:55:07.852
When the guard goes to the far end,
you might be able to move your men out.

01:55:07.943 --> 01:55:11.527
I think I can make it to the woods,
set up a signal when you're clear.

01:55:11.613 --> 01:55:14.320
- What about the goon towers?
- A chance you're gonna have to take.

01:55:20.914 --> 01:55:23.200
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

01:55:24.292 --> 01:55:26.328
Send down 30 feet of rope!

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:30.086
Send down 30 feet of rope.

01:55:32.217 --> 01:55:33.832
Send down 30 feet of rope!

01:55:33.927 --> 01:55:35.838
- What?
- Thirty feet of rope!

01:55:35.929 --> 01:55:38.841
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

01:55:54.239 --> 01:55:56.275
How's it going, Tommy? Have you heard?

01:55:56.366 --> 01:55:58.357
Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

01:55:59.119 --> 01:56:02.111
- Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
- I don't think so, sir.

01:56:25.687 --> 01:56:27.052
He's over there.

01:56:33.612 --> 01:56:35.853
Right. You go first, Eric.

01:56:36.865 --> 01:56:39.026
- I'm staying here till we get moving.
- Right.

01:56:50.378 --> 01:56:52.790
- See you in piccadilly.
- Scott's bar.

01:56:52.881 --> 01:56:54.212
Right.

01:57:07.312 --> 01:57:09.303
Thank you. Good luck.

01:57:09.397 --> 01:57:10.397
Right.

01:57:35.674 --> 01:57:36.880
We're moving.

01:57:43.848 --> 01:57:47.306
Danny, they're moving through
the tunnel now. They're getting out.

01:57:51.022 --> 01:57:53.229
Danny, when Warsaw fell,

01:57:53.316 --> 01:57:55.932
you escaped and came to england
because you're a flier.

01:57:56.611 --> 01:57:59.853
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

01:58:01.032 --> 01:58:04.115
We can get out now.
We can get back to england.

01:58:05.996 --> 01:58:08.282
Danny,
if you don't go through that tunnel,

01:58:08.373 --> 01:58:10.534
everything you've done
will have been for nothing.

01:58:10.625 --> 01:58:11.785
Nothing!

01:58:40.697 --> 01:58:42.562
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

01:58:45.243 --> 01:58:47.029
In here, Colin. Come on.

01:58:47.746 --> 01:58:48.861
Sit down.

01:58:54.502 --> 01:58:56.367
You're up, Sedgwick. I'll take over.

01:59:00.467 --> 01:59:03.709
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.

01:59:03.803 --> 01:59:05.964
Sedgwick,
you won't get this thing through.

01:59:06.056 --> 01:59:07.091
I'll cope.

01:59:10.352 --> 01:59:12.684
Was that Sedgwick with his steamer trunk?

01:59:12.771 --> 01:59:15.478
- Who else?
- I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

01:59:22.656 --> 01:59:24.442
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell -

01:59:24.532 --> 01:59:28.366
we're 20 feet short. Hilts is on
the other end of that rope in the woods.

01:59:28.453 --> 01:59:30.373
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,
off you go,

01:59:30.455 --> 01:59:32.946
- but keep Colin low on the way across.
- Right.

01:59:34.334 --> 01:59:35.949
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

01:59:46.012 --> 01:59:47.012
What's that?

01:59:49.099 --> 01:59:52.057
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, god, no!

01:59:52.143 --> 01:59:55.431
The goons'll pull the switches,
and we'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

01:59:55.522 --> 01:59:58.685
Come on, Colin. We can get out
when the lights go down.

02:00:11.579 --> 02:00:12.579
Willie.

02:00:13.498 --> 02:00:14.498
Willie!

02:00:16.835 --> 02:00:19.076
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!

02:00:26.136 --> 02:00:27.342
Get 'em out.

02:00:33.435 --> 02:00:35.517
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.

02:00:35.603 --> 02:00:37.844
- It's gonna cave!
- Danny. Danny, it's all right.

02:00:37.939 --> 02:00:39.645
Danny, there's the lights.

02:00:40.859 --> 02:00:43.396
Light the fat lamps down there!

02:00:44.738 --> 02:00:47.445
There's been an air raid,
and they've cut the lights, Danny.

02:00:47.532 --> 02:00:50.490
Danny, the tunnel, it's all right.
Listen to me!

02:00:51.953 --> 02:00:53.784
Danny, look. Here.

02:00:56.958 --> 02:01:01.577
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.

02:01:09.012 --> 02:01:10.548
What the hell's going on?

02:01:10.638 --> 02:01:12.003
You go.

02:01:12.807 --> 02:01:15.514
No, Danny - Danny -

02:01:15.602 --> 02:01:17.012
go.

02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:27.230
- What is this, Willie?
- I brought Danny there.

02:01:27.322 --> 02:01:29.529
- Is he stuck in there?
- No, he's all right.

02:01:29.616 --> 02:01:31.356
Get him out fast.

02:01:33.745 --> 02:01:35.155
Psst! Come on!

02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:39.956
Come on, Danny, move.

02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:57.925
Up you go.

02:02:04.651 --> 02:02:06.061
Give me your bag.

02:02:12.992 --> 02:02:14.528
We're on the rope!

02:03:00.248 --> 02:03:04.241
You and I had better get out, or we won't
have a chance of any of the trains.

02:03:04.335 --> 02:03:07.202
It's moving. We'll just have to pass
the instructions from man to man.

02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:10.921
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:59.921
Come on, come on.

02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:19.910
Come on.

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:40.045
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

02:04:41.599 --> 02:04:42.839
Don't shoot!

02:04:42.934 --> 02:04:44.344
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

02:04:44.435 --> 02:04:46.892
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

02:04:49.816 --> 02:04:51.727
Get off! We're coming back!

02:05:15.174 --> 02:05:18.462
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot
of shooting going on up there.

02:05:18.553 --> 02:05:20.794
Think they've been shooting them
as they came out?

02:05:20.888 --> 02:05:23.174
No, couldn't be.
We would've heard the shots before.

02:05:26.269 --> 02:05:27.384
Pull!

02:05:27.478 --> 02:05:29.594
- Wait for me.
- Away!

02:05:34.819 --> 02:05:35.854
Out.

02:05:57.633 --> 02:05:58.633
Out.

02:06:33.169 --> 02:06:35.501
- How many did he say?
- Seventy-six.

02:06:35.588 --> 02:06:36.919
Seventy-six.

02:06:37.006 --> 02:06:38.462
- Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.

02:06:51.646 --> 02:06:53.307
Dismissed.

02:06:53.898 --> 02:06:55.308
A-ten hut!

02:07:52.039 --> 02:07:55.281
Half the guys who missed their trains
are piled up in this station.

02:07:55.376 --> 02:07:58.584
Ashley-pitt, Roger, MacDonald, nimmo.

02:07:58.671 --> 02:08:00.536
Makes quite a group.

02:08:00.631 --> 02:08:01.916
What do we do?

02:08:02.758 --> 02:08:04.089
Wait for the train.

02:12:12.883 --> 02:12:14.089
Danke schon.

02:14:09.166 --> 02:14:10.326
Tally-ho.

02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:46.525
- Merci.
- Merci bien.

02:14:54.086 --> 02:14:55.292
Tally-ho.

02:15:15.608 --> 02:15:17.439
- Danke.
- Danke.

02:15:28.746 --> 02:15:30.202
Are the police on the train?

02:15:30.289 --> 02:15:32.701
Yes. The gestapo are with them.
We're gonna jump.

02:15:32.791 --> 02:15:33.951
All right.

02:15:39.548 --> 02:15:40.788
I'll tell you when.

02:15:40.883 --> 02:15:43.625
I'd prefer you just to give me
a good, firm push.

02:16:03.072 --> 02:16:05.529
Are you all right?
Yes. I'm fine.

02:16:06.325 --> 02:16:08.031
That was quite exciting.

02:16:09.912 --> 02:16:11.118
It isn't stopping.

02:16:12.039 --> 02:16:13.575
No, we're all right.

02:17:08.971 --> 02:17:10.255
Switzerland.

02:17:43.922 --> 02:17:46.004
Hey!

02:17:59.521 --> 02:18:01.557
Hey! Halt! Halt!

02:21:53.171 --> 02:21:54.171
Bartlett.

02:22:53.732 --> 02:22:55.597
Where were you going, cavendish?

02:22:55.692 --> 02:22:58.604
L, uh - I hadn't quite decided.

02:22:58.695 --> 02:23:01.562
What information were you to collect
on the way?

02:23:01.656 --> 02:23:02.656
None.

02:23:02.741 --> 02:23:05.178
What sabotage directions did you receive?

02:23:05.202 --> 02:23:07.534
What have you done with your papers?

02:23:09.414 --> 02:23:12.906
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.

02:23:13.001 --> 02:23:16.118
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

02:23:16.213 --> 02:23:18.545
All I did was to escape
from a prison camp.

02:23:18.632 --> 02:23:21.499
You'd do the same
if you'd been locked up for three years.

02:23:22.302 --> 02:23:23.542
I wanted to get home.

02:23:23.637 --> 02:23:26.754
I don't think you'll ever see
your wife and children again.

02:23:26.848 --> 02:23:29.180
You've obviously got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

02:23:29.267 --> 02:23:31.053
You're wearing civilian clothes.

02:23:32.938 --> 02:23:35.896
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.

02:23:36.566 --> 02:23:40.479
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.

02:23:42.114 --> 02:23:44.696
I dyed it with some boot Polish
to cover some oil smears

02:23:44.783 --> 02:23:46.774
I picked up when I was shot down.

02:23:57.838 --> 02:24:00.170
And you lost your insignia over the years?

02:24:00.841 --> 02:24:02.001
That's right.

02:24:07.931 --> 02:24:09.922
- Look -
- That's all, cavendish.

02:24:35.041 --> 02:24:36.326
Hello, boys.

02:24:41.006 --> 02:24:42.291
Hello, David.

02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:47.251
- Hello, haynes.
- Hello, cavendish.

02:24:49.055 --> 02:24:51.671
I wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

02:24:51.766 --> 02:24:53.222
Just picked up?

02:24:53.310 --> 02:24:55.050
Yes, this morning.

02:25:11.953 --> 02:25:14.569
There's a trainer out there I can fly.

02:25:14.664 --> 02:25:17.121
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:26.360
Colin...

02:26:27.570 --> 02:26:29.936
When I say go, crank this clockwise.

02:26:30.740 --> 02:26:34.073
When the engine catches, don't move,
or you'll get a mouthful of propeller.

02:26:48.591 --> 02:26:49.591
Go.

02:27:40.352 --> 02:27:42.058
Next stop, Switzerland!

02:29:04.853 --> 02:29:05.933
The alps.

02:29:06.896 --> 02:29:07.896
Splendid.

02:29:20.034 --> 02:29:23.322
Over this range, then 20 more minutes
and we've got it made.

02:29:51.232 --> 02:29:52.688
What is it? Petrol?

02:29:52.775 --> 02:29:55.437
I don't know. Fuel pump, carburetor.
We're losing power.

02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:22.460
Go that way! I'll follow!

02:30:47.372 --> 02:30:48.487
Hendley?

02:30:53.628 --> 02:30:54.708
Colin?

02:30:59.467 --> 02:31:01.924
Stop! Don't shoot! Please, don't -

02:31:05.974 --> 02:31:06.974
Colin?

02:31:08.476 --> 02:31:10.012
I'm sorry I fouled things up.

02:31:11.688 --> 02:31:13.053
That's all right.

02:31:14.524 --> 02:31:16.105
Thank you for...

02:31:17.485 --> 02:31:20.147
Getting me... out.

02:34:22.837 --> 02:34:24.168
Café suzette.

02:34:26.048 --> 02:34:27.083
Oul

02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:41.010
Bon appeéftit, monsieur. Merci.

02:34:44.358 --> 02:34:47.691
Uh, monsieur? Uh, telephone pour vous.

02:34:48.738 --> 02:34:50.899
- Telephone pour moi?
- Oui, monsieur. Telephone.

02:34:55.495 --> 02:34:56.575
Merci

02:34:58.247 --> 02:34:59.407
hello?

02:35:00.750 --> 02:35:01.830
Hello?

02:35:39.914 --> 02:35:41.120
Résistance.

02:35:41.624 --> 02:35:42.909
Résistance?

02:35:43.543 --> 02:35:45.158
Uh, you are english?

02:35:45.962 --> 02:35:47.543
Uh, I'm Australian.

02:35:48.381 --> 02:35:51.248
You can speak english. I understand.

02:35:51.342 --> 02:35:52.673
Bloody good.

02:35:53.427 --> 02:35:57.796
I'm a British officer. I've just escaped
from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

02:35:57.890 --> 02:36:01.178
I'm trying to make my way into Spain now.
You understand me?

02:36:01.269 --> 02:36:03.225
- Oui.
- Can you help me, now?

02:36:05.398 --> 02:36:06.513
Huh?

02:36:07.358 --> 02:36:09.314
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

02:36:32.675 --> 02:36:34.131
Jawohl

02:36:50.651 --> 02:36:52.141
Au revoir, monsieur. Au revoir.

02:36:52.236 --> 02:36:54.852
Au revoir good luck.

02:36:55.698 --> 02:36:56.983
Thank you.

02:38:02.515 --> 02:38:04.301
Halt! Halt!

02:38:49.228 --> 02:38:51.389
You are english.

02:39:33.522 --> 02:39:34.932
Herr bartlett?

02:39:42.907 --> 02:39:44.568
Your German is good.

02:39:45.493 --> 02:39:47.484
And I hear also your French.

02:39:49.538 --> 02:39:52.325
Your arms... up!

02:40:21.570 --> 02:40:22.730
Ah!

02:40:28.702 --> 02:40:30.784
Herr bartlett.

02:40:31.413 --> 02:40:33.529
And herr MacDonald.

02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:38.451
Oh, we are together again.

02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:42.872
You are going to wish
you had never put us to so much trouble.

02:40:59.150 --> 02:41:00.936
What's troubling you, Roger?

02:41:01.026 --> 02:41:02.982
I'm just a little surprised.

02:41:03.070 --> 02:41:06.608
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

02:41:06.699 --> 02:41:07.779
Yes.

02:41:08.659 --> 02:41:11.366
I have to admit, I -
I'm a little worried, though.

02:41:11.453 --> 02:41:14.115
I hope to god I haven't blotted
70-odd ledgers.

02:41:14.206 --> 02:41:16.288
Och, no, no.

02:41:16.375 --> 02:41:19.959
We're all over 21,
footloose and fancy-free.

02:41:20.045 --> 02:41:23.128
We'd never have got as far as we did
without you, Roger.

02:41:23.215 --> 02:41:26.753
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

02:41:26.844 --> 02:41:29.802
- I think we all do.
- Yes.

02:42:09.970 --> 02:42:13.554
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

02:42:13.641 --> 02:42:16.383
It will take hours
before you reach the camp.

02:42:38.332 --> 02:42:40.118
You know, Mac, all this -

02:42:40.209 --> 02:42:43.952
the organization, tunneling,
Tom and Harry -

02:42:44.046 --> 02:42:45.331
kept me alive.

02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:48.205
And even though we...

02:42:50.219 --> 02:42:51.800
I've never been happier.

02:42:53.264 --> 02:42:55.050
You know, Mac -

02:43:35.639 --> 02:43:38.756
Eleven of your men
are being returned today.

02:43:38.851 --> 02:43:40.557
Oh? Who?

02:43:40.644 --> 02:43:42.384
I do not have that information.

02:43:43.063 --> 02:43:44.519
I -

02:43:45.774 --> 02:43:49.062
I am directed by a higher authority
to inform you that -

02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:54.647
that 50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

02:43:56.285 --> 02:43:57.285
Shot?

02:43:58.829 --> 02:44:02.788
Their -
their personal effects will be returned.

02:44:05.336 --> 02:44:06.951
How many of them were wounded?

02:44:09.465 --> 02:44:12.628
Here are the names... of the dead.

02:44:16.055 --> 02:44:17.886
How many of the 50 were wounded?

02:44:19.808 --> 02:44:20.968
None.

02:44:22.227 --> 02:44:25.094
The - the higher authority

02:44:25.856 --> 02:44:28.393
only directs me to inform you that -

02:44:31.487 --> 02:44:32.977
that 50 men were...

02:44:39.578 --> 02:44:40.693
I see.

02:44:42.831 --> 02:44:44.822
Addison, John.

02:44:44.917 --> 02:44:46.953
Alladale, Peter.

02:44:47.044 --> 02:44:49.160
Bancroft, Edward.

02:44:49.254 --> 02:44:51.415
Bartlett, Roger.

02:44:51.507 --> 02:44:53.043
Cavendish, Dennis.

02:44:53.801 --> 02:44:56.213
Eldridge, David.

02:44:56.303 --> 02:44:58.294
Felton, William.

02:44:59.390 --> 02:45:01.346
Fanshaw, Arthur.

02:46:04.288 --> 02:46:06.279
- Au revoir.
- Merci beaucoup, monsieur.

02:46:06.373 --> 02:46:09.206
Au revoir. Au revoir.

02:46:09.293 --> 02:46:10.703
Bonne chance.

02:46:25.642 --> 02:46:27.473
I am your guide, serior.

02:46:27.561 --> 02:46:28.846
To Spain?

02:46:29.938 --> 02:46:31.098
Esparia.

02:46:51.084 --> 02:46:53.746
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

02:46:53.837 --> 02:46:56.249
How many have been brought back, sir?
You're the first.

02:46:56.340 --> 02:46:58.581
- Do you know how many got away, sir?
- Not yet.

02:46:59.801 --> 02:47:01.291
What happened to blythe?

02:47:02.596 --> 02:47:04.211
He didn't make it, sir.

02:47:05.098 --> 02:47:07.009
Roger was right about that.

02:47:08.018 --> 02:47:10.100
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it either.

02:47:13.398 --> 02:47:17.061
I've just posted the list. They shot 50.

02:47:17.986 --> 02:47:19.692
The gestapo murdered them.

02:47:21.073 --> 02:47:22.529
Fifty?

02:47:22.616 --> 02:47:24.481
MacDonald, Ashley-pitt?

02:47:25.661 --> 02:47:27.868
- Yes.
- Danny and Willie?

02:47:27.955 --> 02:47:29.536
No, they're not on the list.

02:47:30.332 --> 02:47:32.323
- Haynes?
- Yes.

02:47:34.294 --> 02:47:35.500
I'm sorry.

02:47:37.839 --> 02:47:41.377
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.

02:47:41.468 --> 02:47:42.833
Mess up the works.

02:47:43.887 --> 02:47:46.754
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

02:47:47.599 --> 02:47:49.385
Do you think it was worth the price?

02:47:50.811 --> 02:47:53.097
That depends on your point of view,
hendley.

02:47:56.400 --> 02:47:57.560
Yes, sir.

02:48:11.331 --> 02:48:12.992
Achtung!

02:48:46.491 --> 02:48:47.776
Achtung!

02:48:47.868 --> 02:48:51.406
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

02:48:59.546 --> 02:49:01.377
The job just didn't work out, huh?

02:49:02.174 --> 02:49:03.630
You were lucky, hilts.

02:49:03.717 --> 02:49:05.878
Lucky? It won't be because I didn't...

02:49:07.888 --> 02:49:10.254
- How many?
- Fifty.

02:49:12.893 --> 02:49:14.429
It looks, after all,

02:49:15.145 --> 02:49:17.887
as if you will see Berlin before I do.

02:50:10.784 --> 02:50:11.819
Sir.

02:50:19.418 --> 02:50:20.533
Hey, hilts!
