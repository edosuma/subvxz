WEBVTT

00:16.099 --> 00:18.268
The car chase between the police
and a stolen vehicle continues.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.895
That bastard...!

00:20.103 --> 00:23.398
-Nagai! You don't have to do this!
-Stay out of it, Nakano!

00:23.607 --> 00:24.650
What is your job?

00:24.858 --> 00:25.859
To protect you.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.820
I never wanted to see your face again.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.364
Kill her!

00:30.572 --> 00:31.532
Stop!

00:32.908 --> 00:36.411
-I came here to make a deal with you.
-As if I could trust an Ajin!

00:36.620 --> 00:38.914
We plan to take down Sato, no matter what!

00:39.122 --> 00:44.211
So listen... We'll be your pawns!
As your immortal soldiers!

00:45.712 --> 00:48.799
-The suspects have been arrested.
-Was it really Kei Nagai?

00:49.091 --> 00:53.136
No, it was someone else.
Just looked like him.

00:58.058 --> 01:02.187
<i>Hello. We meet again. It's Sato.</i>

01:03.855 --> 01:09.152
<i>As far as I know, the government has</i>
<i>not yet responded to my demands.</i>

01:09.987 --> 01:12.531
<i>So I decided to get started.</i>

01:16.535 --> 01:20.497
<i>That's right, with the top</i>
<i>of the batting order, Mr. Wakai.</i>

01:25.043 --> 01:27.379
<i>And this is...</i>

01:32.175 --> 01:34.928
<i>the beginning of the countdown.</i>

01:35.554 --> 01:40.642
<i>When the second wave finishes,</i>
<i>we'll move on to the third wave.</i>

01:41.184 --> 01:45.397
<i>The third... is the final wave.</i>

01:48.150 --> 01:50.736
<i>I am going to take over this country.</i>

01:52.946 --> 01:57.951
This was uploaded to AJIN.net
about ten minutes ago.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.415
A storm is coming.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.927
<i>Close combat</i>
<i>I'm slashing</i>

02:16.345 --> 02:20.974
<i>You who are standing in front of me</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>

02:27.064 --> 02:28.231
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

02:28.315 --> 02:33.236
<i>Running away but not forever</i>
<i>Chewing and swallowing reality</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:37.282
<i>Shout it out</i>
<i>And refuse ambiguity</i>

02:37.783 --> 02:41.161
<i>Though you know the danger of the dark</i>

02:41.244 --> 02:44.081
<i>A type of system that is too cold</i>

02:44.164 --> 02:47.250
<i>On or off</i>
<i>Which one is it now?</i>

02:48.502 --> 02:52.672
<i>Ending up killing emotions</i>
<i>Over and over</i>

02:52.756 --> 02:58.136
<i>No, I was just slipping through</i>
<i>Being destroyed, that's all</i>

02:58.845 --> 03:01.473
<i>Leave me alone</i>
<i>Craze</i>

03:01.556 --> 03:05.227
<i>I am I</i>
<i>Even if I am cornered</i>

03:05.310 --> 03:06.561
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

03:06.645 --> 03:09.398
<i>Started with nothing but risk</i>
<i>From the beginning</i>

03:09.481 --> 03:11.983
<i>Give it all you got</i>
<i>Craze</i>

03:12.067 --> 03:17.072
<i>Reveal your true self, your instincts</i>
<i>Time to strike back</i>

03:17.155 --> 03:19.408
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>So I slashed</i>

03:19.491 --> 03:21.993
<i>Who are you?</i>

03:36.967 --> 03:40.429
I'M SURROUNDED BY IDIOTS

03:49.521 --> 03:52.274
Don't mess up the portions now.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.734
I know!

03:54.568 --> 03:57.237
You're starting to sound
like Okuyama more and more.

03:57.863 --> 04:01.158
We'll only die... if you screw things up.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.539
Just like him, or what?

04:07.622 --> 04:08.957
Good one, good one!

04:18.341 --> 04:20.594
All right. All finished.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.265
Looks fantastic.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.685
You could get an Oscar nomination
for something like this.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.313
BOARDING PASS

04:35.525 --> 04:37.068
Here, take this.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.112
Give it to Sato.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.282
-You're sure you got two seats?
-Yep.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.202
And it definitely can't be traced, right?

04:47.078 --> 04:51.166
If only you were that careful about
shooting targets, you'd be so much better.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.209
Shut up.

04:52.918 --> 04:56.129
It'll be fine. The card I used
was under another name.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.759
I used info for the card
I bought from a Russian site.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.929
They had quite a few with Japanese names.

05:05.263 --> 05:09.518
That, and the transaction was done
using virtual currency. It's untraceable.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.186
Really?

05:11.394 --> 05:15.148
The world has certainly changed
quite a lot while I was away.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.360
A middle school kid could do this stuff
if they wanted to.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.571
Tanaka...

05:22.864 --> 05:23.907
Who the hell...?!

05:23.990 --> 05:27.661
Careful there! It's me!

05:30.163 --> 05:32.749
Mr. Sato, is that you?

05:34.626 --> 05:36.753
Looks good, doesn't it?

05:44.386 --> 05:47.055
Are you sure Okuyama can really do this?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.182
He kind of sucks.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.018
Normally, you'd be the one
doing this sort of thing.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.062
But your face is too well known.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.773
Anyway, we'll be fine.

06:10.120 --> 06:14.457
Why do I... have to do this...?

06:18.086 --> 06:19.254
I had enough.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.549
You haven't even done 20!

06:24.092 --> 06:26.303
That's because I'm a white-collar guy.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.555
Yes, people are suited
for different roles.

06:29.556 --> 06:33.560
But you've put on about four kilos
in the last 40 days.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.936
At least lose that.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.815
I wonder if this is like
working at a sweatshop.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.150
Kei Nagai!

06:43.570 --> 06:45.655
Keep going. Don't slack off.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.743
I should've killed you
when I had the chance!

06:49.826 --> 06:51.578
I'll pickle you in formaldehyde!

06:52.454 --> 06:54.122
What an ass...

07:00.545 --> 07:02.631
What? Three more sets?!

07:02.839 --> 07:04.883
That's twice as many as Nagai has to do!

07:04.966 --> 07:06.676
Like I said, we each have our role.

07:06.968 --> 07:10.430
-You're our muscle.
-What?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.265
You make me sound like a meathead.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.100
Enough complaining.

07:14.184 --> 07:17.646
When you're done, I'll show you
how to use the tranquilizer guns.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.523
Seriously?! I'll hold you to that!

07:31.701 --> 07:32.661
Mr. Tosaki.

07:33.745 --> 07:38.959
We just got a call from Sokabe, and he
said Sakurai won't change his plan.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.711
I see. Honestly.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.215
A business trip at a time like
this... what is he thinking?

07:45.924 --> 07:49.052
He said they've increased the size
of the security force,

07:49.135 --> 07:51.179
and he may be safer at his destination...

07:52.055 --> 07:52.931
Anyway...

07:53.515 --> 07:54.516
Shimomura.

07:55.266 --> 07:58.103
I want you to relocate here
as soon as you can.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.106
We have to put all of our focus
on our planning

08:01.189 --> 08:03.358
in order for us to be able
to capture Sato.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.567
Understood.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.403
To make this work,

08:06.486 --> 08:10.240
we'll have to figure out exactly
what we have that Sato doesn't.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.618
This will be our advance base.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.966
You'll never lose weight
if you drink that junk.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.886
I need a little sugar
after all that working out.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.139
That was just a bit of strength training.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.224
Nagai, Nakano.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.397
What is it?

08:42.480 --> 08:45.150
There's someone we want you to meet.
Follow me.

08:45.900 --> 08:46.776
Okay.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.742
What is it, Nakano?

08:54.659 --> 08:56.077
Ms. Shimomura...

08:57.537 --> 08:59.164
is really hot, isn't she?

09:00.915 --> 09:02.959
You think she's with Tosaki?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.252
They're always together.

09:04.335 --> 09:07.255
No, I don't think so.
I mean, she's an Ajin after all.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.758
-What?!
-You mean you didn't notice?

09:11.134 --> 09:13.470
She summoned a ghost
in the hospital, right?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.638
And when we escaped the village...

09:15.847 --> 09:17.515
I wonder if she's got a boyfriend...

09:18.391 --> 09:19.267
What are you doing?

09:21.019 --> 09:22.187
Come on, hurry up.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.320
Who's this?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.614
Ikuya Ogura.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.450
An Ajin researcher from America.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.951
And a genius.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.415
You're Kei Nagai.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.001
The third Ajin found in Japan.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.252
I'm Nakano.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.962
Ajin are fascinating.

09:48.421 --> 09:53.718
They somehow give a hint of worth
to our meaningless lives.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.554
-I'm Nakano--
-Mind if I smoke?

09:56.805 --> 09:59.349
Actually, cigarettes bother me.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.397
Nagai.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.610
Why do you think it is
that people eventually die?

10:10.819 --> 10:12.862
Because their heart stops?

10:14.864 --> 10:17.742
There's a limit to the number of times
their cells can regenerate.

10:17.826 --> 10:22.163
Once you go over that limit, regeneration
stops, and then life functions cease--

10:22.372 --> 10:25.917
No. It's because
that's what the universe decided.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.547
<i>Ogura, let's stay on topic.</i>
<i>Get to the point.</i>

10:31.256 --> 10:35.718
<i>According to "Tazaki"</i>
<i>on the other side of that camera there,</i>

10:35.802 --> 10:37.470
<i>you've got a rather odd IBM.</i>

10:37.971 --> 10:39.097
It's Tosaki.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.432
-Let's see it.
-What?

10:41.516 --> 10:42.350
What?!

10:43.059 --> 10:44.644
It might kill you.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.105
You sound like
a cigarette packaging warning.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.107
Are you sure, doctor?

10:49.190 --> 10:50.650
-Of course not!
-Settle down.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.278
How else can I make a proper diagnosis?

10:55.113 --> 10:56.823
But you won't be able to see it.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.326
I'll see it if you come at me
like you're going to kill me.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.177
The shape is plain, the density is high.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.556
It's remarkable
that it's so clearly visible.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.309
This place is like a sweatshop...

11:24.726 --> 11:26.519
-I really gotta piss.
-Speak.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.647
Just like in the report.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.026
It does the opposite of what
it's ordered to do.

11:33.651 --> 11:36.696
Seems twisted, through-and-through.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.034
Why me...?

11:41.868 --> 11:45.038
And it goes on autopilot
if it has no orders.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.081
This really is fascinating.

11:50.168 --> 11:55.298
I saw a similar example from another Ajin,
a farmer who lived in Iowa.

11:57.050 --> 12:02.639
<i>At first, he had the IBM weeding,</i>
<i>and doing simple work like that.</i>

12:03.056 --> 12:06.059
<i>But then one morning a few years later,</i>

12:06.976 --> 12:10.146
<i>it just spontaneously</i>
<i>started up the corn harvester.</i>

12:10.688 --> 12:12.690
<i>It was actually riding on the tractor.</i>

12:13.942 --> 12:16.819
I'd say yours has been left alone
for too long.

12:16.903 --> 12:21.324
Except the first time
that I used it was only a month ago.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.077
I don't think so. You've had it longer.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.704
Probably since you were a little kid.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.291
Watch out!!!

12:35.463 --> 12:36.714
How should I handle this?

12:37.340 --> 12:40.093
Just leave it.
It'll be gone in five minutes.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.136
What?

12:42.470 --> 12:47.684
When I was experimenting before,
I was able to keep it out for 30 minutes.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.396
How many could you summon in a row?

12:51.479 --> 12:54.023
The report says five.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.984
My personal record is nine.

12:58.111 --> 13:02.407
That's unusual. And the IBM
is abnormally dense.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.951
The ghost is... dense?

13:07.161 --> 13:09.497
Why is there so much?

13:15.336 --> 13:18.006
Actually, Sato said
something like that, too.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.049
Hey, Nagai! Look at my shirt!

13:20.466 --> 13:23.011
-Blue-collars are supposed to get dirty.
-This is red!

13:23.344 --> 13:28.057
This level of density would only be
possible given a very long time frame...

13:33.479 --> 13:36.274
No, it couldn't just be
the length of time...

13:36.524 --> 13:38.818
The density of IBMs also change

13:38.901 --> 13:41.779
based on the developmental stage
of the mind and ego...

13:46.784 --> 13:50.329
How long have you actually been an Ajin?

14:00.214 --> 14:03.009
Like I said, it's been about a month.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.597
Just a moment please.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.026
Thank you for waiting.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.278
Boarding begins 30 minutes before takeoff.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.988
Have a pleasant trip.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.866
Oh, I'm going to have a great time.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.829
All clear.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.555
Here... you... go...

14:49.764 --> 14:50.807
Thank you.

14:51.349 --> 14:55.853
You're... wel... wal... welcome.

14:56.104 --> 15:01.317
For such a talented guy, you certainly
have a hard time using your ghost.

15:01.651 --> 15:06.239
It's harb... harder to use th...
than machines.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.033
Well, everything takes practice.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.702
Simo... Häyhä.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.163
That's the Okuyama I know.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.500
Well... I'm off.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.968
-We get to Miyakojima on the second day.
-I bet there'll be some hotties there.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.970
Oh, man... I'm getting nervous.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.682
Already? I told you, my father's
a nice guy. You'll be fine.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.101
I hope there's no terrorist attacks
or anything.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.521
Forget about terrorists. Let's have a look
at the documents.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.566
Hey, did you see that guy
up in first class?

15:41.941 --> 15:45.153
Are they escorting
a prisoner or something?

15:46.612 --> 15:49.407
They wouldn't transport a prisoner
in first class.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.787
Quit looking so nervous.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.833
All the passengers
have had their IDs checked.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.335
-Isn't that right?
-Yes, sir.

16:02.628 --> 16:06.382
And they wouldn't follow us
out to Okinawa, anyway.

16:07.175 --> 16:11.012
Even if they show up, we'll just grab them
and throw them in the lab.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.930
Come on, Mr. Sakurai. Please!

16:16.267 --> 16:18.102
We will be taking off shortly.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.257
Well then.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.931
Sir, the fasten seatbelt sign
is still...

17:01.062 --> 17:02.188
Where's Sakurai?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.652
Excuse me, sir?

17:31.467 --> 17:32.843
What's going on?!

17:38.432 --> 17:39.767
Sato...

17:40.268 --> 17:42.520
Oh, there you are.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.105
You just went to the bathroom.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.302
<i>Bon voyage</i>.

18:32.903 --> 18:37.783
<i>So I can summon more IBMs</i>
<i>than Sato and his crew...</i>

18:39.035 --> 18:41.329
<i>I may be able to use that</i>
<i>to my advantage somehow.</i>

18:43.456 --> 18:46.834
How long have you been an Ajin?

18:54.467 --> 18:55.384
Nagai?

18:56.385 --> 18:57.345
Stop!

19:03.559 --> 19:04.769
Are you guys okay?

19:10.858 --> 19:12.276
Hey, Nagai!

19:15.780 --> 19:17.490
Are you crazy?

19:17.573 --> 19:19.450
They were just teaching me
how to shoot!

19:19.533 --> 19:24.330
You're the crazy one! Stop treating
those suits like they're your friends!

19:24.413 --> 19:25.373
What?!

19:26.248 --> 19:30.044
Their only skill
is that they can actually die.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.630
Besides, we've got them, and Sato doesn't.

19:32.713 --> 19:36.008
We might be able to use them
as pawns in our strategy.

19:36.676 --> 19:42.181
That's enough! Haven't you ever valued
human lives before?!

19:42.848 --> 19:43.891
No.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.812
So what about that guy they talked about
on the news?!

19:47.895 --> 19:51.023
That friend of yours,
the one who helped you escape?

19:54.151 --> 19:56.904
I'll be fine. On my way. It's okay now.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.823
Well, we're friends, right?

19:58.948 --> 20:01.492
Kei, listen, you're human.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.250
I don't need him anymore.

20:10.167 --> 20:13.421
Personal feelings
just complicate matters.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.590
You can't rely on them
to turn your situation around.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.634
I've known that people destroy themselves

20:18.718 --> 20:21.429
when they get carried away
with their emotions.

20:23.431 --> 20:24.390
You, scum!

20:25.516 --> 20:26.726
You, idiot.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.479
Where are Nagai and Nakano?

20:37.027 --> 20:37.862
Come!

20:39.655 --> 20:41.198
<i>For those of you just joining us,</i>

20:42.408 --> 20:44.452
<i>at approximately 3:25 p.m. today</i>

20:44.535 --> 20:47.913
<i>Flight TA167, departing Haneda airport</i>

20:47.997 --> 20:51.625
<i>had to make an emergency landing</i>
<i>in the waters just off the coast.</i>

20:52.209 --> 20:55.337
<i>According to official reports,</i>
<i>Kazuo Sakurai,</i>

20:55.421 --> 20:58.841
<i>who is on the Ajin Sato's hit list,</i>
<i>was onboard.</i>

20:58.924 --> 21:02.136
<i>Police are considering the possibility</i>
<i>of Sato's involvement...</i>

21:02.344 --> 21:05.848
This is why I told him
not to take a damn business trip.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.057
-So...
-Yes.

21:07.641 --> 21:11.145
This is Sato's work. No doubt about it.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.623
You idiot.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.292
I don't need him anymore.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.376
Speak.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.049
Don't knock down that tree.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.053
Hey.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.888
Shut up.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.559
-Kill me!
-Okay.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.104
Stop, you idiot.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.819
What the hell?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.321
You're the crazy one!

22:02.404 --> 22:04.573
I've known...

22:04.657 --> 22:07.201
You're the crazy one!

22:07.743 --> 22:09.370
I should've killed you
when I had the chance!

22:09.453 --> 22:10.746
I should've killed you
when I had the chance!

22:10.830 --> 22:13.165
I should've killed you
when I had the chance!

22:14.792 --> 22:18.796
You idiot.

22:18.879 --> 22:22.091
You idiot!

22:24.134 --> 22:25.177
Damn it.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.639
No matter what I do...

22:29.431 --> 22:30.891
I'm surrounded by idiots!

22:33.644 --> 22:36.272
TO BE CONTINUED

22:37.439 --> 22:40.484
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

22:40.568 --> 22:43.821
<i>I'll trade it</i>

22:43.904 --> 22:49.076
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

22:50.244 --> 22:56.500
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

22:56.625 --> 23:02.214
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

23:02.965 --> 23:07.094
<i>You can see them all</i>

23:09.388 --> 23:13.809
<i>When you come to my house</i>

23:13.892 --> 23:19.940
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

23:20.024 --> 23:22.151
<i>While the wind blows</i>

23:22.234 --> 23:26.488
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

23:28.616 --> 23:34.872
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

23:34.955 --> 23:41.253
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

23:41.337 --> 23:47.217
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

23:47.801 --> 23:50.512
<i>"Be my friend</i>

23:50.596 --> 23:57.394
<i>Always"</i>
