- How was the dinner?
- Plant-based.

32:04.792 --> 32:07.012
Um, I got homework, so...

32:07.055 --> 32:08.622
- Hey.
I thought...

32:08.665 --> 32:12.060
maybe next weekend we could,
like, go to the movies?

32:12.104 --> 32:14.628
You know, buy one ticket
and then sneak into five?

32:14.671 --> 32:16.282
- I think I might go
to Dad's again.

32:16.325 --> 32:18.284
- You were just there.

32:18.327 --> 32:20.112
- I know, but I have
a school thing.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.287
- Oh.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.158
Sick.
Can I come?

32:23.202 --> 32:26.640
- It's sort of
not for parents.

32:29.991 --> 32:32.515
- Yeah, no, that's--that's
totally cool.

32:32.559 --> 32:35.910
- But I'm still totally down
for the movie thing.

for your, uh...

33:25.394 --> 33:28.484
- Got a little girl
in Cincinnati.

33:28.528 --> 33:31.792

for her birthdays.

33:35.230 --> 33:37.145

It's better this way.

33:56.991 --> 33:59.167
- So?

34:04.781 --> 34:08.089
- So it really shouldn't be
her prints on that gun.

a lot about it.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.475
- I'll bet you have.

35:31.607 --> 35:35.045
- It's hard to wrap your
brain around, actually...

35:35.089 --> 35:36.264
that each of our fingerprints

35:36.308 --> 35:39.267
is totally
and completely unique.

And tiger stripes.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.447

35:46.970 --> 35:49.364
but it really works out
in my favor.

Forgot one.

I've got the original
somewhere safe.

Let me know what the cops say.

into almost every one of these.

What did the specialist say?

37:03.612 --> 37:06.006

want some of this.

37:27.984 --> 37:29.421
- But he's in second grade.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.511
- Yeah.

Oh, but the dye still needs
to dry in the Chut Thais,

Yes, I am feeling much better.

- Your target.

Although, by this point, he's
gonna die of old age first.

how they're made,

that works is if the plan
