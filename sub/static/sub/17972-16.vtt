who claims
I "stole" her money.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.329
That's right. How'd you know?
I've seen this ruse before.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.532
I told you we should've
got the surgery.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.534
That would've
sold this thing.

19:30.536 --> 19:33.187
Look, it's not my fault your
ugly mother was dumb enough

19:33.189 --> 19:34.622
to think
she could be a model.

19:34.624 --> 19:35.823
[CHUCKLES]

19:35.825 --> 19:38.493
Anyway,
what I did was totally legal.

19:38.495 --> 19:40.261
There's nothing
you can do about it.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.763
Oh, yeah? There's one thing
I can do about it.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.865
Hold my purse.

19:44.867 --> 19:46.801
[GRUNTING]

19:46.803 --> 19:48.969
The challenger
takes a vicious left.

19:48.971 --> 19:51.472
And another left.
Or maybe that's a right.

19:51.474 --> 19:52.940
I don't know which is which.

19:52.942 --> 19:56.744
But things are heating up here
in the brawl at the mall.

19:56.746 --> 20:00.048
The conflagration
by the yogurt station.

20:00.050 --> 20:02.550
The war by the Apple Store.

20:02.552 --> 20:05.386
The uppercut
by the Sunglass Hut.

20:05.388 --> 20:07.771
Rallo, I told you
to stay in the hot car.

20:07.773 --> 20:10.408
Wait, stop.
Whose kid is that?

20:10.410 --> 20:12.209
Kind of mine. Why?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.212
Are you kidding me? The hair.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.547
The voice.
The wise-beyond-his-ageness.

20:16.549 --> 20:20.017
I've seen it many times before
and it always works.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.386
What are you talking about,
Barry?

20:22.388 --> 20:24.722
See?
He makes a good case.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.326
You know, I'm kind of a comedy
snob, and he does make me laugh.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.228
Why don't they make
high heels for dudes?

20:30.230 --> 20:32.213
You have no reason
to trust me,

20:32.215 --> 20:35.950
but I am a real agent and this
kid's got something special.

20:35.952 --> 20:37.551
And if you
let me work with him,

20:37.553 --> 20:40.554
I can make us all
a lot of money.

20:40.556 --> 20:42.473
I don't know.
Come on, Dad.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.175
He's probably not
gonna scam us again.

20:45.177 --> 20:48.646
I can't believe
he scammed us again.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.248
I don't wanna think about

20:50.250 --> 20:52.016
how I'm gonna pay for this
barrel rental.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.386
I got it. We'll tell Roberta
we can make her a model.

[ALL LAUGH]

20:56.956 --> 20:58.456
Ow, I got a splinter
in my wiener.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.823
I know, right?

20:59.825 --> 21:01.025
FREIGHT TRAIN:
I got them too.
