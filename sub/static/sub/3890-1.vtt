<i>Da-eun, take a step</i>

01:26.553 --> 01:30.091
<i>That's yucky
Please get up</i>

01:31.825 --> 01:32.963
<i>Da-eun</i>

01:34.227 --> 01:37.504
<i>Da-eun
Here's a butterfly</i>

01:38.698 --> 01:41.542
<i>That's my beautiful baby girl
Do you love daddy?</i>

01:42.469 --> 01:43.573
<i>My heart</i>

02:10.163 --> 02:11.164
<i>Da-eun</i>

02:12.899 --> 02:14.071
<i>Da-eun</i>

02:17.403 --> 02:18.575
<i>Da-eun</i>

02:18.938 --> 02:19.814
<i>Da-eun</i>

02:26.546 --> 02:27.490
<i>Da-eun</i>

02:36.589 --> 02:38.569
Da-eun, Da-eun

02:38.992 --> 02:41.860
I'm sorry
Have you seen Da-eun?

02:41.861 --> 02:42.931
Daddy

02:43.796 --> 02:44.740
<i>Da-eun</i>

02:46.299 --> 02:48.210
I'm sorry
I'm so late

02:48.668 --> 02:50.402
Daddy's really sorry

02:50.403 --> 02:52.007
I can't breathe

02:52.105 --> 02:53.311
Let go

02:54.941 --> 02:57.009
Why are you wet?

02:57.010 --> 02:59.320
I was looking for you

02:59.445 --> 03:01.948
You know how anxious
I get when I can't find you

03:02.048 --> 03:03.550
I'm not a baby

03:04.017 --> 03:06.327
By the way,
where did you get this umbrella?

03:06.419 --> 03:09.161
This man and woman
gave it to me

03:09.355 --> 03:12.529
I told you never to take
things from a stranger

03:12.725 --> 03:14.705
It's a crazy world out there

03:15.028 --> 03:17.975
Don't worry
I'm never going anywhere

03:18.097 --> 03:20.737
You can't live without me

03:21.801 --> 03:23.303
I really can't

03:23.703 --> 03:26.411
- What did daddy say that you're to daddy?
- I forgot

03:28.441 --> 03:29.942
I'm daddy's heart

03:29.943 --> 03:31.217
Daddy's heart

03:33.379 --> 03:36.053
Sweetie, are you sure
you're ready?

03:36.516 --> 03:38.518
Give me a tough one today

03:38.585 --> 03:40.826
One with tough spelling
and spacing

03:41.287 --> 03:42.265
<i>All right</i>

03:42.388 --> 03:43.594
You must get it right

03:44.891 --> 03:48.668
Next to the Ahyeon-dong overpass,

03:49.095 --> 03:50.699
in front of bakery,

03:51.030 --> 03:52.839
a trashcan

03:58.271 --> 04:01.252
Miss Jung Da-eun, is once again
being careless

04:09.015 --> 04:14.397
You see? You're so smart,
but you get clumsy and give up too early

04:14.520 --> 04:16.329
Say this to yourself in your head

04:16.422 --> 04:17.456
It ain't over

04:17.457 --> 04:18.457
'til it's over

04:18.458 --> 04:20.596
It ain't over 'til it's over

04:20.760 --> 04:22.797
It ain't over 'til it's over

04:22.929 --> 04:24.966
It ain't over 'til it's over

04:30.069 --> 04:33.642
<i>Daddy, I love you the best in the world
I'm gonna marry you</i>

04:42.749 --> 04:46.424
<i>Blood and Ties</i>

04:46.853 --> 04:50.323
<i>June 2013, Seoul</i>

04:50.690 --> 04:52.090
<i>D-15 before statute
of limitations expires</i>

04:52.091 --> 04:55.300
<i>Until the murderer is caught,
the story isn't over</i>

04:55.662 --> 04:58.370
<i>The Devil's Whisper
The true story of the Han Chae-jin abduction</i>

05:06.172 --> 05:08.516
I'll be there in an hour
Yes, sir

05:13.279 --> 05:15.088
Thank you and have a good day

05:17.216 --> 05:18.194
Be real

05:18.685 --> 05:21.461
This is a big social issue

05:21.788 --> 05:23.825
You know about the
Han Chae-jin abduction case?

05:24.190 --> 05:27.171
The statute of limitations on that case
is quickly running out

05:27.493 --> 05:32.101
What do you think about the statute of
limitations in criminal law?

05:32.598 --> 05:34.635
For felonies including

05:34.767 --> 05:37.969
murder and kidnapping committed
against women and children

05:37.970 --> 05:40.382
the statute of limitations
should be abolished

05:40.707 --> 05:45.281
I'd like to quote Numbers 32:23
from the Old Testament

05:45.445 --> 05:50.019
"You may be sure that
your sin will find you out"

05:50.283 --> 05:54.753
A child abductor and murderer
must receive the maximum penalty

05:54.754 --> 05:56.822
The statute of limitations

05:56.823 --> 05:59.429
must be abolished so that those
criminals can be punished

05:59.826 --> 06:01.533
That's quite extreme

06:01.761 --> 06:04.742
Does that mean they should
receive the death penalty?

06:08.434 --> 06:10.936
Currently, the death penalty is being
abolished in most international jurisdictions

06:10.937 --> 06:14.206
Korea has not carried out
a single execution since 1997

06:14.207 --> 06:16.949
In reality,
it's no longer practiced

06:17.176 --> 06:24.822
Yes. I still think they should
get the death penalty

06:25.184 --> 06:28.063
This is just a hunch,
but I think you'll pass this time

06:28.321 --> 06:30.301
I have to
I must

06:30.590 --> 06:33.625
Even if you pass
the interview round

06:33.626 --> 06:35.127
You'll still need to know someone
who can help you

06:35.128 --> 06:38.200
By any chance, does your dad
have any friends there?

06:38.698 --> 06:40.006
Da-eun?

06:41.667 --> 06:42.873
Daddy?

06:46.272 --> 06:47.945
Hey, Da-eun

06:48.374 --> 06:49.819
Daddy, did you not see me?

06:49.909 --> 06:52.583
I'm surprised to see you here

06:53.146 --> 06:55.023
I think our eyes met earlier

06:55.114 --> 06:56.457
No

06:56.816 --> 06:58.989
Daddy, I told you not to do that

06:59.118 --> 07:01.257
No, I really didn't see you

07:01.320 --> 07:04.233
It's hot outside
Have a cold drink before you go

07:04.490 --> 07:05.798
I'm all right

07:06.159 --> 07:07.297
Hello, sir

07:07.827 --> 07:08.965
Hello, sir

07:09.829 --> 07:11.396
Bo-ra, you've gotten prettier

07:11.397 --> 07:12.375
Right?

07:12.465 --> 07:13.231
Daddy

07:13.232 --> 07:14.734
This is my RoboCop,
Kim Jane-kyung

07:14.834 --> 07:15.904
RoboCop?

07:16.402 --> 07:19.404
Oh, your friend who's studying for
the police entrance exam

07:19.405 --> 07:24.718
It's an honor to meet you, sir

07:25.178 --> 07:27.679
Da-eun talked so much about you

07:27.680 --> 07:30.092
How you're so young,
handsome and cool

07:32.084 --> 07:35.065
From here on,
I'll protect Da-eun

07:35.455 --> 07:38.368
No thanks
I'll protect Da-eun

07:38.458 --> 07:39.436
Pardon?

07:40.860 --> 07:42.100
I'm joking

07:43.062 --> 07:43.699
Mister

07:44.530 --> 07:46.198
Move the boxes over there, please

07:46.199 --> 07:47.269
Yes, ma'am

07:49.402 --> 07:50.540
It was nice seeing you

07:50.736 --> 07:52.579
Please take good care
of my Da-eun

07:52.672 --> 07:53.548
Yes, sir

08:03.749 --> 08:04.887
Were you surprised?

08:09.021 --> 08:10.432
That's very clean

08:23.035 --> 08:26.414
Da-eun, it's time
Give them a call

08:27.039 --> 08:28.074
okay

08:35.581 --> 08:37.890
<i>Please enter
your applicant ID number</i>

08:40.986 --> 08:44.867
<i>I'm sorry
You did not pass this time</i>

08:44.957 --> 08:47.733
<i>Please try again next time</i>

08:48.261 --> 08:49.296
What did they say?

08:56.536 --> 09:00.712
Hello. This is applicant ID 144,
Jung Da-eun

09:00.806 --> 09:04.219
I'd like to find out the reasons
for failing the interview

09:04.844 --> 09:08.792
I didn't make any mistakes
during the final interview

09:09.815 --> 09:10.885
Pardon?

09:11.284 --> 09:13.184
Shouldn't the company
be clear and open

09:13.185 --> 09:14.823
about the evaluation process?

09:15.855 --> 09:16.890
Hello?

09:17.523 --> 09:18.661
Hello?

09:19.926 --> 09:21.059
Da-eun, stop

09:21.060 --> 09:22.471
Give it back

09:22.595 --> 09:23.972
Just stop

09:24.196 --> 09:25.504
It's not your fault

09:26.732 --> 09:30.043
If you pass the interview round,
they look at your personal information

09:30.503 --> 09:34.005
I don't have a decent job

09:34.006 --> 09:36.850
What about your job?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.647
It's not because of that

09:40.780 --> 09:43.727
I didn't like this company anyway

09:45.017 --> 09:46.587
I got one more to go

09:47.787 --> 09:48.925
You know?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.270
Mr. Soon-man

10:03.502 --> 10:06.415
How about we compete
for one week's dish-washing?

10:09.008 --> 10:11.249
You always lose
but still dare to challenge me

10:11.344 --> 10:14.086
Hush
It'll be different this time

10:16.048 --> 10:19.757
<i>Spicy hot seafood noodles
that will fire you up</i>

10:19.852 --> 10:20.922
Go

10:36.335 --> 10:37.439
I quit

10:49.582 --> 10:51.750
How would you have lived
without your daughter?

10:51.751 --> 10:53.992
I couldn't have
She's my whole heart

10:54.286 --> 10:56.232
You see, my Da-eun has

10:56.355 --> 10:58.062
a TOEIC score of 930

10:58.157 --> 11:01.570
- and level 1 grade for Korean Language Test
- With a pretty face and a great body

11:01.694 --> 11:04.470
She's a good daughter and has graduated
with honors from her grad school

11:04.597 --> 11:07.043
Whew
I can memorize them all now

11:07.800 --> 11:10.144
My Da-eun is going to
be a reporter

11:10.236 --> 11:11.670
<i>Killed by a neighbor</i>

11:11.671 --> 11:16.916
<i>Do you know what you have clone?</i>

11:17.510 --> 11:19.820
<i>Grotesque serial killing</i>

11:20.312 --> 11:22.724
<i>Millionaire killed by his wife</i>

11:22.948 --> 11:26.327
<i>The Devil's Whisper
The true story of the Han Chae-jin abduction</i>

11:28.554 --> 11:29.589
Fish stew?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.134
I'll eat tomorrow

11:32.124 --> 11:34.502
Yes. Interviewers always
ask this type of stuff

11:34.593 --> 11:37.369
This movie is a big issue
because of the statute of limitations

11:54.013 --> 11:55.253
<i>How did it go?</i>

12:00.753 --> 12:02.130
<i>Our baby, Min-sew</i>

12:06.726 --> 12:10.435
<i>He's not coming back</i>

12:14.133 --> 12:14.907
<i>Honey</i>

12:15.034 --> 12:15.944
<i>Honey</i>

12:16.368 --> 12:17.969
<i>Don't you do this to me</i>

12:17.970 --> 12:21.417
<i>- I can't live on like this
- Honey</i>

12:23.676 --> 12:26.978
<i>- Min-sew won't come back
- I can'! live</i>

12:26.979 --> 12:28.980
<i>Let's all die together</i>

12:28.981 --> 12:30.585
<i>Honey, please</i>

12:32.785 --> 12:34.886
<i>This is the actual voice of
Han Chae-jin's abductor from 1998</i>

12:34.887 --> 12:36.264
<i>This is the actual voice of

12:37.056 --> 12:40.435
<i>The kid has a stomachache

12:41.560 --> 12:45.440
<i>Are you getting mad at me?</i>

12:46.465 --> 12:47.876
<i>Shut up</i>

12:49.201 --> 12:50.805
<i>What are you doing?</i>

12:51.070 --> 12:53.243
<i>Don't you care
what happens to your son?</i>

12:54.974 --> 12:56.715
<i>You want Chae-jin to die?</i>

12:57.209 --> 12:58.415
<i>Shut up</i>

12:58.978 --> 13:01.219
<i>You're hurting my ears</i>

13:03.182 --> 13:05.662
<i>From now on,
until I get the money</i>

13:06.018 --> 13:08.123
<i>The boy will starve</i>

13:09.221 --> 13:11.292
<i>Have you given up already?</i>

13:11.724 --> 13:13.431
<i>What did I tell you?</i>

13:14.193 --> 13:17.663
<i>It ain't over 'til it's over</i>

13:20.599 --> 13:22.567
<i>It ain't over 'til it's over</i>

13:22.568 --> 13:25.572
<i>Hurry and come
if you want to save your son</i>

13:43.155 --> 13:46.762
The movie is over
but I still feel terrible

13:47.026 --> 13:49.006
The kidnapper is
the devil himself

13:49.094 --> 13:51.329
His voice is really creepy

13:51.330 --> 13:52.997
Why can't the police
just catch him?

13:52.998 --> 13:54.165
I know

13:54.166 --> 13:56.701
If he thought about his own family,
he couldn't have done it

13:56.702 --> 13:58.306
I'm getting goose bumps

14:04.543 --> 14:06.989
Bo-ra, I was thinking

14:07.079 --> 14:10.686
The kidnapper's voice is public
yet he's still on the loose

14:10.816 --> 14:14.423
He must've skipped the country
or gotten vocal cord surgery

14:15.120 --> 14:18.727
The kidnapper's family would
certainly recognize his voice

14:19.058 --> 14:22.039
What do you all think?
Do you think he's still alive?

14:22.294 --> 14:24.570
I don't know

14:24.697 --> 14:27.644
But that voice is so familiar

14:27.733 --> 14:30.301
- I just can't remember whose it is
- Who is it?

14:30.302 --> 14:31.102
Think very hard

14:31.103 --> 14:35.210
- Do you know how much the reward is?
- Wait a second

14:36.108 --> 14:37.143
Holy cow

14:37.409 --> 14:39.477
Da-eun, I'm sorry

14:39.478 --> 14:43.314
- Doesn't Da-eun's dad sound like the killer?
- What are you saying?

14:43.315 --> 14:44.521
You're insane

14:45.117 --> 14:48.587
Bo-ra, that's absurd

14:49.355 --> 14:54.325
What?
Don't get so mad

14:54.326 --> 14:57.170
- I didn't say that your dad did it
- Stop it

14:59.865 --> 15:01.071
Great job

- Shut up

15:51.750 --> 15:53.127
<i>What are you doing?</i>

16:07.433 --> 16:08.571

16:11.437 --> 16:12.643
What?

16:12.705 --> 16:14.241
What are you doing up?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.977
I was surfing the net

16:18.277 --> 16:20.257
Why are you lying?

16:21.847 --> 16:24.293
What do you mean?

16:24.650 --> 16:28.564
You want Chae-jin to die?
Hurry and move

16:52.678 --> 16:54.658
What's wrong?
Is it no good?

16:56.081 --> 16:59.255
I stayed up all night
and don't have any appetite

16:59.618 --> 17:00.858
I'm going back to bed

17:09.328 --> 17:10.932

15 years ago, the tragic death of a boy
saddened the entire nation</i>

17:43.495 --> 17:45.363
<i>D-10
After the release
of The Devil's Whisper,</i>

17:45.364 --> 17:48.607
<i>the kidnapper's voice went public
and many reports have been made</i>

17:48.734 --> 17:50.701
<i>The police have set up
a special (ask force</i>

17:50.702 --> 17:53.444
<i>trying to close in
on the kidnapper's whereabouts</i>

17:53.505 --> 17:56.418
<i>We're trying to focus
on finding the culprit</i>

17:56.875 --> 18:00.618
<i>However, after the film's release,
many people called in with false reports,</i>

18:00.746 --> 18:02.987
<i>which are actually causing
confusion for the investigation</i>

18:03.215 --> 18:05.183
<i>We please ask that everyone
think carefully before making a call</i>

18:05.184 --> 18:07.485
I was thinking last night

18:07.486 --> 18:09.466
And I think
I was crazy yesterday

18:09.555 --> 18:13.024
You know when I get like
that sometimes

18:13.025 --> 18:16.871
I should rip my mouth off

18:17.262 --> 18:18.468
I'm sorry

18:18.964 --> 18:22.241
It's okay
I was overly sensitive too

18:22.634 --> 18:24.011
I'm sorry that I got angry

18:24.103 --> 18:25.377
This isn't the time to
fool around

18:25.904 --> 18:29.078
You've got dark circles down
to your chin

18:29.208 --> 18:30.186
Eat up

18:30.375 --> 18:31.410
This looks delicious

18:31.910 --> 18:34.812
The truth is there's no
better father than your dad

18:34.813 --> 18:37.123
He's so sweet to you

18:37.282 --> 18:38.625
We were so crazy

18:38.851 --> 18:41.419
But I understand
Remember my dad's affair?

18:41.420 --> 18:44.833
The moment I started doubting
that my dad was unfaithful,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.569
I went insane

18:46.992 --> 18:49.836
So what happened?

18:54.867 --> 18:57.168
<i>I looked through
his cell phone first</i>

18:57.169 --> 18:58.580
<i>My Heart</i>

18:59.905 --> 19:02.852
<i>He had so many business cards
of bar hostesses</i>

19:03.041 --> 19:05.112
<i>He even had loyalty cards
for motels</i>

19:07.112 --> 19:12.118
<i>He's over 50 and he has Facebook</i>

19:12.851 --> 19:15.627
<i>He was so busy meeting those
young girls from Facebook</i>

19:15.754 --> 19:17.859
<i>My precious</i>

19:33.939 --> 19:37.386
It's okay
I understand

19:38.510 --> 19:41.821
I didn't do it

19:42.681 --> 19:44.388
Are you sure
you didn't download it?

19:44.750 --> 19:48.163
Maybe it was already on the computer
when we bought it

19:49.988 --> 19:51.092
Are you serious?

19:58.664 --> 20:01.933
It's true
Your dad is a man

20:01.934 --> 20:03.971
He's still young at heart

20:04.069 --> 20:06.345
I know he has his male needs

20:07.039 --> 20:08.950
<i>Have you followed him before?</i>

20:09.241 --> 20:13.383
<i>You said he goes fishing on weekends
and come home empty-handed</i>

Girls, get in

21:04.563 --> 21:05.769
Please wait

21:09.401 --> 21:13.349
I think you've had a lot to drink
Do you have a designated driver?

21:13.972 --> 21:15.883
No thanks
I can drive myself

21:16.241 --> 21:18.949
No, it's dangerous
You should call someone

21:19.211 --> 21:21.714
What do you care?

21:21.847 --> 21:25.750
I have a daughter your age
and I'm worried

21:25.751 --> 21:28.163
Worry about your own daughter
Give me my car keys

21:28.353 --> 21:29.491
Hurry

21:29.721 --> 21:30.563
Give them to me

21:30.822 --> 21:31.926
Give them to me

21:33.692 --> 21:36.502
Why are you
fucking pissing me off?

21:39.364 --> 21:40.968
What?

21:41.333 --> 21:42.099
What?

21:42.100 --> 21:43.101
HEY

21:43.835 --> 21:45.815
Who are you?

21:46.238 --> 21:47.546
That's my father

21:49.074 --> 21:51.782
So you two work in pairs

21:52.811 --> 21:54.950
Apologize to him right now

21:55.047 --> 21:57.186
Bitch, are you crazy?

21:59.985 --> 22:03.023
Da-eun, don't do this
Daddy is fine

22:03.155 --> 22:05.465
<i>Da-eun</i>

22:05.724 --> 22:08.136
- Stop this
- Da-eun, what are you doing?

22:15.701 --> 22:17.442
Don't drink and drive next time

22:17.536 --> 22:19.106
And you, don't get hot-headed

22:19.204 --> 22:23.741
I never curse, but she suddenly
took my keys and hit me

22:23.742 --> 22:25.278
I can file a motion
for summary judgment

22:25.544 --> 22:27.011
You wanna go to jail?

22:27.012 --> 22:29.980
Can't you just punish her
and send me home?

22:29.981 --> 22:32.052
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

22:32.451 --> 22:35.796
This is all my fault
My daughter is innocent

22:35.921 --> 22:38.128
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

22:46.932 --> 22:48.434
Lean on me

23:19.898 --> 23:20.933
Does this feel good?

23:21.032 --> 23:22.010
Yeah

23:27.305 --> 23:31.310
When did you get
so much gray hair?

23:31.676 --> 23:34.282
I guess you don't see
yourself in the mirror often

23:34.880 --> 23:36.052
Why should I?

23:37.149 --> 23:39.652
Don't just rely on
your good looks

23:40.919 --> 23:50.601
I want to be
a 16 year old boy again

23:50.729 --> 23:53.232
And do what?
You want to get remarried?

23:53.565 --> 23:57.775
What free time do I have?
You alone take up most of my time

23:57.936 --> 23:59.540
If it's hard,
then don't do it

24:00.105 --> 24:03.951
No way
You're my reason for living

24:05.644 --> 24:08.488
Daddy, your lies sound so genuine

24:08.747 --> 24:10.522
I'm not lying

24:12.451 --> 24:15.052
Da-eun, let's practice
your interview

24:15.053 --> 24:17.158
No thanks
It's embarrassing

24:17.389 --> 24:20.336
Ms. Jung, why do you want to
become a reporter?

24:55.160 --> 24:57.265
Jung Soon-man's

24:59.631 --> 25:01.838
Daughter, Da-eun

25:02.501 --> 25:05.675
26 years old
Finished grad school

25:07.239 --> 25:09.014
Who are you?

25:10.408 --> 25:12.081
Who should I say that I am?

25:13.144 --> 25:14.646
I'm just a person
who knows a bit about things

25:18.984 --> 25:20.964
I'm not a scary person

25:21.620 --> 25:24.226
The real scary person is
somewhere else

25:26.424 --> 25:28.461
Who are you?

25:29.160 --> 25:30.969
Me?
I'm Shim

25:32.998 --> 25:35.274
Please give this to your dad

25:37.903 --> 25:40.406
It's Shim
As in the Chinese character for heart

25:48.580 --> 25:51.083
Shim?
I'm not sure

25:51.449 --> 25:53.451
Can you text me the number?

25:55.754 --> 25:57.062
Don't worry

26:01.393 --> 26:05.864
<i>General
Long time no see</i>

26:06.898 --> 26:08.104
Why did you come back?

26:08.266 --> 26:13.978
<i>I moved back to Korea for good
My sister is dying</i>

26:14.339 --> 26:16.751
<i>She's got pancreatic cancer</i>

26:17.809 --> 26:20.016
<i>But I don't have any money
to pay for the hospital bill</i>

26:21.346 --> 26:24.850
You promised never to
show up again

26:25.283 --> 26:26.450
I've given you enough

26:26.451 --> 26:29.261
<i>Really?
I don't remember</i>

26:30.355 --> 26:34.861
Anyway, your daughter
has grown up beautifully

26:35.594 --> 26:39.667
<i>How shocked would she be
to hear about her dead mother?</i>

26:41.499 --> 26:45.037
If you come near Da-eun again

26:45.136 --> 26:48.174
<i>Are you getting mad at me?</i>

26:48.940 --> 26:51.113
<i>Are you fucking crazy?</i>

<i>You know I've got temper
If you don't send the money by tomorrow,</i>

26:57.482 --> 26:58.654
it's over

27:14.265 --> 27:16.800
We need wine
Dad, I'll be upstairs

27:16.801 --> 27:17.677
okay

27:27.579 --> 27:29.752
<i>3 clays have passed. Aren't you afraid?

27:34.219 --> 27:36.062
<i>Just wait</i>

27:57.842 --> 27:58.946
Let's start

28:17.529 --> 28:19.941
Should we light the candles
starting this year?

28:20.632 --> 28:22.942
You always ask the same thing

28:23.435 --> 28:25.437
I feel sorry to mom
I don't want to

28:25.537 --> 28:27.346
I don't deserve it

28:27.806 --> 28:29.683
You're so stubborn

28:30.775 --> 28:34.188
Just do as we've always done it
I'm gonna blow them out

28:47.625 --> 28:48.797

28:50.361 --> 28:53.501
Jung Soon-man
Come out here right now

28:54.632 --> 28:56.305
Before I set the house on fire

28:57.435 --> 29:00.541
I know you're in there
Come crawling out

29:01.773 --> 29:03.013
You think I'm joking?

29:03.675 --> 29:07.282
Is that little money worth
losing your daughter over?

29:07.378 --> 29:09.813
It's him, Shim
Isn't it?

29:09.814 --> 29:12.282
- Should I reveal who you really are?
- What's wrong with him?

29:12.283 --> 29:14.388
Does he have something on you?

29:14.486 --> 29:16.086
- Let's all go down together
- He's got nothing on me

29:16.087 --> 29:17.293
Go to your room

29:19.824 --> 29:22.159

29:25.130 --> 29:26.438
What are you doing?

29:28.900 --> 29:30.345
Excuse me

29:30.802 --> 29:32.372
Are you gonna be stubborn like that?

29:32.670 --> 29:33.910
I'll do as you wish

29:35.106 --> 29:37.882
Hey sweetie,
I'll tell you a funny story

29:38.109 --> 29:40.282
about the real Jung Soon-man

29:40.512 --> 29:42.753
Do you know what your dad did
to your mom?

29:42.847 --> 29:46.216
Your dad's nickname is fucking
Mr. Three-star Man

29:46.217 --> 29:47.584
Mr. Three-star General

29:47.585 --> 29:48.485
Let's talk outside

29:48.486 --> 29:49.692
Fucking let go

29:51.723 --> 29:52.997
What are all these?

29:53.491 --> 29:55.025
Is this a memorial service
for your wife?

29:55.026 --> 29:56.096
Get inside

29:56.194 --> 29:59.835
Your dad must have
a guilty fucking conscience

30:00.064 --> 30:01.099
Stop right now

30:01.800 --> 30:03.074
Let go of me

30:07.572 --> 30:08.482
Is this fun?

30:08.573 --> 30:10.018
Is this fun living like this?

30:10.275 --> 30:12.312
I'll fucking make
your life a living hell

30:12.443 --> 30:13.547
For money or not,
I'll tell all

30:15.713 --> 30:19.525
If you come around here again,

30:21.753 --> 30:23.130
you could die

30:36.267 --> 30:38.941
The pretty daughter
seems shocked

30:42.774 --> 30:44.310
Be good to me

Can you find criminal records for this man
and a death certificate for this woman?

32:58.309 --> 32:59.810
How do I do that?

32:59.811 --> 33:04.055
I'm sure there's someone from your

How can we find
a kidnapper from 15 years ago?

34:36.574 --> 34:39.350
Many people called in after they
saw the film, but they're no good

Larceny, assault, fraud

35:09.273 --> 35:10.274
He's a three-star

We usually call this type of criminal,
a common criminal

35:16.214 --> 35:18.785
Is there anything else?

35:20.017 --> 35:22.998
Seeing that he doesn't have
anything after 1985,

35:23.387 --> 35:25.924
I'm sure he's doing what he does best
somewhere else

35:26.023 --> 35:28.833
These criminals don't change

35:29.026 --> 35:31.131
They continue to live this way
until they die

35:31.229 --> 35:33.231
They can never be rehabilitated

35:34.232 --> 35:36.735
From my police instinct,

35:36.834 --> 35:40.805
the moment you asked me to do this,
I had this gut feeling

35:41.906 --> 35:43.476
Are you leaving already?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.019
Don't you want to hear
about Shim Mi-ok?

35:48.880 --> 35:51.588
She's not dead
She's still alive

35:51.716 --> 35:52.922
This is her address

35:54.719 --> 35:58.098
Are you sure that she's not
someone with the same name?

36:01.459 --> 36:04.235
<i>Dearest Daddy</i>

36:04.662 --> 36:06.767

37:19.904 --> 37:21.247
I think someone's here

37:33.150 --> 37:34.128
What's wrong?

37:36.354 --> 37:37.697
Do you know him?

37:41.926 --> 37:43.132
Do you wanna go in?

37:43.894 --> 37:44.998
Wait

37:51.102 --> 37:53.082
He came out

38:14.725 --> 38:15.669
Be careful

38:27.204 --> 38:28.012
Hurry

38:29.240 --> 38:30.218
Hurry and follow him

38:41.319 --> 38:42.389
Where did he go?

39:15.486 --> 39:16.487
Hey, brother

39:17.021 --> 39:19.900
Your pretty daughter
came to see my sister

39:20.958 --> 39:23.268
But she's really angry right now

39:23.794 --> 39:26.070
I'm scared of her
Please come and take her

39:27.064 --> 39:28.270
What?

39:28.499 --> 39:30.266
Of course I didn't
fucking tell her

39:30.267 --> 39:31.905
We're on the same side now

39:32.436 --> 39:33.710
Get over here right now

39:38.642 --> 39:40.053
My mom's still alive,
isn't she?

39:41.545 --> 39:43.456
You found out?

39:43.781 --> 39:46.694
Fuck, how am I gonna
make money now?

39:46.984 --> 39:49.294
And you know why
my dad hid it from me

39:50.254 --> 39:53.701
I don't know
Maybe he's got a guilty conscience

39:55.192 --> 39:58.173
Let me see my mom

39:58.829 --> 40:03.073
Just keep on believing that she's dead
and go on with your life

40:04.034 --> 40:05.377
I want to see her

40:06.303 --> 40:08.909
<i>Shim Mi-ok</i>

40:11.675 --> 40:13.177
What are you doing?
Come inside

40:13.711 --> 40:15.156
I thought you wanted to see her

41:01.592 --> 41:04.163
Don't you have to go home?

41:06.464 --> 41:09.877
Is there something else?

41:10.234 --> 41:11.679
What?

41:15.473 --> 41:16.884
The kid has a stomachache

41:16.974 --> 41:18.783
<i>- He's asking for his mom
- What's this?</i>

41:19.276 --> 41:22.712
<i>Are you getting mad at me?</i>

41:22.713 --> 41:23.885
You know who this is

41:23.981 --> 41:27.450
<i>Shut up
What are you doing?</i>

41:27.451 --> 41:28.551
Is that Soon-man?

41:28.552 --> 41:30.862
<i>Don't you care

41:32.523 --> 41:34.161
<i>You want Chae-jin to die?</i>

41:34.625 --> 41:36.036
<i>Shut up</i>

41:36.494 --> 41:38.735
- You're hurting my ears
- Wait a second

41:38.863 --> 41:39.967
Maybe it's not him

41:47.838 --> 41:49.010
Let's go

41:50.708 --> 41:52.881
Let's go
Listen to me

41:52.977 --> 41:54.081
Let go of me

41:54.912 --> 41:57.947
She abandoned her own child
She doesn't deserve to be a mom

41:57.948 --> 42:00.622
Is that why you've killed
this living person from my memory?

42:03.153 --> 42:04.757
Those terrifying eyes

42:05.990 --> 42:08.231
It must've been hard to hide them
all these years

42:23.507 --> 42:24.611
<i>Da-eun</i>

42:36.120 --> 42:37.098
<i>Da-eun</i>

42:38.689 --> 42:39.667

42:40.991 --> 42:42.061
<i>Da-eun</i>

43:24.868 --> 43:26.074
<i>Da-eun</i>

43:30.441 --> 43:34.082
I thought you'd be happier
if you didn't know

43:36.547 --> 43:40.120
I wanted to show you
only the beautiful things

43:42.853 --> 43:45.959
I did it all for you

43:52.830 --> 43:53.934
I know

43:55.199 --> 43:58.442
But I'm scared

44:07.811 --> 44:09.222
<i>What are you doing?</i>

44:09.613 --> 44:11.615
<i>Don't you care

44:11.715 --> 44:14.696
<i>Hurry and come

44:15.819 --> 44:18.629
His laugh is exactly like yours

44:18.956 --> 44:22.836
Is it?
Maybe

44:23.260 --> 44:26.036
You know the phrase
you always tell me

44:26.363 --> 44:27.842
It ain't over

44:28.065 --> 44:29.408
'til it's over

44:32.403 --> 44:36.215
<i>It ain't over 'til it's over</i>

44:45.916 --> 44:47.589
You don't think...

44:47.751 --> 44:48.855
IS it 'you?

44:51.021 --> 44:56.334
Yogi Berra said that
You know that

44:57.494 --> 44:59.565
I'm sorry for doubting you

45:00.264 --> 45:02.437
But I want to hear from you

45:02.833 --> 45:05.211
And don't lie to me this time

45:05.335 --> 45:08.748
How could you do this to me?

45:09.306 --> 45:11.650
Even if you say you did it,
I can't report you

45:11.742 --> 45:14.723
So relax and
tell me the truth

45:15.979 --> 45:17.253
IS it 'you?

45:17.681 --> 45:19.558
No, it's not

45:21.118 --> 45:25.624
Why are you doing this to me?

45:27.491 --> 45:30.700
Are you telling the truth?
You really didn't do it?

45:31.962 --> 45:33.498
No

45:40.204 --> 45:44.175
I don't think you are either

45:44.475 --> 45:45.954
I hope you're not

45:54.418 --> 45:57.954
D-4
Who got this call
about Jung Soon-man?

45:57.955 --> 45:59.798
D-4
I did

46:00.124 --> 46:01.831
Who called him in?

46:02.593 --> 46:03.359
Why?

46:03.360 --> 46:04.494
He's got three convictions

46:04.495 --> 46:06.729
and he's got medical records
at Dr. Han's clinic

46:06.730 --> 46:07.930
His wife miscarried
at the clinic

46:07.931 --> 46:10.844
Who called him in?
What about his voice?

46:15.806 --> 46:17.217
There's no more

46:19.409 --> 46:20.888
Don't do this to me

46:23.847 --> 46:26.794
Show me your talent
like in the past

46:28.185 --> 46:31.598
You brought me $100,000
really fast before

46:34.858 --> 46:37.634
If you can't,
then fucking sell your house

46:41.932 --> 46:44.105
Hey, you haven't seen
this in a while

46:47.704 --> 46:49.012
You bastard

46:49.306 --> 46:50.876
What?
Why did I turn out this way?

46:51.809 --> 46:54.619
Why is my sister dying in pain?

47:00.317 --> 47:01.387
<i>All right</i>

47:02.486 --> 47:04.932
Move her to
a new hospital first

47:21.839 --> 47:27.118
I've always hated losing,
ever since I was a kid

47:28.812 --> 47:33.090
But there was one thing
that I had no control over

47:33.483 --> 47:34.587
Mom

47:36.987 --> 47:39.331
The kids always made fun of me

47:39.890 --> 47:42.598
But that day, I couldn't
hold back any longer

47:43.360 --> 47:45.863
So I beat them, badly

47:46.496 --> 47:50.444
But my dad believed me

47:50.567 --> 47:52.602
and said my daughter would
never do such thing

47:52.603 --> 47:56.710
He told those kids who hit me
to come out

48:00.377 --> 48:02.948
I was so embarrassed

48:04.181 --> 48:09.529
So when I came home,
I cried, yelling at him

48:10.354 --> 48:12.960
I told him never to come
to my school

48:13.056 --> 48:14.330
Never

48:16.059 --> 48:23.443
Then my dad said he was sorry

48:28.605 --> 48:34.487
He said he was sorry

48:46.723 --> 48:49.602
That's the kind of person
my dad is

49:01.171 --> 49:03.973
<i>4 clays remain before the
statute of limitations expires</i>

49:03.974 --> 49:06.909
<i>on the Han abduction case</i>

49:06.910 --> 49:09.390
<i>We met the father at
his child's murder scene</i>

49:09.513 --> 49:13.282
<i>He put my baby Chae-jin in this bag
and tossed it in the river</i>

49:13.283 --> 49:16.585
<i>Han Sang-sew
Han Chae-jin's father</i>

49:16.586 --> 49:21.001
<i>This was where
my baby was found</i>

49:21.925 --> 49:26.271
<i>I can spot right away
when I hear someone's voice</i>

49:26.496 --> 49:29.534
<i>If I recognize the voice,
he's the killer</i>

49:30.434 --> 49:32.812
<i>There's no doubt</i>

49:38.475 --> 49:41.388
<i>Maternity Notes
Dr. Han Sang-soc Ob/Gyn Clinic</i>

49:44.114 --> 49:45.491
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

49:46.516 --> 49:47.859
<i>Hello</i>

49:49.219 --> 49:53.065
<i>Are you getting mad at me?</i>

49:59.396 --> 50:02.104
<i>Kwang-min</i>

50:02.332 --> 50:03.432
<i>Dr. Han Sang-sew Ob/Gyn Clinic</i>

50:03.433 --> 50:06.073
You said you were Jung Da-eun
a reporter from the Goryeo Daily News?

50:06.169 --> 50:07.273
Yes

50:07.504 --> 50:08.949
By any chance

50:09.272 --> 50:12.219
Do you remember
Mr. Jung Soon-man?

50:12.542 --> 50:13.714
Pardon?

50:14.745 --> 50:18.921
He's my father
and he talked a lot about you

50:19.249 --> 50:21.251
I was also born in this clinic

50:21.451 --> 50:23.328
Really?

50:23.954 --> 50:25.991
That's interesting
that we've already met

50:26.289 --> 50:29.759
But I can't recall a patient
by just a name

50:34.931 --> 50:36.035
Here

50:43.807 --> 50:46.378
I remember now

50:47.344 --> 50:50.848
But you weren't born here

50:50.981 --> 50:54.588
The mother had pre-eclampsia
and miscarried

50:55.886 --> 50:57.866
It's great that
they succeeded in the end

50:58.188 --> 51:00.099
He earnestly wished
for a child

51:01.758 --> 51:03.829
He must be happy now

51:04.528 --> 51:08.635
Because he has a beautiful
daughter like you

51:08.865 --> 51:11.436
<i>Who's Jung Soon-man? The real killer is?
Han abduction case</i>

51:23.046 --> 51:24.320
Who is Jung Soon-man?

51:24.648 --> 51:25.854
Who is he to you?

51:26.349 --> 51:28.829
I don't know him

51:29.019 --> 51:31.795
How about his voice?
Is it similar?

51:31.888 --> 51:33.629
I really don't know

51:34.391 --> 51:36.098
I was doing someone else a favor

51:36.193 --> 51:39.902
So who is the person
who asked for a favor?

51:40.697 --> 51:42.040
You'd better tell me straight

51:42.132 --> 51:43.907
Harboring a criminal
is a crime

51:45.235 --> 51:47.545
I thought you wanted to be
a police officer not a criminal

51:48.405 --> 51:50.214
Oh man

51:50.941 --> 51:54.150
Do you have anything else
other than the voice?

51:54.277 --> 51:58.191
I do have something else
He sent me a note with instructions

52:00.383 --> 52:03.057
But he didn't write it

52:04.421 --> 52:06.264
Then who wrote it?

52:06.523 --> 52:08.901
I had the handwriting
analyzed at the time,

52:08.992 --> 52:11.063
and it was
a primary school student's

52:12.863 --> 52:15.503
It could've been his own child
or a neighborhood kid

52:15.665 --> 52:17.906
He made someone else do it

52:19.536 --> 52:22.983
He made an innocent child
his accomplice

52:24.141 --> 52:25.711
He's the devil himself

52:30.147 --> 52:33.356
Please take this note
and put it on your paper

53:03.680 --> 53:05.717
<i>It was a
primary school student's</i>

53:06.149 --> 53:08.629
<i>His own child

53:09.052 --> 53:10.719
<i>He made someone else do it</i>

53:10.720 --> 53:13.030
<i>"Next to the Ahyeon-dong overpass"</i>

<i>Sweetie, are you sure
you're ready?</i>

53:20.530 --> 53:24.842
Give me a tough one today
One with tough spelling and spacing

53:59.803 --> 54:02.147
Da-eun, what's wrong?

54:03.940 --> 54:04.773
<i>Da-eun</i>

54:04.774 --> 54:07.812
Da-eun, what's wrong?

54:13.683 --> 54:17.256
How could you make
your own daughter do this?

54:17.654 --> 54:18.928
Do you call yourself a human?

54:19.256 --> 54:21.133
What's wrong with you?

54:23.326 --> 54:25.602
Look at this

54:25.962 --> 54:27.373
They're exactly the same

54:28.598 --> 54:30.339
Are you still going to
play innocent?

54:30.767 --> 54:32.178
This is my handwriting

54:32.602 --> 54:35.583
What is? What's wrong with you?
What's this?

54:35.672 --> 54:36.878
You don't know?

54:37.173 --> 54:39.619
You always tested me
on spelling

54:40.844 --> 54:45.190
I was so clueless
and I wrote down what you called out

54:45.515 --> 54:48.155
I never knew you would use it
for your filthy doing

54:48.652 --> 54:51.553
Why didn't you do it alone?
Why did you make me your accomplice?

54:51.554 --> 54:55.058
What are you talking about?
This was just spelling practice

54:55.759 --> 54:57.500
Look at it closely

54:57.794 --> 54:59.795
Many children have
similar handwriting

54:59.796 --> 55:02.242
Calm down
And look at it closely

55:02.365 --> 55:04.345
This is not your handwriting

55:04.434 --> 55:05.674
Okay

55:06.536 --> 55:07.913
Let's be cool

55:09.139 --> 55:10.641
Stay cool

55:11.474 --> 55:15.320
I'm going to take
this note to the police

55:15.779 --> 55:17.258
and report you

55:18.548 --> 55:21.654
It's too bad
You only had a few more days left

55:26.423 --> 55:29.802
Let's go to the hospital first

55:30.660 --> 55:32.435
Your hand is bleeding badly

55:32.796 --> 55:36.300
It's you, isn't it?

55:39.502 --> 55:43.143
<i>0-3 (Night)</i>

55:45.342 --> 55:47.015
Where's everyone?

55:47.811 --> 55:50.087

55:50.447 --> 55:52.723
I think the name was
Jung Soon-man

55:53.817 --> 55:55.728
Jung Soon-man?

56:06.229 --> 56:07.367
Who is it?

56:11.034 --> 56:12.570
What can I help you with?

56:12.669 --> 56:14.478
We're the police

56:15.638 --> 56:17.140
What can I do to help?

56:29.085 --> 56:30.587
You know me

56:32.389 --> 56:34.232
You know me, don't you?

56:34.557 --> 56:36.559

56:36.659 --> 56:38.696
Don't you remember me?

56:41.231 --> 56:45.543
Answer me
You're the killer, aren't you?

56:47.437 --> 56:49.041
What are you doing?

56:57.680 --> 56:59.915
Mr. Han, please don't

56:59.916 --> 57:02.829
- Please come out
- You can't do this

57:04.821 --> 57:06.528
Hold him back

57:06.856 --> 57:08.164
He's the guy

57:08.525 --> 57:10.368
I've heard his voice
hundreds of times a day

57:10.560 --> 57:13.939
I can tell just
by listening to him breathing

57:15.165 --> 57:16.371
You

57:16.800 --> 57:21.306
You know everything
That's why you came to see me

57:21.471 --> 57:23.712
- Get him out of here
- You're not a reporter

57:23.807 --> 57:27.254
She wrote the note
I'm certain of it

57:27.343 --> 57:29.414
Hurry and investigate

57:34.551 --> 57:37.395
Hurry up
Don't let him lose consciousness

57:45.228 --> 57:48.971
His brain and nervous system are okay
He'll survive

57:49.165 --> 57:50.508
When do you think he'll wake up?

57:50.867 --> 57:53.370
It differs from
patient to patient

57:53.770 --> 57:56.546
He'll be unconscious for
at least a day up to a few days

58:06.316 --> 58:07.454
I'm counting on you

58:14.724 --> 58:17.864
How did they know?

58:19.028 --> 58:20.371
Me?

58:23.533 --> 58:24.978
Oh that?

58:26.669 --> 58:28.945
When we looked up your
father's criminal records,

58:29.572 --> 58:32.109
apparently, it was reported to
the task force team

58:32.408 --> 58:34.388
I was questioned
by the police today

58:35.378 --> 58:37.085
Bo-ra will soon be
questioned too

58:37.881 --> 58:40.418
I'm sorry that
you guys have to do this

58:41.017 --> 58:45.193
It's okay
That's not what's important right now

58:47.991 --> 58:49.834
Is there something else?

58:50.960 --> 58:52.439
I'm certain that he's the guy

58:52.762 --> 58:55.436
For the past 15 years,
I've heard his voice

58:55.532 --> 58:57.512
every day and every night,
even in my dreams

58:58.067 --> 59:01.480
There's something called
the presumption of innocence

59:01.704 --> 59:04.241
Even if we get lucky
and test his voice

59:04.407 --> 59:08.878
It's been 15 years so it might be hard
to get a 100% match

59:09.212 --> 59:10.657
What do you mean?

59:12.115 --> 59:16.325
My ear is more accurate
than a machine. It's him

59:16.452 --> 59:19.922
I feel the same way, which is why
we needed to test his voice first

59:20.023 --> 59:23.004
This is a fight against time
If you only would've held back

59:23.760 --> 59:24.830
Let's go

59:27.130 --> 59:30.270
We'll go search for the girl's
handwriting from the past

59:38.908 --> 59:42.378
Please don't go in
Please don't take photos

59:42.445 --> 59:43.583
Stand back

59:45.148 --> 59:46.593
Hey, take that computer

59:46.816 --> 59:47.624
Yes, sir

59:48.818 --> 59:51.196
Don't you have any notes
or letters from primary school?

59:51.521 --> 59:52.932
Please cooperate with us

59:54.958 --> 59:57.404
Ms. Jung,
this must be hard on you

59:57.961 --> 01:00:01.340
We don't believe
your dad is the killer

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:04.341
We're just trying to find
Chae-jin's killer

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:05.840
Please help us

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:18.586
Guys, look everywhere
very thoroughly

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.422
<i>Who's Jung Soon-man?
The real killer is?</i>

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:30.427
<i>I don't know
Han Chae-jin abduction case</i>

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.167
Did you get anything?

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.235
I think she's suspected
something for a while

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:38.000
But seeing that she hasn't
reported anything yet,

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:39.981
she might've decided to
keep quiet

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:44.711
This is too clean
She doesn't even have an old diary

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.051
- Detective Son
- Yes, sir

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.882
We don't know where she might go
You stay here and watch her

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:54.987
Yes, sir

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:10.638
<i>Daddy, I love you the best in the world
I'm gonna marry you</i>

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.401
<i>Last night, police have arrested
the prime suspect of the Han abduction</i>

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:15.008
<i>D-2
Last night, police have arrested
the prime suspect of the Han abduction</i>

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:20.042
<i>With only 2 clays left,
the suspect remains unconscious</i>

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:24.846
<i>Police wait restlessly
to analyze the suspect's voice</i>

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:27.259
<i>The suspect's daughter
was suspicious of he! father</i>

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:31.620
Did you see the news? They got
the suspect of "The Devil's Whisper"

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.221
Really?
Is he really the kidnapper?

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:36.795
I don't know
But he should be hanged

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:39.134
It's a scary world for parents

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.543
We didn't do anything wrong

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:46.636
By the way

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.180
What did the police say?

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.951
I don't know
This is so annoying

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.876
They're treating me
like a criminal

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:57.380
They said if I don't tell the truth,
withholding information is also a crime

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.015
This really sucks

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:00.753
So what did you tell them?

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.150
I told them that

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:04.961
I got the goose bumps, watching the film
because the voice was so similar

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:09.196
but because it was a friend's dad,
it was difficult to say anything

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.793
You didn't have
to tell them everything

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:13.535
What if...

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.401
Da-eun?

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.482
I'm sorry about
everything you guys

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:31.557
Da-eun
I'm a bit confused right now

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:38.194
We shouldn't see each other
for a while

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:41.734
I'll go get my things tonight

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:45.803
It's okay
I left them at the professor's office

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:52.367
The professor is also worried
about the recommendation letter

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:53.938
that he wrote for you

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:59.544
Right?
He didn't do it

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.382
No, he didn't

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:05.721
You see a recommendation letter
is like a letter of guarantee

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:08.061
I have my reputation
on the line

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:12.223
Luckily, Goryeo Daily News
isn't aware of your situation

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.399
So don't be distracted
Do your best at the interview

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:17.069
Yes, sir

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:22.569
And your dad stopped by my office
a few days ago while I was out

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.503
I don't think
I should receive this

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:28.541
I shouldn't take dietary supplements
like red ginseng anyway

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:34.018
Just tell him
I said thank you

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:41.126
If the police ask,

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:44.826
let's just say that your father
never came here

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:48.660
It's true that
I didn't actually see him

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:51.264
I don't think it'll be good
for you either

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.605
I trust you, Da-eun

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:11.019
<i>Dear Professor Kim</i>

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:14.187
<i>This is Da-eun's father</i>

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:18.320
<i>Da-eun is having a hard time
with reporter interviews</i>

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:20.767
<i>Professor Kim Jung-yup office
Da-eun is having a hard time
with reporter interviews</i>

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:25.298
<i>I don't have
anything to give her!</i>

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:29.932
<i>But I heard that
you help her very much</i>

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:36.076
<i>I should thank you in person
but I'm sorry that! have to leave a letter</i>

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:42.116
<i>Thank you so much for everything</i>

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.116
Don't wake up

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:23.891
It's better this way

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:26.692
Don't wake up

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:32.634
I don't care why you did it

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:36.868
I don't want or care to know

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:42.680
I'll believe what you said
that you didn't do it

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.148
So just

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.387
Don't wake up

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:54.494
Don't wake up

01:05:58.487 --> 01:05:59.864
But

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:06.064
How will I go on from here?

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.011
You are all I've had

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:16.243
I'm so scared

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.712
What am I supposed to do now?

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:46.868
<i>Han abduction reports</i>

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:50.976
<i>D-1</i>

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:57.220
<i>June 24th
Han Chae-jin statute of limitations expires</i>

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:59.448
You probably wrote this
after watching the movie

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:02.951
This is probably from
when you asked for

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:05.296
Jung's police records
from Jane-kyung

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:08.267
You've suspected it for a while,
haven't you?

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:13.962
He got busted because
Jane-kyung asked one of my men

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.063
for Jung's police records

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:17.305
That's just unfortunate

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:21.144
Then you ran away from home

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:26.451
By this time, you became certain
that your father was the kidnapper, correct?

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:31.917
I didn't run away from home
I just spent the night at a friend's house

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:37.225
When Dr. Han handed you the old note,
you remembered what happened, correct?

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.755
No

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:40.800
I heard that
you recalled some things

01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:43.526
Me?

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:47.508
<i>How did they know?</i>

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:51.539
<i>When we looked up your father's
criminal records,</i>

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:54.205
<i>apparently it was reported to
the task force team</i>

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:58.010
<i>I was questioned
by the police today</i>

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:02.150
<i>Bo-ra will soon be questioned too</i>

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.789
<i>I'm sorry that
you guys have to do this</i>

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.516
<i>Is there something else?</i>

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.292
<i>There is something,
isn't there?</i>

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:14.299
<i>Is your father
really the kidnapper?</i>

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:17.535
And you didn't deny it

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.473
I didn't confirm it either

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:25.236
His voice is similar
That's all

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:30.549
You've already made up your mind
to protect your dad, haven't you?

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.618
Am I right?

01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:37.448
I'm telling you the truth

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:45.259
Do you know where this is?

01:08:46.354 --> 01:08:49.234
The kidnapper shoved
Chae-jin into this bag alive

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:51.964
and threw it in the river

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.839
You take a good look at this

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:02.846
He strangled this little boy
for over a minute

01:09:03.104 --> 01:09:04.709
but when the little boy
didn't die,

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:07.911
this tiny boy who was
struggling for his life,

01:09:08.042 --> 01:09:10.956
he shoved him into a bag
and tossed it in the river

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:18.792
Poor boy must've been
so scared inside the bag

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:20.799
Doesn't the thought of it
just make you cringe?

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:27.938
How could a human do this?
Could you forgive him?

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.042
Let's catch this guy

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:39.113
Your father is the killer,
isn't he?

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:45.587
No

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:50.224
Detective Jang Jung woke up

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:58.671
The bastard got up?

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:01.272
You smell like alcohol

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:06.871
Chae-jin's helping the case
Now it's just a matter of time

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:16.346
What about her?

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:19.257
She denies till the end

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:32.472
If my Chae-jin was alive,
he would've been your age

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:35.132
Don't you pity my baby?

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:39.567
I'm alive but not living

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.377
I'm broken into a million pieces

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.445
My poor baby Chae-jin

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.280
I feel so sorry

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:49.544
That bastard is no human
Wake up

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:50.888
If you have a soul

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.824
If you pity Chae-jin,
you can't do this

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.150
Your dad is the kidnapper,
isn't he?

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:57.352
You remember it all,
don't you?

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:59.833
You wrote that note

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.889
When we test his voice,
it'll be all over

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:04.564
Just tell the truth

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:05.999
No

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:09.609
My dad didn't do it
My dad didn't

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:17.750
He doesn't deserve to be a father
You two deserve each other

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.814
You can't do this

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:22.880
Please step out

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:24.782
Let me go

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:30.020
- Tell them
- Let's go and catch that kidnapper

You can't go in
The investigation is in progress

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:02.853
Isn't this going too far?

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.492
You can question him
after he's discharged

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:06.031
We don't have much time

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:08.893
You know the statute of limitations
expires at midnight tomorrow

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:12.829
It's a very tight schedule
to test his voice and get the results

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:22.544
You want Chae-jin to die?

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:26.451
Are you getting mad at me?

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:27.953
Please speak louder

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:33.888
<i>Are you getting mad at me?</i>

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.525
<i>- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?</i>

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:38.824
<i>Don't you care
what happens to your son?</i>

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:42.892
Don't you care
what happens to your son?

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:50.808
Hey, it's the kidnapper's daughter

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:54.038
So you've made up your mind?

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.904
To conceal the guilt

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:59.476
and live as an accomplice
for the rest of your life?

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:01.979
That's fucking beautiful

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:04.957
You'll hold his hand
and live happily together?

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.057
Stop it

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.793
Are you gonna be okay?

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:13.623
It's fucking hell
like what my sister went through

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:16.424
I'm a scumbag myself
but you're pretty tough

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.735
Stop it
Just stop

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.899
Everybody, just stop

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:29.106
Your mom has maybe
a day or two left to live

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:35.077
Come to the hospital

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.853
She says she wants to
tell you something

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:48.124
Come prepared

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:06.084
<i>He strangled this little boy
for over a minute</i>

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.116
<i>but when the little boy
didn't die,</i>

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:11.247
<i>this tiny boy
who was struggling for his life,</i>

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:14.187
<i>he shoved him into a bag
and tossed it in the river</i>

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:18.859
<i>Poor boy must've been
so scared inside the bag</i>

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:33.677
<i>15 hours till</i>

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:37.148
Hello

I'm applicant ID 15,
Jung Da-eun

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:47.416
Hello
I'm applicant ID 15, Jung Da-eun

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.556
Ms. Jung, why do you want to
become a reporter?

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:03.535
Miss Jung?

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:24.894
<i>Momentarily, National Forensic Service
will announce the result of voice analysis</i>

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:31.204
<i>- 4 hours till
- Suspect Jung

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.793
How do you feel right now?

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:02.601
What will you do
if your father is the kidnapper?

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:11.102
<i>Da-eun</i>

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:16.181
Sweetie, don't worry

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:19.880
Daddy didn't do it

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:24.353
Can't he go home now?

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:30.493
Yes, after the results come out,
we'll decide whether he goes home

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:33.028
or to the police station

01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:35.299
My mom is very ill

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:39.031
She might not live to see tomorrow
Please let him go

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:44.644
The result will be out any minute
Please wait

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.204
<i>55 minutes till</i>

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:53.652
<i>Are you getting mad at me?</i>

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:56.084
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:59.080
<i>Don't you care
what happens to your son?</i>

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:01.960
<i>It's ain't over til' it's over</i>

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:25.818
You may go home

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.146
Do you have anything to say
to the victim's family?

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:33.717
Please give us something

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:37.287
Excuse me
Please make way

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:39.161
How do you feel right now?

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.760
Excuse me
Please make way

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:43.928
Please make way

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.634
Officer Lee, make way

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:55.139
<i>- 30 minutes till
- Give me the key
I'll drive</i>

01:17:55.937 --> 01:17:58.645
Where are you going?
I don't trust you

01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:12.526
Chae-jin

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.195
I'm sorry

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.319
Why did you do it?

01:18:40.782 --> 01:18:42.090
What?

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:45.060
Why did you do it?

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:47.492
<i>Da-eun</i>

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:49.494
What's wrong with you?

01:18:49.624 --> 01:18:53.037
- The truth is out
- Why did you kidnap him?

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:56.705
I remember every little thing

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:59.043
The words you called out to me

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:01.538
Next to the Ahyeon-dong overpass,
in front of the bakery

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:05.908
I remember your voice that day
Even how you braided my hair

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:08.017
I remember everything

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:11.846
Da-eun, I didn't do it
You saw that I was found innocent

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:13.520
I really didn't do it

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:27.839
I want you to be
honest with me

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.547
You know where we are?

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:47.759
Answer me

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:50.390
Where are we?

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:52.294
Don't do this to me

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:54.726
I don't care
what kind of person you are

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:56.893
So be honest with me

01:19:57.025 --> 01:20:00.598
Tell me the truth
It's all over anyway

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:13.079
I told you

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:21.660
It ain't over

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.031
'til it's over

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:15.546
It was you

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:18.244
My baby

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:20.813
My baby

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:25.121
Da-eun, it's been tough on you

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:27.517
It's all over

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:33.558
From now on, I'll be better
We'll have a great life

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:35.667
Just trust daddy

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:39.601
How?

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:45.739
How could you?

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.479
Ask for forgiveness

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:55.947
Hey! If you're a human,
ask for forgiveness

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:04.224
Ask forgiveness for your sins

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.801
Come out and ask forgiveness

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:14.134
You put him in a bag
and strangled him

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:22.410
You tossed him in the river here
Ask that little boy for forgiveness

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:27.350
Or let's all die here together

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:30.146
I don't want to go on
with my life anymore

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:33.589
So let's all die here together

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:38.329
Da-eun... Da-eun... Da-eun

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:41.098
Who cares about the dead boy?

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:44.299
I did it all for you
I did it to protect you

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:47.764
Because of Joon-young
I did it all for you

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:50.230
- I did it all for you
- For me?

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:51.767
To protect me?

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:59.281
You and I will burn in hell

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:04.886
Heaven is on our side

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.319
It's all over

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:08.961
It's all over

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:17.328
Yes

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:18.762
Let's end this

01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:22.432
From now on

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.812
I don't know you

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:30.841
I'm not Jung Soon-man's
daughter anymore

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:34.409
What's wrong with you?

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:37.154
Don't you know
how much I love you?

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:40.190
Let's go home

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:56.973
Da-eun, it's all over

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:58.703
Now, it's over

01:25:30.825 --> 01:25:34.161
<i>Midnight last night,
a truck and a sedan crashed</i>

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:36.665
<i>and fell into the river</i>

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:40.167
<i>At 12 A.M., when the statute of limitations
on the Han abduction expired,</i>

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:44.938
<i>one of the drivers, is the father of
kidnapped Han Chae-jin,</i>

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:48.352
<i>has suspected Jung of being
his child's abductor</i>

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:53.886
What about intentionality?

01:25:54.415 --> 01:25:56.452
There's no evidence
indicating the car crash

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:59.698
to be accidental nor intentional
out of revenge

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:02.556
Is it possible that
the dead driver Jung

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:04.161
could be Han Chae-jin's abductor?

01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:06.466
Are you going to continue
the investigation?

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.531
We failed to
find the kidnapper

01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:13.411
and the statute of
limitations has run out

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:18.846
But I believe God
will punish him somehow

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:38.330
When will she wake up?

01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:40.134
They don't say

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:42.740
Even if she wakes up, she's likely
to be physically disabled for life

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:44.168
Really?

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:47.743
Seeing her like this
I feel sorry for her

01:26:48.469 --> 01:26:51.040
Whatever
She's paying the price

01:26:52.073 --> 01:26:55.714
for forgiving and hiding
a criminal like her father

01:26:56.344 --> 01:26:57.379
Am I right?

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:04.954
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:12.803
May the Lord
be in your heart

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:18.038
and help you to confess
your sins with true sorrow

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:24.674
I've been silent
about a horrendous secret

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:32.921
for a very long time

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:39.421
The man I once loved

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:48.903
has kidnapped a child

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:51.941
<i>Soon Mi-sun</i>

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:57.783
and he has raised that child

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:09.755
as his own

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:37.149
<i>I'd like to report the kidnapping
of Soon Mi-sun 26 years ago</i>

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:40.084
<i>Mi-sun is still alive</i>

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:44.363
<i>Jung Da-eun</i>

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:55.431
<i>Soon Mi-sun</i>

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:17.051
My baby girl

01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:19.949
Do you know what I've sacrificed
to have you?

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:22.084
You're mine

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:29.600
Daddy's gonna live
the rest of his life only for you

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:34.100
Look

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:37.230
She looks just like me

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:38.505
Just like me

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:48.283
Hey, you know that I have
Mi-sun's hospital ID wristband

01:30:49.877 --> 01:30:52.687
Should I fucking report you
and all go down together?

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:59.728
You and Mi-sun
I meant Da-eun should be happy

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:02.034
I only want $100,000

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:06.330
You kidnapped a child
for your own good

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:09.934
You've got talent
for you know what

01:31:11.232 --> 01:31:12.939
Can't you just do it again?

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:14.274
Kidnapping

01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:16.511
I'll help you
