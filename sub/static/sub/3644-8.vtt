<i>Previously on </i> Stitchers...

00:05.606 --> 00:07.206
Welcome to the Stitchers
program.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.308
Is that a quantum computer?

00:09.310 --> 00:11.310
This is a picture of Ed
and my mother.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.311
Ed ripped someone out of this
picture. Any ideas who it was?

00:13.314 --> 00:16.181
I assume it's someone he
didn't think very highly of.

00:16.183 --> 00:21.020
Marta said that the murder cases we handle
are test runs for something bigger.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.188
You need to trust that
your mother, Ed Clark,

00:23.190 --> 00:25.057
and the people who
care about you now

00:25.059 --> 00:27.359
are working tirelessly
to keep you safe.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.694
- Hello.
- Liam.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.880
Kirsten has never
mentioned him.

00:30.881 --> 00:33.241
Find out everything you can about him.
I want a full report.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.100

Surprise anything, for that matter.

Dr. Anna Barmal, 35.

02:43.430 --> 02:47.332
She's the lead researcher of epidemiology
at the worldwide health alliance.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.269
She committed suicide last night
in her L.A. apartment.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.505
Sleeping pills.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.740
- We sure it was suicide?
- Yeah, she left a note.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.309
"My body is to be cremated
within 24 hours

02:57.311 --> 02:59.311
"and my ashes sent
to my parents in Mumbai.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.280
These are my only
instructions."

03:01.282 --> 03:04.349
Unfortunately, Dr. Barmal's last
wishes will have to be delayed.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.718
We've been asked to investigate
why she killed herself.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.221
So we're bringing someone
who worked with deadly viruses

03:09.223 --> 03:13.959
and died under mysterious circumstances into the lab?
What could possibly go wrong?

03:13.961 --> 03:17.829
We run 26 different tests on every sample
before they're cleared for stitching.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.665
- Barmal is clear.
- Why'd she kill herself?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.366
Was she part of something
she shouldn't have been?

03:21.368 --> 03:22.801
Well, that's what we want to find out.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.303
When they found her
in her apartment,

03:24.305 --> 03:27.339
she was slumped over
in a scalding shower

03:27.341 --> 03:30.342
and the heat in her apartment
was cranked to the maximum.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.578
What about her research?
Any clues?

03:32.579 --> 03:34.813
Well, you know, it's pretty remarkable,
she didn't write any of her research down.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.815
She had a photographic memory.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.136
Well, let's go and get it while
it's still in there to get.

03:44.491 --> 03:47.226
- So?
- Context, please.

03:47.228 --> 03:50.796
Liam. What did you tell
him when he proposed?

03:50.798 --> 03:52.898
I told him I needed
to think about it.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.567
Smart move. No sense at all in
committing to the one guy on the planet

03:55.569 --> 03:58.303
who loves "impossible you"
exactly as you are.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.439
What do you think
you're gonna tell him?

04:00.441 --> 04:03.442
I'm not sure and assuming you
haven't blabbed to everyone yet,

04:03.444 --> 04:07.312
don't say anything. I haven't told
anyone else that Liam proposed.

04:08.249 --> 04:09.248
(Sighs)

04:09.250 --> 04:10.849
What?

04:19.426 --> 04:22.527
- Congratulations?
- I'm not sure yet.

04:22.529 --> 04:26.298
Well, when you are,
tell me in person

04:26.300 --> 04:28.667
and not over an open channel.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.505
All right.
Stations, please.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.278
- Welcome back.
- Miss me?

04:39.280 --> 04:44.449
I don't suppose you can share details about
whatever special assignment Turner sent you on.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.285
You don't suppose correctly.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.389
How does it feel being the one
kept in the dark for a change?

04:50.391 --> 04:52.391
Kind of sucks.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.061
All right, I'm out of here.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.363
Call me later if there's
going to be cake.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.802
Lights to 20%. I need a go,
no-go for stitch neurosync.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.304
- Life-sci?
- Go.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.338
- Sub-bio?
- Go.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.539
- Engineering?

05:07.541 --> 05:08.974
- Communications?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.375
- Medical?

05:10.377 --> 05:12.411
Comm check. Kirsten. One, two...

05:12.413 --> 05:14.479
What am I doing? We've established
that your comlink works.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.449
All is well. Cut the cake. Induce
stitch neurosync on my mark.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.718
In three, two, one...

05:19.720 --> 05:21.420
Induce stitch neurosync.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.394
I'm in Barmal's lab.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.900
She's looking through a microscope.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.005
- How's she dressed?
- How's she dressed?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.573
Wait.
Why is that even relevant?

05:44.812 --> 05:48.880
- She's in biohazard gear.
- That's how it's relevant.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.383
- Alex, how's the sample looking?
- All readings nominal.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.385
Do not open that corpse cassette.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.187
What's going on?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.988
Worldwide health alliance
scientist plus biohazard suit

05:56.990 --> 05:58.957
equals I don't know what we may
have brought into the lab.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.459
But maybe our tests missed something.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.494
- Should I bounce?
- Linus?

06:02.496 --> 06:04.363
- We're clear.
- Okay, do not bounce.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.932
The environment in the lab is monitored
every 12 seconds. We're clear.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.368
Regardless, I don't want
to take any chances.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.537
I want all non-essential
personnel to clear the lab now.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.472
Go, now.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.009
Okay, keep going, birthday girl.

06:19.413 --> 06:22.414
(Labored breathing)

06:33.160 --> 06:35.427
She's taking off her mask.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.995
Why?

06:36.997 --> 06:39.698
I don't know.
Also her gloves.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.767
And her bio suit.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.576
She's injecting herself with something.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.782
Have her look for markings
on the syringe.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.784
Any markings you can see?

07:01.588 --> 07:07.492
The vial reads "Sample Lot, 6/1 18:03."

07:08.896 --> 07:10.962
She's giving herself
another injection.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.597
Any idea what?

07:12.599 --> 07:13.999
Um...

07:14.001 --> 07:17.502
"CSP21x9."

07:17.504 --> 07:21.473
- Camille?
- CSP21. It's a mutated strain of Spanish flu.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.476
- And x9?
- Potency. Nine is as high as it goes.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.511
Why is she infecting herself?

07:41.495 --> 07:45.230
She's running a blood test.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.899
She's reading the results.

07:49.536 --> 07:52.504
- Doesn't like what she sees.
<i>- (Alarm blaring)</i>

07:52.506 --> 07:54.072
What's that noise?

07:55.909 --> 07:57.676
Trouble. Make the bounce.

08:04.518 --> 08:05.650
What happened?

08:05.652 --> 08:07.519
Our sensors picked up something.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.621
- What?
- Damn it!

08:12.192 --> 08:15.193
<i>(Alarm blaring)</i>

08:15.195 --> 08:16.828
What did you just do?

08:16.830 --> 08:20.131
She put the lab under
emergency lockdown.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.801
Dr. Barmal infected herself
with a mutated virus

08:22.803 --> 08:25.070
and her body just went symptomatic.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.572
I hate being right all the time!

08:37.885 --> 08:39.650
"According to the center
for infectious diseases,

08:39.653 --> 08:43.554
"Dr. Barmal was close to finding a
cure for an aggressive new virus.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.690
"The CSP21 spreads airborne.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.660
"When exposed, a person will
develop flu-like symptoms,

08:48.662 --> 08:51.663
and in all reported cases,
death occurs within hours."

08:51.665 --> 08:54.866
- Definitely not a starve a cold, feed a fever kind of thing.
- Should we be worried?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.635
So far none of us are
sick and we don't know

08:56.637 --> 08:59.004
if the infection has spread
beyond the corpse cassette.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.072
We need to figure out exactly
what we're dealing with.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.576
It's not that complicated. We're dealing
with a body in the corpse cassette

09:04.578 --> 09:07.145
that's spreading a contagion
in a sealed lab full of people.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.614
Alex, how's the seal
on the corpse cassette?

09:09.616 --> 09:11.983
Holding.
Hopefully the virus is contained.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.120
Dr. Barmal thought she found a cure.
That's why she tested it on herself.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.155
Unfortunately, she's taken up
residency in her corpse cassette

09:17.157 --> 09:19.624
and has given us the gift
that keeps on giving.

09:19.625 --> 09:22.092
Yeah, but she must have colleagues. Other
scientists who are familiar with her research.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.129
I'll get on that.
Meanwhile, research the virus.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.031
Find out everything you can about it.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.934
Work up a contingency plan
in case we're on our own.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.036
Preferably one that doesn't
involve all of us dying.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.271
Bet this isn't what you wished
for on your birthday.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.107
Oh, I don't make birthday wishes.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.709
Make one now.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.613
You sent us a disease-ridden sample.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.082
<i>I didn't know she'd injected herself.</i>

09:44.084 --> 09:46.151
<i>She was asymptomatic before she died.</i>

09:46.153 --> 09:50.221
Well, she became symptomatic
post-mortem and highly contagious.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.858
I'm scrambling a Hazmat team, but
it will take some time to assemble.

09:53.860 --> 09:57.596
Your chief asset is fine for now,
but we're all at risk.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.130
You need to reach out
to Barmal's associates.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.050
See what they know about her work.

10:02.051 --> 10:04.969
And tell them what? That while stitching a live
consciousness into a dead woman's memory,

10:04.972 --> 10:08.306
we may have triggered an
epidemic in our secret lab?

10:08.308 --> 10:11.743
Barmal's last serum... the one that
she thought worked... is in her lab,

10:11.745 --> 10:13.979
date-stamped June 1, 18:03 hours.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.682
Maybe there is something
in there that we can build on.

10:17.684 --> 10:21.653
I'll do what I can.
In the meantime,

10:21.655 --> 10:25.724
no matter what happens to you all,
Kirsten needs to survive.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.627
So I want you to put her in isolation.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.865
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.503
How's it going?

10:38.504 --> 10:40.971
Well, considering the only thing this
lab is able to do about a biohazard

10:40.974 --> 10:42.707
is ring alarm bells, not great.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.643
We're just not equipped
for this kind of emergency.

10:44.645 --> 10:47.412
We can work the problem if we knew
Barmal's formula to her serum.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.648
Yeah, but her formula tanked.
So what good would it do?

10:49.650 --> 10:51.650
Well, we have something she didn't have.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.285
A quantum computer that's able to
run more simultaneous equations

10:54.287 --> 10:56.821
than there are atoms in the universe.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.958
Maybe her antiviral serum failed because
she couldn't run enough simulations.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.494
She was willing to test it on herself.
She must have believed in it.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.729
Stitch me back in.
I'll get the formula.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.265
Unfortunately,
that's not going to happen.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.100
Kirsten,
I'm putting you into isolation.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.103
Good luck with that.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.305
We don't know who or how many
of us may be infected.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.042
On the chance that someone is
and you're not,

11:17.044 --> 11:18.877
you need to be isolated
from everyone.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.846
The program depends on you.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.282
Okay, let's say everyone
except me is infected...

11:24.284 --> 11:25.817
How about let's not?

11:25.819 --> 11:27.118
...and I'm the last
person standing?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.453
What makes you think
that I would stay

11:28.455 --> 11:30.221
with a revamped,
restaffed program anyway?

11:30.223 --> 11:34.859
- That's what I figured.
- So stitch me back in.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.163
Her refractory period is short.
We can stitch immediately.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.965
- Great.
- Hold on. Now that Barmal's body has gone symptomatic,

11:40.967 --> 11:42.768
we don't know what that
will do to her memory.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.055
We can't just sit
around and wait.

11:47.056 --> 11:49.907
Besides, it's my birthday
and I can stitch if I want to.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.882
Okay.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.783
Listen, Stretch.
Bounce if it gets too funky in there.

11:59.786 --> 12:02.353
I love it when you talk science to me.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.756
It's your birthday so
I'm gonna let that one slide.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.158
Initiate stitch neurosync on my mark.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.962
Three, two, one, and mark.

12:15.168 --> 12:19.337
- You still with me, KC?
- Sure, CG.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.173
I'm in the lab again.

12:22.175 --> 12:26.211
And you're right, the virus
is making things a little funky.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.512
Define funky.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.347
Like when you have a high fever,

12:29.349 --> 12:31.316
everything's a throbbing blur.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.761
Sample brain's degrading
from the internal heat.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.362
Get a move on, sweet pea.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.231
Barmal's working on it...

12:47.901 --> 12:49.934
But she isn't happy.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.469
Move me forward in time.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.913
Memory collapse imminent.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.982
Kirsten, you need to bounce.
You listening?

13:03.984 --> 13:06.317
- Something to write on...
- What?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.520
- I need a something to write on.
- I'm on it.

13:08.522 --> 13:09.954
Tell her she's gotta go.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.022
Kirsten.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.025
Hang on.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.497
Kirsten?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.067
"iheartlinus."

13:25.338 --> 13:26.404
(Gasps)

14:04.411 --> 14:07.245
That's it.
Make any sense to you?

14:07.247 --> 14:09.547
(Imitates Bones from <i>Star Trek</i> )
"Damn it, Jim. I'm a neuroscientist,

14:09.549 --> 14:11.482
- not a molecular biologist."
- Focus.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.418
Just trying to lighten the mood.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.420
Yeah, we can load that into
the quantum computer.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.256
Linus, digitize the output.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.525
You okay, bud?

14:20.527 --> 14:23.328
What? Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
What do you need?

14:23.330 --> 14:26.030
- What? I'm fine.
- You're warm.

14:26.032 --> 14:29.067
- Ayo.
- Stop. This is ridiculous.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.335
Quiet, you.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.537
101.2.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.375
It's beginning.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.517
How's he doing?

14:46.519 --> 14:48.219
Don't sugarcoat it.

14:48.221 --> 14:52.156
Headache, chills,
muscle pain, fever at 102.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.058
- And his blood pressure is...
- Low.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.394
If it drops any lower,
you could experience dizziness,

14:56.396 --> 14:59.230
confusion,
subconjunctival hemorrhage.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.299
Subconjunctival hemorrhage?

15:01.301 --> 15:03.368
Bleeding in the eyes.

15:03.370 --> 15:07.005
I was wrong.
I need sugarcoating.

15:08.475 --> 15:12.377
In other bad news,
I just generated a statistical model

15:12.379 --> 15:17.115
that puts the chance we're
all infected at a robust 98%.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.950
I'm sorry, guys.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.619
What are we gonna do?

15:21.621 --> 15:24.555
I choose to panic in my own way.

15:24.557 --> 15:28.359
We work the problem.
The time is running now on all of us.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.562
Okay, clearly Barmal's
formula was ineffectual.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.299
How long will it take until we find out
what went wrong so we can make adjustments?

15:34.301 --> 15:37.235
Our computers can do it quickly, but
we'll need a pre-symptomatic sample

15:37.237 --> 15:40.471
of Barmal's blood to isolate exactly how
the serum affected her immune system.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.608
I took a routine sample of her
blood before the virus kicked in.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.510
It's in the medical bay.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.521
(Buzzer)

15:59.092 --> 16:01.492
- Ayo.
- We're locked out.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.594
It's an automatic
security precaution.

16:03.596 --> 16:07.031
The computer must have calculated
that the virus originated in the lab

16:07.033 --> 16:08.366
and is isolating it.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.501
Insult, meet injury.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.503
- Damn it.
- Can you override it?

16:15.141 --> 16:17.508
Damn it.
Baptiste, Magritte.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.609
(Mouths)

16:18.611 --> 16:20.678
Confirm voice recognition.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.447
Command level override.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.987
Shall we play a game of chess?

16:28.989 --> 16:31.022
You gotta be freakin' kidding me.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.390
Now what?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.695
Where does that access panel lead?

16:39.132 --> 16:43.067
As you all know, the lab was built
in an old hydroelectric substation.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.202
Told you.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.205
I'm begging you.

16:47.206 --> 16:50.207
The drainage culvert under the flooring
was repurposed as cabling channels.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.544
There is one access point
that runs 100 feet

16:53.546 --> 16:57.181
from the observation deck
straight to the medical bay.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.317
- I'll go.
- No, you can't.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.587
There's an old gear shaft
that narrows the culvert

17:02.589 --> 17:04.756
to 18 inches by 9 inches.

17:04.758 --> 17:06.190
Guess I'm out.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.026
I can fit through that, I think.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.762
You need to take care of those
of us who are getting sick.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.031
It's okay. I'll be fine.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.200
It's not just you anymore.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.740
- I'm okay.
- (Beeps)

17:22.742 --> 17:24.108
101.7.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.447
Okay, stop staring at me.
I'm not dead yet.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.582
Yeah, and it looks like
I get to keep it that way.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.053
I'll go. I can do it.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.554
You sure?

17:36.556 --> 17:39.090
Maggie:
How do you feel?

17:39.092 --> 17:42.060
Like crawling through a hundred feet
of repurposed drainage culvert.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.494
Thanks so much for asking.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.237
Okay, the yellow cables will
lead you to the medical bay.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.273
Follow the yellow brick road.
Got it.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.241
- Comlink.
- Thank you.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.110
The distance from here to
the medical bay is 100 feet.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.145
We'll track your progress remotely.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.914
It should take you about
eight minutes to get there.

18:02.916 --> 18:06.517
Give me ten.
Underachiever.

18:06.519 --> 18:10.154
Once there, you'll be able to open the
door from the inside and let Ayo in.

18:10.156 --> 18:14.192
Sounds good.
Okay, let's do this.

18:16.162 --> 18:18.496
(Cell phone ringing)

18:23.269 --> 18:25.103
Liam?

18:25.105 --> 18:27.105
Can we talk about this later?

18:27.107 --> 18:31.209
Because I'm in the middle of something.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.211
I said later, please.

18:41.621 --> 18:45.189
(Coughing)

18:45.191 --> 18:48.159
- Hey.
- Let me see.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.295
Don't tell Maggie.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.731
She needs to know.

18:53.733 --> 18:57.201
She'll find out soon enough.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.707
Okay, Camille, how you doing?

19:02.709 --> 19:06.844
Ugh. This is the third most
awful thing I've ever done.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.147
<i>(Coughs)</i>

19:11.284 --> 19:14.452
Okay, I see the gear
thingy up ahead.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.162
I'm ruining my t-shirt.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.364
The agency will get you
another one.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.733
Screw that, Maggie.
I want hazard pay.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.905
(Grunting)

19:40.480 --> 19:43.181
(Gasps)

19:43.183 --> 19:48.186
Camille, you're almost there.
Just keep following the yellow cable.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.521
She stopped moving.
Is she okay?

19:50.523 --> 19:55.226
Camille. Camille.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.894
Camille.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.731
Maggie: Camille!

20:03.469 --> 20:07.238
Camille, Camille, are you there?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.207
<i>(Camille screams)</i>

20:09.209 --> 20:12.476
Here, give it.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.912
Okay, Camille, talk to me.
What's going on?

20:14.914 --> 20:16.647
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. (Exhaling)

20:16.649 --> 20:19.350
<i>Camille, what is it?</i>

20:19.352 --> 20:22.253
There's a rat in here.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.222
(Mouths)

20:24.224 --> 20:26.257
Oh, okay, that's all?

20:26.259 --> 20:29.360
There are two things in
the world that terrify me.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.929
Rats and hairy backs.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.400
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, it's touching me.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.369
It's disgusting and it's
touching me with its rat teeth

20:38.371 --> 20:41.572
and its rat fur covered
in rat diseases.

20:41.574 --> 20:45.409
You know, you are carrying
a deadly virus in your system

20:45.411 --> 20:47.345
that could wipe out the entire
human species,

20:47.347 --> 20:51.282
so... so listen, if you wanna play the
"who is more disgusting to whom game,"

20:51.284 --> 20:52.483
I think you actually win.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.819
(Laughs) Maybe.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.487
Kirsten, I don't think I can do this.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.523
Yes, you can. It's more scared
of you than you are of it.

20:59.525 --> 21:03.394
Yeah, I'm totally striking fear
into its heart.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.264
Oh, my God. I can't.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.366
Do it for Linus.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.402
Okay, I can. I can.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.672
(Exhales)

21:17.744 --> 21:20.578
Okay.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.613
You're just a rock.

21:22.615 --> 21:26.817
A rock moving around in the middle
of my back, but just a rock.

21:26.819 --> 21:30.454
Okay, now take a deep breath.

21:30.456 --> 21:33.291
<i>And just relax and keep moving.</i>

21:36.462 --> 21:37.895
Okay.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.950
Just a few more feet.

21:59.952 --> 22:03.487
Okay, Camille,
you're under the medical bay.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.956
There should be an access
panel to the right.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.792
Camille?

22:18.871 --> 22:20.371
Are you okay?

22:20.373 --> 22:22.673
If the CSP21 germ
doesn't do me in,

22:22.675 --> 22:24.475
I'm pretty sure rat-induced nightmares will.

22:24.477 --> 22:25.876
I'll run Dr. Barmal's blood sample.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.378
How long do you need?

22:27.380 --> 22:29.013
Twenty-five minutes for
the centrifuge,

22:29.015 --> 22:30.381
another ten to test her CBC count.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.383
Every minute counts.

22:35.355 --> 22:38.489
- Rat.
- If you cooked it, it could feed a family.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.008
It was huge.

22:41.009 --> 22:43.526
I've input the antiviral formula
into the quantum computer.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.496
By factoring in Barmal's
blood analysis...

22:45.498 --> 22:47.498
how the serum affected
her immune system...

22:47.500 --> 22:51.001
the computer may be able
to detect why it failed.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.503
And then what?

22:52.505 --> 22:54.004
Maybe Barmal was close.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.507
If she made a small
miscalculation in her research,

22:56.509 --> 22:59.377
the computer could possibly pick
it up and point us to a cure.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.445
- It's a long shot.
- Not necessarily.

23:01.447 --> 23:04.548
Dr. Barmal spent two years
of her life working on this.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.917
Maybe she was on
the right track.

23:09.422 --> 23:10.921
Now we wait.

23:12.458 --> 23:16.460
(Coughing)

23:20.032 --> 23:22.066
Hey, you.

23:23.403 --> 23:27.605
- Boy, you don't look so hot.
- Neither do you.

23:27.607 --> 23:31.976
Well, just between us, I think I
might be coming down with something.

23:36.783 --> 23:39.550
Can I get you anything?

23:39.552 --> 23:43.888
More water or just a shoulder
to rest your head?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.923
I wouldn't mind a shoulder.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.191
Okay.

23:56.169 --> 23:59.470
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

23:59.472 --> 24:03.607
It'd be nicer if there wasn't
rat poop on your shirt.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.443
What? Shut up! Where?

24:05.445 --> 24:06.510
Just kidding.

24:06.512 --> 24:09.914
That's so not funny.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.716
Damn rat nearly gave me
a heart attack.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.154
Your forehead's on fire.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.096
Are you scared?

24:27.633 --> 24:28.566
Yes.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.604
Me too.

24:46.619 --> 24:50.020
Okay, the results are in.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.522
Maggie: And?

24:52.658 --> 24:55.493
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?

24:55.495 --> 24:59.630
Barmal designed her serum to block the
virus from entering human blood cells.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.066
- So where did she go wrong?
- She didn't. That's the problem.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.935
Her formula is correct.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.896
I mean, chemically speaking,
it should have been the cure.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.973
Then why'd she still get sick?

25:08.975 --> 25:12.676
Because despite what this multi-million
dollar supercomputer says,

25:12.678 --> 25:14.979
Dr. Barmal missed something.

25:16.582 --> 25:17.781
So now what?

25:20.653 --> 25:23.087
If there's someone you want
to say goodbye to...

25:26.592 --> 25:28.559
Now's the time.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.074
Aren't you going to call your fiancé?

25:44.076 --> 25:46.243
He's not my fiancé.
We're not engaged.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.212
But he proposed.

25:48.214 --> 25:51.148
Yeah, and I never
gave him an answer.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.716
What did Barmal miss?

25:52.718 --> 25:55.586
Well...
(Coughs)

25:56.689 --> 25:59.189
Clearly this is none
of my business,

25:59.191 --> 26:03.894
but seeing that this may be
the last fight we ever have...

26:03.896 --> 26:06.230
Look, it's not like I was hiding this from you.

26:06.232 --> 26:10.568
No, but friends occasionally tell
each other things about their lives,

26:10.570 --> 26:15.072
you know, like getting a
parking ticket or jury duty

26:15.074 --> 26:17.741
or a marriage proposal.

26:17.743 --> 26:22.680
Liam asked me a question
which I haven't answered yet.

26:22.682 --> 26:26.050
Therefore, there was
nothing for me to report.

26:27.820 --> 26:31.655
Anyway, whether or not you decide to marry
Liam, you should probably call him.

26:31.657 --> 26:35.059
You know what? Let me be clear.
I have no intention of dying.

26:36.629 --> 26:39.763
Not like this.
So I'm not calling anybody.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.038
(Clicks)

26:48.040 --> 26:49.740
Hello.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.041
Hey, Ma.

26:51.043 --> 26:55.212
Linus, where are you?
What's wrong?

26:55.214 --> 26:57.314
Nothing. I'm just at work.

26:57.316 --> 27:01.852
Samir. It's Linus from the office.
Something's wrong.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.821
Everything is okay, Ma.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.689
You're in trouble, aren't you?

27:05.691 --> 27:07.391
- No, Baba.
- You got fired?

27:07.393 --> 27:10.194
No. I can't call you guys
just to say hello?

27:10.196 --> 27:12.296
But you said we can't
call you at the office.

27:12.298 --> 27:16.333
You can't.
Unless it's an emergency.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.902
Benjamin, if you're there,
can you pick up?

27:20.940 --> 27:23.207
Benjamin?

27:23.209 --> 27:25.776
I'm calling you to say...

27:29.649 --> 27:32.149
what I want you to know
is that I'm sorry

27:32.151 --> 27:35.019
that I wasn't around
for you more and...

27:36.389 --> 27:37.721
are you there?

27:37.723 --> 27:39.223
Woman: <i> Dr. Goodkin.</i>

27:39.225 --> 27:42.259
Dr. Goodkin here too.

27:42.260 --> 27:45.294
<i>I'm running into a meeting. So whoever
this is, kindly get to the point.</i>

27:45.297 --> 27:49.299
It's me, Ma.
Cameron, your son.

27:49.301 --> 27:52.803
<i>Nigel, it's my son.</i>
<i>I'll be in, in a moment.</i>

27:52.805 --> 27:55.305
<i>How are you feeling, Cam?</i>

27:55.307 --> 27:58.175
I'm fine.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.445
I just felt like calling.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.747
<i>You keeping up with your medication?</i>

28:03.749 --> 28:07.718
I'm not a kid anymore, Ma, okay?
I can take care of myself.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.720
I just wanted to say that

28:09.722 --> 28:13.057
I love you both very much.

28:13.059 --> 28:16.894
I knew something was wrong.

28:16.896 --> 28:19.029
So what is the problem, son?

28:19.031 --> 28:23.367
Whatever it is, we love you, and
we can get through it together.

28:23.369 --> 28:26.370
I want you to know that
I'm sorry about what I said

28:26.372 --> 28:28.772
to you before you redeployed.

28:28.774 --> 28:33.410
I do understand your responsibility
to the guys more than you know.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.879
<i>Everything okay with your</i>
<i>government tinker-toys</i>

28:35.881 --> 28:37.815
<i>or whatever it is you're working on?</i>

28:37.817 --> 28:39.183
Do we really have to do this now?

28:39.185 --> 28:41.052
<i>No, I suppose not.</i>

28:41.053 --> 28:42.920
<i>I don't want you hanging up
on me again like last time.</i>

28:42.922 --> 28:46.390
Look, I'm sorry about that, okay?
I really am.

28:46.392 --> 28:50.227
<i>It's just you gave up a coveted</i>
<i>research position at MIT,</i>

28:50.229 --> 28:53.731
<i>- a position of a lifetime.</i>
- Lifetime...

28:55.768 --> 28:58.969
I'm calling because I'm...

29:01.407 --> 29:03.140
I'm so happy.

29:03.142 --> 29:06.977
I love my job,

29:06.979 --> 29:08.846
and I have a great girlfriend.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.815
And my life is amazing
because of you guys.

29:11.817 --> 29:14.084
You have a girlfriend?

29:15.788 --> 29:17.755
This is what you're
trying to tell us?

29:17.757 --> 29:20.090
Yeah, Ma.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.826
- When can we meet her?
- One day soon enough.

29:22.828 --> 29:25.462
Bring her for dinner.
I'll make chicken tikka.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.030
Do you think you
two have a future?

29:29.468 --> 29:32.503
I think we'll be together
for a very long time.

29:34.807 --> 29:38.842
Also, and this is very important,

29:38.844 --> 29:43.847
whatever happens, I don't want you
to feel guilty about anything, okay?

29:43.849 --> 29:47.951
We have both always done
what was expected of us.

29:53.793 --> 29:56.160
I want you to be safe
over there, okay?

30:01.333 --> 30:03.200
I love you, Ben.

30:08.407 --> 30:12.409
<i>I just want to know, was it worth it?</i>

30:19.919 --> 30:21.852
Yeah.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.868
Am I interrupting?

30:41.006 --> 30:44.441
No. Actually, I'm glad you're here.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.176
I have something for you.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.414
What?

30:59.959 --> 31:03.594
Your birthday present.

31:03.596 --> 31:06.496
This is my present?

31:09.001 --> 31:12.269
No. This is your present.

31:16.075 --> 31:19.477
You knew my mother?

31:19.478 --> 31:22.880
I worked with her when I was first
administrating the Stitchers program.

31:22.882 --> 31:25.315
But she never worked at the program.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.351
She did.

31:27.353 --> 31:32.055
In fact, your mother was one of the
original designers of our technology

31:32.057 --> 31:33.357
along with Ed.

31:33.359 --> 31:36.593
And my father.

31:36.595 --> 31:41.498
Kirsten, Ed and your mother

31:41.500 --> 31:44.902
were the real visionaries
behind Stitchers.

31:47.339 --> 31:50.540
- But that's not...
- What you were led to believe. I know.

31:50.542 --> 31:55.078
The reality is that your father couldn't
keep up with Ed and your mother

31:55.080 --> 31:59.483
and compensated by taking credit
for her work after she died.

32:02.388 --> 32:06.023
So your birthday gift to me

32:06.025 --> 32:10.327
is to shatter what few beliefs I had
about what little I can remember

32:10.329 --> 32:14.231
from my past. Oh, you shouldn't have.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.967
You've been asking for the truth.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.071
Now you have it.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.947
This is Ed's handwriting.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.249
What does he want us to remember?

32:32.251 --> 32:34.952
After your mother died,

32:34.954 --> 32:40.023
I promised him I would look after
you if something happened to him.

32:40.025 --> 32:41.959
I think he wanted me
to remember that promise.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.994
And what does he want me to remember?

32:43.996 --> 32:46.596
Who you are.

32:46.598 --> 32:50.000
And that your mother
loved you completely.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.973
I wish I could remember her.

33:00.079 --> 33:03.213
All I can seem to remember is Ed.

33:03.215 --> 33:06.650
In spite of what you
think you know about him,

33:06.652 --> 33:11.088
Ed Clark cared about you.

33:11.090 --> 33:15.125
He was one of most
gentle people I ever knew.

33:15.127 --> 33:18.729
If you felt that way, why
didn't you grieve when he died?

33:18.731 --> 33:21.231
What makes you think I didn't?

33:23.168 --> 33:27.237
You're not the only one around here who
has trouble showing their emotions.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.278
Hey.

33:35.280 --> 33:39.549
- Small sips, okay?
- Thanks.

33:39.551 --> 33:43.720
How'd it go, with your parents?

33:43.722 --> 33:46.790
It went.

33:46.792 --> 33:50.027
Anyways, who are you
thinking about calling?

33:50.029 --> 33:51.661
(Clears throat)

33:51.663 --> 33:56.433
You know, it's a tossup
between no one and nobody.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.468
(Laughs)

33:58.470 --> 34:01.538
There's gotta be someone in your
family you wanna call. Your parents?

34:01.540 --> 34:04.141
No, they walked out on me when I was 16.

34:04.143 --> 34:06.343
I haven't seen them since.

34:08.047 --> 34:12.149
Everyone I care about
is in here with me.

34:18.590 --> 34:22.092
Okay, what time exactly
did Dr. Barmal die?

34:22.094 --> 34:24.226
11:56 PM.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.364
Look, I know you have trouble
with these kinds of things,

34:27.366 --> 34:30.067
but I think it might be good for
you to say goodbye to Liam.

34:30.069 --> 34:32.069
I did say goodbye
to Liam this morning.

34:32.071 --> 34:34.504
That's different. You thought
you were gonna see him tonight.

34:34.505 --> 34:38.742
Protocol to inhibit deterioration
was administered when exactly?

34:38.744 --> 34:40.476
12:01.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.248
So she was placed in
the corpse cassette at 7:00 AM.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.583
Stitch initiated 28 minutes after that.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.154
- Look, all I'm saying is if you care about him...
- I do care about Liam.

34:51.156 --> 34:54.091
But right now I care more
about saving our asses

34:54.092 --> 34:56.793
and wasting precious time
processing the emotions associated

34:56.795 --> 34:59.796
with making a phone call
to my maybe/maybe not fiancé

34:59.798 --> 35:03.600
- to say a veiled goodbye will prevent me from helping to...
- To save our asses.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.136
No, I get it, but here's
something you need to get.

35:06.138 --> 35:09.439
We might die and that is something you're
gonna have to face sooner or later.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.358
Okay.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.276
I'm under the impression that dying
is kind of a big deal, Kirsten.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.212
Can we just talk about
stuff we know about?

35:15.214 --> 35:16.546
I know about this.

35:18.117 --> 35:20.784
When I was ten years old,
I had heart surgery.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.253
Remember that scar?
I needed a valve replaced.

35:23.255 --> 35:26.156
The doctor said I had less
than 50% chance of living.

35:26.158 --> 35:29.143
My parents didn't think I'd survive.

35:29.144 --> 35:32.129
And when I did, they were very grateful.
They were very scared.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.830
They didn't want me
overexerting myself.

35:33.832 --> 35:37.634
The playground? Forget it. Sports?
Cameron's too fragile for that.

35:37.636 --> 35:41.304
They thought if I exerted myself,
it would kill me.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.207
So this scar is a constant reminder

35:44.209 --> 35:46.309
of how fragile life is.

35:48.280 --> 35:52.215
And how fragile
my parents thought I was.

35:52.217 --> 35:57.154
Well, I think that you
have proven them wrong

35:57.156 --> 35:59.189
several times over.

36:09.201 --> 36:12.903
Dr. Barmal killed herself to
stop the virus spreading, right?

36:12.905 --> 36:15.205
She assumed the virus
would die with her.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.374
Yeah, and it did.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.376
She wasn't contagious
when she got here.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.545
The lab sensors would
have detected that.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.914
Something we did
activated the virus?

36:23.916 --> 36:26.516
It went live when she was
in the corpse cassette.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.885
Which is a frosty 33 degrees.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.521
So the cold brought
the virus back to life.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.691
When they found her
in her apartment,

36:34.693 --> 36:37.527
she was slumped over
in a scalding shower

36:37.529 --> 36:40.697
and the heat in her apartment
was cranked to the maximum.

36:40.699 --> 36:45.202
Wait, she took a hot shower and turned
up the heat to activate the serum?

36:45.204 --> 36:47.504
She thought the heat
would make it work.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.239
But she just
realized it too late.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.907
Okay, wait, how hot
can we make the lab?

36:50.909 --> 36:52.976
Hot enough. We just need
the serum from Barmal's lab.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.845
You are a genius.

36:55.847 --> 36:59.249
- You're just getting that now?
- Crank the heat.

36:59.251 --> 37:00.817
Cameron:
Who are you calling?

37:00.819 --> 37:04.487
<i>- (Clicks)</i>
- Fisher, it's me.

37:04.489 --> 37:07.324
No, no, there's no cake yet.
We need your help.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.960
Please tell me you're
not afraid of heights.

37:15.500 --> 37:19.336
I've never wanted to dive
into the fish tank so badly.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.339
Cooling down would defeat the
purpose of what we're trying to do.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.774
With the temperature this
high, when we get the serum,

37:24.776 --> 37:26.409
it should speed up
the recovery process,

37:26.411 --> 37:29.279
and in the meantime,

37:29.281 --> 37:31.381
it may prevent the virus
from spreading.

37:33.719 --> 37:37.287
- How are you doing, Tim?
- I feel good.

37:37.289 --> 37:41.324
- You're not sick?
- I'm too big to fail.

37:41.326 --> 37:44.561
(Cell phone rings)

37:44.563 --> 37:46.296
Fisher.

37:48.400 --> 37:51.334
He's here. He's got Barmal's
serum from Turner.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.808
(Buzzer)

38:05.884 --> 38:09.886
I'm accessing
the elevator shaft now.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.922
<i>(Alarm blaring)</i>

38:14.326 --> 38:16.393
- Oh, crap.
- What?

38:16.395 --> 38:20.930
Our security system detected a breach
at the lockdown in the elevator shaft.

38:28.307 --> 38:31.541
The system isn't recognizing it's
Fisher trying to save our asses.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.524
Damn it, we're locked out
of the computer.

38:47.526 --> 38:51.328
Can't we just unplug it?
I'm sorry.

38:51.330 --> 38:54.497
- Tell Fisher to get out of here while he can before...
- Before what?

38:54.499 --> 38:56.466
Before all the oxygen is sucked
from the elevator shaft

38:56.468 --> 38:59.803
and fills with halon gas
to kill any pathogens.

38:59.805 --> 39:03.106
This lab is really beginning
to piss me off.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.452
He has 90 seconds.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.754
Okay, Fisher, Fisher.
Can you hear me?

39:17.756 --> 39:21.424
<i>In less than 90 seconds, the elevator
shaft is gonna fill with halon gas</i>

39:21.426 --> 39:22.625
<i>and you won't be able to breathe.</i>

39:22.627 --> 39:24.694
Fantastic.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.934
Kirsten?

39:32.437 --> 39:33.636
Kirsten!

39:35.407 --> 39:37.374
Cameron: Kirsten!

39:40.045 --> 39:42.379
(Grunting)

39:42.381 --> 39:45.515
- They're locked down.
- We need to force it open.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.518
Both: Tim!

39:55.861 --> 39:58.027
(Grunts)

40:01.600 --> 40:05.568
(Grunting)

40:13.512 --> 40:16.646
(Groaning)

40:23.555 --> 40:25.955
(Groans)

40:35.600 --> 40:37.434
Save them. Save yourself.

40:37.436 --> 40:41.104
No one else is gonna die
protecting me.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.812
Oh, my God.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.515
(Coughing)

40:54.453 --> 40:57.587
- It's all in here.
- I'll start with the injections.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.456
Okay, treat the sickest first.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.591
Good to see you, Fisher.

41:02.861 --> 41:06.095
Well, I heard there was cake.

41:06.097 --> 41:07.664
(Laughs)

41:07.666 --> 41:12.035
(Panting) Soon, Fisher, soon.

41:13.472 --> 41:16.005
- Man: <i> Lockdown complete.</i>
- Okay, so it looks good.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.641
We've scanned the lab twice and it's clean.

41:18.643 --> 41:21.511
- The high heat wiped out the virus.
- How about my team?

41:21.513 --> 41:25.582
Clothes are being destroyed, and the
disinfecting protocol has worked.

41:25.584 --> 41:29.586
Not to mention the emergency
delivery of Barmal's serum.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.621
All of our lab work
has come back clean.

41:31.623 --> 41:34.858
There's no trace of the virus left at all.
You're cleared to leave.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.993
(Laughing)

41:36.995 --> 41:39.796
Well, that was fun.
Now what?

41:39.798 --> 41:41.598
How about the rest
of the day off?

41:41.600 --> 41:44.000
Thank you, boss.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.169
Ugh! How are you feeling?

41:46.171 --> 41:50.139
If I said lousy, would you come
home and nurse me back to health?

41:50.141 --> 41:52.775
He's fine.

41:52.777 --> 41:54.244
Thanks, Fisher.

41:54.246 --> 41:55.678
You know,
I do have a first name.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.147
Yeah, I know.
Thanks, Fisher.

42:01.686 --> 42:05.688
You know what, guys?
Best birthday ever.
