WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.273
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.273 --> 00:05.276
TOM AND LYNETTE
DRIFTED FURTHER APART,

00:05.276 --> 00:08.138
AND JANE TOOK ADVANTAGE.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.140
I'M SCARED.

00:09.140 --> 00:11.782
ROY HELPED KAREN
FACE HER CANCER.

00:11.782 --> 00:13.384
WE'RE DONE.

00:13.384 --> 00:15.616
I'M THE ONE THAT DECIDES
WHEN WE'RE DONE.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.218
THE LOAN SHARK
THREATENED RENEE.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.320
OHH!
 BUT MIKE STEPPED IN.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.193
I DON'T EVER WANNA
SEE YOU AGAIN.
 THEN YOU SHOULDA KILLED ME.

00:22.193 --> 00:24.355
BREE DISCOVERED THE TRUTH
ABOUT ORSON...

00:24.355 --> 00:27.027
YOU WROTE THE LETTERS?
YOU KILLED CHUCK?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.160
AND CUT OFF ALL CONTACT
WITH HIM.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.632
DON'T YOU EVER
CALL MY HOUSE AGAIN.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.205
I CAN ASSURE YOU THIS IS
THE LAST YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME.

00:34.205 --> 00:36.467
BUT ORSON HAD THE LAST WORD.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.144
(Mary Alice)
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD,

00:43.144 --> 00:46.517
THERE ARE PEOPLE WE SEE
EVERY DAY,

00:46.517 --> 00:51.482
AND EVERY DAY,
WE TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED.
 (meows)

00:51.482 --> 00:53.124
AS WE GO ABOUT OUR LIVES,

00:53.124 --> 00:58.089
WE MAY BE BUSY
WITH A MUNDANE TASK

00:58.089 --> 01:02.093
AND MISS ONE ANOTHER
COMPLETELY.

01:02.093 --> 01:05.636
OR WE MIGHT GIVE
A POLITE WAVE,

01:05.636 --> 01:08.839
ONLY TO RETURN TO WHAT
WE WERE DOING.

01:10.601 --> 01:14.145
ONE MINUTE, WE'RE SPENDING
TIME WITH A LOVED ONE...

01:15.846 --> 01:19.480
AND THE NEXT,
WE'RE WRAPPED UP IN OUR WORK.

01:21.682 --> 01:25.856
OR PREOCCUPIED
WITH OUR OWN PROBLEMS.

01:27.618 --> 01:32.123
WHAT A SHAME THESE NEIGHBORS
TAKE EACH OTHER FOR GRANTED...

01:32.123 --> 01:35.696
BECAUSE IN JUST A FEW DAYS...

01:35.696 --> 01:39.230
ONE OF THESE PEOPLE
WILL BE DEAD.

01:50.641 --> 01:53.884
THAT AFTERNOON,
OLD FRIENDS GOT TOGETHER

01:53.884 --> 01:57.748
TO SHARE COFFEE AND GOSSIP
AND TO DISCOVER...

01:57.748 --> 01:59.750
IS THERE A CUP FOR ME?

01:59.750 --> 02:04.295
THAT THEY WERE STILL
OLD FRIENDS AFTER ALL.

02:06.797 --> 02:11.732
SO ORSON WAS BEHIND EVERYTHING--
CHUCK, THE LETTERS?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.164
DO YOU KNOW WHY HE DID IT?

02:13.164 --> 02:14.205
HE THOUGHT THE ONLY WAY

02:14.205 --> 02:16.407
HE COULD HAVE ME TO HIMSELF
WAS BY TEARING ME AWAY

02:16.407 --> 02:17.638
FROM YOU THREE.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.241
WELL, GUESS WHAT? HE FAILED.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.314
THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE WE ARE
STILL HERE FOR YOU.

02:23.314 --> 02:25.176
AND NO PSYCHO-ON-WHEELS
IS GONNA CHANGE THAT.

02:25.176 --> 02:26.347
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.220
HE BETTER NOT SHOW HIS FACE
AROUND HERE EVER AGAIN.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.225
WHAT'S WRONG?

02:34.225 --> 02:36.287
THE LAST TIME I SPOKE
TO ORSON,

02:36.287 --> 02:39.930
HE... INTIMATED THAT
HE WOULD TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.

02:39.930 --> 02:41.332
OH, SWEETIE.

02:41.332 --> 02:43.394
AND I SHOULD HAVE DONE
SOMETHING.

02:43.394 --> 02:45.165
I SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM
TELL ME WHERE HE WAS

02:45.165 --> 02:46.267
AND GONE TO HIM.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.200
WHY? SO HE COULD
TORTURE YOU SOME MORE?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.771
I KNOW WHAT HE'S BECOME,
BUT YOU ALL KNOW

02:50.771 --> 02:53.574
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I LOVED
THAT MAN VERY MUCH.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.906
WELL, HE'S NOT THAT MAN
ANYMORE.

02:55.906 --> 02:58.409
(clicks tongue)

03:00.481 --> 03:03.314
OKAY, HAVE WE BEEN SAD
LONG ENOUGH?

03:03.314 --> 03:05.586
BECAUSE I'D JUST LIKE
TO POINT SOMETHING OUT.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.888
WE ARE FINALLY IN THE CLEAR.

03:07.888 --> 03:11.662
SHE'S RIGHT. THE LETTERS WERE
THE LAST QUESTION MARK LEFT.

03:11.662 --> 03:14.665
SO MAYBE NOW WE CAN GET
BACK TO NORMAL.

03:14.665 --> 03:19.430
YES. OUR NIGHTMARE
IS FINALLY OVER.

03:34.445 --> 03:36.216
THANKS.

03:39.490 --> 03:40.951
(loud clatter)

03:42.753 --> 03:44.695
(dog howls in distance)
 IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
OVER HERE?

03:44.695 --> 03:47.558
DOCTORS--THEY SHOULD LEARN
HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE.

03:47.558 --> 03:49.760
I'M AFRAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.862
WE JUST GOT BACK
FROM MY APPOINTMENT.

03:51.862 --> 03:53.734
LOOKS LIKE
THE CANCER'S SPREADING FASTER

03:53.734 --> 03:55.306
THAN ANYONE THOUGHT.

03:55.306 --> 03:56.707
OH, KAREN.

03:56.707 --> 03:57.968
YEP. HE GAVE ME

03:57.968 --> 04:01.612
THE OL' "PUT YOUR AFFAIRS
IN ORDER" SPEECH.

04:01.612 --> 04:03.013
ONLY NOT THAT NICE.

04:03.013 --> 04:05.876
THESE ARE PEOPLE THESE DOCTORS
ARE TALKING TO,

04:05.876 --> 04:07.978
NOT JUST SOME NAME ON A CHART.

04:07.978 --> 04:10.381
THEY CAN ALL GO TO HELL!

04:10.381 --> 04:12.323
(sighs)

04:12.323 --> 04:13.884
I'M SO SORRY.

04:13.884 --> 04:16.357
HE'S JUST PISSED
AT THE WORLD.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.689
OH, I'VE GOT IT.
I'VE GOT IT.

04:18.689 --> 04:20.791
(clatters)

04:20.791 --> 04:21.992
(sighs)

04:21.992 --> 04:23.664
HOW ABOUT YOU?

04:23.664 --> 04:27.398
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

04:27.398 --> 04:30.401
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS
THE CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL.

04:30.401 --> 04:34.975
THE LANE LOOKS SO PRETTY
WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE, YOU KNOW...

04:34.975 --> 04:38.008
KAREN...

04:38.008 --> 04:40.781
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU...

04:40.781 --> 04:43.354
I MEAN IT. ANYTHING.

04:43.354 --> 04:45.616
YEAH. THANKS, BREE.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.965
(doorbell rings)

04:54.965 --> 04:56.427
COME IN!

04:56.427 --> 04:59.400
WOW!
THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.733
YOU ARE GOING ALL OUT.

05:02.733 --> 05:04.575
EVER SINCE
PORTER'S BIG ANNOUNCEMENT,

05:04.575 --> 05:06.677
I HAVE A NEW POLICY
FOR ALL OUR KIDS.

05:06.677 --> 05:07.778
YEAH?

05:07.778 --> 05:09.680
IF YOU CAN RESIST
PROCREATING,

05:09.680 --> 05:11.912
I WILL THROW YOU
A BITCHIN' PARTY.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.344
(laughs) WELL, I JUST--

05:13.344 --> 05:16.086
I WANTED TO DROP OFF
PENNY'S PRESENT, SO...

05:16.086 --> 05:18.048
CHAMPAGNE? ISN'T THAT TAKING
THE BITCHIN' PARTY IDEA

05:18.048 --> 05:19.920
A LITTLE TOO FAR?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.392
THAT IS FOR YOU.

05:21.392 --> 05:22.893
YOU WENT THROUGH
22 HOURS OF LABOR WITH HER.

05:22.893 --> 05:25.356
SEEMS LIKE YOU SHOULD GET
TO CELEBRATE, TOO.

05:25.356 --> 05:28.359
THAT IS SO THOUGHTFUL.

05:28.359 --> 05:31.462
UNCHARACTERISTICALLY THOUGHTFUL,
AND NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

05:31.462 --> 05:33.704
YOU COULD HAVE BROUGHT
PENNY'S PRESENT TO THE PARTY,

05:33.704 --> 05:34.965
SO, UM...

05:34.965 --> 05:36.407
(ribbon crackles)

05:36.407 --> 05:38.369
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:38.369 --> 05:42.042
OKAY, UM...
I WAS JUST WONDERING...

05:42.042 --> 05:44.114
AHEM.
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND...

05:44.114 --> 05:45.946
MM-HMM?

05:45.946 --> 05:47.618
MAYBE WE SHOULD OPEN
THAT CHAMPAGNE NOW.

05:47.618 --> 05:48.879
JUST SAY IT.

05:48.879 --> 05:51.652
I-I WANT TO BRING JANE
TO PENNY'S PARTY.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.485
OH, GOD.

05:54.485 --> 05:56.126
LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD.

05:56.126 --> 05:57.958
BRINGING A DATE TO
YOUR DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY

05:57.958 --> 05:59.530
WHEN YOU'RE STILL MARRIED?

05:59.530 --> 06:02.933
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD.
THIS IS A FAMILY EVENT.

06:02.933 --> 06:04.465
I KNOW, BUT JANE IS
PART OF MY LIFE NOW.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.637
YEAH. YOUR LIFE.

06:06.637 --> 06:09.099
I'M SORRY, LYNETTE,
BUT... (chuckles)

06:09.099 --> 06:11.972
I REALLY WANT TO START INCLUDING
JANE IN SOME OF THESE THINGS.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.474
WHY?

06:13.474 --> 06:14.845
WELL--

06:14.845 --> 06:16.106
DAD!

06:16.106 --> 06:17.608
HEY, YOU. (kiss)

06:17.608 --> 06:18.609
(chuckles)

06:18.609 --> 06:20.380
IS THAT FOR ME?
 AHEM.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.682
CAN I OPEN IT?
(giggles)

06:21.682 --> 06:24.384
HEY, I KNOW THIS TRICK,
AND IF I LET YOU OPEN IT TODAY,

06:24.384 --> 06:25.986
YOU ARE GONNA GUILT ME
INTO BUYING YOU ANOTHER ONE

06:25.986 --> 06:27.888
ON YOUR ACTUAL BIRTHDAY.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.422
THAT'S TOTALLY WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

06:31.422 --> 06:33.023
AND I AM TOTALLY
GONNA FALL FOR IT.

06:33.023 --> 06:34.094
WHAT... (laughs) HEY!

06:34.094 --> 06:35.666
HEY, HEY, HEY.

06:35.666 --> 06:37.498
DIDN'T YOU WANNA FINISH
OUR CONVERSATION?

06:37.498 --> 06:40.501
ANOTHER TIME.
JUST ENJOY THE CHAMPAGNE.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.104
(meows)

06:44.104 --> 06:46.577
YOU HAD TO GET THE GIRLS
A CAT, DIDN'T YOU?

06:46.577 --> 06:47.938
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW
I'M ALLERGIC.

06:47.938 --> 06:50.441
OH, YOU SAY YOU'RE ALLERGIC
TO EVERYTHING YOU DON'T LIKE--

06:50.441 --> 06:53.914
CATS, RAISINS,
THE VACUUM CLEANER.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.686
HEY, THAT IS
MEDICALLY VERIFIED.

06:55.686 --> 06:56.847
GIRLS, SHOW MOMMY
HOW SAD WE'D BE

06:56.847 --> 06:58.619
IF SHE MADE US
GIVE BACK RUFUS?

07:00.591 --> 07:02.523
(purring)

07:02.523 --> 07:04.695
OH, HOW COULD I SAY "NO"
TO SUCH SAD

07:04.695 --> 07:07.458
AND OBVIOUSLY REHEARSED FACES?

07:07.458 --> 07:08.428
(chuckles)

07:08.428 --> 07:09.429
(meows)

07:09.429 --> 07:11.502
DADDY, YOU WANNA SEE HIM
DO A TRICK?

07:11.502 --> 07:13.664
KITTY, FETCH.

07:13.664 --> 07:16.206
(meows)

07:16.206 --> 07:17.568
NOW COME BACK.

07:17.568 --> 07:19.670
(Juanita) RUFUS?

07:19.670 --> 07:23.614
HE KINDA DOES
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

07:23.614 --> 07:25.015
(chuckles)

07:26.577 --> 07:29.079
WELL, HE SHOULD FIT RIGHT IN
AROUND HERE.

07:29.079 --> 07:32.452
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO JUST BROUGHT
KITTY LITTER INTO OUR LIVES.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.786
LOOK... (sighs)
IF THE CAT MAKES THEM HAPPY,

07:35.786 --> 07:37.788
THEN IT MAKES ME HAPPY.

07:37.788 --> 07:39.129
ONE THING I REALIZED
IN REHAB--

07:39.129 --> 07:41.131
THERE IS NOTHING
MORE IMPORTANT TO ME

07:41.131 --> 07:42.793
THAN TAKING CARE
OF YOU GUYS.

07:42.793 --> 07:45.896
I LOVE YOU FOR THAT.
MMM.

07:45.896 --> 07:48.038
AH! BEFORE I FORGET,

07:48.038 --> 07:51.642
I GOT YOU A PRESENT.

07:51.642 --> 07:53.644
OH. (chuckles)

07:53.644 --> 07:55.145
A TIE.

07:55.145 --> 07:58.509
IT'S FOR YOUR FIRST DAY
BACK AT WORK AFTER REHAB.

07:58.509 --> 08:01.512
SOMETHING THAT SAYS,
"I'M SOBER, I'M STYLISH,

08:01.512 --> 08:04.114
AND MY WIFE HAS
EXCELLENT TASTE."

08:04.114 --> 08:06.987
WOW.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.619
I WAS HAVING SO MUCH FUN
WITH YOU AND THE GIRLS,

08:08.619 --> 08:11.762
I... KINDA FORGOT
I HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW.

08:13.624 --> 08:15.265
WELL, YOU COULD SAY
"THANK YOU."

08:15.265 --> 08:16.867
I SPENT A LOT OF YOUR MONEY
ON IT.

08:16.867 --> 08:20.200
SORRY, BABE. THANK YOU.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.004
OKAY. (singsongy)
BEDTIME FOR BONZOS!

08:38.619 --> 08:40.650
HELLO THERE.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.893
THANK YOU
FOR FIXING MY CAR TODAY.

08:42.893 --> 08:44.825
I LIKE A MAN
WHO'S GOOD WITH HIS HANDS.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.827
IT'S VERY SEXY.

08:46.827 --> 08:51.932
ALTHOUGH I THINK MY ENGINE
IS STILL RUNNING A LITTLE HOT.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.535
VROOM.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.308
(chuckles)
SUSAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:58.308 --> 08:59.539
THE QUESTION IS,

08:59.539 --> 09:03.844
"WHO AM I DOING?"
THE ANSWER IS "YOU."

09:03.844 --> 09:09.750
OH. I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST REALLY BEAT.

09:09.750 --> 09:13.624
ALL THAT HARD WORK REALLY
TOOK IT OUT ON YOU, HUH?

09:14.985 --> 09:16.987
WELL, HEY...

09:16.987 --> 09:20.761
MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT WILL RELAX YOU.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.663
HELLO.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.694
IS THAT A GUN
IN YOUR POCKET,

09:23.694 --> 09:25.696
OR ARE YOU JUST HAPPY
TO SEE ME?

09:27.267 --> 09:29.700
OH, MY GOD.
IT IS A GUN.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.702
YOU'VE GOT A GUN
IN YOUR POCKET?

09:31.702 --> 09:33.804
SUSAN, DON'T FREAK OUT.

09:33.804 --> 09:35.105
WHY DO YOU HAVE A GUN?

09:35.105 --> 09:38.649
(sighs) SIT DOWN.

09:38.649 --> 09:40.611
I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.917
(footsteps approach)

09:46.917 --> 09:50.691
DID YOU MEAN
WHAT YOU SAID TODAY?

09:50.691 --> 09:51.862
KAREN.

09:51.862 --> 09:53.323
ABOUT HELPING ME
WITH ANYTHING I NEED?

09:53.323 --> 09:56.066
'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT,
BUT THEY DON'T MEAN IT.

09:56.066 --> 09:57.898
NO. NO, I MEANT IT.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.800
YOU SURE?
BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.772
YOU AND I NEVER
REALLY LIKED EACH OTHER.

10:01.772 --> 10:03.804
WE HAVEN'T?
 NO.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.175
WELL, I DEFINITELY MEANT
WHAT I SAID.

10:05.175 --> 10:07.678
WHATEVER YOU NEED,
CONSIDER IT DONE.

10:07.678 --> 10:10.010
GOOD. I WANT YOU
TO HELP KILL ME.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.142
(loud clank, water sloshes)

10:12.142 --> 10:16.987
UM... MAYBE WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THIS INSIDE.

10:16.987 --> 10:21.722
KAREN, YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY
BE CONSIDERING THIS.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.354
LISTEN, CANCER'S A BULLY,

10:24.354 --> 10:25.896
AND WHEN IT'S AS BAD
AS MINE,

10:25.896 --> 10:28.198
IT LAUGHS AT
OUR PATHETIC LITTLE ATTEMPTS

10:28.198 --> 10:29.700
TO FIGHT IT.

10:29.700 --> 10:33.033
SO HERE'S HOW I WIN--

10:33.033 --> 10:35.736
BY MAKING SURE
THAT I'M THE ONE

10:35.736 --> 10:39.740
THAT SAYS WHEN AND HOW
I GO.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.272
SO... WILL YOU HELP ME?

10:42.272 --> 10:44.815
(sighs)

10:44.815 --> 10:46.416
WHAT DOES ROY THINK?

10:46.416 --> 10:48.648
WELL, ROY WAS THE FIRST ONE
I WENT TO.

10:48.648 --> 10:52.652
HE COULDN'T DO IT.
TOO MUCH OF A MARSHMALLOW.

10:52.652 --> 10:56.086
I NEED SOMEONE
COLD AND HEARTLESS.

10:56.086 --> 10:57.387
AND THAT'S ME?

10:57.387 --> 10:59.029
A DYING WOMAN'S SITTING
IN FRONT OF YOU,

10:59.029 --> 11:00.090
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN OFFERED
A CUP OF COFFEE.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.662
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YA?

11:05.936 --> 11:09.770
(whispers) I DON'T...
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD DO THAT.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.101
(exhales deeply)

11:11.101 --> 11:13.673
I DON'T WANT TO DIE ALONE,
BREE.

11:13.673 --> 11:17.177
AND THE CHEMO'S
JUST KICKING MY ASS.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.080
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE AWAY
IN SOME HOSPITAL BED.

11:22.112 --> 11:25.455
PLEASE HELP ME GO
THE WAY I WANT TO.

11:30.260 --> 11:32.192
ALL RIGHT.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.894
I'LL HELP YOU.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.813
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING,
MR. AND MRS. DELFINO.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.885
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

11:54.885 --> 11:56.847
MY HUSBAND DID SOMETHING
REALLY STUPID,

11:56.847 --> 11:58.448
AND NOW WE NEED
POLICE PROTECTION.

11:58.448 --> 12:00.050
SUSAN, PLEASE,
JUST LET ME HANDLE THIS.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.491
AND BY "HANDLE THIS,"
HE MEANS,

12:01.491 --> 12:03.894
"STARE OUT THE WINDOW
WITH A GUN IN HIS PANTS."

12:03.894 --> 12:07.928
COULD YOU... START
FROM THE BEGINNING, PLEASE?

12:07.928 --> 12:10.260
A BUDDY OF MINE--
AND I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHO--

12:10.260 --> 12:12.262
BORROWED SOME MONEY
FROM A LOAN SHARK,

12:12.262 --> 12:13.934
AND THINGS GOT
A LITTLE OUT OF HAND,

12:13.934 --> 12:14.935
AND I HAD TO HELP HIM OUT.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.006
OH, AND BY "HELP HIM OUT,"
HE MEANS

12:16.006 --> 12:19.009
"BEAT UP A MOB GUY, PUTTING
OUR WHOLE FAMILY IN DANGER."

12:19.009 --> 12:20.440
DOES YOUR FRIEND KNOW
IT'S ILLEGAL

12:20.440 --> 12:22.342
TO USE THE SERVICES
OF A LOAN SHARK?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.815
HE DOES.

12:24.815 --> 12:26.246
DO YOU KNOW IT'S ILLEGAL
TO ASSAULT SOMEONE?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.879
THE GUY WAS BREAKING
INTO OUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE.

12:28.879 --> 12:29.980
I TRIED TO GET HIM TO LEAVE,
HE THREW A PUNCH,

12:29.980 --> 12:31.321
AND I DEFENDED MYSELF.

12:31.321 --> 12:33.984
AND NOW THIS LOWLIFE WANTS
TO KILL MY HUSBAND,

12:33.984 --> 12:36.086
SO YOU NEED TO ARREST HIM.
 WELL, IF YOU HAD CALLED US

12:36.086 --> 12:38.258
AFTER HE BROKE
INTO YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE,

12:38.258 --> 12:39.790
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE.

12:39.790 --> 12:44.434
OH. SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
SMARTER TO CALL THE COPS

12:44.434 --> 12:47.097
INSTEAD OF SLAPPING
JIMMY KNUCKLES

12:47.097 --> 12:48.438
AROUND THE LIVING ROOM.
HUH.

12:48.438 --> 12:51.802
WHERE HAVE
I HEARD THAT BEFORE?

12:51.802 --> 12:54.544
OH, THAT'S RIGHT--
FROM ME.

12:54.544 --> 12:56.907
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A GUN?

12:56.907 --> 12:59.109
DO YOU HAVE A PERMIT
FOR A GUN, SIR?

12:59.109 --> 13:00.851
ALL RIGHT, DETECTIVE, I THINK
WE'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

13:00.851 --> 13:02.052
I CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS.

13:02.052 --> 13:04.314
NO, MIKE. YOU'VE BEEN
TAKING CARE OF IT,

13:04.314 --> 13:05.956
AND LOOK WHERE IT GOT US.

13:05.956 --> 13:08.018
WE HAVE A 9-YEAR-OLD SON.

13:08.018 --> 13:12.062
OKAY. OKAY, LOOK,
HERE'S WHAT I CAN DO.

13:12.062 --> 13:13.493
WE HAVE YOUR ADDRESS.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.495
I'LL MAKE SURE THE PATROL CAR
KEEPS AN EYE ON THINGS.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.798
AND IF YOU SEE THIS GUY,
 CALL US.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.101
WAIT. THAT'S IT?

13:21.101 --> 13:22.272
MA'AM, I'M AFRAID
THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO

13:22.272 --> 13:24.204
UNTIL SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.577
GREAT. WELL,
MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY,

13:27.577 --> 13:29.980
AND SOMETHING ELSE
WILL HAPPEN.

13:32.282 --> 13:33.313
(door opens)

13:39.019 --> 13:39.990
HONEY,
THERE'S FRESH COFFEE.

13:39.990 --> 13:41.992
YOU WANT ME TO PUT SOME
IN A TRAVEL MUG?

13:41.992 --> 13:43.123
OKAY.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.824
(sighs) WHAT'S WRONG?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.026
30 DAYS
WITH THE REHAB HIPPIES,

13:46.026 --> 13:48.028
AND YOU'VE ALREADY FORGOTTEN
HOW TO TIE A TIE?

13:48.028 --> 13:49.399
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.361
I'VE WORN A TIE EVERY DAY
FOR 25 YEARS,

13:51.361 --> 13:56.036
AND I'VE ALWAYS HATED THE WAY
IT FEELS AROUND MY NECK.

13:56.036 --> 14:00.110
SO? I WEAR LOTS
OF UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS--

14:00.110 --> 14:02.913
HIGH-HEELED SHOES, BRAS THAT
MASH MY BOOBS TOGETHER.

14:02.913 --> 14:04.915
I'M STARTING TO THINK
THAT A TIE

14:04.915 --> 14:07.077
IS BASICALLY
JUST A FANCY NOOSE.

14:07.077 --> 14:10.350
OH, HONEY.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.053
YOU'RE NOT NERVOUS ABOUT
YOUR FIRST DAY BACK, ARE YOU?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.124
(sighs)

14:14.124 --> 14:16.056
I DON'T KNOW.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.528
I JUST THOUGHT I'D BE
MORE EXCITED THAN I AM.

14:18.528 --> 14:19.559
WELL, YOU'RE THE BOSS.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.131
YOU WANT EXCITEMENT,
SHAKE THINGS UP.

14:21.131 --> 14:22.432
BUY A NEW XEROX MACHINE

14:22.432 --> 14:25.165
OR GET SOME POST-ITS
IN CRAZY COLORS.

14:25.165 --> 14:29.199
TAKE THE STAFF TO HAPPY HOUR.
GET STINKING DRUNK.

14:29.199 --> 14:30.941
OKAY, MAYBE NOT
THE STINKING DRUNK PART,

14:30.941 --> 14:32.542
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.104
I GOTTA GET THE GIRLS
TO SCHOOL.

14:34.104 --> 14:36.206
(mug clatters)
 SEE YOU TONIGHT.

14:36.206 --> 14:38.308
(sighs)

14:42.212 --> 14:44.284
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO FIGHT THAT WOMAN

14:44.284 --> 14:45.956
OVER A PAIR OF BOOTS.

14:45.956 --> 14:48.188
I SAW 'EM FIRST.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.519
ON HER FEET.

14:49.519 --> 14:51.591
SORRY. I SHOP NEW YORK STYLE.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.323
UNTIL SOMEONE IS EITHER
BRUISED OR BLEEDING,

14:53.323 --> 14:55.125
NO SALE IS FINAL.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.126
(sighs)

14:56.126 --> 14:57.167
(telephone rings)

14:57.167 --> 15:00.130
(sighs)

15:00.130 --> 15:01.131
(beep)

15:01.131 --> 15:03.903
HELLO?

15:03.903 --> 15:07.107
OH, HI, KAREN.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.179
(lowered voice) NO.
NO, NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

15:09.179 --> 15:12.182
UH, RENEE'S VISITING.

15:12.182 --> 15:14.144
WELL, UH, I'M OPEN TOMORROW.

15:14.144 --> 15:17.447
PERHAPS I COULD
EUTHANIZE YOU IN THE MORNING.

15:17.447 --> 15:20.220
GREAT. I WILL SEE YOU THEN.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.353
SO I COULDN'T HELP
BUT OVERHEAR.
 (gasps)

15:23.353 --> 15:26.196
(sighs)

15:26.196 --> 15:30.160
IT'S KAREN.
HER CANCER'S SPREADING.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.461
OH, NO.
 YEAH.

15:34.164 --> 15:38.038
SHE'S... DEPRESSED AND...

15:38.038 --> 15:41.071
WANTS ME TO HELP HER
DIE WITH DIGNITY.

15:41.071 --> 15:43.413
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?

15:43.413 --> 15:44.674
OF COURSE NOT.

15:44.674 --> 15:46.416
SHE JUST GOT
DEVASTATING NEWS.

15:46.416 --> 15:48.618
SHE'S IN A STATE OF SHOCK.

15:48.618 --> 15:50.120
I'M JUST TRYING TO
STRING HER ALONG

15:50.120 --> 15:53.653
AND BUY SOME TIME UNTIL
SHE'S THINKING CLEARLY AGAIN.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.285
THINK THAT'LL WORK?

15:55.285 --> 15:57.957
(sighs) IT'S GOT TO.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.559
BY THE WAY, TO HELP HER
KEEP HER MIND OFF IT,

15:59.559 --> 16:03.263
I'M HAVING PEOPLE STOP BY
AND HAVE TEA,

16:03.263 --> 16:05.095
YOU KNOW,
PLAY SCRABBLE WITH HER,

16:05.095 --> 16:07.267
MAYBE GIVE HER
A FOOT MASSAGE.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.300
DO YOU THINK TOMORROW
MAYBE YOU COULD STOP BY AND--

16:10.300 --> 16:11.541
BREE, IF I TOUCH
THAT WOMAN'S FEET,

16:11.541 --> 16:14.074
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO EUTHANIZE ME.

16:15.205 --> 16:17.507
(exhales deeply)

16:17.507 --> 16:20.050
(girl) BILLY, WHERE ARE YOU?

16:20.050 --> 16:21.351
(children shouting playfully)

16:21.351 --> 16:25.055
(girl) OH, LOOK, LOOK! THERE'S
A GOLD! COME ON! THE GOLD!

16:25.055 --> 16:26.356
AAH! HI!

16:26.356 --> 16:28.118
(giggles)

16:28.118 --> 16:29.159
MOM?

16:29.159 --> 16:30.360
YEAH?

16:30.360 --> 16:33.393
THIS PARTY IS AMAZING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

16:33.393 --> 16:36.426
OH, I JUST WANTED YOUR BIRTHDAY
TO BE PERFECT. (kiss)

16:36.426 --> 16:37.627
(chuckles)
 (car door closes)

16:37.627 --> 16:39.429
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PENNY.

16:39.429 --> 16:41.371
THEN AGAIN,
NOTHING'S PERFECT.

16:41.371 --> 16:43.503
HEY, JANE. TOM WENT
TO PICK UP THE CAKE,

16:43.503 --> 16:46.005
SO IF YOU WANNA WAIT
IN THE CAR OR...

16:47.207 --> 16:50.140
OH! I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE BRINGING A GUEST.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.142
ACTUALLY, THIS IS MY GIFT
FOR PENNY.

16:52.142 --> 16:53.283
A GEISHA?

16:53.283 --> 16:56.046
MY NIECE CINDY.
SHE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER.

16:56.046 --> 16:59.089
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:59.089 --> 17:00.350
SHE'S GONNA TAKE PICTURES
OF THE PARTY,

17:00.350 --> 17:03.423
AND THEN... I'M GONNA MAKE
A LITTLE MEMORY BOOK.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.454
COOL!

17:04.454 --> 17:05.555
I KNEW YOU WOULD LOVE IT.

17:05.555 --> 17:09.098
(chuckles) COME HERE.

17:09.098 --> 17:12.301
(camera shutter clicks)
 FUNNY FACES? (gasps)

17:12.301 --> 17:13.203
(click)
 PERFECT.

17:13.203 --> 17:15.265
(Penny and Jane laugh)

17:15.265 --> 17:19.069
♪♪♪

17:19.069 --> 17:20.609

17:20.609 --> 17:23.673
♪♪♪

17:23.673 --> 17:26.276

17:26.276 --> 17:29.279

17:33.052 --> 17:35.425

17:35.425 --> 17:37.327
MMM!

17:37.327 --> 17:39.589
(exhales deeply)

17:39.589 --> 17:41.661
(camera shutter clicks)

17:41.661 --> 17:46.466
(chuckling) CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

17:46.466 --> 17:49.839
(children shouting playfully
in distance)

17:49.839 --> 17:52.342
OKAY.
 (door closes)

17:52.342 --> 17:54.174
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:54.174 --> 17:56.376
JUST MAKING SURE
I'M IN THE MEMORY BOOK.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.578
YOU'RE INVADING EVERY PHOTO
THAT PENNY AND I ARE IN.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.311
I'M HER MOTHER.
MAYBE YOU'RE THE INVADER.

18:01.311 --> 18:02.552
AND WE'RE BACK TO THIS.

18:02.552 --> 18:04.554
I SPENT WEEKS
PLANNING THIS PARTY,

18:04.554 --> 18:06.256
MAKING IT PERFECT FOR HER,
AND THEN YOU COME IN

18:06.256 --> 18:08.118
AND UPSTAGE ME?
(imitates camera shutter click)

18:08.118 --> 18:11.121
I'M JUST TRYING TO FORGE
A RELATIONSHIP WITH PENNY.

18:11.121 --> 18:13.423
WELL, STOP FORGING.
YOU'RE NOT FAMILY.

18:13.423 --> 18:15.525
YOU'RE JUST SOME WOMAN
HER FATHER IS...

18:16.696 --> 18:18.198
"SEEING."

18:18.198 --> 18:19.529
WELL... (sighs)

18:19.529 --> 18:21.401
"WELL," WHAT?

18:21.401 --> 18:22.672
WELL...

18:22.672 --> 18:24.404
THAT'S NOT ALL I AM.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.105
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:26.105 --> 18:30.380
(sighs) YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY TALK TO TOM.

18:30.380 --> 18:31.441
(door opens, girls shouting
playfully in distance)

18:31.441 --> 18:32.542
(closes door)

18:34.444 --> 18:35.745
TOM'S NOT HERE,
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME

18:35.745 --> 18:37.347
WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

18:37.347 --> 18:39.519
OKAY.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.120
I REALLY DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HEAR THIS FROM ME,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.423
BUT SINCE
YOU'RE INSISTING...

18:43.423 --> 18:45.295
TOM ASKED ME
TO MOVE IN WITH HIM.

18:47.397 --> 18:50.330
SO NOW YOU KNOW.

18:50.330 --> 18:54.434
(door opens)

18:54.434 --> 18:57.207
(door closes)

19:03.213 --> 19:04.244
SORRY!

19:04.244 --> 19:07.277
THE CAKE TOOK LONGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

19:08.578 --> 19:09.649
WHAT?

19:09.649 --> 19:10.880
THIS IS HOW I FIND OUT

19:10.880 --> 19:12.822
YOU AND JANE ARE GOING TO
LIVE TOGETHER? FROM HER?

19:12.822 --> 19:16.486
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO. SHE WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO SAY ANYTHING.

19:16.486 --> 19:18.228
WELL, SHE DIDN'T GET THE MEMO
BECAUSE SHE DID SAY SOMETHING

19:18.228 --> 19:20.360
IN MY HOUSE--THE HOUSE
YOU AND I LIVED IN.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.292
I DIDN'T DESERVE THAT.

19:22.292 --> 19:24.834
I AM SO SORRY, LYNETTE.

19:26.696 --> 19:29.168
I REALLY NEED TO PUT
THIS CAKE DOWN.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.441
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

19:31.441 --> 19:32.802
I TRIED THE OTHER DAY,

19:32.802 --> 19:34.774
BUT PENNY WANTED TO
OPEN HER PRESENT,

19:34.774 --> 19:36.846
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO RUIN HER BIRTHDAY.

19:36.846 --> 19:38.548
GOD, TOM.

19:38.548 --> 19:40.950
YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN HER
THREE MONTHS.

19:40.950 --> 19:43.353
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE FUTURE,

19:43.353 --> 19:45.855
AND LIVING TOGETHER
IS THE NEXT STEP.

19:45.855 --> 19:48.187
OH, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT STEPS NOW?

19:48.187 --> 19:50.560
JEEZ, I WONDER WHAT
THE STEP AFTER THAT COULD BE.

19:50.560 --> 19:51.791
WE HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT THAT.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.363
(chuckles) THAT'S GOOD,

19:53.363 --> 19:55.525
SINCE YOU AND I AREN'T
EVEN DIVORCED YET.
 I KNOW.

19:55.525 --> 19:58.368
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK
TO A LAWYER OR SOMETHING

19:58.368 --> 19:59.569
THIS WEEK.

20:05.775 --> 20:07.277
REALLY?

20:10.310 --> 20:12.882
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A TRIAL SEPARATION,

20:12.882 --> 20:18.888
TO SEE HOW WE DID APART,
TO SEE IF WE COULD BE HAPPY.

20:18.888 --> 20:21.291
(sighs)

20:21.291 --> 20:23.523
THAT'S THE THING.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.954
I AM HAPPY.

20:26.996 --> 20:29.699
AND IF YOU'RE NOT,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

20:31.601 --> 20:33.263
CAN I GET A PICTURE
OF MOM AND DAD?

20:52.282 --> 20:53.483
(gasps)

20:53.483 --> 20:55.925
KAREN, WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING?!

20:55.925 --> 20:58.358
I LOST A CONTACT.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.591
OH, MY GOD. YOU WERE HOPING
I WOULD RUN YOU OVER.

21:01.591 --> 21:03.433
WELL, WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?
YOU SAID YOU'D HELP ME,

21:03.433 --> 21:05.264
AND THEN YOU KEEP
BLOWING ME OFF.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.767
NOW ARE YOU GONNA KILL ME
TODAY OR WHAT?

21:07.767 --> 21:10.940
NO, I CANNOT KILL YOU TODAY.
I HAVE PILATES.

21:10.940 --> 21:13.673
YOU KNOW, BREE, IT SOUNDS
LIKE WE'RE JUST PLAYING GAMES.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.776
KAREN,
I REALLY WANNA DO THIS.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.610
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO,
BUT... LET'S GO FOR TOMORROW.

21:20.610 --> 21:21.951
NO EXCUSES.

21:21.951 --> 21:23.953
REALLY?

21:23.953 --> 21:25.455
REALLY.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.791
'CAUSE I'M SERIOUS
ABOUT DOING THIS--

21:31.791 --> 21:34.063
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

21:34.063 --> 21:35.695
(sighs)

21:39.028 --> 21:41.471
(cell phone rings)

21:41.471 --> 21:42.602
(beep)

21:42.602 --> 21:43.633
HELLO?

21:43.633 --> 21:45.004
(whispering) Mrs. Solis?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.976
IT'S MARILYN,
YOUR HUSBAND'S SECRETARY.

21:46.976 --> 21:49.078
(whispering) HI, MARILYN.
WHY ARE WE WHISPERING?

21:49.078 --> 21:51.310
I DON'T WANT MR. SOLIS
TO KNOW I'M CALLING YOU.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.412
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?

21:52.412 --> 21:53.943
UH...

21:53.943 --> 21:56.045
HE'S BEEN ACTING
A LITTLE STRANGE,

21:56.045 --> 22:00.089
AND I JUST REALLY NEED YOU
TO COME DOWN HERE.

22:00.089 --> 22:01.691
HE'S COMING.
 (receiver clatters)

22:05.695 --> 22:08.097
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

22:08.097 --> 22:09.829
EXCUSE ME.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.901
MARILYN,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:11.901 --> 22:14.464
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HE'S GIVING AWAY ALL OUR MONEY!

22:14.464 --> 22:16.005
WHO'S THIS GUY?

22:16.005 --> 22:18.408
PATRICK McDONALD,
OUR C.F.O.

22:18.408 --> 22:20.009
DO YOU SEE
ALL THESE PEOPLE?

22:20.009 --> 22:22.111
A WHILE BACK, WE TOOK OVER
A STEEL COMPANY,

22:22.111 --> 22:23.943
CHOPPED IT UP, SOLD IT,
MADE A NICE PROFIT.

22:23.943 --> 22:27.977
(lowered voice) THESE ARE SOME
OF THE WORKERS WHO GOT LAID OFF.

22:27.977 --> 22:30.119
(lowered voice) OKAY,
SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

22:30.119 --> 22:34.023
CARLOS HAS TAKEN IT UPON HIMSELF
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT

22:34.023 --> 22:38.057
BY WRITING EACH OF THEM A CHECK
FOR $50,000.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.361
UH... OKAY.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.033
EXCUSE ME.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.436
EXCUSE ME.

22:46.436 --> 22:48.768
(speaking inaudibly)

22:48.768 --> 22:50.700
OH, BOY.
 HE KEEPS THIS UP,

22:50.700 --> 22:52.742
AND WE'LL BE BANKRUPT
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

22:52.742 --> 22:54.744
UH, MRS. SOLIS,

22:54.744 --> 22:58.147
I'M A PARTY GIRL WITH A TASTE
FOR YOUNG BRAZILIAN GENTLEMEN.

22:58.147 --> 22:59.979
I REALLY NEED THIS JOB.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.681
I'M ON IT.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.156
HONEY?

23:07.156 --> 23:09.018
HEY, BABE,
TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

23:09.018 --> 23:10.520
MY ADVICE?

23:10.520 --> 23:11.821
YOU TOLD ME
TO SHAKE THINGS UP,

23:11.821 --> 23:14.594
SO I DECIDED TO MAKE WORK
A PLACE I WANT TO BE.

23:16.426 --> 23:17.927
(rip)
 HOPE THIS HELPS.

23:17.927 --> 23:22.572
AND REMEMBER, YOU CAN BE
ANYTHING YOU WANNA BE.

23:22.572 --> 23:25.074
NOTHING IS OUT OF REACH.

23:25.074 --> 23:26.706
WHAT DO YOU SAY, SKIP?

23:26.706 --> 23:29.038
THANKS, MISTER.

23:29.038 --> 23:30.680
HONEY, THIS IS HOW
YOU SHAKE THINGS UP?

23:30.680 --> 23:32.612
BY GIVING AWAY
ALL THE COMPANY MONEY?

23:32.612 --> 23:34.514
OH, ACTUALLY, I WAS AFRAID THAT
PATRICK WOULD PUT A STOP PAYMENT

23:34.514 --> 23:36.716
SO I DECIDED TO START USING
OUR PERSONAL ACCOUNT.

23:36.716 --> 23:39.549
ALL RIGHT, RUN ALONG,
TINY TIM.

23:39.549 --> 23:41.591
OKAY, LET'S GO.

23:45.154 --> 23:46.796
SWEETHEART...

23:46.796 --> 23:49.999
YOU CAN BE HONEST WITH ME.

23:49.999 --> 23:51.731
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING
AGAIN?

23:51.731 --> 23:54.203
NOPE. HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK
IN 34 DAYS.

23:54.203 --> 23:57.136
THEN WHY THE HELL ARE YOU
ACTING LIKE A CRAZY PERSON?!

23:57.136 --> 23:59.068
YOU THINK THIS IS CRAZY?

23:59.068 --> 24:01.010
(closes drawer)

24:01.010 --> 24:02.612
NO.
 (pen clatters)

24:02.612 --> 24:06.716
WHAT'S CRAZY IS MAKING A FORTUNE
OFF OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MISERY

24:06.716 --> 24:09.579
WITHOUT THINKING FOR ONE MINUTE
HOW THEY'RE SUFFERING.

24:09.579 --> 24:13.182
WHAT'S CRAZY IS THINKING
YOU CAN FIND HAPPINESS

24:13.182 --> 24:16.155
IN A PAYCHECK OR BEHIND
THE WHEEL OF A SPORTS CAR.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.157
WHAT'S CRAZY IS THINKING THAT

24:18.157 --> 24:21.891
YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING
IMPORTANT WITH YOUR LIFE

24:21.891 --> 24:24.163
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE WEARING A TIE.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.640
(door opens)

24:38.247 --> 24:39.609
(knocking continues)

24:39.609 --> 24:41.180
WHAT?

24:41.180 --> 24:43.513
I'M TRYING TO FIND BEN.
HE'S NOT AT HIS HOUSE.

24:43.513 --> 24:44.684
IS HE HERE?
 NO.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.985
WHAT DO YOU NEED BEN FOR?

24:45.985 --> 24:48.758
I WANT HIM TO TELL ME
WHERE THAT LOAN SHARK LIVES

24:48.758 --> 24:50.990
SO I CAN GO TO HIS HOUSE.
 TO DO WHAT?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.992
I DON'T KNOW. MAY-MAYBE I'LL
GIVE HIM SOME MONEY.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.223
MAYBE I'LL KILL HIM.
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

24:54.223 --> 24:56.766
OKAY, SWEETIE,
YOU'RE A LITTLE WORKED UP.

24:56.766 --> 24:58.698
SIT DOWN. I'LL POUR YOU
A GLASS OF WINE.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.870
NO, I HAVE TO FIX THIS.
I'M TERRIFIED.

25:00.870 --> 25:02.832
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN DAYS.

25:02.832 --> 25:06.175
AND MY HUSBAND IS WALKING
AROUND OUR HOUSE WITH A GUN.

25:06.175 --> 25:07.807
OOH, SORRY.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.108
WHY ARE YOU APOLOGIZING?

25:09.108 --> 25:11.541
MIKE'S THE ONE WHO STARTED
THIS MESS.

25:11.541 --> 25:13.983
YOU MEAN WHEN HE STUCK
HIS NECK OUT FOR BEN

25:13.983 --> 25:16.646
AND PROTECTED ME? IS THAT
THE MESS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

25:16.646 --> 25:18.287
(sighs)

25:18.287 --> 25:20.920
LOOK, WHEN YOU'VE BEEN BURNED
BY MEN AS OFTEN AS I HAVE,

25:20.920 --> 25:24.624
YOU STOP BELIEVING
IN THAT FAIRY TALE IDEA

25:24.624 --> 25:27.927
OF THE GUY ON THE WHITE HORSE
WHO COMES IN TO SAVE YOU.

25:27.927 --> 25:32.031
BUT... MEETING MIKE AND SEEING
HOW HE IS AS A HUSBAND

25:32.031 --> 25:35.765
AND A FATHER AND A FRIEND,

25:35.765 --> 25:39.038
WELL...
HE GOT ME BELIEVING AGAIN.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.811
SUSAN...

25:41.811 --> 25:44.874
HE IS A GOOD MAN.

25:44.874 --> 25:47.617
YOU REALLY THINK THAT?

25:47.617 --> 25:50.179
OR ARE YOU JUST TRYING
TO CALM ME DOWN?

25:50.179 --> 25:52.151
I REALLY THINK THAT.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.053
AND I REALLY WANNA
CALM YOU DOWN.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.185
SO IF I POUR THIS GLASS
OF WINE,

25:56.185 --> 25:58.688
WILL YOU NOT GO
AND KILL ANYONE?

25:58.688 --> 26:01.230
OKAY.

26:01.230 --> 26:03.893
OKAY.

26:03.893 --> 26:06.065
(cork pops)

26:08.798 --> 26:12.271
BREE! HOW YOU DOING?
KAREN'S TAKING A NAP.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.843
ACTUALLY, IT'S YOU
I WANNA TALK TO.

26:13.843 --> 26:15.044
MAY I COME IN?

26:15.044 --> 26:16.776
SURE.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.251
MMM! THAT PIE
SMELLS WONDERFUL.

26:22.251 --> 26:24.884
YEAH. KAREN MADE RHUBARB.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.756
SHE KNOWS I DON'T LIKE IT.

26:26.756 --> 26:27.787
HOW COULD YOU NOT LIKE IT?

26:27.787 --> 26:29.719
IT'S THE ONE PIE
SHE MAKES BETTER THAN I DO.

26:29.719 --> 26:32.291
WELL, MAY I CUT YOU
A SLICE?

26:32.291 --> 26:34.163
SURE.

26:34.163 --> 26:35.865
SO...

26:35.865 --> 26:37.667
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:37.667 --> 26:41.600
(silverware clatters)
 WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM
ON OUR HANDS.

26:45.835 --> 26:47.606
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE ASKED YOU TO DO THIS.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.308
SHE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE YOU.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.140
(mouth full) YES,
WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT ALREADY.

26:51.140 --> 26:53.983
I FIGURED WHEN I SAID NO,
THAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT.

26:53.983 --> 26:56.085
NO, SHE SEEMS MORE DETERMINED
THAN EVER.

26:56.085 --> 26:58.017
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

26:58.017 --> 26:59.188
WHAT?

26:59.188 --> 27:01.691
THAT'S MY SUICIDE PIE.

27:01.691 --> 27:03.893
YOUR WHAT?
 I MADE IT TO KILL MYSELF.

27:03.893 --> 27:06.656
IT'S FULL OF SLEEPING PILLS
AND TRANQUILIZERS,

27:06.656 --> 27:08.698
AND A BOTTLE
OF LIQUID SOMETHING.

27:08.698 --> 27:11.931
OH, MY GOD.
I ATE TWO PIECES!

27:11.931 --> 27:13.963
OH, I'M SO SORRY, BREE.

27:15.905 --> 27:17.737
SO YOU WANNA GO TO THE HOSPITAL
OR SOMETHIN'?

27:17.737 --> 27:20.309
YES, I WANNA GO
TO THE HOSPITAL!

27:22.772 --> 27:26.275
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
MAKING SUICIDE PIES?

27:26.275 --> 27:28.848
WELL, IF YOU TWO WOULD GROW
A PAIR AND HELP ME OUT...

27:28.848 --> 27:30.950
OH, SURE, I'M THE PROBLEM

27:30.950 --> 27:33.222
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA
MURDER MY WIFE.

27:33.222 --> 27:34.824
CAN WE PLEASE CONTINUE THIS
IN THE CAR?

27:34.824 --> 27:35.885
IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,

27:35.885 --> 27:38.027
WE NEED TO GET
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM NOW!

27:40.830 --> 27:42.792
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY.

27:42.792 --> 27:44.663
SHE CAN'T MAKE
A 3-POINT TURN.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.065
I CAN MAKE
A 3-POINT TURN.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.666
THIS IS JUST EASIER.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.768
OKAY, CAN WE JUST PLEASE
STAY FOCUSED

27:48.768 --> 27:50.439
ON GETTING TO THE HOSPITAL?

27:50.439 --> 27:52.271
AND F.Y.I.--
YOUR TURN SIGNAL IS ON.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.673
YEAH, I'M GONNA MAKE A LEFT
UP ON OAKHURST.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.845
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE
THE INTERSTATE?

27:55.845 --> 27:57.847
WOULDN'T THAT BE FASTER?
 SHE CAN'T MERGE.

27:57.847 --> 28:01.250
I CAN MERGE. THE INTERSTATE
IS ALWAYS JAMMED.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.882
PLUS I GOTTA STOP
AND GET GAS.

28:02.882 --> 28:06.385
OKAY, THAT'S IT. STOP!
STOP THE CAR!

28:06.385 --> 28:07.917
(tires screech)

28:10.259 --> 28:12.691
UGH!

28:12.691 --> 28:15.825
GET OUT! I'M DRIVING.
(sighs)

28:15.825 --> 28:17.797
THERE'S NO NEED TO GET
SO NASTY.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.268
I HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO GET NASTY.

28:19.268 --> 28:20.800
YOU POISONED ME!

28:20.800 --> 28:23.172
MAKING THAT PIE WAS
A STUPID THING TO DO.

28:23.172 --> 28:24.974
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH!

28:24.974 --> 28:26.836
OH, YES, I DO.

28:26.836 --> 28:29.839
THREE MONTHS AGO, I WAS
THIS CLOSE TO KILLING MYSELF.

28:29.839 --> 28:32.081
IT WAS A QUICK FIX
ON A VERY DEPRESSING NIGHT.

28:32.081 --> 28:33.843
BUT IN THE MORNING,
I REALIZED

28:33.843 --> 28:36.145
IT WAS THE MOST SELFISH THING
I COULD DO.

28:36.145 --> 28:40.019
IT'S NOT THE SAME.
YOU WEREN'T DYING. I AM.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.350
I KNOW.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.823
BUT IF YOU TAKE YOUR LIFE,
IT'LL RUIN THE MEMORY

28:43.823 --> 28:45.995
OF EVERYTHING YOU WERE
BEFORE THAT.

28:45.995 --> 28:48.928
IT'S ALL ANYONE WILL REMEMBER.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.729
LOOK AT ROY.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.002
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANNA DO
TO THE MAN WHO LOVES YOU?

28:53.002 --> 28:57.106
BABY, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO
BEFORE YOUR TIME.

29:00.109 --> 29:01.871
OKAY.

29:01.871 --> 29:03.873
I'LL STICK AROUND
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.919
OHH, THAT'S LOVELY,

29:09.919 --> 29:13.282
BUT WE STILL NEED TO GET
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

29:13.282 --> 29:14.924
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.

29:14.924 --> 29:16.025
(sighs)

29:16.025 --> 29:17.026
(engine starts)

29:17.026 --> 29:19.128
(tires peal)

29:26.035 --> 29:27.436
(clatters)

29:27.436 --> 29:28.767
(doorbell rings)

29:28.767 --> 29:30.970
IT'S OPEN!

29:30.970 --> 29:32.842
(door opens, dishes clatter)

29:32.842 --> 29:34.844
(door closes)
 AH.

29:34.844 --> 29:36.976
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
SHARE WITH ME TODAY?

29:36.976 --> 29:39.408
THE RESULTS
FROM MY COLONOSCOPY?

29:39.408 --> 29:41.110
MY MOM DIED?

29:41.110 --> 29:44.984
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
WHAT I DID.

29:44.984 --> 29:48.117
IT WAS WRONG,
AND I'M TRULY SORRY.

29:48.117 --> 29:52.361
(water splashes)

29:52.361 --> 29:56.065
(clatter)

29:56.065 --> 29:57.867
ARE THOSE THE CHEESE PUFFS
I BROUGHT?

29:57.867 --> 29:59.328
YEAH. I GUESS
NOBODY LIKED 'EM.

29:59.328 --> 30:03.532
(sighs) WELL, MORE FOR ME.

30:03.532 --> 30:04.904
(dishes clatter)

30:04.904 --> 30:09.508
23 YEARS I'VE BEEN MARRIED
TO THE MAN. 23 YEARS.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.811
AND THEN WE HIT A ROUGH PATCH,
AND WE STUMBLED,

30:12.811 --> 30:15.284
AND THEN HE FINDS YOU--
 I TOTALLY GET IT.

30:15.284 --> 30:16.545
I'M TALKING!

30:16.545 --> 30:18.487
(dish clatters, water splashes)

30:18.487 --> 30:20.990
HE FINDS YOU,

30:20.990 --> 30:25.424
AND IT KIND OF MAKES HIM
STOP TRYING TO FIND ME AGAIN.

30:27.156 --> 30:28.998
AND THEN WHEN
SOMEONE HAS TO TELL ME

30:28.998 --> 30:30.829
THAT YOU'RE MOVING IN
TOGETHER,

30:30.829 --> 30:34.563
AND WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

30:34.563 --> 30:36.065
YOU DO IT.

30:36.065 --> 30:37.606
I SAID I'M SORRY.

30:37.606 --> 30:40.369
AND IT ALMOST
SOUNDED SINCERE.

30:43.242 --> 30:46.845
FINE.
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.079
I ONLY CAME BECAUSE
TOM ASKED ME TO APOLOGIZE.

30:50.079 --> 30:52.121
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME.

30:52.121 --> 30:53.182
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.
YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

30:53.182 --> 30:54.523
(dishes clatter)

30:54.523 --> 30:56.325
I THINK YOU'RE SNEAKY,
JANE.

30:56.325 --> 31:00.890
I THINK EVERYTHING YOU DO,
YOU DO ON PURPOSE.

31:00.890 --> 31:03.132
I THINK YOU COULDN'T WAIT
TO SEE THE LOOK ON MY FACE

31:03.132 --> 31:05.534
WHEN YOU TOLD ME YOU AND TOM
WERE MOVING IN TOGETHER.

31:05.534 --> 31:07.166
I THINK YOU ACTUALLY
LIKED IT.

31:07.166 --> 31:10.039
I THINK YOU ENJOYED IT.
I-I THINK--

31:10.039 --> 31:11.240
(pounds)

31:19.108 --> 31:20.079
(choking)

31:25.584 --> 31:27.216
(chokes)

31:29.158 --> 31:30.219
(sputters)

31:30.219 --> 31:32.291
WHAT THE HELL?

31:32.291 --> 31:33.892
I COULDN'T BREATHE!

31:33.892 --> 31:36.525
I-I'M SORRY. I PANICKED,
AND I MEAN,

31:36.525 --> 31:39.228
N-NOT ALL OF US ARE DOCTORS.

31:39.228 --> 31:41.470
(exhales deeply)

31:41.470 --> 31:45.104
(inhales deeply)
I THINK I'LL GO.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.175
(coughs)

31:46.175 --> 31:48.137
(door opens)

31:48.137 --> 31:49.578
(door closes)

32:07.096 --> 32:08.227
HEY, MURPHY.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.298
YEAH?

32:09.298 --> 32:11.160
YOU BETTER TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS.

32:15.264 --> 32:17.306
SOME CRAZY STUFF
IN THERE, HUH?

32:17.306 --> 32:18.637
YEAH.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.971
ANY CHANCE THIS COULD BE
ON THE LEVEL?

32:21.971 --> 32:23.312
BREE VAN DE KAMP.

32:23.312 --> 32:26.575
I KNOW HER. SHE'S THE ONE
WHO RIPPED CHUCK'S HEART OUT.

32:29.178 --> 32:31.250
I GOT A FEELING ABOUT THIS.

32:31.250 --> 32:35.654
ENOUGH OF A FEELING TO GO
DIG UP A CONSTRUCTION SITE?

32:37.426 --> 32:38.657
YEAH.

32:43.993 --> 32:46.165
ARE YOU SURE YOU LOOKED
UNDER YOUR BED?

32:46.165 --> 32:48.467
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.
RUFUS IS LOST.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.099
OKAY. HONEY, MOMMY CAN'T
HELP YOU RIGHT NOW.

32:50.099 --> 32:51.470
GO LOOK IN THE BACKYARD.

32:51.470 --> 32:55.044
SO JUST YOU, OR DID YOU
ADOPT A BUNCH OF ORPHANS

32:55.044 --> 32:56.505
ON YOUR WAY HOME?

33:01.410 --> 33:04.113
COME ON, CARLOS.
TALK TO ME.

33:04.113 --> 33:05.414
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT
TODAY?

33:05.414 --> 33:08.057
(exhales deeply)
DO YOU REMEMBER BILL,

33:08.057 --> 33:10.059
THAT GUY FROM REHAB
I WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT?

33:10.059 --> 33:13.162
OH, YEAH, BILL.

33:13.162 --> 33:15.394
HE WAS MY COUNSELOR?

33:15.394 --> 33:17.566
OH. YEAH. BILL.

33:17.566 --> 33:21.700
(sighs) HE TOLD ME THIS STORY
ABOUT HIS DAD.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.572
HE WAS A PILOT IN VIETNAM,

33:23.572 --> 33:26.105
AND HE'D BE FLYING HIS PLANE,

33:26.105 --> 33:29.338
3,000 FEET UP, DROP HIS BOMBS,
GO BACK TO BASE.

33:29.338 --> 33:32.381
IT WASN'T UNTIL SOMEONE SENT HIM
A "LIFE" MAGAZINE

33:32.381 --> 33:35.784
THAT HE SAW THE RESULTS
OF HIS...

33:35.784 --> 33:37.116
MISSIONS.

33:38.687 --> 33:40.249
IT RUINED HIM.

33:40.249 --> 33:41.620
WHAT, HE DIDN'T KNOW?

33:41.620 --> 33:44.123
HE WAS DROPPING BOMBS.
THINGS WERE GOING "BOOM."

33:44.123 --> 33:45.524
IT WAS THE DISTANCE.

33:45.524 --> 33:49.698
AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
DOING ALL THESE YEARS--

33:49.698 --> 33:52.101
DROPPING BOMBS
FROM THAT SKYSCRAPER,

33:52.101 --> 33:54.463
AND I CAN'T KEEP DOING IT.

33:54.463 --> 34:00.809
I CAN'T KEEP DESTROYING LIVES
FOR SOME...

34:00.809 --> 34:02.571
BOTTOM LINE.

34:07.076 --> 34:10.719
(singsongy)
RUFUS! HERE, KITTY, KITTY!

34:10.719 --> 34:17.556
(meowing)

34:17.556 --> 34:20.188
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
YOU'RE GONNA QUIT YOUR JOB?

34:20.188 --> 34:21.230
YES.

34:21.230 --> 34:23.192
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.

34:23.192 --> 34:25.134
BUT NOT UNTIL I FIND
A NEW ONE.

34:25.134 --> 34:26.165
AND WHAT WILL THAT BE?

34:26.165 --> 34:29.668
(exhales deeply)
WELL, I WAS THINKING...

34:29.668 --> 34:30.699
MAYBE COUNSELING.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.302
IN ONE WEEK,
BILL DOES MORE GOOD

34:33.302 --> 34:35.174
THAN I'VE DONE
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.405
YEAH, AND IN ONE WEEK,
YOU MAKE MORE MONEY

34:36.405 --> 34:38.306
THAN BILL WILL MAKE
IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

34:38.306 --> 34:41.280
I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE
WOULDN'T HAVE TO CUT BACK.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.212
YOU KNOW, WE MAY HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE DOWNSIZING.

34:43.212 --> 34:47.255
WHOA! WHOA! LIKE WHAT?
I NEED SPECIFICS, GANDHI.

34:47.255 --> 34:48.387
I DON'T KNOW!

34:48.387 --> 34:50.319
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE
A BUNCH OF STUFF

34:50.319 --> 34:54.263
THAT WE DON'T NEED--
BIG-SCREEN TVs, TWO CARS,

34:54.263 --> 34:55.424
A REALLY BIG HOUSE.

34:55.424 --> 34:57.166
WELL, YOU WANT US TO MOVE?

34:57.166 --> 35:00.169
YEAH! MAYBE TO SOMEPLACE
WITH A GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL.

35:00.169 --> 35:02.571
UH, NOT YOU'RE YANKING THE KIDS
OUT OF PRIVATE SCHOOL,

35:02.571 --> 35:05.274
WHICH THEY LOVE?
THAT'S YOUR SOLUTION?

35:05.274 --> 35:07.836
(Juanita in distance)
HELP! HELP!

35:07.836 --> 35:09.308
JUANITA?

35:12.281 --> 35:13.642
JUANITA?

35:13.642 --> 35:15.344
(Juanita) MOMMY!

35:18.617 --> 35:19.788
OH, MY GOD!

35:19.788 --> 35:23.352
OKAY. BABY, DON'T MOVE!

35:23.352 --> 35:27.326
I'M SCARED!
 IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE!
DADDY'S COMING. JUST HOLD ON.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.528
AAH!

35:29.528 --> 35:31.260
AND DON'T LOOK DOWN.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.135
OKAY, BABY,

35:37.135 --> 35:39.468
YOU THINK YOU CAN WALK SLOWLY
OVER TO DADDY?

35:39.468 --> 35:41.770
NO. I-I CAN'T MOVE.

35:41.770 --> 35:43.542
OKAY, THEN I'M COMING OUT
TO GET YOU.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.374
NO, WAIT, CARLOS!
BE CAREFUL!

35:51.320 --> 35:53.222
WE ARE GONNA TAKE THIS...

35:53.222 --> 35:55.184
NICE AND SLOW.

35:56.385 --> 35:58.156
OKAY, JUST KEEP YOUR EYES
ON ME.

36:10.339 --> 36:12.601
AAH! OH, MY GOD!

36:12.601 --> 36:14.573
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
I GOT YOU. I GOT YOU.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.414
(breathing heavily)

36:25.414 --> 36:27.316
OHH!

36:27.316 --> 36:28.657
(breathing heavily)

36:33.462 --> 36:35.394
JUANITA'S FINALLY ASLEEP.

36:35.394 --> 36:38.196
SHE OKAY?

36:38.196 --> 36:40.629
(sighs)
YEAH, THANKS TO YOU.

36:40.629 --> 36:43.772
GOD, THAT WAS SO SCARY.

36:43.772 --> 36:45.404
YOU KNOW, IF ANYTHING
HAD HAPPENED TO HER--

36:45.404 --> 36:47.476
IT REALLY PUTS THINGS
INTO PERSPECTIVE, DOESN'T IT?

36:48.777 --> 36:51.540
SURE DOES.

36:51.540 --> 36:52.441
REMINDS YOU
NOTHING'S MORE IMPORTANT

36:52.441 --> 36:55.544
THAN TAKING CARE
OF FAMILY.

36:55.544 --> 36:58.547
I COULD NOT AGREE MORE.

36:58.547 --> 37:00.489
GOOD.

37:00.489 --> 37:02.251
(sighs) SO DOES THIS MEAN
YOU'RE GIVING UP

37:02.251 --> 37:05.694
ALL THAT CRAZY TALK
AND GOING BACK TO WORK?

37:05.694 --> 37:07.926
NO!

37:09.528 --> 37:11.400
THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

37:11.400 --> 37:15.233
IT MEANS I'M MORE AWARE THAN
EVER OF WHAT REALLY MATTERS--

37:15.233 --> 37:16.435
GIVING BACK.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.307
WHY DO YOU KEEP
CALLING IT THAT?

37:18.307 --> 37:21.370
YOU'RE NOT GIVING. YOU'RE
TAKING--FROM US, YOUR FAMILY.

37:21.370 --> 37:23.342
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I THOUGHT YOU'D UNDERSTAND THIS.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.743
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SELFISH.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.715
GUILTY! I AM SELFISH.

37:26.715 --> 37:28.277
BUT YOU KNEW THAT
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED.

37:28.277 --> 37:29.448
THAT WAS THE DEAL--

37:29.448 --> 37:30.679
YOU MAKE THE MONEY,
I SPEND IT.

37:30.679 --> 37:32.020
AND I'M STILL HOLDING UP
MY END.

37:32.020 --> 37:36.685
GABY, I AM MISERABLE AT WORK.
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

37:36.685 --> 37:38.457
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

37:38.457 --> 37:40.429
"I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE"?

37:40.429 --> 37:43.292
WHEN YOU WERE DROWNING
YOUR GUILT IN BOOZE,

37:43.292 --> 37:44.893
WHEN YOU DISAPPEARED
IN REHAB,

37:44.893 --> 37:47.296
BUT I WILLED MYSELF
TO HOLD THIS FAMILY TOGETHER

37:47.296 --> 37:48.737
BECAUSE SOMEONE HAD TO!

37:48.737 --> 37:50.639
AND GUESS WHAT?!

37:50.639 --> 37:53.041
NOW IT IS YOUR TURN.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.490
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

38:11.490 --> 38:15.724
OH. YOU'RE STILL MAD,
AREN'T YOU?

38:15.724 --> 38:17.366
NO.

38:17.366 --> 38:21.069
YOU'RE A HARD GUY
TO STAY MAD AT, MIKE DELFINO.

38:21.069 --> 38:24.533
AND I THINK
I FIGURED OUT WHY.

38:24.533 --> 38:29.778
I FIGURED OUT WHAT IT WAS
ABOUT YOU

38:29.778 --> 38:33.512
THAT FLIPPED MY SWITCH
THE VERY FIRST TIME I MET YOU.

38:33.512 --> 38:36.615
GOTTA BE
THE RUGGED GOOD LOOKS.

38:36.615 --> 38:40.789
(chuckles) NO.
BUT THEY DIDN'T HURT.

38:42.991 --> 38:45.794
OKAY. SO WHAT WAS IT?

38:48.627 --> 38:50.429
YOU DON'T GET SCARED.

38:50.429 --> 38:51.560
ME?

38:51.560 --> 38:52.531
NAH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.604
NO, IT IS.
YOU DON'T GET SCARED.

38:55.604 --> 39:00.409
IT'S WHAT EVERYONE THINKS
WHEN THEY MEET YOU.

39:00.409 --> 39:04.373
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS
TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.477
WHY ARE YOU LIKE THAT?

39:08.477 --> 39:11.119
HMM.

39:13.051 --> 39:17.656
UH, MY, UM...

39:17.656 --> 39:22.060
MY DAD BEAT THE CRAP
OUT OF MY MOM

39:22.060 --> 39:23.462
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

39:24.663 --> 39:27.736
BAD.

39:27.736 --> 39:32.370
I'D HEAR IT HAPPENING.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.602
AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING

39:33.602 --> 39:36.104
A 10-YEAR-OLD KID
COULD DO ABOUT IT.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.682
SO...

39:43.682 --> 39:47.055
MAYBE THIS CAME FROM THAT,
AND, UH...

39:47.055 --> 39:51.960
BUT... MY WHOLE LIFE...

39:51.960 --> 39:55.464
WHEN I SEE SOMEBODY
IN TROUBLE,

39:55.464 --> 39:57.696
I CAN'T WALK AWAY.

40:01.830 --> 40:05.403
BUT I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING
I AM SCARED OF.

40:05.403 --> 40:10.609
I GET SCARED
THAT MAYBE SOMEHOW...

40:10.609 --> 40:14.543
BECAUSE I'M NOT THE MOST
EXPRESSIVE GUY IN THE WORLD...

40:16.144 --> 40:20.749
MAYBE I NEVER MADE IT CLEAR
TO YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.

40:23.191 --> 40:25.153
NO.

40:25.153 --> 40:27.425
NO, I GOT THAT.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.658
(chuckles) MMM.

40:29.658 --> 40:32.961
MMM.

40:34.703 --> 40:36.935
(sighs)

40:36.935 --> 40:38.667
I SHOULD START DINNER.

40:38.667 --> 40:42.010
MM.

40:42.010 --> 40:46.945
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA FIX THAT FENCE POST.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.718
(sighs) TOMORROW.

40:49.718 --> 40:52.821
OHH, TOMORROW.

40:54.823 --> 40:55.884
HEY.

40:57.786 --> 40:59.127
ONE MORE THING.

40:59.127 --> 41:00.689
DELFINO!

41:09.938 --> 41:13.972
WE ALL TAKE THE GIFT OF LIFE
FOR GRANTED.

41:13.972 --> 41:17.846
IF ONLY WE COULD SLOW
THINGS DOWN.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.579
I'M MIKE DELFINO.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.681
I JUST STARTED RENTING
THE SIMMS' HOUSE NEXT DOOR.

41:22.681 --> 41:25.483
SUSAN MAYER.
I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.787
WHATCHA DOIN'?
 LOCKED MYSELF OUT, NAKED.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.689
SO HOW ARE YOU?

41:30.689 --> 41:32.821
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

41:35.524 --> 41:36.865
HE SAID I'M PREGNANT.

41:36.865 --> 41:38.827
(laughs)

41:38.827 --> 41:40.799
(both laughing)

41:43.932 --> 41:45.003
MIKE?

41:45.003 --> 41:57.115
♪♪♪

41:57.115 --> 41:59.918
(gunshot)

41:59.918 --> 42:01.990
BECAUSE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT...

42:01.990 --> 42:03.592
(tires peal)

42:03.592 --> 42:05.023
(car departs rapidly)

42:05.023 --> 42:06.194
(gasps)

42:06.194 --> 42:08.727
THE GIFT IS GONE.

42:08.727 --> 42:11.730
MIKE. MIKE? OH, GOD.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.902
MIKE! NO.

42:13.902 --> 42:18.536
NO. MIKE. NO. (cries)

42:18.536 --> 42:20.939
NO! (wails)

42:20.939 --> 42:23.572
MIKE!

42:23.572 --> 42:25.043
(sobbing)

42:25.043 --> 42:29.778
(wails) NO!
