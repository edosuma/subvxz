00:06.195 --> 00:09.430
If there was ever a place that there
would be paranormal activity,

00:09.431 --> 00:11.932
it would be Fox Hollow Farm.

00:11.933 --> 00:14.034
[Resounding boom]

00:14.035 --> 00:18.010
If investigators are right, Herbert
Baumeister, a Hamilton County businessman,

00:18.011 --> 00:19.873
was a serial killer.

00:19.874 --> 00:21.809
I am the biggest skeptic.

00:21.810 --> 00:22.810
[Camera clicks]

00:22.811 --> 00:23.777
[Electricity crackling]

00:23.778 --> 00:24.516
[Yelps]

00:24.517 --> 00:26.914
But it felt like someone was there.

00:26.915 --> 00:28.506
I saw someone.

00:28.507 --> 00:30.441
There's stuff going on
that I can't explain.

00:30.442 --> 00:32.162
[Doorknob rattling]

00:32.164 --> 00:34.684
Who is there?

00:34.710 --> 00:37.026
[Wood splintering]

00:37.027 --> 00:39.376
I had the sensation to run.

00:39.377 --> 00:40.496
[Dog barking]

00:40.497 --> 00:41.497
I was running for my life.

00:41.498 --> 00:43.385
[Blade scraping]

00:43.386 --> 00:45.441
True fear.

00:45.442 --> 00:46.375
True panic.

00:46.376 --> 00:47.261
[Wails]

00:47.262 --> 00:50.246
I was scared to death.

00:50.247 --> 00:52.407
[Screams]

00:58.118 --> 01:00.818
[Eerie whooshing]

01:03.634 --> 01:06.274
[Birds chirping]

01:06.637 --> 01:09.637
[Wind chimes ringing]

01:09.640 --> 01:12.241
[Haunting music]

01:12.242 --> 01:14.222
44212.

01:14.979 --> 01:17.979
[Murmurs indistinctly]

01:18.135 --> 01:19.302
Getting close.

01:19.303 --> 01:20.570
[Blinker ticking]

01:20.571 --> 01:22.238
Oh, yes. There's the sign.

01:22.239 --> 01:24.130
- Yeah. Oh, good, good, good.
- Okay, we're here.

01:24.131 --> 01:27.844
In 2006, we decided we needed more space.

01:27.845 --> 01:29.613
Hi, there, are you here
for Fox Hollow Farm?

01:29.614 --> 01:30.944
Ah, yeah. Rob Graves.

01:30.945 --> 01:32.279
Everyone loves a good deal.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.365
And on outwards appearance,
it was a great deal...

01:35.366 --> 01:38.110
And it was a steal, actually.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.016 --> 01:55.899
I really wanted a change from city life
and from having neighbors close by...

01:55.900 --> 01:58.296
Somewhere we could just be ourselves.

01:58.297 --> 02:02.066
My goodness. Is that the house?

02:02.067 --> 02:06.070
The first time that we saw the
house, it was very impressive.

02:06.071 --> 02:10.693
Just the way that the property is laid
out and the architecture of the home,

02:10.693 --> 02:14.294
it's just... it's beautiful.

02:20.753 --> 02:23.707
And here we have an 800-square-foot room.

02:23.708 --> 02:27.759
Great place for entertaining your guests.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.093
Wow.

02:29.094 --> 02:31.748
It was breathtaking.

02:31.749 --> 02:35.317
You walk into the home, you walk
into the living room, and...

02:35.318 --> 02:36.972
You want to stay.

02:36.973 --> 02:40.104
Another feature that the house
had was a swimming pool.

02:40.105 --> 02:42.974
It's a large swimming pool, 18x36 feet.

02:42.975 --> 02:45.601
I was thinking, wow I can't
believe that you could actually

02:45.602 --> 02:48.140
buy a home that you have a
swimming pool in your basement.

02:48.141 --> 02:49.914
It's like, how cool is that?

02:49.915 --> 02:55.255
So you guys follow me, and
I'll show you the rest.

02:56.722 --> 02:59.557
Fox Hollow Farm is a beautiful house.

02:59.558 --> 03:02.159
It's in a very desirable location.

03:02.160 --> 03:06.631
It's a desirable property,
but no one's living here.

03:06.632 --> 03:10.802
You just start to ask yourself, what...
what's going on?

03:10.803 --> 03:13.983
[Eerie whooshing noises]

03:23.883 --> 03:26.523
[Haunting music]

03:43.468 --> 03:45.508
[Sighs]

03:46.004 --> 03:48.565
It started to dawn on me that...

03:48.566 --> 03:51.602
This might be a property
that I had remembered,

03:51.603 --> 03:56.112
hearing about in the local
news some time ago.

03:56.113 --> 03:58.449
Oh, uh, this place...

03:58.450 --> 04:03.421
So I asked the realtor, is this in fact
the place where Herb Baumeister lived?

04:03.422 --> 04:06.925
He said, yes, that's why
it was such a good deal.

04:06.926 --> 04:09.626
[Electronic beep]

04:10.529 --> 04:14.666
It took years to unravel the mystery,
but investigators say they now know

04:14.667 --> 04:19.226
who killed nine young men, ages 16 to 30.

04:20.105 --> 04:25.209
A small army of investigators blanketed
the normally tranquil Fox Hollow Farm.

04:25.210 --> 04:31.110
After detectives dug up the remains of
seven men buried on the wooded estate.

04:31.316 --> 04:36.020
The feeling of everybody right now is
that one person did all these crimes.

04:36.021 --> 04:37.388
And that person is...

04:37.389 --> 04:40.029
Herb Baumeister.

04:41.860 --> 04:43.427
Want to go out to see the grounds?

04:43.428 --> 04:46.068
Uh, yeah, sure.

04:52.304 --> 04:54.512
This is Herb Baumeister's house.

04:54.513 --> 04:57.609
Vicki and I walked away and just
talked amongst ourselves for a moment.

04:57.610 --> 05:00.511
And I said, could you live here?
Would it bother you?

05:00.512 --> 05:04.832
And initially, she said, I don't know.

05:05.233 --> 05:10.121
See, there's the apartment
above the barn, uh...

05:10.122 --> 05:12.882
It's really big.

05:14.093 --> 05:18.796
I'm a medical laboratory scientist, so I
worked in a hospital all of my career.

05:18.797 --> 05:21.198
[Men speaking indistinctly]

05:21.199 --> 05:25.942
Death and dying is part of living.
It's part of life.

05:25.943 --> 05:30.011
But when you go into a home where you
know people have lost their lives,

05:30.012 --> 05:33.848
you just feel kind of different.

05:33.849 --> 05:36.789
[Door rattling open]

05:38.383 --> 05:40.963
[Wood creaking]

05:41.419 --> 05:44.059
[Wind whistling]

05:44.470 --> 05:45.474
- Honey?
- Oh!

05:45.475 --> 05:50.635
Oh, sorry. Wow.
It's dark in here, huh? Come on.

05:55.666 --> 05:58.770
Rob and I talked about
the impact on our family

05:58.771 --> 06:02.874
from living in a home, you know, that
had once been owned by a serial killer.

06:02.875 --> 06:06.210
A lot of people live in homes
where people have passed away,

06:06.211 --> 06:08.379
and they may not even know
it when they buy the home.

06:08.380 --> 06:13.360
You know, at least we
knew this going into it.

06:19.658 --> 06:21.192
Whoa!

06:21.193 --> 06:22.293
[Laughter]

06:22.294 --> 06:23.661
- All right.
- Ah.

06:23.662 --> 06:25.029
Boys!

06:25.030 --> 06:26.197
Come for dinner!

06:26.198 --> 06:28.238
Coming!

06:28.867 --> 06:31.507
[Swing creaking]

06:36.842 --> 06:40.022
[Water splashing softly]

06:40.641 --> 06:44.148
We have two teenage boys
that love to use the pool.

06:44.149 --> 06:46.458
There was a lot of gravel
that had been tracked in,

06:46.459 --> 06:48.552
and I thought, I really
need to vacuum this.

06:48.553 --> 06:50.088
[Clicking]

06:50.089 --> 06:52.789
[Vacuum whirring]

06:55.260 --> 06:57.461
I'm starting to suck up some gravel.

06:57.462 --> 07:00.582
[Whirring slows, stops]

07:02.467 --> 07:05.103
All of a sudden, the vacuum turns off.

07:05.104 --> 07:06.804
It's like, oh, great. I pulled it.

07:06.805 --> 07:12.145
You know, I've unplugged it
from the extension cord.

07:12.410 --> 07:14.082
So I plug it back in.

07:14.083 --> 07:17.383
[Click] [Whirring resumes]

07:24.593 --> 07:27.713
[Whirring slows, stops]

07:28.493 --> 07:32.261
And the vacuum turns off again.

07:32.262 --> 07:35.502
So I stand up. I look.

07:36.697 --> 07:40.604
And this time, the cord's pulled apart,
and it's about 12 inches apart,

07:40.605 --> 07:44.325
and they're just laying there.

07:46.111 --> 07:49.160
And I'm thinking to myself,
this is really odd.

07:49.161 --> 07:53.901
Because I know that I didn't pull it apart.

07:58.290 --> 08:01.590
[Click] [Whirring resumes]

08:18.080 --> 08:19.419
[Loud popping]

08:19.420 --> 08:21.220
Oh!

08:21.383 --> 08:23.751
It... it just kind of... it startled me.

08:23.752 --> 08:25.486
[Exhales]

08:25.487 --> 08:30.587
The hairs on the back of
my neck just stood up.

08:31.226 --> 08:33.645
It was definitely a...

08:33.647 --> 08:36.947
Unsettling presence there.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.700
It felt like someone was there.

08:40.701 --> 08:45.681
And it felt like someone
didn't want me there.

08:49.544 --> 08:53.414
I work at a car dealership, and Joe
had just come to work with us.

08:53.415 --> 08:56.475
[Delicate piano music]

08:56.752 --> 08:58.910
I met Rob at the car
dealership where we work,

08:58.911 --> 09:02.690
and he and I were pretty good buddies.

09:02.691 --> 09:04.458
He was chronically late.

09:04.459 --> 09:07.495
He couldn't get to work
on time, and I said, why?

09:07.496 --> 09:08.896
Sorry. [Chuckles]

09:08.897 --> 09:10.031
What's the problem?

09:10.032 --> 09:11.565
[Sighs] Traffic's just insane.

09:11.566 --> 09:14.555
It was taking me a long time to get
to my new job from where I lived.

09:14.556 --> 09:16.115
It was 55 minutes away.

09:16.116 --> 09:19.040
So I decided to find a new apartment
on the north side of town.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.341
You know, Vicki and I have a...

09:20.342 --> 09:23.210
I offered a solution to his commute.

09:23.211 --> 09:27.015
I said that we have an apartment
at the house that no one's using.

09:27.016 --> 09:28.549
So why don't you come check it out?

09:28.550 --> 09:30.251
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

09:30.252 --> 09:32.983
Rob told me about...
briefly about the history.

09:32.984 --> 09:36.223
He didn't hide anything from me, but he
didn't tell me a lot about it either.

09:36.224 --> 09:38.630
But it didn't really affect me much.

09:38.631 --> 09:41.387
All the things that were there at
the time during the murders...

09:41.388 --> 09:43.597
Has all, since then, been gutted.

09:43.598 --> 09:46.878
So, like, all the bad things were all gone.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.699
[Car horn honking]

09:49.805 --> 09:53.447
So the day came when I moved in.

09:53.448 --> 09:57.511
And we're unloading all the trucks into
the apartment, putting boxes down.

09:57.512 --> 09:59.580
That's fine. Wherever.

09:59.581 --> 10:01.190
I thought it was a beautiful place.

10:01.191 --> 10:05.306
And I thought it would be a great
fit for my dog, Fred, and I.

10:05.307 --> 10:07.820
Okay. Oh, man... [fred barks]

10:07.821 --> 10:09.023
Whoa. [Chuckles]

10:09.024 --> 10:10.792
Oh, jeez.

10:10.793 --> 10:13.260
- Are we done?
- We're done, yes.

10:13.261 --> 10:16.497
Once we finally got everything...
last piece moved in, I was just relieved.

10:16.498 --> 10:19.300
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay. Thanks, Rob.

10:19.301 --> 10:21.842
I was very, very tired and uh...

10:21.843 --> 10:24.639
Sat down and just fell asleep.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.580
I was so exhausted.

10:30.879 --> 10:32.134
[Leaves rustling]

10:32.135 --> 10:35.550
I don't remember most of my dreams,
usually, but this one, I did.

10:35.551 --> 10:38.521
[Twigs snapping, leaves rustling]

10:38.522 --> 10:42.062
I had the sensation to run.

10:42.556 --> 10:45.626
I felt like something was chasing me.

10:45.627 --> 10:48.629
I was running from something bad.

10:48.630 --> 10:52.110
I was running for my life.

11:12.687 --> 11:14.547
Run!

11:14.890 --> 11:16.597
I got up to run... [grunts]

11:16.598 --> 11:19.861
And smashed into the door frame.

11:19.862 --> 11:22.502
[Glass shatters]

11:22.530 --> 11:24.986
I just fell to my face.

11:24.987 --> 11:27.434
And I just laid there in so much pain.

11:27.435 --> 11:29.535
[Grunts]

11:31.874 --> 11:36.778
There were shards of glass everywhere,
and I got it into my fingers.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.939
[Wincing]

11:43.051 --> 11:45.391
[Fluttering]

11:49.624 --> 11:51.893
I don't know what I was running from,

11:51.894 --> 11:57.534
but I had the sensation to
get out of there right away.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.793
[Wind chimes ringing] Rob?

12:08.794 --> 12:10.979
Rob, I'm home.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.980
[Wind chimes ringing]

12:17.199 --> 12:19.059
Rob?

12:26.454 --> 12:27.809
Oh!

12:27.810 --> 12:29.993
- Hey.
- You scared the daylights out of me.

12:29.994 --> 12:34.592
I was on the ladder, painting, and
Vicki came home from work, and uh...

12:34.593 --> 12:38.515
I think she was impressed by the
amount of painting I had gotten done.

12:38.516 --> 12:41.194
I was looking at the work
that he had done and...

12:41.195 --> 12:44.375
[Eerie whooshing noises]

12:44.608 --> 12:48.448
Something sort of caught my eye.

12:56.322 --> 12:59.750
I saw someone standing there.

12:59.751 --> 13:02.088
I realized that this guy's
got a red T-shirt on,

13:02.089 --> 13:07.009
and I thought, well, it
could be a trespasser.

13:07.625 --> 13:13.205
He had his back to me, and
he was slowly walking away.

13:14.831 --> 13:17.795
And then I realized...

13:17.796 --> 13:21.156
I couldn't see his legs.

13:25.483 --> 13:29.085
And then suddenly, he just
disappeared into the tree.

13:29.086 --> 13:32.727
My heart just started beating really
hard, because I'm thinking...

13:32.728 --> 13:34.413
Oh, my gosh.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.984
This person just disappeared...

13:36.985 --> 13:40.465
Right in front of my eyes.

13:40.726 --> 13:42.442
Vicki?

13:42.443 --> 13:44.282
What's wrong?

13:44.283 --> 13:46.863
I saw someone.

13:46.936 --> 13:50.248
My first thought was, it's one
of these serial killer groupies.

13:50.249 --> 13:51.879
[Leaves rustling]

13:51.880 --> 13:54.791
Unfortunately, it's a hazard
of living in a house where...

13:54.792 --> 13:58.632
You know, a serial killer lived.

13:59.196 --> 14:01.764
We went over to the spot
right where he disappeared,

14:01.765 --> 14:06.629
and, you know, I was looking
over Rob's shoulders.

14:06.630 --> 14:10.931
There's nothing there, absolutely nothing.

14:10.932 --> 14:14.892
Whoever it was, honey, he's gone.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.957
This is all very unfamiliar territory.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.518
I am the biggest skeptic, you know?

14:21.519 --> 14:24.920
I am a scientist.
You have to prove things to me.

14:24.921 --> 14:28.458
But I guarantee you, I saw what I saw.

14:28.459 --> 14:31.279
[Crickets chirping]

14:33.330 --> 14:34.697
[Fred panting]

14:34.698 --> 14:37.099
[Indistinct chatter on TV]

14:37.100 --> 14:39.769
I'd been living there for about a week.

14:39.770 --> 14:42.337
It was probably about 8:45, 9:00 at night.

14:42.338 --> 14:44.440
And I was washing a couple dishes.

14:44.441 --> 14:46.197
[Over television] Hey,
nobody ever asked you...

14:46.198 --> 14:47.681
[Knocking]

14:47.682 --> 14:49.379
All of a sudden, I heard
a knock on the door.

14:49.380 --> 14:51.454
Just a minute.

14:51.455 --> 14:54.817
I grabbed a towel. I still had my
hands wet, and I dried off my hands.

14:54.818 --> 14:56.771
[Knocking]

14:56.772 --> 14:58.574
And meanwhile, the door is still knocking.

14:58.575 --> 15:00.183
Be right there.

15:00.184 --> 15:01.284
[Knocking]

15:01.285 --> 15:03.048
[Fred barks and growls]

15:03.049 --> 15:05.579
Just a minute.

15:05.580 --> 15:08.100
Take it easy.

15:10.167 --> 15:14.187
I opened the door, opened it wide.

15:16.239 --> 15:18.605
There was no one there.

15:18.606 --> 15:20.586
Hello?

15:21.160 --> 15:23.633
I looked out, did not see anyone
at the bottom of the staircase.

15:23.634 --> 15:27.928
I looked over the balcony,
didn't see anyone there.

15:27.929 --> 15:30.353
Didn't know who would
have knocked on the door.

15:30.354 --> 15:32.934
[Lock clicking]

15:35.559 --> 15:38.528
I kind of paused to gather myself.

15:38.529 --> 15:42.094
I actually didn't feel too comfortable.

15:42.095 --> 15:47.495
And I just felt like there
was something watching me.

15:47.604 --> 15:51.204
But I couldn't see anything.

15:53.644 --> 15:57.124

[Fred barks and growls]

16:12.663 --> 16:15.123
[Fred snarls]

16:15.432 --> 16:20.352
Then all of a sudden,
something caught my eye.

16:20.371 --> 16:24.691
It was like a light wisp of something.

16:27.911 --> 16:30.551
[Dramatic music]

16:34.351 --> 16:37.052
So I looked back into the bedroom.

16:37.053 --> 16:39.573
[Music swells]

[Music stops]

16:44.661 --> 16:46.471
[Crickets chirping]

16:46.472 --> 16:48.759
I saw nothing.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.460
[Fred whimpering]

16:52.686 --> 16:56.466
Did you see something too, boy?

16:57.207 --> 16:59.967
[Static crackling]

17:02.607 --> 17:04.380
After what Vicki had seen.

17:04.381 --> 17:07.817
I became concerned for everyone's safety.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.986
So we installed a closed-circuit
television system.

17:10.987 --> 17:12.386
[Static crackling]

17:12.387 --> 17:15.991
We put cameras on the barn facing
the house, one on the back side,

17:15.992 --> 17:19.387
one at the front door, and
one at the back door.

17:19.387 --> 17:21.130
The cameras are on all the time.

17:21.131 --> 17:24.300
And we can watch them from
the kitchen on a monitor.

17:24.300 --> 17:27.060
[Static crackling]

17:30.956 --> 17:32.964
Here you go, Freddy.

17:32.965 --> 17:35.245
Let's go.

17:35.295 --> 17:37.129
[Light clicks on]

17:37.130 --> 17:39.775
It was about three weeks after
I had moved into the house,

17:39.776 --> 17:41.757
and what I had been doing
at night, on clear nights,

17:41.758 --> 17:47.658
I would take my dog, Fred, with me
and walk up and down the driveway.

17:48.808 --> 17:51.328
[Branch snaps]

17:53.110 --> 17:55.046
I hear this noise coming from the woods.

17:55.047 --> 17:56.949
[Fred barking]

17:56.950 --> 18:00.658
Fred actually stopped, and
his ears are perked up.

18:00.659 --> 18:01.943
[Branch snaps]

18:01.944 --> 18:05.261
I look down at him, and he's
making quiet growling noises.

18:05.262 --> 18:06.766
[Fred barking and growling]

18:06.767 --> 18:09.097
Fred, come on, buddy.

18:09.098 --> 18:12.698
Let's, uh... let's go back.

18:16.105 --> 18:17.739
[Fred barking]

18:17.740 --> 18:20.575
And then my dog took off running.

18:20.576 --> 18:25.796
So I looked around to see
what he was looking at.

18:26.528 --> 18:29.048
[Fred barking]

18:29.737 --> 18:34.790
I saw this...
this man, this man in a red shirt.

[Fred barking]

18:35.880 --> 18:36.699
Fred!

18:36.700 --> 18:39.515
He's walking into the trees, and
he walked in front of two of them,

18:39.516 --> 18:41.884
and then he just faded
away and disappeared.

18:41.885 --> 18:42.740
[Fred barking]

18:42.741 --> 18:44.661
Fred!

18:44.921 --> 18:47.561
[Gasping softly]

18:52.595 --> 18:55.731
I was fearful to go in the
woods where this man was.

18:55.732 --> 18:58.537
I thought, is he a bad person or...

18:58.538 --> 19:01.409
I didn't know what to think.

19:01.410 --> 19:03.501

shirt for the second time.

19:46.430 --> 19:48.287

[Fred barking]

20:09.385 --> 20:11.665

20:17.560 --> 20:19.728
He... he was kind of standing
right about there, right?

20:19.729 --> 20:21.630
And then he turned, and
he walked into the woods,

20:21.631 --> 20:23.960
kind of, like, striding, like this,
you know, like with a purpose.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.109
- Red T-shirt and...
- Yes.

20:25.110 --> 20:29.040
Everything that Joe described was
exactly the person that I saw.

20:29.041 --> 20:30.605
Right up into these woods,
right about here.

20:30.606 --> 20:34.107
This is where he... this is where he...

20:34.108 --> 20:35.755
Disappeared.

20:35.756 --> 20:41.156
We realized that we had
actually seen the same thing.

20:42.985 --> 20:46.326
There was no evidence that
anyone had been there.

20:46.327 --> 20:48.538
And I'm thinking...

20:48.539 --> 20:51.299
Okay, you know...

20:52.646 --> 20:55.406
What's going on?

I woke up with kind of a startling
feel, and I heard this knocking.

21:45.147 --> 21:47.114
I was calling out, what do you want?

And I wasn't hearing any
sort of response back.

21:50.074 --> 21:51.921

Who is that?

21:56.459 --> 21:58.679

21:58.894 --> 22:01.429
But it just kept going on and on and on.

knock, knock, knock.

You can feel the vibration,
and you can actually

22:15.660 --> 22:17.977
feel the wooden panels
vibrating inside the door.

[Knocking and rattling]

There was no one there.

22:38.946 --> 22:41.038
But the door knocker was still horizontal.

[Panting]

22:45.127 --> 22:46.173
[Bang!]

22:46.174 --> 22:49.790
And then it fell and knocked one last time.

22:49.791 --> 22:52.242
And that just scared the hell out of me.

22:52.243 --> 22:54.703
Who's there?

23:01.582 --> 23:03.323
I looked around.

23:03.324 --> 23:05.007
All the lights were off on the house.

23:05.008 --> 23:09.366
At Rob and Vicki's house,
there was no one awake.

23:09.367 --> 23:11.321
I didn't hear any footsteps
of anyone running away,

23:11.322 --> 23:14.150
which I would have hear because
it was silent that night.

23:14.151 --> 23:17.811
I didn't know what to think.

out beyond the lights,

24:14.530 --> 24:19.930
and I just felt like there
was something watching me.

24:24.239 --> 24:25.940
I shut the door.

24:25.941 --> 24:28.033
I locked the dead bolt.

24:30.449 --> 24:31.883
It's okay. You're okay.

24:31.884 --> 24:33.584
And then the strangest thing happened.

24:33.585 --> 24:37.010
My dog, Fred, he starts growling at me.

24:40.282 --> 24:41.826

like the doorknob turning.

[Squeaking]

24:49.368 --> 24:51.836
As the doorknob started
to turn, you'd hear...

[Squeaking]

24:55.388 --> 24:56.389
[Creaking]

24:56.390 --> 24:59.844

which just made this horrific errr sound.

24:59.845 --> 25:02.665
[Metallic creaking]

25:07.047 --> 25:08.625
And then it...

25:08.626 --> 25:11.506
It stopped turning.

25:14.063 --> 25:17.238
[Bang!] [Wood splintering]

25:17.239 --> 25:18.663
Bang.

25:18.664 --> 25:21.465
The door flew open and
slammed into the wall,

25:21.466 --> 25:26.626
and wood chips went flying
all over the apartment.

25:30.642 --> 25:33.102
Who's there?

25:33.312 --> 25:35.980
[Footsteps pattering]

[Shrieks]

25:42.415 --> 25:44.488
[Fred barking]

25:44.489 --> 25:46.257
He had a complete look
of terror on his face.

25:46.258 --> 25:47.692
[Shrieks]

25:47.693 --> 25:49.666
You could just tell he was
running for his life.

25:49.667 --> 25:51.066
He was breathing heavy.

25:51.067 --> 25:54.933
I mean, he was trying to
get away from somebody.

25:54.934 --> 25:56.666
[Wood creaks]

25:56.667 --> 26:01.527
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

26:06.127 --> 26:08.287
[Shrieks]

26:15.361 --> 26:19.097
I honestly think that I saw one
of Herb Baumeister's victims

26:19.098 --> 26:20.365
running for their lives.

26:20.366 --> 26:23.126
[Wood splintering]

26:24.036 --> 26:26.135
I think I see the victims
because they're...

26:26.136 --> 26:29.037
They're trying to get our attention
to help them find closure.

26:29.038 --> 26:30.740
They're seeking our assistance.

26:30.741 --> 26:33.816
Let's look at this stuff here.
I found all this...

26:33.817 --> 26:36.347
The first person I told was actually Vicki.

26:36.348 --> 26:37.748
Oh, wow.

26:37.749 --> 26:41.377
We started researching
more about the victims...

26:41.378 --> 26:44.834
About everything that was
found on the property.

26:44.835 --> 26:50.735
And we started becoming a lot more
interested in the investigation.

26:52.131 --> 26:54.970
We had called a local news station
to get some of the footage

26:54.971 --> 26:59.860
of the news stories that I didn't
remember even seeing back in 1996.

26:59.861 --> 27:03.163
..Bodies had been in
the woods for 16 months.

27:03.164 --> 27:05.560
The bones discovered in June of 1996.

27:05.561 --> 27:08.413
Contain the DNA identities of 11 victims...

27:08.414 --> 27:11.018
Only 8 are identified.

27:11.019 --> 27:13.271
Investigators say all
the victims were young,

27:13.272 --> 27:15.719
white, and had ties in the gay community.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.689
An informant told Indianapolis
police that Herb Baumeister...

27:18.690 --> 27:21.498
They started showing
photographs of the victims.

27:21.499 --> 27:23.294
Missing person they were looking for...

27:23.295 --> 27:26.998
And then one particular
photograph popped up.

27:26.999 --> 27:29.334
Oh, my God.

27:29.335 --> 27:30.768
[Stammering]

27:30.769 --> 27:32.303
That was the guy. Pause it.

27:32.304 --> 27:33.371
[Grunts] Give me that.

27:33.372 --> 27:34.538
What guy?

27:34.539 --> 27:36.759
That guy.

27:38.113 --> 27:42.013
And then I realized... [shrieking]

27:45.884 --> 27:48.152
That's the young person that
runs through my apartment.

27:48.153 --> 27:50.754
That is the person.
Without a doubt, that is the person.

27:50.755 --> 27:51.990
- Really?
- Yes.

27:51.991 --> 27:53.858
Vicki, that is the guy
I saw in my apartment.

27:53.859 --> 27:55.472
But we have not reached the end of it.

27:55.473 --> 27:57.731
There still might be some
information out there...

27:57.732 --> 28:03.492
Um that might take this
investigation a little bit further.

28:10.597 --> 28:15.139
The police found 5,500 bone
fragments on the property.

28:15.140 --> 28:18.769
We all know that there's more out there.

28:18.770 --> 28:20.769
Fred! Come on, buddy!

28:20.770 --> 28:23.050
Let's go!

28:25.624 --> 28:29.160
Living in a place like that, you're
out in the woods, walking around,

28:29.161 --> 28:35.033
and you're near the areas where
they found a lot of bones.

28:35.034 --> 28:40.934
You can't help but think about
Herb Baumeister and the victims.

28:50.113 --> 28:51.918
I'm not really sure what
made me look to the left,

28:51.919 --> 28:57.819
but I just happened to glance that
direction, and something caught my eye.

29:00.210 --> 29:06.110
It was just laying on the ground
like I was meant to find it.

29:07.699 --> 29:13.459
At that point, I think it
really did start to make sense.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.774
The new Italian Restaurant...
I think we should take the boys.

29:16.775 --> 29:18.108
- Oh, okay.
- You know?

29:18.109 --> 29:18.842
Sure.

29:18.843 --> 29:22.213
It was a Sunday night.
Vicki and I had just come home from dinner.

29:22.214 --> 29:25.583
- You think they'd like Italian, honey?
- Oh, pbbt. I think the boys like to eat.

29:25.584 --> 29:27.308
- They'll eat anything...
- [Gasps]

29:27.309 --> 29:30.455
I found something. I found something.

29:30.456 --> 29:36.356
Joe met us in the driveway, and
he said, "I found something".

29:42.901 --> 29:44.969
Where did you find that?

29:44.970 --> 29:46.765
You could tell it was a human bone.

29:46.766 --> 29:48.630
That's a femur.

29:48.631 --> 29:51.156
- You sure?
- It's definitely human.

29:51.157 --> 29:54.578
I was surprised at how good a
condition the bone was in, and...

29:54.579 --> 29:58.165
And then when Joe told me that he
found it just laying on the ground...

29:58.166 --> 29:59.348
I was amazed.

29:59.349 --> 30:03.221
Just lying there, Rob, like
I was meant to find it.

30:03.222 --> 30:07.988
It was found sort of in the area where
we saw the guy in the red shirt.

30:07.989 --> 30:12.119
And maybe this was what
he was leading us to.

30:12.120 --> 30:17.820
I'll report it to the police
first thing in the morning.

30:19.575 --> 30:22.465
I felt the need to get the
person that was actually there.

30:22.466 --> 30:26.103
So I contacted the lead
Detective on the case.

30:26.104 --> 30:32.004
And he agreed to come out and show us
where things had actually taken place.

30:35.343 --> 30:39.212
The Baumeister investigation was one
of the largest cases we've ever had.

30:39.213 --> 30:41.085
I remember this place.

30:41.086 --> 30:45.826
It was a big part of my life at that time.

30:48.557 --> 30:50.948
I found the place to be
disturbing not only in '96,

30:50.949 --> 30:56.229
but it brought those disturbing
feelings back to me.

30:57.733 --> 30:59.653
Yeah.

30:59.668 --> 31:01.502
In our investigations, we found that...

31:01.503 --> 31:07.041
He told me how Herb Baumeister had selected
his victims from gay bars downtown...

31:07.042 --> 31:12.847
That he would offer to bring them up for
a swim in the indoor swimming pool.

31:12.848 --> 31:18.548
As I was looking around, it
was like I was back in '96.

31:20.121 --> 31:24.863
Mr. Baumeister had mannequins
around the pool in various poses.

31:24.864 --> 31:28.104
[Camera shutter clicking]

31:28.137 --> 31:32.124
It just seemed weird.
It seemed like a setup...

31:32.125 --> 31:35.038
To lure his victims there.

31:35.039 --> 31:38.008
We surmised that Mister Baumeister
had gained control over his victims

31:38.009 --> 31:40.110
by the use of either
alcohol and/or drugs...

31:40.111 --> 31:41.433
[Camera shutter clicking]

31:41.434 --> 31:46.717
Brought them into the pool, asked them
to participate in auto erotic asphyxia.

31:46.718 --> 31:49.720
And then killed these
individuals by strangulation.

31:49.721 --> 31:52.421
[Camera clicking]

31:58.223 --> 32:00.934
His victims probably thought it was cool.

32:00.935 --> 32:02.919
It's kind of like a spa.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.855
In fact, it was a killing ground.
It was a trap.

32:05.856 --> 32:08.556
[Screams echoing]

32:10.594 --> 32:13.715
At the end, when everything
was coming to light.

32:13.716 --> 32:16.499
Mr. Baumeister killed himself...

32:16.500 --> 32:18.645
Uh, with a gunshot wound to the head.

32:18.646 --> 32:20.806
[Gunshot]

32:27.846 --> 32:28.869
[Laughs]

32:28.870 --> 32:31.480
- Oh, my goodness.
- All right.

32:31.481 --> 32:33.014
Incoming!

32:33.015 --> 32:35.689
A friend of mine, Jeremy, came
over, and he's been wanting to see

32:35.690 --> 32:38.354
the house and get a tour of the
house for quite some time.

32:38.355 --> 32:41.595
- Oh, sure.
- Oh, yeah!

32:42.014 --> 32:44.914
This was the first time I had been
to visit Joe at his apartment.

32:44.915 --> 32:47.458
It was about 6:00. It was dark outside.

32:47.459 --> 32:50.654
We're just having fun, you know,
just playing around with the kids.

32:50.655 --> 32:53.769
- Blah!
- Oh! Oh, man! Nice.

32:53.770 --> 32:55.034
That is disgusting.

32:55.035 --> 32:56.809
We were actually picking
up the large beetles,

32:56.810 --> 32:58.263
that were dead in the bottom of the pool.

32:58.264 --> 32:59.732
Okay, here we go. They're down here.

32:59.733 --> 33:04.533
- I'll get 'em for you.
- That's disgusting.

33:07.808 --> 33:10.448
[Haunting music]

33:16.359 --> 33:17.588
[Laughs]

33:17.589 --> 33:19.272
Yes! There you go.

33:19.273 --> 33:22.393
I got one right here.

33:29.903 --> 33:35.183
All of a sudden, I felt
this sensation on my neck.

33:49.175 --> 33:51.978
[Distant screaming]

33:51.979 --> 33:57.379
I first thought...
I thought it was one of the boys.

33:57.885 --> 34:00.105
[Laughter]

34:01.656 --> 34:04.333
But I saw them in the
opposite end of the pool.

34:04.334 --> 34:08.534
And I realized that it was not them.

34:17.839 --> 34:20.539
[Water splashing]

34:22.480 --> 34:25.447
I just felt these... these fingers.

34:25.449 --> 34:29.476
And I felt like I was being choked.

34:29.478 --> 34:31.862
[Gasping and coughing]

34:31.862 --> 34:34.924
I turn and look at him...

34:34.925 --> 34:38.534
And he puts his hands up to his neck.

34:38.536 --> 34:40.303
[Gasping]

34:40.304 --> 34:43.474
Pure panic just comes over his face.

34:43.475 --> 34:46.577
It was not fake.
Joe and I joke around all the time.

34:46.578 --> 34:50.125
He was not joking whatsoever.

34:50.126 --> 34:51.322
Joe, are you okay?

34:51.324 --> 34:54.565
Boys, Jeremy, out. Let's go.
Out. Everybody out. Come on.

34:54.567 --> 34:56.311
- Why?
- We're getting... let's go.

34:56.312 --> 34:58.041
We can't be in there any
more, come on, let's go.

34:58.042 --> 34:59.623
Out. Get out! Go on, guys!

34:59.624 --> 35:01.725
True fear. True panic.

35:01.726 --> 35:04.666
He wanted to leave.

35:12.437 --> 35:14.657
[Coughing]

35:20.412 --> 35:22.413
There's no question of what I felt.

35:22.414 --> 35:25.649
I mean, I was scared to death.

35:25.650 --> 35:27.252
[Knocking]

35:27.253 --> 35:29.085
Joe, you okay in there?

35:29.086 --> 35:30.519
What's going on, man? Are you okay?

35:30.520 --> 35:32.993
I couldn't help but think of
Herb Baumeister and his victims.

35:32.994 --> 35:36.522
And I had kind of a picture
of what the victims...

35:36.523 --> 35:39.467
Were going through their
last final moments in life.

35:39.468 --> 35:42.966
And that was just rather frightening.

35:42.967 --> 35:46.336
[Over television] Are certain the
same man killed all nine victims.

35:46.337 --> 35:48.138
All were discovered in or near...

35:48.139 --> 35:54.039
I was in my apartment over by my
front door where my computer is.

35:54.416 --> 35:56.996
[Wings flutter]

36:07.455 --> 36:10.695
[Scraping and clattering]

36:13.798 --> 36:19.698
All of a sudden, I heard a scraping
sound, a metallic scraping.

36:53.872 --> 36:58.972
And then I noticed something
strange on the wall.

37:04.749 --> 37:09.309
And there was actually these knife marks...

37:09.888 --> 37:14.688
Multiple knife marks
that go across the wall.

37:18.095 --> 37:20.285
And now I'm thinking, you know,
that someone could have been

37:20.286 --> 37:25.986
murdered or stabbed in my
kitchen right next to the sink.

37:26.050 --> 37:31.041
It's actually quite horrifying because
the stuff that's happened in the past...

37:31.042 --> 37:34.444
Potentially, some of it actually
happened in my living quarters.

37:34.445 --> 37:37.414
And there potentially is
still someone in here.

37:37.415 --> 37:40.055
[Dramatic music]

37:41.485 --> 37:43.845
We've all seen all these
ghost hunter shows.

37:43.846 --> 37:46.857
And how they go around investigating
with voice recorders and so forth.

37:46.858 --> 37:50.260
So I had my telephone.
It has a great voice recorder on it.

37:50.261 --> 37:53.223
I turned that on, and I turned off the A.C.

37:53.224 --> 37:55.532
I unplugged the refrigerator, the TV.

37:55.533 --> 38:00.993
Everything that could potentially
make a noise was off.

38:05.643 --> 38:08.645
Is anyone here with me right now?

38:08.646 --> 38:14.546
I felt extremely silly doing this, but I
really wanted to see if anything was there.

38:18.409 --> 38:21.229
[Floorboard creaks]

38:33.871 --> 38:37.540
And when I was standing there in the
kitchen, I asked this question.

38:37.541 --> 38:40.601
Is there anyone here?

38:41.679 --> 38:44.799
[Soft whooshing sounds]

38:44.940 --> 38:48.780
There was absolutely no response.

38:51.656 --> 38:54.176
[Fred barking]

38:55.760 --> 38:58.461
At that point, my dog started
growling in the background.

38:58.462 --> 38:59.997
[Fred barking]

38:59.998 --> 39:03.538
That was a big sign to me.

39:10.197 --> 39:13.954
Is anyone here with us tonight?

39:13.955 --> 39:16.680
Who keeps walking in the kitchen?

39:16.681 --> 39:18.649
[Muffled murmuring]

39:18.650 --> 39:21.118
[Fred barking]

39:21.119 --> 39:24.320
All of a sudden, I heard a sound.

39:24.321 --> 39:26.389
[Recording whirring in reverse]

39:26.390 --> 39:28.524
So I listened to it again...

39:28.525 --> 39:29.529
[Muffled murmuring]

39:29.530 --> 39:30.828
And again... [muffled murmuring]

39:30.829 --> 39:33.305
And again. [Muffled murmuring]

39:33.306 --> 39:35.515
[Muffled murmuring]

39:35.516 --> 39:37.174
[Muffled murmuring]

39:37.175 --> 39:39.067
[Muffled murmuring]

39:39.068 --> 39:40.937
[Muffled murmuring]

39:40.938 --> 39:44.418
[Louder indistinct murmuring]

39:44.608 --> 39:46.877
[Feedback screeches]

39:46.878 --> 39:51.978
And then I hear this voice,
which is so clear...

39:52.917 --> 39:55.737
"The married one."

40:02.630 --> 40:05.450
"The married one."

40:15.977 --> 40:20.477
Without a doubt, this voice was not mine.

40:20.894 --> 40:24.532
I've never heard that voice before. So...

40:24.533 --> 40:27.989
It was no question that something was
trying to let me know that they were there.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.290
The married one.

40:29.291 --> 40:32.171
[Feedback screeches]

40:34.558 --> 40:36.898
..victims have been found.

40:36.899 --> 40:39.861
All the victims were young,
single men with ties...

40:39.862 --> 40:43.873
Single men who were vulnerable
members of society.

40:43.874 --> 40:45.742
[Indistinct speech]

40:45.743 --> 40:51.643
The man responsible is a well respected
husband, father, and businessman.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.556
..Suspected married businessman.

40:54.557 --> 40:56.092
- Suspected married...
- Married.

40:56.093 --> 40:59.813
- Married.
- Herbert Baumeister.

41:03.009 --> 41:07.089
I was convinced that Herb was back.

41:11.076 --> 41:12.436
[Static crackles]

41:12.437 --> 41:13.604
[Electronic beep]

41:13.605 --> 41:16.061
The crime tape came down today.

41:16.062 --> 41:18.657
But investigators wonder
what other secrets,

41:18.658 --> 41:22.912
Herbert Baumeister took
with him to the grave.

41:22.913 --> 41:25.493
[Camera clicks]

41:42.817 --> 41:45.393
Everyone that's owned the
property since has really

41:45.394 --> 41:48.816
tried to distance themselves
from this whole history.

41:48.817 --> 41:51.577
When in fact you'll never get away from it.

41:51.578 --> 41:53.714
It's always going to be that place.

41:53.715 --> 41:56.428
If Herb Baumeister's spirit
came after my boy's...

41:56.429 --> 42:00.023
I would take action right away.
And I would leave.

42:00.024 --> 42:04.582
I'm not going to stay somewhere
and put the family at risk.

42:04.583 --> 42:07.535
I don't think we'll ever get
rid of Herb Baumeister.

42:07.536 --> 42:10.029
He's far too strong of a presence.

42:10.030 --> 42:12.538
But um, if we can keep him
out of the apartment,

42:12.539 --> 42:15.010
and at the house from Rob
and Vicki and the two boys.

42:15.011 --> 42:18.791
I'd feel very good about that.
