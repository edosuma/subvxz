00:12.846 --> 00:14.430
<i>- Previously on "Below Deck"...</i>

00:14.472 --> 00:16.015
- Nice to meet you.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.434
You do realize that, though,
I find you very attractive?

00:18.476 --> 00:20.144
- I think it's wild.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.438
I don't know if it's
just a switch you can just flip.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.481
- You and I both
look out the same windows

00:24.524 --> 00:25.691
and we see the same dirt.

00:25.725 --> 00:27.693
How come nobody's taking care
of it?

00:27.727 --> 00:30.446
I'm willing to go out on a limb
and give him a second shot.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.990
Just to show you
that it's not on the inside.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.324
I want it done.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.201
- Is this our anniversary today?
- Yeah.

00:36.235 --> 00:37.661
Made it to our first week.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.538
This is like awkwardly romantic.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.040
- I know something's wrong.

00:41.074 --> 00:42.791
I know her energy.
I know her so well.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.293
- Well, she likes you, man.

00:44.335 --> 00:45.878
- You know I don't
want anything to change.

00:45.912 --> 00:47.337
We work really well.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.964
- It's a bit of
a smack in the face

00:49.007 --> 00:50.382
to know that you've
just been "friend-zoned."

00:50.416 --> 00:52.217
- Would I be wasting time
with Emily?

00:52.251 --> 00:54.178
<i>- I mean, I would give it a go.</i>

00:55.755 --> 00:57.222
- I'm gonna sweep her
off her feet

00:57.256 --> 00:58.348
and she's not gonna know
what f---ing hit her.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.060
- Surprise!
- Oh, my God.

01:02.929 --> 01:05.022
- Oh, my God, Ben is, like,
hating his life right now.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.565
- It's great.

01:06.599 --> 01:07.733
It's awesome.

01:07.767 --> 01:09.985
I need to cool off.

01:14.240 --> 01:21.205

01:29.122 --> 01:34.259
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

01:36.629 --> 01:38.597
- You are burnt
on your back there.

01:38.631 --> 01:40.265
- Am I?
- Yeah.

01:40.299 --> 01:41.934
- Is that sunscreen?
Oh, thank you.

01:44.470 --> 01:45.604
Is it bad?

01:45.638 --> 01:47.189
- Little bit.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.649
- Pick it up, center-fielder.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.115
<i> - Hi.</i>

01:58.618 --> 02:01.411
- Has anybody caught your eye or
have you got someone back home?

02:01.454 --> 02:02.454
- Mm, I don't have anyone.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.458
<i> I don't really know</i>
<i> how to deal with this one.</i>

02:06.492 --> 02:08.585
It's taking me by surprise.

02:11.664 --> 02:13.132
- Where have you guys been?

02:17.303 --> 02:18.554
- What do you want
to drink, babe?

02:18.596 --> 02:19.596
- I don't know.
What do you want?

02:19.639 --> 02:21.140
- You all right, bro?

02:21.174 --> 02:23.600
- Yeah, I've got to, um...

02:24.644 --> 02:26.311
- Okay.

02:26.345 --> 02:28.313
- Some of the relationships
I've had in my past,

02:28.347 --> 02:31.441
I knew that I wouldn't
end up with that person.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.653
<i> And the older you get,</i>
<i> time is of the essence.</i>

02:34.687 --> 02:38.407
So I should probably take it
a little bit more seriously

02:38.449 --> 02:39.950
and actually meet someone

02:39.993 --> 02:41.451
<i> that I can see myself with.</i>

02:46.532 --> 02:50.252
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

02:50.295 --> 02:51.670
- Oh, yeah?

02:51.704 --> 02:52.671
- Oh, yes.

02:52.705 --> 02:54.590
- Glad you're here.

02:54.632 --> 02:57.176
- Look, I can make
a pussy and a heart together.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.636
- Shh.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.471
- Absence makes
the heart grow fonder,

03:01.514 --> 03:02.764
or it doesn't.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.516
- Oh, baby girl.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.185
- And for us, it has.

03:17.563 --> 03:18.947
Romance is definitely
in the air.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.699
You know, Kate's got Ro.

03:20.733 --> 03:23.493
<i> Kyle's just having a field day</i>
<i> with Sierra.</i>

03:23.536 --> 03:26.163
And, you know, here I am
with my good friend Nico.

03:35.748 --> 03:37.549
- Why?

03:37.583 --> 03:41.136
- He's lovely, but I'm not
attracted to him in that way.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.388
- I think she thinks
I'm a muscle-head.

03:43.422 --> 03:44.890
- Yeah, but she's
definitely interested.

03:44.924 --> 03:47.351
- He's obviously absolutely
gorgeous and--

03:47.393 --> 03:48.727
- He is!
He's like a freaking superhuman.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.687
- But he is not my type.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.691
- She's from the south, mate.
- Oh.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.568
- She's a Londoner.
- Oh, a Londoner.

03:56.602 --> 04:00.030
- And she's from Northwest
London; she's very f---ing posh.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.365
- Hello.

04:04.535 --> 04:05.494
- What are you thinking about,
about...

04:11.376 --> 04:14.044
No, it's great.
It's a beautiful thing.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.087
I love it.
- Well...

04:20.093 --> 04:23.303
- See, I think it's the biggest
compliment in the world.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.100
- Well, maybe, you know, if
we're not meant to be together,

04:28.134 --> 04:29.184
she's done with men.

04:35.566 --> 04:36.525
- All right.
Y'all ready?

04:36.567 --> 04:37.901
- Let's do it.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.904

04:40.947 --> 04:42.114

Thank you.

04:43.649 --> 04:47.327

04:53.584 --> 04:54.960

04:56.996 --> 04:58.755
You know, sell me a ticket.

05:03.002 --> 05:04.428
- And we live on it, guys.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.434
<i> - Things with Ro</i>

05:10.476 --> 05:12.394
I think anybody who's ever

05:12.437 --> 05:14.646
<i> fallen in love knows</i>
<i> that the first three months</i>

05:14.680 --> 05:16.773

- Okay.
- And I'll do the gunk--

05:32.865 --> 05:34.124
junk stuff.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.626
- We should get one of these.

05:36.669 --> 05:37.753
- I don't want it.

05:37.795 --> 05:38.795
- But why?

05:42.300 --> 05:43.842
<i> - Kelley, Kelley; Lee.</i>

05:43.876 --> 05:45.427
<i> Can I get you</i>
<i> up at the bridge, please?</i>

05:45.470 --> 05:47.763
- Yes, sir.
Heading your way now.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.806
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

05:49.849 --> 05:51.433
- Just wanted to

05:51.476 --> 05:53.685
go over a couple of things
with you.

05:53.719 --> 05:57.439
Try to keep in your mind to--to
be a little bit more proactive.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.857
'Cause your crew's gonna
follow your lead.

05:58.891 --> 05:59.858
- Yeah.

05:59.892 --> 06:00.859
- So if you're just

06:00.893 --> 06:02.152
sitting down in the crew mess,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.029
waiting for me
to tell you what to do,

06:04.063 --> 06:06.198
they're gonna sit down in
the crew mess waiting for you

06:06.232 --> 06:08.200
to tell them what I tell you.
- Yeah.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.452
- Go to the charter guests
after they get settled in

06:10.495 --> 06:11.870
and find out what
they want to do.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.622
It's a good skill to develop.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.499
- No, that's fine.
Yeah, I can definitely do that.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.959
- I don't get overly impressed
with somebody just doing

06:18.002 --> 06:19.378
what they're supposed to do.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.213
I get impressed with somebody
going beyond

06:21.247 --> 06:22.506
what they're supposed to do.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.800
Just a little bit
more proactive.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.009
- Can do.
- Thanks, Kelley.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.302
- No problem, Captain.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.680
Oh, f--- me.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.059
- Did you see Ro today?

06:34.093 --> 06:36.186
- Yes.
They both slept on the boat.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.397
- In a cabin, yeah?
- Yeah, I guess a cabin.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.148
- They're a noisy couple.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.234
- Nice.
I'm sure you like to hear that.

06:42.268 --> 06:43.652
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, I would love it.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.153
- Hello.
- Ro's leaving.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.530
- Aw.
- Buh-bye.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.491
- Good to meet you.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.410
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, love.

06:51.444 --> 06:52.869
- It was great to meet you.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.413
- Very nice to meet you.

06:54.447 --> 06:55.997
Wow, look at all this.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.375
So you are talented
at something.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.001
- I can do one thing.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.087
Meeting Ro was a little odd.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.841
<i> But honestly, I'm happy</i>
<i> if Kate's happy.</i>

07:05.883 --> 07:08.385
Seriously.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.761
- Bye, Kyle.

07:09.795 --> 07:11.430
- That's the real deal.
- Mwuah.

07:11.464 --> 07:12.889
- Ciao.
- Be good.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.224
- You too.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.684
Bye.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.060
- Take care of this one, yeah?
- I will.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.770
I'll look out for her.
- Thanks.

07:18.804 --> 07:20.564
- It's always hard to
say good-bye to Ro.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.732
It's hard to say good-bye
to Ro on FaceTime.

07:22.775 --> 07:26.278
<i> So in person,</i>
<i> it's more difficult.</i>

07:26.312 --> 07:27.779
- All right, homegirl.
- See you, bye.

07:27.813 --> 07:29.906
Let me see that bag.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.908
Ha, oh, you're leaving things
behind, huh?

07:31.951 --> 07:33.910
- Uh-huh.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.620
<i> I won't be seeing Ro in person</i>

07:35.654 --> 07:38.373
<i> until after the season's over</i>
<i> and I fly back.</i>

07:40.251 --> 07:42.794
But at least we had this
little midpoint check-in.

07:42.828 --> 07:44.296
- One more?
- Mm-hmm.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.256
- One more?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.632
- That might have been
the best night of sleep

07:47.666 --> 07:50.093
I've had in
at least three weeks.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.553
- Good-bye, baby girl.
- Bye.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.096
- Bye.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.931
Ta-ta for now.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.226
<i> - Kelley, Kelley; Lee.</i>

07:58.269 --> 08:00.312
Your latest project has arrived.

08:00.346 --> 08:01.730
<i> - Roger that.</i>

08:01.772 --> 08:03.648
<i> Nico and Kyle to the dock,</i>
<i> please.</i>

08:03.682 --> 08:05.942
This thing's gonna be heavy.
It's the slide.

08:07.653 --> 08:11.406
I hate slides.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.242
Oh, Jesus.
Ready?

08:14.285 --> 08:16.119
Oh.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.332
Oh, I hope I never have to set
this f---ing thing up again.

08:20.366 --> 08:22.584
I'm gonna go into
this positive and say

08:22.627 --> 08:24.419
I'm gonna whoop that
mother----er's ass.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.087
That's a big f---ing box.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.423
- Wait.
- Is he out the door?

08:28.466 --> 08:29.674
F---ing f---!

08:29.708 --> 08:31.343
- There it is.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.845
Casualty number one.

08:33.879 --> 08:36.473
- All right, three, two, one.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.016
- Ow!
- Again?

08:38.050 --> 08:39.809
- Right, this f--- is gonna--

08:39.852 --> 08:41.269
- I'm quitting.
I'm out of here.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.188
That slide changed my life.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.857
I f---ing banged me head,
me legs, me hands.

08:45.891 --> 08:47.025
Just a pain in the ass.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.193
- Down.

08:48.227 --> 08:49.528
All right, now we got to get it

08:49.562 --> 08:51.279
strapped around this
mother----er.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.697
- Let's pick it up.
I'm gonna go get the davit.

08:52.731 --> 08:54.282
- Wait a minute, Kelley.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.951
The best thing we can do
with this thing right now

08:55.993 --> 08:58.995
is unfold it here on the dock,

08:59.038 --> 09:01.498
because we don't have any room
up there to unroll it.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.958
- Roger that.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.334
Just dump 'er
and open 'er up.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.003
Ready?
One, two, three.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.382
- See anything that looks like
any paperwork or anything yet?

09:10.416 --> 09:12.342
- Pump.
Repair kit.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.552
There's our lifting harness.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.719
- That's good. Yep, yep.

09:14.753 --> 09:16.846
- All right,
back up for a sec.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.181
- Kelley, for deployment,

09:18.224 --> 09:19.808
this is gonna have to be
out of the way.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.184
Come on over a little bit,
Kelley,

09:21.227 --> 09:22.686
to the right.
- Yes, sir.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.354
<i> Captain holds me</i>
<i> to high standards,</i>

09:24.397 --> 09:27.023
but he's also trying to
micromanage the sh-- out of me.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.234
Is it frustrating as hell?
F--- yeah.

09:31.103 --> 09:32.862
Awesome.
- Little bit more.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.574
- Roger that.

09:38.611 --> 09:41.871
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

09:41.914 --> 09:43.915
- What's up?
- Nothing, I'm just thinking.

09:43.949 --> 09:46.668
So how'd you get into boats?
- I was in the army.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.713
And then I got into
fishing trawlers and yachts.

09:49.755 --> 09:50.839
So how long have you
been in yachting now?

09:50.881 --> 09:52.007
- Three months.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.049
- And how old
did you say you were?

09:53.092 --> 09:54.217
- I'm 27.
- 27...

09:55.961 --> 09:57.095
- Yeah.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.183
What?

10:02.226 --> 10:05.103
I'd love to take you
on a date with me.

10:05.137 --> 10:06.771
- Okay.
Yeah, that'd be cool.

10:09.642 --> 10:10.859
You're nice. Cool.
Dinner? Let's do it.

10:10.901 --> 10:11.901
<i>Which...</i>

10:12.978 --> 10:14.613
I love fishing
and I love food.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.281
- So, like, I'm either getting
a free meal...

10:16.315 --> 10:17.532
- Up top.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.284
- Or a fishing trip.
- Free meal?

10:19.318 --> 10:20.910
- Yeah.
- So I'm paying for dinner?

10:20.953 --> 10:23.038
- That's what
"take you out" usually means.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.123
- Oh, I--I thought you were
gonna pay for me,

10:25.157 --> 10:26.791
but I don't really care; cool.
- Oh.

10:26.825 --> 10:29.294
Kyle's definitely
an entertaining guy,

10:29.328 --> 10:31.755
even if I don't understand
every word he says.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.632
We'll go Dutch.
- No.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.050
I'll pay for dinner.
- That's your steez, right?

10:35.092 --> 10:36.426
Belgian?

10:37.670 --> 10:40.138
- Belgian's Flemish, but okay.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.640
<i> - Coming up...</i>

10:43.643 --> 10:45.101
- What the hell?

10:49.848 --> 10:52.233
- Ems, do you want
a cup of tea?

10:52.276 --> 10:54.319
- Yes, please.
Thank you.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.321
- You know,
they could be really cute.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.156
What kind of tea
did you make her?

10:58.190 --> 11:00.992
- I made her
green tea with acai.

11:01.026 --> 11:04.829
- Wow; you guys can have
after-dinner tea together too.

11:04.863 --> 11:07.332
- Yeah.
Uh--yeah, yeah.

11:13.372 --> 11:14.506
- Yeah, go walk down
to the dock.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.507
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:15.541 --> 11:16.508
- Okay.

11:16.542 --> 11:17.509
<i> Sierra?</i>

11:19.545 --> 11:21.513
- Yes.
- Just get my shoes on, okay?

11:23.349 --> 11:25.141
Soon as I get a paycheck
it's going straight to her.

11:29.888 --> 11:31.189
Let's go.

11:31.223 --> 11:32.482
<i> I took her out on a date...</i>

11:40.065 --> 11:42.617
- It's Valentine's Day tomorrow.
- It is.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.285
- What you gonna do?

11:44.328 --> 11:46.162
- I always have really
bad luck on Valentine's Day.

11:48.741 --> 11:50.208
What are you sending
money home for?

11:50.242 --> 11:52.460
- My daughter.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.712
- Oh.
- Yeah.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.380
- I didn't know you had one.

11:55.414 --> 11:56.673
- Didn't you?
- Mm-mm.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.341
So why aren't
you guys together?

12:00.252 --> 12:01.970
- 'Cause it might--
it's just the way it is.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.888
But she'll never have a work--
have to work again.

12:03.922 --> 12:04.973
I'll make sure of that.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.725
- I think it's so noble

12:06.759 --> 12:09.561
for Kyle to want to provide
for the mother of his child,

12:09.595 --> 12:12.230
but, like, it's kind of
a red flag.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.065
How old is she?

12:14.099 --> 12:15.483
- I don't like to say--
'cause it turns people off

12:15.526 --> 12:17.152
a little bit.
- In what way?

12:17.194 --> 12:18.903
- Well, if you're trying to,
like, get to know a girl

12:18.937 --> 12:20.238
and when they found out you got
a kid, it's like "Whoa!"

12:20.272 --> 12:21.322
- It's a lot of pressure.
- Yeah.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.365
- Yeah.

12:25.444 --> 12:26.453
So how old is she?

12:27.613 --> 12:30.206
- Oh, wow.

12:33.252 --> 12:37.547
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

12:37.590 --> 12:39.841
- Kate, Ben, Kelley,
I need all of you

12:39.884 --> 12:42.260
in the crew mess for
a preference sheet meeting.

12:42.294 --> 12:45.555
- Roger.
- Copy.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.806
- Let's go, sports fans.

12:49.635 --> 12:52.771
All right, Steve Haug
and Rachel Belmont

12:52.805 --> 12:54.272
are the primaries.

12:54.306 --> 12:56.024
- They're a--attractive couple.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.026
This looks like a
"Dancing with the Stars"

12:58.068 --> 12:59.527
posing photo.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.945
- He's a financial planner.

13:00.979 --> 13:03.573
He wants this trip with
his friends to celebrate

13:03.616 --> 13:05.617
"life and Valentine's Day."

13:05.651 --> 13:07.619
So Frank is their best friend.

13:07.653 --> 13:09.871
Gail is a business partner
turned friend.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.582
And her daughter, Madison,
is coming with.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.376
And Steve wants to surprise
Rachel by proposing

13:15.419 --> 13:17.462
on the first night
of the charter so they can

13:17.496 --> 13:19.631
celebrate the whole trip.
- Wow.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.132
- Don't you think he should
do it the second night

13:21.166 --> 13:23.635
because it might ruin the trip
if she says no.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.386
- That's not my call.
- Oh, okay.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.806
- But we should have
a contingency plan.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.265
In case she does.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.100
- Lifeboats.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.394
How did you propose
to your wife, Captain Lee?

13:33.437 --> 13:35.980
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

13:36.014 --> 13:39.317
- I just asked her
if she wanted to marry me.

13:39.351 --> 13:42.779
Anyhow, back to the preferences.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.493
Hey, do you want sushi?
- Yes, thank you.

13:48.527 --> 13:53.915
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

13:58.537 --> 14:00.839
- Wow, that salmon
looks amazing.

14:00.873 --> 14:01.965
- What a feast.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.300
- Rainbows are so in
in 2016.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.928
- I think it's a very
free-spirited outlook.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.179
I think it's incredible.

14:08.213 --> 14:09.347
- Thanks, babe.

14:09.381 --> 14:10.849
<i>- I mean, I like women as well.</i>

14:10.883 --> 14:12.851
I mean, I don't blame her,
to be honest.

14:12.885 --> 14:15.770
I would be a big, big lesbian
if I could.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.439
Given the chance.

14:18.482 --> 14:21.025
Okay, that's looking
fine and dandy.

14:21.059 --> 14:23.862
Good night.

14:27.032 --> 14:33.204
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

14:33.238 --> 14:35.206
- Happy Valentine's Day, Emily.

14:37.743 --> 14:39.878
- Did you get any messages?
- No.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.546
- No?
- What about you?

14:41.580 --> 14:44.132
- No.
- So you don't have a valentine

14:44.174 --> 14:45.216
is what you're saying?

14:45.250 --> 14:46.718
- I don't have a valentine, no.

14:46.752 --> 14:49.012
- We might have to change that.

14:51.223 --> 14:55.435
- I'm trying to signal,
"No, don't ask me out, please."

15:04.028 --> 15:06.738
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

15:06.772 --> 15:08.197
Christ, what the hell
happened here?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.741
<i> It's rude.</i>

15:09.775 --> 15:11.200
I don't want to get up
and see that crap.

15:13.111 --> 15:14.871
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.040
So laundry's being turned over.
- Yes.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.750
- Oh, we've got some wine
in the main salon

15:18.784 --> 15:20.001
that I think we should
just divide.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.586
- Okay.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.713
- Uh, did you call anybody
for Valentine's Day?

15:23.756 --> 15:26.007
- Sent a couple messages
to friends and things.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.301
- Yeah?
- Don't have a valentine.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.056
- What?
- I know.

15:38.395 --> 15:43.775
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

15:43.809 --> 15:45.234
- I just talked to Emily.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.904
She said no one's ever
sent her flowers ever.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.449
Wouldn't it be nice
if somebody on the crew

15:51.483 --> 15:53.409
gave her flowers?

15:53.452 --> 15:55.078
- That would be lovely.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.706
- I have a flower order coming.
You want me to add to it?

15:58.749 --> 16:00.458
- I would like that.
- Okay.

16:00.492 --> 16:02.460
I think maybe you could do
a little bit of yellow,

16:02.494 --> 16:04.420
with, like, maybe
some light pink in there

16:04.463 --> 16:06.297
'cause it's like,
"we're friends, but there

16:06.331 --> 16:08.549
could be something
going closer to red."

16:08.592 --> 16:10.760
- Mm, I don't want
to scare the poor girl.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.428
- Oh, I don't think
she'll be scared.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.721
- Oh.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.140
- I think she'll be
super flattered.

16:16.174 --> 16:17.767
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.310
I've seen the kind of girls
Ben likes to date.

16:19.344 --> 16:21.813
They're always much younger
and very thin.

16:21.847 --> 16:24.774
So I think the fact that
Emily is also intelligent

16:24.817 --> 16:27.276
and has a nice
British upbringing

16:27.319 --> 16:28.611
makes her perfect.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.655
- Cheers.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.240
- Kelley, Kelley; Lee.

16:32.282 --> 16:33.950
- Go for Kelley.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.618
<i> - I need you to come up</i>
<i> to the dining area</i>

16:35.661 --> 16:38.413
and clean up some leftover food.
<i> - Roger that.</i>

16:38.455 --> 16:39.789
<i> - I'm not your mother.</i>

16:39.832 --> 16:42.500
I'm not gonna
clean up after you.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.838
- How the f--- is the sushi
the deck crew?

16:46.872 --> 16:50.925
Because that was
Ben, Kate, Emily, and me.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.760
- Oy.

16:54.713 --> 16:56.139
- Off who?

16:56.181 --> 16:59.308
- Lee, for the sushi,
for leaving the sushi out.

17:04.890 --> 17:09.861
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

17:09.895 --> 17:13.197
- Kate, Kate, you have
a delivery on the dock.

17:13.231 --> 17:16.367
- Thank you.

17:19.404 --> 17:21.372
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

17:21.406 --> 17:23.041
Ben, the eagle has landed.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.625
- What?

17:24.668 --> 17:26.586
- We're gonna make them look
not so cheeseball.

17:28.914 --> 17:30.798
- I don't know.
- What's the matter?

17:30.841 --> 17:32.842
- I think maybe there should be
a little bit of baby breath

17:32.885 --> 17:35.136
between the roses.
- What?

17:35.179 --> 17:38.139
You seem a little nervous,
Benji.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.725
we have
30 minutes till guests' arrival.

17:40.759 --> 17:42.226
30 minutes till guests' arrival.

17:45.263 --> 17:52.195
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

17:54.940 --> 17:57.158
<i> - I'm not sure if it's a</i>

17:57.201 --> 17:59.994
presumptuous position
for me to be the first one

18:00.037 --> 18:01.746
to ever give her flowers.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.039
- Here we go, sports fan.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.708
<i> - But I'm gonna do it anyway.</i>

18:05.751 --> 18:07.543
I think this is rock and roll.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.506
- Hi.
Happy Valentine's Day.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.715
- Oh, my gosh,
it's so big.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.675
- Where is Ben?

18:14.718 --> 18:15.760
- Uh.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.264
- Ben, get up here now.

18:20.298 --> 18:21.349
- After you, my love.

18:21.391 --> 18:22.892
- It's so pretty.

18:22.935 --> 18:23.935
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

18:23.969 --> 18:25.436
- I am so excited.

18:27.973 --> 18:29.190
<i> - Coming up...</i>

18:29.233 --> 18:30.608
<i> - The wind's going one way;</i>

18:30.642 --> 18:32.443
<i> The current's going</i>
<i> the other way.</i>

18:32.477 --> 18:34.278
<i> What are you doing?</i>
<i> This is f---ing embarrassing.</i>

18:34.312 --> 18:35.988
- I'm on my way down.
It's not that goddamn tough.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.535
<i> - Where is Ben?</i>

18:40.577 --> 18:42.745
- I am so excited.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.292
- I'm--no, I'm not gonna say it.
- I'm still late.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.962
- Hi.
- How you doing?

18:50.996 --> 18:52.421
- I'm Rachel.
- Rachel, I'm Captain Lee.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.589
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

18:53.632 --> 18:54.882
- Steve.
- Hi, welcome Rachel.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.634
- Hi, I'm Gail.
- Madison.

18:56.668 --> 18:58.261
- Kelley.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.804
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you, Lauren.

18:59.838 --> 19:01.264
- Happy Valentine's Day
to everyone.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.057
- Ooh.
- Happy Valentine's Day.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.976
- We're gonna get underway
rather quickly

19:05.010 --> 19:07.103
so I'm gonna have Kate, she'll
give you a tour of the boat.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.063
- Let's do it.
- Right this way, guys.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.565
<i> So this is our main salon.</i>

19:10.607 --> 19:12.775
We have a formal dining table.
- Oh, wow.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.485
- And now we'll go on
to the master suite first.

19:14.519 --> 19:16.654
It's a really beautiful boat.
It just got refitted,

19:16.688 --> 19:18.322
<i> so everything's new.</i>
<i> - Beautiful.</i>

19:18.356 --> 19:20.825
- And then,
your master bathroom is here.

19:20.859 --> 19:23.828
The best part of this bathroom
is the robot toilet.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.955
I like to call it
"R2-Poo2."

19:27.958 --> 19:29.500
<i> - And this is the sun deck.</i>

19:29.534 --> 19:30.835
<i> This is our Jacuzzi</i>
<i> with a nice view.</i>

19:30.869 --> 19:32.336
<i> Very nice.</i>
<i> - Yeah, real cool.</i>

19:32.370 --> 19:34.630
- We're bigger than those boats.
- We are.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.257
- We make them
look like our bitches.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.134
- We're f----ing crushing it.

19:41.180 --> 19:45.892
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

19:51.190 --> 19:52.481
- Oh.

19:54.651 --> 19:55.651
What the hell?

19:59.990 --> 20:01.866
It's so sweet.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.035
<i> I was totally shocked.</i>

20:04.069 --> 20:05.494
<i> It really touched my heart.</i>

20:05.537 --> 20:08.831
And I felt that feeling
when you can't

20:08.874 --> 20:10.416
take a smile off your mouth.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.003
Wow.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.966
- I need a hidden conversation
with you.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.384
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:20.418 --> 20:21.677
- Hi.

20:23.922 --> 20:25.389
- Did you want to do it in front
of your friends or in private?

20:25.423 --> 20:27.016
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yes? Okay.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.352
Set up candles;
we've got roses.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.728
Be a little bit romantic?
- Awesome.

20:30.762 --> 20:32.396
- Yeah.
- Also, the ring

20:32.430 --> 20:34.649
is in my backpack in a sock.
- Okay.

20:34.691 --> 20:35.983
- If someone could get it
from my backpack

20:36.026 --> 20:37.693
and give it to Frank?
- Sure, okay.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.862
- Yeah.
- Awesome, this is exciting.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.572
- Happy Valentine's Day.

20:41.606 --> 20:44.325
I'm gonna have to--
everybody's gonna have to share.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.743
- Ben.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.328
- How's it going?

20:47.371 --> 20:48.329
- That was amazing.
I loved it.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.538
- Happy Valentine's Day.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.831
- Thank you.
- What happened?

20:50.874 --> 20:52.083
- Well, you're welcome.

20:52.117 --> 20:54.252
- Some blue roses
in my bed.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.754
- Aw. This guy.

20:56.788 --> 20:58.547
- I surprise people sometimes.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.675
<i> - One of the main things</i>
<i> I was surprised about is</i>

21:00.717 --> 21:02.051
how a gesture like that

21:02.094 --> 21:04.345
can change
your feelings about someone.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.347
I'll be smiling all day.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.515
- That's what I wanted,
so, perfect.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.016
- Thank you.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.102
- I just couldn't believe it,
so I had to do it.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.603
- Everybody in position.

21:12.637 --> 21:13.854
<i> - Kyle's in position.</i>

21:13.897 --> 21:15.189
<i> - Em's in position.</i>

21:15.232 --> 21:16.691
- Roger that.
We'll go bow to stern.

21:16.733 --> 21:17.733
<i>Bow to stern.</i>

21:19.736 --> 21:22.780
- The ring is in
his backpack in a sock.

21:22.814 --> 21:26.117
When you find that,
give it to me, yeah.

21:26.151 --> 21:27.618
Okay, they're out.
- Gonna go?

21:27.652 --> 21:28.953
- Yeah.

21:28.987 --> 21:30.246
- Thanks, man.
Stern's all clear.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.622
All lines clear, Captain.

21:34.626 --> 21:41.632
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

21:44.303 --> 21:46.220
- I'm--I'm so old;
it's insane.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.639
- All right, let's do this.
<i> - Roger that.</i>

21:51.676 --> 21:53.436
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

21:53.478 --> 21:55.146
- How many people get to
experience

21:55.180 --> 21:57.148
something this amazing?
- No, I agree, it's beautiful.

21:57.182 --> 21:58.983
- I'll tell you right now,
I am definitely

21:59.017 --> 22:01.319
jumping off
the top of this boat.

22:01.353 --> 22:03.487
- Let's check it out.

22:03.521 --> 22:05.114
- Sierra, I'll never
find another

22:05.157 --> 22:07.325
third stew quite like you.

22:07.359 --> 22:09.827
- If you would be
my laundry girl?

22:09.861 --> 22:11.829
- I don't think I can
commit to that.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.167
- It's damn--
it does look good on me.

22:16.201 --> 22:18.002
This ring is huge,

22:18.036 --> 22:19.628
<i> but gorgeous.</i>

22:19.671 --> 22:20.838
- There's your future.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.923
- It feels so right.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.009
So obviously I'm gonna
go give this to somebody else.

22:25.043 --> 22:26.510
- Okay.

22:26.544 --> 22:28.596
<i> - On my mark,</i>
<i> give me two shots.</i>

22:34.552 --> 22:37.355
Lock it into deuce.

22:37.389 --> 22:38.981
- She's not gonna
go in any of these drawers

22:39.024 --> 22:40.441
so we can put it in here.
- This is good?

22:40.484 --> 22:42.026
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Okay.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.362
- There's a bunch of flowers
on my bed.

22:44.396 --> 22:45.488
Blue roses.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.323
- Who are they from?
- Guess.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.492
- Is it Kyle?

22:49.534 --> 22:51.994
- No.
- Ben?

22:52.037 --> 22:53.704
- Yeah.
- No.

22:53.738 --> 22:57.124
- I'm so happy.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.876
How cute.

23:02.414 --> 23:03.672
- Hey, Ben, the guests
are at the table.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.508
- Just give me
one second, please.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.219
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

23:08.253 --> 23:10.137
Seared ahi, spicy mayo.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.556
- Okay.
- Cheers.

23:12.590 --> 23:14.558
- Here we have seared ahi tuna,

23:14.592 --> 23:18.729
sushi rice, spicy mayonnaise,
and sweet glass noodles.

23:18.763 --> 23:19.730
- Cool.
- Beautiful.

23:19.764 --> 23:21.232
- This is amazing.

23:21.266 --> 23:23.859
- Oh, my God,
they are unbelievably good.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.861
- Oh, beautiful.
- Spicy lobster salad.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.238
- Love it.

23:27.272 --> 23:29.990
He's not playing around.
- No.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.033
- That's fire.

23:34.946 --> 23:37.706
- Get under there
and untie it now.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.875
<i> - I've been doing this</i>
<i> long enough now that I know</i>

23:39.918 --> 23:41.877
the guests usually
just want all the toys.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.754
Let it go a little bit longer.

23:43.788 --> 23:45.047
Let it go, let it go.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.090
No, no, no.

23:46.124 --> 23:47.883
So you want proactive, Captain?

23:47.926 --> 23:49.385
All the toys are going out.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.137
Give it about 15 seconds longer.

23:54.299 --> 23:55.891
- So you guys are gonna
snorkel too?

23:55.934 --> 23:57.226
- Mm-hmm.
- Awesome.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.562
- Are you--
- I'll probably not.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.397
- Hi, guys, how's it going?
- Good.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.023
- Love to do some snorkeling.
- Snorkel?

24:03.066 --> 24:04.233
Yeah, want to get in the water?

24:04.276 --> 24:06.277
- Yeah.
- All right, awesome.

24:06.311 --> 24:07.945
I'll check with everyone else.
We'll get that set up for you.

24:07.979 --> 24:09.113
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

24:09.147 --> 24:10.698
- You ready?

24:10.740 --> 24:11.907
- That's one.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.200
All the way down.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.286
- Control it.
Controlled pull-up.

24:17.155 --> 24:18.414
- How many's going?

24:18.457 --> 24:20.124
- Um, they all want to go.

24:20.158 --> 24:22.751
- I'll take Kyle.
- Yeah.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.253
- So what are we doing?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.964
- What are the plans, Stans?
- I don't know.

24:26.998 --> 24:29.133
- Let's just give 'em goggles
and put 'em in the hot tub.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.634
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

24:30.668 --> 24:32.094
- Hey, you guys know
if we're going out soon?

24:32.137 --> 24:33.721
- Yeah, do--do you want
to go snorkeling?

24:33.763 --> 24:35.139
- Yeah.
- When? Right now?

24:35.173 --> 24:36.265
- Yeah.
- All right, we'll get

24:36.308 --> 24:37.433
the boat pulled around.
- Cool.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.809
- Oh, sh--.

24:38.843 --> 24:40.102
- Good lunch, Ben.
The guests are so happy.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.562
- That's awesome.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.814
Now, for the most important
dinner in the world...

24:43.848 --> 24:45.232
Apparently.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.568
The proposal--
do you think a red velvet cake,

24:47.611 --> 24:50.279
like a red, yeah.
- Oh, good idea.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.948
- Yeah.
- Red, and it's Valentine's Day.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.658
- Yeah.
- All the rest of it.

24:54.692 --> 24:56.660
- Do you think she's gonna cry?
She might cry.

24:56.694 --> 24:58.746
- She's not in love
if she doesn't cry.

24:58.788 --> 24:59.830
Let's do--let's say that.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.335
- So you're staying here?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.754
We just got to let
the pool off of it.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.964
- We got to let the pool
slide out to the side.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.132
That way,
once I'm alongside,

25:10.175 --> 25:11.842
you can just
hand 'em over to me.

25:11.876 --> 25:14.136
<i> Nico, just under your corner,</i>
<i> let it swing out.</i>

25:14.179 --> 25:18.432
<i> Then attach that yellow line</i>
<i> to the port aft corner.</i>

25:18.475 --> 25:20.351
- With the current,
it's not gonna work this way.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.980
<i> - So we're trying to get</i>
<i> the Intrepid in so we can</i>

25:25.023 --> 25:26.982
line it up for the guests to
come onboard for snorkeling.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.609
<i> But the pool</i>
<i> is just in the way.</i>

25:28.652 --> 25:31.320
- Kelley, you ready?

25:31.363 --> 25:32.446
- Just got to wait.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.697
<i> I got it.</i>

25:37.569 --> 25:40.120
- That means he's serious.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.834
- The wind's going one way, the
current's going the other way.

25:45.877 --> 25:49.713
And, you know,
it's a recipe for disaster.

25:49.747 --> 25:51.549
- There you go.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.801
- This thing is
a pain in the ass, isn't it?

25:53.843 --> 25:55.844
<i> - Kelley's like, maybe if we,</i>
<i> like, ram the tender</i>

25:55.887 --> 25:57.471
<i> into the pool</i>
<i> and push it out the way,</i>

25:57.514 --> 25:59.473
it'll happen,
but every time he pulled back,

25:59.516 --> 26:00.849
<i>the pool just quickly swung in.</i>

26:00.892 --> 26:02.059
- Go ahead, back out of there,
Kelley,

26:02.093 --> 26:03.519
<i> as soon as she gets it loose.</i>

26:03.562 --> 26:05.646
- The guests are
standing there watching us,

26:05.689 --> 26:06.689
and we're like.

26:06.731 --> 26:10.734
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

26:10.768 --> 26:12.152
- I'm on my way down.

26:12.195 --> 26:14.196
- Oh, God, just let me
do this alone.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.991
<i> Here we go again with</i>
<i> Captain Lee, micromanaging.</i>

26:17.033 --> 26:19.577
- Jesus Christ, could f--- up
a two-car funeral.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.912
It's not that goddamn tough.

26:21.946 --> 26:23.247
<i> - Coming up...</i>

26:23.281 --> 26:24.707
- I'd like to, uh,
make a little toast.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.375
- Aw.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.418
<i> - This could either be</i>
<i> really good or really bad.</i>

26:27.452 --> 26:28.877
- Rachel...

26:32.841 --> 26:35.092
- Just go ahead and back out of
there, Kelley,

26:35.126 --> 26:36.677
as soon as she gets it loose.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.262
<i> - Yeah, she's got it</i>
<i> all tangled up.</i>

26:38.296 --> 26:40.180
<i> - Never mind.</i>
<i> I'm on my way down.</i>

26:40.223 --> 26:41.890
- I don't need you
a part of this right now.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.059
- F--- up a two-car funeral.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.060
- F---ing terrible idea.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.270
- Okay, what you need to do is

26:46.304 --> 26:47.938
pay attention to
what this is doing.

26:47.972 --> 26:50.274
You got to adapt to whatever's
happening in the water.

26:50.308 --> 26:51.692
- Yes, sir.
- Kelley, bring it in

26:51.735 --> 26:53.777
starboard side two,
you have plenty of room.

26:53.811 --> 26:55.112
- Okay, Cap.

26:55.146 --> 26:56.780
- He didn't bring
the bow line in tight,

26:56.814 --> 26:59.283
so then the pool got wedged
between the boat and the thing.

26:59.317 --> 27:01.785
Go ahead, bring it in.

27:01.819 --> 27:04.580
- F---.
- Take it around again.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.624
- Yeah.
- Take that line up here.

27:06.658 --> 27:08.292
- I think Kelley's
feeling the pressure.

27:08.326 --> 27:10.961
<i> He's constantly having</i>
<i> his progress evaluated.</i>

27:10.995 --> 27:12.713
You know, he puts
that pressure onto us when

27:12.756 --> 27:14.131
Captain puts that on him,
and that's sort of how

27:14.165 --> 27:15.924
the ranking trickles.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.718
- Why do you keep leaving
the bow lines out like that?

27:17.761 --> 27:19.887
And now you got so many
wrapped, you can't control it.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.555
- Get that bow tighter.
- Come on.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.891
We really don't look like
seasoned professionals.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.726
They teach you how to do that
in the Navy?

27:25.769 --> 27:26.935
You need some lessons
in line handling.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.312
<i> We look more like</i>

27:28.346 --> 27:31.273
the Keystone Kops meets
the Three Stooges.

27:36.187 --> 27:37.655
- Let's get people down here
and get 'em moving

27:37.689 --> 27:39.698
<i> so they can enjoy</i>
<i> some of this day.</i>

27:41.526 --> 27:43.661
- Yes, sir.
- Give me your radio.

27:43.695 --> 27:45.162
I want you pushing the pool off.

27:45.196 --> 27:47.122
Kelley, turn
your wheel starboard.

27:48.866 --> 27:50.459
Get the stern off.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.003
And take it forward.

27:53.037 --> 27:54.296
Get it up.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.801
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.011
- Finally.

28:01.045 --> 28:03.681
- Are you guys leaving me?

28:03.715 --> 28:05.474
<i> - Oops.</i>

28:05.517 --> 28:07.351
- Run back in the same way
you did before, Kelley.

28:07.385 --> 28:08.811
<i> - Roger that.</i>

28:08.853 --> 28:10.813
What are you guys doing?

28:10.855 --> 28:12.356
<i> I've worked on big boats</i>
<i> and I've never really seen</i>

28:12.390 --> 28:13.524
<i> such a sh-- show.</i>

28:13.558 --> 28:14.858
- Line up.
- Ah.

28:14.892 --> 28:17.486
- There you go.
- Thank you.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.654
- You're good.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.990
- That was f---ing embarrassing.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.328
<i> - Is that smoke?</i>

28:26.371 --> 28:27.621
- F---.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.791
That is really bad.
Sh--e.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.001
- Did you know that
Kyle has a daughter?

28:33.044 --> 28:36.171
- You don't know?
- No, I didn't know.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.382
- Yeah, I knew on the first day.
- Literally, had no one--

28:38.416 --> 28:42.052
said anything to me.
I had no idea.

28:42.086 --> 28:44.555
I'm not gonna say
it put me off,

28:44.589 --> 28:45.973
like...

28:46.015 --> 28:47.975
- But?
- It's a lot of pressure.

28:48.017 --> 28:50.060
<i> - Well, understandably, yes.</i>

28:50.094 --> 28:53.147
- So, defogging their masks,
yours goes last.

28:53.189 --> 28:55.149
Be careful,
go--watch this.

28:58.194 --> 29:05.200

29:12.417 --> 29:13.709
Keep an eye on the guests.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.754
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

29:16.788 --> 29:18.672
Worst day ever.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.382
<i> Why does everything</i>
<i> backfire on me?</i>

29:20.425 --> 29:24.261
Being proactive backfires on me,
I mean, it just--

29:24.295 --> 29:27.931
this charter season
is kicking my ass.

29:27.965 --> 29:29.933
- Time to put this
bad boy to bed.

29:29.967 --> 29:31.393
Hang on, Nico,
we'll get you in.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.394
The pool's coming in.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.937
<i> - Thank you, bosun.</i>

29:33.971 --> 29:35.522
<i> You're gonna go</i>
<i> on a snorkeling trip,</i>

29:35.565 --> 29:37.775
and we're gonna have fun
putting away the pool.

29:37.809 --> 29:40.068
<i> I mean, the guests</i>
<i> didn't ask for it.</i>

29:40.111 --> 29:41.403
<i> They didn't use it.</i>

29:41.446 --> 29:42.446
So thanks a lot, pal.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.072
- Whoo!

29:44.115 --> 29:47.117
I need some more
lead in my pencil.

29:50.154 --> 29:53.123
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

29:53.157 --> 29:55.083
- Motor, yacht "Valor,"
motor, yacht "Valor,"

29:55.126 --> 29:57.211
I'm about five minutes out
with the guests.

29:57.253 --> 29:58.212
- Copy, thank you.

29:58.254 --> 30:00.130
- Nico and Lauren,

30:00.164 --> 30:01.381
<i> can you get on the, uh,</i>
<i> aft deck</i>

30:01.424 --> 30:02.758
to help get the guests off?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.468
- All right.
Copy that.

30:04.502 --> 30:07.137
- The pool's up!

30:07.171 --> 30:09.097
Just watch your head
when you step up.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.474
All right, man.

30:10.508 --> 30:12.559
- Thank you, sir.
- No worries.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.148
- You looking forward
to getting off again?

30:18.182 --> 30:19.233
- Yeah, I am.

30:19.275 --> 30:20.734
Hopefully no drama

30:20.777 --> 30:21.819
and no one gets attitude.

30:21.853 --> 30:23.403
- I know.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.781
And Kyle and, um,
Sierra are going on a date.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.658
<i> - Are they?</i>
<i> - Yes.</i>

30:27.692 --> 30:28.992
<i> They're going fishing</i>
<i> over dinner.</i>

30:29.026 --> 30:30.327
- Fishing?
- Yes.

30:30.361 --> 30:32.329
- We're going.

30:32.363 --> 30:33.455
- Do you want to go
on a date with me?

30:33.498 --> 30:34.915
I want to go fishing.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.500
- Fishing's not really my thing.

30:36.534 --> 30:38.418
- Yeah.

30:38.461 --> 30:39.795
<i> - I feel bad because</i>

30:39.838 --> 30:41.505
I know that Kelley
has feelings for me,

30:41.539 --> 30:43.298
and I don't want to hurt him.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.175
And I don't want this
to affect our friendship.

30:45.209 --> 30:48.470
<i> But I like Ben; I clearly</i>
<i> get on very well with him.</i>

30:48.513 --> 30:50.264
It's slightly awkward.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.849
- All right, I got to
get back there and help them.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.475
I'll chat with you in a bit.
Enjoy your break.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.685
- Thank you.

30:54.719 --> 30:56.603
<i>I'll try not to fall overboard.</i>

30:59.649 --> 31:04.361
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

31:04.395 --> 31:06.613
- This is like the
witching hour right now.

31:06.656 --> 31:10.367
I've actually never cooked
a proposal dinner before.

31:10.401 --> 31:13.036
So it's actually a little bit
nerve-wracking.

31:13.070 --> 31:14.830
Can you imagine if
she said no

31:14.873 --> 31:17.666
because I overcooked her steak
or something?

31:20.712 --> 31:27.676
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

31:30.087 --> 31:32.222
- Oh, that's awesome.
- They did a great job, huh?

31:32.256 --> 31:34.308
- Thank you so much.
- I'm so excited.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.560
I just got goose bumps.
It's so exciting.

31:36.594 --> 31:39.021
There is so much love
everywhere.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.689
The charter guests
are celebrating love.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.065
The crew members are in love.

31:42.099 --> 31:43.734
<i> It's Valentine's Day.</i>

31:43.768 --> 31:45.986
Ah--it's just too much.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.237
- He got to practice on me.
- Yeah.

31:47.271 --> 31:48.864
- I said yes.
- I was practicing

31:48.907 --> 31:50.574
with him before.
- Oh that's--that's really cute.

31:50.608 --> 31:52.367
- 'Cause I--I haven't
said it out loud yet.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.911
I haven't, like, gone
through it all, so I was like,

31:53.945 --> 31:55.412
"I need to practice on you."
- That was smart.

31:55.446 --> 31:56.580
- Hope--hopefully
I'm not a mumbling idiot.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.381
Who's Ryan?

32:06.424 --> 32:08.926
He just wanted to talk, I guess.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.385
So we could hang out.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.012
- But you're going
fishing with him?

32:12.055 --> 32:13.597
<i> - He says it's on.</i>
<i> He's like,</i>

32:13.631 --> 32:15.098
<i> "We can go to dinner after</i>
<i> if you want."</i>

32:15.132 --> 32:17.351
I was like, "Yeah, we can
totally go to dinner."

32:17.393 --> 32:18.435
- You could, like,
barbeque on the beach.

32:18.469 --> 32:19.937
- It's just dinner.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.438
<i> In my mind,</i>
<i> it's not a date.</i>

32:21.472 --> 32:23.190
<i> I don't want</i>
<i> to make it a big deal.</i>

32:23.232 --> 32:24.942
I just want to
go and hang out

32:24.976 --> 32:26.276
and get to know each other.

32:26.310 --> 32:28.028
<i> He doesn't even know me yet.</i>

32:28.071 --> 32:29.446
I could--have two heads.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.365
You know, for all he knows.

32:31.407 --> 32:33.116
- No, but it's nice he actually
came and spoke to you though.

32:33.150 --> 32:36.119
That he's wanting to

32:36.153 --> 32:37.412
court you.

32:39.323 --> 32:41.124
- Oh, Rachel, come sit by me.
- Okay.

32:41.158 --> 32:42.292
- Sit next to the boys.

32:42.326 --> 32:43.543
- Wait, are you a lefty?

32:43.586 --> 32:46.254
- I love that you colored it
red.

32:48.165 --> 32:50.133
- Love is in the air.

32:50.167 --> 32:52.219
- Come on, let's not get too,
you know...

32:52.261 --> 32:54.471
- You've been infected
by the love bug.

32:54.505 --> 32:56.807
- Babe--just--come on.

32:56.841 --> 33:00.143
I think being in love
takes a certain maturity.

33:00.177 --> 33:02.145
And I think I'm
getting to the point

33:02.179 --> 33:05.148
where this could
actually happen.

33:05.182 --> 33:07.067
<i> And I look forward to it</i>
<i> because</i>

33:07.110 --> 33:09.611
apparently, it's a really
warm, fuzzy feeling.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.780
- You ready?
- Filet mignon.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.657
Uh, red wine demi glace

33:13.691 --> 33:16.326
with a beetroot puree.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.745
Thank you.

33:18.788 --> 33:21.331
- Filet mignon,
beetroot puree.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.175
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

33:32.209 --> 33:33.468
- Okay, appreciate it.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.762
Thanks, love.

33:35.805 --> 33:36.880
- Here we are.
My pleasure.

33:36.889 --> 33:38.974
- Aw, in a heart.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.767
- Looks amazing.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.478
- Oh, my gosh,
this is so good.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.771
- Mmm.

33:48.985 --> 33:54.489
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

33:54.532 --> 33:56.033
<i> - I'm scared.</i>

33:56.067 --> 33:57.659
This could either be
really good or really bad.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.038
- I'd like to, uh,
make a little toast.

34:01.072 --> 34:04.041
- Aww.
- For everyone.

34:04.075 --> 34:05.375
First, today was, like,
one of the best,

34:05.409 --> 34:07.461
most memorable days of my life.

34:07.503 --> 34:09.212
I like to really just
soak it in and just know

34:09.246 --> 34:11.006
how fortunate I am.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.674
It's a lot of the little things,
like, I know

34:12.717 --> 34:14.551
I wake up in the morning

34:14.585 --> 34:16.386
and give my girlfriend a kiss.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.889
And I want to
keep those days going.

34:18.923 --> 34:20.682
Hopefully for
the rest of my life.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.642
With that being said,

34:22.685 --> 34:23.894
Rachel.

34:26.263 --> 34:27.272
Um...

34:30.234 --> 34:31.234
<i> - Coming up...</i>

34:31.268 --> 34:32.652
- You're a man.

34:32.695 --> 34:33.737
<i> You're a man.</i>
<i> - All right.</i>

34:33.771 --> 34:34.821
All right, ready?
Ready, champ?

34:34.864 --> 34:36.656
- Mm.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.366
Hello, Emily, how are you?
- Hello.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.541
- First, today was, like,
one of the best,

34:46.584 --> 34:48.210
most memorable days of my life.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.003
I want to keep those days going.

34:50.046 --> 34:52.881
So with--with that being said...

34:52.924 --> 34:53.882
- Oh, my God.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.220
- Rachel--
let me get on my right--

34:58.262 --> 35:00.388
- Yes.
- Will you marry me?

35:00.431 --> 35:03.725
- Yes.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.231
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

35:09.273 --> 35:12.109
- He's crying; she's crying.
- Aww.

35:12.143 --> 35:13.860
- The guests are crying.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.862
- Is this real?

35:15.905 --> 35:18.198
<i> - So cute.</i>

35:18.241 --> 35:20.408
Aww.
- It makes me so happy.

35:20.451 --> 35:23.245
- There's just so much
love in the air.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.622
This story is a story
they're gonna tell their

35:25.656 --> 35:27.124
friends when they get home,

35:27.158 --> 35:28.750
<i> their parents</i>
<i> when they get home.</i>

35:28.793 --> 35:30.919
<i> When their children ask</i>
<i> how he proposed,</i>

35:30.962 --> 35:32.546
<i> their grandchildren;</i>

35:32.588 --> 35:34.965
this day is gonna be
talked about for a long time.

35:34.999 --> 35:36.925
- Oh, my God,
I love you.

35:38.928 --> 35:41.012
- Yeah, don't worry about that.
- That's tomorrow--tomorrow.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.099
- Yeah?

36:00.858 --> 36:02.075
- That'll be fun.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.662
Let's go on a double date!

36:05.696 --> 36:07.497
<i> Dude, f--- yeah,</i>
<i> we can go fishing.</i>

36:07.531 --> 36:09.457
Have you ever been fishing?
It's so fun.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.669
I'm not nervous, I think,
if Kyle and I went by ourselves.

36:12.703 --> 36:15.130
<i> I just thought if Emily</i>
<i> and Kelley would come along,</i>

36:15.173 --> 36:17.007
it would take a little bit
of the, like,

36:17.041 --> 36:18.925
heaviness out of the vibe.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.177
Think about it, girl.

36:25.883 --> 36:27.017
- Crew?

36:27.051 --> 36:28.351
- Who is it?
- No one's here!

36:28.385 --> 36:29.603
No one's here.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.689
- What are you guys doing?

36:32.723 --> 36:34.858
We're watching the video.
- Just chilling.

36:34.892 --> 36:36.276
- You're coming?

36:36.319 --> 36:37.819
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

36:37.862 --> 36:39.863
- To be fair,
isn't that my choice?

36:39.897 --> 36:41.489
- Why?
- Since I was the that in--

36:41.532 --> 36:43.033
that's paying for the
f---ing thing, though.

36:43.067 --> 36:44.784
- Can't they come?
- Why don't you guys go?

36:44.827 --> 36:46.703
All three of you go,
have a f---ing triple date.

36:46.737 --> 36:49.289
Can't believe this sh--.
- I heard you guys wanted to go.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.999
- When?
- I got to go.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.542
- I think it'd be fun.

36:52.576 --> 36:54.211
- Why don't you all
go in her room, yeah?

36:54.245 --> 36:55.378
Have a double date in there.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.381
- I mean, I wouldn't mind
going fishing.

36:58.415 --> 37:00.383
- Yeah, I know.
- But it's your date.

37:00.417 --> 37:02.219
- Yeah, it's your date.
- That's what I'm thinking.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.893
- Why don't you do
something else on the same night

37:09.927 --> 37:12.229
and you could even fish together
and then do your own thing.

37:12.263 --> 37:14.022
- I don't know, we just have
a lot to do on the boat.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.400
<i> - So you're both</i>
<i> gonna go fishing?</i>

37:17.434 --> 37:19.361
It's a bit concerning that
you guys are just gonna go

37:19.403 --> 37:22.239
f--- off while me and Lauren
have to clean the boat.

37:22.273 --> 37:23.365
Uh, that's not really fair.

37:25.776 --> 37:27.702
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, guys.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.204
- Good night, Frank.

37:32.116 --> 37:33.375
- Oh, yeah, I got it.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.879
- Ooh.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.548
What my baby wants,
my baby gets.

37:41.959 --> 37:46.596
Oh, my God.
It's so cute.

37:46.630 --> 37:49.224
- Ooh.
- Ah.

37:51.802 --> 37:52.852
- Mm.
- I love you.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.521
<i> - I love you.</i>

37:58.642 --> 38:00.527
<i> - Things are starting</i>
<i> to feel a little weird.</i>

38:00.569 --> 38:02.779
<i> It makes me slightly</i>
<i> uncomfortable the way Kyle</i>

38:02.813 --> 38:04.948
<i> is so persistent.</i>

38:04.982 --> 38:07.117
I don't understand, like,
why it's expected

38:07.151 --> 38:10.203
that it's gonna be this, like,
full-blown romantic thing.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.623
- Jokes...

38:13.657 --> 38:15.250
- I'm sorry.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.543
- No, it's okay. It's fine.

38:16.585 --> 38:17.961
- No, no, no.
- I just think like

38:17.995 --> 38:19.963
the more the merrier.
- All right, okay.

38:19.997 --> 38:21.131
No, no, no, it's fine.
I'll think about it.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.803
- I totally think
it's really cool

38:26.837 --> 38:28.888
that they're going fishing
and everything,

38:28.931 --> 38:30.598
but, like, do it
on your own time.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.767
You know, if it is
all four of 'em gone, like,

38:32.810 --> 38:35.312
they shouldn't expect us...

38:35.346 --> 38:36.896
- To do, like, a full wash down.

38:36.939 --> 38:39.691
- To carry on
because they have plans.

38:41.185 --> 38:42.569
<i> Whatever.</i>

38:44.488 --> 38:46.323
- Shake some booty.
- What would your dwarf name be?

38:46.357 --> 38:49.659
There's Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc,
Happy, Grumpy,

38:49.693 --> 38:51.828
Bashful.
- Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy.

38:51.862 --> 38:54.164
It depends what mood I'm in.
Right now I'm sleepy.

38:54.198 --> 38:55.415
- Yeah.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.125
Grumpy, Bashful,
- Bashful, Grumpy.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.960
I'm a little bashful
right now, to be honest.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.837
- What?
- Well, because...

39:00.871 --> 39:02.797
- Emily?

39:02.840 --> 39:05.008
<i> - Well, yeah, I'm thinking</i>
<i>about taking her out to dinner.</i>

39:05.042 --> 39:07.677
- You're bashful around her?
That's a very good sign.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.972
- How you gonna do it?

39:11.015 --> 39:12.682
- I feel like
a young schoolgirl.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.604
- Aw, that's so romantic.
- I know.

39:17.646 --> 39:19.689
- You should just
use that on her.

39:19.723 --> 39:21.775
- "Hey, Emily, you make me
feel like a young schoolgirl."

39:21.817 --> 39:23.193
- Yeah.

39:23.227 --> 39:25.695
- I am a little nervous
about asking Emily out.

39:25.729 --> 39:28.198
It's been many years since
I have

39:28.232 --> 39:31.534
<i> asked an English rose</i>
<i> on a date.</i>

39:31.568 --> 39:33.995
Actually, I don't even think
I've ever done it before.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.039
So, yeah, nerve-wracking stuff.

39:36.073 --> 39:39.000
- Hey, by the way.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah?

39:42.546 --> 39:43.505
<i> - What?</i>

39:43.547 --> 39:45.507
- What are you, scared?

39:45.549 --> 39:48.009
- I just told you I was bashful;
was that not enough?

39:48.052 --> 39:50.220
- Don't overthink it.

39:50.254 --> 39:52.847
- Well, now you're scaring me.
I was gonna ask her anyway, and

39:52.890 --> 39:54.724
now you're pressurizing me to.
- No, I'm not.

39:54.758 --> 39:57.018
- Kate, I just need to
digest this one by myself.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.728
- Okay.
- But I appreciate it.

39:58.762 --> 40:00.230
- Okay.
- I really do, I appreciate it.

40:00.264 --> 40:01.231
- Good.
- Thank you.

40:01.265 --> 40:02.816
- Bye.

40:02.858 --> 40:04.984
- I'm not going to bed.
- I'm--going away.

40:05.027 --> 40:07.195
- Huh?

40:11.275 --> 40:13.034
<i> Kate?</i>
<i> - What?</i>

40:19.450 --> 40:22.919
- That whole
"if she says no" speech...

40:22.953 --> 40:24.421
<i> - I was just being sarcastic.</i>
<i> - That--no--that--</i>

40:24.455 --> 40:26.089
oh, that was great.

40:26.123 --> 40:27.590
- Take it outside, take it out.
- Because then maybe...

40:27.624 --> 40:30.093
- Take it outside.
- Well, because then maybe--

40:30.127 --> 40:31.511
<i> - You started it.</i>
<i> - Why would you do that</i>

40:31.554 --> 40:32.762
to anyone?
- Are you being sarcastic

40:32.796 --> 40:34.556
right now?
- No, I'm being--

40:34.598 --> 40:37.267
- You used to be--
- I'm actually--I'm curious.

40:37.301 --> 40:39.394
- You actually--
- Yell it; just yell it.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.895
- She knows she's gonna go.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.397
It's always--it's always
going to happen...

40:42.440 --> 40:45.066
- How does she know--
she's gonna go?

40:45.109 --> 40:46.943
- She know--
'cause she likes you.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.280
<i> - Just look at her, she's--</i>
<i> she's like--in there--</i>

40:50.314 --> 40:51.781
she's in there
like Cinderella, like,

40:51.815 --> 40:53.616
¶ One day my prince
will come ¶

40:53.650 --> 40:55.034
<i> - All right, fine.</i>
<i> - Do some jumping jacks.</i>

40:55.077 --> 40:57.078
Get the adrenaline going.
You're a man.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.246
You're a man.
You're a hot man.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.123
You're a hot man.
- Ahh...

41:00.157 --> 41:01.291
- You got this.

41:01.325 --> 41:02.459
Yeah.
- All right.

41:02.493 --> 41:03.751
- All right, ready?
Ready, champ?

41:03.794 --> 41:05.920
Ready, champ?
- Yeah, all right.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.464
- Go get 'em, tiger.
- So what do I do?

41:07.498 --> 41:09.466
- You say, "Hey, Em."
- Tell me what--

41:09.500 --> 41:11.926
What do I do?
What do I do?

41:11.969 --> 41:14.304
<i> - All right, you're like...</i>
<i> - Are you coming with me?</i>

41:14.338 --> 41:15.555
<i> - No.</i>

41:15.598 --> 41:17.307
I've never seen
Ben this way

41:17.341 --> 41:18.558
around any girl.

41:23.013 --> 41:24.105
- Hello, Emily, how are you?

41:24.148 --> 41:25.482
- Hello.
I'm good.

41:25.516 --> 41:26.733
- Good.

41:26.775 --> 41:28.568
I would like to take you
for dinner.

41:28.611 --> 41:30.570
Would that be okay?

41:30.613 --> 41:32.989
- What's she saying?

41:33.023 --> 41:34.616
- Where did this come from?

41:34.658 --> 41:37.619
- I--I don't know,
I just thought of it, and, like.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.996
- That'd be lovely.
- Really?

41:40.030 --> 41:41.956
- I'd love to.
- That's very good.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.500
- Is it a giggle?
- He's a bit flustered.

41:43.534 --> 41:44.667
- He does.

41:44.701 --> 41:46.294
- See you in the morning
and then

41:46.337 --> 41:48.254
probably in the afternoon
and then...

41:48.297 --> 41:50.590
And then probably at dinner.

41:50.633 --> 41:52.300
I mean, definitely at dinner.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.135
That--that's the definite
time I'll see you.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.471
- Yes.
- Okay, well, perfect.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.139
- Okay, cool.
- Thank you.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.225
- Oh, he's coming,
he's coming, he's coming.

42:02.719 --> 42:04.145
- What happened?
- Oh--what--you did well.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.688
- Are you trying to
make her jealous now?

42:05.722 --> 42:07.190
- No, I'm not.
That's why I want you over here.

42:07.224 --> 42:08.608
- Why, why, why?

42:08.651 --> 42:10.360
- Because you forced me
to do that one.

42:10.394 --> 42:12.195
- Oh, so she said yes?
- She wants to go, yeah.

42:12.229 --> 42:14.989
- Aw! Yee!
- She does, yeah, she does.

42:15.032 --> 42:16.032
- I could tell.

42:16.066 --> 42:17.867
Normally, Ben would be like

42:17.901 --> 42:19.661
so proud of himself.

42:19.703 --> 42:22.372
But actually he seems
more nervous than proud.

42:22.406 --> 42:23.873
And it's really cute.

42:23.907 --> 42:25.667
You are so cute.

42:28.245 --> 42:29.879
<i> - Next on "Below Deck"...</i>

42:29.913 --> 42:32.549
- Miss Emily, she has got
the cabin love fever.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.968
- I'm going to dinner
with, um, Ben.

42:35.010 --> 42:37.345
- Yeah, girl,
you little cheeky sod.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.889
<i> Kelley is gonna flip.</i>

42:39.923 --> 42:42.475
- You have to give Kyle
a chance.

42:42.518 --> 42:45.353
He is real-life,
British Ryan Gosling.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.313
<i> - I felt like</i>
<i> I'm on a date with a girl</i>

42:47.356 --> 42:50.149
<i> and she's giving interest</i>
<i> back home while I am with her.</i>

42:50.192 --> 42:52.402
And it f---ing hurt me.

42:52.436 --> 42:53.861
<i> - Ben?</i>
<i> - He's right here.</i>

42:53.904 --> 42:55.905
- Your lady is waiting
in the main salon.

42:55.939 --> 42:57.156
- Oh.
- Your lady?

42:57.199 --> 42:58.408
What lady?

42:58.442 --> 42:59.742
- Emily.
They're going on a date.

42:59.776 --> 43:01.035
- Oh.

43:01.078 --> 43:02.078
- Cheers, Emily.
- Cheers.

43:02.112 --> 43:03.705
- To Kelley--
not being here.

43:03.747 --> 43:05.248
- Are you upset at me?
- No.

43:05.282 --> 43:06.749
I just don't want
you playing with Kyle.

43:06.783 --> 43:07.875
You did not tell him the truth.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.586
- You shouldn't be judging me.

43:09.620 --> 43:11.379
Kelley, I'm not done
talking to you.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.423
