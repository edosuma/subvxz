PLAYING)

00:41.842 --> 00:43.111
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Perfect.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.312
Welcome, Robin.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.089
No!

01:00.861 --> 01:02.696
Alright, where is it?

01:02.730 --> 01:03.831
Which one of you took it?

01:03.864 --> 01:05.799
-Tell me now.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.735
Dude, what are you
talking about?

01:07.768 --> 01:10.838
-Uh.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.140
I do not know.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.841
And I do not care.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.877
Yeah, bro.
I know you're serious about
your legendary sandwiches,

01:16.910 --> 01:18.379
but come on!

01:18.412 --> 01:21.249
It wasn't just legendary,
it was perfect.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.218
For years,
I've worked to improve
my sandwich making skills.

01:24.252 --> 01:27.855
I traveled the world
to learn masters
of sandwich construction.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.097
Ah!

02:06.927 --> 02:08.596
ROBIN: But I wasn't satisfied.

02:08.629 --> 02:12.900
Every bite I took was
haunted by the knowledge
that I could do better.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.369
Until one night,
it came to me.

02:15.403 --> 02:18.339
The perfect sandwich.

02:18.372 --> 02:21.209
After three days
of work in the lab, I had it.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.345
Perfection on two
slices of bread,
which were also perfect.

02:24.378 --> 02:28.449
All that was left
was to crisp it
in the refrigerator.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.784
However, when I returned,

02:30.818 --> 02:32.920
it was gone.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.956
Well, that's the longest
story about making a sandwich
I ever had to sit through.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.927
Nobody's leaving
this room until I get
to the bottom of this.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.962
-Uh, bye.
-We're out.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.531
Do not worry, Robin.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.500
I am sure you will
find your missing lunch meal.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.302
Oh, I will.

02:52.706 --> 02:53.574
What?

02:53.607 --> 02:56.277
Hey, are you hacking
into my data logs?

02:56.310 --> 02:58.412
-This is an invasion
of privacy.

02:58.446 --> 02:59.947
Sounds like you have
something to hide.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.651
Now, let's see where
you really were when
my sandwich was stolen.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.962
Ooh-hoo!

03:14.995 --> 03:16.964
Mm. Mm!

03:16.997 --> 03:18.299
Are these padded?

03:18.332 --> 03:20.501
My butt looks so good
in these tights.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.305
Looks like you have an alibi.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.639
Do we need to talk?

03:31.011 --> 03:32.413
STARFIRE: Hello.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.816
Robin, is that you?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.951
ROBIN: Yes.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.888
You are hooked up
to my patent pending
lie detector machine.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.490
So I'll know if you're lying.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.793
Now, did you
steal my sandwich?

03:45.826 --> 03:47.761
I did not.
I was doing the handstands.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.763
And before that I had
the toasts from France
for breakfast.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.899
And before that I was
asleep and before that
I read the book.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.834
And before that I brushed
each of my tooths.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.370
Yeah, okay, okay.
I've heard enough.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.339
One last question.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.573
Do you love me?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.510
Yes.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.745
Did you just lie to me?

04:04.778 --> 04:05.613
Yes.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.848
I did not wish
to hurt the feelings.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.385
I see.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.522
Could you learn to love me?

04:14.555 --> 04:16.890
-No.
-Very well.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.859
-Is there any
circumstance where...
-No.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.728
-Thank you for your time.

04:22.830 --> 04:23.864
Are you sure?

04:24.965 --> 04:27.034
Do not eat that taco.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.269
You'll contaminate
a possible crime scene.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.307
Crime scene?
What are you talking
about, dude?

04:33.341 --> 04:34.542
Inside you're tummy.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.710
I didn't eat
your sandwich, dude.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.779
I'm a vegetarian.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.581
Or are you?

04:40.614 --> 04:43.016
Raven, transport me
into Beast Boy's stomach.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.353
-Okay.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.423
Aw, maybe I should
have shrunk him first.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.695
No sign of the sandwich
in there.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.797
Dude, come on!

04:56.830 --> 04:59.467
Going inside Beast Boy,
injecting Starfire,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.469
hacking my very
sensitive files.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.770
I don't even know
what you did to Raven.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.972
-He asked, I said no.

05:05.005 --> 05:09.076
You must release
yourself of this sandwich
obsession, Robin.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.044
Let it go, dude.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.782
No way! Never letting things
go is what makes me
a good crime fighter.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.350
Oh, come on, man.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.018
You gotta let some things go.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.121
Like what are you
going to do when Starfire
marries some dude?

05:21.154 --> 05:23.924
Plans have been made.
Now, let's see.

05:23.957 --> 05:27.395
The thief was smart,
agile, well-trained.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.430
So that eliminates
all of you.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.131
I got it!

05:31.164 --> 05:33.100
It's so obvious.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.837
There's only one person
that could have gotten
past my defenses.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.439
-Me!

05:38.472 --> 05:40.040
You ate of the sandwich?

05:40.073 --> 05:42.109
Not me now, future me.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.844
It's so clear.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.514
I never got over
the taste of that
perfect sandwich.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.981
I was so haunted by it

05:48.015 --> 05:50.518
that I traveled back in time
to eat it again

05:50.551 --> 05:52.152
before I ever ate it
in the first place.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.087
Robin has left the tower.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.557
Seriously, man, let it go.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.759
Never!
To the time machine!

06:03.897 --> 06:05.699
BEAST BOY:
Where'd you get
a time machine?

06:09.837 --> 06:10.871
ROBIN: There I am.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.406
Let's get me.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.810
-Nah, we're just
gonna hang here.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.548
Honey, I'm home.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.784
I'm just kidding.
I live alone.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.189
Where is it?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.724
Whoa, young me.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.693
-Don't play dumb.

06:32.726 --> 06:37.030
Just remember.
Anything I do to my body now
affects yours in the future.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.466
Now talk.

06:38.799 --> 06:39.633
Huh?

06:39.667 --> 06:42.436
Okay, then we'll do it
the hard way.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.604
Aw! Ugh!

06:43.637 --> 06:45.773
You feel that,
future self?

06:45.806 --> 06:48.642
Uh, I guess
I remember it hurting.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.811
Oh yeah?
How about this?

06:54.214 --> 06:55.749
How about that?

06:55.783 --> 06:58.486
Oh, yeah.
That totally stung.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.787
Robin, stop!

06:59.820 --> 07:02.723
You are injuring yourself
over the sandwich.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.759
Oh, the perfect sandwich.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.828
That's what this is all about.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.230
Yeah, I was super
bummed when that vanished.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.965
But you learn
to let things go.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.501
Now, I know you're lying.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.536
I would never
let anything go.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.971
Besides, I don't need
your confession.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.207
You're me and I know me.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.543
There's only one place
I'd put it.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.778
The sandwich
is in your refrigerator.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.581
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
Let's not go crazy here.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.085
See, no sandwich.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.987
Just sadness.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.989
No! That's impossible.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.659
So long, weirdo.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.062
Ah! It is nice
to have visitors.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.098
Man, I'm bored.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.867
Argh, I know.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.503
Oh, lets prank call
our future selves.

07:49.537 --> 07:50.738
Yeah.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.580
I was wondering
if your refrigerator
is running.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.249
Then you better catch it.
Booyah!

08:05.586 --> 08:06.854
My turn, my turn, my turn!

08:09.189 --> 08:10.691
Hi.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.193
Is Beast Boy there?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.264
How?

08:17.297 --> 08:18.632
Really?

08:18.666 --> 08:21.802
Well, um,
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.504
Dude, are you okay?

08:25.906 --> 08:27.708
That was a bad idea.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.744
We still on
the sandwich thing?

08:30.778 --> 08:32.212
-Yeah.
-I got it!

08:32.245 --> 08:35.683
Old me did steal the sandwich,
but then the sandwich...

08:35.716 --> 08:37.150
Grew legs and walked away?

08:37.184 --> 08:40.153
Legs? No, stay with me,
Cyborg that's ridiculous.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.722
It floated away.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.091
Of course it did, Robin.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.293
We should call the doctor.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.695
To the teleporter.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.063
We don't have a teleporter.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.702
Oh, where are we now?

08:54.735 --> 08:56.904
I made that sandwich,
uh, a little too perfect.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.707
So perfect that when old me
didn't eat it immediately,

08:59.740 --> 09:01.441
it evolved into
a super-intelligence

09:01.474 --> 09:04.111
and traveled into space
to learn about the nature
of the universe.

09:04.144 --> 09:08.716
Robin, perhaps it is time
to simply let it go.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.084
Let it go.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.152
Never!

09:12.185 --> 09:14.788
ROBIN:
Sandwich, where are you?

09:14.822 --> 09:16.824
I am sorry your sandwich
went missing,

09:16.857 --> 09:19.292
but it's definitely not here
on some alien planet...

09:23.664 --> 09:25.332
Welcome, travelers.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.335
It is I, the perfect sandwich.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.370
After Future Robin
stole me,

09:30.403 --> 09:32.673
I escaped from his
one-bedroom apartment

09:32.706 --> 09:35.242
and came here
to ponder the universe.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.745
Huh, I told you.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.713
And through meditation,

09:39.747 --> 09:42.650
I have realized
life's greatest secret.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.185
Oh, tell us please.

09:45.218 --> 09:48.689
That the sandwich
is the supreme form of life

09:48.722 --> 09:51.358
and all others
must be destroyed.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.626
Goodbye.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.731
Titans, go!

10:08.241 --> 10:10.210
Oh!

10:14.715 --> 10:16.149
Ahhh! Ahhh!

10:18.986 --> 10:19.853
Ahhh!

10:21.254 --> 10:23.791
Nothing can destroy
the perfect sandwich.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.026
Nothing except the mouth
of its creator.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.696
-For you to say it.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.163
Say what?

10:30.197 --> 10:32.666
That I was right.
You should never
let things go.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.735
-Fine, in some situations...
-Nope, never.

10:34.768 --> 10:39.106
You were right, Robin,
and you should never
let the things go.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.140
Thank you.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.088
Perfect.
