02:48.294 --> 02:50.505
- Master Holbein!
- My Lord.

02:50.505 --> 02:52.841
I have... I've a commission for you.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.552
The Duke of Cleves has given you permission

02:55.552 --> 02:57.929
to paint his daughter, Anne.
You should leave at once.

02:57.929 --> 02:59.639
There are so many more pressing things

02:59.639 --> 03:01.349
and you two have time to talk
about a painting?

03:01.349 --> 03:03.351
This is no ordinary painting,
master Holbein,

03:03.351 --> 03:05.311
A great many things hang upon it.

03:05.311 --> 03:08.481
To that effect, however
you should find the lady,

03:08.523 --> 03:10.441
whatever her actual appearance,

03:10.441 --> 03:14.362
I pray you use your art and give her
at least a pleasing countent

03:14.362 --> 03:16.906
Even if she is as ugly as sin?

03:16.906 --> 03:19.534
I truly hope she is not so.

03:19.534 --> 03:23.663
But still, you wish me,
if necessary to lie?

03:23.955 --> 03:28.501
Surely, all art is a lie,
master Holbein.

03:34.215 --> 03:37.385
My Lords, since the signing
of the Treaty of Toledo

03:37.385 --> 03:39.345
Between the French king
and the Emperor

03:39.637 --> 03:42.265
There have been vital and unavoidable signs
of their mutual preparations for war

03:42.265 --> 03:44.934
Against this realm.

03:46.144 --> 03:49.189
You know in this how much they
have been urged on by the Vicar of Rome

03:49.189 --> 03:51.357
and now we hear competent
reports of fleets

03:51.357 --> 03:53.526
Gathering at Antwerp and Bologna.

03:53.568 --> 03:55.778
And of an army of the Netherlands.

03:55.778 --> 03:58.198
Furthermore, the French and Imperial
ambassadors

03:58.198 --> 04:00.617
Have been recalled by their masters.

04:01.034 --> 04:05.788
My Lords, we have not been idle
under such provocations

04:05.830 --> 04:07.916
Defence forces have been mastered

04:07.916 --> 04:10.001
and beacon set along the coast for warning.

04:10.168 --> 04:12.045
Work has also begun building

04:12.045 --> 04:13.922
artillery forts facing the English Channel.

04:13.922 --> 04:17.341
In the North, we have strengthen
our borders against the Scots.

04:17.341 --> 04:20.595
And His Majesty's fleet warships
has been provisioned.

04:20.637 --> 04:22.514
Foreign vessels are being forbidden
to leave these shores

04:22.514 --> 04:24.432
without Royal permission.

04:29.979 --> 04:31.022
My Lords.

04:32.023 --> 04:36.486
How can anyone doubt that the
Pope, that pestilent idol,

04:36.694 --> 04:39.948
that enemy of truth, the usurper of all princes,

04:39.989 --> 04:42.283
is now conspiring to corrupt  England's religion

04:42.283 --> 04:44.619
and strip her of her wealth.

04:47.622 --> 04:51.876
My Lords, at such a time, it is good
for me to be amongst my people.

04:52.794 --> 04:54.879
I will visit all the places where the barricades

04:54.879 --> 04:56.965
and the defences of the realm are being built

04:57.799 --> 04:59.801
for the encouragement of my troops.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.512
And to the terror of my enemies.

05:03.596 --> 05:07.725
- My Lords.
- Your Majesty.

05:15.984 --> 05:18.403
It seems we are threatened
from everywhere, Sir Francis.

05:18.403 --> 05:20.488
Scotland, Spain, the Low Countries.

05:21.114 --> 05:24.200
We are like a morsel among these choppers.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.702
I'll tell you something else, Tom.

05:25.702 --> 05:27.036
According to Cromwell's agents,

05:27.036 --> 05:30.415
Just two weeks ago, Cardinal Pole
left Rome in a secret mission.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.083
Shall we be after him again?

05:32.125 --> 05:35.211
As soon as we have more news
of his whereabouts, we shall.

05:35.461 --> 05:38.173
Sharpen your knives.

05:41.843 --> 05:44.095
- Your Grace.
- My Lord.

05:44.095 --> 05:47.599
- Can we talk? In private?
- Sometime, my Lord. Not now.

05:52.687 --> 05:57.775
Mr. Holbein has sent this portrait
of Anne de Cleves, your Majesty.

05:59.319 --> 06:01.446
She is pleasing.

06:02.906 --> 06:05.158
Has our ambassador been able to see her properly?

06:05.200 --> 06:07.327
Yes, your Majesty, Sir John has written to me
in great praise

06:07.327 --> 06:09.495
of the princesses person.

06:09.495 --> 06:13.666
He writes, "she's incomparable and excels
the Duchess of Milan

06:13.666 --> 06:16.419
as the golden sun excels the silver moon".

06:20.048 --> 06:23.718
Majesty, if I may.

06:25.178 --> 06:28.473
Marriage to the Duchess of Milan
is no longer an option.

06:28.932 --> 06:30.683
Nor since the Emperor
and the French

06:30.683 --> 06:32.477
are in league against us.

06:32.477 --> 06:34.437
Or any of the French women.

06:35.688 --> 06:39.025
Your Majesty is beset by enemies.

06:39.692 --> 06:42.737
Marriage to Anne of Cleves
would bring with it the military

06:42.737 --> 06:46.115
and financial support of the Protestant League.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.653
- What?
What is it?

07:23.695 --> 07:26.489
Enemy ships, flying the Black Eagle.

07:27.115 --> 07:29.242
Give it a look.

07:34.414 --> 07:36.291
It's appeared on the ships.

07:36.332 --> 07:38.710
For Lord's sake! Light the beacon!

07:41.087 --> 07:43.464
Hurry!

07:44.215 --> 07:47.093
Light it!

07:56.227 --> 07:58.271
God save us!

07:58.855 --> 08:01.941
Swan Castle
Cleves, Germany

08:02.066 --> 08:04.903
Duke William, his Majesty is much taken
by the portrait of your sister, Anne.

08:04.944 --> 08:07.447
He encourages you to send ambassadors

08:07.447 --> 08:09.949
to England to conclude
the negociations

08:09.991 --> 08:14.329
including the question of your
sister's dowry and so on.

08:15.079 --> 08:18.583
Once again, his Majesty is premature.

08:20.084 --> 08:22.587
But surely, your highness...

08:22.629 --> 08:25.798
I think the king should come to me
publicly

08:25.798 --> 08:29.636
And on bended knee
to beg for my sister's hand.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.388
And for the protection of the League.

08:32.931 --> 08:35.767
In any case, Anne was already promised,
formerly

08:35.767 --> 08:38.602
to the Duke of Lorraine's son.

08:38.895 --> 08:42.524
And I do not see how I can break
that promise or keep my honor.

08:42.524 --> 08:45.276
Your highness, if true, this is
most unexpected

08:45.276 --> 08:48.029
and unwelcome news.

08:48.029 --> 08:50.240
That is because you expected from the start

08:50.240 --> 08:52.450
to have your way with Cleves and my sister.

08:52.992 --> 08:56.454
But my country is not a brothel
and my sister is not a whore.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.332
Well...

09:05.713 --> 09:09.551
If your master truly desires
to have an alliance,

09:09.551 --> 09:13.012
then he must demonstrate his respect
for my country...

09:13.638 --> 09:17.767
and put a better price
on my sister's virginity.

09:22.230 --> 09:25.900
Make way!

09:25.942 --> 09:27.569
Make way!

09:28.236 --> 09:29.904
Thank you, sir.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.283
Come on.

09:38.246 --> 09:40.623
Message for His Majesty!

09:43.668 --> 09:45.461
Majesty.

09:51.968 --> 09:54.512
From Sir Thomas Chaining,
warden of the Sank Ports.

09:54.554 --> 10:00.185
Your Majesty, Lords of the Council, this morning
we counted 68 Imperial ships in the Channel.

10:01.227 --> 10:03.188
I sent out two ships and afterwards my bowmen

10:03.188 --> 10:05.148
were taken aboard the Imperial flagship

10:05.148 --> 10:07.442
and shown every courtesy by the Admiral.

10:07.483 --> 10:11.613
He said his fleet was bound
for Spain, and not England.

10:12.614 --> 10:15.783
That he meant no harm to either us
or our coast.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.785
If they doubt this word,
they ought to see

10:17.785 --> 10:19.829
How poorly armed the ships were.

10:19.829 --> 10:21.915
Quick more like merchantmen,

10:21.956 --> 10:25.585
That hold both the provisions for
Emperor's voyage to Constantinople.

10:41.935 --> 10:44.687
The Imperial ambassador,
your majesty.

10:47.357 --> 10:49.025
I thought you'd been recalled.

10:49.067 --> 10:51.486
There was some talk, your majesty.

10:51.528 --> 10:53.613
But I had no desire to leave here,

10:53.613 --> 10:55.657
Not that I think there was any cause.

10:56.074 --> 10:58.326
Of course.

10:58.326 --> 11:01.746
But your master and the French king
have formed an alliance against me.

11:02.163 --> 11:04.874
There appears to have been preparations
for an invasion

11:04.874 --> 11:07.627
encouraged by the Vicar of Rome.

11:07.627 --> 11:10.463
Your Majesty, I've been in this job
for a long time,

11:10.463 --> 11:13.675
I know when to believe what I am told,
and when not to.

11:13.675 --> 11:15.969
Which is most of the time.

11:17.971 --> 11:21.182
Although the Emperor publicly embraced
the French king,

11:21.224 --> 11:24.394
And even gave him the Order of the Golden Fleece
from around his neck,

11:24.769 --> 11:27.772
He still continues to hate him.

11:27.814 --> 11:31.150
More than any other enemy,
my master fears the Turks.

11:31.484 --> 11:33.862
And yet the French are in league with them.

11:35.154 --> 11:36.990
How is such behavior from another
Christian Monarch

11:36.990 --> 11:38.825
to be forgiven?

11:39.492 --> 11:42.662
- Then they are no longer in the alliance?
- No.

11:42.662 --> 11:45.248
The accord has already broken down.

11:46.374 --> 11:48.793
Which means that the Duchess of Milan is

11:48.793 --> 11:51.171
once more available for your
Majesties bed.

11:52.630 --> 11:55.717
It's to late, Mr. Chapuys.

11:55.717 --> 11:58.011
Mr. Chapuys, tell me,
am I to be relived

11:58.011 --> 12:00.346
that once more, I've been used
as a pawn in a game

12:00.346 --> 12:02.599
between your master and the French King?

12:05.435 --> 12:07.854
I tell you this here and now,

12:08.229 --> 12:11.608
I've had enough, Mr. Chapuys.

12:12.192 --> 12:14.861
I've had enough.

12:17.363 --> 12:19.657
You may leave.

12:39.969 --> 12:42.597
I'm surprised to see you back
so soon, Excellences.

12:42.639 --> 12:45.808
We have good news, your Highness.

12:45.850 --> 12:46.893
How so?

12:46.893 --> 12:50.605
His Majesty so desires
to marry your sister, Anne,

12:50.605 --> 12:53.983
That he is willing to forfeit
the requirements of a dowry.

12:57.153 --> 12:58.363
He wants nothing?

12:58.404 --> 13:02.951
Only his new bride, in the
shorter time as possible.

13:02.951 --> 13:07.622
His Majesty will also pay your Highness

13:07.664 --> 13:13.127
a considerable stipend for introducing
him to the League.

13:13.169 --> 13:16.130
However, we recall that your sister

13:16.130 --> 13:19.133
is already promised to the
son of the Duke of Lorraine.

13:19.926 --> 13:23.555
Yes, that was indeed a great obstacle.

13:25.098 --> 13:28.017
However, on closer consideration
we have discovered that

13:28.017 --> 13:30.979
the contract was never ratified.

13:31.604 --> 13:35.900
And so is not binding in law or any other way.

13:37.110 --> 13:39.946
So your sister is free to marry the king?

13:41.030 --> 13:45.577
I will send my ambassadors to England
to conclude the negociations.

13:47.579 --> 13:50.331
Thank you gentlemen.

14:14.814 --> 14:16.482
What's this?

14:17.192 --> 14:21.279
Cromwell's agents, finally intercepted a letter
from Cardinal Pole.

14:21.279 --> 14:23.198
He was on his way to Rome.

14:23.239 --> 14:25.575
I have managed to decode it.

14:25.909 --> 14:28.244
May I see?

14:32.248 --> 14:34.626
To Cardinal Von Waldburg.

14:34.626 --> 14:37.378
Supposed to travel to Paris, to meet King Francis.

14:37.420 --> 14:42.008
Have already written, telling him I found
the Emperor very sympathetic to my mission.

14:42.592 --> 14:45.178
But fear it is not so.

14:45.178 --> 14:46.930
The Emperor fears the Turk
more than king Henry,

14:46.930 --> 14:50.225
so I believe he will not act
against him.

14:50.892 --> 14:53.645
So, postpone journey.

14:55.271 --> 14:59.025
Will go instead to papal city
of Carpentras.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.487
I wait further instructions
from his Holiness.

15:03.029 --> 15:05.073
Have you ever been to Carpentras?

15:06.074 --> 15:10.286
No, but I'm dying to go.

15:14.457 --> 15:16.334
The Duke of Sufolk, My Lord.

15:17.293 --> 15:19.045
Your Grace.

15:19.087 --> 15:21.130
To what do I owe this honor?

15:21.130 --> 15:22.549
I'm here to congratulate you.

15:22.590 --> 15:24.884
I understand the king has made you
Earl of Hartford.

15:25.760 --> 15:30.557
And I believe it is time to patch up
our past quarrels and difficulties.

15:30.557 --> 15:32.934
We have better quarrels to be added.

15:34.769 --> 15:37.063
I am happy to agree with your grace.

15:38.273 --> 15:40.525
- Drink?
- Please.

15:45.405 --> 15:47.407
Please.

15:53.163 --> 15:56.166
I am commanded to meet
the Princess at Calais.

15:57.041 --> 16:00.044
Great, many things hang up on
this marriage, do they not?

16:01.379 --> 16:03.548
The King's happiness, for one.

16:04.507 --> 16:08.052
And my Lord Cromwell's reputation.

16:10.013 --> 16:14.350
What a pity if all should go awry.

16:15.602 --> 16:18.354
I would have pity for the King.

16:18.855 --> 16:21.107
But on the other hand?

16:25.111 --> 16:28.031
- Salut!
- Salut!

16:29.365 --> 16:32.285
So, he is marrying a Lutheran heretic?

16:32.619 --> 16:33.953
So it seems.

16:33.953 --> 16:35.997
And I shall marry no one?!

16:35.997 --> 16:39.584
- My lady... I...
- No, I prefer it.

16:40.210 --> 16:43.421
Do you suppose I'd like to be
married off to the Dukes brother,

16:43.421 --> 16:45.715
or some heretic cousin of his?

16:46.090 --> 16:48.384
I would prefer to live in a nunnery.

16:51.221 --> 16:53.348
Like, you don't know what to think of the King,

16:53.348 --> 16:56.434
He burns one Lucifer,
and then marries another?

16:58.228 --> 17:03.816
Well, if God so wills it,
she might drown at sea.

17:09.531 --> 17:14.117
Chequers, Calais
English Occupied France.

17:28.675 --> 17:33.847
Gentlemen, we bid you welcome to Calais
on this most auspicious occasion.

17:33.847 --> 17:35.765
"Danke."

17:37.141 --> 17:40.937
May I present to you, His
Grace, the Duke of Suffolk.

17:40.979 --> 17:43.439
Your Grace, I'm honored.

17:45.149 --> 17:47.360
I am Herr Hoghesten,

17:47.694 --> 17:50.780
and this is Count Olisleger.

17:50.822 --> 17:52.407
"Hallo!"

17:53.199 --> 17:57.787
And here, is she, Her Highness Princess Anne.

17:57.787 --> 18:00.748
After a long time, my God!

18:41.206 --> 18:42.916
Your Highness.

18:45.627 --> 18:48.254
Good day, your Grace.

18:48.838 --> 18:52.592
I'm afraid the bad weather will prevent
our sailing for a few days.

18:53.134 --> 18:55.720
I understand.

19:02.185 --> 19:03.436
Perhaps your Grace could...

19:04.938 --> 19:08.358
help me to explain how the English are eating?

19:09.734 --> 19:11.694
Of course.

19:11.736 --> 19:16.950
And maybe... show me some things
the king likes to do?

19:21.246 --> 19:25.291
His Majesty likes to play cards
and gamble.

19:25.333 --> 19:28.044
- Do you play?
- No.

19:28.044 --> 19:32.257
I think, only the men play the cards
in my country.

19:33.466 --> 19:37.136
And, is it not bad to gamble?

19:37.428 --> 19:38.805
Only if you can afford to lose.

19:38.847 --> 19:40.974
We'll play Piquet, it's not hard to learn.

19:41.224 --> 19:43.393
Das ist gut. [This is ok.]

19:43.643 --> 19:47.730
There are 4 suits of cards.

19:47.939 --> 19:53.486
Spades, clubs, diamonds and hearts.

19:53.486 --> 19:57.282
Hearts? You play with hearts?

19:59.409 --> 20:01.452
Sometimes.

20:01.870 --> 20:07.792
And here we have aces, kings, queens and knaves.

20:08.501 --> 20:11.337
Then all the Court is here, ja?

20:17.051 --> 20:19.846
Does the king always win?

20:22.640 --> 20:25.393
His Majesty does not like losing.

20:34.694 --> 20:37.155
What have they told you about the king?

20:38.156 --> 20:41.910
Why? What is it I should know?

20:48.708 --> 20:52.837
Carpentras
Papal Enclave of Venaissin

20:53.713 --> 20:55.340
You are Francis Bryan?

20:55.340 --> 20:56.466
You can take us to the Cardinal?

20:56.466 --> 21:00.470
Si. Yes. Come quickly. He is with us.

21:19.572 --> 21:21.699
Where is the bastard?

21:39.008 --> 21:40.760
Sorry senor.

21:41.678 --> 21:46.516
Prego, go with God my sons.

21:53.690 --> 21:55.650
We'll never catch him.

21:56.776 --> 21:59.070
It's a waste of time.

21:59.654 --> 22:02.156
Perhaps not.

22:35.315 --> 22:37.483
Amen.

22:44.157 --> 22:46.618
- You didn't see her face?
- No Your Majesty.

22:46.618 --> 22:49.496
But she plays cards as pleasantly

22:49.496 --> 22:52.165
and with as good a grace
as any other noble woman.

22:52.540 --> 22:54.584
She's come to Rochester.

22:54.584 --> 22:57.003
I'm due to meet her in three days time.

22:58.129 --> 23:00.924
I tell you I'm more impatient
than ever to see her.

23:03.176 --> 23:05.470
What of Sir Francis Bryan?

23:05.470 --> 23:07.972
He and Sir Thomas Seymour are now
to Carpentras.

23:07.972 --> 23:10.975
Where Cardinal Pole is supposed to be hiding.

23:12.101 --> 23:15.355
It appears he has grown fearful
of assassination.

23:15.355 --> 23:17.440
He's every right to be so.

23:17.482 --> 23:21.027
I swear that man should be flamed alive
and I should wear his skin as a shirt.

23:21.903 --> 23:26.366
He will doom the day he allowed the Pope
to use and to threaten me.

23:28.243 --> 23:31.037
I tell you, I cannot abide this waiting.

23:33.456 --> 23:35.834
It's been a long time.

23:36.626 --> 23:39.212
I need to nourish love.

23:39.212 --> 23:41.923
- I can understand.
- Can you?

23:44.551 --> 23:47.136
I want to possess this woman

23:47.971 --> 23:50.723
And I haven't even seen her.

23:50.723 --> 23:54.143
She's a complete stranger to me.

23:58.273 --> 24:00.984
What if I can't?

24:03.611 --> 24:06.823
What if you can't... what?

24:07.240 --> 24:09.701
Broom.

24:10.034 --> 24:11.536
- Majesty.
- Fetch the master of the horse,

24:11.536 --> 24:13.997
I live for Rochester immediately.
Go!

24:49.908 --> 24:52.035
Make way!

25:00.877 --> 25:02.712
Dismount!

25:03.463 --> 25:08.092
Tell the lady a gentleman has come
to see her, bearing a New Year's gift.

25:55.348 --> 25:57.517
Madame.

26:19.622 --> 26:22.333
I'm here to welcome you
to my realm.

26:23.334 --> 26:25.962
I trust you are comfortable here?

26:27.338 --> 26:32.218
Before your journey to London.

26:34.804 --> 26:37.891
Thank you, Your Majesty.

26:46.774 --> 26:49.527
I'll see you in London.

27:05.835 --> 27:10.465
I should have taken more
lessons from the Duke.

27:11.132 --> 27:15.345
English manners are very
different from ours.

27:30.193 --> 27:33.196
I like her not!
Do you understand me?

27:34.113 --> 27:35.865
I like her not!

27:35.865 --> 27:37.700
Call a meeting of the Council.

27:42.247 --> 27:46.251
It seems, that Princes in marriage
suffer more then poor men.

27:46.918 --> 27:48.878
Since they have to take what
is brought to them,

27:49.087 --> 27:52.382
while poor man are at liberty to choose.

27:52.757 --> 27:55.969
I have been deceived about Anne of Cleves.

27:56.678 --> 28:00.598
She is nothing like what was reported to me.
Nothing!

28:01.307 --> 28:02.934
She looks like a horse!

28:03.142 --> 28:05.311
A furless mare!

28:11.150 --> 28:16.030
Your Majesty will remember that it was
Sir John who described her as being like a...

28:16.030 --> 28:19.159
I never saw her properly, which was not my fault.

28:19.159 --> 28:21.244
I carried out my commission as best I could,

28:21.286 --> 28:24.289
and I told you I was no good with women.

28:24.289 --> 28:26.499
My Lord Cromwell.

28:26.958 --> 28:31.754
Do you deny that you spoke to me of her beauty?
Of the desirability of my marriage to her?

28:31.754 --> 28:32.964
No. Your Majesty.

28:33.006 --> 28:37.844
And if I had misled your Majesty and His Council
by commendations based on false reports,

28:37.844 --> 28:39.512
then, I am truly sorry for them.

28:39.512 --> 28:43.057
If I had known what I know now,
she would never have been brought here!

28:44.601 --> 28:47.228
What remedy Mr. Cromwell?

28:52.192 --> 28:55.069
Your Majesty have to say that there is none.

28:55.069 --> 28:58.406
That's hardly the case, you've been following
the Cleves agenda since the beginning.

28:59.824 --> 29:01.993
Go on.

29:03.328 --> 29:07.207
Today, the Emperor is the guest
of the King of France.

29:09.334 --> 29:12.128
They have renewed their alliance.

29:12.170 --> 29:15.298
If we now reject our German allies,
then England will

29:15.298 --> 29:19.385
remain alone and friendless and
at the mercy of the King and Emperor.

29:19.802 --> 29:22.514
Your Majesty, if you break this
marriage contract now

29:22.555 --> 29:27.602
you risk the possibility that even
Duke William himself might retaliate against us.

29:37.946 --> 29:42.867
I am sorry that your Majesty has
no better contempt.

29:48.206 --> 29:51.793
I'm not well handled, Sir Cromwell.

30:01.177 --> 30:04.222
Majesty.

30:58.067 --> 31:00.069
Milady.

31:02.238 --> 31:05.325
I am here to welcome you
to what is yours.

31:08.286 --> 31:13.041
Your Majesty is very gracious
and I am very happy.

31:25.345 --> 31:29.140
My daughters,
Princess Mary...

31:34.395 --> 31:36.105
Madame.

31:39.567 --> 31:42.320
The Princess Elizabeth.

31:50.829 --> 31:54.290
For you... I think they are pretty.

31:54.791 --> 31:59.003
Thank you Princess. I think you are pretty too.

32:03.591 --> 32:06.135
I shall love them both.

32:34.622 --> 32:36.249
I like her not.

32:36.916 --> 32:39.169
But it seems Your Majesty must marry her.

32:39.169 --> 32:41.963
Who says I must? Cromwell?

32:42.547 --> 32:44.716
I have my lawyers working on it.

32:44.716 --> 32:47.427
The betrothed can be prevented on two grounds:

32:47.468 --> 32:49.888
Either the German envoy fails to bring
the commission from the Duke

32:49.888 --> 32:52.807
authorizing them to conclude the legalities
of the marriage,

32:53.391 --> 32:57.020
Or they can't provide written evidence that
her previous betrothed was formerly revoked.

32:57.020 --> 32:59.314
Either way I can get out of it.

33:02.025 --> 33:04.944
I wish in my heart that your majesty
is successful.

33:05.862 --> 33:10.492
It seems to me that my lord Cromwell
is to keen to stress there's no remedy.

33:11.493 --> 33:13.369
The marriage was his idea.

33:13.411 --> 33:15.497
There were other candidates.

33:15.538 --> 33:19.125
The Duchess of Milan is supposed to be the most
desirable woman in the world!

33:19.125 --> 33:21.169
Instead of which...

33:25.131 --> 33:30.970
Perhaps, in this matter, Lord Cromwell
has overreached himself.

33:33.556 --> 33:36.142
Perhaps.

33:39.020 --> 33:40.855
Oh God!

33:40.855 --> 33:44.984
If there is no remedy I must put
my neck into this yoke.

34:17.516 --> 34:19.518
My Lord!

34:21.896 --> 34:24.565
I'm sorry Lord Cromwell, I didn't see you, I...

34:28.110 --> 34:30.321
I was talking to God.

34:31.781 --> 34:34.701
But surely say you have to go to church for that.

34:35.534 --> 34:38.871
Do you understand nothing about Reforms?

34:39.664 --> 34:43.835
God is not just in church, he is... everywhere.

34:44.668 --> 34:47.297
We do not need priests to speak for us.

34:47.338 --> 34:52.969
We can... speak to Him ourselves,
and He will listen.

34:53.344 --> 34:57.432
There's no need for bells, and books and candles.

34:57.807 --> 35:02.020
All you need is... your soul.

35:05.315 --> 35:09.027
Now go away. Think.

35:14.782 --> 35:16.659
Wait!

36:09.212 --> 36:11.506
Today is the fifth of the Epiphany,

36:12.048 --> 36:14.425
and my wedding day.

36:15.343 --> 36:18.888
So, there is no legal remedy?

36:18.888 --> 36:23.017
None that it was possible
to discover, Your Majesty.

36:25.395 --> 36:27.981
I am not well handled.

36:29.148 --> 36:31.943
I think when Your Majesty gets
to know the lady better...

36:31.943 --> 36:34.904
I don't want to know the lady better Mr Cromwell!

36:34.904 --> 36:37.448
The notion of it repulses me.

36:43.121 --> 36:46.124
My Lord, if it were not
to satisfy the world and my realm,

36:46.124 --> 36:50.003
I would not do what I must do this day
for no earthly thing!

39:21.946 --> 39:23.990
Shall we to bed?

39:27.035 --> 39:29.496
Majesty.

39:38.588 --> 39:42.383
Majesty.

42:46.484 --> 42:48.862
How does Your Majesty like the Queen?

42:50.697 --> 42:54.742
Surely My Lord, I didn't like her very much
before, I like her much worse now.

42:54.993 --> 42:58.288
She is nothing fair and has evil smells about her.

42:59.122 --> 43:03.084
And I know she's no maid because of
the looseness of her breasts and other tokens.

43:03.084 --> 43:07.130
So I had neither the will nor
the courage to prove the rest.

43:07.422 --> 43:10.967
I have no appetite for unpleasant airs.

43:11.342 --> 43:14.179
I left her as good a maid as I found her.

43:14.179 --> 43:18.433
And now my Lord, leave me. I'm very busy.

43:21.561 --> 43:23.646
Majesty.

43:57.013 --> 43:58.681
Speak out!

43:58.681 --> 44:01.559
- I couldn't sleep. Who is there?
- No one.

44:02.185 --> 44:05.980
- Go back to bed. Should I come to you later?

44:07.482 --> 44:09.984
If you could still be my sweet Charles.

44:10.026 --> 44:12.362
I am as good as I may be.

44:12.654 --> 44:15.490
Can't you take me as I am?

44:18.326 --> 44:20.829
I love you Catherine.

44:34.759 --> 44:38.805
I have drained to the pus
from Your Majesty's wound.

44:39.097 --> 44:44.519
Your Majesty should feel no more pain.
I expede to God.

44:52.986 --> 44:58.950
Forgive me, but is Your Majesty
troubled by... other things?

45:02.245 --> 45:06.207
I have been unabled to consumate
my marriage with Lady Anne.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.922
I find her body in such a sort,
disordered and indisposed,

45:13.965 --> 45:17.468
that it doesn't excite me
or provoke any lust in me.

45:20.180 --> 45:22.807
Have you heard any rumors of it?

45:22.807 --> 45:25.852
Not at all, Your Majesty.

45:26.311 --> 45:29.480
It has not anything to do with my virility.

45:29.480 --> 45:35.320
Indeed, these last nights, I have had
pollutione and nocturne in somno.

45:36.029 --> 45:38.114
Two nocturnal emissions...

45:38.156 --> 45:42.952
You see, I know myself perfectly able
to... perform the act with others,

45:43.453 --> 45:46.206
just not with her.

45:46.539 --> 45:51.002
With her I have no appetite to do
what a man should do with his wife.

46:16.236 --> 46:18.947
- My Lord Cromwell?
- Majesty.

46:22.659 --> 46:24.911
May we speak alone?

46:24.911 --> 46:27.080
Alone?

46:28.540 --> 46:32.460
Oh, yeah. Of course.

46:37.215 --> 46:39.300
My Lord.

46:40.885 --> 46:44.389
Madam, I've come on a delicate matter, forgive me.

46:44.931 --> 46:49.310
I... must warn you againt antagonizing the King.

46:51.187 --> 46:56.609
I must remind you of the expediency of doing
your utmost to make yourself agreable... to him.

46:56.609 --> 47:02.115
Sir, I am not sure how I
given His Majesty offence.

47:06.369 --> 47:11.541
It is in your interest and in mine to
make your marriage to the King a sucess.

47:11.916 --> 47:17.380
If for example, you were to find
yourself, quick with child...

47:21.885 --> 47:23.970
I'm sorry to talk in such intimate matters, but...

47:23.970 --> 47:28.850
You are the Queen of England, you have
nothing private anymore.

47:30.727 --> 47:36.232
How am I to become quick with child
when the king leaves me a maid ?

47:37.108 --> 47:39.903
I am not the Virgin Mary!

47:40.987 --> 47:43.907
You say I have nothing private,

47:43.907 --> 47:46.910
The I say you it is not all pleasing.

47:47.785 --> 47:52.290
I would do anything the King wants, but sometimes,

47:59.172 --> 48:04.219
It stinks. It smells, yeah?
You understand?

48:06.346 --> 48:10.266
Now, I am sorry, My Lord.

48:10.725 --> 48:16.689
I will go on, doing all that I can to
make myself agreable to His Majesty.

48:17.023 --> 48:21.194
He is always gracious and kind.

48:31.788 --> 48:34.082
Majesty.

48:51.099 --> 48:53.852
Madam, how do you find the king?

48:53.852 --> 48:58.898
Why, he is most kind and
solicitousness, Lady Bryan.

48:59.858 --> 49:03.403
When he comes to bed, he kisses me.

49:04.320 --> 49:08.324
Takes my hand, bids me "good night sweetheart".

49:08.324 --> 49:10.743
Then, in the morning,
he kisses me again.

49:12.162 --> 49:13.997
And says: farewell darling.

49:16.833 --> 49:20.086
My lady, we all hope you'll be with child soon.

49:21.004 --> 49:24.090
I know, ***, I am not.

49:25.341 --> 49:28.178
But, how do you know you are not?

49:28.178 --> 49:31.514
I know it ***, I am not.

49:35.101 --> 49:38.563
I think your Majesty is a maid still.

49:44.736 --> 49:48.281
He must put his member inside you and stir it.

49:48.281 --> 49:51.075
Or else we shall not have a Duke of York,
which is all this realm desires.

49:51.075 --> 49:53.745
I am contented Lady Bryan.

49:54.287 --> 49:57.582
I received as much of the
king's attention as I wish.

49:57.582 --> 50:00.293
I know no more!

50:18.645 --> 50:20.855
Lady Bryan?

50:21.314 --> 50:23.650
Yes, Your Majesty.

50:24.400 --> 50:27.654
If I don't please the king...

50:29.155 --> 50:31.991
will he kill me?

50:33.993 --> 50:36.996
