doing extraordinary things.

00:03.104 --> 00:04.072
9-1-1 returns.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.239
We're gonna find you.

00:05.273 --> 00:07.141
ANNOUNCER: Catch
all-new episodes Mondays

00:07.175 --> 00:09.143

Prodigal Son, Almost Family

00:12.080 --> 00:13.581
There's more to the story
than you know.

00:20.621 --> 00:24.024
BECKERSON: All right, everyone,
enjoy the harvest festival.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.527
But remember the rules.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.864
Let's play nicely out there,
and do not wander off.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.700
We'll meet back here at noon

00:32.733 --> 00:34.935
and not one second more.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.070
Really, Ms. Beckerson?

00:36.104 --> 00:37.538
Did you bring a stopwatch?

00:37.571 --> 00:39.373
BECKERSON: We may not be
in a classroom,

00:39.407 --> 00:41.275
but this is still
a school outing,

00:41.309 --> 00:43.077
And I will still give
you a detention.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.612
You won't need to,
Ms. Beckerson.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.181
Yeah, we're here
to celebrate the harvest

00:47.215 --> 00:49.783
and all the cornucopia
it provides.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.052
Go.
And behave.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.755
STEVIE: * Very superstitious

00:54.788 --> 00:56.390
*

00:56.424 --> 00:58.759
* Writing's on the wall

00:58.792 --> 01:01.395

01:05.933 --> 01:08.136
STEVIE:
* Ladder's about to fall

01:08.169 --> 01:10.904
*

01:10.938 --> 01:13.941
* 13-month-old baby

01:18.112 --> 01:19.113

01:19.147 --> 01:20.581
(both hollering)

01:20.614 --> 01:23.317
* When you believe in things

01:23.351 --> 01:25.586

01:34.795 --> 01:36.597
*

01:36.630 --> 01:40.434
26, 27, 28.
We're missing two.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.303
Of course we are.
I'll be right back.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.104
(crows cawing)

01:44.138 --> 01:47.341
(dramatic music)

(horn honking)

02:14.368 --> 02:17.505
(wings fluttering)

02:22.876 --> 02:25.179
Two of my students,
they were attacked by crows.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.348
They're trapped in there.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.853
I think I've seen this movie.

02:32.886 --> 02:33.854
Okay, let's gear up.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.656
Turnouts and head protection.
Let's go.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.568
Damn clasp.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.902
It's fine, Chim,
forget the nametag.

02:48.936 --> 02:49.870
We all know who you are.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.507
EDDIE: This is weird.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.908
You see crows
all over the city.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.710
Never heard about them
attacking anybody.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.347
And that's because crows
are very docile.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.582
They don't attack
unless they're provoked.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.718
No sudden movements,
and we should be good.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.719
CHIMNEY: Damn it.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.725
-Just leave it, Chim.
-Copy that.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.594
Everybody stay calm.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.399
(eerie music)

03:18.432 --> 03:25.573

03:42.923 --> 03:45.259
Over here.
Dean's cut up real bad.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.627
How 'bout you, you okay?

03:46.660 --> 03:49.029
-RILEY: Yeah, I think so.
-Eddie, check him out.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.264
CHIMNEY: All right, kiddo,

03:50.298 --> 03:51.932
let's get you up,
so we can take a look.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.237
All right,
let's get those irrigated,

03:57.271 --> 03:59.773
and make sure no major arteries
were hit.

03:59.807 --> 04:03.277
Major arteries?
Am I gonna die?

04:03.311 --> 04:05.078
Look, she was just kidding,
buddy.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.447
So, Dean, tell me,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.316
those crows just attacked
you guys from outta nowhere?

04:08.349 --> 04:10.217
It was crazy.
Tell 'em Riley.

04:10.250 --> 04:14.655
Uh, yeah, it was like they
were possessed or something.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.290
You sure it didn't have
anything to do

04:16.324 --> 04:18.258
with those rocks
you guys threw at them?

04:18.292 --> 04:19.727
-He did it.
-Liar!

04:19.760 --> 04:21.962
-RILEY: I tried to stop him!
-Shut up.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.266
Cap.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.902
(crows cawing)

04:28.936 --> 04:30.438
(whispering)
They know we're in here.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.839
HEN: No, they know
they're in here.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.607
Crows are smart.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.008
And they hold grudges.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.777
You think they're waiting
for these boys to come out.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.312
They've been known
to remember

04:38.346 --> 04:41.582
the faces of their tormentors
years later and still attack.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.916
Oh, they're bye-crows,
great.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.952
How do we get
these guys past them?

04:44.985 --> 04:46.987
Well, they're looking
for two kids.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.989
We give 'em something else.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.959
(eerie, desolate music)

04:51.992 --> 04:58.832
*

05:06.073 --> 05:08.141
So what happens
if they fly over here?

05:08.175 --> 05:10.811
Well, if you make eye contact
with a crow,

05:10.844 --> 05:12.713
it could change its behavior.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.582
-For better or worse?
-Unclear.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.687
Whoa, guys.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.858
(caws)

05:24.892 --> 05:28.128
Okay, he's making eye contact
with me.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.698
He's not attacking. Go.
(whispering) Go, go, go, go.

05:30.731 --> 05:34.334
(playfully tense music)

05:34.368 --> 05:36.637
Hey, little buddy.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.707
You hungry, pal, huh?

05:39.740 --> 05:42.843
(whispering) How about
a nice, delicious granola bar?

05:44.077 --> 05:46.146
Yeah?

05:46.179 --> 05:47.915
Here you go.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.553
Nice little birdie.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.856
-Nice...
-(engine starts)

05:55.889 --> 05:57.591
Symbol of death and pestilence.

I think they're on to us.

HEN: Who?

Is that where you want it?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.202
Yeah, just center it up
with the chairs.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.236
All right.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.573
(dog howls distantly)

06:45.606 --> 06:47.908
A house full of teenagers
alone on Halloween.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.743
That doesn't feel
like a bad idea to you?

06:49.777 --> 06:51.945
ATHENA: Eight responsible
young adults

06:51.979 --> 06:54.548
just watching scary movies
and ordering pizza,

06:54.582 --> 06:55.983
it'll be fine.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.317
Well, I would just
feel better

06:57.350 --> 06:58.418
if one of us
was here for it.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.754
(chuckles)
Doubt that.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.757
What, you think
I haven't noticed?

07:03.791 --> 07:06.226
You haven't gotten a full
night's sleep in over a week,

07:06.259 --> 07:07.928
and there are seven different
kind of baked goods

07:07.961 --> 07:09.262
in our kitchen.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.398
Just looking for something
to do at 3:00 in the morning.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.433
You're worried
about tomorrow.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.068
Buck's first day back.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.605
Well, he has signed
every liability waiver

07:17.638 --> 07:19.740
and release form
the department threw at him.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.942
Pretty sure we could drop
a piano on Buck's head

07:21.975 --> 07:23.243
and he wouldn't be able
to sue the city for it.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.813
(laughs) Is that something
you planning on doing?

07:25.846 --> 07:27.848
I don't know what I'm doing.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.117
Well, he just--he doesn't think
things through.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.520
He acts, reacts, and that
leaves the rest of us

07:32.553 --> 07:33.453
to have to deal
with the fallout.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.089
Yeah, and the hurt feelings.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.959
Look, you are allowed
to be angry with Buck

07:38.992 --> 07:41.629
and worried about this decision
that he's made,

07:41.662 --> 07:43.664
but you care about the kid.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.700
Don't let the other stuff
make you lose sight of that.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.637

Welcome back.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.341
You are the first person
to say that to me.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.510
Starting to feel like I should
have brought a sweater

08:30.544 --> 08:33.747
'cause I am definitely
catching a chill.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.183
You got friends here, Buck.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.652
But they all feel like
they gotta follow Cap's lead.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.987
He's still--

08:40.020 --> 08:43.691
Not in a congratulatory cake
and banner place yet.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.161
Hey.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.763
Red velvet.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.865
It bleeds when you cut it.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.567
(laughs)

08:54.568 --> 08:56.136
I missed you guys.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.708
Hey, how is the, uh,
baby-making going?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.542
You and Karen knocked up yet?

09:02.576 --> 09:06.780
Mm, it's a long process.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.583
It's more twists and turns
than you might expect.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.754
It's good to have you back.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.790
BUCK: Thanks, Hen.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.927
For this and...

09:19.960 --> 09:23.964
for not feeling like you need
to follow Bobby's lead.

09:23.997 --> 09:27.267
I march to the beat
of my own drum.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.402
Always have.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.104
You should too.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.272

09:38.278 --> 09:42.049
Whew, dude, are you okay?
That's a monster.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.117
Just roughhousing
with my kid.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.919
Were you playing
with hammers?

09:45.953 --> 09:47.621
Nothing you need
to be concerned with.

glad to be back.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.328
All right, now that we've got
that out of the way,

with you guys? Cap.

remember?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.617
TARA: Okay, yeah.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.921
That's--no.
I don't know.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.756
The dealership said they'd call
when they figure out

10:22.790 --> 10:25.458
why my car won't start, again.

10:25.492 --> 10:28.929
Maddie, my client, you met her.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.431
Okay, okay, I know.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.933
Everything all right?

10:32.966 --> 10:35.135
Yeah.
My husband bought me

10:35.168 --> 10:37.671
a car that "looked cool,"
but now it's my fault

10:37.705 --> 10:39.840
every time it breaks down.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.274
Oh, here, you can just drop
that on the curb,

10:41.308 --> 10:42.209
I don't wanna keep you.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.144
It's enough
that you drove me home.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.378
No, don't worry about it.
Wasn't gonna leave you

10:45.412 --> 10:47.815
in a parking lot with a car
that didn't start.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.983
I wasn't expecting
all the luggage.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.319
Yeah, I would have left it
all in my car,

10:52.352 --> 10:55.488
but I have some appointments
tomorrow, private clients.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.257
Thanks again.
I owe you.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.492
You know, I just, uh--

10:59.526 --> 11:01.528
I just thought of a way
you could repay me.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.697
Can I use your bathroom?

11:05.098 --> 11:08.368
Sure, yeah.
Come on in.

11:16.443 --> 11:20.680
-(cell phone ringing)
-Uh, bathroom's over there.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.850
Hey.

11:22.883 --> 11:26.219
No, Vincent,
it's not like that.

11:26.253 --> 11:30.257
Vincent, I--I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.926
(whispering) Just listen to me.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.695
I tried, I really--
but they wouldn't let me--

11:35.729 --> 11:38.665
(suspenseful music)

11:38.698 --> 11:45.739
*

12:23.410 --> 12:25.378
Thought you needed
to use the bathroom?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.080
You walked right past it.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.549
I am sorry.
You caught me.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.986
The view up here is amazing,

12:33.020 --> 12:37.224
and I just had to see it.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.160
-Do you want a drink?
-Sure.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.330
TARA: I'm afraid I don't have
anything to go with that.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.498
We don't entertain much.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.601
Vincent hates
having people over.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.403
Ah.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.506
My ex was a lot
like that, too.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.009
Always wanted it
to just be the two of us.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.244
Ugh.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.980
Me, I needed friends, family,

13:00.013 --> 13:02.082
you know, a life
outside our home.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.951
Right, I mean,
he just doesn't get that.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.119
And that is why I love my job.

13:06.153 --> 13:09.456
I get to meet new people
and actually talk to them.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.925
I'm sure you have
other people to talk to.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.261
You know, people you trust?

13:14.294 --> 13:15.528
Of course, yeah.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.697
(mellow pop music plays
over speakers)

13:17.730 --> 13:23.503
So is that why your ex is...
an ex?

13:24.872 --> 13:26.506
(sighs)
Part of it.

13:28.641 --> 13:33.413
I spent a lot of years trying
to be the perfect wife.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.284
Then I realized one day
that I deserved better.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.219
So you left him.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.990
Good for you.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.994
I, um, can't imagine
that was easy.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.262
Yeah, leaving
is always scary.

13:50.663 --> 13:55.235
But I am proof
that there's always a way out.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.708
(Tom Petty & the
Heartbreakers'"American Girl")

14:01.741 --> 14:03.210
*

14:03.243 --> 14:06.914
TOM: * Well,
she was an American girl *

14:06.947 --> 14:08.348
WOMAN: No, I got it.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.683
I printed the list out
before I left work.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.519
It was multiple pages.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.087
WOMAN (over phone): I thought
the party rental people

14:14.121 --> 14:15.388
were coming at 8:00.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.757
Turns out it's a window,
8:00 to 2:00.

14:17.790 --> 14:18.992
Six hours?

14:19.026 --> 14:21.861
Ugh, fine,
I will run the errands

14:21.895 --> 14:23.396
while you wait
for the delivery guys.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.198
WOMAN (over phone): Thanks!
It's gonna be an epic party.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.499
-Bye.
-(phone beeps)

14:26.533 --> 14:28.568
I'm not even gonna have time
to get a costume.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.869
(gasps)

14:29.903 --> 14:31.471
(screams)

14:36.643 --> 14:39.379
TOM:
* Make it last all night

14:39.412 --> 14:43.951
* She was an American girl

14:49.722 --> 14:50.958
* Uh huh huh

14:50.991 --> 14:54.127
*

15:11.478 --> 15:14.347
(ominous music)

15:21.254 --> 15:23.223
Why did I always think
that she was his sister,

15:23.256 --> 15:24.657
and that's why he was trying
to kill her?

15:24.691 --> 15:25.959
Because she is but you don't

15:25.993 --> 15:27.494
find that out
until Halloween II.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.829
Truthfully, I've always thought
that was a bit of a retcon.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.499
So what happens
in the third movie?

15:32.532 --> 15:34.734
Nothing that has anything
to do with Michael Myers.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.337
-Right.
-(laughter)

15:37.370 --> 15:38.271
Maddie?

15:38.305 --> 15:40.840
-Hey!
-What are you doing here?

15:40.873 --> 15:43.910
Um, we just caught a movie.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.113
Vincent, you remember Maddie.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.580
-Good to see you again.
-Hi.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.982
(chuckles)

15:49.016 --> 15:51.618
(music plays indistinctly
over speakers)

15:51.651 --> 15:54.287
Hi, I'm Howie,
but everyone calls me Chimney.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.789
Sorry, Tara is my trainer
at the gym.

15:56.823 --> 15:59.692
Oh, I didn't realize you were
working with a trainer.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.595
Uh, that's a very nice place
that you work at.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.264
It's very clean.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.199
Oh, are you a member?

16:06.233 --> 16:07.967
I'm an occasional visitor
in the line of duty.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.336
I'm a paramedic.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.638
I've responded to a call or two
at your place.

16:11.671 --> 16:15.042
Oh, that's so great.
A nurse and a paramedic.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.976
I mean, it must be nice
to have someone

16:17.010 --> 16:18.945
who totally gets your job.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.481
Yeah, um,
actually we have to go

16:21.514 --> 16:23.383
because Chim
has an early shift.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.318
Tomorrow's Halloween,
big day.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.455
Sure, yeah,
see you at the gym.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.357
-Nice meeting you.
-Yep.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.895
Okay, you wanna tell me
what that was all about?

16:35.928 --> 16:38.065
What?

16:38.098 --> 16:39.199
With your trainer,

16:39.232 --> 16:41.568
that I didn't even know
you had,

16:41.601 --> 16:43.836
and why does she think
you're a nurse?

16:43.870 --> 16:46.573
It's complicated.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.609
Maddie, that is not
an answer.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.181
She called 911,

16:54.214 --> 16:56.916
five times in two months,

16:56.949 --> 17:00.153
-which is a pattern with--
-Abused women. Maddie.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.854
You sought her out?

17:01.888 --> 17:03.556
I was worried about her,
okay?

17:03.590 --> 17:04.724
So I went to the gym
where she works.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.359
You're lying to her.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.027
You're pretending
to be someone else.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.230
You're inserting yourself into
her life under false pretenses.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.498
You're overreacting.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.101
And you are acting
just like Doug.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.403
This is exactly
what he did to me

17:16.436 --> 17:18.405
before he literally stabbed me.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.340
He invented a reason
to meet me,

17:20.373 --> 17:21.708
he pretended
to be someone else,

17:21.741 --> 17:23.343
then he tricked me into
thinking he was my friend.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.079
Okay, this is not like Doug.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.248
All right?
I am trying to help her.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.683
You can't help someone
by lying to them, Maddie.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.584
You already know that,

17:31.618 --> 17:32.952
otherwise you would
have told me

17:32.985 --> 17:34.721
about this creepy stalker plan
weeks ago.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.356
That's not fair.

17:36.389 --> 17:40.293
Wait, okay, maybe.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.229
But what you're doing
to that woman isn't either.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.730
You need to tell her the truth.

17:43.763 --> 17:44.631
Yeah, I will, okay,

17:44.664 --> 17:46.065
I just need
a little bit more time.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.267
You know what, we should go.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.635
I have a shift in the morning,
remember?

17:48.668 --> 17:50.203
At least you didn't lie
about that.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.472
Halloween.
Big day.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.076
BOBBY:
Think you could handle it?

17:57.110 --> 17:59.312
Teal bucket is for kids
with food allergies.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.648
Everything in there
is nut-free, dairy-free,

18:01.681 --> 18:03.450
egg-free, soy-free,
and gluten-free.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.784
And who are these for?

18:04.817 --> 18:06.386
Kids allergic to fun?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.388
Those are for the parents.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.423
Also there should be
some pamphlets

18:10.457 --> 18:12.625
about basic fire safety
that should be in the closet.

18:12.659 --> 18:16.129
Exactly how long are you
gonna keep on punishing me?

18:16.163 --> 18:17.597
You know, Buck, some day
you're gonna figure out

18:17.630 --> 18:19.632
when to stop pushing
and learn some patience.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.601
I hope we're both alive
to see it.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.606
CHIMNEY: You know,
being stuck here

18:26.639 --> 18:27.574
isn't actually
the end of the world,

18:27.607 --> 18:28.941
it just feels like it,
Buck.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.143
Trust me, I know.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.178
(chuckles)

18:31.211 --> 18:32.812
No, I do.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.581
My first few months here,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.449
only time I saw the outside
of this building

18:36.483 --> 18:38.251
was at the start
and end of my shift,

18:38.285 --> 18:40.253
on my way in, on my way out.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.821
How'd you cope with it?

18:43.323 --> 18:45.658
Cleaned every inch
of this place.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.295
Learned where everything was,
how all the equipment worked.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.697
Set a new world record
for getting in my turnout gear.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.766
And then eventually,
someone took pity on me,

18:53.800 --> 18:54.867
and they let me outside.

18:54.901 --> 18:58.505
So basically, um, suck it up
and be patient.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.139
Just like Bobby said.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.709
You know,
Cap's not always wrong.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.311
Though he is
about these smoke detectors.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.512
Nobody's gonna
want these tonight.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.980
No, but I am gonna
hand them out anyway.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.882
-Captain's orders.
-See?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.218
It can be taught.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.354
In fact, I'm gonna go find
those pamphlets.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.323
Hey, uh, have you talked
to Maddie today?

19:16.356 --> 19:18.825
No, I think she's working.

19:18.858 --> 19:19.992
Why?

19:20.026 --> 19:21.561
Nothing, just wondering.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.835
(crow caws)

19:28.868 --> 19:32.071
(funky music)

19:32.104 --> 19:33.640
(caws)

19:33.673 --> 19:35.342
Okay, are you a good omen
or a bad omen?

19:35.375 --> 19:36.843
'Cause, you know,
I Googled you,

19:36.876 --> 19:38.978
and the old wives are kind of
divided on this question.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.713
(caws)

19:42.114 --> 19:44.384
Is anybody else seeing this?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.521
Seeing what?

19:56.062 --> 19:59.031
(ominous music)

19:59.065 --> 20:05.905
*

20:07.039 --> 20:09.542
Oh, God!

20:09.576 --> 20:13.580
The list,
you forgot the list.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.749
(upbeat instrumental music)

20:16.783 --> 20:22.989
*

20:37.236 --> 20:40.072
(mariachi music)

20:40.106 --> 20:45.111
*

20:45.144 --> 20:47.046
That one's so cool.
Right there.

20:47.079 --> 20:51.284
Oh, that's pretty convincing,
if a little bit twisted.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.752
It's sick is what it is.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.153
It just perpetuates a culture

20:54.186 --> 20:58.090
of socially acceptable
violence and desensitizes--

20:58.124 --> 20:59.258
Oh, my God!

20:59.292 --> 21:00.460
Whoa.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.764
That level of violence
is totally acceptable to me.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.301
-Did you--
-I did.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.869
-Was that--
-I don't know.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.940
MAN (over phone): Yes, hello,
I think there's a body

21:13.973 --> 21:16.142
sticking out
of somebody's car windshield.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.744
I'm sorry?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.178
MAN (over phone): There's
a woman driving around

21:19.211 --> 21:20.647
in a gold,
mid-sized sedan

21:20.680 --> 21:22.615
with a man stuck
in the windshield,

21:22.649 --> 21:24.083
like, through the windshield.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.918
Are you sure it wasn't
a Halloween decoration?

21:25.952 --> 21:28.955
That's what we thought
it was at first, but it moved.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.958
So we're pretty sure
he's alive or was.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.427
They just turned off onto
the 101 at Western.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.463
It was a California plate.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.765
The first two digits were Q7.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.501
I'll alert the police
and let them know.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.370
Okay, all units be
on the lookout

21:43.403 --> 21:44.804
for a gold,
mid-sized sedan,

21:44.837 --> 21:47.674
California plate
partial number queen seven.

21:47.707 --> 21:50.209
Eyewitness reports
a man in the windshield.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.311
MAN (over radio): Dispatch,
is this a real thing?

21:52.345 --> 21:54.080
Find the car
and get back to me.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.517
Okay, so far today

21:57.550 --> 21:59.352
I've had three
suspected hangings,

21:59.386 --> 22:01.287
two possible decapitations,

22:01.320 --> 22:04.023
and one truly convincing
evisceration.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.358
Hmm, let me guess.
All fake?

22:05.392 --> 22:08.361
Thank God, or L.A. is having
a seriously weird crime spree.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.430
(laughs)

22:11.030 --> 22:12.699
Nice costume.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.501
Did that take 12 whole minutes
to put together?

22:14.534 --> 22:16.669
Ew, no, it took 45 minutes

22:16.703 --> 22:18.004
to go to the drugstore
and get these ears.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.672
Mm.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.574
9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

22:22.942 --> 22:24.911
BUCK: That's it,
get your candy.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sorry, buddy, two-piece limit.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.318
Those are the rules.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.853
That's a stupid rule.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.922
Yeah, not the world's
greatest defense strategy.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.524
What are you supposed to be,
anyway?

22:37.557 --> 22:38.925
I'm firefighter.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.794
So how come you're not
out fighting fires?

22:43.630 --> 22:44.897
(truck horn honks)

22:44.931 --> 22:47.834
Mom, look,
the real firefighters are here.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.336
Oh, my gosh. Is he trying
to get more candy out of you?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.572
Uh, no, no, he's fine.

22:52.605 --> 22:56.275
In fact, here, why don't you
take a smoke detector.

22:56.308 --> 22:59.111
Keep him safe
until his parole hearing.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.083
BOBBY: Nice work, Buckley.
Keep it up.

23:04.917 --> 23:09.922
Oh, Eddie, um, you wanna
give me a hand with all this?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.559
Nah, you got this.
You're 100%.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.561
Lawsuit proved that, right?

23:14.594 --> 23:17.530
(melancholy music)

23:17.564 --> 23:19.699
(Oingo Boingo's
"Dead Man's Party")

23:19.732 --> 23:21.634
(together)
Trick or treat!

23:21.668 --> 23:24.236
Hello, we got a big crowd,
here. (laughs)

23:24.270 --> 23:25.905
Nice costumes.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.373
(doorbell rings)

23:27.406 --> 23:28.608
(together)
Trick or treat!

23:28.641 --> 23:29.809
(doorbell rings)

23:29.842 --> 23:31.243
(together)
Trick or treat.

23:31.277 --> 23:32.979
(doorbell rings)

23:33.012 --> 23:34.581
Whoa.

23:34.614 --> 23:38.117
Are you--let's see,
are you--

23:40.687 --> 23:42.789
Hey, are you all right?

23:45.692 --> 23:47.927
(dramatic music)

23:47.960 --> 23:49.762
Honey, call 911!

23:56.202 --> 23:57.604
You took your costume off.

23:57.637 --> 23:58.805
I barely recognize you

23:58.838 --> 24:00.239
without those glasses,
Clark Kent.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.174
Shouldn't you be off
walking a plank or something?

24:02.208 --> 24:04.811
More like three parties
to hit before midnight.

24:04.844 --> 24:05.945
Jealous?

24:05.978 --> 24:07.980
No, I'm exhausted
even thinking about that.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.783
Oh, Sue was here a minute ago
looking for you.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.352
She was talking to someone
in the conference room,

24:13.385 --> 24:14.453
so maybe she went back
in there.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.222
Okay, I'll check.
Thanks.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.660
Sue?

24:22.161 --> 24:23.496
Tara, um--

24:23.530 --> 24:24.964
I'm here to file a complaint

24:24.997 --> 24:27.500
against the 9-1-1 dispatcher
who's been stalking me.

24:29.168 --> 24:29.969
How did you--

24:30.002 --> 24:31.437
I shoulda known
something was up

24:31.470 --> 24:32.805
when you conned your way
into my house,

24:32.839 --> 24:33.706
but I thought
I was being paranoid.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.041
Then I met your boyfriend,

24:35.074 --> 24:36.609
and he doesn't have
a very good poker face.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.010
Does he know you're a psycho?

24:38.044 --> 24:40.680
Or should I swing on by
the firehouse and fill him in.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.314
-I was gonna tell you.
-Okay.

24:42.348 --> 24:43.783
I was,

24:43.816 --> 24:45.885
I just hadn't figured out
how to do it, you know?

24:45.918 --> 24:48.621
How to explain everything
to you and help you understand.

24:48.655 --> 24:51.457
You lied to me.
You pretended to be my friend.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.859
No, I am your friend.

24:52.892 --> 24:56.228
Or, at least, I wanted to be.

24:56.262 --> 24:59.566
I have been you, Tara.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.834
Trapped in a marriage
with an abusive man,

25:01.868 --> 25:03.670
needing to ask for help--

25:03.703 --> 25:04.904
I don't need any help.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.806
You called 911 five times.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.708
I am not one of those women.

25:08.741 --> 25:13.012
Yeah, I used to tell myself
that too.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.914
I didn't wanna admit
what was happening

25:14.947 --> 25:17.383
because I felt ashamed.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.587
But I had nothing
to be ashamed of.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.822
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.658
Just tell me the truth,
and I will leave you alone.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.060
-I swear.
-There is nothing to tell!

25:30.563 --> 25:33.065
Stay away from me
and my husband.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.669
I know I'm right about him.

25:36.703 --> 25:39.105
Look, I know I'm right!

25:40.239 --> 25:44.443
Maddie, we need to talk.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.714
NURSE: Someone mistreated her.
Badly.

25:47.747 --> 25:50.182
She's severely malnourished.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.384
I'm not talking about missing
a few meals;

25:52.418 --> 25:53.753
this is systemic.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.722
But until she regains
consciousness

25:55.755 --> 25:57.223
and can consent
to a more thorough exam,

25:57.256 --> 25:59.125
we can't know for sure
what she's been through.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.595
What about her injuries?
The cuts on her arm?

26:02.629 --> 26:04.230
NURSE: Appears to be
from broken glass.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.699
We found tiny slivers of it
inside the wounds.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.568
Significant bruising
on both wrists and ankles.

26:09.602 --> 26:12.038
Most likely, she was shackled.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.206
Anything about the soles
of her feet?

26:14.240 --> 26:17.076
Something to indicate how far
she's walked.

26:17.109 --> 26:20.246
No bruises, no blisters,
no lacerations,

26:20.279 --> 26:21.413
they were just dirty.

26:21.447 --> 26:22.915
Sorry I can't give you more.

26:22.949 --> 26:26.318
No, you gave me
a place to start.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.488
Now, missing persons
is checking reports,

26:29.521 --> 26:30.957
looking for a match
on our girl,

26:30.990 --> 26:32.925
hasn't found anything yet.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.762
Fan out, do a grid search,
knock on every door,

26:35.795 --> 26:37.764
talk to every person
you see in the street.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.799
Then ask them what,
see anything unusual?

26:39.832 --> 26:40.967
It's Halloween, Sergeant.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.501
(sighs)

26:42.534 --> 26:45.137
(spooky rock music)

26:45.171 --> 26:48.675
*

26:48.708 --> 26:50.943
Maybe the idea's
not to be seen at all.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.511
Let's find out
which of these houses

26:52.544 --> 26:54.914
isn't feeling
the holiday spirit.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.483
(indistinct radio chatter)

26:57.516 --> 27:00.286
(ominous music)

27:00.319 --> 27:07.159
*

27:11.864 --> 27:13.800
There you go.

27:24.176 --> 27:30.116
*

27:30.149 --> 27:31.317
(knocking)

27:31.350 --> 27:35.855
LAPD, anybody home?

27:37.389 --> 27:39.258
LAPD!

27:41.828 --> 27:44.731
(suspenseful music)

27:44.764 --> 27:51.771
*

28:05.718 --> 28:07.353
(door creaks)

28:08.620 --> 28:10.857
Hello, anybody home?

28:12.591 --> 28:15.728
(insects buzzing)

28:18.397 --> 28:20.066
(coughs)

28:42.088 --> 28:44.123
Anybody home?
This is the police.

28:44.156 --> 28:46.392
Hello?

28:55.501 --> 28:58.104
(girl coughing distantly)

29:08.414 --> 29:11.317
(water trickling)

29:14.586 --> 29:16.022
(gags)

29:32.038 --> 29:34.473
Holy Mother of God.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.443
(eerie music)

29:37.476 --> 29:42.114
*

29:48.020 --> 29:50.789
(dramatic music)

29:50.823 --> 29:52.691
*

29:52.724 --> 29:56.162
They're all in various stages
of dehydration, malnutrition,

29:56.195 --> 29:57.629
any number of infections,

29:57.663 --> 29:58.931
probably have diseases
we invented the cure for

29:58.965 --> 30:00.666
100 years ago.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.168
No gas, no running water,

30:02.201 --> 30:04.303
God knows how they bathed
or cooked food.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.672
Give it a hard enough kick,
the house would fall down.

30:06.705 --> 30:09.808
All we found was
canned food, bibles,

30:09.842 --> 30:12.111
textbooks,
all from the 1950s.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.880
I just got one
of the kids to talk.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.314
You're not gonna believe this.

30:15.347 --> 30:19.051
These kids weren't abducted.
They live here.

30:19.085 --> 30:22.989
They're siblings.
Their parents did this to them.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.290
(car horn honking)

30:24.323 --> 30:26.025
Hey, stop, you can't drive
through here.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.559
(tires screeching)

30:29.996 --> 30:31.898
Those are my kids.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.365
What the hell are you doing
with my children?

30:33.399 --> 30:35.201
Did you find her?
Where's Bethany?

30:35.234 --> 30:36.903
-Who?
-Our daughter.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.637
We've been looking
for her for hours.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.239
She's lost and alone.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.808
Alone, right, just like you
left the rest of your children.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.911
They were secure.
They were safe.

30:44.944 --> 30:45.978
Chained up, you mean.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.179
Your daughter's
in the hospital.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.547
Which is where we're taking
the others

30:48.580 --> 30:50.816
until children and family
services gets there.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.152
You two, however,
are going to jail.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.521
Read 'em their rights.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.156
MAN: You have the right
to remain silent.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.091
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

30:59.125 --> 31:01.260
in a court of law.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.036
I reviewed all five
of the calls

31:10.069 --> 31:12.104
that were placed
from the Dagastino home.

31:13.239 --> 31:14.506
The first four times,

31:14.540 --> 31:16.008
she claims that she dialed
a wrong number.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.911
The fifth one,
the one that you took,

31:18.945 --> 31:20.346
That area's a little gray.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.880
Yeah, I knew that something--

31:21.914 --> 31:23.449
I'm gonna stop you there.

31:23.482 --> 31:27.219
Here's what I,
as your supervisor, can prove.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.455
This dispatch center
received several calls

31:29.488 --> 31:30.756
from Mrs. Dagastino.

31:30.789 --> 31:32.058
You took one of them.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.860
Shortly after that,
you joined a gym,

31:34.893 --> 31:39.731
hired a personal trainer who
happened to be Mrs. Dagastino.

31:39.765 --> 31:41.300
We can call that a coincidence

31:41.333 --> 31:44.536
but there are not going to be
any more, Maddie.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.272
Do you understand me?

31:46.305 --> 31:48.574
I do, but I just want
you to know the--

31:48.607 --> 31:50.276
No, we're done talking
about that woman.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.279
Now we're going to talk
about you and your future here.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.614
I promise that this
will never happen again.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.716
(sighs)

31:57.749 --> 32:02.054
You've been through a lot,
personally and professionally.

32:02.088 --> 32:06.425
This job--we experience
the same trauma

32:06.458 --> 32:08.327
that all the other
first responders do

32:08.360 --> 32:11.397
and sometimes we burn out.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.765
Okay, that's--that's not
what this is.

32:13.799 --> 32:16.902
Well, I'm gonna have to have
someone confirm that for me.

32:16.935 --> 32:21.940
I'm scheduling you for
a psychological assessment.

32:21.974 --> 32:24.110
But I'm not--I'm not due
for another one

32:24.143 --> 32:25.611
until next year.

32:25.644 --> 32:29.615
And you will not go back
on that floor until it's done.

32:29.648 --> 32:34.186
Also, schedule a session
with our counselor.

32:34.220 --> 32:37.556
That's not a suggestion.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.460
NEWS REPORTER: A couple was
arrested tonight on charges

32:41.493 --> 32:43.162
of reckless endangerment
and child abuse

32:43.195 --> 32:44.330
and are being held
without bail.

32:44.363 --> 32:45.964
Children were found--

32:45.998 --> 32:49.201
HEN: You know, Karen and I make
jokes about locking Denny up.

32:50.236 --> 32:52.638
For his protection.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.874
But the truth is,
protecting him like that,

32:55.907 --> 32:57.976
it wouldn't be for him.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.945
It'd be for us.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.213
You know, we'd be robbing him

33:01.247 --> 33:03.815
to give ourselves
some peace of mind.

33:03.849 --> 33:06.818
(somber music)

33:06.852 --> 33:08.720
*

33:08.754 --> 33:10.356
That's not very subtle.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.525
It's really late,
and I'm really tired.

33:15.027 --> 33:17.096
You think I'm being too hard
on him?

33:19.665 --> 33:22.168
I think Buck makes everything
hard on Buck.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.636
The boy has two settings,

33:24.670 --> 33:28.874
zero and shut up
before I smack you.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.742
I can see that he's trying.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.479
It just still seems
like he doesn't get it.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.214
Like this is all a game to him.

33:35.247 --> 33:38.584
Cap, the city offered him
a huge settlement.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.519
He could be jumping
out of planes

33:40.552 --> 33:42.020
or swimming somewhere
with sharks

33:42.054 --> 33:44.856
if he were looking for a game.

33:44.890 --> 33:48.394
But he made his choice.
He chose this job.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.329
So I should let him do it.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.132
Or let him go somewhere else
that will.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.410
So that's how
it's gonna be now.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.514
You're just gonna
keep on ghosting me.

34:08.547 --> 34:13.185
'Cause Halloween is over,
just so you know.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.553
I don't know what you want
from me, Buck.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.555
Forgive, forget, make you feel
better about what you did?

34:16.588 --> 34:18.224
I just want you
to talk to me.

34:18.257 --> 34:19.558
(chuckles)

34:19.591 --> 34:21.693
Even if it's just to say
that you're still mad.

34:21.727 --> 34:24.196
I'm not mad, I'm--

34:24.230 --> 34:26.031
(somber music)

34:26.064 --> 34:28.066
When you decided
to sue the department,

34:28.100 --> 34:30.569
to make Cap the bad guy,

34:30.602 --> 34:32.104
did you ever stop
for a minute to think

34:32.138 --> 34:34.373
what that could do
to us?

34:34.406 --> 34:36.775
Look, I just needed
my job back.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.211
I missed--I missed being here.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.413
Being part of the team.

34:41.447 --> 34:44.183
I never meant for anyone
to get hurt.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.619
Lotta "I"s in there.

34:47.653 --> 34:53.259
Your actions, your choices,
they impact the rest of us.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.295
That's what it means
to be a part of a team.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.134
You're right.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.805
I didn't think about
what could happen.

35:08.707 --> 35:13.245
I was mad at Bobby
for not letting me back.

35:13.279 --> 35:17.349
I was mad at you guys
for moving on without me.

35:17.383 --> 35:20.486
I was mad that there was
nothing I could do about it.

35:20.519 --> 35:21.653
And I just--I just wanted to--

35:21.687 --> 35:23.322
Punch someone?

35:23.355 --> 35:25.391
Yeah, a little.

35:26.992 --> 35:28.660
But I get it.

35:30.829 --> 35:34.200
And I really am sorry.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.967
Whatever it takes
for you to forgive me--

35:36.001 --> 35:37.569
I forgive you.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.675
Also what it means
to be part of a team.

35:45.076 --> 35:48.146
This...

35:48.180 --> 35:49.915
just don't do it again.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.420
(laughter)

35:57.356 --> 35:58.824
BOBBY: Buckley.

36:00.058 --> 36:01.560
Candy detail's
all wrapped up, Cap,

36:01.593 --> 36:04.630
and I gave away
all the smoke detectors.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.366
Listen, Buck,
I've been thinking.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.570
Why don't you go home?

36:13.239 --> 36:14.640
Home?

36:14.673 --> 36:17.576
I still have a couple hours
left on my shift.

36:17.609 --> 36:20.312
I don't wanna overtax you
your first week back.

36:20.346 --> 36:23.649
I stood behind a table
and got bullied by children.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.718
So you earned
a few hours off.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.186
Good work today.

36:28.220 --> 36:31.823
(somber music)

36:31.857 --> 36:33.892
(car engine revving)

36:54.045 --> 36:57.449
Oh, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Lady, lady!

36:57.483 --> 36:59.251
Ah, damn it.
Come on.

37:00.952 --> 37:03.422
(dramatic music)

37:03.455 --> 37:05.891
(tires squealing)

37:11.630 --> 37:13.899
MAN (over phone):
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

37:13.932 --> 37:16.768
This is LAFD firefighter
Evan Buckley.

37:16.802 --> 37:20.071
I'm going south down Vermont
following a gold, 4-door sedan.

37:20.105 --> 37:22.941
There is a man embedded
in the windshield.

37:22.974 --> 37:24.610
MAN (over phone): Sorry, did
you say in the windshield?

37:24.643 --> 37:25.977
We had a report about
that yesterday.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.145
Is that real?

37:27.178 --> 37:28.914
Uh, yeah,
it's definitely real,

37:28.947 --> 37:30.048
and I think he's alive.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.619
I'm gonna approach the vehicle
right now.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.855
Ma'am!
Ma'am, pull over your car!

37:47.666 --> 37:49.935
You are a horrible driver.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.304
-You are right in my way.
-Ma'am, I'm a firefighter.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.606
Really?
Well your costume sucks.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.575
Okay, can I just take
a look at your--

37:56.608 --> 37:58.777
Did you hurt yourself?

37:58.810 --> 38:02.481
-What? What do you mean?
-(groaning softly)

38:02.514 --> 38:06.485
Uh, hey--you just stay
right here, okay?

38:08.487 --> 38:13.124
-Ah.
-Sir, sir, it's LAFD.

38:13.158 --> 38:14.860
Help is on its way.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.562
(siren whooping)

38:19.665 --> 38:21.867
Want us to check you out?

38:23.201 --> 38:28.173
Oh, nah, it's not mine.
I have another shirt in my--

38:28.206 --> 38:30.308
(dramatic music)

38:30.342 --> 38:32.578
Maybe.

38:35.681 --> 38:38.984
You should know,
I'm--I'm on blood thinners.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.327
MADDIE: Hey.

38:49.361 --> 38:50.862
Hey.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.333
I was just gonna call ya.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.969
I feel like I should apologize.
I know I was a little harsh.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.104
You were right.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.207
Tara found out who I am.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.844
She came to the call center;
I almost lost my job.

39:06.878 --> 39:09.515
And I'm starting to think that,
maybe, I'm losing my mind.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.718
No, you're not.
You're still healing.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.252
It doesn't happen overnight.

39:14.285 --> 39:17.322
What Doug did to me,
to you--

39:17.355 --> 39:19.725
he was a monster.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.727
And when I think about what
I'm doing to Tara,

39:21.760 --> 39:24.329
what does that make me?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.164
Someone who cares.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.033
I mean, maybe too much
or maybe in the wrong way,

39:28.066 --> 39:30.536
but you saw someone you thought
was in trouble and,

39:30.569 --> 39:31.570
you know,
you tried to help her.

39:31.603 --> 39:34.406
I really thought I was right.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.907
I mean, I thought
I could save her,

39:35.941 --> 39:38.076
that I could get her out
before it was too late,

39:38.109 --> 39:40.946
-before she'd have to--
-Save herself?

39:40.979 --> 39:43.014
The way you did?

39:43.048 --> 39:45.851
(somber music)

39:45.884 --> 39:47.953
I might be a little crazy.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.456
(laughter)

39:50.489 --> 39:51.723
That's nothing.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.625
You wanna hear something
really crazy?

39:53.659 --> 39:56.127
(whispering)
I see crows.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.863
(laughter)

39:57.896 --> 40:00.732
No, I'm serious, ever since
that call at the pumpkin patch,

40:00.766 --> 40:03.401
I keep seeing this one bird,
like, everywhere.

40:03.435 --> 40:04.803
The one on the ambulance?

40:04.836 --> 40:06.705
Yes, on the ambulance,
on the fire truck,

40:06.738 --> 40:07.739
outside in the parking lot.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.509
No, on the ambulance.

40:14.446 --> 40:15.914
(funky music)

40:15.947 --> 40:17.148
CHIMNEY: (whispering)
Okay, you see it, right?

40:17.182 --> 40:18.416
Like, you actually see it?

40:18.450 --> 40:19.951
(chuckles)

40:21.487 --> 40:24.089
(cawing)

40:35.266 --> 40:38.136
(laughs)

40:38.169 --> 40:40.739
I'll be damned.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.908
He brought it back to me.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.610
(laughter)

40:44.643 --> 40:47.212
Except now he knows my name.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.450
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a patient

40:52.484 --> 40:55.120
brought in not long ago.
Evan Buckley?

40:55.153 --> 40:57.455
-Bobby?
-Hey.

40:57.489 --> 40:58.790
BUCK: Hey.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.660
Said you were injured,
that you cut yourself.

41:01.693 --> 41:04.095
(scoffs) Yeah, I just got
some shallow cuts

41:04.129 --> 41:06.131
from the broken
windshield glass.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.432
I told the paramedics

41:07.465 --> 41:09.501
I was on blood thinners
and they sealed the wounds.

41:09.535 --> 41:11.670
But they brought you here,
to the ER?

41:11.703 --> 41:14.205
Right, no, they just thought
I should get checked up.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.441
I just finished giving
the police my statement.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.843
But what happened?

41:17.876 --> 41:21.479
It was crazy, this lady
hit this guy two days ago.

41:21.513 --> 41:22.881
She must have hit
her head pretty bad,

41:22.914 --> 41:24.650
'cause they found
a brain bleed.

41:24.683 --> 41:26.117
Probably why
she was so confused.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.953
And what about the guy
on the windshield.

41:27.986 --> 41:31.690
In surgery, docs say
he's got a fair chance.

41:32.758 --> 41:35.026
It's cause you jumped
in there and saved him.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.062
Probably didn't even occur
to you to worry about yourself.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.565
Yeah, I know, I know,
I didn't think,

41:39.598 --> 41:41.299
just rushed in
like I always do.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.270
I guess it's like
the uniform is my costume.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.006
You know, I put it on

41:48.039 --> 41:51.810
and suddenly I'm brave,
and I'm strong,

41:51.843 --> 41:53.945
I make a difference.

41:56.047 --> 41:59.017
Feels like without it
I'm not much of anything.

41:59.050 --> 42:02.988
Buck, you saved two lives
without the uniform.

42:03.021 --> 42:06.057
It's not a costume,
it's who you are.

42:08.126 --> 42:11.162
Does this mean
that you're ready

42:11.196 --> 42:12.864
to let me back for real?

42:12.898 --> 42:15.100
Doesn't matter if I'm ready.
You are.

42:15.133 --> 42:17.569
It's time for me
to get out of your way.

42:17.603 --> 42:19.638
Hey, Bobby.

42:20.739 --> 42:23.441
Are you hungry?

42:23.474 --> 42:26.678
Maybe I could
buy you breakfast.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.279
Be nice to catch up.

42:28.313 --> 42:30.381
Yeah, it would.

42:30.415 --> 42:33.585
(uplifting music)

43:15.093 --> 43:16.527
