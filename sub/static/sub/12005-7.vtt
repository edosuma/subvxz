- Previously on "Switched at Birth"...
- Regina.

00:02.629 --> 00:03.950
Anything in the house is yours.

00:03.952 --> 00:06.190
- We have a full bar and...
- I'm sober, Kathryn.

00:06.195 --> 00:08.466
I've been sober for 11 and a half years.

00:08.501 --> 00:10.435
- Those tacos were good.
- Thanks.

00:12.134 --> 00:15.085
C'mon, man! Let's go!

00:16.128 --> 00:17.959
What are you saying?

00:17.992 --> 00:20.095
It's just gonna hurt us even
more if we don't end it now.

00:20.130 --> 00:23.103
- Okay, Miss Vasquez.
- Daphnwhen my friend was taking the trash out,

00:23.138 --> 00:25.682
the guy who first came up
to the counter came back.

00:25.716 --> 00:27.789
- So he was about six feet, dark brown hair?
- Yes.

00:27.823 --> 00:29.726
Unlike John Kennish, I want to make sure

00:29.760 --> 00:32.598
Americans have a shot
at the American dream.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.469
I'm Patricia Sawyer, and
I approve this message.

00:35.504 --> 00:37.608
I could say that you sound

00:37.643 --> 00:39.346
like a freaking seal when you talk.

00:41.517 --> 00:43.217
Who's in? Regina?

00:58.304 --> 00:59.904
Psst!

01:01.139 --> 01:03.208
Did you just "psst!" Me?

01:03.242 --> 01:04.810
That's my first official "psst!"

01:04.843 --> 01:06.913
- Mine too.
- What are you doing?

01:06.947 --> 01:08.649
We're gonna be late for history.

01:08.684 --> 01:09.985
I know, 'cause that's the whole problem...

01:10.019 --> 01:11.987
I'm gonna be sitting
next to you for 50 minutes

01:12.022 --> 01:13.690
and I won't be able to concentrate,

01:13.725 --> 01:14.892
because the only thing
I'm gonna be thinking

01:14.927 --> 01:16.761
of doing is this.

01:20.901 --> 01:23.402
Well, now I'm not gonna
be able to concentrate.

01:23.437 --> 01:24.637
Mission accomplished.

01:24.671 --> 01:26.606
Mmm. How's the shiner?

01:26.641 --> 01:28.743
Oh, I iced it with frozen quiche,

01:28.777 --> 01:31.313
frozen pork, frozen peas,
so I think it's pretty happy.

01:31.347 --> 01:34.317
Okay, well, maybe we could
take it out for ice cream later.

01:34.352 --> 01:36.287
I do hear mint chocolate chip works best.

Hi.

03:12.296 --> 03:13.329
You making muffins?

03:14.398 --> 03:17.400
- Popovers.
- Oh, I love popovers.

03:17.435 --> 03:18.735
Don't you just wanna climb inside of them?

03:20.704 --> 03:22.672
- What's up?
- Oh!

03:24.308 --> 03:26.610
I only have one more role to cast

03:26.644 --> 03:29.546
in "Romeo and Juliet"... the nurse.

03:29.581 --> 03:30.714
Are you interested in auditioning?

03:30.749 --> 03:33.417
- No.
- Oh, come on.

03:33.451 --> 03:35.553
- I've never acted before.
- Who cares?

03:35.587 --> 03:37.755
I mean, that's what school is all about...

03:37.790 --> 03:40.392
learning new things.

03:40.426 --> 03:42.427
And Bay is gonna be doing the sets.

03:43.763 --> 03:45.664
Did I put salt in this already?

03:45.699 --> 03:48.301
I'm sorry. I didn't see.

03:50.771 --> 03:53.673
Honey, are you okay?

03:56.377 --> 03:58.245
I broke up with Travis.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.713
Oh, I'm sorry,

03:59.748 --> 04:01.449
but I didn't even know you were dating.

04:01.483 --> 04:03.417
It was stupid of me to do it today.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.687
I should've waited until
things turned around for him.

04:05.721 --> 04:08.690
But if you didn't even
wanna date, I mean...

04:08.724 --> 04:12.628
No, it's... he doesn't
really have anyone but me.

04:12.662 --> 04:15.731
Wait. I like Travis,

04:15.765 --> 04:19.267
but he is not your responsibility.

04:19.303 --> 04:20.670
Do you understand?

04:20.704 --> 04:23.338
Yeah. Thanks.

04:23.373 --> 04:25.407
You know, the play

04:25.441 --> 04:28.344
might just be what you need

04:28.378 --> 04:30.612
to get your mind off of things.

04:30.647 --> 04:33.382
Do you know what? You're right. Why not?

04:34.484 --> 04:35.651
Good. 

04:44.395 --> 04:46.596
So... what's your trumpet's name?

04:48.632 --> 04:50.467
What makes you think she has a name?

04:50.501 --> 04:52.502
Oh, it's a she.

04:52.537 --> 04:54.438
I should've figured.

04:54.472 --> 04:56.573
So what's her name?

04:57.609 --> 05:00.377
Sabrina.

05:00.412 --> 05:03.247
Oh. Was Sabrina a dancer?

05:03.281 --> 05:06.717
No, she was my daughter's imaginary friend.

05:06.751 --> 05:08.585
Oh.

05:08.620 --> 05:11.288
She wanted to name my
trumpet after her, so we did.

05:11.322 --> 05:13.324
Now I feel like an idiot.

05:13.358 --> 05:15.393
Hey, Sabrina could've been
a stripper for all I know.

05:15.427 --> 05:17.294
I never saw her.

05:17.329 --> 05:19.397
Ooh! I should go. I've got work tomorrow.

05:19.431 --> 05:22.534
It feels so good to be
able to say that again...

05:22.568 --> 05:24.603
"I have someplace I need to be."

05:24.637 --> 05:26.571
Uh, what is this again?

05:26.605 --> 05:29.541
- Design center.
- Oh!

05:29.575 --> 05:31.476
Well, they are lucky to have you.

05:31.510 --> 05:33.711
Oh, no no no. I won
the lottery on this job.

05:33.746 --> 05:36.581
Well, let's drink to
that. What are you having?

05:36.615 --> 05:38.716
You know what? I'm gonna pass.

05:38.751 --> 05:40.485
I need my beauty sleep

05:40.519 --> 05:42.353
and, you know,

05:42.387 --> 05:45.556
picking a first-day-of-work
wardrobe takes time.

05:45.591 --> 05:47.292
- Mmm.
- I'll see ya.

05:47.326 --> 05:48.359
All right.

05:51.197 --> 05:52.330
Oh, come on.

05:52.364 --> 05:55.100
No, I'm not writing a
song for your campaign.

05:55.135 --> 05:59.105
- Why not?
- You try rhyming something with "marginal tax rate."

05:59.139 --> 06:02.241
Okay, how about then helping
me with the canvassing?

06:02.275 --> 06:06.045
I... I don't know. Door to
door, all those people...

06:06.079 --> 06:08.046
that makes me feel uncomfortable.

06:08.081 --> 06:10.950
But you've performed in
front of huge crowds before.

06:14.922 --> 06:19.426
- Okay, what is it?
- I'm sorry, dad. I just...

06:19.460 --> 06:22.662
we don't exactly see eye
to eye on all of the issues.

06:22.696 --> 06:25.364
We have to agree on something.

06:25.398 --> 06:29.535
Dad, I'm just not the best
poster child for John Kennish.

06:29.570 --> 06:32.405
I'll be your poster child, dad.

06:32.439 --> 06:36.042
Better yet, I'll be your
child who makes you a poster.

06:36.076 --> 06:38.011
You know, like the "Hope" poster

06:38.045 --> 06:39.913
that Shepard Fairey did for Obama.

06:41.082 --> 06:43.050
How about bigger than a poster?

06:44.152 --> 06:46.053
- How about a billboard?
- Oh.

06:46.088 --> 06:47.989
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

06:48.023 --> 06:50.024
Oh, you came to the right person.

06:50.059 --> 06:51.993
Well, technically, the
right person came to you,

06:52.027 --> 06:54.596
but who cares? I'm doing a billboard.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.765
I'm not talking about one billboard, okay?

06:56.799 --> 06:59.501
Ivan is contemplating a massive ad buy.

06:59.535 --> 07:02.404
They're going up all over town.

07:02.438 --> 07:04.473
I'm gonna make you the best billboard ever.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.276
I think that's a very
nice show of support, Bay.

07:08.678 --> 07:13.183
Okay, fine. I will come up with
some way to help out the campaign.

07:13.217 --> 07:15.219
Thank you. 

07:19.458 --> 07:22.193
- Whoa! Hey.
- Hi.

07:22.228 --> 07:24.996
Well, what do you think?

07:25.030 --> 07:27.765
I love it... the boots,
the color, the whole thing.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.100
Thank you. 

07:29.135 --> 07:31.970
Break a leg, but try not to
hurt those boots while doing it.

07:32.005 --> 07:35.641
- Okay. Bye. Hey, Toby.
- Hey.

07:35.675 --> 07:38.743
So what's it like using
your powers of vandalism

07:38.778 --> 07:40.912
for the anti-graffiti candidate?

07:40.946 --> 07:43.648
Worst-case scenario: he's
a benevolent dictator.

07:43.682 --> 07:45.615
And if not, hey, he's family.

07:45.650 --> 07:47.517
So if he wasn't our dad,

07:47.551 --> 07:48.718
would you still vote for him?

07:48.753 --> 07:51.788
Hmm. I'm not old enough, so pass.

07:51.823 --> 07:55.525
I do have a question for
you. I need a guy's opinion.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.229
Let's say I started dating someone new

07:59.263 --> 08:03.066
and my old boyfriend just
happened to go to the same school?

08:03.100 --> 08:05.234
- And theoretical new boy...
- Wait.

08:05.268 --> 08:07.036
You're dating somebody?

08:07.070 --> 08:10.806
His name's Noah and it's
easy... there's just no baggage.

08:13.877 --> 08:16.712
Well, do I tell Emmett or do I
just let him find out on his own?

08:17.848 --> 08:19.715
I think you know the answer to that.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.650
Mmm.

08:21.685 --> 08:22.952
Let him find out on his own.

08:28.153 --> 08:32.496
_

08:32.498 --> 08:34.878
_

08:34.798 --> 08:38.232
Hey. You're auditioning?

08:38.268 --> 08:40.669
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, look,

08:40.703 --> 08:44.339
I'm really sorry about
what I said at Bay's party.

08:44.374 --> 08:46.408
You mean that we sounded like seals?

08:46.443 --> 08:49.144
Yeah, it was a horrible
thing for me to say.

08:49.178 --> 08:51.980
I deserved to get hit for it.

08:52.014 --> 08:54.149
I really am sorry.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.786
I'm not the one you
should be apologizing to.

08:57.821 --> 09:00.156
I know. I apologized to Travis,

09:00.190 --> 09:01.991
but he wouldn't look at me.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.662
He's...

09:05.696 --> 09:07.897
going through a hard time right now.

09:07.932 --> 09:09.632
Are you ready?

09:09.667 --> 09:11.434
- Hey, Noah.
- Hi.

09:12.503 --> 09:13.469
You're gonna be great.

09:13.503 --> 09:15.437
Is this the scene

09:15.472 --> 09:17.506
with the nurse and Juliet or Romeo?

09:17.541 --> 09:21.644
With Juliet, telling her
that Romeo has been banished.

09:21.678 --> 09:23.345
Oh, good one.

09:23.380 --> 09:26.382
So you A.S.L.,

09:26.416 --> 09:28.517
and the coach will read along.

09:32.489 --> 09:33.456
Okay?

09:38.929 --> 09:40.230
"Romeo is banished;

09:41.999 --> 09:43.899
and all the world to nothing,

09:43.934 --> 09:46.135
that he dares ne'er come
back to challenge you;

09:46.169 --> 09:49.672
or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.

09:49.706 --> 09:52.875
Then, since the case so
stands as now it doth... "

09:52.909 --> 09:55.744
Okay. That's great. Okay.

09:59.716 --> 10:01.350
Let's think about this.

10:01.385 --> 10:04.387
You've been taking care of Juliet
since she was a little girl.

10:04.422 --> 10:08.592
And now you have the worst
possible news to tell her...

10:08.626 --> 10:13.396
the love of her life is gone forever,

10:13.431 --> 10:17.334
maybe if you say it the right way,

10:17.368 --> 10:19.369
she'll get through it.

10:19.403 --> 10:21.138
So look at her

10:21.172 --> 10:25.109
and think of the hardest thing

10:25.143 --> 10:27.011
you've ever had to say to anyone...

10:29.981 --> 10:31.649
and say it.

10:40.759 --> 10:42.659
"Romeo is banished;

10:43.795 --> 10:45.629
and all the world to nothing,

10:45.663 --> 10:48.665
that he dares ne'er come
back to challenge you;

10:50.434 --> 10:54.337
or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.

10:57.374 --> 11:01.978
Then, since the case so
stands as now it doth,

11:02.013 --> 11:04.214
I think it best you married... the county."

11:13.024 --> 11:15.025
Hey. That was really good.

11:15.060 --> 11:16.827
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

11:16.861 --> 11:20.664
And I hear you have some
pull with the director.

11:20.699 --> 11:23.533
Well, I don't wanna feel
like I got it because of that.

11:23.567 --> 11:24.634
No no no no, seriously.

11:24.668 --> 11:25.802
That was... that was really good.

11:25.836 --> 11:28.372
And the other girl, she sucked.

11:33.644 --> 11:35.512
Are you in trouble?

11:37.515 --> 11:38.582
No.

11:50.026 --> 11:51.664
_

11:52.265 --> 11:54.226
_

11:54.227 --> 11:56.391
This is more of ca commission piece.

11:57.456 --> 11:59.424
_

12:03.042 --> 12:04.943
There's something I need to tell you.

12:04.978 --> 12:10.483
I know I said that I wasn't ready
to start seeing anybody right now...

12:10.517 --> 12:14.420
And I meant it... I really did... but...

12:14.421 --> 12:16.676
_

12:17.425 --> 12:19.051
Yeah.

12:20.055 --> 12:21.244
_

12:22.740 --> 12:24.163
Yeah.

12:24.566 --> 12:26.467
I'm sorry. I didn't plan on this.

12:26.501 --> 12:28.269
It just kind of happened,

12:28.303 --> 12:31.106
and if you want to yell
at me, go right ahead.

12:31.140 --> 12:34.042
I just think that you and
I should try to move on.

12:38.682 --> 12:39.829
What was that?

12:39.830 --> 12:42.885
_

12:52.583 --> 12:57.320
Design tables are back there
and the catalogs are over there,

12:57.355 --> 12:59.222
although we tend to go with our gut

12:59.256 --> 13:01.157
- over the catalogs.
- Oh, I love that.

13:01.192 --> 13:04.360
And these are the sample look books,

13:04.395 --> 13:07.164
which you're welcome to use
on any of your own projects.

13:07.198 --> 13:10.134
- Really?
- Yeah. Working here has some pretty sweet perks.

13:10.168 --> 13:12.937
Hey, but whatever you do, don't
use anyone else's scissors.

13:12.971 --> 13:14.872
- You might want to bring your own.
- I used to cut hair.

13:14.907 --> 13:16.908
I know all about "scissor insanity."

13:16.942 --> 13:18.143
That's right.

13:18.177 --> 13:20.112
- So you're good with customers.
- Are you kidding?

13:20.146 --> 13:22.981
Cutting hair... 98% of the
job is managing the client.

13:23.016 --> 13:25.884
That's good. There's a lot of
potential for growth here, too,

13:25.918 --> 13:27.686
and it all starts with the client.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.721
If they like you, they remember you.

13:29.755 --> 13:32.891
Next thing you know, you're doing the
living room and the master bedroom.

13:32.925 --> 13:35.794
I'm just really glad to
be here. You have no idea.

13:35.829 --> 13:37.596
Well, we're happy to have you.

13:37.630 --> 13:39.698
- Let me show you your work station.
- Okay.

13:41.468 --> 13:43.469
Hey, everybody. Hey.

13:43.503 --> 13:46.271
Um, gather around.

13:46.306 --> 13:49.208
You have all been working so hard,

13:49.243 --> 13:53.179
so I wanted to do something to
show you how much I appreciate it.

13:53.214 --> 13:55.015
So I sprung for some costumes.

13:56.283 --> 13:57.884
Hmm.

13:58.919 --> 14:01.321
I think part of my costume is missing.

14:02.857 --> 14:04.991
- You're complaining?
- Sexy.

14:05.025 --> 14:07.059
Mmm. If I have to wear this,

14:07.093 --> 14:09.128
the play's gonna end
with me killing myself.

14:09.162 --> 14:11.763
Don't worry.

14:11.798 --> 14:13.699
We're doing kind of a combo thing...

14:13.733 --> 14:15.868
modern mixed with traditional.

14:15.902 --> 14:17.537
- Ah.
- You won't be miserable.

14:17.571 --> 14:18.771
I promise.

14:25.813 --> 14:27.747
Shut up.

14:27.782 --> 14:30.517
- How's it going?
- Good.

14:30.551 --> 14:33.253
Fun. Do you know who's really good?

14:33.288 --> 14:35.656
- Noah.
- Hmm. Multi-talented, apparently.

14:35.690 --> 14:38.158
Stick around, you might
get to see him in tights.

14:38.193 --> 14:40.428
Oh, not sure that's a good idea. 

14:40.462 --> 14:42.230
So what's the deal with you and Noah?

14:42.264 --> 14:45.166
- Are you guys going out?
- Uh, well,

14:45.201 --> 14:46.334
kissing has occurred,

14:46.369 --> 14:49.871
plans for future kissing have been made,

14:49.906 --> 14:52.041
so yes, I guess we are going out.

14:52.075 --> 14:54.076
Does Emmett know?

14:54.110 --> 14:58.746
Yeah. He seems to be
handling it surprisingly well.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.719
I just got off the phone with the police.

15:04.754 --> 15:06.621
They couldn't reach Regina.

15:06.655 --> 15:11.425
They need you to come down to
the station to I.D. someone.

15:11.459 --> 15:15.395
They think they might've
caught the guy who attacked you.

15:25.406 --> 15:28.075
What are you doing?

15:28.109 --> 15:31.177
- That was good.
- No, it was terrible.

15:32.246 --> 15:34.114
I thought you said your
dad liked the design.

15:34.148 --> 15:36.816
He was just trying to be supportive.

15:36.851 --> 15:38.818
Well, that looks like him.

15:38.853 --> 15:40.654
It's not just about that.

15:40.688 --> 15:43.556
Okay, trust me... my dad
hates this kind of stuff.

15:44.725 --> 15:46.626
He still went out on a limb for me.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.528
I have to get this right.

15:48.562 --> 15:50.830
You're putting a little too
much pressure on yourself.

15:50.864 --> 15:53.399
When people see this, they have to think,

15:53.434 --> 15:55.468
"John Kennish is the
guy I should vote for."

15:55.503 --> 15:57.571
I have to tell a story with this piece.

15:57.605 --> 16:00.307
It's just one image. You
can't tell a story that way.

16:00.341 --> 16:01.575
Of course you can.

16:01.609 --> 16:04.177
If you see a girl with an axe,

16:04.212 --> 16:07.180
then you know that there's an
angry girl out there somewhere.

16:09.016 --> 16:12.251
I'm sorry. You're trying to be
helpful, and I appreciate it.

16:12.286 --> 16:14.187
I just... 

16:14.221 --> 16:16.856
I need someone with an
artistic eye that's not my own.

16:18.059 --> 16:19.659
Like Emmett.

16:21.962 --> 16:23.630
No, I mean, you're right.

16:23.664 --> 16:24.931
I'm not an artist.

16:26.534 --> 16:28.868
And I'm just slowing you down, I guess.

16:28.903 --> 16:31.504
- I'm gonna go, okay?
- Noah.

16:31.539 --> 16:32.605
It's cool.

16:33.707 --> 16:35.775
Well, I'll call you when I'm done!

16:44.301 --> 16:46.102
I'm gonna need you to stick around.

16:46.136 --> 16:49.138
Miss Vasquez, thanks for coming down.

16:49.172 --> 16:51.206
We have a suspect in custody

16:51.240 --> 16:52.908
that fits the description you gave us.

16:52.942 --> 16:54.309
He's a delivery kid at a pizza place

16:54.343 --> 16:56.178
near the park where you were assaulted,

16:56.212 --> 16:57.946
and he has a record of petty theft.

16:57.981 --> 16:59.114
I'm gonna need you to look at some suspects

16:59.149 --> 17:01.116
and tell me if you see
the man that attacked you.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.018
Okay.

17:03.053 --> 17:04.752
Good. Why don't you follow me?

17:12.862 --> 17:14.896
They won't be able to
see you through the glass,

17:14.931 --> 17:18.400
so take your time, tell me if you see him.

17:18.434 --> 17:20.502
All right, let's bring 'em in.

17:36.286 --> 17:37.386
You see him?

17:38.487 --> 17:42.089
It's the... the guy in the red flannel.

17:42.124 --> 17:43.324
You're sure?

17:46.061 --> 17:47.795
Positive.

17:47.829 --> 17:50.797
Okay. Would you mind
taking a seat over there?

18:07.649 --> 18:10.717
Now you weren't there when
she was attacked, correct?

18:12.587 --> 18:15.588
But she says the same guy came by
earlier to buy tacos from you guys,

18:15.623 --> 18:18.291
and you got a good look
at him. Is that right?

18:19.660 --> 18:22.195
Okay. Take your time

18:22.229 --> 18:24.197
and tell me if you recognize anyone.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.174
"No, I don't see him."

18:35.910 --> 18:37.110
You're sure?

18:38.179 --> 18:39.946
"Yeah, he's not there."

18:53.500 --> 18:56.097
_

18:56.098 --> 18:57.669
_

19:01.752 --> 19:02.868
_

19:02.869 --> 19:05.910
_

19:05.911 --> 19:08.275
_

19:08.276 --> 19:11.489
-_
-_

19:12.470 --> 19:15.255
_

19:15.256 --> 19:18.200
_

19:18.201 --> 19:20.141
_

19:27.592 --> 19:29.559
Hey. Hey!

19:29.594 --> 19:30.861
Nice first-day-of-work outfit.

19:30.895 --> 19:33.530
So how'd it go?

19:33.564 --> 19:35.432
Samada Fox came in.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.670
She designed the lobby
for the "Q" downtown.

19:39.704 --> 19:44.175
Anyway, she said I have a great eye.

19:45.411 --> 19:47.245
That deserves a toast.

19:47.279 --> 19:49.247
Two glasses of bubbly, please.

19:49.282 --> 19:51.216
Yeah? What are we celebrating?

19:51.251 --> 19:53.252
Uh, Regina's eye.

19:53.286 --> 19:57.056
Oh! Well, if we are toasting body parts,

19:57.090 --> 19:58.224
then that calls for the French stuff.

19:58.258 --> 20:00.226
I probably shouldn't.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.162
Oops, it opened.

20:02.196 --> 20:05.131
You deserve it.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.834
I kinda do, don't I?

20:09.937 --> 20:13.039
To Regina, her eye

20:13.073 --> 20:15.741
and a great first day.

20:17.878 --> 20:19.778
Thank you. 

20:22.916 --> 20:24.450
Wow.

20:34.329 --> 20:36.530
Oh! Crap!

20:37.532 --> 20:40.301
Campaign signs cannot be put

20:40.335 --> 20:43.204
on private property without
the owner's permission.

20:43.238 --> 20:46.641
Campaign signs cannot be put
on government property, ever.

20:47.707 --> 20:49.903
-_
- So where can you put campaign signs?

20:49.905 --> 20:51.068
Great question.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.948
What you're looking for
is mixed-use public land...

20:53.983 --> 20:56.784
Sorry, is this where we
volunteer to put up the signs?

20:56.718 --> 20:58.618
Yeah, we started 20 minutes ago,

20:58.653 --> 21:00.587
so someone will have to fill
you in on what you missed.

21:01.922 --> 21:04.858
Sign. Mallet. Hit sign with mallet.

21:04.892 --> 21:06.626
Repeat. That pretty much the idea?

21:08.430 --> 21:10.531
Just remember... everything you do

21:10.565 --> 21:13.533
while working on the campaign
reflects on the candidate.

21:14.702 --> 21:16.670
You can grab your signs on the way out.

21:18.673 --> 21:21.308
Well, I'm making friends already.

21:21.342 --> 21:23.210
Actually I think you
saved us about 20 minutes

21:23.244 --> 21:25.546
of campaign sign manifesto, so thanks.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.348
Hey, where can I get
one of those t-shirts?

21:27.382 --> 21:29.350
Oh, in that box right there.

21:29.384 --> 21:31.252
- Thank you.
- Sure.

21:38.093 --> 21:39.894
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

21:39.928 --> 21:41.262
You can't just go
rummaging through the boxes.

21:41.296 --> 21:43.998
Don't you think campaign workers
should wear campaign shirts?

21:44.032 --> 21:45.799
Don't you think you should ask first?

21:45.834 --> 21:47.834
- I did.
- Uh, yeah, sorry.

21:47.869 --> 21:50.637
I told her she could. My bad.

21:50.671 --> 21:52.905
Oh, Toby. I'm sorry. I
didn't know she was with you.

21:52.940 --> 21:54.740
Yeah. 

21:55.842 --> 21:58.477
Wow. He's clearly afraid of you.

21:58.512 --> 22:01.747
Oh, nah, just... my dad.

22:01.781 --> 22:04.716
Um, I'm John Kennish's son.

22:04.750 --> 22:07.518
The... wow.

22:07.553 --> 22:09.287
- Toby.
- Oh. Elisa.

22:09.321 --> 22:10.689
And this is Emmett.

22:10.723 --> 22:12.290
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:13.559 --> 22:15.393
Now that I'm in with the boss's kid,

22:15.428 --> 22:17.161
I'm gonna take two. Is that cool?

22:17.196 --> 22:19.463
Go ahead.

22:21.099 --> 22:24.067
So we were gonna go put up some signs

22:24.102 --> 22:27.237
in Mission Hills, if you wanted to join us.

22:27.272 --> 22:29.940
Um, sure.

22:29.824 --> 22:33.027
I am... I am so sorry I'm late.

22:33.062 --> 22:34.862
You're an hour and a half late.

22:34.897 --> 22:36.664
It was literally the
worst morning of my life.

22:36.699 --> 22:38.767
My car died right as I got on 35.

22:38.801 --> 22:41.503
And then I had to wait a half
hour for AAA when my phone died.

22:41.537 --> 22:43.672
I... I ended up just leaving the car.

22:43.706 --> 22:45.507
The car and the phone?

22:45.541 --> 22:48.644
I know, it was nuts, but I can work
late tonight... whatever you need.

22:53.549 --> 22:56.485
You know, I went through
this with my sister,

22:56.519 --> 22:58.320
and I don't need this kind of drama.

22:58.355 --> 23:01.190
The car towed, the wallet stolen,

23:01.224 --> 23:02.324
a chipped tooth... I could give you a list.

23:02.359 --> 23:04.127
It was one bad morning.

23:04.161 --> 23:06.162
I swear I will not be late again.

23:06.196 --> 23:08.264
I had a stack of resumes this high.

23:08.298 --> 23:11.300
I have too many needy clients
and too many flaky suppliers

23:11.334 --> 23:13.936
to worry about whether or not my
sales clerks have their act together.

23:13.970 --> 23:15.170
I am not a flake.

23:15.205 --> 23:16.872
It was nice meeting you, Regina.

23:16.907 --> 23:18.941
Wha... 

23:22.112 --> 23:25.880
Okay, so I'm gonna be here with Mercutio.

23:25.915 --> 23:27.782
You're gonna be over there with Peter.

23:27.817 --> 23:31.486
And you're gonna come out,
and you're gonna say your line.

23:31.520 --> 23:34.489
"Out upon you! What a man are you!"

23:34.523 --> 23:35.757
No no, that... that's later.

23:35.791 --> 23:38.326
First there's that whole
business with the fan.

23:38.361 --> 23:40.629
Right. Sorry again.

23:40.663 --> 23:42.330
No, it's okay.

23:42.365 --> 23:45.266
Um, is everything okay?

23:45.301 --> 23:47.602
Yeah, it's... just stuff with Travis.

23:48.604 --> 23:49.537
Oh.

23:49.572 --> 23:52.106
I don't know.

23:52.141 --> 23:55.009
Sometimes I just think
he's looking for a fight.

23:55.044 --> 23:56.344
Oh.

23:56.378 --> 23:58.179
What is it?

23:59.181 --> 24:00.348
I gotta go.

24:00.382 --> 24:01.982
Wait. What?

24:26.550 --> 24:28.135
_

24:28.136 --> 24:30.223
_

24:33.071 --> 24:36.652

24:36.653 --> 24:38.326

24:46.087 --> 24:47.704

24:47.705 --> 24:48.967

24:48.968 --> 24:50.642

24:50.643 --> 24:52.993

25:15.471 --> 25:17.813
_

25:39.827 --> 25:41.123
_

25:42.083 --> 25:43.367
I've noticed.

25:43.368 --> 25:45.504
_

25:45.505 --> 25:48.033
_

25:48.539 --> 25:50.567
Hi. 

25:50.568 --> 25:51.979
_

25:51.980 --> 25:56.231
_

26:03.642 --> 26:05.510
Okay. Bye.

26:05.544 --> 26:08.404
- What did he say?
- Oh, he's just gonna get some more signs.

26:08.438 --> 26:11.030
Oh. Man, I wish I spoke another language.

26:11.064 --> 26:12.428
I just don't really have the brain for it.

26:12.462 --> 26:15.289
Sometimes I wish that I was
raised bilingual or something.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.318
- Or at least in Spain, right?
- Claro.

26:19.282 --> 26:21.243
Hey, so on behalf of my dad, thanks.

26:21.278 --> 26:24.037
Yeah. Yeah. No, he
seems like a good person.

26:24.072 --> 26:25.236
I can't really... I can't really say

26:25.270 --> 26:27.930
the same thing about... her. 

26:27.964 --> 26:30.093
Oh, my dad's opponent?

26:30.127 --> 26:33.554
- She awful or something?
- You haven't read about her?

26:33.587 --> 26:35.552
She's such a hypocrite.

26:35.585 --> 26:38.678
She wraps herself in the
whole women's rights banner

26:38.712 --> 26:40.707
and then she votes the same as
every other clueless old white guy.

26:40.742 --> 26:42.506
It's pathetic.

26:42.540 --> 26:43.701
Sounds like you know your stuff.

26:43.735 --> 26:45.366
You should see my web browser.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.590
I obsessively follow all D.C. gossip,

26:47.625 --> 26:50.188
who voted on what, who
moved to what office.

26:50.223 --> 26:52.384
It's... a little scary.

26:52.419 --> 26:54.481
So I guess I'm talking
to a future Senator here.

26:54.515 --> 26:57.375
Ha. No. Well, I don't know. You never know.

26:57.409 --> 26:59.371
It only took Obama four years

26:59.405 --> 27:01.931
to move from obscure Senator to President.

27:03.264 --> 27:05.059
It's the first year I can
vote, but it kinda feels

27:05.093 --> 27:06.324
like this stuff really matters now.

27:07.953 --> 27:09.151
Obviously you feel the same way.

27:09.185 --> 27:11.744
- You know?
- Eh, not really.

27:11.778 --> 27:12.975
- I'm kind of here under duress.
- Oh.

27:13.010 --> 27:14.971
Nice.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.646
This is just a draft.

27:28.412 --> 27:30.374
I was going for something a little...

27:30.408 --> 27:33.234
Uh, I don't know. 

27:34.434 --> 27:38.158
- Huh.
- Yeah, I want people to look at it

27:38.193 --> 27:39.390
and think "what is that?"

27:39.424 --> 27:42.410
Before they even realize
that it's a campaign ad.

27:45.404 --> 27:48.100
- You hate it.
- No, sweetie, no.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.996
No, it's just, uh...

27:50.030 --> 27:51.891
it's not what I expected,

27:51.926 --> 27:55.119
but I think it could work.

27:55.154 --> 27:56.948
Ivan, what do you think?

27:58.181 --> 28:00.907
I... I think it's interesting.

28:00.942 --> 28:04.002
I'm a little concerned that
people may be turned off.

28:04.036 --> 28:05.964
They may think it's graffiti.

28:05.999 --> 28:08.792
Yeah, I mean, it's definitely
gonna get their attention.

28:08.826 --> 28:10.521
It's exactly what I was going for.

28:10.556 --> 28:15.280
- Oh.
- This is gonna be all over the city...

28:15.314 --> 28:16.708
billboards, busses.

28:16.742 --> 28:19.204
This is a big piece of business for us.

28:20.433 --> 28:23.333
And the printer's already working
on the design we sent them.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.373
Last-minute changes
are gonna be expensive.

28:29.378 --> 28:32.013
I say we go with this.

28:35.951 --> 28:37.151
Okay.

28:37.185 --> 28:41.722
I'll need the camera-ready artwork A.S.A.P.

28:41.756 --> 28:43.056
It's gonna be great. I promise.

28:43.091 --> 28:45.659
Hey.

28:47.562 --> 28:49.663
By tomorrow? Okay.

28:49.698 --> 28:52.499
Yeah, great. Thank you so much.

28:52.534 --> 28:54.701
Bye. Hi, can I help you?

28:54.736 --> 28:57.470
I'm looking for my mom, Regina Vasquez.

28:57.505 --> 29:00.540
Oh. She didn't...

29:00.574 --> 29:02.209
she doesn't work here anymore.

29:02.243 --> 29:04.244
No, she's the one who just started.

29:04.279 --> 29:05.546
No, I know who she is. It jus...

29:05.580 --> 29:07.514
it didn't work out.

29:07.549 --> 29:09.182
I'm sorry.

29:09.217 --> 29:13.120
Yeah, hi, this is Whitney.

29:14.189 --> 29:17.057
Uh-huh. No, you have
a P.O. number on that.

29:17.092 --> 29:18.292
No, you do.

29:23.485 --> 29:25.020
_

29:25.023 --> 29:25.165
I'm not really looking

29:25.199 --> 29:27.834
to get into another relationship right now.

29:28.295 --> 29:30.565
_

29:30.566 --> 29:32.973
Hey. Um, do you guys wanna
come over to my house?

29:33.007 --> 29:34.007
Hang out for a bit?

29:36.228 --> 29:37.775
_

29:41.821 --> 29:42.550
You... you're leaving?

29:42.584 --> 29:45.353
Oh, okay. Bye. See you later.

29:46.388 --> 29:47.655
You in?

29:47.690 --> 29:49.390
Sure.

29:49.425 --> 29:50.592
What did you have in mind?

29:55.598 --> 29:58.533
Hey, so, umm... 

29:58.567 --> 30:01.036
what's up with you and the deaf guy?

30:01.070 --> 30:02.437
He's my sister's friend.

30:02.471 --> 30:04.105
It's a... it's a long story.

30:04.140 --> 30:06.207
Oh. How'd you learn sign language?

30:06.242 --> 30:08.009
Uh, my sister's deaf.

30:08.044 --> 30:10.913
Oh, right! No, the baby-switch thing.

30:10.947 --> 30:12.948
I read about that. I
research my candidates.

30:12.982 --> 30:15.917
- I bet.
- So how long did it take you to get fluent?

30:17.186 --> 30:19.854
Actually, I'm not 100% fluent.

30:19.888 --> 30:21.088
Well, you must be pretty good.

30:21.123 --> 30:23.724
You two were carrying on
the whole conversation.

30:23.759 --> 30:25.827
You want me to text him, maybe?

30:25.861 --> 30:28.596
See if he can come here, take my place?

30:28.631 --> 30:30.765
I mean, you seem pretty
interested in him, so...

30:30.799 --> 30:32.766
No, I just find you intriguing.

30:32.801 --> 30:35.770
Well, I am. I'm very intriguing.

30:56.291 --> 30:58.359
Elisa!

30:58.393 --> 31:00.327
- Hi. Wow.
- Uh...

31:00.362 --> 31:02.129
I'm... uh, hi.

31:02.163 --> 31:04.899
Get dressed, both of you.

31:04.933 --> 31:06.801
I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone was home.

31:06.835 --> 31:08.903
You don't need to apologize to her.

31:08.937 --> 31:11.772
Are we in your house?

31:13.675 --> 31:16.643
Uh, mom, Toby Kennish.

31:18.713 --> 31:20.848
Toby, my mom.

31:28.456 --> 31:30.724
Your mom is Patricia Sawyer.

31:31.726 --> 31:33.594
Sorry.

31:45.380 --> 31:46.858
_

31:46.945 --> 31:49.647
Yeah. Uh...

31:51.784 --> 31:55.254
I heard that you wanna beat up the guy

31:55.288 --> 31:56.555
who attacked Daphne.

31:59.527 --> 32:02.362
I get it. That's what I wanna do.

32:04.298 --> 32:07.467
Now that guy deserves it, you know?

32:07.502 --> 32:10.237
There's nothing like

32:10.271 --> 32:12.005
hitting somebody so hard

32:12.039 --> 32:13.339
it feels like you broke your hand,

32:13.373 --> 32:17.343
knowing that his face feels a lot worse.

32:19.346 --> 32:21.914
But you know,

32:21.949 --> 32:24.884
he's gonna press charges against you.

32:26.120 --> 32:29.623
And you're 18. That's the big time.

32:31.025 --> 32:33.928
How much money you got for a lawyer?

32:36.699 --> 32:38.666
Yeah. 

32:38.701 --> 32:41.570
Well, you'd probably
get a public defender...

32:42.572 --> 32:44.573
and maybe they'll be good.

32:45.742 --> 32:47.409
But either way,

32:47.443 --> 32:49.711
you are looking at real time

32:49.746 --> 32:53.415
in county lockup with
guys that are a lot worse

32:53.449 --> 32:56.485
than that one guy that attacked Daphne.

32:59.289 --> 33:00.423
I know... 

33:02.292 --> 33:04.260
that you feel bad,

33:04.295 --> 33:07.129
that you couldn't protect her.

33:08.999 --> 33:10.966
But I promise you...

33:12.202 --> 33:15.972
this will not make you feel better.

33:24.981 --> 33:26.949
You wanna tell me what the
hell that was all about?

33:26.983 --> 33:29.051
- Patricia Sawyer is my mom.
- Yeah, I know.

33:29.085 --> 33:30.986
- I got that. Thank you for telling me.
- I'm... I'm sorry.

33:31.020 --> 33:32.854
I should've mentioned it
before and I realize that now.

33:32.889 --> 33:35.557
You hook up with me just
to piss off your mom?

33:35.592 --> 33:37.693
- No. No. No.
- You know, I don't believe

33:37.728 --> 33:39.461
in a lot of the things
that my dad believes in...

33:39.496 --> 33:41.397
... Or any of them, really.

33:41.431 --> 33:43.666
But I would not humiliate him like that.

33:44.734 --> 33:46.635
This is not to get back at my mom, Toby.

33:46.669 --> 33:47.736
Really?

33:50.273 --> 33:52.242
Okay, fine.

33:52.276 --> 33:54.511
Was it fun to see the look on
her face when she saw you? Yes.

33:54.545 --> 33:57.280
But I volunteered for your dad

33:57.314 --> 33:58.515
because my mom should not win this thing.

33:58.549 --> 34:01.418
And if you heard the
things that I hear at home,

34:01.452 --> 34:04.420
the things that she says when the
cameras aren't around... it makes me sick.

34:05.489 --> 34:09.092
And besides, you invited
me to go put up the signs

34:09.126 --> 34:11.360
and we hit it off. It was fun.

34:11.395 --> 34:12.896
And you set me up.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.900
I'm really sorry that
it came out like this.

34:17.935 --> 34:19.868
And it was... it was dumb.

34:19.902 --> 34:21.803
It was really dumb of me to bring you here.

34:21.837 --> 34:25.011
But... I really do like you.

34:25.045 --> 34:26.981
And... and...

34:27.014 --> 34:29.022
I mean, I had a good time.

34:29.056 --> 34:31.632
It was fun. And you had fun.

34:32.902 --> 34:36.639
- I...I... I gotta get out of here.
- No. Come on!

34:36.672 --> 34:39.608
Oh my God. I'm so stupid.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.678
Hey.

34:42.712 --> 34:44.780
Are you who I talk to about petty cash?

34:44.813 --> 34:47.750
- Yeah, what's it for?
- Billboard design. My dad.

34:47.784 --> 34:51.520
- You're a Kennish.
- I am of the royal family, yes.

34:51.554 --> 34:55.324
- Mm-hmm.
- A...and I have that authorization thingy, so...

34:55.359 --> 34:59.162
- All right.
- Pleasure doing business with you.

34:59.196 --> 35:01.064
And you.

35:02.099 --> 35:03.066
No no no no no.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.267
I'm telling you, Eli.

35:04.301 --> 35:07.070
This campaign is D.O.A.

35:07.104 --> 35:09.272
I'd prefer you give the
money to somebody else.

35:09.306 --> 35:13.076
Yeah, I mean here I am,
trying to pull a hail mary,

35:13.110 --> 35:15.911
and he's got his teenage
daughter designing the billboards.

35:15.946 --> 35:18.080
Yeah, no kidding.

35:18.115 --> 35:19.948
Should've gone with Nick Miner.

35:19.983 --> 35:21.917
Yeah.

35:27.791 --> 35:28.957
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:31.695 --> 35:32.928
What smells so good?

35:32.963 --> 35:35.665
Vegetarian chili.

35:35.699 --> 35:37.633
- Oh.
- I pulled out the crockpot.

35:38.935 --> 35:40.502
I'm starving.

35:45.742 --> 35:47.375
Did you get my texts?

35:48.644 --> 35:51.613
Oh, sorry. I couldn't
find my phone all day.

35:51.647 --> 35:53.548
I need a lojack for that thing.

35:55.285 --> 35:56.418
Where were you?

35:57.487 --> 35:59.521
At work. What did you need?

36:01.224 --> 36:04.359
I was trying to text you
that I was going to see you...

36:04.394 --> 36:06.161
at work.

36:08.364 --> 36:11.066
So they told you.

36:13.002 --> 36:14.869
What happened?

36:18.141 --> 36:21.838
Look, I can put up with a lot for a job...

36:21.872 --> 36:23.871
I mean, look at my time with
Geraldo... but this place?

36:26.040 --> 36:27.707
They just don't understand

36:27.742 --> 36:29.642
a person with family obligations.

36:29.676 --> 36:32.544
It wasn't right for me... for us.

36:34.547 --> 36:35.713
Well, good for you.

36:35.748 --> 36:37.816
I'm glad you stuck up for yourself.

36:37.850 --> 36:40.685
And I spent half the day at
the library looking up new jobs.

36:40.719 --> 36:43.454
- Good.
- There's some interesting things out there.

36:43.488 --> 36:45.522
You deserve better.

36:46.591 --> 36:48.525
I'm sorry...

36:48.559 --> 36:51.492
I lied to you. I was just so embarrassed.

36:51.526 --> 36:53.160
I understand.

36:53.194 --> 36:55.061
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

36:55.096 --> 36:56.429
I promise you

36:56.463 --> 36:59.298
this will never happen again.

37:17.131 --> 37:18.729
Psst!

37:18.763 --> 37:20.095
Psst psst psst!

37:22.029 --> 37:25.625
- What are you doing?
- I was trying to "psst!" you.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.859
And I wanted to give you this.

37:28.994 --> 37:31.691
It's proof that an image can tell a story.

37:33.858 --> 37:35.656
- Well, I don't get it.
- Seriously?

37:35.690 --> 37:38.423
It's a girl telling a guy she really likes

37:38.457 --> 37:40.520
- that she's sorry.
- I know.

37:40.554 --> 37:42.454
- I just wanted to hear you say it.
- Oh.

37:42.487 --> 37:44.552
Hey! Why am I everybody's punching bag?

37:44.586 --> 37:47.418
- Oh, like that hurt.
- I actually feel a bruise coming on.

37:47.453 --> 37:49.283
Mint chocolate chip ice cream?

37:49.318 --> 37:50.548
You're buying.

37:51.682 --> 37:53.348
Couldn't you draw me with bigger muscles?

38:02.235 --> 38:05.871
_

38:05.872 --> 38:07.784
_

38:10.382 --> 38:12.709
_

38:13.540 --> 38:14.635
_

38:16.105 --> 38:17.067
_

38:18.003 --> 38:21.104
_

38:21.105 --> 38:23.841
_

38:25.222 --> 38:28.422
_

38:28.423 --> 38:30.661
_

38:31.330 --> 38:34.013
_

38:34.014 --> 38:36.246
_

38:36.247 --> 38:39.990
_

38:39.991 --> 38:42.850
_

38:59.665 --> 39:03.528
So this is what is going up all over town

39:03.563 --> 39:05.462
because, as Ivan explained to me,

39:05.495 --> 39:09.227
you could not get the
billboard art in on time.

39:10.493 --> 39:14.091
- Right.
- "Right"? Bay,

39:14.126 --> 39:16.256
when you make a commitment, you
have to follow through with it, okay?

39:16.290 --> 39:19.955
That is how things are
done in the real world.

39:19.989 --> 39:23.086
You know, this could've been
amazing exposure for you.

39:23.121 --> 39:25.219
- I know. I'm sorry.
- What is this? Some kind of a Toby thing?

39:25.253 --> 39:26.918
Like you don't believe
in my policies either?

39:26.952 --> 39:28.917
- No, dad.
- You don't have to agree with me,

39:28.951 --> 39:30.750
- but I'll tell you one thing.
- Dad, that's not it, all right?

39:30.784 --> 39:31.983
I am extremely disappointed with you.

39:32.017 --> 39:33.815
Ivan thinks you're gonna lose!

39:36.881 --> 39:38.846
I overheard him at the
campaign office, and...

39:40.879 --> 39:43.910
I didn't want my billboard
making things worse,

39:43.944 --> 39:46.639
and so I thought if you used his,

39:46.673 --> 39:47.902
it would give you a better chance and...

39:47.937 --> 39:49.597
Bay.

39:49.631 --> 39:53.397
I know Ivan thinks I can't win.

39:53.431 --> 39:55.661
- You do?
- Yeah.

39:55.696 --> 39:58.494
But Ivan doesn't know everything.

39:59.628 --> 40:02.326
And I always play better when I'm down,

40:02.361 --> 40:07.324
which is why I wanted
your artwork and not this.

40:07.358 --> 40:10.189
'Cause if I go down, I
wanna go down fighting

40:10.224 --> 40:12.289
with something I believe in.

40:12.323 --> 40:14.354
So you genuinely liked it.

40:14.389 --> 40:17.287
Are you kidding me?

40:18.320 --> 40:19.985
Yeah.

40:22.052 --> 40:24.050
I wish was old enough to vote for you.

40:25.284 --> 40:27.249
Me too.

40:32.946 --> 40:33.911
Me too.

40:41.874 --> 40:44.705
Hey, Regina. Is Zane on tonight?

40:44.740 --> 40:47.838
Um, no, I just came by.

40:47.872 --> 40:49.903
Did I leave my phone here?

40:49.938 --> 40:52.869
Oh! That was you. Yeah.

40:52.903 --> 40:54.701
Mario found it in one of the booths.

40:54.736 --> 40:56.734
- Thank you.
- Start that new job?

40:56.768 --> 40:58.799
Yeah.

40:58.834 --> 41:00.965
You got that look about you
like you're out of practice.

41:00.999 --> 41:02.567
How'd it go?

41:02.601 --> 41:05.679
Uhm, it didn't work out.

41:05.714 --> 41:07.950
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

41:07.984 --> 41:10.686
Yeah, me too. It was a good opportunity.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.622
- I just screwed it up.
- Now don't be hard on yourself.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.628
You guys hiring?

41:19.662 --> 41:21.629
Rick comes in at 10:00.

41:21.664 --> 41:23.665
I'll put in a good word
for ya if you're serious.

41:23.699 --> 41:26.834
It's not bad work...
part server, part shrink.

41:26.868 --> 41:29.436
You make it look so easy.

41:29.470 --> 41:31.438
Hey, you should stick around for the band.

41:31.472 --> 41:32.739
The violinist is sick.

41:34.541 --> 41:37.543
Maybe. I mean, just for a set.

41:37.577 --> 41:38.811
Great.

41:56.696 --> 41:59.531
Hey. Where's your car?

42:00.566 --> 42:02.634
More car trouble.

42:02.668 --> 42:05.670
I took a cab. They dropped me out front.

42:05.704 --> 42:07.571
Well, if it's any consolation,

42:07.606 --> 42:09.473
I had a really crappy day, too.

42:09.508 --> 42:10.708
Sorry.

42:10.743 --> 42:12.777
I would really love to hear about it,

42:12.811 --> 42:15.579
but... I'm not feeling very well.

42:15.614 --> 42:17.748
I just need to crawl into bed.

42:17.783 --> 42:21.619
- Okay. I hope you feel better.
- Okay.
