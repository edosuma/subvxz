00:02.535 --> 00:04.765
There's something insincere
about greeting cards.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.830
They're like these little
$1 folded-paper...

00:09.009 --> 00:11.341
...emotional prostitutes, isn't it?

00:11.511 --> 00:15.106
"l don't know what my feelings are,
so I'll pay some total stranger a buck...

00:15.281 --> 00:19.012
...to make up this little
Hallmark hooker to do the job for me.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.244
So I can go,
'Here, I didn't write this...

00:21.421 --> 00:24.948
...but whatever they wrote,
I think the same thing.'"

00:25.125 --> 00:26.990
Wouldn't it be better
to have one card...

00:27.160 --> 00:29.958
...that covered every occasion
for everybody in one shot?

00:30.130 --> 00:33.463
"Happy birthday, merry Christmas,
happy anniversary, congratulations...

00:33.633 --> 00:35.863
...it's a boy
and our deepest sympathies."

00:36.036 --> 00:38.971
Signed, "The whole office."

00:43.276 --> 00:45.642
She was hitting on you?

00:45.812 --> 00:47.803
My friend Noreen?

00:47.981 --> 00:49.539
Your friend Noreen.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.742
-Sure you're not flattering yourself?
-lf I was flattering myself...

00:52.919 --> 00:56.650
...I think I'd come up with someone
a little less annoying than Noreen.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.992
I cannot believe that
she was hitting on you.

01:00.160 --> 01:04.221
-lf you don't believe me, ask her.
-I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend.

01:04.397 --> 01:08.333
You know him, Dan. Remember,
we went to that party at his house?

01:08.501 --> 01:10.731
-The guy with the really high voice.
-Yeah.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.563
Jerry, did you get my <i>Fortune</i>
magazine in your mail?

01:14.741 --> 01:16.231
Check the pile.

01:17.710 --> 01:18.938
Yeah, yeah.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.348
-Who sent you a card?
-I don't know.

01:22.515 --> 01:24.244
Open it. It's from Hallmark.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.817
-Hello, my love.
-Hello, darling.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.249
Isn't that cute.
A thank-you card from Kristin.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.915
Let me see.

01:34.494 --> 01:35.825
-Who's Kristin?
-Works for PBS.

01:35.995 --> 01:37.986
Met her when I agreed to do
the pledge drive.

01:38.164 --> 01:39.426
Did you ask her about me?

01:39.599 --> 01:43.262
Yeah. In fact, she said that you could
sit in the back and answer the phone.

01:43.903 --> 01:46.463
Giddyup! All right.
So now, how does that work?

01:46.639 --> 01:49.699
What, I get a percentage
of every pledge I bring in, right?

01:50.143 --> 01:53.601
No. It's not aluminum siding.
It's volunteer work.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.805
All the money goes to the station.

01:55.982 --> 01:58.815
Okay, yeah. That sounds good.
But I still get a tote bag, right?

01:58.985 --> 02:01.146
Yeah, and one of those
foam beer-can holders.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.152
You know what I'm doing?

02:07.327 --> 02:09.556
-I'm calling Noreen.
-Go ahead.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.994
-You sure you don't mind?
-Like she'll admit she was flirting.

02:16.236 --> 02:18.204
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hi. It's Elaine.

02:18.371 --> 02:21.807
-Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
<i>-Jerry?</i>

02:21.975 --> 02:26.173
-Jerry Seinfeld.
<i>-Oh, I like Jerry a lot.</i>

02:26.346 --> 02:30.339
-You mean "like" like?
<i>-What are you talking about?</i>

02:30.884 --> 02:33.910
Noreen, were you hitting on him?

02:34.087 --> 02:35.952
Noreen's not here.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.384
This is Dan.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.485
Did you say that Noreen
was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?

02:43.663 --> 02:46.291
I'll call you back later.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.270
So was I right? She likes me, right?

02:56.843 --> 02:58.674
Hello.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.413
It's for you. Must you keep giving
my number out?

03:04.584 --> 03:07.417
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Pitt.

03:08.755 --> 03:11.656
-Hello.
-Elaine, what is going on?

03:11.824 --> 03:14.918
Why did you tell Dan
I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?

03:15.094 --> 03:18.120
-Is this Noreen?
-What would ever possess you...

03:18.298 --> 03:19.959
...to make up a story like that?

03:20.133 --> 03:23.899
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it,
and I didn't believe--

03:24.070 --> 03:26.368
I think I deserve an explanation.

03:27.106 --> 03:29.631
Noreen, are you crying?

03:30.743 --> 03:33.974
No, this is Dan.

03:35.815 --> 03:37.840
-Hi, Dan.
-Elaine?

03:38.484 --> 03:40.418
Work?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.582
Tell Noreen I'll just
call her back later.

03:44.657 --> 03:45.885
Who was crying?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.823
No one. I'm sorry, Mr. Pitt.
That won't happen again.

03:48.995 --> 03:52.260
I'm sure it won't.
But someone was crying...

03:52.432 --> 03:53.899
...and I want to know who it was.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.894
Well, it's a long story, okay?

03:57.070 --> 04:01.006
But my stupid friend Jerry
told my other friend Noreen...

04:01.174 --> 04:03.574
...that she was...

04:06.746 --> 04:07.974
...you know, hitting on him.

04:08.147 --> 04:13.141
And so I called her to see
what was going on...

04:13.319 --> 04:16.584
...and I accidentally got her boyfriend,
who is this...

04:17.055 --> 04:18.921
...you know....

04:21.427 --> 04:24.419
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I tell jokes for a living...

04:24.597 --> 04:28.931
...but there's no joking about
the financial crisis at PBS.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.797
Show us you care.

04:30.970 --> 04:33.996
Call in your pledge now.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.437
Jerry, I am so grateful
that you're doing this.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.600
Oh, I know you are.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.171
-You got the card I sent?
-I did.

04:41.347 --> 04:44.612
-So where is it?
-What?

04:44.784 --> 04:46.376
The card.

04:49.489 --> 04:51.480
Is this it in the trash?

04:54.193 --> 04:55.956
No.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.327
This is my card. You threw it away.

04:59.866 --> 05:03.063
-Well....
-I put a lot of thought into this card.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.568
You signed your name
and you addressed the envelope.

05:05.738 --> 05:09.003
It's not like you painted the picture
and wrote the poem.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.468
Oh, fine.

05:13.012 --> 05:14.479
I gotta get back to the office.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.980
Why, because I threw the card out?
How long was I supposed to save it?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.016
You have no sentimentality.

05:20.186 --> 05:22.882
I have sentimentality.
Really. I'm sentimental.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.853
Here, look.
Here's some cards I've saved.

05:25.024 --> 05:27.049
These are birthday cards
from my grandmother.

05:27.226 --> 05:29.751
-I'm not a bad guy.
-So you save her cards but not mine.

05:29.929 --> 05:31.157
Oh, great!

05:31.331 --> 05:34.596
Well, but you see,
I saved something. See?

05:34.767 --> 05:37.099
I can save.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.667
I'll see you
at the pledge drive, okay?

05:39.839 --> 05:42.603
Well, new cards, huh?

05:42.775 --> 05:45.710
No. They're old cards
from my grandmother.

05:45.878 --> 05:50.440
Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card
can really lift a person's spirits.

05:50.616 --> 05:52.481
Yeah.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.253
-A check.
-Yeah, she puts $10...

05:56.422 --> 05:58.720
...in every birthday card.
That's why I save them.

05:58.891 --> 06:01.689
There's a check in all these?
Why don't you cash them?

06:01.861 --> 06:03.385
I don't know. It's $10.

06:03.563 --> 06:06.794
Yeah, but you got a whole pile here.
Look at this, 1987.

06:06.966 --> 06:10.265
-So what?
-Your grandmother gave you this gift.

06:10.436 --> 06:13.769
She wants you to spend the money,
to have the fun that she can't have.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.033
This is tantamount
to a slap in the face.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.904
-Oh, get out of here.
-Jerry...

06:18.077 --> 06:21.535
...a gift not enjoyed is like
a flower that doesn't blossom.

06:21.714 --> 06:25.616
All right. All right.
I'll cash the checks.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.047
Yeah.

06:28.121 --> 06:31.750
It was a thank-you card from Kristin
because I'm doing the PBS drive.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.892
I mean, how long am I supposed
to keep it?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.654
The rule's a minimum of two days.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.460
You making that up, or you know?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.632
I'm making it up.

06:41.801 --> 06:44.099
I mean, really, what is the point
of saving it?

06:44.270 --> 06:46.397
I could see if I had a mantel.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.904
Well, a mantel's
a whole different story.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.373
-Absolutely.
-lf my parents had a mantel...

06:51.544 --> 06:54.513
...I might be
a completely different person.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.705
So anyway,
she's kind of upset about it...

06:56.883 --> 06:58.578
...so I need you to do me a favor.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.811
-Let's have it.
-Well, I'm doing the PBS drive.

07:01.988 --> 07:06.288
So during the show, they're running
the Ken Burns <i>Baseball</i> thing.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.654
So I thought if I could get
a baseball player...

07:08.828 --> 07:10.455
...to come on the show with me....

07:11.197 --> 07:14.030
-You want me to ask a Yankee.
-Could you?

07:15.468 --> 07:17.527
All right.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.731
-I'll run it by a few people.
-All right. Do your thing...

07:20.907 --> 07:22.932
...where you lie to everyone.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.440
I should never have made
that phone call.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.275
-Did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
-Yes. She's very upset.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.509
So was I right about the flirting?
Was it true?

07:32.685 --> 07:34.778
I don't know. I never asked.
She was yelling--

07:34.954 --> 07:36.182
Who was flirting with you?

07:36.556 --> 07:38.319
Remember when we were
in the bookstore?

07:38.491 --> 07:40.288
That woman came up to us.

07:40.993 --> 07:44.759
-She wasn't flirting with you.
-Oh, sure she was.

07:44.931 --> 07:48.833
Asked me where
the humor section was.

07:49.001 --> 07:52.095
Humor? Come on.

07:53.039 --> 07:54.267
Jerry...

07:54.440 --> 08:00.072
...her brother just had a book
of political cartoons published.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.252
All right. So maybe she wasn't
flirting with me. So what?

08:07.420 --> 08:09.650
Oh, yeah, that's funny.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.154
Hey, you wanna hear
something weird?

08:12.859 --> 08:14.622
Mr. Pitt...

08:14.794 --> 08:17.729
...eats his Snickers bars...

08:17.897 --> 08:20.730
...with a knife and fork.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.491
-Really?
-Yes.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.227
Why does he do that?

08:25.404 --> 08:28.271
He probably doesn't wanna
get chocolate on his fingers.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.376
That's the way these society types
eat their candy bars.

08:31.544 --> 08:32.943
Oh, you know.

08:33.111 --> 08:36.513
What, you think I eat
all my meals with you?

08:37.250 --> 08:39.047
Excuse me. Sweetheart?

08:40.086 --> 08:42.679
I think you may have
overcharged us.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.346
-What is this?
-That's the extra toast.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.322
Get it?

08:49.161 --> 08:50.958
Got it.

08:53.432 --> 08:55.900
Did you just see
what happened here?

08:56.469 --> 08:57.697
What?

08:57.870 --> 09:00.395
Did you see the way
she pointed at the check?

09:00.573 --> 09:02.666
She gave me the finger.

09:06.245 --> 09:09.578
That's how waitress types
express derision.

09:09.749 --> 09:12.377
They don't wanna get
their mouths dirty.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.580
So, what do you think?

09:16.989 --> 09:18.456
PBS fundraiser?

09:18.624 --> 09:20.558
I'm not gonna waste
the players' time.

09:20.726 --> 09:24.162
Besides, the team already does
so much promotion for Channel 11.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.624
Channel 11.

09:27.667 --> 09:31.000
Forgive me for trying
to class up this place.

09:31.170 --> 09:34.697
For trying to have the Yankees
reach another strata of society...

09:34.874 --> 09:38.173
...that might not watch Channel 11.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.244
What the hell are you doing?

09:49.755 --> 09:51.916
I am eating my dessert.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.885
How do you eat it,
with your hands?

09:58.965 --> 10:02.924
You know, maybe George
has something here about PBS.

10:03.102 --> 10:06.196
Okay, 60 bucks from Nana.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.473
Yeah.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.343
-Hello?
-Hello. This is Chemical Bank.

10:18.517 --> 10:21.816
Just wanted you to know that
your checking account is overdrawn.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.478
Chemical Bank?

10:23.656 --> 10:26.056
I haven't used that account
in months.

10:26.225 --> 10:29.456
Well, someone's been cashing
the checks, and you're overdrawn.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.097
Oh, dear.

10:32.264 --> 10:35.097
I'll be down there first thing
in the morning.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.030
<i>Wait, we can do this
over the phone.</i>

10:39.000 --> 10:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:49.148 --> 10:50.581
You got Danny Tartabull?

10:50.750 --> 10:54.049
You wanted a Yankee,
I got you a Yankee.

10:54.220 --> 10:57.018
You really came through.
Kristin's gonna be thrilled.

10:57.189 --> 11:00.056
The Bull owes me one.
I helped him with his swing.

11:00.226 --> 11:03.127
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull
to the fundraiser tonight.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.922
Absolutely.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.190
Pending approval of the script.

11:07.366 --> 11:10.893
-Excuse me?
-Jerry, I'm Yankee management.

11:11.070 --> 11:15.063
-Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
-You're just answering phones!

11:17.276 --> 11:18.538
It would put me at ease.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.874
Hey. When you order,
get the waitress to point to the menu.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.243
I wanna see what finger she uses.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.786
Say, I wanted a side order of fruit,
but I didn't see it on the menu.

11:28.954 --> 11:31.115
You'll get it.
Comes with your breakfast special.

11:31.290 --> 11:32.917
Right you are.

11:33.092 --> 11:36.619
You know, I didn't get the special,
but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.525
I'll check.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.468
I don't believe it. She did it again!

11:47.640 --> 11:49.369
Oh, she had an itch.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.533
Had an itch.
She could have used any finger.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.271
That finger was meant for me.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.439
Yeah. She knew what
she was doing.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.050
By the way, lunch is on me.

12:00.219 --> 12:03.279
I just cashed my nana's
birthday checks.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.787
Looking for something, lady?

12:12.965 --> 12:15.763
Isn't the Chemical Bank on this block?

12:15.935 --> 12:18.904
The bank. It burned.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.229
It's gone.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.999
Oh, dear.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.742
You know, what you wanna do
is go down to 49th Street.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.778
That's the main
customer-service branch.

12:28.948 --> 12:32.315
Ask for Mr. Fleming. He'll help you.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.190
-Hello.
<i>-Jerry, hello.</i>

12:47.366 --> 12:50.802
-Uncle Leo.
<i>-Listen, I don't wanna alarm you...</i>

12:50.970 --> 12:53.165
...but your nana is missing!

12:54.607 --> 12:55.869
Nana's missing?

12:56.041 --> 12:58.305
I came to pick her up
for her doctor's appointment.

12:58.477 --> 13:02.675
She wasn't here. I called the doctor.
Nobody knows where she is.

13:02.848 --> 13:07.148
She hasn't left the apartment
in 25 years.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.818
I've been thinking about her.
I just cashed some of her checks.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.685
-That's right.
-What kind of checks?

13:12.858 --> 13:14.553
-I think Chemical.
-They were Chemical.

13:14.727 --> 13:18.163
Chemical? She hasn't used that
account since her branch closed.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.525
<i>What are you doing
cashing her checks anyway?</i>

13:20.699 --> 13:22.394
Kramer thought it would
make her happy.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.900
I never should have cashed
those checks!

13:25.070 --> 13:26.731
Hey, I didn't twist your arm.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.874
Your grandmother's on
a very fixed income.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.531
What are you, broke?

13:30.709 --> 13:33.405
All right, just call me
if you hear anything.

13:33.579 --> 13:36.844
Well, I cash the checks,
the checks bounce...

13:37.016 --> 13:38.813
...and now my nana's missing!

13:40.653 --> 13:42.484
-Well, don't look at me.
-It's your fault!

13:42.655 --> 13:45.385
My fault?
Your nana is missing...

13:45.558 --> 13:48.493
...because she's been passing
those bum checks all over town...

13:48.661 --> 13:52.188
...and she finally pissed off
the wrong people.

14:04.710 --> 14:08.146
So anyway, it's caused
a lot of problems.

14:08.314 --> 14:11.408
Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry.
He won't let up.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.074
Well, I'm really sorry.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.379
But you can see why
I'd make a mistake like that.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.513
No. Why?

14:18.324 --> 14:21.953
Well, you know,
because he's a high talker.

14:22.394 --> 14:26.228
Well, he does raise his voice
occasionally, but that's normal.

14:26.398 --> 14:30.300
No. No, no. Not a loud talker...

14:30.469 --> 14:32.130
...a high talker.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.033
Really?

14:35.608 --> 14:39.135
You don't think his voice sounds
a lot like yours?

14:39.311 --> 14:40.608
I never noticed that.

14:42.481 --> 14:45.780
Well, it's no big deal.
You know, it's just that...

14:45.951 --> 14:48.784
...he can sound like a woman,
you know?

14:49.255 --> 14:52.486
Great. I'm going out with a man
who sounds like a woman.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.394
Well, he looks like a man.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.463
Yeah.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.092
He's bald.
I know that's a guy thing.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.400
I guess.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.701
I know he belches a lot.

15:10.342 --> 15:12.572
Well, that's something.

15:13.245 --> 15:16.681
So Jerry thought
I was flirting with him.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.817
Yeah.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.953
He's kind of a baritone, isn't he?

15:22.755 --> 15:26.213
-What are you doing?
-I'm eating this cookie.

15:28.727 --> 15:31.059
No, no. But why are you using
a knife and fork?

15:31.230 --> 15:32.527
Did you just think of that?

15:32.998 --> 15:35.262
No. I've seen people do it.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.299
I like it.

15:39.905 --> 15:43.932
-So this isn't gonna take long, is it?
-Oh, no, no. In and out.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.633
I made sure of that.

15:45.811 --> 15:48.541
And you'll be happy to know
I perused the script...

15:48.714 --> 15:52.514
-...and it's met with my approval.
-Yeah. I'm sure it's fine.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.986
Hey! Hey, watch it!

15:55.821 --> 15:59.882
Did you see that guy?
He just gave me the finger.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.655
-You sure?
-Oh, yeah!

16:02.828 --> 16:06.229
Middle finger, straight up, at me.
At us.

16:07.833 --> 16:11.064
-What are you doing?
-I'm following him.

16:14.940 --> 16:17.670
I'm sorry. The account had
insufficient funds.

16:17.843 --> 16:22.837
We had to return the checks
made out to a Mr. Jerry Seinfeld.

16:23.015 --> 16:26.542
Oh, dear. That's my grandson.

16:26.719 --> 16:31.418
-May I call him now and explain?
-Oh, certainly, certainly.

16:32.891 --> 16:35.359
And now I think she might
really be interested in you.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.091
And Dan is obsessed.

16:38.263 --> 16:42.256
He keeps leaving these annoying
messages on my machine.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.030
Would you?

16:45.904 --> 16:49.340
-Hello?
-Hello. I need to speak to Jerry.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.839
Oh, it's you.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.410
We were just talking about you.

16:54.246 --> 16:57.682
Listen, Jerry doesn't wanna
talk to you.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.752
Nobody wants to talk to you,
so why don't you just...

17:01.920 --> 17:04.513
...drop dead.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.020
Hey. All right.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.720
-Any word from Nana?
-No.

17:12.897 --> 17:15.195
-Nana?
-Yeah. My grandma's missing.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.732
-Missing?
-Yeah.

17:16.902 --> 17:20.065
Think it might have something to do
with those checks.

17:21.973 --> 17:25.204
What does Nana sound like?

17:25.544 --> 17:26.977
Like a grandmother. Why?

17:27.146 --> 17:29.205
Well, l....

17:30.382 --> 17:33.078
Oh, you hung up on my nana?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.919
I don't know. Maybe.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.057
You told Nana to drop dead.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.391
-It's possible.
-Yes, it is.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.395
All right. Look, Jerry, we gotta
get down to PBS PDQ.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.032
All right.

17:48.834 --> 17:52.497
No one gives us the finger.
We're Yankees.

17:53.539 --> 17:56.702
-Want this last doughnut?
-Oh, you can have it.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.016
-Jerry, where are the tote bags?
-I don't know.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.283
Well, I'm not leaving
without tote bags.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.451
I was promised tote bags,
and tote bags I shall have.

18:18.030 --> 18:21.761
-Jerry, this man wants to see you.
-Leo.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.799
-Hello.
-Uncle Leo.

18:23.969 --> 18:26.164
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to tell you...

18:26.338 --> 18:27.703
...your grandmother is fine.

18:28.340 --> 18:31.309
She's had quite a day, but she's
gonna watch you tonight on the TV.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.739
-Yeah.
-Jerry.

18:32.911 --> 18:34.970
I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull.
Where is he?

18:35.147 --> 18:37.115
He'll be here any second.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.944
-You guys are both on in five minutes.
-Yeah, yeah.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.747
-Okay.
-Bye-bye.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.659
Why didn't you tell me
you were a little short?

18:49.027 --> 18:53.157
Here. If anybody asks you
where you got it, you don't know.

18:53.332 --> 18:56.927
-No, that's okay, I really don't need--
-What are you talking about?

18:57.102 --> 18:59.297
-It's not necessary.
-Would you please take the--?

18:59.471 --> 19:02.338
-I can't take it.
-I want you to have it.

19:02.508 --> 19:05.944
-Jerry, take the money!
-I don't want it!

19:07.346 --> 19:10.179
Jerry, open up. We need to talk.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.283
Who's that?

19:12.451 --> 19:16.148
Sounds like that friend of Elaine's that
was hitting on me in the bookstore.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.186
Jerry, I'll take care of it.

19:19.024 --> 19:21.424
Is Jerry in there?

19:21.593 --> 19:24.323
Well, he can't be disturbed now.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.589
Well, this situation's
driving me crazy.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.693
He's all I think about.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.529
I can't get him out of my mind.

19:31.703 --> 19:33.102
Well, I'm sorry, fella.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.763
I mean, I know what it's like
to be in love.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.875
It just ties you up in knots.

19:38.043 --> 19:40.603
And Jerry is a very sexy man.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.742
-What?
-Look, I'm not judging you.

19:44.917 --> 19:48.717
In fact, we here at PBS,
we have many programs...

19:48.887 --> 19:50.684
...celebrating your lifestyle.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.652
Armistead Maupin's
<i>Tales of the City...</i>

19:54.826 --> 19:57.693
...gender-bending and swinging
in San Francisco.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.694
<i>Before Stonewall</i>,
about those dark ages...

19:59.865 --> 20:01.856
...when you couldn't
come out of the closet...

20:02.034 --> 20:04.730
...lest you be persecuted
because of your, you know....

20:04.903 --> 20:06.302
No, I don't.

20:06.471 --> 20:07.938
Are you Danny Tartabull?

20:08.941 --> 20:10.636
No, I'm not.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.403
I'll take care of this, Danny.

20:18.483 --> 20:21.316
-Excuse me.
-What's the problem?

20:21.486 --> 20:25.422
I believe you cut me off
and then made an obscene gesture.

20:25.591 --> 20:27.081
I did? Where?

20:27.259 --> 20:29.420
Outside of Manhattan
about an hour ago.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.162
Is that Danny Tartabull?

20:33.465 --> 20:35.592
That's right.
Of the New York Yankees.

20:35.767 --> 20:38.930
I'd like to shake his hand,
but I can't.

20:43.275 --> 20:47.006
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I tell jokes for a living.

20:47.179 --> 20:52.173
But there's no joking about
the financial crisis here at PBS.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.945
Our lines are open,
so please call the number...

20:55.120 --> 20:57.145
<i>...you see on your screen.</i>

20:57.322 --> 21:00.314
This is the only time this year
we'll be asking for donations.

21:01.793 --> 21:05.285
-PBS pledge drive.
-Hello. I'd like to speak with Jerry.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.898
You again, buddy.
Look, forget about Jerry.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.967
-It's not gonna happen.
-This is his grandmother.

21:11.136 --> 21:13.127
Oh, Nana.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.830
-Hello.
-Tell Jerry I'm sorry.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.476
I'm going to have to write
him some new checks.

21:18.644 --> 21:20.373
As long as you got
your checkbook out...

21:20.545 --> 21:22.376
...how about forking a little over
to PBS?

21:22.547 --> 21:25.311
You watch this station, don't you?
Don't be a freeloader.

21:25.484 --> 21:28.146
Programs like Ken Burns' <i>Baseball</i>.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.481
And if Danny Tartabull were here...

21:31.056 --> 21:34.150
...I'm sure he'd say,
"That's correct, Jerry."

21:34.326 --> 21:35.953
Jerry. I have an announcement.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.323
-Your grandmother is on the line.
-My nana?

21:38.497 --> 21:44.060
And as we speak, she's generously
writing PBS a check for $1500!

21:45.037 --> 21:49.565
She can't do that.
She's on a very fixed income.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.301
Stop the show!

21:57.516 --> 21:59.882
I got another card from Kristin.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.850
Not quite as chipper...

22:03.021 --> 22:04.784
...as the first one.

22:06.558 --> 22:09.721
-Isn't this little bunny giving you the--?
-Yes, he is.

22:10.462 --> 22:12.191
-You should show this to Georgie.
-Yeah.

22:12.564 --> 22:15.328
-Here's your knife and fork.
-Thank you.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.765
Look, she's cutting up
an Almond Joy.

22:18.937 --> 22:20.234
I just don't get it.

22:20.405 --> 22:23.499
I saw someone on the street
eating M&M's with a spoon.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.178
What is wrong with everybody?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.940
Look, they're doing it.

22:31.416 --> 22:32.678
They're all doing it.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.481
What is wrong with all you people?

22:38.890 --> 22:41.120
Have you all gone mad?
