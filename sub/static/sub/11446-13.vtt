WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:03.250
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.337 --> 00:05.248
My pain, it grows more tedious.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.830
It will be like drifting off into a deep sleep.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.590
Oh, brother.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.758
<i>The prince is a canny, slippery man.</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:13.586
We have thwarted him all we can.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.761
All that plotting.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.930
<i>How the bloody hell did we end up here?</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:18.257
The prince will have his battle

00:18.352 --> 00:19.592
on Culloden Moor.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.767
<i>It is the promise of history.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.845
Promise me that if the time should come,

00:22.940 --> 00:24.271
you will go back through the stones.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.519
I promise.

00:25.609 --> 00:26.599
<i>Claire?</i>

00:26.693 --> 00:28.354
Frank, I'm back.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.356
<i>I'm carrying another man's child.</i>

00:30.489 --> 00:31.524
Yes, Roger?

00:31.657 --> 00:33.614
May I go outside to play, Father?

00:33.700 --> 00:35.782
I don't think I've ever
heard him call you father.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.032
Children accept the world
as it is presented to them.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.112
I want us to be together.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.789
Are you sure about this, Frank?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.957
<i>We will raise this child as our own.</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:45.705
<i>Yours and mine.</i>

02:16.011 --> 02:17.092
<i>Good morning, Mrs Peel.</i>

02:17.179 --> 02:19.295
<i>Good morning, Steed. The door's open.</i>

02:26.021 --> 02:27.352
<i>Social visit?</i>

02:27.981 --> 02:30.348
<i>That's it. Happened to be passing by,
thought I'd drop in.</i>

02:35.781 --> 02:36.942
<i>The coffee's over there.</i>

02:41.370 --> 02:42.986
<i>Not enough flexibility in the wrist.</i>

02:44.748 --> 02:45.829
<i>Weight on the wrong foot.</i>

02:47.501 --> 02:48.787
<i>Friendly advice.</i>

02:50.754 --> 02:52.370
<i>There doesn't appear to be any cream.</i>

02:52.464 --> 02:54.000
<i>The cream</i>

02:54.549 --> 02:55.835
<i>is in the kitchen.</i>

02:59.346 --> 03:01.838
You really should get back to your guests.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.932
They keep asking for you.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.120
Thank you all for coming.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.289
It would've meant a great deal to my father.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.784
And if you knew him,

03:32.421 --> 03:35.334
you know that he was not one
to leave anything to chance,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.583
including the toast for his own wake.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.011
"To Death,

03:43.974 --> 03:46.056
"the jolly old bouncer now."

03:47.894 --> 03:49.805
"Our glasses let's be clinking.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.388
"If he hadn't put other out, I trow,

03:52.566 --> 03:53.852
"to-night we'd not be drinking."

03:59.072 --> 04:00.233
The Reverend.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.151
The Reverend.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.786
Your father was such a delightful man.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.619
- I'll always remember his sense of humour.
- Thank you.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.670
The Reverend helped so many people.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.339
- He'll be sorely missed.
- Thank you.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.337
Would you excuse me for a moment?

04:21.428 --> 04:22.759
Of course.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.339
Roger, so sorry to hear about your loss.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.514
Thanks very much.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.636
It's nice to see you.

04:28.727 --> 04:29.762
My condolences.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.685
Thanks very much. Appreciate it.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.305
- You have my sympathies.
- Thank you.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.810
I'll speak to you in a minute.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.191
- Tom, how are you?
- Yeah, not bad.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.315
- Good.
- Listen, Roger, I'll be here for you.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.146
- I appreciate it. Thank you.
- Okay.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.284
Are you Roger Wakefield?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.324
Yes.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.911
Definitely. That's me.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.083
Yes.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.669
I'm afraid I haven't had the pleasure.

04:57.756 --> 04:58.791
Roger.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.292
It is.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.873
Well, I can't believe it.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.967
After all these years.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.050
I'm sorry,

05:07.140 --> 05:08.551
but do I know you?

05:09.392 --> 05:11.508
Of course, you wouldn't remember me.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.061
Last time I saw you, you were about

05:14.147 --> 05:15.808
seven or eight years old.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.389
I'm Claire Randall.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.225
I was an old friend of your father's.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.777
Very sorry to hear about his passing.

05:21.863 --> 05:22.898
Thank you.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.151
I see you've met my daughter.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.700
Actually, no, we haven't
been formally introduced.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.735
Bflanna.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.453
The daughter.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.948
A pleasure, Miss Randall.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.414
We were staying with relatives
down in London when we heard.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.086
His heart, I believe?

05:39.631 --> 05:41.213
Yes, yes...

05:41.800 --> 05:43.040
Very sudden.

05:44.219 --> 05:47.428
I'd just seen him at Christmas,
and he was in high spirits.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.261
I hadn't seen your father in a very long time,

05:52.727 --> 05:54.968
but I was very fond of him.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.350
So was Daddy.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.439
Yes, of course.

06:00.652 --> 06:03.144
My late husband, Frank,

06:03.238 --> 06:04.478
they were very close.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.981
Randall.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.066
Frank Randall, of course.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.776
I remember you now, yes.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.111
Claire.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.616
You...

06:13.707 --> 06:15.744
You're a nurse, as I recall.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.121
Yes, I was.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.248
I'm a doctor now.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.626
She's being modest. She's a surgeon.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.927
Bree and I are visiting from the States.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.472
I thought I detected an American accent.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.549
Boston, to be exact.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.889
She's a history major in Harvard.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.767
Really? I'm on leave
from the history department at Oxford.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.560
Oxford?

06:40.942 --> 06:41.977
Impressive.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.857
Is Mrs Graham still in
the Reverend's employ?

06:46.281 --> 06:47.897
I haven't seen her yet.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.403
Sadly, we lost her a few years ago,

06:50.702 --> 06:53.740
but her granddaughter Fiona
is here somewhere.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.662
So many things are the same,

06:59.920 --> 07:02.628
and yet things are so different.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.295
There are quite a lot of memories here.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.298
Would you excuse me?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.920
I'd like to take a look around.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.096
Yeah.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.352
First time in Scotland, then?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.941
And will you have much time
to take in the sights

07:32.035 --> 07:33.116
while you're here?

07:34.204 --> 07:37.322
We only came up for the day
so Mother could pay her respects.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.035
We're meant to be headed
back to London this evening.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.203
That's a shame.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.828
Beautiful, wild country.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.546
I was always curious about Scotland.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.045
It was a special place to both my parents.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.758
Roger?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.802
I beg your pardon,

07:53.640 --> 07:55.472
but it's time to say good-bye.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.798
The Browns are leaving.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.059
Yes, of course.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.469
Thank you, Fiona.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.772
You'll excuse me for a moment?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.527
Yeah.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.424
<i>Mrs Graham had warned me</i>

08:32.511 --> 08:35.424
<i>not to spend my days chasing a ghost,</i>

08:35.515 --> 08:36.801
<i>and so I hadn't.</i>

08:37.225 --> 08:39.182
<i>But now that I was here,</i>

08:39.269 --> 08:41.852
<i>the ghosts were starting to chase me.</i>

08:52.532 --> 08:53.772
Thanks again.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.983
Thank you. Arthur, love to your wife.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.034
Sorry she couldn't come along.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.613
Well, we should be going.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.493
Not all the way back to London?

09:02.584 --> 09:04.791
No, we'll drive as far as we can

09:04.878 --> 09:06.494
and then stop at a pub for the night.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.795
There's plenty of room here
if you'd like to stay.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.715
We couldn't possibly impose.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.509
You wouldn't be.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.303
In fact, I'd welcome the company.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.629
It's a big house.

09:17.724 --> 09:21.058
Sounds better than jolting
down the wrong side of the road in the dark.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.054
Besides, it'll give
me a chance to take in the sights.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.732
I hear it's a beautiful, wild country.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.978
All right.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.189
Just so long as we're no bother.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.528
I'll fetch your bags from the car.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.077
- The guest room's just...
- Top of the stairs.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.198
I remember.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.854
I couldn't sleep, so I helped myself to a dram.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.723
I hope you don't mind.

10:10.860 --> 10:11.941
No bother.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.106
I'll have one with you.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.170
That's better.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.465
You know, I pestered him
for years to throw things away

10:42.559 --> 10:44.015
and clean up the clutter.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.393
Now I can't bear to part with any of it.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.062
There's a lot of history here.

10:49.941 --> 10:53.150
Not just the family's, either,
but Scotland's as well.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.319
The college here in lnverness have asked me

10:56.406 --> 10:58.363
to donate his library to their archives.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.900
I'm not sure I'll donate everything.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.577
He was quite fond of several rare editions

11:04.664 --> 11:07.326
of Prince Charles Stuart
and the Battle of Culloden.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.326
Culloden.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.538
Final battle Of the '45.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.168
My ancestors fought and died there, actually.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.466
Really?

11:22.557 --> 11:25.595
Yes, my true name's Roger MacKenzie.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.849
My parents were
Jerry and Marjorie MacKenzie.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.109
The Reverend adopted me
after they were killed in World War ll.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.361
MacKenzie.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.908
I used to know quite a few MacKenzies...

11:43.453 --> 11:44.989
Once upon a time.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.195
It's a common name here.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.245
May I ask you something personal?

11:59.427 --> 12:00.713
How did you do it?

12:05.475 --> 12:07.386
Finally say good-bye

12:10.188 --> 12:13.726
to that one person
you loved most in all the world?

12:21.074 --> 12:24.317
Truth is, I've never been
very good at saying good-bye,

12:26.246 --> 12:27.987
but that's the hell of it, isn't it?

12:30.124 --> 12:32.832
Whether you want to say good-bye or not,

12:34.087 --> 12:35.873
they're gone,

12:39.050 --> 12:41.087
and you have to go on living without them.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.134
Because that's what they would want.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.908
Thank you for the whisky.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.904
Good night, Roger.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.615
God, you are so like him.

14:10.141 --> 14:14.180
I tell you, the army is not ready
for battle this day.

14:14.896 --> 14:18.014
We must retreat to safer ground
before the British realise their advantage

14:18.107 --> 14:19.848
and destroy us all.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.105
You are my Thomas.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.734
It was the Apostle Thomas

14:30.828 --> 14:33.411
who doubted the Lord
who had risen from the dead...

14:36.876 --> 14:38.662
Not until he felt the wounds,

14:38.753 --> 14:41.996
pressed his fingers where the nails had been.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.455
The Lord said to him,

14:43.549 --> 14:46.587
"Because you have seen, you believe,

14:46.844 --> 14:49.711
"but blessed are those
who have not seen and yet believe."

14:54.018 --> 14:55.804
But today is the day, James.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.891
And mark me, before this day is over,

14:58.981 --> 15:01.222
I will make a believer of you.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.490
It's a blessing

15:12.787 --> 15:14.824
Colum didn't live to see this dark day.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.326
It's the Prince.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.035
The Battle of Culloden will happen today,

15:21.129 --> 15:22.494
just as history foretold.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.455
Sentries have spotted the advance guard
four miles out.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.665
Cumberland has broken camp.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.294
His army is marching on the south side
of Kildrummie Moss.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.007
Go inside.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.509
Inform Lord George.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.558
There's only one thing left.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.843
One possibility.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.020
What's that?

15:42.775 --> 15:43.936
Not here.

16:18.686 --> 16:19.972
Fort William.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.803
Built in the 1600s.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.603
The Gaelic name for it is <i>An</i> Gearastan <i>Dubh,</i>

16:25.693 --> 16:27.730
"The Black Garrison."

16:28.196 --> 16:31.780
It was used by the British
as a command post and prison,

16:31.866 --> 16:33.948
intended to control the "savage clans

16:34.035 --> 16:35.901
"and the roving barbarians."

16:35.995 --> 16:38.828
Military history isn't really my speciality.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.494
It was your father's, though, right?

16:43.628 --> 16:46.290
The Reverend has a couple of his books
in the library.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.084
One of my earliest
memories is dropping an ice cream cone

16:52.178 --> 16:54.670
off the ramparts of Fort Ticonderoga,

16:54.764 --> 16:57.222
while he held forth
on the heroics of Ethan Allen

16:57.308 --> 16:59.049
and the Green Mountain Boys.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.508
Ethan Allen?

17:01.229 --> 17:03.766
"I regret I have but one life to give..."

17:03.856 --> 17:04.891
Nathan Hale.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.144
Common mistake.

17:08.861 --> 17:13.105
Never quote American history
to an American.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.942
The Revolutionary War
is practically a religious text in Boston.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.117
With George Washington as the Messiah

17:19.372 --> 17:22.329
and Benedict Arnold as Judas, no doubt.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.788
Benedict Arnold is
a deeply misunderstood historical figure.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.711
I thought you didn't like military history.

17:29.257 --> 17:32.545
We Randalls are a verra
complicated clan, laddie.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.251
That is absolutely

17:35.721 --> 17:38.679
the worst accent I have ever heard.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.855
Do you remember my father very well?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.315
Bits and pieces.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.110
He was a snappy dresser.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.694
Wore his hat down over one eye,
very dashing,

17:57.201 --> 17:58.236
and...

17:59.412 --> 18:00.823
Seemed very kind.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.612
He was.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.289
The kindest man in the world.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.869
Your mother seems very kind as well.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.336
My mother lives in another world.

18:18.389 --> 18:19.629
This place gives me the chills.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.464
With good reason.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.347
Many Scottish prisoners were flogged here.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.346
A lot of blood was spilled on this ground.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.378
<i>My father built this place, ye ken.</i>

19:37.843 --> 19:41.006
<i>His blood and sweat are in this stone.</i>

19:41.972 --> 19:43.838
<i>Are you playing with the apples?</i>

19:43.933 --> 19:45.844
<i>What's your name?</i>

19:45.935 --> 19:47.517
<i>This is my wee Jamie.</i>

19:47.603 --> 19:49.685
<i>This is your uncle, mo chfldhe,
the one you're named after.</i>

19:51.649 --> 19:54.983
<i>Congratulations, your bonny little lass...</i>

19:56.612 --> 19:58.774
<i>Little Margaret Ellen Murray.</i>

19:58.864 --> 20:00.354
<i>'Twas my grandmother's name.</i>

20:00.449 --> 20:02.781
<i>Claire, Claire, they're ready.</i>

20:02.868 --> 20:05.451
<i>- They're giant.
- Oh, my goodness.</i>

20:05.538 --> 20:07.779
<i>You were right, telling us to plant them.</i>

20:07.873 --> 20:10.080
<i>I'm beginning to feel like...</i>

20:10.167 --> 20:12.033
<i>I actually belong here.</i>

20:12.670 --> 20:15.002
<i>I knew ye belonged here with me,</i>

20:15.089 --> 20:17.501
<i>since the first time I laid eyes on ye.</i>

20:20.970 --> 20:23.587
<i>"Come and let us live, my Dear,</i>

20:23.681 --> 20:26.048
<i>"Let us love and never fear."</i>

20:26.559 --> 20:29.392
<i>"Then let amorous kisses dwell</i>

20:30.062 --> 20:32.770
<i>"on our lips, begin and tell</i>

20:33.816 --> 20:36.228
<i>"a Thousand and a Hundred, score,</i>

20:37.153 --> 20:40.316
<i>"a Hundred, and a Thousand more."</i>

21:15.691 --> 21:17.932
This battle, this war...

21:18.027 --> 21:19.813
Everything that's about to happen,

21:19.904 --> 21:21.190
it all depends on Charles.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.404
Aye.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.908
And what if he were to die...

21:27.995 --> 21:29.076
Now?

21:30.206 --> 21:31.287
Right now.

21:31.582 --> 21:33.118
Then the battle wouldn't happen,

21:33.209 --> 21:35.075
and this whole bloody
rebellion would die with him.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.208
Christ.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.794
I have this.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.339
It's yellow jasmine, and it's poisonous.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.137
It's what Colum took last night.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.259
<i>Comm'?</i>

21:50.142 --> 21:51.724
He begged me.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.301
He knew that his time was near.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.552
He took his own life?

21:54.897 --> 21:56.604
Claire, that's a mortal sin.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.432
He wanted a quick and peaceful death,

21:59.527 --> 22:00.858
and I gave it to him.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.983
Charles has been suffering
with scurvy for weeks,

22:04.073 --> 22:06.314
and I've been treating him
regularly with tinctures.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.903
I could put this in a tea.

22:09.954 --> 22:13.288
Kill Charles Stuart?

22:21.674 --> 22:23.415
The way it works

22:24.426 --> 22:26.793
it would be like drifting into a deep sleep.

22:30.391 --> 22:31.973
And he would never know?

22:32.935 --> 22:34.801
No one would ever know.

22:41.986 --> 22:45.229
Do you have any memory
of an incident that happened

22:45.322 --> 22:47.029
with my parents when they were here?

22:47.950 --> 22:49.691
How do you mean, "incident"?

22:49.785 --> 22:51.116
Something big that happened between them

22:51.203 --> 22:53.114
when they were here staying with your father.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.695
I was just a wee lad.

22:59.003 --> 23:01.665
I don't remember all the details,

23:04.383 --> 23:08.547
but I do recall finding Mrs Graham
crying out in the tool shed.

23:10.973 --> 23:13.089
There were a lot
of broken things lying about,

23:13.183 --> 23:15.845
and I think she said
your father had lost his temper

23:15.936 --> 23:17.267
and smashed everything up.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.970
My father smashed...

23:19.064 --> 23:20.896
Yes, but that wasn't
the reason why she was crying,

23:20.983 --> 23:22.223
I'm certain of that.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.605
My father definitely had a temper,

23:24.695 --> 23:27.027
but he kept it tightly under wraps.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.148
When did this happen? What year?

23:30.743 --> 23:33.906
Your mother said I was seven or eight
when she last saw me,

23:35.039 --> 23:37.406
so it must have been 1947 or '48.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.468
My father kept this

23:51.597 --> 23:54.885
lockbox on the top shelf of his closet.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.602
I knew where he hid the key,

24:00.981 --> 24:02.471
so one day, I opened it.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.808
There were letters in there from your father.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.860
Mostly academic stuff,

24:09.782 --> 24:11.443
but there was this one letter.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.869
The Reverend mentioned an incident

24:16.956 --> 24:19.072
involving my mother and my father,

24:19.500 --> 24:21.082
and the way he phrased it

24:21.168 --> 24:23.535
made me feel like it was something big,

24:23.629 --> 24:24.835
maybe something terrible.

24:24.922 --> 24:27.710
Definitely something he didn't want
to spell out on paper.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.379
It scared me for some reason.

24:32.680 --> 24:36.264
I put the letter back in the box, locked it,

24:36.350 --> 24:38.182
and never looked at it again.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.387
My father kept a journal.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.728
He wrote in it every night after supper.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.604
There's boxes of them in the storage room,

24:47.695 --> 24:49.481
if you wouldn't mind getting a bit grubby.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.446
Grubby doesn't bother me.
You should see my bedroom.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.449
That didn't come out right.

24:56.578 --> 24:59.036
No, no, but I...

24:59.665 --> 25:00.905
I get your meaning.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.847
So I've traced the chain of title

26:03.937 --> 26:07.726
for the estate known as
Lallybroch or Broch Tuarach

26:07.816 --> 26:09.807
and found this.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.815
It's the earliest document
we have in our files,

26:12.905 --> 26:15.988
a deed of sasine,
transferring title to the property

26:16.075 --> 26:20.114
from James Alexander
Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser

26:20.204 --> 26:23.071
to James Jacob Fraser Murray.

26:23.165 --> 26:27.033
The property was transferred in 1745,

26:27.127 --> 26:30.210
witnessed by Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser

26:30.297 --> 26:32.664
and Claire Beauchamp...

26:33.133 --> 26:36.546
Well, it's a bit smudged,
but I think her surname's Fraser as well.

26:40.974 --> 26:42.135
Yes...

26:44.895 --> 26:46.056
I believe it was.

26:47.648 --> 26:50.310
And after that?

26:50.484 --> 26:51.895
Various Murrays, it seems.

26:51.985 --> 26:55.444
The property stayed in that family
for many generations.

26:55.781 --> 26:59.649
I've made you a copy,
so this one is yours to keep.

27:00.828 --> 27:01.863
Thank you.

27:03.831 --> 27:05.538
One last thing.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.036
Is it possible to do a genealogical search?

27:08.168 --> 27:09.658
Aye, what's the name?

27:10.170 --> 27:11.660
Roger MacKenzie.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.503
How was your date?

27:17.010 --> 27:18.626
It wasn't a date.

27:19.805 --> 27:23.639
Well, you have to admit
he is rather handsome and intelligent.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.676
Not to mention, he has a lovely physique.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.431
Who says "physique"?

27:29.064 --> 27:30.304
Stop.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.016
Of course, there are those deep blue eyes.

27:34.695 --> 27:35.810
Maybe you should date him.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.229
So where did you end up going?

27:38.657 --> 27:39.692
Fort William.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.448
Have you been?

27:45.289 --> 27:46.370
Once.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.248
Didn't much care for the place.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.827
So what did you do today?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.756
I just puttered around the village.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.175
Places you and Daddy went before?

28:01.305 --> 28:02.386
Some.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.302
Do you miss him?

28:13.442 --> 28:14.648
Of course.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.857
Sometimes it doesn't seem like you do,

28:19.948 --> 28:21.063
OF...

28:21.575 --> 28:22.986
You ever loved him.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.578
What a thing to say.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.415
Well, did you?

28:32.294 --> 28:33.329
Love him?

28:36.423 --> 28:37.458
I did.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.306
Make no mistake,

28:56.318 --> 28:58.980
this would be cold-blooded murder

28:59.112 --> 29:00.147
you would be carrying out.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.401
To stop a slaughter.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.986
If we kill the Prince, we take one life

29:05.077 --> 29:06.112
to save thousands.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.160
Jamie.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.238
Lord George requests
yer presence near the east dyke.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.368
Ye're to come at once.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.075
They're calling the men to form lines.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.375
AYE, on my way.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.252
We would need to move quickly.

29:21.969 --> 29:24.586
I could put this in his tea
now and give it to him.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.638
Ye ungrateful son of a bastard.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.348
You filthy, whoring witch.

29:43.991 --> 29:46.824
I'm meeting the curator on the second floor.

29:46.910 --> 29:47.945
I shouldn't be long,

29:48.078 --> 29:52.493
then we can go start the great excavation
of the Reverend's journals.

29:53.083 --> 29:56.621
- Will you be okay?
- Yeah, sure, I'll hang out.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.026
And we can no longer allow

30:22.612 --> 30:25.195
their vision to dictate ours.

30:25.282 --> 30:28.570
When Scotland was united with England
under a single crown,

30:28.660 --> 30:31.072
it was the beginning of the end for us.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.370
We lost more than our independence.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.740
We lost our spirit.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.961
The government in Westminster,

30:41.048 --> 30:42.413
the bankers in the City,

30:42.507 --> 30:44.714
the newspapers of Fleet Street

30:45.135 --> 30:47.547
have stolen our money.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.504
Our voices,

30:51.516 --> 30:52.881
our futures.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.312
Where are the rulers of old

31:00.317 --> 31:03.309
who knew how to look after their people?

31:05.280 --> 31:08.238
The kings who have become legendary...

31:08.367 --> 31:09.949
Arthur of Wales,

31:10.327 --> 31:12.193
Richard the Lionheart,

31:12.871 --> 31:15.112
Prince Charles Edward Stuart...

31:17.084 --> 31:18.540
Our Bonnie Prince.

31:19.044 --> 31:22.378
We've all heard of the Battle of Culloden.

31:25.133 --> 31:30.094
But imagine how different
Scotland would be now

31:30.180 --> 31:33.138
if we had won.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.603
Where is our Bonnie Prince Charlie today?

31:44.820 --> 31:47.562
I am...

31:47.656 --> 31:49.317
Bonnie Prince Charlie.

31:49.491 --> 31:50.697
Yes.

31:50.784 --> 31:53.367
You are Bonnie Prince Charlie.

31:53.453 --> 31:54.784
Yes.

31:54.871 --> 31:58.239
We are Bonnie Prince Charlie.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.741
Aye. Scotland!

32:01.420 --> 32:02.626
Scotland!

32:02.712 --> 32:04.453
Scotland! Scotland!

32:04.548 --> 32:06.505
- Scotland!
- Scotland!

32:11.471 --> 32:12.802
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.425
Cheers, and take that.

32:14.516 --> 32:15.551
Yes, thanks.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.973
I liked your speech,

32:17.060 --> 32:20.928
but wasn't it the Scottish king,
James VI who united the crowns?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.556
And Queen Anne,
his Scottish granddaughter,

32:23.650 --> 32:25.186
who signed the Acts of Union?

32:25.610 --> 32:26.691
Aye,

32:26.778 --> 32:28.769
but Anne was raised Anglican,

32:28.864 --> 32:31.947
already under the influence of Westminster.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.491
Prince Charles and his father King James

32:34.619 --> 32:36.075
wanted to undo all that.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.951
Sounds like they would've been
just trading one king for another.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.997
Charles was Catholic and a Scot.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.416
Unlike German Geordie and the Hanovers,

32:43.837 --> 32:45.669
his loyalty was to us.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.334
Maybe.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.502
You're an American.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.132
Are you a student here?

32:51.595 --> 32:53.427
Brianna Randall. Just visiting.

32:54.764 --> 32:57.051
So, why are you here?

32:57.851 --> 32:59.057
I'm a history student.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.055
I like watching history being made.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.602
There you are.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.180
Roger Wakefield.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.645
Gillian Edgars.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.323
There's another big rally later, near here.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.486
We'll be making history.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.494
Cheers.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.179
Tall fellow, wasn't he?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.687
Wasn't that tall in real life.

33:47.567 --> 33:48.682
He could have been great.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.769
He had the name, the cause,

33:51.863 --> 33:55.197
the support of good men
willing to lay down their lives for him.

33:57.202 --> 34:00.695
They've taken a fool, turned him into a hero.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.956
And what's that thing inside there?

34:10.465 --> 34:12.047
Not sure.

34:12.132 --> 34:14.465
Looks like a dragonfly, maybe?

34:27.732 --> 34:30.393
Dougal. It's not what ye think, man.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.400
No? Not what I think?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.152
What, that

34:35.239 --> 34:37.982
that woman was urging ye to foul murder,

34:39.327 --> 34:40.487
the murder of your prince.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.069
- No.
- Dougal, you have to listen...

34:42.163 --> 34:43.402
Shut your mouth.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.326
I kent you were a traitor
the first time I clapped eyes on ye.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.455
Easy now.

34:51.922 --> 34:54.335
Ye see, Jamie,

34:55.927 --> 34:58.294
ye place yer trust in someone, ye know?

34:59.264 --> 35:01.426
And ye give into them,

35:02.601 --> 35:05.844
ye give into them
with your heart and your soul,

35:05.937 --> 35:09.475
and for you to then plan the murder
of our beloved prince...

35:09.608 --> 35:10.939
- No, Dougal...
- Christ.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.816
Christ.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.188
I'd rather be hung, drawn, and quartered.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.443
I would.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.319
Jamie.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.402
Ye've just, ye've betrayed us, you know?

35:23.496 --> 35:25.453
Ye have. All of us.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.452
Your people.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.958
And worse than that,

35:30.337 --> 35:31.702
ye've betrayed Scotland herself.

35:31.796 --> 35:32.831
No.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.710
And you. You're nothing

35:36.343 --> 35:37.925
but a lying slut,

35:38.011 --> 35:40.469
who would lead a man
by the cock to his doom,

35:40.555 --> 35:43.343
with your claws sunk deep into his bollocks.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.057
Claire is my wife.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.056
Ye'll no speak ill of her, even in your anger.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.307
Anger?

35:51.733 --> 35:52.894
Anger?

35:53.318 --> 35:54.353
Oh, no.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.352
What ye've done to me...

35:56.488 --> 35:57.569
We're past anger.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.112
You're tired, Dougal.

35:59.199 --> 36:00.815
Cold and hungry.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.153
Leave now.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.325
No!

36:08.917 --> 36:10.157
Claire.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.576
Jamie, come to me

36:12.671 --> 36:14.662
and I'll kill you quick for your mother's sake.

36:14.756 --> 36:16.246
Dougal, we can talk this through.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.705
Just stay down. Just stay.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.264
I'm so sorry, Uncle.

38:08.495 --> 38:10.611
How long since anyone's been in this place?

38:11.289 --> 38:12.529
Ages, I expect.

38:16.503 --> 38:17.709
Are these his journals?

38:21.966 --> 38:23.456
Aye.

38:23.551 --> 38:27.135
Aye, if there's anything here
about what happened back in 1948,

38:27.555 --> 38:28.886
we should be able to find it.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.133
What was that?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.556
Probably a rat.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.304
Here, use that.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.894
At least you won't be taken by surprise.

38:41.528 --> 38:42.814
Too late for that.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.897
Would you rather I did a rat satire?

38:45.990 --> 38:47.196
A what?

38:48.326 --> 38:49.487
A rat satire.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.656
An old Scottish custom.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.579
If you had rats in your house,

38:54.666 --> 38:56.407
you could make them go away
by singing to them

38:56.501 --> 38:58.242
and telling them how poor the eating was

38:58.336 --> 39:00.543
where they were and how good
it was elsewhere.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.086
You're kidding, right?

39:03.007 --> 39:04.793
<i>Ye rats</i>

39:04.884 --> 39:06.420
<i>Ye are too many</i>

39:06.511 --> 39:08.377
<i>If ye would dine aplenty</i>

39:08.513 --> 39:10.754
<i>Ye must go
ye must go</i>

39:11.057 --> 39:12.388
<i>Go and fill your bellies</i>

39:12.517 --> 39:14.929
<i>Dinna stay and
gnaw my Wellies</i>

39:15.019 --> 39:18.683
<i>Go, ye rats, go</i>

39:19.440 --> 39:20.521
You just made that up.

39:20.608 --> 39:21.939
Obviously.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.435
Any good rat satire must always be...

39:26.865 --> 39:28.196
Original.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.949
Well, after that performance,

39:31.035 --> 39:33.367
there shouldn't be a rat
within miles of this place.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.249
Randall.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.716
Now there's an heirloom for you.

39:49.762 --> 39:53.426
A letter of commission in the army,
signed by His Royal Majesty,

39:53.558 --> 39:55.048
King George ll.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.558
Dated 1735.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.930
"Jonathan Wolverton Randall."

40:02.275 --> 40:04.482
I remember Daddy talking about him.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.230
He's one of our ancestors.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.568
Here's a letter from your father.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.581
The Reverend was doing research
on the Captain

40:21.753 --> 40:24.541
and my father told him
to abandon the project.

40:24.631 --> 40:26.338
"He's not the man I thought."

40:27.008 --> 40:28.089
Odd.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.337
Then let's take these boxes into the library.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.433
Oh, God. Oh, Christ.

40:38.603 --> 40:39.638
Rupert.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.011
I'd have torn out my one good eye

40:41.105 --> 40:42.937
if it could have stopped me seeing this.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.765
But seen it I have.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.600
Aye, ye have.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.110
Wait.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.317
There's one service I ask of you.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.530
Give me two hours.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.742
There are some things I need to tend to.

40:59.832 --> 41:00.947
Ye understand?

41:05.296 --> 41:06.331
And then?

41:06.464 --> 41:09.172
And then I'll come back
and answer for what I have done.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.712
I give ye my word.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.634
Two hours.

41:13.846 --> 41:16.463
Grant me that, before ye speak.

41:18.142 --> 41:21.806
For the memory of the friendship
that I once had for you,

41:22.647 --> 41:26.811
which you have now murdered
as certainly as you did my chieftain...

41:28.319 --> 41:30.185
I'll give ye two hours,

41:31.155 --> 41:34.398
and then I'll damn your soul to the fiery pit.

41:48.506 --> 41:52.044
<i>You can see how flat
and open and boggy it is.</i>

41:52.176 --> 41:54.008
<i>The Highland army was completely exposed,</i>

41:54.095 --> 41:57.508
<i>and they then charged
into the teeth of musket fire,</i>

41:57.598 --> 41:59.134
<i>cannons, mortars.</i>

41:59.225 --> 42:01.091
<i>And it was very, very quick</i>

42:01.185 --> 42:02.550
<i>and very bloody.</i>

42:02.687 --> 42:04.177
<i>In effect,</i>

42:04.272 --> 42:06.764
<i>Culloden marked the end of the clans</i>

42:07.191 --> 42:09.683
<i>and the end of the Highlander way of life.</i>

42:19.704 --> 42:21.069
Are you a Fraser?

42:24.917 --> 42:26.032
Yes.

42:26.544 --> 42:27.705
I am.

42:48.941 --> 42:52.650
I swore I'd never set foot on this horrid place,

42:54.238 --> 42:55.569
but here I am.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.607
And you're here too.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.159
Or your bones, at least.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.114
I'm not going to cry.

43:07.919 --> 43:09.785
Because you wouldn't want that,

43:10.671 --> 43:12.161
and besides...

43:16.094 --> 43:18.085
I've come with good news.

43:22.642 --> 43:25.760
You have a daughter, Brianna.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.350
Named after your father,

43:31.859 --> 43:33.600
just as I promised.

43:43.329 --> 43:44.694
Jamie, I...

43:46.124 --> 43:47.865
Was angry a'! Yo“

43:49.627 --> 43:51.459
for such a long time.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.874
You made me go and live a life

43:59.303 --> 44:01.169
that I didn't want to live.

44:02.807 --> 44:04.548
But you were right,

44:05.143 --> 44:06.383
damn you.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.685
Brianna was safe

44:14.819 --> 44:16.150
andloved

44:16.737 --> 44:18.193
and raised well.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.563
But sometimes,

44:21.701 --> 44:26.320
when she turns and the light
catches her red hair

44:28.666 --> 44:30.998
or I see her smile in her sleep,

44:33.087 --> 44:35.169
it takes my breath away.

44:37.717 --> 44:39.378
Because I see you.

44:45.183 --> 44:46.719
She was born

44:47.518 --> 44:48.758
7215,

44:49.395 --> 44:51.727
on a rainy Boston morning.

44:56.777 --> 44:58.688
And that's everything.

45:00.781 --> 45:02.363
Everything I can remember.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.237
See? No tears.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.695
Bet you didn't think I could do that, did you?

45:19.967 --> 45:23.460
That day at Craigh na Dun...

45:26.224 --> 45:27.885
We said a lot of things,

45:28.935 --> 45:32.644
but there was one thing I didn't say.

45:33.814 --> 45:35.100
Couldn't.

45:38.319 --> 45:39.605
Ihaven%

45:40.404 --> 45:41.735
for 20 years.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.488
But I'm here,

45:50.122 --> 45:51.783
and now it's time.

45:59.757 --> 46:03.091
Good-bye, Jamie Fraser.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.304
My love.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.489
Rest easy, soldier.

46:50.141 --> 46:51.552
"Kidnapped by the Fairies?"

46:53.894 --> 46:55.134
"Claire Randall,

46:55.229 --> 46:57.812
"wife of noted historian Frank Randall...

46:57.982 --> 47:00.519
"Holiday in lnverness. Car found.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.483
"Police thought she was possibly murdered."

47:03.154 --> 47:04.565
Well, obviously not. She turned up.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.191
Three years later.

47:06.324 --> 47:07.610
"Mysteriously found wandering,

47:07.700 --> 47:10.567
"dressed in rags, disoriented, incoherent."

47:10.661 --> 47:12.402
I think we've found your incident.

47:14.332 --> 47:16.289
What about the Reverend's journal?

47:16.375 --> 47:18.082
Maybe he says more about this.

47:18.169 --> 47:19.910
Are you sure you want to do this?

47:20.546 --> 47:22.082
You may not like what you find.

47:22.214 --> 47:23.830
I want the truth.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.504
No matter what.

47:34.518 --> 47:35.883
There you are.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.931
Would you like some tea?

47:38.022 --> 47:39.638
What I'd like is to know

47:39.732 --> 47:42.019
exactly what you've been doing
the past two days.

47:42.693 --> 47:44.229
As I told you, I've just been...

47:44.362 --> 47:46.194
Puttering around town, collecting herbs.

47:46.739 --> 47:48.195
Is that all?

47:50.034 --> 47:51.820
What's going on, Bree?

47:51.911 --> 47:53.072
Did you see him?

47:54.038 --> 47:55.073
Who?

47:55.539 --> 47:56.870
My father.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.536
Did you see my father?

47:59.877 --> 48:01.663
What kind of question is that to ask?

48:01.754 --> 48:02.789
Not Daddy.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.496
No, he's dead. I know that.

48:04.590 --> 48:06.126
I'm talking about my father,

48:06.217 --> 48:08.504
the man you had an affair with.

48:08.594 --> 48:10.881
The man you were with for three years.

48:32.243 --> 48:33.324
Bree.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.328
It's complicated.

48:42.294 --> 48:44.410
No, it's pretty simple, actually.

48:44.797 --> 48:48.916
Newspapers say your "miraculous return"
was in April 1948.

48:49.468 --> 48:52.426
I was born in November '48.

48:53.681 --> 48:56.594
I did the math, and it turns out
you were three months pregnant

48:56.684 --> 48:59.096
when "the fairies"
brought you back to Daddy.

49:01.605 --> 49:02.845
Bree...

49:03.816 --> 49:06.433
I found something else in
the Reverend's correspondence.

49:06.610 --> 49:08.772
Not sure what it means, but...

49:14.827 --> 49:17.159
- I'm sorry. I should let you...
- No, stay.

49:17.788 --> 49:19.153
It's your house,

49:19.790 --> 49:21.531
and you haven't lied to anyone.

49:26.213 --> 49:27.829
I think we should talk alone.

49:28.132 --> 49:30.464
He's my friend, and he stays.

49:35.514 --> 49:36.845
All right.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.309
But I think you should sit down.

49:57.369 --> 49:58.484
Yes.

50:00.706 --> 50:02.697
There was another man.

50:05.669 --> 50:08.582
And I loved him very much.

50:14.178 --> 50:15.509
And yes

50:17.848 --> 50:19.839
he was your real father.

50:24.522 --> 50:25.762
You lied.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.690
All my life, you've lied to me.

50:30.945 --> 50:33.107
Frank didn't want you to know.

50:33.197 --> 50:35.234
Don't you dare blame this on him.

50:36.951 --> 50:39.363
He wanted to raise you as his own,

50:39.537 --> 50:41.027
and I agreed.

50:41.956 --> 50:44.948
It's why we moved to America.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.326
So we could put all this behind us.

50:48.420 --> 50:50.707
Until you found an excuse to visit Scotland?

50:53.717 --> 50:55.879
Is that really why we're here?

50:55.970 --> 51:00.009
So I could have some kind of
surprise introduction to my real father?

51:00.099 --> 51:01.214
No.

51:06.063 --> 51:08.100
It's not possible, anyway.

51:09.066 --> 51:11.148
Because he has no interest
in meeting his daughter?

51:15.447 --> 51:17.063
Because he's dead.

51:17.241 --> 51:21.075
I promised Frank
I wouldn't tell you about him,

51:22.454 --> 51:24.240
so for 20 years, I...

51:26.500 --> 51:28.582
I haven't uttered his name out loud.

51:32.756 --> 51:34.338
But now you know,

51:36.510 --> 51:38.421
and I need to tell you about him.

51:43.475 --> 51:45.466
About your real father...

51:48.272 --> 51:49.603
Jamie Fraser.

51:52.484 --> 51:54.771
I don't want to know anything about him.

51:55.821 --> 51:57.607
Not one single thing.

51:58.866 --> 52:00.527
Bree. Brianna.

52:01.535 --> 52:03.947
You told me you just wanted
the truth, no matter what.

52:04.955 --> 52:06.116
This is it.

52:23.307 --> 52:24.968
Most important...

52:27.394 --> 52:29.806
Jamie loved you

52:30.314 --> 52:31.520
very much.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.807
Even though he never met you,

52:35.694 --> 52:37.731
he loved you with all his heart.

52:39.031 --> 52:41.318
And he would have raised you...

52:47.164 --> 52:48.905
Well, if it wasn't...

52:54.338 --> 52:55.828
If it wasn't

52:56.757 --> 52:59.215
for the Battle of Culloden.

52:59.551 --> 53:01.383
I've killed Dougal MacKenzie.

53:05.265 --> 53:07.006
Couldn't say I'm that surprised,

53:07.685 --> 53:09.016
only that it took ye so long.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.385
What's to do, then?

53:23.033 --> 53:24.194
What is it?

53:24.284 --> 53:25.445
A deed of sasine.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.785
It conveys the title of Lallybroch

53:27.871 --> 53:29.453
to James Jacob Fraser Murray.

53:29.540 --> 53:30.951
Giving the place over to your nephew.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.122
Aye.

53:32.209 --> 53:33.370
This protects Lallybroch

53:33.460 --> 53:34.791
and keeps the estate in the family,

53:34.878 --> 53:36.209
safe from the Crown,

53:36.296 --> 53:37.786
to be held in trust by Jenny and Ian

53:37.881 --> 53:39.246
until Wee Jamie is old enough.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.674
But it's dated from a year ago.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.376
Aye, before the rebellion, before...

53:44.763 --> 53:46.049
I was a traitor.

53:46.807 --> 53:48.798
I just need the signature of two witnesses.

53:48.892 --> 53:50.724
Go fetch your master ink and a quill, lad.

53:50.936 --> 53:52.222
Quick about it. Go.

53:55.232 --> 53:56.393
Will ye have me take it to Jenny?

53:56.483 --> 53:57.644
No, I'll have Fergus take it.

53:58.986 --> 54:00.568
- Me, milord?
- Aye.

54:00.904 --> 54:02.110
Aye, you're to ride to Lallybroch.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.239
Ye'll leave now.

54:08.412 --> 54:10.653
This must reach Madam Murray without fail.

54:10.748 --> 54:13.740
It is worth more than my life or yours.

54:14.251 --> 54:15.662
I don't want to leave you, milord.

54:16.670 --> 54:18.126
- I refuse.
- Ye must.

54:18.964 --> 54:21.956
Not just for the deed,
but no matter what happens here today,

54:22.092 --> 54:23.753
it's important someone remembers.

54:24.344 --> 54:25.584
You understand?

54:27.931 --> 54:29.342
I will not fail you, milord.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.091
I know ye won't.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.689
So how long have you been
cooking up this story?

54:45.282 --> 54:46.613
No, I...

54:46.700 --> 54:49.863
I know this must sound crazy, but...

54:49.953 --> 54:53.446
Did you really think
I would swallow this fairy tale?

54:54.333 --> 54:56.199
Do you think I'm still five years old?

54:58.295 --> 55:00.411
It is not a fairy tale, Bree.

55:00.506 --> 55:03.669
The man I grew up with,
who loved me for 20 years,

55:03.801 --> 55:05.212
isn't my father.

55:05.302 --> 55:06.884
My real father

55:06.970 --> 55:09.507
is some 6'3" redheaded guy in a kilt

55:09.640 --> 55:12.974
from the 18th century?
What is wrong with you?

55:13.227 --> 55:16.185
Listen to me. Frank was your father

55:16.313 --> 55:18.304
in every way that matters

55:19.316 --> 55:20.647
except one.

55:23.028 --> 55:24.314
He didn't make you.

55:26.323 --> 55:27.905
Jamie and I did.

55:29.993 --> 55:31.825
You're just like him.

55:32.579 --> 55:34.661
Your hair, your mannerisms.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.411
Oh, he would have loved you
and raised you if...

55:38.502 --> 55:41.290
If it hadn't been for the Battle of Culloden?

55:41.380 --> 55:42.836
Oh, my God, stop.

55:42.923 --> 55:44.254
It's true.

55:44.341 --> 55:45.502
Here.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.333
Look at this.

55:48.720 --> 55:49.835
Here.

55:50.681 --> 55:51.921
The deed to Lallybroch.

55:53.517 --> 55:55.133
Claire Beauchamp Fraser.

55:55.227 --> 55:56.934
It's my maiden name, my signature.

55:57.020 --> 55:58.226
Just admit it!

55:58.355 --> 56:01.598
Admit that you are not a perfect person.

56:01.692 --> 56:04.104
Own up to the fact
that you fucked someone else

56:04.194 --> 56:05.434
while you were married to Daddy,

56:05.529 --> 56:07.440
just like a million other bored housewives.

56:07.531 --> 56:09.818
I was not bored, and what Jamie and I had

56:09.908 --> 56:11.490
was a hell of a lot more than fucking.

56:11.577 --> 56:13.693
He was the love of my life!

56:21.211 --> 56:23.122
Why are you doing this?

56:26.425 --> 56:27.756
Bree, I...

56:28.802 --> 56:30.292
I'm doing this

56:31.763 --> 56:33.219
because it's the truth.

56:36.935 --> 56:39.393
Only two people know
what the truth really is,

56:41.064 --> 56:42.304
and one of them is dead.

56:46.278 --> 56:48.144
Too bad it wasn't you.

57:04.421 --> 57:07.959
You stop for nothing, except to sleep.

57:08.133 --> 57:10.090
And if you do, hide yourself well.

57:16.099 --> 57:18.466
You're a soldier now, mon fils.

57:19.144 --> 57:20.634
I love you like a son.

57:24.441 --> 57:26.023
Like our own son.

57:59.977 --> 58:01.559
That doesn't mean anything.

58:01.645 --> 58:03.682
I don't know what it means, to be honest,

58:03.814 --> 58:05.805
but the Reverend obviously
thought it meant something.

58:05.983 --> 58:07.473
She's insane.

58:07.567 --> 58:09.308
That's all that matters.

58:09.403 --> 58:12.236
Now, don't lash out at me,

58:12.864 --> 58:15.151
but that deed of sasine did look authentic.

58:16.493 --> 58:20.612
So some woman back in 17-whatever

58:20.706 --> 58:22.322
had the same name as she does,

58:22.499 --> 58:24.081
or she read about someone

58:24.167 --> 58:25.703
and is fantasising it was her own life.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.581
Or what if there's

58:28.672 --> 58:30.162
something to her story?

58:30.882 --> 58:33.169
Keep that up and I mightjust
lash out at you after all.

58:33.260 --> 58:35.217
Now, look, you told me

58:35.387 --> 58:37.173
that you could never
get close to your mother,

58:37.681 --> 58:39.467
that she lived in another world.

58:39.558 --> 58:41.890
Well, maybe she's trying
to show you that world.

58:42.728 --> 58:44.218
So you believe she travelled

58:44.354 --> 58:46.015
200 years into the past?

58:48.025 --> 58:49.265
Through a stone?

58:49.359 --> 58:51.771
It's not important if I believe it.

58:51.862 --> 58:52.897
She believes it.

58:55.615 --> 58:57.197
I'm just saying,

58:57.951 --> 59:00.033
maybe we should keep an open mind.

59:02.372 --> 59:03.862
How 'bout we keep an open tab instead?

59:25.395 --> 59:29.138
<i>There were ghosts around me everywhere
since I'd arrived.</i>

59:29.316 --> 59:31.057
<i>The face was unmistakable,</i>

59:31.902 --> 59:33.563
<i>Geillis Duncan.</i>

59:33.987 --> 59:36.445
<i>I remembered the date
she'd told me at the trial,</i>

59:37.074 --> 59:39.281
<i>the year she came through the stones.</i>

59:39.409 --> 59:41.116
<i>1968.</i>

59:42.120 --> 59:43.610
<i>This was no ghost.</i>

59:43.830 --> 59:45.616
<i>Geillis was here,</i>

59:45.749 --> 59:48.787
<i>a younger version of her, but she was here.</i>

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:32.577
Hello, I'm looking for Gillian Edgars.

01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:34.253
Is this her residence?

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:35.454
Aye.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.630
And what is it you want with her?

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:39.799
Well, I'm an old friend of Gillian's,

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.714
Claire Randall.

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:42.886
You must be...

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.134
Greg.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:45.843
Her husband.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:01.318
I'm not going to be in the area long.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.856
Do you know where she might be?

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.026
I'd love to say hello.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:06.197
Aye.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:09.575
She will likely be with the Roses, but l...

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.327
I've no kept up.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.671
The Roses?

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.170
The White Roses of Scotland?

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:23.335
Aye.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:26.346
Aye, bloody Nationalists.

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:32.178
She spends all her time
down the Institute, day and night,

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:34.722
spendin' all my money on courses.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.020
Folklore, they call it.

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:42.859
She filled up a million
notebooks with her findings.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.488
Why not just learn to type?

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:48.615
Get a job if she's bored,

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.571
that's what I told her.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.581
So she left.

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.705
It's been weeks now.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:11.054
So you say she's been gone for weeks?

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.430
Aye.

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:15.554
That's what I said.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.061
Like...

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:20.942
If ye do see Gilly,

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:23.062
tell her to come home, eh?

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:25.571
Tell her I love her.

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:28.571
Of course.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.774
Honestly, this pub's been
here since 1820, and...

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.100
Gillian. Hi.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.106
You missed a great rally earlier.

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:05.980
I'm sorry we missed it.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.948
Roger and I are just having a whisky.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:11.486
Aye. It's been a bit of a tricky day.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:13.366
My mother's insane.

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.869
A sentiment echoed
by daughters everywhere.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:18.617
Maybe I'll catch you again at the next rally.

01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:21.962
Afraid I'm leaving tonight to...

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.132
Further the cause.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.132
But don't stop asking the hard questions.

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:31.300
That's the way the world changes.

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:41.975
<i>For hours I read Geillis' notebooks.</i>

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:45.356
<i>I tried to make sense
of the convoluted pages.</i>

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:48.105
<i>They contained formulas
about the art and science</i>

01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:49.234
<i>of time travel.</i>

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:54.532
<i>Unlike myself, Geillis had studied
and prepared for her journey.</i>

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:59.583
<i>I was stunned to learn she believed
you must have a human sacrifice</i>

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:04.209
<i>to move through the stones,
and gemstones to protect and guide you.</i>

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.044
<i>From what I could tell,</i>

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:11.171
<i>Geillis planned to pass through
Craigh na Dun, and soon.</i>

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:14.006
<i>Sadly, I knew how that trip would end,</i>

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:17.972
<i>with Geillis burned on a pyre in Cranesmuir.</i>

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:19.349
<i>I had to try and stop her.</i>

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:30.572
Gather the Frasers of Lallybroch together
and get them out of here.

01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:35.828
There'll be pell-mell on the moor,
with troops and horses moving to and fro.

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:38.702
Nobody will try and stop you
with the British in sight

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:40.703
and the battle about to begin.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:45.038
Tell them the order comes from me,
and they'll follow without question.

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:47.213
Lead them off the moor
and away from the battle.

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:50.300
Set them on the road to Lallybroch
and home.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:52.089
Are ye sure?

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:53.720
Aye.

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:57.432
This battle is already lost.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:01.266
No matter how righteous,
it was doomed from the start.

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:04.230
We've done all we could,

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.229
but now it's over.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.061
I'll not have my kin die for nothing.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.823
And what are you to do?

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.077
I'll take Claire to safety.

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.414
Then I'll turn back...

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:25.248
Back to Culloden,

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.998
and fight till it's done.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.433
I'll guide yer men to safety

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.136
and set them on the path home.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.262
But ken this,

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.185
when ye return,

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.350
I'll be waiting here to fight by yer side.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:49.817
No.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:54.114
No, I said I'll not have ye dying for nothing.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:56.529
I won't be.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:00.195
I'll be dying with you.

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:19.806
I don't want to argue.

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:27.685
Let's just agree that I have a father who...

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:31.226
Isn't Daddy.

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:36.448
I don't want to discuss
your whole time travel delusion,

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:38.821
but I do want to know more about this...

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.536
Jamie Fraser.

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:47.997
Tell me about him.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:50.545
Of course.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:54.507
All right.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.180
He was tall

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:05.226
and had red hairjust like yours.

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:12.393
His father's name was Brian,
and that's where your name came from.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.858
He spoke French, and he loved to play chess.

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:21.865
He had a sister, Jenny, who's your aunt...

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.912
It would take too long

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.379
to tell you everything about him.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:39.715
But I promise I will.

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:48.388
Today, I visited his grave on Culloden Moor
and was telling him all about you...

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:49.896
This is the part where you lose me.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:53.229
I didn't intend to fall in love.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.234
In fact, I fought against it.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.901
But I couldn't deny what I felt for him.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:05.904
And I tried,

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:08.907
but I couldn't.

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.670
It was the most powerful thing that I've...

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.127
Ever felt in my life.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:32.935
How is she?

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:36.104
Well, we're talking, at least.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.024
A fair improvement on shouting.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:43.654
Roger, do you know Gillian Edgars?

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.576
Not really.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:48.781
- I know she gave Brianna that at the...
- Brianna's actually met her?

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.365
Yeah.

01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:51.870
Gillian's great.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:57.339
I mean, she's a little crazy on the whole
Scottish nationalist thing, but I liked her.

01:08:57.675 --> 01:08:59.336
Do you know where she is now?

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:01.964
- No. Why?
- Are you sure?

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:04.004
I need to find her. It's important.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:07.136
We just ran into her at the pub.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.345
She said she was leaving town tonight.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.433
Something about going somewhere
to "further the cause."

01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:13.558
Didn't sound like she would be back.

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.939
She's going through the stones.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:19.814
We're not talking about this again.

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:22.694
Gillian Edgars
is Geillis Duncan from the witch trial.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:23.986
This is her.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.943
She is the one who saved my life.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.903
And if I can stop her going
through the stones,

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.828
then perhaps I can do the same for her.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.042
Except I can't.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.587
Why not?

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:40.874
Because of you.

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:42.421
Me?

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:46.759
When you told me that
you were a MacKenzie...

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.388
I looked up your family history.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.845
Your seven-times great grandparents

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:56.018
were William and Sara MacKenzie.

01:09:56.401 --> 01:10:00.144
They couldn't have children, so they were
given one to raise as their own.

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:03.401
That child belonged to Dougal MacKenzie
and Geillis Duncan.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:09.203
So you're saying that my ancestors
are actually the war chief that you spoke of

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:10.870
and the witch?

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.532
Don't drag Roger into this.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:17.043
He has the same right as you
to know who he is.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.414
If all this is true,
then we have to stop her, don't we?

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:23.883
If she's going back to be burned alive.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.136
You're kidding me.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.553
But what if she never goes back,

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:30.424
never meets Dougal MacKenzie,

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.600
never has their child?

01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:34.890
What if you're never born?

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.930
How can I not be born? I'm here.

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:38.939
I can't just evaporate.

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:41.776
I don't know how this all works.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.573
Roger, you're not buying this, are you?

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:48.863
I don't know.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:51.115
Butjust to be on the safe side,

01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:53.913
I say we find her. Warn her, at least.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.909
Yes, I could warn her

01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:01.288
not to draw attention to herself in the past.

01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:03.168
Do you see what's happening here?

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.341
Roger, you are feeding her delusions.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.216
Bflanna.

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:11.673
Maybe I am.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.509
But this could be our chance
to make her actually face it.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:15.972
Face what?

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:17.350
Gillian.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:20.182
See what Gillian says about all this.

01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:23.193
And what if Gillian is as crazy as she is?

01:11:23.321 --> 01:11:26.689
What if she really thinks that you can travel
through solid stone to the past?

01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:30.651
Well, then maybe we all get to watch her slam
her head into a five-tonne block of granite.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:34.700
Either way, this gives us a chance
to put a stop to it all.

01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:39.459
- Okay.
- I'll get my KEYS-

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:16.200
Where are we going?

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.998
Red Jamie won't get far, but you...

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:21.247
I can save you, and I will.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.037
Well, we can leave together. Now.

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:25.587
We could sail somewhere, anywhere.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:28.292
The country is roused
and the ports are closed.

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:29.797
I'm not afraid to die, Sassenach.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:31.427
A musket ball, maybe a blade.

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:34.680
It's better than the hangman's noose
or the wrath of the MacKenzies.

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:38.100
I'm a dead man already,
so I choose the battlefield.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.555
- No. Then I will stay here with you.
- No, no, you won't.

01:12:43.234 --> 01:12:46.602
At the witch trial,
if I'd have gone to the stake with Geillis,

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:47.985
would you have left me?

01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:49.403
Left you?

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:51.235
I would have gone to the stake with you,

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:55.076
to hell and beyond, if it had gone to that,

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:57.658
but I wasn't carrying your child.

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.373
You can't know that.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:03.873
It's much too soon. It...

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:07.123
Sassenach, you have not been
a day late in your courses

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.503
in all the time since ye first took me
to yer bed,

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:11.460
but it's been two months now.

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:14.216
You kept track?

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:18.971
In the middle of this bloody war,
you kept track?

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.473
Aye. How long have you known?

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:25.769
Not long.

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:27.725
This child,

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.151
this one

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:32.822
is all that will be left of me,

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.491
<i>ever.</i>

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:41.202
But now we must go, so I beg you, Claire...

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.533
No, no, I can't leave you.

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:45.952
You heard me give my word to Rupert,

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:49.210
and you made me a promise
to spare Randall's life.

01:13:49.717 --> 01:13:53.551
You promised me that if it came to this,
ye would go back through the stones,

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:54.719
back home.

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:56.387
But you are my home.

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:58.131
And you are mine,

01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:00.883
but this home is lost.

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:06.606
And now you and the bairn,
you must go to a safe place.

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:09.976
Toa man...

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:12.820
A man that could care for you both.

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:14.192
No.

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:16.987
- No, I...
- Claire.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:18.660
Claire, there's no time.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.380
That's her husband's car.

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:41.341
It's this way. Come on.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:44.932
- What is that smell?
- It smells like a fuckin' barbecue.

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:00.739
Geillis, no!

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:09.793
Where did she go?

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.713
Oh, my God. She went through the stone.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:14.836
She went right through it.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:18.716
- Can you hear that? That buzzing?
- Aye.

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:20.513
It's getting louder.

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:25.055
Oh, my God.

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:29.223
Roger, go get help.

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:30.116
How will I explain all this?

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:34.875
How can I go back?

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:38.958
To Frank.

01:16:41.555 --> 01:16:43.512
All that I leave to you.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:47.008
Tell him what you will about me...

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:49.893
About us.

01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:53.432
It's likely he'll no want to hear,
but if he does...

01:16:58.197 --> 01:16:59.733
Tell him I'm grateful.

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.695
And tell him I trust him,

01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:07.950
and tell him I hate him
to the very marrow of his bones.

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:12.579
The buzzing.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.080
It's so loud.

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:19.791
I'm not ready, Jamie. I'm not ready.

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.502
Come with me.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:25.304
- Come with me through the stones.
- Na, I can't.

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:27.973
You could try.

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:30.510
You hear it, right? The buzzing?

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.939
I don't hear anything, Claire.

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:40.566
Even if I could...

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:43.272
Go back through the stones...

01:17:48.122 --> 01:17:49.578
It's not my place.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.042
My destiny lies on Culloden Moor.

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:58.875
But I'll find you.

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:02.090
I promise.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.553
If I have to endure 200 years of purgatory,

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.807
200 years without you,

01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:12.222
then that is my punishment

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:14.895
that I have earned for my crimes,

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.312
for I have lied, killed, stolen,

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:21.060
betrayed...

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:26.274
And broken trust.

01:18:30.748 --> 01:18:32.455
But when I stand before God,

01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:37.577
I'll have one thing to say
to weigh against all the rest.

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:43.382
Lord,

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.635
you gave me a rare woman.

01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:53.601
And God, I loved her well.

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:50.191
It has begun.

01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:58.999
Our wedding gift

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:01.410
from Hugh Munro.

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:03.580
You keep it with you.

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:09.924
Blood of my blood.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:13.673
And bone of my bone.

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:16.263
As long as we both shall live.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.318
Come on.

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:39.703
This

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:41.955
belonged to my father.

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:45.705
Give it to the bairn,

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.836
when he's old enough.

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:54.639
I will name him Brian,

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.846
after your father.

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:23.956
I love you.

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:36.638
I love you.

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:42.436
And I you.

01:22:06.713 --> 01:22:08.249
Good-bye, Claire.

01:22:17.099 --> 01:22:18.305
It's true, then.

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:21.516
- Everything you said is true.
- Yes.

01:22:23.313 --> 01:22:25.099
Was that her husband?

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:28.057
I think so.

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:30.769
And so someone has to die
to travel through the stones?

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:33.571
I mean, is that how it works?

01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:36.524
Geillis believed
that she needed a human sacrifice,

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.484
but no one died when I went through.

01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:43.664
Wait.

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.659
Is this the last place you saw my father?

01:22:51.675 --> 01:22:52.710
Yes.

01:22:59.016 --> 01:23:00.347
I believe you.

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:03.809
I don't understand it, but...

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:09.356
I believe you.

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:12.400
No more lies.

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:16.154
From now on, I only want the truth
between you and me.

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:17.739
All right?

01:23:21.705 --> 01:23:23.446
You're so like your father.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.368
Yes.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:29.289
Only the truth from now on.

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:00.907
I've called the police,

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:03.285
anonymously, of course,

01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:06.914
and God knows how long it'll be
before they get here.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:10.372
Roger.

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:12.249
Tell her what you found.

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:20.132
Some research the Reverend did
at the request of your husband.

01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:23.089
Your husband Frank.

01:24:25.477 --> 01:24:28.219
I'm not certain if he ever
sent it on to Boston.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.764
Well, what does it say?

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:35.313
After the battle at Culloden,

01:24:36.113 --> 01:24:38.354
a few Jacobite soldiers,
all seriously wounded,

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:42.032
took refuge in an old house for two days,

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:44.076
then they were all taken out to be shot,

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:45.452
but one of them,

01:24:45.622 --> 01:24:48.990
a Fraser of the Master of Lovat's regiment,
escaped execution.

01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:55.579
There were a lot of Frasers
on the field that day.

01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:59.466
But only five Fraser officers,

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:01.714
and four of them have
their names memorialised

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:03.796
on a plaque in the church in Beauly, so...

01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:06.466
We know for certain that they were killed.

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.562
Who was the fifth?

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:15.899
James Fraser.

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:21.029
My father.

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:30.035
Jamie.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.877
He didn't die at Culloden?

01:25:40.427 --> 01:25:42.338
Well, he meant to die, but...

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:44.886
He didn't.

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:49.846
He survived.

01:25:54.608 --> 01:25:55.814
He...

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:57.312
He survived.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:09.528
If that's true, then...

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:22.424
I have to go back.
