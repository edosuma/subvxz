I must have taken my eyes off the road
and then...

02:36.199 --> 02:37.784
And then I don't...

02:37.867 --> 02:38.867
You don't remember?

02:40.203 --> 02:43.081
I was driving and...

02:43.164 --> 02:45.124
Ma'am, have you had anything to drink?

02:45.208 --> 02:46.251
No, I haven't.

02:49.963 --> 02:53.591
I couldn't sleep last night,
so I took a pill at 2 a.m.

02:53.675 --> 02:55.969
- You don't remember getting in the car?
- No.

02:57.303 --> 02:58.721
But you passed the Breathalyzer?

03:00.557 --> 03:01.557
I did.

03:03.142 --> 03:05.353
Babe, you gotta be careful with Ambien.

03:07.522 --> 03:08.522
Hey.

03:11.484 --> 03:12.652
Hey, Bonnie.

03:12.735 --> 03:14.445
- What are you doing?
- Walking.

03:15.697 --> 03:17.448
In the middle of nowhere?

03:17.532 --> 03:18.992
This isn't the middle of nowhere.

03:19.075 --> 03:20.869
You're on the side of the highway.

03:20.952 --> 03:22.328
I was hiking.

03:22.412 --> 03:24.122
Okay...

03:24.205 --> 03:25.248
What are you doing?

03:27.542 --> 03:28.542
Do you need a ride?

03:29.586 --> 03:33.381
Why would I want a ride if I'm on a hike,
Madeline?

03:33.464 --> 03:35.717
- Are you on drugs?
- Am I on drugs? What are you...?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.844
- Are you on drugs?
- I'm sorry...

03:37.927 --> 03:41.180
- I'm just walking. Can I walk?
- That just came out... I'm sorry.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.641
My God.

03:43.725 --> 03:45.602
Do you see what I'm saying?

03:45.685 --> 03:47.854
I have to get Abigail out of her house.

03:47.937 --> 03:49.188
That woman's not well.

03:51.983 --> 03:54.485
- Thank you. Here.
- No, it was eight women.

03:56.321 --> 03:59.532
- Uh-oh. What?
- You are a fucking incredible publicist.

03:59.616 --> 04:01.784
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- What?

04:01.868 --> 04:05.246
Guess who's going to be on the cover
next month

04:05.330 --> 04:08.458
of the number one women's magazine
in the U.S. of fucking A?

04:08.541 --> 04:10.752
- I have no idea.
- Oh, I think you know.

04:10.835 --> 04:13.212
I think you know
because you're fucking married to her.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.714
Oh, baby.

04:14.797 --> 04:17.341
- My cover girl. I've always known
- Gordon Klein.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.345
- you were a cover girl.
- Special Agent Michael Nelson with the FBI.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.096
- Hands on the hood of the car.
- Sorry...

04:22.180 --> 04:24.265
- What's going on?
- Hands on the hood now, sir.

04:24.349 --> 04:25.975
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What the fuck?

04:26.059 --> 04:29.103
- Title 18 of U.S. Code, section 371.
- Hold on! There's confusion, sir.

04:29.187 --> 04:31.773
- That's security fraud...
- That's my husband, Gordon Klein.

04:31.856 --> 04:33.107
Ma'am, please.

04:33.191 --> 04:35.271
- Securities fraud, title 15 of U.S...
- Call Walker.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.612
What the fuck is going on here?
What are you doing?

04:37.695 --> 04:39.155
You can't just assault somebody.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.324
You have the right
to remain silent.

04:41.407 --> 04:44.327
You have the right to have an attorney
present during any questioning.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.204
Call Walker now!

04:46.287 --> 04:47.288
- Let's go.
- You can't...

04:47.372 --> 04:49.374
We need you to stop, ma'am.
You need to relax.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.167
You're taking my husband in handcuffs.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.586
We understand.
We will get you the information.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.885
You had me worried sick.

05:02.095 --> 05:04.973
You know, it's my fault.
I had a bit of an emergency this morning,

05:05.056 --> 05:06.474
and Celeste came to my rescue.

05:07.558 --> 05:08.558
Where's your car?

05:10.353 --> 05:12.021
It broke down.

05:12.105 --> 05:13.189
Are the boys okay?

05:13.815 --> 05:16.943
Uh, yes, they're getting ready for school.
You went out like that?

05:17.026 --> 05:19.737
- Well, I had to.
- It was an emergency.

05:19.821 --> 05:21.280
What kind of an emergency?

05:22.448 --> 05:23.825
The kind short people have?

05:26.869 --> 05:28.705
You don't like me, do you, Madeline?

05:30.498 --> 05:32.583
I'm sure you mean well.

05:32.667 --> 05:38.131
You know, when I was very young,
my family just moved, and we...

05:38.214 --> 05:41.092
I was going to a brand-new school,
so I was especially scared,

05:41.175 --> 05:43.177
and my father gave me the best advice.

05:43.261 --> 05:47.265
He said,
"Mary Louise, you just seek out the bully,

05:47.348 --> 05:48.641
make friends with her."

05:50.601 --> 05:53.438
Am I the bully in this scenario?

05:53.521 --> 05:58.067
On your awesome days,
I suspect you are a godsend.

05:58.151 --> 06:02.238
But on your bad days, decidedly less so.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.660
Fucking weirdo.

06:07.744 --> 06:08.744
What?

06:10.329 --> 06:12.040
What?

06:13.791 --> 06:16.294
So did you think about
our practice date?

06:16.377 --> 06:18.463
- Our practice date?
- It's like a trial run.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.341
We could shower, we'd put on clothes,
we go to a restaurant,

06:22.425 --> 06:26.054
we eat, talk, and if it's not a total disaster,
then we could do it for real.

06:28.806 --> 06:29.891
Yeah.

06:29.974 --> 06:31.142
Um...

06:31.225 --> 06:34.395
I don't want to offend you, but you are...

06:34.479 --> 06:38.524
I do think you're a very genuine person,
but you're a very...

06:38.608 --> 06:40.318
You're very strange.

06:43.112 --> 06:45.490
You know, one of the last
socially acceptable bigotries

06:45.573 --> 06:47.575
is the one against weirdos.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.911
For what it's worth,
I'm emotionally intuitive.

06:49.994 --> 06:52.038
I get a feeling about people sometimes.

06:52.121 --> 06:54.749
- Mm. You have one about me?
- To be honest, no.

06:54.832 --> 06:59.378
But you're really tolerant
and you're friendly,

06:59.462 --> 07:00.671
and you're really pretty.

07:00.755 --> 07:02.465
You look good in waders.

07:02.548 --> 07:05.593
How could I least not make room
for the possibility?

07:17.855 --> 07:20.817
Are you and Dad going to get divorced?

07:20.900 --> 07:24.320
What? Honey.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.614
No, of course not.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.783
What makes you say this?

07:28.866 --> 07:32.912
Dad never makes you laugh.
And you seem mad at him.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.540
Well, I am not mad at him. Okay?

07:39.252 --> 07:40.711
Who are you mad at?

07:42.255 --> 07:43.255
Nobody.

07:52.932 --> 07:53.932

I still miss him.
I don't think it's ever gonna stop.

08:34.557 --> 08:39.187
When you talked to me about dating again,
it felt like an affront.

08:39.270 --> 08:41.856
Like, preposterous, even.

08:44.567 --> 08:45.776
I only want him.

08:47.612 --> 08:49.572
I'd like to try something.

08:53.951 --> 08:57.121
Think back to one of the times
he was abusing you.

08:58.372 --> 09:02.084
The time in the closet
after his office Christmas party.

09:04.545 --> 09:08.674
I want you to close your eyes
to replay that incident.

09:10.051 --> 09:13.471
- Please, don't ask me...
- It's important. Can you try?

09:18.100 --> 09:20.019
I want you to close your eyes.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.898
To replay the incident.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.045
Mm.

09:55.763 --> 09:59.183
Now I want you to put a close friend
in your place.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.022
Let's make it Madeline.
Put Madeline there instead of you.

10:05.106 --> 10:07.984
- Excuse me, I can't...
- Let's make it Madeline.

10:24.709 --> 10:25.709
Stop it.

10:29.005 --> 10:30.005
No!

10:32.341 --> 10:33.467
No!

10:33.551 --> 10:34.885
No!

10:59.577 --> 11:01.162
Did Madeline deserve that?

11:03.998 --> 11:07.668
Should Madeline stay
in that relationship?

11:12.965 --> 11:14.091
Just...

11:19.138 --> 11:20.264
Jacket.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.099
Thank you.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.270
Not today.

11:26.354 --> 11:27.354
All right.

11:29.231 --> 11:31.817
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Step over here please, ma'am.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.155
Arms like an airplane.

11:39.492 --> 11:40.785
Oh, my God.

11:45.456 --> 11:48.042
Gordon. What the fuck?

11:49.335 --> 11:50.544
What the fuck?

11:55.132 --> 11:57.385
I'll be out on bond, so...

11:57.468 --> 11:58.803
Oh...

12:01.263 --> 12:02.640
- Talk to me.
- I, uh...

12:02.723 --> 12:09.146
I made a big bet to short some stock
with, um, Saul Hoffman's company.

12:09.230 --> 12:12.066
Phederol, I think I told you about them,
it's the anticoagulant.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.735
The anticoagulant.
I thought that was a bust.

12:14.819 --> 12:17.196
It was. Oh, my...

12:17.279 --> 12:19.156
Um, which I knew, but, uh...

12:20.699 --> 12:22.243
no one else did.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.411
- Uh...
- Oh.

12:23.494 --> 12:26.997
- Fuck.
- So then the test results completely tanked,

12:27.081 --> 12:28.666
so I started shorting bigtime.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.169
Do you have to do time for that?

12:34.255 --> 12:36.966
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Okay...

12:38.092 --> 12:39.427
Listen.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.262
That's not the worst of it.

12:42.388 --> 12:43.388
What?

12:44.765 --> 12:46.642
I kind of bet the ranch.

12:48.185 --> 12:51.313
Our ranch. There's gonna be civil lawsuits
to follow that.

12:51.397 --> 12:53.441
- No.
- Um...

12:53.524 --> 12:55.443
We stand to be broke
by the end of the year,

12:55.526 --> 12:58.446
- and it might even be sooner.
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I don't...

12:58.529 --> 12:59.905
Listen, listen, listen.

12:59.989 --> 13:03.033
Amabella's gonna be okay.
They can't touch her trust.

13:03.117 --> 13:05.411
- It's irrevocable.
- But I didn't sign anything.

13:05.494 --> 13:09.165
- No, no, I know. I know you didn't,
- I didn't do anything. So my money is safe.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.876
but it's community property.
Amabella's trust is...

13:13.335 --> 13:15.004
Fuck. Goddamn it.

13:16.255 --> 13:17.255
Gordon...

13:18.883 --> 13:20.718
I'm not gonna not be rich.

13:20.801 --> 13:24.388
- I'm not gonna have you...
- This could be like a positive thing.

13:24.472 --> 13:27.558
That... Like, there are chapters of life...

13:27.641 --> 13:32.104
I will not not be rich.

13:37.109 --> 13:42.239
<i>♪ Oh, I'm asking ♪</i>

13:44.617 --> 13:45.951
He's really smart.

13:47.161 --> 13:49.121
I don't think there's
much faking it to him.

13:49.205 --> 13:52.791
He's very...
Think "what you see is what you get."

13:52.875 --> 13:53.751
He's weird, though.

13:53.834 --> 13:57.004
He's like maybe "Aspergery" or something.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.881
Like, there's just something...

13:58.964 --> 14:02.259
I don't know.
I've never really met anyone like him.

14:02.343 --> 14:04.595
They fake that sometimes, you know.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.639
- What? Having Asperger's?
- Yeah.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.433
- Get away with saying dumb shit.
- Bonnie.

14:09.517 --> 14:11.268
- Mom.
- Hey, baby.

14:15.981 --> 14:19.902
- Hi. What are you doing here?
- Surprise.

14:24.406 --> 14:27.701
- Your husband called me.
- What?

14:28.744 --> 14:30.162
You had no right.

14:30.246 --> 14:32.498
It's not about being right.
It's about being scared.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.250
- Scared of what?
- Of losing you.

14:34.333 --> 14:37.711
Nathan, if you're scared of losing me,
why don't you try talking to me?

14:37.795 --> 14:41.423
I fucking tried, and you know it.
I've tried. You know that.

14:42.716 --> 14:46.136
You know what, it fucked me up some
when my marriage to Madeline ended.

14:47.179 --> 14:49.223
Divorce creates trauma.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.642
Think something is gonna go on forever
and it doesn't.

14:51.725 --> 14:56.021
Then you're on the other side of it...
You don't trust the ground underneath your feet.

14:56.105 --> 14:59.942
I've never lost sight of the fact
that marriage is fragile.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.443
That it can all go away.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.405
And you...

15:04.488 --> 15:06.907
I don't know where you've gone,
but you're not here.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.800
He's in prison,
and he might stay in fucking prison,

15:24.883 --> 15:27.219
and he's lost all our money.

15:27.303 --> 15:29.138
- Maybe he gets out, what, for days?
- What?

15:29.221 --> 15:30.639
- Until they fucking... Yes.
- What?

15:30.723 --> 15:33.142
He's lost fucking everything.
My money too. His money.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.394
- Okay. Here, here. Come here, come here.
- What?

15:35.477 --> 15:37.688
No, we can't go in there.
We're not going in there.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.274
Babe, this is a disaster.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.067
Oh, my God.

15:42.151 --> 15:45.070
Oh, my God.
This fucker put me back in the hole.

15:45.154 --> 15:47.364
This fucker put me back in the hole.

15:47.448 --> 15:50.743
This is my fucking childhood.

15:50.826 --> 15:53.912
This is everything I've worked
to get out of.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.956
- Quinlan was there. I am telling you,
- What?

15:56.040 --> 15:58.626
I think she's been watching,
and she tipped somebody off.

15:58.709 --> 16:03.339
- What? I thought it was the FBI.
- But then who the fuck is tipping them off?

16:03.422 --> 16:06.592
And why is the FBI
taking my fucking computer?

16:06.675 --> 16:08.761
They went to my office.
They took my iPad.

16:08.844 --> 16:10.929
- What?
- I just... Okay.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.640
I need to call an estate lawyer.

16:12.723 --> 16:15.351
Okay, and I need to do a list of assets.

16:15.434 --> 16:17.728
- You're right.
- Do you need a Xanax or...?

16:19.647 --> 16:22.733
When we swallow our feelings,
especially the bad ones,

16:22.816 --> 16:25.444
sometimes they can turn
into really ugly monsters,

16:25.527 --> 16:27.154
which is not a good thing.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.991
I want you to know that it's perfectly okay
to come and talk to me, okay?

16:31.075 --> 16:34.161
You can talk to me about anything,
whether it was over a put-down,

16:34.244 --> 16:37.122
something that happened here,
something that happened on the news,

16:37.206 --> 16:39.875
anything you need to talk about,
I'm here.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.006
Anyone?

16:51.345 --> 16:53.305
What about a dead father?

16:56.475 --> 17:01.313
He said it quite simply,
without any sense of trauma, so...

17:01.397 --> 17:03.440
Whether that's better or worse...

17:06.318 --> 17:10.571
- Are they still getting counseling?
- Um, yeah.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.657
I'm really sorry about this.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.829
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

17:16.912 --> 17:19.707
It's good to talk about what we feel.

17:19.790 --> 17:20.790
I just...

17:23.377 --> 17:27.339
I just think it's best if you talk to me,
you know, rather than at school.

17:27.423 --> 17:31.135
- But you don't like to talk about it.
- That's not true.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.554
You like to pretend everything's okay.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.893
Well, I shouldn't do that.

17:39.977 --> 17:41.562
I...

17:41.645 --> 17:43.856
We're a family, and...

17:45.274 --> 17:49.820
And a family is meant to be open
and honest with each other, so...

17:50.863 --> 17:53.323
I don't think we're that kind of family.

17:53.407 --> 17:56.785
What? Yeah, we are.
Of course we are, Max.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.538
Of course we are.

18:08.547 --> 18:11.341
- Grandma.
- Put it on the counter, please.

18:14.636 --> 18:15.763
Hi.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.389
What happen...?

18:17.473 --> 18:19.975
Something came up at school.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.352
It's like you said the other night...

18:24.313 --> 18:25.731
They're still grieving.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.610
It's all just so hard, you know?

18:29.693 --> 18:30.944
Hmm...

18:34.239 --> 18:35.949
I do. I do know.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.952
Right after the accident,
after we lost Raymond,

18:39.036 --> 18:42.539
I was sure I would not be able to go on.

18:43.791 --> 18:46.877
I was never sure
about anything in my whole life,

18:46.960 --> 18:49.880
that I wouldn't go on, but I did.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.173
Because of Perry.

18:52.633 --> 18:55.052
And so will you, because of the boys.

18:58.806 --> 19:00.766
What happened this morning?

19:04.645 --> 19:06.355
I don't know. I just...

19:08.690 --> 19:13.695
I took an Ambien when I couldn't sleep,
and before I knew it, I was driving a car.

19:13.779 --> 19:16.448
- Has that ever happened before?
- No.

19:21.203 --> 19:25.916
I've decided to rent an apartment locally,

19:25.999 --> 19:31.713
so that I can, um, be nearby,
but not, you know...

19:31.797 --> 19:36.176
I wanna be here when you need me, Celeste,
and not when you don't.

19:37.511 --> 19:39.847
I'm so grateful to you
for everything you've done,

19:39.930 --> 19:41.974
but a little space might be good.

19:47.771 --> 19:51.233
Madeline told me
that you and she had words.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.401
I don't like her.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.987
Well, you have to try.

19:55.070 --> 19:58.866
Well, I have tried,
but she's not a likable person.

20:01.326 --> 20:04.329
She's been a lifeline to me.
She really has.

20:04.413 --> 20:05.998
- She's a wonderful person.
- Mm.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.333
Well, you're mistaken.

20:08.417 --> 20:11.753
Did I ever tell you
that she once saved Max from drowning?

20:11.837 --> 20:13.130
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

20:14.631 --> 20:15.674
Huh.

20:15.757 --> 20:16.757
Where were you?

20:19.386 --> 20:21.179
- What?
- I feel like you always look at me

20:21.263 --> 20:24.266
with such... suspicion.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.685
No, I don't mean to.

20:27.728 --> 20:31.523
I do look at you as, uh... an enigma.

20:31.607 --> 20:34.192
That's how Perry first described you
to me.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.903
Did you know that?

20:35.986 --> 20:37.279
Stop it! Hey!

20:37.362 --> 20:39.281
- Stop, you idiot!
- Hey!

20:39.364 --> 20:40.490
Stop!

20:41.533 --> 20:43.035
- Hey!
- Stop!

20:43.118 --> 20:44.786
- That's enough.
- Stop it.

20:44.870 --> 20:47.039
- Stop it. I said stop it.
- Stop it! Stop!

20:47.122 --> 20:48.665
That is enough! Stop it!

20:48.749 --> 20:51.001
That is enough.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.836
- Fuck off!
- What did you say?

20:53.879 --> 20:54.963
No!

20:55.047 --> 20:57.090
You will not be like him!

20:57.174 --> 20:58.174
You...

21:00.010 --> 21:01.511
Max, I'm sorry.

21:01.595 --> 21:04.097
Maxie? Maxie, I'm sorry.

21:05.891 --> 21:06.891
I'm sorry.

21:06.934 --> 21:08.852
Mom.

21:08.936 --> 21:10.854
Oh, my God.

21:10.938 --> 21:12.189
Josh, come here.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.943
Are you all right? Huh?

21:16.777 --> 21:17.777
Are you okay?

21:27.412 --> 21:28.538
You smell that?

21:29.581 --> 21:31.458
Clears your sinuses right out.

21:32.834 --> 21:36.213
We have all this newfangled stuff
to improve ourselves.

21:37.631 --> 21:40.300
Self-help apps all over our phones.

21:41.343 --> 21:47.516
Sometimes all we need to do
is just stand still and breathe.

21:47.599 --> 21:51.520
To just breathe in the air
that's all around us.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.230
Is that for me, Mama?

21:54.773 --> 21:56.817
You want me to breathe better?

22:02.155 --> 22:06.243
- Tell me what's going on, Bonnie.
- Nothing, Nathan's just tripping.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.121
Nathan is a complete dolt.

22:09.204 --> 22:12.082
When it comes to emotional,
social intelligence,

22:12.165 --> 22:15.127
oh, Bonnie, he's as dumb as a rock.

22:16.420 --> 22:20.590
But I often wonder
if that's why you married him.

22:20.674 --> 22:24.136
You are out here surrounded by people
who don't even get you.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.138
They don't look like you.

22:26.221 --> 22:29.725
I haven't seen one other black person
since I've been out here.

22:29.808 --> 22:31.935
Is that why you're here?

22:32.019 --> 22:36.940
I mean, because we all know
how fond you are of your walls.

22:37.024 --> 22:38.483
You are out of control.

22:40.527 --> 22:44.114
Something's in the air, Bonnie.
And I don't like it.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.706
You know, I decided to run.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.500
For office?

22:56.835 --> 22:59.504
I swear to fucking God, man.
No, I decided to take up running

22:59.588 --> 23:02.340
because Bonnie likes running.
She's obsessed with it.

23:02.424 --> 23:05.677
- I'm trying to embrace her interests.
- So I'm off the hook for lunch, then?

23:05.761 --> 23:09.347
You remember what you said to me
last year about "give me a reason"?

23:09.431 --> 23:11.850
Should we just get this
out of our system, man?

23:13.268 --> 23:15.979
Okay, so you've asked me
to have lunch with your wife,

23:16.063 --> 23:19.775
and now you challenge me to a fistfight.

23:19.858 --> 23:23.612
I mean, do you have a preference
if I can't squeeze in both?

23:25.614 --> 23:26.615
Really?

23:27.657 --> 23:30.160
- So that's a no, huh?
- Okay.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.370
- Don't, buddy. Don't.
- Okay.

23:32.454 --> 23:33.454
Warning.

23:37.167 --> 23:42.255
Case 6273.
<i>United States v. Gordon Klein.</i>

23:42.339 --> 23:45.467
James Taylor on behalf of the
United States, Your Honor.

23:48.804 --> 23:52.891
Steve Gardner on behalf of Mr. Klein,
Your Honor. Plead not guilty.

23:56.937 --> 23:58.980
Mr. Klein.

23:59.064 --> 24:02.734
You're being charged with security fraud,
mail fraud and wire fraud,

24:02.818 --> 24:07.572
violating Section 17A
of the Securities Act of 1933

24:07.656 --> 24:11.618
and Rule 105
of Regulation M of the Exchange Act.

24:12.994 --> 24:14.454
Question of bail?

24:14.538 --> 24:15.831
No priors, judge.

24:15.914 --> 24:20.919
I ask that the defendant post bail
in excess of $1 million

24:21.002 --> 24:23.421
in light of the severity of the charge.

24:23.505 --> 24:25.757
One million sounds excessive.

24:25.841 --> 24:27.634
One million bond.

24:27.717 --> 24:30.011
Five hundred thousand dollars cash...

24:30.095 --> 24:31.346
Stop!

24:32.764 --> 24:35.851
We'll conference on Tuesday
to set a schedule.

24:35.934 --> 24:38.478
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.447
I swear someone's gonna do a start-up,

24:49.531 --> 24:52.159
and they're gonna make,
like, the perfect French fry.

24:52.242 --> 24:56.121
It's gonna be, like, nutritional
and healthy and no cal.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.372
It's gonna be a gold mine.

24:57.455 --> 25:00.375
Remember when you used to call them
pomp freaks?

25:00.458 --> 25:01.543
Mm-hm.

25:02.252 --> 25:03.128
French fries.

25:03.211 --> 25:06.131
When she was little,
I told her they were called <i>pommes frites,</i>

25:06.214 --> 25:09.551
and then she started calling them
pomp freaks.

25:09.634 --> 25:12.429
I never even noticed
you eating a French fry.

25:12.512 --> 25:13.680
I eat French fries.

25:13.763 --> 25:15.974
Yeah, you're right.
You just didn't notice, did you?

25:16.057 --> 25:17.601
That's your thing, isn't it?

25:18.643 --> 25:20.896
- Wait, what?
- Don't get all sensitive with yourself.

25:20.979 --> 25:22.814
I'm not. I'm not being sensitive.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.482
- I'm just... What do you mean?
- Honey?

25:27.068 --> 25:28.653
No, I notice things.

25:29.613 --> 25:30.739
I mean...

25:30.822 --> 25:34.451
Like, I noticed shit,
and then I asked you to come.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.036
- So...
- Well, I'm here...

25:37.370 --> 25:39.915
because you're ill-equipped
to connect with your wife.

25:44.336 --> 25:46.504
- Mom, you're drinking again.
- No.

25:47.589 --> 25:50.926
I mean, it's just one glass. Occasionally.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.510
One glass is fine.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.055
One hundred, not so much.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.389
Those days are over.

25:57.474 --> 26:00.185
- Your problem is you're oblivious.
- Will you stop?

26:00.268 --> 26:03.396
You call me and you say
that something's wrong with Bonnie.

26:04.522 --> 26:05.941
"Bonnie's not herself."

26:07.025 --> 26:10.695
"Been going on six months
to a year or so."

26:13.073 --> 26:15.742
Can you narrow that down
a little bit further for me, Nathan?

26:15.825 --> 26:18.912
I mean, can you pinpoint a specific date?

26:18.995 --> 26:20.830
Instance. Anything?

26:21.873 --> 26:23.166
Because I can.

26:25.502 --> 26:26.836
It was after that event.

26:27.921 --> 26:30.715
You all went to that student gala.

26:30.799 --> 26:31.967
Where the man died.

26:33.343 --> 26:34.678
And Bonnie was there.

26:36.805 --> 26:38.807
Your wife watched a man
fall down the steps

26:38.890 --> 26:42.227
and bust his goddamn head open
and splatter all over the place and die.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.896
I don't know, from then to now,

26:44.980 --> 26:47.482
she's probably been dealing
with post-traumatic stress.

26:47.565 --> 26:49.150
I'm fine.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.486
- We're in a restaurant, honey.
- What does that mean?

26:51.569 --> 26:54.364
What, we should just glaze over it?
Act like everything is okay?

26:54.447 --> 26:57.075
Things are not okay.
Your daughter is not okay.

26:58.243 --> 27:01.913
And this mope-a-dope shit,
it clearly is not working for your husband.

27:01.997 --> 27:04.416
And I doubt very much
that it's working for your child.

27:04.499 --> 27:07.210
And from what I see,
it is not working for you.

27:07.294 --> 27:08.294
Mom.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.592
I'm really happy you're here.

27:18.430 --> 27:21.349
Can we just have a dinner
like a normal family?

27:21.433 --> 27:24.436
We are having dinner
like a normal family.

27:24.519 --> 27:27.981
Getting in each other's business, that's
what families do. That's why he called.

27:42.329 --> 27:44.497
<i>So you don't have any siblings?</i>

27:44.581 --> 27:45.749
<i>I had a brother.</i>

27:45.832 --> 27:47.208
Oh.

27:47.292 --> 27:49.669
He passed away when I was 5.

27:49.753 --> 27:51.171
Oh...

27:51.254 --> 27:52.547
Sorry about that.

27:52.630 --> 27:55.592
What about you?

27:58.303 --> 27:59.721
I'm an only child.

28:02.182 --> 28:04.517
- I mean, as far as I know.
- Oh, yeah?

28:04.601 --> 28:08.104
Yeah, I'm not very close to my dad, so...
Right?

28:09.439 --> 28:10.565
You never know.

28:12.442 --> 28:16.488
So your mom passed away,

28:16.571 --> 28:19.991
and you don't have any siblings,
as far as you know,

28:20.075 --> 28:22.619
and you don't talk much to your dad.

28:22.702 --> 28:23.703
Mm.

28:27.457 --> 28:30.126
Now, I don't mean to be presumptuous,
but...

28:31.836 --> 28:33.797
if this works out...

28:35.799 --> 28:37.759
I would have you all to myself.

28:49.229 --> 28:52.023
- Boys are tucked in.
- Thank you, Mary Louise.

28:52.107 --> 28:54.818
They must have been exhausted.
Max is asleep already.

28:56.236 --> 28:58.279
They tell me they have a brother.

28:59.614 --> 29:01.866
Evidently, Perry had a son.

29:01.950 --> 29:04.244
- What?
- With another woman.

29:04.327 --> 29:06.121
And the boy's in their class.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.916
Seems I have another grandchild.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.504
Might you have the decency to tell me...

29:15.630 --> 29:16.630
his name?

29:19.008 --> 29:21.136
- No.
<i>- Then how could they know?</i>

29:21.219 --> 29:23.638
I don't know.
You know what, we did tell that detective.

29:23.721 --> 29:25.682
- That bitch. She probably let it slip...
- Mom.

29:25.765 --> 29:29.894
I'm sorry. You know what, Celeste,
just find out what the boys know exactly

29:29.978 --> 29:32.063
<i>and then call me right back, okay? Bye.</i>

29:33.148 --> 29:34.858
What now?

29:34.941 --> 29:37.068
Celeste, just stuff with the twins, and...

29:37.152 --> 29:39.446
Did they find out Ziggy's their brother?

29:39.529 --> 29:40.655
Who told you that?

29:41.823 --> 29:43.616
I heard you talking on the phone once.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.951
Did you tell Max and Josh?

29:45.034 --> 29:48.496
Only that they have a brother
in the second grade.

29:48.580 --> 29:50.874
- Chloe, good God.
- I didn't say who.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.750
- Did you tell Ziggy this?
- Mm-hm.

29:52.834 --> 29:56.337
Wait, Perry Wright is Ziggy's father?

29:57.672 --> 29:59.757
- You know what, go to your room.
- I'm sorry.

29:59.841 --> 30:02.886
Give me your phone.
I'll deal with you later.

30:04.387 --> 30:06.473
<i>I'm so sorry. She's grounded.</i>

30:10.143 --> 30:12.061
- I gotta go.
<i>- Okay, I...</i>

30:13.396 --> 30:14.689
Oh, fuck.

30:14.772 --> 30:18.193
Hey. Talk for a sec?

30:18.276 --> 30:21.821
- What did I do?
- You didn't do anything. Um...

30:22.864 --> 30:25.783
Did Chloe Mackenzie say anything
to you about...

30:26.826 --> 30:28.495
About who your father is?

30:30.580 --> 30:32.999
She said it was Max and Josh's dad.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.334
Is it?

30:44.010 --> 30:45.261
Mm-hm.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.891
How long have you known for?

30:49.974 --> 30:51.518
Since August.

30:51.601 --> 30:55.146
Ziggy, you've known since August
and you haven't said anything to me?

30:56.397 --> 30:58.149
Figured you'd just lie.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.654
I didn't know.

31:02.737 --> 31:04.864
All of those years
of you asking me where he was

31:04.948 --> 31:06.449
or who he was, I...

31:07.700 --> 31:09.536
I didn't know who he was.

31:13.540 --> 31:16.668
I didn't know until Trivia Night.

31:16.751 --> 31:18.294
- And...
- But why didn't you tell me?

31:18.378 --> 31:20.338
Because I didn't know how.

31:21.464 --> 31:22.924
I just thought that I would wait.

31:24.384 --> 31:27.929
- Till when?
- Till you got older, I guess.

31:31.641 --> 31:33.685
Did Chloe tell you anything else?

31:35.895 --> 31:39.274
She said something about Mr. Wright
giving you salt.

31:39.357 --> 31:41.526
That's how I happened.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.027
He salted you.

31:54.205 --> 31:55.205
No.

32:04.924 --> 32:05.967
Then what did she mean?

32:07.260 --> 32:08.970
Can I sit down next to you?

32:18.313 --> 32:23.151
I think what Chloe overheard
was the word "assault."

32:27.780 --> 32:29.032
What does that mean?

32:43.546 --> 32:46.966
- Look, I wanted to tell you.
- Yeah, but you didn't.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.719
Well, I was trying to protect
Jane and Celeste's privacy.

32:49.802 --> 32:52.555
- But I'm your husband. Okay?
- Okay, but can you understand

32:52.639 --> 32:56.392
and maybe contemplate for a minute
the fundamental violation

32:56.476 --> 32:58.728
of a woman's privacy
when you're talking about rape?

32:58.811 --> 33:02.273
How about the fundamental violation
of our family, of our marriage.

33:02.357 --> 33:06.152
I mean, I'm your husband.
I am supposed to help you with this stuff.

33:06.235 --> 33:11.407
I mean, of course she's gonna hear you
whispering on the fucking phone, Madeline.

33:11.491 --> 33:14.118
I mean, look what our daughter did.

33:14.202 --> 33:17.997
What are we, people who keep secrets
from each other? Is that our thing now?

33:18.081 --> 33:19.123
Come on.

33:20.416 --> 33:21.626
Jesus.

33:26.756 --> 33:27.756
Mom?

33:29.258 --> 33:31.010
I'm really sorry again.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.057
I know you are, honey. I know.

33:37.100 --> 33:41.020
You can't tell your friends private things
that you've overheard us say on the phone.

33:42.105 --> 33:45.775
Okay?
No more eavesdropping, young lady.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.735
Is Daddy mad at me?

33:50.071 --> 33:51.447
Daddy's mad.

33:51.531 --> 33:53.741
But that's the thing about families,

33:53.825 --> 33:56.619
is that you can be mad and you can fight,

33:56.703 --> 33:59.539
but you get over it,
and you always come back together.

33:59.622 --> 34:01.708
That's what families do.

34:01.791 --> 34:03.835
- So we're gonna be okay.
- Okay.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.755
Can I have my phone back?

34:11.467 --> 34:14.594
So this thing
was supposed to have happened when?

34:14.679 --> 34:17.431
Like nine years ago?

34:17.514 --> 34:21.893
When you two were trying so hard
to have a baby? Please.

34:24.021 --> 34:26.940
When did you find out
about this alleged affair?

34:27.024 --> 34:30.485
It wasn't an affair. It was a rape. Rape.

34:30.570 --> 34:34.657
- When did you find out?
- The night he died.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.413
Then how can you...?

34:40.496 --> 34:44.292
This woman, she could have had
multiple partners, you know.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.754
She could have been drugged.
She... You don't know her.

34:47.837 --> 34:49.464
She could have been...

34:49.547 --> 34:51.591
What if she got it wrong?

34:51.674 --> 34:52.925
Aren't you desperate

34:53.009 --> 34:55.678
- She didn't.
- for her to be wrong?

34:55.762 --> 34:59.724
Aren't you desperate to know
that he wasn't unfaithful?

34:59.807 --> 35:04.312
To believe that he... He wasn't capable
of doing the things that she said.

35:05.605 --> 35:07.356
He wasn't.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.567
I'll never believe that.

35:09.650 --> 35:12.487
Your son wasn't an innocent man.
He beat me up.

35:12.570 --> 35:14.906
- I don't believe you.
- Many times. He...

35:14.989 --> 35:17.200
Why wouldn't you go to the police?

35:17.283 --> 35:20.912
- I probably should have.
- But you didn't.

35:20.995 --> 35:24.165
- No, because it wasn't simple.
- I don't believe you.

35:24.248 --> 35:26.751
I don't understand why you're so willing
to believe her.

35:26.834 --> 35:32.882
I don't know why you are willing
to assassinate his character, his memory,

35:32.965 --> 35:34.550
who he was.

35:34.634 --> 35:37.512
- What...? I...
- It's so hard.

35:37.595 --> 35:39.972
I'm telling you what it was.

35:40.056 --> 35:43.267
I'm not saying I was blameless.

35:43.351 --> 35:47.480
I'm just telling you
we were violent with each other,

35:47.563 --> 35:49.232
and sometimes...

35:52.276 --> 35:54.403
Sometimes it would lead to sex.

35:56.155 --> 35:58.032
I don't... I...

35:58.115 --> 35:59.700
We loved each other.

35:59.784 --> 36:02.036
- We were...
- But he beat you up.

36:04.163 --> 36:06.374
We had a sickness.

36:06.457 --> 36:08.459
And you didn't go to the police?

36:10.044 --> 36:11.044
I just...

36:12.380 --> 36:13.965
I'll go to the police.

36:15.424 --> 36:16.551
What?

36:16.634 --> 36:18.469
To get some answers.

36:18.553 --> 36:20.596
You left some things out, didn't you?

36:20.680 --> 36:24.267
The fact that he fathered another child.
You left that out.

36:24.350 --> 36:27.270
That you planned to move,
that you rented an apartment.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.563
You left that out.

36:30.565 --> 36:34.527
That you were planning to leave him
the very night he died.

36:34.610 --> 36:36.028
You left that out.

36:38.656 --> 36:40.408
And that you...

36:40.491 --> 36:45.872
You learned of his infidelity
just 10 seconds before he...

36:49.041 --> 36:52.336
went falling down a flight of stairs
to his death.

36:53.713 --> 36:56.340
Oh, you left that out too.

38:17.296 --> 38:18.422
How's Ziggy?

38:20.007 --> 38:21.007
He's, uh...

38:22.802 --> 38:23.802
I don't know.

38:24.845 --> 38:25.845
And you?

38:26.681 --> 38:29.308
Um, I gotta tell you something. I...

38:32.019 --> 38:33.980
I told Ziggy about the circumstances.

38:35.064 --> 38:36.691
The violence of it?

38:36.774 --> 38:38.150
Mm-hm.

38:38.234 --> 38:39.902
- What?
- Just a little bit, but he knows

38:39.986 --> 38:43.823
that he cannot share it with Max and Josh.
That it's just for him.

38:43.906 --> 38:46.242
- But we had an agreement.
- I know. I know.

38:46.325 --> 38:49.161
- We were gonna wait.
- I know, but I can't lie to him anymore.

38:49.245 --> 38:50.246
- I can't...
- No, I...

38:50.329 --> 38:52.206
- His entire life has just been built
- Jane.

38:52.289 --> 38:55.668
on a foundation of lies.
I can't just... I can't continue.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.795
And I know
that you have to protect your boys,

38:57.878 --> 39:00.297
but I have to protect mine.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.425
I have to be honest with him.

39:05.678 --> 39:08.514
Ugh. God, this is so fucked up.

39:11.809 --> 39:13.894
Have you told your boys about Ziggy?

39:14.937 --> 39:17.314
Not yet, no. I just...

39:19.859 --> 39:21.485
I will. I mean...

39:28.200 --> 39:29.493
Bonnie.

39:29.577 --> 39:30.995
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:31.078 --> 39:33.372
- Could you talk for a second?
- Sure.

39:33.456 --> 39:34.915
Um...

39:34.999 --> 39:40.254
This is in no way meant to blame you
or Nathan at all, for that matter,

39:40.337 --> 39:44.050
but that said, I just feel strongly
that Abigail come stay with me.

39:44.133 --> 39:46.594
Yeah,
she needs more than I can give her.

39:50.264 --> 39:52.475
What's going on?

39:52.558 --> 39:53.558
Are you okay?

39:54.727 --> 39:59.106
No, I'm not okay. I told you I wasn't okay.
I'm having a hard time with the whole thing.

40:01.192 --> 40:05.905
Sometimes I wake up at night in a sweat
with this feeling.

40:07.865 --> 40:10.409
It's gonna get us. It's gonna get us all.

40:11.744 --> 40:13.370
Who are you talking about?

40:15.122 --> 40:16.123
The lie.

40:18.793 --> 40:19.793
I gotta go.

40:38.354 --> 40:41.440

You think that'll happen again?

40:44.276 --> 40:46.570
I mean, give me one fucking reason.

40:48.405 --> 40:49.448

Are you fucking kidding me?

41:10.928 --> 41:13.639

41:13.722 --> 41:16.058
- Is that what I said to you?
- Maybe I wanted more!

41:16.142 --> 41:18.269
- Just get the fuck out. Please.
- Oh, please.

41:18.352 --> 41:21.147
- Just stop being dramatic and drive.
- You're gonna blame me?

41:21.230 --> 41:24.650
- Did I say I was blaming you?
- Blame me while you lost my money?

41:24.733 --> 41:26.527
- I didn't say...
- Get out of my car!

41:26.610 --> 41:28.490

41:43.502 --> 41:45.171

42:12.907 --> 42:15.326
I'm not resisting the idea
of coming back here.

42:15.409 --> 42:17.953
Well, that's a relief.

42:18.037 --> 42:22.291
As long as the main goal isn't trying
to convince me to go to college.

42:22.374 --> 42:26.086
The endgame is to move you
into a stable environment

42:26.170 --> 42:29.215
where your executive
decision-making skills are nurtured.

42:29.298 --> 42:30.424
That's a good one.

42:30.507 --> 42:32.718
Can I just say one thing, though?

42:32.801 --> 42:34.511
I think you're being rash, honey.

42:34.595 --> 42:38.515
Life is a series of building blocks
that you stand on and you grow on,

42:38.599 --> 42:41.810
and I feel like you are kicking
the most fundamental building block,

42:41.894 --> 42:44.146
which is education,
right out from under you.

42:44.230 --> 42:47.900
You used to claim that family
was your most fundamental building block.

42:47.983 --> 42:49.985
Well, of course. It's very important.

42:50.069 --> 42:52.655
What, you just, like, kicked that one
to the side?

42:52.738 --> 42:54.615
What do you mean?

42:54.698 --> 42:57.368
You were fucking the theater director
last year, so...

42:57.451 --> 43:00.913
- That's inappropriate. This is not about me.
- You're being really hypocritical.

43:00.996 --> 43:03.624
- This is about you and your future.

I don't know.

44:05.769 --> 44:09.398
This is what I do know.
He's part of your family now.

44:12.151 --> 44:15.070
And, I mean,
family isn't always everything, but...

44:16.322 --> 44:17.323
sometimes it is.

44:19.116 --> 44:22.661
- Was Daddy a bad person?
- No.

44:22.745 --> 44:23.745
No, no, no.

44:24.997 --> 44:28.751
Your daddy was a wonderful person.
A beautiful person.

44:30.002 --> 44:31.587
He could be weak...

44:35.716 --> 44:36.800
like we all can.

44:36.884 --> 44:38.927
And he could make mistakes, but your...

44:41.930 --> 44:47.186
Your daddy was a beautiful,
wonderful man.

45:04.161 --> 45:05.161
Okay. Uh...

45:07.539 --> 45:09.792
Thank you for coming back.

45:09.875 --> 45:11.460
I, um...

45:13.337 --> 45:18.133
At best as I fathom,
and I cannot fathom what I've done, I...

45:19.676 --> 45:22.596
This was about me, and I...

45:22.679 --> 45:26.058
I'm so sorry. I... This was not about you.

45:26.141 --> 45:28.185
- Maybe about us as a couple.
- Mm-hm.

45:28.268 --> 45:30.479
And I think we should get therapy.

45:30.562 --> 45:31.688
Okay.

45:31.772 --> 45:34.483
But I need you to know
that this has nothing to do with you.

45:34.566 --> 45:37.069
This happened so long ago.

45:37.152 --> 45:39.279
And it has nothing to do
with how much I love you

45:39.363 --> 45:41.365
because I love you so much, and...

45:43.325 --> 45:46.120
And I just need to know
what you're thinking.

45:46.203 --> 45:53.001
That you would keep the secret
that you kept about Perry and Ziggy.

45:54.920 --> 45:58.340
That you would be unfaithful.

45:58.424 --> 45:59.466
Um...

46:01.885 --> 46:04.179
That you would tell Abigail about it.

46:05.639 --> 46:08.809
I know. That is...
That happened in a moment of weakness.

46:08.892 --> 46:09.892
When?

46:11.228 --> 46:12.396
Last year.

46:13.772 --> 46:15.149
So she's known a year?

46:16.191 --> 46:19.695
My daughter,
and yes, I do think of her as a daughter,

46:19.778 --> 46:22.197
has known this for a year?

46:22.281 --> 46:25.325
Yes, I'm sorry, I fucked up. I, um...

46:26.869 --> 46:28.745
But I'm gonna do anything I can to fix it.

46:28.829 --> 46:31.665
- Does Chloe know?
- No.

46:31.748 --> 46:33.625
No, of course not.

46:33.709 --> 46:37.379
- How can you be so sure?
- No, Ed, I promise you, she doesn't know.

46:37.463 --> 46:39.339
I'm so sorry, she...

46:40.799 --> 46:45.846
Look, this just isn't about you.
It's about me. This is about us.

46:45.929 --> 46:48.307
When you say "us," what...

46:48.390 --> 46:50.809
I mean, what does that even mean?

46:52.352 --> 46:55.355
Because it can't mean honesty.

46:56.648 --> 46:59.902
Right? It can't mean truth or trust.

47:00.944 --> 47:03.447
I mean, it can't mean you and me
confiding in each other,

47:03.530 --> 47:06.533
so what's "us"?

47:09.995 --> 47:13.040
You asked me what I'm thinking.
I'll tell you.

47:13.123 --> 47:15.792
I think we're done.

47:40.734 --> 47:42.861
I do appreciate you coming, Mama.

47:43.904 --> 47:44.904
I do.

47:46.406 --> 47:47.406
Meaning...

47:48.617 --> 47:49.617
"Enough."

47:56.708 --> 48:00.254
I do not want any of that
in my family's life.

48:02.339 --> 48:04.258
We're not having that conversation again.

48:09.471 --> 48:12.015
I have been having visions lately, Bonnie.

48:13.392 --> 48:15.686
- And I know you've had some too.
- Mom.

48:18.021 --> 48:21.191
- They are strong, baby.
- Don't. Don't.

48:23.652 --> 48:25.654
- Somebody's drowning.
- Stop.

48:27.072 --> 48:30.742
I see lots of water,
and somebody's drowning.

48:34.121 --> 48:36.498
I see you drowning right now in a way.

48:40.460 --> 48:42.337
Who's gonna protect you, baby?

48:44.506 --> 48:46.800
I do not need you to protect me.

48:48.635 --> 48:51.305
Not from evil spirits, or your visions...

48:51.388 --> 48:52.431
From what, then?

48:55.559 --> 48:56.559
Tell me.

49:01.231 --> 49:03.525
What have you done this time?

49:04.276 --> 49:05.277
Hmm?

49:12.034 --> 49:13.327
I do want you to go.

49:17.956 --> 49:19.583
I love you too, honey.

49:23.629 --> 49:26.006
Okay, you invited her, you get rid of her.

49:26.089 --> 49:27.341
Get rid of her?

49:28.133 --> 49:29.885
Like, maybe with rat poison?

49:30.927 --> 49:32.471
Or a weekend with Maddie?

49:37.351 --> 49:39.519
Seriously, though,
can you tell her to go?

49:44.650 --> 49:46.652
Can you tell me what's going on?

49:49.863 --> 49:51.365
Be patient, baby.

49:55.035 --> 49:56.035
Patient.
