03:18.710 --> 03:20.678
If I leave now, I'll beat the traffic.

03:20.778 --> 03:22.781
There's nobody up there.

03:22.881 --> 03:26.551
I called yesterday and told Ed
to get the boat out. Stop worrying.

03:26.651 --> 03:28.715
What about your patients?

03:30.155 --> 03:33.202
- Robert is covering them.
- For how long?

03:36.647 --> 03:37.660
I don't know.

03:38.997 --> 03:41.731
You've never opened
the cottage before. Let me come.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.336
Let me help you.

03:44.436 --> 03:48.204
I don't want your help.
I wouldn't mind the challenge.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.325
I'm worried about you.

03:51.609 --> 03:56.178
You bulldozed Dad's garden.
I would've taken care of it.

03:56.581 --> 03:59.892
The garden was young when I was young
and old when I was old

03:59.992 --> 04:02.518
and will die when I die.

04:03.321 --> 04:04.687
His words.

04:05.256 --> 04:07.790
You know I hate long goodbyes.

04:09.127 --> 04:11.162
I'll be fine.

04:11.262 --> 04:13.263
I have to do this alone.

04:14.791 --> 04:17.235
Oh, Henry.

04:18.670 --> 04:21.241
Don't forget to feed his fish.

05:34.746 --> 05:39.781
Hey, Henry.
No, it's okay. I told you I'd call.

05:41.285 --> 05:43.427
Well, everything's fine.

05:44.122 --> 05:45.891
Yeah.

05:45.991 --> 05:48.557
Well, blown fuse.

05:48.927 --> 05:51.026
No, flood lights.

05:51.462 --> 05:55.631
Hey, didn't your father have someone
clean out the chimney last year?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.436
Yeah, that's what I thought.
No, calm down. I'm not on the roof.

06:01.673 --> 06:03.360
No.

06:14.552 --> 06:17.098
I've got to get the fire started.

06:18.923 --> 06:20.990
I'll call you later.

06:21.592 --> 06:23.526
I'm alright.

08:06.797 --> 08:09.334
- <i>Want me to read aloud to you?</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

08:09.434 --> 08:13.738
<i>When he awoke at daylight again,
there'd be no storm.</i>

08:13.838 --> 08:16.007
<i>Morning was bright,</i>

08:16.107 --> 08:18.100
and clean-smelling...

08:18.200 --> 08:20.075
and cool.

08:20.178 --> 08:23.045
There was no sign of Wirt Sewell.

08:23.214 --> 08:27.550
Sorry, I'm going to have to put that gum in
your belly-button for a second, thank you.

08:27.919 --> 08:30.477
Nor could Gault discover
any evidence to suggest

08:30.577 --> 08:34.623
that the lanky express agent
had been there at all.

08:35.058 --> 08:36.227
You're not even into this.

08:36.327 --> 08:38.462
Yeah, I am, I'm listening,
I'm listening, I love this.

08:38.563 --> 08:40.837
What's the name of the book?

08:42.500 --> 08:46.036
- What's the name of the book?
- The Son of... it's The Son of...

08:47.772 --> 08:49.772
It's Clifton Adams.

08:49.872 --> 08:53.811
- <i>It's Clifton James...</i>
- <i>No. You got one thing right.</i>

09:08.125 --> 09:10.962
<i>Do you want to be healed
or be a big sissy about it?</i>

09:11.062 --> 09:13.932
- Like I'm not the sissy.
- I'll still be gentle.

09:14.032 --> 09:15.934
Look, that's good, right?

09:16.034 --> 09:18.267
That's nice. Oh, that's...

10:03.347 --> 10:05.728
What do you want to play?

10:07.085 --> 10:10.019
I've got... Oh, I dislike you.

10:12.390 --> 10:16.158
- Give me that.
- You want to take a drag?

11:07.979 --> 11:12.250
<i>Never win and never lose</i>

11:12.850 --> 11:16.051
<i>There's nothing much to choose</i>

11:16.988 --> 11:21.123
<i>Between right and wrong</i>

11:24.562 --> 11:29.367
<i>Nothing lost and nothing gained</i>

11:29.467 --> 11:33.604
<i>Still things aren't quite the same</i>

11:33.704 --> 11:37.808
<i>Between you and me</i>

11:40.778 --> 11:47.315
<i>I keep a close watch
on this heart of mine</i>

11:49.220 --> 11:55.757
<i>I keep a close watch
on this heart of mine</i>

12:06.403 --> 12:11.276
<i>I still hear your voice at night</i>

12:11.376 --> 12:15.513
<i>When I turn out the light</i>

12:15.613 --> 12:19.648
<i>And try to settle down</i>

12:22.720 --> 12:27.713
<i>But there is nothing I can do</i>

12:28.059 --> 12:32.230
<i>'Cause I can't live without you</i>

12:32.330 --> 12:36.365
<i>Any way at all</i>

12:39.303 --> 12:45.866
<i>I keep a close watch
on this heart of mine</i>

12:47.578 --> 12:54.170
<i>I keep a close watch
on this heart of mine</i>

12:55.953 --> 13:02.539
<i>I keep a close watch
on this heart of mine</i>

13:51.742 --> 13:53.500
Shit.

14:16.801 --> 14:19.868
It's Helen. Helen Matthews. Over.

14:22.807 --> 14:26.290
<i>Hey, Helen, what are you
doing up so early? Over.</i>

14:27.178 --> 14:32.416
Ed, I'm having engine trouble.
I'm two clicks away from the marina.

14:32.516 --> 14:35.617
Just off Guthrie Point. Over.

14:37.354 --> 14:41.157
- <i>I'll be right out, Helen. Over.</i>
- Okay.

14:56.307 --> 14:58.175
Henry's not up yet?

14:58.275 --> 15:03.047
No. He's back in Toronto.
He'll probably be up in a month or so.

15:03.147 --> 15:05.683
How long are you planning to stay?

15:05.983 --> 15:07.985
Not sure.

15:08.085 --> 15:11.155
This was always James's
favorite time of the year.

15:11.455 --> 15:13.990
When the tourists aren't up yet.

15:16.260 --> 15:20.064
Well, I'll give you a call
when your boat's ready.

15:20.164 --> 15:22.066
Probably in a day or two.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.569
The little one will have to do.

15:25.536 --> 15:27.408
I got it.

17:44.909 --> 17:47.704
<i>Hi, you've reached James Matthews.
I can't take...</i>

20:44.789 --> 20:46.944
Oh, my God.

20:58.469 --> 21:01.572
Just calm down. Calm down.

21:01.672 --> 21:05.273
You found me. I can help you.

21:08.312 --> 21:09.981
Okay.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.683
No, please, please.
Please don't leave. Please don't leave.

21:12.983 --> 21:16.620
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

21:26.463 --> 21:27.865
Okay.

21:40.477 --> 21:42.546
Okay, alright.

21:42.646 --> 21:45.843
Calm down. Okay.

23:13.003 --> 23:14.844
Let go.

23:16.206 --> 23:18.075
Let go.

23:18.575 --> 23:20.754
Let go. It's okay.

23:32.005 --> 23:33.973
Fuck!

24:40.824 --> 24:44.718
I need you to open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

24:47.564 --> 24:50.467
Swallow. Swallow.

24:50.567 --> 24:52.301
Drink.

27:03.833 --> 27:05.602
Shit.

29:41.191 --> 29:43.354
Hello?

30:58.935 --> 31:00.893
Hello?

32:57.353 --> 32:59.038
I was looking for an Aspirin.

33:05.527 --> 33:08.580
Did I tell you to take an Aspirin?

33:23.045 --> 33:24.918
Take those.

33:32.121 --> 33:34.024
Red sky in the morning,
sailor's warning?

33:34.474 --> 33:35.540
What?

33:36.792 --> 33:41.862
- No, it's just an old saying.
- No, I know the saying.

33:43.032 --> 33:46.266
My husband says it all the time.

33:46.469 --> 33:48.502
Where's he at?

33:49.105 --> 33:53.586
In the city.
He's coming back later today.

33:59.282 --> 34:01.752
I'm William.

34:01.918 --> 34:03.626
Will.

34:04.988 --> 34:07.923
Helen. You're bleeding again.

34:15.097 --> 34:17.266
- Put it back down. Put it down.
- Okay.

34:17.367 --> 34:19.485
Just relax.

34:19.585 --> 34:21.565
Relax it.

34:32.649 --> 34:36.120
- Stay very still.
- Okay.

34:43.192 --> 34:45.520
How'd you find me?

34:48.630 --> 34:51.137
You were the only light.

34:53.101 --> 34:56.306
- You up for Easter then?
- No.

34:56.406 --> 34:58.417
What happened?

34:59.075 --> 35:01.177
Don't worry about it.

35:01.277 --> 35:03.280
What happened?

35:03.580 --> 35:06.282
Some men attacked me,
but don't worry about it.

35:06.382 --> 35:08.915
Why didn't you go to the police?

35:12.055 --> 35:14.425
Do you own that boat?

35:14.525 --> 35:16.308
Do you own that boat?

35:16.408 --> 35:19.021
I borrowed the boat, I'll get it back.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.082
Do you live around here?

35:24.467 --> 35:26.642
Sort of, yeah.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.988
- Stay very still.
- Okay.

35:43.139 --> 35:47.283
- Who shot you?
- I told you who shot me. Please...

35:47.383 --> 35:49.405
Just leave it.

35:56.966 --> 35:58.669
Look...

35:59.369 --> 36:01.704
I fixed you up, you're not going to die.

36:01.804 --> 36:05.374
You need to leave as soon
as the weather permits, okay?

36:05.474 --> 36:07.107
Just...

36:07.777 --> 36:10.109
It's fine. I'll leave right now.

36:12.682 --> 36:15.915
Can you just give me
a ride to the highway?

36:17.987 --> 36:20.537
No, I can't do that.

36:24.093 --> 36:27.289
That's fine. Just point me in the direction
of the road. I'll get out of your hair.

36:27.389 --> 36:30.817
No, no, no, no. You don't understand.

36:31.667 --> 36:37.273
There's no road. We're on an island.
The marina is far. I was just out in this.

36:37.373 --> 36:40.476
A storm's coming
and the water is dangerous.

36:40.576 --> 36:43.012
You fall in that water,
you freeze to death.

36:43.112 --> 36:45.882
Alright, fuck it. I'll take my boat.

36:45.982 --> 36:47.967
You'll die in five minutes
in that little boat.

36:48.067 --> 36:49.957
I'll be fine.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.819
Take it, it's worth something.

36:52.955 --> 36:57.193
- I don't want your watch.
- Take it. I don't like favors.

36:57.293 --> 36:59.392
It wasn't a favor.

37:00.562 --> 37:02.698
You saved my life,
you didn't have to do that. Take it.

37:02.798 --> 37:06.533
Yes, I did. You wouldn't have
lasted the night. I...

37:10.673 --> 37:12.534
Thank you.

37:22.385 --> 37:24.002
Shit.

38:07.296 --> 38:09.564
I'm fine, go away.

38:40.415 --> 38:43.447
You're not from around here,
I know that.

38:46.602 --> 38:48.922
I'm from Calgary.

39:00.983 --> 39:02.750
I really like your place.

39:03.886 --> 39:05.758
It's nice.

39:08.458 --> 39:10.527
It's been in...

39:11.227 --> 39:15.064
It's been in my husband's family
for, I don't know...

39:15.164 --> 39:17.630
a hundred years.

39:20.703 --> 39:23.182
What did you do out west?

39:24.974 --> 39:27.218
Nothing special.

39:27.977 --> 39:29.871
I mean, it's Calgary.

39:31.380 --> 39:32.627
But...

39:34.483 --> 39:37.820
No, I did a bunch of things.
I did everything.

39:37.920 --> 39:41.857
The last thing I did, I worked
in the oil sands for a while.

39:41.957 --> 39:45.435
But I didn't like that too much.
Needed to get out.

39:45.927 --> 39:48.644
But how did you end up here?

39:50.199 --> 39:53.833
My mom, she grew up outside
of Collingwood, so...

39:54.503 --> 39:57.300
She used to take me here
when I was a kid.

40:03.479 --> 40:05.245
William...

40:11.653 --> 40:13.644
Who shot you?

40:20.963 --> 40:24.744
As soon as it calms down outside
I'll be on my way, I promise.

40:28.337 --> 40:30.039
Fine.

40:30.239 --> 40:32.018
Good.

40:33.392 --> 40:35.142
Good.

40:36.245 --> 40:38.617
Oh, good.

40:39.515 --> 40:41.893
Good, good, good.

40:44.453 --> 40:46.686
<i>Do you want me to cook, John?</i>

40:46.856 --> 40:50.239
We could make some fried pickles.

40:51.627 --> 40:52.728
Yes.

40:52.828 --> 40:55.119
- You're up for fried pickles?
- I don't know.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.636
- I'm delirious.
- A little bit.

41:00.736 --> 41:05.196
I worked this...
I worked this 16-hour day yesterday.

41:06.041 --> 41:08.363
16 hours.

41:09.412 --> 41:11.714
You need a foot massage.

41:41.377 --> 41:44.171
I saw your boat.
I didn't know you were up.

41:44.714 --> 41:47.708
I had to open the cottage
sooner or later.

41:48.317 --> 41:50.920
I just wanted to make sure
you're alright, you know.

41:51.020 --> 41:54.990
A big storm's coming in, there's thousands
already out of power...

41:57.627 --> 41:59.056
Fuck!

42:02.464 --> 42:06.301
- Hey, do you know that guy?
- Yeah, sure. He can give us a ride.

42:06.401 --> 42:09.337
- Listen to me, you cannot let him in.
- What, why?

42:09.437 --> 42:12.445
Helen, if you let him in,
we are both dead.

42:14.410 --> 42:17.694
- What?
- Get rid of him.

42:30.526 --> 42:33.763
- Sorry, it's not fresh.
- Oh, that's alright.

42:33.863 --> 42:37.768
- So, how have you been?
- Oh, fine.

42:38.333 --> 42:40.102
Better.

42:42.705 --> 42:46.108
- Hey, how's the roof holding up?
- No leaks.

42:46.208 --> 42:48.625
Didn't take long, few days.

42:48.725 --> 42:51.652
We got a big snowfall this winter
so I'm happy I insisted

42:51.752 --> 42:54.516
otherwise the whole roof
could've caved right in, right?

42:54.616 --> 42:57.219
I appreciate it, Al. Thank you.

42:57.319 --> 43:00.387
- Do you want sugar?
- No.

43:05.675 --> 43:07.570
Thank you.

43:08.597 --> 43:10.866
I didn't know you had...

43:11.199 --> 43:13.855
I didn't know you had any visitors.

43:15.565 --> 43:19.374
A man. His boat washed up
on my shore so...

43:19.474 --> 43:21.808
Did you call the cops?

43:24.347 --> 43:27.249
Well, I can't get a signal
on my cell phone

43:27.349 --> 43:30.887
and the Pro-Line's in the shop, so...

43:31.587 --> 43:35.319
But I do need to get him into town.

43:37.860 --> 43:41.197
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sure, of course. Of course, yeah.

43:41.297 --> 43:42.732
Great.

43:42.832 --> 43:45.701
I'm going to grab a few things and...

43:45.801 --> 43:47.681
I'll get him and...

43:47.781 --> 43:51.755
Okay, but I mean, you know
that storm's coming fast, right, so...

43:51.855 --> 43:55.542
I mean, they're saying it's going to be
bigger than last October's.

44:01.218 --> 44:02.870
Help.

44:13.862 --> 44:16.135
What the hell?

44:31.313 --> 44:33.452
Oh, my God.

44:35.918 --> 44:39.248
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

46:12.525 --> 46:14.148
Okay.

47:29.091 --> 47:31.382
Oh, fuck.

47:32.160 --> 47:33.095
Did you hurt yourself?

47:33.195 --> 47:36.153
- No, it's fine. It's nothing.
- Let me see.

47:37.166 --> 47:39.109
It's nothing.

47:45.874 --> 47:48.389
It's okay, doc. I promise.

48:14.736 --> 48:16.926
What are you doing?

48:18.340 --> 48:20.207
What do you mean? What are you doing?

48:23.812 --> 48:25.804
What's the matter?

48:30.152 --> 48:32.010
What?

48:33.222 --> 48:36.156
What's going on? I mean who's after you?

48:38.893 --> 48:42.064
I've known Al for years,
I've treated his family.

48:42.164 --> 48:44.730
Why would he strand me here?

48:45.500 --> 48:49.067
What have you done to make people
come after you to the middle of nowhere?

48:50.305 --> 48:52.338
What happened?

48:55.344 --> 48:57.589
It was an accident.

48:58.580 --> 49:00.013
What?

49:00.849 --> 49:02.885
An accident.

49:02.985 --> 49:08.488
A bar fight got out of hand and...

49:11.827 --> 49:14.149
It was my fault.

49:18.333 --> 49:20.070
And...

49:20.570 --> 49:25.314
I did all of the time.
All of the fucking time.

49:28.176 --> 49:31.800
But the guy's father he's not going
to stop until he's killed me.

49:40.422 --> 49:44.126
I mean, you... He's dead.

49:44.226 --> 49:45.992
Right?

49:48.864 --> 49:50.887
You killed him.

49:54.937 --> 49:58.704
I'm sorry I put you in danger.
I'm sorry.

50:00.843 --> 50:02.678
This...

50:02.778 --> 50:06.348
This isn't my problem.
It's not my business.

50:06.448 --> 50:10.703
- I... get out of my house.
- Helen, I'm not leaving you.

50:10.803 --> 50:12.888
I've had enough of this shit!
Get out of my house.

50:12.988 --> 50:14.657
I'm not leaving you by yourself
knowing what's coming.

50:14.757 --> 50:18.059
- I'm not by myself.
- You're not? Where's your husband.

50:18.159 --> 50:20.593
- He's gone.
- Gone? You mean dead?

50:23.365 --> 50:25.134
- Get out of my house.
- I'm not leaving.

50:25.234 --> 50:27.636
Get out of my... Get out of my house.

50:27.736 --> 50:30.305
- God damn you!
- Fuck me!

50:30.805 --> 50:32.594
Fuck!

50:35.611 --> 50:37.600
Oh, God.

51:18.620 --> 51:21.080
You regret that one?

51:21.990 --> 51:25.457
I regret most of them, not that one.

51:30.699 --> 51:32.457
Emily's my mum's name.

51:37.072 --> 51:40.539
That tattoo is not for your mother.

51:49.718 --> 51:52.184
I'm sorry about your husband.

51:59.194 --> 52:00.474
It's okay.

52:02.097 --> 52:07.667
He got caught in a storm
last October on the lake.

52:10.605 --> 52:14.441
Went out first thing in the morning
to buy groceries. Never came back.

52:16.511 --> 52:21.883
He asked me to go with him but I was
talking to a friend on the phone.

52:23.585 --> 52:25.851
Barely looked up.

52:27.622 --> 52:29.718
I just said...

52:30.926 --> 52:33.065
'Don't forget your list'.

52:37.199 --> 52:39.432
Phone rang.

52:43.739 --> 52:46.877
'Your husband was in an accident.

52:47.709 --> 52:50.130
Sorry, Mrs. Matthews.'

52:52.514 --> 52:54.911
I stood there holding the phone...

52:58.086 --> 52:59.812
gone.

53:04.025 --> 53:07.560
He left me a message
asking me to call him.

53:08.396 --> 53:10.732
I keep wondering...

53:10.832 --> 53:12.619
what...

53:13.802 --> 53:16.261
What did he want?

53:18.873 --> 53:21.169
I mean it's no one's fault but his.

53:22.144 --> 53:26.501
He shouldn't have tried to go through
the storm. He should have waited it out.

53:28.883 --> 53:31.525
He never would have tried...

53:32.287 --> 53:34.791
if I'd been there with him.

53:39.794 --> 53:41.441
I could have saved him.

53:42.164 --> 53:44.784
He would've turned back.

53:55.710 --> 53:57.312
Hey.

53:57.612 --> 53:59.654
Give me your hand.

54:12.995 --> 54:16.857
We spent our entire lives together.

54:19.401 --> 54:21.439
And he died alone.

54:36.518 --> 54:41.053
I'm really... I'm really sorry
I hurt you like that.

54:43.158 --> 54:44.757
It's fine.

55:32.874 --> 55:35.069
How far is the marina?

55:35.677 --> 55:37.736
45 minutes.

55:40.281 --> 55:42.835
Well, how far is it in a storm?

55:43.418 --> 55:49.121
Well, it's open water so storms out here
are like storms on the ocean.

55:50.358 --> 55:54.062
Alright. So about an hour,
hour and a half then.

55:54.162 --> 55:55.864
Yeah.

55:55.964 --> 55:57.833
About that.

55:59.651 --> 56:00.976
Or never.

56:04.706 --> 56:06.410
Alright.

56:08.343 --> 56:10.429
Alright what?

56:11.046 --> 56:13.369
That guy that was here is going to take
about an hour back to the marina,

56:13.469 --> 56:17.460
some more time to find his boss,
then another hour back here so we got...

56:18.219 --> 56:21.553
three hours, maybe less,
before they're back for me.

56:23.592 --> 56:25.668
How many bullets you got?

58:04.692 --> 58:08.230
What are the woods like back there?
Can they attack us from behind?

58:08.330 --> 58:09.864
Impossible.

58:09.964 --> 58:13.068
Sheer rock, 30 feet. It's not going
to happen from the back.

58:13.168 --> 58:15.387
We need to make it difficult
from the front

58:15.487 --> 58:19.554
because once they come ashore
we're in trouble.

58:19.941 --> 58:21.376
Yeah, I've seen that guy before.

58:21.476 --> 58:25.347
Well, he's a local. He's done
odd jobs for us over the years.

58:25.447 --> 58:28.173
Always in and out of jail.

58:29.017 --> 58:32.311
- For what?
- Just gambling debts.

58:33.788 --> 58:34.992
So he knows the area.

58:35.092 --> 58:38.751
He knows it well. We come up just for the
weekends he's spent his whole life here.

58:44.833 --> 58:47.297
How good are you with that thing?

58:47.936 --> 58:49.004
Very good.

58:50.505 --> 58:52.163
Good.

58:55.209 --> 58:57.843
Do you want to make us some coffee?

59:00.615 --> 59:02.450
Sure.

59:02.550 --> 59:04.383
Black.

59:05.153 --> 59:07.038
One sugar.

01:00:26.234 --> 01:00:29.071
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?
We could use those!

01:00:29.171 --> 01:00:31.006
I don't want a goddamn crowbar
used against me.

01:00:31.106 --> 01:00:32.808
They've got guns, what are they
going to want with an axe?

01:00:32.908 --> 01:00:37.409
- I don't want to find out.
- Okay, well, I'm keeping the crowbar.

01:00:38.646 --> 01:00:40.579
We've got to do something
about the dock.

01:00:42.016 --> 01:00:43.762
Come on.

01:00:50.892 --> 01:00:53.278
Nope. Lights are out.

01:00:53.694 --> 01:00:56.083
It's a blown fuse.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:10.778
Got it.

01:01:10.878 --> 01:01:12.868
That's good.

01:01:48.116 --> 01:01:50.051
Maybe they won't make it.

01:01:50.151 --> 01:01:52.503
Yeah, the weather's pretty bad.

01:01:52.754 --> 01:01:55.164
They might not make it.

01:01:59.961 --> 01:02:01.886
You alright?

01:02:13.741 --> 01:02:16.048
You want to play some cribbage?

01:02:28.523 --> 01:02:30.291
Good.

01:02:30.994 --> 01:02:35.597
Not great. Fifteen two, fifteen four,
fifteen six, fifteen eight.

01:02:35.697 --> 01:02:37.199
And a pair for the win.

01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:45.774
Who taught you to play anyway?

01:02:49.676 --> 01:02:51.410
My brother.

01:02:53.114 --> 01:02:55.312
Yeah, we used to play a lot.

01:02:58.619 --> 01:03:00.906
Are you close?

01:03:06.927 --> 01:03:09.093
Yeah, we were.

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:14.176
You know, it's funny. You think
you can always just turn it around.

01:03:17.438 --> 01:03:20.787
Like no matter what,
you can just walk it back.

01:03:23.678 --> 01:03:25.187
But you can't.

01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:36.539
I know you know that.

01:03:44.298 --> 01:03:48.800
But there's this other part of you
that knows you've got to get on with it.

01:03:49.771 --> 01:03:52.206
Like you never forget about it,
you never forget.

01:03:52.306 --> 01:03:53.952
But you've got to get on with it.

01:03:57.078 --> 01:04:00.615
You just decide that this awful thing...

01:04:00.715 --> 01:04:02.063
you make it count.

01:04:03.851 --> 01:04:07.318
From here on out, you make it count.

01:04:16.664 --> 01:04:18.697
Another round?

01:04:29.977 --> 01:04:32.845
- <i>Can I get you a beer?</i>
- <i>No thanks, love.</i>

01:04:39.887 --> 01:04:41.953
Hey, Will.

01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:44.756
Hey.

01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:51.499
Any good?

01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:54.132
Yeah, it's good.

01:04:55.236 --> 01:04:59.071
- 622 affairs?
- Yeah, I'm not there yet.

01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:04.742
The girl I was seeing gave it to me.

01:05:06.414 --> 01:05:08.649
Did it work out?

01:05:08.749 --> 01:05:12.350
- Oh, no.
- Was it worth it?

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.686
Yeah.

01:05:19.193 --> 01:05:21.631
I bought a Thunderbird.

01:05:23.564 --> 01:05:27.366
- She need a lot of work?
- Nothing that can't be fixed.

01:05:30.354 --> 01:05:32.587
How'd you find me, Tom?

01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:38.713
You always think there's going to be
a little bit more time, you know.

01:05:38.813 --> 01:05:41.162
And it just runs out.

01:05:42.917 --> 01:05:45.238
Sorry about this, Will.

01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:12.727
There. That one, right there.

01:07:21.415 --> 01:07:23.384
I'm scared.

01:07:23.684 --> 01:07:25.447
I'm scared too.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:36.316
- Shit, but they found us.
- Okay.

01:07:37.265 --> 01:07:39.098
There we are.

01:07:44.171 --> 01:07:48.302
- Where's the dock?
- Oh. Looks like she let her go.

01:07:48.402 --> 01:07:50.311
Well, do you think someone
could have found him?

01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:53.347
Nah, no. No, the power's out
in the whole region.

01:07:53.447 --> 01:07:55.911
I mean they're there, right?

01:08:14.402 --> 01:08:18.729
- We're going to have to wade in?
- No way, the water's freezing.

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:20.703
We could...

01:08:25.312 --> 01:08:28.086
Well, right there. How about that.

01:09:01.081 --> 01:09:03.340
Oh, God.

01:09:33.013 --> 01:09:34.746
Fuck.

01:09:54.435 --> 01:09:56.144
Oh, shit!

01:10:00.207 --> 01:10:03.490
- Come on, come on.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

01:10:37.611 --> 01:10:39.547
We need to separate.
Use the rifle, don't hesitate.

01:10:39.647 --> 01:10:42.717
- No. If we separate, I can't protect you.
- He's not after you.

01:10:42.817 --> 01:10:44.826
Get the fuck out of here. Go! Go!

01:10:46.153 --> 01:10:47.952
Will!

01:10:51.025 --> 01:10:52.991
Shit!

01:11:08.175 --> 01:11:09.967
No one there.

01:11:10.244 --> 01:11:12.660
Must have gone in the woods.

01:11:12.913 --> 01:11:14.748
So, if you want...

01:11:14.848 --> 01:11:17.351
I'll go around the outside
and you can shoot right in there.

01:11:17.451 --> 01:11:20.318
- Okay.
- Yeah? Alright.

01:12:04.831 --> 01:12:06.583
Shit.

01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:45.578
Oh, God.

01:13:07.027 --> 01:13:09.029
Oh, God.

01:13:09.129 --> 01:13:10.360
Really?

01:13:22.743 --> 01:13:26.598
This is nice. I like this.

01:13:27.248 --> 01:13:29.594
I could get used to this.

01:13:44.498 --> 01:13:46.397
I'm Tom.

01:13:53.573 --> 01:13:54.704
Helen.

01:13:55.959 --> 01:13:58.516
Sorry you got caught up in all this.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.858
Well, this one's fun.

01:14:22.353 --> 01:14:24.574
Is that your husband?

01:14:27.724 --> 01:14:31.042
- Yeah.
- He a good guy?

01:14:32.513 --> 01:14:34.575
I think so.

01:14:37.851 --> 01:14:39.984
Got any coffee?

01:14:50.531 --> 01:14:53.453
So what are you doing
out here all alone, then?

01:14:55.402 --> 01:14:59.072
- Peace and quiet.
- I can understand that.

01:14:59.172 --> 01:15:01.241
I'm a city boy myself.

01:15:01.341 --> 01:15:05.146
30 fucking years,
it wears you down, I'm telling you.

01:15:05.246 --> 01:15:08.649
It's become so uncivilized.
Do you know what I mean?

01:15:08.749 --> 01:15:10.614
Thank you.

01:15:19.726 --> 01:15:21.360
Did you love him?

01:15:26.233 --> 01:15:28.754
How long were you together for?

01:15:35.876 --> 01:15:37.612
32 years.

01:15:39.413 --> 01:15:41.466
A lifetime.

01:15:43.133 --> 01:15:45.168
Not quite.

01:15:51.941 --> 01:15:56.027
He's going to die tonight.
Will, he's going to die tonight.

01:15:57.331 --> 01:16:00.197
I mean we're all going to die,
but he's going to die tonight.

01:16:00.297 --> 01:16:02.233
Which is funny.

01:16:02.333 --> 01:16:04.585
Don't you think?

01:16:04.938 --> 01:16:06.673
I mean to know...

01:16:06.773 --> 01:16:10.690
and then you get up in the morning
you go about your day and then...

01:16:10.978 --> 01:16:12.880
it's all over.

01:16:14.348 --> 01:16:16.316
You die.

01:16:32.499 --> 01:16:34.568
He's nothing like me, you know that.

01:16:35.068 --> 01:16:37.334
I was proud of that.

01:16:39.373 --> 01:16:42.482
And he was always a little bit timid.

01:16:42.582 --> 01:16:44.178
You know?

01:16:44.278 --> 01:16:46.313
A little bit fearful.

01:16:46.413 --> 01:16:51.585
He was sweet, really. He always took people
at their word, you know. He was a...

01:16:51.685 --> 01:16:54.021
He was a literal boy.

01:16:54.121 --> 01:16:56.620
He was a simple boy.

01:16:57.257 --> 01:16:59.626
Done work all over Calgary.

01:16:59.726 --> 01:17:01.822
A bit of roofing.

01:17:02.462 --> 01:17:04.657
A bit of brick-laying.

01:17:08.235 --> 01:17:11.662
Hey, miss. Hey, I'm not going
to find him by myself, right?

01:17:12.172 --> 01:17:14.724
I need help out there, right?
I mean, it's pretty...

01:17:18.245 --> 01:17:21.068
Yeah, he's probably
on his way to me anyway.

01:17:22.115 --> 01:17:24.201
People go through their lives

01:17:24.301 --> 01:17:26.553
they take them for granted,
don't you think?

01:17:26.653 --> 01:17:28.902
I mean that...

01:17:29.856 --> 01:17:34.561
everything's going to be fine
and you can only fall so far

01:17:34.661 --> 01:17:37.497
and someone will be there to catch you.

01:17:37.597 --> 01:17:39.266
I never had that luxury.

01:17:39.366 --> 01:17:44.335
I always knew it was possible
to fall and to keep falling.

01:17:47.274 --> 01:17:50.210
People like you and me,
we can't afford to make a single mistake.

01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:52.079
No.

01:17:52.679 --> 01:17:54.748
- It's true, that.
- Yeah.

01:17:54.848 --> 01:17:57.881
- Right?
- Oh, my God.

01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:02.956
You know, I always wanted to be a dad...

01:18:03.056 --> 01:18:06.893
which is fucking... ridiculous

01:18:06.993 --> 01:18:08.629
when I think about it.

01:18:08.729 --> 01:18:11.272
Now, I looked forward to it.

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:16.136
And I fucking loved Will.

01:18:16.436 --> 01:18:20.473
I fucking loved him like he was
one of my own, you know?

01:18:20.573 --> 01:18:22.809
I took him in when he was what?

01:18:22.909 --> 01:18:25.412
10 years old? 10 years old.

01:18:25.512 --> 01:18:27.114
And I raised him up.

01:18:27.214 --> 01:18:31.051
I thought it'd be good for Chris,
you know to have an older brother.

01:18:31.151 --> 01:18:34.454
Like, someone to look up to.

01:18:34.554 --> 01:18:36.791
A good influence.

01:18:37.491 --> 01:18:40.627
You know, I mean,
he was an angry little fucker...

01:18:40.727 --> 01:18:41.742
you know.

01:18:42.729 --> 01:18:44.965
But I loved him.

01:18:45.065 --> 01:18:46.933
And...

01:18:47.033 --> 01:18:49.002
I loved his mom.

01:18:49.102 --> 01:18:51.105
And then when she died
he didn't have anyone else

01:18:51.205 --> 01:18:53.838
so I just took him in
and I raised him up.

01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:58.215
He's a lot like me, really.

01:18:59.546 --> 01:19:02.344
Hard as fucking nails.

01:19:04.885 --> 01:19:09.451
But... he was supposed
to look after my Chris.

01:19:10.774 --> 01:19:12.076
And do you know what he done?

01:19:12.176 --> 01:19:15.546
Do you know what he fucking done instead?
He fucking killed him.

01:19:15.646 --> 01:19:18.766
And I don't care what story Will told you
it's all a load of fucking bullshit

01:19:18.866 --> 01:19:21.435
because my Chris...

01:19:21.535 --> 01:19:24.605
would never, ever...

01:19:24.705 --> 01:19:26.820
put his hands on a fucking woman.

01:19:35.615 --> 01:19:37.723
I've had enough of this.

01:19:44.457 --> 01:19:46.424
Oh, my...

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.993
Oh, my God.

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:09.279
How you doing, Will?

01:20:09.683 --> 01:20:10.986
I've been better.

01:20:38.278 --> 01:20:40.216
Come here.

01:20:42.249 --> 01:20:44.405
Give me a hug.

01:20:55.862 --> 01:20:57.431
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:20:58.031 --> 01:21:00.163
I'm sorry.

01:21:12.246 --> 01:21:14.309
Sorry about this.

01:21:52.352 --> 01:21:54.087
<i>Hey, my love.</i>

01:21:54.187 --> 01:21:57.005
<i>You're not going to believe
what just happened.</i>

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.725
<i>Anyway... I love you. Call me back.</i>

01:22:02.562 --> 01:22:04.081
<i>The sky is beautiful.</i>

01:22:04.181 --> 01:22:07.682
<i>It looks like it's going to rain.
You should have come with me.</i>

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:23.977
Hi, Helen. Table for two?

01:23:24.477 --> 01:23:27.323
No. It's just me.

01:23:27.423 --> 01:23:28.882
Coffee to go, please.

01:23:28.982 --> 01:23:30.592
- Great.
- Thank you.

01:24:13.693 --> 01:24:15.356
Hey.

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.866
It's nice out?

01:24:24.704 --> 01:24:26.466
Yes.

01:24:27.991 --> 01:24:29.824
Beautiful.

01:24:32.445 --> 01:24:35.946
Yeah, it's sunny so it's nice.

01:24:37.684 --> 01:24:39.955
Just perfect.

01:24:51.381 --> 01:24:53.621
I'll miss you.

01:25:06.312 --> 01:25:08.423
Where will you go?

01:25:09.249 --> 01:25:12.134
I don't know. Away, I guess.

01:25:14.836 --> 01:25:17.821
Away sounds good.

01:25:23.729 --> 01:25:25.595
And you?

01:25:27.334 --> 01:25:29.369
Back to Toronto.

01:25:29.469 --> 01:25:31.564
Back to work.

01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:39.983
Back to life, I guess.

01:25:49.489 --> 01:25:52.168
You know, if you're
not doing anything...
