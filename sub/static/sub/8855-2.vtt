11:55.208 --> 11:56.917
GET OUT OF MY ROOM!

11:58.292 --> 12:01.125
Ed: MY BUTTOCKS HURT!

12:03.875 --> 12:05.625
WHY DOES GOO FLOAT?

12:05.708 --> 12:08.375
HIT THE ROAD!

12:10.667 --> 12:12.167
Eddy: MY LAMP!

12:12.000 --> 12:16.083
EDDY, WHY DON'T BIRDS
JUST TAKE A BUS SOUTH
FOR THE WINTER?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.833
Ed: EDDY? WHEN YOU
CLOSE THE FRIDGE DOOR,

12:20.917 --> 12:24.042
DOES THE LITTLE
LIGHT STAY ON?

12:24.125 --> 12:25.167
GO HOME!

12:25.000 --> 12:27.917
Ed: HELLO, LIGHT.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.708
HELLO, LIGHT.

12:30.792 --> 12:34.125
HELLO, LIGHT.

12:34.208 --> 12:36.667
HELLO, LIGHT.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.167
HELLO, LIGHT.

12:40.875 --> 12:43.667
Ed: EDDY, CARROTS
ARE GOOD FOR YOUR EYES.

12:43.750 --> 12:44.833
CAN IT DIAL A PHONE?

12:44.917 --> 12:47.250
IF YOU'RE GOING TO STRAIN
YOUR PEANUT BRAIN,

12:47.333 --> 12:48.792
THINK OF SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT,

12:48.875 --> 12:52.625
LIKE...HOW TO GET
YOUR FACE ON A DOLLAR BILL!

12:52.708 --> 12:56.875
EDDIE, WHY IS SOMEONE
IN THE KITCHEN WITH DINAH?

12:56.958 --> 13:01.125
UH--DOUBLE-D
UP YET?

13:01.792 --> 13:03.875
Edd: INTRIGUING.

13:03.958 --> 13:05.042
SLOWLY...

13:05.125 --> 13:08.083
HOW EMBARRASSING!

13:08.167 --> 13:11.042
SEEMS TO BE A 15-AMP
RESISTOR!

13:11.125 --> 13:12.500
HA HA! WHO WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT?

13:12.583 --> 13:15.208
MY, I LOVE
KNOWLEDGE!

13:15.042 --> 13:16.000
HEY, DOUBLE-D!

13:16.083 --> 13:19.875
EDDY, YOU KNOW
I HATE THAT!

13:19.958 --> 13:21.083
OH, HELLO, ED.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.500
WHAT YOU DOING
TO THIS TOASTER?

13:22.583 --> 13:26.167
BUSTED OR WHAT?
WHERE'S THE TOAST
GO, ANYWAY?

13:26.000 --> 13:29.750
FIRST OF ALL, EDDY,
TOAST DOESN'T GO
IN A TOASTER--

13:29.833 --> 13:31.042
BREAD DOES.

13:31.125 --> 13:33.125
SECOND, IT'S ACTUALLY
AN ANTIQUE RADIO.

13:33.208 --> 13:38.167
I DISASSEMBLED IT, EDDY,
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
HOW IT WORKED.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.833
YOU'RE RIGHT,
DOUBLE-D.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.542
THINK HOW IF WE
KNEW EVERYTHING,
WE WOULD BE--

13:42.625 --> 13:46.208
IF WE KNEW EVERYTHING,
WE WOULD BE SO FAMOUS!

13:46.292 --> 13:49.458
WAIT! YEAH--
AND RICH!

13:49.542 --> 13:50.833
LIKE POTATO SALAD?

13:50.917 --> 13:51.792
WELL--

13:51.875 --> 13:53.958
I SEE JAWBREAKERS--
LOADS OF 'EM!

13:54.042 --> 13:55.542
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS,

13:55.625 --> 13:56.708
BUT LET'S LEARN!

13:56.792 --> 13:59.583
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!
LET'S GET EDUCATED!

13:59.667 --> 14:02.833
SHALL WE BEGIN OUR
JOURNEY OF KNOWLEDGE
AT ED'S HOUSE?

14:02.917 --> 14:06.292
WE'RE GONNA BE EGGHEADS!
RICH EGGHEADS!

14:06.375 --> 14:08.792
CLUCK CLUCK
CLUCK CLUCK!

14:12.125 --> 14:12.958
EGADS!

14:13.042 --> 14:15.042
Eddy: GARAGES
ARE FOR CARS, ED.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.042
Ed: WHY, THANK YOU!

14:16.125 --> 14:17.208
Edd: WHERE DO
WE BEGIN?

14:17.042 --> 14:21.917
Ed: OH! I KNOW! LET'S
TAKE THIS APART FIRST!

14:23.167 --> 14:24.208
UH--EDDY?

14:24.292 --> 14:26.333
Ed: LOOK AT WHAT
I FOUND--

14:26.417 --> 14:31.417
ONE EDDY AND A WHOLE
BUNCH OF DOOHICKEYS!

14:31.500 --> 14:33.042
I TOOK IT APART,
DOUBLE-D.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.042
AM I SMART NOW?

14:34.125 --> 14:36.125
LET'S NOT ASK
FOR MIRACLES, ED.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.208
YOU'RE ENJOYING
THIS, AREN'T YOU?

14:38.042 --> 14:40.792
AH! AND WHAT'S
THIS?

14:40.875 --> 14:44.208
SPIN IT, ED,
AND LEARN!

14:45.083 --> 14:47.458
IT'S A FACE
SCRUNCHER! COOL!

14:47.542 --> 14:50.875
LET'S SEE WHAT MAKES
THIS OLD DRESSER TICK!

14:50.958 --> 14:54.292
WHOO-HOO! PG-13!

14:54.375 --> 14:56.542
THAT'S MY MOM'S,
EDDY.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.000
UGGH!

14:58.083 --> 15:00.875
HA HA! OH, DEAR!

15:00.958 --> 15:02.167
I HAVEN'T LEARNED
A THING!

15:02.000 --> 15:04.083
COME ON. LET'S
FIND SOME MORE STUFF!

15:04.167 --> 15:05.792
EDDY, MUST YOU BE
SO ROUGH?

15:05.875 --> 15:08.125
IS IT MY TURN
TO JUMP ON YOUR HEAD?

15:08.208 --> 15:11.125
LET'S JUST FOLLOW
EDDY, ED.

15:11.208 --> 15:13.375
FOLLOW THE LEADER!

15:14.083 --> 15:16.833
Rolf: GERTRUDE--
EGGS FOR ROLF?

15:16.917 --> 15:18.958
OH! NOT AGAIN!

15:19.042 --> 15:21.125
HOW MANY TIMES
MUST ROLF REPEAT
HIMSELF?

15:21.208 --> 15:23.208
NO STRANGE VISITORS,
EVER!

15:23.292 --> 15:26.042
Rolf: DO NOT BURN
THE CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS,

15:26.125 --> 15:27.917
AS IT LEADS TO THE LIFE
OF A HAIRDRESSER!

15:28.000 --> 15:28.958
Edd: THE PLYWOOD
OF THIS COOP

15:29.042 --> 15:31.125
HAS SOME VERY UNUSUAL
CHARACTERISTICS.

15:31.208 --> 15:32.208
Eddy: WOW...WOOD.

15:32.042 --> 15:33.125
Rolf: ED BOYS!

15:33.208 --> 15:36.292
WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE
THE MYSTERIES OF LIFE!

15:36.375 --> 15:40.042
THIS REMINDS ROLF
OF A FABLE FROM
HIS OLD COUNTRY.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.292
HERE WE GO!

15:41.375 --> 15:44.708
THE STORY OF THE UGLY BOY
AND THE TREE OF HEADS.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.958
OK, WELL, IT'S BEEN
SWELL, ROLFIE BOY,

15:47.042 --> 15:48.042
BUT WE'RE OUT
OF HERE!

15:48.125 --> 15:50.042
LIFE TOO SHORT NOT
TO SMELL THE PARSNIP!

15:50.125 --> 15:53.208
OK...ONCE UPON A TIME,
AN UGLY BOY WAS

15:53.292 --> 15:57.667
THROWN OUT OF HIS
VILLAGE AND HIT HIS
MELON ON A TREE.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.458
THE BOY LOOKED UP
AND WAS AMAZED

15:59.542 --> 16:03.333
AT THE MANY BEAUTIFUL
HEADS GROWING
FROM ITS BRANCHES.

16:03.417 --> 16:04.250
HANDSOME!

16:04.333 --> 16:06.042
Rolf: AFTER MANY TRIES...

16:06.125 --> 16:07.708
Eddy: WHAT THE--

16:07.792 --> 16:11.125
HE FOUND ONE THAT FIT
AND RAN BACK TO THE VILLAGE.

16:11.208 --> 16:13.625
YES...HE BECAME
VERY POPULAR.

16:13.708 --> 16:16.292
I WANT A NEW HEAD,
PLEASE, ROLF!

16:16.375 --> 16:17.792
NEW HEAD!

16:17.875 --> 16:20.167
ROLF! HEAD FOR ED!

16:20.667 --> 16:24.583
Edd: WHAT A DISCOVERY!
IT'S FLAT AS CARDBOARD!

16:24.667 --> 16:27.000
GIMME THAT!

16:27.708 --> 16:29.792
HEAVY IN WEIGHT.
GOT IT!

16:29.875 --> 16:31.417
THANK YOU, EDDY!

16:35.083 --> 16:38.417
YOU GUYS GOTTA
SEE THIS!

16:39.125 --> 16:41.208
I'D BEST TEND
TO HIS MEDICAL NEEDS.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.625
EXCUSE ME.

16:42.708 --> 16:44.792
MY TURN TO JUMP
ON HIS HEAD!

16:44.875 --> 16:47.042
LIFE HAS MANY DOORS,
ED BOY!

16:47.125 --> 16:50.875
OH! BIG...TREE...
FLAT...

16:54.208 --> 16:56.000
EINSTEIN'S GOT NOTHING
ON THIS!

16:56.083 --> 16:58.750
WHAT A DISCOVERY!
I'M SPEECHLESS!

16:58.833 --> 17:00.042
I MEAN, THIS IS
AN ABSOLUTE COUP--

17:00.125 --> 17:02.000
THE DISPLACEMENT OF
PERSPECTIVE! WHY--

17:02.083 --> 17:04.125
THOUGHT YOU WERE
SPEECHLESS?

17:04.208 --> 17:06.583
LOOK AT ME RUN!

17:07.917 --> 17:09.042
OH, GREAT!

17:09.125 --> 17:12.000
THE PAVEMENT HAS ADAPTED
FABRIC-LIKE QUALITIES!

17:12.083 --> 17:13.667
INTERESTING.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.958
HE'LL NEVER FIND
HIS WAY OUT!

17:17.042 --> 17:18.125
I SAY WE TAKE
A BREAK.

17:18.208 --> 17:21.500
THIS LEARNING STUFF IS
MAKING ME HUNGRY.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.292
DID YOU SEE THAT?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.000
WEIRD! OH, WELL.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.083
CAN'T BEAT 'EM,
EAT 'EM!

17:27.167 --> 17:28.250
NOT BAD!

17:28.333 --> 17:32.167
JUMPIN' JEHOSHOPHAT!
WHO TURNED OUT THE SUN?

17:32.250 --> 17:34.167
HI, JIMMY!

17:36.250 --> 17:37.250
LIGHTEN UP, SHRIMP!

17:37.333 --> 17:40.667
WE'RE JUST FIGURING
OUT HOW STUFF WORKS.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.292
Eddy: A THREAD?

17:45.167 --> 17:46.250
Eddy: WHAT THE--

17:46.333 --> 17:48.792
WOO HOO!

17:48.875 --> 17:51.292
IS THAT
JIMMY'S OUTLINE?

17:52.542 --> 17:53.667
LET'S SELL IT

17:53.750 --> 17:58.333

A CRUEL HAND! DARN IT!

17:58.417 --> 18:01.792
COME, EDDY.
YOU'D BEST NOT
AGGRAVATE IT!

18:01.875 --> 18:04.625
LIKE MY NEW HAIRDO,

18:04.708 --> 18:08.000

TO HAVE STUMBLED

18:33.958 --> 18:35.375
INTO ANOTHER
DIMENSION!

18:35.458 --> 18:39.167
I FEEL WE'RE GETTING
CLOSER TO ANSWERING
THAT ALL-IMPORTANT QUESTION!

18:39.250 --> 18:40.875
IS EDDY RICH YET?

18:40.958 --> 18:43.208
CAN ED GO

18:55.167 --> 18:58.542
Sarah: EDDY, YOU
BLOCKHEAD!

18:59.167 --> 19:01.208

HOVERING JUST OVERHEAD.

19:10.958 --> 19:14.333
I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.
PARDON ME.
