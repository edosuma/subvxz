01:36.880 --> 01:40.714
CONFETTI HARVEST

02:03.680 --> 02:05.318
What's this now?

02:17.480 --> 02:19.357
Did you arrange this?

02:20.400 --> 02:21.389
Who are they?

02:21.560 --> 02:24.518
No more room in the campgrounds
and there's a sick boy with them.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.514
He doesn't exactly look sick.
-He did up close.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.158
Did you talk to these people
dressed like that?

02:35.360 --> 02:36.679
We'll never get rid of them.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.679
What are they doing?
-Got water.

02:44.840 --> 02:48.833
Why didn't you call us?
-l didn't want to disturb the afternoon nap.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.276
l was awake anyway, so l thought...
-Didn't you realize...

02:52.440 --> 02:55.716
...we're not free with strangers in our yard.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.269
They'll have to use the toilet.
-Ah, well.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.392
Problem solved.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.313
Let's send them away.
-Well, that's a bit harsh.

03:13.880 --> 03:18.829
...who'd recognize their best works
as glaring sins?

03:20.680 --> 03:22.989
Who have forfeited everything?

03:24.200 --> 03:26.634
Who take the Lord for their refreshment?

03:29.400 --> 03:30.719
There are still seats.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.150
Are there still those
who are far from the Lord?

03:34.800 --> 03:36.438
Are any among you called?

03:41.320 --> 03:45.552
Are there those among you
who welcome death?

03:46.400 --> 03:49.312
Because only after death true life awaits us.

03:55.800 --> 04:00.794
Believe that the precious blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ...

04:00.960 --> 04:06.512
...has been spilled to atone for our sins.

04:06.680 --> 04:10.036
We've strayed from the path to salvation...

04:10.200 --> 04:14.910
...because we lack the strength
to choose the narrow road.

04:15.680 --> 04:20.117
We don't have enough strength
to remain on the narrow road...

04:20.839 --> 04:22.671
...until death...

04:23.840 --> 04:25.956
...when true Life awaits us...

04:26.720 --> 04:28.676
...beside Him who we love above
everything.

04:29.920 --> 04:34.596
That we die to be able to be reborn.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.634
Raise your heart to the Lord.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.911
Katelijne.
-Hello, sir.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.197
l can't win with this skirt.
-Sure you can.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.790
Amen.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.792
So what were the points, guys?

06:30.080 --> 06:31.433
Well?

06:33.600 --> 06:35.795
The three points of God's sacred law.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.239
The Law curse the sinner.
The Law damn the sinner.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.029
And...

06:48.760 --> 06:51.035
The Law kill the sinner.

06:54.600 --> 06:59.196
The tractor's fuel is almost gone again.
-Yes, it's a guzzler.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.591
I'll top it up tomorrow.
-I'll do it.

07:02.760 --> 07:05.638
Let Rogier do it.
-Rogier?

07:05.800 --> 07:08.553
Dad, he was riding around
Like a maniac yesterday.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.517
So what did you see me do?

07:10.680 --> 07:12.796
Zigzagging Like a drunk.
-Nonsense.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.598
Hey, hey.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.638
You're lucky that barn's still there.
-Do you learn that arguing in church?

07:18.240 --> 07:21.118
Name one thing you saw me do.
-That's enough.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.239
<i>my help comes</i>

07:28.400 --> 07:33.872
<i>only from the Lord</i>

07:34.040 --> 07:40.229
<i>Who heaven, sea and earth</i>

07:41.200 --> 07:42.918
<i>created</i>

07:43.080 --> 07:48.029
<i>and preserved ever since</i>

07:50.280 --> 07:52.316
When l have money, I'm going to Canada.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.560
Apparently, farms are much bigger
over there.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.830
Canada!

08:07.040 --> 08:09.679
Canada!

08:10.720 --> 08:12.756
Canada!

08:12.920 --> 08:15.309
Canada!

08:26.480 --> 08:28.038
Katelijne!

08:41.880 --> 08:43.313
Katelijne.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.275
Stubborn as a mule.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.870
Did you use this one down there?

09:11.560 --> 09:12.913
That's my washcloth.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.190
Luckily, I'm clean both down and up.

09:20.760 --> 09:21.875
Yuck.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.159
Satan, the killer of humans
from the beginning of time...

09:31.320 --> 09:35.711
...will do his utmost to pull you
off the straight and narrow.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.155
Keep in mind, children, at your new
schools...

09:38.320 --> 09:42.871
...you'll be exposed to his temptations.
Yes?

09:43.400 --> 09:46.198
Satan wants us to read different books.
-Yes.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.510
About us descending from apes.
-Right.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.478
And fairy tales.
-Exactly.

09:52.680 --> 09:56.229
Fairy tales are expressions
of pagan stories.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.552
Satan always looks for something
that's dear to your heart.

10:03.920 --> 10:07.754
Don't be too quick to think
that music has no hold on you.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.957
There's something in music that tempts
you.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.029
And now...

10:41.480 --> 10:43.038
Satanic texts.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.075
They discovered in America
that the subconscious...

10:47.240 --> 10:49.800
...can decipher Satanic texts.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.151
l will rise

11:05.680 --> 11:08.114
I'm your sire Satan

11:24.360 --> 11:28.512
There are also a lot of songs about sex, but
l don't have an example of that right now.

11:28.680 --> 11:33.595
<i>Gods word stands firm throughout eternity</i>

11:33.760 --> 11:38.550
<i>it will not budge an inch</i>

11:38.720 --> 11:40.392
<i>Satan</i>...

12:13.040 --> 12:15.031
Look, this is a cow.

12:16.040 --> 12:20.352
When the cow eats a dandelion
it will first go down into the rumen.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.193
Then into the reticulum,
followed by the omasum.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.749
And lastly into the abomasum.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.319
It's over here.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.353
And over there.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.595
When the cow poops,
the dandelion is still yellow.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.712
Go and have a Look
when dad turns on the mixers.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.989
They float all the way to the top.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.236
Kat...

13:13.840 --> 13:17.469
Ro, I'm warning you.
A child doesn't belong in a cafÃ©.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.756
Straight back home after shopping.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.636
It's not for us. Come on.

14:16.680 --> 14:20.832
l was wearing my coveralls and my cap
when l tripped on a ham.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.276
A ham this big.
l thought: I'll carry it inside.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.113
Look at all that ice-cream.
Eat it before it melts.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.670
And the coffee.
-With everything. I'm not a cheap date.

14:31.880 --> 14:36.158
l cut a piece off that ham, tasted it
and l grimaced.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.919
Sea salt.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.152
Then l knew it had been a pig
with erysipeloid.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.309
They hope that by cooking it in seawater
you wouldn't find out about it.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.790
Later on l heard that the reverend
had gotten a piece first.

14:48.960 --> 14:52.589
l assume that if it hadn't ended well for him
salvation would still await him.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.078
Grandpa?
-Yes?

15:06.240 --> 15:08.276
Is that story about the ham true?

15:09.280 --> 15:11.714
Grandma thought the Lord had sent it.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.039
Who knows?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.392
You're filthy.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.633
It's over.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.633
The fumes.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.558
What mischief did you get up to?

19:34.720 --> 19:36.597
He was looking for dandelions.

19:37.320 --> 19:41.518
What were you thinking? You know
how dangerous that manure pit is.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.998
What will become of our body?

20:15.160 --> 20:18.152
It returns to dust and the worms will eat it.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.912
Who shall be called rich?

20:20.080 --> 20:22.036
Those who have stored up
a treasure in heaven.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.792
Who want to leave the world?

20:23.960 --> 20:25.791
Those who are heirs to the Lord.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.552
Who are the happiest people?

20:27.720 --> 20:32.635
Those who desire no greater happiness
than doing the will of God.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.751
Who are the unhappiest?

20:35.920 --> 20:38.036
Those who follow their own will.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.638
What will be their end?

20:40.800 --> 20:42.472
Eternal damnation.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.790
What will be the end of the pious?

20:44.960 --> 20:47.520
Eternal salvation and glory. Amen.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.195
It's the tough, narrow road
which leads to the Lord.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.392
The broad road is more pleasant and
easier.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.358
Which is why many of us take that road.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.750
Unfortunately, l add.

21:20.960 --> 21:25.556
And from his throne,
the Lord will address them.

21:25.720 --> 21:30.316
And to them he says:
l never knew you.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.038
''Away from me.''

21:36.560 --> 21:40.519
Our thoughts are with the wife and family
of Mr. Minderhoud.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.229
That's what happens...

21:42.400 --> 21:45.756
...when you find your business more
important than your salvation.

21:45.920 --> 21:51.199
No sign or anything that he ended up well?

21:51.360 --> 21:53.669
No one has seen or noticed anything.

21:53.840 --> 21:59.870
Small is the gate and narrow the road to Life
and only a few find it.

22:01.440 --> 22:05.115
Are you ever troubled by your sins?
-Oh, that child.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.477
She doesn't want to hear it,
but even green leaves fall sometimes...

22:08.640 --> 22:10.119
...and then it's too late.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.638
BIBLE

22:53.880 --> 22:55.836
Tea, child?
-Yes, please.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.516
Those who want to get wet
should walk in the rain.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.398
Those who want to be saved...

23:22.800 --> 23:24.677
Oh, child...

23:24.840 --> 23:28.719
Suppose you were to experience that too?
Attaining salvation?

23:29.760 --> 23:31.910
Wouldn't that be a miracle?

23:35.560 --> 23:38.836
l used to be just Like you:
living from one day to the next.

23:42.760 --> 23:47.436
lf your grandpa had just tried harder,
he might have ended up well.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.272
Shall we read?

23:59.080 --> 24:01.469
Guys, enough dilly-dallying.
Get to work.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.993
The cows won't wait.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.391
She's from the farm
where he was an intern.

24:24.560 --> 24:28.030
She's from the seceders.
They're more strict than us.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.150
Jannemieke sleeps in your bed
this weekend.

24:31.320 --> 24:35.393
Otherwise she'll have to cross the water
to Terneuzen tonight.

24:35.560 --> 24:39.917
Jannemieke? Katelijne can give you a tour
once you've tidied up.

24:53.520 --> 24:57.638
She can serve as an example to you.
-Jannemieke?

24:57.800 --> 25:00.439
With her you can tell she's different.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.718
We have to be strangers on earth.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.195
People have to be able to tell
by your actions...

25:12.360 --> 25:16.478
...your face, your words
and by the way you dress.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.519
I'll do it.

25:37.960 --> 25:41.191
Have you really never had a haircut?
-No, we're not allowed.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.954
Ouch!

25:44.360 --> 25:46.157
Ouch.
-Sorry.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.510
Now you've got the sister you always
wanted.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.033
Sleep well.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.794
Again?

27:29.840 --> 27:31.671
Maybe you'll go to my school.

27:32.640 --> 27:33.834
In the laundromat?

27:35.280 --> 27:36.759
l attend school every Monday, you know.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.878
Don't forget: Blessed are the ignorant.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.399
You can read as much as you want, but
if you don't Learn the most important thing...

27:45.560 --> 27:47.312
...you are only a clanging cymbal.

27:49.480 --> 27:50.799
Mom?

27:52.720 --> 27:55.871
Do you think l really have to go
to Jannemieke's school?

27:56.040 --> 27:58.190
We'll see.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.113
You can't count on the weather forecast
for one bit.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.471
Guys, just one more minute
and we'll read the Bible.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.872
Katelijne was Looking.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.473
l wouldn't let Rogier slobber all over me.

29:46.040 --> 29:49.430
Come on, lazybones.
Don't make me come up again.

29:57.480 --> 29:58.708
You?

30:03.000 --> 30:03.796
Jeroen's.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.119
Empty again?

30:46.680 --> 30:48.750
l might come even more often next year.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.115
Having another one?
-Yes.

30:51.280 --> 30:55.876
The doctor was against it,
because she always needs a caesarean.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.439
But, ah well...

30:58.320 --> 31:00.311
I've been a naughty boy.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.313
The ninth is it?
-No, the tenth.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.869
They might as well put in a zipper.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.319
See you.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.312
I'll give the place a good cleaning.
It's usually just half done, l think.

31:17.680 --> 31:21.832
Katelijne, can you go and see
whether the sheep still have enough water?.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.399
Yes.

32:03.320 --> 32:04.389
No!

32:26.280 --> 32:28.510
You have to help me.
-Rogier, Christiaan...

32:28.680 --> 32:29.829
...get down here!

33:12.000 --> 33:13.399
Yeah...

33:14.080 --> 33:17.117
...a tidy counter and a clean toilet...

33:17.280 --> 33:19.840
...are the signs of a good housewife.

35:00.040 --> 35:03.077
Yes... that's what l mean.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.470
At least you understood.

35:20.800 --> 35:24.509
The water was very black after scrubbing.

35:24.680 --> 35:30.516
l refreshed the water three times
and each time it was very black again.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.989
She's quite capable.

35:36.960 --> 35:41.636
Guys, just cut off the black part.
It gives you cancer.

36:31.080 --> 36:31.956
Hi.

37:07.920 --> 37:11.435
l heard that the teacher has a TV as well.
-Not true.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.079
Hidden in a cupboard.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.437
When the elders visit,
he quickly locks the door.

37:16.600 --> 37:17.919
Not.

37:22.080 --> 37:25.595
l can smell you were with the cows.
-Not.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.871
A letter from the teacher.

38:04.720 --> 38:05.948
It smells in here.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.434
Christiaan?

38:25.880 --> 38:28.599
A sick cow needs a shot.

38:28.760 --> 38:30.990
l can't Leave now,
but it's at the veterinarian's.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.515
Fine, I'll go.
-Can l come?

38:33.680 --> 38:35.671
To Canada?
-lf you don't have anything else to do.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.157
We can go for an ice-cream.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.193
l don't want one.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.717
But it's so hot.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.077
<i>It</i>'<i>s a cut above, ladies and gentlemen</i>.

39:08.240 --> 39:11.550
<i>It</i>'<i>s Sensational Enterprise</i>.
<i>Step right up</i>.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.752
Minderhoud, going out with your girlfriend?
-It's my sister.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.309
What are you doing here?
-Driving shit. Satisfied?

39:25.480 --> 39:27.789
l can smell it. No time to wash?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.318
Watch your mouth, OK?

39:30.480 --> 39:33.711
Feel Like having a drink?
-No, we're going for ice-cream.

39:33.880 --> 39:34.995
Here, have a sip.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.713
Look, there's Levine Fagmachine.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.916
Chasing small kids again.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.710
Want a sip?
-Is there alcohol in it?

39:47.880 --> 39:51.190
Only a tiny amount of beer was in it,
but that's gone.

39:51.360 --> 39:53.635
You?
-Throw it in the bin.

39:53.800 --> 39:57.588
Why the rush?
Let's just walk around for a bit.

39:59.640 --> 40:03.952
This is really awesome.
You really have to experience it once.

42:27.440 --> 42:28.395
You've been found out.

42:29.760 --> 42:34.834
Kee Dominisse saw you getting out of one
of those revolving things with flashing lights.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.468
She said you looked as sick as a dog.

42:39.720 --> 42:43.156
What else have you been up to?
-Nothing.

42:49.680 --> 42:54.151
l raised you properly,
so don't act as if you didn't Learn anything.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.639
No.

42:56.880 --> 42:59.440
I'll ask your father to give you
a good spanking.

42:59.600 --> 43:01.272
Maybe that will teach you.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.312
Don't Look so impudent.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.677
Just my luck to have one Like you.

43:47.360 --> 43:49.271
Say: parallelepiped.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.508
Palle...

43:53.360 --> 43:54.509
Palle...

43:55.280 --> 43:56.952
Pallallepiped.

44:00.160 --> 44:02.674
And: industrial wastewater treatment
centre.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.910
You moved your head back.

44:27.680 --> 44:30.956
You're just pushing it in deeper.
-No, I'm not.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.432
It's the only thing l can do.

44:55.200 --> 44:57.191
Cindy has slender fingers.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.998
Not sausages Like yours.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.913
Lady hands that are only fit
to pick up cutlery.

45:02.080 --> 45:05.072
l bet she's never earthed up a potato.

45:05.240 --> 45:07.310
You can never have
a normal conversation.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.832
Come here with your face.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.753
There's a huge blackhead on your nose.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.549
Petra and Eline always lie on their back
Like this too, you know.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.314
When their parents
go to the city on Thursdays...

45:37.320 --> 45:41.757
...they lie naked on the yellow bedspread
in their parents' bedroom...

45:41.920 --> 45:45.629
...to try to get a suntan,
because they think they're too pale.

45:47.440 --> 45:50.716
Didn't you ever notice they Look
a bit yellowish on Fridays?

45:51.680 --> 45:53.398
Never paid attention to it.

45:53.560 --> 45:56.120
I'll take a Look tomorrow.
-You should.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.036
Once...

46:02.200 --> 46:05.476
...when they were home alone,
a man drove up the driveway.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.473
He got out.

46:23.240 --> 46:24.832
He was a drug addict.

46:26.840 --> 46:28.239
Honestly.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.351
He looked in every window.

46:31.520 --> 46:34.956
Petra and Eveline were
in their parents' bedroom, of course.

46:41.280 --> 46:44.795
You smell weird, by the way.
-Then what happened?

46:44.960 --> 46:46.393
Then...

46:46.560 --> 46:49.233
Then they could only come up with one
thing.

47:03.440 --> 47:05.317
That guy took off Like a bat out of hell.

47:13.040 --> 47:16.112
When their parents came home,
they were still barking.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.518
l was thinking...

47:24.680 --> 47:27.114
When you go to Canada,
I'll come with you.

47:29.960 --> 47:32.918
Were they still naked?
-When?

47:34.160 --> 47:37.596
When their parents returned.

47:37.760 --> 47:40.433
l guess. I'm not exactly sure.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.879
They must have been.

47:49.400 --> 47:53.473
They must have thought he was still there
and didn't dare move.

48:09.040 --> 48:10.792
Were they on their backs
or on their stomachs?

48:10.960 --> 48:13.758
How should l know?
l wasn't there, was l?

48:23.040 --> 48:24.792
I'm going to the village.

49:37.440 --> 49:40.955
Demolished it again, moron.
-You are the moron here.

49:42.960 --> 49:44.757
That's the last time l lent you something.

49:51.280 --> 49:54.113
Ask if you can ride his ZÃ¼ndapp.
-No chance.

49:54.280 --> 49:56.874
What if l ask him?
-What business is it of yours?

49:58.680 --> 50:02.116
Coming, guys? Christiaan's acting stupid.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.309
Cindy?

50:36.080 --> 50:37.832
Cindy, come on.

51:03.520 --> 51:06.637
And then Gerrit came with his crippled leg
and everyone stood up.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.476
Ready? Are you?

51:21.680 --> 51:24.399
Make sure you behave.
-l will.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.750
You Look Like your mom, you know.

51:56.920 --> 51:59.912
She had the same radiant smile
when she was young.

52:01.280 --> 52:04.670
When your dad saw her for the first time
we were sitting in the garden.

52:04.840 --> 52:07.434
Your mom in her short blue dress.

52:08.160 --> 52:11.311
She was radiant, the way you are now.

52:11.480 --> 52:12.708
My mom?
-Yes.

52:12.880 --> 52:15.348
That's when she met your dad.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.439
Really.

52:26.240 --> 52:27.832
Aunt?
-Yes?

52:28.000 --> 52:29.877
They're not allowed to wear pants.

52:30.040 --> 52:31.712
Oh? Why not?

52:33.080 --> 52:34.593
They're men's clothes.

52:35.880 --> 52:38.917
A woman in men's clothes
is an abomination to the Lord.

52:39.080 --> 52:41.036
Pink pants are men's clothes?

52:44.400 --> 52:45.719
A little bit.

53:04.440 --> 53:06.749
Gloria, Look, my cousin.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.514
Are these fairy tales?

53:43.680 --> 53:46.433
Yes, very famous ones.

53:48.200 --> 53:49.679
Pagan stories.

53:52.680 --> 53:54.511
The witch with the potato face...

53:54.680 --> 53:56.989
...said the girl had to remove all the lentils
from the ashes...

53:57.160 --> 53:59.549
...or she couldn't go to the ball.

53:59.720 --> 54:03.918
Fortunately, the pigeons helped her
and she was done on time.

54:04.080 --> 54:07.038
Actually, pigeons can't help.
Don't believe that.

54:07.200 --> 54:08.997
But you can for now.

54:09.840 --> 54:14.277
A ball doesn't suit our lifestyle
and neither does showing off.

54:16.160 --> 54:17.832
Everyone to her own bed now.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.513
Sleep well.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.319
Look...

55:55.040 --> 55:56.189
Well, well.

55:59.400 --> 56:00.389
Very nice.

56:21.440 --> 56:23.556
Did you find that book?

56:32.920 --> 56:35.912
Oh, lamb. Did you hurt yourself?

56:39.680 --> 56:41.910
Wonderful.

56:48.880 --> 56:50.632
You Look Like me when l was young.

56:51.080 --> 56:53.389
Wait, I'll style your hair.

57:35.520 --> 57:36.509
Open your eyes.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.278
Darling, you're a beauty.
Take it from me.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.513
Have a Look.

58:10.680 --> 58:14.639
No, I've never had a short blue dress.
She's mistaken.

58:32.520 --> 58:34.795
Huh? Who can that be?

58:35.960 --> 58:37.951
They'll probably be here all night.

58:42.840 --> 58:43.829
Christiaan?

58:49.880 --> 58:51.199
Christiaan?

58:51.840 --> 58:53.319
Christiaan?

59:00.680 --> 59:03.274
You go and play outside.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.793
You can't be here.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.316
That's dangerous, stupid asshole.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.799
Guys?

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.879
Guys, Christiaan's getting married.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.958
Come on. Everyone to bed.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.479
Amen.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.480
I'll start with the announcements.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.758
First: Next week there will be
a collection for the building fund.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.229
Second: Christiaan Minderhoud
and Pieternella Cornelia Davidse...

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.109
...made a confession of guilt
to the church council last week...

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.192
...for breaking the Seventh Commandment.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:28.949
We'll continue the service
by singing Psalm 51 verse 1 and 4.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.638
Behold my remorse.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.916
Hear how a penitent pleads.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.595
And cleanse me from all my dirty sins.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:47.351
<i>have mercy on me, O God</i>

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:54.517
<i>according to your unfailing love</i>

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.470
<i>according to your great compassion</i>

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:07.956
<i>blot out my transgressions</i>

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:17.429
<i>against you, you only, have l sinned</i>

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.639
<i>and done what is evil in your sight</i>

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.033
Hello.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.199
Hello.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.718
Are you by yourself?

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.872
Yes. And you?

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.277
Are those your parents?

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.512
Yes. We live nearby.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.114
Where do you live?
-The Hague.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.114
Aren't you married?

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.319
Not anymore.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.436
lf no one's waiting for you anyway...

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.351
...would you consider...

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.749
What would l consider?
-Well...

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.719
...me moving in with you.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.313
Do you really want to?

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.716
Really?
-Really.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.519
And in bed?

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.716
How are you in bed?

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.359
What?

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.556
Can you spread your legs really wide?

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.517
Or are you too small for that?

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.471
Why were you talking to that man?
Do you know him?

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.313
Do you talk to strangers now?
Brazen hussy.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.878
She's not one of ours.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.998
Come on, let's go.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.350
Zip it up, we're leaving.
-Hurry!

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.159
Zip it up, we're leaving.
-Shut your ugly face.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.432
l didn't get this voice for nothing.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.875
The reverend says
we have to use our talents.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.988
See? It worked.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.512
Luckily, I'm more faithful to God
than to people.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.480
We'll have to come up
with something else soon.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.475
But Christaan's found a job with
a harvest company, so we can afford it.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.799
Do you Like living in the village now?
-Terribly.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.515
Really?

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.039
What do you want?
-Want some lemonade?

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.159
l should go, actually.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.879
It prickles.

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:38.033
Her report card wasn't as good
as last year's.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.633
That could be right.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.759
l have to admit that l was stingy
in handing out A's.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.639
An A+ may make you think you're perfect.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.109
Kids these days think
they're quite something.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:54.796
They compare grades
and thumb their nose at each other.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.758
As long as such a school
doesn't alienate her from us.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.319
Or from God.

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:01.232
Let's take it step by step.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:04.631
This report card allows her to take
advanced high school in Goes.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.234
Hey, stop making a racket.

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:17.192
It should be possible here.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.876
First remove that tractor.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:27.832
Was my teacher here last night?
-He just wouldn't Leave.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.956
He was still here at 1 1:30.

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:41.870
What did he want?
-Can't you see we're busy, Katelijne?

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.029
Yes!

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.515
Did my teacher say anything yesterday?
-He just wouldn't Leave.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.595
But no wonder. There's no one
waiting for him at home.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.118
Was that necessary?

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.353
Your garden is beautiful.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.598
It is.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.196
l didn't think it would be,
after the spring we had.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.670
l wouldn't mind opening up my garden
to other garden devotees.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.319
That's a great idea, mom.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.708
That garden is your idol.
Why don't you grow cabbage or peas.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.830
The Lord has to wax and l have to wane.
That's the way it is.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.632
All that reading.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.353
It will make you as simple as a goat.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.670
Clean some chairs for the party.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.475
OK, go ahead.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.791
l went with Petra again yesterday,
so she could try on the dress.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.428
But Petra says I'm not allowed to tell.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.239
That material is so soft.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.358
Does it have hoops?
-I'm not allowed to tell.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.353
I'm just allowed to say it's stunning.
-Which colour?

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.512
Man, my arm hurts.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.833
What do you think?

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.788
It's a shame grandpa isn't here for this.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:35.040
When l think about it, Katelijne, l think:
l wonder how he's doing.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.394
l wonder where he is.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.677
l don't dare to think about him
ending up so badly.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:52.109
And you can't really say
that he had a wicked character. Right?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.831
He was always glad to help others.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.752
But that's human reasoning. That's...

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.397
l think that grandpa is better off
than you think.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.951
Remember when l went
to the city with grandpa?

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.391
Something strange happened
on the way home.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.635
You're familiar with the crossroads
at the flower meadow.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.631
There was an old woman there.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.875
At that exact moment,
grandpa heard singing.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.837
l heard nothing.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.390
Grandpa slowed down
to be able to hear it better.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.431
l still heard nothing.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:36.711
lf grandpa hadn't slowed down,
we'd both be dead.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.908
Ro never told me.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.595
But then he never told me anything.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.198
It reminded me right away of that psalm.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.511
'The Lord will rescue his servants.''

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.717
''The righteous person
may have many troubles.''

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:05.316
''But the Lord delivers him from them all.''

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.595
Yes, that one.

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:11.356
Grandpa said that that was the psalm
he'd heard at the crossroads.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.352
l didn't really talk to grandpa after that.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.557
And at the funeral,
l heard that psalm again.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.275
l didn't really dare to talk
to anyone about it.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.869
So here you are!

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.270
Have you lost your mind completely?

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.759
Do you know how much
still has to be done.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.112
Thank you for the cookie.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.557
l thank you too, child.

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:57.279
Christiaan?

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.038
Christiaan!

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.594
Chris!

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.193
Christiaan!

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.193
Christiaan!

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.270
Christiaan!

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.354
Chris!

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.033
Here!

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:59.955
In a marriage it's the husband's duty...

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.553
...as head of the wife...

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.472
...to teach her.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.959
And in addition he has to comfort...

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.559
...and protect her.

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.188
Thou woman...

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.118
...will obey your lawful husband in all
things.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:29.318
Because is it not true that Adam
was created first?

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:33.155
And after that Eve as Adam's handmaiden.

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.478
Like Sarah...

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.159
...who obeyed her husband Abraham.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.551
Naming him 'her Lord'.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:25.235
<i>as the hart panteth after the water</i>
<i>brooks</i>...

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.358
<i>my soul thirsteth for God</i>

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:52.868
<i>living God, O when</i>

01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:02.193
<i>shall l come and appear before God?</i>

01:21:03.305 --> 01:21:09.379
