Kane is in the building, nigga...

00:23.232 --> 00:26.474
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top

00:26.652 --> 00:30.440
When only heaven ’3 right above it, we on

00:30.531 --> 00:32.817
’Cause we on

00:32.909 --> 00:35.696
Who else real/y tryin’ to fuck
with Hollywood Cole?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.322
I’m with Marley G, bro

00:37.413 --> 00:40.405
Flying Holly Grove chicks
to my Hollywood shows

00:40.499 --> 00:43.536
And / wanna tell you
something that you probably should know

00:43.628 --> 00:46.711
This that
Slumdog Millionaire Bol/ywood flow

00:46.797 --> 00:48.253
And...

00:48.341 --> 00:50.377
My real friends never hearing from me

00:50.468 --> 00:53.505
Fake friends write the wrong
answers on the mirror for me

00:53.596 --> 00:56.713
That’s why / pick and choose
/ don ’t get shit confused

00:56.807 --> 01:00.220
Don ’t like my women sing/e
/ like my chicks in twos

01:00.311 --> 01:03.098
And these days
all the girls is down to roll

01:03.189 --> 01:05.555
/ hit the strip club
and all them bitches ﬁnd the pole

01:06.359 --> 01:09.442
Plus, lbeen sippin’
So this shit is movin’ kinda slow

01:09.528 --> 01:12.861
Just tell my girl
to tell her friend that it’s time to go

01:19.372 --> 01:21.488
(LAUGHING)

01:24.418 --> 01:25.453
Shit.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.455
You know what?
I still don't get it, man.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.707
-Me either.
-All right, it's real easy, guys.

01:29.799 --> 01:32.711
So annuity is a fixed sum of money
paid to someone every year,

01:32.802 --> 01:34.463
usually for the rest of their life.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.293
Like somebody would leave in a will?

01:36.389 --> 01:37.424
Exactly, brother.

01:37.515 --> 01:40.052
So let's say Vernon,
you die and you leave me 100k.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.098
-Let's say I don't.
-But let's say you do.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.767
Let me shed some more light.

01:44.230 --> 01:48.143
An annuity
is a contractual financial product

01:48.234 --> 01:50.316
sold by financial institutions

01:50.820 --> 01:55.655
that's designed to accept
and grow funds from an individual

01:55.741 --> 01:58.403
and then, upon annuitization,

01:58.494 --> 02:01.827
pay out a stream of payments
to the individual

02:01.914 --> 02:03.415
-at a later point in time.
-Ah!

02:03.499 --> 02:05.000
Hey, Eddie George, amazing!

02:05.209 --> 02:06.244
I know.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.996
lwas inspired by you, Spencer.

02:08.212 --> 02:11.045
I figured if you can do it, I can, too.

02:11.257 --> 02:12.417
-l'm out.
-All right.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.749
-Let's get some breakfast, y'all.
-l'm in.

02:14.844 --> 02:15.879
Let's, please.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.301
Some cheese and biscuits...

02:17.388 --> 02:18.594
Yo, what's that?

02:27.398 --> 02:30.265

03:16.155 --> 03:17.895
-You okay, boo boo?
-Never better.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.946
They're already in the conference room.

03:22.161 --> 03:24.026
-Oh.
-There he is.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.612
Spencer, say hi to Arielle and Andi.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.742
Hello, Arielle, Andi.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.085
They're from
the acquisitions team at IMG.

03:30.169 --> 03:32.205
Welcome, ladies.
It's good to meet you.

03:32.296 --> 03:33.752
Nice to finally meet you, too.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.830
Sorry I'm late.
I had a little car trouble.

03:35.925 --> 03:36.960
A little car trouble.

03:38.010 --> 03:41.047
The work you've done here at ASM
is very impressive, Spencer.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.753
Thank you.
We've got a great team.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.384
We're all about teamwork at IMG.

03:44.475 --> 03:47.342
We'd love to have you
to the campus so you can see firsthand.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.223
Thank you so much for showing
such interest in our company.

03:50.314 --> 03:51.429
Well, you're welcome.

03:51.524 --> 03:53.389
We have to do due diligence, of course,

03:53.484 --> 03:56.351
but like I said, everything we've seen
so far is impressive.

03:56.612 --> 03:59.945
We do have some questions regarding
ASM's valuation, though.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.904
You know what? Can ljust borrow
these guys for a second?

04:03.994 --> 04:05.029
Real quick, outside?

04:06.664 --> 04:07.744
Come on.

04:09.875 --> 04:10.910
What the fuck?

04:11.001 --> 04:13.959
Listen, before we go down that road
where we're okay with IMG,

04:14.046 --> 04:17.413
I want you to know I'm perfectly capable
of running Vegas and ASM.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.464
You can't even remember to wear a tie.

04:19.552 --> 04:21.088
How you gonna run two companies?

04:21.178 --> 04:23.590
Took an Ambien last night.
Had a bad night's sleep.

04:23.681 --> 04:24.761
That's why I couldn't wear a tie.

04:24.849 --> 04:26.305
Who gives a fuck?
You're not wearing a tie.

04:26.392 --> 04:27.928
I agree with Spencer here, okay?

04:28.018 --> 04:30.350
| used to take that shit.
That'll fuck you up.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.019
That stuff royally fucks you up.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.141
-Joe?
-Huh?

04:40.489 --> 04:43.606
Look,Spencen
I understand it would be great

04:43.701 --> 04:47.193
to have both ASM
and Vegas in your portfolio,

04:47.288 --> 04:48.653
but it's just not practical.

04:48.747 --> 04:49.873
Fuck practical!

04:50.207 --> 04:51.617
I never agreed to sell, Bret.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.574
You didn't have to.
I decided for us.

04:53.669 --> 04:57.537
Bret, the company's worth $15 million
at best against a $2 billion raise.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.371
-Come on.
-That's 15 million closer to the goal.

04:59.467 --> 05:02.925
And, by the way, it's a show of faith,
like me selling my yacht.

05:04.138 --> 05:09.098
Now, look, are you or are you not
with Joe and me on this?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.021
I agree with Mr. Anderson.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.096
So, what does that mean for Ricky?
For Vernon? Huh?

05:15.191 --> 05:16.897
That we just hand them over to IMG?

05:16.984 --> 05:18.520
-No, no, no, no.
-Give them up?

05:18.611 --> 05:21.728
We pay them back
and then we hand them over to IMG.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.689
-That's what this whole deal's about.
-Fuck. Fucking lMGl

05:24.783 --> 05:27.399
Come on! Theyjust swim along
with their mouths open

05:27.495 --> 05:29.827
like fucking whales
just eating everything in their path.

05:29.914 --> 05:32.747
Like plankton. We're fucking plankton.
ASM is plankton.

05:32.833 --> 05:36.041
We're very, very green plankton.

05:36.629 --> 05:37.744
Now let's do this.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.000
Come on.

05:41.759 --> 05:42.794
Fine.

05:43.594 --> 05:44.629
(DOOR OPENS)

05:47.723 --> 05:50.055
Ricky Jerret can’t seem to get out
of his own way.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.601
Footage has surfaced
of an altercation at a neighbor’s house

05:53.854 --> 05:57.187
in which Jerret appears
to assault a teenage boy.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.141
And by assault,
/ mean he punched the kid in the face.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.521
Baby, what in the world

06:01.612 --> 06:04.445
could possibly be going on
in Uncle Ricky's head?

06:04.532 --> 06:05.897
...l’d make a million bucks.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.733
Things could get ugly for the Patriots’
mercurial wide receiver

06:08.827 --> 06:10.033
-who has yet to sign
-(CELLPHONE RINGING)

06:10.120 --> 06:12.031
his new deal with New England.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.623
-Hello?
-Big C, what's happening?

06:16.835 --> 06:18.666
Watching Ricky on "SportsCenter."

06:19.004 --> 06:21.495
So much worse seeing it
than hearing about it.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.376
Yeah, talk to Ray Rice about that.

06:23.926 --> 06:24.961
How's the fam?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.462
My baby girl is perfect.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.673
Julie's good. What's up?

06:28.764 --> 06:30.550
About that email that you sent out,

06:30.849 --> 06:34.307
how'd you like to go on a meeting
for the GM position with the Chargers?

06:34.395 --> 06:36.761
-You serious?
-Yeah, man, I already talked you up.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.892
They were very impressed
with your Sutton signing down in Miami,

06:39.984 --> 06:43.101
so I convinced them to move your resume
up to the top of the pile.

06:45.614 --> 06:49.277
-Wow, I mean, I don't know what to say.
-Don’t mention it.

06:49.368 --> 06:52.110
Just give my clients some good deals
when you get the gig.

06:52.371 --> 06:55.078
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah. (LAUGHS)

06:55.332 --> 06:57.368
Yeah, that's the least
I could do, I guess.

06:57.459 --> 07:00.417
All right, I'm gonna connect you
with Spanos' guy in email later today.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.290
Hey, thank you, J.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.416
All right, buddy.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.835
I don't wanna talk about spin control.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.382
The real damage is I don't
have a fucking deal, gentlemen.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.467
Yeah, well, we're trying to
get the deal done, Rick,

07:16.562 --> 07:17.722
but you should've given me a heads-up

07:17.813 --> 07:20.395
before you knocked out
a 16-year-old white boy.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.681
All right, well, here's a heads-up, J.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.397
I'm gonna knock him out again
when I see him for leaking that shit.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.235
I don't think he leaked it, Rick.

07:27.323 --> 07:28.904
-Well, who did?
-I don't know.

07:28.991 --> 07:30.106
Doesn't fucking matter, by the way.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.612
The only thing that matters
is we get this deal done.

07:32.703 --> 07:33.909
Oh, really? We?

07:33.996 --> 07:35.702
Are you even a part
of this team any more?

07:36.165 --> 07:38.281
Last time I checked,
you was out in New York

07:38.375 --> 07:40.536
chasing paper for your damn self,
definitely not me.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.084
Yeah, lwas up there
trying to make a deal

07:42.171 --> 07:44.503
that will pay your money back
is what the fuck I was doing.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.421
Why don't you sell your damn suits,
man, get my money back?

07:46.508 --> 07:48.089
What the fuck you talking about?
God damn, man?

07:48.177 --> 07:49.633
Why don't you do your fucking job?

in suits looking stupid.

for fuck's sake!

07:56.977 --> 07:59.218
Look, ltalked to
New England this morning.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.473
We're in good shape.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.722
They just want you
to see a specialist, that's all.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.186
What kind of specialist?

08:05.277 --> 08:07.563
The kind that examines
what's going on inside of your mind,

08:07.863 --> 08:10.400
mentally, emotionally.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.734
A shrink?

08:12.951 --> 08:13.986
They think I'm crazy.

08:14.078 --> 08:16.615
Of course they think you're crazy.
You're playing dressed like a pimp.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.741
Why else
would they want you to see a shrink?

08:18.832 --> 08:22.416
Ricky, who cares if they think you're
a little off upstairs?

08:22.503 --> 08:24.744
You work for the NFL,
not the US. nuclear program.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.875
Besides, they'd rather you be
emotionally damaged than physically.

08:29.093 --> 08:30.128
Got it?

08:31.970 --> 08:33.756
Yeah, sure. Set it up.

08:34.056 --> 08:37.139
Good thing they didn't have smart phones
and cameras back when l was a player.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.682
I've been in a lot of messy situations.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.259
My shit would've been a lot messier
than that.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.890
Not messier than this.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.812
What are you mumbling?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.811
Look, I can mumble it,
slur it, speak it in Swahili.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.267
It's all the same thing, Spencer.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.193
The leaked tape, Vernon's suspension,

08:50.280 --> 08:51.406
I can track it all back to you

08:51.490 --> 08:53.481
and this bullshit that
you got with the league over Vegas.

08:53.575 --> 08:54.655
We don't know that.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.733
As a matter of fact,
I think it's the kid this time.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.905
You just said it wasn't.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.952
Because I didn't want him
to go back for round two.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.281
You're not gonna play me
like you play your clients.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.701
I'll admit it, I've been sniffing
in tall weeds with a short snout, okay?

09:05.796 --> 09:06.876
No, not okay.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.374
What does that even mean?

09:08.465 --> 09:11.923
It means that, yes, the league, in fact,
does hate my fucking guts, okay,

09:12.010 --> 09:13.546
but it doesn't mean
they're behind the Ricky leak.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.423
So then you gotta fucking figure it out.

09:15.514 --> 09:19.052
You are in player management,
not real estate development.

09:19.143 --> 09:21.976
What are you saying,
that l bounce on a $2 billion deal

09:22.062 --> 09:23.802
because the league is trying
shake down my clients?

09:23.897 --> 09:27.230
No, our clients. And, no,
just manage the situation better.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.308
This is what I do, I represent players.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.987
I don't build stadiums.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.187
And I'm sure as shit not taking
a grenade for you on this one.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.863
God damn, J, take it easy, all right?

09:34.950 --> 09:36.360
I had a bad fucking night's sleep.

09:36.452 --> 09:38.488
Well, then take
a fucking Ambien next time.

09:38.871 --> 09:40.077
—I did.
-(ENG|NE STARTS)

09:47.963 --> 09:49.544
Oh! You see that shit?

09:49.631 --> 09:52.839
I'm like Tom Cruise
in The Color of Money, hyah.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.338
You're more like Rodney Dangerfield
in Easy Money.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.181
Oh, shit, I don't get no respect at all.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.300
No respect.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.973
Vern is out 3.5 for the suspension.

10:02.144 --> 10:05.102
And on top of that, another 2.5
that Spencer already owes him.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.930
Needless to say,
his bank account is hurt as fuck.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.436
I know all about
hurt-as-fuck bank accounts.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.392
Mine has shed a few tears
over the years itself.

10:12.488 --> 10:13.853
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.562
Sometimes the tip is enough.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.784
Man, stop making dumb
fucking sexjokes, man.

10:17.868 --> 10:18.903
That wasn't a sexjoke.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.781
l was merely stating that
I understand the situation.

10:21.872 --> 10:22.907
Oh.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.033
How can I help?

10:24.917 --> 10:26.703
Well, that's just the thing.

10:27.002 --> 10:30.244
I mean, you've been helping,
but that shit ain't good enough.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.333
Joe Krutel is not ASM.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.835
No, no, technically he's not,

10:34.927 --> 10:37.168
but he's the most active part of ASM.

10:37.513 --> 10:41.882
Exactly. Spencer is M.I.A.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.425
Vernon's breathing
in a brown paper bag and shit.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.805
Y'all need to do something.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.933
What can I do besides
rubbing Vern down with CBD oil?

10:49.775 --> 10:51.982
You can start by calling
the league office.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.235
I might know somebody
that knows somebody.

10:56.907 --> 10:57.942
Doctor.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.566
-You can do it.
-How you doing, big guy?

11:00.661 --> 11:02.322
-Hey.
-If the vegetable dumplings

11:02.412 --> 11:03.822
are still hot, I'll take some.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.496
Oh, I can't give it to you.
It's a special delivery.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.789
How are you othenNise?

11:07.876 --> 11:09.537
-What are you in for?
-Meniscus.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.576
It's nothing. Tore mine three times.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.370
You'll be back on the tennis court
before you know it.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.547
I only wanna get some good drugs.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.840
That's my hot doctor.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.636
That is my hot wife.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.137
You and her?

11:27.521 --> 11:28.636
-Good luck.
-Hey!

11:28.730 --> 11:29.890
Paging Dr. Greane.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.017
What are you doing here?

11:31.108 --> 11:32.143
Where's Kiki?

11:32.234 --> 11:34.441
Everything's good.
And I brought you some Hung Phat.

11:34.528 --> 11:35.984
Whole left side of the menu,
just like you like.

11:36.071 --> 11:38.403
That's thoughtful.
You must want something really damn bad.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.526
Why I gotta want something
to come have lunch with my babe?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.778
Because I have five
knee surgeries lined up.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.861
It's all right. Put them to sleep.
Let them wait.

11:45.163 --> 11:48.030
Besides, I got a phone call that
I wanna talk to you about.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.160
I knew it was something.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.707
It's a just small thing.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.456
I thought you didn't wanna talk to me
about your business, Charles.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.289
Damn, can we just
forget about that for a little while?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.168
-Right now, all I wanna...

12:02.139 --> 12:03.174
Hello?

12:04.016 --> 12:06.007
I can't wait till she cuts on me.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.888
You're strange. You know that, right?

12:08.979 --> 12:10.219
-Me?
-Bizarre.

12:10.856 --> 12:11.891
Okay.

12:12.024 --> 12:13.139
Watch out for him.

12:15.027 --> 12:17.393
All right, sorry about that.
Now tell me about this call.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.102
I got an interview with the Chargers.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.449
-Open GM spot.
-That's amazing!

12:21.533 --> 12:22.648
-Right?
-Yes!

12:23.994 --> 12:25.029
So, are you cool?

12:25.120 --> 12:26.576
l'll spend half the year
in LA if I get it.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.699
Yeah, I mean,
no different than being in Tampa.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.788
This is the left coast. It's far away.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.992
Be closer to my family.
Look, either way, we'll make it work.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.121
We always have.

12:34.630 --> 12:35.745
Hey, so what'd Ricky want?

12:35.839 --> 12:36.874
Ricky who?

12:37.341 --> 12:38.751
Ricky, Ricky. Hejust called you.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.257
That. No, I can't talk about that.

12:40.344 --> 12:43.131
But thank you for the lunch. Love you.
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.095

12:53.440 --> 12:55.396

to spread around,

because I could sure use 'em today.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.853
When have I ever not been
a ray of sunshine for you, Strasmore?

13:00.948 --> 13:04.691
The Assembly's meeting Tuesday to vote
on the tax allocation for the stadium.

13:04.868 --> 13:08.360
My guys inside say we're
looking pretty damn good.

Hey, Nick.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.406
Yeah, well, pretty damn good

13:12.501 --> 13:14.742
Plus, we need the governor to pass it.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.455
What's with all the doom and gloom?

13:16.672 --> 13:17.912
You sell that company yet?

Psst!

13:35.399 --> 13:36.479
Got something for you.

Now's not a good time to
come out of the closet, Joe.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.188
Ta-da!

13:41.446 --> 13:42.822
Hola, Spencer.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.563
Maximo.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.944
Mr. Gomez has been kind enough

13:47.035 --> 13:49.276
to provide a little slide show
for our viewing pleasure.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.453
All right, well, this should be good.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.619
You followed around a 16-year-old boy?

13:54.918 --> 13:56.749
Recon has no age, Spencer.

13:56.837 --> 14:00.125
You wouldn't believe the shit
this guy's dug up, and fast, too.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.581
Listen, Joe, I don't give a shit
if the kid's on Accutane

14:02.676 --> 14:03.961
or who he's taking to the prom.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.553
He's taking her. Becky Harris.
She's a senior.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.846
Yeah, she's cute, too.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.719
Yeah, well, judging by their texts,

14:11.893 --> 14:13.884
she's got some big plans
for him on prom night.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.470
So, our boy's pulling girls
like this now, huh?

14:16.648 --> 14:18.730
That story must have spread
like wildfire.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.481
Like moths to the flame.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.525
Since the tape's release,
Jimmy Burns has become

14:22.612 --> 14:25.524
the most interesting man in the world.

14:25.824 --> 14:30.067
His lnstagram went
from 700 followers to 13K plus,

14:30.162 --> 14:31.823
and that was 12 hours ago.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.495
All right, well, what can we pin on him?

14:34.583 --> 14:36.119
There's some questionable calls,

14:36.209 --> 14:38.996
but you know,
there's no date rape, nothing like that.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.588
-Shit.
-All right, bye, Max.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.049
Whoa, whoa. There's something else.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.792
He's planning a press conference
on his Facebook page.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.553
If you want, I can send some guys,
work him over a little bit.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.845
No, I'll do it myself.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.098
Hmm.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.102
Hey, what am I supposed
to talk about, Doc?

15:02.360 --> 15:04.487
Well, we can talk about
whatever you like.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.732
Family is always a good place to start.

15:07.866 --> 15:08.981
Okay.

15:09.826 --> 15:13.068
All right, I'm close with my parents.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.405
My dad, Dennis,
was out of the picture for a long time,

15:16.500 --> 15:17.740
but he's back and he lives with me now.

15:17.918 --> 15:18.953
Mmm-hmm.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.909
| talk to my mom a couple times a week.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.214
She's a strong black woman.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.837
How is the relationship between them?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.794
Them two? There isn't.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.630
-No communication?
-Hell, no.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.005
And that's a good thing.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.054
Most of my early memories
were loud ones, you feel me?

15:33.141 --> 15:34.176
Yes, I do.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.804
Who do you feel you most take after?

15:37.729 --> 15:39.640
Uh, I'm a lot like both of them,

15:39.815 --> 15:40.850
that's a good and a bad thing.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.897
Look, Doc, we both know why I'm here.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.814
You drove to a wrong house
and punched a teenager in the face.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.817
-l'm not proud of it.
-I don't suspect you are,

15:50.575 --> 15:52.190
but it's myjob to find out why.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.701
Got myself in a predicament
with a nice young lady...

15:58.792 --> 16:00.703
-Mmm-hmm.
-A lot like my dad did with my mom.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.910
She told me she was gonna go home
to have the baby.

16:03.505 --> 16:04.745
And how'd that make you feel?

16:05.006 --> 16:06.041
Ashamed.

16:06.675 --> 16:07.915
Abandoned.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.129
Angry!

16:10.387 --> 16:11.968
A lot like my mom probably felt.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.341
Like I said,
I'm a lot like both of them.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.925
It's a pretty difficult
situation you're in.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.556
Hell, yeah, man.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.558
Had me all in my head, too.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.859
And how are you feeling othenNise?

16:26.153 --> 16:27.689
Honestly, I feel fantastic.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.815
I watched you in the Super Bowl.

16:29.906 --> 16:30.941
You saw the Super Bowl?

16:31.032 --> 16:32.863
-l was killing them?
-A hell of a comeback.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.283
-Yeah, it was, man.
-You took some big hits.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.576
Dished 'em out, too.

16:36.872 --> 16:38.863
You are a regular Hines Ward, my friend.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.658
I'm not gonna lie to you, Doc,
I'm an emotional guy.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.535
Sometimes I feel like
the sun is shining

16:45.630 --> 16:47.962
and all is right in the world.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.376
And other days...

16:50.051 --> 16:51.086
You know...

16:52.846 --> 16:54.461
I feel like there's a dark cloud,

16:56.057 --> 16:57.968
and I wanna kill somebody,
or even myself.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.352
It's like there's two different people.

17:04.441 --> 17:05.601
There's Ricky,

17:09.404 --> 17:10.439
and there's Jerret.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.424
Shit, like, what the hell is he doing,
in my kitchen?

17:37.515 --> 17:39.176
So I'm like, "All right, this is on."

17:39.267 --> 17:41.758
I'm sure you could've done
some damage on his ass, right?

17:41.853 --> 17:43.718
Like a rear naked choke
or something like that.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.223
Hey, yeah.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.271
All right, show's over. We gotta talk.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.270
Who's this ogre?

17:49.361 --> 17:50.396
Bro, he's a narc.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.693
He's not an ogre or a narc.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.650
He is Spencer Strasmore,
an old-time NFL player.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.777
Yeah, see, we've heard of each other.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.445
Let's take a walk, Jimmy.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.865
Excuse me, ladies. Be right back.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.410
You're probably here to talk
about your friend, Ricky.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.366
-He's also my client.
-A client?

18:06.628 --> 18:08.289
You're not serious.
What could you possibly do?

18:08.380 --> 18:09.540
I'm his financial manager.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.337
And you
releasing that tape was fucked up.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.459
I didn't release it.

18:12.717 --> 18:16.130
I don't know who did or how they got it,
but honestly, dude, I'm not mad at it.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.544
-Hi, Jimmy.
-Hey, Jimmy.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.129
Hey, how's it going, babes?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.722
Ooh, how could I be mad at that?

18:21.810 --> 18:24.722
Ah, I see, so you sell
Ricky down the riverjust for attention?

18:25.105 --> 18:28.222
Ricky Jerret's not my friend, okay?
He probably doesn't even know my name.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.396
Yeah, he's my friend.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.770
That punch made me famous
and I'm capitalizing on it.

18:31.861 --> 18:35.024
There's more to life, man,
than just attention and getting laid.

Name one thing.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.690
-lntegrity.
-Over pussy?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.025
Dude, I know you don't believe that.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.906
-How about your health?
-l'm 16.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.407
My health is fine.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.322
You want it to stay that way,

18:45.625 --> 18:47.707
then I advise you to shut the fuck up.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.413
Don't threaten me, Strasmore.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.540
I can take a punch,
or you haven't seen the video.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.417
I didn't mean for it to
came across that way, okay.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.715
It's not a threat, Jimmy.
I've had a long night.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.837
You look tired.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.044
I am tired, Jimmy. Jesus Christ.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.845
All right, listen, enough about me.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.427
Ricky made you a star, all right?

19:03.518 --> 19:06.305
I need you to show some decency
and not do this Facebook live thing.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.806
I canceled the Facebook thing.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.182
You did?

19:09.274 --> 19:12.607
Yeah. TMZ offered me, like,
10 grand to talk instead.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.150
I said I'd think about it.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.319
Are you gonna tell me
there's more to life than money now,

19:16.406 --> 19:17.862
"Mr. Financial Manager"?

19:17.949 --> 19:21.282
Let me ask, what it's gonna take
to let this thing die?

19:23.079 --> 19:25.286
-There goes my babies.

19:44.601 --> 19:45.636
Maybe.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.594
Well, instead of beating around the bush
and blowing out her eardrums,

19:48.688 --> 19:50.064
why don't you spit it out?

19:50.148 --> 19:51.388
Why is Ricky calling you?

19:51.941 --> 19:53.101
I can't talk about that.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.228
Why not?

19:54.861 --> 19:56.943
I'm not discussing
my business with you, Charles.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.192
I can talk about my business with you,
but you can't share?

20:00.450 --> 20:02.361
-That's right.
-That's a double standard.

20:02.619 --> 20:05.281
The difference is, is I don't need
your advice for my business.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.113
Hmm. That's messed up.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.286
It is, but it's true.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.963
But if you respect my profession,
you will not ask Ricky why he called me.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.305
Get it! Oh, oh.

20:28.061 --> 20:31.303
You did it, you did it,
you did it, you did it.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.148
What's up, Rick?

20:41.282 --> 20:43.534
I hope you're here 'cause you got
news from New England.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.610
No, Jason's on that,
but ljust got back from seeing the kid.

20:46.704 --> 20:47.910
What did that little punk have to say?

20:47.997 --> 20:50.283
He said that he's gonna forget
the whole thing

20:50.375 --> 20:52.616
if you pick him up
from school in your Ferrari.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.543
(SCOFFS) What do I look like?
I drive for Lyft?

20:55.797 --> 20:57.958
He want me to slap a pink mustache
on the grill, too?

20:58.049 --> 21:00.961
Now, listen, I hear you, Rick,
but he wants to look cool, that's all.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.292
Well, shit, he ain't cool.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.670
I saw he's gonna sing
like a canary on TMZ today.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.470
Yeah, they offered him $10,000,

21:06.558 --> 21:10.050
but he told me he's not taking the money
as long as you pick him up.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.184
Well, unless you want me
to get arrested,

21:12.272 --> 21:13.853
I don't think that's a good idea.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.555
WOMAN: Come on! Get it!

21:15.775 --> 21:19.313
Look, he said he didn't release
the tape, Rick, and I believe him.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.155
Well, if he didn't, Who did?

21:25.118 --> 21:26.153
Idid.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.114
Inadvertently.

21:29.664 --> 21:30.779
The fuck are you talking about?

21:30.874 --> 21:33.331
I've been butting heads with the league
over this fucking Vegas deal,

21:33.418 --> 21:35.033
and they're using you as leverage.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.292
That's some serious fucked-up shit.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.673
I know it's fucked up,
and I apologize to you, man.

21:42.760 --> 21:43.920
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

21:44.137 --> 21:47.220
The fact that I loaned you five mil
that I haven't gotten back dollar one on

21:47.307 --> 21:50.344
or the fact that
you blowing up your entire client list

21:50.435 --> 21:52.050
chasing global domination?

21:52.479 --> 21:53.764
You have every right to be upset.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.095
What do you know
about me being upset?

21:55.190 --> 21:56.555
Every time I turn around,

21:56.649 --> 21:58.480
you at the core
of some problem I got, man!

21:58.568 --> 22:00.183
Let me make it right.
The kid goes to Dade Country...

22:00.278 --> 22:03.361
Don't insult me, man, acting like
you taking care of my business,

22:03.448 --> 22:05.404
'cause you're not,
you're only making it worse!

22:07.660 --> 22:08.695
So stay out of it.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.615
Stay the fuck out of my business.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.046
(SCREAMING)

22:23.218 --> 22:25.675
When you said,
"We'd like to come see you,"

22:26.346 --> 22:29.383
I was under the impression
you meant Spencer and yourself.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.013
No, just me and Reggie.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.008
But Spencer does say hello

22:33.102 --> 22:35.764
and he appreciates you
giving us the time here today.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.721
Well, what can I do for you, gentlemen?

22:38.983 --> 22:40.598
We wanna talk about Vernon Littelfield.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.985
Yes, we are here to discuss
Vernon Littelfield.

22:44.572 --> 22:45.948
I just said that.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.489
Yeah, just restating our purpose.

22:49.327 --> 22:52.114
I'll assume this has something to do
with his suspension.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.945
We're not here to talk
about his diet plan.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.326
Okay, I'll take it from here.
Thank you, Reg.

22:56.543 --> 23:01.162
Yeah, we just feel
like it's a little steep.

23:01.381 --> 23:04.464
-You know? I mean, four games. Wow!
-(LAUGHS)

23:04.551 --> 23:06.587
Could've been a lot worse, Mr. Krutel.

23:06.678 --> 23:10.170
Fortunately, I'm a fan of you
and your illustrious partner.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.380
(CHUCKLES)

23:11.474 --> 23:13.806
This is not about him
and his illustrious partner.

23:13.893 --> 23:17.852
This is about my friend and associate,
and he made a mistake.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.929
We all know the league policy
is gonna change,

23:20.024 --> 23:22.891
you know, soon enough with CBDs,
as is the whole world.

23:23.278 --> 23:26.145
We know it's not approved yet
and he shouldn't have done it,

23:26.322 --> 23:28.108
but we said we're sorry
and y'all should accept it.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.655
I mean, y'all are the NFL.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.575
People in this country
look to y'all to set the vibe.

23:32.996 --> 23:35.112
-The standard.
-That's right.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.124
And you look like a boss.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.245
Why not think like one

23:39.419 --> 23:41.535
and lead the charge
on behalf of the league?

23:41.629 --> 23:43.244
Ambitious as you are,
you're gonna end up

23:43.339 --> 23:44.670
running the league someday anyhow.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.459
Well said, Reginald.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.507
Well, if y'all give a brother
a chance to speak,

23:48.720 --> 23:50.676
-he can make something of himself.
-(CHUCKLES)

23:51.014 --> 23:52.220
I agree.

23:52.807 --> 23:53.842
You do?

23:54.392 --> 23:55.427
It was well said.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.016
Well, thank you.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.059
I don't mean to come off aggressive.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.512
I know you got a lot of responsibility,

24:01.608 --> 24:04.224
but we'd appreciate
any help you can offer us.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.488
You ever been in a Ferrari before?

24:15.788 --> 24:17.824
Uh, no, no, I haven't.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.538
Ever been with a black girl?

24:20.126 --> 24:22.788
Me? Uh, yeah, yeah.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.164
You fucking lying.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.167
Yeah.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.839
Does this thing really go 202?

24:29.677 --> 24:30.757
Let's find out.

24:30.845 --> 24:32.631
(REWING)

24:39.771 --> 24:41.261
Holy fucking tit-fuck, dude!

24:41.356 --> 24:42.892
Hold on to your balls, son.

24:45.777 --> 24:47.313
(CAR HONKS)

24:50.323 --> 24:52.063
You're a fucking maniac, Jerret!

24:52.241 --> 24:53.981
You and I gotta have a little talk.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.207
(JIMMY LAUGHING)

25:03.294 --> 25:04.875
RICKY: Yeah.

25:04.962 --> 25:07.089
JIMMY: Okay. Damn!

25:07.548 --> 25:10.164
-(ENGINE REWING)
-That's beautiful. That is beautiful.

25:10.259 --> 25:11.795
-You did good for your first time.
-Thank you.

25:11.886 --> 25:12.966
I kept my cool, though.

25:13.054 --> 25:16.296
But it's like I say, you know,
you've gotta be, like, tunnel vision.

25:16.391 --> 25:18.006
You drove it like you stole it.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.349
I'ma have me one of these one day.

25:20.687 --> 25:21.722
How old you say you were again?

25:21.813 --> 25:23.599
Sixteen. I just got my license.

25:23.898 --> 25:26.435
My dad still doesn't let me
behind the wheel, though.

25:26.734 --> 25:29.942
First, I wanna apologize to you, man,
for punching you in the face.

25:30.655 --> 25:31.735
I mean, you a good-looking kid,

25:31.823 --> 25:34.360
and I could've done some serious damage,
so I'm glad I didn't.

25:34.951 --> 25:37.237
I just wanna say thank you
for picking me up at school.

25:37.328 --> 25:40.946
I know that's not really your thing,
but it was good vibage.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.035
Vibage, yeah.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.710
Can I share something with you?

25:44.794 --> 25:46.625
As long as it's not an STD, yeah.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.669
-Shit, you're funny.
-Thank you very much.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.917
I was voted "Best Sense of Humor"
in the yearbook.

25:51.008 --> 25:52.043
-Right.
-(CHUCKLES)

25:52.343 --> 25:54.174
What I'm gonna tell you is top secret.

25:54.262 --> 25:56.127
Not even New England knows, all right?

25:56.222 --> 25:57.257
Okay.

25:58.766 --> 25:59.801
(SIGHS)

26:00.101 --> 26:01.136
I'm not right in the head.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.388
I could've guessed that
when I found you in our fridge.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.514
I'm serious, Jimmy.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.733
I've taken a lot of hits
over the years, man,

26:07.817 --> 26:09.102
and I'm not fully healed.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.933
That's why I crashed your crib
all disoriented,

26:11.028 --> 26:12.279
and that's why I snapped.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.025
You're the only one who knows it.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.898
So, what is it, like a concussion or...

26:20.580 --> 26:21.615
Something like that.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.456
Look, I'm not gonna talk to TMZ

26:29.547 --> 26:31.458
or do the press conference
or anything like that.

26:31.549 --> 26:34.165
I was just doing that shit to be cool,
but I'm no rat.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.710
See, now you actually are cool.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.011
I do kind of feel like a G,
not gonna lie.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.600
-Yeah.
-Hey, what time is it?

26:41.684 --> 26:43.424
I gotta get home
before my mom starts to worry.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.972
You said your dad won't let you drive?

26:47.231 --> 26:48.516
You can drive my shit.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.140
Are you serious?

26:50.234 --> 26:52.190
Tell 'em you drove Ricky Jerret's car.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.736
Now it's your turn to
hold on to your balls, son.

26:55.823 --> 26:57.688
-Let's go. Let's see what you got.
-Let's do this.

26:58.075 --> 26:59.281
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

27:01.120 --> 27:02.155
What's going on?

27:02.246 --> 27:03.952
Joe is downloading his day to me.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.372
Why he thinks I might be
remotely interested,

27:06.459 --> 27:08.495
I haven't quite figured out yet.

27:09.670 --> 27:10.830
(LAUGHING) Okay.

27:11.631 --> 27:14.714
I was just telling Mr. Anderson
that I brought Reggie

27:14.801 --> 27:16.462
to see Candace
at the league Office today.

27:16.552 --> 27:17.962
Oh, Okay. And?

27:18.471 --> 27:20.587
And his impassioned plea

27:20.681 --> 27:23.764
resulted in a two-game
rollback Of the suspension.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.346
Wow, good jOb, Reggie.

27:26.687 --> 27:29.975
Well, clearly,
he's more effective than me.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.606
I was very proud of him.

27:32.944 --> 27:34.525
-Is there a point?
-Yeah.

27:34.695 --> 27:35.980
After a day like today,

27:37.031 --> 27:39.864
ljust felt inspired, you know?

27:39.951 --> 27:43.318
I've never felt this alive
except for when my wife died.

27:43.412 --> 27:46.199
I love being on the front lines
with the clients, you know,

27:46.290 --> 27:48.872
taking shrapnel, tossing grenades.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.747
I just don't think
anything compares to this.

27:51.838 --> 27:56.332
That's why I'm having
second thoughts, Mr. Anderson.

27:56.425 --> 27:59.007
I got to agree with Spence, here.

27:59.554 --> 28:00.964
I don't think we should sell ASM.

28:01.055 --> 28:02.886
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:02.974 --> 28:04.430
(LAUGHS)

28:04.517 --> 28:05.597
This is a joke, right?

28:05.685 --> 28:07.095
-That's nO joke.
-It's a joke.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.266
-It's not a joke.
-It's a joke.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.060
-It's nO joke!
-Joe, nO one cares

28:10.147 --> 28:12.729
about your first thoughts,
much less your second ones.

28:12.817 --> 28:15.103
What is going on with you guys?

28:16.612 --> 28:18.273
I'm having second thoughts, tOO.

28:19.407 --> 28:21.068
Our clients are gonna
be fine without us, Joe.

28:21.325 --> 28:24.613
If we've done ourjobs, then they've
learned to look after themselves.

28:26.706 --> 28:27.741
SO,

28:28.833 --> 28:29.868
I'm out.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.036
We're selling ASM.

28:43.222 --> 28:43.847
(MAKE IT BY PYREX PLAYING)

28:43.931 --> 28:47.423
I just wanna go home

28:47.852 --> 28:51.436
I been here too long

28:52.607 --> 28:56.646
I just wanna see my home

’Cause all my friends are gone
