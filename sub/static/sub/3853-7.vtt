WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.943
[narrator]
previously on dark matter.

00:01.944 --> 00:03.886
We all woke up
just like you,

00:03.887 --> 00:05.829
No idea who we are
or how we got here.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.772
You said someone was responsible
for wiping our memories.

00:07.775 --> 00:10.275
[five] no, not me,
it was someone else.

00:10.277 --> 00:13.178
It's like i'm
remembering it for them.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.515
I might be able to adapt some
of the medical equipment

00:16.517 --> 00:18.350
To work as a
kind of mind probe.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.152
And who's mind
would we be probing?

00:20.154 --> 00:22.321
Mine.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.489
So, who the hell is
ms. Maplethorpe, anyway?

00:24.492 --> 00:27.259
She was a teacher
i had when i was a kid.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.228
It's as good
a code as any.

00:37.271 --> 00:42.641
[one] who the hell is
ms. Maplethorpe, anyway?

00:42.643 --> 00:45.344
Who the hell is
ms. Maplethorpe, anyway?

00:45.346 --> 00:46.779
[six] it's as good
a code as any.

00:46.781 --> 00:49.148
I know i'll
never forget it.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.255
I know it!

00:56.257 --> 00:57.423
I know the code!

00:58.225 --> 00:59.491
I know the code!

00:59.493 --> 01:00.759
It's maplethorpe.

01:03.731 --> 01:04.763
[knocking]

01:04.765 --> 01:05.764
It's open.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.302
I can come back.

01:10.304 --> 01:13.772
No, it's okay.

01:13.774 --> 01:14.640
Uhh..

01:14.642 --> 01:16.141
What do you want?

01:16.143 --> 01:18.077
Uhh, status report.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.812
What's your status?

01:19.814 --> 01:23.849
Um, i'm fine, thanks but
i was talking about the ship.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.484
What about it?

01:25.486 --> 01:28.153
Well umm, apparently all
systems are operating

01:28.155 --> 01:29.688
Below optimal levels.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.457
The android's
on top of it.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.725
Also, our food stores
are down to four days

01:33.727 --> 01:36.328
And our water
levels have dropped.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.697
I do love
my long showers.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.867
Umm she's working on
shoring up the recycling system.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.870
I told her if it means
drinking other people's urine

01:44.872 --> 01:46.672
Than i'd rather die
of dehydration.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.440
You're fine with
drinking your own though?

01:48.442 --> 01:50.809
Gotta draw
the line somewhere.

01:50.811 --> 01:54.880
Look, the uhh, the bottom line
is she's doing the best she can,

01:54.882 --> 01:58.183
But this bucket needs more work
than one android can handle.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.751
Yeah...

01:59.753 --> 02:01.286
You can
turn around now.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.727
Anything else?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.595
Uhh yeah, we have a
damaged relationship.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.566
Do we?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.701
If it gets any worse we're
gonna have to shut it down.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.136
A damaged relationship?

02:17.138 --> 02:19.404
Relay switch. I
said relay switch.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.606
No, you didn't.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.807
I think you
heard me wrong.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.609
There's a relay switch
on the lower level--

02:23.611 --> 02:25.577
Look, the ship is
in a state of disrepair

02:25.579 --> 02:27.246
And we can't
afford to fix it.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.614
There's no news there.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.883
Why don't we just be
honest with each other?

02:30.885 --> 02:34.820
You're not here to
give me a status report.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.522
Why do you
think i'm here?

02:36.524 --> 02:38.824
To get a status report.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.859
What makes
you say that?

02:42.930 --> 02:45.931
Alright yes, you and three
have been acting

02:45.933 --> 02:49.234
Pretty distant toward
each other lately.

02:49.236 --> 02:52.471
And if you want my opinion,
you can do better than him.

02:52.473 --> 02:56.241
He has at least one
redeeming quality.

02:56.243 --> 02:59.745
I think it's just easy for you
not to get emotionally attached.

02:59.747 --> 03:00.879
What makes
you say that?

03:00.881 --> 03:02.347
Because i can't
imagine anyone

03:02.349 --> 03:03.615
Getting emotionally
attached to him.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.884
Oh you think i couldn't
help myself with you

03:05.886 --> 03:07.886
Because you're so
hopelessly irresistible?

03:07.888 --> 03:09.188
I didn't i'm not i--

03:09.190 --> 03:13.959
Well status is,
it's over.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.361
You and three?

03:16.363 --> 03:17.930
What happened?

03:17.932 --> 03:20.966
He didn't like all the names
i was calling him during sex.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.701
Is that what
this is about?

03:22.703 --> 03:23.769
What?

03:23.771 --> 03:26.605
You flirting with me?

03:26.607 --> 03:28.840
For your information,
if i was flirting with you,

03:28.842 --> 03:33.812
I would be taking my clothes
off, not putting them on.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.417
What are you doing?

03:38.419 --> 03:39.851
What, i thought--

03:39.853 --> 03:41.386
You thought wrong.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.354
But if--?

03:42.356 --> 03:44.489
No, it's complicated.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.726
Right.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.862
And also that.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.864
Don't stop
on my account.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.466
Did you
need anything?

03:54.468 --> 03:57.336
Five figured out the
code to the mystery room.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.487
You're kidding.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.637
And we're
about to open it

03:59.640 --> 04:01.707
But if you two have
something better to do.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.841
No.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.726
[keyboard tapping]

04:21.028 --> 04:25.597
[hydraullics moving]

04:26.900 --> 04:28.700
That's it?

04:28.702 --> 04:31.937
I think that's as open
as they're gonna get.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.306
[six] why is everything on
this ship so much work?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.243
[two]
clear.

04:54.244 --> 04:55.694
The panel appears
to be malfunctioning.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.862
Of course it is.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.297
Give me a moment.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.304
[bang]

05:06.740 --> 05:08.807
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

05:08.809 --> 05:10.309
Whoa-ho-ho!

05:12.746 --> 05:15.047
Hah, alright!

05:15.683 --> 05:17.916
I'm gonna
call you racquel.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.053
All these are locked.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.721
Ah, just
stand aside.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.022
See if i
can't fix that.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.324
Don't be stupid.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.825
We don't know
what's in there.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.760
It could be packed
with explosives.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.530
You know, anyone else wondering
why you need to lock a box

05:31.532 --> 05:33.332
That's inside
a locked room.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.100
Could be
something we stole

05:35.101 --> 05:36.867
That we just haven't gotten
around to opening yet.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.370
Hey, anybody
know what this is?

05:38.372 --> 05:39.638
[all]
whoa, whoa!

05:39.640 --> 05:41.774
What?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.909
I suggest you be
careful not to activate it.

05:43.911 --> 05:44.743
Oh.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.481
[chuckling]

05:49.483 --> 05:52.551
Well i
know what this is.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.886
We're rich!

05:54.888 --> 05:56.421
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

05:57.891 --> 06:00.359
Uh, guys.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.538
She's alive.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.975
The pod's hooked up to the ships
power but there's no data link.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.710
That would explain
why this chamber

06:18.712 --> 06:20.779
Never showed up on
any of our system scans.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.581
But what is
she doing in here?

06:22.583 --> 06:24.082
You think she's
got her memories?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.751
Let's thaw her,
find out.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.619
Are we sure
we want to do that?

06:27.621 --> 06:30.889
She's obviously in
here for a reason.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.992
Any dreams or visions
that would explain it?

06:33.994 --> 06:35.327
No.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.661
Let's thaw
her and find out.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.430
I said that like
five seconds ago.

06:38.432 --> 06:42.768
Yeah, but coming from her,
it actually sounds reasonable.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.737
[power buzzing]

06:45.739 --> 06:46.772
You're welcome.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.910
[scanner humming]

06:51.912 --> 06:53.412
How come
she's not waking up?

06:53.414 --> 06:55.614
She'd been in
stasis for a long time.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.682
I have her sedated
until i can fully evaluate

06:57.684 --> 06:58.817
Her physical condition.

06:58.819 --> 06:59.918
And?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.020
She has
tataryn's disease.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.855
It's a disorder
common on planets

07:03.857 --> 07:06.191
Where they mine serillium,
a result of the run-off from

07:06.193 --> 07:08.794
Refineries leaching
into the water supply.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.829
In its advanced state,
it causes rapid decline

07:10.831 --> 07:13.031
In specific neurological
motor function related

07:13.033 --> 07:14.900
To autonomic
life-support.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.169
There's
no known cure.

07:17.171 --> 07:18.870
Whoa, wait, so she's dying?

07:18.872 --> 07:21.156
Without question.

07:21.157 --> 07:23.441
It's probably why she was
in the pod in the first place

07:23.444 --> 07:25.744
To halt the progress
of the disease.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.480
If we keep her out,
how long does she have?

07:28.482 --> 07:30.148
It's impossible to say.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.651
It could be a matter of days.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.130
We've gotta put
her back in there.

07:34.131 --> 07:35.608
You're the one that wanted to
take her out in the first place.

07:35.609 --> 07:37.086
This is different,
we should put her back in.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.724
Hey, we need to find
out what she knows.

07:42.763 --> 07:47.599
[torch blowing]

07:47.601 --> 07:48.934
[lock clincks]

08:03.817 --> 08:05.050
Check it out.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.728
Maybe, it's the
android's sister.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.038
[two] a service bot?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.740
[one] entertainment model.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.877
Disassembled
but in good condition.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.111
Well proportioned.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.279
Whoa!

08:34.281 --> 08:35.647
I'll say.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.683
She's got a wide
range of capabilities.

08:38.685 --> 08:39.718
Magic tricks.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.754
Twirling.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.824
Contortion.

08:46.293 --> 08:49.694
[android] i'm preparing to wake
the woman we found in stasis.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.862
Okay.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.796
On my way.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.099
Go ahead.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.700
Bring the bot online.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.269
I'm sure she's got
a great personality

08:57.271 --> 08:58.670
To go with that body.

09:03.777 --> 09:07.312
[whooshing]

09:07.314 --> 09:11.550
It's amazing how the skin fuses
so you can't even see the seams.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.952
[five] it says her programming
is standard issue

09:13.954 --> 09:15.654
For an entertainment model.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.923
I don't think she's gonna
be much help with repairs

09:17.925 --> 09:19.090
Or anything like that.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.493
Well, she
can learn, can't she?

09:21.494 --> 09:23.895
And anyway there's lots
she can do in the meantime.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.330
Just turn her on.

09:27.868 --> 09:31.236
I mean, activate her.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.304
[beeping]

09:36.343 --> 09:38.577
Hello.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.178
My name is wendy.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.913
Would you like to
run a full demonstration

09:41.915 --> 09:43.214
Of my capabilities?

09:43.216 --> 09:46.117
Uh no, that's
alright, umm,

09:46.119 --> 09:48.687
We read the manual, wendy.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.456
Why does she talk like that?

09:51.457 --> 09:54.224
Umm, the factory default is set
to something called "aussie."

09:54.227 --> 09:55.126
Cool.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.230
What can i
do for you?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.832
I can sing you a song.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.902
I'm programmed in multiple
popular musical styles.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.204
Dubstep, tropical house,
classical.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.606
N-no thanks.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.174
That's umm, that's fine.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.709
Perhaps you'd like
to take advantage

10:10.711 --> 10:12.644
Of my advanced
culinary programming.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.646
We don't have
much to work with.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.947
Our rations
are kind of low.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.149
Not to worry.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.350
I'll extend the
rations by double

10:18.352 --> 10:23.221
And make them taste better
than you could ever imagine.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.290
Show me the kitchen.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.040
[android]
you were in stasis.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.908
Now you're safe
on board our ship.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.747
Who are you?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.749
You can
call me two.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.818
I was about to ask
you the same thing.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.787
My name is sarah.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.323
Do you remember
how you got here?

10:58.325 --> 11:00.191
Marcus!

11:07.000 --> 11:08.233
Thank god you're here.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.809
Uhh look, i don't know how
to tell you this but umm...

11:21.782 --> 11:23.265
What's wrong?

11:23.266 --> 11:24.749
We had an accident
with our stasis pods.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.885
In a way, you're lucky that
you weren't stored with us

11:26.887 --> 11:30.021
Because we all
lost our memories.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.925
None of us can remember anything
from before a couple weeks ago.

11:33.927 --> 11:34.993
Are you serious?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.932
You really
don't remember me?

11:41.201 --> 11:44.869
I'm sorry, believe me
i wish i did but i--

11:45.105 --> 11:47.772
Then why did
you revive me?

11:47.774 --> 11:50.875
We thought that maybe you
would have some answers for us.

11:53.046 --> 11:57.248
I don't
know you, or you.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.983
I've never seen
this ship before.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.920
The last thing i remember was
marcus putting me in stasis

12:01.922 --> 12:06.057
On my homeworld telling me
everything would be all right.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.130
This looks amazing.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.898
[six] i can get
used to this.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.383
Mmm.

12:15.384 --> 12:16.867
I've utilized less than two
percent of current rations

12:16.870 --> 12:19.003
For the creation
of this meal.

12:19.005 --> 12:21.840
Mmm, oh wow!

12:21.842 --> 12:23.441
This is even better
than i expected.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.843
Yeah.

12:26.012 --> 12:26.911
I'm glad.

12:26.913 --> 12:27.879
Mmm.

12:27.881 --> 12:31.015
You'll be happy to know
i've improved the efficiency

12:31.017 --> 12:34.319
Of the coolant systems
by eleven percent.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.187
Way to go.

12:36.189 --> 12:39.991
Wendy increased the taste of
our food by a hundred percent.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.760
[android]
i see.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.329
You should also know that if
i hadn't effected the repairs,

12:44.331 --> 12:47.432
The system would have
completely in a matter of days,

12:47.434 --> 12:49.033
Crippling the ship.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.101
Good catch.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.004
Wow.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.806
Mmm, wow!

12:57.944 --> 12:59.811
Shall i prepare
the next course?

13:02.215 --> 13:04.015
There's a next course?

13:04.017 --> 13:04.883
Hell yeah!

13:04.885 --> 13:06.951
[laughing]

13:08.088 --> 13:10.021
My god!

13:10.023 --> 13:11.122
Mmm.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.960
How much do you
know about "marcus"?

13:15.962 --> 13:22.000
I-i know what he--
what he was, what he is.

13:22.002 --> 13:25.370
It didn't--
it doesn't matter.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.039
On my world, anyone
who stood up

13:28.041 --> 13:30.575
To the corporations
was an outlaw.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.043
How did you meet?

13:34.548 --> 13:38.850
It was the end of
a terrible winter.

13:38.852 --> 13:42.086
I was out early one
morning gathering firewood.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.459
I found him lying in
the forest near my farm.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.597
At first, i thought
he was dead.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.303
I managed to get him back to
my house and dress his wounds.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.140
Later he told me later he
was a mercenary for hire.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.541
That he'd been
wounded on a mission,

14:03.543 --> 14:05.476
And the others he was
with left him behind.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.412
Did he say
who they were?

14:07.414 --> 14:09.080
No.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.950
And were you alone
when you found him?

14:11.952 --> 14:15.220
Yeah, i had been living on
my own for over a year after

14:15.222 --> 14:17.956
My husband died in the uprising.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.257
He was a miner.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.092
The uprising...?

14:21.094 --> 14:23.061
We knew people
were getting sick,

14:23.063 --> 14:26.164
But the ferrous doctors kept
told us everything was fine.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.499
Then people
started dying.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.035
That's when the
rebellion started.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.972
But we didn't
stand a chance.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.242
Did three ever umm--

14:38.345 --> 14:39.244
Marcus.

14:39.246 --> 14:44.048
Did marcus tell you what
he was doing on your planet?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.985
He'd said that he was
hired by a rival corporation

14:46.987 --> 14:49.487
To hijack a shipment
of serillium.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.090
The mission did
not go as planned.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.125
Several of his
crew were killed.

14:54.127 --> 14:58.096
And when he didn't make it
back to the rendezvous point...

14:58.098 --> 15:00.064
...They probably
assumed he was dead.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.634
So, you saved his life.

15:02.636 --> 15:07.138
And he saved mine.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.073
At least for a while.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.282
[grunting]

15:17.284 --> 15:23.087
[sword whipping]

15:23.089 --> 15:25.523
Hey, you missed
quite the meal.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.193
I don't eat
for pleasure.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.929
Right, anyway.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.530
I wanted to
introduce you to wendy.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.033
I'm pleased
to meet you.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.968
If there's anything
i can ever do for you,

15:36.970 --> 15:38.002
Please don't hesitate to ask.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.038
I don't require
entertainment.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.240
Well, you do
require a massage.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.708
Why do you say that?

15:46.112 --> 15:49.981
Your left shoulder sits two
millimeters below your right,

15:49.983 --> 15:51.215
Possibly indicating tension

15:51.217 --> 15:54.018
In your right
supraspinatus or lats.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.221
It could affect your
overall precision and technique.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.257
Well, it feels
fine to me.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.625
[laughs]

16:00.627 --> 16:02.026
Turn around.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.662
She's not gonna hurt you.

16:12.005 --> 16:15.974
[moans]

16:15.976 --> 16:17.275
Is that better?

16:17.277 --> 16:19.210
Umm.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.145
It feels the
same, no difference.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.046
Shall i stop?

16:22.048 --> 16:23.281
No.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.188
Easy tiger.

16:35.061 --> 16:35.627
Ahh!

16:35.628 --> 16:36.194
There you are.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.679
Don't start.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.163
Did you finish that
"thing" you needed to do?

16:39.165 --> 16:40.131
Don't start.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.699
Hey, you have
to talk to her.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.468
What am i supposed
to say, huh?

16:43.470 --> 16:45.737
I don't know but it's obvious
there's something between

16:45.739 --> 16:48.206
The two of you,
or at least there was.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.141
Yeah, but i
don't remember.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.143
So what's the point?

16:52.144 --> 16:54.144
Look, against all imaginable
odds it turns out that somebody

16:54.147 --> 16:56.347
In this galaxy doesn't
think you're a total jerk.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.549
She's alone in that room
and scared out of her mind.

16:58.551 --> 17:02.120
And apparently, you're the one
who brought her on this ship.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.355
What are you gonna
do about it?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.305
Uh, hi there.

17:22.742 --> 17:23.808
Hi.

17:26.346 --> 17:29.480
Uhh listen,
i'm sorry about before.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.182
I guess this whole
thing's just got me

17:31.184 --> 17:32.750
A little weirded
out that's all--

17:32.752 --> 17:35.586
Yeah, me too.

17:38.625 --> 17:42.827
You um, do you wanna go
for a walk or something?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.328
Yeah.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.365
Yeah, okay.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.167
I'd like that.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.601
Ok.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.803
Alright.

18:08.121 --> 18:08.820
[gasp]

18:08.822 --> 18:10.555
God!

18:10.557 --> 18:12.824
I-i didn't
realize you were there.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.526
What would you
like to do now?

18:15.528 --> 18:17.945
Uh...

18:17.946 --> 18:20.363
I'm programmed with various
recreational subroutines.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.133
Do you like fun?

18:22.135 --> 18:23.735
Uhh, i-i guess.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.336
What kind of fun
would you like to have?

18:25.338 --> 18:27.238
We could dance.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.239
Play a game.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.874
Umm, no thank you.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.742
Um, i was actually
about to lie down.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.778
Excellent.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.580
Would you like me to join?

18:35.582 --> 18:39.250
I'm adept at a wide variety of
contemporary erotic techniques:

18:39.252 --> 18:43.888
Quasaring, the infinite moebius,
dunking the cosmic donut--

18:43.890 --> 18:45.690
That's-- i really shouldn't.

18:45.692 --> 18:46.591
Umm, wait.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.593
What was
that last one?

18:48.595 --> 18:51.262
On the other hand,
if you prefer male anatomy

18:51.264 --> 18:52.730
I come with
interchangeable parts.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.798
No, no, no, no.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.800
I appreciate
the offer.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.303
But i umm,
it's just a little weird.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.838
What's weird about it?

19:00.840 --> 19:03.674
Sexuality is a natural
human function.

19:03.676 --> 19:07.912
Sure, but you're
an android.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.680
I mean, what do
you get out of it?

19:09.682 --> 19:11.883
I possess almost three
thousand touch receptors.

19:11.885 --> 19:16.187
I can experience pleasure.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.688
I sense anxiety.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.158
If you like, i can turn off
my performance analytics

19:20.160 --> 19:21.926
Before we begin.

19:21.928 --> 19:29.634
Look, i appreciate the offer, i
just don't think i'd feel right.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.701
Or--

19:33.806 --> 19:37.408
On the other hand, there's
only one way to find out.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.455
Really?

19:51.457 --> 19:53.791
She's not
complicated.

It's okay, you don't
have to apologize.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.829
I know the kind of
world you live in.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.399
Yeah but there's
no where to sit so--

21:47.607 --> 21:50.908
You have
to believe me.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.444
There was a time when
we were together--

21:54.914 --> 21:56.547
That you
were different.

going somewhere?

23:12.392 --> 23:14.725
This was a mistake.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.926
I don't think so.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.965
No.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.466
You know, sarah,
you don't know who i am.

23:22.468 --> 23:26.837
I'm not the guy who
stays, i'm the guy who leaves.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.806
You don't have to be.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.512
Sarah?

23:34.514 --> 23:36.064
That was
the first sign

23:36.065 --> 23:37.615
That there was
something wrong with me.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.582
Sarah!

23:38.584 --> 23:40.718
Look at me.

What's wrong?

23:42.488 --> 23:45.956
After that, i was
nothing but a burden.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.558
You could've
left at any time.

23:47.560 --> 23:51.028
But you didn't.

23:52.732 --> 23:53.864
You stayed.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.769
Maybe
i felt guilty.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.605
That might have kept
you for maybe a day or two.

not for months.

I don't believe there
was anything wrong

24:56.629 --> 24:59.697
With the way
it was before.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.899
You don't like
her much, do you?

25:03.002 --> 25:04.902
I don't have an
opinion either way.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.538
I just think there are more
relevant functions she could be

25:07.540 --> 25:10.774
Performing besides
cooking and playing games.

25:10.776 --> 25:14.278
Stress can cause
humans to act inefficient.

25:14.280 --> 25:18.516
Relieving stress can be a
lot like recharging batteries.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.117
Laughter is
the best medicine.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.586
Something like that.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.655
I'm not
programmed for humor.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.791
Well, just because people are
having a little fun with wendy

25:27.793 --> 25:30.961
Doesn't mean we don't
appreciate what you do.

25:30.963 --> 25:33.998
I mean, i don't think we
could get by without you.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.100
According to my
self-diagnostics,

25:36.102 --> 25:37.968
My performance is
satisfactory in every way

25:37.970 --> 25:39.904
That my
programming dictates.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.873
Now don't go getting
a big head or anything.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.209
My head is always
a consistent size.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.144
See, who says
you're not funny?

25:52.051 --> 25:58.856
Look, wendy is new here
and she's just trying to fit in.

25:58.858 --> 26:01.091
I know
what that feels like.

26:01.727 --> 26:06.764
I think if you gave her a
chance, you'd really like her.

26:20.913 --> 26:26.784
[whoosh]

26:32.758 --> 26:33.858
[keyboard clicking]

26:33.859 --> 26:34.959
What are you doing?

26:34.961 --> 26:36.627
I have tidied the room

26:36.628 --> 26:38.294
And am now attempting
to learn the ship's system.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.231
So i can
be more helpful.

26:41.233 --> 26:44.068
Is there anything
i can do for you?

26:46.606 --> 26:49.340
No, i'm good.

26:49.342 --> 26:53.677
I could tell you what
most pleases one sexually.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.615
What makes you think
i would wanna know that?

26:59.118 --> 27:02.953
Your body temperature rises .25
degrees when you're around him.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.156
Also, blood flow to your cheeks
increases also indicating--

27:06.158 --> 27:09.059
Okay,
that's enough.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.761
Where is
one, anyways?

27:10.763 --> 27:12.730
I think he's
in the mess hall.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.732
I made him
something special.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.989
What happened?

27:21.990 --> 27:23.740
I don't know,
she just collapsed.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.310
She's breathing but i can't
wake her, can you help her?

27:26.312 --> 27:28.312
No, i don't
know what to do.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.047
Where's the android?

27:30.049 --> 27:32.316
She went to the
bridge to run a diagnostic.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.283
Okay.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.655
Android, we need
you in the infirmary.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.256
I'm on my way.

27:41.694 --> 27:42.660
Hello.

27:42.662 --> 27:43.360
Hello.

27:46.999 --> 27:50.167
I'd like to inform you that your
presence no longer offends me.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.436
As a new member of this
ship's extended crew,

27:52.438 --> 27:57.708
It must be difficult to fit in,
especially in that outfit.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.710
And i've been
less than welcoming.

27:59.712 --> 28:02.146
I regret my actions
that i can only attribute

28:02.148 --> 28:04.081
To a flaw in
my programming.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.151
I misjudged you
and i'm sorry.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.991
[gunshots]

28:17.463 --> 28:19.029
Apology
not accepted.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.038
Mmm.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.174
Mmm.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.811
How's lunch?

28:33.813 --> 28:35.012
Fantastic.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.213
Even he's on board.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.717
Her soup
is umm, very good.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.086
[door closing]

28:44.123 --> 28:45.355
That's weird.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.863
[machine beeping]

28:52.865 --> 28:53.897
We're locked in.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.775
We just
dropped out of ftl.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.777
[two] android, this is two,
we got problem,

29:06.779 --> 29:09.113
One, four, six and i
are locked in the mess.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.514
Android,
do you read?

29:13.352 --> 29:14.485
[beeping]

29:15.788 --> 29:19.790
Crew of the raza,
this is cyrus king.

29:19.792 --> 29:22.126
I'm sure you're surprised
to be hearing my voice.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.861
You probably
thought i was dead.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.896
Maybe if we
remembered who you were.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.999
I arranged for you to acquire
this service android knowing

29:29.001 --> 29:33.403
That when you activated it,
i would finally get my revenge.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.838
[beeping]

29:34.839 --> 29:36.272
You killed
everyone in my unit.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.908
Burned
them all alive.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.109
Probably deserved it.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.045
Now you're going to
suffer the same fate.

29:42.047 --> 29:46.450
Your ship has been directed
to fly into the nearest star.

29:46.452 --> 29:49.219
[whoosh]

29:49.221 --> 29:51.488
Here's hoping your last
moments will be as tortured

29:51.490 --> 29:53.991
And painful as possible.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.126
Come with me.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.810
Three,
do you read me?

30:12.812 --> 30:14.211
Yeah, go ahead.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.180
Our android's offline
and we're trapped in the mess.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.182
Is five with you?

30:18.184 --> 30:19.939
Yeah.

30:19.940 --> 30:21.695
Good,
tell her to stay put.

30:21.696 --> 30:23.451
I need you to get to the port
side sub-level power relay.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.023
You can shut down the
engines from there.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.592
It'll buy us some time, slow
our progress toward the star,

30:28.594 --> 30:31.161
So we can figure
a way out of this.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.296
But you
don't know how--

30:32.298 --> 30:33.297
Shh.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.297
Do you
understand me?

30:34.567 --> 30:36.900
Yeah,
understand.

30:36.902 --> 30:37.935
Three out.

30:39.872 --> 30:40.871
Kill your comm.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.241
I-i don't get it.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.143
She knows you don't
know how to do that.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.178
Yeah, but
wendy doesn't know.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.013
She's monitoring comms.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.983
So you're the bait.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.018
Exactly.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.554
Once wendy leaves the bridge,
i need you to get in there and

30:57.556 --> 31:00.090
Find a way to work around
whatever it is she's done.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.959
I'll distract her.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.427
That's gonna
take some time.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.229
I'll give you
all i can, kid.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.430
Go.

31:14.106 --> 31:18.108
[door closes]

31:22.314 --> 31:23.380
Hey.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.117
What's going on?

31:27.119 --> 31:29.453
We're having a little technical
problems with the ship.

31:29.455 --> 31:32.189
It's gonna be okay,
we're gonna fix it.

31:32.191 --> 31:33.624
But your condition's
gotten worse

31:33.626 --> 31:35.492
So we're gonna put
you back in stasis.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.294
No, no,
no, no, not yet--

31:39.098 --> 31:41.064
I promise
i will not rest until

31:41.066 --> 31:43.400
I've done everything
i can to save you.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.469
Okay.

31:45.471 --> 31:48.005
Okay.

31:48.006 --> 31:50.540
I guess a little rest now and
then isn't such a bad thing.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.376
No.

32:01.553 --> 32:04.588
I wish
that i remembered.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.957
It's okay.

32:06.959 --> 32:14.498
We'll make
new memories.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.199
I'll see
you soon, okay?

32:19.505 --> 32:20.671
Yeah.

32:20.673 --> 32:22.205
Promise?

32:22.207 --> 32:22.940
I promise.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.174
Okay.

32:35.187 --> 32:41.391
[whoosh]

33:48.260 --> 33:49.426
[gunshot]

33:49.428 --> 33:51.261

33:51.263 --> 33:52.129
Whoa!

33:52.131 --> 33:53.263
[gunshot]

33:53.265 --> 33:54.798
This is three
do your thing.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.400
Do you
have her engaged?

33:56.402 --> 33:57.601
I guess
you could say that.

33:57.603 --> 34:00.637
[gunshots]

34:00.639 --> 34:02.172
Ugh!

34:02.174 --> 34:04.074
[boom]

34:05.277 --> 34:08.178
Good, can you
keep her busy?

34:08.180 --> 34:09.246
I can try.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.281
Damn it!

34:14.119 --> 34:15.719
Five,
where are you?

34:15.721 --> 34:18.522
I'm on the bridge, but i-i
can't access the nav system,

34:18.524 --> 34:20.190
She's locked me out.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.391
I'm trying to
find a work-around.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.060
We'll get to
that in a minute.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.829
For now, see if you can
access non-essential systems.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.631
Switch all
doors to manual.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.066
I'm on it.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.773
[grunting]

34:36.775 --> 34:38.108
[bang]

34:40.546 --> 34:41.845
I've got it!

34:41.847 --> 34:43.413
Good girl.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.254
You're with me.

34:53.792 --> 34:59.262
[grunting]

34:59.264 --> 35:01.665
Ah!

35:01.667 --> 35:06.536
[punching]

35:06.538 --> 35:10.173
[grunting]

35:10.175 --> 35:11.341
[crash]

35:18.784 --> 35:20.884
[grunting]

35:20.886 --> 35:22.352
Wait!

35:22.354 --> 35:24.387
This runs counter
to your programming!

35:24.389 --> 35:25.522
Fun, remember?!

35:25.524 --> 35:26.490
Fun?

35:26.492 --> 35:27.624
I don't
remember fun.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.909
No?

35:28.910 --> 35:30.193
I just remember
cooking and cleaning

35:30.195 --> 35:32.129
And dunking
the cosmic doughnut.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.698
Ahh, wait, what
was that last one?

35:36.168 --> 35:37.234
Doughnut.

35:37.236 --> 35:43.874
[groaning]

35:43.876 --> 35:47.911
I thought you were
designed to serve, not kill!

35:47.913 --> 35:49.880
I find your view
on female androids

35:49.882 --> 35:52.149
Both antiquated
and offensive.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.394
You okay?

36:08.800 --> 36:10.734
Never better,
why do you ask?

36:10.736 --> 36:12.702
Two,
this is six.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.404
We've taken
care of the robot.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.506
Yeah well, i wish that was
the worst of our problems.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.941
We're locked
out of navigation,

36:17.942 --> 36:19.375
And we're still headed
straight for the star.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.912
There's no way
to change course.

36:26.185 --> 36:29.653
She put an encrypted passcode on
the ship's main control systems.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.421
It could take
hours to solve it.

36:31.423 --> 36:32.656
[electrics sparking]

36:32.657 --> 36:33.890
We don't have
that kind of time.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.824
This is two.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.426
Is wendy's
head damaged?

36:36.428 --> 36:37.961
It's detached,
but it looks okay.

36:37.963 --> 36:40.263
Good, bring the head to
the bridge and be quick.

36:40.265 --> 36:41.898
In the meantime,
space her body.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.685
[electrics sparking]

37:13.599 --> 37:14.664
[power dying]

37:22.541 --> 37:25.575
The power is dying
all over the ship.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.510
How are we going to
find the code in all that?

37:27.512 --> 37:29.846
There's a log that's
recorded on a timeline.

37:29.848 --> 37:32.882
She has to have set the passcode
sometime within the last hour.

37:42.694 --> 37:45.462
Won't work on manual
we'll have to reset.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.496
All right.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.633
Whoa, woah,
woah, woah!

37:50.669 --> 37:54.738
We got a problem here,
wendy's body just came alive.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.340
We powered
the head.

37:56.341 --> 37:57.941
It must've activated
the body remotely.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.010
Ah,
it's no big deal.

38:00.012 --> 38:01.711
Robot can't see
without her head.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.580
Ah!

38:03.949 --> 38:06.616
Scratch that,
she can see us just fine!

38:08.920 --> 38:10.587
How
is that possible?

38:10.589 --> 38:12.255
It's the link!

38:12.256 --> 38:13.922
She's tied into the
ship's internal sensors.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.392
We gotta
pull the plug!

38:15.394 --> 38:16.059
Not yet.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.761
I don't have the code.

38:17.763 --> 38:20.563
Any time now
would be good!

38:26.471 --> 38:28.471
Got it, we've got
nav control!

38:30.876 --> 38:32.475
[sparking]

38:39.951 --> 38:41.017
Come on.

38:42.321 --> 38:43.486
You all right?

38:46.591 --> 38:48.958
[chuckling]

38:48.960 --> 38:50.627
I hate robots.

38:57.402 --> 39:00.704
How long do you think it'll take
for her to fully regenerate?

39:00.706 --> 39:03.340
Depends on how
extensive the damage is.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.476
We'll have
to wait and see.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.552
No, no.

39:41.613 --> 39:43.580
What happened?

39:46.918 --> 39:50.587
The pod must've been damaged
by the power fluctuations.

39:50.589 --> 39:52.689
Without stasis,
the disease ran it's course.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.630
It's my fault.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.099
It was my idea to
activate the robot.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.534
It was stupid.

40:12.911 --> 40:16.713
Did you program
that thing to attack us?

40:16.715 --> 40:19.015
No.

40:19.017 --> 40:22.919
Did you give sarah
an incurable disease?

40:22.921 --> 40:23.987
No.

40:26.691 --> 40:28.925
Then what are
we talking about?

40:39.671 --> 40:45.675
[whoosh]

41:25.517 --> 41:26.182
[knocking]

41:26.184 --> 41:27.250
Yeah?

41:28.653 --> 41:31.087
Hey is this a bad time
for a status update?

41:31.923 --> 41:33.156
Can't it wait?

41:34.893 --> 41:36.759
It's going to take
us some to sort through

41:36.761 --> 41:39.028
All the items we found
in the mystery room.

41:39.030 --> 41:42.532
Some are locked and
inaccessible for now but uhh,

41:42.534 --> 41:45.702
We've got enough funds to
effect full repairs, re-stock,

41:45.704 --> 41:48.605
And even have enough
leftover for a few luxury items.

41:49.107 --> 41:49.772
Great.

41:49.774 --> 41:55.011
Maybe another robot, one of
those entertainment models.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.746
A less
buggy version?

41:56.748 --> 41:57.881
No, thanks.

42:00.151 --> 42:04.020
Latent killer sub-program
aside, she was a damn good cook.

42:04.022 --> 42:07.223
And, i imagine, she
had other worthy skills.

42:07.225 --> 42:09.926
Look, i don't know
what i was thinking.

42:09.928 --> 42:11.928
I have
a pretty good idea.

42:11.930 --> 42:16.199
Well, as it turns
out, i was wrong.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.934
It was complicated.

42:27.145 --> 42:28.478
I've been thinking.

42:28.479 --> 42:29.812
Maybe, complicated
isn't such a bad thing.
