<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

<b>Vast riches... Hidden treasures...</b>

00:14.570 --> 00:18.330
<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.040 --> 00:23.150
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.150 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.490 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.220 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:55.880 --> 01:57.050
<b>Gon-kun!</b>

01:57.050 --> 01:58.300
<b>Where is everyone?</b>

01:59.050 --> 02:02.010
<b>You need more rest, Gon-kun...</b>

02:06.640 --> 02:11.650
<b>Some x Brother x Trouble</b>

02:14.710 --> 02:17.650
<b>After Gon learned why Killua 
had been disqualified,</b>

02:18.140 --> 02:21.660
<b>he was furious with Gittarackur...</b>

02:21.660 --> 02:24.510
<b>Rather, Killua's brother, Illumi.</b>

02:47.170 --> 02:48.810
<b>Apologize to Killua!</b>

02:53.150 --> 02:55.550
<b>Apologize? For what?</b>

02:56.330 --> 02:58.310
<b>You don't know what you did wrong?</b>

02:58.310 --> 02:59.450
<b>Nope.</b>

03:01.850 --> 03:04.370
<b>You don't have the right to be his brother.</b>

03:05.920 --> 03:08.700
<b>Must I earn the right to be his brother?</b>

03:19.640 --> 03:22.710
<b>He doesn't need to earn the 
right to be my friend!</b>

03:30.840 --> 03:32.350
<b><i>This boy is...</i></b>

03:35.390 --> 03:37.370
<b>Don't bother apologizing.</b>

03:37.370 --> 03:39.860
<b>Just take me to see Killua.</b>

03:40.350 --> 03:41.810
<b>What will you do then?</b>

03:42.320 --> 03:43.460
<b>That should be obvious...</b>

03:44.450 --> 03:46.060
<b>I'm gonna rescue Killua!</b>

03:47.270 --> 03:50.990
<b>You make it sound as 
though I kidnapped him...</b>

03:51.620 --> 03:55.200
<b>He walked away on his own.</b>

03:55.980 --> 03:58.270
<b>But it wasn't by choice.</b>

03:58.710 --> 04:01.010
<b>He was being manipulated by you people.</b>

04:01.010 --> 04:02.990
<b>It's the same thing as kidnapping him!</b>

04:12.540 --> 04:16.520
<b>We happened to be discussing 
this very subject, Gon.</b>

04:16.890 --> 04:21.030
<b>Kurapika and Leorio have both 
lodged complaints.</b>

04:21.470 --> 04:24.090
<b>The committee has been discussing</b>

04:24.090 --> 04:25.870
<b>the fairness of Killua's disqualification.</b>

04:25.870 --> 04:27.290
<b>Killua had been behaving</b>

04:27.290 --> 04:30.420
<b>in a strange manner during and 
since his battle with the man</b>

04:30.420 --> 04:32.040
<b>who called himself Gittarackur!</b>

04:32.290 --> 04:38.040
<b>I believe that he was hypnotized 
into committing murder.</b>

04:38.830 --> 04:39.880
<b>Under normal circumstances,</b>

04:39.880 --> 04:43.800
<b>it would be impossible to use 
hypnosis to induce a person to kill.</b>

04:43.800 --> 04:47.240
<b>However, as Killua was raised 
in a family of assassins,</b>

04:47.240 --> 04:49.170
<b>murder was a part of his daily life,</b>

04:49.170 --> 04:52.310
<b>so it's natural that he would lack 
the ethical restraint of most!</b>

04:53.250 --> 04:54.790
<b>I want to mention</b>

04:54.790 --> 04:58.060
<b>that the attack happened during the 
match between Bodoro and me.</b>

04:58.840 --> 05:03.180
<b>It's possible that he was trying to help me.</b>

05:04.220 --> 05:07.530
<b>Given that, the one who should be disqualified</b>

05:08.170 --> 05:09.780
<b>is me.</b>

05:10.380 --> 05:11.850
<b>In any case,</b>

05:11.850 --> 05:15.790
<b>Killua was not in control of his own actions.</b>

05:16.320 --> 05:19.040
<b>Thus, he should not have been disqualified!</b>

05:20.110 --> 05:22.930
<b>That is mere speculation.</b>

05:22.930 --> 05:24.800
<b>There is no proof.</b>

05:25.500 --> 05:30.280
<b>There were no clear signs of manipulation.</b>

05:30.280 --> 05:32.310
<b>In fact, I would question</b>

05:32.310 --> 05:36.060
<b>the claim that he was hypnotized.</b>

05:36.640 --> 05:39.400
<b>I agree that the incident occurred after</b>

05:39.400 --> 05:43.190
<b>the battle between Leorio 
and Bodoro had begun.</b>

05:43.520 --> 05:47.980
<b>At that point, both fighters 
were evenly matched.</b>

05:47.980 --> 05:51.280
<b>Bodoro had more experience.</b>

05:51.280 --> 05:56.960
<b>But in terms of raw combat ability, 
Leorio was the stronger.</b>

05:57.620 --> 06:01.890
<b>There was no need for Killua to interfere.</b>

06:02.960 --> 06:05.560
<b>There was some other funny 
business happening.</b>

06:06.980 --> 06:09.840
<b>Like when you fought Hisoka.</b>

06:10.570 --> 06:11.470
<b>Back then,</b>

06:12.630 --> 06:14.470
<b>what did he say to you?</b>

06:15.510 --> 06:17.480
<b>Neither of you seemed particularly tired.</b>

06:18.560 --> 06:20.930
<b>But Hisoka whispered something in your ear,</b>

06:20.930 --> 06:22.230
<b>right before conceding.</b>

06:23.910 --> 06:25.230
<b>That's pretty strange.</b>

06:25.640 --> 06:28.930
<b>I'd understand surrendering after your 
opponent whispers something to you,</b>

06:28.930 --> 06:31.700
<b>as happened with Hanzo and me, 
or Bodoro and Hisoka.</b>

06:32.100 --> 06:34.740
<b>Because we were under 
considerable pressure.</b>

06:35.660 --> 06:37.560
<b>But in your case, the exact opposite happened.</b>

06:37.910 --> 06:41.520
<b>I have to wonder if you struck 
some sort of bargain.</b>

06:42.840 --> 06:46.210
<b>If you're going to question 
anything that seems odd,</b>

06:46.210 --> 06:49.010
<b>your own victory was quite odd, indeed.</b>

06:50.040 --> 06:54.010
<b>If you have nothing to hide, 
you should tell us what he said.</b>

06:54.610 --> 06:56.270
<b>Right now.</b>

06:56.790 --> 06:58.660
<b>I have no obligation to tell you.</b>

06:59.930 --> 07:02.610
<b>Maybe not, but I believe you owe it to us.</b>

07:03.390 --> 07:04.220
<b>Not really.</b>

07:05.070 --> 07:07.400
<b>If you consider my victory to be odd,</b>

07:07.400 --> 07:10.960
<b>a victory by default would be equally odd.</b>

07:11.910 --> 07:13.410
<b>What?!</b>

07:17.680 --> 07:19.580
<b>None of that matters...</b>

07:20.660 --> 07:21.790
<b>Come on...</b>

07:22.320 --> 07:25.790
<b>I want to get this lecture 
over with so I can leave.</b>

07:28.820 --> 07:29.920
<b>Hey, now...</b>

07:30.150 --> 07:32.680
<b>None of that matters!</b>

07:36.650 --> 07:39.560
<b>It's pointless to argue over whether 
someone should have passed.</b>

07:40.100 --> 07:42.100
<b>If you aren't happy about passing,</b>

07:42.100 --> 07:44.810
<b>keep working until you're satisfied.</b>

07:44.810 --> 07:49.320
<b>If Killua retakes the Hunter Exam, 
he'll definitely pass!</b>

07:50.150 --> 07:53.660
<b>It's unfortunate that he failed this time, 
but it is what it is.</b>

07:55.110 --> 07:56.330
<b>What does matter...</b>

07:56.830 --> 08:01.580
<b>If you've been forcing Killua to kill, 
against his will, all this time,</b>

08:03.070 --> 08:05.040
<b>I'll make you pay!</b>

08:06.970 --> 08:08.490
<b>Make me pay?</b>

08:09.010 --> 08:11.150
<b>What, exactly, will you do?</b>

08:11.690 --> 08:13.030
<b>I won't do anything.</b>

08:13.490 --> 08:17.510
<b>Only, once I rescue Killua, 
I'll never let you see him again!</b>

08:33.030 --> 08:34.110
<b>Ahem.</b>

08:34.530 --> 08:37.620
<b>Is everyone finished?</b>

08:38.030 --> 08:39.950
<b>Gon is absolutely correct.</b>

08:39.950 --> 08:44.120
<b>You must decide for yourselves 
if you were worthy of passing.</b>

08:44.700 --> 08:48.370
<b>You may complain about 
the results all you like,</b>

08:48.370 --> 08:50.880
<b>but we will not be changing our minds.</b>

08:51.720 --> 08:54.130
<b>Killua has been disqualified.</b>

08:54.680 --> 08:58.140
<b>And the rest of you have passed the exam.</b>

09:05.560 --> 09:09.150
<b>Okay, then I shall continue the orientation.</b>

09:10.850 --> 09:14.650
<b>The cards I've passed out 
are your Hunter Licenses.</b>

09:16.160 --> 09:17.480
<b>This card allows you</b>

09:17.480 --> 09:21.530
<b>to enter 90% of the countries 
that limit immigration,</b>

09:21.530 --> 09:26.670
<b>as well as 75% of the restricted 
areas in the world.</b>

09:27.040 --> 09:28.420
<b>Crazy...</b>

09:29.680 --> 09:34.130
<b>This card also provides free access 
to 95% of public facilities,</b>

09:34.130 --> 09:37.530
<b>and a line of credit that rivals 
large corporations.</b>

09:39.930 --> 09:42.930
<b>If you sell the card, you'll have enough 
money to last seven lifetimes.</b>

09:42.930 --> 09:46.230
<b>And if you keep it, you'll still 
be living in comfort.</b>

09:48.980 --> 09:53.440
<b>So take extra care that your 
license isn't lost or stolen.</b>

09:53.930 --> 09:55.610
<b>You won't receive a replacement.</b>

09:57.090 --> 10:00.470
<b>According to our estimates, 
one in five Hunters</b>

10:00.470 --> 10:05.060
<b>lose their card within a year of receiving it.</b>

10:06.260 --> 10:11.090
<b>As a Hunter, your first challenge 
is to protect your card.</b>

10:12.450 --> 10:14.090
<b>The rest is up to you.</b>

10:14.560 --> 10:17.090
<b>Rise above challenges, 
believe in your own strength,</b>

10:17.090 --> 10:19.360
<b>and fulfill your dreams.</b>

10:20.860 --> 10:21.600
<b>Then,</b>

10:22.020 --> 10:27.600
<b>we now declare the seven members 
here to be new Hunters!</b>

10:33.110 --> 10:43.200
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

10:39.150 --> 10:43.200
<b>License</b>

10:48.720 --> 10:49.970
<b>Gittarackur...</b>

10:58.970 --> 11:01.470
<b>Tell me where Killua is.</b>

11:02.000 --> 11:03.990
<b>Are you really going to take him away?</b>

11:04.630 --> 11:06.480
<b>I think that's a bad idea.</b>

11:06.480 --> 11:08.230
<b>I don't care what you think!</b>

11:09.130 --> 11:11.090
<b>Killua is my friend.</b>

11:11.090 --> 11:12.730
<b>I'm taking him with me.</b>

11:13.970 --> 11:15.840
<b>Do they feel the same way?</b>

11:17.250 --> 11:18.500
<b>You bet.</b>

11:24.300 --> 11:25.240
<b>Fine.</b>

11:25.690 --> 11:28.540
<b>I doubt you'll be able to 
make it there anyway.</b>

11:29.110 --> 11:31.500
<b>Killua went home.</b>

11:31.500 --> 11:32.500
<b>Home?</b>

11:33.930 --> 11:35.640
<b>Kukuroo Mountain.</b>

11:36.070 --> 11:39.510
<b>Our family lives at the very top.</b>

11:39.910 --> 11:41.670
<b>Kukuroo Mountain?</b>

11:41.670 --> 11:43.500
<b>Got it. Thanks.</b>

11:47.040 --> 11:48.750
<b>Is it really okay</b>

11:48.750 --> 11:51.770
<b>for an assassin to give away 
his base of operations?</b>

11:52.490 --> 11:55.330
<b>Sure, it isn't a secret or anything.</b>

11:55.330 --> 11:57.270
<b>The locals all know where we live.</b>

11:57.840 --> 12:00.750
<b>Well, I'm sure they'll see the 
light once they arrive.</b>

12:00.750 --> 12:04.010
<b>We live in completely different worlds...</b>

12:05.570 --> 12:07.280
<b>Oh, this?</b>

12:07.870 --> 12:10.040
<b>Yep, it's broken.</b>

12:14.990 --> 12:16.970
<b>He has incredible potential.</b>

12:17.370 --> 12:20.550
<b>I can understand why you want 
to see him grow up.</b>

12:22.870 --> 12:24.300
<b>Didn't I tell you?</b>

12:25.640 --> 12:30.240
<b><i>But that makes him all the more dangerous.</i></b>

12:31.450 --> 12:33.750
<b><i>This would be the best chance to...</i></b>

12:38.050 --> 12:40.640
<b>Gon is my prey.</b>

12:40.640 --> 12:43.860
<b>Touch him, and you'll suffer 
the consequences.</b>

12:44.610 --> 12:46.240
<b>I know.</b>

12:46.240 --> 12:49.490
<b>I've only known you for a short while, 
but I know your tastes.</b>

12:50.480 --> 12:52.300
<b>So, Hisoka.</b>

12:53.260 --> 12:55.250
<b>What are you going to do now?</b>

12:56.270 --> 12:58.490
<b>Wait patiently.</b>

13:03.400 --> 13:06.820
<b>For the fruit to ripen...</b>

13:09.180 --> 13:11.400
<b>Kukuroo Mountain?</b>

13:11.400 --> 13:12.770
<b>Never heard of it before.</b>

13:13.050 --> 13:15.340
<b>Kurapika, do you know where it is?</b>

13:15.920 --> 13:17.360
<b>Hey, Kurapika!</b>

13:17.360 --> 13:18.270
<b>Huh?</b>

13:18.760 --> 13:21.040
<b>Oh, what is it?</b>

13:21.040 --> 13:22.390
<b>The mountain!</b>

13:22.390 --> 13:24.920
<b>He said something about Kukuroo Mountain.</b>

13:24.920 --> 13:26.780
<b>Do you know where it might be?</b>

13:26.780 --> 13:29.270
<b>No, I don't...</b>

13:29.270 --> 13:31.310
<b>We can look it up online.</b>

13:33.660 --> 13:34.530
<b>Yo!</b>

13:35.450 --> 13:37.540
<b>Oh, Hanzo-san!</b>

13:38.530 --> 13:40.220
<b>I'm going back to my country.</b>

13:40.220 --> 13:43.430
<b>It was a short, yet seemingly long 
acquaintance, but I had fun.</b>

13:43.430 --> 13:44.800
<b>So did I.</b>

13:45.180 --> 13:48.290
<b>If you ever visit my country, let me know.</b>

13:48.290 --> 13:51.320
<b>I can show you the best tourist spots!</b>

13:52.950 --> 13:53.980
<b>See ya!</b>

13:54.730 --> 13:55.950
<b>Bye!</b>

13:58.810 --> 14:00.810
<b>Cloud-Hidden Ninja

<b>A shinobi who tries to leave an impression...</b>

14:04.500 --> 14:05.170
<b>Hey.</b>

14:08.590 --> 14:11.700
<b>Sorry about getting so excited back there.</b>

14:12.160 --> 14:14.520
<b>No, I also lost control.</b>

14:14.520 --> 14:15.810
<b>Forgive me.</b>

14:16.640 --> 14:20.580
<b>No, I only got mad because you were right.</b>

14:21.560 --> 14:25.590
<b>I was using you to take out my 
frustration for winning by default.</b>

14:26.040 --> 14:27.730
<b>But I'm over that now.</b>

14:27.730 --> 14:30.340
<b>Since I passed, I'm going to make the best of it!</b>

14:31.460 --> 14:34.570
<b>The question is what to do next.</b>

14:34.570 --> 14:36.350
<b>Yes, you're right.</b>

14:36.870 --> 14:40.580
<b>I'm going to travel the world,

14:40.580 --> 14:44.860
<b>and discovering new species,

<b>An Exotic Game Hunter...</b>

14:46.960 --> 14:48.980
<b>Hey, what's that?</b>

14:48.980 --> 14:50.080
<b>Oh, this?</b>

<b>You can use this to obtain

15:48.300 --> 15:49.450
<b>Bye!</b>

15:52.910 --> 15:56.090
<b>We should have asked him to 
look up Kukuroo Mountain.</b>

15:56.090 --> 15:57.310
<b>That's right.</b>

15:57.570 --> 15:58.540
<b>It's okay.</b>

15:58.540 --> 16:02.620
<b>As Chairman Netero was saying, 
we are all Hunters now.</b>

16:02.620 --> 16:06.730
<b>It's a bad idea to let other Hunters 
know what you're doing.</b>

16:06.730 --> 16:08.670
<b>We can look it up ourselves.</b>

16:09.730 --> 16:10.820
<b>Gon-kun.</b>

16:14.880 --> 16:16.130
<b>Satotz-san!</b>

16:19.070 --> 16:21.230
<b>Gon-kun, you forgot this.</b>

16:21.750 --> 16:23.070
<b>Oh, right...</b>

16:23.070 --> 16:24.130
<b>Thanks!</b>

16:24.860 --> 16:26.960
<b>And do you have a moment?</b>

16:29.070 --> 16:31.060
<b>We'll be waiting in the lobby.</b>

16:31.060 --> 16:31.820
<b>Okay!</b>

16:38.150 --> 16:42.140
<b>Forgive me, but I couldn't help but 
overhear your conversation.</b>

16:42.520 --> 16:46.460
<b>I happen to specialize in the 
discovery, restoration,</b>

16:46.460 --> 16:48.470
<b>and preservation of ancient ruins.</b>

16:48.470 --> 16:49.790
<b>When I first began,</b>

16:49.790 --> 16:52.480
<b>I was only focused on the glory 
derived from new discoveries.</b>

16:53.540 --> 16:55.660
<b>But after watching a certain Hunter at work,</b>

16:55.660 --> 16:58.030
<b>I came to feel ashamed.</b>

17:03.330 --> 17:05.980
<b>That Hunter would discover ruins,</b>

17:06.420 --> 17:10.120
<b>spend his own money to 
completely restore them,</b>

17:10.600 --> 17:14.020
<b>and take steps to preserve the 
ruins for future generations,</b>

17:14.610 --> 17:18.860
<b>thus ensuring that ordinary people 
would have a chance to see them.</b>

17:20.220 --> 17:22.630
<b>I was more impressed by 
his dedication to his job</b>

17:22.630 --> 17:25.540
<b>than by the beauty of the ruins.</b>

17:26.970 --> 17:29.840
<b>The work he did to preserve those ruins</b>

17:29.840 --> 17:34.150
<b>has been documented in manuals 
used around the world.</b>

17:34.830 --> 17:37.660
<b>And this Hunter, Gon-kun,</b>

17:38.430 --> 17:42.820
<b>was Ging Freecss, the man 
you were asking about.</b>

17:47.670 --> 17:50.320
<b>I wished to meet him,</b>

17:50.320 --> 17:52.920
<b>so I did some investigating.</b>

17:53.480 --> 17:56.700
<b>However, quite frankly, he is an enigma.</b>

17:56.700 --> 17:59.930
<b>I wasn't able to learn anything about him...</b>

17:59.930 --> 18:02.280
<b>Really? Figures.</b>

18:03.830 --> 18:06.940
<b>My goal is to become a Hunter like him.</b>

18:07.700 --> 18:11.410
<b>My dream is to thank him in person one day.</b>

18:12.950 --> 18:13.770
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

18:16.170 --> 18:17.790
<b>That's all I had to say.</b>

18:18.740 --> 18:21.030
<b>Sorry for interrupting you.</b>

18:21.410 --> 18:24.420
<b>It's okay. Thanks for everything, Satotz-san.</b>

18:24.420 --> 18:25.160
<b>Bye!</b>

18:25.160 --> 18:25.700
<b>Oh...</b>

18:25.700 --> 18:27.110
<b>Gon-kun.</b>

18:28.480 --> 18:29.710
<b>Hmm?</b>

18:31.230 --> 18:32.890
<b>Oh, never mind...</b>

18:33.370 --> 18:35.210
<b>Take care of yourself.</b>

18:36.290 --> 18:38.350
<b>Yeah. You, too.</b>

18:38.970 --> 18:39.720
<b>Bye!</b>

18:48.700 --> 18:51.310
<b>First, let's look up Kukuroo Mountain.</b>

18:51.310 --> 18:52.020
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:52.980 --> 18:55.280
<b>Kukuroo Mountain...</b>

18:55.810 --> 18:56.990
<b>There it is.</b>

18:57.810 --> 18:59.530
<b>"Kukuroo Mountain.</b>

18:59.530 --> 19:02.370
<b>A 3,722 meter-high mountain,</b>

19:02.370 --> 19:04.990
<b>in the Dentora region of 
the Republic of Padokea."</b>

19:05.520 --> 19:07.330
<b>The Republic of Padokea?</b>

19:07.330 --> 19:08.740
<b>Never heard of it.</b>

19:08.740 --> 19:10.020
<b>Where is it?</b>

19:10.020 --> 19:11.250
<b>Hold on.</b>

19:11.250 --> 19:12.760
<b>I'll bring up a map.</b>

19:15.140 --> 19:17.010
<b>This is the Republic of Padokea.</b>

19:17.790 --> 19:20.440
<b>It should be fine. 
It appears to be a stable country.</b>

19:20.440 --> 19:23.010
<b>It allows ordinary tourists.</b>

19:23.560 --> 19:25.330
<b>That's where we'll find Killua?</b>

19:25.330 --> 19:28.230
<b>By airship, it will take three days to reach...</b>

19:28.230 --> 19:29.690
<b>When do we leave?</b>

19:29.690 --> 19:30.980
<b>Today! Right now!</b>

19:30.980 --> 19:32.980
<b>Yeah, no objection from me!</b>

19:32.980 --> 19:35.970
<b>Understood. Then, I'll order tickets.</b>

19:43.860 --> 19:44.950
<b>What's going on?</b>

19:45.660 --> 19:47.760
<b>We've been stuck in one place forever.</b>

19:47.760 --> 19:49.100
<b>This won't do.</b>

19:49.100 --> 19:51.620
<b>We'll be late for our flight.</b>

19:52.820 --> 19:55.020
<b>Pops! Do something!</b>

19:55.020 --> 19:57.100
<b>I'm afraid I can't help this traffic.</b>

19:57.100 --> 19:58.800
<b>And this is the only road.</b>

19:58.800 --> 19:59.720
<b>In that case...</b>

20:09.050 --> 20:11.580
<b>Yahoo!</b>

20:18.840 --> 20:20.110
<b>Hey, Gon!</b>

20:20.110 --> 20:22.610
<b>Do you realize how far away the airport is?</b>

20:23.220 --> 20:27.700
<b>I want to rescue Killua as soon 
as humanly possible!</b>

20:31.040 --> 20:32.920
<b>Fine, you win.</b>

20:35.690 --> 20:39.130
<b>This reminds me of the Hunter Exam.</b>

20:39.130 --> 20:39.880
<b>That's right.</b>

20:42.650 --> 20:45.800
<b>This is nothing compared 
to the Hunter Exam.</b>

20:46.890 --> 20:48.390
<b>Yeah...</b>

20:49.800 --> 20:50.980
<b>You got that right.</b>

20:55.590 --> 20:56.790
<b>Okay...</b>

20:56.790 --> 20:58.570
<b>Race you to the airport!</b>

21:00.820 --> 21:02.150
<b>Ready...</b>

21:02.640 --> 21:03.880
<b>Go!</b>

21:05.330 --> 21:09.460
<b>Gon and his friends set off for 
the Republic of Padokea.</b>

21:09.460 --> 21:13.890
<b>Their destination is Kukuroo Mountain, 
where Killua's home is located.</b>

21:24.770 --> 21:26.140
<b>Satotz.</b>

21:26.750 --> 21:28.490
<b>Menchi. Buhara.</b>

21:29.780 --> 21:31.360
<b>Hey, Satotz...</b>

21:31.360 --> 21:33.160
<b>That was a close call.</b>

21:34.510 --> 21:36.070
<b>You were watching?</b>

21:37.460 --> 21:39.500
<b>That boy is a mystery...</b>

21:39.500 --> 21:41.440
<b>I find myself wanting to help him.</b>

21:44.440 --> 21:46.660
<b>I almost let the cat out of the bag.</b>

21:47.960 --> 21:50.440
<b>About how the real Hunter Exam</b>

21:51.160 --> 21:53.500
<b>hasn't ended yet.</b>

23:27.260 --> 23:29.680
<b>Next time: A x Dangerous x Watchdog!</b>

23:29.680 --> 23:31.150
<b>Fetch, doggie!</b>

23:31.150 --> 23:31.810
<b>That's it...</b>

23:31.810 --> 23:33.170
<b>Roll over, doggie!</b>

23:33.170 --> 23:34.600
<b>Oh, yeah!</b>
