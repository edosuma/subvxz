<i>It's in the center of the circle in
Kingfisher County, moving northeast.</i>

01:37.011 --> 01:41.611
<i>Also, I do want to say to you folks
back to the West, a little bit earlier-</i>

01:42.752 --> 01:45.504
<i>Tornado warning continues now
and has been extended officially.</i>

01:45.546 --> 01:49.508
<i>I gave this to you earlier.
It's extended over into Oklahoma Cou-</i>

01:50.593 --> 01:54.180
<i>They're calling all of
Oklahoma County right now...</i>

02:10.780 --> 02:12.740
Jo common.

02:12.990 --> 02:16.744
- What is it, Mommy?
- We have to get up.

02:16.994 --> 02:18.746
We must go to the storm cellar!

02:18.996 --> 02:20.748
What's happening?

02:20.998 --> 02:21.749
Come on, sweetie.

02:21.999 --> 02:23.793
Hurry!

02:24.001 --> 02:26.754
Mommy's got you.

02:27.004 --> 02:28.756
TV says it's big.

02:29.006 --> 02:33.511
We're going to the storm cellar.

02:36.013 --> 02:37.765
We must move! Hand her to me!

02:38.015 --> 02:42.520
Come on! Let's move.

02:45.022 --> 02:49.527
Go to the center of your
house if there's no cellar.

02:56.033 --> 02:59.495
My Lord!

02:59.995 --> 03:03.749
Come on!

03:03.999 --> 03:05.751
We're almost there!

03:06.001 --> 03:07.753
Take her! Take her!

03:08.003 --> 03:10.506
I'll get the door!

03:12.007 --> 03:13.759
- Get in!
- Hurry!

03:14.009 --> 03:15.761
It's coming!

03:16.011 --> 03:16.762
Quick!

03:17.012 --> 03:21.517
Light the lamp!

03:23.018 --> 03:26.772
Daddy! Toby's still outside!

03:27.022 --> 03:28.774
Toby, come on, boy!

03:29.024 --> 03:29.775
Good boy!

03:30.025 --> 03:34.530
It's okay, Toby.

03:42.037 --> 03:43.789
Grab Jo!

03:44.039 --> 03:48.544
Daddy!

03:52.047 --> 03:55.551
Take Jo!

04:03.017 --> 04:04.768
God!

04:05.019 --> 04:08.772
I can't hold it.

04:09.023 --> 04:12.776
Jesus! Oh, God!

04:13.027 --> 04:16.529
I can't hold it!

04:38.052 --> 04:41.555
Stay with me, Jo!

05:12.044 --> 05:18.550
At 7 a. m. in Oklahoma City,
the temperature is 75 degrees.

05:27.059 --> 05:29.812
Look, caps are already
starting to break.

05:30.062 --> 05:34.817
All the models are forecasting
lifted indices from -6 to -10.

05:35.067 --> 05:39.780
If the cells keep building, there could be
a record outbreak of tornados.

05:40.030 --> 05:44.576
This is going to be a long day.

06:10.060 --> 06:12.813
Are you sure she'll be there?

06:13.063 --> 06:15.816
If I know Jo, she's already dragged
her department into the field.

06:16.066 --> 06:20.821
Day like today, it's to be expected.
She forgets everything except work.

06:21.071 --> 06:21.822
You're nervous.

06:22.072 --> 06:23.824
Nervous?

06:24.074 --> 06:24.825
No.

06:25.075 --> 06:26.827
Do I look nervous?

06:27.077 --> 06:27.828
No.

06:28.078 --> 06:31.790
Well, yeah, you do a little. You know.

06:32.040 --> 06:32.791
I want to get it over with.

06:33.041 --> 06:35.836
She said she signed the papers?

06:36.086 --> 06:37.838
That's what she said.

06:38.088 --> 06:40.799
You don't think so?

06:41.049 --> 06:42.801
I think so.

06:43.051 --> 06:46.555
Give me a kiss.

06:51.059 --> 06:56.565
Okay, Professor! Hang on there.
I think I fixed it.

06:57.065 --> 06:58.817
I got it.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.819
Fuck me! This thing is useless!

07:01.069 --> 07:04.573
Sorry!

07:05.073 --> 07:05.824
Wait, wait!

07:06.074 --> 07:08.827
Good! Give me a reading!

07:09.077 --> 07:13.832
Okay, boss lady, hold your horses.

07:14.082 --> 07:15.834
Which way do you want it?

07:16.084 --> 07:17.836
The dry line is stalled.

07:18.086 --> 07:25.594
Scan WNW, look at mid-levels for
rotation, and increase the P.R.F.

07:26.094 --> 07:28.805
If I mistreat you girl

07:29.056 --> 07:33.560
Sure don't mean no harm

07:40.067 --> 07:42.819
All I'm saying is, don't fold the maps.

07:43.070 --> 07:44.821
I didn't.

07:45.072 --> 07:47.824
Kansas is a mess. There's a
big crease through Wichita.

07:48.075 --> 07:52.579
Roll the maps.

07:53.080 --> 07:57.584
The storm chasers.

08:00.087 --> 08:01.838
Who's that handsome devil?

08:02.089 --> 08:03.840
Gentlemen.

08:04.091 --> 08:07.844
The Extreme! It's the Extreme!

08:08.095 --> 08:10.847
Don't start that shit.

08:11.098 --> 08:15.852
A manly handshake ensues.
How you doing, man?

08:16.103 --> 08:17.854
I'm doing great.

08:18.105 --> 08:20.857
Oh, man!

08:21.108 --> 08:24.861
I'd like you to meet Melissa.
This is Dusty.

08:25.112 --> 08:28.824
Dustman's been chasing
with us since we started.

08:29.074 --> 08:30.826
Listen...

08:31.076 --> 08:32.828
...where's Jo?

08:33.078 --> 08:35.831
She's by the Doppler.

08:36.081 --> 08:38.833
Broke down again.
Running out of grant money.

08:39.083 --> 08:42.837
Why don't you hang out here for a
little while. I'll be right back.

08:43.087 --> 08:46.842
Dusty, why don't you
explain to Melissa...

08:47.092 --> 08:50.846
...why you're the way you are.

08:51.096 --> 08:53.849
Come on.

08:54.099 --> 08:56.852
Man, Jo's going to wig
when she sees he's back.

08:57.102 --> 08:58.854
I'm not back.

08:59.104 --> 09:02.607
The prodigal son returns.

09:05.110 --> 09:09.614
Hi, Joey.

09:16.121 --> 09:19.583
Hiya, Jo.

09:21.084 --> 09:22.836
I'm happy you found us.

09:23.086 --> 09:25.839
How you doing?

09:26.089 --> 09:26.840
It's going good.

09:27.090 --> 09:30.844
You see the sky today?

09:31.094 --> 09:32.846
She's really talking.

09:33.096 --> 09:34.848
Catch.

09:35.098 --> 09:39.853
It's the biggest series of storms in
12 years. One lined up after another.

09:40.103 --> 09:41.855
N.S.S.L.'s never seen anything like it.

09:42.105 --> 09:44.858
Is that right? So, Jo,
about the divorce papers-

09:45.108 --> 09:46.860
Do you have a sec?

09:47.110 --> 09:50.614
Excuse me.

09:51.114 --> 09:52.866
This thing's acting up again.

09:53.116 --> 09:54.868
The focus mount's jammed.

09:55.118 --> 09:57.871
There's grass in the auto-focus.

09:58.121 --> 09:58.872
Should I clean it?

09:59.122 --> 10:01.875
Not unless you want to sketch tornados.

10:02.125 --> 10:02.876
Welcome back.

10:03.126 --> 10:05.879
I'm not back.

10:06.087 --> 10:09.841
You want the papers?

10:10.091 --> 10:11.843
I came here for them.

10:12.093 --> 10:13.845
They're signed and ready.

10:14.095 --> 10:14.846
Good. Let's see them.

10:15.096 --> 10:16.848
Right now?

10:17.098 --> 10:17.849
That'd be nice.

10:18.099 --> 10:20.852
What's the urgent urgency?
You act like you're getting married.

10:21.102 --> 10:24.606
I am.

10:35.116 --> 10:35.867
Is it Melinda?

10:36.117 --> 10:36.868
Melissa.

10:37.118 --> 10:38.870
Wasn't there a Melinda somewhere?

10:39.120 --> 10:40.872
There's only been Melissa since you.

10:41.122 --> 10:43.875
Not much for browsing, are you?

10:44.125 --> 10:47.629
I guess I'm not.

10:48.129 --> 10:51.633
There you go.

11:05.105 --> 11:07.857
You missed a page.

11:08.108 --> 11:11.611
Right here.

11:14.114 --> 11:18.618
Where'd this come from?

11:20.120 --> 11:20.870
What're you doing?

11:21.121 --> 11:22.872
Can I read it first?

11:23.123 --> 11:24.874
It's the same as December.

11:25.125 --> 11:25.875
I didn't read it then.

11:26.126 --> 11:29.879
Christ, would you sign it
so we can get out of here?

11:30.130 --> 11:30.880
Please.

11:31.131 --> 11:32.882
"We?" She's here?

11:33.133 --> 11:36.886
She's with Dusty. Now,
please, sign the document.

11:37.137 --> 11:38.888
With Dusty? What's wrong with you?

11:39.139 --> 11:40.890
I want to meet her.

11:41.141 --> 11:41.891
No, you don't.

11:42.142 --> 11:45.895
Christ.

11:46.146 --> 11:48.898
The suck zone.

11:49.149 --> 11:51.901
It's the point...

11:52.152 --> 11:54.904
...basically at which the twister...

11:55.155 --> 11:55.905
...sucks you up.

11:56.156 --> 12:00.869
That's not the technical
term for it, obviously.

12:01.119 --> 12:01.870
I'm Jo Harding.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.872
Nice to meet you.

12:04.122 --> 12:05.874
Bill told me the happy news.

12:06.124 --> 12:08.877
- Which?
- Us. Marriage. Jo, Melissa.

12:09.127 --> 12:10.879
It's happy news.

12:11.129 --> 12:12.881
I guess it seems sudden.

12:13.131 --> 12:13.882
Sudden?

12:14.132 --> 12:16.885
Dude, you're taking the vows?
That's sweet.

12:17.135 --> 12:20.889
We wanted to get it done before
Billy started his new job.

12:21.139 --> 12:22.891
That's right. Weatherman.

12:23.141 --> 12:24.893
What?

12:25.143 --> 12:25.894
- Don't say it.
- I said, weatherman.

12:26.144 --> 12:27.896
- It's great.
- You have that tone.

12:28.146 --> 12:29.898
If you have a problem-

12:30.148 --> 12:35.653
I don't have a problem
being a weatherman.

12:37.155 --> 12:38.907
Dr. Melissa Reeves.

12:39.157 --> 12:40.909
Very nice to meet you.

12:41.159 --> 12:44.662
You too.

12:48.124 --> 12:49.876
New truck?

12:50.126 --> 12:50.877
That's right.

12:51.127 --> 12:53.880
Boy, oh, boy. New job...

12:54.130 --> 12:55.882
...new truck...

12:56.132 --> 12:57.884
...new wife. It's a whole new you.

12:58.134 --> 12:59.886
This is awkward.

13:00.136 --> 13:00.887
Tell me.

13:01.137 --> 13:02.889
I thought you'd come alone.

13:03.139 --> 13:04.891
You said you'd meet me-

13:05.141 --> 13:06.893
It's about Dorothy.

13:07.143 --> 13:08.895
Dorothy?

13:09.145 --> 13:11.898
What about her?

13:12.148 --> 13:14.901
She's here.

13:15.151 --> 13:18.655
Show me.

13:30.166 --> 13:31.918
I can't believe you did it.

13:32.168 --> 13:34.879
We built 4.

13:35.129 --> 13:38.633
She work?

13:49.143 --> 13:50.895
Thought you'd want to be
here for her first time out.

13:51.145 --> 13:54.899
It wouldn't be right
if you weren't here.

13:55.149 --> 13:57.902
This is going to be good!

13:58.152 --> 14:00.905
How sweet is that?

14:01.155 --> 14:02.907
It's Bill's concept.

14:03.157 --> 14:05.910
The Extreme. It came from his brain.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.912
I had a hand in it.

14:08.162 --> 14:10.915
It is great.

14:11.165 --> 14:12.917
What is it?

14:13.167 --> 14:16.921
It's an instrument pack for studying
tornados. First one in history.

14:17.171 --> 14:17.922
It's very exciting.

14:18.172 --> 14:20.925
Scientists have studied
tornados forever...

14:21.175 --> 14:23.928
...but nobody knows
how a tornado works.

14:24.178 --> 14:25.930
We don't know what happens inside...

14:26.180 --> 14:29.892
...because nobody can take
measurements inside the funnel.

14:30.143 --> 14:32.895
That's what she's going to do.

14:33.146 --> 14:33.896
How?

14:34.147 --> 14:36.899
We put her up inside a tornado.

14:37.150 --> 14:39.652
She opens...

14:41.154 --> 14:43.906
...and releases hundreds
of these sensors...

14:44.157 --> 14:47.910
...that measure all parts of
the tornado simultaneously.

14:48.161 --> 14:50.913
You see, it's like this:

14:51.164 --> 14:53.916
These sensors go up the funnel
and radio back information...

14:54.167 --> 14:57.920
...about the internal structure,
wind velocities...

14:58.171 --> 15:00.923
We'll learn more in 30 seconds
than in the last 30 years.

15:01.174 --> 15:02.925
Get a profile for the first time.

15:03.176 --> 15:04.927
What will that do?

15:05.178 --> 15:08.931
If we know how tornados work,
we can design a warning system.

15:09.182 --> 15:10.933
Aren't there warnings already?

15:11.184 --> 15:13.936
- The civil defence-
- They're not good enough.

15:14.187 --> 15:14.937
Right now it's 3 minutes.

15:15.188 --> 15:18.941
If we can get this information,
we can increase it to 15.

15:19.192 --> 15:21.944
Give people a chance to get to safety.

15:22.195 --> 15:26.657
That's what they're trying to do.

15:30.161 --> 15:31.913
I can't believe you did it.

15:32.163 --> 15:35.917
Well, we did it.

15:36.167 --> 15:39.921
How do you get it in?

15:40.171 --> 15:42.924
You get in front of it and
put it in the damage path.

15:43.174 --> 15:44.926
And then get out again quickly.

15:45.176 --> 15:47.929
That's the suck zone.

15:48.179 --> 15:49.931
Excellent! We got major action!

15:50.181 --> 15:56.687
N.S.S.L. says the cap is breaking,
towers are going up 30 miles.

15:59.190 --> 16:00.942
Let's go.

16:01.192 --> 16:01.943
We're moving!

16:02.193 --> 16:03.945
It's fatty time!

16:04.195 --> 16:05.947
Laptop.

16:06.197 --> 16:10.701
We're waiting! Let's go!

16:11.202 --> 16:15.665
Joey, Haynes, a little help!

16:23.172 --> 16:23.965
Smooth.

16:24.215 --> 16:25.967
There's Dusty!

16:26.217 --> 16:28.928
Come on! You're always last!
Let's go!

16:29.178 --> 16:32.932
We're going third. Preacher follow.

16:33.182 --> 16:33.933
Get the camera!

16:34.183 --> 16:34.934
I got it!

16:35.184 --> 16:38.938
They can handle this.
They know what they're doing.

16:39.188 --> 16:41.941
This is what they do.

16:42.191 --> 16:42.942
They live for this.

16:43.192 --> 16:44.944
Dorothy 2 & 3 ready.

16:45.194 --> 16:46.946
Dorothy 4 ready.

16:47.196 --> 16:49.949
Sure you don't want to go?

16:50.199 --> 16:51.951
Go with them?

16:52.201 --> 16:55.705
No, they'll be fine.

16:56.205 --> 16:58.958
- Did she sign the papers?
- Shit!

16:59.208 --> 16:59.917
She didn't?

17:00.167 --> 17:01.919
Hurry. We can catch them!

17:02.169 --> 17:03.921
Glad you're back!

17:04.171 --> 17:05.923
I'm not back!

17:06.173 --> 17:06.924
Rabbit.

17:07.174 --> 17:08.925
Yeah, boss?

17:09.175 --> 17:13.681
Can we do better than the 30?

17:15.182 --> 17:18.935
Not for a while. It's best to stay
on it until we pass the creek.

17:19.185 --> 17:21.939
Copy that.

17:22.189 --> 17:24.942
Once we catch up to them,
take the truck and go home.

17:25.192 --> 17:28.946
I'll get them signed, see you tonight.

17:29.196 --> 17:34.702
This is interesting.
I'm going to tag along.

17:49.216 --> 17:51.969
Jonas! Son-of-a-bitch!

17:52.219 --> 17:53.971
Who is that?

17:54.221 --> 17:56.974
Jonas Miller. He's a night crawler.

17:57.224 --> 18:01.937
We all started out in the same lab, then
Jonas got himself corporate sponsors.

18:02.188 --> 18:04.940
He's in it for the money,
not the science.

18:05.191 --> 18:06.942
He's got a lot of high-tech gadgets.

18:07.193 --> 18:10.946
But he's got no instincts.

18:11.197 --> 18:15.701
And he doesn't have Dorothy.

18:17.203 --> 18:21.707
I think we have fleas.

18:23.209 --> 18:24.960
Jo, come back.

18:25.211 --> 18:26.962
You change your mind?

18:27.213 --> 18:31.717
Yeah. Why's Jonas here?

18:35.221 --> 18:35.971
I'm not sure.

18:36.222 --> 18:41.727
I bet he's asking himself
the same thing about you.

18:43.229 --> 18:46.732
Shit! Hold on!

18:48.234 --> 18:52.696
God damn! Son-of-a-bitch!

18:58.244 --> 18:59.954
This essentially was a false alarm.

19:00.204 --> 19:04.708
The radar appeared solid.

19:06.210 --> 19:08.963
- How long till it's fixed?
-10 minutes, 15 tops.

19:09.213 --> 19:10.965
Sounds good.

19:11.215 --> 19:13.968
What drives me is the unknown.

19:14.218 --> 19:16.971
What if we could predict
the tornado's path?

19:17.221 --> 19:19.974
How many lives would be spared
by an early warning system?

19:20.224 --> 19:21.976
And D.O.T. 3...

19:22.226 --> 19:22.977
...is the answer.

19:23.227 --> 19:28.732
The first digital
orthographic telemeter.

19:30.234 --> 19:33.988
Inside, she holds hundreds
of these sensors which...

19:34.238 --> 19:38.993
...when released into the tornado,
transmit back data on wind speed...

19:39.243 --> 19:40.953
...pressure and dew point temperature.

19:41.203 --> 19:42.997
Why didn't you tell me?

19:43.247 --> 19:46.000
Don't.

19:46.250 --> 19:49.003
And what will soon be the
center for all studies.

19:49.253 --> 19:51.005
You shit!

19:51.255 --> 19:54.008
Think I wouldn't find out?!

19:54.258 --> 19:55.968
Get him off me!

19:56.218 --> 19:57.970
What's wrong?

19:58.220 --> 19:58.971
What's the matter?

19:59.221 --> 20:01.974
You stole my design, you bastard!

20:02.224 --> 20:03.976
What do you mean?!

20:04.226 --> 20:07.980
Dorothy. You took her, you damn thief!

20:08.230 --> 20:11.984
Oh, I get it. You want to
take credit for my design.

20:12.234 --> 20:13.986
You're a liar.

20:14.236 --> 20:15.988
She was our idea.

20:16.238 --> 20:17.990
Unrealised idea.

20:18.240 --> 20:18.991
Unrealised.

20:19.241 --> 20:21.994
That ain't worth shit unless it flies!

20:22.244 --> 20:24.997
Guys! Guys! All my guys,
get a grip on yourself.

20:25.247 --> 20:28.000
We both know he'll never
get it up in the air.

20:28.208 --> 20:31.962
Well, let me enlighten you people!

20:32.212 --> 20:33.964
This baby has satellite comlink.

20:34.214 --> 20:37.009
We got on-board pulse Doppler.

20:37.259 --> 20:39.011
We got Nexrad real time.

20:39.261 --> 20:41.972
We're going to make history.

20:42.222 --> 20:43.974
So stick around.

20:44.224 --> 20:46.977
The days of sniffing the dirt are over.

20:47.227 --> 20:47.978
Better than what you sniff.

20:48.228 --> 20:50.981
We'll see who gets there first, pal.

20:51.231 --> 20:52.983
By the way...

20:53.233 --> 20:56.987
...I really enjoy your weather reports.

20:57.237 --> 20:58.989
You slime!

20:59.239 --> 21:01.992
Come here!

21:02.242 --> 21:05.746
Get off!

21:07.247 --> 21:11.752
He's a corporate kiss-butt.

21:13.253 --> 21:16.006
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

21:16.256 --> 21:17.007
One day.

21:17.257 --> 21:21.011
I'll give you one day.
Whether she flies or not, I'm gone.

21:21.261 --> 21:23.013
Honey?

21:23.263 --> 21:24.014
Is everything okay?

21:24.264 --> 21:26.016
- Everything's fine.
- Are you sure?

21:26.266 --> 21:29.019
Yeah, everything's okay.

21:29.269 --> 21:33.982
I'm going to hang out here.
Why don't you get us some cold drinks?

21:34.233 --> 21:37.736
Okay, sweetheart.

22:03.262 --> 22:08.016
Jo, I don't know what's wrong
with Bill. He's wacko. He's crazy.

22:08.267 --> 22:09.017
You ought to get a leash on him.

22:09.268 --> 22:11.019
He's your problem, not mine.

22:11.270 --> 22:15.023
This storm's going to be a lot
bigger than we anticipated.

22:15.274 --> 22:19.027
I got reports of mesos from
Grand County to Logan.

22:19.278 --> 22:22.030
Sharing information with me?

22:22.281 --> 22:26.034
No, I was curious as to which
way you were going to head.

22:26.285 --> 22:28.996
Southeast, I think.

22:29.246 --> 22:30.998
To the counter.

22:31.248 --> 22:35.752
Two lemonades to go, please.

22:37.254 --> 22:40.007
- Nothing changes.
- Pardon me?

22:40.257 --> 22:42.009
He'll wait and see what Bill does.

22:42.259 --> 22:45.012
May I have a coffee to go?

22:45.262 --> 22:49.766
That man is waiting for Bill?
Why?

23:16.293 --> 23:20.047
You're telling me that Billy
knows what a storm is thinking?

23:20.297 --> 23:24.009
Something like that. Gum?

23:24.259 --> 23:27.012
My aunt called him a human barometer.

23:27.262 --> 23:30.015
He hasn't really told me about all this.

23:30.265 --> 23:37.773
If you must pee, do it now. There's not
many places to stop on the road.

23:39.274 --> 23:43.779
You're still in love with him.

23:49.284 --> 23:50.035
Check, please.

23:50.285 --> 23:52.037
Not that I blame you.

23:52.287 --> 23:58.794
I hope this isn't a desperate
attempt to keep him in your life.

24:00.295 --> 24:03.799
We're together.

24:12.265 --> 24:14.017
Hey, man.

24:14.267 --> 24:17.771
What's up?

24:19.272 --> 24:21.024
Going green.

24:21.274 --> 24:22.025
Greenage.

24:22.275 --> 24:25.028
- Saddle them up.
- You got it, boss.

24:25.278 --> 24:29.032
I need a sector scan on that cell.
Keep looking for a hook.

24:29.282 --> 24:31.034
What are my dew points doing?

24:31.284 --> 24:33.036
Points up to 70, sir.

24:33.286 --> 24:34.037
I got a lemonade.

24:34.287 --> 24:38.041
We must go. Follow us in the
truck, but stay behind Dusty.

24:38.291 --> 24:42.045
You'll be safe there. I must go with Jo.
Let's move out, people!

24:42.295 --> 24:45.799
Where are we going?

24:49.302 --> 24:53.807
Thanks, I'll drive.

24:55.308 --> 24:59.771
Let's pack it up. Let's go.

25:10.282 --> 25:15.787
It's a wonder of nature baby!

25:39.311 --> 25:43.815
Hey, you guys!

26:06.296 --> 26:10.050
Dr. Melissa Reeves here.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.052
Hello, Donald.

26:12.302 --> 26:16.806
No, you got me in my car.

26:17.307 --> 26:19.059
Oklahoma

26:19.309 --> 26:23.063
Where the wind comes
sweeping down the plain

26:23.313 --> 26:24.064
And the waving wheat

26:24.314 --> 26:29.069
This feeling of inadequacy is coming
from you. Julia doesn't resent you.

26:29.319 --> 26:32.072
We've talked about this before.

26:32.322 --> 26:35.075
She did not marry your penis.

26:35.325 --> 26:41.831
Okay. All right.
She didn't only marry your penis.

26:44.334 --> 26:45.085
So?

26:45.335 --> 26:47.087
So...

26:47.295 --> 26:49.047
Amazing coloring there, isn't it?

26:49.297 --> 26:51.049
Look at the mammatas.

26:51.299 --> 26:54.052
Those tops have got to be
spiking about 40,000 feet.

26:54.302 --> 26:59.057
- It's a good thing.
- It's a very good thing.

26:59.307 --> 27:01.059
You met her at the station?

27:01.309 --> 27:04.062
- I don't want to fight.
- I'm not fighting. I'm talking.

27:04.312 --> 27:07.816
I don't want to fight.

27:08.316 --> 27:11.069
She's nice.

27:11.319 --> 27:13.071
She's not nice?

27:13.321 --> 27:15.073
- I know what you meant.
- You do?

27:15.323 --> 27:16.074
Don't do this.

27:16.324 --> 27:21.079
I'm making civilised conversation here.
You're biting my head off.

27:21.329 --> 27:23.081
Jesus.

27:23.331 --> 27:26.084
Yes, she's very nice.

27:26.334 --> 27:31.840
No, she does not work at the station.

27:32.340 --> 27:36.803
She's a therapist.

27:41.307 --> 27:42.058
Yours?

27:42.308 --> 27:44.060
You couldn't resist it.

27:44.310 --> 27:47.063
I'm not saying you need therapy.

27:47.313 --> 27:49.065
Wait. I need therapy?

27:49.315 --> 27:50.066
I didn't say that.

27:50.316 --> 27:52.068
Why would I need a therapist?

27:52.318 --> 27:55.071
- I don't know.
- You're the doctor.

27:55.321 --> 27:58.074
I don't know...

27:58.324 --> 28:00.076
...inability to finish things.

28:00.326 --> 28:03.079
Maybe rushing into things
you can't quite commit to.

28:03.329 --> 28:04.080
You asked me.

28:04.330 --> 28:06.082
You asked me!

28:06.332 --> 28:10.086
Bullshit! I may have walked out, but at
least I showed up in the first place!

28:10.336 --> 28:13.089
- You never had an idea.
- There's a road thing going on.

28:13.339 --> 28:16.092
You never knew what
being married means...

28:16.342 --> 28:21.097
...like stability and supportiveness
and a house and neat stuff like that!

28:21.347 --> 28:22.098
I'll drive.

28:22.348 --> 28:24.851
Then would you?

28:27.353 --> 28:30.815
Goddamn.

28:32.317 --> 28:35.069
Someone should warn
her about your temper.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.071
She obviously has no idea.

28:37.322 --> 28:40.074
Stay out of it. I know what I'm doing.

28:40.325 --> 28:41.075
What are you doing?

28:41.326 --> 28:44.078
They're getting better at this.

28:44.329 --> 28:46.080
You know what? If you're happy...

28:46.331 --> 28:48.082
Thank you.

28:48.333 --> 28:51.085
I am happy. I'm a happy person.

28:51.336 --> 28:55.089
I'm happy with the way
things are going in my life.

28:55.340 --> 28:58.092
- I'm happy with-with-with-
- Melissa?

28:58.343 --> 29:00.094
I know her name! Yes, with Melissa.

29:00.345 --> 29:02.096
You look happy.

29:02.347 --> 29:03.097
I am!

29:03.348 --> 29:07.852
Shit. Shit!

29:08.353 --> 29:12.106
You going to wrap this up soon?

29:12.357 --> 29:13.107
What?

29:13.358 --> 29:17.111
Are we going to chase this tornado or
do you want to catch the next one?

29:17.362 --> 29:20.114
Shit!

29:20.365 --> 29:23.117
- Is it on the ground?
- I got it.

29:23.368 --> 29:26.871
Easy.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.093
Bear right. It's on an easterly course.

29:40.343 --> 29:45.098
The Weather Service has issued
a tornado warning till 11 a. m.

29:45.348 --> 29:47.100
Dr. Miller?

29:47.350 --> 29:49.102
I think they turned left.

29:49.352 --> 29:52.855
Do it.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.112
We'll intercept. Get ready to set up.

29:59.362 --> 30:03.866
You got it.

30:10.373 --> 30:13.126
- Get further ahead of it.
- I know what I'm doing.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.127
Cut across.

30:14.335 --> 30:16.087
- Get into that field.
- I'll get ahead of it.

30:16.337 --> 30:18.089
Want to drive?

30:18.339 --> 30:21.092
- Would you like to drive?
- I'd love to.

30:21.342 --> 30:26.889
Distances are about 3 miles south-east.
Let's see what she does.

30:29.350 --> 30:30.101
Go in there.

30:30.351 --> 30:32.103
You'll miss it.

30:32.353 --> 30:34.105
Hold on a second.

30:34.355 --> 30:37.859
Lost your nerve?

30:38.359 --> 30:41.863
Tighten your seat belt.

30:45.366 --> 30:50.872
Where are you? We lost visual.

30:55.376 --> 30:57.128
Having fun?

30:57.378 --> 30:58.129
We must get out of this.

30:58.379 --> 31:01.883
Really?

31:02.383 --> 31:05.094
2 miles. Picking up speed.

31:05.344 --> 31:07.096
Sometime this week would be good.

31:07.346 --> 31:10.850
I'm trying.

31:11.350 --> 31:12.101
You mad?

31:12.351 --> 31:15.104
I will be later. Now I'm
trying not to kill us.

31:15.354 --> 31:21.861
Funnel's getting thicker!
It's moving fast! Coming towards you!

31:25.364 --> 31:26.115
It's turning!

31:26.365 --> 31:28.117
- I can't see it.
- You will!

31:28.367 --> 31:31.120
You're too close! It won't work!
Get out!

31:31.370 --> 31:35.124
Oh, shit!

31:35.374 --> 31:38.127
It's too steep.

31:38.377 --> 31:42.882
This was a great idea!

31:53.392 --> 31:56.145
That wasn't so bad. Let's go!

31:56.395 --> 32:00.858
Why can't we spend a
normal day together?

32:02.360 --> 32:06.155
We're in the damage path!
This is crazy! Forget it!

32:06.364 --> 32:09.116
- No, it's going to hit us!
- We can still do this!

32:09.367 --> 32:14.872
There's no time! Come on! Come on!

32:16.374 --> 32:18.125
Grab hold of something!

32:18.376 --> 32:21.879
I know!

32:31.389 --> 32:33.140
What are you doing?!

32:33.391 --> 32:34.141
I want to see it!

32:34.392 --> 32:36.143
Come back!

32:36.394 --> 32:39.897
Come on!

32:52.410 --> 32:54.870
Look out!

33:23.399 --> 33:27.903
Oh, God.

33:29.405 --> 33:33.159
Oh, my God!

33:33.409 --> 33:35.161
It's gone.

33:35.411 --> 33:38.164
It's gone.

33:38.414 --> 33:41.876
Where's my truck?

33:45.421 --> 33:48.174
There it is.

33:48.424 --> 33:50.176
Oh, God!

33:50.426 --> 33:53.929
Are you okay?

33:54.430 --> 33:56.182
Are you okay?

33:56.390 --> 33:58.142
You just missed that truck!

33:58.392 --> 33:59.143
Awesome!

33:59.393 --> 34:02.146
That's awesome!

34:02.396 --> 34:04.148
Oh, God, Billy!

34:04.398 --> 34:06.150
Are you okay?

34:06.400 --> 34:08.152
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

34:08.402 --> 34:10.154
She just missed the truck.

34:10.404 --> 34:12.156
What happened to you?

34:12.406 --> 34:16.159
Nothing, we're okay. We were safe.

34:16.409 --> 34:18.161
It's trashed.

34:18.411 --> 34:19.163
Hang on.

34:19.413 --> 34:24.168
It's over. It's over. It's all over.

34:24.418 --> 34:27.170
Are you okay?

34:27.420 --> 34:31.884
She's okay.

34:36.388 --> 34:38.181
There is some good news.

34:38.431 --> 34:41.936
It did fly.

34:42.436 --> 34:45.147
What was it like?

34:45.397 --> 34:47.149
It was windy.

34:47.399 --> 34:48.150
Windy.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.152
That's intense.

34:50.402 --> 34:52.154
Move it.

34:52.404 --> 34:53.155
That's intense.

34:53.405 --> 34:57.159
The Auto Club's here.

34:57.409 --> 35:02.164
Maybe we should stop,
see if they need help.

35:02.414 --> 35:04.166
They're fine.
Pay attention to the road.

35:04.416 --> 35:08.170
You're fashionably late again.

35:08.420 --> 35:10.172
Give me a kiss.

35:10.422 --> 35:14.176
Get out of here! Get out of here!

35:14.426 --> 35:16.178
Loser!

35:16.428 --> 35:17.179
Find your own twister!

35:17.429 --> 35:19.181
Losers!

35:19.431 --> 35:22.184
Move on!

35:22.434 --> 35:25.187
Tough luck, you guys!

35:25.437 --> 35:27.189
Let's go.

35:27.439 --> 35:30.192
I'll get them clean.
Let's get Dorothy 2 ready.

35:30.442 --> 35:33.153
You got full coverage on that truck?

35:33.404 --> 35:36.156
Liability only.

35:36.407 --> 35:40.911
Liability only.

35:43.414 --> 35:44.164
It's a pretty truck.

35:44.415 --> 35:48.919
Thank you.

35:50.421 --> 35:54.174
Don't even think about it.

35:54.425 --> 35:58.929
No way.

35:59.430 --> 36:06.937
This is the caboose! This is the
caboose! I'm waiting for orders.

36:08.439 --> 36:09.189
Go ahead.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.192
- It's your truck.
- No, you should.

36:12.443 --> 36:15.195
The battle zone should
be north-east of 81.

36:15.446 --> 36:17.197
The battle zone?

36:17.448 --> 36:18.198
What're we doing?

36:18.449 --> 36:20.200
We're going again.

36:20.451 --> 36:23.203
But back there you almost got killed!

36:23.454 --> 36:25.205
Just a close call.

36:25.456 --> 36:29.168
You're going to cross 15
at Oklahoma 412. 412.

36:29.418 --> 36:32.171
Copy that. Haynes,
what's on the Mesonet?

36:32.421 --> 36:36.925
Winds are continuing to back.

36:37.426 --> 36:41.930
Okay, guys, lets go get it.

37:27.434 --> 37:28.185
Mobile lab.

37:28.435 --> 37:31.188
Is it me, or is the
main updraft shifting?

37:31.438 --> 37:34.191
Upper-level winds are veering.

37:34.441 --> 37:37.194
It might dissipate. Do we have
time to get in front of it?

37:37.444 --> 37:42.199
Rotation is increasing. Shear is
90 knots. 50 outbound, 40 inbound.

37:42.449 --> 37:45.202
We see a very pronounced hook.

37:45.452 --> 37:47.204
Checking for you now.

37:47.454 --> 37:50.207
We're getting south-east
gusts at 40 miles per hour.

37:50.457 --> 37:52.209
Approaching 150 in the funnel.

37:52.459 --> 37:56.213
Storm motion is 225 degrees
out of the south-west.

37:56.463 --> 38:00.968
We're in position. Proceed.

38:12.437 --> 38:14.189
Howdy!

38:14.439 --> 38:18.944
Must admire their spirit.

38:22.447 --> 38:25.951
There's your pal.

38:30.455 --> 38:33.959
What're you doing?

38:37.462 --> 38:39.214
Look at the updraft.

38:39.464 --> 38:40.215
The angle.

38:40.465 --> 38:42.217
It's going to shift course.

38:42.467 --> 38:44.219
You sure?

38:44.469 --> 38:46.221
It's definitely a sidewinder.

38:46.471 --> 38:47.222
It'll move left.

38:47.472 --> 38:49.224
- Is that bad?
- Was there a road?

38:49.474 --> 38:52.978
You're right! Go!

39:14.458 --> 39:17.210
Donald, now's not a good time.

39:17.461 --> 39:21.965
All right, put Julia on, Donny.

39:22.466 --> 39:26.219
Looking very good.

39:26.470 --> 39:32.976
About a 4 miles up, hang a right,
let's deploy and we'll be done.

39:34.478 --> 39:36.229
Shit!

39:36.480 --> 39:39.232
Shit, it's moving away!

39:39.483 --> 39:43.987
Looks like they'll intercept.

39:46.490 --> 39:52.996
You told me this thing was going
to stay on the same heading!

39:53.497 --> 39:55.248
We're close.

39:55.499 --> 39:57.250
I know.

39:57.501 --> 39:59.211
Where does this road take us?

39:59.461 --> 40:02.214
It feels unnatural, but
with Donald's motility...

40:02.464 --> 40:07.219
...you won't have a baby the usual
way, even standing on your head.

40:07.469 --> 40:10.222
She's a reproductive therapist.

40:10.472 --> 40:12.224
Laurence- Damn.

40:12.474 --> 40:16.228
We must get ahead of this storm.

40:16.478 --> 40:17.229
Be right with you.

40:17.479 --> 40:20.232
I can't talk now. I'll call you back.

40:20.482 --> 40:23.235
South. Shifting due south, copy.

40:23.485 --> 40:27.239
We have an F-2, ladies and
gentlemen. Possibly F-3.

40:27.489 --> 40:33.245
Read me? There's very, very large
rope on the ground. Very large.

40:33.495 --> 40:37.249
It looks like it's turning.
The atmosphere is unstable.

40:37.499 --> 40:38.250
Repeat, unstable!

40:38.500 --> 40:39.251
This is Rabbit!

40:39.501 --> 40:42.254
It's heading this way!

40:42.504 --> 40:43.255
This is Sanders.

40:43.505 --> 40:47.259
We are driving due east on a
road we've been on for 6 miles.

40:47.509 --> 40:52.222
We've got an F-3 sitting here
on the ground. A beauty!

40:52.472 --> 40:54.224
Jo, it's Barn Burner!

40:54.474 --> 40:56.226
It won't hang out long!

40:56.476 --> 40:57.227
It's not hanging out.

40:57.477 --> 41:01.982
We got it! We see it!

41:06.486 --> 41:11.992
We're getting slammed in here.
You better hang back.

41:25.505 --> 41:30.010
- Is this thing loaded?
- Yeah, go for it.

41:30.510 --> 41:31.261
Rain bands.

41:31.511 --> 41:32.262
Look at the surf.

41:32.512 --> 41:37.017
Shit, horizontal rain! Hang on!

41:41.479 --> 41:44.232
Jesus, I've never seen
clutter like this.

41:44.482 --> 41:46.234
I don't think anyone has.

41:46.484 --> 41:50.989
Flash frequencies are high.

41:52.490 --> 41:56.995
We're in the core.

42:01.499 --> 42:02.250
We got sisters!

42:02.500 --> 42:06.004
Oh, my God.

42:06.504 --> 42:08.256
Julia, I can't talk now.

42:08.506 --> 42:11.259
- We're under the flanking line.
- I realise that.

42:11.509 --> 42:14.262
We can't attack from the south.
We'll get rolled.

42:14.512 --> 42:17.265
Watch me.

42:17.515 --> 42:25.023
I know you're upset. You just must
breathe. We both got to breathe.

42:28.485 --> 42:29.235
Cow.

42:29.486 --> 42:34.991
I must go, Julia! We got cows!

42:37.494 --> 42:39.245
Another cow!

42:39.496 --> 42:42.999
I think it was the same one.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.251
We got drunkards. We got no path!

42:45.502 --> 42:46.252
Get us out of here!

42:46.503 --> 42:51.007
- I'm trying!
- Floor it!

42:55.512 --> 42:59.015
Look out!

43:09.526 --> 43:14.030
Oh, God! Oh, God!

43:40.515 --> 43:43.268
See that carousel? Did you see?

43:43.518 --> 43:48.022
It was incredible.

43:53.528 --> 43:58.032
Oh, honey-honey-

44:02.537 --> 44:03.288
Did you see that?

44:03.538 --> 44:07.292
It's all right. Come on, it's okay.

44:07.542 --> 44:13.047
No, I'm not okay. This is not okay.

44:14.549 --> 44:17.260
Oh, Christ, I'm sorry.

44:17.510 --> 44:19.262
Honey, I didn't think.

44:19.512 --> 44:23.266
When you used to tell me
that you chased tornados...

44:23.516 --> 44:28.271
...deep down I always
thought it was a metaphor.

44:28.521 --> 44:30.273
It's okay. It's okay.

44:30.523 --> 44:34.277
Three times a lady!
Did you see the inflow jets?

44:34.527 --> 44:37.280
See?! I was in the middle of it!

44:37.530 --> 44:41.284
I'm thinking it might not
be too bad of an idea...

44:41.534 --> 44:44.287
...if we left, because there
was too many tornados there.

44:44.537 --> 44:49.292
Are you kidding? This thing's not over.
We've only seen the start.

44:49.542 --> 44:50.293
You know...

44:50.543 --> 44:53.296
...we're close to Wakita.

44:53.546 --> 44:56.299
Aunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop.

44:56.549 --> 44:58.301
We crave sustenance.

44:58.551 --> 45:02.305
Guys, we are not invading my aunt.

45:02.555 --> 45:03.306
Food.

45:03.556 --> 45:06.267
Food.

45:06.517 --> 45:12.023
We're absolutely not going.

45:21.532 --> 45:23.284
There's the spot. Just do it.

45:23.534 --> 45:27.038
Great.

45:37.548 --> 45:41.302
Come on, honey.

45:41.552 --> 45:42.303
Come on.

45:42.553 --> 45:46.307
You must meet her, she's great.
Meg, how are you?

45:46.557 --> 45:49.310
- How are you?
- It is so good to see you!

45:49.560 --> 45:50.311
You too.

45:50.561 --> 45:52.313
The other day I told Jo...

45:52.563 --> 45:54.315
...how much I miss you.

45:54.565 --> 45:57.276
You haven't seen my new work.

45:57.527 --> 45:59.278
Oh, honey.

45:59.529 --> 46:01.280
You've seen some action.

46:01.531 --> 46:03.282
You should've seen it.

46:03.533 --> 46:04.325
Boys!

46:04.575 --> 46:08.079
Give me some loving!

46:14.544 --> 46:18.297
In a lightning storm, grab your
ankles and stick your butt up.

46:18.548 --> 46:21.300
It's the safest orifice to get hit.

46:21.551 --> 46:23.302
I'd like to get hit, see what it's like.

46:23.553 --> 46:26.305
Real lemonade. Meg, I'm moving in!

46:26.556 --> 46:31.060
Look out. Make a space.

46:38.568 --> 46:42.071
Look out.

46:43.573 --> 46:45.324
God, you got a lot of beef.

46:45.575 --> 46:48.327
- Where'd you get this beef?
- Did you see my cows?

46:48.578 --> 46:52.081
No.

46:53.583 --> 46:54.333
Cool.

46:54.584 --> 46:55.334
You slaughter them.

46:55.543 --> 46:58.296
Nice. Potatoes.

46:58.546 --> 47:00.298
Grab it now.

47:00.548 --> 47:07.054
Meg's gravy is famous.
It's practically a food group.

47:07.555 --> 47:09.307
Shower's free.

47:09.557 --> 47:13.060
I'm next.

47:14.562 --> 47:17.315
I want that.

47:17.565 --> 47:20.318
How can you watch this garbage?

47:20.568 --> 47:24.322
Pardon me. You must see this.

47:24.572 --> 47:27.325
Like for you to be out
there chasing tornados?

47:27.575 --> 47:29.327
It's a thrill.

47:29.577 --> 47:32.330
Man vs. nature. Battling the elements.

47:32.580 --> 47:34.332
What a weasel.

47:34.582 --> 47:38.336
As a scientist, can you
actually predict tornados now?

47:38.586 --> 47:40.338
No, they're unpredictable...

47:40.588 --> 47:43.341
...as my unfortunate
colleagues found out today.

47:43.591 --> 47:47.345
But we hope to change all that
with a system I have devised.

47:47.595 --> 47:49.347
God, he sucks.

47:49.597 --> 47:50.348
Shut up!

47:50.598 --> 47:52.350
Turn him off.

47:52.600 --> 47:53.351
What a wiener.

47:53.601 --> 47:57.313
He's so in love with himself.
I thought it was a summer thing.

47:57.563 --> 47:59.315
He'll rue the day.

47:59.565 --> 48:02.318
He'll rue the day he came
up against The Extreme.

48:02.568 --> 48:04.320
- Hear, hear.
- Amen, baby.

48:04.570 --> 48:07.323
Bill, I'm talking imminent rue-age.

48:07.573 --> 48:10.326
Imminent rue-age.

48:10.576 --> 48:14.330
I was just wondering, why do
you call Billy "The Extreme"?

48:14.580 --> 48:17.333
'Cause Billy is The Extreme.

48:17.583 --> 48:21.337
Bill's the most out-of-controllest
bastard in the game.

48:21.587 --> 48:25.341
No, I think I came in second.

48:25.591 --> 48:26.342
I've seen him in high gear.

48:26.592 --> 48:29.345
You guys must get new stories.

48:29.595 --> 48:30.346
I'll go clean up.

48:30.596 --> 48:32.306
So...

48:32.556 --> 48:34.308
...we get this one near Daleton.

48:34.558 --> 48:35.309
God!

48:35.559 --> 48:38.354
We're close and Jo's got the VID on it.

48:38.604 --> 48:40.356
She's filming it.

48:40.606 --> 48:45.361
Suddenly, this shitty-looking green
Valiant pulls up right in the way.

48:45.611 --> 48:47.363
She starts yelling and this...

48:47.571 --> 48:52.326
...loser stumbles out of the car.
He's got a bottle of Jack Daniels.

48:52.576 --> 48:53.327
He's naked.

48:53.577 --> 48:55.329
He's butt-naked.

48:55.579 --> 48:57.331
Not naked.

48:57.581 --> 49:00.334
I was not naked!

49:00.584 --> 49:02.336
He's without apparel.

49:02.586 --> 49:03.337
Half-naked.

49:03.587 --> 49:09.343
Naked. So, Jo's yelling at him
to get out of the way, right?

49:09.593 --> 49:11.345
So...

49:11.595 --> 49:14.348
...he just strolls up to the twister...

49:14.598 --> 49:16.350
...and says, "Have a drink!"

49:16.600 --> 49:19.353
And he chucks the bottle
into the twister and...

49:19.603 --> 49:21.355
...it never hits the ground.

49:21.605 --> 49:24.358
Twister caught it, sucked it right up.

49:24.608 --> 49:27.361
Honey, this is a tissue of lies.

49:27.611 --> 49:29.363
There was another Bill...

49:29.613 --> 49:30.364
...an evil Bill...

49:30.614 --> 49:32.366
...and I killed him.

49:32.616 --> 49:36.078
I love him!

49:46.589 --> 49:49.341
That was a good-size twister.
What was that? An F-3?

49:49.592 --> 49:50.342
F-2.

49:50.593 --> 49:52.344
I'm lost again.

49:52.595 --> 49:56.348
It's the Fujita scale. It measures a
tornado's intensity by how much it eats.

49:56.599 --> 49:57.349
Eats?

49:57.600 --> 49:59.351
Destroys.

49:59.602 --> 50:02.354
That encounter we had was
a strong F-2, F-3, maybe.

50:02.605 --> 50:05.357
We'll see F-4's today.

50:05.608 --> 50:06.358
That'd be sweet.

50:06.609 --> 50:11.363
Four is good. Four would
relocate your house efficiently.

50:11.614 --> 50:16.118
Is there an F-5?

50:16.619 --> 50:19.371
What would that be like?

50:19.622 --> 50:24.126
The finger of God.

50:25.628 --> 50:30.090
None of you has seen an F-5?

50:30.591 --> 50:34.094
Just one of us.

50:43.604 --> 50:45.356
Forget it.

50:45.606 --> 50:47.358
Doesn't matter what you do...

50:47.608 --> 50:49.360
...you'll still be beautiful.

50:49.610 --> 50:51.362
You're biased.

50:51.612 --> 50:54.365
Yes, I am.

50:54.615 --> 50:56.367
Sounds like old times.

50:56.617 --> 51:00.120
Yes, it does.

51:00.621 --> 51:03.374
He didn't keep his part of the bargain.

51:03.624 --> 51:05.376
Which part?

51:05.626 --> 51:10.381
To spend his life pining for you
and die miserable and alone.

51:10.631 --> 51:15.135
That so much to ask?

51:17.638 --> 51:20.391
I don't know.

51:20.641 --> 51:26.355
Bill always went his own way,
usually the same way you were going.

51:26.605 --> 51:30.359
Seems like a long time ago.

51:30.609 --> 51:34.113
Not so long, Jo.

51:34.613 --> 51:39.118
He's here, isn't he?

51:40.619 --> 51:45.124
That is so beautiful.

51:45.624 --> 51:48.377
We got one!

51:48.627 --> 51:51.380
F-3, mile outside of Parlaine!

51:51.630 --> 51:56.385
This is for Garfield county,
including the city of Enid.

51:56.635 --> 51:59.388
This storm has developed
in the last 15 minutes.

51:59.638 --> 52:04.393
Doppler radar shows that
this is an intense storm.

52:04.643 --> 52:05.394
Ride with Dusty, okay?

52:05.644 --> 52:07.396
- What's SELS say?
- Big!

52:07.646 --> 52:08.397
Let's go!

52:08.647 --> 52:10.399
Where's Jonas?

52:10.649 --> 52:12.401
- He's in Milston.
-30 miles away.

52:12.651 --> 52:14.361
- Can we beat him?
- I'm working on it.

52:14.611 --> 52:15.362
Thanks for stopping by.

52:15.612 --> 52:17.364
Sorry to eat and run.

52:17.614 --> 52:20.367
It's what you live for.

52:20.617 --> 52:21.368
Good to see you.

52:21.618 --> 52:23.370
It's okay.

52:23.620 --> 52:25.372
Tasty cow, Aunt Meg.

52:25.622 --> 52:26.373
It's for you.

52:26.623 --> 52:27.374
Thank you.

52:27.624 --> 52:29.376
You and me, right?

52:29.626 --> 52:30.377
Sweet.

52:30.627 --> 52:32.379
Sweet.

52:32.629 --> 52:33.380
Nice meeting you.

52:33.630 --> 52:38.135
Likewise. You better run.

52:39.636 --> 52:40.387
Keys.

52:40.637 --> 52:44.391
Please. You're welcome.

52:44.641 --> 52:48.145
Hang on.

52:48.645 --> 52:49.396
We'll go through town.

52:49.646 --> 52:54.401
We'll take Meyers Road past the fire
station, then 132 to the 44 east.

52:54.651 --> 52:59.156
If there's shortcuts, let us know.

53:30.646 --> 53:34.399
Rabbit, time to impress me.

53:34.650 --> 53:41.156
A mile up there's a little detour.
We'll walk in the woods.

53:56.672 --> 54:00.384
It gets bumpy here, folks.

54:00.634 --> 54:04.137
Let's get you wired.

54:09.643 --> 54:14.147
Excuse me.

54:16.650 --> 54:21.154
Okay, you're on.

54:25.659 --> 54:28.412
An ordinary person spends his life...

54:28.662 --> 54:30.414
...avoiding tense situations.

54:30.664 --> 54:32.416
Repo Man spends his life...

54:32.666 --> 54:38.171
...getting into tense
situations, Beltzer!

54:42.676 --> 54:44.428
What do you got?

54:44.678 --> 54:47.431
Turn left here toward that farm.

54:47.681 --> 54:50.434
You sure?

54:50.684 --> 54:54.396
Trust me. Rabbit is good.
Rabbit is wise.

54:54.646 --> 54:56.398
- Mother of God.
- Jesus Christ.

54:56.648 --> 54:58.400
This is a field.

54:58.650 --> 55:01.403
I know. Keep going beyond it,
through that brush.

55:01.653 --> 55:04.406
See that brush right in front of you?

55:04.656 --> 55:06.408
Yes, we see it. What's beyond that?

55:06.658 --> 55:07.409
Beyond what?

55:07.659 --> 55:08.410
Beyond what?

55:08.660 --> 55:13.415
The brush! A brick wall,
a bearded lady, what?

55:13.665 --> 55:18.170
It's the highway!

55:18.670 --> 55:19.421
Where's the road?

55:19.671 --> 55:21.423
Where's the road?

55:21.673 --> 55:25.177
It should be any moment.

55:31.683 --> 55:33.435
Hello.

55:33.685 --> 55:34.436
Shit.

55:34.686 --> 55:36.438
She's insane.

55:36.688 --> 55:39.441
You're insane.
You trying to kill someone?

55:39.691 --> 55:40.442
Really?

55:40.692 --> 55:44.404
It was nice of you to see 10
people on the road and not stop!

55:44.654 --> 55:48.408
Very good. Let's keep
this channel clear.

55:48.658 --> 55:53.163
Dirt bag.

56:00.086 --> 56:02.839
We have to get off this road.

56:03.089 --> 56:03.840
Don't guess.

56:04.090 --> 56:06.843
I'm not. Make a right turn.

56:07.093 --> 56:07.844
Want to drive?

56:08.094 --> 56:11.598
Just turn!

56:16.102 --> 56:19.606
Do we follow?

56:21.107 --> 56:24.611
We do not.

56:28.073 --> 56:30.825
What's he doing?

56:31.076 --> 56:32.827
I don't know.

56:33.078 --> 56:39.584
Find this road. It's like Bob's road.

56:41.086 --> 56:42.837
Touchdown!

56:43.088 --> 56:44.839
We have touchdown.
Tornado is on the ground.

56:45.090 --> 56:46.841
Listen to this.

56:47.092 --> 56:48.843
It's coming down Route 33.

56:49.094 --> 56:50.845
We're on 33.

56:51.096 --> 56:52.847
What's the path?

56:53.098 --> 56:55.850
It's going about 35 miles an hour.

56:56.101 --> 56:57.811
- Do you see this?
- I can't.

56:58.061 --> 56:59.813
Where is it? Hello.

57:00.063 --> 57:01.815
Where're you looking?

57:02.065 --> 57:03.817
- Where?
- Direction, Rabbit.

57:04.067 --> 57:04.818
North-northeast.

57:05.068 --> 57:05.819
See it?

57:06.069 --> 57:07.821
Got anything?

57:08.071 --> 57:08.822
North-northeast, do you copy?

57:09.072 --> 57:10.824
It's coming right at us.

57:11.074 --> 57:14.828
Axis's gone vertical.
Sucker's really gaining strength.

57:15.078 --> 57:16.830
Do you see it?

57:17.080 --> 57:19.833
No.

57:20.083 --> 57:24.838
We don't have a visual! Repeat!
We don't have a visual! Help us out!

57:25.088 --> 57:25.839
Where is it?

57:26.089 --> 57:28.842
I got it. It's the best
motion I've ever seen.

57:29.092 --> 57:33.596
The base of this fatty's over 1/2 mile.

57:34.097 --> 57:38.852
If you're going east on 7, it's coming
over the hill in a few minutes.

57:39.102 --> 57:40.854
This is the one. I feel it.

57:41.104 --> 57:42.856
It must be there.

57:43.106 --> 57:45.859
Maybe it stalled.

57:46.109 --> 57:47.861
No, I think Rabbit's right.

57:48.111 --> 57:51.865
It's going to show its ugly
face right over that hill.

57:52.115 --> 57:53.867
What do you think?

57:54.117 --> 57:58.580
You going for it?

58:00.081 --> 58:02.834
Time for deployment.

58:03.084 --> 58:09.591
Oh, man. This is the
fun part, sweetheart.

58:19.100 --> 58:19.851
We got hail.

58:20.101 --> 58:24.606
Hail. We got hail.

58:27.108 --> 58:28.860
Pull over.

58:29.110 --> 58:30.820
That's good.

58:31.070 --> 58:34.574
We got a big one!

58:36.075 --> 58:37.827
Upflow, Beltzer! We have upflow.
Copy.

58:38.077 --> 58:40.830
I'm checking it.

58:41.080 --> 58:44.834
I'm checking. She's almost up.

58:45.084 --> 58:46.836
Now, this is it.

58:47.086 --> 58:51.591
I'll get her ready.

58:59.098 --> 59:00.850
You see them?

59:01.100 --> 59:01.851
You see them?

59:02.101 --> 59:03.853
The red truck went toward the core!

59:04.103 --> 59:08.608
Is he talking about Billy?

59:09.108 --> 59:10.860
Are you okay?!

59:11.110 --> 59:14.614
Yes! Keep going!

59:25.124 --> 59:26.834
Beltzer, we got a view!

59:27.085 --> 59:28.836
I see it!

59:29.087 --> 59:30.838
Okay, I got it!

59:31.089 --> 59:36.594
That's no moon! It's a space station!

59:39.097 --> 59:42.600
We have debris!

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.833
They're in the bear cage!

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:08.835
Oh, my God!

01:00:09.085 --> 01:00:09.836
Oh, my God!

01:00:10.086 --> 01:00:11.838
Look at this!

01:00:12.088 --> 01:00:13.840
Take a peek!

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:16.843
You can really feel it
with a telephoto lens!

01:00:17.093 --> 01:00:18.845
What's wrong?

01:00:19.095 --> 01:00:19.846
What's wrong?

01:00:20.096 --> 01:00:22.849
You people are crazy, do you know that?

01:00:23.099 --> 01:00:25.852
Are you set up? We're not
leaving till we get this.

01:00:26.102 --> 01:00:30.606
And she's the craziest one of them all!

01:00:41.117 --> 01:00:43.870
Okay, she's almost ready!

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:44.871
Hold on!

01:00:45.121 --> 01:00:50.626
We're almost there! We're almost there!

01:00:55.131 --> 01:00:56.883
This is fine!

01:00:57.133 --> 01:00:57.884
No, a little closer!

01:00:58.134 --> 01:01:01.596
A little closer!

01:01:03.097 --> 01:01:06.601
Close enough.

01:01:11.105 --> 01:01:14.859
Hurry! Get the tailgate!

01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:16.861
You got it?

01:01:17.111 --> 01:01:19.864
She's set. Help me get her down.

01:01:20.114 --> 01:01:20.865
Hurry!

01:01:21.115 --> 01:01:25.620
Let's go!

01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:28.873
Hurry!

01:01:29.123 --> 01:01:30.875
Damn! We got to go!

01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:32.877
We can do it!

01:01:33.127 --> 01:01:36.631
- Come on!
- It's stuck.

01:01:54.106 --> 01:01:54.857
Look out!

01:01:55.107 --> 01:01:58.611
Come on! Hurry!

01:02:09.121 --> 01:02:10.873
Where'd it go?

01:02:11.123 --> 01:02:12.875
Where is it?

01:02:13.125 --> 01:02:14.877
What's going on?

01:02:15.127 --> 01:02:17.880
I don't believe this.

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:18.881
What the hell!

01:02:19.131 --> 01:02:23.636
What's the Doppler say?

01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:28.641
The cone of silence.

01:02:36.107 --> 01:02:37.858
Bill, Jo, it's over.

01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:40.861
The thing was stable and then it...

01:02:41.112 --> 01:02:42.863
It's gone.

01:02:43.114 --> 01:02:46.867
- It's backbuilding!
- It's not through yet.

01:02:47.118 --> 01:02:49.870
You're right. It's backbuilding.

01:02:50.121 --> 01:02:51.872
We got a jumper!

01:02:52.123 --> 01:02:53.874
It's backbuilding! Track it!

01:02:54.125 --> 01:02:56.877
Yeah, Jo! Data's incomplete!

01:02:57.128 --> 01:03:00.881
You guys should get out!

01:03:01.132 --> 01:03:02.883
Bill, help! Help me!

01:03:03.134 --> 01:03:04.885
We should leave.

01:03:05.136 --> 01:03:06.887
- Forget the sensors!
- Help me!

01:03:07.138 --> 01:03:08.889
We must get out of here now!

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.891
Beltzer'll see if it drops!

01:03:11.142 --> 01:03:16.856
It's not going to drop anywhere
near us! It'll drop on us!

01:03:17.106 --> 01:03:19.859
We can still do this! Wait!

01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:21.861
Go back!

01:03:22.111 --> 01:03:23.863
Forget it! Forget it!

01:03:24.113 --> 01:03:29.618
Go back! It's not too late!

01:03:32.121 --> 01:03:34.874
- Go back!
- Forget it! It's too late!

01:03:35.124 --> 01:03:36.876
Help me!

01:03:37.126 --> 01:03:38.878
Help me!

01:03:39.128 --> 01:03:40.880
What're you doing?

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:42.882
The pack's wasted! It's over!

01:03:43.132 --> 01:03:45.885
What's wrong? We can still do this!

01:03:46.135 --> 01:03:47.887
Listen to you! You're obsessed!

01:03:48.137 --> 01:03:49.889
You've never seen what it can do!

01:03:50.139 --> 01:03:52.892
- I just saw it!
- You've never seen it!

01:03:53.142 --> 01:03:58.898
You've never seen it miss this house,
miss that house and come after you.

01:03:59.148 --> 01:04:03.903
Christ, Jo, is that
what you think it did?

01:04:04.153 --> 01:04:05.905
You don't know.

01:04:06.155 --> 01:04:07.907
Why can't you forget it?!

01:04:08.157 --> 01:04:10.910
You don't understand.
You'll never know.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.870
When's it going to be enough?

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.875
How close do you have to get?!
Talk to me! Jo, things go wrong!

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:21.879
You can't explain it!
You can't predict it!

01:04:22.129 --> 01:04:25.883
Killing yourself won't
bring your dad back.

01:04:26.133 --> 01:04:28.886
I'm sorry he died.
But it was a long time ago.

01:04:29.136 --> 01:04:31.889
You've got to move on.

01:04:32.139 --> 01:04:35.893
Stop living in the past and look
at what's right in front of you.

01:04:36.143 --> 01:04:37.895
What're you saying?

01:04:38.145 --> 01:04:41.649
Me, Jo.

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:29.655
You better come here and look at this.

01:05:30.155 --> 01:05:33.909
Velocities are maxed out.
Those two cells converge...

01:05:34.159 --> 01:05:39.665
Inbounds and outbounds have doubled.

01:07:03.165 --> 01:07:05.918
There have been tornado sightings.

01:07:06.168 --> 01:07:10.923
The latest reported just to the
north-east of Canton a few minutes ago.

01:07:11.173 --> 01:07:14.927
Wait a second. I've just been handed
this-. This is official now.

01:07:15.177 --> 01:07:21.683
A tornado has been reported moving
through Canton a few minutes ago.

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:34.655
Can I have 8 coffees to go, please?

01:08:16.154 --> 01:08:18.657
Two coffees.

01:08:20.158 --> 01:08:23.662
Long day.

01:08:27.165 --> 01:08:29.917
I've been thinking about the sensors.

01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:34.923
The way they scattered out
there today on the highway.

01:08:35.173 --> 01:08:36.925
I'm starting to wonder...

01:08:37.175 --> 01:08:40.929
...if the funnel'll carry them.

01:08:41.179 --> 01:08:42.930
Too light?

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.934
I don't know. Maybe the
whole thing's too light.

01:08:46.184 --> 01:08:50.689
What can we do?

01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:53.942
I'm not sure.

01:08:54.192 --> 01:08:56.903
This is a very dangerous situation.

01:08:57.154 --> 01:09:00.907
If you have loved ones in the
area do not try to help them.

01:09:01.158 --> 01:09:05.662
You'll only be a hindrance to them.

01:09:06.162 --> 01:09:09.666
Thank you.

01:10:20.195 --> 01:10:25.659
Shit. Jesus, it's coming.

01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:32.916
It's coming! It's headed right for us!

01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:34.918
It's already here.

01:10:35.168 --> 01:10:38.672
Everybody, underground!

01:10:44.177 --> 01:10:47.681
Honey!

01:10:48.181 --> 01:10:51.685
Come on!

01:11:13.164 --> 01:11:17.669
Jo, come on!

01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:19.921
Get underground!

01:11:20.171 --> 01:11:24.676
Take cover, now!

01:11:34.185 --> 01:11:35.937
Close the doors!

01:11:36.187 --> 01:11:40.692
Doors! Doors!

01:11:47.198 --> 01:11:49.951
Come on!

01:11:50.201 --> 01:11:51.953
Come back!

01:11:52.203 --> 01:11:52.954
Take my hand!

01:11:53.204 --> 01:11:55.915
Take my hand!

01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:59.919
Come on, hurry!

01:12:00.170 --> 01:12:04.924
Come on! Get in here! Get in here!

01:12:05.175 --> 01:12:09.679
Go, go, go! Come on!

01:12:12.182 --> 01:12:13.933
Everyone down in the pit!

01:12:14.184 --> 01:12:14.934
Get down!

01:12:15.185 --> 01:12:17.937
Everybody down!

01:12:18.188 --> 01:12:22.692
Move!

01:12:48.176 --> 01:12:51.679
Stay calm!

01:13:08.196 --> 01:13:12.700
I got it.

01:13:24.212 --> 01:13:24.963
It's okay!

01:13:25.213 --> 01:13:26.923
My head.

01:13:27.173 --> 01:13:28.925
You're okay.

01:13:29.175 --> 01:13:31.928
- It's not okay!
- It'll be over soon!

01:13:32.178 --> 01:13:33.930
This is insane!

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.932
Stay calm!

01:13:36.182 --> 01:13:41.688
This is driving me crazy!
I don't want to do this!

01:14:12.177 --> 01:14:17.682
It's okay, honey.
It's going to be okay.

01:14:29.193 --> 01:14:31.946
Chewed my lips off wondering
if he was coming back home.

01:14:32.196 --> 01:14:34.949
I've never been so
frightened in my life.

01:14:35.199 --> 01:14:35.950
Was I on key?

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:36.951
You were.

01:14:37.201 --> 01:14:41.706
Wow, that's a wonder.

01:15:24.207 --> 01:15:29.712
Look at the truck. It's trashed.

01:15:39.222 --> 01:15:42.934
Of course, tornado activity continues.

01:15:43.184 --> 01:15:46.938
Reports from Fairview indicate
a drive-in was blown away.

01:15:47.188 --> 01:15:49.982
We know there's injuries
and the damage is massive.

01:15:50.191 --> 01:15:52.944
Is that what it was like up on the hill?

01:15:53.194 --> 01:15:54.946
That? No.

01:15:55.196 --> 01:15:56.948
We were lucky.

01:15:57.198 --> 01:16:01.953
Those were just downdrafts
and microbursts.

01:16:02.203 --> 01:16:05.957
The tornado just sideswiped us.

01:16:06.207 --> 01:16:08.960
Which way is it headed?

01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:13.714
It's banking north-east.

01:16:16.217 --> 01:16:20.721
It looks to hit Wakita.

01:16:26.227 --> 01:16:28.980
I'm going. I'm going. Let's go.

01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:29.981
We're going!

01:16:30.231 --> 01:16:31.983
Get me a route around the storm.

01:16:32.191 --> 01:16:33.985
Light up! Let's go!

01:16:34.235 --> 01:16:34.986
Wait!

01:16:35.236 --> 01:16:35.945
Where's the phone?

01:16:36.195 --> 01:16:38.948
- The lines are down.
- I'm going.

01:16:39.198 --> 01:16:40.950
Damn it.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:41.951
I'll drive.

01:16:42.201 --> 01:16:46.956
We can jump on the 38 exchange
and cross Highway 132.

01:16:47.206 --> 01:16:48.958
Honey, it's Meg. I got to go.

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:50.960
I'm going back.

01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:52.962
Good. You'll be safe at the motel.

01:16:53.212 --> 01:16:55.965
See you in the morning.

01:16:56.215 --> 01:16:58.968
I won't be there.

01:16:59.218 --> 01:17:00.970
What?

01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:02.972
Why?

01:17:03.222 --> 01:17:04.974
What do you mean?

01:17:05.224 --> 01:17:07.977
I'm saying good-bye.

01:17:08.227 --> 01:17:11.981
You know what?
I can't compete with this.

01:17:12.231 --> 01:17:13.941
I don't know where to start.

01:17:14.192 --> 01:17:15.985
Don't do this now.

01:17:16.194 --> 01:17:21.741
Sooner or later it would have ended.
We both know that.

01:17:22.241 --> 01:17:25.953
The funny thing is...

01:17:26.204 --> 01:17:27.955
...I'm not that upset.

01:17:28.206 --> 01:17:30.958
What does that mean?

01:17:31.209 --> 01:17:35.713
We can do it! Come on! Let's move!

01:17:37.215 --> 01:17:38.966
I didn't mean it to happen.

01:17:39.217 --> 01:17:40.968
Billy, I know.

01:17:41.218 --> 01:17:43.971
It's okay.

01:17:44.221 --> 01:17:47.725
Come on.

01:17:48.225 --> 01:17:49.977
You go ahead.

01:17:50.227 --> 01:17:52.980
She needs you.

01:17:53.230 --> 01:17:55.983
I hope Aunt Meg's okay.

01:17:56.192 --> 01:17:57.985
What about you?

01:17:58.235 --> 01:17:59.987
Don't worry about me.

01:18:00.237 --> 01:18:04.742
I know my way home.

01:18:06.243 --> 01:18:08.996
We can be to Wakita in an hour.

01:18:09.205 --> 01:18:12.708
Come on.

01:18:25.221 --> 01:18:29.725
Oh, my God.

01:18:37.233 --> 01:18:40.736
They had no warning.

01:19:12.226 --> 01:19:15.730
Jo, wait!

01:19:22.236 --> 01:19:25.739
Wait!

01:19:30.244 --> 01:19:34.707
Careful, this house could go any second.

01:19:40.254 --> 01:19:43.757
Take a flashlight.

01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:50.723
This whole place is ready to go.

01:19:53.225 --> 01:19:57.730
Careful.

01:20:02.234 --> 01:20:04.987
Did you hear that?

01:20:05.237 --> 01:20:09.742
- I heard something.
- Easy.

01:20:12.244 --> 01:20:15.748
Careful.

01:20:27.218 --> 01:20:28.969
She's down here!

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:34.725
Meg, we're here! We're coming down!

01:20:37.228 --> 01:20:38.979
Get this off her.

01:20:39.230 --> 01:20:39.980
Hang on.

01:20:40.231 --> 01:20:41.982
Don't move.

01:20:42.233 --> 01:20:42.983
- Ready?
- Watch your head.

01:20:43.234 --> 01:20:43.984
Go.

01:20:44.235 --> 01:20:45.986
Go.

01:20:46.237 --> 01:20:47.988
I got it.

01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:49.990
Easy. Are you okay?

01:20:50.241 --> 01:20:54.745
No, I'm all right. I'm fine.

01:20:55.246 --> 01:20:59.750
Oh, God.

01:21:03.253 --> 01:21:04.004
Hurry.

01:21:04.254 --> 01:21:08.759
- Let's go.
- Can you walk?

01:21:09.259 --> 01:21:11.762
Watch out!

01:21:22.231 --> 01:21:23.983
Joey, take my watch.

01:21:24.233 --> 01:21:27.736
Go. Careful.

01:21:28.237 --> 01:21:29.989
We're coming out!

01:21:30.239 --> 01:21:30.990
Get an ambulance!

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.993
Get an ambulance! Move it! Now!
Go!

01:21:34.243 --> 01:21:37.746
Give me the lamp.

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:44.003
How about steak and eggs?

01:21:44.253 --> 01:21:48.007
- How nice you all came over.
- There you go.

01:21:48.257 --> 01:21:51.760
Nice and slow.

01:22:00.227 --> 01:22:03.981
Easy, easy.

01:22:04.231 --> 01:22:07.985
Grab Mose for me! I think
he's a little shaken up.

01:22:08.235 --> 01:22:12.740
Don't worry, I'll get him!

01:22:14.241 --> 01:22:15.993
Is she okay?

01:22:16.243 --> 01:22:17.995
We'll probably keep her overnight.

01:22:18.245 --> 01:22:18.996
Forget it.

01:22:19.246 --> 01:22:21.999
- I'm all right.
- You're going to the hospital.

01:22:22.249 --> 01:22:25.002
Okay, I'll go. But I'm
going to drive myself.

01:22:25.252 --> 01:22:29.757
Your car's in a tree around the corner.

01:22:31.258 --> 01:22:32.009
It's okay.

01:22:32.259 --> 01:22:35.763
It's okay.

01:22:46.273 --> 01:22:49.026
The F-4 that hit Wakita has
now moved to the Northeast.

01:22:49.276 --> 01:22:54.031
I've just gotten word in that an even
stronger tornado has started to form...

01:22:54.281 --> 01:22:58.994
...25 miles south where the two
storms met and combined forces.

01:22:59.244 --> 01:23:01.997
Weather Service says this is unusual.

01:23:02.247 --> 01:23:05.000
Oh, my God.

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:09.004
Look at this. Here, look at this.

01:23:09.254 --> 01:23:13.008
We're talking about winds in
excess of 300 miles an hour.

01:23:13.258 --> 01:23:14.009
What're you doing?

01:23:14.259 --> 01:23:17.012
I want to see how you are. How is she?

01:23:17.262 --> 01:23:21.767
I was worried about you.

01:23:22.267 --> 01:23:25.979
- Look at this.
- It's nothing.

01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:30.984
He says I have a bump on the
head and maybe a broken wrist.

01:23:31.235 --> 01:23:31.985
Let me see that.

01:23:32.236 --> 01:23:36.990
There's nothing to see.
It doesn't hurt.

01:23:37.241 --> 01:23:39.993
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

01:23:40.244 --> 01:23:44.998
Stop blaming yourself.
You got me out of the house.

01:23:45.249 --> 01:23:47.000
It's got to stop.

01:23:47.251 --> 01:23:49.002
I didn't have any warning.

01:23:49.253 --> 01:23:56.760
The sirens went off a few seconds before
it hit. I didn't get downstairs.

01:23:57.261 --> 01:24:00.013
I'm sorry.

01:24:00.264 --> 01:24:03.016
I was listening to the
radio and... I mean...

01:24:03.267 --> 01:24:05.018
You may not want to know,
but it's happening.

01:24:05.269 --> 01:24:10.774
N.S.S.L's predicting an F-5.

01:24:12.276 --> 01:24:15.028
It's going to happen to someone else.

01:24:15.279 --> 01:24:18.031
You go stop it.

01:24:18.282 --> 01:24:21.034
I don't know how.

01:24:21.285 --> 01:24:24.037
I think you do.

01:24:24.288 --> 01:24:29.001
You've been chasing these things
since you were a little kid.

01:24:29.251 --> 01:24:30.002
It's what you do.

01:24:30.252 --> 01:24:34.756
Go. Do it.

01:24:54.276 --> 01:24:56.987
You all right?

01:24:57.237 --> 01:25:01.742
I thought you were going with Meg.

01:25:03.243 --> 01:25:07.789
What is it?

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:13.003
What is it?

01:25:13.253 --> 01:25:17.758
I know how to make Dorothy fly.

01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:32.022
Of course.

01:25:32.272 --> 01:25:34.024
Of course.

01:25:34.274 --> 01:25:37.027
I need every aluminium can you can find.

01:25:37.277 --> 01:25:39.029
We need cutters and duct tape.

01:25:39.279 --> 01:25:46.036
I want to get the last Dorothy on the
back of my truck. Both of them, now.

01:25:46.286 --> 01:25:49.790
We're gone!

01:26:52.269 --> 01:26:54.020
Are you ready?

01:26:54.271 --> 01:26:57.023
We're good.

01:26:57.274 --> 01:26:59.025
We're good? Good.

01:26:59.276 --> 01:27:02.779
We're very good.

01:27:08.285 --> 01:27:10.036
Let's go! Come on!

01:27:10.287 --> 01:27:13.039
- You get them done?
- I think so.

01:27:13.290 --> 01:27:16.793
Beautiful.

01:27:28.263 --> 01:27:29.014
Good?

01:27:29.264 --> 01:27:31.016
Great job. Be ready to record.

01:27:31.266 --> 01:27:33.018
Ready?

01:27:33.268 --> 01:27:34.019
Be careful.

01:27:34.269 --> 01:27:36.021
Don't follow too close.

01:27:36.271 --> 01:27:39.774
You got it, boss!

01:27:43.278 --> 01:27:47.782
We're back in business.

01:27:49.284 --> 01:27:53.788
Come on, let's go.

01:27:54.289 --> 01:27:56.041
Half a mile more?

01:27:56.291 --> 01:27:59.044
Sounds right.

01:27:59.294 --> 01:28:01.046
I'll put her in the road.

01:28:01.296 --> 01:28:04.049
Won't someone hit it?

01:28:04.257 --> 01:28:08.762
Nobody'll be there.

01:28:18.271 --> 01:28:20.023
Hurry!

01:28:20.273 --> 01:28:22.776
Let's go.

01:28:29.282 --> 01:28:32.035
Okay, that's good!

01:28:32.285 --> 01:28:36.790
- Got it?
- Let's go!

01:28:39.292 --> 01:28:41.044
You in position?

01:28:41.294 --> 01:28:44.798
Ready for contact!

01:28:51.304 --> 01:28:53.056
This is it.

01:28:53.306 --> 01:28:56.059
It'll work.

01:28:56.309 --> 01:28:57.060
Just another minute.

01:28:57.268 --> 01:29:01.773
We're ready!

01:29:16.287 --> 01:29:18.039
Come on, come on, take her!

01:29:18.289 --> 01:29:19.040
Too light.

01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:22.794
No, it's not.

01:29:24.295 --> 01:29:28.800
- We're losing it.
- No, she can still fly.

01:29:39.269 --> 01:29:42.772
Get in!

01:29:52.282 --> 01:29:56.035
Oh, my God!

01:29:56.286 --> 01:29:59.789
Get us off this thing!

01:30:03.293 --> 01:30:06.796
Hurry!

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:14.804
What is that?

01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:21.060
What is that?

01:30:21.311 --> 01:30:24.063
Hurry!

01:30:24.314 --> 01:30:27.817
Hurry!

01:30:28.318 --> 01:30:31.821
This is not good!

01:30:38.286 --> 01:30:40.788
Hurry!

01:30:53.301 --> 01:30:56.804
Go!

01:31:17.283 --> 01:31:20.036
Son-of-a-bitch!

01:31:20.286 --> 01:31:22.038
Jo, Bill, you all right?

01:31:22.288 --> 01:31:24.040
Can you guys hear me?

01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:26.042
We're okay.

01:31:26.292 --> 01:31:30.046
Jo, Bill, did you see that explosion?

01:31:30.296 --> 01:31:34.801
We saw it.

01:31:35.301 --> 01:31:38.054
This monster's moving north-east on 80!

01:31:38.304 --> 01:31:39.055
Copy?!

01:31:39.305 --> 01:31:41.057
This is it.

01:31:41.307 --> 01:31:43.059
Last one.

01:31:43.309 --> 01:31:46.062
Last time.

01:31:46.312 --> 01:31:49.065
Mobile lab to Mobile One.
Ground speed is increasing.

01:31:49.315 --> 01:31:52.068
The base is a mile wide.
We can't see it anymore.

01:31:52.318 --> 01:31:53.069
What's your location?

01:31:53.319 --> 01:31:58.074
I am right alongside her!
She's beautiful!

01:31:58.324 --> 01:32:03.830
We're ready to play, so pull
back and prepare to monitor.

01:32:06.332 --> 01:32:08.084
They had to be somewhere.

01:32:08.334 --> 01:32:11.087
Path is stable, copy that.

01:32:11.337 --> 01:32:12.046
Men...

01:32:12.296 --> 01:32:14.048
...this is it.

01:32:14.298 --> 01:32:16.050
Stay sharp back there.

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:20.054
They have position.

01:32:20.304 --> 01:32:23.057
They could make it.

01:32:23.307 --> 01:32:28.813
Not unless they anchor the pack.

01:32:30.314 --> 01:32:32.066
Jonas, can you hear me?

01:32:32.316 --> 01:32:34.068
Not now.

01:32:34.318 --> 01:32:37.071
Jonas, listen to me.
The pack is too light.

01:32:37.321 --> 01:32:40.074
The twister'll toss it. Anchor it.

01:32:40.324 --> 01:32:43.077
Sharing valuable information, Jo.

01:32:43.327 --> 01:32:44.078
I'll consider that. Thanks.

01:32:44.328 --> 01:32:46.080
Listen to me!

01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:48.082
What?

01:32:48.332 --> 01:32:50.042
Can you see them?

01:32:50.293 --> 01:32:51.043
Jonas, what's your position?

01:32:51.294 --> 01:32:53.045
Howdy, Bill.

01:32:53.296 --> 01:32:55.047
We're heading north-east, parallel...

01:32:55.298 --> 01:32:58.050
...about to pull off
ahead of it on the left.

01:32:58.301 --> 01:33:01.053
Hang back a minute. We got
a good view from back here.

01:33:01.304 --> 01:33:05.057
She could shift or track and if
she does, she'll come right at you.

01:33:05.308 --> 01:33:08.060
Let's do that. He'd never
put us in harm's way.

01:33:08.311 --> 01:33:11.063
When I want your opinion, I'll give it.

01:33:11.314 --> 01:33:14.066
Shut up, put your foot on
the gas, and stay on course.

01:33:14.317 --> 01:33:15.067
It's unbelievable!

01:33:15.318 --> 01:33:16.068
What's wrong?

01:33:16.319 --> 01:33:19.071
The base is so huge!
It must be at least a mile wide!

01:33:19.322 --> 01:33:21.073
Do you copy?

01:33:21.324 --> 01:33:22.074
Listen to me!

01:33:22.325 --> 01:33:24.076
Get off this frequency!

01:33:24.327 --> 01:33:26.078
She's shifting.

01:33:26.329 --> 01:33:30.082
Oh, my God.

01:33:30.333 --> 01:33:32.084
Jonas, I'm telling you!

01:33:32.335 --> 01:33:35.087
Eddie, I know you can hear me!

01:33:35.338 --> 01:33:38.841
Get out!

01:33:44.347 --> 01:33:47.808
Look out!

01:34:14.335 --> 01:34:16.087
Damn!

01:34:16.337 --> 01:34:19.090
Stupid!

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:21.092
We tried.

01:34:21.342 --> 01:34:25.805
We can do nothing.

01:34:27.306 --> 01:34:31.060
- Yes, we can.
- Ground speed is increasing.

01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:36.816
Get ahead of it quickly,
or she'll bury you.

01:34:57.336 --> 01:34:59.088
We have debris!

01:34:59.338 --> 01:35:02.842
Right!

01:35:04.343 --> 01:35:07.847
Right!

01:35:08.347 --> 01:35:10.850
Left!

01:35:12.351 --> 01:35:16.105
- What now?
- I have no idea.

01:35:16.355 --> 01:35:19.108
You still with us?

01:35:19.358 --> 01:35:21.110
Oh, my God.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:25.823
I think we're going in.

01:35:42.339 --> 01:35:44.091
Maybe we should get off this road.

01:35:44.341 --> 01:35:46.093
You may be right.

01:35:46.343 --> 01:35:49.096
Are you okay?

01:35:49.346 --> 01:35:50.097
You set up?

01:35:50.347 --> 01:35:53.100
- We're set. You going in?
- We are.

01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:55.060
- You ready?
- I'm on it.

01:35:55.311 --> 01:35:58.814
Be careful.

01:36:10.326 --> 01:36:13.829
She's up.

01:36:19.335 --> 01:36:20.085
Where are they?

01:36:20.336 --> 01:36:25.090
Doppler tracking is great!
Wind speed increasing!

01:36:25.341 --> 01:36:29.845
I've never seen anything like this.

01:36:31.347 --> 01:36:34.850
They're going to punch the core.

01:36:45.361 --> 01:36:48.113
Ready?

01:36:48.364 --> 01:36:51.116
Let me set the cruise control.

01:36:51.367 --> 01:36:53.118
We're good.

01:36:53.369 --> 01:36:55.079
On three?

01:36:55.329 --> 01:36:58.832
On three.

01:37:00.334 --> 01:37:03.837
Go!

01:37:11.345 --> 01:37:12.096
Ready?

01:37:12.346 --> 01:37:14.098
Ready.

01:37:14.348 --> 01:37:15.099
One!

01:37:15.349 --> 01:37:16.100
Two!

01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:19.853
Three!

01:37:30.322 --> 01:37:32.074
Go...

01:37:32.324 --> 01:37:33.075
...go...

01:37:33.325 --> 01:37:37.830
...go! Go!

01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:00.102
Dorothy's flying!

01:38:00.352 --> 01:38:02.104
She's flying!

01:38:02.354 --> 01:38:03.105
Look!

01:38:03.355 --> 01:38:04.106
We're in!

01:38:04.356 --> 01:38:07.109
I don't believe it! We're in!

01:38:07.359 --> 01:38:09.111
We'll be very popular!

01:38:09.361 --> 01:38:11.113
- She's flying!
- Look at that!

01:38:11.363 --> 01:38:14.116
It's beautiful. It's working.
It's Christmas time.

01:38:14.366 --> 01:38:16.118
We're inside! It's working!

01:38:16.368 --> 01:38:19.121
- Dorothy did it!
- I'm getting readings!

01:38:19.371 --> 01:38:22.124
This is it! We did it, man!

01:38:22.374 --> 01:38:25.836
We just made history.

01:38:26.336 --> 01:38:30.841
You guys, it's about to shift north-east.

01:38:32.342 --> 01:38:35.095
You should get out of there!
Do you copy?

01:38:35.345 --> 01:38:39.850
Do you copy?

01:38:43.353 --> 01:38:46.857
Run!

01:39:19.348 --> 01:39:23.852
The barn! Come on!

01:39:24.353 --> 01:39:27.856
Look out!

01:39:33.362 --> 01:39:34.112
Here!

01:39:34.363 --> 01:39:38.867
Go! Hurry!

01:39:40.369 --> 01:39:44.873
To the barn!

01:39:54.383 --> 01:39:57.844
Stay down!

01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:06.103
My God! Who are these people?

01:40:06.353 --> 01:40:09.856
I don't think so.

01:40:11.358 --> 01:40:14.861
Quick!

01:40:25.372 --> 01:40:28.125
Oh, my God!

01:40:28.375 --> 01:40:31.837
Come on!

01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:39.845
Run for it!

01:40:59.364 --> 01:41:02.868
Get down!

01:41:03.368 --> 01:41:07.873
Come on!

01:41:34.357 --> 01:41:35.108
Here!

01:41:35.358 --> 01:41:42.866
These pipes go down at least 30 feet.
We anchor to it, we may have a chance!

01:41:44.367 --> 01:41:46.119
No good!

01:41:46.369 --> 01:41:49.873
This!

01:41:50.373 --> 01:41:54.878
Get in!

01:42:05.347 --> 01:42:08.850
Hold on!

01:42:31.373 --> 01:42:34.876
Hang on!

01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:16.895
- You all right?
- Are you?

01:44:25.403 --> 01:44:28.156
Look at that.

01:44:28.406 --> 01:44:32.911
It didn't take the house.

01:44:38.374 --> 01:44:40.126
We did it.

01:44:40.376 --> 01:44:41.127
Yeah, we did.

01:44:41.377 --> 01:44:43.129
Dorothy really flew.

01:44:43.379 --> 01:44:47.884
It was a good idea.

01:44:49.385 --> 01:44:53.139
We've got so much to do.

01:44:53.389 --> 01:44:55.141
I'll get grant approval
for a warning system.

01:44:55.391 --> 01:44:58.144
We need a bigger lab.
You must start analysing data.

01:44:58.394 --> 01:45:00.146
I do?

01:45:00.396 --> 01:45:04.150
We must generate models of the
data, and I must run the lab.

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.152
You do the analysis, I'll run the lab.

01:45:06.402 --> 01:45:11.908
You're running the lab?
I don't think so.

01:45:14.410 --> 01:45:19.123
Do you always have to
do things the hard way?

01:45:19.374 --> 01:45:24.128
We got it, guys! The sensors worked!
The computers went crazy! We got data!

01:45:24.379 --> 01:45:27.131
It's the biggest twister on record!

01:45:27.382 --> 01:45:31.135
Check out that sky.

01:45:31.386 --> 01:45:34.138
You know what?
I think we've seen enough.
