Sometime between transfer
and intake at Iron Heights,

00:55.097 --> 00:57.339
- an inmate caught James unaware.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.639
By the time the guards intervened,

00:58.725 --> 01:00.216
- it was too late.
- Motive?

01:00.310 --> 01:02.347
The inmate was a headcase off his meds.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.144
For all we know, he thought
he was killing his mother.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.439
Well, the random murder
of Cayden James...

01:08.235 --> 01:10.898
- It doesn't feel very random.
- It was bad timing,

01:11.363 --> 01:13.821
and even worse luck, Mr. Mayor.
That's all.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.032

but we've got a problem.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.004
Cayden James' Corto Maltese
bank account has been withdrawn.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.590
What do you mean, "it's been withdrawn"?

03:37.676 --> 03:40.464
It's empty. All 70 million.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.088
Somebody took all the funds out
before we got access.

03:43.682 --> 03:47.392
- Do we have any idea who?
- No. But I do have three guesses.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.434
I put in a request
for the withdrawal log,

03:49.688 --> 03:51.224

it had to do with the budget.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.640
Is it true they might have to
close the schools?

to make sure that doesn't happen.

There's actually something that I
needed to speak with Felicity about.

- Hmm.
- Someone emptied the account.

Anatoly, Diaz or Laurel.

that we haven't seen yet.

through official channels.

with Corto Maltese.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.516
Someone killing Cayden
right as the money goes missing?

05:14.606 --> 05:16.893
Could be the same person that
framed you for Cayden's son's murder.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.144
Could be.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.184
The only thing
that I know for sure right now

05:20.278 --> 05:21.860
is that if I don't get that money
in 48 hours,

05:21.947 --> 05:24.030

their intel with us.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.132
Not that we were sharing any with them.

to keep us looped in.

the Cayden James bank situation.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.762
Any clue we get can lead us
to the scum who worked with them.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.514
Scum singular or scum plural?

05:54.354 --> 05:55.890
And yes, that is me bringing up

05:55.981 --> 05:57.563
exactly what's going on
between you and Laurel.

Well, we're not
braiding each other's hair, Curtis.

then we'll deal with Dinah.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.218
You're not going to believe it.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.847
The bank just sent over
the withdrawal log we requested,

06:34.936 --> 06:36.802
plus security footage.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.388
That is unbelievable.

06:38.607 --> 06:39.723
What are we seeing?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.352

as "Siu Jerg Jai."</i>

I'm guessing Felicity
had something to do with this.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.912
Yeah, she did.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.460
Thank you for inserting yourself
into this, by the way.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.758
Yeah, sure. Well, you never would've
shared the information otherwise.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.051
No, I wouldn't have.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.844
Because I don't trust you
to do the right thing.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.719
And what is that, politely ask Laurel
to give back the money?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.015
Not kill her.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.260
Dinah...

07:19.064 --> 07:21.226
I understand that you're hurting.
I get it.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.316
I also understand that
I don't have the most credibility

07:24.402 --> 07:27.190
when it comes to telling people
not to commit murder.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.356
But the city is on the verge
of economic collapse,

07:30.450 --> 07:32.316
and we just found the key
to fixing that.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.703
Laurel is never giving you that money.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.622
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, I actually do.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.325
Because I know that
when you look at her,

07:42.337 --> 07:43.919
you see the Laurel that you lost.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.414
And that's why
you'll never be able to do

07:46.508 --> 07:48.090
what's necessary to get that money back.

You're someplace nobody can find you.

I guess we now know
what happened to $70 million.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.023
Right. If we find her, then we find it.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.365
(CLEARS THROAT) Quentin, I know that
we have been over this,

08:58.455 --> 09:01.869
but just for accuracy, you were
the last person that saw her.

Yeah. Well, I...
You know, I didn't see her exactly.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.538
- Right.
- Like I told you,

09:05.628 --> 09:09.542
Dinah got off a shot just as Laurel
knocked us both out with her cry.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.255
(SIGHS) And, uh, yeah, when I came to,
Laurel was gone.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.593
So, are we even sure that Dinah hit her?

09:15.680 --> 09:18.093
No. She didn't leave a definitive
blood trail at the scene.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.175
We can go back over it
with chemical analysis,

09:20.268 --> 09:22.385
- see if we missed anything
- Yeah, yeah, we can do that.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.889
Listen, actually there is
something I should tell you.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.397
Um, while Cayden James
was holding the city hostage,

09:31.112 --> 09:32.648
Laurel started following me.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.151
All right? It was right after
James kidnapped me.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.735
And so, uh, well, you know,
I caught up with her.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.952
I tried to make a connection.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.581
Well, I mean, after what we just
saw her do to Dinah's boyfriend...

09:44.751 --> 09:46.538
Are we even sure that that worked?

09:46.628 --> 09:48.164
OLIVER: Actually, it might have.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.414
When we went through
her go-bag at the scene, there was...

09:51.716 --> 09:56.177
There was a photo in there of you
and our Laurel.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.886
I gave her that picture.

09:58.681 --> 10:03.346
(SCOFFS) Anyway... My point
being, if she hasn't skipped town yet,

10:03.978 --> 10:06.516
maybe she'll come try to find me,
make a connection, you know,

10:06.606 --> 10:09.599
- say goodbye or something.
- I mean, it's a long shot, but...

10:09.692 --> 10:12.560
I agree, but I also don't think
that we can afford to be picky, so...

10:12.654 --> 10:13.815
I'll get home.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.192
I'll make it easy for her to,
you know, get me alone.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.070
If she shows up, just make sure
that you stall long enough

10:19.160 --> 10:20.241
for John and I to get there.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.861
Yeah, sure. Bye.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.205
Well, do you need me
to go with you for backup?

10:25.416 --> 10:28.784
No, no. You know, like I said
it's a long shot. Right?

10:29.796 --> 10:32.504
So, your time is probably better
spent here at the office.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.419
But thank you.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.881
Okay, well, call if you need anything.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.344
We've already been over this spot
a thousand times.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.767
Yeah, which is exactly why
I brought my new toy.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.394
Presenting...

10:47.814 --> 10:50.557
Mr. Terrific's
Supersonic Spectrograph.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.434
It uses Earth-2 sonic frequencies

10:53.528 --> 10:56.646
emitted from Black Siren
and combines them with light imaging

10:56.739 --> 10:58.526
to create a holographic replication

10:58.616 --> 11:01.074
of her position
during that night's events.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.828
- Is that...
- Laurel.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.364
Is she crawling?

11:08.918 --> 11:11.581
No. She was dragged.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.716
Looks like she wasn't
putting up much of a fight.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.965
- Your bullet must have tagged her, D.
- Good.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.672
Now we just have to find her

11:22.765 --> 11:24.472
before the others do something stupid.

11:24.893 --> 11:25.883
Stupid how?

11:25.977 --> 11:27.718
Oliver is not seeing clearly on this.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.313
He's desperate to get that money.
He'll believe anything Laurel says.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.515
Shouldn't we also
be desperate for that money?

11:33.776 --> 11:35.688
- The city's hurting.
- I know.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.899
But there are more effective ways

11:37.989 --> 11:39.400
to find out
where she's keeping that money.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.899
Sounds like
you're talking about torture.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.326
And it sounds like
you wanna go soft on her.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.822
Curtis, the only way
to get justice for Vince

11:48.208 --> 11:50.871
and money for the city
is going to be messy.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.868
WILD DOG:
Hey, guys, look at this.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.494
Tire tracks.

11:55.006 --> 11:58.170
If they're from whoever
dragged her off, could be something.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.839
Let's make sure they didn't
leave anything else behind.

12:08.311 --> 12:12.806
I picked this up at a noodle shop
my girls used to love.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.771
I've never been to any noodle shop.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.236
(SIGHS) Well, hot and sour's
the best thing for healing

12:19.322 --> 12:20.688
no matter what Earth you're from.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.945
You know, I think I might have
a picture here of the three of us.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.151
Would you stop?

12:25.453 --> 12:26.864
I've already told you,

12:26.955 --> 12:30.323
there's nothing inside of me
to change or going to change.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.708
(QUENTIN EXHALES)

12:36.089 --> 12:37.296
Um...

12:37.882 --> 12:39.214
You know, you, uh...

12:40.134 --> 12:41.500
You let me go.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.174
Instead of killing me,
like James wanted.

12:45.723 --> 12:50.218
You hesitated killing Vincent Sobel...

12:50.311 --> 12:52.052
Before doing exactly that.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.393
Yeah.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.724
You've done
some pretty unspeakable things.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.316
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.024
(SIGHS)

13:06.703 --> 13:07.784
Huh?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.247
Basically, you grew up without a father.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.460
My guess, you spent your whole life
looking for one.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.829
Zoom.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.173
Adrian Chase.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.921
Cayden James.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.504
All those men are gone now.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.548
Including Cayden James,
he was killed last night.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.935
Well, it looks like I have an opening
for a new domineering father figure.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.270
Feel free to send in your application.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.985
You don't need anybody else telling
you what to do with your life.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.147
Interesting.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.567
Coming from someone
who has me locked up in a cabin

13:47.660 --> 13:48.946
in the middle of nowhere.

13:49.287 --> 13:50.744
You're welcome to leave anytime.

13:53.791 --> 13:57.284
But, my, you know, my guess is that

13:58.379 --> 13:59.995
it's been a long time

14:01.424 --> 14:04.337
since you had a chance to decide
what you want your life to be.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.220
So, I figured I'd give you
a little time and space

14:09.599 --> 14:10.931
to do just that.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.300
I've got my hopes for sure.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.020
But you're the one
that has to want to change.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.608
It's weird.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.984
I actually really like
hot and sour soup.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.190
(LAUGHS)

14:28.326 --> 14:30.784
Maybe we have more things in common
than I thought.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.996
Would you tell me more
about your Laurel?

14:43.841 --> 14:46.504
Well, the luminol's certainly
doing its work on this blood trail.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.257
JOHN: <i>Yeah, so much blood, we shouldn't
need the luminol to see it.</i>

14:49.430 --> 14:50.921
Someone cleaned this place up.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.348
Yeah, because Laurel
lost too much blood to do it herself.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.051
What, so someone helped her get away?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.726
No, someone took her.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.566
I don't want to believe it, but I can.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.777
We have to find her before
they do something irreversible.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.695
If they haven't already.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.657
- How has the print gotten us nowhere?
- We're not nowhere.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.332
We've already ruled out
all the known vehicles

15:19.419 --> 15:21.001
in the SCPD criminal database.

15:21.879 --> 15:24.292
Which just leaves us with
millions of other unknown vehicles.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.672
- Otherwise, known as "nowhere."
- (CURTIS SIGHS)

15:27.218 --> 15:29.505
Rene is right. This lead is exhausted.

15:31.556 --> 15:32.637
RENE: What the hell?

15:34.392 --> 15:35.428
GREEN ARROW: Where is she?

15:36.394 --> 15:37.851
We know you have Black Siren.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.520
If she dies, you've destroyed the city!

15:40.606 --> 15:42.643
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We do not have Black Siren.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.099
We'll figure that out for ourselves.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.809
Since when is our word not enough?

15:46.028 --> 15:47.485
Since you tried to kill her.

15:48.614 --> 15:52.324
If she dies, that money is lost forever.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.325
"Lost forever." Like Vincent Sobel.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.574
Where was the Green Arrow
when he needed saving?

15:59.667 --> 16:01.909
Your team walked into a trap.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.412
If you came with us,
Vincent might still be alive.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.212
Don't you dare say his name.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.586
Thermal imaging is only showing
our six heat signatures inside.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.258
I mean, if Laurel's here, she's...

16:11.429 --> 16:12.419
She's not warm.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.971
Are you hacking us?
Don't hack us, Felicity!

16:15.057 --> 16:17.014
I'm not hacking. I wouldn't hack...

16:18.269 --> 16:20.636
Yeah, technically I'm hacking you.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.847
- Wouldn't be your first time.
- GREEN ARROW: No, it wouldn't.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.190
She's tracked all of you before.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.945
Because we needed to know
if one of you broke our trust.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.613
One of you did.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.527
You have already
punished Rene for that mistake.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.823
It's just too bad he doesn't
look like Laurel Lance, Oliver,

16:40.958 --> 16:43.871
because if he did, you would
probably forgive him for murder.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.586
Guys, we're not actually about to
fight about this, are we?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.004
Like, physically fight?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.833
Keep your team in line, Curtis,
and we won't have to find out.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.503
Hold on! You guys barged
into another's team bunker!

16:54.597 --> 16:56.259

Hey, hey, hey, hey, guys, no.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.886
I do think Oliver wants to fight.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.021
'Cause that's how
you always solve your problems.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.898
That doesn't make you a hero.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.193
It makes you a thug.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.238
And it's a real shame,

because he's gonna feel
so betrayed when he figures it out.

- Don't move.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.259

- Do it.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.265
So, this was your plan all along, huh?

17:41.852 --> 17:43.718
To get the chance
to look through our bunker?

17:44.188 --> 17:46.271
And you wonder why we can't trust you.

to wonder anymore.

hope to God you're not there too.

but what you really mean is "for."

Also, I borrowed
a piece of your tech, Curtis.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.433
What did you do?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.518
You didn't really think
I wanted Oliver to hit me.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.361
Would you care to share
with the rest of the class?

18:35.489 --> 18:37.856
I planted one of Curtis'
audio chips on Oliver.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.780
So, if they get the drop on Laurel...

18:41.829 --> 18:43.115

you were lying about something.

(SOFTLY) Okay, but why didn't
you tell me?

19:48.396 --> 19:49.682
I thought we were in on this together.

I didn't wanna put you in a position
where you had to lie to Oliver, okay?

But listen, this is the right thing.

But you got to go
before she wakes up, please.

Okay, fine. But did you at least
find out where the money is?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.614
Well, I'm building up to that.

Look, I know how important she
and this whole thing is to you.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.284
<i>from that nasty little
songbird friend of yours.</i>

21:38.130 --> 21:39.211
Fine.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.920
Speedy, text me the address.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.680
That was easier than expected.

21:49.934 --> 21:53.427
Oliver's willing to burn Vince, but
he'll let that murdering bitch go.

21:53.604 --> 21:54.594
You were right, D.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.230
Oliver just took Laurel at her word.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.770
The city's not getting
its money back that way.

22:00.361 --> 22:01.568
It's up to us.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.440
Can you track the bug?

22:04.365 --> 22:05.446
You know I can.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.240
Then let's suit up.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.990
Six miles out. Head west.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.622
Felicity, you might wanna make sure
your seat belt is on.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.173
Yeah. It looks good.

22:23.384 --> 22:25.171
- Why?
- We got a tail.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.637
We're marked!

Oh!

22:45.489 --> 22:47.071
- You think it's the others?
- Has to be.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.318
How did they find us?

22:51.328 --> 22:53.115
- Oh, my...
- What?

22:54.832 --> 22:55.948
This.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.703
Rene wanted me to hit him.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.333
It doesn't matter now,
they're in our dust.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.505
Can you keep them there?

23:05.050 --> 23:07.167
You forgot what you hired me for
six years ago.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.718
FELICITY: You know,
that was exhilarating.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.880
It was Alanis Morissette-level ironic.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.297
But exhilarating.

(DOOR OPENS)

23:25.905 --> 23:27.316
(QUENTIN CLEARS THROAT)

23:28.908 --> 23:29.989
Hello, Ollie.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.275
Where's the money?

23:31.368 --> 23:33.576
(SIGHS) Haven't we gone
through this already?

23:34.121 --> 23:36.909
No money until
I am safely out of this country.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.165
You are in no position to make demands.

23:39.710 --> 23:44.626
I can think of 70 million different
reasons why you're wrong about that.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.830
Okay.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.170
Oliver, Oliver, please, please.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.260
Listen, Dinah's just got her scared,
all right? And for good...

23:51.680 --> 23:52.841
Good reason.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.097
Laurel needs our protection.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.098
Which is why
you should let me go with you.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.684
I'll make sure you get
out of the country safely,

24:02.024 --> 24:03.560
and then we can start your new life.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.734
- Together.
- Quentin, that's insane.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.652
Well, well, well...

24:09.031 --> 24:10.488
That was quite the performance,

24:10.574 --> 24:13.317
but now that I know that it was
only about the money, hard pass.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.527
Actually, Thea had it right earlier.

24:15.621 --> 24:19.035
I was more focused on getting
through to you than the money.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.411
But I believe

24:20.834 --> 24:24.874
that if you'd had someone
in your world to support you

24:25.297 --> 24:26.788
when things got bad,

24:27.758 --> 24:29.124
you wouldn't be a criminal.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.256
This is our chance
to find out if I'm right.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.258
If after a while you decide
that you don't want me there,

24:39.561 --> 24:40.597
I'll leave.

24:40.896 --> 24:41.886
Promise.

24:43.273 --> 24:44.980
This time around,
everything's down to you.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.153

somewhere tropical.

GREEN ARROW: Quentin.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.870
The minute
that she is out of the country,

24:59.081 --> 25:01.414
you get added to
the list of people she's killed.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.585
I'm betting otherwise.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.041
And you trust her enough

25:09.008 --> 25:12.547
to risk yourself? To risk the city?
Tell me now.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.223
I do.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.973
Then so do I.

25:31.113 --> 25:35.198
That's it. I am not sitting here
on the side of the road like trash

25:35.451 --> 25:37.534
while they let that murderer go free!

25:37.619 --> 25:39.155
Guys, we're gonna find them.

25:39.246 --> 25:42.785
How? They tossed away our bug
like it was a bug.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.411
I think I know a way.

25:46.128 --> 25:47.209
But it's gonna hurt John.

25:47.296 --> 25:48.912
You say that like it's a deal breaker.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.376
That guy's the whole reason
I got shot, hoss.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.584
Curtis, this is not the time
to be worrying about John's feelings.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.720
No, I mean, really hurt John.

25:58.515 --> 25:59.722
Physically.

26:01.185 --> 26:02.551
Find them.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.639
Whatever it takes.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.648
Well, the union rep's deadline
is coming up soon.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.647
Three-and-a-half hours
to be depressingly exact.

26:11.737 --> 26:12.773
Don't worry. We'll be gone

26:12.863 --> 26:14.855
and the money will be back
in the city coffers by then.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.155
It better be.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.282
Your new cover identities
are almost done.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.318
You have a one-way ticket
on a private plane

26:20.412 --> 26:22.529
to your father-daughter trip
of a lifetime.

26:22.623 --> 26:25.832
Just keep that vengeful bird of yours
from finding me.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.038
(SCREAMS)

26:28.378 --> 26:30.040
John? It's his arm.

26:30.464 --> 26:31.580
The implant, it's been disabled.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.505
Someone's hacking it remotely
to broadcast our location.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.209
It's not "someone." It's Curtis.
They know where we are.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.340
- Can you fix John?
- FELICITY: Rebooting the chip now.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.881
It's gonna be a while
before you have full functionality.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.387
You're going to be dealing with
your post-injury symptoms for a bit.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.476
I'm aware.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.895
- How long do we have?
- Based on the amount of time

26:47.981 --> 26:50.189
that's passed since we last lost them
and now that they've attacked John,

26:50.400 --> 26:51.390
not long.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.023
I'm sorry, but with the other team
that angry, that close,

26:54.113 --> 26:55.604
I can't protect Laurel by myself.

26:55.697 --> 26:56.687
You don't have to.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.398
Wait, are you gonna fight your old team?

26:58.492 --> 26:59.482
This is insane.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.661
Let's get ready to move.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.618
You're gonna turn right in a mile,
dirt road.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.832
You got us back on track, Mr. T.

27:11.922 --> 27:14.039
(CHUCKLES) I pity those fools now.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.669
Do they know that
we know where they are?

27:15.759 --> 27:17.500
Trust me, they know.

27:19.513 --> 27:20.754
Here's the turn.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.140
Listen...

27:25.644 --> 27:27.010
Laurel is a meta.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.055
Now, I know that people
protecting her were our friends,

27:30.440 --> 27:33.774
but if you hold back, if any of us
hold back our punches here,

27:33.861 --> 27:35.523
we are the ones who are gonna get hurt.

27:37.364 --> 27:40.448
And Laurel and the city's money
will both be gone. Understood?

27:43.871 --> 27:45.282
Sonic dampener arrow.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.531
Never thought Dinah would be the one
we'd use that against...

27:48.625 --> 27:49.866
Having second thoughts?

27:51.336 --> 27:52.872
Best-case scenario, man.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.542
Laurel avoids punishment
for what she's done.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.419
We put a hurtin' on the people
who used to be our friends.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.091
But we keep the city from dying.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.510
But at what cost?

28:01.388 --> 28:03.050
If the people going after her

28:03.140 --> 28:05.598
didn't look like Curtis,
Dinah, and Rene,

28:06.310 --> 28:07.972
would you even be asking this question?

28:08.061 --> 28:10.394
No.

28:12.816 --> 28:14.148
But I can't help but wonder,

28:15.819 --> 28:16.809
would we be doing this

28:16.904 --> 28:18.611
if the person they were after
didn't look like Laurel?

28:20.115 --> 28:22.698
Listen, man, I would back any call
you make, Oliver.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.658
Always have, always will.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.495
But we should acknowledge the fact

28:28.916 --> 28:32.375
that going after our former teammates
may be a line we can never uncross.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.585
I agree.

28:36.506 --> 28:37.997
But they crossed it first.

28:44.514 --> 28:47.382
Take the other car
to the main road and don't turn back.

28:47.684 --> 28:48.925
We'll stop the other team
from following.

28:49.019 --> 28:51.511
You'll have the city's money
in two hours. I promise.

Why not let me handle that?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.532
You know, it's a shame you can't scream.

29:12.626 --> 29:13.912
It almost makes this too easy.

29:14.002 --> 29:17.211
(SCOFFS) Oh, sweetie,
I don't have to scream to kill you.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.956
You are unbelievable.

29:20.050 --> 29:23.418
I cannot believe you did that.
You could've seriously hurt John!

29:23.512 --> 29:25.344

are really gonna hurt the city

29:25.430 --> 29:26.591

outcome, or even a good one,

34:39.619 --> 34:40.735
Any sign of Laurel?

34:41.161 --> 34:42.572
That trail has gone cold.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.495
I don't think that she'll be able
to get very far with her injuries.

34:48.753 --> 34:49.914
What about yours?

34:50.005 --> 34:51.291
Nothing Felicity can't fix.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.873
You know, I still can't believe
Curtis did this.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.501
I mean, messing with a chip in your
arm is totally crossing the line.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.257
It's our company's prototype.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.178
Obviously, injuring you
is way more of crossing of the line.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.217
Way more.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.099
Was not like
we didn't hurt them back.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.398
Has anyone heard about Rene?
I mean, he...

35:11.109 --> 35:12.441
He didn't look so good.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.314
He was shot five months ago.
The wound reopened.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.611
QUENTIN:
Well, we should go to the hospital.

35:16.698 --> 35:17.984
We gotta make sure he's okay.

35:18.074 --> 35:22.193
Unless anyone here has $70 million,
there won't be a hospital soon.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.495
Well, listen, Laurel is gonna call,
all right? She's gonna call.

35:24.581 --> 35:25.822
No, she's not.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.660
I know how much we all wish

35:32.005 --> 35:34.088
she was more like the Laurel
that we lost.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.126
But she's not.

35:43.433 --> 35:46.346
(SIGHS) We should get ready
to talk to the press.

35:46.436 --> 35:49.975
Quentin's right.
We should go and check on Rene.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.399
Please tell him that I'm sorry.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.570
- I screwed up, Thea.
- No, Quentin. You...

36:02.952 --> 36:06.195
You just believed in your daughter,
okay? That's not screwing up.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.411
And she is your daughter.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.538
In the only way that really matters.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.077
Yeah?

36:13.922 --> 36:15.379
And what way is that?

36:16.591 --> 36:18.207
In the eyes of her father.

36:28.812 --> 36:30.144
Any update?

36:30.355 --> 36:31.471
(SIGHS)

36:33.358 --> 36:34.474
Yeah.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.230
My bloodstream is about to
reach 90% coffee saturation.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.862
You know, I said that joke
hoping that you would laugh, but...

36:45.203 --> 36:49.413
Maybe now is not the best time
to be saying jokes, so I'll just...

36:51.084 --> 36:52.541
No updates on Rene.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.412
They've been working on him
for hours, huh?

36:56.965 --> 36:58.081
Yeah.

36:59.008 --> 37:00.249
But you know,

37:00.760 --> 37:02.877
Rene is the definition of stubbornness.

37:03.513 --> 37:07.097
No way is he gonna let Oliver
be the reason he goes down.

37:07.434 --> 37:08.641
Yeah.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.099
Dinah.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.269
This whole Laurel thing...

37:13.606 --> 37:14.847
It's not over.

37:16.025 --> 37:18.312
The second Rene is in the clear,

37:19.404 --> 37:22.738
we're gonna track her down,
and we are going to arrest her.

37:24.868 --> 37:27.360
We will get justice for Vince.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.116
Thank you for saying that.

37:31.750 --> 37:32.740
If it wasn't for you,

37:32.834 --> 37:35.292
I would have repaid Vince's death
with more violence.

37:37.547 --> 37:38.958
That isn't justice.

37:40.884 --> 37:44.002
I'm... I'm grateful to you,

37:44.304 --> 37:47.297
you know,
just for pulling me back, so...

37:48.057 --> 37:51.141
The speech worked
because I have faith in you, Dinah.

37:54.063 --> 37:56.476
I also had my T-Spheres programmed
as a plan B.

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

or lack thereof.

You don't need to be here, you know.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.912
If you're facing the firing squad,
I'm standing by your side.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.245
I don't know what to tell them.

38:16.461 --> 38:19.249
- It's not your fault, Ollie.
- I'm the Mayor, Speedy.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.420
I made a vow to protect Star City.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.465
And I'm sorry, but I didn't.
I couldn't...

38:28.515 --> 38:30.427
I swear that
I will make it up to them, but...

38:30.558 --> 38:32.140
Just that, okay, Ollie?

38:32.769 --> 38:34.055
You just tell them that.

38:50.578 --> 38:51.910
(CLEARS THROAT) I need to...

38:52.247 --> 38:54.990
I need to inform everyone
that the money

38:55.959 --> 38:58.201
extorted from us
by the cyberterrorist, Cayden James,

38:58.294 --> 38:59.410
has not been recovered.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.922
And to be honest with you,
I don't know that it ever will be.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.760
Now, I promised everyone that

39:08.388 --> 39:09.970
I would find the funds

39:10.056 --> 39:13.470
to keep the metro area running
without work stoppages, but...

39:15.895 --> 39:18.137
I'm so very sorry. As Mayor, I...

39:21.067 --> 39:22.729
I have failed this city.

<i>Now I know that your faith in me
is likely shaken, but my faith...</i>

You got a sec?

39:36.958 --> 39:39.325
My case against Queen is built on sand.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.919
It's only a matter of time before
Jean Loring figures that out.

39:42.005 --> 39:43.621
And why are you telling me that?

39:43.840 --> 39:45.627
I found something that could bury Queen.

39:46.843 --> 39:48.926
But I'll need the full backstop.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.212
All the SCPD's resources.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.218
I can see why Mr. Diaz likes you.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.431
The news isn't good.

40:01.691 --> 40:04.183
Mr. Ramirez suffered
a traumatic hemothorax.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.561
We were able to stop
the bleeding in his chest,

40:06.654 --> 40:08.816
but the injury also caused
his lung to re-collapse.

40:09.616 --> 40:12.029
Now, given the severity
of your friend's injuries,

40:12.118 --> 40:14.030
I'm recommending
he be transferred to a facility

40:14.120 --> 40:15.702
that can provide the care he needs.

40:15.788 --> 40:17.029
Outside of Star City.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.745
Mr. Ramirez is resting now.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.792
You and your friends
will have to wait to see him.

We thought Rene would be here.

Yeah. Yeah. How's Rene doing?

to ask that question.

- No.
