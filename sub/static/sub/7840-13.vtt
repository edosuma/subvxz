The Simpsons 18x13 (JABF07)
- Springfield Up -

00:02.319 --> 00:03.331
Oh, hello.

00:03.332 --> 00:06.254
I'm documentary filmmaker Declan Desmond.

00:06.255 --> 00:08.148
32 years ago I interviewed

00:08.150 --> 00:10.576
a group of Springfield schoolchildren.

00:14.910 --> 00:17.518
These children ran the gamut of society :

00:17.519 --> 00:18.611
rich and poor,

00:18.833 --> 00:19.967
black and white,

00:20.173 --> 00:21.742
"he'll grow into his looks"

00:21.947 --> 00:23.730
and "forever hideous."

00:24.204 --> 00:25.721
My dad was a circus freak,

00:25.723 --> 00:27.671
but my mom don't remember which one.

00:27.671 --> 00:30.109
I like to think it was a little bit of all of them.

00:30.169 --> 00:33.041
Every eight years, I revisited those children,

00:33.046 --> 00:36.221
creating a cinematic chronicle of their lives.

00:36.225 --> 00:39.061
Join me, won't you, to see dreams dissolve

00:39.066 --> 00:41.310
like a muffin in the rain in...

00:41.516 --> 00:43.560
Growing up Springfield

00:54.668 --> 00:57.531
What does the future hold for these children?

00:57.548 --> 01:00.212
Will he grow up to work in a robot factory?

01:00.218 --> 01:03.133
Will she be the receptionist for a robot businessman?

01:03.137 --> 01:06.642
And will he be a crusader for robo-sexual rights?

01:06.647 --> 01:10.153
I say, "yes," "no," and "yes."

01:10.238 --> 01:10.920
Whee!

01:15.678 --> 01:17.672
So, Lenny, what have we here?

01:17.678 --> 01:20.671
My daddy said I can have any birthday party I want.

01:20.675 --> 01:22.712
My cake will be a picture of a dinosaur

01:22.725 --> 01:24.082
and all the guests will say,

01:24.085 --> 01:26.170
"Why, Lenny, that's a fine cake!"

01:26.176 --> 01:27.622
Then, "Yes," I'll say.

01:29.147 --> 01:30.912
I decided not to waste any

01:30.916 --> 01:32.423
more film on him after that.

01:33.975 --> 01:35.472
I wish for world peace.

01:36.975 --> 01:38.853
I wish for world war.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.441
Oh, yeah, that would be cooler.

01:42.195 --> 01:43.533
I wish when I grow up,

01:43.538 --> 01:46.052
I'll be richer than everybody!

01:48.555 --> 01:49.882
I will! I will be rich!

01:49.887 --> 01:51.290
I'll own a football team and

01:51.298 --> 01:52.360
a basketball team

01:52.366 --> 01:54.161
and I'll make them play baseball!

01:55.415 --> 01:59.240
But what became of these wide-eyed na fs?

01:59.246 --> 02:01.422
Let's begin by following the life

02:01.428 --> 02:03.151
of little Clancy Wiggum.

02:04.287 --> 02:05.263
Bang-bang! Bang!

02:05.267 --> 02:06.901
Freeze, robber, freeze!

02:06.905 --> 02:07.911
Bang, bang, bang!

02:09.025 --> 02:11.203
It hurts! It hurts so bad!

02:11.207 --> 02:13.430
Please, just put one in my brain!

02:14.258 --> 02:14.852
Okay.

02:15.185 --> 02:16.053
Uh, bang.

02:16.697 --> 02:17.581
Thank you.

02:18.896 --> 02:21.642
As hall monitor, I am the law.

02:21.648 --> 02:22.620
No running in the hall.

02:22.627 --> 02:23.753
No running in the hall.

02:23.756 --> 02:25.243
Ah, no running in the hall.

02:25.247 --> 02:26.921
Hey, detention bird!

02:27.016 --> 02:28.660
Thanks for not running in the hall.

02:29.898 --> 02:30.860
Go, Wildcats.

02:35.776 --> 02:38.013
At 24, Clancy Wiggum

02:38.025 --> 02:40.421
was accepted into the police academy.

02:42.916 --> 02:43.381
Hmm...

02:45.925 --> 02:47.470
Wiggum!

02:47.475 --> 02:50.913
What did I tell you about pointsy-towardsies?!

02:50.917 --> 02:53.172
You seem a little cranky, Commandant.

02:53.188 --> 02:54.801
A back rub'll set you right.

02:54.805 --> 02:56.023
There we go.

02:56.128 --> 02:57.922
Woouh Ooh... okay.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.041
Don't be afraid to dig in there good!

03:03.347 --> 03:04.443
Hey, what's the matter, buddy?

03:04.607 --> 03:05.442
Need a backrub?

03:06.376 --> 03:08.420
At 32, Officer Wiggum

03:08.426 --> 03:11.401
had found the fast track to becoming chief.

03:11.667 --> 03:14.163
Oh, yeah, oh, that's the stuff.

03:14.167 --> 03:16.303
Thanks for giving me an 8:30 appointment.

03:16.307 --> 03:17.533
You are a lifesaver.

03:17.538 --> 03:21.933
Yo.....if I was Chief, I could give you 8:30 every day.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.463
I don't have the authority to...

03:23.477 --> 03:24.993
Oh... oh...

03:24.997 --> 03:26.362
I'll make it happen.

03:27.056 --> 03:29.203
And here we are in now-times.

03:29.207 --> 03:31.072
As you can see, I've gotten

03:31.076 --> 03:32.740
everything I've ever wanted.

03:32.968 --> 03:34.341
Except pants that fit.

03:34.837 --> 03:36.913
I told you that if I let you in this movie

03:36.916 --> 03:37.900
you couldn't make fun of me.

03:37.905 --> 03:38.941
I'm not making fun of you.

03:38.947 --> 03:40.232
I'm making fun of your pants.

03:40.236 --> 03:42.031
Well, how'd you like it if I made fun of your pants?

03:42.048 --> 03:42.662
Go ahead.

03:43.488 --> 03:45.020
Well, they're a little, uh...

03:45.088 --> 03:46.262
They-they, uh...

03:46.685 --> 03:47.720
Oh, they're perfect.

03:47.926 --> 03:50.852
When I grow up, I'll have a giant mansion,

03:50.857 --> 03:53.750
my own pinball machine with infinity quarters,

03:53.755 --> 03:56.581
eight pairs of peanut butter and jelly pajamas...

03:56.586 --> 03:58.071
How many wishes do I have left?

03:58.075 --> 03:59.693
None. You never had any.

03:59.696 --> 04:01.211
I'm not a genie.

04:01.217 --> 04:01.721
D'oh!

04:01.726 --> 04:04.662
Homer, your dreams will take a lot of money.

04:04.806 --> 04:06.253
Don't look at me. Look at the camera.

04:06.257 --> 04:06.731
Got it.

04:07.127 --> 04:08.221
I said, look at the camera.

04:08.228 --> 04:09.072
No problem.

04:09.086 --> 04:10.680
Now you're looking at a mud puddle.

04:10.718 --> 04:11.743
That's your hand.

04:11.747 --> 04:13.453
That's the production accountant.

04:13.456 --> 04:14.702
That's your other hand.

04:14.865 --> 04:16.762
Do you even know what a camera is?

04:16.767 --> 04:18.541
Well, of cour... No.

04:19.187 --> 04:21.173
I'm gonna put this squeaky toy

04:21.175 --> 04:23.012
on top of the camera.

04:24.127 --> 04:25.741
Squeaky! Squeaky!

04:25.746 --> 04:26.883
Squeaky, squeaky!

04:26.885 --> 04:28.342
Squeaky, squeaky, squeaky!

04:28.347 --> 04:30.963
Unsurprisingly, by age 24,

04:30.976 --> 04:34.421
Homer's dreams of wealth had not come to fruition.

04:34.425 --> 04:35.912
Manure for sale!

04:36.135 --> 04:37.733
Get your manure!

04:37.825 --> 04:39.760
Loamiest in town!

04:39.856 --> 04:41.233
Hey, the manure dealership

04:41.237 --> 04:43.413
is just one of the things I got going.

04:43.417 --> 04:47.502
I also have a sweet gig as an infomercial question-asker.

04:47.507 --> 04:51.450
Um, I know Super Clean cleans, but does it scrub?

04:53.727 --> 04:56.262
My garage band is getting so tight.

04:58.805 --> 05:01.022
Yeah, yeah, yeah

05:04.286 --> 05:07.112
The album cover's gonna be a naked girl

05:07.117 --> 05:09.133
with stars for boobs.

05:09.195 --> 05:11.931
And I do open-casket caricatures.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.282
Did he have any hobbies?

05:13.288 --> 05:14.583
Get out of here!

05:14.585 --> 05:17.073
But Homer had found a peanut of hope

05:17.078 --> 05:19.832
in his Cracker Jack box of despair.

05:22.216 --> 05:25.132
Homer is so amazing!

05:25.137 --> 05:26.812
He can chug a beer and

05:26.818 --> 05:29.342
pitch woo at the same time.

05:29.358 --> 05:30.933
The light from your eyes

05:30.936 --> 05:33.683
could guide a ship at sea.

05:34.055 --> 05:34.672
Eh?

05:34.977 --> 05:37.403
Are you two considering children?

05:37.867 --> 05:39.303
Kids? No way!

05:39.315 --> 05:41.980
You'll never see a couple of rugrats tying me down!

05:42.804 --> 05:43.951
You better not put this shot

05:43.953 --> 05:45.801
after the one where I said I won't have kids.

05:45.801 --> 05:48.119
That would be a devastating edit.

05:48.119 --> 05:50.813
Homer, your life is nothing to be ashamed of.

05:50.816 --> 05:52.143
You've got a loving family

05:52.148 --> 05:54.973
and a steady job at a nuclear power plant.

05:54.978 --> 05:56.442
You're not English Breakfast,

05:56.448 --> 05:58.981
but you're not Lapsang Soochong either.

06:00.718 --> 06:01.353
Oh, yeah?

06:01.367 --> 06:03.430
Check with me in eight years, Dr. Who.

06:03.437 --> 06:06.553
I'll be kickin' your ass with a solid gold boot!

06:06.858 --> 06:11.872
Hmm... what's changed for me since the last time I saw you?

06:11.916 --> 06:14.330
Only... everything!

06:14.338 --> 06:16.210
I can't believe it!

06:16.227 --> 06:19.363
Homer Simpson... a bloody millionaire?!

06:19.366 --> 06:20.861
Why do you sound so shocked?

06:20.868 --> 06:22.061
This is our fifth take.

06:26.097 --> 06:27.091
Whee!

06:29.175 --> 06:30.493
Now that I'm super-wealthy,

06:30.498 --> 06:32.832
I can buy them whatever their hearts desire.

06:33.787 --> 06:36.051
That's why rich kids turn out so well.

06:38.795 --> 06:40.442
Mine has a cup holder.

06:40.447 --> 06:42.451
Bart, that's a blowhole.

06:42.457 --> 06:43.590
You're a blowhole!

06:45.975 --> 06:47.801
No, boy. Up, up, up!

06:48.796 --> 06:51.232
Well, Marge, you must be proud of your "Homie."

06:51.238 --> 06:55.261
Oh, yes, I'm so proud, I feel my chest might burst.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.463
Can you edit that? I don't want to say "chest" in a movie.

06:58.465 --> 07:00.383
You said it and it stays.

07:00.386 --> 07:03.292
But I must know: How did Homer come so far

07:03.296 --> 07:04.800
in eight short years?

07:07.345 --> 07:09.702
This pays a lot better than you think.

07:10.107 --> 07:12.213
We pay him in limes

07:12.575 --> 07:14.380
That's right, limes.

07:16.247 --> 07:18.643
You see, Declan, I made my millions

07:18.645 --> 07:22.663
with a simple invention: the Condiment Pen!

07:22.667 --> 07:24.173
Just click the buttons at the top,

07:24.186 --> 07:27.332
and you can choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo and relish.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.163
Do, do, do, do, do-do-do.

07:32.777 --> 07:36.003
I got the idea from the regular pen.

07:36.005 --> 07:38.063
Can I use it on fish and chips?

07:38.068 --> 07:38.842
I don't know.

07:38.845 --> 07:41.411
You can put horseradish on your dead mother for all I care.

07:41.416 --> 07:43.911
The point is: I'm rich,

07:43.918 --> 07:45.452
rich, rich!

07:45.458 --> 07:45.516
I guess there's no way I can embarrass you any further.

07:45.516 --> 07:46.533
Just look

07:46.695 --> 07:50.201
my dog has his own Jacuzzi!

07:53.517 --> 07:54.671
He loves it!

07:56.236 --> 07:57.722
You win, Homer.

07:57.726 --> 08:01.051
I guess there's no way I can embarrass you any further.

08:02.137 --> 08:04.362
Barely Literate,
smells Like Feet

08:04.368 --> 08:08.330
When I, um, grow up, I'm gonna be a rocket scientist!

08:08.705 --> 08:10.242
To Mars!

08:10.245 --> 08:11.150
Zoom.

08:12.127 --> 08:12.951
Zoom.

08:16.735 --> 08:18.501
Ah, bullies approaching.

08:18.508 --> 08:19.952
Activate cloaking device.

08:26.678 --> 08:28.400
Professor Frink, you've become

08:28.408 --> 08:31.730
one of Springfield's most renowned scientific minds.

08:31.738 --> 08:34.221
- You discovered and cured Frink's disease,
- Uh-huh.

08:34.227 --> 08:36.393
created the element Frinkonium,

08:36.398 --> 08:38.931
and invented the eight-month-after pill.

08:38.938 --> 08:40.861
Yes, yes, all right. All of that means nothing, sir.

08:40.866 --> 08:44.762
I've spent my whole life in the lab and never talked to a girl.

08:44.766 --> 08:47.283
That's why I built this time machine.

08:47.288 --> 08:49.262
I give you the chrono-trike!

08:49.267 --> 08:50.960
Now, I'll go back in time

08:50.968 --> 08:53.533
to tell myself to choose a different career,

08:53.536 --> 08:57.803
one where I'll meet a female woman of the girl-u-lar variety.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.873
Have to get the speed going here.

09:09.117 --> 09:10.443
Listen to me, little Frink.

09:10.458 --> 09:12.160
I am here to warn you...

09:13.875 --> 09:14.880
That was...

09:14.888 --> 09:16.983
Hey, I'm still going, but...

09:20.995 --> 09:22.951
Hey... cool!

09:22.957 --> 09:25.212
I want to be a lawyer and a doctor

09:25.218 --> 09:27.322
because a woman can do anything.

09:27.326 --> 09:29.773
At 24, Eleanor had graduated

09:29.777 --> 09:32.353
from Harvard Medical and Yale Law.

09:32.357 --> 09:34.543
Your Honor, I'd like to request a continuance

09:34.548 --> 09:36.051
so I can go deliver a baby.

09:36.057 --> 09:37.210
I love babies.

09:37.218 --> 09:38.753
I'll allow it.

09:40.685 --> 09:42.081
I'm a little burnt-out.

09:42.085 --> 09:44.063
So, sometimes-- don't shoot me--

09:44.068 --> 09:45.920
I have a glass of wine with Buster here.

09:48.068 --> 09:49.603
He's a real comfort.

09:49.608 --> 09:51.130
I might even get a second cat.

09:57.577 --> 10:00.163
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:00.167 --> 10:01.382
Nice kitty.

10:02.167 --> 10:04.321
I like taking pictures.

10:06.998 --> 10:08.320
Whee!

10:10.545 --> 10:12.891
Take my picture. Take my picture.

10:16.105 --> 10:17.992
Aw, crap, my first kiss.

10:17.998 --> 10:20.082
You could do a lot worse, my friend

10:20.978 --> 10:22.070
At age 16,

10:22.076 --> 10:25.490
Marge was the star photographer for her school newspaper.

10:25.508 --> 10:27.432
Cheerleader flung into
next county

10:27.438 --> 10:29.620
Boy brings enough
for everyone

10:29.626 --> 10:31.081
Typing class tragedy

10:31.097 --> 10:34.973
But her interests soon expanded beyond shutterbuggery.

10:34.978 --> 10:38.741
The biggest change for me over the last eight years?

10:38.747 --> 10:40.222
That's got to be Homer.

10:40.225 --> 10:41.322
Marge, baby!

10:41.326 --> 10:44.440
I got a picture of you tattooed on my chest.

10:46.237 --> 10:47.893
They had a sale on skulls.

10:49.525 --> 10:50.701
At 24,

10:50.906 --> 10:55.871
Marge's photojournalistic dreams were,
shall we say, underdeveloped?

10:56.017 --> 10:58.703
I need one wallet-sized photo
for my captain's license.

11:00.057 --> 11:01.050
Coming right up.

11:01.357 --> 11:03.203
Mind if I turn on a little music?

11:05.856 --> 11:07.000
It's so danceable.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.100
Nautical Stu loves disco music.

11:12.106 --> 11:15.242
And the world welcomed Disco Stu.

11:18.506 --> 11:21.302
I need a full-time job
to support Homer

11:21.457 --> 11:23.881
so he has time to work
on his rock music,

11:24.035 --> 11:27.882
his erotic etchings,
his Play-Doh Theater...

11:31.907 --> 11:34.583
And yet look how things turned out.

11:34.727 --> 11:37.581
This overnight affluence must have
come as a tremendous shock.

11:37.945 --> 11:39.562
Oh, yes, sir.

11:39.705 --> 11:43.053
As shocks go, this one's
a real zaparoo.

11:43.208 --> 11:46.021
Listen, something's been
piquing my curiosity.

11:46.145 --> 11:49.482
Why is your medicine cabinet
full of old man ointments?

11:51.066 --> 11:52.452
Oh... mm-hmm.

11:52.757 --> 11:55.752
Well, yeah, the ointments, um...

11:57.286 --> 11:59.572
What are you people doing
in my summer home?

12:01.358 --> 12:04.351
This is Eduardo, my pool boy.

12:04.506 --> 12:07.113
He thinks he's an angry, rich man.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.253
I am an angry, rich man.

12:09.516 --> 12:11.703
That's the pool chemicals talking.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.232
Homer J. Simpson,

12:15.458 --> 12:19.580
your fabulous millionaire
lifestyle is all a lie.

12:19.745 --> 12:23.570
Oh, Father, my pony Buttercup
can jump ever so high...

12:23.575 --> 12:24.950
Hoo-boy, it's Mr. Burns.

12:25.158 --> 12:27.381
Please, Mr. Burns,
pretend you work for me.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.470
You can have the boy.
Just don't beat him.

12:29.656 --> 12:32.000
You can beat him.
Just don't leave marks.

12:32.247 --> 12:34.250
Shut up, you waste of skin and fat.

12:34.517 --> 12:36.233
You've desecrated my every possession.

12:45.355 --> 12:46.263
Oh, thank you, sir.

12:46.467 --> 12:50.100
For three days I've had nothing to read
but clock-setting instructions:

12:50.208 --> 12:52.650
"Using the suspension spring
above the pendulum leader,

12:52.807 --> 12:54.322
hang the pendulum on the
pendulum guide..."

12:55.198 --> 12:57.201
Mr. Burns, we're so sorry.

12:57.507 --> 13:00.801
The plan was just to use your backyard,
and the next thing we know,

13:00.807 --> 13:03.351
Mr. Smithers is tied up in
a grandfather clock.

13:03.445 --> 13:04.461
Please get me out of here.

13:04.756 --> 13:06.503
It's 11:59:59.

13:22.108 --> 13:25.803
I've heard enough.
Release the hounds.

13:25.957 --> 13:28.102
Uh, sir, your hounds are still
at the winter house.

13:28.256 --> 13:31.152
Well, bring them over in the Durango.

13:31.307 --> 13:34.200
Shadow and Winston have
been fighting a lot.

13:34.917 --> 13:36.503
Put Winston in the front.

13:36.635 --> 13:37.850
Winston doesn't like the front.

13:38.016 --> 13:40.301
Just do it. Do it. Do it now!

13:43.305 --> 13:46.601
...and that's how I got the vending
machine contract for the Kremlin.

13:52.008 --> 13:54.042
Sorry, sir.
Traffic was a nightmare.

13:54.348 --> 13:56.701
Then I got caught in some
kind of garlic festival.

13:56.856 --> 13:58.200
Release the hounds.

14:00.546 --> 14:01.490
Stop it, Winston!

14:01.727 --> 14:04.870
In the wake of this deception,
I had two questions for Homer:

14:05.075 --> 14:07.931
"Why lie?" and "Lies... why?"

14:08.368 --> 14:09.982
But he seemed less than eager to meet.

14:10.388 --> 14:12.152
Homer, I brought a squeaky!

14:36.667 --> 14:37.783
Help!

14:38.207 --> 14:41.000
I realized that if this bunny
was going to be boiled,

14:41.206 --> 14:42.962
I would have to turn up the heat.

14:43.556 --> 14:44.573
There you are!

14:44.736 --> 14:46.582
I'm ready for my segment.

14:46.755 --> 14:47.701
Lenny...

14:48.105 --> 14:50.453
always exciting to hear from you.

14:50.978 --> 14:53.370
Did you ever try that new shampoo?

14:53.867 --> 14:54.870
Nope, never did.

14:57.406 --> 14:59.002
Want to watch me pay
my cable bill?

14:59.305 --> 15:01.052
I got checks with
butterflies on them.

15:03.706 --> 15:05.540
- I am interesting.
- No, you're not.

15:07.306 --> 15:08.452
What do you want?

15:08.655 --> 15:10.601
Marge, can you just let
me in for a minute?

15:10.755 --> 15:14.221
We let you in 32 years ago
and it's brought us nothing but pain.

15:14.406 --> 15:16.903
Well, if you want, I can cut
you out of the film.

15:17.057 --> 15:19.743
No, no, no, no, no!
Let's not get crazy.

15:19.957 --> 15:23.350
Then I just want to know why
your husband did what he did.

15:24.508 --> 15:25.931
I'll tell you why.

15:26.207 --> 15:28.232
It's been another eight years
and what do I have?

15:28.536 --> 15:31.742
Same job, same house,
same dirty joke book.

15:38.806 --> 15:41.633
I just thought for once I could
be the cool guy in your movie.

15:42.038 --> 15:45.400
But all I am is the guy who makes
everyone else look good.

15:45.806 --> 15:48.043
Strong words from a dumpy man.

15:48.345 --> 15:49.160
And cut.

15:49.408 --> 15:51.431
Wait just a cotton-swabbing minute!

15:51.637 --> 15:55.353
A good man went to a lot of
trouble just to impress you.

15:55.507 --> 15:58.791
And I went along with it because
I love him to pieces.

15:59.035 --> 16:01.002
And you made him look like a fool.

16:01.237 --> 16:03.562
Well, I don't want you anywhere
near my house!

16:03.776 --> 16:05.363
Now you can cut!

16:07.015 --> 16:08.302
What's the matter, Declan?

16:08.455 --> 16:10.533
Did a cop give you a ticket
for talking like a fruit?

16:10.816 --> 16:12.073
It's the oddest thing.

16:12.315 --> 16:15.972
I actually feel affection for these
knuckle-dragging sub-monkeys.

16:16.288 --> 16:18.152
I feel sorry for Homer Simpson.

16:18.308 --> 16:20.100
What,
have you been sipping cuckoo juice?

16:20.256 --> 16:21.242
Homer's got it made.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.133
He's married to one hell of a woman.

16:23.285 --> 16:26.590
All I've got is this porn channel
I'm too cheap to descramble.

16:27.747 --> 16:29.831
- That's an ad for shoe inserts.
- What the....?

16:30.005 --> 16:31.603
I've been writing creepy
letters to that?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.540
But what you said about
Homer, it's...

16:33.746 --> 16:35.503
it's given me a brilliant idea!

16:35.706 --> 16:38.450
An action movie where I play the Pope
who kills the president?

16:38.607 --> 16:40.343
No, that's a terrible idea.

16:40.495 --> 16:42.600
Yeah, I know. It's stupid.
I think it could work, though.

16:42.756 --> 16:45.271
I've even got a title:
Pontiff No Return.

16:45.477 --> 16:47.260
I came up with it,
but I don't really get it.

16:47.676 --> 16:50.950
The next day,
I invited Homer to my editing bay.

16:55.998 --> 16:59.501
- Oh, my God, the view!
- This makes it all worth it!

16:59.708 --> 17:01.700
Yeah, it's not so much fun
when you're blind.

17:01.856 --> 17:03.550
At least you made it
up the mountain.

17:03.736 --> 17:04.942
No thanks to you two.

17:06.896 --> 17:09.310
All right, you lured me to your bay.

17:09.686 --> 17:11.632
Now what sick game are you playing?

17:11.835 --> 17:13.420
I have some footage to show you.

17:13.627 --> 17:14.800
O, spirit!

17:15.007 --> 17:16.491
Are you gonna show me my future?

17:16.696 --> 17:19.099
My snow-flecked grave,
mourned by no man?

17:19.257 --> 17:21.002
Well, it's not too late
for me to change!

17:21.455 --> 17:22.450
You there, boy!

17:22.608 --> 17:23.971
Buy me a Christmas goose!

17:24.175 --> 17:25.681
The biggest one in the shop!

17:25.887 --> 17:27.233
And then what?

17:27.537 --> 17:29.490
Homer, come over here
and take a look at this.

17:29.696 --> 17:33.481
I've gone over 100,000 hours
of Springfield footage

17:33.666 --> 17:36.700
twice-- and put together
something you must see.

17:39.705 --> 17:42.503
If I could trade lives with anybody,
I'd pick Homer.

17:42.655 --> 17:43.941
Have you been to Homer's house?

17:44.106 --> 17:47.462
It's got a back yard, a front yard...
The place is like yard city!

17:47.625 --> 17:48.981
I love his laugh.

17:49.085 --> 17:51.701
He picked the perfect time
to lock in his mortgage.

17:51.906 --> 17:55.100
He's the kindest, sweetest,
most generous man

17:55.255 --> 17:56.842
ever to drive through
my living room.

17:57.248 --> 17:59.242
I'll pay for most of this!

17:59.857 --> 18:02.451
He may not be perfect,
but he's my dad.

18:02.857 --> 18:04.933
Homer gave me a kidney.

18:05.135 --> 18:08.733
It wasn't his, I didn't need it,
and it came postage due,

18:08.788 --> 18:10.953
but still, a lovely gesture.

18:11.155 --> 18:13.231
I like when Daddy's out of work

18:13.437 --> 18:15.381
'cause he can spend more time with me.

18:18.946 --> 18:22.421
At bedtime, he tucks me in tighter
than anyone else could.

18:22.925 --> 18:23.602
And you know what?

18:24.106 --> 18:26.442
No monsters have gotten me yet.

18:26.648 --> 18:27.541
Wow...

18:27.695 --> 18:29.900
I have a pretty good life after all.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.641
Homer!
Don't kill the foreign man!

18:32.906 --> 18:34.192
Relax, Marge.

18:35.178 --> 18:36.380
I wasn't gonna kill him.

18:39.506 --> 18:41.650
All those years I was
dreaming of other things,

18:41.805 --> 18:43.901
I was actually doing
what I really wanted:

18:44.055 --> 18:47.503
hanging out with my family,
drinking with my friends,

18:47.655 --> 18:51.642
making friends with my family
and hanging with my drinking.

18:52.147 --> 18:54.902
Marge, you're my real
dream come true.

18:55.207 --> 18:57.603
And I get to live you every day.

18:57.808 --> 18:59.652
Oh, Homie!

18:59.806 --> 19:03.290
You make each eight-year interval
better than the last!
