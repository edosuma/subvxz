00:45.345 --> 00:49.548
- A fire-fighting robot, George?
- Yes Sir. Imagine it,

00:49.550 --> 00:52.017
with heat-sensing eyes,

00:52.086 --> 00:55.087
moving towards the fire wielding a hose!

00:55.155 --> 00:58.157
Could one build such a thing, Sir?

00:58.225 --> 01:00.959
- I suppose...
- Have you considered

01:01.027 --> 01:03.996
the potential effect such a
machine will have on humankind?

01:04.031 --> 01:06.231
Well, yes. This one would put out fires.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.368
But if these robots can
supplant a person's vocation,

01:09.436 --> 01:11.970
their very source of meaning in life,

01:12.038 --> 01:14.039
- what will become of them?
- In this case, it would take

01:14.107 --> 01:16.842
over a dangerous occupation,
potentially saving lives.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.711
And what happens when
this automation spreads

01:19.713 --> 01:21.880
to other duties, like our own?

01:21.948 --> 01:25.183
A robot constable, Sir!

01:25.186 --> 01:27.119
Robocopper.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.488
Good morning,
Mr Dilbert.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.990
Ah. Good morning,
Detective Murdoch.

01:32.059 --> 01:34.159
Mr Dilbert, Detective Watts,

01:34.227 --> 01:37.429
- Constable Crabtree.
- Very good.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.065
Well, nice to see you,
Detective. But I can't dally.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.803
Mr Dilbert supervised
Inspector Brackenreid

01:44.872 --> 01:47.206
when he was dismissed and
sent to work at City Records.

01:47.241 --> 01:50.075
Got along like chalk
and cheese I'd imagine.

01:50.143 --> 01:53.078
You know, I always thought...

01:53.146 --> 01:56.014
In a few minutes,
we will encounter two prime examples

01:56.016 --> 01:58.984
of Toronto's prosperity
and modern architecture

01:59.052 --> 02:01.720
in the form of the Gooderham Building,

02:01.788 --> 02:03.822
and the Board of Trade Building.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.424
Home to Gooderham and Worts,

02:06.427 --> 02:09.060
it is a notable flatiron building.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.430
Good morning.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.265
Good morning,
Mr Dilbert.

02:15.368 --> 02:18.070
Isn't it nice today?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.105
Right.

02:25.745 --> 02:28.113
Oh!

02:31.151 --> 02:33.418
Oh!

02:50.937 --> 02:52.771
Oh my goodness!

02:56.009 --> 02:57.842
My chickens!
They are escaping!

02:57.911 --> 03:00.179
- John! Are you all right?
- Just got a fright is all.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.191
She thinks her leg is broken.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.993
John, go to the call box
and call for an ambulance.

03:15.061 --> 03:16.928
And notify Station House Number Four,

03:16.997 --> 03:19.064
- have them fetch Doctor Ogden.
- Yes, Sir.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.238
You there! What have you done?

03:26.306 --> 03:28.974
Look what you've done to
my carriage, you idiot!

03:29.042 --> 03:30.976
Do you not see we had the right of way?

03:30.978 --> 03:33.011
You entered the crossing early.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.213
We entered at exactly
the right time, you...

03:35.282 --> 03:37.849
you bumble-fisted mutt!
Do you not know

03:37.851 --> 03:39.618
- where your brake pedal is?
- Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.621
I... I stood on my brakes,
there was no time to stop!

03:42.623 --> 03:45.290
- Here.
- Detective!

03:49.362 --> 03:51.163
Oh dear.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.067
Mr Dilbert.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.035
- Are you all right?
- Quite all right.

03:57.103 --> 03:58.870
That's lucky, isn't it?

03:58.872 --> 04:01.506
Yes, quite.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.011
George...

04:06.079 --> 04:08.013
- call for a second ambulance.
- Yes, Sir.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.617
Isn't this unfortunate?

04:16.624 --> 04:18.890
at's going on up the?

04:18.958 --> 04:22.728
An ambulance will be on
its way, Mr Dilbert.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.297
You foresee I'll have
to go to the hospital?

04:25.365 --> 04:27.165
Well,
yes.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.801
I am expected to open the office.

04:29.803 --> 04:34.105
- Are you in pain, Mr Dilbert?
- Well, now, I can manage.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.841
- Remarkable.
- I am squeezed

04:36.844 --> 04:40.011
rather tightly, though.
Perhaps if this gentleman could

04:40.080 --> 04:43.181
put his automobile in reverse?

04:43.249 --> 04:45.450
Sir, John is fetching
a second ambulance.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.519
Right. George, the automobile's fender

04:47.587 --> 04:49.521
is jammed in the wagon. We need tools.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.524
Right.

04:52.526 --> 04:56.528
Oi! You there!
Come here, young man.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.531
- Do you know where May Street is?
- Yes, Sir.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.567
I want you to go to Bloom and
Crabtree's, find Sam Bloom,

05:02.635 --> 05:04.436
tell him you need metal cutters.
Tell him George sent you.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.938
- Quick as a wink now!
- Right away, Sir!

05:07.006 --> 05:10.542
Some people shouldn't be
allowed to drive motorcars.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.844
You'll pay for the
damage to my carriage!

05:12.912 --> 05:14.679
I am under no obligation.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.481
Well, how do you like
this for obligation? Huh?

05:16.550 --> 05:18.617
All right! That's enough,
gentlemen. Calm down.

05:18.685 --> 05:21.486
I am a very good driver!

05:21.488 --> 05:23.655
I avoided the little baby, didn't I?

05:23.724 --> 05:26.925
- You bloody well didn't avoid me!
- What baby?

05:28.995 --> 05:31.129
A woman with a pram crossed the
street right in front of me.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.932
I yanked my steering wheel
to avoid hitting her.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.802
Saved that baby's life.
And this is the thanks I get!

05:45.913 --> 05:47.879
Miss Sommer needs medical attention.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.448
- The ambulance has been called.
- Well, you might tell her that.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.585
She doesn't understand a thing I say.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.455
She says she wants a refund

05:57.524 --> 05:59.457
- on your tour.
- Refund! That fellow

05:59.526 --> 06:01.459
in the motorcar can pay the refunds.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.463
- I want his name.
- Excuse me, Constable. Could I

06:04.531 --> 06:06.498
- offer any assistance here?
- Hello. Very good of you

06:06.566 --> 06:09.167
- to stop, Miss...
- Nurse Liston.

06:09.235 --> 06:12.303
- Are there any injured?
- This woman has a broken leg.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.006
And there's a chap pinned by a motorcar

06:15.074 --> 06:16.975
over here. He seems in a bad way...

06:17.043 --> 06:19.177
Allow me to take you to him.

06:19.245 --> 06:23.181
How long is this going to take?

06:23.249 --> 06:26.851
Oh, good!

06:26.920 --> 06:28.686
A nurse!

06:28.755 --> 06:31.456
Can you tell me?
I think I broke my nose.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.792
Certainly, I'll have a look.
Come and take a seat over here...

06:33.860 --> 06:35.827
- I believe this gentleman...
- This will only take a moment.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.396
..over here is more seriously injured.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.401
Ahem!
Ahem!

06:43.470 --> 06:46.871
Cars and carriages are backed up.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.040
Police constables are on their way.
They'll help to redirect

06:49.108 --> 06:51.042
- traffic around the accident.
- Fine for some,

06:51.110 --> 06:54.379
but I am on tracks. You see?

06:54.381 --> 06:57.549
Tracks run through here You'll have

06:57.617 --> 07:00.419
- to shift this lot out.
- We have injured parties, Sir.

07:00.454 --> 07:03.588
I keep a schedule, Sir.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.590
- Folks like to reckon on it.
- Nothing will be moving until

07:05.659 --> 07:07.692
medical assistance arrives.

07:07.694 --> 07:11.362
In the meantime we could use a crowbar.
Perhaps you could help find one?

07:11.365 --> 07:13.364
Mm.

07:18.037 --> 07:19.804
Come on,

07:19.807 --> 07:21.973
let's clear this!

07:22.041 --> 07:25.277
What's going on?

07:25.345 --> 07:28.947
All right, Mr Flannery.
Brace yourself,

07:29.015 --> 07:31.917
this will hurt.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.092
Hey there!
What do you think you are doing?

07:41.161 --> 07:43.161
Help me unhitch these horses right away.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.730
- But I've got to be on my way!
- As long as this man

07:45.798 --> 07:48.399
is trapped, your wagon is going nowhere.

07:48.402 --> 07:51.036
- Right.
- Thank you.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.942
OK, help me get them back in.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.513
Oh! Oh!
Chickens!

08:01.581 --> 08:04.215
How am I supposed to fix this?

08:04.284 --> 08:06.618
This?! Be thankful you are not hurt.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.720
That's all going to
change once Mr Nicastro

08:08.788 --> 08:10.588
sees how banged up his vehicle is!

08:10.591 --> 08:13.224
I am going to catch a whooping
if I don't make this delivery.

08:13.293 --> 08:16.061
Well, listen.
We'll round up these chickens

08:16.129 --> 08:19.097
and then we'll get a few lads
together and set your wagon straight.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.199
John?

08:21.267 --> 08:23.935
- You all right, son?
- I am in one piece.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.237
Oh, thank God for that.
If anything happened to you,

08:26.306 --> 08:28.172
your mother would have
my guts for garters.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.076
All right, lads.
Let's see

08:31.144 --> 08:33.078
how many chickens you can catch each.

08:33.145 --> 08:36.481
Get that out of the way!

08:36.517 --> 08:38.416
Mr Dilbert?
Bloody hell.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.485
Hello, Inspector.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.187
Good to see you.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.189
- Bad circumstances.
- Well, now, let's...

08:45.258 --> 08:47.125
let's hope it looks worse than it is.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.861
Do you mind if this nurse
has a look, Mr Dilbert?

08:49.929 --> 08:52.463
- Let's get him out of here, Murdoch.
- Sir, the motorcar

08:52.532 --> 08:55.033
is caught up on the wagon and
we are awaiting an ambulance.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.035
I suppose there may be an
extended stay at the hospital.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.270
Most inconvenient.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.772
How will City Records run without you?

09:00.840 --> 09:03.174
Very poorly.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.110
William!

09:06.113 --> 09:08.313
I am glad you are here!

09:08.381 --> 09:10.448
Excuse me.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.450
- William.
- Right this way.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.419
- Are there many injured?
- There's a woman on the other

09:14.487 --> 09:16.388
side of the carriage who
fell off when the motorcar

09:16.456 --> 09:18.323
struck them.
She appears to have a broken leg.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.192
The driver of this motorcar has an
injury to his face. And this man...

09:21.261 --> 09:24.128
- Isn't that Mr Dilbert?
- It is.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.397
He's pinned there.
I am attempting to separate

09:26.466 --> 09:28.499
the automobile from the
wagon where it's fetched up.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.269
- What are his injuries?
- I don't know,

09:31.271 --> 09:34.405
he claims to not be in pain,
but I suspect it's much worse

09:34.408 --> 09:37.809
than he's saying.
He's a very stoic sort.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.744
Doctor.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.746
Hello, Mr Dilbert.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.682
Ah, Doctor Ogden.
Aren't I popular today?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.217
You certainly have our attention.

09:46.285 --> 09:48.186
I'll examine Mr Dilbert.
You assess the woman

09:48.254 --> 09:51.489
on the other side, and then we'll
decide who goes to the hospital first.

09:51.491 --> 09:54.959
I'll go with you and make introductions.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.328
How am I doing?

09:57.331 --> 09:59.230
It's a very good sign

09:59.299 --> 10:01.199
that you are conscious and alert.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.335
It means that your blood pressure
is good. Hello, I am Nurse Liston.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.404
Here you are!

10:08.441 --> 10:12.110
- Thank you, Mr...?
- Hubert. Now I got you

10:12.178 --> 10:14.079
your crowbar, I see you got
your medical assistance,

10:14.147 --> 10:17.048
how much longer would you say?

10:17.117 --> 10:19.050
Not long now.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.053
5, 10 minutes?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.789
What's the holdup?

10:24.858 --> 10:28.359
Ah, good man,

10:28.362 --> 10:31.096
- that was very quick!
- Thank you Sir!

10:33.166 --> 10:35.600
Sir.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.702
Ah. Thank you, George.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.071
Right, could you please
get in the motorcar

10:40.073 --> 10:42.340
and steer it as we push
it back on my say so.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.209
OK,
Sir.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.553
Miss Sommer took issue with my
pronunciation and banished me.

10:55.555 --> 10:58.023
Can I be of some assistance here?

11:00.027 --> 11:03.361
- Mm, yes.
- Inspector.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.296
All set, Mr Dilbert?

11:05.298 --> 11:07.398
- I am ready.
- One,

11:07.467 --> 11:10.568
- two, three...
- Stop!

11:10.636 --> 11:12.970
Don't move the motorcar.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.872
Why not?

11:14.941 --> 11:17.442
We'll be back in a moment, Mr Dilbert.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.555
Mr Dilbert's pelvis is badly crushed.

11:30.623 --> 11:34.259
- And he's bleeding internally.
- But there's hardly any blood.

11:34.327 --> 11:37.628
He's not bleeding much now
because of the tamponade effect

11:37.697 --> 11:40.532
- created by the motorcar itself.
- Well, what does that mean?

11:40.600 --> 11:43.468
It means the motorcar is
holding him together.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.571
When we move it,
he'll begin to bleed profusely.

11:46.639 --> 11:49.240
It's likely Mr Dilbert will not survive.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.760
That all sounds a bit grim.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.661
Doctor, look at him.
He's barely sweating.

12:10.664 --> 12:14.031
Yes, but he will have had
damage to major arteries.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.167
When we move the motorcar, there's...

12:16.169 --> 12:18.202
The poor bugger isn't going
to make it out alive, is he?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.238
I am afraid not.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.440
Would you like me to explain it to him?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.876
I'll tell him.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.311
Very well.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.981
Nurse, shall we check
on the other patient?

12:30.049 --> 12:31.983
Of course.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.721
Sir, one other thing.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.856
Not as dire as Mr Dilbert's predicament,

12:38.859 --> 12:40.959
- but I noticed it nonetheless.
- What is it?

12:41.027 --> 12:44.128
When I pushed on the brake
in Mr Flannery's motorcar,

12:44.131 --> 12:46.531
it seemed unusually loose.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.066
- Let's have a look.
- What's happening?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.402
What did the doctor say?

12:51.404 --> 12:54.038
The inspector will explain.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.407
We just need to look at something.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.918
Well... look at that.

13:06.986 --> 13:08.920
Sir, some of these strands look frayed,

13:08.988 --> 13:10.955
but most look clean cut.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.757
If the wire was partially cut,

13:12.793 --> 13:14.792
the brakes would work for a time.

13:14.861 --> 13:17.461
Until he hit the brakes hard here.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.598
This is not normal wear and tear,
Sir, I can tell you.

13:20.666 --> 13:22.600
No. Not normal at all.

13:22.668 --> 13:24.569
This was no accident.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.437
The way the doctor describes it...

13:26.506 --> 13:28.472
You needn't repeat yourself.
I am sorry, Inspector Brackenreid.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.341
- Tom. Please, Tom.
- But I just cannot believe

13:30.343 --> 13:32.643
that doctor can know her
head from her elbow.

13:32.712 --> 13:36.013
I feel just fine.
Don't I look fine?

13:36.082 --> 13:37.949
Remarkably well,
under the circumstances.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.784
Isn't she a coroner? I mean,
she's not even a proper doctor.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.586
How many automobile
accidents has she attended

13:41.654 --> 13:43.821
- before this one?
- None that I know of.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.057
Precisely. Precisely my point.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.826
I will be going home
when this is all over.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.599
Here!
Here! Agh!

13:54.667 --> 13:56.601
Last one.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.669
What about my wagon?

13:58.738 --> 14:00.605
Never fear.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.508
Me and the Constables will have
you on your way. Lads! John!

14:11.751 --> 14:13.818
Who would want to hurt me?

14:13.887 --> 14:17.088
Nobody! I am a friend to all I meet.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.157
Although... I suppose my best chum

14:19.225 --> 14:21.993
- is a bit off me at the moment.
- What's his name?

14:22.061 --> 14:24.963
Ian Porter. I had a little
flirt with his fiancÃ©e.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.968
- Oh, very good.
- Then there's my stepfather.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.571
He's never truly taken a shine to me.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.774
I do believe he's the one who convinced
Mama to cut me out of her will.

14:36.776 --> 14:39.510
And I suppose you could say my
college roommate and, well,

14:39.578 --> 14:42.113
pretty much all of my rowing
teammates, come to that.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.982
But most people like me.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.851
Except that fellow at
the pub last night.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.887
You were at that pub last night?

14:48.922 --> 14:51.189
There's no crime in that, is there?

14:51.257 --> 14:53.491
Where was your motorcar
parked while you were inside?

14:53.493 --> 14:56.327
On the street outside my rooms.
I live a couple blocks away.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.429
Well, the man from the pub
may have followed you there.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.564
What a ridiculous thought, surely.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.167
Someone has tampered with your motorcar.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.804
John!

15:06.872 --> 15:08.806
- Give us a hand.
- Certainly.

15:08.874 --> 15:11.776
Do you think we can move this
wagon up and away from the wall?

15:11.844 --> 15:13.744
With a couple more men, sure.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.047
- Or three.
- All right, then.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.149
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!

15:18.217 --> 15:20.818
We need this autocar moved
off as soon as possible.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.888
All right lads, on one.

15:23.956 --> 15:26.290
Three, two, one!

15:28.361 --> 15:32.530
Holy heart of Mary! John!

15:32.598 --> 15:34.999
- Fetch the fire department.
- Yes, Sir.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.870
A few minutes later and I'd
be driving to the office

15:39.939 --> 15:42.039
out on Glen Road,
across the ravine.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.241
Perhaps that was the idea, Detective.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.644
Have my brakes snap

15:46.713 --> 15:49.080
and I drive right into the ravine!

15:49.148 --> 15:51.249
If someone wanted to
do you serious harm.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.219
Bad luck,
eh, Sir?

15:55.287 --> 15:57.255
Sorry about that.

15:57.323 --> 16:00.625
Not at all. I am sure you
did your best to stop.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.528
Do you know the name of the
man that you quarreled with

16:04.531 --> 16:06.530
at the pub last night, Mr Flannery?

16:06.533 --> 16:08.666
Do you really think it could be him?

16:08.668 --> 16:11.168
I suppose you must ask.

16:11.237 --> 16:14.605
Bob? Bill?
Martin?

16:14.674 --> 16:16.774
I... I don't know.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.377
Oh, but I'd wager the
barmaid would know him.

16:19.445 --> 16:22.113
Good day, gentlemen.
We'll be open in 10 minutes.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.420
I cross this street every day. I never

16:29.488 --> 16:32.390
expected it to be rife with danger.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.059
Is there anyone we can call,

16:35.127 --> 16:37.295
someone who needs to know
you've had an accident?

16:37.363 --> 16:39.998
My parents are gone some years now.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.099
I never married.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.269
- I regret that.
- John!

16:45.338 --> 16:49.040
- Fancy a whiskey, Mr Dilbert?
- I never drink in the morning.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.575
Of course not. Neither do I. But if ever

16:51.578 --> 16:53.778
- there was a day to start.
- I suppose you are right.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.380
- John, get some whiskeys.
- Make mine a double.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.682
Atta boy, Mr Dilbert.
Same for me too.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.818
Mr Dilbert.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.887
- Doctor.
- The patient

17:02.955 --> 17:04.954
with the broken leg is
ready to be transported.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.957
But the second ambulance
hasn't arrived yet.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.593
- Where the bloody hell is it?
- It may not come.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.662
We need to decide whether Miss Sommer

17:11.664 --> 17:13.731
goes first, or Mr Dilbert.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.700
If we move him to an ambulance now...

17:16.769 --> 17:19.203
Yes. But if Miss Sommer

17:19.271 --> 17:21.338
goes first, it may be some time

17:21.340 --> 17:24.442
before the ambulance returns.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.251
- Give the German the wagon.
- Very well.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.292
How's that poor man doing?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.294
As well as could be expected.

17:43.362 --> 17:45.729
Here. Take him the whole bottle.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.365
I could set my clock by that
little man who got hit.

17:48.434 --> 17:51.068
He walks by every day at the same time.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.370
Did you see the accident?

17:53.439 --> 17:55.372
No. I was late opening today.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.441
My mother's ill.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.444
One of the men involved

18:00.513 --> 18:02.980
claims he was here last night,
and may have

18:03.049 --> 18:05.015
gotten into an argument
with another man.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.252
I saw Mr Flannery out there.
He's a regular. Not a drunk,

18:08.254 --> 18:10.454
but more the sort who's always

18:10.523 --> 18:14.024
looking for a chat, but he rubs
people the wrong way, you know?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.927
Oh, most definitely.

18:17.997 --> 18:21.465
- Who was he arguing with?
- It might've been someone

18:21.468 --> 18:24.802
- called Bill or Bob?
- Jeremy. Jeremy Hunter.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.737
Stopping for a drink, are you?

18:26.806 --> 18:29.473
You told me you would have this
cleared away in 10 minutes.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.676
Now, that's not exactly
what I said, Mr Hubert.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.411
- It's been 15.
- We have injured parties.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.115
You said you wanted an ambulance,
an ambulance came.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.650
You said you wanted a crowbar,
I went and got you a crowbar.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.253
Everyone is doing their job.
You'll just have to be patient.

18:42.321 --> 18:46.424
I have been good and patient!
And now I'd like

18:46.492 --> 18:48.459
to get through instead of
sitting on my arse all day

18:48.461 --> 18:50.461
with a hot carload of angry passengers.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.630
We'll get it cleared away
as soon as possible.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.832
- Bull...
- If you get yourself arrested,

18:54.834 --> 18:57.835
Mr Hubert, you won't be taking
your passengers anywhere.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.471
I am telephoning my manager.

19:27.132 --> 19:29.300
All right, lads.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.438
Ready?

19:37.010 --> 19:39.910
Three, two, one!

19:41.748 --> 19:44.081
No! The pigs! The pigs! Oh, the pigs!

19:44.149 --> 19:46.083
Don't let them get away!

19:46.151 --> 19:47.918
- Come back!
- All right, lads. Three,

19:47.987 --> 19:49.887
two,
one!

19:57.196 --> 20:00.297
All right.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.200
To friends.

20:03.269 --> 20:06.470
To friends. May I be in heaven
before the devil knows I am dead.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.106
I doubt you'll end up
anywhere near the devil,

20:09.108 --> 20:10.942
but I'll drink to that just the same.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.479
Five minutes earlier.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.581
Or five minutes later.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.784
But the office must be unlocked at 8:55,

20:19.852 --> 20:22.119
the same time every day.

20:22.187 --> 20:23.887
You can't think like that, Dilton.

20:23.956 --> 20:27.057
No matter what you do,
you can't try and control everything.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.892
Bad things just happen.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.462
And today it's happening to me.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.399
Is there anyone I can call?

20:35.467 --> 20:38.402
- I've already said there's no one.
- A priest, maybe?

20:38.470 --> 20:41.606
The afterlife is the least
of my concerns, Tom.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.507
I still have work to do.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.814
There is someone I'd like to see.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.650
- Yes?
- There are a number

20:52.652 --> 20:54.652
of open projects on my desk.
There is one other

20:54.654 --> 20:57.621
city employee competent enough
to resolve them if I am...

20:57.690 --> 21:00.024
unable to fulfill my duty.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.359
All right. So,
who can I call?

21:02.362 --> 21:04.628
Miss Mildred Ash.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.697
A trustworthy public servant, yes.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.966
She works in the Sewage Department.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.502
Constable!

21:11.504 --> 21:13.437
Go to the Sewage Department

21:13.439 --> 21:15.773
at the municipal offices
and fetch Miss Millicent...

21:15.775 --> 21:17.975
- Mildred.
- Mildred Ash.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.511
And be quick about it.

21:24.483 --> 21:26.384
Careful there, boy!

21:26.452 --> 21:28.786
Don't let him get away!

21:28.854 --> 21:30.788
Over here!

21:30.856 --> 21:33.924
Agh! Stop moving!

21:36.929 --> 21:39.597
I got it!

21:44.937 --> 21:47.204
What's this?

21:49.075 --> 21:51.041
Do you think it's that Lady's pram?

21:51.110 --> 21:52.943
From the accident?

21:53.011 --> 21:55.813
What do you suppose
it's doing back here?

21:55.881 --> 21:58.148
There's no baby.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.150
Does that seem odd to you, George?

22:00.219 --> 22:02.086
It does, John.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.127
- So the pram was just here?
- Yes, Sir.

22:10.195 --> 22:12.296
No sign of a baby?

22:12.364 --> 22:14.365
No,
Sir.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.500
Do you think this has anything
to do with the sabotage

22:16.569 --> 22:18.569
of Mr Flannery's motorcar?

22:18.637 --> 22:22.139
What if there never was
a baby in the pram?

22:22.207 --> 22:24.208
What if it was a ruse

22:24.276 --> 22:26.310
to cause Mr Flannery to swerve?

22:26.379 --> 22:29.580
Then why would she
abandon her coat there?

22:29.582 --> 22:33.050
There seem to be several people
who would wish Mr Flannery harm.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.986
Perhaps the woman in the
orange coat was one of them.

22:36.054 --> 22:38.589
Right.
George, John,

22:38.591 --> 22:40.524
canvass the area and see
if anyone can give you

22:40.526 --> 22:42.526
a description of the woman
who was pushing the pram.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.995
Sir.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.002
Oh, dear.

22:52.071 --> 22:55.373
Put that camera away!

22:55.408 --> 22:57.975
Can you tell me about the
situation here, Inspector?

22:58.043 --> 23:00.544
Everything that needs to
be done is getting done.

23:00.546 --> 23:04.314
Mr... the gentleman doesn't
want any photographs.

23:04.317 --> 23:06.917
- Can you tell me his name?
- No.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.420
He wants his privacy. Now please,

23:09.488 --> 23:12.556
move along,
young Lady.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.536
Do you want to be part of the
story yourself, Inspector?

23:25.604 --> 23:27.504
It's Inspector Thomas C. Brackenreid.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.473
- B-R-A-C-K...
- Inspector!

23:29.541 --> 23:31.341
Rein her in, Crabtree!

23:31.410 --> 23:33.210
Miss Cherry,

23:33.212 --> 23:35.779
what are you doing here?

23:35.782 --> 23:37.848
Lord knows what I'll do now.

23:37.850 --> 23:41.118
Everything's going to be fine.

23:43.288 --> 23:45.322
Mr Flannery.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.524
We believe the woman pushing the pram

23:47.527 --> 23:49.460
may be involved in the plot to harm you.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.462
You don't say?

23:51.530 --> 23:53.730
The Ladies usually like me.

23:53.799 --> 23:57.401
You said she stepped
out in front of you.

23:57.403 --> 23:59.670
You must have seen her. Think.

23:59.738 --> 24:01.972
Did she look at all familiar?

24:02.040 --> 24:04.842
It all happened so fast.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.710
And... I only had eyes on the pram,

24:06.712 --> 24:08.145
trying to avoid hitting it, you know.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.113
This is the coat she was wearing.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.982
Perhaps it belongs to someone you know?

24:12.050 --> 24:13.884
I am sorry.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.953
I can't help you, Detectives.

24:20.826 --> 24:22.593
Well, I was driving up on
this long line of vehicles

24:22.661 --> 24:25.362
and I realised something quite
serious must have happened here.

24:25.430 --> 24:27.231
Right, so you thought you would come

24:27.299 --> 24:30.200
- take a look for yourself?
- I am tired of apologising

24:30.269 --> 24:32.936
to you for doing my job,
George. It's terribly boring

24:33.005 --> 24:34.905
after a while.
I wonder you

24:34.974 --> 24:37.908
- don't ask Miss Bloom the same.
- Well, I like Miss Bloom.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.478
I am sorry,
it's just...

24:40.513 --> 24:43.981
this is the... the worst
day of this chap's life.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.250
Perhaps instead of worrying
about taking his photo,

24:46.318 --> 24:49.086
you could... find some way of helping.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.136
Thank you for that, Tom.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.138
Some people are daft as muck.

25:08.206 --> 25:10.941
That's exactly what my
father used to say.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.610
- Was he from Yorkshire?
- His parents were.

25:13.679 --> 25:17.548
He died in his bed at the age of 65.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.816
I expected the same.

25:19.819 --> 25:22.953
Hoped for the same.

25:22.955 --> 25:26.090
You don't deserve this, Dilton.

25:29.494 --> 25:32.996
Did you know that before I
became manager at City Records,

25:33.065 --> 25:36.433
it was my job to file
death certificates?

25:36.502 --> 25:39.703
I put them all in their correct places.

25:39.772 --> 25:42.640
I didn't think often
about the lives lived.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.077
It occurs to me now...

25:47.145 --> 25:49.446
that's quite odd.

25:49.448 --> 25:52.482
When one deals in the business of death

25:52.551 --> 25:54.552
it's best not to look too close.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.587
No.

25:56.655 --> 25:59.757
No. One must perform one's function.

26:02.528 --> 26:05.228
Thank you. Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.230
Did you see the accident
here this morning?

26:07.299 --> 26:10.467
Oh, Sir, did you see the
accident here this morning?

26:10.535 --> 26:12.336
Do you recall a woman pushing a pram?

26:12.404 --> 26:14.405
A woman wearing this coat?

26:14.473 --> 26:17.074
Wearing an orange coat, pushing a pram.

26:17.142 --> 26:20.077
- This one.
- Did you happen to see her face?

26:20.145 --> 26:23.814
Mr Dilbert!

26:23.816 --> 26:25.882
Oh!

26:25.885 --> 26:28.018
Thank you for coming, Miss Ash.

26:28.020 --> 26:32.022
- This is my friend,
Inspector Brackenreid.
- Pleasure.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.957
The Constable came to fetch me.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.926
I feared you were hurt.

26:35.994 --> 26:39.396
Well it seems I am. I am...

26:39.464 --> 26:42.666
I will be incapacitated
for quite some time.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.435
Oh my goodness, I am sorry to hear it.

26:45.504 --> 26:48.271
Thank you.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.608
I called for you because I wished

26:51.677 --> 26:53.711
to ask for your assistance

26:53.779 --> 26:55.779
in completing the filing of my report

26:55.781 --> 26:57.781
on the water treatment applications.

26:57.783 --> 27:01.051
Of course I will do whatever
you need, Mr Dilbert.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.120
Very well.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.757
That puts my mind at ease.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.632
Mr Flannery seems to have an
injury to his midsection.

27:15.701 --> 27:17.601
- Did you examine him?
- I haven't, but...

27:17.670 --> 27:21.138
Yes, hello.
Toronto Railway Company here again.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.107
Just a moment.
Could you ask him

27:24.176 --> 27:26.610
if he'd like to be seen and
let me know what you find.

27:26.612 --> 27:29.546
Of course.

27:29.614 --> 27:32.215
- Yes, hello again.
- Spoke to my manager.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.218
He wanted me to tell
you that there are now

27:34.286 --> 27:37.421
three streetcars backed up
either side of this mess.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.790
Yes, I can see that.
Streetcars are a flawed system.

27:39.858 --> 27:42.159
All because of a little smash up.

27:42.227 --> 27:44.294
This is a crime scene, Mr Hubert.

27:44.362 --> 27:46.296
A crime scene!

27:46.364 --> 27:48.432
Well, that's a new one!
Look. You don't

27:48.500 --> 27:50.467
see this every day. I do.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.970
Autos smashing into lantern poles.
Autos smashing

27:53.038 --> 27:54.972
into other autos.
Autos smashing into people.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.575
This is not a crime scene.
It's a traffic accident. Simple.

27:58.577 --> 28:01.244
We also have a man

28:01.247 --> 28:03.647
trapped over there who will likely die

28:03.715 --> 28:06.516
when we attempt to move him.
We are giving him some time.

28:06.585 --> 28:09.486
Doctors ride the TRC, Detective.

28:09.554 --> 28:11.522
Doctors on their way to hospital.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.423
How many other people should die

28:13.492 --> 28:15.559
for your man over there?

28:15.627 --> 28:18.729
If you have any doctors
on your streetcar,

28:18.797 --> 28:21.565
I suggest you summon a taxicab for them.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.642
Mr Flannery refused treatment.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.746
He says he's not injured
around the middle at all.

28:35.814 --> 28:38.815
William, there's something
very odd about his injuries.

28:38.818 --> 28:42.085
- Yes?
- Most drivers who crash

28:42.088 --> 28:44.387
the front of their motorcar
are propelled forward

28:44.456 --> 28:46.957
into the steering wheel,
striking their chest,

28:47.025 --> 28:50.160
sometimes inducing a heart attack.

28:50.162 --> 28:54.364
But Mr Flannery injured his nose.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.137
What are you looking for, Murdoch?

29:00.205 --> 29:03.573
A piece of rope or a... John.

29:03.576 --> 29:06.910
Have a look in all of the garbage
cans around this intersection.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.912
I am looking for a piece of rope

29:08.980 --> 29:10.914
or a large leather belt.
That sort of thing.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.916
Yes Sir.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.918
Detective.

29:14.986 --> 29:17.254
Nobody particularly remembers
anything about a woman

29:17.322 --> 29:19.256
- in an orange coat.
- It seems most people's

29:19.324 --> 29:21.658
attention was captured by the accident.

29:21.727 --> 29:24.094
What do you need rope for?

29:24.162 --> 29:26.963
It may be nothing, or maybe...

29:27.032 --> 29:30.066
Ah ha.
Sir,

29:30.135 --> 29:32.702
have a look at these large metal hooks.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.705
I believe he may have tied a
rope from one end to the other.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.908
Mr Flannery's injuries are very unusual.

29:37.976 --> 29:41.078
I think he may have had
some sort of device

29:41.146 --> 29:43.246
- to restrain him.
- Of course. That's why he

29:43.249 --> 29:46.683
- hit his head and not his chest.
- Exactly.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.852
- Yes, but that would mean...
- He knew he was going to crash.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.754
Flannery was not the intended victim.

29:50.756 --> 29:52.689
Sir, if my suspicions are correct,

29:52.757 --> 29:55.058
Mr Flannery planned this accident.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.508
Sir, do you really think
Flannery would have

30:11.576 --> 30:14.244
crashed his own motorcar
with himself inside of it?

30:14.313 --> 30:16.446
What was his purpose?

30:16.514 --> 30:18.448
Perhaps Mr Dilbert was

30:18.450 --> 30:20.350
- his intended victim all along.
- Me?

30:20.418 --> 30:22.686
Why would anyone want to kill me?

30:22.688 --> 30:25.956
Mr Flannery swerved to avoid a woman

30:26.024 --> 30:27.925
with a pram, putting you in his path.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.627
The mother has since disappeared,

30:30.629 --> 30:32.262
changing her clothes,
and it's likely the pram

30:32.264 --> 30:35.131
- never contained a baby at all.
- So you think

30:35.134 --> 30:37.200
the only reason the pram was
put there was to make him

30:37.269 --> 30:40.036
- turn towards Mr Dilbert?
- But I don't even know Mr Flannery!

30:40.039 --> 30:42.038
Can you think

30:42.107 --> 30:44.107
of anyone at all who
may have wish you harm?

30:44.175 --> 30:47.611
I've done nothing to warrant
such a passionate act,
I can assure you Detective.

30:47.679 --> 30:51.281
I am a simple man,
a mere cog in the machine.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.783
That's what my life has amounted to,

30:53.852 --> 30:56.119
- I regret to say.
- Detective Murdoch,

30:56.187 --> 30:58.788
I didn't find any rope or
belts in the garbage bins.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.624
Would you like me to
look in the receptacles

31:00.659 --> 31:02.426
- further down the street?
- No, thank you, John.

31:02.494 --> 31:05.695
Mr Flannery hasn't left the
intersection since the accident,

31:05.698 --> 31:07.697
it's not likely he went that far.

31:07.766 --> 31:10.300
No, but Sir, if your theory is correct,

31:10.302 --> 31:14.037
he had or has an accomplice.
The woman pushing the pram.

31:14.106 --> 31:17.107
I mean, that's probably
why she stashed the pram

31:17.175 --> 31:18.976
and the orange coat in the alley,
so she could return

31:19.044 --> 31:22.112
- to the scene unrecognized.
- She may have been the one
to remove the restraint.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.514
And if so...

31:24.583 --> 31:26.549
it's possible she's still here.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.852
If she is,

31:28.854 --> 31:31.421
we don't want to give
her reason to flee.

31:31.489 --> 31:33.790
Let's not tip our suspicion

31:33.859 --> 31:36.593
of Mr Flannery until we find her.
Gentlemen, speak

31:36.661 --> 31:39.396
with all of the women that
are still here. See if you

31:39.398 --> 31:42.732
can establish their exact whereabouts
at the time of the collision.

31:42.801 --> 31:45.936
Sir.

31:46.004 --> 31:48.405
Should you like more of this?

31:48.407 --> 31:50.407
Go ahead.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.575
We got him!

31:54.879 --> 31:57.080
Ah!

31:57.148 --> 31:59.082
I thought I was going to have
to leave this one behind.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.751
Good catch,
Miss Cherry.

32:01.820 --> 32:04.821
Summers at my grandmother's
farm haven't gone to waste!

32:04.889 --> 32:07.691
Well, if you'd like to
taste this one's shank,

32:07.759 --> 32:10.694
come to Nicastro's Butcher and
I'll make you get a good cut.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.562
I may take you up on that.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.598
Back in here.

32:18.470 --> 32:22.105
And once again, thank you
for your help, Constable.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.441
No trouble, Artie.
You can be on your way now.

32:24.509 --> 32:26.476
All right,
take care.

32:26.544 --> 32:28.478
Drive safely!

32:28.546 --> 32:31.915
Well, you were right,

32:31.951 --> 32:34.050
Constable Crabtree.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.786
- It's not so bad to lend a hand.
- It was good of you.

32:36.789 --> 32:39.556
Now, what was the name
of the squished man?

32:39.624 --> 32:41.758
Uh...

32:41.826 --> 32:44.127
Thank you.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.329
The precise issue with the
Water Care Incorporated company

32:46.398 --> 32:48.865
is the legitimacy of their
proposed filtration method.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.534
Am I speaking too fast, Miss Ash?

32:51.603 --> 32:53.903
No, I am quite adept at
cross-eclectic shorthand.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.574
Yes, I have had occasion to notice.

33:01.179 --> 33:04.014
As you brought to my attention,
the company has letters

33:04.082 --> 33:06.350
of recommendation from several
small towns. However, I noticed

33:06.418 --> 33:08.485
that the name on one of
the letters did not match

33:08.553 --> 33:11.254
the forms that I had seen from...

33:18.163 --> 33:20.096
All right, Dilton?

33:20.165 --> 33:22.099
Yes.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.236
I see that the ambulance is
here but I am not ready yet.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.304
No rush.
Take your time.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.707
- What time is it, Tom?
- Around 9:40.

33:30.775 --> 33:32.809
- Miss Ash.
- Hm?

33:32.877 --> 33:36.380
I was to meet my immediate
supervisor at 10:15 this morning

33:36.448 --> 33:38.314
- to convey my concerns to him.
- Mhm.

33:38.383 --> 33:40.183
You could attend the
meeting in my stead,

33:40.251 --> 33:43.019
pass along my regrets,

33:43.088 --> 33:46.456
and explain our concerns.
Here are my notes...

33:46.525 --> 33:48.658
No, I will do no such thing, Mr Dilbert.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.928
Well, there's...
time enough for you to do so.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.830
Well, that's entirely beside the point.

33:53.898 --> 33:55.732
Oh.

33:55.801 --> 33:59.869
No, I will see you
safely to the hospital.

34:01.806 --> 34:03.740
There's no need.

34:03.808 --> 34:07.477
It's likely I won't make it to hospital.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.045
Oh, I beg your pardon! Not make it?

34:10.114 --> 34:13.083
The doctor believes that
moving the motorcar back

34:13.150 --> 34:15.018
will kill me.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.190
Oh.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.101
I apologise for the poor timing
of what I am about to say.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.804
What is it,
Mr Dilbert?

34:36.306 --> 34:38.041
I am not sure whether

34:38.077 --> 34:40.342
saying this now is a kindness.

34:40.411 --> 34:43.679
But I must confess to loving you.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.884
Loving you in such a way

34:47.952 --> 34:49.752
that my most cherished wish is...

34:49.821 --> 34:52.789
was to give you comfort

34:52.791 --> 34:55.425
and security for the rest of your life.

34:55.494 --> 34:58.128
I understand.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.730
It is the most inopportune
time and I do apologise,

35:00.732 --> 35:02.799
and I hope you do not feel that
you need to reciprocate...

35:02.868 --> 35:05.235
No. I loved you as well.

35:05.303 --> 35:08.071
Oh.
You have?

35:08.139 --> 35:13.810
Well...

35:15.880 --> 35:18.715
What did you learn about
the Lady tourists?

35:18.783 --> 35:20.917
We can eliminate them.
Mr Todd says he remembers them

35:20.985 --> 35:23.086
all being in the carriage from
the beginning of the tour.

35:23.122 --> 35:26.022
The Germans insisted on a
head count at every stop.

35:26.090 --> 35:27.891
We haven't much time.
What have you, George?

35:27.959 --> 35:30.093
Sir, I learned that Miss Quigg,
the barmaid,

35:30.095 --> 35:32.829
- opened late this morning.
- She told us as much, yes.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.998
So her whereabouts during
the time of the accident

35:35.066 --> 35:36.566
- were unknown.
- She's acquainted

35:36.635 --> 35:38.568
- with Mr Flannery.
- And the pram was hidden

35:38.637 --> 35:40.570
in the alley near enough to the pub.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.739
If Flannery used some sort
of restraining device,

35:42.807 --> 35:44.674
she would have had opportunity
to hide it inside.

35:44.742 --> 35:46.676
I'll investigate motive. Carry on.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.257
Mr Dilbert...

36:00.325 --> 36:02.425
there must be

36:02.427 --> 36:04.427
something you've done

36:04.429 --> 36:06.729
- out of the ordinary recently.
- I've kept quite to my routine.

36:06.798 --> 36:09.232
I assure you, I am not
important enough to murder,

36:09.234 --> 36:11.434
Detective Murdoch.

36:11.502 --> 36:14.137
Perhaps this is simply an accident.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.473
But Mr Dilbert.
You have done something unusual

36:16.541 --> 36:18.508
- as of late.
- I have?

36:18.576 --> 36:21.911
You looked into the Water Care
Incorporated company for me.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.813
That's not part of
your ordinary routine.

36:23.881 --> 36:27.116
No. But it was just a simple
matter of checking references.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.686
Yes, but prior to the
awarding of a city tender.

36:29.754 --> 36:32.355
But for that company,
what you discovered

36:32.357 --> 36:35.124
through your diligent
research was a problem

36:35.193 --> 36:36.993
with their patents.

36:37.061 --> 36:38.895
Their filtration system doesn't
do what they say it will.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.864
And they know as much.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.899
You proved that without a doubt.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.302
It was a small matter of
telephoning the right people.

36:45.370 --> 36:48.238
It will cost them their
municipal contract.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.106
Enough money to murder for.

36:50.108 --> 36:53.109
Who else knew you were
investigating this company?

36:53.111 --> 36:55.779
I spoke with a representative
from the company yesterday

36:55.847 --> 36:58.581
to confirm that they'd submitted
the correct documentation.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.784
Here are my notes on the call.

37:06.357 --> 37:08.325
Thank you,
Mr Dilbert.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.695
Miss Ash.

37:12.764 --> 37:15.498
Now I believe it's high time
we got you out of here.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.137
There is nothing else
to be done, I suppose.

37:21.205 --> 37:24.040
Oh, Mr Dilbert... Dilton.

37:26.944 --> 37:28.878
Mr Dilbert.

37:28.946 --> 37:32.549
I will find the people
responsible for hurting you.

37:35.687 --> 37:38.755
Thank you,
Detective.

37:45.129 --> 37:47.063
- Good man.
- Yes.

37:47.065 --> 37:49.165
Good man.

37:51.235 --> 37:53.703
I'll be assisting the
ambulance attendants.

37:53.705 --> 37:57.106
George, when you move the motorcar back,
be sure to go far enough
to give us room to work.

37:57.109 --> 37:59.375
- Will do.
- When the motorcar is moved,

37:59.444 --> 38:01.444
he'll likely go into hemorrhagic shock.

38:01.446 --> 38:04.147
We'll bind his injuries
as tightly as possible.

38:04.215 --> 38:06.116
And if that is successful, he'll

38:06.184 --> 38:08.785
be transported to the
hospital for surgery.

38:08.853 --> 38:11.421
- He will be in tremendous pain.
- Yes. I have

38:11.489 --> 38:13.589
the morphine ready...

38:13.592 --> 38:15.759
William, it's missing.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.832
The belt.

38:28.773 --> 38:31.708
Harming Miss Ash won't help you,
Nurse Liston.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.676
I beg your pardon!

38:33.679 --> 38:36.413
I was simply going to assist the doctor.

38:39.183 --> 38:41.084
This is the woman that
was pushing the pram.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.086
Of course!
Of course!

38:43.154 --> 38:46.356
I recognize her, Detective.

38:46.358 --> 38:49.125
She did this! She is a jilted lover.

38:49.193 --> 38:51.327
Angry enough to try to hurt me.

38:51.396 --> 38:54.630
- You bastard.
- You! Hurting this poor,

38:54.699 --> 38:57.300
- innocent man.
- Mr Flannery,

38:57.369 --> 39:00.136
Miss Liston likely had an accomplice.

39:00.204 --> 39:03.573
And I suspect we'll find
that you are a principal

39:03.575 --> 39:05.508
at the Water Care Incorporated Company.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.377
You found out

39:07.445 --> 39:09.813
that Mr Dilbert had information
that could cost you

39:09.881 --> 39:12.448
- a city contract.
- A loss big enough

39:12.451 --> 39:13.950
to bankrupt your company, I'll wager.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.319
- What!
- So you learned

39:16.387 --> 39:18.321
Mr Dilbert's routine.
You and Miss Liston

39:18.323 --> 39:20.123
set about to prevent him

39:20.191 --> 39:22.091
from telling anyone what he'd learned.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.260
She pushed the pram
into the intersection,

39:24.328 --> 39:26.262
giving you the excuse you needed

39:26.330 --> 39:28.331
to do what you intended all along:

39:28.400 --> 39:30.567
to hit Mr Dilbert with your motorcar.

39:33.237 --> 39:35.138
That's ridiculous.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.573
You said yourself the
brakes were sabotaged.

39:37.642 --> 39:40.276
- You cut them, sunshine.
- That's why you knew

39:40.345 --> 39:42.445
to wear a restraint.
Miss Liston then

39:42.513 --> 39:44.680
returned to the scene and
helped you get rid of it.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.583
I suspect we'll find marks

39:46.651 --> 39:48.418
on this belt matching the metal hooks

39:48.486 --> 39:50.319
behind the seat of your motorcar.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.989
No! It was an accident.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.658
I highly doubt that.
Take them away.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.302
Right.

40:06.370 --> 40:08.271
It's time.

40:18.549 --> 40:20.450
- Well, Mr Dilbert.
- Were those the people

40:20.518 --> 40:22.318
responsible for the accident?

40:22.387 --> 40:24.821
The Detective has them bang to rights.

40:24.823 --> 40:27.924
Dilton, I am so sorry
I got you into this.

40:27.992 --> 40:29.926
If I hadn't asked you for your help...

40:29.994 --> 40:33.496
We did the right thing, Mildred.

40:33.564 --> 40:36.933
That's all that matters,
what... whatever happens.

40:37.001 --> 40:39.869
We saved the city and its
citizens from a con artist.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.376
We'd best not put this off any longer.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.680
It is my hope...

40:50.748 --> 40:52.648
We are going to do

40:52.717 --> 40:54.650
our very best, Mr Dilbert.

40:54.719 --> 40:56.686
Thank you.

41:00.324 --> 41:02.091
You've been a good friend, Tom.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.893
We'll get you out of there, Dilton.

41:03.961 --> 41:07.363
I'll be here to support your
weight when the car moves.

41:07.432 --> 41:10.900
And I'll be right here.

41:24.649 --> 41:27.116
I have imagined our
courtship so many times.

41:27.184 --> 41:28.918
As have I.

41:28.954 --> 41:31.421
It's almost as if it really happened.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.632
I am ready.

41:46.037 --> 41:49.339
Ready.
Go.

41:49.407 --> 41:51.440
- Push!
- Hang in there!

41:57.015 --> 41:58.948
Give it here, lads.

42:47.665 --> 42:49.465
Oh,
no!
