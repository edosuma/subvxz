00:09.676 --> 00:11.553


00:11.636 --> 00:14.055


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:26.067 --> 00:29.696


00:32.115 --> 00:34.242


00:34.325 --> 00:37.454


00:38.163 --> 00:40.540


00:42.042 --> 00:43.752
Whee!

00:43.835 --> 00:45.670
Whoa!

00:45.754 --> 00:47.297
Unh!

00:48.381 --> 00:49.716
Come on, cheeple!

00:49.799 --> 00:51.342
-This isn't rocket surgery!

00:51.426 --> 00:53.720
We gotta hit them before they hit us.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.181
Let's play Dodgebird!

00:58.183 --> 01:00.060


01:00.143 --> 01:03.313
Hey, Blue birds! Hope you like
chewing on hatchling feathers

01:03.396 --> 01:06.191
because I got an
all-you-can-eat buffet for you.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.359
Whoa! Pump the brakes, Stella.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.236
These kids are in first grade.

01:10.737 --> 01:15.158
Well, lucky for them Professor Stella's
here to teach them a valuable lesson.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.701
Class in session!

01:16.785 --> 01:18.078
Who's with me?

01:18.161 --> 01:19.245
I am, I am, I am!

01:20.121 --> 01:21.915
And I got some sweet, sweet moves!

01:22.415 --> 01:23.666
Ooh, watch me shimmy!

01:24.375 --> 01:27.378
Watch me dazzle! Watch me-- Ow!

01:28.671 --> 01:31.174
-Out, out and--

01:31.257 --> 01:33.301
Ow, ow, ow!
So much pain.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.887
Open wide and say, "Ahh," birdies!

01:35.970 --> 01:37.180
-Dinner's ready!

01:38.890 --> 01:41.059
Wow, we may actually win for-- Unh!

01:44.938 --> 01:47.482
-And you are out!

01:47.565 --> 01:50.527
Team Itty-Bitty Bluebirds wins.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.113
-Oh, come on!

01:57.200 --> 02:00.578
Aww, don't be sad.
You'll still get to go to the finals.

02:00.662 --> 02:04.749
I mean, you'll be in the stands
watching my team win, but you'll be there.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.460
Ooh! That burn was unwell.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.962
Do you mean sick burn?

02:09.045 --> 02:11.381
Yeah, that's it. Sick burn!

02:11.464 --> 02:12.924
Thanks, coach.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.676
We'll see you in the finals.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.761
On the court, beak-to-beak.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.222
Yeah, beak-to-beak, face-to-face.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.684
Head-to-shoulders, knees and toes,
knees and toes--

02:22.767 --> 02:24.102
Team meeting.

02:24.185 --> 02:29.065
I'm the captain of this team
and I do not lose ever!

02:29.149 --> 02:31.776
And if we're on the same team, we do not--

02:31.860 --> 02:34.487
-Shower?
-Lose, Chuck! We do not lose!

02:34.571 --> 02:38.032
But you definitely
need to shower, like now.

02:39.742 --> 02:43.913
I know you love winning, Stella,
but losing is way easier.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.416
Look. I have one rule.

02:46.499 --> 02:50.420
Shower. I get it. I heard you
loud and clear before. Jeez!

02:50.503 --> 02:54.632
No, Chuck, you do whatever it takes
to win, no matter the cost.

02:55.216 --> 02:58.386
And if we had a real coach
instead of Mighty Eagle,

02:58.469 --> 02:59.721
he'd say the same.

02:59.804 --> 03:02.557
Oh, coach!

03:02.640 --> 03:05.268
I thought the schedule said couch!

03:05.351 --> 03:07.145
It is real comfy.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.606
Gonna be hard
getting me off this thing now.

03:09.689 --> 03:14.193
If we lose one more time,
we're out of the tournament

03:14.277 --> 03:17.780
and the look on Robin's smug beak
will haunt me forever.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.867
You know who you should get to coach you?
Harold.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.077
What Harold? The Harold?

03:23.161 --> 03:27.498
Yeah, you know, little guy, bald,
completely beaten down by life.

03:27.582 --> 03:31.002
I mean, he was
the greatest Dodgebird champion

03:31.085 --> 03:32.795
in the history
of Camp Splinterwood.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.964
Hmm.

03:38.676 --> 03:42.180
Coach your Dodgebird team?
Oh, no can doodly I'm afraid.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.848
But you were a winner.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.391
Exactly. I was. Yeah.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.269
That's why I can't coach you.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.938
That makes zero sense.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.523
If you coach us,
we can win the tournament!

03:55.068 --> 03:59.030
No doubt. But Lynette coaches
Robin's team and they always win.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.448
Lynette loves winning.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.243
Only thing she loves
more than winning is--

04:03.326 --> 04:05.912
-You?
-Oh, gosh no, trophies!

04:05.995 --> 04:07.914
Has a wall of them in her cabin,

04:07.997 --> 04:11.376
and she's expecting to add to it
after the tournament.

04:11.459 --> 04:14.879
She'd bend my beak if I dared
compete against her. No thanks!

04:16.464 --> 04:18.383
-Hey, Harold!

04:18.466 --> 04:21.469
-I'm not giving up. Dodgebirds don't quit.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.933
-Huh? Huh huh?

04:27.016 --> 04:28.601
Mm-mm-mm.

04:30.728 --> 04:32.355
Ohh!

04:32.438 --> 04:34.857
Huh? Huh? Huh?

04:38.486 --> 04:39.988
Mm-mm.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.201
-Huh? Huh? Huh?
-Ohh!

04:45.785 --> 04:47.203
Huh?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.959
Whoa! Was that you?

04:53.042 --> 04:55.753
Yeah.
That was me.

04:55.837 --> 04:59.382
Ohh! I come back to
my old clubhouse sometimes and--

04:59.465 --> 05:02.218
To remember how good
winning that trophy felt?

05:02.302 --> 05:05.263
To remember the sound of the crowd
cheering for you?

05:09.017 --> 05:13.271
Ooh. Winning that tournament
was the best day of my life.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.481
Coach us, Harold. You can win it again.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.651
You can have another trophy.
Another best day.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.154
Just listen to the crowd.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.410
Harold! Harold!

05:27.493 --> 05:30.038
Quit it! No, don't!
I'm tellin you I can't--

05:30.121 --> 05:31.497
Oh, fine! I'll do it!

05:31.581 --> 05:33.041
Yes!

05:33.124 --> 05:35.585
You want to win the Dodgebird tournament?

05:35.668 --> 05:37.253
Well, winning costs!

05:37.337 --> 05:40.465
And right here is where you start payin'!

05:40.548 --> 05:41.591
In sweat!

05:41.674 --> 05:43.301
I just showered!

05:43.384 --> 05:47.513
If you want to win,
you have to be the hatchlings!

05:47.597 --> 05:50.183
You must become one with the ball.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.559
Now load up!

05:55.897 --> 05:57.190
Whoo!

05:57.273 --> 05:59.650
-Yeah! Keep it up!

05:59.734 --> 06:00.860
Way to go, guys!

06:11.245 --> 06:12.163
-You're ready!

06:12.246 --> 06:14.540
I've taught you everything I know.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.794
Wow, really?
That only took like 14 seconds.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.045
Oh, it's on.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.021
You're out!

06:47.949 --> 06:51.410
You did it, Harold! You got us to--

06:51.494 --> 06:53.621
The finals. I sure did!

06:53.704 --> 06:56.249
That's what winners do!

06:56.332 --> 06:59.919
Ooh, I am so glad
you and your loser team made it.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.839
It's gonna be so much fun
kicking your butt feathers!

07:02.922 --> 07:04.841
That's my trophy, Harold!

07:04.924 --> 07:07.260
If you were smart,
you'd quit right now.

07:07.343 --> 07:10.346
Well, you know me, cuddle bug.
Not very smart.

07:10.429 --> 07:13.057
Too bad because if your team beats mine,

07:13.141 --> 07:17.645
you're looking for another camp
to work at, as in bye-bye.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.605
You can't coach us, Harold.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.151
But it's like you said,
winners win no matter the cost.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.487
But when the cost is your job,
your home, your marriage?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.531
Lynette said she'd "bye-bye" you!

07:28.614 --> 07:32.493
Dodgebirds don't quit
and I am 1000% Dodgebird.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.541
Let's get ready to play Dodgebird!

07:40.793 --> 07:42.670
Guys, we have to lose the game.

07:42.753 --> 07:45.089
If we win, Lynette will fire Harold.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.550
He'll have to leave camp. We gotta lose.

07:47.633 --> 07:51.095
You heard her, boys.
Let's stink this place up.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.224
Oh! Whoa!

07:59.937 --> 08:03.191
Harold trained us too well!
Losing is gonna be impossible!

08:08.362 --> 08:10.823
Oh, that's it. You're going down!

08:11.657 --> 08:14.327
Sorry. We're really trying to lose here.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.955
Don't worry, cheeple. I got you.

08:24.086 --> 08:27.798
Chuck, Bomb, Red! You're out!

08:29.217 --> 08:32.178
Um, what are you celebrating for?
You're throwing the game.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.930
-Yep!
-Time out.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.641
I'm pulling Stella
and replacing her with me.

08:36.724 --> 08:38.476
What? He's not allowed to do that!

08:39.227 --> 08:40.728
It's in the rules.

08:40.811 --> 08:45.024
Then I pull my team
and replace them with me!

08:45.107 --> 08:47.735
-Huh?!
-Sudden death! Game on!

08:48.945 --> 08:51.447
This is the dumbest game
of Dodgebird ever.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.993
Don't do it, Harold. It's not worth it!

08:56.077 --> 08:57.495
She's right.

09:13.844 --> 09:14.845
What's he doing?

09:35.157 --> 09:38.160
Be the hatchling.
Be the hatchling.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.621
He's becoming one with the ball.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.710
No!

09:53.342 --> 09:55.720
You're out! Harold wins!

09:58.848 --> 09:59.849
Whoo!

10:01.851 --> 10:03.060
Oh, birdfeed.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.270
Harold!

10:05.229 --> 10:07.732
-You didn't listen to me.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.151
You just had to win, didn't you?

10:10.234 --> 10:11.944
-I have never seen

10:12.028 --> 10:14.196
this side of you before.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.825
I like it.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.538
Ugh!

10:22.622 --> 10:23.831
Eww!

10:23.914 --> 10:25.458
Ohh!

10:26.292 --> 10:28.502
Harold, I just want to say that I really--

10:28.586 --> 10:31.213
-Harold!
-Mmm mmm mmm!

10:31.297 --> 10:33.966
Oh, okay, I get it.
This isn't about Dodgebird anymore.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.384
I'll check back in later!

10:35.468 --> 10:36.969
Harold!
