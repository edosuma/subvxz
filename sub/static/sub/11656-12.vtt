AKU: Long ago, in a distant land,

00:04.631 --> 00:09.344
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.427 --> 00:12.722
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.181 --> 00:18.561
But a foolish Samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword

00:18.645 --> 00:21.314
Stepped forth to oppose me.

Before the final blow
was struck,

00:26.778 --> 00:29.322
I tore open a portal in time,

00:29.405 --> 00:31.366
and flung him into the future,

00:31.449 --> 00:33.660
where my evil is law.

00:34.244 --> 00:38.331
Now the fool seeks to return
to the past

00:38.414 --> 00:43.211
and undo the future that is Aku.
