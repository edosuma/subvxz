WEBVTT

00:06.590 --> 00:10.802
Who do you trust with your deepest hurts?

00:11.595 --> 00:13.764
Your most painful truths?

00:14.765 --> 00:19.811
Friends? Partners? Family?

00:21.271 --> 00:23.607
And what would you do if you found out

00:23.690 --> 00:27.319
that your most trusted ally
was lying to you?

00:27.819 --> 00:30.697
That's exactly what happened
to Micah Keith.

00:31.573 --> 00:35.702
In episode two,
we uncovered the shocking revelation

00:35.786 --> 00:39.206
that Drew Turney was not
Joshua Keith's lover.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.875
He was his son.

00:43.377 --> 00:47.256
That discovery only left us
with more questions.

00:47.339 --> 00:50.717
How did they find each other
after all these years?

00:50.801 --> 00:53.595
Why did they keep
their relationship a secret?

00:54.471 --> 01:00.102
And what, if anything,
did that have to do with their deaths?

01:01.728 --> 01:05.315
And that's a cut. We are clear.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.441
Okay.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.946
Can you see if Alana Cave's attorneys
have reached out

01:11.029 --> 01:13.699
to anyone else from the Cave story?

01:13.782 --> 01:15.158
Yeah. I'm on it.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.743
All right. Night, Poppy.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.861
Surely, you know
that man's blood is on your hands?

02:32.945 --> 02:36.490
No one else but you.
You drove Owen Cave to end his life.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.117
I didn't drive him to break into my house.

02:39.201 --> 02:42.913
I didn't drive him to threaten
and assault me.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.834
But you admit that your podcast
drove him to kill himself?

02:46.917 --> 02:48.794
I do not admit that, no.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.798
He was the one in control.
He was holding a gun to my head.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.303
Not bad.

02:59.638 --> 03:03.976
Those are the kinds of questions you can
expect from Alana's opposing counsel.

03:04.059 --> 03:09.022
You did well, but you gotta keep cool.
All right?

03:09.523 --> 03:12.025
Anger is red meat to wolves.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.861
Okay.

03:16.113 --> 03:19.408
So, what are my chances? Truthfully.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.911
Well, we have a good chance
of getting Alana's claims

03:22.995 --> 03:25.789
of wrongful death
and cyberbullying dismissed.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.709
The intentional infliction
of emotional distress,

03:28.792 --> 03:32.004
that's more problematic.

03:32.087 --> 03:35.215
-Why?
-Because it comes down to intent.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.845
I mean, it could be a fight. A big one.

03:39.928 --> 03:45.058
They're gonna be listening this season,
and they're listening for slipups,

03:45.142 --> 03:49.897
so you have to be extra careful
how you handle the Joshua story.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.358
Especially now that
the police have reopened the case.

03:53.442 --> 03:56.153
Well, that didn't scare me.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.364
Just don't give them ammunition.
That's all I'm saying.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.994
Are we too old to pinky swear?

04:05.162 --> 04:06.496
I ain't too old for shit.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.790
You ain't too old for shit.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.296
I got a date. You know, happy hour.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.507
I'll be back early if he sucks.
Next week if he doesn't.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.135
-Be safe.
-Always, Brother Ingram.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.345
I'm out.

04:25.516 --> 04:29.311
I think... I should head out too.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.981
What are we waiting for exactly?

04:34.441 --> 04:39.404
We spent six months starting from scratch.
Finding our way back to each other.

04:40.364 --> 04:41.698
You think we're there?

04:43.659 --> 04:44.785
Don't you?

04:47.037 --> 04:49.665
Let's get through the deposition.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.334
What difference will that make?

04:54.753 --> 04:59.466
I wanna see if there's anything
that will come up that I don't know.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.848
You think I'm keeping something from you?
Still?

05:05.931 --> 05:11.520
I wanna say no, Pop,
but... experience taught me different.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.272
Ouch.

05:14.523 --> 05:17.818
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that to hurt.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.528
Then stay.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.411
I'll call you when I get
back to my apartment.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.052
Well, thanks for sitting down with us.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.512
Let's start with your name?

05:47.181 --> 05:50.058
Lukather Shreveport Scoville.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.312
Call me Shreve.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.272
So what we talking about today?

05:56.315 --> 05:58.525
Manhood. Masculinity.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.153
Small things then?

06:01.236 --> 06:02.946
How would you define manhood?

06:07.868 --> 06:10.329
The definition in my mind is...

06:13.081 --> 06:15.501
my brother, Noble.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.462
My older brother.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.132
Black men of me and Noble's generation...

06:24.426 --> 06:30.349
Racism and manhood...
went hand in hand like puzzle pieces.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.228
It broke us into two separate people.

06:35.354 --> 06:38.190
Black men had to fold themselves in
when they left the house

06:38.273 --> 06:41.693
and wait to expand their chests
when they got home.

06:43.779 --> 06:44.905
I didn't do that.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.158
What do you mean?

06:50.619 --> 06:51.662
Peep this.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.835
How many times you watch
some fictional shit on TV or movies,

06:57.918 --> 07:02.506
and Black people are running and hiding,
cowering and crying?

07:04.508 --> 07:06.051
Not everybody did that.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.096
Black people fought the fuck back.

07:10.055 --> 07:14.351
You'd be a fool to believe they didn't.
It's human nature. Always have.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.523
Whether you believed it or not,
or whether you'd seen it or not.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.234
I've never once heard him talk like that.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.737
Guess he wanted to
record his life before...

07:25.821 --> 07:27.114
He forgets it.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.873
You take this home. There's a lot more.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.292
Thanks.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.216
I found these too.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.723
They look alike.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.685
They even have the same mannerisms.

07:58.103 --> 08:02.566
I would have welcomed
any child of his in any form.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.032
Why don't I look into Drew?

08:12.034 --> 08:13.577
If you think it'll help the case.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.370
Possibly.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.374
Would it help you too?

08:23.003 --> 08:26.256
I mean, he's a part of who Josh is.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.929
Maybe I'll get answers there.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.104
-There they are. My brothers.
-Hey, Markus.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.397
Herbie.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.608
-Always good to see you, son.
-Long time.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.861
Hey, don't be no stranger.

08:47.945 --> 08:51.073
I know, I know. I've been busy.
I'm taking care of my business.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.534
-I'm handling mine.
-All right, son. All right.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.118
-My man, Herbie.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.037
-Good looking out, brother.
-You got takeout in the back.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.163
-I'll go get it.
-No rush.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.957
Is that Markus special ready?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.083
How you doing?

09:06.088 --> 09:07.381
Markus Killebrew?

09:08.465 --> 09:09.550
Yeah, that's right.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.762
You played football
at Tech back in the day?

09:13.846 --> 09:14.847
Wow.

09:14.930 --> 09:17.266
I haven't heard anybody talk
about that in about 15 years.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.851
But yes, yes, I did.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.728
I used to cheer for you.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.522
What? Get outta here.

09:24.106 --> 09:25.566
Charise Spivey.

09:27.526 --> 09:30.654
I know. I don't look the same--

09:30.737 --> 09:33.115
Nah, you look fine, girl.
Come here, give me some love.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.324
It's been a minute.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.243
Couple decades, a matter of fact.

09:37.995 --> 09:40.414
So what's happening?
You just came from work?

09:41.707 --> 09:43.166
Not exactly.

09:57.306 --> 10:02.269
She... went missing almost a year ago.

10:02.853 --> 10:06.023
She was last seen
across the street at Bushrod.

10:06.607 --> 10:10.110
You know, I used to be OPD?
What did the police say?

10:10.611 --> 10:13.530
They never even really tried
to look for her.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.368
So I've been doing it on my own mostly.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.832
I was sorry to hear about your daughter.

10:25.334 --> 10:29.087
Capstones's on the streets.
If they hear anything, they come to me.

10:29.922 --> 10:30.923
Thank you.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.719
-I appreciate it.
-Do you have any more of these flyers?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.182
You know, as matter of fact,

10:40.265 --> 10:42.559
can you give me a copy
of everything that you have?

10:43.477 --> 10:44.561
I'll look into it.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.105
Here you go, fam.

10:47.189 --> 10:48.732
-Thanks, bro.
-Yeah.

10:49.733 --> 10:50.901
Got you.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.528
Listen to me.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.906
You keep your head up.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.741
All right?

10:58.659 --> 10:59.910
And I'll be in touch.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.831
-All right, son.
-All right.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.093
Yep. That's him.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.178
I'd already clocked out
when I spotted the fool.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.847
He really tried to press me.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.348
And who was this again?

11:21.890 --> 11:24.184
The passenger who made
sexual advances at me

11:24.268 --> 11:28.063
while trespassing on company property
when I was all alone in the depot.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.189
Better?

11:29.273 --> 11:31.817
Yes. We're doing all we can do, just--

11:31.900 --> 11:33.610
Yeah, you have a blessed night, sis.

11:37.072 --> 11:40.409
Swear supervisors act like
they forgot what it is to be on the route.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.077
What happened?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.872
The other day, this dude came
on my bus and just--

11:46.039 --> 11:47.040
Shit.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.502
Why the cute ones got to be crazy?

11:54.464 --> 11:56.133
You can do better.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.093
Why? 'Cause he doesn't have a car?

11:58.177 --> 12:00.888
No, because baths
and combs are not his friend.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.435
You rude.

12:07.728 --> 12:08.854
Okay.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.440
Keep calling city hall.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.275
If we don't stop it,

12:13.358 --> 12:15.527
this neighborhood won't exist
for us anymore.

12:16.028 --> 12:20.449
That condo development
on Alcatraz is already six stories high.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.952
Now, that's done,
but we can stop the next one.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.037
That's right.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.915
Stay vigilant,
and I'll see you all next month.

12:27.998 --> 12:28.999
Yeah.

12:39.885 --> 12:42.429
Charise? Desiree.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.431
My father told me about Drea.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.684
Hold on... Officer Quezado?

12:50.521 --> 12:51.522
Excuse me.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.235
Officer Quezado.

12:56.318 --> 12:59.196
It's... Nando.

12:59.696 --> 13:00.697
Nando.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.534
This is Charise Spivey.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.871
Her daughter, Drea, went missing...
six months ago?

13:07.955 --> 13:09.289
Almost a year.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.086
Tell me about your daughter.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.256
So, this is Drea.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.331
Ramon?

14:34.291 --> 14:35.334
Ramon?

14:35.834 --> 14:38.337
Can you get the rest of the shoes
from upstairs?

14:39.922 --> 14:40.923
Ramon?

14:44.009 --> 14:45.594
Hey, Ramon.

14:47.346 --> 14:48.764
What's going on with you?

14:48.847 --> 14:49.848
Nothing.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.144
I'm fine.

14:58.273 --> 15:01.109
Can you go upstairs and get the rest of
the shoes and meet me at Bayview?

15:01.193 --> 15:02.736
I have to meet my sponsor kids.

15:29.805 --> 15:31.056
What you doing? Sleeping?

15:37.771 --> 15:39.398
Okay.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.692
Interrupt anxiety with gratitude.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.528
-Yo, turn that up.
-Interrupt anxiety with gratitude.

15:47.573 --> 15:48.574
Oh, shit.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.755
Too high, man.

16:03.839 --> 16:04.840
Hey!

16:06.466 --> 16:07.593
Who's a size 11?

16:09.011 --> 16:10.012
Come on. Come on.

16:25.277 --> 16:29.948
Hey, that missing girl, Drea,
she's from your school.

16:30.824 --> 16:31.867
Did you know her?

16:32.367 --> 16:34.119
-Trini!
-What?

16:34.203 --> 16:35.495
"What?"

16:37.581 --> 16:39.750
I'm sorry. Yes, Daddy?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.418
Can you put your phone down, please?

16:45.631 --> 16:46.757
All right.

16:56.600 --> 17:01.188
So last night when I picked up dinner,
I ran into Drea's mother.

17:02.439 --> 17:03.482
Did you know her?

17:04.148 --> 17:05.651
No, not really.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.986
She's a junior in continuation, Dad.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.196
Everyone at school thinks
she just ran away.

17:19.665 --> 17:23.085
Who in the hell could have so much
to say at 6:30 in the morning, huh?

17:24.545 --> 17:27.339
-You on phone with some knucklehead boy?
-And what if it is?

17:29.800 --> 17:32.845
Well, if it is, then I want you
to bring Eddie Haskell home to meet me.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.180
Who?

17:35.681 --> 17:36.974
Never mind.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.684
Okay, can I have my phone back, please?

17:41.270 --> 17:42.604
Thank you.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.983
I will see you after school.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.610
-Be safe.
-Bye. Love you, Daddy.

17:48.694 --> 17:49.903
I love you too, baby.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.045
-This looks great.
-It's getting there.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.631
I like this one. What does this say?

19:32.714 --> 19:34.633
-All colors are beautiful.
-Yeah, they are.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.260
Yep. That's right.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.012
-I think this is very pretty.
-Thank you.

19:39.096 --> 19:42.140
Daisies and bees.
That's a very happy chair.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.309
My favorite flower and favorite insect.

19:44.393 --> 19:46.895
M.K., how much you think
I could sell this one for?

19:46.979 --> 19:50.899
You'll get a lot more for
those Air Force 1s that you just copped.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.695
-Don't wear 'em, sell 'em.
-Okay.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.447
That's right.

19:59.741 --> 20:00.742
Well.

20:01.660 --> 20:06.957
Once you guys have completed 50 chairs,
we'll set up a fundraiser.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.960
Sell them at auction for $300?

20:10.043 --> 20:11.545
Yes!

20:11.628 --> 20:13.005
Damn, people will pay all that?

20:13.088 --> 20:15.007
Guilty liberals even more.

20:15.507 --> 20:17.509
-White people, right?
-Mostly.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.516
I'm sorry about Joshua.
He was a cool motherfucker.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.436
Yeah, he was.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.396
Thank you.

20:38.906 --> 20:40.908
Sorry I'm late. Traffic.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.077
-Hong Kong milk tea.
-It's perfect. Just what I needed.

20:44.995 --> 20:46.288
See you back at the office.

20:47.122 --> 20:50.250
Hey. Will you come sit with me?

20:50.334 --> 20:52.252
I have to head back to Shelter.

20:52.336 --> 20:53.337
Come.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.298
Sit there.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.390
I know you're in pain.

21:06.683 --> 21:09.353
I know what it's like
when you're deflecting and repressing.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.230
I'm fine. Really.

21:11.313 --> 21:15.067
You don't have to protect me
from your feelings, whatever they are.

21:15.651 --> 21:17.694
And you don't have to be
scared of my reaction.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.071
I'm not.

21:20.489 --> 21:23.200
M.K. This is tight.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.077
Let's start this one at 2000.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.916
You see, you were just like him
when I first found you.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.503
All bluster and noise to hide the hurt.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.008
You know what
I've been thinking about a lot?

21:40.759 --> 21:42.219
That night in Marrakech.

21:42.302 --> 21:46.056
That fabulous rooftop dinner.

21:46.682 --> 21:48.350
-Do you remember?
-Yeah.

21:49.101 --> 21:52.938
I went to bed early,
and you and Joshua stayed up.

21:53.021 --> 21:57.442
He told me you talked... till the sunrise.

22:01.071 --> 22:07.160
Something definitely changed
when we got back from that trip.

22:09.037 --> 22:12.624
No, no, no.
Nothing was going on between Joshua and I.

22:12.708 --> 22:13.709
Nothing.

22:17.838 --> 22:19.173
Did you want there to be?

22:19.256 --> 22:20.716
No. I--

22:22.885 --> 22:24.761
You got it all wrong, okay?

22:25.762 --> 22:27.598
I could never do anything to hurt you.

22:28.682 --> 22:29.683
I swear.

22:33.145 --> 22:36.565
You're the closest thing
I've ever had to a mother, so--

22:43.864 --> 22:44.990
Sweetie.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.745
I miss him so much.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.247
Me too.

22:53.207 --> 22:55.918
And I really don't like
when people lie to me.

23:02.132 --> 23:03.467
-Hi.
-Hey.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.177
So I looked into our old friends.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.804
No surprise,
Josie has completely disappeared.

23:09.097 --> 23:12.851
Lanie, of course, is still in jail.
Good riddance.

23:13.393 --> 23:16.688
No word from Lanie's husband, Alex.
Poor guy's being foreclosed.

23:16.772 --> 23:18.774
I'll do a drive-by later.

23:18.857 --> 23:20.150
And I got the--

23:21.568 --> 23:23.695
I got the guest book from Drew's funeral.

23:23.779 --> 23:26.615
They ID'd his friends.
Gonna start running them down.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.078
This is good. A lot of names.

23:31.161 --> 23:32.454
Yeah.

23:35.082 --> 23:36.458
"Leana Parker."

23:38.001 --> 23:40.379
Leana Parker, Leana Parker...

23:40.921 --> 23:45.884
I know that name. From Josh.
Back when we were at the Times.

23:46.552 --> 23:48.595
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

23:49.847 --> 23:50.889
Okay.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.273
"North Hampton-based visual artist."

24:00.232 --> 24:01.525
Okay, here we go.

24:01.608 --> 24:05.279
"Started as an assistant
at the photo department in the Times.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.655
Early aughts."

24:07.698 --> 24:09.283
And how old was Drew?

24:09.783 --> 24:10.993
Nineteen.

24:22.796 --> 24:23.797
Hey.

24:23.881 --> 24:26.967
I think I found Drew's mom.

24:27.050 --> 24:30.846
She worked at the Times with Josh,
but before you guys got together.

24:30.929 --> 24:32.389
Well, I wanna meet her.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.349
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

24:34.433 --> 24:36.810
-Okay, I'll reach out to her.
-Okay.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.066
There we go.

24:43.150 --> 24:45.068
-Can I get you anything?
-No, I'm fine.

24:45.694 --> 24:47.070
Shea, can you take notes?

24:49.865 --> 24:53.410
Micah tested
as authentic and radically vulnerable,

24:53.493 --> 24:55.621
which are two key wellness moneymakers.

24:55.704 --> 24:59.541
Engagement is up across all platforms,

24:59.625 --> 25:01.752
so let's take advantage of the time

25:01.835 --> 25:03.795
that we have right now
to build that momentum.

25:03.879 --> 25:05.172
...to expect anything from anyone.

25:05.255 --> 25:08.842
I didn't do that to drive traffic.
I had a real moment of vulnerability.

25:08.926 --> 25:13.096
That worked in our favor.
It resonated because it was real.

25:13.180 --> 25:14.973
Why am I at work so soon?

25:16.558 --> 25:22.231
Couldn't we have had this meeting
on a phone or by email?

25:22.314 --> 25:23.482
No.

25:23.565 --> 25:27.236
Because the new investors will pull out
if you don't keep your shit together.

25:27.319 --> 25:30.489
Money, money. It's all you think about.

25:36.787 --> 25:37.788
Are you two fucking?

25:39.206 --> 25:40.749
Would you give us a moment, please?

25:41.250 --> 25:42.251
Thank you.

25:45.796 --> 25:47.089
Why would you ask that?

25:47.172 --> 25:48.465
Why didn't you answer the question?

25:48.549 --> 25:51.051
-Because the answer is no.
-And it's none of your business.

25:51.134 --> 25:55.055
It's all my business.
You need to remember that, Lachlan.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.139
Listen, Micah--

25:56.223 --> 25:59.893
You listen.
Don't mistake my kindness for weakness.

25:59.977 --> 26:02.396
One call, I can have you
removed from the board.

26:02.479 --> 26:05.315
I think we're just--
We're all a little raw right now.

26:05.399 --> 26:06.400
Are we?

26:07.651 --> 26:09.903
I can't be here right now. I'm leaving.

26:25.961 --> 26:27.004
Can I help you?

26:29.548 --> 26:32.467
If you're here about the house,
you gotta go through the bank.

26:33.010 --> 26:34.178
No, I'm--

26:34.678 --> 26:35.762
You're what?

26:36.597 --> 26:38.056
I'm sorry.

26:38.140 --> 26:41.935
I'm sorry. Yeah, I was just--
I was driving by, and I saw the sign.

26:43.187 --> 26:44.396
It's a great house.

26:44.980 --> 26:46.106
It was.

26:47.274 --> 26:48.734
How do you like the neighborhood?

26:48.817 --> 26:52.863
I don't mean to be rude,
but I'm losing my house.

26:52.946 --> 26:56.033
I'm not selling it. So, you know...

26:56.116 --> 26:58.577
-Get the hell off my lawn?
-Yeah, something like that.

26:59.453 --> 27:01.496
Okay. Well, good luck.

27:01.580 --> 27:02.664
Thank you.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.015
Okay.

27:24.436 --> 27:28.398
I never thought of myself
as the office-affair type.

27:29.775 --> 27:31.527
How long did you and Josh date?

27:31.610 --> 27:35.280
It wasn't really dating.
We enjoyed each other.

27:36.323 --> 27:37.699
An entanglement?

27:41.537 --> 27:44.206
He was in Beijing
when I found out I was pregnant.

27:44.289 --> 27:45.999
Well, did you ever tell him?

27:46.083 --> 27:47.709
By the time he got back from China...

27:49.962 --> 27:52.965
We'd met in Shanghai.

27:54.174 --> 27:57.010
I couldn't bring myself
to tell Josh about the baby,

27:57.761 --> 28:00.097
so I put him up for adoption.

28:00.180 --> 28:01.515
You stay in touch?

28:01.598 --> 28:03.559
Not until Drew found me.

28:04.685 --> 28:09.982
I reached out to explain myself,
but he never returned the call.

28:10.566 --> 28:12.484
Did your boys ever get to meet?

28:12.568 --> 28:14.152
Just on the phone.

28:15.529 --> 28:18.031
I wanted Tim to know he had a big brother.

28:19.658 --> 28:22.661
I took a screenshot
from our last FaceTime.

28:25.664 --> 28:29.126
He has my grandfather's smile,
and I wanted him to see.

28:33.255 --> 28:34.339
May I?

28:34.840 --> 28:36.216
What is it?

28:37.301 --> 28:40.220
It looks like Shelter housing.

28:40.304 --> 28:41.972
It's Ramon's apartment.

28:42.055 --> 28:44.057
He said he was at his boyfriend's place.

28:49.938 --> 28:51.273
Thank you.

29:24.473 --> 29:26.517
Hey, hey, hey. Hold on, hold on.

29:28.894 --> 29:29.895
You good?

29:30.938 --> 29:33.232
My boss thinks
I was fucking her dead husband.

29:34.024 --> 29:35.359
How's that for a good morning?

29:35.984 --> 29:37.152
Were you?

29:38.362 --> 29:39.947
He didn't like dick, trust me.

29:41.323 --> 29:42.324
Memento?

29:44.284 --> 29:45.869
My ex spilled the wine on it.

29:46.995 --> 29:48.830
I'm taking it to the dry cleaner.

29:49.957 --> 29:50.958
Bad breakup, huh?

29:52.835 --> 29:54.002
You could say that.

30:28.161 --> 30:30.163
Ramon and Drew?

30:30.664 --> 30:33.500
Apparently, there was
an ugly breakup a few weeks ago.

30:34.084 --> 30:36.503
Maybe Ramon thought Drew was seeing Josh.

30:38.046 --> 30:41.508
Jealous boyfriend. Boss's husband.

30:42.050 --> 30:43.051
Hell of a motive.

30:43.886 --> 30:45.012
That's an angle.

30:45.637 --> 30:47.306
An investigation into Ramon.

30:47.389 --> 30:52.311
Overlooked assistant turned
jealous boyfriend turned tragic murderer.

30:53.312 --> 30:57.691
Motive, no evidence. We have to be smart.

31:01.612 --> 31:03.197
When we were in the military,

31:03.280 --> 31:04.907
me and Noble were in the same unit.

31:04.990 --> 31:08.243
Our superior officers would force
the Black enlisted men

31:08.327 --> 31:10.162
to fight each other
while they placed bets.

31:10.829 --> 31:15.167
There was this one officer.
Real junkyard dog redneck.

31:15.667 --> 31:20.756
And one day, this motherfucker tried
to get me and Noble

31:20.839 --> 31:22.799
to fight each other to the death.

31:23.926 --> 31:26.136
We took one look at each other,
and we just--

31:27.471 --> 31:30.599
We just whipped his ass.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.393
I mean, we whipped
this motherfucker's ass.

31:33.477 --> 31:38.023
I mean, we just-- We stomped him, just--
Stomping him in his face,

31:38.106 --> 31:41.818
and just stomping him in his head
and just stomping him.

31:44.404 --> 31:46.949
They threw us in the brig,
beat us both with clubs.

31:47.032 --> 31:49.576
Beat me until I didn't know
my fucking name.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.538
Dishonorable discharge for both of us.

31:54.873 --> 31:57.584
But when I got out,
I never took orders again.

32:00.212 --> 32:01.380
From anybody.

32:02.881 --> 32:05.050
Do you think those boxing matches

32:05.133 --> 32:09.304
and that beatdown led to your
current medical issues?

32:14.643 --> 32:17.771
Yes. I do.

32:23.735 --> 32:26.572
That old junkyard dog won in the end,
didn't he?

32:31.159 --> 32:33.370
He's gonna rob me of everything I love.

32:38.792 --> 32:39.960
Ain't that a bitch?

33:01.773 --> 33:05.611
Ramon Tomas. Inspector Aames.
You mind if we talk?

33:05.694 --> 33:07.571
I'm busy. Fuck off.

33:07.654 --> 33:12.701
Or we can do this down at the station,
of course, but, you know, coffee.

33:19.833 --> 33:20.834
Here you go.

33:24.087 --> 33:27.132
So, give me a reason to believe

33:27.216 --> 33:29.635
Ramon Tomas had nothing to do
with this murder.

33:30.302 --> 33:31.720
Right now, we got you on motive.

33:31.803 --> 33:36.517
You got no alibis,
and... you got a record.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.893
No, I don't.

33:38.810 --> 33:40.354
Yeah. You--

33:40.437 --> 33:42.898
You bashed that kid's head in
when you were 16.

33:43.649 --> 33:44.650
That was expunged.

33:44.733 --> 33:47.277
Yeah, he suffered
permanent brain damage, right?

33:49.655 --> 33:51.657
My juvenile records were sealed.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.659
I didn't dig up your record.

34:01.041 --> 34:02.876
What else did Micah say?

34:02.960 --> 34:04.545
Well, she--

34:05.754 --> 34:09.466
Man, she dimed you out
in the nicest way I have ever seen.

34:10.050 --> 34:12.886
Yeah, she kept telling me
how much she still loves you,

34:12.969 --> 34:15.764
but until you confess,
she wants to see you locked up.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.272
Are you arresting me?

34:26.358 --> 34:27.359
Not yet.

34:35.784 --> 34:36.869
Shit.

34:54.887 --> 34:56.096
Poppy.

34:56.763 --> 34:58.390
-Yeah.
-Poppy.

34:58.473 --> 34:59.892
What's wrong?

34:59.975 --> 35:02.686
Ramon is having a full-on breakdown. Live.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.897
But there is no reason
for us to take it anymore.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.066
Let's begin with our hypocrite-in-chief,
Micah Keith.

35:08.942 --> 35:12.446
The queen bitch herself doesn't
give a flying fuck about any of you.

35:12.529 --> 35:14.823
She laughs at you.
In fact, we all laugh at you.

35:14.907 --> 35:17.201
At your pain. Your grief.

35:17.284 --> 35:19.161
-Your life's manifestations.
-Does anyone know where he is?

35:19.244 --> 35:21.246
-All she cares about is money. Your money.
-Anyone?

35:21.330 --> 35:23.540
Selling you grade A organic bullshit.

35:23.624 --> 35:25.375
Micah feeds off of your insecurities.

35:25.459 --> 35:27.461
She takes advantage
of your vulnerabilities.

35:27.544 --> 35:29.379
Her methods are illegal, by the way.

35:29.463 --> 35:31.798
And guess what?
I have the evidence to prove it.

35:31.882 --> 35:33.592
-Come on.
-They laugh at your grief and your

35:33.675 --> 35:35.677
-pathetic stories are a means to an end.
-Answer, Ramon.

35:35.761 --> 35:37.471
-Profiting off of your loss.
-Shit.

35:37.554 --> 35:40.057
Blaine. He's on a company phone.

35:40.140 --> 35:42.309
You should be able to shut it down.
Shut it down now.

35:42.392 --> 35:45.229
Selling you grade A organic,
gluten-free bullshit.

35:45.312 --> 35:47.356
Stories are only a means to an end.
Profiting--

35:47.940 --> 35:48.899
Got it.

35:49.608 --> 35:50.609
Fuck!

35:52.736 --> 35:53.737
Fuck.

35:55.864 --> 35:56.865
Good job.

35:58.325 --> 35:59.326
Wow.

36:00.536 --> 36:01.703
Holy hell.

36:30.858 --> 36:32.359
You know, for the record,

36:33.819 --> 36:36.947
I would've tried to figure out
a way to reconcile things.

36:38.031 --> 36:40.284
But what you did today, man, I mean--

36:40.826 --> 36:41.994
Look, I'm sorry.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.337
-This everything?
-Yeah.

36:54.423 --> 36:56.300
They kicking me out?

36:59.136 --> 37:00.721
What you expect to happen, man?

37:03.098 --> 37:05.601
-She said she'll give you a week.
-Where am I gonna go?

37:06.268 --> 37:10.063
Without a salary, I'm fucked.
I'm so fucked.

37:10.147 --> 37:13.483
-Listen to me. It's gonna be okay.
-No, it won't.

37:15.194 --> 37:18.405
One mistake. Eight years of my life.

37:21.909 --> 37:23.535
I'm sorry this happened to you.

37:28.207 --> 37:31.168
For the record,
Micah didn't tell you the whole story.

37:33.337 --> 37:35.964
Yeah, I hit that kid,
but he wasn't just some kid.

37:36.048 --> 37:37.799
He was my bully.

37:37.883 --> 37:40.469
He had at least two years
and 50 pounds on me.

37:40.552 --> 37:41.762
Terrorized me for years.

37:43.055 --> 37:45.140
So one day, I snapped.

37:47.184 --> 37:48.352
I felt terrible.

37:49.895 --> 37:53.357
But when people are trapped,
what else do you expect them to do?

37:58.320 --> 37:59.655
If you need me, you call me.

38:01.573 --> 38:02.699
I mean it.

38:25.514 --> 38:26.682
Micah.

38:26.765 --> 38:29.476
Given your close relationship to Ramon,

38:29.560 --> 38:34.189
and following his recent
and very public allegations,

38:34.273 --> 38:37.359
you feel obligated
to set the record straight.

38:38.026 --> 38:42.406
So, Micah, is there any truth
to the things he said?

38:42.489 --> 38:46.869
Is there theater performance
to my presentations and speeches?

38:46.952 --> 38:48.579
Yes, of course. You know that.

38:49.663 --> 38:53.584
It's the age we live in.
But the message is real.

38:53.667 --> 38:59.631
Are you worried that Ramon might reveal
or peddle your secrets?

38:59.715 --> 39:02.342
No, I can't be hampered by that.

39:02.426 --> 39:07.097
My goal is to live out my journey
and to help others do the same.

39:07.181 --> 39:10.893
What is your journey? Your purpose?

39:10.976 --> 39:13.020
Because according to Ramon,

39:13.103 --> 39:15.397
it's to line your pockets
with other people's gold.

39:17.357 --> 39:20.694
Don't... play me.

39:21.486 --> 39:26.241
We go way too far back
for you to sink this low.

39:26.325 --> 39:27.534
What are you talking about?

39:27.618 --> 39:31.997
I asked you to help me
find my husband's killer.

39:32.706 --> 39:35.417
But if you're going to
sensationalize everything,

39:35.501 --> 39:36.502
then let's forget it.

39:36.585 --> 39:39.087
You asked me to find out
why he lied to you.

39:42.549 --> 39:44.426
I don't wanna do this anymore.

39:46.803 --> 39:48.263
This is my job, Micah.

39:49.139 --> 39:51.725
I was clear about that. Very.

39:52.226 --> 39:54.061
And you agreed.

39:57.564 --> 40:01.527
I just feel like everybody
in my life is exploiting me.

40:03.820 --> 40:04.821
Micah.

40:16.250 --> 40:19.461
Doctor Maya Angelou once wrote,

40:20.504 --> 40:25.717
"The thorn from the bush
one has planted, nourished, and pruned

40:25.801 --> 40:29.805
pricks more deeply and draws more blood."

40:29.888 --> 40:33.559
For Micah Keith, Ramon Tomas is that bush.

40:34.309 --> 40:37.938
And today's betrayal has sent
shock waves to her core.

40:38.814 --> 40:43.735
Micah saw the goodness in Ramon
when no one else did.

40:45.112 --> 40:48.448
But Ramon was keeping secrets from her.

40:50.075 --> 40:56.707
And now those buried secrets are starting
to come back with teeth.

40:57.499 --> 41:03.088
As they bring Ramon to his breaking point,
one question remains:

41:04.423 --> 41:06.842
Who will bleed deeper?

41:08.969 --> 41:14.850
My name is Poppy Parnell,
and I'd like you to reconsider.
