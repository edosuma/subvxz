(water rushing)

00:09.202 --> 00:10.730
(leaves rustling)

00:10.730 --> 00:13.730
(suspenseful music)

00:46.403 --> 00:49.070
(bird chirping)

00:54.394 --> 00:57.727
(paperclips clattering)

00:59.146 --> 01:02.146
(suspenseful music)

01:42.315 --> 01:46.301
(leaves rustling)
(wind howling)

01:46.301 --> 01:49.051
(birds chirping)

01:52.153 --> 01:55.153

02:30.476 --> 02:35.476
(wind howling)

03:46.631 --> 03:48.798
(sighing)

03:49.789 --> 03:50.880
(phone ringing)

03:50.880 --> 03:52.752
(knocking)

03:52.752 --> 03:54.166
- Come in.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.833
(door creaking)

03:58.308 --> 03:59.446
- [Derek] Detective Walters?

03:59.446 --> 04:01.029
- Yes, Mr. Stevens?

04:01.947 --> 04:03.781
Please, have a seat.

04:03.781 --> 04:08.531
Sorry about the mess, we're
in the middle of renovations.

04:10.267 --> 04:11.434
How's the leg?

04:12.381 --> 04:15.241
- No disrespect, Detective,
but why am I here?

04:15.241 --> 04:17.332
I gave my statement in
the hospital already.

04:17.332 --> 04:18.165
- Yeah, you did.

04:18.165 --> 04:19.797
And I apologize about not being there

04:19.797 --> 04:22.623
to take it personally, but
there's still a few holes

04:22.623 --> 04:25.118
that we need help filling
in, and you're the only one

04:25.118 --> 04:26.785
who has any answers.

04:29.171 --> 04:30.819
- Like what?

04:30.819 --> 04:33.236
- Like what did he look like?

04:35.704 --> 04:36.537
- Who?

04:37.566 --> 04:38.816
- The murderer.

04:40.103 --> 04:40.936
(whooshing)

04:40.936 --> 04:45.349
- [Derek] He was covered
in furs and bones.

04:45.349 --> 04:48.685
He had a knife and wooden spears.

04:48.685 --> 04:49.518
(whooshing)

04:49.518 --> 04:50.998
- Wooden spears?

04:50.998 --> 04:54.831
- Yeah, the kind you
carve, survivalist stuff.

04:56.778 --> 04:58.537
You know what, do I need my lawyer?

04:58.537 --> 05:00.273
- Only if you want one.

05:00.273 --> 05:03.339
We can wait if you like but

05:03.339 --> 05:04.769
I have to be honest with you, Mr. Stevens,

05:04.769 --> 05:08.302
we haven't found him yet so
there is some urgency here.

05:08.302 --> 05:11.200
- You're gonna just use
whatever I say against me.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.468
- You're right, Mr. Stevens.

05:12.468 --> 05:15.091
If you lie to me, I
will use it against you.

05:15.091 --> 05:17.964
I'm a detective, it's my job.

05:17.964 --> 05:19.250
But if what you say is true.

05:19.250 --> 05:22.417
- It is.
- Then we're on the same side.

05:23.663 --> 05:24.663
- I don't...

05:26.492 --> 05:29.325
Look, I already told you everything, okay?

05:29.325 --> 05:33.007
- I need details, as
much as you can remember.

05:33.007 --> 05:36.909
You said he killed your
wife, your brother,

05:36.909 --> 05:38.626
and there's no trace of him.

05:38.626 --> 05:40.486
We need your help.

05:40.486 --> 05:41.670
- I'm sorry, I can't do this.

05:41.670 --> 05:45.471
- Mr. Stevens, he killed your child.

05:45.471 --> 05:47.717
Annie was pregnant, did you know that?

05:47.717 --> 05:50.300
(solemn music)

05:51.410 --> 05:54.291
Derek, please, I'm trying
to help find the man

05:54.291 --> 05:56.383
that destroyed your family.

05:56.383 --> 05:58.210
(sighs)

05:58.210 --> 06:00.869
(solemn music)

06:00.869 --> 06:02.952
How did your brother die?

06:04.534 --> 06:06.617
(groans)

06:09.821 --> 06:11.726
- (sighs) In my arms.

06:11.726 --> 06:13.116
- [Walters] Excuse me?

06:13.116 --> 06:13.949
- Kevin.

06:14.923 --> 06:19.257
He died in my arms, he
didn't see it coming.

06:19.257 --> 06:21.784
- [Walters] What happened?

06:21.784 --> 06:26.784
- He took one of those spears
to the back. (clears throat)

06:27.230 --> 06:30.461
- [Walters] Did you ever
go back to his body?

06:30.461 --> 06:31.294
- No.

06:32.438 --> 06:34.683
- Okay, if you don't mind I'd like

06:34.683 --> 06:37.531
to go back to the beginning.

06:37.531 --> 06:41.429
- (sighs) All right.

06:41.429 --> 06:43.688
- [Walters] After the Coast
Guard called off the search

06:43.688 --> 06:45.714
you went looking for Amy yourself?

06:45.714 --> 06:47.700
- [Derek] I wasn't ready to give up.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.123
- [Walters] So you brought Scott?

06:49.123 --> 06:50.514
- [Derek] He was like a brother to me,

06:50.514 --> 06:52.847
and he was willing to do
anything to help me find Amy.

06:52.847 --> 06:53.680
- Oh god.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.984
- [Walters] And Kevin?

07:01.655 --> 07:02.921
- [Derek] We needed his help.

07:02.921 --> 07:03.897
- Oh!

07:03.897 --> 07:06.171
Oh, you beautiful son of a bitch.

07:06.171 --> 07:07.146
- [Derek] It was Scott that looked him up

07:07.146 --> 07:09.563
and convinced me to call him.

07:12.838 --> 07:14.028
I guess it was a good enough reason

07:14.028 --> 07:16.111
to end a 15-year silence.

07:18.106 --> 07:20.689
(somber music)

07:23.356 --> 07:25.606
(groaning)

07:35.857 --> 07:37.024
You all right?

07:39.338 --> 07:41.755
- This land thing, I like it.

07:45.384 --> 07:47.967
(somber music)

08:00.338 --> 08:03.505
- [Kevin] Welcome to Bute Island boys.

08:04.861 --> 08:08.837
- [Derek] Well, Scott, I hope
you're not afraid of heights.

08:08.837 --> 08:10.156
- [Scott] This island is a little bigger

08:10.156 --> 08:12.908
than I thought it would be.

08:12.908 --> 08:15.575
(water rushing)

08:30.176 --> 08:32.759
(somber music)

08:40.267 --> 08:42.433
(panting)

08:58.530 --> 09:02.045
- I don't know why you
brought that freak with us.

09:02.045 --> 09:03.388
- Look, Kevin, he's been my best friend

09:03.388 --> 09:04.994
since we were like 12.

09:04.994 --> 09:05.827
- All right.

09:05.827 --> 09:07.258
- And you wouldn't be
here if it wasn't for him

09:07.258 --> 09:10.244
forcing me to call you in the first place.

09:10.244 --> 09:14.483
Look, he came all this way to
help me find Amy, all right?

09:14.483 --> 09:17.905
He's a good guy, just leave him alone.

09:17.905 --> 09:21.659
- Fine, just keep that fag away from me.

09:21.659 --> 09:22.633
- What is wrong with you, man?

09:22.633 --> 09:24.139
Where is this coming from?

09:24.139 --> 09:25.945
- From the first time I met him,

09:25.945 --> 09:28.189
when he came to Alaska from the city,

09:28.189 --> 09:31.532
the idiot shoots me in
the ass, what you mean?

09:31.532 --> 09:33.745
- [Derek] That was my BB
gun, and he was just a kid.

09:33.745 --> 09:35.524
- Okay, okay, okay, so what?

09:35.524 --> 09:37.285
What you think he gonna
shoot me with in the ass now?

09:37.285 --> 09:39.667
- Hey, guys. (panting)

09:39.667 --> 09:43.251
I'm sorry, I'm. (panting)

09:43.251 --> 09:44.084
Hey, hey.

09:45.576 --> 09:46.632
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:46.632 --> 09:50.573
I'm not used to climbing
to the top of things.

09:50.573 --> 09:53.802
- Yeah, well, maybe you
shoulda stayed on the bottom.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.885
Might like it down there.

10:01.481 --> 10:06.210
- It's all right, I'll stay
back with you, all right?

10:06.210 --> 10:08.793
- You're gonna have to tell me.

10:11.101 --> 10:15.079
I just wanna know why your
brother hates me so much.

10:15.079 --> 10:18.746
- He doesn't hate you,
he's just an asshole.

10:19.913 --> 10:23.051
That's just the way it is, bro.

10:23.051 --> 10:24.051
- I just don't want to step on his toes

10:24.051 --> 10:26.396
while we're here, all right, that's all.

10:26.396 --> 10:29.634
- I don't give a shit what Kevin thinks.

10:29.634 --> 10:31.301
You ready, city boy?

10:32.899 --> 10:33.899
- Douchebag.

10:34.932 --> 10:37.353
- Shit stain, come on, let's go.

10:37.353 --> 10:38.686
- Woo, go ahead.

10:39.718 --> 10:40.807
- [Kevin] Pick it up, you two.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.807
We got a long way to go.

10:44.591 --> 10:45.599
- [Scott] How far we goin'?

10:45.599 --> 10:47.274
- [Derek] I don't know, at least a mile.

10:47.274 --> 10:48.481
(Scott groans)

10:48.481 --> 10:53.481
We'll pick up where the Coast
Guard stopped searching.

10:53.564 --> 10:56.443
- [Scott] The longer I walk,
the heavier my backpack gets.

10:56.443 --> 10:57.966
- [Derek] That's 'cause your
pampered ass wanted to sleep

10:57.966 --> 10:59.633
in a eight-man tent.

11:01.208 --> 11:04.679
- [Scott] We may need the
extra space when you find Amy.

11:04.679 --> 11:06.714
- How did you pick Waite Island?

11:06.714 --> 11:08.578
There were no emergency beacons.

11:08.578 --> 11:09.745
- Lucky guess.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.158
It was in the right area.

11:12.158 --> 11:13.147
Kevin and I had been hunting up there

11:13.147 --> 11:15.715
when he was a teenager.

11:15.715 --> 11:17.153
I figured, the island we know was

11:17.153 --> 11:19.810
better than the island we didn't.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.685
- Derek, we found the wreck.

11:21.685 --> 11:23.520
Can you explain to me
why your fingerprints

11:23.520 --> 11:25.846
were on the engine?

11:25.846 --> 11:28.866
- Look, Amy and I, we did our
own maintenance on the plane.

11:28.866 --> 11:30.687
All right, the weekend
before she disappeared

11:30.687 --> 11:34.709
we stripped everything,
we cleaned everything.

11:34.709 --> 11:38.017
That's how I forgot the EPIRB.

11:38.017 --> 11:39.314
I had 100 things to pay attention to,

11:39.314 --> 11:44.314
and I forgot the fucking
emergency beacon. (sighs)

11:44.920 --> 11:46.716
We took the batteries out to replace 'em,

11:46.716 --> 11:49.383
and I forgot to put 'em back in.

11:50.254 --> 11:53.087
- [Walters] So what happened next?

11:58.258 --> 12:01.914
- [Scott] Dude, does
your cellphone work here?

12:01.914 --> 12:02.747
- Amy!

12:03.834 --> 12:05.119
- [Scott] Oh my god, this sucks.

12:05.119 --> 12:07.202
I don't have any service.

12:08.563 --> 12:09.396
- Amy!

12:11.159 --> 12:14.104
- [Scott] Like the freakin' moon out here.

12:14.104 --> 12:14.937
- Amy!

12:17.043 --> 12:19.710
(toy squeaking)

12:29.750 --> 12:31.719
- [Scott] Oh, Derek, I gotta
stop real quick, hold up.

12:31.719 --> 12:34.512
- [Derek] You look like a
damn fool with all that on.

12:34.512 --> 12:37.072
- [Scott] I didn't know what to buy.

12:37.072 --> 12:38.664
I bought everything I could find.

12:38.664 --> 12:40.914
- [Derek] Yeah, apparently.

12:44.660 --> 12:45.493
Scott, are you pissing?

12:45.493 --> 12:47.253
- Yo, I'm answering my emails over here.

12:47.253 --> 12:48.523
- Hurry up, man.

12:48.523 --> 12:50.636
- Woo, oh my god!

12:50.636 --> 12:54.053
Poor bastard almost got me on the pecker.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.193
Oh!

12:57.456 --> 12:58.775
Damn.

12:58.775 --> 13:00.541
What is that?

13:00.541 --> 13:01.996
- Devil's bug, man.

13:01.996 --> 13:03.169
- That shit has teeth.

13:03.169 --> 13:04.953
- [Kevin] Amy!

13:04.953 --> 13:05.786
Amy!

13:06.703 --> 13:08.707
- [Scott] Dude, he's been
yelling for two hours.

13:08.707 --> 13:11.508
Just give it a rest, man.

13:11.508 --> 13:14.139
- [Derek] Kevin's gonna wonder
what's taking us so long.

13:14.139 --> 13:16.806
- [Scott] Kevin better be there.

13:18.432 --> 13:19.795
(rifle blasting)

13:19.795 --> 13:22.795
(suspenseful music)

13:32.888 --> 13:34.882
- Yo, what the hell
happened, you all right?

13:34.882 --> 13:35.715
- Nothing.

13:37.044 --> 13:38.107
- Nothing?

13:38.107 --> 13:39.175
What do you mean nothing?

13:39.175 --> 13:40.768
- [Kevin] You two was dickin' around.

13:40.768 --> 13:43.703
I coulda been hurt, lost, something.

13:43.703 --> 13:44.900
- Wait, so you just shot the gun

13:44.900 --> 13:46.912
to scare us to walking faster?

13:46.912 --> 13:48.233
- It worked, didn't it?

13:48.233 --> 13:50.879
- [Derek] What the hell
is wrong with you, man?

13:50.879 --> 13:52.465
- No, you two listen good.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.877
We are stuck here in the
middle of nowhere Alaska

13:54.877 --> 13:58.642
looking for a plane wreck that
no one thinks is here but us.

13:58.642 --> 13:59.992
Look at this fog.

13:59.992 --> 14:03.127
This shit is rolling in
and out 24 hours a day.

14:03.127 --> 14:05.500
Now, if we get lost,

14:05.500 --> 14:07.741
We gon' be stuck here
for god knows how long.

14:07.741 --> 14:10.198
Now I want to find Amy and
get the hell outta here.

14:10.198 --> 14:11.209
The longer we screw around,

14:11.209 --> 14:15.126
the worse her chances of
being found alive get.

14:16.288 --> 14:19.419
Now I want you two to
start setting up camp here.

14:19.419 --> 14:23.502
Move that log, drag that
out, put the tent there.

14:24.434 --> 14:26.351
I'm going scouting.

14:26.351 --> 14:30.285
- You literally just
told us not to be alone.

14:30.285 --> 14:31.368
- Yup.

14:31.368 --> 14:33.768
- [Scott] Dude, I am so confused.

14:33.768 --> 14:36.958
- That's definitely an
onion you don't wanna peel.

14:36.958 --> 14:40.458
- Yeah, I thought my family was messed up.

14:47.323 --> 14:48.573
- What's wrong?

14:51.299 --> 14:55.049
- Don't you feel like
somebody's watching us?

14:57.627 --> 14:59.791
- I mean, it's the forest, dude.

14:59.791 --> 15:02.124
Something's always watching.

15:11.618 --> 15:14.742
(suspenseful music)

15:14.742 --> 15:17.492
(birds chirping)

15:23.730 --> 15:26.563
(thrilling music)

15:28.009 --> 15:30.509
(fly buzzing)

15:35.698 --> 15:38.198
(fly buzzing)

15:45.380 --> 15:47.713
- How the hell you get here?

15:53.073 --> 15:55.769
(suspenseful music)

15:55.769 --> 16:00.469
- You guys found a deer
head and a stuffed chicken?

16:00.469 --> 16:02.714
Kevin wasn't worried about it.

16:02.714 --> 16:04.133
- I mean, it should have been a red flag,

16:04.133 --> 16:08.436
but hunters go there
now and then, you know?

16:08.436 --> 16:10.380
It was weird, but it wasn't that weird.

16:10.380 --> 16:13.630
- [Walters] Hm, tell me about the guns?

16:14.729 --> 16:17.896
- I had my .45 and Kevin had his .338.

16:21.888 --> 16:24.884
And Scott. (chuckles)

16:24.884 --> 16:27.981
- Was Scott really that
useless in the wild?

16:27.981 --> 16:30.673
- His specialty was breaking the tension.

16:30.673 --> 16:33.506
That was about all he was good at.

16:35.401 --> 16:37.068
With Kevin around...

16:39.429 --> 16:42.334
There was nothing but tension.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.084
(birds chirping)

16:55.153 --> 16:57.066
- Place pretty wet?

16:57.066 --> 17:00.053
- What, we can't make a fire?

17:00.053 --> 17:02.970
- I didn't say that, but we're not.

17:05.689 --> 17:06.521
- Nice.

17:09.038 --> 17:13.154
Well, the camp's all set up, what's next?

17:13.154 --> 17:14.987
- Well, eat some food.

17:16.315 --> 17:19.647
And I want you two to go get some water.

17:23.428 --> 17:26.095
- [Derek] We'll go after we eat.

17:27.878 --> 17:29.962
(groans)

17:32.202 --> 17:33.395
- This for me?

17:33.395 --> 17:35.228
- Yup, it's all yours.

17:36.548 --> 17:38.392
- Made sure you used enough arsenic?

17:38.392 --> 17:39.791
- Just enough to kill you.

17:39.791 --> 17:43.124
- Yeah, all right, we'll see about that.

17:46.819 --> 17:48.571
- Here you go, Derek, heads up.

17:48.571 --> 17:49.738
- Thanks, man.

17:53.622 --> 17:56.289
(water rushing)

17:57.877 --> 17:59.544
Just let it go, man.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.942
- First we climb a mountain,

18:03.942 --> 18:07.786
now His Majesty sends us to fetch water.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.400
You know, I've been here for three hours,

18:09.400 --> 18:11.199
and I'm already sick of this shit.

18:11.199 --> 18:12.938
- Now, if you didn't sit
and play video games all day

18:12.938 --> 18:14.520
this wouldn't be an issue, Scott.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.520
(suspenseful music)

18:27.718 --> 18:30.385
(water rushing)

18:31.544 --> 18:33.294
- Hey, you all right?

18:35.750 --> 18:37.077
- Yeah.

18:37.077 --> 18:40.077
(suspenseful music)

18:44.744 --> 18:46.994
(groaning)

18:49.318 --> 18:52.068
(pills rattling)

18:59.476 --> 19:01.726
(groaning)

19:03.142 --> 19:06.059
(lighter clicking)

19:10.591 --> 19:13.895
- Didn't you tell Amy you quit smoking?

19:13.895 --> 19:16.608
- Dude, don't start, all right?

19:16.608 --> 19:18.032
- Well, did you?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.449
- Yes, and I did.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.653
I just haven't told her I started again.

19:28.173 --> 19:30.311
- Two months into marriage, and
you're already lying to her?

19:30.311 --> 19:32.764
- Dude, enough man, damn.

19:32.764 --> 19:33.796
I get this shit from everyone at work.

19:33.796 --> 19:37.678
I don't need to hear it
from you too, all right?

19:37.678 --> 19:40.261
(suspenseful music)

19:40.261 --> 19:43.569
(breathing heavily)

19:43.569 --> 19:45.819
(groaning)

19:46.808 --> 19:49.808
(suspenseful music)

20:08.415 --> 20:09.883
- Can we go now please?

20:09.883 --> 20:11.749
It's almost midnight.

20:11.749 --> 20:13.427
There's bears.

20:13.427 --> 20:14.260
I'm tired.

20:14.260 --> 20:17.521
- Yeah, not the bears that you like.

20:17.521 --> 20:18.354
- Dick.

20:20.482 --> 20:23.149
(water rushing)

20:48.452 --> 20:50.702
(groaning)

21:03.601 --> 21:04.434
- Stop.

21:05.289 --> 21:06.372
What is that?

21:07.417 --> 21:08.917
- [Scott] Nothing.

21:11.294 --> 21:13.461
- Scott, man, what's that?

21:14.780 --> 21:17.447
Come on, let me see, let me see.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.619
(laughing)

21:22.619 --> 21:23.702
- Let me see.

21:25.854 --> 21:28.104
(laughing)

21:29.873 --> 21:30.706
Stupid.

21:31.593 --> 21:33.278
- What you plan on doing with it?

21:33.278 --> 21:35.785
You gonna scratch a fly's ass?

21:35.785 --> 21:38.660
- It's the only gun I own, okay.

21:38.660 --> 21:39.879
- [Derek] The only gun I own.

21:39.879 --> 21:42.416
- [Kevin] Scott, not only is
this thing so old and small,

21:42.416 --> 21:44.249
it's accuracy is shit.

21:47.725 --> 21:49.143
- Really?

21:49.143 --> 21:50.462
- [Kevin] Yup.

21:50.462 --> 21:51.972
- [Derek] He's right, man.

21:51.972 --> 21:53.163
- [Scott] Great.

21:53.163 --> 21:55.869
Now I feel even more pathetic.

21:55.869 --> 21:59.059
- [Kevin] Well, the gun had
nothin' to do with that.

21:59.059 --> 22:00.329
(suspenseful music)

22:00.329 --> 22:02.496
Look what I found earlier.

22:04.335 --> 22:06.374
- Where in the hell did
you find this ugly thing?

22:06.374 --> 22:11.041
- [Kevin] Under that log that
was falling on that trail.

22:13.350 --> 22:15.834
- Hey, let me see that.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.917
- Man, them logs is mine.

22:19.261 --> 22:21.927
- I just wanted to see it.

22:21.927 --> 22:23.782
- What's wrong with him?

22:23.782 --> 22:24.908
Hey, don't stay up to late.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.741
We gotta be up and moving at 0500.

22:29.458 --> 22:31.524
- [Derek] Scott.

22:31.524 --> 22:32.357
Scott!

22:33.533 --> 22:36.200
Dude, what the hell is goin' on?

22:37.407 --> 22:38.906
- Nothin', man.

22:38.906 --> 22:40.917
He just been pissing me off.

22:40.917 --> 22:42.584
I just wanna see it.

22:44.573 --> 22:45.573
- All right.

22:48.658 --> 22:51.658
(suspenseful music)

23:17.600 --> 23:18.517
- Dumb ass.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.873
What the hell is this?

23:37.167 --> 23:38.000
Huh?

23:40.992 --> 23:42.075
What is that?

23:45.735 --> 23:46.729
Yeah, you better look at Derek.

23:46.729 --> 23:47.784
What the hell goin' on?

23:47.784 --> 23:49.034
- Kevin, relax.

23:54.116 --> 23:55.783
Scott, what is that?

23:57.556 --> 23:59.139
- [Kevin] Tell him!

24:00.343 --> 24:02.414
- I was gonna tell you,
I just, I didn't know.

24:02.414 --> 24:04.128
I didn't know how.
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.

24:04.128 --> 24:06.378
What are you talking about?

24:10.214 --> 24:12.052
- [Kevin] She's pregnant, Derek.

24:12.052 --> 24:14.136
- Pregnant, who?

24:14.136 --> 24:15.636
- [Kevin] Ask him.

24:18.018 --> 24:18.851
- Amy.

24:26.291 --> 24:27.124
- Scott.

24:30.783 --> 24:33.116
Scott, why do you have this?

24:36.240 --> 24:38.240
- [Kevin] Say something!

24:40.441 --> 24:41.642
- I swear to you, Derek.

24:41.642 --> 24:44.142
I had nothing to do with this.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.294
She called me.
- That's bullshit.

24:46.294 --> 24:47.365
- She sent it to me, Derek.
- Bullshit.

24:47.365 --> 24:49.156
- [Scott] She sent it
to me because she didn't

24:49.156 --> 24:50.619
know how to tell you.

24:50.619 --> 24:51.869
I swear to god.

24:53.924 --> 24:56.091
(gagging)

24:59.642 --> 25:02.725
- If I'm not the father, then who is?

25:15.951 --> 25:18.951
(suspenseful music)

25:29.152 --> 25:29.985
- Derek!

25:32.619 --> 25:33.619
Derek, wait.

25:35.896 --> 25:36.729
Derek!

25:40.979 --> 25:43.646
(water rushing)

26:07.861 --> 26:09.028
You all right?

26:15.626 --> 26:20.126
You need to get some rest,
we got a long day tomorrow.

26:21.898 --> 26:22.731
- Why?

26:27.057 --> 26:27.890
Why Scott?

26:34.107 --> 26:38.690
- I know you're upset in a
way that I can't understand.

26:41.238 --> 26:44.147
But we still gotta go find her.

26:44.147 --> 26:46.232
No matter how much it hurts,

26:46.232 --> 26:49.065
we can't just leave her out there.

26:55.242 --> 26:58.659
Look, don't stay out here too long, okay?

27:02.584 --> 27:05.167
(somber music)

27:12.651 --> 27:14.456
(suspenseful music)

27:14.456 --> 27:16.099
- I know I'm gettin' off track here,

27:16.099 --> 27:19.257
but Scott was your best friend, correct?

27:19.257 --> 27:20.569
By all accounts, you guys have been

27:20.569 --> 27:22.806
inseparable since high school,

27:22.806 --> 27:24.571
but you're not acting like it.

27:24.571 --> 27:27.321
- Yeah, Scott was my best friend.

27:28.437 --> 27:31.700
- [Walters] Why would he
bring Amy's ultrasound?

27:31.700 --> 27:35.159
- He wasn't as good a friend
as I thought he was, okay?

27:35.159 --> 27:37.302
- Can you tell me what happened to him?

27:37.302 --> 27:39.028
- [Derek] Well, I don't know.

27:39.028 --> 27:42.039
You would know more than me.

27:42.039 --> 27:43.789
- We never found him.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.426
- Huh?

27:46.426 --> 27:49.545
What do you mean you never found him?

27:49.545 --> 27:54.545
(birds chirping)
(insects chirping)

28:03.259 --> 28:06.621
- I'm only gonna tell you this once.

28:06.621 --> 28:09.842
Regardless how we all feel
towards each other this morning

28:09.842 --> 28:11.342
it's not relevant.

28:12.248 --> 28:13.869
The only thing that matters is covering

28:13.869 --> 28:15.793
as much of this island as possible

28:15.793 --> 28:18.793
to find my sister-in-law, your wife,

28:20.532 --> 28:23.026
and your best friend's wife.

28:23.026 --> 28:24.531
You got that?

28:24.531 --> 28:25.448
- Yes, sir.

28:26.406 --> 28:27.406
- All right.

28:28.664 --> 28:29.497
Derek.

28:32.263 --> 28:33.513
All right then.

28:35.105 --> 28:36.718
Now I want to form a simple path

28:36.718 --> 28:38.747
along the north side of the island.

28:38.747 --> 28:41.511
Derek, I want you about
50 yards to my right,

28:41.511 --> 28:43.147
parallel to my path.

28:43.147 --> 28:46.484
Scott, I want you to do
the same but to my left.

28:46.484 --> 28:48.315
Now be very vigilant of any sounds

28:48.315 --> 28:50.356
that don't belong in the forest.

28:50.356 --> 28:52.360
And most of all, be on the lookout

28:52.360 --> 28:55.787
for anything orange or
broken trees in the distance.

28:55.787 --> 28:59.700
That plane may very well be
stuck in a tree above us.

28:59.700 --> 29:00.617
Let's move.

29:10.519 --> 29:11.352
Amy!

29:12.589 --> 29:13.756
- [Derek] Amy!

29:14.789 --> 29:16.044
Amy!

29:16.044 --> 29:18.670
(flies buzzing)

29:18.670 --> 29:19.503
- Shit!

29:20.401 --> 29:23.238
Freaking bastards, get outta here.

29:23.238 --> 29:25.821
- [Derek] Amy, can you hear me?

29:27.142 --> 29:29.809
(flies buzzing)

29:32.232 --> 29:33.149
- Ah, gosh.

29:35.286 --> 29:36.716
- [Derek] Amy!

29:36.716 --> 29:38.966
(groaning)

30:06.021 --> 30:08.771
(pills rattling)

30:12.423 --> 30:14.673
(groaning)

30:30.961 --> 30:33.211
(grunting)

30:37.843 --> 30:38.676
(flies buzzing)

30:38.676 --> 30:39.509
- Damn it!

30:40.528 --> 30:43.898
(flies buzzing)

30:43.898 --> 30:47.148
Oh my god, oh my gosh, I can't do this.

30:48.982 --> 30:50.339
Come on!

30:50.339 --> 30:53.922
Please don't tell me
I left it at the camp.

30:55.672 --> 30:56.759
(hand slapping)

30:56.759 --> 30:57.759
Shit, Kevin!

30:59.442 --> 31:01.359
- [Kevin] Did I get it?

31:03.079 --> 31:05.338
- You scared the crap outta me, man.

31:05.338 --> 31:07.050
- Need a change of panties?

31:07.050 --> 31:07.883
Here.

31:11.730 --> 31:13.980
(spraying)

31:15.358 --> 31:16.525
- [Derek] Amy!

31:24.898 --> 31:26.065
- Bring it in!

31:34.983 --> 31:36.066
Take a break.

31:37.461 --> 31:39.085
Break time.

31:39.085 --> 31:40.761
- [Scott] How far did we get?

31:40.761 --> 31:43.201
- We covered quite a
bit, but we could do it

31:43.201 --> 31:45.782
for weeks at this rate.

31:45.782 --> 31:47.372
(pills rattling)

31:47.372 --> 31:48.205
- Look.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.034
Coast Guard said they
surveyed this island,

31:52.034 --> 31:54.671
and they just couldn't
find anything, right?

31:54.671 --> 31:55.992
- Yeah, so what's your point?

31:55.992 --> 31:59.957
- Well, most of the island
isn't that heavily forested.

31:59.957 --> 32:02.867
If we're right here, let's
just head to the dense patch

32:02.867 --> 32:05.034
by the lake, search there.

32:06.403 --> 32:08.129
- All right.

32:08.129 --> 32:09.523
That sounds like a plan.

32:09.523 --> 32:11.134
- All right.

32:11.134 --> 32:15.578
- Look, I'm not that hungry
so you boys finish up.

32:15.578 --> 32:17.353
I want you to go that
way then circle around

32:17.353 --> 32:20.190
the backside of those patch of trees.

32:20.190 --> 32:24.857
I'm gonna hit it from this
side, but from the lower end.

32:35.539 --> 32:38.289
(birds chirping)

32:39.878 --> 32:42.878
(suspenseful music)

32:49.714 --> 32:50.881
- Look, Scott.

32:51.741 --> 32:52.574
I, uh.

32:56.086 --> 32:56.919
I...

33:00.610 --> 33:01.443
- Me too.

33:03.523 --> 33:07.008
She made me promise not to tell you, man.

33:07.008 --> 33:09.548
I shoulda told you, dog, I.

33:09.548 --> 33:10.419
I'm real sorry.

33:10.419 --> 33:14.087
- It's all right, man, forget about it.

33:14.087 --> 33:15.471
I mean, you can't expect much from a guy

33:15.471 --> 33:17.617
who avoids confrontation with every fiber

33:17.617 --> 33:19.609
in his being, right?

33:19.609 --> 33:21.063
- [Scott] Thanks, dickhead.

33:21.063 --> 33:22.646
- No prob, asshole.

33:24.029 --> 33:26.034
All right, come on.

33:26.034 --> 33:27.867
Let's go find my wife.

33:29.770 --> 33:30.603
Amy!

33:33.298 --> 33:34.131
Amy!

33:35.039 --> 33:35.872
- Amy!

33:38.372 --> 33:39.205
Amy!

33:42.660 --> 33:43.827
- [Derek] Amy!

33:48.161 --> 33:49.328
- [Scott] Amy!

33:57.046 --> 33:59.598
I just don't get why she
had to fly home so badly.

33:59.598 --> 34:01.203
You know, especially in that fog.

34:01.203 --> 34:03.464
She coulda just stayed in
Sitka as long as she needed.

34:03.464 --> 34:05.040
- I don't know, man, you tell me?

34:05.040 --> 34:05.873
- [Kevin] Amy!

34:05.873 --> 34:09.087
- I mean, I begged her to
stay put and just wait it out,

34:09.087 --> 34:10.723
but she had to just come home

34:10.723 --> 34:12.449
and tell me something face-to-face.

34:12.449 --> 34:13.949
She couldn't wait.

34:14.975 --> 34:18.168
I guess we both know what
she needed to tell me, huh?

34:18.168 --> 34:19.752
- Yeah, I guess so.

34:20.855 --> 34:22.012
- [Kevin] Amy!

34:22.012 --> 34:23.913
- I don't know, he
should be the last person

34:23.913 --> 34:27.554
I'm thinking about right now,
but I'm worried about Kevin.

34:27.554 --> 34:28.514
- Why?

34:28.514 --> 34:30.447
- I mean, you haven't seen him

34:30.447 --> 34:32.846
downing those pills like they were candy?

34:32.846 --> 34:34.958
- No, dude, what are you talking about?

34:34.958 --> 34:36.491
- I don't know, I have.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.578
I mean, I don't know,
just something about him

34:38.578 --> 34:39.911
that's just off.

34:41.748 --> 34:44.440
- Yeah, man, it's your
brother, he's Kevin.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.031
He's always been off.

34:46.031 --> 34:47.596
Ain't nothin' new there.

34:47.596 --> 34:50.578
- Yeah, it's funny, he says
the same thing about you.

34:50.578 --> 34:51.630
I guess you both are just--

34:51.630 --> 34:52.714
- Shh, shh, shh!

34:52.714 --> 34:53.880
You hear that?

34:55.708 --> 34:58.856
- Oh my god, yeah, I hear it.

34:58.856 --> 34:59.758
Let's go.

34:59.758 --> 35:01.851
Hey, Kevin, over here!

35:01.851 --> 35:02.745
- Amy!

35:02.745 --> 35:03.745
- Amy!
- Amy!

35:05.397 --> 35:07.776
(suspenseful music)

35:07.776 --> 35:08.609
Holy shit.

35:09.483 --> 35:12.150
(water rushing)

35:16.242 --> 35:19.075
(water splashing)

35:28.213 --> 35:30.706
- [Kevin] Is that her plane?

35:30.706 --> 35:33.289
- [Derek] It's her tail number.

35:47.469 --> 35:48.633
- Derek.

35:48.633 --> 35:49.800
- [Derek] Amy!

35:53.057 --> 35:54.640
Where are you, Amy?

35:56.034 --> 35:57.367
- [Scott] Derek!

35:59.303 --> 36:01.303
- [Derek] Amy, I'm here!

36:06.045 --> 36:06.878
Amy!

36:10.029 --> 36:12.715
- [Kevin] Scott, give me the stat phone.

36:12.715 --> 36:17.382
- [Scott] (stammers) I didn't bring it.

36:18.687 --> 36:20.604
Derek, stop, come here.

36:26.346 --> 36:27.802
- Gotta head back to camp.

36:27.802 --> 36:29.408
- No.

36:29.408 --> 36:30.241
- What you mean no?

36:30.241 --> 36:31.571
I said we goin' back now!

36:31.571 --> 36:32.867
- Kevin, do you see this?

36:32.867 --> 36:33.903
- Okay, I do--
- Do you see this?

36:33.903 --> 36:35.621
She's nearby, she's close!

36:35.621 --> 36:37.493
- [Kevin] Listen to me.

36:37.493 --> 36:40.770
This moron let the stat phone at camp.

36:40.770 --> 36:42.198
We gotta go back now.

36:42.198 --> 36:43.858
- We just found a plane crash.

36:43.858 --> 36:46.289
- I know, Derek, I know.

36:46.289 --> 36:48.739
But we have to call
this in for Amy's sake.

36:48.739 --> 36:52.670
We can't waste anymore time
lookin' for her by ourselves.

36:52.670 --> 36:55.662
Talk some sense into him, Scott.

36:55.662 --> 36:58.995
- He's right, man, we gotta go back now.

37:00.235 --> 37:01.735
- That's bullshit.

37:05.130 --> 37:07.203
- Derek, come on.

37:07.203 --> 37:08.036
Hey.

37:12.619 --> 37:15.619
(suspenseful music)

37:18.212 --> 37:19.415
- Man, I'm starving.

37:19.415 --> 37:21.236
What you makin' for me?

37:21.236 --> 37:23.046
- The best of this situation.

37:23.046 --> 37:24.502
- [Kevin] Yeah, right.

37:24.502 --> 37:25.585
I'll do stew.

37:26.736 --> 37:27.986
- [Scott] Okay.

37:29.021 --> 37:30.091
Derek?

37:30.091 --> 37:32.163
- I'm not hungry.

37:32.163 --> 37:34.775
(suspenseful music)

37:34.775 --> 37:35.738
- You need to eat.

37:35.738 --> 37:38.655
- I said I'm not hungry, all right?

37:40.047 --> 37:40.880
- Okay.

37:41.724 --> 37:44.224
I'm gonna go check the fridge.

37:52.686 --> 37:55.436
(pills rattling)

38:00.084 --> 38:03.834
- You gonna tell me what
those are all about?

38:04.897 --> 38:07.308
- Tonight isn't the right time.

38:07.308 --> 38:11.808
- Isn't that exactly what
you said the night Mom died?

38:13.270 --> 38:16.437
- You had three months to say goodbye.

38:19.217 --> 38:22.462
- Three months to say goodbye.

38:22.462 --> 38:24.880
I told her I would be there for her.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.964
And you took that way from me.

38:27.964 --> 38:29.833
When you gonna learn to trust

38:29.833 --> 38:32.777
that I can protect myself?

38:32.777 --> 38:34.360
- [Scott] Uh, guys?

38:38.961 --> 38:40.294
- What happened?

38:41.261 --> 38:42.670
- Look.

38:42.670 --> 38:44.515
- Great, just great.

38:44.515 --> 38:46.406
You don't know how to tie knots?

38:46.406 --> 38:47.323
Stupid ass!

38:50.047 --> 38:52.297
- Hey, what you looking at?

38:55.004 --> 38:56.754
- That's interesting.

38:57.800 --> 38:58.633
No tracks.

38:59.524 --> 39:01.435
- What kinda bear doesn't leave tracks?

39:01.435 --> 39:03.912
- The kind I don't wanna run into.

39:03.912 --> 39:06.067
- Oh, wonderful.

39:06.067 --> 39:08.712
We're dealing with bears
that don't leave tracks.

39:08.712 --> 39:10.956
What are these, a bunch of fairy bears

39:10.956 --> 39:14.231
that can levitate through the forest?

39:14.231 --> 39:16.523
What are they, trained
in the arts of flying?

39:16.523 --> 39:17.756
- Shut up.
- Okay, this is bullshit.

39:17.756 --> 39:18.690
No, you shut up, Kevin.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.539
What are you gonna do when one

39:20.539 --> 39:22.536
of these levitating bears--
- What did you say to me?

39:22.536 --> 39:23.403
- What are you gonna do, man?

39:23.403 --> 39:24.908
What are you gonna do?
- You actin' a fool right now.

39:24.908 --> 39:26.445
- Okay, back up, Kevin.

39:26.445 --> 39:27.359
- Are you scared of the fairy bears, man?

39:27.359 --> 39:28.273
- Scott, shut up.

39:28.273 --> 39:30.044
- Better get your boy, I swear
to god, you better get him.

39:30.044 --> 39:32.266
- Hunter gatherer, big deal.
- Scott, shut up.

39:32.266 --> 39:33.811
- No, you shut him up.
- Let's go, we got bigger

39:33.811 --> 39:35.619
problems, let's go!

39:35.619 --> 39:36.494
- What an asshole?

39:36.494 --> 39:38.212
I hope one of these levitating
bears come down and--

39:38.212 --> 39:39.738
- [Kevin] Shut your faggot ass up!

39:39.738 --> 39:41.475
- How you gonna track a levitating bear?

39:41.475 --> 39:43.435
- Shut up!
- Mr. Master Tracker?

39:43.435 --> 39:47.283
I'm from Alaska and I'm real
tough and shit. (laughs)

39:47.283 --> 39:48.893
- [Walters] Why did you leave?

39:48.893 --> 39:50.799
- What?
- The wreck.

39:50.799 --> 39:53.967
You said Kevin made you leave the wreck,

39:53.967 --> 39:56.112
but you found the plane,

39:56.112 --> 39:59.275
and you left without looking for Amy?

39:59.275 --> 40:02.064
- (sighs) The wreck was
strewn all over the island.

40:02.064 --> 40:04.693
Half of it was at the bottom of the lake.

40:04.693 --> 40:09.526
- Wait, you found her wreck,
and you left without looking?

40:11.373 --> 40:14.854
- Okay, I know that Kevin
wanted us to leave, okay?

40:14.854 --> 40:17.233
Amy meant everything to me.

40:17.233 --> 40:19.373
And Scott wanted to leave too.

40:19.373 --> 40:21.286
- So your brother made you walk away

40:21.286 --> 40:24.602
from your pregnant wife
in bear country alone

40:24.602 --> 40:28.194
after she walked away from a plane wreck?

40:28.194 --> 40:30.901
- Yeah, he was a prick.

40:30.901 --> 40:34.318
He was an asshole, but he was my brother.

40:37.914 --> 40:40.476
- Did you ever find the food?

40:40.476 --> 40:43.265
- No.
- Then what did you eat?

40:43.265 --> 40:45.098
- We didn't, we drank.

40:46.943 --> 40:48.556
(birds chirping)

40:48.556 --> 40:49.771
- All right, all right.

40:49.771 --> 40:52.772
Take it while it's hot,
boys, take it while it's hot.

40:52.772 --> 40:55.254
Got the good stuff right here.
- Thanks, man.

40:55.254 --> 40:56.661
- [Scott] That's what I'm talking about.

40:56.661 --> 40:58.328
- Thanks, man.
- Yup.

40:59.552 --> 41:02.719
(Scott clears throat)

41:05.084 --> 41:06.167
- Hey, Derek.

41:07.841 --> 41:09.137
Look, I know you're mad at me

41:09.137 --> 41:13.127
for pushing return
early back to base camp,

41:13.127 --> 41:16.794
but I want you to know
today was a good day.

41:17.886 --> 41:21.136
We know she's here, saw her footprints.

41:22.399 --> 41:24.210
I just talked to the troopers,

41:24.210 --> 41:25.819
and if they don't get fogged in,

41:25.819 --> 41:29.195
they should be here first
thing in the morning.

41:29.195 --> 41:33.420
And I promise you we'll find her tomorrow.

41:33.420 --> 41:34.253
Cheer up.

41:37.176 --> 41:39.759
To you, you little bitch Scott!

41:43.751 --> 41:45.161
Hey, hey!

41:45.161 --> 41:48.213
Don't break eye contact when toasting.

41:48.213 --> 41:49.082
- What?

41:49.082 --> 41:50.185
- Yeah, man.

41:50.185 --> 41:52.024
Seven years bad sex when
you break eye contact

41:52.024 --> 41:53.323
when you toast.

41:53.323 --> 41:56.406
- I couldn't have bad sex if I tried.

42:00.216 --> 42:01.697
- All right. (clears throat)

42:01.697 --> 42:04.114
Here's a toast to Scotty boy.

42:05.745 --> 42:08.368
Scott, you didn't have to
come all the way down here,

42:08.368 --> 42:11.285
but you did, and I appreciate that.

42:12.505 --> 42:15.096
I don't appreciate you
hiding shit behind my back,

42:15.096 --> 42:18.929
but, you know, you didn't
bitch today, at all.

42:21.017 --> 42:24.322
And you handled my attitude very well.

42:24.322 --> 42:26.269
I wanna say thank you.

42:26.269 --> 42:28.323
Cheers, here's to you, buddy.

42:28.323 --> 42:29.323
There it is.

42:31.179 --> 42:32.117
- (chuckles) That's right.

42:32.117 --> 42:34.117
- One finger?
- Yup, yup.

42:35.218 --> 42:37.333
(groaning)

42:37.333 --> 42:39.256
- All right, my turn.

42:39.256 --> 42:40.089
- Oh god.

42:41.594 --> 42:43.633
- Here's to both of you.

42:43.633 --> 42:45.111
And thanks for bringing me out here

42:45.111 --> 42:47.472
when I know you would have much rather

42:47.472 --> 42:50.461
brought someone a little more useful.

42:50.461 --> 42:53.639
- Hear, hear!
(cups clanging)

42:53.639 --> 42:55.806
- [Scott] Thanks, brother.

42:59.482 --> 43:00.315
Oh, man.

43:01.878 --> 43:05.914
All right, well, I am off
to the little boys' room.

43:05.914 --> 43:06.937
- I'm glad you finally came to terms

43:06.937 --> 43:08.613
with your size problem, buddy.

43:08.613 --> 43:11.006
- [Scott] Of course I
have, I learned from you.

43:11.006 --> 43:12.931
- It's amazing how
funny you think you are.

43:12.931 --> 43:14.390
- [Scott] Yeah, I learned
that from you too!

43:14.390 --> 43:15.429
- Asshole.

43:15.429 --> 43:16.679
- [Scott] Okay!

43:21.140 --> 43:24.057
(lighter clicking)

43:55.102 --> 43:57.769
- [Kevin] I'm goin' to bed, man.

43:59.521 --> 44:01.604
(groans)

44:05.799 --> 44:06.632
- Woo!

44:08.714 --> 44:10.790
- [Derek] Damn, that was quick.

44:10.790 --> 44:11.819
Everything work out?

44:11.819 --> 44:13.779
- Oh yeah, good as new.

44:13.779 --> 44:15.377
Just like soft serve.

44:15.377 --> 44:16.317
- God, man.

44:16.317 --> 44:19.372
- [Scott] Hey, pass me that bottle.

44:19.372 --> 44:22.122
So you two have a heart to heart?

44:23.001 --> 44:25.479
(suspenseful music)

44:25.479 --> 44:29.527
- If only Mom could see how he ended up.

44:29.527 --> 44:32.393
Turning his back on his family.

44:32.393 --> 44:35.183
She'd be ashamed of him now.

44:35.183 --> 44:38.151
- Yeah, dude, he's a Army asshole.

44:38.151 --> 44:39.509
What'd you expect?

44:39.509 --> 44:42.993
- The Army had nothin'
to do with that, man.

44:42.993 --> 44:46.326
The second he took Mom off life support.

44:47.250 --> 44:49.083
He used to be my hero.

44:52.968 --> 44:56.009
- He can probably hear you.

44:56.009 --> 44:57.426
- Yeah, probably.

44:58.464 --> 45:02.714
I don't know why he just
can't be my brother again.

45:08.294 --> 45:11.286
- Me too, man, I wish that for you.

45:11.286 --> 45:14.036
- When he came back, he was just.

45:15.329 --> 45:17.162
He never even met Amy.

45:18.005 --> 45:21.265
(soft whimpering)

45:21.265 --> 45:22.515
- He is a dick.

45:24.007 --> 45:25.044
Like major dick.

45:25.044 --> 45:28.768
- (chuckles) Hand me the bottle, man.

45:28.768 --> 45:30.851
(crying)

45:32.021 --> 45:34.604
(wind howling)

45:36.766 --> 45:39.349
(somber music)

45:47.284 --> 45:49.951
(water rushing)

45:51.391 --> 45:53.974
(somber music)

45:58.620 --> 46:00.787
(panting)

46:04.582 --> 46:07.582
(zipper clattering)

46:08.564 --> 46:10.731
(panting)

46:21.292 --> 46:22.921
- Okay, okay, funny.
(hands clapping)

46:22.921 --> 46:24.732
Ha, ha, ha, ha, funny.

46:24.732 --> 46:26.982
Where'd you two put 'em at?

46:27.854 --> 46:29.198
Derek?

46:29.198 --> 46:31.765
Hey, hey, hey, up, up, up, up, up, up!

46:31.765 --> 46:33.749
Where the guns at?

46:33.749 --> 46:36.054
- I don't know, I didn't touch 'em.

46:36.054 --> 46:38.387
- Derek, where are the guns?

46:42.420 --> 46:43.253
Scott?

46:46.233 --> 46:47.890
Where'd you put 'em at, Scott?

46:47.890 --> 46:48.723
- [Scott] What?

46:48.723 --> 46:50.518
- Simple question, the
pistol and the rifle?

46:50.518 --> 46:51.401
Where is it?

46:51.401 --> 46:53.097
- [Scott] I haven't even touched a gun

46:53.097 --> 46:54.930
since we've been here.

46:59.488 --> 47:00.905
- You two get up.

47:03.259 --> 47:04.092
Now!

47:09.629 --> 47:11.844
- Did you move 'em?

47:11.844 --> 47:13.594
- No, I didn't move 'em.

47:13.594 --> 47:15.370
Hell no, did you?

47:15.370 --> 47:20.370
- [Scott] Derek, are you still
drunk enough to ask that?

47:20.517 --> 47:21.620
- [Kevin] Okay, this isn't funny.

47:21.620 --> 47:23.900
The guns is missing.

47:23.900 --> 47:25.037
- [Derek] I don't know, man.

47:25.037 --> 47:25.914
- What you mean, you don't know?

47:25.914 --> 47:28.199
If this is a joke, this isn't funny.

47:28.199 --> 47:30.158
Now where'd you two put the damn guns at?

47:30.158 --> 47:32.196
- [Derek] No one touched
yours, we know better.

47:32.196 --> 47:33.868
Mine was right next to it.

47:33.868 --> 47:37.198
- [Scott] I don't even know
what you're talkin' about, man.

47:37.198 --> 47:38.868
- All right, something's wrong.

47:38.868 --> 47:40.118
Outta bed, now.

47:46.979 --> 47:49.892
(groans)

47:49.892 --> 47:50.725
- Wait up.

47:56.396 --> 47:57.646
Kevin, wait up.

47:59.374 --> 48:01.374
- This is some bullshit!

48:06.714 --> 48:08.400
- Where'd you last leave 'em?
- Right where they should be.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.150
Leaning on the tree by
the front of the tent.

48:15.167 --> 48:16.139
- What are you looking at?

48:16.139 --> 48:18.389
- How the hell this happen?

48:22.850 --> 48:23.696
I swear.

48:23.696 --> 48:25.465
(groans) This is some bullshit!

48:25.465 --> 48:26.816
Head back to camp right now.

48:26.816 --> 48:29.445
Grab your packs, what ever
else you need for the day.

48:29.445 --> 48:33.278
I don't think Amy's been
alone on this island.

48:37.028 --> 48:38.644
- Dude, did you take the guns?

48:38.644 --> 48:40.025
- No, I didn't take the guns.

48:40.025 --> 48:41.357
- [Kevin] Okay, now I'm really pissed.

48:41.357 --> 48:42.512
- What happened?

48:42.512 --> 48:44.929
- The GPS stat phone is gone.

48:46.374 --> 48:47.662
- I don't understand.

48:47.662 --> 48:49.874
- What's not to understand, Scott?

48:49.874 --> 48:52.468
The food is stolen, the guns is missing,

48:52.468 --> 48:55.438
and our only communication
to the outside world is gone.

48:55.438 --> 48:56.669
How you not gettin' this?

48:56.669 --> 48:57.987
- Yelling at him or me is not gonna

48:57.987 --> 48:58.820
solve the situation.
- Whatever makes you

48:58.820 --> 49:00.376
feel better.
- Okay, all right, fine!

49:00.376 --> 49:03.132
Okay, so what are we gonna do now, huh?

49:03.132 --> 49:04.837
- We go and find our guns.

49:04.837 --> 49:07.087
We find those, we find Amy.

49:13.898 --> 49:17.170
- Why was Scott's gun left behind?

49:17.170 --> 49:20.701
- I don't know, maybe because
it was a piece of shit.

49:20.701 --> 49:23.080
I mean, Scott never carried it anyway.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.081
If it wasn't for that prick watching us

49:25.081 --> 49:26.257
while we were looking for Amy,

49:26.257 --> 49:29.571
he would have never known Scott
had it in the first place.

49:29.571 --> 49:33.653
- The man in the furs, when
was the next sight of him?

49:33.653 --> 49:35.543
(sighs)

49:35.543 --> 49:37.900
- We were headed back to
the beach looking for Amy,

49:37.900 --> 49:41.317
on a more direct route back to the wreck.

49:43.852 --> 49:44.685
Amy!

49:48.835 --> 49:50.002
- [Scott] Amy!

49:51.645 --> 49:52.812
- [Kevin] Amy!

49:53.761 --> 49:54.594
Amy!

49:59.041 --> 50:00.208
- [Scott] Amy!

50:04.030 --> 50:04.863
- Amy!

50:08.276 --> 50:09.109
- Amy!

50:10.855 --> 50:13.438
(somber music)

50:29.893 --> 50:32.226
(muttering)

50:39.743 --> 50:42.266
- [Kevin] Derek, don't look.

50:42.266 --> 50:44.933
(flies buzzing)

50:47.695 --> 50:50.528
(thrilling music)

51:33.131 --> 51:34.214
Is this hers?

51:39.122 --> 51:41.705
(somber music)

51:46.088 --> 51:48.671
(Derek crying)

51:55.416 --> 51:57.916
- What the hell is this place?

52:03.333 --> 52:05.739
Are all of those her bones?

52:05.739 --> 52:08.322
(Derek crying)

52:09.249 --> 52:12.416
- You gonna say that right now, Scott?

52:15.050 --> 52:17.633
(Derek crying)

52:20.043 --> 52:22.793
(dramatic music)

52:26.274 --> 52:27.107
- Guys.

52:28.377 --> 52:29.210
Guys.

52:31.373 --> 52:34.708
I think somebody's watching us.

52:34.708 --> 52:37.457
(crying)

52:37.457 --> 52:40.790
- Well, we 'bout to find out what it is.

52:51.256 --> 52:52.594
What'd you see, Scott?

52:52.594 --> 52:53.828
- I don't know, I saw something move--

52:53.828 --> 52:55.485
- [Kevin] Scott, did you see
something or you don't know?

52:55.485 --> 52:56.318
- I don't know!

52:56.318 --> 52:59.473
I heard a noise then I saw
something move right there, okay?

52:59.473 --> 53:00.306
- We done.

53:01.372 --> 53:02.539
We outta here.

53:08.750 --> 53:11.167
Derek, don't look, all right?

53:13.389 --> 53:15.972
(somber music)

53:31.490 --> 53:34.097
- We found what was left of the boneyard.

53:34.097 --> 53:34.930
- And Amy?

53:36.795 --> 53:41.545
- Bones don't last that long
in the woods, you know that.

53:44.117 --> 53:47.284
Are you sure I can't get you anything?

53:49.305 --> 53:50.638
- Coffee's fine.

53:51.805 --> 53:52.638
- Okay.

53:54.929 --> 53:57.183
(heels clacking)

53:57.183 --> 53:58.323
I'm still having a hard time

53:58.323 --> 54:01.041
with what happened to the baby.

54:01.041 --> 54:03.931
I really can't think of a worse thing.

54:03.931 --> 54:05.598
It's truly terrible.

54:07.361 --> 54:10.569
- Yeah, I didn't know about it.

54:10.569 --> 54:13.069
At least not until the island.

54:14.091 --> 54:17.341
- [Walters] Tell me what happened next?

54:18.667 --> 54:19.500
- Thanks.

54:26.224 --> 54:27.746
- Scott, give me your gun.

54:27.746 --> 54:29.261
- Why can't I have the gun?

54:29.261 --> 54:30.475
- Really?

54:30.475 --> 54:33.090
When the last time you used that?

54:33.090 --> 54:34.804
- Never.
- There you have it.

54:34.804 --> 54:36.221
Now give it here.

54:39.154 --> 54:41.987
(thrilling music)

54:52.581 --> 54:55.193
Scott, where's the rest of the ammo?

54:55.193 --> 54:56.859
- That's all there is.

54:56.859 --> 54:58.804
- You brought one live bullet?

54:58.804 --> 55:00.384
Were you punched as a baby?

55:00.384 --> 55:01.489
- [Derek] Kevin, chill out.

55:01.489 --> 55:04.580
- Hey, you know what,
Derek, it's cool, it's cool.

55:04.580 --> 55:05.413
I see what's goin' on.
- Oh, it's cool, mam?

55:05.413 --> 55:07.382
- Yeah, yeah, it is cool,
I see what's goin' on here.

55:07.382 --> 55:08.749
- What's that?
- Kevin's scared.

55:08.749 --> 55:09.791
- [Derek] Scott!

55:09.791 --> 55:11.051
- Oh okay, I am?

55:11.051 --> 55:12.248
Let me tell you a little something,

55:12.248 --> 55:14.572
I've seen more than you can
imagine, you little shit!

55:14.572 --> 55:16.928
Ain't nothin' on this
island I'm afraid of!

55:16.928 --> 55:20.106
Wolf, bear, man, or
whatever, you got that?

55:20.106 --> 55:21.659
- We need to go, all right?

55:21.659 --> 55:23.174
Kevin!

55:23.174 --> 55:24.743
- Yeah, I got that.
- Here we go.

55:24.743 --> 55:27.835
(thrilling music)

55:27.835 --> 55:30.585
(feet pattering)

55:37.507 --> 55:39.757
Come on, come on, let's go!

55:44.279 --> 55:45.529
In, in, in, in!

55:50.599 --> 55:51.799
Start it up, I'll push off.

55:51.799 --> 55:52.799
- All right.

56:00.595 --> 56:02.320
(engine sputtering)

56:02.320 --> 56:03.478
Shit.

56:03.478 --> 56:04.960
Shit, come on.

56:04.960 --> 56:05.956
Kevin.

56:05.956 --> 56:07.039
- Move, move!

56:08.988 --> 56:10.692
(engine sputtering)

56:10.692 --> 56:11.525
Damn!

56:14.384 --> 56:16.149
Son of a bitch!

56:16.149 --> 56:18.236
- [Scott] What happened?

56:18.236 --> 56:19.112
What's wrong?

56:19.112 --> 56:19.945
- Come on, man.

56:19.945 --> 56:22.178
Please tell me you have
a spare, come on, Kevin.

56:22.178 --> 56:24.261
- A spare what?
- Damn it!

56:28.246 --> 56:29.921
- Okay, okay, okay, wait.

56:29.921 --> 56:30.754
Okay.

56:32.054 --> 56:33.061
Why would he take the fuel filter

56:33.061 --> 56:34.379
and not cut the fuel line, huh?

56:34.379 --> 56:35.510
(hands clapping)

56:35.510 --> 56:38.181
- Come on!
- So we can't leave?

56:38.181 --> 56:39.431
- [Derek] Look.

56:43.458 --> 56:44.712
- I have these.

56:44.712 --> 56:46.651
- [Scott] What do the keys have
to do with the fuel filter?

56:46.651 --> 56:47.730
- Isn't it obvious, Scott?

56:47.730 --> 56:49.330
- [Scott] Well, obviously not, dude.

56:49.330 --> 56:51.243
- He can't leave without the keys.

56:51.243 --> 56:54.351
And he knows we can't leave
without the fuel filter.

56:54.351 --> 56:57.014
- Great, that is just freakin' great.

56:57.014 --> 56:58.454
What are we gonna do now, huh?

56:58.454 --> 57:01.104
Go hunt the psycho
cannibal killer that's--

57:01.104 --> 57:03.141
(hand slapping)
(Scott groaning)

57:03.141 --> 57:04.589
- Have some respect!

57:04.589 --> 57:08.589
- Jesus Christ, Kevin. (groans)

57:09.488 --> 57:12.988
Derek, Derek, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

57:15.585 --> 57:17.922
(dramatic music)

57:17.922 --> 57:19.339
He's right there.

57:22.491 --> 57:24.505
- Son of a bitch.

57:24.505 --> 57:25.754
- Imma kill him.

57:25.754 --> 57:27.332
- Bro, no you not.
- Move, man!

57:27.332 --> 57:28.431
- I'm not letting you do that!

57:28.431 --> 57:29.820
- You can't stop me.
- Like hell I can't!

57:29.820 --> 57:32.977
(fist smashing)

57:32.977 --> 57:36.560
If someone gotta be
killed, I'm gon' do it.

57:38.296 --> 57:39.129
Fuck, boy.

57:40.180 --> 57:42.659
Both of you stay here.

57:42.659 --> 57:43.984
- You all right?

57:43.984 --> 57:48.901
- [Derek] Just go after him,
bro, I'll be right behind you.

57:50.457 --> 57:53.457
(suspenseful music)

57:57.644 --> 57:58.791
- You went off on your own?

57:58.791 --> 57:59.624
- Yeah.

58:00.474 --> 58:01.963
- Why?

58:01.963 --> 58:03.376
- Because I wanted to
go after the bastard,

58:03.376 --> 58:05.376
and Kevin was in my way.

58:06.328 --> 58:09.827
- So you tried to take
matters into your own hands.

58:09.827 --> 58:13.008
- Yeah, he stole my wife from me.

58:13.008 --> 58:15.284
- [Walters] Scott saw the stalker?

58:15.284 --> 58:18.867
- Yeah, in the tree
line outside the beach.

58:20.398 --> 58:21.668
If it wasn't for him, we
wouldn't have split up

58:21.668 --> 58:23.668
in the boat like we did.

58:25.298 --> 58:28.069
- And after you split up,
that's when you hurt your leg?

58:28.069 --> 58:31.486
- Yes, that's when I hurt my leg, I fell.

58:33.198 --> 58:35.306
- Do you know what
happened to Kevin and Scott

58:35.306 --> 58:37.306
after you left the boat?

58:39.196 --> 58:41.628
- Scott caught up to Kevin and

58:41.628 --> 58:45.361
Kevin got on packing and
said go back to the boat.

58:45.361 --> 58:46.820
(leaves rustling)

58:46.820 --> 58:48.153
- [Scott] Kevin!

58:53.052 --> 58:53.885
Kevin!

58:58.261 --> 58:59.678
Kevin, slow down!

59:02.127 --> 59:02.960
Kevin.

59:03.871 --> 59:06.538
- You'll get me killed, shut up.

59:09.278 --> 59:10.445
Where's Derek?

59:11.479 --> 59:13.062
- He's right there.

59:14.221 --> 59:15.054
Derek!

59:15.933 --> 59:17.536
- That fool went off on his own.

59:17.536 --> 59:18.619
- Hey, Derek!

59:20.257 --> 59:22.221
- Fucking hear me.
- Look dude, dude, dude, dude.

59:22.221 --> 59:24.761
- Fucking hear me so I can have a break.

59:24.761 --> 59:26.928
Now, from now on, silence.

59:30.272 --> 59:32.824
If I hear you again, I will kill you.

59:32.824 --> 59:33.657
- Yeah.

59:36.539 --> 59:40.039
- Now get back to the boat and stay there.

59:42.647 --> 59:45.647
(suspenseful music)

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:44.555
(dramatic music)

01:00:50.629 --> 01:00:51.462
- You.

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:57.030
You killed my wife, didn't
you, you son of a bitch?

01:00:58.608 --> 01:01:00.858
You gonna kill me too, huh?

01:01:04.122 --> 01:01:06.759
Come on, come on, I'm not
afraid of you, come on!

01:01:06.759 --> 01:01:09.009
(groaning)

01:01:10.205 --> 01:01:12.872
(loud groaning)

01:01:17.754 --> 01:01:20.504
My leg! (groans)

01:01:27.442 --> 01:01:30.442
(suspenseful music)

01:01:34.329 --> 01:01:36.483
What the hell are you doing, man?

01:01:36.483 --> 01:01:37.661
(groaning)

01:01:37.661 --> 01:01:40.494
What the hell do you want from me?

01:01:41.561 --> 01:01:42.894
- [Kevin] Derek!

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.807
- [Derek] Down here!

01:01:58.044 --> 01:02:00.544
- You okay, you gonna be okay?

01:02:02.421 --> 01:02:03.891
Let's get outta here before he come back.

01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:04.781
I'm gonna get my gun, okay?

01:02:04.781 --> 01:02:05.948
Be right back.

01:02:07.279 --> 01:02:10.279
(suspenseful music)

01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:14.649
(groaning)

01:02:19.137 --> 01:02:21.804
(loud groaning)

01:02:31.093 --> 01:02:31.926
- Kevin.

01:02:32.986 --> 01:02:34.653
Relax, bro, come on.

01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:38.628
Kevin!

01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:41.268
Here, here.

01:02:42.874 --> 01:02:44.791
Swallow it, swallow it.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:52.188
Tell me the truth, man, what
the hell's wrong with you?

01:02:52.188 --> 01:02:53.438
- I don't know.

01:02:54.276 --> 01:02:55.859
I know it's cancer.

01:02:59.924 --> 01:03:02.007
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:03:04.544 --> 01:03:06.590
- Because I couldn't.

01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:08.673
It wasn't the right time.

01:03:09.972 --> 01:03:12.158
- I'll always protect you, man.

01:03:12.158 --> 01:03:13.158
You hear me?

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.937
- A little bit. (groans)

01:03:19.185 --> 01:03:22.430
(suspenseful music)

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:23.263
- Kevin.

01:03:27.118 --> 01:03:28.524
Kevin.

01:03:28.524 --> 01:03:29.357
Kevin.

01:03:34.512 --> 01:03:36.762
(groaning)

01:03:38.761 --> 01:03:40.178
Stop, don't move!

01:03:44.033 --> 01:03:46.616
(gun blasting)

01:03:53.187 --> 01:03:55.437
(groaning)

01:03:59.671 --> 01:04:01.921
(groaning)

01:04:04.571 --> 01:04:07.154
(somber music)

01:04:09.765 --> 01:04:12.432
(water rushing)

01:04:14.857 --> 01:04:19.857
(groaning)
(branch cracking)

01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:27.288
(water splashing)
(groaning)

01:04:27.288 --> 01:04:30.667
(suspenseful music)

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:32.917
(groaning)

01:04:38.494 --> 01:04:43.494
(water splashing)
(groaning)

01:04:47.591 --> 01:04:52.591
(groaning)
(water splashing)

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:08.330
(suspenseful music)

01:05:09.648 --> 01:05:11.898
(groaning)

01:05:40.225 --> 01:05:42.475
(groaning)

01:05:50.929 --> 01:05:53.596
(water rushing)

01:05:56.831 --> 01:05:59.831
(suspenseful music)

01:06:01.264 --> 01:06:04.573
(groans) Ah, let go of me!

01:06:04.573 --> 01:06:06.282
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

01:06:06.282 --> 01:06:08.532
(groaning)

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.470
Where's your brother?

01:06:21.538 --> 01:06:23.371
- He'd didn't make it.

01:06:26.331 --> 01:06:27.164
- Come on.

01:06:29.443 --> 01:06:31.693
(grunting)

01:06:34.942 --> 01:06:35.775
Don't worry, man.

01:06:35.775 --> 01:06:37.858
I got a safe place to go.

01:06:40.898 --> 01:06:43.233
Oh shit, did you see that?

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:44.483
Did you see it?

01:06:47.901 --> 01:06:50.151
(groaning)

01:06:51.552 --> 01:06:52.385
That.

01:06:54.395 --> 01:06:56.875
That's a big one, last one.

01:06:56.875 --> 01:06:57.708
(groans)

01:06:57.708 --> 01:06:59.125
Come on, come on.

01:07:00.859 --> 01:07:02.192
You good?
- Yeah.

01:07:03.083 --> 01:07:05.750
(bird warbling)

01:07:14.243 --> 01:07:15.826
- [Scott] You okay?

01:07:17.292 --> 01:07:18.549
- Yeah.

01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:19.549
Thanks, man.

01:07:26.128 --> 01:07:30.400
I really, really wish I had
a cigarette right now, man.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.400
- I don't even smoke and I want one.

01:07:34.442 --> 01:07:35.808
- Where'd you go by the way?

01:07:35.808 --> 01:07:37.663
- I have no damn clue.

01:07:37.663 --> 01:07:39.968
I was running around shittin'
my pants for three hours

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:43.385
trying to find you and trying to avoid it.

01:07:43.385 --> 01:07:44.468
- [Derek] It?

01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:46.182
No, he.

01:07:50.165 --> 01:07:52.945
- Kevin's pain attack slowed him down.

01:07:52.945 --> 01:07:55.752
That's when he was hit
in the back with a spear?

01:07:55.752 --> 01:07:56.944
- Yeah.

01:07:56.944 --> 01:07:59.777
I guess it made him a easy target.

01:08:01.647 --> 01:08:05.075
- Can you tell us what happened to Scott?

01:08:05.075 --> 01:08:06.393
- I...

01:08:06.393 --> 01:08:08.976
We separated, we got separated.

01:08:11.759 --> 01:08:14.888
And there was no way we could get

01:08:14.888 --> 01:08:17.863
off that island with the
boat disabled like that.

01:08:17.863 --> 01:08:20.363
I, with my leg, I was useless.

01:08:24.962 --> 01:08:25.854
(suspenseful music)

01:08:25.854 --> 01:08:28.087
Scott found this old
wreck the night before.

01:08:28.087 --> 01:08:30.787
And he saw the filter, but
he couldn't risk getting it.

01:08:30.787 --> 01:08:33.037
I was there to get it back.

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.151
- [Scott] Derek!

01:08:38.151 --> 01:08:40.651
- [Derek] Scott was the decoy.

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:44.033
- Derek, where you at?

01:08:45.048 --> 01:08:46.616
Derek?

01:08:46.616 --> 01:08:49.108
- [Walters] Why did you have a gas can?

01:08:49.108 --> 01:08:50.861
- [Derek] He took the filter.

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:52.242
We grabbed some gas to make sure

01:08:52.242 --> 01:08:54.242
he didn't take that too.

01:08:55.185 --> 01:08:56.511
- [Scott] Derek!

01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:57.805
- [Walters] So you were there hoping to

01:08:57.805 --> 01:09:00.706
find the keys and the filter
while your best friend

01:09:00.706 --> 01:09:02.622
bated a maniac?
- Derek!

01:09:03.488 --> 01:09:04.738
- [Derek] Yeah.

01:09:05.593 --> 01:09:06.926
- [Scott] Derek!

01:09:10.317 --> 01:09:11.149
Derek!

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.866
- [Walters] So what did you find?

01:09:16.866 --> 01:09:21.014
- [Derek Voiceover] Kevin's
backpack, Amy's clothes.

01:09:21.014 --> 01:09:24.264
I was just supposed to find the filter.

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:26.572
(somber music)

01:09:26.572 --> 01:09:27.738
But I snapped.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:33.361
He had taken everything from me.

01:09:33.361 --> 01:09:36.567
From there on, all I wanted to do was just

01:09:36.567 --> 01:09:40.149
burn his whole fuckin'
world to the ground.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:44.942
(somber music)

01:10:02.223 --> 01:10:07.223
(lighter clicking)
(flame crackling)

01:10:09.217 --> 01:10:10.800
This one's for Amy.

01:10:13.549 --> 01:10:16.254
- [Walters] And you never saw Scott again?

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:18.837
- After that, I just ran and...

01:10:21.624 --> 01:10:23.124
And I heard Scott.

01:10:24.867 --> 01:10:27.700
He had been calling my name and...

01:10:31.053 --> 01:10:32.386
- [Scott] Derek!

01:10:36.242 --> 01:10:37.909
Derek, where you at?

01:10:40.565 --> 01:10:45.565
(branch cracking)
(groaning)

01:10:47.628 --> 01:10:49.878
(groaning)

01:10:56.882 --> 01:10:59.815
(thrilling music)

01:10:59.815 --> 01:11:02.254
(bones cracking)

01:11:02.254 --> 01:11:04.139
(groaning)

01:11:04.139 --> 01:11:05.222
Oh, what the?

01:11:07.505 --> 01:11:09.128
Oh, it's fucking bones!

01:11:09.128 --> 01:11:11.378
What is this, what is this?

01:11:14.024 --> 01:11:16.191
(panting)

01:11:17.854 --> 01:11:20.104
(cracking)

01:11:23.168 --> 01:11:24.942
Hold up, hold up, look, look, look, look.

01:11:24.942 --> 01:11:28.011
Look, look, please, please, please.

01:11:28.011 --> 01:11:30.022
Look, I don't want any problems, okay?

01:11:30.022 --> 01:11:31.267
I don't want any problems.

01:11:31.267 --> 01:11:34.423
I just want to go home,
I just want to go home.

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:37.673
No, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:11:39.134 --> 01:11:40.372
Look, look, look, I swear to god,

01:11:40.372 --> 01:11:44.392
we won't tell anyone
about you, please, please!

01:11:44.392 --> 01:11:46.725
Please, man, please, please.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.593
Oh.

01:11:49.593 --> 01:11:50.562
Ah! (screaming)

01:11:50.562 --> 01:11:53.562
- He screamed, and it all got quiet.

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:59.454
- How do you know all that?

01:11:59.454 --> 01:12:02.121
I need to know how you got away.

01:12:03.731 --> 01:12:06.731
(suspenseful music)

01:12:08.535 --> 01:12:10.785
(groaning)

01:12:16.314 --> 01:12:19.314
(suspenseful music)

01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:41.483
- Where's Scott?

01:12:43.027 --> 01:12:44.777
Where the hell is he?

01:12:53.085 --> 01:12:54.403
Stop.

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:55.236
Stop!

01:12:58.151 --> 01:13:01.104
You better not miss, you fuck!

01:13:01.104 --> 01:13:03.354
(groaning)

01:13:09.358 --> 01:13:11.608
(groaning)

01:13:15.283 --> 01:13:18.200
(thunder cracking)

01:13:26.721 --> 01:13:28.971
(groaning)

01:13:31.587 --> 01:13:32.420
(crunching)

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:36.837
This is for my brother! (grunts)

01:13:36.837 --> 01:13:41.837
(thunder cracking)
(rain pouring)

01:14:01.712 --> 01:14:04.488
(groaning)

01:14:04.488 --> 01:14:07.071
(somber music)

01:14:18.961 --> 01:14:21.044
(crying)

01:14:26.225 --> 01:14:28.975
- And where'd you get the antler?

01:14:30.646 --> 01:14:33.616
- I found it in the woods
after I lit the fire.

01:14:33.616 --> 01:14:35.118
- And you stabbed him?

01:14:35.118 --> 01:14:35.951
- Yes.

01:14:35.951 --> 01:14:38.169
- [Walters] This guy in
the furs, you stabbed him

01:14:38.169 --> 01:14:39.150
with the antler?

01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:40.727
- Yes, I stabbed him in the stomach.

01:14:40.727 --> 01:14:41.988
- [Walters] And there was blood?

01:14:41.988 --> 01:14:43.335
- I guess.

01:14:43.335 --> 01:14:45.807
- Okay, Mr. Stevens.

01:14:45.807 --> 01:14:47.556
I just have one last question then we can

01:14:47.556 --> 01:14:49.770
get you outta here.

01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:51.460
Why was it so personal between you

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:53.139
and the man with the furs?

01:14:53.139 --> 01:14:54.804
- What do you mean?

01:14:54.804 --> 01:14:59.072
- Amy was your wife,
Kevin was your brother.

01:14:59.072 --> 01:15:02.873
He came for you and yours again and again.

01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:04.570
- Where are you getting at?

01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:07.356
- Home come the only people
who seen this guy are dead?

01:15:07.356 --> 01:15:09.823
- You don't think I had
anything to do with this,

01:15:09.823 --> 01:15:11.032
with Amy's murder?

01:15:11.032 --> 01:15:12.412
- [Walters] And Kevin's?

01:15:12.412 --> 01:15:14.434
- [Derek] You gotta be shitting me?

01:15:14.434 --> 01:15:16.434
- [Walters] No, I don't.

01:15:17.437 --> 01:15:19.391
- You know, I'm not lying, okay?

01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:21.880
I'm not making this up.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:24.520
- Derek, you already
admitted to everything.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.444
- What?

01:15:25.444 --> 01:15:27.743
- And you had motive.

01:15:27.743 --> 01:15:29.985
She was pregnant with another man's child.

01:15:29.985 --> 01:15:32.207
- [Derek] I didn't know that.

01:15:32.207 --> 01:15:36.857
- Hm, and you brought your
estranged brother to the island.

01:15:36.857 --> 01:15:41.162
- Look, I hated Kevin,
but I didn't kill him.

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:42.628
- You expect me for me to believe

01:15:42.628 --> 01:15:46.227
that Kevin just took a spear to the back?

01:15:46.227 --> 01:15:50.908
I read his file, he was a
decorated combat veteran.

01:15:50.908 --> 01:15:54.257
There's no way he went
down without a fight.

01:15:54.257 --> 01:15:56.096
You didn't hurt your leg by accidentally

01:15:56.096 --> 01:15:57.178
falling down a hill!

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:58.671
- Just stop!

01:15:58.671 --> 01:16:02.979
- You were there when the food
and the guns went missing,

01:16:02.979 --> 01:16:05.633
the guns that weren't used on any of you.

01:16:05.633 --> 01:16:07.476
You're the only one
who ever saw this crazy

01:16:07.476 --> 01:16:08.925
mountain man in furs.
- No, no, no.

01:16:08.925 --> 01:16:12.397
That's all circumstantial,
that's my word against yours.

01:16:12.397 --> 01:16:13.969
- My what?

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:16.416
(knocking)

01:16:16.416 --> 01:16:17.656
- [Walters] Come in.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:18.656
- Thank you.

01:16:23.494 --> 01:16:24.327
- Derek.

01:16:26.781 --> 01:16:29.188
I thought you were still in the hospital.

01:16:29.188 --> 01:16:31.605
- It's your word against his.

01:16:33.146 --> 01:16:35.158
- You said you couldn't find him.

01:16:35.158 --> 01:16:37.991
- We didn't find him, he found us.

01:16:39.675 --> 01:16:41.551
- You son of a bitch.

01:16:41.551 --> 01:16:43.593
- What?
- What did he say to you?

01:16:43.593 --> 01:16:45.156
- That you made up the mountain man.

01:16:45.156 --> 01:16:47.186
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not what I said.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:49.781
- That you were the only
one who ever really saw him.

01:16:49.781 --> 01:16:50.614
- No, that--

01:16:50.614 --> 01:16:53.022
- You told Scott about
him, about everything.

01:16:53.022 --> 01:16:55.179
- You're twisting my words.

01:16:55.179 --> 01:16:58.785
- The foregone conclusion here
is that you're the villain.

01:16:58.785 --> 01:16:59.618
- Derek, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:59.618 --> 01:17:00.451
- That's bullshit.

01:17:00.451 --> 01:17:02.745
By that logic, Scott killed him.

01:17:02.745 --> 01:17:05.206
Scott, you son of a.

01:17:05.206 --> 01:17:07.131
You killed my brother!

01:17:07.131 --> 01:17:08.308
- How could you think that, man?

01:17:08.308 --> 01:17:09.161
- You killed Kevin!

01:17:09.161 --> 01:17:11.277
- How could you think that I killed Kevin?

01:17:11.277 --> 01:17:12.579
- [Derek] You're the one that told me

01:17:12.579 --> 01:17:13.961
to bring Kevin there, all right?

01:17:13.961 --> 01:17:15.800
If it wasn't for you, he woulda
never been on that island!

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.776
- You hated that bastard
since we were kids!

01:17:17.776 --> 01:17:20.532
- But your were the only
gun that wasn't missing.

01:17:20.532 --> 01:17:23.475
- Oh my god, my little
pathetic piece of shit.

01:17:23.475 --> 01:17:24.327
- Yeah.
- The thing you said

01:17:24.327 --> 01:17:26.252
couldn't do any kinda damage?

01:17:26.252 --> 01:17:27.486
- You sided with Kevin and you wanted

01:17:27.486 --> 01:17:29.427
to leave the beach, right?

01:17:29.427 --> 01:17:31.197
Why would you wanna do that, huh?

01:17:31.197 --> 01:17:32.690
What were you afraid I might find?

01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:33.523
- I don't know, Derek.

01:17:33.523 --> 01:17:36.308
Why were you so willing
to leave that wreck, huh?

01:17:36.308 --> 01:17:38.571
You know, what were you afraid we'd find?

01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:40.163
- You ran into Kevin, you
said he pulled a knife

01:17:40.163 --> 01:17:42.897
on you, right, but he didn't, did he?

01:17:42.897 --> 01:17:44.802
You made all that shit up.

01:17:44.802 --> 01:17:45.722
Huh, huh?

01:17:45.722 --> 01:17:46.912
How did you find the old wreck?

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:48.381
- I was lost trying to find you!

01:17:48.381 --> 01:17:50.831
- No, you weren't lost, you were alone!

01:17:50.831 --> 01:17:52.879
(suspenseful music)

01:17:52.879 --> 01:17:54.712
You were always alone.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.639
- [Walters] He does have a point, Scott.

01:18:01.639 --> 01:18:02.622
- I was lost!

01:18:02.622 --> 01:18:04.646
- No, you weren't lost.

01:18:04.646 --> 01:18:05.746
You were always alone.

01:18:05.746 --> 01:18:07.063
- So were you, asshole!

01:18:07.063 --> 01:18:08.072
- No, fuck you!

01:18:08.072 --> 01:18:09.725
- You know what, I never saw the guy,

01:18:09.725 --> 01:18:11.854
this guy that you're blaming
for all this bullshit, Derek.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:12.753
I never saw him.

01:18:12.753 --> 01:18:13.586
- She was my wife!

01:18:13.586 --> 01:18:16.634
- And she was pregnant
with another guy's baby.

01:18:16.634 --> 01:18:18.156
Is that why you killed her?

01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:19.356
- I'm done, all right, I'm done!

01:18:19.356 --> 01:18:20.189
- Oh, just like that?
- Yeah.

01:18:20.189 --> 01:18:21.022
- Just like that.

01:18:21.022 --> 01:18:23.618
Well, that's too damn
bad for Amy and my kid

01:18:23.618 --> 01:18:25.305
that you just couldn't walk away from it--

01:18:25.305 --> 01:18:26.138
(fist smashing)

01:18:26.138 --> 01:18:27.345
- [Walters] Hey!
(Scott groans)

01:18:27.345 --> 01:18:28.428
Knock it off!

01:18:29.527 --> 01:18:32.110
Sit your ass down, both of you!

01:18:33.658 --> 01:18:34.491
Sit down!

01:18:48.508 --> 01:18:51.837
I guess you didn't stab
him in the stomach.

01:18:51.837 --> 01:18:54.717
Do you know what murder in concert is?

01:18:54.717 --> 01:18:56.949
- I want my lawyer.

01:18:56.949 --> 01:19:01.337
- I think that's a very
good idea, Mr. Stevens.

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:02.170
- What?

01:19:04.579 --> 01:19:07.508
- It's confusing, your stories.

01:19:07.508 --> 01:19:10.327
It's such a mess that
it would take me weeks

01:19:10.327 --> 01:19:14.660
to untangle the threads
enough just to put one free.

01:19:15.756 --> 01:19:17.929
Luckily, I don't have to.

01:19:17.929 --> 01:19:19.381
- Wait, what are you talking about?

01:19:19.381 --> 01:19:20.381
- Collusion.

01:19:24.351 --> 01:19:28.428
My daughter's favorite phrase
is, "Keep it simple, stupid."

01:19:28.428 --> 01:19:31.102
And I can't get her to stop saying it,

01:19:31.102 --> 01:19:33.862
but it's rather fitting.

01:19:33.862 --> 01:19:35.958
A crazy mountain man in furs.

01:19:35.958 --> 01:19:38.311
- But there's no evidence!

01:19:38.311 --> 01:19:40.579
- Maybe Amy was an accident.

01:19:40.579 --> 01:19:43.303
Or maybe you never meant to kill Kevin,

01:19:43.303 --> 01:19:45.967
but he was there, and he was in the way.

01:19:45.967 --> 01:19:50.024
And maybe he found out
about what you did to Amy.

01:19:50.024 --> 01:19:51.043
It doesn't matter.

01:19:51.043 --> 01:19:53.957
Either way, I'm charging you both

01:19:53.957 --> 01:19:57.122
with the murder of Amy and Kevin Stevens.

01:19:57.122 --> 01:19:59.926
I have bodies, weapons, and suspects.

01:19:59.926 --> 01:20:02.845
And rain doesn't wash away everything.

01:20:02.845 --> 01:20:05.762
All signs point to the both of you.

01:20:06.804 --> 01:20:10.387
So if you wanna come
clean, now's the time.

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:15.343
- What about the antler?

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:16.176
Did you find the antler?

01:20:16.176 --> 01:20:17.731
- Shut up!

01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:19.822
- It'll prove that there was
someone else on the island.

01:20:19.822 --> 01:20:22.823
She's about to charge
us with murder, Derek.

01:20:22.823 --> 01:20:25.106
- [Walters] I am happy that you knew

01:20:25.106 --> 01:20:27.439
about the antler too, Scott.

01:20:29.623 --> 01:20:30.943
Don't forget.

01:20:30.943 --> 01:20:33.776
Both of you will get a phone call.

01:20:38.332 --> 01:20:40.373
(heels clacking)

01:20:40.373 --> 01:20:42.040
Don't drop the soap.

01:20:43.090 --> 01:20:45.757
(door creaking)

01:20:56.127 --> 01:20:56.960
- Oh shit.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.778
(bird calling)

01:21:15.315 --> 01:21:18.315
(suspenseful music)

01:22:00.208 --> 01:22:03.208
