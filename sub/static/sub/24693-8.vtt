00:00.041 --> 00:05.099
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

00:05.566 --> 00:08.231
In New York City's war on crime,

00:08.231 --> 00:11.463
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.463 --> 00:13.171
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.171 --> 00:15.371
These are their stories.

00:17.233 --> 00:21.378
We're a team and we're goin' places.

00:21.378 --> 00:23.067
We're not goin' there alone.

00:29.005 --> 00:30.630
A lot of talk right now.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.352
It's tough to get those voices
out of our heads.

00:33.352 --> 00:36.211
I know some of us are hearing
what they're sayin',

00:36.211 --> 00:38.963
thinkin' about what's gonna
happen down at that courthouse.

00:39.366 --> 00:43.850
These ivy league football players
are guilty of a brutal assault.

00:43.850 --> 00:48.885
Our defense is solid
if we stick together.

00:48.885 --> 00:51.255
And no one is getting special treatment

00:51.255 --> 00:56.424
whether they can run a ball or
make a tackle... not on my watch.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.198
Do you expect an indictment
from the grand jury today?

01:02.364 --> 01:04.251
Hi, Carla.

01:04.635 --> 01:08.325
No, I... yeah, all right.
Bye, girl.

01:10.703 --> 01:12.853
Traci's cool, right?

01:13.456 --> 01:15.047
Carla!

01:15.769 --> 01:17.904
She's just nervous, all right?
Don't be mad.

01:17.904 --> 01:20.120
Them bastards ain't gettin' away with it.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.136
No, Benjy. Wait!

01:22.136 --> 01:24.646
We gain our ground by inches.

01:27.198 --> 01:28.981
Do you have any comment
to your accuser?

01:28.981 --> 01:31.544
Do you still maintain your innocence?

01:31.544 --> 01:33.416
The rape victim is from your community.

01:33.416 --> 01:36.040
Do you feel a personal obligation to prosecute?

01:36.040 --> 01:38.840
I was born in the Bronx.
I grew up here.

01:38.840 --> 01:43.537
This neighborhood is poor and proud.
We take care of each other.

01:43.537 --> 01:46.311
And the Bronx is not going to tolerate

01:46.311 --> 01:52.242
one of our own being victimized
by these arrogant sons of privilege.

01:53.503 --> 01:55.280
Hello?

01:56.475 --> 01:57.529
Hello?

01:57.529 --> 02:00.733
- Traci Kwon here yet?
- No. She's not answering her phone.

02:00.733 --> 02:03.833
I asked Gates to run by her place.

02:09.205 --> 02:11.250
We protect each other.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.156
Whatever comes at us,

02:13.156 --> 02:15.397
keep your heads up... stay strong!

02:15.397 --> 02:18.988
And that, gentlemen,
is how we win!

02:18.988 --> 02:21.535
- Are we gonna win?
- Yeah!

02:23.184 --> 02:24.479
- Are we gonna win?
- Yeah!

02:24.479 --> 02:26.644
- We gonna win?
- Yah!

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.159 --> 02:35.999
Oh, no.

03:25.217 --> 03:27.072
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2007/11/29

03:29.128 --> 03:31.907
Good morning, ladies, gentlemen.
Thanks for coming.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.098
One question, Mr. Hoyle.

03:33.098 --> 03:35.766
I'll take your questions,
but I just first wanna say

03:35.766 --> 03:39.149
that Traci Kwon's murder is
a terrible tragedy.

03:39.149 --> 03:41.960
And we will find out who did this.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.891
Do you still expect an indictment
in the Newell rape case?

03:43.891 --> 03:46.978
Major Case. / The heart of our case
is the testimony of the victim.

03:46.978 --> 03:49.605
She's not going to be intimidated
into any kind of silence.

03:49.605 --> 03:52.865
Did one of the accused football players
kill Traci Kwon?

03:52.865 --> 03:55.932
Whoever did this, they can run,

03:55.932 --> 03:57.945
but they cannot hide.

03:57.945 --> 03:59.289
That's enough. Thank you.

03:59.289 --> 04:01.019
Thank you very much.

04:04.037 --> 04:06.923
Well, well, well. Join the party, Falacci.

04:06.923 --> 04:09.098
- How'd I beat you here?
- Media gridlock.

04:09.098 --> 04:12.868
ADA Hoyle's making the most of his
ten minutes. What a prima donna.

04:12.868 --> 04:17.846
Meet detective investigator Gates.
Hoyle's his boss. / Oh.

04:17.846 --> 04:20.846
Hoyle loves the cameras,
but he's a stand-up prosecutor.

04:20.846 --> 04:22.447
You're retired NYPD?

04:22.447 --> 04:24.311
Working a second career in the DA's office.

04:24.311 --> 04:26.799
It's nice. I get a car.

04:26.799 --> 04:29.851
Gates found the body. Upstairs.

04:30.944 --> 04:32.868
Traci Kwon was your key witness?

04:32.868 --> 04:35.216
- You familiar with the case?
- Just what I read in the papers.

04:35.216 --> 04:38.691
Traci and another stripper were performing
at the Newell football team party.

04:38.691 --> 04:40.822
The other stripper alleges
she's been raped.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.875
Hoyle's making the entire team suspects.

04:42.875 --> 04:45.884
Traci was late for the grand jury.
I was sent to knock on her door,

04:45.884 --> 04:49.749
found the poor kid lying here.
DOA.

04:52.129 --> 04:56.393
She went down head first
with force behind the fall.

04:56.393 --> 04:58.624
She still has her jewelry.

04:58.624 --> 05:00.344
But no purse.

05:00.344 --> 05:03.347
And the apartment was ransacked.

05:03.347 --> 05:06.212
Kind of a mixed message, huh?

05:08.789 --> 05:12.623
Well, it's tough to tell what's gone.
She didn't have much to begin with.

05:12.623 --> 05:15.125
How'd they get in the building?
The front door's locked.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.083
Neighbors all heard the intercom.

05:17.083 --> 05:21.003
The old lady in 309 never asks,
just buzzes people up.

05:21.003 --> 05:23.125
- Rush job.
- Yeah.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.283
All the drawers are open.

05:27.229 --> 05:30.812
They left cash.
Wedding fund.

05:37.262 --> 05:41.106
Someone didn't want Traci
talking to the grand jury.

05:41.594 --> 05:44.562
Who knew she was testifying today?

05:45.307 --> 05:47.150
Wouldn't have been hard to figure out.

05:47.150 --> 05:49.275
Even for football players?

05:49.275 --> 05:51.845
Gonna need the names of
all those accused, by the way.

05:51.845 --> 05:53.961
I can't talk about the case.

05:53.961 --> 05:57.179
You're turning this into a turf war?
It's a murder investigation.

05:57.179 --> 05:59.874
Of a witness in a Bronx ADA's case.

05:59.874 --> 06:03.493
Hoyle finds out I'm talking to you,
I'm on the street.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.403
Let me walk you out.

06:09.756 --> 06:11.191
Listen.

06:12.020 --> 06:16.548
I know you're under orders.
But come on. We're both on the job here.

06:16.548 --> 06:18.615
You like that girl, right?

06:18.615 --> 06:21.511
You gonna let her killer get a head start?

06:22.888 --> 06:25.372
You see her friend here?

06:25.372 --> 06:27.514
Just give me a name.

06:28.866 --> 06:33.357
Nothing says that my partner and I
didn't get it here on our own.

06:39.815 --> 06:43.088
Traci called this morning at 8:00.

06:43.088 --> 06:46.091
I told her testifying was no big deal.

06:46.091 --> 06:47.686
Is that why she was killed?

06:47.686 --> 06:50.638
Well, if you give us the name of the players
who attacked you, we'll find out.

06:50.638 --> 06:51.837
I can't.

06:51.837 --> 06:55.506
Mr. Hoyle told me not to talk to NYPD.
Just to his office.

06:55.506 --> 06:59.399
Carla, your friend was thrown down
a flight of stairs.

06:59.399 --> 07:01.879
It could've been anyone on that team.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.004
They stick up for each other.
They lie.

07:04.004 --> 07:06.388
Well, look, if you know who did this,
you better tell us

07:06.388 --> 07:08.278
because your girlfriend could be next.

07:08.278 --> 07:10.016
If the cowards even...

07:10.016 --> 07:13.690
Oh, god, I'll kill 'em!
I swear to god I'll kill them.

07:17.537 --> 07:21.303
Traci though, she was alone.

07:21.725 --> 07:25.584
No roommate.
Vulnerable.

07:25.802 --> 07:29.466
- No friends looking out for her.
- That's not true.

07:29.850 --> 07:34.649
Look, Traci was having trouble at work.
I told her Benjy would pick her up.

07:35.904 --> 07:38.332
She said she didn't
want to be any trouble.

07:38.332 --> 07:42.230
Pick her up where?
Where she danced?

07:45.106 --> 07:47.311
Traci worked as a cocktail waitress.

07:47.311 --> 07:50.288
She tried performing one night.
Didn't last two minutes.

07:50.288 --> 07:53.041
How'd she end up stripping
at the Newell football party?

07:53.041 --> 07:56.189
I have no idea. We don't sanction
off-premises work of any kind.

07:56.189 --> 07:59.214
Well, we understand Traci may
have been harassed here.

07:59.214 --> 08:00.355
News to me.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.427
We take care of our girls here.
This is not that kind of place.

08:03.427 --> 08:07.492
Oh? Is it the kind of place
that serves underage kids?

08:07.492 --> 08:09.967
'Cause if I asked those two sitting
over there for ID,

08:09.967 --> 08:12.718
are they gonna show me
their out of state library card?

08:12.718 --> 08:14.414
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

08:14.414 --> 08:17.733
Listen. Last week,
there was an incident.

08:17.733 --> 08:20.559
- What kind of an incident?
- Some college kids came in.

08:20.559 --> 08:22.617
They were bothering Traci.
They wouldn't let up.

08:22.617 --> 08:24.613
She tried to get away.
Her skirt got ripped.

08:24.613 --> 08:27.686
College kids. From Newell?

08:27.686 --> 08:29.554
This is a Dominican neighborhood.

08:29.554 --> 08:32.972
Those rich white brats come
down from the hill, no mistake.

08:32.972 --> 08:37.144
We're gonna want every single name
of those rich white brats, okay?

08:37.467 --> 08:40.664
I'll get my bookkeeper.
She'll pull up the credit card receipts.

08:40.664 --> 08:44.687
Good. / You guys want to wait,
anything you want's on the house.

08:44.687 --> 08:48.905
- Yeah, well...
- Yeah, just give us a call.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.010
So Traci Kwon doesn't have
an enemy in the world

08:54.010 --> 08:56.875
except for the 90 players
in the Newell football team.

08:56.875 --> 08:58.684
Tough to cross that padded line.

08:58.684 --> 09:00.736
No one at the college is talking.

09:00.736 --> 09:03.784
You said she has a wedding fund.
You find the fiance?

09:03.784 --> 09:06.119
Fort lauderdale.
He's on his way here.

09:06.119 --> 09:09.211
That's the third call I've made
to the Bronx DA's office.

09:09.211 --> 09:11.727
They're still saying,
"we'll get back to you."

09:11.727 --> 09:14.080
I've worked with Hoyle.
He's territorial.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.661
Or maybe his case isn't as strong
as he's been selling it to the press.

09:17.661 --> 09:21.418
Might be more than that.
Bronx DA's retiring this year.

09:21.418 --> 09:23.957
Seat's up for grabs.
Hoyle's hoping to win.

09:23.957 --> 09:26.825
Hmm. A Dominican neighborhood.

09:26.825 --> 09:30.439
And a Dominican girl cries foul
on some white boys.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.410
Playing to local prejudice, huh?

09:32.410 --> 09:34.585
The Bronx is burning. Part two.

09:34.585 --> 09:37.188
And Hoyle's pouring on the gas.

09:37.554 --> 09:40.373
Let's give him till the end of the day.
Then I'll make a call.

09:40.373 --> 09:45.472
Vicuna club just pulled the credit receipt
on the guy who was manhandling Traci.

09:46.411 --> 09:51.151
What's a wall street broker
doing visiting a strip club in the Bronx?

09:51.685 --> 09:54.564
The Vicuna club?
Never heard of it.

09:54.564 --> 09:56.951
Was your credit card stolen, Mr. Danes?

09:56.951 --> 09:58.559
Not that I'm aware of.

09:58.559 --> 10:03.390
Well, your card was used
to pay for a $500 champagne table

10:03.390 --> 10:06.064
at a strip club in the Bronx.

10:07.447 --> 10:08.959
That's amusing.

10:08.959 --> 10:11.875
If I go to the Bronx, it's for the play-offs.

10:11.875 --> 10:16.511
And my driver keeps the limo running.
But thank you for alerting me.

10:16.511 --> 10:18.721
I'll have my assistant call the company.

10:18.721 --> 10:22.111
Can I help you with something, detective?

10:22.111 --> 10:25.921
- Where'd you go college?
- London school of economics. You?

10:25.921 --> 10:27.967
Looks like there was
a pennant hanging here.

10:27.967 --> 10:30.467
I didn't know that LSE had pennants.

10:30.467 --> 10:33.572
This photo looks lonesome.

10:33.790 --> 10:36.594
Like there were others missing.

10:37.882 --> 10:39.434
Hey, listen, my friend.

10:39.434 --> 10:42.553
I don't kneed an MBA to know
that you're covering for somebody.

10:42.553 --> 10:45.027
A football player at Newell?

10:47.530 --> 10:49.384
Okay.

10:49.384 --> 10:54.048
It's my stepson from my second marriage.
Sean McClure.

10:54.048 --> 10:57.897
I gave him a spare card to use
in case of emergencies.

10:59.967 --> 11:03.093
Oh, nice. Nice execution!

11:03.093 --> 11:06.765
That DA, he goes after one of us,
he goes after all of us.

11:06.765 --> 11:09.156
Still doesn't explain
why you were hounding Traci.

11:09.156 --> 11:12.022
No, we were talking to her.
I bought a bottle of champagne.

11:12.022 --> 11:14.943
We just wanted her to tell the truth.
There was no rape.

11:14.943 --> 11:16.524
Is that why you ripped her skirt?

11:16.524 --> 11:18.575
Now that was an accident.

11:18.575 --> 11:21.139
Look, I'm sorry that girl's dead,
but she was a liar.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.656
She could've sent any one of us
to prison for years.

11:23.656 --> 11:25.977
Why aren't you guys investigating that?

11:27.840 --> 11:29.937
Where were you Monday morning?

11:29.937 --> 11:32.429
Where we are every morning.
Practice.

11:32.429 --> 11:34.872
Can anybody verify that?

11:35.441 --> 11:36.911
Yeah. I can.

11:36.911 --> 11:40.170
Along with 88 of their teammates.
You're done here, gentlemen.

11:42.128 --> 11:43.925
I have a practice to run.

11:43.925 --> 11:46.603
You want to talk to any of my players,
call their lawyers.

11:46.603 --> 11:49.898
Telling them to lawyer up.
What a way to build character.

11:49.898 --> 11:53.578
You gonna walk off my field
or am I gonna have to toss you off?

11:55.544 --> 11:57.828
We'll be in touch, coach.

12:01.816 --> 12:03.615
Yo, yo, yo, Timbo.

12:03.615 --> 12:06.708
Timmy, Timmy, man, how come you
didn't call the lawyer my dad recommended?

12:06.708 --> 12:09.316
Well, your attorney wanted
a $5,000 retainer fee.

12:09.316 --> 12:11.930
- So get it from your parents.
- Yeah or whoever.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.247
Look, we're in deep here.

12:13.247 --> 12:15.660
I mean, you think this thing's
all gonna go away?

12:16.594 --> 12:21.338
Look, I'm not doing time.
Not for you, not for anybody.

12:21.338 --> 12:23.535
Now call the lawyer.

12:25.051 --> 12:27.204
Call the lawyer.

12:27.937 --> 12:29.781
Come on.

12:30.365 --> 12:32.443
What do they want?

12:33.238 --> 12:34.731
Don't worry about it, ma. I got it.

12:34.731 --> 12:36.439
Well, what do they want you to do?

12:36.439 --> 12:37.799
Want me to talk to an attorney.

12:37.799 --> 12:41.260
Those boys do not have your back, Tim.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.846
Don't go out of your way to
protect them. / I got it.

12:48.486 --> 12:51.052
Look, I'm here voluntarily.

12:51.052 --> 12:54.271
This rape case is bogus.

12:54.271 --> 12:56.987
Those girls. They were lame.

12:56.987 --> 12:58.656
I wouldn't do them if you paid me.

12:58.656 --> 13:00.633
Well, why did you hire them
in the first place?

13:00.633 --> 13:02.359
'cause they were cheap.

13:02.359 --> 13:04.813
Look, we should've just gone to scores.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.568
Detective.

13:07.568 --> 13:09.321
Wait there.

13:11.165 --> 13:14.672
This kid'll open up if I ask him
about the rape case.

13:14.672 --> 13:17.728
- You have to talk to Hoyle first.
- I thought you were calling him.

13:17.728 --> 13:20.331
We just spoke.
He's holding onto his files.

13:20.331 --> 13:23.565
But he's agreed to walk you two
through some details.

13:23.810 --> 13:25.877
Cut the kid loose.

13:29.704 --> 13:34.484
Detectives. Obviously I want
the NYPD to find Traci's killer.

13:34.484 --> 13:36.827
Then give us access to your files.

13:36.827 --> 13:39.040
- It's not that simple.
- Look.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.826
All due respect, a girl is dead here.

13:44.464 --> 13:46.834
Carla ID'd three players who raped her.

13:46.834 --> 13:49.560
Until I get an indictment,
I cannot give you my files.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.809
You interview my suspects,
you'll tip them off to what we know.

13:51.809 --> 13:53.932
Well, if your case is solid, it'll hold up.

13:53.932 --> 13:57.605
No, I'm not worried about my case.
I'm worried about Carla Sanchez.

13:57.605 --> 14:00.647
I already know you talked to her.
She's scared.

14:00.647 --> 14:02.869
I do not want to lose her.

14:03.966 --> 14:06.194
Gene, I need you to...

14:06.194 --> 14:10.280
Didn't I see you out front of Traci's apartment
at the press conference?

14:10.280 --> 14:14.668
Detectives, this is my wife Beth.
One of our press liaisons.

14:14.668 --> 14:16.681
It's nice to meet you.

14:16.681 --> 14:20.447
Gene. When you have a minute.

14:23.949 --> 14:27.730
You and your wife made it to
Traci's apartment awfully fast.

14:27.730 --> 14:30.018
When was the last time you
spoke to Traci?

14:30.018 --> 14:32.189
The day before at the courthouse.

14:32.189 --> 14:34.967
I prepped her on the, uh,
swearing in process.

14:34.967 --> 14:37.564
So what was Traci testifying to?

14:37.564 --> 14:40.571
Traci saw Carla dragged up the stairs.

14:40.948 --> 14:44.733
Carla Sanchez was not the only one
who was raped.

14:44.733 --> 14:46.869
Traci was too.

14:46.869 --> 14:49.554
I thought Traci was just a witness?

14:49.554 --> 14:52.210
She refused to press charges
on her own assault.

14:52.210 --> 14:54.506
Now she's gone, those thugs
will get away with that.

14:54.506 --> 14:58.293
Thugs? We're not the press, Mr. Hoyle.
You don't have to sell it to us.

14:58.293 --> 15:01.004
These boys have been told that they are
better than everyone their whole lives.

15:01.004 --> 15:03.682
We are being vilified in the press

15:03.682 --> 15:08.052
as if Newell's ball game or someone's
pro career was more important

15:08.052 --> 15:09.548
than what happened to those girls.

15:09.548 --> 15:12.250
So that's it, Mr. Hoyle.
No names. No numbers.

15:12.250 --> 15:14.289
Okay, we understand.

15:14.733 --> 15:18.525
After the indictment,
then we get everything.

15:18.525 --> 15:20.597
You have my word.

15:25.867 --> 15:31.201
Hoyle's more interested in making a name
for himself than he is in solving Traci's murder.

15:31.201 --> 15:33.814
Look, there's more to life
than just one case.

15:33.814 --> 15:36.774
Higher ups have an agenda.
You want 30 years in? Deal with it.

15:36.774 --> 15:39.653
Hey, people told me you were a hothead.

15:39.653 --> 15:44.017
Guys like Hoyle, you'd eat for breakfast.
What happened?

15:49.848 --> 15:53.966
After ten years on Staten Island,

15:54.830 --> 15:57.791
you learn to pick your battles.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.190
So according to Hoyle,
Traci was assaulted too.

16:12.190 --> 16:15.866
Yeah. And we're not getting anything else
until he has his indictment.

16:15.866 --> 16:19.586
All right, still no final autopsy
results on Traci.

16:19.586 --> 16:21.892
I'll tell Rodgers about Traci's rape.

16:21.892 --> 16:25.073
But tough to confirm two weeks
after the assault.

16:25.073 --> 16:29.246
Until then, drag in the entire Newell
football team. One by one.

16:29.246 --> 16:31.173
You know, we may not have to.

16:31.418 --> 16:35.955
There was something that Hoyle said
about the player's pro careers being threatened.

16:35.955 --> 16:38.012
That's gonna narrow the field.

16:38.012 --> 16:41.676
- How many players have NFL potential?
- Two or three.

16:41.676 --> 16:44.824
Sean McClure.
He's a good quarterback.

16:44.824 --> 16:48.327
But the running back, kid's a star.

16:49.193 --> 16:51.187
These your trophies, Mr. Pardue?

16:51.187 --> 16:53.675
My dad played running back too.

16:53.675 --> 16:56.064
I played for Newell before I went pro.

16:56.064 --> 16:59.093
'85 was my first season with the Jets...

16:59.093 --> 17:00.846
And last.

17:00.846 --> 17:04.085
I remember you.
You took a bullet in the back.

17:04.085 --> 17:05.777
We were in a bar.

17:05.777 --> 17:09.684
Curtis was protecting a woman
who was being harassed.

17:10.092 --> 17:11.704
I tried to stop him.

17:11.704 --> 17:15.027
But my husband always
has to do the right thing.

17:15.027 --> 17:17.598
He was shot by the woman's boyfriend.

17:17.598 --> 17:20.548
You said this is about
the girl who was killed, detectives?

17:20.548 --> 17:22.207
I don't know how we can help you.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.644
Tim.

17:23.644 --> 17:28.093
So you were at the practice Monday
morning with the other players?

17:28.093 --> 17:29.666
Yeah.

17:29.666 --> 17:32.728
Look, no one on our team is
a killer or a rapist.

17:32.728 --> 17:35.278
You sound awfully sure about that.

17:35.278 --> 17:37.132
You were at the party that night.

17:37.132 --> 17:41.213
My son is being targeted because
we can't afford a fancy lawyer.

17:41.213 --> 17:45.324
The DA thinks he'll cut a deal
and testify against his teammates.

17:45.324 --> 17:47.699
All he's ever wanted to do is tell the truth.

17:47.699 --> 17:50.775
Then now would be a good time.

17:52.774 --> 17:55.484
We just won homecoming.

17:55.484 --> 17:58.802
20 of us, we got some beers
and went back to the house.

17:58.802 --> 18:01.710
But the whole thing was a disaster.
The girls, they didn't want to be there.

18:01.710 --> 18:05.116
And, uh, the hispanic one,
she was all messed up.

18:05.116 --> 18:06.542
Messed up?
What do you mean by that?

18:06.542 --> 18:10.776
She was drunk and
she had bruises on her legs.

18:12.498 --> 18:14.723
Okay, look, a few of the guys,
they were being rude.

18:14.723 --> 18:17.661
They were making comments
like, "where are the white girls?"

18:17.661 --> 18:20.458
Okay, so the party turned sour.

18:20.458 --> 18:21.807
Then what happened?

18:21.807 --> 18:24.060
The asian girl was outside

18:24.060 --> 18:27.412
and the other one who was wasted,
she started yelling back.

18:27.412 --> 18:30.037
And then she just stumbled out.

18:30.478 --> 18:32.110
Nothin' happened.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.833
This the story you told Hoyle?

18:33.833 --> 18:36.197
You think Hoyle wants to hear Tim's story?

18:36.197 --> 18:37.879
He doesn't care about the truth.

18:37.879 --> 18:41.102
I gave him DNA.
My photo for a lineup.

18:41.102 --> 18:44.538
And then I volunteered to take
a lie detector test and they say no.

18:44.538 --> 18:47.045
They never took his statement.

18:48.159 --> 18:50.584
They never took his statement?

18:54.392 --> 18:58.207
Hoyle lectures us about children of privilege
and that's who he goes after?

18:58.207 --> 18:59.481
Who knows.

18:59.481 --> 19:02.040
But Hoyle must be going
after him for a reason, right?

19:02.040 --> 19:04.517
He's sounding more credible than Hoyle.

19:04.517 --> 19:06.087
Maybe.

19:06.470 --> 19:10.105
Kid's not gonna tell the whole story
in front of mom and pop though.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.746
In that family,

19:11.746 --> 19:15.778
they got everything to lose
if Tim doesn't become pro.

19:15.778 --> 19:17.556
I don't make him as a killer.

19:17.556 --> 19:20.053
Well, we got his DNA.

19:20.053 --> 19:22.980
If Rodgers makes a match on Traci's body,

19:22.980 --> 19:25.662
we'll get him into interrogation.

19:26.656 --> 19:29.930
Cause of death, fractured skull.

19:29.930 --> 19:33.086
- Intracranial hemorrhaging.
- Anything on the tox screen?

19:33.086 --> 19:34.771
Nope.

19:34.771 --> 19:38.892
And nothing under her nails.
And no sexual assault.

19:38.892 --> 19:41.419
Wait a second, Rodgers.
The rape happened two weeks ago.

19:41.419 --> 19:43.080
Couldn't the signs have disappeared?

19:43.080 --> 19:45.252
Logan, she wasn't raped.
Not vaginally.

19:45.252 --> 19:48.021
Not two weeks ago.
Not ever.

19:48.346 --> 19:50.269
Hymen is intact.

19:50.269 --> 19:53.883
As far as I can tell,
Traci was a virgin.

19:59.306 --> 20:01.868
Traci's a virgin?
That doesn't rule out a sexual assault.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.401
She wasn't pressing charges.

20:03.401 --> 20:06.038
Hoyle's trying to bolster
his case postmortem.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.648
Unless Traci or Carla lied.

20:07.648 --> 20:10.203
Maybe we should be asking
Hoyle these questions here.

20:10.203 --> 20:12.783
- Here? Falacci, what...
- Yeah, I know. Staten Island.

20:12.783 --> 20:15.775
No. Not Staten Island.
Rules of the game.

20:15.775 --> 20:18.709
You don't drag a senior ADA
into the station house.

20:18.709 --> 20:20.286
You do if he's stonewalling.

20:20.286 --> 20:23.114
Which is what happens
when people throw stones.

20:23.114 --> 20:24.695
I'll talk to Hoyle.

20:24.695 --> 20:26.334
When?

20:27.898 --> 20:29.590
There's Traci's fiance.

20:29.590 --> 20:33.001
Maybe you'll get lucky
and she told him the truth.

20:39.438 --> 20:42.030
We were saving ourselves for marriage.

20:42.030 --> 20:44.962
Her night job must have been
hard for you two.

20:44.962 --> 20:47.923
Traci had the lord's word in her heart.

20:48.251 --> 20:52.606
She knew he would understand.
We needed money for the wedding.

20:52.606 --> 20:56.524
Do you think that's why she took the job
dancing at the football party?

20:58.100 --> 21:00.685
I only found out afterwards.

21:00.685 --> 21:04.070
She called me crying from the school clinic.

21:05.476 --> 21:09.932
Carla's boyfriend works at the school
so Traci knew where to take her.

21:09.932 --> 21:12.634
Did Traci tell you
what happened to her that night?

21:12.634 --> 21:17.127
She said the guys were drunk and crude.

21:17.127 --> 21:19.498
That Carla was assaulted.

21:19.498 --> 21:22.473
What about Traci?
Was she okay?

21:22.473 --> 21:24.413
Yeah.

21:24.803 --> 21:26.911
She's smart.

21:27.130 --> 21:30.646
She ran outside before things
got out of hand.

21:33.515 --> 21:35.564
Okay.

21:35.564 --> 21:39.356
When was the last time
you spoke to Traci?

21:45.260 --> 21:48.520
The night before she died.

21:51.176 --> 21:54.485
We prayed together over the phone.

21:56.348 --> 22:01.363
She asked,
"if you take an oath,

22:01.363 --> 22:05.920
even if it's not on the bible,
are you swearing to god?"

22:11.540 --> 22:14.411
So, Gene, Traci Kwon.

22:14.411 --> 22:17.109
You told my detectives
she'd been raped, right?

22:17.109 --> 22:20.425
But the autopsy's conclusive.
She's a virgin.

22:20.425 --> 22:22.982
Doesn't mean she wasn't assaulted.

22:23.563 --> 22:26.837
There are things about this case
that I can't talk about.

22:26.837 --> 22:29.101
Not even to you.

22:31.975 --> 22:35.077
Carla told me that they got separated,

22:35.926 --> 22:37.899
that Traci had been raped too.

22:37.899 --> 22:41.500
Carla told you. Not Traci.

22:42.077 --> 22:45.611
This case, Gene, some people think
you're moving to trial too quickly.

22:45.611 --> 22:50.205
These kids, they have money, social connections,
their parents, their school.

22:50.205 --> 22:51.990
What does Carla have?
What did Traci have?

22:51.990 --> 22:55.488
I get it. Which is why we
should be working in tandem.

22:55.488 --> 22:58.113
Who knows? We might find something
makes your case a lock.

22:58.113 --> 23:00.305
I will level with you here.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.083
There is information in those files

23:03.083 --> 23:07.099
that if misinterpreted
by the wrong people will hurt Carla.

23:08.382 --> 23:13.416
No one's gonna see these files
but me and my detectives.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.842
Just a few questions about Carla Sanchez.

23:16.842 --> 23:18.860
I could get in trouble for talking to you.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.198
But what those players are
going through, it's not right.

23:21.198 --> 23:23.470
Okay. So you want to help
the football team, right?

23:23.470 --> 23:26.513
Yeah. / You treated
Carla Sanchez that night?

23:26.513 --> 23:28.838
Did what I could. She was drunk.

23:28.838 --> 23:31.430
Yeah. Well, she had a friend
who said she needed medical treatment.

23:31.430 --> 23:33.353
So there had to be somethin'
a little more to it.

23:33.353 --> 23:36.700
She had a few bruises on her arms and legs,
but they weren't fresh.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.770
She didn't tell you she'd been raped?

23:38.770 --> 23:41.187
Only after her boyfriend showed up.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.041
He was angry, jealous.

23:43.041 --> 23:45.573
If you ask me,
she was trying to get sympathy.

23:45.573 --> 23:47.439
And you told all this to Hoyle.

23:47.439 --> 23:49.784
The DA's office didn't want to hear from me.

23:49.784 --> 23:52.571
They had their own medical
expert to examine her.

23:52.571 --> 23:55.278
Look, we never had this conversation, okay?

23:55.278 --> 23:57.440
Sure. Sure thing.

23:58.215 --> 24:00.873
Wonder what team she's rooting for.

24:01.258 --> 24:05.123
Oh, Hoyle's files finally showed up.

24:05.123 --> 24:08.553
Love to have a look at what
his medical expert concluded.

24:08.553 --> 24:12.130
You go ahead.
I'll talk to Carla's boyfriend,

24:12.130 --> 24:13.963
get his side.

24:14.419 --> 24:16.332
I'm just tellin' you
what people were saying.

24:16.332 --> 24:19.192
Well, I'm telling you
whoever told you that is lying.

24:19.192 --> 24:21.799
So you didn't have a problem
with Carla stripping?

24:21.799 --> 24:24.854
No, man. It's just a job.

24:25.922 --> 24:29.935
- She's a good looking girl, Benjy.
- No, actually, she's beautiful.

24:32.224 --> 24:34.436
I would have a problem with that.

24:34.436 --> 24:37.690
Yeah, well, that's you.
You're old school.

24:37.690 --> 24:44.453
Still. All those snotty rich kids stickin' bills
in her G-string and doing god knows what else.

24:44.453 --> 24:47.484
- She like that kind of thing?
- Yo, shut up, man.

24:47.484 --> 24:49.291
That's my fiance you're talkin' about.

24:49.291 --> 24:52.915
- You're getting married.
- Yeah. I'm getting married.

24:52.915 --> 24:55.514
Huh. On a janitor's salary, huh?

24:55.514 --> 24:57.363
Well, maybe that's why
she was doing those parties.

24:57.363 --> 25:01.290
Screw you, man.
She's quittin' that, all right?

25:01.290 --> 25:04.929
We don't ever have to work ever again.
This mop is done.

25:04.929 --> 25:07.555
The lawyer said we got a slam dunk.

25:08.843 --> 25:12.156
Carla and Benjy hired an attorney?

25:12.156 --> 25:15.372
They're hoping to parlay her ordeal
into a big pay day.

25:15.372 --> 25:17.072
Well, good luck.

25:17.072 --> 25:20.602
I mean, I knew this case was weak,
but there was no lineup.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.615
Carla only looked at photos of team players.

25:23.615 --> 25:27.185
She picked out
Sean McClure and Brad Barrett.

25:27.185 --> 25:31.930
She didn't even say one of her assailants
was black until she picked out Tim Pardue.

25:32.328 --> 25:33.868
What about the rape kit?

25:33.868 --> 25:36.175
There was semen from two different men.

25:36.175 --> 25:41.412
Neither of whom matched the DNA
from any of the players on the Newell team.

25:41.412 --> 25:43.294
Complications.

25:43.294 --> 25:45.625
Hoyle's out on a limb.

25:45.882 --> 25:48.617
Explains why he was reluctant
to hand all this over.

25:48.617 --> 25:51.162
Oh, here's one other thing.

25:51.162 --> 25:53.446
This is Carla's statement, okay?

25:53.446 --> 25:58.400
Carla says she was dragged up the stairs
into a room on the right.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.912
Here's Traci's statement.

26:02.872 --> 26:05.534
- It's the same story word for word.
- Mm-hmm.

26:05.534 --> 26:09.599
And this is the police diagram
of the player's house.

26:09.599 --> 26:12.172
There are no rooms up the stairs to the right.

26:12.172 --> 26:15.302
All the rooms are to the left.
Traci didn't see a thing.

26:15.302 --> 26:17.887
She was just trying to vouch for her friend.

26:17.887 --> 26:19.664
Traci was an evangelical.

26:19.664 --> 26:23.575
Maybe she had a crisis of conscience
about lying under oath.

26:24.537 --> 26:27.376
Well, maybe Carla and Benjy
had a crisis too.

26:27.376 --> 26:30.290
About losing their civil suit.

26:32.723 --> 26:35.563
Traci wasn't gonna testify?
Where did you get that from?

26:35.563 --> 26:37.114
You didn't know?

26:37.114 --> 26:39.957
See, the thing is, you were on
the phone with Traci that morning.

26:39.957 --> 26:43.124
And an hour later,
Traci was found dead.

26:43.124 --> 26:46.155
Could be you went over there
in person. / What?

26:46.155 --> 26:48.740
I was at home on the phone with my mother.
You can check.

26:48.740 --> 26:53.088
Oh, okay. So it was Benjy who went
over to her. That makes more sense.

26:53.088 --> 26:55.213
No. No way.

26:55.213 --> 26:57.801
Well, Benjy left your place at 8:00

26:57.801 --> 27:01.712
and he didn't punch in
until almost 10:00.

27:01.712 --> 27:04.174
Gives him plenty of time to
push Traci down the stairs.

27:04.174 --> 27:07.223
No. Benjy had no idea.

27:12.686 --> 27:14.283
Okay.

27:14.792 --> 27:17.388
Okay, Traci called me the night before.

27:17.388 --> 27:19.803
Said she wasn't gonna
back me on the stand.

27:19.803 --> 27:24.529
It freaked me out.
But there's no way I told Benjy.

27:32.546 --> 27:35.393
So what if we hired a lawyer?

27:35.393 --> 27:38.441
Those guys raped Carla.

27:38.441 --> 27:40.181
And they gonna pay and the school too.

27:40.181 --> 27:42.679
Yeah, but it's really gonna
mess up your pay day

27:42.679 --> 27:44.846
if Traci backs down on her story.

27:44.846 --> 27:46.770
What are you talkin' about, man?

27:46.770 --> 27:48.730
- What are you talkin' about?
- Stop messin' with me.

27:48.730 --> 27:51.212
Hey, sit down! Hey, sit down!

27:51.547 --> 27:53.342
Sit down!

27:56.653 --> 27:59.551
Benjy's next door.
He's in real trouble here, Carla.

27:59.551 --> 28:02.877
He has no alibi, he has a motive,
and a temper

28:02.877 --> 28:05.609
That's why I didn't tell him.
He would've gone crazy.

28:05.609 --> 28:10.844
Oh, just like he would've gone crazy
if he found out you had sex with another man.

28:12.309 --> 28:15.990
We know you had sex
with two different men that day, Carla.

28:15.990 --> 28:20.290
Now assuming one of them was Benjy,
who was the other?

28:20.290 --> 28:23.394
One of the players who raped me.

28:24.367 --> 28:27.291
I guess Hoyle didn't tell you yet.

28:27.291 --> 28:33.013
'cause that DNA didn't match
any of the players on that team.

28:39.646 --> 28:42.422
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

28:42.422 --> 28:47.672
Please don't tell Benjy.
You gotta swear to me Benjy don't find out.

28:47.672 --> 28:49.540
Go on.

28:53.827 --> 28:58.490
It was Omar. He's my ex.

28:58.490 --> 29:02.001
Benjy didn't know I was still seeing him.

29:02.001 --> 29:05.557
But I went to Omar to tell him
that I wanted out, you know.

29:05.557 --> 29:10.070
And he just...
he just went off on me.

29:10.646 --> 29:13.504
He was the one who raped you.

29:13.504 --> 29:16.960
- And you didn't file a report?
- No.

29:17.759 --> 29:20.999
No, because I don't want Benjy to find out.

29:20.999 --> 29:26.812
You realized Benjy is going to
see the bruises, get suspicious,

29:26.812 --> 29:30.225
so you pinned the rape
on the Newell football team.

29:30.225 --> 29:33.473
Those guys treated us like garbage.

29:33.775 --> 29:35.937
I was upset.

29:35.937 --> 29:40.891
I had a couple of drinks.
I lost my balance. But...

29:40.891 --> 29:44.159
Did they help me?
No.

29:44.159 --> 29:50.452
No, those guys, they said I was an ugly
wetback who should go home to Mexico.

29:50.452 --> 29:53.264
I said, "I'm Dominican."

29:53.810 --> 29:56.427
They laughed.

29:56.427 --> 30:00.535
I took my money and I ran out of there.

30:02.473 --> 30:06.363
- Where was Traci during this?
- She was waiting outside.

30:06.363 --> 30:08.757
She wasn't ready to dance.

30:08.757 --> 30:12.204
I was shaking so bad.

30:12.204 --> 30:16.995
Traci took me to the clinic.
She took care of me.

30:16.995 --> 30:19.859
And you asked her to lie for you.

30:20.858 --> 30:24.578
Benjy wouldn't have believed me without her.

30:25.644 --> 30:27.955
I didn't want to call the cops.

30:27.955 --> 30:29.986
I didn't. But Benjy made me.

30:29.986 --> 30:35.828
When exactly did Traci tell you
she wasn't gonna lie on the stand?

30:36.048 --> 30:38.711
It was the night before.

30:39.429 --> 30:41.455
I called Mr. Hoyle at home.

30:41.455 --> 30:43.479
You called Hoyle?

30:44.524 --> 30:47.032
And said what to him?

30:47.032 --> 30:49.311
That Traci was changing her story.

30:49.311 --> 30:51.557
And what did he say to you?

30:52.666 --> 30:55.964
He said not to worry about it.

30:55.964 --> 30:58.644
He would take care of Traci.

31:04.962 --> 31:09.098
I'd expect perps and real estate agents
to lie to me, not ADA's.

31:09.098 --> 31:10.000
Back up.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.881
All we know is Carla told Hoyle that
Traci had an issue with her testimony.

31:13.881 --> 31:16.737
Yes. And then ten hours later,
Traci's murdered.

31:16.737 --> 31:20.037
He was already out on a ledge.
Hoyle didn't want his case blowing up.

31:20.037 --> 31:22.650
- So he kills his own witness.
- I don't know whether he's an idiot

31:22.650 --> 31:25.913
for believing that Carla was actually raped
by those boys in the first place

31:25.913 --> 31:28.634
or if he's just an opportunist
who thinks that...

31:28.634 --> 31:30.943
that press coverage is more important
than telling the truth.

31:30.943 --> 31:33.616
- Hold on, Falacci.
- What? Are you telling me to back down?

31:33.616 --> 31:36.368
I'm telling you to work another angle!

31:38.188 --> 31:39.855
I got one.

31:39.855 --> 31:42.709
Walter Gates.
He's been with the DA's office for years

31:42.709 --> 31:44.792
and he might just know
how far Hoyle would go.

31:44.792 --> 31:47.584
- Great. I'm being double-teamed.
- Look.

31:47.584 --> 31:50.874
You were right about Hoyle's case.
You may be right here.

31:50.874 --> 31:54.373
You play this guy like a perp,
he'll shut down.

31:54.822 --> 31:59.157
It's a question of... finesse, Falacci.

32:07.697 --> 32:09.508
Thank you.

32:09.508 --> 32:12.435
- Wasn't I right about the rib eye?
- Yeah.

32:12.435 --> 32:15.817
But you didn't ask me to lunch
because you wanted red meat, hmm?

32:15.817 --> 32:19.470
No, Gene, I need you to help me
understand something.

32:19.470 --> 32:22.984
Carla Sanchez told us she called you
the night before the murder

32:22.984 --> 32:25.865
to tell you Traci was
backing off her testimony.

32:25.865 --> 32:27.237
Yes, she did.

32:27.237 --> 32:30.848
And you didn't feel that was
worth mentioning to us?

32:30.848 --> 32:32.510
Come on, Dan.

32:32.510 --> 32:35.733
We've both had to talk witnesses back from
the edge after they've been intimidated.

32:35.733 --> 32:37.792
- So you spoke to Traci?
- Yeah. That night.

32:37.792 --> 32:40.793
I calmed her down.
Told her I'd see her at the courthouse.

32:40.793 --> 32:43.760
I had no reason to believe
she wouldn't testify.

32:43.760 --> 32:51.528
See, an outsider might think
that Traci's death was... fortuitous.

32:52.534 --> 32:55.604
And now you ask me where I was
when Traci was pushed down the stairs?

32:55.604 --> 32:58.391
Yeah. Something like that.

32:59.571 --> 33:01.935
I was conducting interviews.

33:01.935 --> 33:05.490
Come on. One of the players knew
we were closing the net.

33:05.490 --> 33:06.879
They threaten Traci,

33:06.879 --> 33:08.986
go to her apartment that morning
to finish the job.

33:08.986 --> 33:13.565
Yeah, but, see, Gene, we don't have anything
that puts a football player on the scene.

33:13.565 --> 33:16.145
And they're all alibiing their teammates.

33:16.145 --> 33:18.663
They're lying for each other.

33:19.932 --> 33:22.209
Come on. You know me.

33:22.209 --> 33:25.348
You think I'd pursue this,
I'm not positive they're guilty?

33:25.348 --> 33:30.500
I think, Gene, sometimes you're inside a case,
you don't see all the angles.

33:31.111 --> 33:32.810
Forget the coffee.
We'll take the check.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.739
Right away, sir.

33:37.317 --> 33:40.515
So Hoyle's trying to fork
some political hay with this case.

33:40.515 --> 33:43.850
- Doesn't mean those boys aren't guilty.
- Well, I've seen the evidence.

33:43.850 --> 33:46.605
Your boss wants to make this case
stick no matter what.

33:46.605 --> 33:49.002
He wants justice for those girls.

33:49.002 --> 33:50.629
Must've been a real blow

33:50.629 --> 33:54.673
when Hoyle found out Traci was gonna
testify she didn't see anything.

33:54.673 --> 33:57.807
He thought somebody on the team had
gotten to her. He was concerned.

33:57.807 --> 34:01.591
Concerned enough to get rid
of an uncooperative witness?

34:01.591 --> 34:03.943
Am I hearing
what I think I'm hearing?

34:03.943 --> 34:06.076
She's suggesting Hoyle killed Traci?

34:06.076 --> 34:08.976
Our captain's checking on
his alibi right now.

34:08.976 --> 34:11.482
You people in Major Case
are a piece of work.

34:11.482 --> 34:13.030
Next you'll be asking me.

34:13.030 --> 34:15.771
You're making Hoyle a suspect,
you're all wrong.

34:15.771 --> 34:19.936
Well, if not him and not you, who's left?

34:23.080 --> 34:26.092
His wife, Beth?

34:29.157 --> 34:33.534
Who wanted this case anyway?
Hoyle or his wife?

34:33.937 --> 34:36.806
Beth was all over the grand jury testimony.

34:36.806 --> 34:38.802
Who was asking what, when?

34:38.802 --> 34:42.353
She was the one who panicked
when Traci was running late.

34:43.543 --> 34:45.360
Who asked you to check on Traci?

34:45.360 --> 34:48.319
That woman doesn't ask, she orders.

34:48.319 --> 34:51.629
- She order you in person?
- Called me from her cell.

34:51.629 --> 34:55.222
I assumed she was passing
on a message from Hoyle.

34:56.277 --> 34:59.931
You're telling me Hoyle didn't
murder Traci, his wife did.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.448
Hoyle was in interviews all morning long.

35:02.448 --> 35:06.273
Turns out that Beth left the courthouse at 8:15,
didn't return for an hour.

35:06.273 --> 35:10.051
We pulled her cell phone records.
We pinpointed a call she made to Gates at 8:50,

35:10.051 --> 35:13.230
three blocks away from Traci's apartment.

35:13.230 --> 35:16.139
So the motive is her political
ambition, not his.

35:16.139 --> 35:18.172
She's a thwarted kingmaker.

35:18.172 --> 35:19.834
Gets engaged in law school

35:19.834 --> 35:22.791
dumps the guy after he fails
the bar exam for the second time.

35:22.791 --> 35:24.634
Trades up, marries an assemblyman,

35:24.634 --> 35:27.859
divorces him after he's arrested
in a public men's room.

35:27.859 --> 35:32.005
Then Beth meets Hoyle,
who, by the way, dumps his starter wife.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.265
He's got some charisma.
He just needs a kick-start.

35:34.265 --> 35:36.282
Along comes this case.
He gets launched.

35:36.282 --> 35:38.831
Until Traci remembers
her christian conscience.

35:38.831 --> 35:41.310
Beth panics, pushes her out of the way.

35:41.310 --> 35:44.370
This puzzle that we're
all trying to figure out,

35:44.370 --> 35:46.660
Beth is the one piece that fits.

35:46.660 --> 35:51.599
We're not gonna get an ADA or his wife
to come in without a warrant.

35:52.362 --> 35:54.704
Let's make Hoyle a peace offering.

35:54.704 --> 35:57.950
We'll tell him we're picking up Tim Pardue.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.811
And just in case the press is there,

35:59.811 --> 36:04.119
we want to make sure his office
shares credit for the arrest.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.377
I'm telling you, my boy is innocent.

36:14.377 --> 36:17.529
He didn't rape that girl.
How many times do I have to tell you that?

36:17.529 --> 36:20.024
Mom, this isn't about that.
It's a search warrant.

36:20.024 --> 36:21.522
Search warrant? For what?

36:21.522 --> 36:23.826
- They think I killed Traci Kwon.
- That's impossible.

36:23.826 --> 36:27.637
Whoever killed Traci, made it look like
a robbery, took her purse.

36:27.637 --> 36:31.198
You can give us what you took from
the apartment or we can search ourselves.

36:31.198 --> 36:32.796
And you need the DA for that?

36:32.796 --> 36:34.722
Traci was a witness in our case.

36:34.722 --> 36:37.252
- My son didn't kill anybody.
- I was at practice all morning.

36:37.252 --> 36:39.255
Right. When was that again?

36:39.255 --> 36:41.210
From 8:00 till 10:00.
I got 100 witnesses.

36:41.210 --> 36:43.836
- I'm sure you do.
- I will not let you do this.

36:43.836 --> 36:46.349
Hold on. I just want to hear
his side, okay?

36:46.349 --> 36:48.921
Trying to get a fix on the time line,
that's all.

36:48.921 --> 36:51.193
- When was Traci due in court?
- 9:00.

36:51.193 --> 36:53.248
We were very worried
when she didn't show.

36:53.248 --> 36:55.728
And that's why you called Mr. Gates.
Which one of you did that?

36:55.728 --> 36:58.227
I did.
My husband was in interviews.

36:58.227 --> 36:59.871
And what time was that?

36:59.871 --> 37:02.722
- You haven't checked his cell?
- Actually, we checked yours.

37:02.722 --> 37:06.737
You called Gates on your cell at 8:50.

37:06.737 --> 37:09.932
Why didn't you just use the office phone
in the courthouse?

37:09.932 --> 37:14.852
Because, obviously you know,
I wasn't in the courthouse.

37:16.942 --> 37:20.552
I was concerned about Traci.
I went over to check in on her.

37:20.552 --> 37:23.543
- What?
- Why'd you go over there?

37:23.543 --> 37:25.248
You were worried she'd change her mind?

37:25.248 --> 37:27.979
Witnesses get nervous.
I wanted to reassure her.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.401
I got over there and she was
dead on the landing.

37:30.401 --> 37:33.158
You just assumed she'd be nervous.

37:33.158 --> 37:37.376
Your husband already told us
Traci wasn't going to testify.

37:42.778 --> 37:45.493
He didn't tell you that?

37:46.876 --> 37:49.472
Traci wasn't going to testify?

37:49.472 --> 37:51.639
What's she saying?

37:51.956 --> 37:54.692
You lied to me.

37:55.658 --> 37:58.085
Oh, my god.

37:59.508 --> 38:01.551
You said she was going to bury my boy.

38:01.551 --> 38:03.863
They served the warrant. Let's go.
Let them do their search.

38:03.863 --> 38:07.237
Hold on. No one's going anywhere.

38:07.237 --> 38:12.219
Mrs. Pardue, what did she say to you?

38:12.649 --> 38:15.617
That night before the grand jury,
she came over.

38:15.617 --> 38:18.015
"as a friend," she said.

38:18.015 --> 38:20.616
She told me Traci was going
to testify the next morning

38:20.616 --> 38:22.672
and that would be the end of Tim.

38:22.672 --> 38:26.275
That those boys with the big shot lawyers,
they were gonna get off.

38:26.275 --> 38:30.333
And this was our last chance
for Tim to get in front.

38:30.333 --> 38:33.161
- Beth, what were you thinking?
- Tim is guilty of rape.

38:33.161 --> 38:34.813
I couldn't let him get away with that.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.419
What happened after Beth
came over, Mrs. Pardue?

38:37.419 --> 38:41.657
I begged him. I begged him
to make a deal to save himself.

38:41.657 --> 38:44.997
- But he refused.
- He's loyal.

38:44.997 --> 38:47.635
Ah, so loyal, the next morning,
he went over to Traci's and he killed her.

38:47.635 --> 38:49.273
No. He did not kill anyone.

38:49.273 --> 38:50.655
You're his mother. What else are you...

38:50.655 --> 38:52.200
Don't you dare!

38:52.200 --> 38:53.722
Hold it, hold it. Come here.

38:53.722 --> 38:57.138
Calm down.
All right. Calm down. Calm down.

38:57.409 --> 39:00.622
Now why should we believe you? You would
do anything to save your son, wouldn't you?

39:00.622 --> 39:02.832
You lying bitch.

39:02.832 --> 39:06.469
You made me believe
we didn't have a chance,

39:06.469 --> 39:12.423
that my son was going to go to prison for
the rest of his life for a crime he didn't commit.

39:12.423 --> 39:17.961
My son is not a rapist.
He's no murderer.

39:21.338 --> 39:22.998
How do you know that?

39:22.998 --> 39:26.347
He didn't do it.
He didn't do anything.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.199
Because you did.

39:32.729 --> 39:36.588
You killed Traci to protect your son,
didn't you, Mrs. Pardue?

39:37.356 --> 39:41.111
- That's crazy.
- Mama, tell them it's not true.

39:41.509 --> 39:44.099
Tell them it's not true.

39:47.328 --> 39:50.942
Look at your son.
He's got his whole life ahead of him.

39:50.942 --> 39:54.110
He doesn't have a record as of yet.

39:54.948 --> 39:57.664
I think you know where I'm going.

40:02.820 --> 40:04.534
Okay, fellas.

40:04.534 --> 40:07.457
I'm placing your son under arrest.

40:10.404 --> 40:11.847
No! No!

40:11.847 --> 40:15.379
It's all right. It's all right.
Back off. Back off. Back off.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.107
- It was me.
- What?

40:20.107 --> 40:21.851
Grace.

40:22.599 --> 40:26.582
I believed she was gonna cripple my boy.

40:27.246 --> 40:30.162
I couldn't let it happen.

40:30.787 --> 40:35.084
I went over to the apartment
to talk to her.

40:35.084 --> 40:37.032
She wouldn't let me in.

40:37.032 --> 40:40.013
So I just waited out in the hall for her.

40:40.013 --> 40:44.695
And when she came out,
she was standing at the top of the stairs.

40:46.445 --> 40:47.445
And?

40:52.631 --> 40:56.221
She never even got a chance
to tell the truth.

40:59.393 --> 41:00.113
Grace.

41:01.435 --> 41:03.274
I'm sorry, Curtis.

41:03.992 --> 41:07.117
I just couldn't watch it happen again.

41:09.187 --> 41:13.329
Sorry, Curtis. So sorry.

41:15.401 --> 41:17.376
I did what any cop would do.

41:17.376 --> 41:21.168
I tricked a suspect into trying
to make him confess.

41:21.168 --> 41:23.509
I didn't know she was going to
go over there and commit murder.

41:23.509 --> 41:26.568
- Well, that's what happened.
- I wanted to see justice done.

41:26.568 --> 41:30.347
I wanted to see a rapist confess.

41:30.347 --> 41:36.284
Tim Pardue is not a rapist.
Carla made the whole thing up.

41:43.622 --> 41:45.729
- This case is over.
- No, no, no. The case is not over. Gene...

41:45.729 --> 41:47.970
Not now, Beth!

41:51.274 --> 41:54.215
I am sorry, detectives.

41:55.931 --> 41:58.205
I didn't know.

41:58.205 --> 42:00.724
Don't tell us you're sorry.

42:01.020 --> 42:03.370
Tell them.
