01:39.308 --> 01:41.902
- Come on, easy. Easy, girl.
- Easy.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.196
- Easy.
- Good. That'll do it.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.069
- Steady.
- Good girl.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.195
Steady.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.660
Good girl! Good girl!

01:51.153 --> 01:54.157
This is a stubborn one, huh?

01:54.823 --> 01:56.496
Easy. Attagirl.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.168
There we go.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.837
Who's a clever girl, then?

03:48.186 --> 03:51.030
Come on, boy. Come here.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.617
Come on, boy.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.406
Come on.

04:52.667 --> 04:57.594
Come on. Easy does it, easy does it.
Come on.

04:57.672 --> 05:01.176
Steady there, boy. Steady, boy.
That's it. Nice and done now, isn't it?

05:05.013 --> 05:06.185
Hey, hey!

05:18.193 --> 05:19.695
Morning, Pop.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.535
Put your mark here.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.164
Good luck.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.005
Get the colt.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.384
Whoa, whoa.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.117
Easy. Hey.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.160
Now that's a beauty.

06:01.236 --> 06:05.912
Forget it, Ted. He's half thoroughbred.
Not got a day's work in him.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.959
Now there...

06:10.453 --> 06:12.831
There's your ticket.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.471
But look at him, Si.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.137
Look at that creature.

06:23.800 --> 06:28.556
Don't be daft. You need
something solid to plow a field.

06:28.638 --> 06:32.688
Yeah, but he's something else, that one.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.613
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
settle down, settle down.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.110
Horses on my right,

06:38.773 --> 06:40.616
men with money in their pockets
on my left.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.990
- It's the perfect combination.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.494
- Is Fred Goddard here?
- Yes, I's here!

06:46.781 --> 06:48.829
Good. More money than sense.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.835
- Dave Hill!
- I'm here, yes!

06:54.122 --> 06:56.295
Bugger off, you tight bastard.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.043
You've been coming here for 20 years,

06:58.126 --> 07:00.470
never bought so much
as a pork scratching!

07:16.811 --> 07:17.858
Come on.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.200
All right.
First up today, a gorgeous young horse.

07:22.525 --> 07:26.530
Prettiest young thing I've seen
since my wife on our wedding day.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.622
Let's get going, shall we?
Who wants this wonderful creature?

07:31.034 --> 07:32.707
One guinea!

07:33.161 --> 07:34.834
One guinea. One guinea.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.040
I thought you needed a plow horse,
Mr. Narracott.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.469
One guinea.
Any advance on one guinea?

07:40.543 --> 07:42.045
- Two guineas!
- Two guineas.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.172
- Three.
- Three guineas.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.054
Ted Narracott,
it's completely the wrong animal.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.977
Si Easton, I'm not gonna let
that bastard see me off.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.563
- Five guineas!
- Five guineas!

07:52.013 --> 07:53.481
- Six!
- Oh, for the love of...

07:53.556 --> 07:55.433
- Seven!
- Seven guineas.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.238
Greedy sod.
Thinks he can just buy anybody. Eight!

08:00.313 --> 08:02.816
Stop it. He's your landlord.
You can't be picking fights with him.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.822
- Ten guineas!
- Ten guineas.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.704
You haven't got the money.
Let's go home, let's have a pint.

08:07.779 --> 08:12.034
Eleven guineas, sir! From as good
a man <i>as</i> any in this town!

08:14.869 --> 08:17.042
Do I hear 12 guineas? Twelve guineas.

08:17.872 --> 08:21.126
That's top price for a working animal.
Ted, save it for the shire!

08:21.209 --> 08:24.463
There are big days and
there are small days. Which will it be?

08:24.546 --> 08:26.014
Do I hear any advance on 11 guineas?

08:26.089 --> 08:29.218
Just let him go, Dad.
I don't care for him. He's too jumpy.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.890
Shall we say 25?

08:33.013 --> 08:36.688
- Twenty-five guineas.
- He's got you there. Nice try, Ted.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.568
You were great, Mr. N.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.111
- Gave him a run for his money.
- Going, going...

08:40.186 --> 08:42.029
- Thirty!

08:42.105 --> 08:43.778
Thirty guineas!

08:44.232 --> 08:45.779
Thirty guineas.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.865
Thirty guineas.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.622
Going.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.124
Going.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.624
Gone! To Mr. Ted Narracott!

08:59.539 --> 09:01.883
What have you done, Ted?
What have you done?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.229
Here you are, Ted.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.651
Quite a beast there. What are you
gonna do with him on a working farm?

09:23.897 --> 09:28.073
I hope you got the rent, Ted.
I'll be around for it when it comes due.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.995
You're a fool, Ted.
And now Rosie will never forgive you.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.821
- What have you done?
- That's Mooney's colt.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.489
You were supposed to buy
a plow horse!

10:06.564 --> 10:08.407
You bought him?

10:08.525 --> 10:10.402
What'd you pay for him?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.659
How much, Ted Narracott?

10:13.738 --> 10:17.413
I won't tell you a lie,
though I would love to.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.536
Thirty guineas!

10:19.869 --> 10:21.041
Thirty guineas?

10:21.955 --> 10:25.880
He's not worth 10! Are you
out of your mind? What about the rent?

10:25.959 --> 10:29.839
He's a strong one, Rosie.
Look at the way he holds his head.

10:29.921 --> 10:33.016
How the hell are we gonna
pull anything with that'?

10:33.091 --> 10:35.685
Ted, you have to take him back.
You have to take him back right now.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.138
You have to get down on your knees
and beg for our money back.

10:38.221 --> 10:41.566
No. No, please, don't take him back.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.608
We can't take him back
until he's broken in.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.315
And how are you gonna train
a horse with that leg?

10:49.649 --> 10:50.946
I'll train him.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.862
You stay out of this, Albert.
You don't know nothing about horses.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.949
Please, Mum. Please, let me. I can do it.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.786
We have to keep him. No choice.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.838
Right. Well, you got one month
to break him in,

11:03.913 --> 11:06.291
or I'm taking him back myself.

11:08.126 --> 11:12.131
How'd you get to 30?
What other fool bid you up that high?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.974
It was Lyons.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.106
We're going to lose everything.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.777
After all we've been through,
we're going to lose it all.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.738
Don't worry, Mum. I'll raise him.
I'll raise him good.

11:31.816 --> 11:35.195
Well, you better. Go on, get started!

11:35.278 --> 11:40.205
See if a child can undo what your fool
of a father's done to this family of ours.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.288
Easy, boy. Easy. Easy.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.166
Right.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.377
Let's make a start then.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.840
It's oats.

12:33.336 --> 12:37.011
Very tasty, that is.
It's beef and gravy to us.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.601
Come on.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.132
I'll bet you're missing your mother.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.217
Look at you.

13:14.210 --> 13:18.340
First time without your mum.
First time away from home.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.560
But you're not alone, are you?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.396
In fact.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.225
'Cause I'm here.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.488
It's all right.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.991
All right.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.498
I'm going to call you Joey.
You understand?

13:44.365 --> 13:46.709
Joey. That's you.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.545
And I'm Albert.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.257
It's all right. You're mine now.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.002
You're mine.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.963
Good boy. Good boy.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.472
Good boy. Come on.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.023
Whoa.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.655
I want you to stay there, Joey.

14:58.648 --> 14:59.991
Stay.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.859
That's it.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.662
Good boy. That's it, you got it.

15:05.655 --> 15:06.907
Hey, look at him, Albie!

15:06.989 --> 15:09.492
He's playing Grandma's Footsteps!

15:11.577 --> 15:14.797
All right. Come on, Joey. Back you go.
Come on.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.546
Come on. Back you go. You're all right.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.923
That's it. Good boy. All right.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.510
You got to stay there. You understand?

15:27.677 --> 15:32.183
That's it. Good boy. Good boy.

15:33.057 --> 15:36.357
You've got it. Good boy.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.359
Good boy.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.365
Good.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.323
Now call him. Whistle.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.369
Come now, Joey.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.708
Come on.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.542
You can come now, Joey.

16:05.214 --> 16:08.388
- I don't think he fancies your owls.
- I read it in a story.

16:09.552 --> 16:12.556
It's how the Indians
used to summon their horses.

16:13.389 --> 16:18.691
Now, Joey, when I whistle,
you've got to come. Understand?

16:21.898 --> 16:25.573
My dad had a dog
who stayed when you called him.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.154
He used to run up behind you
when you weren't looking, and...

16:28.571 --> 16:30.323
He's not a dog.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.451
He's just puzzling it through.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.020
Will you look at you!

17:06.025 --> 17:07.071
Albie!

17:46.732 --> 17:49.576
There's only 15 here.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.155
The rest will come.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.993
You know by rights I could
take this farm back today, don't you?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.578
And I'm a great believer in my rights.

17:58.661 --> 17:59.787
It will come.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.835
If you drank less beer
and bought fewer horses,

18:04.917 --> 18:08.672
you might be able to
look your landlord in the eye, Narracott.

18:08.754 --> 18:12.930
I said I'll pay you.
We're going to plant the bottom field.

18:13.009 --> 18:16.013
The bottom field's rock hard.
Only stones down there.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.598
No. We're going to plow it.

18:19.515 --> 18:24.612
Just give me till the autumn. I'll pay
every penny I owe you, with interest.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.991
How are you going to plow it?
Not with that fancy animal of yours.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.695
He'll do it.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.451
You'll not get that one in a harness,
let alone pulling a plow,

18:34.530 --> 18:36.453
even drunk on a Tuesday night.
You know that.

18:36.532 --> 18:40.162
And I can't wait for the money,
there's a war coming.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.960
I promise you that field will be plowed.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.800
We'll plant it with turnips.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.307
The money will be yours
when harvest comes.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.975
Please, sir. Please.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.074
Very well.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.661
If that fancy plows that field,

19:13.736 --> 19:16.956
I'll give you till October
to set things straight.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.417
What if he doesn't?

19:24.664 --> 19:27.417
I'll take the horse on the day he fails.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.345
And I'll take your father's farm,
and give it to working men who can

19:31.420 --> 19:34.390
hold their pints and hold their heads
high in decent company.

19:34.465 --> 19:37.218
No, please. Sir, you can't do that.

19:37.301 --> 19:41.932
Now, now, lad. What?
Are you bladdered as well?

19:43.391 --> 19:48.113
Ted Narracott,
I've got you down in my book.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.325
- You can't harness him.
- He's got to be collared.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.287
You're scaring him, Dad!
You're scaring him.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.831
- He can't take a plow!
- He's got to plow!

20:41.490 --> 20:43.242
He won't be able to do it!

20:43.325 --> 20:45.248
He's too young.
He's not even been backed yet!

20:46.871 --> 20:48.088
Ted!

20:52.418 --> 20:57.345
It's all right, boy. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.764
I knew this would happen
<i>as</i> soon as I laid eyes on him.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.186
Ted, no.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.019
Ted, no!

21:06.098 --> 21:07.315
He's worth nothing to me.

21:07.391 --> 21:11.021
If he won't take the collar,
he's not worth a damn thing!

21:11.520 --> 21:13.363
- Dad?
- Move aside.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.737
Dad, stop!

21:19.445 --> 21:21.789
You shoot that horse, we have nothing.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.036
No!

21:28.704 --> 21:32.709
You were right what you said, Dad.
He'll do it.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.546
You told Lyons he'll plow that field,
and he will.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.926
You'll see.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.216
He'll show you.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.593
We'll show you.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.555
We'll get it done.

21:50.434 --> 21:51.731
Let go.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.112
Let go.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.822
Go back to the house.

22:06.450 --> 22:10.455
Some days are best forgotten.
Today ain't one of them. Come on.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.772
How are you today, Joey?

22:41.485 --> 22:43.738
I don't know much about life, boy,

22:43.821 --> 22:48.167
but I do know that there are big days
and there are small days.

22:48.951 --> 22:53.127
Most days are small days, and, well,
they don't matter much to anyone.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.503
But this...

22:58.127 --> 22:59.800
Well, this is a big one.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.215
This is our big day!

23:04.800 --> 23:07.303
It's cold out there,
so I'm going to take this off.

23:07.636 --> 23:11.140
If it's tough for you,
it should be tough for me, too.

23:13.392 --> 23:17.693
Now, I'm going to teach you
how to plow.

23:18.939 --> 23:22.113
And you're going to learn.
Is that understood?

23:23.235 --> 23:27.581
Then we can be together, which is
how I believe things are meant to be.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.669
Steady, boy.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.961
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.668
Come on. Come on.

23:42.504 --> 23:45.678
Now, boy. Easy. Easy.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.227
Look at me, Joey.

23:49.178 --> 23:50.350
See?

23:52.348 --> 23:53.520
See?

23:54.850 --> 23:57.603
You just got to put your nose through.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.198
That's it.

24:03.359 --> 24:07.205
See, you've got it. You've got it.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.707
Good boy.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.826
There.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.366
Too large, too rocky,
matted with grass roots.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.944
Even a sturdy plow horse
would never manage it alone.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.825
Yet he will, I say.

24:48.904 --> 24:52.408
You'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly
if Albert told you so.

24:52.491 --> 24:56.246
It's a fine thing, loyal to your mate,
even if he is a bit barmy.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.922
A team of two might manage,
given a month and good weather.

25:14.138 --> 25:17.062
Ted too squeamish to watch, is he?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.185
Of course he's watching.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.331
Come on.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.077
Come on.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.805
Well, you've raised him up
a true Narracott, Ted.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.262
Picture of his father, he is.

25:54.845 --> 25:58.691
Not a dollop of ordinary sense,
but that thick stubbornness

25:58.766 --> 26:02.111
that'll lead him to insist
on the impossible.

26:09.735 --> 26:13.114
Wasn't a farmer in Devon
didn't admire you, myself among them,

26:13.197 --> 26:15.040
leaving your brothers that fine farm

26:15.115 --> 26:19.040
and setting yourself at this stony patch
of unpromising ground.

26:20.162 --> 26:23.006
You've fettle enough for 20 men.

26:24.833 --> 26:28.087
But with a gimpy leg and the drinking...

26:28.170 --> 26:30.844
For the pain, isn't it, that you drink?

26:32.841 --> 26:37.017
None of us could have anticipated
an ending better than this.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.024
Makes me question
the wisdom of the charity

26:41.100 --> 26:42.943
that urged me to rent you this place,

26:43.018 --> 26:46.568
not only looking at you, me old pal,
but that pretty little wife of yours.

26:46.647 --> 26:49.070
Thought you were a spark, she did!

26:49.149 --> 26:53.996
And now your son's sinking into
the selfsame bog that's swallowing you.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.129
See, Joey?

27:02.204 --> 27:04.298
I got the collar, too!

27:06.875 --> 27:08.502
Okay, come on, boy.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.883
Walk on. That's it.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.057
Walk on!

27:15.676 --> 27:17.019
Walk on, Joey.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.435
Come on, boy, walk on!

27:20.806 --> 27:24.982
You'd be better off standing at the top
of the hill and going down!

27:26.228 --> 27:29.107
Gravity's the only friend
you're gonna have today, young lad!

27:30.440 --> 27:32.613
Walk on, Joey! Walk on!

27:32.985 --> 27:34.828
Come on, Joey, walk on.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.201
Walk on, boy.

27:37.281 --> 27:40.000
Walk on. Come on, walk on.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.464
It'll take the whip to move him.

28:12.316 --> 28:17.038
Bravo! You reached the top of the hill!
Off you go again, boy!

28:17.112 --> 28:19.956
You'll make even better time
coming down!

29:21.593 --> 29:24.517
That's the way. Now, come on,
keep straight, boy. Good boy.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.476
Keep straight. Good lad. Good lad.
Now walk on. Good boy.

29:28.558 --> 29:31.186
Good boy. Now come on, dig in!

29:32.938 --> 29:35.191
Albie, we're all with you!

29:35.607 --> 29:38.451
Come on, keep it straight, boy.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.996
That's it, walk on. Walk on.

29:41.071 --> 29:43.915
- Look, look, the plow hasn't even cut yet.

29:49.997 --> 29:53.171
Do you know,
I believe we can do it, Joey.

29:53.709 --> 29:56.303
I knew when I first saw you
that you'd be the best of us.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.055
That's why he bought you.

29:59.131 --> 30:02.101
He knows you have all the courage
he never had.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.433
I knew when I first saw you
that you'd be the one who'd save us!

30:13.770 --> 30:14.817
Whoa.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.992
You've got no chance, lad.

30:19.443 --> 30:22.413
He'll not turn over half an acre.
Give it up now.

30:22.487 --> 30:27.414
You've done well. You've tried hard.
You're more of a man than your father.

30:27.868 --> 30:31.543
Come on now, Mr. Lyons,
that's a bit rough, isn't it'?

30:31.621 --> 30:33.965
Well, he'll destroy that horse.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.346
I'll be over Thursday.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.603
Give you a day to close it up.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.195
Your wool.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.944
I'm sorry, Rosie.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.093
Now, boy!

31:18.502 --> 31:20.300
You've got to do it, Joey!

31:20.379 --> 31:23.098
You don't know, so I'm going to
have to do the knowing for you.

31:23.173 --> 31:25.767
The rest of our lives depend on this!

31:25.842 --> 31:30.188
So get set to pull! And pull straight!
And pull hard!

31:33.183 --> 31:35.185
Now, boy! Go!

31:35.268 --> 31:38.397
Walk on, Joey, walk on! Whoa! That's it!

31:38.980 --> 31:41.654
Good boy, Joey! Good boy!

31:48.490 --> 31:53.291
Walk on! Walk on! Walk on!
Walk on, Joey!

31:53.370 --> 31:57.841
Go on, walk on! That's it.
Walk on. Walk on.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.429
Go around it!

32:11.930 --> 32:13.227
Whoa, Joey!

32:13.306 --> 32:15.650
Whoa. Joey! Joey!

32:16.560 --> 32:18.278
Joey! Whoa! Whoa!

32:18.353 --> 32:20.355
Joey, stop, you'll break the blade!

32:26.611 --> 32:28.864
Will you look at you!

32:31.032 --> 32:33.000
Mum, Dad! Come and look!

32:33.076 --> 32:34.419
He's doing it!

32:51.219 --> 32:53.062
Good lad, Albie!

32:55.640 --> 32:57.313
Albert, well done!

32:58.727 --> 33:00.900
I wouldn't have believed it!

33:00.979 --> 33:04.404
I'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud
alongside a plow blade.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.700
He could lose a foot.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.527
You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr. Lyons,

33:07.611 --> 33:10.660
if you carry on prating at me
how to manage my son!

33:10.739 --> 33:14.915
Or my plow, or my horse, or my field,
or my farm!

33:22.417 --> 33:25.261
Come on, Albie! Push on through!

33:57.536 --> 34:01.507
Get it done, Albie! Get it done.

34:21.184 --> 34:24.108
Albie, are you all right?

34:24.187 --> 34:25.530
Are you all right?

34:29.192 --> 34:30.364
Up you get.

34:30.443 --> 34:33.538
My pair of fools. My mighty fools.

34:56.052 --> 34:58.396
You're as battered
and bloodied as he is.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.268
- Where's Dad?
- Still in the bottom field.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.694
Stumbling about, I suppose.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.771
It's not the drink, Albert,
that makes him stumble.

35:06.855 --> 35:07.902
He drinks, Mum!

35:07.981 --> 35:11.485
So might you if you'd been
where he's been, seen what he's seen.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.990
He don't talk to me about it.

35:13.069 --> 35:17.324
He don't talk about it 'cause he can't.
There aren't words for some things.

35:18.241 --> 35:19.584
Come here.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.265
The mice have been at it.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.142
Sit down.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.600
Here.

35:44.351 --> 35:46.695
It's his campaign pennant.

35:46.770 --> 35:50.445
He were Sergeant, 7th Battalion,
Imperial Yeomanry.

35:51.941 --> 35:55.536
And that is
the Queen's South Africa Medal.

35:55.612 --> 35:59.082
Every man who fought in the Boer War
got one of those.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.750
And this...

36:01.951 --> 36:04.204
That's the
Distinguished Conduct Medal.

36:04.287 --> 36:07.461
- Not Dad's?
- Well, it isn't mine, dear.

36:08.792 --> 36:11.215
He got that
after the fighting at Transvaal.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.717
After he'd been hurt
and he'd saved some other lads,

36:13.797 --> 36:14.969
and, well, I don't know what else.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.050
He won't tell me, either.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.386
But the first day he got home
he just tossed them out.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.563
First day he could walk,
he threw them straight in the dustbin

36:21.638 --> 36:24.437
and wouldn't hear a word I said not to.

36:26.226 --> 36:30.231
See, what you done today,
you and Joey, you're chuffed up now,

36:30.313 --> 36:33.567
and so you should be, my splendid boy.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.574
It's good to be proud
when you've done something good.

36:36.653 --> 36:40.954
But what he done in Africa,
whatever it was, he takes no pride in it.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.832
Hard as it surely was
and however much pain it's cost him,

36:45.328 --> 36:48.002
he refuses to be proud of killing,
I suppose.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.172
I'd be proud.

36:51.668 --> 36:54.262
If I'd gone off to war,
if I'd gone and saved my mates...

36:54.337 --> 36:56.510
Whether or not you think
you'd do the same thing as him,

36:56.589 --> 36:59.684
think how brave he is
for refusing to be proud.

37:03.763 --> 37:05.015
Your dad makes mistakes,

37:05.098 --> 37:07.942
and he drinks to forget
the mistakes that he's made,

37:09.185 --> 37:11.358
but he never gave up.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.611
And he does that for us.

37:14.774 --> 37:18.529
And today, you showed the world
it's all been worth it.

37:20.029 --> 37:23.533
You keep looking after Joey,
and he'll always be looking after you.

37:27.871 --> 37:31.045
"Sergeant, 7th Battalion,
Imperial Yeomanry."

37:33.710 --> 37:35.212
You see this, Joey?

37:36.045 --> 37:38.423
It's been through an entire war.

37:43.136 --> 37:44.979
I'm not stealing it.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.984
I'll give it back to him someday.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.147
Um...

38:32.268 --> 38:35.397
I'm the only boy that drives in
the village. No one else drives but me.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.733
That's right, and this is my dad's car.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.238
- You're lucky that you're in it.
- Your dad's car.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.992
I'm not normally allowed to drive it
'cause it's so...

38:46.115 --> 38:47.367
Is he a friend of yours?

39:03.967 --> 39:07.312
Come on, boy.
Let's show her how to fly!

39:16.688 --> 39:19.282
- Ahhh!
- Oh!

39:34.414 --> 39:38.009
Well, you're clearly not going to be
a jumper.

40:04.193 --> 40:05.490
Shoo, Harold!

40:15.788 --> 40:18.462
We can try planting something else.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.003
Or we could hire ourselves out
to Uncle Bob.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.603
How else are
we gonna pay Mr. Lyons' rent?

40:44.484 --> 40:46.578
What are we going to do?

40:50.740 --> 40:54.620
I used to believe that God

40:55.328 --> 40:58.332
gave each man
his fair portion of bad luck.

40:59.916 --> 41:03.887
I don't feel that any more.
I've had more than my share.

41:06.673 --> 41:10.519
You'll stop loving me, Rose,
and I won't blame you when you do.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.056
Well, I might hate you more,

41:15.890 --> 41:18.313
but I'll never love you less.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.578
It's War!

41:32.907 --> 41:35.911
We are at war with Germany!

41:35.994 --> 41:41.000
You hear?
England is at war with Germany!

41:43.584 --> 41:47.259
They're going to ring the bells at 6:00,

41:47.922 --> 41:52.268
and then never ring them again
until the war is over.

42:00.435 --> 42:03.780
Look smart, Joey lad!
It's the Tavistock Fair!

42:18.077 --> 42:19.750
What has he done with him?

42:34.802 --> 42:37.646
First name, middle name, last. Sign.

42:37.972 --> 42:41.146
Last name first.
First name, middle name, last.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.983
Take my word for it,
finest horse in the parish.

42:45.104 --> 42:48.324
Goes like a racer,
strong, decent, very fine.

42:48.441 --> 42:53.572
No curbs, no splints. Good feet and teeth.
He's <i>as</i> sound as a bell, sir.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.911
And how much are you charging, sir,

42:55.990 --> 42:59.995
for this strong, decent,
and very fine animal?

43:00.453 --> 43:01.670
Forty.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.591
I'll give you 20 and not a penny more.

43:05.666 --> 43:09.671
Twenty's no good to me, Captain.
Thirty-five and he's yours.

43:09.796 --> 43:12.094
I don't even know how he rides.

43:12.173 --> 43:15.017
Oh, he rides. Splendidly.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.020
You'll be astonished, I promise you that.

43:18.846 --> 43:20.974
Finest horse in all of Devon.

43:22.016 --> 43:24.189
Finest horse I've ever seen.

43:30.817 --> 43:32.160
Thank you.

43:40.701 --> 43:42.044
You can't.

43:43.204 --> 43:45.377
You can't. He's mine.

43:45.498 --> 43:47.125
- I trained him.
- Albert.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.960
You can't have him. He's my horse, sir.

43:49.043 --> 43:52.013
I'm afraid it's too late, lad.
I've just paid 30 guineas for him.

43:52.713 --> 43:55.216
Please. I'll get you money.

43:56.717 --> 44:00.221
I will, I'll get you money.
I'll work for it.

44:00.888 --> 44:02.231
I'll work for it.

44:07.061 --> 44:08.904
He won't obey anyone else.

44:09.689 --> 44:12.909
He won't be any good in the war neither.
He shies at every sound.

44:14.402 --> 44:15.745
I'm sorry.

44:17.405 --> 44:19.908
Well, if Joey's going, I'm going, too.
I'm volunteering.

44:20.741 --> 44:23.085
- I see. What's your name, lad?
- Albert, sir.

44:23.202 --> 44:24.875
- And how old are you, Albert?
- Nineteen, sir.

44:26.080 --> 44:29.254
- Is that the truth?
- No, sir, but I look 19

44:29.333 --> 44:30.425
and I'm bigger than most 19-year-olds,

44:30.501 --> 44:32.674
and I'm strong, sir,
and I'm not afraid of anything.

44:32.753 --> 44:35.097
I don't doubt your qualifications, Albert,

44:35.173 --> 44:38.848
but the law is very clear
about the proper age for soldiering.

44:38.926 --> 44:42.271
Your father's done what he had to do,
you know that.

44:43.431 --> 44:46.355
Thirty guineas isn't nearly enough
to purchase a horse

44:46.434 --> 44:49.278
as fine as your Joey, I know that.

44:49.395 --> 44:51.068
But it's all I've got.

44:52.273 --> 44:56.278
Will you lease him to me, Albert?
To be my own mount?

44:59.947 --> 45:03.042
I promise you, man to man,
that I'll look after him

45:03.117 --> 45:05.540
as closely as you've done.

45:05.620 --> 45:09.796
I'll respect him and all the care
that you've taken with him.

45:10.625 --> 45:15.131
And if I can, I'll return him to your care.

45:21.302 --> 45:22.645
Now say goodbye.

45:26.557 --> 45:27.649
It's all right.

45:27.725 --> 45:31.730
All right, turn it in. That's enough.
He's a horse, not a dog.

45:31.812 --> 45:34.065
Now on your way. Come on!

45:40.821 --> 45:43.995
Do you want to lose the farm? Rose?

45:46.160 --> 45:48.003
It's the way you did it.

45:50.331 --> 45:52.174
But we're at war.

45:54.502 --> 45:56.175
Aren't we just?

46:32.206 --> 46:33.378
Joey.

46:33.499 --> 46:35.046
I told you, sling your hook!

46:35.167 --> 46:37.169
Let him be, Perkins.

46:39.046 --> 46:42.050
This isn't the end.
This isn't the end, my brother.

46:42.174 --> 46:45.553
I, Albert Narracott, solemnly swear
we will be together again.

46:45.636 --> 46:49.891
Wherever you are, I will find you,
and I will bring you home.

47:07.908 --> 47:10.582
Steady, steady. Steady now, come on!

47:11.412 --> 47:15.258
Walk on! Walk on, come on! Get on!

47:29.930 --> 47:32.774
- Take good care of him.
- Yes, sir. I will.

47:56.290 --> 47:58.463
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy. Easy.

48:01.462 --> 48:02.634
Easy.

48:11.097 --> 48:12.974
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

48:14.141 --> 48:17.486
Steady, steady. Whoa, whoa, Joey!

48:17.561 --> 48:21.236
Stop mucking about, you hear?
You're in the army now, son.

48:21.982 --> 48:24.986
Good boy. Good boy. Steady.

48:25.820 --> 48:28.664
Steady, steady. Come on.
Easy, come on.

48:28.989 --> 48:31.162
Come on, around. Good boy.

48:32.493 --> 48:33.836
Relax.

48:35.121 --> 48:36.964
Easy, easy, back up!

48:39.500 --> 48:41.423
Joey, meet Topthorn.

48:41.502 --> 48:43.504
Topthorn, this is Joey.

48:43.629 --> 48:46.348
Sort out who's in charge
between the two of you. Do you hear?

48:46.465 --> 48:50.015
If you want to fight, get it over with
'cause once we're over there,

48:50.094 --> 48:52.517
you're going to need
everything you've got for Fritz.

48:52.638 --> 48:56.518
Gently, Perkins.
I don't want to sour him.

48:56.642 --> 48:59.020
There'll be nothing gentle
about the war, sir.

48:59.103 --> 49:01.197
And there'll be nothing gentle
about this one, either.

49:01.313 --> 49:04.317
I understand that, Sergeant,
but I want him fit and shining.

49:04.817 --> 49:06.285
He's my horse.

49:06.360 --> 49:07.532
Sir.

49:09.029 --> 49:10.372
Easy, boy.

49:11.699 --> 49:14.122
Scares the living daylights out of me.

49:14.201 --> 49:17.876
- Who?
- Perkins. Glad he's on our side.

49:17.997 --> 49:20.671
Not bad. Not bad at all.

49:21.709 --> 49:24.883
Still, not a patch on my Topthorn.

49:25.504 --> 49:28.724
I wouldn't be so sure.
I think he's got potential.

49:28.841 --> 49:31.640
He's certainly got the bit
between his teeth.

49:31.719 --> 49:34.723
I actually think my Blenheim's faster
than the pair of them.

49:35.389 --> 49:36.732
Clear off.

49:40.561 --> 49:42.234
All right, gentlemen, listen here.

49:42.855 --> 49:45.984
Everything tells us the same story,
from Waterloo to Omdurman,

49:46.066 --> 49:48.660
from Pickett's Charge
to the Battle of Mars-la-Tour.

49:48.736 --> 49:51.990
The first attack can and should be
the decisive one. Perkins?

49:52.072 --> 49:53.745
- Yes, sir.
- No excuses, no mistakes.

49:53.866 --> 49:55.994
Every horse groomed
and fit for presentation.

49:56.076 --> 49:58.579
- I want a full practice charge tomorrow.
- Sir.

50:08.047 --> 50:09.765
I thought you two had bottled out.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.183
As if.

50:14.929 --> 50:17.853
All right, then. Let's see what
you two jokers are made of, shall we?

50:17.932 --> 50:19.855
This is what quiet confidence looks like.

50:19.934 --> 50:21.436
I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.

50:24.271 --> 50:25.944
Over to you, Captain Nicholls.

50:29.860 --> 50:32.283
Draw swords!

50:34.448 --> 50:36.576
Give point!

50:39.036 --> 50:40.629
Charge!

50:59.223 --> 51:03.569
Come on, Joey, I know you've got it.
Come on, boy!

51:18.576 --> 51:19.748
Come on, boy!

51:30.337 --> 51:33.341
- Whoa! Whoa!

51:38.429 --> 51:39.851
Nice of you to turn up.

51:39.930 --> 51:43.355
He's got speed, I'll give him that.
But has he got stamina?

51:43.434 --> 51:45.107
He has everything.

52:03.287 --> 52:04.630
What are you up to?

52:05.122 --> 52:06.624
I'm writing a letter.

52:07.291 --> 52:08.964
With a picture in it?

52:10.961 --> 52:13.384
It's to the boy who owned Joey.

52:13.464 --> 52:16.217
I want to show him
how wonderful he's looking.

52:16.300 --> 52:19.804
Before we take him across the Channel
to face a million German guns.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.222
Yes, before that.

52:22.556 --> 52:24.149
4:00 a.m. start tomorrow,

52:24.224 --> 52:27.603
traveling with the Dragoon Guards
and the Royals. Transport detachment.

52:27.686 --> 52:29.734
They need to be at the dock
at 5:00 a.m. to check all the kit.

52:29.813 --> 52:32.066
Battle orders, no polishing.

52:32.149 --> 52:36.404
Buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup irons,
let them all go dull.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.285
I don't want anything to flash in the sun
and give us away.

52:38.364 --> 52:39.741
Of course.

52:40.824 --> 52:42.497
- Charlie.
- Jamie.

52:43.327 --> 52:44.624
Charlie.

52:48.999 --> 52:51.593
What do you think of the new cap?

52:54.254 --> 52:56.928
Silk lining. I quite like it.

52:57.341 --> 53:00.015
I'm not sure it's going to make
a lot of difference to the Germans.

53:00.094 --> 53:02.768
Oh, I don't know about that.
Think about it.

53:02.846 --> 53:06.350
You're a Boche, just working out
which of two chaps to shoot,

53:06.433 --> 53:08.185
and you thought, "Good Lord",

53:08.268 --> 53:11.112
one of them really is wearing
a very stylish cap indeed!."

53:11.188 --> 53:12.610
You might shoot the other one instead.

53:13.524 --> 53:18.530
Or alternatively think, "I fancy that cap,"
and kill you first of all.

53:22.491 --> 53:23.538
Hadn't thought of that.

53:53.063 --> 53:55.157
That is our target,
the German 11th Division,

53:55.274 --> 53:58.244
at the moment bivouacked three miles
to the east of the Menin Road.

53:58.318 --> 53:59.410
We have been watching them,

53:59.486 --> 54:01.989
and they have pitched tents
for the night and lit cooking fires.

54:02.114 --> 54:05.084
Knock them out and we could slide in
behind the German lines

54:05.159 --> 54:07.002
and come at them from the south
at Geluveld.

54:07.077 --> 54:08.169
Excellent.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.748
- Numbers?
- About 600, infantry.

54:10.831 --> 54:11.923
Twice our size.

54:11.999 --> 54:13.922
Regiments of horse and men,
the advantage is ours.

54:14.001 --> 54:16.675
And we have surprise on our side.
But the sooner we move, the better.

54:16.795 --> 54:18.843
We have no assurance
they'll still be there tomorrow morning.

54:18.964 --> 54:21.262
Right. Good.

54:21.341 --> 54:23.594
So today it is. Charlie, tell the men.

54:23.677 --> 54:25.600
- Salisbury formation?
- Salisbury formation.

54:25.679 --> 54:27.602
Charge through them
and secure the ground behind.

54:27.681 --> 54:30.355
The grass to the left is taller
than we are, it's perfect cover.

54:30.434 --> 54:31.686
Excellent work, Sergeant Major.

54:31.810 --> 54:34.359
Time spent
on reconnaissance is rarely wasted.

54:34.438 --> 54:35.781
Thank you, Singh.

54:36.607 --> 54:37.779
Jamie!

54:40.027 --> 54:41.870
They have no idea we're coming.

54:41.945 --> 54:44.118
Not having scruples, are you, Jim?

54:44.782 --> 54:47.956
No, I understand
the surprise is everything.

54:49.453 --> 54:51.797
But if it must be done,
let's do it quickly.

54:58.045 --> 54:59.388
You all right, Charlie?

55:01.965 --> 55:03.308
Never been better.

55:03.967 --> 55:06.641
Literally. Never better.

55:09.807 --> 55:12.651
Prepare to mount! Mount!

55:14.478 --> 55:16.151
Prepare to mount!

55:16.814 --> 55:18.066
Mount!

55:18.148 --> 55:19.650
Thank you, Stanley.

55:23.487 --> 55:24.909
Hey, Joey.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.491
MY bonny boy.

55:33.747 --> 55:35.749
You're all right, aren't you, Joey?

55:37.543 --> 55:38.590
Eh?

56:03.360 --> 56:07.536
Gentlemen, it is an honor
to ride beside you.

56:08.532 --> 56:12.537
Make the Kaiser rue the day
he dared to cross swords with us.

56:13.704 --> 56:17.880
Let every man make himself,
his King, his country,

56:18.208 --> 56:20.711
and his fallen comrades proud.

56:22.045 --> 56:23.388
Be brave.

56:24.214 --> 56:27.058
Fear God! Honor the King!

56:27.384 --> 56:29.887
Fear God! Honor the King!

56:45.235 --> 56:47.909
Draw swords!

56:50.073 --> 56:52.121
Good luck, my friends.

56:58.415 --> 56:59.917
Forward, to walk!

57:00.918 --> 57:03.592
Walk, march!

57:12.262 --> 57:14.264
Forward, to canter!

57:17.100 --> 57:19.944
Canter, march!

57:47.881 --> 57:49.224
<i>Kavallerie!</i>

57:57.641 --> 57:59.314
Charge!

58:40.100 --> 58:41.443
Burn the documents!

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.612
Pull him down!

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:41.639
What? Did you think that a garrison
on open ground would go undefended?

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.145
Look at yourself!

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.477
Who do you think you are?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.753
- Now come!

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.814
- What do we do with the horses?
- If they're injured, shoot them.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:11.061
And the others, sir?

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:13.647
The others you round up and take
to base camp. They will pull guns.

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:16.400
You'll never get fancy horses like these
to pull guns.

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:17.985
- Then shoot them also!
- Sir?

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.241
Perhaps we could use some of them
with the ambulances,

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.994
to get the injured men off the field.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.077
- Will they take the harness?
- I'd like to try, sir.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:34.008
It won't work. They're cavalry.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:35.752
- Let's try.
- You won't get the harness on.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:38.839
Come on, Michael. Whoa. Whoa.

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:42.767
Easy now.
Easy now, Englishman. Easy.

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.970
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:48.311
Easy. Easy. Easy.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.687
Easy now.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:50.855
Whoa.

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:52.023
Gunther.

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:55.522
It's hopeless. We can't help them.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.808
Well, well, look at you.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:27.475
Whoever taught you this
has just saved your life.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.601
Hello, the farm!

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:12.770
Hello, Si Easton.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.443
I was at the post office.

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:20.741
And while I was there, Mrs. Allen said
a parcel had come for Albert from the...

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.360
From the...

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:25.536
From over there. And I thought

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:29.116
I could go up that way in the morning,
and here it is.

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:33.037
Who'd be sending me a parcel
over there?

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.962
Well, open it and see.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.473
It's a sketchbook.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.306
It's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook!

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.901
See that? That's a picture of Joey!

01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:57.818
It's a picture of Joey.

01:04:58.478 --> 01:04:59.900
Well, I never!

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:01.481
And there's a letter.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:03.821
Well, go on then, go on.

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:08.322
"Dear Albert Narracott,
Captain Nicholls, who died..."

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.825
"Captain Nicholls, who died in action
today, left you this."

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:13.668
"Yours, Sergeant Sam Perkins."

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:16.588
You weren't to know it was bad news.

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:18.665
He was riding Joey when he died.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:22.837
- You don't know that he was riding him.
- "In action," it says.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.649
Gentlemen!

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:23.071
We move forward
to the front line tonight.

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:26.566
Full marching orders.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.236
Get moving!

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:31.491
Schroeder!

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:34.415
No, not you. You. Come.

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.077
I'm keeping you here.

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:39.921
You're best with the horses,
and we need to move the camp quickly

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:42.666
if the enemy continues
to push through from the west.

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:45.172
- They're pushing through?
- I'm told.

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:48.095
We will move later, when we find
where the horses are needed most.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.924
Yes, sir. Perhaps I can keep
my brother here with me.

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:52.801
He's also very good with horses.

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:55.645
No. Not necessary.
Get moving, we leave tonight.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:05.776
It's all right, Gunther.

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:12.700
You are not going.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:16.409
I'll tell them you're only 14.
That you're a boy.

01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:19.836
Father signed me in. He knew my age.
And so do they.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.251
Mother obviously never told you
how to fold a shirt.

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:28.428
Of course she did. I just wasn't listening.

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:31.302
But you need to listen now.
I promised her.

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:35.890
I made her a solemn promise
that you would be safe with me.

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.642
With me, Michael.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:43.935
They'll never make a head count.

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:47.192
There are too many of us.
You can stay here.

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:49.691
Slip underneath the bed,
until they move out.

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:51.159
Then what?

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:55.830
Gunther, it will be fine.

01:07:56.489 --> 01:08:00.665
And when all the machines break down
and they call up the horses,

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:03.671
I'll see you at the front.

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:06.879
We'll be together again.

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:10.511
Gunther.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:29.022
I'm giving this to you.
For luck.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:39.372
To keep you safe.

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:48.609
Ah!

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:59.787
Get back in line!

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:34.405
I'm hungry. Did you bring food?

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.823
I'm sorry.

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:44.658
- Will Father be ashamed?
- He will pretend to be.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.493
Maybe at first he will be.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:52.047
But in the end, he will be glad.

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:54.842
And us?

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.671
What about us?

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:08.014
I was ready to go.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.852
I was proud to go.

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:17.573
I wanted to go.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.919
The food in Italy is good.

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:31.333
Yes.

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:34.669
And what about the women?

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.924
Not <i>as</i> good as the food.

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:43.383
Because they've eaten
too much of the food?

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:48.813
You are too young for war
and you're too young for women!

01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:50.561
I don't feel so young.

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:54.609
- Not any more.
- Michael.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:56.775
- What?
- Go to sleep.

01:11:57.855 --> 01:12:00.404
We have a big night of riding ahead.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:04.070
Good night, Michael.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:11.953
Night-night, Gunther.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.472
- Schroeder.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:16.309
A mistake?

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:21.489
A promise.

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:24.192
<i>Ja.</i>

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:03.165
<i>Grand-père.</i>

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:10.673
It's closer today.

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:14.431
The wind plays tricks with the noise.
It's moving away from us.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.762
I can hear it, grand-père.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:18.772
And there is no wind.

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:21.355
You shouldn't lie to me.

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:23.778
Here. There is no wind here.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:28.942
But over there, the wind is so strong
it will lift you off the ground.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:33.280
You lie about everything!

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:37.708
You say you aren't worried,
but it's clear you are.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:40.378
I know the war is approaching,

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:44.048
but you say,
"Oh, it's just a trick of the wind."

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:45.545
Did I say that?

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:48.465
You started lying
when Mama and Papa went away.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:52.640
They're dead.

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:54.805
But you won't say so.

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:57.395
Do you think I'll die
if you tell me the truth?

01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:59.143
The truth is

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:04.143
you should speak to your elders
with respect.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:14.571
If you tell me the truth about the war,

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:18.992
I will tell you the truth
about the big horses

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:21.831
I've been keeping in the windmill.

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:26.462
Now who is the one telling lies?

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:29.088
In the windmill?

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:33.344
Yes. They were standing in the windmill
waiting for Don Quixote.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.014
This is François and this is Claude.

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:40.600
I named them after two boys
who broke my heart last summer.

01:16:40.679 --> 01:16:42.681
They must belong to someone.

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:45.609
Horses like this don't just appear
from a fairy tale.

01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:48.938
Yes, I know, grand-pére.
They are not unicorns.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:52.946
- Now, Emilie...
- So I will be fair and wait one day,

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:55.778
and if no one comes to get them
by night-time,

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.455
then they belong to me.

01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:00.704
Emilie, look at me.

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:04.207
You cannot ride.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.789
Mother used to tell me
how my bones would give way

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:11.469
- with the slightest bump or fall.
- Yes. That's right. So, it is settled?

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:14.964
Good girl.

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:20.640
It will only be settled
when I decide which one to ride first.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:25.149
Over my dead body!

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:27.226
At least I won't have long to wait!

01:17:47.746 --> 01:17:51.341
I was in love with a boy called François,
who had your lovely eyes.

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:55.843
Unfortunately, he was in love with a girl
called Marie, who had your teeth.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:59.016
She fell for a boy called Claude,
who broke my heart

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:00.718
and who I intend to marry one day.

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:07.566
Eyes on me.

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:09.777
No talking.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:12.947
Today, we learn to jump.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:17.194
Did you know the French cleared
the 1.85 meter at the Paris Olympics

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:20.780
to win the gold medal?
Today, we will beat that record.

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:26.043
This is your jump.

01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:29.292
When I call you,
be very brave and leap over it!

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.380
Leap over it!

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:34.460
Watch me.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:40.966
And now it's your...

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:24.848
He doesn't think we can do it.
But we will show him, won't we?

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:40.859
No need to be afraid.

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:46.206
You are very tall.

01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:50.710
You'll kill yourself.

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:53.214
Only if you get in my way
to make me fall.

01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:55.716
Oh, please. Come off the...

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:09.806
Find somewhere to hide them.

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:11.561
And do it quickly.

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:53.353
My name is Bonnard. This is my land.
Why are you here?

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:58.108
Food. For the soldiers at the front.
Everyone must give their share.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:23.800
They are taking everything.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.973
Where are the horses?

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:29.885
What horses?

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.075
- What is it?
- Leave it if you don't know what it's for.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:47.824
A pot is a pot. We'll find some use for it.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:50.073
Sir.

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:54.748
- Where's the livestock?
- I make jam. We have no animals.

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:57.080
But there's fresh hay in your barn.

01:21:57.162 --> 01:22:00.666
We use it
to replace the mattress stuffings.

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:08.511
- Her grandfather?
- Yes.

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:11.515
- Where are her parents?
- They're dead.

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:13.687
They died.

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:17.273
What is that?

01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:20.853
The wind. It plays tricks in the attic.

01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:23.360
There is no wind.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:25.862
An old house creaks.

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:28.364
Go, close the shutters.

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:37.628
She's sickly, no?

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:42.379
If you or any of your friends harm her,

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:47.046
as old as I am, I will kill you.

01:22:56.221 --> 01:23:00.146
You know,
I was going to give you back your pot.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:02.227
But now I'm going to keep it.

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:06.073
For soup.

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:09.158
We will be back.

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:12.075
In the new season.

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:39.598
Tell me what happened to them.

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:42.935
To my mother and father.

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:47.273
You said you would tell me
how they died

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:50.359
on my birthday.

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:53.116
And tomorrow's my birthday.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.453
They died fighting.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:00.286
Didn't they?

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:02.792
But when the soldiers come,

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:06.300
you do nothing.

01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:09.966
- You are a coward, aren't you?
- Yes.

01:24:10.087 --> 01:24:13.136
It was your parents who were brave.

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:15.475
I make jams.

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:20.981
And you've never done a brave thing
in your life?

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:29.815
Maybe there are different ways
to be brave.

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:37.031
Did you know the French
have the best carrier pigeons?

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:40.785
And this could be the difference
in the war,

01:24:40.867 --> 01:24:43.495
our messages getting through.

01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:46.836
I don't want to hear about the birds.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:55.012
They are released at the front
and told to go home.

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:57.509
This is all they know.

01:24:58.677 --> 01:25:03.683
But to get there,
they must fly over a war.

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:07.190
Can you imagine such a thing?

01:25:08.895 --> 01:25:11.569
Here you are flying over

01:25:12.024 --> 01:25:17.372
so much pain and terror,
and you know you can never look down.

01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:21.208
You have to look forward,
or you'll never get home.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.881
I ask you,
what could be braver than that?

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:05.369
- What is that?
- A present.

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:09.460
I hope you have not bought me
a disgusting dress

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:11.458
that I then have to wear, like last year.

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:13.005
It was disgusting?

01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:14.177
- Yes.

01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:15.970
I looked like an ugly nun.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.473
Give me your hand.

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:27.106
Grand-pére, we have no money!

01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:31.904
When the war is over, then you can
buy me jewels and carriages.

01:26:31.978 --> 01:26:35.699
Anything you say, my sweet one.
Anything you say.

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:38.277
You are, of course, the boss.

01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:40.530
It's just an old thing I found.

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:43.912
Don't worry yourself. Leave it.
I'll put it back.

01:27:10.434 --> 01:27:12.152
It was your mother's.

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:15.655
I hid it so <i>as</i> not to encourage you.

01:27:16.982 --> 01:27:21.237
Emilie, I want you to ride very slowly.
Very carefully.

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:23.663
- And promise me you won't go far.
- Of course.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:26.329
To the top of the hill
and straight back again.

01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:27.997
I promise.

01:27:28.118 --> 01:27:29.461
MY hero!

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.303
Slowly. Slowly.

01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:52.813
Emilie!

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:56.021
Emilie!

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.059
- Let go of me! No!
- She is my granddaughter!

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:37.025
- François!
- Emilie, stop! Don't hurt her, please!

01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:39.572
- Don't hurt her.
- No!

01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:47.076
You don't need them.
There are so many others!

01:28:47.197 --> 01:28:50.667
Please, take the bigger one
and leave the smaller one.

01:28:51.243 --> 01:28:54.042
You are breaking
my granddaughter's heart.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:59.085
The war has taken everything
from everyone.

01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:05.341
- What will happen to them'?
- They will pull artillery until they die.

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:07.425
Or until the war is over.

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:10.433
It will never be over!

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:13.436
You have your answer then.

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:53.396
Heiglemann.

01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:55.473
- These are yours.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:55.599 --> 01:29:58.978
They look strong.
Should last a month or two.

01:30:05.317 --> 01:30:06.990
You're beautiful.

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:18.626
It's a pity they found you.

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:22.797
Such a pity.

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:35.647
Pull together, men!
Pull together!

01:30:36.473 --> 01:30:40.478
Together, men! Together!
Put your backs into it!

01:30:46.316 --> 01:30:48.614
Steady pace! Steady pace!

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:51.822
- Watch out, number three's slacking!
- Move it, move it!

01:30:56.493 --> 01:30:59.212
Halt! Halt! Break!

01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:02.173
Break! Stop! Stop!

01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:22.144
Heiglemann! Bring out another one!

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:25.026
Heiglemann, bring up another horse!

01:31:25.647 --> 01:31:26.739
That one!

01:31:32.696 --> 01:31:35.745
No, no! The big black one!

01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:56.099
He's a good horse, sir.

01:31:56.219 --> 01:31:59.769
But if you move him up to
the heavy gun, he will be no use at all.

01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:02.688
Prince is already losing condition.
His leg, sir.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:05.020
- You have given them names?
- Yes, sir.

01:32:05.103 --> 01:32:08.027
You should never give a name
to anything you are certain to lose.

01:32:08.106 --> 01:32:10.108
But his leg is not good enough, sir.

01:32:10.233 --> 01:32:13.453
Private, you will do
<i>as</i> you are told.

01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:14.867
Hook him up!

01:32:24.789 --> 01:32:27.463
Can't you see, sir? This one is stronger.

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:29.219
Hook him up!

01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:07.124
No slacking!

01:33:07.457 --> 01:33:09.960
Keep it taut! Use your whip!

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:57.052
No slacking! To the top!

01:34:03.847 --> 01:34:05.520
Halt!

01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:08.693
Take the horses away.

01:34:17.527 --> 01:34:19.029
Shell!

01:34:27.704 --> 01:34:29.377
And load!

01:34:34.711 --> 01:34:36.054
Back!

01:34:37.046 --> 01:34:38.263
Case!

01:34:43.386 --> 01:34:44.729
Position!

01:34:50.935 --> 01:34:52.357
OFFICER 22 And

01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:54.401
fire!

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:37.070
Valuables in the bucket, lads!
If you live, you'll get them back!

01:35:37.899 --> 01:35:40.573
If you live, you get them back.
Good luck!

01:35:40.777 --> 01:35:42.654
Valuables in the bucket!

01:35:55.291 --> 01:35:58.465
The blood of Christ
keep thee in eternal life.

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.047
In the name of the Father
and of the Son...

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:05.101
Maybe it's a drill, Albie.
Maybe it's a drill, like last time.

01:36:09.055 --> 01:36:10.398
Love letter?

01:36:13.893 --> 01:36:15.566
Well, that's my business.

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:21.735
I hear you and your mate
were doing bird imitations again.

01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:25.409
Are you going to write a letter
to your horse?

01:36:25.738 --> 01:36:27.240
After you find your horse,

01:36:27.323 --> 01:36:30.748
I've lost my needle in a haystack
and I could use some help.

01:36:31.661 --> 01:36:33.208
Anything valuable!

01:36:33.288 --> 01:36:36.838
Anyone who comes back
gets to share it out!

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.002
Stay here.

01:36:41.671 --> 01:36:44.766
Remember that day me and Joey
raced you in your car?

01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:47.094
I remember you somersaulting
through the air.

01:36:47.176 --> 01:36:49.019
Who was that girl you were with?

01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:51.097
There was a girl?

01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:54.184
There was. Don't you remember?

01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:57.862
It was just some girl, I suppose.
I don't recall which one.

01:36:58.688 --> 01:37:01.692
I do remember you
falling on your bum in a ditch.

01:37:02.025 --> 01:37:03.197
You see?

01:37:03.609 --> 01:37:07.113
Always entertaining, Narracott.
I'll give you that.

01:37:08.114 --> 01:37:11.038
You did that? You fell on your bum?

01:37:20.793 --> 01:37:23.797
Into position! Everyone ready!

01:37:24.630 --> 01:37:28.305
- There she goes!
- Into position! Let's go!

01:37:29.052 --> 01:37:31.054
- Go! Choke on it!
- Yes, Sarge!

01:37:31.137 --> 01:37:34.232
Be brave, boys! Be ready! Be ready!

01:37:34.557 --> 01:37:36.855
Let's go, men, get ready to go!

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:40.735
Hold your nerve, boys!

01:37:40.813 --> 01:37:43.908
Remember, it's not too far to go,
there's a way through!

01:37:43.983 --> 01:37:47.112
Run fast, keep your wits about you,
keep your eyes open,

01:37:47.195 --> 01:37:49.243
and God and the King
will keep an eye on you.

01:37:49.322 --> 01:37:52.997
Company will fix bayonets!
Fix bayonets!

01:37:53.659 --> 01:37:55.502
You know what it reminds me of
out there?

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:57.338
- What?
- That bloody impossible lower field

01:37:57.455 --> 01:37:59.173
the day me and Joey plowed it.

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:02.464
Best day of my life, that was,
and you were there.

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.839
And this here is the worst day of my life
about to begin,

01:38:05.963 --> 01:38:09.467
and you're here cheering me on.
Us two, always!

01:38:10.134 --> 01:38:11.181
And him.

01:38:11.302 --> 01:38:13.350
Once you're in no man's land,
go to the flank,

01:38:13.471 --> 01:38:14.563
- stay on the flank.
- Yes, sir.

01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:17.358
- Come on, boys, to the ladders!
- Stick close to the gentry, yeah?

01:38:17.475 --> 01:38:20.695
That's our ticket. We have the pluck,
but they have the luck.

01:38:20.812 --> 01:38:22.610
Come on, boys, keep going.
Keep going.

01:38:22.688 --> 01:38:23.814
Andrew.

01:38:24.190 --> 01:38:25.863
You, too, Narracott.

01:38:25.983 --> 01:38:27.326
And you, too.

01:38:46.546 --> 01:38:48.389
Come on. On your ladders, boys!
On your ladders.

01:38:48.506 --> 01:38:50.554
In you go! In you go! That's it!

01:38:52.176 --> 01:38:54.053
Listen to your Sergeant!

01:38:54.387 --> 01:38:57.061
If anybody turns back,

01:38:57.181 --> 01:39:00.981
if any one of our boys
comes running towards you,

01:39:01.394 --> 01:39:06.070
you take this rifle
and you shoot them dead!

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:08.534
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

01:39:08.651 --> 01:39:11.700
Do you understand me? Do you
understand what I'm telling you, son?

01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:14.870
You take this rifle
and you shoot them dead.

01:39:15.158 --> 01:39:16.660
You understand?

01:39:19.662 --> 01:39:23.337
Up there, son. Up your ladder!
Up your ladder to your work!

01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:25.589
It's good. Andrew, it's good.

01:39:26.085 --> 01:39:27.257
Andrew!

01:39:27.837 --> 01:39:29.680
Nobody's retreating today.

01:39:30.339 --> 01:39:34.094
Andrew! Andrew,
nobody is retreating today!

01:39:46.355 --> 01:39:49.029
Ready to go over the top!

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:07.103
Just leave me! Leave me!

01:41:21.158 --> 01:41:24.708
You'll be all right here. You'll be safe.
Someone will come for you.

01:41:25.871 --> 01:41:27.043
Albert.

01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:29.463
- Albert, listen.
- It's all right.

01:41:29.542 --> 01:41:33.046
It's all right. We're Devon boys. Yeah?

01:41:35.631 --> 01:41:36.723
Yeah.

01:42:58.297 --> 01:42:59.799
Get down!

01:44:31.849 --> 01:44:32.975
No!

01:44:37.646 --> 01:44:39.364
Albie.

01:44:51.494 --> 01:44:52.837
We made it.

01:44:53.704 --> 01:44:55.047
We made it.

01:45:08.719 --> 01:45:11.222
Andrew! This way out!

01:45:12.723 --> 01:45:14.725
Gas, gas, gas!

01:45:18.354 --> 01:45:19.606
Albie.

01:45:51.262 --> 01:45:53.856
There's no stopping here.
Keep them moving!

01:45:53.931 --> 01:45:57.686
But, sir, there's something wrong.
This one needs to rest.

01:45:57.768 --> 01:46:01.614
There's no rest for them.
Move them along! Move them along!

01:46:22.626 --> 01:46:26.130
Please, please, please.
Stay on your feet. No, please!

01:46:26.463 --> 01:46:27.555
No, no, no.

01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:31.644
No. Please.

01:46:31.969 --> 01:46:34.313
Please. Stay on your feet.

01:46:34.388 --> 01:46:36.641
Come on, come on. Please.

01:46:36.724 --> 01:46:39.728
No, please. Stay on your feet. Come on.

01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:38.710
They're coming. Leave it, Private!
Leave it!

01:47:39.036 --> 01:47:40.379
Come with me.

01:47:40.788 --> 01:47:42.290
Go to hell!

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:46.342
Run!

01:47:47.127 --> 01:47:49.971
Run! Run!

01:47:50.714 --> 01:47:51.761
Run!

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:53.391
Run!

01:51:07.828 --> 01:51:09.751
<i>Stand to, stand to.</i>

01:51:10.914 --> 01:51:12.757
There's something moving.

01:51:13.167 --> 01:51:15.090
What the hell is it?

01:51:17.671 --> 01:51:19.765
It looks like a cow.

01:51:20.257 --> 01:51:23.431
What the hell would a cow
be doing up there?

01:51:28.265 --> 01:51:30.267
That definitely isn't a cow.

01:51:30.934 --> 01:51:32.106
Well, what is it?

01:51:32.352 --> 01:51:35.356
It can't be a horse.
Nothing alive could be out there.

01:51:35.439 --> 01:51:38.443
It isn't a horse. It isn't a horse!

01:51:41.028 --> 01:51:42.200
Yes, it's a horse.

01:51:44.198 --> 01:51:46.041
- It's a horse.
- Yeah, it's a horse.

01:51:46.283 --> 01:51:48.126
Well, bugger me.

01:51:49.453 --> 01:51:50.955
It's a horse!

01:51:54.958 --> 01:51:57.131
Lads, we should call him.

01:51:58.045 --> 01:51:59.888
How do you call a horse?

01:52:42.005 --> 01:52:44.053
He's caught on the wire.

01:52:48.679 --> 01:52:50.477
Oh, sod it.

01:52:58.146 --> 01:53:00.023
What do you think you're doing?

01:53:00.691 --> 01:53:02.693
Get back, do you hear me?

01:53:02.818 --> 01:53:05.241
Corporal, that's an order. Get back!

01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:09.204
Listen to him, sir. We can't leave him.

01:53:09.992 --> 01:53:11.494
What's he doing?

01:53:11.827 --> 01:53:13.170
It's a trap.

01:53:13.704 --> 01:53:16.457
No, I don't think so.
I think he's trying to help.

01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:18.918
Scare him back into his hole.

01:53:26.174 --> 01:53:28.176
It's a white flag, isn't it?

01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:30.353
You see the white flag?

01:53:31.054 --> 01:53:33.898
I'm just after tending to this here horse
is all!

01:53:37.894 --> 01:53:40.397
Get back, you stupid git!

01:53:41.523 --> 01:53:44.868
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want."

01:53:46.570 --> 01:53:48.914
"He leadeth me into green pastures."

01:53:49.906 --> 01:53:53.581
"He leadeth me down
beside still waters."

01:54:08.592 --> 01:54:10.265
Poor beastie.

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.063
Poor babbie.

01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:17.435
It's all right.
It's all right, don't buck and wriggle so.

01:54:18.894 --> 01:54:20.771
You're only shredding yourself.

01:54:22.606 --> 01:54:24.279
You'll blind yourself.

01:54:27.069 --> 01:54:30.414
Bugger me worthless. I didn't think to
bring gloves or something to cut the...

01:54:30.489 --> 01:54:32.241
- Ow!

01:54:35.410 --> 01:54:37.959
I thought perhaps
you might need these.

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:39.627
For the barbed wire.

01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:43.965
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I...

01:54:44.628 --> 01:54:45.971
Thanks.

01:54:46.588 --> 01:54:47.931
Cheers.

01:54:48.632 --> 01:54:50.134
Cheers.

01:54:50.258 --> 01:54:51.430
Thanks.

01:54:59.935 --> 01:55:02.654
That's a very long strand.

01:55:02.771 --> 01:55:05.650
And when you cut it, it's going to release

01:55:07.234 --> 01:55:10.408
this, and this, and this.

01:55:10.946 --> 01:55:12.664
And they'll coil back rather violently,

01:55:12.739 --> 01:55:14.787
which, I'm afraid, will only wound
the poor fellow further.

01:55:16.451 --> 01:55:18.294
You speak good English.

01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:21.798
I speak English well.

01:55:22.666 --> 01:55:23.838
May I?

01:55:35.345 --> 01:55:37.598
What if we cut his head free first,

01:55:37.681 --> 01:55:40.184
so he won't try to stand up
and blind himself?

01:55:40.308 --> 01:55:42.606
- And then...
- Pity you didn't bring a second pair.

01:55:42.686 --> 01:55:44.529
Then I could cut the wire here.

01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:47.278
We need more wire cutters!

01:55:58.493 --> 01:55:59.836
His blind spot.

01:56:01.037 --> 01:56:02.880
The cutters won't frighten him.

01:56:03.999 --> 01:56:07.299
If you could cut here, holding this wire,

01:56:07.377 --> 01:56:10.551
- I could...
- Say no more. I'm right behind you.

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:13.804
And you understand what's happening,
do you not, O Best Beloved'?

01:56:13.884 --> 01:56:16.558
And you must lay so very nice and still.

01:56:16.678 --> 01:56:18.225
There's a lad.

01:56:18.346 --> 01:56:21.850
A remarkable horse, you are,
helping us help you.

01:56:22.726 --> 01:56:24.319
There's a lad.

01:56:24.394 --> 01:56:26.362
There's a remarkable lad.

01:56:30.525 --> 01:56:32.869
So, how's things in yonder trench?

01:56:34.029 --> 01:56:35.155
Delightful.

01:56:35.238 --> 01:56:39.368
We read, we knit sweaters, and we
train our rats to perform circus tricks.

01:56:39.659 --> 01:56:42.082
If you ever need any more rats,
we can always send ours over

01:56:42.204 --> 01:56:44.172
'cause we've more than we need,
strictly speaking.

01:56:45.916 --> 01:56:48.089
Besides, they scare off
all the pretty girls.

01:56:48.418 --> 01:56:49.886
Our girls aren't afraid of rats.

01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:53.423
Big strapping German girls, eh?

01:56:54.090 --> 01:56:56.263
Kind what give robust massages?

01:56:58.094 --> 01:56:59.767
Every Thursday.

01:56:59.888 --> 01:57:02.437
And they bring rum cake
on your birthday.

01:57:15.445 --> 01:57:17.573
Okay. All right.

01:57:22.077 --> 01:57:24.079
Look at that horse!

01:57:24.496 --> 01:57:28.000
Look at the muscles he's got.
Them long legs.

01:57:28.083 --> 01:57:31.758
They're made for running, horses.
Running away from danger.

01:57:33.171 --> 01:57:35.265
Running away is all they have.

01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:37.684
And yet we taught 'em opposite.

01:57:37.759 --> 01:57:40.387
Running into the fray.

01:57:41.012 --> 01:57:42.685
- A war horse.
- Yeah.

01:57:44.516 --> 01:57:45.859
War horse.

01:57:46.518 --> 01:57:48.191
There he is.

01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:50.773
What a strange beast you've become.

01:57:53.108 --> 01:57:54.451
And now?

01:57:54.526 --> 01:57:56.369
I'll take him back with me, yeah?

01:57:57.028 --> 01:58:01.204
Since I supplied the cutters,
the horse is mine. This is fair, no?

01:58:01.283 --> 01:58:03.706
In a pig's eye.
He's English, plain to see.

01:58:03.785 --> 01:58:06.664
- You mean because he's so filthy?
- Because he's so smart!

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:08.748
And you're none too clean yourself.

01:58:11.376 --> 01:58:14.550
We could box.
And the winner gets the horse.

01:58:17.048 --> 01:58:21.098
No, thanks, pet.
Must be careful not to start a war.

01:58:23.555 --> 01:58:25.808
Do you have a coin of any sort?

01:58:26.641 --> 01:58:28.314
- Coin toss?
- Yeah.

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:34.782
- All right, Fritz, you're on.
- My name is not Fritz.

01:58:35.066 --> 01:58:36.409
It is Peter.

01:58:37.861 --> 01:58:39.534
Peter. I'm Colin.

01:58:39.863 --> 01:58:41.991
- You call it, Colin.
- Heads.

01:58:47.621 --> 01:58:51.967
That's the face of my Kaiser,
and he does not look pleased with me.

01:58:53.793 --> 01:58:55.466
The horse is yours.

01:58:56.379 --> 01:58:58.052
Gone quiet, hasn't it?

01:58:58.715 --> 01:59:00.137
Yes.

01:59:00.216 --> 01:59:02.969
But wait half an hour
and we'll be shooting again.

01:59:03.053 --> 01:59:06.978
I'm a terrible shot, Pete.
Don't believe I'll ever hit a target.

01:59:08.391 --> 01:59:09.734
Thanks.

01:59:11.811 --> 01:59:13.233
Cheerio, mate.

01:59:13.313 --> 01:59:15.657
- You'll take good care of him, yes?
- I will.

01:59:15.732 --> 01:59:17.530
Our strange beast.

01:59:17.609 --> 01:59:19.953
And you take care
of your own strange self.

01:59:20.570 --> 01:59:21.822
Colin!

01:59:23.239 --> 01:59:24.866
A pair of German cutters.

01:59:24.949 --> 01:59:27.543
In memory of your handsome friend
from Dusseldorf.

01:59:27.619 --> 01:59:31.340
Thanks. I'll use them back
in the garden in South Shields.

01:59:31.414 --> 01:59:33.633
You keep your head down now, Pete,
my lad.

01:59:35.794 --> 01:59:38.798
Remarkable.
A remarkable horse!

02:00:16.501 --> 02:00:18.299
We're full up. Move on.

02:00:20.130 --> 02:00:21.803
We're full up. Move on.

02:00:24.676 --> 02:00:28.021
The gas got him.
We had to wait till morning.

02:00:32.517 --> 02:00:35.487
- This can't be all of us.
- This is all.

02:00:35.562 --> 02:00:37.360
All walking wounded

02:00:37.689 --> 02:00:40.943
away to the dressing station!

02:00:41.025 --> 02:00:44.199
Away to the dressing station!

02:00:58.168 --> 02:00:59.761
Just hold still.

02:00:59.836 --> 02:01:01.713
You're doing so well.

02:01:22.025 --> 02:01:24.278
- What's this doing here?
- We need a vet, sir.

02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:26.863
There are no vets.
There are scarcely any horses left.

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:29.745
He's cut all over,
but this leg here has got the worst of it.

02:01:36.748 --> 02:01:39.592
- It's probably tetanus. It's no good.
- Please, sir!

02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:42.258
I've all these men to take care of,
Corporal. You can see that, can't you?

02:01:42.378 --> 02:01:45.598
Please, sir,
this horse can pull through anything!

02:01:56.392 --> 02:01:57.814
What is it?

02:01:58.436 --> 02:02:02.191
It's a horse they found wandering about
in no man's land. Down you go.

02:02:02.273 --> 02:02:03.365
What kind of a horse?

02:02:03.441 --> 02:02:06.160
Bloody miraculous kind of a horse
be my guess.

02:02:06.236 --> 02:02:08.614
Nothing makes it out of no man's land.

02:02:13.743 --> 02:02:15.586
Miraculous horse.

02:02:17.747 --> 02:02:20.375
He was alive, you see, sir,
where nothing survives.

02:02:20.458 --> 02:02:23.257
Soto me and my mates,
to the men, sir, he's...

02:02:23.336 --> 02:02:24.713
Well, we have high hopes for him.

02:02:24.796 --> 02:02:26.844
You should shoot him now.

02:02:27.632 --> 02:02:30.852
- Oh, but I can't.
- It'd be a mercy, lad.

02:02:30.927 --> 02:02:33.180
That leg's not going to mend.

02:02:33.263 --> 02:02:34.606
Sergeant.

02:02:36.099 --> 02:02:38.147
Put him out of his misery.

02:02:43.815 --> 02:02:45.909
He's not going to
shoot it here, is he?

02:02:45.984 --> 02:02:47.406
What's going on here?

02:02:47.485 --> 02:02:49.237
They're going
to shoot the horse.

02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.368
Ladies, if you please.

02:02:51.447 --> 02:02:52.664
Come, nurses.

02:02:57.495 --> 02:03:01.170
All right, back off! Back off!

02:04:13.029 --> 02:04:15.908
Go on, do it again. Go on.

02:04:23.039 --> 02:04:24.211
Joey?

02:04:43.226 --> 02:04:46.776
Hello, Joey. Where you been then, eh?

02:04:48.064 --> 02:04:49.907
Where in the world you been?

02:04:50.024 --> 02:04:51.901
Do you know this man?

02:04:52.610 --> 02:04:54.988
- What's your name?
- Narracott.

02:04:55.071 --> 02:04:56.288
Private Albert Narracott, sir.

02:04:56.406 --> 02:04:59.831
It's just a random horse, Narracott,
and too badly injured.

02:04:59.909 --> 02:05:01.536
- Is this man in your care?
- Yes, sir.

02:05:01.619 --> 02:05:06.625
He's not random at all, sir!
He's my horse. I raised him, in Devon.

02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:09.548
Sir, look at his legs.

02:05:09.627 --> 02:05:12.380
He's got four white socks,
he's brown all over,

02:05:12.463 --> 02:05:14.807
and he has a white mark here, like so.

02:05:18.761 --> 02:05:20.889
- Take him back.
- Come on, son.

02:05:20.972 --> 02:05:23.475
Wait! You can't see 'cause of the mud!

02:05:57.133 --> 02:05:59.636
Four white socks.

02:06:54.941 --> 02:06:58.536
All right, break it up!
Clear off, the lot of ya!

02:06:58.945 --> 02:07:02.119
You see, sir? He's not random at all.

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:07.707
We'll attend to your horse.

02:07:07.787 --> 02:07:09.630
Patch him up best we can.

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:12.383
Treat him like the soldier he is.

02:07:13.292 --> 02:07:15.044
Thank you, sir.

02:07:41.070 --> 02:07:42.413
Gentlemen!

02:07:43.239 --> 02:07:44.582
Gentlemen!

02:07:44.699 --> 02:07:47.703
It falls on me to give you
some important news.

02:07:47.994 --> 02:07:51.919
At 11:00 today, in two minutes' time,

02:07:52.039 --> 02:07:54.337
the war will come to an end.

02:07:55.835 --> 02:07:58.930
The King and Queen
thank you for your service.

02:07:59.005 --> 02:08:01.007
We have been victorious,

02:08:01.090 --> 02:08:04.936
even if it's a higher price
than many of us might have imagined.

02:08:05.011 --> 02:08:06.934
When the bells ring out,

02:08:07.013 --> 02:08:10.392
and they will in a moment,
for the first time in four years,

02:08:10.474 --> 02:08:13.774
let us remember our brothers
fallen in the field,

02:08:13.853 --> 02:08:16.026
and thank God
for the end of this struggle,

02:08:17.148 --> 02:08:18.491
and victory.

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.582
I don't understand, sir.

02:08:36.375 --> 02:08:40.801
Officers' horses only. All other horses
are to be auctioned immediately.

02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:45.226
That is a complete and bloody outrage.
It's the lad's horse, sir! From Devon.

02:08:45.676 --> 02:08:47.303
He raised him up from a pup, he did.

02:08:47.386 --> 02:08:50.014
Trained him right up to the day
when the army came to town!

02:08:50.097 --> 02:08:52.771
These aren't my orders, Sergeant.

02:08:54.518 --> 02:08:57.772
You'll have to take him
to market tomorrow.

02:08:57.855 --> 02:08:59.232
That's all.

02:09:24.131 --> 02:09:25.883
We've all clubbed together.

02:09:26.175 --> 02:09:28.269
It's everything we have.

02:09:29.303 --> 02:09:32.648
There's 29 pounds there. Buy him back.

02:09:37.770 --> 02:09:38.896
Does the Major know?

02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:41.699
The Major put in 10. Mum's the word
where the Major's concerned.

02:09:41.774 --> 02:09:44.277
Your friend, on the crutches over there,

02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:47.239
even asked the Major to say
that Joey was his, an officer's horse,

02:09:47.321 --> 02:09:49.915
so that he could go back with the others.

02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:54.670
Come on, Narracott, get a move on.
We don't want to miss the show.

02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:07.054
<i>Seven pounds!
Seven pounds there!</i>

02:10:07.383 --> 02:10:11.183
Seven pounds! Eight pounds here!
Eight pounds!

02:10:11.304 --> 02:10:14.729
Ten pounds here! Any advance? Sold!

02:10:14.807 --> 02:10:17.731
All right. No one's going to bid
more than 15 for a thoroughbred.

02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:19.653
They want workhorses.

02:10:22.773 --> 02:10:24.275
Next one!

02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:27.612
We start at four pounds!

02:10:28.321 --> 02:10:29.994
Four pounds!

02:10:30.656 --> 02:10:32.829
- Five pounds!
- Five pounds here!

02:10:33.159 --> 02:10:35.002
- Any advance?
- Seven pounds!

02:10:35.077 --> 02:10:37.296
- Eight pounds!
- Nine pounds!

02:10:37.371 --> 02:10:39.044
- Nine.
- Ten pounds!

02:10:39.123 --> 02:10:40.249
Ten pounds!

02:10:40.333 --> 02:10:41.801
- Eleven!
- Eleven!

02:10:41.876 --> 02:10:46.006
It's the butcher from Cambrai. He's
been bidding for the best all morning.

02:10:46.088 --> 02:10:47.761
Eleven pounds.

02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:50.844
Let me handle this, Private. Fifteen!

02:10:50.926 --> 02:10:52.599
And let that be an end to it!

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:54.180
Fifteen pounds!

02:10:54.263 --> 02:10:56.891
- Sixteen!
- Sixteen pounds.

02:10:57.224 --> 02:10:58.567
Seventeen!

02:10:58.893 --> 02:11:03.239
Twenty of your English pounds.
And let that be the end of it, my friend.

02:11:03.522 --> 02:11:04.865
Twenty pounds!

02:11:05.733 --> 02:11:07.451
- Twenty-five!
Twenty-five pounds!

02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:09.787
Twenty-six.

02:11:09.862 --> 02:11:11.205
Twenty-six pounds!

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:13.624
- Twenty-seven!
Twenty-eight!

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:14.916
Twenty-eight pounds.

02:11:15.034 --> 02:11:16.160
Twenty-nine!

02:11:16.243 --> 02:11:17.620
And thirty!

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:19.626
Any advance on thirty pounds?

02:11:19.705 --> 02:11:21.707
One hundred pounds!

02:11:27.421 --> 02:11:29.844
And, sir, if you bid against me,

02:11:29.924 --> 02:11:34.521
I will sell the coat on my back
and bid to 110.

02:11:34.595 --> 02:11:37.724
And if you bid against me again,
I will sell my farm,

02:11:37.807 --> 02:11:39.901
and bid to a thousand!

02:11:43.104 --> 02:11:45.106
One hundred pounds!

02:11:46.732 --> 02:11:48.405
Going, going.

02:11:48.859 --> 02:11:50.031
Gone!

02:11:59.453 --> 02:12:00.670
Sir.

02:12:00.746 --> 02:12:03.169
I'll give you all your money,
everything you paid,

02:12:03.249 --> 02:12:04.341
when we get back to England.

02:12:04.417 --> 02:12:06.715
- I'll give you twice what...
- You don't know anything about him.

02:12:06.794 --> 02:12:09.047
But you're wrong, sir. I know everything.

02:12:09.130 --> 02:12:11.474
Yes, you found him.
I heard you found a horse

02:12:11.549 --> 02:12:13.347
in the wire between the armies.

02:12:13.426 --> 02:12:15.804
No, I found him. He raised him.

02:12:17.805 --> 02:12:21.355
When I heard about the miracle horse,
I traveled three days

02:12:21.434 --> 02:12:24.313
because I knew whose horse he was.

02:12:25.146 --> 02:12:26.989
My granddaughter's.

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:31.161
She saved his life.
He was everything to her.

02:12:31.235 --> 02:12:33.203
Where is your granddaughter?

02:12:33.279 --> 02:12:35.907
The war has taken everything
from everyone.

02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:38.459
He is all that I have left of her.

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:04.276
Don't be worried, boy, when I go.

02:13:04.393 --> 02:13:06.737
I won't worry over you none.

02:13:06.812 --> 02:13:08.780
Hey, I found you, didn't I?

02:13:10.316 --> 02:13:11.989
And you found me.

02:13:15.988 --> 02:13:17.490
And we'll both...

02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:21.289
We'll both know
that we made it through.

02:13:21.410 --> 02:13:22.753
Now come on.

02:13:23.829 --> 02:13:26.833
We're the lucky ones.
Always have been.

02:13:26.916 --> 02:13:29.260
Lucky since the day I met you.

02:13:31.754 --> 02:13:33.256
God be with you, sir.

02:13:36.175 --> 02:13:38.269
Do you know what this is?

02:13:42.598 --> 02:13:44.271
That's my father's.

02:13:44.934 --> 02:13:46.936
That's his regimental pennant.

02:13:53.859 --> 02:13:55.861
How did you come by this, sir?

02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.328
You may have this.

02:14:08.457 --> 02:14:11.301
Thank you ever so much for this, sir.

02:14:14.964 --> 02:14:16.341
And this.

02:14:25.558 --> 02:14:26.684
- Sir, I...
- No, no, no.

02:14:26.809 --> 02:14:29.653
Not necessary. He belongs to you.

02:14:30.813 --> 02:14:33.783
That is, of course,
what my little girl would have wanted.

02:14:33.857 --> 02:14:35.825
And she was the boss.

02:14:47.162 --> 02:14:48.505
What was her name?

02:14:49.415 --> 02:14:50.758
Emilie.

02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:56.171
Her name is Emilie.
