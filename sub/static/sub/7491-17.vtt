WEBVTT

00:03.250 --> 00:05.208
Phil's new garlic falafel balls
are disgusting.

00:05.959 --> 00:06.792
Surprising,

00:06.875 --> 00:08.583
considering the cook is a goat.

00:12.041 --> 00:14.000
Yeah, I know. These are awful.

00:14.792 --> 00:16.083
Then why do you keep eating them?

00:16.166 --> 00:18.625
Mm. 'Cause now I can do this...

00:23.625 --> 00:25.375
It's gross, but you gotta admit,

00:25.458 --> 00:26.625
the man's an artist.

00:28.166 --> 00:30.333
So Kim, are you coming
to see the movie with us tomorrow?

00:30.417 --> 00:31.542
It's playing here in the mall.

00:31.625 --> 00:32.458
What movie?

00:32.542 --> 00:34.417
Only the best monster movie ever made.

00:35.375 --> 00:37.625
"Attack of the Killer Zompyres"!

00:40.166 --> 00:42.166
- They're half-zombie--
- Half-vampire.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.500
And all-lame.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.875
If you guys wanna see a good movie,

00:45.959 --> 00:47.583
go see "The Horse Tamer."

00:47.667 --> 00:50.834
It's a romantic story about
a muscular 19-year-old boy,

00:50.917 --> 00:54.125
who sells his last shirt
to save a crippled horse.

00:55.583 --> 00:57.917
Just hearing those words
Makes me feel like less of a man.

00:59.583 --> 01:00.417
<i>Kim, come on,</i>

01:00.500 --> 01:02.083
see “Zompyres” with us. It'll be fun.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.125
I don't know.

01:04.208 --> 01:06.208
Come on, we should go together.

01:06.291 --> 01:07.250
Together?

01:08.291 --> 01:10.500
Well. Okay, I’m in.

01:10.583 --> 01:11.792
Cool.

01:11.875 --> 01:13.000
Hey, guys.

01:13.083 --> 01:14.917
You know what
my new Explorer Scout patch means?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.250
You crossed the street by yourself?

01:16.333 --> 01:18.333
- You threw out your nightlight?
- You peed in the woods?

01:18.417 --> 01:19.375
No, no.

01:19.458 --> 01:20.667
And that's none of your business.

01:22.375 --> 01:24.041
What is means is I’m leader of my troop.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.000
Aren't you the only one in your--

01:26.083 --> 01:27.000
Leader of my troop!

01:28.959 --> 01:32.375
My scout master says I’m brave, bold
and fearless.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.250
Great! So you're coming
to see "Zompyres" with us?

01:34.291 --> 01:35.750
Are you nuts?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.291
I looked at the commercial for that thing

01:37.375 --> 01:39.542
and I spent two days hiding
in my mother's hamper.

01:40.709 --> 01:41.667
Yo, Eddie.

01:41.750 --> 01:42.834
Check this out.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.208
Uh-oh.

01:49.291 --> 01:51.041
Oh, it's going the wrong way.

01:51.166 --> 01:52.834
Uh-oh. No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:52.917 --> 01:54.166
Yo, Phil. Phil! I need the key!

01:54.250 --> 01:55.458
Key to the bathroom now!

01:55.542 --> 01:57.375
Oh, oh, okay. Let's see, uh...

01:57.458 --> 01:59.625
This one? No, that's not the one.

01:59.709 --> 02:01.917
This-- Oh, this is the key to my diary.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.542
But, uh-- whoa!

02:03.625 --> 02:04.750
I guess he really had to go!

02:48.041 --> 02:50.250
We've known each other for a while now and

02:50.333 --> 02:51.583
I feel a spark between us.

02:52.375 --> 02:55.542
And when I look into your eyes,
I can tell you feel the exact same...

02:57.000 --> 02:57.875
way.

02:57.959 --> 02:58.792
Not buying it.

02:58.875 --> 03:00.291
- Aw!
- When you say

03:00.375 --> 03:02.417
"Spark between us," you gotta be breathy.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.291
"Spark between us."

03:05.417 --> 03:07.291
Ooh. That's good. Do that again.

03:07.375 --> 03:08.709
No.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.542
Why are so nervous
about asking Katie out anyway?

03:12.625 --> 03:14.000
Dude, I’ve had a crush on her

03:14.083 --> 03:15.667
since we finger painted in kindergarten.

03:15.750 --> 03:18.166
I was using blue. She was using yellow.

03:19.041 --> 03:20.542
Together we made green, Jack.

03:20.625 --> 03:21.458
Green!

03:23.041 --> 03:23.875
Green?

03:23.959 --> 03:25.583
Dude, there she is! Go ask her.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.625
Come on. Go, go. Go!

03:29.333 --> 03:31.291
Uh, uh, Katie.

03:32.625 --> 03:35.000
I wanna know if you wanna go
to the “Zompyre” movie with me.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.542
Are you seriously asking her out?

03:38.709 --> 03:39.667
Okay.

03:40.917 --> 03:41.875
Here's the deal.

03:42.917 --> 03:44.375
She'll go out with you,

03:44.458 --> 03:45.542
<i>if Jack</i>

03:45.625 --> 03:47.709
- will go with me.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!

03:47.792 --> 03:49.917
That'll happen. Uh, so--

03:50.667 --> 03:52.125
So, see ya tonight.

03:54.083 --> 03:55.542
Dude, she said yes!

03:55.625 --> 03:56.583
Yes!
- I’m going to the movies

03:56.667 --> 03:57.667
with her tonight.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.834
I finally finished
my science fair project.

04:01.917 --> 04:03.625
It's a light refractometer.

04:03.709 --> 04:05.709
By using a series of convex mirrors,

04:05.792 --> 04:08.250
I’m able to intensify
a single beam of light.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.709
What's your project?

04:10.750 --> 04:12.333
Grew a bean in a cup.

04:14.542 --> 04:15.583
Kim.

04:17.667 --> 04:18.792
Lindsay.

04:24.166 --> 04:25.041
Whoa-ho!

04:25.125 --> 04:27.250
-
- No!

04:27.291 --> 04:30.500
My light refractometer! It's ruined!

04:30.583 --> 04:32.625
It's gonna take me all night
to build another one.

04:33.750 --> 04:34.834
You want a bean?

04:39.000 --> 04:39.834
You!

04:39.917 --> 04:41.000
I have a date! Not the face!

04:41.083 --> 04:43.000
Not the face!

04:49.959 --> 04:51.875
Uh, Eddie?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.250
What are you doing here?

04:53.333 --> 04:55.000
I thought you were too scared
to see this movie.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.166
Now that I’m scout leader,
I’m going to show people

04:57.250 --> 04:58.542
- my bravery.

05:02.166 --> 05:03.208
What's that?

05:03.291 --> 05:04.834
A cartoon dancing hotdog

05:04.917 --> 05:06.291
telling you the snack bar is open.

05:06.792 --> 05:07.792
Well, joke's on them.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.917
That terrifying wiener
made me lose my appetite.

05:13.333 --> 05:14.583
<i>Kim.</i>

05:14.667 --> 05:15.667
Lindsay.

05:15.750 --> 05:16.959
You a “Zompyre” fan?

05:17.041 --> 05:18.917
Not really. I’m here on a date.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.250
Oh, I’m sorry.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.959
You probably don't know what that is.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.709
Actually, I’m on a date too.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.000
Ohh.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.917
And here's my date now.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.917
Hi, Jack.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.792
Wha-- You're here on a date with Jack?

05:32.875 --> 05:35.041
- Yes, I am!
- I’m here with who now?

05:36.208 --> 05:38.166
Come on, Jack. I saved us seats.

05:38.834 --> 05:40.625
Uh, buh-bye, Kim.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.625
Whoa, you're here on a date with Lindsay?

05:43.709 --> 05:45.667
Uh, no, no. I-- I’m not.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.959
Jerry, what is going on?

05:48.041 --> 05:49.500
<i>No hablo ingles, señor.</i>

05:49.834 --> 05:50.834
Jerry!

05:51.458 --> 05:53.834
Dude, it was the only way
that I would get Katie to go out with me.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.625
You gotta do this for me, man. Please.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.291
Fine.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.041
Kim, would you be okay if I sat with--

06:00.125 --> 06:01.542
Of course! Yeah.

06:01.625 --> 06:02.792
Apparently Lindsay's your date.

06:02.875 --> 06:03.917
Why wouldn't you sit with your date?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.458
And since you and I aren't on a date,

06:05.542 --> 06:07.583
I’ll go sit with Eddie!

06:08.750 --> 06:09.750
Yeah, it's just...

06:13.667 --> 06:15.000
You didn't save me a seat?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.208
Why should I?

06:16.333 --> 06:17.583
It's not like we're on a date.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.083
Are we?

06:27.500 --> 06:29.709
Uh, hi. Excuse me, sir. Is that seat--

06:29.792 --> 06:30.834
Rudy?

06:31.750 --> 06:32.959
What are you doing?

06:33.041 --> 06:34.417
Getting the senior discount.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.208
Now sit down before you blow my cover.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.000
Hey, just so you know.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.709
I go to the little boys' room

06:41.792 --> 06:44.208
between 30 and 40 times an hour.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.417
Oh, seriously?

06:50.500 --> 06:52.208
Who is the jerk?

06:52.291 --> 06:53.792
First time at the movies?

06:53.875 --> 06:55.709
Haha, am I right?

06:55.792 --> 06:57.333
Am-- Oh, that's me, isn't it?

06:59.125 --> 07:01.000
Ohh, boy!

07:01.917 --> 07:04.959
Trying to get another senior discount,
are we, Rudy?

07:05.041 --> 07:09.041
Well, you may have dodged me
at the early bird buffet,

07:09.125 --> 07:10.834
but I gotcha now!

07:10.917 --> 07:13.625
I’m not Rudy. I’m Sammy!

07:13.709 --> 07:16.375
Yeah, and I’m Queen of the Zompyres.

07:18.208 --> 07:21.625
Dancing wieners.

07:33.166 --> 07:34.166
Seriously?

07:34.250 --> 07:35.500
They just left me here?

07:37.250 --> 07:38.625
Nice friends.

07:47.667 --> 07:48.959
Jack?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.375
Rudy?

07:58.125 --> 07:59.250
Anybody?

08:06.291 --> 08:07.709
Jerry? What happened?

08:07.792 --> 08:08.917
What's going on around here?

08:15.375 --> 08:17.375
What it do...

08:17.458 --> 08:18.375
Girl?

08:30.083 --> 08:31.291
<i>Hey, zompyre!</i>

08:44.583 --> 08:45.917
Hey!

08:46.000 --> 08:47.583
Over here, pasty face.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.667
It's falafel time.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.417
Hoo-ah! Right between the fangs!

09:02.000 --> 09:03.125
Jack, you all right?

09:03.959 --> 09:05.000
How do you know my name?

09:06.709 --> 09:08.959
Hey, that was my last falafel ball.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.959
It's only gonna slow him down
for a few minutes.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.709
We should get back in the rebel base.

09:12.792 --> 09:15.583
I’m not going anywhere
until someone tells me what's going on.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.083
Or you know, we can go inside first.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.208
I’m flexible.

09:21.959 --> 09:23.250
What is going on?

09:23.834 --> 09:25.500
I’ll tell you what's going on.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.250
We're at war with the zompyres.

09:28.166 --> 09:29.917
Yeah. When they first came
we thought there was

09:30.000 --> 09:32.750
one or two... Or three or four,

09:32.834 --> 09:34.041
- five--
- Rudy!

09:36.041 --> 09:37.166
There were thousands of 'em.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.625
They came crawling up
from the sewers below Seaford.

09:40.709 --> 09:42.959
I was on the toilet when one came up.

09:45.208 --> 09:47.375
They multiplied by
burping into humans' faces.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.583
And the worst part,

09:49.667 --> 09:50.959
they never say "Excuse me."

09:55.500 --> 09:56.500
Where did you go?

09:56.583 --> 09:57.834
Jack sent me to get supplies.

09:57.917 --> 09:59.291
Fresh water, batteries?

09:59.417 --> 10:00.291
Hair spray.

10:03.166 --> 10:06.333
The end of the world doesn't have to mean
the end of my beautiful bouncy hair.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.917
I’m Lindsay, Jack's girlfriend.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.291
Who are you?

10:14.375 --> 10:16.750
I really hate this world.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.083
Her name's Kim.

10:19.166 --> 10:20.333
We found her wandering outside

10:20.417 --> 10:22.125
and had to use our last
falafel ball to save her.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.875
You wasted our last ball on her?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.375
I don't trust her.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.041
Give her the Test.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.291
There's only one person

10:31.375 --> 10:32.458
That can give her...

10:33.458 --> 10:34.625
the Test.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.417
I’ll summon the rebel leader.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.458
- Rebel leader!
-

10:49.166 --> 10:50.667
Can we trust you?

10:50.750 --> 10:52.709
Um. Yeah.

10:52.792 --> 10:54.333
She passed. Hey, you play softball?

10:54.417 --> 10:55.667
We really need a first baseman.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.041
It's from the Professor!

11:03.125 --> 11:04.917
He wants us to come to his secret lab.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.458
He's found a way to turn zompyres
back into humans.

11:07.542 --> 11:10.166
This means we'll have something
we haven't had in a while.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.250
Toilet paper?

11:11.333 --> 11:13.583
No. Hope.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.458
Let me know when you get toilet paper.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.583
Welcome, rebels, to my secret lab.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.333
Thank you for removing your shoes.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.041
I give you mankind's salvation.

11:39.125 --> 11:41.041
The Krupnick Coil!

11:41.417 --> 11:42.583
<i>This super powerful</i>

11:42.709 --> 11:45.583
refractometer emits a light so intense,

11:45.667 --> 11:48.291
it pierces the zompyre's inner darkness,

11:48.417 --> 11:50.000
turning them back into humans.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
<i>Yeah. Not gonna happen.</i>

11:57.875 --> 11:58.709
Oopsie.

11:58.792 --> 11:59.917
You fiend!

12:00.000 --> 12:02.458
He just destroyed
our only chance of survival

12:02.542 --> 12:05.291
against the most evil force
man has ever known.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.166
And he didn't take off his shoes.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.291
How did you find
the Professor's secret underground lab?

12:11.375 --> 12:13.208
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?

12:14.583 --> 12:16.208
I did it. For us.

12:17.959 --> 12:18.917
I made a deal, Jack.

12:19.792 --> 12:21.500
The zompyres'll spare us.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.792
You and I can be together.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.375
Yeah... About that deal.

12:28.667 --> 12:29.500
I lied.

12:34.667 --> 12:37.500
I’m gonna go on record and say
she may be the worst girlfriend ever.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.125
Sir, it has been an honor
to serve with you.

12:53.208 --> 12:55.375
One last request, rebel leader.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.625
Permission to cry like a little girl.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.625
Permission granted.

13:01.875 --> 13:02.875
Jack, what are you doing?

13:02.959 --> 13:03.917
Getting us out of here.

13:05.166 --> 13:06.041
Can't

13:06.125 --> 13:08.458
Resist urge...

13:08.542 --> 13:09.792
to...

13:09.875 --> 13:11.166
Dance!

13:11.583 --> 13:13.667
Zompyres, let's do this thing.

13:24.583 --> 13:26.375
Oh, really, Zompyre Jerry?

13:26.458 --> 13:27.542
Really?

13:34.583 --> 13:36.917
How did you know that music
would make Jerry dance?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.625
Well, before he was a zompyre,

13:38.709 --> 13:40.166
Jerry was one of us.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.375
Music was his weakness.

13:42.625 --> 13:43.917
And girls.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.417
And math. And tying shoelaces.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.750
He had a lot of weaknesses.

13:50.208 --> 13:53.166
The only thing left of my refractometer
is this crystal diode

13:53.250 --> 13:55.458
wrapped up in this wad of toilet paper.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.917
I’ll take the toilet paper.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.625
See you people in about a week.

14:02.959 --> 14:04.750
Is there anything we can do
with the crystal diode?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Well, there is one prototype coil.

14:08.875 --> 14:12.917
But it's in the darkest, scariest,
most evil place on Earth.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.875
The snake cave on the edge of town

14:14.959 --> 14:17.750
that goes down to the bowels
of the underworld?

14:17.875 --> 14:18.875
Worse.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.458
- School!
-

14:25.417 --> 14:27.417
We're going to the zompyres' lair.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.583
- The school.
- That place is scarier

14:29.667 --> 14:31.208
than the snake caves
on the edge of town that

14:31.291 --> 14:33.041
reach into the bowels of the underworld.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.333
That's why we need
all the falafel balls you got.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.291
Happy to help.

14:37.875 --> 14:40.000
$500!

14:40.083 --> 14:40.875
Each!

14:40.959 --> 14:42.500
But we're trying to save humanity!

14:42.583 --> 14:43.959
Oh, why didn't you say so?

14:44.792 --> 14:47.208
$1000!

14:47.291 --> 14:48.458
Each!

14:49.000 --> 14:50.792
Don't you care about saving the world?

14:50.875 --> 14:52.417
No, not really.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.458
The zompyre apocalypse
has been great for the business.

14:56.375 --> 14:57.583
No falafel ball for you!

14:57.667 --> 14:58.583
Get out!

14:59.792 --> 15:01.625
-
<i>Tootsie.</i>

15:01.709 --> 15:04.083
What's wrong?
Something seems different about you?

15:04.709 --> 15:06.333
Is it my demonic red eyes?

15:06.417 --> 15:07.750
My mouth full of fangs?

15:07.834 --> 15:09.875
The fact that I’m talking
to you right now?

15:11.208 --> 15:12.875
What was the first one again?

15:12.959 --> 15:15.250
I’m a zompyre goat, you dimwit!

15:15.333 --> 15:16.834
Yes, that's it! That's the one!

15:19.375 --> 15:20.333
Look out!

15:20.375 --> 15:21.750
No!
Eddie!

15:23.625 --> 15:24.750
Tootsie!

15:27.917 --> 15:29.125
Eddie!

15:29.208 --> 15:30.709
Not my Tootsie!

15:46.250 --> 15:47.959
You really think this
is going to work, Jack?

15:48.041 --> 15:50.041
Yes. They won't be awake for hours

15:50.125 --> 15:51.083
and if they do wake up,

15:51.166 --> 15:52.750
this makeup will help us blend in.

15:52.834 --> 15:55.959
I’m sorry for yelling
at you to do my makeup, Kim.

15:56.041 --> 15:57.333
But as the new rebel leader,

15:57.417 --> 15:59.417
it wouldn't look right
if I had to do my own.

16:02.750 --> 16:03.750
No, I get it.

16:04.208 --> 16:05.250
Happy to help.

16:08.417 --> 16:09.250
If it's here,

16:09.291 --> 16:10.959
the coil will be in the multipurpose room

16:11.041 --> 16:12.750
with the other science fair projects.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.250
Guys, we have to be quiet.

16:14.291 --> 16:15.959
Nobody make any loud noises.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.625
Seriously?

16:20.709 --> 16:21.834
Who's the jerk?

16:21.917 --> 16:23.875
First time in an evil zompyre's--

16:23.959 --> 16:25.041
Oh, wait. That's me.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.542
Sorry. That's just poor planning.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.375
Oh, no. You woke up Joan!

16:35.458 --> 16:36.792
Queen of the Zompyres.

16:37.291 --> 16:42.166
Ohh, lookee what we have here.

16:42.250 --> 16:46.125
A cute little panda boy and his friends.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.291
I’m not a panda.

16:47.417 --> 16:48.834
Kim, why does she think I’m a panda?

16:48.917 --> 16:50.458
Oh, you panda'd me, didn't you?

16:51.542 --> 16:52.625
A little bit.

16:53.917 --> 16:58.000
How dare you dress up
and sneak into my lair?

17:03.417 --> 17:05.583
Pandas.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.250
Phil, cover us!

17:08.333 --> 17:10.041
Okay, Jack. I’ll hold them back.

17:16.792 --> 17:19.208
Ah, is that all you got, zompyres?

17:19.291 --> 17:20.542
You think you're all that?

17:20.625 --> 17:22.500
You're not so tough, huh?

17:22.583 --> 17:24.917
Whoa! Okay, I didn't see that coming.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.709
Wait, wait. I was just kidding.

17:26.792 --> 17:27.542
Go back to bed.

17:27.625 --> 17:28.917
<i>♪ Back to bed ♪</i>

17:29.000 --> 17:30.208
<i>♪ Nighty night ♪</i>

17:30.291 --> 17:33.500
<i>♪ Sweet zompyres sleep tight ♪</i>

17:36.834 --> 17:38.959
The coil has to be around here somewhere.

17:41.834 --> 17:43.125
Look.

17:43.208 --> 17:45.083
Some loser grew a bean in a cup.

17:48.709 --> 17:49.875
Here's the coil!

17:49.959 --> 17:53.166
I just need time to install
the crystal diode, and it'll work.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.834
I don't think that's gonna happen.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.458
Jack! Kim! Stop him!

18:07.625 --> 18:08.959
Kim, falafel ball!

18:13.792 --> 18:15.458
-
- Oh, no!

18:15.542 --> 18:17.125
I hate school bathrooms.

18:22.875 --> 18:25.291
Kim, we did it. We did it!

18:25.375 --> 18:27.000
Jack, behind you!

18:27.083 --> 18:29.125
It's your crazy zompyre ex-girlfriend!

18:34.375 --> 18:35.333
No!

18:36.291 --> 18:37.417
- Jack?
- Kim.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.750
Get away from me.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.500
How are we coming with that coil?

18:40.583 --> 18:43.125
The diode's in place.
I just need to turn it--

18:47.333 --> 18:48.834
Little bump in the road.

19:12.291 --> 19:13.542
What are you doing?

19:13.625 --> 19:14.542
Don't turn her, Jack.

19:14.625 --> 19:18.000
You are supposed to be spending
the rest of eternity with me.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.166
I’ve literally been a zompyre
for 10 seconds

19:20.250 --> 19:21.625
and you're already smothering me.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.417
<i>You just wanna burp on her
because you like her.</i>

19:25.500 --> 19:26.667
- I knew it! Admit it!
- Oh.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.667
So this is how it's gonna be
for all eternity.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.500
- My mother warned me about...
- Let it go, woman!

19:30.583 --> 19:32.667
- ...boys like you!
- Shh! Shh!

19:33.375 --> 19:35.250
Stop! Just shh!

19:35.291 --> 19:37.417
You guys need to lighten up.

19:46.917 --> 19:47.959
You okay?

19:48.041 --> 19:49.750
You did it. You saved me.

19:49.834 --> 19:52.083
I was not gonna let you
spend eternity with her.

19:54.291 --> 19:57.375
You belong with me. You belong with me.

19:57.458 --> 19:59.166
You belong with me.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.834
Not gonna happen, cookie.

20:00.917 --> 20:04.542
I’ve been with the same woman
since before electricity.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.458
It was all just a dream.

20:12.625 --> 20:14.250
Let's go.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.000
I had so much fun with you.

20:16.083 --> 20:17.625
Wanna go grab some froyo?

20:17.709 --> 20:19.458
I'd love to...

20:20.792 --> 20:21.917
<i>I, I just--</i>

20:22.000 --> 20:24.041
I have to help Kim with her, um...

20:25.458 --> 20:27.000
Science project!

20:27.083 --> 20:28.291
I’m growing a bean.

20:29.709 --> 20:31.083
I have to help her grow a bean.

20:32.417 --> 20:33.500
Buh-bye, Lindsay.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.542
Oh, thank you so much for the save.

20:38.625 --> 20:40.959
Sitting next to her
was like sitting next to a zombie.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.041
So did you like the movie?

20:42.125 --> 20:43.166
Couldn't have hated it more.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.667
But I like the way it ended.

20:46.333 --> 20:47.667
Yeah, I didn't really like the ending.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.458
The way the zombie and the vampire...

20:56.291 --> 20:58.458
I’m never going to a PG movie again.

21:01.417 --> 21:03.291
<i>Maybe your back legs don't work so well,</i>

21:03.375 --> 21:05.500
<i>but I used my bicycle
to make you some braces.</i>

21:06.834 --> 21:08.834
<i>Oh, yeah! There you go!</i>

21:08.917 --> 21:10.792
<i>There you go, boy. Now run!</i>

21:11.417 --> 21:12.709
- <i>Ha!</i>
-

21:14.959 --> 21:16.542
This may be the worst
movie I’ve ever seen.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.166
But I’m glad I’m here with you.

21:19.250 --> 21:20.959
Yeah, me too.

21:21.041 --> 21:24.333
This is the best movie I’ve ever seen.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.041
Run like the wind, Juniper.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.583
Like the wind!
