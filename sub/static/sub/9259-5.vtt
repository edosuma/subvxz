[Auctioneer Continues]

01:17.795 --> 01:20.355
[Mackey]
Sucks / didn't bring my checkbook.

01:20.465 --> 01:23.434
Laverneous'd pop a vessel, he knew
all these whiteys were scopin' out his ride.

01:23.534 --> 01:27.095
[Monica] / put ads
in El Clasificado and the Sentinel...

01:27.205 --> 01:29.105
but apparently only the Times
crowd was interested.

01:29.207 --> 01:32.506
[Auctioneer] Who wants to go 31?
Thirty-one? Going.

01:32.610 --> 01:36.706
Going. Sold, $31,000.

01:36.814 --> 01:39.374
Okay, now we have
lot number 611.

01:39.484 --> 01:42.282
I did a little show-and-tell
for the city attorney last night.

01:42.387 --> 01:45.948
- She sign off on the injunctions?
- [Auctioneer Continues]

01:46.057 --> 01:48.116
One-niners are
Antwon Mitchell's foot soldiers.

01:48.226 --> 01:51.286
These injunctions are gonna keep them
off the street pushin' dope.

01:51.396 --> 01:53.694
- He's gonna feel the pressure.
- Yeah, he's already feeling it.

01:53.798 --> 01:56.266
This is gonna...
jack up the pain.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.892
[Auctioneer]
Sold, $ 17,000. Okay, next item.

01:59.003 --> 02:03.531
Lot number 684.
Yamaha motorcycle, minimal damage.

02:09.646 --> 02:12.775
Let's make this quick.
We gotta clock in to the boss.

02:12.884 --> 02:14.977
You forget I'm your boss?

02:15.086 --> 02:17.145
- What do you need?
- This address.

02:17.255 --> 02:20.691
Chink herone dealer.
Hear a shipment came in last night.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.522
And you don't like competitors.

02:23.628 --> 02:26.597
You know, Bill Gates
has his hit. I got mine.

02:26.697 --> 02:29.530
[Army]
Yeah, and bustin'dealers is ours, so sure.

02:29.634 --> 02:31.727
All right, we'll pay a visit...

02:31.836 --> 02:35.363
do our part to keep
the, uh, black tar monopoly safe.

02:35.473 --> 02:40.308
Plus, I'm gonna need
half his inventory.

02:40.411 --> 02:43.710
We're good on demand, but we're light on
supply 'cause of your intel failure last week.

02:43.815 --> 02:47.615
We give you information. We don't
move product, get hung up in your shit.

02:47.718 --> 02:49.743
Hey.

02:49.854 --> 02:52.345
I'll beep you
when we got the stuff.

02:53.658 --> 02:56.684
Bitch with a badge
doin' my bidding.

02:56.794 --> 02:58.785
It's a wonderful day.

02:58.896 --> 03:01.956
[Laughs]

03:03.901 --> 03:06.369
As you all know, we had
our first auction this morning.

03:06.471 --> 03:08.371
Try to keep your jaws
off the floor.

03:08.473 --> 03:11.203
We raised over $900,000.

03:11.309 --> 03:13.402
[Cheering]

03:13.511 --> 03:15.411
Guess taking houses is profitable.

03:15.513 --> 03:18.971
That's money out of the bad guys'hands
and back into the community.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.574
Yeah, and a third comes to us.

03:21.686 --> 03:24.416
That's not the only good news.

03:24.522 --> 03:28.891
Officers Sofer and Lowe have done
a fantastic job documenting the One-niners.

03:28.993 --> 03:32.429
And thanks to their hard work,
we got injunctions.

03:32.530 --> 03:37.229
After we serve these, if you see two
or more One-niners together in Farmington...

03:37.335 --> 03:39.997
that's called "congregating in groups,"
and that's jail time.

03:40.104 --> 03:42.436
The One-niners
arejust the beginning...

03:42.540 --> 03:44.508
so let's get these served
by the end of the day.

03:44.609 --> 03:46.509
Match the glamour shots
to the injunctions.

03:46.611 --> 03:49.239
If you have any questions,
get in touch with Danny orJulien.

03:49.347 --> 03:52.475
- Can't find them, come to me.
- [Monica] Thanks, everyone.

03:52.583 --> 03:53.317
- [Mackey] Any word on the girl?
- I talked to Angie's friends, kids at school.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.785
- [Mackey] Any word on the girl?
- I talked to Angie's friends, kids at school.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.912
No one's seen her, man.
She dropped off the map.

03:58.022 --> 03:59.853
Her mom goes
in the ground tomorrow.

03:59.957 --> 04:02.084
This girl checks in with me
once a week. Now nothing.

04:02.193 --> 04:04.024
- Talking about Angie?
- Yeah.

04:04.128 --> 04:06.392
You speak to the family
in Georgia?

04:06.497 --> 04:09.091
- [Man] Let's go.
- [Chattering]

04:09.200 --> 04:11.225
She, um-She hasn't been
back to her apartment.

04:11.335 --> 04:14.498
Didn't pack any bags.

04:14.605 --> 04:18.404
What if Antwon Mitchell found out
Angie gave up the cul-de-sac bust?

04:18.509 --> 04:21.603
That would have to come
from here. You ran that.

04:21.712 --> 04:24.078
Is there any chance
that word got out?

04:24.181 --> 04:25.648
None.

04:25.750 --> 04:29.379
Well, I'm glad to hear I.A.D.
cleared you on the shooting.

04:29.487 --> 04:31.045
Yeah, thanks
for the word you put in.

04:31.155 --> 04:32.884
Your C.O.'s anxious to get you back.

04:32.990 --> 04:35.185
I took personal time the rest
of the week to look for Angie.

04:35.293 --> 04:37.818
- Let me know what you find.
- All right.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.898
- [Man] Sorry about that.
- Come here.

04:46.404 --> 04:48.770
What the hell was that?

04:48.873 --> 04:51.205
Shane is slipping
inside info to Antwon.

04:51.309 --> 04:54.142
Angie goes missing the night
we take his distribution center.

04:54.245 --> 04:57.339
She fingered, and I'm supposed
to pretend those two things aren't related?

04:57.448 --> 05:01.407
- Shane wouldn't give up a girl.
- He was down for planting
evidence, burning a body.

05:01.519 --> 05:03.851
- We were all part of that.
- He'd have been down for a lot more...

05:03.955 --> 05:06.446
if we hadn't been there
to rein in his shit.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.457
On his own, we got no idea
what he would do.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.550
We're keeping Shane out of trouble.

05:10.661 --> 05:12.686
You makin' noises
to my boss doesn't help.

05:12.797 --> 05:15.664
He didn't do this.
I'll look around to make sure of it.

05:15.766 --> 05:18.394
You keep looking for Angie.

05:25.476 --> 05:28.206
[Rock]

05:28.312 --> 05:31.577
[Men, Women Chattering]

05:31.682 --> 05:36.585
[Ends]

05:36.687 --> 05:39.656
[Chattering, Shouting]

05:39.757 --> 05:44.057
[Siren Chirps]

05:47.665 --> 05:50.429
Oh, you knuckleheads
make it way too easy!

05:50.534 --> 05:52.559
[Ronnie] Game's over.
Against the fence.

05:52.670 --> 05:55.195
Get against the fence right now!
Move! Move your ass!

05:55.306 --> 05:57.831
- You!
- Face me!

05:57.942 --> 06:00.103
- We were just ballin'.
- Yeah?

06:00.211 --> 06:03.908
Well, from now on, T-Gun, a cop sees you
so much as playin' with your own dicks...

06:04.015 --> 06:06.575
in the same room,
you're going to County.

06:06.684 --> 06:09.676
Oh, this one's for you, Notch.
It's called an injunction.

06:09.787 --> 06:13.655
You're all documented members of
a known criminal organization.

06:13.758 --> 06:16.784
Judge thinks you're
domestic terrorists, ladies.

06:16.894 --> 06:19.419
- I ain't no sheet-head.
- You're just a shithead.

06:19.530 --> 06:21.794
Injunctions are zero tolerance.

06:21.899 --> 06:24.993
That means no associating
with known bangers-

06:25.102 --> 06:27.229
No bangin'with your homies.
No riding together in cars.

06:27.338 --> 06:29.238
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

06:29.340 --> 06:32.241
You tryin' to say it's illegal for me
to hang out with my own brother?

06:32.343 --> 06:35.210
- He your real brother?
- Yeah, like we came out of the same vagina.

06:36.514 --> 06:38.675
Well, the court says
you're One-niners first.

06:38.783 --> 06:41.377
/ mean, what y'all think?
We bangin'24-7?

06:41.485 --> 06:43.510
It's not up to me.

06:45.256 --> 06:47.121
All right, see who we got.

06:47.224 --> 06:49.556
I'll tell the bartender his
One-niner clientele is banned.

06:49.660 --> 06:54.120
All right, police! You know the dance!
You know the dance!

06:54.231 --> 06:56.756
- Buy me a damn drink!
- Let's go.

06:56.867 --> 06:58.801
- You gonna buy me a Hennessy, bitch!
- Break up!

06:58.903 --> 07:01.497
- Break it up!
- Look, I'm D.E.A.

07:01.605 --> 07:03.436
- What?
- I'm undercover.

07:03.541 --> 07:05.736
You bust this place,
you're gonna screw it all up.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.607
- Get off me, pig!
- Hold it right there!

07:08.713 --> 07:10.772
- Don't shoot. / got him.
- Get me a Henny and Coke!

07:10.881 --> 07:13.475
- Hold it right there!
- I got him.

07:13.584 --> 07:17.611
It's okay. This is the guy that Billings
was looking for on that 211.

07:17.722 --> 07:19.747
All right, come on, asshole.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.348
- [Whimpering]
- Come on.

07:23.928 --> 07:26.795
Hospital says that alkie you knocked
around barely has a bruise.

07:26.897 --> 07:28.797
Drunks are like Superballs.

07:28.899 --> 07:31.800
Bounce 'em off the floors,
they never get a scratch.

07:31.902 --> 07:33.802
/'ll have to remember that one.

07:33.904 --> 07:36.202
Credentials cleared.

07:36.307 --> 07:38.434
Agent Hendricks say
what he was doing at Lucky's?

07:38.542 --> 07:40.908
[Hendricks]
Couldn't tell you if / wanted to.

07:41.011 --> 07:42.945
How long you been
on the One-niners?

07:43.047 --> 07:44.947
A while.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.074
Obviously we're tilling
the same ground.

07:47.184 --> 07:51.518
One-niner heroin trade.
Probably Antwon Mitchell too.

07:51.622 --> 07:53.522
I'm just a guy on the street.

07:53.624 --> 07:56.320
Say / talk to the guy
in the corner office?

07:56.427 --> 07:58.327
You'd have to be pretty convincing.

07:58.429 --> 08:00.624
Well, give me a name.
I'll work on my sales pitch.

08:00.765 --> 08:03.029
Federal investigations
take precedence.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.694
We say keep away from that bar,
you better do it.

08:05.803 --> 08:07.703
We can help you.

08:07.805 --> 08:09.705
You don't even have working lights.

08:09.807 --> 08:13.140
I'm bringing the place into the 21 st century-
rewiring, high-speed Internet.

08:13.244 --> 08:15.303
Meanwhile, here's the low-tech version.

08:15.412 --> 08:18.313
You guys're into the One-niners.
We know everything about 'em-

08:18.415 --> 08:20.406
ink, homies, drug dens.

08:20.518 --> 08:22.713
And the bangers know
that we're plugged into them.

08:22.820 --> 08:25.584
We do the bust for you,
get the heroin off the street.

08:25.689 --> 08:27.714
You get closer
to Antwon Mitchell...

08:27.825 --> 08:30.055
and your agent's cover
isn't compromised.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.390
You're making
a lot of assumptions.

08:32.496 --> 08:35.090
The D.E.A.'s set up
on a One-niner bar.

08:35.198 --> 08:37.394
One-niners are front
and center in the tar trade.

08:37.501 --> 08:40.629
I'm a local, not a moron.

08:40.738 --> 08:43.229
Antwon never sees
the light of day again.

08:43.340 --> 08:45.331
I host the party.

08:47.845 --> 08:51.679
One-niners have been trading
stolen cars for tar heroin.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.580
Pipeline runs between L.A.
and El Salvador.

08:54.685 --> 08:56.585
[Mackey]
Tar comes from Mexico.

08:56.687 --> 08:58.848
[Agent] /t's grown there.
/mported through El Salvador.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.891
Salvadoran named Spider's
the go-between with the bangers.

09:01.992 --> 09:04.222
Has a garage of stolen Camrys
on Broadway.

09:04.328 --> 09:07.320
How did the El Salvadorans get
hooked up with the One-niners?

09:07.431 --> 09:10.400
Antwon. Back in Lompoc, he took
advantage of some bad blood.

09:10.501 --> 09:13.470
He made an alliance with the Salvadorans
against the Mexicans.

09:13.571 --> 09:16.199
They're still tight.
You know where he unloads the tar?

09:16.307 --> 09:19.401
Four months, no clue.
Slips us every time we get close.

09:19.510 --> 09:21.705
So we use my people
to bust the garage...

09:21.812 --> 09:24.906
convince Spider to share
where he takes the drugs...

09:25.015 --> 09:26.915
work up the chain from there.

09:27.017 --> 09:29.713
I'll have some unis round up
Spider's family for leverage.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.879
It's a good bet
most of them are illegals.

09:31.989 --> 09:34.958
So we're clear, this is my op.
You screw it up-

09:35.059 --> 09:37.755
Wouldn't do that to you.

09:37.862 --> 09:40.888
Antwon was some
Iraqi National Guard general...

09:40.998 --> 09:43.990
we'd wait till he was all tucked in bed,
having a real nice dream...

09:44.101 --> 09:46.001
and then cluster-bomb his ass.

09:46.103 --> 09:48.264
Worst thing we could do
is take a straight shot.

09:48.372 --> 09:50.738
Not till we know where
he's keeping that girl's body.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.832
No, we gotta be patient.

09:54.778 --> 09:58.214
Captain's got something cookin'
with the D.E.A. Wants us all on it.

09:58.315 --> 10:00.249
Fed bullshit?
No, I think we'll pass.

10:00.351 --> 10:03.445
Captain's orders. You wanna skate,
you gotta talk to her yourself.

10:03.554 --> 10:05.852
Hey, Vic, your nanny is here.

10:11.095 --> 10:14.724
Cass? Everything okay?
You still feeling sick, kid?

10:14.832 --> 10:16.993
Ay, Mr. Vic.
I'm very sorry.

10:17.101 --> 10:19.934
My girl,
she's having a baby.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.005
- I thought that was next month.
- Baby come early.

10:22.106 --> 10:24.370
- Problems, I think. Do you understand, right?
- Sí. Sí.

10:24.475 --> 10:26.807
- ¿Sí? Thank you.
- It's okay.

10:26.911 --> 10:29.277
Come on, honey.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.780
- [Door Buzzes]
- Go ahead.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.782
- Sorry, Dad.
- /t's okay, sweetie.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.284
/t's not your fault.

10:36.387 --> 10:38.582
- Who's this?
- Cassidy.

10:38.689 --> 10:40.782
She's feeling
a little under the weather.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.791
This is my boss,
Captain Rawling.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.520
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

10:44.628 --> 10:47.927
Why don't you take her home?

10:48.032 --> 10:50.694
- I'll have Shane take the lead on Spider.
- Oh, no, no, no.

10:50.801 --> 10:54.032
Uh, I got it covered.
I just have to call my backup sitter.

10:54.138 --> 10:57.266
Your dad is very dedicated.

10:57.408 --> 11:00.377
Why you lettin' that bald cracker-ass
run my boys off their corners...

11:00.477 --> 11:02.877
with this injunction shit, huh?

11:02.980 --> 11:05.540
They ain't hardly earnin'.

11:05.649 --> 11:08.140
I can only wrap my arms
around so much.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.743
The injunctions
are comin'from the top.

11:10.854 --> 11:13.789
Maybe a, uh-a brick
of China white will ease the pain.

11:13.891 --> 11:16.416
Fresh from your Asian friends.

11:16.527 --> 11:19.894
/ don't touch the stuff.

11:19.997 --> 11:24.058
There's somethin'else. An El Salvadoran
named Spider showed up on the radar.

11:24.168 --> 11:26.796
So you got business
with him, shut it down.

11:26.904 --> 11:30.704
Cat named Verdice
may show up on the same radar.

11:30.808 --> 11:33.174
Make sure you shut that down.

11:34.411 --> 11:37.039
- Yeah.
- Pick up your trash.

11:44.822 --> 11:46.722
- [Cell Phone Rings]
- Yeah?

11:46.824 --> 11:49.554
- [Shane On Phone] Hey, it's me.
- Where the hell have you been?

11:49.660 --> 11:52.185
- Checkin'out Spider's casita.
- For the last halfhour?

11:52.296 --> 11:54.196
- It takes as long as it takes.
- All right.

11:54.298 --> 11:57.131
Well, Spider drove up
about 10 minutes ago.

11:57.234 --> 12:00.362
- Feel like doin' some work?
- Let's tear down the web then.

12:00.471 --> 12:02.666
Let's go.

12:07.511 --> 12:09.411
- Hey.
- Get down.

12:09.513 --> 12:12.073
- Drop the bag!
- Get down right now! Get down!

12:12.182 --> 12:14.616
- [Army Shouting In Spanish]
- Don't move!

12:14.718 --> 12:17.687
- Clear.
- [Ronnie] Clear.

12:17.788 --> 12:22.191
[Mackey] Whoo. Spider's sendin'more
than just cars back to the homeland.

12:22.292 --> 12:24.920
You get a shitload of tar with those.

12:25.029 --> 12:27.589
El Salvador, they got AK's up the ass,
all the guerillas.

12:27.698 --> 12:32.032
But handguns? They're like tight pussy-
rare and precious.

12:32.136 --> 12:35.867
All right, let's pop the trunks,
see what else we can find.

12:35.973 --> 12:38.737
Here.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.380
Nothin'!

12:48.619 --> 12:50.519
Hey!

12:54.158 --> 12:56.058
Wetback's got some greenbacks.

12:56.160 --> 12:59.061
Holy shit!

12:59.163 --> 13:01.063
How much you think that is?

13:01.165 --> 13:04.362
Hundred grand. More.

13:12.509 --> 13:14.568
Let's call it in.

13:21.151 --> 13:24.052
You know, you have to talk
to me eventually.

13:24.154 --> 13:28.022
Victim is Raine Powell. Worked
down the street at Electronics Emporium.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.992
- What's this?
- Just what it looks like.

13:32.396 --> 13:35.160
Wasn't us. Talk to him.

13:35.265 --> 13:38.598
I knew you'd want to see where
the body was, so I drew it for you.

13:38.702 --> 13:40.932
Where the body was?
You moved her?

13:41.038 --> 13:43.836
Yeah, the way people come speedin'
through here, she would've been a pancake.

13:43.941 --> 13:45.932
Did it ever occur to you
to redirect traffic?

13:46.043 --> 13:48.409
Hey, I used up
half my kid's chalk.

13:48.512 --> 13:52.141
I don't need a "thank you,"
but how about you get up off my ass?

13:53.417 --> 13:55.510
And this is?

13:55.619 --> 13:58.144
Oh, / had to move
the pocketbook too.

14:01.859 --> 14:05.852
You were a big help
in the community meeting last week.

14:05.963 --> 14:07.191
I mean, a real asset.

14:07.297 --> 14:09.857
/ believed in what / was saying.

14:09.967 --> 14:11.764
Well, / hope you still do.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.404
I've heard things.

14:15.506 --> 14:19.875
Maybe some of the minority officers here
aren't so thrilled with my policies.

14:19.977 --> 14:21.877
Maybe you're one of them.

14:21.979 --> 14:24.846
Some people feel
like it all sounds good...

14:24.948 --> 14:28.213
but the reality out there
seems a little bit different.

14:28.318 --> 14:31.116
We're arresting bad guys,
just like always.

14:31.221 --> 14:35.157
The way seizures work,
everyone is guilty until proven innocent.

14:35.259 --> 14:39.025
If we take the wrong car, it's not like
people around here can afford a lawyer.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.393
Well, maybe you can do
something about that.

14:41.498 --> 14:45.400
Look into using seizure money
to start a legal fund.

14:48.839 --> 14:51.103
l-I guess so. Sure.

14:51.208 --> 14:53.108
/t's a work in progress.

14:53.210 --> 14:55.576
This policy isn't the usual Band-Aid.

14:55.679 --> 14:58.944
Your guys got a location
on Verdice's drug stash.

14:59.049 --> 15:00.083
Grab your partner.
Come with.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.107
Grab your partner.
Come with.

15:02.753 --> 15:05.017
Did Raine have any problems
that you know of?

15:05.122 --> 15:07.090
Man trouble?
Money trouble?

15:07.191 --> 15:10.126
- No, she was a good girl, you know.
- What about boyfriends?

15:10.227 --> 15:13.526
Just Bear. But he
wouldn't have done this.

15:13.630 --> 15:16.292
- So you saw Raine last night?
- / was overseeing a shipment.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.732
She was stuck behind
her computer screen, like always.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.668
Type "A" personality?
Familiar.

15:21.772 --> 15:25.435
I told her not to park down here,
but the girl was a stickler for the policy.

15:25.542 --> 15:28.841
- The policy?
- The rules say employees
can't park at the store lot.

15:28.946 --> 15:31.312
Raine's the only one
who ever listened.

15:31.415 --> 15:35.283
She lives with Cornelius Aimes,
a.k.a. Bear, over on Palmer.

15:35.385 --> 15:37.285
Check it out.

15:37.387 --> 15:39.617
See? You're, uh-
You're talking to me.

15:39.723 --> 15:43.853
To the extent necessary
to solve this case, yes.

15:43.994 --> 15:48.055
All right, Spider says he dropped off two keys
here last night to a guy named Verdice.

15:48.165 --> 15:51.134
Could have dogs and shooters,
so stay awake. Let's go.

15:54.838 --> 15:58.831
- They're in position.
- Go when ready.

16:01.745 --> 16:04.839
[Shouts, Grunts]

16:08.151 --> 16:10.051
[Man]
Clear.

16:10.153 --> 16:12.053
- Clear?
- Clear.

16:12.155 --> 16:14.919
[Chattering]

16:18.629 --> 16:20.620
Shit.

16:22.132 --> 16:24.191
You sold me on this.

16:24.301 --> 16:26.428
Spider gave us
the right location.

16:26.536 --> 16:28.731
This guy Verdice
got lucky, bailed.

16:28.839 --> 16:31.865
Bullshit. Somebody couldn't
keep their mouth shut...

16:31.975 --> 16:34.068
which is why we don't work
with people like you.

16:34.177 --> 16:36.873
No one here leaked anything.
We go back to Spider. We find-

16:36.980 --> 16:40.507
I'm not letting you
near my guy again.

16:43.854 --> 16:46.220
I need to borrow this asshole.

16:46.323 --> 16:48.655
- All right.
- Come here!

16:52.696 --> 16:56.598
You got about 30 seconds
to spill your guts.

16:56.700 --> 17:00.534
How tough are you gonna be when your little
brother's being hacked to pieces with a machete?

17:00.637 --> 17:02.468
I don't got no little brother, eh.

17:02.572 --> 17:05.905
Oh, that must be some otherJuan Emilio
I got back at the station.

17:06.009 --> 17:08.876
It's gonna be too bad when they
have to deport him down south.

17:08.979 --> 17:13.176
You got a lot of enemies. La Colonia
doesn't get him, the Mexicans will.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.342
Twenty seconds.

17:16.887 --> 17:20.253
Tar that comes to me,
I bring it here.

17:20.357 --> 17:23.326
Most of it Verdice gets
at the church.

17:23.426 --> 17:26.021
- The church?
- Verdice is a believer, man.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.893
Stuff comes in there.
He takes what he needs...

17:28.999 --> 17:32.298
keeps the rest safe...
with Jesus.

17:34.004 --> 17:36.905
/'m gonna have to scrap
the whole operation, pull my agent.

17:37.007 --> 17:39.908
A couple of months,
put in a new face-

17:40.010 --> 17:42.501
Where's my informant?

17:42.612 --> 17:46.207
Right here, sir. Thought
he might need to stretch his legs...

17:46.316 --> 17:48.284
before he took his ride.

17:52.556 --> 17:56.993
First Angie fell off our radar, and now
this guy clears out like he's been tipped off.

17:57.094 --> 18:00.996
After I give my word I'm not gonna screw
this up. What the hell's going on?

18:01.098 --> 18:04.226
Aw, maybe the wrong person
saw us nab Spider...

18:04.334 --> 18:06.234
spread the word.

18:06.336 --> 18:09.703
Doesn't explain Angie's disappearance.
These were both your operations.

18:09.806 --> 18:11.706
Both of them were successes.

18:11.808 --> 18:14.368
Verdice and the heroin
are still missing. So is Angie.

18:14.478 --> 18:17.038
Lem's out looking for her.
We can still salvage this one.

18:17.147 --> 18:19.240
Spider gave up
his One-niner contact.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.647
Do I want to know
how you managed that?

18:21.752 --> 18:24.243
We brought his family in
for leverage. I used it.

18:24.354 --> 18:28.450
Look, you ask me, they probably just
packed up. Cook houses move all the time.

18:30.861 --> 18:33.295
What did you get from Spider?

18:33.397 --> 18:38.357
The El Salvadorans are shipping
their drugs through a church on Avon.

18:38.468 --> 18:42.131
Verdice is a member. He has his guys
posin'as good, God-fearin'folk.

18:42.239 --> 18:44.503
- You're kidding me!
- Sounds like Spider sold you a load.

18:44.608 --> 18:48.169
He's not risking his family.
It's the real thing.

18:48.278 --> 18:50.678
I'll work on a warrant.

18:50.781 --> 18:54.148
Let's keep this contained.

18:54.251 --> 18:58.950
The three of us, Army, Ronnie.
That's it. Just the people we trust.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.683
All right.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.427
Yeah, that's good.
Here, take this.

19:15.772 --> 19:18.070
[Claudette]
Occurred to me to take that down.

19:18.175 --> 19:21.440
I see Vic's humor grows
more sophisticated by the day.

19:21.545 --> 19:25.538
Boyfriend wasn't home.
I grabbed Raine's diary.

19:25.649 --> 19:28.948
Seems there were bumps
along the relationship road.

19:29.052 --> 19:31.850
DetectiveJuarez in San Antonio
has got a different angle.

19:31.955 --> 19:34.082
He's been tracking murders
in the L.A. area.

19:34.191 --> 19:36.091
'Cause there aren't enough in Texas?

19:36.193 --> 19:38.753
'Cause their suspect relocated
to Farmington a month ago.

19:38.862 --> 19:40.989
Hey, exposed dick.
Thanks for the warning, Dutch-boy.

19:41.097 --> 19:45.158
Kleavon Gardner. Questioned
in four separate homicides.

19:45.268 --> 19:49.136
Suspected him on two murders
three days apart.

19:49.239 --> 19:52.367
- Then nothing for six months?
- Witnesses placed him at a couple of the
scenes...

19:52.476 --> 19:55.502
but detectives in San Antonio
weren't able to make anything stick.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.842
Well, what's the connection
to our body?

19:57.948 --> 20:01.008
All the victims are young
black women in public places.

20:01.117 --> 20:04.143
Raine was killed seven blocks
from where Kleavon's sister lives.

20:04.254 --> 20:06.119
Are we gonna be
like this from now on?

20:08.158 --> 20:11.423
Juarez tried to warn somebody
in this department a few weeks ago...

20:11.528 --> 20:13.758
that we had a thrill killer
on our hands.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.957
Uh, thrill killers need the juice.
They take chances.

20:16.066 --> 20:18.261
This guy's patient.
He's an opportunity killer.

20:18.368 --> 20:20.928
No wonder San Antonio P.D.
screwed it up.

20:21.037 --> 20:22.937
Get your profiles right, people.

20:23.039 --> 20:25.599
Whatever he is,
I'm going to introduce myself.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.973
Oh, what-
I'm not coming with?

20:31.081 --> 20:33.379
Stick to your true confessions.

20:35.519 --> 20:37.419
[Man]
Looks good.

20:37.521 --> 20:40.285
San Antonio Police
interviewed you 11 times.

20:40.390 --> 20:43.223
They got you killin'
everybody but Osama.

20:43.326 --> 20:47.023
What I don't get is why you?
They got no D.N.A. They got no prints.

20:47.130 --> 20:49.621
Any excuse to fry a brother.

20:49.733 --> 20:51.667
- Justice Texas style.
- You said it.

20:51.768 --> 20:54.236
He send you after me?

20:55.572 --> 20:58.666
Juarez.
Got a real hard-on.

20:58.775 --> 21:01.141
Why is that?

21:01.244 --> 21:05.078
Might've mentioned he don't know
how to screw his wife too well.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.048
[Chuckles]
Shouldn't have done that...

21:08.151 --> 21:10.210
but he just got me worked up.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.720
You get angry a lot, Kleavon?

21:12.822 --> 21:15.290
Nah, not more than usual.

21:15.392 --> 21:17.519
About how long is this gonna take?

21:17.627 --> 21:19.891
Twelve hours
was the limit in Texas.

21:24.734 --> 21:28.568
Where were you last night, Bear,
a little after midnight?

21:28.672 --> 21:32.472
Drivin'... around, collectin'
my nighttime thoughts.

21:32.576 --> 21:34.476
Nighttime thoughts?
About what?

21:34.578 --> 21:37.376
Life shit.
I think better at night.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.972
Found this in Raine's
underwear drawer.

21:41.084 --> 21:43.052
She mentions you.

21:43.153 --> 21:45.121
Man, she's gone.
Why do you wanna dig up-

21:45.221 --> 21:47.985
"Dear Diary: This job is just
a steppingstone. I'm going places.

21:48.091 --> 21:51.117
But /'m not sure Cornelius
is ready to go with me. '"

21:51.227 --> 21:53.559
Then she talks about you
and a girl named Janelle.

21:53.663 --> 21:55.631
Janelle's just some white chick.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.632
Raine find out about you two?

21:57.734 --> 22:01.135
Man, did you read where she talks about
the collage shit I did for her birthday?

22:01.237 --> 22:04.400
What kinda grown-ass man
does collages and kills his woman?

22:04.507 --> 22:07.442
- You read this?
- Man, I saw her put it away
like a hundred times.

22:07.544 --> 22:09.671
What was I supposed to do, brother?

22:09.779 --> 22:13.180
See, man,
/ knew this shit looked bad.

22:13.316 --> 22:15.216
Where were you last night?

22:15.318 --> 22:18.981
AtJanelle's.
But it wasn't like that.

22:19.089 --> 22:21.557
We were in the bed,
but the clothes were on.

22:21.658 --> 22:23.990
It was platonic.

22:24.094 --> 22:27.723
You were sleeping together,
but you weren't sleeping together?

22:27.831 --> 22:30.925
Yeah, there you go.

22:34.004 --> 22:36.837
Bless this child, Father...

22:36.940 --> 22:39.909
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.843
- I say Amen!
- [Congregation] Amen.

22:42.946 --> 22:45.915
[Organ]

22:49.686 --> 22:52.211
We thank you, Lord, for bringing
this child- [Continues, Indistinct]

22:52.322 --> 22:56.156
- Reverend, I'm Captain Rawling. I need a moment.
- Oh. All right.

22:56.259 --> 23:00.696
Must be some kind of problem,
they sendin' a captain.

23:00.797 --> 23:04.289
Well, we believe
a few of your members...

23:04.401 --> 23:07.131
are using this church
to import illegal drugs.

23:07.237 --> 23:10.468
- That's not possible.
- Well, I'm sure it's without your knowledge.

23:10.573 --> 23:12.632
Are these three boys here right now?

23:12.742 --> 23:16.234
Muncelle's car is in your lot, and he's
known to hang out with the other two.

23:16.346 --> 23:19.406
They were makin' sandwiches in the kitchen
about a half an hour ago.

23:19.516 --> 23:22.417
Those boys volunteer.
Their criminal days are in the past.

23:22.519 --> 23:25.420
They're tagged One-niners. Just being
here together is against the law.

23:25.522 --> 23:28.423
I know about those injunctions. You find
'em out on the street, they're all yours.

23:28.525 --> 23:30.584
But this here is a house of the Lord.

23:30.694 --> 23:34.755
We have a warrant on the way. We need to
talk to the boys, do a search of the premises.

23:34.864 --> 23:38.595
- We'll be very respectful.
- [Sighs]

23:38.702 --> 23:40.863
How do you think
it's going in there?

23:40.970 --> 23:44.098
I'm more worried about
what's going on over there.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.871
/ mean, they snag him
and he gets caught...

23:48.978 --> 23:51.139
I don't even wanna hear
what Antwon's gonna say.

23:51.247 --> 23:54.614
Damn it. Here he is now.
Verdice is walking right into an arrest.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.151
- Get outta here!
- [Horn Honks]

24:00.256 --> 24:03.248
- Get outta here.
- Shit!

24:03.359 --> 24:06.226
- That's Verdice's ride.
- You think he's coming for a pickup?

24:06.329 --> 24:09.162
Not coming for the wine.

24:09.265 --> 24:13.099
- [Ronnie] He's runnin
- Asshole's gonna try to split.

24:15.638 --> 24:18.471
Hey, what are you doing?

24:18.575 --> 24:21.738
Army! What the hell
are you doing?

24:21.845 --> 24:25.144
Get outta the car!
Get outta the car!

24:25.248 --> 24:27.512
[Horn Continues Honking]

24:27.617 --> 24:30.711
Come here. You talk, Antwon'll know.
You keep your mouth shut!

24:30.820 --> 24:33.186
- Maybe you'll get out of this alive.
- Hey, man, take it easy.

24:33.289 --> 24:35.917
- Let's go. Come on. Get up.
Hands behind your back.
- What the hell was that?

24:36.025 --> 24:39.119
Guy was gonna bail!

24:39.229 --> 24:41.993
Stay out of my church.

24:42.098 --> 24:44.259
[Shane]
Let's go. Get up.

24:46.102 --> 24:47.967
Reading the good parts?

24:48.071 --> 24:51.370
Looking for more clues.
/t's a real window into the mind.

24:51.474 --> 24:54.568
How are things going with
your Texas chainsaw murderer?

24:54.677 --> 24:57.942
He says he's a victim
of the good ol' boys network...

24:58.047 --> 24:59.981
but something's off about him.

25:00.083 --> 25:02.643
- Maybe you'll have a take.
- So we're back?

25:02.752 --> 25:07.849
No, but I can put up with you long enough
to put someone like this behind bars.

25:12.595 --> 25:16.122
I've been telling my partner
about how you were harassed in Texas.

25:16.232 --> 25:19.099
Can we get you something to drink?

25:19.202 --> 25:22.194
So you can stop me from going
to the can when my bladder fills up?

25:22.305 --> 25:24.205
- No, thanks.
- [Laughing]

25:24.307 --> 25:29.108
So, uh, witnesses spotting you near those
crime scenes was just dumb luck, huh?

25:29.212 --> 25:32.477
I just happened by.
No law against that.

25:32.582 --> 25:35.449
Why'd you leave
San Antonio, Kleavon?

25:35.552 --> 25:37.782
/ just got sick of the Alamo.

25:37.887 --> 25:41.618
Kind of feels like
we're wasting our time. His too.

25:41.724 --> 25:45.057
Probably got somewhere you need to be.
Job? Girlfriend?

25:45.161 --> 25:47.755
Like we established,
I'm new in town.

25:47.864 --> 25:51.231
[Dutch] Must have a lot of free time.
What do you like to do?

25:51.334 --> 25:53.302
People watch.

25:53.403 --> 25:56.429
Tell us where you were last night,
and we can end this now.

25:56.539 --> 25:59.906
- Oh, / was home.
- I know, but give us the rundown
of the whole night.

26:00.009 --> 26:04.537
So you can go over my statement
50 times tryin' to trip me up? No, thanks.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.241
A woman named Raine Powell
was murdered last night.

26:07.350 --> 26:09.443
Bludgeoned to death.

26:09.552 --> 26:12.851
Maybe you, uh, happened by
this crime scene too.

26:18.127 --> 26:20.027
Yeah, I didn't kill her.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.863
He didn't even blink
at those photos.

26:23.967 --> 26:26.299
Classic sociopathic nonreaction.

26:26.402 --> 26:29.337
I don't know. He seems pretty confident
we won't come up with something.

26:29.439 --> 26:32.704
- He's already gotten away with at least four others.
- What else we got?

26:32.809 --> 26:35.437
Raine's diary mentions
some beef with a coworker...

26:35.545 --> 26:37.445
a friend she lent
her bingo winnings to.

26:37.547 --> 26:39.447
I'll have the unis pick him up.

26:39.549 --> 26:42.848
Have to admit it felt good in there-
the two of us clicking.

26:45.321 --> 26:47.551
Dutch. Do you know where Vic is?

26:47.657 --> 26:50.285
- No. Why?
- He's got me watching his sick kid.

26:50.393 --> 26:53.487
- My shift ended, and the sitter never showed.
- Did you try his cell phone?

26:53.596 --> 26:55.894
- No answer.
- I know the mom. She works in Mission Cross.

26:55.999 --> 26:58.399
Uh, I can call her.

27:04.474 --> 27:07.443
- How's she doin'?
- Good. Thanks again.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.977
Um, you know, Vic had a uni
with her the whole time.

27:10.079 --> 27:12.047
It wasn't like he left her
totally alone.

27:12.148 --> 27:14.173
I can't believe he didn't call me.

27:14.284 --> 27:17.651
Divorce is tough.
Mine was a while ago.

27:17.754 --> 27:20.222
Anyway, thanks again.

27:21.891 --> 27:24.985
- It was really nice of you.
- You're welcome.

27:26.629 --> 27:29.860
Listen, um, do you
wanna have dinner sometime?

27:29.966 --> 27:32.059
- Dinner?
- Why not?

27:33.436 --> 27:37.873
Three kids, a job,
selling our house.

27:37.974 --> 27:40.442
- / don't have time.
- We'll work around your schedule.

27:40.543 --> 27:44.502
- I don't know. You work with Vic.
- We barely see each other.

27:44.614 --> 27:48.311
I tried it with a cop once.

27:48.418 --> 27:51.478
Vic and I could not be more different.

27:55.992 --> 27:57.516
[Sighs]

27:57.660 --> 28:01.528
Reverend, I have a signed search warrant.
You must open the door.

28:01.631 --> 28:03.826
This is a house of worship.

28:03.933 --> 28:06.424
There's an easier way to do this.

28:06.536 --> 28:09.232
- There are no drugs here!
- Except for the heroin.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.671
Reverend, I have
the legal right to come inside...

28:11.774 --> 28:13.674
use force if I have to.

28:13.776 --> 28:15.676
Neither of us wants that.

28:15.778 --> 28:18.144
Then let the Lord be your judge.

28:18.247 --> 28:20.147
We could pack it up,
come back tonight.

28:20.249 --> 28:22.376
Yeah, and give 'em time
to flush the tar.

28:22.485 --> 28:27.013
We already look like assholes. Go in now,
at least we have something to show for it.

28:27.123 --> 28:29.614
- You believe in your intel, right?
- Oh, yeah.

28:29.726 --> 28:33.093
Okay, people, let's go.

28:33.196 --> 28:35.494
You know who we're looking for.

28:35.598 --> 28:38.863
Remember that this is a church.
There are civilians inside.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.562
So do your jobs,
but use extra care.

28:41.671 --> 28:43.571
- Who's got the hawk?
- We do.

28:43.673 --> 28:45.573
Good. Four teams.
Two in the front.

28:45.675 --> 28:48.041
One in the side.
One in the back. Let's do it.

28:48.144 --> 28:52.205
Captain, I'm not
breaking down a church door.

28:52.315 --> 28:56.012
Well, just think of it as a drug warehouse,
because that's what it is today.

28:56.119 --> 28:58.314
We shouldn't be going in like this.

29:00.490 --> 29:02.458
Get in the back.
Both of you.

29:05.461 --> 29:08.453
What the hell are you doing?
You're knocking us out of this?

29:08.564 --> 29:11.397
All right, Reverend,
last chance. Open the door!

29:16.672 --> 29:18.572
Do it.

29:19.976 --> 29:22.570
Look upon this child-

29:22.678 --> 29:26.170
[Reverend]
The Lord is the stronghold of my life.

29:26.282 --> 29:28.910
Of whom, then,
should / go in dread?

29:29.018 --> 29:33.250
When evildoers close in
on me to devour me-

29:33.356 --> 29:36.848
- Hold it, Muncelle!
- My enemies themselves will stumble and fall.

29:36.959 --> 29:40.417
- Don't you move! Don't move!
- Are you all right?

29:40.530 --> 29:43.897
Sofer and Lowe got the other ones
comin'out the back.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.265
[Reverend]
My heart does not fear.

29:47.370 --> 29:52.398
Though wars are waged against me,
even then do / trust.

29:52.508 --> 29:55.602
[Church Bells Ringing]

29:58.381 --> 30:00.281
- Any drugs?
- [Julien] Nothin'here.

30:00.383 --> 30:02.647
Just a.38.

30:02.752 --> 30:06.415
We're gonna have to search
the whole church and everyone in it.

30:06.522 --> 30:09.514
Just... be gentle.

30:22.371 --> 30:26.034
Hey. Hey! All that
fast and furious shit?

30:26.142 --> 30:28.770
You're sendin' smoke signals
to Vic and the captain.

30:28.878 --> 30:30.903
What are they gonna do?
Reprimand me?

30:31.013 --> 30:33.345
Look, we gotta find
that heroin first...

30:33.449 --> 30:35.940
show him we're not
Antwon's butt buddies.

30:38.121 --> 30:41.318
I told you.
It's temporary.

30:43.192 --> 30:45.092
- Ow!
- You got something?

30:45.194 --> 30:47.890
Yeah, botulism.
But no residue.

30:47.997 --> 30:50.431
K-9 could do this in five minutes.

30:50.533 --> 30:52.433
Yeah, if they'd ever show up.

30:52.535 --> 30:55.402
Hey, just found a receipt
in the good reverend's office.

30:55.505 --> 30:58.269
The church candles are imported
from El Salvador.

31:00.576 --> 31:03.101
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31:26.536 --> 31:29.733
[Reverend]
Heaven help them.

31:36.512 --> 31:40.039
- Vic?
- Get these sinners baptized.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.879
- What's up?
- I got the toxies on Angie's mom.

31:42.985 --> 31:46.113
Levels indicate she had
over 500 bucks of heroin in her system.

31:46.222 --> 31:49.123
Jesus! Even a frat boy knows
not to shoot that much poison.

31:49.225 --> 31:52.786
Yeah, and this was a lifetime junkie who could
barely scrape enough together for a dime bag.

31:52.895 --> 31:55.125
Somebody made sure
she copped till she dropped.

31:55.231 --> 31:57.631
Well, I'm connecting the dots,
and all I'm seeing...

31:57.733 --> 32:00.133
is a picture of Shane
with Antwon Mitchell.

32:00.236 --> 32:02.466
Did Paula find you?
She was trying to call.

32:02.572 --> 32:05.234
Oh, shit. I had it on
silent for the bust.

32:05.341 --> 32:09.072
Something about Detective Wagenbach
taking your daughter to the hospital.

32:09.178 --> 32:11.408
We'll do this later.

32:14.817 --> 32:16.978
She was sick. You brought her
to a police station.

32:17.086 --> 32:20.112
Carmen dropped a bomb on me. Backup sitter
blew a tire. What was I supposed to do?

32:20.223 --> 32:22.123
- You should've called me.
- I had it under control.

32:22.225 --> 32:24.352
Obviously not, otherwise you wouldn't
have dumped her with a uni.

32:24.460 --> 32:27.258
Christ! The first time in seven months
there's been a problem.

32:27.363 --> 32:29.263
Come on, Cass. Let's go.

32:29.365 --> 32:32.266
Maybe / should stay with Mom.

32:32.368 --> 32:35.337
She's gotta work, sweetie.
Genine's waiting for us. Let's go.

32:35.438 --> 32:37.668
Go with your father.
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:39.842 --> 32:42.936
One-time thing. That's it.

32:43.079 --> 32:47.516
You were pretty broken up about
Raine earlier. How are you doing now?

32:47.617 --> 32:50.814
Ah, a bunch of us
from the store set up a shrine.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.787
- Teddy bears, flowers.
- That's nice.

32:53.889 --> 32:58.326
You know, your boss found those
order forms you've been changing.

33:02.498 --> 33:06.434
I sold a few DVD players,
a couple of XBoxes on the side.

33:06.535 --> 33:08.799
I was gonna tell you all about it.

33:08.904 --> 33:11.134
Did Raine know
about your enterprise?

33:11.240 --> 33:14.141
- No way.
- Really? /n her diary it says she confronted you.

33:14.243 --> 33:18.077
Said she was gonna go
to your manager. / know.

33:18.180 --> 33:21.081
You were gonna tell me all about it.

33:21.183 --> 33:24.516
When Raine confronted you,
what happened?

33:24.620 --> 33:27.180
You probably tried
to reason with her.

33:27.290 --> 33:31.351
Look, if it were up to me,
I'd pin this on a real killer...

33:31.460 --> 33:33.860
some asshole
who murders for fun.

33:33.963 --> 33:36.796
The problem is,
the unis eyeballed your car...

33:36.899 --> 33:38.890
with what looks to be blood inside.

33:39.001 --> 33:41.492
You didn't plan this.
Second-degree murder.

33:41.604 --> 33:45.631
You can get out one day,
but we need to know the truth.

33:47.610 --> 33:50.078
I offered her a cut.

33:50.179 --> 33:53.774
But she pulled the moral
high ground shit on you, didn't she?

33:55.217 --> 33:58.846
One thing I hate
is a self-righteous bitch.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.514
[Dutch]
Tell me about it.

34:01.624 --> 34:05.526
You did what you had to do.
She left you no choice.

34:13.502 --> 34:16.027
So much for San Antonio
eating our dust.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.936
- He's innocent.
- Of murdering Raine.

34:19.041 --> 34:23.409
Guy's still a stone-cold killer,
and he just pitched a tent in our backyard.

34:23.512 --> 34:25.980
Got a suspect and no victim.
That's new.

34:26.081 --> 34:28.880
This is when it bites
we don't live in a dictatorship.

34:28.984 --> 34:31.384
Put the guy in a hole
and forget about him.

34:31.487 --> 34:34.081
There's an impulse
I can understand.

34:34.190 --> 34:38.183
We can't turn Kleavon over to S./.S.
until he commits a crime in L.A.

34:38.293 --> 34:41.161
You know, I thought I hated
being on the D.A.'s shit list...

34:41.263 --> 34:44.630
but this is actually worse.

34:44.734 --> 34:48.101
l-I can't believe
you're still freezing me out.

34:50.272 --> 34:52.706
I can't believe you sold me out.

35:01.450 --> 35:03.475
Officer Lowe.

35:03.586 --> 35:08.216
I think you should stick
to desk duty the next few days.

35:08.324 --> 35:11.191
See if you could find your way
into what we're doing here.

35:11.293 --> 35:14.729
/f not, / understand.

35:14.830 --> 35:17.663
But you should consider
putting in for a transfer.

35:29.912 --> 35:32.437
I wasn't gonna
break into a church.

35:32.548 --> 35:34.573
There was heroin
in the holy candles.

35:34.683 --> 35:36.583
This time.

35:37.953 --> 35:40.922
[Mackey] Altar boys pin you
as the head honcho.

35:41.023 --> 35:46.393
We can't make a deal, you're eatin'
roadkill goulash over at Lompoc.

35:46.495 --> 35:48.395
[Scoffs]
Where my spoon then?

35:48.497 --> 35:51.955
/f you wanna be a barrio martyr,
that's fine with me.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.934
But why not serve up
Antwon instead?

35:55.037 --> 35:57.301
Antwon who?

35:59.141 --> 36:03.771
We can put you into relocation.
Keep you safe.

36:05.314 --> 36:07.544
[Lowers Voice]
Lone Ranger and Tonto...

36:07.650 --> 36:10.619
they hauled your ass outta that car,
what did they say to you?

36:12.188 --> 36:16.488
They told me get out the car
and put my hands on my head.

36:16.592 --> 36:19.823
And that's the last I'm sayin'.

36:26.302 --> 36:28.202
Dutch-boy! Hero of the hour.

36:28.304 --> 36:30.397
Your daughter was sick.
She wanted her mother.

36:30.506 --> 36:34.670
You can't take a joke, so you make me
look like a prick in front of my ex.

36:34.777 --> 36:38.543
I'm sure your ex doesn't need any help
from me seeing what kind of prick you are.

36:38.647 --> 36:41.172
I just saw Angie's mother's tox report.
Lem have any news on Angie?

36:41.283 --> 36:43.683
- I don't know.
- Well, find him.

36:43.786 --> 36:46.550
/ wanna hear what he's got.

36:53.762 --> 36:56.629
[Antwon] Used to be bad cops
was good business.

36:56.732 --> 37:00.600
But now I got a stash gone, a whole crew
locked up and sellers who can't sell.

37:00.703 --> 37:03.570
You wanna tell me how the world
got turned upside down on your watch?

37:03.672 --> 37:07.836
Seein' as how you were misusing a house
of the Lord, I'd say divine intervention.

37:09.612 --> 37:11.773
He must really hate you.

37:11.881 --> 37:14.042
Only reason
he talk to me like that-

37:14.149 --> 37:16.117
'cause he wants to see
y'all dead or in jail.

37:16.218 --> 37:18.277
Vic Mackey wants you gone.

37:18.387 --> 37:20.378
We're the only thing
standing in his way.

37:20.489 --> 37:22.548
You think I need your ass?
You're wrong!

37:22.658 --> 37:24.717
You think you don't?
You're wrong!

37:24.827 --> 37:27.660
Protecting you is a full-time gig.
Plus overtime.

37:27.763 --> 37:29.856
So you can either tell me
what you're into...

37:29.965 --> 37:31.956
or I can keep chasin' Vic's tail.

37:32.067 --> 37:34.228
Some days we'll catch it.
Some days we won't.

37:36.906 --> 37:38.806
I'll think about it.

37:40.809 --> 37:42.709
Yeah, you do that.

37:46.081 --> 37:47.981
[Army] Antwon's gonna drop
the body. You know it.

37:48.083 --> 37:51.678
- He's not that stupid.
- Him being stupid's not what I'm worried about.

37:51.787 --> 37:55.951
I didn't hear you complainin' about my
leadership skills when I was gettin' you blown.

37:56.058 --> 37:58.356
This isn't doin' favors
to get intel on bad guys.

37:58.460 --> 38:02.157
You got me takin' it up the ass from Antwon
Mitchell, ramming cars to keep us out of prison.

38:02.264 --> 38:04.357
I've dealt with guys
like this before.

38:04.466 --> 38:06.434
You or Mackey?

38:06.535 --> 38:09.368
Do you even have a clue
how we're getting out of this?

38:09.471 --> 38:11.371
Look, I'm getting us close.

38:11.473 --> 38:14.931
This guy thinks he can kill
this little girl right in front of us?

38:15.044 --> 38:17.945
We're gonna find that little girl.

38:18.047 --> 38:20.675
We're gonna give her a proper burial.

38:20.783 --> 38:24.844
And when the time is right, we're gonna
shove a stick of dynamite up his ass.

38:31.393 --> 38:34.089
[Monica] Dr. Alvin Bernard's
clinic has been providing...

38:34.196 --> 38:37.461
free prenatal care to Farmington's
poor for 21 years...

38:37.566 --> 38:41.798
which is why I'm so pleased now
to give you this check for $10,000.

38:41.904 --> 38:44.771
[Man]
/s that money from seizures?

38:44.873 --> 38:47.000
Part of my promise to give
a third of what we get...

38:47.109 --> 38:49.839
from asset forfeitures
back to the community.

38:49.945 --> 38:53.437
How does that community feel
about your decision to invade a church?

38:53.549 --> 38:55.983
I wouldn't characterize it
quite that way.

38:56.085 --> 39:00.146
We found 12 kilos of tar heroin inside
there. /'d say they're pretty damn happy.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.086
- Any plans to seize the church?
- No.

39:02.191 --> 39:04.091
/s the reverend under arrest?

39:04.193 --> 39:06.684
The only people under arrest
are known drug dealers...

39:06.795 --> 39:09.195
with affiliations
to Farmington One-niners.

39:09.298 --> 39:11.823
So you'd interrupt another baptism
to put away a gang member?

39:11.934 --> 39:14.027
I'd interrupt
my grandmother's funeral...

39:14.136 --> 39:18.038
if it meant taking dangerous narcotics
off the streets our children walk on.

39:18.140 --> 39:20.040
But don't tell that to my grandma...

39:20.142 --> 39:23.373
'cause she's still full
of piss and vinegar in Tarzana.

39:26.649 --> 39:29.243
Reporters were tough today.

39:29.351 --> 39:31.911
We keep storming churches,
they're gonna get tougher.

39:32.021 --> 39:34.080
- You were all for it earlier.
- I was.

39:34.189 --> 39:37.647
I am. It's just this thing
is too good to blow on-

39:37.760 --> 39:40.285
Hoda Stubbs was killed.
Angie too, I'm guessing.

39:40.396 --> 39:42.728
I plan on finding
the asshole who did it.

39:42.831 --> 39:45.823
When you do, ask about the leak
at the warehouse today.

39:45.934 --> 39:49.836
We don't know there was a leak, and even
if there was, we don't know they're related.

39:49.938 --> 39:53.066
- Could be accidental.
- Stop bullshitting me.

39:53.175 --> 39:55.905
You vouched for Shane.
What about Army?

39:56.011 --> 39:58.036
He seems like a good kid.
I don't think-

39:58.147 --> 40:01.048
/ don't care what you think.
What do you know?

40:01.150 --> 40:04.517
Is there some reason you don't
want to dig deeper on this?

40:04.620 --> 40:08.147
I'm not about witch hunts.
I've been on the other side of a few.

40:08.257 --> 40:10.157
I chose you for this job...

40:10.259 --> 40:12.750
because I needed somebody
as hungry as me to make it work.

40:12.861 --> 40:15.056
And I'm gettin' it done.
Why are you riding me?

40:15.164 --> 40:17.359
Because shit is falling
through the cracks.

40:17.466 --> 40:20.264
Pressure on the seizure program
is only gonna get more intense.

40:20.369 --> 40:23.099
And when it does, that shit
is gonna rise straight to the surface.

40:23.205 --> 40:28.006
/f you can't withstand scrutiny-
about anything-

40:28.110 --> 40:30.601
I need you to step aside.

40:32.815 --> 40:37.013
I don't step aside.
I step up.

40:38.687 --> 40:41.884
Which is the other reason
I chose you.

40:41.990 --> 40:44.356
Find the leak.

40:50.165 --> 40:52.656
- That's some cold-ass shit.
- You can't tell the Iraqi insurgents...

40:52.768 --> 40:55.430
- from the plain old Iraqi idiots.
- Yeah, and no difference here.

40:55.537 --> 40:58.199
- Somebody gets in the way, we keep rollin'.
- Oh, man.

40:58.307 --> 41:00.798
I'm just sayin', maybe that's the way
we gotta look at things.

41:00.909 --> 41:03.377
- What's up?
- You son of a bitch. What did you do?

41:03.479 --> 41:05.413
- She was 14!
- What the hell's your problem, man?

41:05.514 --> 41:08.449
You bring Angie to
Antwon Mitchell yourself? Huh?

41:08.550 --> 41:11.280
Hand her over with a goddamn bow?
Or just tell 'em where to find her?

41:11.386 --> 41:12.648
- No.
- No?

41:12.755 --> 41:15.087
- Where is she then?
- Back off! Just back off!

41:15.190 --> 41:19.126
- I got it, okay?
- Where is she then, Shane?

41:21.663 --> 41:24.860
- Where is Angie?
- What are you asking me for, man?

41:24.967 --> 41:27.561
- You tellin' me you're not
in bed with Antwon Mitchell?
- What?

41:27.669 --> 41:31.196
- You told him Angie gave up
that cul-de-sac bust!
- No! I would never do that.

41:31.306 --> 41:34.298
What happened to her, Shane?
What happened to her then?

41:34.409 --> 41:37.105
- l-I don't know.
- She was 14.

41:37.212 --> 41:39.203
She just wanted
to get her mom clean.

41:39.314 --> 41:42.215
- You tell me what you did!
- Nothing! Nothing!

41:42.317 --> 41:45.013
Look, you know that I would never-

41:45.120 --> 41:47.020
You know I would never hurt a kid.

41:47.122 --> 41:49.181
I got one of my own now, man.

41:49.291 --> 41:52.158
Yeah, I know you.
I know you're lyin'.

41:59.001 --> 42:01.834
I didn't kill that girl.

42:01.937 --> 42:04.531
And I didn't give
her name up to Antwon.

42:04.640 --> 42:07.040
So you just stay out of my face.

42:08.343 --> 42:10.675
I lose that one percent
of doubt I got...

42:10.779 --> 42:12.747
we'll be mixing it up again.

42:25.060 --> 42:27.255
Captain says she wants
to hear your opinion...

42:27.362 --> 42:29.489
but only hers is right.

42:29.598 --> 42:31.964
Agendas have a way
of creating tunnel vision.

42:32.067 --> 42:33.967
She said I could put in for a transfer.

42:34.069 --> 42:36.367
Sure. Stock the pond
with true believers.

42:36.471 --> 42:39.372
Make implied threats
to get rid of the ones who aren't.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.567
You don't think I should leave?

42:41.677 --> 42:44.237
I think if you wanted to,
you wouldn't have called me.

42:46.515 --> 42:50.417
I grew up in Farmington.
I don't want to see it torn more apart.

42:50.519 --> 42:53.511
What is it you want me to do, Julien?

42:53.622 --> 42:56.250
You've got power.

42:56.358 --> 42:58.451
Help us to stop her.

42:58.560 --> 43:02.052
Going after a police captain
is no walk in the park.

43:02.164 --> 43:04.223
I should know.

43:04.333 --> 43:08.793
There are other officers
of color that agree with me.

43:08.904 --> 43:12.840
- We wouldn't be alone.
- / remember the last time
you and / went down this path.

43:12.941 --> 43:17.037
Things got messy, and you
left me twisting in the wind.

43:17.145 --> 43:20.012
Not this time.

43:20.115 --> 43:22.413
Vic Mackey- He's got
a lot invested in this policy.

43:22.517 --> 43:25.918
He'll come after you.
Could dredge up the past.

43:26.021 --> 43:27.256
/ can handle it.
/ am a different man now.

43:27.256 --> 43:29.451
/ can handle it.
/ am a different man now.

43:36.632 --> 43:40.329
[Ronnie] Russian taxi king's expanded his
realm. Added three more cabs to the fleet.

43:40.435 --> 43:44.496
Alex the Conqueror. How many
cabs you got wired so far?

43:44.606 --> 43:48.474
Even dozen. Even managed
to get one in his personal ride.

43:48.577 --> 43:50.909
Sweet.

43:51.013 --> 43:53.243
[Curtis]
Yeah? What do you want?

43:53.348 --> 43:55.908
What the hell do you think
you're doin' goin' after Shane?

43:56.018 --> 43:57.918
He ran right back
and told you, huh?

43:58.020 --> 44:01.217
You got suspicions, fine. We all agreed
we'd keep 'em to ourselves.

44:01.323 --> 44:04.952
There's a 14-year-old girl rotting out there
someplace. Are you in on that too?

44:05.060 --> 44:07.722
- What?
- You keep sayin' you gotta keep Shane close.

44:07.829 --> 44:11.162
Well, maybe you gotta keep me far away
because you're back to business as usual...

44:11.266 --> 44:13.200
ridin' in Mitchell's pocket with Shane.

44:13.302 --> 44:16.271
I wanna bring down Antwon
and find that girl as much as you do.

44:16.371 --> 44:20.398
Really? Prove it. Let me back in.

44:28.183 --> 44:32.620
It's complicated.
You gotta do things my way.

44:32.721 --> 44:36.589
Oh, you mean I agree
to protect Shane, like always?

44:36.692 --> 44:39.593
Right? Right?

44:42.464 --> 44:46.127
We added another car
to the garage sting.

44:46.234 --> 44:49.431
Shane didn't tell me
you came after him.

44:49.538 --> 44:51.529
I saw it.

44:55.711 --> 45:00.239
Jesus Christ.
Lem's one crazy-ass white boy.

45:00.349 --> 45:02.579
You really used to be tight?

45:04.019 --> 45:05.919
[Shane]
Yeah.

45:07.622 --> 45:09.715
A lifetime ago.

45:12.160 --> 45:14.628
What does he know about us?

45:14.730 --> 45:18.962
Nothing. He's just guessing.
He can't prove anything.

45:19.067 --> 45:21.331
I'll handle him.

45:24.306 --> 45:27.173
Look, you're just
gonna have to trust me.

45:27.275 --> 45:29.368
I'm gonna handle all this shit.

45:36.451 --> 45:38.885
It's not about protecting
Shane anymore.

45:40.489 --> 45:42.389
It's about stopping him.

45:53.268 --> 45:55.133
