WEBVTT

00:20.438 --> 00:22.691
- Hey, morning.

00:25.443 --> 00:27.195
-You hungry?
-Hmm?

00:27.278 --> 00:29.656
You hungry?
You wanna get breakfast?

00:29.739 --> 00:32.617
No, I can't...

00:32.701 --> 00:34.410
I got work.

00:36.538 --> 00:38.372
Okay.

00:38.456 --> 00:40.333
Well, I think I'm just
gonna go home, then.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.501
'Cause, um...

00:42.586 --> 00:45.338
I got work, too,
so I should just go get ready.

00:47.423 --> 00:48.883
Okay.

00:56.641 --> 00:58.226
Hey, just a reminder,
my friends and I

00:58.309 --> 01:00.353
are doing that, like,
movie theme party thing tonight,

01:00.436 --> 01:01.646
if you wanna come my place or--

01:01.730 --> 01:03.732
Sounds stupid.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.401
Okay.

01:54.866 --> 01:55.909
-Oh.
-Oh, hey!

01:55.992 --> 01:57.160
Hey, Heidi.
Hi, Walt.

01:57.243 --> 01:58.369
You leavin' already?

01:58.452 --> 02:01.122
Yeah, Arya's all done,
so I get to go home.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.498
Well, you're lucky.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.669
Well, I'm bummed
my new favorite acting coach is leaving.

02:05.752 --> 02:07.503
- Aw. What?

02:07.586 --> 02:08.713
"New acting coach"? No.

02:08.797 --> 02:09.881
- Come on.
- No.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.050
It's true.
Thank you for the other day.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.969
I put myself out there,
and now I'm getting more scenes.

02:15.053 --> 02:16.930
- Hey, that was all you, seriously.

02:17.013 --> 02:18.264
-Congratulations. It's cool.
-You're up, Walt.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.808
Oh, shit.
They're calling me in, guys, sorry.

02:19.891 --> 02:21.309
- Okay.
- Wish me luck.

02:21.392 --> 02:24.520
-Good luck.
-Here I come!

02:24.603 --> 02:27.356
- Well...
- Yeah.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.441
Uh, do you gotta get in there too?

02:28.524 --> 02:30.860
-Oh, no, I'm not-- I'm not in that scene.
-Oh, okay.

02:30.944 --> 02:33.362
I'll let you get going
to whatever you gotta go do.

02:33.446 --> 02:34.447
Are you busy?

02:34.530 --> 02:36.741
Oh, no.
Why? Uh, what's up?

02:36.825 --> 02:41.788
Well, is there a teeny-tiny chance
maybe you could run some lines with me?

02:41.871 --> 02:44.123
Oh, uh... yeah, sure.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.084
Oh, and can you not put lotion
on my legs?

02:46.167 --> 02:48.127
I just don't like the way it feels.
Thanks.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.212
Ticklish?

02:49.295 --> 02:51.756
No, I'm not ticklish,
I just don't like it. Thank you.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.341
He still hasn't texted.

02:53.424 --> 02:54.926
-Who?
-Gus.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.219
Gus, that little bassist?

02:56.302 --> 02:58.763
We went on a date last night
to a magic show.

02:58.847 --> 03:00.932
It was fun,
but I think I might have fucked it up.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.726
-What happened?
-I don't know.

03:02.809 --> 03:05.519
I was rude without meaning to be.
He's so sweet.

03:05.603 --> 03:06.980
If he's sweet,
then what are you worried about?

03:07.063 --> 03:08.857
I'm not worried.
I just thought that was the benefit

03:08.940 --> 03:11.567
of having sex with a nice guy,
is he was nice to you.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.945
I mean, when I had had sex
with that asshole from Top Chef

03:14.028 --> 03:18.407
I didn't expect a call,
but I didn't expect mind games from Gus.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.080
"Do not resist us.

03:24.163 --> 03:26.040
You have evil inside you."

03:26.124 --> 03:29.585
The only evil force in here is you.

03:29.668 --> 03:33.965
"Stand back!
The ancient incantation cometh."

03:38.677 --> 03:40.930
Man-Wolf, I summon thee!

03:43.892 --> 03:46.477
Release me!

03:49.397 --> 03:50.398
And that's it.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.901
- Wow, that's amazing.

03:52.984 --> 03:54.027
You can just work up
tears like that, huh?

03:54.110 --> 03:55.694
-Oh, yeah, thank you.
-That's very impressive.

03:55.779 --> 03:58.031
Hey, uh, your elderly priest
was not so bad.

03:58.114 --> 03:59.908
- Oh! Thank you.

03:59.991 --> 04:03.702
Yeah, I went to Catholic school
so I was really just, uh, channeling...

04:03.787 --> 04:06.455
a Father Jerry there.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.584
Oh, you're so funny, Gus.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.046
-Oh, thank you.
-No, you are.

04:16.925 --> 04:19.177
Okay, well, you break a leg.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.553
-I'm sure you'll do great.
-Thank you.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.306
What are doing tonight?
Doing anything fun?

04:23.389 --> 04:25.599
Oh, yeah,
I'm just having some friends come over.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.185
-Oh, cool.
-We do this thing where we...

04:27.268 --> 04:30.604
we get together and we write theme songs
for movies that don't have one.

04:30.688 --> 04:33.566
That is too funny.

04:33.649 --> 04:36.110
Thanks, yeah, no, we...
Yeah, we have fun.

04:36.194 --> 04:38.529
It sounds like something
me and my friends in Toronto would do.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.365
Mmm-hmm. Uh, what about you?
What are you up to tonight?

04:41.449 --> 04:43.284
-Um, I got some stuff on the DVR.
-Mmm-hmm.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.411
So I'm gonna do that.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.747
I don't know, is it just me, or is it
kind of lonely here?

04:48.832 --> 04:50.749
I think I just miss my friends, probably.

04:50.834 --> 04:53.711
Well, you can come
to the thing tonight...

04:53.795 --> 04:55.671
-if you want to, or...
-Oh, I didn't mean to invite myself.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.548
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.926
-No. No, no, you didn't.
-I didn't meant to do that.

05:00.009 --> 05:02.303
That was just, uh...
No, it's totally cool.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.888
Are you sure?

05:03.972 --> 05:05.223
Definitely, yeah.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.433
Okay, cool.
I'll stop by after I'm done here.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.269
-All right.
-And if you need a vocalist, um...

05:10.353 --> 05:13.314
I did, uh, Singing with the Stars.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.523
What's that?

05:14.607 --> 05:17.401
It's like The Voice but for Canada.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.988
Oh, that's cool.
How'd you do?

05:21.072 --> 05:25.409
♪ I came in ninth ♪

05:25.493 --> 05:28.830
♪ Yeah ♪

05:28.913 --> 05:30.456
I'm kidding!

05:30.539 --> 05:32.375
Yeah. Hey.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.210
- No, don't clap for that. No.
- It's good.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.087
No, with a voice like that,
you should come in first.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.507
I, um...
I should have, yeah.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.050
-Yeah.
-I should have.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.678
-Okay. Great. All right.
-Okay. Have a good one.

05:44.762 --> 05:45.804
You, too.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.932
All right, bye.

05:52.728 --> 05:54.898
Yo, Gus.
Gus, Gus, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

05:54.981 --> 05:57.191
-Hey! What's up?
-Dude, dude, dude.

05:57.275 --> 05:58.902
What are you doing
coming out of Heidi's trailer?

05:58.985 --> 06:01.320
Nothing, we were just, like,
running lines and stuff.

06:01.404 --> 06:04.657
Dude, you're on a fucking roll right now.
Didn't you just bang a crazy blonde chick?

06:04.740 --> 06:07.826
No. Me and... I mean, I...

06:07.911 --> 06:09.996
banged Mickey, yeah.

06:10.079 --> 06:12.248
But, Heidi, no. We were just, like,
running lines in there.

06:12.331 --> 06:13.416
Nothing's going on between us.

06:13.499 --> 06:16.877
Just be careful, man. You can't go around
fucking the girls on the show.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.421
That's a full-time Cosby move.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.798
What?
No, but, that's different.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.758
Like, he was in a position of power.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.677
I'm, like, the least powerful person here.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.888
If anything, she's like Cosby-ing me
or something, you know.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.390
Listen, you don't even
have to explain it to me.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.268
I want to fuck all the girls on the set.
All of 'em. And their moms.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.228
-Oh.
-But I can't, Gus.

06:34.312 --> 06:36.397
I can't do it because
I'm a professional.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.608
Kevin, if I can be honest,
I feel a little judged by you right now.

06:39.692 --> 06:41.485
I feel like you're, like,
monitoring me, and, like...

06:41.569 --> 06:44.572
casting aspersions
when there should be no aspersions cast.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.783
-Listen, I'm just saying--
-I understand where you're coming from.

06:47.866 --> 06:52.371
If something was going on
between Heidi and I, yes, I would...

06:52.455 --> 06:54.123
It's good advice, okay?
It's good advice.

06:54.207 --> 06:55.333
I know it's good advice, man.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.501
I'm like that black guy in every movie

06:57.585 --> 06:59.878
that comes on and gives his white friend
perfect advice.

06:59.963 --> 07:01.255
-Hmm.
-But for some reason,

07:01.339 --> 07:03.257
every time I go out for those roles, man,
I never get 'em.

07:03.341 --> 07:05.801
Well, that's okay. I hate it
when that happens in movies anyway.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.511
Do you, really?
That's my favorite part.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.597
-Really? That's my least favorite part.
-You've Got Mail?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.224
Dave Chappelle was great
in You've Got Mail.

07:11.307 --> 07:12.516
That's true.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.229
He did hit the high watermark of...
dependable black friends.

07:17.396 --> 07:18.606
But you'd be great, man.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.024
-I know I would be great, man.
-Yeah.

07:20.108 --> 07:22.276
That's actually why I came out here.
To be great.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.528
Not hand out sandwiches, man.

07:25.738 --> 07:28.407
I wonder if you can get
breast cancer from these.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.034
If it'll just start.

07:30.118 --> 07:32.786
He mentioned this sing-along thing
he's doing tonight.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.288
-Who?
-Gus.

07:34.372 --> 07:35.456
Oh, we're still on this?

07:35.539 --> 07:37.458
You know what? Fuck it.
I'm just gonna show up.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.294
I'll go late. Everybody'll leave,
I'll sleep over and it'll all be good.

07:40.378 --> 07:42.338
You're just gonna, like,
crash his party?

07:42.421 --> 07:45.008
I'm not crashing.
He invited me twice.

07:48.052 --> 07:50.346
Hey, you're gonna clean those
before you use them again, right?

07:50.429 --> 07:52.098
-They're clean.
-That's bullshit!

07:52.181 --> 07:54.225
I've been sitting here this whole time.
They're not clean.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.851
It's steel. They self-clean.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.104
You used dirty tools
to give me a manicure?

07:58.187 --> 08:01.607
I could get gangrene from you!
I could lose a hand!

08:01.690 --> 08:04.443
Really?
You're all good?

08:04.527 --> 08:06.695
Yeah, I'm just having
a low blood sugar moment.

08:06.779 --> 08:11.825

08:39.937 --> 08:41.064
Can we do a ballad next time?

08:41.147 --> 08:43.524
I feel like my voice sounds
really good when we do ballads.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.109
Of course. Yeah.

08:45.193 --> 08:49.863
Also, could I have... When I sing ballads,
my voice sounds good like that, too.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.865
- Okay.
- Get your own thing, Ruby.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.409
Ballads are my thing.

09:06.089 --> 09:08.674
Hey, man, did you give this Heidi girl
the heads-up about tonight?

09:08.757 --> 09:10.301
Like, what?
What do you mean?

09:10.384 --> 09:13.096
I mean, this sort of party
isn't everybody's thing.

09:13.179 --> 09:15.473
I invited a girl to one of these
and we broke up after.

09:15.556 --> 09:18.016
I also threw up in her car
on the car ride home.

09:18.101 --> 09:19.643
That... was part of it.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.105
Our music nights
can be a lot to take in, man.

09:22.188 --> 09:23.564
That's fine.
I gave her a heads-up.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.567
She knows, like, this isn't, like...
the hottest ticket in town.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.194
So, it's fine.

09:28.277 --> 09:29.570
Where did you get that toaster?

09:30.321 --> 09:32.073
Oh, it came with, uh, the Springwood.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.324
-It did?
-Yeah.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.908
Yeah, you probably have one, too.

09:34.992 --> 09:37.035
No, I didn't get one.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.579
Your apartment came with a toaster?

09:38.662 --> 09:41.124
-Yeah.
-I had to go on fucking Amazon.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.417
This is fascinating.

09:43.501 --> 09:44.627
Yeah, you got ripped off.

09:53.386 --> 09:54.512
- Hey!
- Hey!

09:54.595 --> 09:56.347
- How's it goin'?
- Good. How are you?

09:56.430 --> 09:57.848
Good to see you.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.767
Yeah, you too.
I brought some snacks.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.311
-Thank you. Nice of you.
-Okay.

10:02.395 --> 10:05.314
Hi, guys,
I'm Heidi.

10:05.398 --> 10:07.275
Thanks for letting me crash this party.

10:07.358 --> 10:08.692
--Yeah. Hey.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.944
Yeah, everybody,
this is Heidi.

10:11.028 --> 10:15.408
Heidi, uh, that's Kyle,
we got Dean, Randy, Cori...

10:15.491 --> 10:16.659
Ah, you know, everybody.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.411
You roll deep!
I love it.

10:18.494 --> 10:19.578
Aw, yeah.

10:19.662 --> 10:23.707
Gus told me about, uh,
your singing-theme-song party.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.834
Oh, my God,
I'm, like... I flipped out.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.836
- So excited to be here. So excited.
- Yeah.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.422
So, what movie
are we doing tonight?

10:29.505 --> 10:32.090
Oh, uh, tonight, we're tackling,
uh, Carlito's Way.

10:32.175 --> 10:33.384
-Okay.
-Tonight. Yeah.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.887
Starring, uh, you might know him
as Albert Pacino.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.348
--Oh, and guys, we're in luck,

10:39.432 --> 10:42.476
because this one over here
has a beautiful voice.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.769
- Oh, stop.
- No--

10:43.852 --> 10:46.314
It's true. I know.
I know that you do.

10:46.397 --> 10:50.151
I know you were
on the Canadian Singing for the Stars,

10:50.234 --> 10:52.027
and you beat Bethany LeFleur, so...

10:52.110 --> 10:55.072
Oh, my gosh, thank you so much.
That's so sweet.

10:55.156 --> 10:56.490
I didn't know that they aired that here.

10:56.574 --> 10:57.866
No, they didn't. I was...

10:57.950 --> 10:59.785
I was in Canada with my cousin.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.954
We had poutine
and we watched the whole series...

11:02.037 --> 11:04.748
--...and I gained, like, five pounds.

11:13.591 --> 11:14.967
So you work with Gus on Witchita?

11:15.050 --> 11:17.345
-Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
-Yeah, Heidi's an actress on the show.

11:17.428 --> 11:19.930
-Oh.
-Ooh. You got any hot gossip?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.932
Yeah, Gus never tells us anything.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.101
Oh, what's the guy
who plays the mayor like?

11:24.184 --> 11:25.853
I feel like he's,
like, a dick in real life.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.438
He's just has, like, a dick vibe.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.065
Well, all I can say is
that the cast,

11:30.148 --> 11:33.611
like, when we're all on the set together,
it's like one big family.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.947
Um, and the guy that plays the mayor
is a huge perv.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.949

- You showed up.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.906
Yeah, well, you invited me.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.494
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...

13:46.577 --> 13:48.912
Hey, everybody,
this is, uh, my...

13:48.996 --> 13:50.373
friend, Mickey!

13:50.456 --> 13:54.502
And Mickey, this is, uh, Chris, and Kyle,
and... yeah, everybody.

13:54.585 --> 13:57.337
Uh, I hope it's okay that I came.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.757
Of course! Yes. Yeah.

13:59.840 --> 14:03.594
You wanna... You want something to drink,
or, uh, you want a snack, or...

14:03.677 --> 14:07.014
something to drink?
Or, I said that twice.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.599
Uh, you want two drinks?

14:08.682 --> 14:10.684
-I'll take a water.
-Okay, cool.

14:10.768 --> 14:15.523
Guys, I'm, like, loving these lyrics,
but I feel like it's missing harmony.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.315
So, uh, how you doing?

14:17.400 --> 14:19.610
Good. What's the deal?
I didn't hear from you all day?

14:19.693 --> 14:23.030
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I... I wasn't, uh...

14:23.113 --> 14:25.949
I hope you don't mind that I didn't
text you or call you or anything.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.118
Whatever. I mean,

14:28.201 --> 14:30.954
I'm sorry if at the Magic Castle
I was a little...

14:31.038 --> 14:35.000
Oh, no, no. I mean, that's not why
I didn't text you or anything.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.795
I just figured, you know,
we saw each other this morning,

14:37.878 --> 14:41.465
and I kind of figured
that was like our daily contact thing.

14:41.549 --> 14:43.551
Whatever.
It's not your job to text me.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.135
-No, yeah, right.
-Uh...

14:46.679 --> 14:48.681
You're sure it's not weird
that I'm here?

14:49.390 --> 14:51.767
Yeah... yeah, I'm glad you're here.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.061
Hey, you look really cute.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.480
Thank you.
You, too.

14:56.564 --> 14:58.732
I mean, obviously,
you're, like, so pretty.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.319
Come on, Gus,
we need more rhymes!

15:02.403 --> 15:04.196
Oh, okay. Well...

15:04.279 --> 15:06.907
I should probably get in there.
Um, wanna come?

15:06.990 --> 15:10.035
Um, gonna drink my water.
I'll be there in a minute.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.912
Let's have fun, okay?

15:11.995 --> 15:13.622
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15:22.548 --> 15:24.299
What comes next, Mom?

15:24.382 --> 15:28.220
Take the fork
and put it along the pastry, just so.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.346
- As if a crow...

15:29.430 --> 15:30.723
...were dancing along the crust.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.935
Oh, Mom, sorry.

15:35.018 --> 15:38.146
Something's come up with Mickey
and I have to say goodbye.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.773
Is everything okay?

15:39.857 --> 15:41.442
Definitely. Talk to you later?

15:41.525 --> 15:43.527
All right, sweetie.
Anytime, darling.

15:43.611 --> 15:44.945
-Okay, miss you, love you.
-Miss you--

15:45.028 --> 15:46.029
Bye. Bye.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.280
-Turn the stove off.
-All right.

15:48.824 --> 15:52.035
So, do you both edit reality TV shows?

15:52.119 --> 15:54.497
Yeah, that's right.
Kyle gave me my first job.

15:54.580 --> 15:57.249
Oh, cool.
So, do you, like, hate it or...

15:57.332 --> 16:01.504
No, if you're an editor,
reality TV is, like, so fun.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.047
Like, all those shows
come together in editing,

16:04.131 --> 16:06.383
so we're basically treated like gods.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.093
This is, like, their favorite thing
to talk about.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.178
- How reality TV is fake.

16:10.262 --> 16:13.974
No, we can, like, make things happen
that didn't actually happen in real life.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.101
Wait a minute.
No way! Is that true?

16:16.184 --> 16:18.812
Yeah, I mean,
we kind of do it all the time.

16:18.896 --> 16:21.857
That's so funny!
So, you're like, literally God.

16:21.940 --> 16:22.983
- Well...
- Uh-huh.

16:23.066 --> 16:26.487
Like, if someone said, "I love my mom
and I hate Osama Bin Laden,"

16:26.570 --> 16:29.072
I could edit them to say,
"I love Osama Bin Laden."

16:29.156 --> 16:31.534
Oh, my! That's terrible.

16:31.617 --> 16:34.995
Or, "I hate my mom,"
which isn't exactly a lie in my case.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.831
Sometimes I want to put a pillow
over her head and end her.

16:41.544 --> 16:42.878
Mickey.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.481
Okay, so, like, what rhymes--

17:03.566 --> 17:07.528
What's another word that rhymes with,
like, Carlito's Way?

17:07.611 --> 17:10.614
What about "Scar-lito's Way"?

17:10.698 --> 17:13.116
Yeah, that's good.
It can be like, uh...

17:13.200 --> 17:18.496
"Al Pacino once played a character
whose face had a Scar-lito's Way."

17:18.581 --> 17:20.958
--Uh, any others?

17:21.041 --> 17:23.376
What about "Fnar-lito's Way"?

17:24.211 --> 17:25.337
What's a fnar?

17:25.420 --> 17:27.380
I don't know, it just rhymes, right?

17:27.464 --> 17:29.049
Oh...

17:29.132 --> 17:31.301
Yeah, but, like, usually,
we like to do it, like...

17:31.384 --> 17:33.971
It's like a word that exists that rhymes.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.263
We like to use real words.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.015
But it... it might work. Like...

17:37.099 --> 17:38.851
♪ Fnar-lito's Way! ♪

17:38.934 --> 17:41.436
Wow. That's a trained voice.
You're not just born with that.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.230
Thank you.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.733
I went to, um,
musical theater camp in Ottawa,

17:45.816 --> 17:47.568
and it, honestly, changed my life.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.402
- Cool.
- Yeah.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.113
Okay, so, "Fnar-lito's Way."
That could work.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.657
Yeah, let's, uh, work with that.
So, um--

17:53.741 --> 17:55.367
I'm sorry, what is this, exactly?

17:55.450 --> 17:59.580
Oh, well, we, like, write theme songs
for, like, the closing credits of movies,

17:59.663 --> 18:02.791
for movies that don't have
closing credit theme songs, I guess.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.168
--But what's the point?

18:05.252 --> 18:08.255
-Uh, I don't know, just for fun.
-Yeah, it's just for fun.

18:08.338 --> 18:11.091
-Enjoy ourselves?
-We just like having a good time, I guess.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.384
It's for so much fun.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.720
- You guys are hilarious.

18:14.803 --> 18:17.765
We might try to put 'em up on, uh,
funnyordie.com one day.

18:17.848 --> 18:20.308
Oh, my God!
Funny or Die is so funny!

18:20.392 --> 18:21.644
Have you seen The Landlord?

18:21.727 --> 18:23.729
--So funny, right?

18:24.354 --> 18:27.232
So, it's like bad songs
about bad movies?

18:27.315 --> 18:29.735
No, no, it's...
The songs aren't bad.

18:29.818 --> 18:34.657
It's more like... okay songs
for movies that aren't anything.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.366
It's not like we're trying
to make fun of bad movies.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.869
It's not, like, one of those things.
It's just like...

18:38.952 --> 18:41.789
we try to write good songs
about any kind of movie.

18:41.872 --> 18:45.626
Something usually cool comes out of it
if everybody just, kinda...

18:45.709 --> 18:47.502
works together and comes up
with something, I don't know--

18:47.585 --> 18:49.046
No, I don't mean to...

18:49.129 --> 18:53.008
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be...
contrarian or difficult, or--

18:53.091 --> 18:54.592
I'll just shut up now.

18:55.510 --> 18:56.594
No...

19:02.851 --> 19:06.479
Uh, excuse me, sorry...
Okay.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.106
Uh, excuse me, sorry.

19:08.190 --> 19:12.152
Hi, um, do you know where E-2200s are?
I'm looking for Gus Cruikshank.

19:12.235 --> 19:15.530
Uh, I don't know, but there should be
a directory in the main building.

19:15.613 --> 19:16.949
So how do you know Gus?

19:17.032 --> 19:20.285
Oh, um, from Witchita.
I'm an actress on the show.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.747
An actress. Yeah, I had a feeling.
You got a real star quality.

19:23.831 --> 19:25.040
Oh, thank you!

19:25.123 --> 19:27.084
I've been acting
since I was, like, four, so...

19:27.167 --> 19:30.754
I just moved here, um,
a few months ago from Canada.

19:30.838 --> 19:34.507
-Oh, wow. Big change.
-Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know...

19:34.591 --> 19:37.803
it's not the friendliest city
in the world.

19:37.886 --> 19:41.098
As I'm sure you know, but, you know,
I bet it's gonna get better.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.349
Mmm, it doesn't always.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.976
People have a really hard time
dealing with it.

19:44.059 --> 19:47.270
Sitting in traffic all the time,
being lonely and lost.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.772
Car becomes your best friend.

19:50.107 --> 19:51.274
Oh, wow.

20:57.049 --> 20:59.885
I've been acting
since I was four.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.307
God.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.399
Hey.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.401
-Hey.
-Great party.

21:16.484 --> 21:19.446
-Heidi seems especially great.
-Yeah, I don't know.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.739
She, um...
She sort of glommed on to the party.

21:21.824 --> 21:23.658
Honestly, I didn't really expect her to...

21:25.160 --> 21:27.495
come.
She just kind of dropped in, so...

21:27.579 --> 21:30.082
She's so beautiful.

21:30.165 --> 21:32.750
I guess.
Yeah, I mean, she's pretty.

21:32.835 --> 21:34.752
I think as an actress,
it's kind of...

21:36.171 --> 21:37.547
tough for her.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.674
I think there's a lot of girls
who kind of look like her.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.676
So it's sort of hard to stand out
in the crowd, and...

21:41.759 --> 21:42.803
Hmm.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.138
...all that, you know.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.977
Okay, all right.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.228
What? What?

21:51.311 --> 21:53.480
There's people out there,
and I'm just like...

21:53.563 --> 21:55.523
if somebody came in, I'd feel weird.
I just feel weird.

21:55.607 --> 21:57.609
You're being so weird right now!

21:57.692 --> 21:59.236
You're being weird.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.528
What? What did I do?

22:00.612 --> 22:02.530
You... I don't know,
I ask you to come to this,

22:02.614 --> 22:05.158
you say no and then you just like,
show up out of nowhere.

22:05.242 --> 22:06.493
It's like, crazy.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.661
Whatever.
I'm gonna go smoke.

22:15.418 --> 22:16.794
Are you leaving?

22:16.879 --> 22:19.047
Um, going out to grab a smoke.

22:19.131 --> 22:22.384
Come back soon.
You're a natural percussionist.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.510
Oh, thanks.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.347
-Would you be naked?
-But that's a weird thing.

22:41.236 --> 22:42.445
- Hi.
- How's it going?

22:42.529 --> 22:44.322
-Hi.
-Oh, hi, hello.

22:45.323 --> 22:46.658
-Hey!
-Hi, Gus.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.660
Bertie, what's up?

22:48.743 --> 22:49.953
Is Mickey here?

22:50.662 --> 22:52.122
No, you didn't see her outside?

22:52.872 --> 22:53.957
No.

22:55.042 --> 22:56.751
Hey, I know you.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.254
You ran a focus group that I was in.

22:59.337 --> 23:02.925
Oh, my gosh! Yes! You made that very
astute observation about the deli meat.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.259
It's gross.

23:15.062 --> 23:16.771
-Later, buddy. I'll see you tomorrow.
-See you, dude.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.691
Oh, and nobody ate these,
so I'm just gonna bring 'em back.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.526
Okay. Yeah.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.154
Is this oak?
I think mine's balsa wood.

23:25.197 --> 23:26.198
-Later!
-Bye!

23:26.281 --> 23:27.324
Bye.

23:27.407 --> 23:30.160
It's Bertie. B-E-R-T-I-E.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.411
- Oh. Bertie...
- Bye, Gus!

23:31.494 --> 23:33.746
-Bye. Bye.
-See ya, Gus!

23:33.830 --> 23:35.873
Best party ever, man.
Love you.

23:35.958 --> 23:37.125
Love you, too.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.360
-I'm gonna take off.
-Oh, Heidi.

24:03.443 --> 24:06.071
You're still here?
I assumed you had slipped out.

24:06.154 --> 24:09.157
Oh, yeah, I was just in the...
in the bedroom getting my purse.

24:09.241 --> 24:10.658
I, like, lost track of time...

24:10.742 --> 24:13.328
- Oh, okay. Yeah.
- ...in there.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.288
Do you need, um, help cleaning up?

24:15.372 --> 24:16.581
No, no, no, it's okay.

24:16.664 --> 24:20.752
Actually, the, uh, Springwood provides
a housekeeper once a week, so...

24:20.835 --> 24:23.296
- Oh, fancy.
- Yes.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.422
It's very fancy.

24:24.506 --> 24:27.050
In fact, they have a business center
with, uh, two computers.

24:27.134 --> 24:28.718
-Oh, my God.
-If you can believe it. Yeah.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.346
- I...

24:31.429 --> 24:35.225
Thank you so much for inviting me.
It was so good to meet new people.

24:35.308 --> 24:38.353
Oh, of course.
Yeah, I feel like everybody really, uh...

24:42.815 --> 24:44.609
uh, liked you.

25:07.299 --> 25:10.510
- I'm a witch. This is witch sex.
- Sure.

25:10.593 --> 25:13.596
Gonna put a spell on your dick!
Uh-huh?

25:13.680 --> 25:15.390
Can you feel that spell?

25:15.473 --> 25:18.851
You got that magic wand up in me,
motherfucker.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.314
Is that what you wanted?
Uh-huh?

25:22.397 --> 25:23.731
That's what you wanted!
