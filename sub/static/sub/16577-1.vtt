04:53.259 --> 04:54.858
Don't come at me

04:54.860 --> 04:56.660
You are not the father.

13:08.894 --> 13:10.394

13:10.396 --> 13:13.397
One, never disrespect me

13:13.399 --> 13:16.467
Two, if I did move weight,
I'd only sell to Caucasians.

13:16.469 --> 13:19.436
I would never join the white devil
in the degradation of my people,

13:19.438 --> 13:20.971
but I would participate
in his profits

13:20.973 --> 13:22.439
by giving him a taste
of his own medicine.

13:22.441 --> 13:24.741
- Preach, dark chocolate!
- And three, Grover,

13:24.743 --> 13:26.243
you fools bring drugs to a party,

13:26.245 --> 13:29.680
I bet y'all end up lookin'
foolish by the end of the night.

13:32.718 --> 13:35.586
That's how I do!

13:35.588 --> 13:37.654
So you're not gonna help us out?

13:37.656 --> 13:39.389
You're my bro, G, and I love you.
