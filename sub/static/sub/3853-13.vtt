00:00.001 --> 00:01.412
[narrator]
previously on dark matter.

00:01.413 --> 00:02.824
You saw the scans.

00:02.825 --> 00:04.236
Yeah and they said
you're flesh and blood.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.471
Artificially constructed.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.473
Welcome back, rebecca.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.678
[six]
we're gonna go get her.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.581
[five] i knew you weren't
serious about leaving her behin.

00:15.583 --> 00:22.454
[saw buzzing]

00:22.456 --> 00:24.623
Do they know what she is?

00:24.625 --> 00:25.691
Yes.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.626
Then they'll need to die too, a.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.461
All of them.

00:29.463 --> 00:38.137
¶

00:38.139 --> 00:39.772
[two old recording]
so?

00:39.774 --> 00:41.240
[four old recording]
you were right.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.276
[two old recording]
then we're agreed?

00:44.278 --> 00:46.712
[four old recording]
yes.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.048
[two old recording]
he has to die.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.050
[four old recording]
when?

00:51.052 --> 00:53.152
[two old recording]
before we get to the mining col,

00:53.154 --> 00:55.187
After we come out of stasis.

00:58.559 --> 01:03.362
[five] hey, android, there's sog
i need to talk... To you about..

01:05.533 --> 01:19.111
¶

01:19.113 --> 01:20.212
[five]
hey.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.416
Hey!

01:24.418 --> 01:26.535
Hey, help!

01:26.536 --> 01:28.653
Somebody help!
Somebody help!

01:28.656 --> 01:29.855
Help!

01:30.791 --> 01:32.291
[two]
what's the matter?

01:32.293 --> 01:34.226
The android's offline.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.167
Her neural chip's
been removed.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.103
There's something
in her hand.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.207
Volkov-rusi.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.442
The soldiers
who took the ship.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.344
We didn't get them all.

01:52.346 --> 02:06.758
¶

02:06.760 --> 02:08.427
[three]
son-of-a-bitch.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.562
No one messes with my robot.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.564
Whoever took her down
removed her neural implant.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.567
We're gonna to need to recover t
to bring her back online.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.836
[four] assuming it already
hasn't been destroyed.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.371
I don't think so.

02:19.372 --> 02:20.905
With the implant you
could do a full reboot

02:20.908 --> 02:22.875
To make her more manageable.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.910
Control the android
and you control the ship.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.246
So why didn't whoever
it was do it already?

02:27.248 --> 02:27.880
Why wait?

02:27.882 --> 02:28.898
[two]
i don't know.

02:28.899 --> 02:29.915
Maybe they weren't
thinking straight,

02:29.917 --> 02:31.383
Or five scared them off,

02:31.385 --> 02:33.919
Or maybe they have
some other agenda.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.621
[one] but how
is this possible?

02:35.623 --> 02:37.689
We did a full top
to bottom sweep.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.192
[six] obviously we need
to do a better one this time.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.727
Right.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.261
But remember,
we need to keep them alive.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.697
[three] at least until
we get the implant back.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.437
You know how to use it.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.206
Yeah.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.308
One, you're with four.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.576
Five, you're with six.

02:57.578 --> 02:58.944
Three, you're with me.

02:58.946 --> 03:02.347
Keep your eyes on your
partner and stay in touch.

03:02.349 --> 03:12.457
¶

03:12.459 --> 03:18.964
¶

03:18.966 --> 03:22.434
[three] you know i'm kinda surpd
you didn't partner up with your.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.769
You two having issues?

03:23.771 --> 03:26.605
[two] no, not that it's
any of your business.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.807
Sweetheart, on this ship,

03:28.809 --> 03:30.509
Everything is
everyone's business.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.394
Outside of
our quarters,

03:32.395 --> 03:34.278
He's just another
member of this crew.

03:34.281 --> 03:38.283
Yeah, i remember the drill.

03:38.285 --> 03:39.851
I wanted to ask
you something.

03:39.853 --> 03:40.852
Yeah?

03:40.854 --> 03:41.954
When i was in that airlock

03:41.956 --> 03:43.355
And they were
threatening to space me,

03:43.357 --> 03:46.491
You were the one
who gave up the code.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.227
So?

03:48.229 --> 03:50.329
Even though
i told you not to.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.737
Is this where you give me
the gears for disobeying an ord?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.340
That's not at all
what i was trying to say.

04:01.342 --> 04:04.543
You're the most convenient
choice to command this ship.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.912
Don't let it go
to your head.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.249
Actually, i was
trying to thank you.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.283
Oh.

04:11.285 --> 04:14.019
Until you ruined it.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.787
Well you're welcome.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.423
Clear.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.858
So why'd you do it?

04:19.860 --> 04:20.859
Hmm?

04:20.861 --> 04:22.694
Why did you do it?

04:22.696 --> 04:25.631
I don't know.

04:25.633 --> 04:32.304
I guess i just figured
you're a valuable asset is all.

04:32.306 --> 04:37.276
Anyway, you're worth much more
than the payoff from one job.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.646
So it was a calculated decision
based strictly on logic?

04:40.648 --> 04:42.681
That sounds like me, right?

04:46.353 --> 04:47.386
Sure.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.518
[one]
just to be clear,

05:02.519 --> 05:04.603
We're trying to take whoever
did this alive, remember?

05:04.605 --> 05:06.705
[four] you doubting
my self control?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.207
I'm disciplined.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.708
I only kill when necessary.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.010
Yeah like your old friend?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.345
Akita?

05:13.347 --> 05:13.912
He was a threat.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.047
[entry pad beeps]

05:15.049 --> 05:16.315
[doors open]

05:16.317 --> 05:18.650
Oh yeah?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.986
He would have come
after me eventually.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.587
A dead enemy is
one less concern.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.755
[entry pad beeps]

05:23.757 --> 05:25.691
[doors close]

05:26.060 --> 05:28.493
I don't know.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.362
Enemy or not,
the lives i've taken

05:30.364 --> 05:32.064
Weigh pretty heavily on me.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.533
Yeah, well i can't
allow them to affect me,

05:34.535 --> 05:37.502
Because i have so
many more to take.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.842
[one] we're less than a week out
from the edge of colonized spac,

05:43.844 --> 05:46.545
Out of the reach of
the galactic authority.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.781
We can afford to stop running.

05:49.783 --> 05:53.452
[four] look, unlike you,
i'm not trying to escape my pas.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.087
I've chosen to embrace it.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.621
[entry pad beeps]

05:56.623 --> 05:58.557
[doors open]

06:02.096 --> 06:04.896
So once i've gathered all
the necessary resources,

06:04.898 --> 06:08.367
I'll return to zairon
and retake my throne.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.869
[two] one, come in.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.070
[two] what's your status?

06:12.072 --> 06:15.006
[one]
yeah, we just cleared this sect.

06:15.609 --> 06:25.717

06:25.719 --> 06:35.727

06:35.729 --> 06:42.768
¶

06:42.770 --> 06:44.169
[five]
what?

06:44.605 --> 06:47.873
[six] you look pretty
comfortable with that gun.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.108
Four's been teaching
me self-defense.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.578
That includes fighting
and weapon training.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.931
Now, when there's trouble,

06:55.932 --> 06:57.849
Instead of hiding
i can finally be useful.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.985
You've never needed
a gun to be useful.

07:02.055 --> 07:06.525
You might not want to hear it,
but i'm happy now.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.461
I finally feel like
i'm part of the team

07:09.463 --> 07:12.431
And it's got nothing
to do with this gun.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.065
Well here's the irony.

07:14.668 --> 07:18.103
All this time you've been
trying to be more like us,

07:18.105 --> 07:21.072
We've actually been
trying to be more like you.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.510
And we failed.

07:25.512 --> 07:31.516
In the end, we can't
help but be who we are.

07:31.518 --> 07:32.684
That's not true.

07:32.686 --> 07:36.221
When we woke up we were
just a group of strangers.

07:36.223 --> 07:40.158
But now... We're a family.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.795
[two]
six, how're you two doing?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.530
[six]
all clear here too.

07:45.532 --> 07:46.498
[two]
okay.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.899
Fall back to the bridge.

07:51.738 --> 07:54.506
[four] could it be that
there are parts of this ship

07:54.508 --> 07:56.141
That we have yet
to discover?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.676
I was considering the possibili.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.178
But we haven't
finished searching.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.980
What're you talking about?

08:01.982 --> 08:03.215
We've looked everywhere.

08:03.217 --> 08:05.517
No we haven't.

08:05.519 --> 08:16.027
¶

08:16.029 --> 08:19.564
[six] you got guts,
i'll give you that.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.099
[five]
i know these vents.

08:21.101 --> 08:24.035
If there's someone in here,
i'll find them.

08:31.879 --> 08:32.944
[five]
ready.

through this level by level.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.159
The others are all
stationed at choke points,

08:48.161 --> 08:51.162

there if you run into any troub.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.348

if you encounter anyone,

08:53.349 --> 08:55.533
I don't want you to take
any chances, you understand?

yeah, i see her.

great.

I'm coming down.

someone's in there?

what?

Wexler used to take down
the android and now it's gone.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.282
We're the only ones
with the code to this room.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.986
There's no one else
onboard this ship.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.855
It was one of us.

12:36.857 --> 12:41.860
¶

12:46.500 --> 12:48.533
[one] you sure that's
where we put it?

12:48.535 --> 12:50.068
[two] the device
was there yesterday.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.804
Why would one of us
target the android?

12:52.806 --> 12:54.172
Because she poses
the greatest threat.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.041
With her out of the way,

12:56.042 --> 12:57.909
It's a whole lot easier to
take the rest of us down.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.044
[one]
take us down? Why?

13:00.046 --> 13:03.281
[four] to finish what was startd
the day our memories were wiped.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.416

why now?

13:04.417 --> 13:05.550

i don't know.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.487
But we've got to
figure this out, fast.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.089
[two]
there is one way.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.358
[two] we're two days out
from the nearest space station.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.126
We get there,
get a new implant,

13:15.128 --> 13:16.828
And bring the
android back online.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.463
[five] and have another
lie detector session.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.399
[one] no, whoever did this is nt
gonna wait another two days.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.168
[four]
of course not.

13:23.169 --> 13:24.936

made before then.

where are you going?

i'll be training.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.274
[six]
we should stick together.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.376
Separated, we're easier targets.

13:32.813 --> 13:36.981
[four] i'd welcome anyone
who considered me an easy targe.

13:39.019 --> 13:42.020
[three chuckles]

13:42.022 --> 13:43.988
What'd you think
we were gonna do?

13:43.990 --> 13:46.558
We're gonna bunk
together, all six of us?

13:46.560 --> 13:47.458
[three]
nah, man.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.993
I say he's right.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.329
I say bring it on.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.833
Speaking of which,
can we take a little walk?

13:54.835 --> 13:56.901
Got something to discuss.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.372
Sure.

14:04.544 --> 14:09.981
[one] remember, we don't
know who to trust, so be carefu.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.549
[three]
i will!

14:15.555 --> 14:17.055
[three]
question--

14:17.924 --> 14:21.559
How attached are
you to that guy?

14:21.561 --> 14:23.061
I just want to know what kind
of blowback i'm gonna get

14:23.063 --> 14:25.330
When we leave him at
the next space station.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.599
[two] you've got him
all figured out now, don't you?

14:27.601 --> 14:29.100
Had him figured
out weeks ago.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.869
He lied to get
onboard this ship.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.604
God knows why;
or who he really even is.

14:32.606 --> 14:34.138
I know why
and who he really is.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.607
He told me.

14:35.609 --> 14:37.108
Is that something you thought
you might wanna share

14:37.110 --> 14:38.409
With me and
the rest of the crew?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.578
It's nothing the rest of
the crew has to worry about.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.379
Oh, okay.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.580
Good to know.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.715
Or not.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.849
And it's nothing that
would motivate him

14:44.850 --> 14:45.983
To take down our android.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.786
As far as you know.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.587
That would apply to
everyone else on this ship.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.357
Sure, but you're not sleeping
with everyone else on this ship.

14:52.359 --> 14:57.061
Are you suggesting my ability to
lead has somehow been comprised?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.001
Four's right.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.069
Whatever one's got planned,
he's gonna do it before

15:05.071 --> 15:07.672
We get to the station,
so what i am suggesting

15:07.674 --> 15:10.642
Is that we lock him up
until we get there.

15:10.644 --> 15:13.378
Better yet, why don't
i put you all in lockdown,

15:13.380 --> 15:15.380
Just to be on
the safe side?

15:15.382 --> 15:18.516
Problem with that is then you'd
have total control of the ship.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.385
I thought it was him
you didn't trust?

15:20.387 --> 15:22.553
Nah, it's just him
i trust the least.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.527
[two] i'll take your request
under advisement.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.462
[three] yeah well
don't take too long!

15:31.464 --> 15:33.598
Cause if you don't do
something about him,

15:33.600 --> 15:36.034
I sure as hell will.

15:37.671 --> 15:44.075
[heavy breathing]

15:44.077 --> 15:45.610
[four]
a rare visit from you.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.512
Should i be worried?

15:50.116 --> 15:54.252
[one] yes, you should be,
but not about me.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.521
I've been raising
the alarm about three

15:56.523 --> 15:59.490
From the very beginning.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.093
That you have.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.661
Come on.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.631
You've displayed some
pretty remarkable intuition.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.566
What do your instincts tell you?

16:08.568 --> 16:11.402
To trust no one,
least of all someone who snuck

16:11.404 --> 16:14.472
Aboard this ship under
false pretenses.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.278
I'm not like the rest of you.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.479
Clearly.

16:21.481 --> 16:25.016
When we used the transfer pods
to go looking for six,

16:25.018 --> 16:29.420
I ran a genetic scan
and found out the truth.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.490
My real name is derrick moss.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.659
I was a business man,
and by all accounts

16:34.661 --> 16:39.630
Leading a privileged life,
until my wife was murdered.

16:39.632 --> 16:43.234
By a member of this crew.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.203
Care to guess which one?

16:45.205 --> 16:47.438
So it's revenge you're after.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.042
I thought so.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.112
Now, i don't know.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.750
I had a chance to
kill him, and i didn't.

16:58.752 --> 17:01.552
I'm sure another opportunity
will present itself.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.254
I'm not looking for payback.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.557
I just want to keep us safe,
and the only way of doing that

17:06.559 --> 17:09.093
Is by making sure
he's no longer a threat.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.561
I'm not saying we kill him.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.297
Just neutralize him.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.032
Lock him up until we
get to the space station

17:14.034 --> 17:15.366
So he can't hurt anyone.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.634
There's one more crew member

17:16.636 --> 17:19.670
You'll have to get onside
for that to happen.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.706
I know.

17:21.708 --> 17:27.678
If she agrees, will we be able
to count on your support?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.753
[five]
you should be careful.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.423
She'll probably come after you .

17:38.425 --> 17:40.658
You or four.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.193
[six]
she?

17:42.194 --> 17:43.727
[five] one and three will be toy
worrying about each other.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.762
She'll count on that.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.564
And i'm not a threat to her.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.200
So you need to be careful.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.201
You're talking about two.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.836
We don't know what happened to r

17:51.838 --> 17:53.638
While she was down on that plan.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.440
Come on.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.607
You really think she's capable

17:56.609 --> 17:59.744
Of harming a member of this cre?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.449
I know she is.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.571
I've been thinking...

18:26.573 --> 18:28.573
We should lock
up the weapons.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.558
[three]
that's not gonna happen.

18:30.559 --> 18:32.542
[two] just as a precaution,
until we get to the space statin

18:32.545 --> 18:34.212
And figure this all out.

18:34.213 --> 18:35.880
I think the android
should be our bigger concern.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.699
[five]
he's right.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.517
Whoever has her neural chip
can use her against us,

18:39.519 --> 18:41.719
And you remember what
happened the last time

18:41.721 --> 18:43.354
You guys faced
off against her?

18:43.356 --> 18:47.558
[three]
yeah, i remember alright.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.393
Okay.

18:49.395 --> 18:52.463
So let's say that we do agree
to lock up the android,

18:52.465 --> 18:54.232
One problem.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.367
Who holds the key?

18:56.369 --> 18:59.137
[one] i don't think it matters
because i'm guessing whoever dis

18:59.139 --> 19:01.739
Doesn't have the skill
set to reprogram her.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.442
[three] i wanna come over there
and demonstrate my skill set

19:04.444 --> 19:05.443
On you pretty boy. Huh?

19:05.445 --> 19:07.411
[two]
hey, hey that's enough.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.679
That's enough.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.421
No, thanks.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.457
[six]
like i said before,

19:19.458 --> 19:21.492
We should all stick
together, just to be safe.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.594
Huddle for protection like a
bunch of frightened animals?

19:23.596 --> 19:25.596
No thank you.

19:25.597 --> 19:27.597
But staying together makes
it harder to access the android

19:27.600 --> 19:29.500
And use her against us.

19:29.502 --> 19:34.172
I don't fear the android,
and i surely don't fear any of ,

19:34.174 --> 19:38.276
So if anyone in here is even
considering coming after me,

19:38.278 --> 19:40.945
I'd suggest you rethink y--

19:40.947 --> 19:41.913
[two]
you okay?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.686
What's happening to him?!

19:49.789 --> 19:58.262
¶

19:59.799 --> 20:02.600
[two] blood pressure, heart,
and respiratory rates are stead;

20:02.602 --> 20:04.302
Cerebral blood
flow is normal,

20:04.304 --> 20:06.637
But he's in an unresponsive sta.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.240
I'm assuming this isn't
something you just sleep off?

20:09.242 --> 20:10.441
It's impossible to say.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.276
I don't know what he ingested

20:12.278 --> 20:14.312
But my guess is it
was a rapid-onset,

20:14.314 --> 20:16.347
Ultra short-action barbiturate.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.815
Possibly a neurotoxin.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.617
[one] so our entire
water supply's been laced?

20:19.619 --> 20:22.587
We can't know for sure
until i run a full analysis.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.355
Until then, i'd advise
everyone to not

20:24.357 --> 20:27.558
Consume anything
that isn't sealed.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.927
A few minutes later,
we all would've joined him.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.629
[three]
not all of us.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.234
One of us didn't
take any water.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.802
One of us wasn't thirsty.

20:37.804 --> 20:41.806
Isn't that convenient.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.241
Oh, come on.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.675
If i wanted to drug you,
i would've taken a cup

20:44.677 --> 20:46.978
Like the rest of you so
you wouldn't suspect me.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.980
Unless, of course,
you thought that we wouldn't

20:48.982 --> 20:50.481
Be awake to suspect you.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.483
I'm smart enough not
to take that chance.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.135
And yet, you did.

20:54.136 --> 20:55.786
No, i didn't because
i didn't drug the water.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.299
[six]
alright, settle down.

20:57.300 --> 20:58.811
You're not gonna to
get anywhere arguing.

20:58.812 --> 21:00.323
[three] that's because you
guys aren't listening to me.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.859
[two] you're just throwing
around wild accusations.

21:01.861 --> 21:02.793
[three]
you want proof?

21:02.795 --> 21:04.528
Fine, let's get proof.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.530
Search his quarters.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.666
Guaranteed, that's where
we're gonna find the shock stic.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.969
[six] come on, who's stupid enoh
to hide that thing in their roo?

21:11.971 --> 21:13.504
I wanna search
his quarters too!

21:13.506 --> 21:14.672
[two]
fine.

21:14.674 --> 21:18.609
We'll search everyone's quarter.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.344
Great.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.551
I don't even know
what half of this stuff is.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.954
[five]
neither do i until i fix it.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.625
[six] all right,
are we done here?

21:34.627 --> 21:35.893
Yeah.

21:35.895 --> 21:46.604
¶

21:46.606 --> 21:48.539
[drawer opens]

21:52.578 --> 21:54.478
That's a little something i picp

21:54.480 --> 21:55.980
At the last space station...

21:57.450 --> 22:00.651
From a little something
i picked up at the last space s.

22:02.055 --> 22:04.989
[two]
uh-huh.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.724
Moving on.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.583
We done here?

22:40.560 --> 22:41.759
Okay, we're done.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.628
It's late; we're tired.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.013
Get some sleep.

22:46.014 --> 22:47.397
No one's gonna
keep an eye on him?

22:47.400 --> 22:48.733
Be my guest.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.678
[six]
night.

23:07.854 --> 23:08.652
[two]
all right.

23:08.654 --> 23:11.055
Rest up.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.457
I have a feeling tomorrow's
gonna be a really long day.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.626
You okay?

23:16.596 --> 23:19.697
Yeah.

23:19.699 --> 23:20.865
Goodnight.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.118
Goodnight.

23:24.119 --> 23:25.635
[five] you think you could you
stay in my quarters tonight?

23:25.638 --> 23:28.706
You can take the bed,
i'll sleep on the couch.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.107
I'll stay on the couch.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.078
Why does she scare you so bad?

23:38.751 --> 23:39.850
[two old recording]
so?

23:39.851 --> 23:40.950
[four old recording]
you were right.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.420
[two old recording]
then we're agreed?

23:42.422 --> 23:43.587
[four old recording]
yes.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.456
[two old recording]
he has to die.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.008
[four old recording]
when?

23:47.009 --> 23:48.559
[two old recording]
before we get to the mining col,

23:48.561 --> 23:50.728
After we come out of stasis.

23:50.730 --> 23:53.664
[six]
where'd you find this?

23:53.666 --> 23:55.633
In the mess,
underneath the table.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.701
She was planning
to kill one of you

23:57.703 --> 23:59.670
Before we got to
that mining planet.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.872
She's the dangerous one.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.042
Have you ever
checked your computer

24:05.044 --> 24:07.044
For hidden or
deleted files?

24:07.046 --> 24:08.546
Of course.

24:08.547 --> 24:10.047
That's one of
the first things i did.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.582
What did you find?

24:11.584 --> 24:14.652
A couple of corrupted files,
i couldn't read them.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.688
You don't need to read them.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.624
You just need to
check the time stamp.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.802
[three]
evening.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.003
Going somewhere?

24:33.005 --> 24:36.774
]one] yeah, i was
just going to the mess.

24:36.776 --> 24:37.808
[three]
great.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.109
I'll join you.

24:42.014 --> 24:45.049
[one] on second thought,
i think i'll turn in.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.884
[three]
suit yourself.

24:47.753 --> 24:53.624
But if you change your mind,
you know where i am.

24:53.626 --> 24:54.959
Right here.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.930

That's the program you wrote

No.

that was your intention.

it was crude.

Yes.

you were trying to hurt anyone.

Really?

38:22.550 --> 38:24.433
Because it looks
like you were about to.

38:25.337 --> 38:26.836
Lower your gun.

38:26.838 --> 38:30.807
You kill me now
or he kills me later.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.842
Not much of a choice.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.117
[two]
what are you doing?

38:40.118 --> 38:41.785
[five] stopping you
from hurting anyone else.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.353
[three]
seriously, kid.

38:43.355 --> 38:45.722
She's the one who poured
us the drugged water.

38:45.724 --> 38:48.792
She was the last one who saw
that shock stick in the vault.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.160
[three]
drop your gun.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.527
All this time we've
been wondering why

38:51.530 --> 38:53.563
Whoever did this hasn't
brought the android online

38:53.565 --> 38:55.031
And taken control of the ship.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.500
The answer's been
in front of us all along.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.703
There's only one person
wouldn't need to do that.

38:59.705 --> 39:02.739
Somebody who already knows
how to control the ship.

39:02.741 --> 39:05.675
[two] i'm not the only who
knows how to control this ship.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.845
No, but you're the only one
capable of overpowering six.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.848
Nobody overpowered six, he was
surprised by someone he trusted.

39:11.850 --> 39:16.853
No, because the truth is,
he didn't trust anyone.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.756
Except you.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.726
[five] all this started when
we rescued her from that facili.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.361
Something happened
to her down there.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.363
And when she came
back to the ship,

39:26.365 --> 39:28.631
The first thing she did
was attack our android.

39:28.633 --> 39:29.632
[two]
no.

39:29.633 --> 39:30.632
No. No!

39:30.635 --> 39:32.102
[five] if you two hadn't been
too busy suspecting each other,

39:32.104 --> 39:33.370
You might've seen it.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.772
But she played you both.

39:36.775 --> 39:37.741
[crash]

39:37.743 --> 39:40.076
[bang]

39:40.078 --> 39:41.878
[one]
what was that?

39:46.818 --> 39:47.734
[two]
we've just been docked.

39:47.735 --> 39:48.651
[two] we've got about 40 seconds
before they blow the airlock

39:48.653 --> 39:50.537
And they're inside.

39:50.538 --> 39:52.422
That buys us enough time
to get down into the cargo bay,

39:52.424 --> 39:54.791
Break out the big guns,
and hold this ship.

39:54.793 --> 39:57.827
But we have to trust each
other in order to do that.

39:57.829 --> 40:01.598
¶

40:01.600 --> 40:04.667
[doors slamming]

40:04.669 --> 40:06.536
[three]
what the hell?

40:06.538 --> 40:07.437
Uh!

40:07.439 --> 40:09.439
[screams]

40:11.610 --> 40:16.846
[coughing]

40:16.848 --> 40:26.956

40:26.958 --> 40:36.966

40:36.968 --> 40:47.877
¶

40:47.879 --> 40:53.450
[doors open]

40:59.491 --> 41:00.657
Ugh!

41:00.659 --> 41:05.628
[electric shock]

41:08.133 --> 41:08.164
