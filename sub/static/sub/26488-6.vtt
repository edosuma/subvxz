WOMAN:
The crisis in Northern Syria

00:52.878 --> 00:54.576
has entered a critical phase.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.143
The latest offensive
has displaced

00:56.186 --> 00:59.015
thousands of men,
women and children.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.323
Their only option is to head
for the Turkish border.

01:02.366 --> 01:05.152
Tens of thousands,
according to INR.While Turkey's

01:05.195 --> 01:07.937
Foreign Minister Tarhan
and his government

01:07.980 --> 01:09.591
are making heroic efforts,

01:09.634 --> 01:12.246
they cannot manage
the crisis alone.

01:12.289 --> 01:15.684
And today, we are still
five billion dollars short

01:15.727 --> 01:17.120
of the bare minimum

01:17.164 --> 01:20.993
Turkey needs to provide food,
shelter and clothing.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.909
Without these necessities,
the refugees face

01:23.953 --> 01:25.911
starvation, exposure

01:25.955 --> 01:28.175
and eventual death.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.615
Gets your attention?Not enough.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.138
We're still five billion short.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.140
Donor fatigue is real.Six years of war.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.055
If we fail here, it sends a
signal to the rest of the world

01:39.099 --> 01:40.056
that Syria doesn't matter.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.144
Well, then we
better not fail.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.667
Blake, call
the White House.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.408
See if there's any spare
change under the cushions.

01:44.452 --> 01:45.975
Yes, ma'am.I'll light a fire
under the gaggle.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.324
Tie 'em to a spit
if you have to.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.109
We need public pressure,
we need it now.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.414
I want you two
to work the floor.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.676
I want to see those

Monsieur Lenoir,
we're-we're looking at

01:55.245 --> 01:58.205
exponential growth of
instability in the Middle East.

01:58.248 --> 02:01.512
And France has invested more
in antiterrorism than anyone.

02:01.556 --> 02:02.948
We've given all we can.

02:02.992 --> 02:06.082
Even a small donation from
you could prime the pump

02:06.126 --> 02:08.563
and-and inspire others to revise
their own pledges and prove,

02:08.606 --> 02:10.304
once and for all,
that the generosity

02:10.347 --> 02:12.132
of the French people
is unparalleled.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.960
So, what do you say, huh?

02:15.004 --> 02:17.441

As we all know,

02:22.316 --> 02:25.145
the generosity of the German
people is unparalleled.

02:25.188 --> 02:28.235
Indeed. But why should we
give when the United States

02:28.278 --> 02:30.150
denies asylum to
so many Syrians?

02:30.193 --> 02:33.153
Well, we're facing
some political headwinds.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.459
Really? My government
has taken in

02:35.503 --> 02:37.766
more than half
a million refugees.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.812
And you dare ask us
for more money?

02:43.206 --> 02:44.729
No.

02:44.773 --> 02:46.209
The Emirates would be happy
to make an additional pledge

02:46.253 --> 02:48.429
if you go first.

02:48.472 --> 02:51.214
Oh, well, the United States
already made

02:51.258 --> 02:52.737
a pledge of $1.2 billion.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.565
That's more than four times
what the UAE has offered.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.828
1.2 billion is less than

02:56.872 --> 02:59.135
one tenth of one percent
of your GDP.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.182
In relative terms, my country
is far ahead of you.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.227
So you might say that
the generosity

03:04.271 --> 03:07.535
of the Emirati people
is unparalleled.

03:17.066 --> 03:20.548

03:20.591 --> 03:24.247
1.2 billion

Go ahead.So we're out of luck
until the next fiscal year.

eight families to a tent.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.777

in the press.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.388
So far, the world
is more concerned

last rebel stronghold

03:42.657 --> 03:44.311
between the Syrian army
and the border.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.574
Yeah, the refugee numbers
will go up dramatically.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.489
Along with
the deprivation.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.665
I mean, even if we pull
a rabbit out of a hat

03:50.708 --> 03:53.145
on the five billion,
now it might not be enough.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.756
And Congress
won't save us.

03:54.799 --> 03:58.063
No way Morejon and Callister let
a new aid bill out of committee.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.935
What about DoD?They can retool

03:59.978 --> 04:01.719
operations to deliver the aid,
but in a war zone?

04:01.763 --> 04:03.243
Only so much they can do.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.157
But there is one thing
we haven't tried.

04:05.201 --> 04:07.203
China.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.553
Could be a reach. They're
stingy for the same reason.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.512
Yeah, I mean, that last typhoon
in the Philippines?

The answer is no.

Chen, come on.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.293
The United Nations has failed

04:53.336 --> 04:55.382
and you want us to donate.

04:55.425 --> 04:56.687

04:56.731 --> 04:58.863
Surely you can
see the upside

04:58.907 --> 05:01.649
in helping refugees.

05:01.692 --> 05:05.348
China invests where
it has the most interest.

Technology, for instance.

05:07.002 --> 05:08.569
Even a small pledge

05:08.612 --> 05:11.398
would bring immense prestige

the U.N. has made

06:32.479 --> 06:33.480
to end the Syrian civil war

Yeah, thanks to Russia.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.528
I'd hoped, at the minimum,
that this conference

could provide some relief
for its victims.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.010
Well, babe,
you did what you could.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.315
Sometimes that has
to be enough.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.187
Nope. I'm reaching out
to Moscow.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.581
See if they can help
broker a cease-fire.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.452
That can't possibly last.

to UNHQ, New York.

official schedule.

Madam Secretary.
You leave us no choice.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.325
These pledges are
the final insult.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.545
Humanitarian aid
is a long game.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.112
You have to be patient.Patient?

Do you know how near
impossible it is to house,

feed, provide drinking water
for millions of refugees?

08:28.682 --> 08:30.901
To screen for the terrorists
that have murdered

hundreds of Turkish citizens?I assure you no one doubts
the magnitude of your challenge.

Comforting words.
You know what's more comforting?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.256
Five billion dollars in aid.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.606
Turkey can't do its part

08:39.649 --> 08:42.609
until the international
community does theirs.

08:42.652 --> 08:45.568
I give you my word
the United States will

08:45.612 --> 08:49.311
make good on the shortfall
in the next fiscal year.

to murder my president

08:58.494 --> 09:00.148
and overthrow our government?

with that coup, and you know it.

another pit stop.

Yeah, time flies.

to be refueled.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.773
Still enough time
to sink a Guinness.And curse the gods

with the range of a tadpole.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.080

a pint, ma'am?

10:03.124 --> 10:05.256
No, I think I'd like
the bad news first.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.128
Well, all flights
are grounded.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.220
Efac... Come again?Yeah.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.570
It means
"island mountain glacier"

10:14.614 --> 10:15.919
in Icelandic.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.399

10:17.442 --> 10:19.619
Since when do
glaciers erupt?

10:19.662 --> 10:22.665
It's really a volcano beneath
the glacier which melted.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.320
Anyway, the prevailing winds
have pushed the ash cloud

10:25.363 --> 10:26.800
in our direction,

10:26.843 --> 10:28.671
and those particles
have a nasty habit

10:28.715 --> 10:31.108

jet engine failure.

probably just flattering him.

that eased the pain

17:34.575 --> 17:38.318
was flying a F-18 at Mach 2,
and then I would drive

17:38.361 --> 17:40.624

17:40.668 --> 17:42.365

20:18.565 --> 20:22.395
Yes. Your security people
stole my outlet.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.833
So either hand over
half of that corned beef,

20:25.876 --> 20:30.316
or we declare the bathroom
sovereign Dutch territory.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.187
We have flags.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.450
Hmm.

20:38.541 --> 20:41.240
Mm... What's your
chess rating?

20:43.285 --> 20:45.722
2765.

20:45.766 --> 20:49.726
Number one in the Netherlands,
number eight in the world.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.033
Eight, wow.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.951
Middle school champion,
Dallas County, Texas.

20:56.994 --> 20:59.780
Cracked top 20 in the state.
I'll tell you what.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.391
I'll play you for it.

21:02.435 --> 21:03.653
WOMAN [over P.A. system]:
Paging Miss Peters.

21:03.697 --> 21:06.090
Please come to the help desk.

21:06.134 --> 21:08.005
Paging Miss Peters.
Please come to the help desk.

21:08.049 --> 21:11.095
I like your hair.

21:11.139 --> 21:13.924
Oh, thank you.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.796
Your hijab's pretty rad.

21:15.839 --> 21:18.581
Thank you.
[chuckles]

21:18.625 --> 21:20.148
Walk with me.

21:20.191 --> 21:23.673
Is it just me, or are you
sensing a thaw with the Turks?

21:23.717 --> 21:25.327
No, no, it's not just you.

21:25.371 --> 21:26.981
I mean, uh, we're
talking, at least.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.374
Well, then,
let's exploit it.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.376
We never really discussed
incentives for Turkey.

21:30.419 --> 21:31.507
Yes, because
anything worth giving

21:31.551 --> 21:33.292
would require approval
from Congress.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.163
Yeah, guns and loans.
I-I know.

21:35.206 --> 21:37.731
But Tarhan was
headed to the U.N.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.515
before his plane
was grounded by

21:39.559 --> 21:41.474
ayefahder-fardu...

21:41.517 --> 21:44.564
Uh, yak trolls, so--
We ever figure out why?

21:44.607 --> 21:46.740
Um, yes. Yes, Daisy got
the official schedule.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.002
They are going
to lobby for

21:48.045 --> 21:49.482
a rotating seat
on the Security Council.

21:49.525 --> 21:50.787
Huh.

21:50.831 --> 21:53.616
Taking their newfound
leverage out for a spin.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.139
Yeah, but Turkey
hasn't held one

21:55.183 --> 21:57.490
in over 40 years,
so I-- [scoffs]

21:57.533 --> 21:59.883
And that volcano hadn't
erupted in 4,000.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.407
Two-thirds vote.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.234
We're gonna have to
call in a lot of favors.

22:03.278 --> 22:06.368
Well, we've got food,
electricity and time.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.109
Let's get calling.

22:15.638 --> 22:16.900
[timer clicks]

22:18.772 --> 22:20.730
[clicks]

22:20.774 --> 22:23.385
Queen out early.
Aggressive.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.082
Always been a fan
of Nakamura.

22:26.997 --> 22:29.391
He's difficult to imitate.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.654
Not for me.

22:33.090 --> 22:35.223
Practically paid my way
through college hustling chess.

22:36.616 --> 22:37.747
[clicks]

22:37.791 --> 22:41.447
[stammers] Just the
book fees, but still.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.412
You don't want to castle?[chuckles]

22:50.456 --> 22:53.154
When I'm about to slay
your knight?

22:56.070 --> 22:57.637
It's your move.

23:00.814 --> 23:03.077
You know, sometimes I wonder

23:03.120 --> 23:06.472
if I could've turned pro.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.604
If I really stuck with it.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.955
Checkmate.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.914
Two out of three?
T-Two, two...

23:13.957 --> 23:15.089
two-two out of three.

23:15.132 --> 23:18.005
Get another sandwich.

23:27.754 --> 23:29.277
[sighs]

23:32.759 --> 23:34.456
How's the speech coming?

23:34.500 --> 23:36.719
Oh, it's getting there.

23:36.763 --> 23:40.593
So, uh, that whole, um...

23:40.636 --> 23:43.639
non-monogomous, go-with-the-flow
type of thing,

23:43.683 --> 23:44.901
is that something you

23:44.945 --> 23:46.686
want to talk about?Clearly, you didn't.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.949
In front of Mom's
speechwriter? No.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.472
[sighs]

23:50.516 --> 23:52.300
But, look, I was just--

23:52.343 --> 23:53.562
Wanted to make sure that you
and your boyfriend

23:53.606 --> 23:55.564
are on the same page.Okay.

23:55.608 --> 23:58.567
First of all, "boyfriend"
is a label of the patriarchy.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.395
And there is no page.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.788
That's kind of the whole point.

24:01.831 --> 24:04.791
The whole point is
not to communicate with your...

24:04.834 --> 24:06.488
[stammers] non-boyfriend?No.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.186
There's no need to
define things because

24:09.230 --> 24:10.753
we're not
in a relationship.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.713
It just is,
we're just being.

24:13.756 --> 24:14.757
What?

24:14.801 --> 24:16.585
Too existential for you?

24:16.629 --> 24:17.891
No, it's too risky.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.806
If one of you is more invested
than the other.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.242
That's not gonna happen because

24:21.285 --> 24:22.939
we're not investing.If you don't
communicate,

24:22.983 --> 24:24.332
how do you know whether
you're investing?

24:24.375 --> 24:25.376
How do you know you're not
setting yourself up

24:25.420 --> 24:27.466
for heartbreak?
Oh, my God.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.293
Stop Socratic method-ing me.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.817
I'm not worried
about heartbreak.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.471
O-Okay, but you're not
the first generation

24:32.514 --> 24:34.603
to try this kind
of thing, you know.

24:34.647 --> 24:37.214
You don't know anything
about my generation.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.912
So keep your
neo-Victorian judgments

24:38.955 --> 24:40.522
to yourself, okay?

24:40.566 --> 24:42.002
[stammers]

24:42.045 --> 24:43.569
Do you see him during the day?

24:43.612 --> 24:46.702
Uh, does he work?
Ali, come on.

Label of the patriarchy?

24:48.704 --> 24:50.271
I'm neo-offended.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.665
Victorian father would have
just locked her in the attic.

24:52.708 --> 24:55.624
Hmm, or sent her
to the workhouse.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.931
Sewing blankets for gruel.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.846
You got to admit,
those parents had options.

24:59.889 --> 25:02.675
I'd trade antibiotics for that.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.373
I had a feeling

25:05.416 --> 25:08.507
that you would not be able
to resist weighing in.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.986

"There's no page!"

25:15.601 --> 25:17.167
[snickers]

25:17.211 --> 25:18.386
Oh, babe, I got to go.

25:18.429 --> 25:19.779
Are you ready for the speech
tomorrow?

25:19.822 --> 25:21.041
HENRY:
Yeah, yeah.

25:21.084 --> 25:23.565
But, you know,
nobody likes a pinch hitter.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.176
Well, then,

love you, too, okay?

25:28.918 --> 25:29.876

Love you, too. Bye.

25:29.919 --> 25:32.443
Bye. Did we get the vote?

25:32.487 --> 25:34.271
Well, I promised
the president of Togo

25:34.315 --> 25:35.838
a visa for his pet hippo.

25:35.882 --> 25:38.624
Can hippos get visas?

25:38.667 --> 25:39.799
I don't know.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.627
It's above
my pay grade.
Good enough.

25:41.670 --> 25:42.932
I'm bringing
it to Tarhan.

25:47.458 --> 25:50.549
What happened
to aggressive?

25:50.592 --> 25:52.855
Biding my time.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.683
Like a ninja.

26:00.080 --> 26:04.911
Or guy who spent all night
googling the Slav Defense.

26:04.954 --> 26:07.653
Okay. The rust is off.

26:07.696 --> 26:10.003
And nunchucks
are coming out.

26:13.136 --> 26:15.661
Besides, the middle game
is where I really shine.

26:18.272 --> 26:19.578
At least, it was
in sixth grade.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.286
Checkmate.

26:33.766 --> 26:34.767
[chuckles]

26:34.810 --> 26:38.727
Sorry.
But... [sighs]

26:38.771 --> 26:41.817
...a Slav Defense
with a knight

26:41.861 --> 26:45.168

and the queen.

in second grade.

27:02.272 --> 27:03.709

For you to even mess around
with someone like me.

27:06.668 --> 27:10.324
So...
I like messing
around with you.

27:12.848 --> 27:16.852

Aw, guys. He's ready
to kill for her already.

31:27.798 --> 31:29.148
Hey-hey-hey, the
Russian was cheating,

31:29.191 --> 31:30.758
and now he's playing
China in the final

31:30.801 --> 31:32.586
and they'll just cheat
their way to victory again.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.240
Yeah, we're talking
about Russia here.

31:34.283 --> 31:35.806
Greatest chess playing
nation in the world.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.896
Yeah, but get this, Dremov,
the guy who beat her,

31:37.939 --> 31:39.462
his rating's
gone up by, like,

31:39.506 --> 31:42.552
200 points in the
last six months.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.424
That's a lot.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.252
Can you get me footage
of that tournament?

31:46.295 --> 31:48.471
[laughing]:
Yeah, okay.

31:48.515 --> 31:49.908
HENRY:
And then, in 2005,

31:49.951 --> 31:53.085
Elizabeth forward deployed
to Iraq.

31:53.128 --> 31:56.915
I'd flown over those coordinates
during Desert Storm, but now,

31:56.958 --> 31:59.308
it was my turn to wait at home.

31:59.352 --> 32:04.618
So... on the nights
when I couldn't sleep

32:04.661 --> 32:07.229
'cause I was worried about her--

32:07.273 --> 32:09.449
basically, all of them--

32:09.492 --> 32:10.711
[laughs softly]

32:10.754 --> 32:13.496
I would reach
for the family Bible and...

32:13.540 --> 32:15.020
leaf to a page in Exodus.

32:15.063 --> 32:17.631
And-and there was
some comfort there,

32:17.674 --> 32:20.764
knowing that hardship
is part of our journey

32:20.808 --> 32:24.638
and our trials have a purpose.

32:24.681 --> 32:27.249
On behalf of my wife
and all Americans,

32:27.293 --> 32:30.644
I want to thank you
for supporting our diplomats.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.559
And for keeping the faith.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.256
-Thanks.
-[applause]

32:34.300 --> 32:36.302
[indistinct chatter]

32:38.173 --> 32:40.523
I know she's thinking
about you every day,

32:40.567 --> 32:42.699
how proud she is of you.
Thanks for coming.

32:42.743 --> 32:45.659
Thank you.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.922
Well played, with Exodus.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.750
Well, I hope it helped.

32:49.793 --> 32:51.447
Well, it certainly helped me.

32:51.491 --> 32:53.014
I spoke to Ronnie this morning

32:53.058 --> 32:56.887
and we made plans to meet up
in Hawaii in a couple weeks.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.889
Well, that's great.

32:58.933 --> 33:01.109
I'm a little surprised
Elizabeth approved vacation

33:01.153 --> 33:02.328
on such short notice, but...

33:02.371 --> 33:03.590
Oh, I haven't asked her yet.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.505
I was hoping you could
put in a good word.

33:05.548 --> 33:07.333
Thanks, Doc.

33:13.078 --> 33:16.211
Huh. You're not crazy.

33:16.255 --> 33:17.734
Right? You see it, too.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.128
Yeah, this guy's
some kind of spotter.

33:20.172 --> 33:23.566
Well, t-there must
be a-a relay, or...

33:23.610 --> 33:25.090
Yeah, look.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.135
The spotter gets the move
from someone in the audience

33:27.179 --> 33:29.398
with a phone and passes it
to the player.

33:29.442 --> 33:32.010
Now all I have to do
is prove it.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.881
This isn't enough?Oh, no.

33:33.924 --> 33:37.711
The World Chess Players
Association won't take action

33:37.754 --> 33:40.583
until we link each signal

33:40.627 --> 33:42.063
to a specific move
on the board.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.631
No proof, no leverage.
That makes sense.

33:44.674 --> 33:48.809
So, you really think that Russia
is gonna stop a war over chess?

33:48.852 --> 33:50.637
Well, who said anything
about Russia?

33:50.680 --> 33:52.595
Oh, you're going back to Chen.

33:52.639 --> 33:56.034
He wants Chinese dominance
in all things.

33:56.077 --> 34:00.690
If I can hand him chess glory
on a platter,

34:00.734 --> 34:04.085
maybe he'll pony up
for humanitarian aid.

34:04.129 --> 34:07.654
I guess this is some
kind of grid pattern.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.178
But there are 64 squares,
six different types of pieces.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.746
That is a hell of a lot
of combinations.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.400
Yeah, but we're out of time.

34:14.443 --> 34:19.579
The final match between China
and Russia starts tomorrow.

34:19.622 --> 34:21.581
NSA could do it.

34:21.624 --> 34:26.151
No, there's a giant bureaucracy
and chain of command

34:26.194 --> 34:28.892
between us and the
supercomputers at Fort Meade.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.591
SecDef, Ellen Hill...

34:31.634 --> 34:33.593
We'll get Dalton
to sign a waiver.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.944
Do you really think
he'd go for it?

34:36.987 --> 34:38.641
He'd better.

34:38.685 --> 34:42.167
As ethics advisor, I will tell
him this is a moral outrage

34:42.210 --> 34:44.517
that cannot
be tolerated.Okay.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.301
I mean, Russia is the country
that gave us Botvinnik,

34:46.345 --> 34:48.695
Kasparov, Karpov and Kramnik.

34:48.738 --> 34:51.915
What happened to working hard to
be the best like those guys did?

34:51.959 --> 34:53.917
Wh-What happened
to excellence? I mean,

34:53.961 --> 34:55.615
Russia's the country
that beat us

34:55.658 --> 34:57.660
by putting the first
man in space.

34:57.704 --> 35:00.620
Now it seems their only
national accomplishment

35:00.663 --> 35:02.622
is leading the world
in cheating.

35:02.665 --> 35:04.145
Look at the Olympic
doping scandal.

35:04.189 --> 35:05.668
They cheat at their elections,

35:05.712 --> 35:07.714
not to mention the elections
of other countries.

35:07.757 --> 35:10.586
They are champions
only of deception

35:10.630 --> 35:14.155
and undermining others, and if
we don't stop them, and fast,

35:14.199 --> 35:16.766
we are gonna see the death
of principles and norms

35:16.810 --> 35:19.726
that protect basic human
achievement and dignity.

35:19.769 --> 35:21.728
Babe, I love it.

35:21.771 --> 35:25.166
Call him.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.342
Just...
I'm calling him.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.257
I knew it. The perfidious dogs.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.129
Do you really have proof?

35:31.172 --> 35:32.869
NSA broke the code an hour ago.

35:32.913 --> 35:34.915
Then I'm sure the Players
Association will take

35:34.958 --> 35:37.526
prompt action
and disqualify Russia.

35:37.570 --> 35:40.703
Oh, I haven't told them.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.140
You see,

35:42.183 --> 35:45.534
America invests
where it has the most interest.

35:45.578 --> 35:48.581
And that sure as hell
ain't chess.

35:48.624 --> 35:51.236
The U.N. is short
five billion dollars.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.847
Do you really expect us to make
up the entire difference?

35:53.890 --> 35:58.547
No, but where China leads,
others will follow.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.810
Do you have any idea

36:00.854 --> 36:02.725
how much money China puts
into its chess team?

36:02.769 --> 36:05.424
Great achievements
require great sacrifice.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.208
Between masseurs,

36:09.602 --> 36:12.953
$100 million,
in the last year alone.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.563
Let's start with that.

36:14.607 --> 36:18.176
Such a gift would be
unprecedented.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.568
So would a gold medal.

36:19.612 --> 36:23.181
Unless you'd prefer
the virtual kind.

36:25.095 --> 36:27.054

42:20.625 --> 42:22.365
...but there's a long road
ahead of them.

42:22.409 --> 42:24.933
Fate.

42:24.977 --> 42:28.110
...millions of Syrian refugees
who are already seeking asylum,

42:28.154 --> 42:31.940
and no one knows where
that process will end.

42:31.984 --> 42:36.815
It's a life of uncertainty,
but at least they found hope.

42:36.858 --> 42:39.992
Did I just force Alison
to move out?

42:40.035 --> 42:42.908
No.

42:42.951 --> 42:44.300
That was fate, too.
