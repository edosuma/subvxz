00:14.240 --> 00:18.560
- What's going on?
- Getting MALP telemetry from P3X-289.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.800
Atmosphere is completely toxic.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.760
Sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide,
methane, ammonia.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.800
If there was a gate,
there was life there at some point.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.080
Yeah, I think that's a safe assumption.
Look at this.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.280
We got these images two hours ago
after the MALP went through.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.760
The dome seems to be the only thing that
withstood the effects of the atmosphere.

00:37.840 --> 00:43.040
- How big is it?
- About 2.2km wide and 500 metres high.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.120
The MALP's giving us a proximity alert.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.920
Three metres,
and we're picking up a static charge.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.520
Stop.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.400
Extend the arm.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.840
- It went right through.
- Whatever it is, it's not solid.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.840
Move forward.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.640
We've lost contact.
The MALP's not responding.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.920
Bring up that last image.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.320
- How is that possible?
- I have no idea.

02:41.680 --> 02:46.920
- Colonel O'Neill, report.
- We're good, sir, but not much of a view.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.560
<i>- What about suit integrity?
- The hazmats could withstand</i>

02:50.640 --> 02:53.880
12 hours of exposure
before any serious degradation.

02:53.960 --> 02:58.200
<i>Not a problem, sir. We can make
it to the dome and back inside an hour.</i>

02:58.280 --> 03:00.680
Understood. Hammond out.

03:10.400 --> 03:16.000
<i>- Picking up a static charge.
- Yeah, I can feel it.</i>

03:18.800 --> 03:22.400
<i>So what do we do,
just walk through?</i>

03:22.480 --> 03:26.440
<i>- The MALP met no resistance.
- But it disappeared.</i>

03:26.520 --> 03:32.440
It did transmit for a while before we lost
the signal, which suggests it got through.

04:02.840 --> 04:07.920
<i>I'm reading normal atmosphere -
oxygen, nitrogen.</i>

04:09.560 --> 04:11.960
We're clean, too.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.640
<i>Seems the barrier scrubbed
the suits when we passed through.</i>

04:15.720 --> 04:20.959
<i>The inside of the barrier
seems to be some kind of hologram.</i>

04:21.040 --> 04:23.800
You can feel the resistance.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.800
That, combined with the static charge,
must act as a warning,

04:27.880 --> 04:31.080
so you don't accidentally step through.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.040
The MALP appears to be fully operational.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.600
The barrier must block the signal.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.840
This is an amazing piece of technology.

04:46.920 --> 04:51.320
Permeable to solid objects, but won't
allow the poisonous atmosphere in.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.000
We really need to study this further.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.600
All right, come on out. Let's go.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.360
Hello.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.760
We're not gonna hurt you.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.600
- You came from outside.
- Yes, we did.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.920
- What's your name?
- What's yours?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.400
I asked you first.

05:42.200 --> 05:45.480
- I'm called Nevin.
- Hello, Nevin.

05:45.560 --> 05:49.360
I'm Jack. That's Sam, Daniel and Teal'c.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.920
You wear strange clothes.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.240
You caught us on a bad day.

05:56.320 --> 06:00.080
- Nevin, where are your parents?
- My father's in the town.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.360
- Can you show us?
- We just want to talk to him.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.600
Maybe we could trade.

06:24.640 --> 06:30.520
You know, sir, we probably could have
found the town without his help.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.320
- Nevin?
- I found some people in the garden.

07:00.400 --> 07:03.800
Jack, Sam, Daniel and Teal'c.

07:06.040 --> 07:10.840
- I'm Kendrick, Nevin's father.
- I assume you don't get many visitors.

07:10.920 --> 07:14.840
We thought we were the only survivors.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.520
Survivors of what, exactly?

07:19.520 --> 07:22.000
You'd better speak to the council.

07:31.520 --> 07:36.680
<i>- You came from outside the dome?
- That's right.</i>

07:36.760 --> 07:42.000
But the atmosphere is toxic. Anyone who
went outside would die almost instantly.

07:42.080 --> 07:46.560
- We wore protective suits.
- But where do you come from, originally?

07:46.640 --> 07:51.720
From a planet called Earth.
It's about 6,000 light years from here.

07:51.800 --> 07:56.120
- You came in a spaceship?
- No, we came through the Stargate.

07:56.200 --> 08:01.680
It's that big, circular object with symbols
carved on it. It's right outside the dome.

08:04.120 --> 08:08.480
- There must be a historical reference to...
- One moment, please.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.200
The Gate of Mahg Mar.
Discovered 563 years ago.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.120
Believed to have been of significance
in the worship of Goddess Morrigan.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.120
Taken from Danaan and displayed
in the National Museum of History.

08:31.200 --> 08:35.159
- So you do know about the gate?
- We do now.

08:36.880 --> 08:41.200
We've accessed the relevant information
through the Link.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.400
It's a direct neural interface
with a databank.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.560
Ow.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.480
The Link contains
the sum total of our knowledge -

08:48.560 --> 08:51.440
all our history, our culture,
our science. Everything.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.320
You can call up this information
whenever you need it?

08:54.400 --> 08:56.400
Precisely.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.200
Think this'll work?

09:08.280 --> 09:11.760
The signal was lost only when
the transmitter crossed the barrier.

09:11.840 --> 09:16.760
We need only manoeuvre the MALP
into the correct position.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.200
Nice.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.160
We have a scheduled
radio contact with SG-1, sir.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.880
Dial the gate.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.240
<i>SG-1, this is General Hammond. Come in.</i>

09:37.920 --> 09:41.080
<i>Yes, sir. We read you, loud and clear.</i>

09:41.160 --> 09:44.200
<i>- Loud and clear.
- Colonel O'Neill, report.</i>

09:44.280 --> 09:47.640
<i>It turns out this planet's
not so dead after all, sir.</i>

09:47.720 --> 09:50.000
<i>- I take it the dome's inhabited.
- Yes, sir.</i>

09:50.080 --> 09:54.480
<i>So far the natives are very friendly,
if a bit odd, if you know what I mean.</i>

09:54.560 --> 09:58.600
<i>- Will they share information?
- They'll show Carter the technical stuff.</i>

09:58.680 --> 10:01.840
<i>In the meantime,
they've offered to put us up for the night.</i>

10:01.920 --> 10:04.600
All right, next contact in 24 hours.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.920
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

10:20.680 --> 10:23.160
Thank you.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.520
- What?
- How many planets have you been to?

10:52.920 --> 10:55.280
I don't know. Lots.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.880
- More than ten?
- Yeah.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.840
- More than 20?
- Yes.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.440
- More than 30?
- Yeah.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.080
- More than 40?
- Yes.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.440
- More than 50?
- Maybe.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.760
Nevin...

11:06.840 --> 11:09.360
Let the poor man eat.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.000
It's more than 50, isn't it?

11:15.320 --> 11:18.600
You think it's too late to pitch a tent?

11:28.520 --> 11:33.080
- Are you sure you've had enough to eat?
- Yes, it was delicious.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.560
You've obviously no trouble growing food.

11:35.640 --> 11:39.760
- Everything in the dome is self-sufficient.
- What about power?

11:39.840 --> 11:43.040
We draw energy from geothermal vents
beneath the town.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.320
Tomorrow I can show you the generators.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.800
Pallan's one of the technicians
who maintains the system.

11:48.880 --> 11:53.480
Your level of architecture seems to be
out of step with your level of technology.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.880
Technology destroyed our world.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.440
The dome was created because
industrial growth poisoned the air.

11:59.520 --> 12:05.520
Our people were dying, so the survivors
made a choice to simplify their lives.

12:05.600 --> 12:10.400
We have environmental problems. If we
learned your history, it might help us.

12:10.480 --> 12:15.760
The easiest way for you to learn
about our history is through the Link.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.920
- Is that possible?
- Of course.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.520
Thousands of historical books are on file.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.480
Maybe that isn't such a good idea.

12:27.680 --> 12:32.360
We don't know if our brain physiology
is compatible with the technology.

12:32.440 --> 12:33.920
Ah.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.160
Thanks. Maybe later.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.760
Hello, Nevin.

14:11.840 --> 14:16.720
I'm not Nevin. I'm Colonel O'Neill
from Stargate Command.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.360
All right, Colonel O'Neill.

14:23.040 --> 14:26.000
Will you please take off my hood?

14:28.840 --> 14:32.360
Nevin, time for school.
Go to your room and access your lessons.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.840
When I grow up, can I be an explorer?

14:36.840 --> 14:39.240
We'll talk about it later.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.680
- None of you has been out of the dome?
- Not in over 400 years.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.320
We monitor the levels of toxicity,
but we've never seen it.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.400
- What's it like?
- It's not very pretty.

14:58.480 --> 15:03.560
I've seen images on the Link of a great
city with tall buildings of glass and steel.

15:03.640 --> 15:07.440
I'm afraid there's not much left but rubble.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.520
I suppose...

15:10.480 --> 15:13.040
that's why they created this.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.800
So we're not always reminded
of what happened.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.760
A pretty convincing illusion.
I'd love to see how it's made.

15:25.840 --> 15:31.240
The control room's underground,
but the entrance is this way.

15:48.160 --> 15:52.040
As you can see, Major, we haven't
abandoned technology altogether.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.920
Yeah.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.760
If using the Link is out of the question,
then this is your only option.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.520
We don't have much need
for books any more.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.680
These are all that's left from the old world.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.680
Interesting. The writing's similar
to a language we've seen before.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.440
Can you translate it?

16:24.520 --> 16:26.520
With your help?

16:26.600 --> 16:28.640
Let's get started.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.720
Atmospheric analysis,
dome integrity, power utilisation.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.880
Very impressive.

16:39.960 --> 16:45.640
If you don't mind, I just have
to check the coolant pressure. Please.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.960
Pallan.

16:55.960 --> 16:59.360
This looks like some kind of religious text.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.240
Evalla?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.839
Evalla.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.720
Pallan?

17:12.720 --> 17:14.480
Yes?

17:14.560 --> 17:17.359
- Are you OK?
- Of course.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.359
Let me see.

17:28.359 --> 17:30.760
- Did you see that?
- See what?

17:30.840 --> 17:34.080
The screens became filled
with some sort of streaming code.

17:34.160 --> 17:38.600
lmpossible. They always display
the status of these systems.

17:38.680 --> 17:43.680
- I know what I saw, Pallan.
- I'm afraid you must be mistaken.

17:55.680 --> 17:59.880
- So, what do we know?
- Well, their technology's incredible.

17:59.960 --> 18:05.960
Pallan and I are rigging up a computer
interface to download some of the specs.

18:13.040 --> 18:16.000
- Do they wish anything in return?
- Apparently not.

18:16.080 --> 18:21.840
- They seem happy with their situation.
- It makes no sense. They live in a bubble.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.760
They've managed to survive
for over 400 years.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.880
Sometimes there is more to life
than mere survival.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.760
We could offer them relocation.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.000
Yeah, I suppose.

18:34.800 --> 18:39.240
- Are you suggesting we leave the dome?
- We're just saying it's possible.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.040
There are many worlds
where your people can live.

18:42.120 --> 18:46.240
- But we have all we need right here.
- Except room to grow.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.640
We're talking about fresh water,
fresh air, mountains, trees.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.520
We can experience all these things
through the Link.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.920
You've gotta be kidding me.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.840
It is a very generous offer, Colonel,
but this is our home.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.520
What about the other folks in the town?

19:02.600 --> 19:05.080
Some of them have to think differently.

19:05.160 --> 19:09.760
The council speaks for the town,
and the council's decision is unanimous.

19:09.840 --> 19:15.360
What about the other council member,
the woman that was here?

19:15.440 --> 19:19.200
There hasn't been a woman
on the council since the last election.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.320
And that was two years ago.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.800
What? There was
a woman here yesterday.

19:23.880 --> 19:29.960
Colonel, I can assure you, the council
has always consisted of three members.

19:46.400 --> 19:51.560
I spoke to Pallan. He has no memory of
there ever being a fourth council member.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.680
She was just there yesterday.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.040
Maybe the Link
has something to do with this.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.920
If it can download data
into people's brains,

19:59.000 --> 20:03.760
maybe it can also be used
to alter their perceptions or memories.

20:05.200 --> 20:08.240
Perhaps she opposed the others
and they got rid of her.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.440
So they erased her from existence?
Seems a little harsh.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.640
The bottom line is
we can't trust these people.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.960
I'd still like to finish my research
on the dome technology.

20:18.040 --> 20:20.960
Maybe something in the archive
can shed some light on it.

20:21.040 --> 20:26.600
The behaviour of the people does seem
odd, but they don't appear to be a threat.

20:28.040 --> 20:31.040
All right, see what you can find out.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.160
How's it coming?

20:44.240 --> 20:49.120
I still can't find any historical reference to
the time period when the dome was built.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.760
By then, our people
had begun using the Link.

20:51.840 --> 20:56.360
It's possible not much written material
survives from that era.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.680
Let me ask you something.

21:00.600 --> 21:07.280
If you had a chance to leave the dome and
live on another planet, would you take it?

21:07.360 --> 21:10.320
Pallan told me about the talk
you had with the council.

21:10.400 --> 21:14.160
- And?
- We have everything we need right here.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.040
That's what they said.

21:16.120 --> 21:20.520
We hope someday the poison'll dissipate
and we'll be able to reclaim the planet.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.800
- But not in your lifetime.
- No.

21:23.880 --> 21:27.400
What about children? Don't you
and Pallan want to have a family?

21:27.480 --> 21:30.160
Of course.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.520
But there must be population controls.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.800
- A couple's allowed a maximum of two.
- You're OK with that?

21:35.880 --> 21:40.160
Limited resources dictate we maintain
the population at a certain level.

21:40.240 --> 21:44.480
- How many people are we talking about?
- At this precise moment?

21:44.560 --> 21:46.840
1,373.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.520
And what would happen
if someone decided to break the rules

21:52.600 --> 21:55.320
and have more than two children?

21:55.400 --> 21:57.320
I don't know.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.400
No one ever has.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.680
Try the interface now.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.800
We got it.

22:17.280 --> 22:20.280
You believe this technology
will be useful on your world?

22:20.360 --> 22:23.120
Why don't you and your wife
come see for yourselves?

22:23.200 --> 22:24.720
Oh.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.800
Just for a visit.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.800
- Do you have oceans?
- Oceans, deserts, rainforests.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.840
- It would take a lifetime to see it all.
- It sounds wonderful.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.920
Wait a minute.

22:37.840 --> 22:42.200
- These are the power utilisation figures?
- That's right.

22:42.280 --> 22:46.720
- What's a normal variation?
- Between 0.01 and 0.07%.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.880
Well, then, we've got a problem.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.320
These levels are 2% lower
than when we first came down here.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.400
No, that can't be.

22:59.600 --> 23:03.440
No, you're mistaken.
These figures are within normal range.

23:03.520 --> 23:07.720
- Do you have this morning's readings?
- Of course.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.960
You see? No variation.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.640
This is wrong.

23:16.720 --> 23:20.880
- These measurements are foreign to you.
- Doesn't mean I can't recognise a drop.

23:20.960 --> 23:25.560
Major, I can access 400 years of recorded
power utilisation figures on the Link.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.320
There's never been
more than a 0.1% variation.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.600
Hypothetically speaking, if there was,

23:31.680 --> 23:34.520
would it threaten
the integrity of the force field?

23:34.600 --> 23:38.040
I suppose it might, but it's never come up.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.440
Colonel O'Neill!

23:50.520 --> 23:54.080
Is it true you've offered to take us
through the gate to another world?

23:54.160 --> 23:55.920
Yeah, that's right.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.760
Then Nevin and I will come with you.

23:58.840 --> 24:03.560
I see the way he is with you. I realise he
deserves more than this world can offer.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.040
Are you certain?
This is not a decision to be taken lightly.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.920
I want my son to be in a world

24:09.000 --> 24:14.600
where the sky and the clouds aren't
part of an illusion created by computer.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.880
That's good enough for me.

24:22.720 --> 24:25.840
<i>- Colonel, come in.
- Go ahead.</i>

24:25.920 --> 24:30.080
Sir, I've run some calculations here
and I've discovered something.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.560
O'Neill.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.560
<i>Sir, are you reading me?</i>

24:37.680 --> 24:41.040
- Carter, the MALP's gone.
- Say again?

24:41.120 --> 24:45.160
The MALP is no longer parked
where we parked it.

24:45.240 --> 24:48.360
Someone does not wish us
to communicate with SGC.

24:48.440 --> 24:52.200
<i>That's not our only problem.
The dome is losing power.</i>

24:52.280 --> 24:56.880
I noticed a discrepancy with output levels,
but the computer data showed no change.

24:56.960 --> 25:02.520
<i>I converted the units and compared the
current levels with yesterday's readings.</i>

25:02.600 --> 25:03.600
And?

25:03.680 --> 25:08.320
In the last 24 hours
there's been almost a 4% drop.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.800
If this continues, the dome will fail.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.680
<i>- How much time?
- It's hard to say.</i>

25:13.760 --> 25:16.880
But when it does
everyone here will die.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.680
Evalla?

25:56.800 --> 26:01.200
The computer's giving me new data.
The power level is definitely dropping.

26:01.280 --> 26:04.880
<i>Major Carter,
should we not warn the townspeople?</i>

26:04.960 --> 26:06.960
I'm not sure we'd convince them.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.440
<i>Our only evidence is the readings,</i>

26:09.520 --> 26:13.120
<i>and, for some reason,
Pallan couldn't see they were changing.</i>

26:13.200 --> 26:15.200
Maybe he's in on it.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.120
<i>I don't think so.</i>

26:17.200 --> 26:23.480
I think his memories are being altered.
The same may hold true for the others.

26:25.480 --> 26:27.280
Evalla!

26:34.240 --> 26:36.040
Evalla!

27:12.800 --> 27:16.680
I called out to her and she ignored me.
It was like she was in a trance.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.200
Perhaps she was
under the influence of the Link.

27:19.280 --> 27:22.120
Who knows what level
of manipulation is possible?

27:22.200 --> 27:25.520
- So... brainwashing?
- That's one way of putting it.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.840
We have to help them.
They're being held against their will.

27:28.920 --> 27:34.000
As long as they've got those things on,
they won't be convinced of anything.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.200
Is it possible to disable the Link?

27:36.280 --> 27:38.800
The same computer system
controls the dome.

27:38.880 --> 27:43.120
If we tamper with it, we risk
bringing the whole force field down.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.040
However, if I could use the computer
to access the Link,

27:46.120 --> 27:48.720
maybe I could reprogram
the data being sent out.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.240
Do a little brainwashing of our own.

27:51.320 --> 27:53.880
The only problem is, I need Pallan's help.

27:53.960 --> 27:58.040
If I can find historical evidence
in the library that contradicts the Link,

27:58.120 --> 28:00.600
some people may believe
they're being lied to.

28:00.680 --> 28:05.200
The records of council meetings will show
there used to be over three members.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.080
Exactly.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.160
All right. You two do what you do.

28:14.240 --> 28:18.040
Teal'c, you and I
are late for a radio contact.

28:26.600 --> 28:29.000
Colonel O'Neill!

28:29.080 --> 28:30.880
Where are you going?

28:30.960 --> 28:34.600
Back to the house.
We need those special outfits we had.

28:34.680 --> 28:38.640
- The house is this way.
- You are mistaken. It is in that direction.

28:38.720 --> 28:42.560
There's nothing over there.
It's the edge of the dome.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.720
Come on, I'll show you.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.320
Here it is. See?
Right where you left it.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Hey.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.880
- Is this where we slept last night?
- It is not.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.360
What's going on here?

29:21.880 --> 29:23.800
Colonel.

29:23.880 --> 29:27.680
- Are you going back to Earth now?
- No, we were just gonna send a message.

29:27.760 --> 29:32.040
- Don't worry. We won't leave without you.
- Excuse me?

29:32.120 --> 29:35.640
Anyone who wants to leave
is welcome to come with us.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.600
Why would I leave?

29:38.680 --> 29:42.320
You desire to live in a world
where the sky is not artificial.

29:42.400 --> 29:46.000
You must have me mistaken
for someone else.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.880
Nevin, you wanted to be
an explorer, right?

29:50.960 --> 29:54.040
I'm going to be a gardener, like my father.

29:55.840 --> 29:59.800
- You are under the influence of the Link.
- What are you talking about?

29:59.880 --> 30:03.680
- Those things on your head - lose 'em.
- No, no.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.600
Yes.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.520
They're messing with your mind.
Get rid of 'em.

30:08.600 --> 30:13.840
- The Link gives us everything we need.
- Just take it off a minute. Just flick it off.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.440
I can't!

30:15.520 --> 30:19.160
To be disconnected from the Link
would cause instant death.

30:19.240 --> 30:23.880
Now, see, that's something
you've never said before.

30:23.960 --> 30:27.280
Colonel, I think you should leave now.

30:33.120 --> 30:37.400
<i>- Carter, what's your status?
- I'm on my way to the control room.</i>

30:37.480 --> 30:41.160
<i>Well, watch yourself.
They got to Kendrick.</i>

30:49.040 --> 30:52.280
I've almost finished
downloading the generator design.

30:52.360 --> 30:55.240
- Pallan, we need to talk.
- All right.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.880
Do you remember earlier I said
I noticed a drop in the power levels?

30:58.960 --> 31:01.560
I remember you being mistaken.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.640
What about now?
Do you notice any change?

31:05.720 --> 31:08.320
- Power levels are constant.
- No, they're not.

31:08.400 --> 31:12.680
It's just that every time these screens are
updated, the data on the Link is as well.

31:12.760 --> 31:15.760
It alters your memory,
so you don't see what's happening.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.600
Major, this is absurd.

31:17.680 --> 31:21.320
Pallan, the dome is failing.

31:21.400 --> 31:25.720
- I told you you're mistaken.
- No. I am not mistaken.

31:26.400 --> 31:31.240
If you don't help me warn the others, you,
Evalla and everyone in this city will die.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.920
- Who?
- Evalla, your wife.

31:34.920 --> 31:40.080
Major, I don't know what's come over you,
but I've never been married.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.520
I need you to disconnect yourself
from the Link.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.600
That's insane.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.520
You believe that
removing that node will kill you.

32:16.600 --> 32:20.480
- I've known that since childhood.
- Evalla removed hers. Nothing happened.

32:20.560 --> 32:24.280
- Who is this Evalla?
- I told you. She's your wife!

32:24.360 --> 32:26.480
Your memories of her have been altered,

32:26.560 --> 32:29.760
just as you've been kept
from realising the dome's dying.

32:29.840 --> 32:34.760
I thought the council was responsible, but
the changes are happening too quickly.

32:34.840 --> 32:38.000
I think it's automatic.
The computer makes changes,

32:38.080 --> 32:41.720
then updates the memories of everyone,
so no one's the wiser.

32:41.800 --> 32:45.960
- Pallan, you have to disconnect.
- That would be suicide.

32:46.040 --> 32:50.560
No. That's just a lie
that's been planted by the computer.

32:50.640 --> 32:56.880
We need to reprogram the Link to
convince the others, but I need your help.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.960
<i>- No.
- Sam!</i>

33:04.400 --> 33:06.200
- Got it.
- What is that?

33:06.280 --> 33:09.880
Legal documents.
All I can say is, thank God for lawyers.

33:09.960 --> 33:13.880
When everyone else was converting
to the Link, they still used paper.

33:13.960 --> 33:18.560
When the dome was made, you all signed
a contract on land ownership rights.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.640
Look at the number.

33:21.560 --> 33:24.640
- That can't be.
- There were originally 100,000 people.

33:24.720 --> 33:27.720
lmpossible. The dome
can't sustain that many.

33:27.800 --> 33:31.120
- Not any more.
- Oh, my God.

33:31.200 --> 33:34.400
I thought the power loss
would cause the dome to fail,

33:34.480 --> 33:37.880
but the computer found a way
to compensate. The dome is shrinking.

33:37.960 --> 33:42.600
That's what happened to the MALP. It's
where we left it, but now on the outside.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.560
Wait a minute.

33:44.640 --> 33:49.360
If there were over 100,000 people
living here, where did they all go?

34:06.800 --> 34:08.600
O'Neill.

34:25.440 --> 34:31.440
There are other remains, but the bones
have been eaten by the corrosive air.

34:42.440 --> 34:45.840
I understand why
you're reluctant to believe us, Pallan.

34:45.920 --> 34:49.960
Things in your head must seem like
memories of a lifetime, but they're not.

34:50.040 --> 34:53.760
Yesterday you didn't know disconnecting
from the Link could be fatal.

34:53.840 --> 34:57.320
- You're lying.
- These documents are over 400 years old.

34:57.400 --> 35:01.800
They're in your language. How could we
fake this? Why would we fake this?

35:01.880 --> 35:05.840
They only exist because the computer
did not foresee outside interference.

35:05.920 --> 35:09.440
- To anyone on the Link, they're irrelevant.
- But why?

35:09.520 --> 35:12.440
The computer is programmed
to maintain the community.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.320
Individuals were sacrificed
for the good of the whole,

35:15.400 --> 35:20.480
only each time someone vanished no one
noticed because all memory was erased.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.560
Please.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.560
No.

35:25.640 --> 35:28.480
- It's all right.
- No.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.560
I...

35:36.640 --> 35:38.920
You see?

35:41.280 --> 35:43.760
Now we need your help.

35:47.560 --> 35:51.440
<i>- What's your status?
- Pallan's trying to access the Link.</i>

35:51.520 --> 35:55.920
- We might be able to reprogram it.
- Understood. We're coming to you.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.040
- What did I do?
- It's another update.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.600
Nevin, I want you to stay here.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.400
Father?

36:25.480 --> 36:27.880
Is Colonel O'Neill sick?

36:27.960 --> 36:31.320
Yes, but we're gonna make him better.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.920
What is it?

37:05.000 --> 37:09.560
These systems are so complicated.
I'm not sure I know what I'm doing.

37:09.640 --> 37:11.880
You've been doing this your whole life.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.080
You just have to try
to remember the old-fashioned way.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.960
Right.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.480
- Maybe not that way.
- Agreed.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.440
Let's keep moving.

37:42.880 --> 37:47.320
- Carter, we may have a problem.
- They're controlled by the computer, sir.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.600
O'Neill.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.280
Hey.

38:10.680 --> 38:14.560
Everything's gonna be all right, Colonel.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.640
These are for you.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.560
I don't think so.

38:22.840 --> 38:27.080
You've been disconnected from the Link.
You're not well.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.160
Let us help you.

38:30.280 --> 38:33.160
Carter, now would be a good time.

38:38.720 --> 38:43.960
- I'm in. What do I tell them?
- There's no time to explain everything.

38:44.040 --> 38:47.120
Try to erase all memory of us completely.

38:54.880 --> 38:58.480
- Don't make me shoot you.
- You're not yourself, Colonel.

38:58.560 --> 39:01.600
Without the Link,
your mind is playing tricks on you.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.360
Who are you?

39:45.720 --> 39:47.720
I did it.

40:08.960 --> 40:12.560
We ran tests on the geothermal vents
that supply the town's power.

40:12.640 --> 40:15.120
They started to cool about 200 years ago.

40:15.200 --> 40:19.240
The dome started shrinking
some time after that.

40:19.320 --> 40:24.080
We should have the whole town
relocated in a couple of days.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.760
I think I'm going to miss this garden.

40:26.840 --> 40:30.600
- How much longer'll the force field last?
- It's difficult to say.

40:30.680 --> 40:35.120
Even with less surface area to maintain,
power would have failed eventually.

40:35.200 --> 40:39.400
And in the meantime,
more of us would have disappeared.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.160
You still don't remember her, do you?

40:42.240 --> 40:43.640
No.

40:44.560 --> 40:47.200
You know, in a way, I envy the others.

40:47.280 --> 40:52.240
They all must have lost somebody,
but I'm the only one who knows for sure.

40:52.320 --> 40:56.840
How do you mourn someone
when you can't even picture her face?

40:56.920 --> 41:00.120
I'm sorry, Pallan. I wish I could help.
