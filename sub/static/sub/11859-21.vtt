WEBVTT

00:19.208 --> 00:22.375
Come on. Of all the shots
you leave me with cross side.

00:22.458 --> 00:24.125
I'm screwed.

00:24.208 --> 00:26.792
You know, so-called
experts stroll in here

00:26.875 --> 00:30.417
"Hey, angle this, angle that."
Blah, blah, blah.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.750
'You know what pool is
most of the time?'

00:32.834 --> 00:34.041
Luck.

00:35.375 --> 00:37.083
'And I definitely
don't have it!'

00:37.166 --> 00:38.875
Thanks a lot, cue ball.
I don't need to win.

00:38.959 --> 00:41.125
Why don't you lay smack next
to the eight there?

00:43.417 --> 00:44.917
Right where
you want him, Duke.

00:47.125 --> 00:48.333
Okay, come on

00:52.250 --> 00:54.291
Would you look at that?
Boy, oh, boy.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.166
Bartender, couple of
shots
of Jack for me

00:56.250 --> 00:58.083
and the
hustler
over here.

00:58.166 --> 00:59.667
Come on, let's roll again.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.583
What do you say, $75?

01:02.834 --> 01:03.875
Oh..

01:05.834 --> 01:09.500
- $150 for the rack?
- $150? Oh, I don't know.

01:09.583 --> 01:11.792
Alright, forget it.

01:11.875 --> 01:13.291
Hey, you know what?
Why not?

01:13.375 --> 01:15.125
I'm feeling lucky,
like you said.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.917
'Oh, by the way..'

01:18.000 --> 01:21.250
...lemme introduce myself.
I'm The Duke.

01:26.375 --> 01:27.583
I know who you are.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.250
So many to choose from.

01:33.333 --> 01:34.542
(male #1)
Corner.

01:37.709 --> 01:38.834
'Side.'

01:39.959 --> 01:41.667
What the hell?
Cross bank?

01:43.583 --> 01:47.500
[chuckling]
I am just so damn lucky.

01:47.583 --> 01:48.834
'By the way, Duke'

01:48.917 --> 01:50.500
my name's Patrick Lennox.

01:50.583 --> 01:52.250
And you can tell all
the other yuks

01:52.333 --> 01:54.917
in Mayberry that they gotta
come see the Rifle.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.500
Shoots fast, never misses.

02:00.083 --> 02:01.959
Think you're top dog
at the table, do ya?

02:02.041 --> 02:03.333
Yes, ma'am, I do.

02:03.417 --> 02:06.125
The great Baltimore
Red's
got nothing on me.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.375
I'd get going,
if I was you.

02:10.959 --> 02:14.333
My friends, I
bid
<i>adieu.</i>

02:25.125 --> 02:27.417
(male reporter over TV)
'As we told you a moment ago'

02:27.500 --> 02:30.250
'President Kennedy
was assassinated'

02:30.333 --> 02:32.667
'in Dallas, Texas today.'

02:32.750 --> 02:36.291
'He was shot in Dallas at 12:25'

02:36.375 --> 02:37.667
'as his car proceeded'

02:37.750 --> 02:40.709
'through the crowded
streets of Dallas.'

02:40.792 --> 02:45.208
'From John John to his father,
a last salute.'

02:56.083 --> 02:57.542
Gamblers with sticks

02:57.625 --> 02:59.875
it's a dangerous
combination.

02:59.959 --> 03:02.625
New owner's got evidence
on a Patrick Lennox

03:02.709 --> 03:05.000
a pool hustler, killed
the same day as Kennedy.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.417
Lennox was known
as "The Rifle".

03:06.500 --> 03:08.750
Cut down before
getting his
picture

03:08.834 --> 03:10.000
on Whitey's wall of fame.

03:10.083 --> 03:11.959
Are we gonna see
your mug up here, Boss?

03:12.041 --> 03:14.250
Don't, I wish.
Perhaps,
Wimpy Lassiter.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.834
Back in the day,
Whitey's
was famous for pool

03:16.917 --> 03:19.542
gambling and police raids.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.000
And who's that?

03:21.083 --> 03:24.417
- Baltimore Red.
- Any of 'em have real names?

03:24.500 --> 03:27.625
Legend was he'd run
15 racks in Hoboken

03:27.709 --> 03:29.333
then do it in
Skokie
a day later.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.375
Nobody knew where he was from,
who he was. Real mystery man.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.250
They say Lennox was supposed to
play him right here at Whitey's

03:35.333 --> 03:37.542
night before he died,
but neither of 'em
showed.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.500
Scotty, Lil,
Tom Puckett.

03:39.583 --> 03:41.041
He's bringing Whitey's
back to life.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.542
Open next week.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.458
That's, of course, if my
liquor
license comes through.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.208
Let's see what
you got first, buddy.

03:46.291 --> 03:48.250
Found it shoved way back
in a cue holder.

03:48.333 --> 03:49.792
(Tom)
When I saw the date
on the newspaper

03:49.875 --> 03:52.291
it was wrapped in,
I figured..

03:52.375 --> 03:55.125
- A .32 snub nose.
- Excuse me for a second.

03:55.208 --> 03:58.583
The ME report says this
Rifle
was killed with a .32.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.125
- One shot.
- Got a spent casing.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.542
Only fired one.

04:02.625 --> 04:06.917
"Kennedy Shot In Dallas,
November 22, 1963."

04:07.000 --> 04:08.917
Papers ran five
or six extra editions

04:09.000 --> 04:10.166
'the day of the assassination.'

04:10.250 --> 04:11.959
This one went out at 3:00 p.m.

04:12.041 --> 04:16.125
It matches up. ME listed time
of death approximately 2:00
P.M.

04:16.208 --> 04:17.709
He was killed in Chestnut Hill.

04:17.792 --> 04:21.208
What's a pool hustler
doing over in la-di-da
land?

04:21.291 --> 04:22.625
There's nothin' in the file.

04:22.709 --> 04:24.667
Why's no one say squat
about it for 40 years?

04:24.750 --> 04:28.000
Hustlers and cops, Scotty.
Not exactly bosom buddies.

04:28.083 --> 04:30.375
Or maybe the Rifle
hustled the wrong shark?

04:30.458 --> 04:32.041
And it earned
him the
bullet.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.125
A gunshot wound to the back.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.041
It was a .32 caliber
round recovered.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.792
Ballistics says
body bullet matches

05:14.875 --> 05:16.208
the revolver
from Whitey's.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.709
Huh, got our murder weapon.

05:17.792 --> 05:20.709
And surprise, surprise.
No registered owner on the gun.

05:20.792 --> 05:22.041
I'll contact
the manufacturer.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.458
Maybe, they know
who the dealer was.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.500
A motel key in
Lennox's
pocket led assigned

05:25.583 --> 05:27.417
to the Broad Street Motel.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.875
Manager ID'd him
from the
registries.

05:29.959 --> 05:31.959
No address listed.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.458
Bunch of train ticket
stubs on him.

05:34.542 --> 05:39.250
Detroit, Pittsburgh, Trenton.
All about a month apart.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.250
(Valens)
'Arrives in Philly
November 1.'

05:41.333 --> 05:43.917
Gets a match with this
Baltimore Red on the 21st.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.291
Supposed to happen at Whitey's,
but neither of 'em shows.

05:46.375 --> 05:49.417
Yeah, body found 14
hours
later in Chestnut Hill.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.834
Police canvassed
the neighborhood.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.250
There were no witnesses.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.917
It was broad
daylight.
No one sees nothing?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.875
Half an hour after
Kennedy's shot?

05:55.959 --> 05:57.917
Everyone's glued to their TV's.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.750
In three gunshots,
the '60s begun.

06:00.834 --> 06:04.875
I was playing touch
football at recess.

06:04.959 --> 06:06.208
Recess?

06:06.291 --> 06:09.041
Thought you were, like,
45
when that happened.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.041
You're thinking
of when Lincoln was shot.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.750
Keep it up.
See what happens.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.333
Boss was right.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.291
Whitey's was the raid capital
of Philly back in the day.

06:19.375 --> 06:23.083
Lennox was busted there for
bookmaking, November 3, 1963.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.625
Couple of weeks before
he was murdered.

06:24.709 --> 06:27.417
- 'It could be related.'
- Check this out.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.709
Clerk listed a local guy,
John Norwood bailing him out.

06:30.792 --> 06:33.333
Puckett says this Norwood guy
was a fixture at Whitey's.

06:33.417 --> 06:34.542
In the day, he coached
younger players.

06:34.625 --> 06:35.709
Can we get a line on him?

06:35.792 --> 06:38.041
Livin' it up at
Green Acres Retirement.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.875
Vera and Minnesota Skinny are
on their way to see him now.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.125
John Norwood?

06:48.208 --> 06:50.291
Sure am.
Who's asking?

06:50.375 --> 06:52.125
Philly Homicide.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.917
You hung out
at Whitey's in '63?

06:54.000 --> 06:58.625
In '64, '65, '66.
Place was a goldmine.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.166
- How about Patrick Lennox?
- 'Lennox?'

07:01.250 --> 07:02.834
Never heard of him.

07:02.917 --> 07:05.542
You got a habit of bailing guys
out of jail you never heard of?

07:06.709 --> 07:09.291
Oh, that guy.
I bailed him out, sure.

07:10.458 --> 07:12.500
Kid had the mortal nuts.

07:12.583 --> 07:15.041
A great stick with no fear.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.542
But his game was flawed.
Shame he got killed.

07:17.625 --> 07:19.000
What can you
tell
us about that?

07:19.083 --> 07:21.208
Nothing, really.
It was a long time ago.

07:21.291 --> 07:23.166
Well, maybe you can
remember where you were

07:23.250 --> 07:24.625
when JFK got shot?

07:24.709 --> 07:28.041
- Am I a suspect in that,
too?
- Ain't decided yet.

07:28.125 --> 07:31.667
Look, I was at Whitey's
watching Cronkite all day.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.667
Give you names,
you don't believe me.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.166
After you bailed Lennox out

07:35.250 --> 07:36.667
you straighten
his game out, too?

07:36.750 --> 07:40.959
No...that kid was more trouble
than he was worth.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.917
You see Red, you tell him
the Rifle's in town.

07:55.583 --> 07:57.709
See how you got
your nickname.

07:57.792 --> 08:00.083
'But you bring that crap
to Baltimore Red'

08:00.166 --> 08:02.208
he'll knock
you
all over the
felt.

08:02.291 --> 08:03.417
You talking to me..

08:04.250 --> 08:05.125
...doctor?

08:05.208 --> 08:07.041
I's looking at you, ain't I?

08:07.125 --> 08:09.458
- You know Red?
- That ain't the point.

08:09.542 --> 08:11.375
He strolls in,
you better be
ready.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.834
He's the one
who better be ready.

08:12.917 --> 08:15.041
You don't have the game
to back the hustle.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.417
You're gonna get
your ass kicked

08:16.500 --> 08:18.166
and I don't mean
in the abstract.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.041
You're the guy who's
been watching me shoot.

08:21.417 --> 08:24.250
- Your name Norwood?
- I like "Doctor" better.

08:24.333 --> 08:25.709
You bailed me out.

08:26.959 --> 08:28.166
Look at the table.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.542
What's your third shot?

08:31.625 --> 08:33.500
Can't even answer that, huh?

08:33.583 --> 08:35.333
You gotta think bigger.

08:35.417 --> 08:37.083
You know what happens
when you see your third
shot?

08:37.166 --> 08:39.750
I don't care,
you bag of wind.

08:39.834 --> 08:41.417
I'll get there
when I get there.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.834
You stubborn bastard.

08:45.917 --> 08:49.750
Stop drinking like a boiled
owl and clean out your ears.

08:50.917 --> 08:53.000
- 'Hey, Monkey.'
- Hey.

09:03.291 --> 09:07.500
The only thing that kid left
me
with was a nickname, Doctor.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.417
Who's the guy that
turned
Lennox into a ghost?

09:09.500 --> 09:10.709
Monkey Mack.

09:10.792 --> 09:12.166
So, why was Lennox
running from him?

09:12.250 --> 09:15.542
They were partners
years before in Philly.

09:15.625 --> 09:18.583
Story was they hustled
the wrong stake-horse

09:18.667 --> 09:20.041
for a chunk of change.

09:20.125 --> 09:21.792
And after that,
Lennox left town?

09:21.875 --> 09:25.083
Left the stake-horse with two
arms to break instead of four.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.625
Where's Miller
with the gun?

09:27.709 --> 09:30.500
Manufacturer sold it
to a traveling gun show.

09:30.583 --> 09:33.125
Still in business. She's
checking to see who bought it.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.375
- Here you go, Will.
- Thanks, Lenny.

09:35.458 --> 09:38.709
Uh, can't be a harder
findin'
than this Baltimore Red.

09:38.792 --> 09:40.583
You check Baltimore?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.625
Yeah, good idea.

09:42.709 --> 09:46.375
Nobody uses that alias in
Baltimore or anywhere
else.

09:46.458 --> 09:49.917
Hey, how 'bout a little
hoagie
with that Tabasco sauce?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.500
Better than that bologna
situation you got going on.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.000
At least mine's got taste.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.458
Not that you would know.
Inhale
the whole damn thing anyway.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.166
Yeah, right. Alright.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.083
That Monkey Max,
a real tool.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.959
burglary, assault,
you name it.

10:02.041 --> 10:03.959
Sounds like a
regular
dumpster fire.

10:04.041 --> 10:05.166
Hmm, gets better.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.166
Genius was busted with
a .32, three times.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.458
Where's he now?

10:09.542 --> 10:11.583
Same place he spent
half his natural life.

10:20.583 --> 10:23.166
A name like Monkey,
life behind bars.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.375
Kind of a self-fulfilling
prophecy, ain't it?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.792
- Heard 'em all before.
- Not from Philly Homicide.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.458
Understand you had a score
to settle with Patrick Lennox

10:31.542 --> 10:32.834
November '63.

10:32.917 --> 10:35.000
Been settling scores
my whole life.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.375
The one with Lennox
ended with a .32.

10:37.458 --> 10:38.959
Your weapon of choice.

10:39.041 --> 10:42.875
Patrick ditched Philly after
some dame broke his heart.

10:42.959 --> 10:46.417
The punks that he screwed over,
they took it out on me.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.792
Got any names?

10:47.875 --> 10:51.208
Yeah, Jackass One
and Jackass Two.

10:51.291 --> 10:53.041
Hoping they're
both dead by now.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.041
Remember where you were
when Kennedy got shot?

10:55.125 --> 10:57.375
Praying to a porcelain god

10:57.458 --> 10:59.625
hung over like a sheet
on a clothesline.

10:59.709 --> 11:00.792
Not much of an alibi.

11:00.875 --> 11:02.417
You heard Lennox
was back in town.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.041
What happened
when you found him?

11:04.125 --> 11:06.917
Offered me a few shots of Beam,
spotted me five on a rack.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.583
It's water
under
the bridge.

11:08.667 --> 11:12.166
Besides, I wasn't the
only one looking for him.

11:14.542 --> 11:15.959
Cheers.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.834
To the jerk who swore
he'd never be back.

11:17.917 --> 11:20.750
I heard Red was
here last week.

11:20.834 --> 11:22.375
Baltimore Red?

11:22.458 --> 11:24.583
Yeah, right. You think
he's ever gonna play you?

11:24.667 --> 11:25.875
I'm tracking him down.

11:25.959 --> 11:27.834
Prove I ain't like
these other pool
bums.

11:27.917 --> 11:30.000
Always gotta be the best.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.625
Thought this was
a bad luck town.

11:31.709 --> 11:33.250
Yeah, when I beat him

11:33.333 --> 11:36.458
I ain't gonna have to
sweat
a measly 20 thou
anymore.

11:36.542 --> 11:37.834
Still dodging that debt?

11:39.709 --> 11:41.917
Rumor is Red only
runs two grand a game.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.417
Yeah, you know what?
I'll make that up in no
time.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.917
Ain't you
heard?
I'm the Rifle.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.500
No, no. Sorry, little
miss.
No kids allowed.

11:52.583 --> 11:54.291
Kid? I look older
than you, buddy.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.458
- 'Out.'
- But I'm here to see my dad.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.834
Oh, yeah? Which one of
these princes is your dad?

12:02.792 --> 12:03.834
Him.

12:05.083 --> 12:07.625
What? Sorry. Me?

12:07.709 --> 12:10.458
So, what, you have a..
You got a screw loose, kid?

12:10.542 --> 12:12.250
You're Patrick
Lennox,
ain't you?

12:13.542 --> 12:15.250
I'm Hill.
Hillary
Rhodes.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.208
Rhodes?

12:19.750 --> 12:21.625
That's Sandra.

12:21.709 --> 12:22.959
Here are the
letters
you wrote her.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.208
Knocked her up
right before you
guys

12:30.291 --> 12:31.834
took a
drive
to
splitsville

12:31.917 --> 12:34.250
Found them few months
before she died.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.250
- She's dead?
- Six months ago.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.208
She never told
you about me?

12:40.750 --> 12:43.500
This really is
a bad luck town.

12:46.500 --> 12:50.667
Sandra. The gift
that kept on giving.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.417
- Lennox take her in?
- Saw him shooting a week
later.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.875
Kid was still hanging
on his sleeve.

12:57.208 --> 12:59.625
Well, sit tight, Monkey.
Might be back.

12:59.709 --> 13:02.166
Well, Lennox comes back
to find Baltimore Red

13:02.250 --> 13:03.959
but Hillary
finds
him first.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.667
Two weeks later,
he's dead.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.125
Maybe, his bad luck had
nothing to do with pool.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.583
Not many people know
Patrick was my dad.

13:19.917 --> 13:21.083
He teach you to play?

13:22.333 --> 13:24.041
Laid a foundation, I guess.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.583
Dads are tricky.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.041
What they leave us with.

13:27.125 --> 13:29.166
Take what you can get, right?

13:29.250 --> 13:32.083
Still, best two
weeks
of my life.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.417
You were with him
the day he died?

13:33.500 --> 13:35.750
The night before,
until he left the
motel.

13:35.834 --> 13:37.250
I waited for
him
to come back.

13:37.333 --> 13:40.000
- But he never did.
- So, I went looking for
him.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.667
(man on TV)
'He was shot as he took
part in a Dallas motorcade'

13:46.750 --> 13:48.500
'which was driving him
to the Dallas..'

13:50.208 --> 13:53.208
(man on TV)
'The word we have
is that he is dead.'

13:53.291 --> 13:55.166
'He was shot by an assassin'

13:55.250 --> 13:59.083
'at the intersection
of Elm and Houston Street.'

14:00.792 --> 14:01.917
Sounds dumb.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.041
I thought they were
all
crying for my dad.

14:06.125 --> 14:07.208
You know where
he was headed?

14:07.291 --> 14:08.458
Heard a couple
of days later

14:08.542 --> 14:10.041
he had a match
with Baltimore
Red.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.709
- The match go down?
- Don't know.

14:11.792 --> 14:14.458
Split soon as the cops
started
sniffing around our room.

14:14.542 --> 14:16.750
Anyone else you can think
of might have been angry

14:16.834 --> 14:18.041
at your dad?

14:18.125 --> 14:20.500
- Guys he owed money to, maybe?
- Not guys.

14:20.583 --> 14:23.542
Was the opposite sex who
wanted his head on a
platter.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.000
I like this hotel.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.583
- Can we stay here?
- Motel.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.959
- Don't get used to it.
- Too late.

14:30.041 --> 14:32.417
But you're only here
till I get a run at Red.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.834
And then I'm gone.
You're on your own.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.417
You've been saying
that
every five minutes

14:36.500 --> 14:37.709
since I got here.

14:37.792 --> 14:40.458
Admit it, you like me.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.458
What I like is that
a hustler sees you

14:42.542 --> 14:44.792
and thinks I'm some
sap ham-and-egger.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.166
Lets his guard down.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.500
So, where's my cut?

14:47.583 --> 14:48.625
Cut?

14:50.500 --> 14:53.250
All you did was yell at me,
"You stink, Dad!"

14:53.333 --> 14:56.709
And besides, I still need 400
bucks before I can play Red.

14:58.875 --> 15:01.500
- Gonna need me to get it.
- Oh..

15:08.458 --> 15:09.917
Five bucks?

15:10.000 --> 15:13.041
I would do cartwheels if someone
gave me five bucks at your age.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.542
You sticky-finger this
at the Five And Dime?

15:19.625 --> 15:23.625
- So?
- Well...stealing is bad.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.041
Pittsburgh's a drag.

15:30.125 --> 15:31.458
Next time we gotta
land a mark

15:31.542 --> 15:33.458
ain't such a chatterbox
like The Duke.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.166
- Who's the brat?
- His daughter.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.250
- Who's the tramp?
- Daughter?

15:40.333 --> 15:43.166
You buy that
for her, Patrick?

15:43.250 --> 15:45.000
No, she stole it.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.375
Don't lie, Daddy.

15:47.458 --> 15:50.208
You got it at
Wanamaker's
after you won today.

15:50.291 --> 15:51.959
- Give me that.
- Don't pick on the kid.

15:52.041 --> 15:53.291
- Give it back.
- It's mine.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.333
I sat on a Greyhound
for six hours.

15:55.417 --> 15:56.583
Thought you had
a lead on Red.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.291
This isn't Pittsburgh, Blondie.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.041
Your good looks are not gonna
distract the shooter like Red.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.959
And neither will
a scamp kid.

16:09.959 --> 16:11.250
She was mean.

16:11.333 --> 16:14.417
Ready to take me out
over a two-dollar
trinket.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.625
Catch a name?

16:17.125 --> 16:20.333
Sharon something. He
called
her Blondie, mostly.

16:20.417 --> 16:21.959
She was a poor man's
Marilyn Monroe.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.500
Fake mole
and
everything.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.375
- He ever see her again?
- Don't know.

16:25.458 --> 16:26.709
But if she
did
that to me

16:26.792 --> 16:28.375
I can only imagine
what she would've done

16:28.458 --> 16:30.041
to my dad for
cutting her
out.

16:37.542 --> 16:38.834
Not bad.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.000
We got this case.

16:44.083 --> 16:47.333
A guy was killed practically
the same time as Kennedy.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.458
I was 19.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.542
Remember it like
it was yesterday.

16:51.625 --> 16:54.750
- Where were you?
- On a construction site.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.750
Then there was Ruby
and the funeral.

16:57.834 --> 16:59.667
Thought the
world
was ending.

17:03.417 --> 17:05.250
Hello?

17:05.333 --> 17:06.417
Oh, hi.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.208
Uh, yeah.

17:09.291 --> 17:10.375
Hour or so.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.959
Yeah, okay.

17:13.041 --> 17:14.750
Bye-bye.

17:16.250 --> 17:17.333
Sorry.

17:20.041 --> 17:21.959
They don't know about me?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.166
My family?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.500
They do. Just not, uh..

17:27.083 --> 17:30.709
- It's complicated.
- Complicated?

17:30.792 --> 17:32.041
Right.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.375
Lilly, listen.

17:34.542 --> 17:35.667
I gotta go.

17:36.458 --> 17:37.667
Lilly!

17:39.875 --> 17:41.375
Lilly!

17:44.208 --> 17:48.083
Baltimore Red. Wimpy
Lassiter.
The Rifle. Ridiculous.

17:48.166 --> 17:51.125
Every banger I tracked had
some kind of nickname, too.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.500
This one, Snoopy.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.166
Searched every
doghouse, outhouse.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.375
- Guess where I found him?
- Online dating?

17:58.625 --> 18:00.041
Dude was pumping
gas next to me.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.792
Big old Snoopy
medallion
around his neck.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.834
I'm beginning to wonder if
this
Baltimore Red really exists.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.375
- Like hunting down Godot.
- Who?

18:08.458 --> 18:10.333
Guess that one passed you
by.
It's a play.

18:10.417 --> 18:12.583
(Jeffries)
'Since when did you
start reading plays?'

18:12.667 --> 18:15.333
Since Ms. Kipplebottom told me
I'd never amount to anything

18:15.417 --> 18:17.208
if I didn't ace my final exam.

18:17.291 --> 18:18.625
Served you well.

18:18.709 --> 18:21.667
Since the police test is
chock-full of theater
questions.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.375
Miller, got something
for you.

18:24.458 --> 18:27.083
A traveling gun dealer
faxed you a name.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.875
Larry Sidorski.

18:28.959 --> 18:31.291
Bought his .32 at a show
in Maryland in '61.

18:31.375 --> 18:33.333
Can't be our doer,
though.
Talked with his ex.

18:33.417 --> 18:34.500
He was on a ship

18:34.583 --> 18:36.166
for the Merchant
Marines
when Kennedy was shot.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.500
So, it was stolen or
he gave it to
someone.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.417
Well, I'll hit up ATF
and Staties in Maryland

18:40.500 --> 18:41.667
help track him down.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.792
You guys talk to any
Sharons
while you were out?

18:43.875 --> 18:46.542
Rush is looking for the poor
man's Marilyn, mole and all.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.458
Sharon Lertola.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.750
Picked up in a raid
ten days before the murder.

19:03.625 --> 19:06.709
you remember
November 22, 1963?

19:06.792 --> 19:09.166
I can barely remember
my orders from this
morning.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.458
Day Kennedy was shot.

19:11.542 --> 19:12.625
Oh.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.417
I went to a picture.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.333
<i>"It's a Mad Mad</i>
<i>Mad Mad World."</i>

19:17.417 --> 19:19.709
And the usher came in
halfway through

19:19.792 --> 19:21.250
and made the announcement.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.375
You hustle your way
into that theater?

19:23.458 --> 19:24.542
[scoffin
g]
No.

19:24.625 --> 19:25.959
I'd given that up by then.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.291
So, why'd you show up

19:27.375 --> 19:29.041
at Patrick's motel
room
two weeks earlier?

19:29.125 --> 19:31.750
Well, we were still
road agents at the time.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.667
I would get the men
to ante up

19:34.750 --> 19:36.083
and Patrick would
take them down.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.750
And then we'd meet up
in another town

19:37.834 --> 19:39.917
'if Patrick found action.'

19:40.000 --> 19:41.125
Good, honest living.

19:41.208 --> 19:43.583
We saw the world
the same way.

19:43.667 --> 19:47.000
One big joke on all
of life's pigeons.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.709
It made us great partners
while it lasted.

19:49.792 --> 19:53.625
- Two of you romantic?
- Oh, no. Strictly business.

19:53.709 --> 19:55.875
Patrick was top dog
at the table.

19:55.959 --> 19:57.917
I wanted to cash
in
as long I could.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.208
So, why'd you trade it in?

19:59.291 --> 20:01.917
Eh, lifestyle gets
old.
So, I quit.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.250
Way we heard it, Lennox was
the one cutting you out.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.166
[laughing]
Who told you that, his
kid?

20:08.250 --> 20:10.834
I know I'd be pissed,
I got bumped like that.

20:10.917 --> 20:13.500
Best thing that ever happened to
me, splitting from that two-bit.

20:13.583 --> 20:14.792
How so?

20:14.875 --> 20:18.709
Patrick always said that
Philly was a bad-luck town.

20:18.792 --> 20:21.709
Truth is, it was Patrick
who was bad luck.

20:40.041 --> 20:42.125
Could have ran it if you
cornered me few shots
back.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.375
That's my whole bank.

20:47.375 --> 20:48.792
Now, it's my bank.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.917
I like your
style,
Mr. Rifle.

21:04.333 --> 21:05.792
Check his heel.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.333
Three bucks?
That's all you got?

21:17.625 --> 21:21.667
Life of the hustle catches up
with everyone sooner or later.

21:21.750 --> 21:22.834
Who was the thug?

21:22.917 --> 21:25.417
Ben Scavo.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.792
But I don't know
who his flunky
was.

21:27.875 --> 21:29.834
He the guy Patrick
owed 20 grand to?

21:29.917 --> 21:31.166
I don't know.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.375
But I do know Patrick
wasn't the first one

21:33.458 --> 21:35.000
he'd wiped the floor with.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.917
Found Ben Scavo,
the thug who took down Lennox.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.291
Boxer over at Mason's Gym.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.875
Stroked out five years
ago, but look at this.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.709
Scavo's ring name
was Lightning.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.542
'And that right there
is Monkey Mack.'

21:46.625 --> 21:48.000
(Stillman)
Scavo's cut man.

21:48.083 --> 21:50.792
Well, he'd sure as hell know
where Lennox kept his stash.

21:50.875 --> 21:54.500
Sends Lightning after Lennox.
Retribution for the broken
arms.

21:54.583 --> 21:56.208
Problem is three bucks
ain't gonna get

21:56.291 --> 21:57.583
a Monkey off your back.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.250
Can't stand prosperity,
can you, Monkey?

22:03.333 --> 22:06.458
- About to make parole.
- And you lie to us.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.500
What're you talking
about? I never lie.

22:08.583 --> 22:11.041
You said the last time you saw
Lennox, things were all good.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.709
And left out the
part
how you set him up

22:12.792 --> 22:14.417
to be pummeled
by your boy
Scavo.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.709
- You didn't ask about that.
- Hey, don't hustle us,
Monkey.

22:18.792 --> 22:20.667
My life's a hustle, detective.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.083
Cry me a river.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.000
You send Scavo back in
for the knockout

22:24.083 --> 22:25.625
when he only
gets you three bucks?

22:25.709 --> 22:28.458
I didn't need to.
I got paid in the end.

22:32.083 --> 22:33.458
It's not enough for
you getting busted
up

22:33.542 --> 22:35.166
but it's
gonna
have to do.

22:35.250 --> 22:37.542
I never wanna see
your face again.

22:48.583 --> 22:49.875
Why do you play pool?

22:52.250 --> 22:56.834
Well...there's nothing
more important than pool.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.375
What about swimming pools?

22:59.875 --> 23:01.291
I'll tell you what, Hill.

23:01.375 --> 23:02.625
When I beat Red,
I'll take you swimming

23:02.709 --> 23:04.458
in the biggest
pool there is.

23:04.542 --> 23:06.834
See, I told
you
you liked me.

23:09.333 --> 23:10.458
Are you scared
when you play?

23:10.542 --> 23:12.458
Why you ask silly
stuff like that?

23:12.542 --> 23:13.959
I know you got
beat up, Dad.

23:15.083 --> 23:16.625
That's no way to live.

23:18.500 --> 23:21.458
All's you care about is
beating
this Baltimore Red guy?

23:24.291 --> 23:25.417
You're solids.

23:26.667 --> 23:27.792
What's your third shot?

23:29.875 --> 23:32.458
You know what happens when
you find your third shot?

23:32.542 --> 23:34.792
You see your fourth,
your fifth, your sixth

23:34.875 --> 23:36.291
your seventh,
and your eighth.

23:40.917 --> 23:42.041
Four ball.

23:44.583 --> 23:46.250
That'd be my third shot.

23:49.792 --> 23:52.625
You know, I really
liked your ma.

23:52.709 --> 23:54.792
I know.

23:54.875 --> 23:56.250
Last thing she said
to me, letting you

23:56.333 --> 23:58.208
go was the worst
mistake of her
life.

24:09.792 --> 24:11.458
Why do you look over
your shoulder like that?

24:12.875 --> 24:15.500
And what is with
this face this..?

24:16.875 --> 24:19.667
[laughing]
That's what you
do.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.834
Even when you win, you
look
like you're mad as hell.

24:30.375 --> 24:32.083
Why'd your ma
name you Hill?

24:32.166 --> 24:35.000
She won money off of Hill
Gail
in the Kentucky Derby

24:35.083 --> 24:37.083
couple of weeks
before
she had me.

24:37.166 --> 24:38.667
'Said I was lucky.'

24:38.750 --> 24:40.709
Lucky Hill.

24:40.792 --> 24:44.125
- That horse was a boy.
- She wanted a boy, okay?

24:46.250 --> 24:49.083
- Are you sure it was the
Derby?
- Mm-hmm.

24:49.166 --> 24:50.208
Why?

24:52.834 --> 24:53.959
Never mind.

24:55.291 --> 24:56.542
Take your shot.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.291
Seemed like a cool kid.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.417
Even Whitey didn't care
if she hung around.

25:03.500 --> 25:07.125
This technique he was teaching,
third shot, looking ahead

25:07.208 --> 25:08.208
that his thing?

25:08.291 --> 25:10.834
He must have learned
that somewhere.

25:10.917 --> 25:13.083
Really picked up his
game
the last few weeks.

25:13.166 --> 25:15.083
He working with anyone
you knew about?

25:15.166 --> 25:16.250
No.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.375
Only saw him with the kid.

25:18.458 --> 25:21.000
Acted like he didn't
give a rat's ass

25:21.083 --> 25:23.917
but she really got to him.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.959
Hello, Doctor, I was
wondering
if you could teach me

25:27.041 --> 25:28.583
one of those trick
shots
you mentioned.

25:28.667 --> 25:30.834
It would be great
to impress the
crew.

25:30.917 --> 25:32.458
I got one for you.

25:36.667 --> 25:38.625
This will make 'em flip.

25:38.709 --> 25:41.959
Hit the cue right here, hard.
You'll clear the table.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.208
Bend your knees.

25:45.458 --> 25:48.750
Aw. Well, it takes practice.

25:48.834 --> 25:50.709
What is it,
three shots
ahead?

25:50.792 --> 25:52.542
Then you see your fourth,
fifth, and sixth?

25:54.208 --> 25:57.500
Figured this wasn't
just about pool.

25:57.583 --> 26:00.083
You coach Lennox. He beats Red.
You get a cut.

26:01.542 --> 26:02.959
How did you convince
him
to take you on?

26:03.041 --> 26:08.375
Didn't. He came to me after
losing to some house player.

26:08.458 --> 26:10.458
His whole outlook
was different.

26:10.542 --> 26:12.083
And you set the
match
up with Red?

26:12.166 --> 26:14.792
No. Somebody contacted Patrick.

26:14.875 --> 26:17.917
Said, "Be at Whitey's.
Red wants a match.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.041
Two-grand stake."

26:19.125 --> 26:21.417
- Who fronted the money?
- Don't know.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.458
Don't think Patrick
did either.

26:23.542 --> 26:24.750
Whole thing was a mystery.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.834
Why did you lie
about working with
him?

26:28.917 --> 26:32.000
My only job was to coach him.

26:32.083 --> 26:34.125
And I crossed the line.

26:34.208 --> 26:37.959
Table's slop. Tap the cue off
the rail, jaw it behind the
two.

26:38.041 --> 26:39.792
You don't safety
it,
he'll run you.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.208
Try it again.
It ain't easy.

26:56.458 --> 26:59.583
- Everything good, Paddy?
- Yeah.

26:59.667 --> 27:02.000
I was thinking about Red.

27:02.083 --> 27:04.291
Master the safety,
he won't know what hit him.

27:09.875 --> 27:12.166
Match is at midnight, Paddy.
I told you, no distractions.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.125
Hey, I thought we were
gonna get some burgers.

27:14.208 --> 27:16.667
- Get lost, kid.
- Get lost, kid. You get lost.

27:16.750 --> 27:18.458
I mean it.
Get outta here.

27:19.959 --> 27:22.750
- But, Dad..
- I'm done playing dad.

27:22.834 --> 27:24.458
Leave me alone.

27:34.792 --> 27:37.834
The look in that
kid's eyes.

27:37.917 --> 27:40.834
It was me who told him,
either the kid or the game.

27:42.041 --> 27:44.375
This was the
afternoon
of the match?

27:44.458 --> 27:46.917
November 21st.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.291
The last time I saw him.

27:50.291 --> 27:53.000
Not a day goes by I wouldn't
give my right arm

27:53.083 --> 27:55.291
to have someone around
who loves me

27:55.375 --> 27:57.417
as much as that
kid loved him.

28:00.333 --> 28:01.542
Hey.

28:02.875 --> 28:04.625
Want to shoot a quick one?

28:05.542 --> 28:07.041
Maybe, another time, Doctor.

28:13.583 --> 28:15.875
- Finished already?
- Halfway.

28:15.959 --> 28:17.417
Liked it
that
much, huh?

28:17.500 --> 28:21.583
If I was by a bush waiting
for you or Nick, I'd just
leave.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.417
You do know they're
waiting for God,
right?

28:23.500 --> 28:25.500
Is that what Ms. Kipplebottom
told you?

28:25.583 --> 28:27.583
Yeah, Figured out why Lennox
might have ditched the kid

28:27.667 --> 28:30.625
and it had nothing to
do
with Norwood's advice.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.000
Kentucky Derby?

28:32.083 --> 28:35.375
Race Hill Gail won two
weeks
before Hillary was born.

28:35.458 --> 28:37.000
Check the date.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.625
May 3, 1952.

28:38.709 --> 28:42.166
But Patrick left Philly for
the Coast Guard in June of
'51.

28:43.208 --> 28:44.583
That's an 11-month difference.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.291
Kid wasn't really his daughter.

28:47.375 --> 28:51.125
No, Hillary Rhodes was more of a
hustler than the Rifle himself.

28:55.583 --> 28:57.625
Got your birth certificate
from Vital Records.

28:58.834 --> 29:00.125
Want to read
that date to us?

29:01.792 --> 29:03.542
"May 18..

29:05.041 --> 29:06.417
...1952."

29:06.500 --> 29:10.625
11 months after Patrick
Lennox
entered the Coast Guard.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.166
Reason a lot of people
don't know

29:12.250 --> 29:14.667
he's your father, Hillary,
he isn't.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.166
Were you working
your own scam on him?

29:16.250 --> 29:17.542
What? No.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.208
11-year-old kid,
someone put you up to
it?

29:19.291 --> 29:20.500
Distract him
before the big
match?

29:20.583 --> 29:21.709
I would never
have done
that.

29:21.792 --> 29:23.375
You'd just lie about him
being your dad.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.792
(Stillman)
'What aren't you
telling us, Hillary?'

29:24.875 --> 29:26.333
Nothing.
I swear.

29:27.875 --> 29:29.625
I just wanted a father.

29:30.834 --> 29:32.417
But he didn't want me.

29:33.959 --> 29:35.041
Lied to us once.

29:35.125 --> 29:38.000
Please, what do
you
want from me?

29:38.083 --> 29:41.667
- The truth.
- I was gonna tell him. I
was.

29:41.750 --> 29:43.166
When, huh?

29:43.250 --> 29:45.458
What ten years from now?

29:45.542 --> 29:47.166
That crap you fed me
about your ma.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.417
She never said one word
about it, did she?

29:50.917 --> 29:53.208
Did she?

29:53.291 --> 29:55.875
No.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.000
Yeah?

30:09.041 --> 30:10.083
'Sure.'

30:10.959 --> 30:12.709
I'm on my way.

30:12.792 --> 30:16.041
It was the only way
you'd stay with me.

30:16.125 --> 30:18.333
Please don't leave.

30:18.417 --> 30:21.083
You don't be here
when I get back.

30:21.166 --> 30:22.542
'Please.'

30:22.625 --> 30:25.792
I got nowhere else to go.

30:44.625 --> 30:45.709
He drove away.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.625
I never saw him again.

30:49.709 --> 30:50.917
Who was that on the phone?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.625
I don't know.

30:55.125 --> 30:57.250
Dads are tricky.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.709
'What they leave us with.'

30:59.792 --> 31:03.083
Right, Detective Rush?

31:03.166 --> 31:05.250
At least I know
why he did it.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.875
I drove him away.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.291
Hey.

31:18.375 --> 31:19.291
You alright?

31:19.375 --> 31:20.625
I don't need this.

31:20.709 --> 31:22.458
Give it to someone else.

31:22.542 --> 31:23.750
Lilly.

31:25.375 --> 31:27.959
I've never been one
for the spiritual
mumbo-jumbo.

31:28.041 --> 31:29.542
Save it for one of your kids.

31:29.625 --> 31:31.625
Wait a minute.
I'm going to tell them, Lil.

31:31.709 --> 31:34.125
- Not trying to hide
anything--
- You think I care?

31:34.208 --> 31:37.458
I'm not asking you to
throw
some kind of reunion
picnic--

31:37.542 --> 31:39.208
Things don't happen overnight.
It takes time.

31:39.291 --> 31:40.667
For what?

31:40.750 --> 31:42.583
I'm not a mistake
you have to hide.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.750
It's not that simple.

31:44.834 --> 31:45.875
Forget it.

31:45.959 --> 31:49.625
You're a good guy,
and I wish you the
best.

31:49.709 --> 31:51.041
Don't you just
walk away now--

31:51.125 --> 31:52.625
No, that's your
act,
remember, Dad?

31:52.709 --> 31:53.667
Oh, here we go.

31:53.750 --> 31:56.291
You left me with her!

31:56.375 --> 31:58.041
You know what that was like?

31:58.125 --> 31:59.333
You bet I do.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.208
Then why didn't
you
take me with you?

32:01.291 --> 32:03.000
I did what I thought
was best for everyone.

32:03.083 --> 32:04.875
You did what was best for you.

32:04.959 --> 32:06.667
You give me some stupid medal.

32:06.750 --> 32:09.083
Play a couple of
games
of chess.

32:09.166 --> 32:10.125
Give me a break.

32:10.208 --> 32:12.250
Look, you came to me.

32:12.333 --> 32:13.417
You want to have a relationship?

32:13.500 --> 32:14.959
Some point we got to put
this behind us--

32:15.041 --> 32:16.208
This is how
you
want to do it

32:16.291 --> 32:17.750
your head in the
sand,
no, thanks.

32:17.834 --> 32:21.000
You're talking
about 30 years ago.

32:21.083 --> 32:22.709
You want me to dredge it all up?

32:22.792 --> 32:25.417
That what you're asking here?
Well, I'm not going to do it.

32:25.500 --> 32:29.917
There are things, some things,
that are not your damn
business.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.083
I'm not giving explanations.

32:32.166 --> 32:33.959
Worked a long time
to get where I am

32:34.041 --> 32:35.834
and I'm not going to dredge
it all up, you hear?

32:35.917 --> 32:38.166
Your mother-- damn it, if
that's
what you're looking for!

32:38.250 --> 32:40.125
Just say it!

32:40.208 --> 32:42.709
You were wrong.

32:42.792 --> 32:44.792
You want me to change the past?

32:46.625 --> 32:48.041
What happened happened.

32:48.125 --> 32:50.625
Well, it happened to me.

33:04.291 --> 33:07.834
Looked up Rolls-Royce
registrations in '63, two
hits.

33:07.917 --> 33:10.834
One in a car museum and one
owned by an Al Soddenheim.

33:10.917 --> 33:11.917
Guess where he lives.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.417
Chestnut Hill.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.875
Let's take a ride.

33:23.166 --> 33:24.667
(Nick)
'Al Soddenheim?'

33:24.750 --> 33:26.041
May I help you?

33:26.125 --> 33:27.291
I'll be damned.

33:27.375 --> 33:30.709
Baltimore Red lives
in Chestnut Hill.

33:31.625 --> 33:32.625
Drink?

33:32.709 --> 33:34.208
On the job.

33:34.291 --> 33:35.709
I never let that stop me.

33:35.792 --> 33:37.083
You know why we're here, Red?

33:37.166 --> 33:38.709
Well, let's see.

33:38.792 --> 33:40.583
Two homicide cops.

33:40.667 --> 33:43.250
An unsolved murder
from 40 years ago.

33:43.333 --> 33:46.542
I was a betting man I'd say it
has to do with Patrick Lennox.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.000
We know you picked him up

33:48.083 --> 33:50.250
at the Broad Street Motel
in your Rolls-Royce.

33:50.333 --> 33:52.000
That was my driver.

33:52.083 --> 33:53.417
Lennox was coming here to play.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.792
Why didn't you play at Whitey's?

33:54.875 --> 33:56.583
'Oh, once the word
of the match got out'

33:56.667 --> 33:59.458
Whitey could've hung up
a sign saying "Raids
Wanted".

33:59.542 --> 34:01.083
So, what happened?

34:01.166 --> 34:03.667
Lennox give
the great Baltimore Red

34:03.750 --> 34:05.125
more than he
could handle?

34:05.208 --> 34:07.875
I can tell you one
thing
about Patrick Lennox.

34:07.959 --> 34:10.166
He had some
tricks
up his sleeve.

34:12.834 --> 34:13.917
Thirsty?

34:14.000 --> 34:14.917
No.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.291
Let's just shoot.

34:17.375 --> 34:19.083
One game.

34:19.166 --> 34:21.333
2,000.

34:21.417 --> 34:23.083
Standard eight-ball.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.375
That's a nice shot.

35:13.417 --> 35:14.834
Double or nothing?

35:39.625 --> 35:40.542
You know, I must say

35:40.625 --> 35:42.792
never seen a man
up 40,000

35:42.875 --> 35:44.667
look so damn mad.

35:56.458 --> 35:57.750
Kid's right.

35:57.834 --> 35:59.959
'Excuse me?'

36:00.041 --> 36:02.041
This ain't no way to live.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.250
What are you doing?

36:05.333 --> 36:07.291
I'm done.

36:07.375 --> 36:08.750
I didn't call this match.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.542
I won, Red.

36:10.625 --> 36:11.667
I won.

36:15.166 --> 36:17.250
I walk now.

36:17.333 --> 36:20.208
I take 20,000
over the 40 you owe me.

36:20.291 --> 36:22.333
And nobody hears about this.

36:26.083 --> 36:29.625
Where do you have to be
that's more important than
this?

36:29.709 --> 36:32.041
I told somebody
I'd take them swimming.

36:37.834 --> 36:39.750
You forgot your cue!

36:39.834 --> 36:42.041
The only cue that ever beat me.

36:42.125 --> 36:43.709
You set up the match yourself?

36:43.792 --> 36:45.583
No, no.

36:45.667 --> 36:48.166
I received a sealed
envelope
from Whitey

36:48.250 --> 36:49.667
with an anonymous note.

36:49.750 --> 36:51.875
- Stake was inside.
- What'd it say?

36:51.959 --> 36:53.500
'Oh, something about, uh'

36:53.583 --> 36:56.959
top dog making me look silly.

36:57.041 --> 36:59.542
Bold, but prophetic.

37:00.667 --> 37:02.041
I had my own road partner once.

37:02.125 --> 37:06.041
We took off on his
bike,
didn't look back.

37:06.125 --> 37:08.125
We slept where we stopped.

37:08.208 --> 37:10.458
Made whatever coin we could.

37:10.542 --> 37:11.917
The world was our oyster.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.625
It wasn't like that
with me and Patrick.

37:13.709 --> 37:16.375
- We were strictly business.
- Sure, that's what you said.

37:17.875 --> 37:20.417
But it went deeper
than that, didn't it?

37:20.500 --> 37:22.291
A bond you develop
with someone on the road.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.709
At least till that kid
came skipping along.

37:24.792 --> 37:26.333
Crazy thing is..

37:26.417 --> 37:28.709
...Hillary Rhodes
wasn't even his.

37:28.792 --> 37:30.709
What?

37:30.792 --> 37:32.250
You didn't know?

37:32.333 --> 37:34.583
Yeah, she was just
looking for a
daddy.

37:34.667 --> 37:37.125
Guess the old Rifle was
looking for a kid, too.

37:37.208 --> 37:40.458
The question is, where'd
that leave you, Sharon?

37:43.083 --> 37:44.667
I was done with him anyway.

37:44.750 --> 37:47.041
Say, how'd you
describe
Patrick again?

37:47.125 --> 37:50.166
"Top bird at the table?"

37:50.250 --> 37:51.667
Dog.

37:51.750 --> 37:52.750
Top dog.

37:52.834 --> 37:54.208
I feel like I
heard
that before.

37:54.291 --> 37:57.166
Oh, in the note staking
Patrick's match

37:57.250 --> 37:58.834
with Baltimore Red,
wasn't it?

37:58.917 --> 38:01.166
Thought you didn't have
that kind of cash,
Sharon.

38:01.250 --> 38:02.458
I didn't. I..

38:02.542 --> 38:04.709
...I mean-I didn't
write any note.

38:04.792 --> 38:06.792
A lot of money, two grand.

38:06.875 --> 38:08.000
Don't know how you got it.

38:08.083 --> 38:10.667
But it couldn't
have been easy.

38:11.834 --> 38:13.166
'My money?'

38:13.250 --> 38:15.041
You thought if you scored
that match for him

38:15.125 --> 38:18.083
let him see he was
top dog for himself.

38:18.166 --> 38:20.291
You could win him back.

38:23.959 --> 38:26.834
You believed in him.

38:26.917 --> 38:28.709
I loved him.

38:28.792 --> 38:32.583
Remember a guy named
Larry Sidorski,
Sharon?

38:32.667 --> 38:35.417
Told us you hustled him
out of his .32 revolver.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.959
(Lilly)
'It's the same gun that
killed Patrick, Sharon.'

38:38.041 --> 38:39.583
No.

38:39.667 --> 38:41.875
Name's in the theft report.

38:41.959 --> 38:44.000
Got it right here.

38:47.792 --> 38:50.500
I never wanted to hurt him.

38:50.583 --> 38:52.041
(Lilly)
'But he wanted out.'

38:52.125 --> 38:54.542
He was done with the life.

38:54.625 --> 38:58.041
Wanted to be some
sap, ham and egger.

38:58.125 --> 39:01.000
But you couldn't
leave the hustle.

39:03.875 --> 39:07.583
There was nothing
else
for me to do.

39:08.375 --> 39:10.041
Patrick!

39:10.125 --> 39:11.166
Patrick!

39:13.917 --> 39:15.917
Blondie?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.959
What are you, uh...
what are you doing
here?

39:18.041 --> 39:19.250
I've been waiting all night.

39:19.333 --> 39:23.250
Saw you get picked up,
hopped in a cab.

39:23.333 --> 39:24.458
Did you beat him?

39:24.542 --> 39:27.041
Where's your cue?
He won your cue?

39:27.125 --> 39:29.625
I beat him for 40,000.

39:29.709 --> 39:31.250
I knew you were top dog!

39:31.333 --> 39:32.583
I only took 20.

39:32.667 --> 39:37.291
Gonna pay my debts,
start clean.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.125
Start clean?

39:39.208 --> 39:40.792
Where you going?

39:40.875 --> 39:42.458
Back to the motel.

39:42.542 --> 39:44.041
What's at the motel?

39:44.125 --> 39:45.834
- Hill.
- The kid?

39:45.917 --> 39:47.834
This ain't no life for her.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.291
What about me?

39:49.375 --> 39:52.333
I'm tired of checking ticket
stubs to remember where I
slept.

39:52.417 --> 39:54.667
But you make fun of all
those dull clock-punchers

39:54.750 --> 39:56.417
with nothing to live for.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.542
The joke's on them.

39:57.625 --> 39:59.375
The joke's on us.

39:59.458 --> 40:02.125
We're the ones
who got
nothing.

40:02.208 --> 40:03.291
Okay.

40:03.375 --> 40:05.959
The kid's part of the package.

40:06.041 --> 40:08.208
I can do that.
We'll hit the road--

40:08.291 --> 40:12.834
Come on, Blondie. You don't got
a maternal bone in your body.

40:12.917 --> 40:15.166
I'm taking her away,
finding something
better.

40:15.250 --> 40:18.500
But you're the Rifle.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.333
Not anymore.

40:21.667 --> 40:25.500
Who the hell you think
set up that match?

40:25.583 --> 40:27.208
You put up the money?

40:29.417 --> 40:30.667
How?

40:30.750 --> 40:33.041
I did what I had to.

40:37.083 --> 40:40.667
Uh..

40:40.750 --> 40:42.667
Here.

40:42.750 --> 40:44.583
Take five thousand.

40:48.375 --> 40:50.250
You're not walking
away from this.

40:51.166 --> 40:54.458
Go back and finish the game!

40:56.750 --> 40:59.083
The game's over, Sharon.

41:31.458 --> 41:32.792
[male reporter over radio]
'As we told you a moment ago'

41:32.875 --> 41:33.875
'President Kennedy--'

41:33.959 --> 41:35.417
Somebody shot him!

41:35.500 --> 41:37.625
I can't believe
they shot him!

41:37.709 --> 41:40.041
'He was shot at 12:45'

41:40.125 --> 41:43.959
'as his car proceeded through
the crowded streets of
Dallas.'

41:44.041 --> 41:48.166
'He died 35 minutes later
in the Dallas..'
