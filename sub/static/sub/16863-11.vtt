00:00.890 --> 00:02.290
Previously on "rescue me"...

00:02.320 --> 00:04.140
Do you want to have sex with me,or not?

00:04.180 --> 00:07.680
You're saying that you want to have
sex with me with no strings attached.

00:07.710 --> 00:10.850
I want you to promise...

00:10.880 --> 00:15.300
That you are never gonna make
love to me and her on the same day.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.430
Ok.

00:16.460 --> 00:18.510
- Candy.
- Who's your friend,lou?

00:18.540 --> 00:22.040
Oh,just a lovely young lady that
blew into my life a couple years ago

00:22.060 --> 00:24.160
and took about $26,000 of my money.

00:24.180 --> 00:26.300
Bottom line,tommy,we're
just both a couple of drunks.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.980
Yeah,but I'm a higher-ranking
drunk than you,so

00:29.010 --> 00:32.970
if aa was like an army,I'd be a
5-star general,and you're just a grunt.

00:32.990 --> 00:34.610
You're freaked out.

00:34.630 --> 00:36.940
So,like,where'd you learn
how to do all that stuff?

00:36.960 --> 00:38.350
Hey,ma,listen.

00:38.380 --> 00:41.610
The doctors think that they can stop the
cancer from spreading if they cut out my kidney.

00:41.630 --> 00:43.910
I'm gonna need you to come
to new york,ma,and be with me.

00:43.930 --> 00:47.890
So,I think we should
just get down and dirty

00:47.910 --> 00:53.100
and do all that
nasty,filthy,slutty,whorey,skanky,animalistic--

00:53.120 --> 00:54.990
You think I'm a whore?

01:02.560 --> 01:03.980
Hey!

01:04.000 --> 01:05.269
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.470
How the hell are you,pal?

01:07.490 --> 01:09.650
Great. He's drinking again?

01:09.670 --> 01:12.540
Like a kennedy on election day.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.130
- That's great.
- Wow,look at that sky.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.850
Let me look at you,kid.

01:16.870 --> 01:18.540
Oh,god,you look great.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.670
- What is that,aqua velva?
- No.I don't wear aqua velva.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.140
Oh,it's me.

01:23.170 --> 01:26.280
- Goddamn it,I smell great.
- Yeah.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.440
Mike,shawn,how you doing,kiddo?

01:29.460 --> 01:31.260
Come here,you guys.

01:31.280 --> 01:33.270
We're late. We got to get going.

01:33.290 --> 01:36.860
Whatever.He's happy,and
the bushmills didn't hurt.

01:36.870 --> 01:38.620
That's right.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.490
I love you.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.150
I'm at the V.A.Hospital.

01:42.180 --> 01:44.780
I'm looking after this
old vet on his deathbed,

01:44.790 --> 01:47.940
and he's still got some stuff
he wants to get off his chest,

01:47.950 --> 01:50.070
so I bring in his estranged son.

01:50.090 --> 01:52.840
The man needed closure before he died,

01:52.860 --> 01:54.910
and I helped facilitate it for him.

01:54.940 --> 01:59.680
I don't know what's more bizarre,
the fact that he's drinking again or

01:59.710 --> 02:02.400
the fact that you just used the word
"facilitate" and you used it correctly.

02:02.420 --> 02:04.300
Oh,I'm using lots
of big words,tom--

02:04.330 --> 02:07.130
"facilitate," "revelation."

02:07.160 --> 02:10.710
The point is,this situation got
me thinking about your dad again

02:10.729 --> 02:13.340
and how I never got right
with him before he passed,

02:13.370 --> 02:15.920
so I asked mickey for the
dvd,the old home movies,

02:15.960 --> 02:17.720
- you know,ones we all watched together.
- Right.

02:17.750 --> 02:20.060
Well,I put it in the machine,

02:20.090 --> 02:22.810
and I poured two big bushmills,

02:22.840 --> 02:26.500
and then I drank
real slow like,and--

02:26.530 --> 02:29.430
get ready for the
next surprise--voila.

02:29.460 --> 02:32.110
- You learned a french word.
- No,no,no.

02:32.140 --> 02:34.660
I started bawling my eyes out,

02:34.680 --> 02:37.670
and I'm not talking about
a few whimpers or sniffles.

02:37.700 --> 02:41.530
I'm talking about a
personal goddamn katrina,

02:41.560 --> 02:43.830
and then suddenly it happened.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.300
Instead of crying over
how much I missed him,

02:46.330 --> 02:48.470
I started laughing my ass off

02:48.500 --> 02:53.500
for all the great times me
and your father had together!

02:53.530 --> 02:55.970
-
-And then from that point on,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.180
I was gonna go tell everyone
just how much i loved him,

02:59.200 --> 03:01.130
- including you,tom.
- Yeah?

03:01.160 --> 03:02.570
- I love you.
- Yeah.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.860
No,tom. I really love you.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.610
I mean it. I love you
the shit out of you.

03:06.630 --> 03:09.530
I do,and I'm glad as
hell. God,I love you.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.420
I love you. I love you.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.450
Yeah. Ok.Ok.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.820
We got to go see eddie.

03:13.850 --> 03:16.110
I got to tell him how much i love him.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.830
- We better stop and get another bottle.
- Let's go,baby.

03:18.860 --> 03:19.560
Ok.

03:19.580 --> 03:21.480
- Jump in.
- # I love everybody #

03:21.500 --> 03:23.230
# she loves everybody #

03:23.260 --> 03:24.960
# I love everybody #

03:24.990 --> 03:27.500
- oh,we love somebody
- Hold on,baby.

03:27.530 --> 03:28.810
- See you later.
- Let's go,ellie.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.080
Hit it.

03:33.230 --> 03:36.330
- Was that-- -
Oh!Jesus christ.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.340
Teddy had a revelation.

03:38.370 --> 03:39.990
- Revelation,huh?
- Yeah.

03:40.010 --> 03:41.660
I used to drink those.

03:41.670 --> 03:42.980
You ever have an epiphany?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.970
Oh,no,too much
absinthe,endless hangover.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.240
Yeah.

03:47.260 --> 03:50.310
Do me a favor. Do I have any spit on me?

03:51.450 --> 03:53.120
Ok. See the spot right here?

03:53.140 --> 03:55.750
That's the only spot you
don't have spit on you.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.540
Put it that way.
- Yeah.Well,

03:58.560 --> 04:03.680
anyways,I don't see
your hooker friend...

04:03.700 --> 04:04.330
Yeah.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.140
- I know,right?
- Hanging around anymore.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.410
Could've told you she
wouldn't be here on account of

04:08.430 --> 04:09.930
she said she wasn't leaving,

04:09.950 --> 04:11.690
of course,being the
lying bitch that she is.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.020
Yeah.Well,good riddance,right...

04:14.050 --> 04:15.750
Yeah. Tell me about it.

04:15.770 --> 04:19.230
Because,you know,it's just
a better thing for you.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.360
What do you mean by that?

04:20.390 --> 04:21.820
Let's face the facts,ok?

04:21.839 --> 04:26.200
Inside the bitter,old,crusty
outer shell of you,

04:26.230 --> 04:28.840
inside is a soft,creamy,little
chocolate ice cream center...

04:28.860 --> 04:29.860
Here's the goo speech.

04:29.890 --> 04:32.160
And I know and you know if
she starts leaning on you,

04:32.190 --> 04:34.030
you're gonna fold like a card table,ok,

04:34.060 --> 04:36.090
- and I want to remind you of one thing.
- It's not gonna happen,tom.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.640
- You live in a one-bedroom apartment. -
Those days are gone and buried,my friend,

04:38.660 --> 04:43.710
dead and buried,so why don't you put
your finger down and go inside,ok?

04:43.730 --> 04:45.020
- Ok.Finger is down.
- Yes.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.180
- Go inside.
- Going inside.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.950
- yeah?
- Hi.It's me.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.070
What are you doing?

06:04.090 --> 06:06.220
I'm flying a kite out of my
ass. What do you think I'm doing?

06:07.160 --> 06:08.600
Ach,don't say that.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.700
Now every time I look at your ass,I'm gonna
think about ben franklin coming out of it.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.700
Yeah,yeah,yeah. What's up?I got to go.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.850
I'm sorry. My house,6:30,sex.

06:16.870 --> 06:18.060
We had sex yesterday.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.580
- So?We don't have,like,a set schedule for sex.
- Oh,really?

06:20.600 --> 06:22.440
We have sex when we
feel like having sex.

06:22.460 --> 06:25.950
- Right,right,right,when you feel like it,right?
- Looks like it,buddy.

06:25.970 --> 06:29.630
Now,be here at 6:30

06:29.650 --> 06:30.550
because i got the cable guy coming
at 6:00 to do the satellite dish

06:30.570 --> 06:32.340
and then I got my book thing at 7:00,

06:32.370 --> 06:34.270
which means I got to leave here at 6:45,

06:34.300 --> 06:37.470
and make sure that you eat something
before you come or after you leave

06:37.500 --> 06:38.670
because I ain't cooking for you.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.270
All right,so I'm not even
getting a sandwich out of it,

06:40.300 --> 06:43.830
and I got,what,like 15
minutes to do the deed?

06:43.860 --> 06:46.020
For you,that's more than enough time.

06:46.050 --> 06:47.920
Ha!That's funny. I got to go.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.230
Got another call.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.810
- Hello?
- I need to talk to you.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.190
Hey,coll,what's up?

06:54.210 --> 06:55.710
Where are you?

06:55.740 --> 06:58.700
What's the deal?You can't
come into the firehouse now?

06:58.730 --> 07:01.130
He's there.If I saw him
again,I can't say what I'd do.

07:01.150 --> 07:04.730
I'd probably cut off his penis
and shove it down his throat.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.770
You know,it just seems like it was
just yesterday your mother and I were

07:07.800 --> 07:10.070
at the first communion taking pictures
of you in your little white dress,

07:10.100 --> 07:14.010
and we're already talking about
stuffing penises down people's throats.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.810
Where does the time go?

07:16.610 --> 07:18.580
Has he said anything about me?

07:18.610 --> 07:21.290
Ok.You know what? You got
to just let go of that stuff.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.860
He called me a whore.

07:22.890 --> 07:26.610
He--he called you a
whore?Wh-why did he--

07:26.610 --> 07:27.900
where does he get off
calling you a whore?

07:27.930 --> 07:30.090
You know what? Nobody
calls my daughter a whore.

07:30.110 --> 07:31.590
I'm gonna take care of this right now.

07:31.610 --> 07:33.540
- Daddy,don'T.
- Why?

07:33.560 --> 07:34.920
I'm just kidding. Go ahead.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.850
Shawn,could you shut up,please?

07:46.170 --> 07:47.740
- Shawn!
- What?What?

07:47.770 --> 07:48.760
Chill out with the singing,man.

07:48.780 --> 07:50.500
I'm trying to shave.
You're making my ears bleed.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.120
I keep thinking I'm cutting myself.

07:55.390 --> 07:56.780
you know what? You're just jealous.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.110
Yeah.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.800
Oh,shit!

08:07.820 --> 08:10.860
Hey,hey,hey,hey!
Tommy,what are you doing?

08:10.890 --> 08:12.220
Are you crazy?

08:12.240 --> 08:14.310
You don't turn a goddamn
hose on a black man.

08:14.330 --> 08:15.120
- Yeah?
- Yeah,yeah.

08:15.150 --> 08:16.780
Did you see the footage from birmingham?

08:16.810 --> 08:18.560
See the footage? I was there,ok?

08:18.590 --> 08:19.610
Ok,ok.
Oh--aah!

08:19.630 --> 08:21.040
No,no,no. Tom,stop!Stop!

08:21.060 --> 08:24.680
- Now...
- What are you doing?

08:24.700 --> 08:29.300
Did you call my daughter a whore?

08:29.320 --> 08:31.370
No.I didn't call her a whore.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.760
- So,my daughter is a liar.
- No,no.

08:33.789 --> 08:38.169
I said she did some whorish things.

08:38.190 --> 08:40.159
Oh,oh,oh. Of course.Thanks.

08:40.159 --> 08:41.789
No! Stop!Stop,ok?

08:41.809 --> 08:43.039
Ok,ok,ok.

08:43.059 --> 08:45.880
Listen.Now come on. You know I love her.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.280
Y-- Yeah.
I do.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.870
It's just that she
did all this stuff,man.

08:49.900 --> 08:50.740
Like what stuff?

08:50.760 --> 08:54.070
Like this thing with her fingernails
where she would drag them across...

08:54.090 --> 08:55.650
my parts.

08:55.670 --> 08:56.860
What are you,new?

08:56.890 --> 08:59.710
Nice girls,all kinds of nice
girls,use their fingernails.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.910
It's regular action.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.090
- But the biting,tommy,the biting.
- So?

09:03.120 --> 09:05.710
She said she learned
it from her mother,so--

09:05.740 --> 09:07.120
So now you're calling my wife a whore.

09:07.140 --> 09:08.540
No,no,no,no,tommy!

09:08.560 --> 09:09.500
I would never,tommy.

09:09.530 --> 09:12.610
God,tommy,no.I'm not
calling your wife a whore.

09:12.640 --> 09:13.790
Are you kidding me? No.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.370
It's just that she said she learned
different things from different people,ok,

09:17.390 --> 09:20.430
like her mother,the musician,and
this tattoo artist...

09:20.460 --> 09:21.690
Scumbag. Yeah?

09:21.710 --> 09:24.760
Like the ass stuff.

09:24.780 --> 09:27.110
I'm sorry. Wh-what?

09:27.130 --> 09:28.110
The ass stuff. Come on.

09:28.140 --> 09:32.310
Don't make me go through some long,drawn
out explanation about the ass stuff.

09:33.290 --> 09:35.910
She did
stuff to--

09:35.950 --> 09:38.180
My ass,

09:38.210 --> 09:39.690
peanut butter and all.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.420
- What?
- Chunky.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.240
Holy shit.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.470
It's a private conversation.

09:46.490 --> 09:48.600
I don't let anybody touch my ass.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.080
Anymore.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.790
Freaking unbelievable.

09:52.810 --> 09:54.650
What is wrong with tommy?

09:54.670 --> 09:56.910
- I don't know,man.
- Are you all right?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.940
No,man. I'm not ok.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.470
I think you got a little
peanut butter on your ass.

10:01.490 --> 10:03.570
Hey--aw,shit,franco.
Stop it,franco.

10:03.610 --> 10:05.020
You're all wrong for that shit.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.900
Jesus christ.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.590
- You're kidding.
- No.I wish.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.460
But you're a young guy.

10:16.470 --> 10:18.680
- Is there any history of it?
- No,no.

10:18.710 --> 10:20.600
I mean,I just found out my
mother had breast cancer,but

10:20.620 --> 10:22.500
I don't think that had
anything to do with it.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.040
So,no idea?

10:24.060 --> 10:25.610
No.I'm sure it's ground zero-related.

10:25.630 --> 10:27.350
That's what my doctors think.

10:27.370 --> 10:30.180
- Oh,you poor son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

10:31.620 --> 10:34.400
I can't even eat my doughnut now.

10:34.410 --> 10:36.660
I'm actually on the way
to the hospital.they--

10:36.690 --> 10:39.820
took a chest x-ray yesterday,checked
my heart and everything,and

10:39.850 --> 10:42.700
it looks good,so I may go
under the knife tonight.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.630
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

10:44.650 --> 10:46.870
- Oh,sean,I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.No.It's good.

10:46.890 --> 10:49.260
I'm trying to be positive,you
know,be upbeat about it.

10:49.270 --> 10:52.090
I mean,you can function fully on one
kidney--that's what the doctors say--

10:52.110 --> 10:54.360
so it's really not that much
to worry about,i don't think.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.280
Yeah.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.420
- It's cancer.
- Yeah.It's--

10:58.440 --> 11:00.050
Cancer.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.580
I've had so many relatives,you know,

11:02.610 --> 11:05.610
the doctor said they'd be
fine,you know,after surgery,

11:05.640 --> 11:09.160
chemo,gone,

11:09.190 --> 11:11.040
overnight some of them.

11:11.060 --> 11:12.920
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.690
That's too bad.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.950
Well,I hadn't really,

11:17.970 --> 11:19.740
had a chance to talk to
the guys yet,so I was--

11:19.770 --> 11:21.800
I didn't want them to worry,you know?

11:22.460 --> 11:25.160
Yeah,and you don't want them to think
that,you know,you can't do the job...

11:25.190 --> 11:26.290
Yeah.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.560
You know,in the event that you survive.

11:27.590 --> 11:30.130
Yeah.It's--

11:31.800 --> 11:34.630
anyway,looks like I'm gonna be about

11:34.660 --> 11:36.120
two weeks in the hospital and then

11:36.150 --> 11:39.960
probably another two weeks at
home in recovery and whatnot,so

11:39.980 --> 11:42.180
if it's cool with you,I was kind
of hoping you could cover for me,

11:42.200 --> 11:44.000
in terms of the department,you
know,make something up.

11:44.020 --> 11:45.200
You don't worry about a thing,all right?

11:45.220 --> 11:46.360
You broke your hand.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.800
I'll get you a month,6
weeks,whatever you need.

11:48.820 --> 11:51.110
Thank you.It's really important that they
don't know what's actually going on here.

11:51.130 --> 11:53.380
I mean,I wouldn't even be able to
get a desk job if they found out.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.700
I'd be out of the department
for sure,all right?

11:54.720 --> 11:55.640
- Look at me.
- Ok.

11:55.670 --> 11:56.790
You worry about nothing,all right?

11:56.810 --> 11:58.860
I'm gonna call the brass as
soon as we get back to the house.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.130
- Put this out of your mind.
- Great.Thanks.

12:10.370 --> 12:12.130
Nice day.

12:14.420 --> 12:16.260
It's a little cool.

12:17.260 --> 12:19.420
Not so cool indoors.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.880
Firehouse nice and warm.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.400
You hungry?

12:23.420 --> 12:24.890
- Yeah.
- Not me.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.080
You know why?Because I'm
eating this big sandwich.

12:27.110 --> 12:28.510
It's got everything in here.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.680
- I know what you're doing.
- What am I doing?

12:30.700 --> 12:33.140
I'm eating.I'm
drinking.I'm enjoying this

12:33.160 --> 12:35.190
beautiful unseasonably cool weather with

12:35.220 --> 12:38.760
temperatures that are supposed to
drop to the low to mid 50s tonight.

12:38.790 --> 12:40.910
Look. I know you,ken.

12:40.930 --> 12:43.370
You won't turn me
away,not when I need you.

12:43.390 --> 12:44.920
You're a good person.

12:44.950 --> 12:48.970
No.No.I was a good person

12:49.000 --> 12:50.930
until certain bad people,

12:50.960 --> 12:52.900
present company definitely included,

12:52.920 --> 12:56.240
convinced me that good people are dupes.

12:56.260 --> 12:58.970
Good people are chickens
waiting to be plucked.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.210
They're low to the ground,

13:00.230 --> 13:03.210
that much easier to be stepped
on and stolen from and broken,

13:03.230 --> 13:05.260
so,no,you don't know me.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.110
You don't know me.

13:07.140 --> 13:10.130
I'm changed,ken.I keep my word,

13:10.150 --> 13:12.920
and when I say I'm
not leaving,I mean it,

13:12.940 --> 13:16.640
and no matter what
you say or how you act,

13:16.670 --> 13:19.190
you still care about me.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.560
All right. Enough of
this goddamn bullshit.

13:24.140 --> 13:27.230
I've got a goddamn firehouse full
of men over there,my chief included,

13:27.260 --> 13:29.990
who keep on asking me what the hell is
up with that crazy bitch across the street

13:30.020 --> 13:32.800
who wants to talk to me,and
i don't have a goddamn answer,

13:32.820 --> 13:35.390
so you want to talk to
me,leave me a goddamn number

13:35.410 --> 13:38.630
but just don't get me kicked off
the job on top of everything else.

13:50.980 --> 13:52.770
Please use it.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.250
It's important.

13:54.270 --> 13:56.830
Take a goddamn walk.

13:56.860 --> 13:59.040
Please?

14:08.040 --> 14:09.170
Never.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.910
I mean,the fingernail rake,the
tongue flick,the biting--

14:11.930 --> 14:13.360
check,check,check.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.840
I never mentioned
anything about the ass.

14:15.860 --> 14:17.440
You?

14:17.460 --> 14:19.400
No.I'd
never say--

14:19.420 --> 14:22.570
only thing I know about asses
is,you know,I like yours.

14:22.590 --> 14:24.300
That's nice.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.060
Honey,I'm telling you,this is not funny.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.160
This kid was traumatized.
You should've seen him.

14:28.180 --> 14:31.260
- What,by colleen?
- Well,by coll--

14:31.280 --> 14:34.440
the fire hose from the shower probably had a
little bit to do with it,yeah,but mostly by--

14:34.460 --> 14:36.670
What,you turned a hose on a black man?

14:36.690 --> 14:38.150
Honey,it's--
pfft,a black man.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.850
He's not,like,a black
man from the sixties.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.010
This kid is 26 years old.

14:41.030 --> 14:43.770
I mean,as far as he's concerned,the only
thing he knows about civil rights-- I mean,

14:43.800 --> 14:49.040
he probably actually thinks the guy's real
name is martin luther king-day,you know?

14:54.080 --> 14:56.070
What are
you--what?

14:56.090 --> 14:58.770
Ah,you look sexy in those bunker pants.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.760
- I know,honey.
- Let's get you out of them.

15:00.780 --> 15:03.180
We're not gonna
have sex in the--

15:03.210 --> 15:07.010
seriously,what do you want,your purse?

15:07.030 --> 15:08.690
What are you
reaching--

15:08.710 --> 15:13.810
well,a hand job is ok. I guess
it's not like we live here.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.310
Oh,yeah. Ok.

15:17.030 --> 15:18.810
Where you going?

15:18.830 --> 15:21.020
Honey,where you going?

15:21.040 --> 15:22.300
Honey?

15:25.660 --> 15:27.460
What--

15:27.480 --> 15:29.720
Ok. Yeah.

15:31.380 --> 15:32.540
Do you hear something?

15:32.560 --> 15:34.190
Nope.

15:34.190 --> 15:37.680
Oh,baby,that's
just--

15:37.710 --> 15:40.290
- Oh,god,I needed this.
- I guess so.

15:40.310 --> 15:41.300
Yeah.

15:41.330 --> 15:43.180
Oh,ho ho ho!

15:44.640 --> 15:46.840
Oh,yeah.Oh--

15:46.870 --> 15:48.730
Think I definitely--
I think--

15:55.060 --> 15:58.370
I am so sorry to interrupt. Just
a little department business.

15:58.390 --> 15:59.910
Hi,janet.

15:59.930 --> 16:01.890
Wait here,honey.

16:01.900 --> 16:06.810
Tom,would you be available to join us
for one of our little fire thingies?

16:06.830 --> 16:08.350
We need all the help we can get.

16:08.380 --> 16:11.240
- Yeah.
- Excellent.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.820
Bye,jan.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.640
I'll call you later,honey.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.700
Look.She came by because she
wanted to talk about our daughter.

16:41.310 --> 16:43.960
I mean,you know,franco,back me up.

16:43.990 --> 16:46.710
She comes to talk to me.
It wasn't like I planned--

16:46.740 --> 16:49.540
No,no.

16:51.190 --> 16:52.810
You know what we got into?We
started talking about colleen,

16:52.840 --> 16:55.490
- and next thing I know,she's
pawing-- - Please,please.

16:55.500 --> 16:59.780
I'm basking in this
moment,this glorious moment.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.250
For all I know,for the next 10 years,

17:02.270 --> 17:05.380
I've got you by the balls.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.970
Mint?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.700
No,thank you.

17:11.410 --> 17:13.430
Franco?

17:13.450 --> 17:16.089
I don't mind if I do.

17:17.450 --> 17:19.550
Life is good.

17:24.069 --> 17:26.780
All right,man. Catch you later.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.700
Somebody is tearing
that bag to shit,huh?

17:28.730 --> 17:30.740
Wouldn't want to be in
the ring with that monster.

17:42.570 --> 17:44.940
Madre mia.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.160
What do you want the dvd for?

17:47.180 --> 17:50.030
The kids miss their grandpa,you
know,especially katy.

17:50.050 --> 17:52.060
She was asking about it.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.000
You know what?I'll just
swing by and pick it up.

17:55.020 --> 17:56.400
It's no big thing.I
mean,you know--

17:56.420 --> 17:57.540
Sure,you can pick it up.

17:57.550 --> 17:59.730
I'll be at the meeting
tonight on spring,10:00.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.420
I don't have time to
come to the meeting.

18:01.430 --> 18:04.510
Well,no meeting,no dvd.

18:04.530 --> 18:06.370
Mick,come on.

18:06.390 --> 18:08.360
Hey,them's the rules,cuz.

18:08.370 --> 18:09.930
Take it or leave it.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.030
Taking it,always taking it.

18:14.350 --> 18:15.900
Asshole.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.460
- Hello?
- Hi.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.520
Hey,oh,wow.

18:21.210 --> 18:22.970
Hey,I like the place.

18:22.990 --> 18:24.440
I know,right? I'll be right out.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.030
Yeah.I know you're
pressed for time,so--

18:27.050 --> 18:28.940
this is nice.I like
it. It's more intimate.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.490
Where's
the--oh.

18:31.510 --> 18:34.610
Anyways,I know this neighborhood.
It's a great neighborhood.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.660
Come on.Let's get rolling.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.490
I tell you something right now. You
get your little brown ass out here.

18:39.510 --> 18:44.760
I am gonna take it to town,my
dear,little,sweet,hot minx.

18:44.780 --> 18:48.960
Mm,I tell you
something.I am so horny--

18:48.990 --> 18:51.660
Hi.

18:51.690 --> 18:53.330
I'm don.

18:53.350 --> 18:55.750
I'm putting the satellite dish in.

19:00.690 --> 19:03.650
I had a cat once named minx...

19:03.660 --> 19:05.820
- Oh,yeah?
- When I was a kid.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.820
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.300
Oh,so you guys have met.

19:10.330 --> 19:11.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:11.920 --> 19:15.110
I got to check the roof
for the exterior cables.

19:15.140 --> 19:16.730
Nice meeting you.

19:16.750 --> 19:20.640
How long,ballpark,you
think that's gonna take you?

19:20.670 --> 19:22.700
- The roof?
- Yeah.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.910
Maybe 20 minutes.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.380
I'll knock before I come back in.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.980
All right. Come
on.Let's get--

19:29.000 --> 19:31.330
No.We are not doing it with
that pervy in the house.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.340
He said we had 20 minutes.

19:32.370 --> 19:33.900
No.Anyway,I have my book club.

19:33.940 --> 19:34.910
What book club?

19:34.930 --> 19:36.250
My book club,and I'm not missing it,

19:36.280 --> 19:37.430
because we're doing "eat,pray,love,"

19:37.450 --> 19:39.330
which is my favorite book of all time

19:39.350 --> 19:42.330
because this woman,like,goes
on a journey after she's been--

19:42.360 --> 19:44.840
what?"Eat,pray,love."

19:44.870 --> 19:47.830
Wasn't written by an irish chick.
Otherwise,it'd be called "drink,puke,drink."

19:47.840 --> 19:49.810
- That's not funny.
- It's funny.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.050
- No,it's not.
- It's pretty funny.

19:51.080 --> 19:51.930
It's a little bit funny.

19:51.950 --> 19:53.590
Come on.Come on. We got time.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.560
No,no. What about the pervy?

19:54.600 --> 19:55.750
No,no. Wait.Listen.

19:55.770 --> 19:57.040
I want to talk to you about something.

19:57.060 --> 19:58.240
- What.
- No.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.140
I heard about what happened
with mike and what you did.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.110
- Splinter lips.
- What is that?What?

20:02.130 --> 20:05.050
It happens to everybody.
Room fills up with smoke.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.810
Guy gets panicky because
his tank is empty,

20:06.830 --> 20:08.540
and I was feeding him off my tank,and

20:08.560 --> 20:11.490
in between gulps of air,he
was,you know,full of fear,

20:11.510 --> 20:15.690
so I had to press his face down below
the smoke level,and splinter lips.Come on.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.160
Promise me-- you
got to promise me

20:18.190 --> 20:21.010
that damien is gonna get into your house
and that you're gonna keep watch over him.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.120
Yeah. Listen.

20:22.150 --> 20:25.100
When he graduates,ok,

20:25.130 --> 20:27.250
he's stuck by my side.He's
stuck to me like glue.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.620
I'm gonna teach him
every trick in the book.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.950
He's gonna be fine,but,you
know,he's got to do his part now.

20:31.970 --> 20:34.320
He's got to graduate
first,and that I can't fix.

20:34.350 --> 20:36.110
- Come on.
- What about pervy?

20:36.140 --> 20:37.280
Come on.Come on. We had a pact.

20:37.310 --> 20:38.850
Oh,all right.

20:41.130 --> 20:42.560
Pulling it down.

20:45.760 --> 20:46.910
Hi.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.320
Sorry.

20:48.340 --> 20:51.500
Just need to grab a splitter.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.580
Ok.

20:55.130 --> 20:58.480
Is it possible that it would be
easier if you just took the whole

20:58.510 --> 21:02.860
tool bag thing up there
into the area where you're--

21:02.870 --> 21:05.410
Yeah.That's a good idea,in theory,

21:05.440 --> 21:09.960
but most of my actual work is
actually done right here,and--

21:09.990 --> 21:12.180
you don't want to hear
this right now,do you?

21:12.210 --> 21:14.290
Ok.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.260
Ok. He's gone.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.370
Oh,you want to play around?

21:22.390 --> 21:23.530
What?

21:23.540 --> 21:25.480
- You stink.
- No,I don'T.

21:25.510 --> 21:29.110
I took a shower before I left
the firehouse.What are you--

21:29.140 --> 21:32.380
Opium. You smell like opium.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.930
Ok. That is insane.

21:33.950 --> 21:35.440
You've known me how long?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.480
Weed,hash.I wouldn't know
where to even get any--

21:37.510 --> 21:40.180
Janet,you donkey.Janet.

21:40.210 --> 21:43.940
I got janet stank all over me because
you got janet stank all over you,

21:43.960 --> 21:45.960
and you want to know why I
know? Because that's her perfume.

21:45.990 --> 21:49.580
That's her "scent." She's been wearing
it since the eighties,since high school...

21:49.600 --> 21:50.100
She stopped
by the fire--

21:50.130 --> 21:51.830
Ok,which shows how out of
touch she is with the real world

21:51.860 --> 21:55.020
because even the homos who made
that scent don't wear it anymore...

21:55.050 --> 21:57.020
But,see,that's besides the point

21:57.050 --> 21:58.560
because,see,the real point

21:58.590 --> 22:02.310
is that I asked you to do
one single,solitary thing,

22:02.330 --> 22:05.090
and that was to not
have sex with your wife

22:05.120 --> 22:07.720
on the same day that
you're having sex with me,

22:07.740 --> 22:09.150
and you can't even manage that.

22:09.170 --> 22:10.350
I didn't have sex.

22:12.340 --> 22:13.840
Oh,god.

22:13.860 --> 22:14.680
Sorry.

22:14.700 --> 22:20.200
I-- Just take the stupid
thing and go up on the--

22:20.220 --> 22:21.910
No.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.500
You stay. You go.

22:24.520 --> 22:27.490
You know what?I got another job down
the block that I could do right now.

22:27.510 --> 22:28.480
No,no. No.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.620
I know you guys.

22:29.650 --> 22:32.860
You're not leaving my sight
until you hook up my cable.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.420
Beat it.

22:34.450 --> 22:37.050
But
I--

22:37.080 --> 22:41.470
could you give us a little
privacy for just,like,a second?

22:47.880 --> 22:49.890
She ambushed me.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.950
What? Anybody who ambushes you.

22:55.390 --> 22:56.640
There-- there was
no penetration.

22:56.660 --> 22:58.610
- What?What did you say?
- There was no penetration.

22:59.310 --> 23:01.020
- I think I'm gonna puke.
- What?I'm just explaining.

23:01.050 --> 23:01.810
I'm gonna puke.

23:01.830 --> 23:03.480
You know,it's funny.

23:03.510 --> 23:06.770
I had the same kind of thing
happen with my ex for a while,

23:06.790 --> 23:08.670
and you know you're not
supposed to have sex,

23:08.690 --> 23:13.290
but one thing happens after the next,and
then I'm gonna go hook up the dish.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.350
Yeah. Ok.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.210
Ok.
I--

23:23.340 --> 23:24.960
You leave my grapes.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.010
I thought you were gonna fix the thing.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.230
Sorry.

23:34.370 --> 23:36.200
The ecg is great.

23:36.220 --> 23:38.010
Your heart is in really good shape,

23:38.030 --> 23:40.650
and all the blood tests
came back very good,

23:40.680 --> 23:43.540
so I think we're on for later today.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.060
Are you doing a radical nephrectomy?

23:46.080 --> 23:47.730
That's right.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.540
Are you taking the
adrenal gland,as well?

23:49.560 --> 23:50.950
Yeah.

23:50.970 --> 23:51.580
Any lymph nodes?

23:51.600 --> 23:53.260
Don't talk to him about
my lymph nodes. I'm sorry.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.570
He's not a doctor. He's
just my brother.Jesus.

23:54.590 --> 23:56.010
- "Just"?
- Yeah,just.

23:56.030 --> 23:58.440
Oh,fine. I won't say another word.

23:58.470 --> 23:59.180
Fine.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.880
I was just going over the
game plan with your surgeon

24:00.900 --> 24:02.680
in case he forgot what you were in for

24:02.700 --> 24:06.280
and decided to accidentally hack off one
of you balls,which happens,by the way.

24:06.310 --> 24:08.270
- It does.
- What?

24:08.290 --> 24:10.350
Oh,I'm kidding.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.140
Oh,yeah.That's--

24:13.150 --> 24:15.850
um,is there anything I should
be doing to,you know,prepare?

24:15.870 --> 24:17.800
Just relax. Take it easy.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.660
We're gonna get an I.V.Started,

24:19.690 --> 24:21.310
and then we're gonna
shave you for surgery.

24:21.330 --> 24:24.020
- Oh,can I do that?
- Shut up,terrence.Jesus.

24:24.040 --> 24:26.200
I want to put a design on
his back,maybe my initials.

24:26.220 --> 24:28.380
Yeah.You can put,like,an
A.H.For "asshole.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.870
" Hey,cancer or not,I'll take you down.

24:29.890 --> 24:31.150
Oh,come on.Bring it,you douche.Come on.

24:31.170 --> 24:34.860
Jesus christ,not in
the goddamn hospital.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.130
- Sean,leave your brother alone.
- He started it.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.620
Sean,sean,you got to take it easy.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.600
You can't exert yourself
before major surgery like this.

24:42.630 --> 24:44.810
Yeah.What if something
happened,you didn't wake up?

24:44.840 --> 24:47.870
Is this how you want it to end with
your brother,with fighting and anger?

24:47.890 --> 24:49.680
What if I don't wake up?Ma!

24:49.700 --> 24:51.700
- It happens.
- It does.

24:51.720 --> 24:52.880
What?

24:52.900 --> 24:54.410
I'm kidding again.

24:54.430 --> 24:55.760
Oh,my god.

24:55.780 --> 24:57.870
Shake your brother's hand.
We'll go,let you get some rest.

24:57.900 --> 24:58.760
No.I'm not shaking his hand,ma.

24:58.780 --> 25:00.550
Shake his hand.

25:00.570 --> 25:02.350
Ohh...

25:06.480 --> 25:07.560
I'm sorry,terrence.

25:07.580 --> 25:09.660
Oh!You're such an asshole.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.700
- Come on,squirt.
- Knock it off.

25:11.730 --> 25:13.550
Have a brother,doctor?

25:13.570 --> 25:15.740
- No.
- Then you understand.

25:15.760 --> 25:19.860
So,this isn't some type of
over-the-top workout regimen thing?

25:19.880 --> 25:21.610
You actually box people?

25:21.630 --> 25:24.730
Yeah.I came in second in
the golden gloves last year.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.800
Really? All chicks?

25:26.820 --> 25:28.960
Yeah.I mean,I wouldn't
mind taking on a guy.

25:28.980 --> 25:31.460
It's just,you know,the
whole macho thing.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.510
It's good for a joke
or busting my balls,

25:33.530 --> 25:36.410
but talk about actually getting in
the ring,and they suddenly vamoose.

25:36.430 --> 25:38.410
Yeah?You know,I wouldn't mind
going a couple rounds with you.

25:38.410 --> 25:40.220
- Oh,yeah?
- Yeah.

25:40.250 --> 25:42.240
Wouldn't mind boxing,either.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.320
Sorry.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.220
You know,I wouldn't
fight you,anyway,dude.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.430
You're too pretty.

25:54.450 --> 25:56.340
I'd mess you up for the
rest of the girls.Please.

25:56.360 --> 26:00.450
Oh,no,no,no,no,no.You and me get
together,baby,there wouldn't be any other girls,ok?

26:00.490 --> 26:02.920
Sorry. Sorry.

26:02.940 --> 26:05.780
Is that a reflex? You
only talk in pickup lines?

26:05.810 --> 26:07.540
It's more of an affliction,actually.

26:07.570 --> 26:10.910
Well,maybe I ought to buy
you a drink,see how that goes.

26:11.750 --> 26:13.900
Yeah.Yeah. That sounds good.

26:13.930 --> 26:15.890
Ok. Well,let me just shower,ok?

26:15.910 --> 26:17.400
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

26:17.430 --> 26:19.580
- Don't go anywhere.
- No,no.I'll be waiting right here.

26:19.610 --> 26:20.860
All right.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.420
Hey,what's up?

26:29.440 --> 26:30.660
Hey,how you doing?

26:30.680 --> 26:32.240
Good. Got the dvd?

26:32.270 --> 26:34.940
- Oh,yeah.I got it...
- Can I grab it?

26:34.960 --> 26:37.460
Home movies,gavin
family,all the glory...

26:37.490 --> 26:38.720
- Yeah.
- Plus bootsy.

26:38.740 --> 26:40.220
Plus bootsy. Come on.I got it.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.130
Hey,what do you mean?

26:41.140 --> 26:42.610
Stick around for the
meeting,I'll give you that.

26:42.630 --> 26:44.960
Still wearing the sunglasses,huh?

26:44.990 --> 26:46.490
- Sorry?
- You don't remember?

26:46.510 --> 26:48.040
He doesn't remember.

26:48.060 --> 26:50.420
Couple years ago,meeting uptown,

26:50.440 --> 26:52.340
I politely ask you to
take the sunglasses off

26:52.360 --> 26:53.970
while you're in the
meeting,respect the meeting...

26:53.990 --> 26:56.670
And you come over and shove
me over a goddamn cookie table?

26:56.690 --> 26:58.060
You know,I do remember that.

26:58.080 --> 26:58.570
It's not funny.

26:58.590 --> 27:00.840
It's not funny I always meant to
apologize.I know it wasn't funny.

27:00.860 --> 27:02.540
What name you going
by tonight,by the way--

27:02.560 --> 27:04.780
bobby,ricky,john,ed?

27:04.790 --> 27:05.990
Ok,ok. You want to bust my balls?

27:06.020 --> 27:07.240
You know what? Never mind.

27:07.270 --> 27:08.080
I don't give a shit.

27:08.110 --> 27:08.940
Then why did you bring it up?

27:08.960 --> 27:11.350
I'm trying to apologize
to you for your,you know--

27:11.380 --> 27:13.350
Have a nice meeting,asshole.

27:13.370 --> 27:15.020
Ok.Some people can't let things go.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.650
I don't want that.

27:17.790 --> 27:20.240
- Believe this guy?
- Pathetic.Psycho.

27:20.270 --> 27:21.410
Yeah.Come on.I got to go.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.580
No,no,no. What are you talking?

27:22.600 --> 27:23.450
Where are you going?

27:23.480 --> 27:25.470
- You're in such a rush.
- I am in a rush.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.130
- Where are you going,home?
- I'm going home eventually.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.260
You're going home eventually?

27:28.290 --> 27:29.530
- Yeah.
- You know what I think?

27:29.560 --> 27:32.000
I think when you get home,i think
you're gonna pop this thing right in...

27:32.020 --> 27:33.780
- I might.I might.
- Right in the old dvd player.

27:33.800 --> 27:37.620
You're gonna sit back,pour yourself
a nice,big tumbler of whiskey,

27:37.640 --> 27:43.310
and then sit down and have yourself
a nice,beautiful,long,cleansing cry.

27:46.450 --> 27:48.520
That's the funny thing about drunks,tom.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.490
They think alcohol
is the key--

27:50.520 --> 27:52.370
you know,it makes them free,

27:52.400 --> 27:55.760
makes them feel,opens them
up,lets everything go--

27:55.780 --> 27:57.470
but it ain't the key.

27:57.490 --> 27:59.400
It's the lock.

28:00.650 --> 28:02.930
Who told you?

28:02.950 --> 28:06.500
You did just now.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.010
Look.You want to know the truth?Yeah.

28:09.030 --> 28:11.440
- I'm drinking again.You know why?
- The truth.

28:11.470 --> 28:13.870
Just listen to me. I can control it.

28:13.900 --> 28:14.940
You want a little headline?

28:14.960 --> 28:17.780
I've been drinking for a little while
now,and I haven't gotten drunk yet.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.080
Yeah.Have a couple of drinks
at a time,and I enjoy myself.

28:20.100 --> 28:20.640
Is that right?

28:20.670 --> 28:21.970
I relax. I unwind,ok?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.430
So,I made my choice. You make yours.

28:23.450 --> 28:24.850
- Now give me the dvd.
- No.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.310
No meeting,no dvd. I'm sorry,brother.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.500
- Give me the dvd.
- Don't you touch that.

28:29.530 --> 28:31.260
Don'T.Want to get started with that?

28:31.280 --> 28:32.610
Yeah.I do. You're not
getting this thing.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.580
Everybody,my speaker for the
meeting didn't show up tonight.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.580
Would anybody like to come up and speak?

28:38.570 --> 28:40.380
Yeah.We got a speaker right here.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.270
Great.Gentleman in the black shirt.

28:42.290 --> 28:44.960
Now you tell them what you just told me.

28:44.980 --> 28:45.780
I'm not doing it.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.180
You don't tell them,I'm
not giving it to you.

28:50.180 --> 28:51.940
Go ahead. There he is.

29:05.330 --> 29:07.700
All right.Come on up.Uh,some
of you probably know me as al...

29:07.730 --> 29:10.080
Hi,al.

29:10.910 --> 29:14.520
And some of you probably
know me as bobby.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.460
Hi,bobby.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.880
Don't forget about frank.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.260
My real name is tommy...

29:21.280 --> 29:23.480
Hi,tommy.

29:23.500 --> 29:30.110
And I am not an alcoholic,ok?

29:30.140 --> 29:35.200
I actually received my one-year
chip about a month ago,and...

29:40.290 --> 29:41.640
About a week after that,

29:41.670 --> 29:44.560
I left it in the bottom of a shot glass

29:44.580 --> 29:47.760
in a bar across the
street from ground zero.

29:47.780 --> 29:51.760
I'm a fireman,and I was there that day.

29:51.780 --> 29:53.450
I've seen some shit in my job,

29:53.470 --> 29:58.370
but that day,I saw some shit that

29:58.400 --> 30:00.740
I never expected to see,

30:00.760 --> 30:04.740
so I drank more than I usually did.

30:04.770 --> 30:09.630
I drank maybe a little too
much,and my marriage went south,and,

30:09.660 --> 30:14.930
anyways,my cousin told
me about this.I came.

30:14.950 --> 30:17.760
I started going to these meetings,and--I
got to be honest with you--

30:17.770 --> 30:22.380
I expected it to help me.

30:22.390 --> 30:26.000
I had heard about
the higher power,and--

30:26.020 --> 30:31.500
I don't know--i guess I expected
the sky to open up a little bit and

30:31.520 --> 30:34.650
to get some revelations,

30:34.670 --> 30:38.040
and it didn't come right
away,and I stuck with it,and,

30:38.070 --> 30:42.430
you know,my life was very
difficult.I--like I said,

30:42.450 --> 30:45.220
trying to get around
all the shit in my head--

30:45.250 --> 30:50.380
kept coming here
waiting for an epiphany,

30:50.400 --> 30:53.760
I guess,and that didn't come,either.

30:53.780 --> 31:02.070
Instead,what I got was a
bunch of whining assholes.

31:02.090 --> 31:06.580
That's what I got.I got my shitty
life plus yours,for instance.

31:06.610 --> 31:08.480
I know your story. I've
seen you at enough meetings.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.000
You're the wall street guy,right?

31:10.020 --> 31:12.120
You started out as you
wanted to be a painter,

31:12.150 --> 31:13.950
and your father pushed you
into the family business.

31:13.970 --> 31:15.880
You're chasing money around,and
that's why you drank and,

31:15.900 --> 31:20.190
"oh,i wanted to be a
painter.Oh,blah,blah,blah," right,and

31:20.210 --> 31:23.230
I know you because you're the
chick that you drank because

31:23.250 --> 31:24.700
you couldn't meet a
guy that would commit.

31:24.710 --> 31:27.450
Then finally,when you were drinking,you
met some guy that you committed.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.110
You got an engagement
ring,and then he left you,

31:29.140 --> 31:31.990
and so you quit drinking because you
thought maybe you were too boozed up,

31:32.010 --> 31:32.890
and now you can't meet a guy

31:32.910 --> 31:36.790
because you can't go to bars and
drink and meet a guy and whatever.

31:36.810 --> 31:38.320
I've heard you often enough,sweetheart.

31:38.340 --> 31:43.730
You're a bitch on wheels,ok?Be
honest,as honest as I can be,all right?

31:43.760 --> 31:46.130
You people want to
bitch about something?

31:46.150 --> 31:48.990
Try jumping off the back of a rig,ok,

31:49.010 --> 31:50.370
with 65 pounds of air on your back

31:50.400 --> 31:52.740
and a couple of tools in your hand
staring up at a burning building,ok,

31:52.770 --> 31:56.250
and running in when everybody
else is running out,ok?

31:57.030 --> 32:00.690
Don't give me that look. Let
me tell you something else,ok?

32:00.720 --> 32:04.010
You better pray that if your
wall street office or your

32:04.020 --> 32:07.150
luxury lonely loft that
you're always talking about,

32:07.170 --> 32:11.370
if it's full of smoke,that there's
a guy with balls as big as mine

32:11.400 --> 32:16.450
who jumps off a rig and
runs in and carries you out,

32:16.470 --> 32:20.210
and I'll tell you what.If I do,if I
happen to save your ass or your ass,

32:20.250 --> 32:22.740
you know what I'm gonna do
afterwards when I get home?

32:22.760 --> 32:28.090
I'm gonna have a
nice,big,tall,cold glass of vodka

32:28.110 --> 32:31.200
or a nice warm tumbler full of whiskey.

32:31.220 --> 32:33.520
That's what I'm gonna have.

32:37.270 --> 32:38.660
You guys got nothing for me?

32:38.690 --> 32:40.990
That's what I got for you.
That's my little message.

32:41.020 --> 32:43.810
I'm gonna spend the rest of my
time on this particular planet

32:43.830 --> 32:48.250
drinking and liking it.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.350
My suggestion to you?

32:51.440 --> 32:53.260
Try doing the same.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.530
Bottoms up,folks.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.610
Happy now?

33:07.130 --> 33:08.750
Thank you.

33:08.770 --> 33:11.190
Good night,everybody.

33:23.730 --> 33:24.780
Hello?

33:24.800 --> 33:27.070
Yeah.Hey,lou,I need someone to talk to.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.530
- Chief?
- Yeah.Look.

33:28.550 --> 33:31.710
I have some information
about one of the guys,

33:31.730 --> 33:33.100
and I can't keep it to myself.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.170
- Is it about tommy?
- What about tommy?

33:35.200 --> 33:37.070
Oh,nothing,no,I mean,unless
you heard something,

33:37.100 --> 33:41.210
in which case,I can tell you beyond a
shadow of a doubt that it ain't true.

33:41.240 --> 33:43.320
Of course. Nah.

33:43.350 --> 33:45.130
It's about garrity.

33:45.130 --> 33:47.410
- Hey,a sam adams ok?
- Yeah.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.180
Excuse me. Sam adams.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.970
- You got it.
- Thanks.

33:52.080 --> 33:54.010
So,firefighter,huh?

33:54.020 --> 33:55.070
That's pretty cool.

33:55.090 --> 33:56.530
Yeah. It's a job,you know?

33:56.550 --> 33:58.140
What do you do for a living?

33:58.160 --> 34:00.400
- Mechanic.
- No shit.

34:00.420 --> 34:03.370
My father owned a garage.
I have 4 older brothers.

34:03.390 --> 34:05.510
One is a doctor,gay.

34:05.530 --> 34:07.870
One is in sales,straight.

34:07.890 --> 34:10.360
One is a landscape designer,gay,

34:10.389 --> 34:13.020
and one is a choreographer,straight.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.500
A straight choreographer?

34:14.520 --> 34:16.060
Mm-hmm,it might be a quota thing.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.750
None of them liked cars,

34:18.780 --> 34:21.260
so my old man,he taught
me everything he knew.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.929
I run a garage cooperative in queens.

34:22.940 --> 34:25.420
I fix cars for low-income families.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.530
Hey,that's really great.

34:27.550 --> 34:29.320
Yeah,and really grimy.

34:30.960 --> 34:32.219
I got to tinkle.

34:33.179 --> 34:34.120
Don't go anywhere.

34:34.150 --> 34:35.380
No,no,no. I'm all yours.

34:35.409 --> 34:36.650
All right.

34:36.679 --> 34:38.070
Hey.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.040
So,how long before it starts working?

34:50.060 --> 34:51.580
Oh,it won't take long at all.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.810
Ok,and am I gonna feel
anything,you know,during?

34:54.840 --> 34:57.990
Somebody will be monitoring
you during the entire procedure.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.660
Ok. Great.

35:01.340 --> 35:05.230
# Free yourself from all concern #

35:05.240 --> 35:11.630
# Free yourself from care #

35:11.650 --> 35:13.310
I'm sorry.Are you singing?

35:13.330 --> 35:21.060
# Let your burdens drift
away on the evening air #

35:21.080 --> 35:23.390
Oh,this shit is good.

35:24.840 --> 35:29.720
# Give yourself to simple slumber #

35:29.740 --> 35:34.340
# all your dreaming unencumbered #

35:34.360 --> 35:38.720
# leave every burden #

35:38.740 --> 35:43.380
# sleep and rest your weakened body #

35:43.410 --> 35:48.070
# weary mind,and weary heart #

35:48.100 --> 35:53.650
# close your eyes allow
the darkness come #

35:53.670 --> 36:08.260
# time now to sleep,sleep
sleep,sleep sleep,sleep #

36:17.750 --> 36:23.570
# There is only now and then #

36:23.590 --> 36:27.020
# everything else is who knows? #

36:27.050 --> 36:31.390
# Someday when I don't want to die #

36:31.420 --> 36:34.600
# not my time to go #

36:34.620 --> 36:37.230
# too much left to try #

36:37.250 --> 36:41.720
# too much left to know oh,oh,oh,oh #

36:45.000 --> 36:46.200
What are you singing for? You sound gay.

36:46.220 --> 36:50.530
- # Never gave my heart completely #
- What a sissy.

36:50.550 --> 36:51.890
Wonder if my mother knows about this.

36:52.540 --> 36:57.770
# Never found the one who
could complete me never-- #

36:57.790 --> 36:58.910
goddamn it,terrence!

36:58.940 --> 37:00.610
I can't even have a dream
without you showing up?

37:00.630 --> 37:02.650
- Get the hell out of here.
- I'm just saying.

37:02.670 --> 37:04.780
You know what? Get out of here.

37:10.260 --> 37:14.320
Gentlemen,I'm sorry.Mr. Garrity
is being prepped for surgery.

37:14.340 --> 37:16.200
So,that means we can't see him?

37:16.220 --> 37:19.130
Probably not till late tomorrow,if then.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.520
Sorry.

37:20.550 --> 37:22.160
Thank you.

37:25.340 --> 37:30.410
It's funny.I mean,I got
no connection to garrity.

37:30.440 --> 37:33.570
Yeah.He's one of the guys,but

37:33.590 --> 37:35.940
that's about it,kind
of a dumbass,too,right?

37:37.370 --> 37:40.320
Something like this
happens,you know--I don't know--

37:40.340 --> 37:42.340
I just want to protect the guy.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.330
I want to take care of him.

37:44.980 --> 37:47.590
I don't want him to be alone.

37:49.270 --> 37:53.740
Jesus christ,I mean,with
cancer,without it,

37:53.760 --> 37:56.000
you're just so alone.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.060
You know what I mean?

38:02.330 --> 38:03.980
Yeah.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.680
Yeah. I do.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.150
<i>{\a6}Mickey Mantle dead of liver cancer at
63 shortly after receiving a liver transplant</i>

39:19.880 --> 39:23.750
Well,let me think a little bit.

39:23.780 --> 39:28.840
I would like to say to the
kids out there to take a good--

39:28.870 --> 39:31.570
you talk about a role model.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.890
This is a role model.
Don't be like me,you know?

39:34.920 --> 39:37.920
I mean, god gave me a body,

39:37.940 --> 39:41.070
ability to play baseball, and
that's what I wanted to do,

39:41.090 --> 39:44.100
give me
everything.I just--

39:52.510 --> 39:55.460
so I want to start
giving something back.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.840
Seems to me like all
I've done is just take,

39:57.870 --> 40:02.770
have fun and take,and I
want to start trying to

40:02.790 --> 40:06.710
work with baylor hospital and
the donor program,stuff like that.

40:06.720 --> 40:13.920
It's unbelievable.Like I said,I want to
spend the rest of my life trying to make up.
