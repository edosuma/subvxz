00:15.290 --> 00:17.190
Shit.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.857
What did you do?

00:18.858 --> 00:19.824
What did I do?

00:19.825 --> 00:21.524
You ruined my shoe.

00:21.525 --> 00:23.797
<i>And you just put a
footprint on the Mona Lisa.</i>

00:23.798 --> 00:26.030
Did you see the swirl
on that masterpiece,

00:26.031 --> 00:28.385
the form, the texture, the
taper of the pinch point?

00:28.386 --> 00:30.818
Why do I bother?
You don't know shit.

00:30.819 --> 00:32.304
I'm the one who should be mad.

00:32.305 --> 00:34.139
I have a lot of work to do,
and taking time away

00:34.140 --> 00:35.840
from my desk for these
little walks isn't helping.

00:35.841 --> 00:37.575
Oh, you call this a walk?

00:37.576 --> 00:39.341
You haven't even
asked me about my day

00:39.342 --> 00:40.907
or how much I'm missing Jenna

00:40.908 --> 00:42.708
or what I'm gonna do with my
life now I've finay pulled

00:42.709 --> 00:44.843
the squeaker out of
that sheepskin chew toy.

00:44.844 --> 00:46.209
I'm checking interest rates.

00:46.210 --> 00:47.565
It's been a while
since I've had money

00:47.566 --> 00:49.178
to invest, and I want
to be smart about it.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.736
Yeah, while you're
planning for the future,

00:50.737 --> 00:52.436
you're completely missing
out on the present.

00:52.437 --> 00:54.736
That's why you've been stepping
in shit your whole life.

00:54.737 --> 00:56.270
Things are different now.

00:56.271 --> 00:58.205
I have a job, a girlfriend.
And yet

00:58.206 --> 00:59.673
you still spend all
your time worrying

00:59.674 --> 01:02.642
- about what you don't have.
- Look, it's easy not to worry

01:02.643 --> 01:03.876
when you don't have
any real problems.

01:03.877 --> 01:05.178
Dogs don't have to think

01:05.179 --> 01:08.247
about money or crime
or social injustice.

01:08.248 --> 01:09.681
We don't think
about those things

01:09.682 --> 01:11.450
because our noses keep
us in the present.

01:11.451 --> 01:14.420
We stop and smell the roses,
every goddamn one of them.

01:14.421 --> 01:17.456
Open your nostrils and
smell around you, Ryan.

01:19.159 --> 01:20.493
Dirty diapers,

01:20.494 --> 01:22.194
sour milk puddles,

01:22.195 --> 01:23.929
used tranny ass-condoms.

01:23.930 --> 01:25.630
Dude, we are so lucky
we live in L.A.

01:25.631 --> 01:26.831
We really do have it all.

01:31.269 --> 01:33.671
Have I still got
ants in my teeth?

01:33.672 --> 01:35.705
Who are you talking to?

01:35.706 --> 01:37.675
You know me, Warner,

01:37.676 --> 01:39.142
I'm always interested
in any investment opportunity

01:39.143 --> 01:40.610
you bring my way.

01:40.611 --> 01:43.680
Yeah, okay, sounds good.

01:43.681 --> 01:44.948
All right, I'll see you then.

01:44.949 --> 01:46.382
Hey, Ryan.

01:46.383 --> 01:47.617
Hey, Wilfred.

01:47.618 --> 01:49.018
Hey, Kevin.

01:49.019 --> 01:50.820
Sounded like something
pretty big went down in there.

01:50.821 --> 01:52.488
Sorry about that.

01:52.489 --> 01:54.123
I went to a new Colombian
restaurant last night.

01:54.124 --> 01:55.390
Ooh, Colombian.

01:55.391 --> 01:56.858
I meant on the phone.

01:56.859 --> 01:59.294
Oh, right, duh.

01:59.295 --> 02:02.163
My investment guy is working
on a huge real estate deal.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.499
I'm about to get pizzaid.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.735
Ugh, it's my kid.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.371
I'll see him in the morning.

02:10.372 --> 02:13.107
Whoo, this smells like shit
in here!

02:13.108 --> 02:15.076
Hey, you got some
money laying around?

02:15.077 --> 02:16.278
I could hook you
up with my guy.

02:16.279 --> 02:18.146
Really, you'd do that for me?

02:18.147 --> 02:19.815
I got you this job, didn't I?

02:21.184 --> 02:22.418
I'll hook you up
with an interview.

02:22.419 --> 02:24.320
You don't have
to do that for me.

02:24.321 --> 02:26.155
If you vouch for him, I'm
sure he's fine.

02:26.156 --> 02:27.724
No, no, no, you don't
interview Warner.

02:27.725 --> 02:29.659
Warner interviews you.

02:29.660 --> 02:32.262
He's very picky about the
people he does business with,

02:32.263 --> 02:33.964
but trust me, if you
get in with him...

02:33.965 --> 02:36.100
...You're
gonna be living large.

02:36.101 --> 02:37.334
Give me five.

02:37.335 --> 02:39.603
Oh, ten coming back.

02:39.604 --> 02:41.439
I think I just doubled
your investment.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.607
What, what, what?

02:44.109 --> 02:46.044
So what was that all about?

02:46.045 --> 02:47.812
You thinking about
investing our money?

02:47.813 --> 02:51.449
I thought we were talking
about getting me my own place.

02:51.450 --> 02:53.317
First of all,
it's not our money,

02:53.318 --> 02:55.286
and if, by "your place,"
you mean the doghouse

02:55.287 --> 02:56.988
in the Hammacher Schlemmer
catalog,

02:56.989 --> 02:58.356
that's $9,000.

02:58.357 --> 03:01.359
It's real estate, Ryan.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.829
All that matters is
location, location, location.

03:04.830 --> 03:06.597
I'm thinking Jenna's backyard.

03:06.598 --> 03:08.333
I mean, the schools
are kind of shitty,

03:08.334 --> 03:10.802
but I'm not planning on
having kids anytime soon.

03:14.339 --> 03:16.140
It's like when I'm stalking
a squirrel, all right?

03:16.141 --> 03:17.975
I'm totally in the moment.

03:17.976 --> 03:20.511
I'm not thinking about how
this squirrel is named Craig

03:20.512 --> 03:21.979
and how he's a pretty good guy

03:21.980 --> 03:23.414
and he just came
out to his family

03:23.415 --> 03:26.298
and how happy he is
with nuts in his mouth.

03:27.788 --> 03:29.502
Honestly, I didn't
even mean it like that.

03:29.503 --> 03:30.153
Nice.

03:30.154 --> 03:32.055
Kevin's investment guy wants
to meet for lunch.

03:32.056 --> 03:34.424
You're doing it again, Ryan.

03:34.425 --> 03:35.892
You're not living in the now.

03:35.893 --> 03:37.094
So what?

03:37.095 --> 03:38.595
Why do you suddenly
care so much?

03:38.596 --> 03:40.264
I'm just trying to
get you to savor

03:40.265 --> 03:42.299
what little time you have left.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.068
What are you talking about?

03:44.069 --> 03:48.806
Look, this isn't how I
wanted you to find out.

03:48.807 --> 03:50.574
Find out what?

03:52.277 --> 03:54.411
This isn't an easy
thing to tell you.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.581
Ryan, you're dying.

03:58.617 --> 04:00.618
It's true.

04:00.619 --> 04:04.122
Not long after we
met, you were asleep

04:04.123 --> 04:08.225
and I was carefully placing
my hair in the water glass

04:08.226 --> 04:12.262
on your bedside table
like I always do.

04:12.263 --> 04:15.266
Well, I smelled something.

04:18.303 --> 04:19.536
It's a tumor.

04:19.538 --> 04:21.339
In-in your brain.

04:21.341 --> 04:24.680
- Dogs can't smell tu...
- We can.

04:25.618 --> 04:27.490
You're lying.

04:27.491 --> 04:29.793
Ryan, do you know
what the symptoms

04:29.794 --> 04:32.198
of a brain tumor are?

04:33.634 --> 04:35.635
Anxiety, blackouts.

04:35.636 --> 04:38.004
Hallucinations.

04:38.005 --> 04:40.308
Any of that sound familiar?

04:42.645 --> 04:44.879
But if that's true...

04:46.853 --> 04:48.926
that means that everything...

04:50.398 --> 04:52.899
Jesus, Wilfred.
What are you doing?

04:52.900 --> 04:56.069
I can't bear
to see you suffer, mate.

04:56.070 --> 04:58.672
I promised myself I'd do
the same thing you'd do for me.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.007
What any friend would do.

05:01.008 --> 05:04.911
I'm... I'm putting you down.

05:04.912 --> 05:06.947
No, this is one
of your little head games.

05:06.948 --> 05:09.048
That-that gun's not... shit!

05:09.049 --> 05:11.417
No, no. No, no,
don't... don't do this.

05:11.418 --> 05:12.518
I'm begging you.

05:14.387 --> 05:16.455
See you on the
rainbow bridge, Ryan.

05:16.456 --> 05:18.223
Oh, please, please, God, no!

05:21.494 --> 05:22.594
Gotcha.

05:24.130 --> 05:27.833
"Gotcha"?
"Gotcha"?

05:27.834 --> 05:30.769
Can't risk the window thing
leading back to me.

05:30.770 --> 05:33.038
Already got a couple of priors.

05:33.039 --> 05:34.473
What the hell is going on?

05:34.474 --> 05:36.274
Ryan, did you feel that?

05:36.275 --> 05:37.542
Exhilarating!

05:37.543 --> 05:39.411
That's living in the moment!

05:39.412 --> 05:42.014
Wouldn't you like to feel
that way all the time?

05:42.015 --> 05:44.283
You're an asshole.

05:45.718 --> 05:47.086
Give me your wallet, bitch.

05:47.087 --> 05:49.621
Oh. Oh, I get it.

05:49.622 --> 05:51.390
This is... this is part
of your little lesson, too?

05:51.391 --> 05:52.858
Hey, who's he talking to?

05:52.859 --> 05:55.895
Ryan, I swear,
I don't know them.

05:55.896 --> 05:57.564
Shut this dog up or I will.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.766
Come on.

06:02.970 --> 06:04.705
This is all your fault.

06:04.706 --> 06:06.507
How come, every time
I follow you somewhere,

06:06.508 --> 06:08.676
- I lose my wallet?
- Stop yelling at me!

06:08.677 --> 06:11.312
I just had a gun
jammed in my face,

06:11.313 --> 06:12.847
you insensitive prick!

06:12.848 --> 06:14.915
Have you any idea how
terrifying that is?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.318
Oh, I am so done with you.

06:17.319 --> 06:18.752
Ryan, Ryan, something's wrong.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.355
I can't...
I can't smell anything.

06:22.356 --> 06:24.157
Maybe I'm just...

06:24.158 --> 06:26.325
Maybe I just need
something stronger.

06:37.870 --> 06:39.871
Nothing.

06:39.872 --> 06:41.539
Can you smell them?

06:43.308 --> 06:45.610
Jesus, what the hell??

06:49.348 --> 06:51.316
Nothing.

06:56.273 --> 06:58.274
No infection.
No obstruction.

06:58.275 --> 06:59.976
So he's faking it.

06:59.977 --> 07:01.478
You mean, is it mental?

07:01.479 --> 07:04.647
Well, dogs can lose their
sense of smell from stress.

07:04.648 --> 07:08.584
Has, uh, Wilfred been in any
stressful situation recently?

07:08.585 --> 07:11.020
Oh, you mean like getting
nostril-raped by a Glock 17?

07:11.021 --> 07:12.855
Not that I can think of.

07:14.357 --> 07:15.924
Listen, keep a close eye on him.

07:15.925 --> 07:17.626
Dogs really rely
on their sense of smell.

07:17.627 --> 07:21.619
Without it, he can get confused
or maybe even lost.

07:22.732 --> 07:24.766
I can't believe
this is happening.

07:24.767 --> 07:27.001
I mean, I've heard of
trauma causing blindness,

07:27.002 --> 07:29.237
like when Stevie Wonder
and Ray Charles

07:29.238 --> 07:31.972
walked in on each other
masturbating.

07:31.973 --> 07:34.007
Well, it serves you right
for that stunt you pulled.

07:34.008 --> 07:35.375
Ryan, you don't understand.

07:35.376 --> 07:37.110
Now that I can't smell,

07:37.111 --> 07:39.445
it's like my brain
has nothing to do.

07:39.446 --> 07:42.114
It's like time
has slowed to a crawl

07:42.115 --> 07:44.683
and my head
is full of these... things.

07:44.684 --> 07:46.751
They're-they're like voices,

07:46.752 --> 07:49.921
constantly questioning
and analyzing.

07:49.922 --> 07:51.489
Those are thoughts, Wilfred.

07:51.490 --> 07:53.325
Thoughts?

07:53.326 --> 07:54.726
You know what you need?

07:54.727 --> 07:56.828
An activity to keep
your mind busy.

07:56.829 --> 07:58.129
Read a book or something.

07:58.130 --> 08:00.198
A book?
Yeah, right.

08:00.199 --> 08:02.367
Maybe if it had pictures.
That moved.

08:02.368 --> 08:04.602
And sound.
And Matt Damon in it.

08:04.603 --> 08:06.904
And in the middle of the movie,
Matt Damon would be like...

08:08.473 --> 08:10.742
Now, there's a book
I'd like to read.

08:15.381 --> 08:17.582
O... kay.

08:19.352 --> 08:20.619
Where were we?

08:20.620 --> 08:22.555
I was just saying,
uh, how Ryan here

08:22.556 --> 08:24.624
is the top dog
of our legal department.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.225
Well, it's-it's easy
to be top dog

08:26.226 --> 08:27.960
when you're the only one
in the department.

08:32.799 --> 08:36.836
Wait, that's not the same UPS
guy that comes to my house.

08:36.837 --> 08:40.073
Wait, so... so there's
more than one UPS guy.

08:40.073 --> 08:41.975
Of course!

08:41.976 --> 08:43.610
It's all so clear to me now.

08:43.611 --> 08:45.879
The uniform changes guys.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.114
O... kay.

08:47.115 --> 08:49.816
Where were we?

08:49.817 --> 08:51.951
I was just saying that
I'm not only the top dog,

08:51.952 --> 08:53.720
but I'm also the bottom dog.

08:53.721 --> 08:56.890
Don't be modest.
It's a weak trait.

08:56.891 --> 09:00.426
Oh, I just meant I'm the...
only one in the department.

09:03.063 --> 09:04.631
So, when
Jenna leaves the house

09:04.632 --> 09:07.067
and I can't see her anymore,

09:07.068 --> 09:08.802
she doesn't cease to exist.

09:08.803 --> 09:11.672
She's just somewhere else?

09:11.673 --> 09:13.407
No, no, no, no,
that's just crazy.

09:13.408 --> 09:15.075
O... kay.

09:15.076 --> 09:18.045
Well, it was nice meeting
you, Kevin's friend.

09:18.046 --> 09:20.147
Uh, uh, Warner, um...

09:20.148 --> 09:21.849
Don't know if you
know this or not,

09:21.850 --> 09:23.618
but Ryan here
is Hank Newman's son.

09:23.619 --> 09:26.087
Oh, is that so?

09:26.088 --> 09:29.023
That's true, but I don't want to
ride on my father's coattails.

09:29.024 --> 09:30.525
Don't apologize for nepotism.

09:30.526 --> 09:33.528
So, Hank's son,
here's the deal...

09:33.529 --> 09:36.730
A half a million square feet

09:36.731 --> 09:38.866
of luxury commercial
space downtown.

09:38.867 --> 09:40.968
Right now, it's just
abandoned buildings

09:40.969 --> 09:43.103
and unused land.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.804
But when it's done,

09:44.805 --> 09:47.807
it will be the place
to buy $16...

09:49.276 --> 09:51.711
Sixteen...
Uh-uh, shh.

09:51.712 --> 09:54.113
Lattes.

09:54.114 --> 09:57.917
So, look over this prospectus.

09:57.918 --> 10:00.286
I'll let you know
if I'm interested.

10:00.287 --> 10:03.560
Ryan, I'm starving.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.391
This thinking is a lot of work.

10:05.392 --> 10:07.259
Can we please stop
somewhere on the way home?

10:07.260 --> 10:09.461
There's seriously... There's
nothing to eat around here.

10:11.731 --> 10:13.466
Guess what.
Warner just called.

10:13.467 --> 10:15.368
He wants to meet me
at the development site.

10:15.369 --> 10:17.470
Kevin says, if this
goes well, I should...

10:20.807 --> 10:23.919
Did you just read
that whole book?

10:25.245 --> 10:28.047
I read all of these books.

10:28.048 --> 10:29.314
What's wrong?

10:29.315 --> 10:32.818
What's wrong?
Where should I start?

10:32.819 --> 10:36.422
Uh, why is there so much
injustice in the world?

10:36.423 --> 10:41.127
Why do some have so much
while so many have so little?

10:41.128 --> 10:44.830
Why are children in Compton
getting fatter and fatter

10:44.831 --> 10:46.465
whilst children in Beverly Hills

10:46.466 --> 10:47.700
are starving
themselves to death?

10:47.701 --> 10:50.102
Why, Ryan? Why?

10:50.103 --> 10:52.104
Uh...

10:52.105 --> 10:54.706
Jesus, put down the bong
and pick up a book.

10:58.511 --> 11:01.179
"Critique of Pure Reason"
by Immanuel Kant.

11:01.180 --> 11:03.582
Ever heard of this Kant?

11:03.583 --> 11:04.949
I love Kant.

11:06.218 --> 11:07.886
Oh, existential
German philosophy

11:07.887 --> 11:10.088
is funny to you.

11:10.089 --> 11:12.891
Wipe that smirk off your face
and listen to this Kant.

11:14.927 --> 11:17.496
"It is not the consequences
of the action

11:17.497 --> 11:19.264
"which make it right or wrong,

11:19.265 --> 11:22.000
but the motivation of the
individual performing the act."

11:22.001 --> 11:23.701
What do you suppose that means?

11:23.702 --> 11:25.836
I don't know.

11:25.837 --> 11:28.746
Uh, you should never
knowingly do bad to others.

11:28.747 --> 11:31.575
Yes. And would that be an ethos

11:31.576 --> 11:33.221
with which you find
not incompatible

11:33.222 --> 11:34.605
with your own beliefs?

11:34.606 --> 11:36.480
I'm-I'm not sure
what you're asking.

11:36.481 --> 11:38.182
Because the most
enlightening thing

11:38.183 --> 11:40.852
I read today
was this prospectus.

11:40.853 --> 11:44.189
That new mall you're
so determined to invest in?

11:44.190 --> 11:46.691
It will mean the destruction

11:46.692 --> 11:48.792
of an important
public works program.

11:48.793 --> 11:51.896
What's the big deal?
This place is a dump.

11:51.897 --> 11:54.731
This park keeps inner-city
dogs off the streets.

11:54.732 --> 11:56.500
They rely on this park

11:56.501 --> 11:58.535
for the programs and
services it offers,

11:58.536 --> 12:01.371
- like free water from the OWBP.
- The what?

12:01.372 --> 12:02.940
The open water bowl project.

12:02.941 --> 12:04.641
Most of these dogs

12:04.642 --> 12:07.244
come from broken homes
with broken fences.

12:07.245 --> 12:09.112
If you're party to the
destruction of this park,

12:09.113 --> 12:10.981
then you're no
better than them.

12:10.982 --> 12:13.316
We'll talk about this later.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.118
Open your eyes, Ryan!

12:15.119 --> 12:17.520
Together, we can make
a difference.

12:23.860 --> 12:26.995
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey, Ryan.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.731
Don't ever apologize
for being late.

12:29.732 --> 12:31.266
It makes you sound
poor, all right?

12:32.969 --> 12:35.404
It's my kid.
Doesn't he have any friends?

12:35.405 --> 12:37.506
Hear our bark!
Save this park!

12:37.507 --> 12:39.808
Hear our bark!
Save this park!

12:39.809 --> 12:41.410
Excuse me for one second.

12:41.411 --> 12:42.845
Hear our bark!
Save this park!

12:42.846 --> 12:45.181
Hear our bark!
Save this park!

12:45.182 --> 12:46.548
Oh, hi, Ryan.

12:46.549 --> 12:47.983
How did you get
the car doors unlocked?

12:47.984 --> 12:49.084
I read the manual.

12:49.085 --> 12:50.519
Excuse me, sir.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.721
Do you have 30 seconds
to help save the world?

12:52.722 --> 12:54.490
Have a nice day.
Hope your children enjoy

12:54.491 --> 12:55.824
the wasteland
you're leaving them.

12:55.825 --> 12:57.092
Wilfred, get back in the car

12:57.093 --> 12:58.360
before you blow
this deal for me.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.661
Look, I'm sorry,
but I can't ignore

12:59.662 --> 13:01.096
what's right in front of me.

13:01.097 --> 13:02.998
Hear our bark!
Save this park!

13:02.999 --> 13:05.700
Hear our bark!
Save this park!

13:05.701 --> 13:07.168
Everything okay, Ryan?

13:07.169 --> 13:08.603
Here they are,
the one-percent

13:08.604 --> 13:10.339
here to profit
off the k-99%!

13:10.340 --> 13:13.909
Let's get 'em, boys!

13:13.910 --> 13:15.544
Sorry, my dog got out
of the car.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.079
You hear that?

13:17.080 --> 13:19.615
I will not be contained,
corporate pigs!

13:19.616 --> 13:23.820
All right, brass tacks.
Minimum buy-in's $10,000.

13:23.821 --> 13:25.822
Wait. So, does that mean...?

13:25.823 --> 13:27.257
Yeah. You're in!

13:27.258 --> 13:29.125
I need an answer now.

13:29.126 --> 13:31.481
- We're signing the deal tomorrow.
- Here's your answer.

13:31.482 --> 13:33.149
Whoa! Hey, hey,
Ryan, your dog!

13:33.150 --> 13:34.765
- Wilfred!
- In my mouth.

13:34.766 --> 13:36.734
What the hell are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

13:36.735 --> 13:38.402
You're putting these dogs
out on the street.

13:38.403 --> 13:40.104
Look, I know you're
looking for something to do

13:40.105 --> 13:41.305
now that you've lost
your sense of smell...

13:41.306 --> 13:43.374
What I've lost
in my sense of smell,

13:43.375 --> 13:44.909
I've gained
in my sense of humanity.

13:44.910 --> 13:46.211
And now I'm appealing to yours.

13:46.212 --> 13:48.012
I'm trying to do
the right thing here,

13:48.013 --> 13:50.148
but I can't do it alone.

13:50.149 --> 13:51.316
Wilfred, I'm trying
to be responsible

13:51.317 --> 13:52.750
and plan for my future.

13:52.751 --> 13:55.953
To hell with the future!
I need you right now!

13:55.954 --> 13:58.656
Ryan, I really care about this.

13:58.657 --> 13:59.924
I need you to care, too.

13:59.925 --> 14:01.392
The only thing I'm signing

14:01.393 --> 14:02.893
is that investment
agreement tomorrow.

14:02.894 --> 14:04.061
Ryan...

14:04.062 --> 14:05.596
Ryan!

14:08.032 --> 14:09.899
Ryan.

14:17.070 --> 14:19.806
What are you doing down here
in the dark?

14:19.807 --> 14:22.141
There's darkness
everywhere, Ryan.

14:22.142 --> 14:23.743
You just can't see it

14:23.744 --> 14:25.311
because the sun
is such an attention whore.

14:30.117 --> 14:31.418
Jesus!

14:31.419 --> 14:32.786
What is the matter with you?

14:32.787 --> 14:34.421
Are you still mad

14:34.422 --> 14:35.923
because I didn't sign
your little petition?

14:35.924 --> 14:37.491
- Get over it.
- Why would I be mad?

14:39.327 --> 14:40.995
Uncaring, unfeeling.

14:40.996 --> 14:45.100
Seven billion narcissists
all alone together

14:45.101 --> 14:46.869
on a big, dead rock.

14:46.870 --> 14:49.672
What's the point of anything?

14:49.673 --> 14:52.175
Life reeks of hopelessness.

14:52.176 --> 14:53.977
I'm just glad I can't
smell it anymore.

14:53.978 --> 14:56.580
<i>Camus, Sylvia Plath,
Marley and Me.</i>

14:56.581 --> 14:58.181
Maybe you should stop reading.

14:58.182 --> 15:01.184
Do you know what
I dreamt last night?

15:08.759 --> 15:10.393
Nothing.

15:13.665 --> 15:15.833
I have to meet Warner
in an hour.

15:15.834 --> 15:17.235
Have you seen my checkbook?

15:17.236 --> 15:20.037
I can't find it anywhere.

15:20.038 --> 15:23.074
So nice to see you so
concerned about something.

15:23.075 --> 15:25.776
Look, when we get back,
maybe we can go for a walk.

15:25.777 --> 15:27.044
A walk.

15:27.045 --> 15:30.381
Such a futile exercise.

15:30.382 --> 15:32.484
Let's go for... hang on.

15:36.722 --> 15:40.091
Let's go for a walk
around the block.

15:40.092 --> 15:44.295
Around and around and
around in circles

15:44.296 --> 15:46.763
on a meaningless journey to...

15:49.700 --> 15:50.967
- Are you done?
- Yes.

15:50.968 --> 15:52.335
Let's go.

15:52.336 --> 15:54.303
I don't want to be late.
I'm not going anywhere.

15:54.304 --> 15:56.572
Fine. Then don't come.

15:56.573 --> 15:57.807
So you're
just gonna leave me alone?

15:59.577 --> 16:01.177
Remember what the doctor said?

16:01.178 --> 16:03.380
I don't think you'll get lost
in the basement.

16:03.381 --> 16:06.249
I'm already lost, Ryan.

16:10.388 --> 16:12.055
Man, I love jalapenos.

16:12.056 --> 16:14.458
I swear, these things are gonna
be my downfall.

16:18.697 --> 16:21.465
What's up with you and Amanda?
You guys a thing?

16:21.466 --> 16:22.667
Yeah. I mean, we're dating.

16:22.668 --> 16:24.102
She looks hot in that lab coat.

16:24.103 --> 16:27.272
Bet she likes to shoop!

16:33.980 --> 16:35.747
When do you think
Warner will get here

16:35.748 --> 16:37.249
- with the papers?
- I'd get comfortable.

16:37.250 --> 16:39.751
Warner's gonna join us
whenever he feels like it.

16:39.752 --> 16:41.653
That's one of the things
about being rich.

16:41.654 --> 16:43.655
You get to treat
everybody else like shit.

16:43.656 --> 16:44.957
I can't wait.

16:46.559 --> 16:49.295
Oh, no, no!
My God!

16:49.296 --> 16:51.363
My kid just got a piercing.
Look at that.

16:51.364 --> 16:53.498
What is that, his chin?

16:53.499 --> 16:54.966
It's his scrotum.

16:54.967 --> 16:57.669
- Oh!
- God. He did it to himself.

16:57.670 --> 16:58.971
Butchered it, too.

16:58.972 --> 17:01.206
He's on the way
to the hospital.

17:01.207 --> 17:03.875
What do you want me
to tell Warner?

17:03.876 --> 17:05.743
What do you mean?

17:05.744 --> 17:07.679
Don't you have to get
to the hospital?

17:07.680 --> 17:09.281
Yeah, right.
And then Warner finds out

17:09.281 --> 17:10.582
that I left? Game over.

17:10.583 --> 17:12.017
So I didn't go to your

17:12.018 --> 17:14.319
little rock opera
that you wrote for school.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.188
Get over it!

17:16.189 --> 17:18.390
K.J., what have you done

17:18.391 --> 17:21.193
to your beautiful
little scrotum?

17:21.194 --> 17:22.895
Excuse me.
Can you give me a minute?

17:26.833 --> 17:28.600
This is Wilfred.

17:28.601 --> 17:31.270
Please leave a... whatever.

17:31.271 --> 17:34.473
If this is Ryan, good-bye.

17:34.474 --> 17:37.843
And if this is Bear,
I'll see you in hell!

17:38.512 --> 17:40.446
Tell Warner I'm sorry.

17:40.447 --> 17:41.714
What? Where are you going?

17:41.715 --> 17:45.085
Hey, you're not going to get
a second chance at this, Ryan.

17:45.086 --> 17:46.853
I can't think
about the future right now.

17:46.854 --> 17:47.921
Ryan!

17:49.858 --> 17:51.258
Wilfred?

17:58.132 --> 17:59.733
Wilfred!

17:59.734 --> 18:01.868
You're okay.

18:01.869 --> 18:04.570
Hello, Ryan.

18:04.571 --> 18:06.872
What the hell was that
voice mail greileting?

18:08.375 --> 18:10.276
I miss smelling things, Ryan.

18:10.277 --> 18:13.245
I'm tired of thinking.

18:13.246 --> 18:15.981
I'm like a lost puppy

18:15.982 --> 18:17.783
wandering through
the wilderness,

18:17.784 --> 18:21.086
desperately trying
to find my way home.

18:21.087 --> 18:25.223
And then I realize
I have no home.

18:25.224 --> 18:28.794
Wilfred, you have a home.

18:30.563 --> 18:32.564
Is this about that doghouse?

18:34.067 --> 18:36.068
That's why you made me
blow that deal...

18:36.069 --> 18:38.237
so I'd get you that
$9,000 doghouse?

18:38.238 --> 18:40.071
It's not about the doghouse.

18:40.072 --> 18:43.007
I was trying to buy myself
a little peace of mind.

18:43.008 --> 18:44.509
Well, guess what.

18:44.510 --> 18:45.877
Your little plan's
not gonna work.

18:45.878 --> 18:48.073
And you can drop the
whole emo act.

18:48.074 --> 18:48.980
You look ridiculous.

18:48.981 --> 18:51.182
And why are you wearing
that leash?

18:51.183 --> 18:52.816
You hate leash...

18:55.220 --> 18:57.688
No, no, no, no, no, no!

19:05.864 --> 19:08.500
No! No-no-no-no-no-no!
No, no!

19:08.501 --> 19:10.468
Not again!
I can't lose you again!

19:14.506 --> 19:15.772
I'm sorry!

19:15.773 --> 19:17.975
I wasn't paying attention.

19:17.976 --> 19:20.311
I lost track
of what's really important,

19:20.312 --> 19:22.013
what's right in front of me.

19:22.014 --> 19:24.382
Right here, right now!

19:28.087 --> 19:30.989
Wilfred, you're alive.

19:30.990 --> 19:34.259
Guess I am.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.829
By the way,
your breath smells disgusting.

19:36.830 --> 19:38.163
Come to papa.

19:38.164 --> 19:41.033
Hey, you got your smell back.

19:41.034 --> 19:44.104
I do.

19:44.105 --> 19:46.740
Wilfred, you're my best friend.

19:46.741 --> 19:50.210
If you want your own doghouse,
we'll get you one.

19:50.211 --> 19:53.147
I just can't spend $9,000.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.849
I understand.

20:01.256 --> 20:02.523
I love you, Wilfred.

20:02.524 --> 20:04.258
Stingy prick.

20:04.259 --> 20:06.293
What?

20:06.294 --> 20:08.028
I said I love you, too.

20:14.736 --> 20:17.704
You know, all this time
you've been neglecting me,

20:17.705 --> 20:20.340
I guess I've kind of
been neglecting Bear.

20:22.610 --> 20:25.012
I'm just gonna go see
how Bear's doing.

20:27.382 --> 20:30.551
Oh, God!

20:35.890 --> 20:38.058
Bear!

20:39.327 --> 20:42.229
Oh, Bear, I'm sorry!

20:42.230 --> 20:44.064
I lost sight of what's
really important,

20:44.065 --> 20:45.665
what's right in front of me!

20:45.666 --> 20:47.534
Right here, right now!

20:47.535 --> 20:50.170
Oh, Bear!
