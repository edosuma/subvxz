<i>Previously on</i> teen wolf...

00:02.203 --> 00:03.435
<i>The Ghost Riders,
how do we stop 'em?</i>

00:03.437 --> 00:04.937
We can find a person
to absorb the lightning.

00:04.939 --> 00:07.606
Whatever happens
will be your responsibility.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.743
<i>Where's my sister?</i>

00:10.745 --> 00:12.277
<i>You killed her, remember?</i>

00:12.279 --> 00:14.546
I can help. I know about the Wild Hunt
from the dread doctors.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.614
<i>Where's Stiles?</i>

00:15.616 --> 00:17.683
To not tear you
in half right now.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.752
Somehow I don't think
we're gonna hug this out.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.489
Theo...

01:10.970 --> 01:14.406
Theo...

01:33.927 --> 01:36.428
Theo...

02:20.206 --> 02:21.573
Theo...

03:03.283 --> 03:05.951
Theo...

03:35.715 --> 03:36.782
No, Tara, don't.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.260
<i>Theo...</i>

04:00.206 --> 04:03.542
Theo...

04:12.986 --> 04:14.353
Theo...

04:47.153 --> 04:48.420
It's okay.

04:50.923 --> 04:52.391
You don't have to stop.

05:51.384 --> 05:52.818
It's okay,
you don't have to stop.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.220
Trust me, I won't.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.123
Malia, enough! Hey.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.294
Slow down, okay?

06:02.296 --> 06:04.129
He's going back in the ground.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.397
You can't.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.866
He remembers Stiles.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.603
Scott remembers Stiles.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.772
Lydia and I remember Stiles.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.041
The dread doctors knew
all about the Wild Hunt.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.309
He can help us.

06:17.311 --> 06:18.977
Or he could kill us.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.946
He's my responsibility.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.547
Noshiko gave me the sword.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.016
It's so awkward
when mom and dad fight.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.952
Shut up!

06:26.954 --> 06:31.256
If Theo tries anything, we'll send him
back to the skinwalkers.

06:31.258 --> 06:34.526
But for right now...
He goes back now.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.129
- Except Liam's the one with the sword.
- Shut up!

06:43.569 --> 06:46.037
Malia... Can you give me a
second alone with Theo?

06:46.039 --> 06:48.707
Why?
So I can kill him.

06:49.308 --> 06:50.842
Okay, look,

06:50.844 --> 06:53.111
I know that there's
mixed feelings all around.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.416
But I might be your only
option to stop the Wild Hunt.

06:59.118 --> 07:00.519
Let's kill him.

07:01.487 --> 07:02.988
What, you don't trust me?

07:02.990 --> 07:05.657
I don't trust him. Do you?

07:05.659 --> 07:08.493
No. But I think
we can use him.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.061
Remember who he is.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.799
He got into your head
and you tried to kill me.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.835
And when that didn't work,
he did kill me.

07:16.837 --> 07:20.071
And Tracy, and Josh,
and his sister.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.841
But this might be our only
chance to get Stiles back.

07:22.843 --> 07:26.011
Can't we just try to find somebody
that we at least trust?

07:26.579 --> 07:28.513
This might be a mistake.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.115
But you don't know that yet.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.185
When you were learning
to be an Alpha.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.353
Yeah, I made a lot.

07:35.355 --> 07:38.623
But we don't have time
for mistakes.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.626
I can't lose Stiles.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.764
So we should try anything
we can to save him.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.166
Right?

07:51.304 --> 07:52.571
Even Theo.

07:57.076 --> 07:58.143
Convince me.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.746
I can put you back
in the ground anytime.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.652
That can handle five billion
joules of electricity.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.724
I know where to find one and
I can show you how it works.

08:14.527 --> 08:17.162
I'll tell you if Malia
promises not to kill me.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.367
She promises.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.635
No, I don't.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.204
We're really gonna do this?

08:26.906 --> 08:28.006
Trust him?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.541
You got a better idea?

08:31.310 --> 08:32.644
I've got an idea.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.080
It may not be better.
But at least it's not him.

09:29.268 --> 09:30.335
Noah.

09:31.470 --> 09:32.804
Come out of there.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.641
Did you know about this room?

09:36.643 --> 09:38.977
Why was it sealed off?

09:38.979 --> 09:42.247
The previous owners
probably did it. I...

09:42.249 --> 09:43.815
People do crazy things.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.353
What if this was his room?

09:51.324 --> 09:54.059
What if this means we had a son?

09:54.894 --> 09:55.961
Noah...

09:57.296 --> 09:59.831
Claudia, this could be
the proof we're looking for.

09:59.833 --> 10:03.468
There are so many simple
explanations for why this is here.

10:03.470 --> 10:06.204
But we had a son we've forgotten

10:06.206 --> 10:07.706
is not one of them.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.275
Aren't you curious?

10:11.210 --> 10:13.044
No. I'm not.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.183
You're making yourself crazy.

10:19.652 --> 10:22.387
I think we should just
leave it alone.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.028
I can't.

10:47.613 --> 10:48.813
This was a bad idea.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.315
It's not a bad idea.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.150
It is a terrible idea.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.255
I told you where
the transformer is.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.290
I told you how it works.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.292
I don't need to be there
when it all blows up.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.328
It's not going to blow up.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.796
They ride the lightning.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.331
We can use that to catch one

11:06.333 --> 11:08.633
and keep him there until
we figure out what they want.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.101
It's a good idea.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.203
You're trying to catch
a Ghost Rider.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.106
A million things can go wrong.
Terrible idea.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.575
The bad idea
was bringing him back.

11:17.577 --> 11:20.345
Scott's right.
This is a mistake.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.281
You took a risk.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.883
We took a risk.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.986
But it was
the right thing to do.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.127
I believe in you.

11:49.308 --> 11:50.948
You guys want me
to leave you alone?

11:53.746 --> 11:56.715
Oh, that's right, I can't.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.453
We better hurry.

12:15.301 --> 12:16.768
You did it.

12:17.369 --> 12:18.436
Of course we did it.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.401
This thing can transmute the
energy from a lightning bolt.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.056
Even successive strikes.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.559
Mason, are you sure
this is gonna work?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.027
Well, whatever's inside
this cage

12:43.029 --> 12:45.663
is shielded from any
outside electrical current.

12:45.665 --> 12:48.967
So the Ghost Rider won't be
able to use lightning to escape.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.602
We put a lightning rod
on the roof

12:50.604 --> 12:52.137
and connected it
to that conduit cable.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.905
Drawing the Ghost Rider
to that spot.

12:53.907 --> 12:58.042
We can't send him directly in because
the cage neutralizes electromagnetism.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.345
Lightning will just
bounce off it.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.047
Which is the same reason
it'll hold him in.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.316
If the Ghost Rider lands here,

13:06.085 --> 13:07.752
how do we get him in the cage?

13:07.754 --> 13:09.587
We have to lure him in.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.523
Bait?
I'll do it.

13:13.692 --> 13:14.893
It'll be okay.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.194
I'm faster than you.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.930
As soon as Hayden's out,
Scott and Liam,

13:19.832 --> 13:22.400
you guys close the gates,

13:22.402 --> 13:24.369
and then I'll put down
a barrier of mountain ash.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.070
I'll be on the roof
to take down the rod.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.573
We'll be on the lookout
for any other Ghost Riders.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.508
What do you think?

13:33.779 --> 13:35.980
I think it's the best idea
that we have right now.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.582
As long as everything
goes perfectly

13:37.584 --> 13:39.551
and he doesn't escape
and kill us all.

13:39.553 --> 13:41.052
And your transformer works

13:41.054 --> 13:42.787
and the whole place
doesn't catch on fire.

13:42.789 --> 13:45.323
And there isn't
a catastrophic solar flare.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.525
Let's do it.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.027
Okay.

14:14.987 --> 14:18.056
He has third degree burns
over 90% of his body.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.426
I should be telling you
to say your goodbyes.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.661
It's Peter. I don't need
to say goodbyes.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.029
I need you to fix him

14:25.031 --> 14:26.998
so we can find out what he
knows about the Wild Hunt.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.167
Remember who we're dealing with.

14:30.002 --> 14:32.503
Your father
is a ruthless con man

14:32.505 --> 14:35.740
who always has a devious plan
to hurt everyone around him.

14:35.742 --> 14:38.109
What happens when he gets up
out of that bed?

14:39.044 --> 14:40.478
You got a plan of your own?

14:41.280 --> 14:42.347
I have a plan.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.616
I don't know if it's devious.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.117
At least it's a plan.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.229
I can't promise this will work.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.032
You said he was dying anyway.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.001
What does he have to lose?

15:03.003 --> 15:05.169
I can hear you.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.906
I'm not dead yet.

15:11.310 --> 15:14.345
I think they put that there
to protect me.

15:14.347 --> 15:18.082
Glad to see you're obeying
hospital protocols.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.286
Your daughter asked me
to treat you.

15:25.891 --> 15:28.059
In exchange for what?

15:29.962 --> 15:31.596
Told you, you needed a plan.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.801
She helps you, you help me.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.870
That's a bit open-ended.

15:38.872 --> 15:41.239
What if I don't agree
to your conditions?

15:41.840 --> 15:43.508
I leave you for dead.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.546
So, what exactly do you know
about our kind of medicine?

15:52.685 --> 15:54.485
I know about the nine herbs.

16:12.504 --> 16:13.371
Think it's working?

16:13.373 --> 16:15.273
Should be.
Looks painful enough.

16:35.194 --> 16:37.595
You know we never did
have that second date.

16:48.274 --> 16:51.709
Still thinking about how to
prove the Riemann hypothesis?

16:51.711 --> 16:54.579
I'm thinking about a dead kid
I met in Canaan.

16:55.214 --> 16:56.280
Dead?

16:56.915 --> 16:58.583
He drowned in 1985.

17:00.719 --> 17:02.854
Okay.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.122
Go on.

17:05.924 --> 17:07.625
His mom conjured him.

17:09.127 --> 17:12.597
To fill the void she felt after the
Wild Hunt passed through Canaan.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.233
Mom...

17:17.336 --> 17:19.537
What if sheriff Stilinski
is filling a void?

17:20.406 --> 17:22.373
What if he's filling it
with Claudia?

17:24.175 --> 17:26.544
You think Claudia's dead?

17:28.547 --> 17:31.949
No, I... I just saw her.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.419
So many things don't make sense.

17:36.088 --> 17:39.490
She had a fatal disease,
but then she's fine.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.692
She says her Jeep
was stolen 20 years ago,

17:41.694 --> 17:43.094
but it's Stiles'.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.462
Oh, you should have seen
the look on her face

17:44.464 --> 17:46.831
when I peeled back
the wallpaper.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.533
She wasn't just angry.

17:48.535 --> 17:49.801
She was scared.

17:51.036 --> 17:53.071
Like she was protecting
a secret.

17:53.772 --> 17:54.839
Okay.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.210
If this is true, then...

18:00.045 --> 18:02.346
Maybe sheriff Stilinski
needs this.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.649
Maybe it's his way of coping.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.453
What if Claudia being here

18:08.455 --> 18:11.622
is preventing him
from remembering Stiles?

18:14.293 --> 18:15.393
Lydia,

18:16.195 --> 18:18.629
if Claudia isn't real,

18:18.631 --> 18:20.798
you don't want to be
the one to tell him.

19:04.776 --> 19:05.843
Come on.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.323
Keep closing it.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.276
Go! Go!

20:17.082 --> 20:18.950
It worked.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.051
We did it.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.485
Yeah. We did.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.427
You knew about it, didn't you?

21:07.466 --> 21:09.467
God, it was on the blueprints.

21:10.369 --> 21:11.435
It was here when we moved in.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.838
That was 18 years ago.

21:43.802 --> 21:44.869
Lydia?

21:46.938 --> 21:48.005
What is it?

21:57.749 --> 21:59.784
Nothing.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.887
I don't understand how you
knew this was here.

22:05.624 --> 22:08.459
If you want to discuss
the possibility

22:10.729 --> 22:12.096
that I had a son...

22:15.133 --> 22:16.400
I'm listening.

22:31.983 --> 22:33.517
Now what do we do?

22:34.219 --> 22:36.053
Try and talk to him.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.621
Mr. Ghost Rider?

22:37.623 --> 22:39.924
Mr. Rider?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.761
We'll let you out

22:43.763 --> 22:45.529
if you tell us how to
get our friends back.

22:46.765 --> 22:49.400
Everyone.
We want everyone back.

22:49.402 --> 22:50.801
Tell us how to get 'em all back.

22:53.872 --> 22:54.939
This is the plan?

22:56.408 --> 22:58.376
There wasn't a plan
for this part of the plan.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.543
It's okay.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.779
Look, we got him trapped.
He can't get out.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.941
We just have to figure out
how to communicate with him.

23:06.852 --> 23:08.386
Maybe he can't hear us.

23:09.254 --> 23:11.021
Maybe he speaks
an ancient language.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.692
Maybe he only responds to pain.

23:15.093 --> 23:16.260
Or fear.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.329
Nothing's gonna scare
this thing. Look at him.

23:18.331 --> 23:19.830
He's a walking corpse.

23:20.298 --> 23:21.565
Something's wrong.

23:22.434 --> 23:23.868
Why'd he stop trying to get out?

23:33.145 --> 23:34.678
Did he just call for backup?

23:35.814 --> 23:37.381
When Corey made
the Ghost Rider visible

23:37.383 --> 23:40.117
at the party, another
one showed up.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.254
We have to figure out
how to talk to him.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.855
Or else get
the hell out of here.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.562
Where's Corey?

23:51.997 --> 23:53.063
He's over there.

23:56.968 --> 23:58.068
How did you know?

23:58.070 --> 24:00.004
How did you know?

24:00.006 --> 24:04.975
There's a refraction of light around your
silhouette that I can always see.

24:06.478 --> 24:07.778
I don't know, it probably
has something to do

24:07.780 --> 24:10.214
with pheromones or some other
chemical interaction.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.684
It's my only power.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.052
Finding you.

24:16.488 --> 24:18.289
Did you see anything
on your end?

24:18.291 --> 24:20.224
No. It's all clear.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.725
I wish we knew
what was happening.

24:24.363 --> 24:25.563
Anything?

24:25.565 --> 24:27.198
They can't get him to talk.

24:31.169 --> 24:32.570
They were communicating.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.638
Who?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.540
I was wrong about him.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.275
Well, no, I was right about him.

24:38.277 --> 24:39.810
Actually, I was wrong about him

24:39.812 --> 24:41.846
but I was right
about the wrong thing.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.380
Who are we talking about here?

24:43.382 --> 24:44.748
Parrish.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.383
Remember how I thought
that the Ghost Riders

24:46.385 --> 24:48.452
were scared of him?
At the party?

24:48.454 --> 24:50.254
I think that he was
actually trying

24:50.256 --> 24:51.589
to communicate with him.

24:52.424 --> 24:53.724
On your knees.

24:57.963 --> 25:00.664
On your knees.

25:19.985 --> 25:21.051
We need Parrish.

25:22.153 --> 25:23.220
So, wait a sec.

25:23.222 --> 25:26.690
So, this woman "Lenore,"

25:26.692 --> 25:30.027
she conjured up her dead son?

25:31.263 --> 25:33.397
She was the only one left.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.199
She had to fill a void.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.967
So she filled it with her son.

25:37.969 --> 25:40.804
And you saw this kid?

25:40.806 --> 25:41.739
We all did.

25:41.741 --> 25:44.241
He was real.
He was there.

25:46.778 --> 25:47.845
But...

25:48.179 --> 25:50.381
But what?

25:50.383 --> 25:52.983
She was there
when everybody was taken.

25:52.985 --> 25:54.785
She saw it happen.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.556
But she didn't wanna believe it.

25:59.457 --> 26:02.192
She wanted to believe
in her son.

26:04.329 --> 26:05.729
What are you trying to say?

26:07.632 --> 26:11.802
You think Claudia is not real?

26:11.804 --> 26:16.707
You think
I made up a phantom wife?

26:16.709 --> 26:18.609
You're afraid to remember him.

26:19.344 --> 26:21.879
She's a flesh and blood woman.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.081
She's real.

26:25.216 --> 26:26.750
Everything else here is just...

26:26.752 --> 26:29.553
Is just speculation.
Conjecture.

26:29.555 --> 26:32.356
It's just,
it's a theory based on a...

26:33.491 --> 26:35.326
On a Ghost town.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.330
You don't see anything?

27:48.700 --> 27:51.201
I see a deeply disturbed
young woman.

27:53.038 --> 27:54.238
You're afraid to remember him

27:54.240 --> 27:56.707
because you're afraid
of what it means.

27:57.942 --> 28:01.245
Why do you care so much
if I remember him?

28:01.846 --> 28:03.447
Because you loved him.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.298
That's progress.

28:59.537 --> 29:01.171
Ask him how we get
everyone back.

29:02.006 --> 29:03.774
Tell us how we get
everyone back.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.416
What was that?
Did he say something?

29:12.884 --> 29:14.718
He said "hellhound".

29:14.720 --> 29:16.320
Is that a good thing?

29:21.860 --> 29:24.695
Take the next left,
cut over to the highway.

29:24.697 --> 29:26.063
And then don't stop.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.165
We have a deal.

29:29.467 --> 29:31.802
I'm not leaving without Stiles.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.104
You're so very loyal, Malia.

29:34.106 --> 29:38.041
And that is
an overrated quality.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.326
You know, I was in pretty
bad shape when you found me.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.962
I don't really have a clear
picture of where I was.

29:59.597 --> 30:00.864
I marked the territory.

30:01.933 --> 30:04.134
Visually.
I marked it visually.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.576
But we didn't see
where you came out.

30:06.504 --> 30:07.871
It's a supernatural rift, Malia,

30:07.873 --> 30:09.840
it's not the golden gate bridge.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.942
I doubt we can even see it,
let alone get through.

30:13.111 --> 30:14.978
This is a horrible
waste of time.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.314
You promised me.
On your death bed.

30:19.684 --> 30:22.853
I just saw a kid get burned alive
trying to escape the Hunt.

30:22.855 --> 30:25.589
You try and save Stiles,
he's gonna die the same way.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.624
Humans can't get through.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.827
Then we'll find another way
to get him out.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.562
But first we have to get in.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.232
You have no
self-preservation instincts.

30:35.867 --> 30:37.401
How are you my daughter?

30:41.739 --> 30:43.006
Ask him again.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.010
What do you want from us?

30:47.012 --> 30:52.182
We are the Wild Hunt.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.284
We hunt forever.

30:54.286 --> 30:59.056
Those who hunt
with us hunt forever.

30:59.757 --> 31:01.658
What does that mean?

31:01.660 --> 31:03.527
Tell us what you want.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.897
We are the Wild Hunt.

31:06.899 --> 31:11.668
Those who hunt
with us hunt forever.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.303
That clarifies things.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.105
What do we have to do
to get everyone back?

31:16.040 --> 31:17.975
Do you want something from us?

31:21.246 --> 31:23.547
Why's he looking at Scott?

31:27.218 --> 31:29.953
He figured out
Scott's the Alpha.

31:29.955 --> 31:31.822
There must be
something you want.

31:31.824 --> 31:34.524
There is only the Hunt.

31:34.526 --> 31:39.630
No one resists.
No one escapes.

31:40.665 --> 31:41.798
If they can't be bargained with,

31:41.800 --> 31:43.300
we're gonna have to fight 'em.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.437
I'm comin' for my friends.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.006
I'm comin' for everyone.

31:49.807 --> 31:51.775
I won't stop.

31:51.777 --> 31:54.077
I'll never stop until
we get everyone back.

32:02.153 --> 32:05.122
Parrish? What's happening?

32:05.124 --> 32:06.189
Scott...

32:24.943 --> 32:26.243
What is he doing?

32:27.412 --> 32:28.645
He's gonna set him free.

32:33.818 --> 32:38.021
I think you need to admit that you have
an unhealthy attachment to Stiles.

32:38.023 --> 32:39.323
You got to let him go.

32:39.325 --> 32:42.559
Would you please
try to behave like a human?

32:42.561 --> 32:43.794
I need Stiles for that.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.996
Why? Is he
your human crutch?

32:46.698 --> 32:48.598
He's my anchor.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.100
I'll get you a new anchor.

32:50.735 --> 32:52.035
He's not comin' back.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.137
He was hunted.
He got caught.

32:55.006 --> 32:56.273
You don't believe that.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.208
You risked your life
to bring us his keys.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.143
I risked my life
to escape the Hunt.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.713
Not to reunite
sentimental teenagers.

33:02.715 --> 33:04.481
You wanted us
to know about Stiles.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.949
And Canaan.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.517
You were warning us.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.655
This is where we found you.

33:14.258 --> 33:15.325
Like I said,

33:16.060 --> 33:17.627
there's nothin' here.

33:17.629 --> 33:18.729
You're not even looking.

33:18.731 --> 33:19.963
You can't just poke around

33:19.965 --> 33:23.000
and expect to find
a supernatural train station.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.440
Do you hear that?

33:42.720 --> 33:45.155
Nothing.
Same here.

33:47.158 --> 33:49.192
How do you think it's going?

33:49.194 --> 33:50.727
I bet it's working.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.267
Hey, hey, Parrish,
Parrish, stop!

34:08.079 --> 34:09.545
No!

34:12.183 --> 34:13.717
Yeah, we need to do something.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.652
Yeah. On three.

34:16.655 --> 34:19.723
One, two, three!

34:57.795 --> 34:59.629
Have you been here
the whole time?

35:00.531 --> 35:02.265
How could I stay away?

35:09.407 --> 35:11.675
Maybe you should tell them
who you really are.

35:15.513 --> 35:17.180
<i>Hauptmann?</i>

35:36.968 --> 35:38.301
It's them?

35:38.303 --> 35:41.938
And judging by the sound,
we don't have a lot of time.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.039
For what?

35:43.041 --> 35:44.574
For you to run.

35:44.576 --> 35:45.675
You're leaving me?

35:45.677 --> 35:48.845
But if we can hear them,
it must be close.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.414
There'll be another chance.

35:53.751 --> 35:54.918
Go now.

35:56.521 --> 35:58.588
Malia, run! Go!

36:23.681 --> 36:25.715
Break the barrier.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.856
Break the barrier,
or I'll rip you in two.

36:59.016 --> 37:00.650
It's been a long time.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.815
Don't follow me.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.762
What did you do?

39:25.764 --> 39:27.697
It was Mr. Douglas.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.900
He ate his brain.

39:32.703 --> 39:33.870
Scott was right.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.739
I was wrong.

39:37.408 --> 39:38.942
I'm sending you back.

39:42.513 --> 39:43.947
It wasn't his brain.

39:44.782 --> 39:46.850
Mr. Douglas ate
his pineal gland.

39:48.986 --> 39:50.887
It couldn't have been Theo.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.556
These murders have been
going on for weeks.

39:55.926 --> 39:59.062
Guys. His whip's gone.

40:20.985 --> 40:22.419
Mr. Douglas?

40:26.290 --> 40:27.791
What are you doing?

40:27.793 --> 40:32.962
Something I have been waiting
to do for a very long time.
