03:06.475 --> 03:09.875
<i>Headquarters, we are still</i>
<i>in pursuit of the black Lamborghini.</i>

03:10.175 --> 03:13.274
<i>Car 42, you've been in pursuit</i>
<i>for two hours.</i>

03:13.474 --> 03:15.874
<i>Another five minutes,</i>
<i>and you'll be in Arizona.</i>

03:16.074 --> 03:19.474
<i>Yeah, and we're gonna stay in pursuit</i>
<i>until we catch him.</i>

03:19.673 --> 03:22.773
<i>It didn't take us that long</i>
<i>to catch Dillinger.</i>

03:46.369 --> 03:47.369
Hi, guys.

03:57.567 --> 04:00.067
- You're two hours late.
- I'm sorry.

04:00.167 --> 04:02.097
Where the hell you been?

04:03.014 --> 04:05.066
I'm sorry.

04:07.025 --> 04:09.565
Fuel-injection system...
It's driving me crazy.

04:09.765 --> 04:13.165
I'm really sorry I'm late, but one
of my hamsters had an anxiety attack.

04:13.365 --> 04:15.245
I couldn't leave him
until he was settled down.

04:15.365 --> 04:18.363
He was acting so crazy.
He ate a piece of tail.

04:18.564 --> 04:21.064
And Henrietta wasn't even
bothering him.

04:21.164 --> 04:23.562
Then he ate his treadmill.

04:27.262 --> 04:30.262
They got vets for that.
We got other things to worry about.

04:30.461 --> 04:33.561
Hamsters are a big responsibility.

04:33.761 --> 04:36.361
Let me paint you a mental picture,
all right, Victor?

04:36.807 --> 04:39.860
I want you to think of your hamsters
as a little army...

04:40.114 --> 04:41.960
marching along on a treadmill...

04:42.160 --> 04:45.459
running their little legs off,
running as fast as they can...

04:45.659 --> 04:48.659
making that engine just
purr right along the road.

04:48.925 --> 04:53.458
Oh, J.J. What a wonderful way
to put it.

04:56.158 --> 05:00.257
Wouldn't it be great if we could share
winning the Cannonball with them?

05:00.457 --> 05:05.157
That would be a real team effort...
you, me, the hamsters and him.

05:20.353 --> 05:24.153
Don't start with him.
I don't want to talk about him.

05:24.489 --> 05:27.952
- If you need any help...
- I don't want to talk about him.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.951
- Sir James!
- Oh, my God. You again?

05:38.142 --> 05:40.051
Fenderbaum, do me a favor.

05:40.151 --> 05:42.250
You're drawing flies.
Get the hell out of here.

05:42.450 --> 05:44.750
Wait a minute, Greek.
Only thing I want to know is...

05:44.950 --> 05:48.449
how are you figuring the odds
on this Cannonball cockamamie?

05:48.549 --> 05:51.249
It takes brilliance
and years of hard work...

05:51.349 --> 05:53.249
and you wouldn't understand
any part of that.

05:53.349 --> 05:56.248
Do me a favor.
A race is a race, right?

05:56.348 --> 05:59.148
The only thing you gotta do
in the Cannonball is drive steady...

05:59.448 --> 06:01.348
stay out of trouble
and have a good cover.

06:01.448 --> 06:04.547
3,000 miles averaging
85 miles an hour.

06:04.747 --> 06:06.239
Do you know what that is?

06:06.547 --> 06:09.347
You want to talk
or do you want to bet?

06:09.547 --> 06:12.946
Anti-radar paint,
turbocharged, J.J.

06:13.146 --> 06:16.522
Nobody can stop us now.
Nobody.

06:32.053 --> 06:35.642
What are you, some kind of nut?
Who do you think you are?

06:38.581 --> 06:40.841
I am Captain Chaos.

06:43.104 --> 06:47.140
And this...
This is my faithful companion, Cato.

06:47.477 --> 06:49.340
Say hello, Cato.

06:51.659 --> 06:53.239
Been a cop long?

06:56.239 --> 06:58.739
Funny!
You wanna talk or you wanna bet?

06:59.041 --> 07:01.878
- You got 50 to 1.
- And you know what you got?

07:02.027 --> 07:03.938
You got yourself a bet.

07:04.138 --> 07:07.233
Twenty big large ones.

07:07.537 --> 07:09.750
That's a million dollars.

07:10.037 --> 07:11.637
If you win.

07:11.837 --> 07:15.935
I don't know if you know my partner.
Jamie, you remember Jimmy the Greek.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.436
Jamie Blake.

07:19.649 --> 07:21.834
You used to drive
that Formula One...

07:22.034 --> 07:24.034
when high-button shoes
were in style.

07:24.234 --> 07:26.434
Let me tell you something, Greek.

07:26.634 --> 07:28.225
We got a secret weapon.

07:28.533 --> 07:32.133
- God is our copilot.
- You'll need him.

07:36.432 --> 07:39.332
"God is our copilot"?

07:39.554 --> 07:41.602
- Remember our car?
- Yeah.

07:41.732 --> 07:44.034
- Two seats?
- Two seats.

07:44.631 --> 07:48.031
Where's he gonna sit?
Where?

07:50.135 --> 07:51.930
Listen to me, El Porko.

07:52.162 --> 07:56.029
We're not in the Indianapolis 500.
We can't have a car with numbers on it.

07:56.471 --> 07:59.829
- We have to camouflage the car somehow.
- Like what, J.J.?

08:00.077 --> 08:02.529
How about a limousine
with diplomatic plates?

08:04.728 --> 08:07.228
I know. A bloodmobile.

08:07.328 --> 08:09.828
They'd never stop
a bloodmobile, would they?

08:10.128 --> 08:12.826
Ice cream truck!
An ice cream truck!

08:13.026 --> 08:14.946
You know. They got to get there
before it melts.

08:19.025 --> 08:20.525
Terrific.

08:20.725 --> 08:22.725
- We're out of beer, Victor.
- Sorry.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.505
Take it easy! You're acting crazy
since this Cannonball thing!

08:26.724 --> 08:28.924
I'm gonna pull in here
and get some beer, all right?

08:33.023 --> 08:36.123
How about an armored personnel carrier?
They wouldn't stop that, would they?

08:51.221 --> 08:54.220
Hey, don't bother to park.
I'll be right out.

09:06.937 --> 09:07.867
Thank you.

09:07.967 --> 09:10.817
We could get a black Trans Am.
No, that's been done.

09:35.632 --> 09:38.981
Hello, Mother.
I trust you've had a pleasant day.

09:39.258 --> 09:41.713
A nightmare.
A living nightmare.

09:41.913 --> 09:43.912
You are killing me, Seymour...

09:44.122 --> 09:48.412
killing me a slow death
with this idiot spy business.

09:48.712 --> 09:52.411
- Mother, you don't understand.
- What is there to understand?

09:52.611 --> 09:56.211
I'm looking at my son,
Seymour Goldfarb, jr...

09:56.709 --> 09:59.310
son of Seymour Goldfarb,
God rest his soul...

09:59.610 --> 10:02.610
and heir to the Goldfarb Girdles
fortune.

10:02.982 --> 10:04.608
And what is he doing?

10:04.808 --> 10:06.708
Walking around, acting...

10:06.908 --> 10:10.320
like he was some goy movie star
named Roger Moore.

10:10.534 --> 10:13.007
And for this I sent you
to the best schools?

10:13.457 --> 10:16.742
For this I'm spending 8,000
on orthodontia work?

10:16.807 --> 10:20.106
For this I'm going broke
paying that Beverly Hills analyst?

10:20.306 --> 10:21.706
And now...

10:21.906 --> 10:22.906
this.

10:24.406 --> 10:27.805
The sleep-in maid found it
under your pillow this morning.

10:27.905 --> 10:30.105
What is the meaning of this?

10:30.205 --> 10:32.804
The meaning, Mother dear,
is a quick death.

10:33.004 --> 10:35.704
I warned you not to interfere
in my affairs.

10:36.004 --> 10:39.143
Seymour, put that away.
It's liable to go off.

10:39.633 --> 10:41.603
I'm terribly sorry, Mother...

10:41.873 --> 10:44.003
but you know too much.

10:44.369 --> 10:46.003
You see, in my business...

10:46.202 --> 10:50.102
even the deepest family relationships
aren't worth a farthing.

10:50.599 --> 10:52.178
Farthing, schmarthing.

10:56.001 --> 10:57.447
Zie gezunt, Mama.

11:00.399 --> 11:02.499
Where did I go wrong?

11:02.599 --> 11:04.999
You know something, Mama?
You're too jewish.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.298
Of course, we could always go
with a nice, plain-jane Chevy...

11:09.498 --> 11:11.898
with a truckload
of Sidewinder missiles.

11:12.198 --> 11:14.697
J. J., maybe you should slow this down
just a little bit.

11:14.897 --> 11:18.197
- I can't hear you.
- I said, you're making waves.

11:18.397 --> 11:21.297
- You're bothering the people.
- What the hell does going too fast...

11:21.497 --> 11:24.296
got to do with being
in the Cannonball?

11:24.596 --> 11:27.596
J. J., you're making very big waves.

11:27.796 --> 11:29.996
How are ya?

11:41.894 --> 11:45.893
You guys are lucky.
You tore the heck out of that boat.

11:46.193 --> 11:48.793
- You all right, Victor?
- Oh, I'm fine, J.J.

11:48.993 --> 11:51.892
It only hurts when I point.

11:52.092 --> 11:54.092
You know, maybe
it would've been better...

11:54.192 --> 11:57.090
if you didn't pay
so much attention to those girls.

11:57.190 --> 11:59.190
- Nobody's perfect.
- That's true.

11:59.290 --> 12:01.190
Nobody's perfect...

12:01.390 --> 12:02.790
but him.

12:05.332 --> 12:06.089
Sorry.

12:06.289 --> 12:07.889
How far is it
to the hospital?

12:07.989 --> 12:09.839
- About ten miles.
- Oh, yeah?

12:09.939 --> 12:11.788
How long will it take us
to get there?

12:11.988 --> 12:13.288
About four or five minutes.

12:13.488 --> 12:16.288
You can smoke through traffic like
shot through a gun in this thing.

14:11.969 --> 14:13.058
Camel.

14:13.369 --> 14:15.669
Not the Camel, schmuck. Winston.

14:48.063 --> 14:50.783
Starting tomorrow, you and George
will be riding in the car with me.

14:51.063 --> 14:52.063
Yes, sir.

15:00.962 --> 15:02.961
How goes your driving, my brother?

15:03.061 --> 15:05.261
Allah be praised, dear sister.

15:05.461 --> 15:09.360
My speed is rivaled only by
the lightning bolts from the heavens.

15:14.905 --> 15:17.459
And I suppose you still intend
to go through that race...

15:18.062 --> 15:19.459
with the infidel Americans.

15:19.982 --> 15:21.559
Cannonball will fall...

15:21.759 --> 15:23.858
to the forces of Islam!

15:24.058 --> 15:27.158
My dear sister, I pledge it!

15:27.599 --> 15:29.857
Drink! Drink!

15:29.957 --> 15:32.257
- The car will be there, correct?
- Yes, Mr. Compton.

15:32.357 --> 15:34.457
Don't forget to cancel
the board meeting on Monday.

15:34.657 --> 15:37.856
I'm going to spend a week
in Spain at the castle.

15:38.056 --> 15:41.056
- Yes, Mr. Compton.
- I want you to find an old friend...

15:41.256 --> 15:43.156
a Mr. Shakey Finch.

15:43.356 --> 15:46.754
He is the finest long-distance
motorcycle rider in this nation.

15:47.054 --> 15:48.954
- You got it?
- Yes, Mr. Compton.

15:50.354 --> 15:54.453
Mr. Compton, the board has asked me
to express their concern one more time.

15:54.753 --> 15:57.553
- Please reconsider.
- Not possible, Arthur.

15:57.653 --> 16:00.552
The board will have to permit me
this one indulgence...

16:00.752 --> 16:02.152
to my ego.

16:08.013 --> 16:10.751
~ <i>I've gotta be free</i> ~

16:11.256 --> 16:14.541
~ <i>I've gotta be me</i> ~

16:14.904 --> 16:16.248
~ <i>To live</i> ~

16:25.102 --> 16:27.590
~ <i>Got to be free</i> ~

16:27.696 --> 16:30.542
- Boy, ain't he something?
- Are you kidding?

16:30.691 --> 16:32.788
That is the dumbest thing I've seen
since that dimwit...

16:32.948 --> 16:34.747
tried to jump the Grand Canyon.

16:40.057 --> 16:41.545
He's still on our ass.

16:41.645 --> 16:43.045
I don't think...
I don't think...

16:43.245 --> 16:44.945
I don't think he's a brother either.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.744
Don't you worry, son.
I'm gonna lose him up here at the motel.

16:48.944 --> 16:51.844
Hey, I remember.
There's a spot...

16:52.044 --> 16:55.043
There's a spot right in back...

16:55.243 --> 16:57.043
and it's a perfect spot to hide.

16:57.243 --> 16:59.543
All right. Wonderful, wonderful.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.243
- Take... Take...
- Left.

17:01.343 --> 17:03.242
Oh, hell. Take a left.

17:06.041 --> 17:08.442
I can't see shit, can you?

17:08.642 --> 17:10.840
No problem, son.
No problem.

17:13.540 --> 17:14.641
What was that?

17:27.005 --> 17:29.339
That's... That's... That's...

17:31.238 --> 17:32.530
perfect.

17:33.064 --> 17:34.536
That's better than hiding...

17:34.938 --> 17:37.236
- That's better than hiding it out back.
- I know.

17:37.436 --> 17:39.336
But the only problem
we got now...

17:39.436 --> 17:41.836
is we have to go and retune it.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.236
All right?
Let's go get a beer first.

17:44.435 --> 17:46.935
Yeah, let's go get... Let's... Beer.

17:49.299 --> 17:51.934
I'd like to thank Mona Carson
of Westport...

17:52.243 --> 17:54.333
for that wonderful combination
of hemp sandwiches...

17:54.504 --> 17:57.034
and wood chip consomme.

17:57.234 --> 18:01.033
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.233
This is a titty turn...

18:03.433 --> 18:05.433
terrific turnout for the meeting.

18:05.632 --> 18:07.732
- Yes, terrific.
- He led the campaign...

18:07.932 --> 18:12.132
to ban the use of electric toothbrushes
during peak load hours.

18:13.931 --> 18:16.131
I suppose you...

18:16.331 --> 18:18.131
came here to hear me speak.

18:18.331 --> 18:21.930
No, not really.
I'm into trees.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.030
Trees.

18:26.829 --> 18:28.679
Friends of Nature love trees,
you know...

18:28.779 --> 18:30.629
so I come to the meetings.

18:30.942 --> 18:33.417
That's very interesting.

18:33.609 --> 18:35.721
I love anybody who loves trees.

18:35.927 --> 18:39.327
They happen to be
a great passion of mine.

18:39.817 --> 18:41.926
You know what I like
best about trees?

18:42.185 --> 18:44.916
- No, what?
- That you can lie under them...

18:45.108 --> 18:47.626
on a moonlit night
with the breeze blowing...

18:47.726 --> 18:49.290
ball your brains out.

18:50.527 --> 18:52.625
Mr. Arthur J. Foyt.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.524
Mr. Foyt.

19:03.223 --> 19:04.863
Give that sucker some juice.

19:05.055 --> 19:10.005
The only thing hiding it...
hiding it... hiding it in the pool...

19:10.389 --> 19:13.122
did was make it pretty.

19:13.504 --> 19:15.522
It ain't running worth a shit.
And it's wet!

19:15.722 --> 19:18.221
I know that. Just hit it
one more time, all right?

19:19.921 --> 19:23.221
Hold it! Hold it!
I know what's wrong.

19:23.421 --> 19:25.320
Don't think for a minute...

19:25.520 --> 19:28.720
that we in Washington...

19:28.920 --> 19:31.518
don't appreciate your Mothers' March...

19:31.618 --> 19:35.072
to ban the sale
of colored toilet paper...

19:35.307 --> 19:38.017
to help reduce irritation...

19:38.217 --> 19:40.517
of the rectum.

19:43.840 --> 19:44.816
But today...

19:45.398 --> 19:48.016
I want to direct my remarks...

19:48.216 --> 19:49.616
to an old...

19:49.816 --> 19:52.715
and familiar enemy...

19:53.889 --> 19:55.115
the automobile.

19:55.815 --> 19:57.715
One more time.
Let me hear it.

20:03.914 --> 20:07.213
It reminds me of a poem...

20:07.413 --> 20:09.013
I wrote.

20:09.413 --> 20:12.113
"The automobile, the automobile..."

20:27.211 --> 20:28.809
Are you all right?

20:29.009 --> 20:31.509
They picked on the wrong one
this time!

20:31.609 --> 20:34.308
I guarantee
they're gonna pay for this...

20:34.408 --> 20:37.008
because when the going gets tough,
the tough get going.

20:40.308 --> 20:42.707
She's running good now, buddy.

20:42.907 --> 20:45.007
I still think
we ought to paint it.

20:45.107 --> 20:48.307
If we're gonna paint it, let's go ahead
and Midasize it, all right?

20:52.906 --> 20:54.206
There's the motel.

20:54.306 --> 20:57.105
The Cannonballers have the parking lot
all jammed up.

20:57.405 --> 20:59.905
Man, I can't handle this traffic.

21:00.005 --> 21:02.705
Hold on to your lunch pail.
This may get a little weird.

21:02.904 --> 21:04.004
Wait a minute.

21:06.104 --> 21:07.104
Slow down!

21:15.534 --> 21:17.402
You the one running this flea bag?

21:17.502 --> 21:19.736
- Where are the hookers?
- What?

21:19.950 --> 21:22.202
Hookers, man.
Where are the hookers?

21:22.402 --> 21:23.833
Excuse me.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.100
- Hello, Mad Dog.
- Hey, J.J.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.680
You probably didn't realize this,
but the parking lot's outside.

21:30.780 --> 21:32.599
Yeah, I know.
Brakes went out.

21:32.857 --> 21:34.999
- You think you're the president?
- Well...

21:35.396 --> 21:37.699
let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

21:37.956 --> 21:40.998
We feel terrible about it.
And if they can't take a joke...

21:43.998 --> 21:46.397
Thank goodness. We just had
a terrible accident.

21:46.597 --> 21:48.497
We'd like to help you,
but we're off duty.

21:48.597 --> 21:51.097
This man looks bad.
Maybe he's dead.

21:51.197 --> 21:54.396
Then you should call the coroner.
J. J., he don't look too good.

21:57.860 --> 22:00.228
- I think he just had his bell rung.
- Can't you do something?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.298
You're professionals.

22:02.980 --> 22:04.295
This is our day off.

22:04.452 --> 22:08.228
Will you guys do something?
This man's life is hanging by a thread.

22:17.210 --> 22:20.666
You have to be scientific. It could go
up the nostrils, affect the sinuses.

22:20.815 --> 22:22.032
That's true.

22:32.229 --> 22:34.747
There.
Don't bother about the bill.

22:34.989 --> 22:37.243
Just give him
a couple of enemas...

22:37.840 --> 22:39.589
and call me in the morning.

22:41.289 --> 22:43.088
- Hi. How's it going?
- Perfect.

22:43.288 --> 22:46.088
We'd like two singles.
J.J. McClure, Victor Prinzim.

22:46.388 --> 22:47.611
I'll be in the bar.

22:48.638 --> 22:50.887
I always like a couple drinks
right after surgery.

22:58.257 --> 23:00.166
I wonder why that guy
parked his truck in the lobby.

23:00.386 --> 23:02.686
Only in America.
Get me 12 suites.

23:02.886 --> 23:05.185
- Better yet, the entire floor.
- Yes, sir.

23:07.494 --> 23:09.030
Too much couscous.

23:09.985 --> 23:11.984
I would sure as H
like to get my hands...

23:12.084 --> 23:14.984
on those Hell's Angels
who were driving that truck.

23:16.384 --> 23:18.182
But you know, it's probably
just as well...

23:18.382 --> 23:21.582
because I am a wild bull
when I lose my temper.

23:23.582 --> 23:25.481
I love wild bulls.

23:29.381 --> 23:32.753
It's really funny that you should...
Oh, my God. It's them.

23:32.839 --> 23:34.460
- "Them" who?
- Those Hell's Angels.

23:34.588 --> 23:36.722
They could be part
of a terrorist group.

23:36.935 --> 23:38.280
I don't know.

23:40.079 --> 23:42.268
This place is filling up...

23:42.738 --> 23:45.279
with some real hoodlums.

23:46.087 --> 23:48.278
Do you see anything weird back there?

23:49.863 --> 23:51.442
I'm gonna find out.

24:02.576 --> 24:05.586
I don't understand why it's
so difficult for you to find a doctor.

24:05.776 --> 24:09.875
It's very, very hard. It's not easy
finding a doctor to take off like that.

24:10.075 --> 24:12.485
- Dr. Gay doesn't even leave his house.
- You don't understand.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.773
If you're going to win and you're
driving an ambulance, you need a doctor.

24:17.473 --> 24:20.373
- What does Dr. Gay do?
- He's my shrink.

24:20.691 --> 24:22.440
- He was committed yesterday.
- Why?

24:22.675 --> 24:25.172
He was smoking bananas.

24:25.372 --> 24:28.271
He gets very upset
when he talks to him.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.071
So do I.

24:31.571 --> 24:34.707
Sorry.
I don't want fruit in my drink.

24:38.670 --> 24:40.275
Congratulations.

24:40.531 --> 24:42.469
Here's to you.
Good luck.

24:45.469 --> 24:47.166
You dumb shits.

24:47.401 --> 24:49.069
They haven't got a chance.

24:49.269 --> 24:50.768
You know what?

24:50.968 --> 24:54.268
I think I'm gonna call the Greek
and put another 10,000 on us.

24:58.167 --> 25:00.009
What about those two?

25:00.180 --> 25:03.067
Maybe one of those beauties
could be our patient.

25:03.508 --> 25:05.620
Both of them could be.

25:05.766 --> 25:08.066
I could be very patient
with those patients.

25:09.766 --> 25:11.530
They're very lick...
very likeable.

25:11.764 --> 25:15.064
Tell you what. Let's go over there
and talk to them.

25:15.364 --> 25:17.064
- Okay.
- I'll do all the talking.

25:18.591 --> 25:20.682
You just think about the doctor.

25:31.262 --> 25:32.961
- Good evening, ladies.
- Hello.

25:33.482 --> 25:36.661
My name is J.J. McClure, and this is
Victor Prinzim, my executive assistant.

25:36.861 --> 25:38.761
- Hi.
- I'll do the talking, Victor.

25:39.008 --> 25:41.060
Terrorists, my dimpled ass.

25:41.260 --> 25:45.560
These people make terrorists look like
the Sisters of Charity.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.547
These guys are Cannonballers.

25:51.859 --> 25:53.664
What is that, a bowling team?

25:53.835 --> 25:56.478
As you probably know, we're
the favorites to win the Cannonball...

25:56.578 --> 25:58.478
and I was wondering if one of you
or both of you...

25:58.578 --> 26:00.357
might like to ride
in the winning vehicle.

26:00.557 --> 26:02.957
That would be very exciting.

26:03.057 --> 26:04.557
Exciting.

26:04.657 --> 26:06.757
But we're Cannonballers ourselves,
thank you.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.918
They're Cannonballers.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.755
As for the winning vehicle...

26:10.955 --> 26:13.055
we'll just have to wait and see.

26:13.255 --> 26:14.554
You haven't seen our equipment.

26:17.054 --> 26:18.219
Equipment?

26:52.949 --> 26:54.466
Don't tell me your name.

26:54.849 --> 26:56.407
Let me guess.

27:12.024 --> 27:13.645
I'll just call you Beauty, okay?

27:13.845 --> 27:15.595
That's nice.

27:15.928 --> 27:17.245
Thank you.

27:17.656 --> 27:18.944
Sit down.

27:23.459 --> 27:24.944
Are you one of those volleyballers?

27:25.044 --> 27:27.343
Cannonballers. No.

27:27.543 --> 27:28.943
Why are you dressed like that?

27:30.072 --> 27:31.943
Humanitarian reasons.

27:32.143 --> 27:35.142
I'm a wealthy philanthropist.

27:35.576 --> 27:37.442
Me and my partner ride around
in an ambulance...

27:37.642 --> 27:40.376
Looking for accidents,
trying to help people.

27:41.941 --> 27:44.141
I don't think we were put
on this earth to hurt people.

27:44.341 --> 27:46.141
I think we were put
on this earth to...

27:46.341 --> 27:47.840
help people.

27:47.940 --> 27:50.340
- That's beautiful.
- Thank you.

27:50.702 --> 27:53.240
You must be a sensitive person.

27:53.561 --> 27:54.539
I try to be.

27:54.905 --> 27:57.239
I bet you're a fan of Rod McKuen.

27:57.614 --> 27:59.039
I listen to him every night.

27:59.492 --> 28:04.237
I'm into trees.
Have you ever heard of Joyce Kilmer?

28:04.637 --> 28:06.637
She wrote a terrific poem
about a tree.

28:06.837 --> 28:07.837
He.

28:08.516 --> 28:09.336
Who?

28:09.636 --> 28:12.036
- He.
- He's a she?

28:12.271 --> 28:13.336
She's a he.

28:14.836 --> 28:18.435
Well, he wrote a really terrific
poem about a tree.

28:19.935 --> 28:22.634
- You know what I like best about trees?
- No, what?

28:22.834 --> 28:25.534
That you can lie under them
on a moonlit night...

28:25.634 --> 28:27.734
the leaves gently
blowing in the trees...

28:30.447 --> 28:31.333
Sorry.

28:31.876 --> 28:35.233
It's all right.
What were you saying about trees?

28:35.433 --> 28:39.232
I was saying,
what I like best about trees...

28:39.532 --> 28:43.431
is that, on a moonlit night
you can lie under them...

28:43.674 --> 28:46.021
with the leaves gently blowing...

28:46.128 --> 28:49.231
Hey, J. J., you'll never believe
what just happened to him.

28:49.431 --> 28:51.941
- I don't want to talk about it.
- He had the most wonderful time...

28:52.041 --> 28:54.730
I don't want to talk about him.
Victor, Beauty. Beauty, Victor.

28:54.930 --> 28:57.928
- Hello, Victor.
- You really are.

28:58.228 --> 29:00.918
- Do you want to hear about the doc?
- He's telling me about the doctor.

29:01.018 --> 29:02.838
- Oh, it's about the doctor.
- It's really important.

29:02.938 --> 29:05.427
- We need a doc for the ambulance.
- It'll keep.

29:05.627 --> 29:07.227
I'll leave you two alone.

29:07.327 --> 29:10.576
- But listen, I think you should hear...
- It'll keep!

29:11.027 --> 29:13.584
- It's really important.
- I want to talk to her.

29:14.426 --> 29:15.426
Who?

29:17.926 --> 29:19.386
Now do you want to hear
about the doc?

29:19.486 --> 29:21.825
- No!
- It'll keep.

29:24.525 --> 29:27.324
Hey, Brad, old buddy!
How the hell are you?

29:28.924 --> 29:31.424
My God, it is you.
Hello, Shakey!

29:34.323 --> 29:36.723
Shakey, it's kind of tough
to get close to you.

29:36.923 --> 29:39.223
Last time I saw you,
you were a bit more svelte.

29:39.423 --> 29:42.183
Yeah, well, what can I tell you?
In the pizza business, when it's slow...

29:42.283 --> 29:45.022
you tend to eat the inventory.

29:45.122 --> 29:47.421
But that's not good for the Cannonball.
You know that.

29:47.621 --> 29:49.821
You don't need a motorcycle.
You need the Super Chief.

29:51.521 --> 29:54.121
Even with the extra tonnage,
I'm still the best there is.

29:54.319 --> 29:56.419
Yeah? Well, I'll tell you what.

29:56.619 --> 29:59.819
I got a throttle that's been sticking.
Why don't you fix that?

30:00.007 --> 30:02.918
Boss, this is the biggest coup...

30:03.118 --> 30:05.618
in the history
of the safety enforcement unit.

30:06.918 --> 30:09.217
We're gonna blow this
Cannonball thing wide open...

30:09.317 --> 30:11.717
and then we're gonna hit congress
for a real budget...

30:11.917 --> 30:14.317
that will allow us to play
some real hardball.

30:14.417 --> 30:16.516
I mean, this is
our Three Mile Island...

30:16.616 --> 30:18.816
and Love Canal combined.

30:21.916 --> 30:25.315
- What's wrong?
- Look at the chicks.

30:26.815 --> 30:28.315
- What is it?
- Look at the chicks!

30:30.314 --> 30:32.814
If we were Methodists...

30:32.914 --> 30:36.314
what a shot we could have had
of getting laid right here.

30:38.013 --> 30:41.013
Listen, I want to get up there.
I don't want to miss a thing.

30:43.013 --> 30:46.312
All right. There you go.
Just as good as new. Give her a try.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.312
- That's it?
- That's it.

30:48.435 --> 30:50.412
All right.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.710
We'll see.

30:53.910 --> 30:56.710
Hey, I don't think it's the throttle.
I think it's the clutch!

30:57.010 --> 30:58.675
Good-bye.

30:59.309 --> 31:01.609
Look out!
Hey, watch out!

31:01.809 --> 31:03.409
Watch out!

31:05.009 --> 31:07.508
Coming through!

31:14.607 --> 31:16.907
What in the hell was that?

31:17.107 --> 31:20.006
That must be the entry
of the National Safety Council.

31:52.401 --> 31:53.701
Good day.

31:53.801 --> 31:56.900
I am here to participate
in your little jaunt to California.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.600
Well, of course.
If you would sign in here, please.

32:04.199 --> 32:06.499
Hold still, Petey.
Say cheese.

32:08.099 --> 32:11.098
I realize the novelty
of a major celebrity...

32:11.298 --> 32:13.198
entering your little race...

32:13.298 --> 32:16.797
but kindly resist the temptation and
keep the media coverage to a minimum.

32:17.097 --> 32:19.097
- Thank you.
- Will you hurry the hell up?

32:35.895 --> 32:37.394
Hurry up!

32:51.391 --> 32:55.191
Man does not live
on... on bread alone.

32:55.391 --> 32:58.721
What concerns me is, do we have
enough ice for all this beer?

33:00.090 --> 33:01.490
Plenty.

33:01.790 --> 33:04.690
Yeah, well, how about food, son.
Did you bring enough food?

33:05.989 --> 33:07.092
Plenty.

33:07.284 --> 33:09.069
Will you get serious?
Give me the rest of that beer.

33:19.787 --> 33:21.687
Excuse me, good sisters,
if you will.

33:21.887 --> 33:24.887
Father, we do have a race to run,
and we're running a little late.

33:25.187 --> 33:27.586
So will you come on?
Will you excuse him, good sisters?

33:29.686 --> 33:32.386
- Bye-bye.
- Don't run off. Tonight's the night.

33:34.785 --> 33:36.585
I'd like to welcome you all...

33:36.685 --> 33:39.485
to an event that's sometimes been
called the automotive counterpart...

33:39.685 --> 33:41.240
to the Bay of Pigs.

33:41.987 --> 33:44.983
You all are certainly
the most distinguished group...

33:45.083 --> 33:47.983
of highway scofflaws and degenerates...

33:48.182 --> 33:50.182
ever gathered together
in one place.

33:50.382 --> 33:51.682
We're gonna have fun.

33:51.882 --> 33:55.281
Of course you know certain skeptics
note that perhaps 10,000...

33:55.481 --> 33:57.781
of the nation's most elite
highway patrolmen...

33:57.881 --> 34:01.281
are out there waiting for us after
we start, but let's think positively.

34:01.581 --> 34:04.680
Think of the fact that there is
not one state in the 50...

34:04.880 --> 34:07.080
that has the death penalty
for speeding.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.980
Although I'm not sure about Ohio.

34:10.279 --> 34:12.978
Everybody is gonna get
a card like this.

34:13.179 --> 34:16.578
When you leave, you're gonna
punch out here at this time clock.

34:16.878 --> 34:19.078
Three thousand miles away from here...

34:19.277 --> 34:22.078
is another time clock just like that
at the Portofino Inn.

34:22.277 --> 34:25.877
The difference between the two times
is your time across the country.

34:26.177 --> 34:29.777
The record stands
at 32 hours and 51 minutes.

34:30.179 --> 34:34.275
Believe it or not, those guys did
break the 55 mile an hour speed limit.

34:37.376 --> 34:40.674
Let's get that first car up here.
We're gonna get this thing underway.

34:55.871 --> 34:56.871
Go!

35:02.671 --> 35:04.771
- I know.
- All right. Where's the doctor?

35:04.971 --> 35:06.970
- I got everything else.
- Where's the doctor?

35:07.070 --> 35:09.270
- I got 60 gallons of gas...
- Can you read my lips?

35:09.470 --> 35:11.570
- Where is the doctor?
- The auxiliary tanks...

35:11.770 --> 35:14.189
Goddamn it, I gave you one
responsibility... to get a doctor.

35:14.289 --> 35:16.369
You give me no doctor.
Where is he?

35:16.569 --> 35:18.769
He got sick.

35:18.969 --> 35:21.468
Listen to what I'm telling you.
You go find a doctor.

35:21.668 --> 35:23.768
Get me Dr. Kildare.
Get me Dr. Livingston.

35:23.968 --> 35:25.788
Get me Dr. Frankenstein.
Just get me a doctor.

35:25.888 --> 35:28.167
- Go where the doctors hang out.
- Where is that?

35:28.367 --> 35:29.667
Bars, golf courses.

35:29.867 --> 35:32.560
Golf course, bar. All right.
Where else? Hospital!

35:32.965 --> 35:33.669
Try that too.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.465
My jet will take you to California.

35:36.665 --> 35:39.065
It's time for you to punch out.

35:42.764 --> 35:45.488
I'll see you in California!
I love you!

35:52.017 --> 35:53.663
A toast to us, you and me.

35:53.863 --> 35:56.062
- We're gonna win the whole thing.
- It's a cinch.

35:56.162 --> 35:59.362
The more I look around
and see these turkeys...

35:59.562 --> 36:00.614
I have...

36:03.661 --> 36:06.673
While you're drinking,
that truck to the left...

36:06.861 --> 36:09.361
Isn't that J.J. McClure?

36:09.745 --> 36:11.660
He's nothing.

36:11.860 --> 36:15.860
Don't worry about him.
It's the blimp next to him. The blimp.

36:16.060 --> 36:20.659
When he puts on that mask,
he'll blow your goddamn doors off.

36:21.095 --> 36:23.459
You understand that?
The blimp!

36:32.756 --> 36:34.656
Was that weird?

36:40.255 --> 36:42.455
It's a Nevada license plate...

36:42.555 --> 36:44.555
and that's...

36:44.655 --> 36:46.854
whiskey, zebra, alpha...

36:46.954 --> 36:49.354
niner, fiver, zero.

36:49.454 --> 36:51.354
- You got that?
- What?

36:52.553 --> 36:55.453
Just write W-Z-A...
No, here.

36:55.653 --> 37:00.152
Will you let me do it?
W-Z-A-9-5-0.

37:00.352 --> 37:04.352
See? Whiskey, zebra, alpha,
niner, fiver, zero.

37:10.251 --> 37:14.138
Okay, so it's Interstate 80
through Pennsylvania.

37:14.622 --> 37:17.950
Oh, that's a good looking piece.

37:18.250 --> 37:21.949
And cunningly disguised
so it won't look like a racing car.

37:22.149 --> 37:25.449
You know, the cops would never
give that a second glance.

37:25.749 --> 37:29.047
Two hundred and twenty miles an hour,
and they won't get a second glance.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.147
Hey, when we get to California...

37:31.247 --> 37:34.047
I got a place out at Palos Verdes...

37:34.247 --> 37:37.346
You boys gonna start this thing or just
sit and wait for that paint to dry?

37:39.146 --> 37:40.546
Yes, sir.

37:43.045 --> 37:45.445
- How long till we stop?
- Eight hours.

37:45.645 --> 37:48.445
Damn, I gotta go to the john.

37:56.643 --> 37:57.643
Go.

38:02.243 --> 38:05.542
Mad Dog, you are gonna take the shortcut
to the interstate, aren't you?

38:05.742 --> 38:07.842
We're here to win, ain't we?

38:07.942 --> 38:11.641
If you're gonna be a bear,
be a grizzly.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.290
My God, Pamela.

38:20.501 --> 38:22.101
Did you see that?

38:22.440 --> 38:26.838
They drove right through those trees.
I love trees. Did I tell you...

38:27.138 --> 38:30.138
We are going right down there and bring
this thing to a screeching halt...

38:30.250 --> 38:31.637
right now.

38:31.837 --> 38:34.037
Buckle up.
We're going into action.

38:36.537 --> 38:38.836
Would you mind?

38:39.036 --> 38:41.936
- Very civil.
- Might be easier with your lights on.

38:42.136 --> 38:43.936
Why advertise?

38:45.536 --> 38:47.635
- Wait a minute, Father.
- What?

38:47.835 --> 38:51.335
That's a no-no. Haven't you heard? They
haven't allowed that for 2,000 years.

38:51.535 --> 38:53.934
No, look. I'm a liberal wing.

38:54.134 --> 38:55.934
Way out on the other
part of the church.

38:56.034 --> 38:58.534
- It's nothing at all.
- Keep flying, Father.

39:03.933 --> 39:05.985
How about just one of you?

39:08.732 --> 39:10.932
Who says cops won't stop honeymooners?

39:11.132 --> 39:13.432
Anyhow, why do I
have to be the bride?

39:13.632 --> 39:15.158
Shut up, sweetie,
and punch the clock.

39:16.831 --> 39:20.331
- Okay, go slow until I get my wig on.
- Yes, dear.

39:23.729 --> 39:26.429
Well, old pal of mine,
are we all set for California?

39:28.029 --> 39:31.928
- Next time, Methodist. Methodist!
- All right, pal of mine.

39:32.128 --> 39:34.128
Okay, okay. You're all right.

39:34.328 --> 39:36.527
Okay, now, who's driving?

39:36.727 --> 39:38.127
- You are.
- You're driving.

39:38.227 --> 39:40.927
- I can't drive.
- Then I'm driving.

39:41.127 --> 39:42.626
Yeah, I think you are.

39:42.726 --> 39:44.526
All right.
Put me down.

39:46.326 --> 39:48.626
You hold this.
I'll get in the car.

39:55.625 --> 39:58.424
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

39:58.624 --> 40:00.424
Somebody's hat!

40:06.223 --> 40:07.789
Hold my drink.

40:20.420 --> 40:21.620
Hit it!

40:28.419 --> 40:30.296
Thank you, good sisters.

40:31.319 --> 40:34.718
May the good Lord take a liking to you,
but not too soon.

40:34.918 --> 40:36.818
Bless you, my children.

40:37.018 --> 40:39.717
Those guys are more juiced up
than that Ferrari.

40:54.515 --> 40:56.915
- J. J., wait. I got the doc.
- Terrific.

40:57.015 --> 40:59.415
No, wait.
He's in the ambulance. This way.

41:01.714 --> 41:04.114
Before I open this,
don't get your hopes up too high.

41:04.314 --> 41:06.214
- I was pressed for time.
- No problem.

41:10.703 --> 41:11.913
Holy shit!

41:12.113 --> 41:14.010
I'm honored, sir.

41:14.213 --> 41:16.311
I'm Doctor Nicholas...

41:16.511 --> 41:19.411
Nicholas Van Helsing,
professor of proctology...

41:19.611 --> 41:21.263
and other related tendencies.

41:21.477 --> 41:23.910
Graduate of the University
of Rangoon...

41:24.110 --> 41:25.610
and assorted night classes...

41:25.810 --> 41:28.815
at the Knoxville, Tennessee,
College of Faith Healing.

41:29.309 --> 41:32.009
You may be a little
overqualified for this job.

41:32.209 --> 41:33.936
You got your equipment with you?

41:34.128 --> 41:36.408
I never go anywhere without it.

41:36.608 --> 41:39.908
However, in my particular line of work,
I seldom need more than this.

41:43.728 --> 41:44.858
Or this.

41:51.406 --> 41:53.106
We'll talk about this later.

41:53.563 --> 41:56.506
Now, sir, before we commence
this odyssey...

41:56.806 --> 41:59.605
which I understand will carry us
across this grand nation...

41:59.805 --> 42:01.705
from sea to shining sea...

42:01.805 --> 42:04.550
there's the matter of my compensation.

42:04.912 --> 42:07.387
I've determined that my services
will require...

42:07.558 --> 42:09.204
the payment of $2,000.

42:13.102 --> 42:15.902
I was thinking more
along the lines of $200.

42:16.102 --> 42:18.201
Fortunately...

42:18.301 --> 42:21.937
my practice allows me
a certain flexibility.

42:23.301 --> 42:26.600
After checking my schedule, I find
I'll be able to make the journey.

42:26.900 --> 42:29.400
As far as the money's concerned,
you've got a deal.

42:33.299 --> 42:34.799
We're off!

42:37.599 --> 42:38.899
Here we go.

42:38.999 --> 42:42.098
Three thousand carefree,
madcap miles to California.

42:42.198 --> 42:44.098
~ <i>California, here we come</i> ~

42:44.198 --> 42:46.697
~ <i>Right back where we started from</i> ~

42:46.797 --> 42:49.797
Thanks to you, Victor, we do not have
a female patient in the back...

42:49.997 --> 42:51.997
thanks to your wonderful Cousin Tessie.

42:52.197 --> 42:55.896
It's not my fault
that she didn't fit in the stretcher.

42:56.196 --> 42:57.596
Doesn't fit in the ambulance.

42:57.796 --> 42:59.896
I got the doc here, didn't I?

43:01.695 --> 43:06.295
Don't ever tell me where you got him.
I don't want to know where you got him.

43:06.595 --> 43:08.794
I was just surprised
that all the animals there were...

43:08.894 --> 43:10.893
I don't want to know
where you got him!

43:12.593 --> 43:14.593
Hey, maybe I could be the patient.

43:14.693 --> 43:17.392
That's a good idea.
Everybody would believe you were sick.

43:17.592 --> 43:20.392
- Don't you believe he's sick?
- Want me to examine him?

43:22.791 --> 43:25.191
Him doesn't like it
when you say bad things about me.

43:25.291 --> 43:26.984
And you know that.

43:27.691 --> 43:30.490
Thanks to you, though,
we don't have a female patient.

43:30.590 --> 43:33.590
And we've got to find a female...

43:35.390 --> 43:36.789
Damn Cannonballers.

43:41.789 --> 43:43.488
I'm so happy you're here.

43:43.688 --> 43:46.483
- Can you help me with Mr...
- Foyt.

43:46.611 --> 43:49.388
- Foyt.
- Sure. That's what I'm here for.

43:49.588 --> 43:52.387
Mr. Foyt. Go around and get in
the emergency entrance.

43:53.787 --> 43:56.987
Come on right here.
There we go. Hit it!

43:57.187 --> 43:59.186
Wait, I'm not...

44:01.786 --> 44:03.686
This is really terrific...

44:03.786 --> 44:06.284
the way you guys go around
helping people.

44:06.484 --> 44:08.384
Next year we're going
for the Nobel Prize.

44:08.584 --> 44:10.484
That's where the big bucks are.

44:13.883 --> 44:16.783
You forgot Mr... Mr...

44:19.182 --> 44:23.182
Well, we got you.
We're batting.500. Nobody's perfect.

44:23.482 --> 44:25.482
Well, I think you have to go back
and pick him up.

44:27.781 --> 44:30.581
We'd really like to,
but we're on kind a tight schedule.

44:30.681 --> 44:32.581
We're on our way to California.

44:32.681 --> 44:35.295
You'd be amazed how many
sick people there are out there.

44:35.637 --> 44:38.980
They need our help.
We could pick him up on the way back.

44:42.314 --> 44:44.679
Victor, can you help me?

44:44.779 --> 44:47.413
No, I can't.
I can't do anything.

44:47.578 --> 44:49.778
But he can.

44:50.078 --> 44:51.445
Who can?

44:51.978 --> 44:52.978
Him.

45:03.136 --> 45:05.175
Excuse me.

45:09.365 --> 45:10.274
Doctor...

45:15.573 --> 45:17.622
My God, the perfect specimen.

45:18.473 --> 45:21.773
J. J., you want me to start
the examination right away?

45:21.973 --> 45:24.772
I'm gonna like this job.
Right here, honey.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.772
No, thank you.
Not right now.

45:35.071 --> 45:37.070
Of course, man.
This took 30 years.

45:45.669 --> 45:47.469
They won't be able to see us...

45:47.569 --> 45:48.969
the son of a guns.

46:10.965 --> 46:12.564
I'm really sorry about that...

46:12.764 --> 46:14.464
little lapse, Officer.

46:14.564 --> 46:16.464
Normally I drive
right around the speed limit.

46:16.930 --> 46:20.763
We all make mistakes, miss, but 160?
That's a little more than a lapse.

46:30.362 --> 46:33.561
What the hell is going on here?
Everybody's driving like maniacs.

46:33.861 --> 46:35.261
I don't know, Officer.

46:35.427 --> 46:37.861
Let me see
your driver's license, please.

46:50.339 --> 46:53.659
What the hell. I can't penalize
nice girls like you...

46:53.859 --> 46:56.457
for a little indiscretion...

46:56.557 --> 46:58.957
with the whole road packed with
speed-crazy lunatics.

47:00.757 --> 47:03.056
Here. You girls have a nice trip.

47:03.256 --> 47:05.256
- Drive carefully and take it easy.
- Thank you.

47:05.593 --> 47:08.556
- Come back and see us next year.
- Bye.

47:10.158 --> 47:12.755
Take care.
Keep it in the road.

47:16.954 --> 47:18.754
I don't know why you're pouting.

47:18.954 --> 47:22.154
I mean, look. We're taking
a nice, leisurely trip to California.

47:22.454 --> 47:24.583
And we're picking up all the bills.
This could be fun.

47:24.683 --> 47:26.753
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

47:26.953 --> 47:28.863
This is not a joke anymore.
I'm being kidnapped.

47:28.963 --> 47:30.952
You can call it kidnapping
if you want to be rude.

47:31.052 --> 47:33.852
Just think. We have
a professional physician on board...

47:34.052 --> 47:35.652
in case somebody gets swamp fever.

47:38.351 --> 47:40.351
You guys are strange.

47:46.050 --> 47:47.550
We got company.

47:47.650 --> 47:49.093
Yeah, I hear.

47:49.391 --> 47:52.448
Okay, Beauty, you lie down
and be a patient for the police.

47:52.548 --> 47:54.548
- Come on. Why?
- Don't!

47:54.648 --> 47:57.048
I'm not gonna help you.
You didn't even help Mr...

48:00.250 --> 48:02.547
Maybe I can help.

48:03.447 --> 48:04.947
Dear God!

48:05.047 --> 48:08.546
It's all right, miss. It doesn't hurt.
Give it to myself all the time.

48:08.846 --> 48:10.746
Yeah. He gives it to himself
all the time.

48:12.795 --> 48:14.045
Show her.

48:17.045 --> 48:18.896
Come on, Doc.
Show her.

48:20.944 --> 48:22.344
Show her.

48:36.042 --> 48:39.342
There. You see?
That didn't hurt.

48:41.341 --> 48:43.141
- J.J.?
- No, thanks.

49:10.036 --> 49:12.236
Hi, guys. What's up?

49:12.436 --> 49:13.636
What's up?

49:13.836 --> 49:17.335
You guys are running at 120.
Your lights are flashing all over.

49:17.535 --> 49:20.035
- We've got a patient in there.
- You were still speeding.

49:21.170 --> 49:23.335
She's very sick.

49:23.534 --> 49:26.034
There's not a hospital within 50 miles.
Where are you headed?

49:26.205 --> 49:28.334
- UCLA.
- UCLA?

49:28.634 --> 49:30.733
- UCLA Medical Center.
- L.A.

49:31.026 --> 49:32.133
California?

49:33.433 --> 49:36.833
This is going to sound like a dumb
question, but if she's that sick...

49:37.033 --> 49:38.216
why didn't you fly her?

49:38.365 --> 49:39.837
Why didn't we fly her?

49:42.952 --> 49:46.230
I'm just the driver.
We have to ask the doc.

49:47.430 --> 49:49.230
That's a good idea.
Why don't we ask the doc?

49:53.229 --> 49:54.629
I'm sorry.

49:56.563 --> 49:59.955
What's going on out here?
What is this crude interruption?

50:04.713 --> 50:07.927
The patient... Why can't she
be flown to California?

50:08.027 --> 50:10.727
Cysts on the walls of her lungs.

50:10.827 --> 50:12.227
Very rare.

50:12.427 --> 50:15.294
You see, airplanes are only
pressurized at 10,000 feet.

50:15.657 --> 50:17.526
Anybody who knows anything
about medicine knows...

50:17.726 --> 50:19.826
that she can't fly,
she has to be driven.

50:20.026 --> 50:22.225
We couldn't even go through Denver,
it's so high.

50:22.425 --> 50:26.025
Tell them to go back
and pick up Mr...

50:28.649 --> 50:31.295
- Is that lady all right?
- She's in great pain.

50:31.724 --> 50:35.223
Causes her to make
certain delirious deliriums.

50:39.023 --> 50:40.523
Sounds like she's on something to me.

50:42.421 --> 50:45.521
Let me explain something to you.
We have to get the senator's wife...

50:45.721 --> 50:48.021
to California in 72 hours.

50:48.121 --> 50:49.720
You understand what I'm saying?

50:51.620 --> 50:53.620
We have to get the senator's wife...

50:53.820 --> 50:56.519
to California in 72 hours.

50:57.519 --> 50:58.619
We're very close.

51:00.019 --> 51:04.018
As long as you're in New Jersey,
I want you fellows to take it easy.

51:04.318 --> 51:06.718
- You got that?
- We sure do.

51:08.718 --> 51:11.217
- Thanks a lot.
- Get this rig out of here.

51:14.317 --> 51:16.517
I'm glad there's no cupcakes
like that in New Jersey.

51:16.717 --> 51:19.016
You haven't met
my brother-in-law Ralph.

51:28.415 --> 51:30.525
I thought that cop was gonna have
a cardiac arrest...

51:30.625 --> 51:32.714
when we said we were going
to California.

51:34.714 --> 51:36.314
Wasn't Beauty terrific?

51:36.414 --> 51:38.212
The lady was splendid.

51:38.412 --> 51:41.712
She should have her picture
on the cover of the AMAJournal.

51:47.311 --> 51:49.611
I'm sure that doctor's
a very sweet man, basically.

51:49.811 --> 51:50.811
Ah, thanks.

51:50.911 --> 51:53.410
But don't you ever tell me
where you found him.

51:53.510 --> 51:54.510
Ever.

51:55.510 --> 51:58.010
It's the Cannonball.
It's the damn Cannonball for sure.

51:58.110 --> 52:00.409
They blasted away
right in front of my eyes.

52:00.609 --> 52:03.309
And they kidnapped a girl
named Pamela Glover...

52:03.409 --> 52:06.209
just like it was the goddamn
Red Brigade or something.

52:07.608 --> 52:10.608
No, I've got them.
This time I've got them.

52:10.908 --> 52:13.507
Ohio? Yes.
Ohio has been notified.

52:14.907 --> 52:17.307
Ohio has been notified.

52:17.407 --> 52:20.107
And Missouri.
And California.

52:20.207 --> 52:23.596
We'll get them, and I'm gonna
be there to handle it.

52:24.322 --> 52:26.306
You can count on it.

52:28.354 --> 52:30.505
I've got two minutes
to catch my flight.

52:30.705 --> 52:31.705
Bye.

52:38.403 --> 52:40.450
- Madam. Madam.
- Madam?

52:40.600 --> 52:42.902
I'm no madam.
I'm a decent, respectable woman.

52:43.102 --> 52:45.202
I don't even own a house.
I live in an apartment.

52:45.402 --> 52:47.602
Now get off my case.
I'm late for my plane.

53:01.900 --> 53:05.518
- After my career in the RAF...
- The what?

53:05.646 --> 53:07.599
The Royal Air Force.

53:07.799 --> 53:11.298
- Do you mind if I have a cigarette?
- Please, go ahead. They're your lungs.

53:11.498 --> 53:14.598
Well, I had a chestful of citations...
medals, that sort of thing...

53:14.798 --> 53:16.678
and then I drifted in playing
a rather popular...

53:16.778 --> 53:18.897
Not that one, darling, please.

53:18.997 --> 53:22.497
We don't want you leaving so shortly
after the trip has begun, do we?

53:22.697 --> 53:24.696
No, of course not.

53:24.796 --> 53:26.996
Then I drifted into playing...

53:27.096 --> 53:29.796
a rather popular character
on a television series.

53:29.896 --> 53:31.694
It's still in syndication, you know.

53:33.188 --> 53:34.510
Puff away.

53:35.994 --> 53:39.293
Thanks a lot, ladies.
But I would take it a little easier.

53:39.393 --> 53:42.793
Some of the officers up the road
might not be as understanding.

53:43.093 --> 53:47.392
Thank you so much, Officer.
We really do appreciate that warning.

53:47.592 --> 53:49.192
And if you're ever in Duluth...

53:49.292 --> 53:51.292
remember to look me up.

53:52.592 --> 53:55.991
I got the number.
You can count on it.

54:07.589 --> 54:08.889
How's the patient?

54:13.389 --> 54:14.588
She's alive.

54:14.788 --> 54:17.488
Looks like she survived the procedure.

54:17.688 --> 54:18.988
What procedure?

54:19.788 --> 54:22.187
If you guys laid a finger on me...

54:27.087 --> 54:28.985
No, I just gave her a little prick.

54:30.485 --> 54:32.385
With this.

54:32.485 --> 54:35.884
Hey, Super Chief, will you lean forward
so I can get the front wheel down?

54:36.084 --> 54:37.984
Stop kidding. I am.

54:54.282 --> 54:58.381
Pull over!
We want to give you our blessings.

54:59.981 --> 55:02.081
There are two priests
in that car over there.

55:05.980 --> 55:07.680
They want us to pull over.

55:09.580 --> 55:11.479
They're two priests
driving a Ferrari.

55:11.679 --> 55:14.379
When's the last time you saw
two priests driving a Ferrari?

55:14.579 --> 55:16.019
Are they taking the bingo money home?

55:16.119 --> 55:18.178
Oh, no, they're doing
the work of the Lord.

55:18.378 --> 55:20.578
In a Ferrari, they can just
do it faster, that's all.

55:21.978 --> 55:23.278
Pull over!

55:24.935 --> 55:26.776
We want to bless you!

55:30.776 --> 55:32.775
One of the priests is black.

55:32.975 --> 55:35.675
- Oh, yeah. They have black priests.
- They do?

55:35.875 --> 55:37.675
Oh, sure.
They have a black cardinal.

55:37.875 --> 55:40.374
Oh, they do want us to pull over.

55:40.574 --> 55:42.774
They want to bless us.
Can we?

55:43.974 --> 55:45.374
Let me get this straight.

55:45.574 --> 55:48.573
You want us to pull over
and be blessed...

55:48.773 --> 55:51.073
by a black priest in a red Ferrari?

55:51.273 --> 55:52.273
Couldn't hurt.

56:03.371 --> 56:06.271
- Nice car, Father.
- Thank you, asshole.

56:07.670 --> 56:09.770
Hello, Father.
Nice-looking car.

56:09.870 --> 56:12.470
That's what everyone says.
He even said it.

56:12.670 --> 56:15.369
I want to thank you
for stopping, son...

56:15.469 --> 56:17.969
'cause we always stop the ambulance...

56:18.169 --> 56:20.269
so we can bless
whoever's in there...

56:20.469 --> 56:23.367
and you paramedics are doing
such a wonderful job.

56:23.667 --> 56:26.667
We're in kind of a hurry,
so just bless it and we can go.

56:29.066 --> 56:31.066
- Oh, I gotta bless her.
- I'm sorry, Father.

56:31.266 --> 56:33.366
She's a Zen Buddhist.

56:33.466 --> 56:35.216
You're not a Zen Buddhist,
so you can't bless her.

56:35.316 --> 56:37.765
We specialize in blessing Zen Buddhists.

56:45.764 --> 56:48.064
On second thought, Father,
you want to bless him?

56:48.164 --> 56:50.270
We need all the help we can get.

56:50.663 --> 56:52.063
Just give him a little shot.

56:53.563 --> 56:55.363
Thank you, Father.

56:56.463 --> 56:58.399
- You're quite welcome.
- You did a good job.

56:58.484 --> 56:59.764
Thank you.

57:02.985 --> 57:04.661
Thank you, Father.

57:05.561 --> 57:08.461
Why don't you take that piece of shit
back to the junkyard?

57:17.660 --> 57:19.758
- We got a...
- Flat.

57:19.958 --> 57:22.358
- And those priests...
- Weren't fathers.

57:22.458 --> 57:24.149
- They were...
- Mothers.

57:24.858 --> 57:26.538
Come here.

57:26.857 --> 57:28.657
Ah, shit!

57:36.864 --> 57:38.848
International film star...

57:39.355 --> 57:40.355
ruthless assassin...

57:40.455 --> 57:43.155
Casanova, poet, philosopher...

57:43.455 --> 57:46.055
You might say a legend in my own time...
in fact, you can.

57:47.954 --> 57:51.254
Not that one, darling. I'm afraid
this car is full of surprises.

57:51.454 --> 57:53.853
This is something I've noticed,
I must say.

57:54.053 --> 57:55.753
How about some champagne,
darling?

57:57.353 --> 57:58.853
<i>Hey, little silver four-wheeler...</i>

57:59.053 --> 58:01.223
<i>that just flew past me</i>
<i>with the good-looking seat cover.</i>

58:01.323 --> 58:05.223
<i>Son, back that thing down.</i>
<i>You got smokies all over my back door.</i>

58:05.952 --> 58:07.651
If you are referring to me...

58:07.751 --> 58:11.751
I request that you speak more clearly
in the queen's English.

58:11.851 --> 58:14.651
That is, if we are going to converse
on this wireless.

58:15.649 --> 58:17.149
Bless your heart.

58:17.349 --> 58:20.149
Cheers.
Down the hatch.

58:50.728 --> 58:52.478
What do you think you're doing?

58:53.068 --> 58:55.044
You can't come in here.
You're a man.

58:55.144 --> 58:58.243
<i>- 7-Eleven. How can I help you?</i>
- Pumps one and two... hit 'em.

58:58.543 --> 59:01.907
<i>What are you, some kind of nut?</i>
<i>You got one unleaded and one premium.</i>

59:03.243 --> 59:04.980
She goes both ways.

59:05.406 --> 59:08.706
The round orange moon pie with
the white hat on... he'll pay for it.

59:08.962 --> 59:11.342
I'm a doctor, and if I may be
permitted the indelicacy...

59:11.540 --> 59:13.577
you seen one,
you've seen 'em all.

59:21.539 --> 59:23.339
Come on.
A thousand miles on one wheel?

59:23.539 --> 59:25.838
We're trying to win a race,
not set a record.

59:43.950 --> 59:46.175
- Victor, what do you got?
- A lot of goodies for you guys...

59:46.282 --> 59:48.373
and a Big Gulp Dr Pepper for me.

59:48.601 --> 59:51.552
~ <i>I'm a pepper, you're a pepper</i>
<i>He's a pepper, she's a pepper</i> ~

59:51.701 --> 59:53.135
~ <i>Wouldn't you like to be</i>
<i>a pepper too</i> ~

59:53.335 --> 59:55.734
- Will you get in here.
- Okay. Here you go.

01:00:04.533 --> 01:00:05.833
Officer!

01:00:10.169 --> 01:00:12.132
Do you take your law and order
in this town seriously?

01:00:12.345 --> 01:00:13.540
Are you kidding?

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:20.380
Excuse me for asking.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.756
Greek! But...

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.466
Would you shut up a minute
and listen to me?

01:00:39.627 --> 01:00:41.927
Oh, by the way, Greek.

01:00:42.298 --> 01:00:45.626
What's the odds on the japanese team
not finishing?

01:00:45.839 --> 01:00:48.720
There's gonna be a red Ferrari come
flying through here in a few seconds...

01:00:48.869 --> 01:00:51.130
and the two men driving
are responsible for the victim...

01:00:51.344 --> 01:00:52.425
lying back here
in this ambulance.

01:00:53.093 --> 01:00:55.717
- Victim?
- A flasher victim.

01:00:56.912 --> 01:00:58.685
- You want to know the worst part?
- What's that?

01:00:58.824 --> 01:01:01.024
- They're dressed as priests.
- Go on.

01:01:01.307 --> 01:01:04.315
I guess they think it's a little
kinkier, you know, dressed as priests.

01:01:04.485 --> 01:01:07.110
Goddamn, that's sick.
I'll handle this.

01:01:07.387 --> 01:01:10.160
Oh... one more thing.
I think they're armed.

01:01:11.522 --> 01:01:15.536
Damn, I hope so.
It'll give me an excuse.

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.820
Flashers!

01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:28.319
Bye-bye!

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:30.519
J. J., you son of a...

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:33.418
Out of the car,
both of you. Now!

01:01:37.518 --> 01:01:38.918
All right, hit it.

01:01:39.518 --> 01:01:40.917
- Hit it?
- Hit it?

01:01:47.616 --> 01:01:49.756
Freeze, or name your beneficiary.

01:01:49.969 --> 01:01:51.616
Beneficiary?

01:01:51.816 --> 01:01:53.816
Officer, I sincerely hope...

01:01:53.916 --> 01:01:55.686
- you're not a Catholic.
- Pay no attention to him.

01:01:55.786 --> 01:01:58.204
He's been locked up for six years
in that monastery...

01:01:58.315 --> 01:01:59.815
and he don't know what he's doing.

01:01:59.915 --> 01:02:01.955
I don't think both of his paddles
are in the water.

01:02:02.113 --> 01:02:04.043
Six years is gonna seem like
a summer vacation...

01:02:04.143 --> 01:02:06.183
when the state of Missouri
gets through with you.

01:02:06.503 --> 01:02:09.938
You, shorty.
Where'd you get all that jewelry?

01:02:11.012 --> 01:02:14.724
- Why'd he call me shorty?
- 'Cause you're small. Small.

01:02:15.312 --> 01:02:16.711
S-M-ALL.

01:02:17.911 --> 01:02:20.211
<i>I suggest you take</i>
<i>another route, good buddy.</i>

01:02:20.311 --> 01:02:22.511
<i>The smokies are getting traffic</i>
<i>all tied up on 40...</i>

01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:24.310
<i>Looking for them Cannonballers.</i>

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:26.110
<i>That's a big ten-four.</i>

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.710
- Hey, J.J.
- Yeah?

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.574
There's a lot of talk on the CB
about the roadblock ahead.

01:02:30.788 --> 01:02:31.909
What do you think?

01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:33.540
I think we're in deep you-know-what.

01:02:34.386 --> 01:02:35.759
The transmission is slipping.

01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:39.208
And we lost a lot of time
because of your two phony priests.

01:02:39.508 --> 01:02:41.299
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:02:42.472 --> 01:02:44.507
Listen, if the transmission
does hold together...

01:02:44.707 --> 01:02:47.557
you think we're gonna be able to bluff
our way through the roadblock ahead?

01:02:47.657 --> 01:02:48.851
I don't know.

01:02:49.207 --> 01:02:51.347
Give me a minute
to gather my thoughts.

01:02:58.904 --> 01:03:01.822
I gathered my thoughts.
Hey, Lowboy!

01:03:02.057 --> 01:03:03.704
Look in your rearview mirror.

01:03:03.955 --> 01:03:05.553
You see this ambulance back here?

01:03:05.812 --> 01:03:07.503
We need a piggyback ride.

01:03:09.403 --> 01:03:12.020
This one can go by.
There's no problem here.

01:03:12.303 --> 01:03:15.348
Let's just have this one and...

01:03:15.602 --> 01:03:17.402
that one.

01:03:20.901 --> 01:03:23.476
Yeah, that one's okay.
Let it go.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.300
Excuse me, but you look very familiar.
Do I know you?

01:03:31.498 --> 01:03:33.650
Yes, that's quite possible.
Is this going to take long?

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:36.299
You see, we're on our honeymoon,
and she can't wait.

01:03:36.499 --> 01:03:38.099
Oh, thank God.
Normal people!

01:03:38.199 --> 01:03:40.079
No, you see, we were just
looking for Cannon...

01:03:40.199 --> 01:03:42.498
It's not important.
Just move along, if you would.

01:03:42.741 --> 01:03:45.298
- What is this, anyway?
- It's a stakeout.

01:03:45.398 --> 01:03:46.943
Oh. Bon appetit.

01:03:48.597 --> 01:03:49.997
English humor.

01:03:51.397 --> 01:03:53.197
Come on, guys,
keep moving, will you, please?

01:03:56.895 --> 01:03:58.378
Let's see...

01:04:01.195 --> 01:04:03.797
Quiet, Victor.
You're gonna blow our cover.

01:04:03.904 --> 01:04:06.494
J. J., this is not
a nine-to-five job.

01:04:06.794 --> 01:04:08.768
I wish him were here.

01:04:08.894 --> 01:04:09.894
Hi.

01:04:10.693 --> 01:04:11.893
Hello.

01:04:16.256 --> 01:04:17.392
You look tired.

01:04:17.707 --> 01:04:19.925
More frustrated than tired.

01:04:20.075 --> 01:04:22.230
Think you're gonna win
this crazy race?

01:04:23.168 --> 01:04:24.384
Damn right I am.

01:04:25.391 --> 01:04:29.191
I'm sitting here having a conversation
with somebody who kidnapped me.

01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:33.390
Who can blame anybody
for kidnapping you?

01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:36.490
You gave me laughing gas.

01:04:36.843 --> 01:04:39.915
Well, you have
an awful beautiful laugh.

01:04:40.427 --> 01:04:42.689
You made me forget my favorite skirt
back at the motel.

01:04:42.889 --> 01:04:45.846
Doesn't matter.
You look terrific without it.

01:04:54.286 --> 01:04:55.786
What'd you expect, anyway?

01:04:58.785 --> 01:05:01.484
- A gang bang or something like that.
- A gang bang?

01:05:02.444 --> 01:05:04.085
We're racers, not rapists.

01:05:05.784 --> 01:05:08.484
- Why?
- Why what?

01:05:10.184 --> 01:05:13.583
Why all this speed and trouble
and risk and...

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.202
I mean, what for?

01:05:15.683 --> 01:05:16.994
For the hell of it.

01:05:19.746 --> 01:05:21.163
Didn't you ever do anything
just for the hell of it?

01:05:21.782 --> 01:05:23.282
I guess so.

01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:26.146
My father used to work
in the coal mines.

01:05:28.981 --> 01:05:30.281
Forty-three years.

01:05:32.581 --> 01:05:34.338
He was gonna retire.

01:05:35.597 --> 01:05:36.834
Buy a houseboat.

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.416
Move down to Florida.

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:44.216
Fish on the back of the boat
and tell my mom lies.

01:05:47.379 --> 01:05:49.577
He died two days
before he was gonna retire.

01:05:52.131 --> 01:05:53.624
I guess you just never know.

01:05:54.577 --> 01:05:55.577
Yeah.

01:05:57.379 --> 01:05:59.150
I made up my mind right then.

01:05:59.876 --> 01:06:01.560
I was gonna go for it...

01:06:02.176 --> 01:06:03.675
I mean, everything I wanted...

01:06:04.035 --> 01:06:06.040
I was gonna go for it
right then...

01:06:07.075 --> 01:06:09.283
because you never know when
something's gonna happen to you.

01:06:10.874 --> 01:06:12.633
Like talking to you, you know?

01:06:14.174 --> 01:06:15.875
I mean, it's really nice.

01:06:19.716 --> 01:06:22.373
Excuse me.
Where are you guys going?

01:06:22.574 --> 01:06:26.172
We're just out
looking for a pack of cigarettes.

01:06:26.472 --> 01:06:28.272
With North Carolina plates...

01:06:28.372 --> 01:06:30.052
you're driving
to Missouri for cigarettes?

01:06:32.217 --> 01:06:33.371
How about a beer?

01:06:33.625 --> 01:06:36.171
How about the fact
that your paint job is coming off?

01:06:36.569 --> 01:06:39.970
You want to take these guys away?
The good guys strike back!

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:44.015
What is that? Five, eight, three...
Five, eight, three, six...

01:06:46.568 --> 01:06:47.868
Hold on. Hold on.

01:06:47.968 --> 01:06:50.068
Let it go. Come on.

01:06:50.268 --> 01:06:52.267
Come on, guys, keep moving,
will you please?

01:06:57.067 --> 01:06:59.439
Howdy, sir.
What seems to be the problem?

01:06:59.566 --> 01:07:01.826
You guys didn't really think
you'd get away with this, did you?

01:07:01.926 --> 01:07:03.286
We're gonna get
the whole lot of you now.

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:06.265
Not here, you won't. The word is out
about your little roadblock.

01:07:06.465 --> 01:07:08.865
They're talking about it
all up and down the "superslab."

01:07:09.665 --> 01:07:12.265
Get these traitors out of here,
will you?

01:07:12.965 --> 01:07:14.764
Think you're so big.

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:19.064
Do some of you people want to come over
and push this thing out of the way?

01:07:19.365 --> 01:07:21.263
Come on.
I'll put it in neutral.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:25.263
Who did that?
Make it stop!

01:07:41.211 --> 01:07:43.159
Thanks a lot!
Keep on truckin'!

01:07:57.057 --> 01:08:00.006
Hey, George, you remember the good old
days before they got radar in?

01:08:00.157 --> 01:08:01.657
We used to chase speeders?

01:08:01.757 --> 01:08:03.456
Yeah. This is really boring.

01:08:23.238 --> 01:08:24.533
Bye-bye!

01:08:24.647 --> 01:08:26.653
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know...

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.953
but whatever the hell it was,
it was doing 125.

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:46.759
That's the first time
we took an order by phone.

01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:48.198
It was hard to understand you.

01:08:48.299 --> 01:08:51.357
When I called you,
I was doing 140 miles an hour.

01:08:51.549 --> 01:08:53.648
That was six lamb burgers,
four shish kebabs...

01:08:53.848 --> 01:08:55.848
a side order of couscous...

01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:58.048
and two milk.

01:08:58.247 --> 01:08:59.947
No! How much?

01:09:00.046 --> 01:09:01.448
Six seventy-five.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.051
Here, my desert blossom.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:05.846
Keep the change.

01:09:06.046 --> 01:09:08.446
Have you ever considered
joining a harem?

01:09:10.018 --> 01:09:12.946
I shall return for you
after the race.

01:09:21.544 --> 01:09:22.718
Get a physical.

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.444
I shall return, my little fig.
I love you!

01:09:35.143 --> 01:09:38.078
I don't know
how to ask you this, but...

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.401
isn't it a little strange
having that guy...

01:09:40.553 --> 01:09:42.939
running around inside your head?

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.640
He's not in here.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.785
He's out there somewhere,
helping people.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.689
He's always helping people.
He'd help you.

01:09:51.881 --> 01:09:53.139
He would?

01:09:53.238 --> 01:09:54.783
He likes you.

01:09:57.538 --> 01:09:58.838
How did he find you?

01:09:59.038 --> 01:10:01.038
I mean, how did you two
get together?

01:10:01.138 --> 01:10:03.438
Well, when I was real young...

01:10:03.637 --> 01:10:05.937
I didn't have any friends
like I do now.

01:10:06.237 --> 01:10:07.637
Like J.J.

01:10:08.937 --> 01:10:10.037
Like J.J.

01:10:13.024 --> 01:10:14.836
One day I was in the schoolyard...

01:10:15.036 --> 01:10:17.568
and nine guys were beating me up
pretty good.

01:10:18.135 --> 01:10:19.435
There he was.

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:24.373
- Captain Chaos?
- Yeah. Out of the blue!

01:10:24.501 --> 01:10:28.619
Pow! Slam! Bam! Boff!

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:31.634
I sure was grateful.

01:10:31.834 --> 01:10:33.032
That's great!

01:10:33.232 --> 01:10:35.360
Nobody bothered me at school
after that.

01:10:36.064 --> 01:10:37.532
I wish I had a friend
like that.

01:10:37.728 --> 01:10:40.431
Well, first you need a mask
and a cape.

01:10:41.227 --> 01:10:43.331
I think I'd like mine
to be pink.

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:45.231
Almost everything I wear
is pink.

01:10:45.431 --> 01:10:46.746
Everything?

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:49.056
Even...

01:10:49.249 --> 01:10:50.830
I don't wear any.

01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:52.363
You don't?

01:10:53.793 --> 01:10:54.929
Wow.

01:10:58.729 --> 01:11:00.428
I'd like to be your friend...

01:11:00.628 --> 01:11:02.528
'cause I like you.

01:11:03.528 --> 01:11:05.441
I like you too, Beauty.

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:07.128
Thank you.

01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:22.625
New Mexico.

01:11:33.123 --> 01:11:35.423
Texas?
Stupid!

01:12:05.361 --> 01:12:07.318
I'll take care of this one.

01:12:20.116 --> 01:12:21.516
Hello, hot pants.

01:12:21.616 --> 01:12:23.516
I don't suppose
you have a driver's license...

01:12:23.616 --> 01:12:25.827
tucked down in there somewhere,
do you?

01:12:25.998 --> 01:12:27.534
Yes, Officer.

01:12:36.313 --> 01:12:38.913
That policeman seems to want us
to stop, darling.

01:12:39.213 --> 01:12:42.112
Yes. He must be rather upset
with our rapid rate.

01:12:42.312 --> 01:12:44.992
Funny. They don't have any sense
of humor about that sort of thing.

01:12:45.212 --> 01:12:46.611
Aren't you going to pull over?

01:12:46.711 --> 01:12:48.211
I'd rather not.

01:12:48.311 --> 01:12:51.511
Can be such a bore,
talking to those chaps.

01:12:51.711 --> 01:12:53.910
Tell you what.
We'll just slip away.

01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:57.010
- Hit that button, will you?
- Like in your movies!

01:13:02.692 --> 01:13:05.309
And now a little oil,
right, darling?

01:13:17.007 --> 01:13:19.707
Well, well. We are full of tricks,
aren't we?

01:13:19.907 --> 01:13:22.007
It's all part of my business,
really.

01:13:22.205 --> 01:13:25.925
I've been meaning to ask you, darling.
What movie... Wait a minute.

01:13:26.181 --> 01:13:28.165
- Can you see where you're going?
- Perfectly.

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:30.904
This is ridiculous.

01:13:37.903 --> 01:13:39.453
It's good sport, isn't it?

01:13:39.553 --> 01:13:41.553
Would you mind rolling
your window down, old girl?

01:13:41.703 --> 01:13:43.902
We're getting done up
like a couple of kippers here.

01:13:44.102 --> 01:13:46.102
Next time, I bring my mask.

01:13:46.202 --> 01:13:47.602
A foggy day in London town.

01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:01.000
<i>You are about to witness</i>
<i>the ravishment...</i>

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.600
<i>of a woman who has been abducted.</i>

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:08.799
<i>A woman whose initial fear</i>
<i>has mellowed into curious expectation.</i>

01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:12.798
<i>In the morning, she will be set free,</i>
<i>unaware of anything...</i>

01:14:12.898 --> 01:14:16.598
<i>except that she has been loved</i>
<i>as never before.</i>

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:28.695
<i>Oh, yes, there!</i>

01:14:28.795 --> 01:14:29.795
<i>Yes!</i>

01:14:42.593 --> 01:14:45.593
I've never seen a damn Rolls Royce
that'd do 140 miles an hour.

01:14:45.793 --> 01:14:47.392
What do you fellas got
in that thing?

01:14:47.492 --> 01:14:49.592
- Stock.
- Sign here.

01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:51.792
I guess you must have misconstrued
my remark...

01:14:51.992 --> 01:14:54.791
about my mother planning to purchase
Southern California...

01:14:54.891 --> 01:14:57.853
as an attempt to influence
your giving me a ticket, Officer.

01:14:58.386 --> 01:15:01.390
I am sure that she will still
consider keeping you all on...

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:03.890
as a member of the Highway Patrol,
regardless...

01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:05.690
of how shabbily
you treated her son.

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:08.489
You might want to tell that
to the judge, sir.

01:15:20.087 --> 01:15:22.786
This is for you and the judge!

01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:24.886
Goddamn camel jockey.

01:15:34.185 --> 01:15:37.584
Oh, shit.
We got a smokey on our tail.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:39.284
Watch this.

01:15:42.184 --> 01:15:43.384
- Officer.
- Pull it over.

01:15:43.484 --> 01:15:45.983
We got no brakes!
No brakes!

01:15:46.283 --> 01:15:48.183
Help us!
Yes, thank you!

01:15:48.283 --> 01:15:50.183
Damn "no brake" gag
works every time.

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:56.182
Oh, no!
We really don't have any brakes!

01:15:56.482 --> 01:15:58.481
- Quit kidding, will you?
- Hang on!

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.880
Evel Knievel...

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:12.378
you've got yourself
some competition.

01:17:20.568 --> 01:17:22.177
Secret weapon.

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:42.965
Ready, fire!

01:17:58.462 --> 01:17:59.762
How long we been here?

01:18:01.062 --> 01:18:03.362
Twenty minutes.
We could have been there by now.

01:18:03.650 --> 01:18:05.760
We're gonna be open
in five minutes, Father.

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:17.517
Father Putz.

01:18:18.797 --> 01:18:20.589
Albert Schweitzer!

01:18:20.908 --> 01:18:24.158
I want to thank you for being
so sweet and so nice...

01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:28.312
and telling those people all about us
back in Missouri...

01:18:28.504 --> 01:18:31.957
that we were both flashers
and sex maniacs.

01:18:34.797 --> 01:18:37.156
Well, I just
wanted to return the favor...

01:18:37.356 --> 01:18:40.056
that you and the chocolate monk
did for us back in Ohio.

01:18:41.155 --> 01:18:43.155
"The chocolate monk"?

01:18:46.339 --> 01:18:48.792
He could say that.

01:18:48.899 --> 01:18:53.187
He could say it 'cause he's riding
around with the Goodyear blimp.

01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:54.404
"The Goodyear blimp"?

01:18:54.504 --> 01:18:56.653
- He can say that.
- Yeah, I can say that.

01:18:56.853 --> 01:18:59.353
Because if I had the time...

01:18:59.453 --> 01:19:03.051
I would take those rosary beads
and stuff'em up your nose.

01:19:03.193 --> 01:19:04.551
- These rosary beads?
- Yeah.

01:19:04.651 --> 01:19:06.606
My rosary beads?
You're gonna shove 'em up this nose?

01:19:06.862 --> 01:19:08.932
Up that nose, yeah.

01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:12.850
- He can do that.
- He can do that.

01:19:13.796 --> 01:19:16.050
- You take a little advice?
- Sure.

01:19:17.549 --> 01:19:19.149
Bring friends.

01:19:24.655 --> 01:19:26.063
A lot of them.

01:19:31.716 --> 01:19:32.947
He wants me to bring...

01:19:35.047 --> 01:19:36.147
Blimp?

01:19:50.445 --> 01:19:53.544
Ah. The bride and groom
Cannonballer.

01:19:53.844 --> 01:19:55.844
I told you this honeymoon scheme
would work.

01:19:56.044 --> 01:19:58.194
Good. Now you wear the wig,
sweetheart.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:00.142
- It's hot.
- Oh, I don't know.

01:20:00.342 --> 01:20:02.942
When I was in Egypt making
The Fly Who Bugged Me...

01:20:03.142 --> 01:20:06.661
it was at least 180 in the shade...
not that there was much shade.

01:20:06.841 --> 01:20:08.841
If CBS would have
had their cameras there...

01:20:09.041 --> 01:20:10.841
we'd have made Sports Spectacular
for sure.

01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:12.611
We just zoomed right out
over that train.

01:20:12.711 --> 01:20:14.240
What, do you want
to try it again?

01:20:35.974 --> 01:20:37.237
All right!

01:20:38.837 --> 01:20:42.054
Don't you look precious,
all dressed up like that.

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:45.318
And wearing a wig too.
Ain't he cute?

01:20:45.553 --> 01:20:47.302
Those guys scare me.

01:20:47.736 --> 01:20:50.535
You just stay close to Moore.
There won't be any trouble.

01:20:51.535 --> 01:20:53.655
He looks like Gregory Peck
in that blue flannel suit.

01:20:58.033 --> 01:20:59.733
This is my friend Shakey.

01:20:59.933 --> 01:21:01.433
Allow me to present myself.

01:21:01.633 --> 01:21:03.753
I'm on Wall Street.
Maybe we can have lunch sometime.

01:21:04.432 --> 01:21:06.632
We don't ride on Wall Street.

01:21:06.832 --> 01:21:09.132
Nah, we don't ride on Wall Street.

01:21:09.232 --> 01:21:12.131
- Why don't we go over and help 'em out?
- What do you mean "we"?

01:21:12.231 --> 01:21:16.031
If we do, then that road opens up
and you're long gone.

01:21:16.331 --> 01:21:18.080
Now, why don't you?

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.430
You're the Good Samaritan.

01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:23.230
Besides, I'm wearing these.

01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:26.450
Maybe you would like
to complete your ensemble.

01:21:26.578 --> 01:21:28.269
Oh, no. There's something else
of yours that I want.

01:21:28.369 --> 01:21:29.829
Oh, really? What's that?

01:21:29.929 --> 01:21:31.228
Your ass!

01:21:41.427 --> 01:21:42.727
Oh, shit.

01:21:43.927 --> 01:21:45.826
Well, shall we join the fracas?

01:22:04.723 --> 01:22:06.123
Step back, my dear.

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:09.172
I must warn you,
I'm Roger Moore.

01:22:09.272 --> 01:22:11.722
- Who?
- Roger Moore.

01:22:15.421 --> 01:22:17.021
We'll run in there.

01:22:19.121 --> 01:22:20.621
Knock 'em flat out.

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:23.720
- Then we go. We could still win it.
- We can do that.

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:25.620
- We can do that. Yeah.
- We can do that.

01:22:30.019 --> 01:22:32.719
You'll be sorry!
Let me down!

01:22:35.718 --> 01:22:37.118
Take that!

01:22:49.215 --> 01:22:51.015
You're so macho.

01:22:51.115 --> 01:22:52.515
Watch this.

01:23:03.114 --> 01:23:04.513
Need some help, Father?

01:23:08.613 --> 01:23:09.913
Give me somebody!

01:23:11.012 --> 01:23:12.912
What, are you crazy, Greek?

01:23:13.112 --> 01:23:16.112
How could you possibly change odds
in the middle of things?

01:23:18.112 --> 01:23:21.974
Hold it. You wouldn't last five minutes
in the New York subway.

01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:25.110
That's the way it's done.

01:23:35.009 --> 01:23:38.443
- Is that good to drink?
- I don't know. I never tried it.

01:23:50.406 --> 01:23:52.606
Hold it, hold it.
You wanna try this side?

01:23:52.805 --> 01:23:53.805
Yeah.

01:23:57.153 --> 01:23:59.005
Need some help?

01:23:59.105 --> 01:24:00.804
- Will you get out of here?
- Right!

01:24:10.703 --> 01:24:12.172
Thanks, Shakey.
Excuse me.

01:24:12.303 --> 01:24:14.003
Get this guy, Shakey!

01:24:17.002 --> 01:24:18.802
Excuse me, Father,
but the road's open.

01:24:18.935 --> 01:24:20.402
Oh, thanks.

01:24:22.701 --> 01:24:24.101
The road's open!

01:24:27.901 --> 01:24:28.901
Bye.

01:24:37.099 --> 01:24:38.599
Let's go! Hit it!

01:25:35.890 --> 01:25:37.845
- Come on, come on! Faster, faster!
- I'm trying.

01:25:37.945 --> 01:25:40.788
- Come on, faster!
- Drive it like Captain Chaos would.

01:25:41.088 --> 01:25:42.238
I'll try.

01:25:42.338 --> 01:25:43.953
What'd you take off
that goddamn mask for?

01:25:44.053 --> 01:25:45.948
I didn't take off the mask.
He took off the mask.

01:25:57.786 --> 01:25:59.636
- We need him, Victor!
- I don't know where he is.

01:25:59.736 --> 01:26:02.385
Very interesting fellow.
I'd like to probe his case.

01:26:02.685 --> 01:26:05.135
I don't believe this shit.
We don't want him around, he's around.

01:26:05.235 --> 01:26:07.484
When we want him, he's not around.
I'm gonna get a beer.

01:26:41.779 --> 01:26:43.778
It's only ten blocks to the finish.

01:26:43.978 --> 01:26:47.678
I feel very confident
that we will be triumphant.

01:27:03.876 --> 01:27:06.375
- What the hell was that?
- A Lamborghini.

01:27:06.475 --> 01:27:09.075
- She in the race?
- Catch it!

01:27:13.674 --> 01:27:15.874
Will you go faster!
Come on!

01:27:17.274 --> 01:27:20.873
I've seen every single one of your
movies at least three or four times.

01:27:21.173 --> 01:27:22.473
Four times?

01:27:22.673 --> 01:27:26.272
- I think we've got it goin', baby.
- Yeah, we're looking good.

01:27:26.372 --> 01:27:28.472
Greek's gonna pay us money!

01:27:28.572 --> 01:27:30.572
Gosh! Wait'll I tell my friends...

01:27:30.672 --> 01:27:34.270
I was sitting
next to George Hamilton!

01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:36.770
George Hamilton?

01:27:41.569 --> 01:27:42.969
- We got 'em!
- We got 'em!

01:27:49.968 --> 01:27:51.568
Look out!

01:27:52.868 --> 01:27:54.467
It's a foot race!

01:27:54.667 --> 01:27:56.482
- I've got the card...
- No, give me that, Doc.

01:27:56.582 --> 01:27:58.367
Come on!
It's a foot race!

01:27:58.567 --> 01:28:00.567
Have no fear!
Chaos is here!

01:28:02.966 --> 01:28:05.266
Take it and win, Captain!

01:28:10.165 --> 01:28:11.765
Anyone need medical attention?

01:28:13.265 --> 01:28:15.364
Go! Go, Chaos!

01:28:17.864 --> 01:28:18.792
We're gonna win!

01:28:18.942 --> 01:28:21.764
It's not a sporting way to win.
What do you say, Father?

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:24.124
No, it's not a sporting way,
it's a shitty way to win.

01:28:26.686 --> 01:28:29.661
We won!
We're gonna win!

01:28:30.261 --> 01:28:33.561
Help! Help! Somebody save my baby!
He's drowning!

01:28:37.865 --> 01:28:40.160
No problem, fair lady.
I will save your baby.

01:28:40.318 --> 01:28:42.217
Have no fear!

01:28:49.359 --> 01:28:51.358
Oh, my baby, my baby.

01:28:51.604 --> 01:28:54.158
Thank you.
You're such a brave man.

01:28:54.249 --> 01:28:56.105
You don't know
what this means to me.

01:28:56.212 --> 01:28:59.457
Oh, my baby, I love you.

01:28:59.796 --> 01:29:03.057
J. J., I saved that woman's dog.

01:29:04.852 --> 01:29:07.348
Victor, we could have won
that race.

01:29:07.656 --> 01:29:09.456
You understand what I'm telling you?
We could have won!

01:29:09.556 --> 01:29:10.556
You understand that?

01:29:10.656 --> 01:29:12.746
You had to go
pull that stupid stunt.

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.260
He's right, Victor.

01:29:14.623 --> 01:29:16.855
We are sick of Captain Chaos.

01:29:17.055 --> 01:29:19.754
We are so sick of Captain Chaos
we could throw up.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:21.301
So you know what, Victor?

01:29:21.504 --> 01:29:23.354
There's not gonna be any more
Captain Chaos.

01:29:23.554 --> 01:29:26.652
No more!
You see what I'm telling you?

01:29:28.752 --> 01:29:30.952
No more Captain Chaos!

01:29:31.152 --> 01:29:32.452
Now, what do you think of that?

01:29:37.024 --> 01:29:39.883
I don't care, because...

01:29:41.050 --> 01:29:43.350
I've always wanted to be...

01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:45.250
Captain USA!

01:29:50.049 --> 01:29:53.149
It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

01:30:05.847 --> 01:30:08.641
- Who won the race?
- What do you get for last?

01:30:14.046 --> 01:30:18.045
How do you all feel, now that
you have raped the American highways?

01:30:18.345 --> 01:30:19.845
- Beautiful. Wonderful.
- Great.

01:30:20.045 --> 01:30:22.245
Old chap, I suggest
you get a grip on yourself...

01:30:22.445 --> 01:30:24.129
or better, on one of these.

01:30:24.855 --> 01:30:26.143
I'll take anything.

01:30:26.243 --> 01:30:29.548
And feel free to use the lighter
in my car, Mr...

01:30:30.042 --> 01:30:31.340
Foyt.

01:30:33.642 --> 01:30:36.242
You wait till he touches
that lighter.

01:30:42.647 --> 01:30:43.940
Ain't nothin' happening.

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.044
That's funny.

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.840
Excuse me.

01:30:53.339 --> 01:30:56.578
Mr. Foyt,
how did you light that?

01:30:57.346 --> 01:30:59.138
Well, with the lighter,
of course.

01:31:01.738 --> 01:31:03.038
That's odd.

01:31:13.389 --> 01:31:16.136
I've got a feeling
next year we'll do this again.

01:31:20.813 --> 01:31:22.634
J. J., didn't we do good?

01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.700
- Stop it.
- Ready?

01:32:02.755 --> 01:32:05.699
- Stop it!
- Okay. Okay.

01:32:09.006 --> 01:32:10.748
Wait a minute. I got something.

01:32:10.848 --> 01:32:12.698
No, this will help.

01:32:12.898 --> 01:32:16.879
I'm not gonna hit you.

01:32:17.096 --> 01:32:18.796
Listen to me. I swear to God.

01:32:18.896 --> 01:32:21.296
I'm not gonna hit you. Watch. Watch.

01:32:24.095 --> 01:32:26.372
Okay, I'm ready now.

01:32:26.695 --> 01:32:28.079
Here we go.

01:32:34.694 --> 01:32:36.122
Look at that shit.

01:32:38.493 --> 01:32:41.093
I'm ready, I'm ready.
I swear to God, I'm ready.

01:32:41.328 --> 01:32:42.458
We're off.

01:32:47.792 --> 01:32:49.292
Where's he gonna sit?

01:32:55.391 --> 01:32:58.053
I warned you not to interfere
in my affairs.

01:32:58.224 --> 01:33:01.189
Steven, put away. Seymour. Excuse me.

01:33:01.531 --> 01:33:03.890
That's all right.
I'll answer to anything.

01:33:04.090 --> 01:33:06.989
You see, even in the deepest
family relations...

01:33:09.389 --> 01:33:11.289
My business is not worth a...

01:33:13.862 --> 01:33:15.087
Thank you, Victor.

01:33:16.687 --> 01:33:18.687
As you probably know, we're...

01:33:18.887 --> 01:33:20.386
we're the favorites to...

01:33:20.586 --> 01:33:22.286
be the winning racers tomorrow...

01:33:22.486 --> 01:33:23.686
in the Cannonball...

01:33:23.786 --> 01:33:27.174
Race, which is gonna be poured...

01:33:27.985 --> 01:33:29.185
Good evening, ladies.

01:33:29.285 --> 01:33:30.385
- Evening.
- Hello.

01:33:30.485 --> 01:33:33.190
My name is J.J. McClure,
and this is my...

01:33:36.084 --> 01:33:37.984
Next year we're going for the...

01:33:38.184 --> 01:33:39.184
Yes?

01:33:46.683 --> 01:33:48.382
Perfect. Perfect.

01:33:50.982 --> 01:33:52.682
Better than...

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.081
We have to get this woman...

01:33:55.281 --> 01:33:56.781
the senator's wife...

01:33:56.981 --> 01:33:58.481
to Philadelphia by...

01:33:58.681 --> 01:34:00.519
Make that California, will you?

01:34:02.781 --> 01:34:03.980
We're very close.

01:34:13.278 --> 01:34:15.378
Because if I had enough time...

01:34:15.578 --> 01:34:16.853
I would take those rosary bleeds...

01:34:16.953 --> 01:34:19.058
and stuff'em up your nose.

01:34:19.277 --> 01:34:21.777
- These bleeds?
- Those bleeds, yeah.

01:34:21.977 --> 01:34:23.476
You're gonna take these...

01:34:23.676 --> 01:34:26.476
- and shove 'em up my nose?
- I'd take these bleeds here...

01:34:27.848 --> 01:34:29.076
I don't care...

01:34:33.437 --> 01:34:35.677
- I don't care...
- Stop laughing!

01:34:36.787 --> 01:34:38.451
I don't care, because...

01:34:39.974 --> 01:34:41.501
You're gonna get slapped.

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.443
I always wanted to be...

01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:45.171
Captain America!

01:34:49.273 --> 01:34:50.673
It's a living.

01:34:52.372 --> 01:34:54.372
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:34:54.572 --> 01:34:58.871
He laughed... He laughed first.

01:34:59.071 --> 01:35:00.971
Mr. Martin laughed first.

01:35:03.971 --> 01:35:05.694
Why were you laughing?

01:35:05.871 --> 01:35:08.062
He laughed and you hit me!

01:35:09.255 --> 01:35:10.655
Cut it.
