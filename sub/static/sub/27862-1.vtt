WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
I been doing just fine up until now.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
I just don’t know what
I’ve gotten myself into.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
This could be maybe the
worst thing that I ever did.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Well, maybe not the worst thing.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
There was that time when I… nevermind.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
All I’m sayin’ is, I just
never saw this comin’.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
After all, 20 years is a long time not to

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
hear from a body, you know what I mean.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Well I’m not gonna answer it.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Holy crap! Another damn telemarketer,
right Elvis?

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Do you smell that?

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh shit I’m out.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
See, not so hard now, is it? Come here.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Let’s see. Oh that seems
to be healing nicely.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Oh… k then. Alright!

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Everybody ready? We got
a long drive to Umatilla.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Sam?

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
You’re gonna be fine.
Florida’s a nice place.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
And I think you’re going to
enjoy living with your aunt.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
You know there's nothing like family.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Hey dirtbag!

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Don’t forget this.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Making progress Elvis!

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Beautiful isn’t it?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I think I’m gonna puke.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Sweetie, please stop that.
And aren’t you gonna eat your sandwich?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
I’m not hungry and don’t call me that.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Just try a few bites.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I don’t feel good.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
You’ve had a rough year.
Different foster homes and all.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Change is scary, it would
make anyone feel queasy.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Rebecca I really don’t feel good.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Just give it some time, you’ll see.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
I’m gonna puke.
What?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I’m definitely gonna puke.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
Oh God!

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Please stop that.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
So we have successfully

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
moved this pile of

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
highly important stuff from

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
that room into here.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Looks much better, don’tcha think Elvis?

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Should make Miss Uptight
Smarty Pants happy.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Don’t judge me.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
OK, let’s do this.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
The brochure you gave me said

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
‘beautiful beaches, warm
sand and Disney World!'

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Hush.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
It’s open!

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I said it’s open!

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Oh for Christ’s sake!

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I SAID it’s open!

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Oh. It’s you.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Of course it’s me. We’ve had
this scheduled for weeks.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah but you didn’t say exactly what time.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
You shoulda called first.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I did call!

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I called 10 times today and I called you

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
from the car parked in front of your house

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
not two minutes ago. We both
know that you didn't answer.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Well still. It ain’t polite
to just drop in on folks.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I though that you were going to…
WHAT?

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Mrs. Batinger we specifically spoke—
Olina.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Yes of course, I’m sorry. Olina.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
We specifically spoke about
the need for organization.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Yes you are correct we
did speak about that.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Where do I put this?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Samantha-

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Sam, my name is Sam.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Yes I’m so sorry. I forgot.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Sam, Olina.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
This is your niece Sam.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Sam, this is your Aunt Olina.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Hey Sam.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
You’re not my aunt. My aunt’s name

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
is Sam too, I’m named after her.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Samantha, this is your aunt.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
She goes by Olina but her real
is Samantha, just like you.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Sam, my name is Sam.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
And who goes by the name Olina?
That's a stupid name.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Samantha, don’t talk to you aunt that way.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
My name is Sam! And you
can’t tell me what to do.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
You neither.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Becky, let me just wrestle
on this for a moment.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Oh it’s Rebecca.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Uh huh. You got a nasty mouth on you girl.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Don’t you ever come into my house
and mouth off at me, ya hear?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
You don’t have to stay
here if you don’t want to.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
But as long as you do, you will be civil

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
to me and to any… guest… in my house

07:37.000 --> 07:41.890
D'ya understand? And my name is Olina.

07:41.890 --> 07:43.000
Don’t you never nothing bad about my name.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.890
I might not be too crazy about
your name but it’s yours.

07:47.890 --> 07:51.000
So I’ll keep my trap shut
about it, understand?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Understand?!

07:53.000 --> 07:55.890
Ok.

07:55.890 --> 07:57.000
Good.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.890
Now let’s see about gettin’
you up to your room.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
Your room is at the top of the stairs here

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
and the john is right nearby.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Ya see, I do listen.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Well my word! This is nice.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Isn’t this nice Sam? Much nicer

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
than the room you had to share at the home.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Well, let’s leave Sam to
get settled in, shall we?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Uh, Sam, there’s plenty
of room in that closet

08:51.000 --> 08:55.890
and that chest of drawers
there, it’s empty.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
That was very thoughtful
the way that you prepared

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Sam’s room. It’s very comfortable.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And just remember Mrs. Batinger,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Olina.
Right, Olina.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.890
You will be a role model for this child.

09:34.890 --> 09:37.000
Time to go.
Pardon me?

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I said you can go now,
I can take it from here.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Oh no, I’d love to stay,
help you break the ice.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It is after all what I do.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Yes, I know you’d love
to help but I think our

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
ice is broken enough already.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Olina, I’m a highly trained social worker,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
well-equipped to handle any questions-

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Time. To. Go.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
I need the paperwork from last week.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Oh, no thank you. I really need

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
that paperwork for my manager.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
It’s in the bag.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Where’d you get that?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
Playing catch football
with the kids at home.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
Huh! Must’ve been some game.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
What's that smell?

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
Ah, what you’re smellin’ is the
fresh scent of cherry blossoms

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
in this can of room deodorizer.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
It smells like a hospital. Or an armpit.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
Well that armpit smell
young lady is probably you.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
Not me. When was the last time you bathed?
Was it … days?

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Weeks?!
I don’t remember.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Soon as you’re done eating,
you upstairs, shower,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
get yourself cleaned up.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
What? You don’t like pizza?
What kid doesn’t like pizza?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.300
It smells funny.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.450
Well I’m sorry Your Highness,
I ain't exactly a chef.

11:06.450 --> 11:11.000
If you want somethin' else you’re just
gonna have to go make it yourself.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.630
My stomach feels sick.

11:13.630 --> 11:15.630
You’ll get use to it.

11:15.630 --> 11:17.000
Clean up your plate when you’re done.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.630
Dearest Sam, Desdemona was my
favorite role in high school. Enjoy!

11:29.630 --> 11:31.630
Love, Your Mama

11:48.300 --> 11:51.000
I don’t know about this Elvis.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
I think I might’ve bitten
off more than I can chew.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
What’s with the dog?
Excuse me?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
This dead dog on the sofa. Why?

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Don’t!
What!?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Just don’t touch him, ok?

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Don’t worry Elvis she’s
not gonna bother you none.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
It’s a stuffed dog.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Well maybe to you that’s all he is.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
No, to anyone who’s normal,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
he’s a stiff and you’re a freaking looney.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
This is Elvis.
Elvis has been in my family for 12 years.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Some people go in for ashes.
I went in for taxidermy.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
That’s sick.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Well excuse me, not everybody’s perfect.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Sick can be cool you know.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Oh really, is that so?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Why don’t you just… get another dog?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
One that eats, breathes,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
moves, stuff like that?

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Because dead dogs don't fart.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
What does that mean?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Exactly what I said. Dead dogs don’t fart.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
They don’t cry, they don’t bark.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
They don’t get you up in
the middle of the night.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
You don’ have to clean up after them.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
They’re just… a lot simpler. That’s all.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Right. But they’re dead.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.300
Exactly.

13:37.300 --> 13:40.000
So social services sticks me with a lady

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
named Olina who talks to smelly old
dead dog named Elvis.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
You know it won’t break my heart

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
if you go back to that foster home.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I'm perfectly happy here with Elvis.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah okay, I’ll think about it, Olina.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Aunt Olina.
What?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Aunt Olina. I’m your aunt.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
You can call me Aunt Olina.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
That’s stupid.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
My house.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
My rules.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Oh girl. Did you take a shower

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
like I told you to?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Oh you got a nerve calling Elvis smelly.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
You’re the one that smells.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Not me. Well it sure ain’t Elvis.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Hey, don’t blame me

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
for whatever you smell.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Well dead dogs don’t fart but live girls

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
sure can stink.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Now you, upstairs.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Back up to that shower and

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
clean yourself properly and don’t come down

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
until you do. And don’t touch anything!

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And put your clothes all
in the washing machine!

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Now the whole room stinks.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Holy shit. Oh!

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Holy crap.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Yeah that’s right, holy crap.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I gotta clean up my language

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
for the kid Elvis.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
I gotta be a role model.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
What’s this?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Fold 'em.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
These aren’t all my clothes.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Did I ask whose clothes they are?

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
You’re sitting here doing nothin'.
Fold ‘em.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Hello. I’m not doing nothing, I’m reading.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Hello, too. I just did your stinky laundry.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Look, you’re not gonna
come waltzing in here

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
disrupt my peaceful existence and

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
expect to get waited on.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
As long as you’re gonna
stay here you’re gonna

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
have to learn to pull your own so fold ‘em.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
That blows chunks.
Oh just do it.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Whatcha reading there?
This trash or something? What is it?

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
Nothing. Give it back.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Othello? You’re reading Shakespeare?
Why not?

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
At least old Willy understood
that certain people

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
in the world are just born to be screwed.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
You? Screwed? You’re not screwed.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
You’re just gettin’ back on your feet.
That’s all.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Shakespeare knew that everybody
wants a piece of everybody else, you know.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
A pound of flesh thing. Those that
get caught in the middle are toast.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Sam, people aren’t all like that.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I know about people and they ARE like that.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
You don't know about people
because you don’t have any people.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
How do you know that?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
They looked for my relatives
for a year, you're it.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
And if I don’t have any
relatives, neither do you.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
Well, you might have a point there.
Alright, you finish reading

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
what you’re reading but then
you fold the clothes. All of them.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
What aren’t yours you put in a
nice, neat stack outside of my door.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Okay? Miss High and Mighty.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
You know,

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Shakespeare does make good reading.
Your mama?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
She liked the tragedies too.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Myself, I prefer Scarlett O’Hara

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
over Desdemona anyway.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Frankly, Olina, I don’t give a damn.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Read it in school.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Why did you and Mama never talk?

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Lake George.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
We was real close back then.

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
It’s complicated.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Mama said she was ashamed.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I guess we both were.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Of what?

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
Choices. Bad choices.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
I know about the bad choices she made,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
what about you?

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Men. Seems like your mama and I

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
could never get that
right when we were kids.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Are you talking about my dad?

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Yeah, your dad, he liked me first.
But I thought

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
he was an ass. He had
a really violent temper

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
right from the start.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
So, to get even with me
he went after your mama.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I tried to talk her out of it.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
But, she didn’t appreciate that much.

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
You see, women don’t like it
when you bad mouth their men.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
She was pretty pissed at me when she left.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
Well it looks like you called it right.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah. Sometimes being right

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
is the wrong way to be.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
It costs us both, being right.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Sam, did your father ever try — No.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
No what? I didn’t finish the question.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
He smacked me around some, that’s all.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
He was usually drunk.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
So I learned to dodge.

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
Mom wasn’t so lucky that one night.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Well you don’t ever have to
worry about that man again.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
Because he ain’t never gettin’ out.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Who’s this?

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Ah, that is your Uncle Bud.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
One of the right choices I made.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
What happened?

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
His country called.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
And then he got killed.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
But 7 men survived that day

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
because of Bud.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
My Bud, he came home in a pine box.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Did you have him stuffed too?

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
I should say not!
Why?

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Well because you don’t stuff people.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
Wax museum’s about the closest
you can come to stuffin’ people

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Mmm. So he’s in a wax museum?

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
No. But he should be.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
He was a great man.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
That’s enough talk about the past for now.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
Our baby will be filled with joy and
happiness. She will be our princess Olina.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Aloha. Love, Bud.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
Now what do we have here!?
Stay away! I’ve already called the cops.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Now you better put that thing away
before you hurt somebody.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Hey Elvis! How’s it going?

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Sit. Stay. Good boy!

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Who are you?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.500
Oh, I’m Larry. I must’ve misplaced my key

23:56.500 --> 24:01.000
so I had to make due with the window.
That’s bull. Olina doesn’t give out keys.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I’ve been here for two weeks
and I don’t even have a key.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
No kidding? Well I do. I mean I did.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
I don’t know what I’ve done with it.
What? Oh!

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Hahaha, you must be Sam.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
The long lost niece.
Maybe.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Well it’s a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Cops should be here any minute. Well the
cops aren’t gonna be interested in me.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
And why is that?

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
Because I own the house.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Liar! If you own the house
how come my aunt never mentioned you?

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Well I’ve been on the road and
in case you haven’t noticed,

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
your aunt’s not really the chatty type.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
You deliver mail on the road?
No.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
I don’t deliver mail on the road.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
You’re a mailman?
No.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
You are wearing a mailman uniform.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
I like the outfit.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
That is the stupidest
thing I have ever heard.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
That’s even stupider than
talking to a stuffed dog.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Well a body’s gotta talk to somebody.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
And might as well be a stuffed dog.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
And Elvis is a whole bunch more polite
than I can say about you.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Yeah, ok. You haven’t answered my question.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
Why are you in our house?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Our house.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
And I thought you were only staying here for a
few weeks until you found someplace better.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Mm. So you know all about me.
Yeah. I do.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
How?
Well Olina and I keep in touch.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I know that’s a lie. She
doesn’t talk to anybody.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
I thought I recognized
that truck out there!

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Welcome back!
How ya doin’ gorgeous?

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Not too shabby!

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Oh and don’t you look dashing as a postman.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
I see you two have met.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
So you two hooked up or something?

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
Sam, don’t be rude.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Larry and I go way back.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
Larry’s seen me through
some pretty tough times.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
So show a little respect. Besides, he could

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
kick us both out on our
asses… on our cans...

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
if you give him any trouble.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I don’t know. He’s kinda puny.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
I think I could take him.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.000
I don’t feel like celebrating.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
It’s the 4th of July and I want to party!

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
What about you Olina?
I got the hotdogs right here.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
That’s a start!

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
Thank you very much!

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I smell chocolate.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
Hand it over.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
I don’t know what you’re talkin’ about.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
What are you, part bloodhound?

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Larry, beer?
Yes please.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
Thank you.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
So, Aunt O. How come you never remarried?

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
It was just a lot simpler not to.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
Besides, there was never anyone like Bud.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
This was a really nice day.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Thank you Larry.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
My pleasure.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
I know how you and Bud
loved the Fourth of July.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Yup, we sure did.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
So how is it that neither of you have jobs?

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
Inheritance.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
And you let her live here for free?

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
I’m no freeloader! I pay rent every month,
on time I might add.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
That she does.
How about you?

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Why don’t you work?

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
Well, insurance settlement.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
For what?
Ah, well they were supposed

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
to remove my gallbladder

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
but they removed somethin’ else

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
that I don’t care to mention.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I invested the money in them erectile

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
dysfunction drugs.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I made me a shi-

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
a boat load of money.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
They messed with the wrong woman.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
That they did.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Again!?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Too many hotdogs.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
That’s the fourth time this week.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
That’s it child. You’re
going to see the doctor.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Mrs. Batinger, do you have

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
any medical history for Sam?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
The only medical history I have is what

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I’ve seen and heard for the last two weeks.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
You say this started about

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
3 months ago?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
You think there’s a reason for Sam to keep

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
something from you?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Apart from being a teenager?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
While you were still at the foster home?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I think it’s best if we discuss

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
this with Sam.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Sam, is there something you want to

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
tell your aunt?
No.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
You got something to say girl spit it out.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Doctor?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Sam is healthy.
Well that’s good.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Then why is she upchuckin'?

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Sam is expecting.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Expectin' what?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Best guess is 13 weeks.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
Elvis is not gonna like this.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
So you plan on keeping the baby?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
None of your business.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Well, I think as the baby is related to me

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
and seeing as how you live here

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
for now and seein’ as how

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Elvis and I might be somewhat affected by

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
the presence of a baby

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
not to mention that we’ve
suddenly inherited a teenager.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I think it absolutely is

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
my business to know if
you plan on keepin’ on it.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I don’t know.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I may not have a choice.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
If I’m living here I
guess you get to decide.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Oh no.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I don’t decide.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
If by some miracle you manage

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
to tough it out for the next

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
couple of months, that decision will have

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
nothing to do me.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I don’t make decisions
that affect other people.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
I just stay here in my house with Elvis.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
You keep the baby or not

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
that’s up to you.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Will you kick me out if I keep it?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Not if you survive

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
till then, which doesn’t seem too likely.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Like I said,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
it’s up to you.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
But my rules won’t change

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
not for you, not for it.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Now then, you got any

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
other surprises?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Good. You’re here.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Don’t you ever call before you

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
barge in on people?

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
As if you would answer.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I received a call from
Dr. Dempsey’s office.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Sam is pregnant! How did this happen?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Sam, would you like to
tell me how this happened?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
You need to get out more.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I didn’t mean that. I mean the father.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
What are you, my social worker or priest?

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Well it’s good to see things
appear to be calm here.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
How are you two getting along?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Kind of like the Capulets
and the Montagues.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Oh, that’s splendid. See I knew

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
you two would be able
to work things through.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I believe those are people in

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
play by Shakespeare.
They killed each other.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Oh! Yes of course. I remember now,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
the Capulets and the
Montenewts, Shakespeare dear.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Indeed. You know, not to get off topic.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
But there is something
that we need to discuss.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
And that’s getting Sam enrolled

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
in school for the fall.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Although, we’ll have to discuss a different

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
approach now that she’s expecting.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Yes, we will.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Sam, would you please
go up to your bedroom.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I need a few minutes alone

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
here with Becky.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
So, just what exactly is it

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
that the Department of Children

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
and Family Services oversees?

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
Now Olina, I can assure you.
Mrs. Batinger.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
OK, um, Mrs. Batinger, I can assure you

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
that we have contacted the
department up in Georgia.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
And that they’re looking into...

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
How the hell did this happen?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Well, I don’t know!

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
You folks don’t know much, do you?

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
Well we do what we can with
the resources that we have.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
What happens when the baby comes?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
What do you mean?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Do I keep the baby too?!

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
We’ve got plenty of time
to think about that.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I mean the doctor that Sam
is only 3-4 months along.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Can they make me?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Well,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
if you proceed with Sam’s legal adoption,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
then you would be the child’s guardian

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
and you would get to decide

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
what happens with the baby.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I don’t know about this. This is...

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
This is an awful lot for
me and Elvis to take in.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Right now it just seems like a big mistake.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
There are several options

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
available and I can council you

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
and your niece and bring you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
Mrs. Batinger, I know this
complicates the situation but

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
well I just want you to remember
that you are the only family Sam has.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Olina.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
You can call me Olina.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Okay, Olina.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
Sam?

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
Can I come in?

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Sam?

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Oh crap.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
Larry, I can’t find

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
her anywhere.
OK, OK. I’ll go look.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
You stay here in case
she comes back, alright.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
Where ya headed? Ya need a lift?

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
I should call the cops on you.
An old man picking up a young girl.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
I only pick up the ones I like.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
I knew living with my aunt
wasn’t gonna work out.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Now wait a minute don’t be so hasty.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
Come on, get in. Let’s talk some.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
This is one of my favorite hangouts.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
It’s where I come to escape.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
Get my mind a rest.

38:10.000 --> 38:16.000
Your aunt says your
mother doing theater too

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah. You two would’ve gotten along.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
Theater has a way of doing that.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
So does the father know?

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
Why should I tell you anything?

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
Sam, you gotta trust somebody.

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
Not you. You’re pretty
much still a stranger.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
You know Sam, when I was fighting overseas,

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
I found myself in some
pretty scary situations.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
I needed someone to trust and

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
all the people around me were strangers.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
And I realized I wasn’t
the only one in need.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Those guys needed someone to trust too.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Sam, we’re all strangers till

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
we find ourselves in need of one another.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
That’s different.
Wait, wait, here me out. I had to trust

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
that those guys had my back.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
Those strangers became my friends.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
My buddies. My family.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
They saved my life.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
I can’t trust anybody.
Sam, that’s not true. Wait!

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
You know your aunt

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
loves you a great deal,
you know that, right?

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
She said I was a mistake.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
She didn’t mean that.

39:37.000 --> 39:43.000
Look she’s just trying to figure
everything out just like you are.

39:43.000 --> 39:49.000
She says something without thinking and

39:49.000 --> 39:55.000
… your aunt lost a baby.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
Her baby.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
It was right after Bud went overseas.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
I didn’t know.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
She doesn’t like to talk about it much.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
Sam, you need to talk to her.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
She’s your kin.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
You can trust her.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
You must be hungry, I fixed you some food.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
It’s on the table.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
Thank you.
Sure.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
I’m very happy that
you’ve decided to go ahead

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
with Sam’s adoption.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
Well, Elvis gave it the okay.
Well, I’m very glad that Elvis is on board.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Now, Olina. We’ve got a few things that
we need to discuss. One of them

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
is Sam’s education. Have you enrolled
her yet? School starts in two weeks.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
Can’t she just wait until
after the baby comes?

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
I’m afraid not. Sam’s only 15,
the state has it’s regulations.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
She needs to be enrolled in school.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
Well that just absolutely blows chunks.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Excuse me? Oh that’s what Sam
would say if she were here.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
That absolutely blows chunks.
She says that a lot.

41:25.000 --> 41:31.000
Well, be that as it may, we need to get her
enrolled within the week.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
There’s Umatilla High and then Brooksfield.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
It’s a private school.
Brooksfield?

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Isn’t that for druggies
and dropouts and flunkies

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
and teen moms? Well not always.
Really?

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
Well what about homeschoolin’?
I could homeschool her.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
Olina, I don’t think that that would
be possible. I mean, you’d have to have

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
a college degree to qualify.
Got one.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
You do? Right as rain I do.
A degree in English lit from the

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
University of Florida. 3.8 GPA

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Dean’s list, honors in
my field and cum laude.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Thank you very much.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
Um, OK well I’d have
to send it credentials.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
Can you produce credentials?
Oh I think I could dig up some credentials.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
Would my transcript and
diploma do the trick?

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
That’s just unbeliev — remarkable.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
And I’m sure that we could look into it.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
Who’s homeschooling me?
Why do people think I can’t handle this?

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
Says the lady who talks to her dead dog.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
Well you know, you can always go to that

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
private school with the snobs.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
What do you say Elvis?

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Classmates? When do we start?

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Yeah that’s what I thought.
But I’m not doing any homework.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Oh you’ll do as I say. And since you'll

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
be at home, it’ll all be homework.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Ya hear that Elvis? We’ll have homework?

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
These are some brochures

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
that Miss Prissy Pants gave us for

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
… for options after the baby comes.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
Do you think I’m doing the right thing?

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
Oh honey, I think you made a very

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
brave decision to have this baby.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
I think a lot of girls in
your position would’ve…

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
well I think you’ve been very mature
about the whole thing.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
But Sam honey,

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
you’re still just a kid.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
I really think you should
think about adoption.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
I have thought about it.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
This one’s about something that they

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
call “open adoption” where

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
you get to stay in touch.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
And it gets to know who you are.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Her. The doctor said it’s a girl.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
Not an It.
I know.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
I … didn’t mean anything
by calling her an It.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
I know.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
Would I get to pick the parents?

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
If that’s what I decide I mean?
Yes I think you would.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Rebecca said you get to
interview the couples.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Find out if you like them. Check ‘em out.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
See if they’ll give It…
give her a good home.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
I really screwed everything up, didn’t I?

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Oh no, no, no child you didn’t screw it up.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
We’ll get through this, you’ll see.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
Bad time?

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Oh.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Aunt O’s gonna homeschool me.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
Wow, I’m sorry.
You too!?

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
What’s next?

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
Girl we’ve been at this for two weeks now.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
You know what to do. Look,
check your parenthesis.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
It’s too many Xs and Ys. I don’t get this.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
Yes you do. What’s the matter?
Nothing.

44:58.000 --> 45:04.000
Sam, it’s okay to be upset today.
I’m not upset.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
I just hate math.
No you don’t. You’re great at math.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
People don’t have what they’re good at.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
Are you nervous?
I’m not nervous. Just

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
leave me alone.
Sorry, not my job.

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
Ok. That’s enough for today.
We gotta clean up

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
for our guests anyway. Why don’t
you go upstairs and get ready.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
Hello.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
You must be Olina, the aunt?

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
That would be me.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
And you must be the Smiths.
The potential adopting parents.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
So. Is Smith your real last name?

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
Excuse me?
It just sounds fake.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
Like you’re undercover or somethin’.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Uh, no.
No.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
Smith is our real last name.
I just thought,

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
maybe they gave you the name Smith
to protect your real identity?

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
You know, in case nobody likes you.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
Yes, Sam.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
Smith is Frank and Susan’s real last name.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
I know. Why don’t we talk about the baby.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
Oh good idea. So, Frank,

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
Susan, why do you wanna adopt a baby?

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Hi!

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
We’re the Armands.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Hi, I’m Jennifer and this
is my husband Jeffrey.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
We’re the Dempsey’s. Please to meet you.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
We love children.
We already have

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
7 but we’re just beggin’ for another.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
Are you having a boy or girl?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Are you having a boy or girl?
I hate them.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
I grew up in Miami

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
but I like the small town atmosphere.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
You get to know your neighbors,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
the storeowners, the schoolteachers.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
See, that’s good! You know this stuff.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
Our friend’s son wants to go to college
outside the state. Do you know how much

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
that’s gonna cost? No way.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
I really hate them.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
I’ve been through all sorts of
procedures trying to get pregnant.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
It can be humiliating.
And expensive.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
Children can be a real joy you know.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
Yes, except for your sister’s kids.
Well they just need some discipline.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
We’re firm in believers
in discipline you know.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
And then we tried adopting a Russian baby

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
And you would not believe how
much that is going to cost.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
They were gonna make us
fly all the way over there.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
To Russia! Can you believe that?

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
I really really hate them.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Well my wife and I aren’t able
to have children of our own.

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
Yes, but we want children
more than anything.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
Why do we want to adopt, well that’s easy!
Who in their right minds

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
would want to bring children
of their own into this world?

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
We’ve owned a hardware store
downtown for several years.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
We’re not overly wealthy but we…

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
I know we can give your
child a comfortable life.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
Nah.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
Yeah.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
What do you say Elvis? Who would you pick?

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
Well, thank you for
giving us the opportunity

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
to get to know each other a little better.

49:01.000 --> 49:07.000
Yes, thank you and thank
you for bringing Elvis.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
Can I get you anything? Water? Soda?

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
No. What about Elvis? Can
we get Elvis anything?

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
You do know he’s dead, right?

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
Yes, uh,

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
I know that. Sorry.

49:25.000 --> 49:31.000
I was just, trying to lighten
the mood a little bit.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
Sam, the Jacobsons have a

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
nice home, don’t they?

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
It’s alright.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
Do you like our backyard, Sam?
It’s big right?

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
We’re planning to get a
swingset for the baby.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
Oh, well that’s a splendid idea.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
And we have lots of nieces and nephews.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
We’re actually thinking about getting

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
a dog for ourselves.
A live one of course.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Maybe a shih tzu, I don’t know, I hear

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
they’re very gentle.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
There’s a dog named after shit?

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
Oh, no it’s a Chinese dog. It’s um,

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
I don’t know…

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
I don’t think it means anything in English.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
It’s just um… The baby will sleep.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
in our room for the first
few months you know,

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
so it’ll be close by.
Do you have a john?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Excuse me?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
I have to pee.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
Oh.
Yeah it’s just down

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
the hall on the left.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
So uh, Olina,

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
Do you have any other relatives nearby?

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Nope, it’s just been me and Elvis

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
for the past 15 years.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
Well, and of course now Sam.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
So um, what would you do if the baby

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
is allergic to the dog?

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
What dog?

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
The dog you’re gonna adopt.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
The one that’s named after shit.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
I mean what would you do
if the baby’s allergic?

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
Well, I hadn’t

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
given that any consideration.
I mean, I guess...

51:53.000 --> 51:59.000
that’s something we should think about.
What do you think?

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
Certainly the baby’s
health would come first.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
Of course, the baby would
be our top priority.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
But I mean I guess we
could make arrangements

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
for the dog or…
Right. Like a nice new home.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
You know, for the dog.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
You’d give away your own dog?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
How could you just give up your own dog?

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
It’s not the dog’s fault.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Sam, I am sure that they would
see to it that the dog was

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
well taken care of.
Yes, it’s just that

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
we’ve wanted a child for so

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
long that we would do anything
to be good parents

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
really, we would.
If you’d abandon your own dog

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
how do I know you
wouldn’t abandon my child?

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
Sam nobody plans on abandoning anybody.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
No, of course not. I mean…

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
Oh I’m afraid I’m not doing very
well here, Jeffrey help me out.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
Sam, what my wife is trying to say is…
AND WHERE ARE THE BANANAS?

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Olina, you’re right, the
child’s just not well.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Don’t touch me!

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I smell bananas, I HATE bananas.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
They make me sick.
I think I’m gonna be sick.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
I’m so sorry. I think we may
have some bananas in the kitchen.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
I don’t like you!

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
I don’t like them, they are NOT

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
taking my baby!

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
It’s alright dear, please calm down.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Yes please. We’re really very good people,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
we go to church, we donate to charities…

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
We recycle!

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I think we should leave.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I think that might be best.
We can try again another time.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
I mean it. I'm gonna puke.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Jeffrey, do something!

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Sam!

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Well that was fun.
Shut up!

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Girl I’ve a good mind to… you know what!
There’s no

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
excuse for behavior like that.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
No excuse?
No.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
How about my father killing mom?

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
How about this little girl I’m carrying?

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
The one with ten fingers and

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
ten toes, the one that kicks me

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
every few minutes. The
one that I want to keep!

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Yeah that’s right, I want to keep her!

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
And you try to make me give her away.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
No Sam! No I’m not!

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
You don’t have to give her
up if you don’t want to.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
I don’t like them. They’re dog haters.
They have too many J’s in their name.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
They’re ordinary and stupid
and boring and ugly and

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
they’d probably, probably be mean
to my baby. They might even give her

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
away too. I DON’T… don’t like them.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
They are not keeping my baby.
It’s okay child.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
You know you don’t have to decide anything,

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
anything today. You know,
you don’t even have to think

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
about it. Now let’s just

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
let’s just think about something else, OK?

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
Scarlett O’Hara

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
and Gone with the Wind?
That’s right. Just like Scarlett.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
We’ll think about it tomorrow or next week.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
But let’s not think about it right now, OK?

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
Let’s think about something else.
What do you want

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
to think about?
Not bananas. I hate bananas.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
And not smelly people.
Not bananas, not smelly people.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
and not shitzus.
Not shih tzus..

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
Do we have any chocolate?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
At home, yeah!
And cucumbers?

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I think so, yeah.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Marshmallows?
Crap!

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
No marshmallows?!

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
No, I forgot Elvis!

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I want to name her after you.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
OK then, we’ll

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
name her Sam Junior.
No.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
I want to name her Olina Jr.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Alright then, that’s what we’ll do.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
I don’t really

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
know what I want to do right now, you know.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I don’t know what’s best

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
I just really wish I knew what was best.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I know. I know.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
So do I child, so do I.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
But let’s not think

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
about that right now.
Tomorrow’s another day.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
OK.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
Come on, come on, come
we haven’t got all day.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Don’t get your panties in a wad.
I’m thinking.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
Hey, I do not wear panties.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
I wear boxer shorts.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Oversharing!
And that’s not a very lady-like expression

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
by the way. What? Oversharing?
No.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
The thing about the uh, you know.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
Well golly jee Uncle Larry, I’m not

56:28.000 --> 56:34.000
exactly in a lady-like situation, am I?

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
Well, I mean I don’t know about that.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
Have you spoken to your boyfriend?

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
Ew! I do not have a boyfriend.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
Well then have you talked to the boy

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
who is your friend, who is also the father?

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
I’ll take three.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
I am going to stick.

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
You are toast, yogi.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
Huh, alright, alright.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
I’ll call.
I have got two pair.

57:22.000 --> 57:27.000
Kings over Jacks.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
Sorry pal. Aces and Eights.

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
Read and weep. And he

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
tips his hat to the crowd!

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
Those were my last ones! You
know, I need energy right now,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I need extra calories.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
These are not the calories that you need.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
You need to get out, you need see

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
the world, you need to exercise.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
Yeah, not a chance. I’ve
got nothing to wear.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
He wants nothing to do with the baby.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
Anyway, I better go do my chores before

58:11.000 --> 58:17.000
Aunt O gets her panties in a wad.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
Nothing in this hand, nothing in this hand…

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
Ta-da!

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
What the hell is this?

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
Language!
Yeah, OK I’m sorry, what the

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
freaking royal crap is this!?
That is vintage

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
Ester Williams!
Come on! Rita Hayworth!

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
Pinup Girls!
For me? What are you nuts?

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
Of course it’s for you!
Go on hold it up!

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
That looks nice!
Where am I supposed

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
to wear this thing anyway?
We’re all going out

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
to the lake.
Yeah. No. I am not wearing this

59:02.000 --> 59:08.000
circus tent in public.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Sam, you comin’ out?

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
I look like a beached whale.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
A mighty pretty one at that though.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
Larry don’t tease her.
I hate this! Let’s go home.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
Sam, we just got here. Just

59:32.000 --> 59:38.000
give it a chance.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
I can’t see my feet!

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
Sam, come on, let’s go in the water.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
It’ll be fun! Sam, come on.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
I hate the water.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
Do you have any candy bars?

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
You are somethin’ else.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I’ll make you a deal.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I’ll let you have the candy bar if you

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
talk about Atlanta and your friend.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Who happens to be a boy.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
What do you wanna know?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Why?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Why not?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
That’s it?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Yeah. We were both

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
depressed, tired, looking for something

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
permanent… I don’t know.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
You didn’t think it through?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Obviously not.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Oh sorry! Do you want to come play with us?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Trick or treat!

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
What!?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery!

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Open the door… Sam!

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It’s locked, I can’t get in, I’m serious!

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
So Sam, have you given any thought

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
to the Jacobsons?
What Jacobsons?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
The couple we met a few weeks ago?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
No. I don’t like them.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
OK. We can interview another couple or…

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Sam, I don’t mean to pressure
you but we really need —

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Sure sounds like pressure to me.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
The Jacobsons are a lovely couple.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
OK, I’ll get another round

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
of parents together and we’ll —
Rebecca.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I’m keeping my baby.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Aunt O said I could.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Olina, are you sure you know
what you’re doing? I mean

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
a baby is a big responsibility.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I can help.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I love kids.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Aunt O,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
how do you really feel

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
about me keeping her?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
That’s a life changing decision, child.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
For a lot of people.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I just, I don’t

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
want her to have to live with some

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
foster clowns like I had to.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Well that’s not a reason to keep a baby.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Besides, if you do give
her up for adoption,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
the Jacobsons wouldn’t
be her foster parents,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
they’d be her parents.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So you’re saying I shouldn’t keep her.
No.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
What I’m saying is

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I think you should do

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
what’s best for your
baby, not what you want

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000
and not what I want.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Will this change whether
I - or we- get to stay?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Do you do you want me to leave?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
No I don’t! Are you still lookin' to leave

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Well, you sure need

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
someone around here to keep your place up,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
cuz ya can’t do it.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
No I can’t. But apart from that,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
You belong with me.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
We’re family.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
She’s family too.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Yes she is.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
It’s times like these when I miss him most.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Even after all these years.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Maybe we should go see him.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Yeah, yeah, maybe we should.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Bud, this is Sam.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
She’s Maddie’s little girl.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Real nice kid.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:57.000
You would’ve liked her.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I see most of your buddies
every now and then.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
They’re all doin’ fine.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Larry tells me that
Cornwall had a grandbaby.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
All thanks to you, darlin’.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And Charlie has three! Imagine.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Why are there coins on these headstones?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
They’re symbolic markers.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Some people leave followers, others…

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
whatever’s meaningful.
You leave a penny when

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
you want to let the other family know
that the soldier’s been visited.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
A nickel means that the visitor was in
boot camp with the solider.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And a dime means they served together.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And um… so on.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I’m keeping up my end
of the bargain, buddy.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
You kept yours.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I don’t feel good.
We’re gonna be home soon.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
But we have to stop by
Miss Prissy’s office first.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
She’s got some more papers for us.
It’ll be fine.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
It’ll be worth it in the end, you’ll see.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I know it’s been a lot of work.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
But trust me, you’re
almost through the process.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
It’s only a matter of days now.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
What’s the matter child?
It hurts.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
What hurts?
It hurts, I can’t stand it

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
it… ohhh…

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I’m all wet, I think peed myself.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Could she be in labor?
Good work, Sherlock.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
No honey, you didn’t wet yourself,
your water’s broke.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
It means it’s time to take you in.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Oh man, this totally sucks.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I’m gonna hurl.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
OK, how many pains?
Maybe ten?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
How far apart?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I don’t know! They just keep getting closer

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
and closer.
OK, we’re gonna go in right now.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
It’s too early.
No. it’ll be fine.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I got toilet paper from the bathroom!

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
What good is that gonna do?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Well I don’t know, they didn’t
teach me this in training!

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Just hold on to me, that’s it.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
OK, now remember your breathing, OK?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
What’s going on?!

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Oh we’re going into labor.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Labor?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Labor!

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
God! Oh jeez that’s not good.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
What’s happening!?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
You’re havin’ a baby!

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
In the parking lot for Christ’s sakes!
LANGUAGE!

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Just breathe.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I am!
Not you!

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
OK just breathe like we, like we practiced.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
How do you know what to do?
Television.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Oh that’s comforting.
Just stay calm.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
How can I stay calm!?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
What?!

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Gas receipt…

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Aunt O….O… O.. OHHHHHHH!

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I got a Twix!
Oh I want that!

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Sam, it’s time to get the
baby’s things together.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
They’ll be here any minute.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I’ll get it, let her stay.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Thanks.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
This is what’s best.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
This is what’s best for her.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I think so too.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
It’s just always hard
to let go of loved ones.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I’ll still have you. I’ll still have Larry.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000
You know, you’ve made a really

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
selfless decision, I’m mighty proud of you.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Thank you.
You’re welcome.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Oh Jeffrey! Look at her.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000
She’s so beautiful.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
How have you been, Sam?
We heard you had a rough time of it.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Well, other than nearly
giving birth in a jeep.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
It was a piece of cake.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
She has a keen sense of humor Jeffrey.
You know that

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
indicates intelligence.
I know the baby is going to be very bright.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Gosh, she’s so small.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
The Jacobsons are very
grateful to you, Sam.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Of course we are.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I think that’s everything.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
She needs to be sung to sleep.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
She won’t fall asleep
unless you sing to her.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Now Sam, she will be in very capable hands,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
don’t worry about a thing.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Rebecca, of course she’s gonna worry.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I mean, this can’t be easy for Sam.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Is it, sweetheart?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It’s OK.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
You know, you can come
see her anytime you want.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
And we’ll invite you to birthday parties

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
and on holidays, we really want you

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000
to be a part of the family.
Would you like that?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Yes. I would.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
We want Janice to know you the entire

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
time she’s growing up, Sam.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Janice? Yeah.
Yeah, that’s what we thought we’d name her.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Janice Jacobson.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Not another J name.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
What do you mean?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
You said I could pick her name.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Oh, that’s right.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
We did. I forgot about that.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:42.000
OK Sam, what would you like to name her?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I want to name her after my aunt.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Oh.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Olina?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
You want to name the baby Olina? I mean

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
that’s a very unusual name.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Sam, the Jacobsons have a right to choose
the name of their child.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
No, Rebecca.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
It’s OK.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
We did promise Sam. She wants to name

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000
the baby after her aunt, so…

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Samantha.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
You could name her Samantha.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
That is my real name.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
You said you don’t like that name.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Well I like it now.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Well so do I.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I think Samantha’s a great name.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Is that alright with you Sam?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I think it’s good. I like it too.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Wonderful now everybody’s happy.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Anyway, we better get going.
Is everybody ready?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
No.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
What?
I’m not ready.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Sam, please don’t change your mind. I’m
not changing my mind. I’m just not ready.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Sam, we went to a lot of
trouble to make arrangements

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
to do this today and you can’t just —
Rebecca. Please.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Just, let me handle this, OK?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000
She can do this whatever way she wants

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Sam, just tell us what you need, OK?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I need a moment with my baby.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Of course you do.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Come on everybody let’s give her
some space. I don’t know if this…

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
will be productive. I mean.
Rebecca!

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Jen’s right, OK?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Sam, you take all the time you need, OK?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Samantha.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
You’re so beautiful.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I hope you’ll always know that.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
And I hope that

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
you’ll always be loved, more than anyone

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
could ever be.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Actually, I know that you already are.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
By so many people.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
But nobody could ever love you

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
more than I love you right
now at this very moment.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
One day, you’ll see that.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
And you’ll know that I
had to love you that much.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
…to give you away.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I wish things could be different.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
But you deserve the best. You deserve

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
everything that I didn’t have

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
and they’ll give that to you.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.000
God you look like so much like mom.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I can’t give you what you

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
deserve right now.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I’ve been pretty screwed up with

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
too much going on inside of me.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000
But I know one thing that’s not screwed up.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
You’re the best thing that’s
ever happened in this world,

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
no matter how you got here.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
You’re the best of me,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
of mom, and of Aunt O.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And you’ll live a happy life.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I know you will.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Mommy loves you so much.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Goodbye my little angel.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Ok. Let's go.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Oh baby girl.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Thank you.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
No good… no sense in
this dragging this out!

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Rebecca, why don’t you wait for us outside?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Oh no, that’s really alright.
I’m the social worker afterall

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I should … be … here…

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
You know I worked really hard on this case.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
It was like two adoptions!

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Sam,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I know that you’re making a
huge sacrifice for this baby.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And we promise that we’ll be good parents

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
and we will raise her the best that we can.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
And she will know that her

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
birth mother loved her very much.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
So much that she…

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Thank you.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Thank you so much.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Thank you, Sam.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Anybody hungry?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Guess not.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
It’s ok to cry baby. Hey,
I just might cry with you.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Oh, Sam.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
It’s gonna get better, you’ll see.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
We’re gonna get you into a school and
you’re gonna make new friends

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
and you’ll go to dances and football

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
games and pep rallies.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Aunt O?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Yeah babe?
Hand me the room spray.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Ok.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Give it all ya got.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Oh God! You feel better?
Yeah.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Thanks.
Aunt O?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Mmm baby?
Can I get a dog?

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Yeah, you can get a dog.
I want one from the animal shelter.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
We’ll go tomorrow.
Sounds like we got a plan.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Yes it does. Sounds like we got us a plan.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000
“I never knew that I needed you”

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000
“Thought I was fine on my own”

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.000
“Now that you’re here, everything is clear"

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:12.000
“We’re better off together than alone”

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Three of a kind! Let’s see you beat that.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000
What? Full House! Read ‘em and weep.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Pay up! Come on.
I was tryin’ to quit anyway.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.000
You stayin’ for dinner?
Yes, mam.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Alright.
What is that smell?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Uh, dog farts.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Dog farts. Oh for God sa…. Samantha!

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Will you please come downstairs and
take the King of Flatulence outside?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Come on, Melissa! Grab Speedy.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I thought we discussed one dog.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Well…

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Oh Lord.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000
“Ooooo got you by my side now”

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
“Ooooo there’s no need to hide now”

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
“We’re more than blood and
water, more than memories”

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:20.000
“I am mother’s daughter,
and you’re my missing piece"

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000
“It takes time to change
your mind, time to realize

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000
“And see, my life was just beginning”

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
“The day that you were brought to me.
Could it be”

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:47.000
“That, oooo got you by my side now”

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:54.000
“Oooo there’s no need to hide now.
We’re more than blood and water"

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:01.000
“More than memories.
I am my mother’s daughter”

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:08.000
“You’re my missing piece”

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Ooooo

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.000
"Got you by my side now. Ooooo
so there’s no need to hide now"

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:29.000
“Got you by my side. Got you by my side.
Got you by my side”

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:38.000
"Got you by my side.
Ooooo got you by my side"

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:53.250
“Got you, got you, by my side.”
