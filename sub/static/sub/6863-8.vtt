WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.237
The Wilkes are strangers.
Families are hard.

00:03.271 --> 00:05.239
But what if the Wilkes
are amazing?

00:05.273 --> 00:07.175
The reason that we're so much
alike is because we're cousins.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.777
The way it works with family
is you get out what you put in

00:09.810 --> 00:10.844
and you've put in nothing.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.513
It just hurts knowing
that I can't be a part of it.

00:12.546 --> 00:13.747
Well, maybe the Wilkes
will come around.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.116
LYNLY:
I might have made
a teensy mistake

00:15.149 --> 00:16.617
and told Lavon we're together.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.352
All that time you're looking me
in the eye and didn't tell me.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.221
Lynly and I,
we're not going away.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.590
So, you can bury
your head in the sand

00:22.623 --> 00:24.758
or you can grow up
and you can accept it.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.061
I was letting the past hold me
back, but no more.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.130
There's something that I really
need to show you.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.399
Just to confirm, that is the
woman that you were engaged to.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.567
Oh, my Lord.

00:44.445 --> 00:47.281
And.... of course.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.849
Hey, Vivian.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.851
Don't you wear shoes?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.487
Funny story.
Joel's grandmother's visiting

00:53.521 --> 00:54.688
and she needed hair spray
right away.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.490
And the Dixie Stop
isn't open yet, so...

00:56.524 --> 00:57.691
Hilarious.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.360
Right?

00:59.393 --> 01:00.761
Hey, how are you?

01:00.794 --> 01:02.730
Did you happen to get
those apology balloons I sent?

01:02.763 --> 01:04.165
And do you accept?

01:04.197 --> 01:05.299
Yes and no.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.101
No, you didn't get
the balloons?

01:07.135 --> 01:08.102
I have a receipt.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.703
No, you are not forgiven
for crashing my son's

01:09.737 --> 01:10.838
birthday party
and lying to my family.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.706
Oh. Okay.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.242
Well, that's too bad.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.144
Joel's grandmother,
she is here Hanukkah,

01:16.177 --> 01:17.845
and I bet I know
what you're thinking,

01:17.878 --> 01:19.247
Hanukkah already?
Clearly you don't.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.281
Yes, I know, it is early.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.649
Crazy early, right?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.684
So, his grandfather died
just last year,

01:23.717 --> 01:25.519
and Grandma Sylvie came
all the way to BlueBell

01:25.553 --> 01:28.589
to celebrate because
family is so very, very

01:28.622 --> 01:30.591
important, as is forgiveness.

01:30.624 --> 01:31.792
Please hurry. I beg you.
I'll bag myself.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.461
And so she's cooking this very
large Hanukkah dinner tomorrow

01:33.494 --> 01:35.296
night, and I was thinking
that maybe you

01:35.329 --> 01:37.465
and some of the other Wilkes
could stop by.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.732
Put all this weird stuff
behind us.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.601
Dr. Hart, we're not
gonna put it behind us.

01:40.634 --> 01:43.437
Ever. Let it go.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.276
Just the hair spray.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.549
LAVON:
That's a lot of
pancakes there.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.750
Yes.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.752
I'm very hungry.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.854
So excited for
the Harvest Festival.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.590
And Danielle Bradbery's
playing?

02:02.623 --> 02:04.292
Huge score, Lavon.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.826
You're bringing those to George,
aren't you?

02:07.495 --> 02:08.895
He's in the carriage house.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.632
Lavon, George and I
are a couple now.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.701
I hope you'll start
accepting that.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.303
ZOE:
Hey, guys.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.571
Uh... that breakfast

02:17.605 --> 02:19.373
is for people who
actually live here.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.809
Oh, come on, I've been up
for hours, and I'm starving.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.245
Also, I need a favor.

02:24.278 --> 02:27.248
Okay, so Joel's
grandma, Sylvie--

02:27.281 --> 02:29.250
sweet, old,
recently widowed Sylvie--

02:29.283 --> 02:31.319
she wants to make Hanukkah
dinner tomorrow night,

02:31.352 --> 02:33.487
but Joel and I,
we don't have a kitchen,

02:33.521 --> 02:34.555
or a dining room,

02:34.588 --> 02:37.458
so I was hoping that maybe
we could have it here.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.526
Pretty please.

02:38.559 --> 02:39.693
No problem.
Hanukkah dinner.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.229
Cool.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.230
Oh, thank you.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.597
LYNLY:
Sorry to be so ignorant,

02:43.631 --> 02:45.433
but what does Hanukkah
celebrate exactly?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.901
It's the festival of lights.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.303
Mm. Sounds beautiful.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.671
But why the lights?

02:50.704 --> 02:54.475
To honor the Jews'
triumph against oppression.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.909
Nice. By whom?

02:55.943 --> 02:57.345
Hmm?

02:57.378 --> 02:59.547
(chuckles)
You have no idea, do you?

02:59.580 --> 03:00.581
Please.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.616
There was the oil
that burned for eight days.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.652
There were Maccabees involved.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.953
Potato pancakes.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.421
(singsongy):
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.789
WADE:
Mmm...

03:08.822 --> 03:10.291
(door closes)
pancakes.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.559
Yum.
Anyway...

03:11.592 --> 03:13.794
you all are invited
to Hanukkah dinner.

03:13.827 --> 03:14.928
Even you, Wade, because,
for whatever reason,

03:14.962 --> 03:16.430
Joel loves you.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.732
Aw, I love him, too.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.900
Ow!

03:22.270 --> 03:23.971
I mean... wow.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.307
Hanukkah.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.377
(chuckles):
Wade, you best see
a dentist, man.

03:29.410 --> 03:32.313
What? You best see a shrink
'cause y'all are crazy.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.581
I didn't even want
that stupid apple.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.715
I want pancakes.
That's what I want.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.850
Hey, uh...

03:36.884 --> 03:38.886
Yeah.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.455
(Brick exhales loudly)

03:41.489 --> 03:42.590
Daddy.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.524
What are you doing?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.459
Oh, I'm doing exactly
what I have been doing

03:45.493 --> 03:47.328
since we saw Shelby.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.562
I'm freaking out.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.564
Okay, listen, I know that
seeing her condition

03:50.598 --> 03:52.666
was unsettling.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.269
(laughs):
Oh, unsettling?

03:55.303 --> 03:56.570
There have been cataclysmic
earthquakes

03:56.604 --> 03:58.306
that have been less unsettling.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.608
I'm having a baby!

04:00.641 --> 04:02.410
A baby. At my age.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.713
I have to call my banker
and liquidate some assets.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.482
Yeah, 'cause Shelby, she's
going to need a-a safer car

04:08.516 --> 04:11.619
and a, oh, and a very,
very, very good nanny.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.986
Maybe a house.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.455
(gasps):
Classic Shelby.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.523
No one's even spoken to her,

04:15.556 --> 04:16.890
and she's already finagled
her way into a house.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.892
No, I-I intend to speak
with her today.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.596
Oh, no, Daddy,
you can't.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.997
Had you not seen the light
at the last minute,

04:24.031 --> 04:25.766
you'd be married to her
right now.

04:25.799 --> 04:30.438
Oh, she does, she...
does have an effect on me.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.639
Listen, you are to go
straight to your office.

04:31.672 --> 04:32.573
Don't even look up.

04:32.606 --> 04:36.310
Okay? I will figure out
if Shelby's spawn

04:36.344 --> 04:37.645
is actually your baby

04:37.678 --> 04:39.880
and my future sibling,

04:39.913 --> 04:41.882
and we'll determine a course
of action from there.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.050
It's going to
be fine, Daddy.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.018
Okay? Remember.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.321
Straight to the office.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.664
I feel like Lavon is
definitely coming around.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.667
Still, we should probably avoid
the carriage house for a while.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.669
Yeah, I think
we should, too,

05:01.702 --> 05:03.804
because the last thing we want

05:03.837 --> 05:06.807
to have happen is him bust in
on us while we're, uh...

05:07.775 --> 05:10.411
Lemon, knock! We are occupied!

05:10.444 --> 05:11.945
And naked.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.914
Yes, yes, it's nothing I haven't
seen before. Hello, Lynly.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.849
George, there are matters
more important

05:15.883 --> 05:17.351
than your carnal pleasures.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.752
Shelby's back,
she bought Fancie's,

05:18.786 --> 05:20.053
and she's about
seven months pregnant.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.922
No!
Who's Shelby?

05:21.955 --> 05:23.357
Brick's ex-girlfriend.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.958
Of about seven months.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.494
Ooh...

05:26.527 --> 05:27.828
And Daddy's about to fall back
into her clutches.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.363
And since Shelby is your fault,

05:29.397 --> 05:30.698
you get to help me prevent this.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.733
Wait, how is she
George's fault?

05:32.766 --> 05:35.035
Shelby and I dated first.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.871
So, your ex-fiancÃ©e's father
dated your ex-girlfriend?

05:37.905 --> 05:40.708
Yes, right before he started
dating Wade's ex-wife.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.110
It's a small town-- catch up.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.112
And seven months ago,
Shelby did not have the money

05:45.145 --> 05:47.781
to buy a fancy restaurant
like Fancie's, so...

05:47.815 --> 05:49.817
She's got a sugar daddy.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.118
Well, let's hope so.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.053
A sugar daddy
with very potent sperm.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.523
I'll speak to Frank,
see what I can dig up.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.857
I'll find out about
the Fancie's sale.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.726
I'll be the sexy,
wisecracking sidekick.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.862
We'll rendezvous at noon.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.697
Okay, so we got the brisket.
Obviously...

06:03.731 --> 06:04.965
There you are,
Zoe, sweetheart.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.800
Hi.
Hey.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.669
Oh...

06:08.702 --> 06:10.604
Thank you for saving

06:10.638 --> 06:11.805
my updo.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.140
I know it was a lot to ask.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.075
Oh, no, no, not at all.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.745
You want something
to eat?
Oh, no, you know what?
I-I can't.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.013
I have to rush to the office.
I just came to say hi.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.815
Oh, a doctor.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.884
Just saying the word

06:23.917 --> 06:25.719
fills me with pride.

06:25.753 --> 06:26.987
My late husband
and I wanted

06:27.020 --> 06:28.255
Joel to become one.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.024
I was short-listed for
the National Book Award,
but, you know...

06:31.058 --> 06:33.827
(laughs):
So, what are you two
up to today?

06:33.861 --> 06:35.563
We're planning our menu
for Hanukkah dinner,

06:35.596 --> 06:36.730
which is going
to be great.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.865
It is such an honor

06:37.898 --> 06:39.733
to eat at the mayor's.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.135
And I am so excited to meet
all of Joely's friends,

06:42.169 --> 06:44.772
like the wonderful Wade

06:44.805 --> 06:46.974
he keeps talking about.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.175
Oh, and, Zoe,

06:48.208 --> 06:50.444
I am so excited
to meet your family.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.112
Of course
you'll invite them, right?

06:52.145 --> 06:54.047
Yeah, I did,
but they're not coming.

06:54.081 --> 06:57.485
I just completely and utterly
blew it with the Wilkes.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.786
But it's done,

06:58.819 --> 07:00.654
and they're never going
to accept me now.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.790
Zoe, angel,

07:02.823 --> 07:04.658
this is Hanukkah.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.827
Hanukkah is a time for miracles.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.061
Oh, no, here she goes.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.797
Look, Nana,

07:09.830 --> 07:11.064
Zoe does not need to hear
your whole spiel.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.065
Hey, hey, no.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.667
I think it is
very important

07:13.701 --> 07:19.006
that we are reminded
of the meaning of Hanukkah.

07:19.039 --> 07:24.478
Hanukkah is a time to expect
the unexpected.

07:25.713 --> 07:30.017
A time for reuniting
 with people who matter.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.552
Brick Breeland.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.087
I was wondering when I was
going to run into you.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.089
Shelby. Hi.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.525
I have huge news.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.959
Huge. Guess.

07:38.992 --> 07:42.229
Uh, wh... I-I don't know.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.965
I bought Fancie's and I'm
turning it into a cabaret.

07:46.734 --> 07:47.801
No words, huh?

07:47.835 --> 07:48.936
You are as adorable and as sexy

07:48.969 --> 07:50.170
as the day you dumped me.
Oh...

07:50.203 --> 07:51.772
Which you were
right to do.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.207
No hard feelings,
I was selfish then.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.577
I'm really working
on myself.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.212
We have got to catch up.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.114
You, me, Harvest Festival,
tomorrow?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.716
Yeah.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.952
Bye!

08:04.985 --> 08:06.987
Ooh.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.990
SYLVIE:
 Hanukkah is a time

08:10.023 --> 08:13.226
for old friends to show up
 when you need them the most.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.195
Yeah, you know,
my tooth healed all on its own,

08:15.228 --> 08:19.867
so you can go ahead and cancel,
uh, that appointment.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.268
(groans softly)

08:21.301 --> 08:23.604
Still scared of
the dentist, you wimp?

08:23.637 --> 08:25.739
Tansy?

08:28.241 --> 08:31.111
Wasn't there something
about the Maccabees

08:31.144 --> 08:32.580
and war?

08:32.613 --> 08:34.582
Sure. All that, too.

08:34.615 --> 08:38.885
But the point is that Hanukkah
is a magical time.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.121
Your family will come around.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.756
Thank you, Sylvie,

08:43.791 --> 08:45.759
but when it comes to the Wilkes

08:45.793 --> 08:48.128
I don't think a miracle's
coming my way.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.296
The Jews thought
the same thing

08:49.329 --> 08:51.865
about the oil in the temple.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.935
Eight days it lasted.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.644
BRICK:
Hello, Zoe.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.012
Don't you look nice?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.213
Patient for you in exam three.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.581
Squirrel bite.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.716
Why can't you take it?

09:08.749 --> 09:10.751
Oh, you're gonna want
this patient.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.052
Why?

09:12.085 --> 09:14.321
It's Brando Wilkes.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.323
(whispers):
Brando Wilkes?

09:16.356 --> 09:17.691
My great uncle?

09:17.725 --> 09:18.959
Or my second cousin?

09:18.992 --> 09:20.127
My relative is here?

09:21.228 --> 09:22.663
(gasps)

09:22.696 --> 09:24.331
Hanukkah miracles do exist.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.967
Thanks.

09:27.968 --> 09:31.304
Yeah. Maybe they do.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.640
(laughs)

09:32.673 --> 09:35.008
(car horn honks)

09:35.042 --> 09:37.110
(seagulls calling)

09:37.144 --> 09:39.246
(birds singing)

09:48.021 --> 09:51.358
Vivian would maim me
if she knew I was here.

09:51.391 --> 09:54.227
Well, luckily the squirrel
beat her to it.

09:54.261 --> 09:58.331
You know, Harley was my brother?

09:58.365 --> 10:02.636
I am horrified to admit
that I didn't realize that.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.706
But you do look a lot like him.

10:05.739 --> 10:09.843
Your father was a great man,
but whoa, terrible card player.

10:09.877 --> 10:12.813
We used to play during
his lunch break.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.115
52 years ago this very day,

10:15.148 --> 10:18.952
I took my winnings over to the
Harvest Festival, met my wife.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.120
Oh, is that why you're
in BlueBell today,

10:20.153 --> 10:21.188
your anniversary?

10:21.221 --> 10:24.191
No, Margaret May died
two years ago last month.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.326
Oh.
Miss her every day.

10:26.359 --> 10:31.231
But I'm keeping myself busy,
taking art classes,

10:31.264 --> 10:33.400
seniors' slow pitch softball,

10:33.433 --> 10:37.938
though Vivian's always
getting on me to be careful.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.340
Well, Vivian may have
a point there.
Mmm.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.744
So, just a tetanus shot
and you're all set.

10:43.777 --> 10:46.146
You're good at this.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.116
Your daddy would've
been proud.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.055
Zoe...

10:56.323 --> 10:57.991
...keep trying.

10:58.025 --> 11:01.294
Vivian and the rest
might come around...

11:01.328 --> 11:03.163
one day.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.166
What if you came around?

11:06.199 --> 11:09.770
Will you have lunch with me
a-and Joel and his grandma?

11:09.803 --> 11:12.039
Please?
(chuckles)

11:12.072 --> 11:14.842
I won't tell Vivian
if you don't.

11:14.875 --> 11:15.976
Mm-mm.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.110
(chuckles)

11:20.080 --> 11:22.983
Okay, pal, your new
appointment is at 3:00.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.818
You just bought yourself
another couple hours,

11:24.852 --> 11:26.419
but I'm gonna be
following you around,

11:26.453 --> 11:28.421
make sure you go to
that dentist. Just...

11:28.455 --> 11:31.158
We need to sit on
this bench for a while.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.425
Why? Are we casing the joint?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.061
(chuckles)
No.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.130
I'm saving up for my own
chair in a beauty shop, so...

11:37.164 --> 11:38.966
Scott, Scooter, you
know, my boyfriend...

11:38.999 --> 11:41.969
McGreevy.
...hooked me up with
an amazing opportunity

11:42.002 --> 11:43.871
to earn some extra cash.

11:43.904 --> 11:47.040
Which is what exactly?

11:47.074 --> 11:49.943
You're about to
see. Hi, there.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.012
Are you Agnes
Butler-Hicket?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.181
Yes, I am. Who are you?

11:54.214 --> 11:57.751
Please don't be mad.
This is for you.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.052
You've, um,
been served.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.421
Guess your husband needs
that divorce.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.090
Maybe it's a blessing.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.926
How dare you?! Who
do you think you are?!

12:05.959 --> 12:08.762
Now, this is none
of your business!

12:08.796 --> 12:09.262
I know. I...

12:09.997 --> 12:11.331
Run!
Oh, yeah.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.966
This is an incredible
opportunity!

12:13.000 --> 12:14.802
Come on, Dolly!
Get out of here!

12:14.835 --> 12:17.104
Run, girl!
You get!

12:18.138 --> 12:19.807
Hi, guys.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.075
I have a
special guest.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.443
Uh, Sylvie,
this is Brando Wilkes.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.845
Brando,

12:24.878 --> 12:26.446
you remember Joel.
Uh, yeah, hi.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.015
Oh, oh, hi. Hi.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.349
SYLVIE:
Wilkes.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.252
Well, I knew someone
in your family would come

12:32.285 --> 12:34.521
to their senses.
Hanukkah,

12:34.554 --> 12:36.156
miracles. Sit.

12:38.025 --> 12:41.394
It is so, so good
to see you, Brando.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.563
Brando, huh?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.465
What a... unusual name.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.835
Oh, my real name
is Vernon.

12:47.868 --> 12:52.539
They call me Brando on account
of my Marlon Brando impressions.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.307
(quietly):
How did this happen?

12:54.341 --> 12:55.943
He came into my office.

12:55.976 --> 13:00.280
I think he's the first
Wilkes to actually like me.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.283
(bad Brando impersonation):
"I'll make you an offer

13:03.316 --> 13:06.153
you can't refuse."

13:06.186 --> 13:08.889
Wow, that is... that is...
That's good.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.490
Don Corleone,

13:10.523 --> 13:12.125
right here
in Alabama.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.426
That is remarkable.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.028
Hey, you both like

13:15.062 --> 13:16.897
The Godfather.
What are the odds?

13:16.930 --> 13:19.299
Hey, do you know that
you both take art classes?

13:19.332 --> 13:20.901
SYLVIE:
Oh, I'm not very good.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.903
Oh, I'm awful.
Oh, well,

13:22.936 --> 13:24.437
it keeps me young.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.573
BRANDO:
You don't
need anything

13:26.606 --> 13:28.308
to keep you young.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.577
(chuckles, mutters)

13:30.610 --> 13:32.980
Uh, what is that?
What is that with the hair?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.547
Flirting.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.884
Grandma Sylvie
is putting

13:36.917 --> 13:39.219
the mack in Maccabees.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.125
(Brando and Sylvie chuckle)

13:47.227 --> 13:50.197
Babs and Edward
came up empty.
(sighs)

13:50.230 --> 13:51.464
So did Frank.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.933
And there's no sugar daddy.

13:52.966 --> 13:53.934
So I guess
this means

13:53.967 --> 13:55.602
it's my daddy's baby.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.338
Yeah, but Brick
is a responsible adult.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.540
I'm sure that he can be
the father to this child

14:00.573 --> 14:02.575
without having to get
back together with Shelby.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.550
Hey. Guess who I ran into.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.120
Well, Lord help us.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.055
What did she have to say?

14:15.088 --> 14:17.424
Oh, she said I was adorable
and handsome as ever.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.625
No, Daddy,

14:18.658 --> 14:19.626
about the baby.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.362
Oh. Well, i-it didn't come up.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.464
But I think we all know the
answer to that question.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.366
I'll verify it tomorrow.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.937
We have a date
for the Harvest Festival.
Uh,

14:29.970 --> 14:32.973
I... think that is
a very bad idea.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.374
After an afternoon with her,

14:34.407 --> 14:36.376
who knows what kind of
promises you'll make.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.444
Why is she here?

14:37.477 --> 14:38.946
Look, look,

14:38.979 --> 14:41.081
I appreciate your concern,
but I'm a grown man,

14:41.114 --> 14:42.950
and I expect
to be treated that way.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.517
So before I
get angry, go.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.186
Get out of here.
Now, go on. Get.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.389
I have a gift to wrap.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.723
Yeah.

14:50.757 --> 14:54.261
(quietly):
You know, if you really want
to get through to him,

14:54.294 --> 14:56.196
you can do the unthinkable.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.265
(groans)

14:58.298 --> 15:01.268
Call Grandma Bettie.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.936
(whimpers)

15:03.971 --> 15:06.206
SYLVIE:
 This is so interesting

15:06.239 --> 15:08.942
seeing this town
through your eyes, Brando.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.944
I mean, there's so much history.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.280
Do you know that Brando
met his dearly departed wife

15:13.313 --> 15:14.647
right in that hay maze?

15:14.681 --> 15:16.549
52 years
we were together.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.286
Well, I was with my Jerry 55.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.121
Oh. I've been lonely
without her,

15:21.154 --> 15:23.656
but, you know, for the first
time in a long while,

15:23.690 --> 15:25.192
I'm not feeling
so lonely.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.561
That is so sweet.
You know what? I think it's
about time to wrap things up.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.563
Uh, Nana, if
we're gonna bake

15:30.597 --> 15:32.299
rugelach tomorrow, we
should go to the store.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.601
Well, you know, actually,
I thought, uh, Brando and I

15:34.634 --> 15:36.703
could take a little walk
and then maybe hit bingo

15:36.736 --> 15:38.671
at the rec center tonight.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.241
That would be divine.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.442
Uh-oh.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.012
"Of all the gin joints
in the world..."

15:45.045 --> 15:47.680
Uh, Vivian, I know what
you must be thinking.
You said you'd be home

15:47.714 --> 15:49.316
three hours ago.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.717
When you didn't show up,
I presumed

15:50.750 --> 15:52.319
you'd been kidnapped.
Oh.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.054
I see now I was right.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.689
It was an amazing coincidence,
actually. After I ran

15:56.723 --> 15:58.525
into you this
morning, Brando came

15:58.558 --> 16:00.393
into my office, and I
invited him to lunch.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.728
I-It was only lunch.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.163
BRANDO:
B-But now I'm staying

16:03.196 --> 16:05.165
for Bingo. I've got a date.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.366
With me.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.601
I am Sylvie Stephens,
Joel's grandmother.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.470
Pleasure to meet

16:10.503 --> 16:12.439
any relative of my Zoe.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.706
Oh, Sylvie,
I'm sure

16:13.740 --> 16:16.143
you're lovely,
but, um, Brando,

16:16.176 --> 16:19.279
did you forget? Loretta June,
her piano recital.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.681
Oh, gosh. That doesn't
even ring a bell.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.017
Uh, must have forgotten.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.352
Zoe.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.653
Joel.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.489
"I'll be back."

16:29.522 --> 16:31.724
His Schwarzenegger
is phenomenal.

16:31.758 --> 16:36.329
Sylvie, I hope
we meet again one day.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.036
VIVIAN:
I can't believe you.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.437
Manipulating the heart
of an old man

16:44.471 --> 16:46.639
just so you can get my family
to accept you?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.508
How selfish can you be?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.110
But I wasn't. This just...

16:50.143 --> 16:52.079
Stay away from us. I mean it.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.114
(sighs)

17:05.125 --> 17:07.260
All right, Wade,
moment of truth.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.396
I can't do it.
I hate the noise.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.531
I hate the music they play
in the waiting rooms.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.099
I hate the-the pain.
(sighs)

17:13.133 --> 17:14.834
I hate the fact they ask you
questions, then expect you

17:14.867 --> 17:17.104
to answer while their hand's
halfway down your throat.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.472
I've been having some trouble
sleeping lately, on account

17:19.506 --> 17:21.540
of the new job,
so the doctor gave me pills.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.242
For anxiety.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.444
Tansy, you do realize a job
which requires you to medicate

17:25.478 --> 17:26.779
probably isn't a good job.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.681
It's the worst. I hate it.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.817
There, I said it.
But it's good money.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.086
And Scott had to pull
a lot of strings.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.053
So quit.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.391
Wade, how many of those
did you just take?

17:38.425 --> 17:39.792
You're only supposed
to take one.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.528
Oh, I did take one.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.430
Plus two for good luck.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.703
So, Bertram's paternity
has been confirmed?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.272
Well, Grandma
Breeland,

17:52.305 --> 17:55.275
not confirmed but
highly suspected.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.845
And this... Shelby,
she's everything I've heard?

17:58.878 --> 18:00.447
LEMON:
Oh,

18:00.480 --> 18:02.715
she's a materialistic,
selfish flake, and Daddy is

18:02.749 --> 18:03.816
a gelatinous pile
of goo around her.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.785
So, they have a
date tomorrow,

18:05.818 --> 18:08.121
Grandma, which is why
we must speak to him tonight.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.123
Put up a united front.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.525
Would it be too much
for you to...

18:12.559 --> 18:14.627
threaten to cut him out
of your will if he sees her?

18:16.496 --> 18:18.698
Consider it handled.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.333
(giggles)

18:20.367 --> 18:22.702
JOEL:
 Lavon, it is so great of you

18:22.735 --> 18:23.736
to let us use your kitchen.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.871
Thank you so much.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.873
Well, it's my first Hanukkah.

18:26.906 --> 18:30.243
And plus Burt Reynolds
loves fried potatoes, so...

18:30.277 --> 18:32.479
Uh...

18:32.512 --> 18:34.681
(quietly):
Um, is she okay?

18:34.714 --> 18:37.317
No. Thanks
to my meddling girlfriend.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.352
What'd you do?

18:39.386 --> 18:41.888
I tried to bring joy
to two seniors in need.

18:41.921 --> 18:45.892
She set Sylvie up
with Brando Wilkes.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.328
You pimped out Joel's nana
to get in with your family?

18:48.361 --> 18:50.330
Look, I wanted to have lunch
with my uncle.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.699
I didn't think that him
and Sylvie were gonna
hit it off like they did.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.167
But I'm glad that they did

18:54.201 --> 18:56.403
because she is lonely
and needs connection.
Hey,

18:56.436 --> 18:58.238
my grandpa only died a year ago.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.772
Sylvie's heart can't take
any more pain.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.940
Who says she's in pain?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.142
Look at her.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.346
She looks sad.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.714
She looks very sad.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.881
Maybe she's happily

19:08.915 --> 19:10.517
remembering
the lunch she had

19:10.550 --> 19:12.285
with a very talented
impressionist.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.522
SYLVIE:
I hope you aren't
arguing about me.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.290
JOEL:
Oh, no. Not at all.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.659
No, we were... we were arguing
about politics.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.527
Mmm.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.462
Health care. I'm pro.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.796
Because I'm a doctor.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.398
Like you wish Joel was.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.799
SYLVIE:
You know, I think

19:26.833 --> 19:27.934
I should give you kids
the night.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.702
We can bake tomorrow.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.572
What? No, no. Nana, come on.
Hang out with us.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.308
We'll make dinner
and, um, see a movie?

19:35.342 --> 19:38.278
Eh, you don't need your old nana
hanging around. Besides,

19:38.311 --> 19:42.582
I had quite a day, and I think
I'm gonna go to senior bingo.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.517
Oh, hey. Uh, I'll walk you out.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.553
Mmm.
Well, bye, Nana.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.425
Okay, fine, she's sad.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.960
I'm sorry.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.595
That's all right.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.730
She'll have fun at senior bingo.
But, hey,

19:57.764 --> 19:59.832
promise me, from now on,

19:59.866 --> 20:02.001
no more gentleman callers.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.404
No. I promise. Of course.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.972
Okay.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.207
(phone chimes)
Oh.

20:09.776 --> 20:13.313
Hmm. Dash threw out
his back rehearsing

20:13.346 --> 20:15.748
for his So You Think You
 Can Dance audition video.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.218
Be back in an hour.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.889
Mother?

20:24.624 --> 20:25.725
What is going on here?

20:25.758 --> 20:26.893
Well, this is...

20:26.926 --> 20:28.595
this is sort of
an intervention.

20:28.628 --> 20:31.331
We know that this Shelby problem
is beyond your control.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.332
BRICK:
Whoa, whoa.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.934
There is no Shelby problem.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.470
And my social life
is my own business.

20:37.504 --> 20:40.407
Bertram, you are a Breeland.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.874
Yet here you are,
flouncing around,

20:41.908 --> 20:45.578
having illegitimate children
like some tacky Wilkes.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.013
Precisely.
So that's the reason

20:47.046 --> 20:49.749
you're gonna do the right thing
by this child.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.718
You're gonna marry that woman.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.619
What?!

20:52.652 --> 20:53.820
Mrs. Breeland...

20:53.853 --> 20:54.987
What is happening?

20:55.021 --> 20:56.623
BRICK:
Well, well.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.892
Well, for the first time
in 50 years,

20:59.926 --> 21:02.695
I agree with you, Mom.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.830
Ha!

21:03.863 --> 21:05.998
(chuckles)

21:07.934 --> 21:11.371
Great. Doing good. Come on.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.374
Sit right down.
Okay.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.608
(chuckles)

21:15.642 --> 21:19.779
Okay, cowboy, one more person
to serve and I'll get you home.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.048
You are so nice to
take care of me.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.851
(chuckles)
Thanks. We'll talk
when you're not hallucinating.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.853
I'm not hallucinating.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.722
I'm seeing the truth.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.591
You are so kind.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.495
You're the best
ex-wife I ever had.

21:35.528 --> 21:38.598
Y-You shouldn't
be a process-erer.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.668
Server-erer.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.803
Procer servicer.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.406
Uh...
I'll be back
in five minutes.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.941
Do not move from this bench.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.877
(chuckles)
Why would I?

21:50.910 --> 21:52.679
I love this bench.

21:52.712 --> 21:57.049
Do you realize that
someone, somewhere,

21:57.083 --> 21:58.951
made this bench?

21:58.985 --> 22:01.854
Okay... Come on, Dolly.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.658
And that light.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.093
It's beautiful.

22:07.126 --> 22:10.430
I just want to walk
into the light.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.801
(crickets chirping softly)

22:14.834 --> 22:16.068
Zoe.
Oh!

22:16.102 --> 22:17.970
Oh, Brando.
What are you doing here?

22:18.004 --> 22:21.841
Loretta June didn't have
a piano recital tonight.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.911
Vivian made it up to drag
me away from your family.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.113
Well, she really, really
doesn't like me, huh?

22:27.146 --> 22:29.682
Well, she's been going
through a hard time lately.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.585
And let's face it, you're
an easy scapegoat.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.722
But she's taking
this all too far.

22:35.755 --> 22:38.791
On behalf of my
family, I apologize.

22:38.825 --> 22:41.494
Thank you.
That means a lot.

22:41.528 --> 22:45.965
But I-I'm not here
solely to atone.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.834
I'm...

22:47.867 --> 22:49.402
I'm looking for Sylvie.

22:49.436 --> 22:52.839
Oh, Brando, I don't think
that's a good idea.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.074
I-I promised Joel.
What you did today,

22:55.107 --> 22:58.611
connecting two lost souls,

22:58.645 --> 23:00.580
well, it's just
like Sylvie said,

23:00.613 --> 23:02.449
a miracle, Zoe.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.820
She's playing bingo
at the rec center.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.456
Oh.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.559
Maybe Hanukah is
Jewish Valentine's Day.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.060
Sure. Why not?

23:14.093 --> 23:16.763
You know, it makes about
as much sense as the dreidel.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.465
(laughs)

23:18.498 --> 23:20.800
*

23:38.785 --> 23:40.086
Wade?

23:43.089 --> 23:44.991
Hey!

23:45.024 --> 23:46.559
I am in the
best mood.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.461
So, my uncle came
into the office today.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.196
He had a squirrel bite,
but that's beside...

23:50.229 --> 23:51.631
You...

23:56.102 --> 23:57.904
There.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.607
*

24:11.851 --> 24:13.853
*
(groans softly)

24:20.860 --> 24:22.929
Oh, wow.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.965
I'm guessing that dream
last night wasn't so much

24:25.998 --> 24:27.800
a dream.

24:27.834 --> 24:32.104
Look... Zoe, I-I was
on Tansy's anxiety meds.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.640
I didn't mean to...

24:33.673 --> 24:34.974
Stop. I don't want
to hear excuses.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.810
I just want you to promise
that it will never,

24:37.844 --> 24:39.178
ever happen again.

24:39.211 --> 24:42.214
I'm with Joel.
I am happy with Joel.
I know.

24:42.248 --> 24:45.985
Okay? And I am...
I'm very sorry.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.854
Would you please
just not tell him?

24:47.887 --> 24:49.856
He's a good guy,
and, you know, he and I

24:49.889 --> 24:51.858
are kind of pals now.
I will never tell him,

24:51.891 --> 24:54.927
because nothing happened.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.062
I get it.

24:56.095 --> 24:59.632
Nothing happened.
Nothing at all.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.069
That's where you
disappeared to last night?

25:03.102 --> 25:04.537
(clicks tongue)
Oh, Wade!

25:04.571 --> 25:07.540
Well, it was the pills, not me.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.676
You told me the pills
made you see the truth.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.744
But that was
the pills talking, too.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.880
You know, they're-they're wily.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.682
Lucky you ran into me
when you did,

25:15.715 --> 25:18.885
'cause you need
a good talking to.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.723
(quiet chuckle)

25:23.756 --> 25:25.758
*

25:40.773 --> 25:42.642
ZOE:
Hey!

25:42.675 --> 25:44.644
Where's Sylvie?
Wha...?
I thought

25:44.677 --> 25:47.279
she was with you--
she was supposed to meet
me here a half hour ago.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.115
Huh. That's weird.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.250
Maybe she slept in.
Sylvie Stephens

25:51.283 --> 25:53.586
has woken up promptly
at 5:30 a.m.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.588
every morning since the
Kennedy Administration.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.089
Look, I'm sure she's fine.
It's BlueBell--

25:57.123 --> 25:59.058
what kind of trouble
could she get into?

25:59.091 --> 26:01.293
Dr. Hart, I just heard
from my cousin Emmy

26:01.327 --> 26:02.662
that Brando
was out all night.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.030
What? Weird!

26:04.063 --> 26:05.865
My family's freakin' out.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.333
He's never disappeared
like this.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.335
Okay, well, I'll head to the
bed-and-breakfast, you check

26:09.368 --> 26:10.336
the rest of the
fair, okay?

26:10.369 --> 26:12.672
Yes, I... and I will...

26:12.705 --> 26:14.707
Vivian, wait up!

26:15.908 --> 26:18.210
Whoa, so Brick
is gonna propose?

26:18.244 --> 26:20.947
Looks like it.
Poor guy. Whew!

26:20.980 --> 26:23.249
Question:
if Shelby's so nutso,

26:23.282 --> 26:24.817
why did you date her?

26:24.851 --> 26:27.219
Well, someone told me
to go sow my wild oats,

26:27.253 --> 26:28.921
so I sowed 'em.
Hey, Daisy.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.857
Don't you smile at me.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.759
And, you, be careful.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.327
Don't tell me--
you dated her, too?

26:35.361 --> 26:38.097
It's a small town. Yeah.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.132
So tiny.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.302
Yeah, I'm sure this is
totally innocent, you know?

26:43.335 --> 26:45.905
Brando and Sylvie
were sweet-- you should
have seen them together.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.707
I don't recall
asking your opinion.

26:47.740 --> 26:48.775
(ringtone plays)
Oh.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.077
Ooh, that's Joel.
Maybe he found them.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.379
Okay. Bad news--

26:53.412 --> 26:55.147
they are not at
the bed-and-breakfast.

26:55.181 --> 26:58.217
But good news-- they did
both sleep there last night.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.219
Okay, maybe
that's also bad news.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.221
My grandfather doesn't need
to get involved

27:02.254 --> 27:04.123
with a woman
who is leaving tomorrow.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.392
You're the one that lied and
made up some fictional recital.

27:06.425 --> 27:09.328
Look, Brando found me--
what was I supposed
to do, ignore him?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.898
Why not? You seemed to be able
to ignore us for two years.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.766
Okay, that hurt a little.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.935
(sighs):
You know...

27:15.968 --> 27:20.072
why don't we just go check
the hay maze, and not speak.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.909
I think the opening
of my cabaret should be
"Come to the Cabaret."

27:22.942 --> 27:24.443
Unless you think
that's too on the nose.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.313
Oh, no, no.
I could do something
contemporary.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.882
SHELBY:
I've been workin'
on my twerkin'. Oh!

27:29.916 --> 27:31.851
Oh! Hey,

27:31.884 --> 27:33.853
I think you can do
whatever you put

27:33.886 --> 27:35.354
your mind to.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.389
You are such a gem,
you know that?

27:37.423 --> 27:40.326
Which is why I want
to share some news.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.795
Well, and-and I am
prepared to hear it.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.397
I'm sure you didn't notice,
since I'm carrying so small,

27:45.431 --> 27:48.100
(whispers):
but... I'm pregnant.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.301
What?

27:49.335 --> 27:51.037
Wow!

27:51.070 --> 27:53.405
Oh, congratulations!

27:53.439 --> 27:55.775
I am positive that having a baby

27:55.808 --> 27:58.044
is gonna make me
such a better person.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.812
Am I glowing?

27:59.846 --> 28:01.247
Positively radiant.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.915
Yeah. And just

28:02.949 --> 28:05.151
out of curiosity...

28:05.184 --> 28:06.853
who's the lucky guy?

28:06.886 --> 28:07.987
Well...

28:08.020 --> 28:09.989
I am sure this is gonna come

28:10.022 --> 28:12.892
as quite a shock, but...

28:14.961 --> 28:16.963
*

28:20.332 --> 28:22.501
Hey!

28:22.534 --> 28:24.503
(soft groan)
You guys should have called.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.305
Vivian's very worried.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.740
(chuckles)

28:27.774 --> 28:29.308
Seriously?
What were you thinking?

28:29.341 --> 28:31.277
Of all the women
in all the world, you had

28:31.310 --> 28:32.845
to find
the nearest relation to her?

28:32.879 --> 28:33.913
Oh, we're not related.

28:33.946 --> 28:35.114
Not yet, dear.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.483
VIVIAN: Is anyone else besides
me gonna take this seriously?

28:37.516 --> 28:40.252
You two are behaving
irresponsibly and recklessly.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.021
Vivian Wilkes,
that is enough.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.423
I know you're going
through something,

28:44.456 --> 28:46.292
and I'm sorry
Charles left,

28:46.325 --> 28:49.261
but you got to stop
taking his betrayal out

28:49.295 --> 28:50.997
on everyone else.

28:54.266 --> 28:55.534
Ooh.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.804
I shouldn't
have said that.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.505
I'll handle this.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.841
You two resume canoodling.

29:01.874 --> 29:02.975
Ah.

29:03.009 --> 29:05.744
Uh, just wait for me
to leave first.

29:13.019 --> 29:15.021
Hey, you wanna bite of...?
You wanna...? No.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.188
Yeah, see, you'll get...

29:16.222 --> 29:18.024
George Tucker,
how cute are you!

29:18.057 --> 29:19.258
Shelby!

29:19.291 --> 29:20.392
Shelby, Lynly.
Lynly, Shelby.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.328
Great, now everyone
has met. Great.

29:22.361 --> 29:25.064
I have heard so,
so much about you.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.866
None of our dirty secrets,
I hope.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.134
Kiddin'.
(laughs)

29:28.167 --> 29:30.837
Lynly, you're adorable.
Love that top.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.972
We'll exchange shopping secrets.
And y'all got to come

29:33.005 --> 29:35.842
to the opening of my cabaret;
it's gonna blow your mind!

29:35.875 --> 29:38.210
So, is there
(clears throat)

29:38.244 --> 29:40.046
any woman today we're
gonna run into

29:40.079 --> 29:41.413
that you haven't dated?

29:41.447 --> 29:43.215
Like that lady there,
selling marmalade

29:43.249 --> 29:45.017
(George chuckles)

29:45.051 --> 29:47.086
Yeah, that's hilarious.
Shut up.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.155
Kiss me.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.891
Ew. No, no, no!

29:51.924 --> 29:53.359
My eyes!
Wow,

29:53.392 --> 29:55.027
Lavon, hi!

29:55.061 --> 29:57.429
This festival
is amazing.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.031
You did a fantastic job.
Yes, you did.

29:59.065 --> 29:59.966
This is the
best one ever.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.902
I cannot wait
to see Danielle Bradbery.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.436
Yeah. It's gonna be great.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.437
Yeah.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.575
Well, I should, uh...

30:09.608 --> 30:11.110
Lavon, hey, hold on.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.912
All right, look,
you and I,

30:12.945 --> 30:15.181
we're friends,
and you and Lynly,

30:15.214 --> 30:18.584
you guys are cousins, and Lynly
and I are good together, so...

30:18.617 --> 30:21.988
All day we've run into
George's ex-girlfriends!

30:22.021 --> 30:23.890
Really? That's how we're
defending this now?

30:23.923 --> 30:26.859
Yes. Because you haven't
given them a second look.

30:26.893 --> 30:29.561
My ex was always looking
over my shoulder,

30:29.595 --> 30:31.597
wondering who was
better out there.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.599
I don't feel that
with George.

30:33.632 --> 30:37.003
He makes me feel safe.
Can't you see that?

30:41.507 --> 30:44.176
(sighs)

30:44.210 --> 30:45.945
(chuckles)

30:47.379 --> 30:50.449
Grandma, you are making
an enormous mistake.

30:50.482 --> 30:53.052
Daddy will not be happy
with Shelby.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.420
Well, of course he won't.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.890
I'm aware that this Shelby

30:57.924 --> 31:00.226
is just a shallow,
money-grabbin' harlot,

31:00.259 --> 31:03.162
but thanks to you
and your hooligan sister,

31:03.195 --> 31:05.965
enough shame has fallen
on this family.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.367
(wry laugh) And marrying
Shelby's gonna help?

31:08.400 --> 31:10.102
Oh, yes.

31:10.136 --> 31:13.439
I'm gonna keep my eye
on this baby.

31:13.472 --> 31:16.375
I intend to see that he
or she is raised right.

31:16.408 --> 31:20.179
Bertram's new child
will not disappoint me.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.081
Third time's the charm.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.116
Grandma!
(giggles)

31:26.953 --> 31:29.255
Daddy, are you okay?

31:29.288 --> 31:32.925
I am not the father.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.961
Shelby was

31:34.994 --> 31:37.596
artificially inseminated.

31:37.629 --> 31:38.464
(gasps)

31:38.497 --> 31:39.465
(laughs)

31:39.498 --> 31:41.633
Is this some kind of joke?

31:42.568 --> 31:44.136
You brought me down here,

31:44.170 --> 31:45.271
filled me with hope

31:45.304 --> 31:46.672
for the first
time in years,

31:46.705 --> 31:48.540
and then just
whisked it away?

31:48.574 --> 31:50.977
Mother, I am so sorry
if you are disappointed

31:51.010 --> 31:52.411
that my ex-girlfriend

31:52.444 --> 31:54.713
is not carrying
my illegitimate love child.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.283
And there is a sentence
I never thought I'd be saying.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.617
LEMON: You know,
it was wrong to call you,

31:58.650 --> 32:00.652
and it won't happen again.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.488
Oh!

32:02.521 --> 32:06.158
Oh, I had such high hopes
for you,

32:06.192 --> 32:08.127
my handsome son,

32:08.160 --> 32:09.996
the doctor.
And you?

32:10.029 --> 32:11.430
I thought I was molding

32:11.463 --> 32:12.965
you in my image.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.967
Where did I go wrong?!

32:15.001 --> 32:18.037
Don't y'all know that I'm up
all night, every night,

32:18.070 --> 32:20.372
worrying sick about
what's gonna happen to you?

32:20.406 --> 32:23.309
Don't you idiots know
that I love you?!

32:23.342 --> 32:26.578
Oh! (crying)

32:26.612 --> 32:28.447
(thudding, Lemon gasps)

32:28.480 --> 32:30.249
(Bettie screaming, Lemon gasps)

32:30.282 --> 32:32.051
Mother?!
(gasps)

32:32.084 --> 32:34.653
You know who's single?

32:34.686 --> 32:37.023
Thelma Price.
You should date her.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.190
The librarian?

32:38.224 --> 32:39.425
Hell, no. She
hates my guts.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.594
And, besides, my dance card
is very, very full right now.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.331
Full of airheads!
Hmm.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.632
I'm worried about you, Wade.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.534
You're not taking care
of yourself.

32:48.567 --> 32:49.768
What you talking about?

32:49.801 --> 32:52.104
Rammer Jammer's solid,
run a place on my own.

32:52.138 --> 32:53.672
I even took up fly fishing.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.207
But you haven't been
going to the dentist.

32:55.241 --> 32:57.276
A lot of people have fears
about the dentist, okay?

32:57.309 --> 32:58.277
Look it up.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.579
But you know what people
with healthy teeth have?

33:00.612 --> 33:03.415
Someone in their life
making them go to the dentist.

33:03.449 --> 33:04.616
I'll make you a deal.

33:04.650 --> 33:08.587
I will start looking for a
better class of women to date

33:08.620 --> 33:10.622
if you quit that
job of yours.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.158
It's dangerous,
and it sucks.

33:12.191 --> 33:15.427
I need the money, Wade.
Work here.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.329
You know, it'll take longer
to save up for that chair,

33:17.363 --> 33:20.732
but you'll get whacked
with far fewer umbrellas.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.169
Yeah, but I don't mind
having you around.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.137
Deal.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.306
You can start
by calling the librarian.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.707
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.410
You can start by, uh,
wiping down table nine.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.115
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

33:36.148 --> 33:38.184
Hey, BlueBell.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.651
It's a pleasure to be here.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.653
(applause and cheering)

33:41.687 --> 33:43.689
(band plays upbeat
country intro)

33:52.298 --> 33:57.403
* She had a dead-end job
at The National Bank *

33:57.436 --> 33:59.671
* And a deadbeat husband

33:59.705 --> 34:01.273
Hey.

34:01.307 --> 34:02.408
* Who always drank

34:02.441 --> 34:04.510
Are you okay?

34:04.543 --> 34:06.478
* So when he didn't
come home... *

34:06.512 --> 34:09.547
Brenda was right. I'm
treating him like a child.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.550
And do you know
why? It's because

34:11.583 --> 34:14.253
I don't have my own
child this weekend.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.788
My son, Harley--
he is with his father

34:16.822 --> 34:18.790
for the first time
since we separated.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.292
Oh, wow. That must be hard.

34:20.326 --> 34:21.860
It's awful.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.830
But I'm... I'm sorry.

34:24.862 --> 34:27.433
I'm-I'm taking
it out on you.

34:27.466 --> 34:28.833
Oh, no, you do not have
to be sorry.

34:28.867 --> 34:31.536
You have every right
to be angry with me.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.440
We were so excited to meet
Big Harley's actual daughter.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.842
Why didn't you
want to meet us?
I just...
You know,

34:36.875 --> 34:39.277
family has never meant more
to me than trouble.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.313
But that's no excuse.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.581
I wish we could start over.

34:43.614 --> 34:46.318
Well, as my couples
therapist once said,

34:46.351 --> 34:49.554
"Starting over is difficult,
and that'll be 150 bucks."

34:49.588 --> 34:50.856
Oh, nice.
(laughter)

34:50.889 --> 34:54.760
Well, so was keeping
the temple lit for eight days.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.864
It's a Hanukkah
reference.
Hmm.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.200
Hey, maybe, you know,

35:01.233 --> 35:03.335
you'd reconsider
coming to dinner tonight?

35:03.369 --> 35:07.139
Okay. Yeah. Maybe.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.309
Uh, the mayor's house!

35:10.342 --> 35:11.477
7:00.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.579
We will provide the dreidels.

35:13.612 --> 35:18.750
* Nobody knew
she was brave like that *

35:18.784 --> 35:21.887
* And she went driving

35:21.920 --> 35:26.192
* So far away
nobody's gonna find her *

35:26.225 --> 35:32.564
* Flying just fast enough
to leave it all behind her *

35:32.598 --> 35:35.434
* But she didn't know
till she hit the road *

35:35.467 --> 35:38.770
* Deep in her soul

35:38.804 --> 35:41.507
* She's got the fire
and the fight of a gypsy *

35:41.540 --> 35:48.380
* Ain't nothing stronger
than the heart of Dixie *

35:48.414 --> 35:52.384
* The heart of Dixie...

35:52.418 --> 35:54.386
Vivian Wilkes.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.455
Wade Kinsella.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.457
You remember me?

35:58.490 --> 35:59.625
Yeah, of course I do.

35:59.658 --> 36:00.826
You were the smartest girl
at Lillian.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.862
You know, used to kick our asses
in those, uh, debate things.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.632
And I remember you could skate
backwards at the roller rink.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.234
Oh.
Hey.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.668
You got your braces off.
Congratulations.

36:09.701 --> 36:10.902
You're sweet.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.404
I hear you bought
the Rammer Jammer.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.406
Yeah. Hey, you should
come by some time.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.641
Yeah. Maybe.

36:15.674 --> 36:16.942
I got to go.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.810
It was nice running
into you, though.

36:18.844 --> 36:19.945
Yeah, you, too.

36:19.978 --> 36:22.914
* Oh, oh-oh, oh.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.350
(laughs)

36:24.383 --> 36:26.952
(song ends,
applause and cheering)

36:34.460 --> 36:36.428
A broken hip.

36:36.462 --> 36:37.829
It is not good.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.431
And it's all our fault.

36:39.465 --> 36:40.699
It is.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.701
And it's going
to take months to heal.

36:42.734 --> 36:45.837
And she can't be all alone
in that big old house of hers.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.239
It's true.

36:47.273 --> 36:48.874
Yeah, we should
definitely hire a nurse.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.276
We're not hiring a nurse.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.977
We did it,
and one of us needs

36:52.010 --> 36:53.912
to go down there
and take care of her.

36:53.945 --> 36:56.515
Well, good-bye, Daddy.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.417
I'll miss you.

36:58.450 --> 36:59.618
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

36:59.651 --> 37:02.388
Mother would never have been
here had you not dragged her

37:02.421 --> 37:03.855
to interfere
in my personal life.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.691
Well, my youth is at stake!

37:05.724 --> 37:07.526
Well, my livelihood is at stake.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.827
BOTH:
You have to do it!

37:08.860 --> 37:10.862
Over my dead body!

37:12.298 --> 37:15.033
All right, we will settle this
like mature adults.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.336
Flip a coin?

37:17.369 --> 37:18.437
Yeah, agree.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.871
All right.

37:19.905 --> 37:22.274
Heads.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.744
Oh.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.813
Bye-bye, baby.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.282
I'm gonna miss you.

37:30.316 --> 37:32.951
Oh.

37:32.984 --> 37:35.020
(scoffs)

37:35.887 --> 37:38.424
Mmm. Hey, don't burn your arm.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.025
Thank you, Nana.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.993
Whoa. That's a lot
of latkes.
LAVON:
Oh.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.695
Why can't
we have these every day?

37:43.729 --> 37:45.564
Because then
it wouldn't
be special.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.366
Well, yeah, and you'd
be a thousand pounds.

37:47.399 --> 37:48.734
Oh.
ZOE:
Well,

37:48.767 --> 37:50.469
you will have leftovers
for a week

37:50.502 --> 37:51.703
if the Wilkes don't show.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.038
SYLVIE:
Honey, as the
Torah says,

37:53.071 --> 37:55.641
if you make it,
they will come.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.709
I think that's
from a baseball movie.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.478
I'm beginning to think

37:59.511 --> 38:01.747
that Sylvie knows as much
about Hanukkah as I do.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.782
Hey, who cares
if they don't show?

38:03.815 --> 38:05.917
We're gonna have
a great night, hmm?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.753
Shalom.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.590
Hi.
Is that right?

38:11.623 --> 38:13.792
(laughs)
That was perfect.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.026
JOEL:
Thanks for coming, everybody.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.363
(overlapping chatter)

38:17.396 --> 38:19.465
MAN:
Smells good.

38:23.101 --> 38:26.304
*

38:31.810 --> 38:33.779
Twice in one day, huh?

38:33.812 --> 38:36.415
What are the
chances of that?

38:36.448 --> 38:37.549
It is a coincidence.

38:37.583 --> 38:38.950
What are you doing here?

38:38.984 --> 38:41.653
Well, I'm, I'm
the neighbor.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.823
Well, neighbor,
Happy Hanukkah.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.360
Yeah... yeah.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.566
*

38:54.600 --> 38:58.437
Baruch ata adonai,

38:58.470 --> 39:02.107
eloheynu,
 melech...

39:02.140 --> 39:05.343
*

39:08.714 --> 39:11.082
Oh-- aw.
Ah, yes.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.421
That's what you're wearing
to Hanukkah dinner?

39:21.860 --> 39:24.863
*

39:27.533 --> 39:29.735
I'm sorry I got all weird
about protecting Sylvie.

39:29.768 --> 39:30.902
You were right.

39:30.936 --> 39:34.906
Oh, no, you were just being
protective of your family.

39:34.940 --> 39:38.043
Now that I finally have a
family of my own, I get it.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.645
(chuckles)

39:39.678 --> 39:41.613
Mmm.

39:41.647 --> 39:42.781
Look at Sylvie blushing.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.451
I haven't seen her
that happy since we went

39:45.484 --> 39:46.752
to the bookstore and
I showed her my novel

39:46.785 --> 39:47.919
on the shelf.
That's sweet.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.588
Well, she was there
to buy me

39:49.621 --> 39:51.490
an MCAT test prep book, but yes.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.893
We're family.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.062
We pull for each other.

39:57.095 --> 40:00.098
*

40:01.667 --> 40:03.669
(children clamoring)

40:11.843 --> 40:13.812
Thanks for giving me
and George a chance.

40:13.845 --> 40:14.913
Oh, yeah, of course.

40:14.946 --> 40:18.049
I just want you
to be happy.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.518
So, does he
make you happy?

40:19.551 --> 40:20.519
He does.

40:20.552 --> 40:21.820
I trust him, Lavon.

40:21.853 --> 40:24.089
Hey, you should call him,
invite him to dinner.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.525
I already did, but he's
prepping for court tomorrow,

40:26.558 --> 40:28.193
has to work late.
Said he's just going

40:28.226 --> 40:29.895
to pick up
some takeout.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.931
Thank you so much, Chester.

40:34.966 --> 40:38.069
Tansy, hey, uh, what...

40:38.103 --> 40:40.071
what are you doing here?

40:40.105 --> 40:41.540
Wade offered me a job.

40:41.573 --> 40:44.109
Hope it's not going
to be uncomfortable.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.646
No, no, why,
why would it be?

40:47.679 --> 40:48.680
No, not at all.

40:49.615 --> 40:50.849
(clears throat)

40:55.020 --> 40:57.989
*

40:58.023 --> 40:59.858
Thanks for an amazing time.

40:59.891 --> 41:00.759
Oh, sure.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.661
Are you going to go
home with Brando?

41:02.694 --> 41:04.796
I'm gonna let him stay
a little longer.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.965
Hmm, right. Well, Joel can
give you a ride you home.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.700
Actually I have a ride.

41:08.734 --> 41:09.501
Oh, okay.

41:09.535 --> 41:12.871
Hey, Vivian, you,
uh, you ready?
