Universe-- get out!

You're right.
I do love Bowie.

But we're not
getting back together.

02:36.580 --> 02:37.830
Why not?

02:37.830 --> 02:40.620
Bowie's not someone
who puts down roots.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.920
Bowie:
A ring?

02:41.920 --> 02:44.330
Both:
The Universe!

02:50.540 --> 02:52.670
Glow-in-the-dark duct tape.

02:52.670 --> 02:56.710
We use this to spell out
"Will you marry me" on the roof
of Andishack,

02:56.710 --> 02:58.620
and when Bex looks out
her bedroom window--

02:58.620 --> 03:00.830
Which I'm standing under,
playing the guitar--

03:00.830 --> 03:03.120
-Ahhh! I'm loving this!
-Me, too.

03:04.210 --> 03:08.580
But... you have
to do it tonight.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.670
As in right now?

03:10.670 --> 03:12.620
We're moving back
to the apartment tomorrow.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.670
CeCe and Pops
are coming home.

03:14.670 --> 03:16.080
I can't propose tonight.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.250
Yes, you can.

03:18.250 --> 03:22.460
You have the guitar,
the duct tape, the ring...

03:22.460 --> 03:23.880
What else do you need?

03:23.880 --> 03:26.290
Besides a shower?

03:26.290 --> 03:29.960
-Real nice.
-Sorry, but... you smell
like the grease-mobile.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.620
-Mm-hm.
-(both laugh)

03:32.620 --> 03:33.960
What else do you have?

03:33.960 --> 03:37.120
Okay, so, remember
how you said plants
could talk?

03:37.120 --> 03:38.330
Yeah?

03:38.330 --> 03:40.920
We hide this
in one of the ferns.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.790
And when Bex
is watering the plants,

03:44.790 --> 03:46.380
(distorted radio sound)
"Will you marry me?"

03:46.380 --> 03:48.580
(laughing)

03:48.580 --> 03:50.710
It just needs
some new batteries.

03:50.710 --> 03:53.580
Maybe we should
ask the universe
for an idea.

03:53.580 --> 03:54.620
Come on.

03:58.750 --> 03:59.790
Universe!

03:59.790 --> 04:01.290
You got anything?

04:02.330 --> 04:03.750
(with small voice)
Talking plant.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.580
Did you hear that?

04:08.210 --> 04:10.290
Nice try.

04:10.290 --> 04:12.210
Wha-- It wasn't me.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.620
Okay.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.120

So, I thought we could
have an airplane fly by

05:10.710 --> 05:12.620
and they'd spell out
"Will you marry me",

05:12.620 --> 05:14.830
and then when she looks out
of her window,

05:14.830 --> 05:16.330
Bowie's down there
playing his song

05:16.330 --> 05:17.460
and there's candles,

05:17.460 --> 05:18.620
'cause he loves candles.

05:18.620 --> 05:20.830
But, he said he
couldn't do it last night.

05:20.830 --> 05:24.580
You can't blame him.
A proposal isn't something
you rush.

05:24.580 --> 05:26.290
They're my mom and dad.

05:26.290 --> 05:28.330
And they thought they'd never
see each other again,

05:28.330 --> 05:30.540
but now we're all together.

05:30.540 --> 05:33.420
And I really want them
to get married.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.620
You'd be the maid of honor!

05:34.620 --> 05:37.080
I didn't even think of that!

05:37.080 --> 05:40.000
Oh, and Renaissance Boys
could play at their wedding!

05:40.000 --> 05:41.790
I didn't think of that, either!

05:41.790 --> 05:43.540
Oh, and it'd be so beautiful

05:43.540 --> 05:45.710
if you did it
at the Shadyside
Park Greenhouse.

05:45.710 --> 05:47.380
That's perfect!

05:47.380 --> 05:49.330
Bowie loves plants!

05:49.330 --> 05:52.830
I think we just witnessed
the birth of an event planner.

05:52.830 --> 05:55.750
Seriously, I want
all of what you just said.

05:58.170 --> 06:00.620
She's here.
You two, no fooling around.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.750
Be on your best behavior.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.460
Of course.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.880
-Both:
Ehhhhh!
-(both laughing)

06:06.880 --> 06:12.500
Guys, uh... I'd like you
to meet my... Iris.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.580
-Hi.
-You can say girlfriend, silly.

06:15.580 --> 06:17.210
I can say girlfriend, silly!

06:18.790 --> 06:20.250
Baby tater?

06:20.250 --> 06:21.540
Thanks.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.880
You're in high school, right?

06:25.880 --> 06:27.580
Uh-huh.

06:27.580 --> 06:31.540
We're in seventh grade.
You don't have to be nervous
around us.

06:31.540 --> 06:33.750
I'm nervous around everyone.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.830
Except Cyrus.
(giggles)

06:38.170 --> 06:42.170
You seem so sweet.
I can't believe you're
a friend of Amber's.

06:42.170 --> 06:45.420
Amber's not that bad.
She's actually very insecure.

06:45.420 --> 06:47.580
Why do people keep saying that?

06:47.580 --> 06:50.580
In what way
is Amber insecure?

06:50.580 --> 06:55.120
She needs to have a boyfriend.
It's like she doesn't exist
without one.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.620
Well, lucky for her
she has no trouble
finding them.

06:58.620 --> 07:00.750
She has trouble keeping them.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.710
Jonah broke up
with her yesterday.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.880
They're probably
back together by now.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.920
They're not.
Remember that teddy bear
Jonah won for her

07:11.920 --> 07:13.790
that day at the carnival?

07:13.790 --> 07:14.960
She stabbed him
with her scissors

07:14.960 --> 07:17.540
and ripped out
all his stuffing.

07:17.540 --> 07:21.080
(quietly)
Maybe Amber is insecure.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.710
And demented.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.830
(both laugh)

07:23.830 --> 07:26.420
Dinosaur Cyrus with an I
is alive and well.

07:26.420 --> 07:28.880
Maybe I can visit him sometime.
(giggles)

07:28.880 --> 07:31.960
Certainly. He'd
be delighted to see you.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.790
What are you two crazy kids
doing today?

07:34.790 --> 07:36.830
Now I've got dinosaurs
on my brain.

07:36.830 --> 07:38.710
Natural History Museum,
what do you say?

07:38.710 --> 07:41.170
I'd say I'm T. Rex-cited.

07:41.170 --> 07:45.040
-Then let's
Diplodocus rock this!
-(Iris giggles)

07:46.540 --> 07:49.040
Diplodocus
is a dinosaur.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.500
We know.

07:51.790 --> 07:53.960
Did you know?

07:53.960 --> 07:55.120
Of course not.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.620
(both laughing)

08:00.880 --> 08:03.880
Well, everything seems
to be here.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.920
They cleaned up, that was nice.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.670
I'm sure they forgot
to bring in the mail, just--

08:08.670 --> 08:10.500
Nope, here it is.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.790
Well, would you look at that?
They went shopping.

08:15.790 --> 08:20.330
Huh. I told you
that we could trust them.

08:20.330 --> 08:23.540
Someone has been handling
my plants.

08:23.540 --> 08:27.460
This is not
my potting soil, Rebecca!

08:28.960 --> 08:31.290
Oh, hey.
It's the big Macks.

08:31.290 --> 08:32.380
Hey...

08:33.460 --> 08:34.580
I thought you left.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.960
I did, but, um...

08:36.960 --> 08:38.420
Where's my daughter?

08:39.920 --> 08:42.040
Right here.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.920
Did you re-pot my plants?

08:43.920 --> 08:45.460
No.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.380
I did.

08:47.380 --> 08:48.540
You did?

08:48.540 --> 08:51.330
Ooh... let's move out
of her line of sight.

08:51.330 --> 08:54.080
You can't use commercial
fertilizer, Mrs. M.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.040
They're made of chemicals,
you know?

08:56.040 --> 08:58.120
So I whipped up some compost!

08:58.120 --> 08:59.920
Look how happy they are!

08:59.920 --> 09:01.880
They love their new dirt!

09:01.880 --> 09:05.250
-I think she's going down.
-It's not over.
She'll get a second wind.

09:05.250 --> 09:08.580
Also... I moved around
some of your plants.

09:08.580 --> 09:10.000
Y--

09:10.000 --> 09:10.960
Ohhh...

09:12.380 --> 09:15.000
This little lady wasn't
getting enough sunlight.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.210
My African violet?

09:17.210 --> 09:18.830
Aw, she'll be fine.

09:18.830 --> 09:20.880
Here, let me make you
Oolong tea.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.460
It's in the cupboard
next to the fridge.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.210
Hm.

09:27.210 --> 09:30.500
They're making tea
and talking plants?

09:30.500 --> 09:33.210
It's the most boring miracle
I've ever seen.

09:33.210 --> 09:34.790
(chuckles)

09:38.000 --> 09:41.960
That was so much fun.
Thank you for my stegosaurus.

09:41.960 --> 09:45.080
Heh. It's our thing.
We give each other dinosaurs.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.880
I love that we have
a mash-up name and a thing.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.250
My favorite part of any museum
is the gift shop.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.880
They're so much better
than zoo gift shops.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.580
Ohh, the only thing worse
than a zoo gift shop
is a zoo cafeteria.

10:00.580 --> 10:02.580
Uch, so gross.

10:02.580 --> 10:04.960
You know who has
the best gift shops, though?

10:04.960 --> 10:06.500
Both:
Aquariums!

10:06.500 --> 10:09.960
(both laughing)

10:09.960 --> 10:13.330
This is crazy!
It-- It's not like
you're reading my mind,

10:13.330 --> 10:15.790
it's like you have my mind!

10:15.790 --> 10:18.710
Well, that's a compliment,
because I think you're
very smart.

10:18.710 --> 10:22.960
If we're giving out compliments,
I think you're very cute.
And sweet. And cute,

10:22.960 --> 10:24.250
I already said cute.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.960
Cyrus, shhh.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.210
Okay.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.710
What's happening?

10:32.710 --> 10:35.380
I should know.
But, I don't,
and I could guess,

10:35.380 --> 10:36.920
and, if I had to guess--

10:40.210 --> 10:42.540
Bye, Cyrus.

10:42.540 --> 10:45.960
That was, what I was gonna--
Bye, Iris.

10:57.170 --> 10:59.500
Wooo!

10:59.500 --> 11:03.750
-Come on, Cyrus!
-Tell us already!
What's your big news?

11:03.750 --> 11:06.670
I had my first kiss!

11:06.670 --> 11:08.960
-You did?
-With Iris?

11:08.960 --> 11:10.460
What was it like?

11:10.460 --> 11:12.380
I can't remember.
It's all kind of a blur.

11:12.380 --> 11:16.170
But the important thing is,
it happened! Tell everyone!

11:16.170 --> 11:18.120
-Hey, guys!
-Hey, Jonah!

11:18.120 --> 11:20.460
How was your weekend?
Mine was spectacular!

11:20.460 --> 11:22.670
I kissed Iris!

11:22.670 --> 11:24.460
Oh! Cool!

11:24.460 --> 11:28.670
So listen, the Ultimate team's
having its end-of-the-season
pizza party tonight.

11:28.670 --> 11:31.080
And I would love
for you guys to come.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.960
You have to be there.
You're the reason we won
any of our games.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.830
Oh, p'shh!
I wouldn't miss it.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.250
Just like I didn't
miss any games!

11:39.250 --> 11:40.380
Oww!

11:44.120 --> 11:45.710
I'm not on the team.

11:45.710 --> 11:48.040
That's okay.
You don't have
to be on the team.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.330
We can bring friends.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.000
Then, yeah.
It sounds like fun.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.710
It was really nice of you
to invite me.

11:56.710 --> 11:59.210
Because he didn't have to.

11:59.210 --> 12:00.960
I... don't know.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.830
(whispering)
Don't be an idiot!

12:04.830 --> 12:07.330
-Come on. We have to go.
-Why?

12:07.330 --> 12:09.710
Because I said so!

12:09.710 --> 12:10.830
Pooh.

12:12.710 --> 12:14.920
Don't say no,
just think about it.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.580
Show up if you want to.

12:16.580 --> 12:18.120
Not because I want you to.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.210
Okay.

12:22.210 --> 12:23.670
I'll think about it.

12:23.670 --> 12:25.790
Oh, and,
I have something
for you.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.250
You do?

12:27.250 --> 12:29.460
It's yours.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.000
I don't deserve it.

12:55.580 --> 12:58.710
Oh... you know
what we forgot?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.670
The lamp you made
out of my CDs!

13:02.670 --> 13:06.080
Ugh! Remind me next time!

13:09.380 --> 13:11.080

♪ ♪

13:18.170 --> 13:20.120

13:23.000 --> 13:24.250
What bracelet?

13:25.460 --> 13:28.330
That I made for Jonah.

13:28.330 --> 13:30.460
That he gave to Amber.

13:30.460 --> 13:33.170
That he just gave back to me.

13:33.170 --> 13:34.540
Why?

13:34.540 --> 13:36.580
He said he doesn't deserve it.

13:38.330 --> 13:42.920
Uh-huh. And did he have
a look on his face like this?

13:47.330 --> 13:48.960
How did you know?

13:48.960 --> 13:52.210
Because he likes you!

13:52.210 --> 13:55.580
I don't know why
you keep saying that,
he never has.

13:55.580 --> 13:57.210
Well, he's about to.

13:57.210 --> 13:59.880
He just needs the right place
and the right time.

14:01.120 --> 14:04.620
There's a Space Otters
team party tonight.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.620
He asked me to come.

14:06.620 --> 14:09.250
What are you wearing
to the ball, Cinderella?

14:09.250 --> 14:12.380
Stop.
I haven't decided
if I'm going.

14:12.380 --> 14:13.880
Why wouldn't you go?

14:13.880 --> 14:18.750
Because when Jonah's
in my head, he takes up
a lot of space.

14:19.790 --> 14:22.460
And I just got rid of him.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.210
Or, I thought I did.

14:24.210 --> 14:26.710
Do you want to go
to this party?

14:26.710 --> 14:29.620
I don't know.
My brain feels
like a seesaw.

14:29.620 --> 14:33.250
Yes! No! Yes!

14:33.250 --> 14:36.710
No! Universe! Help me!

14:36.710 --> 14:40.790
You don't need the universe.
All you need is this.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.830
It works, I promise you.

14:44.830 --> 14:48.170
Ask the coin the question.

14:48.170 --> 14:51.250
Should I go
to the Frisbee team
party tonight?

14:51.250 --> 14:53.000
Heads it's yes,
tails it's no.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.210
Ready?

14:59.210 --> 15:01.210
Tails.

15:01.210 --> 15:03.040
There's your answer.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.290
You're goin' to the party.

15:05.290 --> 15:07.170
It came up tails.

15:07.170 --> 15:09.750
You don't listen
to the coin, dodo.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.500
You listen to yourself.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.750
You didn't get the answer
you wanted.

15:13.750 --> 15:17.290
Which means, you already
had the answer.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.880
What am I going to wear?

15:25.330 --> 15:27.620
I don't have all night.
Chop chop!

15:27.620 --> 15:29.330
Huh!

15:29.330 --> 15:32.080
(applause)

15:37.330 --> 15:40.290
(cheering)

15:40.290 --> 15:42.830
Hey! I'm glad
you decided to come.

15:42.830 --> 15:46.080
And wear that dress.
You look amazing!

15:46.080 --> 15:47.580
(laughs)
Thanks, but...

15:47.580 --> 15:49.330
nothing's going to happen.

15:49.330 --> 15:51.500
He's still Jonah Beck.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.790
True. But you're Andi Mack.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.080
Okay, everyone, okay.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.710
Guys, shh.
Jonah's speaking.

15:58.710 --> 16:02.670
In Ultimate, we don't like
to call someone the best.

16:02.670 --> 16:06.040
We don't keep statistics
or rank our players.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.540
Every one of us is a star.

16:08.540 --> 16:12.380
But there is one person
who truly stands out

16:12.380 --> 16:15.460
as the Space Otters' MVP!

16:15.460 --> 16:18.250
-It's you.
-Definitely you.

16:18.250 --> 16:20.080
Cyrus Goodman!

16:20.080 --> 16:21.290
-(applause)
-It's me?

16:21.290 --> 16:22.750
-Go!
-Get up there!

16:22.750 --> 16:27.920
-(applause)
-Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus!

16:27.920 --> 16:30.920
Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus!

16:30.920 --> 16:33.170
Cyrus, I hope you don't mind.

16:33.170 --> 16:35.380
We didn't get you a trophy.

16:35.380 --> 16:37.380
Oh. I wasn't expecting one.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.080
We got this instead!

16:41.080 --> 16:43.620
A Space Otters jersey?

16:43.620 --> 16:45.080
For me?

16:48.250 --> 16:49.960
Thank you, Jonah.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.330
Thank you, Cyrus.

16:58.460 --> 17:00.620
So where to now,
Jonah Jonah Babona?

17:00.620 --> 17:05.420
Is there a, uh,
Space Otters party
after-partaay?

17:07.040 --> 17:09.460
Actually, I was hoping
I could talk to Andi.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.170
Alone?

17:13.170 --> 17:15.540
-Yes. Bye.
-Bye.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.920
-Come on!
-Mhmmm...

17:23.750 --> 17:26.120
I broke up with Amber.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.710
I figured when you gave me
the bracelet.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.170
Sorry I ever let her have it.

17:32.170 --> 17:34.460
How did you get it back?

17:34.460 --> 17:37.330
-I cut off her arm.
-(laughs)

17:39.000 --> 17:41.330
She thought I broke up
with her because of you.

17:41.330 --> 17:45.120
It's crazy that she would ever
be jealous of me.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.460
I don't think it's crazy.

17:50.580 --> 17:51.750
What?

17:53.880 --> 17:57.500
Andi, I like being around you
more than anyone else.

17:57.500 --> 18:01.750
-Oh.
-So I was wondering...

18:01.750 --> 18:04.790
maybe you could think about
being around me.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.620
They remind me
of that picture
of the two elephants

18:08.620 --> 18:10.580
making a heart
with their trunks.

18:11.580 --> 18:13.210
She's giving him
the bracelet!

18:13.210 --> 18:18.040
-She's giving him the bracelet!
-My eardrums! My eardrums!

18:18.040 --> 18:21.750
This... belongs to you.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.500
I'm really happy to have this.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.000
I'm really happy, too.

18:33.790 --> 18:36.580
I wish I could text her
and tell her what's going on
with her right now,

18:36.580 --> 18:39.170
because she wouldn't
even believe it!

18:39.170 --> 18:42.290
Aren't you
so insanely happy
for Andi?

18:42.290 --> 18:45.330
Yeah. So insanely happy.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.620
Bowie, you got a job?

18:54.620 --> 18:57.830
Actually, Celia got it for me.

18:57.830 --> 18:59.420
Jaw, dropped.

18:59.420 --> 19:01.460
-What?
-At a nursery.

19:01.460 --> 19:03.960
For plants, not kids.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.750
Had to promise to get her
the family discount.

19:05.750 --> 19:08.080
-Bowie!
-What?

19:08.080 --> 19:11.540
The woman
who once hated you
now adores you!

19:11.540 --> 19:15.580
You have a job,
which clearly means
you're sticking around...

19:15.580 --> 19:17.000
and you have a ring.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.080
Dude!
What are you waiting for?

19:20.080 --> 19:24.580
I don't know.
I've got this...
knot in my stomach.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.460
I don't know
how she feels about me.

19:28.670 --> 19:31.120
What if she says no?

19:31.120 --> 19:33.500
She's not gonna say no.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.580
You just have to ask her.

19:37.580 --> 19:39.210
Universe? What do you think?

19:39.210 --> 19:41.080
You don't need the universe.

19:42.170 --> 19:43.790
I have something better.

20:01.250 --> 20:02.460
Hey.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.500
Are you okay?

20:07.670 --> 20:10.580
Did you already
order the baby taters?

20:10.580 --> 20:12.620
I don't want any baby taters.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.920
You're scaring me.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.920
I'm scaring me, too.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.120
What is it?

20:22.580 --> 20:26.960
Last night, when we were
watching Andi and Jonah...

20:29.080 --> 20:32.000
you asked me,
am I happy for Andi.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.880
Yeah?

20:33.880 --> 20:36.580
And I said, yes,
I'm happy for Andi.

20:41.330 --> 20:43.420
But I'm also not happy.

20:44.580 --> 20:46.120
How come?

20:49.040 --> 20:51.000
Are you jealous?

20:54.710 --> 20:57.290
Cyrus... do you like Andi?

21:02.580 --> 21:04.620
You like Jonah.

21:14.710 --> 21:18.120
Buffy, I-- I feel weird.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.880
Different.

21:24.420 --> 21:28.750
Cyrus...
you've always
been weird.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.710
But you're no different.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.620
I'm glad I told you.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.670
Me, too.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.250
But the thought
of telling anyone else--

21:44.250 --> 21:46.670
It'll be okay.

21:46.670 --> 21:48.290
I promise.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.380
This is really bad timing.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.210
I just got a girlfriend.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.670
So when are you gonna tell me
what happened at the party?

22:27.210 --> 22:30.000
-Yeah.

24:45.790 --> 24:48.040
Will you marry me?

24:54.120 --> 24:55.830
Mom!

24:56.880 --> 24:58.210
Say yes!

25:05.000 --> 25:06.750
Say something!

25:08.790 --> 25:12.790
♪ ♪

25:17.790 --> 25:18.790
Um...

25:19.880 --> 25:21.250
Andi:
Um?

25:22.620 --> 25:23.710
Buffy/Cyrus:
Um?

25:23.710 --> 25:25.040
I know, right?

25:25.040 --> 25:26.790
What does that mean?

25:26.790 --> 25:27.880
Um.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.330
-It means yes.
-It means no.

25:29.330 --> 25:33.460
Or yes.
Um means different things
to different people.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.290
Depending on
how passive aggressive
your mom is.

25:35.290 --> 25:37.210
You should have seen Bex.

25:37.210 --> 25:40.290
She was shook,
it was so cute, like...

25:40.290 --> 25:42.170
Wait, so are they engaged?

25:42.170 --> 25:45.170
Basically, she just needs
a minute to get her mind
around it.

25:45.170 --> 25:49.920
Andi, that's so exciting.
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.540
-Clap.
-That's not how
I was raised.

25:52.540 --> 25:54.880
I don't celebrate something
before it's happened.

25:54.880 --> 25:59.250
You know what they say,
it's bad luck to sell the skin
before you've got the bear.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.170
Are we talking
about your mother again?

26:01.170 --> 26:03.210
Yes! Sorry.

26:03.210 --> 26:07.120
(sigh)
It gets worse.
My stepmother is my therapist.

26:07.120 --> 26:11.210
Cyrus Goodman, please report
to a Woody Allen movie.

26:11.210 --> 26:13.920
Hey... look who it is.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.710
You're nervous?

26:22.710 --> 26:23.790
Why?

26:23.790 --> 26:25.330
Things are different.

26:25.330 --> 26:27.170
Are they?

26:27.170 --> 26:29.250
Yeah.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.880
He likes me.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.120
He always liked you.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.040
Yeah, but now I know.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.670
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

26:37.670 --> 26:40.880
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.830
Are you okay? Huh.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.460
Yeah, I'm very okay.

26:46.460 --> 26:49.460
Good, that's good.

26:49.460 --> 26:52.040
Do I not seem okay?

26:52.040 --> 26:54.580
You seem better than okay.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.580
Well, are you okay?

26:56.580 --> 26:59.960
Whoa!
Clearly, you two have a lot
to talk about.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.460
We'll leave you to it.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.290
Later, taters.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.250
-Taters later?
-Sounds good.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.250
See ya.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.960
Ugh! That was excruciating.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.330
"Okay?" "Okay."

27:17.330 --> 27:19.500
"Okay?" "Okay."

27:19.500 --> 27:22.620
Like, honestly?
It was like, if pudding
could talk.

27:22.620 --> 27:24.540
It was adorable,
and you know it.

27:24.540 --> 27:26.210
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

27:26.210 --> 27:27.920
Is it working?

27:27.920 --> 27:30.790
Buffy, seeing Andi and Jonah
together is not painful.

27:30.790 --> 27:33.920
Is that what you're going
to tell your stepmother?

27:33.920 --> 27:37.040
Okay, fine.
I wanna talk to Andi
about what I'm feeling.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.880
I want her to give me advice.

27:38.880 --> 27:39.960
I want her to think
it's kinda funny

27:39.960 --> 27:42.120
we both have a crush
on the same guy.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.500
Cyrus, you can have
all those things.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.580
You just have to tell her.

27:47.580 --> 27:48.920
You're right.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.620
You're right.
You're exactly right.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.290
You're not gonna
tell her, are you?

27:53.290 --> 27:55.960
-Or course not.
-Well, then, what
are you gonna do?

27:55.960 --> 27:58.920
You can't spend every day
together and not tell her.

27:58.920 --> 28:01.040
Well, I'm certainly
gonna give it my best shot.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.670
Cyrus...

28:02.670 --> 28:06.540
Which I can't do,
without you being patient
and non-judgmental.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.210
Look, I know these
are not your strong suits,

28:10.210 --> 28:12.500
but please, just try.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
If that's what you want.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.120
It is.

28:18.380 --> 28:20.670
-My only concern is--
-You call that trying?

28:20.670 --> 28:23.120
You didn't even make it
two seconds.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.500
(sighs)

28:32.210 --> 28:35.460
-Hey, hi!
-Finally!
You're late!

28:37.380 --> 28:39.000
Actually, I'm early.

28:40.670 --> 28:42.000
We have a problem.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.540
We do?

28:43.540 --> 28:46.290
Please!
I need you to focus.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.960
Wait-- Is there really
a problem?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.120
Yes, Bex.
It's major.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.500
Life threatening.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.500
Well, what is it?

28:54.500 --> 28:55.710
What do you need me
to do?

28:55.710 --> 28:57.210
My makeup.

28:57.210 --> 28:58.790
(sighs)

28:58.790 --> 29:00.250
Right...

29:00.250 --> 29:01.670
You were always good
at that.

29:01.670 --> 29:03.170
Scaring me.

29:03.170 --> 29:04.710
Even when you were four.

29:04.710 --> 29:07.120
Oh, come on.
I was just showing you
I could hold my breath

29:07.120 --> 29:08.580
for a very long time.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.460
I didn't think you were
gonna call an ambulance.

29:12.830 --> 29:13.830
Smock me.

29:17.750 --> 29:20.500
Every year my sorority
throws this epic party.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.170
The Black and White Ball.

29:22.170 --> 29:26.170
It's tonight, and I literally
need to slay everyone.

29:26.170 --> 29:27.380
Figuratively.

29:27.380 --> 29:29.830
Literally, don't know
what you're talking about.

29:31.790 --> 29:33.380
So what are we doing here?

29:33.380 --> 29:36.250
Something simple,
yet timeless.

29:36.250 --> 29:39.000
Classic, that's never
been done.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.420
In other words,
you want the impossible.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.290
-I just thought it'd be
more fun, you know?
-(door chimes)

29:47.290 --> 29:49.210
So, I see him
coming down the hall,

29:49.210 --> 29:53.670
and my brain just--
it's frozen like a block of ice.

29:53.670 --> 29:57.080
So he asked me
the simplest question,
"What's your next class?"

29:57.080 --> 29:58.710
Which is English.

29:58.710 --> 30:00.120
But guess what I said?

30:01.960 --> 30:03.290
Dimples.

30:03.290 --> 30:05.210
You did not.

30:05.210 --> 30:07.540
No, I was there, I heard it.

30:07.540 --> 30:10.250
I said dimples.

30:10.250 --> 30:12.580
(door chimes)

30:12.580 --> 30:14.000
It's Amber.

30:18.670 --> 30:21.790
Whoa.
Did you see that?

30:21.790 --> 30:23.750
She can't even
look at you.

30:23.750 --> 30:27.170
You won.
This is your turf now.

30:27.170 --> 30:28.790
I have turf?

30:28.790 --> 30:30.710
I have never had turf.

30:30.710 --> 30:32.710
You have more than turf.

30:32.710 --> 30:35.710
You're glowing
with alpha self-confidence.

30:35.710 --> 30:37.380
Let's not push it.

30:37.380 --> 30:40.330
It's only day one
and I'm already exhausted.

30:40.330 --> 30:45.290
It feels like I have to be
cute, and on all the time.

30:45.290 --> 30:47.920
You don't.
Just be yourself.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.040
You don't have
to change anything.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.620
(door chimes)

30:51.620 --> 30:55.120
Just stop looking
at the door every time
it chimes.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.920
-Change that.
-I don't do that.

30:57.920 --> 31:02.170
-(door chimes)
-What's happening to me?

31:02.170 --> 31:05.620
Don't look now,
but you may be turning into...

31:05.620 --> 31:08.210
a girlfriend!
Mwah-ahhh!

31:08.210 --> 31:10.170
No, seriously.

31:10.170 --> 31:12.170
Seriously.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.210
Am I?
Is that a bad thing?

31:14.210 --> 31:16.750
I thought it's
what you wanted.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.250
It is!
I just thought it'd be
more fun, you know,

31:19.250 --> 31:20.920
like a breath mint commercial.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.080
Switch seats with me.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.170
Why are we doing this?

31:29.170 --> 31:31.290
I don't wanna
keep watching the door.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.170
And let's talk
about something else.

31:33.170 --> 31:34.710
You!
What's going on with you?

31:34.710 --> 31:36.750
Nothing major.

31:36.750 --> 31:39.000
Oh!
They moved me up
to level seven math,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.380
-which is pretty good--
-(door chimes)

31:40.380 --> 31:42.120
It's Jonah, he's here.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.250
I see that.

31:44.250 --> 31:48.290
Buffy, it's starting to happen,
my brain is starting to freeze.

31:48.290 --> 31:49.250
Hey, guys.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.580
Hey.

31:50.580 --> 31:52.080
What's goin' on?

31:52.080 --> 31:53.170
Dimples.

31:58.290 --> 31:59.540
(no dialogue)

32:06.880 --> 32:09.290
-Yo, Jo!
-Cy guy!

32:09.290 --> 32:10.670
Ahhh!

32:10.670 --> 32:12.210
You all remember Iris?

32:12.210 --> 32:13.330
Your girlfriend.

32:13.330 --> 32:15.080
How could we forget?

32:15.080 --> 32:16.120
Hi!

32:16.120 --> 32:17.670
Nice to see you again.

32:17.670 --> 32:19.790
Hey, what you doin'
way over there?

32:19.790 --> 32:21.620
There, that's better.

32:21.620 --> 32:22.750
Now what can I get you?

32:22.750 --> 32:24.330
What are you having?

32:24.330 --> 32:26.710
I'm having, uh, baby taters
and a chocolate milk shake,

32:26.710 --> 32:29.750
or what's known around here
as the Cyrus Special.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.790
Iris:
I'll have what you're having.

32:31.790 --> 32:33.380
Yes! Yes.

32:33.380 --> 32:36.170
We'll just have to start
calling it the Ciris
with an "I" Special.

32:36.170 --> 32:37.210
(giggles)

32:37.210 --> 32:39.460
(quietly)
Be still my lunch.

32:39.460 --> 32:41.040

They're such a cute couple.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.460

see me, they are going

Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

You are a genius.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.710
You are the Stephen Hawking
of pressed powder.

34:42.710 --> 34:44.710
You should really consider
doing this for a living.

34:44.710 --> 34:46.040
I do.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.960
Really? Where?

Here.

34:49.500 --> 34:53.250
Oh, no, I mean,
in the real world.
This is the fringe.

34:53.250 --> 34:57.120
People come here
to buy fart machines and socks
that smell like bacon.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.920
(knocking on door)

34:58.920 --> 35:00.790
I don't want anyone
to see me yet!

35:00.790 --> 35:01.920
(sighs)

35:03.670 --> 35:05.120
Except me.

35:13.540 --> 35:15.290
Bex! Pizza?

35:15.290 --> 35:18.460
(scoff) I can't let pizza
anywhere near... this.

35:18.460 --> 35:20.210
Well, don't worry,
it's not for you.

35:21.460 --> 35:24.040
Do you mind moving it somewhere
I can't smell it?

35:31.000 --> 35:32.380
Who's Bowie?

35:32.380 --> 35:33.500
I like that name.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.290
Andi's father.

35:35.290 --> 35:37.920
Oh, so,
your high school boyfriend.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.500
Bex and Bowie.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.040
So fun.
Are you guys back together?

35:42.040 --> 35:43.500
Um...

35:43.500 --> 35:45.540
You're not.
That's good.

35:45.540 --> 35:47.250
High school boyfriends
don't keep well.

35:47.250 --> 35:48.460
I didn't say that.

35:48.460 --> 35:50.420
All I said was, "Um."

35:50.420 --> 35:51.920
That's all you needed to say.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.500
Just listen to your "Um."

35:54.500 --> 35:55.880
You should know that
by now.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.460
Aren't you, like, 40?

35:57.460 --> 35:58.580
No!

36:03.830 --> 36:05.380
I'm not 40!

36:05.380 --> 36:06.670
Mm-hm.

36:06.670 --> 36:08.710
You think I'm 40?

36:15.210 --> 36:16.290
Ugh...

36:16.290 --> 36:19.670
We'll be having two
of the Cyrus Special.

36:19.670 --> 36:22.500
This is a specialty item
and since you're new here--

36:22.500 --> 36:24.540
I have to use the restroom.

36:24.540 --> 36:25.960
Me too.

36:25.960 --> 36:29.670
Ah... the ladies.
They love to travel
in pairs.

36:29.670 --> 36:31.120
As I was saying--

36:31.120 --> 36:33.670
-Can I talk to you?
-Of course.

36:33.670 --> 36:34.920
Outside?

36:39.830 --> 36:41.620
This is kind of a crazy crowd.

36:41.620 --> 36:43.830
I really like
that you're so uncomplicated.

36:50.960 --> 36:55.120
Why here?
Why does she have to work here
at the Spoon?

36:55.120 --> 36:57.620
Or as I choose to call it now,
the Knife.

36:57.620 --> 37:00.170
-What do you wanna do?
-I want to leave.

37:00.170 --> 37:03.330
-Then let's leave.
-We can't leave!

37:03.330 --> 37:05.380
(sighs)
I don't wanna look
so insecure

37:05.380 --> 37:07.290
I can't even be around Amber.

37:07.290 --> 37:08.620
Which you are not.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.580
Buffy, what's happening
to me?

37:12.830 --> 37:14.290
I'm all nervous
and tongue-tied

37:14.290 --> 37:16.710
like I was
the first time
I ever talked to him.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.830
I have a suggestion.

37:19.830 --> 37:22.210
Fantastic, I'm glad
someone does.

37:22.210 --> 37:25.000
But, you're
not going to like it.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.040
Buffy, you know
you can tell me anything.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.790
Maybe, you're not ready
for this kind of relationship
with Jonah.

37:31.790 --> 37:34.620
Why would you say that to me?

37:34.620 --> 37:38.290
Look, I think you two
could be great friends.

37:38.290 --> 37:41.120
And maybe for now,
that's all you should be.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.620
Why do you keep
saying that?

37:43.620 --> 37:47.670
Jonah Beck likes me.
This is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

37:47.670 --> 37:50.120
I'm extremely happy.

37:51.620 --> 37:55.170
Ketchup?
Where we're going
we don't need ketchup!

37:55.170 --> 37:57.080
Okay, so this is the DeLorean,

37:57.080 --> 37:59.580
and this is the flux
capaci-tater.

37:59.580 --> 38:02.670
Which is a play
on flux capacitor.

38:02.670 --> 38:06.710
As you get to know me,
I'll have to spell out
fewer and fewer of my jokes.

38:06.710 --> 38:09.380
Hey, you guys
got back just in time to see
Marty McTater disappear

38:09.380 --> 38:10.540
at the high school dance.

38:11.540 --> 38:12.710
Where's Jonah?

38:12.710 --> 38:15.750
Oh, no!
I've gotta get my mom
to kiss my dad!

38:15.750 --> 38:16.750
That's heavy!

38:25.040 --> 38:26.830
(knocking on window)

38:46.750 --> 38:48.080
Sorry.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.710
It's been really hard.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.750
I'm sure it has.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.710
My dad really doesn't want
anyone to know he lost his job.

38:58.790 --> 39:01.170
He didn't even tell us
for months.

39:01.170 --> 39:04.500
He just kept
pretending to go to work.

39:05.540 --> 39:07.210
I promise I won't tell anyone.

39:08.290 --> 39:11.120
It felt really good
to talk about it.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.290
I've been holding it in
for months.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.750
Thanks for listening.

39:16.830 --> 39:17.960
Anytime.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.210
Really?

39:20.540 --> 39:24.040
Nah...
I don't wanna be
your sad friend.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.540
I'd rather be
your mean ex-girlfriend.

39:26.540 --> 39:28.250

39:53.880 --> 39:56.500
That looked like
a pretty interesting
conversation.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.330
(sighs)
Not really.

39:59.380 --> 40:01.790
No?
What about the hug?

40:01.790 --> 40:04.750
-Was that interesting?
-Just... leave it alone.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.620
Fine.
I'll leave it alone.

40:11.420 --> 40:15.290
But you need to understand.
We're not just friends.

40:15.290 --> 40:16.920
We're like a really small gang.

40:18.460 --> 40:19.790
And when she's sad...

40:21.540 --> 40:24.710
let's just say you don't wanna
see me when she's sad.

40:27.750 --> 40:28.790
I'm sorry.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.420
That was a really
nice thing to say.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.670
But why did you
have to say it?

40:57.750 --> 40:59.290
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:00.580 --> 41:02.170
Can I say something?

41:02.170 --> 41:03.250
Sure.

41:03.250 --> 41:04.580
About Amber.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.290
Okay.

41:09.080 --> 41:11.330
I don't care what you guys
talked about.

41:12.880 --> 41:14.380
You don't?

41:14.380 --> 41:15.830
I really don't.

41:15.830 --> 41:19.170
All that matters to me
is what we talk about.

41:20.880 --> 41:23.830
But, today we didn't talk
about anything.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.500
Yeah, we did.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.000
Remind me.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.500
We talked about your classes.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.670
Oh-- 'Kay, thanks,
I remember now.

41:34.670 --> 41:36.210
Wait-- What was
that class called?

41:36.210 --> 41:37.830
Don't say it!
(laughs)

41:37.830 --> 41:39.620
Oh, right, dimples.
(laughs)

41:39.620 --> 41:41.460
You're not supposed
to talk about that stuff.

41:41.460 --> 41:43.120
But why?
Come on, it's the best stuff.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.830
It-- It is, to you.

41:45.830 --> 41:48.250
Because you never
say anything embarrassing.

41:48.250 --> 41:49.960
I say embarrassing stuff
all the time.

41:49.960 --> 41:52.790
-Like what?
-I'm not gonna tell you,
it's too embarrassing.

41:52.790 --> 41:55.120
Just one little sentence.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.500
Hey.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.420
-Who wants pizza?
-Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

42:11.420 --> 42:12.710
sorry.

42:12.710 --> 42:15.830
I've already had
my emotionally fraught pizza
of the day.

42:16.830 --> 42:20.120
Have we any other
cheese products nearby?

42:20.120 --> 42:23.500
I believe we have cheese
in the form of cream
and string.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.500
Was it that kinda day?

42:26.500 --> 42:29.960
It feels like I might be
in for a long stretch of pizza.

42:31.210 --> 42:33.000
You wanna talk about it?

42:33.000 --> 42:34.920
Tell me about your pizza first.

42:34.920 --> 42:38.290
Hmmm... it was from Bowie.

42:38.290 --> 42:39.420
Awww.

42:39.420 --> 42:41.920
There was a rose
taped to the top
of the box.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.500
Aw!

42:43.500 --> 42:44.880
It was very sweet.

42:46.460 --> 42:49.170
Look, I know you said
you needed more time,

42:49.170 --> 42:52.750
but... how much more time
do you need?

42:54.960 --> 42:56.330
None.

42:56.330 --> 42:57.540
What?

42:57.540 --> 42:59.380
What?
This is so exciting,

42:59.380 --> 43:00.420
I can't believe it!

43:00.420 --> 43:02.000
Andi, please, calm down.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.080
How can I calm down?
This is the best news ever.

43:05.080 --> 43:07.080
You're getting married!

43:07.080 --> 43:08.170
Andi, I'm not.

43:09.330 --> 43:10.920
Not, what?

43:12.960 --> 43:15.170
I'm not getting married
to Bowie.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.210
Andi:
Next, on Andi Mack...

43:24.210 --> 43:25.460
It's Chinese New Year.

43:25.460 --> 43:26.500
Yeah.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.830
What did I just do?

43:27.830 --> 43:30.120
Invited a boy you like
into the belly of the beast.

43:30.120 --> 43:32.040
You're wearing white,
the color of death.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.330
But please, come in.

43:33.330 --> 43:34.460
Who is he again?

43:34.460 --> 43:36.330
I just assumed he was
Andi's boyfriend.

43:36.330 --> 43:38.750
Andi's not allowed to have
a boyfriend.

43:38.750 --> 43:39.920
He's Andi's father.

43:39.920 --> 43:40.920
Andi's father?

43:40.920 --> 43:42.330
Bex and I might have
some happy news

43:42.330 --> 43:43.620
to share soon.

43:43.620 --> 43:45.290
I'll always love you,

43:45.290 --> 43:47.120
but that bond is Andi.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.330
Are you okay?

43:48.330 --> 43:50.000
Of course I'm not okay.
