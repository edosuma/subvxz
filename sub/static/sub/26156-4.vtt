WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:01.827
- Where are you going? - To London, 
to tell Special Branch I'm done.

00:01.851 --> 00:04.971
- Because you're pregnant?
- Caddy's the father? -  Not a chance.

00:04.971 --> 00:07.172
Dennis' balls are clinically drier
than a witch's tit.

00:07.109 --> 00:09.109
 He thinks it's a miracle.

00:09.170 --> 00:11.915
- I don't owe you anything.
- You may not have remembered Joy, but

00:11.940 --> 00:12.476
she remembered you.

00:12.530 --> 00:15.290
Albion don't know who the mole is,
hence the threat to Miller.

00:15.290 --> 00:18.770
You made yourself my handler, Dinah.
I need handling.

00:18.770 --> 00:20.087
Hey, what you doing?!

00:20.149 --> 00:22.970
You're about to be charged with the
hate crime murder of Abel Lander.

00:22.970 --> 00:25.410
She's not as scared as I am,
is she, ma'am?

00:25.410 --> 00:26.490
She's not, Stuart.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.930
On the night of the hustings,
were the candidates searched?

00:28.930 --> 00:30.850
- Was Caroline?
- No, they were all fast-tracked.

00:30.850 --> 00:33.810
I hereby announce that
Caroline McCoy is duly elected

00:33.810 --> 00:35.770
the Mayor of the City of Manchester

00:35.770 --> 00:37.970
Jesus! What's the gun for?

00:37.970 --> 00:40.930
Police! Dirkin's been hit.

00:40.930 --> 00:43.010
Beckett is still alive.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.450
He meant to miss.

00:45.690 --> 00:49.154
He meant to miss.

00:53.196 --> 00:55.796
Seems quiet enough.
Prank call?

00:55.796 --> 00:58.756
The caller was screaming
about drug dealing and violence,

00:58.756 --> 01:00.356
but it was all a bit hysterical.

01:01.956 --> 01:04.529
I'm gasping for a coffee.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074

01:25.916 --> 01:28.556
Oh, thank God! I'm Gabriel Turner,
this is my parents' house.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.636
- Nice place.
- Yeah, well, look at it!

01:30.636 --> 01:33.356
It's a private party,
so nothing to do with us, really.

01:33.356 --> 01:36.036
Carrie Blackburn just gave Matthew
Price a blowjob in the hot tub.

01:36.036 --> 01:37.996
She's 15 and it's going to
bugger the filters.

01:37.996 --> 01:40.076
Like I said, not our problem.

01:44.396 --> 01:47.276
You've got to do
something about this.

01:47.276 --> 01:50.276
OK, well, look, there's a
drug dealer here, right now,

01:50.276 --> 01:53.036
with actual drugs next door.

01:53.036 --> 01:56.756
You guys have to do
something about that. Come on.

01:56.756 --> 01:58.876
Come on, hurry up, hurry up!

02:01.356 --> 02:03.796
That one there!
Yeah, she's the dealer.

02:03.796 --> 02:06.596
THEY CHANT: Tessa! Tessa!

02:06.596 --> 02:08.356
Is that Tess?

02:10.675 --> 02:13.396
Shit! Jesus.

02:13.396 --> 02:15.996
Dinah's going to go mental.

02:44.956 --> 02:49.036
- Where's Dennis? - Inside with Spike.
- You come and see me after, yeah?

02:49.036 --> 02:51.716
Dennis' rancid little heart will
be breaking without you, love.

02:51.716 --> 02:53.436
Pop in, make sure he don't
get suspicious.

02:53.436 --> 02:55.916
Right cos 30 seconds out here,
that'll do it, not the 50 bloody

02:55.916 --> 02:58.276
armed policemen who turned up
out of nowhere in the woods -

02:58.276 --> 03:01.036
- he'll think that's totally legit, won't he?!
- Morning, Viv!

03:01.036 --> 03:04.796
Well, I'm off fishing fascist
brains out of a Persian rug.

03:04.796 --> 03:08.196
Killed by one of his own,
doing the job for us, pop.

03:09.636 --> 03:12.516
- Who's got you by the flaps then?
- Come here. - What?

03:12.516 --> 03:14.916
Is this a bollocking or a hand
job? I didn't bring wet wipes.

03:14.916 --> 03:17.596
Shame, I forgot the baby oil.
Get in!

03:19.596 --> 03:23.196
The suspect was in possession
of a firearm and a bag containing

03:23.196 --> 03:25.596
Â£40,000 in cash.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.516
Not so gobby now, are you?

03:29.076 --> 03:32.156
His brief's on her way - should have
him charged by lunchtime.

03:32.156 --> 03:36.036
Just remind me, what is it for
possession of a firearm nowadays?

03:36.036 --> 03:38.409
-  Seven years? -  Ten.
-  Ten?

03:39.916 --> 03:41.156
Ten years.

03:42.796 --> 03:45.316
This is for Joy, you piece of shit.

03:49.316 --> 03:56.116
Caroline McCoy? Caroline bloody
McCoy? What, and this is nailed on?

03:56.116 --> 04:00.276
So our girl is dead so that
bint could become a politician?

04:00.276 --> 04:02.356
And I have nothing to prove it.

04:02.356 --> 04:06.196
Go through Dirkin's things, anything
and everything in the house.

04:06.196 --> 04:09.636
I need something that's going to
link Caroline and Dirkin.

04:09.636 --> 04:11.796
No sooner said, I'm right on it.

04:13.476 --> 04:17.396
Jesus Christ! You should've said,
you could've used our bin.

04:17.396 --> 04:20.636
Thanks. You told him? Dinah?

04:20.636 --> 04:23.356
Yeah, this one I don't need to see.

04:23.356 --> 04:26.316
What's this?
Masons or Weight Watchers?

04:30.676 --> 04:32.716
We'll get her, I promise you.

04:37.276 --> 04:39.716
Ma'am. Dinah.

04:39.716 --> 04:42.596
Caroline McCoy faked her own
assassination attempt so she

04:42.596 --> 04:44.716
could swing the vote
and win the election.

04:44.716 --> 04:49.116
She even smuggled the gun
into the town hall for Beckett.

04:49.116 --> 04:51.436
I know. I'm feeling it.

04:51.436 --> 04:55.036
When I see that bitch...
You won't have to wait too long.

04:55.036 --> 04:57.516
I've just had a call
from the town hall,

04:57.516 --> 05:00.516
Caroline McCoy's on her way over -
photo op.

05:00.516 --> 05:03.556
A chance to thank her
supporters in the station.

05:03.556 --> 05:05.836
- When?
-  About an hour.

05:05.836 --> 05:08.876
Now, what are we going to
do about Dennis?

05:08.876 --> 05:11.076
- Well, we've got him with a gun.
- That's ten years, easy.

05:11.076 --> 05:13.076
Let's just charge him
and tell Bonnie it's over.

05:13.076 --> 05:15.796
I don't want him charged,
I want him back out there.

05:15.796 --> 05:17.876
Viv, there's no way
Bonnie's cover can hold.

05:17.876 --> 05:20.556
Not Bonnie, she's finished
all right.

05:20.556 --> 05:23.276
You were spitting nails the last
time we had to release Dennis.

05:23.276 --> 05:25.596
Yeah, that was before I let
Caroline bloody McCoy get her

05:25.596 --> 05:29.636
hands on a billion pound budget
and the keys to our city.

05:29.636 --> 05:33.276
How the hell could we not have
known that she was running around

05:33.276 --> 05:34.636
with Albion?

05:34.636 --> 05:36.796
What else have we missed?

05:36.796 --> 05:39.276
And don't get me started
on Joseph Beckett

05:39.276 --> 05:42.916
cos he's still out there, knocking
off whoever the hell he fancies.

05:42.916 --> 05:45.796
All we have got is Dennis Caddy.

05:45.796 --> 05:47.436
You can't just release him.

05:47.436 --> 05:50.516
No, no, I want him working.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.476
I want him working for us.

05:52.476 --> 05:54.756
He's our one chance
of nailing them both.

05:54.756 --> 05:56.196
I'm going to mess with his head,

05:56.196 --> 05:59.436
and I'm going to get him
to see that we are his only hope.

05:59.436 --> 06:03.676
And once we've got him,
we can take down Caroline, too.

06:03.676 --> 06:06.516
I'm sure there's meant to be
sweeping violins underneath

06:06.516 --> 06:11.836
that grand speech but there's no way
that you're going to turn Dennis,

06:11.836 --> 06:13.396
not in 24 hours.

06:16.916 --> 06:18.916
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am,

06:18.916 --> 06:21.196
but Dennis' lawyer's just
turned up in reception.

06:21.196 --> 06:22.716
It's Antonia Cairns.

06:28.356 --> 06:31.156
- Who pays for the lawyer, him or Albion?
- Albion.

06:31.156 --> 06:33.436
Keep her in reception,
don't let her talk to Dennis.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.556
OK, but it's his legal right.
How do I stop her?

06:35.556 --> 06:37.196
I'll help, come on.

06:37.196 --> 06:39.836
Viv, what are you planning?

06:39.836 --> 06:41.596
I'm going to blow Bonnie's cover.

06:44.356 --> 06:46.156
You blow her cover,
you're risking her life.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.316
Not if I do it right.

06:47.316 --> 06:49.556
You're exposing her to entrapment,
malfeasance,

06:49.556 --> 06:50.756
maybe even sexual assault.

06:50.756 --> 06:52.276
Go and get her, I need her up here.

06:52.276 --> 06:55.556
She'll spend the rest of her life
waiting for Albion to find her...

06:55.556 --> 07:00.676
- and kill her. - Dinah, you're
a Sergeant now, my Sergeant.

07:00.676 --> 07:02.676
We're going to do this.

07:02.676 --> 07:04.716
Yeah...

07:04.716 --> 07:08.076
Funny story, actually,
do you remember that old lady

07:08.076 --> 07:10.476
that you represented...
Oh, Philippa...

07:10.476 --> 07:12.196
- Philippa whatshername?
- Jonah...

07:12.196 --> 07:15.036
She used to take her clothes off in
custody, she crapped in the corner.

07:15.036 --> 07:17.196
Used to growl...

07:17.196 --> 07:19.756
- ...like a little terrier.
- What are you doing?

07:19.756 --> 07:21.196
Just that erm...

07:21.196 --> 07:23.996
Ma'am needs to see
you before you go through.

07:23.996 --> 07:26.316
So just say so and shut up.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.796
Where's my lawyer?

07:31.796 --> 07:33.756
Dennis, love,
I'm going to tell you the truth.

07:33.756 --> 07:36.356
Now, no-one else will, and I would
like you to remember that.

07:36.356 --> 07:37.356
I want my lawyer.

07:37.356 --> 07:39.476
All your lawyer's going to do
is tut and say,

07:39.476 --> 07:42.196
"Oh, dear me, Dennis, you have made
a real mess of it this time."

07:42.196 --> 07:44.676
Because the thing that she's going
to be worrying about

07:44.676 --> 07:46.396
is how all this affects Albion.

07:46.396 --> 07:48.316
You're just a grunt to her.

07:48.316 --> 07:49.796
Well, let's see.

07:52.196 --> 07:54.556
We arrested your sister
Faye yesterday.

07:54.556 --> 07:57.156
- What for?
-  Murder.

07:57.156 --> 07:59.236
She's on her way up
to Durham right now.

07:59.236 --> 08:00.876
Gone right off her food.

08:00.876 --> 08:03.676
Just shows what the prospect of life
inside can do to you.

08:03.676 --> 08:05.796
Murder? That's shit!

08:05.796 --> 08:12.476
Point is, she's gone and Albion
are about to abandon you.

08:12.476 --> 08:15.596
Now, I know you that you think
that you're the big cheese,

08:15.596 --> 08:19.714
- but not any more, you're on your own.
-  Really?

08:21.556 --> 08:24.436
How come we found you last night?

08:24.436 --> 08:27.476
No, no, no, she can't, she can't!

08:27.476 --> 08:31.676
Lucky guess, was it? I know you've
been wondering about that.

08:31.676 --> 08:34.076
Who's the mole, Dennis?

08:36.676 --> 08:37.956
What if she can't hold him?

08:37.956 --> 08:40.316
- What the fuck happens to me then?!
- Just wait.

08:42.476 --> 08:45.316
- You already know.
- Bollocks.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.236
Your girlfriend,
Bonnie Sands, works for me.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.436
No. No fucking way.

08:52.556 --> 08:53.956
You know that already.

08:53.956 --> 08:56.556
Why else would she be with you?

08:56.556 --> 09:00.796
I want my lawyer,
I'm not saying another word.

09:00.796 --> 09:03.196
Oh, my God, you do not want her.

09:03.196 --> 09:05.236
You know what that rabble at Albion
will do to you

09:05.236 --> 09:07.996
when she tells them
what you've done.

09:07.996 --> 09:10.436
You passed on all this
info to the police?

09:10.436 --> 09:12.876
They're going to take
a razor blade to your balls.

09:12.876 --> 09:15.596
Bonnie - no way.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.036
Go fuck yourself.

09:17.036 --> 09:18.956
Call her.

09:19.996 --> 09:23.996
If she's not a cop, then she'll
be downstairs in the cells,

09:23.996 --> 09:26.196
and her phone will be impounded.

09:26.196 --> 09:29.836
That's right, isn't it?
So call her.

09:29.836 --> 09:30.996
See what happens.

09:32.836 --> 09:34.836
Go on...

09:36.156 --> 09:37.596
...call her.

09:39.076 --> 09:40.716
This is such bullshit.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.836
- Answer it.
-  I can't.

09:57.836 --> 10:00.196
What are you trying to do to me?

10:04.436 --> 10:08.156
Bonnie, you have to.
Answer it and you're free.

10:14.636 --> 10:16.396
Jesus, you really had me!

10:18.556 --> 10:20.836
You've got some balls, lady.

10:20.836 --> 10:24.236
If I hadn't called,
you'd be in my head all right.

10:24.236 --> 10:26.796
Jesus!

10:26.796 --> 10:27.716
Fuck!

10:29.356 --> 10:31.476
Sorry, I missed your call.

10:31.476 --> 10:32.996
What was it you wanted?

10:49.075 --> 10:51.075
You sober enough to talk to yet?

10:58.355 --> 10:59.635
Where's your mum?

10:59.635 --> 11:02.355
Dunno. She's not come home.

11:02.355 --> 11:03.955
She lives at that cop shop.

11:05.075 --> 11:06.595
Oh, my days, my bloody head.

11:07.715 --> 11:09.515
Nice. 15 and hungover.

11:09.515 --> 11:11.075
Future of our country, right here.

11:11.075 --> 11:13.235
Oh, please, like you weren't off
your tits at my age.

11:13.235 --> 11:15.475
- But I wasn't dealing drugs.
- Neither was I.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.875
I've got a very angry young man
who says otherwise.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.955
He wants you done for dealing, Tess.

11:19.955 --> 11:22.515
Well, I wasn't. All right?
I swear, I wasn't.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.755
Shit.

11:30.635 --> 11:32.595
Stu, am I in trouble?

11:32.595 --> 11:34.075
I don't know. Tell me about it.

11:44.116 --> 11:46.716
Tess! Tell me about it!

11:46.716 --> 11:48.236
All right!

11:49.396 --> 11:51.276
I had some pills on me.

11:51.276 --> 11:52.436
Pills?

11:52.436 --> 11:54.396
Yeah, like a handful, that's all.

11:55.476 --> 11:57.316
I was sharing them out with
my mates.

11:57.316 --> 11:58.876
And then Gabriel swans over,

11:58.876 --> 12:01.796
all full of himself and goes,
"Oi, give me one, it's party tax."

12:01.796 --> 12:03.076
He took a pill himself?

12:03.076 --> 12:05.396
No, cos I told him he'd have to
pay, like everyone else.

12:05.396 --> 12:07.756
- Oh, Jesus.
-  It was a joke.

12:07.756 --> 12:09.396
And he knew it was a joke.

12:11.916 --> 12:14.876
That's not dealing-dealing, is it?

12:16.956 --> 12:18.996
I mean, he only came over to me
cos he fancies me.

12:20.356 --> 12:21.676
He knows you?

12:21.676 --> 12:22.676
Course he does.

12:24.756 --> 12:26.876
How many pills you still got?

12:26.876 --> 12:27.876
Some.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.876
These are going down the loo.

12:39.876 --> 12:42.076
I'll talk to the kid
and make this go away.

12:42.076 --> 12:45.436
And Dinah's not going to know a
thing about it, right?

12:45.436 --> 12:49.396
It's the least we can do after
Joy and everything.

12:49.396 --> 12:50.876
Thanks, Stu.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.196
Listen...

12:57.196 --> 13:00.956
...I know you're a kid and,
yeah, I did shit, too,

13:00.956 --> 13:03.316
but you're also a cop's daughter.

13:09.156 --> 13:12.236
 Anthonia Cairns? Detective Chief
Superintendent Marchant.

13:12.236 --> 13:15.956
Good. I was hoping to speak to
someone senior because

13:15.956 --> 13:19.316
the procedural violations in this
station today,

13:19.316 --> 13:21.636
perpetrated by this numbskull,
are inexcusable.

13:21.636 --> 13:23.596
To be honest,
I'm surprised you're here.

13:23.596 --> 13:26.876
What with the sad demise of
Mr Lionel Dirkin, I'd assumed

13:26.876 --> 13:28.876
you passed on Mr Caddy.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.476
I'm sorry, what?

13:30.476 --> 13:34.796
Haven't you heard? Lionel Dirkin
was shot in his home last night.

13:34.796 --> 13:36.876
Sorry, should I have mentioned that?

13:36.876 --> 13:38.716
Dirkin pays Albion's fees,

13:38.716 --> 13:40.836
so unless you're here for
some pro bono work,

13:40.836 --> 13:42.916
or you're particularly fond
of the Far Right...

13:42.916 --> 13:44.716
Mark, I'm at the station.

13:44.716 --> 13:46.596
What's this about Dirkin?

13:47.876 --> 13:49.596
All right.

13:51.316 --> 13:55.076
Well, I don't know what was going
on here but, as of now, I don't care.

13:55.076 --> 13:57.916
The nasty little shit's all yours.

13:57.916 --> 13:59.156
Jonah, it was memorable.

14:01.116 --> 14:02.796
Inspector, you've made my day.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.476
Tell Dennis he's lost his brief.

14:07.476 --> 14:10.156
Offer him some bog-standard
duty solicitor and make

14:10.156 --> 14:13.316
the prospect as appealing as
sticking his tongue in a blender.

14:18.276 --> 14:19.876
- There she is!
-  Madam Mayor.

14:21.356 --> 14:22.716
Oh, it's weird, eh?

14:22.716 --> 14:25.116
A little scrapper
from Cinderly like me.

14:25.116 --> 14:26.396
Who are these shiny people?

14:26.396 --> 14:28.596
Oh, that's Meg and Daniel -
they're doing the comms.

14:28.596 --> 14:30.836
Basically telling me when I'm
not smiling enough.

14:30.836 --> 14:32.836
But it was my idea to come here.

14:32.836 --> 14:34.516
I mean, I only won because of you.

14:34.516 --> 14:38.236
Oh, don't blame me for that!
But you're all very welcome.

14:38.236 --> 14:40.356
Now, what can we do for you today?

14:40.356 --> 14:43.196
Ten minutes with the troops,
tell them how much they matter,

14:43.196 --> 14:46.076
- a few photos. -  No problem.
- And then, maybe, you and me.

14:46.076 --> 14:49.996
A few minutes,
no cameras, just us. Lovely.

14:49.996 --> 14:52.956
I can fill you in on the
Lionel Dirkin murder.

14:52.956 --> 14:56.316
Oh, don't you worry... We're making
exceptional progress on that.

15:02.316 --> 15:03.956
His lawyer's gone.

15:03.956 --> 15:05.836
Didn't even speak to Dennis.

15:05.836 --> 15:08.796
Couldn't see her for dust when she
realised her line of credit

15:08.796 --> 15:11.156
died with Dirkin.

15:12.236 --> 15:13.876
So that's you done here, missus.

15:18.236 --> 15:20.316
You never have to see him again.

15:22.876 --> 15:26.476
We'll need to do a hot debrief,
psychological assessments,

15:26.476 --> 15:28.156
risk reports.

15:28.156 --> 15:30.256
As you'll know, it's protocol.

15:34.236 --> 15:36.996
All right, all right,
enough photos of the happy couple!

15:38.476 --> 15:41.836
You lot, you are bloody privileged
to have this woman here today,

15:41.836 --> 15:43.716
on her first day in office.

15:43.716 --> 15:44.756
Yes!

15:45.836 --> 15:48.116
No, no, I am privileged.

15:48.116 --> 15:51.196
You lot, the police,
you're taken for granted.

15:51.196 --> 15:54.156
I just want you to know that
I appreciate you.

15:54.156 --> 15:57.156
And well, things are going to
change now that I'm mayor.

15:57.156 --> 16:00.396
Not having one hand stuck behind
your back because of

16:00.396 --> 16:01.876
idiotic regulations.

16:01.876 --> 16:03.556
I am cutting the red tape

16:03.556 --> 16:06.196
and making you lot the cops
that you want to be.

16:06.196 --> 16:08.476
Yes!

17:23.796 --> 17:24.796
Hello?

17:27.876 --> 17:29.396
Hello?!

17:37.316 --> 17:38.476
Oh, hello.

17:38.476 --> 17:39.996
You not going to tidy up?

17:39.996 --> 17:42.756
No, Fatima's in tomorrow -
she'll get it done in no time.

17:44.636 --> 17:46.116
Fuck off! Get out.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.996
So, what's up?
Did you sort out that dealer?

17:52.996 --> 17:54.716
Oh, you mean Tessa Kowalska?

17:54.716 --> 17:56.036
I don't know, is that her name?

17:56.036 --> 17:57.236
Cut the shit, kid.

17:57.236 --> 17:59.396
You know exactly who she is.

17:59.396 --> 18:02.156
I've been running around town
cos you've got a crush

18:02.156 --> 18:04.756
on that girl and this is your
revenge for her turning you down.

18:04.756 --> 18:06.636
Am I right?

18:06.636 --> 18:08.236
Sort of.

18:08.236 --> 18:09.716
Sorry.

18:09.716 --> 18:12.596
Right, well, we're done.

18:12.596 --> 18:14.956
Good luck to your cleaner. Poor cow.

18:14.956 --> 18:17.076
I know Tess quite well actually.

18:17.076 --> 18:19.596
Like how her mum's a cop.

18:19.596 --> 18:21.076
And you're wrong about her dealing.

18:21.076 --> 18:22.676
I've got a video of it on my phone.

18:22.676 --> 18:23.956
If you look real closely,

18:23.956 --> 18:27.676
you can see her hand over a bunch
of pills, right...there.

18:27.676 --> 18:31.036
I don't know,
looks a lot like drug dealing to me.

18:31.036 --> 18:33.156
Do you want me to send you the clip?

18:33.156 --> 18:35.836
What am I saying? Of course you do.
You're a police officer.

18:35.836 --> 18:39.316
Unless you were trying to cover up a
crime cos the dealer's mum is a cop.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.036
You wouldn't do that, would you?

18:43.036 --> 18:45.756
I mean, that's some serious shit.

18:45.756 --> 18:47.356
Isn't it?

18:47.356 --> 18:49.036
So, Stuart -

18:49.036 --> 18:51.356
do you mind it if
I call you Stuart? -

18:51.356 --> 18:54.116
how are you going to get yourself
out of this mess, then?

18:57.636 --> 18:59.396
We arrested Dennis Caddy
at the scene.

18:59.396 --> 19:02.156
- Hopefully, we've got enough
to charge him. -  Yeah?

19:02.156 --> 19:03.156
What's he said?

19:04.556 --> 19:06.756
It's all no comment, I'm afraid.

19:06.756 --> 19:08.036
And Beckett?

19:08.036 --> 19:10.836
He was gone before we could
secure the scene.

19:10.836 --> 19:12.036
So he's still out there.

19:13.756 --> 19:16.116
Do you think he's going to come
after me again?

19:16.116 --> 19:19.556
I can arrange a new security detail,
if you're worried, love.

19:19.556 --> 19:20.876
Are you worried?

19:20.876 --> 19:25.276
I don't know, I'm just so tired,
you know? This campaign.

19:25.276 --> 19:28.556
But it makes you paranoid about
who you can trust.

19:30.516 --> 19:33.356
I saw you last night
at the Town Hall.

19:33.356 --> 19:35.516
You didn't seem very happy I'd won.

19:35.516 --> 19:37.556
I'm thrilled for you, love.

19:37.556 --> 19:38.996
I should've said at the time,

19:38.996 --> 19:40.956
but the Dirkin murder case blew up
on me.

19:43.276 --> 19:44.796
Come on now, bugger off -

19:44.796 --> 19:47.876
go and pester a fireman
for a photo opportunity.

19:47.876 --> 19:50.916
And if he wants to throw you
over his shoulder,

19:50.916 --> 19:53.396
make sure that you're
wearing clean kecks.

19:53.396 --> 19:58.556
I think I'm going to spend half the year
 in a high-vis jacket, aren't I? Hiya.

19:58.556 --> 20:02.036
So, uh...I'll see you, then.

20:02.036 --> 20:03.076
Good luck.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.556
You're always welcome here.

20:05.556 --> 20:06.596
It's good to know.

20:11.916 --> 20:13.476
This meeting isn't recorded.

20:13.476 --> 20:16.407
No lawyer, as agreed, no tape -
just us.

20:16.636 --> 20:18.977
- But no Bonnie.
-  That's right.

20:19.076 --> 20:21.156
Why didn't you kill Beckett?

20:21.156 --> 20:23.316
- Where is she?
-  She's gone.

20:23.316 --> 20:25.356
- I want to see her.
-  No.

20:25.356 --> 20:28.036
Now, you tell me about
Caroline McCoy.

20:28.036 --> 20:29.476
No, I don't know her.

20:29.476 --> 20:31.036
Oh, you know how this works -

20:31.036 --> 20:34.196
you help us and we talk to the CPS.

20:34.196 --> 20:37.636
You used a woman to entrap me,
to rape me...

20:37.636 --> 20:40.436
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Sex without consent.

20:40.436 --> 20:43.516
I would have never have fucking
touched her if I'd have known.

20:43.516 --> 20:46.196
Did you go to Caroline McCoy
with the plan for the faked

20:46.196 --> 20:48.236
assassination, or was it her idea?

20:48.236 --> 20:49.436
Ask Bonnie.

20:49.436 --> 20:51.156
So who organised it?

20:51.156 --> 20:52.436
I'm not doing this.

20:52.436 --> 20:56.436
I'm not sitting here when that
woman's out there with my baby.

20:56.436 --> 20:59.796
You know, thinking about all this,
what you've done,

20:59.796 --> 21:02.196
maybe I should have
a lawyer, after all.

21:02.196 --> 21:03.556
It's not your baby.

21:04.876 --> 21:06.916
You're a jaffa.

21:06.916 --> 21:11.716
She just played on your emotions
using some other fella's kid.

21:11.716 --> 21:13.876
No. I don't believe that.

21:13.876 --> 21:16.516
- Jesus wept.
-  Prove it.

21:16.516 --> 21:19.356
Until you can do that,
go fuck yourselves.

21:20.716 --> 21:23.836
I felt abused, ashamed.

21:23.836 --> 21:25.516
Often exploited.

21:25.516 --> 21:27.716
Angry with myself,
with the people who controlled me.

21:27.716 --> 21:30.796
Whoa, are we recording this for
a documentary, or what?

21:30.796 --> 21:32.236
What are you talking about?

21:32.236 --> 21:35.356
Bonnie, wherever you've been
for way too long,

21:35.356 --> 21:38.036
for God's sake, don't come home
sounding like a claims form.

21:38.036 --> 21:40.396
Are you asking for my serious
medical help,

21:40.396 --> 21:42.716
or are we just going to swipe
your card?

21:42.716 --> 21:43.716
I-I need help.

21:44.916 --> 21:46.756
Oh, sorry, Peep, can you...?

21:46.756 --> 21:50.116
We're in the middle of a
psych examination, you...off.

21:50.116 --> 21:51.116
What is it?

21:53.276 --> 21:56.476
We need you to do a blood test,
to prove the baby's not his.

21:56.476 --> 22:00.196
Miller can get the results back in a
few hours if we expedite.

22:00.196 --> 22:02.356
Just to shut the fantasies down.

22:03.476 --> 22:05.316
It'd really help.

22:05.316 --> 22:08.316
Well, A,
how does this help you one iota?

22:08.316 --> 22:09.676
Do you mind keeping out of this?

22:09.676 --> 22:11.916
I've been contracted by your
department to keep in it.

22:11.916 --> 22:15.516
B, this isn't her meeting, so either
one of us or both of us need

22:15.516 --> 22:18.876
to tell her to fuck right off,
or she's going to be reported to

22:18.876 --> 22:21.076
both departments for
professional harassment.

22:21.076 --> 22:24.116
But she's going to end up on my doorstep,
so I don't know why I'm offing.

22:24.116 --> 22:27.570
No, it's OK,
let's get it over with.

22:31.396 --> 22:32.396
Fuck.

22:33.836 --> 22:36.316
Uh, squared.

22:36.316 --> 22:39.956
You said...he couldn't.

22:39.956 --> 22:41.956
He genuinely didn't think he could.

22:41.956 --> 22:43.116
OK, but still...

22:43.116 --> 22:46.596
No, Dinah.
I only slept with one man last year,

22:46.596 --> 22:47.836
and that was Dennis.

22:53.396 --> 22:54.396
OK.

22:55.956 --> 22:58.596
I'll be seeing you both
in about a month.

23:10.162 --> 23:11.802
And I fucked the case, haven't I?

23:13.682 --> 23:15.082
Just wish you'd told us.

23:15.082 --> 23:16.602
I was scared, all right?

23:16.602 --> 23:20.802
You do this job, you live like I
have, and then you judge me.

23:20.802 --> 23:22.482
Yeah. Sorry.

23:22.482 --> 23:23.642
What did Viv say?

23:26.362 --> 23:28.402
She wants you in with her.

23:28.402 --> 23:30.242
Get Dennis to turn.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.722
No. No way. No. The idea is,
when I'm done, I'm gone.

23:32.722 --> 23:34.802
That's the whole point of
being undercover.

23:34.802 --> 23:37.642
Yeah, well, you kind of fucked the
whole point with his kid,

23:37.642 --> 23:39.002
didn't you? But I can't!

23:39.002 --> 23:41.922
After everything I've done to him,
I can't face him.

23:41.922 --> 23:43.802
- She needs you.
- But I can't!

23:46.002 --> 23:47.842
For Joy.

23:47.842 --> 23:48.922
One last time.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.162
Echo Tango Two to Control.

23:54.162 --> 23:55.722
We'll take it.

23:55.722 --> 23:56.882
Suspected vandalism?

23:56.882 --> 23:59.322
Oh come on, that's like, so boring.

23:59.322 --> 24:00.202
Where's the action?

24:00.202 --> 24:01.642
Yeah, well, it's a quiet day.

24:01.642 --> 24:04.882
Look, the deal was I get to hang out
with you guys and do a bunch

24:04.882 --> 24:06.882
of cool shit which I can tell
everyone about.

24:06.882 --> 24:08.122
Like a bank robbery

24:08.122 --> 24:10.242
or watch some dude choke to death on
his own vomit.

24:10.242 --> 24:12.162
I'm sure... Just...

24:12.162 --> 24:14.642
...something will turn up.

24:14.642 --> 24:16.042
It had better.

24:16.042 --> 24:18.042
Otherwise, the deal's off.

24:18.042 --> 24:22.562
Now, come on - I want top speed,
lights, sirens.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.642
Come on!

24:29.322 --> 24:31.602
Yes, darling, I'm looking at
one of yours now -

24:31.602 --> 24:33.882
A crime against carpentry
called the Banley.

24:33.882 --> 24:36.322
Straw underneath,
dead body on top, strike a match,

24:36.322 --> 24:37.722
it'd come into its own.

24:37.722 --> 24:40.922
What the buffalo it's doing in
anyone's parlour, though...

24:40.922 --> 24:45.602
Yeah, so, wholesale and any import
on that, what we looking at?

24:45.602 --> 24:47.402
Nine?

24:47.402 --> 24:50.522
What, you mean 9,000,
don't you?

24:50.522 --> 24:52.562
What?

24:52.562 --> 24:57.442
And your Drakefield, the one with
the interesting mottled cushion -

24:57.442 --> 25:00.802
looks like a football team's played
spunky biscuit on it?

25:00.802 --> 25:03.082
That's even less? Give over, madam.

25:10.002 --> 25:11.162
He can't hurt you.

25:12.642 --> 25:16.602
He'll try and throw some shit at you
but that's all he can do.

25:18.242 --> 25:20.842
You're stronger than him.

25:20.842 --> 25:22.162
OK.

25:37.322 --> 25:38.762
The baby's yours.

25:38.762 --> 25:41.362
Yeah, right, fuck off!
They haven't even taken a sample.

25:41.362 --> 25:42.922
We only needed the mother's blood.

25:42.922 --> 25:45.402
And your DNA's already
in our system.

25:45.402 --> 25:47.402
"Our"?

25:47.402 --> 25:48.562
Was any of it real?

25:48.562 --> 25:50.682
The sex was, obviously.

25:50.682 --> 25:52.082
Mummy.

26:02.802 --> 26:04.922
Who does this?

26:04.922 --> 26:07.682
Who sends employees out to
fuck the enemy?

26:07.682 --> 26:09.722
The original Nazis
prompted the idea.

26:09.722 --> 26:11.922
Same tricks apply to tribute bands,
apparently.

26:11.922 --> 26:14.482
Nobody gave me those instructions.
It was my choice.

26:14.482 --> 26:16.362
Shucks, I'm flattered. You cunt!

26:16.362 --> 26:18.442
Fuck off! Ah-ah-ah.

26:18.442 --> 26:20.082
Cosy chat is over.

26:20.082 --> 26:21.562
Where's Beckett?

26:21.562 --> 26:22.962
I want another lawyer.

26:22.962 --> 26:24.122
Well, what can you afford?

26:24.122 --> 26:25.602
Duty lawyer's fine.

26:25.602 --> 26:28.082
I just need an injunction
to stop an abortion.

26:28.082 --> 26:30.122
Pissed right on your chips,
there, Bonnie.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.722
I'll make you live with it
FOR THE REST OF YOUR FUCKING LIFE.

26:32.722 --> 26:35.282
I've no intention of getting an
abortion, Dennis.

26:37.242 --> 26:39.042
Permission to step out, Ma'am.

26:39.042 --> 26:40.522
Granted.

26:43.522 --> 26:44.842
Dirkin's dead.

26:44.842 --> 26:48.242
Who else might Beckett be
talking to, eh? Caroline McCoy?

26:48.242 --> 26:50.322
No idea, I've never met the woman.

26:50.322 --> 26:51.842
Well, did Dirkin ever mention her?

26:51.842 --> 26:53.762
Faye was sure you were the mole.

26:53.762 --> 26:56.242
I told her shut up or fuck off,

26:56.242 --> 26:59.122
which she wouldn't, so
YOUSE LOT FRAMED HER!

26:59.122 --> 27:01.842
Oh, grow up, Dennis - you're getting
flashbacks to Night Manager.

27:01.842 --> 27:04.442
Your sister is banged up
on solid evidence.

27:04.442 --> 27:05.802
Now, look at me!

27:05.802 --> 27:08.522
We desperately need to get
Joseph Beckett off the streets.

27:08.522 --> 27:10.722
That's been your only job since
he went apeshit.

27:10.722 --> 27:12.202
Yeah, well, someone is hiding him.

27:12.202 --> 27:13.442
Check my pockets.

27:14.722 --> 27:19.602
Once he finds out that Bonnie was
undercover, he'll go after her, too.

27:19.602 --> 27:21.162
No?

27:21.162 --> 27:23.082
Or maybe you'd love that.

27:27.242 --> 27:29.202
No, I don't want to talk to my mum.

27:29.202 --> 27:30.242
I need Stuart.

27:30.242 --> 27:33.002
Can't you get him on the
radio or something?

27:33.002 --> 27:34.922
Tess?

27:34.922 --> 27:37.002
You all right, love? Yeah, fine.

27:38.162 --> 27:40.362
I just wanted to see how Stu was.

27:40.362 --> 27:42.082
- Stuart?
- Yeah.

27:42.082 --> 27:45.882
He was helping me out with a thing,
but it's no big deal, honestly.

27:45.882 --> 27:46.962
Hold on.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.082
What's going on?

27:52.122 --> 27:54.042
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:56.922 --> 27:57.962
Come on.

27:59.842 --> 28:00.922
I screwed up.

28:02.482 --> 28:03.522
Happy now?

28:06.042 --> 28:07.642
Come upstairs.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.082
Take her upstairs.

28:11.602 --> 28:14.922
No offence, you guys,
but your job is seriously dull.

28:14.922 --> 28:17.202
It'd better be better tomorrow
or the deal's off.

28:17.202 --> 28:19.122
I mean, you guys are OK.

28:19.122 --> 28:20.642
Especially you, Tegan.

28:21.842 --> 28:23.602
- You got a boyfriend?
- Yeah, she has.

28:24.642 --> 28:26.402
Him?

28:26.402 --> 28:28.762
Oh, come on, Tegan, you could do so
much better than that.

28:28.762 --> 28:31.042
You know, after today,
I'm not sure that I disagree.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.242
- Right? Yeah? Yeah?
- Who's that?

28:35.722 --> 28:37.322
Oh, shit. Dad.

28:37.322 --> 28:38.642
It was just a weekend.

28:38.642 --> 28:42.122
It was just two nights away with
your mother and you do this.

28:42.122 --> 28:44.322
I'm used to my son's antics.

28:44.322 --> 28:46.082
Should almost have expected it.

28:46.082 --> 28:48.922
After all, he is a fucking moron.

28:48.922 --> 28:50.802
But, as far as I understand it,

28:50.802 --> 28:53.962
you came to the house and you just
let the carnage carry on.

28:53.962 --> 28:57.162
This was a civil matter -
it wasn't our business to intervene.

28:57.162 --> 28:59.762
Young people
drinking and taking drugs?

28:59.762 --> 29:01.362
No, sir, we didn't see any drugs.

29:01.362 --> 29:03.722
Did you see any drugs, Gabriel?

29:03.722 --> 29:04.962
I think I...

29:06.842 --> 29:08.002
I-I...

29:08.002 --> 29:09.042
Sorry.

29:10.922 --> 29:13.082
Anyone understand that?

29:13.082 --> 29:16.442
I spent thousands on his education.
What have I got? A gibbering idiot.

29:16.442 --> 29:18.042
Mr Turner, I called you because...

29:18.042 --> 29:20.562
Truth is, your two buddies here
fucked up and you want to me

29:20.562 --> 29:21.882
to control my son.

29:21.882 --> 29:24.882
No, no, no. We can do this formally,
if you prefer.

29:24.882 --> 29:28.682
Tess can be arrested. I'll make sure she's
interviewed by an independent investigator,

29:28.682 --> 29:30.522
show no bias. Yeah. Hm.

29:30.522 --> 29:31.882
Good.

29:31.882 --> 29:34.562
Her lawyer will argue that your
son's phone recording

29:34.562 --> 29:36.442
shows no dealing.

29:37.522 --> 29:40.162
Were there any drugs recovered
from the party, Stuart?

29:40.162 --> 29:41.402
No.

29:41.402 --> 29:44.002
No. OK. That's what we'll do,
no problem. OK.

29:45.242 --> 29:50.242
Obviously, to prove no bias,
we'd need to arrest Gabriel.

29:50.242 --> 29:51.562
What?

29:51.562 --> 29:54.842
Yeah, for being concerned in the
unlawful supply of controlled drugs.

29:54.842 --> 29:57.562
And aiding and abetting unlawful
sexual intercourse

29:57.562 --> 30:00.242
by providing the premises
for such actions to occur.

30:04.802 --> 30:06.522
Bit of a smarty pants, aren't you?

30:06.522 --> 30:10.442
We would have to inform social
services that this young man

30:10.442 --> 30:13.762
was regularly left alone and able
to organise these parties

30:13.762 --> 30:16.682
because his parents couldn't control
him...due to their

30:16.682 --> 30:18.682
- constant absence from his life.
- Hm.

30:21.002 --> 30:24.522
Or we could all agree that this is
just something that has been

30:24.522 --> 30:27.922
dealt with, no further action
needs to be taken by either side.

30:27.922 --> 30:29.002
What do you think, sir?

30:35.122 --> 30:36.722
Give me the phone. Let me see it.

30:45.082 --> 30:48.002
I don't know.
It's not very clear, is it?

30:55.762 --> 30:56.962
I tell you what...

30:58.682 --> 31:00.802
...let's ask the new mayor, shall we?

31:00.802 --> 31:04.522
Let's send her this, see what SHE
thinks.

31:04.522 --> 31:07.402
Her whole campaign was about the
police after all.

31:10.682 --> 31:14.322
Just so we're being...thorough,
eh, son?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.322
OK.

31:22.322 --> 31:24.882
Charge me with accessory.

31:24.882 --> 31:26.242
That's seven years, right?

31:26.242 --> 31:27.842
I can do that if I have to,

31:27.842 --> 31:30.402
but my chances at a trial
are better than good.

31:30.402 --> 31:32.402
I was accessory only to a stunt.

31:32.402 --> 31:34.442
With a live firearm that killed
one of my officers.

31:34.442 --> 31:36.802
Which I presumed was fake,
cos it was a stunt.

31:36.802 --> 31:39.042
Any decent jury's going to laugh
you out the dock.

31:39.042 --> 31:41.882
So, worst case, three-and-a-half
with good behaviour.

31:41.882 --> 31:44.322
- Then I pick up where I left off.
- Left off what?

31:44.322 --> 31:46.322
The kid.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.482
The kid?

31:47.482 --> 31:50.002
I'll have either been acquitted or
I'll have served my time.

31:50.002 --> 31:53.322
So, by laws and decency,
I'm entitled to access.

31:53.322 --> 31:54.802
She was an undercover officer.

31:54.802 --> 31:57.362
We don't even know her real name.

31:57.362 --> 32:00.682
It's her job to vanish again
until the bat phone goes.

32:00.682 --> 32:04.002
We didn't know her before this.
We won't see her again.

32:04.002 --> 32:06.522
I want to see Bonnie.

32:06.522 --> 32:09.442
She's being de-briefed
before leaving.

32:09.442 --> 32:12.322
You're not the only ones
with facial recognition software.

32:12.322 --> 32:14.722
And yet, she got past your vetting
to end up in bed.

32:18.322 --> 32:19.602
Bonnie!

32:19.602 --> 32:21.482
She's not here.

32:21.482 --> 32:22.562
She's off the case.

32:22.562 --> 32:24.002
She has filed her last report.

32:24.002 --> 32:25.282
We never met.

32:29.962 --> 32:31.762
Now...

32:31.762 --> 32:34.722
...you let me know

32:34.722 --> 32:36.802
when you want to
talk about Beckett.

32:45.202 --> 32:48.042
This is such a fucked-up case.

32:48.042 --> 32:49.562
You are such a fucked-up case.

32:50.922 --> 32:54.722
I'll get pro bono,
just for the coverage!

32:54.722 --> 32:56.922
YOU FUCKING...

32:56.922 --> 32:59.522
Right, call in the boys,
let's get him back in his cell.

32:59.522 --> 33:01.722
No, wait. That's my child!
Put an end to this.

33:01.722 --> 33:04.682
You can't fucking do this.
There are laws!

33:04.682 --> 33:07.482
We're not going to catch Beckett if
he's rolled up in a foetal ball,

33:07.482 --> 33:09.002
shitting himself without nappies.

33:09.002 --> 33:10.402
THIS IS INHUMAN!

33:10.402 --> 33:12.602
He's nowhere to go after
"inhuman" but, honest, wait.

33:12.602 --> 33:14.122
No, I'm stopping this.

33:22.562 --> 33:24.162
Oops.

33:24.162 --> 33:27.882
Difference between us - if I don't
invoice, I'm not responsible.

33:35.372 --> 33:36.572
A settee? A sodding settee?

33:36.572 --> 33:38.412
Why are we talking interior
design, Miller?

33:38.412 --> 33:40.492
Yeah, apologies for milking this -

33:40.492 --> 33:43.012
I am presently tumescent
with smugness.

33:43.012 --> 33:46.732
Dirkin, he has three poncey bespoke
sofas adorning his molly house

33:46.732 --> 33:49.092
and these fellas - well,
not knowing their own strength,

33:49.092 --> 33:51.292
they've done gone and flipped one
over during gunfight

33:51.292 --> 33:55.372
at the Alt Right orgy -
vouchsafing unto my keen senses -

33:55.372 --> 34:00.252
a little metal disc on the chassis,
bearing the initials "MFS".

34:00.252 --> 34:01.452
McCoy's Furniture Store.

34:01.452 --> 34:02.852
McCoy as in Caroline McCoy.

34:02.852 --> 34:05.372
Caroline McCoy,
the newly elected mayor.

34:05.372 --> 34:07.732
All this is tales of the fucking
obvious, I know,

34:07.732 --> 34:09.532
but it is not the thing.
The thing is,

34:09.532 --> 34:12.292
Dirkin has shelled 17 grand
apiece for these.

34:12.292 --> 34:16.292
That is - a 51k hand shandy on some
frankly very average buffets

34:16.292 --> 34:18.891
that retail normally
eight thou tops.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.411
Now where's the other 43 gone?

34:20.411 --> 34:22.732
Right into Caroline McCoy's
campaign fund.

34:22.732 --> 34:25.371
They're money laundering
for England and the commonwealth.

34:25.371 --> 34:28.252
Now we have the start of a paper
trail linking Caroline to Dirkin.

34:28.252 --> 34:31.331
We just need time and some deep
forensic accounting.

34:31.331 --> 34:32.812
You keep digging, Miller.

34:32.812 --> 34:35.492
You just made my Christmas
card list.

34:35.492 --> 34:37.092
Just heard from the FME.

34:37.092 --> 34:39.772
Dennis is conscious,
injuries are all superficial.

34:39.772 --> 34:41.092
We're good to go.

34:41.092 --> 34:42.212
KNOCK AT DOOR

34:43.252 --> 34:44.732
Can I just have a word, Ma'am?

34:52.772 --> 34:53.772
What you done?

34:55.292 --> 34:59.972
Well, the short version is...that
I think I'm about to get sacked.

34:59.972 --> 35:02.132
So's Stuart and Tegan.

35:02.132 --> 35:04.612
Probably you, as well, Dinah.

35:04.612 --> 35:05.852
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

35:09.012 --> 35:11.532
You'd best not be taking the piss
about vegetarian.

35:11.532 --> 35:12.932
Boss sent me nearly half a mile

35:12.932 --> 35:15.732
cos she doesn't trust canteen
with beef dripping.

35:15.732 --> 35:18.652
Oh, Jesus, Bonnie, no!
Who's seen you?

35:18.652 --> 35:20.892
Nobody. Please, Jonah,
I've gotta go soon.

35:20.892 --> 35:23.292
It's my job, if I don't report this.

35:23.292 --> 35:25.452
Well, it's not busy,
from here to Deering's office,

35:25.452 --> 35:27.332
could you make that take you
two minutes?

35:28.932 --> 35:30.492
It normally takes three.

35:32.132 --> 35:33.572
I'm locking you in.

35:33.572 --> 35:35.012
Make your own excuses.

35:38.012 --> 35:41.372
I'm not saying goodbyes to anyone
else, Dennis, I never do.

35:41.372 --> 35:45.372
Can you just do this?
Like a fucking grasshopper?

35:45.372 --> 35:48.252
Just reboot somewhere else
with a clean slate?

35:49.612 --> 35:50.652
"Clean!"

35:52.412 --> 35:54.052
I could kill you right now.

35:55.092 --> 35:57.572
You'd be dead before they got near.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.932
You wanted to know which bits
of me were real.

35:59.932 --> 36:01.412
I don't care any more.

36:01.412 --> 36:04.172
Then it doesn't matter where I'm
relocated for my next assignment.

36:04.172 --> 36:07.252
Tell me you're not working cases
like this till you get maternity?!

36:07.252 --> 36:08.532
Cases like what?

36:08.532 --> 36:09.572
Scabby shit.

36:09.572 --> 36:11.492
At four months pregnant!

36:12.652 --> 36:15.292
As it turns out, I'm nearly five...

36:15.292 --> 36:17.492
...and I do know the sex.

36:17.492 --> 36:19.652
I didn't ask,
I was told accidentally.

36:21.932 --> 36:23.532
It's a boy, Dennis.

36:32.292 --> 36:33.892
That's Jonah.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.972
Deering's onto me.

36:36.732 --> 36:38.132
Dennis, look at me.

36:39.892 --> 36:43.132
I got lost in the middle
of pretending.

36:43.132 --> 36:44.612
I don't know who said this,

36:44.612 --> 36:48.492
but they reckon your child can be
two and a half times what you are.

36:48.492 --> 36:51.092
Fuck's sake,
Bonnie, don't tell me that!

36:53.492 --> 36:57.412
Your decision as to whether that's
for better or worse.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.092
They'll suspend me for this.

37:02.092 --> 37:03.212
For this?!

37:04.492 --> 37:06.172
Who gives a shit?

37:06.172 --> 37:08.132
She already knows I'm here, anyway.

37:08.132 --> 37:12.252
This piece of work actually knows
things before she's told it, so...

37:12.252 --> 37:16.412
I banked 176 days overtime.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.572
Well, no, 177 now.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.772
So, they'd be doing me a favour.

37:22.772 --> 37:25.372
Overtime on me?

37:25.372 --> 37:26.692
Yeah!

37:30.932 --> 37:32.732
How can this work, Bonnie?

37:35.092 --> 37:36.852
Make your own choices.

37:38.452 --> 37:40.572
I won't be stupid about this.

37:40.572 --> 37:41.772
I can wait.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.652
I can't.

37:45.652 --> 37:49.092
If you do what they say,
if you help them, then, who knows?

37:50.852 --> 37:53.532
Whether they say they'll
let you go or not,

37:53.532 --> 37:55.972
I wouldn't trust a word of
without it in writing.

37:57.172 --> 37:59.372
You may owe Beckett your life,

37:59.372 --> 38:03.292
but it's up to you whether you let
him keep taking others...

38:06.452 --> 38:08.732
...and he really scares me, Dennis.

38:22.412 --> 38:24.132
Got him. Good girl.

38:24.132 --> 38:25.092
Viv, really?

38:25.092 --> 38:26.932
What did you think of my
performance, Ma'am?

38:26.932 --> 38:29.532
My old drama teacher said I was the
finest Bottom he'd ever seen.

38:29.532 --> 38:32.092
- That's the go-to line before you get
fingered. - That's enough.

38:32.092 --> 38:33.732
Have you been boozing?

38:33.732 --> 38:34.772
Viv...

38:34.772 --> 38:37.452
Ma'am, have you had a chance to
think about what we're gonna do yet?

38:37.452 --> 38:38.732
I heard the mayor rang.

38:38.732 --> 38:41.212
Fuck the mayor.
I need to talk to you. Now.

38:41.212 --> 38:42.452
You can't let them go.

38:42.452 --> 38:44.572
Not in their present
mental capacity.

38:44.572 --> 38:45.852
Yeah, all right.

38:45.852 --> 38:47.932
Dennis is a little bit fragile -

38:47.932 --> 38:50.372
but Bonnie's handling him now,
and she's a pro.

38:50.372 --> 38:52.372
Yeah, a real pro
who let herself get pregnant.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.572
Well, that's an accident.

38:53.572 --> 38:56.092
I spend all day, every day
listening to people lie to me,

38:56.092 --> 38:59.012
and what I heard in that cell,
the way Bonnie was talking,

38:59.012 --> 39:01.492
that came from a deep place
within her, and it was true.

39:01.492 --> 39:04.012
I have absolutely no idea
where her head is at right now.

39:04.012 --> 39:07.132
Are you going to pay any attention
to what Peep's just told you?

39:13.092 --> 39:14.772
I turned Dennis.

39:14.772 --> 39:16.732
After one nod in a cell?

39:16.732 --> 39:19.252
If you let them out you are gonna
be fishing Bonnie's body

39:19.252 --> 39:20.772
out of the canal within the hour -

39:20.772 --> 39:23.452
and that's not even the half of it.

39:23.452 --> 39:25.932
Oh, I kept meaning to come
and talk to you about that.

39:25.932 --> 39:27.372
Mayor's on her way in.

39:27.372 --> 39:30.132
Needs to talk urgently about alleged
corruption in my department.

39:30.132 --> 39:31.772
That's code for "I want you out".

39:31.772 --> 39:33.012
I'll think of something.

39:33.012 --> 39:35.372
Oh, you love all this off-the-cuff
policing, don't you?

39:35.372 --> 39:36.812
I have to win.

39:37.772 --> 39:38.932
For Joy.

39:39.852 --> 39:41.732
So, today - just today, mind -

39:41.732 --> 39:44.852
you've risked the life of an
undercover officer

39:44.852 --> 39:48.572
by blowing her cover without
consultation or approval,

39:48.572 --> 39:51.732
you've interviewed a prisoner
without a lawyer

39:51.732 --> 39:53.572
or any recording device
contrary to PACE,

39:53.572 --> 39:55.732
and then incited him to
violence and self-harm -

39:55.732 --> 39:58.732
and all the while, officers
under your charge

39:58.732 --> 40:01.212
were deliberately burying evidence
about drug dealing

40:01.212 --> 40:03.732
because the accused is the
daughter of a colleague.

40:03.732 --> 40:05.452
You really feel like
you're winning, Viv?

40:05.452 --> 40:06.452
I'm still standing.

40:06.452 --> 40:08.932
And when Caroline comes and
she gets just a sniff of this -

40:08.932 --> 40:10.692
how long before
you're out of the door?

40:13.132 --> 40:15.732
Do you think she's worked out
you're onto her?

40:16.852 --> 40:18.412
Yes, Ma'am.

40:18.412 --> 40:22.612
So she's gonna use this Tessa
business to get rid of everyone.

40:22.612 --> 40:25.612
She'll be mayor, there'll be two
uncontrollable psychopaths

40:25.612 --> 40:27.012
on the street and no police.

40:27.012 --> 40:28.092
Winning?

40:28.092 --> 40:30.972
You're not even fighting, Viv.
You're drowning.

40:32.252 --> 40:33.292
You're right.

40:35.892 --> 40:38.532
There is only one way to fix this.

40:38.532 --> 40:40.372
You'll have to resign.

40:40.372 --> 40:41.652
Wait, what?

40:41.652 --> 40:44.092
She needs a senior officer to go,
like you said.

40:44.092 --> 40:47.532
That way we can keep on
investigating her.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.452
Take the blame -
your watch, your officers.

40:50.452 --> 40:52.212
Wipe the slate clean.

40:52.212 --> 40:53.692
What do you say?

40:53.692 --> 40:55.812
I say you stuff it up your arse.

41:05.092 --> 41:07.772
If anyone does any digging,
this'll all seem kosher.

41:10.332 --> 41:12.132
You know what's next?

41:12.132 --> 41:15.492
We'll arrange a secure location,
somewhere we can control.

41:15.492 --> 41:17.572
You'll contact Beckett when
the time is right,

41:17.572 --> 41:19.212
arrange the meet,
and we'll have him.

41:37.012 --> 41:38.372
Dinah.

41:38.372 --> 41:39.452
Hi, Mum.

41:39.452 --> 41:41.532
Got your messages. What's up?

41:42.732 --> 41:44.812
It's the mayor. Go, go, go.

41:44.812 --> 41:45.852
Wait over there.

41:51.652 --> 41:55.092
Madam Mayor!
Hello. The DI's expecting you.

41:55.092 --> 41:57.852
Is she? Great. Hiya, Dinah.

41:57.852 --> 42:00.332
- You all right?
- Madam Mayor. Congratulations.

42:00.332 --> 42:01.572
Thanks, hon.

42:01.572 --> 42:03.572
You look knackered.

42:03.572 --> 42:04.612
Cheers.

42:06.132 --> 42:07.132
This way.

42:08.652 --> 42:10.012
I'm sorry, all right?

42:10.012 --> 42:12.772
I'll never do it again,
never do anything like it, I swear.

42:12.772 --> 42:14.092
I'm gonna lose my job.

42:15.492 --> 42:17.532
So's Viv, so are half my mates.

42:17.532 --> 42:18.572
But that's not fair.

42:18.572 --> 42:20.092
Well, that's the way it is.

42:20.092 --> 42:21.732
So I'm glad you've learned
your lesson.

42:21.732 --> 42:23.532
- You're such a bitch.
- You what?!

42:23.532 --> 42:25.492
All you ever think about
is your job.

42:25.492 --> 42:28.092
- I do it for you. It pays the bills.
- Bullshit.

42:28.092 --> 42:31.852
Work's just your excuse to stay away
from us all isn't it?

42:31.852 --> 42:34.612
Joy said that you were incredible.

42:34.612 --> 42:36.572
She said that I should never get
cross with you,

42:36.572 --> 42:39.412
no matter what you did, because you
were the best person in the world.

42:41.452 --> 42:43.572
But I've never seen it.

42:43.572 --> 42:46.492
Because you save it for work,
don't you?

42:48.612 --> 42:51.492
Look, Mum, I'm really, really
sorry for what I did.

42:51.492 --> 42:53.132
I am.

42:58.372 --> 42:59.412
But, please...

43:02.212 --> 43:04.092
...come home now.

43:05.572 --> 43:06.732
I will.

43:08.292 --> 43:09.652
In a bit.

43:16.372 --> 43:17.572
Tess...

43:19.972 --> 43:21.692
I'm trying.

43:22.732 --> 43:24.052
I swear.

43:32.732 --> 43:33.772
Madam Mayor.

43:33.772 --> 43:36.332
Don't be daft, Viv -
I'm here as a friend.

43:41.732 --> 43:43.732
Now would you like a drink?

43:43.732 --> 43:47.012
If I'm honest,
I think we both might need one.

43:48.292 --> 43:51.492
Do you know, the worst thing about
the journey here

43:51.492 --> 43:53.172
was going over it again and again,

43:53.172 --> 43:55.972
and it coming out worse
for us all every time,

43:55.972 --> 43:58.012
and not being able to see a
way around it.

43:58.012 --> 43:59.372
Well, it's a good job I can.

44:00.452 --> 44:01.892
I'm resigning.

44:01.892 --> 44:03.932
I've written to the Chief Constable

44:03.932 --> 44:06.092
and I'll be gone
by the end of the week.

44:06.092 --> 44:08.132
I take full responsibility
for it all.

44:19.572 --> 44:23.852
Detective Chief Inspector Terry
Taylor is just the man for the job.

44:23.852 --> 44:26.132
God, look at her.
Like butter wouldn't melt.

44:27.187 --> 44:29.547
There's been a complaint of
misconduct made against you.

44:29.572 --> 44:30.972
- By who?
- Inspector Deering.

44:30.972 --> 44:33.452
At the risk of going all Lion King
on you, we keep the circle.

44:33.452 --> 44:34.452
Ma'am.

44:34.452 --> 44:37.372
If Terry-dactyl gets a whiff that
we're onto McCoy, it's game over.

44:37.372 --> 44:38.732
Deering doesn't know he's here.

44:38.732 --> 44:39.772
Or does she?

44:39.772 --> 44:42.532
I can't think straight knowing that
maniac's still out there.

44:42.532 --> 44:44.652
There's no need to go all
Witches of Eastwick on me.

44:44.652 --> 44:46.732
If you get Beckett -
be the making of you.

44:46.732 --> 44:49.132
Bet you wish you'd shot
the bitch dead.

44:49.132 --> 44:51.572
All officers - to Sinderley market.

44:52.892 --> 44:55.252
Vivienne - this cannot go wrong.

44:55.252 --> 44:56.852
Stuart!
