01:09.695 --> 01:11.857
I am so sorry, Ron.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.689
I had a last-minute DJ
set at the Rockfish,

01:14.908 --> 01:17.776

promoter kept yelling at me.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.282
Yvonne, clearly you like
drama, so how about this?

01:20.497 --> 01:22.614
Keep this up, and you're
fired. Dramatic enough?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.206
It's okay, Ron.
I've got it.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.458

01:27.629 --> 01:28.540
Thanks, Joel.

- Don't worry, I'll talk to Ron.

Joel, you're the best.

Yeah. I remember everything.

Good luck topping this one.

Maybe because it is.

So, uh, maybe now that
this is a thing,

04:09.166 --> 04:12.830

a small stroke, or...

Ravi soaked it in some blue

was fun for a while, but...

04:41.573 --> 04:44.657

of death was electrocution.

05:01.885 --> 05:02.716
Suicide?

05:02.928 --> 05:03.884
Nope.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.963
Look. There's a piece
broken off the dryer,

05:07.182 --> 05:09.765
and there's a chipped tile,
here.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.468
Small piece of the hair

05:13.396 --> 05:14.682

Someone threw it in.
Probably from around here.

- COP 2: And I got it, what's your point?

05:20.612 --> 05:23.355
- COP 1: The point is it's garbage!
- What the hell's going on?

05:23.573 --> 05:26.862
We found it in the trash. The
baseball signed by Thurman Munson.

- No. Bag it and log it.

That's what
I told him, Detective.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.702

She's ready to talk to you.

05:38.630 --> 05:39.996
So Barb, you found the body?

05:40.215 --> 05:42.172
Yes. I was at my
boyfriend's last night

05:42.384 --> 05:44.717
and when I got back this
morning I found her like that.

05:44.928 --> 05:45.918
Had you known her long?

05:46.137 --> 05:47.298
A year.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.675
I met her on Craigslist.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.054
I inherited the house from my
grandfather and rented out the spare room.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.558
There were no signs of forced
entry, she likely knew her killer.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.938
You know her friends?
Boyfriends?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.557
No. I'm a homebody.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.480
She was
a party-all-night type.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.486
She was always wrapped up
in some drama or whatever...

06:05.198 --> 06:06.405
You saw her room?

06:11.872 --> 06:12.953
Bit of a mess.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.122
That's what she was...

06:15.333 --> 06:16.574
A hot mess.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.750
Sounds like
it could be exhausting.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.328
Sometimes, kinda.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.914
Yeah, she was messy,
self-centered, dramatic,

06:23.133 --> 06:25.216
kinda scatterbrained,
usually late with rent.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.215

11:09.085 --> 11:10.951
Hey bro,

11:11.171 --> 11:12.628
I'm trying to run a club here.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.330
Vibe matters,

11:14.549 --> 11:17.292
and this is not a good vibe.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.671
- What can I get you?
- I'm fine.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.095
C'mon. On the house.
Anything. What do you want?

11:21.306 --> 11:22.467
To be human again.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.548
Well, things are
tough all over.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.216
Not entirely.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.520
My dad owns an airline,

11:29.731 --> 11:32.098
and my trust fund
kicked in last year.

11:32.734 --> 11:36.444
I can get you $1,000,000,000
in cash. Now.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.565
For a cure.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.316
Yes!

11:42.535 --> 11:43.901
Back in the club.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.912
Liv, I get you're
on this crazy brain,

11:47.415 --> 11:49.247
but don't forget
we're police on the job.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.666
No problemo.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.828
I should probably take the lead on
this, right? Since it's more my scene?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.084
- Not really.
- I think this is our guy.

11:56.299 --> 11:59.212
Are you Sage Denning?
The owner?

11:59.427 --> 12:02.340
- Mr. Grumpy at the front bar said we could find you here.
- Yeah?

12:02.513 --> 12:05.221
Liv? You might remember me,
I used to come here?

12:05.433 --> 12:06.469

12:06.684 --> 12:09.301
- Uh...
- Oh, also, we're the police.

Seattle PD.

Homicide.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.816
We're investigating the
murder of Yvonne Fallon.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.485
Yeah. We heard about that.
Terrible.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.857
So she was DJing here?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.530
Yeah.
Off and on.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.858
I just hired her. My wife, she
handles the day to day stuff.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.490
She could probably tell
you more about her. Trish!

12:26.704 --> 12:28.696
There's some cops
here about that DJ.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.330
Trish!

12:30.875 --> 12:32.491
Hmm.
Let me text her.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.493
LIV: Who's that?

12:34.712 --> 12:36.499
I'll bet he remembers me.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.125
That's our head
bartender, Nels.

12:38.341 --> 12:41.209
The DJ stand's back there, so he probably
hung out with her more than anyone.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.168
Trish says we're out
of Sambuca,

12:43.388 --> 12:44.469
she went out for more.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.014
I'll question Nels.
Wish me luck.

12:47.684 --> 12:48.765
Why?

12:48.977 --> 12:50.058
I'm usually pretty busy
back here,

12:50.270 --> 12:51.806
So I can't really tell
you much about her.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.387
There must be something.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.140
She was annoying,
she was always flirting,

12:57.110 --> 12:58.146
always playing
some sort of angle.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.569
It felt like she was hosting
"The Yvonne Show." or something...

13:00.780 --> 13:01.770
Pepper vodka?

13:01.990 --> 13:03.481
Do a shot with me!

13:03.700 --> 13:06.067
It'll loosen you up.
C'mon.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.118
By order of Seattle PD.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.246
Nels, you seem
very perceptive.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.949
I'm perceptive, too, so I can
tell when other people are.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.662
Did you sense anything
about Yvonne? Trouble, or...

13:20.466 --> 13:22.958
You know what I sensed?
That she was a crap DJ.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.294
I DJ myself, so I know.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.879
I don't even know
how she got hired.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.930
You're a DJ, too?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.758
Okay, so here's
her check stubs.

Liv, what are you...

14:00.298 --> 14:01.459
Are you drinking?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.381
It's a questioning technique.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.466
Loosening him up,
forming a bond.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.260
That's not how we do things.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.338
I don't play
by the rules, Clive.

just hours before
she was murdered.

- And now you're hiding from police questioning.

15:07.990 --> 15:08.946
That's the big deal.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.571
Okay, yeah, I hid 'cause
I thought you'd recognized me,

15:11.786 --> 15:13.743
and I didn't want the hassle.
Okay? Satisfied?

15:13.955 --> 15:14.695
No.

She slept with my husband.

Not exactly. And it
wasn't a big deal, anyway.

qualifies as a "big deal."

is gonna vanish soon,

New Major being a real dick?

was pretentious in that way.

How much money?
What for?

21:19.445 --> 21:20.606
A thousand.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.733
She said she needed it.
I didn't ask her why.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.899
And she told you
she slept with Sage Denning?

21:25.117 --> 21:27.734
When I asked her who that
woman was who slapped her. Yeah.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.286
So you show up with the money
and a bottle of wine.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.781
You were expecting a little
something extra for your effort,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.616
- weren't you Joel?
- Wine?

21:34.835 --> 21:37.498
- What makes you think...
- We're detectives, Joel!

21:37.713 --> 21:39.124
We detect things!

21:39.507 --> 21:40.293
No joke.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.875
Does anyone have, like,
an aspirin or ibuprofin?

21:43.093 --> 21:44.379
As Ms. Moore was saying,

21:44.595 --> 21:46.882
it appears you were hoping for
something beyond friendship.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.840
You were totally into Yvonne,
but she friendzoned you.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.016
She wanted your money,
but she didn't want you.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.726
She didn't even
take the money.

21:54.063 --> 21:57.352
- Why not?
- I don't know, she just said she didn't need it.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.810
- Or me.
- Ugh. Nice creeps are the worst.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.190
- Men are garbage.
- Liv...

22:03.405 --> 22:04.987
Not you, Clive.

22:05.199 --> 22:07.065
You're the best.
You know that, right?

22:10.329 --> 22:11.661
(RINGING)

22:11.872 --> 22:13.955
<i>- This is Liv, leave me a message.
- (BEEPS)</i>

22:14.166 --> 22:16.123
Liv, it's Ravi.

22:16.335 --> 22:20.329
There's a sample tray at your
workstation with just a spleen in it.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.835
Maybe you know
who it belongs to.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.292
- Call me. Thank you.
- (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

22:26.679 --> 22:28.215
Hard at work.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.680
Same old Ravi.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.266
You don't look
happy to see me.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.936
I prefer non-alive guests here to
remain quietly on their shelves.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.264
Still got it.
King of the slams!

22:39.483 --> 22:41.145
If you're looking for brains,
I can't help you.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.191
Sorry, goodbye.

22:42.403 --> 22:46.943
Nothing so small-time. I'm bringing
you an amazing one-time deal.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.614
I've got a client
at my nightclub.

22:48.826 --> 22:51.193
Trust fund kid.
Loaded.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.369
Zombie life doesn't agree
with him and he's down.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.789
Moaning how he wishes
he had a cure...

22:56.000 --> 22:58.708
Okay, I see.
My answer is still...

22:58.961 --> 23:03.456
For one dose, he's offering
$100,000.

23:03.674 --> 23:04.710
We can split, 50-50.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.337
50K, that buys
a lot of...

23:08.178 --> 23:11.797
Sweaters, or whatever
it is you're into.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.133
What do you say?

23:14.351 --> 23:15.592
Same answer.

23:15.811 --> 23:16.642
No.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.811
It's not even
a functional cure.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.522
You know well as I do,
it's got serious side effects.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.397
What, like this "memory"
thing? That's a load of crap.

23:25.654 --> 23:26.565
What do you mean?

23:26.780 --> 23:28.988
I mean Blaine's faking.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.741
Why do you think that?

23:31.952 --> 23:33.238
I don't think it, I know it.

23:33.454 --> 23:34.444
Open your eyes.

23:34.663 --> 23:39.954
Blaine loses his memory and just
like that, all his problems are gone.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.377
He's got Mr. Boss
off his back,

23:42.588 --> 23:45.581
his brain business is raking in dough
since there's no cure for being a zombie,

23:45.799 --> 23:46.835
(CHUCKLES) and, oh...

23:47.051 --> 23:49.293
Now "clean slate,
nice guy Blaine"

23:49.511 --> 23:52.094
can put the moves
on that hot assistant D.A...

23:53.307 --> 23:56.926
Without having to answer
for his very shady past.

23:57.144 --> 24:00.137
Once, I heard him in
his office, on the phone.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.267
He said,

24:02.483 --> 24:05.442
"Relax, man,
you sound like John."

24:07.947 --> 24:10.530
John was this guy we used
to know. He worried a lot.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.567
He got murdered a year ago.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.403
How can Blaine
remember John

24:16.872 --> 24:18.283
if he has no memory?

24:18.499 --> 24:20.991
There's lots of people
named John.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.668
I mean, I know at least three.

24:23.879 --> 24:27.714
Clearly we run in different
circles, because I've only known one.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.257
And he worried a lot.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.504
But hey, I get it.

24:31.512 --> 24:32.719
Blaine's your buddy now.

24:33.222 --> 24:36.556
Keep it in mind.
50-50.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.145
<i>- This is Liv, leave me a message.
- (BEEPS)</i>

24:43.357 --> 24:44.564
<i>Voicemail full.</i>

24:44.733 --> 24:47.316
Voicemail full?
For God's sake, Liv...

24:48.320 --> 24:49.401
Uh, Ravi?

24:52.908 --> 24:54.900
Um, right here.

24:57.705 --> 24:58.491
Hey.

25:00.374 --> 25:04.163
So, I'm on the dominatrix case and
I only have a summary of the autopsy.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.411
Could I get a full report?

25:06.630 --> 25:08.087
Of course. Just, let me...

25:20.811 --> 25:22.768
So, um, Peyton. Actually...

25:26.400 --> 25:28.642
I... I heard something,

25:28.861 --> 25:32.571
that I feel I need to,
you know, pass along.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.239
It's about Blaine.

25:35.743 --> 25:36.608
What did you hear?

25:36.827 --> 25:39.285
That Blaine is faking
his memory loss

25:39.496 --> 25:41.613
as a way to leave
his problems behind.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.243
Get a new start.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.121
I wasn't going to say
anything, but...

25:47.921 --> 25:49.253
If it's true,

25:49.590 --> 25:51.752
then the cure works.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.375
And if the cure works,

25:53.594 --> 25:56.632
well, you know what that
would mean for Liv.

25:57.598 --> 25:58.714
Where'd you hear this?

25:58.932 --> 26:00.218
A guy, from Blaine's old crew.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.676
No doubt a paragon
of honesty and integrity.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.511
I know how this sounds.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.812
I thought about
not even telling you, but...

26:07.024 --> 26:08.140
You should've
stuck with that.

26:09.818 --> 26:12.652
I just, thought
you should hear.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.395
And I did.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.149
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

26:18.577 --> 26:19.943
Nice guys are the worst.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.905
So, Sage was with you
until 2:00 a.m.?

26:24.124 --> 26:25.786
Got it.
Thank you, Jen.

26:26.168 --> 26:27.079
Bye.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.205
You know?

26:29.755 --> 26:32.418
- What?
- About these creepy nice guys.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.546
I need a wipe.
Do you have wipes?

26:35.719 --> 26:38.257
Wipes? No, Liv.
I'm trying to work.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.594
I know I have
my license here somewhere.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.637
Does a gym card count?

26:47.981 --> 26:49.188
Tell you what,
forget the license.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.432
We do this off the books, I'll
give you a grand for the ball.

26:51.777 --> 26:52.984
Otherwise, better
luck next life.

26:53.904 --> 26:54.940
(GASPS)

26:58.117 --> 27:00.951
- Where'd you go?
- Happy Days Pawn Shop.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.244
She sold a baseball
for $1,000.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.242
The same amount
she asked Joel for.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.539
What else did you see?

27:08.210 --> 27:09.326
That wasn't enough?

27:12.965 --> 27:14.376
Finally.
You got the stuff?

27:14.591 --> 27:15.877
Yeah. Sorry,

27:16.093 --> 27:18.460
lots of detective stuff,
so it took a while.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.345
Wipes.

27:21.515 --> 27:23.427
The police place
is disgusting.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.637
Enhanced water.

27:26.395 --> 27:27.431
I got one for you, too.

27:28.105 --> 27:28.970
And...

27:30.232 --> 27:33.066
You forgot the ingredients
for the blue solution again.

27:33.235 --> 27:34.692
God, Liv...

27:34.862 --> 27:36.444
I am so sorry, Ravi.

27:36.655 --> 27:40.274
Clive's been so needy on this
case, He's just like, bleh...

27:40.868 --> 27:42.359
Why are you even here?

27:43.203 --> 27:44.785
Isn't it your shift
monitoring Major?

27:46.123 --> 27:48.331
- Liv.
- I had to come here.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.078
Clive needed me.

27:50.294 --> 27:51.535
I left Major my name

27:51.753 --> 27:54.712
and number and who I am,
if he's confused,

27:54.882 --> 27:57.420
and no new messages,
so he's probably fine.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.759
Your voicemail is full!

28:01.847 --> 28:02.883
He's not here.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.680
And his travel bag is gone.
He must've gone somewhere.

28:04.892 --> 28:06.383
- Where?
- He might not even know,

28:06.602 --> 28:08.764
his memory could be
totally gone by now.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.345
Okay. You're Major.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.146
Your memory is disappearing,
where do you go?

28:19.198 --> 28:20.405
- Bill?
- Hey, Dalia.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.191
Listen, we got a call from
the people at the bus depot.

28:23.410 --> 28:27.199
A young man was wandering around
with no belongings and no ID.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.781
Didn't seem to know
who or where he was.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.871
I went down to pick him up,
and, well,

28:33.879 --> 28:34.915
look who I found.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.381
Major?

28:47.809 --> 28:48.799
Hey there.

28:49.645 --> 28:50.556
Hey.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.345
Look!

28:52.564 --> 28:55.181
- You brought food!
- Hmm. I did.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.235
Thai me up, Thai me down.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.687
If you insist.

29:01.615 --> 29:04.153
Mind if I down some of this Pad Thai
first? I'm gonna need the energy.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.654
Hmm. Funny man.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.989
So I dropped by
the morgue today.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.245
I needed some information
on a case from Ravi.

29:13.627 --> 29:14.367
Yeah?

29:14.586 --> 29:18.796
Yeah. Uh, Ravi came at me with this
whole elaborate conspiracy theory

29:19.007 --> 29:21.966
that you've been faking your
memory loss this whole time.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.544
I'm starting to think
that guy has a crush on you.

29:25.389 --> 29:26.971
- What's his theory?
- I guess, one of your old

29:27.182 --> 29:28.593
running buddies
was in his ear.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.601
I didn't run with
a real trustworthy group.

29:32.813 --> 29:35.476
Yeah. He said you just wanted
to keep your business going

29:35.691 --> 29:37.557
and win me over.

29:37.859 --> 29:38.770
Hmm.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.319
Absurd, right?

29:41.697 --> 29:44.155
I mean, he knows what happened
to Major since he took the cure.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.404
You know what this needs?

29:49.371 --> 29:50.282
Pinot.

29:53.542 --> 29:54.874
Major took the cure?

29:56.795 --> 29:57.535
When?

29:58.046 --> 29:59.378
Couple days ago.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.752
Liv said his memory
has started fading.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.503
It's heartbreaking.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.380
Yeah... That's how it goes.

30:09.516 --> 30:10.597
Poor Major.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.689
So?

30:22.904 --> 30:23.690
So, what?

30:23.905 --> 30:25.237
It's not true, is it?

30:25.449 --> 30:26.360
No.

30:27.117 --> 30:29.530
I mean, I didn't even think
you expected an answer.

30:31.913 --> 30:32.949
Right.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.699
I mean, it doesn't even
matter anyway.

30:39.421 --> 30:40.537
What doesn't matter?

30:41.256 --> 30:42.918
It's just...
This is you, right?

30:43.759 --> 30:45.500
'Cause if this version
is the real you,

30:45.719 --> 30:47.381
then does it matter
how we got here?

30:47.596 --> 30:49.383
So even if I faked
losing my memory,

30:49.598 --> 30:51.385
you wouldn't be a little mad?

30:52.142 --> 30:53.098
I don't know.

30:53.769 --> 30:54.805
I'm just...

30:56.396 --> 30:57.728
I'm so happy right now.

30:58.690 --> 30:59.680
(LAUGHS)

31:02.277 --> 31:03.267
How's the curry shrimp?

31:04.905 --> 31:07.067
- I have good news.
- The shrimp's amazing?

31:07.282 --> 31:08.363
Oh!

31:14.289 --> 31:15.996
Major is going to get
his memory back.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.835
And the good news
doesn't stop there.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.838
This is me.

31:25.050 --> 31:28.339
This version of me,
small business owner,

31:28.553 --> 31:29.794
amateur lounge singer,

31:30.013 --> 31:33.131
guy that feels lucky every
time you walk through that door.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.592
Major's memory is going
to come back?

31:35.811 --> 31:38.599
It fades out slowly, at first,
and then completely

31:38.814 --> 31:40.726
and then a couple
of days later it just...

31:42.526 --> 31:44.188
Snaps back into place.

31:44.778 --> 31:47.395
- And you know this because...
- Because it's...

31:49.116 --> 31:50.277
It's what happened to me.

31:52.369 --> 31:53.826
And what gave me the idea...

31:55.497 --> 31:56.783
That I could change my life.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.079
Change who I was.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.662
Change how people viewed me.

32:07.843 --> 32:08.799
Well it worked.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.042
(SCOFFS)

32:11.972 --> 32:13.133
You've made a fool of me.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.845
This whole time, my friends
could've been cured.

32:20.564 --> 32:22.305
Liv could've been
human for months.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.820
You're a sad, selfish,
greedy man.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.198
Wait.

32:33.910 --> 32:36.243
What happened to, "It didn't
matter how we got here"?

32:36.621 --> 32:37.907
I'm a lawyer, Blaine.

32:38.707 --> 32:39.697
I shouldn't be trusted.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.461
(DOOR SLAMS)

33:11.656 --> 33:12.567
Hello?

33:16.536 --> 33:17.492
Major!

33:19.748 --> 33:20.704
Mom!

33:26.796 --> 33:28.378
(CRYING)

33:33.053 --> 33:35.136
I should've talked
to you about it.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.217
But I was in high school,

33:38.016 --> 33:39.382
I was confused,

33:39.643 --> 33:40.724
and Dad was a wreck.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.598
I felt like I had
to pick a side,

33:42.812 --> 33:46.396
and it was so much easier to choose the
parent who didn't have a new girlfriend.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.728
So, now you have
to tell me everything.

33:48.944 --> 33:51.311
(LAUGHING) I mean,
the last I heard,

33:51.530 --> 33:53.943
you were engaged to some woman,
and she just broke it off.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.022
Liv.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.112
She, uh...
She did do that.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.034
Hmm. I'm so sorry.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.366
What about now?

34:01.581 --> 34:03.163
Is there someone
new in your life?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.116
Actually, I'm thinking there
might still be a chance

34:05.293 --> 34:06.875
for Liv and I to have
a future together.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.083
The timing might
finally be right.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.333
I'm pretty sure he left
an old address book

34:14.553 --> 34:16.545
in this box of stuff in my
closet. We can start calling...

34:16.763 --> 34:17.628
PEYTON: There you are.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.839
I've been trying to call you,
your voicemail is full.

34:20.058 --> 34:20.922
Major's gone.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.722
We've been up all night, checking
every ER and police station.

34:23.937 --> 34:25.849
- I'm sure we'll hear something soon.
- Really?

34:26.063 --> 34:28.226
What if he's lost his ID and
he can't remember who he is.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.931
And he could be
wandering around forever.

34:30.150 --> 34:32.563
Guys, he should be getting
his memory back soon.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.318
- What?
- The zombie cure works.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.815
No side effects beyond
a couple days of memory loss.

34:39.034 --> 34:41.402
I heard it straight from
the horse's ass's mouth.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.737
- Wait, you're saying...
- Yeah.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.699
Turns out Blaine
was lying this whole time.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.204
He never lost his memory?

34:48.420 --> 34:49.661
Just for a day or two.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.335
Then, I guess it came back
and he was fine,

34:51.547 --> 34:52.880
he just kept
the charade going.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.376
I'm so sorry, Ravi.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.302
Don't. It's fine.

34:58.555 --> 34:59.341
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

34:59.556 --> 35:01.718
I... Is that him?

35:01.975 --> 35:04.638
No, it's... I don't even know
what this number is.

35:05.645 --> 35:06.681
Hello?

35:07.480 --> 35:08.721
Major!

35:08.940 --> 35:10.806
No, I lost my phone,
this is my mom's.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.735
I told you, I'm fine!

35:14.946 --> 35:15.982
Better than fine.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.488
Liv, it works.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.116
The cure works,
my memory is back.

35:22.495 --> 35:23.110
Yeah.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.322
(LAUGHS) Good.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.702
Yeah, just...
It's a long story,

35:27.917 --> 35:29.453
I'll tell you when
you get back.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.286
You are coming back, right?

35:32.088 --> 35:34.205
I can't wait. Bye.

35:35.717 --> 35:36.582
He's fine!

35:37.010 --> 35:40.128
He's in Walla Walla. His mom is
driving him back this afternoon.

35:40.347 --> 35:43.715
Memory's back. He's
human, and normal and fine.

35:43.933 --> 35:46.801
It works, Ravi.
The cure works.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.761
And there's a batch
waiting at the morgue.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.055
So what do you say, Liv?

35:51.650 --> 35:52.766
Ready to be human again?

36:05.413 --> 36:07.370
First thing I do
when I'm human?

36:07.582 --> 36:08.743
Geez, I don't even know.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.244
Don't say ice cream,

36:10.460 --> 36:13.203
I had to watch Major slobber up
gallons of it and it ruined ice cream.

36:13.421 --> 36:14.832
I can't believe
this is happening.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.372
I wanted this for so long.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.924
I can barely even remember
what being human is like.

36:19.844 --> 36:20.800
RAVI: Liv.

36:26.601 --> 36:27.637
We have a problem.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.020
The syringes...

36:32.232 --> 36:33.518
They were locked
in that drawer.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.190
Were...

36:36.986 --> 36:37.942
They're gone.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.324
I told you,
she was at my place.

36:45.078 --> 36:47.195
I know, Tim.
But details matter here.

36:47.414 --> 36:50.373
'Cause if you're not telling the
full truth about who was where, when,

36:50.583 --> 36:52.700
that makes you
an accessory to murder.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.330
You don't strike me
as a prison guy.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.121
Let's run that
timeline once more.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.925
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

37:15.400 --> 37:16.231
Hi, Barb.

37:16.860 --> 37:17.725
We need to talk.

37:19.529 --> 37:22.363
So according to your
boyfriend, Barb,

37:22.574 --> 37:24.486
you left his place earlier
than you told me.

37:24.701 --> 37:25.987
Around 2:00 a.m.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.695
Meaning you don't have an alibi
for the time of the murder.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.575
Well, when I left
Tim's house...

37:30.790 --> 37:32.782
But that's not what
we need to talk about.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.617
What we need
to talk about is this.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.251
This baseball.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.049
We found it in the trash.

37:42.510 --> 37:46.220
Now, why would anyone throw away
a signed Thurman Munson ball?

37:46.431 --> 37:49.014
A similar ball that just sold
on Ebay for 10 grand.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.847
'Cause it's fake,
of course.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.929
Not even a good counterfeit
of the signature.

37:55.565 --> 37:58.353
But you know that, don't you?
That's why you killed Yvonne.

37:59.652 --> 38:02.941
Yvonne owes you back rent
to the tune of $1,000,

38:03.198 --> 38:04.985
so she pawns your baseball.

38:05.200 --> 38:08.534
She replaces it with this one,
hoping you wouldn't notice.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.077
But you did notice.

38:10.538 --> 38:11.574
And you lost your mind.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.535
You confronted her
in the bath.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.583
You throw the dryer
into the tub.

38:18.755 --> 38:19.620
So...

38:20.757 --> 38:22.919
- I am not...
- Be sure to include whether or not

38:23.092 --> 38:25.129
the dryer was already plugged
in when you got there.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.301
Why?

38:26.513 --> 38:28.505
If it was plugged in already,
it's manslaughter.

38:28.765 --> 38:30.222
If you plugged it in,
it's murder.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.514
Your confession may sway me
as to what we charge you with.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.850
It had to be Blaine.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.186
The timing is just
too obvious.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.863
He had knowledge,
opportunity, motive.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.782
He's protecting
his brain business.

38:49.077 --> 38:51.034
Or. Don E.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.158
He knew I had the cure.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.578
He was looking to sell it for big
money to some high roller at the club.

38:57.377 --> 38:59.243
LIV: I was gonna go
for ice cream.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.212
The obvious choice, I know.
But God,

39:02.423 --> 39:03.709
I could taste it already.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.882
Liv... It's okay.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.885
I was so worked up by the
break in, I totally forgot.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.466
There's still a dose left!

39:13.977 --> 39:15.013
Where?

39:16.312 --> 39:17.393
What are we waiting for?

39:17.605 --> 39:20.723
A few weeks ago, I gave a
syringe to Major, just in case.

39:20.942 --> 39:22.183
He never used it.

39:22.402 --> 39:23.734
He's still got one dose.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.815
So, we just wait
for Major to get back?

39:26.030 --> 39:28.568
It'll give you time to think of
something better than ice cream.

39:28.783 --> 39:29.694
A figgy pudding, perhaps.

39:29.951 --> 39:31.613
Oh! Or a sherry trifle.

39:32.203 --> 39:32.943
A good flummery.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.073
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

39:36.916 --> 39:38.157
You look awfully pleased.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.329
Signed confession.

39:40.545 --> 39:41.581
The roommate.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.662
Your pawnshop vision
was the key.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.248
Well, savor this one, Clive.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.378
- It was our last case.
- Why's that?

39:48.303 --> 39:49.714
Ravi's cure works.

39:50.430 --> 39:51.796
Major's back to normal.

39:52.015 --> 39:54.223
No memory loss.
I'm about to take it.

39:54.434 --> 39:57.177
You're throwing in the towel
on being a zombie now?

39:57.604 --> 39:58.970
You can't tough it out
for a few more years?

39:59.188 --> 40:01.100
At least until I get
my Captain bars?

40:07.947 --> 40:10.655
Thanks for giving these past
couple of years meaning, Clive.

40:11.034 --> 40:12.150
You did that yourself.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.451
- (LAUGHS)
- I just took advantage of it.

41:09.217 --> 41:10.583
- Major!
- You're home!

41:10.760 --> 41:12.672
We'd seriously thought
we lost you this time.

41:19.936 --> 41:21.222
It's good to be home.

41:22.105 --> 41:25.894
I'll tell you guys everything, just let me
jump in the shower and then we can celebrate.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.099
Actually, this can't wait.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.605
Someone stole all the remaining
doses of the cure from my office.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.312
- Someone stole...
- Well, let's not dwell on that.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.193
I gave you a syringe
a few weeks back.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.862
It's the last one, and we need it
for Liv. Do you have it with you?

41:37.036 --> 41:38.823
I... I did. Um...

41:42.041 --> 41:43.953
But I didn't tell you.

41:49.298 --> 41:50.084
I...

41:51.217 --> 41:52.378
I gave it to someone.

41:54.429 --> 41:55.510
To whom?
