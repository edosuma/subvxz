00:20.936 --> 00:22.803
You take the skin
particles that others

00:22.805 --> 00:26.873
are done with, you know from
morgues, hospitals, spas.

00:26.875 --> 00:28.442
We repurpose them.

00:28.444 --> 00:29.809
Boil them down,
mix them together

00:29.811 --> 00:31.945
and make useful things
out of them.

00:31.947 --> 00:36.349
Like eyeglass cases,
fancy purses, beautiful

00:36.351 --> 00:39.785
lingerie, you name it,
we can make it.

00:39.787 --> 00:43.991
Yes, I've done some research on
the company. Very impressive.

00:43.993 --> 00:47.327
We're on a mission, Bonnie. It's a
mission that's worth the stink in here.

00:47.329 --> 00:48.729
What's that smell like to you?

00:48.731 --> 00:51.601
Rotting corpse
of a water buffalo maybe?

00:52.500 --> 00:54.800
You know what
it smells like to me?

00:54.802 --> 00:56.238
Smells like money.

00:57.573 --> 01:00.806
That noise?
It's from the basement.

01:00.808 --> 01:04.977
The skin boilers are down there,
in hell, as we like to call it.

01:04.979 --> 01:07.346
And it is hot down there.

01:07.348 --> 01:09.316
Things don't work out for
you up here, we'll send you

01:09.318 --> 01:12.222
to hell to be a boiler.

01:13.722 --> 01:15.721
That was a joke, Bonnie.

01:15.723 --> 01:17.390
You're gonna have to
grow a sense of humor

01:17.392 --> 01:18.961
if you're gonna
survive around here.

01:19.994 --> 01:22.429
Can't really promise you're
gonna survive though, Bonnie.

- Can you guess what my suit's made out of?
- Skin?

01:35.811 --> 01:40.313
Very good, smarty pants. A couple of old
folks moved down to the glorious afterlife

01:40.315 --> 01:43.083
and voilÃ , haute couture.

01:43.085 --> 01:46.053
Anyway, we're on a new program
that's working like a charm.

01:46.055 --> 01:50.860
We're telling the folks around
here, don't be a zombie.

01:53.461 --> 01:54.796
Don't be a zombie.

01:57.032 --> 01:58.864
I came up with that.

01:58.866 --> 01:59.969
It's really funny.

02:01.437 --> 02:05.405
Hi. Sorry to bother you,
Mr. Lee, I had a

02:05.407 --> 02:07.340
little accident on the
way in this morning.

02:07.342 --> 02:09.407
So the [indistinct] report
isn't going to be ready today.

02:09.410 --> 02:12.812
Little accident is what happened
the day you were born, Ted.

02:12.814 --> 02:15.549
I want that report on my desk
first thing Monday morning.

02:15.551 --> 02:16.552
You got it.

02:19.420 --> 02:20.489
I'm sorry.

02:25.461 --> 02:26.626
Is he...?

02:26.628 --> 02:27.830
A zombie?

02:38.140 --> 02:39.409
A zombie.

02:41.777 --> 02:43.046
Never gets old.

02:49.418 --> 02:50.549
Hey, you ready, man?

02:50.551 --> 02:52.754
Yes.

02:58.159 --> 03:00.894
Stephanie wants me to take her
somewhere exotic on vacation.

03:00.896 --> 03:05.132
- Obviously, I'm not taking her to the Caribbean.
- What? Why?

03:05.134 --> 03:07.768
Doesn't seem that'd
be good for you.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.505
What, you mean
the skin thing?

03:11.439 --> 03:14.076
Ricky, for all we know I could
have gotten this on the plane.

03:15.110 --> 03:19.179
And besides, the skin issues
tend to run in my family.

03:19.181 --> 03:20.646
Yes, but you're adopted.

03:20.648 --> 03:23.516
Still... I'm totally fine.

03:26.889 --> 03:28.925
Hi, Ricky, Ted.

03:31.026 --> 03:34.693
I'm eating alone because
Dave's not coming back.

03:34.695 --> 03:35.731
Dave from accounting?

03:37.131 --> 03:39.598
That guy's good.
Where'd he go?

03:39.600 --> 03:42.936
I don't... Who knows?
Seriously.

03:42.938 --> 03:45.475
I guess he won't be winning
best worker anymore.

03:51.612 --> 03:56.419
I hope he isn't eaten
by the zombies, Ted.

04:00.122 --> 04:01.591
What's that supposed to mean?

04:04.926 --> 04:05.827
Nothing.

04:14.702 --> 04:16.873
So, my mom thinks this is
really it for my Poppy.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.175
Sorry to hear that,
buddy.

04:21.510 --> 04:23.146
I know how close you are
to him.

04:24.546 --> 04:27.580
But it seems like he's been
dying ever since I've known you.

04:27.582 --> 04:28.914
Yes, well he's bloody sick.

04:28.916 --> 04:31.150
Have you always said that?

04:31.152 --> 04:34.186
- Say what?
- The word bloody.

04:34.188 --> 04:36.124
I've never heard you say that.

04:39.561 --> 04:43.065
Yeah...
Yeah, I say that sometimes.

05:19.568 --> 05:22.736
I'm sorry, I didn't
know anyone was in here.

05:22.738 --> 05:25.007
I was just trying to get
out of the sunlight.

05:28.577 --> 05:29.479
Wait!

05:42.724 --> 05:45.995
Disorders of a paranormal,
what does it even mean?

05:47.662 --> 05:48.630
Hell if I know.

06:33.008 --> 06:34.544
Fucking zombies.

06:45.287 --> 06:46.589
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

06:52.628 --> 06:54.227
Good morning, everyone.

06:54.229 --> 06:56.395
I am Dr. Lovido.

06:56.397 --> 06:58.099
Welcome to group therapy

07:00.301 --> 07:03.003
with
my good friend and mentor.

07:03.005 --> 07:07.006
Dr. Sigmund Freud likes to say,
"Sex health"!

07:07.008 --> 07:10.410
But enough about me. I didn't
go to school for years and years

07:10.412 --> 07:14.981
to talk about me, let's talk
about you and why you're here.

07:14.983 --> 07:17.784
Wolfgang, why don't you
tell us about you?

07:17.786 --> 07:19.722
Everyone,
help yourself to goodies.

07:23.291 --> 07:25.991
Well, I'm a
motherfucking werewolf.

07:25.993 --> 07:28.094
I got something called
alopecia, which means

07:28.096 --> 07:30.099
I lost all my hair
except for my eyebrows.

07:32.868 --> 07:33.769
Oh, Shit.

07:35.803 --> 07:39.039
I fell in love with this girl named
Katherina. She was fine, you know?

07:39.041 --> 07:43.842
She was a beautiful shoe. We
spent our days as man and woman,

07:43.844 --> 07:45.214
and our nights in the wild.

07:46.313 --> 07:48.150
Then, one night, the<font color="#FF0000">
didn't come,</font>

07:49.051 --> 07:50.719
I looked over and
Katherina was gone.

07:56.691 --> 08:00.059
It's okay.

08:00.061 --> 08:02.097
It's OK. Ok.

08:03.864 --> 08:05.398
Who wants to be next?

08:05.400 --> 08:07.734
Grendel here.
It's my name.

08:07.736 --> 08:09.802
Would you mind if I sit
near the door?

08:09.804 --> 08:11.737
Of course.

08:11.739 --> 08:14.273
Stay out of the way.
Thank you.

08:14.275 --> 08:18.378
Do we have an adorable
claustrophobe in our midst?

08:18.380 --> 08:22.015
Well, it's not so adorable when
you're a cave-dwelling troll.

08:22.017 --> 08:26.352
In this world of slow and<font color="#FF0000">
temerity creatures, ours is</font>

08:26.354 --> 08:29.959
the slowest and dumbest of
them all. Life was great.

08:31.258 --> 08:33.759
But then, I developed this
condition, I started to fear the

08:33.760 --> 08:36.462
caves, eventually, I couldn't
even go in them at all.

08:36.465 --> 08:39.099
I became obsessed and
started just exploring the

08:39.101 --> 08:42.404
world, and that caused
my brain to develop.

08:43.371 --> 08:45.037
So the only way I can go home
to my family

08:45.039 --> 08:45.741
is if you fix me, ma'am.

08:47.342 --> 08:49.175
It's going
to be okay, Grendel.

08:49.177 --> 08:51.845
First things first.
If you've been reading,

08:51.847 --> 08:54.781
I recommend you to
stop that right away.

08:54.783 --> 08:56.449
Oh...
Fuck.

08:56.451 --> 08:59.485
I was afraid you're gonna
say that, and I'm almost done.

08:59.487 --> 09:01.056
Can I just do that last...

09:02.857 --> 09:05.126
Literally like the last
chapter?

09:08.797 --> 09:10.497
- I'm almost...
- No.

09:10.499 --> 09:12.201
Just the
last fucking chapter.

09:15.871 --> 09:17.139
That was great.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.475
Feels like it's not.

09:24.846 --> 09:30.950
- Okay, Elvie, why don't you tell us about you.
- I'm a fairy.

09:30.952 --> 09:33.552
Well, I used to be
a fairy, I don't even

09:33.554 --> 09:37.125
know what to call
myself now, I'm so big.

09:38.326 --> 09:40.496
I lost my wings to
a curious toddler.

09:42.130 --> 09:46.365
Elvie, you must believe you will
always be a fairy at heart.

09:46.367 --> 09:50.238
- You have lessons you can take...
- Hello, sister dear.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.307
What are
you doing here, Nora?

09:55.309 --> 09:57.345
I'm the real Dr. Lovido.

09:59.047 --> 10:00.547
I'm the psychiatrist.

10:00.549 --> 10:01.980
Leave it.
Leave it.

10:01.982 --> 10:03.883
I'm right
down the hall if any

10:03.885 --> 10:06.252
of you want to come
see a real doctor.

10:06.254 --> 10:08.988
Unlike my sister here,
she likes to

10:08.990 --> 10:09.991
call herself doctor.

10:11.125 --> 10:12.492
Don't you, Candy?

10:16.430 --> 10:21.301
Adorable. Your patients
are so sweet, Candy.

10:21.303 --> 10:24.170
It's too bad you sweet
people can't have

10:24.172 --> 10:26.572
any of these medications
which I have

10:26.574 --> 10:30.343
because your doctor
isn't a real doctor.

10:30.345 --> 10:33.079
You know
I've always hated you.

10:33.081 --> 10:34.517
You were always
mother's favorite.

10:39.888 --> 10:43.623
Well, I'll be heading back
to my office now.

10:43.625 --> 10:48.164
The nice one down the hall
with the donuts.

10:49.029 --> 10:51.029
Oh!

10:51.031 --> 10:52.967
Wrong room, Mr. Matthews.

10:54.068 --> 10:56.134
You know where to find me.

10:58.640 --> 10:59.875
She seems really nice.

11:18.894 --> 11:20.162
I'm gonna need another<font color="#FF0000">.</font>

12:03.672 --> 12:05.003
Ow, ow!
Dad. What?

12:05.005 --> 12:06.471
What's going on?

12:06.473 --> 12:09.676
Things are not good, Ted.
Linda's still here

12:09.678 --> 12:11.511
and it doesn't
seem like she's going anywhere.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.412
We need you to say something.

12:13.414 --> 12:15.447
Me?
Why me?

12:15.449 --> 12:18.051
You're full and strong, Ted.

12:18.053 --> 12:19.252
Talk to him, Jorge.

12:19.254 --> 12:21.119
I'm gonna get the juice.

12:21.121 --> 12:23.156
I paid my dues, okay?

12:23.158 --> 12:25.624
Your mother and I are taking
the brunt of this here.

12:25.626 --> 12:28.226
What kind of father is okay with
his son possibly losing an arm?

12:28.228 --> 12:30.595
What kind of a son is okay with
their father losing two arms?

12:30.597 --> 12:35.969
Sshh, Dad. I know she's not
a very powerful sorceress yet.

12:35.971 --> 12:40.340
- That's easy for you to say.
- I'm sorry, okay?

12:40.342 --> 12:43.408
I'm sorry, but I think she's
gonna get bored and move on

12:43.410 --> 12:45.744
and Poppy's always said that he
doesn't want to get married again.

12:45.746 --> 12:48.147
In the meantime, I'm
target practice here.

12:48.149 --> 12:49.349
Okay.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.984
She has got to go.

12:50.986 --> 12:52.187
Okay.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.623
Yeah.

12:58.625 --> 12:59.993
Hi, Linda.

12:59.995 --> 13:01.226
Hi, Poppy.

13:01.228 --> 13:03.329
Look who finally
come to visit.

13:03.331 --> 13:04.998
I'm dying here, asshole.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.766
Poppy, don't want
to work during the week.

13:06.768 --> 13:08.734
I bet you're hoping you don't
have to do that anymore

13:08.736 --> 13:12.604
after I die. Last night, I was
counting the money,

13:12.606 --> 13:15.074
I figured I'm worth
about 24 million now.

13:15.076 --> 13:17.576
If I keep getting lucky
on the stock market.

13:17.578 --> 13:21.781
Now, who should I give all
that money to after I die?

13:21.783 --> 13:25.551
Sweetie, you will
need at least 20 million

13:25.553 --> 13:28.454
human-earned dollars to become
a legitimate sorceress.

13:28.456 --> 13:32.124
Remember the old saying,
sorceresses without extreme

13:32.126 --> 13:37.532
human-earned wealth are but
sheep with beautiful faces.

13:38.632 --> 13:41.633
- Uh... Poppy...
- Shut up, kid.

13:41.635 --> 13:43.235
Don't ruin this moment.

13:43.237 --> 13:45.104
Get your daddy a drink,
sweetheart.

13:45.106 --> 13:46.272
All right, mom.

13:46.274 --> 13:48.173
Here, Teddy, have some juice.

13:48.175 --> 13:51.277
We had a
family meeting

13:51.279 --> 13:56.986
and we all agree that it's time
for you to settle down.

13:57.718 --> 13:59.420
What I'm trying to
say, Teddy is,

14:01.456 --> 14:05.391
a wife doesn't want her husband
to be a zombie.

14:05.393 --> 14:08.161
Nobody wants
to marry a weirdo.

14:08.163 --> 14:09.731
I'm not a weirdo
and I'm not a zombie.

14:11.399 --> 14:12.798
You guys
even know what a zombie is?

14:12.800 --> 14:14.332
You don't really know a zombie

14:14.334 --> 14:16.335
until you had sex with one.

14:16.337 --> 14:17.505
I know what a zombie is.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.407
I've read about it
on a computer.

14:24.678 --> 14:28.781
It's disgusting is what it is.
You're a generation in denial, son.

14:28.783 --> 14:32.384
Nobody gets married anymore. You're
just hopping from bed to bed, huh?

14:32.386 --> 14:36.592
Jorge! Now, Teddy didn't get
that from having sex.

14:37.792 --> 14:38.493
Did you, Ted?

14:39.760 --> 14:42.561
Say hello to
your next president

14:42.563 --> 14:44.699
and first lady, I mean ladies.

14:47.735 --> 14:48.770
Come on, girl.

14:49.904 --> 14:53.473
Do you know how expensive
running for office is, Poppy?

14:53.475 --> 14:55.508
Only the wealthiest
people can do it.

14:55.510 --> 14:57.243
Oh, yeah?

14:57.245 --> 14:58.878
That should put our
family on the map, huh?

14:58.880 --> 15:00.680
You know Pop, by the way,
just in case you all

15:00.682 --> 15:03.615
forgot, I am running
on a platform of

15:03.617 --> 15:07.119
blow everybody up that does
not think America is the

15:07.121 --> 15:08.387
greatest country ever.

15:08.389 --> 15:11.724
I call it America or boom.

15:11.726 --> 15:14.462
America or boom, baby.

15:15.730 --> 15:17.562
- Boom! Boom!
- Boom!

15:17.564 --> 15:19.565
Now, that's some bullshit
right there,

15:19.567 --> 15:22.301
because ain't nobody
gonna vote for no black man

15:22.303 --> 15:23.672
threatening
to blow up the world.

15:25.273 --> 15:26.439
Jean, Jean, Jean.

15:26.441 --> 15:28.441
Jenny the Jean.

15:28.443 --> 15:30.209
You don't get it, do you?

15:30.211 --> 15:32.577
We are going to save the world.

15:32.579 --> 15:34.379
While me and your sister
is doing that, you're just

15:34.381 --> 15:36.382
gonna sit over there with
your one-armed husband.

15:36.384 --> 15:39.719
No disrespect, man. All my
greatest heroes are one-armed,

15:39.721 --> 15:42.622
but just sitting there and nagging
that we ain't doing it right.

15:42.624 --> 15:43.822
She ain't doing it right.

15:43.824 --> 15:45.827
America or boom, baby.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.728
Now, who's getting
naked with me?

15:48.730 --> 15:49.630
Come on.

15:51.665 --> 15:53.566
That's gonna be my
mission as first lady.

15:53.568 --> 15:54.533
What's that, baby?

15:54.535 --> 15:56.902
Nudity is freedom.

15:56.904 --> 15:59.172
Freedom is nudity.

15:59.174 --> 16:00.808
Shi...
Come here, girl!

16:04.411 --> 16:06.845
Get the motherfuckers
off my table.

16:06.847 --> 16:07.815
That's enough.

16:09.483 --> 16:11.783
- Sit down, you two.
- Okay.

16:11.785 --> 16:13.652
Forgive me, everybody.
I'm sorry.

16:13.654 --> 16:15.854
Forgive me for just trying to
make love to my wife

16:15.856 --> 16:17.623
at the dinner table.

16:17.625 --> 16:19.128
I thought we was all family.

16:20.596 --> 16:23.595
Have I ever told you all about the
first time I ever got naked in public?

16:23.597 --> 16:27.733
- Yes.
- Life changer.

16:27.735 --> 16:29.634
I was there that day, remember?

16:29.636 --> 16:32.305
I saw how your life changed.

16:32.307 --> 16:34.574
Look at that boy's skin.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.509
- I think it's getting worse.
- Excuse me?

16:37.511 --> 16:40.412
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you could hear me.

16:40.414 --> 16:42.281
I'm sitting right
across the table from you.

16:42.283 --> 16:46.219
Bradley, you know skin
problems run in this family.

16:46.221 --> 16:48.490
- I mean, we all have them.
- That's the truth.

16:49.490 --> 16:51.856
Poppy and I are
talking about getting married.

16:51.858 --> 16:53.325
Wha, wha, what?

16:53.327 --> 16:55.327
- What?
- There's no hurry.

16:55.329 --> 16:58.297
I mean, we're gonna be in
love forever anyways.

16:58.299 --> 17:01.367
Yeah, I mean, there's no sense
in rushing anything, Pop.

17:01.369 --> 17:04.435
- I mean, you and I like being bachelors, right?
- My man.

17:04.438 --> 17:05.404
Chili boom.

17:05.406 --> 17:06.973
Chili boom.

17:10.244 --> 17:12.978
What the hell, son? Your
furniture is a piece of crap.

17:12.980 --> 17:14.945
It's not
the furniture, it's...

17:14.948 --> 17:16.983
It's not the furniture,
Poppy. It's...

17:16.984 --> 17:19.917
Wo, wo, wo.
Remember, chili boom, chili bam.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.421
Look, Teddy. Teddy, take this
from your uncle, okay?

17:23.423 --> 17:27.592
You got to always watch
out for red flags.

17:27.594 --> 17:29.361
No, not you baby.
You're not a red flag.

17:29.363 --> 17:31.563
You are a red,
white, and blue flag

17:31.565 --> 17:33.965
flying over the east wing
of my heart.

17:33.967 --> 17:37.336
I'm talking about real red flags.
The ones that will just pop out

17:37.338 --> 17:40.339
- of a nice pretty package like boom.
- Boom!

17:40.341 --> 17:42.942
Just pop out when you least
expect it like, boom, boom.

17:42.944 --> 17:45.910
Red flag, red flag, red flag.

17:45.912 --> 17:47.346
Seven of them in a row.

17:47.348 --> 17:48.981
Boom!

17:48.983 --> 17:53.918
- Teddy, my boy. Some more coupons.
- Thanks, Pop.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.488
I know you've been having a
hard time so I want to help out.

17:56.490 --> 17:58.523
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Poppy.

17:58.525 --> 18:00.493
The only thing is,
if I find out you're

18:00.495 --> 18:03.361
a zombie, that's it, no
more coupons, Teddy.

18:03.363 --> 18:04.696
- Poppy, I'm not a zombie.
- All right.

18:04.698 --> 18:05.866
I'm not a zombie.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.402
Poppy, I'm not a zombie.

18:12.372 --> 18:14.340
Zombies are funny.

18:16.944 --> 18:18.914
Carrie, you ain't
nothing but a damn fool.

18:20.014 --> 18:23.416
You know what they say,
zombies are quite comical.

18:25.553 --> 18:27.852
What the hell we got to
do to get some food around here?

18:27.854 --> 18:29.655
Jorge, be a good boy
and bring mama

18:29.657 --> 18:31.791
and Linda another martini
while you're in there.

18:31.793 --> 18:33.958
I got your momma.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.727
Did you see that?

18:35.729 --> 18:40.465
I wish she would. Trust me.
I wish she would.

18:40.467 --> 18:45.103
Don't be silly, Bradley. Jorge is
doing the best he can with one arm.

18:45.105 --> 18:47.540
And I'm pretty sure he
doesn't want to know

18:47.542 --> 18:49.343
what life would be
like with no arms.

18:53.046 --> 18:56.550
This woman's voice
is music to my ears.

18:58.352 --> 18:59.454
It must be deaf ears.

19:39.127 --> 19:40.829
- Ricky.
- Hi, honey.

19:42.397 --> 19:44.463
Oh, God, why is it
always so smoky in here?

19:44.465 --> 19:46.866
It's just the
machines downstairs.

19:46.868 --> 19:49.467
Oh, yeah?
It's not good for my hair.

19:49.469 --> 19:51.436
God, is there no other
cubicle you can

19:51.438 --> 19:54.106
sit in that's not
next to a zombie?

19:54.108 --> 19:55.010
Excuse me?

19:56.643 --> 19:57.778
Ted is not a zombie.

19:59.447 --> 20:01.513
Look at his forehead.

20:01.515 --> 20:03.581
I am not a zombie.

20:05.719 --> 20:06.685
Ted.

20:06.687 --> 20:09.487
Oh, God.

20:09.489 --> 20:10.424
Ted?

20:11.825 --> 20:15.727
Stephanie, Ted is not
a zombie and you know it.

20:15.729 --> 20:20.032
All right, he's got
a disease or something.

20:20.034 --> 20:21.766
Thanks, man.
I'm sitting right here.

20:21.768 --> 20:24.536
- Skin thing, whatever.
- Right. You know what?

20:24.538 --> 20:26.205
It doesn't matter because
I came down here

20:26.207 --> 20:28.506
to tell you
that we're done, okay?

20:28.508 --> 20:30.077
It is over, Ricky.

20:30.977 --> 20:33.446
You never even taken
me on a vacation.

20:33.448 --> 20:34.949
- Trust me, vacations are not...
- Shh!

20:36.684 --> 20:38.484
You don't
deserve me, Ricky.

20:38.486 --> 20:41.887
I am diamonds and you
are a fucking rock.

20:41.889 --> 20:43.688
Yeah.
You're my diamond.

20:43.690 --> 20:45.726
- Not anymore.
- Stephanie!

20:47.928 --> 20:49.829
So, Joe is gone.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.697
Yes. Mel, I'm
a little busy right now.

20:52.699 --> 20:54.769
Will you vote for me
for best worker?

20:56.070 --> 20:59.071
- Yeah, I'll vote for you.
- Because you're not gonna get it, right?

20:59.073 --> 21:00.773
I'll vote for you.

21:00.775 --> 21:02.576
- Oh, seriously?
- Right. Okay.

21:04.579 --> 21:09.013
People are saying Ted ate Joe.

21:09.015 --> 21:10.819
Did not eat Joe, Mel.

21:12.620 --> 21:15.521
Ricky, look, if you
need a place to stay,

21:15.523 --> 21:17.692
you know you can always
crash in my place... again.

21:19.927 --> 21:20.928
Thanks.

21:41.681 --> 21:43.184
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

21:44.951 --> 21:46.621
Oh, my God.
What's happening to me?

21:50.190 --> 21:52.090
Oh, God, oh God.

21:55.763 --> 22:00.198
- It's you. What's up?
- Hey, dude. I got us some beer and chips.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.069
The essentials, perfect.
Thank you.

22:21.121 --> 22:24.657
- Thanks.
- Hey, thanks for letting me stay here, dude.

22:24.659 --> 22:27.560
Yes, you can stay here as long as
you need to. You know that, right?

22:27.562 --> 22:28.994
Yes, except I'm
not sleeping too well

22:28.996 --> 22:31.163
so I probably should
find my own place.

22:31.165 --> 22:33.902
Yes, well, you can't sleep on
your buddy's chair forever.

22:39.707 --> 22:41.842
So, did you
go see the doctor?

22:43.009 --> 22:43.777
For what?

22:45.313 --> 22:47.716
- For the skin thing?
- Yeah. And...

22:50.251 --> 22:51.617
And what?

22:51.619 --> 22:52.888
Ted, are you...

22:54.655 --> 22:55.991
I think you should see someone.

22:58.959 --> 22:59.861
Something is wrong.

23:00.995 --> 23:01.994
All right.

23:01.996 --> 23:03.262
What are you doing?

23:03.264 --> 23:04.929
- Ted, what are you doing?
- What?

23:04.931 --> 23:06.231
What are you freaking out about?

23:06.233 --> 23:07.769
You have something in your hair.

23:13.608 --> 23:14.709
What did you think
I was gonna do?

23:18.946 --> 23:20.913
You freak me out, man.

23:38.733 --> 23:39.634
I wouldn't.

23:52.178 --> 23:55.182
- Is that how that song goes?
- No.

23:56.883 --> 23:59.417
I got skin for
days here, Bonnie.

23:59.419 --> 24:00.721
Where is my loofa?

24:07.894 --> 24:10.094
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hey.

24:10.096 --> 24:11.730
These are
for the Texas team.

24:11.732 --> 24:12.830
- Thanks, Bonnie.
- Mhm...

24:15.436 --> 24:16.338
Bonnie?

24:17.303 --> 24:18.206
Yes?

24:20.408 --> 24:22.107
Are you okay?

24:22.109 --> 24:23.078
Yes, I'm fine.

24:24.745 --> 24:28.382
Mr. Lee is a weed, but a weed
is just an unloved flower.

24:29.449 --> 24:34.686
- What?
- It's Ella Wheeler Wilcox.

24:34.688 --> 24:38.724
Anyway, Mr. Lee may be just an unloved
flower, but I took a look at those

24:38.726 --> 24:40.892
before sending the out because
today he is an unloved flower

24:40.894 --> 24:42.226
on a rampage.

24:42.228 --> 24:44.332
That makes today
different from what day?

24:46.367 --> 24:49.301
Looks like you've been doing
some good work there, Bonnie.

24:49.303 --> 24:52.003
Oh, thank you.

24:52.005 --> 24:52.873
Mel.

24:54.941 --> 24:56.777
I'm also gonna
get the best worker.

24:58.012 --> 24:59.343
- Sorry.
- What?

24:59.345 --> 25:00.946
It's a competition
we have going on,

25:00.948 --> 25:02.347
the best worker competition.

25:02.349 --> 25:03.815
You've probably
seen the sign.

25:03.817 --> 25:05.384
Yes, Mr. Lee
told me about it.

25:05.386 --> 25:07.953
What? Did he tell you
you we're gonna win it?

25:07.955 --> 25:08.890
Did he?

25:09.989 --> 25:10.891
No.

25:11.892 --> 25:14.094
Because it would be
ultra not cool if he did.

25:16.162 --> 25:17.730
Can I show you something
in the basement?

25:17.732 --> 25:20.799
Mel, I'm sure
Bonnie is probably busy.

25:20.801 --> 25:25.270
Yes, yes, I am pretty busy,
but maybe another time?

25:25.272 --> 25:26.972
Later today or tomorrow?

25:26.974 --> 25:29.343
Mel, What's got into you?

25:30.477 --> 25:31.379
Sandwich.

25:33.514 --> 25:35.379
Ted want's to eat your
brains, by the way.

25:35.381 --> 25:36.982
What?
No, I don't.

25:36.984 --> 25:38.884
You may have
eaten Dave and Joe.

25:38.886 --> 25:40.452
I did not eat Dave and Joe.

25:40.454 --> 25:42.788
You may have
eaten Joe and Dave.

25:42.790 --> 25:45.224
- I did not eat Joe and Dave.
- He's got a problem.

25:45.226 --> 25:47.024
Why you keep telling
the whole f###ing...

25:47.026 --> 25:48.162
Freeze. Police.

25:52.466 --> 25:55.770
I'm Sgt. Angus and
this is my partner Sgt. Zeus.

25:56.937 --> 25:59.972
- Like the Greek god Zeus?
- Just like the Greek god Zeus, yes.

25:59.974 --> 26:03.175
Exactly. We need to ask you
folks some questions on account

26:03.177 --> 26:05.244
of the two missing persons
who used to work here.

26:05.246 --> 26:06.378
Questions.

26:06.380 --> 26:08.246
Dave and Joe?

26:08.248 --> 26:09.982
Exactly.

26:09.984 --> 26:11.483
They were my friends.

26:11.485 --> 26:14.887
Okay, very good.
Do you know where they are?

26:14.889 --> 26:18.357
- Missing. Ted is a zombie.
- Oh, my God.

26:18.359 --> 26:20.826
- He is...
- Okay, that is enough. I am not a zombie.

26:20.828 --> 26:23.328
- I'm not a zombie.
- It's true, yes.

26:23.330 --> 26:24.996
What's wrong
with your skin, boy?

26:24.998 --> 26:26.865
Excuse me?
Okay, first of all,

26:26.867 --> 26:28.567
that's none of your business,
and second of all

26:28.569 --> 26:30.435
skin issues tend to run
in my family, okay?

26:30.437 --> 26:32.937
- So, that's what it is.
- That's disgusting.

26:32.939 --> 26:36.308
We will be back with further
questions for all of you.

26:36.310 --> 26:40.081
So, I suggest none of you take
any vacations any time soon.

26:48.054 --> 26:49.987
- Wow.
- Get back to work, people.

26:49.989 --> 26:51.857
Frank's gonna
come any minute.

26:51.859 --> 26:53.859
Bonnie, loofa.

26:53.861 --> 26:54.993
God.

27:40.274 --> 27:41.176
Ricky?

27:44.344 --> 27:45.878
Ricky.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.246
No, stay away,
away from me.

27:48.248 --> 27:49.383
Bonnie?

27:50.284 --> 27:51.917
Bonnie, I'm so sorry.

27:51.919 --> 27:54.119
Are you okay?

27:54.121 --> 27:55.987
You don't look like
you've been sleeping.

27:55.989 --> 27:58.090
I'm still
sleeping on Ted's chair

27:58.092 --> 28:00.425
until I could find
a place of my own.

28:00.427 --> 28:01.262
Really?

28:02.963 --> 28:06.164
Well, my roommate and I are
looking for another roommate.

28:06.166 --> 28:08.567
If you put the knife down

28:08.569 --> 28:11.069
we'd love to
have you moving in with us.

28:11.071 --> 28:12.236
Really?

28:12.238 --> 28:13.140
Wow.

28:16.576 --> 28:18.243
Where have you been?

28:18.245 --> 28:20.281
Drop some
stuff off in the basement.

28:29.657 --> 28:33.457
<i>Bonnie,
Where the fuck is my loofa?</i>

28:33.459 --> 28:34.394
See you guys.

29:07.961 --> 29:09.096
Ted, what the fuck?

29:10.464 --> 29:12.164
You need help, man.

29:12.166 --> 29:17.005
- That is not normal.
- What?

29:20.975 --> 29:26.477
- Sorry, Ted. You just don't...
- Wendy's gone.

29:26.479 --> 29:28.146
- So much cringe, where'd she go?
- Who's Wendy?

29:28.148 --> 29:31.616
- Where'd she go?
- Wait, wait, the singing intern?

29:31.618 --> 29:35.387
- She just walked by.
- Yes, she was an ultra good worker too.

29:37.457 --> 29:40.091
Sure hope there isn't a
zombie going around

29:40.093 --> 29:41.629
eating people.

29:47.034 --> 29:49.568
Why? Why are you guys
looking at me? Seriously.

29:49.570 --> 29:51.369
- I'm gonna go back to my...
- I'm not a zombie.

29:51.371 --> 29:55.107
I'm not a zombie.

29:55.109 --> 29:56.577
Stop.

29:58.245 --> 29:59.714
To work with
these kind of people...

30:06.486 --> 30:10.421
I think I'm gonna
I'm gonna write you up.

30:10.423 --> 30:11.325
Mel?

30:15.562 --> 30:16.464
Mel.

30:28.508 --> 30:32.209
Olivia, tell
the group about yourself.

30:32.211 --> 30:37.648
Okay, I've been feeling weird
since I got back from Romania.

30:37.650 --> 30:41.719
Some things have changed,
most noticeably my teeth.

30:45.359 --> 30:48.159
And I'm really strong.

30:48.161 --> 30:49.761
People seem to think
I'm a vampire,

30:49.763 --> 30:51.499
which I clearly am not.

30:52.632 --> 30:54.065
Just because
I have pointed teeth

30:54.067 --> 30:56.134
and I like to eat my meat rare.

30:56.136 --> 31:00.141
Olivia, are you feeling
the urge to bite people?

31:01.108 --> 31:04.278
I've thought about it,
but no more than anyone else.

31:06.412 --> 31:09.347
I would never do anything
that would hurt someone.

31:09.349 --> 31:10.648
You have to believe me.

31:10.650 --> 31:11.552
I believe you.

31:13.286 --> 31:14.188
Thank you.

31:16.189 --> 31:17.091
Ted.

31:18.624 --> 31:20.091
Ted.

31:20.093 --> 31:23.430
Oh, uh, right.

31:24.531 --> 31:27.532
Well, to be completely
honest I'm only here

31:27.534 --> 31:29.467
because...

31:29.469 --> 31:32.337
Well, I saw Olivia carrying
bowling balls into

31:32.339 --> 31:36.144
my work, and I just
wanted to talk to her.

31:37.744 --> 31:41.446
I work at the bowling alley,
moving the balls around.

31:41.448 --> 31:46.851
So, Ted, you're not here because
you want help with anything?

31:46.853 --> 31:50.688
Well, I mean, nobody's perfect.
Like...

31:50.690 --> 31:53.460
This skin thing I picked up in
the Caribbean, for example.

31:54.527 --> 31:55.894
Yes, my family is crazy.

31:55.896 --> 31:57.565
Of course.

31:58.765 --> 32:00.101
I also like my meat rare.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.600
You do?

32:02.602 --> 32:04.802
Well, perhaps
you two should both

32:04.804 --> 32:08.473
consider a multivitamin
with iron in it.

32:08.475 --> 32:09.510
Also try masturbation.

32:10.409 --> 32:11.312
Pickle anyone?

32:21.155 --> 32:22.190
So...

32:24.858 --> 32:27.528
Maybe I could make dinner
for you Saturday night?

32:28.762 --> 32:31.666
Yes, okay.
I'm in.

32:32.599 --> 32:34.899
What? Oh. No.

32:34.901 --> 32:37.138
I'm sorry, Grendel.
I was talking to Olivia.

32:39.339 --> 32:41.876
Yes, I'd like that.

34:11.864 --> 34:13.797
And then, we're
gonna change the oval

34:13.800 --> 34:15.833
office to a triangle,
or a rectangle, or...

34:15.835 --> 34:18.370
- Diamond.
- Diamond! Exactly, diamond. Something like that.

34:18.371 --> 34:19.870
You know, just to keep everybody
on their toes.

34:19.871 --> 34:21.304
- Ain't that right, babe?
- Mmm.

34:21.306 --> 34:22.474
And every Friday
is gonna be

34:22.476 --> 34:24.475
no foreigner Friday, of course.

34:24.476 --> 34:29.545
I can't wait, my
big, strong president.

34:29.547 --> 34:32.983
I love you best in a top hat,
and nothing else.

34:32.985 --> 34:34.385
Oh, and just to be clear
with everybody,

34:34.387 --> 34:36.021
when she said in a top hat,

34:36.023 --> 34:36.956
I'm not
wearing it on my head.

34:40.025 --> 34:44.762
- Teddy, did you lose your hair comb?
- No, ma, this is the new style.

34:44.764 --> 34:47.063
You might at least want to
put some conditioner in there.

34:47.065 --> 34:50.668
Here, try
this Infinite Naturals.

34:50.670 --> 34:54.342
This stuff is great, and it
works well on everything.

34:56.909 --> 34:59.343
Okay, Okay, I...
Okay, I can do it. Stop.

34:59.345 --> 35:00.745
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

35:00.747 --> 35:02.513
Listen to your mother.

35:02.515 --> 35:03.847
Never tested on animals.

35:03.849 --> 35:05.450
Infinite Naturals

35:05.452 --> 35:07.919
...is naturally infinite.

35:07.921 --> 35:08.956
Don't use too much.

35:09.889 --> 35:11.990
Ted, you should get a wife.

35:11.992 --> 35:13.658
The fuck does
he need a wife for?

35:13.660 --> 35:18.662
- Well, I am seeing someone.
- What?

35:18.664 --> 35:21.635
- Yeah.
- Oooh, thank you, God.

35:23.003 --> 35:25.470
- Please don't tell me she's a goblin.
- No.

35:25.472 --> 35:27.604
Stop it, mama.
My son isn't like that.

35:27.606 --> 35:30.675
Not that there would be anything
wrong with it if you were.

35:30.677 --> 35:32.711
When do we get
to meet her, baby?

35:32.713 --> 35:34.845
Well, I was
thinking of inviting her

35:34.847 --> 35:38.350
- to come with me to dinner one night.
- Oh, dinner!

35:38.352 --> 35:41.452
- If I do, you all need to behave.
- Of course.

35:41.454 --> 35:42.986
We're just
regular people, baby.

35:42.988 --> 35:44.923
- She's very sensitive.
- That could be a problem.

35:44.925 --> 35:48.792
Like that. Why are you doing...
Uncle Bradley, you can't be

35:48.794 --> 35:51.095
doing that at the dinner
table when she's here.

35:51.097 --> 35:53.030
That's weird.

35:53.032 --> 35:55.566
I can't be doing this?

35:55.568 --> 35:56.901
- Can I do that?
- No.

35:56.903 --> 36:00.604
- How about...
- No.

36:00.606 --> 36:01.740
All right.

36:01.742 --> 36:03.774
I apologize, everybody.

36:03.776 --> 36:05.977
I did not know the new
rules of this family.

36:05.979 --> 36:09.446
Forgive me for gently
caressing, tweaking

36:09.448 --> 36:11.649
and my wife
at the dinner table.

36:11.651 --> 36:13.684
I don't know who this
damn family is anymore.

36:13.686 --> 36:15.653
What's wrong with her?
She's not a weirdo, is she?

36:15.655 --> 36:16.954
No, there's nothing wrong
with her,

36:16.956 --> 36:18.423
and she's not a bloody
weirdo.

36:18.425 --> 36:19.624
Have you always said that?

36:19.626 --> 36:20.959
- Said what?
- Never mind.

36:20.961 --> 36:22.430
She's beautiful.

36:25.798 --> 36:28.533
She is a vampire.

36:28.535 --> 36:31.702
- A vampire?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

36:31.704 --> 36:34.104
Teddy, are
you doing a vampire?

36:34.106 --> 36:38.108
No, she looks like
a vampire, but she's not...

36:38.110 --> 36:39.379
What?

36:40.113 --> 36:44.816
Dude.

36:44.818 --> 36:47.050
What do you have, what did you
bring for lunch today?

36:47.052 --> 36:50.053
I haven't had time to eat.

36:50.055 --> 36:51.758
I'm such an ultra...

36:52.892 --> 36:54.626
- Mel.
- Mel.

36:54.628 --> 36:56.026
You really need
to stop doing that.

36:56.028 --> 36:58.896
What?
I'm such an ultra hard worker.

36:58.898 --> 37:00.700
Yes, that's nice.

37:02.769 --> 37:05.135
- Can you guys...
- Mel!

37:05.137 --> 37:08.606
Can you guys vote for me for
best worker next week?

37:08.608 --> 37:11.809
Is that next week?
Sure.

37:11.811 --> 37:13.046
Yes, we'll vote for you.

37:13.979 --> 37:17.148
- Mel, can you...
- Hey, guys.

37:17.150 --> 37:20.684
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, Bonnie.

37:20.686 --> 37:22.954
Okay, but I got to go.

37:22.956 --> 37:24.555
Can I show you something
in the basement?

37:24.557 --> 37:26.024
Mel.

37:26.026 --> 37:28.829
Never mind. It's
also uninteresting.

37:30.197 --> 37:31.762
What's up?

37:31.764 --> 37:33.433
I'll show you later.

37:38.171 --> 37:40.939
So, Ted, Ricky tells me

37:40.941 --> 37:43.106
that you've really hit it
off with that chick Olivia.

37:43.108 --> 37:44.943
She's perfect.

37:44.945 --> 37:46.414
I've never met anyone like her.

37:47.713 --> 37:48.882
That's really cool.

37:49.782 --> 37:52.483
So how's things for
the two roommates?

37:54.019 --> 37:55.854
Ricky is amazing.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.555
He made dinner last night.

37:57.557 --> 37:59.691
- Oh, did he?
- Mhm.

37:59.693 --> 38:03.628
Well, she... You have to work late.
She had to work late.

38:03.630 --> 38:05.829
Bonnie is working on a
huge project for Samson.

38:05.831 --> 38:08.832
- Frank Lee's boss?
- Yes.

38:08.834 --> 38:10.167
He found out
about my qualifications

38:10.169 --> 38:11.771
and needed some work done, so...

38:13.539 --> 38:16.874
And you know, she's got an MBA
so she's more qualified

38:16.876 --> 38:18.742
to run this place
than Frank Lee is.

38:18.744 --> 38:19.943
He's got his own
secretary

38:19.945 --> 38:20.979
running circles around him.

38:20.981 --> 38:23.146
That's... wow.

38:23.148 --> 38:25.249
It couldn't happen to
a bigger ass than Frank Lee.

38:25.251 --> 38:27.017
Speaking of which,
I've got some stuff

38:27.019 --> 38:28.887
that I need to finish up
for him before lunch.

38:28.889 --> 38:33.494
- So, see you guys later.
- See you later.

38:38.932 --> 38:41.135
- What?
- Exactly "what".

38:42.302 --> 38:44.769
Dude, I haven't heard you
mention Stephanie in weeks.

38:44.771 --> 38:47.305
Honestly, I'm not even thinking
about Stephanie anymore.

38:47.307 --> 38:49.140
When she calls, it goes
straight to voicema...

38:49.142 --> 38:52.577
Meet me in hell.
Bring the girl.

38:52.579 --> 38:54.912
Mel, just cut
it out, all right?

38:54.914 --> 38:56.914
You're starting to
freak everyone out.

38:56.916 --> 38:59.017
- Me?
- Yes.

38:59.019 --> 39:02.053
Well, at least I'm not
a zombie who eats people.

39:02.055 --> 39:05.923
Ted, are you?

39:06.860 --> 39:07.894
Ted!

39:10.729 --> 39:13.030
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's got into me.

39:13.032 --> 39:15.166
You need to get some help.

39:15.168 --> 39:17.734
I'm just sick and tired
of people calling me a zombie.

39:17.736 --> 39:18.706
You're a zombie, Ted.

39:28.314 --> 39:30.650
What have you done, Ted?

39:53.606 --> 39:55.708
Ted, what's wrong?

39:56.742 --> 39:58.578
That was a bad dream.

40:01.046 --> 40:02.715
You're not dreaming anymore.

40:04.150 --> 40:05.718
Thank God for that.

40:11.724 --> 40:13.059
I dreamt
my whole family was dead.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.258
My God.

40:15.260 --> 40:16.930
That's scary.

40:18.097 --> 40:18.998
Yes, it was.

40:21.700 --> 40:23.834
Speaking of which,

40:23.836 --> 40:26.606
would you want to come over
on Friday and meet them?

40:27.974 --> 40:29.910
Yes, I'd love to.

40:33.246 --> 40:34.814
Tell me about Romania.

40:36.148 --> 40:40.019
Well, it wasn't
at all what I expected.

40:44.157 --> 40:46.923
I met a guy there, a botanist.

40:46.925 --> 40:48.962
He wouldn't go out at all
during the day.

40:51.197 --> 40:52.633
A night botanist, huh?

40:54.300 --> 40:56.733
I would wake up in
the middle of the night and

40:56.735 --> 40:58.838
find him staring at me, with
an odd look on his face.

41:00.106 --> 41:01.008
Dragonmere?

41:08.682 --> 41:10.280
Olivia, have you
ever felt that maybe

41:10.282 --> 41:11.851
Dragonmere was a...

41:13.086 --> 41:16.187
Well, that he was a...

41:16.189 --> 41:17.224
A what?

41:19.925 --> 41:20.827
Never mind.

41:22.327 --> 41:24.364
Tell me about your
trip to the Caribbean.

41:26.131 --> 41:30.367
Well, I went to this touristy
voodoo thing, you know.

41:30.369 --> 41:33.137
While they were doing this good
luck ritual,

41:33.139 --> 41:36.977
things got kind of... weird.

41:39.012 --> 41:44.182
Welcome to voodoo for you
and the celebration of luck.

41:44.184 --> 41:46.983
I will now give you good luck.

41:52.959 --> 41:55.093
What the
fuck did you do now?

41:55.095 --> 41:56.430
Oh, my God.

42:02.135 --> 42:04.805
I haven't been feeling so
good ever since I've been back.

42:30.796 --> 42:31.896
Such a gentleman.

42:31.898 --> 42:33.100
Oh, I try to be.

42:45.845 --> 42:49.780
Olivia, this is my dad, Jorge,
and my mom, Jean.

42:49.782 --> 42:51.983
- Nice to meet you.
- What's wrong with your teeth?

42:51.985 --> 42:53.885
- Mom.
- Your mom is just trying to make

42:53.887 --> 42:55.820
some small talk with
your new friend.

42:55.822 --> 42:58.523
- She's my girlfriend, dad.
- We'll see about that.

42:58.525 --> 43:01.861
Come on in, kids,
let's go have some juice.

43:05.131 --> 43:07.899
- That is a vampire.
- What?

43:07.901 --> 43:09.432
Olivia is not a vampire.

43:09.434 --> 43:10.867
I am not a vampire.

43:10.869 --> 43:11.771
Sure.

43:13.106 --> 43:16.874
Hey, Teddy, I got
more coupons for you.

43:16.876 --> 43:18.309
Thanks, Poppy.

43:18.311 --> 43:19.309
Hi.

43:19.311 --> 43:22.579
You must be Olivia.

43:22.581 --> 43:27.117
I'm Tete Carey, and this
is his uncle Bradley.

43:27.119 --> 43:30.588
The future president of the
United States of America.

43:30.590 --> 43:32.256
It's a
pleasure to meet you.

43:33.593 --> 43:35.059
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

43:35.061 --> 43:37.231
What in God's name.

43:38.331 --> 43:39.896
I'ma have a heart attack.

43:39.898 --> 43:42.365
I'm the one who's dying here,
not you.

43:42.367 --> 43:44.836
All you motherfuckers
care about is my will.

43:44.838 --> 43:47.972
Pop, you know how expensive
it is to become president.

43:47.974 --> 43:50.575
And what a good president
you'll be.

43:50.577 --> 43:53.410
America, boom!

43:53.412 --> 43:57.548
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Your hand's healed.

43:57.550 --> 43:59.983
The healing power
of your booty, baby.

43:59.985 --> 44:01.551
And, young lady, did you notice?

44:01.553 --> 44:03.521
I never once fondled
my wife's titties

44:03.523 --> 44:05.388
at the dining room table.

44:05.390 --> 44:06.490
I'm so proud of you.

44:06.492 --> 44:08.925
I'm proud of you.

44:08.927 --> 44:12.229
- Shut the fuck up.
- Oh, oh, oh Jeez...

44:12.231 --> 44:15.332
Shut up.

44:15.334 --> 44:16.934
Pops.

44:16.936 --> 44:19.269
You shut the fuck up too.

44:19.271 --> 44:20.573
Hey, Poppy.

44:21.608 --> 44:22.508
Poppy, look at me. Hey.

44:23.575 --> 44:25.411
Put the gun down.

44:35.121 --> 44:38.222
So, anybody else...

44:38.224 --> 44:39.657
Anybody else peckish?
Anybody hungry?

44:39.659 --> 44:41.258
I'm hungry, anybody?

44:41.260 --> 44:42.459
I could eat.

44:42.461 --> 44:44.562
Jean, what's for dinner?

44:44.564 --> 44:48.064
Hope it's not their casserole.
Tastes more like asserole.

44:48.066 --> 44:51.334
You people don't like
the food here, you can leave.

44:51.336 --> 44:53.403
Okay, do you hear me?

44:53.405 --> 44:56.843
I have just about enough
of all this bullshit.

44:58.211 --> 45:01.445
Ted, I don't know about
all this vampire,

45:01.447 --> 45:03.648
zombie nonsense,
whatever it is,

45:03.650 --> 45:05.983
but it's not gonna happen in my
family, you understand?

45:05.985 --> 45:08.919
- It's gonna stop right now.
- You're damn right.

45:08.921 --> 45:10.287
I'm still in charge
of this house.

45:10.289 --> 45:11.988
Wait, Olivia!

45:11.990 --> 45:15.528
Don't leave,
she's gonna bite you.

45:19.131 --> 45:21.200
She's gonna bite you.

45:25.637 --> 45:27.137
Olivia!

45:28.307 --> 45:29.376
Olivia!

45:45.390 --> 45:49.225
Olivia?

45:49.227 --> 45:50.130
Olivia!

46:20.093 --> 46:22.996
<i>Hi, this is Olivia, leave me a
message and I'll call you back</i>.

46:27.300 --> 46:32.202
Oh, shit!

46:48.787 --> 46:51.689
Olivia?

46:51.691 --> 46:53.627
Olivia!

46:56.762 --> 46:57.663
Olivia?

47:04.070 --> 47:05.305
Hello!

47:06.238 --> 47:10.274
You don't look so good.
Love got you down?

47:21.653 --> 47:26.189
Oh God, Olivia, there you are, I've
been looking all over for you.

47:26.191 --> 47:27.693
This place is so creepy.

47:32.465 --> 47:33.367
Are you okay?

47:34.834 --> 47:36.069
I mean, I have your shoe.

47:40.606 --> 47:43.673
Look, Olivia, I'm sorry, okay?
Please forgive me.

47:43.675 --> 47:44.710
I shouldn't have
taken you there.

47:45.644 --> 47:47.378
What is wrong with them?

47:47.380 --> 47:49.079
They're crazy.

47:49.081 --> 47:50.814
They think I'm a vampire.

47:50.816 --> 47:53.619
Yes, well,
they think I'm a zombie.

47:54.686 --> 47:57.521
My God, Ted,
you are a zombie, okay.

47:57.523 --> 48:00.457
You're in denial and I guess I'm
a fool for thinking I could

48:00.459 --> 48:03.429
trust a zombie, you're probably
just interested in my brains.

48:06.298 --> 48:08.599
Yes, well, for your information,
I think you're a vampire

48:08.601 --> 48:11.234
and I suppose all you're
interested in is my blood, right?

48:11.236 --> 48:12.769
Maybe.

48:12.771 --> 48:16.340
Then, go ahead, Olivia, bite me.

48:16.342 --> 48:17.610
Oh, I'm so tempted.

48:19.244 --> 48:21.245
Yes, well, I'm tempted
to eat your brains.

48:21.247 --> 48:24.618
Well, then go ahead, eat my brains,
Ted, you zombie, eat them.

48:40.432 --> 48:42.201
Are you okay,
Olivia, did I hurt you?

48:59.385 --> 49:00.517
No.

49:00.519 --> 49:01.885
I'm sorry.

49:01.887 --> 49:02.852
Olivia, are you okay?

49:02.854 --> 49:04.356
No, no, I'm okay.

49:07.660 --> 49:09.663
I would never want
to hurt you, okay.

49:11.197 --> 49:12.099
I love you.

49:13.365 --> 49:15.101
What the hell
are we gonna do?

49:16.202 --> 49:17.838
You're a zombie and I'm
a fucking vampire.

49:19.939 --> 49:23.774
Yes, well, I guess
it all make sense now.

49:23.776 --> 49:27.380
You understood why I'm tempted
to bite people's heads.

49:28.680 --> 49:31.184
I want to bite
your neck so bad.

49:35.421 --> 49:37.320
How did this happen?

49:37.322 --> 49:39.823
I don't want
to hurt anyone, Ted.

49:39.825 --> 49:41.258
Neither do I.

49:41.260 --> 49:42.660
Let's make a pact.

49:42.662 --> 49:44.898
Like a blood pact?

49:46.831 --> 49:49.233
No, probably
not a good idea.

49:49.235 --> 49:50.137
Pinky pact.

49:50.970 --> 49:52.736
Nobody has to die.

49:52.738 --> 49:55.372
Nobody that
isn't already dead.

49:55.374 --> 49:56.510
Right.

49:58.311 --> 49:59.778
Promise you'll
stay with me forever?

50:07.820 --> 50:10.724
Forever could be
a really long time for us.

50:13.425 --> 50:14.691
Yes.

50:25.972 --> 50:26.872
Thank you.

50:36.414 --> 50:37.316
Wolfgang?

50:38.416 --> 50:39.617
Hi, Wolfgang.

50:39.619 --> 50:40.553
Hey, Ted.

50:41.653 --> 50:42.588
Hey, Olivia.

50:52.999 --> 50:54.568
Watch out for the alligators.

50:57.003 --> 50:57.938
They're terrifying.

51:03.508 --> 51:04.543
I love you, Ted.

51:15.854 --> 51:18.757
Well, if it isn't
Lazy one and Lazy two.

51:20.626 --> 51:21.528
I don't get it.

51:22.727 --> 51:24.630
It's a Dr. Seuss
reference, dipshit.

51:27.032 --> 51:29.633
Anyway, I'm just coming by to
make sure some work is getting

51:29.635 --> 51:33.771
done around here, that nobody's
being a zombie.

51:46.352 --> 51:47.454
Zombie!

51:48.753 --> 51:51.323
That is funny stuff,
come on.

52:01.434 --> 52:04.568
Best worker competition's right
around the corner, you know.

52:04.570 --> 52:06.537
Best worker, best worker.

52:06.539 --> 52:07.439
Over here.

52:08.506 --> 52:11.341
Yes, I am working so ultra hard.

52:11.343 --> 52:12.675
It is exhausting.

52:12.677 --> 52:14.546
Seriously.

52:16.014 --> 52:17.680
What?

52:17.682 --> 52:18.651
What are you working on?

52:19.753 --> 52:22.488
Me? I'm working on the numbers
for stateside, sir.

52:24.023 --> 52:24.923
And?

52:27.425 --> 52:30.526
Spreadsheet for your
afternoon meeting, sir.

52:30.528 --> 52:31.430
Very good.

52:32.532 --> 52:34.765
Better be careful, you just
might win best worker.

52:34.767 --> 52:35.669
No, that's me.

52:37.001 --> 52:39.503
I'm really not
worried about that.

52:39.505 --> 52:40.604
Nor should you be.

52:40.606 --> 52:42.472
You're gonna lose.

52:44.677 --> 52:45.745
So funny...

52:46.845 --> 52:48.379
I get it.

52:48.381 --> 52:51.148
- Funny guy.
- You're the boss. Funny.

52:51.150 --> 52:55.151
Hey. I think I deserve
a little respect around here.

52:55.153 --> 52:58.454
You might want to comb your
hair once in a while, Ted.

52:58.456 --> 52:59.358
What?

53:00.226 --> 53:01.825
Anyway, seems
like you two are getting

53:01.827 --> 53:04.794
along pretty well with my
new secretary, Bonnie.

53:04.796 --> 53:06.365
Yes, she's really nice.

53:09.001 --> 53:12.568
Just not so sure
how smart old Bon-Bon is,

53:12.570 --> 53:14.470
you know what I'm saying?

53:14.472 --> 53:16.840
You don't know
how smart she is?

53:16.842 --> 53:22.012
Frank, what is that?

53:22.014 --> 53:24.515
I mean, what is that?

53:24.517 --> 53:26.086
Is that another one
of your stupid jokes?

53:28.653 --> 53:31.954
You can call me
Lazy one or Lazy two or any

53:31.956 --> 53:36.760
other names that you want,
but you leave Bonnie alone.

53:36.762 --> 53:39.032
Bonnie is not the best worker.

53:40.965 --> 53:42.899
I suggest you watch
how you talk

53:42.901 --> 53:44.403
to me if you want to
keep your job.

53:45.871 --> 53:47.704
You can call me Mr. Lee.

53:47.706 --> 53:49.439
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

53:49.441 --> 53:50.941
I've found your loofa.

53:50.943 --> 53:53.142
Also need you to sign
a few things for me.

53:53.144 --> 53:57.150
Hey, you might want to tell your
boyfriend here to watch his...

53:59.751 --> 54:00.786
ass.

54:08.126 --> 54:10.093
What was that all about?

54:10.095 --> 54:13.700
Well, old Ricky here
just kicked Frank Lee's...

54:14.767 --> 54:16.733
ass, is what he did.

54:16.735 --> 54:18.167
- Really?
- Yes.

54:18.169 --> 54:20.572
That is pretty sexy.

54:22.541 --> 54:23.907
Are you coming to lunch?

54:23.909 --> 54:26.075
Yes, I'll meet
you guys over there.

54:36.055 --> 54:39.490
Ted, you've got to
help me get Bonnie to

54:39.492 --> 54:42.162
the basement for
a surprise before Monday.

54:43.162 --> 54:46.666
What's the surprise now
and what's going on Monday?

54:47.932 --> 54:49.633
I'll get that.

54:49.635 --> 54:53.640
Monday is when they
announce best worker.

54:55.874 --> 55:00.209
You know Bonnie's deciding that, right? Is
that why you want to give her something?

55:00.211 --> 55:05.649
What? Then she will... Then
she'll ultra choose herself.

55:05.651 --> 55:08.952
- This is...
- No. No, Mel, she can't choose herself.

55:08.954 --> 55:10.553
She can't be best worker.

55:10.555 --> 55:12.289
She has to count all the votes,

55:12.291 --> 55:15.995
and then if there's a tie, she
gets to decide who wins it.

55:21.133 --> 55:23.700
That is not...

55:23.702 --> 55:27.704
So not what I thought.

55:27.706 --> 55:31.975
This is ultra interesting,
see you later.

55:31.977 --> 55:32.912
What?

55:51.564 --> 55:52.632
Can I have that?

55:53.865 --> 55:54.566
Sure.

55:56.769 --> 55:59.236
There's something
I need to say.

55:59.238 --> 56:02.606
I know all of you have known for
a while now, but

56:02.608 --> 56:03.943
I am a zombie.

56:06.711 --> 56:08.345
A zombie?

56:08.347 --> 56:11.918
Yep, a zombie named Ted.

56:14.586 --> 56:16.523
I'm feeling
pretty dumb these days.

56:17.756 --> 56:21.261
Excellent, Grendel,
I am so happy for you.

56:22.927 --> 56:23.896
I am a vampire.

56:25.064 --> 56:25.965
I knew that.

56:30.302 --> 56:36.039
These lollipops I always suck on,
I make them myself out of blood.

56:38.910 --> 56:40.746
See, I knew you guys would
think that was gross.

56:42.881 --> 56:46.586
Ted, how is this knowledge affecting
the way you feel about Olivia?

56:48.621 --> 56:49.722
Doesn't matter to me.

56:54.093 --> 56:56.996
I have the cutest
patients.

57:00.331 --> 57:02.399
I guess eating
bloody pops isn't

57:02.401 --> 57:04.166
as a big deal
as I thought it was.

57:04.168 --> 57:05.702
Do you have to
call them that?

57:05.704 --> 57:07.137
Where do you
get the blood from?

57:07.139 --> 57:10.140
The hospital usually,
the morgue too.

57:12.910 --> 57:14.244
Hey, are you okay?

57:32.064 --> 57:33.930
That's actually
a really good idea, honey.

57:33.932 --> 57:35.767
- That way, no one has to die.
- Yes.

57:37.836 --> 57:40.937
Your little ploy of making
me slip on ice cream down

57:40.939 --> 57:44.944
the steps may have worked,
Candy, but I am still alive.

57:46.110 --> 57:49.445
Not only that, but the handsome
doctor who bandaged me up

57:49.447 --> 57:52.682
was none other than your
high school sweetheart.

57:52.684 --> 57:54.184
The one that got away.

57:54.186 --> 57:57.356
We made passionate love
when he was done.

57:59.957 --> 58:02.124
None of my
patients listen to me.

58:02.126 --> 58:06.398
Mr. Van Tadan, can you please
go back to my office right now.

58:09.267 --> 58:10.168
Please.

58:15.139 --> 58:17.374
I don't need you, Norah.

58:17.376 --> 58:18.941
Yes, you do.

58:18.943 --> 58:20.477
- I don't. No.
- You do. Yes.

58:20.479 --> 58:22.715
- I don't!
- You do!

58:23.948 --> 58:25.385
I don't need you!

58:26.318 --> 58:28.251
Yes, you do.

58:28.253 --> 58:29.789
I don't.

58:40.499 --> 58:42.966
How's my
favorite secretary doing?

58:42.968 --> 58:45.001
About to put in her notice.

58:45.003 --> 58:47.236
Say what, why?

58:47.238 --> 58:50.242
I applied for
Frank's job and I got it.

58:51.175 --> 58:56.345
They've been grooming her
for this, and Frank has no idea.

58:59.383 --> 59:02.519
- Oh, man!
- We all deserve some changes around here.

59:02.521 --> 59:04.521
What's today?

59:04.523 --> 59:06.155
Monday.

59:06.157 --> 59:08.325
It's a trick question.

59:08.327 --> 59:11.294
Today is the day that
someone ultra special

59:11.296 --> 59:14.131
gets the trophy for
the best worker.

59:14.133 --> 59:15.532
I hope you get it.

59:15.534 --> 59:17.934
Hey, you know,
I voted for you, Mel.

59:17.936 --> 59:19.035
So did I.

59:19.037 --> 59:21.037
I like zombies.

59:21.039 --> 59:22.972
Just don't eat my brains, Ted.

59:22.974 --> 59:25.508
I don't want to
eat your brains, Mel.

59:25.510 --> 59:28.313
Guys, I don't want to
hurt anybody.

59:29.314 --> 59:32.115
All right, look, I realize
I've been in denial.

59:32.117 --> 59:34.283
And this is more than
just a skin thing.

59:34.285 --> 59:38.256
Obviously, I am a zombie.

59:40.291 --> 59:42.160
I'm sorry for freaking
you guys out so much.

59:45.430 --> 59:48.131
Well, I guess
now is as a good a time

59:48.133 --> 59:51.100
as any to hand out the
best worker trophy.

59:51.102 --> 59:52.003
Yes.

59:53.372 --> 59:56.840
Okay, Frank Lee
asked me to do the

59:56.842 --> 59:59.809
presentation, so if everyone
would gather around.

59:59.811 --> 01:00:01.878
The votes have been
tallied and so without

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.983
further ado, the best
worker award goes to...

01:00:06.985 --> 01:00:08.017
Mel!

01:00:13.992 --> 01:00:15.925
Thank God, I got the award.

01:00:15.927 --> 01:00:20.198
Me trying to do...
I'm so happy.

01:00:21.099 --> 01:00:23.566
- Okay, Mel. Okay, Mel!
- Thank you.

01:00:23.568 --> 01:00:26.403
Here you go,
you certainly deserve this.

01:00:26.405 --> 01:00:29.840
- You are a very hard worker.
- You feel good, thank you.

01:00:29.842 --> 01:00:33.577
I don't think anybody else deserves
this award more than you do.

01:00:33.579 --> 01:00:34.577
Thank you.

01:00:35.847 --> 01:00:37.215
Congrats.

01:00:39.151 --> 01:00:43.289
Police!
Police with captives.

01:00:48.994 --> 01:00:50.463
Melthius Corpus Lithium.

01:00:54.365 --> 01:00:55.267
That's me.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.402
What kind
of name is that?

01:00:58.336 --> 01:01:01.238
- Oh, well... It's Californian.
- Oh.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.640
- Yeah.
- Make sense.

01:01:03.642 --> 01:01:06.008
Now maybe you can tell us
why we found these missing

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:08.044
people locked in a room in the
basement of this building?

01:01:08.046 --> 01:01:09.148
Yeah.

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:14.984
Well, they got food.
I gave them food.

01:01:14.986 --> 01:01:16.452
The food
actually wasn't that bad.

01:01:16.454 --> 01:01:18.387
We've got a rodent problem
down there.

01:01:18.389 --> 01:01:19.890
It also gets
really cold at night.

01:01:19.892 --> 01:01:21.024
It does
get cold, it got cold.

01:01:21.026 --> 01:01:22.626
I gave them blankets.

01:01:22.628 --> 01:01:26.329
And they were thin.
No, thanks. They were thin.

01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:32.301
To be fair, Mel did get me
a lovely birthday gift.

01:01:32.303 --> 01:01:34.907
That was super.
Thank you.

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:39.910
Yes, but these peoples' families
have been missing them.

01:01:39.912 --> 01:01:45.551
Well, they can all go home now
because I'm best worker now.

01:01:46.584 --> 01:01:48.251
Thanks, hold the applause.

01:01:48.253 --> 01:01:51.521
Hold on, that's
what this is all about?

01:01:51.523 --> 01:01:53.689
You locked these people
in a basement so that

01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:57.028
- they couldn't win the best worker trophy?
- Uh, yeah.

01:01:58.262 --> 01:01:59.528
- Give me that trophy.
- No, no.

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:02.499
- No, no...
- Yes.

01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:06.005
You don't deserve it.
Thank you.

01:02:07.005 --> 01:02:10.439
Mel, you can't win best worker if
you lock people up in a basement.

01:02:10.441 --> 01:02:13.008
- I didn't know that.
- Does anyone know

01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:15.146
what Jimi Hendrix is saying
in <i>Purple Haze?</i>

01:02:17.682 --> 01:02:19.184
Never mind all that.

01:02:20.452 --> 01:02:23.119
Melthius, none of these people
have decided to press charges.

01:02:23.121 --> 01:02:25.457
Which means, we are not
going to arrest you today.

01:02:26.457 --> 01:02:29.492
But I suggest you don't do anything
like this ever again, you hear me?

01:02:29.494 --> 01:02:31.695
I hear you.
Hear you.

01:02:31.697 --> 01:02:33.595
Mel, and
whoever is going to be

01:02:33.597 --> 01:02:36.099
the one that wins the
best worker trophy,

01:02:36.101 --> 01:02:39.336
it's gonna be a person who doesn't
lock their co-workers in a basement.

01:02:39.338 --> 01:02:41.437
- Yeah.
- Sorry, guys.

01:02:41.439 --> 01:02:44.006
Sometimes other people
have to win the trophy.

01:02:44.008 --> 01:02:46.309
Mel, if I can be a zombie
and not eat people, I think

01:02:46.311 --> 01:02:48.477
you can be the best worker
here and not lock people up.

01:02:48.479 --> 01:02:50.113
Zombie.

01:02:50.115 --> 01:02:51.747
All right, yes, I'm
a zombie, all right.

01:02:51.749 --> 01:02:53.283
Get over it.

01:02:53.285 --> 01:02:55.417
Let's get
out of here, sergeant.

01:02:55.419 --> 01:02:56.352
Bye.

01:02:56.354 --> 01:02:57.456
Be good.

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:03.061
Captives be gone.

01:03:21.079 --> 01:03:23.950
All right Poppy old man,
let's get this party started.

01:03:24.782 --> 01:03:27.719
I will go first
as first lady.

01:03:28.753 --> 01:03:32.021
Carey always got to be first.

01:03:32.023 --> 01:03:35.591
Dear Carey, though you
are no direct relation to me,

01:03:35.593 --> 01:03:39.428
and I don't think you got
much in the way of brains.

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:41.765
Shut up, you old fool.
Shut up, Poppy.

01:03:41.767 --> 01:03:43.666
You go ahead, baby.

01:03:43.668 --> 01:03:46.037
I think you
and your dumb husband...

01:03:47.072 --> 01:03:48.470
Dumb, son of a bitch.

01:03:48.472 --> 01:03:51.441
Look, I'm sorry.
Keep reading, sweetheart.

01:03:51.443 --> 01:03:53.742
...should go
to the White House.

01:03:53.744 --> 01:03:56.081
Where a bunch of other
dummies have lived

01:03:56.782 --> 01:03:59.651
so I've left you enough
money to do that.

01:04:01.485 --> 01:04:03.385
There is a bag
with your name on it.

01:04:06.258 --> 01:04:08.725
Take that,
all you naysayers.

01:04:08.727 --> 01:04:11.628
America or boom!

01:04:14.099 --> 01:04:16.235
It's a funeral
for God's sakes.

01:04:17.735 --> 01:04:20.070
Okay,
I get it, I get it.

01:04:20.072 --> 01:04:23.372
Excuse me, everybody,
for boning my wife

01:04:23.374 --> 01:04:25.343
in front of the ashes
of your dead daddy.

01:04:26.445 --> 01:04:30.713
I think my gorgeous wife
deserves the honor to read ours.

01:04:30.715 --> 01:04:33.082
By the way, you look
mighty pretty today.

01:04:33.084 --> 01:04:36.852
Thank you, baby, but I
can't take all the credit.

01:04:36.854 --> 01:04:42.660
I've been using Infinite Naturals and
it has been clearing up my skin.

01:04:44.095 --> 01:04:45.628
It is good for the hands,

01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:48.401
the face, and every bumpy place.

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:53.470
- Infinite Naturals...
- ...is naturally infinite.

01:04:56.273 --> 01:04:57.442
Here we go.

01:04:59.543 --> 01:05:04.582
Dear, Jorge, that wife
of yours can't cook.

01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:10.320
I was never proud of
you, son, but you tried.

01:05:10.322 --> 01:05:17.227
Irregardless, fuckers, I'm
leaving you and Jean a bag.

01:05:17.229 --> 01:05:19.595
Hallelujah.
Thank you, Jesus.

01:05:19.597 --> 01:05:22.499
Well, Pops, you
were a pain in the ass

01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:24.637
till the end,
but I'm gonna miss you.

01:05:25.537 --> 01:05:29.539
Darling...
This is it.

01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:33.809
Money in that bag.

01:05:33.811 --> 01:05:35.447
Welcome to the rich club.

01:05:36.715 --> 01:05:38.684
Go ahead, son.
It's your turn.

01:05:42.354 --> 01:05:47.393
Dear, Ted, you were the only
one that I loved, except Linda.

01:05:49.727 --> 01:05:51.727
But there at the end,
you were a zombie,

01:05:51.729 --> 01:05:54.132
and I just can't
tolerate that.

01:05:56.468 --> 01:05:58.471
So, no money for you,

01:06:00.771 --> 01:06:04.142
but I did leave you some coupons
to help with expenses.

01:06:05.709 --> 01:06:07.676
- Luck!
- Sorry, son.

01:06:07.678 --> 01:06:08.881
My turn.

01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:15.584
My darling Linda,
love of my life.

01:06:15.586 --> 01:06:18.887
The biggest bag is
of course for you

01:06:18.889 --> 01:06:22.225
and will allow you to
finish your sorcery training

01:06:22.227 --> 01:06:27.363
and do any other damn thing you
please, forever in my memory.

01:06:27.365 --> 01:06:29.602
That's some
bullshit right there.

01:06:31.369 --> 01:06:32.801
There is my new boyfriend.

01:06:32.803 --> 01:06:34.903
I'll be practicing
my newest love spell

01:06:34.905 --> 01:06:37.275
on him
right about now.

01:06:40.544 --> 01:06:42.445
Tata, everyone.

01:06:42.447 --> 01:06:44.513
Don't miss me too much.

01:06:51.423 --> 01:06:53.726
Thank God that bitch is gone.

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:13.779
What was that?

01:07:16.581 --> 01:07:18.615
Poppy blew that woman up.

01:07:19.617 --> 01:07:21.251
Red flag.

01:07:21.253 --> 01:07:23.452
God may not be here
when you want Him,

01:07:23.454 --> 01:07:25.490
but He's always right on time.

01:07:28.626 --> 01:07:30.762
I think we can
all agree with my bitch.

01:07:32.597 --> 01:07:35.798
Let's check out the loot.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.504
Wait, wait!
Be careful now.

01:07:39.704 --> 01:07:40.606
I think it's safe.

01:07:43.441 --> 01:07:45.575
Yes, yes, yes.

01:07:45.577 --> 01:07:49.912
No, stop! Stop celebrating.
It's fake.

01:07:49.914 --> 01:07:52.251
- It's fake.
- Oh, no. No, no, no!

01:07:53.651 --> 01:07:55.017
Oh, my God.

01:07:55.019 --> 01:07:56.686
No, no, no.

01:07:59.057 --> 01:08:03.526
I wish I could burn
your ass up more right now.

01:08:03.528 --> 01:08:06.296
Be strong.
Baby, be strong.

01:08:06.298 --> 01:08:11.066
I wanted to get daddy
so much hatred.

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:15.704
What's to come
of our country?

01:08:15.706 --> 01:08:20.376
I was gonna get you a
prosthetic and surprise you.

01:08:20.377 --> 01:08:24.845
This is not
what George Washington died for.

01:08:24.848 --> 01:08:28.082
I wanted you
to hold me with both arms.

01:08:30.621 --> 01:08:32.921
I can't hold myself.

01:08:40.831 --> 01:08:42.700
I am sensitive
to Infinite Naturals.

01:08:43.968 --> 01:08:45.371
Oh God.

01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:51.876
It isn't
the end of the world.

01:08:53.812 --> 01:08:54.712
Yes, it is.

01:08:56.747 --> 01:09:00.048
Listen, I am not
gonna mistreat you, OK?

01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:01.486
What good would that do?

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.658
I want you to care about
your job, and work hard.

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:09.761
If you can learn to do that,
and treat people better,

01:09:11.062 --> 01:09:14.032
sure we can find a place
for you in some capacity.

01:09:15.032 --> 01:09:16.301
In some capacity?

01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:23.942
What? Like the janitor,
or pool boy?

01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:26.841
We have a pool here?

01:09:26.844 --> 01:09:29.078
We don't have a pool here.

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.916
Listen, why don't you take a
week off, and when you get

01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:38.589
back, we can sit down and find
a place that fits for you.

01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:42.594
I'm sure you have some family who
would want to see more of you.

01:09:45.696 --> 01:09:46.697
No, I don't.

01:09:49.867 --> 01:09:52.103
I think it would help
if you took some time off.

01:09:54.472 --> 01:09:55.374
Oh, gosh.

01:09:58.576 --> 01:10:00.012
Frank, do you want a hug?

01:10:01.879 --> 01:10:03.681
Okay, come on.
Bring it in.

01:10:09.987 --> 01:10:11.055
Okay.

01:10:13.191 --> 01:10:14.626
Look, you are
sitting in my chair.

01:10:23.867 --> 01:10:25.704
I'm gonna need you to get up.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.854
Let me see what kind of
coupons he gave you.

01:10:44.856 --> 01:10:48.393
That's for
cereal or something.

01:10:51.228 --> 01:10:52.164
Oh, look at that.

01:10:53.531 --> 01:10:57.166
There is a letter in here for you
from your grandfather, dumb ass.

01:10:57.168 --> 01:11:00.539
- You want to see what it says?
- Th...

01:11:01.973 --> 01:11:05.041
<i> Dear Teddy, you
didn't really think I'd only leave you</i>

01:11:05.043 --> 01:11:08.080
<i>a cereal coupon,
did you? You fucking tool.</i>

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.815
<i>You've known your whole life what the
rest of those idiots will never know</i>

01:11:12.817 --> 01:11:16.822
<i>which is money can't buy you love.
You will know what to do with this.</i>

01:11:17.789 --> 01:11:22.091
<i>I have enclosed Dan Bishop's business card.
He's the man at Dintuck & Blitzer Bank</i>

01:11:22.093 --> 01:11:23.860
<i>and will help you
access your money.</i>

01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:25.560
<i>Don't let me down, buddy.</i>

01:11:25.562 --> 01:11:28.998
<i>Love forever, your Poppy.</i>

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.168
- Ted!
- Are you kidding me?

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:34.002
Wow.
I can't believe this.

01:11:34.004 --> 01:11:37.172
Dang, Ted. You might just be
the richest zombie alive.

01:11:37.174 --> 01:11:39.878
The richest zombie...
alive?

01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:45.017
I'm the richest
zombie dead... named Ted.

01:11:47.285 --> 01:11:48.653
My God.

01:11:50.088 --> 01:11:51.220
Come on, guys.

01:11:54.259 --> 01:11:55.925
So crazy.

01:14:22.173 --> 01:14:24.073
- Marker.
- , zombie.

01:14:24.075 --> 01:14:26.307
Please don't hurt me.

01:14:26.309 --> 01:14:29.310
Can you start?
Now you could think about it.

01:14:29.312 --> 01:14:30.846
Oh my God.
Mel, Mel!

01:14:36.888 --> 01:14:38.820
20 crackers.
Take four.

01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:41.360
You're dumb, Ted.
Sorry.

01:14:42.427 --> 01:14:45.394
- I'm just...
- Sick and tired?

01:14:45.396 --> 01:14:47.962
Give me a sec, okay.

01:14:47.964 --> 01:14:49.333
I'm in love with you.

01:14:50.468 --> 01:14:52.467
Okay.
I'll get this.

01:14:52.469 --> 01:14:56.139
Look, I'm just sick and tired
of people calling me a zombie.

01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:01.043
Excuse me.

01:15:01.045 --> 01:15:02.410
Oh my God.

01:15:02.412 --> 01:15:04.980
- Before you have sex.
- Mel!

01:15:04.982 --> 01:15:06.315
Could you please,
hand me my sandwich.

01:15:06.317 --> 01:15:07.949
- No.
- I think she's lying on it.

01:15:07.951 --> 01:15:09.752
- How the...
- Scene three Echo, take one.

01:15:09.754 --> 01:15:11.252
- rolling.
- I forgot my line.

01:15:11.254 --> 01:15:12.156
Damn it.

01:15:14.791 --> 01:15:16.092
Oh, sorry.

01:15:21.499 --> 01:15:26.101
I think I just need to... I need to
write down another note with myself.

01:15:26.103 --> 01:15:29.872
Where is it? My pen, damn it,
Ted, did you eat my pen?

01:15:29.874 --> 01:15:32.010
- Rolling.
- Marker.

01:15:32.977 --> 01:15:36.412
I'm sorry, I'm laughing.
I'm sorry.

01:15:36.414 --> 01:15:38.717
Marker.

01:15:44.321 --> 01:15:45.222
Marker.

01:15:49.826 --> 01:15:50.728
Hi, Ricky.

01:15:51.963 --> 01:15:52.997
Hi, Ricky.

01:15:57.235 --> 01:16:01.106
So Ricky's there? So, seriously,
are you still rolling or what?

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.277
- What? sorry.
- It's okay.

01:16:06.244 --> 01:16:09.145
Oh my God. You see what you did?
You broke it.

01:16:09.147 --> 01:16:11.180
- Can I help...
- No, no you can't.

01:16:11.182 --> 01:16:14.086
That was because your moral
character was not sound enough.

01:16:47.117 --> 01:16:50.819
Bravo 5 Kilo, take one.
Marker.

01:16:50.821 --> 01:16:54.523
Now, quick making those wishes.
What are they? Give them to me.

01:16:54.525 --> 01:16:59.928
The wishes would be,
I wish she would.

01:16:59.930 --> 01:17:01.297
That's not three wishes.

01:17:01.299 --> 01:17:03.199
- No.
- That's four words.

01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:05.501
I wish sh'would.

01:17:05.503 --> 01:17:07.203
Must be deaf then.

01:17:07.205 --> 01:17:09.941
- What did you say?
- I said we need a shift.

01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:14.976
You know, I just realized
that sh'would is not a word.

01:17:14.978 --> 01:17:17.546
- So, what makes you think that I'm a zombie?
- I just get the feeling

01:17:17.548 --> 01:17:21.350
- that you're gonna eat my head at any second.
- That's a very false...

01:17:21.352 --> 01:17:24.520
- It's called zombie-ism as far as I know.
- Yeah, but that's...

01:17:24.522 --> 01:17:26.521
Look at the way you're
looking at my noggin right now.

01:17:26.523 --> 01:17:27.590
Scene 19.

01:17:27.592 --> 01:17:28.891
Excuse me for fondling

01:17:28.893 --> 01:17:29.958
my wife's areola

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.093
at the dining, okay.

01:17:32.095 --> 01:17:34.128
What is the
areola specifically?

01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:35.499
It's this part right here.

01:17:36.901 --> 01:17:38.499
Just keep your
teeth off my body.

01:17:38.501 --> 01:17:41.236
No, she looks a little
like a vampire but she's...

01:17:41.238 --> 01:17:46.007
- What?
- Calm down.

01:17:46.009 --> 01:17:49.410
- Rolling.
- What? What? What? What? What?

01:17:49.412 --> 01:17:52.114
Huh?
Well, I didn't...

01:17:52.116 --> 01:17:54.382
Excuse me
for giving my wife a

01:17:54.384 --> 01:17:56.886
clinical breast exam
at the dinner table.

01:17:56.888 --> 01:17:58.823
I thought we were family.

01:18:01.826 --> 01:18:04.293
You need to do that
on a regular basis.

01:18:04.295 --> 01:18:09.899
- These aren't going to mammogram themselves.
- That's true.

01:18:09.901 --> 01:18:12.200
Then of course I'm
gonna outlaw anybody

01:18:12.202 --> 01:18:14.539
who comes from a country
that has a ach sound in it.

01:18:15.572 --> 01:18:16.971
- Roll.
- Marker.

01:18:16.973 --> 01:18:19.440
- We can not do this?
- No.

01:18:19.442 --> 01:18:23.212
- Can I do that?
- No.

01:18:23.214 --> 01:18:25.346
Ted, just tell me
when it's okay.

01:18:25.348 --> 01:18:29.485
- I can do this?
- Quit grabbing that. Please stop.

01:18:29.487 --> 01:18:31.486
None of us want to see that.

01:18:31.488 --> 01:18:34.025
Grandpa rolling.

01:18:38.495 --> 01:18:41.596
What's to
come of our country?

01:18:45.036 --> 01:18:48.337
All the little
American boys and girls.

01:18:48.339 --> 01:18:49.637
Stay strong, baby.

01:18:49.639 --> 01:18:51.942
With no apple pie.

01:19:01.184 --> 01:19:02.517
Shut up there, old man.

01:19:02.519 --> 01:19:04.653
You see that you done?

01:19:04.655 --> 01:19:07.556
- I hate you.
- Roll.

01:19:17.268 --> 01:19:19.435
AAZNT

01:19:19.437 --> 01:19:22.540
My family has
gone to hell and back.

01:19:24.308 --> 01:19:26.608
What is happening?

01:19:30.481 --> 01:19:35.551
Shoot me. Shoot me, motherfuckers,
just shoot me right in the head.

01:19:35.553 --> 01:19:38.087
Take me out there.
Take me.

01:20:57.268 --> 01:20:58.169
Take one.

01:21:18.856 --> 01:21:21.155
I am a zombie.

01:21:21.157 --> 01:21:22.059
A zombie named Ted.

01:21:23.626 --> 01:21:24.528
Ted?

01:23:15.305 --> 01:23:16.206
So sad.

01:23:17.241 --> 01:23:19.777
Mr. Oripori, I told you
to wait in my office.
