00:40.999 --> 00:44.674
Woman: All I've ever wanted is
sparkling silven/vare,

00:44.836 --> 00:48.340
beautiful crystal,
and someone to love.

00:53.178 --> 00:57.524
Because to love and be loved
is the greatest gift.

01:10.696 --> 01:14.371
Cooking is supposed to
make you feel something.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.248
And if it makes you feel loved,

01:21.665 --> 01:24.464
then that's
the most important thing.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.821
Man: Amy, you're on
in three, two...

02:29.941 --> 02:32.945
Woman: There is no love
as true as the love of food.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.784
You with me?

02:34.905 --> 02:39.877
I like to say-- forget love,
I'd rather fall in chocolate.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.921
Mmmm.

02:43.705 --> 02:47.676
The secret to a man's heart
is not through his stomach,

02:47.834 --> 02:50.178
it's through his zipper.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.181
Now, one of you
lucky audience members

02:53.340 --> 02:59.814
is gonna join me for a meal
that will inspire you to orgasm.

03:01.139 --> 03:07.067
Because that's what we do
on Amy's Food For Love.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.856
(knocking)

03:09.481 --> 03:11.074
Shit.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.080
No solicitors, please.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.742
I'm Detective Reynolds.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.002
I'd like to ask you
some questions.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.761
It's about your neighbour.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.922
I'd just like to ask
a couple questions.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.262
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.353
It looks like you might
be entertaining.

03:43.515 --> 03:46.564
It's just a chocolate soufflé.
It'll be ready in ten minutes.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.697
Oh, I don't do much dessert,
doctor's orders.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.277
I won't tell if you won't.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.443
Mmm...

03:54.609 --> 03:55.656
Glass of Bordeaux?

03:55.819 --> 03:57.571
Can't drink on the job,
but thank you.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.705
Hmm.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.325
So, uh, your neighbour
across the way in 302.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.619
She's, uh,
come up missing.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.836
Saffron?

04:04.995 --> 04:05.996
She's a friend of yours?

04:06.163 --> 04:08.006
Well, I wouldn't say
that we share secrets,

04:08.165 --> 04:09.758
but we look out
for each other.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.341
She didn't say anything to you
to lead you to believe

04:13.462 --> 04:15.715
she was distressed,
maybe a fight with a lover?

04:15.881 --> 04:18.259
She seemed fine
the last time I saw her.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.351
Uh-huh.
And when was that?

04:21.178 --> 04:22.225
Umm...

04:23.013 --> 04:25.107
we had dinner
last week.

04:25.223 --> 04:28.193
Did she have
any friends over or parties?

04:28.351 --> 04:31.355
No, actually,
Saffron's pretty solitary.

04:31.521 --> 04:35.116
Oh, a pretty girl like that.
And famous, I understand.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.869
Though I don't go
to the movies much myself.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.246
Well, like I said, I don't know much
about her private life.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.958
This is Saffron Nelson?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.667
Maybe. It's hard to see.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.083
She's an actress,
so every time you see her, she's a...

04:51.249 --> 04:52.375
different person.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.717
So you've had
no contact with her

04:55.879 --> 04:58.598
since your dinner
together?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.894
You don't seem
too concerned.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.180
Well, how do we know
that she's missing?

05:04.304 --> 05:07.399
Look, Miss Elwood,
maybe I should be the detective here.

05:07.557 --> 05:11.437
I think it'll all make sense
in the grand scheme of things.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.911
- Do you mind?
- Oh.

05:24.074 --> 05:29.626
So, last week, did you cook
for her here or did you order in?

05:29.788 --> 05:32.541
Order in?
God, never.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.465
Um, hmm, let's see.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.304
Oh--

05:39.256 --> 05:42.601
Shafer Farm's venison loin
with parsnip gratin

05:42.759 --> 05:44.261
and onion confit.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.605
Do you keep track of
everything you cook?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.857
Do you keep track
of everything you ask?

05:49.015 --> 05:52.485
I do everything I make
on a special occasion.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.112
Are you a chef?

05:54.271 --> 05:56.319
I'm preparing
my own cooking show.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.234
Will you be writing up
your little cakes?

05:59.401 --> 06:00.368
Soufflé.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.155
And I don't know
if they're special enough yet.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.916
Would you know of any other
friends of Miss Nelson

06:07.075 --> 06:09.624
that I could
possibly call?

06:09.786 --> 06:12.710
Honestly, detective,
I don't know if she has any.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.920
If you think
of anything,

06:14.082 --> 06:16.460
please feel free
to contact me...

06:17.460 --> 06:18.757
personally.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.015
Sure thing.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.303
God, I can't believe
anything's happened to her.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.330
In the throes of passion,
who gives the most?

07:34.496 --> 07:35.964
The man or the woman?

07:36.122 --> 07:38.090
Amy: Not the man,
that's for sure.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.590
That's a great article,
one of her best.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.381
Looks like she had
many talents.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.553
She was tired of acting.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.888
That's why she wrote
the advice columns.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.429
She was tired of being
dependent on others.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.347
She said that to you?

07:52.514 --> 07:53.640
In so many words.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.025
Suicide.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.359
Is that possible?

07:57.519 --> 08:02.116
And how is it that a woman
who looks like that had no lovers?

08:02.273 --> 08:05.117
She gets a lot of phone calls
but she never answers.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.404
She changes her number
all the time.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.617
(phone ringing)

08:08.780 --> 08:11.750
Used to bother my fiancé 'cause
you could hear it through the walls.

08:11.908 --> 08:15.538
-(phone ringing)
-(beep)

08:16.663 --> 08:18.210
Saffron, honey,
it's Christine.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.920
I just spoke with
their casting director.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.335
It's not looking good.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.211
They need more
name value, A list,

08:23.378 --> 08:24.925
you know the bullshit.
Call--

08:30.218 --> 08:31.140
Okay, okay.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.727
(muffled chatter)

08:39.394 --> 08:41.488
It's a beast.

08:41.645 --> 08:45.276
Might have to eighty-six
the damn door frame.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.285
Everything
looks wonderful.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.867
The treated concrete,
the stainless,

08:50.030 --> 08:52.579
my kitchen lights,
remote control.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.118
Well, you don't want
to strain yourself.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.537
You went all out
for me, babe.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.959
But this is all wrong.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.840
Isn't it standard?

09:00.999 --> 09:03.047
It's not forty.
It should be forty.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.597
Amy, darling,
thirty-six is standard.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.349
They gave you
standard height.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.969
I like to be elevated when cooking,
if you know what I mean.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.809
Heels add four inches,
so the island has to come up by four.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.644
So spare no detail,
spare no expense.

09:16.806 --> 09:17.898
Do you remember, Fred?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.060
The kitchen
is my temple.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.608
Yeah, cash-guzzling temple.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.773
Here ya go, guy.
Come on.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.191
I gotta go-

09:26.357 --> 09:28.030
You know why
I love you, babe?

09:28.193 --> 09:30.571
'Cause when we went to
our first dinner at Le Gourmand,

09:30.737 --> 09:33.456
you said you could never be
with a woman who can't cook.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.741
And what did I say?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.876
You said that you could
never be with someone

09:37.035 --> 09:40.164
who didn't appreciate
a meal 'made with love'.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.502
I'm so glad you're
understanding.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.502
So you'll get him to finish it
in three days, right'?

09:44.667 --> 09:47.136
I got him this far, didn't I?

09:49.339 --> 09:50.340
Dinner's at eight.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.390
Amy: Sorry about all the noise.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.805
Let me guess. Model?

10:02.143 --> 10:04.362
More of a diva, I'd say.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.848
(phone ringing)

10:48.273 --> 10:50.275
I need you at eight sharp,
no delays.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.739
The integrity of the meal
can't tolerate it.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.205
Because today
on the menu, we have...

10:55.363 --> 10:56.831
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Surprise me, babe.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.742
You know I know
how to do that.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.581
Right. Can't wait.

11:00.702 --> 11:01.828
Bye.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.340
Mmm.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.051
You know, sometimes
I have to dig real deep

11:09.210 --> 11:10.757
to find the spiritual
connection to

11:10.920 --> 11:13.173
poached Dover Sole
over baby fennel.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.969
Come on, you love all her
fancy chateau de chez moi meals.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.887
The belly rules the mind.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.602
No, her mind
rules your belly.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.983
You could always join me
for takeout at the Red Lantern.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.898
You know what they say
about fast food,

11:26.060 --> 11:27.232
it's like pornography.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.397
Not much of a substitute
for the real thing,

11:29.564 --> 11:32.192
but ready and available
when you need it.

12:03.890 --> 12:04.812
Hello.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.067
(sigh)

12:07.227 --> 12:09.025
Ames, this is
a big account.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.397
It's a big fat account.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.531
Big enough to pay for
all these renovations account.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.284
Do you know how hard it is
to roast an organic partridge

12:15.443 --> 12:17.161
without the proper
convection oven?

12:28.373 --> 12:30.171
Honey, they fixed
my countertop, but--

12:30.333 --> 12:32.051
Hey, buddy.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.759
--The lighting
is all wrong.

12:34.921 --> 12:35.968
Looks great to me.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.882
Well, not when you're
standing behind the island.

12:38.049 --> 12:41.474
It needs to be
more... glamorous.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.139
Call the electrician.
No one listens to me.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.811
Did you miss me?

12:45.974 --> 12:47.726
I missed you.
That's my boy.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.196
How were the truffles?
They were parigord.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.986
The best.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.657
Did they overpower
the partridge?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.159
Definitely not.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.828
Was the partridge young enough,
tender enough?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.497
Just like you, babe.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.919
Well, maybe not
quite that tender.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.084
Are you sure I haven't
gotten too tough,

13:13.251 --> 13:15.174
too meaty?

13:15.336 --> 13:20.684
Well, it didn't seem that way to me,
last time I had a taste.

13:20.842 --> 13:24.187
It's been a few days.
Maybe you should make sure.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.142
Time to play
find the hidden spice.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.401
(chuckling)

13:40.778 --> 13:41.745
Are you focusing?

13:41.863 --> 13:43.240
Mm-hm.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.701
Sweet aroma.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.166
Solid structure.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.127
Come on, baby.
Let's go to the couch.

13:51.289 --> 13:52.381
No, no,
let's stay here.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.134
You can smell
the wild truffles.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.091
Wild truffles, huh?

14:04.177 --> 14:07.556
(moaning)

14:07.722 --> 14:08.848
You like that?

14:09.015 --> 14:12.019
(heavy breathing)

14:18.983 --> 14:21.987
(moaning)

14:39.921 --> 14:41.389
Ohh...

14:42.882 --> 14:45.135
Oh! Oh, you found it!

14:45.259 --> 14:46.556
(moaning)

14:46.719 --> 14:48.517
That's the
missing spice.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.692
-(crash)
_Qh__

14:52.850 --> 14:54.477
on, Fred! (gasps)

14:54.644 --> 14:56.112
Oh, God.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.443
Hey. What are
you doing?

14:58.606 --> 14:59.778
I gotta glue it
back together.

14:59.941 --> 15:00.783
It's my
favourite set.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.573
What about me?

15:19.752 --> 15:23.256
I just don't understand
why Saffron would leave.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.180
According to her agent,
she was up for a lot of parts,

15:26.300 --> 15:28.268
her magazine articles
were gobbled up

15:28.428 --> 15:30.851
bythousands
of women.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.981
Agents will
say anything.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.485
Another struggling
actress.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.021
A bit shy
on the leading roles.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.899
So you took an interest
in her career?

15:41.023 --> 15:43.071
(beeping)

15:43.234 --> 15:44.201
My oven.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.988
Excuse me, detective,
I have a soufflé that needs rescuing.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.083
Saffron: It wasn't my fault.

16:02.879 --> 16:06.725
I would rather
DIE IN A GUTTER

16:06.883 --> 16:08.885
than come back to
this hellhole!

16:12.972 --> 16:14.974
It wasn't my fault!

16:20.438 --> 16:24.193
I would rather
die in a gutter...

16:26.777 --> 16:29.155
than come back to
this hellhole.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.782
(mufﬂed talking)

16:42.752 --> 16:44.425
I would rather
die in a gutter

16:44.545 --> 16:46.343
than come back to
this hellhole.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.134
Okay.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.103
You take me
for granted.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.143
Half the entire staff
got laid off.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.061
It wasn't my fault.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.104
Ugh.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.768
You take me
for granted.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.484
Half the entire staff got laid off.
It wasn't my fault.

17:01.646 --> 17:02.613
It wasn't my fault.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.992
Half the entire staff
got laid off. It's not...

17:06.150 --> 17:10.576
it-- It wasn't my fault.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.707
UQhhh!

17:13.866 --> 17:14.788
Ugh.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.203
Fuck!

17:19.579 --> 17:20.797
I can't do this.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.346
I can't do it.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.340
Girl: I can't.
(Cfying)

17:30.466 --> 17:33.845
Woman: Saffron, you have
rehearsed this for weeks.

17:34.011 --> 17:37.641
Everyone is waiting on you.
Do not let them down.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.559
I am your mother, Saffie.
Listen to me--

17:39.725 --> 17:40.772
<i>No!
(Crying)</i>

17:41.060 --> 17:42.027
--Ten pounds, I know.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.987
Do you think that
this lasts forever?

17:45.523 --> 17:46.900
We are ready.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.192
We're ready.

17:48.359 --> 17:49.326
Let's go.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.737
Come on, Saffie.

17:50.861 --> 17:51.737
Smile.

17:51.862 --> 17:52.738
Not ready, Mom.
(ﬂying)

17:52.863 --> 17:54.410
Mother: Big smile.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.307
Ten minutes.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.721
Igofia
hit the road, babe.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.936
I got a big commercial appraisal
out of town.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.602
You're gonna miss me
when I land my own cooking show.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.905
Can't wait to see
my favourite chef on TV.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.366
I'll see you later.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.787
Good morning,
my fine feathered friend.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.793
Who's a good boy?

18:39.952 --> 18:40.999
I'll see ya later.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.004
(bird noises)

18:51.088 --> 18:52.681
(knocking)

18:52.840 --> 18:55.593
Hi. It's your neighbour.
I have your mail.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.432
S. Nelson, 302.
That's you, right?

19:01.599 --> 19:03.727
Yep. Thank you.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.645
Did you just move in?
We've never met.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.279
No, I'm just not
always here.

19:07.438 --> 19:08.781
- Oh.
- Thanks.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.441
My pleasure.
I'm Amy.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.451
Saffron.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.495
(whispers)
Saffron.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.707
0h, my God!
Oh, my God!

19:25.122 --> 19:26.419
Where is it?

19:54.110 --> 19:56.158
Man: Missed you
so much.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.337
I missed you too.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.298
My Saffie.

20:14.004 --> 20:17.008
(phone rings)

20:19.844 --> 20:20.595
Hi, Mom.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.763
Mother: You remember
my friend Lou Rosen?

20:22.930 --> 20:24.352
Well, he is now
the sole distributor

20:24.515 --> 20:27.064
for this new ayurvedic
antioxidant.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.227
You know,
he's a celebrity.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.863
He does TV ads
and everything,

20:30.980 --> 20:33.483
and they use this
ancient Chinese herb and it just

20:33.649 --> 20:34.901
melts away the pounds.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.490
You know, it's probably pure speed.
Why don't you just eat real food?

20:37.653 --> 20:39.121
He says it's
completely organic,

20:39.280 --> 20:40.782
very healthy,
and I'm gonna send you some.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.700
Beause you need to hang on
to that slim little

20:42.825 --> 20:45.169
figure of yours
while you still can.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.328
Really?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.372
I lost Herb when I started
putting on weight

20:48.539 --> 20:50.257
and don't want you
going through the same thing.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.214
You lost Herb because
he was a philandering jerk,

20:52.376 --> 20:54.128
you didn't know when
to give into him.

20:54.295 --> 20:55.421
Thank God
he had money.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.340
Don't listen to me
if you don't want to.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.594
But don't come complaining to me
that no one tried to tell you so

21:00.760 --> 21:02.762
when you watch Fred
walk out that door.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.100
Thanks, Mom,
for the advice.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.188
You're welcome.

21:05.306 --> 21:08.776
Fred's not going anywhere.
He's happy as a cherrystone clam.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.272
All the showroom glass
is an asset.

21:47.431 --> 21:51.061
(phone ringing)

21:51.227 --> 21:53.605
Yeah, the dead end street
could hurt the value.

21:53.771 --> 21:56.149
You've reached Fred Grant.
Leave a message.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.326
I was hopin'
to take you to Earl's.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.910
It's the home of
the mother of all burgers.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.861
Oh, my God. Saffron?
Saffron Nelson?

22:38.983 --> 22:39.734
Yes?

22:39.900 --> 22:41.652
Could you please
sign this for me?

22:41.819 --> 22:46.040
I love your movies,
but your sex column is so hot.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.849
Okay, Jennifer,
you'll be next-- Saffron!

23:11.015 --> 23:12.358
Thanks so much
for coming down.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.065
Listen, um, I don't
mean to embarrass you.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.571
I told your agent
this was a real long shot,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.482
but he hasn't been
able to reach you.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.070
I've been away.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.656
Well, I'm sorry, but we're
looking for someone more, um--

23:23.819 --> 23:26.322
Well, someone unknown.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.455
Younger.

23:27.615 --> 23:30.243
Younger might help,
but really a new face.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.956
There isn't any money
for the role.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.336
I already discussed this
with Eric.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.122
I don't care.
I love it.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.259
I--I will even read
if there's no offer on the table.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.010
I will do
whatever it takes.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.551
Okay.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.889
Someone younger, then.
Someone fresher.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.262
Fresher.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.225
Okay.

23:51.388 --> 23:52.389
Sorry.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.853
So great to see you.

23:54.016 --> 23:57.566
Jennifer, you can
come on in now.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.568
(chuckling)

24:42.731 --> 24:45.280
So the owner walks in
and finds all this imported furniture,

24:45.442 --> 24:48.446
and an entire family
had moved into his office.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.329
(laughing)

24:49.488 --> 24:50.865
(phone ringing)

24:51.031 --> 24:52.157
Oh, boy.

24:55.953 --> 24:57.000
Yes, dear?

24:57.162 --> 24:58.630
Honey, I wish
you'd return my calls.

24:58.789 --> 25:01.417
I've got devil/ed blue point
crab cakes in the oven

25:01.542 --> 25:02.759
and they just
came in fresh.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.044
You will go insane.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.555
Honey, thought I told you
I was on the road today?

25:06.714 --> 25:08.307
And pick up
two bottles of Chablis

25:08.424 --> 25:10.301
on the way home.
It's not too fruity.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.394
And try to make it by nine.
Love you.

25:12.553 --> 25:13.896
You too.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.359
Oh, you, uh,
have a little, right...

25:20.644 --> 25:21.520
There.

25:21.687 --> 25:22.609
Thanks.

25:22.771 --> 25:23.738
Welcome.

25:35.409 --> 25:37.207
Do you fully
taste the crab?

25:39.163 --> 25:40.164
Fully.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.253
'Cause most of the time
in the restaurant, you only get

25:42.416 --> 25:45.090
the canned crab
and the cornmeal.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.879
Here you go, bud.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.424
You know, he's gotta get used
to eating in his cage or

25:49.590 --> 25:51.513
we'll never have a minute
to ourself.

25:51.675 --> 25:55.646
He likes watching you cook.
Don't ya, Bas?

25:55.804 --> 25:57.101
That's my boy.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.815
Sometimes I get
the feeling my food

25:58.974 --> 26:00.817
doesn't interest you
that much.

26:00.976 --> 26:04.025
You know what?
Everything isn't always about food.

26:05.189 --> 26:05.985
Who's a good boy?

26:06.148 --> 26:08.697
Do you realize I spent all day
making that for you?

26:08.859 --> 26:10.827
Well, don't. Don't do it.
You don't have to.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.696
You could do
something simple for once.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.118
Like what,
a TV dinner?

26:14.281 --> 26:15.749
Yeah. I've had 'em.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.994
Nobody's ever died from one
as far as I know.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.628
It's never gonna happen
around here.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.964
What kind of woman
serves her family a TV dinner?

26:22.122 --> 26:23.499
Well, maybe one
that's got a life.

26:23.624 --> 26:25.422
(mocking)
"How does it taste? Is it good?

26:25.542 --> 26:27.135
"Is it too salty,
too spicy?"

26:27.294 --> 26:30.594
God, I'm sick of hearing
the same thing every single night.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.009
Is there nothing else
worth thinking about?

26:33.175 --> 26:34.768
I can't believe how much
you've changed.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.646
We've had the same conversation
for the past year.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.398
Find something to do
with your life.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.773
I am.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.903
Imagine me in front of
a live studio audience.

26:44.061 --> 26:44.857
Not this again.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.488
A million viewers.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.024
All waiting with
bated breath

26:48.190 --> 26:52.320
for me to deliver
the next greatest dish.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.699
You don't get it,
Freddo, do you?

26:56.824 --> 26:59.418
This is my life.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.833
Mmm.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.936
You barely ate earlier.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.189
There must be some room
for dessert in there.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.399
No room, all full?

27:22.558 --> 27:25.311
Come on. Open up.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.571
You know, the secret
to making a good profiterole

27:27.729 --> 27:29.481
is you have to freeze
the pastry first.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.240
Uh, baby...

27:30.399 --> 27:31.992
Start off with it
nice and firm.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.152
I've been
drivin' all day.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.410
That's why
you need sugar.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.993
Coco lifts the spirit.
It'll lift just about anything.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.373
I could have
made you anything,

27:38.532 --> 27:40.626
like a cherry tart,
but there's nothing like

27:40.742 --> 27:43.666
creamy chocolate
and vanilla together.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.422
Hot and cold.

27:45.581 --> 27:46.833
Fire and ice.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.172
Tell me
how you want me.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.427
No. Enough is enough.

27:51.587 --> 27:52.884
No more
fucking food.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.217
Jesus Christ.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.638
I'm goin' to bed.

28:01.847 --> 28:05.772
You don't have to be so blunt.
I'm a perceptive girl.

28:06.643 --> 28:09.112
(phone beeps)

28:32.502 --> 28:39.101

melt in my mouth. ♪

I need that risotto yesterday.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.748
Man 2:
Plate's up on fourteen.

29:51.540 --> 29:52.757
MED.' Amy?

29:52.916 --> 29:54.168
Amy: Hi, Lucas.

29:55.711 --> 29:59.090
Hey-- I tried to tell you.
Jefe likes it the way he likes it.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.008
Don't worry,
I don't want my job back.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.642
I'm getting
my own cooking show.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.327
What did he order?

30:23.238 --> 30:25.036
The moules frites.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.242
You know he still brings
his coworkers here.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.411
Well, I didn't realize
he fed them too.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.095
The asshole never liked them
when I made them.

30:43.383 --> 30:46.478
I try so hard
to make him happy.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.513
Seems like I can
never do enough.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.439
Man: Order's ready
for seven, Lucas!

31:01.860 --> 31:05.160
Sometimes with all these
clever gastronomic combinations,

31:05.322 --> 31:07.074
and catering to
people's desire,

31:07.240 --> 31:09.288
somebody's just
bound to get hurt.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.997
But now we do
what we do best in this show--

31:13.163 --> 31:14.756
communicate
those touchy feelings

31:14.915 --> 31:17.293
which can only truly be expressed
through cooking.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.679
(angry chopping
as audience cheers)

31:20.837 --> 31:23.932
All that pampering and posturing
and pandering

31:24.091 --> 31:25.718
just to get
a response.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.636
A tiny spark
of appreciation.

31:27.803 --> 31:30.306
And the minute a hot piece of ass
comes your way,

31:30.472 --> 31:32.850
you're all over it
like white on rice.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.017
Moules frites.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.735
Probably the only muscle
she ever had

31:35.894 --> 31:37.862
was in the back seat
of a car on her knees.

31:37.979 --> 31:38.855
Audience:
Whore!

31:38.980 --> 31:41.199
Stick to your
greasy burgers, girlfriend.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.531
But does all this mean

31:43.693 --> 31:46.913
that we have to lower
the gastronomic bar?

31:47.072 --> 31:48.824
Audience:
No!

31:48.990 --> 31:50.458
Damn straight.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.961
Because food
is an art, people,

31:53.120 --> 31:57.591
and true artists fight back
through all the pain and indifference.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.501
They never give up.

31:59.668 --> 32:00.885
Audience:
Go, girl!

32:20.564 --> 32:23.784
I thought our one-year engagement
was special enough

32:23.900 --> 32:25.618
to break out
my best silverware.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.747
I wanted everything
to be perfect.

32:29.865 --> 32:30.866
I think it looks amazing,

32:31.032 --> 32:33.501
like one of those kitchens
you see in a magazine.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.288
Not with the kitchen.
I mean with the meal.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.504
How could you go wrong?
You made my favourite. It's delicious.

32:39.666 --> 32:42.010
Actually, they ran out of
the organic partridge, which is unusual,

32:42.169 --> 32:45.173
because the delivery from Beaver Creek
Farms is on Tuesday night.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.887
So I thought, well, you know Fred.
What can we do?

32:48.049 --> 32:51.849
He won't want meat because
he probably snuck in a burger at lunch.

32:52.012 --> 32:55.767
Maybe mussels, fries.
we always enjoyed that together.

32:55.932 --> 32:59.732
You know, we've been having these
catered lunches at work, and, uh--

32:59.895 --> 33:01.943
So I checked in my cooking journal,
and I realized

33:02.063 --> 33:05.033
that on three out of the five occasions
I've made your favourite stuffed game

33:05.192 --> 33:08.867
that you haven't been able
to really enjoy it.

33:09.029 --> 33:09.905
I wasn't?

33:10.071 --> 33:12.540
No, because it has to be savoured
fresh out of the oven

33:12.699 --> 33:13.951
to fully appreciate
the aroma

33:14.117 --> 33:17.087
and the fragrance
in all of its intensity.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.121
We went over this.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.666
Do you remember?

33:20.832 --> 33:24.587
Look, Amy, if this is about
me being insensitive, I apologize.

33:24.753 --> 33:28.348
Things at work have been...
let's say challenging.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.509
Well, challenging is
when something you want

33:30.675 --> 33:32.848
makes you work harder
to get it.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.308
Is that what you mean?

33:36.473 --> 33:38.066
Where are you going
with this?

33:38.183 --> 33:40.527
Well, I thought, you know,
don't get all uptight

33:40.685 --> 33:42.107
and throw around
the four-letter words.

33:42.270 --> 33:46.650
Just let the wine decide
what's gonna pair with this...

33:46.816 --> 33:49.569
little love-bird.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.376
Where's Sebastian?

34:00.205 --> 34:01.457
Bas-man?

34:03.416 --> 34:04.338
Bastian?

34:06.211 --> 34:07.087
Where is he?

34:50.755 --> 34:52.223
(knocking)

34:56.803 --> 34:58.146
(knocking)

34:58.930 --> 34:59.726
Saffron?

34:59.889 --> 35:01.436
It's Amy.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.694
Hi.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.698
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.784
Um, I was just--I was
going to the market

35:14.946 --> 35:17.495
and I was going to make dinner
and I was thinking,

35:17.657 --> 35:19.500
maybe we could
have dinner sometime?

35:19.659 --> 35:21.627
Oh, tonight's
not a good night.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.663
I'm really behind
on a deadline.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.207
Oh, I wasn't thinking
about tonight.

35:25.373 --> 35:29.048
I'm so busy too, um...
What about next week?

35:29.210 --> 35:30.553
Not a good week for me.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.426
(clears throat)

35:33.590 --> 35:35.513
Well, I'll just
check back in with you.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.853
I--I appreciate
the dessert.

35:39.012 --> 35:39.888
Oh!

35:40.055 --> 35:41.181
Did you like
the profiteroles?

35:41.306 --> 35:43.274
Oh, yeah, they were wonderful.
Thank you.

35:43.433 --> 35:46.277
Did you like the way the hot
and the cold mixed together and--

35:46.436 --> 35:47.983
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

35:55.403 --> 35:56.996
Mmm.

36:03.953 --> 36:07.048
Mmm, don't you just love
the smell of fresh baking?

36:08.792 --> 36:11.511
I'm sorry
to keep asking, Amy,

36:11.670 --> 36:15.675
but something is bothering me
about your neighbour.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.935
You said
she was a recluse.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.313
Now, where does a recluse
come up with

36:21.471 --> 36:24.224
all that advice
aboutsex?

36:25.016 --> 36:30.773
Well, maybe she had a lover.
All you need is one.

36:30.939 --> 36:35.536
Did you, um,
ever see any of her movies?

36:35.694 --> 36:39.449
Not that I recall. I don't really follow
who's who, except in the kitchens.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.291
Go ahead. Try it.

36:45.578 --> 36:48.377
You know, I'm really just
a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.792
Oh, a bite
won't kill you.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.710
I'd love to,
but I have this, uh,

36:51.876 --> 36:55.597
bad flap, that if I eat
something like this, I get...

36:55.755 --> 36:56.677
(clicking)

36:56.840 --> 36:59.013
I--I even take
a pill for it.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.519
(sighs)

37:03.221 --> 37:04.894
l-lnfi-

37:06.266 --> 37:08.360
Mmm.

37:08.518 --> 37:09.314
You know,

37:09.477 --> 37:11.855
they sell you the vanilla extract
and it's not pure.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.108
That is unfair.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.111
What about you?
Anyone in your life?

37:20.113 --> 37:22.582
No. No one.

37:22.741 --> 37:27.713
Well, someone is
definitely missing out.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.295
I got rid of
the last one.

37:34.461 --> 37:35.838
I'm free as a bird.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.096
(chOP)

37:45.221 --> 37:47.315
Sometimes
you get so far gone

37:47.474 --> 37:49.647
that you can't see
what's good for you anymore.

37:49.809 --> 37:52.028
And when a new opportunity
presents itself,

37:52.187 --> 37:53.689
you have to go for it.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.323
Audience:
(cheers)

37:55.482 --> 37:58.406
Mmm-- now, fish en croute
with lemon butter sauce

37:58.568 --> 38:00.991
isn't as intimidating
as it sounds.

38:01.154 --> 38:03.373
A dish like this
speaks volumes.

38:03.531 --> 38:07.911
It says, 'I've made this for you
with affection'.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.131
(knocking)

38:30.266 --> 38:35.614
May I suggest fish en croute
with lemon butter sauce?

38:38.399 --> 38:43.326
I just renovated my kitchen,
so it's kind of a celebration.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.867
Thank you for thinking of me,
but I've already eaten dinner.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.785
Well, then, keep it
and eat it later.

38:48.952 --> 38:52.206
No, no, I really--
I--I--I couldn't.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.965
I know you think
I'm pushy, but

38:54.123 --> 38:56.842
you can't afford to be shy
when it comes to food.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.631
Do you live
by yourself?

39:01.798 --> 39:02.765
Yep.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.727
You know, I wasn't sure at first
that it was you.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.637
But then there was
something, I don't know.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.351
Made me think
about being a kid.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.892
Yeah... Kids shows
were fun back then.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.311
Too bad the asshole producers
took all the fun away.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.900
I used to watch your show
every night after dinner.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.570
It was like you were
a part of the family.

39:24.529 --> 39:27.157
That's wonderful,
Amy, but I--

39:27.323 --> 39:29.371
I have work I--I need
to get back to.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.208
Oh! Um, en croute
means in a crust.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.168
It's a ﬂounder
in a puff pastry.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.332
Actually, I know
what 'en croute' means.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.217
Oh, of course.
You're so sophisticated.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.925
I hope you approve.
I made it specially for you.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.089
You're so skinny.
I need to lose some weight.

39:43.256 --> 39:46.305
I should be, like,
ten pounds lighter for my height.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.970
And you're still
so pretty, Saffron.

39:49.137 --> 39:52.357
L--I'm flattered. But, sadly,
I've already eaten.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.062
It would really
make my day

39:54.183 --> 39:56.936
if you would just try it right now
while the lemon cream

39:57.061 --> 40:00.941
is still hot and tangy enough
to really do its job.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.286
Come on. I dropped a bomb
on the stove.

40:05.445 --> 40:06.947
Need to know
if it's worth the money.

40:07.113 --> 40:09.616
Of course, it was
the idiot's money, but...

40:12.076 --> 40:13.498
Mmm.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.539
It's delicious.

40:16.664 --> 40:17.631
- Really?
- M m-hm.

40:17.790 --> 40:18.962
You really think so?

40:19.125 --> 40:22.129
Mmm. I really--I need
to get back to my work.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.640
I'm so happy we're neighbours.
You have no idea.

40:25.798 --> 40:27.220
Let me know
how the cream works.

40:27.342 --> 40:30.221
Don't let it sit too long
'cause it'll lose all of its flavour.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.892
Bye.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.968
Audience:
(cheers) Amy!

41:44.127 --> 41:46.425
Welcome back
to Food For Love,

41:46.587 --> 41:51.809
where we transform dinner
into a romantic love affair.

41:51.968 --> 41:54.221
Now, with rack of lamb
with truffled ragout,

41:54.387 --> 41:57.482
you're gonna want to have
your butcher french the bones.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.233
Unless you're handy
with a meat cleaver,

41:59.392 --> 42:01.815
which I personally
am not.

42:02.186 --> 42:06.942
I've always been partial to
the black truffle oil of France.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.486
Now, truffles
are libido enhancers

42:09.652 --> 42:11.950
because they're rich in...

42:12.113 --> 42:13.490
Audience:
Amino acids!

42:13.656 --> 42:14.782
Audience:
(Clapping)

42:14.949 --> 42:18.624
This dish is really
all about meat.

42:18.745 --> 42:20.918
Fred used to say,
"I didn't fight my way

42:21.080 --> 42:24.209
"to the top of the food chain
to be a vegetarian."

42:24.375 --> 42:26.753
Who says those vegetarians
don't let their

42:26.919 --> 42:28.762
inner animal out
in the bedroom?

42:28.921 --> 42:30.969
Audience:
(cheering)

42:38.389 --> 42:39.686
(knocking)

42:40.516 --> 42:43.144
It's 301. I have
a surprise for you.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.359
Oh, my God.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.118
I hope I'm not
bothering you.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.075
Actually, I'm in
the middle of writing.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.874
How do you
cook in here?

43:04.373 --> 43:06.341
(clears throat)

43:12.924 --> 43:14.141
You were amazing
in that.

43:14.300 --> 43:17.019
You fought it out with a broken leg
for half the movie.

43:17.178 --> 43:19.522
And I actually broke my leg
making the movie.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.274
Wow. I hope
they paid you a lot.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.650
You'd have to
ask my mother.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.437
She took care
of all that.

43:31.692 --> 43:33.160
Is... that for me?

43:33.319 --> 43:35.492
It's rack of lamb
with truffled ragout.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.623
I made it special
for you.

43:40.993 --> 43:43.746
That is very kind of you.

43:43.913 --> 43:45.665
I'm--I'm just
not hungry.

43:45.832 --> 43:46.583
I figured that.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.673
But did you know that protein
is essential for a strong libido?

43:49.836 --> 43:52.555
A study showed that women
who don't eat enough red meat

43:52.713 --> 43:55.307
have weaker orgasms.

43:57.176 --> 43:58.268
I don't eat meat.

43:58.427 --> 44:00.179
I can tell that
by looking at you,

44:00.346 --> 44:02.940
but you haven't
tried my meat dishes.

44:03.516 --> 44:04.984
(whispers)
My lighter.

44:05.101 --> 44:08.480
-(phone ringing)
-(beep)

44:08.646 --> 44:10.694
Hey, it's Eric.
Listen, they saw your reel.

44:10.857 --> 44:11.608
They're gonna pass.

44:11.774 --> 44:13.242
Unless you wanna
audition for the mother.

44:13.401 --> 44:14.402
I'll speak to you later.

44:14.569 --> 44:15.570
Assholes.

44:21.117 --> 44:22.664
My kind of girl.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.838
I love your column.

44:25.997 --> 44:29.752
I try to make women feel
young and powerful.

44:29.917 --> 44:31.590
We don't often
feel that way.

44:32.587 --> 44:33.804
For someone
who writes about sex,

44:33.963 --> 44:35.590
I'm surprised
you don't eat meat.

44:35.756 --> 44:36.803
Really?

44:36.966 --> 44:38.639
Half of India
is vegetarian,

44:38.801 --> 44:40.394
and they don't have
a problem reproducing.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.681
But do they enjoy
the sex?

44:44.515 --> 44:45.858
Fred loved meat.

44:46.017 --> 44:47.940
More than he loved me
apparently.

44:48.186 --> 44:51.781
Oh, it's like this lamb
was born in this sauce.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.318
Mmm, just try it.

44:56.444 --> 44:59.573
Uh... Excuse me.

45:09.415 --> 45:11.759
You have to eat
or you're gonna die.

45:11.918 --> 45:14.967
(water running)

45:15.129 --> 45:18.099
(vomiting)

45:18.257 --> 45:21.261
(water running)

45:29.518 --> 45:30.644
(echo) Saffron, you just...

45:30.811 --> 45:31.607
(_eCho)
Just“,

45:31.771 --> 45:33.944
(echo) you try to
sneak one of these in?

45:34.065 --> 45:35.282
(echo). . . these in?
...one of these in?

45:35.441 --> 45:36.988
Saffie, you just
get your weight down

45:37.151 --> 45:38.903
and you try to sneak
one of these in?

45:39.070 --> 45:40.868
You know, you have to
watch what you eat.

45:41.030 --> 45:42.532
- No thanks.
- Saffie, try it.

45:42.698 --> 45:46.748
You have any idea what I have
sacrificed for your career?

45:46.911 --> 45:47.958
I love you.

45:53.292 --> 45:55.590
Jack! How's it going?

45:56.337 --> 45:57.384
- Sharon.
- Bob.

45:57.546 --> 46:00.049
So this is little
Lady Saffron, huh?

46:02.009 --> 46:03.556
You're even prettier
than your head shot.

46:04.845 --> 46:05.812
No...no.

46:05.972 --> 46:07.019
Too bad.

46:07.139 --> 46:08.391
They make you so hot.

46:08.557 --> 46:10.025
(chuckles)

46:10.142 --> 46:11.689
Mmm.

46:12.019 --> 46:14.522
Jack's right over there, babe.
He's a piggybank.

46:14.689 --> 46:16.566
Why don't you
go shake his tree?

46:16.732 --> 46:19.451
Why don't we talk
about you, angel-face?

46:19.610 --> 46:21.408
(echo)
angel-face, angel-face...

46:37.670 --> 46:38.842
Amy's mother:
How's Fred?

46:39.005 --> 46:40.632
As far as I remember,
no man's ever lasted

46:40.798 --> 46:42.015
more than six months
with you.

46:42.174 --> 46:44.222
Do we have
a new record?

46:44.343 --> 46:45.560
Fred's infatuated
with me.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.438
There's no other woman
he'd shed blood for.

46:47.596 --> 46:50.099
Oh, that's wonderful, sweetheart.
So do you have a job?

46:50.224 --> 46:52.443
I'm preparing
my own cooking show.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.649
You'll never guess
who my new neighbour is.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.405
She lives
right in my building.

46:56.564 --> 46:58.908
Do you remember
Saffron Nelson,

46:59.025 --> 47:01.244
'Season of Love',
'Silent Laughter'?

47:01.402 --> 47:04.076
'Twilight Pearl'!
She was so beautiful.

47:04.238 --> 47:06.161
Oh, you must have watched
every single show.

47:06.324 --> 47:07.120
Did you introduce
yourself?

47:07.283 --> 47:09.502
Introduce myself?
I am making her dinner!

47:09.660 --> 47:11.037
So, can I meet her?

47:11.203 --> 47:12.750
You know how it is
with celebrities.

47:12.913 --> 47:13.835
They're very private.

47:13.998 --> 47:17.218
You have to be respectful,
feel out the situation.

48:55.850 --> 48:57.852
(giggling)

48:58.018 --> 48:59.691
Mmm.

49:02.064 --> 49:05.409
(giggling)

49:05.568 --> 49:07.411
I've got it.

49:07.570 --> 49:10.039
A bouillabaisse.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.828
Today's mystery
ingredient says:

49:15.995 --> 49:19.124
"I'm an introvert
who handles stress poorly.

49:19.290 --> 49:21.713
"Eat me so you can
get laid real fast."

49:21.876 --> 49:22.672
What am I?

49:22.835 --> 49:24.052
Audience:
An oyster!

49:24.753 --> 49:26.300
Very good.

49:26.422 --> 49:30.552
A real student of both the kitchen
and the bedroom.

49:30.718 --> 49:33.062
Oysters and sex
have something in common.

49:33.220 --> 49:35.518
They're both...
that good

49:35.681 --> 49:38.560
that you close an eye
to the mess that they make.

49:43.772 --> 49:45.194
(gasp)

49:47.443 --> 49:48.865
(knocking)

49:51.530 --> 49:53.373
It's open.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.873
I know you're busy.
I'm just checking in.

49:57.036 --> 49:58.504
I know what it
must be like

49:58.621 --> 50:00.999
with the reading,
the auditions, the pressure.

50:02.708 --> 50:05.257
The hardest thing is not
having someone to talk to.

50:05.419 --> 50:07.171
To really talk to.

50:12.384 --> 50:14.557
Did he leave you?

50:14.720 --> 50:15.937
I left him.

50:17.264 --> 50:18.686
How can someone
be so needy

50:18.849 --> 50:21.272
and yet so unresponsive
to someone else's needs?

50:21.435 --> 50:23.062
It's not hard,
trust me.

50:25.981 --> 50:28.109
It's so hard
being alone.

50:28.275 --> 50:29.868
You're one of
the lucky ones. You--

50:29.985 --> 50:32.829
chose what you wanted to do
and it worked out.

50:32.988 --> 50:35.867
Oh, yeah, they're just knocking
my door down trying to hire me.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.376
Haven't you
seen 'em all?

50:39.995 --> 50:44.250
Will you let me know
how the bouillabaisse is?

50:44.416 --> 50:45.383
I know you
love oysters.

50:45.501 --> 50:46.548
I made this for you

50:46.710 --> 50:49.304
inspired by your scene
from 'Twilight Pearl'.

50:49.421 --> 50:50.843
You were
unforgettable.

50:52.466 --> 50:55.595
I didn't actually
eat an oyster.

50:55.761 --> 50:56.478
You didn't?

50:56.637 --> 50:58.139
No.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.488
Please just try it.

51:11.110 --> 51:12.453
Mmm-hm-hm.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.414
I'll just
leave it here.

51:26.667 --> 51:28.886
(gagging, spitting)

51:54.403 --> 51:57.156
Don't make me go back
to my cookbook, Saffie.

52:01.994 --> 52:02.870
(knocking)

52:03.037 --> 52:04.084
Gonna get cold.

52:09.668 --> 52:10.590
(knocking)

52:10.753 --> 52:12.380
You don't know
what you're missing.

52:18.469 --> 52:19.265
(knocking)

52:19.428 --> 52:20.429
I 'll just
leave it here.

52:26.810 --> 52:27.777
(knocking)

52:27.936 --> 52:29.938
Come on!
I know you're in there.

52:58.467 --> 52:59.889
(elevator dings)

53:03.972 --> 53:04.973
I'm sorry.

53:07.142 --> 53:08.234
For what?

53:10.979 --> 53:12.105
Let me see that.

53:19.113 --> 53:20.706
This is
the appreciation I get?

53:21.031 --> 53:22.408
I'm very, very sorry.

53:22.574 --> 53:24.576
I just...
I couldn't eat it all.

53:25.035 --> 53:26.787
- We'll see about that!
- Ah, no!

53:26.954 --> 53:27.796
Get in there!

53:27.955 --> 53:29.423
Ahh!

53:30.791 --> 53:32.384
Sit down.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.006
(Crash)

53:34.169 --> 53:35.967
(crying)

53:36.130 --> 53:37.382
Please, please...

53:37.506 --> 53:39.133
Please! Please what?

53:39.299 --> 53:41.677
I made this for you!
Now, EAT!

53:41.844 --> 53:42.561
I can't.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.563
Yes, you can.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.144
You're not gonna
reject me too.

53:46.932 --> 53:48.855
Who are you
to despise my food?

53:49.017 --> 53:51.566
My entire body
rejects it.

53:51.770 --> 53:57.402
You fucking snob!
This is my creation. MINE!

53:58.485 --> 53:59.077
Eat!

53:59.236 --> 54:00.237
You will eat.

54:01.363 --> 54:03.912
(screams)

54:06.660 --> 54:08.628
ARGH!

54:15.294 --> 54:16.967
I'll show you
rejection.

54:19.465 --> 54:20.887
You wanna be
close to me?

54:21.049 --> 54:22.926
Well, now you're close.

54:23.093 --> 54:24.345
Ringside seat.

54:25.512 --> 54:30.188
Normally I'd run the water
so no one would hear, but,

54:30.350 --> 54:31.818
we don't have
to worry.

54:31.977 --> 54:34.446
It's just you
and me.

54:34.605 --> 54:36.607
And we're friends
now, right?

54:39.526 --> 54:41.403
Then I do it.

54:41.570 --> 54:44.665
In and out,
back and forth.

54:44.782 --> 54:46.500
It's as natural
as sex.

54:47.910 --> 54:50.914
(gagging, vomiting)

54:54.875 --> 54:57.549
I used to wrap
my knuckles.

54:57.711 --> 54:58.382
(laughs)

54:58.504 --> 55:01.303
Then I would choke
on the fucking toilet paper.

55:01.423 --> 55:02.800
Once I even used
a plastic spoon

55:02.966 --> 55:06.470
when I was so afraid
it would go down. Mm-hm.

55:07.429 --> 55:09.682
(vomiting)

55:19.900 --> 55:21.527
Am I beautiful now?

55:25.531 --> 55:28.535
It's not your food, Amy.
It's not the taste.

55:30.744 --> 55:32.621
What is it?

55:33.372 --> 55:36.376
It's a vice that's stuck around,
and it's not welcome.

55:39.044 --> 55:42.344
You have to eat something,
Saffie, or... you'll die.

55:43.131 --> 55:46.010
How do you feed something
that can't be fed?

55:49.388 --> 55:51.607
I just want it
to disappear.

56:04.236 --> 56:05.328
You're really beautiful.

56:17.583 --> 56:19.460
I wanted to get out so bad.

56:20.544 --> 56:22.342
Then when I was
really ready to bail,

56:22.462 --> 56:25.306
I saw what I was
up against.

56:26.300 --> 56:27.927
They all needed me.

56:28.093 --> 56:30.642
They all fed off me.

56:30.804 --> 56:32.556
Even my own father.

56:34.141 --> 56:36.815
I supported him
for, like, twenty years.

56:36.977 --> 56:39.605
If it wasn't for me,
he'd probably be in prison.

56:39.938 --> 56:41.736
I'm sorry.

56:42.357 --> 56:45.076
I thought my father
was a deadbeat.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.957
Saffie, what can I do?

56:51.116 --> 56:55.371
Be someone who doesn't
want anything from me.

56:56.705 --> 56:58.048
Can you do that?

57:02.628 --> 57:04.972
I really need
to be alone, please.

57:06.590 --> 57:08.388
Please give me
another chance.

57:08.550 --> 57:10.302
To cook for you.

57:10.469 --> 57:12.892
To make you
feel whole.

57:13.347 --> 57:15.770
You-you can't
see it, can you?

57:15.933 --> 57:17.685
See what?

57:17.851 --> 57:19.023
The line.

57:19.144 --> 57:21.112
When to quit.

57:23.857 --> 57:25.700
Just let me make you
something simple.

57:28.403 --> 57:29.495
A soup.

58:20.455 --> 58:22.549
(knocking)

58:22.666 --> 58:24.088
It's open.

58:30.799 --> 58:32.676
You look lovely.

58:35.804 --> 58:37.477
I didn't think
you'd come.

58:38.515 --> 58:40.483
You can run lines with me
for my audition.

58:40.642 --> 58:41.985
I would love that.

58:42.102 --> 58:43.228
Have a seat.

59:10.005 --> 59:12.178
I made you
a ginger coriander broth.

59:48.960 --> 59:49.802
Is it alright?

59:49.961 --> 59:50.962
Mm-hm.

59:53.340 --> 59:56.093
The ginger root
will relax your stomach.

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:01.856
Mmm.

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:04.105
Is--is it too spicy?

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.860
I was careful
with the ginger root.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:09.774
No, no, it's, um--
Guess I have a lot on my mind.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.203
Ahh! That was good.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.579
You didn't eat
very much.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:18.991
I--I baked you
a goat cheese and tomato tart.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:21.785
No, just... Just sit.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:23.920
Do you mind
if I--if I smoke?

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:25.205
Oh, of course. Uh...

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:27.170
I'm done too.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:29.842
Oh--

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:33.759
Ashtray.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:39.678
Let's, um...
Let's run these lines, yeah?

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:40.721
Oh--

01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:43.231
Um-- Okay, you are...

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.484
You're Nicole, okay?

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:46.518
Okay.

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.358
And, um, don't feel like
you have to act.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.898
Just--
Here, just read it.

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:52.239
Okay?

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.820
You said to go with
our instincts, right?

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:58.580
Get in touch with
our animal side.

01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:00.866
If I were an animal,
which animal would I be?

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:02.909
I don't know.
Maybe a horse?

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:06.831
Come on, Dr Mann,
you know me better than that.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:08.999
A boa constrictor.

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:10.167
Not bad
but too physical.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.427
Too much effort spent
and not enough strategy.

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:13.796
A scorpion.

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:14.713
Too obvious.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.805
Stings its mate, a no-brainer
for the arachnoid vice squad.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:20.139
A net thrower.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.512
What's that?

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.931
A spider that throws a net
on its prey,

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:26.725
stings it
and sucks it dry.

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:30.737
Glad to see this game
amuses you, Nicole.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.784
Why don't you come up
to my ranch this weekend?

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:37.494
You'd love
the mountains.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:40.906
No, I--I couldn't.
Doctor-patient...

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:43.040
Confidentiality, I know.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.170
It's funny, I feel like
I've known you forever.

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:48.334
It happens.

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:51.591
But if it gets in the way of the work,
it can be dangerous.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:52.546
That was terrible.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.006
No, you were great.

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.921
Um, should we try it
one more time?

01:01:56.087 --> 01:01:57.339
Yeah. Mm-hm.

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.933
You said go with our instincts, right?
Get in touch with our animal side.

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.014
A net thrower.

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:05.268
Can you believe this dialogue?
Okay, a boa constrictor.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:06.477
I'm Saffron.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.141
You're good.

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:07.899
(laughing)

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.856
Ready? I'm going to be
very demure instead.

01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:11.270
- Demure?
- You ready for me?

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:13.359
Okay.
And action.

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:16.237
You said to go with
our instincts, right?

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.322
If I were an animal,
which animal would I be?

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:19.452
A horse.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:20.407
A horsie.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:21.162
Wow.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.368
Who talks like this?

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.123
Who actually
talks like this?

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:25.955
It's a spider
that throws a net!

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:29.212
(laughing)

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.715
Why don't you come up
to my ranch this weekend?

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:32.874
You'd love
the mountains.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:36.386
No, I can't.
Doctor-patient...

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.471
Confidentiality.
I know.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:41.509
It's funny. I feel like
I've known you forever.

01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:44.394
It happens. But if it gets
in the way of the work,

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.930
it can be very,
very dangerous.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.067
Amazing. Whoa, I just
got distracted, it was so good.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:52.026
Uhhhhh...
Let it be--

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:54.237
You know what?
I'm absolutely hideous.

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:55.648
- No!
- I am.

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:58.784
That was--oh,
that was great.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.743
But I'm impressed with
everything you do.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:02.658
(laughs)
Thank you.

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:14.173
I think you're gonna
get this job, Saffie. I can feel it.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:15.754
No.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:20.718
Not when they have every
head cheerleader Texas ever produced.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:23.300
That's who they
really deserve.

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:25.553
Not according to your agent.
He says they want you.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.813
Y-O-U, right?

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:32.643
I, um-- I need to rest.
But thank you. Um--

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.106
(clears throat)

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:36.730
I can run lines
with you tomorrow--

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:39.024
I can even go with you
if you want.

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.952
Okay. Okay.

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:44.829
Oh, wait!
Um, hah.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:47.912
I was on YouTube,
and I have something for you.

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:52.087
I thought
you might enjoy this.

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:53.588
(whispers)
Okay.

01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:10.101
Girl: I'm Saffron Nelson.

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:11.939
I'm nine years old
and I'm with EZ Talent.

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:15.102
Man: Okay, hon, you can do anything
you want. What are you gonna do for us?

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:17.396
I'm gonna do an old classic.
Is that alright?

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:18.609
Uh-huh.

Just like they always did.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.957
Just be yourself.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.087
(laughs)
Trust me.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:20.547
The real me would never please
any of these people.

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:25.429
Good luck.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.147
I knew we'd find something for you.
You're perfect for this.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:41.983
Come on in!

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:43.027
Thank you.

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.568
(clears throat)

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:51.785
Okay.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.666
Okay, any time
you're ready, Saffron.

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:56.873
Hello. My name
is Saffron Nelson.

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:58.413
I'm with
Talent Unlimited,

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.003
and I will be reading
for Dr Mann.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.464
Hi, Saffron.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:09.516
I'm sorry, um--
The light's very bright. I can't see.

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:12.723
The unforgettable
Saffron Nelson.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.273
You're still
lookin' good, Saffie.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:25.024
And I'm...
still lookin' out for you.

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:28.576
It's okay to be a little
nervous... (echoing)

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:29.782
(echo)
Be so breathtaking...

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:32.531
How does it feel
to be so breathtaking?

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:34.495
Don't worry.

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.409
Your mother trusts me.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:38.249
That's why
she's given you to me.

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:41.085
Because it's what Bob
expects from you... (echoing)

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:44.421
You are gonna be a star, Saffron.
A star. I know it.

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:46.169
(echoing) Because
you're a movie star now...

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:47.929
Because you're
a movie star, that's why.

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:49.930
(struggling)

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:54.894
I said quality.

01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:56.930
I'm gonna be looking
for someone eighteen.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:57.847
Excuse me.

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:15.331
Woman: Saffron?

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.201
Are you okay?

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:25.132
Uh-uh.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.059
- Saffie, what happened?
-(<=ryir19)

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:44.606
Saffie?

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:53.820
Saffron?

01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.459
Saffie?

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:32.822
Everything I did
was for you, Saffie.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.240
You can't tell me
it wasn't a good ride.

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:39.742
(burning sizzle)

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:13.567
(phone ringing)

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:23.042
Saffron?

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:26.754
Saffron?

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.629
(whispers)
Saffron!

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:35.212
Saffron! Are you okay?

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.303
Ooh, I fell asleep.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:41.393
It was so sweet.

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:54.441
Do you put this much effort
into everyone?

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:56.234
Or am I special?

01:09:58.152 --> 01:09:59.449
You're special.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:04.000
But I just don't know
how to give you anything.

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:06.957
There's only one thing
you can do.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.128
You're perfect for it.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.130
Aren't you?

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.343
I'll love you forever.

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.184
And you'll have me
forever.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.078
Mmm.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.708
Lie down with me.

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:54.375
You okay?

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:57.838
I feel better now.

01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:10.145
How does that feel?

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:12.902
Feels wonderful.

01:11:24.071 --> 01:11:25.698
Kiss me.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:49.139
(moaning)

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:51.732
So nice.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:56.479
You so feel good.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:58.489
- I want you to let go.
- Mm-hm.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:11:59.991
Do you wanna
do that?

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.150
I do.

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:03.031
Wonderful.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:07.407
(breathing heavily,
moaning)

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:16.290
That's it.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:18.254
Ohh!

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:18.963
Yeah.

01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:20.093
Ohh.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.218
Yes.

01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:25.099
You taste so good.

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:30.521
(moaning)

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.198
Can you feel me?

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.361
Oh!

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:46.620
I can feel you.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.994
Right there. Ohh!

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.835
(moaning)

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:03.592
Mm.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.763
Do you wanna
help me?

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:14.061
Mmm.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:16.646
I want to.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:18.356
More than anything.

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:26.869
I'd do anything
for you.

01:13:32.617 --> 01:13:34.665
Do you love me?

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.588
I love you.

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:49.054
Help me
do something...

01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:56.815
For you.

01:13:58.059 --> 01:13:59.686
To remember me.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.240
I've always
loved you, Saffie.

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:22.750
Thank you.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.053
Thank you.

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:36.689
Reynolds: Would you say
she was depressed about her work?

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.483
Did you hear
what I said?

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:42.020
(sigh) Well, who isn't
these days?

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:45.193
Yeah, but what makes someone
check out just like that-- (snap)

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:46.983
If indeed
that's what she did.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.072
She was definitely
temperamental.

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:51.203
Well, she was an actor.
What do you expect?

01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:53.035
I have a surprise
for you.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.074
You being
a meat-and-potatoes guy.

01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:58.829
So don't even think about
insulting the chef

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:01.623
by letting my last portion
go to waste.

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:07.754
You won't soon
forget this.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.799
It's the best dish
I've ever made.

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:30.242
Now, that is
real gourmet.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.863
But, you know,
it's funny.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.408
When I was doing
a background check,

01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:39.794
I found that there was no mention
of your cooking show.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.920
Well, you have to
hang on to your privacy.

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:44.127
I saw what that stuff
did to Saffron.

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:45.837
Nothing's private
these days, Amy.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.673
The show
will be on soon.

01:15:47.835 --> 01:15:49.508
The network likes to
keep it under wraps.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:52.386
And how about this?

01:15:53.674 --> 01:15:57.679
Do you, uh,
recognize that?

01:15:58.345 --> 01:16:00.723
Well, I'm not
a bird expert.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:03.734
Your ex-fiancé's
pet African Grey.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.065
I saw the police report.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:08.231
There's a very disturbing
allegation.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:12.568
Now, did you think
we wouldn't interview him?

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:16.456
That bird just didn't
fly away, did it?

01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:19.959
He's upset because
he put this place in my name.

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:22.370
But who could
invent that?

01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:24.288
Invent what?

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:27.208
That you fed it to him.

01:16:27.374 --> 01:16:30.093
That bird flew away,
like Saffron.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.755
I don't see what this has to do
with my missing neighbour.

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:39.387
At this point, I don't know,
but I plan on finding out.

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:42.147
People just
don't disappear.

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:43.979
Well, I have
nothing to hide.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.317
Get a search warrant.

01:16:57.029 --> 01:17:00.249
(heavy pulsating sound)

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:12.053
(garburator grinding)

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.969
(heavy pulsating sound)

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.313
I'd offer you dessert,
but I know you have the...

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:34.401
I have other things
besides soufﬂé.

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:37.491
(heavy pulsating sound)

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:54.299
Amy: Cooking is supposed to
make you feel loved.

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:58.007
'Cause when
you've got love,

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.051
you've got
the whole universe.
