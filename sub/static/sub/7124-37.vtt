00:32.314 --> 00:34.744
These anti-fog goggles
work a treat.

00:35.181 --> 00:37.337
Yeah, but now they stink
of dog breath.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.728
Guess what, though?
When we get to the water park,

00:40.796 --> 00:42.595
I'm gonna be ready
in super-quick time,

00:42.663 --> 00:45.298
because look... I'm already
wearing my swim trunks!

00:45.372 --> 00:48.103
I knew there was something
different about you today.

00:48.509 --> 00:49.601
Oh, wait.

00:49.669 --> 00:51.382
Did you remember to pack
your usual shorts

00:51.450 --> 00:53.050
and underwear for getting
changed into

00:53.118 --> 00:54.462
after the water park?

00:55.484 --> 00:56.780
Carry on without me.

00:56.874 --> 00:58.874
I'll take a shortcut
through the toadstool fields

00:58.942 --> 00:59.975
and get there before you!

01:00.043 --> 01:01.116
Heh, heh.

01:01.184 --> 01:03.038
I may have stinky dog breath,

01:03.157 --> 01:05.874
but at least I don't have to
concern myself with underwear.

01:12.286 --> 01:14.101
♪ At first I had no underwear ♪

01:14.169 --> 01:16.288
♪ but this time,
I brought underwear ♪

01:16.356 --> 01:18.382
♪ I'm glad I remembered
my underweaaaar! ♪

01:18.450 --> 01:19.460
Oof!

01:19.528 --> 01:21.202
Because I feel creepy
without it!

01:21.270 --> 01:22.340
Eee!

01:22.408 --> 01:24.864
Well done for remembering
your underwear, Finn.

01:25.820 --> 01:26.942
It's a long story.

01:27.010 --> 01:28.965
You see, I forgot to bring
shorts and underwear

01:29.033 --> 01:30.167
for after the water park,

01:30.235 --> 01:31.635
but then I went home
and I got some.

01:31.872 --> 01:33.051
Oh, that's where I'm going.

01:33.119 --> 01:35.098
I take swimming lessons
at the water park.

01:35.255 --> 01:37.450
Where's Jake? He's probably
nearly there by now.

01:37.518 --> 01:39.098
Aww, don't cry.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.874
He'll be fine on his own
till we get there.

01:40.942 --> 01:42.817
It's not me. Look!

01:44.474 --> 01:47.020
Princess orangutan,
what's wrong?

01:47.088 --> 01:49.255
Well, I'd been playing
all morning

01:49.332 --> 01:51.349
when I noticed this puddle.

01:51.451 --> 01:54.270
I only wanted to rest
and cool my legs down.

01:54.338 --> 01:56.364
But when I brought them back out
of the water,

01:56.559 --> 01:59.395
they were covered
in daddy-sad-heads!

02:00.009 --> 02:01.297
Yuck!

02:01.406 --> 02:03.885
Can't you just spin your legs
around and send them all flying?

02:03.953 --> 02:06.182
I can't. I'm too sad.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.354
Daddy-sad-heads
secrete a tear toxin

02:08.422 --> 02:10.418
that makes the host too sad
to get rid of them,

02:10.515 --> 02:12.754
even though all it would take
is a good shake.

02:12.788 --> 02:14.222
Don't worry, princess!

02:14.256 --> 02:16.424
I've got the perfect tool
for the job.

02:16.492 --> 02:17.992
And I'm already
in my swim trunks.

02:18.060 --> 02:19.854
No, wait!
Don't go in the water!

02:19.960 --> 02:21.692
Ooh!

02:23.653 --> 02:24.966
Why am I crying?

02:25.075 --> 02:27.445
I just told you,
it's a tear toxin.

02:27.513 --> 02:28.958
Were you not listening?

02:29.286 --> 02:30.520
I was half-listening.

02:30.751 --> 02:31.792
Did you hear the part

02:31.860 --> 02:34.341
about how they just need
a good shake to get rid of?

02:34.410 --> 02:36.277
Yeah, but I don't want
to shake them.

02:36.345 --> 02:37.558
What if I hurt them?

02:37.826 --> 02:40.441
Maybe they'll just have
to stay on forever.

02:43.643 --> 02:45.681
Ugh!
This is miserable.

02:45.788 --> 02:48.439
I know.
I use visualization techniques

02:48.525 --> 02:50.392
with my swimming students
all the time.

02:50.469 --> 02:52.275
But I already
know how to swim.

02:52.359 --> 02:54.691
I know,
but what if you visualize

02:54.759 --> 02:58.017
the daddy-sad-heads as little
jingling bells or something?

02:58.166 --> 03:00.814
And if you ring them,
it'll cheer everybody up.

03:00.882 --> 03:03.272
I don't see how a jingling bell
would cheer anybody up,

03:03.340 --> 03:04.785
but I'll give it a try.

03:04.853 --> 03:06.051
Jingle, jingle.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.199
Jingle, jingle.

03:07.276 --> 03:09.457
Nope, it didn't work.
Next plan?

03:09.525 --> 03:11.270
Okay,
let's do this properly.

03:11.347 --> 03:14.384
Shut your eyes and...
Keep that thing away from me!

03:14.452 --> 03:16.477
Okay.
When you open your eyes,

03:16.565 --> 03:18.509
you're going to be
the court jester

03:18.577 --> 03:21.025
in the court
of king daddy-sad-head,

03:21.198 --> 03:23.330
and he's really sad.

03:24.827 --> 03:28.153
So he needs you to do a dance
in your funny jingle suit

03:28.230 --> 03:29.738
to cheer him up, okay?

03:29.806 --> 03:31.541
Um, okay.

03:33.048 --> 03:35.423
Mm.
I think it's working!

03:36.304 --> 03:38.463
That's great, Finn.
Keep it up!

03:39.283 --> 03:41.960
Come with me, your majesty. Hup!
Hey, where are you...

03:42.028 --> 03:45.044
How do you like your new
jingling jester chair?

03:49.060 --> 03:50.333
Ooh!

03:51.646 --> 03:53.755
That visualization technique
worked a treat!

03:53.832 --> 03:55.323
Glad I could be
of service.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.497
Finn, as a token
of my gratitude,

03:57.591 --> 03:59.018
please accept this reward.

03:59.087 --> 04:01.621
It's a magic coin that can
turn into any value

04:01.706 --> 04:03.073
of any currency you want.

04:03.141 --> 04:04.159
Oh, cool!

04:04.227 --> 04:06.067
Will it work in the lockers
at the water park?

04:06.135 --> 04:07.777
Well, yeah,
I suppose so, but...

04:07.845 --> 04:09.185
Nice one.
Chuck it over.

04:09.253 --> 04:10.262
Whoops!

04:10.339 --> 04:12.014
Oh, wait.
Jake's been waiting for ages.

04:12.082 --> 04:13.683
What if he gives up on me
and goes home?

04:13.753 --> 04:16.519
Well, I can give you a lift
if you're not afraid of flying.

04:16.738 --> 04:17.959
Here I come, Jake!

04:18.027 --> 04:20.551
Don't give up on me
and go hoooome!

04:21.238 --> 04:24.582
Don't worry about me, guys.
I'm happy to walk.

04:32.223 --> 04:34.004
What's taking Finn so long?

04:34.199 --> 04:37.404
Tell you what, he's got seven...
Six more minutes,

04:37.472 --> 04:39.318
and then I'm just heading
in there without him.

04:39.386 --> 04:41.513
I mean, I can't be expected to
sit here all day waiting for...

04:41.580 --> 04:44.098
Hey, Jake!
Ah, here he comes now.

04:44.793 --> 04:46.106
Sorry I'm late.
Uh!

04:46.191 --> 04:47.553
I had to go...
Thanks again, Finn.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.374
Bye! No problem.
See you later!

04:49.754 --> 04:51.918
Yeah, I had to rescue
princess orangutan there.

04:51.986 --> 04:53.684
But guess what?
She gave me a reward

04:53.776 --> 04:56.301
that's going to come in
very handy very soon.

04:56.465 --> 04:59.020
Ohhh.

05:03.074 --> 05:04.659
Look, I brought us
two gold coins

05:04.736 --> 05:05.910
so we can have
a locker each.

05:05.993 --> 05:08.059
No way! Oww! What the heck?!

05:08.164 --> 05:10.457
Sorry! I was just trying
to stop you putting the coin in

05:10.525 --> 05:12.019
before I showed you
my magical item.

05:12.087 --> 05:13.480
Well, I hope
it's a healing item

05:13.548 --> 05:16.457
after you just crimped my wrist
with a metal door!

05:16.555 --> 05:17.605
No, look.

05:17.673 --> 05:19.415
It's a magic token
that can fit in any slot.

05:19.484 --> 05:20.962
Watch.

05:22.495 --> 05:24.900
We've saved ourselves
two gold coins on lockers.

05:24.970 --> 05:27.746
Well, not really, 'cause the lockers
give you the coins back, anyway.

05:27.814 --> 05:30.142
Yeah, but this way only one
of us has to carry a key.

05:30.219 --> 05:33.296
Yeah, but if we lock my locker,
then lock my key in your locker,

05:33.364 --> 05:34.977
we would only have
to carry one key,

05:35.045 --> 05:36.228
but we'd still have
a whole locker each.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.446
Yeah, but could we just use
the reward I earned

05:38.514 --> 05:40.528
for being so brave and rescuing
a princess, please?

05:40.826 --> 05:42.211
Okay, fine.

05:42.279 --> 05:44.199
Thanks very much.

05:49.357 --> 05:53.763
Water slide!
Water slide! Water slide!

05:53.834 --> 05:55.654
No running on poolside,
guys.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.194
And we ask
that all pool users

05:57.262 --> 05:58.904
take a quick shower
on the way in.

05:59.005 --> 06:00.451
Cheers, guys.

06:03.217 --> 06:04.551
Hey, guess what, dude?

06:04.619 --> 06:06.162
See that big pile
of ginger hair

06:06.230 --> 06:07.670
and dirty bubbles
clogging the drain?

06:07.737 --> 06:08.888
Yeah?

06:08.943 --> 06:10.773
Well, that's your favorite snack
of all time!

06:10.841 --> 06:12.194
Yuck!
No way, bro!

06:12.274 --> 06:14.062
That's <i> your</i> favorite snack
of all time!

06:14.130 --> 06:15.416
Yuck! No way!

06:15.493 --> 06:16.674
Yes, way!

06:16.751 --> 06:18.319
Blech! Yuck!

06:19.280 --> 06:21.092
Ginger hair.
That's gross.

06:21.248 --> 06:25.828
Water slide!
Water slide! Water sliiiide!

06:29.296 --> 06:32.180
Okay, let's have one more
go on the slide,

06:32.274 --> 06:35.948
then I am turning this water
park into a frozen water park.

06:36.016 --> 06:38.296
And if anyone
doesn't like it, tough.

06:38.373 --> 06:39.557
Hey, ice king.
Hey, ice king.

06:39.625 --> 06:40.765
Oh! Uh... ha ha.

06:40.842 --> 06:43.727
I-I didn't recognize you two there
in your swimwear.

06:44.510 --> 06:47.258
Listen, guys, you'll get
no trouble from me today.

06:47.326 --> 06:51.071
I'm just enjoying a relaxing
day off, okay?

06:51.235 --> 06:52.986
Okay.

06:56.687 --> 06:58.258
Prank, prank, prank!
Idea for prank!

06:58.326 --> 06:59.821
Details for a prank!

07:01.289 --> 07:02.508
Ahem!

07:03.422 --> 07:05.556
Uh-oh!
I've just lost my nerve.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.422
Excuse me.
Comin' through.

07:07.490 --> 07:08.902
Ha ha, what a wimp.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.236
Good! Now kick, kick, kick,
kick, kick, kick, kick, kick!

07:11.303 --> 07:12.922
Can I borrow one of these?
Thank you!

07:13.476 --> 07:15.063
Can I take one of these?
Thank you.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.604
Right, off you go.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.750
Um, I just need
to work up my courage.

07:23.336 --> 07:25.047
What a pair
of absolute cowards.

07:29.898 --> 07:32.159
Okay, found my courage.

07:35.694 --> 07:37.437
Aqua brakes!

07:38.208 --> 07:40.074
Okay, dude.
You inflate yourself,

07:40.142 --> 07:41.937
but wait till
I'm out of the...

07:43.921 --> 07:45.206
Right. Next.

07:45.273 --> 07:46.757
Okay, you ready?

07:46.825 --> 07:49.584
Here we goooo!

07:52.592 --> 07:54.769
Hey!
What just happened?

07:54.837 --> 07:57.363
Could I ask you not to climb
back up the slide, sir?

07:57.431 --> 07:59.490
Just ride it all the way
to the bottom. Thanks.

07:59.597 --> 08:00.983
I didn't do anything!

08:01.051 --> 08:02.689
One minute
I was on my way down,

08:02.766 --> 08:04.715
and the next
I'm back up here!

08:04.840 --> 08:07.246
All right, let's try that one
again, shall we?

08:07.371 --> 08:10.285
Here we goooo!

08:12.133 --> 08:13.725
Now, hold on a minute.

08:13.802 --> 08:15.879
It's too dark to see,
but there must be a...

08:15.947 --> 08:17.381
A trampoline or something

08:17.449 --> 08:19.699
stuck in the tunnel
bouncing me back up.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.051
Very funny, sir.
I think I would've noticed

08:22.119 --> 08:24.569
someone bringing a trampoline
into the slide.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.037
Listen, you've got
one more chance

08:26.105 --> 08:27.590
to slide down properly,
okay?

08:27.658 --> 08:28.991
There are
other people waiting.

08:29.059 --> 08:30.575
What's the big hold up?

08:30.652 --> 08:31.919
What are you laughing at?

08:31.996 --> 08:33.821
You're something to do
with this!

08:33.898 --> 08:35.683
It's them!
Where's that dog?

08:35.808 --> 08:38.176
He can, like, go stretchy
and turn into things.

08:38.244 --> 08:39.803
I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:39.871 --> 08:41.715
Jake's up there sitting
in the viewing gallery.

08:41.783 --> 08:43.519
Look.
And he's reading a pamphlet.

08:44.575 --> 08:46.418
Hmmm...

08:47.453 --> 08:49.262
Keep your eyes
on that dog.

08:49.341 --> 08:50.965
Here we go.

08:52.207 --> 08:54.246
Oh, come on!

08:54.398 --> 08:56.691
Dog didn't move
a muscle, sir.

08:57.019 --> 08:59.160
- Let's see if it works for me
- Hey!

08:59.230 --> 09:00.699
Here comes Finn!

09:00.767 --> 09:03.144
No running
and no queue jumping!

09:09.190 --> 09:11.137
Nice work with the pamphlet,
by the way.

09:11.582 --> 09:13.324
It was just an extra detail.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.301
I'll go get rid
of the decoy.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.980
Well, that boy didn't seem to
have any trouble sliding down.

09:24.048 --> 09:25.168
Did you miss us?

09:26.186 --> 09:27.761
I don't now how you did it,

09:27.829 --> 09:30.629
but you'd better own up
and stop making a fool of me!

09:31.246 --> 09:32.723
Right! That's it!

09:32.825 --> 09:35.120
I can't have you assaulting
other pool users.

09:35.238 --> 09:37.764
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask
you to leave now, sir.

09:37.832 --> 09:41.590
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to freeze now, sir!

09:41.701 --> 09:43.496
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

09:43.674 --> 09:45.156
What?

09:45.255 --> 09:48.879
Hey, the water's turned my
fingers too pruny to do magic!

09:49.018 --> 09:50.061
Come in.

09:50.129 --> 09:52.105
Yeah, there's an old guy
lost the plot

09:52.173 --> 09:53.230
at the top of the slide.

09:53.307 --> 09:54.987
I'm getting
the duty manager involved.

09:55.055 --> 09:56.754
Fine, get him involved!

09:57.027 --> 09:59.949
But I'm not leaving until you
carry out a full investigation

10:00.017 --> 10:03.699
of this slide and question
that pair as prime suspects!

10:03.767 --> 10:05.074
Sorry, got to fly!

10:05.207 --> 10:06.737
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:06.814 --> 10:09.137
No sliding on the stairs!

10:09.309 --> 10:11.316
For goodness sake!

10:13.098 --> 10:14.444
Are you about
ready to go, Jake?

10:14.512 --> 10:16.280
Yeah, just need to fold up
my towel.

10:16.348 --> 10:19.074
And a lifetime ban means we'll
be keeping a picture of you

10:19.142 --> 10:21.418
behind reception
in case you try to come back.

10:21.486 --> 10:24.060
Well, why don't you blow
that picture up poster sized,

10:24.128 --> 10:25.144
frame it on the wall,

10:25.212 --> 10:27.066
and add a touch of class
to this dump!

10:27.144 --> 10:28.973
Ha ha!
That's good one.

10:29.059 --> 10:32.063
Oh, if you like that one,
you'll love this one!

10:32.140 --> 10:33.905
That's your favorite snack
of all time!

10:33.973 --> 10:36.051
That's <i> your</i> favorite snack
of all time!

10:37.691 --> 10:39.184
Get him out of here!

10:43.159 --> 10:44.480
- Thanks Sun!
- Thanks Sun!

10:44.548 --> 10:46.121
Did you guys have fun
at the water park?

10:46.269 --> 10:47.879
Yes and no.
But mostly yes.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.277
Did you teach
any kids to swim?

10:49.345 --> 10:51.019
As a matter of fact...

10:51.568 --> 10:52.934
Are you okay, Finn?

10:53.002 --> 10:54.150
Yeah, sorry.

10:54.218 --> 10:55.906
This orangutan hair
is inside my hood.

10:55.974 --> 10:57.592
I need to flush them out
in that puddle.

10:57.660 --> 11:00.488
No, wait!
That's the same puddle from before!

11:00.556 --> 11:01.604
Look, guys!

11:01.672 --> 11:02.995
My new court-jester
hat arrived!

11:03.063 --> 11:04.535
But it feels
a bit too tight.

11:04.615 --> 11:05.941
Jingle, jingle!

11:06.305 --> 11:12.921
