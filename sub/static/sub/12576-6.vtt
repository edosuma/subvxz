HANK: You know why I like Shelwyn's?

00:35.475 --> 00:38.103
Because I can always find something I like.

00:38.511 --> 00:40.206
Like those work shoes.

00:40.279 --> 00:43.146
A fella could get a lot of work done
in shoes like that.

00:43.216 --> 00:45.684
Do you think those earrings
would look nice on me?

00:45.752 --> 00:49.620
HANK: You got to think practical, Peggy.
Earrings don't keep you warm.

- I can't get these to work!
- Come on, son!

It's not like there's a science
to doing up your pants.

01:01.634 --> 01:04.330
Try to work with these, honey.
They are on sale.

01:04.404 --> 01:08.170
Excuse me. Can you show us
how to operate these pants?

01:08.241 --> 01:10.038
We're having some trouble.

01:11.110 --> 01:13.635
Can I talk to you privately for a moment?

01:14.814 --> 01:17.977
SALESPERSON: I'm wondering if maybe...
Gee, how do I put this?

01:18.284 --> 01:21.742
Maybe it's not quite the right time
in your son's life for Shelwyn's.

01:21.821 --> 01:23.413
What are you talking about?

01:23.489 --> 01:26.014
I just wonder if he might feel
a bit more at home...

01:26.092 --> 01:27.957
at a store like H. Dumpty's.

01:28.227 --> 01:29.421
What's H. Dumpty's?

01:29.495 --> 01:33.192
SALESPERSON: H. Dumpty's is a store
with special sizes for special kids.

01:33.266 --> 01:35.734
Are you talking about a fat kids' store?

01:35.802 --> 01:38.464
That word won't win you any friends
at H. Dumpty's.

Bobby is special in that way?

HANK: Let's go tell Bobby he's fat.
PEGGY: No, Hank.

01:52.218 --> 01:55.153
This is a very sensitive situation
for a little boy.

01:55.555 --> 01:57.819
We have to break it to him gently.

02:00.493 --> 02:01.960
Where are we going?

02:02.395 --> 02:05.558
We are going to a place
called H. Dumpty's, Bobby.

02:05.765 --> 02:07.528
What's that, a restaurant?

02:07.733 --> 02:09.598
It's a clothing store.

02:10.203 --> 02:14.011
- A different kind of clothing store.
- How is it different?

HANK: Sure.

02:23.153 --> 02:25.621
Some are a whole lot bigger than others.

02:25.689 --> 02:28.487
But that does not make them
any less beautiful.

Are you taking me to the vet?

02:39.003 --> 02:42.131
So many overalls.
Fun colors, too! Just super.

02:42.206 --> 02:46.074
You'd never guess they could stretch
as they do and still keep their shape.

02:46.443 --> 02:49.241
Must be using
some sort of advanced polymer.

02:49.413 --> 02:51.210

02:51.482 --> 02:54.178
BOBBY: Why do they have
to expand so much?

02:54.385 --> 02:58.549
I don't know. For sports
and skateboarding and things like that.

02:58.756 --> 03:02.157
A juvenile is always
stretching his clothes, you see.

03:04.695 --> 03:07.789
These kids don't look like they like sports.

03:07.865 --> 03:09.230
Sure they do.

They're wearing
sneakers and baseball caps, aren't they?

Now, son, come on. It's no big deal.

We're just shopping for clothes.
You've got nothing to feel bad about.

03:27.384 --> 03:29.045
In fact, you should be proud.

03:29.153 --> 03:33.112
You should be proud of who you are.
Yes, proud, because you are different...

03:33.323 --> 03:36.724
and being different is the best thing
in the whole wide world.

in letting him do something...

- that makes him feel good about himself?
- What's the harm?

a little more closely.

he ends up on Oprah...

but I think with the right handling...

Next week, I got him headlining
at the Little Junior Plus Fashion Show.

- Is that something Bobby could do?
- One step at a time, Mrs. Hill.

for Caulfield's of Texas.

around? Get a little exercise?

by those guys I hate.

you'd buy me if my grades improved.

to think about now.

12:11.580 --> 12:15.311
On camera or off?
Because they're two very different things.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.544
CARLO: Can we please have it quiet?

12:17.820 --> 12:21.916
Carlo is a little upset today.
He had a spat with Orlando.

12:22.458 --> 12:24.517
I am learning so much.

12:25.461 --> 12:27.827
PEGGY: Over here, Hank.
HANK: My God, Peggy...

12:27.897 --> 12:30.661
I feel like I've died and gone to New York!

12:30.733 --> 12:32.462
Come on, this is very exciting!

12:32.535 --> 12:35.060
I think Bobby may have found his calling.

12:35.337 --> 12:39.933
The director wants to put Bobby
in the Little Junior Plus Fashion Show.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.809
- The Little Junior what?
- Plus! It's this weekend.

12:43.879 --> 12:47.246
Orlando says they're going to broadcast it
on Arlen Cable Access.

12:47.316 --> 12:49.648
- But don't tell Carlo.
- No, don't tell Carlo.

12:49.718 --> 12:53.552
Why would I tell anything to Carlo?
Who the hell is Carlo?

12:57.293 --> 12:58.419
[Camera clicking]

12:58.494 --> 13:02.624
Okay. It's your birthday, yes?
You're older now.

13:02.698 --> 13:06.327
Where has the time gone, little man?
Yes, that's it.

13:06.402 --> 13:09.735
And you make a wish
for something magical.

13:09.805 --> 13:11.204
Don't tell!

13:11.273 --> 13:13.468
[Techno music playing]

13:14.276 --> 13:15.436
CARLO: Run!

13:15.811 --> 13:19.247
Look at you go! Go to the 50, go to the 60.

13:19.315 --> 13:21.681
This is your Olympic dream come true.

13:22.251 --> 13:25.015
They try to tackle you,
but you won't let them...

13:25.087 --> 13:26.987
because you look too fantastic.

13:28.090 --> 13:32.254
Hey there, lifeguard!
Look at you. Up on your perch so high.

13:32.328 --> 13:35.786
All around you
they splash and splash, but not you.

13:35.864 --> 13:40.358
Cut! That's it! Go home, everybody.
None of this ever happened.

13:40.436 --> 13:43.337
PEGGY: Hank, what are you doing?
HANK: I'm not doing anything.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.033
I'm not even here. None of us are. Let's go.

13:48.711 --> 13:49.871
[Gasping]

13:51.413 --> 13:52.641
- Hankie...
- No.

13:53.882 --> 13:55.213
- Dad...
- No!

13:57.119 --> 13:58.609
LUANNE: Uncle...
HANK: No!

13:58.687 --> 14:01.417
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

14:02.157 --> 14:06.594
It's not fair. I've been looking forward
to this fashion show for hours.

14:06.795 --> 14:10.231
I wanna be a part of history. Please?

14:10.332 --> 14:12.926
Bobby, there are times
when a father knows best...

14:13.002 --> 14:14.799
and this is one of those times.

14:16.038 --> 14:17.403
[Sighing]

14:18.474 --> 14:20.806
LUANNE: My hair is caught in the door.

14:23.245 --> 14:25.270
It's really our fault, Peggy.

14:25.347 --> 14:28.874
Somewhere along the line,
we forgot to teach Bobby shame.

14:29.418 --> 14:32.251
I guess we can't count on the schools
for everything.

14:32.554 --> 14:34.715
Well, good night. And don't worry.

14:34.790 --> 14:38.282
By tomorrow, he will have forgotten
all about that fashion show.

14:45.601 --> 14:47.000
[Brakes squeaking]

14:54.143 --> 14:56.373
Morning, Peggy. Where's Bobby?

14:56.845 --> 14:59.837
HANK: Don't tell me he's still sleeping.
PEGGY: Well, why not?

14:59.915 --> 15:01.906
What's he got to wake up for?

15:02.451 --> 15:04.282
I'd better go talk to him.

15:06.822 --> 15:10.724
Bobby, I know you're probably
pretty upset with me right now...

15:11.160 --> 15:15.893
but one day you'll understand how much
love it takes to crush a little boy's dreams.

15:16.265 --> 15:19.928
What do you say we get up
and have some breakfast together?

15:20.135 --> 15:21.124
Bobby?

[Tense instrumental music]

15:26.075 --> 15:29.169
Quick, Luanne. Bobby's run off!
You got to tell me where he is.

15:30.212 --> 15:32.407
Oh, no! Not you, too!

15:32.948 --> 15:34.142
[All screaming]

15:34.483 --> 15:37.577
I'm in a crisis situation here.
I got to go find Bobby.

15:37.653 --> 15:40.349
You two take turns
kicking each other's asses.

I'm Bobby Hill. I'm here for the show.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.102
Bobby Hill. You're talent.

16:04.279 --> 16:06.679
Here's your complimentary tote bag.

16:06.849 --> 16:08.111
BOBBY: Toilet water.

16:08.183 --> 16:11.311
Cool! That's, like, for an emergency
or something, right?

16:11.820 --> 16:14.084
PEGGY: It does not matter
how fast you drive, Hank.

16:14.156 --> 16:16.818
We'll never get there on time.
We might as well face it.

16:16.892 --> 16:20.760
- We're missing his big moment.
- No, we're stopping his big moment.

16:20.829 --> 16:23.525
I didn't fill up with 89 octane for nothing.

16:29.972 --> 16:32.998
- What is this?
- It's a fashion show for plus-size boys.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.134
There's going to be music, a fog machine...

16:35.210 --> 16:38.702
and it all goes to benefit the schools.
Plus free doughnuts.

16:38.781 --> 16:40.646
We'll do it for the schools.

16:54.630 --> 16:56.188
I'm gonna be in the show with you.

16:56.265 --> 17:00.201
Don't put your stuff down there!
I called this whole makeup counter.

17:00.335 --> 17:05.204
- Did you get a free bag?
- Yeah. It's the worst one I've ever seen.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.741
- Do you want to get into trouble?
- No.

17:45.948 --> 17:49.042
Hey, never say
I don't hustle for you, Bobby.

17:49.117 --> 17:51.745
It's a done deal. You're going on first.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.644
First? Me?

17:54.289 --> 17:56.086
But what will Andy Maynard think?

what Andy Maynard thinks.

- Do you really think I'm ready for this?
- I don't think you're ready.

18:09.805 --> 18:11.329
I know you are.

Now, go out there
and knock 'em dead, sailor boy.

HANK: Are you gonna come quietly,
or do I carry you out baby-tantrum style?

18:19.882 --> 18:22.077
You can't make me leave, Dad.

18:22.150 --> 18:25.745
I'm going on first.
I've never been first in anything.

18:25.821 --> 18:29.689
HANK: Tell you what. You can be the first
to drop out of this show. Come on.

18:29.758 --> 18:32.693
Why are you always trying
to turn me into you?

18:32.761 --> 18:36.403
Why can't you accept me for who I am?

18:37.304 --> 18:41.468
We both saw that after-school special,
but I'm not an alcoholic...

18:41.541 --> 18:45.375
- and you're not an ice skater. So let's go.
- But it's not fair.

18:45.445 --> 18:49.438
Come on, son. I'm just trying
to keep you from being embarrassed.

18:49.916 --> 18:54.250
Is that what you're afraid of?
Or are you afraid you'll be embarrassed?

or aren't you?

19:02.496 --> 19:04.191
I'm sorry, Mr. Stokes.

19:04.264 --> 19:07.062
I want to do the show
but my dad won't let me.

19:07.567 --> 19:10.559
I guess I'll never get my moment
in the spotlight.

HANK: Bobby, wait.
BOBBY: Yes, Dad?

19:15.242 --> 19:18.439

till we get to the car?

I just know something
about human nature, son.

If you put teenagers
and husky boys and doughnuts...

all in the same place,
you are just asking for trouble.

a father knows what's best for his kid.

And the mother, although well-meaning,
is usually wrong.

Usually wrong?

is still higher than yours, mister.
