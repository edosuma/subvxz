The core?
Oh, this is too easy.

13:22.261 --> 13:25.973
Once I make my way there,
your planet will go micro-nova

13:26.140 --> 13:30.728
and become a miniature sun, with
me as its supreme alderman.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.313
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

13:33.314 --> 13:35.399
Oh, no, you probably don't!

13:40.779 --> 13:41.989
(GRUNTS)

13:46.285 --> 13:47.578
Gotcha.

13:50.748 --> 13:52.166
If I can't extinguish you,

13:52.249 --> 13:54.126
I'll take you where there's
nothing flammable,

13:54.251 --> 13:55.961
so you can't do
any more harm.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.262
Turn back, Bender!
Turn back or else!

14:05.429 --> 14:06.930
Or else what?

14:09.099 --> 14:10.434
Or else that.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.272
Nice try, flame bag,

14:15.356 --> 14:18.650
but now you're trapped here with
me for the next billion years.

14:18.734 --> 14:20.861
I've saved
the entire world!

14:21.278 --> 14:23.405
And no one
will ever know.

14:31.789 --> 14:33.248
(SNIFFLING)
(TEAR CLINKS)

14:49.264 --> 14:51.183
Huh?
Yes, hi.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.852
I'm from the vampire bank
that burned down.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.604
I have what remains
of the contents

14:55.687 --> 14:59.233
of a safe deposit box belonging
to a Bender B. Rodriguez.

14:59.817 --> 15:01.318
Thank you.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.782
Bender's medal.
It melted in the fire.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.493
Wait a second.

15:13.414 --> 15:15.457
You can't keep
me here forever.

15:15.666 --> 15:18.836
Sooner or later,
a polar bear will happen by.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.588
A nice,
flammable polar bear.

15:22.339 --> 15:25.509
Polar bears don't burn.
I've tried many times.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.140
Bendefl

15:31.223 --> 15:33.267
Fry? How'd you find me?

15:33.350 --> 15:35.060
Lused
the Find My Robot app.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.188
BENDER: Neat.
What was it, 99 cents?

15:38.272 --> 15:40.357
No, free.
But it's got ads on it.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.692
That seems fair.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.778
Look,BendeL
I'm sorry for doubting you.

15:44.903 --> 15:49.324
I realize now that you're a true
hero, not a glory seeking arsonist.

15:49.533 --> 15:50.742
How'd you figure it out?

15:50.868 --> 15:52.119
Your burnt-up medal.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.371
I know you would
never set a fire

15:54.455 --> 15:56.457
that would endanger
your own valuables.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.709
Of course not.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.419
It was
a psychotic flame creature

16:00.502 --> 16:02.087
from the sun who
set those fires.

16:02.796 --> 16:03.839
Flame creature?

16:03.922 --> 16:06.508
That's right.
Fry, meet flame-o.

16:07.217 --> 16:10.179
That's not a flame creature.
It's your pilot light.

16:10.471 --> 16:13.348
No. It's a fire monster
from outer space,

16:13.432 --> 16:16.477
and I'm heroically saving the
world by trapping him here.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.021
So it was you.

16:20.063 --> 16:23.567
You're so desperate for glory, you
made up this whole orazy story.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.736
Here's your medal, hero.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.125
Stupid Bender.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.586
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

16:47.591 --> 16:48.759
(CHUCKLES EVILLY)

16:51.136 --> 16:52.638
There, finished.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.474
Man, I'm good at this,
eh, flame-o?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.809
Yo, flame-o!

(ALARM BLARING)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

17:12.449 --> 17:14.451
So, where's
the fire this time?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.203
Here.
Where?

17:16.286 --> 17:18.413
Here! Literally, here!

17:19.790 --> 17:21.290
(ALL GASPING)

17:39.601 --> 17:41.687
It's like the flame
has a mind of its own!

17:41.853 --> 17:43.897
It's deaky!
Freaky deaky!

17:48.694 --> 17:50.571
This fire's unstoppable!

17:50.654 --> 17:52.447
Thank God we all
got out of there.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.032
FRY: Someone save me!

17:55.158 --> 17:58.495
I made a rope from my clothes,
but then this fire started.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.122
Raise the main ladder!

18:04.626 --> 18:06.295
Don't lose hope, Fry!

18:06.503 --> 18:08.255
What kind of
coffin do you want?

18:13.260 --> 18:14.344
(GRUNTS)

18:17.723 --> 18:20.767
Bender? I should have known
you started this fire.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.686
Just another chance
to be a hero.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.188
Well, you're not saving me.
Not this time.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.774
I don't have time
for this shazbot.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.985
You're getting heroed,
whether you like it or...

18:38.035 --> 18:41.455
If you're done saving me from
the fire monster from the sun,

18:41.538 --> 18:42.873
I'll be on my way.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.378
I guess some grown men
just don't like being carried.

18:48.545 --> 18:52.049
Thank you, Bender. You brought
me right to the lava pit.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.216
(LAUGHS)

18:54.760 --> 18:55.802
And another thing.

18:55.886 --> 18:57.471
If someone gives
you a nice medal,

18:57.554 --> 18:59.890
you should be responsible
enough to care for it.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.558
Fry?
Yeah?

19:01.892 --> 19:03.435
Shut up!
I got to do hero stuff.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.440
All the lava in the world
won't wash away your lies.

19:14.738 --> 19:15.781
(GASPING)

19:15.864 --> 19:18.909
We are the mystic
aldermen of the sun.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.327
Okay.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.079
Stand back, please.

19:22.621 --> 19:23.747
Okay.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.918
Unhand me!

19:29.336 --> 19:31.421
Thank you for your heroism,
Earth Robot.

19:32.589 --> 19:36.760
You have saved your planet from
becoming a lifeless ball of fire.

19:37.135 --> 19:40.472
You are now the greatest hero
in Earth's history.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.849
Yes! Suck it, Gilgamesh!

19:43.141 --> 19:44.726
Goodbye forever.

19:44.810 --> 19:47.229
No! I won't go back! I won't...

19:49.773 --> 19:52.526
Holy crap! All your
crazy stories were true!

19:52.609 --> 19:54.611
You saved
the entire Earth!

19:54.861 --> 19:56.822
Yes. Yes, I did.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.449
(SIGHS) But no one
will ever believe me.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.618
Yes. They will.
I'll vouch for you.

20:02.077 --> 20:04.246
No. They won't
believe you either.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.666
If you even tell anyone I was
here, they'll say I set the fire.

20:07.958 --> 20:10.961
So, please,
for me, cram it?

20:11.253 --> 20:12.754
No! The world has
to know that...

20:12.838 --> 20:14.965
AMY: Fry?
Are you down here?

20:17.175 --> 20:19.803
He's all right!
Praise Gilgamesh!

20:25.642 --> 20:27.561
So you started the fire?

20:27.811 --> 20:29.312
I'm afraid so.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.356
Bender was
thousands of miles away.

20:31.648 --> 20:34.276
I guess a welding torch
is no way to catch a rat.

20:34.526 --> 20:37.070
What were you thinking? This
is coming out of your pay!

20:38.155 --> 20:40.407
Well, I'm back.
What'd I miss?

20:40.490 --> 20:41.867
Looks like
the building burned down.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.994
Yeah, thanks
to this dope.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.996
(GASPS) Fry did it?

20:46.872 --> 20:48.665
Ow!
You're a horrible person!

20:48.749 --> 20:51.960
And your carelessness nearly
cost the life of my best friend.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.296
(WHISPERS) You.
