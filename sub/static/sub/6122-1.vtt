00:42.860 --> 00:44.860
Bradley, tell me how old you are, please.

00:44.940 --> 00:46.270
28 years old.

00:46.340 --> 00:48.420
- What do you do for a living?
- In-home sales.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.830
Okay. And Lisa, what about you?

00:51.900 --> 00:53.420
I'm 28. I'm a teacher.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.580
Okay. Teacher.

00:56.660 --> 00:58.700
And how long have you guys been married?

00:58.780 --> 00:59.780
10 years.

00:59.980 --> 01:02.790
Okay. At least we're in agreement about that.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.900
Do you have any children?

01:06.020 --> 01:07.060
No.

01:07.140 --> 01:08.260
No children.

01:09.620 --> 01:11.110
Do you want children?

01:12.980 --> 01:13.980
I do.

01:14.180 --> 01:15.780
Okay.

01:16.700 --> 01:17.820
Bradley?

01:18.020 --> 01:19.430
I just think we need to be in a better place

01:19.500 --> 01:20.860
before we bring somebody else into it.

01:21.100 --> 01:22.140
Okay.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.660
Do you wanna say something, Lisa?

01:24.980 --> 01:28.100
I love him. It's just that I think
people change. Don't you agree?

01:28.300 --> 01:29.710
Yeah. They do.

01:29.980 --> 01:33.380
I often feel like we become
a lot of different people

01:33.460 --> 01:36.030
before we actually settle into who we are.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.940
Especially when we're young.

01:38.020 --> 01:39.590
We were 18.

01:39.660 --> 01:42.550
I'm not the same little girl
that was in love with him in high school.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.140
But I still love you.

01:45.820 --> 01:49.460
Tell me what you want me to do.
I promise I can change.

01:50.020 --> 01:50.980
Tell me, please.

01:51.060 --> 01:52.220
Just don't do that.

01:52.340 --> 01:54.340
I can't do this.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.060
I'm sorry.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.460
Bradley, don't. I'm sorry.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.220
I don't wanna hurt him. He deserves better.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.340
Better than you?

02:09.340 --> 02:10.540
Yeah.

02:11.180 --> 02:12.670
Why do you feel that way?

02:14.340 --> 02:15.540
He's a good guy.

02:16.860 --> 02:18.980
He's consistent and loving.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.780
But I feel like we're roommates
and not husband and wife.

02:24.220 --> 02:25.460
You met someone?

02:29.540 --> 02:32.060
And he's showing you
everything you've been missing.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.620
This new guy, he excites you.

02:36.580 --> 02:41.820
He buys you flowers
and he tells you that you're beautiful.

02:42.780 --> 02:45.060
He says all the things that Brad doesn't.

02:48.420 --> 02:51.420
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm not here to judge you.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.660
I just think, if you're honest with me,

02:53.740 --> 02:56.180
then we can get to the root
of the real issues.

03:01.860 --> 03:03.900
I'd like to tell you a story.

03:04.260 --> 03:06.380
About my sister. If that's okay.

03:10.780 --> 03:14.300
Judith. That was her name.

03:15.940 --> 03:20.070
I knew her so well. We were so close.

03:21.780 --> 03:24.430
<i>We were raised in a very small town.</i>

03:25.300 --> 03:27.300
<i>And our mother, Sarah,</i>

03:27.580 --> 03:30.060
<i>she took us to church five days a week.</i>

03:30.260 --> 03:31.940
<i>And twice on Sundays.</i>

03:32.300 --> 03:34.580
<i>There wasn't a lotta time for fun.</i>

03:35.140 --> 03:38.220
<i>And boys? Forget about it.</i>

03:39.300 --> 03:41.620
<i>From the moment Judith and Brice met,</i>

03:41.820 --> 03:44.300
<i>something sparked between them.</i>

03:45.780 --> 03:47.780
<i>They became inseparable.</i>

03:48.660 --> 03:50.820
<i>They were the yin and yang to each other.</i>

03:57.140 --> 04:00.140
<i>Now, Sarah tried to keep
a strict hand on Judith,</i>

04:02.780 --> 04:04.580
<i>but Judith was in love.</i>

04:06.180 --> 04:07.670
<i>And so was Brice.</i>

04:07.860 --> 04:09.460
Yes, she's asleep. I promise.

04:09.620 --> 04:10.780
Let's go. Come on.

04:14.980 --> 04:15.980
Stop.

04:16.980 --> 04:19.220
<i>You see, love, for Judith,</i>

04:19.340 --> 04:21.500
<i>seemed to be different from other people.</i>

04:22.100 --> 04:24.620
<i>For her, it was all-consuming.</i>

04:25.100 --> 04:27.220
<i>It was breath to life.</i>

04:44.580 --> 04:49.540
<i>Most times, they didn't even notice
that Sarah was watching them.</i>

04:53.100 --> 04:54.430
Gonna see you tomorrow.

04:54.660 --> 04:59.380
<i>Somewhere along the way,
she decided she couldn't fight this.</i>

05:00.420 --> 05:02.020
<i>Maybe this was meant to be.</i>

05:02.420 --> 05:05.820
<i>Or in her own words,
"Maybe it was God's will."</i>

05:06.700 --> 05:10.220
<i>Judith was so worried
when Brice asked for her hand in marriage.</i>

05:10.380 --> 05:14.060
<i>She just knew her mother would say, "No."
But she reluctantly said...</i>

05:14.220 --> 05:15.380
Yes.

05:24.380 --> 05:27.110
<i>I'll tell ya, if smiles were dollars,</i>

05:27.580 --> 05:29.380
<i>they would have had millions.</i>

05:30.980 --> 05:31.980
Bye!

05:32.740 --> 05:35.060
<i>At last, they were together.</i>

05:35.700 --> 05:37.700
<i>And life began.</i>

05:51.420 --> 05:53.580
<i>They found this cute little place together.</i>

05:53.900 --> 05:55.060
I won! No, I won!

05:55.260 --> 05:58.300
<i>They didn't have much,
but they had each other.</i>

05:58.540 --> 06:00.460
So slow. Come on! What you waiting for?

06:00.700 --> 06:03.060
<i>And they were more in love than ever.</i>

06:03.820 --> 06:07.660
<i>Brice's lifelong dream
was to work in a small pharmacy</i>

06:07.780 --> 06:09.110
<i>that maybe one day he could own.</i>

06:11.620 --> 06:13.270
<i>And Judith, well,</i>

06:13.460 --> 06:15.980
<i>her dream was to become
a marriage counselor.</i>

06:16.220 --> 06:17.630
<i>But that wasn't easy.</i>

06:17.820 --> 06:20.900
<i>So in the meantime,
she found work with Janice Wise,</i>

06:21.100 --> 06:23.100
<i>the millionaire matchmaker.</i>

06:23.900 --> 06:26.100
- Good morning.
- Bonjour.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.660
Good morning.

06:27.740 --> 06:29.620
Your 8:00 a.m. is on his way up.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.220
- He's early.
- Yeah.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.300
Okay. <i>Merci.</i>

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
Here you go. Yeah.

06:37.140 --> 06:38.900
Look at those shoes.

06:39.020 --> 06:41.260
Yeah? I didn't notice. Thank you.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.940
I wasn't talking about hers,
I was talking about yours.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.140
They look like orthopedic shoes.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.460
Judith, we've been
going over this for weeks.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.860
Look around this office. What do you see?

06:54.020 --> 06:56.340
A bunch of women with hair from India?

06:57.420 --> 06:58.990
Look at me, Judith.

07:00.140 --> 07:03.820
What you should see is people in this office
care about what they look like.

07:04.020 --> 07:05.380
Unlike you.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.190
We have over a billion dollars

07:07.340 --> 07:09.660
walking in and out of these offices
looking for love.

07:09.820 --> 07:12.660
We have a standard to uphold.
This is not our standard.

07:12.820 --> 07:14.580
Okay, Ava,

07:14.660 --> 07:18.260
I don't have to wear fancy dresses
or fancy shoes

07:18.340 --> 07:20.500
to prove that I'm qualified to do my job.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.140
Yes, you do.

07:22.340 --> 07:24.500
- No, I don't. I have a degree.
- Yeah, you do.

07:24.660 --> 07:26.230
- A degree?
- Yes.

07:26.460 --> 07:29.190
A degree on the wall
without labels on your back is nothing.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.500
Where are you from, new girl?

07:32.740 --> 07:33.820
Belvedere.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.740
Where the hell is that?

07:36.140 --> 07:37.180
In the South.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.820
The South. That explains it.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.860
You grew up below the Mason-Dixon.

07:42.020 --> 07:44.860
Okay, Ava, you really should take a Valium.

07:45.060 --> 07:47.500
You really need an iron to that skirt.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.700
What?

07:48.780 --> 07:49.900
I did.

07:51.340 --> 07:54.940
Say no more. That blouse. It's telling it all.

07:55.060 --> 07:56.630
So does your dress.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.540
What's wrong with my dress?

08:00.380 --> 08:02.380
Can you even breathe, Ava?

08:03.540 --> 08:05.780
You don't breathe in Herve.

08:06.780 --> 08:08.460
Follow me, Mr. Madison,
Janice is waiting for you.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.550
Oh, my God.

08:13.220 --> 08:14.220
Who's that?

08:14.420 --> 08:16.180
You're killing me.
You don't know who that is?

08:16.260 --> 08:17.540
No.

08:17.700 --> 08:21.700
The third largest social media
inventor since Zuckerberg?

08:22.060 --> 08:24.220
Class-Meet? What planet are you from?

08:24.460 --> 08:26.110
What is he doing here?

08:26.340 --> 08:29.070
Please, don't tell me he's here
to get fixed up by The Madam.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.910
She is no madam.
You need to bite your tongue.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.620
She's a matchmaker
and she's very good at her job.

08:34.860 --> 08:36.430
Yeah. So are pimps.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.660
Come. Please.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.340
Stay right there.
I know she was talking to me.

08:42.420 --> 08:43.580
Whatever.

08:46.380 --> 08:47.460
Here we go.

08:48.140 --> 08:49.220
Yes?

08:49.420 --> 08:53.310
Ava, this handsome young man
is looking to find a lot of answers

08:53.380 --> 08:55.300
as to how we do things around here.

08:55.460 --> 08:56.460
Take notes, please.

08:57.460 --> 08:59.900
Are you looking for a date?

09:00.820 --> 09:03.740
I'm sure this handsome face
has no problem getting dates.

09:03.820 --> 09:04.980
Well,

09:05.780 --> 09:07.460
I'm actually in between
relationships right now.

09:07.660 --> 09:09.980
So you could use our services?

09:10.620 --> 09:13.270
Well, I prefer the old-fashioned way
of meeting women.

09:14.060 --> 09:15.860
You like to pay?

09:15.940 --> 09:18.380
No, that's not what I meant.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.070
What exactly do you do?

09:25.140 --> 09:26.300
Me?

09:27.780 --> 09:28.820
Yes.

09:29.140 --> 09:31.020
I'm the in-house therapist.

09:31.260 --> 09:33.660
This is Judith.

09:34.460 --> 09:35.580
Judith.

09:37.380 --> 09:40.220
Well, Judith,
you are who I'd like to speak to.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.140
Judith, Harley is looking
to invest in my company.

09:43.780 --> 09:47.500
We want to take Wise Counsel
online and international.

09:48.300 --> 09:49.660
Okay.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.660
Well, before I make that type of investment,

09:51.820 --> 09:54.660
I like to be quite certain
of what I'm getting myself into.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.300
I totally understand.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.860
And Judith will take great care of you.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.460
Ava, clear Judith's schedule.

10:04.540 --> 10:08.820
Judith, please, answer any questions
Mr. Madison may have.

10:09.820 --> 10:12.220
Sure. Come right this way.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.340
All right.

10:14.460 --> 10:15.500
Bye. Nice to meet you.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.900
So you gonna start today?

10:22.700 --> 10:24.980
I think so. Thank you so much.

10:25.060 --> 10:28.140
Don't thank me yet.
Did you show her what she's gonna do?

10:28.340 --> 10:31.340
Yes, ma'am. She'll be working the register
and stocking the shelves.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.460
I check the register at random every day,

10:35.540 --> 10:38.270
so you're gonna have to
account for every dime.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.900
- No problem.
- Random!

10:41.180 --> 10:42.220
I got it.

10:42.420 --> 10:45.340
Brice tells me you're from Boston?

10:48.100 --> 10:49.220
Yeah.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.940
You don't sound like you come from Boston.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.380
Do you know Boston?

10:56.020 --> 10:58.750
No. I've never been there. Yet.

10:59.780 --> 11:01.350
What part of Boston?

11:01.860 --> 11:03.060
Roxbury.

11:12.660 --> 11:13.900
Are you married?

11:15.020 --> 11:16.350
No. I'm not married.

11:16.420 --> 11:17.540
Do you have kids?

11:18.140 --> 11:19.180
No.

11:27.460 --> 11:28.950
So should I get to work?

11:29.060 --> 11:32.540
Yeah, there's a box of deodorant
under the counter

11:32.620 --> 11:34.660
that needs to be restocked.
You can start there.

11:34.740 --> 11:35.740
Okay.

11:36.420 --> 11:38.700
Nice meeting you. Thank you.

11:40.020 --> 11:41.100
Hey-

11:43.260 --> 11:46.980
No husband?
And that blouse she's wearing?

11:47.220 --> 11:48.300
And those boots?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.260
She's a lesbian.

11:56.620 --> 11:57.950
Does it matter?

11:59.100 --> 12:02.660
No. I don't think people will think
there's anything between us,

12:02.740 --> 12:05.180
but you never know. People talk.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.300
Yeah.

12:10.140 --> 12:13.620
Matchmaking. I don't know
how I feel about all this.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.620
I'm sorry?

12:16.140 --> 12:17.980
Well, it's a dating service for the rich.

12:18.180 --> 12:22.260
I just... I'm not sure this is something
I should be investing in.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.140
You know, it's kinda strange.

12:25.220 --> 12:26.300
Yeah.

12:27.340 --> 12:29.420
So you agree with that?

12:29.660 --> 12:30.900
A little bit. Yeah.

12:36.660 --> 12:37.990
So I shouldn't invest?

12:39.100 --> 12:40.340
I'm not saying that.

12:40.820 --> 12:42.500
I would never say that.

12:43.820 --> 12:45.820
Like you said, it's a little strange.

12:46.180 --> 12:47.980
A little odd. Little unnatural.

12:48.460 --> 12:51.660
Bunch of old guys paying to meet women.

12:52.340 --> 12:55.020
I'm gonna shut up. I'm saying too much.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.660
No, no, honestly, continue, please.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.580
I kind of prefer the old-fashioned way
of finding love, but...

13:00.660 --> 13:03.310
Well, I completely agree. I do.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.700
But, let me play devil's advocate.

13:06.220 --> 13:09.700
So, more than half of all new relationships
are started online in this day and age.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.420
- Yeah.
- Right.

13:11.500 --> 13:15.300
So it's obvious, she definitely...
She has something going here.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.860
I'm just not sure exactly how I fit into it.

13:18.020 --> 13:21.540
That's why I'm here.
To help you figure that out.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.900
I think we can start with the Wise Counsel
questionnaire that I developed.

13:25.140 --> 13:29.900
And pretty much we use it to see
whether or not someones compatible.

13:32.820 --> 13:35.220
Do I know you from somewhere?

13:35.820 --> 13:38.060
I doubt we run in the same circles.

13:38.660 --> 13:39.700
Do you run?

13:40.060 --> 13:41.060
Yeah, every day at...

13:41.220 --> 13:43.700
Landover Park. I knew it.

13:44.540 --> 13:45.540
You run there?

13:45.660 --> 13:48.860
8:00 a.m. every Saturday.
Start at the wheelhouse...

13:49.060 --> 13:51.710
I think I have seen you run past me before.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.740
You're that cheesy guy always running
with his shirt off and making grunts.

13:54.900 --> 13:55.980
- I'm not cheesy.
- Yeah, you are.

13:56.060 --> 13:57.060
I get hot.

13:57.180 --> 13:58.900
No, you're running with your shirt off

13:59.060 --> 14:00.710
so all the pretty girls could notice you.

14:00.900 --> 14:02.260
Well, you noticed me, right?

14:10.660 --> 14:11.740
Turn to page two.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.380
You'll see the compatibility questionnaire.

14:14.620 --> 14:15.660
All business.

14:15.740 --> 14:16.860
I wanted to start with that.

14:16.980 --> 14:17.980
I like that.

14:25.060 --> 14:26.100
Hey, you.

14:26.940 --> 14:28.780
How was your third week? Any better?

14:30.780 --> 14:31.900
Oh, God.

14:34.060 --> 14:35.420
<i>That bad, huh'?</i>

14:38.220 --> 14:40.790
Honey, what am I doing there?

14:40.940 --> 14:42.430
I have a master's degree.

14:42.620 --> 14:47.100
Why am I wasting my time in some snobby
office helping old men get a date?

14:47.340 --> 14:51.940
Is that what I busted my butt in college
and graduated early for?

14:52.180 --> 14:53.510
Like, it don't make sense.

14:53.740 --> 14:55.310
Babe, it'll get there.

14:55.860 --> 14:59.020
But, baby, I really feel like I'm getting stuck.

14:59.100 --> 15:01.140
You know what I had to do today?

15:01.300 --> 15:07.180
I just spent three hours with some cheesy
computer guy named Harley something.

15:07.460 --> 15:08.820
The Class-Meet guy?

15:09.460 --> 15:10.820
Was he looking for a date?

15:11.260 --> 15:14.620
No. Does everyone know
about this guy except for me?

15:14.820 --> 15:16.470
Baby, you should. He's loaded.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.300
Wow. You sound like Ava.

15:19.540 --> 15:23.100
Man. I have to get outta there
and start my own practice.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.180
Babe, that's a long ways off.

15:25.260 --> 15:29.060
I figure in about 10 to 15 years

15:29.140 --> 15:31.020
we'll be established enough
to take that chance.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.340
But right now you don't need
to be thinking about that.

15:33.980 --> 15:35.310
10 to 15 years?

15:35.500 --> 15:39.710
Great, that's encouraging. Thanks, baby.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.180
And my mother called me today.

15:43.380 --> 15:47.060
And she's coming into town
for some revival or something.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.140
Which is just what I need.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.350
The stress of this job
and the judgment of my mother.

15:52.540 --> 15:55.060
You know she's gonna be
bothering me about you, asking me,

15:55.140 --> 15:57.710
"Judith Ann, have you been
doing your wifely duties?"

15:57.900 --> 15:59.900
Yes, Mother, I have been cooking for him,

15:59.980 --> 16:00.980
I have been cleaning,

16:01.060 --> 16:02.940
and I have been having sex with him
three times a week,

16:03.020 --> 16:04.350
just like it says in the Bible.

16:04.860 --> 16:06.510
It says three times a week, baby?

16:06.700 --> 16:08.190
Then you've been slacking.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.620
Shut up. I'm kidding.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.380
I'm not. And...

16:14.060 --> 16:16.710
You know that little thing you do
on birthdays and holidays?

16:16.860 --> 16:19.590
I wonder what your mother
would say about that.

16:19.660 --> 16:21.460
My mother doesn't know
about that little trick

16:21.540 --> 16:23.110
I give you on birthdays and holidays.

16:23.180 --> 16:25.750
And if she did, you wouldn't get it anymore.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.140
I'm gonna get up.
I'm gonna go make you some dinner.

16:31.220 --> 16:33.580
No. You know what I'm gonna do for you?

16:33.860 --> 16:35.140
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.620
That $1.99 buffet again, baby?

16:37.900 --> 16:39.780
Made my stomach hurt.

16:40.220 --> 16:42.870
No, I'm gonna take you
somewhere nice and fancy.

16:44.260 --> 16:46.540
- Really?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.

16:47.620 --> 16:50.220
Okay, I'm gonna go put my shoes back on.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.660
I'm gonna take you to the $5.99 buffet.

16:54.740 --> 16:56.420
All right, you!

16:59.380 --> 17:00.380
All right.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.470
- I did.
- Good.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.740
And maybe next time we go,
the lady next to us...

17:04.980 --> 17:07.180
I was watching
and she had the artichoke dip.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.500
- I wanna order that next time.
- I saw it.

17:08.580 --> 17:09.780
- It did look good.
- With the chips.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.500
With the different color chips.
That looked so good.

17:11.580 --> 17:12.660
- Now that.
- With the enchiladas, too.

17:12.780 --> 17:14.580
That's a fine ass bitch right there.

17:15.060 --> 17:16.740
- Was he talking to me?
- Babe, keep walking.

17:16.820 --> 17:18.390
I know you ain't talkin' to me.

17:18.460 --> 17:21.030
- Show some respect. Kick your ass to hell.
- Baby, come on!

17:21.100 --> 17:23.860
- You know what? You need to be in church!
- Damn it, get in the car, Judith!

17:23.940 --> 17:25.460
Pick up the Bible
since you ain't got no good tact!

17:25.540 --> 17:27.140
- Judith, get in the car.
- Your mama shoulda taught...

17:28.140 --> 17:30.580
Why would you let these
assholes ruin our night?

17:30.660 --> 17:33.390
Ain't got no kind of manners.
What the hell they talkin' to me like that for?

17:33.460 --> 17:34.870
This is crazy.

17:34.940 --> 17:36.860
Thinking I'm just some
regular bitch on the street.

17:36.940 --> 17:38.270
Enough, Judith.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.460
- Think they can talk to me like that?
- Enough! Let it go.

17:40.580 --> 17:41.660
I showed 'em!

17:41.780 --> 17:42.980
Just let it go. it doesn't matter.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.140
Their mama shoulda taught them better.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.180
She shoulda had them in school.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.710
- Judith. Judith!
- Not hanging on the street.

17:47.780 --> 17:48.900
Common whore!

17:48.980 --> 17:50.580
- You stupid joker!
- Judith!

18:26.900 --> 18:30.660
Baby, you been really quiet since dinner.
Did I miss something?

18:34.660 --> 18:36.340
You didn't hear that guy?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.500
Babe, I knew that was it.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.820
Yes, I heard him.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.980
Some things you just gotta ignore.

18:49.860 --> 18:53.180
Why can't I ignore the fact
that I didn't feel safe?

18:55.900 --> 18:58.380
Babe, those guys coulda had guns.

18:59.140 --> 19:00.710
We did the right thing.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.540
I just don't like the way I feel.

19:14.540 --> 19:17.270
Baby, I will always protect you.

19:18.780 --> 19:20.380
I'd die for you.

19:29.140 --> 19:30.940
I just wanna go to sleep.

19:40.420 --> 19:41.580
I'm sorry.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.380
I'm with you. If you say "go," I go.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.470
You! Stop it.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.940
- No, I'm being serious.
- You are the worst.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.710
No, come on.

20:11.260 --> 20:15.820
Judith, Harley and I have been going over
the questionnaire you came up with

20:15.900 --> 20:18.020
and he has some questions for you.

20:19.220 --> 20:22.540
You will be putting in some late hours
trying to help him.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.380
You don't mind, do you, mon cheri?

20:24.700 --> 20:25.780
All right.

20:25.860 --> 20:27.270
I will be in my office, darling.

20:27.340 --> 20:29.500
Okay. Okay.

20:33.460 --> 20:34.500
Okay.

20:34.580 --> 20:35.820
So you have some questions?

20:35.940 --> 20:37.020
Yes. Yes.

20:37.340 --> 20:39.540
Now, this is actually really good.

20:40.220 --> 20:41.460
Thank you.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.260
I need to formulate a program
that's gonna tell me

20:43.340 --> 20:45.460
what kinda person we're dealing with
just based on your questions.

20:46.020 --> 20:47.700
That's a program I'd like to see.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.390
Well, good, because I need you
to help me build it.

20:49.780 --> 20:51.540
I'm not a programmer.

20:52.380 --> 20:55.110
Well, that's fine.
I just need your expertise on humans.

20:55.180 --> 20:57.100
All of these questions here.

20:57.180 --> 20:59.830
Now, they tell you a little something
about the prospective client, right?

21:00.340 --> 21:02.700
Yes. As well as the people they will attract.

21:02.780 --> 21:03.780
Okay, great.

21:03.980 --> 21:06.790
What I don't understand is
why are there so many questions here

21:06.860 --> 21:09.340
about past relationships.

21:10.140 --> 21:13.620
Because you learn a lot about someone
from their prior relationships.

21:13.820 --> 21:15.620
You learn patterns. You learn behaviors.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.420
You learn whether or not
they play the victim role.

21:17.740 --> 21:20.980
Do they take full responsibility
for their role in the breakup?

21:21.820 --> 21:24.340
All that from one little sheet of paper?

21:24.900 --> 21:25.940
Yes.

21:29.180 --> 21:30.180
"Hmm" what?

21:31.100 --> 21:34.900
I've never wanted to know
the past of any woman I was ever dating.

21:35.540 --> 21:37.190
Maybe that's why you're single.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.660
Okay.

21:43.860 --> 21:48.900
Last night, I went ahead
and filled out one of these.

21:49.060 --> 21:51.420
Maybe you can tell me
a little something about myself.

21:51.660 --> 21:54.940
Why would you fill this out?
You're not trying to find a date.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.540
I'd like to see how good you are.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.100
Okay.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.180
Well, you are relationship-oriented.

22:06.460 --> 22:07.980
You give a lot in relationships.

22:10.740 --> 22:12.820
You believe in love,

22:13.180 --> 22:16.420
but because you've been hurt a few times,
you've given up on it.

22:16.540 --> 22:17.980
You are passionate.

22:18.740 --> 22:22.900
You look like you got
a little bit of a mean streak, though.

22:23.980 --> 22:26.550
Very attentive. Need a lot of reassurance.

22:26.620 --> 22:28.140
Very observant.

22:35.700 --> 22:38.540
Not bad. Not bad.

22:39.660 --> 22:40.740
So let's continue.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.300
Page two is really interesting.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.300
You need a ride?

22:47.460 --> 22:48.660
No, I'm good.

22:49.220 --> 22:50.790
Can you pass me my purse
underneath there?

22:51.300 --> 22:52.420
Yeah.

22:53.260 --> 22:55.620
Thank you, guys. Good night.

22:55.780 --> 22:57.110
Good night.

23:02.340 --> 23:04.340
Something's wrong with the girl.

23:05.540 --> 23:06.950
What do you mean?

23:07.020 --> 23:10.140
Did you see the way
she covered herself up as she's leaving?

23:17.300 --> 23:18.460
It's chilly.

23:18.540 --> 23:21.380
No, something's wrong with the girl.

23:23.220 --> 23:26.030
What, you don't think
we made the right decision?

23:26.100 --> 23:27.460
I need the help.

23:28.180 --> 23:31.620
But she has to be watched.

23:38.980 --> 23:40.630
Why don't you just take the whole bucket?

23:40.700 --> 23:43.060
I don't want the whole bucket.

24:47.060 --> 24:49.500
<i>Yes! Yes, yes, yes.
Judith, you nailed another one.</i>

24:49.580 --> 24:51.150
<i>I did, didn't I?</i>

24:51.340 --> 24:53.100
<i>All right, come on, let's wrap this up.
I gotta get home.</i>

24:53.180 --> 24:54.180
<i>Okay-</i>

24:54.260 --> 24:56.460
50-50 chance that couple's gonna work.

24:56.700 --> 24:58.700
-50-50?
- Yeah.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.940
Training this computer to think like you.

25:01.140 --> 25:03.980
50-50. 50-50. Let's go.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.020
Come on.

25:09.580 --> 25:12.150
50-50.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.820
Can I get some? Wow.

25:15.460 --> 25:16.460
Okay.

25:16.540 --> 25:17.740
I'm impressed. I'm thoroughly impressed.

25:17.820 --> 25:18.980
My husband's never gonna believe

25:19.060 --> 25:20.180
that I'm helping out with stuff like this.

25:20.260 --> 25:22.580
You were amazing.
How long you guys been married?

25:22.660 --> 25:25.420
Six years. I've known him for 19.

25:26.260 --> 25:27.260
19 years?

25:28.060 --> 25:31.500
Wait, so you're a very old-looking
young woman

25:31.580 --> 25:34.060
or you met him when you were five?

25:34.140 --> 25:35.180
Six.

25:35.260 --> 25:36.750
- Wow.
- Yeah.

25:36.820 --> 25:37.940
So you're 25.

25:38.860 --> 25:40.980
26. In three days.

25:41.660 --> 25:43.070
Happy early birthday.

25:43.540 --> 25:47.220
I never thought I would be
one of those people that dread birthdays,

25:47.700 --> 25:51.620
but it just feels like it's a reminder
that I'm not where I want to be.

25:51.820 --> 25:52.860
Where did you want to be?

25:53.300 --> 25:56.420
I thought by now,
I'd at least have my license.

25:56.620 --> 25:57.980
I'd be a marriage counselor.

25:58.060 --> 26:00.540
I'd be on my way to starting my practice.
You know...

26:00.620 --> 26:01.740
That's very noble, I think.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.620
Marriage counselor,
that's a wonderful career.

26:03.700 --> 26:04.860
You should totally do that.

26:05.100 --> 26:07.860
You're super smart.
Look at what we just did.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.750
Judith... I mean, you're bright.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.470
You're intelligent. You're motivated.

26:12.540 --> 26:16.220
Set up a business plan
and make it happen. Now.

26:22.660 --> 26:24.070
Did I say something wrong?

26:26.300 --> 26:28.180
No, it's actually very encouraging.

26:28.260 --> 26:32.580
And you know I could totally help you
with this marriage counselor thing.

26:34.020 --> 26:36.990
I mean, I have a successful business.
You can ask me anything.

26:38.140 --> 26:40.020
What did you do different
than the rest of us?

26:40.100 --> 26:42.580
Like, how'd you become
so successful so young?

26:43.500 --> 26:45.660
I've always been ambitious.

26:45.860 --> 26:48.510
Very much a workaholic. So...

26:49.220 --> 26:50.710
What does that feel like?

26:59.180 --> 27:00.420
Lonely.

27:01.860 --> 27:05.910
It's kinda sad to be able to buy
whatever you want

27:06.220 --> 27:08.790
and have to beg for what you need.

27:09.620 --> 27:12.100
My last relationship was back in college.

27:12.180 --> 27:16.150
I had met a wonderful woman.

27:17.980 --> 27:21.700
Completely blew my mind
and I fell in love with her.

27:23.780 --> 27:27.500
And she walked out on me

27:30.620 --> 27:33.940
and I haven't really been able to rebound.
Since then.

27:36.420 --> 27:40.060
Since college, huh? That's a long time.

27:41.180 --> 27:43.260
I didn't even know she was unhappy.

27:49.220 --> 27:50.340
Are you happy?

27:54.140 --> 27:55.220
Yeah.

27:56.340 --> 27:57.860
Yeah, very happy-

27:58.780 --> 28:00.380
He's a great guy.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.630
Good for you.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.620
Especially good for him.

28:13.460 --> 28:15.420
He's a very lucky man, Judith.

28:23.860 --> 28:26.140
It's getting late.

28:26.220 --> 28:29.190
Let's finish it tomorrow.

28:40.860 --> 28:45.020
There was something I wanted to bring up
to you about the questionnaire.

28:45.180 --> 28:46.180
Yeah?

28:46.260 --> 28:50.390
I saw the questions about the
relationships, compatibility, the hobbies,

28:50.700 --> 28:53.270
but there are no questions there about sex.

28:54.740 --> 28:55.820
No,no,no.

28:55.940 --> 28:58.590
I don't believe in sex before marriage,
so why would we need that?

28:58.660 --> 28:59.740
Really?

29:00.900 --> 29:01.900
Yes.

29:02.820 --> 29:04.540
Wait a second. Where are you from?

29:04.780 --> 29:05.940
It's not about where I'm from.

29:06.020 --> 29:08.910
It's called I'm a Christian.
I was raised that way.

29:08.980 --> 29:11.140
So what you're saying is your husband

29:11.220 --> 29:14.620
is the only guy you've ever been with. Ever.

29:14.700 --> 29:16.220
- Yes.
- One guy.

29:17.460 --> 29:20.030
Yes, and my husband and I
are very compatible.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.980
How would you know how
sexually compatible you are

29:22.060 --> 29:24.340
when you have nothing to compare it to?

29:27.500 --> 29:31.300
I watch HBO.
I know I'm not missing anything.

29:36.660 --> 29:42.900
I just keep picturing this same old, boring,

29:43.580 --> 29:48.580
turn the lamp off, fluff the pillows,
always in the bedroom kinda thing.

29:50.900 --> 29:52.700
What's wrong with the bedroom?

29:53.900 --> 29:55.580
That's unfortunate.

29:56.540 --> 29:58.110
If you were with another man,

29:59.340 --> 30:01.380
you'd know that sex should be random.

30:01.620 --> 30:02.900
Like animals.

30:04.020 --> 30:05.740
When it happens, it just happens.

30:07.740 --> 30:09.020
In the kitchen.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.420
In the shower.

30:12.500 --> 30:15.070
In the office. On a plane.

30:16.260 --> 30:17.460
On the floor.

30:19.220 --> 30:21.380
Are you getting turned on?

30:23.060 --> 30:25.870
Please. You need to go home.

30:48.220 --> 30:49.380
Hey, babe.

30:52.220 --> 30:53.900
I made you a sandwich.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.260
What's wrong?

30:58.180 --> 30:59.460
Okay. Okay.

31:00.020 --> 31:02.540
- Now, baby, baby, attack me!
- Attack you?

31:02.620 --> 31:04.540
- Yeah. Like an animal.
- Like an animal?

31:04.620 --> 31:05.740
- Yeah, baby!
- Okay.

31:05.860 --> 31:07.060
Just grab my hair!

31:07.140 --> 31:09.100
- Wait, grab your hair?
- Yeah, and growl.

31:12.740 --> 31:13.860
Yes, baby. Come on, open this shirt!

31:13.940 --> 31:15.060
Okay, no. This is my new shirt.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.180
Come on, come on!

31:16.260 --> 31:18.500
- And scratch my back!
- Baby, hey! Hey! Scratch?

31:18.580 --> 31:20.660
Look, this is weird.

31:20.740 --> 31:22.150
We're not gonna do this.

31:22.620 --> 31:24.940
I'm gonna forget you did this, okay?

31:25.260 --> 31:28.150
Now, if you wanna growl at something,
you can growl at this sandwich.

31:28.940 --> 31:32.660
After we finish eating, we can go
in the bedroom and do this the right way.

31:33.180 --> 31:34.220
Okay?

31:36.180 --> 31:37.380
Can I eat?

31:38.060 --> 31:39.180
Thank you.

31:42.540 --> 31:45.110
We could fluff the pillows,
turn off the lamps.

31:45.180 --> 31:47.300
You know, do it the way we always do.

31:47.820 --> 31:50.820
<i>It's going to be a great day
if you're planning on being outdoors.</i>

31:50.900 --> 31:53.380
<i>So if you don't have to be
at work, or even if you do,</i>

31:53.460 --> 31:56.190
<i>make sure you get outside
and enjoy the warm weather.</i>

31:56.260 --> 32:00.940
<i>As we are experiencing some
really nice above seasonal weather.</i>

32:01.660 --> 32:06.620
<i>You can expect sunny highs in the mid-70s
and it could reach even as high as 78.</i>

32:06.820 --> 32:09.060
<i>Northwest winds
are around five miles per hour,</i>

32:09.300 --> 32:11.380
<i>becoming westerly in the afternoon.</i>

32:11.580 --> 32:14.580
<i>Now, this high pressure
is moving in from the southwest</i>

32:14.660 --> 32:18.660
<i>and it should be expected
to stay with us for the next couple of days.</i>

32:24.780 --> 32:25.820
Good morning.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.900
- Morning.
- How are you?

32:29.540 --> 32:30.900
Good.

32:32.220 --> 32:34.420
You knocked me out last night.

32:34.500 --> 32:35.660
I know.

32:36.380 --> 32:39.350
I didn't do my job too well,
if you're already up and running.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.540
Just going for a Saturday morning run.
See you later.

33:10.860 --> 33:12.460
Imagine me running into you.

33:12.540 --> 33:15.220
What did you say?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

33:28.860 --> 33:29.900
What?

33:30.580 --> 33:31.860
What?

33:32.060 --> 33:33.820
That's the trash-talking. That's what I hear.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.860
I'm pacing myself.

33:35.940 --> 33:37.700
Well, who's leaving who in the dust?

33:37.780 --> 33:39.940
Hey, watch out, watch out!

33:40.180 --> 33:41.620
I'm so sorry. You okay?

33:41.820 --> 33:44.260
- What is your problem, man?
- I didn't see you.

33:44.460 --> 33:45.980
Say something!
You gonna knock her down like that?

33:46.060 --> 33:47.220
You'll hurt him. Harley, wait, wait!

33:47.420 --> 33:48.750
No, Harley. No.

33:48.940 --> 33:50.980
- Harley, I'm okay.
- Please! I'm really sorry.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.860
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

33:53.060 --> 33:55.060
Just let him go. Just walk away.

33:55.420 --> 33:59.220
I'm okay. Okay? I'm fine. I'm fine.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.300
I'm okay. No, I'm okay.

34:02.060 --> 34:03.340
Let's get you up here.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.260
- Wait, wait, wait.
- That's good.

34:05.340 --> 34:06.380
Let me go slow.

34:06.820 --> 34:07.900
Wait, wait.

34:07.980 --> 34:10.100
- Okay. All right, okay, this could be bad.
- Wait, wait, wait.

34:10.180 --> 34:11.180
Let me call my husband.

34:11.380 --> 34:12.420
No, I live close by here.

34:12.500 --> 34:13.540
No,no,no.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.340
No, I'll wrap it up,
I'll call my neighbor, he's a doctor.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.860
Okay, all right,
but I still have to call, because...

34:16.940 --> 34:18.540
No, either way, we gotta get your leg...

34:18.620 --> 34:21.620
- No, no, no! Put me back down.
- No, listen! Hey!

34:21.900 --> 34:25.140
I got you. Okay? All right.

34:36.580 --> 34:37.740
You good?

34:37.820 --> 34:38.900
Yeah.

34:39.140 --> 34:41.740
Wow, this, this place is just incredible.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.100
Thank you.

34:47.780 --> 34:50.980
So he's not answering.

34:51.580 --> 34:53.340
You know, it's actually feeling better.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.580
Well, it's not swelling. That's a good thing.

34:54.660 --> 34:55.900
I have to just walk it off.

34:55.980 --> 34:57.060
No, let me see.

34:57.300 --> 34:59.340
Just let me see it.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.500
Hold on.

35:02.620 --> 35:03.740
I don't know if I need all of that.

35:03.820 --> 35:06.140
Just hold on one quick second.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.660
Well, you're pretty good at it.

35:13.260 --> 35:17.820
Yeah, it's just a little something
I picked up in college.

35:18.180 --> 35:20.020
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

35:20.140 --> 35:21.740
So was my husband.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.140
Has a bunch of basketball injuries.

35:25.260 --> 35:26.260
Really?

35:30.180 --> 35:31.780
You talk about him a lot.

35:33.860 --> 35:36.380
It's kinda what you do when you're married.

35:36.940 --> 35:41.150
When he comes up,
it's kinda in comparison to me.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.740
No, it's not.

35:46.300 --> 35:48.140
Yeah, it actually is.

35:48.620 --> 35:51.740
You wouldn't be comparing us, would you?

35:53.180 --> 35:54.380
Why would I do that?

35:55.060 --> 35:56.340
Well, you tell me.

35:57.460 --> 35:59.700
Okay, my husband is not up for discussion.

35:59.980 --> 36:02.220
- Well, you bring him up a lot.
- No, I do not.

36:06.340 --> 36:08.220
Okay. I'm sorry.

36:08.460 --> 36:12.740
I shouldn't have said anything about...

36:14.980 --> 36:17.260
Look, it's just that,

36:19.140 --> 36:20.820
on one hand,

36:21.420 --> 36:23.420
I really wonder who this guy is.

36:23.780 --> 36:27.140
And how special he must be
to have gotten you.

36:27.740 --> 36:30.660
And on the other hand,
I wonder, does he even know it.

36:32.660 --> 36:35.260
I wonder if he challenges you mentally.

36:35.700 --> 36:37.940
Does he bring out the best in you?

36:38.700 --> 36:40.580
Does he even notice you anymore?

36:40.660 --> 36:42.940
- You know what? I'm not...
- Judith, listen.

36:43.020 --> 36:44.380
Just listen.

36:45.380 --> 36:48.420
If I had a woman as beautiful as you,

36:49.420 --> 36:51.100
I wouldn't miss a thing.

36:53.340 --> 36:58.630
Like the small blonde hairs
on the back of your neck.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.620
Or how

37:03.380 --> 37:06.300
your left temple throbs
when you're in deep thought.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.100
How

37:09.940 --> 37:13.380
calm you get when you're really excited.

37:14.620 --> 37:15.620
Like right now.

37:18.780 --> 37:22.620
That is very sexy.
How slow you're breathing.

37:31.020 --> 37:32.900
Well, I don't miss anything either.

37:34.820 --> 37:39.860
Like the smell of jasmine perfume
on this sofa that's obviously fresh.

37:40.820 --> 37:44.500
Or those pair of high heels in your bedroom.

37:45.620 --> 37:47.900
Those diamond earrings
on this coffee table.

37:52.540 --> 37:54.190
Don't play with me, Harley.

37:56.980 --> 37:59.060
Verbal sparring.

38:00.540 --> 38:02.190
You know that's a sign I'm winning.

38:02.980 --> 38:04.390
Winning what?

38:07.540 --> 38:09.220
That must be Brice at the door.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.340
- Brice? Your husband?
- Yeah.

38:12.460 --> 38:14.740
I can't wait to meet this guy.

38:14.820 --> 38:17.020
- Here, let me help.
- I can walk by myself.

38:17.100 --> 38:18.540
I'm gonna help you, okay?

38:19.860 --> 38:20.860
Here we go.

38:20.940 --> 38:24.020
- See, I'm good.
- All right.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.380
It's fine. Okay?

38:25.500 --> 38:26.700
Hey, be careful.

38:30.460 --> 38:32.940
- Hey! You must be Brice, right?
- Yeah.

38:33.340 --> 38:34.670
Harley. Nice to meet you, man.

38:35.780 --> 38:36.820
Hey, babe, what happened?

38:37.060 --> 38:39.220
I fell down when I was running.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.540
Harley helped me out, though.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.460
- Thank you.
- No problem.

38:43.660 --> 38:46.180
Thanks a lot, Harley, I'll see you later.

38:46.860 --> 38:48.460
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

38:49.100 --> 38:51.060
Likewise. Thanks again.

38:51.540 --> 38:52.740
It's, you know, it's just...

39:00.060 --> 39:02.020
- Good morning.
- Morning.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.660
Babe, I was thinking.

39:03.740 --> 39:05.700
Were you and Harley running together?

39:06.900 --> 39:09.580
No, he just happened to be in the park.

39:10.580 --> 39:11.660
Okay.

39:12.780 --> 39:13.900
You look nice.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.100
Thank you.

39:16.420 --> 39:20.340
I'll be late tonight.
It's that mid-month inventory.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.940
I hate the 15th.

39:24.660 --> 39:27.860
Yeah. Your breakfast is on the table.

39:28.060 --> 39:29.100
All right.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.350
Do I have any calls?

39:46.420 --> 39:47.460
Flowers!

39:47.540 --> 39:49.140
Susan, do I have any messages?

39:49.260 --> 39:51.460
I didn't know the 15th was your birthday.

39:51.620 --> 39:53.420
Happy birthday. Here you go.

39:56.100 --> 39:58.140
Hey, he remembered!

40:02.700 --> 40:04.700
I left the apartment this morning so mad.

40:04.940 --> 40:08.100
I thought my husband forgot my birthday.
But he didn't!

40:08.300 --> 40:11.620
You are so excited about him. That is great.

40:15.180 --> 40:18.070
Did you try something new? With your hair?

40:18.140 --> 40:20.980
I sure did! I curled it.

40:21.060 --> 40:23.220
And you see that green comb?
Right there in my hair?

40:23.300 --> 40:24.950
Unfortunately, I do.

40:25.140 --> 40:27.820
Is your fashion icon a Delta stewardess?

40:27.900 --> 40:28.940
That's what you look like.

40:29.140 --> 40:31.020
Oh, Ava.

40:31.100 --> 40:32.620
- Is this wool?
- Yes.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.900
-It's making me itch.
-It's a blend.

40:34.980 --> 40:36.140
A blend of what?

40:36.220 --> 40:38.620
Ava, can you just give me a break?
It's my birthday.

40:38.980 --> 40:41.020
I tried to do something pretty with my hair.

40:41.180 --> 40:43.780
I have these beautiful flowers
from my husband.

40:44.020 --> 40:45.100
I'm smiling.

40:45.180 --> 40:48.660
- Just give me a compliment or something.
- That was a compliment.

40:51.340 --> 40:53.260
He's on his way up. Come on, we gotta go.

40:54.300 --> 40:56.340
- Who? My husband?
- No, Harley.

40:56.460 --> 40:58.180
Come on, we really gotta fix this.

40:58.420 --> 41:00.420
- Is that spit?
- Watch my manicure!

41:00.660 --> 41:03.700
- Why are you putting spit in my hair?
- I'm trying to be your friend here, Judith.

41:05.980 --> 41:09.900
When people look at you
it reflects bad on me.

41:10.020 --> 41:11.380
They don't think
you have a mirror or a friend.

41:11.460 --> 41:12.700
And they know we're friends.

41:13.020 --> 41:14.860
My friends don't look like this.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.380
They look like this.

41:16.660 --> 41:20.380
Ava, I think I look really pretty today.

41:20.540 --> 41:23.350
I tried. I put on a little extra makeup.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.500
That's not makeup. That's make down.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.380
I'm matching today, too.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.300
You know, you told me about that.

41:29.380 --> 41:30.900
So you see this gold belt?

41:31.140 --> 41:33.660
The gold belt goes with
the gold flappy things on my shoes.

41:33.900 --> 41:36.380
And the blue shoes go with the blue dress.

41:37.900 --> 41:40.260
Oh, my God!

41:40.820 --> 41:41.900
What?

41:43.980 --> 41:45.700
You're wearing flats?

41:46.020 --> 41:48.860
My foot's all... It hurts a little bit.

41:49.060 --> 41:51.140
Push me out of the window, why don't you?

41:51.540 --> 41:53.300
I would love to.

41:56.540 --> 41:58.540
Harley's here. Come on, we gotta go.

41:58.740 --> 42:00.230
Enough with the coffee. No coffee breath.

42:00.420 --> 42:02.860
Come on. No, no. Nope.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.180
We gotta go.

42:06.340 --> 42:07.580
Hi, Harley.

42:12.500 --> 42:13.540
Hey-

42:13.860 --> 42:14.900
Hey there.

42:15.060 --> 42:16.100
How's your foot?

42:16.340 --> 42:18.060
It's fine. Thanks.

42:18.700 --> 42:20.110
Thanks for helping out the other day, too.

42:20.340 --> 42:21.340
Yeah, no problem.

42:21.780 --> 42:24.220
Brice just couldn't believe
you were so nice to me.

42:24.460 --> 42:26.140
He wanted me to thank you for that.

42:26.420 --> 42:28.460
Yeah, no worries. You changed your hair!

42:30.700 --> 42:31.900
Little bit.

42:32.180 --> 42:33.460
I like it.

42:34.460 --> 42:35.790
Thank you.

42:36.780 --> 42:38.110
Happy birthday.

42:39.100 --> 42:40.460
Thank you.

42:40.780 --> 42:42.140
You like the flowers?

42:46.300 --> 42:47.580
You sent these?

42:48.260 --> 42:50.460
Yeah. Don't look so disappointed.

42:52.060 --> 42:54.140
No, it's just...

42:54.380 --> 42:55.820
lt just said "Happy birthday, Judith."

42:55.940 --> 42:57.780
It didn't say who it was from.

42:57.980 --> 42:59.390
No, I wanted to tell you in person.

42:59.460 --> 43:01.500
I was gonna deliver them myself
when I came up,

43:01.580 --> 43:04.060
but I just didn't really think
that was a good idea.

43:05.140 --> 43:07.900
Yeah. Smart man.

43:08.580 --> 43:09.580
Yes.

43:09.660 --> 43:12.980
Okay. Come here for a second.
Let's sit down.

43:16.220 --> 43:18.340
- Have a seat.
- All right.

43:19.820 --> 43:22.550
Harley, I'm gonna be as honest as I can be.

43:23.060 --> 43:24.580
What's going on?

43:25.820 --> 43:27.820
You have plenty of programmers,

43:28.100 --> 43:31.180
plenty of employees that could
come and help me with this project.

43:31.340 --> 43:33.340
And yet you're coming here every day.

43:34.220 --> 43:35.260
Why?

43:35.740 --> 43:39.580
Judith, I find you extremely beautiful, okay?

43:39.820 --> 43:45.860
And interesting. And if I have to
come here myself to be around you, I will.

43:46.020 --> 43:48.940
I just wanna be involved with you.
Intimately.

43:49.700 --> 43:52.780
And as long as you know
that I'm very married...

43:55.260 --> 43:56.500
Point taken.

43:57.580 --> 43:58.780
He loves you.

44:00.020 --> 44:01.780
I saw that when he picked you up.

44:02.860 --> 44:05.060
He's kinda regular. But lucky.

44:06.220 --> 44:08.380
You just don't impress me
as the type of person

44:08.460 --> 44:10.700
that would be satisfied with a man like that.

44:11.980 --> 44:14.340
Maybe at one point in time, in your life.

44:15.060 --> 44:16.900
But where you're going,

44:17.420 --> 44:19.070
I just don't see that lasting.

44:27.380 --> 44:28.740
You don't know him.

44:43.700 --> 44:45.500
- Hi.
- Hey.

44:46.220 --> 44:47.740
Crazy day today.

44:47.900 --> 44:48.900
Yeah?

44:50.620 --> 44:51.620
Yeah.

44:52.420 --> 44:54.940
I was trying to finish up all that inventory.

45:16.780 --> 45:18.430
Babe, I'm sorry.

45:23.580 --> 45:26.100
It's the second year in a row, Brice.

45:27.700 --> 45:30.620
Babe, I just got a little carried away
with work, that's all.

45:32.180 --> 45:35.220
Yeah. I understand. It's all good.

45:35.980 --> 45:38.300
No, no, let me take you out or something.

45:38.460 --> 45:44.580
No. I have this really big assignment
for work and I got a lot to do.

45:46.260 --> 45:47.830
Babe, I'm sorry.

45:49.540 --> 45:51.220
Brice, it's okay.

45:52.620 --> 45:53.980
Don't worry about it.

46:26.220 --> 46:28.700
<i>She may be weary</i>

46:30.540 --> 46:33.380
<i>Them young girls
They do get weary</i>

46:34.260 --> 46:39.630
<i>Wearing that
same old shaggy dress</i>

46:40.020 --> 46:41.020
<i>Yeah</i>

46:44.860 --> 46:47.540
<i>But when she gets weary</i>

46:49.940 --> 46:54.460
<i>Try a little tenderness</i>

46:54.540 --> 46:55.870
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

46:57.340 --> 46:58.420
<i>Oh, now, now</i>

47:01.940 --> 47:04.420
<i>You won't regret it
No, no</i>

47:06.540 --> 47:08.460
<i>Young girls
They don't forget it</i>

47:09.180 --> 47:14.660
<i>Love is their own happiness</i>

47:14.740 --> 47:16.340
You're silly.

47:19.780 --> 47:22.900
<i>But it's all so easy</i>

47:24.380 --> 47:26.140
<i>All you gotta do is try</i>

47:26.740 --> 47:30.060
<i>Try a little tenderness</i>

47:31.060 --> 47:34.540
<i>All you got to do is, man</i>

47:34.620 --> 47:36.700
<i>Hold her when you wanna</i>

47:38.060 --> 47:39.660
Happy birthday, baby.

47:40.460 --> 47:41.950
I'm sorry.

47:50.580 --> 47:53.780
All right, girls,
let's make some dreams happen.

47:55.420 --> 48:00.100
Judith, you have been requested
to accompany Harley

48:00.180 --> 48:01.780
to New Orleans for a meeting.

48:02.700 --> 48:03.700
Really?

48:03.780 --> 48:05.940
Yes. He's presenting to his shareholders

48:06.020 --> 48:07.780
and he wants you there.

48:09.460 --> 48:10.870
Okay, well, when do we leave?

48:10.940 --> 48:13.300
Oh, no, darling, just you.

48:13.620 --> 48:15.270
I think he likes you.

48:15.740 --> 48:20.140
Now, I know you're married,
but just flirt a little.

48:20.300 --> 48:22.780
Get the deal closed.
Don't compromise yourself.

48:23.060 --> 48:25.140
But just flirt.

48:26.980 --> 48:28.100
I understand.

48:28.980 --> 48:30.500
I know I don't know you very well,

48:30.580 --> 48:33.550
but I want you to know
exactly what you're getting yourself into.

48:36.380 --> 48:38.620
This is a big deal for me and this place.

48:38.820 --> 48:41.260
And I want it in the worst way.

48:42.100 --> 48:43.340
That being said,

48:44.060 --> 48:47.420
I will tell you like I tell all my girls
who go out with my guys.

48:48.180 --> 48:51.820
Be nice. Be aware. Have fun.

48:52.660 --> 48:55.310
But most of all, be careful.

48:56.820 --> 48:58.340
I know you're a smart girl,

48:59.180 --> 49:01.180
but this is another league you're in.

49:03.860 --> 49:05.140
Trust me.

49:17.980 --> 49:20.950
<i>A couple of senatorial retirement
announcements this week,</i>

49:21.020 --> 49:25.020
<i>highlighting what has been
a gradual rolling back of the GOP's...</i>

49:25.260 --> 49:26.700
Hello. Can I help you?

49:26.940 --> 49:30.100
Hi. Do you think you can tell me
how to get to Johnson Jewelry?

49:30.180 --> 49:32.620
I'm a little turned around.
I'm kind of new in town.

49:32.700 --> 49:34.860
You want East Jefferson.

49:34.940 --> 49:37.020
This is West Jefferson.

49:37.300 --> 49:38.870
That's on the other side of town.

49:38.980 --> 49:40.140
Thank you. Thank you so much.

50:03.300 --> 50:05.620
What? We're back to this again?

50:05.700 --> 50:07.540
Did you not have
a good birthday or something?

50:10.380 --> 50:12.060
My husband forgot.

50:13.220 --> 50:16.060
He forgot?
I thought he sent you flowers yesterday.

50:17.580 --> 50:19.380
No, they weren't from him.

50:20.260 --> 50:21.910
He didn't even remember.

50:22.820 --> 50:27.260
I mean, he tried.
It's just the second year in a row.

50:27.940 --> 50:29.270
You are forgettable.

50:29.820 --> 50:32.820
Honey, you have to make
a man remember you.

50:33.100 --> 50:35.670
I've tried to give you my assistance,
but you don't want it,

50:35.780 --> 50:37.020
so get out.

50:38.580 --> 50:40.230
All right, you win.

50:43.060 --> 50:44.260
Win what?

50:45.460 --> 50:48.540
The hair, the makeup, the clothes.

50:49.020 --> 50:50.540
Do whatever you wanna do.

50:51.180 --> 50:53.540
Are you kidding? Oh, my God. Thank you.

50:53.620 --> 50:56.460
I have been dying
to get my hands on this hair.

50:56.620 --> 50:57.740
Come on. Come on.

51:11.980 --> 51:15.380
Look. Look at the bags,
the shoes, purses, everything.

51:15.460 --> 51:17.380
I dream of this room.

51:17.580 --> 51:18.780
Look at this.

51:18.980 --> 51:20.060
Where are we right now?

51:20.260 --> 51:23.070
This is the place that Janice
sends the girls that she's not happy with

51:23.140 --> 51:24.300
before, you know, she sets them up.

51:24.460 --> 51:27.820
So this is what I call Couture Heaven.

51:28.060 --> 51:29.470
All right, let's get started.

51:29.900 --> 51:30.980
Wow.

51:31.060 --> 51:32.900
There's so much to do with you
in so little time.

51:33.100 --> 51:34.620
What do you think of this?

51:35.820 --> 51:37.580
Wow. What kind of fabric is this?

51:37.780 --> 51:40.670
One that's never been on your back.
It's called expensive.

51:42.580 --> 51:44.180
Good morning. Good morning.

51:46.900 --> 51:47.900
What's wrong?

51:48.500 --> 51:51.390
Her ex came in here. Tell him, honey.

51:52.660 --> 51:54.660
I've been hiding from him.

51:55.340 --> 51:57.220
Running from him for years.

51:58.820 --> 52:02.060
Changed my name. I moved here and...

52:02.780 --> 52:04.460
I can't believe he's here.

52:08.300 --> 52:09.870
I'm gonna have to quit.

52:10.180 --> 52:11.860
Well, where are you gonna go?

52:12.980 --> 52:14.100
I don't know.

52:17.100 --> 52:18.590
I'm tired of starting over.

52:18.820 --> 52:21.220
Look, maybe he just
stumbled in here on accident.

52:21.540 --> 52:23.380
Do you know how many people
live in this city?

52:23.980 --> 52:27.540
You can't keep running
from someone your whole life.

52:28.940 --> 52:30.540
You don't understand.

52:32.140 --> 52:35.180
When we first met, he wined and dined me.

52:36.300 --> 52:39.900
Made me feel like I was
the luckiest woman in the world.

52:43.140 --> 52:47.700
Then things started to unravel.

52:50.580 --> 52:52.740
And I don't know if it was the drugs

52:53.100 --> 52:55.580
or if he was really mentally ill.

52:56.500 --> 52:58.620
He just started to change.

52:59.180 --> 53:02.540
And just became evil.

53:06.820 --> 53:08.780
Like he was two different people.

53:17.020 --> 53:18.220
He tried to kill me.

53:21.820 --> 53:24.020
I just can't see you
being with a guy like that.

53:25.260 --> 53:27.910
Sometimes you never know
who you're married to.

53:28.940 --> 53:33.020
People start off one way
and end up somebody else.

53:33.420 --> 53:36.020
One night, he was on that couch...

53:36.220 --> 53:39.190
I ran and I never looked back after that.

53:40.980 --> 53:43.180
Look, Melinda, you can't quit.

53:43.300 --> 53:44.790
What am I supposed to do?

53:45.580 --> 53:46.620
We'll help you.

53:47.860 --> 53:50.300
We'll pick you up and drop you off.

53:51.700 --> 53:52.740
We?

53:53.300 --> 53:54.460
Miss Waco.

53:54.860 --> 53:55.900
What?

53:56.300 --> 53:57.380
I'll help you.

53:57.740 --> 54:00.020
Yeah, he'll protect you.

54:00.300 --> 54:02.100
Don't throw away what you found here.

54:02.980 --> 54:05.060
Do you know what we all need?

54:06.580 --> 54:07.990
Is a Valium.

54:10.500 --> 54:13.540
I have a whole room full of them.

54:44.100 --> 54:45.140
Good morning.

54:45.340 --> 54:46.500
Thank you.

54:49.940 --> 54:51.460
Please watch your step.

55:02.180 --> 55:03.340
Hello.

55:04.820 --> 55:05.860
Hi.

55:06.820 --> 55:11.220
You gonna fly standing up
or you gonna have a seat?

55:13.460 --> 55:16.190
Yeah. Right. I Will.

55:19.220 --> 55:20.300
All right.

55:20.380 --> 55:23.980
So, is this your plane? Like, it all is?

55:24.180 --> 55:26.060
- Like, all the parts and everything.
- Yeah.

55:26.940 --> 55:28.940
Wow. That's cool.

55:29.020 --> 55:30.620
You know, I was thinkin'.
When we leave New Orleans,

55:30.740 --> 55:34.020
maybe we can head over to Paris.
Or New York.

55:34.220 --> 55:35.820
All this work we're trying to focus on

55:35.900 --> 55:37.260
and you're talking about
Paris and New York?

55:37.900 --> 55:41.220
If you were mine, you wouldn't have to work.

55:43.740 --> 55:45.900
If you were mine,
you wouldn't be on this plane right now.

55:46.060 --> 55:47.420
Your butt would be at a pharmacy.

55:47.660 --> 55:48.860
That's the handout for the board meeting.

55:49.900 --> 55:51.060
Champagne, sir?

55:53.220 --> 55:54.260
Thank you.

55:54.340 --> 55:55.420
You're welcome.

55:55.540 --> 55:57.110
- Something for you?
- Thanks, I'm fine.

57:32.180 --> 57:33.590
Look at you.

57:35.100 --> 57:37.500
Champagne. Private jet.

57:40.020 --> 57:42.780
You look amazing, by the way.

57:44.020 --> 57:46.830
Man, this view is just incredible.

57:53.540 --> 57:54.700
What?

57:57.300 --> 57:59.300
It's just refreshing to see someone

57:59.380 --> 58:01.300
experience this side of life for the first time.

58:01.380 --> 58:03.700
You know? it is. it excites me.

58:04.380 --> 58:05.380
Whatever.

58:05.500 --> 58:09.780
You know you take people on this plane
all the time and excite them.

58:10.060 --> 58:12.740
Just my ex.

58:14.180 --> 58:16.580
This was no big deal for her.

58:21.220 --> 58:24.260
I really hate being taken for granted.

58:25.220 --> 58:26.340
Don't you?

58:28.700 --> 58:29.900
Yeah.

58:34.420 --> 58:36.900
How would that make you feel
when she would do that?

58:38.260 --> 58:40.910
The opposite of how this makes you feel.

58:43.300 --> 58:45.300
How does this make me feel?

58:49.660 --> 58:51.020
Special.

58:52.380 --> 58:53.710
Important.

58:55.380 --> 58:56.740
Wanted.

58:59.940 --> 59:01.180
Am I right?

59:03.940 --> 59:06.020
You should feel that way all the time.

59:06.220 --> 59:07.740
This stuff didn't matter to her.

59:08.380 --> 59:11.110
The more I tried,
the more she shot me down.

59:14.460 --> 59:16.300
I think I just love too hard.

59:17.380 --> 59:19.100
I do. I fall.

59:20.300 --> 59:23.580
Before I know it, I'm just... I'm gone.

59:25.460 --> 59:26.660
What do you mean, "gone"?

59:27.140 --> 59:29.580
Just crazy.

59:29.780 --> 59:33.990
Crazy in love. You know?

59:34.140 --> 59:37.620
So I've learned to keep
my true feelings inside

59:37.820 --> 59:41.460
because most women
can't handle the kind of emotion that I bring.

59:43.140 --> 59:44.380
What does that mean?

59:45.140 --> 59:46.940
Well, I can come on really strong.

59:48.660 --> 59:50.100
How so?

59:51.980 --> 59:54.820
I want to make love to you. Right now.

59:59.820 --> 1:00:01.820
That's the kind of thing I'd say to her.

1:00:05.140 --> 1:00:07.460
You are so beautiful.

1:00:09.900 --> 1:00:11.140
Thank you.

1:00:19.180 --> 1:00:20.260
What?

1:00:20.340 --> 1:00:21.940
I was talking about my ex.

1:00:22.180 --> 1:00:25.740
But you are beautiful, though. You are.

1:00:27.420 --> 1:00:28.540
You are.

1:00:29.180 --> 1:00:30.340
Thank you.

1:00:31.820 --> 1:00:34.470
One compliment does deserve another.

1:00:38.660 --> 1:00:43.300
I think we are better off
just keeping it professional.

1:00:43.820 --> 1:00:45.420
You know we're way past that.

1:00:48.700 --> 1:00:51.380
I find myself very attracted to you.

1:00:53.540 --> 1:00:56.060
I find myself very married.

1:00:57.860 --> 1:01:01.500
Happily married, right?

1:01:06.340 --> 1:01:07.910
A guy can dream, right?

1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:13.740
I can't stop you from dreaming.

1:01:15.740 --> 1:01:17.230
What do you dream about?

1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:31.100
I used to dream about helping people
and starting my own practice.

1:01:31.220 --> 1:01:33.580
But I graduated college and reality hit.

1:01:34.740 --> 1:01:36.740
I don't really dream anymore.

1:01:38.700 --> 1:01:40.940
You know all that could easily be reality.

1:01:45.580 --> 1:01:47.180
What do you dream about?

1:01:49.180 --> 1:01:50.260
You.

1:01:56.780 --> 1:01:58.460
You ever dream about me?

1:02:02.380 --> 1:02:03.790
I have a husband.

1:02:05.540 --> 1:02:07.300
Yeah. I know.

1:02:10.100 --> 1:02:11.140
Do you want me?

1:02:27.420 --> 1:02:28.940
What are you doing?

1:02:30.140 --> 1:02:31.470
Harley, stop it.

1:02:31.860 --> 1:02:32.900
I don't want to.

1:02:33.620 --> 1:02:34.820
Harley, stop it.

1:02:35.140 --> 1:02:36.380
Please, Harley.

1:02:37.140 --> 1:02:38.740
Please. Stop.

1:02:40.140 --> 1:02:42.660
Get off of me. Get off of me!

1:02:42.900 --> 1:02:46.980
Get! Get off of me!

1:02:47.340 --> 1:02:48.420
Just stop!

1:02:48.820 --> 1:02:49.820
Stop it. Stop.

1:02:49.900 --> 1:02:50.900
- You stop.
- Stop it.

1:02:52.900 --> 1:02:54.780
Now you can say you resisted.

1:03:35.100 --> 1:03:36.100
Are you okay?

1:03:37.860 --> 1:03:39.820
I don't wanna ever see you again.

1:03:40.540 --> 1:03:42.980
If you need anything, Janice can help you.

1:03:43.460 --> 1:03:45.030
Okay, Judith, hold on a second, please.

1:03:45.100 --> 1:03:46.900
- I will not do this. I can't.
- Wait.

1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:48.100
Judith, are you sure about this?

1:03:48.180 --> 1:03:49.140
- Wait a second.
- I mean it.

1:03:49.220 --> 1:03:52.500
Wait, wait.
Let me talk to you real quick. Hold on.

1:03:53.980 --> 1:03:56.220
Are you sure you want to do this? Really?

1:03:57.700 --> 1:03:59.380
- Thank you, son.
- No problem.

1:04:00.300 --> 1:04:01.300
Judith.

1:04:02.300 --> 1:04:03.420
Hey-

1:04:08.340 --> 1:04:11.340
Harley, you remember my husband, Brice.

1:04:11.420 --> 1:04:12.540
Hey, how you doin', man?

1:04:13.660 --> 1:04:14.700
Hi.

1:04:15.420 --> 1:04:16.860
That is a beautiful car.

1:04:17.540 --> 1:04:18.540
Thank you.

1:04:21.940 --> 1:04:22.940
Hey, Mama.

1:04:23.580 --> 1:04:24.580
This your mother?

1:04:27.260 --> 1:04:28.260
Harley.

1:04:30.420 --> 1:04:32.070
Reverend Sarah Ogalvee.

1:04:32.140 --> 1:04:33.140
It's a pleasure.

1:04:35.140 --> 1:04:38.420
Thanks so much for the ride, Harley.
Appreciate that.

1:04:40.140 --> 1:04:41.380
Okay. Y'all have a good night.

1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:42.860
Yeah. Let's get you in, Miss Sarah.

1:04:42.940 --> 1:04:43.940
All right, son.

1:04:44.620 --> 1:04:45.620
Hi, Mom.

1:04:45.780 --> 1:04:47.860
Sweetheart, how you doin'?

1:04:47.940 --> 1:04:50.300
- You made it, huh?
- So happy to see you.

1:05:53.500 --> 1:05:57.420
Sweetness, that was an awfully pretty dress
I saw you in earlier.

1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:02.140
- Yeah, you looked nice, babe.
- Thanks.

1:06:02.220 --> 1:06:03.940
My boss gave it to me.

1:06:04.020 --> 1:06:06.100
She wants us to start dressing like that.

1:06:08.540 --> 1:06:09.980
You're not gonna say grace?

1:06:13.180 --> 1:06:15.020
Okay, yeah.

1:06:16.100 --> 1:06:17.380
God, thank you for this food.

1:06:17.660 --> 1:06:19.900
Bless it and purify it.
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

1:06:20.460 --> 1:06:24.620
In Jesus' name we pray.
And we thank you, Lord. Amen.

1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:25.700
Amen.

1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:28.340
Miss Sarah, I'm always happy
when you're around.

1:06:28.540 --> 1:06:29.780
I get to have a home-cooked meal.

1:06:29.900 --> 1:06:31.860
Daughter, you not cooking
for your husband?

1:06:35.140 --> 1:06:36.380
Yes, I am.

1:06:38.900 --> 1:06:42.140
Well, she does, but lately,
she's been working a lot.

1:06:42.220 --> 1:06:45.380
Right. With the man in the red, fast car?

1:06:46.180 --> 1:06:48.910
No. I mean, I don't work with him that often.

1:06:49.060 --> 1:06:50.740
And you know, he's a nice guy.

1:06:50.860 --> 1:06:51.900
Nice guy?

1:06:52.420 --> 1:06:54.540
That don't mean nothin'
if he don't know the Lord.

1:06:56.340 --> 1:06:59.940
"It's easier for a camel
to enter into the eye of a needle

1:07:00.020 --> 1:07:04.740
"than it is for a rich man
to enter into the kingdom of heaven."

1:07:05.900 --> 1:07:08.710
Yes, Mama, I know. You say that a lot.

1:07:09.100 --> 1:07:12.380
But there's nothing wrong
with being rich or having nice things.

1:07:12.740 --> 1:07:15.100
Long as nice things don't have you.

1:07:15.580 --> 1:07:16.580
Amen.

1:07:17.180 --> 1:07:19.020
Well, our business is over anyway, so...

1:07:19.100 --> 1:07:20.700
Well, then that's good, isn't it?

1:07:21.700 --> 1:07:22.900
Yeah.

1:07:24.260 --> 1:07:28.940
You know, baby, it's been a long time
since you been to the house of the Lord.

1:07:32.780 --> 1:07:35.620
I told her we rest on Sundays.

1:07:39.540 --> 1:07:42.430
You know, with your job,
you need to be in church.

1:07:42.500 --> 1:07:45.820
Could build spiritual strength up
to deal with those demons, girl.

1:07:47.540 --> 1:07:49.060
I don't work with demons.

1:07:49.460 --> 1:07:51.500
Isn't that what you said to me on the phone?

1:07:52.780 --> 1:07:54.140
I know, but...

1:07:54.260 --> 1:07:56.180
Okay, I guess I was wrong.

1:07:56.460 --> 1:07:58.380
Mama, not everybody's a demon.

1:07:58.620 --> 1:08:00.460
Well, I know that.

1:08:00.980 --> 1:08:02.900
I'm just voicing my concern.

1:08:03.300 --> 1:08:05.100
We don't talk anymore.

1:08:05.900 --> 1:08:08.380
You don't call in for your morning prayers.

1:08:10.300 --> 1:08:13.110
Well, it's just I get up so early.

1:08:13.180 --> 1:08:15.540
You know, I have to take
the bus every morning.

1:08:15.940 --> 1:08:17.220
At 9:00 a.m.

1:08:17.780 --> 1:08:20.670
Prayer starts at 6:00 a.m. every morning.

1:08:20.860 --> 1:08:22.700
All the sisters be on the line.

1:08:23.220 --> 1:08:26.420
I know you busy, baby.
I know that, but you could call in sometime.

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:27.500
Just once in a while.

1:08:27.580 --> 1:08:29.620
All right, I will. I will. How long you staying?

1:08:32.300 --> 1:08:35.190
I done got on your nerves.
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

1:08:35.260 --> 1:08:37.500
You're not bothering me. It's fine.

1:08:37.580 --> 1:08:39.180
I'm just gonna go dry my hair.

1:08:40.540 --> 1:08:41.660
Everything all right, sweetness?

1:08:41.780 --> 1:08:43.780
Yeah. I just don't wanna catch a cold.

1:08:46.220 --> 1:08:48.900
That's not like her not to want her food.

1:08:49.540 --> 1:08:52.060
Yeah, I think she's mad at me, Miss Sarah.

1:08:52.540 --> 1:08:55.060
I forgot her birthday
and now I'm talking about her cooking.

1:08:55.740 --> 1:08:57.580
How you goin' forget her birthday?

1:09:00.180 --> 1:09:02.100
You need your ass whipped.

1:09:02.340 --> 1:09:04.180
Miss Sarah,
you ain't supposed to be cursin'.

1:09:04.380 --> 1:09:06.460
That's the King James Version.

1:09:08.140 --> 1:09:09.860
It's all right, honey. Eat your food.

1:09:21.700 --> 1:09:22.860
You all right?

1:09:23.420 --> 1:09:24.910
I can't believe you.

1:09:25.700 --> 1:09:26.980
What did I do now?

1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:28.830
Why would you tell her all that stuff?

1:09:29.020 --> 1:09:31.460
She asked.
And you know how your mother is.

1:09:31.580 --> 1:09:32.740
I can't lie to her.

1:09:32.940 --> 1:09:35.620
- Whatever.
-It's like she looks right through me.

1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:37.900
You know what? I'm going to bed.

1:09:39.220 --> 1:09:41.300
Do I need to go get my guitar?

1:09:41.740 --> 1:09:42.860
Good night.

1:10:01.460 --> 1:10:04.780
Is it important for your partner
to support your hobbies?

1:10:05.060 --> 1:10:07.980
Yes. I think it's very important for me
for that to happen, yeah.

1:10:08.540 --> 1:10:11.350
Yeah, I think over the years,

1:10:11.580 --> 1:10:15.470
with all my concentration
on my business, on success,

1:10:16.460 --> 1:10:19.740
I was afraid that I would give up
a part of myself, if I...

1:10:19.820 --> 1:10:20.900
Are you listening to me?

1:10:23.700 --> 1:10:25.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I...

1:10:25.740 --> 1:10:26.860
You don't want someone
that's gonna change you.

1:10:26.940 --> 1:10:27.860
Yeah.

1:10:28.020 --> 1:10:29.510
<i>Jeff stepping in front.</i>

1:10:29.580 --> 1:10:32.500
<i>He's coming back,
doing battle against his old squad.</i>

1:10:32.580 --> 1:10:34.620
<i>Play action. Down the middle. intercepted.</i>

1:10:34.940 --> 1:10:36.350
Come on!

1:10:36.420 --> 1:10:38.180
- Babe, <i>you see that?
- Intercepted by Kleinsmith.</i>

1:10:38.380 --> 1:10:39.820
Don't throw the ball in all that traffic.

1:10:39.940 --> 1:10:41.660
<i>Down the sidelines, out of bounds,</i>

1:10:41.740 --> 1:10:45.460
<i>across the 45 yard line of... Indiana to 47.</i>

1:10:48.340 --> 1:10:51.310
<i>Joe Kleinsmith.
He gets up limping off that play.</i>

1:10:51.860 --> 1:10:54.980
<i>But he's got an interception
and a 38 yard return.</i>

1:10:55.820 --> 1:10:59.060
<i>Kleinsmith doing a nice job of just
reading the eyes of the quarterback.</i>

1:10:59.140 --> 1:11:01.500
<i>Quarterback's gonna tell you
where he's going with the ball.</i>

1:11:03.340 --> 1:11:05.700
So is this what you wanted, huh?

1:11:05.900 --> 1:11:10.540
You wanted to just have sex with me
and just ignore me after that?

1:11:10.620 --> 1:11:14.750
<i>You come to the office.
You don't say "Hi." You don't call anybody.</i>

1:11:15.340 --> 1:11:17.990
<i>You were the one that said you were married
and you couldn't do this, right?</i>

1:11:18.060 --> 1:11:19.140
Right?

1:11:19.220 --> 1:11:21.540
<i>Why does it even matter
if I call you or not, Judith? Really?</i>

1:11:21.740 --> 1:11:23.230
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

1:11:23.740 --> 1:11:24.940
What are you talking about?

1:11:25.060 --> 1:11:27.220
I'm not a man that likes to play
these little silly games, Judith.

1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:28.830
<i>I'm not playing any games.</i>

1:11:29.300 --> 1:11:33.100
<i>Well, if you want me, then you say it.
All right?</i>

1:11:33.700 --> 1:11:36.860
<i>Live for once in your life,
Judith, damn, come on!</i>

1:11:37.060 --> 1:11:39.060
It's not that easy. Okay?

1:11:39.180 --> 1:11:40.220
Where is he right now?

1:11:41.420 --> 1:11:42.660
He's watching the game.

1:11:42.860 --> 1:11:44.220
Touchdown!

1:11:45.060 --> 1:11:46.100
Yes!

1:11:46.900 --> 1:11:47.980
Put him on the phone.

1:11:48.180 --> 1:11:49.260
Will you stop it?

1:11:49.340 --> 1:11:50.540
<i>No, put him on the phone, Judith.</i>

1:11:50.740 --> 1:11:52.260
No. Just stop it.

1:11:52.460 --> 1:11:54.900
<i>Why doesn't he wonder who
you're talking to on the phone right now?</i>

1:11:54.980 --> 1:11:56.220
Because he doesn't do that.

1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:59.230
If you were mine, I'd want to know.

1:12:02.220 --> 1:12:04.420
Well, I'm not yours, am I?

1:12:04.940 --> 1:12:06.220
Well, you could be.

1:12:10.300 --> 1:12:12.060
Does he make love to you better than me?

1:12:14.740 --> 1:12:17.100
I don't think anyone
makes love better than you.

1:12:23.340 --> 1:12:24.780
Tell me you want me.

1:12:26.060 --> 1:12:27.140
<i>Say it.</i>

1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:31.780
I want you.

1:12:32.620 --> 1:12:34.140
<i>Come see me right now.</i>

1:12:34.820 --> 1:12:36.500
I'll pick you up
on the corner of Wilmont and 3rd.

1:12:36.700 --> 1:12:38.700
I can't. I can't be there.

1:12:38.900 --> 1:12:42.300
I'm making dinner. And it's what? It's 8:30.

1:12:44.020 --> 1:12:45.260
I just can't.

1:12:46.020 --> 1:12:48.420
Hello? Hello?

1:12:54.380 --> 1:12:55.790
Pass the ball!

1:12:55.860 --> 1:12:59.620
<i>Look out! Leslie Majors on the run.</i>

1:13:02.060 --> 1:13:03.390
<i>Inside the Sycamore 40, out of bounds.</i>

1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:05.070
Dinner's ready, honey.

1:13:05.260 --> 1:13:07.140
Mom, I'm sorry, that was my boss.

1:13:07.220 --> 1:13:09.500
She just called.
She needs me to run an errand.

1:13:09.580 --> 1:13:10.660
What?

1:13:10.740 --> 1:13:12.900
I know, it's ridiculous. I'll see y'all later.

1:13:12.980 --> 1:13:14.020
Well...

1:13:14.100 --> 1:13:15.820
<i>...coming back for the football,
breaking off his route.</i>

1:13:15.900 --> 1:13:18.220
<i>Going down, getting the feet inbounds.
You see it there.</i>

1:13:18.300 --> 1:13:21.110
- That happen a lot?
- No, no, no!

1:13:21.180 --> 1:13:22.340
<i>Lewis able to pick up. Can he make...</i>

1:13:50.260 --> 1:13:51.590
Here you go.

1:13:54.140 --> 1:13:55.820
What's that?

1:13:57.180 --> 1:13:58.670
You really are from the country, aren't you?

1:13:58.820 --> 1:14:00.900
You've never even tried this before.
Let me give you a little bit.

1:14:00.980 --> 1:14:03.980
No,no,no.
I'm just gonna stick with the wine.

1:14:04.180 --> 1:14:05.300
You trust me, right?

1:14:07.060 --> 1:14:08.550
Of course.

1:14:09.460 --> 1:14:10.580
Go ahead.

1:14:13.700 --> 1:14:14.860
All right, Well...

1:14:19.460 --> 1:14:20.500
I've been thinking.

1:14:21.340 --> 1:14:23.460
Instead of going into business with Janice.

1:14:24.540 --> 1:14:27.300
You and me, we should start
that marriage counselor thing.

1:14:27.540 --> 1:14:29.540
Get that office open. I'd do that for you.

1:14:32.460 --> 1:14:34.780
- Are you serious? Really?
- Yeah.

1:14:34.860 --> 1:14:35.980
You would do that?

1:14:37.260 --> 1:14:38.620
One catch, though.

1:14:42.380 --> 1:14:43.740
You have to be mine.

1:14:49.500 --> 1:14:51.380
What do I do about Brice though?

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:57.230
Okay, we talked about Brice, babe.

1:14:57.740 --> 1:14:58.900
You leave him.

1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:03.220
Harley, I already feel so bad though,
about what we're doing.

1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:04.660
Then why are you here?

1:15:06.580 --> 1:15:08.020
You know why I'm here.

1:15:09.060 --> 1:15:10.940
Why don't you just go home?
Get out of my house.

1:15:11.020 --> 1:15:13.670
Shit if I'm gon' try and play
these little games with you. No, go.

1:15:13.740 --> 1:15:15.150
What are you talking about?

1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:16.460
Go.

1:15:16.700 --> 1:15:19.350
You realize that you're
kicking me out your house.

1:15:19.420 --> 1:15:20.830
You know what? Fine then.

1:15:21.860 --> 1:15:23.820
Forget it. Asshole!

1:15:23.900 --> 1:15:25.060
Fine!

1:15:26.100 --> 1:15:29.020
Fine! Don't ever ask me
to cook or come over again.

1:15:29.100 --> 1:15:30.100
Bastard!

1:15:30.740 --> 1:15:33.470
Don't call me again, you jackass.

1:15:53.100 --> 1:15:55.020
You comin' in awfully late.

1:15:59.020 --> 1:16:01.020
- Where's Brice?
- What's wrong with you?

1:16:02.260 --> 1:16:05.540
Nothing, Mama. My boss made me upset.

1:16:06.060 --> 1:16:08.630
Brice is in the bed. What's wrong with you?

1:16:09.140 --> 1:16:11.420
I'm just gonna take a shower, okay?

1:16:12.100 --> 1:16:13.300
You been drinking?

1:16:15.060 --> 1:16:17.540
I had a glass of wine. All right?

1:16:17.620 --> 1:16:19.620
With that devil in the red car.

1:16:20.740 --> 1:16:24.340
No, not with him. And he ain't no devil.

1:16:27.300 --> 1:16:29.500
Who you think you talkin' to?

1:16:31.180 --> 1:16:34.420
You know you never could lie to me.
I'm your mother.

1:16:36.060 --> 1:16:38.220
God's not pleased with this, daughter.

1:16:41.660 --> 1:16:43.100
I knew when you moved here.

1:16:43.220 --> 1:16:45.900
I knew the devil was gon' be after you.
I just knew it.

1:16:46.620 --> 1:16:50.020
And look at you. You're fallen.

1:16:51.100 --> 1:16:53.140
Look at you, you're changing.

1:16:53.340 --> 1:16:55.860
Please, baby, come back.

1:16:56.980 --> 1:16:59.660
Now, you know I taught you
the ways of the Lord.

1:17:00.340 --> 1:17:01.750
You know better.

1:17:02.180 --> 1:17:04.780
Come on out here, now. Come pray with me.

1:17:04.860 --> 1:17:08.060
Okay, Mama. I'll come out there
and I'll pray with you.

1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:10.220
But then what?

1:17:11.380 --> 1:17:13.060
Am I supposed to stop wearing makeup?

1:17:13.140 --> 1:17:14.940
And wear dresses down to my ankle,

1:17:15.020 --> 1:17:17.460
and pretend like I'm all holy and happy,

1:17:17.540 --> 1:17:20.060
and sanctified for the Lord like you do?

1:17:20.540 --> 1:17:22.420
Nobody's pretending, baby.

1:17:22.820 --> 1:17:26.380
Yeah, well, I'm just saying
it don't take all that to love the Lord.

1:17:27.620 --> 1:17:30.820
Why you so disrespectful to me?

1:17:31.300 --> 1:17:34.270
I'm just saying what my father
shoulda told you long ago.

1:17:37.580 --> 1:17:40.150
Now, you can just leave him right outta this.

1:17:40.220 --> 1:17:41.900
God bless the dead.

1:17:42.900 --> 1:17:44.420
God bless the dead?

1:17:44.500 --> 1:17:46.700
So, Mama, we're still doing that act?

1:17:47.060 --> 1:17:48.220
When you gon' quit it?

1:17:48.340 --> 1:17:50.860
We both know he's still alive. Yeah.

1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:54.670
I found him in Youngstown, Mama.

1:17:55.020 --> 1:17:56.590
And he told me all about you.

1:17:56.980 --> 1:18:00.220
And how you left him
the second you joined that church.

1:18:00.420 --> 1:18:01.910
How you kept him outta my life.

1:18:01.980 --> 1:18:04.140
So what do you gotta lie about it for?

1:18:04.260 --> 1:18:06.830
You trying to turn this all around on me.

1:18:07.420 --> 1:18:09.940
But it's not about me. It's about you.

1:18:10.900 --> 1:18:15.420
That fool out there,
'bout to make a bigger fool outta you.

1:18:16.260 --> 1:18:19.780
That boy is gonna hurt you somethin' bad.

1:18:20.460 --> 1:18:23.460
And he gon' take you straight to hell.

1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:26.540
Well, I'll enjoy the ride.

1:18:28.260 --> 1:18:30.260
Where you get that smart mouth from?

1:18:31.100 --> 1:18:33.750
How dare you talk to me like that?

1:18:34.580 --> 1:18:36.300
I done worked my fingers to the bone

1:18:36.380 --> 1:18:38.180
to make sure you had a decent life.

1:18:38.940 --> 1:18:40.940
I done cleaned more toilets
than you can think of

1:18:41.100 --> 1:18:43.700
and then you would talk
to your mother like this?

1:18:44.700 --> 1:18:45.900
Not today.

1:18:46.780 --> 1:18:47.940
Not today!

1:18:48.300 --> 1:18:49.380
What's going on?

1:18:50.140 --> 1:18:51.790
Well, you know my mother.

1:18:51.940 --> 1:18:56.580
She feels that the devil is after me,
so she in there hollerin'.

1:18:56.660 --> 1:18:59.820
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

1:18:59.940 --> 1:19:01.700
"I will fear no evil.

1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:05.100
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures."

1:19:05.300 --> 1:19:07.740
Brice, I need you take care of my child.

1:19:07.820 --> 1:19:09.860
I will, but tell me what's going on.

1:19:10.220 --> 1:19:12.140
God, Lord, Jesus and the Host.

1:19:12.220 --> 1:19:15.110
- Judith, what's going on?
- Please, not you, too.

1:19:15.700 --> 1:19:19.180
Judith, I've never seen her or you
act like this. Talk to me.

1:19:19.260 --> 1:19:23.420
Brice, okay, I just want to go take a shower.
It's really not that deep.

1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:26.070
No, Judith, Judith, talk to me. Please.

1:19:26.340 --> 1:19:28.940
Judith, talk to me. Judith!

1:19:29.980 --> 1:19:30.980
Judith!

1:19:34.460 --> 1:19:35.820
Please!

1:23:00.300 --> 1:23:01.710
Wait a minute.

1:23:02.380 --> 1:23:04.540
Those are not my hand-me-downs.

1:23:04.700 --> 1:23:07.270
No, they are not. Take that for me.

1:23:07.340 --> 1:23:09.460
Oh, my God. You caught on.

1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:12.220
Wait a minute. Wait.
You caught on. Let me see.

1:23:12.700 --> 1:23:15.220
- I am so proud.
- Like it? Yes?

1:23:15.300 --> 1:23:17.740
This is my finest moment in life.

1:23:17.820 --> 1:23:19.390
- Is Janice in?
- Yes.

1:23:25.540 --> 1:23:26.580
Hi.

1:23:27.620 --> 1:23:29.110
What, you don't knock?

1:23:29.740 --> 1:23:31.980
Just the person I wanted to see. Have a seat.

1:23:32.060 --> 1:23:33.060
No, I'll stand.

1:23:35.500 --> 1:23:40.380
I wanted to thank you for the job,
but this will be my last week.

1:23:43.140 --> 1:23:46.110
No. This is your last day.

1:23:47.020 --> 1:23:52.020
I just got a call from Harley,
telling me that he's out of the deal with me

1:23:52.100 --> 1:23:55.380
and opening a practice for you.

1:23:56.780 --> 1:23:58.190
That's what we plan to do.

1:23:58.740 --> 1:23:59.780
We?

1:24:04.100 --> 1:24:05.180
Little girl,

1:24:05.860 --> 1:24:11.260
you have no idea what you are in for.

1:24:13.100 --> 1:24:16.660
But I wish you all the best
with your struggle.

1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:25.820
You know, I've been meaning to tell you,

1:24:26.300 --> 1:24:29.300
you are in an existential identity crisis.

1:24:29.460 --> 1:24:30.790
I did my research on you.

1:24:31.060 --> 1:24:32.140
You spent those two weeks in Paris

1:24:32.260 --> 1:24:34.100
and all of a sudden
you got a French accent?

1:24:34.460 --> 1:24:36.340
Girl, we know you from Georgia.

1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:41.300
Bitch, you better
get your ass outta my office.

1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:43.900
Now!

1:24:53.860 --> 1:24:54.900
That should do it.

1:24:54.980 --> 1:24:56.820
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:25:00.660 --> 1:25:02.150
What's going on? You okay?

1:25:04.300 --> 1:25:05.340
Yeah.

1:25:06.660 --> 1:25:07.990
Why are you so quiet?

1:25:10.580 --> 1:25:11.740
I'm sorry.

1:25:13.380 --> 1:25:14.540
Brice, what's the matter?

1:25:14.820 --> 1:25:16.020
Melinda, I'm fine.

1:25:16.100 --> 1:25:18.670
No, you're not. Come on.

1:25:19.460 --> 1:25:22.660
Everything you done for me here,
let me return the favor.

1:25:25.940 --> 1:25:27.300
What's going on?

1:25:29.220 --> 1:25:31.220
I think I lost my wife.

1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:35.780
I'm sorry.

1:25:36.460 --> 1:25:38.500
I'm so sorry. Are you sure?

1:25:40.660 --> 1:25:42.660
I can't even believe it.

1:25:44.340 --> 1:25:45.540
I don't know what I did wrong.

1:25:45.620 --> 1:25:47.740
I didn't know it was that bad.
I just thought that...

1:25:47.820 --> 1:25:50.790
Brice, sometimes we can
get comfortable with people.

1:25:51.140 --> 1:25:53.460
And that's what causes the problems.

1:25:54.380 --> 1:25:55.460
That's how it is.

1:25:55.540 --> 1:25:57.380
But I didn't even know she was unhappy.

1:25:57.540 --> 1:25:59.060
Well, she probably wasn't.

1:25:59.420 --> 1:26:01.660
Most times you're happy
until somebody comes along

1:26:01.780 --> 1:26:03.540
and shows you something different.

1:26:04.060 --> 1:26:06.220
Maybe I did take her for granted.

1:26:06.860 --> 1:26:10.060
Well, say you did. But this is wrong.

1:26:11.180 --> 1:26:13.860
This is wrong of her, man.
You don't deserve this.

1:26:14.580 --> 1:26:17.700
You can't take the responsibility
for what she did.

1:26:18.180 --> 1:26:19.140
Because when people cheat...

1:26:19.220 --> 1:26:20.790
I never said she was cheating.

1:26:20.860 --> 1:26:22.060
She's cheating.

1:26:23.300 --> 1:26:24.820
Miss Waco, I didn't...

1:26:24.900 --> 1:26:27.900
Calm down! But the lesbian is right.

1:26:29.300 --> 1:26:32.620
Lesbian? I'm not a lesbian.

1:26:34.420 --> 1:26:35.500
You're not?

1:26:35.780 --> 1:26:38.510
I'm sorry. I thought that you...

1:26:38.580 --> 1:26:40.660
The boots and the sweater.

1:26:42.140 --> 1:26:43.180
You know, she's met somebody

1:26:43.260 --> 1:26:46.860
that's making her look at life differently.
Face it!

1:26:48.180 --> 1:26:49.380
So what do I do?

1:26:49.940 --> 1:26:53.020
If you see a mob fighting with bricks,

1:26:53.100 --> 1:26:57.020
you don't join in the fight
unless you have one, too.

1:26:58.660 --> 1:26:59.940
May I help you?

1:27:01.780 --> 1:27:03.540
You have a prescription?

1:27:28.740 --> 1:27:30.390
Hey, I wanna go home with you.

1:27:50.940 --> 1:27:51.940
Judith!

1:27:54.020 --> 1:27:56.060
- Hey, Brice.
- Come on, let's go.

1:27:57.180 --> 1:27:58.340
Go home.

1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:01.500
Judith, let's go, now! Get up!

1:28:01.740 --> 1:28:03.860
I don't think she wants to go with you.

1:28:05.140 --> 1:28:06.790
Judith, let's go!

1:28:07.780 --> 1:28:11.020
- Baby, I'm getting tired of this.
- Baby? Get up.

1:28:11.700 --> 1:28:13.700
- Get up.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1:28:15.420 --> 1:28:16.620
Get offa me.

1:28:18.100 --> 1:28:20.100
Get your damn hands offa me!

1:28:21.340 --> 1:28:22.580
Get offa me!

1:28:25.820 --> 1:28:27.310
What is wrong with you?

1:28:28.540 --> 1:28:29.870
Get your damn hands off of me!

1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:31.220
Have you lost your mind?

1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:32.860
Maybe.

1:28:33.540 --> 1:28:36.820
I'm at home waiting on you.
And this is what you're doing?

1:28:37.220 --> 1:28:39.180
Well, stop waiting, Brice.

1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:41.940
This is how you do me?

1:28:43.020 --> 1:28:44.980
You're messing around with this clown.

1:28:47.020 --> 1:28:49.700
Baby, you don't know how much I love you.

1:28:55.780 --> 1:28:57.220
Baby, come home.

1:28:58.460 --> 1:29:00.030
If you come home,

1:29:02.340 --> 1:29:04.260
I promise you I'll never mention it again.

1:29:04.340 --> 1:29:05.580
Just come home, please.

1:29:09.980 --> 1:29:11.260
Please.

1:29:14.220 --> 1:29:15.900
Oh, you're such a good guy.

1:29:18.380 --> 1:29:20.700
And I really hope you find a nice girl.

1:29:23.300 --> 1:29:24.740
What are you saying to me?

1:29:30.900 --> 1:29:33.220
I feel so dead with you, Brice.

1:29:34.740 --> 1:29:35.940
I do.

1:29:36.420 --> 1:29:39.150
And I wanna feel alive. I wanna feel wanted.

1:29:39.220 --> 1:29:40.260
I don't.

1:29:41.140 --> 1:29:44.780
You took me for granted. You did.

1:29:46.620 --> 1:29:50.460
I don't just want a good guy.
I want a phenomenal guy.

1:29:52.540 --> 1:29:54.220
You're not phenomenal.

1:29:55.700 --> 1:29:58.620
What are you... What are you saying to me?

1:30:03.620 --> 1:30:05.860
We have someone I can pay

1:30:05.980 --> 1:30:08.420
to help you through this
and help counsel you.

1:30:09.420 --> 1:30:10.500
What?

1:30:14.460 --> 1:30:16.460
Judith, you're not saying this to me.

1:30:20.300 --> 1:30:22.020
I tried. I loved you.

1:30:23.420 --> 1:30:24.940
I wanted to love you.

1:30:25.500 --> 1:30:27.420
And I'm sorry if I failed.

1:30:29.300 --> 1:30:30.660
I'm sorry.

1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:35.660
Fine.

1:30:37.660 --> 1:30:39.820
I will help you pack your shit.

1:30:44.140 --> 1:30:47.220
I don't need anything. I'll just get my laptop.

1:30:48.660 --> 1:30:50.620
I have everything I need,

1:30:51.180 --> 1:30:53.380
everything I could ask for here.

1:30:56.500 --> 1:30:57.740
Bye.

1:31:48.220 --> 1:31:49.220
Here you go.

1:31:53.220 --> 1:31:54.740
How are you doing? You okay?

1:32:03.420 --> 1:32:04.420
No.

1:32:05.780 --> 1:32:07.620
I understand what you're going through.

1:32:09.660 --> 1:32:12.100
She was just so cold.

1:32:15.260 --> 1:32:16.980
She wasn't herself.

1:32:20.780 --> 1:32:22.740
Her mother warned me. She was right.

1:32:23.380 --> 1:32:25.300
Brice, I'm so sorry.

1:32:27.620 --> 1:32:28.860
I know this pain.

1:32:35.700 --> 1:32:36.900
What are you doing?

1:32:37.380 --> 1:32:39.620
We're not attracted to each other.

1:32:40.220 --> 1:32:41.940
Okay, you're just hurting
and you'll do anything

1:32:42.020 --> 1:32:43.350
to make the pain go away.

1:32:43.420 --> 1:32:45.740
Trust me. I've been there.

1:32:47.780 --> 1:32:49.020
I'm sorry.

1:32:49.900 --> 1:32:51.980
I know it hurts right now.

1:32:52.660 --> 1:32:55.260
And I'm not gon' lie to you,
it's gon' hurt for a long time,

1:32:55.380 --> 1:32:57.460
and it's gon' seem like it's forever.

1:32:59.780 --> 1:33:02.460
But you're gonna get through this.
I promise.

1:33:05.460 --> 1:33:08.940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:33:21.460 --> 1:33:22.500
You coming up?

1:33:22.980 --> 1:33:24.900
Hell, yeah, I'm comin' up.

1:33:24.980 --> 1:33:27.100
I wanna see how this dude has you livin'.

1:33:27.180 --> 1:33:29.660
Well, he should be at work,
so he's not home.

1:33:31.540 --> 1:33:33.110
Hey, move it! You're blocking the road!

1:33:33.180 --> 1:33:34.220
Go around.

1:33:54.180 --> 1:33:57.070
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.

1:33:57.980 --> 1:33:59.780
Oh, my Jesus.

1:34:00.340 --> 1:34:01.540
We have to go.

1:34:01.620 --> 1:34:02.860
Forgive us our sins.

1:34:03.260 --> 1:34:05.830
Lead all souls to you, Lord.

1:34:06.020 --> 1:34:09.740
Especially those in most need
of Thy Divine Mercy, Lord.

1:34:10.380 --> 1:34:13.110
No, no. Let's have a little fun with this.

1:34:13.740 --> 1:34:14.780
Hello, Reverend.

1:34:14.860 --> 1:34:15.940
Save my child!

1:34:16.020 --> 1:34:17.430
Sisters.

1:34:25.940 --> 1:34:28.420
Oh, the Lord done answered
my prayers, sisters.

1:34:28.500 --> 1:34:30.460
- My child is home.
- I'm getting my computer.

1:34:30.580 --> 1:34:35.020
Sweet baby, please stay.
Please stay. You're not safe.

1:34:35.140 --> 1:34:37.710
I brought all the sisters here to pray for you.

1:34:37.860 --> 1:34:40.020
- We need you to stay here.
- I'm fine, Mama.

1:34:40.380 --> 1:34:41.790
I know you think you are,
but you're not, darling.

1:34:41.860 --> 1:34:45.220
- Okay. We gon' go. All right? I love you.
- You're in danger.

1:34:45.300 --> 1:34:46.300
Let's go.

1:34:46.420 --> 1:34:48.540
- No, sweetie.
- Mom, give me this.

1:34:48.740 --> 1:34:49.700
I need it

1:34:49.780 --> 1:34:50.820
Please, stay here. I'm begging you.

1:34:50.900 --> 1:34:52.740
- There's something on this.
- Mama, we need to get...

1:34:52.820 --> 1:34:54.660
- Stop it!
- Damn!

1:34:55.180 --> 1:34:56.260
Satan!

1:34:58.940 --> 1:35:00.430
Give me that now.

1:35:00.980 --> 1:35:05.220
What the hell? Mama, you okay? You okay?

1:35:05.300 --> 1:35:07.700
- You're good, right? Stand up.
- My sweet baby!

1:35:07.780 --> 1:35:09.060
Now you see what I mean?

1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:10.470
No, he didn't mean it. He didn't mean it.

1:35:10.540 --> 1:35:12.260
You need to stay here with me, baby, please.

1:35:12.340 --> 1:35:14.740
- Get up. Get up!
- Get your hands off my baby!

1:35:14.820 --> 1:35:16.500
- I'm talking to her!
- Mama, hold on now.

1:35:16.620 --> 1:35:18.740
Get up. Girl, get up.

1:35:19.100 --> 1:35:23.020
Sister Sarah, you tried. You tried.

1:35:23.340 --> 1:35:26.580
I don't know if she's hurt.
I don't know if her bruised knee is okay.

1:35:26.660 --> 1:35:28.540
I don't know nothin' because
you just jacked me outta there!

1:35:28.620 --> 1:35:31.380
Bring your ass back here. Come back here.
You come back.

1:35:31.460 --> 1:35:33.030
Get the hell off me! Don't you touch me!

1:35:33.140 --> 1:35:36.460
- Whose side are you on?
- She's my mother, you jerk!

1:35:36.660 --> 1:35:38.660
I don't give a damn
about your mama, Judith!

1:35:38.740 --> 1:35:40.500
Yeah, obviously, you don't!

1:35:41.140 --> 1:35:42.630
The way you pushed her down!

1:35:43.300 --> 1:35:44.820
- Get up the stairs!
- Don't touch me!

1:35:44.900 --> 1:35:46.940
Get up the stairs if I wanna get up the stairs.

1:35:47.620 --> 1:35:49.940
So you just gon'
take her side like that? Huh?

1:35:50.020 --> 1:35:51.260
- Take her side?
- Yeah!

1:35:51.340 --> 1:35:53.300
This is not about me taking her side, Harley.

1:35:53.380 --> 1:35:55.950
It's the fact that you will not understand
what it feels like

1:35:56.020 --> 1:35:58.340
to watch your mother thrown to the ground!

1:35:58.860 --> 1:36:00.900
Look, just because your mother
abandoned you in some crack house,

1:36:00.980 --> 1:36:02.740
don't mean you gotta abuse mine!

1:36:05.140 --> 1:36:08.030
I don't give a damn what she did.

1:36:08.300 --> 1:36:10.340
It ain't about what she did.

1:36:11.540 --> 1:36:13.540
Shoot, yes, she annoys me, too.
She's still my mother.

1:36:13.620 --> 1:36:15.110
Where is my shit, bitch?

1:36:15.180 --> 1:36:16.860
She don't deserve to be treated that way.

1:36:20.180 --> 1:36:23.500
Judith, you know that I'm just
crazy in love with you, okay?

1:36:23.620 --> 1:36:24.860
And it just...

1:36:25.300 --> 1:36:27.820
lt just makes me really upset
when you're not on my side, okay?

1:36:27.900 --> 1:36:30.180
I'm gonna just give you some space
right now.

1:36:31.220 --> 1:36:32.340
You leaving?

1:36:36.220 --> 1:36:37.340
Judith?

1:36:38.380 --> 1:36:40.580
It's just, this really is not healthy.

1:36:41.340 --> 1:36:43.260
You gon' leave me?
Is that what you gonna do?

1:36:43.340 --> 1:36:45.860
- What the hell are you...
- Is that what you gon' do?

1:36:46.180 --> 1:36:47.620
What do you know about cooking?

1:36:47.700 --> 1:36:49.460
Boy, this is what I do.

1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:56.900
Thank you.

1:36:57.980 --> 1:36:59.390
Don't mention it.

1:36:59.580 --> 1:37:01.700
I didn't want yo' ass to jump.

1:37:02.700 --> 1:37:04.060
I'm not gonna jump.

1:37:04.220 --> 1:37:05.260
Good.

1:37:07.580 --> 1:37:09.500
It hurts like hell, though.

1:37:10.220 --> 1:37:11.550
I know.

1:37:12.260 --> 1:37:13.780
I know where you are.

1:37:14.260 --> 1:37:16.500
You can cook. You're a good woman.

1:37:17.900 --> 1:37:19.860
You think you'll ever find love again?

1:37:22.340 --> 1:37:24.420
You can't run from that guy forever.

1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:27.420
I believe in love and marriage

1:37:28.540 --> 1:37:30.700
and I really hope you find a nice guy.

1:37:38.220 --> 1:37:39.460
Brice...

1:37:40.740 --> 1:37:42.260
I have HIV.

1:37:56.900 --> 1:37:58.940
- Melinda, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1:37:59.900 --> 1:38:01.470
I'm dealing with it.

1:38:02.620 --> 1:38:04.380
I made the choice to be with my ex.

1:38:04.940 --> 1:38:07.420
Even though
I knew he was sleeping around,

1:38:08.060 --> 1:38:10.060
so I accepted my part in it.

1:38:11.140 --> 1:38:13.380
I'm taking my meds, so I'm doing good.

1:38:17.140 --> 1:38:18.740
But to answer your question...

1:38:19.460 --> 1:38:22.660
No. I'm not running from Harley anymore.

1:38:25.620 --> 1:38:26.820
Harley?

1:38:26.940 --> 1:38:28.740
Yeah, the Class-Meet guy.

1:38:34.180 --> 1:38:35.340
- What's wrong?
- Judith.

1:38:35.420 --> 1:38:37.900
- What? What's the matter?
- Judith!

1:38:37.980 --> 1:38:40.100
- Judith!
- Judith? What about Judith?

1:38:40.180 --> 1:38:43.460
- My wife is with him!
- Okay, okay. Oh, my God.

1:39:19.380 --> 1:39:20.540
Judith!

1:39:23.180 --> 1:39:24.300
Judith!

1:39:45.660 --> 1:39:46.860
No. No, no, no, no.

1:39:47.380 --> 1:39:50.740
Judith, baby, it's me. It's Brice.

1:39:51.020 --> 1:39:52.300
No, no, no, it's me.

1:39:53.420 --> 1:39:55.540
I'm gonna take you home.
I'm taking you home.

1:39:55.860 --> 1:39:57.100
It's me, baby.

1:39:59.100 --> 1:40:00.220
Brice!

1:40:00.740 --> 1:40:02.660
- Yeah.
- I knew you'd come.

1:40:02.940 --> 1:40:04.270
He did this to you?

1:40:05.380 --> 1:40:06.620
I deserve it.

1:40:06.860 --> 1:40:07.940
You don't deserve this.

1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:10.020
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

1:40:11.060 --> 1:40:13.100
I was so mean to you.

1:40:15.020 --> 1:40:16.780
I'm so sorry.

1:40:17.780 --> 1:40:19.540
I'm so sorry.

1:40:19.940 --> 1:40:22.830
You think we can fix it? We can fix it, right?

1:40:23.420 --> 1:40:25.140
We'll fix it.

1:40:26.260 --> 1:40:27.380
Okay.

1:40:28.700 --> 1:40:30.500
Where are you hurt?

1:40:33.300 --> 1:40:34.540
Right here.

1:40:39.100 --> 1:40:40.590
I hurt your heart.

1:40:48.620 --> 1:40:49.620
It's okay.

1:40:52.100 --> 1:40:54.100
Come on, babe, I'm gonna get you home.

1:40:55.420 --> 1:40:56.940
I'm gonna get you outta here.

1:40:59.460 --> 1:41:01.110
I'm gonna get you outta here. Come on.

1:41:08.620 --> 1:41:09.740
It's okay.

1:41:12.460 --> 1:41:13.950
<i>L</i> 90'! YOU- I got you.

1:41:18.820 --> 1:41:19.820
<i>I</i> got you.

1:41:21.820 --> 1:41:22.940
My God!

1:41:24.300 --> 1:41:25.340
Careful.

1:41:34.500 --> 1:41:36.660
Get up. Get up!

1:41:58.060 --> 1:41:59.140
Oh, my God.

1:42:00.660 --> 1:42:02.900
Brice, stop, you gon' kill him.

1:42:15.500 --> 1:42:16.540
Karen.

1:42:18.380 --> 1:42:19.420
Yeah.

1:42:20.700 --> 1:42:22.140
It's me, Karen.

1:42:23.340 --> 1:42:24.990
I knew you'd come back.

1:42:28.220 --> 1:42:29.660
Come here, girl.

1:42:29.860 --> 1:42:32.670
Don't you ever come near her
or my wife again.

1:42:34.260 --> 1:42:35.700
Karen. Karen.

1:42:47.380 --> 1:42:49.500
I'm sorry. I know you have to go.

1:42:50.260 --> 1:42:51.260
Wow.

1:42:53.900 --> 1:42:55.310
What happened to Judith?

1:43:02.060 --> 1:43:03.060
Well...

1:43:04.020 --> 1:43:05.430
She's alive.

1:43:06.420 --> 1:43:08.070
How does this story end?

1:43:08.780 --> 1:43:10.220
It's still being written.

1:43:13.700 --> 1:43:15.380
Did she get HIV, too?

1:43:20.300 --> 1:43:21.380
Yes.

1:43:22.420 --> 1:43:23.540
Brice??

1:43:24.820 --> 1:43:25.820
No.

1:43:27.260 --> 1:43:29.780
Thank you so much
for sharing this story with me.

1:43:32.060 --> 1:43:35.100
I'm gonna end this "almost" affair
and stay with my husband.

1:44:09.020 --> 1:44:10.980
Karen. Hey.

1:44:11.140 --> 1:44:12.660

1:44:26.020 --> 1:44:27.020
How are you?

1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:29.980
I'm good. I spoke to your doctor.

1:44:30.140 --> 1:44:32.620
He changed your dosage
to get your T-cell count up.

1:44:32.980 --> 1:44:33.980
Okay.

1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:36.140
How are you feeling?

1:44:36.220 --> 1:44:37.460
I'm fine. I'm good.

1:44:38.300 --> 1:44:39.300
Where you headed to?

1:44:39.620 --> 1:44:42.620
I'm going to church.
Mama's there waiting for me.

1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:44.900
Okay. Well, be careful.

1:44:46.180 --> 1:44:48.830
And if you ever need anything,
I'm here for you, Judith.

1:44:51.700 --> 1:44:54.220
- See you next month.
- I'll see you next month.

1:44:58.060 --> 1:44:59.820

1:45:01.180 --> 1:45:02.510
Hi, little man.

He's so cute.

1:45:03.860 --> 1:45:05.510

Hey, Daddy.

1:45:10.540 --> 1:45:12.030
