00:02.196 --> 00:03.518
Previously on "Castle"...

00:03.519 --> 00:05.752
Whoever owns that account

00:05.753 --> 00:07.948
is the person that killed my mom.

00:07.949 --> 00:10.133
It belonged to a guy named
William H. Bracken.

00:10.170 --> 00:12.413
You mean Senator William Bracken?

00:13.335 --> 00:15.593
He's protected. Untouchable.

00:15.606 --> 00:17.158
You're just gonna end up dead.

00:17.175 --> 00:18.437
What do you want, Ms. Beckett?

00:18.438 --> 00:21.483
Everyone that you've ever had killed,

00:21.484 --> 00:23.134
I want the truth.

00:23.135 --> 00:25.239
See, here's what you don't understand.

00:25.281 --> 00:26.744
It's not who has the gun.

00:27.412 --> 00:29.440
It's who has the power.

00:30.742 --> 00:32.785
Do you really think that's you?

00:35.514 --> 00:37.555
That's gonna leave a nasty scar.

00:37.861 --> 00:41.022
Every time you see it, think of me.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:05.928 --> 01:07.045
So what makes you so sure

01:07.046 --> 01:09.412
that Alexis isn't serious about this guy?

01:09.413 --> 01:11.160
Well, I haven't met him
or approved of him yet

01:11.161 --> 01:12.135
so it can't be serious.

01:12.136 --> 01:13.402
All suitors must be

01:13.403 --> 01:16.082
met and intimidated by me personally

01:16.210 --> 01:19.539
before they can be considered
for official boyfriend status.

01:19.724 --> 01:21.926
I would not do that.

01:23.002 --> 01:24.999
Her body was in that barrel over there,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.461
burned, and I mean beyond recognition.

01:27.548 --> 01:29.057
Any chance of a positive I.D.?

01:29.058 --> 01:30.269
Not from fingerprints.

01:30.270 --> 01:32.775
But bone structure tells
me it's a young woman,

01:32.776 --> 01:33.749
about 5'4".

01:33.750 --> 01:35.242
So a transient?

01:35.243 --> 01:37.834
I doubt it. There's a bullet
hole in the back of her head

01:37.835 --> 01:39.425
and then there's her teeth.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.922
Every one of them was
knocked out of her mouth.

01:41.929 --> 01:43.375
So much for dental records.

01:43.593 --> 01:45.475
Well, someone obviously
went to great lengths

01:45.476 --> 01:46.892
to make sure she disappeared.

01:46.893 --> 01:49.305
So... none of these guys saw anything.

01:49.306 --> 01:50.623
They panhandle by day.

01:50.665 --> 01:52.357
Don't come back here till it's dark.

01:52.390 --> 01:53.523
The first guy who showed up said

01:53.524 --> 01:54.756
the fire was already going.

01:54.757 --> 01:56.122
Sounds like a dump job.

01:56.173 --> 01:57.307
All right. We have a female.

01:57.308 --> 02:00.463
She's 5'4". Let's start looking
through missing persons reports.

02:00.464 --> 02:01.491
Wait.

02:01.492 --> 02:03.376
You may not have to do that.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.697
A titanium screw from her jaw.

02:07.782 --> 02:08.931
Dental implant.

02:08.933 --> 02:10.360
And there's a batch number,

02:10.362 --> 02:12.390
which could give us her name.

02:13.441 --> 02:16.316
We traced that dental screw
to Melanie Rogers, 27.

02:16.317 --> 02:18.688
Lived in New Jersey near
Rutgers University,

02:18.689 --> 02:20.622
where she was a postdoc engineer

02:20.623 --> 02:22.127
in eco-friendly design.

02:22.128 --> 02:24.456
By all accounts, she was
well-liked, respected.

02:24.457 --> 02:26.699
No one I spoke to had any idea
who could've done this to her.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.062
What's an engineer from New Jersey

02:28.063 --> 02:30.264
doing in a barrel in lower Manhattan?

02:30.265 --> 02:32.265
I don't know, but something
was going on with her.

02:32.355 --> 02:34.302
I pulled her phone records for yesterday.

02:34.303 --> 02:36.539
She made a half a dozen
calls to the same number

02:36.540 --> 02:37.662
in a 20-minute period.

02:37.663 --> 02:39.034
Boyfriend?
Could be.

02:39.035 --> 02:41.093
It's a 2-0-2 number, but
it's listed as blocked.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.010
2-0-2. Uh, that's Washington, D.C.

02:43.011 --> 02:45.408
Yeah. Preliminary check
shows it's a cell phone.

02:45.409 --> 02:47.205
Which means whoever it
is might be in the city.

02:47.206 --> 02:48.713
Let's get a warrant on that phone number.

02:48.714 --> 02:51.321
She made one other call after
that, around 4:00 P.M.

02:51.322 --> 02:53.452
And then after that, all her
phone activity went dark.

02:53.453 --> 02:54.505
Who was the call to?

02:54.506 --> 02:56.035
It was to her half sister Julie.

02:56.036 --> 02:57.608
I took a look. She's her only family.

02:57.609 --> 02:59.305
She works as a loan officer in midtown.

02:59.306 --> 03:01.496
Bring her in. She might be
able to shed some light.

03:03.790 --> 03:06.319
Melanie and I were never all that close.

03:06.694 --> 03:09.685
But when our dad got sick, we, um...

03:10.722 --> 03:12.084
We found each other.

03:12.332 --> 03:13.033
Do you have any idea

03:13.034 --> 03:15.505
what your sister was doing
in the city yesterday?

03:15.674 --> 03:18.018
No. She came in from time to time.

03:18.019 --> 03:20.094
Do you know if she was
dating anyone recently?

03:21.187 --> 03:22.985
Someone from D.C. perhaps?

03:23.016 --> 03:24.632
Not that I knew about.

03:25.589 --> 03:26.660
Although...

03:26.968 --> 03:29.035
just two nights ago,
she met me for dinner.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.607
She mentioned meeting a friend afterwards.

03:31.608 --> 03:32.600
Did she say who?

03:32.601 --> 03:33.399
Well, I asked,

03:33.400 --> 03:35.652
but she said she couldn't talk
about it for some reason.

03:36.026 --> 03:37.986
So when you spoke with her yesterday,

03:37.987 --> 03:39.850
did it sound like anything was wrong?

03:40.549 --> 03:42.214
I never spoke to her yesterday.

03:42.215 --> 03:45.447
Her phone records indicate
she called you about 4:00.

03:45.971 --> 03:47.112
00?

03:47.176 --> 03:48.833
N-no. I was in a meeting.

03:53.064 --> 03:54.301
Oh, my God.

03:54.810 --> 03:56.389
She left a message.

03:58.778 --> 04:01.406
It's me. Listen, I think
something's going on.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.315
Something's not right.

04:02.316 --> 04:03.975
I'm pretty sure someone's after me.

04:03.976 --> 04:05.577
She's in a parking structure.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.211
You can hear two sets of footsteps.
Mm-hmm.

04:07.212 --> 04:10.381
If anything happens, tell them X-T-3--

04:14.758 --> 04:15.847
That's it.

04:15.937 --> 04:17.925
She recorded her own murder.

04:18.569 --> 04:20.531
Okay, parking structure,
letters and numbers.

04:20.533 --> 04:22.120
Sounds like she's reading
off a license plate.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.856
Of the guy that was following her.

04:23.857 --> 04:26.959
And X-T-3, I mean, there's
gonna be thousands of plates

04:26.960 --> 04:28.432
with that partial.

04:29.425 --> 04:30.547
Can you play the end again?

04:30.548 --> 04:32.908
I thought I heard something
after the phone hit the ground.

04:39.949 --> 04:41.860
There. Did you hear that?

04:41.861 --> 04:43.144
There's a click.

04:43.434 --> 04:44.930
Let me see what I can do with that.

05:13.339 --> 05:15.066
At the Standish Hotel at 11:00 P.M.

05:15.067 --> 05:16.830
Perhaps she was meeting
her Washington friend

05:16.831 --> 05:17.697
for a secret tryst?

05:17.698 --> 05:18.675
It makes sense.

05:18.676 --> 05:19.749
The Standish is popular

05:19.750 --> 05:21.902
with married men who value discretion.

05:22.057 --> 05:24.114
Maybe someone at the
hotel saw her with him.

05:27.403 --> 05:28.344
I'm really not sure.

05:28.345 --> 05:31.104
Uh, so many people come
through here everyday.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.152
Look again.

05:33.153 --> 05:36.291
And keep in mind, this is
a murder investigation.

05:37.577 --> 05:39.258
I might have seen her a few times.

05:39.391 --> 05:41.101
What about two nights ago?

05:41.731 --> 05:43.320
Yes. Probably.

05:43.572 --> 05:45.055
Was she meeting someone?

05:47.512 --> 05:48.979
I'm gonna need a name.

05:48.996 --> 05:51.188
Look, our clients value their privacy.

05:51.189 --> 05:53.701
You're really putting me in
an awkward position here.

05:53.702 --> 05:55.301
Oh, you think this is awkward?

05:55.418 --> 05:57.091
Wait till I get a warrant
and start questioning

05:57.092 --> 05:59.511
all the people that have stayed
here over the past year.

05:59.512 --> 06:00.518
Fine.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.845
You didn't hear it from me.

06:09.705 --> 06:10.895
It can't be.

06:12.258 --> 06:15.667
Melanie was having an affair
with Senator Bracken.

06:28.223 --> 06:29.827
That's it. Esposito's confirmed it.

06:29.828 --> 06:31.216
The number that Melanie was calling

06:31.217 --> 06:33.567
was Senator Bracken's cell phone.

06:33.725 --> 06:35.925
Late-night phone calls,
secret hotel meetings--

06:35.926 --> 06:37.490
Bracken was having an affair with Melanie.

06:37.491 --> 06:39.060
She must have become a liability.

06:39.061 --> 06:41.678
Or she stumbled on to something
that he was involved in

06:41.679 --> 06:42.887
and became a threat.

06:42.888 --> 06:43.861
So he dealt with her

06:43.862 --> 06:44.959
the same way he dealt with your mother

06:44.960 --> 06:46.254
and tried to deal with you.

06:47.186 --> 06:48.625
This is it, Castle.

06:49.391 --> 06:52.028
This is my chance to finally make him pay.

06:52.029 --> 06:53.899
Yeah, but we have to be cautious.

06:53.904 --> 06:55.674
We know what happens to
people who go after him.

06:55.675 --> 06:57.870
Except this time, he doesn't
know we're on to him.

06:57.871 --> 06:59.450
We've got the advantage here.

07:00.122 --> 07:01.181
Do we?

07:01.301 --> 07:03.542
What do you think he's gonna
do when he sees you coming?

07:10.777 --> 07:12.365
How many people you think this
bastard put in the ground

07:12.366 --> 07:13.283
to get here?

07:13.284 --> 07:14.379
Hey, remember, we're only here

07:14.380 --> 07:16.041
to see if he can help us locate Melanie.

07:16.042 --> 07:17.090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:17.108 --> 07:18.400
Let him think he got away with it,

07:18.401 --> 07:20.025
just like he does everything else.

07:20.650 --> 07:23.482
You know, I was really hoping
the next time I saw this guy

07:23.483 --> 07:25.089
it would be down the barrel of my gun.

07:28.986 --> 07:30.634
You're sure I can't change your mind?

07:30.871 --> 07:33.152
I could really use your
help on this one, bill.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.283
I would if I could. You know that.

07:35.451 --> 07:38.080
You also know how important
this legislation is to me.

07:38.086 --> 07:39.198
Senator.

07:39.310 --> 07:40.774
Some detectives are here to see you.

07:40.775 --> 07:42.254
Sorry to trouble you, senator.

07:42.458 --> 07:43.855
This won't take long.

07:44.010 --> 07:45.645
What's this about, bill?

07:45.662 --> 07:46.873
I'm not sure.

07:48.291 --> 07:49.572
You look familiar.

07:50.735 --> 07:51.977
Have we met?

07:52.470 --> 07:53.776
I don't think so, sir.

07:54.247 --> 07:55.728
Is there someplace we can talk?

07:56.657 --> 07:57.755
I'd offer you both a drink,

07:57.756 --> 07:59.848
but I get the feeling
this is an official call.

08:00.285 --> 08:02.094
Well, we'd just like to
ask you a few questions

08:02.095 --> 08:03.208
about someone.

08:03.974 --> 08:05.218
Melanie Rogers.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.254
Yeah, sure. I know Melanie.

08:07.255 --> 08:08.953
She's a great girl. Is there a problem?

08:08.954 --> 08:10.844
She's--she's missing.

08:10.845 --> 08:12.023
Since yesterday.

08:12.046 --> 08:13.244
She's missing?

08:13.857 --> 08:15.916
That's terrible. Whatever
I can do to help.

08:15.919 --> 08:17.741
When was the last time you saw Ms. Rogers?

08:17.742 --> 08:18.996
Just yesterday. We were both attending

08:18.997 --> 08:20.803
the same eco conference in the city.

08:20.825 --> 08:23.515
Oh, so you ran into her there?

08:23.546 --> 08:25.840
No. I'm, uh, giving the keynote address,

08:25.841 --> 08:27.911
and she was helping me with my speech.

08:27.912 --> 08:29.252
Oh, so she works for you.

08:29.253 --> 08:31.039
Not exactly. She agreed to consult with me

08:31.040 --> 08:32.581
on a very important piece of legislation

08:32.582 --> 08:34.001
that I'm unveiling.

08:34.149 --> 08:36.578
So she's a non-paid consultant?

08:38.953 --> 08:40.549
I suppose.

08:41.698 --> 08:42.937
Why?

08:43.203 --> 08:45.198
It's just that you were seen
at the Standish Hotel together

08:45.199 --> 08:46.494
two nights ago.

08:46.933 --> 08:48.168
What are you implying?

08:48.169 --> 08:49.617
We're just trying to establish a timeline

08:49.618 --> 08:50.608
of Melanie's whereabouts.

08:50.609 --> 08:51.306
The hell you are.

08:51.307 --> 08:52.895
You're trying to take a
professional relationship

08:52.896 --> 08:53.903
and use it against me.

08:53.904 --> 08:55.841
Look, man. We're not
trying to jam you up--

08:55.842 --> 08:57.206
I know where I've seen you.

08:59.305 --> 09:01.189
You work with detective Beckett.

09:05.238 --> 09:06.841
We just have a few more questions.

09:07.341 --> 09:08.843
Then call my lawyer.

09:11.739 --> 09:12.813
The guy's guilty as hell,

09:12.814 --> 09:14.809
but he has an alibi.

09:14.908 --> 09:16.724
He was at some conference all day.

09:16.780 --> 09:18.119
Ryan's checking it out now.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.310
It's gonna check out.

09:19.311 --> 09:20.623
He never does this on his own.

09:20.624 --> 09:22.044
He always sends someone else.

09:22.045 --> 09:23.552
Okay, okay, so...

09:24.083 --> 09:25.689
now not only do we have
to find this killer,

09:25.690 --> 09:27.167
but we have to connect him to Bracken.

09:27.168 --> 09:28.804
Except we have no idea
where to start looking.

09:28.805 --> 09:30.015
We don't even have a real crime scene.

09:30.016 --> 09:31.570
No, but we're getting closer.

09:32.181 --> 09:35.371
The FBI performed an analysis
of Melanie's voice mail.

09:35.372 --> 09:37.334
It was a call made from a parking garage

09:37.335 --> 09:38.500
where she was abducted.

09:38.501 --> 09:39.962
They identified the background noise

09:39.963 --> 09:44.363
as the hydraulic motor
of a tc5015 tower crane.

09:44.364 --> 09:46.008
Tower cranes are used
in heavy construction.

09:46.009 --> 09:47.846
Which means the garage is
near a construction site.

09:47.847 --> 09:49.197
And only 12 sites in the city...

09:49.198 --> 09:50.831
are currently using that crane.

09:51.087 --> 09:54.201
Hey. So Bracken's alibi checked out.

09:54.299 --> 09:56.331
Witnesses put him at the
Goldman ecological conference

09:56.332 --> 09:57.617
all afternoon yesterday.

09:57.618 --> 09:59.388
They also confirmed
that Melanie was there,

09:59.389 --> 10:00.386
just like he said.

10:00.387 --> 10:01.897
She was seen leaving at 3:45.

10:01.898 --> 10:04.295
Melanie left the voice mail
from the parking garage

10:04.518 --> 10:05.769
at 4:00.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.575
Where was that conference being held?

10:07.576 --> 10:08.951
At the Widmark Hotel downtown.

10:08.952 --> 10:12.948
The Widmark-- that's five blocks
from that construction site.

10:16.608 --> 10:18.690
Which is right next to a parking garage.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.434
Hey, Beckett.

10:35.550 --> 10:36.951
You need to see this.

10:38.076 --> 10:38.951
X-t-3.

10:38.952 --> 10:40.611
Just like in Melanie's voice mail.

10:40.612 --> 10:41.818
Did you run the plates?

10:41.912 --> 10:45.038
Yeah. Just came back stolen.
Reported four days ago.

10:45.039 --> 10:46.139
All right. You guys check inside.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.351
Espo, pop that trunk.

11:06.812 --> 11:07.422
I may be wrong,

11:07.423 --> 11:08.956
but that looks like a sniper rifle.

11:08.957 --> 11:10.230
You wouldn't be wrong.

11:10.333 --> 11:14.091
Yo. Widmark Hotel. That's
where that conference is.

11:14.092 --> 11:15.546
Didn't Bracken say he was
giving a speech there

11:15.547 --> 11:16.643
in a couple of days?

11:21.889 --> 11:23.695
<i>I don't think Bracken's our killer.</i>

11:28.473 --> 11:29.608
He isn't.

11:33.124 --> 11:34.440
He's the target.

11:42.394 --> 11:44.040
Based on what we found in the car,

11:44.041 --> 11:46.422
someone was planning on
shooting the senator

11:46.423 --> 11:48.028
at the eco conference tomorrow night

11:48.029 --> 11:50.015
while he delivers his keynote speech.

11:50.016 --> 11:52.180
And if our suspect is still out there,

11:52.181 --> 11:53.478
he's still a threat.

11:53.509 --> 11:55.485
Did we get any prints off that duffel bag?

11:55.486 --> 11:56.286
Uh, not yet, sir.

11:56.287 --> 11:58.476
C.S.U. is still dusting
the car, the notebook,

11:58.477 --> 11:59.482
and everything else in the bag,

11:59.483 --> 12:00.786
including the rifle.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.793
Now we have serial numbers on the rifle,

12:02.794 --> 12:04.078
and we're looking into those.

12:04.079 --> 12:05.238
And our victim?

12:05.310 --> 12:07.490
How did Melanie Rogers
get mixed up in this?

12:07.491 --> 12:10.095
Somehow she stumbled upon his
plot, and he killed her.

12:10.096 --> 12:12.272
Oh, excuse me.

12:12.932 --> 12:13.992
It's the mayor.

12:13.993 --> 12:15.519
Keep me posted.
Mm-hmm.

12:15.885 --> 12:18.263
We might have a description
of our potential shooter.

12:18.527 --> 12:19.965
Widmark security stopped someone from

12:19.966 --> 12:22.146
getting into the conference
without proper credentials.

12:22.147 --> 12:22.719
When?

12:22.720 --> 12:25.394
Two days ago. A Caucasian, baseball cap,

12:25.395 --> 12:27.168
beard, long stringy hair,

12:27.169 --> 12:29.126
and he was carrying a
large gray duffel bag,

12:29.127 --> 12:30.816
just like that one.
What time?

12:30.817 --> 12:32.755
They said it was about 3:45 P.M.

12:32.756 --> 12:34.117
That's when Melanie left the conference.

12:34.118 --> 12:36.209
In her message, she said
something wasn't right.

12:36.210 --> 12:38.244
What if she saw this guy and
followed him to the garage?

12:38.245 --> 12:40.057
All right. Grab Espo and a sketch artist.

12:40.058 --> 12:42.076
Go down, talk to security at the Widmark.

12:42.077 --> 12:44.950
I want a picture of this guy in
circulation within the hour.

12:44.951 --> 12:45.972
Yeah.

12:47.630 --> 12:48.792
Kate.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.076
I was finally gonna put
this guy away, Castle.

13:04.031 --> 13:06.546
And now I'm protecting the
man that murdered my mother.

13:08.511 --> 13:09.947
Senator, we can provide you

13:09.948 --> 13:11.878
with an increased security detail.

13:11.879 --> 13:13.977
But until we apprehend this man,

13:14.736 --> 13:17.209
I'd recommend you postpone your speech.

13:17.258 --> 13:18.962
Is that really necessary?

13:19.532 --> 13:21.756
I mean, isn't the threat
all but neutralized?

13:21.757 --> 13:23.593
But we haven't stopped him.

13:24.086 --> 13:26.326
Look, we're talking about
someone that is ruthless,

13:26.327 --> 13:27.774
methodical.

13:27.923 --> 13:30.014
Someone that killed Melanie Rogers

13:30.015 --> 13:31.953
just to keep her from talking.

13:32.384 --> 13:35.358
That suggests a person that is
intent on seeing this through.

13:35.359 --> 13:36.324
Yes, but you just said

13:36.325 --> 13:38.053
you could increase his security detail.

13:38.054 --> 13:41.699
Look, this isn't just any conference.

13:42.302 --> 13:43.817
The senator is going to unveil

13:43.818 --> 13:45.677
a far-reaching environmental initiative

13:45.678 --> 13:47.940
that is the cornerstone of his term.

13:47.941 --> 13:50.399
We have issued dozens
of press credentials--

13:50.400 --> 13:53.795
Senator, I cannot guarantee your safety.

13:55.818 --> 13:57.650
I'm speaking at that conference.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.329
This keynote address

14:00.761 --> 14:02.571
puts me on the national stage.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.512
I'm not going to run and hide

14:04.513 --> 14:06.972
just because some wacko with a notebook

14:06.973 --> 14:08.354
made a threat.

14:08.907 --> 14:10.820
Now I suggest that you
people do whatever it takes

14:10.821 --> 14:12.015
to stop this man.

14:12.016 --> 14:12.881
Thank you.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.162
Very well, senator.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.640
Detective Beckett will
need a moment with you.

14:17.974 --> 14:19.072
Why?

14:20.946 --> 14:23.265
Because she's leading the investigation.

14:28.602 --> 14:29.712
Is there some reason why

14:29.713 --> 14:31.837
you don't want to work
with detective Beckett?

14:39.621 --> 14:42.492
Let's find somewhere private,
shall we, detective?

14:58.641 --> 14:59.519
Well...

15:02.183 --> 15:05.274
hard to miss the irony of this situation.

15:08.453 --> 15:11.243
Senator Bracken, do you have any enemies?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.280
Is there anyone that you can think of

15:13.281 --> 15:15.406
that would like to kill you?

15:17.678 --> 15:19.596
I get threatening letters
and e-mails all the time.

15:19.597 --> 15:21.020
Comes with the office.

15:21.497 --> 15:23.247
Mm.
My chief of staff keeps a file.

15:23.442 --> 15:25.385
Anyone with a legitimate claim?

15:25.709 --> 15:26.966
A man doesn't get to my position

15:26.967 --> 15:29.258
without upsetting people along the way.

15:29.541 --> 15:31.602
Most of them aren't crazy enough

15:31.603 --> 15:33.523
to want to try to kill me,

15:34.624 --> 15:36.788
present company excluded.

15:37.783 --> 15:38.989
You know, senator...

15:40.214 --> 15:43.496
I'm not the one that you should
be worried about right now.

15:46.476 --> 15:48.705
It's just us here, detective.

15:49.911 --> 15:52.300
A shooter on the loose,

15:52.694 --> 15:54.772
me in the crosshairs...

15:55.903 --> 15:58.198
must be a dream come true for you.

15:58.812 --> 15:59.921
In my dreams,

15:59.922 --> 16:02.673
I'm the one that gets to pull the trigger.

16:04.892 --> 16:05.582
But you know what?

16:05.583 --> 16:08.434
If you're not comfortable with
me leading this investigation,

16:08.435 --> 16:11.501
you're welcome to step outside
and tell everyone why.

16:18.104 --> 16:20.398
Well, then I guess we're
stuck with each other.

16:21.683 --> 16:23.804
So then let me make one thing clear.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.314
This man killed Melanie Rogers,

16:26.315 --> 16:28.219
and when someone commits murder,

16:28.277 --> 16:31.224
whoever he is, senator,

16:32.353 --> 16:34.543
I will bring him to justice,

16:35.123 --> 16:37.197
no matter how long it takes.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.626
I'll have my chief of staff
send over the letters.

16:59.156 --> 17:01.240
I'll tell you something, if I'm her,

17:01.241 --> 17:03.031
I sit in there shuffling
papers till whoever it is

17:03.032 --> 17:05.007
puts a bullet in Bracken's head.

17:05.742 --> 17:06.969
No, you wouldn't,

17:07.597 --> 17:09.517
'cause that would make you
no better than he is.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.872
The guy murdered Beckett's mother,

17:12.737 --> 17:14.050
captain Montgomery,

17:14.455 --> 17:15.696
who knows who else.

17:15.748 --> 17:17.938
Bracken's got it coming to
him, so I say, let it come.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.944
Mayor's asking for an update.
What's the latest?

17:23.175 --> 17:24.262
The serial number on that rifle

17:24.263 --> 17:26.608
led us to a hunting store
in Paterson, New Jersey.

17:26.619 --> 17:28.868
The owner I.D.'ed our
suspect from the sketch.

17:28.869 --> 17:31.574
The paperwork indicates that
several firearms were purchased,

17:31.575 --> 17:33.573
but the name and address are all bogus.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.902
Okay, take a few unis to canvass the area

17:35.903 --> 17:36.784
near the store

17:36.785 --> 17:38.508
and take the sketch of our suspect.

17:38.632 --> 17:39.624
All right.

17:39.832 --> 17:41.293
Detective Esposito.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.369
Any word from C.S.U.?
Yes, sir.

17:43.370 --> 17:44.881
They discovered part of a receipt

17:44.882 --> 17:46.522
with a smudge on it in the duffel bag.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.421
They're trying to get a
partial print off of that.

17:48.422 --> 17:50.544
Now there's no point of
sale on the receipt,

17:50.545 --> 17:52.606
but the SKU number matched that hat.

17:52.607 --> 17:53.720
The manufacturer's sending over

17:53.721 --> 17:55.471
a list of outlets in the tristate area,

17:55.472 --> 17:57.023
but there's over 200 locations.

17:57.024 --> 17:58.948
Focus on the ones in Jersey first.

17:59.006 --> 18:01.006
24 hours before Bracken speaks--

18:01.007 --> 18:02.355
Maybe Beckett will have better luck

18:02.356 --> 18:03.822
with those threat letters.

18:04.947 --> 18:06.618
Man, these people need to get a life.

18:06.725 --> 18:09.044
Most of these guys, it seems
their only companionship

18:09.045 --> 18:10.131
is the space alien

18:10.132 --> 18:12.034
that talks to them
through their microwave.

18:12.035 --> 18:13.347
Yeah, well, there's a lot of lonely

18:13.348 --> 18:15.776
and confused people out there.

18:15.850 --> 18:17.590
But so far, none of the letters

18:17.591 --> 18:20.451
match the handwriting in
our suspect's notebook.

18:20.553 --> 18:22.236
Considering what he's capable of,

18:22.237 --> 18:25.800
you would think Bracken would
have more formidable enemies.

18:25.801 --> 18:28.119
Oh, obviously, you never saw
the letter that I sent him.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.945
No, I did, actually. I
liked the way you, uh,

18:29.946 --> 18:31.941
dotted the "I" on "kill"
with a little heart.

18:31.942 --> 18:32.651
It was a nice touch.

18:32.652 --> 18:35.343
Well, I was trying to give it
a personal feel. Well done.

18:41.455 --> 18:43.213
So we're really not gonna talk about this?

18:43.817 --> 18:45.440
I mean, Castle, what is
there to talk about?

18:45.441 --> 18:47.730
Honestly? Practically everything.

18:47.731 --> 18:50.767
Which is why all I can do is
treat it like another case,

18:51.121 --> 18:52.742
'cause that's what it is. It's...

18:54.004 --> 18:55.773
just like any other case.

19:01.581 --> 19:02.756
You're tired, Castle.

19:02.757 --> 19:03.853
Why don't you go get some rest?

19:03.854 --> 19:05.528
No, no, no, I can stay if you like.

19:05.529 --> 19:06.758
No, come on.
Go.

19:06.977 --> 19:08.748
I'll call you if I need anything, okay?

19:14.506 --> 19:16.871
You really are remarkable, you know that?

19:49.752 --> 19:50.856
I'm working on this case

19:50.857 --> 19:52.948
where I need to find a suspect,

19:54.191 --> 19:56.213
and I came across a piece of evidence.

19:57.094 --> 19:59.009
It's a letter that he wrote.

19:59.010 --> 20:02.260
And there's no address, there's no name,

20:02.956 --> 20:05.268
just a postmark from New Jersey.

20:07.729 --> 20:10.868
And I know in my gut that
this is our big break.

20:11.728 --> 20:14.540
One way or another, it's gonna
lead us straight to him.

20:15.738 --> 20:17.814
Yet, here you are talking to me.

20:19.885 --> 20:24.356
If we find this suspect,
then someone worse,

20:24.728 --> 20:28.096
much worse, is going to escape justice.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.931
I take it no one else
knows about the letter.

20:30.932 --> 20:32.623
No, not yet.

20:32.704 --> 20:34.399
Well, as a police officer,

20:34.592 --> 20:37.400
you must have faced similar dilemmas.

20:37.617 --> 20:38.634
Yeah.

20:39.931 --> 20:41.629
Why is this time different?

20:42.488 --> 20:43.962
Because this time, it feels like

20:43.963 --> 20:45.616
there's no right choice.

20:47.254 --> 20:48.893
Maybe the right choice

20:49.464 --> 20:51.313
is the one you can live with.

21:10.759 --> 21:12.469
Hey, you guys seen Beckett?

21:12.470 --> 21:14.616
No. Uh, not since last night.

21:14.617 --> 21:15.637
We thought she was with you.

21:15.638 --> 21:17.134
No, I tried her a couple
of times this morning,

21:17.135 --> 21:17.930
but she wasn't picking up.

21:17.931 --> 21:19.044
All right. Thanks.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.337
Yo. I'm trying to get through

21:20.338 --> 21:22.541
this list of stores that
sell the baseball caps.

21:22.542 --> 21:23.887
Half of 'em aren't even open yet.

21:23.888 --> 21:24.625
What about you?

21:24.626 --> 21:27.136
Nada. The canvass around the
gun store turned up empty.

21:28.056 --> 21:28.801
Hey.

21:29.136 --> 21:29.898
Hey.

21:29.899 --> 21:32.208
You guys, where are we on the suspect?

21:32.209 --> 21:33.149
Nowhere.

21:33.150 --> 21:35.162
And Senator Bracken speaks
in less than ten hours.

21:35.163 --> 21:36.563
You find anything in those letters?

21:36.795 --> 21:39.548
Uh, no. Nothing significant.

21:40.499 --> 21:41.424
You doing all right?

21:42.344 --> 21:43.359
I need a second.

22:25.897 --> 22:26.663
You guys...
Yo.

22:26.664 --> 22:28.665
There's something that I--
I just heard back from C.S.U.

22:28.666 --> 22:30.344
on that receipt from the duffel bag.

22:30.345 --> 22:31.442
They get a print off that smudge?

22:31.443 --> 22:32.422
No, but it contained traces

22:32.423 --> 22:34.481
of synthetic motor oil
and brake pad residue.

22:34.482 --> 22:35.654
Sounds like our guy's a mechanic.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.820
So then maybe he was shopping
for the rifle near work.

22:37.821 --> 22:38.884
Where's that store again?

22:38.885 --> 22:40.085
Paterson, just off the highway.

22:40.086 --> 22:40.722
It's a place to start.

22:40.723 --> 22:43.135
All right, I'm gonna get you
guys addresses on your way.

22:43.136 --> 22:45.399
I'll compile a list of
every service station

22:45.400 --> 22:46.840
within a 5-mile radius,

22:46.841 --> 22:48.376
and we'll expand from there.

22:49.472 --> 22:50.649
Were you gonna say something?

22:50.923 --> 22:52.137
No. We're past it.

22:56.030 --> 22:58.868
Who new Paterson had so
many service stations, huh?

22:58.869 --> 23:00.077
I'm pretty sure we left Paterson

23:00.078 --> 23:01.355
five shops ago.

23:01.727 --> 23:03.638
Ugh. Back in 20 minutes.

23:03.639 --> 23:05.101
Well, we don't have 20 minutes to waste.

23:05.102 --> 23:07.199
Let's move on to the next on.
We'll circle back around.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.818
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

23:09.219 --> 23:10.907
Hey, look on top of the counter.

23:10.908 --> 23:12.133
They sell those hats here.

23:14.696 --> 23:16.311
Open up! Police business!

23:17.877 --> 23:19.755
All right! I'm coming! Relax.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.715
Don't break my glass.

23:21.716 --> 23:22.619
Yeah, I see it.

23:23.332 --> 23:24.318
What?
How you doing?

23:24.319 --> 23:26.717
NYPD. You know this guy?

23:28.812 --> 23:29.529
Maybe.

23:29.955 --> 23:31.621
He looks like one of my mechanics.

23:31.622 --> 23:32.212
I mean, he used to be.

23:32.213 --> 23:33.718
I laid him off, like, three weeks ago.

23:33.719 --> 23:35.035
Do you have any paperwork
he might have filled out?

23:35.036 --> 23:36.322
Maybe a work order?

23:36.778 --> 23:38.099
I might have something back here.

23:46.211 --> 23:47.388
Yeah, that's it right there.

23:51.679 --> 23:53.800
Handwriting's a match. It's our guy.

23:54.331 --> 23:57.120
Robert McManus has a
history of schizophrenia

23:57.121 --> 23:58.970
multiple stays at a psych ward,

23:59.326 --> 24:01.690
recent episodes were triggered
by his son's death.

24:02.433 --> 24:03.134
Hey.

24:04.191 --> 24:05.704
Hey, where are we on deployment?

24:05.705 --> 24:07.628
Every beat cop in the city has his photo.

24:07.629 --> 24:09.065
S.W.A.T.'s sitting on his place in Jersey,

24:09.066 --> 24:10.505
but his neighbors say he
hasn't been there in a month.

24:10.506 --> 24:11.924
He disappears for long stretches.

24:11.925 --> 24:13.322
We're scouring through his financials,

24:13.323 --> 24:15.455
but they are severely outdated.

24:15.456 --> 24:17.153
The guy closed his accounts years ago.

24:17.154 --> 24:18.611
Basically living off the grid.

24:18.612 --> 24:19.559
Got something.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.072
We canvassed near a diner
McManus used to frequent.

24:22.073 --> 24:24.443
An S.R.O. desk clerk just I.D.'ed him.

24:24.444 --> 24:26.109
He's been staying there a month.

24:36.312 --> 24:37.039
NYPD!

24:37.040 --> 24:38.712
NYPD! Don't move!

24:39.918 --> 24:40.673
Clear!

24:42.061 --> 24:42.737
Clear!

24:43.393 --> 24:43.968
Clear.

24:43.969 --> 24:44.814
Take the place apart.

24:44.815 --> 24:46.746
Look for anything that
might lead us to him.

24:46.747 --> 24:48.019
We should check the rest of the building.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.499
I'll talk to the manager for
details on his routine.

25:01.654 --> 25:03.496
NYPD. Show me your hands.

25:07.211 --> 25:07.829
Don't move.

25:07.830 --> 25:09.307
Don't move or I'll shoot!

25:36.612 --> 25:38.938
Hey. I just spoke to Ryan.

25:39.154 --> 25:40.904
McManus is still out there,

25:40.905 --> 25:42.589
but, uh, the boys are going door to door

25:42.590 --> 25:43.433
in every building nearby.

25:43.434 --> 25:45.702
I had him in my sights.

25:46.752 --> 25:47.804
I had him.

25:48.251 --> 25:50.564
So you missed. So what? It
could happen to anyone.

25:50.565 --> 25:51.365
No.

25:51.903 --> 25:53.113
I didn't miss.

25:54.613 --> 25:55.437
What do you mean?

26:00.470 --> 26:01.692
I found a letter...

26:02.885 --> 26:04.460
in the threats file.

26:06.030 --> 26:07.656
It was from McManus.

26:13.416 --> 26:15.083
How long have you known about this?

26:15.084 --> 26:16.201
Since last night.

26:16.994 --> 26:20.255
McManus was accusing Bracken
of murdering his son.

26:20.256 --> 26:22.215
I looked into it. He
was a 24-year-old kid.

26:22.216 --> 26:25.424
He was an intern for Bracken's
reelection campaign.

26:25.425 --> 26:27.390
He had a meeting scheduled
with a reporter,

26:27.391 --> 26:29.562
and the next day they found him hanged.

26:29.563 --> 26:30.776
And you think Bracken--

26:30.777 --> 26:32.850
I don't know, Castle.
My God.

26:34.556 --> 26:36.926
I almost suppressed evidence.

26:37.585 --> 26:39.053
I was gonna burn that letter.

26:39.054 --> 26:39.889
But you didn't.

26:39.890 --> 26:43.861
I didn't miss McManus.

26:44.781 --> 26:48.083
I looked him in the eye
and I saw his pain.

26:48.994 --> 26:50.760
And I couldn't take that shot.

26:51.862 --> 26:54.049
What if I wanted him to get away,

26:54.050 --> 26:56.478
wanted him to go through with this?

26:56.479 --> 26:58.059
Then what does that make me?

27:01.555 --> 27:02.589
Is there anything new?

27:02.856 --> 27:04.446
Nothing yet on McManus,

27:04.447 --> 27:06.382
but a search of his room turned up wires,

27:06.383 --> 27:08.303
a detonator, traces of c-4.

27:08.740 --> 27:10.497
It looks like he was building a bomb.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.811
A bomb?
Uh...

27:12.777 --> 27:14.007
Did anyone find it?

27:14.008 --> 27:15.803
No. If he built something,

27:15.804 --> 27:17.302
it's either with him

27:17.303 --> 27:19.415
or already out there waiting to go off.

27:23.952 --> 27:24.974
Beckett, hang on.

27:24.975 --> 27:26.657
He had a rifle, Castle.

27:26.658 --> 27:29.258
A rifle. Not a bomb.

27:29.259 --> 27:31.303
If he detonates that thing
tonight at the conference

27:31.304 --> 27:32.922
and innocent people get hurt--

27:32.923 --> 27:34.186
Okay, this is not your fault.

27:34.187 --> 27:36.502
How is it not my fault? I'm a cop.

27:36.503 --> 27:38.602
I had a job to do and I didn't do it.

27:38.603 --> 27:39.549
I've gotta make this right.

27:39.550 --> 27:41.953
I've gotta find that bomb
and save Bracken's life.

27:43.007 --> 27:44.408
Looks like you just got some help.

27:46.061 --> 27:48.326
Found him hiding on a
rooftop three blocks away.

27:48.327 --> 27:49.447
What about the bomb?

27:49.448 --> 27:51.459
Asked him about it. Asked him
about Melanie Rogers, too.

27:51.460 --> 27:52.495
He's not much of a talker.

27:52.496 --> 27:54.297
He hasn't said a word
since we picked him up.

27:55.157 --> 27:56.695
Take him to interrogation.

28:00.718 --> 28:02.478
What makes you think
he's gonna talk to you?

28:02.723 --> 28:03.505
'Cause...

28:04.249 --> 28:05.405
I know him.

28:11.095 --> 28:12.205
Hi, Robert.

28:13.769 --> 28:14.745
I'm Kate.

28:18.774 --> 28:20.118
Why don't you take those things off?

28:20.119 --> 28:21.435
They look uncomfortable.

28:31.271 --> 28:33.910
I know what it's like to
lose someone that you love,

28:35.520 --> 28:36.915
to live with that pain...

28:41.503 --> 28:42.767
to feel the rage

28:42.768 --> 28:45.464
towards the person responsible for it...

28:52.301 --> 28:53.636
towards Bracken.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.218
He took someone close to me.

29:03.752 --> 29:04.974
He killed my mother

29:05.934 --> 29:07.739
and then he went after my friends,

29:08.055 --> 29:09.440
even tried to kill me.

29:09.441 --> 29:11.106
Is she talking about Bracken?

29:11.107 --> 29:13.675
She's... just trying to get
through to him anyway you can.

29:19.201 --> 29:20.593
The man killed my son.

29:21.868 --> 29:22.821
No one cared.

29:23.079 --> 29:23.884
I care.

29:25.731 --> 29:26.786
He needs to pay.

29:27.102 --> 29:29.490
Not with a bomb, Robert.

29:30.890 --> 29:32.149
You and me, we're not like him.

29:32.150 --> 29:33.908
We don't hurt innocent people.

29:35.761 --> 29:37.145
Where's the c-4?

29:41.286 --> 29:42.888
You're trying to confuse me...

29:45.113 --> 29:46.169
or trick me...

29:46.970 --> 29:48.377
into saying something I shouldn't.

29:48.378 --> 29:49.992
I'm trying to take down Bracken,

29:49.993 --> 29:51.135
same as you.

29:51.136 --> 29:53.514
And we gotta do it in the right way.

29:53.515 --> 29:55.957
You and me are on the same side, Robert.

29:55.958 --> 29:57.248
You're on his side.

29:57.694 --> 29:59.080
He controls everybody.

29:59.487 --> 30:01.071
You're all in his pocket.

30:01.283 --> 30:03.557
Every last one of ya!

30:03.558 --> 30:06.456
No, I'm not. I'm just like you, Robert.

30:06.457 --> 30:07.650
She's losing him.

30:07.651 --> 30:09.195
You're not like me.

30:09.766 --> 30:12.882
You're making stuff up,
making up stories!

30:12.883 --> 30:14.547
If you went through what I went through,

30:14.548 --> 30:16.418
you would want to see him dead!

30:16.419 --> 30:19.736
Everything that I told you was true.

30:20.266 --> 30:21.369
Robert, look at me.

30:27.134 --> 30:28.872
Where is the c-4?

30:28.873 --> 30:31.415
If that thing goes off, then
there's blood on our hands,

30:31.416 --> 30:32.855
and I cannot live with that

30:32.856 --> 30:34.423
and I know that you can't either.

30:36.137 --> 30:37.924
Detective, a word.

30:37.925 --> 30:40.256
Sir.
Detective.

30:46.844 --> 30:48.856
Sir, I can do this. I can reach him.

30:48.857 --> 30:50.285
It's over, detective.

30:50.286 --> 30:51.348
Just give me another minute.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.214
I just got a call from the feds.

30:53.547 --> 30:54.712
They found the bomb.

30:56.579 --> 30:59.115
McManus rented a box at a post office.

30:59.116 --> 31:00.273
The c-4 was there.

31:00.274 --> 31:02.119
He'd wired it into a vest.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.868
He also obtained credentials
for the conference somehow.

31:04.869 --> 31:05.937
Well, thank you, captain,

31:05.938 --> 31:07.347
for everything you've done.

31:07.348 --> 31:09.139
Well, actually,

31:09.140 --> 31:11.253
detective Beckett deserves
most of the credit.

31:11.713 --> 31:12.769
She led the team.

31:14.883 --> 31:16.026
Excuse me, senator.

31:16.357 --> 31:18.117
Good afternoon, Mr. Mayor.

31:24.253 --> 31:26.005
I heard how you led the team.

31:27.495 --> 31:30.966
You fired, what, two
shots from close range

31:30.967 --> 31:32.751
and both of them missed?

31:34.709 --> 31:37.386
All this talk about justice...

31:38.343 --> 31:40.178
I guess I was right about you.

32:15.008 --> 32:16.382
Check this out.

32:17.638 --> 32:20.779
What better way to celebrate
the end of a difficult case

32:20.780 --> 32:22.748
than with a bottle of--

32:22.749 --> 32:24.979
What are you doing?

32:25.258 --> 32:26.953
Castle, look at this vest

32:26.954 --> 32:28.862
McManus supposedly made.

32:28.863 --> 32:30.757
The zip ties and the wires...

32:32.656 --> 32:34.544
they're expertly done.

32:35.961 --> 32:36.845
You saw McManus.

32:36.846 --> 32:39.278
He was barely able to
button his own shirt.

32:39.279 --> 32:40.582
In his current state, no.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.782
But he could've done this while
he was still on his meds.

32:42.783 --> 32:44.670
And what about Melanie's body?

32:44.671 --> 32:46.979
He burned it and then he
knocked out her teeth

32:46.980 --> 32:48.695
to keep it unidentifiable.

32:49.075 --> 32:51.807
And then he leaves a duffel bag
in a stolen car for us to find?

32:51.808 --> 32:53.237
That doesn't make any sense.

32:53.238 --> 32:54.385
Well, he's mentally ill.

32:54.386 --> 32:56.630
I mean, not everything he
does is going to make sense.

32:56.631 --> 32:59.440
No, Castle. Something is not right.

32:59.441 --> 33:02.067
That Zippo lighter that we heard
on Melanie's voice mail--

33:02.068 --> 33:03.240
McManus doesn't smoke.

33:03.241 --> 33:05.614
We didn't find a Zippo
in any of his things.

33:05.615 --> 33:06.442
Kate...

33:08.188 --> 33:09.106
let it go.

33:09.495 --> 33:11.799
I mean, you don't have anything
to prove, not to Bracken,

33:12.312 --> 33:13.739
not to me, not to yourself.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.313
Castle, this isn't about
proving something.

33:15.314 --> 33:16.891
This is about evidence.

33:16.892 --> 33:17.874
Well, all the evidence--

33:17.875 --> 33:19.514
the letter, the notebook, the bomb--

33:19.515 --> 33:21.302
everything traces back to McManus.

33:23.409 --> 33:25.265
What if somebody wanted us to find him?

33:25.266 --> 33:26.552
What if they're framing him

33:27.051 --> 33:29.222
so that everyone would think
that the threat was over

33:29.223 --> 33:31.335
while the real assassin
is still out there?

33:32.100 --> 33:33.676
The C-4 in the vest--

33:33.677 --> 33:35.942
What if that was the bomb
that we were supposed to find

33:35.943 --> 33:37.568
and there's another bomb
that's still out there,

33:37.569 --> 33:39.350
planned for the keynote address?

33:39.741 --> 33:41.365
That's an event whose time and place

33:41.366 --> 33:42.783
has been known for weeks.

33:44.666 --> 33:47.198
If a bomb went off
during Bracken's speech,

33:47.199 --> 33:48.497
they could say...

33:48.976 --> 33:51.133
McManus set it before he was apprehended.

33:51.134 --> 33:53.134
Bracken's supposed to go onstage at 8:00.

33:53.135 --> 33:54.918
That's 20 minutes away.

33:54.919 --> 33:56.754
Look, I know that I don't have any proof.

33:56.755 --> 33:58.384
I know that this sounds crazy--

33:58.385 --> 34:01.673
And you know how determined
Bracken was to give this speech.

34:01.674 --> 34:02.941
If you stop it and...

34:03.774 --> 34:04.583
you're wrong,

34:05.727 --> 34:07.179
your career is over.

34:07.180 --> 34:08.178
And if I'm right?

34:19.597 --> 34:22.161
This is detective Beckett.
Badge number 4-1-3-1-9.

34:22.163 --> 34:24.821
I'm calling for the evacuation
of the Widmark Hotel.

34:37.235 --> 34:38.235
Detective Beckett.

34:39.435 --> 34:40.893
Castle, why don't you see
if you can get an update

34:40.895 --> 34:41.864
from the bomb squad?

34:41.866 --> 34:42.590
Right.

34:43.252 --> 34:44.534
What the hell is going on here?

34:44.536 --> 34:46.087
Who called in the bomb squad?

34:46.088 --> 34:47.675
We had a credible threat, sir.

34:47.676 --> 34:49.485
Credible according to who?

34:51.391 --> 34:52.850
I think we should speak alone.

35:00.076 --> 35:01.581
We believe someone that you know

35:01.582 --> 35:02.810
is trying to kill you.

35:03.676 --> 35:04.430
What?

35:05.074 --> 35:07.413
You already have the man in custody.

35:07.414 --> 35:09.337
We believe McManus was set up

35:09.338 --> 35:11.285
because of the threatening
letter that he sent you,

35:11.286 --> 35:12.923
which means the individual involved

35:12.924 --> 35:15.387
has access to the files in your office.

35:15.388 --> 35:17.020
And you have evidence for all of this?

35:19.255 --> 35:20.142
You don't have evidence?

35:20.143 --> 35:22.368
Look, I'm not gonna make this
kind of accusation lightly.

35:22.369 --> 35:24.741
Are you--
So you called in a bomb scare based on--

35:24.742 --> 35:26.157
on--on what, a hunch?

35:26.558 --> 35:27.246
Beckett.

35:28.655 --> 35:29.447
We finished our search

35:29.448 --> 35:31.335
of the primary target area, detective.

35:31.336 --> 35:32.992
We found no explosive device.

35:32.993 --> 35:34.643
What about the stage? Did
you check the podium?

35:34.644 --> 35:36.423
We swept everything in a 50-foot radius

35:36.424 --> 35:37.888
of where the senator would be speaking.

35:37.889 --> 35:38.835
All right, well, this is ridiculous.

35:38.836 --> 35:41.209
Let's just get everybody back inside.

35:41.210 --> 35:42.853
I'm sorry, senator. We
still have to conduct

35:42.854 --> 35:44.626
a thorough search of the building.

35:44.627 --> 35:46.635
It's gonna take a few
more hours, I'm afraid.

35:50.068 --> 35:51.879
You think I don't know what you're doing?

35:51.880 --> 35:54.157
You let McManus get away so
that he would take me down,

35:54.158 --> 35:56.053
and when that didn't play
out, you decided to ruin

35:56.054 --> 35:58.246
the most important moment of my career.

35:58.247 --> 35:59.077
That's not what this is a--

35:59.078 --> 36:01.036
No, you save that for the review board.

36:01.962 --> 36:03.971
You have overplayed your hand,

36:04.427 --> 36:07.604
and I am going to bury you.

36:11.465 --> 36:13.499
Oh, God, Castle. I don't understand.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.087
How did we get this so wrong?

36:15.088 --> 36:16.167
We knew we were taking a risk.

36:16.168 --> 36:17.638
No, there's gotta be a reason

36:17.639 --> 36:19.534
that they were framing McManus.

36:19.535 --> 36:22.284
They had to have been planning
this for tonight, here.

36:22.285 --> 36:23.818
That's the only thing that makes sense.

36:23.819 --> 36:25.715
Or he wasn't being framed.

36:25.716 --> 36:27.643
Maybe they couldn't get
the bomb in the building.

36:27.644 --> 36:28.722
With the heightened security

36:28.723 --> 36:30.112
because McManus was on the loose,

36:30.113 --> 36:32.029
maybe they had to make a different plan.

36:32.030 --> 36:33.897
Place the bomb somewhere more accessible.

36:33.898 --> 36:34.643
Kate...

36:35.578 --> 36:36.382
It's over.

37:30.411 --> 37:31.181
Kate!

37:33.286 --> 37:34.040
Castle...

37:34.041 --> 37:34.987
The driver.

37:47.412 --> 37:48.422
Read him his rights.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.736
His name is Noah Charles.

37:54.737 --> 37:57.644
He was my driver for five years.

37:57.645 --> 37:59.890
Any reason why he'd
suddenly want you dead?

38:01.071 --> 38:04.050
I assume because someone paid
him a great deal of money.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.079
You don't seem shocked.

38:07.529 --> 38:09.473
There's another world
out there, Mr. Castle,

38:09.474 --> 38:11.285
one that most people don't see,

38:11.749 --> 38:14.207
run by money, influence, power.

38:14.644 --> 38:16.809
And the people in it will
do anything they can

38:16.810 --> 38:18.251
to stay on top.

38:20.404 --> 38:22.631
But I assume that you already know that.

38:25.515 --> 38:27.603
I wouldn't have done it, you know,

38:27.604 --> 38:28.431
what she did.

38:30.313 --> 38:31.599
I'd have stood and watched.

38:35.501 --> 38:37.099
So he's not talking.

38:37.665 --> 38:40.518
But a search of his apartment
turned up a pair of gloves

38:40.519 --> 38:43.320
with traces of Melanie
Rogers' blood on it.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.558
They also found a fake
beard and a baseball cap

38:45.559 --> 38:46.989
just like McManus'.

38:46.990 --> 38:49.520
So McManus could be seen at
the conference by security.

38:49.521 --> 38:50.699
It's all part of the setup.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.932
Melanie met Noah a bunch of times.

38:52.933 --> 38:55.063
She probably recognized him on the day,

38:55.064 --> 38:56.260
wondered what he was doing,

38:56.261 --> 38:58.408
and followed him.

38:58.409 --> 38:59.298
If she got on to him,

38:59.299 --> 39:01.233
he would've had no choice but to kill her.

39:01.234 --> 39:02.128
What a shame.

39:04.906 --> 39:06.235
She was a sweet kid.

39:09.277 --> 39:10.988
Hey, got a sec?

39:11.240 --> 39:11.895
Yeah.

39:13.396 --> 39:16.124
We did a little digging
into that driver of yours.

39:16.125 --> 39:19.121
Turns out you're not his
only employer, senator.

39:19.122 --> 39:20.680
We took a look into his financials.

39:20.681 --> 39:21.987
There's a series of large deposits

39:21.988 --> 39:23.320
made into his checking account.

39:23.321 --> 39:24.242
Let me guess.

39:24.243 --> 39:26.955
Untraceable wire transfers
bounced through shadow accounts

39:26.956 --> 39:28.418
in Switzerland and the middle east.

39:28.419 --> 39:29.559
Just like you would've done.

39:33.285 --> 39:34.194
Thanks, guys.

39:37.759 --> 39:39.623
You know who's behind this, don't you?

39:39.624 --> 39:41.001
I have my suspicions.

39:41.002 --> 39:41.717
Who?

39:42.445 --> 39:43.778
Someone who's gotten rich

39:43.779 --> 39:45.924
making powerful people promises

39:45.925 --> 39:47.815
that I needed to keep.

39:47.816 --> 39:49.102
What does a kingmaker do

39:49.762 --> 39:51.876
when the king no longer follows orders?

39:52.404 --> 39:53.353
I need a name.

39:54.021 --> 39:55.242
You've done enough, detective.

39:55.243 --> 39:56.922
Senator, that person is still out there,

39:56.923 --> 39:58.814
and I have no way of getting to him.

39:59.950 --> 40:01.233
You're not safe.

40:02.575 --> 40:04.401
I'm touched by your concern,

40:04.402 --> 40:06.836
but I think maybe you forget
who you're dealing with.

40:08.211 --> 40:09.401
Sir, we have to leave.

40:09.402 --> 40:11.082
You're already 30 minutes behind schedule.

40:12.092 --> 40:14.383
Detective Beckett, would
you, uh, walk me out?

40:30.576 --> 40:31.959
You saved my life.

40:32.755 --> 40:34.475
Yeah, well, you can't
win 'em all, can you?

40:35.681 --> 40:37.699
I suppose this means I'm in your debt.

40:39.002 --> 40:41.112
Nothing's changed between us, senator.

40:41.113 --> 40:41.989
Even so,

40:43.137 --> 40:45.346
it's a dangerous world
out there, detective.

40:46.704 --> 40:48.891
You never know when you
might need a friend.

40:53.003 --> 40:54.352
McManus' son...

40:56.763 --> 40:57.694
Was that you?

40:59.275 --> 41:00.324
If I said no,

41:01.135 --> 41:02.557
would you really believe me?

41:03.603 --> 41:04.821
There he is.
Senator!

41:04.822 --> 41:06.937
Senator Bracken! Senator Bracken!

41:06.938 --> 41:07.760
Senator. Senator!

41:07.761 --> 41:10.161
Is it true the attempt on
your life was an inside job?

41:10.162 --> 41:12.520
Witnesses say they arrested your driver.
Any comment?

41:12.521 --> 41:14.468
Did it have anything to do with
your environmental initiative?

41:14.469 --> 41:15.662
Look, the senator is very busy--

41:15.663 --> 41:17.981
No, th-that's okay.
I'll--I'll make a statement.

41:19.527 --> 41:20.503
As you all know, last night

41:20.504 --> 41:22.279
an attempt was made on my life.

41:22.887 --> 41:25.241
And though I was not able
to introduce my initiative

41:25.242 --> 41:26.766
at the eco conference,

41:27.221 --> 41:29.281
it has only strengthened my resolve

41:29.282 --> 41:33.091
to move forward with this
historic piece of legislation.

41:34.110 --> 41:35.885
And I would like to especially thank

41:35.886 --> 41:37.883
the brave men and women

41:37.884 --> 41:39.704
of the New York City police department,

41:40.242 --> 41:41.577
who thwarted this plot.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.436
And in a shocking development,

41:43.437 --> 41:45.466
federal agents arrested Benjamin Moss,

41:45.467 --> 41:48.039
founder of the powerful
Super PAC American way,

41:48.040 --> 41:49.728
after connecting him to payments made

41:49.729 --> 41:51.426
to the senator's would-be assassin.

41:51.427 --> 41:53.085
Moss, a former president...

41:53.392 --> 41:54.416
My God.

41:55.306 --> 41:56.566
It was Ben Moss.

41:56.567 --> 41:58.458
The biggest kingmaker of 'em all.

41:59.344 --> 42:01.703
But Bracken only had him arrested.

42:01.704 --> 42:03.602
The way he was talking,
I half expected the guy

42:03.603 --> 42:05.926
to die in a "plane crash"

42:05.927 --> 42:08.761
or some kind of mysterious...
"car accident."

42:08.762 --> 42:09.404
No.

42:09.405 --> 42:11.162
This is so much better.

42:11.557 --> 42:13.498
Now Bracken's a folk hero.

42:14.048 --> 42:15.181
The rare politician

42:15.182 --> 42:17.487
willing to stand up to special interests

42:17.488 --> 42:20.798
even if it costs him his life.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.591
You're right. That's a better story.

42:23.911 --> 42:24.432
The kind of story

42:24.433 --> 42:26.899
that could make a guy president.

42:27.373 --> 42:28.420
He'll slip up eventually,

42:28.445 --> 42:38.445
