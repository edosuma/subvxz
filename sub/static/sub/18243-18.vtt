she was a fry cook at

Wait. Noelle didn't cook
a single meal?

21:46.392 --> 21:47.784
I knew she was just
all talk.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.133
You're missing
the point, Jake.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.005
This rosemary must be
a magic spice

21:51.092 --> 21:53.181
that she uses in her
rosemary popovers.

21:53.268 --> 21:55.444
She spells her customers
to love her food.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.490
And the worst part is,
I really want
another one of those

21:57.577 --> 21:59.970
bland/amazing
grilled cheeses.

22:00.057 --> 22:03.060
This is definitely
RJ's book bag.

22:03.147 --> 22:05.193
And these are
all the spices
he stole from us.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.195
There's only one way
Noelle could have this.

22:07.282 --> 22:08.718
She must have
taken these from RJ

22:08.805 --> 22:10.024
after she cursed him.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.113
I was really
starting to like her.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.854
I can't believe
I fell for her act.

22:13.941 --> 22:16.030
What's important is that
you got out of there safe.

22:16.117 --> 22:18.032
Yeah,
she cursed her best friend
from high school,

22:18.119 --> 22:20.121
and she's spelling
half the town.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.297
Imagine what she'd have done
if she'd caught us.
