WEBVTT

00:10.511 --> 00:13.214
* Don't stop,
baby, keep on moving *

00:20.588 --> 00:24.325
* Just don't stop
and keep on groovin', ooh *

00:25.526 --> 00:28.062
*

00:28.096 --> 00:30.198
* Don't stop
till the break of dawn *

00:30.231 --> 00:32.133
* Don't stop, baby,
all night long *

00:32.166 --> 00:35.569
* You know
I ain't coming on *

00:35.603 --> 00:38.339
* Oh, babe,
should-a called the law... *

00:39.173 --> 00:41.475
Hey.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.811
You can't be back here
without clearance.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.616
What the hell are you doing?

01:01.162 --> 01:03.697
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:03.731 --> 01:06.367
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:06.400 --> 01:08.736
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:08.769 --> 01:10.104
* How, how, how, how

01:10.138 --> 01:12.273
* Hey, hey

01:18.212 --> 01:19.613
* You gotta come on.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.251
It's been over a week now,

01:23.284 --> 01:26.220
and Percy hasn't
returned one call.

01:26.254 --> 01:29.423
I told you something
was off, and you were all,

01:29.457 --> 01:33.227
"Pride says it's no big deal,
then it's no big deal."

01:33.261 --> 01:35.263
Plus, knowing Sonja,

01:35.296 --> 01:37.231
she's probably off getting
another certification

01:37.265 --> 01:40.601
in advanced forensic
techniques or...

01:40.634 --> 01:42.536
something else to make
us feel inadequate.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.338
Well, whatever it is,

01:44.372 --> 01:46.774
I think it's common courtesy
to return a text.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.376
The amount you text,

01:48.409 --> 01:49.910
I wouldn't be surprised
if she blocked you.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.213
What?!
Come on, you haven't
been blocked by a girl?

01:52.246 --> 01:53.747
I mean, I know
I've done it to guys.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.183
You ignore 'em
long enough,

01:55.216 --> 01:56.917
and eventually, the
creepers give up.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.519
I'm not a creeper,
I'm a co-worker.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.920
No, you're a
work-husband.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.223
Now, you coined that, not me.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.325
Chris Lasalle
doesn't get blocked.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.260
He does the blocking.
Hmm! Really!

02:06.294 --> 02:08.896
Our victim is
Chief Petty Officer Jim Tobin.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.300
I spoke to his CO.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.767
Young man had
a spotless record.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.304
Recently promoted
to construction manager,

02:16.337 --> 02:18.672
overseeing new drainage
and sewage piping on the base.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.341
What do you got, Loretta?

02:21.342 --> 02:22.510
The skewer here punctured

02:22.543 --> 02:24.445
through his subclavian artery,

02:24.478 --> 02:27.548
caused massive hemorrhaging,
blood loss.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.817
Took his final breath
shortly after.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.552
He has bruising
on his face

02:31.585 --> 02:34.355
and defensive wounds
on his hands.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.225
Suggests an altercation.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.892
PRIDE: And with the
rebar being what...

02:38.926 --> 02:41.662
eight, ten feet away
from the ledge up there,

02:41.695 --> 02:44.398
either he had a running start
before taking the plunge, or...

02:44.432 --> 02:45.466
Or he was pushed.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.201
LASALLE:
Check this out.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.502
It's a body camera.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.971
I wear one
when I go sport-fishing.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.873
You wear a camera fishing?

02:52.906 --> 02:55.309
When you come back after
catching a 300-pound marlin,

02:55.343 --> 02:58.679
you want footage of the battle,
show the grandkids.

02:58.712 --> 02:59.880
PRIDE: Huh.
Rebar must've knocked

02:59.913 --> 03:01.449
the camera off on impact.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.284
Hey, guys,
there's another camera up here,

03:03.317 --> 03:04.752
so if either one of 'em
was rolling...

03:04.785 --> 03:07.621
Whoever pushed
our Seabee might be on film.

03:07.655 --> 03:12.260
Problem with this one--
USB port's busted, no playback.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.728
If only we knew someone
who could fix it.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.664
So I'm working on
the trench cam now.

03:16.697 --> 03:20.568
These files are corrupt, but
I'm gonna salvage what I can.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.969
What do y'all think
about the Triple P mobile?

03:22.002 --> 03:23.504
Huh? He's been stashing

03:23.537 --> 03:24.905
his cash away for this.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.340
Portable mobile
command center.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.409
ATF has one.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.979
FBI, DEA has one.
I figured NCIS get one, too.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.282
Portable command center?

03:34.315 --> 03:36.250
This is more like
a man cave on wheels.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.852
What's this,
an entertainment system?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.354
PATTON:
That's a HD plasma screen.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.523
No, nope-- for business
purposes only.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.325
Hey, what about the full bar?

03:44.358 --> 03:45.793
Is that for
business purposes, too?

03:45.826 --> 03:47.828
I'm only human, man.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.498
We're up.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.468
TOBIN: Hey, can't be back here.
Oh, looky-looky.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.271
Someone took something
they shouldn't have.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.373
What's in his bag?

03:59.407 --> 04:01.609
What the hell are you doing?

04:01.642 --> 04:04.678
(blows thudding,
men grunting)

04:04.712 --> 04:06.414
Ooh.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.081
LASALLE: Oh.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.052
PRIDE:
Freeze it right there!

04:12.085 --> 04:13.854
Got you, sucka.

04:13.887 --> 04:17.057
Killer got that transpo van
onto a Navy construction site.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.726
Must have had an access card.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.762
Cards are dated and time-coded
when you enter the base.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.831
He's got to be in the system.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.368
PATTON: Jackpot.

04:27.401 --> 04:30.604
Julian Kaufman.
Pulling up his files now.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.606
LASALLE:
Runs a construction company

04:32.640 --> 04:35.075
out of Baton Rouge.
Contracted by the Navy

04:35.108 --> 04:37.778
six months back to help out on
this little maintenance project,

04:37.811 --> 04:39.813
but his access was restricted.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.782
Shouldn't have been back there
at that trailer.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.717
Yeah, I'm guessing
he owns a white van?

04:43.751 --> 04:45.052
PATTON:
He owns a whole fleet of 'em.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.420
All right, Brody, get NOPD

04:46.454 --> 04:47.988
to go to his residence.
Right.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.458
Patton, Lasalle, get me
the licenses on those vans.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.760
I want a BOLO out
on every last one of 'em.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.097
OFFICER: Suspect's vehicle
overturned in pursuit

04:57.130 --> 04:58.999
on Chef Menteur Highway.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.970
Louisiana State Police
heli spotted the van

05:03.003 --> 05:04.805
after we put out the APB.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.807
Troopers tried
to pull him over, he fled.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.443
Dead Man's Curve
claimed another victim.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.811
Yeah, apparently,

05:10.844 --> 05:13.414
he doesn't abide
by "click it or ticket."

05:15.048 --> 05:17.017
Well, let's see
what was worth

05:17.050 --> 05:18.819
killing our Seabee over.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.521
Looks like he already unpacked.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.394
Pride, Brody...
Explosive ordinances.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.631
Kaufman was stealing Navy TNT?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.768
Enough for a big...

05:34.802 --> 05:37.405
big boom.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.383
Our missing TNT.
Tell me things.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.719
Afraid we're looking for more
than what was just in that van.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.154
Kaufman was the site's
blasting expert.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.390
According to log-in records,

05:56.424 --> 05:59.126
the Navy construction inspector
was doubling orders of TNT

05:59.159 --> 06:01.462
at Kaufman's request for
three months running.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.096
Our poor Seabee
just caught him taking it,

06:03.130 --> 06:04.598
paid for it with his life.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.534
How much TNT
are we talking about?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.436
Well, I'll put it to you
this way:

06:08.469 --> 06:10.638
Timothy McVeigh used
the equivalent of 4,000 pounds

06:10.671 --> 06:12.440
in the Oklahoma City bombing.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.141
We're looking at
twice that much.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.109
Operation like that
requires manpower.

06:16.143 --> 06:19.079
We need to figure out
who the hell he's working with.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.615
Ooh, I got something
for y'all.
Talk to me.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.651
Man, I looked
into Kaufman's computer,

06:23.684 --> 06:26.720
and I found a membership
to Market Underground.

06:26.754 --> 06:29.490
This is your one-stop
shop for guns, drugs,

06:29.523 --> 06:30.458
and, in our case,
explosives.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.426
Oh... and guess who's

06:32.460 --> 06:34.895
been receiving
BitCoin deposits as of late.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.764
Kaufman.
Bingo, and it gets better.

06:36.797 --> 06:41.001
I traced it back
to a user named Triple-Z.

06:41.034 --> 06:44.137
No relation.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.739
I managed to dig up
their chat history, too.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.841
BRODY:
You guys, look at the dates.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.677
Every since Kaufman's
been stealing,

06:49.710 --> 06:51.211
he's been getting
a message every week,

06:51.244 --> 06:52.946
and he's responded
with "delivery set."

06:55.248 --> 06:57.017
Wade and Sebastian.
They got something.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.218
You all start looking

06:58.251 --> 07:00.721
into Kaufman's
last known whereabouts.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.023
Find me that delivery location.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.226
Ah, right on
time for lunch.

07:06.259 --> 07:11.064
I just extracted a delectable
meal from Mr. Kaufman's gut.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.766
Well, as good as that sounds,

07:12.800 --> 07:15.469
uh, I think I'll save
my appetite for R&O's.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.671
But still, I'd like to
know what you got.
This is from

07:17.705 --> 07:19.540
the fundus region
of the stomach.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.775
It's the area where
the undigested food is stored.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.244
So, judging by
the limited decomposition,

07:24.277 --> 07:26.680
it's safe to say
he had his last supper

07:26.714 --> 07:29.049
maybe an hour before
he flipped the car.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.184
So, we find out what he ate...

07:31.218 --> 07:33.253
Should be able to pinpoint
where he ate it.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.223
The meat is a garlic and
pork fat alligator s...

07:36.256 --> 07:38.258
ah... sausage.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.227
The bread is Wonder,
and the sauce,

07:40.260 --> 07:41.795
that was a bit of a challenge.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.263
I ran an online search
for the recipe.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.266
I found it on a foodie blog
run by a couple of hipsters,

07:46.299 --> 07:49.503
if that wasn't evident.
Anyway, they claim

07:49.537 --> 07:51.872
to have eaten at every
hole-in-the-wall in the bayou.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.274
And what hole-in-the-wall is
this particular sauce from?

07:54.307 --> 07:57.878
Mama Gator's Diner
off of Highway 90.

07:57.911 --> 08:01.014
(lively music playing
in distance)

08:01.048 --> 08:03.951
Now, is it just me,
or does it look like we stepped

08:03.984 --> 08:06.954
into a scene out of
Texas Chainsaw Massacre?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.722
Don't be so judgy, Brody.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.558
Look, see Leatherface
over there?

08:12.225 --> 08:13.927
Think he's got
the eyes for you.
Shut up.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.534
You Mama Gator?

08:20.568 --> 08:22.870
Yes, I am.
And y'all are?

08:22.903 --> 08:24.972
LASALLE:
Federal agents.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.174
Is this
about my hunting permits?

08:27.207 --> 08:28.976
I got them in on time.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.645
Every last bit of this
gator meat is harvest tagged.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.213
This isn't about gators,
all right?

08:33.246 --> 08:35.182
It's about him.
You seen him?

08:35.215 --> 08:37.618
Never in my life.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.756
What do we have here?

08:42.790 --> 08:45.058
BRODY:
I see you brought
your handy dandy

08:45.092 --> 08:46.594
TraceX kit.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.262
Pays to be prepared, Brody.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.999
Well, what are you doing? I know
my rights. You need a warrant.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.002
Not if contraband is
in plain view.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.173
I spy with my little eye

09:00.207 --> 09:03.777
what looks like...
explosive residue.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.646
BRODY: We'll give you
a couple of options.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.080
Either you talk, and maybe

09:07.114 --> 09:08.749
we can work out
some kind of a deal,

09:08.782 --> 09:10.150
or we'll take you in right now

09:10.183 --> 09:11.852
on conspiracy
to commit a terrorist act.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.290
That fella you showed me
came in here a few months back,

09:17.324 --> 09:20.360
offered me 2,000 bucks
to let him use my dock.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.663
Every week, he loads his crates.

09:22.696 --> 09:26.166
Threatened if I told anyone,
I'd be gator feed.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.701
Where do the crates
go from here?

09:27.735 --> 09:30.103
Boats pull up, take 'em away.

09:30.137 --> 09:33.173
Vanish into the Atchafalya.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.609
All we have to do now, Brody,
is find a boat

09:35.643 --> 09:38.846
in 250,000 acres
of coastal wetlands.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.981
SEBASTIAN:
Well, I think I found a way
to track our boat.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.817
Um, when a... when a vessel
travels a waterway,

09:43.851 --> 09:45.686
it leaves behind an oil trail.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.655
The more frequently it travels
a route, the bigger the trail.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.956
So, here's where we get

09:48.989 --> 09:50.624
all Mission: Impossible.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.694
I just need to enter in
the coordinates...

09:53.727 --> 09:55.328
of our little gator eatery.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.698
And...

09:57.731 --> 09:59.299
Yahtzee.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.069
All right, um, what direction
did Brody and Lasalle say

10:02.102 --> 10:03.671
the boat was travelling?
West.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.872
Okay, I just got to access

10:04.905 --> 10:06.406
the advanced
aperture settings here

10:06.439 --> 10:08.375
and zoom in
on the western basin.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.810
There's the oil trail.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.211
All right,
looks like we found

10:11.244 --> 10:12.913
the SS Minnow
at some kind of a...

10:12.946 --> 10:14.682
Fort.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.717
Confederate Army built
a whole bunch of 'em

10:16.750 --> 10:18.652
as part
of their seacoast defense plan.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.621
Go back to normal view and
zoom in at the end of the trail.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.359
That's-that's not tree cover.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.195
It's tarp cover.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.830
And whoever put it up

10:29.863 --> 10:31.398
doesn't want us seeing
what's underneath.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.166
We'll go check it out.
Let's check it out.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.335
You stay.
I'll stay here.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.370
It's a good, it's a good call.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.116
*

10:57.024 --> 10:58.458
Everybody down! Now!

10:58.491 --> 10:59.960
NCIS! On the ground!

11:03.496 --> 11:05.165
Coca leaves?

11:05.198 --> 11:06.666
MARSHAL: Right where you are!
Federal marshals!

11:08.068 --> 11:10.337
Pride, Brody. Over here!

11:10.370 --> 11:12.405
(agents and marshals
continue yelling)

11:19.179 --> 11:20.748
Well, we found
the explosives.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.216
They're dismantling it.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.721
Something tells me
they're not making bombs here.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.193
Because they're making cocaine.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.227
BRODY: They're getting away!

11:38.031 --> 11:40.433
Hands! Don't move!

11:40.467 --> 11:42.302
Requesting air support.
Got a male in a boat

11:42.335 --> 11:44.805
with contraband,
heading northbound.
Hands!

11:46.006 --> 11:47.474
Turn around, slow.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.342
Turn around!

12:08.461 --> 12:10.430
You come to me
a couple months back,

12:10.463 --> 12:12.199
something's gnawing at you,

12:12.232 --> 12:15.502
tell me all stories
about your old pal Marion.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.871
How she's dealing,

12:17.905 --> 12:19.306
you want to stop her.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.208
What did I tell you?
Get closure.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.211
I gave you the go-ahead
to surveil her stash house,

12:24.244 --> 12:26.847
consult the DEA.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.082
Then you don't return
my phone calls,

12:29.116 --> 12:31.084
go ten days
in radio silence

12:31.118 --> 12:32.986
and now I find you undercover?

12:33.020 --> 12:35.088
Pride, I wanted to keep you
in the loop, but...

12:35.122 --> 12:36.556
I wouldn't let her.
Why not?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.225
Got a leak in the Metropolitan
Narcotics Task Force.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.227
Been having to keep
all this under wraps.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.563
Think you two spoke over the
phone. This is Agent Banks.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.999
He's running point
on the investigation.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.534
Who the hell do
you think you are,

12:47.567 --> 12:50.537
keeping me out of the loop,
not following protocol?

12:50.570 --> 12:52.172
She's my agent!

12:54.441 --> 12:57.410
Now someone catch me up
on how this went

12:57.444 --> 13:00.147
from taking down
local dealer Marion Watkins

13:00.180 --> 13:02.249
to taking down
a distribution ring.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.083
Pride, they're one and the same.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.986
Marion's not
a little dealer anymore.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.321
We think she runs
this whole operation.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.992
An old CI from ATF put me in
with Marion's crew.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.027
You weren't worried about Marion
calling you out as a cop?

13:14.061 --> 13:15.262
Look, I never saw her.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.264
Pride, she's pulling
the strings.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.299
She's not showing her face.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.934
And even if we did cross paths,

13:20.968 --> 13:24.004
Marion and I have been out
of touch for over a decade.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.573
She doesn't even know
I have a badge.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.275
Pride,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.410
what were you guys
doing out here anyway?

13:30.443 --> 13:33.413
We had good reason to believe
this was a munitions plant.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.116
The toluene.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.851
It's a chemical they extract
from the TNT.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.853
They use it to wash
and purify cocaine.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.321
We've been wondering where
they've been getting it all.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.422
Now we know.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.324
Why produce cocaine stateside?

13:44.357 --> 13:46.393
Customs and Port Authority
got good at sniffing out

13:46.426 --> 13:49.296
refined product. Marion's group
figured out a work-around.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.299
Ship the leaves up instead.
Manufacture it right here.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.368
How much product's
coming out of this place?
Don't know. But there was

13:55.402 --> 13:58.238
more than 50 kilos on that boat.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.140
Turn a package that size around,
it'll be on the streets

14:00.173 --> 14:01.374
in 48 hours.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.243
We need to find that boat.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.245
Percy, you got
anything we can go on?
Well, I didn't get

14:05.278 --> 14:07.380
the driver's name,
but I've been with him all day.

14:07.414 --> 14:11.418
I got his face and smell
burned in my memory.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.454
I'll get a sketch artist.
We put a name to a face,

14:14.487 --> 14:17.157
we might find
who Marion's been working with.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.927
Banks, this is now
a joint operation.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.495
From here on in,
we share intel.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.331
Is that clear?

14:24.364 --> 14:26.433
Clear.

14:29.436 --> 14:34.174
Percy, when this is over...

14:34.207 --> 14:37.444
you and I have a lot
to talk about.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.481
SEBASTIAN:
This is one

14:41.514 --> 14:43.316
of the coca leaves taken
from the warehouse.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.085
I've been analyzing it,
trying to figure out

14:45.118 --> 14:46.954
where it came from.
Any luck?

14:46.987 --> 14:48.521
Well, not regarding
its origins.

14:48.555 --> 14:52.459
But I did find an odd pollen
trace on the leaf from...

14:52.492 --> 14:54.627
Cattleya trianae.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.229
An orchid?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.331
Rare, indigenous
to Colombia,

14:58.365 --> 15:00.333
which may seem like
a superfluous detail,

15:00.367 --> 15:03.937
if I hadn't also found traces
of sodium hypochlorite, AKA

15:03.971 --> 15:05.005
bleach.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.206
Florists use this

15:06.239 --> 15:07.674
as a preservative.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.179
These leaves passed
through a flower shop

15:12.212 --> 15:14.181
before making it out
to the warehouse.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.648
Any idea which one?
Yeah.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.650
So, there's only one store
in 100 miles

15:17.684 --> 15:20.420
that imports the volume
of Cattleya trianae

15:20.453 --> 15:23.390
that we're talking about.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.393
The Grand Florist
in Gretna.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.300
Help you with something?

15:33.333 --> 15:34.401
Yeah. Actually, um,

15:34.434 --> 15:37.404
you guys sell Cattleya flowers?

15:38.571 --> 15:39.706
It's an orchid.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.708
Never heard of it.

15:41.741 --> 15:45.078
Let me go ask my manager.
Thanks.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.413
Recognize that voice anywhere.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.151
Marion.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.987
What's up, Left Eye?

15:54.021 --> 15:55.622
No, I was T-Boz.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.991
You were Left-Eye.
Huh.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.692
You sure?
Yeah, my baby.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.995
I don't miss much
from the old days.

16:02.029 --> 16:05.365
Guess we all have different
interpretations of history.

16:06.599 --> 16:10.003
So, flowers, huh?

16:10.037 --> 16:11.538
It's a steady job.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.541
I manage the place.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.476
Who would've thought?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.211
What about you?

16:18.245 --> 16:20.013
What's your calling?

16:20.047 --> 16:21.681
Oh, um...

16:21.714 --> 16:23.683
social work.
Hmm.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.685
Drug addicts and teen moms, huh?

16:25.718 --> 16:28.555
Makin' up for sins of the past?

16:28.588 --> 16:31.558
Got nothin' to make up for.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.027
Course you don't.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.630
Orchids?
Yeah.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.467
You know, it's funny, actually.
A friend of mine...

16:40.500 --> 16:43.036
she can't do without 'em.
Mm-hmm.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.438
That's unfortunate.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.074
'Cause we're all out.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.575
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.644
Sorry about that.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.513
Listen, I gotta take off,

16:53.546 --> 16:56.116
but you do me a favor
and say hello to your folks

16:56.149 --> 16:58.285
for me, you hear?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.557
Force me to wait in the car,

17:04.591 --> 17:07.494
least you could've brought me
a bouquet of daffodils or...

17:07.527 --> 17:09.096
Oh, I got you one better.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.164
See that lady
that just pulled off?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.565
It's Marion.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.601
That'll do.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.736
The bag she put in the car
could be product.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.371
Stay on her.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.577
What you got?

17:24.611 --> 17:27.447
Agent Banks recognized
the man in Sonja's sketch,

17:27.480 --> 17:30.650
was able to put a name
to our missing boat captain.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.520
Nathan Litke. I've crossed
paths with him before.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.821
Works for a group
calls themselves

17:34.854 --> 17:37.157
the Bayou Drug Syndicate.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.525
That's Payton Kirk's
outfit, right?

17:38.558 --> 17:41.494
Used to run crystal meth
up and down I-10.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.163
Till state police shut him down.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.398
Impressive, Pride.
You worked Narcotics?

17:45.432 --> 17:49.302
No, Banks. Just been policing
this city over 25 years.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.105
Know all
the criminal entrepreneurs.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.873
BRODY: Well, apparently,
this criminal entrepreneur

17:53.906 --> 17:55.708
recently made a career change.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.577
Kirk adjusted
to the marketplace.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.112
Focused in on coke.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.548
Already acquired
the competition's territories.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.616
What you might call
hostile takeover.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.152
How does Marion fit in?

18:05.185 --> 18:06.619
Could be a Syndicate lieutenant.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.288
But it's just a guess.
Don't have

18:08.321 --> 18:09.622
much intel
on his operation.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.591
Well, you mess with a guy
like Payton Kirk,

18:11.624 --> 18:14.894
not only does he kill you but
he takes out your whole family.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.629
We've never been able to get
a Syndicate member to flip.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.733
Agent Banks.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.635
Catching Nathan Litke
with 50 keys

18:22.669 --> 18:24.637
could be an incentive
to break that streak.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.640
NOPD's searching his last
known residence as we speak.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.143
So, they found Litke
at his apartment.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.744
Let's go.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.580
Don't think
he's gonna do much talking.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.615
He's dead.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.284
Looks like an OD.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.652
Appears he had too much fun
tasting his own product.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.626
You want
to ask me something, ask.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.529
You been off the grid for weeks
working this case,

18:49.562 --> 18:51.364
and not one call.
Aw,

18:51.398 --> 18:53.266
don't take it personal.
I still love you.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.602
So, who is she?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.670
Well, if I tell you,
will you shut up about it?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.406
Not another peep.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.175
You remember
the movie Blind Side?

19:02.209 --> 19:03.776
Yeah. Kid from the
wrong side of the tracks

19:03.810 --> 19:05.745
gets adopted by a rich
family, makes it to the NFL.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.747
Well, that's basically me
and Marion.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.649
Her older brother
was a dope fiend.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.384
My family took her in.

19:11.418 --> 19:14.821
But instead of the NFL,
she's out here slangin' drugs.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.225
Hmm. And you're on a
crusade to stop her.

19:21.728 --> 19:22.929
There you go again,

19:22.962 --> 19:25.565
bitin' your lip.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.201
You do that when you're
not telling me everything.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.571
Look, if you don't let
the secrets out,

19:31.604 --> 19:33.440
they'll take you out.

19:37.444 --> 19:40.313
We were super close.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.749
That girl was like my sister.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.752
She was the only person
in my life that I felt

19:45.785 --> 19:47.954
like I could be
really real with.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.723
And I told her everything.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.560
Then she got
a little habit,

19:53.593 --> 19:56.296
turned into a big habit.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.298
Eventually,
it got so out of control,

19:58.331 --> 19:59.932
I told her she had to choose.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.734
You or the drugs.
Yeah.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.271
Guess which one she chose.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.875
What is it?

20:09.842 --> 20:11.811
Nathan Litke.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.446
He's dead.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.847
That's it. I'm going in.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.749
Sonja...
Look, we already lost
our best lead.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.885
We're not gonna lose
the other one, too.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.321
Hey, Percy.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.756
Hey, Percy, we gotta
wait for backup.

20:23.790 --> 20:24.957
I'm done waiting.

20:30.663 --> 20:31.931
NCIS!

20:31.964 --> 20:33.300
What the hell?!
SONJA: Get on the ground!

20:53.986 --> 20:55.722
Marion was our ticket
to taking down Kirk

20:55.755 --> 20:57.790
and the Bayou Drug Syndicate.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.693
Let me talk to her.
I know I can make her spill.
Are you kidding me?

21:01.928 --> 21:02.929
You are not going in there.

21:02.962 --> 21:03.963
Why not?

21:03.996 --> 21:06.333
Because you violated procedure.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.034
'Cause you busted
into her house

21:08.067 --> 21:11.938
without backup, could've got you
and your partner shot.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.973
I didn't want to lose her.
Oh, come on!

21:14.006 --> 21:15.608
You're smarter than that.

21:15.642 --> 21:16.776
We'd have
put a tail on her.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.778
She could've led us...

21:18.811 --> 21:20.780
right up the food chain.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.615
But you wanted
to settle an old score.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.951
Pride... Come on.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.920
I know what makes her tick.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.989
Well, that doesn't matter now.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.893
Take a breath.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.972
Who's good cop,
who's bad cop?

21:46.005 --> 21:47.073
Wait, let me guess.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.876
This a game to you?

21:49.909 --> 21:52.979
Bad cop. Just like that.
You gave yourself away.

21:53.012 --> 21:56.683
We know you run the
manufacturing wing of the BDS.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.718
Tell us where we can find Kirk
and those 50 kilos

21:58.751 --> 21:59.852
you manufactured
for the Bayou Drug Syndicate,

21:59.886 --> 22:02.088
maybe we can
work out a deal.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.724
You've been
using the flower shop

22:04.757 --> 22:08.628
to smuggle in coca leaves.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.797
Judging by the...

22:10.830 --> 22:13.900
coca residue
all over your car

22:13.933 --> 22:17.804
and the Atchafalaya peat moss
on your tires...

22:17.837 --> 22:19.406
You were transporting the goods

22:19.439 --> 22:21.374
out to the manufacturing
plant as well.

22:21.408 --> 22:23.410
Start talking.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.645
Or you're going away for a long,

22:25.678 --> 22:27.079
long time.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.117
When I was just a baby dealer,

22:31.150 --> 22:34.954
a couple of NOPD officers
busted me, offered me a deal.

22:34.987 --> 22:38.558
I didn't know no better,
so I snitched on a higher-up,

22:38.591 --> 22:40.960
got myself a reduced sentence.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.995
But when the crew
found out what I had done,

22:43.029 --> 22:44.864
they held me down

22:44.897 --> 22:48.034
and poured lye
all over my arms and legs.

22:48.067 --> 22:51.904
Where were the police officers
to protect me then, huh?

22:51.938 --> 22:55.675
So thanks, but no thanks.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.143
I'll do my time.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.414
Think of your little girl.

23:01.448 --> 23:02.415
You want her

23:02.449 --> 23:03.816
to see you behind bars?

23:03.850 --> 23:06.018
I'd rather her
visit me behind bars

23:06.052 --> 23:08.120
than come visit
my grave.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.523
She'll be all right.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.893
Auntie'll take good care of her
till I get out.

23:13.926 --> 23:16.062
WADE:
The drug runner here exhibits

23:16.095 --> 23:17.697
all the usual--

23:17.730 --> 23:20.066
fluid in the airways,

23:20.099 --> 23:22.502
vascular congestion
in the lungs

23:22.535 --> 23:24.604
and organs.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.839
Well, all signs
pointing to an overdose,

23:26.873 --> 23:28.074
which confirms
what we thought.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.076
He OD'd all right.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.911
Just not on cocaine.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.514
I found 5.2 milligrams

23:34.547 --> 23:36.916
of drugs in his system.

23:36.949 --> 23:40.953
1.2 grams is the minimal
lethal overdose.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.455
A heavy drug user like him

23:42.489 --> 23:44.457
could go as high as five.

23:44.491 --> 23:45.858
If not cocaine, what was it?

23:45.892 --> 23:47.960
I've run a detailed tox screen

23:47.994 --> 23:50.463
and, uh, Sebastian
is analyzing all the drugs

23:50.497 --> 23:51.931
found at the dealer's apartment,
see if we can find

23:51.964 --> 23:54.701
anything
out of the ordinary.

23:54.734 --> 23:55.968
You okay?

23:56.002 --> 23:58.237
It's, uh, it's really bad.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.974
The, uh, the stuff that's
used to wash the cocaine--

24:02.008 --> 24:03.643
the toluene from the TNT--

24:03.676 --> 24:05.478
it's supposed to evaporate
in the washing process,

24:05.512 --> 24:06.613
but this stuff
didn't.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.648
It stayed in the cocaine.

24:09.882 --> 24:12.585
He OD'd on explosives?

24:15.755 --> 24:19.125
So we got 50 kilos
of tainted coke out there

24:19.158 --> 24:20.993
and if we don't find it,

24:21.027 --> 24:22.895
people are gonna start dying.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.964
We need
Marion to talk.

24:24.997 --> 24:28.535
And Percy here
is our best chance.

24:30.002 --> 24:34.006
Only way to turn a suspect
into an asset

24:34.040 --> 24:36.208
is to come at 'em personal.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.044
You taught me that, Pride.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.879
Now, I know

24:39.912 --> 24:41.113
she's been
off the reservation...

24:43.182 --> 24:44.617
...but she can do this.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.086
Can I count on you?

24:47.119 --> 24:48.254
You know you can.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.657
Talking about in there.
With her.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.024
To not cross the line.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.260
Yes. Hell, yes.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.295
Not as easy as you think.

24:56.328 --> 25:00.099
Face to face with someone
you got all this history with.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.034
Boundaries get lost.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.904
Pride, I give you my word:

25:04.937 --> 25:07.073
I so much as
raise my voice,

25:07.106 --> 25:09.275
I'll hand you my shield.

25:19.619 --> 25:22.922
A social worker cop--
a woman of many talents.

25:22.955 --> 25:26.092
A drug-dealing florist--
could say the same about you.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.127
That last batch
you manufactured...

25:28.160 --> 25:30.162
You still got
that Percy temper, don't you?

25:30.196 --> 25:31.798
My five-year-old's got one.

25:31.831 --> 25:34.133
Scary. It reminds
me of you sometimes.

25:34.166 --> 25:37.103
SONJA :
Sit down. Sit.

25:40.372 --> 25:44.310
The manufacturers messed up,
they left it full of toluene.

25:44.343 --> 25:47.680
So when those drugs
hit the streets

25:47.714 --> 25:49.782
people are gonna be mourning

25:49.816 --> 25:51.918
all over this city.

25:51.951 --> 25:55.121
Don't put this on me. I ain't
got nothing to do with that.

25:55.154 --> 25:58.024
You've got everything
to do with it.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.593
Marion...

26:00.627 --> 26:03.229
I know you.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.232
You don't want people to die.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.234
Kirk's already taken
someone close away from me.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.102
He'll do the same
to my daughter...
For once

26:10.136 --> 26:13.239
in your life, Marion,
do the right thing.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.609
You act like you know what
this is about. You got no idea.

26:16.643 --> 26:19.211
SONJA: I got a pretty good one.
MARION: Oh, you know?

26:19.245 --> 26:22.048
You know that I got out of the
drug game when I had Brianne?

26:22.081 --> 26:24.651
That I was working a double
as a cocktail waitress?

26:24.684 --> 26:26.218
That I was
going to night school?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.920
Studying what,
advanced trafficking?

26:27.954 --> 26:29.388
Marion...

26:29.421 --> 26:32.058
you're not a student.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.093
Or a waitress.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.729
You're a dealer.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.097
You don't escape
your past,

26:38.130 --> 26:40.633
no matter how much
distance you make.

26:42.201 --> 26:46.005
My brother-- Davis--
you remember him?

26:47.239 --> 26:48.741
He started working

26:48.775 --> 26:51.143
for the Syndicate
a few years back.

26:51.177 --> 26:54.280
He made a mistake:
he was dealing on the side.

26:54.313 --> 26:58.150
Payton Kirk found out
and he paid with his life.

26:58.184 --> 27:02.021
The cash debt became mine.
I got sucked back in.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.295
Background on your, uh...

27:09.328 --> 27:10.997
Auntie Shay.

27:11.030 --> 27:14.934
She's got quite the record.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.069
It's nothing violent, but...

27:17.103 --> 27:18.705
it's bad enough
to keep Child Services

27:18.738 --> 27:20.740
from handing her Brianne.

27:20.773 --> 27:23.242
So...

27:23.275 --> 27:25.244
when you go to prison,

27:25.277 --> 27:28.214
Brianne is going
straight into the system.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.716
Bounce from

27:29.749 --> 27:31.183
one messed-up house to another,

27:31.217 --> 27:33.085
just like her mother.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.220
Don't.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.788
SONJA:
You want a better

27:35.822 --> 27:37.223
life for Brianne,

27:37.256 --> 27:39.225
you give me Kirk

27:39.258 --> 27:41.460
and the location
of the missing coke.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.763
We were never friends.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.164
You talked
a good game--

27:45.197 --> 27:47.433
all that loyalty crap--
but when

27:47.466 --> 27:50.703
I needed you,
you turned your back on me.

27:50.737 --> 27:53.172
It was true then
and it's true now.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.808
I'll do what you want.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.777
But when this is over,

27:57.810 --> 28:01.347
I want you to leave me
and my daughter the hell alone.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.353
SONJA :
Marion confirmed the meet.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.356
Kirk should be showing up
any second.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.492
We need to get the location
of the stash house on the wire.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.027
Once we have it,

28:15.061 --> 28:17.429
wait until Marion is secure.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.431
Then we take this scumbag down.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.768
Go on your signal, Pride.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.009
PRIDE :
Here comes Kirk now.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.078
Stand by.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.780
Here we go.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.382
Hey.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.150
No tail, right?

28:38.184 --> 28:40.753
No, all good.
I watched my back.
Course you did.

28:40.787 --> 28:43.155
Listen, I-I... I got to talk
to you about the last package

28:43.189 --> 28:44.256
that came out
of the bayou.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.125
Shh.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.160
You never can be too careful.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.231
Get in.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.266
Let's take a drive.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.872
Something doesn't feel right.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.313
PRIDE:
You two tail 'em.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.983
MARION: Listen, I was saying
about the packages...

29:11.017 --> 29:13.285
KIRK:
Responsibility, Marion. I know

29:13.319 --> 29:16.022
you got yours to your family,
I got mine

29:16.055 --> 29:17.423
to my business. Right now...
MARION: Yeah?

29:17.456 --> 29:18.791
KIRK:
...you're a threat to mine.

29:18.825 --> 29:20.159
SONJA: They're heading
into the tunnel.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.393
We're two cars behind.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.962
PRIDE:
All right, stay with 'em.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.030
KIRK: You know,
after this, that debt

29:24.063 --> 29:25.998
your brother left you with?

29:26.032 --> 29:28.134
It's all taken care of.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.336
MARION: I can explain. It's not
what... It's not what you think.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.838
KIRK: You should have kept
your damn mouth shut.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.106
Shots fired,
shots fired.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.507
PRIDE:
Get in there. Go get her.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.111
We'll meet you on the other end.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.479
SONJA: Come on, come on,
come on, LaSalle!

29:40.512 --> 29:42.381
Step on it!

29:46.352 --> 29:47.854
What the...?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop, stop!

29:49.621 --> 29:52.324
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no-- Marion.

29:52.358 --> 29:53.425
Marion!

29:53.459 --> 29:55.061
Hold on, Marion.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.965
PRIDE:
They're coming out.

29:58.998 --> 29:59.999
I got 'em.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.173
Hands!

30:11.343 --> 30:13.012
Get out of the car, slow!

30:13.045 --> 30:14.480
Easy.

30:14.513 --> 30:17.383
Please, don't shoot.
Please.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.285
Open the back door.

30:22.388 --> 30:25.491
Got a victim down. Need an
ambulance in the Harvey tunnel.

30:25.524 --> 30:28.560
Marion, hold on.
It's gonna be okay. Hold on.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.362
Hold on, hold on.

30:30.396 --> 30:31.630
It's gonna be okay.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.500
It's gonna be okay.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.368
Hold on.

30:45.444 --> 30:46.979
Spoke to the driver.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.448
Guy's freaked out of
his mind and clueless.

30:49.481 --> 30:52.118
He works for Uber. Kirk was just
another one of his passengers.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.120
He say where the shot
was fired?

30:54.153 --> 30:56.622
About two-thirds of the way into
the tunnel. That's when Kirk

30:56.655 --> 30:58.925
turned his gun on him, forced
him to let him out of the car

30:58.958 --> 30:59.992
in the middle of traffic.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.093
My men searched every car

31:01.127 --> 31:02.929
coming in and out,
all were clear.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.934
Traffic cams catch anyone
exiting the staircase?

31:07.967 --> 31:10.136
Nothing.
The guy just vanished.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.171
Well, nobody vanishes.

31:14.440 --> 31:18.577
From what we
heard on the wire...

31:18.610 --> 31:20.412
Kirk must have
made Marion

31:20.446 --> 31:22.915
before she even
set up the meet.

31:22.949 --> 31:25.417
Planned the whole thing.

31:25.451 --> 31:29.055
Chose this very tunnel to
take her out in for a reason.

31:30.189 --> 31:33.926
Because he knew another way out.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.268
How y'all holdin' up?
Mm-mm.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.403
We're going
to get ice cream.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.273
Yes, it's hard just sitting
around waitin' like this,

31:47.306 --> 31:49.408
so, thought
we'd get a little fresh air.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.944
And some ice cream.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.280
Well, let us know if we
can do anything for you.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.314
Thank you.

31:58.617 --> 32:02.088
Talked to the nurse
on the way over here.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.391
Marion's still in surgery,
but the outlook's good.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.026
Oh, she got lucky.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.528
Bullet missed her heart
by a couple of inches.

32:09.561 --> 32:11.197
Lucky?

32:11.230 --> 32:14.000
She was trying to clean up
her brother's mistakes,

32:14.033 --> 32:16.202
and I just...

32:16.235 --> 32:19.071
Look, you did what you had
to do, as simple as that.

32:19.105 --> 32:23.742
Yeah, and that little girl might
lose her mother because of it.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.078
Marion chose the street.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.646
All right? You can't
blame yourself.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.648
You don't understand.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.950
Try me.

32:36.088 --> 32:38.690
You can't get left
if you never let anyone in.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.159
Is that it?

32:41.527 --> 32:43.962
That's no way to live, Percy.

32:49.035 --> 32:51.203
I'm the one
who does the leaving.

32:54.506 --> 32:57.076
She came back.

32:57.109 --> 33:00.146
After I kicked her out all
those years ago, she came back.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.014
She was desperate.

33:02.048 --> 33:05.251
She wanted me to take her
to rehab. She was...

33:05.284 --> 33:07.019
tweaking out, so, I...

33:07.053 --> 33:10.122
I thought she was trying
to play me, but...

33:10.156 --> 33:11.757
I stood my ground.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.594
I felt like
I couldn't trust her.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.796
That's 'cause she had broken it.

33:17.829 --> 33:22.368
And once someone does that,
it's hard to let 'em back in.

33:22.401 --> 33:25.704
No, but if I would've helped her
then, she wouldn't be here now.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.173
Yeah, and if I had

33:27.206 --> 33:30.076
a dollar every time
I tried to help Cade,

33:30.109 --> 33:32.278
straighten him out,
well, I'd be rich.

33:34.646 --> 33:38.050
Look, this is not
on you, Percy.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.325
You were right, Pride-- that
corridor Kirk snuck out through,

33:46.358 --> 33:48.327
opened up a quarter mile out.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.063
Yeah, it'd be a perfect escape
plan if it wasn't for Triple P.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.465
I found a security cam at
the tunnel's maintenance yard.

33:53.499 --> 33:54.833
I got that fool.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.668
Run the plates.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.207
That's not our guy.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.674
PATTON:
Yeah, and you know why?

34:02.708 --> 34:04.176
'Cause he's dead.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.147
It's Kirk's ghost.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.282
Escobar, Bulger, El Chapo--
they all have one.

34:10.316 --> 34:13.085
They use a dead person's
identity to buy cars, houses,

34:13.119 --> 34:15.154
file tax returns.
It's how they exist

34:15.187 --> 34:16.555
in the world without existing.

34:19.258 --> 34:21.227
Damn, our ghost
is a high roller.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.862
He got a yacht,
a handful of thoroughbreds...

34:23.895 --> 34:25.864
And a mansion in the heart
of the Garden District.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.200
Brody, get ahold
of Sonja and Lasalle.

34:28.234 --> 34:29.301
Tell 'em to meet
us en route.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.737
Banks, get your gang.
Yup.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.139
Let's end this thing.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.815
Banks, your men in position?

34:43.849 --> 34:45.884
Got eyes from every corner.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.254
Sniper on the church tower.

34:48.287 --> 34:50.722
Good. On my signal.
No, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:50.756 --> 34:54.160
I know that burgundy junker.
It's Auntie's. I saw her drive

34:54.193 --> 34:56.262
from the hospital in it.
LASALLE:
That little rat.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.130
We should have
known it was her.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.398
She was the only one there
when we took down Marion.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.899
Must have told Kirk,
sold her out.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.135
Pride, Brianne was in that car.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.571
Look, if we go in there,
and things get hot,

35:05.604 --> 35:07.773
she'll be caught right
in the middle of it.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.209
Look, I'll go in first
before all the shooting starts.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.910
You won't make it past
the entrance.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.146
No, my undercover is still good.
Big Baldy over there...

35:14.180 --> 35:17.249
works security at the house
I was dealing out of.

35:17.283 --> 35:20.586
If Auntie sees you,
you're made.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.522
Come on, Pride,
I have to do this.

35:23.555 --> 35:27.159
If anything happens
to that little girl...

35:31.963 --> 35:33.365
Take this.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.339
Be smart.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.711
Attention, all units.

35:45.744 --> 35:48.314
UC approaching the front door.

35:57.323 --> 35:59.258
Woody!

36:01.260 --> 36:02.861
What up, Woody?

36:02.894 --> 36:04.263
What do you
think you're doing?

36:04.296 --> 36:06.298
Yo, man, let me go talk to Kirk.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.633
That's funny, shorty.
Step off.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.635
Look, man, I got word

36:09.668 --> 36:11.437
that something heavy
about to come down on us.

36:11.470 --> 36:14.340
Now you can let me go
talk to him, Big Slim,

36:14.373 --> 36:15.574
or you can be the dude

36:15.607 --> 36:16.842
that stopped word
from gettin' through.

36:20.412 --> 36:21.647
Come on, man.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.323
Sit your ass down, man.
Wait here.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.859
I'll go tell him you here.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.013
BRIANNE: Can Mommy bring
me next week? No.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.016
I have to bring you
next week to get ice cream.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.252
Okay, can we go
on a mountain hike?

37:00.286 --> 37:01.353
Okay.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.988
We got her. We're coming out.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.023
Brianne, come on.
Let's go see your mommy, baby.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.260
Hands. Now.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.264
Come on, Kirk.

37:12.298 --> 37:15.000
Man, we're stuck back here
in the sun room, surrounded

37:15.033 --> 37:16.502
by Federal agents...

37:16.535 --> 37:17.836
You're done.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.371
That's a fair point.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.573
But I got you, Agent, hmm?

37:21.607 --> 37:24.276
And that little girl there.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.412
So I say we're even.

37:29.548 --> 37:32.618
:
Come on. Stay down.
Aah! You stop moving!

37:32.651 --> 37:34.320
Down on the ground.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.487
PRIDE: Sniper, do you
have a shot?
Negative.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.357
SONJA:
Make me.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.927
What did you say to me?

37:41.960 --> 37:43.329
Pride, now!

37:43.362 --> 37:44.396
PRIDE:
Fire!

37:49.968 --> 37:52.638
Auntie's headed your way.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.340
Kirk's out for the count.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.642
Not another step!

37:56.675 --> 37:58.877
Okay. Okay.
PRIDE:
Hands! Hands!

37:58.910 --> 38:00.812
Come here. It's okay.

38:00.846 --> 38:03.014
It's okay. We're okay.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.483
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.898
Keys to your new life.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.668
U.S. Marshal Service
has set you and Brianne up

38:22.701 --> 38:25.404
with a place
in Witness Protection.

38:25.437 --> 38:28.039
All you gotta do is sign.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.309
Don't want your charity.

38:33.612 --> 38:38.049
You know what?
Do it for her.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.819
The goal is to give your kid a
better life than you had, right?

38:40.852 --> 38:43.955
Well, here's your chance.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.468
I heard what you did for her.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.507
Going in that house.

39:02.774 --> 39:05.377
Yeah, well...

39:07.045 --> 39:10.449
Things got mixed up
between us, but...

39:10.482 --> 39:12.884
she ain't had nothin'
to do with that.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.492
You know...

39:20.526 --> 39:23.795
it might be too late, but...

39:23.829 --> 39:25.063
I'm sorry.

39:27.499 --> 39:30.035
You reached out for my help,
and I shut you out.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.506
Yeah, I...

39:34.540 --> 39:37.776
I-I didn't give you much reason
to trust me back then.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.612
So...

39:40.646 --> 39:43.014
Anyway, I...

39:44.716 --> 39:48.720
Maybe we'll send you a postcard
or something from Idaho.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.723
Wherever we end up.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.730
Take care of yourself.

40:09.207 --> 40:12.143
*

40:12.177 --> 40:15.581
* Breaking my way
through the storm *

40:18.750 --> 40:19.718
* This beating heart...

40:19.751 --> 40:21.186
Who is it?

40:21.219 --> 40:22.688
:
John Besh.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.992
Really?

40:27.025 --> 40:29.695
Figured you wouldn't come
to my Gumbo Z'herbes,

40:29.728 --> 40:31.830
so I'm bringing 'em
to you.

40:31.863 --> 40:34.600
You're our team vegan, and Pride
has never made anything

40:34.633 --> 40:37.469
without a heartbeat in it,
so, uh, so exciting.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.170
We didn't want you
to miss out.
Oh.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.507
And I thought
you could use a drink.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.976
Hmm... Well, glasses
are over the sink.

40:45.010 --> 40:50.015
* What we'll do

40:50.048 --> 40:52.584
* Dear love, I miss you...

40:52.618 --> 40:55.120
Well, no reason to keep this
around anymore, huh?

40:55.153 --> 40:57.489
Right?
Huh

40:57.523 --> 41:01.793
She's better... now that
she's got a fresh start.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.995
You know, Pride, thank you

41:04.029 --> 41:07.633
for letting me see this through.

41:07.666 --> 41:08.967
Closure's important.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.502
Believe me, I get that.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.640
And so's trust.

41:14.673 --> 41:18.610
You worked alone
for so long, maybe...

41:18.644 --> 41:20.779
maybe this team
thing isn't for you.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.882
Oh, look, I...
I got what I needed.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.951
You know, I'm good now, Pride.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.853
You can trust me.

41:27.886 --> 41:31.122
I hope so.

41:31.156 --> 41:36.094
May come a time when I have to
make the call, and the team...

41:39.665 --> 41:41.032
They come first.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.568
You hear me?

41:42.601 --> 41:44.936
Loud and clear.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.938
LASALLE:
Percy?

41:46.972 --> 41:48.239
It's time for you to try

41:48.273 --> 41:49.641
some of my homemade
blackberry wine.

41:49.675 --> 41:50.508
Do I have to?

41:50.542 --> 41:52.611
Just make...
just put on a smiling face.

41:54.312 --> 41:56.682
Come on!
No, it's good.
I'm not kidding you.

41:58.617 --> 42:01.620
Hey... to new beginnings.

42:01.653 --> 42:03.589
* I'll always be here
for you *

42:03.622 --> 42:06.057
* When you

42:06.091 --> 42:09.561
* Find your way.
