♪♪

00:06.674 --> 00:08.807
-They're getting married!
-I'll believe it when I see it.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.342
Maya Penelope Hunter!

00:10.344 --> 00:11.677
No, still Maya Hart.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.945
What's my name gonna be?

00:12.947 --> 00:14.313
How do you not understand this?

00:14.315 --> 00:17.282
I can't even think straight.
So excited.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.118
Once Uncle Shawn
marries your mother,

00:19.120 --> 00:20.886
it's like we're gonna
be related.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.354
We're already like sisters,

00:22.356 --> 00:24.890
and then we're gonna
be like cousins!

00:26.360 --> 00:28.293
That-- that's less.
What happened?

00:29.697 --> 00:31.964
Riley, you know how I feel
about hope, okay?

00:31.966 --> 00:33.465
Please don't get my hopes up
for this wedding.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.634
Hope is not
for suckers anymore, Maya.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.803
Hope has finally
come around to beam for you.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.138
Well, I'd like
to believe that,

00:39.140 --> 00:41.140
but you turned me back into me,
and me knows better.

00:41.142 --> 00:44.643
Hey, happily ever after
is happening,

00:44.645 --> 00:46.712
so get your fairytale butt out
of the dungeon

00:46.714 --> 00:48.080
and into the sunlight.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.515
(knock on door)

00:49.517 --> 00:51.717
And here comes the dragon
to burn down everything.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.219
-Hi, girls.
-The wedding's off. I knew it.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.088
I mean "hi."

00:56.090 --> 00:58.357
-She's a-scared.
-You're his
best friend, Matthews.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.476
You know he ain't
going through with it.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.594
As long as I've known him,
I have never seen him
this happy.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.930
Because I've never
seen him happy.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.533
Maya, we are planning
the wedding.

01:07.535 --> 01:08.567
We want you to help.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.335
-This is happening?
-This is happening.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.370
Prove it.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.805
-Katy!
-Happy!

01:14.075 --> 01:15.240
Please be there.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.844
Hey. What's up, kiddo?

01:18.846 --> 01:21.847
Maya's scared that
the wedding's gonna
come apart like--

01:21.849 --> 01:24.750
come apart like--
What is something
that has come apart?

01:24.752 --> 01:27.352
All of their
previous relationships.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.723
Maya, Shawn and I are blessed
to have found each other.

01:31.725 --> 01:32.791
No one's going anywhere.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.126
How can you be sure?

01:34.128 --> 01:35.294
'Cause of this.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.429
(both chuckle)

01:38.766 --> 01:40.599
Come on, Maya.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.468
Your mom and I are
perfect for each other.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.270
(scoffs)
Twist the knife,
why don't ya?

01:46.373 --> 01:47.773
Try to be strong, Cory.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.975
30 years I gave him.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.045
Those are just words, Shawn.

01:53.047 --> 01:54.613
You love each other,
then prove it.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.449
(whispers) Whoa.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.252
I've always known how
to get out of anything, Maya.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.387
The only thing
that holds me here

02:02.389 --> 02:03.422
is her.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.857
Riley and Topanga:
Aww!

02:11.665 --> 02:13.732
You make me sick.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.770
Well, it's good he left,

02:18.772 --> 02:20.339
'cause he would've hated this.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.442
"There was nowhere to go
but everywhere,

02:23.444 --> 02:26.812
so just keep on rolling
under the stars."

02:26.814 --> 02:28.814
Kerouac wrote that
in On the Road.

02:28.816 --> 02:33.652
I feel like my entire life
I've been on the road.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.687
Well, welcome home.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.890
(Katy chuckles)

02:39.293 --> 02:40.626
Something good
is happening for me?

02:40.628 --> 02:41.793
(chuckles)

02:41.795 --> 02:43.428
Something good
is happening for me?

02:45.032 --> 02:47.466
We got a wedding
to plan, Maya.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.867
You gonna be
a part of it?

Riley Matthews!

04:14.455 --> 04:16.922
I am plagued by doubts!

04:21.061 --> 04:23.195
(louder) Okay, get up.
I need to talk to you.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.195
(grunts)

05:00.634 --> 05:02.200
When good things happen...

05:04.838 --> 05:07.506
do they stay good...

05:07.508 --> 05:10.509
or does a little bit of good
just bring a bigger disaster?

05:12.413 --> 05:15.747
Or how do you deal
with a good thing? How?

05:18.419 --> 05:20.252
Bay window!
Bay window right now!

05:24.491 --> 05:26.258
How do you sleep?

05:29.129 --> 05:31.697
I've always been
a light sleeper.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.765
Ever since my father left.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.668
Just 'cause I could always hear
my mother crying in her bedroom.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.546
I'd try to go in
and stop her from crying...

05:47.548 --> 05:49.681
but I couldn't.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.516
So, I'd try to
fall asleep next to her,

05:51.518 --> 05:53.218
but I couldn't.

05:56.657 --> 05:59.124
"Mom, would you stop crying
if Daddy came back?"

06:01.128 --> 06:02.861
And she'd look
at me and say,

06:02.863 --> 06:04.629
"We don't need
anyone else, baby girl.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.398
All I need is you."

06:07.334 --> 06:08.700
(sighs)

06:08.702 --> 06:10.168
Too much responsibility.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.371
Can't sleep, Riley.
Been up since I'm four.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.643
I know it's right
that she finally has someone.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.681
But I also know that
I never want her to
go through that again.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.350
And what's the use
in having a wedding

06:25.352 --> 06:27.452
if you don't know
if it's gonna last forever?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.822
How do you know
it's gonna last forever?

06:34.995 --> 06:36.595
Thanks for listening.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.765
Are you up?

06:39.767 --> 06:40.799
(snoring)

06:43.604 --> 06:45.704
(in Texan accent)
Riley, it's me, Lucas.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.038
I wanna be
a veterinarian

06:47.040 --> 06:49.341
and I wanna kiss your face.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.344
(smacks lips)

06:53.847 --> 06:55.547
Ew.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.482
(snores)

06:58.786 --> 07:01.353
Yip, yip, yip, yip,
yip, yip, yip, yip.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.523
Cory?

07:04.525 --> 07:07.559
Well, I certainly hope so.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.760
What are you doin'?

07:08.762 --> 07:09.895
I couldn't sleep.

07:09.897 --> 07:10.929
But you could sleep here?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.664
Like an angel.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.234
So Shawn, listen,
this whole committing

07:16.236 --> 07:17.769
your whole life
to another person thing,

07:17.771 --> 07:19.037
very big step.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.238
I love her.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.140
Okay, so here's the big test.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.208
Yes, more than you.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.709
Who do you love more?

07:24.711 --> 07:25.811
Do you love her
more than me?

07:25.813 --> 07:28.747
-Yes.
-It's a simple
yes or no, Shawn.

07:28.749 --> 07:32.250
-Yes.
-Ask me who I like more,
you or Topanga.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.085
Who do you like more,
me or Topanga?

07:34.087 --> 07:35.554
Topanga!

07:36.723 --> 07:39.124
Shocked? Surprised?
You gonna cry?

07:39.126 --> 07:42.093
Well, don't because
that's the way it is, pally.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.629
Topanga is my entire life,

07:44.631 --> 07:46.731
and that's how I want
you to feel about Katy.

07:46.733 --> 07:47.799
I do.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.769
I give you permission.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.237
I don't need your permission.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.306
I like her way more than you.

07:54.308 --> 07:57.342
I set you free,
my little Shawnee bird.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.545
Fly! Fly away!

08:01.482 --> 08:02.747
Don't go.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.784
I love Katy, Cory.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.686
She's first in my life.
You're second.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.322
Maybe even third.
That's how much I love her.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.860
Slumber party over.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.669
Slumber party back on!

08:26.173 --> 08:27.672
Okay, okay, okay!

08:27.674 --> 08:28.740
-Okay!
-(laughs)

08:43.023 --> 08:44.623
Question number 10.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.857
Do the thoughts
of your fiancé

08:45.859 --> 08:47.859
make you feel
all warm and fuzzy inside?

08:47.861 --> 08:48.827
I don't even know
his middle name.

08:48.829 --> 08:49.828
It's Patrick.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.029
Patrick.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.831
Shawn Patrick Hunter...

08:52.833 --> 08:54.900
I wanna marry him!

08:55.869 --> 08:58.236
-Fuzzy!
-(chuckles)

08:58.238 --> 09:01.072
Okay, I'll--
I'll go ahead
and put "yes."

09:01.074 --> 09:04.342
Why would someone
who had something go
so unbelievably wrong

09:04.344 --> 09:05.644
want to do it
all over again?

09:05.646 --> 09:06.711
She loves Shawn?

09:06.713 --> 09:07.846
She loved my father.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.514
Well, Shawn isn't
like your father.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.550
What if my father
wasn't like my father

09:11.552 --> 09:12.951
until he met my mother?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.321
-Um--
-What if my mother

09:16.323 --> 09:17.989
has some sort of,
like, nut gene

09:17.991 --> 09:19.891
that in combination
with any man at all

09:19.893 --> 09:23.028
makes him go from "I do"
to "What I do"?

09:23.030 --> 09:25.030
Well, I think that
the hope is that

09:25.032 --> 09:26.765
Shawn is not
just any man at all.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.433
I want him in my life forever.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.501
So?

09:29.503 --> 09:31.102
So my experience is that

09:31.104 --> 09:33.738
getting married
kills that real good.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.941
Well, that's not what happens
in my experience.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.576
Well, you're lucky
and I'm not.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.710
Okay,

09:38.712 --> 09:40.946
well, then here's
all the luck I got.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.280
(makes whooshing sounds)

09:42.282 --> 09:44.382
-(whooshes)
-Ta-ha!

09:44.384 --> 09:45.450
Thanks, Riles.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.851
Did you save any luck
for yourself?

09:49.623 --> 09:51.056
Okay, here.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.657
Whaaa!

09:54.294 --> 09:55.627
Okay, Katy.

09:56.530 --> 09:57.762
By the power
vested in me

09:57.764 --> 09:59.631
as the quiz giver
of this magazine,

09:59.633 --> 10:01.132
I know declare...

10:01.134 --> 10:02.267
none of this means anything.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.903
Here's what matters.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.705
You're on the edge
of a cliff.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.306
Today is the cliff.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.909
Tomorrow, there is nothing
underneath your feet.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.278
Hopefully every day
brings solid ground.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.981
But with everything you know...

10:15.983 --> 10:17.349
are you jumping or what?

10:19.086 --> 10:21.786
I have long since
reconciled with God

10:21.788 --> 10:25.457
that if nothing else
remarkable happens in my life,

10:25.459 --> 10:27.592
I am thankful
for my daughter

10:27.594 --> 10:29.294
and for friends
who care about me.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.829
And if that's all
I ever get,

10:30.831 --> 10:32.897
then it's a lovely life
and I'm grateful for it.

10:32.899 --> 10:36.968
Well, Katy,
as your friend,

10:36.970 --> 10:38.870
I want you to have more.

10:39.806 --> 10:40.872
You're so sweet.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.580
Maya, as your friend,

10:48.582 --> 10:50.015
I want you to have more.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.249
You heard her.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.817
she has a lovely life now,

10:52.819 --> 10:53.985
and you know
what the difference is

10:53.987 --> 10:55.120
between this time
and last time?

10:55.122 --> 10:56.421
What?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.723
I'm here to stop anything
that could change that.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.667
So who's gonna be
your best man?

11:08.669 --> 11:11.169
Me? All right.
That's done.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.972
Oh! Oh, can you believe
that this is happening?

11:13.974 --> 11:16.508
I don't see how anything
could possibly stop it.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.011
(door rattles)

11:20.013 --> 11:21.279
-(knocking)
-Who is it?

11:21.281 --> 11:22.714
Riley Matthews.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.050
I'm doing this
myself, okay?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.885
I don't need
your stupid optimism.
I only want reality.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.853
Oh!

11:28.855 --> 11:31.089
Well, the reality is
you forgot to bolt the door!

11:32.359 --> 11:33.391
-(Riley laughs)
-(keys rattle)

11:33.393 --> 11:34.959
Ya-chow! Keys!

11:34.961 --> 11:36.561
Ya-chow! Let me see! Yeah.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.065
Well, now I'm stuck good.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.735
Why do you want
to marry my mother?

11:43.737 --> 11:45.537
To get back at me.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.373
'Cause I love her, Maya.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.075
Words. Those are just words.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.043
Yeah, they are.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.979
But I don't say
those words a lot, all right?

11:54.981 --> 11:57.082
I was never even sure
what they meant.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.217
And now I am.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.586
They're the best words I got.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.054
So, they're important.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.456
I want you to understand them.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.876
(screams)

12:24.878 --> 12:27.278
Maya, please don't ruin
this for yourself.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.047
Why won't you let
yourself deserve something?

12:29.049 --> 12:30.115
(door slams shut)

12:32.919 --> 12:34.452
Continue.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.922
I already asked you
for your blessing,
and you gave it.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.424
Yes, okay.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.992
That's why words aren't enough.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.261
Look, I feel different.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.263
I feel scared.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.198
Of what?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.167
Of why this needs
to happen at all.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.303
You like my mother,
she likes you.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.038
Everyone's happy,
so what's the reason

12:54.040 --> 12:55.940
that anything else
needs to happen?

12:58.078 --> 12:59.377
You and me are the same.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.913
We are.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.481
Bad things happen to us.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.817
They do.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.720
So what if life doesn't know
that this is happening yet

13:08.722 --> 13:11.156
and what if life figures out
that we're involved?

13:11.158 --> 13:13.057
(whispers)
That's when
something bad happens.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.127
What if she's right?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.097
She's wrong.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.064
-Why?
-Because I want her to be wrong.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.733
Why get life involved
with a big ceremony?

13:21.735 --> 13:25.136
Because your mother
and I want to invite life
to this ceremony, Maya.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.406
We want life to change us
for the better.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.576
Promise me this will work.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.977
No, I can't.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.847
I can promise
that I want it to.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.949
And I can promise
that you're a big part of that.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.083
Ask me why.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.652
Why?

13:40.654 --> 13:43.021
'Cause I never want
to let you down.

13:47.861 --> 13:48.927
Get her!

13:48.929 --> 13:50.728
And get my key back.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.097
Maya, what are you doin'?

13:53.099 --> 13:55.934
I know you like me.
I like you too.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.336
Thanks for everything
you've ever done for me
because it's perfect.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.637
I want it to stay perfect.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.172
I don't want it
to not be perfect,
so game over.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.175
-Thanks for playing.
-Hey, kid, let me
stop you right there.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.944
This wedding ain't about you.

14:05.946 --> 14:06.978
What?

14:06.980 --> 14:09.214
This wedding is about
your mother and me.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.683
I'm marrying her
because I love her.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.117
Hey, thanks.

14:13.119 --> 14:15.486
Anytime. You're gonna
hear it a lot.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.355
And guess what else?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.157
We respect
your tragedies, Maya.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.325
We do.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.360
We've had our own.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.295
But we're taking
a leap of faith here.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.599
You wanna jump with us?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.501
Prove you're ready.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.304
-What, right now?
-Right now.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.373
I can't do that.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.575
How could I possibly do that?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.550
Hey, Maya.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.252
We jumpin' or what?

14:57.898 --> 14:59.230
So what do
you wanna do tonight?

14:59.232 --> 15:01.266
Dinner, movie...

15:02.068 --> 15:03.501
get married?

15:04.504 --> 15:05.837
Huh.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.439
Well, isn't this reckless

15:08.441 --> 15:11.509
and spontaneous of you,
Shawn Patrick Hunter.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.677
That's me.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.078
Oh, my gosh.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.281
He really loves her.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.150
She really loves him.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.187
Shawn?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.557
Uh, it would--
it would be okay

15:26.559 --> 15:30.428
if, like, some of this
had a little bit to do with me.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.863
Then it does.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.198
That's nice.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.134
That's so nice!

15:37.938 --> 15:39.304
Would you please excuse me?

15:39.306 --> 15:40.438
Maybe for a second.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.907
All right.
(chuckles)

15:42.909 --> 15:44.642
Katy:
Ohh...

15:44.644 --> 15:46.077
I got nothin' to wear.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.879
I got no shoes.
I got flip flops.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.113
I'mma flip-flop down the aisle.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.215
You got anything to wear?

15:51.217 --> 15:53.451
Uh, this here on my body.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.253
Yeah.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.287
No.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.806
What? What? No, we have to!

15:57.807 --> 15:59.324
The guy who's marrying us
gets here in an hour.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.592
-You're gonna love him.
-Oh. (chuckles)

16:01.594 --> 16:02.961
-You my maid of honor?
-Uh-huh.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.495
-Do it.
-Okay.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.500
This is something good.

16:09.502 --> 16:13.004
This is something good
that is happening to you, Maya.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.407
This is what it feels like.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.990
Suit, shirt,
shoes, ties, boutonnière.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.392
I can't believe this is
really happening! Right?

16:36.096 --> 16:37.328
Uh, can we sit down
for a second?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.002
Will I make a good husband?

16:44.004 --> 16:46.971
I got a boutonnière.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.507
If you're getting cold feet,
I will drag you up there myself.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.443
No, I-- I am marrying
the woman I love today.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.946
I just want to know

16:54.948 --> 16:57.949
if I'm gonna be
a good husband for her.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.150
Oh, that?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.852
-(chuckles)
-Shawn...

17:00.854 --> 17:04.389
only someone who's truly
in love with someone else

17:04.391 --> 17:05.690
would care if they're ready.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.493
Because you care
enough to ask.

17:08.495 --> 17:13.364
Shawn, only someone who cares
enough to ask knows for sure.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.303
Yee!

17:19.305 --> 17:20.571
Should I return
the boutonnière?

17:24.411 --> 17:25.910
I've been looking for you.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.578
-Why?
-Um...

17:27.580 --> 17:29.680
-before we do this...
-Yeah?

17:29.682 --> 17:32.517
...no matter what
the future brings, I...

17:32.519 --> 17:35.253
I want you to know how much
I want to be a good wife.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.791
That's all I've been
thinking about.

17:40.994 --> 17:43.428
Do you think I could
be a good wife?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.066
Yeah. I'd bet my life on it.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.971
(romantic music plays)

18:34.314 --> 18:35.580
Fee-nay?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.648
-Both: Fuh-huh--
-Cut it out.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.617
All:
Yes, sir.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.453
Who's that?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.422
-Mr. Feeny.
-Who's Mr. Feeny?

18:44.424 --> 18:45.556
I think he's my grandfather.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.158
You're a minister too?

18:47.160 --> 18:48.326
Just go with it.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.894
Okay.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.663
I am many things
to many people.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.165
Grandpa!

18:54.167 --> 18:55.233
No.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.074
You can't come out with me.

19:03.076 --> 19:04.542
I'm giving you away!

19:05.778 --> 19:06.978
Okay.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.045
Give me away.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.716
You're a good little boy.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.485
I've done some things.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.421
Yeah, well,
you're her problem now.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.090
Bye-bye. Go get married.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.496
May I give you away too?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.538
(romantic music plays)

19:39.179 --> 19:41.112
I'm probably gonna cry.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.514
Baby.

19:54.127 --> 19:56.360
We are gathered here today

19:56.362 --> 19:58.829
to witness the joining
of two souls:

19:58.831 --> 20:02.667
Shawn Patrick Hunter
and Katy Grace...

20:02.669 --> 20:04.468
Cleeterbooskay.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.538
It's Clutterbucket.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.873
Yes, I know.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.242
I'm just trying to
give you some dignity.

20:13.980 --> 20:17.548
Well, then make me Hunter
as quick as you can.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.750
Now I believe you two
have written your own vows.

20:19.752 --> 20:23.154
Mr. Hunter, the assignment
is due right now.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.389
He needs more time, Feeny.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.560
-You got anything?
-Yeah.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.899
I was looking for a quote
that applied to us,

20:34.901 --> 20:37.168
and what I found was...

20:38.404 --> 20:41.505
"Marrying for love
may be a bit risky,

20:41.507 --> 20:45.610
but it is so honest,
God can't help but smile on it."

20:45.612 --> 20:48.779
The lives we've lead until now
have made us both wonder

20:48.781 --> 20:52.583
if like knows
what it's doing
with us at all.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.088
Here's my life.

20:57.090 --> 21:01.392
My two best friends
get married...

21:01.394 --> 21:05.296
and have a daughter
who has a best friend

21:05.298 --> 21:07.565
whose mother is you.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.268
I believe in life

21:10.270 --> 21:14.205
and in the long road
that led me here to you.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.642
I promise I'll walk with you

21:17.644 --> 21:19.343
as long as you'll let me.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.481
I promise I will walk with you
no matter where it leads.

21:23.483 --> 21:26.617
As long as you're next to me...

21:26.619 --> 21:27.818
this is our road.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.154
Who wrote that for you?

21:31.557 --> 21:32.890
We wrote it together.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.225
Oh.

21:34.227 --> 21:37.561
Well, Mr. Hunter, I always
knew you had potential.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.263
(sniffles)

21:39.265 --> 21:41.465
What's the matter, Ava?

21:41.467 --> 21:43.634
This reminds me
of our wedding.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.505
It's their time now, darling.

21:47.507 --> 21:48.673
We lived our lives.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.478
Do you, Katy Grace,

21:54.480 --> 21:56.447
take Shawn Patrick--

21:56.449 --> 21:57.548
Wait a minute.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.554
Before this happens...

22:04.957 --> 22:06.490
I'm with you.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.593
I'm jumping with you.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.164
Thanks, kiddo.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.202
And I've always been with you.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.204
(chuckles)

22:23.676 --> 22:24.842
Proceed.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.977
(chuckles)

22:26.979 --> 22:30.514
To have and to hold
until death do you part?

22:30.516 --> 22:31.615
Yes.

22:31.617 --> 22:34.185
Yes, I do
no matter what happens.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.320
And do you,
Shawn Patrick,

22:36.322 --> 22:39.657
take Katy Grace
to have and to hold

22:39.659 --> 22:42.093
until death
do you part?

22:43.162 --> 22:44.628
I do.

22:44.630 --> 22:45.796
Guys!

22:45.798 --> 22:47.665
(all giggling)

22:47.667 --> 22:49.367
I do.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.769
Then I pronounce you
man and wife.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.706
You-- you may--

22:55.708 --> 22:57.308
yeah, but-- okay.

23:10.690 --> 23:11.789
Great.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.065
We did it!

23:21.067 --> 23:22.733
Wait, is Shawn my father now?

23:22.735 --> 23:23.567
Not officially.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.935
He would have to
adopt you first.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.670
-Get on it.
-I'm all over it.

23:27.774 --> 23:30.441
-Hello, my wife.
-Hello, my husband.

23:32.678 --> 23:33.844
Hello, my wife.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.146
What are you doing?

23:37.583 --> 23:40.718
Hey, where are you guys going
on your honeymoon?

23:40.720 --> 23:43.254
Shawn is taking me to Fiji.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.855
Take me to Fiji.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.791
You killed me, Shawn.

23:47.794 --> 23:48.859
You ready?

23:48.861 --> 23:50.995
For the rest of my life.

23:52.865 --> 23:56.700
Um, am I your daughter now?

23:56.702 --> 24:00.137
Well, it's how
I'd like to think of you.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.505
If it's okay.
