Sure.
Why not?

Well, it's about time.

02:50.375 --> 02:52.582
- Probably set something up.
- Yeah.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.749
Boss called me into his office
last night after you left.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.916
He thinks you did a great job
on the new campaign drawings,

02:56.917 --> 02:59.082
but we only have a couple of
hours to get it all finalized

02:59.083 --> 03:00.708
before the client starts
breathing down our necks.

03:00.709 --> 03:02.332
Sounds great.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.916
Are you listening to me?
I'm the account manager.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.499
It's my job to make sure
that the artists

03:05.500 --> 03:07.082
get their work done
in a timely manner...

03:07.083 --> 03:08.416
I know, Ed.
I'm sorry.

03:08.417 --> 03:09.916
Usually you and I
make such a great team.

03:09.917 --> 03:11.207
I'm just distracted.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.332
Why?

03:12.333 --> 03:13.457
I'm getting engaged.

03:13.458 --> 03:14.582
Oh, right.
That's today.

03:14.583 --> 03:16.040
Congratulations.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.624
Being in love is great
and so, so great,

03:17.625 --> 03:19.165
and rewarding and all that.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.708
There's definitely more to
life than being successful

03:20.709 --> 03:21.916
and excelling professionally.

03:21.917 --> 03:23.708
Not all of us can be
workaholics like you.

03:23.709 --> 03:26.624
Some of us need human
interaction, connection,

03:26.625 --> 03:28.667
dare I say love?

03:38.208 --> 03:39.624
Hey, Summer.

03:39.625 --> 03:42.290
Hey, just calling
to wish you luck on your test.

03:42.291 --> 03:43.874
Thank you.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.374
Hey, did you hear?

03:45.375 --> 03:47.499
Matt is gonna propose
to Alexis tonight.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.958
Did I hear?

03:48.959 --> 03:51.124
Matt is having me decorate
his and Adam's apartment

03:51.125 --> 03:53.791
for the after-proposal,
whatever that is.

03:53.792 --> 03:56.666
I'm so excited for him,
and it's so like Matt

03:56.667 --> 03:58.582
to propose the old-fashioned way.

03:58.583 --> 04:02.249
Well, he does take all
his cues from romantic movies.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.165
I wish a little of that
would rub off on Adam.

04:04.166 --> 04:06.040
He definitely needs it.

04:06.041 --> 04:07.332
All right, I'll see you soon.

04:07.333 --> 04:08.583
Bye, Summer.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.666
We're screenwriters, Adam.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.165
How could we overlook this?

04:16.166 --> 04:18.332
Where's the love story?

04:18.333 --> 04:20.541
Why does everything
have to have a love story?

04:20.541 --> 04:22.874
Even action-adventure movies
have romance, Adam.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.749
We should change that.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.040
You are so unromantic.

04:27.041 --> 04:29.040
What are you talking about?

04:29.041 --> 04:31.082
I got you flowers that one time.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.541
For my birthday two years ago.

04:33.542 --> 04:35.374
I love you.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.207
You and your chronically cold feet.

04:37.208 --> 04:38.290
Why don't you ever wear socks?

04:38.291 --> 04:40.541
I don't need socks.

04:40.542 --> 04:42.082
Aw, Matty, you look great.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.290
Dude, you're not actually

04:43.291 --> 04:44.541
gonna go through
with this, are you?

04:44.542 --> 04:45.958
What do you mean?

04:45.959 --> 04:47.374
Listen, Matthew...
and I'm calling you Matthew

04:47.375 --> 04:49.249
because this is serious.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.874
Why ruin a perfectly healthy,
happy relationship

04:51.875 --> 04:53.791
by signing a contract
and slapping on a title?

04:53.792 --> 04:56.541
I think it's sweet.

04:56.542 --> 04:58.374
The tux is overkill.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.916
This is how real men
used to dress,

04:59.917 --> 05:01.833
the romantic heroes
of the silver screen.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.708
Bogart, Gable, Grant.

05:04.709 --> 05:06.541
Well, you're gonna need
a grant to pay off that tux.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.666
Summer, will you please
tell your boyfriend

05:08.667 --> 05:09.874
that he doesn't know
what he's talking about?

05:09.875 --> 05:13.165
Adam, if you don't
stop being such a jerk

05:13.166 --> 05:15.249
and start being supportive,
I might just ask you

05:15.250 --> 05:16.250
when you're gonna propose to me.

05:16.251 --> 05:17.374
The tux looks great, buddy.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.041
Good luck tonight, man.
You got this.

05:24.208 --> 05:26.249
So this will be on your test.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.249
A chemical reaction, right?

05:28.250 --> 05:31.416
And another chemical reaction.

05:31.417 --> 05:33.207
That's right,
and it's gonna replace

05:33.208 --> 05:35.916
a certain number of S molecules.

05:35.917 --> 05:37.833
And in a given instant

05:37.834 --> 05:40.374
possesses enough energy to what?

05:40.375 --> 05:41.874
This is gonna be on your test.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.416
15 more minutes.

05:44.583 --> 05:46.542
Okay.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.582
We need to get the flowers
ready and leave soon.

06:08.583 --> 06:12.749
I can't believe that Matt
is proposing right now.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.624

special news to share

Matt, you need to go home.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.103
I'm not gonna lose you
without a fight.

16:32.375 --> 16:33.959
I need some space, Matt.

You're not the only one
going through this.

I'm sorry, man.

17:21.541 --> 17:26.582
Yeah, Katie, this phone call
I got was just nuts.

17:26.583 --> 17:29.374
You're getting back together?

17:29.375 --> 17:30.499
The relationship needs work.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.416
Dating Katie is work.

17:32.417 --> 17:34.625
Definitely get my attention.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.999
Yeah, so you know
what I'm saying.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.499
Yep, there you go.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.999
Thank you.
Looks good.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.290
- Excuse me.
- Hey, we were...

18:09.291 --> 18:11.165
- Is Liz working today?
- No, sorry.

18:11.166 --> 18:12.624
Okay, well, um,
maybe you can help me.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.666
I'm looking for my friend.
He's about this tall.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.624
He likes Americanos.
His name's Matt.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.666
I'm sorry, sir, but you're
gonna have to wait in line,

18:18.667 --> 18:21.499
which is a common practice in
establishments such as this one.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.666
Let me start over.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.332
Hi, Krista.
Beautiful name.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.541
I'm Eddie, the account manager
at Jump Over Fences Ad Agency

18:26.542 --> 18:28.040
down the street.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.874
My customers and clients
come in here every day.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.541
I, myself, prefer green juice.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.374
So this is my first time
in your lovely establishment,

18:33.375 --> 18:34.708
but by association, I bring in

18:34.709 --> 18:36.708
hundreds of thousands of
dollars in profit every year,

18:36.709 --> 18:39.249
so I'm partially responsible
for keeping this place afloat.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.249
As a thank you,
all you need to do

18:41.250 --> 18:43.582
is just listen to my question
and give me one quick answer.

18:43.583 --> 18:44.708
Coffee is the second-most
sought after commodity

18:44.709 --> 18:46.541
next to oil.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.541
The industry generates upwards
of 20 billion dollars a year.

18:48.542 --> 18:50.040
So if your company
is bringing in

18:50.041 --> 18:51.416
thousands of dollars of profit,

18:51.417 --> 18:52.499
it seems like your
employees don't just want

18:52.500 --> 18:54.874
their Café Connections
coffee, they need it.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.040
So you should be thanking me,

18:56.041 --> 18:59.374
not the other way around.

18:59.375 --> 19:02.040
I haven't seen Matt in a couple days.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.625
Now can you please step aside
so I can help the next customer?

19:07.500 --> 19:09.374
Hi.

19:09.375 --> 19:11.374
I can't believe Matt would do that.

19:11.375 --> 19:12.833
What was he thinking?

19:12.834 --> 19:14.874
I have no idea.

19:14.875 --> 19:17.624
This breakup has been
really tough on him.

19:17.625 --> 19:20.165
Did he really think
the boom box thing would work?

19:20.166 --> 19:22.666
Well, Matt's always
gone a little overboard

19:22.667 --> 19:24.499
with the romance stuff.

19:24.500 --> 19:27.874
In high school, he fell head
over heels for this one girl

19:27.875 --> 19:31.874
and literally rode up to school
on a horse to ask her to prom.

19:31.875 --> 19:35.457
Well, Matt was really helpful
to me after my breakup with Ben.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.416
I really want to do something
to help him through this.

19:37.417 --> 19:38.541
What are you thinking?

19:38.542 --> 19:40.082
He loves Americanos.

19:40.083 --> 19:43.040
Maybe I'll take him one tonight
and see if he wants to talk?

19:43.041 --> 19:44.416
That's a great idea.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.958
But good luck over there.

19:45.959 --> 19:46.959
He's a mess.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.582
Matt, it's me.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.541
Can I come in?

20:01.542 --> 20:03.666
Hey.

20:03.667 --> 20:04.833
Thanks.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.290
You're the best.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.749
Wow.
What happened in here?

20:08.750 --> 20:10.249
I cleaned.

20:11.750 --> 20:15.416
Didn't we just watch this a few days ago?

20:15.417 --> 20:17.207
Yeah, but romantic comedies
are always the best

20:17.208 --> 20:20.290
third or fourth time around.

20:20.291 --> 20:22.165
I hate to break it to you,

20:22.166 --> 20:24.708
but romantic comedies aren't real.

20:24.709 --> 20:27.916
They just make people believe
that love is some magical,

20:27.917 --> 20:29.332
mystical thing that
takes your breath away,

20:29.333 --> 20:32.416
but that's not what actually happens.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.290
They're kind of useless.

20:34.291 --> 20:36.457
They're not useless at all.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.457
I've been watching
these movies on repeat,

20:38.458 --> 20:40.791
and I've noticed some
patterns and devised a plan.

20:40.792 --> 20:42.874
What is the one thing all
these movies have in common?

20:42.875 --> 20:44.916
They make lonely people feel
worse about themselves?

20:44.917 --> 20:46.416
No.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.708
No, in these stories, the male interest

20:47.709 --> 20:49.916
always gets rejected by his soul mate.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.541
- First he's in denial.
- Check.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.708
- And then he wallows.
- Check, check.

20:53.709 --> 20:55.499
And then he gets back out there.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.500
Well?

20:56.501 --> 20:57.708
That's my next step.

20:57.709 --> 20:58.916
I've got to take charge of my life.

20:58.917 --> 21:00.374
I've got to get out of this apartment,

21:00.375 --> 21:02.040
change my surroundings.

21:02.041 --> 21:04.165
I am gonna live a romantic comedy,

21:04.166 --> 21:05.916
and I am gonna get back
with my soul mate.

21:05.917 --> 21:07.207
Don't you want to actually move on

21:07.208 --> 21:08.874
instead of just hoping
to get back together?

21:08.875 --> 21:10.249
You know what?

21:10.250 --> 21:11.999
You should embark on this
journey with me.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.290
It'd be good for you too.

21:13.291 --> 21:16.416
No, I don't know.

21:16.417 --> 21:18.082
We could do singles things together.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.582
We could be each other wingmen.

21:19.583 --> 21:21.582
In these movies, the male lead
always has a best friend,

21:21.583 --> 21:25.207
and you could be my partner in crime.

21:25.208 --> 21:26.374
Come on!

21:26.375 --> 21:27.375
You never have any fun.

21:27.376 --> 21:30.082
You're always studying or working.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.749
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt,

21:31.750 --> 21:33.791
and I do need to forget about Ben.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.791
I still can't get over that rejection.

21:35.792 --> 21:37.749
We're gonna go out.
We're gonna meet new people.

21:37.750 --> 21:39.874
We're gonna have fun, and we re
gonna mend our broken hearts.

21:39.875 --> 21:41.082
Okay?

21:41.083 --> 21:42.083
Okay.

21:42.084 --> 21:44.207
Okay, let's go.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.290
♪ Yeah, yeah ♪

21:49.291 --> 21:51.040
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:51.041 --> 21:53.916
- Hey.
- Hey, where's Matt?

21:53.917 --> 21:54.999
He's getting drinks.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.124
I got your text.

21:56.125 --> 21:58.666
How did you convince him to come out?

21:58.667 --> 22:00.708
Oh, I didn't.
He convinced me.

22:00.709 --> 22:02.874
That doesn't sound like Matt, unless...

22:02.875 --> 22:04.582
He has a plan.

22:04.583 --> 22:06.165
Yeah.
I'll let him explain.

22:06.166 --> 22:07.374
Hello.

22:07.375 --> 22:11.082
Would you care to join me
on the floor of dance?

22:11.083 --> 22:13.582
Oh, thank you so much
for asking, but I...

22:13.583 --> 22:14.833
She would love to.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.082
Oh, but I was just gonna...

22:16.083 --> 22:18.082
No buts.
Go have fun.

22:18.083 --> 22:19.499
You are the worst.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.874
Hey, guys.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.666
Hey.
How's it going?

22:24.667 --> 22:26.582
Good.
Good, good.

22:26.583 --> 22:29.250
Everything is great and going
according to plan.

22:33.083 --> 22:35.833
Oh, and pray tell,
what exactly is this plan?

22:35.834 --> 22:37.416
Look, you know the saying you
don't know what you have

22:37.417 --> 22:38.958
until it's gone?

22:38.959 --> 22:41.290
In a lot of these rom-coms,
when a guy gets a new girlfriend

22:41.291 --> 22:43.791
or he acts like
he doesn't care as much,

22:43.792 --> 22:45.416
that's when the ex
wants him back.

22:45.417 --> 22:48.958
So when I meet these new women,
Alexis will resurface.

22:48.959 --> 22:50.916
Being desirable, not desperate.

22:50.917 --> 22:52.791
Exactly.

22:52.792 --> 22:54.624
And if I play my cards right,

22:54.625 --> 22:56.082
she ll be on my arm by the reunion.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.582
That might actually work.

22:57.583 --> 22:59.416
As long as you're happy
and out of the house.

22:59.417 --> 23:01.749
But the reunion is

for you to bring her.

Oh, so happy to hear that.

24:43.208 --> 24:44.290
So what do you write?

Oh, like, action-adventure, mostly.

24:46.291 --> 24:48.416
With a little romance sprinkled in.

32:44.959 --> 32:46.791
but when it comes to marketing,

32:46.792 --> 32:48.374
you know that s
not my area of expertise.

32:48.375 --> 32:49.708
Uh-huh.

32:49.709 --> 32:52.624
But it just so happens one
of my best buds is amazing

32:52.625 --> 32:54.040
at helping businesses thrive

32:54.041 --> 32:56.207
through creative advertising,

32:56.208 --> 33:00.332
experimental strategy, events.

33:00.333 --> 33:01.874
He's the king of rebrand.

33:01.875 --> 33:03.874
Who is this guy?
He sounds like a real winner.

33:03.875 --> 33:05.165
What do you say?

33:05.166 --> 33:06.374
I've just got so much to do
here, you know?

33:06.375 --> 33:08.999
- I'm sorry, man.
- Eddie, please.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.874
You're a tenacious worker.

33:10.875 --> 33:12.582
You manage the top accounts.

33:12.583 --> 33:14.082
We need you.

33:14.083 --> 33:17.500
You could be the Robin Hood of advertising.

33:25.208 --> 33:26.874
I'll go over there tomorrow.

33:26.875 --> 33:28.040
Yeah?

33:28.041 --> 33:29.541
Yeah.

33:29.542 --> 33:30.749
Thank you.

33:30.750 --> 33:31.916
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

33:31.917 --> 33:33.708
Frank's gonna be so happy.

33:33.709 --> 33:36.249
Thank you!

33:36.250 --> 33:38.583
Robin Hood of advertising.

33:40.875 --> 33:43.625
Has a nice ring to it.

33:46.959 --> 33:48.958
- I need help.
- What's up?

33:48.959 --> 33:52.082
I'm about to get engaged,
and I have nothing to wear.

33:52.083 --> 33:53.624
Okay, deep breaths.

33:53.625 --> 33:55.624
You know that he loves you
no matter what you wear.

33:55.625 --> 33:57.124
Right.
Thanks.

33:57.125 --> 33:58.582
So can I call you after?

33:58.583 --> 34:00.999
You'd better!
I want to hear all the details.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.040
I'll be back around 11:00.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.040
11:00?
Where are you going?

34:04.041 --> 34:05.874
Um, I'm not really sure.

34:05.875 --> 34:08.498
I'm meeting Matt to work
on his plan to win Alexis back.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.206
Okay, I really don't understand his plan.

34:11.208 --> 34:13.708
So he wants to move on with his life

34:13.708 --> 34:16.623
so Alexis will see
that he's happy without her

34:16.625 --> 34:18.708
and magically come back to him?

34:18.708 --> 34:20.248
I think so?

34:20.250 --> 34:22.416
He's really been watching
too many of those movies.

34:22.417 --> 34:23.623
Happy pre-engagement!

34:23.625 --> 34:25.456
Eee! Thank you!

34:27.083 --> 34:28.542
Oh.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.416
What? No.

34:32.417 --> 34:34.331
Speed-dating?
I'm not doing this.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.748
Oh, well, I already signed us up.

34:35.750 --> 34:37.708
What terrible movie gave you this idea?

34:37.708 --> 34:41.081
None. I came up with
this one all by myself.

34:41.083 --> 34:43.373
- Hi. Liz Brown.
- Mm-hmm. Checking in?

34:43.375 --> 34:45.041
And this is me.

34:52.542 --> 34:53.873
Come on.

34:56.458 --> 34:59.916
I'm Liz.

35:01.458 --> 35:03.165
Hi.
I'm Matt.

35:03.166 --> 35:04.333
Hi.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.708
So what brings you
speed-dating, huh?

35:13.333 --> 35:14.374
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

35:14.375 --> 35:15.749
Excuse me?

35:15.750 --> 35:17.582
Never mind.

35:20.208 --> 35:22.207
Hi.
I'm Matt.

35:28.709 --> 35:29.999
You've been busy, huh?

35:30.000 --> 35:30.875
Oh.

35:30.876 --> 35:32.749
David and Penelope.

35:32.750 --> 35:36.040
This is our newest baby, oh.

35:36.041 --> 35:37.041
Hey, I'm Eric.

35:37.042 --> 35:38.499
Hey.
Do you want to leave?

35:38.500 --> 35:41.207
- Yes.
- Okay.

35:41.208 --> 35:44.666
When you suggested
an intimate date night,

35:44.667 --> 35:46.708
fast food wasn't the first thing
that came to my mind.

35:46.709 --> 35:47.874
What are you talking about?

35:47.875 --> 35:50.040
Ketchup-smothered fried goodness

35:50.041 --> 35:52.791
doesn't scream romance to you?

35:52.792 --> 35:54.582
No, I... I guess you're right,

35:54.583 --> 35:56.582
I mean, as long as we re
together, it's romantic.

35:56.583 --> 35:57.624
Yeah.

35:57.625 --> 35:59.040
It's just nice to finally spend

35:59.041 --> 36:01.040
some quality one-on-one time together

36:01.041 --> 36:03.457
without our faces buried in laptops.

36:03.458 --> 36:05.207
Exactly.

36:05.208 --> 36:07.499
I just hope I got a toy.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.833
You are such a man-child.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.749
And proud of it.

36:10.750 --> 36:12.833
Oh, yes!

36:12.834 --> 36:14.499
This is awesome!

36:15.750 --> 36:17.207
Ah.

36:17.208 --> 36:19.416
What'd you get?

36:19.417 --> 36:21.083
I don't know.

36:22.792 --> 36:24.207
What is this?

36:24.208 --> 36:25.874
I don't know.
Why don't you open it up?

36:25.875 --> 36:27.541
You never do anything like this.

36:27.542 --> 36:31.124
Well, I love you.

36:31.125 --> 36:33.791
So I just wanted to get
you a little something

36:33.792 --> 36:35.417
to show you that.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.749
Socks?

36:44.750 --> 36:47.708
Yeah, because of your feet.

36:47.709 --> 36:51.833
Aren't they soft?
Yeah.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.082
What's wrong?

36:53.083 --> 36:55.708
I thought it was...

36:55.709 --> 36:57.624
I need a minute.

36:57.625 --> 36:59.958
What-what are you doing?

36:59.959 --> 37:03.457
You didn't even touch your food!

37:03.458 --> 37:05.290
Charming.

37:05.291 --> 37:06.624
Oh, man.

37:06.625 --> 37:07.958
- Meredith.
- Meredith!

37:07.959 --> 37:09.207
- Oh, Mer.
- Oh, Mer.

37:09.208 --> 37:12.332
That Meredith.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.749
Oh, hey, how about Sir Talks-a lot?

37:14.750 --> 37:17.749
He was a stellar guy.
Great listener.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.999
It was amazing to watch.
He never even...

37:20.000 --> 37:21.833
You look beautiful tonight.

37:21.834 --> 37:23.582
You know that, right?

37:23.583 --> 37:24.666
Susan?

37:24.667 --> 37:25.999
No, um...

37:26.000 --> 37:27.165
What?

37:27.166 --> 37:28.666
It's my ex.

37:28.667 --> 37:30.207
Huh?

37:30.208 --> 37:31.666
It's Ben.
He's here.

37:31.667 --> 37:32.833
I don't... I don't want him to see me.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.749
I'm a lucky guy.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.999
Uh, too late.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.040
Hey.

37:40.041 --> 37:41.541
How are you, Lizzie?

37:41.542 --> 37:43.374
I'm great.
I'm good.

37:43.375 --> 37:47.165
Uh, this is Rachel,
my, uh... my girlfriend.

37:47.166 --> 37:48.833
This is Matt.

37:48.834 --> 37:49.999
Yeah, I remember.
Yeah.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.332
We, uh... we met
once or twice, right?

37:52.333 --> 37:54.124
- Yeah, nice to see you, Matt.
- Yeah.

37:54.125 --> 37:56.249
Can you believe they do
speed-dating in here?

37:56.250 --> 37:57.874
Pretty lame, right?

37:57.875 --> 38:00.332
Ben.

38:00.333 --> 38:02.708
You guys did that?

38:02.709 --> 38:06.040
- Yeah, we...
- No, we're together.

38:06.041 --> 38:09.040
We just came from a work
function, hence the nametags.

38:09.041 --> 38:10.666
Yeah, that s, uh...
that's what we're doing here.

38:10.667 --> 38:13.040
Whoo, I mean, that could
have been really awkward.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.457
Yeah, it could have been.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.040
I wouldn't be caught dead speed-dating.

38:16.041 --> 38:17.791
I mean, I feel so bad
for the people that do.

38:17.792 --> 38:20.207
Yeah, so embarrassing.

38:20.208 --> 38:23.791
Um, so we ll, uh...
we ll see you around, I guess.

38:23.792 --> 38:25.709
Bye.

38:34.625 --> 38:36.165
You okay?

38:36.166 --> 38:38.666
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm great.

38:38.667 --> 38:40.583
Do you want to sit down for a little bit?

38:45.750 --> 38:48.916
Hey, Summer.

38:48.917 --> 38:50.666
Come...

38:50.667 --> 38:53.749
Man, I really need
to get into better shape.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.082
What-what did I do?

38:55.083 --> 38:56.874
I just... I need to be alone.

38:56.875 --> 38:57.916
A guy does something nice for
you, and this is how you react?

38:57.917 --> 38:59.582
Something nice, Adam?

38:59.583 --> 39:03.332
I thought you were gonna propose.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.666
Why-why would you think that?

39:04.667 --> 39:06.457
I don't know.

39:06.458 --> 39:10.082
Maybe because I found your
list that mentioned champagne

39:10.083 --> 39:12.457
and a gift and dinner,

39:12.458 --> 39:14.499
but I never should have paid
attention to any of that.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.708
I'm more than committed to you, okay?

39:17.709 --> 39:20.582
I just don't see how signing
papers and wearing rings

39:20.583 --> 39:23.541
is gonna do anything for us.

39:23.542 --> 39:25.290
Fine.

39:25.291 --> 39:28.082
I will see you for our
writing session tomorrow.

39:28.083 --> 39:29.959
Hey, come on.

39:33.625 --> 39:35.999
I can't believe that s
the guy who broke my heart

39:36.000 --> 39:39.749
and dumped me after two years.

39:39.750 --> 39:42.874
It's like you have this strong
connection with someone,

39:42.875 --> 39:44.457
and then you see that person,

39:44.458 --> 39:46.500
and it's like you're looking at a stranger.

39:49.750 --> 39:51.874
When did you know
you were in love with him?

39:51.875 --> 39:53.332
It's not like the movies.

39:53.333 --> 39:55.040
I didn't have that struck-by-lightning,

39:55.041 --> 39:57.374
a-ha moment.

39:57.375 --> 40:01.582
I think it's something
that happens overtime.

40:01.583 --> 40:04.624
Did you want to marry him?

40:04.625 --> 40:06.666
I know I don't seem like
the type that wants that

40:06.667 --> 40:08.874
or even wants to get married,

40:08.875 --> 40:11.082
and I don't just for the sake of it,

40:11.083 --> 40:15.207
but I think everyone wants love.

40:15.208 --> 40:18.124
Forget that guy, okay?

40:18.125 --> 40:20.375
You're beautiful, and you're
smart, and you're amazing.

40:23.125 --> 40:25.332
And you don't deserve
to be with someone

40:25.333 --> 40:28.708
who's too foolish to see that.

40:28.709 --> 40:30.582
Thanks.

40:30.583 --> 40:32.463
That's the second time
you've said that tonight.

40:33.458 --> 40:35.416
I know.
You're on a roll.

40:35.417 --> 40:36.834
I know.

40:41.542 --> 40:42.916
If you're not gonna
alter your product

40:42.917 --> 40:44.290
to reflect the times,

40:44.291 --> 40:45.541
you've got to change
your demographic

40:45.542 --> 40:46.624
or your marketing tactic.

40:46.625 --> 40:48.457
What exactly are you selling?

40:48.458 --> 40:51.207
Well, I rent videos.

40:51.208 --> 40:54.040
Right, but what else?

40:54.041 --> 40:55.666
Uh...

40:55.667 --> 40:59.416
Well, I guess it's a feeling of...

40:59.417 --> 41:00.375
Camaraderie?

41:00.376 --> 41:01.666
Yes.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.207
Okay, so you're selling a warm,

41:03.208 --> 41:05.082
inviting neighborhood place,

41:05.083 --> 41:06.833
an opportunity to make friends,

41:06.834 --> 41:07.874
a chance to fall in love.

41:07.875 --> 41:09.332
- Yes.
- Yes.

41:09.333 --> 41:10.874
Oh, hi, Krista.

41:10.875 --> 41:12.582
Hi, Frank.

41:12.583 --> 41:13.749
You didn't come in for your
morning coffee today,

41:13.750 --> 41:15.165
so I thought I'd bring it
to you on my break.

41:15.166 --> 41:16.249
Oh, see, she does this
every time I don't show.

41:16.250 --> 41:18.416
She is a very aggressive barista.

41:18.417 --> 41:20.374
So what are you boys up to anyway?

41:20.375 --> 41:21.541
Getting ready to close your shop?

41:21.542 --> 41:23.874
Uh, no, actually, change of plan.

41:23.875 --> 41:25.582
Eddie here's gonna help
me market the place

41:25.583 --> 41:26.874
to get more customers.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.708
It's a last-ditch effort, I suppose.

41:28.709 --> 41:30.916
I didn't realize your services
were so affordable,

41:30.917 --> 41:33.582
given that you're such a big,
important executive.

41:33.583 --> 41:36.457
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He wouldn't charge me a dime.

41:36.458 --> 41:39.249
He does it out of
the goodness of his heart.

41:39.250 --> 41:42.624
Well, I'll let you two
get back to it.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.000
See you.

41:56.917 --> 41:57.958
Hey, Summer.

41:57.959 --> 41:59.124
Hey, babe.

41:59.125 --> 42:01.499
Hello, Matt.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.165
I wasn't expecting you
this early.

42:03.166 --> 42:04.958
- What's up?
- Nothing.

42:04.959 --> 42:06.374
I have plans today,

42:06.375 --> 42:09.083
so I want to finish the
B story in a few hours.

42:13.667 --> 42:15.999
Hey.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.958
You're sweet.

42:19.959 --> 42:22.708
We are out of coffee,
so I'm gonna go grab some.

42:22.709 --> 42:24.290
Good luck on breaking the story,

42:24.291 --> 42:25.571
if that's what you guys call it.

42:42.583 --> 42:43.999
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.082
- How are you?
- I'm amazing.

42:46.083 --> 42:47.207
On cloud nine.

42:47.208 --> 42:48.791
I just booked a gig,
and guess what.

42:48.792 --> 42:50.207
What?

42:50.208 --> 42:51.833
It's a role
with depth and gravitas.

42:51.834 --> 42:55.040
I get to show my range,
and I am just so excited.

42:55.041 --> 42:56.416
Well, congrats.

42:56.417 --> 42:57.666
Why aren't you out celebrating?

42:57.667 --> 42:59.249
I thought Liz was supposed to be here.

42:59.250 --> 43:00.916
She called in sick this morning,

43:00.917 --> 43:02.499
so I'm covering her shift, poor thing.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.332
I should go check on her, all right?

43:04.333 --> 43:05.749
I'll see you later.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.332
- Bye.
- Bye.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.040
Who is it?

43:11.041 --> 43:13.040
Your personal MD for the evening.

43:13.041 --> 43:15.000
Even doctors need doctors, right?

43:22.583 --> 43:24.040
How did you know I was sick?

43:24.041 --> 43:25.207
Krista told me.

43:25.208 --> 43:27.207
I got worried, so I came
to take care of you.

43:27.208 --> 43:29.874
Brought you some soup and
a couple of my favorite movies

43:29.875 --> 43:31.290
to cheer you up.

43:31.291 --> 43:32.708
Thanks, but I'm fine, really.

43:32.709 --> 43:33.916
You're not fine.

43:33.917 --> 43:35.957
Let me see if I can make
my way around your kitchen.

43:39.542 --> 43:40.582
You want some tea?

43:40.583 --> 43:42.207
Yeah, I just put some water on.

43:42.208 --> 43:43.708
Perfect.

43:43.709 --> 43:46.000
Sit down, relax.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.541
Do you want honey?

43:49.542 --> 43:51.125
Yes, please.

43:56.250 --> 43:58.582
Okay.

43:58.583 --> 43:59.874
Here you go.

43:59.875 --> 44:01.792
Thank you.

44:04.875 --> 44:08.207
Let me feel your head.

44:08.208 --> 44:10.874
That feels like
you might have a fever,

44:10.875 --> 44:12.916
but I guess you'd know that, right?

44:12.917 --> 44:15.582
I'm just clammy.

44:15.583 --> 44:17.874
Here.

44:17.875 --> 44:19.332
You don't have to do that.

44:19.333 --> 44:21.916
No, you have to let people
take care of you sometimes, Liz.

44:21.917 --> 44:24.916
It's okay.

44:24.917 --> 44:27.375
Here, put this on your head.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.374
You're gonna feel much better.

44:31.375 --> 44:32.916
Just in time for the reunion.

44:32.917 --> 44:34.749
Don't think I forgot.

44:34.750 --> 44:36.332
You don't need to worry
about the reunion.

44:36.333 --> 44:39.040
You need to worry about sleep.
You work too much.

44:39.041 --> 44:40.916
The coffee shop, school...

44:40.917 --> 44:42.040
Winning back your girlfriend.

44:42.041 --> 44:43.582
Oh, there she is.

44:44.917 --> 44:46.666
Hey, I'm just sick.

44:46.667 --> 44:48.667
I see that.

44:55.542 --> 44:57.207
Okay.

44:57.208 --> 45:00.165
Just sit back, relax,
and enjoy the show.

45:04.583 --> 45:12.250
♪ ♪

45:20.166 --> 45:21.916
How are you feeling?

45:21.917 --> 45:25.457
I've been better.

45:25.458 --> 45:26.708
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

45:26.709 --> 45:28.165
For what?

45:28.166 --> 45:29.791
That you're upset.

45:29.792 --> 45:31.207
That I upset you.

45:31.208 --> 45:32.541
Thank you.

45:32.542 --> 45:34.708
I appreciate your apology but, I mean,

45:34.709 --> 45:37.708
that doesn't change or fix anything.

45:37.709 --> 45:40.249
We're stuck, and I don't know.

45:40.250 --> 45:42.541
I'm starting to think that maybe...

45:42.542 --> 45:45.040
maybe we'd be better off
if we moved on.

45:45.041 --> 45:46.457
I-I don't want to move on...

45:46.458 --> 45:47.499
Look, that's not what I'm saying.

45:47.500 --> 45:48.500
Then what are you saying?

45:48.501 --> 45:49.874
Is this about the reunion?

45:49.875 --> 45:51.499
Okay.

45:51.500 --> 45:54.457
I am going to finish
writing for today from home.

45:54.458 --> 45:57.040
I will e-mail you when
I'm done with the scenes,

45:57.041 --> 45:58.541
and when we're done with
this script then, you know,

45:58.542 --> 45:59.999
we can just both go our separate ways.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.374
I thought we were having a discussion.

46:01.375 --> 46:03.332
We ve been doing this for a decade, Adam.

46:03.333 --> 46:04.917
I can't do this limbo anymore.

46:13.625 --> 46:15.040
Hey, man.

46:15.041 --> 46:16.165
Is Summer okay?

46:16.166 --> 46:17.959
I'm going for a drive.

46:24.834 --> 46:26.083
Forget your keys?

46:29.333 --> 46:31.207
Hi.

46:31.208 --> 46:33.083
Hi.

46:35.750 --> 46:37.709
Matt?

47:00.083 --> 47:01.999
Yeah, I'm so sorry about just dropping by.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.124
I know I should have called.

47:03.125 --> 47:04.541
I just was in the area, and...

47:04.542 --> 47:05.624
It's okay.

47:05.625 --> 47:08.708
I understand work emergencies.

47:08.709 --> 47:12.082
Yeah, there's no way to alter
a dress design for a client

47:12.083 --> 47:15.165
without my swatches and my sewing kit.

47:15.166 --> 47:18.332
Oh, and, um, here's this too.

47:18.333 --> 47:20.374
Oh, no, no, no.
You keep that.

47:20.375 --> 47:22.749
You love that thing.
You should have it.

47:22.750 --> 47:24.249
I do wear it a lot.

47:24.250 --> 47:26.124
Yeah.

47:26.125 --> 47:27.375
Thank you.

47:30.875 --> 47:33.333
I will give him a happy home.

47:38.458 --> 47:41.082
So this is it, huh?

47:42.291 --> 47:44.083
Matt, I, um...

47:48.208 --> 47:50.916
I-I didn't actually need

47:50.917 --> 47:53.124
any of this stuff tonight.

47:53.125 --> 47:55.374
What do you mean?

47:55.375 --> 47:58.958
I just really missed you,

47:58.959 --> 48:02.874
and I wanted
an excuse to see you.

48:02.875 --> 48:04.290
I know that's lame.

48:04.291 --> 48:08.124
No, no, it's not lame.
I miss you.

48:08.125 --> 48:11.332
A lot.

48:11.333 --> 48:12.833
I should go.

48:12.834 --> 48:15.457
I do actually have to do some work.

48:15.458 --> 48:17.624
You know, the whole freelance
thing, always on the clock.

48:17.625 --> 48:19.959
I understand.

48:37.417 --> 48:39.834
It's really good to see you, Matt.

48:41.417 --> 48:43.000
It was good to see you too.

48:45.500 --> 48:46.500
Bye.

48:46.501 --> 48:48.166
Bye.

48:54.667 --> 48:55.999
Yes!

48:57.250 --> 48:59.166
She misses me.

49:02.625 --> 49:04.833
Hey, over here!

49:04.834 --> 49:06.708
You look good, man!

49:06.709 --> 49:08.624
Well, I knew it was
gonna work all along.

49:08.625 --> 49:10.499
- My plan's working.
- Wait, but I don't get it.

49:10.500 --> 49:12.666
I thought you said that
you had to get over Alexis

49:12.667 --> 49:15.499
or get a new girlfriend
in order for her to come back.

49:15.500 --> 49:18.207
She's starting to realize that
I might not always be around.

49:18.208 --> 49:20.207
She doesn't want to lose me for good,

49:20.208 --> 49:21.666
so I think I'll hear from her soon.

49:21.667 --> 49:24.124
Just like in the movies, and
just in time for the reunion,

49:24.125 --> 49:25.374
as promised.

49:25.375 --> 49:26.833
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:26.834 --> 49:29.124
So if you inadvertently
make a girl jealous,

49:29.125 --> 49:30.541
she ll notice you?

49:30.542 --> 49:32.125
Definitely.

49:35.291 --> 49:36.457
Where you going?

49:36.458 --> 49:37.833
I got some work to do.

49:37.834 --> 49:40.332
- Come on.
- Bye.

49:40.333 --> 49:42.374
Socks.

49:42.375 --> 49:43.833
I couldn't believe it.

49:43.834 --> 49:45.749
I felt so stupid.

49:45.750 --> 49:48.499
You're not stupid.

49:48.500 --> 49:50.582
He clearly loves you,
and he ll come around and...

49:50.583 --> 49:52.999
No.
No, I'm done.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.916
I-I don't want
to wait another ten years

49:54.917 --> 49:56.416
for him to change his mind.

49:56.417 --> 49:58.040
I'm sorry, Summer.

49:58.041 --> 50:02.040
I need him to put our love in
front of his own insecurities.

50:02.041 --> 50:04.499
I just don't always want
to feel like I'm second-best.

50:04.500 --> 50:08.249
No one does.

50:08.250 --> 50:09.959
Hey.

50:18.417 --> 50:22.207
Here, babe.
Let me get that for you.

50:22.208 --> 50:23.416
Evening, Eddie.

50:23.417 --> 50:25.457
Oh, hey.
How's it going?

50:25.458 --> 50:27.541
Living the dream, per usual.
And who's this?

50:27.542 --> 50:30.749
- I'm actually on a date.
- Really?

50:30.750 --> 50:33.416
Sorry, we don't mean to be so
in love right in front of you.

50:33.417 --> 50:34.708
No, no.
It's fine.

50:34.709 --> 50:36.541
You guys seem like
a really great couple.

50:36.542 --> 50:38.374
Yeah, we are.

50:38.375 --> 50:39.541
So what can I get you two lovebirds?

50:39.542 --> 50:43.624
We will have two green teas.

50:43.625 --> 50:44.874
She ll be paying for herself.

50:44.875 --> 50:45.959
Ugh.
What?

50:51.583 --> 50:53.874
I'm really glad we're doing this.

50:53.875 --> 50:57.708
I've never gone stag before.
Just makes me kind of nervous.

50:57.709 --> 50:59.624
If I go to the reunion alone,
I want to look good.

50:59.625 --> 51:01.916
Oh, trust me.
You will.

51:01.917 --> 51:03.416
Yeah, and thanks
for helping me too.

51:03.417 --> 51:05.958
I spend most of my time
in scrubs or an apron,

51:05.959 --> 51:07.999
so I have no fashion sense.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.874
What is that?

51:09.875 --> 51:11.833
This is my prom dress,
and I think it's perfect.

51:11.834 --> 51:13.207
What, are you 16?

51:13.208 --> 51:15.457
Oh, come on.
It's a statement piece.

51:15.458 --> 51:16.666
I think you should wear it.

51:16.667 --> 51:19.708
Ha, that is a great idea, Liz.

51:19.709 --> 51:22.624
All the boys will flock to me out of pity.

51:22.625 --> 51:25.124
See?
That's the spirit.

51:25.125 --> 51:26.624
Okay, well, I should get going.

51:26.625 --> 51:27.958
My shift is starting.

51:27.959 --> 51:29.457
But why don't you show
me the other option?

51:29.458 --> 51:31.375
Okay.

51:43.959 --> 51:45.541
I think you should call him, Summer.

51:45.542 --> 51:48.541
I mean, it's clear you guys
are meant to be together.

51:48.542 --> 51:50.124
You shouldn't let this
get in the way of that.

51:50.125 --> 51:51.958
I don't know.

51:51.959 --> 51:55.791
It's obvious that we want
different things out of life.

51:55.792 --> 52:00.082
And he shouldn't be running
from the person he loves.

52:00.083 --> 52:03.374
I've grown up,
and he should too.

52:03.375 --> 52:04.999
That's the one.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.375
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:19.417 --> 52:21.541
No way!
We didn't.

52:30.709 --> 52:32.958
- Little grandchildren.
- We can't say no.

52:32.959 --> 52:34.290
- We have to accept.
- Mm-hmm.

52:36.375 --> 52:39.582
So I think I found the perfect
dress for the reunion.

52:39.583 --> 52:40.958
- I think you ll love it.
- I'm sure I will.

52:40.959 --> 52:43.249
Hey.

52:43.250 --> 52:44.749
Hey.
I didn't see you there.

52:44.750 --> 52:46.582
Hi.

52:46.583 --> 52:47.583
Alexis.

52:47.584 --> 52:48.791
Hi!
I'm Liz.

52:48.792 --> 52:50.541
I think we ve met
a couple of times.

52:50.542 --> 52:52.624
Do you mind if
I borrow him for a moment?

52:52.625 --> 52:53.874
Yeah, no, that's fine.

52:53.875 --> 52:55.416
I have to get back
to studying anyway,

52:55.417 --> 52:58.874
and Matt can be
such a distraction.

52:58.875 --> 53:00.499
Can I talk to you outside?

53:00.500 --> 53:01.666
Um...

53:01.667 --> 53:03.791
Um, I'll see you later, right?

53:03.792 --> 53:05.709
Yeah, see you then.

53:11.458 --> 53:13.457
So what's happening later?

53:13.458 --> 53:15.332
We're gonna go visit Frank.

53:15.333 --> 53:17.165
Eddie did some rebranding on Meet Cute,

53:17.166 --> 53:19.916
so I'm gonna check in
and see how it's progressing.

53:19.917 --> 53:21.082
What did you want to talk about?

53:21.083 --> 53:23.374
What you looking at, creeper?

53:23.375 --> 53:24.916
Nothing.

53:24.917 --> 53:27.332
Oh, that is not fun to watch,
but it's probably nothing.

53:27.333 --> 53:28.791
They're just talking.

53:28.792 --> 53:30.457
But I want it to be
something for Matt's sake.

53:30.458 --> 53:32.416
Speaking of Matt,

53:32.417 --> 53:34.582
what do you think
about his friend Eddie?

53:34.583 --> 53:35.833
The weird one?

53:35.834 --> 53:37.708
Yeah.
He's kind of cute, right?

53:39.500 --> 53:41.708
Krista Chapman, you little minx.

53:43.583 --> 53:46.082
I've been doing a lot of thinking,

53:46.083 --> 53:48.791
and I took you for granted,

53:48.792 --> 53:52.624
and I don't want to do that again.

53:52.625 --> 53:56.833
I'm so sorry for everything, Matt.

53:56.834 --> 54:00.374
I love you.

54:00.375 --> 54:03.374
Let's get back together.

54:03.375 --> 54:04.375
Really?

54:04.376 --> 54:06.999
Really.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.708
Unless... unless you don't want that.

54:09.709 --> 54:12.916
It is what I wanted.

54:12.917 --> 54:14.834
You're the one I want.

54:21.333 --> 54:23.582

56:12.583 --> 56:14.040
No, that's great.

That's what you wanted

Yeah.

No, totally cool.

Where's your girlfriend?

57:20.709 --> 57:22.165
She's busy.

57:22.166 --> 57:23.541
Uh, she had a
prior engagement, uh...

57:23.542 --> 57:24.542
Okay.

57:24.543 --> 57:26.749
Krista, I have a confession to make.

57:26.750 --> 57:28.499
That was not my girlfriend,

and that feels really good
to get off my chest.

57:30.208 --> 57:31.541
Really?
Then who was she?

57:31.542 --> 57:32.999
Jacqueline's a friend from work.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.207
She was pretending for me

57:35.208 --> 57:36.541
I don't know.
I'm really sorry.

57:36.542 --> 57:38.499

57:50.375 --> 57:51.833
Yes.

58:01.625 --> 58:02.833

the same approach

58:30.917 --> 58:32.541

- Cool.

Yeah, I don't think I need it anymore.
