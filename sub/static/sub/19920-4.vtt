WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:01.492
Previously on "Shots Fired"...

00:01.516 --> 00:04.094
Lieutenant Breeland found marijuana
in his search of the vehicle.

00:04.156 --> 00:05.499
And you sent him to get the weed.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.170
No. The house voted for barbecue,

00:07.195 --> 00:09.188
and Jesse, he volunteered to go get it.

00:09.213 --> 00:10.814
Toxicology report for Jesse Carr.

00:10.839 --> 00:12.322
No traces of marijuana in his system.

00:12.347 --> 00:13.907
Lieutenant Breeland threatened Shameeka

00:13.974 --> 00:16.190
to keep quiet
about her son's murder... why?

00:16.259 --> 00:19.194
I'm just trying to get my head
around why a former cop

00:19.262 --> 00:21.797
who killed an unarmed teenager
and didn't get prosecuted

00:21.865 --> 00:23.162
is now working cops.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.802
I just go after bad guys.

00:24.872 --> 00:27.139
I think Beck's a good cop
in a bad department.

00:27.270 --> 00:28.437
We need to work both cases.

00:28.505 --> 00:29.638
Jesse's case and Joey's.

00:29.706 --> 00:31.307
The police union is dropping you.

00:31.374 --> 00:33.609
They don't want to look like
they condone what you said.

00:33.677 --> 00:35.477
This correctional facility

00:35.545 --> 00:37.713
will bring thousands of jobs
to this state.

00:37.781 --> 00:39.648
This is Shawn, my youngest.

00:39.716 --> 00:41.227
Thank you for coming
to visit us, Governor.

00:41.251 --> 00:42.484
What do you really want?

00:42.552 --> 00:45.020
I want you, Governor Eamons,
to serve as well.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.956
Cory... no one's seen him.

00:47.023 --> 00:48.691
How long's he been gone?

00:48.758 --> 00:49.959
Ever since he talked to you.

00:50.026 --> 00:51.694
I thought you were here for Jesse Carr.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.295
Why are you looking at Joey Campbell?

00:57.367 --> 00:59.301
Cory?

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.314 --> 01:13.082
Hey.

01:16.048 --> 01:21.954
Proceed about three-tenths
of a mile to U.S. Route 74 East.

01:27.769 --> 01:29.832
In a quarter mile, turn left.

02:03.199 --> 02:05.801
Tell him what you told me.

02:05.869 --> 02:08.070
I was riding home on my bike

02:08.138 --> 02:10.104
after playing video games
at my boy's house.

02:12.542 --> 02:14.576
I was going fast 'cause it was 10:00

02:14.644 --> 02:16.679
and I told my parents
I'd be home by 9:00.

02:18.581 --> 02:21.417
Then, out of nowhere, this car
rolled up across the street,

02:21.484 --> 02:22.851
chasing down Joey.

02:22.919 --> 02:27.523
It was one of them
police sedans, I think.

02:27.590 --> 02:29.068
They had him trapped against
a wall and then two cops

02:29.092 --> 02:31.460
hopped out and threw him to the ground.

02:31.528 --> 02:36.098
He was laying there screaming,
"Someone call my moms!

02:36.166 --> 02:39.334
Someone call my moms!"

02:39.402 --> 02:41.003
Over and over.

02:41.071 --> 02:43.305
I mean, at first, he sounded angry,

02:43.373 --> 02:47.309
but... by the end
he sounded like he was crying.

02:47.377 --> 02:49.712
Then what happened?

02:49.779 --> 02:54.349
An older white man
in, like, black military gear

02:54.417 --> 02:57.186
got out of the car with the handcuffs.

02:57.253 --> 02:59.221
Joey was still screaming out
for his moms

02:59.289 --> 03:01.290
and wouldn't let them cuff him.

03:03.860 --> 03:05.594
Then the old man shot him.

03:07.063 --> 03:09.965
Everything went quiet.

03:10.033 --> 03:11.834
What happened after that?

03:11.901 --> 03:13.669
I don't know.

03:13.737 --> 03:15.404
I got out of there as fast as I could.

03:15.472 --> 03:17.106
Did they see you?

03:17.173 --> 03:18.941
I didn't think so.

03:19.008 --> 03:22.277
But they tried to run me over
a couple weeks after that,

03:22.345 --> 03:24.613
either 'cause they knew what I seen

03:24.681 --> 03:27.149
or either 'cause they seen me
talking to you.

03:27.217 --> 03:29.084
We've been hiding him out

03:29.152 --> 03:30.953
because we didn't know what else to do.

03:31.020 --> 03:32.821
In Gate Station,
you don't go to the cops

03:32.889 --> 03:34.656
to snitch on the cops.

03:36.593 --> 03:39.328
Did you at least get
a good look at them?

03:39.395 --> 03:41.463
Not the cops.

03:41.531 --> 03:42.998
Just the old man.

03:43.066 --> 03:45.066
If you saw this man again,
would you recognize him?

03:48.905 --> 03:51.106
Yeah.

04:09.659 --> 04:10.993
This is no longer speculation.

04:11.060 --> 04:12.771
The Sheriff's Department
murdered Joey Campbell

04:12.795 --> 04:13.847
and they're trying to cover it up.

04:13.871 --> 04:15.614
We need to call the bosses
and open up the case.

04:15.638 --> 04:17.108
- Not yet.
- What the hell are you talking about?

04:17.132 --> 04:19.601
If we go after this, we're not targeting

04:19.668 --> 04:21.769
a lone deputy who killed a white kid.

04:21.838 --> 04:24.139
We're taking on an entire
sheriff's department.

04:24.207 --> 04:26.842
In this town, that's like trying
to topple a small government.

04:26.910 --> 04:30.179
We have to check the credibility
of our witness.

04:30.246 --> 04:32.181
We need to be patient and keep digging.

04:32.248 --> 04:34.783
I'm done being patient.

04:40.523 --> 04:42.724
We apologize for
contacting you so late, sir.

04:42.817 --> 04:45.802
I'm sure it's urgent, so let's hear it.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.349
We have a 17-year-old boy

04:47.374 --> 04:48.339
who's come forward to say

04:48.364 --> 04:50.199
he's witnessed the murder
of Joey Campbell.

04:50.266 --> 04:51.433
I'm aware of the case.

04:51.501 --> 04:52.578
How long ago was the young man killed?

04:52.602 --> 04:54.369
Six weeks ago.

04:54.437 --> 04:56.197
And your witness suddenly found
a conscience?

04:56.239 --> 04:57.539
He felt his life was in danger.

04:57.607 --> 05:00.309
So why come forward now?

05:00.376 --> 05:02.878
His uncle brought me to him to talk.

05:02.946 --> 05:04.780
They decided it was the right time.

05:04.848 --> 05:06.048
What did he say?

05:06.115 --> 05:07.925
Two officers from the
sheriff's department

05:08.019 --> 05:09.751
held down Joey Campbell
while an older man,

05:09.819 --> 05:12.339
possibly a commander of some sort,

05:12.409 --> 05:13.722
walks over and shoots him.

05:13.790 --> 05:16.566
Now, the witness didn't see
the two officers' faces,

05:16.591 --> 05:18.755
but he's confident he'd
recognize the older man.

05:18.873 --> 05:20.796
What can you tell me about your witness?

05:20.864 --> 05:22.965
He's never been in any trouble
with the law.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.299
Is he in school?

05:24.367 --> 05:26.294
He dropped out,
but he plans on returning.

05:26.319 --> 05:27.720
African-American?

05:27.915 --> 05:29.137
Yes, sir.

05:29.205 --> 05:31.773
In a racially divided town,

05:32.472 --> 05:33.993
an African-American dropout

05:34.034 --> 05:37.644
claims cops who he can't even
identify killed a kid?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.433
Found anyone to corroborate his story?

05:39.480 --> 05:41.617
No, sir, but we find
our witness highly credible.

05:41.684 --> 05:44.152
- I'll keep it on my radar.
- On your radar, sir?

05:44.220 --> 05:46.021
That's it?

05:47.723 --> 05:50.238
Yes, Mr. Terry, that's it.

05:50.927 --> 05:53.287
And I'm beginning to wonder
if you're having difficulties

05:53.312 --> 05:55.364
staying focused on the case
you've been assigned to.

05:55.431 --> 05:57.699
We are making progress
on the Jesse Carr case, sir.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.701
We've been working
without the benefit of video

05:59.769 --> 06:01.313
or witnesses,
so we've been investigating

06:01.337 --> 06:02.704
a number of possible scenarios.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.708
- Update me by week's end.
- Yes, sir. Um, in the meantime,

06:06.776 --> 06:09.778
we'd like to get this potential witness
into protective custody.

06:09.846 --> 06:11.713
His concern for his safety
seems genuine.

06:11.781 --> 06:13.482
I'll take that under advisement.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.956
- What the hell?
- Shh! Shh!

06:56.993 --> 06:58.293
- Stay there.
- Boys?

06:58.859 --> 07:01.203
- Jay!
- Kerry, stay right there!

07:12.842 --> 07:14.142
Stay here.

07:53.745 --> 07:55.745
We're going to have
a squad car parked outside

07:55.770 --> 07:57.816
till this calms the hell down.

07:58.309 --> 08:01.035
Thank you, sir,
but I don't need all that.

08:01.145 --> 08:02.712
I'm not asking.

08:02.844 --> 08:04.712
We take care of our own.

08:04.763 --> 08:07.131
Sure doesn't feel like that, sir.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.421
Excuse me?

08:12.920 --> 08:14.855
I'm on desk duty.

08:15.156 --> 08:17.157
The union dropped me.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.893
And if the person
who did this was outside

08:19.961 --> 08:22.819
when I came out with my gun,
I would have fired,

08:23.194 --> 08:25.249
just like anyone else on the force.

08:25.827 --> 08:28.128
But what would have happened
to me then?

08:29.784 --> 08:31.024
Did the neighbors see anything?

08:31.565 --> 08:32.905
No, sir.

08:32.974 --> 08:34.174
Not a thing.

08:47.989 --> 08:49.466
Why don't we just get it out of the way?

08:49.490 --> 08:52.082
- What?
- The "I told you so."

08:52.512 --> 08:54.695
I told you he wouldn't open
an investigation

08:54.762 --> 08:57.297
based on a kid's word
against an entire department.

08:57.365 --> 09:00.200
We should have built a stronger case
before going to the boss.

09:00.268 --> 09:02.736
- I led with my heart, my bad.
- You led with your ego.

09:02.804 --> 09:04.037
You finished?

09:04.105 --> 09:06.831
If you can't listen to the one person
who has your back in all this...

09:06.855 --> 09:08.501
- I got it.
- Do you?

09:08.560 --> 09:10.827
Because I need you to have my back, too.

09:15.567 --> 09:17.034
So what now?

09:17.101 --> 09:18.769
The frat kids told you

09:18.836 --> 09:21.238
Jesse was going to the hood
to buy barbecue.

09:21.306 --> 09:24.541
But he still had marijuana
in his glove compartment.

09:24.609 --> 09:27.210
I'm gonna track down
the school's weed connection.

09:27.278 --> 09:29.467
You need to request
the department's arrest records

09:29.492 --> 09:30.998
for the last three months.

09:31.023 --> 09:32.983
- What exactly are we looking for?
- I don't know.

09:33.429 --> 09:35.265
But we'll know when we see it.

09:36.656 --> 09:38.522
This isn't about Jesse and Joey anymore.

09:38.590 --> 09:40.724
This is about the entire
sheriff's department.

09:51.336 --> 09:52.869
That was smooth.

09:52.937 --> 09:54.705
You must be Brady.

09:54.772 --> 09:56.306
Who wants to know?

10:00.612 --> 10:01.912
Get up.

10:07.018 --> 10:08.885
Word is if you want weed on campus,

10:08.953 --> 10:10.721
you're the man to see.

10:10.788 --> 10:12.556
But I'm not interested in busting you.

10:12.624 --> 10:14.791
- Ask me why not.
- Why not?

10:14.859 --> 10:16.459
Because I want to know about Jesse Carr.

10:16.494 --> 10:18.795
- What about him?
- The weed that was on him

10:18.863 --> 10:20.663
the day he was killed...
did it come from you?

10:20.698 --> 10:21.938
Jesse wasn't into getting high.

10:21.966 --> 10:23.300
How do you know?

10:23.368 --> 10:24.979
I kind of make it my business
to know these things.

10:25.003 --> 10:26.436
Is there someone in the hood

10:26.504 --> 10:28.939
who might be a connect
for Jesse or his frat brothers?

10:29.007 --> 10:30.217
If they wanted weed, why would they go

10:30.241 --> 10:31.481
all the way to the hood for it?

10:31.509 --> 10:34.745
My stuff's as good as anyone's.

10:34.812 --> 10:36.346
Give me a 20.

10:52.697 --> 10:54.131
Mr. Terry.

10:54.198 --> 10:55.709
I need records for all the arrests made

10:55.733 --> 10:57.934
in this department in the last 90 days.

10:58.002 --> 11:00.314
I don't want digitized copies;
I want the original hard copies.

11:00.338 --> 11:01.805
What is this, a fishing expedition?

11:01.873 --> 11:04.823
It's a government investigation.
I'm encouraging you to cooperate.

11:05.558 --> 11:08.545
- It'll take a few days to assemble.
- I'll give you an hour.

11:08.613 --> 11:12.115
Young man, you need to learn
how to talk to people.

11:14.686 --> 11:16.753
Sounds like you're saying
I need to know my place.

11:18.356 --> 11:20.673
You may not have respect for
the citizens of this community.

11:20.697 --> 11:22.592
Like it or not, you will respect me.

11:26.731 --> 11:28.098
Your mother and I,

11:28.166 --> 11:30.500
we're taking a loan against the house.

11:30.568 --> 11:32.379
We're gonna have enough
to cover your legal fees.

11:32.403 --> 11:34.838
Dad, no, no.

11:34.906 --> 11:36.840
Y-You paid off your house years ago.

11:36.908 --> 11:39.019
No, I'd rather take my chances
with a public defender.

11:39.043 --> 11:41.278
You're not going down
for that white boy,

11:41.345 --> 11:42.832
just like those good ol' boys
don't go down

11:42.856 --> 11:44.783
when they killed one of ours.

11:47.518 --> 11:49.666
You say that like you think
I murdered him, Pop.

11:51.155 --> 11:53.190
I didn't mean it like that.

11:53.257 --> 11:54.858
You know better.

11:54.926 --> 11:57.661
I-I got to go back inside.

11:57.729 --> 11:58.929
Love you.

12:00.164 --> 12:01.364
Love you, boy.

12:14.545 --> 12:16.546
Mr. Terry.

12:16.614 --> 12:19.783
If you have a few minutes,
I'd like to show you something.

12:25.490 --> 12:28.091
Where are you going?

12:28.159 --> 12:30.560
This is about Joey!

12:47.011 --> 12:48.278
Come take a look.

13:02.794 --> 13:05.362
License and registration.

13:05.429 --> 13:06.930
Yeah, I got it.

13:06.998 --> 13:08.365
What'd I do?

13:08.432 --> 13:10.767
You weren't wearing your seat belt.

13:10.835 --> 13:12.969
And you can see that
from all the way back there?

13:13.037 --> 13:14.477
You need to step out of the vehicle.

13:14.539 --> 13:15.705
All of you.

13:23.548 --> 13:24.925
The three of you need to turn around

13:24.949 --> 13:27.450
and put your hands behind your head.

13:27.518 --> 13:29.553
Do it now.

13:34.192 --> 13:36.326
Pat them down.

13:36.394 --> 13:38.261
What?

13:38.329 --> 13:39.996
I don't have time to call for backup.

13:50.842 --> 13:52.075
Easy.

14:04.422 --> 14:05.522
Get your hands off me.

14:07.425 --> 14:08.669
I said don't touch me, all right?

14:08.693 --> 14:10.093
Hey, that's my kid!

14:10.161 --> 14:12.429
Well, your dumb-ass kid should
get some common sense.

14:12.496 --> 14:13.697
Get up.

14:19.937 --> 14:20.937
Finish.

14:33.317 --> 14:35.552
Turn around.

14:37.121 --> 14:39.122
Watch them for me.

14:43.628 --> 14:45.495
You have a permit for this firearm?

14:45.563 --> 14:47.130
Envelope in the glove box.

14:53.871 --> 14:55.605
Look all right to you?

14:58.342 --> 14:59.509
Yeah.

15:18.863 --> 15:21.131
Keep that seatbelt on.

15:21.198 --> 15:22.465
Have a good day.

15:24.936 --> 15:26.736
Complete waste of time.

15:31.876 --> 15:33.476
What the hell is your problem?

15:33.544 --> 15:34.778
This some sort of game to you?

15:36.480 --> 15:38.581
You're the ones with the games,
aren't you?

15:38.649 --> 15:40.294
You come here acting like
you know everything

15:40.318 --> 15:41.484
about this town, about us?

15:41.552 --> 15:43.112
Well, maybe I know more than you think.

15:43.154 --> 15:45.555
That feeling you just felt...

15:45.623 --> 15:50.393
that scared, angry tightness
in the chest...

15:50.461 --> 15:53.797
that's what my deputies feel
every day in the Houses.

15:53.864 --> 15:56.333
They're policing people who hate them.

15:56.400 --> 16:00.003
Given the chance, some of those
people might hurt them.

16:00.071 --> 16:02.739
Add that to the list of things you know.

16:02.807 --> 16:04.251
Maybe people in the Houses wouldn't hate

16:04.275 --> 16:05.719
your deputies so much
if they weren't known

16:05.743 --> 16:08.178
for killing innocent people.

16:08.245 --> 16:10.347
Is that your personal
or professional opinion?

16:11.682 --> 16:15.051
Be careful before making
accusations you can't back up.

16:15.119 --> 16:18.555
That your personal
or professional advice?

16:33.794 --> 16:36.129
Welcome to Lorton Middle School,

16:36.197 --> 16:40.400
located in the plush suburbs
of Gate Station, North Carolina.

16:40.468 --> 16:42.135
I'm Shirlane Woods,

16:42.203 --> 16:44.971
and I am honored to moderate
this town hall meeting

16:45.039 --> 16:49.450
where we will discuss the new
Eamons Education Initiative.

16:49.510 --> 16:52.779
Please join me in welcoming
Governor Patricia Eamons.

16:57.852 --> 16:59.019
Thank you!

16:59.086 --> 17:00.787
Good evening.

17:00.855 --> 17:02.055
Thank you so much.

17:10.798 --> 17:12.065
You all right?

17:12.133 --> 17:13.133
Kind of nervous.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.099
You'll be fine.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.603
Just speak your truth, okay?

17:16.670 --> 17:18.070
Governor, we'd love for you

17:18.138 --> 17:20.272
to tell us more about your initiative.

17:20.340 --> 17:24.676
Schools like West Gate Middle School
are closing down,

17:24.994 --> 17:27.914
because they've lost
their accreditation.

17:27.982 --> 17:32.252
And the people who are left to suffer
are the children of that community.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.753
Therefore, under my initiative,

17:33.821 --> 17:36.623
we will spend $3 million

17:36.690 --> 17:39.292
not only to renovate

17:39.360 --> 17:42.128
and train qualified educators
at West Gate,

17:42.196 --> 17:44.464
but at four other schools
in the state as well.

17:44.532 --> 17:46.332
I want to thank Pastor Janae Jones

17:46.400 --> 17:49.202
for helping bring this crisis
to my attention,

17:49.270 --> 17:52.605
along with the young man you'll
be hearing from a little later.

17:52.673 --> 17:54.541
So while we're creating
a new and improved.

17:54.608 --> 17:56.676
West Gate Middle School,
students who attended

17:56.744 --> 17:58.952
that school will be given a choice.

17:59.054 --> 18:03.149
Currently, they've been told to go to
Jackson Junior High, 15 miles away.

18:03.217 --> 18:05.452
This will remain an option.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.087
However, former West Gate students

18:07.154 --> 18:10.090
will also be given the choice
to attend Lorton.

18:11.225 --> 18:13.393
So you're talking

18:13.461 --> 18:16.372
about bussing kids from
the Houses to this school?

18:16.451 --> 18:17.723
I'm talking about giving children

18:17.747 --> 18:20.591
an opportunity to learn
in an environment

18:20.669 --> 18:22.602
without overcrowded classrooms.

18:22.670 --> 18:24.637
This is an opportunity to bring

18:24.705 --> 18:26.806
divided communities together.

18:26.874 --> 18:28.942
West Gate students and Lorton students

18:29.009 --> 18:31.778
will benefit from this
beyond what we can measure.

18:31.846 --> 18:34.681
Certainly the taxpayers will be
able to measure the costs.

18:34.748 --> 18:36.516
Taxpayers won't pay a cent.

18:36.584 --> 18:37.984
My initiative is privately funded.

18:38.052 --> 18:39.486
From whom?

18:39.553 --> 18:41.821
Arlen Cox and The Cox Group Financial.

18:48.696 --> 18:50.363
Paid for by Penn Moder,

18:50.431 --> 18:52.198
running for governor of North Carolina.

18:52.266 --> 18:54.000
The safety of our children

18:54.068 --> 18:55.969
is of the utmost importance.

18:56.036 --> 18:59.472
Once elected governor, I'll continue

18:59.540 --> 19:01.708
to work tirelessly to develop
legislation

19:01.775 --> 19:03.910
like the Jess Carr "Call First" bill.

19:08.649 --> 19:11.317
I just got back from Cory's motel.

19:11.385 --> 19:13.286
His uncle's restless.

19:13.354 --> 19:14.921
Cory's still scared.

19:14.989 --> 19:17.525
I sent in another request
for protective custody.

19:17.589 --> 19:19.268
I'll let you know.

19:19.727 --> 19:21.227
How'd it go with the college kingpin?

19:21.295 --> 19:23.713
He swears Jesse's weed wasn't from him.

19:23.783 --> 19:25.947
I put his stash in the lab
to get checked out.

19:26.025 --> 19:27.924
So what are we doing here?

19:28.142 --> 19:30.347
I want to break down what happened
the day Jesse was killed.

19:30.371 --> 19:32.071
Get inside their heads.

19:32.295 --> 19:33.495
You're Jesse.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.010
All right.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.916
Where's your head at?

19:42.983 --> 19:45.418
Well, a black RA beats me up.

19:45.486 --> 19:49.155
My frat gives me hell
and they send me to the hood

19:49.223 --> 19:53.993
for barbecue or weed or whatever,
and I'm pissed.

19:54.061 --> 19:56.039
- And you had a drink or two.
- Right, so the last thing I need

19:56.063 --> 19:57.830
is for some black cop to pull me over.

19:57.898 --> 19:59.832
I'm the only brother in the department.

19:59.900 --> 20:02.202
I see a white kid in the neighborhood.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.636
Doesn't seem right.

20:03.704 --> 20:06.039
I pull you over, ask for your license.

20:06.106 --> 20:07.874
According to Beck, I don't comply.

20:07.942 --> 20:10.109
Why not? Why wouldn't you comply?

20:10.247 --> 20:11.581
Because I'm too drunk.

20:11.651 --> 20:14.113
No, if you were that drunk
I would have known it.

20:14.181 --> 20:15.882
- It would have been on my report.
- Okay.

20:15.950 --> 20:17.784
Okay, because I know it's a bogus stop.

20:17.851 --> 20:19.385
Racial profiling.

20:19.453 --> 20:21.688
So I call you out on it,
refuse to give you my license.

20:21.755 --> 20:23.122
I tell you to get out of the car.

20:28.128 --> 20:30.063
Then something happens and you shoot me.

20:30.130 --> 20:32.632
Question is do you believe
you did the right thing,

20:32.700 --> 20:35.668
or are you thinking
of some sort of cover-up?

20:35.736 --> 20:37.070
Where's your head?

20:39.039 --> 20:42.809
I'm hoping that the life I took
isn't the life of somebody good,

20:42.876 --> 20:46.713
with a future or family or friends.

20:46.780 --> 20:49.082
I'm asking myself

20:49.149 --> 20:52.385
what the hell I could've done
differently.

20:54.088 --> 20:56.256
Then Breeland shows up, right?

20:56.323 --> 20:58.222
Finds weed in the glove compartment.

20:58.261 --> 21:01.988
Right, um, Breeland was the first
on the scene when Jesse was killed.

21:02.097 --> 21:03.863
I found this in the police report.

21:08.235 --> 21:10.336
"Calvert Breeland,
the first on the scene

21:10.404 --> 21:12.438
to report the murder of Joey Campbell."

21:12.506 --> 21:13.706
- Coincidence?
- Maybe not.

21:13.774 --> 21:16.442
Maybe he's the key to us
getting Joey's case opened.

21:16.510 --> 21:18.970
That guy has a wall up.
He won't tell us anything.

21:19.048 --> 21:22.048
His wall will come down.
We just have to get him to want to talk.

21:23.951 --> 21:28.048
No offense to those kids
who had their school shut down.

21:28.118 --> 21:31.269
As I heard it, one of the reasons
it lost its accreditation

21:31.324 --> 21:33.826
was because of rampant violence.

21:33.894 --> 21:35.295
This is the neighborhood

21:35.362 --> 21:38.498
where that drug dealer everyone
is protesting about was killed.

21:40.401 --> 21:41.968
West Gate is being shut down

21:42.036 --> 21:44.037
because the building
did not adhere to safety codes

21:44.104 --> 21:45.872
and students received low test scores.

21:45.939 --> 21:48.641
A school with 35 to 40 students
in a classroom

21:48.709 --> 21:51.077
with one teacher
will always underperform.

21:51.145 --> 21:54.147
And you can't generalize
African-American students

21:54.214 --> 21:56.582
as a bunch of gangsters
coming to our town.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.484
That's ignorant and racist.

21:59.747 --> 22:01.307
The fact that someone would demonize us

22:01.339 --> 22:02.955
for telling the truth is racist.

22:03.023 --> 22:06.459
We don't care what color they are.
If those kids come to our community,

22:06.527 --> 22:09.316
we're gonna have to install
metal detectors in our school.

22:09.387 --> 22:11.598
Is that the environment we
want our kids to learn in?

22:11.668 --> 22:14.267
Ma'am, you won't need a metal detector;
You'll need an open mind.

22:14.335 --> 22:16.346
- With all due respect...
- No, no, hold on a second.

22:16.370 --> 22:17.603
I'm a parent, too.

22:17.671 --> 22:19.272
I want what's best for my daughter,

22:19.340 --> 22:21.174
same as you want what's best
for your child.

22:21.241 --> 22:24.344
That's the same thing
the West Gate parents want.

22:24.411 --> 22:27.113
Governor, I will gladly
go along with your plan

22:27.181 --> 22:28.981
to bring kids in from the Houses

22:29.049 --> 22:31.562
if you're willing to send
your own teenage daughter

22:31.617 --> 22:33.187
to a school near the Houses.

22:33.257 --> 22:35.988
Show us how open-minded you are.

22:39.850 --> 22:42.844
Okay, all right.

22:46.567 --> 22:50.670
Okay, all right, please quiet down.

22:50.738 --> 22:53.339
Quiet down, please. Okay.

22:55.376 --> 22:57.143
Just right over here, ma'am.

22:57.211 --> 22:58.644
Can I get you anything?

22:58.712 --> 23:00.146
No, I'm fine, thank you.

23:08.155 --> 23:09.566
Three months ago, you filed a complaint

23:09.590 --> 23:11.524
against Lieutenant Breeland.

23:11.592 --> 23:13.826
I'm one of the few people
in the neighborhood

23:13.894 --> 23:15.495
not scared of that man.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.407
Your complaint said
that he killed your husband.

23:17.431 --> 23:19.432
Every Sunday

23:19.500 --> 23:23.169
when me and my husband
were driving to church,

23:23.237 --> 23:25.671
Breeland would pull us over
for no reason,

23:25.739 --> 23:29.442
always looking for something.

23:29.510 --> 23:31.998
This went on for about two months.

23:32.076 --> 23:36.010
Then my husband told him
enough was enough.

23:38.285 --> 23:40.720
Breeland arrested him
and threw him in jail

23:40.788 --> 23:42.488
for being non-compliant

23:42.556 --> 23:44.991
and threatening an officer.

23:45.058 --> 23:47.160
He got out a few hours later,

23:47.227 --> 23:52.999
but a month after that, my husband died.

23:54.768 --> 23:59.211
You know how stressful that is,

23:59.297 --> 24:01.484
being harassed all your life?

24:03.310 --> 24:08.614
A 72-year-old black man
still dealing with that crap?

24:08.682 --> 24:11.484
Whatever happened with the complaint?

24:11.552 --> 24:13.986
Not a damn thing.

24:20.093 --> 24:21.761
I'm at the kid's motel.

25:10.811 --> 25:12.238
They're safe.

25:18.165 --> 25:19.602
You know, there's a pretty cool invention

25:19.626 --> 25:20.926
you might have heard about.

25:20.994 --> 25:22.126
It's called e-mail.

25:22.195 --> 25:23.796
You should check it out sometime.

25:23.864 --> 25:27.033
There's another invention
called "kiss my ass."

25:28.402 --> 25:29.936
Yeah, I think I heard of that one.

25:30.003 --> 25:32.171
I was sending a letter to my daughter.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.377
Handwritten notes are more personal.

25:34.441 --> 25:36.275
I'll give you that.

25:47.521 --> 25:49.455
We need a few minutes of your time.

25:49.523 --> 25:51.757
I'm about to go on patrol.

25:51.825 --> 25:53.025
That'll have to wait.

26:00.868 --> 26:03.536
How would you describe
your relationship with Breeland?

26:03.604 --> 26:05.204
He's my commanding officer.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.974
He's had three complaints filed
over the last year.

26:08.041 --> 26:10.810
What exactly do you want to know?

26:10.878 --> 26:13.133
We want to know if you think he's dirty.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.211
No. I don't.

26:18.203 --> 26:23.055
But next time you want to talk,
then you call my union rep.

26:35.936 --> 26:37.737
I see your poll numbers are up

26:37.804 --> 26:40.940
among African-Americans
and college-educated whites.

26:41.008 --> 26:44.543
But your white blue-collar base

26:44.611 --> 26:46.794
seems to be favoring
Penn Moder, your opponent.

26:46.819 --> 26:50.216
I like to approach the polls
with a healthy dose of cynicism.

26:50.284 --> 26:54.220
You didn't do yourself any favors
with that town hall debacle,

26:54.288 --> 26:57.987
but the boost we're gonna
give this economy

26:58.057 --> 27:00.143
is gonna silence all of your critics.

27:00.198 --> 27:01.198
Craig?

27:01.228 --> 27:02.695
As agreed to,

27:02.763 --> 27:04.463
regarding the Cox
Correctional Institution,

27:04.531 --> 27:07.667
the Cox Group Financial
will employ contractors,

27:07.734 --> 27:09.402
timber workers, and paper suppliers

27:09.469 --> 27:11.677
from the state of North Carolina only.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.973
The state will also get 50% of revenues

27:14.041 --> 27:15.541
from prisoner phone cards.

27:15.609 --> 27:18.044
In addition, the Cox Group
Financial will hire

27:18.111 --> 27:19.812
400 full-time employees.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.347
Sounds good.

27:21.415 --> 27:23.149
I would like to make one adjustment.

27:23.216 --> 27:27.386
Instead of the 85%
prisoner occupancy number

27:27.454 --> 27:30.556
that we have been discussing previously,

27:30.624 --> 27:36.729
I'd like the state to entertain
the notion of an 88% figure.

27:36.797 --> 27:39.198
Now, I would be agreeing
to increased arrests,

27:39.266 --> 27:40.266
longer sentences,

27:40.300 --> 27:43.269
$30,000 per inmate?

27:43.337 --> 27:45.871
But you would be able
to comfortably support

27:45.939 --> 27:47.440
the entire Eamons Education...

27:47.507 --> 27:49.742
Wait, wait, wait, your attorney
said we had a deal.

27:49.810 --> 27:51.043
You said we had a deal.

27:51.111 --> 27:53.379
We almost have a deal, Governor.

27:53.447 --> 27:55.548
We're at an impasse here.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.456
I remember when your word
meant something, Arlen.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.828
I am a man of my word,

28:08.895 --> 28:12.732
and I gave you my word that
I would help you to the utmost

28:12.799 --> 28:15.134
in your re-election bid.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.586
So who is it this time?

28:33.653 --> 28:35.521
Some little old lady say

28:35.589 --> 28:37.490
I didn't get her cat out of a tree?

28:37.557 --> 28:40.945
Let's just cut to the chase, Lieutenant.
Let's go to the interview room.

28:41.007 --> 28:42.194
I told you already,

28:42.262 --> 28:44.730
I ain't sitting in the box
like a criminal for no one.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.067
Here, then.

28:51.638 --> 28:53.238
You're trying to build a case around me.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.707
Why?

28:54.775 --> 28:56.275
We're just looking into some things.

28:56.343 --> 28:57.576
Got some questions to ask.

28:57.644 --> 28:59.045
Fire away.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.048
You were first on the scene
when Jesse was killed.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.893
Well, technically, Beck
was first on the scene.

29:03.917 --> 29:06.029
You were also first on the scene
when Joey Campbell was killed.

29:06.053 --> 29:08.731
How do you always find yourself
at the right place at the right time?

29:08.755 --> 29:10.823
It's called competent law enforcement.

29:10.891 --> 29:12.458
Read some complaints on you.

29:12.526 --> 29:13.993
Some would call what you do

29:14.061 --> 29:15.361
harassment and abuse of power.

29:15.429 --> 29:16.796
Take the good with the bad.

29:16.863 --> 29:19.231
Is that what you teach
your deputies, Coach?

29:19.299 --> 29:21.367
Beck learned racial profiling from you.

29:21.435 --> 29:22.968
News flash:

29:23.036 --> 29:27.643
Profiling works on white people
and on black people.

29:28.742 --> 29:30.843
You heard some complaints against me

29:30.911 --> 29:33.179
and you want to believe that
you have me all figured out.

29:33.246 --> 29:35.514
You have no idea
how many mothers and fathers

29:35.582 --> 29:37.716
come to me to thank me
for keeping their kids in line.

29:37.784 --> 29:39.899
You're actually looking at me
with a straight face

29:39.961 --> 29:42.305
saying you're one of the good guys?

29:43.490 --> 29:46.258
I had a screwed up relationship
with my daddy.

29:46.938 --> 29:49.728
Hated him when I was a kid.

29:49.796 --> 29:53.432
Calls me a few years ago,
tells me he's got the cancer

29:53.500 --> 29:56.702
and he's scared
to go through it all alone.

29:56.770 --> 29:59.338
My wife begs me to be nice,

29:59.406 --> 30:01.740
so I figured, "What the hell?"

30:01.808 --> 30:03.776
So I go through it all with him,

30:03.844 --> 30:05.911
the chemo and the radiation bull.

30:05.979 --> 30:10.082
A few months later, he dies.

30:10.150 --> 30:13.052
For the way he treated my mother,

30:13.120 --> 30:15.721
the way he left her to raise us,

30:15.789 --> 30:17.723
I'd always thought of him as a bad guy.

30:17.791 --> 30:20.359
Then I get to the funeral
and all these people

30:20.427 --> 30:21.794
come up to me and they tell me

30:21.862 --> 30:24.396
he's the greatest guy in the world.

30:24.464 --> 30:27.933
Tell me stories
about how he's helped them,

30:28.001 --> 30:30.269
that he was the only one that was there

30:30.337 --> 30:33.639
when no one else was.

30:33.707 --> 30:37.543
So, you see, this notion
of good guys and bad guys

30:38.007 --> 30:40.483
doesn't exist for me anymore.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.114
Perfect cop,

30:42.182 --> 30:45.885
perfect citizens to police...
they don't exist, either.

30:47.787 --> 30:50.222
We don't want perfect.
We want officers to uphold the law.

30:53.860 --> 30:55.961
You see, it don't look that way to me.

30:56.029 --> 30:57.730
One of you looks like

30:57.797 --> 30:59.383
you're trying to make a name
for yourself

30:59.407 --> 31:00.716
and the other one looks like
you're trying

31:00.740 --> 31:02.701
to rid yourself of your demons.

31:02.769 --> 31:04.236
You two wanna be good guys?

31:04.959 --> 31:06.872
You should go back to D.C.,

31:07.420 --> 31:09.375
chase down some crooked politicians,

31:09.442 --> 31:12.178
and let us go about
the business of policing

31:12.245 --> 31:15.114
the people of Gate Station.

31:15.182 --> 31:18.117
You don't belong here,
and you never will.

31:20.353 --> 31:21.353
Hey, guys!

31:31.455 --> 31:33.853
Pastor Janae is calling again.

31:33.955 --> 31:35.255
Is it about Arlen?

31:35.323 --> 31:37.191
She's upset about his name

31:37.258 --> 31:39.760
being involved
with the Education Initiative.

31:39.828 --> 31:41.862
She feels it's a conflict of interest.

31:41.930 --> 31:43.240
Without his money, it doesn't happen.

31:43.264 --> 31:46.600
Is there any other way
to make the guarantee?

31:46.668 --> 31:48.602
Yeah, pull from our
overcrowded state jails

31:48.670 --> 31:51.167
instead of granting early releases.

31:52.140 --> 31:53.574
What's your opinion?

31:56.511 --> 31:59.780
I think you believe that better schools

31:59.848 --> 32:02.983
will reduce the need for more prisons.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.518
And I think you're right.

32:07.689 --> 32:09.890
Get Arlen Cox on the phone for me.

32:12.894 --> 32:14.394
Lorton's got all your school records.

32:14.462 --> 32:15.761
When you get there tomorrow,

32:15.831 --> 32:17.241
your guidance counselor will
give you your class schedule.

32:17.265 --> 32:19.243
You're not hearing me, Mom:
I don't want to go to that school!

32:19.267 --> 32:20.634
It ain't open for discussion.

32:20.702 --> 32:22.569
How's it not open for discussion?

32:22.637 --> 32:24.171
You want me to speak my truth, right?

32:24.239 --> 32:25.739
Well, I'm speaking it.

32:25.807 --> 32:27.407
I'm not going to that white school.

32:27.475 --> 32:29.510
Even if you put me on that bus,

32:29.577 --> 32:31.355
I'm not going to that school
where everybody hates us.

32:31.379 --> 32:33.046
You ain't got to worry
about them people.

32:33.114 --> 32:34.648
Maybe you don't, but I do!

32:34.716 --> 32:36.683
There won't be 35 kids to a classroom,

32:36.751 --> 32:38.399
everybody gonna get
their own computers...

32:38.469 --> 32:41.054
- I don't care about all that!
- Start caring!

32:41.122 --> 32:42.562
This school gonna give you a chance.

32:42.624 --> 32:44.825
A chance at what?
Not making any friends?

32:44.893 --> 32:46.613
A chance at not ending up
like your brother!

32:49.097 --> 32:53.066
I lost Joey. I can't lose you, too.

32:53.134 --> 32:54.368
I can't.

32:55.045 --> 32:57.131
I can't, Shawn, please.

33:00.304 --> 33:04.441
Please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:05.161 --> 33:06.620
Please...

33:08.883 --> 33:11.206
I got you. I got you.

33:16.191 --> 33:18.225
I saw the town hall meeting online.

33:18.293 --> 33:19.493
Yeah? What'd you think?

33:19.561 --> 33:21.028
Bad move politically, Mom,

33:21.095 --> 33:22.462
but that's what made it so cool.

33:22.530 --> 33:24.331
Thank you, I think.

33:24.399 --> 33:25.899
But I do think someone had a point.

33:25.967 --> 33:27.401
Who?

33:27.468 --> 33:29.262
The lady that said you should
be open-minded enough

33:29.286 --> 33:30.781
to let me go to a school by the Houses.

33:30.805 --> 33:32.206
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

33:32.273 --> 33:34.074
- Why not?
- For one, it's not safe.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.742
You're such a hypocrite.

33:35.810 --> 33:38.289
I'm not saying the people are dangerous;
I'm saying the neighborhood...

33:38.313 --> 33:39.557
That neighborhood is
made up of people...

33:39.581 --> 33:40.747
a certain kind of people.

33:40.815 --> 33:42.193
What are you implying now,
that I'm racist?

33:42.217 --> 33:43.584
Liberals can be racist, too, Mom.

33:43.651 --> 33:45.819
This is not about color, Katie.

33:45.887 --> 33:48.088
Your dad and I want to give you
the best education

33:48.156 --> 33:49.857
that we can provide.

33:49.924 --> 33:51.535
If I think kids like Shawn
should have better schooling,

33:51.559 --> 33:53.037
why would I send my own daughter there?

33:53.061 --> 33:55.729
Because you can't keep asking people
to be impatient for change

33:55.797 --> 33:57.431
while your own daughter
conveniently goes

33:57.498 --> 33:59.150
to a $30,000 a year prep school.

33:59.175 --> 34:01.301
How about we conveniently
change the subject?

35:13.375 --> 35:14.375
Yo.

35:25.286 --> 35:27.321
- Thanks.
- Dale Johnson.

35:27.388 --> 35:28.388
Shawn Campbell.

35:28.456 --> 35:30.434
- Will you help me pass some of these out?
- All right.

35:30.458 --> 35:32.526
Who wants some Bulldog shirts?

35:32.593 --> 35:34.313
Got more Bulldog shirts
if anyone wants one.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.133
Whatever the hell is going on,

35:40.201 --> 35:43.203
Breeland is in the middle of it,
or he knows who is.

35:43.271 --> 35:45.472
Well, he hasn't given us much to go on.

35:45.540 --> 35:47.641
We're no closer to getting
a case open on Joey.

35:49.448 --> 35:50.758
Come on.

35:51.212 --> 35:52.412
Where are we going?

35:52.690 --> 35:54.273
To follow the weed.

35:59.821 --> 36:02.789
There are over 600 strains
of marijuana in the state.

36:04.592 --> 36:06.632
The weed that was found
in Jesse's glove compartment

36:06.694 --> 36:08.628
does not match the stash
from the college dealer.

36:08.696 --> 36:10.530
But it's the same strain of marijuana

36:10.598 --> 36:12.132
found on Joey Campbell.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.510
Even though Jesse was killed
four miles away

36:13.534 --> 36:14.968
from Joey's neighborhood.

36:15.036 --> 36:18.308
Even though they sell a totally
different strain of weed over there.

36:18.428 --> 36:20.886
- What are you saying?
- I don't know.

36:22.377 --> 36:23.810
Jesse and Joey knew each other,

36:23.878 --> 36:26.313
or they bought weed
from the same dealer,

36:26.381 --> 36:30.684
or somebody planted Joey's
weed in Jesse's car.

36:30.752 --> 36:33.186
Either way, these two
cases are connected.

36:38.908 --> 36:40.744
Are you thinking Joey Campbell
and Jesse Carr

36:40.799 --> 36:42.733
were working together,
selling marijuana?

36:42.801 --> 36:44.746
If they had a business like that
in play, we think the sheriff's

36:44.770 --> 36:46.370
office would've discovered that by now.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.539
What we do know is both of
these cases are connected,

36:48.607 --> 36:49.839
both these boys are dead,

36:49.942 --> 36:52.777
and it feels like a police cover-up.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.914
Open up a case on Joey Campbell.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.382
I want to know who murdered him.

36:58.450 --> 37:01.111
And I want to know how he
and Jesse were linked.

37:01.189 --> 37:03.921
- Yes, sir.
- Will you need extra support on this?

37:03.989 --> 37:05.890
It's a delicate situation.

37:08.571 --> 37:10.071
We think it's in the best
interest of the case

37:10.095 --> 37:11.395
if just the two of us handle it.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.164
As you wish.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.032
Keep me posted.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.201
And... good work.

37:17.269 --> 37:20.104
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

37:20.172 --> 37:21.672
- Yes!
- Finally!

37:27.613 --> 37:30.448
This is pretty damn huge, right?

37:30.516 --> 37:31.716
We got to celebrate.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.553
Do you even know how?

37:50.936 --> 37:52.069
Yeah.

37:54.173 --> 37:56.140
I see you.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.347
You mind if I ask you
something personal?

38:03.415 --> 38:06.150
Careful, you might not like
the answer you get.

38:06.218 --> 38:07.385
Thank you.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.688
You've been working at DOJ long enough

38:10.756 --> 38:12.690
to work any case you want.

38:12.758 --> 38:16.027
- Why this one?
- Justice calls, I answer.

38:16.094 --> 38:19.397
I thought maybe it was because
you wanted to make things right.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.332
Make what right?

38:21.400 --> 38:24.168
You know, the night you shot that kid.

38:24.236 --> 38:27.939
If your T.O. yells "gun"
and he's wrong, that's on him,

38:28.006 --> 38:29.907
not you.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.609
Not your fault.

38:31.677 --> 38:36.080
I don't know if I'm trying
to make it right or not.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.872
I don't know.

38:39.952 --> 38:43.120
But I think about that kid every day.

39:03.976 --> 39:05.576
Come on, boss.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.345
Let me see what you got.

39:12.251 --> 39:14.485
I don't know if I can dance
to the blues.

39:17.155 --> 39:18.589
Come on.

39:18.657 --> 39:19.857
Get your butt out here.

39:54.326 --> 39:55.912
I'm worn out, brother.

39:55.990 --> 39:57.334
- Come on, beautiful.
- Thank you.

39:57.404 --> 39:59.444
I'm sure you ain't been worn out
in a real long time.

39:59.468 --> 40:00.739
I said thank you.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.867
Hey, the lady said, "No thank you."

40:02.935 --> 40:05.603
The lady? Or your lady?

40:05.671 --> 40:07.972
All you need to know is that
she ain't your lady,

40:08.040 --> 40:08.873
so step.

40:08.941 --> 40:11.442
Step?

40:11.510 --> 40:13.277
See, that's how little boys
get in trouble,

40:13.345 --> 40:15.880
sticking their nose
in grown man business, boy.

40:15.948 --> 40:18.082
You about to find out
how much of a man he is

40:18.150 --> 40:20.551
and how much of a bitch you are.

40:24.356 --> 40:27.325
Yo, I ain't realize your chick
was that damn crazy, man.

40:27.392 --> 40:29.727
Come on, bro.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.774
You're crazy.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.199
You know, that was a yoked-ass dude

41:08.266 --> 41:09.800
you were about to fight.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.736
What, you don't think
I can handle myself?

41:11.803 --> 41:16.374
I wouldn't want you to mess up
that baby face of yours.

41:16.441 --> 41:19.777
Like you said, you need to know
I have your back.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.444
And now I do.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.342
We done good today.

41:28.473 --> 41:29.640
We did.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.775
So, I'll see you in the morning?

41:52.844 --> 41:54.078
Yeah.

41:54.146 --> 41:55.613
First thing.

42:15.867 --> 42:18.936
Even in the darkest night,
there is a truth.

42:19.004 --> 42:20.204
Yes!

42:20.272 --> 42:22.137
When your friends, your allies,

42:22.200 --> 42:24.375
they forsake you...

42:30.882 --> 42:32.450
You're welcome to join us.

42:37.789 --> 42:42.059
When your friends and allies
forsake you, there is a truth.

42:42.127 --> 42:45.162
If you don't say it, it may not be said.

42:45.230 --> 42:49.600
But as long as you have
the courage to face it,

42:49.668 --> 42:52.670
as long as you have
the courage to tell it,

42:53.322 --> 42:56.907
as long as you have
the courage to live it,

42:57.103 --> 42:59.609
the truth will prevail.
