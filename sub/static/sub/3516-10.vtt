WEBVTT

00:05.359 --> 00:07.445
The whole reason we
do these meetings, Frank,

00:07.446 --> 00:09.405
is so I can get
accurate information from you.

00:09.406 --> 00:11.365
I always said
it was going to be close.

00:11.366 --> 00:13.075
Then why did every article
I read yesterday

00:13.076 --> 00:15.869
say the leadership was
confident the bill would pass?

00:15.870 --> 00:17.538
- Do you know Janine Skorsky?

00:17.539 --> 00:19.206
- She used to be the Herald's
White House correspondent.

00:19.207 --> 00:20.707
I remember Janine.

00:20.708 --> 00:22.418
She wrote
an article for Slugline

00:22.419 --> 00:24.336
reporting
a verified vote count.

00:24.337 --> 00:26.380
Once the media got ahold of
that, it went everywhere.

00:26.381 --> 00:28.840
I don't know where she got that number.
Maybe she made it up.

00:28.841 --> 00:30.801
It doesn't matter
if she made it up.

00:30.802 --> 00:33.220
The democrats seem divided. The
leadership looks incompetent.

00:33.221 --> 00:35.680
But compared the the budget
and our education act,

00:35.681 --> 00:37.224
why, this was
a minor bill, sir.

00:37.225 --> 00:39.684
That happened to be
in the national spotlight,

00:39.685 --> 00:41.103
which is what you wanted.

00:41.104 --> 00:42.563
I got the count wrong.

00:42.564 --> 00:45.399
It rarely happens,
but it happens.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.359
What worries me is that
the White House's influence

00:47.360 --> 00:49.111
isn't translating
into support on the hill.

00:49.112 --> 00:51.238
Linda's involvement
had no effect?

00:51.239 --> 00:53.865
I wouldn't say
that that's the case, sir.

00:53.866 --> 00:56.494
Did you sense any push-back, any
fallout from the education battle?

00:56.495 --> 00:58.537
Sir, the truth is
I wasn't there.

00:58.538 --> 01:01.248
I had to make a trip
to California

01:01.249 --> 01:03.292
to meet the Provost of Stanford
for my son.

01:03.293 --> 01:04.793
I told you about it last week.

01:04.794 --> 01:07.004
It was my decision, sir.
I made a judgment call

01:07.005 --> 01:09.006
that we could pass the bill
without her help.

01:09.007 --> 01:11.008
But, look,
tight votes like this,

01:11.009 --> 01:12.510
you can analyze them to death,

01:12.511 --> 01:14.386
but at the end of the day,
we came up short.

01:14.387 --> 01:17.306
That's my fault, no one else's.
Certainly not Linda's.

01:17.307 --> 01:20.809
I shouldn't have gone.
The meeting didn't even work.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.769
I thought you said
they were reconsidering.

01:22.770 --> 01:24.396
No. I got an e-mail
this morning.

01:24.397 --> 01:26.773
They decided not to overturn
the admissions decision.

01:26.774 --> 01:28.567
Oh, Christ. I'm sorry, Linda.

01:28.568 --> 01:29.943
Not a great day so far.

01:29.944 --> 01:32.655
But I appreciate your covering
for me in there.

01:35.282 --> 01:39.911
There may be a way to turn Linda's
bad luck into my good fortune.

01:39.912 --> 01:42.956
But first I must deal
with treason within the ranks...

01:42.957 --> 01:45.584
the two renegades
who voted against the bill.

01:45.585 --> 01:47.670
I have zero tolerance
for betrayal,

01:47.671 --> 01:50.881
which they will soon
indelibly learn.

03:30.476 --> 03:32.853
I know why you lost the vote.

03:34.189 --> 03:37.065
Somebody got to Vanderburgh
and Abrams.

03:37.066 --> 03:39.193
Remy Danton.

03:39.194 --> 03:41.362
Your wife.

03:41.363 --> 03:43.822
I've got contacts
on both their staffs.

03:43.823 --> 03:46.116
There was a meeting
between the three of them.

03:46.117 --> 03:47.993
I know. I arranged it.

03:47.994 --> 03:51.372
- She told them to vote no.
- No, not true.

03:51.373 --> 03:55.334
Sources on two different staffs
saying the exact same thing?

03:55.335 --> 03:56.668
That makes no sense.

03:56.669 --> 03:58.753
I'm not telling you
what makes sense,

03:58.754 --> 04:00.714
I'm telling you facts.

04:01.923 --> 04:05.593
This is a juicy story, Francis.

04:05.594 --> 04:07.262
Carly will love it.

04:07.263 --> 04:09.931
The majority whip's wife
stabs him in the back.

04:09.932 --> 04:11.225
Be careful, Zoe.

04:11.226 --> 04:14.811
I'm feeding you.
Now you have to feed me.

04:14.812 --> 04:17.647
So give me something better.

04:20.317 --> 04:22.861
Are you going
to answer my question?

04:22.862 --> 04:25.697
Did she or didn't she?

04:25.698 --> 04:29.117
Tell me now, or so help me God,

04:29.118 --> 04:30.744
I will make it
my mission in life

04:30.745 --> 04:32.662
to not only
destroy your careers,

04:32.663 --> 04:35.457
but to obliterate all hope
and happiness

04:35.458 --> 04:38.419
that you manage to cling to.

04:38.420 --> 04:40.670
- She said it would be okay...
- To backstab me?

04:40.671 --> 04:42.506
To do what we thought
was right.

04:42.507 --> 04:44.508
So she did tell you to vote no.

04:44.509 --> 04:48.053
She said it wouldn't be the end
of the world if the bill failed.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.431
Those were her exact words.

04:53.141 --> 04:56.853
You discuss this with no one.
Is that understood?

05:00.482 --> 05:01.900
Do you blame yourself
for not being

05:01.901 --> 05:03.318
in Washington to
secure the votes?

05:03.319 --> 05:05.487
A bill this size is a team effort.
There are a lot of sponsors.

05:05.488 --> 05:06.760
- But you were the chief
sponsor and the bill manager.

05:06.761 --> 05:08.031
- That's true.

05:08.032 --> 05:10.200
So shouldn't you
have been in Washington?

05:10.201 --> 05:11.577
I'm running for Governor.
I have a

05:11.578 --> 05:12.953
commitment to the
people of my state.

05:12.954 --> 05:14.580
Are you aware
that the swofford campaign

05:14.581 --> 05:16.498
is putting out a new
commercial today that says,

05:16.499 --> 05:19.167
quote, "if Peter Russo can't
follow through in congress",

05:19.168 --> 05:20.586
can he follow through
with sobriety?"

05:20.587 --> 05:22.087
That's all.
Thank you very much.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.047
- Do you want to comment?
- Thanks, guys.

05:24.048 --> 05:26.508
Congressman!

05:26.509 --> 05:29.177
All I said was what you always
say... to vote their conscience.

05:29.178 --> 05:31.179
You encouraged them to defy me.

05:31.180 --> 05:32.889
I met with them.
That's what you asked me...

05:32.890 --> 05:34.766
no, that is not what you did.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.978
I specifically told you I needed
them to vote yes on this bill.

05:37.979 --> 05:40.021
There was no room
for interpretation.

05:40.022 --> 05:42.483
It's a deliberate lie, so don't
try to sugarcoat it, Claire.

05:42.484 --> 05:46.069
I needed Remy's help.
You wouldn't offer any.

05:46.070 --> 05:49.030
Oh, wait.

05:49.031 --> 05:51.116
You did this for Remy?

05:51.117 --> 05:53.140
No. For myself. To get my
shipment out of Sudan.

05:53.141 --> 05:55.162
He provided assistance.

05:55.163 --> 05:57.498
In exchange
for defeating the bill.

05:57.499 --> 05:59.958
No. In exchange
for not helping it succeed.

05:59.959 --> 06:03.295
Which is the same goddamn thing.
Do you realize you have endangered

06:03.296 --> 06:05.297
everything that we have
been working toward?

06:05.298 --> 06:07.090
There was a timetable here,
Claire.

06:07.091 --> 06:09.675
We needed strong momentum
right up until the last minute.

06:09.676 --> 06:12.429
I can't operate based on plans
you haven't shared with me.

06:12.430 --> 06:14.680
Then you should've
asked me first.

06:14.681 --> 06:16.350
No, I'm not going to
ask for your blessing

06:16.351 --> 06:18.018
on every decision
I make, Francis.

06:18.019 --> 06:20.020
We make decisions together.

06:20.021 --> 06:22.981
Yeah, well, it hasn't felt like that.
Not for the past six months.

06:22.982 --> 06:26.568
I don't feel as though
I'm standing beside you.

06:31.281 --> 06:34.700
Other people know, Claire.

06:35.869 --> 06:39.414
This could become
a story about us.

06:39.415 --> 06:40.458
- And that's something
you do not recover from.

06:40.459 --> 06:41.500
- Who?

06:41.501 --> 06:42.689
- That's something that
follows you for life.

06:42.690 --> 06:43.877
- Who knows?

06:45.170 --> 06:46.754
Zoe.

06:48.382 --> 06:51.510
I thought you said
she could be trusted.

06:51.511 --> 06:55.180
- What about our trust?
- You can't control her, can you, Francis?

06:55.181 --> 06:57.516
She wouldn't have been a problem
if you hadn't lied.

06:57.517 --> 06:58.684
No, she wouldn't
have been a problem

06:58.685 --> 06:59.851
if you hadn't
dropped your pants.

06:59.852 --> 07:02.979
And you come in here,
to my office, and berate me

07:02.980 --> 07:05.065
when you're the one
who's exposed us?

07:05.066 --> 07:06.900
Don't you try
to turn this around on me.

07:06.901 --> 07:09.611
I fired half of my staff for us.

07:09.612 --> 07:11.655
I have turned down
donations for us.

07:11.656 --> 07:13.281
I drafted Peter's bill for us.

07:13.282 --> 07:16.660
I diverted time and energy
away from my goals for us.

07:16.661 --> 07:18.620
Okay, I don't wanna
have to say this,

07:18.621 --> 07:20.788
but maybe you need to hear it.

07:20.789 --> 07:26.086
C.W.I. Is important, yes,

07:26.087 --> 07:30.048
but it doesn't come close to what
we are trying to accomplish.

07:30.049 --> 07:31.925
You must see that!

07:34.720 --> 07:38.348
I'm just being honest.

07:38.349 --> 07:40.392
Then be honest about
how you've been using me

07:40.393 --> 07:42.060
just like you use
everybody else.

07:42.061 --> 07:44.730
That was never part
of the bargain.

07:52.362 --> 07:54.448
Is it the hot flashes?

08:00.995 --> 08:03.331
Get out.

08:04.666 --> 08:06.710
Get out.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.552
I'll see you back at the house.

08:25.813 --> 08:27.773
I'm on my way to the office.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.150
- Let me call you when I get there.
- No, no. We need to talk now.

08:30.151 --> 08:32.736
I know you're upset, Peter, but
that's not going to achieve anything.

08:32.736 --> 08:34.738
I am more than upset, Frank.

08:34.739 --> 08:37.907
Change your tone.
I'm in no mood.

08:37.908 --> 08:40.076
- I don't give a fuck!
- Good-bye, Peter.

08:40.077 --> 08:42.412
You hang up on me now,
you're not gonna appreciate

08:42.413 --> 08:43.955
who I call next.

08:43.956 --> 08:46.874
- Excuse me?
- I promised my people jobs.

08:46.875 --> 08:49.586
You promised me
you could get this bill passed.

08:49.587 --> 08:52.380
You failed on your promise.
I'm not gonna fail on mine.

08:52.381 --> 08:54.007
So however you need to fix it,

08:54.008 --> 08:55.467
you figure it out.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.010
Otherwise,

08:57.011 --> 08:59.387
I go public with Kapeniak
and the Kern editorial.

09:01.765 --> 09:03.850
You need to cool
down and think very

09:03.851 --> 09:05.935
carefully about
what you just said.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.689
You don't understand. I'm not
afraid of you anymore, Frank.

09:08.690 --> 09:11.483
- Then you're misguided.
- My past is out in the open.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.443
You don't hold that
over my head anymore.

09:13.444 --> 09:15.111
They don't know
everything, Peter.

09:15.112 --> 09:18.406
You destroy me,
you destroy yourself.

09:18.407 --> 09:20.367
Fix it.

09:22.995 --> 09:26.039
- What do you want me to do?
- We have to accelerate things.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.751
Isn't it too early? It's almost two
full months into the election.

09:29.752 --> 09:31.086
- That gives the White House
too much time to vet somebody.

09:31.087 --> 09:32.420
- Peter's crossed the line.

09:32.421 --> 09:34.881
We built up his confidence, and
now we're losing control of him.

09:34.882 --> 09:36.633
Maybe he was just
blowing off steam.

09:36.634 --> 09:38.926
No. He's determined.
We have to act now.

09:38.927 --> 09:40.762
You have everything you need
on your end?

09:40.763 --> 09:42.263
Give me a when and a where.

09:42.264 --> 09:43.807
Some sort
of social setting's preferable.

09:43.808 --> 09:46.142
- Anything else?
- I'll need cash.

09:46.143 --> 09:47.686
About three grand.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.855
It'll be in your top drawer
by tomorrow morning.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.773
Sir...

09:53.024 --> 09:54.942
Once we do this,
we're committed.

09:54.943 --> 09:58.029
- Understood.
- I can't predict how he's gonna react.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.989
Well, I won't be blackmailed.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.537
Hello?

10:13.538 --> 10:15.830
Zoe Barnes?

10:18.750 --> 10:20.961
Yeah. Who is it?

10:20.962 --> 10:23.589
Claire Underwood.

10:27.175 --> 10:29.261
Zoe?

10:34.391 --> 10:36.435
I apologize for not buzzing.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.770
Somebody was coming in the
building when I was downstairs,

10:38.771 --> 10:41.689
so I just figured...

10:54.119 --> 10:56.288
This is nice... fire escape.

11:01.627 --> 11:03.629
Hey, could you please
not go through my things?

11:03.630 --> 11:05.339
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I intruding?

11:05.340 --> 11:07.673
Yeah, actually. You are.

11:07.674 --> 11:11.928
Well, that makes it
a two-way street, I suppose.

11:14.431 --> 11:18.352
Okay, if you...
if you came here to punish me...

11:18.353 --> 11:20.270
Fine. I get it.

11:25.276 --> 11:30.364
Such a shame,
how naive you are.

11:31.948 --> 11:34.909
- I'm not naive.
- No?

11:36.495 --> 11:39.080
I've known everything
from the beginning, Zoe.

11:39.081 --> 11:41.791
My husband and I
tell each other everything.

11:49.132 --> 11:52.093
Don't you believe me?

11:55.847 --> 11:58.600
Is there a spider I can trap?

12:02.604 --> 12:06.400
I'm not here to punish you
or to tell you to stop.

12:06.401 --> 12:10.404
I just thought I should open
those big bright eyes.

12:12.864 --> 12:15.409
I think you should leave.

12:19.413 --> 12:21.747
I think I should too.

12:28.422 --> 12:30.340
Maybe you're not that naive.

12:30.341 --> 12:33.218
A lesser woman
wouldn't have opened the door.

13:06.334 --> 13:08.712
Union station, please.

13:21.392 --> 13:24.352
This is Claire. I'm unavailable
to answer the phone,

13:24.353 --> 13:27.522
but if you leave a message, I'll be
sure and get back to you shortly.

13:27.523 --> 13:29.566
Thank...

13:37.450 --> 13:40.327
- Hello?
- Zoe.

13:46.958 --> 13:49.461
You don't have to tiptoe.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.379
I thought you fell asleep.

13:51.380 --> 13:54.549
No. Just thinking about work.

13:54.550 --> 13:57.678
I don't have anything for you yet.
I will soon.

13:57.679 --> 13:59.763
I know you will.

14:03.308 --> 14:05.686
You can spend the night
if you want.

14:05.687 --> 14:07.521
Early meetings.

14:07.522 --> 14:09.897
Wouldn't have time to get home
and change.

14:09.898 --> 14:12.818
- You seem distracted.
- I have a lot on my mind.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.778
Like what?

14:14.779 --> 14:18.281
- Work, just like you.
- No Claire?

14:20.200 --> 14:22.369
Or maybe she qualifies as work.

14:23.911 --> 14:26.331
She didn't mention anything?

14:29.334 --> 14:31.002
About...

14:31.003 --> 14:33.380
I thought you didn't
keep things from each other.

14:33.381 --> 14:36.383
Look, just say
what you want to say.

14:37.425 --> 14:39.969
She came by here
a few hours ago.

14:39.970 --> 14:42.723
We had a nice little talk.

14:44.766 --> 14:46.727
Don't let me keep you.

14:46.728 --> 14:49.187
You should go home,
get some rest.

14:55.193 --> 14:58.029
Tell Claire I said hi.

14:59.989 --> 15:02.075
Hey!

15:09.667 --> 15:11.835
This is Claire.
I'm unavailable to answer...

15:16.047 --> 15:20.093
The lights in the Whartons' house
will go on in a few moments.

15:20.094 --> 15:24.514
They always get up
precisely at quarter to 7:00,

15:24.515 --> 15:28.685
which is just the time that Claire
would be going for her run,

15:28.686 --> 15:31.145
if she were here.

15:34.858 --> 15:37.193
Rebellion on all fronts...

15:37.194 --> 15:41.322
Claire, Zoe, Russo.

15:41.323 --> 15:43.867
I must not lose my resolve.

15:43.868 --> 15:45.869
I will march forward,

15:45.870 --> 15:48.204
even if I have to do so...

15:48.205 --> 15:50.624
Alone.

15:50.625 --> 15:53.209
See? Told ya.

15:53.210 --> 15:56.546
- Good morning.
- Ohh!

15:56.547 --> 15:58.423
Hi, Frank.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.467
- How are you?
- I'm good.

16:00.468 --> 16:03.845
- Have you heard from Claire?
- Yeah, I got her message.

16:03.846 --> 16:07.056
- How's she feeling?
- A lot better.

16:07.057 --> 16:09.559
Good. She said she'd be gone
for the rest of the week.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.561
- Is it the flu or something?
- Something like that.

16:11.562 --> 16:14.230
I just came over to pick up
a few things from her office.

16:14.231 --> 16:16.733
- I could've sent somebody over.
- Oh, no. It's no big deal.

16:16.734 --> 16:19.110
In fact, I also came here
to ask you a favor.

16:19.111 --> 16:21.863
You went to Stanford, correct?

16:21.864 --> 16:24.073
- Valedictorian?
- Yeah.

16:24.074 --> 16:27.452
- Do you know the provost?
- Warren Tynsdale.

16:27.453 --> 16:30.288
He flies me out
to do fund-raising events.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.958
Supposedly I'm the poster child
for alumni.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.709
Making the world
a better place.

16:34.710 --> 16:37.128
Well, that is good,
because this is important.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.673
Linda vasquez,
the President's Chief of staff...

16:39.674 --> 16:41.257
her son, Ruben, applied.

16:41.258 --> 16:43.551
I'd love for you to get on
the phone with Tynsdale

16:43.552 --> 16:46.179
and tell him
that they should accept him.

16:46.180 --> 16:49.474
I don't know. I...
I've never recommended anyone.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.935
All the better.
It'll carry more weight.

16:51.936 --> 16:54.855
Can I meet Ruben first?

16:54.856 --> 16:57.983
I would really
prefer that Linda not know.

16:57.984 --> 17:01.068
In fact, it would be better
if both she and Ruben

17:01.069 --> 17:03.029
believed he got in
on merit alone.

17:03.030 --> 17:06.281
Will you please do this favor
for Claire and me?

17:06.282 --> 17:08.242
And for the president.

17:10.744 --> 17:13.330
Thank you.

17:16.459 --> 17:18.670
More contrast.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.839
We need to catch
the edge of his face.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.968
Let's re-crop it. Bring it in a
quarter of an inch on the left.

17:26.470 --> 17:28.179
Would you...

17:39.065 --> 17:41.150
Somebody named Claire?

17:49.492 --> 17:51.995
Remy.

17:51.996 --> 17:54.497
You hungry?

17:54.498 --> 17:56.541
I don't eat pork.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.668
When did that happen?

17:58.669 --> 18:01.337
When we started lobbying
for the meatpacking industry.

18:02.965 --> 18:04.549
Freddy, half a rack for me,

18:04.550 --> 18:06.551
and some Collard Greens
for my friend here.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.386
I'm good. I already ate lunch.

18:08.387 --> 18:10.304
Half a rack coming up.

18:10.305 --> 18:12.265
I don't usually
do business here.

18:12.266 --> 18:13.808
This is my little secret.

18:13.809 --> 18:16.269
I'd love it
if we could keep it that way.

18:16.270 --> 18:19.564
I don't think you have to worry
about me bringing clients by.

18:22.567 --> 18:24.694
You seem tense, Remy.

18:24.695 --> 18:27.154
I assume you're upset
about the watershed bill.

18:27.155 --> 18:29.240
Not with you.
You were just doing your job.

18:29.241 --> 18:31.325
But now I have to do mine.

18:31.326 --> 18:34.079
I'd like to propose
a partnership.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.998
I'm always open
to partnerships, Frank.

18:36.999 --> 18:40.251
If Peter Russo were
a pro-natural gas candidate,

18:40.252 --> 18:43.337
how valuable would that be
to Sancorp?

18:43.338 --> 18:45.339
The watershed bill
was anti-drilling.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.592
Peter's pro-employment,
not anti-drilling.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.803
He just wants to bring
employment to his people,

18:49.804 --> 18:52.680
and Sancorp
is building refineries.

18:52.681 --> 18:54.641
Mostly on site.

18:54.642 --> 18:59.312
Do you think they would be open
to considering Philadelphia?

19:01.230 --> 19:04.358
I can talk with them,
but I can't make any promises.

19:04.359 --> 19:06.736
Oh, I don't want any promises.
Just engage with Russo.

19:06.737 --> 19:09.030
You know, give him a glimmer
of good fortune.

19:09.031 --> 19:12.575
Aw, Frank, here you go.

19:13.451 --> 19:15.411
Come on. Smell that.

19:15.412 --> 19:18.999
You sure you don't want to
reconsider your stance on pork?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.167
Brain food, brother.

19:38.726 --> 19:40.728
- I love it.
- 850.

19:40.729 --> 19:43.230
You can afford that?

19:43.231 --> 19:45.399
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.069
First and last month
are taken care of.

19:48.070 --> 19:50.488
So is the security deposit.

19:50.489 --> 19:53.407
That's to buy some furniture.

20:00.206 --> 20:02.291
I'll pay you back. I promise.

20:02.292 --> 20:04.919
It's not necessary.

20:09.590 --> 20:12.510
But I do need you to do
one thing for me.

20:14.888 --> 20:16.931
- I come across as a hypocrite.
- You need jobs.

20:16.932 --> 20:18.766
Do you really care
how you deliver them?

20:18.767 --> 20:21.394
First, I advocate for more
regulation for the watershed,

20:21.395 --> 20:23.396
then I cozy up
to the drilling interests?

20:23.397 --> 20:25.439
Yeah, but natural gas
is the future, Peter.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.193
This is an industry
that could bring 100,000 jobs

20:28.194 --> 20:29.986
into your state
over the next decade.

20:29.987 --> 20:33.031
I agree with Peter.
It seems like flip-flopping.

20:33.032 --> 20:37.202
Sancorp's lobbying efforts is
why we lost the watershed bill.

20:37.203 --> 20:41.288
But they can also be
a very powerful ally.

20:41.289 --> 20:43.708
Our message is a "fresh start."

20:43.709 --> 20:45.752
This makes you look
like business as usual.

20:45.753 --> 20:47.336
This is politics.

20:47.337 --> 20:48.963
There are seized opportunities

20:48.964 --> 20:50.757
and missed opportunities.

20:50.758 --> 20:53.467
Seize this one, Peter.

20:55.053 --> 20:58.806
Sancorp can commit to building
new refineries in Philly?

20:58.807 --> 21:01.642
Sancorp will commit
to discussing it with you.

21:01.643 --> 21:04.104
- I need more than that.
- Look, you asked me to fix a problem.

21:04.105 --> 21:07.232
I've come to you in less than
24 hours with a solution.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.776
Can you meet me halfway?

21:10.735 --> 21:12.737
What would be the first step?

21:12.738 --> 21:15.322
All right.
You remember Remy Danton?

21:15.323 --> 21:16.929
- Oh, come on. He led the charge
against the watershed bill.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.534
- I know. That's not the point.

21:18.535 --> 21:22.622
One of his other big clients is
the McNeally cancer institute.

21:22.623 --> 21:24.290
They're having
a big gala tonight...

21:24.291 --> 21:26.000
a cocktail party...
for their donors.

21:26.001 --> 21:27.543
Remy will be there.

21:27.544 --> 21:29.212
We have events in Haverford
and Gladwyne...

21:29.213 --> 21:30.922
yeah, well,
this is more important.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.715
You also have a radio interview
tomorrow morning

21:32.716 --> 21:34.217
with a local Pittsburgh station?

21:34.218 --> 21:36.385
- Yes.
- All right.

21:36.386 --> 21:38.554
Meet with Remy tonight.

21:38.555 --> 21:41.141
And if it goes well
and if you're comfortable,

21:41.142 --> 21:44.936
tomorrow morning on the radio, you
support their drilling efforts.

21:44.937 --> 21:48.064
And Remy has assured me
if you do that,

21:48.065 --> 21:50.524
he can push Sancorp
in the right direction.

21:54.904 --> 21:56.864
Cancel the events tomorrow.

21:56.865 --> 21:58.616
Head back to Philly,
do some damage control.

21:58.617 --> 22:00.952
- I'll see you tomorrow afternoon.
- Peter...

22:00.953 --> 22:02.829
please.

22:04.371 --> 22:05.957
Okay.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.209
I'm gonna go make some calls.

22:15.925 --> 22:20.387
Peter, have you mentioned anything
to her about Kapeniak or...

22:23.557 --> 22:26.144
No. I haven't mentioned it
to anybody.

22:29.022 --> 22:31.232
All right. Stamper will
come by in the morning

22:31.233 --> 22:34.277
and brief you
on the talking points.

22:38.656 --> 22:40.825
When did you take this?

22:40.826 --> 22:44.912
Oh, it was about
7:00 in the morning.

22:44.913 --> 22:47.748
The sun had just come up.

22:48.708 --> 22:51.752
You were asleep... right here.

22:53.296 --> 22:55.380
The light was perfect.

22:56.341 --> 22:58.592
I had no choice.

22:58.593 --> 23:02.930
I always slept so well
in this apartment.

23:02.931 --> 23:06.267
How long are you in town for?

23:06.268 --> 23:07.894
I don't know.

23:07.895 --> 23:10.063
I haven't decided.

23:10.980 --> 23:13.149
You have no luggage.

23:16.319 --> 23:18.612
It smells the same.

23:24.369 --> 23:26.620
Feels the same.

24:10.164 --> 24:12.083
I think Sancorp is missing out,

24:12.084 --> 24:14.710
not having a significant
presence in Philadelphia.

24:14.711 --> 24:17.504
There are advantages to centralizing
in a major urban center.

24:17.505 --> 24:20.216
But the disadvantages are
commercial real estate prices,

24:20.217 --> 24:22.093
city taxes,
building a pipeline.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.510
It's all very costly.

24:23.511 --> 24:25.138
So they'd have to
reduce costs elsewhere.

24:25.139 --> 24:27.723
- Significantly.
- How can I help with that?

24:27.724 --> 24:31.060
Statewide permitted-use zoning.
No more conditional zoning.

24:31.061 --> 24:33.146
The municipalities
are slowing down development.

24:33.147 --> 24:34.939
That's the state legislature.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.816
You come out in support
of permitted use,

24:36.817 --> 24:38.692
and you get elected Governor.

24:38.693 --> 24:40.987
That'll put pressure
on the legislature.

24:40.988 --> 24:43.823
Sancorp is very interested in having
a powerful friend in Harrisburg.

24:43.824 --> 24:45.574
My opponent's pro-drilling.

24:45.575 --> 24:48.328
Your opponent isn't asking
for refineries in Philadelphia.

24:49.787 --> 24:52.123
We prefer friends
we can count on.

24:58.754 --> 25:02.300
Have your clients listen to WZPZ
tomorrow at a quarter to 8:00.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.427
It's a Pittsburgh station.

25:05.845 --> 25:08.973
It's been a pleasure,
Congressman.

25:08.974 --> 25:11.851
I look forward
to talking again soon.

25:30.661 --> 25:33.164
You got a light?

25:33.165 --> 25:35.540
This is a cancer research event.

25:35.541 --> 25:37.502
I know. I helped organize it.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.879
- You work for the institute?
- No. The hotel.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.589
And they let you smoke here?

25:44.133 --> 25:46.844
No. The manager would kill me.

25:46.845 --> 25:49.096
Well, at least
it got you talking.

25:51.683 --> 25:54.394
Are you having a good night?
You look happy.

25:54.395 --> 25:56.854
Uh, I am. I am.
I'm having a great night.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.899
- Why?
- I just got some very good news.

25:59.900 --> 26:02.360
We should celebrate.
What are you drinking?

26:02.361 --> 26:03.986
You know,
I was just leaving, actually.

26:03.987 --> 26:05.988
You haven't even asked
my name yet.

26:05.989 --> 26:08.366
- I apologize, but I have to go.
- It's Rachel.

26:08.367 --> 26:11.118
I'm not trying to be rude, but
I got a big meeting tomorrow.

26:11.119 --> 26:13.120
Then don't be rude.
Just stay a few more minutes

26:13.121 --> 26:15.373
and keep me
from having to mingle.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.626
My date ditched me.
So if you abandon

26:17.627 --> 26:19.877
me now, that would be very rude.

26:20.920 --> 26:23.588
These heels are killing me.

26:25.550 --> 26:29.554
- Feel that. Feel that blister.
- Hey, I...

26:29.555 --> 26:31.722
I have a girlfriend.

26:31.723 --> 26:33.974
I'd be surprised if you didn't.

26:37.437 --> 26:40.814
- Why'd your date ditch you?
- Mmm. Very scandalous.

26:40.815 --> 26:42.858
Mmm, what happened?

26:45.111 --> 26:47.612
Clink glasses with me.

26:55.455 --> 26:57.373
Wow.

26:57.374 --> 26:58.665
Ooh.

27:00.377 --> 27:02.503
I'm petite,
but I can hold my liquor.

27:02.504 --> 27:04.422
Obviously.

27:04.423 --> 27:07.674
When I do get drunk, though...

27:07.675 --> 27:09.676
What then?

27:12.305 --> 27:14.348
I get undressed.

27:16.476 --> 27:18.519
What about you?

27:18.520 --> 27:21.646
What are you like
when you get drunk?

27:23.190 --> 27:26.152
- It's not pretty.
- Pretty's overrated.

27:26.153 --> 27:29.071
I like it when things
get a little bit ugly.

27:30.697 --> 27:33.534
When I work late nights,
they let me stay at the hotel

27:33.535 --> 27:35.660
so I don't have to drive home.

27:36.579 --> 27:38.998
Um...

27:38.999 --> 27:41.750
This one is yours.

27:52.553 --> 27:54.263
Room 1121.

28:13.991 --> 28:15.742
Sir?

28:15.743 --> 28:17.786
In here.

28:18.787 --> 28:22.208
You wanted to see me?

28:22.209 --> 28:25.419
I need you to locate somebody.

28:25.420 --> 28:27.921
Who?

28:27.922 --> 28:30.049
My wife.

28:33.553 --> 28:36.222
Do you have a way of doing that?

28:36.223 --> 28:38.391
I do, sir.

28:38.392 --> 28:40.560
I know a guy
in missing persons...

28:40.561 --> 28:43.229
she's not missing. I just...

28:43.230 --> 28:46.148
Don't know where she is
at the moment.

28:47.107 --> 28:49.026
I trust him.

28:49.027 --> 28:51.195
We can do this off the books.

28:52.363 --> 28:53.822
Good.

28:53.823 --> 28:56.200
I'll get on it right away.

29:06.293 --> 29:08.546
Come on. Give us another one.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.653
No. I'll tell you why.
Because my mother

29:10.654 --> 29:12.758
always used to tell
me to smile more.

29:12.759 --> 29:14.594
Always drove me crazy.
She'd say, "Claire",

29:14.595 --> 29:16.637
"why have you that scowl
all the time?

29:16.638 --> 29:18.972
You look so much more beautiful
when you smile."

29:18.973 --> 29:21.141
It was never
a real conversation.

29:21.142 --> 29:24.228
There was never, "oh, what do you
feel?" Or "what are you thinking?"

29:24.229 --> 29:26.355
Just so long as
I looked beautiful and happy.

29:26.356 --> 29:28.982
That's all she cared about.

29:28.983 --> 29:32.152
So you want me to ask you

29:32.153 --> 29:34.614
what you're thinking
and feeling?

29:34.615 --> 29:36.741
All the time.

29:38.784 --> 29:41.245
I actually do wanna know what
you're thinking and feeling.

29:41.246 --> 29:44.415
- How sad am I?
- Okay, so tell me first.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.543
- What?
- Tell me first.

29:54.300 --> 29:57.219
- I think I'd better get dressed.
- What? Why?

29:57.220 --> 29:59.972
Uh, because...

29:59.973 --> 30:02.767
I've got friends coming over,

30:02.768 --> 30:05.770
and as a host,
I should probably wear clothes.

30:05.771 --> 30:07.187
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:07.188 --> 30:10.441
- Why do you do that?
- Well, you know.

30:10.442 --> 30:13.527
- It's proper?
- Kind of.

30:46.686 --> 30:49.188
Oh, fuck.

32:09.811 --> 32:11.937
Thought you might have bailed.

32:16.066 --> 32:18.151
Sit down.

32:25.117 --> 32:27.119
Vodka or whiskey?

32:27.120 --> 32:28.954
Uh, you go ahead.

32:28.955 --> 32:32.416
Come on. You can be a good
boy downstairs, not up here.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.460
Seriously, I'm good.

32:34.461 --> 32:36.378
Whiskey, I think.

32:42.427 --> 32:44.887
So what's your good news?

32:44.888 --> 32:48.140
I wanna know
what we're celebrating.

32:48.141 --> 32:51.727
Why did your, uh...
why did your date ditch you?

32:51.728 --> 32:54.146
- I asked you first.
- I did, downstairs.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.609
He works on the hill.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.486
Some staffer or something.

33:00.487 --> 33:03.238
I don't know.
I think he's a glorified gofer.

33:03.239 --> 33:04.907
A friend set me up with him.

33:04.908 --> 33:07.701
So I said he should come
tonight, keep me company.

33:07.702 --> 33:09.703
But all he wanted to do
was schmooze.

33:09.704 --> 33:12.247
So I brought him
into the women's bathroom,

33:12.248 --> 33:14.249
told him he was being
an asshole.

33:14.250 --> 33:16.961
He told me
I was being childish.

33:16.962 --> 33:19.296
So I slapped him.

33:19.297 --> 33:21.256
You slapped him?

33:21.257 --> 33:24.134
Yeah. Big red hand mark
right across his face.

33:24.135 --> 33:26.762
I think he was embarrassed
to be seen by the Schmoozerati.

33:26.763 --> 33:28.305
So he left.

33:28.306 --> 33:30.516
And that is the last time
I go on a date

33:30.517 --> 33:33.018
with a guy who wears
a flag pin to work.

33:33.019 --> 33:37.230
I'm one of those guys
who wears a flag pin to work.

33:39.566 --> 33:41.819
This isn't really a date,
is it?

33:42.903 --> 33:45.322
I really shouldn't be here.

33:45.323 --> 33:47.741
That's what makes it fun.

33:49.994 --> 33:53.246
Tell me your good news. I wanna
know what we're toasting to.

33:55.374 --> 33:57.501
Let's toast to you.

33:59.294 --> 34:02.130
I'm your good news?
Okay, I'll toast to that.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.771
Oh.

34:29.824 --> 34:32.284
Hey.

34:32.286 --> 34:34.580
What are you...

34:34.581 --> 34:36.748
I didn't wanna wait
at the Herald.

34:36.750 --> 34:39.167
I was gonna call you, but...

34:42.004 --> 34:44.757
Can I stay
at your place tonight?

34:44.757 --> 34:47.259
Uh, stay with me?

34:47.260 --> 34:49.428
Well, just on your couch

34:49.429 --> 34:51.931
for a night or two.

34:51.931 --> 34:53.849
Uh, why?

34:53.850 --> 34:56.268
I can't be in my apartment.

34:56.268 --> 34:59.271
- Did something happen?
- No. I...

35:01.523 --> 35:03.442
I'm sorry.

35:03.443 --> 35:05.277
Zoe.

35:09.656 --> 35:11.324
Come on.

35:12.534 --> 35:14.787
What time is the interview?

35:14.788 --> 35:17.122
Quarter to 8:00.
I'll be with him.

35:18.331 --> 35:20.333
And where's Peter now?

35:20.334 --> 35:22.335
Are you sure
you want the details?

35:22.336 --> 35:23.837
Mm.

35:25.714 --> 35:27.967
Just tell me, is it going well?

35:27.968 --> 35:29.927
Hasn't been any updates.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.762
But if it does go well,
you'll be ready?

35:31.763 --> 35:34.640
I'm ready.
I've been ready. I'm ready.

35:34.641 --> 35:37.183
- Anything else?
- We never played chess before, have we?

35:38.060 --> 35:39.979
I don't know how.

35:39.980 --> 35:42.314
You want me to teach you?

35:43.983 --> 35:45.985
I should really get some rest.

35:45.986 --> 35:48.320
Be fresh for the morning.

35:48.321 --> 35:50.155
Yeah, another time.

35:50.156 --> 35:53.408
1160, WZPZ, 7:45.

35:53.409 --> 35:57.746
Good night.

35:57.747 --> 36:00.749
I hate being kept in the dark.

36:02.167 --> 36:04.210
Waiting.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.213
Speculating.

36:08.966 --> 36:11.135
Useless.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.248
Oh, come on!

36:42.249 --> 36:44.584
- Let's dance.
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah.

36:44.585 --> 36:46.003
It's not a big deal.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.213
Come on, let's do it.

36:48.214 --> 36:50.340
- Come on, let's do it.
- No.

36:50.341 --> 36:53.510
No, please, I can't. Not now.

36:58.431 --> 36:59.766
Come on.

37:23.248 --> 37:25.167
This is really nice.

37:25.168 --> 37:28.378
Do you want anything?
Water? Juice?

37:28.379 --> 37:31.631
No, thanks. I'm good.

37:31.632 --> 37:34.509
Uh, you can have the bed.
I'll sleep on the couch.

37:34.510 --> 37:35.468
No. No.

37:35.469 --> 37:36.929
It's fine.

37:36.930 --> 37:38.972
Please, Lucas,
let me sleep on the couch.

37:38.973 --> 37:41.183
I'll feel bad.

37:41.184 --> 37:42.893
All right.

37:46.730 --> 37:49.149
- Can I help?
- I got it.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.367
So, you know,

37:59.368 --> 38:03.163
we don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

38:03.164 --> 38:07.042
But I haven't seen you
in, like,

38:07.043 --> 38:09.753
six months.

38:09.754 --> 38:12.798
Except for when I
drunkenly stalked you at your...

38:14.134 --> 38:16.342
- Right.
- That was kind of adorable.

38:16.343 --> 38:19.638
It was either psychotic or sad.

38:19.639 --> 38:21.098
Not adorable.

38:21.099 --> 38:24.059
Yes, it was.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.605
Can you hand me that pillow?

38:30.356 --> 38:32.692
So, why do you need
to get out of your apartment?

38:34.861 --> 38:37.948
It just felt small.

38:37.949 --> 38:41.034
Well, it can't
be smaller than my place.

38:41.035 --> 38:43.703
No. I don't mean size.
I mean...

38:43.704 --> 38:45.580
I felt trapped.

38:45.581 --> 38:49.209
Like I was in a place
that I didn't actually live.

38:51.211 --> 38:53.297
Does that make any sense?

38:54.756 --> 38:57.009
I guess.

39:02.388 --> 39:05.350
Okay.

39:06.351 --> 39:08.687
There you go.

39:08.688 --> 39:11.439
Um, anytime
you need to get up or...

39:11.440 --> 39:14.151
um, I'll just set an alarm
on my phone.

39:14.152 --> 39:16.444
All right.
Well, feel free to watch TV.

39:16.445 --> 39:19.198
I can sleep through anything.

39:21.325 --> 39:23.409
Hey, thank you, Lucas.

39:44.098 --> 39:47.433
Hey, that's the last of it.

39:47.434 --> 39:49.936
Better make it count, then.

40:00.446 --> 40:02.448
- Drink up.
- Mm.

40:06.536 --> 40:08.538
Mmm.

40:13.126 --> 40:15.170
Do I look familiar to you?

40:15.171 --> 40:17.047
Familiar?

40:17.048 --> 40:19.465
No.

40:19.466 --> 40:23.136
- My face? My body?
- No.

40:25.222 --> 40:27.473
How about my voice?

40:29.642 --> 40:31.311
Have we...

40:31.312 --> 40:33.688
No.

40:33.689 --> 40:35.295
No. I was just
wondering if you had a

40:35.296 --> 40:36.900
thing for brunettes
with blue eyes.

40:36.901 --> 40:40.112
- Hey, where you going? Come back here.
- I wanna see you better.

40:44.866 --> 40:46.952
Shit. The sun's up?

40:46.953 --> 40:48.661
Has been for a while.

40:48.662 --> 40:51.748
- Oh, fuck. What time is it?
- 7:15.

40:51.749 --> 40:55.501
Fuck. I have an interview
in half an hour.

40:55.502 --> 40:57.879
- Skip it.
- I can't. I gotta do it.

41:16.190 --> 41:18.566
You can keep the room
till noon.

41:32.665 --> 41:34.666
- Hello?
- I'm at your building.

41:34.667 --> 41:36.876
The front desk keeps calling
up, but there's no answer.

41:36.877 --> 41:40.713
- I'm not there.
- Then I'll come to you. Where are you?

41:40.714 --> 41:43.925
I'm... I'm at
the Park Highmore hotel.

41:43.926 --> 41:45.969
Are you okay? You sound drunk.

41:45.970 --> 41:49.139
It was, uh... yeah. Yeah.
I'm... I'm all right.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.017
- You have the interview.
- I know!

41:52.018 --> 41:53.893
Have you been drinking, Peter?

41:53.894 --> 41:57.730
Uh, what? No. Um, I just decided
to spend the night here.

41:57.731 --> 42:00.692
What room are you in?

42:00.693 --> 42:03.111
11, uh... 1121.

42:03.112 --> 42:05.905
Stay there.
I'm coming right now.

43:03.004 --> 43:06.758
Jesus, Peter. What happened?
You're drunk.

43:06.759 --> 43:09.135
- I'm fine.
- I can smell it on you.

43:09.136 --> 43:11.221
Okay, I had a drink or two.

43:11.222 --> 43:13.306
It was nothing crazy.

43:16.017 --> 43:19.438
We can't do this interview.

43:19.439 --> 43:21.565
I'm sober. I can handle it.

43:21.566 --> 43:23.567
You're slurring your words.

43:23.568 --> 43:25.651
I'm good.

43:27.737 --> 43:29.697
I think we should cancel.

43:29.698 --> 43:31.950
I'm gonna do the interview.

43:31.951 --> 43:34.911
Just give me the talking points.

43:50.427 --> 43:52.053
Sorry.

43:52.054 --> 43:53.721
Sorry. I...

43:53.722 --> 43:55.765
It's all right.

43:55.766 --> 43:59.227
The couch had a spring in it
or something, and my back...

43:59.228 --> 44:01.687
no.

44:01.688 --> 44:04.149
It's all right.

44:04.150 --> 44:06.901
I don't mind.

44:29.257 --> 44:31.301
Sir, I heard from my friend.

44:31.302 --> 44:33.845
Missing persons.

44:33.846 --> 44:35.347
And?

44:35.348 --> 44:38.308
- She's in New York.
- What hotel?

44:38.309 --> 44:41.269
Not a hotel, sir.

44:42.646 --> 44:44.981
So she's not alone.

44:44.982 --> 44:47.400
No, sir.

44:49.735 --> 44:51.737
Adam Galloway?

44:51.738 --> 44:53.657
Yes, sir.

44:54.658 --> 44:56.409
I have more information.

44:56.410 --> 44:58.911
I don't need to know.

44:58.912 --> 45:02.248
Turn on 1160 A.M.

45:05.877 --> 45:08.254
He's running to fill
Jim Matthews' old post

45:08.255 --> 45:10.089
as Governor of Pennsylvania.

45:10.090 --> 45:11.550
Glad to have you with us, sir.

45:11.551 --> 45:13.510
It's good to be here, Jim.

45:13.511 --> 45:17.180
- It's mark.
- Sorry. Right. Mark.

45:17.181 --> 45:19.183
That's okay, Congressman.
It happens all

45:19.184 --> 45:21.184
the time this early
in the morning.

45:21.185 --> 45:23.562
So, Congressman,
the watershed act.

45:23.563 --> 45:26.523
Yes. Uh, I'm ashamed of the...

45:26.524 --> 45:30.068
well, I'm not ashamed.
That's not the right, um...

45:30.069 --> 45:33.821
I'm disappointed, um,
because, you know,

45:33.822 --> 45:35.699
the water...

45:35.700 --> 45:38.577
It's, um... it's... actually,
what I'd like to discuss is...

45:38.578 --> 45:41.371
we all know that natural gas...

45:41.372 --> 45:45.458
that it's... it's a growing...
uh, in our state...

45:45.459 --> 45:47.793
it's a... it's a big part
of, um...

45:47.794 --> 45:50.880
economically,
the way things are going.

45:50.881 --> 45:54.551
And I'd like to say...
to announce...

45:54.552 --> 45:58.263
in terms of, um...

45:58.264 --> 46:00.390
Are you familiar
with drilling regulations...

46:00.391 --> 46:02.475
permitted use
versus conditional use?

46:02.476 --> 46:04.936
Are we still talking
about the watershed?

46:04.937 --> 46:06.688
No. Drilling. Natural gas.

46:06.689 --> 46:09.441
Sir, you supported
increased regulation.

46:09.442 --> 46:11.401
Well, no. I... i...

46:11.402 --> 46:13.570
it may have looked that way,
but, uh,

46:13.571 --> 46:15.947
in fact, to be clear,
I'm for less...

46:17.031 --> 46:19.534
Regulation.

46:19.535 --> 46:22.912
Yes, sir. In the watershed bill,
the language clearly stated...

46:22.913 --> 46:24.497
it didn't pass.

46:24.498 --> 46:27.250
Well, right.
That's what I'm asking about.

46:27.251 --> 46:30.420
- What about it?
- Why it didn't pass.

46:30.421 --> 46:31.671
I just said.

46:31.672 --> 46:34.549
No, sir. I don't think you did.

46:36.342 --> 46:38.219
It just didn't.

46:38.220 --> 46:39.845
Sir, three days ago,
you predicted...

46:39.846 --> 46:41.556
I'm talking about
fucking natural gas.

46:41.557 --> 46:43.433
I'm sorry.

46:43.434 --> 46:45.560
Congressman, I have
to ask you a question,

46:45.561 --> 46:47.479
and it may come across
as indelicate,

46:47.480 --> 46:49.314
but are you drunk right now?

46:49.315 --> 46:52.442
What? No. No.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

46:52.443 --> 46:54.527
I'm just... I'm really tired,
you know?

46:54.528 --> 46:57.405
I've been on the campaign trail
for a few weeks now,

46:57.406 --> 46:59.115
and...

47:01.367 --> 47:03.411
Congressman?

47:03.412 --> 47:07.081
Congressman? Congressman?

47:15.923 --> 47:17.550
It's my fault.

47:17.551 --> 47:19.678
I shouldn't have let you.

47:20.553 --> 47:22.555
I'm fucked.

47:22.556 --> 47:24.808
Okay. Listen. We sober you up.

47:24.809 --> 47:28.394
We'll make some kind of
announcement as soon as possible.

47:29.771 --> 47:31.939
There's nothing I can say.

47:31.940 --> 47:34.066
We'll figure this out.

47:34.067 --> 47:35.360
Come on.

47:35.361 --> 47:37.445
You're gonna take a shower.

47:37.446 --> 47:39.489
Come on.

47:42.408 --> 47:45.286
There you go. Come on.

47:54.128 --> 47:56.214
How bad is it?

47:56.215 --> 47:58.633
It all depends on whether it gets
picked up by the mainstream press.

47:58.634 --> 48:01.344
- Well, shall I fill in the president?
- No. Hold off on that.

48:01.345 --> 48:03.159
I need to speak to Peter,
coordinate with his campaign.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.972
You'll be the first call I make.

48:04.973 --> 48:07.642
Frank, before you go,
I got an e-mail this morning.

48:07.643 --> 48:09.185
Stanford reversed
their decision.

48:09.186 --> 48:10.729
That's wonderful.

48:10.730 --> 48:13.356
The Provo said Gillian Cole
reached out to him.

48:13.357 --> 48:16.108
I googled her.
She works for Claire.

48:16.109 --> 48:18.902
- Thank you.
- No reason to thank me.

48:18.903 --> 48:22.073
Ruben was just ecstatic. I don't
know how I'm gonna repay you.

48:22.074 --> 48:24.283
The fact that your son is happy
is more than enough.

48:24.284 --> 48:26.994
- You'll keep me posted on Peter?
- You bet.

48:26.995 --> 48:28.454
Okay.

48:34.377 --> 48:35.670
Hey, boss.

48:35.671 --> 48:37.963
- Are you still with him?
- Yeah.

48:37.964 --> 48:40.383
- He's taking a shower.
- How're we looking?

48:40.384 --> 48:42.134
Zoe Barnes posted
ten minutes ago.

48:42.135 --> 48:44.637
It's already on
the New York times web site.

48:44.638 --> 48:47.056
The kid is done.

48:47.057 --> 48:49.434
Have Nancy set up a meeting
with the Vice President.

48:49.435 --> 48:51.977
- Today if possible.
- Will do.

48:51.978 --> 48:54.230
And keep an eye on Peter.
He's done his duty.

48:54.231 --> 48:56.274
- Let's get him back on his feet.
- You got it.

48:56.275 --> 48:59.193
And now Jim Matthews comes to the fore,

48:59.194 --> 49:01.028
though he doesn't know it yet.

49:01.029 --> 49:03.698
He will find solace
in his beloved Pennsylvania,

49:03.699 --> 49:07.285
though Peter Russo
will find solace nowhere.

49:07.286 --> 49:10.580
It only takes ten seconds
to crush a man's ambitions.

49:10.581 --> 49:13.625
I need to take care
that I protect mine.

49:23.676 --> 49:25.804
Peter.

49:28.890 --> 49:30.974
Peter!

49:33.060 --> 49:35.396
Peter?

49:35.397 --> 49:37.106
Hey!

49:37.107 --> 49:37.907
Peter?

49:41.723 --> 49:44.902
