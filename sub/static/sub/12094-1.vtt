01:03.230 --> 01:04.732
I'm sorry.

01:16.743 --> 01:20.088
If you keep on doing
what you've always done,

01:20.089 --> 01:23.093
you'll keep on being
what you've always been,

01:26.112 --> 01:27.921
I used lo share a cell
with a guy

01:27.922 --> 01:30.425
who had those words
tattooed across his chest

01:30.426 --> 01:34.374
in Japanese characters.

01:34.375 --> 01:36.719
After ten years,
the guy gets out.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.666
A week later,
he gels himself killed

01:38.667 --> 01:42.638
for being
what he'd always been.

01:42.639 --> 01:45.051
Those words
are still on his skin,

01:45.052 --> 01:47.396
buried in a box somewhere.

01:49.943 --> 01:53.982
Nothing changes
unless you make it change.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.619
He?

01:59.620 --> 02:02.464
In case you need me,
call this number.

02:02.465 --> 02:05.275
They'll know where I am.

02:05.276 --> 02:07.950
Take care.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.284
Daddy!

02:23.285 --> 02:24.821
Hi!

03:01.848 --> 03:03.987
Don't leave town.

03:03.988 --> 03:06.195
Don't associate with anyone
with a record.

03:06.196 --> 03:08.733
You so much as jaywalk,
you're back in.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.239
All right, we're done here.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.878
You just let me know
when you find a job,

03:18.879 --> 03:20.586
and I'll file the papers.

03:20.587 --> 03:21.725
Cool.

03:25.505 --> 03:28.543
Your parole officer can be
your pal or a son of a bitch.

03:28.544 --> 03:31.423
It's your decision. You got me?

03:31.424 --> 03:32.767
Yeah.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.234
J' tell you,
I thought I had it made j'

03:59.279 --> 04:01.418
Rodney around?

04:01.419 --> 04:02.762
No, man.

04:02.763 --> 04:05.300
Rodney's dead.

04:05.301 --> 04:07.941
How about selma?

04:07.942 --> 04:11.151
No. She, uh-she split out west.

04:11.152 --> 04:13.291
I bought the place...

04:13.292 --> 04:15.932
Shit, six years ago now.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.267
You wouldn't happen to keep
a bottle of bowman's

04:20.269 --> 04:22.613
under the bar for luck,
would you'?

04:22.614 --> 04:24.958
So you did know Rodney'

04:27.400 --> 04:29.141
guess old habits die hard'

04:29.142 --> 04:30.746
how you take it'?

04:30.747 --> 04:33.626
Neat.

04:33.627 --> 04:38.804
' Yeah, before I knew it,
I was a teenager.

04:38.805 --> 04:41.445
Yeah, when, uh...

04:41.446 --> 04:43.790
When I took over, guys would
come in from time to time,

04:43.791 --> 04:46.897
saying Rodney owed 'em money
for this and that,

04:46.898 --> 04:48.241
pulling some shit.

04:50.689 --> 04:53.363
Hasn't happened
in a couple centuries, though.

05:19.452 --> 05:24.026
It's supposed to catch
thieves, not ghosts.

05:24.027 --> 05:26.701
If you've come for the money,
you're...

05:26.702 --> 05:28.739
It's all gone now.

05:28.740 --> 05:33.052
I had to pay off a lot of cops
to stay out of prison.

05:33.053 --> 05:34.896
That's a thousand years ago.

05:34.898 --> 05:36.741
Yeah, I figured.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.246
You still in touch
with any of the old crowd?

05:42.247 --> 05:43.749
Mike?

05:45.512 --> 05:48.686
He's dead. Died in prison'

05:48.687 --> 05:50.928
hmm. Matt'?

05:50.929 --> 05:52.272
- Dead too-
- How about sal?

05:52.273 --> 05:54.014
Don'! Tell me he's dead.

05:54.015 --> 05:55.619
- He's not dead.
- Good.

05:55.620 --> 05:59.067
He's in a coma, up at grace.

05:59.068 --> 06:01.742
Pretty high mortality rate
in the old business.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.875
Gretchen'?

06:06.876 --> 06:09.516
What happened to your hand?

06:09.517 --> 06:12.862
Past caught up with me.

06:12.863 --> 06:14.308
Nobody gets to make
a fresh start.

06:14.309 --> 06:16.585
You know that.

06:18.567 --> 06:19.944
My kids
will be coming home soon.

06:19.945 --> 06:22.926
They don't know anything
about the old days,

06:22.927 --> 06:24.372
I'm glad to see you,

06:24.373 --> 06:28.048
but I don't want you
coming around here, foley.

06:28.049 --> 06:32.193
Even.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.441
Who the hell are you?

07:18.271 --> 07:21.115
I'm disappointed.

07:21.117 --> 07:24.462
You don't see it'?

07:24.463 --> 07:27.034
The chin?

07:27.035 --> 07:28.878
Jawline?

07:31.251 --> 07:33.754
I know I've got his eyes.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.436
Yeah, I see it.

07:38.437 --> 07:39.677
You're Eddie's kid, right'?

07:39.678 --> 07:46.529
That's right Ethan,
that's a good memory.

07:46.530 --> 07:49.409
Been a long time.
More than 20 years.

07:49.410 --> 07:50.684
25.

07:50.685 --> 07:53.097
My mistake.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.941
A man does that kind
of hard time,

07:54.942 --> 07:57.445
you don't want to get
the numbers wrong.

08:00.447 --> 08:05.055
I can't blame you
for being suspicious.

08:05.056 --> 08:09.698
I mean, here I am,
sitting in the dark,

08:09.699 --> 08:11.178
waiting for you,

08:11.179 --> 08:14.649
what do you want from me,
Ethan?

08:14.650 --> 08:16.596
I just...

08:19.699 --> 08:21.700
I just want to buy you a drink.

08:43.923 --> 08:47.234
I got a 35% stake
in this place.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.578
Easy money.

08:48.579 --> 08:50.456
Kind of owe it
to you and my dad.

08:50.460 --> 08:55.409
My mom told me your big plan
was to cash out and open a club.

08:56.981 --> 08:58.585
We wanted to open a bar,

08:58.586 --> 09:01.123
not whatever this is!

09:03.332 --> 09:05.608
Here, let me show you.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.417
Grab a drink.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.898
Talk about the, uh, old days,

09:13.899 --> 09:15.970
maybe talk about the new days.

09:19.283 --> 09:20.921
Hey!

09:20.923 --> 09:23.096
Xaviers here, and he wants
to see you and me in the back,

09:23.097 --> 09:24.098
okay.

09:24.099 --> 09:26.978
Come here. Listen.

09:26.979 --> 09:29.357
Take him to my seat.
Everything is on the house.

09:29.358 --> 09:31.099
I'll be right back.

09:51.391 --> 09:54.133
You're alone.

09:54.134 --> 09:56.512
Doesn't seem right.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.993
I'm waiting for someone.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.815
I've been waiting
for someone too.

10:05.816 --> 10:07.295
I just found him.

10:07.296 --> 10:10.436
Thanks, but no thanks.

10:10.437 --> 10:13.441
Ethan told me to stop by'

10:13.442 --> 10:15.183
said he had someone
who'd like to meet me.

10:15.184 --> 10:17.824
Hey! I see you two have met.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.532
You get rid of her'?

10:19.533 --> 10:20.910
Ease up.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.357
Wound that tight,
you'll give yourself a stroke.

10:23.358 --> 10:24.701
I'm not interested

10:24.702 --> 10:29.048
in whatever it is
you're selling.

10:29.049 --> 10:30.585
Yeah?

10:30.586 --> 10:31.929
Well, you can go fuck yourself,

10:31.930 --> 10:35.605
because I'm definitely
not gonna.

10:35.606 --> 10:38.780
You still owe me that gram.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.453
That was something.

10:44.454 --> 10:46.127
I'm leaving.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.654
Look, foley,
I'll take you home,

10:49.655 --> 10:51.657
but could you just give me
one minute?

10:51.658 --> 10:54.332
Just hang back a second.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.998
This is what we like to see,

11:01.999 --> 11:05.572
empty bottles
means business is good.

11:05.573 --> 11:07.814
A veuve, dom, cristal..

11:07.815 --> 11:10.318
Very nice, but, uh...

11:10.319 --> 11:12.595
Oh! What have we here?

11:12.596 --> 11:15.839
The '96 billecart-salmon.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.547
It's a shame to open this'

11:18.687 --> 11:20.928
Really, it needs
another 10 or 15 years.

11:20.929 --> 11:23.307
But if you're some
hedge fund shithead

11:23.308 --> 11:26.551
trying to pry into the pants
of some poor, unfortunate girl,

11:26.552 --> 11:30.728
well, you need to do
what you need to do.

11:33.904 --> 11:36.077
I had the '59 a few weeks ago.

11:36.078 --> 11:37.853
It was absolutely spectacular.

11:37.854 --> 11:43.964
The minerality weaves
the elements together like silk.

11:43.965 --> 11:46.275
I love champagne,

11:46.276 --> 11:49.280
I drink a lot of it because
I have a lot to celebrate.

11:49.281 --> 11:54.287
Life is good
when my people do their jobs.

11:54.288 --> 11:59.397
This happened on your watch,
Ethan.

11:59.398 --> 12:01.139
It won't happen again.

12:01.140 --> 12:04.144
Xavier, I'm the one that
caught the stupid motherfucker.

12:04.145 --> 12:05.932
And that's why, one day,
if you're a good boy,

12:05.982 --> 12:10.041
I'll let you try the-the '59.

12:10.091 --> 12:13.947
Our colleague here
won't have that opportunity,

12:13.997 --> 12:16.614
so you thought, what,
that I wouldn't notice?

12:16.664 --> 12:20.217
$250.000!

12:20.267 --> 12:21.385
And I wouldn't notice?

12:35.655 --> 12:39.404
Gonna be kind of tough
to get the money back now.

12:39.454 --> 12:42.235
You'll find a way.

12:43.997 --> 12:47.144
Have a safe flight.

12:49.497 --> 12:50.715
Deal with it.

12:50.765 --> 12:52.484
Foley. Foley.

12:52.534 --> 12:55.486
Just... Give me a
minute, please.

12:55.536 --> 12:57.924
I got out of prison yesterday.
Yesterday!

12:57.974 --> 12:58.945
I know.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.591
I know, and I'm sorry for that,

13:00.641 --> 13:02.427
but just listen to me.

13:02.477 --> 13:05.764
I thought that we would go out,
you know'?

13:05.814 --> 13:07.667
Have a drink.

13:07.717 --> 13:12.966
I guess I was just trying to
show you that I'm like my dad.

13:15.295 --> 13:19.775
But the truth is,

13:19.825 --> 13:23.582
I never really knew the guy,

13:23.632 --> 13:24.849
you know, my mom, she was...

13:24.899 --> 13:27.044
What do you want from me,
Ethan?

13:29.942 --> 13:32.889
I want to know
why you killed my father.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.979
Still a lot of money
to be made down there.

13:55.029 --> 13:58.649
Just how much do you know
about me and your dad?

13:58.699 --> 14:01.818
Only what my mom told me,

14:01.868 --> 14:06.122
that you were best
friends, partners.

14:06.172 --> 14:08.494
She tell you what we did?
Our work'?

14:08.544 --> 14:10.515
. No.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.655
But I figured it out.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.577
It's everything I could find.

14:24.627 --> 14:28.346
Every article, every picture.

14:28.396 --> 14:29.845
Why would you keep all this?

14:29.895 --> 14:31.515
How else
could I get to know him?

14:31.565 --> 14:33.352
You were grifters,

14:33.402 --> 14:37.219
best in the city, according
to a lot of the old-timers.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.749
Ethan, you need to let this go.

15:02.799 --> 15:04.583
Your dad's been dead
a long time.

15:04.633 --> 15:06.885
No, I need to know.

15:06.935 --> 15:09.443
Foley,
put yourself in my shoes.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.201
We were on the grift...

15:21.251 --> 15:24.435
A long con with a volatile mark

15:24.485 --> 15:28.105
but with a high yield
if it played.

15:28.155 --> 15:31.241
And it played.

15:31.291 --> 15:32.578
Till your dad got greedy

15:32.628 --> 15:35.279
and tried to squeeze the mark
loo hard,

15:35.329 --> 15:37.914
I never figured out why.

15:37.964 --> 15:40.049
He was in debt.

15:40.099 --> 15:44.253
He was way over his
head, cards, horses.

15:44.303 --> 15:46.957
Took my mom years
to get out from under it.

15:47.007 --> 15:48.981
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.299
Mark was a heavy hitter.

15:53.349 --> 15:56.298
Didn't take well
to being ripped off.

15:56.348 --> 16:02.328
Kill your dad, or I
could die with him.

16:15.136 --> 16:18.958
I'm sorry.

16:30.289 --> 16:33.639
I spent a long time
in a very small room

16:33.689 --> 16:36.475
thinking about
the choices I made that night.

16:36.525 --> 16:39.965
I was young,
younger than you are now,

16:39.966 --> 16:42.146
but I made a choice.

16:42.196 --> 16:44.713
I never broke frame,

16:44.763 --> 16:46.739
and I was punished for it.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.321
What was his name?

16:51.371 --> 16:53.389
The mark'

16:53.439 --> 16:55.413
what's it matter?

16:55.414 --> 16:56.694
He was the mark.

16:56.744 --> 16:58.165
Your dad put us both
in a corner,

16:58.215 --> 17:00.499
and there was only one way out.

17:00.549 --> 17:02.334
Well, if somebody
did that to me,

17:02.384 --> 17:06.172
I'd kill him too.

17:06.222 --> 17:07.865
I'm just saying...

17:10.363 --> 17:11.406
I understand.

17:11.457 --> 17:12.541
You understand?

17:12.592 --> 17:13.643
Yeah, I do,

17:13.693 --> 17:16.178
and I think we can help
each other.

17:16.228 --> 17:18.652
Look at me, Ethan.

17:18.702 --> 17:22.088
25 years of my life are gone.

17:22.137 --> 17:24.388
Now, if you're as smart
as you think you are,

17:24.439 --> 17:26.089
you should go in this room,

17:26.140 --> 17:28.325
rip that shit down
off that wall,

17:28.375 --> 17:30.994
and throw it away!

18:52.798 --> 18:54.112
This isn't the kind of thing

18:54.162 --> 18:55.677
where we got to make small talk,
is it'?

18:55.727 --> 18:57.203
Can I just watch my game?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.030
Pitcher of your cheapest.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.465
Sit anywhere you like.

19:12.515 --> 19:14.834
You think'?

19:14.884 --> 19:17.366
Oh, shit.

19:17.416 --> 19:19.131
Watch it.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.395
I said no. Get off me.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.733
Got to go to the bathroom-
shit.

19:50.017 --> 19:52.304
Oh. Damn.

19:52.354 --> 19:54.600
Always choke in the clutch.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.286
' No!

20:40.336 --> 20:42.307
Leave it be.

20:42.308 --> 20:44.811
He's bad business'

20:46.412 --> 20:48.226
No, no.

20:48.276 --> 20:49.392
Please stop.

20:49.442 --> 20:50.414
Shut up.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.561
Please stop.

20:51.611 --> 20:53.033
She said stop.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.097
Get the fuck out of here!

20:55.147 --> 20:57.431
After you.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.082
Hey. Hey.
He can't hurt you now.

21:10.132 --> 21:12.952
Put it down. Put it down.

21:17.937 --> 21:20.225
God damn.

21:28.483 --> 21:30.634
It's-it's all right.

21:30.684 --> 21:33.938
It's okay. Hey.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.461
How you know this guy?

21:36.462 --> 21:37.843
I just met him tonight.

21:37.893 --> 21:41.612
He was supposed
to go get me some...

21:41.662 --> 21:44.449
Hey, you're that freak
from the other night.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.025
Beautiful.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.999
For your trouble.

22:01.049 --> 22:03.369
What about your cut'?

22:03.419 --> 22:04.703
I wasn't even here.

22:04.753 --> 22:09.507
What about the girl?
She's waiting inside.

22:09.557 --> 22:11.208
Tell her I said good night,

22:33.419 --> 22:35.065
Good to go.

22:37.216 --> 22:38.190
Oh, the pipes!

22:40.785 --> 22:42.761
Hey!

22:44.196 --> 22:45.341
What the hell happened?

22:45.391 --> 22:46.745
I could have been
fucking killed!

22:46.795 --> 22:48.180
Ll don't know.
It was all secure.

22:48.230 --> 22:49.244
I don't give a shit!

22:49.294 --> 22:50.683
You come to work
looking like hell!

22:50.733 --> 22:51.704
You almost killed my guy!

22:51.705 --> 22:53.749
Now, get off my site! Now!

22:53.799 --> 22:55.187
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:55.237 --> 22:56.521
Brother man, hey, look.

22:56.571 --> 22:57.754
I need this job.

22:57.804 --> 22:59.388
Look, I will make it
worth your while.

22:59.438 --> 23:01.091
I will kick back double
what you asked'

23:01.141 --> 23:03.354
this shit could never be
worth my while.

23:19.365 --> 23:22.471
Hey, at least new
you have time for coffee.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.381
Ethan, did you have
anything to do

23:26.431 --> 23:27.854
with what happened back there?

23:27.904 --> 23:29.119
Of course not.

23:29.169 --> 23:30.787
'Cause I need this job
for my parole.

23:30.837 --> 23:32.022
I have to make money.

23:32.072 --> 23:36.558
Oh, you have needs? Tell me.

23:36.608 --> 23:40.399
What do you need?

23:40.449 --> 23:41.919
I thought I made myself clear.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.370
Oh, yeah, that's right.

23:43.420 --> 23:45.771
You're going straight.

23:45.821 --> 23:49.761
The same thing
every con says at first.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.610
But you're not every con.

23:51.660 --> 23:54.080
You've got skills,
skills I can use.

23:54.130 --> 23:56.602
What are you talking about'?

23:59.438 --> 24:02.450
I'm putting together a grift

24:02.500 --> 24:03.552
and not just any grift.

24:03.602 --> 24:06.290
I've got the perfect mark

24:06.340 --> 24:09.729
for the samaritan.

24:09.779 --> 24:11.928
That's what I'm talking about.

24:11.978 --> 24:15.267
That's why I need you on board.

24:15.317 --> 24:20.906
That's your grift,
you and my dad.

24:20.956 --> 24:25.744
I'm not your dad, Ethan,
and I don'! Want to be.

24:31.136 --> 24:37.314
You know, my mom was alone
for a long time.

24:39.345 --> 24:44.793
But when I'm 17,
she brings home this new guy,

24:44.843 --> 24:48.296
and he takes us out to dinner,

24:48.346 --> 24:49.966
orders me a steak,

24:50.016 --> 24:54.002
so I know that he sees me
as a man, not a boy,

24:54.052 --> 24:58.372
and they tell me
they're getting married.

25:00.699 --> 25:03.048
What am I supposed to say
to that'?

25:03.098 --> 25:06.317
Well, sure, I'd love a dad
who owns a shitty body shop

25:06.367 --> 25:08.619
and smells of urinal cakes.

25:08.669 --> 25:15.160
So I eat my steak,
and I go to work.

25:15.210 --> 25:16.325
Late night calls

25:16.375 --> 25:18.061
to the same number
on his cell bill.

25:18.111 --> 25:23.503
Motel room charges
on his credit card.

25:23.553 --> 25:26.067
Of course, I don'! Say a word.

25:26.117 --> 25:28.873
Let mom figure it out.

25:28.923 --> 25:31.676
And when she does,
I'm on his side.

25:31.726 --> 25:35.846
"Give him another shot,"
which she does.

25:35.896 --> 25:38.515
Until I pay a pro to show up

25:38.565 --> 25:40.250
saying he owes her 200 bucks

25:40.300 --> 25:43.155
for the abortion
he made her have.

25:45.141 --> 25:47.189
The poor bastard.

25:47.239 --> 25:50.095
He had no idea what hit him.

25:50.145 --> 25:52.728
But I knew”.

25:52.778 --> 25:57.221
I was my father's son.

25:57.222 --> 26:01.438
Sc, yeah, you're right.

26:01.488 --> 26:04.675
You're not my father.

26:04.725 --> 26:08.277
But I don't need a father.

26:08.327 --> 26:12.516
I need a partner.

26:12.566 --> 26:14.386
Your mom ever find
anybody else?

26:14.436 --> 26:16.586
What'? No.

26:16.636 --> 26:19.248
Sorry to hear that.

26:20.879 --> 26:22.924
You have no idea
what I can do for you.

26:24.177 --> 26:29.622
Ethan, stay away from me.

26:37.996 --> 26:40.744
Any fallout
from the other night?

26:40.794 --> 26:44.412
No static on this end,
no cops, no Jake,

26:44.462 --> 26:49.254
but she's been by
every night this week.

26:49.304 --> 26:52.590
I was just leaving.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.122
You're not going anywhere.

26:58.013 --> 27:00.596
I owe you an apology.

27:00.646 --> 27:03.598
Called you a freak.

27:03.648 --> 27:05.268
Sorry.

27:05.318 --> 27:08.904
Apology accepted.

27:10.325 --> 27:12.908
Well, anyway,
thanks for the other night.

27:12.958 --> 27:15.347
I've been raped before.
It's no fucking picnic.

27:15.397 --> 27:17.615
Ah, Jesus.

27:17.665 --> 27:19.085
What'?

27:19.135 --> 27:21.852
You really put it out there,
don'! You?

27:21.902 --> 27:25.353
I don't know whether
to be charmed or terrified.

27:25.403 --> 27:27.827
Come on.

27:27.877 --> 27:31.629
Be charmed'

27:34.015 --> 27:36.301
So that's it'?

27:36.351 --> 27:39.103
I buy you a bottle
of your liquor of choice,

27:39.153 --> 27:42.474
and you're not even gonna try
and get into my pants?

27:46.832 --> 27:54.716
All right, Ask me
how my day was.

27:54.766 --> 27:55.952
How was your day?

27:56.002 --> 27:57.052
Ah, shitty.

27:57.102 --> 27:59.154
How was yours?

27:59.204 --> 28:02.958
Shitty, There you go.

28:03.008 --> 28:05.229
Conversation.

28:05.279 --> 28:07.897
Sorry.
I'm a little out of practice.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.301
Well, I like a little chatter

28:09.351 --> 28:12.002
or at least a good sob story.

28:12.052 --> 28:13.872
"My wife
doesn't understand me."

28:13.922 --> 28:17.141
"You remind me
of my first girlfriend."

28:17.191 --> 28:20.546
1 don'! Have a wife.

28:20.596 --> 28:23.044
Girlfriend, then'

28:23.094 --> 28:25.207
don't have a girlfriend.

28:27.773 --> 28:29.774
I don't have a family.
I don't have a house.

28:29.775 --> 28:31.421
I don'! Have a dog,

28:31.471 --> 28:34.225
I don'! Have any friends.

28:34.275 --> 28:36.358
I don't have anything'

28:36.408 --> 28:38.520
not one goddamn thing'

28:41.887 --> 28:43.389
yeah.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.061
Me too, pretty much.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.709
Both of my parents died

28:52.759 --> 28:57.048
when I was too little
to remember them.

28:57.098 --> 29:01.786
I was raised by my alcoholic
douche bag grandma

29:01.836 --> 29:06.726
till I could get out
from under her thumb.

29:06.776 --> 29:12.227
Basically, anyone who ever
cared about me is dead.

29:12.277 --> 29:14.065
Only reason
my grandma is still alive

29:14.115 --> 29:16.564
is probably 'cause
I hate her guts.

29:19.352 --> 29:21.274
Oh, you think that's funny?

29:21.324 --> 29:23.439
Just a bit.

29:23.489 --> 29:26.244
Well,
you got something better'?

29:27.663 --> 29:31.579
I just got out of prison
last week,

29:31.629 --> 29:36.574
after 25 years
for killing my best friend.

29:36.575 --> 29:40.425
Everybody I ever cared about
is either dead,

29:40.475 --> 29:44.686
damn near dead, or
wishes I was dead.

29:48.420 --> 29:52.271
Yeah, you're definitely
more pathetic than I am.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.912
I'm seriously considering
giving you a pity fuck.

30:02.127 --> 30:07.582
Well, what if I don'! Want one?

30:07.632 --> 30:09.608
In case you've been
hit in the head too many times,

30:09.609 --> 30:12.620
I'll be real clear.

30:12.670 --> 30:15.056
This is your big chance'

30:35.233 --> 30:38.180
I'll tell you when it's time
for you to do something.

31:01.693 --> 31:05.273
All right, you can kiss me now.

32:02.988 --> 32:05.594
Got a matching set on this one.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.409
Tried to kill myself.

32:11.459 --> 32:13.432
Couple of times.

32:15.500 --> 32:19.148
That upset you?

32:19.198 --> 32:20.817
No.

32:20.867 --> 32:23.384
Just glad
you didn't pull it off.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.063
I'm a drug addict.

32:33.113 --> 32:36.463
That upset you?

32:41.326 --> 32:43.439
I'm a murderer.

32:43.489 --> 32:46.412
Does that upset you?

32:46.462 --> 32:50.681
I can't remember the last time
I did something I was proud of.

32:50.731 --> 32:52.704
I know what you mean.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.625
You do, actually.

33:00.675 --> 33:03.528
You understand.

33:03.578 --> 33:06.195
Nothing changes
unless you make it change.

33:07.379 --> 33:10.533
Yeah, I know how that sounds.

33:10.583 --> 33:14.058
Every morning,
when I woke up in prison,

33:14.059 --> 33:18.376
I thought about
what it really meant.

33:18.426 --> 33:21.375
Listen“.

33:21.425 --> 33:24.648
I got to go to the bathroom.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.551
Take some stuff.

33:26.601 --> 33:31.186
Else I'll be climbing
the walls.

33:31.236 --> 33:35.327
You can leave if you
want, I'll understand,

33:35.377 --> 33:36.690
he?

33:45.350 --> 33:47.530
You don't have to close
the door.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.936
Hi.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.159
How many of these places
have you ever been to?

35:18.209 --> 35:22.101
Oh, you know none.

35:22.151 --> 35:23.120
None?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.622
I buy them at used bookstores.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.804
I read about places
that I could never afford to go,

35:27.854 --> 35:30.506
plan out trips
I could never afford to take.

35:30.556 --> 35:32.674
So if you could go
to any of these places, which...

35:32.724 --> 35:35.277
Brazil.

35:35.327 --> 35:38.847
Definitely.

35:38.897 --> 35:40.448
I'd fly to Rio,

35:40.498 --> 35:43.451
then head 1,000 miles
up the coast to maceio,

35:43.501 --> 35:45.887
so I could see...

35:49.180 --> 35:54.964
This, Why Rio?

35:55.014 --> 35:56.488
Guess it seems
like the kind of place

35:56.489 --> 35:59.269
you could just lose yourself.

36:01.087 --> 36:03.171
You're doing okay.

36:03.221 --> 36:04.975
I had concerns.

36:05.025 --> 36:06.839
Yeah, me too'

36:08.967 --> 36:11.113
I want you to move in,

36:24.382 --> 36:26.555
welcome home.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.522
Smells good in here,

36:33.425 --> 36:37.371
what's the matter? Hmm?

36:37.421 --> 36:42.376
I feel like this is-
this is real,

36:42.426 --> 36:45.351
like we're making a life here.

36:45.401 --> 36:48.152
We are.

36:48.202 --> 36:51.056
Okay.

36:51.106 --> 36:53.025
Then there's some shit
we need to clear up.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.767
Mm.

37:02.817 --> 37:04.236
That night at the Apollo lounge

37:04.286 --> 37:07.071
"with that guy."

37:07.121 --> 37:11.876
It wasn't just a coincidence
you showed up, was it?

37:11.926 --> 37:14.543
What are you talking about'?

37:14.593 --> 37:17.069
Well, Ethan sent you right?

37:20.105 --> 37:23.185
You've known this whole time?

37:23.235 --> 37:26.052
Sort of figured, yeah.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.902
I owe him money.

37:39.952 --> 37:42.774
More than I can pay.

37:42.824 --> 37:46.543
He said if I slept with you,
we'd be square.

37:46.593 --> 37:48.913
Had to do it before.

37:48.963 --> 37:51.316
Not a lot.

37:51.366 --> 37:53.549
Two times.

37:53.599 --> 37:54.606
I don't care about that.

37:54.607 --> 37:55.949
I do.

37:58.910 --> 38:02.423
I told him I'd check you out
and decide.

38:02.473 --> 38:05.763
Guess I was pretending
like I had a choice.

38:05.813 --> 38:07.430
Jake decided
I was just some whore

38:07.480 --> 38:10.431
and he can get a freebie.

38:10.481 --> 38:12.303
I remember laying on
that bathroom floor,

38:12.353 --> 38:16.135
thinking,
"this could be it for me."

38:18.463 --> 38:23.281
On my knees,
in front of some son of a bitch.

38:23.331 --> 38:27.185
Then you walked in.

38:28.732 --> 38:30.020
After you took off,

38:30.070 --> 38:32.924
I told Ethan
I'd find a way to pay him back,

38:32.974 --> 38:36.289
but I wasn't doing
what he wanted.

38:39.284 --> 38:44.467
I went to that bar
because of him,

38:44.517 --> 38:48.874
but everything since
has been because of you,

38:56.534 --> 38:58.343
Okay.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.485
I just wanted the truth.

39:19.424 --> 39:21.739
I'm sorry.

39:21.789 --> 39:24.372
Promise me
you'll never lie to me again.

39:24.422 --> 39:27.076
I promise you the same.

39:27.126 --> 39:30.414
I promise, and I'm sorry.

39:30.464 --> 39:32.437
Don't be.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.728
3602.

39:49.954 --> 39:52.202
Hey, come on in.

39:52.252 --> 39:53.725
Listen, you want a drink?
I got some...

39:53.726 --> 39:56.203
I'm here to talk business.

39:56.253 --> 39:57.541
Okay.

39:57.591 --> 39:59.073
So you're finally ready
to be partners.

39:59.123 --> 40:00.242
That's good news.

40:00.292 --> 40:01.877
No, no, no, no.
See, you misunderstand.

40:01.927 --> 40:03.613
You and me, we're never gonna
work together.

40:03.663 --> 40:04.780
Never say never.

40:04.830 --> 40:06.803
I'm here about iris.

40:06.804 --> 40:10.120
I know what's been going on.

40:10.170 --> 40:11.854
You do, eh?

40:11.904 --> 40:14.956
Yeah.

40:15.006 --> 40:16.929
I don't know, foley.

40:16.979 --> 40:21.698
You know, I've been
watching you real close,

40:21.748 --> 40:24.698
and I don't think
you know shit.

40:26.187 --> 40:31.042
In fact, I think
you're totally fucking clueless.

40:32.325 --> 40:35.045
You remember Jake, right?

40:35.095 --> 40:37.602
Yeah, he sure remembers you,

40:45.176 --> 40:48.127
Sorry about that,

40:48.177 --> 40:52.497
but Jake was kind of pissed
at you.

40:52.547 --> 40:58.967
So... Right about now,

40:59.017 --> 41:04.775
Jake is sitting in a car
outside of iris' apartment,

41:04.825 --> 41:06.942
and if I don't call him
in ten minutes,

41:06.992 --> 41:09.443
he's gonna go upstairs,
fuck her,

41:09.493 --> 41:12.817
and cave her head in
with a bat.

41:12.867 --> 41:15.511
Or maybe he'll cave her head in
and then fuck her.

41:18.376 --> 41:20.190
You think I'm gonna-what?

41:20.240 --> 41:23.628
Forgive you for killing my dad?

41:25.344 --> 41:28.131
You owe me, foley,

41:28.181 --> 41:31.622
and I know exactly how
you're gonna pay your debt.

41:34.625 --> 41:38.706
You're gonna make me
$8 million.

41:38.756 --> 41:40.876
$8 million is the price
of the bullet

41:40.926 --> 41:42.814
you put
in your best friend's head

41:42.864 --> 41:45.149
to save your sorry ass.

41:45.199 --> 41:46.204
Ethan, listen to me...

41:46.205 --> 41:49.987
No, you listen to me!

41:50.037 --> 41:57.826
I have got a mark
primed and ready to go,

41:57.876 --> 42:00.962
but he does things old-school,

42:01.012 --> 42:04.999
so I need someone old-school
to help me take his money.

42:05.049 --> 42:06.067
You don't want my help.

42:06.117 --> 42:07.668
You want to get me back
for what I did.

42:07.718 --> 42:09.694
No, this is about
what you're going to do,

42:09.695 --> 42:11.840
which is exactly what I say,

42:11.890 --> 42:15.376
or I make sure that iris
finds out something about you

42:15.426 --> 42:21.185
that she really, really
doesn't want to know.

42:22.968 --> 42:24.856
Look, me and iris
already told each other

42:24.906 --> 42:27.225
every fucked-up thing
we've ever done in our lives.

42:27.275 --> 42:29.723
You can't get me like that.
We have no secrets.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.133
Got to know a secret
to tell a secret.

42:53.264 --> 42:55.052
Your old girlfriend,
Tess Armstrong,

42:55.102 --> 42:59.053
told you that she had her
little problem taken care of,

42:59.103 --> 43:02.894
she kept it.

43:02.944 --> 43:04.627
I have a kid?

43:07.678 --> 43:10.366
You got too used
to thinking small,

43:10.416 --> 43:14.401
stuck inside that shitty little
prison cell all those years.

43:14.451 --> 43:16.470
And now, inside
that shitty little apartment

43:16.520 --> 43:20.609
where the two of you
have been playing house.

43:20.659 --> 43:22.804
Except you're the one
who's been played.

43:31.509 --> 43:33.011
She's your daughter.

43:36.581 --> 43:41.599
Iris... "Is."

43:41.649 --> 43:43.664
Your... No, no.

43:43.714 --> 43:44.766
Daughter.

43:44.816 --> 43:47.436
No, no.

43:47.486 --> 43:49.960
Your precious, little
baby girl.

43:51.893 --> 43:53.244
I should shoot you right now

43:53.294 --> 43:54.808
for even saying
some shit like that to me.

43:54.858 --> 43:55.910
She's your daughter.

43:55.960 --> 43:56.968
That's a lie!

43:58.495 --> 44:00.013
The night you met iris,

44:00.063 --> 44:01.953
face-to-face
with your own flesh and blood

44:02.003 --> 44:03.974
you had no clue.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.256
No clue.

44:06.306 --> 44:09.526
It was priceless.

44:09.576 --> 44:11.795
You gonna kill me, foley?

44:11.845 --> 44:13.630
Huh? Then what'?

44:13.680 --> 44:17.366
How long do you think it'll take
the cops to figure it out'?

44:17.416 --> 44:21.234
No, you're gonna do
whatever I say.

44:22.827 --> 44:25.142
You know all iris' secrets,
huh?

44:25.192 --> 44:29.143
So you know that she's had some
close calls with a razor blade.

44:29.193 --> 44:32.117
You know, I wonder
how it'll make her feel,

44:32.167 --> 44:34.018
knowing all this time
she's been fucking her...

44:36.040 --> 44:37.618
Fuck!

44:39.506 --> 44:42.822
That is the last time
you do that.

44:45.550 --> 44:48.866
You know, I almost
feel sorry for you.

44:48.916 --> 44:53.968
After all these years of putting
the frame on your marks,

44:54.018 --> 44:55.993
now who's the mark'?

44:59.030 --> 45:02.910
You got about six minutes
to make up your mind.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.367
Call him.

45:25.417 --> 45:27.733
Excellent decision.

45:37.463 --> 45:38.436
- Shit.
- What?

45:38.437 --> 45:39.784
Nothing. He just...

45:39.834 --> 45:41.050
He's not answering his phone.

45:41.100 --> 45:43.887
Give me your car keys.

45:43.937 --> 45:49.394
If he's touched
her, kill yourself.

46:27.981 --> 46:29.429
Hey, bitch-cakes.

46:29.479 --> 46:31.599
You miss me?

46:37.323 --> 46:38.474
. No!

46:45.130 --> 46:46.450
See that'!

46:46.500 --> 46:48.515
That's from foley.
Eye for an eye'

47:13.225 --> 47:14.196
You all right'?

47:14.197 --> 47:15.444
It's all right. It's all right.

47:15.494 --> 47:17.146
Okay orgy.

47:17.196 --> 47:18.482
All right, all right,
all right,

47:18.532 --> 47:20.502
look, I have to get him
out of here,

47:20.503 --> 47:22.049
then I'm probably
gonna have to lay low

47:22.099 --> 47:23.319
in case there's heat, okay?

47:23.369 --> 47:24.818
You mean we're gonna
have to lay low...

47:24.868 --> 47:26.055
You and me, together.

47:26.105 --> 47:28.724
No, no, it's smarter
if we slay apart.

47:28.774 --> 47:30.060
What happened with Ethan?

47:30.110 --> 47:31.693
- I took care of it.
- What does that mean?

47:31.743 --> 47:32.861
It means I took care of it!

47:32.911 --> 47:36.166
You don't have to deal with him
anymore!

47:36.216 --> 47:39.233
- What's going on?
- Nothing!

47:39.283 --> 47:43.804
Look, iris, I cannot
go back to prison.

47:43.854 --> 47:46.340
I have to get him out of here
before the police come.

47:46.390 --> 47:49.376
Don't say anything to anyone'

47:49.426 --> 47:51.316
I don'! Have anybody to tell.

47:51.366 --> 47:53.872
You're the person
I tell everything.

47:58.909 --> 48:00.217
Come on, piece of...

48:08.111 --> 48:10.434
Xavier's gonna fucking end you.

48:10.484 --> 48:11.558
Hey!

48:13.057 --> 48:15.704
These are for the guy in 3602.

48:15.754 --> 48:17.603
His car's in the usual spot.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.402
Celia?

48:45.452 --> 48:46.800
You're out.

48:51.896 --> 48:54.278
You look the same.

48:54.328 --> 48:55.944
Older, but the same.

48:55.994 --> 49:00.283
Celia, do I have a daughter'?

49:00.333 --> 49:01.647
How did you find out'?

49:09.947 --> 49:11.593
You were in prison a long time.

49:11.643 --> 49:13.458
Tess wanted to be rid of you.

49:17.588 --> 49:21.263
When she passed,
I respected her decision.

49:22.993 --> 49:27.777
So what did Tess tell the kid
about who her father was?

49:27.827 --> 49:30.300
Said he died in a car crash.

49:30.301 --> 49:33.347
By that time, Tess was sick.

49:33.397 --> 49:34.752
Kids don't question things

49:34.802 --> 49:37.776
when their whole world
is falling apart.

49:41.512 --> 49:46.483
Look, foley,
you're better dead to her.

49:46.484 --> 49:48.130
Yeah,
I know that's hard to hear,

49:48.180 --> 49:51.834
but she's got a life now.

49:51.884 --> 49:53.136
She doesn't need to know

49:53.186 --> 49:56.001
the kind of people
she came from,

50:02.566 --> 50:04.212
could you tell me her name?

50:04.262 --> 50:05.813
I'm not gonna go look for her
or anything.

50:05.863 --> 50:08.407
I just want to know.

50:10.007 --> 50:12.322
Iris.

50:12.372 --> 50:16.660
Her name is iris.

50:16.710 --> 50:18.393
Thanks, Celia.

50:59.884 --> 51:01.368
What are you doing?
Get out of my house!

51:01.418 --> 51:02.706
What did you tell Ethan
about me?

51:02.756 --> 51:04.040
What?

51:04.090 --> 51:05.909
Who do you think did that
to me?

51:07.929 --> 51:10.781
Jesus, foley,
what did he do to you?

51:12.097 --> 51:15.020
I'm sorry.

51:24.481 --> 51:27.263
J'-I'

51:54.111 --> 51:56.926
You disappear for a week.

51:56.976 --> 51:59.161
Not a fucking word to
let me know you're even alive,

51:59.211 --> 52:01.762
but you're sorry?

52:01.812 --> 52:04.297
I spent half my life in prison.

52:04.347 --> 52:08.003
In there, the decisions
are made for you.

52:08.053 --> 52:09.026
All this out here?

52:09.027 --> 52:10.407
It's new to me.

52:10.457 --> 52:12.241
I got things to sort out.

52:12.291 --> 52:14.611
And in order to do that,
I need time.

52:14.661 --> 52:18.348
Time... Time
away from all this.

52:18.398 --> 52:22.507
Time... Away from you'

52:24.975 --> 52:27.588
you're lying.

52:27.638 --> 52:28.655
We said no lies.

52:28.705 --> 52:31.291
Iris I know when you're lying'

52:31.341 --> 52:33.028
so you might as well
just tell me the truth.

52:33.078 --> 52:37.632
That is the truth.
You have to trust me.

52:37.682 --> 52:41.539
Look, we can't see each other
right now.

52:41.589 --> 52:43.704
It'd be best if you left

52:43.754 --> 52:46.706
I can'! Tell you why.

52:48.026 --> 52:50.977
Look, if I didn't have to,
I wouldn't ask.

52:51.027 --> 52:52.281
You want me to trust you,

52:52.331 --> 52:54.016
but you won't even trust me
with the truth?

52:54.066 --> 52:55.886
If I told you
it was for your own protection,

52:55.936 --> 52:57.908
you would just tell me
you could protect yourself.

52:57.909 --> 52:59.222
- I can.
- I know.

52:59.272 --> 53:04.061
And I know you can see through
any story I tell you.

53:04.111 --> 53:05.895
You're supposed to be
the one person

53:05.945 --> 53:09.090
I can always tell the truth'

53:11.855 --> 53:14.367
but I can't.

53:14.417 --> 53:15.893
And I'm asking you again...

53:15.894 --> 53:19.033
Please, trust me.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.047
Let's just get out of here'

53:23.097 --> 53:24.313
we'll go somewhere hot,

53:24.363 --> 53:27.347
with beaches
and fat tourists to rip off.

53:27.397 --> 53:31.188
I'll plan every detail.

53:31.238 --> 53:34.677
All you have to do is say yes,

53:34.678 --> 53:36.179
I have money I can give you,

53:36.180 --> 53:39.159
just take it
and go as far away as you can.

53:39.209 --> 53:43.067
Don'! Tell me where.

53:43.117 --> 53:44.867
How long'?

53:44.917 --> 53:48.858
A few weeks. A month, maybe.

53:48.859 --> 53:51.674
Or longer?

53:51.724 --> 53:53.611
Or never'?

53:53.661 --> 53:56.076
No, no, baby, not never.

54:00.933 --> 54:02.281
Iris.

54:15.512 --> 54:17.112
J'-I'

54:33.937 --> 54:35.251
look, I need your help.

54:35.301 --> 54:37.086
Got myself in a bit of trouble'

54:37.136 --> 54:38.609
I mean, nothing of my doing

54:38.610 --> 54:41.121
but something I can'! Shake.

54:41.171 --> 54:42.791
What are we talking about here?

54:42.841 --> 54:44.925
Local guy,
moves a lot of product.

54:44.975 --> 54:47.595
Could be a big catch.

54:47.645 --> 54:49.331
You want to go informer'?

54:49.381 --> 54:52.332
You're my parole officer,
right?

54:52.382 --> 54:54.529
Isn't this
what I'm supposed to do'?

55:09.169 --> 55:10.173
It's Deacon.

55:10.174 --> 55:13.124
You got him?

55:13.174 --> 55:15.487
Yeah, he's right here'

55:20.651 --> 55:22.032
yeah?

55:22.082 --> 55:23.799
You don'! Have to be
a criminal mastermind

55:23.849 --> 55:25.135
to pay some guy off.

55:25.185 --> 55:27.156
You made your one mistake,
foley.

55:27.157 --> 55:30.108
You make any more,
and you're dons.

55:30.158 --> 55:31.874
I want my answer by tonight.

55:51.481 --> 55:53.154
Going lip'...

56:06.230 --> 56:07.808
20.

56:07.858 --> 56:09.511
19.

56:09.561 --> 56:10.745
14.

56:10.795 --> 56:12.312
13.

56:12.362 --> 56:13.751
12.

56:13.801 --> 56:15.315
11.

56:15.365 --> 56:16.720
10.

56:16.770 --> 56:19.655
9... Congratulations.

56:19.705 --> 56:21.688
The good news?

56:21.738 --> 56:25.524
You have a very good
circulatory system,

56:28.385 --> 56:30.396
the bad news is,

56:30.446 --> 56:34.068
I learned some
pretty nasty things in prison.

56:34.118 --> 56:36.237
Did you know a small knife

56:36.287 --> 56:39.639
can cause just as much damage
as a big knife?

56:43.400 --> 56:46.215
Take this one, for instance.

56:46.265 --> 56:48.883
I use it to cut fruit.

56:48.933 --> 56:53.623
But if I press it here

56:53.673 --> 56:57.224
and make a cut
about an inch long,

56:57.274 --> 56:59.095
you'll bleed to death

56:59.145 --> 57:00.531
in almost two minutes.

57:00.581 --> 57:02.797
Listen, foley... No, you listen.

57:02.847 --> 57:04.397
If we're gonna pull this grift
together,

57:04.447 --> 57:06.101
you're gonna have to promise me
two things.

57:06.151 --> 57:07.769
Fuck you, foley.
You're not in control.

57:07.819 --> 57:10.039
Don'! You get it'!

57:15.933 --> 57:18.411
These are my conditions.

57:18.461 --> 57:25.587
First, iris will never hear
a whisper of what you told me.

57:25.637 --> 57:30.157
If you so much as hint at it,
I will kill you.

57:30.207 --> 57:31.792
- You understand?
- Yes.

57:31.842 --> 57:33.461
Secondly, if we pull this con,

57:33.511 --> 57:37.334
you will follow my instructions
to the smallest detail,

57:37.384 --> 57:38.831
no exceptions.

57:38.881 --> 57:41.271
- You got it?
- Yes.

57:41.321 --> 57:42.937
You know,
you don't sound too convincing.

57:42.987 --> 57:44.606
Yes! I-yes, I understand.

57:44.656 --> 57:46.240
Absolutely! Fuck!

57:47.391 --> 57:49.475
Okay.

57:49.525 --> 57:51.843
- Come on.
- Fuck!

57:54.698 --> 57:56.671
We need to worry about
being disturbed?

57:56.672 --> 57:57.751
No, no, we're fine.

57:57.801 --> 57:59.588
The clinic closed at 7:00,

57:59.638 --> 58:00.923
and I'm here through the night

58:00.973 --> 58:03.827
to make sure the junkies don't-
don't break in.

58:03.877 --> 58:06.027
Are you even a fucking doctor'?

58:06.077 --> 58:08.297
Am I getting stitched up
by a fucking janitor'?

58:08.347 --> 58:10.268
In Serbia, I was a surgeon.

58:10.318 --> 58:11.831
Here, I'm a night watchman'

58:11.881 --> 58:13.203
miro knows what he's doing.

58:13.253 --> 58:15.225
Fixed me up plenty of times
in prison.

58:15.226 --> 58:18.176
Look, you saved my ass
a hundred limes.

58:18.226 --> 58:19.273
This is nothing. I owe you.

58:19.323 --> 58:20.644
Enough with
fucking memory Lane!

58:20.694 --> 58:25.044
Just... Just fucking finish.

58:26.403 --> 58:28.785
I've made preparations, foley.

58:28.835 --> 58:31.655
I get taken out,
two things happen'

58:31.705 --> 58:35.188
cops find Jake
with your DNA all over him,

58:35.238 --> 58:39.394
and iris finds out
about her long-lost daddy.

58:39.444 --> 58:42.488
And wherever you've got her
stashed, she can be found.

58:50.193 --> 58:52.075
Here's what I need:

58:52.125 --> 58:54.643
A high-end hotel room
so I can get in shape

58:54.693 --> 58:58.081
and work out
the details of the grift.

58:58.131 --> 59:01.018
I need a woman
to play the catch.

59:01.068 --> 59:04.753
Preferably older, experienced.

59:04.803 --> 59:06.021
I need an I.T. Guy

59:06.071 --> 59:07.924
who can open
international accounts

59:07.974 --> 59:09.826
and walk me through the tech.

59:09.876 --> 59:13.349
And I need a place to stage
the actual grift,

59:13.350 --> 59:14.996
preferably a house...

59:15.046 --> 59:18.767
Big, expensive, isolated.

59:18.817 --> 59:20.603
Yes. You see?

59:20.653 --> 59:23.372
This is exactly
what I'm talking about, partner'

59:23.422 --> 59:25.539
we're not partners, Ethan.

59:25.589 --> 59:29.031
I had a partner once'

59:29.032 --> 59:31.077
I killed him.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:48.488
Looking good, foley.

01:00:48.538 --> 01:00:51.462
Let me introduce you
to your wife, Helena.

01:00:51.512 --> 01:00:53.796
Helena, this is your husband.

01:00:53.846 --> 01:00:56.767
Latest husband, anyway.

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.706
So you know
how this grift works?

01:01:04.756 --> 01:01:07.144
Yeah, first half, anyway.

01:01:07.194 --> 01:01:08.641
Ethan's the inside man.

01:01:08.691 --> 01:01:09.709
You're the outside man.

01:01:09.759 --> 01:01:10.979
I'm the catch...

01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:12.781
Coked-up wife of some rich guy,

01:01:12.831 --> 01:01:14.150
real estate developer'

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.172
right.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.820
So long work's already done'

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:21.989
six months ago, someone stole
some money from the mark.

01:01:22.039 --> 01:01:23.624
250 grand.

01:01:23.674 --> 01:01:27.126
And that someone
is no longer with us'

01:01:27.176 --> 01:01:30.967
Me.

01:01:31.017 --> 01:01:32.987
So I tell the mark,
"hey, you remember"

01:01:32.988 --> 01:01:34.803
that dumb motherfucker
who ripped you off'...

01:01:34.853 --> 01:01:37.471
Let her tell it.

01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:39.038
Ethan takes me to the mark,

01:01:39.088 --> 01:01:42.074
I say, "it's not my fault,
wasn't my idea."

01:01:42.124 --> 01:01:44.413
250 got stolen in a drug deal.

01:01:44.463 --> 01:01:47.081
Mark wants his money now,

01:01:47.131 --> 01:01:49.605
but I've only go!
One way to pay it:

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:51.319
My rich husband.

01:01:51.369 --> 01:01:52.689
You.

01:01:52.739 --> 01:01:53.753
. See?

01:01:53.803 --> 01:01:55.192
I told you she's a pro.

01:01:55.242 --> 01:01:57.060
She knows her part.

01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:59.082
I know my part,
but who's the mark'?

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:12.441
Are you out of your mind?

01:02:12.491 --> 01:02:14.608
You never said we were
pulling this on Xavier.

01:02:14.658 --> 01:02:17.047
Yeah, what are you gonna do
about it, bitch?

01:02:17.097 --> 01:02:21.918
Are you suddenly in a position
where you can just walk away?

01:02:21.968 --> 01:02:24.951
Hey. Don't disrespect her.

01:02:25.001 --> 01:02:26.187
When we're on the grift,

01:02:26.237 --> 01:02:28.254
our lives
are in each other's hands.

01:02:28.304 --> 01:02:33.292
Or do I need to remind you
about the promise you made?

01:02:33.342 --> 01:02:34.731
Apologies.

01:02:34.781 --> 01:02:38.067
Are you absolutely positive-
I mean, 100% sure...

01:02:38.117 --> 01:02:39.734
This money can't be traced?

01:02:39.784 --> 01:02:41.070
Twice a year, Xavier flies in

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.405
to make sure that his money

01:02:42.455 --> 01:02:45.072
is laundered and dispersed
to clean accounts.

01:02:45.122 --> 01:02:46.443
He always does it in person.

01:02:46.493 --> 01:02:48.109
But he's such a greedy prick

01:02:48.159 --> 01:02:50.277
that if he finds out that
he can make an extra percentage

01:02:50.327 --> 01:02:51.411
by fucking someone over,

01:02:51.461 --> 01:02:53.778
I guarantee you, he will do it.

01:02:56.606 --> 01:03:00.755
The grift is not about
taking someone's money.

01:03:00.805 --> 01:03:03.424
It's about gaining
their confidence.

01:03:03.474 --> 01:03:06.059
The key is to set up
a situation

01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:09.095
where even though the mark knows
he's fucking me over,

01:03:09.145 --> 01:03:12.334
he gets to act
like he's doing me a favor,

01:03:12.384 --> 01:03:14.335
like he's running the grift.

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:19.803
That's why it's called
the samaritan.

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:30.117
Yeah?

01:03:30.167 --> 01:03:32.120
It's Helena.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:55.609
Um, I just wanted
to thank you for, um...

01:03:55.659 --> 01:03:59.111
Well, I guess for not being
a son of a bitch.

01:03:59.161 --> 01:04:01.172
It's nothing.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.143
Got anything to drink in here?

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:15.223
Ethan send you?

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:21.360
Fuck you. I'm not a whore'

01:04:24.728 --> 01:04:26.475
I'm sorry.

01:04:26.525 --> 01:04:30.813
I'm here
because I like the look of you.

01:04:30.863 --> 01:04:35.584
And like you said,
if this thing falls apart,

01:04:35.634 --> 01:04:37.448
we end up dead.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.557
This is not part of the grift.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:05:00.708
What do you want, Helena?

01:05:00.758 --> 01:05:02.112
I know who Ethan is,

01:05:02.162 --> 01:05:05.279
but I don'! Know who you are
or why you're here.

01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:06.879
I was gonna do it
the old-fashioned way

01:05:06.929 --> 01:05:09.117
and ball it out of you,
but you got all...

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:10.284
Professional,

01:05:10.334 --> 01:05:13.920
so now I just got to
come out and ask.

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:16.359
It's unbecoming.

01:05:21.078 --> 01:05:24.553
So Ethan's got you loo?

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:26.397
Hook's in deep.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:31.637
You really think
if we pull this off,

01:05:31.687 --> 01:05:35.579
he'll just pay us off
and cut us loose?

01:05:35.629 --> 01:05:37.669
I don't know.

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:44.785
I think he'll just keep
coming back and...

01:05:44.835 --> 01:05:47.618
Taking and taking and taking,

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:01.323
we'll get through this.

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:03.827
Ain't no "we," foley.

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:09.975
Thinking any different
will just get you dead.

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:18.119
Does this look like
the kind of place

01:06:18.169 --> 01:06:19.753
that a slick-ass
real estate developer

01:06:19.803 --> 01:06:21.320
would build for himself'?

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:22.590
How far is this from the club?

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.791
17 minutes.

01:06:23.841 --> 01:06:25.127
Exactly 17 minutes?

01:06:25.177 --> 01:06:26.760
Trust me, I timed it.

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:28.260
And before you say anything,

01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:31.787
I fucking drove
at the right time of night,

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:35.668
we got 12 hours left
for any final details.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.609
You absolutely sure

01:06:38.659 --> 01:06:40.639
Xavier is gonna drive
all the way out here himself'!

01:06:40.689 --> 01:06:42.164
I know him.

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:43.209
He's got a hard-on

01:06:43.259 --> 01:06:45.345
for showing me
how to do things right.

01:06:45.395 --> 01:06:47.318
If I knock Helena around
too hard,

01:06:47.368 --> 01:06:49.382
he'll step in and take control
of the situation'

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:10.726
Hey, come on in.

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:13.374
We're gonna be late
picking up Helena.

01:07:13.424 --> 01:07:15.644
What's up, you got one
of your club bitches up in here?

01:07:15.694 --> 01:07:18.644
Boy, that's why
I wanted to see you first.

01:07:18.694 --> 01:07:21.518
Get you motivated
for the big show.

01:07:21.568 --> 01:07:23.779
Come on down and say hi.

01:07:30.206 --> 01:07:31.624
Hi.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.499
Thought you got rid of me, huh?

01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:42.203
Couldn't figure out
why you were lying.

01:07:42.253 --> 01:07:44.770
Just had to find out why.

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:48.375
But I never thought
you'd blow me off for money.

01:07:48.425 --> 01:07:50.044
I don't know
what you think you're doing...

01:07:50.094 --> 01:07:52.881
You don'! Get to tell me
what to do anymore,

01:07:52.931 --> 01:07:54.716
I cleaned up.

01:07:54.766 --> 01:07:56.248
I started to kick.

01:07:56.298 --> 01:07:58.784
I did everything right.

01:07:58.834 --> 01:08:00.223
But you just wanted me
out of the way

01:08:00.273 --> 01:08:02.592
so you'd get right back
to the grift.

01:08:02.642 --> 01:08:04.614
You're the real addict here,
foley.

01:08:04.615 --> 01:08:06.260
Not me.

01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:07.731
I need to talk to you alone.

01:08:07.781 --> 01:08:09.064
Anything you need to say to me,

01:08:09.114 --> 01:08:13.402
you can say in front of him.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:22.144
Good luck tonight.

01:08:22.194 --> 01:08:24.441
Come home rich.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.013
You ready to go to work?

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:42.828
You know, I got no choice here.

01:08:42.877 --> 01:08:43.895
She's my leverage

01:08:43.946 --> 01:08:45.234
in case you're thinking
of making

01:08:45.283 --> 01:08:47.426
some last-minute changes
to the plan.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.607
You're running the angles, eh?

01:08:51.657 --> 01:08:53.774
Trying to figure out
how to get her away from me.

01:08:53.823 --> 01:08:54.941
But then what?

01:08:54.991 --> 01:08:55.999
Then what do you do?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.475
You slay with her?

01:08:57.526 --> 01:08:59.078
Maybe you guys
should just be friends.

01:08:59.127 --> 01:09:02.019
Ethan. Stop talking.

01:09:15.549 --> 01:09:16.895
Helena!

01:09:21.024 --> 01:09:23.339
Helena, you better be ready.

01:09:31.694 --> 01:09:33.841
Messy bitch.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.527
Fucking bitch!

01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:00.674
You know, she probably
fucking planned this all along,

01:10:00.724 --> 01:10:03.676
just waiting for
the right moment to fuck me!

01:10:03.726 --> 01:10:05.480
Fuck!

01:10:07.934 --> 01:10:09.381
A woman is dead, Ethan,

01:10:09.431 --> 01:10:12.356
yeah, and I'm gonna have
a fucking big, long cry over it

01:10:12.406 --> 01:10:15.387
once you tell me
how to fix this!

01:10:15.437 --> 01:10:17.557
Well, we're not going
to fix it.

01:10:17.607 --> 01:10:19.530
This is a three-person grift.

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.550
Husband, wife, dealer.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.899
Everything pivots on the catch.

01:10:22.949 --> 01:10:25.200
No catch, no grift.

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:28.200
The mark arrives
in about three hours.

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:29.504
We're out of time.

01:10:29.554 --> 01:10:31.339
You got to know someone
from back in the day.

01:10:31.389 --> 01:10:32.393
I could call Gretchen,

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:34.041
but that finger
you chopped off her hand

01:10:34.091 --> 01:10:35.242
might give away the fact

01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:36.842
that she's not the coked-up
trophy wife

01:10:36.892 --> 01:10:37.876
of a real estate developer.

01:10:37.926 --> 01:10:39.079
Fuck you!

01:10:39.129 --> 01:10:40.916
You've done a pretty good job
of that already'

01:10:40.966 --> 01:10:41.947
fucking yourself too.

01:10:52.115 --> 01:10:53.429
No.

01:10:53.479 --> 01:10:54.594
We need the catch.

01:10:54.644 --> 01:10:56.465
No goddamn way.

01:10:56.515 --> 01:10:57.800
What? She's not smart enough'?

01:10:57.850 --> 01:10:59.398
Pretty enough? Quick enough?

01:10:59.448 --> 01:11:00.803
What's missing
that Helena had'?

01:11:00.853 --> 01:11:01.901
Not gonna happen.

01:11:01.951 --> 01:11:05.738
Not your call, do I
have a choice here?

01:11:05.788 --> 01:11:08.240
Or am I just supposed to go
whichever way the wind blows?

01:11:08.290 --> 01:11:10.911
Yes,
of course you have a choice.

01:11:10.961 --> 01:11:13.580
Split's 60/20/20.

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:17.116
That's $1.6 million for you.
What do you say?

01:11:17.166 --> 01:11:19.320
- Yeah.
- It'll never work.

01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:22.157
You know I can do it.

01:11:22.207 --> 01:11:25.759
Or is it that I'd be
playing your wife?

01:11:25.809 --> 01:11:26.927
Fair enough.

01:11:26.977 --> 01:11:28.460
The mark would have to be
pretty stupid

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:30.485
to buy me as your wife,

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:33.126
but I could be your daughter,

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:39.306
the grift
calls for a cokehead wife

01:11:39.356 --> 01:11:42.279
getting dirty behind
her husband's back, right?

01:11:42.329 --> 01:11:44.180
But it could just as easily
be a wayward daughter

01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:45.649
stuffing daddy's money
up her nose,

01:11:45.699 --> 01:11:47.083
she's right.

01:11:47.133 --> 01:11:49.485
Look, it's not
that you're not pretty enough,

01:11:49.535 --> 01:11:51.117
quick enough, or smart enough'

01:11:51.167 --> 01:11:52.786
it's just that
you're not ready,

01:11:52.836 --> 01:11:54.455
and we don't have time
to get you ready.

01:11:54.505 --> 01:11:56.623
You don't know the turns.
You don'! Know the backups.

01:11:56.673 --> 01:11:57.791
You don't know the gear'

01:11:57.841 --> 01:11:59.460
make a mistake,
you can get all of us killed.

01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:00.796
You know,
there are things worse

01:12:00.846 --> 01:12:01.962
than getting killed, foley.

01:12:02.012 --> 01:12:03.129
I think you know that.

01:12:03.179 --> 01:12:04.798
How much do you owe?

01:12:04.848 --> 01:12:05.966
What'?

01:12:06.016 --> 01:12:08.303
I want to know
how deep you're in this

01:12:08.353 --> 01:12:11.275
that you're so willing
to commit suicide to get out.

01:12:11.325 --> 01:12:14.975
Like your dad.

01:12:15.025 --> 01:12:16.999
We can pull this off.

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:23.848
Ifs over.

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:30.290
I need this.

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:34.062
I can take my cut,
getaway from here-far away.

01:12:34.112 --> 01:12:36.730
Don't you think I deserve that?

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.032
Come with me.

01:12:38.082 --> 01:12:39.666
You know what, foley?
You want out?

01:12:39.716 --> 01:12:41.571
Fine. Get the fuck out.

01:12:41.621 --> 01:12:43.472
She stays.

01:12:43.522 --> 01:12:45.672
Leave with me, right now.

01:12:45.722 --> 01:12:46.739
Don'! Listen to him.

01:12:46.789 --> 01:12:48.076
No, don't listen to me.

01:12:48.126 --> 01:12:50.441
I'm only trying
to make us all fucking rich!

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.213
I'm staying.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:22.711
Everything I touch
turns to shit.

01:13:22.761 --> 01:13:25.144
Why do you think that is?

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:31.745
Jesus.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.454
I found him.

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.130
Yeah?

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.229
Daddy?

01:13:43.279 --> 01:13:44.397
Help me.

01:13:46.284 --> 01:13:47.569
What did you do, huh?

01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:48.634
Did you tell her'?

01:13:48.684 --> 01:13:50.236
What did you tell her?

01:13:50.286 --> 01:13:52.260
It's the grift.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.762
What are you talking about'?

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.409
We started without you,

01:13:55.459 --> 01:13:56.745
Xavier thinks that I've gone

01:13:56.795 --> 01:13:58.546
to pick up iris'
millionaire daddy

01:13:58.596 --> 01:14:02.581
to settle
her big fat drug debt.

01:14:02.631 --> 01:14:03.750
Hey, neither of us

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.088
were just gonna let you
walk away, foley.

01:14:06.138 --> 01:14:08.058
This could be your masterpiece.

01:14:08.108 --> 01:14:10.122
Wipe all those other clippings
off my wall.

01:14:10.172 --> 01:14:13.563
The chances of this working
are slim to none'

01:14:13.613 --> 01:14:14.930
oh.

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.333
Well, then those are the chances
of iris surviving the night.

01:14:17.383 --> 01:14:19.933
If we don't do this,
he'll put a bullet in her,

01:14:19.983 --> 01:14:21.804
I've seen him do it before
for a lot less.

01:14:21.854 --> 01:14:23.638
Why are you doing this to me?

01:14:23.688 --> 01:14:24.838
You know why.

01:14:24.888 --> 01:14:28.075
I didn't want to kill
your father, Ethan.

01:14:28.125 --> 01:14:30.108
I had no choice.

01:14:30.158 --> 01:14:33.645
So then you're familiar
with this kind of predicament,

01:14:33.695 --> 01:14:36.952
we're talking about
iris' life here,

01:14:37.002 --> 01:14:42.190
now is your chance
to finally play daddy.“

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.690
daddy,

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:49.653
suit up.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.664
Thought you were gonna shave.

01:15:22.714 --> 01:15:24.831
Nobody shaves at night.

01:15:24.881 --> 01:15:27.232
A grift is all about
the details.

01:16:21.437 --> 01:16:24.192
Here's daddy'

01:16:24.242 --> 01:16:25.859
I'm sorry to say
your little angel

01:16:25.909 --> 01:16:29.394
has got herself
into a bit of a bind.

01:16:29.444 --> 01:16:33.066
Well, unfortunately
this isn't the first time.

01:16:33.116 --> 01:16:34.234
How much does she owe you?

01:16:34.284 --> 01:16:36.436
$250,000.

01:16:36.486 --> 01:16:38.460
Bet you're loving this, huh?

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:40.641
More proof you were right
to send me away.

01:16:40.691 --> 01:16:42.579
I sent you away
for your own good.

01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:44.412
But you just wanted me
out of the way.

01:16:44.462 --> 01:16:47.316
You were never there for me.

01:16:47.366 --> 01:16:49.584
When mom died, I had nothing,

01:16:49.634 --> 01:16:50.953
nobody wanted me.

01:16:51.003 --> 01:16:52.253
This?

01:16:52.303 --> 01:16:54.776
This-what's happening here,
right now,

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:57.660
this is your doing!

01:16:57.710 --> 01:16:59.427
And in your usual fashion,

01:16:59.477 --> 01:17:01.950
you expect me
to pay for your mistakes!

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:03.096
Enough!

01:17:03.146 --> 01:17:04.765
This is not
family fucking therapy.

01:17:04.815 --> 01:17:07.290
I want my money now,

01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:15.074
please.

01:17:15.124 --> 01:17:18.745
Help me.

01:17:18.795 --> 01:17:22.083
Daddy, I need help.

01:17:30.006 --> 01:17:32.491
My cell phone.

01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:34.791
I didn't tell you
to do anything.

01:17:38.521 --> 01:17:39.835
I'm sorry.

01:17:39.885 --> 01:17:43.368
Had you planned on
cashing a check'?

01:17:43.418 --> 01:17:46.140
I'm going to make
an electronic transfer.

01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:49.478
So I'm supposed to give you,
what, my account information?

01:17:49.528 --> 01:17:51.380
I don't want
your account information'

01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:52.714
I don't want to know your name.

01:17:52.764 --> 01:17:57.716
I don't want to know
a goddamn thing about you.

01:17:57.766 --> 01:17:59.554
There.

01:17:59.604 --> 01:18:02.053
I've just moved all the funds

01:18:02.103 --> 01:18:03.824
out of one
of my offshore accounts,

01:18:03.874 --> 01:18:06.161
except for $250,000.

01:18:06.211 --> 01:18:08.328
I've deleted my pass code.

01:18:08.378 --> 01:18:10.063
All you need to do
is enter yours.

01:18:10.113 --> 01:18:11.900
You'll have full access
to the funds,

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:16.063
and you can transfer them
anywhere you want.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.214
Yes, I need you to check
on immediate activity

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:41.597
in the Belize account.

01:18:41.647 --> 01:18:42.762
Oh, yes, that's because

01:18:42.812 --> 01:18:47.400
I don't care
what time it is there.

01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:49.869
$250,000,

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:09.557
Are we done?

01:19:09.607 --> 01:19:13.395
How much do you keep
in these offshore accounts?

01:19:13.445 --> 01:19:15.730
Um, that particular one,

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:20.068
I had a little under
$3 million.

01:19:20.118 --> 01:19:22.438
Any with more than 8?

01:19:22.488 --> 01:19:25.408
Why?

01:19:25.458 --> 01:19:27.429
I'd like you
to consider a new deal.

01:19:30.833 --> 01:19:33.615
I have $8 million
that needs cleaning,

01:19:33.665 --> 01:19:34.781
and it seems to me

01:19:34.831 --> 01:19:38.783
you run
an excellent maid service,

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:40.655
now, before you decide-Vernon?

01:19:40.705 --> 01:19:43.350
Would you get us
a little taste?

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.899
This is going to be very nice.

01:19:51.949 --> 01:19:53.735
Are you building
a wine cellar'?

01:19:53.785 --> 01:19:56.903
Uh, yes.

01:19:56.953 --> 01:19:59.572
Ll once bought a divorce house

01:19:59.622 --> 01:20:01.910
because of the wine cellar.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.314
The wife, who was selling,
took me down

01:20:05.364 --> 01:20:07.115
because her
soon-to-be ex-husband's

01:20:07.165 --> 01:20:10.452
unbelievable collection
was still there.

01:20:10.502 --> 01:20:12.253
'59 lafite.

01:20:12.303 --> 01:20:13.656
'61 haut-brion.

01:20:13.706 --> 01:20:14.821
'45 brunello.

01:20:14.871 --> 01:20:17.355
Absolutely stupendous.

01:20:17.405 --> 01:20:19.492
And then my eye
catches the thermostat,

01:20:19.542 --> 01:20:22.628
and I say to her, "I don't know
how to tell you this",

01:20:22.678 --> 01:20:25.000
"but this cellar
should be at 55 degrees.

01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:28.167
This one's turned up to 76."

01:20:28.217 --> 01:20:32.305
And she looks at me
with a kind of squint in her eye

01:20:32.355 --> 01:20:37.776
and, just ice-cold
she says, "I know."

01:20:40.328 --> 01:20:42.150
Yes, I have a '61 lafite

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.318
I'm saving
for a special occasion,

01:20:45.368 --> 01:20:46.689
it's on its final turn

01:20:46.739 --> 01:20:51.249
and the top of the bottle
is going to be tired.

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:03.737
The rest is in the car,

01:21:03.787 --> 01:21:06.074
what's going on here?

01:21:06.124 --> 01:21:08.207
Watch and learn.

01:21:08.257 --> 01:21:11.209
The usual channels
cost me a minimum of 30%,

01:21:11.259 --> 01:21:13.683
that's $2.5 million.

01:21:13.733 --> 01:21:15.151
This is 8, clean.

01:21:15.201 --> 01:21:16.205
What if he tries to...

01:21:16.206 --> 01:21:17.519
He won't try anything.

01:21:17.569 --> 01:21:19.541
If he does,
we'll change his mind.

01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:24.026
It occurs to me

01:21:24.076 --> 01:21:27.761
that if you want my help
with your little problem,

01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:29.564
it should be worth more to me

01:21:29.614 --> 01:21:32.564
than just a return
of my $250,000.

01:21:32.614 --> 01:21:35.701
- And your daughter.
- 15%.

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:41.265
And so we agree on 10.

01:21:48.537 --> 01:21:51.541
I don't know.

01:21:57.306 --> 01:21:58.357
My God!

01:21:58.407 --> 01:21:59.728
What the fuck
did you do that for'?

01:21:59.778 --> 01:22:01.394
Thought you wanted
to change his mind.

01:22:01.444 --> 01:22:02.765
Help me!

01:22:02.815 --> 01:22:04.200
No, no, no, no.

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:06.433
The only way you can help
your daughter is to do the deal.

01:22:06.483 --> 01:22:08.135
I have to get her
to a hospital!

01:22:08.185 --> 01:22:10.159
And so you shall
when the business is done.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.540
Sit up. Sit up.

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:13.273
Put pressure on it. Hold it.

01:22:13.323 --> 01:22:15.306
What do you want me to do?

01:22:15.356 --> 01:22:16.475
The same as before.

01:22:16.525 --> 01:22:18.076
You put some funds
into an account for me.

01:22:18.126 --> 01:22:20.111
You lake your cash.
We never see each other again.

01:22:20.161 --> 01:22:21.637
Do we have a deal?

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:26.284
Do we have a deal?

01:22:26.334 --> 01:22:27.480
No.

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:33.853
No deal.

01:22:40.923 --> 01:22:42.068
He can't make the deal

01:22:42.118 --> 01:22:45.237
because he's not
a real estate developer.

01:22:45.287 --> 01:22:52.310
He's a grifter, and
this is a con.

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:57.818
Which makes you the mark.

01:22:57.868 --> 01:23:00.453
Why would you tell me this?

01:23:00.503 --> 01:23:04.827
Because nothing changes
unless you make it change.

01:23:04.877 --> 01:23:06.695
What the fuck
are you talking about'!

01:23:06.745 --> 01:23:10.218
I'm telling you because
I don't care about your money.

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:12.697
I just want that piece of shit
to know how close he came

01:23:12.747 --> 01:23:14.502
to getting
everything he ever wanted

01:23:14.552 --> 01:23:17.102
right before
you shoot him dead.

01:23:17.152 --> 01:23:20.441
No, not him!

01:23:20.491 --> 01:23:23.475
Him.

01:23:23.525 --> 01:23:24.644
She's lying!

01:23:24.694 --> 01:23:25.710
You little shit!

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.481
She is his daughter!

01:23:27.531 --> 01:23:30.116
I know, Ethan.

01:23:30.166 --> 01:23:31.520
He is your father!

01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:34.620
I know, Ethan.

01:23:34.670 --> 01:23:38.325
You can'! Hurt me anymore.

01:23:38.375 --> 01:23:40.020
You know'?

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.853
1 went to see Celia.

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:02.350
I have been
in this place before,

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:07.819
and there's only one way
for this to end'

01:24:07.869 --> 01:24:09.843
I will tell you
what you want to know,

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:11.260
and if you don't believe
what I say,

01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:13.893
then just put a bullet in me.

01:24:13.943 --> 01:24:15.589
Just let her go.

01:24:18.754 --> 01:24:22.133
Nobody is going anywhere
ever again.

01:24:29.495 --> 01:24:30.602
Oh!

01:24:36.038 --> 01:24:39.084
You okay? You stay here.

01:24:39.134 --> 01:24:41.246
Stay here. Stay here.

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:11.821
I am not going out
over $8 million.

01:25:11.871 --> 01:25:13.842
It's just money!

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:19.824
Take it.

01:25:19.874 --> 01:25:21.350
Take the money.

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:27.829
We can do a deal.

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:33.607
Do you know who I am?

01:25:33.657 --> 01:25:35.775
I know exactly who you are,

01:25:35.825 --> 01:25:37.612
that's why I have to do this.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.651
Let's go! Come on.

01:25:56.652 --> 01:25:58.298
We have to get out of here.
Let's go.

01:25:58.348 --> 01:25:59.864
No!

01:26:03.918 --> 01:26:04.892
Iris!

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:07.237
Oh, God.

01:26:24.939 --> 01:26:26.915
No, God!

01:26:53.902 --> 01:26:57.056
Miro, help us, please.

01:26:57.106 --> 01:26:59.028
She needs a blood transfusion
immediately,

01:26:59.078 --> 01:27:01.049
but the clinic
has no blood in storage.

01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:02.363
- Use me.
- No, no.

01:27:02.413 --> 01:27:04.064
We don't have time
to test for blood type.

01:27:04.114 --> 01:27:06.766
If I give her the wrong blood,
she will die.

01:27:06.816 --> 01:27:08.170
Can we find a relative?

01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:10.038
If-if they're related,
we got a better shot.

01:27:10.088 --> 01:27:11.507
Miro! Miro!

01:27:11.557 --> 01:27:13.062
It'll work.

01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:42.403
Miro... I have some money.

01:27:42.453 --> 01:27:44.536
This is where to find it.

01:27:44.586 --> 01:27:47.808
Take what you need.

01:27:47.858 --> 01:27:49.075
And the rest to her.

01:27:49.125 --> 01:27:51.778
Foley,
you will not survive this.

01:27:51.828 --> 01:27:55.482
Let me stop the transfusion.

01:27:55.532 --> 01:27:57.450
She needs a second chance.

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:11.122
Now, I just need you
to sign here and here, please.

01:29:11.172 --> 01:29:14.659
How long will the transfer
take, exactly?

01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:17.527
Just a moment.

01:29:19.888 --> 01:29:21.731
Exactly that long.

01:29:25.227 --> 01:29:27.339
How long did you plan to visit?

01:29:27.389 --> 01:29:29.035
I'm not sure.

01:29:31.166 --> 01:29:34.583
How long does it take
to get lost?

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.866
If you keep on doing
what you've always done,

01:29:51.916 --> 01:29:56.204
you'll keep on being
what you've always been.

01:29:56.254 --> 01:30:00.541
Nothing changes
unless you make it change.

01:30:00.591 --> 01:30:02.607
I know what it sounds like,

01:30:02.657 --> 01:30:05.244
but every morning
when I wake up,

01:30:05.294 --> 01:30:09.584
I think about
what that really means.

01:30:09.634 --> 01:30:13.916
Nothing changes
unless you make it change.

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:52.354
Summer keeps falling
I keep remembering.

01:30:52.357 --> 01:30:58.000
When you were lost in the all.

01:30:58.006 --> 01:31:03.203
Time wasn't fading,
I keep forgetting.

01:31:03.204 --> 01:31:08.677
You were the one that I love.

01:31:08.678 --> 01:31:15.357
Soon we'll be riding away
in the night.

01:31:15.358 --> 01:31:21.775
Falling till the oceans
are crying.

01:31:21.776 --> 01:31:28.386
' Soon you will arrive
in the only all.

01:31:28.389 --> 01:31:32.769
Only I'm waiting till someday

01:31:32.770 --> 01:31:37.879
I'll be on your right.

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:44.593
To the only one in your life.

01:31:44.594 --> 01:31:51.341
And the only one
that I will love.

01:31:51.342 --> 01:31:54.448
That's you and I.
