WEBVTT

03:26.840 --> 03:27.881
Sorry.

03:31.464 --> 03:33.381
Alright, drive?
- Alright, Herb?

04:32.038 --> 04:35.496
There seems to be no change
in your circumstances.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.245
So we have to move on.

04:42.744 --> 04:44.952
This is all this is to you,
isn't it?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.327
A fucking game.

04:47.410 --> 04:50.368
It's not personal, Mr...
- Well, not to you, no!

04:51.451 --> 04:53.743
So what am I supposed to do,
huh?

04:53.868 --> 04:57.367
What about my depression?
What about my bad back?

04:58.700 --> 05:03.741
Medical reports indicate
you are sick no longer.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.730
How is that old motorbike going, Id?

06:18.770 --> 06:20.395
New daps, love?

07:15.594 --> 07:18.552
Yeah?
- Ken, how's it going? Me, it is.

07:18.677 --> 07:20.844
No Ken here, mate.
Wrong number.

07:20.969 --> 07:23.760
You sure?
- Well, what do you think?

07:23.885 --> 07:27.718
Keep your fucking hair on.
- Fuck... you!

07:28.676 --> 07:30.009
Fucking prick!

07:42.840 --> 07:45.340
Come on, son.

07:59.837 --> 08:02.254
He's done it.

08:02.379 --> 08:05.253
He's fucking fixed it.

08:05.378 --> 08:06.836
You fixed it!

08:08.294 --> 08:10.294
You fucking fixed it!

08:12.794 --> 08:16.085
Jesus Christ, man,
you're a genius.

08:17.376 --> 08:18.751
Good as new.

08:31.832 --> 08:35.457
Something must be wrong.
- I'm off the fucking sick, man.

08:36.789 --> 08:39.996
I'm gonna lose like 40 quid
a fucking week. I'm screwed.

08:40.789 --> 08:44.080
That's austerity, that is, Herb.
I've seen it on the news.

08:46.455 --> 08:49.454
It's always fucking austerity
round here, mate.

08:49.579 --> 08:53.704
We're just helpless components
in a global system.

08:53.829 --> 08:58.328
That's all we are.
Whichever way they turn, it hurts.

08:58.453 --> 08:59.494
Listen...

09:01.577 --> 09:03.660
Whatever you need, like.

09:03.785 --> 09:06.285
I'm here for you, you know that.

09:09.326 --> 09:12.867
Be careful. It's gonna be you next.
I fucking swear, mate.

09:14.658 --> 09:16.991
Hey, thanks for fixing
the record player.

09:17.158 --> 09:19.283
Can sort my vinyl out now,
no excuses.

09:19.408 --> 09:20.449
No worries.

09:20.574 --> 09:23.490
New daps? They're tidy.
- Yeah. Not bad, eh?

09:23.574 --> 09:25.198
Come on.

09:25.323 --> 09:28.281
Jesus, man!
- Oh, fuck's sake, Wal!

09:28.406 --> 09:30.948
The vet says I need
to stop giving him trifle.

09:31.114 --> 09:34.405
Why are you giving him trifle?
- He really likes trifle.

09:35.238 --> 09:36.780
Oh, that's bad, that is.

09:37.780 --> 09:40.488
Hey, thanks for this anyway.
- Yeah.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.404
See you later.
- Okay, mate.

09:42.529 --> 09:44.862
Come on, then. Off we go.

09:47.528 --> 09:49.944
Oh, fuck, no!

10:01.109 --> 10:04.067
Pembrokeshire across
to parts of Powys

10:04.234 --> 10:06.442
up to 40 millimetres of rain
expected.

10:06.567 --> 10:08.733
Already falling
on to saturated ground

10:08.858 --> 10:12.024
and the river levels are high
so there is a risk...

10:34.521 --> 10:36.728
Yeah?
- Ken. Me, it is.

10:36.853 --> 10:39.811
Fuck me. How many times?
- You again?

10:39.936 --> 10:42.186
Well, yeah,
cos it's my fucking phone!

10:42.311 --> 10:44.144
Wanker!
- Fuck!

11:07.140 --> 11:09.598
Hello, Mam.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.012
Straight for the food.
Would it kill you to say hello?

11:24.179 --> 11:25.262
Hiya.

11:26.345 --> 11:27.887
Look at the state of you.

11:28.012 --> 11:31.261
Your father was a pain in the arse,
but you know what?

11:31.386 --> 11:33.261
I think you've even beaten him.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.302
Shall I fix this?

11:35.386 --> 11:37.969
It's next door,
but there's no money, mind!

11:38.593 --> 11:39.843
I'll fix it.

11:39.968 --> 11:42.676
Take it with you, then,
I don't want mess here.

11:43.801 --> 11:45.467
Did you get a card for Francis?
- Yeah.

11:45.592 --> 11:47.175
Put money in it?
- Yes!

11:47.300 --> 11:49.008
More than a fiver, I hope.

11:51.008 --> 11:52.674
Your own son.

11:53.716 --> 11:54.882
No wonder they left.

11:56.424 --> 12:00.632
Why do you keep watering that plant?
It bloody stinks in here.

12:04.714 --> 12:06.964
Never guess who I saw
last night.

12:07.630 --> 12:09.005
The Captain!

12:11.130 --> 12:13.713
What, Kirk?
- I think it's his father.

12:13.796 --> 12:15.671
Gone doolally, they say.

12:15.754 --> 12:18.670
Pissed in the pound shop
over the cream crackers.

12:18.754 --> 12:21.378
Jacob's they were, too.
No cheap muck.

13:01.205 --> 13:02.580
Friend or foe?

13:03.621 --> 13:05.204
Oh, it's you.

13:06.204 --> 13:08.912
Is that your toaster?
- Yeah. No.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.953
Whose is it?
- Is the Captain home?

13:13.203 --> 13:14.536
He's down the shed.

13:24.743 --> 13:28.159
Herb, you arsehole.
- Where's the love, man?

13:28.284 --> 13:31.742
My best mate rolls into town
like it's 2002 and doesn't call!

13:31.825 --> 13:34.741
I was going to.
- You look good, man.

13:34.866 --> 13:37.616
Since we're lying,
you look fucking amazing.

13:39.407 --> 13:42.782
Still got the gift?
- Same shit, different decade.

13:42.907 --> 13:45.739
Where's me fucking backy?

13:45.864 --> 13:48.989
I'm sorry!
- Give me a minute.

13:52.697 --> 13:55.071
Grab hold of him.
- I don't like birds.

13:55.196 --> 13:56.446
He's alright.

13:56.571 --> 13:58.821
Kirk, I need you now, son!

14:00.529 --> 14:02.278
So, how are your folks?

14:05.236 --> 14:07.736
Dad fucked off
couple of years ago.

14:07.819 --> 14:10.444
So, it's just...
Just mum now. Yeah.

14:11.485 --> 14:12.818
You not with her?

14:12.943 --> 14:16.318
Living with her? Christ, no!
I got my own place.

14:17.068 --> 14:18.193
Francine?

14:19.401 --> 14:20.692
Divorced, mate.

14:21.567 --> 14:23.400
Done and dusted. Over.

14:25.108 --> 14:27.149
Frankie?
- Frankie's...

14:30.524 --> 14:34.023
I don't see much of him
at the moment, but...

14:40.772 --> 14:42.272
No good news here, mate.

14:43.355 --> 14:44.772
You know how it goes.

14:44.855 --> 14:48.521
What have you been up to?
- I've been on the ships mostly.

14:48.646 --> 14:51.520
Been round the world, Herb.
Seen some shit, I have.

14:52.104 --> 14:53.562
Good and bad.

14:53.687 --> 14:56.895
Not sure if I'm done.
Way the world is now, who knows.

14:57.061 --> 14:59.686
We'll see what happens here,
with the old man.

14:59.811 --> 15:03.602
Don't know what I'm gonna do.
Yeah, stick around, I suppose.

15:08.268 --> 15:09.976
So you never got out then?

15:13.100 --> 15:16.100
Fucking hell. How many lives
do you think you've got?

15:16.766 --> 15:18.683
Where are me glasses?

15:19.683 --> 15:22.224
I can't find me glasses.
- They're there.

15:23.599 --> 15:25.140
Where?

15:25.265 --> 15:27.640
There, round your fucking neck!

15:27.765 --> 15:30.472
He's doing
my fucking head in, he is.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.430
I can't read without my glasses!

15:32.555 --> 15:34.888
Round your neck,
you fucking idiot!

15:35.055 --> 15:38.138
I was just telling your mum.
- Shut up!

15:38.263 --> 15:40.471
She sends her love.
- Shut up!

15:52.219 --> 15:55.552
You want some blow?
- Fucking right, tidy. Cheers.

16:00.884 --> 16:03.675
You gonna answer that?
- It's not for me.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.758
Who's it for?
- Ken.

16:05.842 --> 16:07.966
Who's Ken?
- Fuck knows.

16:12.882 --> 16:16.257
Fancy a pint?
- Got to see to the old man.

16:16.382 --> 16:18.673
Oh, yeah.
- Tomorrow, maybe.

16:18.798 --> 16:20.798
Kirk! Kirk!
- OK.

16:21.631 --> 16:23.339
I've got to go.

16:23.464 --> 16:25.588
Cheers.
- I don't know what to do!

16:25.713 --> 16:28.421
Good to see you. Welcome back.
- You too.

16:58.416 --> 16:59.458
Hiya, mate.

16:59.541 --> 17:03.082
Alright, bud?
- Yeah, good. One large, please.

17:04.207 --> 17:06.915
Soak them up, Screwy.
I'm fucking starving, mate.

17:07.082 --> 17:09.580
Here you go.
- Tidy.

17:09.705 --> 17:13.122
Double. Dregs and all.
- Oh, lovely. Good evening.

17:28.412 --> 17:30.911
Excuse me, bud,
do you have the time on you?

17:31.078 --> 17:33.494
Sorry, mate, no.
I don't have the time.

17:33.619 --> 17:37.202
Any money, half pint of piss?
- Have I fuck got money.

17:37.327 --> 17:39.410
Give us a chip.
- Fucking ginger!

17:39.535 --> 17:41.160
Fucking hell!

17:41.285 --> 17:43.659
Calm down
or I'll cut your fucking throat.

17:43.784 --> 17:46.284
You fucking calm down.
- Shut up!

17:46.409 --> 17:49.325
Got anything on you?
- Relax. I ain't got nothing.

17:49.450 --> 17:52.866
Everybody's got something.
- I got fucking nothing. Relax.

17:52.949 --> 17:55.074
What's this?
- A shit phone.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.282
Yeah, it is.
- Nice one.

17:57.407 --> 17:59.490
Shut up!
- This prick is strapless.

17:59.615 --> 18:02.323
No money, no nothing.
Just a fucking toaster.

18:02.448 --> 18:05.739
Get his fucking jacket.
- My fucking head!

18:07.114 --> 18:09.197
Fuck! Fucking...

18:09.322 --> 18:12.779
Grab his creps, boys.
- Don't take the shoes.

18:12.904 --> 18:15.654
Shut the fuck up!

18:17.195 --> 18:19.612
What a wanker.
- Fuck!

19:41.848 --> 19:44.514
Shut up!

19:44.639 --> 19:48.930
Allow me to take you on a tour,
lifestyle of the luxurious

19:49.055 --> 19:50.597
and incarcerated.

19:50.722 --> 19:54.888
Sometimes getting locked up
is a 5-star experience.

19:55.013 --> 19:58.845
It definitely is if you are
doing time in Denmark.

19:58.970 --> 20:01.220
This is like going
to a resort.

20:01.345 --> 20:03.636
They have a key
to their personal cell.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.594
If the prisoners have a key,
it's a hotel.

20:06.719 --> 20:09.469
They have jobs
from 8:30 to 3:30 every day.

20:09.594 --> 20:11.385
They do farming, chop wood...

20:11.510 --> 20:14.760
Things people on
a self-sustaining village do.

20:15.135 --> 20:19.176
There's home school, gym area
to simulate a normal routine.

20:19.300 --> 20:22.133
Let me take you into a cell.
- I want to go.

20:22.258 --> 20:24.841
100-square-foot cell offers you

20:24.966 --> 20:28.466
private toilet, private shower,
a mini-fridge.

20:28.591 --> 20:32.215
The private shower
is a big deal in prison.

20:32.340 --> 20:35.423
If you drop the soap...
- You just pick it up.

20:35.548 --> 20:36.589
Pick it up.

20:36.673 --> 20:40.589
There's unbarred windows,
aka just windows.

20:40.714 --> 20:44.255
And flat screen television
in your room.

20:44.380 --> 20:46.754
Stroll on down
to the prison supermarket,

20:46.879 --> 20:49.171
where you can buy stuff
once a week.

20:49.296 --> 20:50.879
How can you buy stuff?

20:51.045 --> 20:54.295
You get paid to leave your room
and do stuff in prison.

20:54.420 --> 20:58.627
Let's steal stuff.
- Import surstrÃ¶mming.

20:58.752 --> 21:01.210
And we'll go to prison
together.

21:58.409 --> 22:00.492
Wonder if I can print
this stuff out.

22:33.487 --> 22:36.112
Fuck's sake, Herb,
you taking the piss?

22:36.195 --> 22:39.403
They're gonna think you've
escaped from the loony bin.

22:41.111 --> 22:43.777
It's a BB Gun.
- So?

22:43.902 --> 22:45.360
You need a real gun.

22:45.485 --> 22:48.735
Where do I get a real gun from,
the fucking Social?

22:50.234 --> 22:52.901
Anyway, I don't care
about that shit!

22:54.317 --> 22:57.192
I don't wanna get away with it.
I wanna get caught!

23:01.149 --> 23:04.357
So? Kirk?
What do you think, mate?

23:05.732 --> 23:07.190
Look, boys...

23:09.481 --> 23:11.231
I get a tidy cell,

23:11.856 --> 23:13.647
I get a job to go to,

23:14.689 --> 23:16.105
no bills,

23:16.188 --> 23:18.313
a get a flat screen fucking TV,

23:18.438 --> 23:20.729
good medical treatment,
a dentist...

23:20.854 --> 23:24.437
You can't get a dentist here.
Not a National Health one.

23:24.562 --> 23:26.645
I get fucking peace
and quiet.

23:26.770 --> 23:29.145
That dozy prick upstairs,
he never stops.

23:29.228 --> 23:31.228
I'm safer in there
than out here.

23:31.353 --> 23:34.352
I got fucking mugged last night
by a bunch of... kids!

23:35.852 --> 23:38.143
Not long out of nappies.
- A bit of ointment.

23:38.268 --> 23:41.684
Yeah, it fucking hurts!
- You sure about this, Herb?

23:43.976 --> 23:46.850
I have to do something.
OK?

23:49.016 --> 23:51.683
Because it's like fucking
"Groundhog Day" here.

23:53.349 --> 23:57.140
And if I don't leave now,
I am going to die here.

23:59.765 --> 24:01.306
I'm gonna fucking die.

24:06.430 --> 24:09.221
Harry the Horse goes that way.
- Which way?

24:09.346 --> 24:13.096
To Harwich. You go to Harwich
to get the boat to Denmark.

24:13.179 --> 24:14.221
Oh, yeah?

24:14.304 --> 24:17.345
Yeah, I've got his number
on my phone somewhere.

24:18.137 --> 24:21.136
So, what's the plan, Herb?
- Right.

24:22.344 --> 24:23.802
I'm gonna go to Denmark.

24:23.927 --> 24:26.427
I'm gonna walk
to the nearest town.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.427
I'm gonna do the deed.
And I'm gonna get banged up.

24:30.551 --> 24:32.593
Keep it simple.
Cut the overheads.

24:32.718 --> 24:35.717
You can't barge in there
like Billy the fucking Kid.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.300
Why not?
- Cos the world is crazy.

24:38.425 --> 24:41.008
Watch the news!
Some arsehole might think

24:41.133 --> 24:43.841
you're a jihadist
and blow your fucking head off.

24:43.966 --> 24:46.674
The cops will waste you.
They got guns.

24:46.799 --> 24:48.673
Guns? Have they?
- Yeah.

24:48.798 --> 24:52.214
You gotta keep it simple.
You know, shout, make a noise.

24:52.298 --> 24:55.631
Tell them what you want,
make sure they get the message.

24:56.505 --> 24:57.922
Get it right.

24:59.088 --> 25:00.671
Fuck's sake, Wally!

25:00.796 --> 25:03.796
He's a fucking menace.
Stinks of shit all the time.

25:03.921 --> 25:06.046
He's got IBS.
- I don't know what that is.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.337
Shut the fuck up!

25:08.795 --> 25:10.295
Christ!

25:13.169 --> 25:15.211
No one gives a fuck about us!

25:17.210 --> 25:18.335
Don't you see that?

25:19.418 --> 25:22.543
People fucking despise me,
who don't even know me

25:22.668 --> 25:26.042
cos I haven't got a job in
a place where there are no jobs!

25:29.875 --> 25:31.042
Well, fuck 'em!

25:35.499 --> 25:36.791
Fuck 'em all.

25:42.290 --> 25:45.581
They can kiss my skiving arse
cos I am f... I am off.

25:47.497 --> 25:49.663
Do you want his number?
- Whose?

25:49.788 --> 25:52.871
Harry the Horse, you turd.
- Nice one, mate, yeah.

25:53.038 --> 25:55.329
I haven't got a phone.
You got a pen?

25:55.454 --> 25:57.037
No.
- You got a pen?

25:57.162 --> 25:58.245
No.

26:03.453 --> 26:05.119
Oh, fucking hell.

26:16.159 --> 26:18.034
Id. Hiya, bud!

26:19.367 --> 26:22.200
Alright, boy?
- Fucking phone!

26:22.283 --> 26:24.991
Get in.
- Oh, tidy, mate. Cheers.

26:54.320 --> 26:58.069
Hello?
- Hello, it's me. Is he there?

26:58.194 --> 27:00.319
Hang on. It's your dad.

27:01.319 --> 27:03.402
Hello?
- Hello, mate.

27:05.276 --> 27:06.818
It's me, it is.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.692
Did you...

27:12.025 --> 27:14.150
You get the card?
- Yeah.

27:14.275 --> 27:16.066
The fiver?
- Yeah. Thanks.

27:16.191 --> 27:18.024
No, no problem.

27:19.857 --> 27:22.523
So, is everything OK?
- Guess so.

27:27.189 --> 27:30.189
Well, I should let you go.
- Yeah, alright.

27:30.314 --> 27:31.689
OK, mate.

27:31.814 --> 27:33.563
OK, bye. Love...

28:04.017 --> 28:05.808
Don't fucking an...

28:05.933 --> 28:08.099
Hello, Harry!
- Who wants to know?

28:08.224 --> 28:11.307
Hello, it's Herb here...

28:11.390 --> 28:13.515
Aubrey said
I should give you a call.

29:00.008 --> 29:03.299
What's going on? What are you
doing with that door?

29:03.382 --> 29:05.507
What are you doing in here?

29:05.632 --> 29:07.173
Look, I'm leaving tonight.

29:07.298 --> 29:10.381
Harry the Horse is gonna give me
a lift and he's not gonna wait.

29:10.506 --> 29:13.005
Harry the Horse?
Leaving tonight? Where?

29:13.130 --> 29:15.922
You said I could have
some of the old man's stuff.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.879
Tell me where the shoes are.
- You'll lose your dole.

29:19.046 --> 29:21.837
Need a pair of shoes.
- Don't you come sponging here.

29:22.004 --> 29:23.545
I've not got money.

29:23.670 --> 29:27.045
Life hasn't given me much.
It's not that I haven't tried.

29:27.170 --> 29:29.878
I've always tried to do what...
- Ma!

29:32.127 --> 29:33.835
Shut your gob!

29:38.251 --> 29:39.668
What happened?

29:40.584 --> 29:42.001
Who hurt you?

29:44.209 --> 29:45.583
Doesn't matter.

29:48.416 --> 29:49.833
Shoes, is it?

29:51.208 --> 29:53.707
In the trunk.
- Just want a pair of shoes.

29:53.832 --> 29:55.332
Don't go making a mess.

29:56.623 --> 29:58.415
I tidied at Easter.

30:12.579 --> 30:13.621
Well...

30:14.745 --> 30:16.079
What do you think?

30:17.787 --> 30:21.119
I don't know.
What do you expect me to think?

30:21.244 --> 30:23.036
Gotta do this, Ma.

30:23.161 --> 30:24.994
Please don't give me
a hard time.

31:05.529 --> 31:07.487
Hey! Are you Herb?
- Yeah.

31:07.612 --> 31:09.445
Get your arse in here,
I'm late!

31:09.528 --> 31:10.695
Fuck me !

31:15.860 --> 31:18.485
Hiya. Thanks very much for this.

31:20.568 --> 31:21.818
Oh, this is nice.

31:23.276 --> 31:25.901
Wow, nice colours and stuff.

31:37.357 --> 31:38.440
The belt is stuck.

31:38.523 --> 31:40.398
Get your hands off.
- Dangerous.

31:40.481 --> 31:43.189
You wanna wait for a bus?
Don't touch the belt.

31:48.355 --> 31:51.313
Is there a... toilet on board?

31:51.813 --> 31:54.688
A what?
- For a piss. Is there a toilet?

31:55.312 --> 31:58.978
Behind the shower at the back.
Just turn left.

31:59.103 --> 32:03.353
Of course there's not a toilet!
It's a fucking lorry!

32:03.478 --> 32:06.061
Really need a piss, though.
Can you pull over?

32:13.768 --> 32:14.976
Out!

32:32.473 --> 32:35.014
Aubrey's given me the SP.
Told me everything.

32:35.139 --> 32:37.181
Everything?
- Everything.

32:39.389 --> 32:41.305
Incarceration tourism.

32:42.596 --> 32:44.513
That's a fucking new one.

32:45.554 --> 32:48.679
Good to have an idea,
but have you thought this through?

32:48.804 --> 32:49.887
No.
- No.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.136
Doing time
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

32:55.261 --> 32:56.636
Trust me. I know this.

32:58.552 --> 33:00.760
You miss the small things
in life.

33:02.093 --> 33:03.468
Going for a pint.

33:05.259 --> 33:07.092
Taking a shit in private.

33:09.342 --> 33:11.758
Ever shit in a bucket?
- Never in my life.

33:11.883 --> 33:14.550
Glad to hear that.
Dirty bastards.

33:16.133 --> 33:18.007
Does my fucking head in.
- Buckets?

33:18.132 --> 33:19.549
Not the bucket, the...

33:20.507 --> 33:21.840
The small things.

33:22.340 --> 33:23.381
Yeah.

33:23.465 --> 33:25.048
And then there's this.

33:28.547 --> 33:29.672
Fuck!

33:33.505 --> 33:37.213
Emotional stuff, the big stuff,
the family, spiritual baggage.

33:42.962 --> 33:45.045
I got fuck all, mate,
to be honest.

33:46.211 --> 33:47.294
Kids?

33:49.502 --> 33:50.544
Hope?

33:52.543 --> 33:54.501
As I say, I got fuck all.

34:06.208 --> 34:07.583
My son gave it to me.

34:14.706 --> 34:16.414
Used to make him laugh.

34:17.706 --> 34:20.996
Make you laugh?
- No. Not anymore, no.

34:27.079 --> 34:29.286
In Harwich
you're gonna need money.

34:29.411 --> 34:31.079
You got any?
- Only a bit.

34:31.204 --> 34:33.828
Haven't got much?
You're a fuckwit, ain't you?

34:33.995 --> 34:35.578
Yes.
- You are a...

34:36.411 --> 34:41.159
Fucking hell. For a little bit I
might be able to get you there.

34:41.284 --> 34:43.952
In the back of a container.
- That's illegal.

34:44.077 --> 34:46.493
Course it's fucking illegal,
you fuckwit!

34:46.618 --> 34:49.284
It's not legal, is it?
Fucking illegal!

34:50.492 --> 34:53.783
Listen, whatever you say, eh.
Whatever you say.

35:20.696 --> 35:22.737
You, stay here.

35:23.612 --> 35:24.820
Do not move.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.023
Come on, down you come.

36:01.356 --> 36:02.564
You got a ride.

36:03.272 --> 36:06.188
Now listen,
you're a stupid motherfucker,

36:06.772 --> 36:08.063
but you're OK.

36:10.646 --> 36:12.937
Could be lucky out there,
you never know.

36:13.937 --> 36:16.187
You may get more
than you bargained for.

36:19.436 --> 36:20.603
Right.

36:20.686 --> 36:23.311
It's gonna be a bit rough,
but you'll be fine.

36:23.436 --> 36:26.227
Alright, be safe.
And watch where you piss.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.310
Thanks very much, Harry.
Thank you.

36:33.809 --> 36:36.642
Harry, how long
until this goes on the ship?

36:36.725 --> 36:39.016
About six hours.
- What the fuck?

37:05.720 --> 37:07.178
Fuck!

37:34.216 --> 37:35.424
Now, mate!

37:35.549 --> 37:37.590
It's time.
So now you have to go out.

37:45.339 --> 37:46.380
Out with you.

39:27.489 --> 39:29.114
Oh, fucking hell!

41:00.765 --> 41:02.890
Do you speak English?
- Yeah, I do.

41:02.973 --> 41:04.931
A lot of choice...
- Are you English?

41:05.056 --> 41:07.973
No, I'm Welsh.
From Wales. Welshman.

41:08.098 --> 41:10.389
Tom fucking Jones!

41:10.514 --> 41:13.847
You're Tom fucking Jones!
- He's harmless.

41:13.972 --> 41:16.680
Don't pay him attention.
- What he's drinking.

41:16.805 --> 41:19.012
OK.
- Steen. Tom fucking Jones, man!

41:19.137 --> 41:20.804
Play something!
- Please, just shut up?

41:20.929 --> 41:22.720
Yeah. Relax.

41:26.011 --> 41:28.303
Are you going to sing?

41:29.053 --> 41:30.344
Sing?
- No.

41:30.469 --> 41:32.302
Here you go.
- I'm not gonna sing.

41:32.427 --> 41:34.343
Thanks very much, cheers.

41:38.426 --> 41:39.634
Yes, you are.

41:43.425 --> 41:45.092
The old home town

41:46.550 --> 41:47.841
Looks the same

41:50.049 --> 41:51.591
As I stepped down

41:52.924 --> 41:54.340
From the train

41:55.923 --> 41:58.923
There to meet me

41:59.006 --> 42:01.381
Is my mama

42:02.922 --> 42:04.005
And papa

42:08.546 --> 42:10.421
Down the road

42:10.546 --> 42:12.046
I looked

42:12.171 --> 42:15.128
And there comes Mary

42:16.628 --> 42:17.836
Hair of gold

42:18.669 --> 42:21.252
And lips like cherry

42:22.252 --> 42:23.752
It's good to touch

42:24.918 --> 42:29.168
The green, green grass of home

42:43.165 --> 42:44.290
Alright, bud?

42:44.957 --> 42:45.998
Hiya.

43:03.829 --> 43:05.204
Beer's good here.

43:05.995 --> 43:07.953
Thank you.
We make it ourselves.

43:09.828 --> 43:11.286
Yeah, I love beer.

43:11.411 --> 43:13.244
I'd have a bath in it
if I could.

43:15.202 --> 43:16.868
Not really, like.

43:18.743 --> 43:20.201
I'm Matilda.

43:22.076 --> 43:23.117
Herb.

43:24.742 --> 43:27.200
You were good tonight, Mr. Herb.
- How so?

43:27.325 --> 43:30.158
On the stage and everything.

43:30.283 --> 43:32.782
Yeah, it's a nice song.

43:34.032 --> 43:35.907
Gets you here, every time, like.

43:37.198 --> 43:39.073
It does me, anyway.

43:39.198 --> 43:40.739
Still...

43:40.906 --> 43:42.031
It was good.

43:42.572 --> 43:43.697
Who is the...

43:43.906 --> 43:46.239
Who's the fella with the hat
and the beard?

43:46.405 --> 43:49.030
Pay no attention.
He's the local loudmouth.

43:49.155 --> 43:50.696
He's got some chops on him.

43:51.779 --> 43:53.154
Chops, yeah.

43:54.404 --> 43:56.695
Well, he's clearly taken
a liking to you.

43:56.862 --> 43:58.028
Oh, no.

44:01.111 --> 44:03.777
Are you in Denmark for long?

44:05.235 --> 44:07.985
I dunno, maybe. Maybe, yeah.

44:08.110 --> 44:12.193
Just here to do some work?
- No. No...

44:16.109 --> 44:18.108
I never been abroad before.

44:19.608 --> 44:22.774
I was supposed to go to Spain
couple of years ago with a mate.

44:22.941 --> 44:25.149
Jack the Rat
on a back and fore job,

44:25.274 --> 44:28.315
booze and fags run, but my
old man left that weekend.

44:28.440 --> 44:30.273
I had to stay with my mum.

44:30.398 --> 44:34.106
And I didn't really
hear about it again.

44:36.147 --> 44:37.689
Never been anywhere since.

44:38.522 --> 44:39.647
So...

44:40.521 --> 44:42.854
Well... now you have.

44:42.979 --> 44:44.271
Yeah.

44:46.145 --> 44:47.437
Now I have.

45:38.054 --> 45:39.429
What the fuck?

46:15.131 --> 46:16.839
Goodnight.
- Night.

46:18.339 --> 46:20.339
Tom fucking Jones.

46:55.291 --> 46:56.999
Okay.

47:11.414 --> 47:12.747
You talking to me?

47:15.163 --> 47:16.454
Are you...

47:16.579 --> 47:18.121
Are you talking to me?

47:25.745 --> 47:27.661
I don't see anybody else here.

47:27.786 --> 47:29.702
Are you talking to me?

47:34.826 --> 47:37.326
You talk... Talking to me?

47:39.159 --> 47:40.992
Fucking hell!

48:54.355 --> 48:55.855
Need a fucking piss.

48:55.980 --> 48:58.230
Go and have a fucking piss
and then...

48:58.355 --> 49:00.354
I'll have a piss.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.561
Do you mind if I... Cheers.

49:18.726 --> 49:20.226
Fuck's sake.

49:20.351 --> 49:22.726
Oh, look. Does that work?

49:24.100 --> 49:25.267
Oh, look at that.

49:27.017 --> 49:28.350
That's strange.

49:30.099 --> 49:31.557
Oh, fuck me, look.

49:48.138 --> 49:49.221
Fuck!

49:49.305 --> 49:51.221
Oh, alright, bud?

49:57.012 --> 49:58.053
Fuck!

50:16.967 --> 50:18.383
Oh, I need a shit.

50:20.591 --> 50:22.049
Christ's sake!

50:22.174 --> 50:24.382
Hiya, mate. Sorry. Cheers.

50:25.632 --> 50:27.340
Do you wanna take your...

50:27.465 --> 50:28.507
Tidy.

50:33.214 --> 50:35.464
Sorry, mate, you got any paper?
Paper?

50:36.547 --> 50:38.005
Cheers, thanks.

50:39.463 --> 50:41.296
Alright then, boy.

50:41.421 --> 50:44.296
It's now or never if you ask me.

50:45.587 --> 50:47.212
Let's fucking do this.

51:04.084 --> 51:05.875
What the fuck?

51:13.124 --> 51:14.957
Give me the money, motherfucker.

51:15.416 --> 51:17.499
Or I'll blow
your fucking brains out.

51:27.372 --> 51:29.288
Give me the money.

51:29.455 --> 51:31.413
I'll blow
your fucking brains out.

51:35.037 --> 51:36.454
What's this kid want now?

51:38.370 --> 51:40.162
What the fuck. One.

51:40.911 --> 51:42.036
Two.

51:44.786 --> 51:45.911
Fuck!

52:31.570 --> 52:33.611
Hi. I see you've made a friend.

52:33.820 --> 52:36.444
Oh, yeah, him. No.
He's a good man.

52:36.611 --> 52:38.944
Not seeing the sights, then?
- Nah. No.

52:39.110 --> 52:40.193
May I?
- Please.

52:40.360 --> 52:43.068
I need a cigarette.
It's been such a busy day.

52:43.235 --> 52:44.359
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

52:47.234 --> 52:49.234
So, what about you?
How's your day?

52:53.733 --> 52:56.358
Not homesick yet?
- Oh, Christ, no. No, no.

53:00.107 --> 53:04.773
Your accent, it's... funny for me.
I'm not used to it.

53:05.939 --> 53:07.314
Are you from Wales?
- Correct.

53:07.439 --> 53:10.022
I've heard
it's such a beautiful country.

53:15.813 --> 53:17.479
Not the place I'm from.

53:18.396 --> 53:21.062
You have mountains and hills.
Such wonders.

53:21.228 --> 53:22.895
Here it's... mostly flat.

53:23.062 --> 53:26.269
Flat is good. Hills are not
all they're cracked up to be.

53:26.394 --> 53:30.602
Hills are a pain in the arse.
Up and down with shopping.

53:30.810 --> 53:31.893
Not to be recommended.

53:32.060 --> 53:35.018
My fucking arms are six inches longer
than before I moved in.

53:35.185 --> 53:37.434
My English is not so good.

53:37.559 --> 53:40.392
Well, actually,
it's better than most I know.

53:46.308 --> 53:48.391
So, what's it like
where you're from?

53:48.516 --> 53:50.765
It's... fucked.

53:52.348 --> 53:55.515
It's full of warmth, you know?
Full of warmth and humour.

53:55.681 --> 53:58.097
For such a crappy place
it's quite funny.

53:58.222 --> 53:59.639
But it's dying, you know.

53:59.806 --> 54:01.014
It's dying and...

54:01.930 --> 54:04.388
I had to get out
before it took me with it.

54:08.179 --> 54:11.304
So, is that what this is?
Getting out?

54:11.845 --> 54:13.178
Maybe.

54:13.887 --> 54:16.011
I'm still thinking about it.

54:16.178 --> 54:18.511
Matilda,
you not gone home yet?

54:19.261 --> 54:21.135
No, not yet.

54:31.134 --> 54:34.383
Is everything okay, Mr. Herb?
- Yeah, no.

54:34.508 --> 54:35.800
Everything is fine.

54:40.132 --> 54:43.507
Well, I'm going to be late,
so I should go.

54:45.132 --> 54:47.839
We must do this again.
- That would be nice.

54:48.339 --> 54:50.631
Bye.
- Have a nice day.

54:57.130 --> 54:59.129
Would you like to come
for something to eat?

54:59.296 --> 55:02.670
You're alright. Don't worry.
- Danish hospitality. A meal.

55:03.295 --> 55:05.961
I'm not gonna kidnap you.

55:07.336 --> 55:08.628
OK, yeah.

55:42.872 --> 55:45.080
Mum!

55:45.247 --> 55:46.788
Mum!

55:46.955 --> 55:48.121
Hello, you.

55:50.288 --> 55:52.371
I missed you.
- I missed you!

55:52.496 --> 55:54.620
You are late.
Where have you been?

55:55.245 --> 55:57.870
Well, this is my new friend,
Mr. Herb.

55:57.995 --> 56:00.369
This is my daughter, Krystel.
- Alright?

56:06.077 --> 56:07.118
And who is this?

56:07.243 --> 56:08.951
It's her new friend!

56:10.243 --> 56:12.951
He is staying for dinner, Mum.
So try to behave yourself.

56:13.575 --> 56:14.867
Hi.

56:36.738 --> 56:38.863
You can sit down if you want.

56:39.030 --> 56:40.279
Oh, cheers.

56:43.612 --> 56:45.029
I'll just...

56:45.195 --> 56:48.570
Is he your dog, Mr. Herb?
- No.

56:48.778 --> 56:52.153
I don't think he's got a home.
He keeps following me around.

56:58.027 --> 56:59.526
What's his name?

56:59.693 --> 57:01.776
I don't know.
He hasn't said.

57:01.943 --> 57:04.567
He has to have a name.
- You give him a name.

57:04.775 --> 57:06.817
Can I?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

57:08.941 --> 57:11.983
What are they...
What are they talking about?

57:12.149 --> 57:14.149
You.
- What are they saying?

57:14.316 --> 57:17.065
Grandma thinks you are strange.

57:17.232 --> 57:21.439
She says you're a hobo.
Probably a drug addict.

57:26.647 --> 57:30.063
Don't tell grandma,
but I'm here to rob a bank.

57:31.896 --> 57:33.188
Really.

57:36.020 --> 57:37.853
Have some more potatoes.

57:39.561 --> 57:41.478
The man is an idiot.

57:53.226 --> 57:56.434
No.
Stop giving it stuff at the table.

57:58.350 --> 58:01.225
I know.
I will call him Mistah!

58:01.391 --> 58:02.766
Yeah.

58:02.933 --> 58:05.391
After Mr. Herb! Simple!

58:05.557 --> 58:07.557
Well, that's a nice name.

58:08.473 --> 58:12.806
Can we take him down
to the beach after dinner?

58:12.973 --> 58:14.931
Dear...
- Please?

58:15.097 --> 58:18.097
It needs a walk.
- Maybe. We'll consider it.

58:25.471 --> 58:26.596
You know, Mr Herb...

58:27.429 --> 58:30.137
I'm proud of my daughter.
- Here we go!

58:30.303 --> 58:31.386
Very proud.

58:32.136 --> 58:35.802
As well as holding down a job,
she's bringing up a child.

58:36.302 --> 58:38.552
And she's studying
the hotel business.

58:38.719 --> 58:40.802
She works very hard.

58:40.968 --> 58:43.884
Her boss gives her time off
to study, which helps!

58:44.801 --> 58:48.425
It would be a shame to see it
all thrown away over some...

58:50.717 --> 58:53.091
A bum!
- He is a dinner guest, Mum.

58:53.258 --> 58:54.883
That's all very well.

58:55.008 --> 58:58.090
But you know that when you give
them an inch, they'll take a mile.

59:05.256 --> 59:07.256
It's a lovely dinner.

59:08.880 --> 59:11.630
Krystel, you and I will handle
the dishes.

59:12.588 --> 59:15.296
Why do I need to do the dishes?

59:15.463 --> 59:17.379
Because the dishwasher is broken.

59:17.546 --> 59:18.712
And because I work.

59:18.879 --> 59:21.587
Yes, and you promised
that you would get it fixed.

59:21.753 --> 59:23.628
Listen, if you'd used
the dishwasher properly,

59:23.836 --> 59:25.503
it wouldn't have broken
in the first place.

59:25.586 --> 59:27.752
I know how to use a dishwasher.
- It is one year old.

59:27.961 --> 59:29.919
Why do I need to do the dishes?

59:30.085 --> 59:32.960
Because I work.
Now bloody shut up the both of you!

59:34.251 --> 59:37.334
The dishwasher's broken
and it's the end of the world.

59:38.625 --> 59:39.667
I could fix it.

59:41.208 --> 59:42.250
Sure!

59:43.000 --> 59:44.166
Most likely.

59:44.916 --> 59:46.291
OK...

59:48.582 --> 59:50.457
And then if we

59:50.624 --> 59:51.998
give this one more...

59:52.165 --> 59:55.289
If I just... One more turn...

59:57.747 --> 59:59.289
Oh, fucking hell.

01:00:01.039 --> 01:00:03.246
OK, let's give it a try.

01:00:04.705 --> 01:00:06.204
Sorry. Sorry, mate.

01:00:06.788 --> 01:00:08.496
Okay.

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:15.203
There you go.
Thank you very much.

01:00:27.784 --> 01:00:32.117
I apologise for my mother.
She thinks that I'm... hopeless.

01:00:32.283 --> 01:00:34.075
That I will mess up everything.

01:00:34.241 --> 01:00:36.324
I don't think she likes me
that much.

01:00:36.783 --> 01:00:37.824
Really?

01:00:38.824 --> 01:00:42.115
You did fix her dishwasher.
- Let's hope it stays fixed.

01:00:53.863 --> 01:00:55.113
Stay, stay.

01:00:55.863 --> 01:00:56.988
There you go.

01:01:00.529 --> 01:01:03.028
This is cool.
- Yeah, it is.

01:01:04.195 --> 01:01:07.569
In a couple of days, bonfires
will be lit along the coast.

01:01:08.111 --> 01:01:09.902
Oh, why?
- Sankt Hans Aften.

01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:13.110
"Sans hen hafen."
- Sankt Hans Aften.

01:01:13.235 --> 01:01:15.776
Saint John, the solstice.
- Oh, I see.

01:01:15.901 --> 01:01:16.943
Everybody comes.

01:01:17.026 --> 01:01:20.067
We tell stories,
have picnics, sing songs...

01:01:20.692 --> 01:01:21.775
It's fun.

01:01:24.733 --> 01:01:26.400
I love this festival.

01:02:18.225 --> 01:02:19.974
Mr. Herb.
- Yeah?

01:02:20.099 --> 01:02:22.765
Welcome to Denmark.
- Oh, thank you.

01:02:24.599 --> 01:02:26.015
Race you!

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:47.886
It's uphill.

01:02:48.886 --> 01:02:49.969
Come on, bud.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:57.010
Go on, girl.

01:02:57.885 --> 01:02:58.968
Get up.

01:03:02.801 --> 01:03:06.133
Don't forget the trolley.
- Right, OK.

01:03:07.175 --> 01:03:08.883
Give me a second.

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:12.049
Quite hard to manoeuvre.
- I won the race.

01:03:12.632 --> 01:03:13.674
Come on.

01:03:29.963 --> 01:03:33.754
Getting her off to bed is no easy task.
She does not stop.

01:03:34.421 --> 01:03:35.670
VoilÃ !

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:40.919
Oh, she's a bright kid.
- Yeah.

01:03:43.044 --> 01:03:44.294
Do you have kids?

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.252
Yeah.

01:03:47.168 --> 01:03:49.168
One. A boy.

01:03:50.085 --> 01:03:51.126
Frankie.

01:03:51.626 --> 01:03:53.667
Francis. He's...

01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:56.042
He's not in my life
at the moment.

01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:58.208
He lives with his mother.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:01.416
That's sad.

01:04:02.083 --> 01:04:03.124
That's life.

01:04:10.456 --> 01:04:12.289
You seem very easy in your skin.

01:04:13.164 --> 01:04:14.831
Not under pressure, you know.

01:04:15.539 --> 01:04:18.455
Where I'm from
pressure's all there is.

01:04:20.538 --> 01:04:25.787
Well, in Denmark pressure's just...
different, that's all.

01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:30.911
What?
- Nothing.

01:04:36.244 --> 01:04:38.535
Do you smoke weed?
- Weed?

01:04:39.035 --> 01:04:40.368
Wacky backy.

01:04:40.493 --> 01:04:41.535
Blow.

01:04:41.618 --> 01:04:42.659
Pot.

01:04:42.784 --> 01:04:44.617
Cannabis?
- Oh, yes.

01:04:46.284 --> 01:04:47.325
Maybe.

01:04:53.616 --> 01:04:55.407
I used to jog a lot.

01:04:55.532 --> 01:04:56.990
Years ago, you know.

01:04:57.115 --> 01:04:58.324
To keep fit.

01:04:59.157 --> 01:05:00.740
You know, how you do.

01:05:00.865 --> 01:05:03.864
And I used to get stoned
before I went.

01:05:04.864 --> 01:05:07.489
Makes you paranoid.
Like someone's chasing you.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.405
I used to run
right fucking fast.

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:11.988
Fit as a fucking fiddle.

01:05:12.946 --> 01:05:15.862
You're crazy.
- Best diet ever.

01:07:03.928 --> 01:07:05.428
Some master plan.

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:41.214
Oh, hi.
- Hey, morning.

01:07:41.339 --> 01:07:42.505
Hello.

01:07:45.546 --> 01:07:48.546
Looks like a nice day.
- Yeah, it won't last.

01:07:49.046 --> 01:07:50.504
Looks like rain, I think.

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:56.545
Well, there's eggs and coffee
if you want.

01:07:56.711 --> 01:07:59.044
I think I'm gonna
head back to town.

01:08:02.085 --> 01:08:03.710
I can take you.

01:08:03.835 --> 01:08:07.293
But first we eat.
I want food, even if you don't.

01:08:21.457 --> 01:08:23.832
He's got the right idea.

01:08:33.872 --> 01:08:35.372
So, what happens now?

01:08:36.205 --> 01:08:38.912
Go back home? Is that it?
- I don't know.

01:08:41.787 --> 01:08:43.078
Well, maybe.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.203
I don't know
what I'm doing anymore.

01:08:57.993 --> 01:09:00.201
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

01:09:00.326 --> 01:09:03.950
Who's the... Who's the man
in the photograph at home?

01:09:07.325 --> 01:09:08.908
He's not here anymore.

01:09:10.241 --> 01:09:12.532
Oh, sorry.
- No worries.

01:09:14.573 --> 01:09:17.740
He died when Krystel
was only a few months old.

01:09:17.865 --> 01:09:18.906
No.

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:23.988
One night, driving home from
my mother's house, we...

01:09:26.113 --> 01:09:27.946
We got into an accident.

01:09:32.112 --> 01:09:33.819
It's OK...

01:09:36.403 --> 01:09:39.069
Every day it takes figuring out
all over again.

01:09:45.027 --> 01:09:47.777
Well, look, I best be off.
- Yeah, of course.

01:09:47.901 --> 01:09:49.818
Thanks very much.
For everything.

01:09:49.943 --> 01:09:51.984
Well, you're very welcome,
Mr. Herb.

01:09:52.067 --> 01:09:54.109
OK. Well, he's OK.
- Yeah.

01:09:54.234 --> 01:09:55.442
Well, goodbye.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:57.192
Bye.

01:10:30.436 --> 01:10:31.603
Good boy.

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.352
That's a good boy.

01:10:37.102 --> 01:10:38.435
OK, mate?

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.060
It's time to go home, I think.

01:10:42.976 --> 01:10:44.267
While I still can.

01:11:08.763 --> 01:11:10.930
I hope you have
a really good journey.

01:11:12.638 --> 01:11:14.971
Hi. Do you speak English?

01:11:15.096 --> 01:11:16.970
Yes, a little.
- OK, good.

01:11:17.095 --> 01:11:19.345
Look, this is how it is.

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:22.761
I've come to Denmark
by mistake.

01:11:22.886 --> 01:11:25.427
And I wanna go home.
- Yeah.

01:11:25.552 --> 01:11:27.719
But I haven't got money
for a ticket.

01:11:27.844 --> 01:11:30.760
So, I was hoping you might
be able to do me a favour

01:11:30.885 --> 01:11:32.468
and sort something out.

01:11:32.634 --> 01:11:35.884
Now. I just wanna go home.

01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:38.259
Just want a ticket, is all.

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:41.716
Listen.

01:11:41.841 --> 01:11:44.341
I can send you the cash.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.216
I will pay you back.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.882
No.
- And I've got my passport.

01:11:49.007 --> 01:11:51.381
Look, hang on,
it's in here somewhere.

01:11:51.506 --> 01:11:52.548
Look, I mean, no.

01:11:52.673 --> 01:11:56.131
Picture was taken a long
time ago, but it is valid.

01:11:56.214 --> 01:11:58.297
So, I...
- You know...

01:11:58.422 --> 01:11:59.463
Just...
- No.

01:11:59.547 --> 01:12:01.130
I just don't belong here.

01:12:01.213 --> 01:12:02.505
I just wanna go home.

01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:05.129
Please.
- No money, no ticket.

01:12:05.213 --> 01:12:06.337
I do have money.

01:12:07.462 --> 01:12:08.879
This is what I have.

01:12:09.878 --> 01:12:12.003
OK. Let's see.

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.794
So...
- It's not enough.

01:12:14.919 --> 01:12:16.127
No.
- No, I know.

01:12:16.252 --> 01:12:19.252
I'm sorry. No.
- Just do me a favour.

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:20.418
I can't...

01:12:21.543 --> 01:12:24.293
I can't help you.
Move up, sir, please.

01:12:24.418 --> 01:12:26.167
You can help me.
- No.

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:28.750
I cannot help you.

01:12:28.875 --> 01:12:31.917
Now take your money
and your passport and move up.

01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:33.541
Peter, could you just...

01:12:34.124 --> 01:12:36.041
It's "move on". Move on.

01:12:36.166 --> 01:12:37.207
Not up.
- What?

01:12:38.082 --> 01:12:40.207
You said... It's "move on".

01:12:40.332 --> 01:12:42.748
Oh, I don't... I don't...
- Yes.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.204
Fuck!

01:13:06.536 --> 01:13:07.577
Fuck!

01:13:25.658 --> 01:13:26.824
Fuck this!

01:13:30.657 --> 01:13:32.365
Now don't nobody fucking move.

01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:35.365
Shut up! Shut up!

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:37.073
Quiet. Quiet!

01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:39.114
Shut up!

01:13:40.072 --> 01:13:42.488
You... just give me
a ticket now.

01:13:44.613 --> 01:13:46.946
Just give me
a fucking ticket now!

01:13:49.529 --> 01:13:51.862
What's wrong
with the world?

01:13:54.445 --> 01:13:56.278
All I want
is a tiny bit of help.

01:13:58.694 --> 01:14:00.902
It's only
a bit of fucking money.

01:14:05.026 --> 01:14:08.318
Give me a ticket or I'll blow
my fucking brains out!

01:14:15.441 --> 01:14:17.108
Don't worry.

01:14:18.732 --> 01:14:20.107
It's OK, don't worry.

01:14:24.607 --> 01:14:25.815
I'm sorry.

01:14:36.313 --> 01:14:38.104
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.257
Hands up!

01:16:06.007 --> 01:16:07.631
Turn around.

01:16:07.756 --> 01:16:09.256
Check him.

01:16:18.921 --> 01:16:20.254
Let's go!

01:17:43.491 --> 01:17:44.574
Hi.

01:17:53.156 --> 01:17:54.822
I'll be damned!

01:17:55.656 --> 01:17:58.155
Tom fucking Jones.
- What the f...

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.863
You're a cop.
- Yes, I am.

01:17:59.988 --> 01:18:02.988
And you are in a grave
of fucking trouble, my friend.

01:18:07.112 --> 01:18:08.737
Come on, get out.

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:12.944
Come on.

01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:23.484
It's over here.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.316
What's up, Kristina?
Is that for me?

01:18:33.399 --> 01:18:34.441
Thanks.

01:18:47.147 --> 01:18:48.189
Sit down.

01:18:52.688 --> 01:18:53.896
So...

01:18:56.146 --> 01:18:57.645
What is going on?

01:18:59.395 --> 01:19:00.437
What happened?

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.103
You seems like
a pretty straight guy.

01:19:04.228 --> 01:19:05.353
I am.

01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:14.309
Who's these two guys?

01:19:53.345 --> 01:19:54.595
It's my son.

01:19:57.802 --> 01:19:59.052
So, where is he now?

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:07.176
He's with his mother.
He's gone.

01:20:07.301 --> 01:20:08.384
He's gone.

01:20:10.717 --> 01:20:12.550
Tell me, what is all this about?

01:20:17.757 --> 01:20:18.966
Listen, man...

01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:23.423
I'm 34 years old.

01:20:25.798 --> 01:20:27.506
I'm thirty fucking four.

01:20:28.839 --> 01:20:31.505
I've been out of work
as long as I can remember.

01:20:33.172 --> 01:20:35.046
I eat shit food every day.

01:20:37.879 --> 01:20:39.671
My own mother's ashamed of me.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:44.503
I live in a disgusting flat
beneath a mental case

01:20:44.628 --> 01:20:46.961
who plays loud music
day and night.

01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:52.585
And I have a son.

01:20:55.626 --> 01:20:56.918
I have a son.

01:21:03.833 --> 01:21:05.500
And his name is Frankie.

01:21:11.207 --> 01:21:12.957
And he ignores me.

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:18.873
And it's my own fault.

01:21:24.038 --> 01:21:25.496
But my life is shit.

01:21:30.412 --> 01:21:33.870
And I've tried hard, you know,
to make it not shit.

01:21:36.036 --> 01:21:38.453
But where I come from
there isn't a chance.

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:41.036
Not for the likes of me.

01:21:42.494 --> 01:21:45.118
So, I tried
to shake things up a bit

01:21:45.743 --> 01:21:47.785
and make change
and break circles.

01:21:57.575 --> 01:21:59.699
But all I could think about
was dying.

01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:05.407
Life became more about dying
than living.

01:22:18.113 --> 01:22:19.654
So, what happens now?

01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:30.278
Lucky for you
I have friends here.

01:22:31.194 --> 01:22:32.986
Thanks.
- I gave them my word.

01:22:34.694 --> 01:22:37.401
Told that you were not
a problem, that you...

01:22:38.151 --> 01:22:40.443
It was a big misunderstanding.
- Yes.

01:22:41.317 --> 01:22:42.567
Now, come on.

01:22:45.442 --> 01:22:47.525
Why are you doing this
for me?

01:22:48.275 --> 01:22:50.316
I don't do this for you.

01:22:52.607 --> 01:22:54.274
Seems you made a friend.

01:22:58.981 --> 01:23:00.064
Thank you.

01:23:00.648 --> 01:23:02.647
No more fucking up,
Tom Jones.

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:15.229
Hello.
- Hi.

01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:21.269
Chresten was first on the scene.
He saved my life.

01:23:21.811 --> 01:23:23.519
Really?
- Yeah.

01:23:24.311 --> 01:23:27.435
He visited me in the hospital
quite often.

01:23:28.643 --> 01:23:29.810
I think he...

01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:32.601
felt responsible somehow.

01:23:34.267 --> 01:23:37.475
You know, I was
in the hospital for a long time

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.100
and I almost died.

01:23:41.599 --> 01:23:44.432
And I was so angry,
angry with...

01:23:45.349 --> 01:23:48.598
...life,
angry with myself, just...

01:23:49.306 --> 01:23:51.931
Angry all the time.
- That's how I felt.

01:23:52.056 --> 01:23:54.806
Exactly... I mean,
it's not the same, but...

01:23:54.931 --> 01:23:56.639
It is! It is!

01:23:56.764 --> 01:23:58.930
But it takes time.

01:23:59.638 --> 01:24:00.888
Yeah.

01:24:01.013 --> 01:24:03.346
I suppose
it's just trying to find

01:24:05.012 --> 01:24:07.179
one positive thing each day,
right?

01:24:09.387 --> 01:24:10.428
Right.

01:24:19.635 --> 01:24:20.760
What's that?

01:24:26.675 --> 01:24:27.925
Seriously?

01:24:32.216 --> 01:24:33.258
It's not finished.

01:24:42.006 --> 01:24:44.756
I'm gonna go back.
I'm gonna go back home.

01:24:44.881 --> 01:24:48.005
And I'm gonna sort it out
with Frankie and then...

01:24:48.838 --> 01:24:51.463
Cos I...
And then I might come back.

01:24:53.754 --> 01:24:56.046
You might come back.
- I might, yeah.

01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:58.545
Because, I mean...

01:24:59.670 --> 01:25:01.378
There's no hills here, so...

01:25:03.836 --> 01:25:07.252
What about Mistah?
- Will you look after him?

01:25:07.377 --> 01:25:10.918
Until you get back?
- He'll forget me quickly.

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.043
I don't think so.

01:25:13.168 --> 01:25:16.334
I better come back.
- We will all miss Mr. Herb.

01:25:22.416 --> 01:25:23.666
Come on!

01:25:26.624 --> 01:25:27.665
Come!

01:25:43.038 --> 01:25:44.663
"Sankt Hans Aften."

01:25:51.203 --> 01:25:53.578
Mum, Mum! Hurry!

01:25:53.703 --> 01:25:56.702
The bonfire is being lit!
- Is it now?

01:25:57.494 --> 01:25:59.077
Are you coming?
- Yeah.

01:25:59.202 --> 01:26:00.952
Good.
- Yeah, I'll be down.
