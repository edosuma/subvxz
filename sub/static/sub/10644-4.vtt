I now pronounce you husband and wife.

00:04.952 --> 00:06.162
I got married.

00:06.163 --> 00:08.782
- Wow. Who's the lucky lady?
- Norma Bates.

00:08.783 --> 00:10.702
Why did you never mention her to me?

00:10.703 --> 00:12.810
It's not like we mentioned a
lot of things to each other.

00:12.811 --> 00:14.613
I'm Julian. What are you in for?

00:14.614 --> 00:15.870
I committed myself.

00:15.871 --> 00:18.530
I can't think about anything
but Norman right now.

00:18.531 --> 00:19.725
What if he says something wrong?

00:19.726 --> 00:23.018
Sometimes a person might
think someone needs help

00:23.019 --> 00:25.218
because they are actually
the one that needs help.

00:25.219 --> 00:26.468
Sometimes, yes.

00:26.469 --> 00:27.848
I just want you to forgive me.

00:27.849 --> 00:29.080
I don't forgive you,

00:29.081 --> 00:31.080
and I have never been so
disappointed in anyone.

00:31.081 --> 00:33.615
He's never been like this ever.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.120
He's gonna get over it.

00:36.741 --> 00:38.240
<i>I'm sure I want to do this right now.</i>

00:38.241 --> 00:41.410
I have reason to believe
that my mother is insane

00:42.492 --> 00:43.911

00:59.241 --> 01:01.873

- Norman!</i>

01:18.614 --> 01:21.244
I'll be bringing you your meds.
How was your night?

01:21.245 --> 01:22.824
How do you think, Oliver?

01:22.825 --> 01:24.994
I was locked in like a prisoner.

01:24.995 --> 01:26.954
Here you go.

Uh, I need to make a phone
call, a private one.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.889
There are no private calls.

01:31.890 --> 01:35.047
Staff always monitors.
You need to take this.

01:35.944 --> 01:40.943
Forget it, and, uh... no, I...
I don't need whatever that is.

If you refuse medication,
I can't let you leave this room

01:43.695 --> 01:45.484

in and talks to you.

to spend your morning?

01:49.485 --> 01:51.574
Yeah, no. Sor... fine.

Whoa.

Hey, come on.

Is there any way I can
make a private call here?

Uh, I-I'm fine.

Uh, listen, a lot has happened,

03:44.655 --> 03:46.944

I know I am going to be getting
out of this place today,

be there for her because...

04:04.155 --> 04:07.654

be coming to the house to talk to her.

04:11.035 --> 04:12.614
Why?

Yes, I'm okay.

04:23.445 --> 04:25.274
Dylan, this isn't about me, okay?

04:25.275 --> 04:28.774
It's about the price that we
all pay for keeping secrets.

Norman, just... look, calm down, okay?

04:31.615 --> 04:33.034
You need to calm down.

Okay, I'll be there for her.
It's gonna be okay.

No, Dylan, it isn't.

gonna fall to shit.

what's your doctor's name?

of stairs to get up here.

my legs as often as I can.

you to move, definitely.

11:38.644 --> 11:40.037
Yeah.

would go there with us?

Seriously?

11:49.814 --> 11:52.149

uproot your whole life

been with for a few weeks,

completely understand,

12:03.354 --> 12:08.143

was... that was maybe something

12:08.144 --> 12:11.723

I'm gonna go with you.

the local authorities.

13:23.985 --> 13:26.484
I'm gonna go talk about
my feelings in group.

13:48.750 --> 13:51.379
- Where are you going?
- Outside.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.549
The courtyard for patients
is off the cafeteria.

13:53.550 --> 13:54.839
You can go out there.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.049
Well, I want to go out here.

13:56.050 --> 13:58.089
- Sorry.
- You can't just say no.

13:58.090 --> 13:59.798
I'm going out the door.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.589
Luther, it's cool.

14:02.590 --> 14:04.209
I'll talk to him.

14:05.109 --> 14:07.419
Listen, don't give Luther a hard time.

14:07.420 --> 14:08.799
He's a good guy.

14:08.800 --> 14:09.839
Yeah, don't tell me what to do.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.379
Okay. Hey, hey, listen.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.249
If you want to bust out,
don't go to the front door

14:13.250 --> 14:14.549
and harass the guard, okay?

14:14.550 --> 14:15.709
They'll have you doped up

14:15.710 --> 14:17.209
and strapped to a bed in half an hour.

14:17.210 --> 14:18.709
You have to be smart.

14:18.710 --> 14:20.249
I don't want to be here.
I can't stand it.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.249
What do you know about it?

14:22.250 --> 14:23.919
Okay.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.709
I've skipped dozens of
times, Scout, all right?

14:26.710 --> 14:28.799
I mean, half the security
measures around here

14:28.800 --> 14:31.249
are because of me.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.669
I've been planning another trip.

14:33.670 --> 14:37.209
We could go tonight, if you want.

14:56.050 --> 14:58.509
This is amazing.

14:58.510 --> 15:00.231
Oh, thank you.

15:02.460 --> 15:05.749
And thank you for making Dylan so happy.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.879
I mean, where the hell
did this all come from?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.209
I don't know, Norma. It's so funny.

15:11.210 --> 15:15.550
It's like we... we finally
just saw each other one day.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.822
Yeah.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.839
Do you think Norman will understand?

15:21.840 --> 15:24.130
I know he's been dealing with a lot.

15:27.050 --> 15:29.670
Dylan's been keeping me in the loop.

15:32.090 --> 15:35.089
I think that they can help him there,

15:35.090 --> 15:37.379
and at least he's safe.

15:37.380 --> 15:39.379
Yeah, you... you're
doing the right thing.

15:39.380 --> 15:41.339
I know. I hope so.

15:41.340 --> 15:44.291
I... it doesn't feel right.
It feels scary and awful.

15:46.090 --> 15:50.049
Maybe you need to try
and let go a little.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.379
You've always been so close to Norman.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.709
Maybe this is your chance to just stand

15:52.710 --> 15:54.049
and breathe on your own

15:54.050 --> 15:56.800
and just think about yourself a little.

16:00.340 --> 16:02.210
[text tone beeps]

16:14.880 --> 16:16.209
I got your text.

16:16.210 --> 16:18.170
What do you want?

16:30.050 --> 16:31.998
I'm gonna ask you a direct question.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.250
Did you kill Bob Paris?

16:37.210 --> 16:40.049
I-I'm not gonna dignify that
with a response, Rebecca.

16:40.050 --> 16:41.919
What is it? What's your endgame here?

16:41.920 --> 16:43.879
Okay, look.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.879
I-I know that you told me
to let sleeping dogs lie,

16:45.880 --> 16:48.799
right, but...

16:48.800 --> 16:53.549
there is $3 million

16:53.550 --> 16:56.009
lying around in a safety deposit box

16:56.010 --> 16:59.496
that Bob just left behind.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.522
No one knows about it

17:03.050 --> 17:06.709
because I laundered it for him.

17:06.710 --> 17:08.980
It's under a fake name.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.208
So why tell me about it?
Why don't you just take it?

17:12.209 --> 17:14.049
I-I-I can't.

17:14.050 --> 17:17.209
Look, every safety deposit
box requires two keys.

17:17.210 --> 17:22.378
The bank... has one

17:22.380 --> 17:24.919
and the box renter holds onto the other.

17:24.920 --> 17:29.379
Now, I'm betting that Bob
doesn't have his key anymore.

17:29.380 --> 17:33.629
I think the man who killed him has it.

17:33.630 --> 17:36.549
Oh, God, we shouldn't
be talking about this.

17:36.550 --> 17:39.379
Look, Alex, I didn't know what
I was getting into with Bob.

17:39.380 --> 17:43.879
It... it was fun, but he's gone now.

17:43.880 --> 17:48.799
So this... this money
could be very useful

17:48.800 --> 17:50.169
for both of us.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.170
I-I don't have the key.

[chuckles]

17:57.010 --> 17:58.669
[clears throat]

17:58.670 --> 18:00.709
By the way, I need to open
a joint checking account

18:00.710 --> 18:02.959
with my wife, so if you could
send me the forms, okay?

18:02.960 --> 18:05.919
Her name's Norma Louise
Bates, B-A-T-E-S.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.090
Yeah, I know how to spell Bates.
