02:38.120 --> 02:39.320
What's goin' on?

02:39.400 --> 02:40.400
Take a guess.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.920
Anything happens to me,
Sugar's coming after you.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.000
You know that. He'll kill you.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.240
Sugar ain't goin' after no one.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.560
He's dead.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.400
Don't fuckin' worry.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.560
I ain't gonna make you suffer.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.560
- Dushane, you're not...
- Shut the fuck up!

03:05.400 --> 03:06.560

[car engine starts]

03:47.920 --> 03:48.880
Yo, you all right?

03:50.760 --> 03:51.760
Yeah, man.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.480
I know that had to be done,

03:56.880 --> 03:58.960
but, Dushane, that's a fuckin' big risk,

04:00.000 --> 04:01.960
takin' out our only supplier like that.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.840
Fuck that, man. We got Lizzie, innit?

04:07.520 --> 04:08.920
[Dushane] She'll come through.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.080
But you believe her?

04:14.200 --> 04:16.200
I believe she don't wanna fuckin' die.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.440
She'll come through, man.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.480
There's one ting
she gotta do for us first, though.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.920
I'm old enough to go on my own.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.600
I like taking you.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.400
Okay, fine, but don't hug me
when we get there

04:57.480 --> 04:58.760
and don't kiss me either.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.400
Definitely don't kiss me.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.400
- What do you want?
- Whoa, whoa.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.960
What kind of hello is that, bruv? Hmm?

05:33.160 --> 05:35.600

05:44.000 --> 05:45.520
I heard you had a stroke, fam.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.720
You all right, though?

05:54.040 --> 05:57.120
Bruv, I got a busy day, innit?
If you got somethin' to say, say it.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.440
Someone I know will pay a lot of money
for someone you know.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.400
Who d'you know?

06:02.440 --> 06:03.280
Modie.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.560
And you bust him out, yeah?

06:06.400 --> 06:09.200
Come on, man.
What kind of question's that?

06:10.360 --> 06:11.480
Who do I know?

06:12.720 --> 06:13.560

- [tsking]

06:24.280 --> 06:25.480
No, bruv, no.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.400
Think about it first, man, yeah?

06:29.480 --> 06:31.360
With Sully out the way,
you move up in the squad

06:31.440 --> 06:33.560
instead of sitting on
the fuckin' bench, bruv.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.080
You wanna give man Dushane
as well as Sully,

06:37.160 --> 06:39.040
man will up the P, no problem.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.080
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
Can't you see that?

06:43.760 --> 06:45.440
Yeah, I can see it, but I don't want that.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.960
No, you do want that.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.280
You're lying to yourself, man.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.560
I can see it, everyone can see it.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.800
Bruv, Sully and Dushane got theirs.
Where's yours?

06:56.760 --> 06:58.160

When you gettin' your Ps and respect?
When?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.120
I know what you're about.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.440
You wanna be a provider, yeah?

07:18.680 --> 07:20.720
You wanna provide for your little girl.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.160
What's her name again?

07:24.560 --> 07:25.560
Erin.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.520
Yeah.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.200
Listen, I'm the same, bro, yeah?

07:33.080 --> 07:36.000
Fuck all this materialistic shit, right?

07:36.960 --> 07:40.120
I'm just doin' what I can do
so I can do right by my little boy.

07:41.240 --> 07:44.360
Ain't nothin' in the world more important
to a man than his kids, right?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.440
Modie? [chuckles]

07:47.520 --> 07:48.760
Dushane? [tsks]

07:48.840 --> 07:51.840
Bruv, them man don't know that feeling,
yeah? Being a dad.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.240
That love you feel
when you hold your child, bro.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.920
When your child holds you, bro.

07:56.440 --> 07:59.760
Even Sully.
Another man's raising his yout, you know.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.520
He ain't never been there
for his daughter, has he?

08:03.480 --> 08:05.640
That's what I'm sayin', bro.
They're not like you and me.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.360
Them man are scumbags, bruv.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.120
Yeah?

08:09.760 --> 08:11.920
How you gonna give Erin
the proper childhood she deserves

08:12.000 --> 08:13.960
if you're always bottom of the pile, bro?

08:15.720 --> 08:17.720
Think about it, yeah?

08:19.080 --> 08:20.160
Call me.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.240
Don't take too long, you know,

08:23.320 --> 08:26.400
otherwise Erin might not have anyone
providin' for her at all.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.640
Yeah?

08:32.159 --> 08:33.840
[sighs] All right.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.000
[car door shuts]

08:42.039 --> 08:43.480
[car engine starts, revs]

08:52.000 --> 08:53.280
[Dushane] Pass that phone, fam.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.320
You, ring Jamie.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.080
Tell him a shipment came in,
you wanna arrange a meet.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.120
Now.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.000
Is that a problem?

09:07.440 --> 09:08.360
No.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.680
It's not a problem.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.600
Where will I tell him to meet?

09:15.680 --> 09:18.320
There's a car park on the A46.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.800
Car park won't work.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.240
We've never done a handover there before.
He'll be suspicious.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.560
It'd be safer to do it
in one of our flats.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.680
He's used to goin' to them.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.480
Neighbours.

09:33.960 --> 09:34.960
The noise.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.240
[Lizzie] All of the other units
in the building are all ours.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.280
They're all still empty.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.800
Just don't make a mess.

09:45.880 --> 09:46.800
[exhales sharply]

09:51.000 --> 09:53.120
[Kit] Blud, I thought I wasn't gonna
see you again, fam.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.840
[Jamie] You know he's madder
than what he was

09:54.920 --> 09:56.080
before he went into jail.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.160
[hip hop playing in background]

10:00.520 --> 10:01.640
So, what does he want?

10:02.400 --> 10:03.520
Everything, bro.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.280
Even the Ps we made while he was inside.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.360
Blud, I thought he would've dipped out
or somethin'.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.520
G thinks he can run the place
like he did before, innit?

10:10.600 --> 10:13.120
How's he supposed to do that with the feds
lookin' for him?

10:13.200 --> 10:14.760
His picture's everywhere, bro.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.280
Nah, bro, I don't know, man.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.760
He thinks he's invincible.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.480
Thinks he's smarter than everyone else.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.400
Fuckin' Modie, fam.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.800
G, you know we was this close.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.680
This fuckin' close
to finishin' off all of this bullshit.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.200
Findin' Dushane,
finishin' off Summerhouse.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.920
Now we got fuckin' Modie
to deal with, man. [tsks]

10:38.000 --> 10:40.320
- [mobile phone vibrates]
- [sighs]

10:44.520 --> 10:45.440
Yeah, hello?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.320
[Lizzie] Something's come in for you.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Cool.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.920
See you at the flat.
Same one as last time.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.360
All right, when?

10:59.360 --> 11:00.240
Tonight.

11:01.640 --> 11:02.520
Eleven?

11:02.680 --> 11:03.760
[Jamie] I'll be there.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.200
[Dushane] Good.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.360
And don't worry,

11:12.080 --> 11:13.880
we're gonna make a lot of money together.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.120
[Dushane] Everyone gets what they want.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.840
[sighs]

12:22.360 --> 12:23.640
[sighs]

12:27.840 --> 12:30.720
[Ms Griffiths] He didn't say anything
when you got home yesterday?

12:31.280 --> 12:32.280
[Amma] No.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.320
I will have to speak to that boy.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.240
Fighting with Stefan?

12:45.440 --> 12:47.640
I just... I don't understand it.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.640
Where's Ats now?

12:52.960 --> 12:56.240
Um, Wednesday is maths club after school.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.680
He's not there.

13:05.080 --> 13:05.920
Amma...

13:06.720 --> 13:09.160
he's missing a lot of school.

13:11.280 --> 13:15.640
Has he mentioned any new friends
that you've never seen before?

13:18.480 --> 13:19.440
No.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.520
It's not that uncommon.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.480
You know, when a child begins
to feel unsettled at home,

13:28.280 --> 13:31.080
they can become vulnerable to older boys.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.760
Kids that age are easily influenced.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.680
Attica knows better than that.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.880
A mother knows her child.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.640
Right. Come here.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.960
All right, come on, let's go.

14:13.440 --> 14:14.600
D'you reckon that's all right?

14:14.920 --> 14:15.800
[Lee] No.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.000
- No? Well...
- Yeah.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.560
[car horn honking]

14:24.200 --> 14:25.520
It's fuckin' cold.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.720
How long are we supposed
to hang round the Fields for?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.160
Till we see something
we can give Dris, something interesting.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.560
- Hopefully.
- Watch it.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.440
- [man] What'd you say?
- What?

14:33.520 --> 14:35.160
- What's up with you?
- Nothing's up with me.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.440
What you fuckin' doing here?
You shouldn't be round here.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.520
- Look at the state of you.
- I literally said nothing...

14:39.600 --> 14:41.960
- You walked into her, bruv.
- Back, bro. Who you bro-ing?

14:42.040 --> 14:43.720
- What's it gotta do with you?
- Look, calm down...

14:43.800 --> 14:45.200
- Fuck off!
- [Sarah] Oi!

14:46.480 --> 14:50.640
Listen, take your filthy junkie shit
and stay off this estate.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.400
Do you understand me?
There's kids in here.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.720
- Get off him. Leave him alone.
- Sling your fuckin' hook, you!

14:54.800 --> 14:56.160
Just relax, Sarah!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
[Lee] It's all right.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.880
Look, we're goin', all right?
We're leaving, all right?

15:02.680 --> 15:03.920
Just so you understand.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.160
Don't let me catch you round here again

15:06.240 --> 15:08.400
and don't let my fuckin' kids
catch you round here again.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.440
D'you understand me?

15:09.520 --> 15:10.600
I understand, mate.

15:10.680 --> 15:11.960
I'm going, we're going.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.640
Now fuck off.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.040
[Lee panting]

15:21.720 --> 15:22.800
You all right?

15:23.880 --> 15:24.840
Lee.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.480
I'm sick of this shit.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.280
I know.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.040
Come on.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.000
What's the matter with you?

16:03.200 --> 16:04.840
- Hello!
- Just leave me alone.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.160
'Leave me alone.'

16:06.880 --> 16:08.120
Seriously? What are you, 12?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.480
Shut up, Jaq!

16:14.280 --> 16:15.720
What the fuck is the matter with you?

16:17.360 --> 16:18.280
[tsks]

16:22.880 --> 16:24.320
Where are my energy bars?

16:29.360 --> 16:31.280
Now where the fuck are my energy bars?

16:31.600 --> 16:34.240
Ay, don't tell me you ate them.
There's literally nothing to eat.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.360
[tsks]

16:36.440 --> 16:37.800
You fucking did eat them.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.520
Fat bitch.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.000
- [Lauryn sobbing]
- [sighs]

16:46.440 --> 16:47.360
Lauryn?

16:48.120 --> 16:49.120
Wassup?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.760
[sobbing continues]

16:52.320 --> 16:53.320
Lauryn!

16:54.760 --> 16:55.920
Ay, come on, sis, man.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.680
If it's about the bars,
I don't even care. It's not that deep.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.119
Wassup?

17:06.079 --> 17:07.359
Someone done something?

17:15.400 --> 17:16.560
Tell me what's wrong.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.079
If it's a fella, I'll fix him good.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.079
You know I'll fuck him up.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.000
So is it a guy? What?

17:28.640 --> 17:29.720
So what's he done?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.440
Come on, what's he done?

17:34.920 --> 17:35.920
[Lauryn sniffles]

17:38.680 --> 17:39.640
Nothing.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.000
He's not done anything. He's dead.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.080
- What?
- He's dead, Jaq.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.560
Who's dead?
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

17:49.200 --> 17:50.960
What happened? Who is this guy?

17:52.360 --> 17:53.480
Promise you won't tell.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.480
[tsks] Who am I gonna tell?

17:58.880 --> 18:00.280
His name's Leyton.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.280
What?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.480
You mean Leyton-from-the-Fields Leyton?

18:07.400 --> 18:08.720
Oh, my God.

18:09.320 --> 18:14.000
No, look, you don't know him.
Not like I did. He was sweet.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.360
He was funny and he treated me good.
He would never hit me.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.120
He just disappeared.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.480
And his phone is just...

18:22.560 --> 18:25.040
How serious was this? You and Leyton?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.880
Ay, you didn't tell him stuff, did you?

18:28.960 --> 18:30.480
Like stuff on Summerhouse?

18:31.480 --> 18:34.480
Bruv, you know he was the one
who had a pop at Sully at the cremation.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.080
You need to tell me what you told him.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.040
Tell me! Did you tell him that Sully
was gonna be at the cremation?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.480
No, no, I don't know. No.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.800
I... I just told him stupid shit,
shit that doesn't even matter.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.000
How are you supposed to know what matters?

18:48.680 --> 18:51.560
Fuck, man! Listen, you need to tell me
whatever you told him.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.400
Tell me!

18:53.480 --> 18:55.160
I think I might have said something to him

18:55.240 --> 18:58.600
about that time Dushane asked his brother
for money, but I didn't...

18:58.680 --> 18:59.760
Fuck, man!

19:01.880 --> 19:04.040
What else? Come on, what else?

19:04.120 --> 19:06.680
Did you tell him about
Sully going to the cremation?

19:07.400 --> 19:10.920
I had no idea what they were gonna do!
I didn't know!

19:12.320 --> 19:13.840
You're fucked, you know that?

19:14.080 --> 19:15.560
You are fucked!

19:15.800 --> 19:17.160
It wasn't my fault!

19:17.240 --> 19:20.000
- So whose fuckin' fault was it then?
- What? I didn't say anything!

19:20.080 --> 19:22.560
- You never! Fuckin' thief!
- No, get off me!

19:22.680 --> 19:23.760
Listen!

19:24.120 --> 19:26.520
Stop it! No! No!

19:26.600 --> 19:28.000
[Lauryn wailing]

19:28.080 --> 19:29.720
[Jaq] Bitch! Stupid bitch!

19:29.800 --> 19:32.160
Nah, man! Fuckin' stupid bitch.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.560
- Dumb bitch! Dumb bitch!
- [Lauryn] Stop it!

19:34.640 --> 19:35.960
Jackie, please!

19:36.040 --> 19:37.520
- Pack a bag!
- Jackie, please!

19:37.600 --> 19:39.960
- Pack a fuckin' bag!
- Jackie, please!

19:40.040 --> 19:42.120
- Nah, bruv!
- Jackie!

19:42.200 --> 19:44.160
Go to a train station, bus station.

19:44.240 --> 19:47.120
I don't give a fuck
where you go to right now.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.360
You need to get as far away from here
as possible.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.080
If they find you,
you know what they'll do?

19:52.160 --> 19:53.480
They will kill you, you know that?

19:53.880 --> 19:55.040
They will shoot you dead.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.080
- Jackie, please!
- Don't fuckin' call me that!

19:58.960 --> 20:00.920
- I mean it, bruv.
- Jackie.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.320
When I get home, you need to be gone.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.120
- Don't go, Jackie.
- Nah, nah.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.280
Jackie!

20:08.360 --> 20:09.880
[sobbing]

20:11.000 --> 20:12.320
I'm sorry.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.360
[door opens]

20:16.560 --> 20:18.240
I'm sorry!

20:20.080 --> 20:21.560
[exhales]

20:29.640 --> 20:30.640
[sighs]

20:37.920 --> 20:39.200
The fuck happened to him?

20:39.400 --> 20:41.240
We sat out near the Fields
like what you told us

20:41.320 --> 20:43.080
and some random guy just started on him.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.080
Did you see anything?

20:44.160 --> 20:45.160
[Sarah] What?

20:45.240 --> 20:47.440
Did you see anything interesting
in the Fields?

20:47.520 --> 20:49.480
- No, nothing.
- Come on, let us have a hit, Dris.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.160
Take the edge off, you know what I mean?

20:51.240 --> 20:53.520
Let you have a hit for what?
You two are useless.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.960
Oh, come on. Look at his face, man.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.280
We was only there 'cause you told us to be
and look what happened to him.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.720
- Look, please, Dris.
- Don't touch me, bro.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.440
You need to give us a hit at least, man.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.360
- You ain't brought me nothing.
- [Lee scoffs]

21:06.200 --> 21:07.640
Well, where's Dushane then?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.800
We'll tell him what happened,
he'll give us a score.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.360
You ain't speakin' to Dushane.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.360
[Lee chuckles]

21:14.680 --> 21:15.520
Yo.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.600
What you sayin'?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.440
- [Dris] Give 'em one, innit?
- What, a tick?

21:23.720 --> 21:24.760
Just give it to 'em.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.240
[Sarah] Thank you.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.000
Fuck's sake.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.040
Yo.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.480
You lookin' like you
just seen a ghost, fam.

21:47.720 --> 21:48.640
What you sayin'?

21:49.040 --> 21:50.000
Bruv.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.000
Wah gwaan.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.240
What's goin' on?

21:54.000 --> 21:54.840
Wah gwaan.

21:54.920 --> 21:57.080
Is this how you man
greet a man nowadays, yeah?

21:58.000 --> 21:58.920
What's good?

21:59.200 --> 22:00.640
- We're good, man.
- Calm.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.880
- What you sayin'?
- [Modie tsks]

22:03.240 --> 22:04.480
That's a good question.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.680
Kinda disappointed still.

22:07.440 --> 22:11.280
Before I went in jail, we had Summerhouse
on the fuckin' ropes.

22:12.440 --> 22:15.320
All of a sudden, I go away... Boom.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.880
Summerhouse are runnin'
the fuckin' mandem.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.800
It's very simple.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.840
We have to wipe these man out.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.240
And we will.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.920
'Cause I'm back
and I'm runnin' the mandem properly now.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.040
Make sense?

22:32.120 --> 22:34.040
Bro, what do you mean,
you're runnin' the mandem?

22:35.320 --> 22:40.480
Like, for real, do you not understand that
every single second you're standing here,

22:40.560 --> 22:42.680
there's a chance
someone is going to see you?

22:43.280 --> 22:45.960
And there's a chance that person
could go and tell the feds you...

22:46.040 --> 22:48.480
How many fuckin' times
do I have to tell you?

22:48.560 --> 22:50.560
I don't care!

22:55.760 --> 22:56.880
Jeez.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.240
I'm hearin' that we got a new supplier
and I wanna meet him.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.080
He won't wanna meet.

23:07.960 --> 23:08.800
Strange.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.800
I didn't hear you ask him just then.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.880
He's jumpy. He won't wanna meet.

23:16.560 --> 23:20.600
Well, he's gonna be jumpin'
off the side of a fuckin' cliff

23:20.680 --> 23:21.680
if you don't organise it.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.000
Set it up, Jamie.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.040
Look, gotta go.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.040
Fleeting visit.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.560
Wanted man and such.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.920
[Modie] Say no more, yout.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.080
What are you gonna do now, bruv?

23:57.160 --> 23:58.000
Bro...

23:59.400 --> 24:00.800
I don't even know, man.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.000
Okay. Great.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.520
You got a plan.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.080
Good to know.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.040
You know we're killin' him tonight, innit?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.240
You do understand that?

24:23.280 --> 24:24.320
Yeah.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.720
I understand.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.680
And you need to be there.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.320
I know.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.800
And when he sees you,

24:33.560 --> 24:36.280
I want you to make him believe
everything is normal.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.720
Dushane, Jamie is a kid.

24:40.320 --> 24:41.520
He's out of his depth.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.240
[chuckles]

24:47.200 --> 24:48.400
If you try anything,

24:49.800 --> 24:52.280
you're gonna go the same way as him,
do you get me?

24:53.080 --> 24:54.080
I won't.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.600
[door opens]

24:56.400 --> 24:57.240
Trust me.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.080
[Jaq] Dushane!

25:00.000 --> 25:01.680
There ain't no trust in this game.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.280
You know that.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.680
I need to chat to you, fam.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.160
Go on.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.400
What's up?

25:32.080 --> 25:32.960
Talk.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.280
It's Lauryn.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.160
Fam, my fuckin' sister's a snake.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.960
What you talkin' about?

25:46.160 --> 25:47.800
She was seeing that Leyton guy.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.720
That anything she heard, she told him.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.160
Like what?

25:58.360 --> 26:00.000
Like you asking Chris for money.

26:03.880 --> 26:04.840
What else?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.640
She told him about Sully
goin' to the cremation.

26:11.600 --> 26:12.520
[scoffs]

26:13.480 --> 26:14.760
Fuckin' hell, man.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.400
I'm sorry, Dushane.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.360
I made phone calls around her
that I shouldn't have.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.120
When did she tell you this?

26:26.800 --> 26:28.960
I kicked the fuck out of her, man.
I dealt with it.

26:31.680 --> 26:32.880
I need to see her now.

26:33.080 --> 26:34.240
[Jaq sighs]

26:36.880 --> 26:37.960
Did you hear what I said?

26:38.960 --> 26:40.920
- She's gone.
- Gone where?

26:41.400 --> 26:42.520
I don't know.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.080
You need to fuckin' find her then, innit?

26:46.880 --> 26:49.840
And when you do, you let me know.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.680
Did you hear what I said?

26:55.120 --> 26:56.360
Can't do that, fam.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.400
What?

26:58.480 --> 27:01.040
You know Lauryn. She's a dickhead.

27:01.480 --> 27:04.280
She done the wrong thing.
She knows that, I know that.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.080
But that's my sister, fam.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.760
I don't give a fuck!

27:09.680 --> 27:14.160
If I tell Sully what you just told me,
and you're fuckin' protecting her,

27:14.400 --> 27:15.840
you know you're gone, innit?

27:20.640 --> 27:21.920
I can't give her up, fam.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.840
That's my blood.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.600
Ay, listen to me, and listen fuckin' good.

27:27.800 --> 27:31.040
See, after tonight, Lauryn's gonna pay
for what she did, you know?

27:32.320 --> 27:33.920
If you got any fuckin' sense,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.240
you will go and find her
before I fuckin' do,

27:37.320 --> 27:38.400
I swear down.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.360
When I tell Sully what you just told me,

27:42.120 --> 27:44.720
I ain't gonna be responsible for
what he does. Do you understand me?

27:44.800 --> 27:45.880
Now fuck off!

27:46.560 --> 27:47.520
Go on, fuck off!

27:52.400 --> 27:54.360
Fuckin' bitch!

27:55.960 --> 27:56.960
Fuck off!

28:03.120 --> 28:04.880
- [tsks]
- [mobile phone vibrates]

28:08.160 --> 28:09.560
- Yeah.
- [Shelley] I need to see you.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.880
- Look, Shelley...
- It's important.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.200
I can't right now, yeah?
I got mad stuff to do.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.280
Look, I don't care. You need to come.

28:17.720 --> 28:18.800
[call ends]

28:28.000 --> 28:28.960
[Amma] Attica.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.440
- Where are you going?
- Out.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.800
I asked you where you're going.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.680
And I said I'm goin' out.

28:39.040 --> 28:42.000
You don't have to speak to me like that.
You know I worry about you.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.920
Mum, I can look after myself
better than you do.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.240
Uh-uh! You will show some respect.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.320
I'm your mother,
and you'll do as I tell you.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.000
No, I won't! You can't make me!

28:50.440 --> 28:52.880
I said you're not going out.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.000
Get out of my fuckin' way!

30:19.760 --> 30:21.760
[distant police siren wailing]

30:44.120 --> 30:45.160
You all right?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.400
[Ats hums]

30:57.960 --> 30:59.040
Can you even do it?

30:59.680 --> 31:01.120
I'll try and do the Moonwalk, yeah?

31:01.200 --> 31:02.880
You're gonna fall down
and I'm gonna laugh.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.240
What, just 'cause I can do it
and you can't?

31:05.920 --> 31:09.280
- Watch this, watch this, watch this.
- Show me your best dance move, then.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.440
- Bruv, I'll slap the black out of you.
- No, you won't.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.960
- You sure about that, man?
- Yes, I am.

31:13.040 --> 31:13.920
Okay.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.240
[distant cheering]

31:16.320 --> 31:17.240
[Ats tsks]

31:20.880 --> 31:21.880
Aight, come on, let's go.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.000
Why are you askin' me this, fam?
You know I'm broke.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.600
It's calm. I'll pay for you still
'cause you're my guy.

31:27.680 --> 31:28.800
Safe, bruv.

31:28.880 --> 31:29.920
Come, let's go in.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.640
[Stefan] Get off my hand, man!

31:31.720 --> 31:32.920
[Ats laughs]

31:33.680 --> 31:34.760
Get off my hand!

31:35.520 --> 31:37.160
[Stefan laughs]

31:48.960 --> 31:49.920
[Ats] Hello.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.480
- Thank you.
- [Stefan] Thank you.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.800
[indistinct chatter]

32:11.200 --> 32:12.280
[Ats] Come here, man.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.840
[Stefan] I swear I can't see you, fam.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.280
[both laughing]

32:24.360 --> 32:25.760
[Stefan chattering indistinctly]

32:27.200 --> 32:28.480
[both laughing]

32:47.720 --> 32:48.760
Woo!

32:48.840 --> 32:50.360
[both laughing]

32:53.400 --> 32:55.040
[siren wailing]

33:00.120 --> 33:01.000
Aah!

33:17.080 --> 33:19.600
I want you to look me in the eye
and tell me what you're gonna do.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.160
Lauryn was here.

33:22.680 --> 33:23.600
[tsks]

33:23.680 --> 33:25.680
- For fuck's sake.
- She was all beat up.

33:26.360 --> 33:29.480
Her eye was swollen.
Her lip was busted. Her mouth was cut.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.080
She was frightened out of her mind.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.960
You need to do something.
You need to fix this.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.560
Look, man, you're askin'
for the impossible here.

33:41.360 --> 33:42.840
You know what she did, innit?

33:43.200 --> 33:44.760
Yeah? My friend nearly got killed.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.320
She didn't know that was
what Leyton was gonna do.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.360
She had no idea. She made a mistake.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.000
Yeah, a big mistake.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.280
She trusted a man.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.360
That was her mistake.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.560
Like I said,
it's a big fuckin' mistake, innit?

33:59.080 --> 34:00.400
I trust you, still.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.280
I trust you to do the right thing.

34:04.520 --> 34:05.680
[Dushane sighs]

34:06.320 --> 34:08.320
Look, if she knew that was
what Leyton was gonna do,

34:08.400 --> 34:10.000
she would've never have told him.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.040
Can you just help her, please?

34:14.760 --> 34:17.719
Dushane, she's sorry,
she... she knows she done wrong.

34:19.840 --> 34:20.840
Is she in there?

34:23.560 --> 34:25.840
No, she was too terrified.
She wouldn't stay.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.679
Why are you looking at me?
Do you wanna look?

34:31.760 --> 34:32.960
Come in and look.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.560
- Come in and look!
- [tsks]

34:37.199 --> 34:38.920
I have to tell Sully.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.320
Tell Sully?
That's signin' a death warrant.

34:41.400 --> 34:42.800
Yeah, that's not my call.

34:43.159 --> 34:46.520
You can't just get out of it like this,
pretendin' it's not your responsibility.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.120
If you see her, you need to tell me.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.000
And what happens then?

34:51.719 --> 34:53.040
She broke the rules, Shelley.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.480
My friend almost got killed.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.480
[Lauryn sniffling]

35:15.640 --> 35:17.120
[sobbing]

35:36.960 --> 35:38.960
[TV playing in background]

35:40.280 --> 35:42.680
[Abby] Do you reckon you could grow
your beard as long as that?

35:42.760 --> 35:45.440
[Aaron] Why would I get my beard like that
and look like I'm homeless?

35:46.080 --> 35:47.080
Hi, Stef.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.440
- [Stefan] Hi.
- Yo.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.320
Aaron...

35:51.280 --> 35:52.680
when is Jamie gonna come home?

35:53.680 --> 35:55.800
Fam, how many times you gonna ask me that?

35:55.880 --> 35:57.760
I don't know.
He comes home when he comes home, innit?

35:59.600 --> 36:00.880
Come sit with us, Stef.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.440
Come on.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.640
Come on, man. There's room.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.280
[Abby] Come on. We've got popcorn.

36:09.800 --> 36:10.920
[sighs]

36:15.480 --> 36:17.960
Come watch. Covers. There you go.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.840
Wait. So, what, you give him the blanket,
you don't give it to me?

36:21.920 --> 36:24.440
- Get your foot off me as well.
- [Abby] Go on. Put your feet up there.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.680
Kick off your shoes. That's it!

36:26.760 --> 36:27.600
[Stefan] Comfortable?

36:27.680 --> 36:29.360
- Hey, your feet stink, man.
- No, they don't.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.000
- What's wrong with you?
- They don't stink. Ah!

36:33.120 --> 36:35.120
- What movie is this?
- [Abby] I have no idea.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.800
- [Aaron] Some new ting that came out, man.
- Looks like Aaron.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.880
- [Abby laughs]
- [Aaron] How? How's that look like me?

36:39.960 --> 36:41.680
- Same beard.
- [Abby laughs]

36:42.360 --> 36:44.280
[Abby] You reckon you could
grow yours like that?

36:45.120 --> 36:47.360
- It's coming, it's coming.
- [Abby laughs]

36:47.920 --> 36:50.200
[door opens, shuts]

37:06.960 --> 37:08.520
[removes clip from gun]

37:15.640 --> 37:17.200
[Dushane] I was in Jamaica with nothing.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.480
You was in jail with nothing.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.840
Don't act like you know what I did
or what I didn't have in jail.

37:25.680 --> 37:28.160
You put no money on my fuckin' books,
did you?

37:28.240 --> 37:31.240
Fuckin' hell, man. I'm just sayin', innit,
we come a long way,

37:31.760 --> 37:33.000
and we're nearly there.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.960
Hey, I'll tell you what
I did have in jail.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.640
My own fuckin' room.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.680
Stop moaning, man.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.240
It was warmer than this.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.240
I went to see Taylor the other night.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.800
She's got this new guy, Paul.
She's gettin' married.

37:54.680 --> 37:55.800
Bought a house.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.240
Nice house. Mortgage, everything.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.240
[Sully chuckles]

38:02.480 --> 38:03.520
Did you see Tash?

38:03.920 --> 38:04.880
Mm.

38:05.680 --> 38:06.720
She's good, man.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.920
They're good, they're happy.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.040
You know when you can just tell.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.240
So, what you sayin'?

38:18.040 --> 38:20.080
You want a piece
of Taylor's life now, yeah?

38:20.560 --> 38:21.520
[Dushane] Hm?

38:21.600 --> 38:22.800
What you laughin' at?

38:22.880 --> 38:25.920
I'm laughin' 'cause, like, you wanna
be like this guy Paul or somethin'.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.600
You prick. [chuckles]

38:28.520 --> 38:29.720
Listen to me, bruv.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.280
You ain't that.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.240
We ain't that.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.000
We ain't never gonna be that.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.480
You said it yourself, this is you and me.

38:39.640 --> 38:40.720
This is us.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.920
Ain't gonna be no cosy nine-to-five,

38:44.440 --> 38:46.640
no fuckin' nice little house
with a picket fence

38:46.720 --> 38:49.200
and all of that comfortable shit, bruv,
it ain't happenin'.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.880
- I'm tellin' you.
- What, you can't see me in a office, no?

38:53.600 --> 38:54.880
Fuck no.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.600
- [Sully chuckles]
- [scoffs]

38:57.040 --> 38:58.720
Unless you're fuckin' stickin' it up.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.920
[laughs] What you talkin' about?

39:04.480 --> 39:06.040
No, serious though, man.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.000
If you had that life, bruv, you'd hate it.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.520
You know that.

39:11.440 --> 39:12.720
Yeah, I probably would.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.360
We've taken out Haze,

39:17.480 --> 39:18.800
taken out Sugar.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.520
Couple of hours,
we're gonna take out Jamie.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.920
Then we're back on top.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.480
For now.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.000
We'll win this war,

39:30.080 --> 39:31.560
I have no doubt about that.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.400
Just sayin', there'll be another one,

39:37.520 --> 39:39.000
and some other guy to war with.

39:39.960 --> 39:43.680
Then we'll be back in this shithole again,
or somethin' like it.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.720
And again and again and again.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.440
That's how the streets go,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
till it's our turn to lose the war,
I guess.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.200
Lose?

39:57.240 --> 39:58.200
Nah.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.600
I ain't gonna like
when you talk like that, bruv.

40:02.680 --> 40:05.960
No one ain't gonna have the balls
to come near us after this, bro.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.080
And if they do,
we're gonna fuckin' wipe them out.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.160
We've been climbin' this fuckin' mountain,

40:15.400 --> 40:16.840
and we're nearly at the top.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.320
This fuckin' close.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.760
Then we're gonna be running
everything again.

40:25.560 --> 40:26.760
A whole empire.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.240
[Sully laughs]

40:29.320 --> 40:30.320
What?

40:30.600 --> 40:32.640
Ah! If you knew how many times

40:32.720 --> 40:35.160
you fuckin' told me
about this empire of yours.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.640
- [Dushane laughs]
- Ugh!

40:38.800 --> 40:39.680
Oh, shit.

40:39.760 --> 40:42.080
I know I've gassed, I know
I've gassed a couple of times now.

40:42.160 --> 40:43.360
A couple times?

40:43.960 --> 40:46.280
You need me to come tonight?
Back you lot up?

40:49.160 --> 40:50.040
Nah.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.320
[sniffles]

40:52.920 --> 40:54.720
You're good, man, you can go still.

40:54.960 --> 40:58.440
Fam, you don't know how many man
Jamie might have with him.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.680
We got it covered.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.160
You don't want him to come?

41:13.240 --> 41:14.520
Don't want him to have a fit.

41:16.120 --> 41:17.200
- [Sully sighs]
- Fucked up.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.640
[Sully] You know better than me.

41:19.400 --> 41:20.280
That's true.

41:22.600 --> 41:23.760
[Dushane] But, listen,

41:23.840 --> 41:26.320
we need to make sure that woman
don't get hurt tonight, you know.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.400
But I'm more worried about...

41:29.760 --> 41:31.240
her thinkin' she can play us.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.720
[tsks] Bruv, she can try.
She ain't gonna get fuckin' far.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.120
- You wanted to see me, fam.
- You good?

41:40.200 --> 41:41.240
[Jaq] Yeah, yeah good.

41:41.920 --> 41:42.920
Laters.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.560
- Just wait out the back for me, yeah?
- [door shuts]

41:49.680 --> 41:50.520
Aight, cool.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.680
[Dushane] I'm just sayin', bro.

41:55.720 --> 41:58.360
At least we got a plug that won't
run around killin' man's family

41:58.440 --> 41:59.560
and that now, innit?

41:59.640 --> 42:01.720
I'm just sayin', don't underestimate her.

42:08.120 --> 42:08.960
Mm.

42:22.160 --> 42:23.920
Did you tell anyone what you told me?

42:24.280 --> 42:25.280
No.

42:27.560 --> 42:29.680
I have to tell Sully.
You know that, innit?

42:29.880 --> 42:31.080
Yeah, I know.

42:31.160 --> 42:33.320
And you know what he's gonna do
when I tell him.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.000
She's already gone.

42:36.640 --> 42:37.880
No, she ain't left.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.800
- She's at Shelley's.
- Fuckin' stupid...

42:40.880 --> 42:42.440
Yo, yo, hold it down.

42:46.360 --> 42:47.760
Go and see her tonight.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.040
Tell her to get out and don't come back.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.200
I'm gonna tell Sully in the mornin'.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.080
If she's still here, it's on you.

42:57.040 --> 42:57.960
I'll tell her.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.280
Give her that.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.080
[Dushane] She's gonna need
as much as she can get.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.960
- If Sully hears about this...
- He won't.

43:25.400 --> 43:26.520
[sighs]

43:32.480 --> 43:33.520
[sighs]

43:34.960 --> 43:37.200
[siren wailing]

43:43.720 --> 43:45.560
Bruv, hurry up, man. Let's bounce.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.840
Lizzie's not on this waiting thing, fam.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.960
- What you sayin'? Everything pattern?
- Yeah, yeah.

43:55.960 --> 43:57.040
Cool, then let's move.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.800
[Kit sighs] Bruv.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.080
[car approaching]

44:15.680 --> 44:16.600
[Jermaine] Bruv!

44:18.360 --> 44:19.640
- Get in.
- [Jamie] What?

44:20.280 --> 44:23.120
Are you deaf, bruv? Get in. Just you.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.320
G, what do you want, fam? What's goin' on?

44:29.160 --> 44:30.040
Get in the car.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.600
Bruv, I'm being real, fam.
This is bad timing.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.480
- I got shit I need to do.
- [Modie] Hm.

44:35.560 --> 44:38.280
I hear you. But trust me.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.480
I got somethin' you don't wanna miss,
so...

44:42.280 --> 44:44.280
get in the fucking car.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.760
[footsteps approaching]

45:09.080 --> 45:11.320
I reckon we should leave
in about half an hour, fam.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.520
[Dushane] What we sayin'?
How you wanna do this?
