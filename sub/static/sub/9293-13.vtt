00:11.434 --> 00:14.701
Bomb!
(explosion thunders)

00:20.434 --> 00:22.900
Vice President Daniels
is running this country now.

00:22.967 --> 00:25.867
He will implement
your security plan.

00:25.934 --> 00:28.234
Agent Lowry, these men
are responsible for

00:28.301 --> 00:30.301
the attempted assassination
of the president.

00:30.367 --> 00:32.833
WOMAN:
 <i>I have the Vice President</i>
 <i>calling for Mr. Buchanan.</i>

00:32.900 --> 00:35.501
DANIELS:
 <i>Bill, I see</i>
 <i>from the White House flashes</i>

00:35.568 --> 00:37.934
that President Palmer
granted Charles Logan

00:38.000 --> 00:39.267
some kind of furlough.

00:39.334 --> 00:41.367
Logan claims he can help us find
Dmitri Gredenko.

00:41.434 --> 00:43.134
DANIELS:
 <i>How?</i>

00:43.201 --> 00:44.934
BUCHANAN:
 <i>Through the Russian consulate</i>
 <i>in Los Angeles.</i>

00:45.000 --> 00:46.334
LOGAN:
The bomb
that exploded

00:46.401 --> 00:48.833
this morning was a Russian
suitcase nuclear device

00:48.900 --> 00:51.867
supplied to the terrorists
by Dmitri Gredenko.

00:51.934 --> 00:54.201
 <i>Where is he?</i>

00:54.267 --> 00:56.634
I don't know.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.167
(phone ringing)
Yes?

00:58.234 --> 00:59.401
MARKOV:
The United States

00:59.467 --> 01:02.167
has connected you
with terrorists.

01:02.234 --> 01:04.601
The reason we brought
the Arabs into this

01:04.668 --> 01:07.034
was to conceal our involvement.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.334
Now we are exposed.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.833
Russia is exposed.

01:09.900 --> 01:12.668
Jack, you just spent nearly
two years in a Chinese prison

01:12.733 --> 01:14.733
because you violated the
sovereignty of their consulate.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.501
Now you plan to go back
into the Russian consulate

01:17.568 --> 01:19.700
and take a chance
on that happening again?!

01:21.234 --> 01:23.134
BAUER:
 <i>How do I find Gredenko?!</i>

01:23.201 --> 01:26.668
M-Mojave Desert.

01:26.733 --> 01:28.100
Shadow Valley.

01:28.167 --> 01:29.334
What is he doing?

01:29.401 --> 01:31.367
Launching drones.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.501
How soon will the drones
be ready?

01:35.568 --> 01:39.767
In two hours, all the bombs
will be in the air.

01:41.634 --> 01:42.601

02:31.668 --> 02:34.568
I've got to set the transcript
codes for the debrief.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.967
Thank you.

02:46.201 --> 02:48.134
Who are you?

02:48.201 --> 02:49.833
I'm just Chloe O'Brian.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.900
I-I need to do something
on this computer.

02:51.967 --> 02:54.134
Do you know what's going on
with Jack Bauer?

02:54.201 --> 02:56.501
As far as I know,
he's still being held

02:56.568 --> 02:57.833
in the Russian consulate.

02:57.900 --> 03:01.100
I need to talk
to Bill Buchanan right now.

03:01.167 --> 03:03.067
He'll be here after
his meeting.
Does he know

03:03.134 --> 03:05.067
that I'm all alone here
in a holding cell?

03:05.134 --> 03:10.134
This isn't really a cell,
and you're hardly alone.

03:10.201 --> 03:11.668
This is standard procedure

03:11.733 --> 03:13.934
for someone who's
under house arrest.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.833
Excuse me?
Sorry.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.534
I-I'm feeling ambivalent.
I'm gonna go.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.767
All right, I want to introduce
everyone to Mike Doyle.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.534
He's the new head
of Field Ops,

03:29.601 --> 03:31.967
just in from Fort Bragg.
I want all

03:32.034 --> 03:35.201
tactical and comm agents
to report to him directly.

03:35.267 --> 03:36.601
Jack Bauer's currently
being held captive

03:36.668 --> 03:37.767
in the Russian consulate.

03:37.833 --> 03:39.167
I haven't opened up
that information

03:39.234 --> 03:40.267
to anyone on
the outside.

03:40.334 --> 03:41.301
Doyle will help you

03:41.367 --> 03:43.568
put a tactical
profile together

03:43.634 --> 03:45.134
for an assault
on the consulate.

03:45.201 --> 03:46.634
MILO: So, we're
permitted

03:46.700 --> 03:48.134
to provoke an
international incident

03:48.201 --> 03:50.301
just to liberate one
of our own operatives?

03:50.367 --> 03:52.234
No. Liberating Jack
is a secondary goal.

03:52.301 --> 03:55.234
Our primary objective is to
abduct Anatoly Markov,

03:55.301 --> 03:56.867
the consul. Now,
according to Jack,

03:56.934 --> 03:58.867
Markov knows how
to find Gredenko,

03:58.934 --> 04:00.668
who controls the remaining
three suitcase nukes.

04:00.733 --> 04:01.900
Excuse me, but is nobody worried

04:01.967 --> 04:03.401
that this could be considered
an act of war

04:03.467 --> 04:04.501
against the Russians?

04:04.568 --> 04:05.934
BUCHANAN:
Ultimately,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.134
it's the vice president's
decision if we go in or not.

04:08.201 --> 04:10.100
But, if Jack
is right,

04:10.167 --> 04:12.301
and Markov is working
with Gredenko,

04:12.367 --> 04:13.833
the Russians will
have to back down.

04:13.900 --> 04:16.000
Sir, Logan is ready
for you.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.233
Thank you.

04:17.301 --> 04:20.201
I want a comprehensive siege
profile on my desk ASAP.

04:22.167 --> 04:25.034
Who has the control keys
for the main servers?

04:25.100 --> 04:26.900
Uh, I do.
Okay, bracket the
scenarios into three.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.100
I want projected
outcomes based on

04:29.167 --> 04:30.267
different levels
of personnel.

04:30.334 --> 04:31.767
MILO:
Doyle, normally,
we run general

04:31.833 --> 04:33.534
attack assessment first,
then if there's any...

04:33.601 --> 04:35.534
I don't care what
you normally do, Pressman.

04:35.601 --> 04:37.234
And I wasn't
speaking to you.

04:37.301 --> 04:39.067
I was talking with her.

04:39.134 --> 04:40.334
MILO:
Yeah, that's so weird,

04:40.401 --> 04:42.401
'cause I had this thought
that you might come here

04:42.467 --> 04:46.167
and not be a jerk, like you were
in Denver, but you are.

04:46.234 --> 04:47.367
That's right.

04:47.434 --> 04:48.733
Just like Denver.

04:50.301 --> 04:52.134
Let's get to work.

04:53.967 --> 04:55.100
I take it
you know him?

04:55.167 --> 04:56.367
Yeah.

04:56.434 --> 04:57.767
I don't like him very much.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.767
Does he know
what he's doing?

04:59.833 --> 05:02.401
Yeah, he's good.

05:06.034 --> 05:07.601
What did Buchanan say?

05:07.668 --> 05:09.301
We're ready to move
on the consulate,

05:09.367 --> 05:10.467
pending White House approval.

05:10.534 --> 05:11.601
Is Jack on his own?

05:11.668 --> 05:12.900
Yeah.

05:12.967 --> 05:15.967
This is all about getting
Markov, not saving Jack.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.100
Yeah?

05:36.501 --> 05:38.800
I'm terminating the American.

05:38.867 --> 05:41.301
Do you confirm?
Yes.

05:41.367 --> 05:44.900
And you're sure there won't be
any political complications?

05:44.967 --> 05:47.234
Not if we stick to our story.

05:47.301 --> 05:49.234
The American kills
our head of security,

05:49.301 --> 05:51.100
tries to escape.

06:13.668 --> 06:15.601
The American has shot Vasili.

06:15.668 --> 06:17.501
He's in the basement.
Find him!

07:02.900 --> 07:04.000
AGENT:
Consul Markov?

07:04.067 --> 07:05.234
Yes.

07:05.301 --> 07:07.100
We haven't found the American,

07:07.167 --> 07:08.733
but I locked down
the perimeter.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.601
There is no way
to leave the building.

07:10.668 --> 07:13.201
He can't be allowed to call out.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.367
Shut down the phone lines,
DSL, everything.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.401
CTU. O'Brian.

07:34.467 --> 07:35.467
Morris, it's Jack.

07:35.534 --> 07:37.733
I know how to find Gredenko.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.967
He's in the...
(dial tone)

07:39.034 --> 07:40.134
Morris?

07:40.201 --> 07:43.900
Jack? Jack? Jack!

07:43.967 --> 07:45.234
(dial tone)
Come on!

07:47.067 --> 07:48.467
Damn it!

08:08.867 --> 08:10.800
Sir, Morris just
got a call from Jack.

08:10.867 --> 08:12.800
The line went dead
before he could finish,

08:12.867 --> 08:14.700
but he says he knows
where Gredenko is.

08:14.767 --> 08:15.967
Did he trace
the call?

08:16.034 --> 08:17.167
He's still inside
the consulate.

08:17.234 --> 08:18.634
All right, monitor
everything in case

08:18.700 --> 08:21.134
he calls back, and tell
Doyle Bauer's got key intel,

08:21.201 --> 08:22.401
and is no longer
dispensable.

08:22.467 --> 08:24.301
Got it.

08:33.167 --> 08:34.433
I'm sorry.

08:34.501 --> 08:36.400
We're going to have
to reschedule our debrief.

08:36.467 --> 08:37.933
Why?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.167
We have an immediate situation
at the Russian consulate.

08:40.234 --> 08:41.933
Does this have something to do

08:42.000 --> 08:44.601
with Bauer going
back in there to
question Markov?

08:44.668 --> 08:46.167
Please, Bill.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.467
Maybe I can help.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.700
Jack was able
to get Grendenko's location

08:56.767 --> 08:57.867
from Markov.

08:57.934 --> 08:59.967
He tried to call us,
but was cut off

09:00.034 --> 09:01.367
before he could say more.

09:01.434 --> 09:03.467
He's either being held prisoner
in the consulate,

09:03.534 --> 09:05.201
or he's being pursued.

09:05.267 --> 09:07.067
Then I was right.
Markov is involved.

09:07.134 --> 09:10.034
And he will do whatever it
takes to keep Jack quiet.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.934
We have to
extricate Jack,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.967
and failing that,
we have to go in

09:14.034 --> 09:15.833
and remove Markov
and interrogate him ourselves.

09:15.900 --> 09:18.501
We don't have time to
go through the red tape.

09:18.568 --> 09:20.267
There's not gonna be
any red tape.

09:20.334 --> 09:21.534
I'm launching an assault team.

09:21.601 --> 09:23.367
No, that's... that
is a huge mistake.

09:23.434 --> 09:25.467
Markov will not let
himself be taken alive,

09:25.534 --> 09:27.067
and he will
kill Jack Bauer.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.401
We have to try something.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.568
We're running out of options.

09:30.634 --> 09:32.534
Have you tried any pressure
from the top?

09:32.601 --> 09:34.301
From-From President Suvarov?

09:34.367 --> 09:36.134
Vice President Daniels
has spoken to Suvarov.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.367
He's reluctant to act.

09:37.434 --> 09:39.334
It's a diplomatic standoff.

09:39.401 --> 09:41.568
He needs to be convinced
to get involved.

09:41.634 --> 09:43.700
I don't know
how to do that.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.833
I do.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.767
How?

09:50.833 --> 09:52.334
My ex-wife, Martha.

09:52.401 --> 09:54.334
She became friends
with the Suvarovs,

09:54.401 --> 09:56.867
especially the wife.

09:56.934 --> 09:58.434
Anya can get through to Yuri.

09:58.501 --> 09:59.833
He listens to her.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.900
They're a very good team.

10:03.568 --> 10:05.867
Um, with all due respect,

10:05.934 --> 10:07.967
hasn't Mrs. Logan
been institutionalized?

10:08.034 --> 10:09.367
That's beside
the point.

10:09.434 --> 10:12.334
She's in a unique position
to help us.

10:14.467 --> 10:17.000
All right. I'll-I'll...
put a call in to her.

10:17.067 --> 10:20.501
Bill, let me do it.

10:20.568 --> 10:23.034
Martha can be
very difficult.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.267
I think it would be best
if I talked to her.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.367
I didn't realize
you were on speaking terms.

10:28.434 --> 10:31.568
We're not, but I think
I can get through to her.

10:31.634 --> 10:33.201
I know I can.

10:33.267 --> 10:35.401
Please, let me try.

10:37.601 --> 10:39.568
That's the
way I want it.

10:39.634 --> 10:41.401
How many on each
of those teams?

10:41.467 --> 10:42.601
Five.

10:42.668 --> 10:43.967
Okay, make it three.
More teams,

10:44.034 --> 10:45.568
more area covered.
Fine.

10:45.634 --> 10:47.867
Who's estimating the
consulate defense figures?

10:47.934 --> 10:49.700
That would be me.

10:49.767 --> 10:52.301
Where are the numbers?
I'm just sorting them
before I put them out.

10:52.367 --> 10:53.467
Of course you are.

10:53.534 --> 10:54.634
Where are the numbers?

10:54.700 --> 10:56.401
Oh, I see. This is
about whether or not

10:56.467 --> 10:57.733
it takes eight seconds
or ten seconds.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.100
There are your numbers
sorted three ways. Pick one.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.067
Hey!

11:06.000 --> 11:07.668
Do I have your attention?
'Cause I only want

11:07.733 --> 11:09.267
to do this once.

11:11.167 --> 11:12.534
I have 25 soldiers

11:12.601 --> 11:15.134
that are about to put
their asses on the line.

11:15.201 --> 11:16.501
Whether they live or die

11:16.568 --> 11:18.334
largely depends
on what gets done here.

11:18.401 --> 11:19.800
That's not to mention

11:19.867 --> 11:21.634
the larger threat
of three nuclear weapons

11:21.700 --> 11:24.267
that may be down the street,
for all we know.

11:24.334 --> 11:26.800
So, if anyone has a problem
taking orders from me

11:26.867 --> 11:29.100
without giving me lip,
tell me now,

11:29.167 --> 11:31.568
and I will have you reassigned.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.501
Doyle.

11:42.568 --> 11:45.201
You keep your hands
off my people.

11:45.267 --> 11:46.634
Is that clear?

11:46.700 --> 11:48.800
DOYLE:
They need to understand
what I expect from them.

11:48.867 --> 11:50.034
MILO:
I know what you expect.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.434
That's all
that matters.

11:51.501 --> 11:53.867
You have a problem with somebody
on my team, you come to me.

11:53.934 --> 11:55.967
Fair enough.

11:56.034 --> 11:58.100
Have your "team"
merge their results

11:58.167 --> 12:00.134
and download it onto my system.

12:04.467 --> 12:06.401
You all right?

12:06.467 --> 12:09.634
The shirt's a blend;
it doesn't wrinkle.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.134
You know what I mean.

12:12.334 --> 12:14.267
Yes.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.301
I am all right.

12:17.568 --> 12:20.201
I thought I was a
pain in the ass.

12:22.767 --> 12:24.334
The Vice President
likes you, Tom.

12:24.401 --> 12:26.201
He hopes you have the right
answer for him.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.234
Well, I hope so, too.

12:30.067 --> 12:32.867
Tom Lennox, man of the hour.

12:34.367 --> 12:35.401
It's all right.

12:35.467 --> 12:37.467
You can leave us alone.

12:40.733 --> 12:45.201
So, have you given any thought
to our earlier conversation?

12:45.267 --> 12:46.367
Yes, I have, sir.

12:46.434 --> 12:47.501
And?

12:47.568 --> 12:48.767
And I agree

12:48.833 --> 12:51.900
that the priority here is
to protect our country.

12:51.967 --> 12:54.367
And I am prepared

12:54.434 --> 12:58.067
to look the other way
regarding details

12:58.134 --> 13:00.601
of the assassination plot.

13:00.668 --> 13:02.601
To a point.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.234
Well, what does that mean?

13:06.301 --> 13:08.767
It means the truth must
ultimately come out.

13:08.833 --> 13:11.700
Reed and Carson need to be
punished for what they did.

13:11.767 --> 13:14.668
And they will.

13:14.733 --> 13:18.800
Look, all I'm trying to do is
keep America united.

13:18.867 --> 13:21.267
I can't have our critics
screaming,

13:21.334 --> 13:22.934
"Look at how bad we are.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.167
We're worse than
the terrorists."

13:25.234 --> 13:29.100
We need to keep our eye
on the ball right now.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.034
And on that point, sir,
we are in complete agreement.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.100
Good, because I need you

13:33.167 --> 13:35.568
to tell the ambassador
of Assad's country

13:35.634 --> 13:38.900
that you saw Assad plant the
bomb that injured the president.

13:42.534 --> 13:44.534
Sir, looking the other way is
one thing,

13:44.601 --> 13:45.934
choosing to tell a lie

13:46.000 --> 13:48.568
to the ambassador,
that becomes

13:48.634 --> 13:49.733
a matter of record.

13:55.733 --> 13:58.601
Now, you listen to me:

13:58.668 --> 14:01.067
If we expect to navigate
through this crisis,

14:01.134 --> 14:02.900
I need you to cooperate.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.467
Yes, and I would
like to cooperate.

14:04.534 --> 14:06.967
I'm still talking!

14:10.867 --> 14:12.833
Come on, now, Tom,

14:12.900 --> 14:15.301
let's just count our blessings
here for a minute.

14:15.367 --> 14:17.367
President Palmer survived
this awful attack.

14:17.434 --> 14:20.301
And neither you
nor I had anything to do

14:20.367 --> 14:22.167
with this heinous plot
to kill him.

14:22.234 --> 14:23.668
And the most

14:23.733 --> 14:25.100
beautiful fact of all is

14:25.167 --> 14:27.167
that we now have
the opportunity

14:27.234 --> 14:28.934
to implement
the correct policy

14:29.000 --> 14:32.867
to stop these terrorist
lunatics.

14:34.934 --> 14:37.833
Can you just put
aside your distaste 

14:37.900 --> 14:41.800
for my methods
for one minute...

14:41.867 --> 14:43.334
and think about
the great gift

14:43.401 --> 14:45.034
that's been given
to us.

14:46.334 --> 14:49.267
I will think long and hard, sir.

14:49.334 --> 14:50.367
Good.

14:50.434 --> 14:55.267
Now, I need you
to tell the ambassador

14:55.334 --> 14:58.401
that Assad carried
in the bomb.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.767
I'll take it from there.

15:02.634 --> 15:04.767
(chuckles):
Okay?

15:07.733 --> 15:09.967
Okay.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.534
Lisa, get the ambassador
clearance and bring him

15:12.601 --> 15:14.334
down here.

15:14.401 --> 15:16.301
Let DOJ know

15:16.367 --> 15:18.301
that Lennox has been
cleared of any wrongdoing

15:18.367 --> 15:22.067
and will continue serving
as Chief of Staff.

15:22.134 --> 15:24.100
Yes, sir.

15:24.167 --> 15:25.401
(sighs)

15:25.467 --> 15:28.067
Sir, I would like to know
what you hope to achieve

15:28.134 --> 15:30.568
in your talk
with the ambassador.

15:30.634 --> 15:32.067
I want him to know

15:32.134 --> 15:34.000
that I hold his country

15:34.067 --> 15:37.334
responsible for all of it--

15:37.401 --> 15:40.467
the nuke and the presidential
assassination attempt.

15:40.534 --> 15:42.134
They need
to be motivated

15:42.201 --> 15:43.867
to reign in
these terrorists.

15:43.934 --> 15:45.201
And I want them to know

15:45.267 --> 15:48.234
that America is mad as hell
and ready to retaliate

16:05.534 --> 16:07.501
--Here's Fayed.

16:11.768 --> 16:13.100
It's about time
he got here.

16:13.167 --> 16:14.800
We need to start
loading the bombs.

16:37.634 --> 16:38.933
Mr. Vice President.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.100
Bill, you're on speaker.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.301
I'm here with Tom Lennox.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.933
What's going on
at the Russian consulate?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.467
Jack Bauer's still at large
and somewhere inside.

16:45.534 --> 16:47.467
It appears he now also knows
Gredenko's location,

16:47.534 --> 16:49.100
but isn't able
to get it to us.

16:49.167 --> 16:51.234
All right, then what's the plan?

16:51.301 --> 16:52.768
Former President Logan
believes

16:52.833 --> 16:54.167
he can convince
his ex-wife

16:54.234 --> 16:56.634
to put a call
into Anya Suvarov.

16:56.701 --> 16:59.100
He thinks the Russian
First Lady can get through

16:59.167 --> 17:01.501
to her husband.
(chuckles)

17:01.567 --> 17:04.099
That's about as likely
as the terrorists knocking

17:04.166 --> 17:05.567
on my door
and surrendering.

17:05.634 --> 17:07.300
I agree.

17:07.367 --> 17:10.267
That's why we've also
prepared a siege plan.

17:10.334 --> 17:11.768
A strike force will enter
the consulate

17:11.833 --> 17:13.900
and extract Markov
for interrogation.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.534
You realize an attack

17:15.601 --> 17:18.534
on a Russian consulate is
technically an act of war.

17:18.601 --> 17:19.667
I do, sir.

17:19.733 --> 17:21.099
Frankly, I'm reluctant

17:21.166 --> 17:22.401
to go the tactical
route here.

17:22.467 --> 17:24.034
We got our hands full
with these terrorists,

17:24.099 --> 17:26.300
we don't need to open up
another front with the Russians.

17:26.367 --> 17:27.534
Of course,
it's your decision, sir.

17:27.601 --> 17:28.634
I understand the politics

17:28.701 --> 17:30.000
are sticky,

17:30.067 --> 17:32.601
but my responsibility is
to stop these nukes.

17:32.668 --> 17:35.267
Markov will not surrender
willingly.

17:35.334 --> 17:37.267
We have to go in.

17:37.334 --> 17:39.534
How long will it take you
to put together this siege?

17:39.601 --> 17:41.867
About 20 minutes.

17:43.967 --> 17:45.701
All right.

17:45.768 --> 17:46.967
Proceed as if you're going in.

17:47.034 --> 17:49.467
If Logan can be
effective

17:49.534 --> 17:51.000
before then, great..

17:51.067 --> 17:52.267
but don't wait on him.

17:52.334 --> 17:53.634
Yes, sir.

17:53.701 --> 17:55.701
You ready?
Yes.

17:55.768 --> 17:57.701
All right, take your team
to their first location,

17:57.768 --> 17:59.668
and await our word.
Got it.

18:12.833 --> 18:15.334
Martha, I'm back.

18:18.768 --> 18:20.601
Did you get some rest?

18:20.668 --> 18:22.701
I've been worried
about you.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.768
Worried about me?

18:24.833 --> 18:25.933
You shouldn't be out
driving around

18:26.000 --> 18:27.367
with all that fallout
in the air.

18:27.434 --> 18:29.367
Well, I'm keeping
a good distance away.

18:29.434 --> 18:30.933
How are you?

18:31.000 --> 18:35.534
Well, I've decided to read
my book and listen to music.

18:37.034 --> 18:39.900
I've lived with enough fear
over the years.

18:39.967 --> 18:41.334
I don't need anymore.

18:41.401 --> 18:43.367
Good for you.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.933
Got your magazines.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.867
Thank you.

18:48.933 --> 18:52.734
And I stopped by Mel's.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.900
(gasps)

18:53.967 --> 18:55.100
Did you get raspberries?

18:55.167 --> 18:58.601
(gasps)
And blackberries
and fresh kiwi.

18:58.668 --> 19:02.200
Oh, oh, thank God for Mel.

19:02.267 --> 19:05.367
What would I do without
that man's produce?

19:06.434 --> 19:09.467
Oh, these look
beautiful.

19:09.534 --> 19:11.933
Mmm.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.167
Ooh, here-- have one.

19:13.234 --> 19:14.534
I'm fine.

19:14.601 --> 19:15.967
Come on.

19:18.034 --> 19:20.534
Hmm?

19:24.067 --> 19:25.567
Can you get that?

19:29.601 --> 19:32.067
Martha Logan's bungalow.

19:34.134 --> 19:36.401
May I speak to
Martha, please?

19:36.467 --> 19:37.933
Who is this?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.634
It's Charles, Aaron.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.434
Please put her on;
it's important.

19:42.501 --> 19:44.434
Hold on.

19:44.501 --> 19:46.501
Who is it?

19:46.567 --> 19:47.768
It's Charles.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.334
He says
it's important.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.334
Important to whom?

19:58.434 --> 20:00.234
Mr. Logan, she doesn't want
to talk to you.

20:00.301 --> 20:01.900
I heard what she said.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.134
Look, listen to me,
I'm in CTU in Los Angeles.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.401
I'm here on government business

20:05.467 --> 20:07.967
and it has to do
with the nuclear attack.

20:08.034 --> 20:09.768
I don't understand how Martha

20:09.833 --> 20:11.234
could possibly be
of any help.

20:11.301 --> 20:13.534
What you understand
really doesn't matter.

20:13.601 --> 20:16.234
I no longer have to tolerate
your sarcasm.

20:16.301 --> 20:18.701
Please, this was not sarcasm.

20:18.768 --> 20:20.034
Something needs to be done.

20:20.100 --> 20:23.134
And, and I think that Martha
might be able to help.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.534
I don't know what to
tell you, Mr. Logan,

20:25.601 --> 20:27.800
but Martha simply doesn't
want to speak with you.

20:27.867 --> 20:29.867
She hasn't taken your
calls in almost two years.

20:29.933 --> 20:31.768
I don't know why you
think she would now.

20:31.833 --> 20:33.234
Tell her
it's about the Suvarovs.

20:33.301 --> 20:34.301
What?

20:34.367 --> 20:35.601
Just do it.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.100
Please.

20:39.167 --> 20:42.267
Martha, he wants to ask you...

20:42.334 --> 20:43.900
I told you.

20:43.967 --> 20:45.467
I don't want to talk to him.

20:45.534 --> 20:47.501
It's about the Suvarovs.

20:49.734 --> 20:52.234
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

20:52.301 --> 20:53.634
I don't know.

20:53.701 --> 20:55.401
(sighs)

20:57.833 --> 20:58.867
What is it?

20:58.933 --> 21:00.000
Is Anya okay?

21:00.067 --> 21:02.567
Anya's fine, Martha.

21:02.634 --> 21:03.833
They're both fine.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.867
Then what the hell do you want?

21:07.933 --> 21:10.167
It's a very delicate matter.

21:10.234 --> 21:13.000
There's an international
incident brewing

21:13.067 --> 21:16.267
and I think that you might
be able to help defuse it.

21:16.334 --> 21:18.000
Let me get this straight:

21:18.067 --> 21:19.501
The government is desperate

21:19.567 --> 21:21.401
so they come to you
to fix the world...

21:21.467 --> 21:25.467
and, uh, then you come to me.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.768
I can't be dragged in another
drama, with you Charles.

21:28.833 --> 21:29.900
I won't.

21:29.967 --> 21:31.301
You know what's going on
today, Martha.

21:31.367 --> 21:32.367
You know that this is

21:32.434 --> 21:33.668
important!

21:34.734 --> 21:37.534
This is absurd.

21:44.467 --> 21:46.301
You still there?

21:46.367 --> 21:47.534
Yes, I'm still here.

21:47.601 --> 21:49.301
Aaron, you know
I wouldn't be playing games

21:49.367 --> 21:50.467
on a day like today.

21:50.534 --> 21:52.634
I know.

21:54.701 --> 21:56.334
You need to convince her
to see me.

21:56.401 --> 21:58.067
I'm going to take a chopper
to you

21:58.134 --> 21:59.833
and I'll be there
in a few minutes.

22:04.401 --> 22:06.501
Aaron?

22:06.567 --> 22:08.800
All right.

22:28.767 --> 22:30.467
--This is Shavers.

22:30.533 --> 22:32.234
BUCHANAN:
Stan, let me talk to Logan.

22:32.301 --> 22:34.301
Sir, it's Mr. Buchanan.

22:36.201 --> 22:38.201
Yes, Bill?

22:38.268 --> 22:39.934
We've dispatched personnel
to prepare for an assault

22:40.001 --> 22:41.700
on the Russian consulate.

22:41.767 --> 22:45.334
Bill, attacking the consulate
is a huge error in judgment.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.067
This has been decided.

22:47.134 --> 22:50.001
The only way to avoid full-out
confrontation with the Russians

22:50.067 --> 22:53.334
is for you can get Martha to
make the call before we engage.

23:11.268 --> 23:14.301
(woman speaks Russian,
then giggles)

23:15.567 --> 23:18.533
(man speaks Russian,
woman laughs)

23:24.901 --> 23:26.001
Slowly...

23:26.067 --> 23:28.268
both of you against the wall.

23:28.334 --> 23:29.800
Please don't hurt her.

23:29.867 --> 23:30.967
I have no intention
of hurting

23:31.034 --> 23:32.201
either of you.

23:32.268 --> 23:34.167
But if you don't cooperate,
I will kill you.

23:34.234 --> 23:36.734
You understand me?
Both of you speak English?

23:36.800 --> 23:38.134
Yes.

23:38.201 --> 23:40.368
I need to make
an outside call.
You can't.

23:40.433 --> 23:42.334
They've cut all
communications
from the building

23:42.400 --> 23:43.567
because you
killed Stovich.

23:43.634 --> 23:45.001
I didn't kill Stovich.

23:45.067 --> 23:46.533
I don't believe you.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.433
I don't have
to convince you.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.967
We'll do
whatever you want.

23:50.034 --> 23:51.400
In case of
an emergency,

23:51.467 --> 23:53.567
how do you contact
the outside world?

23:53.634 --> 23:56.034
Please, there's a
SATCOM phone upstairs.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.500
Get it and bring it down here.

23:57.567 --> 23:59.167
We're in the middle
of a lockdown.

23:59.234 --> 24:01.400
That's your problem.
Get me that phone.

24:01.467 --> 24:03.301
Now!
Okay.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.034
Get against the desk.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.767
Don't be scared.

24:16.834 --> 24:19.433
You'll be fine.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.934
Hello, Aaron.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.834
Martha's waiting for you.

24:55.901 --> 24:57.634
She's inside.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.667
Thank you.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.600
Martha?

25:17.167 --> 25:19.134
I'll get her.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.034
What's the matter?

25:46.101 --> 25:48.368
Apparently she's
changed her mind.

25:48.433 --> 25:50.334
I'm sorry, but she doesn't
want to see you.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.167
Aaron...

25:52.234 --> 25:55.001
you have to convince her
that this is not about us.

25:55.067 --> 25:56.634
This is for the good
of the country.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.034
I told her that.

25:58.101 --> 25:59.967
Look, if we don't do something
in the next few minutes,

26:00.034 --> 26:02.301
there's going to be a U.S.-
led assault on the Russian

26:02.368 --> 26:03.700
consulate here
in Los Angeles.

26:03.767 --> 26:05.234
On top of everything else,

26:05.301 --> 26:08.467
we will effectively
be at war with Russia.

26:08.533 --> 26:10.134
MARTHA:
You've lost weight.

26:18.268 --> 26:20.567
Martha.

26:22.067 --> 26:25.201
So this is the new,
improved Charles Logan.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.368
Reborn.

26:31.567 --> 26:34.667
You look beautiful.

26:41.234 --> 26:43.201
What do you want?

26:44.301 --> 26:47.201
I need you to call Anya Suvarov.

26:47.268 --> 26:48.767
What do you want
me to say to her?

26:48.834 --> 26:50.800
She has to
convince Yuri

26:50.867 --> 26:52.268
to order the
Russian Consul

26:52.334 --> 26:55.734
General, here in Los Angeles,
to surrender himself.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.567
And why would he do that?

26:57.634 --> 26:59.867
Because the man--
his name is Anatoly Markov--

26:59.934 --> 27:01.600
he's a criminal and he's working

27:01.667 --> 27:03.967
outside of Russian authority.

27:04.034 --> 27:06.433
So what?
He's also a
mass murderer.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.500
The bomb that went off
this morning in Valencia

27:08.567 --> 27:10.368
was supplied to the terrorists

27:10.433 --> 27:11.767
with Markov's help.

27:11.834 --> 27:14.067
There are other
bombs out there.

27:14.134 --> 27:15.734
He knows where they are.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.567
Why doesn't the White House
just contact Yuri directly?

27:20.634 --> 27:22.667
They did. It didn't work.
Why not?

27:22.734 --> 27:24.201
Martha, this is
very complicated.

27:24.268 --> 27:25.901
Please don't
make me explain

27:25.967 --> 27:28.400
everything in details--
we don't have much time.
Oh, oh, oh...

27:28.467 --> 27:31.433
I'm sorry; just do what
you say without asking.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.567
I'm sorry.
You haven't changed a bit.

27:34.634 --> 27:36.800
Look at this. Look at this!

27:36.867 --> 27:38.334
I'm still under arrest.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.268
After this is over,
I go back to prison.

27:40.334 --> 27:43.101
I'm just trying to help.

27:43.167 --> 27:44.433
Prison?

27:44.500 --> 27:46.268
Is that what you call
a 10,000-square-foot

27:46.334 --> 27:49.167
house with a swimming
pool and tennis court?

27:50.767 --> 27:52.667
Yuri has to be convinced
that this man Markov

27:52.734 --> 27:54.301
 is a traitor to his country.

27:54.368 --> 27:57.433
Anya can make
our case for us.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.101
You're the only person
who can reach her fast.

28:06.500 --> 28:09.234
Do you think I should do this?

28:13.500 --> 28:15.433
Yes, I do.

28:26.134 --> 28:28.567
I need a drink.

28:28.634 --> 28:30.600
(tense, wry laugh)

28:32.201 --> 28:34.167
Not that knocking me
off the wagon

28:34.234 --> 28:35.734
would be a small price to pay

28:35.800 --> 28:38.700
for saving the world.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.167
Get Anya on the phone.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.067
--NADIA:
How far are you from
the Russian consulate?

29:03.134 --> 29:04.334
We'll be there in a few minutes.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.234
Has there been any
change of plans?

29:06.301 --> 29:07.500
No.
As far as I know,

29:07.567 --> 29:09.433
the assault on the consulate
is still a go.

29:09.500 --> 29:10.500
I'm about to talk
to Buchannan now.

29:10.567 --> 29:12.134
Call me if anything changes.

29:12.201 --> 29:13.901
Okay.

29:16.967 --> 29:19.301
Have a seat,
Mr. Ambassador.
Thank you.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.734
How is President Palmer?

29:25.800 --> 29:27.500
Well...

29:27.567 --> 29:29.500
The President's a tough man.

29:29.567 --> 29:31.634
He's injured,
but we're confident

29:31.700 --> 29:32.934
he'll make a full recovery.

29:33.001 --> 29:35.967
What a tragic and
despicable act.
I agree.

29:36.034 --> 29:37.734
What makes it even
more troubling

29:37.800 --> 29:39.901
is that a citizen of your
country, Hamri Al-Assad,

29:39.967 --> 29:42.301
was responsible for the
assassination attempt.

29:42.368 --> 29:45.301
I understand that Assad
lost his life in the blast.

29:45.368 --> 29:47.600
But I was led to believe
that he was working

29:47.667 --> 29:50.134
with President Palmer
to promote a peace plan.

29:50.201 --> 29:51.967
Well, I'm
afraid that was

29:52.034 --> 29:53.700
all a ruse, Mr. Ambassador.

29:53.767 --> 29:55.600
Assad's real
intentions

29:55.667 --> 29:57.934
became clear when he
detonated the explosive.

29:58.001 --> 30:01.634
You have proof of this?
Conclusive.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.533
Forensic evidence, as well as
at least one eyewitness

30:04.600 --> 30:07.001
who saw the detonator
in Assad's hand

30:07.067 --> 30:09.334
immediately before
the explosion.

30:10.867 --> 30:12.167
Isn't that right, Tom?

30:13.901 --> 30:15.867
Yes, sir, that is correct.

30:17.934 --> 30:20.734
Even if what you say is true,

30:20.800 --> 30:22.700
you must know
that Hamri Al-Assad

30:22.767 --> 30:25.634
was not working at the behest
of our government.

30:25.700 --> 30:28.634
He was as much a wanted man in
our country as he was in yours.

30:30.700 --> 30:33.500
Oh, not as much.

30:33.567 --> 30:35.533
But that's
gonna change.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.634
What are you referring to?

30:37.700 --> 30:40.467
The terrorists presently on
U.S. soil are acting

30:40.533 --> 30:43.134
under the orders of citizens
in your country

30:43.201 --> 30:44.433
who have the support
of your government.

30:44.500 --> 30:45.700
I know it and
you know it.

30:45.767 --> 30:48.533
That is simply not true.
I say it is.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.201
And I'm willing to bet you
that I'm right.

30:51.268 --> 30:52.533
What do you mean?

30:52.600 --> 30:55.533
I have a carrier group
within striking distance

30:55.600 --> 30:58.567
of every major city
in your country,

30:58.634 --> 31:00.567
waiting for me
to give the order.

31:00.634 --> 31:01.700
You would attack us?

31:01.767 --> 31:03.201
Abu Fayed, a citizen
of your country,

31:03.268 --> 31:06.268
enters the United
States and detonates

31:06.334 --> 31:09.167
a nuclear bomb,
killing thousands.

31:09.234 --> 31:12.334
Next, Assad attempts to
assassinate the president.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.667
We cannot be held responsible.

31:14.734 --> 31:17.867
You know fully well that
we have cooperated with you

31:17.934 --> 31:19.301
since the inception
of this crisis.

31:19.368 --> 31:21.700
These threats against us are
reckless and counterproductive.

31:21.767 --> 31:23.767
I had an understanding
with your president.

31:23.834 --> 31:26.034
And now you're going
to have one with me.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.800
You help us find those nukes
before another goes off...

31:30.867 --> 31:32.867
or I'm going to unleash
the full power

31:32.934 --> 31:34.967
of our military on your country.

31:38.268 --> 31:40.533
All right, keep me posted.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.134
Doyle is approaching
the staging area.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.400
We can in the consulate
in less than 15 minutes.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.167
It's going to come right
down to the wire.

31:46.234 --> 31:47.600
What do you mean?

31:47.667 --> 31:50.800
Charles, Logan and I are trying
to arrange a phone call between

31:50.867 --> 31:52.901
his ex-wife Martha
and Anya Suvarov.

31:52.967 --> 31:54.400
When?

31:54.467 --> 31:56.101
Mrs. Suvarov's giving a speech
right now in Omsk.

31:56.167 --> 31:57.567
We have to wait till
she's finished.

31:57.634 --> 31:59.433
Even if Mrs. Logan can
get through to Anya,

31:59.500 --> 32:00.901
it's going to take her some time

32:00.967 --> 32:02.567
to convince her husband
to change his mind.

32:02.634 --> 32:05.834
I agree.
It's a long shot.

32:05.901 --> 32:07.268
It shouldn't take much longer.

32:07.334 --> 32:08.533
LOGAN:
I don't understand.
This is important.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.268
Why don't they just interrupt
her speech?

32:10.334 --> 32:12.800
It's Russian politics.
There's nothing we can do.

32:12.867 --> 32:14.567
Fine.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.201
It's gonna be
a few more minutes.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.368
PIERCE:
What's the matter, hon?

32:24.433 --> 32:27.368
This is taking forever.
I know.

32:29.201 --> 32:32.201
Aaron... you promise
you'll stand by me,

32:32.268 --> 32:33.967
even if I can't
go through with this?

32:34.034 --> 32:35.834
Of course I will.

32:35.901 --> 32:37.800
Martha, I'm sorry.

32:37.867 --> 32:39.834
The last thing
I wanted to do

32:39.901 --> 32:41.368
was upset you.

32:42.867 --> 32:44.734
Funny, you always
manage to get

32:44.800 --> 32:47.034
to that <i>last</i> thing.

32:50.700 --> 32:51.934
Let me ask you
something, Charles.

32:54.001 --> 32:55.467
Does it bother you

32:55.533 --> 32:57.700
to see me with another man?
Martha, please.

32:57.767 --> 33:01.001
We may as well talk
to fill the time.

33:01.067 --> 33:04.034
We never really had any closure.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.533
Well?

33:07.600 --> 33:11.167
Yes. It's very difficult.

33:11.234 --> 33:13.433
If you want to know the truth.

33:13.500 --> 33:16.334
But you've had a rebirth.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.467
You should be happy
for my happiness.

33:18.533 --> 33:20.867
I am happy for you, Martha.

33:24.067 --> 33:25.767
I'm sure you are.

33:30.234 --> 33:32.134
You know, Charles,

33:32.201 --> 33:35.001
Aaron has taken
such good care of me.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.201
I don't know
what I did to deserve

33:38.268 --> 33:40.234
such a good man.

33:41.567 --> 33:43.368
I never knew
what that was before.

33:43.433 --> 33:46.067
A really <i>good</i> man.

33:46.134 --> 33:47.901
Martha, if it makes you
feel better to insult me,

33:47.967 --> 33:49.201
please feel free.

33:49.268 --> 33:51.001
I didn't come here
to fight with you.

33:51.067 --> 33:53.368
It does make me feel better.

33:53.433 --> 33:55.867
I can say exactly I want,
finally, without having

33:55.934 --> 33:57.467
to worry about
incurring your wrath.

33:57.533 --> 33:59.967
The great Charles Logan.

34:00.034 --> 34:01.433
The President of the Universe.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.301
The great leader.
The murderer.

34:03.368 --> 34:06.034
Martha, I want you
to stop this right now.

34:06.101 --> 34:07.767
You're going to get
all stirred up.

34:07.834 --> 34:09.333
Oh, well, God,

34:09.400 --> 34:10.699
we couldn't have that, could we?

34:10.766 --> 34:12.533
(knife clatters)

34:16.734 --> 34:18.268
Mr. Logan,

34:18.333 --> 34:19.934
if you'd be more
comfortable

34:20.001 --> 34:21.667
waiting outside,
I'd understand.

34:21.734 --> 34:22.900
I appreciate that, Aaron,

34:22.967 --> 34:24.766
but I think
I'll stay right here.

34:33.001 --> 34:34.433
Actually, I'm very thankful

34:34.500 --> 34:36.500
that you've been able
to be here for Martha.

34:38.368 --> 34:39.699
You <i>are</i> a good man.

34:39.766 --> 34:41.433
She's very lucky to have you.

34:44.301 --> 34:46.400
Now you're trying to
irritate me, aren't you?

34:46.467 --> 34:49.600
No, Martha, no.
I'm not.

34:49.667 --> 34:52.234
Oh, cut the crap.

34:52.301 --> 34:54.467
With the sincerity,
the new

34:54.533 --> 34:56.400
enlightened soul.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.268
At least you used
to be an honest crook.

34:58.334 --> 34:59.734
PIERCE:
That's enough.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.034
Please.

35:01.101 --> 35:03.533
Sorry.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.400
I'll be a good little girl.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.400
(Martha yells)

35:19.467 --> 35:21.334
Oh, my God.

35:27.867 --> 35:30.101
We need a medic
in here right now!

35:30.167 --> 35:33.067
He just wouldn't
stop and I, oh, oh...

35:33.134 --> 35:34.800
Oh, my God, what did I do?
You must've hit an artery.

35:34.867 --> 35:36.667
Agent Foley, get in here now!

35:36.734 --> 35:38.500
Somebody, come on!

35:38.567 --> 35:40.167
Martha, look what
you've done!

35:53.467 --> 35:54.601
--MEDIC:
He's going in to shock.

35:54.667 --> 35:55.934
Let's get him out of here.

35:56.001 --> 35:58.001
Now.

36:03.334 --> 36:05.001
PIERCE:
It happened too fast, Bill.

36:05.068 --> 36:06.701
I couldn't stop her.

36:06.767 --> 36:08.767
BUCHANAN:
There's nothing we can
do about it, Aaron.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.267
Right now, I've been ordered
by the vice president to send

36:10.334 --> 36:13.167
an assault team into
the Russian consulate, unless

36:13.233 --> 36:15.667
President Suvarov intercedes.
I understand.

36:15.734 --> 36:17.300
Is Martha capable of having

36:17.367 --> 36:19.801
a coherent conversation
with Anya Suvarov?

36:20.867 --> 36:22.634
Honestly, I don't know.

36:22.701 --> 36:25.100
Chloe's putting the call through
any second. Find out.

36:25.167 --> 36:26.267
Will do.

36:33.434 --> 36:35.767
Why are they
doing this to me?

36:35.834 --> 36:37.133
I should be given a medal.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.734
He was one of the biggest
criminals in history.

36:39.801 --> 36:41.968
They gave him house arrest.

36:42.034 --> 36:45.068
Martha, we're still
in a crisis situation.

36:45.133 --> 36:46.834
Are you able to handle

36:46.901 --> 36:49.068
a conversation
with Anya Suvarov?

36:49.133 --> 36:51.734
Of course, I am.
I'm not crazy.

36:51.801 --> 36:54.068
I know what the stakes are.

36:54.133 --> 36:56.500
Are you sure?

36:57.567 --> 36:59.500
AGENT:
Mr. Pierce,

36:59.567 --> 37:01.267
CTU's got Anya Suvarov

37:01.334 --> 37:03.567
on the line
for Mrs. Logan.

37:03.634 --> 37:05.100
They're putting
it through now.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.567
Do you know what
you're going to say?

37:14.334 --> 37:16.100
Anya, it's Martha.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.634
How are you?

37:17.701 --> 37:18.968
I'm fine.

37:19.034 --> 37:20.601
I've been worried about you

37:20.667 --> 37:22.300
there in California.

37:22.367 --> 37:24.801
Stop worrying;
everything's gonna be fine.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.867
I know we have a lot
to catch up on,

37:26.934 --> 37:29.968
but I'm going to have
to be rude and get
right to the point.

37:30.034 --> 37:31.701
There's not a lot of time.

37:31.767 --> 37:32.934
What is it?

37:33.001 --> 37:34.534
If you've talked
to Yuri recently,

37:34.601 --> 37:36.667
you know there's a very
tense situation going on

37:36.734 --> 37:39.601
at the Russian consulate
in Los Angeles.

37:39.667 --> 37:41.734
I've heard something about that,
but don't know the details.

37:41.801 --> 37:44.034
The details are
very important, Anya.

37:44.100 --> 37:46.934
Please, tell me more.

38:20.100 --> 38:23.400
The Americans stepped
on Russian soil

38:23.467 --> 38:26.200
and took me hostage.

38:26.267 --> 38:27.867
We will sort out
the details later.

38:27.934 --> 38:29.734
Right now, I am ordering you

38:29.801 --> 38:31.367
to surrender to the Americans

38:31.434 --> 38:34.233
and deliver Jack Bauer,
unharmed.

38:36.934 --> 38:39.367
I am afraid...

38:39.434 --> 38:41.068
I cannot do that,

38:41.133 --> 38:42.701
Mr. President.

38:42.767 --> 38:44.601
How dare you disobey
a direct order.

38:44.667 --> 38:46.801
You will do exactly
as I tell you!

38:46.867 --> 38:48.068
(phone beeps off)

39:02.968 --> 39:04.467
Mr. Buchanan,

39:04.534 --> 39:06.867
Consul Markov is
not cooperating.

39:06.934 --> 39:08.233
You understand,
Mr. President,

39:08.300 --> 39:10.167
this leaves me
with very few options.

39:10.233 --> 39:12.734
I do.

39:12.801 --> 39:15.300
I will personally
authorize the use of force

39:15.367 --> 39:17.233
against the consulate.

39:17.300 --> 39:19.634
The United States
of America has the support

39:19.701 --> 39:21.901
of the Russian state
in this matter.

39:21.968 --> 39:23.334
Thank you,
Mr. President.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.367
(phone beeps off)

39:30.534 --> 39:32.133
I got it.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.834
Get over here.

39:36.034 --> 39:38.867
Is anybody gonna
notice this missing?

39:38.934 --> 39:40.334
In a few minutes, yes.

39:40.400 --> 39:44.400
Make your call.
Did he hurt you?

39:44.467 --> 39:45.634
No.

39:45.701 --> 39:46.801
(phone beeps)

39:46.867 --> 39:48.867
It needs the unlock code.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.367
Get down.

40:03.467 --> 40:04.567
(chamber clicks)

40:07.901 --> 40:10.068
BUCHANAN (on phone):
Doyle, Suvarov just
gave us the go-ahead.

40:10.133 --> 40:11.434
DOYLE (quietly):
Go!

40:36.634 --> 40:38.400
(chamber clicks)

40:40.100 --> 40:41.767
(gun clatters)

40:59.001 --> 41:01.267
Are you hit?
No.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.834
(phone ringing)
Yes?

41:07.901 --> 41:10.001
It's Markov.
The Americans are coming in.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.100
I thought you had
that under control.

41:12.167 --> 41:13.667
No. Won't be long
(distant gunfire)

41:13.734 --> 41:14.834
before they have your position.

41:14.901 --> 41:16.734
Hold them off as long
as you can.

41:16.801 --> 41:17.901
I will.

41:17.968 --> 41:19.734
But you must launch now.

41:21.133 --> 41:22.500
Drop your weapon!

41:26.834 --> 41:28.500
My name is Jack Bauer.

41:28.567 --> 41:30.634
This man needs medical
attention. They're not hostiles.

41:30.701 --> 41:32.901
Okay, send medics
to the basement. I'm Mike Doyle.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.834
You need to contact
Bill Buchanan.

41:34.901 --> 41:36.267
Tell him that Fayed
and Gredenko

41:36.334 --> 41:38.634
are in the Shadow Valley.
Patch me in with Buchanan.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.434
This drone is ready to launch.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.968
Arm the bomb.

41:55.767 --> 41:57.167
Got it.

41:57.233 --> 41:59.467
Put all the satellite coverage
we have on Shadow Valley.

42:15.534 --> 42:16.934
Sir, stay still.

42:17.001 --> 42:18.667
We'll have you
to the hospital in a minute.

42:19.734 --> 42:22.233
Martha...
Sir,

42:22.300 --> 42:23.334
please don't try to talk.

42:29.233 --> 42:30.567
He's starting to crash.

42:35.100 --> 42:36.467
We're losing him.
