AT WATER PRESSURE IN EXCESS

IT'S BASIC FARTOLOGY.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.453
- WHY CAN'T YOU TELL THEM
THEY SOUND GOOD?

01:59.520 --> 02:01.489
OR THANK THEM
FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK?

02:01.555 --> 02:05.626
- SHOWING THANKS
IS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.862
AND BESIDES, YOU DON'T
HEAR THEM THANKING ME.

02:08.929 --> 02:12.233

- THERE IS NO WAY
I WOULD HAVE EVER SAID--

03:05.286 --> 03:06.654
[recorder beeps]

03:06.720 --> 03:09.056
KELLY, I'LL FIND SOMEONE

03:27.675 --> 03:29.142
all:
WE'LL MANSION-SIT FOR YOU.

03:29.277 --> 03:32.746
- OH, YOU WANT ME
TO LET THE MONKEYS MANSION-SIT?

03:32.813 --> 03:34.648
- YEAH, I THOUGHT
WE WERE DOGS.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.149
- YOU'RE MONKEY DOGS.

03:36.284 --> 03:40.354
AND THE ANSWER IS NO.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.356

JUST CALM DOWN.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.790
ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS GET THE STAIN OFF THE COUCH,

12:02.856 --> 12:03.991
FIND THE CAT,

12:04.057 --> 12:05.859
AND RAISE THE DISCO BALL.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.897
- HOW DID AN ALLIGATOR
GET IN HERE?

12:43.964 --> 12:46.299
- I OPENED THE BACK DOOR
TO LET THE SMOKE OUT,

12:46.366 --> 12:48.101
AND IT CRAWLED IN
FROM GUSTAVO'S MOAT.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.402

13:04.251 --> 13:05.752
SO GUSTAVO
DOESN'T KILL US.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.154
- CALL THE FBI.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.588

13:08.655 --> 13:11.324
THE FBI ONLY

13:26.406 --> 13:28.441
NOW, THERE'S ONLY
THREE POSSIBLE PLACES

13:28.508 --> 13:29.977
THE CAT COULD BE HIDING.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.045
ONE, HE'S ROAMING
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.914
