00:48.320 --> 00:49.599
Ow.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.306
Are you OK?

00:51.600 --> 00:52.839
Here, hold this.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.159
Honey, I'm, I'm driving.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.344
Just hold it.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.359
Hey, that's my jam.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.319
All right.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.150
Say something.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.239
This is not safe.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.424
That's good. Keep talking.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.199
I'm not... what do
you want me to say?

01:12.200 --> 01:14.519
Just keep talking.
I got to adjust these levels.

01:14.520 --> 01:17.319
One, check one.

01:17.320 --> 01:20.079
Ah, brr...

01:20.080 --> 01:22.759
Ma made me mash my M & M's.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.183
That's good. Keep going.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.079
Uh, this is... check one.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.439
My boyfriend is a big idiot.
Check one.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.239
Yeah, yeah, yeah. More.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.599
And, here we go again.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.159
That's it.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.639
And, I don't feel safe driving around
this mountain like this, babe.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.719
No, that's great. Keep going.

01:39.720 --> 01:46.679
Uh, it's the cradle of life,
the center of civilization.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.479
Men have fought for
it, even died for it.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.159
What is that?

01:50.160 --> 01:53.559
One might say it's the most
powerful thing on earth,

01:53.560 --> 01:56.479
so come on, ladies,
show it a little love.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.199
Cleansing Washing Cloths
from Summer's Eve.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.399
Hail to the V.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.159
That's great.
What, what is that from?

02:03.160 --> 02:04.839
It's a douche commercial
I didn't get.

02:04.840 --> 02:05.759
You didn't get that?

02:05.760 --> 02:06.679
Yup.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.999
Oh, man.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.878
I'm surprised. That was really good.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.719
Thanks, babe.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.519
You would, you could have
been the next douchiest

02:12.520 --> 02:15.319
spokesperson in the world.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.359
- You're really funny, you know that?
- Thank you.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.359
You think my vagina is dirty?
Is that what you're saying?

02:20.360 --> 02:24.439
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's a dirty V.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.199
- Really?
- You have a dirty V.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.779
Have I ever told you how dirty
your penis is, your cock?

02:30.780 --> 02:33.439
Uh, thank you. No, baby,
you have a porcelain V.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.959
Your V is spotless.

02:34.960 --> 02:35.919
That's more like it.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.070
Yup, you're welcome.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.471
Action.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.279
Are you going to,
are you going to say, "Action"?

02:47.280 --> 02:48.799
Don't do, don't do that.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.479
That's going to mess me up.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.559
OK.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.869
It doesn't make any
sense at all, but...

02:57.480 --> 02:59.639
Hi. I'm Jim Kessel.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.199
I'm here at the Trinity
National Forest along Route 96,

03:03.200 --> 03:06.599
also known as, "The Bigfoot Byway."

03:06.600 --> 03:08.999
I'm here with my girlfriend,
Kelly Monteleone,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.199
where we plan on
re-tracing the famed

03:11.200 --> 03:17.382
1967 Patterson-Gimlin footage
in our search for Bigfoot.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.159
What's that face?

03:20.160 --> 03:21.999
Just, it's your thing.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.719
Just make it about you, you know,

03:24.720 --> 03:27.119
no girlfriend, my name, all that.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.319
You don't want to be in
the movie and now you're,

03:29.320 --> 03:31.079
you're Stanley fucking Kubrick.
That's good.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.264
Oh. Oh, OK.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.679
Hi. I'm Jim Kessel.

03:36.680 --> 03:40.359
I'm here at Trinity National
Forest, along Route 96,

03:40.360 --> 03:42.999
also known as, "The Bigfoot Byway."

03:43.000 --> 03:44.919
I'm here at Bluff Creek,

03:44.920 --> 03:47.759
where I plan on re-tracing the famed

03:47.760 --> 03:53.702
1996 Patterson-Gimlin footage
in my search for Bigfoot.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.199
OK.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.599
- Are you a little nervous?
- Yeah.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.159
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.839
I can see it. I can see it.
You know what?

04:00.840 --> 04:02.319
I just want you to take these off.

04:02.320 --> 04:02.839
OK.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.319
- I want you to loosen up.
- Yeah.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.919
- And, just be yourself.
- All right.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.999
You know. It's like, "Hey,
lets..." Just talk and...

04:09.000 --> 04:10.559
We're here in this
beautiful place. Use it.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.300
OK.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.105
OK.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.199
Hey, what's up? I'm Jim Kessel.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.119
I'm here at the Trinity National
Forest, along Route 96,

04:21.120 --> 04:24.559
also known as, "The Bigfoot Byway."

04:24.560 --> 04:26.159
I'm here at Bluff Creek,

04:26.160 --> 04:27.799
where I plan on re-tracing the famed

04:27.800 --> 04:33.269
1967 Patterson-Gimlin footage
in my search for Bigfoot.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.229
Won't you join me?

04:38.640 --> 04:40.639
- Boom.
- Oh, nice.

04:40.640 --> 04:41.599
- Yeah?
- That was good.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.559
- That felt good.
- Yeah.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.999
- I'll buy that.
- It was good.

04:44.000 --> 04:44.559
- Nice.
- Good, babe.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.159
- Thank you, babe.
- Yeah.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.719
Did you see the
buckshot on this sign?

04:47.720 --> 04:49.359
What's that?

04:49.360 --> 04:51.599
Right here.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.399
And a bullet hole.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.948
Great. That makes me feel good.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.987
You'll be fine.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.199
You don't want to look stupid.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.559
Honey, I'm afraid
of a lot of things,

05:18.560 --> 05:20.999
but I'm not afraid to admit that
I don't believe in Bigfoot.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.199
I know, but just...

05:23.200 --> 05:26.271
How can you, how can you
prove there isn't one?

05:27.520 --> 05:30.719
Babe, I, I said that I,
I will come on this trip to,

05:30.720 --> 05:33.639
to help you with your film
and it's your birthday

05:33.640 --> 05:34.879
and we're going to
have a great time,

05:34.880 --> 05:37.199
but I'm not about to say
that I believe in Bigfoot.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.519
You don't have to say
you believe in Bigfoot.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.199
I'm just looking for, I don't know,

05:42.200 --> 05:44.479
"Maybe there is one, Jim.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.599
I'm not really sure,
but maybe you're right,

05:46.600 --> 05:47.559
maybe there is something out there."

05:47.560 --> 05:51.639
OK. You want to know why I, I,
I firmly believe there isn't?

05:51.640 --> 05:53.639
Why is there, has there never been

05:53.640 --> 05:56.439
a Bigfoot body that's
been discovered?

05:56.440 --> 06:00.079
All this time and no one
has ever found one?

06:00.080 --> 06:01.719
That's a little odd to me.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.039
Who knows?

06:03.040 --> 06:06.159
When's the last time you found
anything dead in the forest?

06:06.160 --> 06:08.039
Do you know how many millions
of acres there are of...

06:08.040 --> 06:09.279
Plenty of times.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.839
...unexplored forest out...
plenty of times. OK.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.039
You're seeing bones in the forest?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.919
Yes.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.879
Listen, who knows?
Maybe they bury their bodies.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.599
I don't know.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.079
There's forest is so
thick out here, babe.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.079
You can't see three
feet in front of you.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.039
I mean, there could be a
hundred Bigfoot corpses

06:26.040 --> 06:27.439
- within half a mile in here.
- Yeah.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.399
Nobody would ever even know it.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.279
There could be a hundred dead
leprechauns out there, too.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.279
Ha, ha, yeah.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.919
But no one, no one has
found those either.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.319
- Yeah, OK.
- Uh-huh.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.199
Uh, we're talking two
different things here.

06:37.200 --> 06:42.479
Aren't you curious to know
why for thousands of years,

06:42.480 --> 06:43.599
all right,

06:43.600 --> 06:47.639
people all over the world
have reported seeing

06:47.640 --> 06:51.826
an ape-like creature
walking through the woods?

06:52.440 --> 06:53.119
Not really.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.719
Well, then, why are you here?

06:54.720 --> 06:59.111
Because I like being with you.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.110
What?

07:04.480 --> 07:06.519
Oh, boy. Now, you're mad.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.261
No, I'm not mad.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.399
Honey, we can believe different
things and still be a couple.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.439
It's OK.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.959
I just don't want you
to think I'm crazy.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.559
Oh, I know you're crazy.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.639
I wouldn't be with you
if I didn't know that.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.108
I just don't believe in Bigfoot.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.439
- Hi.
- Action.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.519
Babe?

07:35.520 --> 07:36.919
I'm sorry.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.627
I'm so used to saying it. OK.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.639
Hi. I'm in Willow Creek,

07:45.640 --> 07:48.711
Mecca to the Bigfoot Community.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.711
Oh, yeah.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.439
That's it?

07:55.440 --> 07:56.519
Yeah, that's it.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.464
All right.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.279
Oh, check it out.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.519
Home of the Bigfoot Burger.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.439
And ammunition.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.439
Can't say I've ever dined
in a place with both.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.799
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.199
Well, you know, they
hold a gun to your face

08:11.200 --> 08:12.879
if you don't order
the Bigfoot Burger.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.620
Oh, God.

08:15.360 --> 08:18.759
I love the, uh, the,
uh, artwork here.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.679
- It looks like Bigfoot...
- Oh, yeah.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.679
...he really likes his
doughnuts and coffee.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.359
Is he toasting doughnuts?

08:24.360 --> 08:26.199
Could be bagels.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.399
Oh, and there's the other one.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.879
- Look, it's like us.
- Yeah.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.839
There I am bringing you flowers

08:32.840 --> 08:35.558
and there you are making
doughnuts and coffee.

08:35.559 --> 08:39.438
Making breakfast and there
you are prancing over,

08:39.440 --> 08:41.399
giving me my flowers for the day.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.390
That's awesome.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.279
That girl seems pretty
happy to be missing.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.145
Who is that?

08:49.240 --> 08:51.239
I should take a picture of you,

08:51.240 --> 08:53.879
of what you would look
like if you went missing.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.359
So that if you ever
go missing, I can...

08:56.360 --> 08:58.519
I can show what you would
actually look like.

08:58.520 --> 08:59.199
OK.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.719
We'll dirty you up.

09:01.720 --> 09:05.269
Give me your missing, give
me your missing photo face.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.639
- No, I don't think that's your...
- No?

09:08.640 --> 09:09.599
No.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.943
How about this? Um...

09:13.080 --> 09:14.239
That's pretty good.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.599
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.599
But I do feel like they all smile.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.799
Yeah.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.559
Maybe you would be happy if missing.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.279
Why would you be happy
to be missing, babe?

09:25.280 --> 09:27.464
I don't know.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.705
See that?

09:32.720 --> 09:34.159
So, lets see the Bigfoot Burger.

09:34.160 --> 09:34.959
Oh, check it out.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.919
Oh my God.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.919
Whoa. Yeah.
It even has the toe marks.

09:40.920 --> 09:41.919
Look at that.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.399
Do you think this is,
um, real Bigfoot meat?

09:45.400 --> 09:46.599
- No, honey.
- No?

09:46.600 --> 09:48.919
- This is just a Bigfoot Burger.
- Oh.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.479
It could be real Bigfoot meat.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.919
You know what would be really funny?

09:51.920 --> 09:55.503
- Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm.
- Is if, um, his...

09:58.360 --> 10:01.759
Yeah? Please, finish your thought.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.039
I was going to say that
it's a good thing,

10:04.040 --> 10:07.599
um, his feet are his most
prominent attribute.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.599
Or else, we could be eating
really big weeners right now.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.959
- That's a whole other restaurant, honey.
- Hmm-hmm.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.959
- I'll take you there...
- Mmm.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.119
...some other time.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.119
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.999
Mmm.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.439
- How is it?
- Wow, this...

10:20.440 --> 10:22.199
It's actually really good.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.509
- It's pretty sweet.
- Hmm-hmm.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.359
Mmm.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.959
Mmm.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.719
- Well, look at this, babe.
- Oh, yeah.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.719
What is that?

10:32.720 --> 10:34.119
What?

10:34.120 --> 10:35.639
Wow.

10:35.640 --> 10:36.879
It's a Bigfoot mural.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.999
Is that a van Gogh or
what do you think it is?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.119
Yeah.

10:40.120 --> 10:45.639
He's pushing a wheelbarrow
and hoeing a garden.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.137
And, very, he seems clinically..

10:48.163 --> 10:50.399
- depressed actually.
- Yeah.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.359
"Bigfoot sad.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.639
Bigfoot no want to work in garden."

10:55.640 --> 10:57.839
Why are they forcing him
to do all this work?

10:57.840 --> 10:59.199
I don't know. What the fuck is this?

10:59.200 --> 11:02.479
Like, they got him as a
day laborer or something.

11:02.480 --> 11:07.359
"Bigfoot help you put
up house for berries."

11:07.360 --> 11:10.999
I would avoid man, too,
if I had to do all of this shit.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.679
Yeah, no shit.

11:12.680 --> 11:13.879
Maybe he just doesn't want to work,

11:13.880 --> 11:15.759
- that's why they can't find him.
- Yeah.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.359
"Bigfoot tired of working."

11:18.360 --> 11:20.039
All right. Let's get out of here.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.519
This is so great.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.999
Is this... so, this is the town?

11:24.000 --> 11:24.999
This is it.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.279
- Oh, there. Bigfoot.
- Yeah.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.359
He's all over the place.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.239
Oh, there he is.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.469
- Hey, buddy.
- Chubby guy.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.199
Oh, I got to get this.
Bigfoot Avenue.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.519
This must be where he lives.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.226
Yeah.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.039
Is that where we're staying?

11:42.040 --> 11:44.359
Oh, yeah. Bigfoot Motel.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.279
Oh, great.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.599
Yeah.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.039
This place is heaven, babe.

11:50.040 --> 11:54.559
This is the great O'Mah
statue carved by Jim McClarin

11:54.560 --> 11:58.319
out of one giant piece of redwood
right around the same time

11:58.320 --> 12:01.107
Patterson shot his famed footage.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.639
I like his bangs.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.879
- You do?
- Hmm-hmm.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.439
They have the whole
flippy thing going on?

12:07.440 --> 12:08.239
Well, he didn't.

12:08.240 --> 12:12.261
He wished he could have re-carved him
after he heard Albert Ostman's account.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.119
You're really making me horny.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.039
Go up there and stand next to it.

12:17.040 --> 12:17.959
Why?

12:17.960 --> 12:20.439
For a scale. Go on.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.359
How come people don't know
how big I am? I could be huge.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.305
Check that out.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.110
Get closer.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.624
He's a nice-looking guy,

12:31.200 --> 12:32.667
kind of cute.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.559
Don't do that, baby.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.199
Baby, just don't do that. Seriously.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.039
May I help you?

12:39.040 --> 12:41.269
- He's lonely.
- May I help you?

12:41.560 --> 12:43.439
Yeah. Do you mind
if we interview you?

12:43.440 --> 12:44.639
I told you I was new at this.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.426
OK. Here we go.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.268
Hi. Are we going?

12:55.960 --> 12:58.319
Hi, I'm here with Nita Rowley,

12:58.320 --> 13:00.239
who's worked at the Willow
Creek Visitor Center

13:00.240 --> 13:01.439
for the last 20 years.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.239
How are you, Nita?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.799
I'm doing well. Thank you.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.799
Well, good.
I have a question for you.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.759
Do you know of anyone or
do you know personally

13:08.760 --> 13:11.399
the exact site of the
Patterson-Gimlin?

13:11.400 --> 13:13.959
Uh, no, I do not.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.799
And, um, has there been any
recent sightings of Bigfoot

13:17.800 --> 13:19.759
or Sasquatch in the area?

13:19.760 --> 13:21.919
No, not to my knowledge.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.599
Are you a believer?

13:23.600 --> 13:25.319
Not at all.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.439
No, huh?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.199
OK.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.599
Is it safe to camp here?

13:31.600 --> 13:34.039
Uh, you have to be on the lookout,

13:34.040 --> 13:38.759
uh, for bear, mountain
lions, rattle snakes,

13:38.760 --> 13:43.639
um, but it's, it's safe,
I mean, you take your chances.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.439
Have you ever heard of
anyone being attacked

13:45.440 --> 13:47.279
by a mountain lion
or a bear out here?

13:47.280 --> 13:48.879
Uh, yes.

13:48.880 --> 13:51.039
I haven't heard the,
uh, bear attacks.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.799
Uh, basically, they
get into the garbage,

13:53.800 --> 13:56.039
uh, and come in to steal your food.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.350
The mountain lions, uh, will attack.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.747
What would you do if you
saw Big Foot, Nita?

14:03.840 --> 14:05.799
I don't expect to see one.

14:05.800 --> 14:10.399
Um, I, I really wouldn't
be surprised, um,

14:10.400 --> 14:12.719
because I just don't believe in it.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.631
We're rolling.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.199
I got really lucky.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.239
Um, we're here at Bigfoot
Books with the owner,

14:26.240 --> 14:28.079
Steve Streufert.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.719
What's up, Steve?

14:29.720 --> 14:30.719
The usual thing,

14:30.720 --> 14:33.039
Bigfoot every day out
here in Willow Creek.

14:33.040 --> 14:33.719
Yeah, nice.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.319
I heard you had a little, uh,
you were just out there.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.839
Yeah, we were out of Bluff Creek.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.039
Yeah, Bluff Creek.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.159
Uh, it is about 29
miles north of here,

14:41.160 --> 14:43.079
you come to the bottom
of Bluff Creek there.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.079
Hmm-hmm.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.559
And that was where the
Patterson film was shot.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.439
Yes, of course.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.359
Also, these, uh,
footprints that you,

14:50.360 --> 14:51.999
uh, may have seen before...

14:52.000 --> 14:53.359
Yeah.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.039
These were cast out in
Bluff Creek in 1958.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.919
Sure.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.839
Wow. So, these are
the Jerry Crew cast?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.359
That is from the
same track way of...

15:01.360 --> 15:02.119
Yeah.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.439
...the famous Jerry Crew
track was taken from.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.279
That's incredible.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.359
And that's where,
obviously, you know,

15:08.360 --> 15:10.399
they coined the name Bigfoot...

15:10.400 --> 15:11.239
Yeah.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.399
The contractors on the road
building project out there

15:14.400 --> 15:15.879
and the loggers, um,

15:15.880 --> 15:18.599
had very strange activity
going on out there.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.399
Yeah.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.799
They were cutting a new
road into this virgin timber,

15:21.800 --> 15:24.879
so, um, they started
finding these footprints

15:24.880 --> 15:29.559
out on the dusty plowed road
and they called it, "Bigfoot."

15:29.560 --> 15:32.599
Apparently, there were
some that saw it out there,

15:32.600 --> 15:35.599
so, uh, you know,
the big feet were connected

15:35.600 --> 15:37.719
- with a creature that was...
- I didn't realize that.

15:37.720 --> 15:42.079
...that was also throwing a
big 55 gallon fuel drums and,

15:42.080 --> 15:46.439
uh, spools of metal logging
wire down into the creek,

15:46.440 --> 15:49.959
uh, vandalizing their
camp, in general.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.959
So, that's where that
name came from in 1958.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.399
Right.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.839
This is the model that was
used by Roger Patterson.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.599
He rented this and
came out here and,

15:59.600 --> 16:00.999
- you know, it's very heavy.
- Yeah.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.999
He, he, this is what he used
to film while running across a,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.559
- a regular gravel bar and rocks in the...
- Yeah.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.039
...in the creek.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.239
They were also used for, uh,
making home movies and,

16:12.240 --> 16:14.239
uh, amateur films like pornos.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.039
Oh, that's awesome.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.239
Wow, that's so heavy.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.759
Tell me a little bit about, um,
the Patterson-Gimlin site

16:19.760 --> 16:21.919
and just how to get there, man.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.599
Oh, well, um, you
can take this road,

16:24.600 --> 16:27.079
I can show on the map,
and you go down that road.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.279
- It's probably easier that way.
- That would be great.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.439
You come down to the bottom and
there's an old camp site there,

16:33.440 --> 16:36.439
you know, and, uh, when
you're at that camp site,

16:36.440 --> 16:38.159
you basically just take a right.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.119
You have to bushwhack and
go through the forest.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.599
- My girlfriend is OK with that.
- But it's not... you won't get lost.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.639
Just follow the sound of
the creek on your left

16:45.640 --> 16:47.479
and look at the hill on your right.

16:47.480 --> 16:51.119
You just keep going straight between
those until you come to a big gulch

16:51.120 --> 16:53.359
and you'll see it all
blasted out with rocks

16:53.360 --> 16:55.479
and log debris and, uh,

16:55.480 --> 16:58.919
- that's the bottom of the film site area.
- Wow.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.479
So, you go, you're going to
have to go down in the creek.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.519
Be careful not to twist
your ankle, you know.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.279
Just getting to the site,

17:05.280 --> 17:07.799
is it kind of dangerous
or would you...?

17:07.800 --> 17:09.479
Uh, well, there is
the thing we called,

17:09.480 --> 17:11.159
"The Curse of Bluff Creek."

17:11.160 --> 17:11.999
What's that?

17:12.000 --> 17:15.839
Uh, wait, that's sort of related
to The Curse of Bigfoot, but...

17:15.839 --> 17:17.799
The Curse of Bigfoot
usually means that,

17:17.800 --> 17:19.799
you know, like you're
going to get divorced,

17:19.800 --> 17:22.319
your friends will all
think you're crazy,

17:22.319 --> 17:24.999
uh, you'll be, uh, impecunious

17:25.000 --> 17:26.638
and you'll spend all of your days

17:26.640 --> 17:29.559
searching for something
that you never find.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.479
Um, that's kind of a classic thing

17:31.480 --> 17:33.839
with the old researchers, you know.

17:33.840 --> 17:34.959
Hmm-hmm.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.359
But, um, that's sort of a joke.

17:36.360 --> 17:39.399
The, the, um, the real truth
of it is that you're out

17:39.400 --> 17:40.999
in the middle of nowhere, you know,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.039
so you, you don't
really want to, uh,

17:44.040 --> 17:46.319
just go out there
unprepared, you know.

17:46.320 --> 17:46.999
Right.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.039
There's no food and there's no water

17:49.040 --> 17:52.679
unless you want to drink the wild water
and hunt the wild animals, you know.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.239
There are some berries and things,

17:54.240 --> 17:55.879
which you have to
know the wild plants,

17:55.880 --> 17:58.039
so I'd say, you know, go prepared

17:58.040 --> 18:01.719
and have the tools you
need to survive, right?

18:01.720 --> 18:03.559
- Yeah.
- A lot of people aren't ready for that.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.599
They think there should
be a, a campground there

18:05.600 --> 18:07.719
with a like porter
potty or something.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.199
You know, you're not in the...

18:09.200 --> 18:11.519
It's still the wilderness.
I mean, it's...

18:11.520 --> 18:13.399
Yeah. It's not technically
a wilderness,

18:13.400 --> 18:15.399
but it's still pretty
wild, you know,

18:15.400 --> 18:19.279
and we've seen many, many
bears, uh, out there,

18:19.280 --> 18:22.039
um, so, watch out for that.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.399
We are going to go see Tom Yamarone.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.679
He's the Bob Dylan of
the Bigfoot Community.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.839
Where does he live, Mordor?

18:28.840 --> 18:32.464
- No jokes around him, all right?
- So, can I look him in the eye?

18:32.720 --> 18:34.824
OK. No jokes.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.359
- All right, great.
- We're rolling.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.239
This is like Christmas in July,

18:38.240 --> 18:40.759
uh, because I'm here
with Tom Yamarone and,

18:40.760 --> 18:43.719
uh, Tom, I know you know Bob Gimlin.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.439
I do.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.199
So, uh, why don't you tell
us a little bit about, um,

18:47.200 --> 18:48.799
the Patterson-Gimlin site?

18:48.800 --> 18:50.799
Yeah. Well, I'll tell you,
it's a site that's so remote

18:50.800 --> 18:52.759
and what you're going
to love about it

18:52.760 --> 18:55.199
is, when you get in there,
it's a steep canyon,

18:55.200 --> 18:58.559
there's a running creek,
there's forest that's thick

18:58.560 --> 19:00.719
and you're going to feel
how isolated they were.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.919
They were really truly
in the wilderness.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.399
How do you think those guys
were feeling that day when...

19:05.400 --> 19:06.759
I mean, they've been,
they've been searching

19:06.760 --> 19:08.879
for a little while and to finally,

19:08.880 --> 19:10.879
to finally come across what was,

19:10.880 --> 19:12.599
you know, there by the riverbed...?

19:12.600 --> 19:14.919
Yeah. Well, you know,
I'll tell you, they were bored,

19:14.920 --> 19:17.799
not bored, but they had, they
had no success up to that point

19:17.800 --> 19:19.959
and, boom, they come
around that log jam

19:19.960 --> 19:24.319
and there's this big hair-covered
creature standing there,

19:24.320 --> 19:25.639
starts walking away from them

19:25.640 --> 19:28.919
and they knew right then they
had won the prize, you know,

19:28.920 --> 19:30.279
if they could get it on film

19:30.280 --> 19:33.479
and so, Patterson scrambles,
Gimlin watches him,

19:33.480 --> 19:35.919
and they, they think they got it.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.639
So, they were, couldn't
have been more excited.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.959
You know, the only thing that would be
better, if there was a song about it.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.439
I just so happened
to have written one.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.799

21:35.720 --> 21:37.439
OK.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.719
Hi, I'm here with, uh,
Shaun White Guy Sr.

21:40.720 --> 21:44.039
She's, uh, a resident of
the Hopa reservation.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.559
And, Shaun, I understand
you have a Sasquatch story

21:46.560 --> 21:48.079
that you'd be willing
to share with us?

21:48.080 --> 21:50.559
Um, yeah, I just have a small story.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.559
It's, uh, me and my dad,
uh, went on a camping or,

21:54.560 --> 21:57.239
you know, a, a Christian... cut.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.359
- It's Hoopa.
- Hoopa?

21:59.360 --> 22:00.239
Yes, Hoopa.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.599
Okay, good. Thank you.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.959
Hi. I'm here with
Shaun White Guy Sr.,

22:03.960 --> 22:09.039
and, uh, she is a resident of
the, uh, Hoopa Reservation,

22:09.040 --> 22:12.279
and I understand you'd be willing
to share a Sasquatch story with us?

22:12.280 --> 22:13.399
Um, yeah.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.039
Um, when I was little,
about eight years old,

22:16.040 --> 22:18.599
I, uh, wanted to go on a camping,

22:18.600 --> 22:21.599
a Christian like, camping
trip with my dad...

22:21.600 --> 22:22.119
Hmm-hmm.

22:22.120 --> 22:26.119
And so, I asked to go and
he said I could go and, um,

22:26.120 --> 22:29.599
we were heading towards like,
Ferndale, Garberville area.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.759
I wasn't too sure,
but I know I was going.

22:32.760 --> 22:36.559
And so, um, we're
following my Uncle Tiny,

22:36.560 --> 22:39.439
and then, all of a sudden, um,

22:39.440 --> 22:42.079
a big black image came
in-between the cars

22:42.080 --> 22:43.959
and my dad turned the steering wheel

22:43.960 --> 22:48.799
and we flipped into the like,
the gutter, and we looked up

22:48.800 --> 22:52.679
and there was Sasquatch
walking in front of us,

22:52.680 --> 22:55.319
up towards the, the like, field,

22:55.320 --> 22:58.319
a big huge, it was a
big square open field

22:58.320 --> 22:59.839
and there was the tree range

22:59.840 --> 23:03.799
and we actually got to watch
him, uh, walk in front of us

23:03.800 --> 23:07.959
and he was tall and he
was like, long-haired...

23:07.960 --> 23:10.519
- Were you scared?
- Uh, yeah, I was, I was scared.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.199
I couldn't believe
that it, you know,

23:12.200 --> 23:14.359
I always heard rumors and
everybody's talking about,

23:14.360 --> 23:16.639
that they've seen it, you know, and,

23:16.640 --> 23:19.039
and when I actually
looked up and saw him,

23:19.040 --> 23:21.639
he was just big and he was hairy

23:21.640 --> 23:25.679
and he made like this weird,
like snorkeling kind of sound.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.639
I, I, I'd never heard it before.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.439
And then, when he turned
around and looked,

23:30.440 --> 23:32.439
all I could see is his little
brown eyes with like,

23:32.440 --> 23:36.239
right here is like,
skin around his eyes.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.159
There was no hair right
there, just skin,

23:38.160 --> 23:40.559
and he just looked back
and made this little noise

23:40.560 --> 23:42.279
and then, I just looked away

23:42.280 --> 23:44.319
and I just closed my
eyes and I was like,

23:44.320 --> 23:47.221
"Oh, don't come back, don't."

23:47.360 --> 23:49.159
I just don't believe in Bigfoot.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.599
Do you know how many new species
are discovered every single year?

23:52.600 --> 23:54.919
Twenty thousand species
every single year.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.159
Right.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.279
OK.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.519
And, what do you
think that's including?

23:58.520 --> 24:01.039
Do you think that's including
animals and creatures?

24:01.040 --> 24:04.879
That's plants, plankton,
uh, microscopic organisms.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.639
- Oh, yeah.
- Not what we're talking about.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.359
And, and I'm talking
about mammals, too.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.599
Monkeys. All right?

24:09.600 --> 24:12.479
Do you know last year, they
discovered a snub-nosed monkey?

24:12.480 --> 24:14.839
That's a brand new species
they never even knew existed,

24:14.840 --> 24:16.639
- but they found it.
- Yeah, but...

24:16.640 --> 24:18.719
And they never even found
a body, dead or alive,

24:18.720 --> 24:20.319
but they found it.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.039
Not finding a tiny monkey
in a giant rainforest

24:23.040 --> 24:24.159
the size of a continent

24:24.160 --> 24:28.559
is not the same as not finding
a 900-pound hairy biped

24:28.560 --> 24:30.559
roaming around a very
highly populated

24:30.560 --> 24:31.959
Pacific Northwest area.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.269
That's not the same, babe.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.559
So, you're a ranger?

24:36.560 --> 24:38.559
Seventeen years.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.839
Is that cool if we, if
we mentioned that or...?

24:40.840 --> 24:43.479
Oh, I don't think it's important.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.479
- I, I wouldn't.
- That's cool.

24:45.480 --> 24:49.639
Uh, so, um, I'm here
with Troy Andrews and,

24:49.640 --> 24:51.759
uh, you know, he's
willing to share with us,

24:51.760 --> 24:55.199
uh, uh, an incredible,
uh, encounter.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.319
When did this happen?

24:57.320 --> 25:00.679
Oh, a couple of years ago.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.359
I was hunting in New Orleans.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.759
That's, uh, where Bluff Creek is?

25:04.760 --> 25:07.439
Yeah. Well, near there.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.679
Sorry. Just go on. Yeah.

25:09.680 --> 25:12.839
Yeah. So, I was out in,
out in the woods with my,

25:12.840 --> 25:15.759
my dog, Bella, a beautiful girl.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.759
She was a golden retriever,

25:18.760 --> 25:23.119
and, uh, well, she, she
took off in the woods and,

25:23.120 --> 25:26.519
uh, and I called, called
for her to stop and,

25:26.520 --> 25:27.839
uh, she didn't, you know.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.959
She just kept going and,
uh, which is weird,

25:29.960 --> 25:33.359
because usually,
she's very obedient.

25:33.360 --> 25:36.119
And, uh, so I went in
the woods after her.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.799
I was, I was calling
and calling and, uh,

25:38.800 --> 25:39.959
nothing, you know.

25:39.960 --> 25:44.239
She, uh, I kept calling and, and,

25:44.240 --> 25:46.799
and then, I started to get
a little nervous because

25:46.800 --> 25:50.639
the sun was going down,
it was starting to get dark,

25:50.640 --> 25:56.319
and, uh, I kept calling and
all of a sudden, I heard this,

25:56.320 --> 25:59.079
this, this, this, she was
growling and whimpering

25:59.080 --> 26:03.479
and, uh, and then,
she cut loose with this,

26:03.480 --> 26:07.799
with this horrible
growl, wail kind of.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.268
It was, it was like a scream.

26:13.320 --> 26:17.999
When I got there, it was too late.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.628
She was dead.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.948
I loved that dog.

26:26.160 --> 26:29.186
You know, it hurt bad.

26:30.160 --> 26:35.759
Uh, someone or,
or something had, uh,

26:35.760 --> 26:42.279
just ripped poor Bella in half,

26:42.280 --> 26:44.305
apart.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.199
Bigfoot?

26:46.200 --> 26:49.519
Well, I don't...
I wouldn't say that.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.359
I mean, there's...

26:51.360 --> 26:54.119
There's a lot of people
who live back in the,

26:54.120 --> 26:55.999
in these woods and, uh,

26:56.000 --> 26:59.199
they just don't like other
people into their business here.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.199
Like who?

27:01.200 --> 27:06.279
Oh, like, uh, uh, pot farmers and,

27:06.280 --> 27:10.159
river people, locals, uh,

27:10.160 --> 27:13.359
I don't know, uh, pets and people

27:13.360 --> 27:15.359
go missing all the time here.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.119
Right. But you had
mentioned to me earlier,

27:17.120 --> 27:20.519
um, when you were telling me this
story that you had the feeling that,

27:20.520 --> 27:24.399
that it might have been
something, a Bigfoot.

27:24.400 --> 27:28.799
Well, whoever or whatever it was,

27:28.800 --> 27:31.871
I don't know, you know.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.981
I just miss my dog.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.359
Thanks, Troy.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.544
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it, man.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.119
That was a terrible story.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.199
I know.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.559
So, what do you
think killed his dog?

27:51.560 --> 27:53.839
I don't know. It could
have been anything.

27:53.840 --> 27:57.039
Yeah. He was lying.
He knows what killed his dog.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.199
Are you serious?
You don't believe that guy,

27:59.200 --> 28:01.239
but you believe any
nut job out there

28:01.240 --> 28:04.159
that says Sasquatch is real?

28:04.160 --> 28:05.639
I don't know.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.399
I think we have to
re-think this whole

28:07.400 --> 28:09.359
going into the woods thing.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.559
Oh, I'm not re-thinking anything.

28:11.560 --> 28:12.719
I'll go in there myself.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.519
You can just stay here
in town, if you want.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.719
Can we at least have a normal
discussion about this?

28:17.720 --> 28:20.519
Does it just... right away,
it's got to be either/or?

28:20.520 --> 28:23.079
Listen. I'm not going to
let one guy ruin our trip,

28:23.080 --> 28:24.079
all right?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.799
Biggie, today is the day
we hike into Bluff Creek

29:47.800 --> 29:48.999
to come look for you.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.389
How, how do you feel about that?

29:51.640 --> 29:54.063
- Uh-huh?
- It's not a joke.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.519
OK.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.359
- You shouldn't go there.
- Thank you.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.639
Have a nice day.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.869
Sorry.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.919
- Let's do it again.
- OK.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.839
So, I'm here with Bigfoot and, uh,

30:07.840 --> 30:09.919
Biggie, today is the day we're
going to come look for you.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.679
Are you cool with that?

30:11.680 --> 30:13.839
"Oh, yeah, me very cool."

30:13.840 --> 30:15.839
Good. Let's go get him.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.039
All right.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.519
This is so beautiful here.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.639
I know.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.039
We could move up here
tomorrow and be fine with it.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.839
Hmm, I don't know about that.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.439
I don't think I could
ever live here.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.999
Really? Why not?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.119
- What would I do?
- I don't know.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.479
Be a farm hand?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.679
Yeah.

30:31.680 --> 30:32.479
I don't know.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.639
I'm sure there's some pretty good
regional theater up here you could do.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.959
Yeah. I think I've done all
the regional theater I care,

30:38.960 --> 30:41.399
uh, to do, honey.

30:41.400 --> 30:44.039
The Entire Works of Shakespeare
by Kelley Monteleone.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.039
Yeah.

30:45.040 --> 30:48.350
The Trinity National
Forest Art Center.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.999
No, I love that I've done all that,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.079
but, you know, I'd like
to do some more stuff.

30:54.080 --> 31:00.223
I'd like to do TV and film
and that's mostly in LA.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.719
I'm probably going to have
to eventually be there.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.399
- What? LA?
- Yeah.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.159
Are you serious?

31:09.160 --> 31:10.879
Yeah.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.587
Oh, OK.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.479
Because I could never move to LA.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.399
Fuck that.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.239
You know, if I moved to LA,

31:20.240 --> 31:22.199
I would still be the same
person and so would you.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.279
I know you would be.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.999
I'm not saying, you, I'm
talking about everybody else

31:25.000 --> 31:27.199
you have to live with down there.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.589
A bunch of freeholes.

31:30.400 --> 31:35.189
The last time I was there, babe, they
put fruit in their, fruit in my sushi.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.799
Who does that?

31:37.800 --> 31:39.479
Is that... what did they
call that? Frushi?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.519
They called it...

31:40.520 --> 31:43.999
Yeah, that's what... that's what
I'm going to call it, frushi.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.439
I like that.

31:45.440 --> 31:50.079
That says everything you need
to know about LA, to a T.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.186
Again, with the leprechauns?
I'm recording.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.919
Trinity National Forest.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.999
Over 2 million acres of
unexplored wilderness.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.999
There could be a whole
herd of Bigfoot out here.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.599
Or, leprechauns.

32:05.600 --> 32:08.959
All right. First of all,
leprechauns aren't real, okay?

32:08.960 --> 32:10.427
Bigfoot...

32:11.000 --> 32:15.471
<i>♪ Roger and Bob,
they rode out that day</i>

32:17.400 --> 32:19.119
I'm sorry. I love that song.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.519
No, you have a really
good voice for that.

32:21.520 --> 32:22.719
Thank you.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.665
Nice...

32:30.320 --> 32:34.039
And I have no cell reception.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.827
The beginning of every horror movie.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.999
Are you getting excited?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.919
Yeah.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.239
I think we're getting close.

32:46.240 --> 32:49.239
I hope so because it's
been a very long drive

32:49.240 --> 32:50.999
up a very narrow road.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.719
I realize I just turned
on my turn signal.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.279
I don't think you need to
worry about that here.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.879
I don't think I need it either.

32:56.880 --> 32:57.949
No.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.947
Let's see. Oh.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.479
- Someone's up there.
- Who's this guy?

33:03.480 --> 33:05.789
Oh, better stop.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.159
Hey, how is it going, man?

33:11.160 --> 33:13.159
Hey, is this the final
pass to get to the,

33:13.160 --> 33:15.439
uh, PGF film site?

33:15.440 --> 33:17.079
No, I'm sorry.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.159
It, it got washed out
a long time ago.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.799
There's nothing down there anymore.

33:20.800 --> 33:21.759
Oh, yeah.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.519
No, I've heard about that, man, but,

33:23.520 --> 33:25.199
uh, I think we're going
to check it out anyway.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.639
I think what you want to do is,
you want to turn this around

33:27.640 --> 33:29.239
and go back the way you came

33:29.240 --> 33:32.949
and just keep driving until
you get back to town.

33:33.280 --> 33:36.319
Uh, actually, man,
I was told to come this way.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.599
We've been traveling all day, so...

33:37.600 --> 33:38.839
Could you turn that
camera off, please?

33:38.840 --> 33:40.751
Oh, sorry.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.599
So, I think we're just going to
move on now, man. Thank you.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.319
I've already tried being nice.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.599
Now, I'm telling you,
turn this thing around,

33:47.600 --> 33:50.639
drive back the way you came,
keep going until you hit town,

33:50.640 --> 33:51.919
maybe you can get there

33:51.920 --> 33:53.639
and get yourselves
a couple of t-shirts

33:53.640 --> 33:57.508
and maybe have a nice slice
of pie at the Fuck Off Cafe?

33:59.280 --> 34:01.119
- OK. So...
- All right?

34:01.120 --> 34:01.959
OK. We got it.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.319
Why don't you get the
fuck out of here?

34:03.320 --> 34:05.799
- Turn that fucking thing off.
- OK. I'm sorry.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.959
Let's go, Jim. Come on.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.063
- Have a nice day.
- OK...

34:12.080 --> 34:14.399
I'll just run this
motherfucker over right now.

34:14.400 --> 34:14.958
- Uh...
- Go on.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.621
Honey, let's just get
out of here. Come on.

34:18.040 --> 34:22.750
This guy is obviously not
excited with us being here.

34:24.320 --> 34:25.998
Did he just fucking throw a rock?

34:26.000 --> 34:27.399
What?

34:27.400 --> 34:29.239
He did?

34:29.239 --> 34:30.639
So, what are we going to do now?

34:30.639 --> 34:33.319
Well, I didn't come all this
way to get turned around

34:33.320 --> 34:35.708
by that asshole.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.627
Lucky for me, I know another way in.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.746
I don't know if that's
a good idea, Jim.

34:43.159 --> 34:45.822
Just hang in there, all right?

34:47.679 --> 34:49.359
Yeah?

34:49.360 --> 34:50.159
Can you do that?

34:50.159 --> 34:52.399
Yeah, I guess so.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.998
All right.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.389
Would you like me to narrate?

34:58.080 --> 35:00.025
Yeah.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.439
Oh. Hey, what's up?

35:03.440 --> 35:09.119
Uh, this is Kelly, just, uh,
driving with my boyfriend.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.279
Um,

35:11.280 --> 35:14.719
I'm not sure where we
are right now, but...

35:14.720 --> 35:19.839
We are in the Trinity
National Forest.

35:19.840 --> 35:20.999
Ooh.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.519
Balls deep in the Trinity
National Forest?

35:23.520 --> 35:25.559
Hellz, yeah.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.199
So, babe, we did it.

35:27.200 --> 35:31.039
This is, this is the actual road...

35:31.040 --> 35:32.559
To what?

35:32.560 --> 35:34.479
What do you think to what?

35:34.480 --> 35:37.039
To the Patterson-Gimlin film site.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.639
This is it. This is bonafide,

35:39.640 --> 35:42.586
so fuck you, hillbilly.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.199
I told you I know a way in.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.639
You sure did, babe,
but we're really...

35:48.640 --> 35:50.359
What do you think about that?

35:50.360 --> 35:55.479
I think it's, um, scary, this road.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.159
Oh.

35:56.160 --> 35:59.231
I mean, we're driving
in the day time.

35:59.800 --> 36:00.959
Yeah.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.239
Hmm.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.679
What did they,
what did they ride in on,

36:04.680 --> 36:05.799
horses or something or...?

36:05.800 --> 36:09.668
Yeah, but this is how you
get to the PGF site now.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.399
Hang on.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.199
Oh, oh.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.479
Bumpity, bumpity.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.599
Last stop for the car.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.159
Ah.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.662
We got to hike the
rest of the way in.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.390
But babe, this is it.

36:24.520 --> 36:25.839
We're going to get there.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.879
Yes, we are. Can we get
out of the car now?

36:27.880 --> 36:30.144
I would love that. Let's do it.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.828
We're here.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.199
We're here.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.599
We're leaving the car behind

36:38.600 --> 36:40.679
- and this is it, babe.
- This is it.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.999
This is the road that
leads to Bluff Creek.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.599
Ooh.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.519
To the famed
Patterson-Gimlin film site.

36:47.520 --> 36:49.510
Whoa.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.584
What do you think?

36:54.120 --> 36:55.959
- I didn't...
- Holy shit.

36:55.960 --> 36:58.799
I don't think I
pictured it like this.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.399
This is awesome.

37:01.400 --> 37:05.239
Babe, this is the dream I've
had since I was eight years old.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.879
- I know.
- Thank you.

37:06.880 --> 37:09.559
I'm happy to be here,
honey. Come on.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.479
Let's go.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.239
Yup.

37:12.240 --> 37:16.187
Ooo, is there a
Starbucks on the way?

37:18.280 --> 37:20.439
How long did you say it takes?

37:20.440 --> 37:23.466
Mmm, air is clean.

37:23.840 --> 37:27.389
- And, another brilliant observation, honey.
- Shut up.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.759
Check out that moss.

37:30.760 --> 37:31.679
Whoa.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.909
Ah, sweet.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.239
Poop!

37:53.240 --> 37:54.279
Whoa.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.119
Oh, look at all that.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.439
That could be Bigfoot scat.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.999
Yeah, or it could be bear shit.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.959
Or, Pope shit.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.825
OK.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.039
Ahh.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.239
It's prickly.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.039
Ouch!

38:16.040 --> 38:17.679
Here, babe.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.599
Grab the camera.

38:19.600 --> 38:24.667
- Get some of me walking through.
- Sure. Why not? I'd love to.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.999
I like nature.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.399
- Oh.
- Aw!

38:30.400 --> 38:31.599
Yeah. Are you all right?

38:31.600 --> 38:34.039
- Yes.
- Yeah?

38:34.040 --> 38:37.108
- All right. Just watch yourself.
- Oh, right in the nose.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.904
Oh, shit.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.911
Ooh.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.199
Are you getting this?

38:47.200 --> 38:49.039
Oh, yeah, I'm getting it.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.079
All right.

38:51.080 --> 38:54.026
"Are you getting this, huh?"

38:56.640 --> 38:57.679
Watch your step here.

38:57.680 --> 39:01.119
Yeah, I'm trying to, to film

39:01.120 --> 39:04.639
and walk at the same time
in a treacherous area.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.983
Bear with me.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.184
Not even a path.

39:13.960 --> 39:14.919
What the fuck?

39:14.920 --> 39:17.399
How do we know we're
going in the right direction?

39:17.400 --> 39:19.119
Just keep going, babe.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.719
We're almost there.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.587
This is fucking ridiculous.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.581
Ah.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.145
Ooh.

39:31.680 --> 39:36.479
So, by my estimations,
we're about an hour

39:36.480 --> 39:40.119
to an hour and a half
from the PGF film site.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.999
Turn off the camera.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.959
- What?
- Turn off the...

39:43.960 --> 39:46.622
So, we decided to set up camp here.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.669
Check this out.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.959
Jim?

39:58.960 --> 40:01.861
- Hold on, let me just get this.
- I need you to...

40:04.240 --> 40:08.799
It's amazing to think that
we're in the same woods

40:08.800 --> 40:14.119
that Roger Patterson and Bob
Gimlin were in 45 years ago

40:14.120 --> 40:17.749
when they saw that creature.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.679
What do you think?

40:22.680 --> 40:25.228
It's very pretty.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.759
Babe.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.910
Hey, babe, come here.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.279
What?

40:38.280 --> 40:40.748
Come here. I want to
show you something.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.599
Come here. I got a
little surprise for you.

40:52.600 --> 40:53.359
Really?

40:53.360 --> 40:55.669
Yeah, really.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.519
OK. Bring it over here.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.639
No, no, no. Come on.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.585
Follow me.

41:03.600 --> 41:06.341
Oh my God.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.471
Told you.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.799
Wow.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.189
This is insane.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.559
You did good.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.999
All right, I'm going in.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.679
- You are?
- Yeah.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.079
Oh my God. OK.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.559
So hot.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.461
Yeah. Whoa!

41:28.800 --> 41:30.679
Oh my God.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.466
Whoa!

41:33.680 --> 41:35.559
Oh! It's cold.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.879
Yeah?

41:36.880 --> 41:39.999
Baby, I am proud of you.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.389
How cold do you think that is?

41:45.080 --> 41:46.599
Should I get in there?

41:46.600 --> 41:48.590
No.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.279
Whoa.

41:50.280 --> 41:54.279
I like that you had no hesitation jumping
in that water even though I didn't get in.

41:54.280 --> 41:56.399
What is my sock doing in the tree?

41:56.400 --> 41:58.470
Oh, what sock?

42:01.160 --> 42:03.662
