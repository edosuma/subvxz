     ADULT ADAM:
     <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
     <i> the most terrifying place</i>

00:02.570 --> 00:06.739
 <i> in existence for any freshman</i>
 <i> was the high-school cafeteria.</i>

00:06.741 --> 00:09.308
    <i> The table you chose defined</i>
    <i> how you were labeled</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:11.477
      <i> and where you ranked</i>
      <i> in the social hierarchy.</i>

00:11.479 --> 00:14.079
           I don't see
           any seats together.
           What should we do?

00:14.081 --> 00:15.014
 Every man for himself.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.883
 If anyone asks,
 I'm a skate rat now.

00:20.388 --> 00:20.919
    Ooh.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.788
           ADULT ADAM:
           <i> Classic Dave Kim.</i>

00:22.790 --> 00:24.456
 Figuring out
 where to sit, eh?

00:24.458 --> 00:28.227
                    Yeah.
      Ah, that's a sad dance
      that I know all too well.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.229
      But lucky for you,
      I'm a guidance counselor,

00:30.231 --> 00:32.430
          and I can guide you
          to lunchroom success.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.366
          Um, maybe I could sit
          with the preppies?

00:34.368 --> 00:37.870
 Come on, man.
 You want to walk around
 in boat shoes with no socks?

00:37.872 --> 00:40.406
   You want to invite that kind
   of fungus in your life?

00:40.408 --> 00:42.207
         Okay. How about
         the band geeks?

00:42.209 --> 00:45.144
           Do you even play
           an instrument?
           No, you don't.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.713
 So what makes you think
 they're gonna just welcome you

00:47.715 --> 00:49.848
            into their unique
            and beautiful fold?

00:49.850 --> 00:52.217
                 Uh, maybe
                 the Goth kids?

00:52.219 --> 00:54.553
      The Goths?
      They would eat you alive.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.522
       Seriously, I heard
       they eat cats and stuff.

00:56.524 --> 00:59.291
         Come on!
         I gotta sit somewhere!
         Time's running out!

00:59.293 --> 01:01.527
    Agreed. And you're starting
    to look real desperate,

01:01.529 --> 01:03.495
        and standing next to me
        is not helping you.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.230
              Please, just go!
          Mmm, okay.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.099
    ADULT ADAM:
    <i> I was officially tableless.</i>

01:07.101 --> 01:08.467
       <i> If I didn't find</i>
       <i> a place to sit,</i>

01:08.469 --> 01:10.636
   <i> I'd be</i>
   <i> a social pariah forever.</i>

01:10.638 --> 01:12.438
              Hey, Goldberg,
              come sit with us.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.306
        <i> Just then the sportos</i>
        <i> beckon me</i>

01:14.308 --> 01:16.642
    <i> to sit at the coolest table</i>
    <i> in the cafeteria.</i>

01:16.644 --> 01:19.812
     <i> It was either a miracle</i>
     <i> or a huge mistake.</i>

01:19.814 --> 01:20.979
      Grab a chair, little man.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.681
  And the plate of waffle fries
  is for sharing.

01:22.683 --> 01:26.885
         No offense to myself,
         but I think you got
         the wrong guy.

01:26.887 --> 01:27.152
                        No way!

01:27.154 --> 01:32.357
      We all think it's awesome
      that you're super into
      movies, robots, He-Man.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.826
             Oh, so you're also
             a He-head?

01:33.828 --> 01:36.528
     That's the name I've given
     to die-hard He-Man fans.

01:36.530 --> 01:40.032
 That's cool.
 It's also cool that, like,

01:40.034 --> 01:42.000
 the top of your head
 smells so good.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.069
            Odd observation
            from that distance,

01:44.071 --> 01:45.704
  but I do condition every day.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.272
     It shows, bro.
                         Nice.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.207
 Such luster.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.775
                Ah, balls!
                She got to you!

01:49.777 --> 01:52.411
 No, man. We...
 We like you for you.

01:52.413 --> 01:55.180
        God, my own mom
        has to find me a table?

01:55.182 --> 01:55.981
       That's where my life is?

01:55.983 --> 01:57.382
 She gave us free waffle fries.
 You get it.

01:57.384 --> 02:02.020
         She also yelled at us
         and said that in time,
         we'd come to love you.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.723
 Mom, I don't want
 to hear any more!

02:04.725 --> 02:05.457
        Adam.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.024
            Mom,
            you ruined my life!

02:06.026 --> 02:09.495
 Schmoo, you just
 seemed so helpless
 without a place to sit.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.630
 It's my job,
 as your mama, to help.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.266
      Help?
      That's the whole problem.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.434
            If you're gonna sub
            at my school,

02:15.436 --> 02:18.470
      you have to start
      respecting my boundaries.
      Understand?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.038
 Boundaries.
 Totally get it.

02:20.040 --> 02:20.606
                  Do you?
 Boundaries.

02:20.608 --> 02:23.742
       'Cause nothing up
       to this point has led me
       to believe you do.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.376
 I get boundaries, Adam.

02:24.378 --> 02:28.413
  You don't want me
  to intervene or talk to you
  while you're at school.

02:28.415 --> 02:29.915
                  Good.
 Until I see you struggle,

02:29.917 --> 02:32.117
 and then I come in
 strong and hard.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.285
               Nope. Lost it.
 Okay, okay.

02:33.287 --> 02:36.588
 We'll limit our interactions
 to hallway snuggies...

02:36.590 --> 02:38.891
                     Mom!
 ...and brief
 Eskimo kisses.

02:38.893 --> 02:39.758
                     Mom.
 Grr. Fine.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.326
 I'll leave your little
 kitten nose alone.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.096
               Thank you.
  But at home,
  all bets are off.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.330
                     No!

02:45.332 --> 02:46.265
      <i> � I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:46.267 --> 02:50.068
       <i> � But nonetheless</i>
       <i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:52.673 --> 02:53.539
     <i> � I don't know the future</i>

02:53.541 --> 02:57.943
   <i> � But the past keeps getting</i>
   <i> clearer every day �</i>

02:58.112 --> 03:00.012
        ADULT ADAM:
        <i> It was October 12,</i>
        <i> 1980-something,</i>

03:00.014 --> 03:03.549
   <i> and my dad was coming home</i>
   <i> to a familiar frustration.</i>

03:03.551 --> 03:05.017
 Did anyone call
 while I was out?

03:05.019 --> 03:06.318
 Yeah. I wrote it down
 on the pad.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.520
  Flurt Burtman?
  Who the hell's Flurt Burtman?

03:08.522 --> 03:11.490
 I don't know.
 He was talking all fast,
 'cause it was important.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.292
 Anyway,
 call him back.
 Call who back?

03:13.294 --> 03:16.261
 If it's important,
 I need to know
 the actual name.

03:16.263 --> 03:19.031
 I don't know.
 I'm not invested,
 because it wasn't for me.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.166
 What the hell's
 this message? "PP"?

03:21.168 --> 03:21.700
 Oh, Barry wrote that.

03:21.702 --> 03:25.504
 My guess is he either
 drank too much Mr. Pibb
 or Pop Pop called?

03:25.506 --> 03:26.838
           Wait. My dad called?

03:26.840 --> 03:27.739
       He never uses the phone.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.575
      He always thinks
      the Cubans are listening.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.475
 Oh, he calls
 all the time.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.945
 He just says, "Tell the moron
 I'll call him back."

03:32.947 --> 03:35.514
 Oh, so this is me giving you
 those dozens of messages.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.383
        You know what?
        This madness stops now.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.052
        ADULT ADAM:
        <i> My dad's solution...</i>

03:40.054 --> 03:40.986
   <i> The answering machine.</i>

03:40.988 --> 03:42.688
       <i> Before voicemail,</i>
       <i> this bulky thing</i>

03:42.690 --> 03:45.857
    <i> was the best technology</i>
    <i> the '80s had to offer.</i>

03:45.859 --> 03:46.758
               Problem solved.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.995
 Holy crap! You got us
 an answering machine?

03:49.997 --> 03:51.029
 Erica, come quick!

03:51.031 --> 03:52.898
 Dad did something
 that doesn't suck!

03:52.900 --> 03:54.600
          Oh, my God!
          An answering machine?

03:54.602 --> 03:57.102
              Stop, you morons.
              It's not for you.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.338
          It's so I can finally
          get my messages.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.205
      I'm doing
      the outgoing message.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.407
 No way! I've been planning
 for this my whole life.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.377
 (AS MR. T)
 I don't want
 no jibber-jabber, foo'!

04:05.379 --> 04:06.144
 Wait for the beep!

04:06.146 --> 04:07.746
 Stay in school,
 and leave a message.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.015
 This is Mr. T,
 by the way.
 Get out of here.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.517
     (AS TONY MONTANA)
     Say hello
     to my little message.

04:12.519 --> 04:15.687
      This is Scarface,
      by the way. Cocaine.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.022

                   the message.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.357
           There's a simple one
           right here

04:18.358 --> 04:19.757
     in the instruction book.
           No! It can't be you!

04:19.760 --> 04:21.627
 (NORMAL VOICE)
 No! Don't read
 the suggested script!

04:21.629 --> 04:22.427
        That's the worst option
        of all.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.764
          Hello. You've reached
          the answering machine

04:25.766 --> 04:27.499
            of the
            Goldberg residence.

04:27.501 --> 04:31.436
      We either are unavailable
      or unable

04:31.438 --> 04:32.871
            to get to the phone
            at the moment,

04:32.873 --> 04:35.040
     but we would appreciate it
     if you would leave

04:35.042 --> 04:37.843
   your name, telephone number,
   business,

04:37.845 --> 04:42.180
 the person you're calling for,
 and the time you called

04:42.182 --> 04:44.249
       after you hear the beep.

04:44.251 --> 04:47.653
   And we will be sure
   to get back to you at our...

04:47.655 --> 04:48.920
        Come on! Everyone knows
        how to do it.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.856
 I can't take it.
 It's so long and explain-y.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.124
                  Shut up!

04:52.126 --> 04:53.825
          Earliest convenience.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.561
       (CHUCKLES) Yeah.
       I... I'm good with that.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.297
      ADULT ADAM:
      <i> As my dad got the win,</i>

04:58.299 --> 05:00.599
    <i> I was still a lone loser</i>
    <i> without a table.</i>

05:00.601 --> 05:02.334
     <i> My only choice</i>
     <i> was to accept my fate</i>

05:02.336 --> 05:03.902
      <i> of eating alone</i>
      <i> under the bleachers.</i>

05:03.904 --> 05:07.639
 <i> That is, until I stumbled upon</i>
 <i> my salvation.</i>

05:07.641 --> 05:09.841
              Holy motherboard.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.176
  <i> The high-school computer lab.</i>

05:11.178 --> 05:13.412
  <i> It had six state-of-the-art</i>
  <i> Apple IIs,</i>

05:13.414 --> 05:17.549
 <i> each with double floppy drives</i>
 <i> and a dot-matrix printer</i>

05:17.551 --> 05:19.685
 <i> that could ink a</i>
 <i> whopping six lines per minute</i>

05:19.687 --> 05:22.220
 <i> on that weird paper</i>
 <i> where you rip off the sides.</i>

05:22.222 --> 05:24.222
   We're allowed
   to be in here.
              Okay.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.692
  Mr. Glascott says we can stay
  the whole lunch period

05:26.694 --> 05:27.959
            as long as we don't
            make crumbs,

05:27.961 --> 05:30.962
   which is why I bring
   a thermos of soup every day.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.264
        Cool.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.598
 Whoa. Is that
 <i> Prince of Persia?</i>

05:33.600 --> 05:36.435
          We've got it all...
          <i> Castle Wolfenstein,</i>
          <i> Lode Runner,</i>

05:36.437 --> 05:39.938
    <i> Choplifter,</i>  and <i> Ultima,</i>
    parts I, II, III, and IV.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.674
 You have part IV?
 That's the ultimate "Ultima"!

05:42.676 --> 05:44.776
           You know your stuff.
 I'm Adam, by the way.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.912
        I'm Mike Levy.
        This is also Mike Levy.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.080
 You guys have
 the same name?

05:48.082 --> 05:49.981
              Yeah, but Mike Z.
              is painfully shy,

05:49.983 --> 05:51.550
               so it's not much
               of an issue.

05:51.552 --> 05:55.454
 I feel your pain.
 There's a senior also
 named Adam Goldberg.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.756
 He's not happy
 to have me around.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.457
           (CHUCKLES) Right on.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.625

06:10.003 --> 06:13.238
  The answers to all our

        and end this,
        once and for all.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.118
        ROBOTIC VOICE:
        <i> No new messages.</i>

12:33.120 --> 12:35.420
 ADULT ADAM: <i> My sister</i>
 <i> was determined to end the war.</i>

12:35.422 --> 12:39.958
 <i> Meanwhile, my mom</i>
 <i> set off a nuclear bomb</i>
 <i> of embarrassment at school.</i>

12:39.960 --> 12:41.392
               There's the guy.
               Watch out.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.994
       It's the Fighting Quaker
       of the Month.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.230
 How is this a thing?
 What's happening to me?

12:45.232 --> 12:46.664
        What is happening is
        you're being celebrated

12:46.666 --> 12:49.434
  for your popularity
  amongst your fellow students.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.902
          And one of
          the delightful spoils

12:50.904 --> 12:54.105
         is that you get to sit
         at this special table.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.440
       It's for cool kids only.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.710
 First of all, I like eating
 in the computer lab.

12:58.712 --> 13:01.379
 Also, my mom clearly
 put you up to this.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.981
             (LAUGHS)
             Popular and funny.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.250
 Whatever. I'm going back
 to my computer game.

13:05.252 --> 13:08.019
 And I'm taking
 this disaster with me.

13:09.055 --> 13:12.223
 Where is he going?
 Why isn't he sitting
 at his cool new table?

13:12.225 --> 13:14.692
 Did you screw the pooch
 on this one, Andre?

13:14.694 --> 13:16.361
                  No! Probably.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.196
              Look. If the kid
              won't accept help

13:18.198 --> 13:20.398
            from his super-cool
            guidance counselor,

13:20.400 --> 13:22.634
                 then he's just
                 a lost cause.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.737
      ADULT ADAM:
      <i> But my mom</i>
      <i> was never one to give up.</i>

13:25.739 --> 13:27.705
     <i> When it came</i>
     <i> to her little schmoo,</i>

13:27.707 --> 13:31.142
    <i> she always had the drive</i>
    <i> to succeed.</i>

13:33.079 --> 13:35.647
         Oh, Beverly,
         you're so "Krafty".

13:35.649 --> 13:37.015
           (LAUGHS)

13:37.017 --> 13:38.850
           Say cheese.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.186
      MAN: I think we found
      the problem.

13:41.188 --> 13:44.189
 Looks like someone
 wanted a little cheese
 with their Apple.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.291
                  Nailed it.
          BALL: Oh, come on.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.927
        The sign clearly states
        no food in here.

13:48.929 --> 13:52.630
       You kids know the rules.
       You are banned
       for lunch hours.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.032
 But where are we
 supposed to go?

13:54.034 --> 13:56.334
           In the cafeteria
           with the normals.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.236
            Yeah, I said it.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.470
 Come on.
 I'll cut you a check.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.273
 No! You can't send us back
 in the wild!

14:02.275 --> 14:03.908
 We've been domesticated.

14:03.910 --> 14:04.542
              Guys, guys, guys.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.812
 I think the silver lining here
 is that Mike Z. talked.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.414
 You shut it!
 Shut it, Goldberg!

14:09.416 --> 14:11.716
 You know, it's kind of funny
 how the drive got cheese

14:11.718 --> 14:14.118
 just after you
 joined our crew.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.754
           Mike, Mike, it's me.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.323
              I... I wouldn't
              cheese the drive.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.758
         Well, me and Mike Levy
         are kosher.
 Way of life!

14:20.760 --> 14:23.328
 And Rog, Mink, and Alvie
 are lactose-intolerant.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.196
 Come at me!
         But every day,

14:25.198 --> 14:28.132
 you eat the same turkey
 and cheese sandwich.

14:28.134 --> 14:28.733
 Get some!

14:28.735 --> 14:32.136
        That is the lunch
        my mom always makes me.

14:33.607 --> 14:34.672
                    Mom!

14:34.674 --> 14:35.406
         (CROWD GROANS)

14:35.408 --> 14:38.142
 Boy, Al, we are lucky
 to get these seats.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.677
            Yep. Pure luck.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.379
          Oh, look who it is!

14:41.381 --> 14:44.515
   Hey, is that Pops and Father
   over there?

14:44.517 --> 14:48.152
         Well, this is a very
         unplanned coincidence.

14:48.154 --> 14:48.786
     Damn it.
                    Damn it.

14:48.788 --> 14:51.689
 Hey, now you two can talk
 in person like normal humans.

14:51.691 --> 14:52.790
 Pop Pop,
 let's trade seats.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.692
          That is a crap trade,
          and you know it.

14:54.694 --> 14:55.493
                 Mur, sit here.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.428
 I'm fine here on the end.
 Thank you.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.398
  Hey, Bar, tell Murray to flag
  down the soft pretzel guy.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.701
  Erica, tell Pops to tell Dad,
  Pop Pop wants a pretzel.

15:03.703 --> 15:09.374
    Um, Pops, tell Dad that
    Pop Pop would appreciate it
    if he bought him a pretzel.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.843
        Murray,
        buy your dad a pretzel.

15:11.845 --> 15:14.579
 Tell him to buy
 his own damn pretzel!

15:14.581 --> 15:15.380
             No go, Erica.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.416
 Barry, Dad kindly declines
 the pretzel purchasing.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.252
 Pop Pop, Dad said to get bent
 and buy your own.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.720
            I wasn't asking
            for a free pretzel.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.757
   Tell that ungrateful bastard
   he still owes me $17.

15:25.759 --> 15:26.557
           He can take it
           out of my tab.

15:26.559 --> 15:30.094
            Erica, Pop Pop said
            Dad's a bastard,
            and he wants a Tab.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.130
            Pops, Pop Pop wants
            a diet soda.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.233
      Murray, will you
      buy your dad a diet soda?

15:35.235 --> 15:38.036
           At the very least,
           it'll calm him down.

15:38.038 --> 15:38.269
    Fine!

15:38.271 --> 15:43.441
    Excuse me. Let me get
    a pretzel and a Tab
    for the old guy on the end.

15:43.877 --> 15:46.244
 Here.
    Here.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.979
        Here.
            Here.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.380
          What the (BLEEP)
          is this!

15:49.382 --> 15:50.648
    I don't drink ladies' soda.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.783
            Where's my pretzel?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.484
 It appears Dad
 is eating it.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.852
           You give your father
           a message,

15:54.854 --> 15:56.354
             and you tell him
             every single word.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.990
        ADULT ADAM:
        <i> Yep. Dad and Pop Pop</i>
        <i> were finally talking.</i>

15:58.992 --> 16:01.392
   <i> Only problem,</i>
   <i> they were using their family</i>

16:01.394 --> 16:03.995
     <i> as their telephone</i>
     <i> and answering machine.</i>

16:03.997 --> 16:04.696
                  That's right.

16:04.698 --> 16:07.398
        This woman cheesed
        the drive, not us. Her!

16:07.400 --> 16:09.200
      Whoa!
      That's a harsh accusation

16:09.202 --> 16:11.869
     against a faculty member
     who's here one day a week.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.438
 It's true. She cheesed it.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.773
 It's her signature
 culinary move.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.542
      Beverly, do you have
      anything to say?

16:17.544 --> 16:19.243
 I vehemently deny
 cheesing the drive

16:19.245 --> 16:20.678
 under cover of darkness
 when no one was here.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.182
      She said "vehemently."
      That's a big word.
      So I have to believe her.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.917
        Fine. If she's
        not gonna own up to it,

16:25.919 --> 16:30.221
     then I'd like to log
     an official complaint
     against this teacher, sir.

16:30.223 --> 16:30.888
       You mean your mom?

16:30.890 --> 16:32.590
 She's been harassing
 one of the students.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.058
              You?
 I don't see you writing!

16:34.060 --> 16:35.526
 Don't write it down, Andre.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.394
 Write it down, Andre!

16:36.396 --> 16:38.229
 Report the snuggies
 and the kisses,

16:38.231 --> 16:40.064
 both butterfly
 and Eskimo.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.699
             You Eskimo'd
             on school grounds?

16:41.701 --> 16:44.369
         Ooh! I gotta write it.
         I just have to.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.838
 School grounds or not,
 I am your mother,

16:46.840 --> 16:49.374
 and I have the legal right
 to snug, squish,

16:49.376 --> 16:52.410
 and kiss you like we're in
 an igloo as much as I want.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.812
    According to the school
    handbook, you really don't.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.915
       Oh, so it's almost as if
       there are boundaries

16:57.917 --> 16:59.550
         that no one can cross.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.487
      Check and mate.
      He's got you there, lady.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.888
 Adam, I just wanted you...

17:03.890 --> 17:05.490
                 Bup, bup, bup!
                 Boundaries!

17:05.492 --> 17:06.557
 You expect me
 to just sit...

17:06.559 --> 17:08.026
          Bup, bup! Boundaries!
 I just want...

17:08.028 --> 17:09.961
 Just give...

   to respect his...

 I know what he wants!

           You know,
           I was actually happy
           in the computer lab.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.071
        Those guys accepted me.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.839
              You always say
              you want to help,

17:22.842 --> 17:25.943
            but you just end up
            ruining everything.

       <i> to clean things up.</i>

17:36.489 --> 17:39.590
 Not so fast, Atkins. This is
 a random locker search.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.793
 If it's random, why are you
 targeting the guy

17:41.795 --> 17:46.364
 most likely to have a doobie
 hidden in his locker behind
 a Trapper Keeper?

 It is, which is why
 I'll offer you a plea bargain.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.007
        You take the fall
        for cheesing the drive,

17:56.009 --> 17:57.508
        and this all goes away.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.576
 I don't know
 what you just said,

17:58.578 --> 18:01.946
 and maybe that's 'cause
 I've been hitting
 my Trapper Keeper,

18:01.948 --> 18:02.447
 but I'm in.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.515

 Adam who?

18:06.719 --> 18:09.353
     You know, the freshman.
     You call him a nerd loser.

 to like 40 dudes.

       and the glasses.

 just touched a nerd.

 of the answering machine?

18:31.277 --> 18:34.245

 but I erased the tape.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.618
         Why would you do that?

18:40.620 --> 18:41.853
 Because you were
 hogging the phone,

18:41.855 --> 18:44.188
 talking to your dad
 but not actually talking.

 not talking is how you talk.

  we ambushed you at the game.

 would like to talk for real,

   your machine better,
   then I won't stop you.

18:55.768 --> 18:59.470

     We never were big talkers.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.671
     Well...

 I'd just come over.

 worth of soft pretzels.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.487
  I wanted the money in cash.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.490
             But the game's on.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.593
              You could come in
              and, uh, watch.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.930
 Sure.
 I got nothing better to do.

19:26.966 --> 19:30.101
  Lucky for you boys, the real
  culprit stepped forward.

19:30.103 --> 19:34.172
 The lab's all yours again.
 Don't make crumbs.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.072
        (BOYS CHEERING)

19:35.074 --> 19:37.642
 Hey, sorry we blamed you
 for cheesing the drive.

19:37.644 --> 19:41.179
    It's cool. I'm just glad
    we're back where we belong.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.981
 ADULT ADAM:
 <i> From that point on,</i>
 <i> I couldn't wait for lunchtime.</i>

19:43.983 --> 19:48.819
     <i> And it was all thanks</i>
     <i> to someone who cared</i>
     <i> a little too much.</i>

19:49.222 --> 19:51.155
           Hey.
           Heard the good news.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.824
 Stop. I know
 you fixed this for me,

19:53.826 --> 19:56.794
 but wouldn't you say
 framing a kid

19:56.796 --> 19:59.697
 kind of crosses
 every boundary ever?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.365
             God, you're right.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.802
       I am horrible
       with boundaries, boopie.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.705
     But I'll try to do better.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.608
 Well, I'll let
 this one time slide.

20:10.610 --> 20:15.079
 But, to be clear,
 the "no snuggling"
 policy still stands.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.084
 ADULT ADAM: <i> In that moment,</i>
 <i> I realized that I had a mother</i>

20:20.086 --> 20:23.254
        <i> who would cross</i>
        <i> any boundary for me.</i>

20:25.291 --> 20:25.690
 Starting now.

20:25.692 --> 20:29.794
 ADULT ADAM: <i> And that made me</i>
 <i> the luckiest kid in the world.</i>

20:29.796 --> 20:31.262
          There's too much salt
          on the pretzels.

20:31.264 --> 20:34.165
 What are you talking about?
 Salt makes the pretzel.

20:34.167 --> 20:34.632
            Salt makes you die.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.668
 ADULT ADAM:
 <i> 'Cause, at the end of the day,</i>
 <i> walls need to be broken,</i>

20:37.670 --> 20:40.338
     <i> and boundaries need</i>
     <i> to be crossed...</i>
              Yeah!

20:40.340 --> 20:43.241
         <i> ...in order for love</i>
         <i> to get through.</i>

20:47.347 --> 20:49.380
        (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

20:49.382 --> 20:51.148
            (DINGS)

20:54.587 --> 20:56.621
 BARRY: <i> Hi.</i>
 <i> You've reached the Goldbergs.</i>

20:56.623 --> 20:57.955
       <i> Leave a message.</i>
             (BEEPS)

20:57.957 --> 20:59.490
        Hey. I got a flat tire,
        and I need...

20:59.492 --> 21:02.393
     <i> Ha! It's not the answering</i>
     <i> machine, you dumb idiot!</i>

21:02.395 --> 21:04.028
   <i> It's actually me... Barry.</i>

21:04.030 --> 21:05.796
         (SIGHS)
         It's me. I need Dad...

21:05.798 --> 21:09.100
     <i> Gotcha again! It is</i>
     <i> the answering machine.</i>

21:09.102 --> 21:09.900
               <i> Leave a message.</i>
                        (BEEPS)

21:09.902 --> 21:12.303
 Damn it! I've got a flat tire,
 and I need Dad...

21:12.305 --> 21:14.772
       <i> No, it's actually me,</i>
       <i> Barry, for real.</i>

21:14.774 --> 21:15.539
    <i> So, what's the deal?</i>

21:15.541 --> 21:17.842
     Barry, I will kill you!
     Put Dad on the...

21:17.844 --> 21:20.645
 <i> But, seriously,</i>
 <i> leave a message at the beep.</i>

21:20.647 --> 21:22.146
           (BEEPS)

21:26.052 --> 21:27.385
     Dad, I've got a flat...

21:27.387 --> 21:30.888
    <i> Oh, my God.</i>
    <i> You're a dumb sack of crap.</i>
