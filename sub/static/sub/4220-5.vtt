WEBVTT

00:00.793 --> 00:03.127
Gabby is gonna be one
hell of a firefighter.

00:03.587 --> 00:05.338
Can the two of you
separate your
personal feelings

00:05.422 --> 00:07.048
from your professional
responsibilities?

00:07.424 --> 00:09.801
If you didn't think this
was a good idea,
would you tell me?

00:09.968 --> 00:11.636
Uh, I'm looking for
a Sylvie Brett.

00:11.720 --> 00:12.720
Harrison?

00:12.888 --> 00:15.264
I'm sorry I called off the
wedding and I want you back.

00:15.391 --> 00:16.599
Please come home.

00:17.101 --> 00:19.811
You know, how you spend
your time off shift,
that's your business.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.688
But people in this house
count on you.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.606
You know what
I can count on?
No one.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.818
So why don't you
and everyone else in this
house just leave me alone?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.702
Hi. I'm looking for my
niece and her mother.

00:35.786 --> 00:39.163
The little girl's 12 years
old. Never mind, I see her.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.126
Hey, there she is.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.962
Hi, Uncle Matt.
Thanks for coming.

00:46.505 --> 00:47.797
Where's your mom?

00:49.216 --> 00:51.259
Violet, you said your
mom was gonna be here.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.760
What's going on?

00:55.222 --> 00:56.514
Hey, look at me.

01:00.978 --> 01:01.978
Violet?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.021
My mom doesn't
know I'm here.

01:04.148 --> 01:05.148
What happened to you?

01:06.316 --> 01:09.652
I had a fight at school.
I can't tell Mom because
I'm already in trouble.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.613
Can you sign it for me?

01:17.661 --> 01:18.953
What happened to
the Latin School?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.289
I had to switch
when we moved.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.874
You moved?

01:24.042 --> 01:25.209
Can you sign it or not?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.008
Yeah, I'll sign it.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.932
Come on, Sylvie.
Come home with me.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.477
I told you, I just...

01:42.853 --> 01:44.645
I need to think
about all of this.

01:45.731 --> 01:46.814
You know how I feel.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.067
I do. I just...

01:51.236 --> 01:52.779
Don't know why.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.490
I mean, what changed?

01:56.492 --> 01:58.534
These last few months
without you,

02:00.162 --> 02:02.330
it's not something I ever
wanna get used to.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.302
I have to go back
to Fowlerton today,
take care of a few things.

02:17.554 --> 02:21.182
Maybe close the deal on
the Darlington house.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.101
You really made
an offer on it?

02:25.270 --> 02:28.564
I can back out at
any time. I'm just
hoping I don't have to.

02:31.443 --> 02:32.902
Oh, I'm late.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.369
Hey! Hey, how was breakfast?

02:41.537 --> 02:43.663
Get this. Christie and Jim
have jammed Violet

02:43.747 --> 02:45.289
into some huge public school

02:45.374 --> 02:47.083
in Logan Square
where they now live.

02:48.877 --> 02:49.877
When did all this happen?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.587
Must have been recently,

02:51.672 --> 02:53.089
but Christie never said
anything about it.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.968
I should know this stuff.
I'm a terrible brother.

02:57.135 --> 03:00.513
Hey, no, you're not.
You're definitely not.

03:02.641 --> 03:03.641
Yeah.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.864
Let me guess. Bad clams?

03:20.075 --> 03:21.075
Hung over.

03:24.246 --> 03:27.373
Truck 81,
Squad Three, Ambulance 61,

03:27.499 --> 03:31.043
structure fire at the
1400 block of Ogden
at Washington Avenue.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.807
Ah, jeez.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.434
Otis!

03:46.685 --> 03:47.685
Sorry, my bad!

03:49.313 --> 03:51.147
How long till you can
drive again?

03:51.315 --> 03:52.440
Ten weeks.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.129
This is my building!
You gotta do something!

04:15.339 --> 04:16.339
Anybody inside?

04:16.423 --> 04:18.966
I don't know. There were
men working on the
upper two floors.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.594
Primary search on the sixth
floor. Let's go!

04:21.678 --> 04:23.137
Main entrance is around
the corner!

04:23.221 --> 04:25.681
We'll check out the
fifth floor. Cruz,
extend the aerial.

04:25.849 --> 04:26.849
On it.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.100
All right, I'll take Dawson
and vent the roof.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.187
You clear the fifth floor.
Dawson and I will vent
the roof.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.358
Whatever you say, Lieutenant.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.703
Clear.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.765
Damn it!

05:09.434 --> 05:12.061
Casey, Dawson, are
you clear on the roof?
We gotta move this aerial.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.452
Herrmann, you got
a victim on the fifth
floor balcony, north side.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.662
Can you get to him?

05:29.746 --> 05:33.416
That's a negative.
Hallway is obstructed.
We can't get past the middle.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.794
Casey, you two good
on the roof? I gotta
move this aerial.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.214
Copy that. We're good.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.728
Are you okay?

06:37.022 --> 06:38.731
Squad Three,
Truck 81, report.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.900
Fifth floor is clear.
We're coming out.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.611
North end of the building
is flashing over, Chief.
We gotta pull back.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.571
Copy that.
Where's Lieutenant Casey?

06:45.697 --> 06:47.698
He's venting
the roof with Dawson.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.951
Casey, Dawson, I want
you off that roof. Now!

06:51.078 --> 06:52.078
Copy that, Chief.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.080
Cruz, get that aerial
back up there now.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.164
Copy, Chief.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.838
Uh, situation is
deteriorating, Chief.
We can't get to the aerial.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.132
Can you make it to
a safe location?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.844
Negative, Chief. We're gonna
have to use our bailout gear.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.598
Relax.
You've trained for this.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.600
It's no different
than at the academy.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.906
You good?
Yeah.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.282
Okay.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.827
Can somebody please tell me
why our truck lieutenant
is venting the roof?

07:50.387 --> 07:51.387
Hang on!

07:52.848 --> 07:54.223
You okay?
I'm okay.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.599
Keep moving.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.319
I've got a,
I've got a problem.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.445
What is it?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.781
This, this cable is
stuck in my DCD.

08:10.866 --> 08:11.866
I can't move.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.410
All right, don't panic.
You got your cutters?

08:15.871 --> 08:16.829
Yeah.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.289
Okay, I want you to
cut the black cable.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.415
Black cable.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.045
And with your right hand,
I want you to pull as much
of your weight

08:25.130 --> 08:29.091
as you can onto the rope,
then yank the cable out
of your DCD with your left.

08:29.676 --> 08:30.759
Okay.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.767
It's not working!
It's not working!

08:38.852 --> 08:42.146
Come on, Gabby, you can
do this. Pull your
weight onto the rope,

08:42.606 --> 08:44.440
and just pop that
cable free.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.485
I got it.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.613
Good job. Ready?

09:04.961 --> 09:05.961
You okay?

09:06.129 --> 09:08.047
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.723
Hey, Mills. Hey, look, I got
a job coming up after shift.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.141
I could use a
second set of eyes.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.893
What kind of job?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.145
Nothing you can't handle.
And it pays well.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.813
You can ride a jet-ski, right?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.609
Uh, you know what?

09:28.818 --> 09:31.487
Thank you for thinking of
me, but I, I got a lot
of stuff going on, man...

09:31.613 --> 09:32.738
It's an open invite.
All right?

09:32.822 --> 09:35.241
You just let me know
when you're ready to
make an extra three bills.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.326
Wait, uh, how much?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.410
It won't be long.

09:38.995 --> 09:39.995
Okay.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.957
Herrmann, you want to
fill in as acting lieutenant
for half an hour?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.041
I have a little
personal business.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.126
Uh, yeah, sure. I guess.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.503
Good luck.
Thanks.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.675
Watch out, boys.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.177
Severide's looking for
drinking buddies for
tomorrow night.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.930
Again? My liver's still mad
at me for Friday.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.599
That guy ought to spend a
quiet night at home for once.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.726
Yeah, well, get
your excuses ready.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.855
Yo, Truck 81, that bathroom's
looking like a war zone.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.983
Yo, Capp, we're not
on bathroom duty.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.109
It's Squad's month.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.277
Says who?

10:11.361 --> 10:14.196
Says me, Acting
Lieutenant of Truck 81.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.116
Guess that settles that.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.244
Joe Cruz. See you a minute?

10:24.207 --> 10:26.625
Chief, I know I put Dawson
and Casey in a tight
spot up there, but...

10:26.710 --> 10:27.710
No, no, no, no, no.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.212
Joe, what you did
out there was exemplary work.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.548
Your quick thinking
saved that man's life.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.177
Thank you, Chief.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.262
Hmm.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.346
Just glad I saw him
when I did.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.435
It was good running
that truck again.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.105
Even if it wasn't from
the driver's seat.

10:59.909 --> 11:00.993
Hey, Christie.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.620
Matt! What a surprise.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.081
Uh, come on in.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.333
Thanks.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.419
So, uh...

11:13.798 --> 11:14.923
What happened to the house?

11:15.884 --> 11:18.510
We've just had to do
a little belt tightening.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.845
How did you find us?

11:20.430 --> 11:23.432
I got your address off
Violet's detention slip.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.768
She got into
a fight, Christie.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.230
That damn school. They're
supposed to be keeping an
eye on this situation.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.607
This isn't the first fight?

11:32.442 --> 11:36.111
We're on top of it. Jim and
I have been down there, we're
gonna go again, believe me.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.447
What's going on
with you guys?

11:40.033 --> 11:42.659
It's nothing. Just a
few bad investments.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.912
I really need to call
the school right now.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.038
I'm worried about
you, Christie.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.916
You don't have to be.

11:49.459 --> 11:52.086
I'm your brother.
Let me help you.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.963
Just don't worry about us.
We're gonna be fine.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.471
Hey.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.722
Hey.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.850
Uh, a bunch of us
are going out tomorrow
night, if you wanna come.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.812
Oh, wait, don't you have a
friend in town or something?

12:10.146 --> 12:12.898
My fiancé.
Ex, my ex-fiancé.

12:13.608 --> 12:16.360
Actually, I'm not
real sure what he is
to me at the moment.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.071
I slept with him.

12:20.907 --> 12:21.949
Ah.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.327
You just got more than
you bargained for,
didn't you?

12:26.496 --> 12:27.830
Does that mean you guys
are back together?

12:29.541 --> 12:31.667
Well, he lives
in Fowlerton, so...

12:34.170 --> 12:35.462
You going back there?

12:35.630 --> 12:38.173
No. No, no, no. No.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.677
Good.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.096
Yep.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.185
What, what are you doing?

12:51.020 --> 12:52.396
I'm wiping it down
like you told me.

12:52.522 --> 12:58.110
It's not polish, Dawson,
it's wax. You gotta let it
dry to a haze first,

12:58.194 --> 13:00.195
Ahhh.
then buff it out.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.280
Right.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.031
You can move to another
section while you wait.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.533
Then I'm gonna talk you
through the rims.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.410
They gotta shine like
the day they were made.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.538
You're relieved, Lieutenant.
I need to borrow
Dawson for a minute.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.708
Uh, I'm in the middle
of something.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.668
Herrmann, finish up, will you?

13:16.754 --> 13:19.089
Yeah, sure.
Absolutely, Lieutenant.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.549
Take as much
time as you need.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.927
I'm...
Christie and Jim
are basically broke.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.596
They've gotta get their act
together, you know?

13:26.014 --> 13:26.972
I know. But...

13:27.056 --> 13:32.019
I tried to offer help, money,
or something, but she's...
Embarrassed?

13:32.395 --> 13:34.897
Proud? I don't know.
Maybe you can talk to her?

13:35.106 --> 13:36.982
Can we deal with this
another time?

13:38.359 --> 13:40.819
I didn't always have
Christie in my life.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.198
Our mom brought us back
together because she wanted us
to be there for each other,

13:44.574 --> 13:46.909
and I don't feel like
I've held up my end
of the bargain.

13:48.077 --> 13:51.622
Okay, um, well, if Christie's
too proud to take the
money, give it to Jim.

13:52.582 --> 13:53.916
Thank you.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.794
Uh, Herrmann, maybe it's
none of our business,

13:57.879 --> 14:01.465
but how is it that
you're waxing the Chief's
buggy and not Dawson?

14:02.091 --> 14:06.970
I got busted down from acting
lieutenant all the way to
candidate in one fell swoop.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.097
Hey, sorry about that.
I can take over.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.933
Nah. Don't worry
about it, I got it.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.851
Go on, go canoodle
with your lieutenant.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.605
Eighty-One, in the truck.
We're taking a ride.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.159
Matt!

14:29.244 --> 14:30.202
Hey.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.287
Hey. Uh, what are
you doing here?

14:33.164 --> 14:37.584
Uh, listen, I was speaking
to Christie earlier about
Violet's school situation.

14:38.044 --> 14:41.004
Um, I, I don't
want you to take this
the wrong way,

14:41.130 --> 14:44.007
but if there's any chance
of getting Violet back
into her old school,

14:44.092 --> 14:46.760
I'd be happy to pitch in.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.470
That's a nice offer, but,

14:49.556 --> 14:52.224
you know what, I think
things are gonna level out
a bit once we're done

14:52.350 --> 14:55.602
with mediation and
that divorce is,
you know, finalized.

14:56.646 --> 14:57.896
Divorce?

14:58.898 --> 14:59.898
What, she didn't tell you?

15:01.776 --> 15:02.776
Jim, what happened?

15:03.528 --> 15:06.071
You know, lots of little
things piling up over
the years.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.241
And financial problems
certainly take their toll.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.578
We have got to find
a new coffee place,
babe. That line is just...

15:19.669 --> 15:21.628
Jim, is everything okay?

15:22.755 --> 15:25.173
Why wouldn't
everything be okay?

15:27.802 --> 15:28.885
Matt...

15:33.349 --> 15:34.683
You're a real
piece of work.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.322
She called him "babe."

15:48.531 --> 15:50.240
I think it's a safe bet
they're sleeping together.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.827
I mean, you're probably
right, but maybe Christie
already knows.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.122
Maybe. But I don't like it.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.791
Baby, I wouldn't read
too much into this.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.293
Divorce makes
people act crazy.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.462
That's my point.
Something's up.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.922
And what do we really
know about Jim anyway?

16:07.258 --> 16:09.176
I want to check this guy out.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.719
Let's get Antonio involved.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.929
Mmm, he and Laura are...

16:13.556 --> 16:16.099
They're going through the
same thing right now.
I'd leave him out of it.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.894
Wait, what about, um,
what's his name, Halstead?

16:20.229 --> 16:24.399
Mmm. Better idea. You know,
um, Adam Ruzek?

16:25.234 --> 16:27.110
Mmm-hmm.
Antonio trusts him.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.863
I'll reach out.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.911
Oh, oh, oh! It's not
gonna work.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.624
Look, Joe.

16:43.086 --> 16:47.172
We need to have a
talk, okay, before
this turns into a thing.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.716
Now, I know how important
driving the truck is to you.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.387
No, Otis...
But I didn't ask to
be your replacement.

16:53.721 --> 16:57.182
Right? Now, uh,
when the starting
quarterback gets hurt,

16:57.392 --> 17:00.602
the coach has to put
in the backup QB.
That's just the way it is.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.188
It's no time for
bruised egos, Cruz.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.981
We're all one team, man.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.068
I say this as a friend.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.364
The engine needs to be
running in order to get
an accurate level

17:12.615 --> 17:14.574
on the transmission fluid.

17:15.952 --> 17:16.952
Hmm.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.457
Incredible!

17:23.042 --> 17:24.292
She did it again.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.254
She left the flippin'
compartment door open.

17:27.505 --> 17:28.964
So say something then.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.550
What's the point? Casey's just
gonna tell me to close it.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.014
Would all those involved with
Molly's please follow me?

17:41.394 --> 17:42.394
Uh-oh.
Okay.

17:51.529 --> 17:55.031
Approximately how long
can I expect my beautiful
firehouse to be

17:55.199 --> 17:56.825
defiled by this atrocity?

17:57.160 --> 18:02.581
Sorry, Chief. It's not exactly
running at the moment.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.499
We'll get it out
of here. Soon.

18:04.584 --> 18:08.503
I hope so, or you
will have bigger problems
than a few parking tickets.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.183
160 bucks.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.062
I can totally take
care of these.

18:30.818 --> 18:31.902
I got those forms for
you, Chief.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.111
Perfect, thank you.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.196
Chief, you got a sec?

18:37.033 --> 18:38.033
Connie, may I?

18:43.873 --> 18:49.336
Uh, Chief, uh, you know
how I don't like going
outside the chain of command.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.129
Uh-huh.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.840
But this situation
with Dawson...

18:56.886 --> 18:57.886
Go on.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.389
You're gonna make
me say it?

19:01.849 --> 19:02.849
Oh, God.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.393
Chief, it ain't working!

19:05.520 --> 19:08.438
I mean, you saw it, all right?

19:08.731 --> 19:12.359
Casey's venting the
roof so he can look
out for her?

19:12.443 --> 19:14.820
I mean, how many
candidates has he had?

19:14.904 --> 19:17.239
You ever see him vent
the roof with one?

19:17.615 --> 19:20.784
May I remind you what it was
like around here in the
wake of Shay's death?

19:21.536 --> 19:24.579
A big reason we're getting
past that is Dawson's decision
to stay on at ambulance.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.747
We owe her.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.624
Absolutely.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.669
But when you rewarded
her with a spot on
81, you didn't ask

19:30.753 --> 19:34.548
any of us how we felt about
having a candidate date
our lieutenant.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.259
And we're the ones
that gotta deal with it.

19:39.679 --> 19:44.349
I have absolute faith
that you will find a
way to deal with it.

19:46.269 --> 19:49.312
Got it, Chief.
Message received.

20:07.915 --> 20:08.915
What do we got?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.293
Guy could use some
medical attention.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.426
Hmm, get ready.

20:19.927 --> 20:20.927
What is he on?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.220
You're the medic.

20:22.305 --> 20:25.557
So, what, you call us here
to help cut down on
your paperwork?

20:25.641 --> 20:27.642
Can't click a guy up
for rocking a banana
hammock.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.478
Chicago's finest, huh?

20:31.981 --> 20:32.981
You got a name,
big fella?

20:34.025 --> 20:35.025
Hey! Hey!

20:39.655 --> 20:41.364
Come on. Yeah.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.084
Ten milligrams of Versed
to help him sleep?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.879
Against regulations.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.179
Nice and easy. We're
gonna take care
of you, okay?

21:06.015 --> 21:07.015
Ahhh!

21:21.781 --> 21:23.657
The hell with regulation.

21:27.078 --> 21:29.788
Oh, man. Good looking out.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.542
What you got going on today?

21:34.835 --> 21:36.836
Nothing, man. I'm gonna go
home, sit on the couch...

21:36.921 --> 21:39.172
Hey, guys. You coming tonight?

21:39.715 --> 21:41.216
Tipsy Tuesday at
McGillicuddy's.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.677
Tonight.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.388
Uh, you know what?
I got this thing.
I can't even...

21:46.514 --> 21:48.473
Whatever. You guys suck.

21:53.479 --> 21:57.399
Oh, oh, yeah. My nephews
are gonna come visit
the house next shift!

21:58.359 --> 22:00.777
Hmm, that's exciting
news, apparently.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.530
Oh, they get to see
me drive the truck.
No offense.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.782
They're gonna
lose their minds!

22:07.743 --> 22:08.910
Hey, good for you, bro.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.664
Well, look at this.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.749
It must be Christmas
or something.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.251
Hiya, Trudy.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.585
Morning, Sergeant.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.130
I'm meeting Adam
Ruzek down here.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.923
That's him, right there.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.425
Thank you.

22:24.552 --> 22:27.762
What's the deal? He need
a grown up to hold his
hand on the walk down here?

22:27.930 --> 22:31.182
Oh, no, I just thought
I'd pop by to see you.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.518
That's nice. I like that.

22:35.021 --> 22:39.733
Oh, and, and then
there's this bit of
unpleasant business.

22:39.942 --> 22:42.027
Ooh, parking tickets.
The worst.

22:42.111 --> 22:47.073
Right? I thought I could
get a little assistance
dealing with these.

22:47.283 --> 22:51.536
Sure. Just go down the
stairs, take a left, and the
cashier is at window five.

22:53.706 --> 22:57.500
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.627
You come by any time.

23:02.298 --> 23:05.133
I realize this is a
big ask, and you don't
owe me anything,

23:05.301 --> 23:07.052
but my sister isn't
thinking straight
right now.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.304
I just need to know
what's really going on.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.598
Hmm, fair enough. What's, uh,
what's Jim's last name again?

23:11.807 --> 23:13.892
Jim Jordan.
Jordan Development.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.019
Jordan Development.
All right.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.104
Okay, I will do
some poking around.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.565
I can't run a wire or
anything like that, but
I can figure out a lot

23:20.649 --> 23:21.649
without getting too dirty.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.610
All right, thanks. I owe you.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.570
Yeah. All right, man.
I'll get back to you,
all right?

23:25.654 --> 23:26.654
Okay.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.324
Thanks for seeing me, Chief.

23:29.575 --> 23:30.742
How's Gretchen doing?

23:30.826 --> 23:35.121
Great. Working at some fancy
store on Mag Mile while she
finishes up her degree.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.248
Well, good for her. Give
her my best, will you?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.667
Uh, I want to talk
about Joe Cruz.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.295
He had a hell
of a save yesterday, and

23:43.672 --> 23:45.340
I'd like him back
behind the wheel.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.050
He's on three
months suspension.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.845
I realize that. But you and
I both know he was not
at fault in that crash.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.057
He really stepped up,
and I believe he should
be rewarded for that.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.518
Hmm, so put in for
a commendation.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.814
Driving is what really
matters to him.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.524
There's nothing I can do.

24:05.236 --> 24:10.448
Okay. But you do know
I may take this upstairs.

24:11.534 --> 24:14.035
Rattling cages like that
takes a toll on your career.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.540
You ready to risk that just
because your guy really
wants to drive the truck?

24:23.462 --> 24:27.465
I do my job, I do it well.
When I punch out,
that's my business.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.385
Yeah, it most certainly is.

24:30.511 --> 24:33.721
Everybody's on my ass for
the drinking, but I, I
don't bring that to work.

24:35.057 --> 24:39.644
My point is, I do my
job, and the day I
show up to work drunk,

24:39.854 --> 24:41.479
I'm telling you,
Connie, and I mean this,
Mmm-hmm.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.983
You can fire me.
All right. I will.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.571
Cheers.
Cheers.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.004
No, no, no.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.302
Oh, my...

25:18.934 --> 25:19.934
My...

25:25.107 --> 25:26.274
Wait.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.382
Give it back! The little
white-gold ring that was
in that wooden box.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.509
It's my grandmother's.
Give it back!

26:03.145 --> 26:04.229
Go!
Ahh!

26:04.521 --> 26:05.521
Leave!

26:15.658 --> 26:18.660
Hey, Mouch, did you get
those parking tickets
taken care of?

26:19.328 --> 26:22.956
You know it. My girl
Trudy, she takes
good care of me.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.667
Awesome. 'Cause we
got three more.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.257
I'll handle it.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.010
Hey, Ruzek.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.763
Matt, hey, you got a
second? We should talk
in private.

26:39.223 --> 26:40.223
Yeah.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.601
Well, your instincts
were spot on.

26:44.436 --> 26:48.856
Uh, this cat Jim and his
receptionist are definitely
hanging out.

26:50.359 --> 26:53.236
It gets worse, man.
You said that he and
Christie are broke?

26:53.404 --> 26:54.445
Yeah.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.490
Yeah, no, by the looks
if it, his company is
doing just fine.

26:58.534 --> 27:01.577
Uh, for the last year at
least, he's been playing
a sort of shell game

27:01.870 --> 27:03.830
to keep his assets out
of your sister's reach.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.127
He can't get away with
this, right?

27:09.878 --> 27:11.212
He can.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.132
He relinquished
control of the company
to a third party.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.718
Keri Hathaway.
Do you know who that is?

27:18.095 --> 27:19.220
The receptionist.
Mmm-hmm.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.265
So, bottom line is,

27:22.349 --> 27:24.934
if your sister signs off
on any sort of
mediation agreement,

27:25.060 --> 27:26.644
this jackass will get
all of the assets

27:26.729 --> 27:28.563
and there's not a damn
thing anybody can do
about it.

27:30.524 --> 27:31.858
All right.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.903
Sorry, man.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.782
Listen, if you need
anything else, I got
your back, all right?

27:39.867 --> 27:41.367
Let me know.
Okay.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.502
Sylvie.
Hey.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.504
I'm sorry I couldn't
get here sooner.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.256
Oh, it's okay, I'm okay.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.718
Really? You sounded pretty
upset on the phone.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.262
I was, but, you know I...

28:01.388 --> 28:03.097
Well, I'm taking care of
everything. I've already
reserved the U-Haul

28:03.182 --> 28:05.475
and I can start
packing your things
up right away.

28:06.435 --> 28:07.935
Uh...

28:14.693 --> 28:17.320
Harrison, I, I haven't
decided to leave.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.491
Someone broke into your
apartment, they almost
attacked you.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.284
You can't stay here.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.245
You, you can't
handle this kind of life.

28:28.123 --> 28:33.086
But I did. I did handle it.
I mean, I actually picked
up a baseball bat

28:33.170 --> 28:35.630
and yelled at the guy,
and he freaked out.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.299
That's nuts.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.095
Yeah, I, I guess
it kind of was.

28:44.723 --> 28:45.723
It's funny.

28:50.312 --> 28:53.106
I came to Chicago to
escape what happened
with you and me.

28:54.149 --> 28:57.402
But now I think this
is the right place for me.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.824
But that, that doesn't
mean that we have to
stop being together.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.244
Sylvie...

29:06.703 --> 29:10.498
I hate to say this, but I
don't think you're dealing

29:10.582 --> 29:12.166
with the reality
of all of this.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.421
I mean, sooner or later,
this is going to be

29:16.672 --> 29:20.883
another one of those things
that you just give up on.

29:22.094 --> 29:25.721
But this time, you
could really get hurt.
Everyone sees it.

29:25.848 --> 29:26.889
We're all worried about you.

29:29.768 --> 29:30.768
There it is.

29:32.521 --> 29:33.855
There what is?

29:34.106 --> 29:35.106
That feeling.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.609
I haven't felt it since I left
Fowlerton. Since you left me.

29:38.735 --> 29:41.737
I almost forgot
about it. That pit
in my stomach

29:41.864 --> 29:44.449
that I get when
you, you try
and cut me down

29:44.533 --> 29:46.325
and make me feel
like I'm crazy.

29:48.370 --> 29:49.579
Sylvie...
I think you should go.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.788
Come on, Sylvie.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.295
Truck 81,
Squad Three, Ambulance 61,
elevator accident...

29:57.379 --> 30:02.341
Sylvie, you walk out that
door, and I'm not gonna be
here when you get back.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.075
Excuse me. Thank you.

30:28.911 --> 30:31.078
Coming though. Coming through.

30:31.622 --> 30:34.707
I've never seen anything
like it. Something went
wrong with the system

30:34.833 --> 30:37.126
and sent the elevator
flying to the top of
the building.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.294
How many people inside?

30:38.378 --> 30:40.087
I don't know,
maybe five or six.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.215
Okay, we're staging
at the top.

30:49.932 --> 30:50.932
Go.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.101
Go. Go.

30:55.312 --> 30:56.604
Help! Help us!

30:56.855 --> 30:59.774
This is Lieutenant Severide
with the Chicago
Fire Department.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.859
Just hang tight, we're
gonna get you guys out.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.444
Otis, you're up.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.967
Get us out
of here! Hurry!

31:26.426 --> 31:27.426
It's not moving, Lieutenant.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.513
Damn it. It's jammed shut.
See if you can pry
it open just a little more.

31:31.974 --> 31:33.307
Nah, it's not gonna go.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.600
Please, get us out!

31:34.851 --> 31:36.936
Hey, guys, hang in there,
we're coming.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.648
I think we can squeeze
someone through,
maybe Dawson or Herrmann,

31:40.941 --> 31:43.067
have them go down,
try to force the doors
from the inside.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.527
All right.

31:44.611 --> 31:45.653
I got this, Lieutenant.

31:55.372 --> 31:56.539
Easy.

31:57.833 --> 31:58.833
You got it?
Yeah.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.340
Ahh!
Herrmann!

32:11.513 --> 32:13.180
It looks like they're two
stories down.

32:13.390 --> 32:14.390
Move! Now!

32:18.478 --> 32:21.188
Herrmann!
You all right in there?

32:21.523 --> 32:26.235
We're okay.
But, uh, we've got a lady
in here with what looks like

32:26.320 --> 32:28.446
a serious spinal cord injury.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.907
We better have a backboard
and a collar standing by.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.784
Copy that. You work on
the inner doors.

32:33.869 --> 32:34.994
Copy.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.289
There's no keyhole.
This is an older elevator.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.541
They only have
drop keyholes on
the top and bottom floors.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.585
Well, forcing these outer
doors is gonna take time.

32:42.669 --> 32:43.669
Which we don't have.

32:45.714 --> 32:50.468
Capp, go to the squad,
grab a drill. Uh, anybody
have a piece of paper?

32:50.552 --> 32:51.927
Anything?
Here!

33:18.413 --> 33:23.084
All right, Capp, on
that dot right there,
straight through.

33:27.881 --> 33:28.881
Otis, try it.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.433
Yeah.
Nice to see you guys.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.394
All right, come on.
Come on.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.230
Stay put, don't move.

33:44.439 --> 33:47.733
Brett, Mills, you stabilize
her, you get her out of
there as soon as possible.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.819
I hope this isn't
going anywhere.

33:49.903 --> 33:50.903
Only one way to
find out, right?

33:51.029 --> 33:52.279
Right.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.989
Don't worry, ma'am.
We're gonna get you
out of here.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.120
You're doing good.

34:01.081 --> 34:02.373
Okay, on three.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.333
One, two, three.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.586
We're fine. We're fine. Go.

34:18.390 --> 34:24.270
Gentlemen, for the second time
now, I'm going to ask about
the status of Molly's truck.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.147
There won't be a third time.

34:26.314 --> 34:29.233
The thing is, Chief,
we can't get it started.

34:29.443 --> 34:31.026
And if we can't start it...

34:31.236 --> 34:34.155
Mouch, is that an excuse
that I'm hearing?

34:35.157 --> 34:36.157
We'll get it running, Chief.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.868
Chief, you have a phone call.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.411
How are we gonna do that?

34:40.495 --> 34:44.582
Uh, well, I think we
have to go with the
nuclear option.

34:45.751 --> 34:46.751
Which is?

34:46.835 --> 34:47.835
Hey, Capp.

34:48.712 --> 34:49.712
Yeah?

34:49.838 --> 34:52.631
Will you repair the food
truck if 81 takes over
Squad's bathroom duty for

34:52.716 --> 34:53.758
the rest of the year?

34:53.842 --> 34:55.718
Mouch!
Hey, Mouch!

34:55.969 --> 34:56.969
Deal!

34:58.346 --> 35:03.142
Hey, Joe. Got some good
news for you. You are
back on the wheel.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.393
Say what?

35:04.478 --> 35:08.731
Your driving suspension
has been withdrawn.
Congratulations.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.693
You go to church or
something recently?

35:13.278 --> 35:14.945
Sometimes you gotta
believe, brother!

35:16.865 --> 35:17.865
Hey, Otis!

35:18.825 --> 35:20.868
Coach Boden called
me into his office!

35:20.952 --> 35:22.745
You guys ready
for the ride of your lives?

35:24.372 --> 35:28.042
Hey, Joe, man,
what are you doing?

35:30.545 --> 35:32.087
So sorry, Otis.

35:33.423 --> 35:38.469
Nephews, meet Joe Cruz.
Joe loves to pretend he
drives the truck.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.680
Okay!
Na zdorovie!

35:42.057 --> 35:44.183
All right, get in there.

36:04.538 --> 36:07.164
Really? You're really
not going to say anything?

36:07.415 --> 36:09.333
Why do you keep letting
me get away with that?

36:10.043 --> 36:14.004
You mean you were
doing it on purpose?

36:14.506 --> 36:17.299
For days now, yeah.
And you haven't
said a word.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.760
This was my worst
fear, Herrmann,

36:19.845 --> 36:21.971
that you guys weren't gonna
treat me like any other
candidate.

36:22.264 --> 36:25.683
Dawson, if you wanted
to be treated like any
other candidate,

36:25.934 --> 36:29.478
you would've cooled your
heels and waited for a spot
to open at another house.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.729
Now we're gonna do this?

36:30.814 --> 36:34.441
Yeah, we are. 'Cause you
insisted on working
under Casey.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.110
And now here we are.

36:38.738 --> 36:43.033
I want you to succeed,
Dawson. I wanna see that,
I really do.

36:43.994 --> 36:47.413
But you got to
admit that the dynamics
of this situation are...

36:49.958 --> 36:51.333
Challenging.

36:53.128 --> 36:57.172
Okay, so take me off
of Casey's hands, and let
me shadow you on calls.

36:58.091 --> 36:59.258
You want to be on my hip?

36:59.593 --> 37:01.927
Yeah. I think, I think I
could learn a lot from you.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.893
Okay.
Okay.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.938
You can start by closing
your compartment doors.

37:14.274 --> 37:15.608
Copy that.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.869
And this has been going
on for a year?

37:27.495 --> 37:29.872
At least. Maybe longer.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.627
I thought we could
work it out.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
I know.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.463
He allowed me
to believe that.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.133
You don't have to go
through this alone, Christie.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.509
I'll be right by your side.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.761
We're going to
get you a good lawyer...

37:43.845 --> 37:47.431
Uh, no, I'm, I'm
tired of fighting.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.683
I just wanna settle this
and be done with it.

37:50.435 --> 37:53.145
Christie, you can't let him
get away with this.

37:53.229 --> 37:56.315
Matt, it's my life,
and I just want to
get on with it.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.032
Mom?

38:07.410 --> 38:08.494
Hey.

38:13.041 --> 38:16.710
Listen, I've been where
you are, Violet.

38:17.545 --> 38:21.632
It's gonna be okay.
I promise you that.

38:24.719 --> 38:25.719
Come here.

38:32.769 --> 38:33.769
You sure you're okay?

38:34.396 --> 38:35.646
I'm fine.

38:38.191 --> 38:40.067
Don't beat yourself up.

38:40.193 --> 38:42.361
You can't fight this battle
for her, you know?

38:48.827 --> 38:49.910
Hey.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.036
Hey, Chief.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.747
Don't look so damn surprised.
I have been in a
bar before, Lieutenant.

38:53.873 --> 38:56.625
I know. I just don't
see you here much.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.587
Donna wanted some time
to herself. She's been
a little...

39:02.507 --> 39:04.216
Unpredictable lately.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.263
Hey, Chief, can I ask
you a question?

39:09.347 --> 39:11.640
What did it cost you to
get Cruz off suspension?

39:12.809 --> 39:16.270
I won't be included in
the next round of promotions,
that much I know.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.442
But we've got to stand
up for our people.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.694
Even if it's a tough fight.

39:29.743 --> 39:31.326
All right, boys.
Chop-chop.

39:31.536 --> 39:32.703
Oh-ho!

39:32.787 --> 39:35.706
Hey, you know, you know
what we need? All of us?

39:36.583 --> 39:37.916
A Vegas weekend.

39:39.794 --> 39:40.961
What weekend?

39:41.421 --> 39:43.630
Next weekend! Come on!

39:45.467 --> 39:47.760
I don't know. You need
a little more lead time

39:47.886 --> 39:49.762
or you get crushed
on the airfare.

39:49.846 --> 39:50.846
Oh!

39:51.181 --> 39:53.724
Never mind. Come on,
all right, this is
Squad trip only.

39:53.975 --> 39:56.101
We're going to Vegas!
That's an order!

39:56.352 --> 39:58.228
Yeah. Good, good.
Yeah. Sure.

39:59.898 --> 40:00.898
Hey, look who it is.

40:01.357 --> 40:02.399
Hey!
What's happening, Sylvie?

40:02.484 --> 40:03.484
Hey, guys.

40:04.194 --> 40:05.360
How you doing? You okay?

40:06.362 --> 40:08.113
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.200
That's good. Cheers.
Grab a seat.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.534
You wanna get
down on this?

40:12.702 --> 40:14.453
Come on, girl. I'm gonna
show you how to play.

40:27.634 --> 40:29.093
I'm gonna make a
firefighter out of you.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.681
That's exactly what I want.

40:51.616 --> 40:52.866
Shut up and listen, Jim.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.913
I'm gonna come to your
office at 8:00 a.m. sharp,

40:57.997 --> 41:00.666
and we're gonna take a long,
hard look at your books.

41:01.918 --> 41:08.006
So, Keri, why don't you
have those ready, huh?

41:09.300 --> 41:10.717
I don't know what
Christie told you...

41:10.802 --> 41:14.263
One more word and I'll
knock you flat on your ass.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.064
8:00 a.m.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.317
Don't make
me come find you.
