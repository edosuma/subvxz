00:01.020 --> 00:02.380
NARRATOR:
Tonight on The Curse

00:02.380 --> 00:03.679
of Oak Island...

00:03.679 --> 00:04.899
We have a dozen survey plans.

00:04.899 --> 00:06.609
RICK:
We now have an ability

00:06.609 --> 00:07.899
to overlay the surveys.

00:07.899 --> 00:09.949
STEVE G.:
Shaft Six is right here.

00:09.949 --> 00:11.690
Put your finger on the map,
big brother.

00:11.690 --> 00:13.530
We focused in
on the most likely spot

00:13.530 --> 00:15.779
in the Money Pit to find
some actual treasure.

00:15.779 --> 00:17.450
I think it’s there.
I really do.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.010
-Ooh! It’s a coin.
-No way.

00:19.010 --> 00:20.050
This could be depositor.

00:20.050 --> 00:21.870
VANESSA: Those are
some really big timbers.

00:21.870 --> 00:23.690
-Yeah, there we go.
-MARTY: They’re oak,

00:23.690 --> 00:26.470
which would be the only oak
we’ve ever seen underground.

00:26.470 --> 00:28.330
PAUL:
We must be near the Money Pit.

00:28.330 --> 00:30.490
That changes everything.

00:30.490 --> 00:33.120
NARRATOR:
There is an island

00:33.120 --> 00:34.680
in the North Atlantic

00:34.680 --> 00:38.130
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.130 --> 00:40.830
for more than 200 years.

00:40.830 --> 00:45.140
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:45.140 --> 00:47.829
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:47.829 --> 00:50.100
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.100 --> 00:54.430
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.430 --> 00:56.710
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.710 --> 01:02.649
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:02.649 --> 01:05.810
And, according to legend,

01:05.810 --> 01:08.139
one more will have to die

01:08.139 --> 01:11.634
before the treasure
can be found.

01:35.634 --> 01:38.200
NARRATOR: At the start
of another day on Oak Island...

01:38.200 --> 01:39.680
-Hello.
-GARY: Hey, Rick.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.719
...Rick Lagina meets
with Jack Begley,

01:41.719 --> 01:44.599
metal detection expert
Gary Drayton,

01:44.599 --> 01:46.659
and archaeologist Laird Niven

01:46.659 --> 01:48.100
at Smith’s Cove.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.979
We can excavate this material.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.929
NARRATOR: They are eager
to continue their investigation

01:52.929 --> 01:55.529
of one of the most
intriguing structures

01:55.529 --> 01:57.600
uncovered on the island so far.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.789
The remains of what could be

02:00.789 --> 02:02.320
a centuries-old slipway.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.509
A ramp
that would have been used

02:05.509 --> 02:08.098
to load goods
both to and from the island

02:08.098 --> 02:09.810
from a large sailing ship.

02:09.810 --> 02:12.550
We have to stay focused
down here,

02:12.550 --> 02:13.780
so... I think,

02:13.780 --> 02:16.820
obviously, there’s a couple
things we need to do.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.220
Uh, address proper removal

02:18.220 --> 02:20.140
of this piece that remains.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.200
-Okay.
-Right?

02:21.200 --> 02:24.330
-You’re okay with that?
-Sure.

02:24.330 --> 02:27.570
NARRATOR: Since discovering
the slipway five weeks ago...

02:27.570 --> 02:28.950
GARY:
That’s a beauty.

02:28.950 --> 02:32.790
...the Oak Island team has made
a number of additional

02:32.790 --> 02:36.440
and equally intriguing
discoveries in the area,

02:36.440 --> 02:39.260
including iron cribbing spikes

02:39.260 --> 02:42.090
and a mysterious metal hinge,

02:42.090 --> 02:43.910
estimated to date back

02:43.910 --> 02:46.490
more than 100 years
before the discovery

02:46.490 --> 02:51.970
of the Oak Island Money Pit
in 1795.

02:51.970 --> 02:54.110
Wow.

02:54.110 --> 02:58.080
NARRATOR:
It is now the team’s plan

02:58.080 --> 02:59.480
to document, dismantle,

02:59.480 --> 03:02.040
and then carefully remove
the slipway

03:02.040 --> 03:04.840
in an effort to find
even more artifacts

03:04.840 --> 03:06.600
or important clues

03:06.600 --> 03:08.630
that might help them
determine the identities

03:08.630 --> 03:10.700
of the people who built it

03:10.700 --> 03:14.210
and, hopefully, what they might
have brought to the island

03:14.210 --> 03:16.010
centuries ago.

03:16.010 --> 03:19.350
We have
an enormous amount of work

03:19.350 --> 03:22.610
that we’ve uncovered
in Smith’s Cove.

03:22.610 --> 03:24.890
The slipway,
U-shaped structure,

03:24.890 --> 03:27.170
vertical wall,
L-shaped structure.

03:27.170 --> 03:30.440
But I don’t think we have
all the answers yet

03:30.440 --> 03:32.150
at Smith’s Cove,
I really don’t.

03:32.150 --> 03:35.410
We could be a few feet away
from a real answer.

03:35.410 --> 03:38.050
Or a much more substantial
answer in Smith’s Cove,

03:38.050 --> 03:39.610
so the game’s still afoot.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.960
Billy, you’re gonna get
as much material

03:42.060 --> 03:44.360
as quickly as possible
up to the wash plant.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.020
Jack, you and Gary are gonna

03:46.220 --> 03:49.060
-find something good today.
-Go find some good stuff.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.760
And then, um, looking outward,

03:52.160 --> 03:54.580
we’ll, uh, take the CAT
and bulldoze this flat.

03:54.580 --> 03:56.490
We’ll have Mike West come in,
run the EM61.

03:56.490 --> 03:59.330
If we find deeper targets,
that’d be fantastic.

03:59.330 --> 04:01.240
You know, your cannons and...

04:01.240 --> 04:03.860
-and ships’ anchors.
-JACK: Right.

04:03.860 --> 04:05.360
And Jack and I
will hopefully have

04:05.360 --> 04:07.350
some good news for you today.

04:07.350 --> 04:08.360
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.870
-Okay?
-JACK: Okay.

04:09.870 --> 04:11.880
-All right.
-(overlapping chatter)

04:11.880 --> 04:14.290
NARRATOR:
As archaeologist Laird Niven

04:14.290 --> 04:17.988
begins dismantling the slipway
at Smith’s Cove,

04:17.988 --> 04:19.789
Rick, Gary and Jack

04:19.789 --> 04:23.070
join Rick’s brother Marty
and other members of the team

04:23.070 --> 04:26.129
in the war room, where
they have arranged a meeting

04:26.129 --> 04:28.979
with professional surveyor
Steve Guptill.

04:28.979 --> 04:30.719
RICK:
Steve is back.

04:30.719 --> 04:32.830
Has all the data inputted.

04:32.830 --> 04:35.080
We need to really come up with

04:35.080 --> 04:37.460
a proper location for where

04:37.460 --> 04:39.639
Shaft Six is,
where Tunnel Six is,

04:39.639 --> 04:41.439
and where we might locate
the can.

04:41.439 --> 04:43.900
So, to that end,
I would turn it over

04:43.900 --> 04:45.250
to Steve.
Sure.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.060
So, here is just...

04:47.060 --> 04:50.240
a quick overview...

04:50.240 --> 04:52.139
of everything
that has been drilled up there.

04:52.139 --> 04:54.340
DAVE (laughs):
That looks like spaghetti.

04:54.340 --> 04:55.340
(laughter)

04:55.340 --> 04:58.240
STEVE:
So... I took that data

04:58.240 --> 04:59.300
and I combined it

04:59.300 --> 05:01.139
on some survey plans.

05:01.139 --> 05:03.840
We have about a dozen plans
that we’ve used.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.729
NARRATOR:
Three weeks ago,

05:05.729 --> 05:08.930
while excavating the shaft
known as Borehole H8...

05:08.930 --> 05:09.930
It’s caving.

05:09.930 --> 05:12.370
...the ground
beneath the massive

05:12.370 --> 05:14.400
25ton rotating oscillator

05:14.400 --> 05:15.400
began to give way.
Oh, baby.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
CHARLES:
Be careful.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.039
(all shouting)

05:18.039 --> 05:21.199
NARRATOR:
The event forced the team

05:21.199 --> 05:23.020
to find another way to reach

05:23.020 --> 05:24.900
the original Money Pit
treasure shaft

05:24.900 --> 05:27.400
by means
of an old searcher tunnel

05:27.400 --> 05:29.540
known as Shaft Six.

05:29.540 --> 05:32.960
But since Shaft Six
was first dug in 1861,

05:32.960 --> 05:36.629
its exact location
has remained elusive.

05:36.629 --> 05:40.659
For this reason,
Steve Guptill has been hired

05:40.659 --> 05:44.889
to combine literally dozens
of searcher records and data

05:44.889 --> 05:46.371
into one master map,

05:46.371 --> 05:48.930
one that Rick Lagina hopes
will allow the team

05:48.930 --> 05:52.520
to locate Shaft Six
and hopefully the Money Pit,

05:52.520 --> 05:54.259
once and for all.

05:54.259 --> 05:57.330
So, here’s an example.

05:57.330 --> 05:59.639
RV Harris, 1958...

05:59.639 --> 06:01.620
has estimated that Shaft Six
is right there.

06:01.620 --> 06:02.729
MARTY:
Okay.

06:02.729 --> 06:08.630
So, let’s now turn on
Fred Nolan.

06:08.630 --> 06:09.630
So here’s Fred Nolan.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.340
Where does he think
Shaft Six is in that plan?

06:12.340 --> 06:14.279
So, I believe it would be

06:14.279 --> 06:15.279
Can you see that?

06:15.279 --> 06:18.490
I believe that’s where
he thinks Shaft Six is.

06:18.490 --> 06:21.750
So I’m gonna go through
a couple more.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.949
You’re gonna see a general
consensus of all these plans

06:24.949 --> 06:27.310
that Shaft Six is very much
in that location.

06:27.310 --> 06:29.210
The red dots are
our efforts, right?

06:29.210 --> 06:31.379
The red dots are ours, yes.

06:31.379 --> 06:32.990
Okay, so...

06:32.990 --> 06:35.210
of the overall grid,

06:35.210 --> 06:42.320
Shaft Six lands right here.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.510
The green’s the tunnel.

06:43.510 --> 06:44.650
Shaft Six is green.

06:44.650 --> 06:47.190
So it cuts IJ5.5, K5.5...

06:47.190 --> 06:50.229
IJ5.5 is where it is because

06:50.229 --> 06:53.280
we cut that horizontal,
vertical wood.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.039
Yeah, what I found really
interesting about this is

06:56.039 --> 06:59.909
that earlier in the year
when we used the Geotech grid

06:59.909 --> 07:02.849
and we got the idea
that Shaft Six was here.

07:02.849 --> 07:04.300
So we drilled
and what do we find?

07:04.300 --> 07:05.300
Tunnel.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.300
Yeah, a tunnel.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.040
We’ve identified a tunnel
running where

07:08.040 --> 07:11.659
we thought
there should be a tunnel.

07:11.659 --> 07:13.909
IJ5.5 and K5.5,
that came in

07:13.909 --> 07:16.809
almost perfectly.
How about that?

07:16.809 --> 07:19.909
But, Rick, if you’re right,

07:19.909 --> 07:22.139
you expect to find a piece

07:22.139 --> 07:24.210
or pieces of treasure
in this shaft?

07:24.210 --> 07:25.210
Yeah.

07:25.210 --> 07:26.210
Yes, you’re quite
convinced of that?

07:26.210 --> 07:27.210
Yes.

07:27.210 --> 07:29.839
NARRATOR:
Because both the Money Pit

07:29.839 --> 07:32.639
and Shaft Six collapsed
in 1861,

07:32.639 --> 07:34.900
the Oak Island team
is targeting

07:34.900 --> 07:38.039
not only Shaft Six,
but also what they believe

07:38.039 --> 07:40.199
could be a debris field.

07:40.199 --> 07:43.009
One that should be full
of valuable artifacts

07:43.009 --> 07:46.110
and perhaps treasure.

07:46.110 --> 07:48.169
I think we’re closer than ever

07:48.169 --> 07:51.889
to possibly finding
the one thing.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.569
Slowly but surely,

07:53.569 --> 07:55.710
we’re unraveling the Money Pit.

07:55.710 --> 07:57.949
MARTY:
I think...

07:57.949 --> 08:00.029
Rick should have the honor
of putting his finger

08:00.029 --> 08:02.020
on the map,
which’ll become the place

08:02.020 --> 08:03.080
that we’re gonna
put down a caisson,

08:03.080 --> 08:05.009
so put your finger
on the map, big brother.

08:05.009 --> 08:07.379
I would, I would rather
we all put our fingers on.

08:07.379 --> 08:09.569
Put your finger
on the map, come on.

08:09.569 --> 08:11.020
Where’s the spot?

08:11.020 --> 08:12.960
Right there.
Right there.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.379
MARTY: Pin that. Perfect.
Yes.

08:15.379 --> 08:16.840
MARTY:
Okay. Let’s do it.

08:16.840 --> 08:17.840
Excellent work, you guys.
Excellent work.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.289
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon,

08:20.289 --> 08:25.369
Jack Begley
and metal detection expert

08:25.369 --> 08:28.710
Gary Drayton
return to Smith’s Cove,

08:28.710 --> 08:31.370
where archaeologist Laird Niven
is continuing

08:31.370 --> 08:33.659
to carefully remove sections

08:33.659 --> 08:37.820
of the potentially
ancient slipway.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.530
I see you’ve taken
some logs off.

08:39.530 --> 08:40.559
LAIRD:
I did.

08:40.559 --> 08:41.630
Thought you guys
should come down

08:41.630 --> 08:43.750
and take a look.
Yep.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.991
JACK: Mmhmm.
GARY: Are you going to go

08:45.991 --> 08:47.000
all the way down to the end?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.450
Well, I’ve taken some logs here.

08:48.450 --> 08:51.180
I’ll continue to take them
down below...

08:51.180 --> 08:53.240
So, can I metal detect in here?

08:53.240 --> 08:55.880
LAIRD: Yeah, sure.
Now you’ve taken the logs off?

08:55.880 --> 08:58.600
LAIRD: Yeah.
That will make it easier.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.940
All right.
Sounds good to me.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.880
GARY:
I’ve been talking to Laird.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.900
We’re both in agreement
that this is probably

09:05.900 --> 09:09.530
the oldest structure
in Smith’s Cove.

09:09.530 --> 09:12.470
The further we follow
this slipway up,

09:12.470 --> 09:14.660
the more chances we’ve got

09:14.660 --> 09:17.060
at finding old artifacts

09:17.060 --> 09:19.740
trapped underneath the slipway.

09:19.740 --> 09:21.750
That’s where
the old stuff’s gonna be.

09:21.750 --> 09:25.070
All right, well,
let’s move these guys that way.

09:25.070 --> 09:26.180
(detector beeps, whines)

09:26.180 --> 09:28.450
I hear that.
Yep.

09:28.450 --> 09:29.450
Ready when you are, Jack.

09:29.450 --> 09:30.630
(detector beeping rapidly)
Here, do it with the...

09:30.630 --> 09:33.380
With the trowel?
GARY: The trowel?

09:33.380 --> 09:34.380
JACK:
All right.

09:34.380 --> 09:35.380
(detector whining)

09:35.380 --> 09:41.360
Sounds like that may be
in the wood, too.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.940
Yeah, it could possibly
be in the wood.

09:44.940 --> 09:48.950
That looks like iron residue.

09:48.950 --> 09:51.300
JACK:
Yes, it does.

09:51.300 --> 09:58.540
Pinpoint it and then we can
dig around it.

09:58.540 --> 10:03.693
Okay, let me see
if I can pinpoint it.

10:03.693 --> 10:04.693
(beeping)

10:04.693 --> 10:05.693
(beeping stops)
GARY: No, that’s not it.

10:05.693 --> 10:06.693
JACK:
What?

10:06.693 --> 10:07.693
No, it’s still in there.
It’s deeper.

10:07.693 --> 10:08.693
I will get my shovel, then.

10:08.693 --> 10:09.693
(detector beeping, whining)

10:09.693 --> 10:10.693
(sustained whine)

10:10.693 --> 10:11.693
GARY:
Should be in the center there.

10:11.693 --> 10:15.530
The fact that it’s deep
is a good sign.

10:15.530 --> 10:19.850
(detector beeps)
JACK: You think it’s out?

10:19.850 --> 10:22.930
(beeping)
GARY: Yeah, it’s out.

10:22.930 --> 10:23.930
(beeping)

10:23.930 --> 10:27.190
It’s probably not something
that big, then.

10:27.190 --> 10:28.190
(beeps)

10:28.190 --> 10:29.190
(rapid beeping)

10:29.190 --> 10:31.840
GARY:
Yeah, it’s this.

10:31.840 --> 10:32.840
(beeping)

10:32.840 --> 10:34.700
It’s in this clump.

10:34.700 --> 10:38.030
JACK: It’s iron pyrite.
GARY: Yeah, it’s iron.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.030
(beeps)

10:39.030 --> 10:42.210
I have no idea what it is,
it’s I wish it was heavier.

10:42.210 --> 10:43.210
LAIRD:
Yeah.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.240
Well, we’ll keep it
and record it.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.530
Yep.
JACK: Mmhmm.

10:46.530 --> 10:48.630
And clean that off,
see what it is.

10:48.630 --> 10:49.630
Yep.

10:49.630 --> 10:50.710
Well, it’s metal,
and it’s deep.

10:50.710 --> 10:51.710
It is.

10:51.710 --> 10:54.020
And I’m sure there’s gonna be
some better stuff even deeper.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.370
I’ll go grab a bag.

10:55.370 --> 10:58.820
You were right. As we started to
remove some of these timbers,

10:58.820 --> 11:02.860
there’s a lot more items
that are gonna be found.

11:02.860 --> 11:05.450
Laird, is this outside one
ready to take then, or...

11:05.450 --> 11:07.560
The outside one is, yeah.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.770
(engine starts)

11:08.770 --> 11:11.380
NARRATOR:
Now that the first section

11:11.380 --> 11:12.380
of the slipway

11:12.380 --> 11:13.650
has been cleared away,

11:13.650 --> 11:16.970
heavy equipment operator
Billy Gerhardt will remove

11:16.970 --> 11:20.220
the larger timbers running
along the side of the structure

11:20.220 --> 11:23.160
so that the team can begin
digging underneath it.

11:23.160 --> 11:27.090
Imagine the last people
who put that log in place.

11:27.090 --> 11:28.670
JACK:
I know. Right?

11:28.670 --> 11:30.830
NARRATOR:
The tons of earth excavated

11:30.830 --> 11:31.870
in this process

11:31.870 --> 11:34.870
will then be transported
to the nearby wash plant,

11:34.870 --> 11:36.900
where the materials
will be cleaned

11:36.900 --> 11:39.920
and automatically sorted
according to size.

11:39.920 --> 11:44.450
The resulting piles will then
be thoroughly searched by hand,

11:44.450 --> 11:49.000
as well as with
a metal detector.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.850
(detector whining)
GARY: Sounds good.

11:54.850 --> 11:59.950
JACK:
What do you think that is?

11:59.950 --> 12:01.810
GARY:
There’s a lot of little

12:01.810 --> 12:03.300
shards of iron in there,

12:03.300 --> 12:06.900
by the sound of it.

12:06.900 --> 12:07.900
(beeping)
Something small.

12:07.900 --> 12:08.900
All right, now I’m excited.
(laughs)

12:08.900 --> 12:09.900
GARY:
Where are you?

12:09.900 --> 12:22.760
What the hell is this?

12:22.760 --> 12:23.760
It is a coin.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.760
No way.
Look at that.

12:24.760 --> 12:29.480
That’s a silver coin.

12:29.480 --> 12:35.200
Wow, this is cool.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.240
nt
at Smith’s Cove

12:37.240 --> 12:41.230
as Jack Begley and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton

12:41.230 --> 12:44.650
have just found what he
believes to be a silver coin.

12:44.650 --> 12:47.430
This could be depositor,
a depositor coin.

12:47.430 --> 12:48.430
Mmhmm.

12:48.430 --> 12:49.430
What I like about this,

12:49.430 --> 12:52.230
it’s encrusted
and where it came from.

12:52.230 --> 12:55.430
These spoils came from
the side of the slipway.

12:55.430 --> 12:57.650
Yeah, for sure.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.450
GARY:
It looks like the size

12:59.450 --> 13:01.900
of a Spanish one real.

13:01.900 --> 13:02.900
Ooh.

13:02.900 --> 13:06.030
NARRATOR:
A Spanish silver real?

13:06.030 --> 13:08.090
First minted in the mid1300s

13:08.090 --> 13:12.000
by order of King Pedro I
of Spain,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.850
the silver real was
a predominant piece of currency

13:15.850 --> 13:18.560
among traders and explorers
in the Americas

13:18.560 --> 13:22.040
from the 15th
to the 19th centuries.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.550
These coins were also common
among Spanish

13:25.550 --> 13:26.660
and Portuguese pirates,

13:26.660 --> 13:28.480
who were known
to frequent the islands

13:28.480 --> 13:30.090
off the coast of Nova Scotia,

13:30.090 --> 13:33.380
dating back as early
as the 1500s.

13:33.380 --> 13:38.150
Could this Spanish silver coin
be evidence that could help

13:38.150 --> 13:40.180
in dating the recently
unearthed slipway,

13:40.180 --> 13:44.240
and the identities of those
who might have built it?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.690
Rick.

13:45.690 --> 13:50.460
You both look pretty
pleased with yourselves.

13:50.460 --> 13:51.880
Yeah. We got off
to a flying start.

13:51.880 --> 13:52.880
It’s silver.

13:52.880 --> 13:57.540
I don’t know how old it is,
but it could be old.

13:57.540 --> 14:02.030
It could be an early real.
A one real.

14:02.030 --> 14:04.590
I think it’s older
than more recent

14:04.590 --> 14:07.560
because I’m either seeing
some sort of Roman numerals

14:07.560 --> 14:09.600
or Latin on there.
It’s got a milled edge,

14:09.600 --> 14:10.600
doesn’t it?

14:10.600 --> 14:11.600
GARY: Yeah, it’s milled.
It can’t be any older

14:11.600 --> 14:12.600
than 1730.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.600
No, because it’s got
a milled edge.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.580
That means it was made
by machine.

14:17.580 --> 14:24.220
But, hey, I’d take a nice
1730s or ’40s one real.

14:24.220 --> 14:26.900
Yeah. Silver and gold
is fantastic, right?

14:26.900 --> 14:28.790
It’s, you know, "treasure."

14:28.790 --> 14:31.150
But, an early date,
presearcher,

14:31.150 --> 14:33.420
I’d be just as happy.

14:33.420 --> 14:35.990
I’d settle for copper
over silver, but...

14:35.990 --> 14:39.650
I know, you and I
want to see him dance.

14:39.650 --> 14:40.650
(laughter)

14:40.650 --> 14:42.860
Yeah, you need me bringing stuff
out of my top pocket.

14:42.860 --> 14:45.360
See you later, mate.
See ya.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.881
JARDINE:
Okay, to the center of the pins.

14:56.881 --> 14:58.281
I’m good.
I’m good.

14:58.381 --> 14:59.681
NARRATOR:
It is the start of

14:59.781 --> 15:01.481
another day on Oak Island.

15:02.381 --> 15:04.300
Okay, hold it right there.
What do you got?

15:04.300 --> 15:07.870
I got 20 feet.
I’m 20 feet to the center

15:07.870 --> 15:09.470
of the pin.

15:09.470 --> 15:10.470
JARDINE:
Okay, good.

15:10.470 --> 15:11.470
NARRATOR:
And in spite of the harsh

15:11.470 --> 15:12.470
fall weather,

15:12.470 --> 15:14.190
Rick Lagina and members
of the team

15:14.190 --> 15:15.940
are more determined than ever

15:15.940 --> 15:18.130
to locate the original
Money Pit.

15:18.130 --> 15:20.350
We’ll confirm
the data’s correct,

15:20.350 --> 15:23.530
and then we’re off to the races.

15:23.530 --> 15:24.530
NARRATOR:
The site, dubbed "S6," has

15:24.530 --> 15:26.170
been named after Shaft Six,

15:26.170 --> 15:29.060
the 19th century
searcher tunnel, which,

15:29.060 --> 15:30.740
if they can reach it,

15:30.740 --> 15:35.540
should lead directly to
the original treasure vault.

15:35.540 --> 15:39.990
This is what we’re
looking at, folks.

15:39.990 --> 15:42.110
If we’re right about this
being the Money Pit,

15:42.110 --> 15:44.510
we’d expect a tunnel to come in
from this direction,

15:44.510 --> 15:46.170
this direction and this way.

15:46.170 --> 15:47.610
Historically, right?
Right.

15:47.610 --> 15:50.020
So that’s good news.
This should intersect,

15:50.020 --> 15:54.070
either this way, or going
this way, which is good.

15:54.070 --> 15:58.540
It’s a significant area
of interest, and I hope that

15:58.540 --> 16:00.230
that can right there
will provide us

16:00.230 --> 16:01.450
with answers, finally.

16:01.450 --> 16:03.940
The tunnel’s our target,
then let’s

16:03.940 --> 16:05.060
set right up on top of it.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.710
I love everybody’s enthusiasm.

16:06.710 --> 16:08.910
I love the fact that
we all concur.

16:08.910 --> 16:11.810
Let’s get after it
and get it done.

16:11.810 --> 16:12.810
Okay.

16:12.810 --> 16:15.530
NARRATOR:
Using a massive 220ton crane,

16:15.530 --> 16:19.300
the team from Irving Equipment
Limited will now move

16:19.300 --> 16:23.370
a 35ton "bridge" into position
over the S6 dig site.

16:23.370 --> 16:26.300
Move it down just
a little bit, and that’s it.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.300
Watch your toes.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.190
NARRATOR:
Once in place, it will serve as

16:29.190 --> 16:30.760
a stabilizing platform

16:30.760 --> 16:35.050
for the rotating oscillator,
which will drive a 60inchwide

16:35.050 --> 16:37.450
steel caisson down
to its target depth

16:37.450 --> 16:40.850
of approximately
118 feet deep underground.

16:40.850 --> 16:45.190
We’re about to begin on
probably the most important

16:45.190 --> 16:47.240
excavation on Oak Island
this year.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.860
RICK:
To me, the archival record

16:49.860 --> 16:52.680
of the Shaft Six, the tunnel,

16:52.680 --> 16:54.530
the idea of coming across,

16:54.530 --> 16:57.800
coming up underneath
the Money Pit, the collapse,

16:57.800 --> 17:02.070
the men run for their lives
all of that, to me, reads real.

17:02.070 --> 17:03.960
We think we’ve focused in on
the most likely spot

17:03.960 --> 17:07.359
in the Money Pit to find
some actual treasure.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.790
JOHN LEE:
I’m good over here.

17:09.790 --> 17:12.540
DANNY: We’re in.
JOHN LEE: We’re good.

17:12.540 --> 17:15.220
Right about here is where
you need the champagne bottle.

17:15.220 --> 17:16.520
(laughing)

17:19.920 --> 17:22.119
RICK:
I think it’s there. I really do.

17:24.420 --> 17:25.920
NARRATOR:
As the excavation of S6

17:26.020 --> 17:27.520
begins at the Money Pit site,

17:28.720 --> 17:32.860
later that afternoon, Rick
Lagina heads to Smith’s Cove,

17:32.860 --> 17:35.990
where he has arranged to meet
with geophysicist Mike West.

17:35.990 --> 17:36.990
Hey, Mike.
Hey, Rick.

17:36.990 --> 17:40.650
Good to see you again.
There’s Smith’s Cove,

17:40.650 --> 17:42.900
all prepped and ready for you.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.130
NARRATOR:
Now that the slipway and other

17:45.130 --> 17:46.970
structures have been removed,

17:46.970 --> 17:50.780
Rick is eager to conduct a deep
scan of the excavated area

17:50.780 --> 17:53.200
using powerful
metal detection equipment.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.180
Yeah, I mean, once I get going,

17:56.180 --> 17:58.670
if I get something, I’ll mark it
out with the flags,

17:58.670 --> 18:00.110
and then have something
to come back to.

18:00.110 --> 18:02.440
You go down there,
you’ll see the cove has changed

18:02.440 --> 18:04.120
since you were last there.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.120
Significantly changed, so...

18:05.120 --> 18:06.890
Good to know.
Get your gear up and running.

18:06.890 --> 18:08.580
I’m gonna just take
a quick little peek.

18:08.580 --> 18:10.330
Oh, yeah, come on down.

18:10.330 --> 18:12.420
Probably throw on
my rubber boots.

18:12.420 --> 18:14.990
It’s hard to believe,
as we look at it,

18:14.990 --> 18:18.280
how much material
we actually removed and washed.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.280
Yeah. Yeah.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.230
Things have changed, yeah.
You’re Wow.

18:22.230 --> 18:23.990
You’re down there.
Yeah.

18:23.990 --> 18:25.920
Given all of this work,

18:25.920 --> 18:27.520
concentrated in this one area...

18:27.520 --> 18:30.430
you know, what we’re standing on
right now, the crane pad,

18:30.430 --> 18:33.309
we’re probably standing on
the most interesting part

18:33.309 --> 18:35.830
of the hunt in Smith’s Cove
right here.

18:35.830 --> 18:39.360
NARRATOR:
Two weeks ago, Rick, Marty

18:39.360 --> 18:40.360
and the team...

18:40.360 --> 18:41.360
Here comes the water.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.360
NARRATOR:
...conducted a dye test

18:42.360 --> 18:45.130
to look for evidence
of a direct link

18:45.130 --> 18:48.600
between the Money Pit site
and Smith’s Cove.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.240
After pumping thousands
of gallons of water

18:51.240 --> 18:53.940
that was dyed red
down the C1 shaft,

18:53.940 --> 18:56.590
metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

18:56.590 --> 18:58.270
discovered traces of it...

18:58.270 --> 18:59.350
Oh, my God.

18:59.350 --> 19:00.860
NARRATOR:
...right in front of the

19:00.860 --> 19:02.210
wooden crane pad used

19:02.210 --> 19:04.740
to construct
the Smith’s Cove cofferdam.

19:04.740 --> 19:07.050
If we’re looking for red, guys,

19:07.050 --> 19:09.370
I’d say that’s
reddybrown there.

19:09.370 --> 19:11.470
JACK:
Oh, what?!

19:11.470 --> 19:13.520
NARRATOR:
Although the team has not yet

19:13.520 --> 19:15.250
obtained the necessary permits

19:15.250 --> 19:18.220
to allow them to begin
excavating beneath the pad,

19:18.220 --> 19:21.780
Rick is hoping today’s survey
will help identify

19:21.780 --> 19:24.960
potential dig sites
for their upcoming operation.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.840
You have the entirety of
Smith’s Cove at your disposal.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.710
So, if you want to get
geared up...

19:29.710 --> 19:31.830
Yeah, I’ll get geared up.

19:31.830 --> 19:34.000
NARRATOR:
Using a device known

19:34.000 --> 19:35.820
as an "EM61,"

19:35.820 --> 19:39.700
Mike will now scan the area
for any important clues,

19:39.700 --> 19:42.570
or possible structures
that may lie buried

19:42.570 --> 19:44.810
as much as
20 feet deep underground.

19:44.810 --> 19:48.320
(device chiming)

19:55.520 --> 19:57.070
WEST:
I’ve got a pretty high reading.

19:57.370 --> 20:00.070
It’s something.

20:00.270 --> 20:02.870
Search continues.

20:07.570 --> 20:11.070
(chiming continues)

20:16.070 --> 20:17.270
It’s right there.
Really?

20:18.070 --> 20:20.850
Very, very large.

20:20.850 --> 20:24.700
Oh, there you go.
All right!

20:24.700 --> 20:30.560
That’s as big as they get
for targets.

20:30.560 --> 20:35.630
I was hoping to see a sea
of pink flags.

20:35.630 --> 20:37.340
NARRATOR:
After searching for metal

20:37.340 --> 20:39.520
anomalies at Smith’s Cove,

20:39.520 --> 20:42.210
Mike West reviews his
preliminary findings

20:42.210 --> 20:43.550
with Rick Lagina.

20:43.550 --> 20:47.240
You only need one.
Only need one.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.820
We got five.

20:48.820 --> 20:51.030
Any of them stand out?

20:51.030 --> 20:52.830
That one over here,
towards the bank,

20:52.830 --> 20:53.920
is, like, 600 millivolt.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.290
Really?
Which is a hu

20:55.290 --> 20:56.960
it’s a huge target, yeah.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.300
RICK:
And it’s next to the crane pad.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.300
Yeah.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.760
NARRATOR:
A huge target,

21:03.760 --> 21:06.470
buried beneath
the wooden crane pad?

21:06.470 --> 21:09.610
Could it be evidence
of the flood tunnels

21:09.610 --> 21:12.220
that protect
the Money Pit treasure vault?

21:12.220 --> 21:13.980
Or something else,

21:13.980 --> 21:17.340
perhaps something
of even greater significance?

21:17.340 --> 21:19.130
RICK:
We got a signal,

21:19.130 --> 21:22.050
coming out from underneath
the crane pad,

21:22.050 --> 21:24.750
but what is it?

21:24.750 --> 21:27.380
We want to X out Smith’s Cove,
we want to get the data

21:27.380 --> 21:29.600
that’s in there, so we’re
probably gonna have to excavate

21:29.600 --> 21:31.480
the crane pad
and explore underneath it.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.750
RICK:
We’re coming near end of the day

21:33.750 --> 21:37.500
and you’ve gotten
all of this, right?

21:37.500 --> 21:38.690
Yes.

21:38.690 --> 21:40.720
Let’s call it a day. Good job.
Okay.

21:48.220 --> 21:50.320
NARRATOR
The next day...

21:50.320 --> 21:51.340
MARTY:
Morning, guys.

21:51.340 --> 21:52.700
Shiny gold things!
(chuckles)

21:52.700 --> 21:54.660
Shiny gold things!
NARRATOR: Rick, Marty

21:54.660 --> 21:55.970
and the Oak Island team

21:55.970 --> 21:58.070
arrive at the Money Pit site

21:58.070 --> 22:01.960
to review the day’s drilling
strategy with Vanessa Lucido

22:01.960 --> 22:03.840
from Roc Equipment.
Hey.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.950
NARRATOR:
They are hoping that

22:05.950 --> 22:06.950
by carefully digging

22:06.950 --> 22:10.450
in the vicinity of Shaft Six,
they will find the tunnel

22:10.450 --> 22:12.390
that was constructed
to intersect

22:12.390 --> 22:16.179
the original Money Pit, along
with a possible debris field,

22:16.179 --> 22:19.020
which, according to Rick’s
research, should be filled

22:19.020 --> 22:22.440
with artifacts and evidence
of the Oak Island treasure.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.150
What do we got?

22:25.250 --> 22:27.566
Uh, right now with the can,
we’re at 82 feet,

22:27.666 --> 22:29.510
and excavation inside, 78 feet.

22:29.510 --> 22:31.800
So we got time. That’s good.
Yeah.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.370
DOUG:
Yeah, it’s kind of

22:34.370 --> 22:35.910
interesting now, Marty,

22:35.910 --> 22:37.800
we’re getting
a lot of timbers coming up.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.800
Yeah, why is that exactly?

22:38.800 --> 22:40.510
Well they look
like Chappell Shaft timbers.

22:40.510 --> 22:42.970
They look to be six by six,
so we’re hoping

22:42.970 --> 22:45.210
it’s where it fell into
the Dunfield excavation.

22:45.210 --> 22:47.190
Ah, ah.
We’re hoping we come out of it

22:47.190 --> 22:49.250
because if we can get
into undisturbed soil,

22:49.250 --> 22:51.170
then we know no one’s
investigated that area.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.170
Yeah. That’s...

22:52.170 --> 22:53.170
We want to see a little bit
of undisturbed

22:53.170 --> 22:55.429
before we hit this tunnel.

22:55.429 --> 22:57.690
NARRATOR:
Although Shaft Six

22:57.690 --> 23:01.910
was reportedly dug to a depth
of some 118 feet,

23:01.910 --> 23:05.110
more than a century of digging
by numerous searchers

23:05.110 --> 23:08.580
has caused depth measurements
to be somewhat unreliable.

23:08.580 --> 23:11.270
Because of this,

23:11.270 --> 23:14.559
the team will carefully watch
for changes in the soil

23:14.559 --> 23:17.110
that might indicate they have
found their target tunnel.

23:17.110 --> 23:22.050
I find myself strangely excited
about today anyway, you know?

23:22.050 --> 23:24.240
I just really want it to happen.

23:24.240 --> 23:30.280
The answers are there, so...
just wait and see what comes up.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.000
TERRY:
So we’ve got to be very close

23:40.000 --> 23:40.809
to 95 feet.

23:41.109 --> 23:44.630
Well, might as well take a look.

23:45.430 --> 23:50.129
TERRY:
I think we’re there, Rick.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.350
I think we’re there.

23:53.350 --> 23:56.390
You often find boulders
associated

23:56.390 --> 23:58.780
with this bedded material,
and there it is.

23:58.780 --> 24:00.630
That’s very encouraging.

24:00.630 --> 24:05.120
It looks like we could be
coming out in, in situ.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.350
RICK:
That’s very good, then.

24:07.350 --> 24:08.350
Really.

24:08.350 --> 24:11.360
(chuckles):
We got a smile out of you.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.250
NARRATOR:
The sudden change to

24:13.250 --> 24:15.160
undisturbed or "in situ" soil

24:15.160 --> 24:17.450
is a promising sign.

24:17.450 --> 24:21.020
It suggests that the team
is digging through an area

24:21.020 --> 24:23.270
that could be close
to encountering the tunnel

24:23.270 --> 24:24.960
leading from Shaft Six

24:24.960 --> 24:27.010
to the original
Money Pit treasure vault.

24:27.010 --> 24:31.750
Where’s the, uh,
where’s the shaft at?

24:31.750 --> 24:34.290
The shaft is at 101
and six inches.

24:34.290 --> 24:38.350
Danny said that, uniquely, the
oscillator did build up torque,

24:38.350 --> 24:39.960
and then it reduced after that.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.650
Which, for drilling,
is backwards,

24:41.650 --> 24:43.790
cause the deeper we go,
the more plug we should have

24:43.790 --> 24:44.790
and it should
keep building, so...

24:44.790 --> 24:45.790
So it might have been
on this tunnel

24:45.790 --> 24:49.420
and then broke through it.
He might have cut through

24:49.420 --> 24:50.890
something or, yeah.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.350
Thatd be fabulous.

24:52.350 --> 24:53.390
NARRATOR:
News that

24:53.390 --> 24:54.830
the 60 inchwide caisson

24:54.830 --> 24:58.700
may have cut through a hard
object at a depth of 101 feet

24:58.700 --> 25:03.180
is an exciting development
for Rick, Marty and the team.

25:03.180 --> 25:06.130
If they have, in fact,
penetrated the roof

25:06.130 --> 25:07.950
of the Shaft Six tunnel,

25:07.950 --> 25:10.390
the spoils that have been
brought to the surface

25:10.390 --> 25:12.840
should contain
important evidence.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.920
For this reason,
it all must be carefully washed

25:15.920 --> 25:17.460
and searched by hand.

25:17.460 --> 25:20.720
DOUG:
Id say were right about

25:20.720 --> 25:23.440
where the top should be.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.860
Whatever were gonna find if
its there where we expect it,

25:25.860 --> 25:27.580
its gonna be inside
the can right now,

25:27.580 --> 25:30.370
at the bottom of that plug.
Yeah.

25:30.370 --> 25:33.230
TERRY:
Look at that.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.380
Thats in situ.

25:35.380 --> 25:40.210
That looks like a wider board
than weve been seeing.

25:40.210 --> 25:43.110
That seems pretty competent
right there.

25:43.110 --> 25:45.410
RICK:
You dont see that with the

25:45.410 --> 25:46.410
Chappell Shaft, do you?

25:46.410 --> 25:47.410
No. Nope.

25:47.410 --> 25:52.160
The Chappell Shaft
is almost all wellmilled.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.340
So thats interesting.

25:54.340 --> 25:57.480
And something like that could be
supporting the top of a tunnel.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.170
RICK:
Theres no question about that.

25:59.170 --> 26:00.210
DOUG:
You can see the upanddown

26:00.210 --> 26:01.720
saw marks on the face of this.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.559
Well, maybe were close.

26:03.559 --> 26:04.929
I dont know.

26:04.929 --> 26:07.200
NARRATOR:
The fact that this wood,

26:07.200 --> 26:12.040
which has just been found some
100 feet deep in the S6 shaft,

26:12.040 --> 26:15.050
features a socalled
up and down pattern,

26:15.050 --> 26:16.760
and no evidence of being cut

26:16.760 --> 26:19.170
with a more modern
circular saw,

26:19.170 --> 26:22.910
is promising evidence that it
might be hundreds of years old.

26:22.910 --> 26:26.770
But could it also mean
that it is a piece

26:26.770 --> 26:28.460
of the Shaft Six tunnel?

26:28.460 --> 26:29.980
RICK:
This is the whole ball game.

26:29.980 --> 26:32.170
If it is
the crossconnect tunnel

26:32.170 --> 26:34.520
between Shaft Six
and the Money Pit,

26:34.520 --> 26:38.130
I am absolutely certain
theres something in there.

26:38.130 --> 26:41.340
Theres the one thing.
We will find it.

26:41.340 --> 26:44.530
Id say were almost certainly
in the tunnel.

26:44.530 --> 26:46.860
DOUG:
Yeah. Were into something

26:46.860 --> 26:47.860
and I dont think

26:47.860 --> 26:48.860
its Chappell Shaft
construction.

26:48.860 --> 26:51.090
No, I dont think so, either.
Its earlier than that.

26:51.090 --> 26:54.000
Yeah. I would bet
everything on it.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.860
DOUG:
Theres so much damage here.

26:56.860 --> 27:01.100
Yeah, collapsed feature,
all of this.

27:01.100 --> 27:02.510
Whats that?

27:02.510 --> 27:04.630
Oh! Thats leather.

27:04.630 --> 27:06.740
Thats definitely leather.

27:06.740 --> 27:09.770
DOUG:
Thats leather without a doubt.

27:09.770 --> 27:13.170
Look at that.

27:13.170 --> 27:16.630
NARRATOR:
It is an exciting moment

27:16.630 --> 27:18.910
in the Oak Island
Money Pit area

27:18.910 --> 27:22.340
as Rick, Marty and the team
have just found

27:22.340 --> 27:24.840
what appears to be
a large piece of leather

27:24.840 --> 27:29.220
in the spoils of the S6 shaft.

27:29.220 --> 27:30.220
That is unusual.

27:30.220 --> 27:33.260
What the hell
is that doing down there?

27:33.260 --> 27:34.260
Theres more leather.

27:34.260 --> 27:36.420
If theres leather there,
humans were there.

27:36.420 --> 27:40.800
And you can date leather,
to a degree.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.530
Ill bag this one up.

27:43.530 --> 27:46.270
DOUG:
Yeah, lets bag it.

27:46.270 --> 27:47.270
Yep.

27:47.270 --> 27:49.080
RICK:
If this is indeed more leather,

27:49.080 --> 27:52.130
is this the remnants
of the Money Pit collapse?

27:52.130 --> 27:54.480
Its possible,
its very possible.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.490
We need to get it tested.

27:55.490 --> 27:59.020
We need to apply additional
testing methodologies,

27:59.020 --> 28:01.179
maybe C14 testing.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.620
Hey, Marty.

28:02.620 --> 28:08.390
Hey, Marty,
I want to show you something.

28:08.390 --> 28:09.390
Got something good?

28:09.390 --> 28:10.760
Got something for you.

28:10.760 --> 28:13.580
Take a look at this.

28:13.580 --> 28:18.250
What do you make of that?

28:18.250 --> 28:22.252
Gary? Charles?
Oh, I know what that is.

28:22.252 --> 28:23.450
Wow, thats a lot of it.

28:23.450 --> 28:24.450
What is it?
You ever seen

28:24.450 --> 28:25.450
anything like that?

28:25.450 --> 28:27.230
It kind of looks
like leather or felt.

28:27.230 --> 28:30.310
MARTY: At what depth?
Well, 103 for this.

28:30.310 --> 28:33.290
So they must be advanced
at 105 right now.

28:33.290 --> 28:35.790
But what do you guys make of it?

28:35.790 --> 28:38.260
You think leather?

28:38.260 --> 28:39.910
I do.

28:39.910 --> 28:41.200
That looks like a big chunk

28:41.200 --> 28:43.730
of what little bits
weve been finding.

28:43.730 --> 28:44.730
Is that leather?

28:44.730 --> 28:46.990
I think I got a bit
of leather here.

28:46.990 --> 28:48.799
NARRATOR:
During the past two years,

28:48.799 --> 28:52.620
the Oak Island team has found
numerous bits of leather,

28:52.620 --> 28:55.980
along with what they believe
to be antique paper

28:55.980 --> 29:00.230
in the H8 shaft,
located some ten feet away.

29:00.230 --> 29:04.510
These finds corroborate the
theory held by many researchers

29:04.510 --> 29:07.760
that the Oak Island treasure
might not only consist

29:07.760 --> 29:10.020
of gold or priceless artifacts,

29:10.020 --> 29:13.610
but also important
historical documents.

29:13.610 --> 29:16.230
MARTY:
You know, I should quit

29:16.230 --> 29:17.230
manipulating it

29:17.230 --> 29:18.500
cause there could be
marks on it,

29:18.500 --> 29:21.020
you know, once you clean it up.
Yeah.

29:21.020 --> 29:26.799
You got to find a little leather
before you find the gold.

29:26.799 --> 29:27.799
If that aint a saying,
it should be.

29:27.799 --> 29:28.799
(laughs)

29:28.799 --> 29:31.450
VANESSA: Were at 107.
RICK: Yeah, its in the zone.

29:31.450 --> 29:36.640
We have four and a half feet
of possibilities.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.150
RICK:
I have high hopes,

29:38.150 --> 29:39.929
in terms of finding objects.

29:39.929 --> 29:41.929
And the hope is that,

29:41.929 --> 29:43.910
within this conglomeration
of objects,

29:43.910 --> 29:46.710
that there will be
an aha moment.

29:46.710 --> 29:48.830
There will be something
in there

29:48.830 --> 29:51.020
that weve never seen before,
something that will speak.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.730
Wheres our bottom?

29:53.730 --> 29:57.860
I got some revised numbers.
Okay.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.540
So, our casing is down to 118,

30:00.540 --> 30:05.030
eight foot up from that is
the top of the plug, which is...

30:05.030 --> 30:06.324
110, is where the grab
is at right now.

30:06.324 --> 30:07.324
RICK:
Were gonna keep going

30:07.324 --> 30:08.324
until bedrock.

30:08.324 --> 30:09.324
If this is within the collapse
of the Money Pit, you know,

30:09.324 --> 30:10.660
you drive it to rock and hope
something fell all the way down.

30:10.660 --> 30:11.660
DOUG:
Whoa!

30:11.660 --> 30:12.660
Look at that one, Terry.
TERRY:

30:12.660 --> 30:13.660
Look at those ones, yeah.

30:13.660 --> 30:19.320
Hey, Doug, take a look at this.

30:19.320 --> 30:24.470
DOUG:
Thats a lot of wood, Terry.

30:24.470 --> 30:26.450
Timber.
TERRY: Look, look, look.

30:26.450 --> 30:30.420
Thats a nice chunk.
Look at the flat surface there.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.320
DOUG:
Thats more like something

30:32.320 --> 30:33.320
wed be looking for.

30:33.320 --> 30:35.150
TERRY: Its handhewn, yeah.
PAUL: Well, its nice

30:35.150 --> 30:37.350
and flat, too.

30:37.350 --> 30:40.299
But thats definitely handaxed.

30:40.299 --> 30:42.070
NARRATOR:
Axecut wood,

30:42.070 --> 30:46.200
found at a depth
of 110 feet in S6?

30:46.200 --> 30:48.310
What does that mean?

30:48.310 --> 30:51.090
Were beyond the tunnel.

30:51.090 --> 30:53.100
NARRATOR:
Could the team have already

30:53.100 --> 30:54.100
reached the bottom

30:54.100 --> 30:55.960
of the Shaft Six tunnel?

30:55.960 --> 30:59.130
Or could this be evidence
of something much older?

30:59.130 --> 31:01.160
CHARLES:
Some more of it coming up.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.900
TERRY:
Look at those ones, yeah.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.480
Thats what I wanted to see.

31:04.480 --> 31:07.940
Were getting up
very, very large chunks of till

31:07.940 --> 31:10.330
and the boards
are embedded within it.

31:10.330 --> 31:13.820
Come, come over here
and just take a look

31:13.820 --> 31:15.380
at where you pulled it out of.
See what I me

31:15.380 --> 31:18.400
Its embedded in the clay,

31:18.400 --> 31:20.039
so it was structurally
supporting something.

31:20.039 --> 31:21.039
Yep.

31:21.039 --> 31:24.039
Thats some big timbers.
VANESSA: Wow.

31:24.039 --> 31:27.470
Those are some
really big timbers.

31:27.470 --> 31:29.750
Yeah, there we go.

31:29.750 --> 31:33.760
There. Lets take it
over this way.

31:33.760 --> 31:36.610
Holy crap. Look at that.

31:36.610 --> 31:40.620
Thats oak.
Theres no question about that.

31:40.620 --> 31:42.900
BILLY: Yeah.
PAUL: Yeah.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.960
NARRATOR:
While excavating inside

31:44.960 --> 31:46.260
Borehole S6...

31:46.260 --> 31:47.560
Thats oak.

31:47.560 --> 31:50.830
NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina and
members of the Oak Island team

31:50.830 --> 31:53.419
have just made
a significant discovery

31:53.419 --> 31:55.360
an oak timber,

31:55.360 --> 31:59.419
found at a depth of 110 feet.

31:59.419 --> 32:01.340
When you scratch the dirt off,

32:01.340 --> 32:04.100
it looks like oak
to me for sure.

32:04.100 --> 32:05.740
RICK:
Theres no question about that.

32:05.740 --> 32:07.360
NARRATOR:
When the original Money Pit

32:07.360 --> 32:08.360
was excavated

32:08.360 --> 32:10.650
more than two centuries ago,

32:10.650 --> 32:13.370
searchers reported
finding nine platforms

32:13.370 --> 32:16.760
every ten feet,
constructed of oak logs.

32:16.760 --> 32:21.890
Could this timber,
found in S6,

32:21.890 --> 32:25.340
be part of the wood cribbing
from the original Money Pit?

32:25.340 --> 32:27.559
The original "Money Pit"

32:27.559 --> 32:30.000
was described as having
found oak timber,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.920
so we believe that some
of this material isis oak.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.000
Uh, its the first time
that weve ever seen it,

32:37.000 --> 32:40.200
and if these are oak,
itsits very interesting.

32:40.200 --> 32:46.419
You guys look like youre trying
to build a shaft.

32:46.419 --> 32:48.700
Whats going on? Whats that?

32:48.700 --> 32:50.530
Oak. Thats definitely oak.

32:50.530 --> 32:52.720
The Money Pit collapsed in 1861

32:52.720 --> 32:55.740
and a whole bunch of wood
sort of "went missing."

32:55.740 --> 32:59.010
Well, the bottom of the
Money Pit was never explored.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.420
So these massive oak timbers

33:01.420 --> 33:03.470
may be part of the
original construct

33:03.470 --> 33:05.640
and thethe other timbers
were finding

33:05.640 --> 33:07.250
are part of the
recribbing attempts

33:07.250 --> 33:08.419
to get to the treasure chamber.

33:08.419 --> 33:13.690
Rick, what do you think
of these big timbers?

33:13.690 --> 33:15.550
I dont know. What do you think?

33:15.550 --> 33:17.650
I know what I think.
What?

33:17.650 --> 33:21.160
That these remind me,
these big ones, of ship timbers.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.970
Yeah.
These big ones.

33:22.970 --> 33:26.510
Ive been on beaches
after hurricanes in Florida,

33:26.510 --> 33:29.650
and the parts of the wrecks
have washed up

33:29.650 --> 33:32.120
and this is exactly
what they look like.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.730
Ships timbers.

33:33.730 --> 33:37.210
NARRATOR:
Timbers from a ship?

33:37.210 --> 33:40.650
Based on evidence
found around the island,

33:40.650 --> 33:42.080
many Oak Island theorists

33:42.080 --> 33:44.860
have speculated that
the original Money Pit

33:44.860 --> 33:48.840
was constructed by using
repurposed wood and materials

33:48.840 --> 33:51.169
taken from some type
of large sailing vessel.

33:51.169 --> 33:54.730
Is it possible
that a ship that was used

33:54.730 --> 33:56.350
to bring treasure to the island

33:56.350 --> 33:58.820
was then deliberately
broken apart,

33:58.820 --> 34:01.840
not only to construct
a secure hiding place,

34:01.840 --> 34:06.540
but also to destroy evidence
that the ship even existed?

34:06.540 --> 34:10.750
And could this oak timber,
found in the S6 shaft,

34:10.750 --> 34:15.340
offer tangible evidence that
this incredible theory is true?

34:15.340 --> 34:17.199
MARTY:
Theyre, um,

34:17.199 --> 34:20.190
handhewn, clearly.
You can see the axe

34:20.190 --> 34:22.510
or adze marks, and theyre oak,

34:22.510 --> 34:24.719
which would be the only oak
weve ever seen

34:24.719 --> 34:26.609
underground, I think.
Pretty much.

34:26.609 --> 34:28.300
GARY:
It looks like two different

34:28.300 --> 34:29.350
types of timbers

34:29.350 --> 34:31.918
as well, like theyre reused.
MARTY: Thats no question.

34:31.918 --> 34:34.420
No, Im thinking were
in two different structures.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.420
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:35.420 --> 34:36.770
Thats what it looks like.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.080
So what a shock.

34:38.080 --> 34:40.389
The day ends
and we have another mystery.

34:40.389 --> 34:42.750
(laughing)
Lets call it a night

34:42.750 --> 34:43.750
for right now. Get some rest,

34:43.750 --> 34:47.310
get back at it!
Yeah.

34:47.310 --> 34:53.929
NARRATOR:
As a new day dawns

34:53.929 --> 34:56.030
on Oak Island,

34:56.030 --> 34:57.430
Jack Begley,

34:57.430 --> 35:00.170
Doug Crowell and Paul Troutman

35:00.170 --> 35:02.090
are continuing
to carefully sift

35:02.090 --> 35:04.310
through the spoils
recently excavated

35:04.310 --> 35:05.890
from Borehole S6,

35:05.890 --> 35:08.400
the site where
the team has found

35:08.400 --> 35:09.860
evidence that may have come

35:09.860 --> 35:11.340
from the Money Pit
treasure shaft.

35:11.340 --> 35:14.560
Look at this.

35:14.560 --> 35:22.119
DOUG: Whatd you find?
JACK: Its a piece of a chain.

35:22.119 --> 35:23.960
DOUG: Oh!
PAUL: Oh, wow, look at that.

35:23.960 --> 35:26.119
NARRATOR:
A piece of iron chain?

35:26.119 --> 35:28.580
Found in the S6 spoils?

35:28.580 --> 35:31.930
This could be a part of the
collapse from the treasure.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.580
PAUL:
Well you know, Jack,

35:33.580 --> 35:34.760
one of the theories, the chain

35:34.760 --> 35:36.880
was used to chain a slave
down there or somebody

35:36.880 --> 35:38.580
that was a part of
a huge workforce

35:38.580 --> 35:40.830
to build the Money Pit.
Yeah.

35:40.830 --> 35:43.160
NARRATOR:
According to legend,

35:43.160 --> 35:45.540
after a vast treasure
was buried

35:45.540 --> 35:47.380
in the Oak Island Money Pit,

35:47.380 --> 35:49.790
some of the slaves
who dug the shaft

35:49.790 --> 35:52.450
were chained to a post
and buried alive

35:52.450 --> 35:53.450
deep underground.

35:53.450 --> 35:54.920
(shouting)

35:54.920 --> 35:57.740
NARRATOR:
This was done so that the

35:57.740 --> 35:59.160
victims vengeful spirits

35:59.160 --> 36:01.420
would forever guard
the treasure vault

36:01.420 --> 36:05.000
and curse anyone who dare try
to remove the contents.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.850
Could this piece of chain,

36:07.850 --> 36:11.500
along with the fragments
of human bone found last year,

36:11.500 --> 36:13.800
be disturbing evidence
that this legend

36:13.800 --> 36:15.480
has a basis in truth?

36:15.480 --> 36:17.910
Hey, Gary.
What you got, guys?

36:17.910 --> 36:20.910
All right, we need
your professional opinion.

36:20.910 --> 36:23.420
DOUG:
What do you think about that?

36:23.420 --> 36:24.590
Chain link.

36:24.590 --> 36:26.390
Yeah...
A link of a chain.

36:26.390 --> 36:28.620
How old would you say
it is, though?

36:28.620 --> 36:31.040
Yeah, its quite meaty.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.680
Its an older one

36:32.680 --> 36:36.090
by the look of it
because you go on the shape.

36:36.090 --> 36:37.099
With old chains,

36:37.099 --> 36:40.810
the older links of chain
are always oval, not round,

36:40.810 --> 36:43.480
and that looks like its oval.

36:43.480 --> 36:47.610
Obviously, its been
through some stress.

36:47.610 --> 36:49.820
It really looks old.
Yeah. It does look old.

36:49.820 --> 36:53.150
It really does, and what I like
about it is the weight.

36:53.150 --> 36:56.480
It would be handforged.
Where it came out,

36:56.480 --> 36:59.970
it was probably used
on a pulley system.

36:59.970 --> 37:01.890
So you think it
couldve been original

37:01.890 --> 37:04.359
for depositing the treasure?

37:04.359 --> 37:06.180
Or something that was
left behind by searchers?

37:06.180 --> 37:07.320
I dont know but it yeah.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.780
We were looking for
a debris field in the tunnel

37:09.780 --> 37:10.840
and that is,

37:10.840 --> 37:12.820
in my mind, is a possible
piece of debris

37:12.820 --> 37:14.390
from the original...
Yeah.

37:14.390 --> 37:15.990
...treasure vault, right?
But, yeah,

37:15.990 --> 37:17.820
definitely we should
have this tested.

37:17.820 --> 37:20.470
NARRATOR:
Could Gary Draytons notion

37:20.470 --> 37:23.620
that the chain might
actually have been used

37:23.620 --> 37:27.130
to deposit something of great
value deep in the Money Pit

37:27.130 --> 37:28.870
be true?

37:28.870 --> 37:33.580
And, if so, what else
might the team find

37:33.580 --> 37:35.020
buried nearby?

37:35.020 --> 37:36.540
Theres got to be more goodies

37:36.540 --> 37:40.190
stashed away in here somewhere.

37:47.190 --> 37:49.480
GARY:
I think thats bone.

37:52.180 --> 37:55.400
NARRATOR:
While searching through

37:55.400 --> 37:56.400
the spoils

37:56.400 --> 37:59.210
from shaft S6,
Oak Island researcher

37:59.210 --> 38:02.700
Doug Crowell may have just made
an important discovery.

38:02.700 --> 38:05.400
You think its bone?
Yeah, I think thats bone.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.090
It looks like bone.
Its kind of porous like it.

38:07.090 --> 38:10.150
Oh, yeah, I think this
is bone for sure.

38:10.150 --> 38:11.530
Thats bone.

38:11.530 --> 38:12.910
NARRATOR:
Bone?

38:12.910 --> 38:15.370
If it can be determined
to be human,

38:15.370 --> 38:18.210
could it be matched to one
of the two individuals

38:18.210 --> 38:21.280
whose remains
were found last year?

38:21.280 --> 38:24.359
Or might it belong
to someone else?

38:24.359 --> 38:27.700
Oh, you can see the capillary
holes on the side.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.220
Yeah, youyou can just see
the way thats cut.

38:29.220 --> 38:30.820
Thats bone, mate. Good eye.
JACK: Cool, cool.

38:30.820 --> 38:32.090
DOUG:
Well, the fact that we found it

38:32.090 --> 38:34.870
from the Shaft Six spoils means
theres possibly other debris

38:34.870 --> 38:36.020
that drifted away from H8,

38:36.020 --> 38:38.640
all the way further north
like we were expecting.

38:38.640 --> 38:42.480
If the Money Pit is H8,
or around there,

38:42.480 --> 38:43.870
then possibly theres more

38:43.870 --> 38:46.340
than just treasure
that was deposited there.

38:46.340 --> 38:47.430
There might be remains.

38:47.430 --> 38:50.099
GARY:
Well done, Doug.

38:50.099 --> 38:51.099
That was good eye.

38:51.099 --> 38:52.099
That changes everything.

38:52.099 --> 38:53.910
I knew thered be
something good in there.

38:53.910 --> 38:56.230
Well?
DOUG: Hey, Rick.

38:56.230 --> 38:59.130
Hows it going?
Good news.

38:59.130 --> 39:05.230
Look what Doug just found.

39:05.230 --> 39:10.790
RICK:
That is a bone.

39:10.790 --> 39:12.470
Theres no question about that.

39:12.470 --> 39:13.470
Yeah.

39:13.470 --> 39:15.390
GARY:
Well, thats pretty exciting,

39:15.390 --> 39:17.760
finding a piece of bone
on the wash table, again.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.280
S6, though.
Why S6 and not H8?

39:20.280 --> 39:23.550
The debris field
into the tunnel.

39:23.550 --> 39:25.860
If it all originates
in the Money Pit,

39:25.860 --> 39:28.950
it could explain
Chappell Shaft, H8,

39:28.950 --> 39:30.859
and into our tunnel.
It could.

39:30.859 --> 39:33.870
But what are all these bones
doing in the Money Pit area?

39:33.870 --> 39:35.560
RICK:
Hey, look, anythings possible.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.540
One step at a time,
get it tested,

39:37.540 --> 39:40.110
and if its human bone,
then we take it from there,

39:40.110 --> 39:41.110
step by step.

39:41.110 --> 39:43.960
Its a good find,
but lets keep going. (chuckles)

39:43.960 --> 39:46.210
And its crazy
cause we are cold,

39:46.210 --> 39:48.260
wet and down and then

39:48.260 --> 39:50.070
something like this
lifts our spirits.

39:50.070 --> 39:52.170
Thats why were doing it.

39:52.170 --> 39:55.109
Well, great, you know,
thatsthats good news.

39:55.109 --> 39:56.690
Bag it, mark it,
and well send it off.

39:56.690 --> 40:00.210
I think theres a lot to be
learned yet. Well certainly

40:00.210 --> 40:01.210
have some DNA analysis done.

40:01.210 --> 40:05.080
Are they human?
Are they not? But look,

40:05.080 --> 40:08.440
if they are human,
and theyre at these depths,

40:08.440 --> 40:10.990
theres a story here,
and we need to unravel it.

40:10.990 --> 40:13.750
Look, I want to just thank you
guys for being out here.

40:13.750 --> 40:15.109
Were all wet, were all cold,

40:15.109 --> 40:17.220
but I think wewe
cant quit now, right?

40:17.220 --> 40:18.310
No.
These last two tables

40:18.310 --> 40:19.770
have been significant, so, look,

40:19.770 --> 40:21.650
maybe the next one
will be the one thing.

40:21.650 --> 40:24.280
Okay, well, lets get after it.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.770
NARRATOR:
For the Laginas

40:26.770 --> 40:27.770
and their partners,

40:27.770 --> 40:31.330
it has been a week
of incredible new discoveries.

40:31.330 --> 40:33.820
From ancient leather,

40:33.820 --> 40:36.630
to oak timbers
that may have been part

40:36.630 --> 40:38.780
of the original Money Pit,

40:38.780 --> 40:42.220
and disturbing evidence
that an Oak Island legend

40:42.220 --> 40:44.900
might actually be true.
(shouting)

40:44.900 --> 40:47.550
NARRATOR:
A series of incredible

40:47.550 --> 40:48.550
puzzle pieces

40:48.550 --> 40:50.440
are starting
to be put into place.

40:50.440 --> 40:54.210
But what picture
are they forming?

40:54.210 --> 40:56.290
One of a vast treasure

40:56.290 --> 40:58.390
buried deep underground?

40:58.390 --> 41:00.550
Or something else?

41:00.550 --> 41:04.000
Something that suggests
the key to unlocking

41:04.000 --> 41:05.839
a centuriesold mystery

41:05.839 --> 41:08.980
isnt one of gold and silver,

41:08.980 --> 41:12.090
but of iron

41:12.090 --> 41:17.280
and bits of human bone.

41:17.280 --> 41:20.240
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:20.240 --> 41:22.960
RICK:
These items came from a tunnel

41:22.960 --> 41:24.060
associated with the Money Pit.

41:24.060 --> 41:25.320
MARTY:
We might be closing in.

41:25.320 --> 41:27.390
Human beings were down there.

41:27.390 --> 41:28.740
This is the kind of thing
you were hoping for.

41:28.740 --> 41:30.280
Oh, really?
I would put it

41:30.280 --> 41:31.540
in the early 1700s.

41:31.540 --> 41:35.230
Wow, look at that.
Fits like a glove.

41:35.230 --> 41:37.720
Know what this reminds me of?
What?

41:37.720 --> 41:40.620
The hole in the cross.

41:40.620 --> 41:42.520
TOBIAS SKOWRONEK:
The lead isotope data here

41:42.520 --> 41:43.520
is identical to the cross.

41:43.520 --> 41:44.520
Excellent.
MARTY: Wow.

41:44.520 --> 41:44.950
