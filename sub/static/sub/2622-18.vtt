WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:06.338
- Hey.
- Hey. Wow, it is true what they say:

00:06.506 --> 00:08.298
Pregnant bellies look like a drum.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.011
Ha, ha.

00:12.178 --> 00:16.765
Well, it's just I'm so pregnant
that my guitar doesn't fit anymore.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.768
So I thought, till I'm not,
I'm gonna play my songs on this drum.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.645
It sounds really cool.

00:21.813 --> 00:25.274
Listen, listen. Ahem. Okay.

00:25.942 --> 00:29.319
Smelly cat, smelly cat

00:29.487 --> 00:32.906
What are they feeding you?

00:38.913 --> 00:40.122
Wow, Pheebs, that sounds great.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.709
I know, I know! And I've only been playing
for, like, an hour.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.881
- Phoebe. Phoebe. Hi.
- Hey.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.090
What are you doing here?

00:50.258 --> 00:52.593
Um, actually I came down
to ask you a big favor.

00:52.761 --> 00:56.513
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep
more of your stuff in my uterus.

00:58.767 --> 01:02.394
No, no, no. Okay. Now, see. Ahem.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.938
I want to name the girl baby Leslie.

01:05.105 --> 01:08.734
And, um, Frank wants to name
one of the boy babies...

01:08.902 --> 01:10.694
...Frank Jr., Jr.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.989
Wouldn't that be Frank III?

01:14.365 --> 01:16.200
Don't get me started.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.120
Anyway, um,
since there are three babies...

01:20.288 --> 01:23.624
...and, um, we both got
to put our names in...

01:23.792 --> 01:27.336
...we would be truly honored
if you would name the other boy baby.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.129
Oh, wow.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.673
- That's so nice. Oh, oh!
- Ha, ha.

01:31.841 --> 01:32.883
Cougar.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.220
You think about it.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.359
I left a bra drying on the shower rod.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.445
You don't think your son
will think it's yours and be traumatized?

02:35.613 --> 02:38.323
Hey, Mommy can have a wife.
Daddy can have a bra.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.119
Oh, it's time to go.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.746
Oh, no, no, no.
See, that clock's a little fast.

02:44.914 --> 02:48.041
Uh, we still have 17 minutes.

02:48.209 --> 02:51.295
Huh. What can we do in 17 minutes...

02:51.462 --> 02:52.754
...twice?

02:53.715 --> 02:55.924
Well, that's ambitious.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.596
- Okay, you can ignore that.
- That's Carol with your son.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.931
Uh, believe me, when he's older,
he'll understand.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.477
- Ross.
- I'll be right there.

03:11.900 --> 03:16.028
- Hello. Hello. Hey.
- Hi.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.030
Uh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.366
- Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you.
- You too.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.328
Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial
in London next week.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.079
I'm so excited. I've never been there.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.081
- Oh, well, I'll show you around.
- Great.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.752
Also, I was hoping to catch a show.
So if you can make any suggestions...

03:31.920 --> 03:33.754
Oh, there's tons of terrific stuff.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.256
- I'll go with you.
- Oh.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.507
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.802
Oh. Look at you two bonding.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.264
- Making us late for the airport so...
- Are you all right?

03:44.432 --> 03:47.976
Oh, he's fine, he's fine. It's just
us getting along is difficult for him...

03:48.144 --> 03:50.646
...because he doesn't like me.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.564
Ha, ha. Come on. That's...

03:52.732 --> 03:53.941
It's true.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.032
- Hi.
- Hey. Hey, do we have a baby name yet?

04:02.200 --> 04:04.451
Ugh, no. It's so hard.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.079
I went through this whole book
and found nothing.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.874
I want a name that's really, like,
you know, strong and confident.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.960
You know? Like Exxon.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.673
Well, it certainly worked
for that Valdez kid.

04:18.632 --> 04:22.886
Oh, oh, Pheebs. You want a strong name?
How about The Hulk?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.764
No, I'm not sure about Hulk...

04:25.932 --> 04:28.684
...but I like the idea
of a name starting with "The."

04:29.811 --> 04:32.521
Well, you want a good name,
heh, go with Joey.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.523
Joey's your pal, Joey's your buddy.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.109
Where is everybody?
They're hanging out with Joey.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.529
Know what?
If you're gonna name him Joey...

04:40.697 --> 04:42.572
...you should name him Chandler.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.994
Oh, come on, Chandler's funny,
he's sophisticated, and he's very lovable...

04:47.161 --> 04:49.538
...once you get to know him.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.040
Hey, Joey's lovable too.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.669
But the thing about Joey is,
if you need him, he'll be there.

04:55.837 --> 05:00.090
Chandler will be there for you too.
I mean, he might be a little late...

05:00.258 --> 05:02.884
...but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you some cold soda...

05:03.052 --> 05:06.513
...if what you need him for
is that you're really hot.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.349
What do you say? What do you say?

05:09.517 --> 05:14.062
Well, I like the idea of naming him
after someone I love.

05:14.230 --> 05:17.316
And Joey and Chandler
are both great names.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.573
All right, I don't...

05:24.741 --> 05:26.867
Maybe I will just name him The Hulk.

05:28.494 --> 05:32.622
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it.
That's what I wanted to name my kid.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.587
Hey, Mon? If you were hoping to sleep
with Joshua for the first time tonight...

05:38.755 --> 05:40.839
...which one of these
would you want to be wearing?

05:41.007 --> 05:44.968
You know what? It really creeps me out
choosing other people's sex clothes.

05:45.636 --> 05:48.597
Sorry. I'm just so excited.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.558
I've been waiting for this for months.
I got my hair colored.

05:51.726 --> 05:55.354
I got new sheets.
I'm making him a very fancy meal.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.230
What am I making him, by the way?

05:57.690 --> 06:02.069
Well, you're making him a frisÃ©e salad
with goat cheese and pine nuts...

06:02.236 --> 06:06.073
...wild rice, roasted asparagus
and salmon en croute.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.450
I thought I was making him filet mignon.

06:09.911 --> 06:13.663
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make
salmon because you had some left over.

06:13.831 --> 06:17.042
And then you realized if you bitched
about it, then you would stop cooking...

06:17.210 --> 06:21.254
...and you would have to make your
famous baked potato and Diet Coke.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.050
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.637
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.055
Hey.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.307
So, uh, Emily called last night.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.351
And now you're giving me the message?

06:38.606 --> 06:42.317
Turns out that Emily
is just crazy about Susan.

06:42.485 --> 06:46.154
Yeah.
They're going to the theater together.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.657
They're going to dinner.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.076
They're going horseback riding.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.704
God, Susan is so fun.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.710
Look, this is just a little too familiar.

07:00.878 --> 07:04.172
Okay, for, like, six months
before Carol and I split up...

07:04.340 --> 07:08.510
...all I heard was,
"My friend Susan is so smart.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.764
My friend Susan is so funny.
My friend Susan is so great."

07:13.724 --> 07:17.018
You actually think that something
could happen between Emily and Susan?

07:17.186 --> 07:20.063
Hey, they're going to the gym together.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.066
Two women...

07:23.234 --> 07:24.860
...stretching.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.572
You know, they take a steam together,
things get a little playful.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.490
Didn't you see Personal Best?

07:30.658 --> 07:32.659
No, but I'm gonna.

07:34.912 --> 07:37.164
Hi. Hi. You're crazy.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.916
Okay, this is Emily. Emily is straight.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.126
How do you know?

07:41.294 --> 07:43.795
I mean, we thought Carol was straight
before I married her.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.966
Yeah, definitely.
I don't like the name Ross.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.889
What a weird way to kick me
when I'm down.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.058
No, no, I just meant for the baby.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.852
Oh.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.439
What's wrong with Ross?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.399
It's just, you know, something like this...

08:04.567 --> 08:06.818
...would never happen to The Hulk,
you know.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.614
Actually, that's not true.

08:10.781 --> 08:15.410
In The Incredible Hulk, number 72,
Dr. Bruce Banner found...

08:17.038 --> 08:20.499
You know, never mind.
My girlfriend's a lesbian.

08:23.294 --> 08:26.463
So I decided I'm definitely gonna go
with either Joey or Chandler.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.215
- Oh.
- Oh, oh, oh.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.175
You gotta pick Joey.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.885
I mean, name one famous person
named Chandler.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.681
- Raymond Chandler.
- Someone you didn't make up.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.936
Okay, there are no famous Joeys.
Except for, heh...

08:41.102 --> 08:42.520
...Joey Buttafuoco.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.566
- Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
- Yeah.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.111
Well, how about a compromise then?
Okay, what if it's...

08:50.279 --> 08:52.864
...you know, Chan-no-ey?

08:53.282 --> 08:56.743
Okay, look, Joey? Come on, think about it.
He'll never be president.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.371
I mean, there's never gonna be
a President Joey.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.207
All right, look,
I didn't want to bring this up.

09:02.375 --> 09:06.628
But Chandler is the stupidest name
I've heard in my life.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.214
It's not even a name.
It's barely even a word.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.758
Okay, it's kind of like chandelier
but it's not.

09:13.970 --> 09:18.473
All right? It's a stupid, stupid,
non-name.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.186
Wow.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.857
You're right.
I have a horrible, horrible name.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.155
I'm sorry, man. I didn't... I'm sorry.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.534
So I guess it's Joey, then. I mean...

09:45.626 --> 09:48.420
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.673
Oh. Please. Cooking soothes me.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.263
- So dig in.
- All right.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.474
- Well, it all looks so good.
- Mm.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.435
Mm.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.687
Oh, my God.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.189
Oh, I know. My God, this rice is so...

10:08.357 --> 10:10.400
I am so good.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.444
Behind you.

10:13.904 --> 10:17.866
Oh, yeah, sorry. They used to live here,
and sometimes they migrate back over.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.871
Is there, uh...? Is there some way
that they could, uh, not be here?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.832
It's just that, uh, farm birds
really kind of freak me out.

10:26.876 --> 10:30.045
- Yeah. Okay, okay.
- Okay, great.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.339
Here we go. Here we go. Whoa.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.592
- Whoa.
- Oh, sorry.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.927
There you go.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.397
Hey. How'd you do that?

10:49.565 --> 10:50.899
Come on.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.694
- All gone.
- Heh.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.154
So, farm birds, huh?

10:56.322 --> 10:59.574
Yeah, it's my only weird thing, I swear.

10:59.742 --> 11:03.662
And I would have told you about it
but I didn't know that they'd be here.

11:03.829 --> 11:07.916
- Oh.
- So, uh, ahem.

11:08.542 --> 11:11.211
- Ha, ha.
- Okay.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.838
So can I serve you a little...

11:14.006 --> 11:15.298
What, what, what?

11:15.466 --> 11:20.011
Nothing. Uh, it's just that I know
that they're still out there.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.849
They're across the hall.
I mean, that's two doors away.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.812
It's gonna take them a long time
to peck their way back over here.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.565
That's not funny.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.777
- Uh...
- Okay, you know...

11:35.945 --> 11:39.406
Would you feel better
if we went someplace else?

11:39.573 --> 11:43.451
I mean, we could pack all this stuff up
and, you know, go to your apartment.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.745
Oh, they're working on it this week.
It's a mess.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.915
But, uh, I'm staying at my parents' house.
We could go there.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.709
- Your parents'?
- They're out of town.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.585
Oh.

11:52.753 --> 11:56.673
It's a huge place,
and it's got this gorgeous view of the park.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.341
It'd be very, very romantic.

11:58.801 --> 12:02.387
- What do you say?
- Yeah, that works.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.015
They can smell the fear.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.270
Hey.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.563
How's Ben?

12:11.731 --> 12:15.233
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat.
He said no.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.777
I asked him if he wanted to sleep.
He said no.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.905
I asked what he wanted to do.
He said no.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.782
So he's sweeping.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.161
Hey, buddy. Hey.

12:26.328 --> 12:29.289
So, um, any word from Susan?

12:29.457 --> 12:32.792
Ooh, yeah, she said she's having
so much fun with Emily.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.919
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.966
Uh, by the by,
did it ever occur to you that...

12:40.134 --> 12:44.179
...I don't know, maybe they might
be having a little too much fun?

12:44.346 --> 12:45.638
What's too much fun?

12:45.806 --> 12:49.309
You know, the kind of fun you
and Susan had when we were married.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.687
Oh, my God. You are so paranoid.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.481
- Am I?
- Yes.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.191
Am I?

12:56.692 --> 12:57.817
I can't speak for Emily...

12:57.985 --> 13:00.612
...but Susan is in a loving,
committed relationship.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.740
Uh-huh. Carol, so were we.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.701
All right, just imagine for a moment...

13:07.036 --> 13:10.246
...that Susan meets someone,
and they really hit it off.

13:10.414 --> 13:12.582
Say they're coming back
from the theater...

13:12.750 --> 13:15.376
...and they stop at a pub
for a couple of drinks.

13:15.544 --> 13:17.837
They're laughing, you know.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.381
Someone innocently touches
someone else.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.759
There's electricity.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.886
It's new. It's exciting.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.556
Are you telling me
there isn't even the slightest possibility...

13:28.724 --> 13:30.600
...of something happening?

13:32.144 --> 13:33.686
- Maybe.
- Oh, my God.

13:33.854 --> 13:36.898
I didn't really believe it
until you just said it.

13:41.529 --> 13:46.241
None of the other kids believed me,
I swear to God, that duck pushed me.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.078
Wow. This place is fabulous.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.122
Yeah, let me show you around.
This is the downstairs living room.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.124
There's two living rooms?

13:55.292 --> 14:00.046
God, growing up here, this place
must have been a real babe magnet.

14:00.214 --> 14:03.550
Yeah, well, it would have been,
but, uh, my parents just moved here.

14:03.717 --> 14:07.095
Well, you should know this place
is a real babe magnet.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.430
Want to make out?

14:11.308 --> 14:15.436
You know, here's an idea.
Why don't I put the food in the fridge...

14:15.604 --> 14:18.147
...and we can eat it later?

14:18.315 --> 14:20.275
- That sounds like a plan.
- Heh.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.403
Um, is there a place
that I could go freshen up?

14:23.571 --> 14:28.032
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, just down the hall
and, uh, second door to your left.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.205
- Oh, hi, darling.
- Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?

14:34.373 --> 14:38.293
- Oh, we cut the trip short.
- France sucks.

14:39.503 --> 14:43.172
Um, this may be a little weird,
but I've got a date here.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.632
Say no more.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.927
We'll just grab some food, take it
with us upstairs and be out of your hair.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.930
Oh, that'd be great.
So you didn't even get to Italy?

14:51.098 --> 14:53.016
Yep. Sucks.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.291
Hi, you.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.669
Oh, my God.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.964
I know. I can do more than cook.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.592
Uh...

15:32.014 --> 15:34.766
I like her. She seems smart.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.607
Rachel, my parents.

15:42.775 --> 15:46.694
So nice to meet you. Hello, hello.

15:47.321 --> 15:52.450
Oh, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

15:53.994 --> 15:58.873
What, this? Oh, no. That's not what it is.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.875
Okay, I work in fashion.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.921
See, and this is a real dress, actually.

16:05.089 --> 16:08.174
They're wearing it in Milan.

16:08.342 --> 16:12.720
So part of my job is to wear the clothes
and then I see how people respond.

16:12.888 --> 16:17.767
And then I report back to my superiors
at Bloomingdale's, so...

16:17.935 --> 16:20.478
And obviously, in this case...

16:20.646 --> 16:23.398
...I am going to report back:

16:23.607 --> 16:26.734
"U.S.A. Not ready."

16:27.528 --> 16:29.570
- Maybe in L.A.
- Yes.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.824
- There you go.
- So have you kids eaten yet?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.535
Well, ahem, we were going to do that after.
I mean, um...

16:37.121 --> 16:38.997
- Next.
- Well, we're starving.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.791
Why don't we just all
go get something to eat?

16:41.959 --> 16:47.839
Yeah, well, ha, ha, no use wasting this baby
just lying around the house.

16:48.757 --> 16:51.384
- So we'll go eat.
- Yeah.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.261
You'll wear that.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.764
We'll be eating and, of course,
you'll be wearing that.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.936
Dude, I am sorry about what I said.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.106
Nope, nope, you're right.
It is a ridiculous name.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.608
- It's not that bad.
- Yes, it is.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.320
From now on, I have no first name.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.451
So you're just Bing?

17:18.328 --> 17:20.288
I have no name.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.249
So, what are we supposed to call you?

17:23.500 --> 17:27.002
Okay, uh, for now, temporarily,
you can call me...

17:27.796 --> 17:29.172
...Clint.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.551
No way are you cool enough
to pull off "Clint."

17:33.719 --> 17:36.054
Okay, so, what name am I
cool enough to pull off?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.056
Um, Gene.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.228
It's Clint. It's Clint.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.647
- See you later, Gene.
- Bye, Gene.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.651
It's Clint. Clint!

17:53.572 --> 17:55.364
What's up with Gene?

17:59.411 --> 18:01.788
- You wore your nightie to dinner?
- Oh, yeah.

18:01.955 --> 18:05.833
And the best part though, was when
the waiter spilled water down my back.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.127
I jumped up and my boob popped out.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.088
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.090
Yeah, it's all right. I got nice boobs.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.804
So I just picked up
a message from Emily.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.390
She and Susan are going
to a poetry reading together.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.768
- So?
- So?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.728
Poetry?

18:25.896 --> 18:28.106
Susan's gay.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.608
They're being gay together.

18:31.610 --> 18:35.113
- Emily's straight.
- Oh, wake up.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.740
Wow.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.284
Carol really messed you up.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.869
Excuse me?

18:42.037 --> 18:48.292
She turned you into this untrusting,
crazy, jealous sycophant.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.757
All right, so I don't know what "sycophant"
means, but the rest is right.

18:55.884 --> 18:59.428
I don't know what you're talking about.
I am not a crazy, jealous person.

18:59.930 --> 19:00.972
Huh.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.475
- What?
- She's totally right.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.353
When we were together,
you got all freaked out about Mark...

19:07.521 --> 19:10.064
...and there was nothing going on.
- This makes sense.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.732
It does not.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.735
Sure it does. In high school,
you weren't jealous at all...

19:14.903 --> 19:17.697
...even though all your girlfriends
were cheating on you.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.743
All right, so up until '92, '93,
he was very trusting.

19:22.911 --> 19:26.539
Then '94 hit, Carol left him,
and bam. Paranoid City.

19:26.707 --> 19:27.999
Yeah.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.500
Absolutely, absolutely.

19:29.668 --> 19:30.835
This is so much fun.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.880
This is not fun.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.842
Look, all we're trying to say is...

19:38.010 --> 19:41.637
...don't let what happened with Carol
ruin what you've got with Emily.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.850
The '92 Ross wouldn't.

19:51.231 --> 19:54.358
I still think I was right
about that whole Mark thing, though.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.154
Wha...? Well, you know what?
I hope Emily is a lesbian.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.996
Drum roll.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.873
Okay. Okay.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.583
All right.

20:11.251 --> 20:15.463
Help. Am I a Mark or a John?

20:16.465 --> 20:19.300
Ehh, you're not tall enough to be a Mark.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.261
But you might make a good Barney.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.264
All right, look, I am serious.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.892
Tomorrow at 3:30,
I'm going to the courthouse.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.727
You're actually going through with this?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.647
Hey, look, this name has been
holding me back my entire life.

20:32.814 --> 20:36.651
Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me
and why I never do well with women.

20:36.818 --> 20:40.571
So as of 4:00 tomorrow, I'm either gonna be
Mark Johnson or John Markson.

20:42.157 --> 20:45.201
You've got problems because of you,
not your name.

20:47.329 --> 20:51.040
This has got to stop.
Chandler is a great name.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.875
In fact...

20:53.961 --> 20:55.461
Yes.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.839
I'm sorry, I know you really wanted me
to name the baby Joey.

20:59.007 --> 21:03.261
But... So I'm gonna name
the baby Chandler.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.265
Really?

21:07.432 --> 21:09.475
Yeah, but you have to
keep the name too.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.019
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.146
- You want to hug it out?
- Yeah.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.566
- Yay, yay. Oh, yay!
- Yay.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.819
Okay, I'm gonna go tell
Frank and Alice right now.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.195
Okay.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.490
- Bye, Pheebs.
- Okay, bye.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.493
- Ha, ha.
- Oh.

21:37.879 --> 21:42.008
Flight 004 is now arriving at Gate 17.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.139
- Nice luggage.
- I was going to say.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.559
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.646
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you too.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.523
Thanks for everything, I had a great time.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.650
Oh, so did I.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.070
No tongue.
