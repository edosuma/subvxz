00:14.390 --> 00:16.190
(Episode 6)

00:22.200 --> 00:23.700
Stop. It's distracting.

00:24.829 --> 00:25.970
I can't believe this.

00:26.599 --> 00:29.900
I just heard that Chief Seo got shot.

00:30.139 --> 00:32.238
- What?
- What is she talking about?

00:32.238 --> 00:33.368
I'm serious.

00:33.369 --> 00:34.478
I went to
the Foreign Intelligence office...

00:34.479 --> 00:36.479
and Mr. Han told me himself.

00:37.009 --> 00:38.409
The person who shot Chief Seo is...

00:39.110 --> 00:40.309
Han Ji Hyuk.

00:40.310 --> 00:42.049
What on earth are you talking about?

00:42.720 --> 00:45.250
I'm being serious!

00:45.590 --> 00:49.259
A security camera caught him,
so he can't prove otherwise.

00:51.759 --> 00:53.189
I don't believe this.

01:04.170 --> 01:05.269
Ji Hyuk.

01:06.509 --> 01:07.579
I...

01:21.820 --> 01:22.919
Ji Hyuk.

01:31.770 --> 01:34.740
We checked the CCTV footage
of the crime scene.

01:50.180 --> 01:51.219
I...

02:36.559 --> 02:38.399
(Assailant: Han Ji Hyuk
Victim: Seo Su Yeon)

02:38.400 --> 02:41.300
(CCTV footage from the incident)

02:45.640 --> 02:48.279
So she has known all along.

02:48.409 --> 02:51.109
Yes, sir. I reported
what you've just seen to her.

02:51.110 --> 02:53.450
But she didn't
do anything about him.

02:54.349 --> 02:55.379
No, sir.

02:55.749 --> 02:57.219
Where is Deputy Commissioner Do?

02:58.020 --> 02:59.589
She's on her way here.

03:01.189 --> 03:04.158
So she knew
Han Ji Hyuk was unstable...

03:04.159 --> 03:06.659
but she's been ignoring it.

03:07.629 --> 03:09.300
There must've been a good reason.

03:11.330 --> 03:13.400
I'm sure she had an obvious reason.

03:15.300 --> 03:18.270
Maybe she was waiting for him
to remember something...

03:18.670 --> 03:20.170
that is favorable for her.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.839
Sir, let me carry on with the case.

03:24.150 --> 03:25.949
I want to close the case myself.

03:25.950 --> 03:27.550
So this was why...

03:28.379 --> 03:31.050
you wanted to have this meeting
without Deputy Commissioner Do.

03:31.650 --> 03:32.689
Yes, sir.

03:33.390 --> 03:34.860
Let him carry on with it, sir.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.629
Director Kang knows Han Ji Hyuk
inside out.

03:41.529 --> 03:43.059
He's the perfect one for the job.

03:50.170 --> 03:51.740
I apologize for being late.

03:58.249 --> 04:00.408
Am I interrupting something?

04:00.409 --> 04:03.950
It's all right.
I've been briefed on the case.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.289
But this is only the beginning, sir.

04:11.189 --> 04:12.588
His motives, how he did it,

04:12.589 --> 04:15.129
and circumstantial evidence
are all unconvincing.

04:15.260 --> 04:17.468
We have to carry out
an investigation ourselves.

04:17.469 --> 04:18.999
What are you talking about?

04:19.399 --> 04:21.369
There's CCTV footage of him doing it.

04:21.869 --> 04:23.039
CCTV?

04:24.140 --> 04:26.510
What are you doing?
You know better than that.

04:27.069 --> 04:29.809
After the incident,
it took less than three hours...

04:29.810 --> 04:31.950
for the police
to secure the footage.

04:32.450 --> 04:34.249
It's unlikely that
someone tampered with it.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.478
Do you really think so?

04:35.479 --> 04:38.719
Then can you explain why
Han Ji Hyuk shot Seo Su Yeon?

04:38.950 --> 04:40.619
You said you knew him well.

04:40.620 --> 04:43.589
He was so unstable that
he was like a ticking time bomb.

04:44.289 --> 04:46.760
But you decided to ignore it.

04:47.260 --> 04:49.400
Ji Hyuk is a victim in that sense.

04:50.130 --> 04:51.500
A victim?

04:52.130 --> 04:54.200
Then why are you here?

04:54.500 --> 04:57.270
You should be
checking on the victim first.

04:57.539 --> 04:58.939
Am I wrong?

04:58.940 --> 05:02.538
Deputy Commissioner Do,
I know you don't want to admit it.

05:02.539 --> 05:05.048
But this isn't something
you can cover up.

05:05.049 --> 05:07.279
The one who wants to cover it up
is not me.

05:10.950 --> 05:12.549
I think it's you.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.589
There is someone behind this.

05:16.719 --> 05:18.358
We have to reinvestigate.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.560
Deputy Commissioner Do,
that is enough.

05:23.630 --> 05:26.229
Why are you standing there?
Bring Han Ji Hyuk in.

05:30.810 --> 05:33.870
I say this for your own good.

05:34.279 --> 05:37.210
Don't try to get
your hands on the case.

06:14.450 --> 06:17.489
(Agent Han Ji Hyuk)

06:34.669 --> 06:35.739
Ji Hyuk.

06:36.870 --> 06:37.870
Let's go.

06:48.349 --> 06:49.880
Stop the car.

06:50.419 --> 06:52.620
(Han Seon Ok Ox Bone Soup)

06:55.520 --> 06:57.320
It reminded me of that time.

07:00.830 --> 07:03.130
When you got back from Libya.

07:04.870 --> 07:06.968
I brought you
a bowl of ox bone soup.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.000
And you just gobbled it.

07:09.339 --> 07:11.640
I had never seen you
eating in a hurry like that.

07:15.039 --> 07:16.539
I'm sorry, Ji Hyuk.

07:17.310 --> 07:21.279
This is all I can do for you.

07:24.219 --> 07:26.120
How is Su Yeon right now?

07:27.190 --> 07:28.989
She's still unconscious.

07:34.599 --> 07:38.500
Su Yeon always said she owed me.

07:39.630 --> 07:42.299
She was so apologetic.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.909
And it troubles my heart.

07:47.109 --> 07:49.210
It feels like
I'm the one who owes her.

07:55.049 --> 07:56.729
Do everything in your power
to endure it...

07:57.650 --> 07:59.089
so that I can endure it for you.

08:00.789 --> 08:01.919
Sir.

08:05.029 --> 08:07.659
Why aren't you asking me anything?

08:12.070 --> 08:14.239
Why aren't you asking me
if I was the one...

08:17.969 --> 08:20.239
who shot Su Yeon?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.719
Eat up. It's getting cold.

08:42.099 --> 08:43.130
One second.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.880
Don't trust anyone.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.620
Don't trust...

09:07.150 --> 09:08.289
Director Kang.

09:22.870 --> 09:24.610
Director Kang, something seems odd.

09:25.270 --> 09:27.510
- What is?
- The car behind us.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.340
Step on it!

10:04.779 --> 10:06.909
- What are you doing? Go after them.
- Yes, sir.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.029
(Youngokgwan)

10:58.799 --> 10:59.970
(Youngokgwan)

11:47.010 --> 11:49.750
Do you really think I shot Su Yeon?

11:52.490 --> 11:53.949
Do you really?

11:56.059 --> 11:57.059
Ji Hyuk.

11:59.590 --> 12:01.500
I can't afford to lose you too.

12:04.230 --> 12:05.429
That's enough.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.939
Come with me.

12:09.140 --> 12:11.510
You won't ask anything
until the very end.

12:26.350 --> 12:27.990
I left one bullet in here.

12:30.919 --> 12:33.630
If you still can't trust me
by the next time we meet,

12:34.630 --> 12:36.630
please shoot my head off with this.

12:54.850 --> 12:55.919
Stop right there.

12:57.350 --> 12:58.390
Han Ji Hyuk!

13:00.049 --> 13:01.090
Stop right there!

13:41.529 --> 13:42.529
Hello?

13:43.159 --> 13:44.499
I'm sorry to call you this late.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.799
But I had to tell you something.

13:46.199 --> 13:47.500
I just heard too.

13:47.840 --> 13:48.900
By any chance,

13:49.500 --> 13:52.010
did you hear
how Ji Hyuk shot Director Kang?

13:55.209 --> 13:56.209
Continue.

13:56.510 --> 13:59.179
He's not in critical condition,
but his shoulder was injured.

14:01.010 --> 14:02.078
It was reported
to the executive director,

14:02.079 --> 14:04.150
and he gave them permission
to shoot him.

14:04.449 --> 14:07.390
I thought you should know, ma'am.

14:08.020 --> 14:09.990
- Chief Ha.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:10.860 --> 14:12.230
What do you think?

14:13.689 --> 14:16.559
Do you really think
Ji Hyuk shot Director Kang?

14:20.929 --> 14:21.939
Well...

14:22.140 --> 14:23.939
Never mind. I just wanted to ask.

14:24.909 --> 14:26.708
And I had a favor to ask.

14:26.709 --> 14:27.880
Yes, please let me know.

14:28.510 --> 14:30.480
Head over to the NFS
as soon as the day breaks...

14:30.840 --> 14:33.250
and see if the results are out
on the requests we made...

14:33.650 --> 14:35.078
through the police
over this incident.

14:35.079 --> 14:36.179
I'll do that.

14:37.179 --> 14:38.220
Yes, ma'am.

14:46.559 --> 14:48.639
(Silent Devotion to Protect
and Bring Glory to Korea)

14:49.600 --> 14:51.500
Will you let this go on?

14:52.370 --> 14:53.400
There's no need...

14:54.329 --> 14:55.470
to be so antsy.

14:56.470 --> 14:58.970
The bigger the trouble gets,
the more interesting it is...

15:00.039 --> 15:01.240
to sit around and watch.

15:03.279 --> 15:06.078
Anyway, we should put an end
to the Jung Ki Sun case soon.

15:06.079 --> 15:09.119
I handed it over
to Chief Park already and...

15:09.120 --> 15:10.949
That's not what I meant.

15:11.220 --> 15:13.020
Why don't we just cover it up?

15:14.490 --> 15:15.860
Let Jung Ki Sun go...

15:16.220 --> 15:18.360
and destroy all related documents.

15:19.529 --> 15:20.969
Think about
what happened to Ji Hyuk.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.059
This isn't the time
for us to come forward.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.399
And lawyers for a Democratic Party
have already noticed something.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.600
We can't do that, sir.

15:27.770 --> 15:28.999
We worked so hard on...

15:29.000 --> 15:31.340
This isn't the time
to nitpick over such things.

15:31.709 --> 15:33.640
This is the time
to lie as low as we can.

15:37.409 --> 15:38.510
- Here.
- Okay.

15:42.449 --> 15:43.720
Where have you been?

15:43.850 --> 15:45.448
Come over and join us.

15:45.449 --> 15:46.619
What are you up to?

15:46.620 --> 15:49.620
The higher-ups told us to destroy
all documents on Jung Ki Sun.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.489
We'll bring the documents together
and shred them.

15:51.490 --> 15:53.359
And make sure
you delete all related files.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.558
Wait, why?

15:54.559 --> 15:57.299
What do you think?
They're about to close the case.

15:58.730 --> 16:01.068
Right. Rumors say...

16:01.069 --> 16:03.139
they'll let Reporter Jung go.

16:03.140 --> 16:05.669
The same ones who hassled us
to have her arrested.

16:06.039 --> 16:09.209
But we have clear evidence of her
on CCTV at the immigration control.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.140
Why are they
suddenly letting her go?

16:11.350 --> 16:12.449
How would we know?

16:12.709 --> 16:14.579
I'm sure they're onto something.

16:18.090 --> 16:19.150
(Personal Information)

16:56.919 --> 16:57.919
Sir.

16:58.890 --> 16:59.990
Let's go somewhere quiet.

18:22.179 --> 18:23.239
Thank you.

18:26.909 --> 18:29.449
(Pharmacy)

18:43.030 --> 18:44.259
What are you doing?

18:44.600 --> 18:46.100
Who are you?

18:47.030 --> 18:48.269
Elaborate, please.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.640
Over there.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.070
Explain to me
what that room is about.

18:54.939 --> 18:56.610
Why should I?

18:57.310 --> 19:00.780
I heard what happened to Chief Seo.

19:02.219 --> 19:04.949
You don't deserve an explanation
from me right now.

19:06.650 --> 19:07.919
I deserve an explanation.

19:09.419 --> 19:10.989
Just answer my question now.

19:11.060 --> 19:12.090
Sir.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.189
Answer me.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.370
My dad.

19:28.439 --> 19:30.140
My dad was an agent too...

19:31.880 --> 19:33.150
just like us.

19:34.979 --> 19:37.679
He went missing on the day
of my middle school graduation.

19:40.519 --> 19:41.989
Just like you.

19:43.790 --> 19:46.189
You and my dad went through
almost identical incidents.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.159
My dad went missing
in Shenyang too...

19:50.229 --> 19:51.769
during his mission.

19:53.300 --> 19:56.100
I filed official requests
dozens of times.

19:56.870 --> 19:58.139
But I only received...

19:58.140 --> 20:00.669
the exact same letter
in response every single time.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.340
So I decided...

20:04.179 --> 20:05.850
that I would join the agency.

20:06.209 --> 20:08.550
Was that why
you wanted to get close to me?

20:10.979 --> 20:12.150
Yes. Right.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.448
I was trying to gather...

20:14.449 --> 20:16.329
as much information
as I could on my dad's case.

20:17.459 --> 20:20.830
And when I realized that
my method had its limit,

20:22.459 --> 20:24.130
you showed up.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.169
So did you find out anything?

20:28.269 --> 20:30.969
No. Not yet.

20:32.340 --> 20:33.370
Sir.

20:34.310 --> 20:35.810
It's my turn now.

20:38.179 --> 20:39.749
It's about Chief Seo.

20:41.749 --> 20:43.080
You didn't...

20:45.219 --> 20:46.390
shoot her, right?

20:47.949 --> 20:50.560
Why aren't you asking me anything?

20:51.219 --> 20:53.330
Why aren't you asking me
if I was the one...

20:53.590 --> 20:55.800
who shot Su Yeon?

20:59.530 --> 21:01.739
Why are you asking me that?

21:04.140 --> 21:05.340
Didn't you hear me?

21:05.509 --> 21:08.640
The security camera caught me
shooting Su Yeon.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.509
I already heard about that.

21:11.239 --> 21:12.580
But...

21:14.009 --> 21:15.850
I'm asking you that.

21:23.159 --> 21:24.290
Gosh.

21:25.860 --> 21:27.659
I don't know.

21:30.929 --> 21:33.229
Everything is vague
like I'm in the fog.

21:34.130 --> 21:36.100
I'm not sure which side...

21:37.040 --> 21:38.669
is the real me.

21:38.870 --> 21:40.810
Don't you remember anything?

21:41.269 --> 21:42.780
Come on, think.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.650
I think I saw someone
at the shooting.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.189
Are you sure?

21:56.519 --> 21:59.360
That's good.
Once we find that person,

22:00.390 --> 22:02.130
we'll be able to find more.

22:02.630 --> 22:03.630
Okay.

22:14.469 --> 22:17.479
Sir. Why don't you lie down for now?

22:22.880 --> 22:24.350
Hang in there a little bit more.

22:24.850 --> 22:26.689
It'll be harder
if you lose consciousness.

22:37.699 --> 22:39.729
What on earth happened to you?

22:41.229 --> 22:42.669
How did this happen?

22:46.570 --> 22:47.610
Sir?

23:40.959 --> 23:43.459
Su Yeon, I still remember...

23:46.669 --> 23:48.330
the promise I made before.

24:53.630 --> 24:54.699
Ma'am.

24:55.540 --> 24:56.639
Take a look at this.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.339
(Analysis on Chemical Reaction
from Bullets and Rifling Marks)

24:58.340 --> 25:01.069
Right after the incident,
they didn't find any gunshot residue...

25:01.070 --> 25:02.939
from Ji Hyuk's hands and clothes.

25:03.179 --> 25:05.908
And based on the analysis
of the rifling marks on the bullet,

25:05.909 --> 25:07.880
they don't match with Ji Hyuk's gun.

25:08.179 --> 25:09.319
In their opinion,

25:09.320 --> 25:11.780
it's likely to be a private gun
that was bought illegally.

25:12.290 --> 25:14.730
(Analysis on Chemical Reaction
from Bullets and Rifling Marks)

25:15.590 --> 25:17.089
Who else knows about this?

25:17.090 --> 25:19.459
I intercepted it
before the police got this report.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.929
- Chief Ha.
- Yes.

25:25.159 --> 25:27.630
I need you to stall time,
so no one finds this out.

25:30.469 --> 25:33.508
Ma'am. I'm not sure
what your plan is.

25:33.509 --> 25:36.938
But Director Kang is practically
running the entire department.

25:36.939 --> 25:39.379
We need to release evidence
that can clear his name.

25:39.380 --> 25:41.380
- So we can put a stop to...
- No. Not yet.

25:41.580 --> 25:43.179
We don't have to hurry.

25:43.749 --> 25:46.390
Director Kang and Ji Hyuk
haven't even started yet.

25:46.519 --> 25:48.688
So you're just going to watch?

25:48.689 --> 25:51.219
Let's wait until one of them
waves the white flag.

25:51.519 --> 25:53.090
It will be our turn soon.

26:11.739 --> 26:12.850
Ji Hyuk.

26:32.769 --> 26:35.669
I'll check all the security cameras
around where the shooting happened.

26:36.169 --> 26:38.739
Can I take a look
at the security footage here?

26:49.150 --> 26:52.189
No. Check the path
without the security cameras first.

26:52.989 --> 26:55.820
And get the security cameras
around that path.

26:55.890 --> 26:57.120
And send that to me.

27:27.719 --> 27:28.860
Hello.

27:30.790 --> 27:31.820
Hey.

27:34.759 --> 27:35.959
Thank you.

27:36.259 --> 27:37.699
You seem busy these days.

27:38.300 --> 27:40.630
- I had to work outside the office.
- Really?

27:41.600 --> 27:42.669
When did you see Ji Hyuk?

27:43.570 --> 27:45.340
- Sorry?
- Didn't you hear me?

27:45.709 --> 27:47.169
When did you see him?

27:47.769 --> 27:49.978
It's been four days
since I last saw him.

27:49.979 --> 27:52.550
- And after the incident?
- No, sir.

27:53.509 --> 27:56.650
Did anyone else come to you
other than me?

27:57.080 --> 27:58.650
What do you mean?

27:59.350 --> 28:00.390
I'm talking about...

28:00.590 --> 28:02.459
Deputy Commissioner Do
and Director Kang.

28:02.919 --> 28:05.689
Are you interrogating me?

28:05.860 --> 28:06.860
Interrogate you?

28:11.130 --> 28:13.030
No. I'm trying to help you.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.810
Listen up.

28:20.669 --> 28:22.508
I'm sure you know how things are
at our agency these days.

28:22.509 --> 28:25.679
If you somehow get mixed up with him,
you'll be destroyed. Got it?

28:26.550 --> 28:28.050
So...

28:28.249 --> 28:31.050
If you happened to have been
in touch with him already,

28:31.219 --> 28:32.688
or if you learn something about him,

28:32.689 --> 28:35.320
don't go elsewhere
and come straight to me instead.

28:35.519 --> 28:36.560
Do you understand?

28:37.689 --> 28:39.030
Yes, sir.

28:53.110 --> 28:54.310
- Hyo Eun.
- Yes?

28:54.640 --> 28:55.709
What is this?

28:55.880 --> 28:57.208
(National Intelligence Service)

28:57.209 --> 28:58.280
What is that?

29:00.310 --> 29:01.550
Never mind.

29:08.489 --> 29:11.360
This is an internal project number.

29:12.229 --> 29:15.499
(National Intelligence Service)

29:17.060 --> 29:18.360
(Deep Fake Technology Report)

29:19.669 --> 29:21.469
(Deep Fake Technology Report)

29:26.709 --> 29:27.709
Sir.

29:27.909 --> 29:29.810
I found the man I saw.

29:30.509 --> 29:31.579
Did you really?

29:31.580 --> 29:33.248
Yes. Now everything's clear.

29:33.249 --> 29:34.729
I just have to find
Su Yeon's shooter.

29:35.550 --> 29:38.080
Send me his photo. I'll run his ID.

29:38.519 --> 29:41.090
The security footage
they found you in.

29:42.419 --> 29:44.519
I think I know where that came from.

29:46.130 --> 29:48.059
I'll give you the details in person,

29:48.060 --> 29:51.330
but the NIS once worked on
a project called Deep Fake.

29:52.169 --> 29:53.699
- "Deep Fake"?
- Yes.

29:54.199 --> 29:55.669
Put simply,

29:56.469 --> 29:58.369
they use AI like deep learning...

29:58.370 --> 30:00.640
to put someone else's face
onto a video.

30:00.939 --> 30:02.840
It's likely
that technology was used.

30:03.110 --> 30:04.409
How did you figure that out?

30:04.580 --> 30:07.110
That's what I think
is a bit strange.

30:08.380 --> 30:11.280
Someone left
the project number on my desk.

30:15.449 --> 30:16.489
Are you listening?

30:17.189 --> 30:19.360
Someone went into your office...

30:20.530 --> 30:22.159
and left a lead?

30:23.159 --> 30:24.199
Yes.

30:25.969 --> 30:27.070
Okay.

30:27.499 --> 30:30.269
I'll send the photo.
Call me when you have his ID.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.009
We worked on him all night,
but he won't talk.

30:42.350 --> 30:44.519
Even the boys
are getting sick of it.

31:26.030 --> 31:27.090
Your boss.

31:27.790 --> 31:29.330
You knew he entered Korea.

31:30.999 --> 31:32.969
I heard this happened
when the boat exploded.

31:33.530 --> 31:34.830
Wasn't it him...

31:37.169 --> 31:38.300
who sent the boat?

31:43.179 --> 31:44.880
You're looking for him?

31:47.449 --> 31:50.650
Pretty soon,
I'll get to see you hang...

31:50.979 --> 31:53.590
in public while you're still alive.

31:56.689 --> 31:57.790
If you think about it,

31:58.290 --> 31:59.729
pain is nothing, really.

32:02.259 --> 32:04.199
It passes soon if you bear with it.

32:06.669 --> 32:09.870
So I prefer to cause despair
rather than pain or suffering.

32:12.909 --> 32:14.739
I know very well what to cut...

32:15.269 --> 32:17.279
that doesn't cause too much pain,

32:17.280 --> 32:19.880
but leave you in diapers
for the rest of your life.

32:20.110 --> 32:22.179
Do you think you can make me talk?

32:23.479 --> 32:25.478
Why don't you just kill me?

32:25.479 --> 32:27.350
Kill me already!

32:33.189 --> 32:36.060
Soon, you'll realize that living
is worse than purgatory.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.070
What real despair is...

32:43.070 --> 32:44.169
I will show you.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.529
I looked him up.
He's called Jeon Eung Sik.

33:06.530 --> 33:08.330
He defected from North Korea
six years ago.

33:09.130 --> 33:12.370
He served in the Eighth Special Forces
and left a sergeant major.

33:13.070 --> 33:15.870
But he doesn't have
a registered address.

33:16.140 --> 33:17.999
His previous address was expunged.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.110
A cousin he defected with
has a restaurant in Incheon.

33:22.269 --> 33:23.979
I'll send you that address anyway.

34:04.679 --> 34:05.749
Who is it?

34:06.320 --> 34:07.620
Who gave the order?

34:08.748 --> 34:09.889
I'm done with you.

34:34.708 --> 34:37.150
Chang Chun Woo fabricated
Jung Ki Sun's...

34:37.478 --> 34:38.679
exit and entry records. Right?

34:39.050 --> 34:41.889
You can't mention his name
this casually.

34:47.829 --> 34:48.989
How did it go?

34:50.159 --> 34:51.228
I found him.

34:51.829 --> 34:52.869
Did you really?

34:56.099 --> 34:58.999
Sir. Did something go wrong?

34:59.240 --> 35:02.340
He killed himself by biting into
a potassium cyanide capsule.

35:02.439 --> 35:03.479
What?

35:05.039 --> 35:07.079
Take a look. It's his phone.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.450
Someone sent him a photo.

35:11.950 --> 35:13.518
What is he doing with this photo?

35:13.519 --> 35:15.619
I think Jung Ki Sun
was the next target.

35:16.389 --> 35:17.989
Then the sender...

35:17.990 --> 35:19.058
(JCW, last online at 12:24 p.m.)

35:19.059 --> 35:20.389
"JCW"?

35:20.630 --> 35:21.630
Chang Chun Woo.

35:23.229 --> 35:25.499
Or someone related
to Chang Chun Woo.

35:26.169 --> 35:28.369
Then the person
behind Chief Seo's shooting...

35:28.800 --> 35:30.668
could be Chang Chun Woo.

35:30.669 --> 35:31.669
Possibly.

35:37.079 --> 35:39.348
Not long ago, I heard rumors
that our domestic team...

35:39.349 --> 35:41.479
might release Jung Ki Sun.

35:42.820 --> 35:44.279
Is that what they're after?

35:44.280 --> 35:46.289
There's definitely a leak.

35:46.990 --> 35:49.419
Someone connected
very closely with us.

35:50.260 --> 35:52.760
It's exactly what they did
to her cousin.

35:54.430 --> 35:55.689
What is this about?

35:55.930 --> 35:58.459
Why do they want Jung Ki Sun dead?

35:58.959 --> 36:02.499
There's something they must hide
at the risk of killing her.

36:03.200 --> 36:07.269
How about asking around
at the newspaper she worked for?

36:07.570 --> 36:09.579
We could get something
from her colleagues.

36:10.510 --> 36:12.340
Yes. You do that.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.348
Okay.

36:14.349 --> 36:16.248
(Daekook Ilbo)

36:16.249 --> 36:17.320
You didn't know?

36:17.950 --> 36:21.220
Ms. Jung wrote
a lot of stories on North Korea.

36:21.550 --> 36:24.360
I believe your people put pressure
on the news desk.

36:24.559 --> 36:26.130
Oh, did they?

36:27.160 --> 36:30.098
Did you notice anything unusual...

36:30.099 --> 36:32.499
or special before she resigned?

36:32.869 --> 36:35.070
I think she was working on
an in-depth report.

36:35.800 --> 36:39.168
I heard something about her
meeting North Korean defectors...

36:39.169 --> 36:40.910
because of that project.

36:41.110 --> 36:44.039
Do you know
what it was about exactly?

36:44.380 --> 36:45.510
No.

36:46.680 --> 36:49.478
Until something goes to print,

36:49.479 --> 36:51.150
even we are wary of each other.

36:52.150 --> 36:53.219
I see.

36:53.220 --> 36:55.389
You work with Su Yeon, right?

36:55.550 --> 36:57.990
Do you know Chief Seo?

36:58.320 --> 37:00.090
We joined the company
at the same time.

37:00.689 --> 37:02.799
I'm scheduled
to meet her this evening.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.229
You're meeting her today?

37:05.430 --> 37:06.430
Yes.

37:06.769 --> 37:08.970
She called me out of the blue
a few days ago.

37:11.070 --> 37:12.670
You will find out the answer
soon enough.

37:13.340 --> 37:14.510
Given what happened,

37:16.280 --> 37:17.979
I won't just sit back and watch.

37:33.959 --> 37:36.499
Do you remember that
Deep Fake project I told you about?

37:37.229 --> 37:40.200
It was put to a halt
a few months ago.

37:41.499 --> 37:44.570
So I began to look up
their whereabouts...

37:44.900 --> 37:46.808
and found a chief researcher...

37:46.809 --> 37:49.039
named Bae Jong Soo
to be rather suspicious.

37:49.209 --> 37:51.279
Bae Jong Soo?
What was suspicious about him?

37:51.280 --> 37:54.610
Until recently, he was listed
as an executive of Keiotech.

37:55.249 --> 37:56.550
But here's the problem.

37:56.780 --> 37:59.519
That company is
nothing but a paper company.

38:00.849 --> 38:03.559
Find more information
on Bae Jong Soo and send it to me.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.760
I'll do that right away.

38:06.660 --> 38:10.030
He might be involved
with Chang Chun Woo in a way.

38:15.970 --> 38:17.240
Who is it?

38:17.570 --> 38:18.740
Delivery.

38:19.510 --> 38:21.139
Leave it there and go.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.780
I told you to leave it there and go.

38:30.680 --> 38:31.780
Who are you?

38:41.189 --> 38:43.599
After the project
with the NIS fell through,

38:43.900 --> 38:45.829
they called me right away.

38:46.269 --> 38:47.829
It was as if he had been waiting.

38:48.869 --> 38:50.400
Who was he?

38:50.970 --> 38:52.910
I only called him Mr. Kim.

38:53.139 --> 38:54.570
(Keiotech, Chief Kim Han Soo)

38:55.979 --> 38:59.110
Mr. Bae, just consider this
in simple terms.

39:00.180 --> 39:01.808
It doesn't matter
if you do it in there or out here.

39:01.809 --> 39:04.150
You're doing everything
for your country's sake.

39:05.019 --> 39:07.149
But we'd like to offer you...

39:07.150 --> 39:09.419
higher salary and bonuses
compared to your old job.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.660
He said I'd be working
for the country anyway.

39:11.860 --> 39:15.160
And he offered me
a higher salary and benefits.

39:15.959 --> 39:17.999
I went to their office in Gangnam...

39:18.200 --> 39:20.030
and continued
to work on the project.

39:21.669 --> 39:23.539
What did you do there?

39:24.470 --> 39:27.369
I created this tool that can tamper
with videos by using Deep Fake.

39:28.369 --> 39:29.639
Later on,

39:30.240 --> 39:32.709
I even had
to fabricate videos myself.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.880
What kind of videos?

39:35.309 --> 39:39.220
They were usually of videos
taken by phones or CCTVs.

39:39.450 --> 39:42.789
I just did as Mr. Kim said,
whatever he brought.

39:47.030 --> 39:48.260
Mr. Bae.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.299
When you see videos
fabricated with that tool you made,

39:53.300 --> 39:54.630
can you tell that it was faked?

39:55.570 --> 39:56.768
I used to be able to tell...

39:56.769 --> 39:59.740
by how people blinked
and the angles of light.

40:00.070 --> 40:01.510
But the tool I made...

40:01.669 --> 40:03.578
uses the discriminator algorithms...

40:03.579 --> 40:06.010
to make the copy infinitely similar
to the original.

40:06.309 --> 40:08.950
It's practically impossible.

40:14.419 --> 40:16.789
Is there a way to prove
the video was fabricated?

40:17.160 --> 40:18.189
There isn't.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.289
You'll have to find the original.

40:26.769 --> 40:29.169
(Yoo Je Yi)

40:29.900 --> 40:32.099
Jung Ki Sun was writing an article?

40:32.169 --> 40:34.269
I'm not sure
exactly what it was about,

40:34.410 --> 40:36.680
but she had been interviewing
North Korean defectors.

40:44.780 --> 40:47.419
About that article
Jung Ki Sun had been preparing.

40:48.749 --> 40:50.990
It might help us
get to the bottom of this case.

40:52.220 --> 40:54.459
And Chang Chun Woo must be
after Jung Ki Sun...

40:54.789 --> 40:56.329
because of that, right?

40:56.930 --> 40:59.159
And her colleague...

40:59.160 --> 41:01.599
told me that Chief Seo...

41:02.070 --> 41:03.399
had been in trouble...

41:03.400 --> 41:05.939
before she came over
to work with us.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.368
What happened?

41:08.369 --> 41:11.180
Bad rumors began to spread
in her office...

41:11.740 --> 41:14.349
that she's having an affair
with one of the higher-ups.

41:15.010 --> 41:16.078
And?

41:16.079 --> 41:19.618
One of our intelligence agents
in charge of that newspaper...

41:19.619 --> 41:21.789
let her meet
with Director Kang Pil Ho.

41:22.590 --> 41:24.188
I heard she got to work here...

41:24.189 --> 41:26.689
because Director Kang helped her.

41:28.860 --> 41:30.700
Before I dated Kyung Seok,

41:31.599 --> 41:33.729
there was someone I was
really indebted to.

41:34.269 --> 41:35.669
And that person...

41:37.700 --> 41:39.539
made a request...

41:40.769 --> 41:42.340
that I couldn't refuse.

41:42.539 --> 41:46.579
Su Yeon always said she owed me.

41:46.680 --> 41:48.950
She was so apologetic.

41:49.349 --> 41:51.418
I should've stopped her
when she said...

41:51.419 --> 41:53.550
she wanted to go there to work under
some director.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.619
Chief Seo...

41:56.959 --> 42:00.090
had an appointment
with that reporter's colleague.

42:00.289 --> 42:02.359
So? Did they already meet?

42:02.360 --> 42:04.900
They were to meet today of all days.

42:05.530 --> 42:07.329
Doesn't everything seem odd?

42:08.470 --> 42:10.768
Don't you think she tried
to disclose an important truth...

42:10.769 --> 42:12.669
to the media?

42:17.680 --> 42:18.939
What now?

42:19.809 --> 42:21.609
If Jung Ki Sun gets released
like this,

42:21.610 --> 42:24.320
she'll end up becoming
Chang Chun Woo's target.

42:25.550 --> 42:27.819
We'll have to grab her first.

42:27.820 --> 42:28.950
But how?

42:29.450 --> 42:31.160
There's a way.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.959
(Han Ji Hyuk)

42:46.169 --> 42:47.610
(Han Ji Hyuk)

42:55.910 --> 42:57.450
(Locate Device: Han Ji Hyuk)

42:59.220 --> 43:01.249
Hey, Ji Hyuk. It's me.

43:02.450 --> 43:03.810
I've been waiting for you to call.

43:03.959 --> 43:05.090
What took you so long?

43:05.720 --> 43:08.030
Something unexpected happened.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.030
I understand.

43:10.530 --> 43:12.400
I'm sure you're
falsely accused in some way.

43:12.660 --> 43:15.369
- Why don't we meet up and...
- Sir.

43:16.269 --> 43:18.169
May I ask you for a favor,

43:19.400 --> 43:21.539
not as your junior,
but as your colleague?

43:22.470 --> 43:23.910
Sure, go ahead.

43:24.380 --> 43:27.079
Let me meet with Jung Ki Sun.

43:32.320 --> 43:35.149
Can you tell me the reason?

43:35.150 --> 43:37.618
I'm sorry,
but I can't tell you that.

43:37.619 --> 43:39.589
However, if you make that happen,

43:39.590 --> 43:41.630
I'll come and see you right away.

43:42.630 --> 43:43.760
Is that all?

43:45.900 --> 43:48.200
Tomorrow at 5 p.m.,
Eoullim Square at DOP.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.469
I only want to see
Jung Ki Sun there.

43:50.470 --> 43:51.669
If...

43:52.139 --> 43:55.110
I see even one agent,
I'll consider this deal broken.

43:55.309 --> 43:57.110
I'll have to discuss this
with my superiors...

44:11.220 --> 44:14.489
Right here. Here, and here.

44:14.490 --> 44:17.829
We'll locate snipers
in these eight spots.

44:19.329 --> 44:21.799
And we'll have backup
around the square...

44:21.800 --> 44:23.199
to cut off his escape routes.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.800
You're going to place snipers
in the square? That's insane.

44:25.869 --> 44:28.768
There are too many people.
This is too risky.

44:28.769 --> 44:30.039
I agree.

44:30.240 --> 44:33.078
Do we have to take things so far
just to deal with one person?

44:33.079 --> 44:35.050
Do we have to take things this far?

44:35.979 --> 44:37.720
Get a grip, everyone.

44:38.050 --> 44:39.519
We're up against Han Ji Hyuk.

44:39.650 --> 44:41.089
Did you forget what he's like...

44:41.090 --> 44:42.810
because you were busy
working in the office?

44:43.189 --> 44:44.389
It all sounds great,

44:45.220 --> 44:47.090
but we're missing
the most important aspect.

44:49.130 --> 44:50.900
What's he after?

44:51.559 --> 44:55.229
Why is he taking this big risk
just to see Jung Ki Sun?

44:56.369 --> 44:58.099
We'll ask him...

44:58.939 --> 45:00.910
after we catch him.

45:24.400 --> 45:25.729
I just heard.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.130
Those above gave you approval.

45:28.829 --> 45:29.900
Yes, ma'am.

45:30.869 --> 45:33.309
I still wasn't sure
even after thinking this through.

45:33.610 --> 45:36.168
Will we be celebrating or mourning?

45:36.169 --> 45:37.479
No matter what we do,

45:37.809 --> 45:40.779
I'm sure it won't be anything
you wanted to happen.

45:40.780 --> 45:43.150
You shouldn't get too confident.

45:43.619 --> 45:45.220
You know him too.

45:45.450 --> 45:48.749
He's a man who can turn the tables
no matter what's up against.

45:49.150 --> 45:51.260
I'll take your advice to my heart.

45:53.930 --> 45:55.389
Is your shoulder all right?

45:57.630 --> 45:59.559
It's not bothering me too much.

46:01.430 --> 46:02.530
What a relief.

46:14.209 --> 46:15.410
Where are you going?

46:15.610 --> 46:17.949
Where have you been?
You won't even pick up your phone.

46:17.950 --> 46:19.990
- I...
- Our team was called.

46:20.550 --> 46:21.820
By whom?

46:22.820 --> 46:25.518
Well, due to an internal affair...

46:25.519 --> 46:27.930
made the position
of your team a little awkward,

46:28.130 --> 46:30.029
but I'm sure...

46:30.030 --> 46:32.130
you're all aware
that you're a part of our bureau.

46:32.959 --> 46:36.229
Also, I shared the details
of the operation with Chief Park.

46:36.499 --> 46:38.669
He'll split up the tasks for you.

46:39.200 --> 46:40.439
Please make it happen.

46:40.709 --> 46:42.139
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

46:42.740 --> 46:44.110
Go out and do some good work.

46:44.539 --> 46:46.650
Sir, may I have
this cherry-flavored candy?

46:47.209 --> 46:48.309
Take them.

46:49.680 --> 46:50.780
Thank you.

46:52.780 --> 46:54.689
Was your name Yoo Je Yi?

46:55.220 --> 46:56.220
Yes, sir.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.919
May I speak to you for a moment?

47:01.160 --> 47:02.229
Yes, sir.

47:02.389 --> 47:04.700
You're Ji Hyuk's partner, right?

47:05.459 --> 47:06.668
Yes, sir.

47:06.669 --> 47:09.070
How long has it been
since you worked with him?

47:09.499 --> 47:11.769
About two months, sir.

47:14.209 --> 47:17.180
Since you worked with him,

47:17.510 --> 47:20.510
I was hoping you'd help us out
in the situation room.

47:20.579 --> 47:22.910
Sorry? Me?

47:23.720 --> 47:26.349
Why not? Is there a problem?

47:26.749 --> 47:27.820
No, sir.

47:28.050 --> 47:29.349
I'll be there.

47:48.089 --> 47:49.890
This is Alpha. Nothing unusual.

47:59.330 --> 48:01.069
This is Beta. Nothing unusual.

48:03.069 --> 48:04.069
Listen up.

48:04.469 --> 48:08.480
He will create a distraction
and try to shake us up.

48:08.710 --> 48:09.879
Let me repeat.

48:10.009 --> 48:11.548
Whatever happens,

48:11.549 --> 48:13.620
you must stay calm
and keep your position.

48:16.219 --> 48:17.790
(Central Management Center)

48:37.439 --> 48:38.439
Sir.

48:38.669 --> 48:41.338
Communication with Agent 14 outside
the northern part of the square...

48:41.339 --> 48:42.439
has been lost.

48:44.310 --> 48:45.609
He's on the move.

48:50.850 --> 48:52.519
This is Beta. At our 12.

48:52.520 --> 48:54.418
I found a guy who fits
Skylark's descriptions.

48:54.419 --> 48:55.460
Please confirm.

49:04.270 --> 49:06.939
Alpha, confirm his identity.

49:07.200 --> 49:08.699
This is Alpha. I'm not certain,

49:08.700 --> 49:10.609
but it's highly likely
that he's Skylark.

49:10.839 --> 49:12.939
He's heading to the center
toward Lily.

49:17.950 --> 49:19.080
The security cameras.

49:19.350 --> 49:21.870
They'll try to watch my every move
through the security cameras.

49:21.950 --> 49:24.290
Then how will we approach
Jung Ki Sun?

49:24.589 --> 49:26.549
I talked to Bae Jong Soo earlier.

49:26.790 --> 49:27.959
As long as he can break into...

49:27.960 --> 49:29.560
the network
for public security cameras,

49:29.919 --> 49:33.028
he said he'd be able to change people
in the footage in real time.

49:33.029 --> 49:35.160
He'll use that project called Deep Fake.

49:36.500 --> 49:39.169
His height and gait match
Han Ji Hyuk's.

49:41.140 --> 49:43.468
Why don't we dispatch
the team on standby and confirm?

49:43.469 --> 49:44.540
No.

49:44.839 --> 49:45.869
If we make a move now,

49:45.870 --> 49:47.839
it will ruin
our entire surveillance network.

49:49.080 --> 49:50.910
And that might be what he's after.

50:03.189 --> 50:05.960
And what's the other safety net?

50:06.689 --> 50:07.700
Guilt.

50:09.460 --> 50:12.169
But I'm not sure if he has
any sense of guilt left in him.

50:18.210 --> 50:19.839
Alpha. Beta. Can you hear me?

50:20.939 --> 50:22.839
Aim at the target now.

50:26.149 --> 50:28.080
This is Alpha. Target in sight.

50:30.719 --> 50:32.589
This is Beta. Target in sight.

51:19.370 --> 51:20.399
Standby.

51:20.700 --> 51:22.669
This is Alpha.
I confirmed Skylark's identity.

51:23.839 --> 51:25.008
What are you talking about?

51:25.009 --> 51:26.980
Alpha. Check again.

51:27.439 --> 51:29.040
This is Alpha. No changes.

51:29.239 --> 51:30.310
Waiting for your command.

51:31.279 --> 51:33.049
This is Beta.
I confirmed Skylark's identity.

51:33.580 --> 51:35.380
This is Delta.
I confirmed Skylark's identity.

51:52.700 --> 51:56.640
Place the samples of her front face
and her body shape like this.

51:57.040 --> 51:58.640
Then I can swap them.

51:59.739 --> 52:01.459
Now, you have
a completely different person.

52:13.520 --> 52:16.389
Sir. I think someone is hacking
the security camera network...

52:16.390 --> 52:18.129
and planting different images.

52:18.529 --> 52:19.759
That's right.

52:20.259 --> 52:22.600
It makes no sense
that Chief Seo is at the square.

52:22.799 --> 52:25.830
They already confirmed his identity.
Please give your command.

52:38.379 --> 52:39.379
This is Alpha.

52:39.380 --> 52:41.549
Skylark and Lily are running
to my three o'clock fast.

52:41.819 --> 52:42.850
Waiting for your command.

52:44.020 --> 52:45.350
Give you command now, sir.

52:47.759 --> 52:48.759
Sir.

52:51.989 --> 52:53.330
This is Delta. I'm set.

52:57.169 --> 52:58.600
Do it. Now.

52:58.969 --> 53:00.029
Confirmed.

53:04.839 --> 53:06.739
Lark and Lily have escaped
the range of fire.

53:06.980 --> 53:09.609
Let me repeat.
I don't have eyes on the target.

53:13.950 --> 53:15.249
Do we have anyone in the basement?

53:15.250 --> 53:16.319
Unit Eight is on standby.

53:17.520 --> 53:18.850
Dispatch them now.

53:20.149 --> 53:21.749
Tell them
I give them permission to fire.

54:52.379 --> 54:53.410
What's this about?

54:54.180 --> 54:56.750
Why did you want to see me
at the expense of your own life?

54:58.390 --> 55:00.560
Some people are after you.

55:02.120 --> 55:03.189
You mean the people...

55:03.989 --> 55:05.529
that killed my cousin?

55:06.989 --> 55:08.660
Did you already know who they were?

55:10.870 --> 55:12.529
I asked you a question.

55:13.770 --> 55:15.299
Even if I did,

55:15.739 --> 55:18.310
it's up to me
to answer your question.

55:20.239 --> 55:23.279
A year ago in China,
there was an incident...

55:23.779 --> 55:25.009
during my mission.

55:25.950 --> 55:27.980
And all of my colleagues died
from that incident.

55:28.549 --> 55:30.120
I believe the guy who is...

55:32.020 --> 55:34.989
responsible for the incident
is also after you now.

55:35.359 --> 55:37.319
Does that give you enough reason
to answer it now?

55:39.589 --> 55:41.859
Right until you resigned
from Daekook Ilbo,

55:42.200 --> 55:43.920
you were putting together
an article. Right?

55:44.930 --> 55:46.430
What was it about?

55:48.839 --> 55:51.140
Aren't they after you
because of what you know?

55:52.169 --> 55:53.640
You might regret...

55:54.939 --> 55:56.609
finding them out.

55:58.009 --> 55:59.580
I have nothing to lose now.

56:00.009 --> 56:04.750
(Yoon Chang Kyu)

56:10.930 --> 56:12.128
There was a rumor...

56:12.129 --> 56:14.028
that the NIS separately handled
North Korean defectors...

56:14.029 --> 56:15.536
who worked
in the military or the government...

56:15.560 --> 56:18.129
and forced them
to do their dirty work.

56:18.930 --> 56:20.668
And when I followed that lead,

56:20.669 --> 56:22.568
I stumbled upon
a private organization...

56:22.569 --> 56:24.369
that consisted of retired agents
from the NIS.

56:27.009 --> 56:28.109
A private organization?

56:28.779 --> 56:29.839
Sangmuhoe.

56:30.850 --> 56:31.910
That's what it was called.

56:36.180 --> 56:37.290
Sangmuhoe?

56:38.520 --> 56:40.120
And not long after that,

56:40.859 --> 56:42.960
I received a shocking tip-off.

56:43.560 --> 56:45.089
What was the tip-off?

56:46.259 --> 56:49.399
You guys call it Bloody Friday.

56:50.730 --> 56:53.969
A year ago, a list of the agents
leaked in China.

56:55.569 --> 56:56.640
That's right.

56:56.770 --> 56:58.839
The mastermind
behind that incident...

56:59.640 --> 57:02.379
was Sangmuhoe according to my tip.

57:04.950 --> 57:06.180
Are you sure?

57:06.549 --> 57:09.480
Yes. My informant was...

57:09.719 --> 57:12.419
at the scene when the list leaked.

57:17.660 --> 57:19.089
Did you meet with the informant?

57:19.730 --> 57:21.858
We decided to meet up in Shenyang.

57:21.859 --> 57:23.129
So I went over to China.

57:23.870 --> 57:26.600
But all of a sudden,
I couldn't reach my informant.

57:27.939 --> 57:29.469
We didn't get to meet.

57:29.939 --> 57:31.310
When was this?

57:32.009 --> 57:34.410
About six months ago.

57:35.879 --> 57:38.049
It seems he was active
mainly in Shenyang.

57:38.279 --> 57:40.409
I'm sure he's the one
who sent us Jung Ki Sun's...

57:40.410 --> 57:41.850
exit and entry records.

57:42.149 --> 57:45.188
When the list was leaked,
among all the black agents,

57:45.189 --> 57:47.419
he was the only one who survived.

57:52.830 --> 57:53.830
Hello?

57:54.000 --> 57:57.160
It's about the photo
you wanted analyzed.

57:57.500 --> 58:01.040
They broke the code
and found another photo.

58:01.899 --> 58:04.039
I just got it and had a look.

58:04.040 --> 58:06.710
I think you should
have a look first. Hang on.

58:39.439 --> 58:40.878
(If you want to meet Jung Ki Sun,
come to Jung Eun Hee's place, )

58:40.879 --> 58:41.910
(Chang Chun Woo.)

59:37.700 --> 59:38.969
Where's Jung Ki Sun?

59:46.270 --> 59:47.609
She's not here.

59:51.750 --> 59:53.710
That's not what you promised.

59:55.149 --> 59:58.219
This is where you killed her cousin.

59:59.850 --> 01:00:01.759
Please let me live.

01:00:08.899 --> 01:00:10.160
It's sad,

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.430
but the answer is simple.

01:00:13.799 --> 01:00:15.569
The real deal just has to disappear.

01:00:15.939 --> 01:00:17.040
Ms. Jung Eun Hee!

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.669
I found a woman unconscious.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.980
Do you think I came here
without a plan?

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:30.790
I hope...

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.020
you brought the answer.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.560
Soon, Jung Ki Sun
will tell the press...

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.230
that this spy ordeal was fabricated.

01:00:43.129 --> 01:00:44.870
And while she's at it,

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.770
she'll reveal the NIS agent list
that was leaked last year...

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:55.040
involved a group called Sangmuhoe.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.509
Who will believe such nonsense
that no one can prove?

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:03.080
I heard someone gave her a tip-off
after the list was leaked.

01:01:04.319 --> 01:01:06.620
It was from someone
who'd been at the scene.

01:01:06.919 --> 01:01:08.120
So what?

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.790
I found out who tipped her off.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.500
Don't you want to know?

01:01:22.799 --> 01:01:23.939
Chang Chun Woo.

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:26.969
It's you.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.739
You called her.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.219
Too bad. I don't want to listen
any longer.

01:01:39.319 --> 01:01:41.290
You said there was no proof.

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:45.529
How about this?

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:54.028
A few days before
the list was leaked,

01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:56.140
this photo of me and my team
was taken in Shenyang.

01:01:58.870 --> 01:02:00.939
I knew it the moment
I saw the photo.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.439
That it was a site
directly connected to...

01:02:03.779 --> 01:02:05.180
this case.

01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:11.290
You were there.

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:16.160
I'm really disappointed.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.029
What can you prove
with just one photo?

01:02:20.689 --> 01:02:22.560
I'm not trying to prove anything.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.230
I'm trying to cause doubt.

01:02:26.529 --> 01:02:28.640
What if it wasn't me
doing the doubting?

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:33.040
What if it's Sangmuhoe?

01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:35.109
Well?

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.480
Jung Ki Sun will tell the press
that she got a tip from someone...

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.980
who had been on the scene.

01:02:46.489 --> 01:02:47.960
With this photo.

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:53.529
The insider who was at the scene.

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.628
It's only a matter of time
before Sangmuhoe...

01:02:57.629 --> 01:02:59.069
figures out you're the tipster.

01:03:04.509 --> 01:03:06.040
Someone told me that...

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:09.810
there's nothing like suspicion
to make someone feel lonely.

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:12.049
That's enough.

01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:14.379
Why did you
suddenly want to share info?

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.649
Did you get sick of...

01:03:18.419 --> 01:03:19.819
being Sangmuhoe's dog?

01:03:22.359 --> 01:03:23.559
I said that was enough.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.989
That's why you wanted
Jung Ki Sun dead so badly.

01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:29.100
Because she's
the only person who knows...

01:03:29.399 --> 01:03:30.870
you betrayed Sangmuhoe.

01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:32.100
Shut your mouth!

01:03:37.399 --> 01:03:39.540
This won't change anything.

01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:44.140
But I do know of a way...

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:47.819
to stop it from coming out.

01:03:55.359 --> 01:03:56.660
What is it you want?

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.290
The original security footage of me.

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:01.930
That's it?

01:04:03.899 --> 01:04:05.469
And the identity of these people.

01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:07.230
Who are they?

01:04:08.439 --> 01:04:09.899
The person in the middle.

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.810
He has something to do
with Hwang Mo Sool, right?

01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:15.609
Is he...

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.879
Baek Mo Sa?

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:26.219
I don't know anything.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.089
Other than that he used to be
in the NIS.

01:04:35.759 --> 01:04:37.830
I think our deal is done.

01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:39.700
Su Yeon.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.200
Why did you shoot her?

01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:47.568
Shut your mouth
before I rip it apart.

01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:48.609
Why?

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:52.278
Do you feel guilty?

01:04:52.279 --> 01:04:53.979
I did what I could to stop it.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.680
You tried to stop it?
Didn't you just watch?

01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:59.689
Are you that afraid of Sangmuhoe?

01:05:01.989 --> 01:05:03.719
Watch what you say.

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:06.629
Su Yeon...

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:11.930
Su...

01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:19.870
You think what you saw
is all there is.

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:21.810
You're so wrong.

01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:26.109
You just see what you want to see.

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:30.020
Because you don't have the guts
to face the truth.

01:05:30.779 --> 01:05:32.120
What do you mean?

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.719
Don't be too impatient.

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.759
Just because you don't remember
doesn't erase the past.

01:05:39.759 --> 01:05:41.230
If you just wait,

01:05:41.759 --> 01:05:45.029
the past will come back
and rip your neck.

01:05:48.399 --> 01:05:50.299
Don't think this is the end of it.

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:52.040
It's not.

01:06:09.819 --> 01:06:11.689
Why is it so hard to reach you?

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.529
I got the original security footage.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.830
What? Did you really?

01:06:17.299 --> 01:06:19.969
Yes. I'll send it over now.
Go through it and call me back.

01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:21.569
Just a moment.

01:06:23.239 --> 01:06:26.239
I just got a call from a colleague
at the hospital.

01:06:27.009 --> 01:06:28.080
Chief Seo...

01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:31.509
woke up.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:48.899
(Open)

01:06:57.469 --> 01:06:59.710
(Intensive Care Unit)

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:13.580
Freeze! Hands in the air!

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:53.420
(Delete)

01:08:54.889 --> 01:08:56.188
(Delete)

01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:58.109
(Do you wish to delete the file
from the server?)

01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:03.750
(Do you wish to delete the file
from the server?)

01:09:06.929 --> 01:09:07.939
(Yes)

01:09:12.238 --> 01:09:14.069
Where's Su Yeon?

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.010
Su Yeon died...

01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:18.649
a few hours ago.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.910
(The Veil)

01:10:12.099 --> 01:10:14.268
I consider this
as an act of provocation.

01:10:14.269 --> 01:10:15.969
Aren't you sick
of your conspiracy theories?

01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:18.209
I'll take responsibility and resign.

01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:20.568
And why are you giving me this case?

01:10:20.569 --> 01:10:22.438
If they're after you,

01:10:22.439 --> 01:10:24.339
it means
you're that close to the truth.

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:26.749
Could this person be
the head of Sangmuhoe?

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:27.909
Your memories.

01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:29.979
Did you get them back?
