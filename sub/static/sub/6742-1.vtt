32:52.738 --> 32:56.575

COFFEEMAKERS?

32:56.642 --> 33:00.146

HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.380

OF THE RESISTANCE

33:01.447 --> 33:03.182
FOR EAST NEW YORK, MR. WARREN.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.516
WE'VE KNOWN IT FOR A MONTH NOW,

33:04.583 --> 33:06.552
EVER SINCE WE INTERCEPTED
ONE OF THESE.

33:06.618 --> 33:10.356
THIS IS THE SYMBOL
OF YOUR MOVEMENT, IS IT NOT?

33:15.061 --> 33:18.897
WE KNOW WHERE
THAT TRUCK WAS HEADED.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.432
AND WHAT IT WAS CARRYING.

33:20.499 --> 33:24.303
- IF YOU KNOW SO MUCH,
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME, HUH?

33:26.805 --> 33:30.109
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

33:30.176 --> 33:33.412

33:33.479 --> 33:35.247
UHH--UHH--AAH!

[police siren blares]

33:42.888 --> 33:45.291
- OH, FUCK.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.769
[car door opens and closes]

34:00.005 --> 34:01.607
- BLOW-OUT, HUH?

34:01.673 --> 34:04.376
- YEAH, AND NO TOOL KIT.
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.312
- WELL, I GOT ONE
IN THE TRUNK.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.014
LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.816
- THANK YOU,
I APPRECIATE THAT.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.458
- [grunting]

34:19.525 --> 34:21.193
ALL RIGHT,
THAT SHOULD BE GOOD.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.462
PULL SLOWLY UP.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.664
ALL RIGHT, HOLD.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.233
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.867
- OH, THANKS A LOT.

34:28.934 --> 34:32.338
- THERE'S NOT ANOTHER DINER
OPEN FOR ABOUT FIVE HOURS.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.341
WIFE PACKED AN EXTRA SANDWICH
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.576
- OH, YOU DON'T MIND?
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.212
I WILL NEED TO SEE
YOUR TRANSIT PAPERS.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.581
- YEAH, SURE.

34:50.489 --> 34:53.492
- UH, EGG SALAD.
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.894
- THAT'S GREAT.
- THERE WE GO.

34:55.961 --> 34:58.564
OH, IT'S YOUR FIRST LONG HAUL?
- HOW'D YOU KNOW?

34:58.630 --> 35:02.468
- WELL, NOT HAVING A TOOL KIT.
THAT'S A... ROOKIE MISTAKE.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.170
- I GUESS SO.
IT'S MY FIRST TIME

35:04.170 --> 35:06.905
OUT OF NEW YORK, ACTUALLY,
FIRST TIME SEEING THE COUNTRY.

35:06.972 --> 35:09.541
- WELL, HERE IT IS.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.610
- YOU MIND I ASK,
THE TATTOO ON YOUR ARM?

35:11.677 --> 35:12.811
- OH.

35:12.878 --> 35:15.181
A SOLDIER SO FIERCE,
HE'D KILL A ROSE.

35:15.181 --> 35:18.950
- THAT WAS YOU?
- OH, A LONG TIME AGO.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.952
WE LOST THE WAR, DIDN'T WE?

35:21.019 --> 35:23.489
NOW, I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT WE WERE FIGHTING FOR.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.792
[chuckles]
UH, YOUR DAD A VET?

35:26.858 --> 35:28.294
- YEAH.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.829
- MUST BE PROUD,
FINE YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.998
- WE'RE NOT REALLY CLOSE,
BUT ME GETTING THIS JOB

35:33.064 --> 35:36.902
IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO HIM.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.370
WHAT IS THAT?

35:38.437 --> 35:42.208
- OH, THAT'S THE HOSPITAL.
- THE HOSPITAL?

35:42.274 --> 35:46.878
- YEAH, TUESDAYS, THEY BURN
CRIPPLES, THE TERMINALLY ILL.

35:46.945 --> 35:49.415
DRAG ON THE STATE.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.851
THERE YOU GO.
YOU HAVE A SAFE TRIP, SON.

35:52.918 --> 35:56.722
MAKE YOUR OLD MAN PROUD, NOW.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.565
[car door closes]

36:06.632 --> 36:09.235
[engine starts]

36:20.246 --> 36:23.882
[P.A. announcement
in Japanese]

36:37.128 --> 36:39.565
- [gasps]
- CAN I HELP YOU, MISS?

36:39.631 --> 36:43.269
- HEY!
THERE YOU ARE.

36:43.302 --> 36:44.670
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

36:44.736 --> 36:46.838
- I GAVE THAT SATCHEL
TO TRUDY. WHERE IS SHE?

36:46.905 --> 36:48.707
- SHE'S DEAD.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.876
THEY SHOT HER LAST NIGHT
IN THE STREET.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.279
- OH, JESUS.

36:53.279 --> 36:56.114
- YOU THE ONE
WHO GOT HER INTO THIS?

36:56.181 --> 36:58.817
- YES, I SUPPOSE SO.
WHO ARE YOU?

36:58.884 --> 37:02.621
- I'M HER SISTER.

37:02.688 --> 37:05.491
- GIVE ME THE FILM.
- NO, I'M GOING IN HER PLACE.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.393
- THEY'RE EXPECTING TRUDY,
NOT YOU.

37:07.459 --> 37:09.695
- I'LL SAY I'M HER.
- IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.564
- SO WHAT, SHE DIES FOR NOTHING?
- NOT NOTHING.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.600
SHE DIED DOING THE RIGHT THING.
- THE RIGHT THING?

37:14.666 --> 37:18.103
YOU GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING.

37:18.169 --> 37:21.172
WHAT DO I DO
WHEN I GET THERE?

37:21.307 --> 37:23.542
TELL ME.

37:25.877 --> 37:29.114
- UH, YOU WAIT.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.883
- I WAIT?
- THEY WILL COME TO YOU

37:31.950 --> 37:33.319
IF IT IS SAFE.

37:33.319 --> 37:35.754
- THIS FILM,
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

37:35.821 --> 37:39.691
- YOU WANT TO HELP?
DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.715
[sonic boom,
jet engines roar]

38:38.550 --> 38:40.486
[bus engine rumbles]

39:20.692 --> 39:23.862
- AH, MR. BAYNES,
NOBUSUKE TAGOMI.

39:23.929 --> 39:27.265
- MR. TAGOMI, VERY KIND OF YOU
TO MEET ME IN PERSON.

39:27.332 --> 39:28.700
- TRADE RELATIONS WITH SWEDEN

39:28.767 --> 39:30.436
IS VERY IMPORTANT
TO THE PACIFIC STATES.

39:30.436 --> 39:33.972
MY ASSOCIATE, MR. KOTOMICHI,
WILL SEE TO YOUR BAGGAGE.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.007
- THANK YOU.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.275
- AND HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT?

39:37.342 --> 39:39.978
- NEW YORK TO SAN FRANCISCO
IN UNDER TWO HOURS.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.914
- [chuckles]
GERMAN TECHNOLOGY.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.684
WE JAPANESE CANNOT
HOPE TO COMPETE.

39:45.751 --> 39:49.721
- TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THE MEASURE
OF A GREAT CIVILIZATION.

40:02.468 --> 40:04.603
- FORGIVE ME, COLONEL.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.005
I MUST CONFIRM YOUR IDENTITY.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.139
- OF COURSE.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.211
I'M TOLD SWEDEN
IS A LOVELY COUNTRY,

40:13.278 --> 40:15.013
BUT I NEVER VISITED.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.850
I DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING
ABOUT EXPORTS, I'M AFRAID.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.722
- THANK YOU.

40:26.091 --> 40:29.795
- YOU SEEM BURDENED,
MR. TAGOMI.

40:29.861 --> 40:34.500
- [sighs]
I HAVE CONSULTED THE I CHING.

40:34.566 --> 40:37.836
- THOSE STICKS YOU THROW.

40:37.903 --> 40:41.239
- ORACLE FAVORS OUR MEETING.
- GOOD TO HEAR,

40:41.306 --> 40:44.275
SINCE BOTH OUR GOVERNMENTS
WOULD EXECUTE US

40:44.342 --> 40:46.177
IF THEY KNEW WE WERE TALKING.

40:46.244 --> 40:49.414
- THE MAN YOU ARE TO MEET
WILL ARRIVE FROM TOKYO

40:49.481 --> 40:51.116
IN TWO DAYS' TIME.

40:51.182 --> 40:54.520
- HE'S TRAVELING WITH
THE CROWN PRINCE AND PRINCESS?

40:56.087 --> 40:58.757
- AND WHAT NEWS DO YOU
BRING FROM BERLIN?

41:00.425 --> 41:04.630
- THE FÃœHRER'S HEALTH IS POOR,
AND GOEBBELS AND HIMMLER,

41:04.696 --> 41:08.066
THEY'RE JOCKEYING FOR POWER.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.835
- NEITHER SEEKS PEACE.

41:09.901 --> 41:13.038
- THEY DENY IT IN PUBLIC,
BUT BOTH MEN THINK

41:13.104 --> 41:17.042
THE PARTITION
OF THE AMERICAS WAS A MISTAKE.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.912
THEY'VE DROPPED
THE BOMB BEFORE,

41:20.979 --> 41:25.150
AND THEY WON'T HESITATE
TO DROP IT AGAIN.

41:25.216 --> 41:28.419
- THEN THERE WILL BE WAR.

41:28.554 --> 41:30.756
- ONCE THE FÃœHRER DIES...

41:32.123 --> 41:34.159
WITHOUT QUESTION.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.795
AND THIS CITY WOULD BE
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES

41:36.862 --> 41:39.665
TO BE ERASED FROM THE MAP.

41:41.800 --> 41:45.003
WHAT ARE YOU SO GLOOMY
ABOUT, MR. TAGOMI?

41:45.070 --> 41:48.674
YOU SAID THE ORACLE
FAVORS OUR MEETING.

41:51.009 --> 41:54.680
- FATE IS FLUID,
COLONEL WEGENER.

41:54.746 --> 41:58.617
DESTINY IS IN
THE HANDS OF MEN.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.465
- YOU KNOW OUR ONLY HOPE,
DON'T YOU?

42:14.600 --> 42:15.734
- WE'VE GOT NO HOPE.

42:15.801 --> 42:17.669
- YOU'RE WRONG. IT'S ROMMEL.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.171
- ROMMEL?
- YEAH.

42:20.238 --> 42:21.406
ALL THESE LITTLE RATS--

42:21.472 --> 42:23.408
GOEBBELS AND HIMMLER
AND GORING--

42:23.474 --> 42:25.811
ALL SCURRYING AROUND, WAITING
FOR THE OLD MAN TO DIE.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.747
THE DESERT FOX SWOOPS IN,
WIPES 'EM ALL OUT.

42:28.814 --> 42:30.181
- ROMMEL'S RETIRED.

42:30.248 --> 42:32.150
- YEAH, BUT HE'S STILL
IN HIS EARLY 70s.

42:32.217 --> 42:34.019
HE'S A HELL OF A LOT MORE
VIGOROUS THAN MR. MUSTACHE,

42:34.085 --> 42:36.154
DON'T YOU THINK?
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.958
COVER FOR ME, WILL YOU?
- OKAY, SURE.

42:40.025 --> 42:42.427
- MR. MATSON?
- YEAH, FRANK?

42:42.493 --> 42:44.162
- UH, I'M--I'M JUST WONDERING,

42:44.229 --> 42:46.431
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO LOOK AT THE DESIGNS?

42:46.497 --> 42:48.667
- YOU JUST GAVE THEM TO ME
THIS MORNING, FRANK.

42:48.734 --> 42:50.168
- RIGHT. AND?

42:50.235 --> 42:52.103
- AND AS IT HAPPENS,
I HAVE LOOKED AT THEM.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.205
THEY'RE QUITE BEAUTIFUL.
- THANK YOU.

42:54.272 --> 42:57.075
- BUT LOOK,
THEY'RE DEGENERATE, FRANK.

42:57.142 --> 42:58.543
- YOU JUST SAID
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

42:58.644 --> 43:00.211
HOW CAN JEWELRY BE DEGENERATE?

43:00.278 --> 43:02.180
- JAPS ONLY WANT
THE OLD-TIMEY STUFF,

43:02.247 --> 43:04.816
LIKE THE COLT .45s--
AMERICANA.

43:04.883 --> 43:06.652
- NO ONE HAS ACTUALLY TRIED
SELLING THEM JEWELRY.

43:06.718 --> 43:08.019
- AND NO ONE'S GOING TO.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.155
COME ON, FRANK,
COME BACK FROM FAIRYLAND.

43:10.221 --> 43:13.291
YOU'RE A SOLID WORKER.
YOU'VE GOT A SOLID JOB.

43:13.358 --> 43:15.026
COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS.

43:57.769 --> 44:01.172
- MAY I?
- SURE.

44:01.239 --> 44:03.909
- GUY NEXT TO ME
WAS JUST SNORING.

44:03.975 --> 44:07.813
I CAN NEVER SLEEP
ON BUSES. CAN YOU?

44:07.879 --> 44:09.781
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THE NEUTRAL ZONE?

44:09.848 --> 44:11.449
- OH, JUST VISITING A FRIEND.

44:11.516 --> 44:13.985
- YOU MUST HAVE
SOME INTERESTING FRIENDS.

44:14.052 --> 44:15.353
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

44:15.420 --> 44:17.622
- YOU SEE ANY OTHER
WHITE GIRLS ON THIS BUS?

44:17.723 --> 44:19.457
I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AROUND,
DARLIN'.

44:19.524 --> 44:24.062
WRONG COLOR, WRONG RELIGION,
WRONG BEDMATE.

44:24.129 --> 44:27.332
THE NAZIS CATCH 'EM, AND POOF!
UP IN SMOKE THEY GO.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.500
BUT THE JAPS ARE HAPPY
TO LET 'EM SCRAMBLE

44:29.567 --> 44:30.902
OUT OF THE PACIFIC STATES.

44:30.969 --> 44:33.104
THEY CAN HOLE UP
IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS

44:33.171 --> 44:35.340
OR RUN DOWN TO SOUTH AMERICA
IF THEY LIKE.

44:35.406 --> 44:37.642
- WHAT'S IT LIKE,
THE NEUTRAL ZONE?

44:37.743 --> 44:39.277
- [chuckles]

44:39.344 --> 44:42.948
YOU EVER SEEN THEM WESTERNS
THAT THE FÃœHRER WATCHES?

44:43.014 --> 44:45.183
IT'S LIKE THAT-- LAWLESS.

44:45.250 --> 44:46.885
EXCEPT FOR THE MARSHAL,
OF COURSE.

44:46.952 --> 44:49.254
- THE MARSHAL?

44:49.320 --> 44:52.758
- THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME,
ISN'T IT?

44:52.758 --> 44:54.159
HE'S A NAZI AGENT,

44:54.225 --> 44:56.261
AND HE HUNTS DOWN
ENEMIES OF THE REICH.

44:56.327 --> 45:00.298
HE STRINGS 'EM UP
AND HE BURNS 'EM ALIVE.

45:00.365 --> 45:01.632
KATIE OWENS.

45:01.767 --> 45:06.905
- OH.
TRUDY...WALKER.

45:56.988 --> 45:59.958
[line ringing]

46:05.363 --> 46:11.336
[dogs barking]

47:40.959 --> 47:43.261
- JULES?

47:50.535 --> 47:52.270
JULES?

48:02.547 --> 48:04.082
JESUS.

48:18.964 --> 48:21.066
- HEY!
[banging on window]

48:22.267 --> 48:25.503
HEY, SHE HAS MY BAG.
SHE HAS MY THINGS.

48:25.570 --> 48:29.074
WAIT! STOP.
CAN YOU WAIT? WAIT.

48:30.408 --> 48:31.609
PLEASE...

48:31.676 --> 48:34.845
PLEASE WAIT, SIR.
I LEFT SOMETHING OUT THERE.

48:34.980 --> 48:36.581
- THE BUS IS LEAVING.
- NO.

49:23.328 --> 49:25.163
- WHERE IS THIS MAN'S MINDER?

49:25.230 --> 49:28.033
- I'LL FIND HIM,
OBERGRUPPENFÃœHRER.

49:40.178 --> 49:42.180
- [sighs]

49:44.649 --> 49:47.318
[footsteps approach]

49:52.723 --> 49:54.192
- HEIL HITLER.

49:54.259 --> 49:56.561
- WHY WAS THIS MAN
LEFT UNATTENDED?

49:56.627 --> 49:58.363
- THE...

49:58.429 --> 50:00.831
SUBJECT IS UNCONSCIOUSNESS,
OBERGRUPPENFÃœHRER.

50:00.898 --> 50:02.767
- YES, I CAN SEE THAT.

50:04.135 --> 50:07.172
YOUR ORDERS
WERE TO FLOG THIS MAN

50:07.238 --> 50:08.806
UNTIL HE ANSWERED
YOUR QUESTIONS.

50:08.873 --> 50:12.677
- OBERGRUPPENFÃœHRER,
THE SUBJECT CANNOT WAKE UP.

50:12.743 --> 50:14.779
- HAS HE ANSWERED
YOUR QUESTIONS?

50:14.845 --> 50:16.481
- NO, OBERGRUPPENFÃœHRER.

50:16.547 --> 50:20.085
- THEN YOUR ORDERS ARE
KEEP FLOGGING HIM.

50:20.151 --> 50:25.390
YOU TORTURE MEN.

50:25.456 --> 50:27.358
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH BEATING A MAN TO DEATH?

50:27.425 --> 50:30.328
- NO, OBERGRUPPENFÃœHRER.
- GOOD.

50:30.395 --> 50:33.164
THEN DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.

50:36.967 --> 50:38.503
YOU'RE SMILING, ERICH.

50:38.569 --> 50:40.238
- YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWERS

50:40.305 --> 50:42.073
TO ANY OF QUESTIONS
THAT HE WOULD ASK THIS MAN.

50:42.140 --> 50:43.908
- OF COURSE.
- SO THE SUBJECT WILL DIE

50:43.974 --> 50:45.610
IN CAPTIVITY.
- INDEED.

50:45.676 --> 50:47.478
- HIS FRIENDS IN THE RESISTANCE
WILL SEE HIS DISFIGURED BODY,

50:47.545 --> 50:50.115
AND THEY WILL CONCLUDE THAT HE
WAS ONLY SO BADLY BEATEN

50:50.181 --> 50:51.716
BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO TALK.

50:51.782 --> 50:53.751
- THEY WILL CONCLUDE
THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT TRUCK

50:53.818 --> 50:57.755
IS HEADED TO CANON CITY,
OR WHAT IT IS CARRYING.

50:57.822 --> 51:00.591
- I HAVE MUCH TO LEARN
FROM YOU, OBERGRUPPENFÃœHRER.

51:03.128 --> 51:07.198
[teapot whistle blowing]

51:22.046 --> 51:24.815
- [speaking Japanese]

52:06.724 --> 52:08.559
[knocking on door]

52:10.428 --> 52:12.997
- MR. FRINK?
- YES.

52:13.063 --> 52:14.665
- INSPECTOR KIDO.

52:14.732 --> 52:17.202
- HEY.
HEY, HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

52:17.235 --> 52:19.437
WHAT IS THIS?

52:19.504 --> 52:22.840
- YOU COHABIT THIS APARTMENT
WITH MISS JULIANA CRAIN,

52:22.907 --> 52:25.543
DO YOU NOT?

52:25.610 --> 52:26.977
- UH, YES.

52:27.044 --> 52:28.846
- WHERE IS MISS CRAIN?

52:28.913 --> 52:31.816
- I DON'T KNOW.
SHE LEFT EARLY THIS MORNING.

52:31.882 --> 52:33.117
AIKIDO PRACTICE.

52:33.218 --> 52:38.122
- OH, AIKIDO PRACTICE.
[phone ringing]

52:38.223 --> 52:41.959
- THE DOJO ON MISSION STREET.

52:42.026 --> 52:44.795
[phone ringing]

52:46.397 --> 52:48.499
- ARE YOU AWARE
THAT MISS CRAIN'S HALF-SISTER,

52:48.566 --> 52:52.237
MISS TRUDY WALKER, WAS ENGAGED
IN TREASONOUS ACTIVITY?

52:52.270 --> 52:54.239
[phone ringing]
- TRUDY? NO.

52:54.305 --> 52:55.773
I DIDN'T KEEP
IN TOUCH WITH HER.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.808
NEITHER DID JULIANA.

52:57.875 --> 53:00.245
[phone ringing]

53:00.311 --> 53:02.947
- AREN'T YOU GOING
TO GET THAT?

53:03.013 --> 53:04.815
- SURE, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

53:11.789 --> 53:14.592
[phone ringing]

53:17.895 --> 53:19.897
[phone ringing]

53:24.269 --> 53:27.672
[dial tone]

53:27.738 --> 53:29.507
TOO LATE.

53:36.747 --> 53:39.750
- THIS IS A NATIONAL
SECURITY MATTER, MR. FRINK.

53:39.817 --> 53:42.453
THE PENALTIES
FOR PERJURY ARE SEVERE.

53:44.088 --> 53:45.623
- I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

53:47.325 --> 53:48.793
- [speaking Japanese]

53:56.601 --> 53:59.670
* ...SHOW THAT A GOOD WOMAN *

53:59.737 --> 54:04.575
- * MY SO-CALLED BEST FRIENDS *

54:06.176 --> 54:10.615
* THEY FINALLY SEE
THE MISERY *

54:10.681 --> 54:14.319
* OF THIS HELL I'M LIVIN' IN *

54:24.329 --> 54:28.799
* IT WAS BECKY, ME,
AND BOBBY JACK *

54:28.866 --> 54:32.870
* ALL FOR ONE
AND ONE FOR ALL *

54:32.937 --> 54:37.241
* WHEN BECKY AND BOBBY
TOOK OFF WITH THE CASH *

54:37.342 --> 54:43.213
* ME, I TOOK THE FALL *

54:43.348 --> 54:46.050
* BECKY AND ME... *

54:46.116 --> 54:48.953
- I'M SO SORRY,
I CAN'T PAY YOU.

54:49.019 --> 54:50.355
- YOU WHAT?

54:50.421 --> 54:52.022
- SOMEONE STOLE MY WALLET,
ALL MY MONEY.

54:52.089 --> 54:54.224
I'M REALLY SORRY.
- THIS AIN'T NO CHARITY, LADY.

54:54.359 --> 54:56.126
- I KNOW.
I'M REALLY EMBARRASSED.

54:56.193 --> 54:57.628
- HOW YOU GONNA PAY ME?

54:57.695 --> 54:59.397
- I TOLD YOU, I CAN'T.

54:59.464 --> 55:00.731
- WRONG ANSWER.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.767
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY ME?
- I--

55:02.833 --> 55:04.369
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO
TO FOLKS AROUND HERE

55:04.369 --> 55:05.803
WHO DON'T PAY THEIR BILLS?

55:05.870 --> 55:07.472
- I'LL PAY FOR IT.

55:07.538 --> 55:10.140
- NO, I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY,
WHOEVER YOU ARE.

55:10.207 --> 55:12.109
I--
- OH, YES, YOU DO.

55:12.176 --> 55:13.578
THAT'S 2 MARKS, PLEASE.

55:16.947 --> 55:18.449
- THERE YOU GO.

55:22.387 --> 55:24.555
- I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO DO THAT.

55:24.622 --> 55:26.457
- I KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

55:26.524 --> 55:28.559
YOU'RE WELCOME, BY THE WAY.

55:50.247 --> 55:51.616
- HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

55:52.850 --> 55:53.951
- NO PLACE.

55:57.422 --> 55:59.123
- CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

56:02.159 --> 56:04.895
AFTER YOU.

56:04.962 --> 56:09.600
- I GUESS I SHOULD THANK YOU
FOR WHAT YOU DID BACK THERE.

56:09.667 --> 56:11.469
- IT'S NO PROBLEM.

56:11.536 --> 56:15.039
- YOU ALWAYS SO HELPFUL
TO STRANGERS?

56:15.105 --> 56:16.874
- PRETTY ONES, I AM.

56:19.143 --> 56:21.612
- I CAN'T PAY YOU BACK.

56:21.679 --> 56:24.849
- YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU COULD.

56:32.322 --> 56:35.092
- NO--NO!
- SO WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

56:35.159 --> 56:36.561
- I'M TRUDY.

56:36.627 --> 56:38.763
- TRUDY, PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

56:38.829 --> 56:39.930
I'M JOE.

56:43.934 --> 56:45.636
- OH!
[coughs]

56:49.006 --> 56:52.743
- SO HOW LONG YOU BEEN
IN CANON CITY, TRUDY?

56:52.810 --> 56:55.345
- JUST GOT HERE,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

56:55.480 --> 56:56.647
HOW ABOUT YOU?

56:56.714 --> 56:58.749
- I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH.

56:58.816 --> 57:01.852
THAT'S, UH,
MY TRUCK OVER THERE.

57:14.131 --> 57:18.002
- YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR
ANYONE NAMED TRUDY, WERE YOU?

57:18.068 --> 57:19.504
- NO.

57:25.375 --> 57:29.914
- SO THIS IS-- YOU REALLY
JUST WANTED TO TALK?

57:29.980 --> 57:32.817
- YEAH, WHY?
IS THAT SO WEIRD?

57:35.385 --> 57:39.590
- NOPE. GUESS NOT.

57:55.205 --> 57:57.808
- AW. CRUD.

57:57.875 --> 57:59.143
- WHAT?

57:59.209 --> 58:00.845

58:04.615 --> 58:07.184
[line ringing]

58:13.457 --> 58:15.560
Joe: HEY, IT'S ME.

58:15.626 --> 58:18.863
- Smith: HOW WAS YOUR JOURNEY?

58:18.929 --> 58:21.766
- NO ONE STOPPED ME.
- THEN YOUR COVER'S INTACT.

58:21.832 --> 58:23.768
I'LL TELL YOUR FATHER, JOE.

58:23.834 --> 58:25.135
I KNOW HE'LL BE VERY PROUD.

58:25.202 --> 58:27.572
- THANK YOU,
OBERGRUPPENFÃœHRER.

58:27.572 --> 58:29.740
