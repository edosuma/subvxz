00:07.002 --> 00:09.522
<i>I was 12 years old

00:09.682 --> 00:11.402
<i>I saw my father killed.</i>

00:12.202 --> 00:16.282
<i>Stolen by the invaders,
along with the Saxon girl Brida,</i>

00:16.442 --> 00:20.482
<i>I became first</i> a <i>slave,
and then</i> a <i>son to Earl Ragnar.</i>

00:21.482 --> 00:24.442
<i>Fate had made me</i> a <i>Dane.</i>

00:24.882 --> 00:29.042
<i>It made Young Ragnar my brother,
and Brida my lover.</i>

00:29.882 --> 00:33.122
- <i>And then fate brought betrayal.</i>
- Fire!

- (MAN) Clear the way.
- Stand clear! It is the king!

01:43.842 --> 01:46.282
(ODDA) I have to speak, lord.
The axe cut deep.

01:46.442 --> 01:50.162

02:17.282 --> 02:18.602
Apologies, lord,

02:18.762 --> 02:22.042
this was the best I could do
without first speaking to Alfred.

02:22.202 --> 02:24.522
I have brought food and ale,

02:24.682 --> 02:27.922
,- and more importantly, good news.
- Alfred is dead?

02:29.002 --> 02:32.002
The opposite.
He is alive and he is victorious.

02:32.162 --> 02:34.682
We defeated the Danes.

(BRIDA GRUNTING)

02:36.722 --> 02:39.482
- Why is this good news?
- Alfred acted upon your advice.

02:39.642 --> 02:42.162
- You share in his glory.
- (BRIDA) Glory?

02:43.042 --> 02:45.842
Then why is he caged and left to shit
in the corner?

02:46.002 --> 02:47.442
You call that glory?

02:47.602 --> 02:49.002
Can she not hold her tongue
forjust one moment?

02:49.162 --> 02:52.802
No she cannot and she will not!

- Keep your food!
- (BEOCCA) Only Alfred--

02:55.322 --> 02:58.722
- (BRIDA) I will not eat or drink!
- Only Alfred can order your release.

02:58.882 --> 03:00.322
I will speak with him.

03:00.482 --> 03:03.682
You should spend this time, girl,
to contemplate improvement.

03:03.842 --> 03:07.442
I will use this time to curse you.

03:07.602 --> 03:10.722
- Then do it.
- Alfred refused my sword.

03:13.082 --> 03:15.362
I won't be offering it again
unless he begs.

03:15.522 --> 03:17.682
Lord, I wonder whether
your pig-headedness

03:17.842 --> 03:19.602
is not simple stupidity.

the mud and blood from his mail.

I didn't see you?

05:30.642 --> 05:34.442
I was kept safe with the priests.

05:38.802 --> 05:42.042
There will be other battles, many.

And on and on it will go, I'm sure,
until we are all dead.

- Never.

05:49.122 --> 05:50.882
Never.

05:58.162 --> 06:00.282

has already decreed.

with the king's successor.

06:09.322 --> 06:12.162
The crown is mine, my birth right.

06:13.562 --> 06:15.002
You disagree?

06:15.162 --> 06:17.562
The argument
will be that you are young, lord.

06:17.722 --> 06:20.522
- I am my father's heir.
- You are your father's heir,

06:20.682 --> 06:23.122
but your father
was also bonded to Alfred.

06:25.042 --> 06:27.682
A son comes before a brother.

06:31.722 --> 06:34.442
Then perhaps you should speak
to the king directly.

06:36.842 --> 06:38.722
'Tis my thinking, lord,

06:38.882 --> 06:42.602
that if on his death bed your father
were to name you as his successor,

the Witan would find it
difficult to go against him.

06:46.162 --> 06:50.002
I believe your father would only be
too happy to whisper in your ear,

06:50.242 --> 06:52.882
whether he was conscious or not.

Your counsel will not be forgotten,

without me.

07:16.282 --> 07:17.762
Why was that?

07:17.922 --> 07:19.442
That was not the intention.

07:21.402 --> 07:23.282
Is that so?

07:24.402 --> 07:25.722
Then why did it happen?

- We will talk here.

than we expected,

themselves well on the hill.

- It will not happen again.
- It will not happen again

07:38.802 --> 07:40.922
because you have lost
half your men.

07:41.082 --> 07:43.642

- Yeah, I saw him fall,

- It's still there.

- I am not lost.

- Is my apology enough?
- It is not, lord.

is that it is not necessary.

- This is England.

- Since when?
- (ALFRED) I have not long left him.

15:46.122 --> 15:50.242
You will take a message
to Guthrum, to the Danes.

15:50.442 --> 15:52.842
You will invite them
to negotiate within days,

15:53.002 --> 15:54.522
but at their own convenience.

15:56.362 --> 15:59.562
If it is a messenger you require, lord,
there are plenty within the palace--

15:59.722 --> 16:02.722
It is not a messenger I require,
it is a representative.

16:03.322 --> 16:04.962
You will speak for me.

16:05.122 --> 16:07.682
Odda, you will speak as me.

16:08.722 --> 16:11.402
Nothing can be written for the Danes.

16:11.562 --> 16:13.282
My letters would be meaningless,

16:13.442 --> 16:15.442
therefore the words spoken

16:15.602 --> 16:17.922
must be my words,

16:18.082 --> 16:21.082
and I entrust them to you.

16:22.442 --> 16:25.082
Then I shall gladly be
your representative, lord.

16:26.362 --> 16:27.882
Thank you.

16:34.082 --> 16:37.082
Do I offend you? Watching you?

16:37.242 --> 16:40.082
No, my lord, never.

16:41.882 --> 16:44.602
I will defend you with my life.

16:46.482 --> 16:50.122
You stand as everything that's precious.
You are Wessex, England,

16:50.282 --> 16:53.642
always to be cherished,
never to be violated,

16:53.802 --> 16:57.682
only to be loved vigorously.

16:57.882 --> 16:59.202
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

16:59.362 --> 17:01.362
- Who is it?
- (BEOCCA) My lord.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.482
My conscience.

17:04.962 --> 17:09.521
My lord, would you care to join me
in prayer for the passing of the king?

17:09.682 --> 17:12.242
I will, Father. I give you my thanks.

17:13.602 --> 17:15.321
Forgive me, my lord,

17:15.482 --> 17:17.642
the milk has soured.

17:22.561 --> 17:26.162
I am tired of milk and apples.
I need meat.

17:26.321 --> 17:28.521
But you are a martyr, my lord,
to meat.

17:28.682 --> 17:30.482
My lord needs feeding.

17:30.642 --> 17:32.802
My lord is not a saint
and never shall be.

17:32.962 --> 17:35.602
I have survived battle, I need meat.

17:37.882 --> 17:41.362
We shall pray together, my lord,
for strength.

17:41.962 --> 17:44.522
Why does it have to be a sin?

17:52.562 --> 17:55.082
Already, it is a burden.

17:56.962 --> 17:59.602
It seems never to be about
what I would wish to do,

17:59.762 --> 18:02.882
it is about what I must do.

18:06.842 --> 18:11.282
Ask God to give me the strength
to wear the crown as well as you.

18:20.442 --> 18:22.322
Father Beocca.

18:22.482 --> 18:24.442
- A moment.
- Yes, lord.

18:24.602 --> 18:27.042
Uhtred may well have a use.

18:27.282 --> 18:29.882
I'm pleased that is what you think, lord.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.002
This Brida, she is what to him?

18:32.162 --> 18:34.002
- I would say a hindrance.
- A wife?

18:34.162 --> 18:37.402
- No, no. Never, no.
- She is restless.

18:37.562 --> 18:41.642
- She is the devil on his shoulder, I fear.
- But he is fond of her.

18:42.242 --> 18:45.042
Yes, that is his way.

18:45.402 --> 18:46.882
We shall see.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.482
- Thank you.
- My lord.

19:21.242 --> 19:22.962
(YOUNGER) I carry a message.

19:23.122 --> 19:26.082
- From King Alfred.
- Who is King Alfred?

19:26.242 --> 19:28.242
He is, Alfred, King of Wessex.

19:28.402 --> 19:31.562
He invites the Earl Guthrum
to negotiate a peace.

19:31.722 --> 19:33.602
You are Guthrum?

19:33.842 --> 19:36.322
Get down from your horse, boy.

19:36.482 --> 19:39.362
Get down from your horse
and look at me.

19:45.282 --> 19:48.042
You are a beauty.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.722
Tell this king, what was his name?

19:52.882 --> 19:54.682
Alfred.

19:55.522 --> 19:58.802
Tell King Alfred
that Guthrum accepts his invitation,

19:58.962 --> 20:02.202
and I will watch for him
and I shall ride out and meet him.

20:02.362 --> 20:04.562
I will pass on your message, lord.

20:09.202 --> 20:11.002
This horse belongs to me now.

20:14.442 --> 20:17.642
Uhtred, Alfred is keen
to find a use for you,

20:17.802 --> 20:21.562
but Brida is... She's not a help.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.282
Perhaps you could just
keep her away from him.

20:23.442 --> 20:26.122
Alfred knows I can be of use,
and I have proven it.

20:26.282 --> 20:28.602
Now he must prove
he can be of use to me.

20:28.762 --> 20:31.082
- He will be king.
- And you can serve him.

20:31.242 --> 20:32.922
I'm here to serve myself.

20:33.082 --> 20:36.322
Alfred means nothing but a path
to take back what is mine.

20:36.482 --> 20:39.362
My land, my wealth, and my title.

20:39.522 --> 20:42.482
He will have a use for me,
but I will have a use for him.

20:42.962 --> 20:46.002
Do not think him na'l've.
He will see right through you.

20:46.162 --> 20:49.322
He will see what I allow him to see.

20:50.202 --> 20:54.242
Look, Uhtred, right now
you are a warrior, not a thinker.

20:55.122 --> 20:57.122
Though, in time, this will come.

20:58.122 --> 21:00.642
You are much like your father,
and he was both.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.522
You are Alfred's priest now, Beocca.

21:12.762 --> 21:14.922
(LEOFRIC)
You looking for company, girl?

21:15.242 --> 21:19.082
I prefer the company of the gods
to stupid men.

21:19.682 --> 21:21.802
Another time, then?

22:49.042 --> 22:50.882
(FOOTSTEPS)

22:53.002 --> 22:56.202
- Good morning, Uhtred.
- (UHTRED) Good morning, lord.

23:05.122 --> 23:07.082
- That's a fine coat of mail.
- (ALFRED) It is.

23:07.242 --> 23:11.242
And it is yours, the battle dress
of a Saxon warrior. A gift.

23:11.402 --> 23:14.002
(UHTRED) In return for what?
There's always a price.

23:14.162 --> 23:15.642
(ALFRED) Which you have paid in full.

23:15.802 --> 23:17.762
Our victory at the hill.

23:17.922 --> 23:22.002
Young Odda, have you offered
your apologies to Uhtred?

23:24.282 --> 23:27.482
My sincere apologies,
you spoke the truth.

23:28.922 --> 23:31.282
A small bow, perhaps?

23:37.162 --> 23:38.762
You may leave us now.

23:45.042 --> 23:49.162
A good king relies upon
good advice, Uhtred.

23:49.802 --> 23:52.962
For example, my nephew,
Aethelwold, the king's son,

23:53.122 --> 23:55.722
he is young but sees himself
as the rightful heir.

23:55.882 --> 23:58.242
How am I to deal with him?

24:01.282 --> 24:03.122
You should kill him, lord,

24:03.282 --> 24:05.602
as my own uncle, Aelfric,
would kill me.

24:06.242 --> 24:08.362
- Not to kill him shows weakness.
- You are being insolent.

24:08.522 --> 24:09.842
I Will allow it,

24:10.002 --> 24:12.522
it is the pagan in him speaking.

24:12.682 --> 24:14.482
You think like a Dane, Uhtred.

24:15.282 --> 24:19.202
If I kill Aethelwold, I am admitting
he has legitimate claim to the throne,

24:19.362 --> 24:21.762
which he does not.
That is how I think.

24:23.002 --> 24:27.122
But to have a specimen of the heathen
mind in council will be useful.

24:27.962 --> 24:31.362
What do they fear most, the Danes?

24:31.802 --> 24:33.482
They're warriors, live to fight.

24:33.642 --> 24:36.362
But when they lose,
as at the hill, what then?

24:36.522 --> 24:39.442
In battle, they'd rather retreat
than lose too many men.

24:39.602 --> 24:42.162
If they fear anything at all,
it is losing men.

24:42.322 --> 24:44.762
They love to fight but hate to lose,

24:44.922 --> 24:46.482
hardly a revelation.

24:46.882 --> 24:48.642
Odda appears not to value
your council.

24:48.802 --> 24:50.122
- (ODDA) I do not.
- I care not.

24:50.282 --> 24:53.962
I have been thinking on your request
to be recognised as an ealdorman.

24:54.122 --> 24:56.562
- (ODDA) Which is a nonsense.
- I am an ealdorman.

24:56.722 --> 24:59.962
Without a goat to your name,
never mind the land to graze it.

25:00.122 --> 25:02.202
- I'm an ealdorman.
- Would you consider

25:02.362 --> 25:04.162
becoming an ealdorman
by marriage?

25:04.322 --> 25:07.282
I know of a marriage
that would bring you land and title.

25:07.442 --> 25:10.722
- I have no need of a wife. Grow old?
- A woman helps you grow.

25:10.882 --> 25:13.802
Grow roots, and that is what
you are missing.

25:13.962 --> 25:17.122
Marriage would show your commitment,
to Wessex.

25:17.282 --> 25:19.402
I have shown commitment.

25:19.562 --> 25:21.802
You've said yourself,
I gave you victory.

25:21.962 --> 25:25.002
You helped, but the victory
was won by the men of Wessex.

25:25.162 --> 25:27.882
Whom you now refuse to join
through this marriage.

25:28.042 --> 25:31.522
Land and silver is what all men desire
and I'm no different.

25:31.682 --> 25:33.442
But believe me, lord,
I have no need of a wife.

25:35.242 --> 25:38.042
- My sword is yours.
- (ODDA) At a price?

25:39.242 --> 25:42.642
Everything that I have
has been taken from me.

25:43.282 --> 25:45.522
I need title,
I need to make my wealth.

25:45.682 --> 25:49.282
Are you are offering me your sword
or are you selling me your sword?

25:50.762 --> 25:53.082
To become an ealdorman
you must possess land,

25:53.242 --> 25:57.562
that is the law.
However, stand at my side

25:57.722 --> 26:01.922
during the negotiations ahead,
help me read my enemy

26:02.082 --> 26:03.762
and in return

26:03.922 --> 26:07.842
we shall talk further of wealth
and reward.

- What did they show you?
- What I saw is my business. Unh!

26:36.242 --> 26:38.562
I feel unwell.

26:44.002 --> 26:45.402
Here.

26:46.882 --> 26:48.482

27:04.802 --> 27:07.482

the work of the three spinners,

27:10.602 --> 27:14.842
they sit deep in this earth beneath us
and they have brought us here.

27:16.122 --> 27:17.962
We should go...

27:19.322 --> 27:21.162
to Cornwalum,

27:21.322 --> 27:23.682
Wales, Ireland,

27:23.842 --> 27:25.442
- anywhere.
- Why?

27:26.002 --> 27:27.602
Escape.

27:31.362 --> 27:33.242
Safety.

27:35.642 --> 27:37.922
I saw Ragnar's ship.

27:38.082 --> 27:41.002
- The past?
- No. Wind Viper.

27:42.282 --> 27:43.602
Young Ragnar?

27:43.762 --> 27:47.042
I was there on the ship. I saw it.

27:47.602 --> 27:49.802
I want to leave here.

27:50.042 --> 27:51.842
Come with me.

27:54.522 --> 27:56.082
Come with me.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.882
I've given a promise to Alfred.

27:59.842 --> 28:02.122
To attend the negotiations, to advise.

28:08.122 --> 28:10.842
Brida, there's no place else
for us to go.

28:11.002 --> 28:13.682
We cannot stay here.

28:15.522 --> 28:17.402
It's a beginning.

28:20.842 --> 28:22.522
Leave me.

28:24.322 --> 28:26.842
We cannot wander the country
and do nothing.

28:27.002 --> 28:28.842
How can you trust him?

28:29.002 --> 28:31.082
How do you know he won't simply
turn you over to Guthrum

28:31.242 --> 28:33.682
to pass on to Ubba?
You know nothing about him.

28:33.842 --> 28:36.322
I trust Father Beocca,
and Beocca is his priest.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.402
I said leave me.

28:44.882 --> 28:47.602
You were not on the ship with me!

28:48.362 --> 28:51.362
Go to Alfred,
and I will watch him betray you!

29:10.482 --> 29:13.442
So, what do we know of this Alfred?

29:13.602 --> 29:15.882
That he is sickly, he's weak.

29:16.042 --> 29:18.242
He wants to negotiate.

29:18.722 --> 29:21.202
Turns out that he's no warrior.

29:21.922 --> 29:24.842
- But he beat you, Guthrum.
- (GUTHRUM) Heh, heh, heh.

29:29.922 --> 29:32.602

29:49.162 --> 29:50.882
Silver.

29:51.362 --> 29:54.002
We will take his silver

29:55.242 --> 29:56.922
and his land.

29:57.082 --> 30:00.002
(GUTHRUM) And If he refuses?
(UBBA) He will never refuse.

30:00.162 --> 30:04.602
He wants to live and he wants
to be called king. Heh, heh, heh.

31:31.642 --> 31:33.642
Our God in his heaven,

31:33.802 --> 31:39.682
we ask you to find favour
with your devoted servant, Alfred.

31:40.322 --> 31:43.522
Bless him with courage,

Wessex is Saxon, and as such
out-of-bounds to all Danes.

34:39.482 --> 34:41.641
We'll not be leaving Wessex.

34:41.802 --> 34:43.242
We only just arrived.

34:43.402 --> 34:45.002
Then you will starve.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.762
You have little food,

34:48.762 --> 34:50.442
no shelter and a weakened army.

34:50.601 --> 34:53.562
If you believe us weakened,
why seek peace?

34:54.362 --> 34:56.762
It is the Christian in me.

34:57.002 --> 34:58.442
The will of my God.

34:58.602 --> 35:02.162
- Oh, I will hear no talk of gods.
- God. There is only one.

35:02.322 --> 35:03.882
You will talk of grain,

35:04.562 --> 35:08.482
- horses, silver and land.
- I will not talk of land.

35:09.402 --> 35:11.202
What do they write?

35:11.362 --> 35:12.762
(ALFRED) They write what we speak.

35:12.922 --> 35:15.002
- Every word?
- Yes, every word.

35:15.162 --> 35:18.002
Then may I say arse,

35:18.162 --> 35:19.882
tits, hump and turd.

35:20.442 --> 35:23.042
They record history.
We are here creating history.

35:23.202 --> 35:25.642
People will read of this very meeting.

35:25.802 --> 35:27.722
I'm waiting to hear your surrender.

35:27.882 --> 35:30.162
You will be paid for your return
to Lundene.

35:30.322 --> 35:33.842
There are no more terms
and there will be no surrender.

35:34.002 --> 35:38.562
Guthrum here will not
leave Readingum.

35:38.722 --> 35:40.482
Then I say again, he will starve.

35:40.642 --> 35:42.122
(GUTHRUM) We will raid.

35:42.282 --> 35:43.602
We Will kill.

35:43.762 --> 35:45.802
And you will lose yet more men.

35:46.042 --> 35:48.762
Is that your wish, Earl Guthrum,

35:48.922 --> 35:50.362
to lose men?

35:50.522 --> 35:54.522
Your surviving warriors
may look to find a new lord.

35:54.682 --> 35:56.602
Did you call a meeting to insult me?

35:56.762 --> 35:59.002
I offer peace and I offer facts.

36:01.002 --> 36:03.562
(UBBA)
His head, and you can have your peace.

36:04.642 --> 36:06.242
Him.

36:13.042 --> 36:16.002
Uhtred Ragnarson.

36:16.962 --> 36:18.322
A traitor.

36:25.282 --> 36:29.202
- Nothing to say?
- I'll speak to young Ragnar.

36:29.362 --> 36:32.282
No other Dane has my respect.

36:32.442 --> 36:34.482
His head, for peace.

36:34.642 --> 36:36.282
You want Uhtred here for peace?

36:36.442 --> 36:39.962
No silver, no grain, no horses?

36:40.122 --> 36:43.082
We want silver,
and the traitors head.

36:43.242 --> 36:46.642
These are the terms.
And you, Alfred, heh,

36:46.802 --> 36:49.202
you may remain king,

36:49.362 --> 36:53.482
but we will occupy
all of the Saxon forts.

36:53.642 --> 36:57.162
If you wish to occupy the fortresses,
then do it, take them.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.482
How many have you taken to date?

37:02.402 --> 37:05.682
- How many have they taken to date?
- None, lord.

37:08.802 --> 37:11.002
We can take all fortresses at any time!

37:11.882 --> 37:15.402
We have taken the whole of England.

37:17.842 --> 37:20.202
And we can do the same with Wessex.

37:20.362 --> 37:22.642
Let me be clear.

37:22.802 --> 37:25.642
I'm prepared to return to the sword.
We outnumber you.

37:25.802 --> 37:29.882
We are many and we are dangerous,
but I would prefer to establish a peace.

37:30.042 --> 37:32.002
And Uhtred here shall keep his head,

37:32.162 --> 37:35.682
but I will pay you well to leave Wessex.

37:36.482 --> 37:38.842
That is what people will read.

37:39.002 --> 37:41.242
That Alfred sought peace.

37:41.402 --> 37:46.482
Alfred paid Lords Ubba and Guthrum
in silver in exchange for peace.

37:47.002 --> 37:50.282
It is I who is seeking an end
to the fighting.

37:51.162 --> 37:53.642
That is what will be written.

38:15.602 --> 38:17.042
Uhtred.

38:21.402 --> 38:25.042
I would never have given you up
to Ubba.

38:25.202 --> 38:27.362
But the thought
did cross your mind, lord.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.322
Not once.

38:29.482 --> 38:30.802
The fact is,

38:30.962 --> 38:33.842
I would like you to swear an oath,

38:34.002 --> 38:37.402
on holy relics, a years' service.

38:37.802 --> 38:40.642
During which time you will help
my warriors understand

38:40.802 --> 38:44.402
that the heathens are but men,

38:44.562 --> 38:46.522
and in return, and in time,

38:46.682 --> 38:49.162
you shall have your own reward.

38:49.402 --> 38:51.802
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

38:54.602 --> 38:56.202
One year.

39:33.802 --> 39:35.322
(MAN) Boy.

39:44.042 --> 39:45.722
For the king.

39:57.322 --> 40:00.282
(ALFRED) They have been halted,
but nothing more.

40:01.002 --> 40:03.242
They are not defeated.

40:03.762 --> 40:06.362
Our task now is both simple
and impossible.

40:06.522 --> 40:10.242
- We determine what they will do.
- They will do what Danes do, attack.

40:10.402 --> 40:11.842
(ALFRED)
How? Where? When? How many?

40:12.002 --> 40:15.722
We're supposed to be celebrating peace,
do we have to talk of fighting?

40:15.882 --> 40:19.042
(ALFRED) We do, my dear,
because the peace will not last.

40:19.482 --> 40:23.202
It'll take at least a year before they
can gather a second great army.

40:23.362 --> 40:25.122
(YOUNGER) Do we have your word?
(ODDA) Son.

40:25.282 --> 40:26.682
Is there any meat here?

40:26.842 --> 40:29.282
- Should she even be here?
- Brida is my guest.

40:29.442 --> 40:32.642
You should have taken up
the king's offer of a wife.

40:32.802 --> 40:34.122
A lady.

40:34.282 --> 40:37.282
(ALFRED) What happens next is that
they will come by land and sea.

40:37.442 --> 40:40.322
They will split our army in two,
possibly more.

40:40.482 --> 40:44.322
Now, Uhtred may be correct,
this may not occur for a year or more,

40:44.482 --> 40:48.322
but what is clear
is that we need ships.

40:48.922 --> 40:52.042
We are bordered by water,
yet we have so few ships.

40:52.202 --> 40:53.922
You'll not get me on a ship.

40:54.082 --> 40:55.842
L'll volunteer my son.

40:56.002 --> 40:59.322
To save our shores,
we have to look beyond them,

40:59.482 --> 41:01.642
and to serve God,

41:01.802 --> 41:05.042
- his word must travel.
- Amen. Praise him.

41:05.202 --> 41:06.602
Uhtred, the beasts,

41:07.242 --> 41:08.762
on the prows of Danes' ships,

41:08.922 --> 41:12.002
they are a representation
of their gods?

41:12.162 --> 41:14.162
No, lord. They are just beasts.

41:14.322 --> 41:18.082
They can be lifted, so not
to frighten the spirits of the land.

41:18.242 --> 41:20.082
Spirits of the land. Heh, heh.

41:20.242 --> 41:23.842
I'd like to know why some of them
make their own teeth into points.

41:24.002 --> 41:26.122
- They do that?
- Some, lady.

41:26.282 --> 41:28.002
(AELSWITH) God save us.

41:28.162 --> 41:30.242
To show that they aren't afraid.

41:30.402 --> 41:34.322
If they can inflict pain on themselves,
think what they can do to a Saxon.

41:34.482 --> 41:37.202
(ALFRED) We will understand them more
by the day, I'm sure.

41:37.362 --> 41:40.842
Uhtred of the Danes has promised me
a year of his service.

41:42.802 --> 41:44.242
Is that so?

41:44.402 --> 41:45.842
(ALFRED) It is.

41:46.002 --> 41:48.602
It will be his responsibility
to show our warriors

41:48.762 --> 41:50.402
how the Danes approach battle,

41:50.602 --> 41:53.642
the construction of their shield wall,
and the like.

41:53.802 --> 41:55.762
(LEOFRIC) Lord, if I may.

41:55.922 --> 42:00.802
The arseling here is barely a man,
you expect him to teach me to fight?

42:00.962 --> 42:03.722
Leofric, I expect him
to teach you nothing.

42:04.442 --> 42:07.842
Whip him with staves in practise
by all means.

42:08.002 --> 42:09.362
(LEOFRIC) Thank you, lord.

42:09.522 --> 42:10.922
(ALFRED) But,

42:11.322 --> 42:13.122
our lesser men,

42:13.282 --> 42:15.562
if they can know what a Dane knows,

42:16.482 --> 42:20.002
fear can be expelled with knowledge,

42:20.402 --> 42:22.962
regardless how sharp their teeth.

42:36.522 --> 42:38.322
You didn't eat tonight.

42:38.482 --> 42:40.562
I'd only throw it up.

42:41.442 --> 42:43.002
A Year?

42:43.202 --> 42:44.642
(UHTRED SIGHS)

42:45.242 --> 42:48.042
It starts with a year
and becomes a lifetime.

42:49.442 --> 42:50.802
And he offered you a wife?

42:50.962 --> 42:52.282
I have no need of a wife.

42:52.442 --> 42:54.522
Instead you swore an oath
to kill Danes.

42:54.682 --> 42:56.842
You know my reasons.

42:58.162 --> 43:00.562
We have been living in a palace.

43:01.522 --> 43:03.282
What happens if you find yourself

43:03.442 --> 43:06.682
facing young Ragnar in battle?

43:10.522 --> 43:12.202
We fight.

43:40.042 --> 43:41.362
Where is she?

43:41.522 --> 43:44.882
- I haven't heard her all morning.
- She'll not be far.

43:45.242 --> 43:46.762
Well, we're about to leave.

43:46.922 --> 43:48.682
I can see.

43:49.842 --> 43:51.402
I'll follow.

- Hm?

45:21.322 --> 45:23.162
That you were carrying?

45:29.082 --> 45:30.562
(BRIDA) No.

You didn't see it in your dreams,

to create a tall shield wall.

46:59.482 --> 47:03.322
First row crouches lower,
protecting the lower body and legs.

The second row reaches forward,
protecting the upper body.

47:07.562 --> 47:12.522

48:10.402 --> 48:13.122
- Brida.
- What of her?

48:14.442 --> 48:16.602
I'm no seer,

48:16.762 --> 48:18.362
but I'd say she's unhappy.

48:19.882 --> 48:23.242
She prefers the company of Danes
to Saxons,

48:23.402 --> 48:24.722
nothing wrong in that.

48:25.722 --> 48:27.482
She's been with the wrong Saxons.

48:28.042 --> 48:31.242
- The Danes have a hunger for life.
- Don't we all?

48:32.242 --> 48:33.842
Alfred...

48:35.642 --> 48:37.802
He's serious.

48:38.162 --> 48:40.682
A pious bastard.

48:40.842 --> 48:42.442
Dislike him, by all means,

48:42.602 --> 48:45.202
but never underestimate him.

48:45.602 --> 48:47.242
He's ruthless,

48:47.402 --> 48:50.122
and the man thinks,

48:50.282 --> 48:52.442
which is more than you or I could do.

48:52.602 --> 48:54.442
Leofric the warrior,

48:55.162 --> 48:56.482
may I sit with you?

48:56.642 --> 48:58.322
No, you may not.

48:58.482 --> 49:00.762
Do the monks know you're missing?

49:02.002 --> 49:05.682
Uhtred, this is Aethelwold,
another arseling.

49:06.522 --> 49:10.282
- Nephew of the king.
- No, I am not the nephew of the king.

49:10.442 --> 49:13.562
I am the king.

49:14.282 --> 49:15.762
But Alfred likes to pretend,

49:15.922 --> 49:18.642
and every bastard appears
to be happy with the lie. Heh, heh.

49:21.242 --> 49:23.642
- What are we talking about?
- Alfred.

49:23.802 --> 49:26.522
He will not allow me to fight.
Have I told you that?

49:26.682 --> 49:28.322
- Many times.
- Well, it's true.

49:28.482 --> 49:30.122
He will not allow me to fight.

49:30.282 --> 49:33.362
I would like you, warrior Leofric,

49:33.522 --> 49:37.842
to teach me how to fight
and I shall teach you how to...

49:38.002 --> 49:41.082
- (LEOFRIC) Go on.
- You will not forget to pay for this.

49:41.962 --> 49:43.402
Have I ever?

49:43.562 --> 49:45.522
Once or twice.

50:18.242 --> 50:19.962
I like God.

50:20.682 --> 50:22.482
(CHICKENS CLUCKING)

50:25.122 --> 50:27.242
(UHTRED CLUCKING)

50:41.242 --> 50:43.242
(DOOR OPENING)

50:48.682 --> 50:50.242
Silver.

50:50.962 --> 50:52.402
Yes.

50:52.562 --> 50:54.202
Why?

50:56.162 --> 50:58.922
- You leaving me.
- Are you drunk?

51:00.522 --> 51:02.402
Maybe a little.

51:02.562 --> 51:05.242
We will give the silver
to young Ragnar.

51:06.642 --> 51:08.282
Tomorrow.

51:08.442 --> 51:10.402
Dusk.

51:12.362 --> 51:13.722
He's here.

51:14.922 --> 51:17.082
We can tell him the truth,

51:17.922 --> 51:20.482
and we can join Ragnar and his men.

51:27.642 --> 51:32.962
I need men bound to me by God, by duty,
by the land, by Wessex itself.

51:33.682 --> 51:37.202
I would again like to put to Uhtred
the prospect of marriage.

51:37.362 --> 51:40.162
- To my goddaughter?
- To Mildrith, yes.

51:41.242 --> 51:43.642
Well, it would certainly bind him
to the land,

51:43.802 --> 51:45.762
and indirectly to the church, to God.

51:45.922 --> 51:48.682
- It would test him.
- It would.

51:48.842 --> 51:51.282
You would be in favour still?

51:51.442 --> 51:52.842
Of course.

51:53.002 --> 51:54.602
Anything for Wessex.

52:08.842 --> 52:11.802
Uhtred Ragnarson is a good man to be.

52:13.482 --> 52:14.962
Look at me.

52:15.122 --> 52:17.122
You owe Alfred nothing.

52:17.282 --> 52:20.322
To him, your word means nothing,
you are a pagan.

52:20.482 --> 52:22.162
Please.

52:30.962 --> 52:35.762
Uhtred Ragnarson can never become
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

52:38.922 --> 52:40.482
Never.

52:42.482 --> 52:44.522
(RUSTLING)

52:50.922 --> 52:52.842
Did you kill my father?

52:53.882 --> 52:55.202
You need to ask?

52:55.362 --> 52:58.162
Did you kill my family?

52:58.322 --> 52:59.642
(BRIDA) He didn't.

52:59.802 --> 53:02.242
I am speaking with Uhtred.

53:04.802 --> 53:08.402
I won't ask a second time.

53:13.042 --> 53:15.762
If you believe that I would
kill our father,

53:15.922 --> 53:18.002
our mother,

53:18.162 --> 53:19.962
and ourfamily...

53:23.282 --> 53:25.442
take your revenge.

53:33.322 --> 53:34.962
I knew it.

53:36.042 --> 53:37.642
I knew it.

53:38.882 --> 53:40.362
I had to be sure, I knew it.

53:47.362 --> 53:49.362
It was Kjartan.

53:49.762 --> 53:51.962
Kjartan attacked and set the fire.

53:52.122 --> 53:55.002
- If we could have saved them, we would.
- I knew it.

53:55.162 --> 53:57.322
I didn't believe a word I was hearing.

53:57.482 --> 54:00.002
(UHTRED) We have Ragnar's wealth.

54:00.162 --> 54:02.082
We kept it for you.

54:03.762 --> 54:07.322
- Brida. A fully grown woman now.
- (BRIDA) Heh, heh, heh.

54:13.562 --> 54:17.002
I've seen this moment in my dreams
so many times.

54:19.882 --> 54:24.082
So Kjartan's story is that the English
rose against our father,

54:24.242 --> 54:26.602
encouraged by you.

54:27.962 --> 54:31.282
He claims to have revenged himself
for the killers.

54:32.362 --> 54:34.482
Did you ever believe him?

54:35.042 --> 54:36.402
(RAGNAR CHUCKLES)

54:36.562 --> 54:38.282
Never.

54:39.042 --> 54:40.802
But he is Lord Kjartan now.

54:40.962 --> 54:44.882
He has three times the men,
and the ear of Ubba.

54:47.682 --> 54:49.162
<i>Hm.</i>

54:49.842 --> 54:52.922
When I kill him,
it will need to be planned.

54:53.562 --> 54:55.522
When we kill him.

54:56.562 --> 54:59.322
- It will be dangerous.
- (RAGNAR) It must be done.

54:59.482 --> 55:01.962
Ragnar, we're with you.

55:03.722 --> 55:06.282
Then you will sail with me?

55:08.322 --> 55:09.882
I Will.

55:11.322 --> 55:14.082
I have sworn to Alfred.

55:14.682 --> 55:16.402
It means nothing.

55:19.362 --> 55:21.682
Well, if you have sworn...

55:24.082 --> 55:26.402
then you must keep your word.

55:36.962 --> 55:40.002
I need this revenge like I need water.

55:40.922 --> 55:44.322
When the time is right,
I swear I will be with you.

55:45.242 --> 55:47.122
I know.

55:55.522 --> 55:58.482
I can't believe I'm about
to let you go.

55:59.402 --> 56:01.162
Lose you.

56:04.122 --> 56:06.802
You have been half my life.

56:09.402 --> 56:11.842
All of my madness.

56:22.402 --> 56:24.162
Be haPPY-

56:52.002 --> 56:54.402
(LEOFRIC) I take it she has gone then?

56:57.322 --> 57:00.322
I'm guessing that's it's Alfred
that kept you here.

57:01.602 --> 57:03.722
I sold myself.

57:04.922 --> 57:07.482
For a mail coat and helmet.

57:08.082 --> 57:11.082
That's what we do, we sell ourselves.

57:15.282 --> 57:17.002
This year,

57:17.402 --> 57:21.082
what you've giving to Alfred,
it's not about a mail coat.

57:21.242 --> 57:23.162
It's about you.

57:23.642 --> 57:26.122
The bastard thinks, didn't I say?

57:30.362 --> 57:33.002
He wants more than a year's service.

57:33.482 --> 57:36.482
He wants you to help
take back England.

57:36.882 --> 57:38.642
All of England.

57:40.762 --> 57:44.162
Of course, when the year's up,
you could go back to the Danes.

57:44.922 --> 57:47.882
That would at least
give me the chance to kill you.

57:50.442 --> 57:52.282
But what would you be?

57:53.922 --> 57:55.842
Who would you be?
