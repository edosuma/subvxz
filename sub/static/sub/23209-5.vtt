00:53.570 --> 00:55.839
Hello?

01:03.613 --> 01:05.482
Who is that?

01:39.449 --> 01:41.685
Are you Ghouli?

01:41.718 --> 01:45.255
No, you are.

01:45.289 --> 01:47.291
No... I'm not. I swear.

01:47.324 --> 01:49.092
That's what Ghouli would say.

01:49.125 --> 01:51.461
You're trying to trick me.

01:51.495 --> 01:53.963
Look. I can prove it.

01:53.997 --> 01:56.366
Just stay where you are.
I'll come find you.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.402
Not if I find you first.

03:08.446 --> 03:11.448

03:15.379 --> 03:17.447
Most people believe
there are two states

03:17.481 --> 03:18.782
of consciousness:

03:18.815 --> 03:22.286
Sleep and wakefulness.

03:22.319 --> 03:24.421
But there is a third state...

03:24.454 --> 03:28.392
hypnagogia... characterized
by dreamlike visions

03:28.425 --> 03:31.628
and strange
sensory perceptions.

03:31.661 --> 03:33.863
It was in this borderland

03:33.897 --> 03:35.732
that I found myself frozen

03:35.765 --> 03:38.167
on a stranger's bed.

04:24.814 --> 04:27.484
What the hell is going on?

04:27.517 --> 04:29.686
It sounds like sleep paralysis.

04:29.719 --> 04:31.921
REM atonia.
Did you hear a hissing,

04:31.955 --> 04:33.089
or a, or a buzzing?

04:33.122 --> 04:34.458
Did you feel an electric current

04:34.491 --> 04:36.326
running through your body?

04:36.360 --> 04:37.994
No, it was different, Mulder.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.864
I mean, after the-the initial
jolt of fear,

04:40.897 --> 04:43.967
I-I felt compelled to follow
the dark figure.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.969
Hmm. Dark figures are usually
meant to be avoided.

04:46.002 --> 04:47.837
Where was it leading you?

04:53.410 --> 04:54.744
There.

05:03.186 --> 05:05.622
That's the same boat.

05:05.655 --> 05:08.758
That's an open
X-file, Scully.

05:10.093 --> 05:12.328
Chimera.

05:18.602 --> 05:20.904
"Dreams are today's answers
to tomorrow's questions."

05:20.937 --> 05:23.740
That's a quote from Edgar Cayce.

05:23.773 --> 05:25.909
He was called
the "sleeping prophet."

05:25.942 --> 05:28.912
Like you, he received visions
in a hypnogogic state.

05:28.945 --> 05:31.147
And he believed those visions
were messages sent.

05:31.180 --> 05:33.750
He also believed in
the lost city of Atlantis.

05:33.783 --> 05:35.719
Another reason to love the guy.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.054
You've been receiving visions
through seizure.

05:38.087 --> 05:40.323
Maybe this is an evolution
of the form.

05:40.356 --> 05:43.760
No, but you're onto something,
Scully. I'm sure of it.

05:44.694 --> 05:46.262
We're being followed.

05:46.295 --> 05:48.097
Since the airport.

05:56.072 --> 05:57.907
Hi. Detective Costa.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.676
- Agent Scully. -Agent Mulder.
- Pleasure.

05:59.709 --> 06:01.377
So, the victims
and the perpetrators

06:01.411 --> 06:02.912
were two female
high school seniors.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.280
Different schools.

06:04.313 --> 06:05.615
No past criminal history.

06:05.649 --> 06:07.083
They were good students.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.718
Uh, we talked to their
respective families

06:08.752 --> 06:10.186
and checked their social media.

06:10.219 --> 06:11.588
No indications that the girls
knew each other

06:11.621 --> 06:13.189
before the attack.

06:13.222 --> 06:15.058
The crime scene photos
indicate that the wounds

06:15.091 --> 06:16.860
were made with
a sharp bladed instrument.

06:16.893 --> 06:18.528
We found two knives
at the scene.

06:18.562 --> 06:20.430
They, uh, they cut each other up
pretty bad.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.098
What's the condition
of the girls now?

06:22.131 --> 06:23.433
Both lost a lot of blood.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.801
Uh, the one, Brianna Stapleton,

06:24.834 --> 06:26.470
was, like, a millimeter away

06:26.503 --> 06:29.038
from having her carotid artery
severed in the fight.

06:29.072 --> 06:30.907
Now, both girls are unconscious
in the hospital,

06:30.940 --> 06:32.976
but doctors are confident
they'll pull through.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.314
Who reported the attack?

06:38.347 --> 06:39.983
An anonymous 911 call.

06:40.016 --> 06:41.485
Didn't leave a name, but, uh,

06:41.518 --> 06:44.120
the voice was male,
and he sounded panicked.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.822
Forensics has a complete workup
on the scene

06:45.855 --> 06:47.290
with pictures and measurements,

06:47.323 --> 06:50.159
but, uh, this was left
otherwise untouched.

06:50.193 --> 06:52.662
There's no blood
leading to or from the spot

06:52.696 --> 06:55.064
where they were discovered.

06:55.098 --> 06:57.601
Seems like once they started,
they were gonna finish.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.104
Mulder, the way these girls

07:01.137 --> 07:03.072
attacked each other indicates

07:03.106 --> 07:04.941
and extreme emotional response.

07:04.974 --> 07:06.976
It suggests to me that
they did know each other.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.411
But if they didn't know
each other,

07:08.444 --> 07:10.747
that same response
could be an indication

07:10.780 --> 07:14.317
of extreme fear,
like a lizard brain thing.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.985
But either way, this meeting

07:16.019 --> 07:18.421
was certainly not a coincidence.

07:24.393 --> 07:26.663
All right. Okay, thanks.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.097
Hey, guys.

07:28.131 --> 07:29.999
There was one other thing.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.168
The EMT said that
he heard something

07:32.201 --> 07:33.870
when he was treating
the victims.

07:33.903 --> 07:37.741
He said that the girls asked him
if he found Ghouli.

07:43.412 --> 07:45.048
Is that Ghouli with an "H"?

07:45.081 --> 07:47.016
It's typical.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.552
Teeth, mucous.

07:48.585 --> 07:52.221
Ghouli probably feeds
on human flesh. Yawn.

07:52.255 --> 07:53.857
Well, the site's
only been active

07:53.890 --> 07:55.324
for the last couple of months.

07:55.358 --> 07:57.193
Mostly fan fiction.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.228
Yeah, this is my problem with
modern-day monsters, Scully.

07:59.262 --> 08:01.030
There's no chance
for emotional investment.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.399
You know, like Frankenstein
and the Wolf man. -

08:03.432 --> 08:05.234
Not only did they inspire
bowel-clenching fear,

08:05.268 --> 08:07.036
but there was pathos.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.505
You know, Frankenstein...
he was afraid of fire

08:09.539 --> 08:11.708
and he just wanted a friend.
You know?

08:11.741 --> 08:14.377
There's a lot of money to be
made in scaring people. -Mm.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.813
Maybe the girls were manipulated
to attack each other

08:16.846 --> 08:18.414
in order to goose traffic.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.586
Most of the stories
are written by an @Rever.

08:25.789 --> 08:28.257
Ah. The girls
have regained consciousness.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.660
We can talk to them
at the hospital now.

08:30.694 --> 08:32.428
Bob.
Double shot cappuccino,

08:32.461 --> 08:34.030
- extra foam.
- Yes, thank you.

08:34.063 --> 08:36.065
- No worries, buddy.
- Bob?

08:36.099 --> 08:39.068
Like I wanted to explain "Fox"
for the millionth time?

08:39.102 --> 08:41.370
Ghouli's real.

08:41.404 --> 08:43.907
I saw it. It was closer
than you are to me.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.408
I was scared.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.076
- I had to defend myself.
- The thing

08:47.110 --> 08:49.746
was an inch from my face.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.015
So close I could smell
its breath.

08:52.048 --> 08:54.183
It had rows of sharp teeth,

08:54.217 --> 08:59.088
and this goo was dripping
from its mouth.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.523
Well, what did it smell like?
Its breath.

09:00.556 --> 09:03.226
Like cinnamon.

09:03.259 --> 09:05.094
And how did you find
this Ghouli?

09:05.128 --> 09:07.631
I fell into this hole,
into its lair, I guess.

09:07.664 --> 09:09.633
I heard something jump down,

09:09.666 --> 09:12.902
and when I turned around,
it was screaming.

09:12.936 --> 09:14.738
What about Brianna Stapleton?

09:14.771 --> 09:16.973
I didn't see anybody else.

09:17.006 --> 09:20.276
She was on the floor,
next to you, also injured.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.746
I don't know any Sarah.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.748
Okay? All I saw was Ghouli.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.950
So, how did you know
to go to the ferry?

09:26.983 --> 09:29.285
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.655
I had a dream.

09:31.688 --> 09:33.990
But it wasn't a dream.

09:34.023 --> 09:36.092
It felt real, like I was really
living it.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.294
And at first it was scary,
because I couldn't move.

09:38.327 --> 09:41.430
Like I was in bed,
but it wasn't my own bed.

09:41.464 --> 09:43.299
Someone was next to me,
but I couldn't see him.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.668
It was just a dark figure.

09:44.701 --> 09:47.003
And I jumped out of bed and...

09:47.036 --> 09:48.905
chased him.

09:48.938 --> 09:50.573
It wasn't even my own house.

09:50.606 --> 09:52.141
I would run through the hallways

09:52.175 --> 09:54.644
and try to get to
the living room to get outside,

09:54.678 --> 09:57.446
and I would just end up back
inside again. -Like a maze.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.983
Where no matter
which door you open,

10:00.016 --> 10:01.685
you end up in the same place.

10:01.718 --> 10:04.153
Was there something inside the
house you were supposed to see?

10:04.187 --> 10:05.521
A souvenir.

10:05.554 --> 10:07.456
Yeah. You shake it and it snows.

10:07.490 --> 10:09.425
What was inside your snow globe?

10:09.458 --> 10:10.927
The ferry.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.697
Everybody knew where it was.

10:13.730 --> 10:16.866
Kids would get stoned on it
in the summer.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.368
Not me.

10:19.402 --> 10:21.270
Have you ever experienced

10:21.304 --> 10:23.506
- a dream like that before?
- Kind of.

10:23.539 --> 10:27.510
My boyfriend and I did this
fun house thing at the fair.

10:27.543 --> 10:28.878
You have a boyfriend?

10:28.912 --> 10:31.614
I'm-I'm not supposed to.

10:31.647 --> 10:33.683
My parents don't approve.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.054
They're really lame, but...

10:38.087 --> 10:39.756
he's cool.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.492
What's his name?

10:43.526 --> 10:45.528
Jackson Van de Kamp.

10:45.561 --> 10:49.032
Jackson... Van de Kamp.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.537
The sleep paralysis.
The labyrinth.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.572
The snow globe.
You share the same story.

10:56.605 --> 10:58.541
And the girls, apparently,
the same boyfriend...

10:58.574 --> 11:00.076
Jackson Van de Kamp.

11:00.109 --> 11:02.145
- Scully...
- I know.

11:02.178 --> 11:04.013
Mulder, it has
to be a coincidence.

11:04.047 --> 11:05.815
No, it's not.
You were sent here.

11:05.849 --> 11:07.350
We are meant to be here.

11:07.383 --> 11:09.552
We got to find out
where this kid lives.

11:28.805 --> 11:32.075
I feel like
I'm gonna fall off a cliff.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.030
Mulder.

11:54.063 --> 11:56.432
This is the house in my visions.

11:59.435 --> 12:01.637
Door's open.

12:01.670 --> 12:03.139
Scully.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.582
All right, so you, uh...

12:46.615 --> 12:48.617
you said you heard three shots?

12:48.651 --> 12:50.353
Murder-suicide.
Jackson Van de Kamp...

12:50.386 --> 12:52.121
he killed his parents.

12:52.155 --> 12:55.024
Then when he heard you and Agent
Scully break into the house,

12:55.058 --> 12:57.593
he realized he was gonna
get caught, and killed himself.

12:57.626 --> 12:59.195
That's a rather
convenient explanation.

12:59.228 --> 13:00.830
Well, the kid
had two girlfriends

13:00.864 --> 13:02.765
who tried to kill each other
just the other night.

13:02.798 --> 13:04.500
I mean, there's something dirty
in the water already.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.435
The back door was wide open
when we got here.

13:06.469 --> 13:07.937
Hell, maybe he left it open.

13:07.971 --> 13:09.472
I don't think
you worry about those details

13:09.505 --> 13:12.208
when you're looking
to commit murder-suicide.

13:12.241 --> 13:14.010
I mean, you were here,
Agent Mulder.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.445
There was nobody else in the
house when he killed himself.

13:16.479 --> 13:18.814
So, look, I appreciate
your expertise, but I think

13:18.848 --> 13:21.217
you're trying to find answers to
questions nobody else is asking.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.352
I appreciate your input.

13:25.821 --> 13:27.323
Scully?

13:38.868 --> 13:40.303
Scully?

13:47.110 --> 13:49.012
Scully?

13:52.348 --> 13:54.250
This is his room.

13:54.283 --> 13:56.485
I recognize it from my dream.

13:56.519 --> 13:59.022
You're right, Mulder.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.457
Whoever he is,
he wanted me to be here.

14:03.192 --> 14:06.495
Look.

14:06.529 --> 14:08.264
Birthday, Halloween,

14:08.297 --> 14:12.201
vacation, baseball.

14:12.235 --> 14:14.203
It's a whole life.

14:18.141 --> 14:20.944
It's full, and it's still cold.

14:22.311 --> 14:24.680
Odd choice
to crack open a can of soda

14:24.713 --> 14:27.083
before you decide
to kill your parents.

14:33.322 --> 14:35.591
Yes.

14:35.624 --> 14:38.894
Memoirs
of a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing.

14:40.263 --> 14:42.898
At least he had
his priorities straight.

14:42.932 --> 14:45.801
He was troubled,
maybe even schizophrenic.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.570
He was seeing a psychiatrist.

14:47.603 --> 14:50.373
Clozapine...
that's an antipsychotic,

14:50.406 --> 14:51.874
and diazepam is
to treat seizures.

14:51.907 --> 14:53.809
They were prescribed
two months ago,

14:53.842 --> 14:56.779
and they're still full,
so he was off his medication.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.647
I have grave doubts
about what appears

14:58.681 --> 15:01.084
to have happened here, Scully.

15:06.255 --> 15:07.423
Huh.

15:07.456 --> 15:09.092
- Malcolm X.
- "The future

15:09.125 --> 15:11.327
belongs to those
who prepare for it today."

15:11.360 --> 15:13.963
Was that his hero?

15:13.997 --> 15:17.566
We don't know that
that body is William, Scully.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.969
Mm.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.240
Malcolm Little
took the last name "X"

15:24.273 --> 15:26.109
because he wouldn't take
the slave name

15:26.142 --> 15:29.178
given to his ancestral family.

15:29.212 --> 15:33.816
Was Jackson's identity so adrift
that he couldn't see himself

15:33.849 --> 15:36.519
as being a part of a family?

15:36.552 --> 15:39.989
Is that why he killed
his parents and then himself?

15:40.023 --> 15:42.858
Why would he call you here
just to see him die?

15:42.891 --> 15:46.029
I need to get proof
of his identity, Mulder.

15:47.396 --> 15:49.332
I need answers.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.307
I'll get you one.

16:39.582 --> 16:43.086
Who the hell are you with,
and why are you following me?

16:43.119 --> 16:45.154
Take it easy.
Nobody's following you.

16:45.188 --> 16:46.855
We're just curious onlookers.

16:46.889 --> 16:49.525
Yeah. We saw the police cars.
Something bad happened here.

16:49.558 --> 16:51.260
What agency are you with?

16:51.294 --> 16:53.929
Judging by your crappy rental
car, I'm guessing the DoD.

16:53.962 --> 16:55.398
You make a lot of assumptions.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.032
I'm also gonna assume
it's no coincidence

16:57.066 --> 16:59.535
you're here on the night
the Van de Kamps are killed.

16:59.568 --> 17:02.438
Wow. Three bodies.

17:02.471 --> 17:05.608
- What a tragedy.
- Yeah.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.178
Keep cracking wise.

17:09.212 --> 17:11.714
You have no idea
my state of mind.

18:12.541 --> 18:14.443
I don't know if you are

18:14.477 --> 18:16.945
who I think you might be.

18:19.715 --> 18:22.218
But if you are William...

18:25.154 --> 18:28.424
this is what I'd say.

18:28.457 --> 18:32.027
I'm sorry.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.463
I'm so sorry

18:34.497 --> 18:37.633
that I didn't get a chance
to know you.

18:37.666 --> 18:41.404
Or you get a chance to know me,
or your father.

18:46.074 --> 18:48.511
I gave you up for adoption,

18:48.544 --> 18:51.280
not because I didn't want you,

18:51.314 --> 18:54.417
or because you were
any less loved.

18:56.219 --> 18:59.021
I was trying to keep you safe.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.424
I hope you know that.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.728
Uh, and maybe...

19:05.761 --> 19:09.632
maybe I should have had
the courage to stand by you.

19:09.665 --> 19:13.168
But I thought
I was being strong,

19:13.202 --> 19:15.804
because it was the hardest thing
I've ever done.

19:17.740 --> 19:21.477
I mean...

19:21.510 --> 19:24.012
to let go.

19:24.046 --> 19:26.882
And to know that...

19:26.915 --> 19:30.586
I was gonna miss
your whole life.

19:32.455 --> 19:35.524
But it turns out
that this is the hardest thing.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.362
To see the outcome.

19:40.696 --> 19:43.098
And how I failed you.

19:47.870 --> 19:51.073
I... need you to know

19:51.106 --> 19:54.410
that I never forgot you.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.346
And I thought,

19:57.380 --> 19:59.748
I felt that...

19:59.782 --> 20:02.618
even recently,
that we were gonna somehow...

20:04.787 --> 20:06.589
be reunited.

20:06.622 --> 20:10.659
I wish I could have
been there to ease your pain.

20:12.728 --> 20:15.130
Oh, my God,
this is so inadequate.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.735
I'm just so sorry.

20:20.936 --> 20:22.571
I'm so sorry.

20:33.916 --> 20:36.118
Have you been there
the whole time?

20:36.151 --> 20:38.621
No, but I heard enough.

20:40.789 --> 20:43.191
You have nothing
to apologize for.

20:51.767 --> 20:54.603
This is torture, Mulder.

20:54.637 --> 20:58.474
I need to get the results.

20:58.507 --> 21:02.177
Okay. We can use the lab here
and get a DNA comparison.

21:02.210 --> 21:03.846
- Okay.
- They'll be back in two hours.

21:03.879 --> 21:06.449
Yeah.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.651
Respiratory
therapist to the ICU.

21:42.685 --> 21:44.887
Any available respiratory
therapist to the ICU, stat.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.865
William.

22:30.365 --> 22:33.569
Is this a message for me?

22:33.602 --> 22:36.371
Or am I sending a message
to you?

22:45.047 --> 22:46.949
Agent Scully.

22:52.721 --> 22:55.290
I'm Dr. Harris, the coroner.

22:55.323 --> 22:57.159
Where did you put the body?

23:04.232 --> 23:07.570
There's no sign
anyone was ever in here.

23:07.603 --> 23:10.706
Scully, can I have a word?

23:10.739 --> 23:12.140
It's okay, Mulder.

23:12.174 --> 23:14.376
- It's not good news.
- I know.

23:14.409 --> 23:16.579
It's William.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.046
- His body's missing.
- There's no way

23:18.080 --> 23:20.115
anyone could have taken a body
out of here.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.151
Are there any windows anywhere?

23:26.254 --> 23:28.957
No sign of damage
on the outside.

23:28.991 --> 23:31.460
That window's always locked.

23:31.494 --> 23:34.830
Well, then it must have been
opened from the inside.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.775
Scully.

23:48.443 --> 23:50.412
Can I talk to you?

23:50.445 --> 23:51.680
Yeah.

23:54.349 --> 23:56.418
I know what you're thinking.

23:56.451 --> 23:59.421
And I want him to be alive
every bit as much as you do.

23:59.454 --> 24:02.691
And in my heart,
I never thought that we'd...

24:02.725 --> 24:05.127
have to face this moment, but...

24:05.160 --> 24:08.296
here we are.

24:08.330 --> 24:10.933
Hope is not a fact.

24:10.966 --> 24:13.869
And I'm always the first to
jump to extreme possibilities,

24:13.902 --> 24:15.771
but this is not
as simple as that.

24:15.804 --> 24:18.807
Mulder, I had another vision.

24:18.841 --> 24:22.044
And I saw this.

24:22.077 --> 24:24.813
Did you take that from his room?

24:26.348 --> 24:28.283
I don't know why I did.

24:28.316 --> 24:31.987
I just needed to hold on
to something tangible.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.722
All right.

24:33.756 --> 24:36.725
I'll check
the video surveillance.

24:36.759 --> 24:39.394
But this doesn't change
anything.

24:39.427 --> 24:40.896
Not yet.

24:40.929 --> 24:43.732
He wants us to find him, Mulder.

24:43.766 --> 24:46.569
I know it.

24:56.779 --> 24:57.880
- I'm sorry.
- Oh!

24:57.913 --> 24:59.314
I'm sorry.

24:59.347 --> 25:01.016
It-it cracked.

25:01.049 --> 25:03.819
The... stuff leaked out.

25:03.852 --> 25:05.721
No, it's-it's my fault.
I'm sorry.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.523
It's okay. You were distracted.

25:11.727 --> 25:14.797
You like... windmills?

25:17.633 --> 25:19.802
I like this one.

25:21.303 --> 25:22.938
Who are you?

25:22.971 --> 25:25.407
Don't give up
on the bigger picture.

25:46.561 --> 25:49.264
- Nothing
on the surveillance cameras

25:49.297 --> 25:52.601
and nothing here... no history
on ghouli.net, no porn.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.937
How many 17-year-olds
with two girlfriends

25:54.970 --> 25:56.939
have a search history
that clean?

25:56.972 --> 25:58.140
Maybe he wiped his history.

25:58.173 --> 25:59.742
I got this from the dark web.

25:59.775 --> 26:03.445
It retrieves the browser history
from the hard drive.

26:03.478 --> 26:04.947
If we can find
the right computer.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.581
He's hiding it here somewhere.

26:09.317 --> 26:12.187
Our investigation
is about to get hijacked.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.999
Got it.

26:25.533 --> 26:28.470
Teenage girls have secrets, too.

26:32.875 --> 26:34.677
Look at that.

26:34.710 --> 26:36.679
Hundreds of posts to ghouli.net.

26:36.712 --> 26:40.115
And a back door
to some files of the DoD.

26:40.148 --> 26:41.616
Agents Mulder and Scully!

26:41.650 --> 26:44.286
We are commanding you
to cease all activity

26:44.319 --> 26:47.790
and exit the property
immediately!

26:47.823 --> 26:50.525
The FBI has jurisdiction over
this investigation. I suggest

26:50.558 --> 26:52.360
you leave the premises
until I can get an order

26:52.394 --> 26:54.462
from a countermanding authority.

26:54.496 --> 26:56.965
Straight from the DoJ.

26:56.999 --> 26:59.001
Now scram.

27:03.739 --> 27:06.641
Step away from the desk.

27:06.675 --> 27:08.043
Everything in this house
is now under

27:08.076 --> 27:09.511
the jurisdiction of the DoD.

27:11.747 --> 27:13.548
Oh!

27:13.581 --> 27:16.551
Never a good idea to keep
an open beverage by electronics.

27:20.188 --> 27:22.224
Mulder, how is it possible
the only updates I've received

27:22.257 --> 27:23.892
about what you're doing
come through complaints

27:23.926 --> 27:26.061
by other agencies
in the government?

27:26.094 --> 27:29.197
- Let me guess, DoD.
- And the DoJ.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.699
They filed a memo
documenting obstruction

27:30.733 --> 27:32.134
and tampering with evidence.

27:32.167 --> 27:33.468
Nothing will come
of those complaints,

27:33.501 --> 27:35.470
because the DOD
is intimately involved

27:35.503 --> 27:38.206
in a conspiracy they themselves
are trying to cover up.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.042
Does it have anything to do
with a missing dead body,

27:40.075 --> 27:41.509
a Jackson Van de Kamp?

27:41.543 --> 27:43.145
I'll tell you more
when I know more.

27:43.178 --> 27:44.679
Mulder, I think
you need to come back here

27:44.713 --> 27:46.148
so we can discuss
your activities.

27:46.181 --> 27:48.583
No, actually,
you're gonna need to come here.

27:48.616 --> 27:51.253
I'm not going to Norfolk,
Mulder. -Bob? -Skinner,

27:51.286 --> 27:53.188
you're breaking up. I can,
I can barely hear you. -Bob?

27:53.221 --> 27:55.190
- Mulder... -Uh...
- Double cappuccino, extra foam?

27:55.223 --> 27:57.025
Oh. Bob. Yeah, yeah.

27:57.059 --> 27:58.493
Mulder,
I can hear you perfectly.

27:58.526 --> 27:59.594
Uh, I'm gonna have
to call you back

27:59.627 --> 28:00.863
when I get a better connection,
all right?

28:00.896 --> 28:02.364
Hello? Hello?

28:02.397 --> 28:04.733
Mulder?

28:13.241 --> 28:15.944
Mulder is close.

28:15.978 --> 28:19.948
I suspect he'll be interested
in Project Crossroads.

28:19.982 --> 28:23.418
We'll be able to find
what we've been looking for.

28:31.659 --> 28:33.628
Mulder, why did you want
to meet out here?

28:33.661 --> 28:35.898
It's cold and it smells.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.966
This is where it all started.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.068
When two young girls
were attacked by a monster

28:40.102 --> 28:41.970
only they could see.

28:42.004 --> 28:43.605
You're wrong.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.440
This is the end of the road.

28:45.473 --> 28:47.709
It started decades ago, when
they decided to combine alien

28:47.742 --> 28:49.711
and human DNA to create hybrids.

28:49.744 --> 28:52.047
Listen to me.
I came out here to warn you

28:52.080 --> 28:54.649
and Scully...
drop this investigation.

28:56.418 --> 28:58.553
I'm listening.

28:58.586 --> 29:00.155
After the crash at Roswell,

29:00.188 --> 29:01.990
our government's interest
in alien technology

29:02.024 --> 29:03.992
exploded in all directions.

29:04.026 --> 29:05.627
And finally, in the '70s,

29:05.660 --> 29:07.462
our science caught up
to our ambition.

29:07.495 --> 29:10.933
A eugenics program was initiated
by a Dr. Masao Matsumoto

29:10.966 --> 29:14.502
using components of
alien technology, hybrid DNA.

29:14.536 --> 29:17.840
Project Crossroads.
I read the report.

29:17.873 --> 29:19.641
It was ultimately deemed
a failure because

29:19.674 --> 29:22.244
they couldn't predict what
attributes the test subjects

29:22.277 --> 29:23.645
would get from the hybrid DNA.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.147
That's correct.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.915
The project was defunded
15 years ago.

29:26.949 --> 29:29.517
Dr. Matsumoto burned all the
files pertaining to the subjects

29:29.551 --> 29:32.787
to save their lives,
and then... he disappeared.

29:32.821 --> 29:36.091
The DoD has tried to
track them down ever since.

29:36.124 --> 29:38.260
That's why they were
following us.

29:38.293 --> 29:39.962
We found one of their own
for them.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.130
Jackson Van de Kamp.

29:42.164 --> 29:43.999
Now do you understand?

29:44.032 --> 29:47.702
Jackson Van de Kamp
was our son, Skinner.

29:47.735 --> 29:49.771
He was named William
before he was adopted.

29:49.804 --> 29:53.708
I checked his DNA
against Scully's.

29:53.741 --> 29:57.479
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
Mulder, I di... I...

29:57.512 --> 30:00.348
Thank you...

30:00.382 --> 30:02.684
for your warning.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.687
It just came too late.

30:22.905 --> 30:25.073
I find it hard to believe

30:25.107 --> 30:27.709
that Jackson would harm anyone,
much less his parents.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.978
He loved them very much.

30:30.012 --> 30:32.847
And we never discussed
any suicidal ideation.

30:32.881 --> 30:35.717
Your-your claims don't describe
the patient I know.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.419
You prescribed medication
for seizures.

30:37.452 --> 30:39.487
Jackson had symptoms
that coincided

30:39.521 --> 30:41.924
with extreme electrical activity
in the brain.

30:41.957 --> 30:46.929
But can you tell me,
did he have... visions?

30:46.962 --> 30:49.064
What he saw was...

30:49.097 --> 30:52.334
specific and detailed.

30:52.367 --> 30:55.003
That's all I'm willing to say,
Agent Scully,

30:55.037 --> 30:56.871
unless you come back
with a court order.

30:56.905 --> 30:59.574
His visions were apocalyptic.

31:01.276 --> 31:04.379
A pandemic was spreading
across America.

31:04.412 --> 31:06.781
Hospitals were overwhelmed.

31:06.814 --> 31:10.452
People were panicking.

31:10.485 --> 31:13.888
A vaccine was needed.

31:13.922 --> 31:17.425
One that had to be created
with a combination

31:17.459 --> 31:20.128
of human and alien DNA.

31:20.162 --> 31:22.764
And Jackson himself was the key.

31:22.797 --> 31:26.901
It ends with a UFO hovering

31:26.935 --> 31:30.805
over the 14th Street Bridge.

31:30.838 --> 31:34.642
That's what he saw, Dr. Scholz.

31:36.511 --> 31:39.247
H-How is it possible you know?

31:45.520 --> 31:47.722
So, you think
a shared vision means

31:47.755 --> 31:49.924
that it's more likely
to come true?

31:49.958 --> 31:52.894
What if I didn't get
a glimpse of the future?

31:52.927 --> 31:56.431
What if I was just a receptacle
for his message to me?

31:56.464 --> 31:59.301
Just like my dream to come here.

31:59.334 --> 32:02.470
Hey, Bob.

32:02.504 --> 32:06.508
It's an alternate reality... Fox
doesn't exist in coffee shops.

32:06.541 --> 32:07.976
No.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.012
It's a false reality, Scully.

32:10.045 --> 32:11.813
Just like everything
we've seen so far.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.282
I've been going over
the forensics of the case.

32:14.316 --> 32:15.617
The police think that
Jackson killed his parents,

32:15.650 --> 32:17.019
then himself,

32:17.052 --> 32:19.187
but the spatter pattern
tells me different.

32:19.221 --> 32:21.156
It tells me
there were two shooters.

32:27.962 --> 32:29.664
Her body was moved
after she was shot

32:29.697 --> 32:32.267
to make it look like
there was one shooter.

32:32.300 --> 32:34.436
Scully, I believe that,
through the Smoking Man,

32:34.469 --> 32:36.538
you were an unwitting
participant

32:36.571 --> 32:39.474
in a eugenics program
called Project Crossroads.

32:39.507 --> 32:41.976
It was spearheaded
by Dr. Masao Matsumoto.

32:42.010 --> 32:45.347
He disappeared two years
after William was born.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.216
I believe our son was
one of his test subjects.

32:53.855 --> 32:55.057
Let's go.

32:55.090 --> 32:58.226
Jackson knew
he was being hunted,

32:58.260 --> 33:00.328
so he hid the only way
he knew how.

33:00.362 --> 33:02.864
He created an alternate reality
playing dead.

33:03.931 --> 33:05.400
So he made us hear the shot...

33:08.436 --> 33:09.737
and see the hole in his head.

33:09.771 --> 33:11.206
Yes, and those two girls

33:11.239 --> 33:13.007
thought they saw a monster.

33:13.041 --> 33:15.410
And so, Mulder?

33:17.011 --> 33:18.713
Where is he now?

33:28.123 --> 33:30.925
Mmm.

33:30.958 --> 33:32.794
Jackson.

33:37.965 --> 33:40.402
My God, they told me
you were dead.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.837
Not yet.

33:42.870 --> 33:45.773
Oh, babe.

33:45.807 --> 33:47.675
These look sick.

33:47.709 --> 33:49.277
That's horrible.

33:49.311 --> 33:51.613
- I'm so sorry.
- Where have you been?

33:51.646 --> 33:53.115
I've been hiding.

33:53.148 --> 33:55.417
What? -There's these people,
they're after me. I...

33:55.450 --> 33:58.286
Look, I just...
I just came to apologize.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.255
What? -I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.723
I didn't think
that anyone would get hurt.

34:01.756 --> 34:03.391
I thought it'd be funny.
I thought it'd be, like,

34:03.425 --> 34:04.959
a prank, you know,
like, you'd see the Ghouli

34:04.992 --> 34:06.128
and you just run away. I...

34:06.161 --> 34:07.895
- Are you Ghouli?
- No.

34:07.929 --> 34:09.931
There's no such thing as Ghouli.

34:09.964 --> 34:11.733
I made up everything

34:11.766 --> 34:13.135
- on the Web site.
- No.

34:13.168 --> 34:14.636
Jackson, that...

34:14.668 --> 34:16.204
that thing attacked me.

34:16.237 --> 34:17.705
And the other girl.

34:17.739 --> 34:19.440
You attacked each other.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.909
You saw what I projected
into your head.

34:21.943 --> 34:24.812
All right, it's, like...

34:24.846 --> 34:27.215
this-this power.

34:27.248 --> 34:29.217
I was learning
to control it, okay?

34:29.251 --> 34:31.953
I... I just couldn't
stop it in time.

34:31.985 --> 34:33.588
I... There was so much blood.

34:33.621 --> 34:35.922
It was all just a blur.

34:35.956 --> 34:38.626
- That's really messed up.
- It is.

34:38.659 --> 34:42.597
All right? It-it started
when I would have my seizures.

34:42.630 --> 34:44.766
I'd...

34:44.799 --> 34:46.734
I'd see things.

34:46.768 --> 34:48.770
Terrifying things, like...

34:48.803 --> 34:50.172
like UFOs.

34:50.205 --> 34:53.908
And it would hurt
like hell, and...

34:53.940 --> 34:55.610
But when I was in pain,

34:55.643 --> 34:58.079
I could, I could, I could,
I could share it, kind of.

34:58.112 --> 34:59.414
Like, mentally.

34:59.447 --> 35:01.015
With who?

35:01.048 --> 35:03.951
This woman...
I-I don't know, she's...

35:03.985 --> 35:05.820
maybe my birth mother. I...

35:05.853 --> 35:09.191
Look, I came back because

35:09.224 --> 35:12.026
everyone around me is in danger.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.929
My parents are dead, Bri.

35:14.962 --> 35:17.432
But I wanted

35:17.465 --> 35:19.267
to say good-bye, okay?

35:19.301 --> 35:22.069
Okay.

35:29.411 --> 35:30.912
Oh, no.

35:33.748 --> 35:35.250
They found me.

35:44.859 --> 35:46.160
Take it easy, agents.

35:46.194 --> 35:47.562
You guys can relax.

35:47.595 --> 35:49.397
You can relax.
It's under control.

35:49.431 --> 35:51.833
You have Jackson Van de Kamp
in custody? -Well, not yet.

35:51.866 --> 35:53.034
And personally, I don't
understand how a dead guy

35:53.067 --> 35:54.302
can be up on his feet, but yeah.

35:54.336 --> 35:55.637
He's in there
and exits are covered.

35:55.670 --> 35:56.738
How do you know he's inside?

35:56.771 --> 36:00.308
I got a text from Sarah Turner.

36:00.342 --> 36:01.909
That's him.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.849
Detective, I'd like to ask you
to keep your officers outside

36:07.882 --> 36:09.584
so that we can be
the first to go in.

36:09.617 --> 36:11.486
Agents from the Department
of Defense are already inside.

36:11.519 --> 36:13.355
Excuse me.

36:17.725 --> 36:20.262
Geez, Sarah.

36:20.295 --> 36:22.997
You were kissing her.

36:23.030 --> 36:26.067
So I wanted to hurt you. I...

36:26.100 --> 36:27.702
So... And I texted them.

36:27.735 --> 36:29.337
I'm so sorry.

36:29.371 --> 36:32.874
I think that I should be the one
saying sorry. I...

36:32.907 --> 36:35.277
A-Are you gonna be in trouble?

36:35.310 --> 36:37.379
I think that they want
to kill me.

36:43.217 --> 36:45.219
It's my fault.

36:45.253 --> 36:47.589
This is...
this is all my fault.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.424
No, no, no, look.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.926
I'm gonna be all right, okay?

37:05.840 --> 37:07.575
He's coming your way.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.092
Evacuate the floor!

38:40.768 --> 38:42.570
Subject is headed your way.

38:45.507 --> 38:46.508
Hey! Don't move!

39:11.733 --> 39:14.402
Come on!

39:20.708 --> 39:21.876
FBI!

39:21.909 --> 39:23.110
Put your weapon down!

39:23.144 --> 39:24.311
Stay out of my way.

39:32.086 --> 39:34.088
I know you're here, boy.

39:45.733 --> 39:47.334
Stop!

40:03.350 --> 40:05.319
They shot each other.

40:05.352 --> 40:07.789
Well, who were they

40:07.822 --> 40:09.924
shooting at?

40:09.957 --> 40:11.559
He's here.

40:11.593 --> 40:12.894
Jackson!

40:12.927 --> 40:14.428
It's safe. It's over.

40:14.462 --> 40:17.765
Jackson, we just want
to talk to you.

40:17.799 --> 40:19.867
Make sure you're okay.

40:51.165 --> 40:53.501
Anything?

40:53.535 --> 40:56.203
No. He's disappeared.

41:20.528 --> 41:22.997
Do we need gas?

41:23.030 --> 41:25.332
I could use a bathroom.

41:36.410 --> 41:37.845
Mm.

41:37.879 --> 41:40.715
- Were you following me?
- Hey.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.049
Didn't I see you
at the hospital?

41:42.083 --> 41:44.051
It must be kismet.

41:44.085 --> 41:46.387
But I doubt we'll be seeing
each other again.

41:46.420 --> 41:48.155
I'm driving across country.

41:48.189 --> 41:50.157
Oh. A-Anywhere in particular?

41:50.191 --> 41:52.860
No, I just want
to see the world.

41:52.894 --> 41:55.529
Things are about to change.

41:57.364 --> 41:59.601
Hey.

41:59.634 --> 42:02.536
- Are you Dr. Masao Matsumoto?
- A doctor?

42:02.570 --> 42:05.740
No.
I never finished high school.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.743
You seem like a nice person.

42:08.776 --> 42:11.045
I wish I could know you better.

42:12.079 --> 42:14.616
Well, safe travels.

42:20.655 --> 42:22.389
If you don't stand
for something...

42:23.991 --> 42:25.960
you'll fall for anything.

42:32.767 --> 42:35.069
Who's that?

42:35.102 --> 42:37.805
Just a friendly old guy.

42:37.839 --> 42:39.841
But he seems so familiar.

42:41.609 --> 42:43.577
The Pick Up Artist.

42:43.611 --> 42:44.578
What are you talking about?

42:44.612 --> 42:46.413
That book in Jackson's room.

42:46.447 --> 42:48.382
I think he's the author.

42:48.415 --> 42:50.317
What'd he say?

42:50.351 --> 42:53.154
He gave me a piece of advice.
He said...

42:53.187 --> 42:55.156
he said, "If you don't
stand for something,

42:55.189 --> 42:56.758
you'll fall for anything."

42:56.791 --> 42:59.961
That's a Malcolm X quote,
Scully.

43:11.172 --> 43:13.174
Scully.

43:18.713 --> 43:20.782
We need to see
your surveillance video.

43:20.815 --> 43:22.950
Now.

43:25.987 --> 43:28.189
Right there.

43:28.222 --> 43:30.124
Are you
Dr. Masao Matsumoto?

43:30.157 --> 43:31.358
A doctor?
No, I...

43:31.392 --> 43:33.160
I never finished high school.

43:33.194 --> 43:36.163
You seem like a nice person.

43:36.197 --> 43:39.466
I wish I could know you better.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.836
Safe travels.
