00:04.210 --> 00:05.210
Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.210 --> 00:06.790
Did you tell Buffy and Cyrus?

00:06.790 --> 00:09.460
It's not like you can start a
conversation with, "Oh, hey, guys,

00:09.460 --> 00:11.960
guess what? My sister's my mother
and my mother's my grandmother."

00:11.960 --> 00:13.540
Celia:
 I'm not your grandmother.

00:13.540 --> 00:15.420
What word
should I use, then? Nana?

00:15.420 --> 00:16.710
Celia:
 No!

00:16.710 --> 00:20.670
Your sister has a secret baby?

00:20.670 --> 00:22.040
Yes.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.290
We are supporting you
in your thrilling new endeavor.

00:24.290 --> 00:25.500
Talking to Jonah Beck.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.330
Hey, friends of Andi!

00:26.330 --> 00:27.790
Hey, Jonah Beck!

00:27.790 --> 00:29.080
You made this?

00:29.080 --> 00:31.500
It's not that hard.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.830
Why can't we talk
about the secret baby?

00:32.830 --> 00:34.250
I'm the secret baby!

00:34.250 --> 00:37.000
Bex is my mother, and my
mother is my grandmother,

00:37.000 --> 00:40.880
and Amber is wearing
my bracelet!

00:40.880 --> 00:42.790
I have some questions.
Do you?

00:42.790 --> 00:43.790
One or two.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.420
How about "Meemaw"?

00:50.420 --> 00:52.540
What am I, 100?

00:52.540 --> 00:54.540
Well, what should
I call you, then?

00:54.540 --> 00:56.500
Because you don't wanna
be called "Grandma,"

00:56.500 --> 00:58.000
but you're not
my mom anymore.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.500
For now, why don't
you just call me Celia?

01:00.500 --> 01:04.540
I can't call you Celia. That sounds
like we just met at a luncheon.

01:04.540 --> 01:07.330
Eat your muesli
before it gets soggy.

01:07.330 --> 01:08.830
Too... late.

01:08.830 --> 01:11.290
Maybe we can just grab a donut
on the way to school?

01:16.540 --> 01:18.120
Thank you, Celia.

Those look good, can I have one?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.420
-Yeah.
-No.

02:15.420 --> 02:18.500
Oh, right. 'Cause sugar
doesn't set you up

02:18.500 --> 02:19.880
for a successful day.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.420
Come on, Mom, you gotta
have a little fun.

02:26.330 --> 02:29.500
What are you even doing up
in time for breakfast, anyway?

02:29.500 --> 02:30.540
For your information,

02:30.540 --> 02:31.920
today is my first day

02:31.920 --> 02:33.750
at my new... job.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.120
You got a job? Cool.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.710
How?

02:37.710 --> 02:40.000
I grew up in this town.
I know people.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.120
I've got connections.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.460
Isn't this, like, so crazy?

02:47.460 --> 02:48.580
I mean, did you ever think

02:48.580 --> 02:49.880
that one day the kid

02:49.880 --> 02:50.920
you used to babysit

02:50.920 --> 02:52.040
would be your boss?

02:52.040 --> 02:53.750
I honestly never did.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.670
So, you said I'm going
to be giving makeovers

02:55.670 --> 02:56.830
and stuff like that?

02:56.830 --> 02:59.420
Totally. I used to be the one
giving makeovers,

02:59.420 --> 03:03.170
but the guy that owns this place
said that I look "too scary"

03:03.170 --> 03:04.620
and "like a vampire."

03:04.620 --> 03:05.790
No, really?

03:05.790 --> 03:07.290
I know, right?

03:07.290 --> 03:09.960
Real talk? I think
he just likes to start drama,

03:09.960 --> 03:13.000
which I hate.
That's why I got this.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.460
Oh, uh-huh.
"Down 2 Earth."

03:16.460 --> 03:18.290
Please tell me that's fake.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.080
It is.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.420
So I can show the tattoo artist where
I want the real one to go. Obvi.

03:23.420 --> 03:26.330
Brittany... wow. You know,
when I used to babysit you,

03:26.330 --> 03:30.250
I had no idea that you were
gonna turn out so, um...

03:30.250 --> 03:31.670
interesting.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.170
Okay, I get called that
all the time.

03:34.170 --> 03:37.880
But it's just because people can't
put me in some convenient tub.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.290
Don't you mean box?

03:39.290 --> 03:41.790
No, Bex... tub.

03:41.790 --> 03:44.290
Because I'm
a very multi-fauceted person.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.460
I think that's multi-faceted.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.580
Ohh...

03:49.580 --> 03:52.960
Oh. So, where do you want me
to start?

03:52.960 --> 03:54.460
Start anywhere you want.

03:54.460 --> 03:58.830
Only, can you want to start by cleaning
out the masks in the costume department?

03:58.830 --> 04:01.750
Someone tried them on and got
concealer in all the noses.

04:01.750 --> 04:04.290
Thank you, love you,
heart you, xoxo!

I was never frozen.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.960
I was only pretending
because I hate PE.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.580
Can I pretend with you? I'm not really
in the mood to capture anything today.

04:27.580 --> 04:29.170
Things still weird at home?

04:29.170 --> 04:32.580
Two moms, one house, and they
agree zero percent of the time.

04:32.580 --> 04:33.920
-Yikes.
-On the bright side,

04:33.920 --> 04:36.290
I did have my first Toaster Tart
today, so I guess--

05:07.380 --> 05:11.290
Thanks, Mr. Reznikoff. I'm not
gonna lie, that felt really good.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.620
Oh, suck it up, Ian. Next time,
get outta the way faster.

05:23.210 --> 05:25.620
Come on, guys,
be happy for me.

05:25.620 --> 05:30.670
Mr. Rez thinks I'm so fast, he asked me
to join the track and field relay team.

05:30.670 --> 05:33.750
I'd be happier for you
if I could turn my neck.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.750
You do recognize us out there, right?
Andi and your old friend Cyrus?

05:37.750 --> 05:40.880
Eighty-eight pounds of quivering
jelly, no core strength?

05:40.880 --> 05:42.580
So, I like winning!

05:42.580 --> 05:44.500
When did that become
a bad thing?

05:44.500 --> 05:46.880
Yo, Andi!

05:46.880 --> 05:51.420
Oh, I gotta go.
My, uh... Bex is here.

05:51.420 --> 05:52.790
Bye, guys.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.330
What are you doing?

05:57.330 --> 05:59.580
I thought I'd surprise you
and come pick you up.

05:59.580 --> 06:01.620
On your motorcycle?

06:01.620 --> 06:05.500
Did Mom-- I mean,
did Celia say it was okay?

06:05.500 --> 06:07.380
It's okay to have a little fun.

06:07.380 --> 06:10.420
And let me worry
about Celia.

06:12.210 --> 06:13.710
Plus we don't have to tell her.

06:15.290 --> 06:17.330
Atta girl.

06:17.330 --> 06:18.540
Whoa.

06:18.540 --> 06:21.290
Is Mrs. Devlin
still around?

06:21.290 --> 06:23.420
She was the librarian
when I went here.

06:23.420 --> 06:26.500
Have you seen that old horror
movie that has a librarian

06:26.500 --> 06:29.380
that looks just like her?
It's called "Shhh!".

06:29.380 --> 06:31.750
No. I'm not allowed
to see scary movies.

06:31.750 --> 06:37.080
I wasn't even allowed to see ET because
the kids ride bikes without helmets.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.500
Well, guess what?
You're watchin' one... tonight.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.000
No way.
This is not happening.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.460
I'm not asking
your permission.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.500
Besides, it's more funny
than scary.

06:47.500 --> 06:51.210
The tagline is, "Revenge
is overdue." Get it?

06:51.210 --> 06:54.460
I will not have horror movies
in this house. Or puns.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.330
Mom, you've never
let loose. The wildest thing

06:56.330 --> 06:59.250
that you've ever done
is your own taxes.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.830
I understand
more than you think.

07:00.830 --> 07:03.710
For instance, I raised you.
And we both know

07:03.710 --> 07:05.080
that there are some things

07:05.080 --> 07:08.000
that Andi is not ready
to experience.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.790
(crickets chirping)

07:16.080 --> 07:18.920
Okay, Andi...

07:18.920 --> 07:20.540
Mm-wah-ha-ha-ha...

07:20.540 --> 07:23.420
move over, it's time
for "Shhh!"

07:23.420 --> 07:25.040
What did Celia say?

07:25.040 --> 07:26.540
There's not much she can say.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.620
Wow, I actually
have butterflies.

07:28.620 --> 07:30.790
You said it's more funny
than scary, right?

07:30.790 --> 07:34.790
Yes, exactly! Like an angry
squirrel, or a golf cart accident.

07:34.790 --> 07:35.880
Heh...

07:35.880 --> 07:37.380
Hey, look,
if you get really scared,

07:37.380 --> 07:39.540
I'm gonna be right here
with you the whole time.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.460
-Okay?
-Okay.

07:47.670 --> 07:51.380
(horror movie music playing)

07:51.380 --> 07:53.960
(screaming)

07:58.420 --> 08:01.290
(screaming)

08:04.580 --> 08:06.000
(screaming)

08:17.500 --> 08:19.250
Andi?

08:19.250 --> 08:21.540
Jeez, Cyrus, can you warn me
the next time

08:21.540 --> 08:24.290
you wanna just talk
outta the blue like that?

08:24.290 --> 08:28.380
Okay, what's your deal? I don't know
whether to tell you to perk up,

08:28.380 --> 08:29.420
or calm down?

08:29.420 --> 08:32.789
Bex had me watch this super
scary movie last night.

08:32.789 --> 08:33.880
It's about this librarian

08:33.880 --> 08:36.500
that looks
just like Mrs. Devlin.

08:36.500 --> 08:40.580
Except when she tells you to "Shhh"...
then, you start to gag,

08:40.580 --> 08:43.880
and then you can't breathe,
and then you die!

08:43.880 --> 08:47.000
But the worst part is,
when they look at you later,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.290
there's nothing in your mouth,
not your teeth, or your tongue,

08:50.290 --> 08:53.120
it's just a big, black,
stinking hole!

08:53.120 --> 08:56.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you going to be okay?

08:56.750 --> 08:59.330
Yeah, I just have to make it
through this class.

09:02.380 --> 09:04.380
Andi! Andi!

09:04.380 --> 09:05.960
Andi!

09:05.960 --> 09:08.540
Andi Mack,
do you want detention?

09:08.540 --> 09:10.000
You got it.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.880
I can't believe I got detention
for sleeping in class.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.330
And now I'm gonna miss
my first Jonah.

09:15.330 --> 09:16.670
Game.

09:16.670 --> 09:17.920
Right.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.330
Isn't that what I said?

09:20.380 --> 09:22.670
Cyrus, whatcha doin'?

09:22.670 --> 09:24.380
I'm being a fan.

09:24.380 --> 09:27.710
You know, most people
just say, "Go team."

09:27.710 --> 09:31.330
What about me makes you think
that I'm "most people"?

09:31.330 --> 09:33.330
Good point.
See you guys.

09:34.290 --> 09:37.380
Dude, Cyrus, this spread
is wicked sick.

09:37.380 --> 09:40.000
I was going for "classy casual,"
but I'll take it.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.540
I think you might be
our secret weapon.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.330
After, Andiman here, right?

09:44.330 --> 09:47.330
Uh, Andi? Isn't there something
you need to tell Jonah?

09:47.330 --> 09:49.620
You have a nice smile.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.710
Detention?

09:51.710 --> 09:55.710
Right! Right.
And, I got detention.

09:55.710 --> 09:57.290
You got detention?

09:57.290 --> 10:00.330
Whoa! Andiman's got layers.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.000
Sorry I can't play today.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.830
Yeah. We'll miss you.

10:03.830 --> 10:05.960
Tell old Mrs. Devlin
hi for me.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.750
Mrs. Devlin?
As in the librarian?

10:08.750 --> 10:11.380
Wh-- Wh-- Why would I
be seeing her?

10:11.380 --> 10:14.880
(laughs) Because... detention's
always in the library, right?

10:14.880 --> 10:18.170
Just between us...
she kinda creeps me out.

10:18.170 --> 10:20.830
Well, i-- isn't there
maybe another option,

10:20.830 --> 10:22.830
possibly an abandoned
caretaker's shed,

10:22.830 --> 10:25.330
or a windowless room
in a basement?

10:28.290 --> 10:30.500
(eerie music playing)

10:30.500 --> 10:32.420
(lights buzzing)

10:35.000 --> 10:39.540
(three loud booms)

11:01.330 --> 11:04.120
Welcome to detention.

11:04.120 --> 11:08.380
Looks like it's just
you and me.

11:08.380 --> 11:09.790

leg by over five seconds!

11:51.330 --> 11:52.380
Is that good?

11:52.380 --> 11:53.580
That's a new school record!

11:53.580 --> 11:56.460
You do that well in the meet
later, we're gonna win for sure!

11:56.460 --> 11:58.040
(cheering and clapping)

11:58.040 --> 11:59.880
This calls for a selfie.

12:02.540 --> 12:05.620
Oh... right.
And now a group one.

12:07.120 --> 12:11.580
♪ Woooo, woooo ♪

12:11.580 --> 12:13.420
Put it all over your face, okay?

12:13.420 --> 12:16.830
-♪ Night and day ♪
 -♪ Night and day ♪

12:16.830 --> 12:19.250

12:23.580 --> 12:25.710

12:25.710 --> 12:30.290
♪ Night and day

12:31.830 --> 12:33.210
Hey, what's all this?

12:33.210 --> 12:35.290
Oh, it's apple cider.
We won!

12:35.290 --> 12:36.460
Nice, me, too.

12:36.460 --> 12:39.580
I got a faster time
than any of those slowpokes.

12:39.580 --> 12:41.540
Don't you mean
your teammates?

12:41.540 --> 12:43.580
Right... I keep forgetting.

12:43.580 --> 12:45.380
Cyrus, you're awesome!

12:45.380 --> 12:47.380
This is the first game we've had
where no one got heat stroke

12:47.380 --> 12:49.330
or second degree sunburn.

12:49.330 --> 12:53.380
Aw... don't thank me. Thank my grandma for
teaching me the importance of sunscreen.

12:53.380 --> 12:57.330
It was my job to keep an eye on all of
her, you know... questionable moles.

12:57.330 --> 12:58.750
-Cool.
-Ew.

12:58.750 --> 13:00.790
Well, we seriously couldn't
have won without you.

13:00.790 --> 13:03.330
You killed it.

13:03.330 --> 13:07.380
Cy-rus! Cy-rus! Cy-rus! Cy-rus!

13:07.380 --> 13:11.540
Cy-rus! Cy-rus! Cy-rus! Cy-rus!

13:20.330 --> 13:24.880
(clock ticking)

13:33.040 --> 13:38.210
(tension-building music)

13:41.500 --> 13:42.540
Ah-choo!

13:46.920 --> 13:49.290
Shhhhhhhh!

13:50.790 --> 13:52.420
(screaming)

13:55.500 --> 13:58.830
If you're going to terrify Andi, you
could've at least stayed awake for it!

13:58.830 --> 14:01.250
But now, your mistakes
are hurting her.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.540
I'm not sure
she's safe with you.

14:02.540 --> 14:05.500
She needs a mother that's gonna
teach her how to be brave.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.500
No, she needs a mother
who knows what she's doing.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.170
For the last time, that is
not your decision to make.

14:11.170 --> 14:12.920
I'm her mother!

14:12.920 --> 14:15.380
I was her mother,
and she was happy!

14:15.380 --> 14:18.000
No, she wasn't.
Were you?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.750
Yes, she was!
Andi, tell her.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.710
Wh-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:24.710 --> 14:27.580
Am I crazy? Because it
sounds like you two

14:27.580 --> 14:30.000
are trying to get me
to pick a mother!

14:33.920 --> 14:35.170
Are you kidding me?

14:35.170 --> 14:36.620
I am not going to pick!

14:36.620 --> 14:38.580
No, of course not.
We wouldn't do that.

14:38.580 --> 14:39.880
But if we did--

14:39.880 --> 14:43.080
No way! I'm not the one
who created this mess.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.500
You two are the brain trust
that decided

14:45.500 --> 14:48.210
that you should pretend
to by my sister,

14:48.210 --> 14:51.420
because you don't want people to
know you're really my grandmother!

14:51.420 --> 14:55.460
-Andi-- -No! I'm the kid
here, you're the adults.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.330
It's your job
to figure this out.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.210
Let me know when you do.

14:59.210 --> 15:00.750
I will be in my room.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.420
She so much smarter
than we are.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.420
You can see why
I don't wanna let her go.

15:08.290 --> 15:10.920
You don't have
to let her go.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.750
You just
have to let me in.

15:30.290 --> 15:32.790
Go, Buffy!
Knock 'em dead!

15:32.790 --> 15:35.210
I meant that metaphorically,
don't actually hurt anyone.

15:41.460 --> 15:42.620
Go!

15:48.380 --> 15:51.670
♪ See me comin'

16:37.380 --> 16:38.790

16:39.790 --> 16:41.670
Buffy! I can't believe you!

16:41.670 --> 16:46.500
I know, I didn't pass the baton, because
I remembered what you said, Mr. Rez.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.040
With me on the team,
we would win.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.170
And we did!

16:50.170 --> 16:53.580
We didn't win! We were
disqualified, it's a relay.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.000
All of the runners
need to participate.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.290
Mr. Rez, I just really
wanted to win.

16:59.290 --> 17:03.420
And... I guess I just thought
everyone else would get in my way.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.579
You're talented, Buffy.

17:05.579 --> 17:07.210
But you get
in your own way.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.380
Look, you can't win 'em all.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.960
Yes... you can.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.960
It's called a sweep...
a no-hitter.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.710
An undefeated season.

17:19.710 --> 17:21.710
There are actual terms
for winning them all.

17:21.710 --> 17:23.329
But winning isn't everything.

17:23.329 --> 17:25.040
Of course it is!

17:25.040 --> 17:26.829
That's why I like sports.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.830
You always know
where you stand.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.500
You're the best
or you're not.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.170
It's uncomplicated.

17:32.170 --> 17:35.250
Let me just tell you something that
I've learned from my own sport.

17:35.250 --> 17:38.710
Without our teammates,
all we are is discs in the wind.

17:38.710 --> 17:42.380
Cyrus, I know you brought a cooler
to a game of catch and all,

17:42.380 --> 17:44.540
but that does not
make you an athlete.

17:44.540 --> 17:47.500
I didn't just bring a cooler.
I brought all kinds of snacks.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.790
Now everyone's callin' me
the protein pre-teen.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.330
No... they're not.

17:52.330 --> 17:55.000
You're right.
I just made that up.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.250
Oh, my gosh.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.460
I can't believe
you didn't pass the baton.

17:59.460 --> 18:01.080
Give it up.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.500
Hey.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.170
Hey, you.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.670
What's goin' on?

18:08.670 --> 18:10.540
Andi, look...

18:12.500 --> 18:14.080
Mom saved this.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.710
She saved all of this
stuff of mine.

18:16.710 --> 18:19.040
My third grade spelling tests.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.750
Wow... you got all A's.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.460
I wasn't always a bad seed.

18:23.460 --> 18:26.920
Oh, "The Bad Seed,"
now that's a good scary movie,

18:26.920 --> 18:28.460
it's a classic.
What am I doing?

18:28.460 --> 18:31.670
This is how I got in trouble
in the first place...

18:31.670 --> 18:33.580
for showing you
a scary movie.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.790
She was right.
I shouldn't have done that.

18:35.790 --> 18:38.120
Yes, you should have!

18:38.120 --> 18:40.710
I need to branch out...
toughen up!

18:40.710 --> 18:42.670
I should at least be brave
enough to watch a movie

18:42.670 --> 18:44.880
about a psychotic librarian.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.880
Yeah, at least
I can help with that.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.880
Holy molar!

18:50.880 --> 18:54.330
Why... did she save this?

18:55.380 --> 18:59.210
Was this... a bathing suit?

18:59.210 --> 19:02.330
Just so you know... I will never
be brave enough to wear this.

19:02.330 --> 19:04.040
Me, neither.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.330
This isn't yours?

19:06.330 --> 19:08.040
It's mine.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.830
Whoa--

19:09.830 --> 19:11.380
Mom!

19:12.710 --> 19:14.750
I wasn't always
serving muesli.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.460
(laughs)

19:16.460 --> 19:17.830
I'll take that, thank you.

19:17.830 --> 19:21.250
-You actually wore this.
-Yes, I did.

19:21.250 --> 19:24.290
Once upon a time,
I was known as... "Cece."

19:24.290 --> 19:26.420
Cece?

19:26.420 --> 19:29.920
In fact... that's what you
can call me from now on.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.460
Cece is your grandma name?

19:32.460 --> 19:36.500
Really? You think you can call me
"Grandma" knowing I wore this?

19:39.330 --> 19:44.040
-(both laugh) -I can't
believe that just happened!

19:44.040 --> 19:46.080
You know what
I can't believe?

19:46.080 --> 19:50.290
This woman wouldn't let me
go to a party or wear lip gloss.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.710
She won't even let me
eat a Toaster Tart.

19:52.710 --> 19:53.790
I'm gonna have one
right now.

19:53.790 --> 19:56.420
Oh, no-- Don't!
I ran... out.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.290
This picture...
why are you hiding it?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.420
Who is this?

20:07.120 --> 20:09.420
Andi...

20:09.420 --> 20:12.120
This is my dad...
isn't it?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.330
Bex: Next, on Andi Mack...
(theme music playing)

20:21.330 --> 20:22.420
Your mom thing.

20:22.420 --> 20:23.540
You heard.

20:23.540 --> 20:24.580
Can I take a selfie with you?

20:24.580 --> 20:25.750
Yeah... sure.

20:25.750 --> 20:29.620
I guess congratulations
are in order.... Grandma.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.290
(screaming)

20:31.290 --> 20:33.380
Uh, we're gettin' away.
We should get goin'.

20:33.380 --> 20:35.000
I'm trusting you.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.830
Andi, we could have a party!

20:36.830 --> 20:40.170
(dance music playing)

20:42.380 --> 20:43.620
Your parents are here!

20:43.620 --> 20:46.040
Celia:
Everybody out!
