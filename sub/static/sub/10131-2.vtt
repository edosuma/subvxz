17:00.812 --> 17:04.148
that milk scam didn't work.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.442
Alright, we'll

17:04.190 --> 17:06.442
go to my specialty

17:06.484 --> 17:08.569
personal charm, now,

17:06.484 --> 17:08.569
you wait right here

17:08.611 --> 17:10.363
I'll be back with

17:08.611 --> 17:10.363
your new best friend, okay?

17:10.404 --> 17:12.114
Sit down, now.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.375
Little girl, how'd you

17:19.455 --> 17:22.375
like to make a new friend?

17:22.416 --> 17:24.836
Stranger, stranger, stranger!

17:28.006 --> 17:31.425
Whoa, whoa. What, what

17:28.006 --> 17:31.425
is going on here?

17:31.467 --> 17:35.596
Uh, nothin', I'm just trying

17:31.467 --> 17:35.596
to help the kids become friends.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.139
Who are you?

17:37.181 --> 17:39.767
I'm, uh, I'm this pretty

17:37.181 --> 17:39.767
little girl's father.

17:39.809 --> 17:43.563
- Right, Steph?

17:39.809 --> 17:43.563
- Uh, okay.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.105
Well, look,

17:43.604 --> 17:45.105
as long as you're here

17:45.147 --> 17:46.733
would you come with me

17:45.147 --> 17:46.733
to the supply room

17:46.774 --> 17:48.526
and kill something

17:46.774 --> 17:48.526
with eight legs?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.446
I'll be right back, Steph.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.446
This happens to me all the time.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.615
Everybody loves

17:52.488 --> 17:54.615
the exterminator.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.625
- Hi, Stephanie.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.625
- Hi.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.171
Wow. This place is great.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.131
You got toys and blocks

18:11.173 --> 18:13.676
and pin the tail on the donkey.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.636
Sure wish I lived here.

18:15.678 --> 18:16.930
Here, take my place.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.057
Whoa.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.309
Okay, there's only one

18:19.098 --> 18:22.309
sure-fire way to make friends.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.937
It's Duck-Duck-Goose time.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.355
Alright, everybody,

18:23.978 --> 18:26.355
Stephanie has a great idea.

18:26.397 --> 18:29.483
It's Duck-Duck-Goose time.

18:26.397 --> 18:29.483
In a circle. That's right.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.944
We're ducking, we're goosing

18:30.985 --> 18:32.653
we're having a great time!

18:32.695 --> 18:36.323
Alright! Okay!

18:32.695 --> 18:36.323
Sitting down! Okay!

18:36.365 --> 18:39.118
Yeah, Duck-Duck-Goose.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.118
My favorite.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.621
Duck, duck, duck, duck

18:41.662 --> 18:43.664
duck, duck, duck, duck

18:43.706 --> 18:44.832
duck, goose!

18:44.874 --> 18:47.376
You gotta catch me.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.211
We're having a great time.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.676
Hello.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.637
Uh, go to your chair.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.973
Find your chairs.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.432
Who are you?

19:01.474 --> 19:04.393
Uh, I'm this

19:01.474 --> 19:04.393
pretty little girl's father.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.939
Uh, okay.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.151
What are you guys doing here?

19:12.192 --> 19:14.445
- Who are you?

19:12.192 --> 19:14.445
- Who me?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.990
I'm this adorable

19:14.487 --> 19:16.990
little girl's father.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.784
Uh-huh.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.536
What? Elizabeth Taylor's

19:19.826 --> 19:22.536
daughter had seven fathers.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.208
Whoa, Danny,

19:26.499 --> 19:28.208
more good news

19:28.250 --> 19:30.670
'D.J.'s goin' over the wall.'

19:30.711 --> 19:33.089
Oh, yeah, this dad

19:30.711 --> 19:33.089
stuff's a piece of cake.

19:33.131 --> 19:36.050
Here. Take the little poopster.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.343
Well, stay right here.

19:37.384 --> 19:40.513
Okay, daddy...

19:37.384 --> 19:40.513
and daddy and daddy.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.183
Freeze. What is this?

19:44.224 --> 19:46.769
I don't wanna

19:44.224 --> 19:46.769
jump to conclusions

19:46.811 --> 19:47.979
but it appears what we have here

19:48.021 --> 19:50.314
is my daughter

19:48.021 --> 19:50.314
is ditching school

19:50.356 --> 19:51.649
throwing away her future

19:51.691 --> 19:54.193
and basically becoming

19:51.691 --> 19:54.193
a juvenile delinquent.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.155
In a nutshell, yes.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.865
Would you mind

19:57.196 --> 19:58.865
if I ask you a question

19:58.906 --> 20:01.034
before you go

19:58.906 --> 20:01.034
knock off a 7-eleven?

20:02.242 --> 20:04.370
Why are you dropping

20:02.242 --> 20:04.370
out of school?

20:07.289 --> 20:10.459
Because they put me

20:07.289 --> 20:10.459
in the smart class.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.837
The advanced class?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.630
D.J., that's wonderful.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.133
Dad, it's Geek-ville, USA.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.511
These kids,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.511
the first day of school

20:20.553 --> 20:22.680
they brought homework.

20:23.806 --> 20:27.185
And get this,

20:23.806 --> 20:27.185
I'm the only blonde.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.897
And worst of all,

20:27.226 --> 20:30.897
they split me and Kimmy up.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.065
Oh.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.401
I know you're disappointed

20:35.442 --> 20:38.029
but it's not like

20:35.442 --> 20:38.029
you'll never see Kimmy again.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.780
She lives next door.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.325
Dad, you don't understand.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.537
Kimmy and I have

20:43.367 --> 20:46.537
always been in the same class.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.915
And now I'm in

20:46.579 --> 20:48.915
a room full of eggheads.

20:50.374 --> 20:53.252
They're worse than eggheads.

20:50.374 --> 20:53.252
They're omelet-heads.

20:55.046 --> 20:58.799
D.J., it's the omelet-heads

20:55.046 --> 20:58.799
who rule the world.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.929
You really should

21:00.968 --> 21:02.929
give this a chance.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.097
Do you know why?

21:04.138 --> 21:05.305
Why?

21:05.347 --> 21:07.058
Because if you don't

21:05.347 --> 21:07.058
try new things

21:07.100 --> 21:09.351
you're never gonna know

21:07.100 --> 21:09.351
what you're missing out on.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.396
(Stephanie)

21:11.062 --> 21:12.396
'Bye.'

21:14.440 --> 21:16.650
- Bye, dad.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.650
- 'Hold it.'

21:16.692 --> 21:18.444
Where do you

21:16.692 --> 21:18.444
think you're going?

21:18.485 --> 21:19.904
Home.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.948
You're not going anywhere.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.199
Nobody's going anyplace

21:23.241 --> 21:25.367
unless it's back

21:23.241 --> 21:25.367
into those two rooms.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.496
- There she is.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.496
- I got this.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.083
What you need to understand--

21:32.125 --> 21:34.043
- Dad?

21:32.125 --> 21:34.043
- Yes?

21:35.544 --> 21:36.670
Stay.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.675
Let me just talk

21:39.132 --> 21:41.675
to my sister alone, okay?

21:41.717 --> 21:45.179
Woman to woman.

21:41.717 --> 21:45.179
I think I can help.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.807
Alright.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.807
You can talk to her.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.600
But remember..

21:49.642 --> 21:51.310
...I'm trusting you.

21:51.351 --> 21:54.230
I promise we won't

21:51.351 --> 21:54.230
try to make a break for it.

21:54.272 --> 21:55.397
Okay.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.029
Steph..

22:03.864 --> 22:05.866
What's wrong?

22:05.908 --> 22:08.494
No friends.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.330
You can't expect to make

22:08.535 --> 22:11.330
friends the first day.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.124
You know when

22:11.371 --> 22:13.124
I started kindergarten

22:13.166 --> 22:15.084
I didn't know

22:13.166 --> 22:15.084
anybody, either.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.003
What about Kimmy?

22:17.044 --> 22:18.504
We were just in the same class

22:18.545 --> 22:21.132
but I didn't talk

22:18.545 --> 22:21.132
to Kimmy for six months.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.383
Because she's an airhead?

22:24.718 --> 22:27.638
She's not an airhead.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.638
She just hates thinking.

22:29.265 --> 22:33.269
That's probably why we're

22:29.265 --> 22:33.269
not in the same class anymore.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.688
I just got stuck in

22:33.311 --> 22:35.688
a room full of omelet-heads

22:35.729 --> 22:39.317
where I don't know

22:35.729 --> 22:39.317
one person. It's pretty scary.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.319
Real scary.

22:41.359 --> 22:44.238
But, Steph, you can't run away

22:41.359 --> 22:44.238
every time you're scared.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.531
If you don't try new things

22:45.572 --> 22:49.451
you'll never know what

22:45.572 --> 22:49.451
you're missing out on.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.620
Where did I hear that?

22:53.622 --> 22:55.833
Oh, no.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.833
He was right.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.627
Who was right?

22:58.669 --> 23:01.547
Uh, you don't know him.

23:01.588 --> 23:04.175
Anyways, making

23:01.588 --> 23:04.175
new friends takes time

23:05.843 --> 23:08.595
but you got one really

23:05.843 --> 23:08.595
good friend at school already.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.056
Who?

23:11.389 --> 23:13.351
Me.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.811
And I'm right

23:13.391 --> 23:15.811
down the hall. Room seven.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.856
You can't miss me. I'm the only

23:15.853 --> 23:18.856
omelet-head with blonde hair.

23:21.525 --> 23:22.609
Thanks.

23:23.194 --> 23:26.030
[bell rings]

23:28.282 --> 23:29.783
Steph, I'll

23:28.282 --> 23:29.783
go back to my class

23:29.825 --> 23:31.202
if you go back to yours, okay?

23:31.244 --> 23:32.370
