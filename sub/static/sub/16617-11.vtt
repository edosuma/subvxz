But, Todd, what if
she wanders off again?

00:21.655 --> 00:23.455
LEWIS:<i> She's a danger to herself</i>
<i>and maybe to us.</i>

00:23.457 --> 00:25.157
We can't just let her
roam around here.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.492
We could lock her
in that focus group room

00:26.494 --> 00:27.559

00:27.561 --> 00:29.328

00:29.330 --> 00:30.396

LEWIS:
<i>Figure if I get good enough,</i>

00:31.966 --> 00:34.967

00:36.336 --> 00:38.404
♪ ♪

00:47.680 --> 00:50.849
It's creepy. It's like she can
see us through the mirror.

00:50.851 --> 00:51.917
LEWIS:
You think she's still mad?

00:51.919 --> 00:53.218
TODD:
It's hard to tell.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.721
She's just been sitting
like that for the past hour.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.322
It's very unnerving.

00:57.324 --> 00:59.358
Bud, you're doing
the right thing.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.160
This is for
her own safety.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.095
Yeah, but it still
doesn't feel right.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.897
Well, why don't
I go check on her?

01:04.899 --> 01:07.699
I used to shadow the HR lady
at the hot sauce company,

01:07.701 --> 01:10.736
so I know my way around
a psychotic episode.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.839
Hi, Melissa.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.140
(no audio)

01:18.912 --> 01:21.713
Well, that was not fun.
What happened?

01:21.715 --> 01:23.916
Well, she just said
that Gail didn't go to Napa,

01:23.918 --> 01:25.717
but she threw herself
over a cliff

01:25.719 --> 01:27.719
'cause I bugged her too much.
(chuckles)

01:27.721 --> 01:29.288
Hey, don't listen
to Melissa, okay?

01:29.290 --> 01:31.056
She's just trying
to get under your skin.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.758
It's a classic lash out.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.760
Here, let me give it a try.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.829
(no audio)

01:41.534 --> 01:44.136
She said the last thing
that Mike said before he died

01:44.138 --> 01:47.139
was, uh, "Where's my brother?"

01:47.141 --> 01:48.207
Here, let me try.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.575
She hasn't known
me for as long,

01:49.577 --> 01:51.410
so she doesn't have
any emotional ammo.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.479
(no audio)

01:58.218 --> 01:59.952
She said Mark is still alive.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.086
Oh, that's positive.
Oh.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.088
And living with his new lover
in Tokyo.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.491
Oh, she got you on the flippety
with that one.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.160
(muted):
Hi, Melissa.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.662
(no audio)

02:10.664 --> 02:12.965
Australia sank.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.033
(no audio)

02:16.636 --> 02:18.904
I'm getting fat.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.839
No one likes a short man.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.742
I'm pregnant with Mike's baby.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.511
Racial slur.

02:26.679 --> 02:29.581
I mean, she actually just said
the words "racial slur."

02:30.917 --> 02:32.451
Well, now I'm definitely
not going in there.

02:32.453 --> 02:35.354
I mean, she's already the most
pissed at me for locking her up.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.289
Oh, Todd, she'll come around.
Don't beat yourself up.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.258
MELISSA (singsongy):
Judas.

02:41.594 --> 02:44.630
Oh, Judas.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.599
Two-way mirror--
how can she tell where you are?

02:47.601 --> 02:49.668
I'll never forgive you, Todd.

02:49.670 --> 02:53.005
Wow, she's really nailing the
worst-thing-you-can-hear thing.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.773
Yeah.

02:58.611 --> 03:01.880
TANDY:
<i>Nice takeoff, very smooth.</i>

03:01.882 --> 03:03.782
You're a regular
Sully Sullenberger.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.717
Sully Sullenberger?
I hardly "knewenberger."

03:05.719 --> 03:07.052
(laughs)

03:07.054 --> 03:09.021
You want a drink?
Yeah. I could use one.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.623
All right.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.158
Where did you get all these?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.193
Oh, come on.

03:14.195 --> 03:15.827
We got an airplane.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.197
If we didn't have tiny bottles,
we'd be gigantic "bott-holes."

03:18.199 --> 03:20.032
(laughs)
Well, that one worked well.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.600
Down the hatch.

03:24.237 --> 03:25.837
Mm.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.073
So, uh, when do you think
that you'll be ready

03:28.075 --> 03:31.310
to take, like, a real flight,
get out there and go see Mark?

03:31.312 --> 03:33.745
Technically, I've logged
enough hours in here

03:33.747 --> 03:35.747
to try a test run,
but I don't know.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.749
I just don't feel
quite ready yet.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.218
Well, take your time.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.752
You'll know when you're ready.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.354
You don't want to rush
something like flying.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.589
That's pure suicide.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.057
Round two?

03:45.059 --> 03:46.191
Ah, I probably shouldn't.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.726
I want to get
some more flights in here.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.094
Hey, don't worry.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.762
I got you a little Breathalyzer.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.665
Breathalyzer?
I hardly "knewalyzer."

03:53.667 --> 03:55.234
See, it works with everything.

03:55.236 --> 03:56.535
Does it?

03:56.537 --> 03:59.004
Okay, you keep up
the good simulating, huh?

03:59.006 --> 04:00.672
(chuckles)

04:00.674 --> 04:02.507
Hey, guys.

04:02.509 --> 04:03.842
Any, uh, leads?

04:03.844 --> 04:05.010
Nothing yet.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.378
Everything seems
so similar,

04:06.380 --> 04:07.779
and without any
medical training,

04:07.781 --> 04:09.281
it's hard to pin down.

04:10.216 --> 04:11.683
Yeah, even doctors misdiagnose.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.619
I once had a bunion removed.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.721
Turned out it was a sixth toe.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.522
How's Melissa doing?

04:17.524 --> 04:19.358
Not great. You know,
I-I got a baby monitor

04:19.360 --> 04:20.926
so I can keep an eye on her.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.294
Oh, I think
the screen's broken.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.229
Looks like it's frozen there.
ERICA: Yeah.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.465
No, she's just standing there.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.267
Oh, my God.
You know, we might not

04:28.269 --> 04:29.901
want to rule out
a standard possession.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.571
This has all the tell-tale signs
of a conjuring.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.140
Maybe we just keep it to
the, uh, medical world for now.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.042
It could be
general psychosis.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.744
Oh, well, what are
the symptoms of that?

04:38.746 --> 04:40.412
Detachment from reality,

04:40.414 --> 04:42.247
putting oneself and
others in danger,

04:42.249 --> 04:43.815
childlike regression.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.785
TANDY:
Good afternoon, Vietnam!

04:46.787 --> 04:49.254
Hey-oh!

04:49.256 --> 04:50.922
Never mind. I think the
odds of two people

04:50.924 --> 04:52.324
in the group having
that are slim.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.725
Made a little run
to the pharmacy,

04:53.727 --> 04:55.560
and I think I might have just
come up with a little solution.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.662
What are those?

04:56.664 --> 04:57.763
Pills.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.097
Pills? What pills?

04:59.099 --> 05:01.066
Just a classic mix and match.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.335
So now we're just gonna give her
a bunch of random drugs?

05:03.337 --> 05:06.505
Eh, it's kind of a "you know it
when you see it" situation.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.174
Hmm. Looks like he
got some Lexapro,

05:09.176 --> 05:11.843
Zoloft, Prozac,
Celexa, Paxil,

05:11.845 --> 05:13.645
Luvox, Latuda.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.181
I've dabbled.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.816
Tandy, we can't make
her take pills.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.017
What about shock therapy?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.118
(sighs)

05:20.120 --> 05:22.020
It worked wonders
on my grandma.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.955
My grandpa always said
that before,

05:23.957 --> 05:26.091
she was like,
"Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,"

05:26.093 --> 05:28.293
and then afterwards,
nothing.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.594
TODD: Guys, we're not
giving her drugs.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.363
Okay? Or shock therapy.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.498
I mean, come on,
this is ridiculous!

05:33.500 --> 05:35.200
Todders, what's wrong?

05:35.202 --> 05:37.502
Seriously? We don't know
what we're doing,

05:37.504 --> 05:39.538
and we never will;
we're not doctors.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.106
Hey, we'll figure it out.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.541
Oh, we'll figure it out?

05:42.543 --> 05:45.043
Like we figured out how to
do an appendectomy on Phil?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.712
Yeah, that
worked out great.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.214
Or we are just gonna figure
it out when babies start

05:49.216 --> 05:50.482
popping out of
that one. Huh?

05:50.484 --> 05:52.217
Or that one?

05:52.219 --> 05:55.053
Look, all the women in my family
needed C-sections.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.388
All of them.

05:56.390 --> 05:59.224
What are we gonna do
if one of them needs one?

05:59.226 --> 06:00.559
Huh?

06:00.561 --> 06:01.960
Wake up, bud.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.695
It's all going south.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.573
Hey, Lewis!
(screams)

06:14.575 --> 06:17.075
Come on, get that nose up, bud!
Level those wings!

06:17.077 --> 06:19.044
Straighten up and fly right.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.912
Or left. You choose.
You're the pilot.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.247
Whoa!

06:23.149 --> 06:24.416
(laughs)

06:24.418 --> 06:26.418
You don't see that up in
the air every day, huh?

06:26.420 --> 06:27.853
What do you want, Tandy?

06:27.855 --> 06:30.822
I want you to put that thing
in park and come out with me.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.191
I got a little present for you.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.260
(siren wailing)

06:37.730 --> 06:40.399
And... ta-da!

06:40.401 --> 06:42.200
(chuckles)

06:42.202 --> 06:43.602
What's going on?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.871
What's going on is
you're ready.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.572
Ready for what?

06:47.574 --> 06:51.276
Your first flight... now.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.549
You want me to fly
that thing?

06:57.551 --> 07:00.185
I've only flown
in a simulator.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.787
Do you think
that Amelia Earhart

07:01.789 --> 07:04.055
had a bunch of cracks at it
in a simulator?

07:04.057 --> 07:06.458
No. She just got into
a plane and wung it.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.794
Amelia Earhart crashed
and died, Tandy.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.095
Uh, we don't know that.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.264
She might have got into
a jogging accident, right?

07:12.266 --> 07:15.133
Look, what are you getting
so worked up about, huh?

07:15.135 --> 07:17.436
I mean, it's very well known

07:17.438 --> 07:19.571
that flying is the safest
form of travel, right?

07:19.573 --> 07:21.640
I mean, we had way more
of a chance of dying

07:21.642 --> 07:22.908
on the drive over here.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.476
It's simple statistics.
(sighs)

07:24.478 --> 07:26.111
Do those statistics
take into account

07:26.113 --> 07:27.946
someone who's
never flown before?

07:27.948 --> 07:29.147
Yes, they do.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.982
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.484
Yes, I do, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.386
Oh, you didn't know this.
I never told you this.

07:34.388 --> 07:37.789
I used to, uh,
be a travel statistician.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.090
You were a temp.

07:39.092 --> 07:43.895
Yes, I... at a...
a travel statisticiary.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.430
Sorry, Tandy,
not doing this.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.499
Yeah, Lewis, wait.
W-Wait. Look.

07:47.501 --> 07:51.436
Melissa's sick, Todd's a mess,
and, like, Carol and Erica--

07:51.438 --> 07:54.339
they're freaking out now
about C-sections.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.975
And how does me flying
make any of that better?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.910
If we get you up into a plane,

07:58.912 --> 08:01.179
there's a chance
that you could find someone.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.015
And who knows? Maybe that
someone could be a doctor.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.984
I don't know.
It seems like long shot, Tandy.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.352
Yeah, it's a friggin'
long shot,

08:07.354 --> 08:11.056
but we're fresh out
of short shots, bud.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.825
Look,

08:13.827 --> 08:17.529
this is gonna be scary
whenever you decide to do it,

08:17.531 --> 08:21.166
but you got to take
that leap one day.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.368
Why not today?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.003
(sighs)

08:25.005 --> 08:26.671
It is a nice plane.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.974
Yeah, it is, sure.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.542
And I have put the time in.

08:30.544 --> 08:33.545
Tremendous amount
of time in there.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.280
And I guess
the sooner I get flying,

08:35.282 --> 08:36.982
the sooner I get back to Mark.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.717
There you go.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.986
Solid logic.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.687
(sighs)

08:42.689 --> 08:44.623
