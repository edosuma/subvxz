00:03.870 --> 00:06.498
<i>Welcome to day two
of a very special Tool Time.</i>

00:06.573 --> 00:08.507
We're live from Al's apartment.

00:08.575 --> 00:11.738
Now, here's the star of the show,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

00:11.811 --> 00:16.305
Thank you. Welcome to our second day,
in Al's apartment, lovely isn't it?

00:16.383 --> 00:18.408
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor,

00:18.485 --> 00:21.215
of course you all
know my assistant, Al Borland.

00:21.321 --> 00:23.289
- Al?
- What?

00:24.257 --> 00:26.020
- We're on the air, Al.
- What?!

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:42.642 --> 00:44.803
You could've given me
some warning.

00:44.911 --> 00:47.038
Where would the fun be in that?

00:49.215 --> 00:52.878
This week we've been showing you
how to turn the dead space in your house

00:52.952 --> 00:54.112
into living space.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.688
Today's challenge is
how to turn the dead space

00:56.756 --> 01:00.123
between Al's ears into
a nice bric-a-brac room.

01:01.461 --> 01:04.897
The dead space between your ears
could fill the Mall of America.

01:08.635 --> 01:12.196
Today, we'll be installing
a sliding pocket door in Al's bathroom.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.638
First, let me show you
what we did yesterday.

01:14.741 --> 01:18.006
We used this space in the wall...
to put in a spice rack.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.412
- Al.
- Right.

01:19.512 --> 01:22.413
Then we converted this space
that used to be my closet,

01:22.482 --> 01:23.972
into a guest bedroom.

01:24.050 --> 01:25.574
- Remote control.
- Tim.

01:29.289 --> 01:33.726
Next, we'll try to convert some poor sap
into Al's first house guest.

01:36.329 --> 01:39.765
And then we'll convert that stuff
on your face into an actual beard.

01:44.070 --> 01:47.039
Gee, Al, not everyone
can grow a beard as fast as your mom.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.973
Now the pièce de résistance.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.605
In the spare room above
the header in the kitchen,

01:54.681 --> 01:56.945
we have a home entertainment system.

01:59.552 --> 02:03.283
With this set up,
my guests can now watch TV in bed.

02:03.356 --> 02:05.517
- Not with that remote, though, Al.
- Whoa!

02:12.532 --> 02:15.160
Hey! I don't go in
for that sort of thing!

03:11.357 --> 03:13.917
Mom, can you sew
these buttons on my shirt?

03:14.761 --> 03:17.696
Eww, they're little skulls.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.023
Yeah. How fast can you do it?

03:22.535 --> 03:25.368
Well, I'm kinda busy,
but I assure you

03:25.438 --> 03:26.962
that sewing demonic symbols

03:27.040 --> 03:30.339
on my sors clothing will be
right at the top of my list.

03:32.512 --> 03:34.537
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

03:35.181 --> 03:38.742
What are you doing with my thesaurus?
I've been looking for this all day!

03:38.818 --> 03:42.254
<i>I borrowed it for a report I'm doing,
The Selfish Middle Class.</i>

03:43.356 --> 03:45.688
Randy. Randy, this is
my work station.

03:45.758 --> 03:48.522
You can't just come
and grab anything you want.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.596
Hey, it is not my fault.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.598
I'm a product of
the selfish middle class.

03:56.936 --> 03:58.494
What're you doing?

03:58.571 --> 04:01.540
I'm at the dining room table,
I'm... dining.

04:02.275 --> 04:05.836
Well, now it's sort of my office,
so, would you dine somewhere else?

04:05.912 --> 04:07.174
Alright.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.148
- Oh, my God! My paper!
- I'm sorry. I'll clean it.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.377
Or I could dine in my room.

04:14.454 --> 04:17.821
I think that's a good idea. Good idea.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.653
- Hi, honey.
- Tim?

04:19.759 --> 04:21.692
I'm having a really bad day.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.524
Nice talking to you.

04:25.465 --> 04:27.330
Tim...

04:27.400 --> 04:29.766
...I want you
to build me something.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.072
I've been trying to work
on this paper all day.

04:36.142 --> 04:37.905
I can't get a moment's peace here.

04:38.011 --> 04:41.572
I just need a quiet private place
where I can get things done.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.249
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

04:44.317 --> 04:47.343
You want something built,
and you want me to build it?

04:48.588 --> 04:50.317
- Yeah.
- Yes!

04:52.458 --> 04:54.483
- I want an office.
- Office...

04:54.560 --> 04:57.256
A place to close the door
and get away from everybody.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.490
- Get away.
- Yeah.

04:58.564 --> 05:01.328
I was thinking
that you could convert the...

05:01.401 --> 05:02.561
- Attic!
- Right!

05:02.635 --> 05:04.398
Hey.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.836
Oh, oh!

05:08.141 --> 05:11.110
I've dreamed about this day
since the moment I met you.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.543
We didn't have an attic
the day we met.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.777
Which makes the dream
all that more significant.

05:17.917 --> 05:21.785
- You're not toying with me, are you?
- No. On one condition.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.585
You keep it simple.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.955
You want simple...

05:28.027 --> 05:29.790
...you got your man.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.194
- See ya, Tim.
- Wait.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.532
I got this from the attic,
remember this?

05:40.540 --> 05:43.236
I wore it to a wedding,
but I can't remember whose.

05:43.309 --> 05:45.573
Yeah, it was our wedding. Bye.

05:45.645 --> 05:49.376
Wait. There's just a few more
things I gotta ask you. Hold on.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.940
Just a few decisions.
Paint or wallpaper?

05:52.018 --> 05:54.077
Paint. I gotta go to therapy, honey.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.678
- Flat, semi-gloss, or matte?
- Uh, surprise me.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.656
- Carpet or wood floor?
- Carpeting.

05:58.725 --> 06:01.091
OK, plush, saxony or berber?

06:01.194 --> 06:04.527
- I don't care!
- Wait, take a paint sample with you.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.099
Ow!

06:07.934 --> 06:09.265
Sorry!

06:11.437 --> 06:14.133
I understand you are
a student at the university.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.368
Yes, I am, uh...

06:16.476 --> 06:19.536
...taking therapy is a,
a part of my master's requirement.

06:19.612 --> 06:22.479
- Aha.
- I don't have much to talk about.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.879
Oh, that's OK.

06:23.950 --> 06:27.215
Why don't you just tell me
a little about yourself.

06:27.286 --> 06:29.846
Oh, oh, OK. Um...

06:30.423 --> 06:35.292
...well, I just hit 40, and I'm trying
to jumpstart a new career, and...

06:35.361 --> 06:38.728
I don't know which I'll get first,
my diploma or menopause.

06:43.202 --> 06:47.263
I have three sons, each of whom
is the center of his own universe.

06:47.340 --> 06:51.674
Brad is driving, which worries me,
Randy questions everything we stand for,

06:51.744 --> 06:55.441
and Mark... he's the youngest one,

06:55.515 --> 06:58.678
wears only black and is possibly
worshipping the devil.

07:00.052 --> 07:02.987
- Well, Jill...
- No, no, there's more, there's more.

07:03.055 --> 07:08.186
You see, I am completely overwhelmed.
My father died six months ago,

07:08.261 --> 07:11.287
I'm helping my mother long distance
which is not working.

07:11.364 --> 07:15.232
I'm running a house, going to school
and leading my own counseling groups,

07:15.301 --> 07:19.533
I'm having some people over for dinner
and I have no idea what to make them.

07:19.605 --> 07:24.099
She likes fish, he likes chicken.
When I cook it all tastes the same.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.938
You know, maybe I take on too much

07:30.016 --> 07:33.850
because I don't know why I'm having
people over in the middle of the week.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.787
Well, Jill, it seems to me
that there's, uh... more.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.619
Yeah, well...

07:39.192 --> 07:42.093
...this is only about ten percent
of my problems.

07:42.161 --> 07:45.130
The other 90 percent...
I'm married, too.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.561
You see, my husband, he's going through
this sort of midlife crisis thing,

07:51.637 --> 07:54.128
"Who am I? Where am I?
Should I grow a beard?

07:54.207 --> 07:55.765
Should I buy a hunting lodge?"

07:55.875 --> 07:59.902
And then, today Brad spilled a soda
on my paper, Mark's asking for skulls,

07:59.979 --> 08:02.743
and before I knew it,
I was asking my husband

08:02.815 --> 08:06.251
to start construction
on an office.

08:09.622 --> 08:12.489
What's wrong with your husband
building you an office?

08:12.558 --> 08:14.583
I'm married to Tim Taylor.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.789
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor?

08:20.967 --> 08:24.698
Yeah, and maybe you'd better
switch to a tape recorder here.

08:25.471 --> 08:28.167
I hope I have enough batteries.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.472
You are so beautiful.

08:32.544 --> 08:35.480
I mean, I... I get excited
every time I see you.

08:36.782 --> 08:39.080
You feel so good.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.620
Would, uh, you and your drywall
like some time alone?

08:48.461 --> 08:52.090
I hope one day you find something that
makes you as happy as this makes me.

08:52.164 --> 08:55.327
Yeah, me, too. I just hope
mine has a head and breathes.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.567
Now, think about it, son. Look at this.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.607
You have a dirty attic,
disgusting, dusty... and a dream.

09:01.707 --> 09:05.006
You fulfill your dream with the sweat
of your brow and your hands.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.170
Huh?

09:08.347 --> 09:10.281
I'll, uh, stick with girls.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.544
It's like talkin to a wall.

09:17.924 --> 09:20.893
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late,
therapy ran over.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.656
Um, we need to talk
about the construction.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.959
Hey, I always got time for that.

09:26.032 --> 09:29.126
Picked up all the materials
down at Harry Hardware.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.102
They all tell me I've got
the remodeling glow.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.140
Um, Tim, I've given it
some serious thought...

09:37.243 --> 09:39.803
- OK.
...and I really don't want the office.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.437
Preconstruction jitters.

09:41.547 --> 09:43.640
- Everyone gets them.
- No, no, no, no, no.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.843
- Life is chaotic lately...
- Yeah.

09:45.918 --> 09:49.479
One of the things I just learned in
therapy is that I need to simplify.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.681
You see...

09:50.756 --> 09:54.123
I take on way too much as a way of
not dealing with my feelings,

09:54.193 --> 09:56.753
and this office is gonna be
just way too much.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.159
You asked me to do it.

09:58.230 --> 10:02.462
Why would you ask me to do it,
unless you really wanted me to?

10:02.535 --> 10:06.301
Because for a brief, fleeting instant,
I thought it was a good idea,

10:06.372 --> 10:10.399
but then you bombarded me with
decorating decisions and blueprints...

10:10.476 --> 10:13.570
Ok, whoa, forget that.
I'll make the decisions, it's over.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.136
No, no, no. Tim.

10:15.214 --> 10:19.310
Tim, I have problems
with this office on a... deeper level.

10:20.386 --> 10:23.321
Ahh, sub-flooring, huh?

10:25.691 --> 10:27.591
No. No, no.

10:27.660 --> 10:30.527
I, I really don't want to be
so isolated from everybody

10:30.596 --> 10:34.225
and when I get my office someday,
I need it to be a place

10:34.300 --> 10:37.736
where patients can come, and
people can't traipse through the house.

10:37.803 --> 10:41.830
Problem solved. I'll build a stairway
on the outside of the house up to the...

10:41.907 --> 10:45.070
No, Tim, you're not listening to me.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.338
I don't want a staircase
on the outside,

10:47.413 --> 10:49.677
I don't want an office in the attic.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.876
What are you saying?

10:53.352 --> 10:55.980
I don't want an office
in the attic!

10:57.156 --> 10:59.124
Sheesh.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.633
I'm getting the idea
you don't want me to build this thing.

11:08.267 --> 11:11.327
- And I asked you not to toy with me.
- Yeah.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.770
I begged you not
to toy with me, and yet,

11:13.873 --> 11:15.738
you toyed.

11:15.808 --> 11:18.368
I know. I made a mistake.

11:18.444 --> 11:22.403
A mistake I'm very sorry for and
will obviously never hear the end of.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.882
But, Patty and Doug are coming
over for dinner and I need your help.

11:25.951 --> 11:29.284
I can't be around people
after I've been fired off a job.

11:30.756 --> 11:33.657
Tim, you're my husband,
not my contractor.

11:33.726 --> 11:36.092
For a brief, fleeting moment,
I was both.

11:36.162 --> 11:38.323
- You're ridiculous.
- You're ridiculous!

11:38.431 --> 11:40.899
Your life's chaotic,
you want to simplify it?

11:40.966 --> 11:42.831
Stop having stupid dinner parties.

11:42.902 --> 11:46.633
This is the first one in six months.
I haven't had time because of school.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.799
You want to streamline?
Quit school!

11:48.874 --> 11:50.705
- So you can build the office?
- Yes!

11:50.776 --> 11:52.505
If I quit school, I don't need one.

11:52.578 --> 11:55.741
Don't use all that fancy
psychological stuff with me.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.575
- I have to make dinner.
- You have to make dinner?

12:00.653 --> 12:02.621
Where do I put this stuff I just bought?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.383
I can think of a real good place.

12:30.282 --> 12:33.581
This fish is really good.
it's not too fishy.

12:33.652 --> 12:35.517
That's cause it's chicken, Doug.

12:39.091 --> 12:42.959
Well, it's delicious.
it's not too chickeny.

12:43.796 --> 12:47.288
Well, Jill, you didn't tell me,
how was your first therapy session?

12:49.635 --> 12:51.728
Fine. Potatoes?

12:51.804 --> 12:54.967
Well, how did you like Dr. Breen?
Was he insightful?

12:55.040 --> 12:58.498
He certainly incited a number of
things around here, I'll tell you.

12:59.912 --> 13:04.542
Yeah? I've been picking up some tension.
Everything alright?

13:04.617 --> 13:07.882
I don't think that's our business.
Why don't we change the subject?

13:07.953 --> 13:09.648
Gotcha.

13:11.690 --> 13:16.024
So, Jill, I hear Tim's building you
a great office up in the attic.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.255
Lima beans?

13:20.332 --> 13:22.596
Well, she asked me
to build her an office,

13:22.668 --> 13:26.297
I did all the plans, bought the
materials, then she changed her mind.

13:26.372 --> 13:29.671
Tim, we don't really have to discuss
this in front of our guests.

13:29.742 --> 13:33.769
Why not? You ashamed of your behavior?
Afraid people might judge you?

13:37.216 --> 13:39.446
Say, is that a beard you're growing?

13:43.455 --> 13:44.786
Yes, it is, Doug.

13:44.857 --> 13:48.315
I promised pookie over there
that I'd shave it off,

13:48.394 --> 13:52.125
but my life has become so chaotic,
I... I might change my mind.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.802
You're really not gonna
let this go, are you?

13:56.869 --> 13:59.804
You were really willing
to let my drywall go, werert you?

13:59.872 --> 14:03.035
You are so unbelievable. All you
talk about is stupid drywall.

14:03.142 --> 14:06.441
- That's how she talks about drywall.
- You're so self-absorbed.

14:06.512 --> 14:10.471
I'm self-absorbed, Miss I-Pay-A-Guy-
To-Hear-Me-Talk-About-Myself?

14:10.583 --> 14:13.245
Tim, I don't have the
time or the energy for this.

14:13.319 --> 14:15.480
If it's so important,
build the damn office.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.614
You'd like that?
I won't give you the satisfaction.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.125
So, how's Mark doing in Spanish?

14:22.428 --> 14:25.864
Well, your needs are obviously so much
more important than mine,

14:25.931 --> 14:27.899
if it makes you feel better, do it.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.936
I wouldn't pick up a hammer
if you got down and begged me.

14:31.003 --> 14:35.133
I love construction, but the Tool Man
draws a line at a mercy build.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.532
I give up!

14:39.945 --> 14:42.505
- You know this chicken could be pork.
- Mm-hm.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.926
He slept down here all night?

14:55.027 --> 14:56.187
Half the night.

14:56.295 --> 14:59.560
The other half he and Mom
were yelling at each other.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.260
She catch him
making out with the drywall?

15:05.304 --> 15:08.068
She told him he couldn't
build the office in the attic.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.506
My God, is he still breathing?

15:12.111 --> 15:15.444
Yeah, but what's the point?
His soul's been stripped away.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.613
But his beard sure is
coming in nice.

15:23.722 --> 15:26.486
Looks like he's got another one
growing in his ears.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.963
- Hi, Wilson.
- Well, hi-ho, neighbor.

15:38.037 --> 15:40.665
So, how's Jill's office coming?

15:40.739 --> 15:42.172
Come and gone.

15:42.241 --> 15:45.108
She backed out
right after she saw her shrink.

15:45.177 --> 15:48.078
Whoa. So you were
destroyed by Freud.

15:50.316 --> 15:53.479
- I guess you could say that. Yeah.
- Hung by Jung.

15:55.254 --> 15:58.189
- Yeah.
- Brought to a halt by Gestalt.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.087
Could we? I'm hurting here.

16:02.161 --> 16:05.824
This meant a lot to me, I put a lot of
hours in, started to miter stuff up.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.423
Next, we're in a fight
I'm sleeping on the couch.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.401
Well, it seems to me since
the office was for Jill,

16:11.470 --> 16:14.234
it's her prerogative if she wants
to change her mind.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.035
Yada, yada, yada.

16:17.009 --> 16:20.911
When I'm building stuff,
I lose myself in the job, you know?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.881
This was very important to me.

16:23.949 --> 16:27.112
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.581
- I being selfish.
- No, no, no.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.681
I'm thinking that you remind me
of one of my great heroes...

16:32.758 --> 16:34.419
- Yeah?
...Jefferson.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.256
- He was one of my heroes.
- Oh?

16:36.328 --> 16:40.230
When that guy started, he had one dry
cleaner. Next thing he was moving on up.

16:45.237 --> 16:48.570
- I'm confused.
- George Jefferson.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.939
His wife's name was Weezie.

16:52.011 --> 16:56.175
No, no, no, Tim.
I'm talking about Thomas Jefferson.

16:56.281 --> 16:59.842
You know, he was a man
that needed to work with his hands.

16:59.952 --> 17:03.581
When he was home at Monticello,
he'd lose himself building his house,

17:03.655 --> 17:08.092
tending his garden, and it was while
doing these simple hands-on tasks,

17:08.160 --> 17:10.492
that Jefferson saw
his life more clearly.

17:10.561 --> 17:12.621
Hey, wow.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.426
- I am like Jefferson.
- Mm-hm.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.128
When I'm swinging the hammer, that's
when I see and think the clearest.

17:18.203 --> 17:21.638
That's probably why building
Jill's office was so important to you.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.540
I never really thought of it that way.

17:24.609 --> 17:27.374
- Thanks, Wilson.
- Mm-hm. Tim, you growing a beard?

17:29.615 --> 17:32.379
- What do you think?
- Well, I'm not sure.

17:32.451 --> 17:35.784
I could never understand why
a man would want to hide his face.

17:42.227 --> 17:45.094
- Are you almost done?
- Oh, yeah.

17:45.164 --> 17:50.067
You're gonna have the snazziest-looking
skulls in the seventh grade.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.634
They're not supposed to be snazzy.

17:55.140 --> 17:59.042
I was being facetious. I think they're
hideous and completely twisted.

17:59.878 --> 18:01.641
Alright.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.809
Honey, honey, honey.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.976
I figured something out
you should know.

18:07.052 --> 18:10.021
- And what would that be?
- I am like Jefferson.

18:11.323 --> 18:13.382
Tom, not George.

18:13.992 --> 18:16.051
- I'll need more.
- OK.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.289
I wanted to build
the office space for you.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.364
Yeah...

18:19.465 --> 18:21.899
But, in many ways,
I was building it for myself.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.902
You know how at therapy,
you worked out how you were feeling?

18:24.970 --> 18:26.335
- Yeah.
- OK.

18:26.405 --> 18:29.272
Well... building things
is like that for me.

18:29.341 --> 18:32.208
When I work with tools
I get a chance to think things out,

18:32.277 --> 18:34.438
- sort through stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

18:34.546 --> 18:37.879
Stuff we're going through, maybe,
or, like, the kids.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.850
Do you remember when, um...

18:39.918 --> 18:43.445
...I, I blew up that water heater?
- The first or the second time?

18:45.324 --> 18:47.224
- It would be the second time.
- Oh.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.953
Well, I, uh, I realized then that

18:49.027 --> 18:52.588
I wasrt as happy as I thought I'd be
about Brad getting his license.

18:52.698 --> 18:55.030
- I thought you were thrilled.
- I was at first.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.568
When he got it,
he was driving, he was never home.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.503
- I never saw him.
- I didn't know you felt that way.

19:00.572 --> 19:03.939
Wow. OK. So...
you're saying that...

19:04.009 --> 19:07.069
...whenever you build something,
or, uh, blow it up,

19:08.814 --> 19:12.477
it comes with
an equally valuable insight.

19:13.051 --> 19:16.077
Valuable on many levels.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.920
The first time
I blew up that water heater...

19:21.527 --> 19:23.188
...I realized that...

19:23.862 --> 19:25.625
...I could do this.

19:35.207 --> 19:38.574
Well... Tim, I'm really glad
you shared that with me.

19:40.646 --> 19:42.136
You know, just because...

19:42.214 --> 19:46.378
...my life is chaotic and confusing
right now, you shouldn't have to suffer.

19:46.485 --> 19:48.453
Would you please write that down?

19:49.521 --> 19:51.250
I've been thinking...

19:51.990 --> 19:54.515
...you know how you've
wanted to redo the garage?

19:54.593 --> 19:56.220
I think you should do that.

20:00.432 --> 20:03.765
Are you toying with me?
I can only take so much of this toying.

20:04.770 --> 20:08.729
I'm not toying with you. It'd be perfect
because it's building for yourself.

20:08.807 --> 20:12.573
- Alright.
- Then someday, when things calm down,

20:12.678 --> 20:15.203
I'll let you build me
the office of your dreams.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.908
The glow is starting to come back.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.346
It'd be a lot easier to see
if you'd shave.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.752
It's, it's softer now
than it was a couple days ago.

20:26.825 --> 20:29.055
- Let me feel.
- Hmm?

20:29.628 --> 20:31.653
It's softer.

20:33.865 --> 20:36.800
- I hate when we fight.
- Oh, me, too.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.629
It's not just 'cause
the couch is lumpy, either.

20:42.441 --> 20:46.537
I couldn't stand it last night when
I rolled over and you werert there.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.375
It could've been worse.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.244
I rolled over here
and I landed on the nutcracker.

20:55.454 --> 20:58.617
That baby lives up
to it's name, I'll tell you that.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.988
Tim, you promised me
you'd help with dinner.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.225
Just finished shaving, honey.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.891
You did?

21:10.969 --> 21:12.596
It took longer than I thought.

21:20.912 --> 21:22.675
I'm kidding.

21:29.121 --> 21:32.056
Problem solved. I'll put
an outside staircase in for you.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.024
No. No, no. Tim, you're not listening.

21:34.092 --> 21:37.653
I don't want an outside staircase.
I don't want an attic in the office.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.166
I...

21:43.235 --> 21:44.668
Yeah.

21:45.437 --> 21:46.995
Let's get back again.

21:47.072 --> 21:48.596
I don't believe this.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.236
See, I stopped it.

21:57.049 --> 22:00.541
- That was going so well.
- I can't take these baboons laughing.
