NO!

21:16.175 --> 21:17.108
(<i> playing squeakily</i> )

21:17.110 --> 21:20.711
OKAY, I REALLY
DON'T WANT TO
HEAR ANOTHER ONE.

21:20.713 --> 21:21.612
OKAY.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.380
(<i> tooting</i> )

21:22.382 --> 21:25.349
I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO HEAR MORE,
THANK YOU.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.118
I HEAR YOU
LOUD AND CLEAR.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.286
(<i> tooting</i> )

21:28.288 --> 21:29.320
Squidward:
STOP!

21:29.322 --> 21:30.855
GET AWAY FROM HER!

21:30.857 --> 21:33.824
OH, OH, I AM SO SORRY, MA'AM.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.360
I-I HOPE THESE
TWO BARNACLE-HEADS

21:36.362 --> 21:38.863
HAVEN'T HARMED YOU IN ANY WAY.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.264
WHO ARE YOU?

21:40.266 --> 21:43.834
WHY, I'M SQUIDWARD.

21:44.470 --> 21:48.339
WHAT KIND OF FOOL
DO YOU TAKE ME FOR?

21:48.341 --> 21:49.340
HE'S SQUIDWARD?

21:49.342 --> 21:50.308
HE'S SQUIDWARD?

21:50.310 --> 21:51.742
YOU'RE SQUIDWARD?

21:51.744 --> 21:52.810
I'M SQUIDWARD!

21:52.812 --> 21:54.779
ARE THERE ANY
OTHER SQUIDWARDS?

21:54.781 --> 21:56.781
(<i> in Squidward's voice</i> ):
MEOW.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.450
I'M OUT OF HERE.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.951
MA'AM, PLEASE.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.420
WHAT ABOUT MY HOUSE?

22:02.422 --> 22:04.422
I WOULDN'T SELL A HOUSE FOR YOU

22:04.424 --> 22:07.858
IF YOU WERE
THE LAST SQUIDWARD ON EARTH!

22:07.860 --> 22:08.893
WAIT!

22:08.895 --> 22:09.960
DON'T...

22:09.962 --> 22:10.761
GO!

22:10.763 --> 22:11.896
(<i> screams</i> )

22:11.898 --> 22:15.199
NO, NO, NO!

22:15.201 --> 22:17.568
PLEASE SELL MY HOUSE.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.070
NEVER!

22:19.672 --> 22:22.473
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!

22:22.475 --> 22:24.008
(<i> crying</i> )

22:24.010 --> 22:27.144
Both:
HAPPY OPPOSITE DAY, SQUIDWARD.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.814
WE HATE YOU.

22:30.350 --> 22:37.788
LET ME SHOW YOU GUYS
HOW MUCH I HATE YOU.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.657
(<i> engine revs</i> )

22:39.659 --> 22:41.792
(<i> yelling</i> )

22:41.794 --> 22:42.960
PATRICK, YOU EVER FEEL

22:42.962 --> 22:45.162
THAT SQUIDWARD
