00:51.252 --> 00:52.220
Hi.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.421
Oh hey, how are you?

00:53.454 --> 00:54.588
Good, how are you?

00:54.622 --> 00:56.990
Good. So, the total is $14.65

00:57.024 --> 00:58.992
Great. Thank you, so much.

00:59.026 --> 00:59.860
Heh-hey.

01:03.231 --> 01:07.401
Hey! There are two pieces
missing from this pizza.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.605
That is our PAC-MAN deal.

01:11.639 --> 01:12.873
Where we make a whole pizza,

01:12.906 --> 01:14.108
we take a couple slices out of it

01:14.142 --> 01:15.643
and it looks like a PAC-MAN monster.

01:15.676 --> 01:16.744
No, that's bullshit.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.512
I can see the food in
your beard from here.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.614
You're disgusting,
I'm calling your boss.

01:20.648 --> 01:21.449
No no no.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.383
Don't do that, don't do that.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.951
I'll give you a discount
on the pizza, $15.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.886
That's what it costs originally.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.087
No, this is the discount.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.957
$10 for the pizza, $5 for the tip.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.328
Hey Clark, are you home early?

01:34.362 --> 01:36.029
Yeah, I got fired.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.300
Oh no, what happened?

01:40.268 --> 01:41.902
Well, I got a little
hungry after working

01:41.935 --> 01:43.103
for three hours straight.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.905
And ate a couple slices of pizza.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.376
Everybody got mad and yelled at me.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.144
I'm so sorry.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.446
Well, so I'm gonna be a
little bit late with the rent.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.414
Hey, don't worry about it.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.748
I know how hard this job market is

01:54.782 --> 01:58.819
and I'll cover this month
and we'll put it on your tab.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.621
I have some money saved
up and once you get back

02:00.654 --> 02:02.122
on your feet you can pay me back.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.657
Sound like a deal?

02:05.092 --> 02:06.494
Yeah, I guess that sounds fair.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.928
But I don't want you jumping in there

02:07.961 --> 02:10.497
as soon as I get a job and
asking for all your money back.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.833
Give me some time to build up a savings.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.503
I don't know, pay some bills.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.305
Get some walking around money.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.138
Et cetera.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.106
Yeah, I know I know.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.541
Just don't ride my ass
when I get that job.

02:20.574 --> 02:21.609
I know, I know.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.177
I need some cushion time.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.279
Three, six, nine months even.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.715
Completely get it.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.917
Oh, hey hey!

02:29.950 --> 02:30.918
This is my work.

02:30.951 --> 02:31.819
Then leave it at work.

02:31.852 --> 02:32.886
I can't.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.154
I gotta get the paperwork
done for these cases.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.056
Gah, you are the most
boring police officer

02:36.089 --> 02:38.292
I have ever met in my entire life.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.760
This is just temporary.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.862
Once I've passed the academy
I'm going to

02:41.895 --> 02:42.996
be out on the street.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.434
Isn't that what you said last year?

02:46.467 --> 02:48.569
Sorry, I'm being a dick.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.838
Come on, let's get going.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.475
Let's get you applying
for some jobs online.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.409
We're gonna get you a job.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.410
No thanks.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.379
I think I'm just gonna
drink until I pass out.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.880
Why don't you come see
me for lunch tomorrow?

02:59.913 --> 03:00.714
No.

03:00.748 --> 03:01.549
My treat?

03:01.582 --> 03:02.416
Okay.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.851
Have you looked for any jobs today?

03:03.884 --> 03:05.219
No.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.053
Listen, Clark.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.020
I'm here to support you.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.256
And I wanna help you out, buddy.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.557
But, you gotta try.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.658
I am trying.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.125
No, you're not really.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.827
You haven't even looked
for any jobs today.

03:13.861 --> 03:14.962
Yeah, but I woke up.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.398
And that's a pretty good start.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.433
I have a friend and she
manages a call-center.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.001
If I set up an interview, would you go?

03:21.034 --> 03:21.869
I guess.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.205
What are you doing?

03:25.239 --> 03:26.039
Getting ahold of her.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.441
No no, you can't do that now.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.876
You gotta prepare for something
like this.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.544
You know I've got a lot
of sleeping to catch up on

03:30.578 --> 03:31.679
and stuff like that.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.448
Oh! They let you out of
the office during the day?

03:34.482 --> 03:36.884
Yeah, what moron's
stuffing paper into envelopes

03:36.917 --> 03:37.851
with you gone?

03:39.720 --> 03:40.888
Ha ha ha ha!

03:41.955 --> 03:43.657
That's so great guys.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.960
Like, I'm like a, like I'm
gonna go out, sniff the air.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.162
And I'm gonna go to
the bathroom and stuff.

03:49.196 --> 03:49.997
You know like...

03:50.030 --> 03:51.064
You shit outside?

03:51.098 --> 03:53.367
No, like I'm an Aleutian
working dog, you know?

03:53.401 --> 03:54.502
Yeah, dog's shit outside.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.769
Look, my partner here
doesn't understand metaphors.

03:55.803 --> 03:56.670
Nuh-ah.

03:56.704 --> 03:57.605
In his defense, your face does look

03:57.638 --> 03:59.307
like somebody that'd love
to poop outside.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.741
What the hell is going on here?

04:00.774 --> 04:01.942
Whoa! Whoa!

04:01.975 --> 04:02.810
Pipe down.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.314
Clark, this is Garibaldi and Betts.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.882
We were in the academy
together like three years ago.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.719
Remind me, was that the
first time or second time

04:11.752 --> 04:12.686
that you failed?

04:12.720 --> 04:13.587
Second time.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.055
What's this?

04:16.089 --> 04:16.890
Oh, no no.

04:16.923 --> 04:17.725
That's not...

04:17.757 --> 04:18.559
You don't need to..

04:18.591 --> 04:19.560
Ah, comic books?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.362
What, uh, two year-old
did you jack those from?

04:21.394 --> 04:23.664
Two year-olds can't read.

04:23.697 --> 04:24.865
Yeah, some can.

04:24.898 --> 04:25.866
No, none can.

04:25.899 --> 04:26.934
Super smart ones can.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.001
Yeah dude.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.169
Yeah, super smart ones can.

04:30.170 --> 04:30.971
We gotta go.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.406
Cop shit.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.374
Goodbye guys.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.308
Get a razor.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.175
Shut up.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.547
They're so cool.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.482
The hell was that?

04:41.515 --> 04:42.316
What, those guys are cool.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.116
Cool?

04:43.150 --> 04:44.151
Those guys were dicks.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.486
No, we're just always
razzing each other.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.620
You know, poking fun.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.755
That's how cops are.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.757
That conversation consisted
of them giving you shit.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.059
You making some weird terrible joke

04:52.092 --> 04:53.561
about being a dog or something?

04:53.594 --> 04:55.195
A God-awful joke if it was one at all.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.331
I mean, you just embarrassed
yourself out there.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.199
You just said you pooped
outside in the yard.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.033
Comics?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.068
At work?

05:01.101 --> 05:02.436
Come on, dude.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.237
Ah no, I go and read them
in the bathroom, you know?

05:04.271 --> 05:05.739
It's like a really cool story

05:05.773 --> 05:09.543
and it's like a break
from all the paperwork.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.178
They make me happy.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.184
Oh, you have an interview.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.051
When?

05:23.491 --> 05:26.293
Your resume is, uh, something.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.895
You've had a lot of jobs.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.263
Yeah, I've been out there experimenting.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.131
Mm-hmm.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.134
Oh and, you don't have any references?

05:34.167 --> 05:36.069
No, I don't have any.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.471
Oh, actually, yeah I do.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.305
Here.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.139
Oh you have a refer...

05:39.172 --> 05:40.007
Okay.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.145
There we go.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.614
I guess that's Dale?

05:46.647 --> 05:47.448
Yeah.

05:47.481 --> 05:50.083
Presto, there's Dale.

05:50.117 --> 05:54.622
Uhm, so, as you know we
always need new employees here

05:54.655 --> 05:57.024
at Stanton Family Electronics.

05:57.057 --> 06:01.429
And, uhm, there is a
relatively high turnover rate.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.396
Like the pastry.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.931
I'm sorry? No.

06:03.964 --> 06:04.898
Turnover.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.434
No, I don't mean that.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.769
I mean like, uhm, there's
a lot of people that

06:08.802 --> 06:13.073
we hire and they have to
quickly move on to other things.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.174
Right.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.644
Who's going to be upset
about a surplus of pastries.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.978
No, I'm not talking about pastries.

06:18.011 --> 06:18.979
Yeah, I know.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.380
Okay, can we just move on.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.182
So, if you know how to answer a phone,

06:22.215 --> 06:23.951
follow a basic script,

06:23.984 --> 06:25.486
you can pretty much work here.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.319
Oh, I can do that.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.154
Great!

06:27.187 --> 06:27.988
When do I start?

06:28.021 --> 06:29.356
Oh, you can go ahead and sit down.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.793
Why don't we do a little
role-playing, first.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.395
See how you handle some of the things

06:35.429 --> 06:38.398
that might come up on a phone
call with a customer, okay?

06:38.432 --> 06:39.399
Let's give it a shot.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.300
Come on, I'm excited.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.169
So, here's my phone.

06:44.304 --> 06:47.541
Hello, my DVD player is not working.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.943
I wondered if you can help me.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.111
Ah, yes.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.981
Have you tried unplugging
it and plugging it back it?

06:54.014 --> 06:54.848
I already tried that.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.383
Oh, maybe you can go grab a hammer

06:56.416 --> 06:57.284
and start hitting it.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.218
Nope. Nope.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.453
We would never recommend that.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.088
No, I fix a lot of things
by hitting them with hammers.

07:01.121 --> 07:01.922
Do you really do that?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.591
How much is broken at your home?

07:03.624 --> 07:05.626
You know what, lets...

07:05.659 --> 07:06.660
- Let's try something else.
- Start over.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.528
Okay.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.566
Uhm, hello, I have a remote control

07:12.600 --> 07:16.003
that has a couple buttons
that are not working anymore.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.437
Do you have any advice?

07:17.471 --> 07:19.940
Take the batteries out,
and put 'em right back in.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.142
Great, one second.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.344
Take out the battery.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.847
Great, that's also not working.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.381
Well, I wouldn't suggest hitting it

07:28.415 --> 07:29.917
because we don't recommend
things like that.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.219
But if you could take it,
and then smack it against

07:32.252 --> 07:34.087
the coffee table or the couch leg...

07:34.121 --> 07:35.088
This is the same thing.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.189
That's still hitting it.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.190
Yeah, you don't...

07:37.224 --> 07:38.859
You hit the electronic
against something else.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.528
It's the way to fix things.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.595
It's an impact of some...

07:41.629 --> 07:42.563
It's a way to fix things.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.864
It's not the only way, of course.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.199
It's just a different
way of damaging them.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.937
I don't know what to do here.

07:49.970 --> 07:50.971
Uhm, well.

07:53.106 --> 07:56.309
Thank you so much for coming in.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.945
It was great to meet you.

07:57.978 --> 07:58.812
Tha... thank you.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.614
Clark, we'll uhm...

08:02.650 --> 08:05.152
I will do something with this.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.854
Oh hey, there you are.

11:26.887 --> 11:27.687
Hey.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.555
Where you been, buddy?

11:28.588 --> 11:29.356
Ah, sleeping.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.690
For four days?

11:30.724 --> 11:31.825
Four days?

11:31.859 --> 11:33.193
I guess you didn't have any time

11:33.226 --> 11:34.795
to check in or say hi or anything.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.496
But you had plenty of
time to make spaghetti.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.497
What spaghetti?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.132
You know, that enormous
bowl of spaghetti

11:39.166 --> 11:40.333
that's been there on the counter
all week.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.502
I assumed you were just making
them and then eating them

11:42.535 --> 11:44.171
and then immediately making another one.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.106
They've been steaming.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.107
Is it painful?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.742
Because I can prescribe
you something for pain.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.911
No, no it's not painful.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.579
Should it be?

11:52.612 --> 11:54.481
Well, is it one noodle?

11:54.514 --> 11:55.315
At a time?

11:55.348 --> 11:56.616
Like one long noodle?

11:56.649 --> 11:58.085
'Cause if it's one long noodle,
you know,

11:58.118 --> 11:59.953
that seems like it might not hurt.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.789
The size of your urethra
being comparable

12:01.822 --> 12:03.390
to the size of a spaghetti noodle.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.158
But is it possible that you inserted

12:05.192 --> 12:07.560
the spaghetti into your penis first?

12:07.594 --> 12:08.561
No.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.031
If it's a dry noodle,
a dry noodle can go in.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.533
I've put needles inside of urethras.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.367
Why?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.268
Science.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.336
To see if I could.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.170
Why do you go to the Moon?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.472
Did you just fall
asleep at a college party?

12:19.506 --> 12:20.373
Be honest.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.175
Did you buy a bunch of teenagers beer

12:22.209 --> 12:24.277
for a college party and then
fall asleep.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.846
And then you wiped off all the dicks

12:25.879 --> 12:27.180
they drew on your face
and then you showed up

12:27.214 --> 12:28.315
here at my office.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.917
And they put spaghetti
in your penis somehow.

12:29.950 --> 12:30.818
Do I like like a guy who...

12:30.851 --> 12:31.651
You do.

12:31.684 --> 12:32.685
It's not any of those things.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.021
It's just a, I'm just...

12:34.054 --> 12:35.155
Freaking out.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.589
Very well.

12:36.623 --> 12:37.657
Is it making you anxious?

12:37.690 --> 12:38.491
Yes.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.326
Okay!

12:39.359 --> 12:42.029
I will write you a prescription.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.971
There you are, sir.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.606
Weed.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.075
Really good weed.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.043
I don't need a weed.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.744
I need a fix.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.180
Did you not see my diploma?

13:01.048 --> 13:02.082
Oh.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.917
And there's myriad
ways in which marijuana

13:03.951 --> 13:05.185
might help your issue.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.019
Name one thing.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.587
Well, it might make you hungry.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.822
And then if you eat the spaghetti maybe

13:08.856 --> 13:10.323
it'll break a curse, I don't know.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.825
You would drink a spaghetti pee?

13:11.859 --> 13:13.126
No.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.462
But, I don't like spaghetti.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.197
Oh.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.439
Drink that spaghetti pee.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.316
Sorry, I'm getting a little anxious.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.051
This isn't happening.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.386
This isn't happening.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.088
This isn't happening.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.622
This isn't...

14:01.741 --> 14:04.844
Come on, that's my bag, please.

14:04.878 --> 14:05.778
Give me your bag.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.047
Give me your...

14:09.382 --> 14:11.084
Please, help my bag!

14:20.027 --> 14:21.728
What the hell?

14:21.761 --> 14:23.463
What the hell?

14:23.496 --> 14:24.364
What the hell?

14:24.397 --> 14:26.099
No no, don't do that.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.100
No, I'm sorry.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.535
I'm sorry, sorry.

14:52.792 --> 14:53.626
Freeze.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.864
Get off my plane.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.067
I ain't heard no fat lady.

15:02.635 --> 15:03.770
What the hell?

15:03.803 --> 15:04.704
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.273
Is that spaghetti?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.540
What's going on, Clark?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.142
Look, okay.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.078
This is going to seem weird.

15:11.111 --> 15:14.114
I can sling spaghetti from my hands.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.450
Yeah, okay.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.585
Look at the couch.

15:18.618 --> 15:19.852
You mean this?

15:19.886 --> 15:21.421
This pile of spaghetti
you had in your hand

15:21.454 --> 15:22.689
and then threw at me?

15:22.722 --> 15:24.091
That came from inside of me.

15:24.124 --> 15:27.627
This is, by far, your lamest prank ever.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.430
We gotta take you to a
doctor or an ER or something.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.264
Yeah?

15:31.298 --> 15:32.232
And tell 'em what, exactly?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.366
I don't know, but...

15:33.400 --> 15:34.968
Yeah, assuming that
they don't lock me up

15:35.002 --> 15:36.036
and throw me in a straight jacket,

15:36.069 --> 15:37.604
what do you thinks gonna
happen when they find out

15:37.637 --> 15:39.339
I can shoot spaghetti out of my hands.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.907
Being a real life mutant's
not gonna work out

15:40.940 --> 15:42.342
for me as well as you'd think.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.243
Yeah, you're right.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.777
I mean, look how it went for the X-Men.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.880
But this is weird man,
we've gotta do something.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.382
Yeah, no shit it's weird.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.483
Does it hurt?

15:50.517 --> 15:51.951
No.

15:51.985 --> 15:52.919
Do you feel different?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.321
No.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.356
What if you, like, told
a scientist or something?

15:56.389 --> 15:57.624
What'd I just say, Dale?

15:57.657 --> 15:58.858
I don't wanna tell anybody about this.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.293
This could be used for good, maybe.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.394
Like it could be a gift.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.230
You know, now I regret
saying anything to you.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.664
No no no.

16:04.697 --> 16:05.865
No, I'm sorry.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.930
Give us your money, asshole.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.107
Give me your wallet.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.142
I don't... please, stop it.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.443
Okay, Clark.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.944
Do not engage criminals.

16:51.978 --> 16:52.912
You're gonna stand up.

16:52.945 --> 16:53.980
And you're gonna run out of here.

16:54.013 --> 16:54.947
And you're gonna go home.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.716
Okay, and stand up...

17:04.090 --> 17:05.692
Listen, assholes.

17:05.724 --> 17:07.794
You leave that guy alone.

17:09.561 --> 17:10.896
Who the hell are you?

17:10.930 --> 17:12.932
I'm. I'm uh...

17:13.800 --> 17:16.136
Just walk away now, or else.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.005
Or else what?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.507
You know what?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.040
This isn't really working out

17:22.075 --> 17:23.210
the way I thought it was going to.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.345
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna go.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.012
Yeah, walk away, bitch.

17:27.046 --> 17:27.847
Bitch.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.382
Ah. Ow.

17:43.763 --> 17:44.597
Ahhhhh!

17:46.733 --> 17:48.268
Who are you?

17:48.301 --> 17:51.571
I'm the Spaghettiman.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.440
Oww. That was bad ass.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.008
Thank you, thank you so much.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.610
Did you see all that
cool stuff I just did?

17:57.644 --> 18:00.012
I thought they were going to kill me.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.014
This isn't about you.

18:02.048 --> 18:05.118
This about the punching, the
headbutting, the kyah, kyah.

18:05.152 --> 18:08.188
I wish I could, I
wish I could repay you.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.722
You can.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.325
What?

18:12.359 --> 18:13.193
What's in your wallet?

18:13.226 --> 18:14.394
Wait, uhm, seriously?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.296
Yeah, I mean, you said you wanted

18:16.329 --> 18:17.397
to repay me, right?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.265
Oh, uhm.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.603
Uhm, uh, a couple 20s and...

18:26.105 --> 18:28.074
Thank you.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.076
Pleasure doing business with you.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.380
Thank you for saving my life.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.247
Dick.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.984
Dick with 42 dollars.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.289
Betts likes beets...

18:42.322 --> 18:44.424
Betts doesn't like beets.

18:45.658 --> 18:46.759
Mmkay, mmkay.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.464
What are you doing?

18:51.498 --> 18:54.401
What, what's that on your head?

18:54.434 --> 18:56.603
And why are you dancing?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.838
Because I just made $40.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.507
Kicking some ass.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.341
What?

19:01.374 --> 19:02.175
Yeah, dude.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.443
It was crazy.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.977
Alright, I was walking
down the street, right?

19:05.011 --> 19:06.446
And I hear this dude just getting

19:06.479 --> 19:08.014
the living daylights kicked out of him.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.517
So I'm all like, I think
this guy needs to be saved.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.619
Look, very bravely,
and without hesitation.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.455
I just wanna emphasize,
not a moment went by

19:15.488 --> 19:18.458
until I decided, this
guy needs to be saved.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.526
By me.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.395
So I look around, grab
this paper sack, right?

19:22.429 --> 19:24.163
Put it over my head, so of course,

19:24.197 --> 19:26.199
nobody can see my face.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.067
And then I just leapt into action.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.202
I just let 'em have it.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.804
Bam. Boom. Kick. Slice.

19:31.838 --> 19:32.972
Took 'em all out.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.508
Then, the dude paid me.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.576
So you saved him?

19:36.609 --> 19:37.710
Pssh, yeah. Yeah.

19:37.744 --> 19:38.945
And I got paid.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.112
What if...

19:40.146 --> 19:42.915
What if you use the
spaghetti thing for good?

19:42.949 --> 19:45.552
Uhh, I did.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.287
I got paid 40 dollars.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.255
That's pretty good.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.856
But that's not what a superhero does.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.725
A superhero does things because
it's the right thing to do.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.561
And because he's a nice guy.

19:54.594 --> 19:55.662
Whoa, whoa.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.596
Slow down.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.598
Who said anything
about being a superhero.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.866
Think about it!

19:59.899 --> 20:02.034
You could clean up the
streets and beat up bad guys

20:02.068 --> 20:03.436
and be a role-model.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.772
Yeah, yeah. Or, or...

20:05.805 --> 20:08.174
I can get paid to punch people.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.409
I think you're missing the point.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.277
No.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.444
Look, I hear what you're saying, Dale.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.712
And, I totally get it.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.013
But, I also don't give a shit.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.382
I'm gonna do me, right?

20:15.415 --> 20:16.583
I'ma get paid.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.684
Get my money.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.018
And pay that rent.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.420
Pay you back.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.789
Boom, everything's great, baby.

20:22.822 --> 20:23.656
Get on up!

20:32.732 --> 20:34.200
'Scuse me.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.069
Did you lock your keys in the car?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.008
Stop right there.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.848
Hey, hey, I bet this incline is

20:48.881 --> 20:50.149
pretty tough on the 'ol arms, huh?

20:50.182 --> 20:50.983
I'm sorry, what?

20:51.017 --> 20:51.951
Yeah, let me help you out.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.185
Whoa whoa, no no no, I'm doing...

20:53.219 --> 20:54.454
Whoa, where are you taking me?

20:54.487 --> 20:55.455
- Hey, hey.
- To a shortcut.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.056
Nn-nn-nn-no, what?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.426
It's okay, I'm taking you to a shortcut.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.193
Nn-no, I can't do stairs, man.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.029
Not with that attitude you can't.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.063
What's going on?

21:04.096 --> 21:05.398
Oh, hello, sir.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.500
This young lady tried
to break into your car.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.801
I stopped her.

21:08.835 --> 21:12.939
And then tied up her
hands with this spaghetti.

21:12.972 --> 21:13.906
Uh. Okay.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.210
Do not drop me.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.379
I just want you to sit back, relax,

21:19.412 --> 21:21.247
keep your hands inside
the chair at all times,

21:21.280 --> 21:22.415
and we'll get you up there.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.684
Stairs aren't for
people in wheelchairs man.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.853
Sounds like an excuse
for segregation to me.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.287
No no, don't use that word.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.356
Who the hell are you?

21:29.389 --> 21:30.590
The question is,

21:30.623 --> 21:33.726
how much is this woman
willing to cough up

21:33.760 --> 21:35.595
in order to not get kidnapped.

21:35.628 --> 21:36.429
What?

21:36.463 --> 21:37.630
What?

21:37.664 --> 21:40.367
Yeah, I can let this
whole thing just continue.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.836
Or, you can pay me, mmm,
a hundred bucks.

21:43.870 --> 21:44.704
I...

21:46.105 --> 21:46.906
Have sixty?

21:46.939 --> 21:48.675
That'll do.

21:58.184 --> 21:59.886
You're gonna tell all
your friends about this.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.020
No, I'm going to tell
all my friends about

22:01.053 --> 22:02.422
how I met a lunatic.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.691
No, you're gonna
tell them how you met a hero!

22:04.724 --> 22:05.525
A hero?

22:05.558 --> 22:06.359
You're not a hero.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.259
Soldiers are heroes.

22:07.293 --> 22:08.461
Superman is a hero.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.662
You're an asshole.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.930
I'm all of those things.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.298
I can let her go right now.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.232
Yes.

22:13.265 --> 22:14.434
And then she'll probably go back

22:14.467 --> 22:16.335
to breaking into your car,
stealing it, driving it away.

22:16.369 --> 22:17.203
Or...

22:21.674 --> 22:22.909
Uh, I have...

22:24.411 --> 22:26.145
Seventeen bucks?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.815
That'll do, thank you.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.587
Oh, great, you're alive.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.824
How long was I out?

22:37.857 --> 22:40.059
Not long, 37 minutes or so.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.060
But, hey, don't worry.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.562
I very heroically watched over you,

22:42.595 --> 22:44.597
and not just because of
the money you owe me.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.032
But because it's the right thing to do.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.634
But...

22:47.667 --> 22:51.170
You can, uh, give me that $60,
so I can...

22:55.542 --> 22:57.143
I respect that.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.779
Okay, great.
Thank you so much.

22:59.812 --> 23:00.613
No problem.

23:00.647 --> 23:01.514
Thank you so much.

23:01.548 --> 23:02.348
I admit...

23:02.381 --> 23:03.315
No, don't.

23:03.349 --> 23:04.016
I admit, that took me a little bit

23:04.050 --> 23:05.117
longer than thought.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.586
It took a little bit
longer than you thought?

23:06.619 --> 23:07.820
You planned this?

23:07.854 --> 23:09.255
So I'm gonna cut you a deal.

23:09.288 --> 23:11.290
Half off what you were
originally gonna pay.

23:11.323 --> 23:12.124
What?

23:12.158 --> 23:12.959
I am not paying you shit.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.126
That's the deal!

23:14.160 --> 23:15.127
There's no deal.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.530
A deal has to exist if
someone wants something.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.364
I didn't want any of this.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.198
Okay.

23:19.231 --> 23:19.999
You ruined my day.

23:20.032 --> 23:20.833
Okay.

23:20.867 --> 23:21.668
You ruined my day.

23:21.701 --> 23:22.502
Okay.

23:22.535 --> 23:23.369
Bite me.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.671
Hah. How 'bout this.

23:24.704 --> 23:25.538
Dinner.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.412
I'll have an Eggs Benedict bar.

23:33.446 --> 23:35.047
That'll be a great weekend.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.249
Garibaldi's gonna love it.

23:38.317 --> 23:39.752
Oh, oh, hey Dale.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.955
I know you were Betts best man,

23:42.989 --> 23:44.924
but I was wondering if you
could also be my best man,

23:44.957 --> 23:48.461
'cause I like you
more than I like Betts.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.997
I like you more than I like
almost anyone.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.632
Oh boy oh boy oh boy.

23:52.665 --> 23:53.466
What a day.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.634
Good day.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.537
You should take your mask
off before you come home.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.437
Why?

23:58.471 --> 23:59.371
So villains don't know where you live?

23:59.405 --> 24:02.041
Villains?

24:02.074 --> 24:03.375
Supervillains?

24:03.409 --> 24:04.811
Hey, Batman had the Bat-cave.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.979
And Superman had
the Fortress of Solitude.

24:07.013 --> 24:09.215
Even Spider-man had a
backpack that he at least

24:09.248 --> 24:10.517
he put his costume into.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.184
Okay, okay.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.754
I'll start taking the
mask off three blocks

24:14.787 --> 24:17.189
down the street so that the villains

24:17.223 --> 24:20.292
don't follow me back to the Bat-cave.

24:23.863 --> 24:27.667
There's gotta be a better way
to do this.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.502
Walking around, looking for crimes.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.203
Trying to solve 'em.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.308
What's your problem?

24:36.342 --> 24:38.110
You know, I would love to
be out there helping people.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.078
But I can't.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.980
I'm stuck in a office.

24:41.013 --> 24:41.848
All day.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.619
I'm sorry, I'm not mad at you.

24:46.653 --> 24:47.554
I'm just...

24:49.689 --> 24:52.324
It was May of 1992 when the
cancer first struck my dad.

24:52.358 --> 24:53.159
Holy crap.

24:53.192 --> 24:53.993
Yeah, I know.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.728
I'm on TV.

24:55.762 --> 24:56.996
In a NewsChannel 4 exclusive,

24:57.029 --> 24:59.431
we finally have footage
of the masked vigilante

24:59.465 --> 25:00.867
that's been running around town,

25:00.900 --> 25:03.135
allegedly wearing a brown-paper bag.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.804
One of our viewers sent in this footage

25:04.837 --> 25:06.806
recorded from her mid-town apartment.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.942
She attempted to follow, but
lost him around the corner.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.044
Police recommend, do
not engage the subject

25:12.078 --> 25:13.846
and to call the crime-stoppers hotline

25:13.880 --> 25:15.815
below with any information.

25:15.848 --> 25:16.816
This is awesome.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.317
Maybe I'll be able to
drum up more business.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.352
People will be able to
get in contact with me.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.288
Don't give anyone your
address, or your name,

25:22.321 --> 25:23.222
or your phone number.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.591
You don't want that Clark.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.826
Please, if you listen
to one thing I say,

25:26.859 --> 25:27.927
listen to that.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.429
Uhhh, I'm not an idiot, Dale.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.131
I'm not gonna lead supervillains back

25:32.164 --> 25:35.501
to our Fortress of Solitude
where they can come get me.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.335
Good.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.203
Stupid.

25:40.406 --> 25:43.142
But a craigslist ad is anonymous.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.058
Dammit.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.292
Dammit.

26:00.326 --> 26:01.928
Dammit.

26:13.773 --> 26:17.043
Hey, whoa, this ad is killing it.

26:17.076 --> 26:17.877
Yeah?

26:17.910 --> 26:19.045
Yeah man, I got tons of messages.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.047
Here, help me figure out
what I should do.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.415
Wait, you didn't use your
own cell phone number in that,

26:23.449 --> 26:24.250
did you?

26:24.283 --> 26:25.084
No, Dale.

26:25.117 --> 26:25.918
I didn't.

26:25.952 --> 26:26.753
I'm not an idiot, okay?

26:26.786 --> 26:27.586
I watched The Wire.

26:27.620 --> 26:31.257
We use burners for things like this.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.291
"Dear Spaghettiman..."

26:32.324 --> 26:34.393
That's your official name?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.128
Yeah, pretty awesome, huh?

26:36.162 --> 26:37.830
Okay, "Dear Spaghettiman, me,

26:37.864 --> 26:39.598
some douchebag stole my television."

26:39.632 --> 26:41.801
"I know who it is, and
can get you his address."

26:41.834 --> 26:43.870
"I'll pay you $50."

26:43.903 --> 26:45.738
It sounds like someone's
just gonna pay your $50

26:45.772 --> 26:47.273
to steal someone else's television.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.107
Mm, don't care.

26:48.140 --> 26:48.941
Not enough money.

26:48.975 --> 26:49.776
Pass.

26:49.809 --> 26:50.609
Next email.

26:50.643 --> 26:51.610
"Dear Spaghettiman,

26:51.644 --> 26:53.145
My ex-wife won't give me my dog back."

26:53.179 --> 26:56.615
"It's very dear to me and I would
give you $100 to get it back."

26:56.649 --> 26:58.417
Yeah, that seems like
a tricky situation.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.688
'Cause even if you get the dog back,
she might sue you.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.389
And if you don't, he
might sue you for harm...

27:03.422 --> 27:06.392
Don't care, it's like 20
miles outside of town anyway.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.459
I'm not doing it.

27:07.493 --> 27:10.029
There's a lot of just,
small, weird ones in here.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.731
No one wants to pay any good money.

27:11.764 --> 27:12.732
Listen, I'm gonna go to work.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.366
To do police work.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.968
And do some real good in the city.

27:16.002 --> 27:18.037
Not because I'm paid to.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.806
But because I want to.

27:19.839 --> 27:22.274
And also because I'm paid to.

27:23.542 --> 27:24.877
Pass.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.312
Pass.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.747
Pass.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.148
Pass.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.649
Pa... wait a second.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.989
Please, uh, come in.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.524
Can I get you anything?

27:38.557 --> 27:39.625
Some soda, water...

27:39.658 --> 27:40.492
Coffee?

27:45.497 --> 27:47.800
Do you have any soup?

27:47.834 --> 27:48.667
Soup?

27:49.635 --> 27:52.304
Yeah, I'd like a soup.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.640
Alright, feed me some intel.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.708
Tell me about this guy.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.443
Uhm, his name is Gary.

27:57.476 --> 28:01.180
And, uhm, he's been
involved with these guys

28:01.213 --> 28:03.149
for a few months now.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.384
We were having some issues
in our relationship,

28:05.417 --> 28:07.286
and I guess...

28:07.319 --> 28:09.221
the drugs just made him feel better.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.823
Yeah, drugs are cool like that.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.491
So then he started to use harder stuff.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.593
And he couldn't pay for it.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.763
And now they're just keeping him there.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.230
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.299
Yeah, he's a sex-slave now.

28:20.332 --> 28:21.133
No!

28:21.167 --> 28:22.268
No, they...

28:22.301 --> 28:24.136
They're just asking for
ransom and I can't pay for it.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.237
Oh, uhm...

28:25.271 --> 28:27.139
That makes sense.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.007
Yeah.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.055
I got this.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.090
Are you sure?

28:44.123 --> 28:45.091
There's gonna be like a...

28:45.124 --> 28:47.994
like a bunch of guys there.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.728
Pfft, please.

28:49.762 --> 28:52.064
Stephanie, I am a superhero.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.233
Now, can I get this to go.

29:01.707 --> 29:05.044
Hey Terry, get the door.

29:13.719 --> 29:14.520
Criminals listen up.

29:14.553 --> 29:15.754
I'm here for Gary and I want...

29:15.788 --> 29:18.690
One, two, three, four, five, ssss...

29:20.092 --> 29:21.660
Okay, I messed up here.

29:21.693 --> 29:23.029
Okay, who the hell are you?

29:23.062 --> 29:25.431
I, uh, I'm the Spaghettiman?

29:25.464 --> 29:26.665
Oooh, cool.

29:26.698 --> 29:27.499
What?

29:27.533 --> 29:28.835
'Kay, I'm here for Gary and if...

29:28.868 --> 29:30.136
Hey guys, I'm Gary.

29:30.169 --> 29:32.704
Gary. Get back in there!

29:32.738 --> 29:34.941
If you guys know what's good for you.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.675
You'll cooperate.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.777
Now listen, do you got $1,500?

29:38.811 --> 29:40.746
No. I do not.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.148
Then you're not taking shit.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.149
Sir, you are mistaken.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.884
I came here for Gary and
I'm gonna take him back.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.653
Oh, well but, I'm afraid
you're mistaken, asshole.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.823
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my... what the?

30:14.813 --> 30:17.149
Ha ha ha. Blocked it, idiot.

30:23.522 --> 30:24.356
Hey?

30:24.390 --> 30:26.092
Hey, you okay?

30:26.125 --> 30:26.959
Hey, hey man?

30:26.993 --> 30:28.227
Hey dude?

30:28.260 --> 30:29.095
Hey?

30:29.128 --> 30:31.898
Oh my God, this guy's actually dead.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.121
Hey hey hey.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.890
Take another step and he gets it.

30:57.924 --> 30:58.824
Alright, I got it.

30:58.857 --> 30:59.825
I got it.

30:59.858 --> 31:00.826
Listen, I don't know
what the shit you are.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.428
But I swear to God, if you touch me,

31:02.461 --> 31:04.830
I'm gonna paint the wall
with his brains.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.664
Okay, you got it?

31:05.697 --> 31:06.832
I got it, I got it.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.167
Okay. Now get the hell out of my house.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.236
Unless you're gonna come back
with some money and shit.

31:10.269 --> 31:13.172
Or, you can shut your ugly mouth.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.374
And eat a bowl of justice.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.045
What?

31:19.078 --> 31:19.878
Look, alright, no no no.

31:19.912 --> 31:20.712
You know what?

31:20.746 --> 31:21.547
Forget about it.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.681
Forget I even said it.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.450
I was coming up with a
catch-phrase on the fly and I...

31:24.483 --> 31:25.484
I messed it up.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.518
I didn't say it.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.120
Go back to one.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.056
Well get the hell out of my place then.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.323
You piece of shit.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.159
Hey, buddy, is that a leak in your roof?

31:33.192 --> 31:34.026
Daaamn.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.895
Hey, that wasn't bad, right?

31:36.929 --> 31:39.498
I mean I was looking
for a line and I just,

31:39.531 --> 31:41.067
came up off the top of my head.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.768
Oh, I'm sorry, Gary.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.239
Sorry my catch-phrase wasn't
good enough for you, Gary.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.608
I was here saving your life.

31:52.979 --> 31:56.048
Oh my God.

31:57.216 --> 31:58.050
Oh!

31:59.285 --> 32:00.752
Okay lovebirds, break it up.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.021
I hate to be that guy.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.223
But no more hugging until I get paid.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.357
Yeah, okay.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.094
You know, it was quite a bit harder

32:08.127 --> 32:09.595
than I thought it would be.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.163
I cannot thank you enough.

32:11.197 --> 32:14.266
Sure, you could
thank me a little more though.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.135
We had a deal.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.671
Fine, take your druggie boyfriend.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.637
Whoa, hey guy.

32:51.670 --> 32:52.638
You look a little young to be

32:52.671 --> 32:53.839
sleeping out here on the streets.

32:53.872 --> 32:55.874
I'm running away from home.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.243
Why would you do that?

32:57.276 --> 32:58.277
Because.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.979
Life's over.

33:01.013 --> 33:01.813
Oh, no.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.249
You're too young to say that.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.284
Nope, it's all over for me.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.652
This is the end.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.888
I'll probably die soon.

33:09.921 --> 33:10.722
With that attitude?

33:10.756 --> 33:12.724
Yeah, you probably will.

33:12.758 --> 33:15.794
But if you keep a positive
mindset, a hope in your heart,

33:15.827 --> 33:17.729
you're gonna make it someday.

33:17.763 --> 33:18.897
Leave me alone.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.699
You know what you need?

33:20.732 --> 33:21.900
A meal.

33:21.933 --> 33:26.338
A little yum-yum in your tum-tum
will keep your heart full.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.343
Thank you.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.287
My rent, sir.

33:42.888 --> 33:44.223
Did you see this?

33:44.256 --> 33:45.157
See what?

33:46.192 --> 33:47.959
Hey, that's me feeding
the homeless dude.

33:47.993 --> 33:49.461
Ho man, man this is awesome!

33:49.495 --> 33:51.297
What? Did you charge
him $10 or something?

33:51.330 --> 33:52.798
No, Dale.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.766
He was homeless and
doesn't have any money.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.034
It was charity.

33:56.068 --> 33:58.070
You know, superheroes are
nice people, you know.

33:58.104 --> 34:00.439
Yeah, you're something.

34:00.472 --> 34:01.507
You know, there's a lot of
pictures of you

34:01.540 --> 34:02.341
doing this stuff out there.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.842
And you gotta start being careful.

34:03.875 --> 34:04.643
Well, yeah?

34:04.676 --> 34:05.611
Careful of what?

34:05.644 --> 34:07.579
Doing so awesome and making
so much money?

34:07.613 --> 34:09.014
I don't think so, man.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.014
Okay, I gotta go.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.717
Gotta go run the police
obstacle-course today.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.485
Probably fail again.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.920
Well, with that attitude you're gonna.

34:14.953 --> 34:16.722
I just, can't get over that wall.

34:16.755 --> 34:19.391
Is that a metaphor for something?

34:19.425 --> 34:21.960
No, it's an actual wall
that you have to get over.

34:21.993 --> 34:22.893
Hey, you can do it.

34:22.928 --> 34:24.130
Look at me.

34:24.163 --> 34:27.065
Unemployed entrepreneur with
tons of potential a week ago.

34:27.099 --> 34:30.569
Now, up and coming superhero
entrepreneur this week.

34:30.601 --> 34:33.705
If I can get over that wall,
you can too.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.341
Thanks.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.872
You're okay.

35:06.905 --> 35:07.773
Oh, thank you.

35:07.806 --> 35:08.974
Thank you so much.

35:09.007 --> 35:10.242
Wow, thank you.

35:11.977 --> 35:12.944
Oh my God, you found her.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.813
Yeah, I found her, I'm a superhero.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.348
Yeah, here you go.

35:58.690 --> 36:01.227
We're at 10th and grand

36:01.260 --> 36:02.328
waiting for a...

36:02.361 --> 36:03.795
One-one-forty, copy, twenty minutes.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.498
Alright, copy that.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.700
Unit seven-six has now reported a...

36:08.734 --> 36:10.402
...'78 Subaru wagon was the car?

36:10.436 --> 36:11.737
That's correct.

36:11.770 --> 36:15.173
Four-one-five
in progress near Echo Park.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.343
I've official on a suspect dressed
in a red-hooded sweatshirt

36:17.376 --> 36:20.178
and a paper bag near
the south end of the lake.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.648
All available units approach
the scene with caution.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.883
That'll teach you to stick your nose

36:24.916 --> 36:27.819
up in other people's shit.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.955
Now you, Dad Pants.

36:29.988 --> 36:32.524
You're gonna give me
that wallet and phone.

36:32.558 --> 36:36.662
Or I'm gonna break you
down like a cardboard box.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.331
Oh, man...

36:39.365 --> 36:40.566
Hey, are you okay?

36:40.599 --> 36:42.100
You got any money?

36:43.068 --> 36:43.935
You don't have any money?

36:43.969 --> 36:44.870
Okay.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.137
How about check, do you have any checks?

36:52.110 --> 36:53.044
Hey, you, jackass.

36:53.078 --> 36:54.179
Get back here.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.547
You owe me money!

36:55.581 --> 36:56.415
You ha...

36:57.416 --> 36:58.250
You...

37:00.719 --> 37:01.553
Dammit.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.527
Who are you?

37:08.560 --> 37:10.128
I'm...

37:10.161 --> 37:11.162
Answer me!

37:11.196 --> 37:11.997
I'm...

37:12.030 --> 37:12.831
Tell me your name!

37:12.864 --> 37:13.665
I'm tryi...

37:13.699 --> 37:14.500
Excuses!

37:14.533 --> 37:16.201
Can I speak, please?

37:16.234 --> 37:17.569
Sorry.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.372
I'm Anthony Banner, I'm a journalist.

37:20.406 --> 37:21.940
Anthony Banner...

37:21.973 --> 37:23.275
Why do I know that name?

37:23.309 --> 37:24.776
Maybe you've seen it on the news?

37:24.810 --> 37:26.678
My name's all over your footage.

37:26.712 --> 37:27.513
Yeah.

37:27.546 --> 37:28.614
Yeah, that's where.

37:28.647 --> 37:29.981
Are you following me?

37:30.015 --> 37:31.049
You're a hot commodity.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.684
People'll pay a pretty
penny for footage of you.

37:32.718 --> 37:34.486
You make money off of me?

37:34.520 --> 37:36.254
Yeah, sort of.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.088
You son of a...

37:37.122 --> 37:37.956
No no no, please don't hurt me.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.358
Please, I'm just doing my job.

37:39.391 --> 37:40.526
I have a pregnant wife, okay?

37:40.559 --> 37:41.860
Just don't hurt me.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.395
You cost me money.

37:43.429 --> 37:47.333
Would, would coffee or
dinner make up for it?

37:49.901 --> 37:52.037
Wha, what's the matter, Dale?

37:52.070 --> 37:54.706
Ah, I just got this rejection letter.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.775
You and Garibaldi can go
ahead and make fun of me.

37:56.808 --> 37:57.743
Wha, no.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.478
We just raz you 'cause,

37:59.511 --> 38:01.480
'cause you're one of our best buddies.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.315
I'm not your best buddy.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.750
I'm a nobody.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.652
That's not true!

38:06.685 --> 38:08.754
You don't know, the paperwork
that you do...

38:08.787 --> 38:11.890
This police station would
be a mess without you.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.459
You're just saying that.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.626
No, I'm not.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.727
No I'm not.

38:15.761 --> 38:16.862
Look, look,

38:16.895 --> 38:19.465
you're the hero that this
police station needs.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.800
No, no, that's not true.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.669
You're the hero this whole town needs.

38:23.702 --> 38:26.872
That's the Spaghettiman, that's not me.

38:26.905 --> 38:27.739
Not yet.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.909
What does that mean?

38:33.712 --> 38:36.081
If you want this town to be safe,

38:36.114 --> 38:39.284
you have to set him on the right path.

38:43.154 --> 38:43.955
I can't.

38:46.191 --> 38:47.693
A real hero could.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.101
Thank you.

39:08.279 --> 39:09.114
So.

39:10.248 --> 39:13.018
How long have you been
fighting crime with spaghetti?

39:13.051 --> 39:14.886
Well, I wouldn't really

39:14.920 --> 39:17.823
call it fighting crime, necessarily.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.358
More like, earning a paycheck.

39:21.226 --> 39:22.994
Who's paying you?

39:23.028 --> 39:24.362
All the people I save.

39:24.396 --> 39:25.464
What do you mean?

39:25.497 --> 39:29.468
Well, I go out
looking for crimes to stop.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.436
And when I stop 'em,

39:30.469 --> 39:32.671
I demand payment from the people I save.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.040
Or, people reach out to me
on craigslist.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.743
Send me anonymous emails and I sort of

39:37.776 --> 39:41.112
pick and choose based on
the rate they offer.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.048
What if somebody hires you

39:43.081 --> 39:45.050
to hurt someone who's innocent?

39:45.083 --> 39:46.618
Well, I don't do it.

39:46.652 --> 39:47.686
How do you know?

39:47.719 --> 39:49.555
It's like a superhero thing, to know.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.723
So it's not an altruistic endeavor?

39:51.757 --> 39:53.459
No, and don't you judge me.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.561
Okay, it pays the bills.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.262
Hey, no judgment here.

39:57.295 --> 39:58.296
I get it.

39:58.329 --> 40:01.166
I don't like what I do,
but I gotta pay rent.

40:01.199 --> 40:02.768
Among other things.

40:05.270 --> 40:06.137
So what do you do?

40:06.171 --> 40:07.272
Follow me around?

40:07.305 --> 40:09.074
Make those videos and make money off me?

40:09.107 --> 40:09.908
Basically.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.242
I track down crashes and crimes,

40:11.276 --> 40:12.878
get footage of it,

40:12.911 --> 40:15.413
and I sell it to
newspapers and TV outlets.

40:15.447 --> 40:16.247
Is the money good?

40:16.281 --> 40:17.583
It's getting better.

40:17.616 --> 40:18.784
Let me guess.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.719
You want me to go out chasing crazier

40:20.752 --> 40:23.755
and scarier crimes and
acting real nice to people

40:23.789 --> 40:25.791
so your videos can do better.

40:25.824 --> 40:29.728
Frankly, I don't give
a shit what you do.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.230
It'd just be nice to have a
heads-up before you do it.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.965
Maybe a call or a text.

40:33.999 --> 40:34.833
Email.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.202
That way I have enough time,

40:37.235 --> 40:38.937
I can get setup and get
a better shot of it.

40:38.970 --> 40:39.838
Oh yeah?

40:39.871 --> 40:41.372
What do I get out of it?

40:41.406 --> 40:42.474
Let's split the money.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.743
Ooh, so I could make double the money?

40:44.776 --> 40:46.812
It's a win for the both of us.

40:46.845 --> 40:47.879
But if you have my number,

40:47.913 --> 40:49.881
what stops you from turning
it in to the police?

40:49.915 --> 40:54.285
Why would I cut out a
huge source of my income?

40:54.319 --> 40:58.123
Moved here to make movies,
ended up chasing ambulances,

40:58.156 --> 41:02.561
now a crazy son of a bitch
with a bag on his head.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.763
Wife's gonna love this.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.097
Yeah, well, it could be worse, you know.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.899
Bunch of ninjas could
break into your apartment,

41:07.933 --> 41:10.936
kidnap your pregnant wife
and slap her around a bit.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.907
Perspective, guy.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.676
I'm offering a little perspective.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.210
Jeeze, lighten up.

41:22.380 --> 41:25.884
Can I get a to-go box, please?

41:33.091 --> 41:34.425
Sup?

41:34.459 --> 41:35.694
Throw me one of those bad boys.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.228
No, this is the last one.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.630
Okay, I'll go for the fridge.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.599
Uh, I drank all those.

41:40.632 --> 41:41.466
Okay.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.636
Is something going on?

41:46.137 --> 41:48.840
Do you realize that you
could make a difference?

41:48.874 --> 41:51.376
That you could be a real hero?

41:52.443 --> 41:56.181
Change the city, and
make it a better place?

41:56.214 --> 42:00.185
And instead you parade
around like an asshole.

42:00.218 --> 42:03.021
And only do nice things for
people who give you money.

42:03.054 --> 42:05.123
Yeah, well, I'm still helping people.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.158
No, you're not.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.527
You're taking advantage of them.

42:09.561 --> 42:10.996
This shouldn't be about you.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.731
It should be about them.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.132
It should be about making them feel like

42:14.165 --> 42:15.967
someone in this city cares about 'em.

42:16.001 --> 42:17.636
And it should be about
making them understand

42:17.669 --> 42:19.671
that Good can beat Evil.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.741
Maybe I don't want that responsibility!

42:22.774 --> 42:25.476
You don't have a choice!

42:25.510 --> 42:28.379
I would kill to be able to do
what you do.

42:28.413 --> 42:29.815
Just for one day.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.118
But I can't.

42:33.151 --> 42:36.154
Yeah, well if I could
trade with you, what I have?

42:36.187 --> 42:38.023
I would in a second.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.157
Actually that's not true.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.592
I make a lot of money, I like what I do.

42:40.626 --> 42:41.459
Go to hell.

42:41.492 --> 42:44.395
I can't handle that pressure, okay?

42:44.429 --> 42:46.164
I can't keep a job.

42:46.197 --> 42:47.966
I can't keep a girlfriend.

42:47.999 --> 42:50.501
I can barely keep a friend in you.

42:50.535 --> 42:53.705
Taking care of an entire city.

42:53.739 --> 42:54.640
You insane?

42:56.608 --> 42:58.677
I'm scared man.

42:58.710 --> 43:01.613
I'm scared every second I'm out there.

43:01.647 --> 43:03.048
And the thought...

43:03.081 --> 43:05.316
That an entire city needs me?

43:05.350 --> 43:07.753
Frightens the hell out of me.

43:14.660 --> 43:16.161
You're a coward.

43:30.876 --> 43:32.243
Banner Group video services.

43:32.277 --> 43:33.378
Hey, it's the Spaghettiman.

43:33.411 --> 43:34.212
I got us a gig.

43:34.245 --> 43:36.514
Nice, what's the address?

43:55.566 --> 43:58.536
Hey buddy, how
do you like your new phone?

43:58.569 --> 43:59.470
Who the hell are you?

43:59.504 --> 44:00.438
You know,

44:00.471 --> 44:01.506
if you're gonna steal a phone
from a bar.

44:01.539 --> 44:03.074
You might want to turn off
automatic photo uploads

44:03.108 --> 44:05.510
before taking all those stupid selfies.

44:05.543 --> 44:07.578
Whatever man.

44:07.612 --> 44:09.180
Whatever.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.320
Stop touching me!

44:15.353 --> 44:18.957
Hah, you've been served... spaghetti!

44:18.990 --> 44:19.991
That is dumb.

44:20.025 --> 44:21.192
Really, ah it's,

44:21.226 --> 44:22.060
you know what?

44:22.093 --> 44:23.829
You didn't hear that.

44:31.202 --> 44:32.237
I delivered a pretty great line

44:32.270 --> 44:33.772
after I wrestled the phone
out of his hand.

44:33.805 --> 44:35.907
Nah, it wasn't that great.

44:35.941 --> 44:36.742
But I can cut it.

44:36.775 --> 44:37.809
Okay, cool

44:37.843 --> 44:38.643
did you get the shot?

44:38.676 --> 44:39.477
Yeah.

44:39.510 --> 44:40.511
Awesome, okay.

44:40.545 --> 44:41.880
So, let's go return this phone.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.281
And then you'll get his story,

44:43.314 --> 44:44.649
so it doesn't look like
I'm just some thug

44:44.682 --> 44:46.017
who jacked a phone.

44:46.051 --> 44:47.185
Sounds good.

44:47.218 --> 44:48.286
Alright, turn in the footage

44:48.319 --> 44:49.988
and then go collect our cash.

44:50.021 --> 44:50.856
Not yet.

44:51.923 --> 44:54.059
What do you mean?

44:54.092 --> 44:56.327
First we have to sell the video.

44:56.361 --> 44:58.129
Then I fill out an invoice.

44:58.163 --> 44:59.664
And then we get paid.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.032
In like, two to three weeks.

45:01.066 --> 45:03.134
Two to three weeks?

45:03.168 --> 45:05.070
Legally they have 45 days to do it.

45:05.103 --> 45:06.905
But most do it in two to three weeks.

45:06.938 --> 45:09.875
Two, forty-five... how
does anybody live like this?

45:09.908 --> 45:11.476
That's freelance for you, man.

45:11.509 --> 45:12.610
I mean, I'm still waiting to get paid

45:12.643 --> 45:13.979
for the first video I got of you.

45:14.012 --> 45:15.914
Horse-shit.

45:15.947 --> 45:17.048
But, we speed up the process

45:17.082 --> 45:18.784
if we hurry up and get it in the system.

45:18.817 --> 45:20.418
So, let's return the phone.

45:20.451 --> 45:23.521
And I'll swing by my place
and upload it really quick.

45:23.554 --> 45:24.589
Great. Great.

45:24.622 --> 45:26.925
So what's that speed it
up like, two, three days?

45:26.958 --> 45:29.160
Nah, it's still a couple weeks.

45:29.194 --> 45:31.096
Gah! Come on!

45:34.465 --> 45:36.968
I don't have it, I swear.

45:37.002 --> 45:37.803
You know that's not

45:37.836 --> 45:39.838
the right answer, Derek.

45:41.807 --> 45:44.575
I swear, I wouldn't lie to you.

45:45.676 --> 45:48.279
Oh, but, that's what you said last time.

45:48.313 --> 45:49.114
Wasn't it?

45:49.147 --> 45:51.349
And, you had it on you the whole time.

45:51.382 --> 45:52.683
But this time's different.

45:52.717 --> 45:53.819
I'm low on cash.

45:53.852 --> 45:57.789
My wife, her car crashed,
took us for all we've got.

45:57.823 --> 45:59.590
My kid, he's been sick.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.727
You just, you just gotta believe me.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.663
Buddy, why didn't you say something?

46:05.696 --> 46:06.998
I believe you.

46:07.032 --> 46:07.866
Really?

46:09.267 --> 46:11.803
I believe your son is gonna have to ask,

46:11.837 --> 46:13.671
"Why did daddy have to die?"

46:13.704 --> 46:17.876
"When if he just paid right
now he'd have been just fine."

46:26.017 --> 46:28.019
Oh, look at that, Derek.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.589
Oh no, this looks like a little bit more

46:31.622 --> 46:33.324
than what you owe me.

46:33.358 --> 46:34.860
It's all I have.

46:36.461 --> 46:38.930
It's all I'll take, Derek.

46:38.964 --> 46:43.134
You can consider the rest a
down payment on the next round.

46:49.707 --> 46:51.843
Tough, but fair.

46:51.877 --> 46:52.677
Who's there?

46:52.710 --> 46:54.745
Relax,

46:54.779 --> 46:57.182
I'm not here to bust your balls.

46:57.215 --> 46:58.783
I'm here to offer you a job.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.551
Yeah, I'm not interested.
Thanks.

47:00.585 --> 47:01.486
How many of your men

47:01.519 --> 47:04.890
have been taken down
by the Spaghettiman?

47:09.127 --> 47:10.428
What's it to ya?

47:10.461 --> 47:12.463
How'd you like to fix the situation.

47:12.497 --> 47:13.464
I'm listening.

47:13.498 --> 47:14.665
I might have a way to beat him,

47:14.699 --> 47:15.633
if you've got the men.

47:15.666 --> 47:16.935
Oh I've got the men.

47:16.968 --> 47:18.169
Then let's take him down.

47:18.203 --> 47:19.037
Who are you?

47:19.070 --> 47:19.837
All you need to know is I

47:19.871 --> 47:21.506
have the info to take him...

47:21.539 --> 47:23.574
Okay, now I see your face.

47:23.608 --> 47:25.043
Tell me what you know.

47:25.076 --> 47:26.978
I know the Spaghettiman.

47:27.012 --> 47:28.679
I know him, alright?

47:30.181 --> 47:33.919
I know what his hopes
and what his dreams are.

47:33.952 --> 47:37.355
And I know what makes him
tick more than anyone.

47:37.388 --> 47:39.524
And I know how to take him out.

47:39.557 --> 47:40.858
And what do you want?

47:40.892 --> 47:42.860
Why do you wanna take
down the Spaghettiman?

47:42.894 --> 47:43.728
Why?

47:44.595 --> 47:46.531
Because it's what this city

47:46.564 --> 47:47.398
needs.

48:07.285 --> 48:09.654
You know, it's not polite to stare.

48:09.687 --> 48:10.521
Sorry.

48:11.522 --> 48:12.723
It's just not everyday
my husband brings home

48:12.757 --> 48:15.493
a man in a paper sack who shoots...

48:15.526 --> 48:17.762
Spaghetti, from his hands?

48:17.795 --> 48:19.297
And asks for soup?

48:22.934 --> 48:24.936
Mm, good soup.

48:26.504 --> 48:28.139
Did you make it from scratch?

48:28.173 --> 48:29.540
No, does it taste like it is?

48:29.574 --> 48:30.675
No.

48:38.516 --> 48:40.185
You and Anthony working together?

48:40.218 --> 48:41.319
We just started.

48:41.352 --> 48:42.153
That's nice.

48:42.187 --> 48:43.021
Well, hopefully.

48:43.054 --> 48:44.455
He said he could make some good money.

48:44.489 --> 48:45.723
And uh,

48:45.756 --> 48:46.924
I could sure use it.

48:46.958 --> 48:48.493
You don't have a day job?

48:48.526 --> 48:50.428
You're not like a rich billionaire
who lost his parents.

48:50.461 --> 48:51.262
Or?

48:51.296 --> 48:53.398
No way, I wish.

48:54.499 --> 48:55.300
This is it.

48:55.333 --> 48:56.767
This is my income.

48:56.801 --> 48:58.536
Does anyone know who you really are?

48:58.569 --> 49:00.305
Yeah, I have this friend.

49:00.338 --> 49:03.374
Uhm, he's kinda weird about it though.

49:03.408 --> 49:04.942
Wants me to do good.

49:04.976 --> 49:07.712
Wants me to go out there
and be a superhero.

49:07.745 --> 49:08.579
For free.

49:10.348 --> 49:15.153
But I figure, I can go out,
do good, and collect money.

49:15.186 --> 49:16.321
Yeah.

49:16.354 --> 49:17.255
Uh, sure.

49:17.288 --> 49:19.557
I could see both sides.

49:19.590 --> 49:20.425
Eeeh.

49:20.458 --> 49:22.393
You ever get scared?

49:22.427 --> 49:24.662
Scared?

49:24.695 --> 49:26.697
Yeah like, in a fight?

49:29.200 --> 49:30.001
Yeah.

49:30.035 --> 49:31.469
But you still do it.

49:31.502 --> 49:32.570
I have to.

49:32.603 --> 49:34.772
So maybe that's what
makes you a hero, then?

49:34.805 --> 49:36.307
Nope, I just need the money.

49:36.341 --> 49:37.508
I hear that.

49:43.914 --> 49:46.184
How, uhm, how far along...

49:46.217 --> 49:47.018
Is that?

49:47.052 --> 49:48.453
Five months.

49:48.486 --> 49:49.387
Identical twins.

49:49.420 --> 49:50.521
Twins?

49:50.555 --> 49:52.557
Oh, that sucks.

49:52.590 --> 49:53.391
It doesn't suck.

49:53.424 --> 49:54.792
I mean, that doesn't suck.

49:54.825 --> 49:57.228
It's just,

49:57.262 --> 49:58.563
It's gonna be expensive.

49:58.596 --> 49:59.730
Way... very expensive.

49:59.764 --> 50:01.232
Yes. Very much.

50:01.266 --> 50:03.134
Luckily, uhm...

50:03.168 --> 50:05.636
I have insurance with
my job, so, you know.

50:05.670 --> 50:07.138
Not completely screwed.

50:07.172 --> 50:08.239
Well, Anthony said these videos

50:08.273 --> 50:09.374
are gonna make some good money.

50:09.407 --> 50:12.177
So, uh, let's hope we keep doing good.

50:12.210 --> 50:13.244
Let's just hope
Anthony doesn't get hurt.

50:13.278 --> 50:14.279
Okay?

50:14.312 --> 50:15.446
Come on.

50:15.480 --> 50:16.614
We'll be fine.

50:16.647 --> 50:18.583
I don't want my kids to
grow up without a father.

50:18.616 --> 50:19.584
I grew up with a father,

50:19.617 --> 50:21.786
and look how I turned out.

50:26.357 --> 50:27.725
Mm, can I sing a song to your kids?

50:27.758 --> 50:28.559

How's it going?

52:17.902 --> 52:19.370
Good.

52:19.404 --> 52:21.206
Almost done submitting this stuff.

52:21.239 --> 52:23.574
And I'm gonna take him home.

52:24.642 --> 52:26.043
Weird guy, huh?

52:26.076 --> 52:27.345
Mm.

52:27.378 --> 52:28.313
For a guy with a paper bag
over his head,

52:28.346 --> 52:30.080
he's not that weird.

52:34.385 --> 52:36.487
Is it safe, Tony?

52:36.521 --> 52:37.855
Yeah, totally.

52:39.524 --> 52:42.092
He's a psychopath with
a paper bag over his head.

52:42.126 --> 52:43.894
We don't know he's a psychopath.

52:43.928 --> 52:46.030
Yeah, but what if he is?

52:46.063 --> 52:48.966
Well, then, at least he likes me?

52:50.535 --> 52:52.403
I finished with the soup.

52:52.437 --> 52:54.705
You want me to put this on the counter?

52:54.739 --> 52:56.707
Uhm, actually, if you could rinse it out

52:56.741 --> 52:58.743
and put it in the
dishwasher, that'd be great.

52:58.776 --> 53:00.245
Oh, you have a dishwasher? Awesome.

53:00.278 --> 53:01.346
That is cool.

53:02.713 --> 53:04.815
How much longer are you guys gonna be?

53:04.849 --> 53:06.617
Twelve minutes?

53:06.651 --> 53:08.519
Can't he just walk home?

53:08.553 --> 53:09.554
Look, he asked me for a ride

53:09.587 --> 53:11.656
and I already said I'd take him, so...

53:11.689 --> 53:12.657
How far away does he live?

53:12.690 --> 53:14.191
I don't know.

53:14.225 --> 53:15.560
But you know, him being here

53:15.593 --> 53:17.161
is just as much your fault
as it is mine.

53:17.194 --> 53:18.263
How is that?

53:18.296 --> 53:19.830
You gave him soup.

53:19.864 --> 53:21.832
He said he was hungry.

53:21.866 --> 53:23.200
He asked for soup.

53:23.234 --> 53:25.035
You could've given him a sandwich.

53:25.069 --> 53:26.203
Soup means stay.

53:26.237 --> 53:28.806
Sandwich is, portable.

53:28.839 --> 53:31.141
Hey, can I borrow this Sideways DVD?

53:31.175 --> 53:33.644
Uh, yeah.

53:33.678 --> 53:35.780
I've been wanting to get into wine.

53:35.813 --> 53:39.149
This is an awesome way to get into wine.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.988
Is the money good?

53:45.022 --> 53:46.791
Footage of him gets me twice as much

53:46.824 --> 53:48.726
as what I normally get.

53:52.297 --> 53:53.130
Okay.

53:54.399 --> 53:58.536
I say we do this until
these guys pop out of here.

53:58.569 --> 54:01.005
When they're out, you're out.

54:03.608 --> 54:05.276
Sounds good to me.

54:07.378 --> 54:08.613
Just don't get yourself killed.

54:08.646 --> 54:09.480
Please.

54:11.048 --> 54:13.150
Kat, I'm gonna be fine.

54:14.819 --> 54:16.321
I shoot from so far away, most the time

54:16.354 --> 54:18.255
I'm out of the equation anyway.

54:18.289 --> 54:20.491
Yeah, except when he's at our house.

54:20.525 --> 54:21.692
Dishwasher's broken.

54:21.726 --> 54:22.527
I'm gonna go.

54:22.560 --> 54:23.361
I'll walk home, don't worry.

54:23.394 --> 54:24.228
Thank you.

54:28.132 --> 54:28.933
These are the best

54:28.966 --> 54:30.968
and brightest guys I have, boss.

54:31.001 --> 54:32.437
They better be.

54:35.105 --> 54:37.708
Alright, uh, let's get started.

54:37.742 --> 54:38.543
Hi.

54:38.576 --> 54:39.377
Name.

54:39.410 --> 54:40.911
My name's Amir, I'm a CPA.

54:40.945 --> 54:42.212
My name is Dwayne.

54:42.246 --> 54:43.047
Call me Dean.

54:43.080 --> 54:43.948
Uh, Gabriel.

54:43.981 --> 54:45.215
Name is Nightbandit.

54:45.249 --> 54:46.083
Occupation.

54:46.116 --> 54:47.885
I'm a bandit.

54:47.918 --> 54:49.954
Who works at night.

54:49.987 --> 54:51.756
Well, I'm an ex-special forces.

54:51.789 --> 54:54.725
But, uh, by day I'm a metro bus-driver.

54:54.759 --> 54:56.761
I'm an unemployed hi-hop artist by day.

54:56.794 --> 54:58.896
But, like a random odds
and ends guy at night.

54:58.929 --> 55:03.067
I'm a volunteer at a-a-a,
animal shelter for cats.

55:04.969 --> 55:06.471
I lay bricks.

55:06.504 --> 55:08.072
What's your criminal history?

55:08.105 --> 55:09.707
Well once I left the special forces,

55:09.740 --> 55:14.412
I, uh, did my time as an
ax-murderer for a little while.

55:14.445 --> 55:17.848
Larsony, arsony, uh, grand theft hydro.

55:17.882 --> 55:19.450
Well, I stole a pack
of gum in second grade.

55:19.484 --> 55:21.752
Uhm, haven't gotten caught yet.

55:21.786 --> 55:25.523
Let's just say... I've
laid a lot of bricks.

55:25.556 --> 55:27.324
Show me some moves.

55:42.773 --> 55:43.674
You get 'em with the roll.

55:43.708 --> 55:44.509
Spin around.

55:44.542 --> 55:45.376
Throat.

55:52.116 --> 55:52.983
Yeah, so there's that, you know.

55:53.017 --> 55:54.519
And it's for fights, yeah.

55:54.552 --> 55:56.721
This is your wallet.

55:56.754 --> 55:57.655
I stole it.

55:59.289 --> 56:01.191
'Cause I'm a night bandit.

56:01.225 --> 56:02.627
I wanna do a little role-playing.

56:02.660 --> 56:04.228
Spaghettiman comes up from behind you.

56:04.261 --> 56:05.496
What do you do?

56:06.330 --> 56:08.198
I grab his hand.

56:08.232 --> 56:09.266
Put him down.

56:09.299 --> 56:13.003
And immediately I put my
knee, my knee on his neck.

56:13.037 --> 56:15.940
And then I neutralize the
situation and back off.

56:15.973 --> 56:18.743
Well, I just uh, turn back on a dime

56:18.776 --> 56:21.111
and punch him right in
the mouth with a fist.

56:21.145 --> 56:23.414
Well, let's say he's
coming from the front.

56:23.448 --> 56:25.583
Grab him by the waist.

56:25.616 --> 56:27.184
Take out his center of gravity.

56:27.217 --> 56:30.320
I pull my head in, so my
neck isn't susceptible.

56:30.354 --> 56:32.890
Grab his elbow, put him
down, knee on the neck.

56:32.923 --> 56:35.626
Grab the arm, neutralize the situation.

56:35.660 --> 56:36.527
By then I should already have

56:36.561 --> 56:38.496
a protective brick wall behind me.

56:38.529 --> 56:39.597
I turn around.

56:39.630 --> 56:40.865
Reach in between his legs.

56:40.898 --> 56:42.299
And rip his dick off.

56:42.332 --> 56:44.569
Just like my grandmother taught me.

56:44.602 --> 56:45.970
Restart.
This time I attack him.

56:46.003 --> 56:47.204
He's grabbed my arm.

56:47.237 --> 56:48.706
Right?

56:48.739 --> 56:49.707
He puts me down.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.676
His knee is on my neck.

56:52.543 --> 56:54.211
And he won that one.

56:55.880 --> 56:56.947
So, what d'you think boss?

56:56.981 --> 57:00.217
I think I chose the wrong
man to lead this fight.

57:00.250 --> 57:01.586
'Scuse me?

57:01.619 --> 57:03.020
You brought me a bunch of morons.

57:03.053 --> 57:06.056
Spaghettiman has taken out
all the best guys I know.

57:06.090 --> 57:07.357
This is what we have left.

57:07.391 --> 57:09.594
If this is the best you
have, then we're going to lose.

57:09.627 --> 57:10.795
Listen, fighting on the streets

57:10.828 --> 57:12.763
is not like your normal job.

57:12.797 --> 57:14.264
You can't interview for it.

57:14.298 --> 57:16.000
I told you that.

57:16.033 --> 57:18.202
These guys think differently from you.

57:18.235 --> 57:19.804
Their brains are wired differently.

57:19.837 --> 57:21.972
They're going to react
when punches are coming

57:22.006 --> 57:24.509
at their faces, not questions.

57:25.943 --> 57:28.646
Then we're gonna need more.

57:28.679 --> 57:29.980
More?

57:30.014 --> 57:31.682
Yeah, go get more.

57:32.783 --> 57:34.519
I've something to do.

57:54.338 --> 57:55.172
Hello?

57:56.440 --> 57:57.307
Why didn't you call me?

57:57.341 --> 57:58.175
About what?

57:58.208 --> 57:59.343
Your gig last night?

57:59.376 --> 58:01.011
I didn't have a gig last night.

58:01.045 --> 58:02.847
You didn't?

58:02.880 --> 58:04.949
No, and if I did I would've called you.

58:04.982 --> 58:06.016
It's all over the news today.

58:06.050 --> 58:07.384
A guy was found beaten downtown,

58:07.417 --> 58:08.385
his wallet was stolen,

58:08.418 --> 58:10.220
he had spaghetti stuck
on his face and arms.

58:10.254 --> 58:11.689
Sound familiar?

58:11.722 --> 58:12.523
Wait, what?

58:12.557 --> 58:13.357
What guy?

58:13.390 --> 58:14.559
I don't know, you tell me.

58:14.592 --> 58:16.426
Sounds to me like you were
doing shit downtown last night.

58:16.460 --> 58:17.427
You think it was a copycat?

58:17.461 --> 58:18.763
I don't know.

58:18.796 --> 58:20.565
I'll keep my ears open.

58:20.598 --> 58:22.567
See if I hear anything on the scanner.

58:22.600 --> 58:23.868
If I do, I'll let you know.

58:23.901 --> 58:25.302
Okay. Thanks.

58:25.335 --> 58:27.471
In the meantime, if you do go out again.

58:27.504 --> 58:29.206
Will you please call me first?

58:29.239 --> 58:31.809
It's not just a huge chunk
of money for the both of us.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.443
It's also an alibi.

58:33.477 --> 58:35.646
I will, lay off me, mom.

58:41.752 --> 58:42.820
Hey.

58:42.853 --> 58:46.056
You see this thing about
the dude getting beat up?

58:46.090 --> 58:47.157
No.

58:47.191 --> 58:49.126
Yeah man some guy
got beat up in the park.

58:49.159 --> 58:50.194
Spaghetti all over him.

58:50.227 --> 58:51.228
Cops think it was me.

58:51.261 --> 58:52.062
Was it?

58:52.096 --> 58:53.230
No.

58:53.263 --> 58:54.098
Hmm.

58:59.369 --> 59:00.537
What, you don't believe me?

59:00.571 --> 59:01.672
No, I believe you.

59:01.706 --> 59:02.707
Then what's the problem?

59:02.740 --> 59:03.674
Got work.

59:24.528 --> 59:26.230
Hey, where are you?

59:26.263 --> 59:27.732
I'm here.

59:27.765 --> 59:29.900
Okay, well, hurry up.

59:29.934 --> 59:32.502
I'm gonna check this place out.

59:36.106 --> 59:36.941
Hello?

59:38.008 --> 59:38.843
Hello?

59:39.777 --> 59:41.278
Spaghettiman here.

59:44.414 --> 59:46.817
Oh my God, oh my God.

59:46.851 --> 59:47.652
Hey buddy.

59:47.685 --> 59:49.086
Hey, hey, what happened to you man?

59:49.119 --> 59:49.920
Oh hey.

59:49.954 --> 59:51.121
Hello.

59:51.155 --> 59:52.256
Jesus, you cannot
sneak up on a guy like that.

59:52.289 --> 59:53.624
I'm tryin' to...

59:58.062 --> 01:00:00.631
The hell is going on here?

01:00:00.665 --> 01:00:01.465
How you doing, bud?

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:02.299
You with us?

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:03.267
Wha, what happened?

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.569
Nothing man, you're okay.

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:07.772
Wait, who you calling?

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:10.274
Hey, who's he calling?

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:14.478
Hello? I'd like to report
a crime in Grant Park.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.883
Now, I just need you
to speak into this phone

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:21.285
and tell them Spaghettiman did it.

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:22.653
You can do that, right?

01:00:22.687 --> 01:00:23.921
Ah you guys are tryin' to set me up.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:25.289
You're tryin' to pin this on me.

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:26.991
Yeah, well it ain't happenin' buddy.

01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:28.959
This guy owes me, he ain't saying shit.

01:00:28.993 --> 01:00:29.994
It was Spaghettiman.

01:00:30.027 --> 01:00:31.228
Dude, come on, really?

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:32.262
Sorry man.

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:01.992
Get in the car!

01:01:02.026 --> 01:01:02.827
Get in the car!

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.294
What? What's going on?

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.229
They shot the hobo.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:06.063
Is he dead?

01:01:06.096 --> 01:01:07.231
Super dead, come on.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:08.532
Get in, get in.

01:01:19.844 --> 01:01:20.644
What the hell just happened?

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.646
They shot him, man.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:23.714
The hobo.

01:01:23.748 --> 01:01:25.049
They beat him and then
they shot him in the head.

01:01:25.082 --> 01:01:26.150
Jesus Christ.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:27.351
Yeah.

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:28.185
Sucks for him.

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:29.286
But what about me?

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:31.121
I had to see his brains
leak out all over the place.

01:01:31.155 --> 01:01:32.356
Do you know who they were?

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:33.490
No clue.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:34.959
But they're gonna think it was me.

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:36.994
He was on the phone and he
said, "Spaghettiman did it."

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:39.163
Someone's going through this
much trouble to set you up...

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:41.398
You must've really pissed somebody off.

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.500
Yeah, but who?

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:39.189
Blood was coming out of his ears

01:02:39.223 --> 01:02:40.958
and brains were coming out of his eyes.

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:42.392
Are you sure he's dead?

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:43.727
Maybe we can go back and...

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.796
I mean, he might still be alive.

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:46.630
You can't be alive

01:02:46.663 --> 01:02:49.333
with brains coming out of your eyes.

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:51.168
What the hell happened in here?

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:52.436
Dale, are you okay?

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:53.437
Clark, is that you?

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.672
Don't say my real name.

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.241
You just said mine!

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:59.209
You're a nobody.
I'm the Spaghettiman.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:00.177
Should I call 911?

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.011
Who's that?

01:03:01.045 --> 01:03:01.846
No.

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:02.679
Don't call 911.

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:03.680
This is Anthony.

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:04.982
He's been putting up all
those cool videos of me.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.516
You're working with this guy?

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:07.584
Ah, they destroyed the shelf

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.286
and the desk is all messed up.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:13.523
And this plate! Aw, they
messed up your favorite plate!

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:15.025
Something's going on.

01:03:15.059 --> 01:03:16.593
Yeah something's going on.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:17.727
And it's your fault.

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:19.329
How the hell do you
figure this is my fault?

01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:20.831
It's your stupid videos.

01:03:20.865 --> 01:03:22.699
They put my paper bag
face all over the place.

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:24.701
People know I exist and they're pissed.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.103
Even if there weren't any videos,

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:27.838
you're still taking
criminals off the streets.

01:03:27.872 --> 01:03:30.407
Criminals with connections
to other criminals.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.443
Get out of my house.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:34.811
Fine.

01:03:34.845 --> 01:03:38.248
And don't you dare call me.

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:41.886
You're the one calling
me all the time, asshole.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:45.389
Yeah, well, I won't anymore.

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:46.223
I'm so sorry.

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:47.958
I don't know how they found me.

01:03:47.992 --> 01:03:50.360
You've gotta go get 'em, Clark.

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:52.296
You've gotta get 'em.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:53.130
No.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:53.964
No way man.

01:03:53.998 --> 01:03:54.798
I'm done.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:55.632
What, do I have to pay you?

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:57.267
No, it's way too dangerous.

01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:59.203
I saw a hobo get shot in the head.

01:03:59.236 --> 01:04:00.570
People are trying to frame me.

01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:02.006
And now all this?

01:04:02.039 --> 01:04:03.307
I can't take this anymore.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.141
But what about me?

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.309
What about you?

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:06.676
You think finding the people
that did this

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:08.178
is going to make any difference?

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:09.113
Word's gonna get out.

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:10.614
They're gonna send those people
back here

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:12.182
to finish the job.

01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:13.050
No way man!

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.618
I'm done.

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:16.887
I'm gonna get you some ice.

01:04:26.663 --> 01:04:28.365
Got some ice!

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:32.802
Easy does it.

01:04:32.836 --> 01:04:34.571
Put you right here.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:35.605
And alright.

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:45.049
Uh huh, it's your favorite.

01:04:59.596 --> 01:05:01.665
There, get you some milk.

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:04.734
Woo!

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:05.602
Good.

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:14.478
Ah!

01:05:17.982 --> 01:05:18.815
I'm sorry.

01:05:20.817 --> 01:05:22.419
There you go.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:23.453
Thank you.

01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:33.163
Oh that's good, huh?

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.334
Yeah, I told you.

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:38.535
Peter Gallagher's really good
in The O.C.

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:40.670
Okay, let me experience it on my own.

01:05:40.704 --> 01:05:43.440
Just, you think like, there's
no way he's gonna be good.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.175
And he's like, great.

01:05:45.209 --> 01:05:47.477
And that makes it amazing.

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:50.914
And those, I mean, those eyebrows man.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.482
Jesus, they pierce right through you.

01:05:52.516 --> 01:05:53.717
You won't stop talking about 'em.

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:57.154
I just want him to be my dad, you know?

01:05:59.256 --> 01:06:00.757
Let me get that.

01:06:01.858 --> 01:06:03.160
Thank you.

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:04.961
Sit back and relax.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.232
Ah, thanks man.

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:13.137
Oh, this is where Ryan...

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:15.072
Which one's Ryan?

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:16.373
He's the main guy.

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:17.507
He talks about how he's brooding

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:18.908
and it's like really meta.

01:06:18.942 --> 01:06:20.244
He's, this character is aware of,

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:22.412
that he is this character.

01:06:22.446 --> 01:06:23.247
Who's Mischa Barton?

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.081
Huh?

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:24.948
Shouldn't you be out there,

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.216
finding the guys who did this to me?

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:27.651
Shhh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:29.586
You need your strength.

01:06:42.066 --> 01:06:43.700
Clark, I can bathe myself.

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.202
Don't worry, I got it.

01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:47.504
No man, I'm feeling a whole lot better.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:49.906
And I really don't need you
to be in here.

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:50.907
Hey.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.576
Don't be too proud to
ask for a little help.

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:54.278
You know what'd help?

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:56.646
If you went out and fought
the guys who did this to me.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.547
Holy cow.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:07:00.750
Did you know you have a mole back here?

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:09.293
Hey, are you going out?

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:10.127
Yeah.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:10.960
To destroy this.

01:07:10.994 --> 01:07:12.096
You can't!

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:12.996
What's your deal, Dale?

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.898
I've done nothing but help you out

01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:16.466
over the last few days.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.302
It's my fault that this
whole place got destroyed.

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:20.470
It's my fault that you got beat up.

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:22.306
And it's all because of this.

01:07:22.339 --> 01:07:23.940
So I'm doin' my best to make it right.

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.210
You can make up for it
by getting back out there.

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:27.344
You hated what I did!

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:28.345
I did.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:30.280
But don't you feel some
sense of responsibility?

01:07:30.314 --> 01:07:31.548
An actual calling?

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:32.416
Nah.

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:46.163
It's time for Plan B.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.274
What do you want?

01:08:34.278 --> 01:08:35.279
Where is it?

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:43.051
Do you know the number?

01:08:43.086 --> 01:08:45.020
No, I don't know the damn number!

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:46.223
How did they connect us?

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:48.258
I don't know.

01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:49.225
Did you tell anyone you work with?

01:08:49.259 --> 01:08:50.460
No.

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:51.661
Maybe they followed us
and the saw us together.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:52.629
I doubt it.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:53.630
Dale's a cop.

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.765
Maybe he can just go in and...

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:57.234
Wait.

01:08:57.267 --> 01:08:58.568
You don't think...

01:08:58.602 --> 01:08:59.703
It can't...

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:02.339
He's the only one who knows
you and I work together.

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:03.340
It can't be.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:04.308
Call him!

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.149
Hey man, what's up?

01:09:14.184 --> 01:09:16.118
Oh, thank God.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.854
What?

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:20.224
Just uh, to hear that you answered

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.691
and everything's fine.

01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:24.160
Oh, uh, totally.

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:25.261
Cool, cool.

01:09:25.295 --> 01:09:26.430
So I'll see you later then?

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.265
Oh hey, real quick.

01:09:28.298 --> 01:09:30.500
Does Anthony wanna
hear his wife's voice?

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.903
She's a really terrible
crier, it's so annoying.

01:09:33.937 --> 01:09:36.139
Hey, Keto, take care of that.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:38.707
You son of a bitch!

01:09:38.742 --> 01:09:39.776
I'll kill the bastard.

01:09:39.809 --> 01:09:40.609
No no no no.

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:41.444
What?

01:09:41.478 --> 01:09:42.546
Where are we going?

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:43.880
I don't know.

01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:53.390
Ch'ello?

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:54.491
Where are we going?

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.460
Oh, that'd be good to know, huh?

01:09:56.493 --> 01:10:00.230
Yeah, that'd be good to know, Dale.

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:02.866
Where's Dean?

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:03.967
You didn't hear man?

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.702
Got crushed by his own brick wall.

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:07.237
That sucks.

01:10:07.271 --> 01:10:10.407
Hey uhm, how much you guys wanna bet

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.609
I'll be the one that
takes Spaghettiman down.

01:10:12.642 --> 01:10:13.443
Incorrect.

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:15.111
That'll be me.

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.346
You wanna bet 50 on that?

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.614
Oh yeah.

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:19.316
I think I'll be the one
to take Spaghettiman out.

01:10:19.349 --> 01:10:20.884
Yeah, what makes you think that?

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:22.252
Simple.

01:10:22.286 --> 01:10:23.687
Chop to the neck.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.790
Don't you think if
anyone could've done that,

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:29.493
he would've done that already.

01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:30.327
I chop.

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:33.430
And then I kick.

01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:36.366
Yeah, I think all
you guys are gonna die.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.101
Nah, nah guys, it's simple, alright?

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:39.703
You walk up to him.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:40.904
You grab his dick.

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:42.606
You rip it off.

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:44.441
Uh, if you can get that close.

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:46.743
I'll get so close to his
dick that I can smell it.

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:48.678
Then I'll rip it off.

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:49.913
It'll be easy.

01:10:49.946 --> 01:10:51.615
Sweep the leg.

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:54.451
Punch him so hard in the nose,
the nose goes into his brain.

01:10:54.484 --> 01:10:57.287
And, if I'm allowed,
I'll take the skull home.

01:10:57.321 --> 01:10:59.155
Use it as a cereal bowl.

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:01.190
I've done the nose
trick to a lot of guys.

01:11:01.224 --> 01:11:02.158
It works really well.

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:02.959
Oh yeah?

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:03.827
How many.

01:11:05.429 --> 01:11:07.397
I don't have to prove anything to you.

01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:08.865
Shut up.

01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:12.702
You guys realize it won't
be this easy, right?

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:17.641
If, and when you guys
fail, I will beat him.

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:20.810
One way.

01:11:24.548 --> 01:11:25.915
The straight vertical fist to the face

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:27.283
with the step-in elbow to follow it up.

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:29.519
He's gonna expect another
straight strike

01:11:29.553 --> 01:11:30.854
so I step off on the angle,

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:32.088
spinning elbow.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.857
Now I come back, around on the angle.

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:35.224
Across the face.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.362
That's a knuckle-rake and a back-fist.

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:39.929
I step off again on the angle.

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.064
Chop to the neck.

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:42.532
Hit him up with the knee.

01:11:42.566 --> 01:11:44.734
Now that he's up, he's
injured, his nose is bleeding.

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:46.102
He's bloody, I drop levels,

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.938
two hard body-shots set him
up for the straight jab.

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:51.174
Knock-out finish.

01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:53.242
That, is how you beat a man.

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:54.378
You got that?

01:11:55.211 --> 01:11:56.045
Yup.

01:11:57.113 --> 01:11:58.114
You know, or we could just,

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.883
chop him to the neck.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:04.488
But no, what you've got is, is the best.

01:12:28.745 --> 01:12:29.546
Whoa whoa.

01:12:29.579 --> 01:12:30.380
Where are you going?

01:12:30.414 --> 01:12:31.214
I gotta go get her.

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:32.048
No, you don't.

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:32.882
It's too dangerous in there.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:33.783
Besides, we don't know

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:35.151
what's going on in front of those doors.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:35.985
They're looking for me.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:36.853
I'm gonna go in.

01:12:36.886 --> 01:12:37.954
You circle around back.

01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:39.889
Find some other way in.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.294
Great.

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:21.598
Where's Dale?

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:27.604
What?

01:13:29.573 --> 01:13:32.175
Dammit

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:34.844
Fuck, are you serious?

01:13:39.282 --> 01:13:41.150
Okay, now where's Dale?

01:13:41.184 --> 01:13:43.820
That's not your concern.

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:44.654
Is Katie safe?

01:13:44.688 --> 01:13:46.422
That is not your concern.

01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:47.457
Where is she?

01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:49.425
It's not your concern.

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:50.393
Okay tough guy.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.195
What is my concern?

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:54.297
How fast you wanna die?

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:04.708
Fight!

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:44.213
I got this.

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:14.310
Hey guy, I don't know why you're

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.746
standing there with that
stupid smile on your face

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.148
when I just took out all your men.

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:21.585
Oh, you're still gonna smile then?

01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:22.418
Alright.

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:23.887
You asked for it.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:32.696
Hiyah-hah.

01:15:36.165 --> 01:15:37.333
Wha, whoa man.

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.453
Kat.

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:58.487
Anthony!

01:15:58.521 --> 01:16:00.089
Come on, let's go.

01:16:00.123 --> 01:16:00.957
Not yet.

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:09.398
We have to see if Clark's
gonna achieve his destiny.

01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:18.875
Okay.

01:16:31.054 --> 01:16:32.288
Shirt ripper!

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:42.198
Ha ha ha, oh man!

01:16:43.366 --> 01:16:44.200
Oh, man...

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:17.901
What is he doing?

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:23.873
No!

01:17:23.907 --> 01:17:24.741
No!

01:17:32.716 --> 01:17:33.817
Ah. Don't.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:34.650
Stop.

01:17:34.684 --> 01:17:35.518
Stop it.

01:17:41.725 --> 01:17:43.526
This wasn't supposed to happen!

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:45.261
I don't give a shit about
what's supposed to happen.

01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:47.396
The Spaghettiman is dead!

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.401
I didn't hire you to do this.

01:17:52.435 --> 01:17:54.437
Look, your plan was good
but it had one problem.

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:57.140
And I fixed that problem
and made it a lot better.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:59.809
Now, we can discuss this problem.

01:17:59.843 --> 01:18:01.644
But you can take a look at what happened

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.646
to the last guy who disagreed with me.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:24.801
What the?

01:18:41.985 --> 01:18:43.086
Dale, get back here...

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:44.720
Katie, you're alive.

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:46.255
Yeah, I'm fine, uh...

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:47.791
Did you guys see
what was going on in here?

01:18:47.824 --> 01:18:48.624
I was punching.

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:49.458
I was kicking.

01:18:49.492 --> 01:18:50.526
Things were flying everywhere.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:53.429
Yeah, it was on the
camera in the other room.

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.664
Dale was recording this entire thing?

01:18:55.698 --> 01:18:57.233
I don't know.

01:18:57.266 --> 01:18:58.768
I was a little preoccupied.

01:18:58.802 --> 01:19:00.169
That sucks.

01:19:00.203 --> 01:19:01.304
It would be really cool if he was.

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:03.306
I was doing some real
ninja stuff, you know.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.574
Then I was dead!

01:19:05.608 --> 01:19:07.076
I was dead and I came back to life.

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:08.611
I'm standing right here now.

01:19:08.644 --> 01:19:10.013
Yeah, we were here.

01:19:10.046 --> 01:19:11.214
Come on Anthony.

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:12.982
Don't act like it wasn't totally cool.

01:19:13.016 --> 01:19:14.617
I don't think it
wasn't totally not cool.

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:16.285
I'm wondering if you're
gonna go catch Dale.

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:18.087
Yeah, I am.

01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:22.491
Forgot my shoes!

01:19:25.862 --> 01:19:26.729
Dale.

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.097
Dale, where are you?

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:29.232
Dale, get out here right now.

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:30.066
Dale, where did you...

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.200
Hey!

01:19:35.338 --> 01:19:36.372
Up the fire escape, Dale?

01:19:36.405 --> 01:19:39.108
How do I, you pulled up
the ladder, Dale.

01:19:39.142 --> 01:19:40.109
Damn Dale,

01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:43.446
have to chase his stupid butt
up a ladder.

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:45.548
By climbing on a pole.

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:48.584
Dale, you pulled up the
fire escape, you idiot.

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.820
Jesus, I got killed
and come back for this.

01:19:50.854 --> 01:19:53.089
Dale has me climbing up a damn building

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:55.658
chasing his stupid butt up a ladder.

01:19:55.691 --> 01:19:57.393
Judging by the state of the fire escape

01:19:57.426 --> 01:19:59.128
this roof is surely not enforced.

01:19:59.162 --> 01:20:00.363
Probably didn't even get

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:03.032
the building owner's permission...

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.701
What the hell are you doing, Dale?

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:06.535
This is it.

01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:07.370
What do you mean?

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:08.204
Don't you see?

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:09.505
This is where you're gonna become

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:10.840
the superhero you need to be.

01:20:10.874 --> 01:20:11.674
You tried to kill me

01:20:11.707 --> 01:20:12.741
down there with your ninjas!

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:14.944
No, I set you up to beat them.

01:20:14.978 --> 01:20:16.445
And now you have a choice.

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:19.015
Are you gonna kill the villain?

01:20:19.048 --> 01:20:20.749
Or are you gonna save your friend?

01:20:20.783 --> 01:20:23.286
Get away from that ledge, Dale.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:24.153
No.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:28.892
The Spaghettiman.

01:20:28.925 --> 01:20:30.226
My true friend.

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:31.627
And my hero.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:32.461
No.

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:33.529
You saved the pregnant woman.

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.031
You killed the henchman.

01:20:35.064 --> 01:20:37.633
You saved your friend and
you stopped the villain.

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:40.003
And you did it all for free.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.005
Oh God.

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:45.041
Nooooooo!

01:20:45.074 --> 01:20:46.375
Freeze!

01:20:46.409 --> 01:20:47.410
Is that, Dale?

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:48.577
Spaghettiman's getting away!

01:20:48.611 --> 01:20:49.678
Yeah, I know.

01:20:49.712 --> 01:20:51.080
Dale!

01:20:51.114 --> 01:20:52.248
What're you doing here, buddy?

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:53.983
Hahaha, this must be
real embarrassing for you.

01:20:54.017 --> 01:20:56.585
Hey, uh, you get a picture with him?

01:20:56.619 --> 01:20:57.420
Yeah yeah.

01:20:57.453 --> 01:20:58.254
Go ahead.

01:20:58.287 --> 01:20:59.088
Yeah, get in there.

01:20:59.122 --> 01:21:00.223
Put your hand out like this.

01:21:00.256 --> 01:21:01.057
Okay, now make it good.

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:01.891
There you go, yeah.

01:21:01.925 --> 01:21:02.725
Pose it.

01:21:02.758 --> 01:21:03.559
Yeah, that's a good one.

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:04.493
One, two, three.

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:05.694
Hold it, yeah.

01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:07.630
Got it?

01:21:07.663 --> 01:21:08.797
That was a good one.

01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:09.899
Do me, do me.

01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:22.578
Is everything okay?

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:25.014
Paramedics say everything's fine.

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:26.715
Looks like Dale and his ninja gang

01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:28.484
will be going away for awhile.

01:21:28.517 --> 01:21:29.752
Cool.

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:33.422
That's cool.

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:35.558
What's wrong?

01:21:35.591 --> 01:21:37.326
You stopped the bad guy and saved us.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.295
Yeah.

01:21:39.328 --> 01:21:40.629
Yeah I know.

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:41.764
For free too.

01:21:42.798 --> 01:21:44.867
I know you probably
don't wanna hear this...

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.335
But you're a hero.

01:21:46.369 --> 01:21:48.404
Gaaaaah.

01:21:48.437 --> 01:21:49.705
You saved Kat.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.240
For free.

01:21:51.274 --> 01:21:52.375
And my children.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:53.542
For free.

01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:55.144
And you saved my life.

01:21:55.178 --> 01:21:57.280
For free!

01:21:57.313 --> 01:21:58.147
I know.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:02.918
And for that, I'll always
be in your debt.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:08.191
Wait.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:10.726
Wait, your debt?

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:11.627
Like...

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.695
Like you owe me something?

01:22:12.728 --> 01:22:14.730
Well, it's more like a figure of speech.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.032
Like I owe you one, or...

01:22:16.065 --> 01:22:17.000
Yeah. Yeah!

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:18.401
Like you owe me one.

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:19.602
Like you borrowed some money.

01:22:19.635 --> 01:22:21.070
No. It's not literal.

01:22:21.104 --> 01:22:22.438
It's like...

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:23.639
Yes!

01:22:28.544 --> 01:22:29.378
Hey!

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:32.015
Where are you going?

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:35.818
I guess you're gonna have to

01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:39.222
listen to that police scanner
to find out.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:01.644
It's 11 miles home to my place.

01:23:01.677 --> 01:23:02.945
I'll get a ride home with you.
