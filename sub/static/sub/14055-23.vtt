WEBVTT

00:08.394 --> 00:10.394
if I have to sacrifice our friendship
to be with Summer

00:10.394 --> 00:11.354
I'll do it

00:12.314 --> 00:13.474
I'm worried about how much you're drinking

00:13.754 --> 00:14.794
I love you

00:14.794 --> 00:17.234
pull over,and I'll come get you.

00:33.714 --> 00:35.634
Ryan?

00:36.554 --> 00:38.514
Ryan?

00:40.194 --> 00:41.754
Hey, Ryan.

00:44.634 --> 00:45.954
What time is it?

00:45.994 --> 00:48.154
Eh, it's 5:30... ish.

00:48.234 --> 00:49.834
Showing up
earlier and earlier.

00:49.914 --> 00:52.194
Yeah, well, we have a
lot of ground to cover,

00:52.274 --> 00:54.034
so I figured,
since we're both up,

00:54.114 --> 00:55.714
we may as well
get a jump on it.

00:55.754 --> 00:57.554
Yeah, I know.
We've been over this.

00:57.634 --> 00:59.754
Summer doesn't want you,
she doesn't want Zach--

00:59.794 --> 01:00.994
all there is to it.

01:01.074 --> 01:03.994
Good night.

01:04.034 --> 01:05.594
But something
occurred to me--

01:05.674 --> 01:06.714
a new wrinkle.

01:06.754 --> 01:07.954
What, the prom?
Yeah.

01:07.994 --> 01:09.994
And I have to convince Summer
to go with me.

01:10.074 --> 01:11.514
We-- as a couple, Ryan--

01:11.554 --> 01:15.194
must partake in the magical rite
of passage known as "the prom."

01:15.274 --> 01:17.594
Ah, you mean people
getting drunk, making out,

01:17.634 --> 01:19.074
throwing up
on the gym floor?

01:19.114 --> 01:20.474
No, I mean
romance, Ryan.

01:20.554 --> 01:23.674
I mean tuxedos, corsages,
the limousines.

01:23.714 --> 01:25.074
I don't know, man,
I don't see Summer

01:25.114 --> 01:26.474
really buying in
to the prom thing.

01:26.514 --> 01:28.554
You're wrong about that--
Summer's been fantasizing

01:28.594 --> 01:29.794
about prom since fifth grade.

01:29.874 --> 01:31.194
How do you know that?

01:31.234 --> 01:33.154
Sat behind her and Marissa
in computer class.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.234
Really honed my eavesdropping
skills that year.

01:35.274 --> 01:36.994
Point is, Summer's

01:37.074 --> 01:38.914
forever dreamt of
going to the prom,

01:38.954 --> 01:41.394
and I, in turn, would
dream of going with her.

01:41.474 --> 01:43.314
Well, you need to get that
out of your mind.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.754
If it helps at all,
I don't think I'm
gonna go, either.

01:45.834 --> 01:47.714
Look, just 'cause you saw Trey
leaving Marissa's

01:47.754 --> 01:48.994
does not mean
they're hooking up.

01:49.034 --> 01:50.754
Yeah? What does it mean?

01:50.834 --> 01:53.194
Maybe he went over to borrow
something, like a book.

01:53.274 --> 01:54.714
Or one of her
newsboy caps.

01:54.794 --> 01:56.194
Yeah, or maybe they hooked up.

01:56.274 --> 01:58.434
Okay, you're just... married

01:58.474 --> 02:00.074
to the worst possible
scenario, huh?

02:00.154 --> 02:02.354
Look, I'm gonna talk to her
about it today,

02:02.434 --> 02:05.354
but whatever happened, she seems
dead set on keeping it from me.

02:07.074 --> 02:09.114
It's kind of early
for a phone call.

02:09.193 --> 02:11.434
Kind of early
for a lot of things.
Hello?

02:11.474 --> 02:14.714
Dad? Where...
where are you?

02:17.034 --> 02:19.194
Oh, my God.

02:19.234 --> 02:21.474
Okay. Uh, yeah.

02:21.554 --> 02:23.874
We'll be
right there.
What is it?

02:23.954 --> 02:26.194
My mom got in a car accident--
she's at the hospital.

02:27.794 --> 02:30.514

Oh, honey,

03:11.207 --> 03:13.727
I am so glad you're okay.

03:13.807 --> 03:15.367
I'm so sorry.

03:15.407 --> 03:17.327
We'll get through this.

03:17.772 --> 03:19.412
I promise.

03:24.332 --> 03:26.092
They had to cut it off.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.252
Well,

03:27.332 --> 03:28.972
you were due for an upgrade,
anyway.

03:31.572 --> 03:33.892
Mom. You okay?

03:33.932 --> 03:35.932
Oh, I'm fine.

03:36.012 --> 03:37.052
The doctor says she

03:37.132 --> 03:38.452
has a concussion,
but fortunately,

03:38.532 --> 03:40.452
no internal
injuries.
What happened?

03:40.492 --> 03:42.652
Talking on the cell phone.
Stupid.

03:42.732 --> 03:44.212
Thank God for airbags.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.612
Well, is there
anything we can do?

03:45.692 --> 03:46.772
Oh, not a thing.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.172
I'll just probably spend
the day on the couch.

03:49.252 --> 03:50.812
Well, under the circumstances,

03:50.852 --> 03:53.292
I'll lift my parental ban
on my DVD collection.

03:53.372 --> 03:54.412
What an honor.

03:54.452 --> 03:55.812
It is. You can watch
anything you want.

03:55.852 --> 03:59.332
Uh, House of Flying Daggers,
Evil Dead II.

03:59.412 --> 04:03.732
If you must, X-Men One and Two,
but you got to do One first.

04:03.812 --> 04:05.972
Oh? I kind of...
That's sort of the catch.
No, Two's better.

04:06.052 --> 04:08.572
I don't know what
to tell you, Sandy.

04:08.612 --> 04:10.172
She blew a .08.

04:11.532 --> 04:13.132
Look,

04:13.212 --> 04:14.772
maybe...

04:14.852 --> 04:16.452
maybe I read it wrong.

04:16.531 --> 04:20.212
Maybe it was a .07.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.971
I'm not asking
you to do that.

04:22.052 --> 04:26.292
Just promise me
you'll get her some help.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.292
So it's an
underwater thing?

04:28.372 --> 04:31.052
Yeah, but it turns out
that's a lot more work
than I thought.

04:31.092 --> 04:32.452
Oh.
Do you have any idea

04:32.492 --> 04:34.252
how to make
a papier-mÃ¢ch\ octopus?

04:34.332 --> 04:38.172
No. But maybe Ryan
could bring you one
instead of a corsage.

04:38.252 --> 04:41.452
I don't think Ryan's gonna
be bringing me anything.

04:41.532 --> 04:45.012
But... you guys are
going to the prom
together, right?

04:45.052 --> 04:46.612
I wouldn't count on it.

04:46.692 --> 04:48.372
Coop, did I miss
something?

04:48.452 --> 04:50.692
'Cause for, like, a blip,
you guys actually seemed happy.

04:50.772 --> 04:51.932
It's complicated.

04:51.972 --> 04:53.892
Well, it's you and Ryan--
it's supposed to be.

04:53.972 --> 04:55.532
Can we not talk
about this anymore?

04:55.612 --> 04:56.932
Yeah.

04:56.972 --> 04:58.332
Coop, you okay?

04:58.372 --> 04:59.852
Fine. I'm fine.

04:59.932 --> 05:01.892
So everyone's saying
you're gonna be voted
Prom Queen.

05:01.972 --> 05:04.132
Isn't that, like,
your fifth-grade
dream coming true?

05:04.212 --> 05:06.452
No. My dream involved
an actual date:

05:06.532 --> 05:09.492
a hot guy in a tux
with a carnation
pinned to his lapel.

05:09.572 --> 05:12.692
Instead, I'm drawing straws
between nerd boy and ass clown.

05:12.732 --> 05:14.012
So what are you
gonna do, not go?

05:14.052 --> 05:15.852
Exactly. If I go,
I have to decide

05:15.932 --> 05:17.132
between Seth and Zach.

05:17.212 --> 05:19.332
Fast forward to prom:
there's me standing alone,

05:19.412 --> 05:21.332
while the two of them
wrestle on the floor

05:21.372 --> 05:22.852
like two girls in a mud pit.
Summ,

05:22.892 --> 05:24.252
I'm building the lost
city of Atlantis

05:24.332 --> 05:26.412
out of streamers and tape;
you got to at least show up.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.812
Fine. If you work out
your mysterious issues

05:28.892 --> 05:30.932
with Ryan,
then maybe I'll go.

05:31.012 --> 05:34.052
I wouldn't hold my breath.

05:35.492 --> 05:38.212
So, how is she?
Well, the doctor
says she'll be fine.

05:38.252 --> 05:39.372
She's resting now.

05:39.452 --> 05:41.652
I... I should've
seen this coming.

05:41.692 --> 05:44.012
So she's been hitting the bottle
a little hard lately.

05:44.092 --> 05:46.132
It's been a rough couple
of weeks for everyone.

05:46.212 --> 05:47.812
Even me.

05:49.332 --> 05:50.492
Okay,

05:50.572 --> 05:52.092
I'll bite.

05:52.172 --> 05:53.932
So, what's the problem?

05:53.972 --> 05:57.212
Sandy, I did not come here
to talk about myself.

05:58.372 --> 05:59.852
But as long
as we're on the subject,

05:59.932 --> 06:01.652
I could kind of use
your advice.

06:01.732 --> 06:03.492
Hey, if this involves
you being naked,

06:03.532 --> 06:05.292
please, y-you got
to warn me.

06:05.372 --> 06:07.932
It's my prenup.
Oh.

06:09.812 --> 06:12.532
Well, it says here,
if you and Caleb
are married

06:12.572 --> 06:14.972
for a year, you get
$3 million at least.

06:15.052 --> 06:16.932
If you have been married
for less than a year,

06:16.972 --> 06:19.252
you get nothing.

06:19.292 --> 06:20.692
11 months, 27 days.

06:20.772 --> 06:23.052
Why do you think he's
in such a rush to divorce me?

06:23.092 --> 06:25.532
I'm not surprised.
He's a wily old guy.

06:25.572 --> 06:26.692
He's a cheap son of a bitch,

06:26.772 --> 06:28.332
who wants to throw me
out on the street.

06:28.412 --> 06:30.212
Sandy, please,
you've got to find a loophole.

06:30.252 --> 06:32.132
I don't know,
Julie, this looks
ironclad to me.

06:32.172 --> 06:34.132
All Caleb has to do
is file the papers

06:34.172 --> 06:35.812
by Monday with the County Clerk.

06:35.892 --> 06:38.052
Unless you can figure out
a way to stop him...

06:38.092 --> 06:39.732
you're out of luck.

06:48.972 --> 06:50.732
Hey.

06:50.772 --> 06:51.972
Cohen.

06:52.052 --> 06:53.172
Dude...

06:53.212 --> 06:54.772
I'm so sorry
about the launch.

06:54.852 --> 06:56.932
I had a...
Bruce Banner moment.

06:57.012 --> 06:58.812
Yeah. Eh, we're
both to blame.

06:58.892 --> 07:00.972
Let's put it behind us.
Okay, like it
never happened.

07:01.052 --> 07:02.892
Yeah.
Okay. I'm going
this way.

07:02.972 --> 07:05.012
You think Summer's
willing to forget
about it?

07:05.052 --> 07:07.292
Sure. If she sees how mature
we're being. Right?

07:07.372 --> 07:09.492
Look how much we've grown
since the other day.

07:09.532 --> 07:11.812
We're shaking hands,
we're using brains
instead of brawn.

07:11.892 --> 07:13.812
We're no longer ruled
by our Y chromosomes.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.492
No, we're civilized
gentlemen, Zach.

07:15.572 --> 07:18.492
We can handle any situation
with grace and dignity.

07:18.532 --> 07:19.732
Oh,

07:19.812 --> 07:21.172
here comes
our first test.

07:21.212 --> 07:22.252
Summer, hey.

07:22.332 --> 07:23.532
We were both
just talking...

07:23.612 --> 07:25.412
Save it, Cohen.
Okay.

07:25.492 --> 07:26.652
I'm done listening
to your excuses.

07:26.732 --> 07:27.932
Look, Summer,
we're really sorry.

07:27.972 --> 07:29.412
Are you willing
to forgive us?

07:29.452 --> 07:30.932
Nope. Don't want
to forgive you.

07:31.012 --> 07:32.892
But prom is
tomorrow night,

07:32.932 --> 07:34.732
and I have wanted to go
my whole life.

07:34.812 --> 07:37.252
So I'm not gonna let
our demented little threesome

07:37.332 --> 07:38.452
ruin that for me.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.572
So I'm going...

07:39.612 --> 07:40.972
with one of you.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.732
Well, which one of us
are you gonna take?

07:43.812 --> 07:45.332
Don't care.
I am too pissed off

07:45.372 --> 07:47.652
and tired to choose,
so you're gonna decide.

07:47.692 --> 07:49.852
Don't care how,
but tomorrow, I
will be in front

07:49.932 --> 07:51.412
of my house in a dress,
and one of you

07:51.492 --> 07:52.772
will pick me up.
Got it? Good.

07:53.972 --> 07:55.252
Oh.

07:55.332 --> 07:56.932
You know, my dress
is a magenta color,

07:57.012 --> 07:59.532
so my corsage should be
in that general family.

07:59.572 --> 08:00.652
Hm.

08:00.692 --> 08:02.452
Dude, she is totally
hanging by a thread.

08:02.532 --> 08:05.052
Yeah, okay, I'll take
one for the team-- I'll
take her to the prom.

08:05.132 --> 08:06.852
No way.
Why do you get to go?

08:06.932 --> 08:10.652
Because, dude,
I saw her first.

08:10.692 --> 08:12.412
That doesn't make sense.

08:12.452 --> 08:14.372
Sure it does.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.612
I got a text message
from Reed.

08:16.652 --> 08:18.292
She wants to meet us
at the diner for lunch?

08:18.372 --> 08:20.052
Dude, the ladies
are all over us,

08:20.132 --> 08:22.092
and not in a good way.
Okay, listen,

08:22.172 --> 08:24.012
I say we go to the diner,
we meet with Reed,

08:24.092 --> 08:25.812
then we deal with
this Summer thing later.

08:25.852 --> 08:27.692
All right, one
battle at a time.

08:40.412 --> 08:41.412
What is that?

08:41.491 --> 08:43.092
It's the best facility
on the West Coast.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.172
You're sending me to rehab?

08:45.212 --> 08:47.892
I'm asking you...
to get help.

08:47.932 --> 08:49.132
Nobody needs to know.

08:49.212 --> 08:51.132
We can say you...
you're taking a trip.

08:51.172 --> 08:53.212
In this town, a trip
is always rehab.

08:53.252 --> 08:54.892
All I care about is you.
Then you don't

08:54.972 --> 08:56.572
have to worry about me;
I'm done with drinking.

08:56.652 --> 08:58.212
Just like that, huh?

08:58.252 --> 09:00.132
Last night scared me.

09:00.172 --> 09:01.572
You don't just snap your fingers

09:01.652 --> 09:03.372
and make something
like this disappear.

09:03.452 --> 09:05.692
Well, you do when you
could lose everything.

09:05.732 --> 09:08.092
And last night,
I almost did.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.412
Look...

09:12.492 --> 09:14.212
I'm going to
the kitchen now,

09:14.292 --> 09:17.132
and I'm gonna pour out
every drop in this house.

09:23.572 --> 09:24.972
Are you coming?

09:25.052 --> 09:27.052
Right behind you.

09:40.132 --> 09:41.292
Marissa.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.292
Hey.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.212
Look, I know there's
something going on,
so just tell me.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.772
Tell you what?

09:47.852 --> 09:49.852
I saw Trey leaving
your house last night.

09:52.252 --> 09:53.612
It's not what you think.

09:53.692 --> 09:56.132
Yeah? Well, I asked
you what happened
when I was in Miami,

09:56.212 --> 09:57.772
and you're not
talking, so...

09:57.852 --> 09:59.412
I'm taking my best guess.

09:59.452 --> 10:00.572
Which is?

10:00.612 --> 10:01.972
You and Trey?

10:02.052 --> 10:04.052
What, you think
we hooked up?

10:05.612 --> 10:07.692
You know what,
thanks a lot for the vote

10:07.732 --> 10:09.092
of confidence.
Hey, look, you've been

10:09.172 --> 10:10.452
acting strange
ever since I got back.

10:10.532 --> 10:11.652
Trey's avoiding me.

10:11.732 --> 10:13.292
What am I supposed
to think?

10:13.372 --> 10:17.052
You're supposed to give
me a little more credit.
Okay, fine.

10:17.132 --> 10:18.612
Tell me.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.652
I didn't hook up with him.

10:21.692 --> 10:22.932
And if you don't

10:23.012 --> 10:24.332
believe me,
why don't you ask

10:24.372 --> 10:25.892
your brother
what happened.

10:32.747 --> 10:34.627
I understand you're
probably

10:34.707 --> 10:36.787
a little bit upset
about the launch.

10:36.867 --> 10:38.987
Well, I think one day
pretty soon,

10:39.067 --> 10:41.907
we're all gonna have
a good laugh about this.

10:41.947 --> 10:43.587
Ha, ha, ha.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.467
I know that day feels far off,

10:45.547 --> 10:48.867
but comedy is just tragedy
plus time.

10:48.947 --> 10:50.587
Reed, we're
really sorry.

10:50.667 --> 10:53.227
We had a huge opportunity
and we blew it.

10:53.227 --> 10:54.467
I hope we can make it up to you.

10:54.547 --> 10:55.547
Thank you, Zach.

10:55.627 --> 10:56.747
I was gonna say that.

10:56.827 --> 10:58.707
Look, I hate to give you guys
good news,

10:58.787 --> 11:02.147
but, unfortunately,
I have some.

11:02.227 --> 11:04.427
George Lucas is interested
in Atomic County.

11:04.467 --> 11:06.347
He might want to make it
into his next movie.

11:06.427 --> 11:07.307
Oh, my God.

11:08.347 --> 11:09.507
This is incredible.

11:09.547 --> 11:10.627
Oh, my God,
it's happening.

11:10.707 --> 11:12.347
We're this decade's, uh, uh,
Matt and Ben.

11:12.427 --> 11:13.667
Look, he's coming
to town,

11:13.747 --> 11:15.267
and he wants to sit down
with you guys.

11:15.307 --> 11:16.347
But here's the deal.

11:16.427 --> 11:18.187
Only one of you
can take the meeting.

11:18.267 --> 11:19.347
What?
Reed?

11:19.387 --> 11:21.667
Face it: you two
can't do anything together

11:21.747 --> 11:23.187
except whine about Summer.

11:23.227 --> 11:24.507
I can't face
another debacle.

11:24.587 --> 11:25.987
I can't handle
another debacle.

11:26.027 --> 11:27.427
I... no.

11:27.507 --> 11:28.507
One.

11:30.427 --> 11:32.267
Which one of us do you want?

11:32.347 --> 11:34.947
Unfortunately, I am pissed off
enough that I don't even care.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.187
But George is coming
to town tomorrow night,

11:37.187 --> 11:38.907
so he and I will be
at Il Fornaio,

11:38.947 --> 11:40.147
and one of you will be there.

11:41.747 --> 11:44.107
And if either of you
utter the name "Summer,"

11:44.187 --> 11:45.987
so help me God...

11:47.427 --> 11:48.867
Dude, this is amazing.

11:48.907 --> 11:50.387
I have to go to that meeting.

11:50.427 --> 11:52.227
Do you realize what this
could do for me?

11:52.307 --> 11:53.467
Hold on, buddy.

11:53.507 --> 11:54.347
I've been dreaming
about meeting Lucas

11:54.427 --> 11:55.267
since I was, like, a fetus.

11:55.347 --> 11:56.227
I thought you wanted to go

11:56.307 --> 11:57.187
to prom with Summer.

11:57.267 --> 11:58.667
I think you said that, too.

11:58.707 --> 12:00.107
I think you...
yeah, you did.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.867
All right, I...

12:01.907 --> 12:04.787
So one of us takes the meeting,
the other one goes to prom.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.347
All right.

12:06.427 --> 12:08.227
Do you have any ideas
how to settle this?

12:09.787 --> 12:11.427
No.

12:11.507 --> 12:13.387
Not even one.

12:15.507 --> 12:16.507
How is she?

12:16.547 --> 12:18.107
Well, she's doing
all right.

12:18.187 --> 12:19.107
A little rattled.

12:19.187 --> 12:20.067
I hoped
she'd be rattled.

12:20.147 --> 12:22.107
Drunk driving at her age?

12:22.147 --> 12:23.507
It's a disgrace.

12:23.587 --> 12:26.387
What Kirsten needs right now
is a little support.

12:26.467 --> 12:28.187
If you can't give her that,
then show yourself out.

12:28.227 --> 12:30.987
I see you're employing
your usual softball approach.

12:31.067 --> 12:33.427
That might be appropriate when
your son runs off to Portland,

12:33.507 --> 12:34.907
but this is a tad more serious.

12:34.987 --> 12:36.067
I know how to help my wife.

12:36.147 --> 12:38.147
Sandy...

12:38.227 --> 12:40.307
I, uh, I can...
I can handle this.

12:40.387 --> 12:41.347
Okay.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.947
I'll be outside.

12:42.987 --> 12:44.427
Behave yourself.

12:45.987 --> 12:47.907
I'm glad to see
you're still in one piece.

12:47.947 --> 12:49.627
Dad, I know
you're worried,

12:49.667 --> 12:51.107
but I'm fine.

12:51.147 --> 12:52.987
See? Couple
of sprained fingers.

12:53.027 --> 12:55.427
Not the end
of the world.

12:55.467 --> 12:58.107
So, how are things
at the office?

13:00.067 --> 13:01.187
You could have been killed.

13:01.227 --> 13:02.427
I learned my lesson.

13:02.507 --> 13:03.387
Always eat dinner.

13:03.467 --> 13:04.547
Is that the lesson

13:04.627 --> 13:06.547
to be learned
here?

13:06.587 --> 13:08.067
I made an error in judgment.

13:08.107 --> 13:09.907
You should be familiar
with that.

13:09.987 --> 13:11.827
This is not about me, Kiki.

13:11.907 --> 13:13.227
You have a problem.

13:15.147 --> 13:17.227
And, my God, did you give
any thought to your kids?

13:17.307 --> 13:19.427
I am a good mother.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.267
You're also an alcoholic.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.707
Your mother was one, too.

13:24.787 --> 13:26.427
She did her best to hide it,
but I always knew.

13:26.507 --> 13:29.947
Why do you think Mom drank
the way she did?

13:30.027 --> 13:32.867
Why do you think Hailey
left the house at 17?

13:32.947 --> 13:35.627
If this family is screwed up,
it's because of you.

13:35.707 --> 13:37.227
I gave you everything
you ever wanted!

13:37.267 --> 13:40.867
I may like my Chardonnay,
but I am not gonna die alone,

13:40.907 --> 13:43.507
and that's more
than I can say for you!

13:51.947 --> 13:54.187
Trey!

13:54.267 --> 13:56.067
Trey, you in there?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.507
Trey, look, it's me.

14:08.547 --> 14:11.307
I know you're avoiding me, but
I need to talk to you, so...

14:11.387 --> 14:12.267
do me a favor:

14:12.347 --> 14:13.547
call me back. Bye.

14:27.387 --> 14:28.427
Summer?

14:29.387 --> 14:30.347
What do you want?

14:30.427 --> 14:32.107
We both want to take you
to the prom.

14:32.187 --> 14:34.307
Now, I know it feels
like deep down

14:34.387 --> 14:35.867
you hate us both
equally,

14:35.907 --> 14:38.707
but somewhere,
if you look
inside yourself,

14:38.747 --> 14:41.027
you've got to hate
one of us less.

14:41.107 --> 14:42.307
I've tried choosing.

14:42.387 --> 14:43.787
When Seth went to Portland,
I chose Zach.

14:43.867 --> 14:45.707
When Zach went to Italy,
I chose Seth.

14:45.787 --> 14:47.627
Somehow, it just doesn't seem
to stick.

14:47.667 --> 14:48.667
So I'm done deciding.

14:48.747 --> 14:50.067
I am leaving it up to you guys.

14:50.107 --> 14:51.187
Well, what if we
can't decide?

14:51.267 --> 14:52.227
Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Flip a coin.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.107
I don't care how you do it.

14:54.147 --> 14:55.387
Bye.

14:56.827 --> 14:58.547
So heads,
I go to the prom,

14:58.587 --> 14:59.507
tails, you go?

14:59.587 --> 15:00.667
Okay, fine.

15:00.707 --> 15:02.107
No, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

15:02.147 --> 15:03.147
No, no changies.

15:03.227 --> 15:04.467
No, I think
we should wait.

15:04.507 --> 15:05.987
If we flip
the coin right now,

15:06.027 --> 15:07.187
we're both gonna try

15:07.227 --> 15:08.747
and get out of whatever
we're supposed to do.

15:08.827 --> 15:10.467
But if we wait till
right before the prom...

15:10.547 --> 15:12.907
Neither of us
will have a chance
to back out.

15:12.947 --> 15:14.427
So I'll meet you at your house
before the prom?

15:14.467 --> 15:15.947
Fine.

15:30.947 --> 15:32.827
Something tells me
you talked to Marissa.

15:32.907 --> 15:33.867
Yeah.

15:33.947 --> 15:34.867
Said she didn't hook up
with Trey.

15:34.907 --> 15:36.547
Which is good news,
right?

15:36.587 --> 15:38.267
Something happened between them.
I know it.

15:38.347 --> 15:39.507
Well, have you tried
talking to Trey,

15:39.547 --> 15:40.507
seeing what he says?

15:40.547 --> 15:41.787
I went over to his place today.

15:41.867 --> 15:42.747
He wasn't there.

15:42.827 --> 15:44.227
And he's not taking my calls.

15:44.227 --> 15:46.107
All right, then your options
are "A": you can sit here,

15:46.147 --> 15:47.467
and you can spin
conspiracy theories

15:47.507 --> 15:50.587
about Trey and Marissa,
or "B": you can believe her.

15:50.667 --> 15:51.907
Now, my personal
recommendation...

15:51.987 --> 15:53.067
Let me guess, "B".

15:53.147 --> 15:54.147
Yes, "B",
believe her,

15:54.187 --> 15:55.907
and might I add, first of all,

15:55.947 --> 15:57.787
that you have no reason not to.

15:57.827 --> 15:59.107
But if you believe her,

15:59.187 --> 16:01.547
you can put this weird,
non-fight behind you guys,

16:01.627 --> 16:03.027
and you can go to prom together.

16:03.107 --> 16:04.347
I don't really think

16:04.427 --> 16:05.627
I'm in the mood to go to prom.

16:05.707 --> 16:06.947
You have to go, and look,

16:07.027 --> 16:08.947
maybe I've seen too many
Saved By the Bells,

16:09.027 --> 16:10.427
but if it's taught me
anything,

16:10.467 --> 16:11.947
it sure has taught me
that prom

16:12.027 --> 16:13.747
is a seminal moment, okay?

16:13.787 --> 16:15.467
It's meant to be shared.

16:15.507 --> 16:16.827
Is this about you and Summer?

16:16.907 --> 16:18.787
No.

16:18.867 --> 16:19.907
Maybe. I don't...

16:19.987 --> 16:21.027
yes, but only because

16:21.067 --> 16:22.587
Summer and I
aren't gonna go to our prom

16:22.667 --> 16:23.747
'cause of some
stupid fight.

16:23.827 --> 16:25.227
So you should
really learn

16:25.267 --> 16:27.187
from the error
of my ways. Please?

16:27.227 --> 16:29.627
Somebody really should.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.507
Oh...

16:35.587 --> 16:39.227
Well...
is this a booty call?

16:39.267 --> 16:40.467
Not in the least.

16:40.547 --> 16:42.907
I've come for
my sleeping pills.

16:42.947 --> 16:44.947
Oh. Well, they're upstairs.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.547
Yeah, I haven't
been sleeping
very well, either.

16:53.627 --> 16:55.827
This divorce,
it's so... ugly.

16:55.907 --> 16:57.347
No, it's not that.

16:57.427 --> 17:00.347
I had an argument with Kirsten,
our worst yet.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.267
I just can't stop thinking
about it.

17:02.307 --> 17:05.547
Oh, well, I'm just
thinking outside
the box here,

17:05.587 --> 17:07.146
but you could
apologize.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.307
No, couldn't face her.

17:08.387 --> 17:09.426
So write her a letter.

17:09.507 --> 17:10.666
Say all the things

17:10.707 --> 17:11.906
you're too stubborn
to say to her face.

17:13.067 --> 17:14.186
Come on.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.146
We both know you can't
stand to fight with her.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.987
Sometimes you surprise me,
Juju.

17:22.467 --> 17:25.307
Hang on, I'll get
your pills.

17:29.147 --> 17:31.027
Orange bottle,

17:31.107 --> 17:32.267
blue and white label.

17:32.347 --> 17:33.627
Little black and white things.

17:33.707 --> 17:34.587
I know.

17:34.627 --> 17:36.467
Just a second.

17:42.707 --> 17:46.307
I could've found them in half
the time without my glasses.

17:46.387 --> 17:47.747
Okay, okay. Here.

17:47.787 --> 17:49.307
Now, make sure
you only take one.

17:49.387 --> 17:50.747
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Wait, Cal, wait.

17:50.787 --> 17:53.627
Would you like to do something
tomorrow night?

17:53.667 --> 17:54.867
Maybe get together?

17:54.947 --> 17:56.347
You asking me out
on a date?

17:56.387 --> 17:57.627
Is that so odd?

17:58.987 --> 18:00.387
All right, I guess it is.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.667
But just think of it
as one last hurrah.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.707
It'll probably be
the last night
we ever spend together.

18:04.787 --> 18:08.627
Julie, you're not gonna seduce
me out of this divorce.

18:08.667 --> 18:11.507
I'm meeting my lawyer tomorrow
to finalize the paperwork,

18:11.547 --> 18:13.787
and I'm filing bright
and early Monday morning.

18:13.827 --> 18:14.827
So send me the papers.

18:14.867 --> 18:15.827
I'll make the marks.

18:15.907 --> 18:17.227
We'll make a party
out of it.

18:18.547 --> 18:19.947
Oh, why not.

18:19.987 --> 18:21.827
Fitting end to a bizarre
marriage like ours.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.347
So I'll see you tomorrow?

18:23.387 --> 18:24.787
See you tomorrow.

18:42.256 --> 18:43.256
Hi.

18:45.416 --> 18:46.856
Hi.

18:46.356 --> 18:50.276
So... I'm sorry I went
off on you yesterday.

18:50.356 --> 18:51.476
I was confused.

18:51.556 --> 18:53.596
I get it.

18:53.676 --> 18:55.236
I know I've been kind
of all over the map
lately, too, so...

18:55.316 --> 18:56.916
No, no. You say nothing
happened, and I believe you.

18:59.116 --> 19:00.356
You feel like
going to prom?

19:00.396 --> 19:01.636
You mean it?

19:01.716 --> 19:03.356
Yeah. Yeah.

19:08.436 --> 19:10.516
I thought you weren't
into PDA at school.

19:10.556 --> 19:11.476
I'm coming around.

19:11.556 --> 19:12.516
Uh-huh.

19:22.636 --> 19:24.716
Morning.

19:24.756 --> 19:26.796
Morning.

19:26.876 --> 19:29.396
Did you sleep
at all last night?

19:29.436 --> 19:30.716
Not a wink.

19:33.716 --> 19:34.796
Listen, I'm an expert

19:34.876 --> 19:36.436
at fighting
with your father.

19:36.516 --> 19:38.276
And believe me,
every time

19:38.316 --> 19:40.676
you think
you've driven him away,

19:40.756 --> 19:43.116
he comes roaring back
asking for more.

19:43.156 --> 19:44.676
You couldn't beat him off
with a stick.

19:44.716 --> 19:47.196
Oh. But the things I said.

19:47.196 --> 19:49.196
He'll forgive you.

19:49.276 --> 19:51.636
Give it some time.

19:51.716 --> 19:52.916
I guess so.

19:55.796 --> 19:58.556
How about we lay low tonight?

19:58.636 --> 20:00.356
We'll order some take-out.

20:00.396 --> 20:02.196
Maybe watch
one of Seth's DVDs.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.356
I should try
and talk to my dad.

20:06.396 --> 20:11.636
If we're gonna get through
this all by ourselves...

20:11.716 --> 20:14.596
we need to get back
on solid ground.

20:15.956 --> 20:18.956
Well, I've never seen
House of Flying Daggers.

20:27.716 --> 20:28.756
Scared you.

20:28.796 --> 20:29.796
Jess.

20:29.876 --> 20:31.076
Walk me to class.

20:31.116 --> 20:32.476
I feel like we haven't chatted
in a while.

20:32.556 --> 20:33.596
What do you want?

20:33.636 --> 20:35.116
A date for the prom.

20:35.156 --> 20:36.156
You taken?

20:36.236 --> 20:37.756
Yeah.
Let me guess.

20:37.836 --> 20:38.876
Marissa Cooper?

20:38.956 --> 20:41.076
It doesn't bother you,

20:41.116 --> 20:43.156
getting your brother's
sloppy seconds?

20:43.196 --> 20:46.876
Look, nothing happened
between Marissa and Trey, okay?

20:46.956 --> 20:50.636
You're getting your chain
yanked, Atwood... bad.

20:50.676 --> 20:51.676
All right, fine.
You got the story,

20:51.756 --> 20:52.676
I'd love to hear it.

20:52.716 --> 20:53.996
Ask your brother.

20:54.076 --> 20:56.036
Although I don't think
he's too anxious to share,

20:56.076 --> 20:57.636
since he took off
for Chino last night.

20:59.876 --> 21:02.196
You better not be screwing
with me.

21:02.276 --> 21:04.636
Apparently, I'm
the only one who's not.

21:08.116 --> 21:09.756
Okay.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.836
I'm prepared for whatever
fate throws my way tonight.

21:12.916 --> 21:13.916
I have a tuxedo pressed,

21:13.996 --> 21:15.196
in case I'm going
to the prom.

21:15.236 --> 21:16.116
Mine's in the trunk.

21:16.196 --> 21:17.396
All right.

21:17.476 --> 21:20.716
And if I am, in fact,
meeting with George Lucas...

21:20.756 --> 21:23.476
I have my Boba Fett T-shirt.

21:23.556 --> 21:25.076
Dude, it's a little small.

21:25.156 --> 21:26.876
I got it when I was eight.
Hopefully, it'll stretch.

21:26.916 --> 21:27.836
Shall we?

21:27.876 --> 21:29.796
You do the honors.
Okay.

21:29.836 --> 21:30.996
Heads, I go to the prom,
tails, you.

21:31.076 --> 21:31.836
Great.

21:39.516 --> 21:40.556
Works for me.

21:40.636 --> 21:42.076
Just as I hoped.

21:42.116 --> 21:43.076
Good luck
tonight, man.

21:43.156 --> 21:44.076
Yeah.
Have fun.

21:44.156 --> 21:45.316
Same to you.

22:00.076 --> 22:01.516
Julie.

22:06.356 --> 22:09.076
Just a second.

22:09.116 --> 22:10.676
Uh, I'm coming!

22:16.156 --> 22:17.996
You're early.

22:18.076 --> 22:19.876
I see you've pulled out
all the stops.

22:19.956 --> 22:22.356
One last-ditch effort

22:22.396 --> 22:24.236
to stop this divorce
from going forward.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.836
God. Paranoid much?

22:26.916 --> 22:28.476
I just wanted
one last night with you.

22:28.516 --> 22:32.436
And if you don't
believe me... here.

22:32.516 --> 22:33.756
You signed.

22:33.796 --> 22:34.716
Told ya.

22:34.756 --> 22:36.556
So now maybe
you can relax.

22:36.636 --> 22:38.636
Have a drink,
take a dip, hmm?

22:38.716 --> 22:40.076
Here.

22:40.156 --> 22:42.516
I made it just the
way you like it;

22:42.596 --> 22:46.516
on the rocks,
plenty of salt.

22:55.276 --> 22:57.156
I think I'll start
with a scotch.

22:57.236 --> 22:59.476
Okay. No hurry on the margs.

22:59.556 --> 23:00.596
Scotch it is.

23:16.276 --> 23:17.236
All right.

23:27.236 --> 23:29.236
Ry. Good to see you, man.

23:29.276 --> 23:30.276
Cut the crap, Trey.

23:30.356 --> 23:31.316
You got something
you want to tell me?

23:31.396 --> 23:33.116
What do you mean?

23:33.156 --> 23:34.036
About Marissa?

23:37.356 --> 23:39.276
All right.

23:39.356 --> 23:42.556
Fine, let's, uh,
take a seat, get a drink.

23:45.596 --> 23:47.316
Uh, two Seven and Sevens.

23:47.356 --> 23:49.716
Uh, one Seven and Seven,

23:49.796 --> 23:51.356
and one just Seven.

23:54.556 --> 23:55.756
When you were in Miami,

23:55.796 --> 23:57.756
Marissa and I,
we got drunk together.

23:57.836 --> 23:58.676
And you came on to her.

23:58.756 --> 24:00.956
Man, why do you always assume

24:01.036 --> 24:02.516
that it's my fault?

24:02.596 --> 24:03.836
Because it always is.

24:05.396 --> 24:06.396
Well, anyway,

24:06.436 --> 24:09.156
we were both wasted--
really wasted--

24:09.196 --> 24:10.516
on the beach, and your
girl, she can drink,

24:10.596 --> 24:12.996
but she can't hold
her liquor.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.316
Look, I'm sorry, Ryan.

24:22.076 --> 24:23.276
She threw herself at me.

24:25.076 --> 24:26.196
I don't believe you.

24:26.236 --> 24:27.956
Look, she and I agreed
not to tell you,

24:28.036 --> 24:29.236
because we thought
it'd be better if
you didn't know.

24:29.316 --> 24:30.876
There's no way.

24:40.956 --> 24:42.076
You swear?

24:42.156 --> 24:44.996
On Mom.

24:47.116 --> 24:49.676
I wouldn't lie to you, Ryan.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.756
Not about this.

24:52.676 --> 24:53.636
Ryan, look...

24:53.676 --> 24:54.636
I got to go.

24:54.716 --> 24:56.156
Man, I'm so sorry. It...

25:17.756 --> 25:19.036
Marissa, hey, it's me.

25:19.116 --> 25:21.156
Um...

25:21.236 --> 25:27.396
I'm not feeling well,
so I'm not gonna make prom.

25:27.436 --> 25:28.796
Sorry.

25:35.436 --> 25:36.636
Ryan?

25:42.876 --> 25:45.076
Theresa.

25:50.385 --> 25:52.825
So what are you
doing back, huh?

25:52.905 --> 25:56.105
I'm visiting my mom
for the weekend.

25:56.145 --> 26:00.705
Believe it or not,
I miss it here.

26:00.785 --> 26:03.185
I mean, it might
not be paradise,
but it's home.

26:03.265 --> 26:05.265
And Atlanta?

26:05.305 --> 26:07.705
It's fine for now.

26:10.265 --> 26:12.665
You know, I, uh, I
wrote you all those letters.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.785
I know.

26:15.985 --> 26:18.985
I needed a clean break.

26:19.025 --> 26:20.985
Or you were mad 'cause I left.

26:21.065 --> 26:23.105
I wanted you to leave.

26:23.185 --> 26:25.545
You belong
in Newport.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.065
I mean...

26:27.145 --> 26:29.585
Which doesn't explain,
why are you back here?

26:29.665 --> 26:31.385
Trey.

26:31.465 --> 26:32.425
He's out of jail?

26:32.505 --> 26:33.425
Yeah, he was crashing with

26:33.505 --> 26:34.665
the Cohens for a little while.

26:34.745 --> 26:36.105
Everything was going good,
and then...

26:36.145 --> 26:37.225
Oh, let me guess.

26:37.265 --> 26:38.345
Trey got into trouble.

26:38.425 --> 26:40.585
He hooked up with Marissa.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.905
Trey says she came on to him.

26:44.945 --> 26:46.625
She says nothing happened.
I don't know who to believe.

26:46.705 --> 26:47.665
I do.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.745
Ryan, Trey has been jerking you
around your entire life.

26:51.825 --> 26:53.265
I mean... and Marissa.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.865
Has made mistakes.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.425
She would never hurt you
like that.

26:58.505 --> 26:59.985
How do you know?

27:00.065 --> 27:03.665
'Cause last year
when I needed you, you know,

27:03.705 --> 27:06.785
she, she let you go.

27:08.505 --> 27:11.065
Even though it broke her heart.

27:14.505 --> 27:17.865
They both love you,
but of the two of them,

27:17.905 --> 27:19.825
Marissa is the one
that you can trust.

27:25.705 --> 27:28.425
Well, this is me.

27:28.465 --> 27:30.425
Oh, is your mom in?
I'll say hey.

27:30.465 --> 27:32.585
Yeah, but, um, well,
it's getting kind of late.

27:32.665 --> 27:33.545
All right. Let me help you in.

27:33.625 --> 27:35.625
No, it's okay.
I got it.

27:35.705 --> 27:37.065
Yeah? Sure?

27:37.105 --> 27:38.185
Yeah.

27:38.905 --> 27:40.745
Okay.

27:40.785 --> 27:44.945
Talk to Marissa, you know.

27:44.985 --> 27:45.905
Make this right.

27:45.945 --> 27:47.865
Yeah, I will.

27:48.985 --> 27:50.785
Okay.

27:51.585 --> 27:52.825
Take care.

27:52.865 --> 27:54.545
Yeah.

27:54.625 --> 27:56.985
Bye.

28:02.425 --> 28:04.305
Hi!

28:04.385 --> 28:06.225
Somebody missed you.

28:06.305 --> 28:08.305
Oh, he looks more
and more

28:08.345 --> 28:09.945
like his daddy
every day.

28:32.985 --> 28:35.065
I'm glad it's you.

28:35.145 --> 28:36.945
I didn't know
what magenta was,

28:37.025 --> 28:37.985
so I got you white.

28:38.065 --> 28:39.705
Perfect.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.520
We're supposed
to get our picture taken

28:46.560 --> 28:47.600
with the mermaid.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.600
I think it's mandatory
for the yearbook.

28:48.640 --> 28:49.760
Okay, um...

28:51.280 --> 28:53.000
Just give me a second, okay?

28:53.040 --> 28:54.960
Okay.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.840
Coop.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.200
Hey.
Hey.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.040
Under the O. Sea
is awesome.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.120
Thanks.

29:04.200 --> 29:04.840
Where's Ryan?

29:04.920 --> 29:06.640
He couldn't make it.

29:06.680 --> 29:07.640
He's sick.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.760
Sick?
Too sick to take you to prom?

29:09.840 --> 29:11.720
He better be really sick--
like, dead--

29:11.800 --> 29:12.920
because if he's not,

29:12.960 --> 29:14.280
I'm gonna strangle him
with his own wifebeater.

29:14.360 --> 29:15.600
It's okay, you know?

29:15.680 --> 29:18.040
I mean, I've got
plenty to do anyway.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.200
I'll be okay.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.360
I'll have a seltzer
on the rocks

29:26.400 --> 29:27.600
with a twist of lemon.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.720
I'll have the same.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.960
Seltzer on the...
George Lucas drinks seltzer.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.360
Every-everything you do,
every little detail, to me,

29:33.440 --> 29:35.440
it's just, uh, I don't know,
it's fascinating.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.520
You're too kind.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.440
Let me ask you

29:37.520 --> 29:38.720
just one question,

29:38.760 --> 29:40.360
and then I promise
we'll get into the book.

29:40.440 --> 29:44.840
Um... how did you first come up
with the light saber?

29:46.200 --> 29:47.920
I'm sure
Mr. Lucas doesn't have time

29:47.960 --> 29:49.440
for such large-scale questions.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.680
Yeah, fine, I'll go smaller.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.000
Did you go to your prom?

29:54.040 --> 29:55.640
Prom?

29:56.480 --> 29:57.520
Oh, my God.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.040
As in prom?

29:59.120 --> 30:00.400
Just, uh, it's a personal thing,

30:00.480 --> 30:01.680
and I was kind of wondering
if you went to yours.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.200
It'd really help me out.

30:03.240 --> 30:04.680
Well, actually, I didn't.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.800
I spent my time
being creative;

30:06.880 --> 30:08.840
drawing ewoks,
Jar-Jar Binks.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.240
Good to know.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.080
If George Lucas can skip his
prom, I can skip mine.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.480
No, now,
wait a minute.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.400
I do regret not going
to my prom.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.920
Really? Because it's,
like, a seminal moment?

30:18.000 --> 30:18.920
Exactly.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.080
Mr. Lucas, I am so sorry.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.760
We can get back
to the point now.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.040
No, no, no, wait.
It'd be good for me
to talk about this.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.680
The prom
is a great American tradition.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.000
It's important
to experience

30:28.040 --> 30:29.760
the things of being a teenager

30:29.840 --> 30:31.320
when you're
a teenager.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.800
When I went off and made my
film American Graffiti,

30:32.880 --> 30:34.680
I'd never had the experience
of a prom,

30:34.720 --> 30:36.040
and I had to make
a movie about it.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.000
I felt

30:37.080 --> 30:38.320
hopelessly inadequate

30:38.360 --> 30:40.520
without having
really done it myself.

30:40.560 --> 30:44.480
Not having been
part of that pivotal
moment in teenage life,

30:44.560 --> 30:47.960
uh, I felt very
sad and alone.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.080
You're buzzing.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.120
Oh, yeah, Reed's sending me
text messages.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.480
I don't have to check them,
though.

30:54.560 --> 30:57.560
Go ahead.

30:57.640 --> 30:58.800
Okay.

31:00.560 --> 31:04.000
Oh, God, she's saying
George Lucas has checked out.

31:04.040 --> 31:08.040
God, Seth is totally
ignoring the talking points.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.880
He-he always...

31:10.960 --> 31:12.400
I-I'm sorry.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.440
It's okay.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.400
No, it's not.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.640
This is ridiculous.

31:15.720 --> 31:19.400
I'm here with you
at prom,

31:19.480 --> 31:22.280
just like I wanted.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.920
If you have to talk yourself
into this,

31:24.960 --> 31:28.440
it probably means
you shouldn't be here.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.920
I'm your date.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.800
Even though you didn't
want me to be.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.080
I did want you to be.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.080
No.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.600
You didn't.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.880
I saw your face
when I got out of the limo.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.320
And I saw yours.

31:40.360 --> 31:44.560
You want to be there, talking
about your comic book with Reed.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.040
Look, my prom fantasy,

31:47.120 --> 31:49.600
it didn't quite happen, but...

31:49.680 --> 31:53.400
you've been dreaming about
this comic book your whole life.

31:53.480 --> 31:54.520
This is your shot.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.880
You should go.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.320
I can't abandon you.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.360
I did it to you.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.600
Good point.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.960
Go.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.720
Save Cohen from himself.

32:13.120 --> 32:16.360
So, we ended up,
well, we flipped a coin.

32:16.440 --> 32:17.680
You flipped a coin?

32:17.720 --> 32:19.560
Yeah, and, you know,
I know it sounds crazy,

32:19.640 --> 32:21.040
but at the time...

32:22.160 --> 32:24.520
Will you excuse me
for one second?

32:24.600 --> 32:25.680
I'll be right back.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.040
Hey.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.320
You didn't have
to come here.

32:30.360 --> 32:32.880
Look, we need to settle
this thing once and for all.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.640
And I think
for the first time,

32:34.720 --> 32:36.640
you and I both know
where we need to be.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.000
You want the comic book.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.520
And you want Summer.

32:42.280 --> 32:43.960
All right.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.320
Now, you don't have
much time, so take this.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.160
All right.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.440
Wow, thanks, man.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.040
So, movie time.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.240
Now, Seth recommends
Shaun of the Dead.

32:58.320 --> 33:02.000
He says it's a very funny,
romantic zombie comedy.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.440
Actually,
I'm pretty wiped out.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.120
I'm gonna go soak
in a hot bath.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.560
The food's here.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.200
I'll wait then.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.520
I can take a bath later.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.280
You know what?

33:12.360 --> 33:13.480
Go ahead.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.440
We can heat the food up
when you're done.

33:15.480 --> 33:16.680
Oh, thanks.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.720
Hey.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.000
You know what?
I don't have my wallet.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.240
ng on a second.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.720
Let me grab some cash.

33:35.440 --> 33:36.400
Mm...

33:39.960 --> 33:41.640
So...

33:41.720 --> 33:45.160
You about ready for this marg?

33:45.240 --> 33:46.640
Why not?

33:48.120 --> 33:49.480
You know...

33:50.680 --> 33:52.240
I've never been
in this pool before.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.120
No, you're more of
a land shark.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.080
We should have done this

33:57.120 --> 33:59.160
sort of thing more.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.760
Enjoyed each other more.

34:00.840 --> 34:04.160
Well, we had our moments.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.600
I suppose this calls for
a toast.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.040
You know, I-I really did
love you, Juju.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.159
Ooh. Past tense.

34:14.239 --> 34:15.280
That stings.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.199
Sorry. Grammatical error.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.280
To us.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.719
Wait, stop!

34:22.760 --> 34:24.199
What?

34:24.239 --> 34:26.400
I didn't put lime
in your drink.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.719
Let me make you
a new one.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.360
There's no need.

34:36.440 --> 34:40.719
Well, looks like we're both
flying solo on prom night.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.280
Why, what happened
to Zach?

34:42.320 --> 34:45.960
Oh, he went to go
save the comic book.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.199
Are you okay?

34:47.280 --> 34:49.159
Yeah.

34:49.239 --> 34:51.960
So, prom was
a letdown.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.600
You know, but I bet
it is for everybody.

34:53.639 --> 34:55.679
It's like New Year's.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.120
Well, we could always
go back to your house.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.160
Yeah.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.560
Curl up with
Princess Sparkle,

35:00.600 --> 35:02.760
watch the season one
of The Valley on DVD.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.520
Ooh, that sounds perfect.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.520
Yeah.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.280
Come on.
All right.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.800
All right, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

35:09.880 --> 35:14.760
It's time to announce Harbor
School's prom king and queen.

35:19.520 --> 35:22.720
And your prom queen tonight...

35:22.800 --> 35:24.400
Summer Roberts.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.360
Summer, come on up here.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.320
Oh, no.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.560
Get me out of here.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.840
And your prom king...

35:28.880 --> 35:30.800
Zach Stevens.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.400
I'm making a run for it.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.240
Now, if the king and queen
could join me onstage,

35:36.280 --> 35:38.800
they'll kick off
your spotlight dance.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.640
Here's the queen.
We found her.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.960
We're halfway there.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.560
Summer Roberts, come on up here.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.800
Zach Stevens,
we're waiting.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.200
Zach Stevens,
we're waiting.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.440
No one's coming.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.080
Hey.
Cohen.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.920
Sorry I'm late.
I was caught in traffic.

36:24.960 --> 36:27.040
I'm onstage.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.520
You're not
Zach Stevens!

36:28.600 --> 36:29.520
No, I'm not.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.520
Get off
the stage, geek!

36:30.560 --> 36:31.600
I think you should
step down.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.040
You're not
the prom king.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.080
Seth Cohen's
a tool!

36:34.120 --> 36:35.200
Okay.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.960
I know I'm not
who you all imagined

36:37.000 --> 36:37.920
as prom king...

36:37.960 --> 36:39.280
seeing as how I'm not

36:39.320 --> 36:41.480
who any of you
actually voted for.

36:41.560 --> 36:45.480
But she's the queen,
and I love her.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.440
So I guess that
that makes me king.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.200
Cohen...
No, I'm just a guy
standing next to you.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.400
You're the queen,
all right?

36:52.480 --> 36:55.840
I'm the jester perhaps,
if that works.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.080
So let me ask you this,
Your Highness...

36:58.160 --> 37:00.800
What can I do
to make it up to you?

37:00.840 --> 37:04.120
Well, you...
Uh.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.600
Well...

37:05.680 --> 37:08.360
you can start
by dancing with me.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.040
Aww...

37:17.120 --> 37:19.120
But he's a tool!

37:50.640 --> 37:52.280
Marissa.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.120
Ryan.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.000
Sorry I missed prom.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.440
You're just in time.

38:49.080 --> 38:51.200
Julie...

38:53.800 --> 38:54.720
Julie!

39:05.200 --> 39:07.040
Cal?

39:08.760 --> 39:10.120
Cal!

39:25.200 --> 39:29.120
Oh, that moo shu
smells great.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.000
What are we gonna
do about you?

39:32.080 --> 39:34.720
I found your stash.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.200
It's just in case.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.400
And I trusted you.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.720
I believed you
when you said you were done.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.040
Sandy, I'm doing this
my own way.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.040
How?

39:48.120 --> 39:50.760
By sneaking around?

39:50.800 --> 39:52.000
By lying to me?

39:52.080 --> 39:53.520
I just don't want you
to baby-sit me,

39:53.600 --> 39:55.600
like I'm some wayward child.

39:55.680 --> 39:59.080
Well, maybe that's exactly
what you need.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.680
Right now, I feel
more like your dad

40:00.720 --> 40:02.440
than I feel like
your husband.

40:13.320 --> 40:14.400
Hello.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.400
What?

40:15.480 --> 40:16.840
Julie?

40:16.880 --> 40:19.280
Huh?

40:19.320 --> 40:20.760
Wait-wait-wait,
calm down.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.920
Say that again.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.960
Oh, my God.

40:29.480 --> 40:33.120
I understand.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.840
Of course.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.040
It's about your father.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.720
What is it?

40:42.800 --> 40:44.360
He's all right, isn't he?

40:51.560 --> 40:52.680
He's dead.

40:55.280 --> 40:58.520
I am so sorry.
