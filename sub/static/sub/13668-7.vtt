WEBVTT

00:02.120 --> 00:03.760
We're all over you, Carson!
We know who you are!

00:03.760 --> 00:07.600
(VOICEOVER) Previously,
on St Elsewhere.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.640
Do you have any idea why this
happened?

00:09.640 --> 00:11.560
Do you know about the
Troubles, Dr Morrison?

00:11.560 --> 00:13.000
Where did you pick up
that gorgeous brogue?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.240
Where did you pick up
that gorgeous brogue?

00:14.240 --> 00:17.320
It's simple, Doctor. We're
Protestant, and they're Catholic.

00:17.320 --> 00:20.120
Would you call this being
out of the woods?

00:20.120 --> 00:22.280
Are you kidding?
You're all the way downtown!

00:22.280 --> 00:24.720
I'm being subpoenaed by the medical
examiners' office.

00:24.720 --> 00:25.560
What for?

00:25.560 --> 00:27.080
What for?

00:27.080 --> 00:29.480
Peter White.
He's unprofessional, and unreliable.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.520
Best thing is to get him
out of this hospital.

00:31.520 --> 00:34.320
But the woman was so desperate.
I just wanted to help her.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.360
He might be like that for a while.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.480
Better not.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.480
Brennan's friends know
where Eddie is.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.360
His life is in danger right now.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.040
Ever since the transplant,

00:43.040 --> 00:47.040
just the thought of Dr Craig
makes my eyes moist.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.240
Your eyes?

00:48.240 --> 00:50.880
Either you know, or you don't know!

00:50.880 --> 00:52.520
Well, I know she's eccentric.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.520
Dr Craig, this package is for you.

00:57.280 --> 01:01.280
Don't touch it, it's ticking.

02:42.040 --> 02:45.520
# As I walked out in
The streets of Laredo &gt;

02:45.520 --> 02:49.520
# As I walked out
In Laredo one day &gt;

02:49.760 --> 02:53.400
# I saw a young cowboy
All dressed in white linen

02:53.400 --> 02:57.280
# Dressed in white linen... #.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.200
I just couldn't take a chance.

02:59.200 --> 03:02.520
Well, you did right bringing her in
here. How are you feeling now?

03:02.520 --> 03:04.320
I was changing
the batteries on my camera.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.880
I didn't see her swallow one,
but then she woke up screaming.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.920
This was around eight o'clock?

03:07.920 --> 03:10.320
I looked everywhere for it.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.840
Well, they're not in here.

03:12.840 --> 03:14.840
Something like that would
definitely show up.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.200
The stomach ache could be
just something she ate,

03:17.200 --> 03:18.960
or maybe she's got
a touch of the flu bug.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.720
Everything is going to be fine.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.600
Can I ask you a favour, Doctor?

03:24.600 --> 03:26.160
We just moved here from Gloucester.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.880
Better keep an eye on her. She may
be coming down with something.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.200
I don't know how we'll manage.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.800
I work nights, and I try
to sleep days.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.120
The problem is there's a car wash
right out the window.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.160
Just the two of you?

03:35.160 --> 03:38.480
I hate to ask you for a refill,
but God knows how else I'll get it.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.480
That's the pharmacy in Gloucester,

03:40.480 --> 03:43.720
and the label with
my doctor's name on.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.680
Well, the hospital pharmacy's
closed right now. Seconal?

03:46.680 --> 03:49.600
If I don't get some sleep,
at least this weekend.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.720
Seconal's overdoing it,
don't you think?

03:51.720 --> 03:54.120
I'm allergic to most of the others.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.800
Believe me, Mrs Russ,
drugs will not solve your problems.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.120
I've got one problem, Doctor.
Sleeping.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.480
Once I get that under control,

04:01.480 --> 04:05.480
everything else'll
take care of itself.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.400
Just a minute.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.560
What have you got?

04:11.560 --> 04:13.240
Someone tried to set this
guy on fire.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.680
Smells like gasoline.

04:14.680 --> 04:17.040
Just hop onto here, sir.

04:17.040 --> 04:20.040
Let's soak him in ice,
betadine and saline.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.440
Hand's not going to keep.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.960
Do you have Caldwell's home number?

04:22.960 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, I'll give him a call.
OK.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.960
Shirley, would you open the cabinet,
please?

04:26.960 --> 04:27.840
Peter, we've got this patient.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.040
Peter, we've got this patient.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.160
Can it wait a second?  No.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.040
Shirley, would you step on it?

04:31.040 --> 04:35.040
Shirley, would you step on it?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.880
Got your teddy?

04:49.880 --> 04:51.120
We'll be home soon.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.440
Know what I'm going to give you?

04:53.440 --> 04:57.440
I'm going to give you
a big lollipop.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.520
I've got a girl your age at home.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.520
In fact, we're having a party
tomorrow, a birthday party.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.920
All right,
there are six of them in here.

05:07.920 --> 05:08.960
Enough to tide you over,

05:08.960 --> 05:11.680
but tomorrow I want you to call the
family practice clinic

05:11.680 --> 05:14.000
and make an appointment. All right?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I really appreciate this, Doctor.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.920
OK. Bye-bye.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.920
Bye.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.440
I honestly don't see any sign

05:34.440 --> 05:37.160
of a neurological deficit
in Mr Tokugawa's case.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.080
Do you think I should buy this book?

05:39.080 --> 05:41.880
Where Am I Going?
What is it, a travel guide?

05:41.880 --> 05:43.680
No, it's a self-help character
analysis.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.440
Well, Penning wants a lumbar
puncture.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.480
Victor?

05:46.480 --> 05:49.160
To rule out the possibility
of encephalitis and meningitis.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.000
I think he's just churning
the patient.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
He's one of our senior attendings.
Please don't talk about him that way.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.800
I was wondering if you could give me
some advice, Doctor.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.920
Medical, personal, or ethereal?

05:58.920 --> 06:01.600
I've had this odd vision.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.360
You want to give Pinning a call?

06:03.360 --> 06:06.360
I don't know his number.

06:06.360 --> 06:10.360
Fine. Come on.

06:12.280 --> 06:16.280
Come here.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.360
I guess you must know Dr Craig
just about as well as anyone.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.560
There's always his wife.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.680
And that you have at least some
understanding of the inner man.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.640
The man is a mystery
wrapped in an enigma, OK?

06:29.640 --> 06:32.680
Why do you suddenly want to know
so much about Dr Craig?

06:32.680 --> 06:35.160
Can't you tell, Victor?

06:35.160 --> 06:37.560
I'm in love with him.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.720
Run that by me again.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.160
I can hardly verbalise it.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.920
But ever since the transplant,

06:42.920 --> 06:46.920
just the thought of Dr Craig
makes my eyes moist.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.680
Your eyes?

06:48.680 --> 06:49.800
Yes.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.800
I can hear my own heart beat,

06:51.800 --> 06:55.800
and I realise I have to find
a way to syncopate our rhythms.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.320
What can I do?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.120
Gifts are always nice.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.560
That's it!

07:05.560 --> 07:09.560
I'll shower him
with affection from afar.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.520
Thanks, Victor.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.320
I knew I could count on you.

07:17.320 --> 07:21.320
Oh, I'm dead meat.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.760
You Patrick Brennan's doctor?

07:45.760 --> 07:47.000
Uh-huh.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.760
Can you tell me how he is?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.240
You a relative?

07:50.240 --> 07:54.240
No, his best friend, Hugh Crotty.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.600
I'm Dr Morrison.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.440
Is he any better?

08:00.440 --> 08:02.000
Well, it's only been a few days.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
There really hasn't been
much change.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.400
It's going to take some time.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.560
Does that thing hurt?

08:12.560 --> 08:16.560
No.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.200
Pat's real tough, you know.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.040
Saw him take down four
guys at once last summer.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.200
Yeah, he's tough, all right.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.800
That has a lot to do with why
he's still alive.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.040
You watch. He'll be out
of here before you think.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.200
Hugh.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.840
He might be in that
coma for a long time.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.679
Better not.

08:36.679 --> 08:40.679
For everybody's sake.

08:40.919 --> 08:44.920
Hello, Jack.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.000
Eve, you know the rules.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.960
Oh, come on, for heaven's sake.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.240
You're wounded.
I don't want you walking back.

08:54.240 --> 08:57.120
If Dr Craig catches you,
we'll all need a wheelchair.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.160
What are you doing out here, anyway?

08:59.160 --> 09:01.600
I was on my way to the gift shop
to buy a toothbrush.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.600
I'll get somebody to bring you one.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.160
Donald.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.120
Donald.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.160
Donald.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.120
Better, thanks.
Improves my disposition, I hope.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.000
You know, Donald, I've been
thinking about what you said.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.320
I probably have been sliding
the other patients, to some degree.

09:20.320 --> 09:24.320
But you could have been
nicer about it.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.120
You want to know how fast
bad news travels?

09:28.120 --> 09:30.120
Arnold Kleven just called.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.240
Who?

09:31.240 --> 09:34.080
That contemptible ferret down
at the board of medical examiners.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.920
He couldn't wait to tell me that
someone at St Eligius is about to be

09:36.920 --> 09:38.120
brought up on charges

09:38.120 --> 09:40.920
for the improper dispensing
of controlled drugs.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.400
What?

09:42.400 --> 09:44.640
Can you believe it?
Earlier this morning,

09:44.640 --> 09:47.360
one of our residents was
snookered by an undercover agent.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.800
Oh, no. Who is it?

09:48.800 --> 09:51.080
Peter White.
He's unprofessional and unreliable.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.200
The best thing is to get him
out of this hospital.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.800
Aren't you jumping to conclusions?

09:54.800 --> 09:56.760
Oh, White did it, all right.
Arnold tells me

09:56.760 --> 09:58.440
he got the whole thing on tape.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.840
Did Arnold say
anything about a hearing?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.320
Of course. You watch.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.240
There'll be an avalanche
of publicity.

10:04.240 --> 10:08.040
This entire institution will
get a black eye.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.560
That agent certainly didn't waste
any time reporting it.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.120
Ten o'clock in the morning,
the day's already in the toilet.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.560
But if we get rid of White now,

10:14.560 --> 10:16.720
at least the hospital won't
go on trial with him.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.440
Mark, I'm not going to do anything
until I get an official call.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.200
Well, you've got to
have a game plan.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.560
A strategy. These guys are vipers.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.200
I don't get it.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.960
On whose authority do the examiners

10:28.960 --> 10:30.880
send undercover agents
into this hospital?

10:30.880 --> 10:33.880
White's problems aren't exactly
a secret, Donald.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.920
Maybe not here,
but how did they know?

10:35.920 --> 10:39.920
They didn't. Apparently,
he was targeted at random.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.040
Are you telling me
they're doing this routinely?

10:43.040 --> 10:45.560
BUZZER

10:45.560 --> 10:47.960
Yes, Elisa?

10:47.960 --> 10:50.880
Put it through.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.160
Hello, Arnold.

10:52.160 --> 10:56.160
I hate that man.

11:13.040 --> 11:17.040
Howdy.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.440
You are really letting me down,
Eddie, my boy.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.320
Lost six pounds
since you've been here.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.360
Yes, sir.
I can feel the difference.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.560
If you don't eat,
you're not going to get any better.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.600
It hurts to chew.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.600
Well, then we'll order up some
protein shakes.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.280
Yeah. The periorbital area
looks great.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.440
That black eye, a couple of weeks,
that'll be gone.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.480
The scar's the least of it, sir.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.480
Can you tell me when
I'll be getting out of here?

11:51.480 --> 11:54.920
Well, I'd like to see that cheek
heal up a little better first.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.000
You thinking about going
back to Ireland?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.120
No, sir.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.280
You know, Eddie.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.440
In this country, if you don't want
to talk to a cop, you don't have to.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.560
You can always ask to see
an attorney.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.760
Not me.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.880
Yeah, but here, lawyers are...

12:08.880 --> 12:12.680
Yeah, but here, lawyers are...

12:12.680 --> 12:15.560
OK.

12:15.560 --> 12:19.560
Later.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.520
Chuck's bringing the kids
back in a few minutes, Peter.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.960
OK, honey.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.280
Aha!
Found the birthday candles.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.320
Got the lemonade?

12:28.320 --> 12:30.280
Yeah.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.240
Hey, why don't you hang some more
streamers above the table?

12:33.240 --> 12:35.640
All right, all right.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.960
I hope Megan likes her
catcher's mitt.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.440
She's only four years old, Peter.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.040
Yeah, but she's got a great arm.

12:42.040 --> 12:46.000
PHONE RINGS

12:46.000 --> 12:47.560
Hello?

12:47.560 --> 12:49.480
Hi, Dr Westphall.

12:49.480 --> 12:53.480
Uh-huh, just fine, thanks.
Peter's right here.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.640
Good morning.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.680
No, no problem.

13:00.680 --> 13:04.680
We're just getting things ready for
Megan's birthday party over here.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.680
What?

13:10.680 --> 13:13.680
I don't believe that.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.920
No.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.080
I'm scheduled to come in
about one o'clock.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.440
I could meet you earlier
if you need me to.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.880
Yeah, OK, I'll meet you there.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.880
I appreciate you calling.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
What's wrong?

13:35.840 --> 13:38.640
I'm being subpoenaed by
the Medical Examiners Office.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.640
What for?

13:44.800 --> 13:48.800
I don't believe this.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.240
Oh! I'm sorry, really.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.320
Michael, you got a minute?

13:54.320 --> 13:56.320
Sure, what's up?

13:56.320 --> 13:58.840
I'd like you to have a talk
with a post-op patient of mine.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.600
Kid by the name of Eddie Carson.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.720
He's depressed, losing weight.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.160
He's a little kid?

14:04.160 --> 14:06.520
He's 15. Traffic accident.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.040
I pulled out a periorbital fracture
with no problem at all,

14:09.040 --> 14:11.440
but the skin graft on his cheek
didn't completely take.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.480
He's scarred?

14:12.480 --> 14:14.200
Yeah, and refuses to deal with it.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.480
I mean, I'm doing all I can for him,
medically, but he needs your help.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.720
I'd be glad to see him.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.800
White was on the ball, medically,
that night, I can tell you that.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.240
These undercover people can be
very deceptive.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.800
An old classmate of mine from
Berkeley got targeted last year.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.320
They carted him away in handcuffs.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.360
There must have been a good
reason for it.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.600
Tuinal for a chronic pain patient,

14:32.600 --> 14:35.080
and he's pretty sure it was
another doctor who set him up.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.480
That's absolutely ridiculous.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.640
Oh, you know the case?

14:37.640 --> 14:39.200
I know human nature.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.480
In other words,
where there's smoke, there's fire.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.520
Some guy gets accused of something,
that automatically means he did it?

14:44.520 --> 14:46.040
Usually.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.080
Ever heard of the Constitution?

14:47.080 --> 14:48.920
Ever heard of the Constitution?

14:48.920 --> 14:51.480
Well, it's in one of those
amendments somewhere.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.600
The point is that we're all
guaranteed &gt;

14:53.600 --> 14:55.160
the presumption of innocence.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.720
Is there going to be a hearing?

14:56.720 --> 14:57.760
You said it, Shirl.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.440
There'll be a public flogging
with pillories and everything,

15:00.440 --> 15:04.440
and we get to throw fruit.

15:09.600 --> 15:13.200
Dr Craig? This package is for you.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.240
Don't touch it.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.040
It's ticking.

15:17.040 --> 15:20.800
PACKAGE TICKS

15:20.800 --> 15:22.200
It's definitely ticking.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.760
Could be a metronome
or an egg timer.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.080
Could be an artificial heart.

15:25.080 --> 15:25.960
Or a bomb.

15:25.960 --> 15:26.760
Or a bomb.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.920
Or a bomb.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.160
I get phone calls, strange letters,
my car has been tampered with.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.960
Are you going to open it?

15:32.960 --> 15:36.960
Well, it's addressed to me, isn't it?

15:48.200 --> 15:51.160
Why would anyone send me a clock?

15:51.160 --> 15:52.760
Erm, erm.

15:52.760 --> 15:55.600
"Time does not stand still
for hearts that beat together.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.920
"With love from the woman who
waits for our next encounter."

15:58.920 --> 16:00.080
Your next encounter?

16:00.080 --> 16:01.240
Crackpot.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.120
Who is this?

16:02.120 --> 16:03.320
Who is this?

16:03.320 --> 16:04.720
Maybe it's from your wife.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.880
Uh-uh. Ellen's digital all the way.

16:06.880 --> 16:10.560
I don't know. This is a pretty
intimate note from a total stranger.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.840
Are you holding something
back from us?

16:12.840 --> 16:15.760
&lt; Woman's obviously a lunatic.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.080
I'm going to find out who it is

16:17.080 --> 16:21.080
and put a stop to this
nonsense right away.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.120
I didn't know Mark was a player.

16:27.120 --> 16:31.120
I had a run-in with the medical
examiners myself, years ago.

16:31.760 --> 16:35.360
The patient was a 63-year-old
Jehovah's Witness.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.120
Very sick man, totally dehydrated.

16:38.120 --> 16:42.000
Anyway, he claimed that
I medicated him without his consent.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.440
0.45 saline and glucose
intravenously.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.560
Were you facing five
years of probation?

16:47.560 --> 16:49.240
No. This was in the old days.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.400
Then I don't think
it's quite the same.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.200
I'd be better off if I was a junkie.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.880
Have you given any thought
to your defence?

16:57.880 --> 16:59.760
What defence?

16:59.760 --> 17:03.760
Dr Westphall, I gave
the woman the pills.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.599
What I want to know is what
sort of person would take

17:08.599 --> 17:11.440
advantage of her own daughter in
order to pull off a stunt like this.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.720
I don't know.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.599
But that isn't the issue here,
is it?

17:16.599 --> 17:19.119
No.

17:19.119 --> 17:22.760
You know,
I keep going over the whole thing.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.960
I knew it was stupid.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.359
Dangerous.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.080
But the woman was so desperate.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.640
I just wanted to help her.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.160
Now, what does that
say about my clinical judgement?

17:34.160 --> 17:35.520
About my common sense?

17:35.520 --> 17:38.320
What kind of a doctor would do that?

17:38.320 --> 17:40.320
A very tired doctor.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.400
A doctor with some sensitivity
and compassion.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.400
A doctor who doesn't trust
anybody any more.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.720
Peter, I'm having a meeting this
afternoon with Joan Halloran.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.600
We'll straighten this thing out.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.600
Thank you. I appreciate it.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.360
Afternoon, Eve.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.280
You're wasting your time
around here, Mark.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.040
Everything's just hunky-dory.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.480
Well, that's good to hear.

18:14.480 --> 18:18.480
You've been doing those isometrics
I showed you? Let me see that.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.280
Not bad.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.040
Mark, I'm getting bedsores.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.240
You know, what I'd really like
to do is take a nice,

18:24.240 --> 18:26.800
long walk around the block.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.880
It won't be long.

18:27.880 --> 18:31.880
And I'm not drinking any more
of that homogenised chalk dust.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.480
You've been asked for an interview
by Boston Week magazine.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.120
That sounds like an interesting idea.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.360
Why don't you do it?

18:41.360 --> 18:45.360
They want the transplant
from your perspective.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.840
You should be able to
talk about that.

18:48.840 --> 18:49.880
Tell them how you feel.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.880
I feel like hell.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.560
Sure, I'll talk to them.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.840
I'll tell them
we probably should have let me die.

18:58.840 --> 19:00.480
Eve.

19:00.480 --> 19:04.480
I mean it.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.000
I want you to listen to something.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.040
It turns out the woman was wired.

19:09.040 --> 19:13.040
She's a plainclothes
investigator for the state police.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.520
'I hate to ask you for a refill,
but God knows how else I'll get it.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.280
'That's the pharmacy in Gloucester,

19:19.280 --> 19:21.160
'and the label
with my doctor's name on.'

19:21.160 --> 19:23.720
I've heard it already.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.400
This isn't Watergate, Donald.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.880
There's nothing there.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.520
Just listen to this last part.

19:29.520 --> 19:32.200
'Believe me, Mrs Russ,
drugs will not solve your problems.'

19:32.200 --> 19:34.680
'I've got one problem, Doctor.
Sleeping.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.800
'And once I get that under control,

19:36.800 --> 19:39.840
'everything else will take
care of itself.'

19:39.840 --> 19:41.760
Entrapment, pure and simple.

19:41.760 --> 19:45.320
Illicitly dispensing controlled
drugs is a real problem.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.840
Sure it is.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.840
But this agent was preying on
Peter White's sense of compassion.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.960
There are a small number of lousy
doctors out there who hand out

19:52.960 --> 19:56.480
unprescribed drugs like candy,
and I personally can't think

19:56.480 --> 19:59.280
of any other investigative technique
that can solve the problem.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.680
This woman isn't looking
to correct abuses,

20:01.680 --> 20:03.680
she's looking for a scalp,
or a promotion.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.160
Or a bigger budget for her little
bureau she works in.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.560
Donald,
he prescribed without pathology.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.600
He failed to perform a good
faith examination.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.840
He dispensed a class three drug
without a proper label.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.320
She lied to him.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.680
The board has a clear mandate
from the legislature

20:18.680 --> 20:20.080
to do something about drugs.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.680
It's a highly political situation.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.720
BUZZER

20:24.720 --> 20:25.800
Yeah.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.920
'Sorry, but I've got
Senator Valman on line four.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.800
'He says it's urgent.'

20:30.800 --> 20:32.800
You knocked on the right door,
that's for sure.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.520
Yeah.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.440
Yeah.

20:36.440 --> 20:40.440
both of us are wasting our time.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.800
&lt; Hello, Senator.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.560
&lt; No, I haven't had a chance to
talk to the Mayor yet.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.120
I miss the milk more than anything,
I guess.

20:48.120 --> 20:51.240
The pastureland is so rich and green
over there you can taste the milk

20:51.240 --> 20:54.960
and tell which county it comes from.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.120
What happened after you
moved to the city?

20:58.120 --> 20:59.920
Nothing.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.920
Belfast is very beautiful.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.280
That's nice. Where's that?

21:12.280 --> 21:13.760
Just round at Glen Bay.

21:13.760 --> 21:17.080
I used to go there every summer.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.960
Are you in a lot of pain, Eddie?

21:19.960 --> 21:23.200
I can live with it.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.760
I had an accident myself,
when I was a kid.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.560
It was a bicycle accident.

21:27.560 --> 21:31.200
Of course,
it wasn't nearly as bad as yours.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.440
Did you get scars?

21:33.440 --> 21:37.440
Yeah, I did. Right on my leg.
It went...

21:38.360 --> 21:42.360
I remember, I wouldn't wear
a bathing suit for the longest time.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.160
I guess that's pretty stupid, huh?

21:47.560 --> 21:51.080
At least I could always
wear a ski mask.

21:51.080 --> 21:55.080
I was so angry at myself,
because I knew that it was my fault.

22:00.480 --> 22:03.120
We always had bikes
when we lived in the country.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.640
We'd go all over,
me and my brothers.

22:05.640 --> 22:09.640
Nettle trails,
the hills around Lough Erne.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.800
You needed a bike with fat tyres.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.800
Are they in Ireland?

22:14.800 --> 22:16.080
Who?

22:16.080 --> 22:20.080
Your brothers.

22:20.560 --> 22:24.560
My brothers are both dead.

22:24.960 --> 22:28.120
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.480
How did it happen?

22:31.480 --> 22:35.480
Pneumonia, one of them.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.560
I don't want to miss dinner.

22:38.560 --> 22:42.560
What are you doing?
It's only 4.30.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.440
My aunt's bringing in some
home cooking.

22:45.440 --> 22:49.440
They've got a little pub
a couple of streets from here.

22:51.760 --> 22:55.760
Eddie, call me up, OK, any time you
want to talk, or anything.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.800
My only real concern here is the
proximity of the lesion to the vein.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.320
We could be in real trouble
if there's vascular invasion.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.600
(LAUGHS)

23:18.600 --> 23:20.480
I take it you know
something about this?

23:20.480 --> 23:21.680
No, sir, nothing.

23:21.680 --> 23:23.680
I was just wondering
how it survived the prep.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.440
I get calls in the middle
of the night, I get an antique clock.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.760
It must be indelible.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.280
Never mind, we'll cut through it.
The person's dangerous.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.600
Whoever did this broke through
hospital security!

23:32.600 --> 23:34.560
I wouldn't say dangerous.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.320
What makes you say that?

23:36.320 --> 23:38.880
What I meant is,
not necessarily dangerous.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.680
Who? You know, don't you?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.360
Not really.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.920
Either you know, or you don't know.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.880
Well, I know she's eccentric.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.480
You're eccentric, Ehrlich.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.640
This person is certifiably insane.

23:50.640 --> 23:51.960
There's a subtle difference.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.400
But she's a resident.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.000
Good, now we're getting someplace.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.440
A very eccentric female resident.

23:57.440 --> 24:01.440
Dr Craig, it would be betraying
a trust if I said any more.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.520
Ehrlich, take a good look at the OR.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.160
It'll be the last one you ever see

24:05.160 --> 24:07.480
unless you give me
her full name, stat!

24:07.480 --> 24:09.960
Cathy Martin.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.480
That wacko in pathology?

24:11.480 --> 24:13.360
Frankly, sir, I'm envious.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.800
I've wanted to get to know her
better for a long time.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.440
Ehrlich, the woman is a turnip.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.640
Well, my mother always said to
chew my vegetables!

24:21.640 --> 24:23.600
You're a pig, Ehrlich.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.160
Yes, sir.

24:25.160 --> 24:29.160
Scalpel.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
POP MUSIC PLAYS

24:42.920 --> 24:44.040
Can I get you something?

24:44.040 --> 24:47.960
Sure can. Let's see. Food.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.280
What can you recommend?

24:49.280 --> 24:51.680
You can't do any better
than my husband's beef stew.

24:51.680 --> 24:54.880
Sounds perfect.
Beef stew and coffee.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.280
Separate bowls, all right?

24:56.280 --> 24:58.240
Bowl of stew and a cup of coffee.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.400
Coming up.

25:00.400 --> 25:04.080
My name is Dr Michael Ridley
from St Eligius.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.080
I work with Dr Caldwell.

25:06.080 --> 25:10.080
I met with your nephew this
afternoon, Eddie Carson.

25:11.120 --> 25:15.120
Why don't we sit down?

25:22.760 --> 25:24.920
Are you a surgeon?

25:24.920 --> 25:27.920
Oh, Gareth,
this is Dr Ridley from St Eligius.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.280
He had a talk with Eddie.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.320
How are you?

25:30.320 --> 25:34.000
Hello. I work with children
and adolescents.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.720
Eddie is a great guy.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.160
He's got a hard road ahead of him.

25:37.160 --> 25:41.160
You see, I first met with Eddie
at the request of Dr Caldwell.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.520
He was worried because Eddie
was losing so much weight

25:43.520 --> 25:47.200
and not healing as rapidly
as we had hoped he would.

25:47.200 --> 25:51.200
But what worries me is that Eddie
keeps so much bottled up inside,

25:51.240 --> 25:52.520
and that's dangerous.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.240
But he's a quiet boy.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.760
But he's a quiet boy.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.680
We may as well talk plainly, Alice.

25:57.680 --> 26:01.040
But you have to swear, Doctor, that
whatever we say stays between us.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.440
Absolutely.

26:03.440 --> 26:07.440
Now, the police are pretty sure
that Eddie ran that car

26:09.160 --> 26:11.680
over Patrick Brennan on purpose.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.760
He did it in self defence. They've
been after him since he got here.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.920
Why?

26:16.920 --> 26:18.720
Because there are some people
who believe

26:18.720 --> 26:21.160
that you can't be Irish
and Protestant.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.960
Brennan's one of those
Irish-American kids who's frustrated

26:23.960 --> 26:27.040
because he's not over there fighting
for the unification of Ireland.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.160
He and his friends do
things like raising money

26:29.160 --> 26:31.320
and sending it over to
the IRA to buy guns.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.760
I see, I see.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.640
Now, what I'm mostly confused
about is what happened

26:36.640 --> 26:38.480
when Eddie left County...?

26:38.480 --> 26:39.520
Fermanagh. &gt;

26:39.520 --> 26:41.360
And moved up to Belfast.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.960
My sister got remarried to
a terrible choice of a man.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.080
An iron worker at Harland and Wolff.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.160
A real militant Ulsterman. &gt;

26:49.160 --> 26:51.120
Eddie and his brothers
became disciples. &gt;

26:51.120 --> 26:54.200
They went to all the parades
and protest demonstrations.

26:54.200 --> 26:57.280
They fought against the Catholic
boys at the drop of a hat.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.160
They even learnt how to make
petrol bombs.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.480
Gareth!

27:00.480 --> 27:04.480
Keeping it secret isn't going to
help Eddie any more.

27:05.080 --> 27:08.680
Last November, he dropped
one in front of a bus station.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.840
He killed the three IRA guys
he was after.

27:11.840 --> 27:15.160
Two innocent bystanders
were also killed.

27:15.160 --> 27:18.360
Believe me, Dr Ridley, Eddie never
anticipated that that would happen.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.840
He's trying to get
away from all that now.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.280
You have to tell the police.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.000
But if we do,
they'll send Eddie back to Ireland,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.520
and he's bound to be killed.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.080
Look, as soon as he gets well,
we'll get him out of Boston.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.360
Listen to me.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.640
Brennan's friends
know where Eddie is.

27:32.640 --> 27:36.640
His life is in danger right now.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.800
Entrapment isn't what
you think, Donald. &gt;

27:46.800 --> 27:49.800
Legally speaking,
Peter White was not entrapped. &gt;

27:49.800 --> 27:51.120
All they have to do is prove &gt;

27:51.120 --> 27:53.960
that he had a predisposition
to commit the offence. &gt;

27:53.960 --> 27:56.400
Towel, please.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.920
And with his record of drug abuse,
that's a cinch.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.960
All right,
what about due process of law?

28:00.960 --> 28:04.000
Now, he did study some radiology
at med school, and I'm thinking

28:04.000 --> 28:06.880
if we took him out of the ER,
maybe we can ride this thing out.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.240
I think it's a terrible mistake

28:08.240 --> 28:10.360
to let them determine
how we staff this hospital.

28:10.360 --> 28:11.920
Now, Donald.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.400
I know, I said I wasn't going
to let things get to me.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.520
I know, I said I wasn't going
to let things get to me.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.240
Well, this is totally unfair.

28:16.240 --> 28:19.640
They destroy any respect for the law
people may have by trying to

28:19.640 --> 28:21.600
enforce it with lies and deceptions.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.720
If they infiltrate this
hospital with spies

28:24.720 --> 28:28.720
and phoney patients, none of us
will feel free to do our work.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.640
I got a legal
opinion from Sam Hendricks.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.960
His advice is that we get
rid of White immediately.

28:34.960 --> 28:35.680
Drink?

28:35.680 --> 28:38.680
Drink?

28:38.680 --> 28:42.680
You know, three months ago, I would
have canned Peter White in a second.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.200
He was certainly a missile, right?

28:44.200 --> 28:46.840
He was, but it's amazing the way
he's turned himself around.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.800
We have to give him credit for that.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.200
I've been working with him
very closely this last month,

28:51.200 --> 28:53.440
and I'll tell you, his diagnostic
skills sometimes,

28:53.440 --> 28:54.840
Daniel, are really remarkable.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.480
Even so,
his history can't be ignored.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.560
Why should that be
a noose around his neck?

28:59.560 --> 29:02.160
Why does everyone want to
get rid of him?

29:02.160 --> 29:05.240
How much penance does a man have to
do before he's forgiven?

29:05.240 --> 29:08.000
Good question.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
For Pete's sake, there's got to be
something we can do for him.

29:13.280 --> 29:17.280
Concerned about Eve's apparently
deteriorating emotional state.

29:19.560 --> 29:23.560
Seems on the edge of a severe
post-operative depression.

29:24.520 --> 29:28.080
Trying to figure out something that
will snap her out of it.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.800
KNOCK AT DOOR

29:29.800 --> 29:33.480
What?

29:33.480 --> 29:35.600
I got your message on my beeper.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.640
It wasn't a message.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.400
It was an expression
of genuine annoyance.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.000
How did you find out?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.120
Ehrlich told me.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.960
Of course. He was supposed to.
He was my pawn.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.600
I called you in here to tell you

29:49.600 --> 29:52.840
that this asinine little game
has got to stop.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.760
Haven't you ever had the feeling
that you're bonded with

29:55.760 --> 29:57.520
another person?

29:57.520 --> 30:00.120
Even though you've barely met,
that certain features of that

30:00.120 --> 30:04.120
other person's mind and body
are known to you in advance.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.040
Never.

30:06.040 --> 30:10.040
There's a reason this moment has
come for us, Dr Craig,

30:10.160 --> 30:13.640
and it has to do with the first real
boyfriend I ever had.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.240
His name was Mark, also,

30:16.240 --> 30:19.360
and he is now a dental
hygienist in Kansas City.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.720
I don't want to hear about this.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.160
But you have to.

30:22.160 --> 30:25.640
Mark and I were made for each
other in every way,

30:25.640 --> 30:29.640
but six weeks later, he introduced
me to his boyfriend, Squirt.

30:30.440 --> 30:33.200
I swore that I would find the one
other person on this earth

30:33.200 --> 30:35.600
that was just like him.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.600
Except, of course, for that one,
unfortunate characteristic.

30:38.600 --> 30:42.600
And you think it's me?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.960
Unless you're...

30:44.960 --> 30:47.080
Touch me again, I'll break your arm.

30:47.080 --> 30:50.240
My other Mark used to talk to me
that way.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.720
Did he ever tell you to get
out of his office?

30:52.720 --> 30:56.720
I know this kind of thing takes
time, Mark, but I'll help you.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.240
And, gradually,
you'll see our destinies will merge,

31:00.240 --> 31:02.720
like Hepburn and Tracy.

31:02.720 --> 31:06.720
Lady, the medical profession has no
room for these kind of shenanigans.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.720
It smacks of unethical behaviour.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.720
And, frankly, you're not even
my type. Now get out.

31:13.720 --> 31:17.720
I'll go for now, but I'll be back.

31:28.080 --> 31:32.080
She'll be here.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.520
Thanks. Hello, Miss Hadley.

31:39.520 --> 31:40.800
Joyce, please.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.920
Thank you for agreeing to see me.
It's my first exclusive.

31:43.920 --> 31:47.920
Mine too.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.560
This is Bob Collins, our
photographer.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.520
Nobody said anything about pictures.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.320
If I'd known,
I would have got my hair done.

31:57.320 --> 32:00.560
It's just a couple of candid shots,
while we talk.

32:00.560 --> 32:04.480
Frankly, I can't imagine anyone
being interested

32:04.480 --> 32:06.120
in what I have to say.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.920
I'm just a middle-aged
schoolteacher.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.040
People care what celebrities think.

32:10.040 --> 32:12.320
You mean Brooke Shields.

32:12.320 --> 32:15.560
Well, let's start with an easy one.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.000
How do you feel?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.920
Is that an easy one?

32:18.920 --> 32:21.440
Like I want to go home.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.000
No, seriously.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.480
I'm being serious.

32:25.480 --> 32:28.440
OK.

32:28.440 --> 32:32.440
Are you conscious of the new heart?
Do you feel any difference inside?

32:34.520 --> 32:37.160
It hurts a little.
They tell me that's normal.

32:37.160 --> 32:41.160
No, I meant are you aware of any
difference in your emotional make-up?

32:41.720 --> 32:43.600
I don't get you.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.320
Deep inside. The way you feel.

32:46.320 --> 32:50.320
I wasn't aware that Boston Week
was a religious magazine.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.600
Do you think the transplant will
affect your home situation?

32:57.600 --> 32:59.320
No, I don't. Look, does he
have to keep doing that?

32:59.320 --> 33:01.920
No, I don't. Look, does he
have to keep doing that?

33:01.920 --> 33:05.920
Maybe I'll skip ahead here.

33:06.520 --> 33:10.520
Do you regret having the transplant?

33:10.600 --> 33:14.600
If I didn't have it, I'd be dead,
and I'd regret that a lot more.

33:15.160 --> 33:19.080
Are you worried that people
may see you as a freak?

33:19.080 --> 33:21.640
I am a freak.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.880
Look, if you've got one more
question, please ask it.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.080
I'm getting tired.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.280
OK.

33:27.280 --> 33:31.280
One more, one more question.

33:32.520 --> 33:36.520
According to our source,
your operation cost ¤110,000.

33:37.560 --> 33:41.560
Was it worth it?

33:42.320 --> 33:44.760
Not today.

33:44.760 --> 33:48.760
This was a bad idea.

33:51.720 --> 33:55.120
One, two, three, four, five.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.800
One, two, three, four, five.

33:58.800 --> 34:02.360
One, two, three, four, five.

34:02.360 --> 34:05.400
One, two, three, four, five.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.320
Another amp of bicarb, stat.

34:07.320 --> 34:09.800
Check. It's been 45 minutes.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.159
There's no pulse,
no response to anything.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.520
..four, five.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.520
One, two, three, four, five.

34:28.520 --> 34:31.560
&lt; It's over.

34:31.560 --> 34:35.560
We did all we could.

34:36.360 --> 34:40.360
I'm surprised he lived this long.

34:41.120 --> 34:45.120
I'll sign the death certificate. &gt;

35:00.440 --> 35:02.120
I'm sorry.

35:02.120 --> 35:06.120
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.560
I have to call his mother.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.120
Tell her her son was murdered.

35:11.120 --> 35:15.120
And go and tell Carson
he's running out of time.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.840
She's writing me little notes,
sending me gifts.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.560
I like the clock. &gt;

35:28.560 --> 35:31.320
That's beside the point. This kind of
nonsense makes me nervous.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.040
She sounds like quite a handful.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.160
She's nuts.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.920
She's young.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.640
You were pretty insatiable
yourself at age 28.

35:38.640 --> 35:41.280
That's different. I'm a man.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.520
This whole thing is
disturbing to me, Ellen.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.080
Don't you understand?

35:45.080 --> 35:46.840
She thinks I'm somebody else.

35:46.840 --> 35:50.560
Keeps babbling about some bisexual
dental assistant from Oklahoma City.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.880
Kansas City.

35:51.880 --> 35:55.880
Well, wherever the hell he's from.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.120
You're embarrassed.

36:01.120 --> 36:03.680
I'm a surgeon, not a sex object.

36:03.680 --> 36:05.600
Uh-huh? To me, you are.

36:05.600 --> 36:09.120
Oh, for crying out loud, Ellen.
We're in the kitchen.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.840
Well, I remember when we christened
every room in the house.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.280
Yeah, sure.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.080
Well, that was a long time ago.

36:15.080 --> 36:19.000
Will you concentrate on today
and tell me what do?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.800
I'm having lunch near the hospital.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.040
I could stop by and have a little
chat with her, woman to woman.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.160
I don't know.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.840
Might help, you never know.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.560
Actually, I'd really appreciate that.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.600
Don't worry about it.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.800
Tell her anything.
Just get her off my back!

36:33.800 --> 36:37.440
And you, too.
You're wrinkling my shirt.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.960
&lt; Have we got a history on this?

36:39.960 --> 36:42.480
She was in here every
week for six months.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.760
She tripped on an umbrella.
Her wrist was shattered.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.560
But you don't know
the doctor's name.

36:46.560 --> 36:50.000
He was a very sexy young man,
I remember that.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.920
I wouldn't have an opinion on that.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.040
Well, Mrs Rizzo, is the pain
constant, or only when you move it?

36:57.040 --> 36:58.200
Both.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.680
They gave her Percodan last time.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.320
For a six month-old wrist fracture?

37:02.320 --> 37:06.040
Well, it was my arm bone, actually.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.360
Yeah, well,
I want two new films on this.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.360
I want an AP and a lateral
of her forearm and wrist,

37:11.360 --> 37:14.280
and a urinalysis and a complete
blood chemistry panel.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.840
What is this, the Mayo Clinic?

37:15.840 --> 37:19.840
She doesn't need a diagnosis.
She needs something for the pain.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.840
Excuse me.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.560
The neurovascular exam is normal.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.840
I could get the damn pills
easier on the street!

37:27.840 --> 37:29.000
Isn't she sweet?

37:29.000 --> 37:29.720
Who?

37:29.720 --> 37:33.480
Who?

37:33.480 --> 37:36.240
I had her figured for a narc.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.120
Can't be too careful.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.160
PHONE RINGS

37:40.160 --> 37:43.200
St Eligius emergency.

37:43.200 --> 37:46.360
Well,
then take it out of your mouth.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.440
Come on. Right this way.

37:49.440 --> 37:53.040
Right this way.

37:53.040 --> 37:57.040
Oh.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.000
Miss Leighton, you got company.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.600
Oh, I don't believe it!

38:03.600 --> 38:06.120
Oh, this is too good to be true!

38:06.120 --> 38:08.600
Well, I want a big
hug from all of you!

38:08.600 --> 38:10.280
How did you get here?

38:10.280 --> 38:12.000
Luther drove us over.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.240
In that case, I want a big hug
from you too, Luther.

38:14.240 --> 38:17.640
It was Dr Craig's idea.
Problem is, I dented up the car.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.680
Here you go.
I stole this for you.

38:19.680 --> 38:23.160
Oh, you did not,
but thanks anyway, Vinnie.

38:23.160 --> 38:27.160
Just the thing to take the curse
off this dull hospital plastic.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.960
Oh!

38:29.960 --> 38:32.800
Relax, I'm not going to fall
apart on you, I promise.

38:32.800 --> 38:36.800
Well, sit down, everyone.

38:40.240 --> 38:41.960
Oh, I'd better go.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.680
Somebody might need me.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.720
Oh, thanks again, Luther.
And thank Dr Craig for me, will you?

38:46.720 --> 38:48.240
OK. See you guys later.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.680
Take it easy.

38:49.680 --> 38:50.720
Bye.

38:50.720 --> 38:54.720
Now, tell me everything I missed.
That's every little thing.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.920
Well, Mr Berg got fired.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.520
Berg the jerg, right?
No great loss.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.400
My mum got a temp job.

39:02.400 --> 39:05.440
Oh, Carla, that's great! Where?

39:05.440 --> 39:06.960
Cashier at Christie's.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.440
Oh, terrific.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.600
What about you, Vinnie?
How's your brother doing?

39:10.600 --> 39:12.560
He's back in school.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.720
Mr Dietrich said
he wouldn't press charges

39:14.720 --> 39:16.800
because the stapler only grazed him.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.560
Sounds like I missed
all the excitement!

39:18.560 --> 39:22.400
So, when do you think
they might let you back and teach?

39:22.400 --> 39:26.400
Well, 8.35am,
first day of summer school.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.360
All right!

39:28.360 --> 39:31.440
And I'll be back for graduation
in June.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.440
The guys are going to be
glad to hear that.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.360
Yeah,
because that substitute's no good.

39:35.360 --> 39:38.200
She throws stuff on the board and
expects us to know it by heart.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.840
Hey, I'm not such a soft touch
either, you know.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.600
Yeah, but you wouldn't make us do
term papers on junk.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.000
At least you'd let us
pick our own topics.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
Just wait till next term.

39:55.720 --> 39:59.720
Miss Leighton,
did we do something wrong?

39:59.960 --> 40:03.960
No, you did everything right.

40:25.440 --> 40:28.440
Dr Martin?

40:28.440 --> 40:29.960
Checkmate.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.280
I beg your pardon?

40:32.280 --> 40:35.320
I knew you'd come.
You're Mrs Craig, aren't you?

40:35.320 --> 40:37.600
Yes.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.560
Fate has dealt you a lousy hand,
Mrs Craig.

40:40.560 --> 40:44.560
I hope you can find some way
to accept it.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.840
So, this is where
they keep all the dead bodies.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.920
I want you to realise
your husband and I

40:50.920 --> 40:54.560
were destined to find each other.

40:54.560 --> 40:58.520
He's an extraordinary man.
It's nice that you appreciate him.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.040
Much better for it to end this way

41:00.040 --> 41:03.560
than to continue on with some
empty charade.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.200
What charade is that, dear?

41:06.200 --> 41:07.840
Your marriage.

41:07.840 --> 41:11.080
There's nothing left.
We both know it.

41:11.080 --> 41:15.080
Step aside gracefully.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.320
OK, he's all yours.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.000
Don't patronise me, Mrs Craig.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
I'm not.

41:27.320 --> 41:30.080
Take him.

41:30.080 --> 41:33.360
And you can take the milk he has
every night at bedtime that has

41:33.360 --> 41:37.360
to be 78 degrees Fahrenheit or else
his digestive tract goes geflooey.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.240
And you can take the blades of grass
on the lawn

41:40.240 --> 41:42.240
that have to be exactly an inch high.

41:42.240 --> 41:45.560
I love a perfectionist.

41:45.560 --> 41:48.360
He also dictates the way I dress,

41:48.360 --> 41:52.360
up to and including the fact
that I can never wear black.

41:53.600 --> 41:54.840
No black?

41:54.840 --> 41:58.840
No black.

42:02.040 --> 42:04.880
You really do love him, don't you?

42:04.880 --> 42:07.040
I guess so.

42:07.040 --> 42:11.040
Otherwise, why would
I put up with all this crap?

42:15.800 --> 42:18.640
The noblest thing
I can do is step aside

42:18.640 --> 42:22.640
and preserve the sanctity
of your relationship.

42:23.520 --> 42:27.520
I knew you'd see it my way.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.240
Oh, I wanted to ask you.

42:33.240 --> 42:34.800
Where did you get that clock?

42:34.800 --> 42:36.280
I'd like to buy one for my mother.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.840
What clock?

42:37.840 --> 42:40.640
The one you sent Dr Craig.

42:40.640 --> 42:44.360
I never sent him a clock.

42:44.360 --> 42:48.360
Oh.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.320
Mrs Craig...

42:51.320 --> 42:53.440
..what if I had demanded
you release him?

42:53.440 --> 42:54.680
What would you have done?

42:54.680 --> 42:57.560
Cathy, we're civilised adults.

42:57.560 --> 43:01.560
I'd have punched your lights out.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
BASKETBALL GAME PLAYS ON TV

43:10.720 --> 43:11.840
&lt; There you go.

43:11.840 --> 43:15.120
&lt; Good stew, huh?

43:15.120 --> 43:17.360
There we go.

43:17.360 --> 43:21.360
Thank you.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.400
&lt; How are you?

43:29.400 --> 43:30.480
Evening.

43:30.480 --> 43:32.280
What'll you have?

43:32.280 --> 43:34.560
Pot roast.

43:34.560 --> 43:35.600
Hear it's real good.

43:35.600 --> 43:37.280
You have to sit at a table if
you're underage.

43:37.280 --> 43:38.480
You have to sit at a table if
you're underage.

43:38.480 --> 43:42.480
That one over there's empty.

43:47.360 --> 43:50.600
Damn, I think I left my lights on.
Be right back.

43:50.600 --> 43:54.600
OK.

43:56.280 --> 43:59.120
I've been hearing lots of complaints
about your stuffed peppers.

43:59.120 --> 44:00.240
Yeah, well I love them.

44:00.240 --> 44:04.240
Well, that's good, because there'll
be plenty left over for breakfast.

44:08.560 --> 44:10.840
I wonder where he's going?
He just ordered dinner.

44:10.840 --> 44:13.000
Maybe he heard about your peppers.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
Get out of here!

44:50.400 --> 44:52.640
Peter.

44:52.640 --> 44:56.000
I just wanted to let you know that we
managed to kill the public hearing.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.280
That's great.

44:57.280 --> 45:00.360
Yeah, but you're still going to have
to appear before the board.

45:00.360 --> 45:01.760
But it's executive session,
so no press.

45:01.760 --> 45:03.160
But it's executive session,
so no press.

45:03.160 --> 45:05.720
I wish we could kill the subpoena,
but, anyway,

45:05.720 --> 45:07.880
Dr Auschlander and I are both going
to be there to back you up.

45:07.880 --> 45:09.080
Dr Auschlander and I are both going
to be there to back you up.

45:09.080 --> 45:13.080
See you.

45:33.400 --> 45:37.400
DOCTORS SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER.

45:42.960 --> 45:44.440
&lt; I'm going to call plastics.

45:44.440 --> 45:48.400
&lt; Hurry it up. We've got 18 other
people to see here.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.480
I'm glad you're here, Peter.
There's a bombing.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.120
We could use all the help
we can get.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.520
Jack, come over here.

45:53.520 --> 45:56.960
She's got a dislocated shoulder
and a severe pelvic injury.

45:56.960 --> 45:57.680
Those two are gone, Peter. DOA.

45:57.680 --> 45:58.560
Those two are gone, Peter. DOA.

45:58.560 --> 46:02.560
Those two are gone, Peter. DOA.

46:04.480 --> 46:07.400
Get a tracheotomy set.
Call respiratory.

46:07.400 --> 46:11.400
To the lab with ABGs, lights prepped,
hypo, cross-match, stat.

46:15.080 --> 46:18.640
Put those over there. &gt;

46:18.640 --> 46:22.640
Order some fresh plasma. &gt;

46:44.200 --> 46:54.000
