00:03.757 --> 00:06.225
<i>Lately, people around here
were happier than usual.</i>

00:06.468 --> 00:09.585
<i>Elliot, because she had finally said
those three magic words.</i>

00:09.847 --> 00:11.121
I love you.

00:12.641 --> 00:15.838
<i>Todd, because he had finally
found his true calling as a doctor.</i>

00:16.103 --> 00:17.377
So, what's up with plastic surgery?

00:17.563 --> 00:18.678
Dude, it's amazing.

00:18.856 --> 00:21.051
Just when you think you can't see
another great pair of boobs,

00:21.275 --> 00:22.594
you see an awesome dong.

00:22.776 --> 00:25.768
<i>And Dr Kelso was giddy because
it was the first Monday of the month.</i>

00:26.030 --> 00:28.828
<i>And today,
nothing could dampen his spirits,</i>

00:29.074 --> 00:30.792
<i>not even a grieving family.</i>

00:30.993 --> 00:33.223
I am so sorry for your loss.

00:33.454 --> 00:35.524
He was a fighter right till the end.

00:36.165 --> 00:38.360
We did everything we could.

00:39.376 --> 00:42.891
<i>See, today was the day
the hypodermic needles arrived.</i>

00:45.466 --> 00:48.617
- Happy Needle Day, Lloyd.
- And to you, sir.

00:48.886 --> 00:51.639
And thanks for sending down
an extra set of hands.

00:51.889 --> 00:53.004
I'm a lawyer.

00:53.682 --> 00:56.515
I still don't understand why you get
so excited over needles.

00:56.769 --> 00:59.442
Thanks to a delightful decimal error

00:59.688 --> 01:03.124
made 20 years ago by the
good folks at Zeffer Pharmaceuticals,

01:03.400 --> 01:07.359
each month, Sacred Heart
gets $50,000 worth

01:07.654 --> 01:11.647
of hypodermic needles
for the low, low price of $50.

01:12.034 --> 01:13.592
That's it.

01:14.536 --> 01:16.572
I can't feel my arms.

01:16.789 --> 01:20.418
Now, Lloyd, given your past history
as a dirt bag junkie,

01:20.709 --> 01:22.108
I have to ask.

01:23.337 --> 01:26.010
Did you take
any of Uncle Bob's needles?

01:26.382 --> 01:28.338
No, sir. I don't use needles any more.

01:28.550 --> 01:31.826
- Oh, so you finally got clean?
- No. Sign here.

01:32.930 --> 01:34.568
This is a straw, Lloyd.

01:35.391 --> 01:38.667
Doctor Reid! I have a package for you.

01:39.144 --> 01:41.374
It's addressed to your home,
but since you're here...

01:41.605 --> 01:44.073
Lloyd, I wanted that delivered
to my house because it's private

01:44.316 --> 01:47.672
and it'll be embarrassing for me
to open it here at the hospital.

01:49.238 --> 01:50.910
- We can't.
- We have to.

01:51.115 --> 01:52.070
Wait.

01:52.241 --> 01:54.596
You're talking about
opening someone else's mail.

01:54.827 --> 01:55.976
I think we should stop for a moment

01:56.161 --> 01:59.039
and consider
the ethical implications here.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.356
All done.

02:08.799 --> 02:11.029
Keith, I'm home.

02:11.427 --> 02:12.746
Hey, Dr Reid.

02:12.928 --> 02:15.806
We accidentally opened your package
and felt so guilty,

02:16.056 --> 02:18.092
we came by to install your

02:18.308 --> 02:20.697
"Slide and Glide Stripper Pole. "

02:21.186 --> 02:22.585
How did you get in here?

02:22.771 --> 02:25.046
Hot cookies, anyone?

02:25.524 --> 02:26.513
Keith!

02:28.027 --> 02:30.541
Do you know how hard it is
to install those things?

02:30.779 --> 02:31.973
Just be grateful.

02:37.202 --> 02:38.920
You guys are gonna love this!

02:39.121 --> 02:40.713
Oh, yeah!

02:41.081 --> 02:44.153
- Why did he take off his shirt?
- I don't know, Keith.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:00.059 --> 03:02.698
I have a small, non-fat latte
for Dr Dorian.

03:03.145 --> 03:05.534
What the hell, Long-Face?
We were here first.

03:05.773 --> 03:07.286
Yeah, but Dr D's the king.

03:07.483 --> 03:09.792
I didn't ask to be special,
it just kind of happened.

03:10.027 --> 03:12.336
<i>Still, after six years of being
the star around here,</i>

03:12.571 --> 03:14.209
<i>I couldn't help but wonder
what it would be like</i>

03:14.406 --> 03:17.876
<i>if the spotlight were on some of
my supporting players for a change.</i>

03:18.369 --> 03:19.848
Jumbo coffee for Todd.

03:20.079 --> 03:21.956
Everything's jumbo on the Todd.

03:23.207 --> 03:24.526
<i>It doesn't matter that he's a dude.</i>

03:24.708 --> 03:26.824
<i>People should know
you're well-endowed.</i>

03:27.252 --> 03:29.368
- Cappuccino for Jordan.
- Give me that.

03:29.922 --> 03:32.072
<i>Now, let's see who I can sit with</i>

03:32.299 --> 03:34.654
<i>that will drive me the least insane.</i>

03:36.136 --> 03:37.569
<i>Definitely not.</i>

03:37.763 --> 03:39.913
<i>Oh, what a sweet moment.</i>

03:40.557 --> 03:41.831
<i>I should ruin it.</i>

03:42.101 --> 03:43.454
Stop that!

03:43.936 --> 03:45.449
We're on me now.

03:46.522 --> 03:48.035
Extra hot tea for Ted.

03:49.483 --> 03:51.633
<i>He didn't give you
a cardboard sleeve.</i>

03:51.860 --> 03:54.932
<i>Still, don't rock the boat.
You don't want people staring.</i>

03:55.197 --> 03:56.994
<i>Besides, how hot can it be?</i>

03:57.199 --> 03:59.155
<i>Holy mother of God!</i>

03:59.368 --> 04:02.280
<i>Huge mistake, huge mistake!</i>

04:03.455 --> 04:05.969
<i>Just keep moving. No one saw that.</i>

04:08.711 --> 04:09.939
<i>Kelso.</i>

04:13.841 --> 04:15.160
<i>What's going on?</i>

04:15.342 --> 04:17.139
<i>Hey, maybe it's the surprise party</i>

04:17.344 --> 04:19.062
<i>you've been waiting for
your whole life.</i>

04:19.262 --> 04:21.935
<i>Just play it cool, Teddy-boy.</i>

04:22.182 --> 04:23.900
The party man is here!

04:24.226 --> 04:26.103
It's not a surprise party, Ted.

04:26.729 --> 04:27.923
It'll never be.

04:28.522 --> 04:32.151
<i>Nurse Espinosa
and her chiquita nursitas are here</i>

04:32.443 --> 04:34.513
<i>because they want more dinero.</i>

04:34.903 --> 04:37.861
<i>Dr Kelso and his racism.</i>

04:38.115 --> 04:41.710
We're not asking for much,
just the basic cost-of-living raise.

04:42.077 --> 04:43.556
No chance, pink pants.

04:44.371 --> 04:47.522
Sir, the last thing we need is a strike.

04:47.833 --> 04:49.664
They'll never do it, Ted.

04:49.877 --> 04:51.549
A strike would hurt the patients.

04:51.754 --> 04:54.222
See, that's their biggest weakness.

04:54.465 --> 04:56.183
They care about the patients.

04:56.550 --> 04:58.302
This isn't over, Dr Kelso.

04:58.802 --> 05:00.599
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Scram.

05:02.723 --> 05:04.873
Sir, they aren't asking for much,

05:05.100 --> 05:07.170
and the little things can
make a big difference.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.625
I know I'd be a lot happier
with some extra cash,

05:10.898 --> 05:12.251
or friend,

05:12.441 --> 05:13.510
or hair.

05:13.734 --> 05:16.373
How would your life be any different
if you had hair?

05:24.578 --> 05:27.251
Don't worry, baby. You'll get your turn.

05:27.706 --> 05:29.856
Which conditioner
are you going to buy?

05:37.925 --> 05:39.438
Too many choices!

05:41.804 --> 05:42.759
Mom?

05:48.310 --> 05:49.299
Mom?

05:51.980 --> 05:53.572
No!

05:54.400 --> 05:56.038
Why do I have hair?

05:56.568 --> 05:58.286
Why do I have hair?

05:58.654 --> 06:00.645
Why?

06:04.535 --> 06:07.527
I wonder if they'd still do me
after I buried Mom.

06:10.874 --> 06:12.466
- Rounds sucked today.
- I know.

06:12.668 --> 06:14.260
Dr Wen didn't set me up once.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.656
He never said "bone,"
"organ" or "suction. "

06:16.880 --> 06:18.552
I mean, I did what I could
with "carpal tunnel,"

06:18.799 --> 06:21.996
but I don't think people got that I was
using that as a metaphor for vagina.

06:22.261 --> 06:24.217
No, Todd, I'm talking about

06:24.430 --> 06:27.388
when that intern asked me about
cardiovascular instabilities.

06:28.392 --> 06:30.144
<i>- Dude, I've got to tell you, man...
- Turk's bummed.</i>

06:30.352 --> 06:32.912
<i>He definitely needs a high-five,
but which one?</i>

06:33.147 --> 06:34.899
<i>Chin-up five, tough-to-be-black five,</i>

06:35.107 --> 06:36.904
<i>need-a-hug five, need-a-tug five?</i>

06:37.151 --> 06:39.062
<i>Wait, what's he talking about?</i>

06:39.278 --> 06:41.917
<i>Okay, just take the last word he says
and add a five to it.</i>

06:42.156 --> 06:44.147
I don't know,
it just all seems a little unfair.

06:44.366 --> 06:45.640
Unfair five.

06:46.577 --> 06:48.295
Thanks, man. You always know
the right things to say.

06:48.537 --> 06:49.970
I work hard on those.

06:50.748 --> 06:52.784
- Excuse me, Dr Quinlan?
- Who?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.592
- That's you, Todd.
- Oh, yeah.

06:54.793 --> 06:57.512
I just want to thank you for helping
with my daughter's condition.

06:58.088 --> 07:01.080
It's hard enough being 16
and she shouldn't have to be teased

07:01.342 --> 07:04.095
by her classmates just because
she looks so different.

07:04.428 --> 07:06.066
I am glad to help, ma'am.

07:08.349 --> 07:10.658
You are making a difference
in her daughter's life.

07:10.893 --> 07:13.726
What are you fixing,
some type of major facial deformity?

07:13.979 --> 07:17.130
- No, I'm giving her giant cans.
- Okay.

07:19.860 --> 07:21.976
Have you ever heard the phrase,
"Excuse me"?

07:22.196 --> 07:25.871
Here, take the fake sugars, 'cause
I hope you get cancer, I really do.

07:30.913 --> 07:32.983
Well, my parents were mean to me.

07:33.582 --> 07:35.538
- Oh...
- They were mean, apparently.

07:36.293 --> 07:38.284
Keith and I are always so busy,
that he suggested

07:38.504 --> 07:40.620
that we meet here for ten minutes
before our shift starts

07:40.839 --> 07:43.558
for coffee, for some together-time.
Isn't that sweet?

07:45.052 --> 07:47.771
That may have been
the most bored I've ever been

07:48.013 --> 07:49.969
whilst someone was talking to me.

07:50.391 --> 07:51.983
She's ruining coffee-time.

07:52.267 --> 07:54.258
Just pretend she's not here.

07:55.312 --> 07:57.872
<i>- So, anyways, babe...
- I hate everybody.</i>

07:58.148 --> 07:59.342
<i>Oh, look at those two.</i>

07:59.525 --> 08:01.170
<i>Must be the Beard of The Month Club.</i>

08:01.360 --> 08:05.194
<i>"My beard is nice and white. "
"Well, my beard is more bushy. "</i>

08:06.156 --> 08:07.384
<i>"Let's be friends!"</i>

08:07.574 --> 08:08.609
<i>Morons.</i>

08:08.784 --> 08:10.900
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

08:14.915 --> 08:16.394
Whoa, what the hell was that?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.141
I finally told Keith I loved him.

08:18.335 --> 08:20.132
Now that you've said
what he wants to hear,

08:20.337 --> 08:21.816
he doesn't have to work for it.

08:22.006 --> 08:24.156
It's like when guys are really trying
to sleep with you.

08:24.383 --> 08:26.817
When you finally give it up,
there are no more flowers.

08:27.052 --> 08:28.883
Next thing you know, it's 20 years later

08:29.096 --> 08:30.529
and you're standing over him
while he sleeps,

08:30.723 --> 08:33.681
your third martini in one hand
and a steak knife in the other.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.970
And sure, he's taken a sleeping pill,

08:36.186 --> 08:39.940
so you can slice his arm open
a little bit without waking him up,

08:40.232 --> 08:42.792
but it's not satisfying,
and you know why?

08:43.110 --> 08:44.668
Because you've lost the power.

08:44.862 --> 08:46.056
Hey, Per-Per,

08:46.238 --> 08:48.798
did you ever figure out
what happened to your arm?

08:49.033 --> 08:50.022
No.

08:52.703 --> 08:54.022
Yes, phew.

08:57.082 --> 08:59.073
Carla, can you pull a file for me?

08:59.793 --> 09:04.264
Sorry, I need another five hours
to put this box of needles away.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.907
- I don't get it.
- It's a slowdown, Ted.

09:08.177 --> 09:11.328
The nurses think they're being clever,
still treating patients,

09:11.597 --> 09:13.952
but with everything else
moving more slowly.

09:14.183 --> 09:16.617
And why are you standing here
doing nothing?

09:16.852 --> 09:18.285
I know this is a slowdown,

09:18.479 --> 09:21.516
but I can't really work
any slower than I normally do,

09:21.774 --> 09:23.810
so I pretty much have to
come to a complete stop.

09:24.026 --> 09:26.142
Now, if you're asking why I'm standing
here specifically,

09:26.362 --> 09:29.752
it's because I replaced that light bulb
with a tanning bulb.

09:30.032 --> 09:32.102
I'm tired of being the only white guy
at my mosque.

09:34.536 --> 09:36.925
You know what?
If the nurses keep going on like this,

09:37.164 --> 09:38.358
I'm going to give them their raise,

09:38.540 --> 09:40.496
but I'm going to pay for it
by firing three of them,

09:40.709 --> 09:42.188
the ugly ones. How does that sound?

09:42.378 --> 09:43.857
<i>Whatever you think is right, sir.</i>

09:44.046 --> 09:45.161
You're an ass.

09:45.339 --> 09:47.853
<i>Ted, you idiot. You just said
the out-loud thing in your head</i>

09:48.175 --> 09:49.847
<i>and the in-your-head thing out loud!</i>

09:50.052 --> 09:52.520
<i>Don't make eye contact,
just keep moving!</i>

09:57.685 --> 09:59.721
I'm sorry, but that mother should not
be giving that little girl

09:59.937 --> 10:01.495
breast implants for her
sweet-sixteen present.

10:01.689 --> 10:04.123
So she's 16.
What's the big deal, T-Dog?

10:04.400 --> 10:07.119
Well, I have a daughter.
Imagine being a parent.

10:11.115 --> 10:12.753
Dad, can I talk to you?

10:13.534 --> 10:14.523
What's up?

10:15.285 --> 10:17.480
I don't want to wear
a banana hammock any more.

10:18.163 --> 10:20.438
Rod! Why?

10:22.876 --> 10:24.195
Because I stuff.

10:24.545 --> 10:26.501
Want to know a secret?

10:30.843 --> 10:32.162
I stuff, too.

10:34.805 --> 10:36.158
There you go.

10:37.725 --> 10:39.124
I don't stuff.

10:39.393 --> 10:40.872
Maybe you should.

10:41.603 --> 10:43.833
You know what?
I will just have a little conversation

10:44.064 --> 10:46.294
with your department head.

10:48.318 --> 10:50.832
All I'm saying is, it's not right.
The girl's only 16.

10:51.071 --> 10:54.461
Yeah. No, I felt the same way
until her mother's cheque cleared.

10:55.534 --> 10:56.728
Look, you're not even
in my department,

10:56.910 --> 10:58.582
so maybe I'm missing something here?

10:58.829 --> 11:02.060
Do you see any of your beeswax here?
Because I sure as hell don't.

11:02.374 --> 11:04.205
Todd, do you see Dr Turk's beeswax?

11:04.418 --> 11:05.976
<i>What the hell is he talking about?</i>

11:06.170 --> 11:07.398
Todd, come.

11:08.964 --> 11:11.922
Look, I know your buddy thinks
he's the bee's knees...

11:12.176 --> 11:14.053
<i>What is with this dude and bees?</i>

11:14.303 --> 11:15.941
...but if he keeps poking his nose
in my business,

11:16.138 --> 11:18.527
I will torch him with
every department head in this place.

11:18.807 --> 11:20.957
See how that helps his career.

11:21.518 --> 11:23.429
Internal "uh-oh" five.

11:27.733 --> 11:30.531
What took you so long? I need a drink!

11:30.861 --> 11:33.898
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
I was just with this super-rude patient

11:34.156 --> 11:37.068
whose heart kept stopping.
He's dead now,

11:37.326 --> 11:40.602
but, darn it all, he should've known
that my ex-wife was down here

11:40.871 --> 11:42.623
jonesing for a Cosmo.

11:43.082 --> 11:44.913
<i>He is so getting cut again tonight.</i>

11:45.250 --> 11:47.286
I gotta go get my jacket.

11:47.836 --> 11:50.111
All right, Trish,
I'm off to the movies with my boyfriend

11:50.339 --> 11:51.294
who doesn't treat me any differently,

11:51.465 --> 11:53.137
even though I already said I loved him.

11:53.342 --> 11:54.457
My name's not Trish.

11:54.635 --> 11:56.353
That's okay, it was for her benefit.

11:57.388 --> 11:58.741
Hey, sweetie.

12:00.766 --> 12:02.324
The guys are going to play poker.

12:02.518 --> 12:05.032
- Is it okay if we skip the movie?
- Sure.

12:05.729 --> 12:07.287
Oh, thanks, babe.

12:08.691 --> 12:11.728
<i>Don't say anything.
Let the dark side draw her in.</i>

12:12.152 --> 12:13.744
<i>Come on, come to Mama.</i>

12:13.946 --> 12:15.777
- Jordan, teach me.
- Okay, it's simple.

12:15.989 --> 12:19.299
If he thinks it's okay to mess with you,
you just mess with him.

12:19.952 --> 12:21.146
Done!

12:21.620 --> 12:24.134
<i>It's so fun to screw
with someone's relationship,</i>

12:24.373 --> 12:26.682
<i>and such good practise
for when my daughter grows up.</i>

12:26.917 --> 12:29.795
<i>- Still, when someone...
... is heading down a bad path,</i>

12:30.045 --> 12:31.683
<i>I'd always try to stop them.</i>

12:31.880 --> 12:35.111
Carla, I think you should
reconsider the slowdown.

12:35.384 --> 12:36.612
Can't talk, Ted.

12:36.802 --> 12:39.919
Julie and I have to carry
this chart to this patient's room.

12:41.181 --> 12:43.297
<i>Of course, there's nothing I can do...</i>

12:43.684 --> 12:45.720
<i>...if they're as stubborn as Turk is.</i>

12:45.936 --> 12:48.689
This isn't over, man.
That girl should not be having surgery.

12:48.939 --> 12:50.577
Dude, you shouldn't
screw with Dr Green.

12:50.774 --> 12:52.890
I'm not afraid of Dr Green.

12:55.154 --> 12:57.588
<i>Great, that just makes me want to...</i>

12:57.823 --> 13:00.132
<i>...laugh and laugh and laugh.</i>

13:00.367 --> 13:03.404
<i>I mean, look at him there by himself.
Rub it in for funsies.</i>

13:03.662 --> 13:05.380
Hey, Keith, where's Blondie?

13:05.581 --> 13:07.697
I thought it was
your little coffee-date time.

13:07.916 --> 13:11.352
If she was mad about something,
why wouldn't she just tell me?

13:11.628 --> 13:14.700
You know, I guess I thought
once she finally said "I love you,"

13:14.965 --> 13:17.718
all this insecure game-playing
would stop, you know?

13:20.262 --> 13:21.581
Bye, Jordan.

13:21.930 --> 13:26.162
<i>That did not give me the delicious,
satisfied feeling I was going for.</i>

13:32.775 --> 13:34.094
Oh, look, it's Keith.

13:34.276 --> 13:36.312
Yeah, well, if he wants to talk to me,
he can find me, right?

13:36.528 --> 13:37.517
Right.

13:38.781 --> 13:40.931
Perry, I think there's
something wrong with me.

13:41.158 --> 13:44.753
Now, that is the understatement
of this still-very-young century.

13:45.454 --> 13:48.366
I may have screwed up
Blonde Stick's relationship,

13:48.624 --> 13:51.582
and now I have this really weird feeling.

13:52.002 --> 13:53.958
It's called guilt, you Vulcan.

13:54.213 --> 13:56.681
And why the hell are you giving out
relationship advice, anyway?

13:56.924 --> 13:58.323
What are you, Oprah?

14:02.262 --> 14:03.661
Hi, everyone!

14:03.847 --> 14:05.883
We're back.
We're talking with Barbara,

14:06.100 --> 14:10.298
a cancer survivor, who went on
to form her own head scarf company.

14:10.604 --> 14:12.003
Tell us about that.

14:12.564 --> 14:14.395
When my hair fell out from the chemo...

14:14.608 --> 14:18.567
Not only is that a huge downer,
but scarves are tacky.

14:18.862 --> 14:22.821
Instead, how about I dance
with a little girl who looks just like me?

14:27.162 --> 14:29.312
Right? Look at us, we're like twins.

14:32.084 --> 14:33.437
Can you believe it?

14:34.003 --> 14:35.880
I would watch that show.

14:36.964 --> 14:38.716
Anyway, go fix this for me.

14:38.924 --> 14:41.597
Barbie can handle this on her own.
She is an adult.

14:45.222 --> 14:48.498
See, Keith, I've been practising,
and you're missing it.

14:51.270 --> 14:53.420
You wanna make 12, 13 bucks?

14:54.231 --> 14:56.028
Just send it to Keith, Lloyd.

14:57.443 --> 14:58.842
Oh, come on!

15:00.195 --> 15:02.470
J. D., Turk shouldn't
mess with Dr Green.

15:02.698 --> 15:04.495
Now, even though
you're only his second-best friend,

15:04.700 --> 15:06.535
for some reason he listens to you.

15:06.660 --> 15:09.572
If Turk's mind is set on something,
it can't be changed.

15:09.830 --> 15:12.139
I can't even imagine how I'd try.

15:12.374 --> 15:15.093
<i>Oh, great, there he goes,
off into his fantasy world.</i>

15:15.336 --> 15:17.008
<i>Now I'm stuck here waiting
till he snaps out of it</i>

15:17.212 --> 15:18.804
<i>with some weird comment.</i>

15:19.590 --> 15:21.706
We'd have to find
a whole lot of gnomes.

15:21.925 --> 15:23.119
That's helpful.

15:27.639 --> 15:29.197
- Excuse me.
- Hang on, one sec.

15:29.391 --> 15:30.983
Got to make one of these.

15:32.144 --> 15:33.463
Oh, damn it!

15:33.812 --> 15:37.122
- What are you aiming at?
- Nothing. What's on your mind?

15:38.108 --> 15:41.305
Carla needs to end this slowdown,
but she won't listen to me.

15:41.612 --> 15:43.807
People rarely do. Will you talk to her?

15:45.282 --> 15:46.271
Yes!

15:46.700 --> 15:48.179
No. Can't do it, Ted.

15:48.369 --> 15:49.768
If you piss her off,
she's going to turn on you,

15:49.953 --> 15:52.513
and I can't have her digging up
the skeletons in my closet.

15:52.748 --> 15:54.898
Although, technically, they won't be
skeletons for six to eight weeks.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.514
Right now, they're just dead badgers.

15:59.046 --> 16:03.756
<i>Okay, time to set things straight with
that neurotic, bug-eyed, straw-haired...</i>

16:04.301 --> 16:05.859
My parents were mean to me.

16:06.387 --> 16:08.855
You don't need to say that.
I don't know what you were thinking,

16:09.098 --> 16:11.248
although I'm sure it was lovely.

16:13.811 --> 16:15.688
<i>I need someone Turk will listen to,</i>

16:15.896 --> 16:18.774
<i>someone persuasive,
forceful, sensitive.</i>

16:19.024 --> 16:21.219
<i>If only my dong could talk.</i>

16:22.027 --> 16:24.302
<i>Hey, I bet he'd listen to you.</i>

16:25.406 --> 16:27.840
<i>I've got to find a way
to stop this slowdown</i>

16:28.075 --> 16:30.111
<i>before someone loses their job.</i>

16:32.871 --> 16:35.226
The stress is killing me.

16:35.457 --> 16:39.496
You're sweating because
you're under the tanning bulb, genius.

16:40.713 --> 16:43.671
<i>If only the nurses had leverage,
I could help them.</i>

16:44.258 --> 16:47.250
Ted, I found this extra box of needles
in my truck.

16:48.012 --> 16:49.161
Needles.

16:50.222 --> 16:51.735
There's leverage.

16:51.932 --> 16:53.843
Man, you keep this place toasty.

16:57.438 --> 16:58.951
So, you wanted to talk to me?

16:59.148 --> 17:01.378
I'm about to speak to you
from the heart,

17:01.608 --> 17:03.678
and since that's very difficult for me,

17:03.902 --> 17:07.611
I need you to sit there silently
while I mentally prepare myself.

17:08.156 --> 17:09.351
Jordan, I have patients...

17:09.532 --> 17:10.488
Sorry.

17:12.744 --> 17:13.700
I'm telling you right now,

17:13.871 --> 17:15.304
me and your department head
are about to have it out.

17:15.497 --> 17:17.532
This surgery ain't happening.
Not on my watch!

17:17.750 --> 17:19.103
- I always wanted to say that.
- Okay.

17:19.292 --> 17:22.365
Before you do anything,
just listen to what she has to say.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.393
I want the implants.

17:25.382 --> 17:29.261
Look, I'm constantly mistaken
for a fifth-grader, and I'm tired of it.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.612
This is my choice,

17:32.056 --> 17:34.650
and it's taken me a long time
to convince my mom,

17:34.892 --> 17:37.008
but she's finally supporting me.

17:37.227 --> 17:39.104
I shouldn't have to convince you, too.

17:43.275 --> 17:44.993
What are you buzzing around here for?

17:45.194 --> 17:48.072
Dr Quinlan and I had to
discuss something

17:48.322 --> 17:50.631
that has absolutely nothing
to do with anything

17:50.866 --> 17:52.458
that's happening up in here.

17:52.659 --> 17:55.127
So, you were right, and okay.

17:58.457 --> 18:00.925
Yeah. He's a busy little bee.

18:01.919 --> 18:04.956
Dude, I've got to ask.
What's with you and bees?

18:07.299 --> 18:08.937
What are you thinking, Ted?

18:09.134 --> 18:11.648
<i>I could jam this through the soft spot
on his temple,</i>

18:11.887 --> 18:14.924
<i>then slit my wrists with it
before anyone got in here to stop me.</i>

18:15.182 --> 18:16.376
The usual, sir.

18:16.642 --> 18:19.395
Well, you'd never do it.
You don't have the guts.

18:21.939 --> 18:24.578
If it's okay with you,
we'll take that raise now.

18:24.983 --> 18:28.134
Okay, but in this little fantasy of yours,

18:28.404 --> 18:30.315
can I not have prostate
problems any more?

18:30.531 --> 18:33.807
I can't sleep more than 40 minutes
without needing to take a whiz.

18:34.326 --> 18:36.920
Unfortunately for you,
somebody left the invoice

18:37.162 --> 18:39.198
for the hospital needles on my desk.

18:39.415 --> 18:41.485
They are really undercharging you.

18:42.251 --> 18:46.722
So, either you shell out the extra
20 grand a month for our raises,

18:47.047 --> 18:50.835
or we call the needle company
and it'll cost you twice that.

18:52.553 --> 18:55.067
Ted, are you responsible for this?

18:55.556 --> 18:58.434
Please, sir, I don't have the guts.

18:59.852 --> 19:02.412
<i>Oh, yeah! Suck it, bitch!</i>

19:02.646 --> 19:04.318
<i>I will murder you!</i>

19:06.942 --> 19:09.217
I don't know why
I messed with your head.

19:10.237 --> 19:11.955
Did you start talking?

19:12.156 --> 19:13.555
Because I should brush my teeth.

19:13.741 --> 19:15.971
At first, I thought I was just being mean,

19:16.201 --> 19:18.920
because you know
I enjoy the misery of others.

19:19.163 --> 19:20.596
It's not really a secret.

19:21.248 --> 19:23.398
Whenever I see someone in love,

19:23.959 --> 19:26.393
I just lose it,
and turn into an awful person.

19:27.129 --> 19:30.599
Give yourself a break, Jordan.
Your parents were really mean to you.

19:30.883 --> 19:33.317
Here's the big secret. They weren't.

19:33.719 --> 19:37.712
They were actually very supportive.
I don't know how this happened.

19:38.015 --> 19:42.054
Look, Elliot, I'm a woman
in her very, very, very late 30s

19:42.811 --> 19:45.609
who has problems
opening herself up to love.

19:45.856 --> 19:49.212
I hate being vulnerable.
I still play mind games.

19:49.485 --> 19:53.603
Hell, to make Perry feel inadequate,
sometimes I fake not having orgasms.

19:55.199 --> 19:57.918
The point is, if you want to be happy,

19:58.160 --> 20:00.355
you should never, ever listen to me.

20:02.206 --> 20:04.481
You maybe also want to say
you're sorry?

20:04.833 --> 20:05.868
I do not.

20:11.632 --> 20:12.951
Come on.

20:13.801 --> 20:15.598
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

20:16.553 --> 20:17.668
I love you.

20:22.559 --> 20:25.869
<i>Even though I caused it,
it still feels mildly heartwarming</i>

20:26.146 --> 20:27.704
<i>to fix someone's problem.</i>

20:28.732 --> 20:30.927
- Hello.
- What's up?

20:31.151 --> 20:33.904
<i>That's why I'm glad I kept Turk
from messing up his career.</i>

20:34.154 --> 20:36.190
<i>And I don't care if the nurses
ever find out</i>

20:36.407 --> 20:38.284
<i>that it was me who helped them.</i>

20:40.953 --> 20:43.706
<i>- I guess we all have our parts to play.
- I guess we all have our parts to play.</i>

20:43.956 --> 20:46.424
Okay, I have a coffee
for Snoop Dogg Resident.

20:47.751 --> 20:50.311
<i>I wish just once
someone would call me Ronald.</i>

20:50.546 --> 20:51.979
<i>Where did I park my truck?</i>

20:52.172 --> 20:54.288
<i>Bees, bees, bees.</i>

20:54.508 --> 20:56.976
<i>That nurse is hot.</i>
