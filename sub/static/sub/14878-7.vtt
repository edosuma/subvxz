00:52.919 --> 00:54.011
Good morning.

00:54.087 --> 00:56.021
Stupid lnternet.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.216
What's with the Four Seasons
breakfast spread?

00:59.192 --> 01:01.888
Taking pictures
for my catering site.
Don't touch.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.388
Mmm.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.193
Sorry. I didn't know.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.967
It doesn't matter.
It takes, like, 200 pictures
to get anything worth using.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.230
And now I can't upload.

01:11.337 --> 01:13.100
How am I supposed
to start a business?

01:13.473 --> 01:15.464
You don't have to get
everything to work instantly.

01:15.842 --> 01:18.504
I know. It's just
every other mom
in the play group

01:18.578 --> 01:20.910
works at least part-time.
Now, with Michael
out of work...

01:20.980 --> 01:22.072
He knows you're trying.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.548
And "super mom" is
not an easy job.

01:24.784 --> 01:28.276
Mmm, but if you're going
to do this breakfast thing,

01:28.354 --> 01:29.582
do you think you can
get fresh squeezed?

01:29.656 --> 01:32.420
Because this OJ
from concentrate
tastes like sand.

01:35.462 --> 01:36.986
Wait. Don't move.

01:37.197 --> 01:39.392
That's the perfect light.
Oh!

01:39.466 --> 01:40.626
Okay, ready?

01:44.571 --> 01:46.505
Mommy, Elmo went away.

01:54.013 --> 01:55.981
Cable's out.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.117
You know, I don't know
if you've heard,

02:02.188 --> 02:06.522
but most of the civilized
world went hi-def
a few years back.

02:06.593 --> 02:08.651
I never claimed
to be civilized.

02:08.728 --> 02:11.162
Plus, I haven't had much use
for a new TV lately.

02:11.231 --> 02:14.098
Well, you may not,
but I want to watch
myself in 1080p

02:14.167 --> 02:16.965
when that call
from Charlie Rose comes in.

02:17.937 --> 02:19.495
What makes me think that
that's only going to happen

02:19.572 --> 02:22.302
when I'm on trial
for espionage?

02:22.642 --> 02:24.269
Oh, silly Auggie.

02:25.044 --> 02:27.478
You're not the only person
I know at the ClA.

02:27.547 --> 02:29.777
Just the only one
you're sleeping with.

02:32.685 --> 02:33.879
Or maybe not.

02:33.953 --> 02:36.649
You know
it's just you.

02:36.723 --> 02:37.815
Mmm-hmm.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.324
And the others are...

02:39.392 --> 02:40.723
Just sources.

02:40.793 --> 02:42.658
Sources?
Mmm-hmm.

02:43.296 --> 02:44.593
I'm not a source.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.359
You're a source
of happiness.

02:48.801 --> 02:50.393
Do we have time?

02:52.305 --> 02:55.468
Don't they call in
the cavalry when you
miss work? Mmm.

02:55.542 --> 03:00.036
Not if I call in.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.246
Cable's out. Phone's out.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.617
It's not the 13th
already, is it?

03:13.693 --> 03:15.593
Yeah. Why?
I've got to go.

03:23.002 --> 03:24.196
Joan, hear me out.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.329
There was a metro-wide
communications
shutdown today.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.966
No cable, no lnternet,
no cellular network,

03:29.042 --> 03:31.237
and I bet the satellite array
was down for 10 minutes.

03:31.311 --> 03:34.212
That's classified.
It was more like 15.

03:35.315 --> 03:38.443
This was not an accident.
I guarantee you.

03:38.518 --> 03:41.715
There is a hacker out there
somewhere who is trying
to make a name for themself.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.847
The Datatech Conference
starts today.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.249
You've got to send me in.

03:45.325 --> 03:48.351
There's a briefing in 10.
Signals lntelligence
is running point.

03:49.095 --> 03:51.359
I'm going in?
You're going in.

03:55.301 --> 03:57.963
Has anyone ever told you
you look amazing
in that color?

03:59.172 --> 04:01.436
Why do I have the feeling
you're about to?

04:01.507 --> 04:03.634
What do you call
that color, anyway?

04:03.710 --> 04:05.837
Um... Blue.

04:08.047 --> 04:10.174
Well, blue
really suits you.

04:10.950 --> 04:14.010
Briefing time, kids.
You do not want
to miss this one.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.714
Why are you so happy?
I'm going to Datatech.

04:16.789 --> 04:17.880
Data what?

04:17.957 --> 04:20.255
Datatech. It's a computer
security conference.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.556
It's like Comic-Con
for nerds.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.497
Isn't that
just Comic-Con?

04:25.565 --> 04:27.157
Oh, har.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.430
A couple of years ago,
some National
Security genius

04:30.503 --> 04:34.030
decided it would be
a good idea to sit down
with the black-hat types.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.372
Now, twice a year,
a thousand hackers
converge on Washington,

04:37.443 --> 04:39.968
and a thousand
law-enforcement types
pick their brains,

04:40.046 --> 04:42.173
and in many cases,
hire them.

04:42.248 --> 04:44.011
What...
And this has him
wound up because...

04:44.250 --> 04:45.649
He's a dork.

04:46.152 --> 04:47.141
And it was his cover.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.687
Oh, and it will be again.

04:50.523 --> 04:53.356
This morning,
a well-coordinated
cyber attack

04:53.493 --> 04:56.690
took down several
communication systems
in the D.C. area.

04:56.763 --> 04:59.994
It also briefly disrupted
our secure satellite link.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.767
The hack is reminiscent
of a 2007 event

05:02.835 --> 05:05.633
that temporarily
disabled phone service
to the Pentagon.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.674
But this one takes advantage
of a security flaw
we've never seen before.

05:08.741 --> 05:11.608
The Pentagon
believes that select
government servers

05:11.678 --> 05:13.236
may be susceptible
to this hack.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.440
Isn't cyber-crime
FBl territory?

05:15.515 --> 05:17.881
Cyber-crime is.
Cyber-terrorism is not.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.609
Everyone's going to
want a piece of this one.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.746
Spy agencies, terror groups,
organized crime...

05:22.855 --> 05:24.015
So, who do we think
did the hack?

05:24.090 --> 05:27.457
We've been analyzing
the code, and a familiar
name has popped up.

05:30.229 --> 05:33.392
Wow. You're going
to find this interesting.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.591
What?

05:35.134 --> 05:36.123
No.

05:37.136 --> 05:38.125
No.

05:38.204 --> 05:39.603
Natasha Petrovna...
Yes.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.299
...appears to be
behind the attack.

05:41.474 --> 05:42.532
What is it?

05:42.608 --> 05:45.702
Natasha Petrovna
is my ex-girlfriend.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.985
Natasha Petrovna,
born and raised
in Saint Petersburg.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.511
Graduate degree
in computer security
from Lomonosov University.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.559
Now, a member
of the Swedish-founded
Pirate Bureau.

06:33.626 --> 06:34.991
A card-carrying anarchist.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.961
Barber from Tech lntel
will fill you in.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.230
Natasha was busted
two years ago

06:39.298 --> 06:41.698
for illegally accessing
Department of Agriculture
servers.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.429
She was demonstrating
a firewall hack.

06:43.669 --> 06:44.693
There was
no further intent.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.500
Uh, Justice Department
didn't think so.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.006
She just spent two years
at Danbury Women's
Correctional Center.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.300
I'm well aware.

06:50.376 --> 06:53.436
That's where Martha Stewart
did her time.
That's pretty good company.

06:53.513 --> 06:56.380
It seems that Miss Petrovna
is back to her old ways.

06:56.449 --> 07:00.044
The infection vectors
from this morning's hack
were classic Petrovna.

07:00.119 --> 07:02.314
Elegant,
efficient and pointed.

07:02.388 --> 07:03.855
That's Natasha,
all right.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.788
Auggie, we're sending you
to Datatech

07:05.858 --> 07:09.055
to reunite with Natasha
and negotiate
a consulting deal.

07:09.128 --> 07:10.186
We're going
to pay her off?

07:10.263 --> 07:12.390
We're the only
government agency
who can.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.864
We'll go as high
as two million.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.333
Natasha's father was
a political prisoner
under Brezhnev.

07:16.402 --> 07:17.994
She hates the government.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.368
If we try to pay her off,
she's only going
to stonewall us more.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.204
Well, we've had
very good luck at
this agency using money

07:23.276 --> 07:25.836
to get people to
re-examine their ideals.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.411
Annie, you're going
to be his eyes.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.506
Datatech is already underway.
There's not a moment to lose.

07:32.852 --> 07:36.447
Joan? You know that
putting me on this mission
is a bad idea.

07:36.522 --> 07:38.183
It's not going
to make Natasha
any more cooperative.

07:38.257 --> 07:39.519
You're the one
who wanted back
into the field.

07:39.592 --> 07:42.186
If we buy this tech,
she's going to learn
I'm ClA.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.484
Yeah.

07:43.563 --> 07:45.087
You're kidding.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.561
Two years ago,
I can't say anything,

07:47.633 --> 07:49.931
and now I'm just supposed
to announce that I'm a spy?

07:50.002 --> 07:51.902
Look.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.032
I know this isn't easy.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.504
But you of all people
know how hard it is

07:55.575 --> 07:56.940
to get a hold of
technology like this.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.670
We really need this hack.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.383
Hey. Before I forget,
I found some pictures of you
up on the lnternet.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.753
What, so you've got an
Annie Walker Google alert now?

08:10.823 --> 08:12.484
Are you cyber-stalking me?

08:13.292 --> 08:15.590
Actually, Personnel
sent me the link.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.323
They'd like you
to take them down
for security purposes.

08:21.601 --> 08:22.693
Oh.

08:22.869 --> 08:23.927
But I do like this one.

08:25.805 --> 08:27.363
Auggie,
are you ready to go?

08:27.773 --> 08:31.004
I guess. I've got to
stop at home and change.
Can you drive?

08:32.378 --> 08:34.903
How serious was it
with this Natasha girl?

08:35.414 --> 08:36.403
We had fun.

08:37.616 --> 08:40.245
Because you're
the good-time guy.

08:40.318 --> 08:41.308
What's that?

08:42.255 --> 08:43.517
Nothing.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.618
Solo board game?

08:49.228 --> 08:53.028
Don't touch that.
I'm playing an lnternet game
with a girl from Brazil.

08:53.766 --> 08:56.428
Well, at least I think
she's a girl.

08:57.036 --> 09:00.335
At least I think
it's Brazil. You ready?

09:00.406 --> 09:04.137
Where did you
get that? 1986?

09:04.710 --> 09:07.975
Datatech has something
of an unofficial dress code.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.775
You can always tell
the type of person
you're dealing with

09:12.852 --> 09:14.114
based on their look.

09:14.453 --> 09:18.719
Hackers are the ones
in T-shirts with no sense
of personal hygiene.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.554
The more employable variant
is the security consultant,

09:21.627 --> 09:25.222
whose workplace-required
collared shirts usually
feature short sleeves,

09:25.298 --> 09:26.765
so they can show off
their body art

09:26.832 --> 09:29.096
in defiance of the
corporate overlords.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.601
Blue jackets and khakis
are always law enforcement.

09:31.671 --> 09:34.139
The Bureau has never been
known for their subtlety.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.641
What about $1,000 suits
and silk ties?

09:37.710 --> 09:40.770
Europeans. They never
really got nerd fashion.

09:42.014 --> 09:45.415
The FBI does not
like to comment on
ongoing investigations.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.844
But in general,
I can tell you
that we are in...

09:47.920 --> 09:49.615
Who are these guys
on stage?

09:49.689 --> 09:51.884
Used to be
FBl's most wanted.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.448
Now, they're
Datatech celebrities.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.184
...you asked about.
The copyright holder
is a US corporation...

09:56.262 --> 10:01.222
Doesn't it strike you as odd
how many criminals are able
to just exist here?

10:01.300 --> 10:03.268
Not exist, thrive.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.964
This is the Wild West
of the information age.

10:06.038 --> 10:07.300
You think Billy the Kid
and Pat Garrett

10:07.373 --> 10:09.307
didn't sit down
for a sarsaparilla
once in a while?

10:10.276 --> 10:11.607
Does that
answer your question?

10:13.813 --> 10:16.111
My question is
for Mr. Phillips.

10:16.816 --> 10:20.047
How can the FBI defend the
warrantless wiretap program

10:20.119 --> 10:22.644
while at the same time
claiming a need for secrecy

10:22.722 --> 10:24.747
to avoid the Freedom
of Information Act?

10:25.591 --> 10:27.616
Shouldn't access
go both ways?

10:27.693 --> 10:28.955
Well, first,
you have to remember that...

10:29.028 --> 10:30.586
Natasha, right?
Yeah.

10:30.663 --> 10:31.994
...at the time,
the warrantless
wiretap program

10:32.064 --> 10:34.794
had been authorized
by a federal judge.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.835
The purpose for the...
She's pretty.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.233
...is not,
as people think...
Yeah.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.204
...Iistening in on
everyone's phone calls.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.672
We were trying to catch
some very real bad guys...
Are you all right?

10:42.742 --> 10:43.800
Yeah, I'm fine.
...by tapping into
their phones.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.607
That was just one
of the few methods
that we used to...

10:46.912 --> 10:48.470
She's talking
to the Europeans.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.614
It doesn't seem friendly.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.878
They're probably offering
her money, as well.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.613
Then, we should change
our strategy.

10:54.687 --> 10:55.779
Yeah.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.082
Take me over there.
Wait.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.480
What?

11:00.459 --> 11:01.517
She's right in front of you.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.226
Hold up, Tash.

11:20.112 --> 11:22.239
Didn't see that coming.
You should have.

11:22.314 --> 11:23.906
Do you know what I've been
through the last two years?

11:23.983 --> 11:25.575
No, I meant
because I'm blind.

11:25.651 --> 11:26.640
Huh?

11:28.454 --> 11:29.853
Oh, I'm...

11:30.589 --> 11:31.886
I'm so sorry, Auggie.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.221
No, it's not your fault.
I buried the lead.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.355
How are you?

11:40.633 --> 11:41.930
This isn't fair.

11:42.001 --> 11:43.593
You can't come here
after what you did to me

11:43.669 --> 11:45.068
and expect me to
feel sorry for you.

11:45.137 --> 11:47.605
I don't want anyone
to feel sorry for me.
I just want to talk to you.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.902
I sat there, Auggie.

11:49.975 --> 11:52.944
I sat there at Kinkead's
waiting for you,
and you never showed.

11:53.345 --> 11:56.337
Two days later,
I was arrested by the FBl.
It was a hell of a week.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.883
I can explain.
Don't bother.
I'm walking away now.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.278
Tash, please.
I know you were behind
that hack today.

12:02.354 --> 12:03.685
I want in.

12:07.359 --> 12:08.451
Not here.

12:11.363 --> 12:13.923
Who is she,
your seeing-eye dog?

12:15.067 --> 12:18.264
Natasha, this is
my business partner,
Annie Walker.

12:19.472 --> 12:23.670
Don't be fooled by his act.
He's a good hacker,
lousy boyfriend.

12:24.310 --> 12:27.939
I can assure you
our relationship is
purely professional.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.002
Define professional.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.676
The kind of
professionalism that
can offer you $2 million.

12:34.987 --> 12:36.386
I can't believe you don't
know me well enough

12:36.455 --> 12:37.922
to know I'm not interested
in money.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.185
I have to ask
for my company.

12:41.927 --> 12:45.863
Tell your company
they can have
my code tomorrow

12:45.931 --> 12:48.161
when I release it wide
at noon.

12:49.001 --> 12:51.526
No group, no person
should get to
control information

12:51.604 --> 12:54.334
any more than they should
control all the world's
oil or food.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.033
You know
that's simplistic, Tash.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.100
There are groups in there
that want to de-stabilize
personal security,

12:59.178 --> 13:00.907
government security...
It would be chaos.

13:00.980 --> 13:04.074
I'll turn over my code
when your company releases
its copyrights.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.511
That's not the kind
of company I work for.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.954
What do you mean?

13:13.492 --> 13:14.720
I'm ClA.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.360
Always have been.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.162
I'm sorry.
I couldn't tell you
until now.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.814
Well, that could have
gone better.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.691
So, Natasha was just
someone you had fun with
back in the day.

13:47.793 --> 13:51.490
No.
Maybe I undersold
the relationship a little.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.122
You think?

13:53.766 --> 13:58.203
Four years ago,
I was breaking in my cover,
talking tech to random people.

13:59.171 --> 14:03.039
So, I was in a Laundromat
in Adams-Morgan,

14:03.409 --> 14:07.243
and Natasha was reading
Snow Crash while she waited
for her whites.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.706
We dated a little
over a year.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.842
And I wish I hadn't liked
that book so much.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.649
So, you broke her heart.

14:17.723 --> 14:19.384
I didn't want to.

14:20.659 --> 14:22.092
I loved her.

14:24.763 --> 14:25.991
I'm not buying it.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.056
You don't break up
with someone you're
in love with.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.397
You know what?
When you work at the ClA,
you do.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.170
I put in for a close
and continuing
with a foreign national,

14:33.239 --> 14:35.400
and the Agency told me
to cut off all contact.

14:35.474 --> 14:38.841
Well, I can't imagine
they'd be too happy about you
dating a Russian anarchist.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.310
Well, I knew
she was rebellious.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.869
I just didn't know
how rebellious.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.040
The FBl had her in a sting.

14:44.850 --> 14:46.681
Which is why she thinks
you abandoned her.

14:46.752 --> 14:47.912
I did.

14:48.587 --> 14:51.215
All I wanted to do
was protect her,
and I couldn't.

14:58.297 --> 14:59.389
We made contact.

14:59.999 --> 15:03.560
Natasha was unresponsive
to our initial offer.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.537
"Epic fail" would be
a better term.

15:06.772 --> 15:07.830
Told you she hated me.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.535
Auggie, she doesn't
hate you. If anything,
she still loves you.

15:10.609 --> 15:13.043
You don't get that
passionate about someone
if you don't love them.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.908
Ah.

15:15.514 --> 15:18.176
Dude, a blind guy
works here.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.948
Don't rearrange
the furniture.

15:20.019 --> 15:21.884
Sorry about that.
I've got it.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.254
Natasha's
going to release
the hack tomorrow.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.021
Everyone at the
conference knows.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.823
Yeah. And everyone
at that conference
will know

15:30.896 --> 15:32.727
how to do major
damage immediately.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.823
All right.
So, this needs
to happen fast.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.366
Auggie, you're going back
in there tomorrow.

15:37.202 --> 15:39.397
Am I the only one
paying attention here?

15:39.471 --> 15:41.166
Natasha won't negotiate
with me.

15:42.374 --> 15:43.568
Guys, can we have the room?

15:51.583 --> 15:56.520
Auggie. You know this.
People can be turned
for three reasons.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.886
Money, patriotism or love.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.989
I'm not sure
she loves me anymore.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.124
This isn't about her feelings.
It's about yours.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.464
If you do still care
for Natasha,

16:09.535 --> 16:12.595
then you know that
what I'm asking you to do
is the right thing for her.

16:15.708 --> 16:16.697
Auggie?

16:18.911 --> 16:20.037
Yeah.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.338
Okay. I'm your man.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.158
Oh, come on.

16:47.573 --> 16:48.597
Rough day?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.801
Like you read about.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.173
How can working at a museum
be so stressful?

16:54.146 --> 16:56.842
It's not the work.
It's the people.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.181
One of my co-workers there,

17:03.122 --> 17:05.920
I met his
ex-girlfriend today.

17:05.991 --> 17:08.425
She is nothing at all
like I expected.

17:08.493 --> 17:09.983
She's like

17:11.262 --> 17:12.320
chaos in a bottle.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.364
You sound jealous.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.127
Hardly.
I feel sorry for her.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.999
I think this guy's
more of a player
than I originally thought.

17:19.070 --> 17:20.299
So now you take
an interest?

17:20.372 --> 17:21.430
No, it's just...

17:21.839 --> 17:23.967
He's definitely sleeping
with someone he hasn't
told me about.

17:24.510 --> 17:25.738
You know when you think
you know someone,

17:25.978 --> 17:28.344
and then you find out they
have this whole other life?

17:31.950 --> 17:32.939
This is really good.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.519
Speaking of which,
check this out.

17:43.929 --> 17:44.953
Oh.

17:47.132 --> 17:48.690
I know you're going
to hate me,

17:48.767 --> 17:50.701
but I need you to take
those photos down.

17:51.036 --> 17:55.268
What? You know how hard
it was for me to get these.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.968
I know. It's just...

17:58.644 --> 18:01.408
I want the people at work
to think of me
as professional.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.552
Do you have to knock over
everybody's sand castle?

18:07.986 --> 18:10.386
The site isn't about you,
Annie. It's about food.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.219
Um...
And not professional?

18:13.959 --> 18:15.392
Uh...
Wow.

18:16.295 --> 18:17.421
Fine.

18:20.499 --> 18:21.761
Stupid computer.

18:29.208 --> 18:33.304
Sorry. I'm almost ready.
There's fresh coffee
if you want some.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.940
Well, I had a crappy night,
so I hope you're
in a better mood today.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.780
Let's just get this
over with.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.453
AUTOMATED VOlCE
Liza Hearn.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.449
Liza Hearn.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.860
Liza Hearn.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.295
Liza Hearn.

18:57.202 --> 19:00.000
Auggie, please tell me
that you're not so pissed
about this assignment

19:00.072 --> 19:01.937
that you called Liza Hearn.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.937
I didn't. I swear.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.209
We're dating.

19:17.689 --> 19:18.678
You're the leak.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.124
Come on, Annie.
You know me better than that.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.593
Do l?

19:23.662 --> 19:25.459
Up until yesterday,
I had no idea you were...

19:25.531 --> 19:27.123
I'm running an op on her.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.429
I'm working her to
get to her source.

19:29.768 --> 19:31.998
Does...
Does Joan know?

19:32.070 --> 19:34.561
No. If she knew,
she'd farm it out.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.870
According to the NCS,
I'm not fit for fieldwork.

19:36.975 --> 19:38.203
You've got to report it,
Auggie.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.677
This is the woman
who is trying to
destroy the Agency.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.543
Why? So she can give it
to Jai?

19:46.852 --> 19:49.821
James Bond was a lonely,
sad, old man.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.384
What does that mean?

19:53.458 --> 19:55.619
It means I can't believe
you're the kind of guy

19:55.694 --> 19:57.992
who would exploit
a woman for intel.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.828
What do you think
I'm supposed to do
with Natasha?

20:26.124 --> 20:27.489
I'm here.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.025
You happy?

20:32.464 --> 20:34.022
Thank you for meeting me.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.630
So, where is your
all-seeing ClA?

20:37.436 --> 20:39.301
They're right here.

20:47.045 --> 20:49.206
Tash, I know you don't have
any reason to trust me.

20:50.349 --> 20:53.250
But you have to know,
I never wanted to
break up with you.

20:53.318 --> 20:54.512
The ClA made me do it.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.218
So, they control
your love life, too?

20:57.289 --> 20:58.278
I'm not going to defend it.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.052
Leaving you was
the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.287
Wow. So, you're the victim.

21:02.527 --> 21:04.085
Tash, I almost quit
the Agency.

21:05.497 --> 21:06.828
When they told me
I couldn't see you again,

21:06.898 --> 21:09.526
the only thing I could do
was get as far away
from here as possible.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.597
I went to lraq,

21:11.970 --> 21:14.165
and six months later,
I was blind.

21:14.239 --> 21:15.934
We shouldn't be listening.

21:16.341 --> 21:19.208
I know Auggie is a friend,
but today, he's an op.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.041
He knows we're here.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.580
He could be lying to her.

21:28.353 --> 21:32.289
Blue blazers and khakis.
FBl's making a move.

21:33.859 --> 21:36.419
Heads up, Auggie.
FBl, your three o'clock.

21:38.196 --> 21:39.254
Tash, I don't want you
to freak out,

21:39.331 --> 21:41.356
but we have FBl agents
across the street
coming this way.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.401
What did you do?
I had nothing
to do with this.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.494
But as long as you're with me,
they won't do anything.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.903
If you walk away,
I can't protect you.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.374
So, this isn't a negotiation.
You're here to dictate terms.

21:51.443 --> 21:52.774
I want you to do
the right thing.

21:53.078 --> 21:54.409
Sorry, Auggie.

21:54.546 --> 21:56.480
Tash...

21:58.450 --> 21:59.439
Tash!

22:01.186 --> 22:02.175
Give me your hand.

22:02.554 --> 22:03.578
Now! Now!

22:11.997 --> 22:13.658
- Auggie?
- Tash?

22:13.965 --> 22:15.330
Auggie?
Are you hurt?

22:15.400 --> 22:16.628
Tash?

22:17.135 --> 22:18.227
Tash!
Are you okay?

22:18.303 --> 22:20.294
Are you okay?
Uh, yeah,
I'm fine.

22:20.372 --> 22:21.896
Tash! Where did she go?

22:21.973 --> 22:23.440
I don't see her.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.045
What do you mean
she disappeared?

22:30.415 --> 22:32.474
I pulled her away
from the car,
she let go of my hand,

22:32.551 --> 22:33.677
and she was gone.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.219
Okay.
So, what have we got?

22:35.287 --> 22:40.384
Okay. Police found the SUV
abandoned at a bus stop
about a mile from the hotel.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.359
Traffic cams photographed
these two.

22:45.330 --> 22:47.127
Those are the guys
from the conference.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.723
They were the ones
arguing with Natasha.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.768
That's Alexander Markov
and Yuri Tretiak.

22:50.836 --> 22:53.862
These guys are career
criminals with ties to
the RBN crime syndicate.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.931
Makes sense.
Cyber-crime's evolving.
It's Mafia 2.0.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.901
Damn it. Organized crime
is FBl territory.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.779
Okay. Package up
what we have
and send it to them.

23:02.948 --> 23:04.506
God, I hate playing
second chair.

23:04.583 --> 23:05.572
What about Natasha?

23:05.684 --> 23:07.549
The FBl are going to
have to deal with that
when they find her.

23:07.853 --> 23:09.753
FBl? She's in danger.

23:09.821 --> 23:10.810
She's not our problem anymore.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.481
I told her
we'd protect her.

23:12.624 --> 23:16.720
The Bureau is telling
everyone that ClA interfered
with an investigation.

23:17.028 --> 23:18.620
We've played our cards.
It's over.

23:18.897 --> 23:22.731
So, this is how it goes?
Natasha gets the screw again

23:22.968 --> 23:25.061
because of an inter-agency
pissing match?

23:27.139 --> 23:29.130
Boy, I love my job.

23:51.329 --> 23:54.958
As a security professional,
I would advise you
to change the locks

23:55.033 --> 23:57.365
after you dump a girl
who has your house key.

23:58.403 --> 24:00.166
Jesus, Natasha.

24:00.238 --> 24:01.933
Who was in the car?
What?

24:02.207 --> 24:03.572
Was it ClA?

24:04.009 --> 24:06.569
No, of course not.
It was the Russian mob.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.237
Oh, God.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.205
What did you do?

24:13.285 --> 24:18.450
Before I lived here,
before I was Pirate Bureau,
in university in Moscow,

24:19.391 --> 24:20.915
there were these guys.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.190
They had flashy clothes,
lots of money.

24:24.696 --> 24:26.687
At first,
it was nothing.

24:26.765 --> 24:28.699
Translating bits of code
for them.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.531
But then, they drew you in.
First, with money.
Then, with threats.

24:31.603 --> 24:33.867
Ever since then,
everything I do,

24:34.105 --> 24:35.436
they think they have
a piece of.

24:35.574 --> 24:37.940
And they want you
to turn over the hack
only to them.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.342
They feel they own me.

24:40.846 --> 24:42.245
Own my code.

24:43.849 --> 24:47.580
They said they would kill me
if I didn't turn it over.

24:48.186 --> 24:50.086
When they saw me
talking with you...

24:50.155 --> 24:52.749
Jesus, Tash.
You're in danger.
Let me take you in.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.088
No. ClA got me into this.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.493
Those mob guys will not stop
until they get the hack.

24:58.563 --> 24:59.791
The ClA can protect you.

25:00.532 --> 25:04.127
You act so self-righteous,
but what makes you different
from the mobsters?

25:04.336 --> 25:06.804
You both want
to control the code
that I wrote.

25:07.739 --> 25:08.763
You have to trust someone.

25:08.974 --> 25:11.704
I trust the world.
That's why I want
to release the hack.

25:11.776 --> 25:14.176
Trusting everyone is
the same as trusting no one.

25:14.246 --> 25:18.307
Trust? Hmm.
It's not easy, Auggie.

25:19.117 --> 25:20.709
And yet, you're here.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.326
Maybe he's just hungover.
Sleeping it off.

25:32.664 --> 25:34.359
This is a guy who is
never late for anything.

25:34.432 --> 25:36.923
He knows the protocol.
Auggie would have called in.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.169
So, what are you thinking?

25:48.213 --> 25:49.407
Auggie?

26:03.495 --> 26:04.985
Well, that's not Auggie's.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.134
A train? Really?

26:12.103 --> 26:14.537
Are you trying to make this
as annoying as possible?

26:17.275 --> 26:18.606
Oh. Step.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.512
You don't like being
stuck on the rails?

26:24.583 --> 26:28.451
I remember us having
an amazing time on
the Metro to Crystal City.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.855
We weren't running
for our lives.

26:31.923 --> 26:32.912
We are now.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.694
What do you mean
he's out of pocket?

26:37.996 --> 26:39.190
Auggie's not
at his apartment,

26:39.264 --> 26:41.232
and it looks like
Natasha Petrovna was.

26:41.299 --> 26:44.132
Okay. I'm attempting to trace
the last known location
of his cell phone.

26:44.569 --> 26:46.196
Don't bother.
It's right here.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.905
Along with his keys
and his lD.

26:48.073 --> 26:51.008
Anything we could use
to trace them is right here
in front of us.

26:51.076 --> 26:52.441
Look, Auggie knows
what he's doing.

26:52.510 --> 26:53.568
We're not going
to find them unless he...

26:53.645 --> 26:56.978
DHS flags all cash
transactions for
transit tickets, right?

26:57.515 --> 26:58.504
Yeah.

26:59.317 --> 27:02.377
I need you guys
to check all the stores
around Auggie's apartment.

27:02.454 --> 27:06.481
See if any of them activated
a high-value disposable
credit card last night.

27:07.525 --> 27:08.549
Barber, are you there?

27:09.027 --> 27:11.018
Yeah. I'm typing.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.659
Oh, okay.
Okay, here we go.

27:13.732 --> 27:15.791
The, uh, Gas-N-Sip
at 18th and Calvert

27:15.867 --> 27:19.064
activated two $500 cards
last night at 1:16 a.m.,

27:19.137 --> 27:22.800
and one of them was
used to buy tickets
on Amtrak 331 2

27:22.874 --> 27:24.774
to Montreal this morning.

27:36.021 --> 27:38.649
Find a table
near the middle.
I need to hear.

27:38.723 --> 27:40.520
I still don't know
what you're looking for.

27:40.592 --> 27:44.688
I'm looking for a passenger
with a NEXUS immigration
fast-pass card.

27:44.763 --> 27:48.255
Digital documents are
easier to fake than paper.
Here?

27:48.600 --> 27:52.161
I'll just hack
into the passenger manifest.
It will be so much easier.

27:52.237 --> 27:56.173
What? No. Tash. Tash.
I don't need the data.
I need an actual card.

27:56.307 --> 27:58.969
We'd be better
going bag to bag
to find the card.

27:59.077 --> 28:01.875
What, and a blind guy
and a smoking hot
Russian girl

28:01.946 --> 28:05.074
Iooking through other
people's bags wouldn't
attract any attention?

28:05.650 --> 28:09.108
It's better than you trying
to divine a card using ESP.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.818
So, are you going
to give me this hack?

28:14.426 --> 28:15.415
Is that what this is?

28:16.227 --> 28:18.252
You're playing me
to get my code for the ClA?

28:18.329 --> 28:19.387
No, I'm trying to help you.

28:19.597 --> 28:22.566
But I do still think
you'd be better off
entrusting it to the ClA

28:22.634 --> 28:23.692
rather than everyone
in the world.

28:23.768 --> 28:26.134
And for you?
Chef's special
with a side of back bacon.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.468
All right.
And can I get
another serviette?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.440
You bet.
Oh, and separate
receipts, please.

28:30.508 --> 28:32.703
Yes.
That guy.
What is he wearing?

28:32.777 --> 28:34.301
Green tie. Ugly shirt.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.811
And what does that tell you?

28:35.880 --> 28:38.178
He's a businessman
with no style?

28:38.249 --> 28:39.876
No. He's a
Canadian businessman.

28:39.951 --> 28:42.419
An American would have
ordered ham or Canadian bacon.

28:42.487 --> 28:45.786
He ordered back bacon
and she asked for a serviette.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.455
Take me over there
and follow my lead.

28:56.167 --> 29:00.160
Excuse us, folks. We're
with the transit company's
hospitality department,

29:00.238 --> 29:03.435
and we're conducting
a survey to try and improve
our level of service.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.500
Would you mind answering
a couple of questions?

29:05.577 --> 29:07.738
We'd be happy to.
Oh, great. Thank you.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.973
Okay, first question.
On a scale from one to eight,

29:11.082 --> 29:13.778
how would you rate your
travel experience thus far?

29:13.852 --> 29:16.013
Next stop, Albany.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.281
Eight.
Yeah. It's been great.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.550
Wonderful.
I'm very happy
to hear that.

29:20.725 --> 29:22.920
The FBl is stopping
the train at Albany.

29:22.994 --> 29:25.292
I think Auggie wants us,
not the FBl, to find him.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.593
How else do you explain
the Scrabble board
and the credit card scraps?

29:27.665 --> 29:28.723
Those are breadcrumbs.

29:28.833 --> 29:30.824
Or he could have
just been sloppy.

29:31.136 --> 29:32.626
I think he's
running Natasha.

29:32.837 --> 29:34.168
Or he's helping her
get to Canada.

29:34.272 --> 29:35.296
Do you really think that?

29:35.573 --> 29:37.598
Annie, you've only been here
for a few months.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.142
How well do you
really know Auggie?

29:39.210 --> 29:42.179
Okay. Regardless
of which one
of you is right,

29:42.247 --> 29:43.839
we need to get to him
before the FBl does.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.940
They're still furious at us
for losing Natasha.

29:46.217 --> 29:47.809
I want you two
to follow this down.

29:47.886 --> 29:49.854
Got it. We'll liaise
with the Albany office.

29:49.921 --> 29:51.946
No. We're going
to keep this in-house.

29:53.658 --> 29:55.387
Go to the airfield.

30:12.076 --> 30:13.634
No sign of the girl?

30:13.711 --> 30:15.736
I had my NEXUS card
when we got on the train.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.009
Somebody must
have stolen it.

30:18.249 --> 30:20.046
This has got ClA
written all over it.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.038
Nice work.

30:43.107 --> 30:45.632
What do you know?
You didn't see anything.

30:45.977 --> 30:47.239
It sounded awesome.

30:47.912 --> 30:49.743
The current generation
NEXUS immigration cards

30:49.814 --> 30:51.543
have a flaw in the way
they were encrypted.

30:52.016 --> 30:55.577
For some reason,
the designers left sequential
register scanning enabled.

30:56.321 --> 30:59.017
If that's the case,
I can parse the
addressable memory

30:59.090 --> 31:02.423
for the encryption key,
and we'll have full
read-write capabilities.

31:02.493 --> 31:04.484
I love it
when you talk dirty.

31:07.332 --> 31:09.129
How did you know
to switch trains?

31:09.200 --> 31:11.134
I've been doing this
a long time.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.726
Protocol makes
people predictable.

31:14.606 --> 31:15.868
You used to be predictable.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.232
Uh, no.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.004
Yes. Yes.

31:20.078 --> 31:22.342
Yes. You were so
buttoned down.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.005
Such a white hat.

31:24.515 --> 31:26.005
What happened?

31:26.451 --> 31:27.941
Something unpredictable.

31:38.696 --> 31:39.856
Smile.

31:58.950 --> 32:01.851
You didn't break up
with me because
the Agency told you to.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.387
Yes, I did.
I can show you the memo.

32:03.454 --> 32:06.218
Oh, please, Auggie.
It's a notorious bureaucracy.

32:06.291 --> 32:09.021
That memo probably came
after you dumped me.

32:14.299 --> 32:16.733
Wow. I thought
I was kidding.

32:17.368 --> 32:19.495
You were the one
who didn't want to
move to D.C.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.868
You didn't want a family.
You didn't want kids...

32:21.940 --> 32:23.134
Here we go.

32:23.207 --> 32:25.539
Yes. Yes, Tash,
here we go.

32:25.810 --> 32:27.744
You come in and talk to me
like I ruined your life.

32:27.812 --> 32:29.211
But dating you wasn't easy.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.271
So, why bother?
Because l...

32:33.685 --> 32:35.448
Because I loved you.

32:36.821 --> 32:38.914
Don't ask me
to explain it.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.623
I didn't know
we had access to a jet.

33:19.797 --> 33:22.027
Why don't we fly this
more often?

33:22.100 --> 33:24.000
Because our title
isn't "Director."

33:24.569 --> 33:28.005
We don't come back
with Auggie, don't count
on flying it again.

33:38.516 --> 33:41.417
He wasn't on the train.
Neither was Natasha.

33:45.490 --> 33:46.718
Look, I know what
you're thinking,

33:47.058 --> 33:49.049
that I'm an asshole
for not trusting Auggie.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.852
So, you're a bit
of a mind reader?

33:52.864 --> 33:56.823
Look, as hard as it may be
for you to believe,
I do like Auggie.

33:57.001 --> 33:59.128
But if I put
my personal feelings
ahead of analysis,

33:59.203 --> 34:00.227
then I'm not doing my job.

34:00.304 --> 34:01.828
I trust Auggie.

34:02.106 --> 34:03.835
And I respect that.

34:04.308 --> 34:06.572
But in our business,
we can't rely on trust alone.

34:06.644 --> 34:07.906
If we're
wrong about Auggie...

34:07.979 --> 34:09.241
I know I'm right.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.905
Let's assume
you are right.

34:12.216 --> 34:15.708
He's running Natasha.
It's still a huge breach
of protocol.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.614
Wait. ClA protocol.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.018
Always travel unpredictably.

34:23.027 --> 34:27.929
Amtrak splits at Albany
to both Montreal and Toronto.

34:27.998 --> 34:29.193
You think they
switched trains?

34:30.368 --> 34:31.460
Yeah.

34:34.839 --> 34:36.466
Do you trust me?

34:39.377 --> 34:41.402
I'll go talk to the pilot.

34:47.885 --> 34:49.181
Please remain
in your compartments

34:49.253 --> 34:52.449
and have immigration documents
ready for Passport Control.

34:52.523 --> 34:54.388
We will be coming
through the cabin.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.399
Here you go.
Thank you.

35:05.303 --> 35:06.429
We're in.

35:23.855 --> 35:26.221
We already showed
our cards.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.259
I'll get rid of them.

35:32.029 --> 35:33.758
Tash. Wait. Wait!

35:39.904 --> 35:41.963
Tash, talk to me.
How many?

35:42.039 --> 35:43.404
How many?

35:43.474 --> 35:44.498
Two!

36:01.559 --> 36:03.720
Tash, hit the lights!
Hit the lights!

36:16.474 --> 36:17.668
Auggie.

36:26.784 --> 36:28.411
Auggie!

36:37.261 --> 36:38.387
Tash?

36:43.367 --> 36:46.336
Get dressed. Fast.
We're going to have to jump.

36:46.404 --> 36:48.668
We're going to jump off
a moving train?

36:48.773 --> 36:52.209
We're slowing down at Niagara-
on-the-Lake for coupling
to the Canadian system.

36:52.276 --> 36:54.870
The FBl will jump on then.
We'll jump off.

36:59.617 --> 37:04.145
Okay. The FBl will
start at the ends
and work their way in.

37:04.355 --> 37:05.947
Do you see anybody
out there?

37:07.892 --> 37:10.053
They're out there.
They're coming.
Good.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.891
They can't set up
on the eastern side
because of the lake.

37:15.866 --> 37:19.859
When you see the ops team
coming in the back door,
that's when we go.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.835
I'm a big girl, Auggie.
I can take it from here.

37:23.441 --> 37:26.035
Tash, I couldn't help
you before.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.804
I am not abandoning
you now.

37:28.879 --> 37:32.781
What if I told you
I couldn't give you the code,
if I didn't have it?

37:32.850 --> 37:34.317
Would you still help me?

37:37.655 --> 37:38.713
Yes.

37:39.557 --> 37:42.117
Yes. I want to help you.

37:43.427 --> 37:45.759
That's the answer
I wanted to hear.

37:51.235 --> 37:53.203
This is the source code.

37:53.738 --> 37:56.434
Everything you need
is right here.

38:12.623 --> 38:14.386
I love you, Auggie.

38:22.166 --> 38:23.394
Natasha!

38:48.859 --> 38:50.292
Auggie?

38:50.928 --> 38:52.054
Annie?

38:52.129 --> 38:53.323
Where's Natasha?

38:53.931 --> 38:56.263
Jai, don't worry.
I got the hack.

38:59.403 --> 39:00.700
Told you.

39:01.706 --> 39:03.173
Hey, did you guys get
to ride on the jet?

39:04.075 --> 39:05.599
Where's the girl?

39:06.744 --> 39:08.609
I didn't see anything.

39:16.954 --> 39:18.546
I know what
you want to hear.

39:19.490 --> 39:23.153
That I knew Natasha
had the hack the whole time
and I was just playing her,

39:23.828 --> 39:26.558
working her like an asset
to get it back.

39:28.065 --> 39:30.033
But the truth...

39:33.003 --> 39:34.470
I don't know.

39:37.074 --> 39:40.441
In order to be a good
operative, you need
to play on emotions.

39:40.511 --> 39:43.776
And sometimes, that
means you have to
become emotional yourself.

39:47.151 --> 39:49.142
Is that a compliment?
It is.

39:50.788 --> 39:53.586
And just for variety,
here's a threat
to go along with it.

39:55.126 --> 39:58.721
Don't ever do
what you did again.

40:02.032 --> 40:04.000
Have you heard from her?

40:05.469 --> 40:06.527
No.

40:08.773 --> 40:11.071
No, I don't imagine
I'll ever talk to her again.

40:23.053 --> 40:24.281
So...

40:26.257 --> 40:27.849
Was it worth it?

40:29.460 --> 40:31.985
I guess I am qualified
for fieldwork after all.

40:33.998 --> 40:35.761
Speaking of which...

40:37.368 --> 40:39.029
I assume you are
elliptically trying to

40:39.103 --> 40:40.866
get me to talk
about Liza Hearn.

40:41.071 --> 40:42.470
What are you going to do?

40:42.740 --> 40:46.232
I'm going to get as much
information as I can, then
turn it all over to Joan.

40:48.345 --> 40:49.710
And then,
I'm going to end it.

40:50.047 --> 40:51.173
Okay?

40:53.684 --> 40:55.743
It's okay with me
if it's okay with you.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.059
I trust you.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.641
Thank you.

41:24.715 --> 41:27.013
You're not such
a bad sister, after all.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.615
I'm sorry.

41:31.922 --> 41:32.911
Let me see.
Let me see.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.082
Okay, here. See,
look what you can do.
