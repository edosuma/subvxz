00:47.422 --> 00:51.509
It is said that blood
is thicker than water.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.636
It is what defines us.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.472
Binds us. Curses us.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.182
Come, my love. Let's go.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.433
Come, Barnabas.

01:00.352 --> 01:05.731
For some, blood means a life
of wealth and privilege.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.317
For others, a life of servitude.

01:09.236 --> 01:13.364
Angelique, how many times
do I have to tell you not to stare at him?

01:13.532 --> 01:15.283
Remember your place.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.412
When I was but a boy...

01:19.580 --> 01:24.333
my father took us to the New World
to expand the Collins family empire.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.920
We brought English industry
to the wilds of Maine...

01:28.338 --> 01:30.506
and built a fishing business...

01:30.674 --> 01:33.467
the likes of which America
had never seen.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.014
A man should take pride in what he builds.

01:38.932 --> 01:44.979
But remember, Barnabas,
family is the only real wealth.

01:48.400 --> 01:53.654
As our business grew,
the town of Collinsport grew with it...

01:53.822 --> 01:57.450
and we decided to put down
permanent roots.

02:04.124 --> 02:08.877
We spent the next 15 years
building our beloved home:

02:09.545 --> 02:11.213
Collinwood.

02:16.053 --> 02:20.723
But not everyone shared
in our family's success.

02:23.518 --> 02:27.521
Let me hear you say
"I love you, Angelique. I want you."

02:33.570 --> 02:34.862
Angelique...

02:35.030 --> 02:37.031
I am sorry, my dear...

02:38.075 --> 02:40.076
but you would be hearing a lie.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.625
Make the high and mighty low

02:47.793 --> 02:51.170
Arrogant creatures, down you go

03:07.771 --> 03:10.773
Convinced my parents'
death was no accident...

03:10.941 --> 03:15.319
I became obsessed with dark magic
and ancient curses.

03:15.487 --> 03:18.614
"Lo! Above the gates of hell..."

03:20.242 --> 03:22.284
he found a single letter.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.621
A letter proclaiming Satan's true name.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.208
"Mephistopheles."

03:31.503 --> 03:36.799
But even then, in the depths
of my grief, not all was darkness.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.553
For I had found my one true love.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.305
Promise we'll be together forever.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.600
God as my witness, Josette...

03:46.768 --> 03:48.769
I swear it.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.988
Of all the servants I could have spurned...

03:59.364 --> 04:01.240
all the hearts I could have broken...

04:01.908 --> 04:04.785
I got the one with the secret.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.455
I got the witch.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.624
If he doth another choose

04:10.792 --> 04:13.419
To lend his heart an eye

04:13.587 --> 04:16.964
Then magic shall the slighted use

04:17.132 --> 04:20.091
So all he loves will

04:21.344 --> 04:22.928
Die

04:24.681 --> 04:26.182
Caught in Angelique's spell...

04:26.349 --> 04:29.393
my beloved Josette wandered
helplessly towards Widow's Hill...

04:29.561 --> 04:33.606
where many a despondent soul
had leapt to their death.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.986
Josette!

05:06.389 --> 05:08.224
Josette.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.688
Help me.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.430
Josette!

06:38.315 --> 06:40.816
What have you done?!

06:47.657 --> 06:50.492
Angelique had cursed me to be a vampire...

06:50.660 --> 06:54.246
so that my suffering would never end.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.266
There's the monster.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.942
Resolved that I would
never belong to her...

07:23.109 --> 07:25.527
Angelique turned the townspeople
against me...

07:25.695 --> 07:29.782
and condemned me to suffer
my anguish alone in the dark...

07:29.950 --> 07:30.991
Let me out!

07:31.159 --> 07:32.284
For all time.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.828
Let me out, I say!

07:36.498 --> 07:38.499
Release me!

08:46.609 --> 08:49.278
Hello. My name is Maggie Ev...

08:58.079 --> 09:01.540
Hello. My name is Victoria Winters.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.168
Please, call me Vicky.

09:48.338 --> 09:52.007
So where are you from, Veronica?

09:52.175 --> 09:55.094
New York. And it's Victoria.

09:55.261 --> 09:59.139
"And it's Victoria." I
love this chick, man.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.475
New York's a trip?

10:01.643 --> 10:02.935
I guess.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.022
What about you?

10:07.190 --> 10:10.275
What brings a New York girl
out to the sticks?

10:13.196 --> 10:15.322
An old friend.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.330
- Be cool.
- Have a nice day.

11:05.498 --> 11:10.085
- Catch you later.
- Take it easy, Veronica.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.668
Hello. I'm Victoria Winters.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.169
Congratulations.

12:35.171 --> 12:39.007
I'm here to see Ms. Stoddard
about the governess position.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.094
Oh, yeah. Been expecting you.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.595
Come on.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.516
Sorry I didn't grab you
down at the station.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.476
Damn wagon's been acting up.

12:49.644 --> 12:53.063
Miss Elizabeth won't spend the money
to get her fixed.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.606
It's beautiful.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.859
A bitch to dust is what it is.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.863
This place was designed
for a staff of a hundred.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.282
Now they got a staff of me.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.326
Me and Mrs. Johnson.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.621
She's about as useful
as a bucket without a bottom.

13:09.789 --> 13:14.042
Still, not every family
has a house like this.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.545
Or a whole town named after them.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.213
Come again?

13:18.715 --> 13:20.549
Collins. "Collinsport."

13:22.343 --> 13:23.635
Never got that.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.721
Who's that?

13:27.015 --> 13:28.557
Barnaby, maybe.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.892
Something with a "Barn" in it.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.145
One of the real important ones
from way back.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.565
Back when they were rich, rich people.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.442
Barnabas.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.070
His name was Barnabas Collins.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.073
And he was the finest man
this family ever knew.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.243
Welcome to Collinwood.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.079
You'll have to imagine us
on a better day.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.416
The house has some 200 rooms...

13:54.584 --> 13:57.753
most closed off to save on heating.

13:58.796 --> 14:02.507
We don't even go in
the old wing any more.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.384
Sit.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.220
There are only seven of us, after all.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.389
My daughter, Carolyn, and I.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.850
My brother, Roger, and his son, David.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.520
Willie, who you've met.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.774
Mrs. Johnson and Dr. Hoffman...

14:18.941 --> 14:23.570
who I suspect is sleeping off
one of her legendary hangovers.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.615
And where is David's mother,
if you don't mind my asking?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.079
Laura was lost at sea...

14:33.122 --> 14:34.539
when David was 5.

14:35.541 --> 14:40.295
He's had a rather difficult time
accepting her passing.

14:41.672 --> 14:45.300
I brought Dr. Hoffman here
to work with him for a month.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.347
That was three years ago.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.435
There are just a few questions,
if you don't mind...

14:55.603 --> 14:57.979
that were not on the application.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.815
Of course.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.071
How do you feel about the president?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.280
Never met him.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.285
The war?

15:12.829 --> 15:14.246
I don't watch television.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.250
Do you think the sexes should be equal?

15:18.709 --> 15:20.335
Heavens, no.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.421
Men would become unmanageable.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.050
I think we'll get along just fine,
Ms. Winters.

15:27.218 --> 15:30.262
Vicky. Please, call me Vicky.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.184
Carolyn.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.523
Carolyn, this is Ms. Winters.

15:41.691 --> 15:45.569
Sick of hanging around your pad

15:46.279 --> 15:47.362
You're from New York?

15:48.239 --> 15:49.281
I am.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.825
What's Manhattan like?

15:51.993 --> 15:53.702
I'm going to live there when I'm 16.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.539
Carolyn has a fantasy
that I'm going to allow this.

15:57.707 --> 16:01.209
And Mother has a fantasy
I won't run away if she doesn't.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.879
So you're here to babysit the loony.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.548
What have I told you
about using that word?

16:07.258 --> 16:08.842
I'm here to teach David.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.385
Good luck.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.054
None of the others
have made it past a week.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.390
Ms. Winters.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.185
Please, call me Vicky.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.414
Chop-chop, Willie, I'm starving.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.752
And God help me
if it's another bone-dry pot roast...

16:45.254 --> 16:46.379
Who's this?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.257
Ms. Winters, this is my brother, Roger.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.886
Roger, Ms. Winters
is to be David's new governess.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.554
Please, call me Vicky.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.098
It's nice to meet you.

16:57.266 --> 17:01.561
Yeah. Yeah. Nice to meet you.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.732
That it's strange

17:06.483 --> 17:08.234
You're a liar.

17:09.569 --> 17:13.615
I can tell, you know.
Just from a person's face.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.117
Yours says:

17:16.993 --> 17:20.204
"I might look sweet and innocent,
but I have secrets.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.458
Secrets that'll make the hairs on your arms
stand straight up."

17:23.626 --> 17:24.876
Leave her be, Julia.

17:26.796 --> 17:27.963
You're the doctor.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.550
Yeah. And you're "the nanny,"
and she's "the bitch."

17:32.969 --> 17:35.178
How do you ever expect us girls
to advance...

17:35.346 --> 17:37.973
if we keep reducing each other
to labels?

17:39.308 --> 17:41.935
So, Vicky, where'd you c...?

17:42.103 --> 17:45.313
Carolyn!
Will you please turn that noise down?

18:09.547 --> 18:10.672
David, this is Vicky.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.758
She's going to be your new governess.

18:13.926 --> 18:14.968
You ruined it!

18:15.803 --> 18:17.178
I was gonna scare her.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.974
Damn it. What have I told you
about cutting holes in the sheets?

18:21.309 --> 18:22.684
Those are Egyptian cotton.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.353
I was gonna scare you.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.730
Were you scared?

18:26.897 --> 18:28.315
Terrified beyond belief.

18:30.484 --> 18:33.528
You don't have to be nice to him
just because he's nuts, you know.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.530
Carolyn...

18:35.740 --> 18:38.783
Carolyn touches herself.
She makes noises like a kitten.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.202
- David.
- You little shit.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.038
Carolyn. Enough, both of you.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.712
If I may, what is the family business?

18:50.880 --> 18:55.717
Seafood, Ms. Winters.
We had a large cannery in town.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.886
We still own a few fishing boats.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.263
Rusty old boats that no one will hire.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.849
And David's mother's at the bottom
with one of them.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.684
Carolyn, go to your room.

19:08.731 --> 19:12.067
Everybody in this house tiptoes
around him, but no one cares how I feel!

19:18.574 --> 19:20.325
She didn't die.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.827
- She can't.
- Enough, David.

19:23.371 --> 19:27.040
Yes, David believes his mother
has some kind of...

19:27.208 --> 19:29.417
cyclical immortality.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.211
Fascinating, really.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.588
I feel her.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.423
She talks to me.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.592
All the time.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.553
Well...

19:41.013 --> 19:43.098
I think ghosts are just people...

19:43.265 --> 19:46.101
who've moved into
a slightly different dimension than ours.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.979
And I think some people just have
antennas strong enough to pick them up.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.275
There's actually scientific evidence
to support...

19:54.443 --> 19:55.944
Thank you, Ms. Winters.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.043
David, you startled me.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.380
Getting ready for Halloween?

20:39.697 --> 20:41.697
He's coming.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.676
We hit something.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.720
Let's dig it out.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.142
Get down here.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.399
What the hell is this?

21:58.567 --> 22:00.693
Think it's a gas main?

22:00.861 --> 22:03.196
Not supposed to be any out here.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.993
You've gotta be shitting me.
Grab me some bolt cutters.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.098
Jesus!

22:34.520 --> 22:35.770
Run!

23:06.594 --> 23:08.636
I am terribly sorry.

23:08.804 --> 23:12.098
You cannot imagine how thirsty I am.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.328
Mephistopheles.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.676
Show yourself, Satan!

23:48.844 --> 23:51.804
Mock me not
with your strange luminance!

24:16.622 --> 24:18.623
Curious terrain.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.048
What is this?

24:27.216 --> 24:29.634
Some specter approaches.

24:30.177 --> 24:33.805
It is the eyes of the devil himself,
come to drag me to my judgment.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.559
Have at me, Lucifer.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.353
My soul is prepared!

24:45.234 --> 24:46.567
Asshole!

26:13.363 --> 26:15.156
My beloved Collinwood.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.284
What have they done to you?

26:28.587 --> 26:31.589
I'll keep on drinking and trust my...

26:31.840 --> 26:33.966
Hi, pumpkin.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.513
Fear me not, drunkard.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.973
You shall not be harmed...

26:41.141 --> 26:43.935
so long as you tell me
all that I need to know.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.189
Well, here's all you need to know.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.859
See me, derelict.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.530
Look into my eyes...

26:55.697 --> 26:59.700
and deliver me
your innermost thoughts.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.458
Awaken.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.669
Well done.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.839
Now, tell me, the Collins family...

27:13.757 --> 27:15.133
do they endure?

27:16.051 --> 27:18.302
A-yuh. There's four of them.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.555
Thank heaven.

27:20.722 --> 27:23.141
Pray, what month is it?

27:23.308 --> 27:26.644
October. That's why there's pumpkins.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.814
- What is the year?
- '72.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.233
Wait. '71.

27:32.401 --> 27:35.069
A-yuh, 1972.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.948
1972?

27:40.951 --> 27:42.577
Hear me, future-dweller.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.038
You shall be my loyal servant...

27:46.206 --> 27:51.377
until such time as I release you.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.257
So, what first, master?

27:56.425 --> 27:59.260
You will cleanse me, miscreant.

27:59.428 --> 28:02.430
And then you will take me
to these living Collinses you speak of.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.682
Okay.

28:13.483 --> 28:17.195
Have you ever seen such majesty?

28:17.362 --> 28:18.446
Every day.

28:18.822 --> 28:22.241
The perfect marriage
of European elegance...

28:22.784 --> 28:25.369
and American enterprise.

28:27.956 --> 28:33.419
Nine of the finest craftsmen
the world will ever know...

28:33.962 --> 28:38.299
lost digit, limb and life...

28:38.467 --> 28:42.136
in the process of carving
these glorious pillars.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.892
And they all considered it
worth the sacrifice, I assure you.

28:48.852 --> 28:53.397
The opulence and complexity
of this magnificent chandelier...

28:54.608 --> 28:58.486
should only be found
in the palaces of nobility.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.073
The fireplace...

29:02.741 --> 29:07.662
sculpted entirely of the most
exquisite Carrara marble...

29:07.829 --> 29:10.790
from Firenze, Italia...

29:11.416 --> 29:16.504
each joint containing a single pearl.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.469
Are you stoned or something?

29:25.180 --> 29:27.640
They tried stoning me, my dear.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.100
It did not work.

29:31.561 --> 29:34.647
When did they start allowing
women of the night on estate grounds?

29:35.190 --> 29:36.440
Carolyn.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.860
- Look.
- Yes.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.029
Uncanny, is it not?

29:42.197 --> 29:44.782
Worth every hour I spent posing.

29:44.950 --> 29:49.787
Forgive me.
My name is Barnabas Collins.

29:50.247 --> 29:53.332
I'm David Collins.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.918
- Are we...?
- Related?

29:56.086 --> 29:57.628
Distantly, you might say.

29:59.172 --> 30:02.717
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Master David.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.343
Children!

30:04.886 --> 30:06.345
Get away from that man.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.473
He says his name is Barnabas Collins.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.684
And I'm pretty sure
he called me a hooker.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.603
That'll do, Carolyn.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.734
A word, please.

30:22.237 --> 30:25.990
If this is some kind of a joke,
consider it played.

30:26.491 --> 30:30.328
If it's money you're after,
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

30:30.495 --> 30:34.206
But whoever you are, you're not to look
at those children again. Am I clear?

30:38.545 --> 30:42.006
Your devotion to family...

30:42.382 --> 30:44.759
is admirable, madam.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.135
And your suspicion...

30:47.804 --> 30:49.513
understandable.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.351
A stranger arrives...

30:53.518 --> 30:56.937
claiming to be a distant relation.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.733
The question of motive
is to be expected.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.614
As a Collins...

31:07.949 --> 31:13.079
surely you are aware of the darkness
that has long plagued our family.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.874
You mean our curse.

31:17.918 --> 31:21.670
Witches, ghosts and vampires.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.673
Myths.

31:26.301 --> 31:30.137
And like so many before you...

31:30.639 --> 31:32.890
I suppose you're here
to rid us of them.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.809
For a price, of course.

31:37.020 --> 31:41.190
- I can prove that I am different.
- Oh?

31:41.942 --> 31:44.610
Firstly, I do not come seeking money.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.279
Rather, to provide it.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.657
Secondly...

31:50.158 --> 31:54.495
I know the body of this mansion
as well as I know my own.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.206
Every nook...

31:57.624 --> 31:59.667
every corner...

31:59.835 --> 32:02.169
every secret!

32:06.800 --> 32:08.801
That's where I keep my macramé.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.930
A disgraceful misuse.

32:14.224 --> 32:15.891
Impressive.

32:17.811 --> 32:21.689
But there are plenty of old houses
with hidden doors.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.692
I hope you have a "thirdly."

32:25.527 --> 32:26.694
Indeed.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.863
Tell me...

32:29.030 --> 32:30.823
what do you know...

32:31.533 --> 32:33.868
of Barnabas Collins?

32:34.035 --> 32:36.203
Just legends, really.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.457
He was confident and strong.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.376
Admired by all.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.920
But he believed our family was cursed...

32:45.088 --> 32:48.591
and when his parents were killed,
he went mad.

32:48.758 --> 32:53.804
Went around insisting that a witch
had turned him into a vampire.

32:54.723 --> 32:57.057
And what is known of his death?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.018
Nothing.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.312
Not that I can think of.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.063
That, madam...

33:03.857 --> 33:05.566
is because he never died.

33:25.128 --> 33:28.839
I am Barnabas Collins.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.429
That means you're...

33:35.597 --> 33:38.974
A vampire, madam. Yes.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.352
And most regrettably so.

33:44.773 --> 33:48.526
But more importantly, I am a Collins.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.611
And I give you my word of honor:

33:51.488 --> 33:58.077
Neither you nor any under this roof
need fear my cursed nature.

34:16.388 --> 34:21.308
My father had quite a flair
for secret passages and rooms.

34:23.353 --> 34:28.357
As a boy, I took it upon myself
to discover each one.

34:28.525 --> 34:29.733
But this one...

34:29.900 --> 34:33.862
This one was always my favorite.

34:34.322 --> 34:40.202
"Family is the only real wealth,"
he would often remark.

34:41.705 --> 34:42.788
Though clearly...

34:43.706 --> 34:47.543
he was not opposed to other kinds.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.505
Oh, my God.

34:52.382 --> 34:56.342
We've been sitting on top of a fortune
all these years.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.889
Know this:

35:01.141 --> 35:03.392
I mean to stay.

35:04.853 --> 35:07.771
I mean to be a part of this family again.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.524
On one condition.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.192
Yes.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.570
Promise me that this...

35:14.738 --> 35:18.616
all of this, will remain our secret.

35:20.535 --> 35:21.994
So be it.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.372
Partners.

35:31.338 --> 35:34.965
Welcome home, Barnabas Collins.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.470
I was awakened...

35:40.013 --> 35:43.557
by a yellow dragon with iron teeth.

35:43.892 --> 35:49.855
Confronted by a giant letter M
with the luminance of a thousand lanterns.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.816
He's not staying with us forever, is he?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.235
I like him.

35:55.820 --> 36:00.074
Yes, well, I'm sure things
are very different in England.

36:00.742 --> 36:04.703
So, Barnabas, what sort of business
are you in back home?

36:04.913 --> 36:09.249
The Collins family has always been
in the fishing business.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.502
But after two centuries
of consideration...

36:11.670 --> 36:15.047
I have decided to devote
the entirety of my energies...

36:15.215 --> 36:18.217
to family.

36:18.927 --> 36:22.513
He means it seemed like two centuries.

36:24.265 --> 36:25.766
Morning.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.397
Who the hell is this?

36:32.357 --> 36:38.195
Dr. Hoffman, this is our distant relative,
Barnabas Collins.

36:38.780 --> 36:40.239
The Third.

36:40.407 --> 36:44.576
Barnabas Collins lll
is going to stay with us from England.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.788
Barnabas? Dr. Julia Hoffman.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.458
My God...

36:51.960 --> 36:54.253
a woman doctor.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.463
What an age this is.

36:58.508 --> 36:59.800
Is he for real?

37:01.177 --> 37:03.637
I think he's just tired from his long trip.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.433
I see that you have grown
desperate enough...

37:07.600 --> 37:10.310
to sell off the prized
family silverware.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.813
How could you tell?
These are exact replicas.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.315
Had this fork been real silver...

37:15.483 --> 37:20.446
my hand would have burst into flames
upon its slightest touch.

37:22.657 --> 37:26.785
Yes, you mentioned
you have a terrible metal allergy.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.874
Anyway, the fishing business
is all but gone.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.793
The manor is nearly in ruins.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.087
Well, I have returned.

37:37.255 --> 37:41.508
And in short order,
so shall our fortunes.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.677
Good luck.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.263
Angie has deals
with most of the boats in Maine.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.348
- "Angie"?
- Angelbay.

37:48.975 --> 37:52.478
They've taken just about every port
on the East Coast.

37:53.021 --> 37:56.190
Then that is where my work begins.
And with your blessing...

37:56.649 --> 38:00.694
I shall restore the family business
to its former glory.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.240
Josette.

38:07.202 --> 38:08.368
That's Vicky.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.537
She believes in ghosts, like me.

38:16.878 --> 38:17.878
Hi.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.049
Enchanted.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.802
Surely you do not let them
call you "Vicky."

38:25.512 --> 38:28.847
A name like Victoria is so beautiful...

38:29.015 --> 38:32.976
I could not bear to part
with a single syllable of it.

38:34.479 --> 38:35.896
Yeah, well...

38:36.564 --> 38:38.816
money might grow on trees
where you're from...

38:38.983 --> 38:41.485
but it's a little
harder to come by here.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.695
Do not concern yourself
with my methods.

38:44.072 --> 38:48.075
I should like to see the factory immediately.
How soon can the horses be ready?

38:48.535 --> 38:50.828
We don't have horses.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.038
We have a Chevy.

38:57.585 --> 39:00.504
Hey, Angie, have a great day!

39:00.672 --> 39:03.549
- Morning, Angie!
- Hi, Angie!

39:03.716 --> 39:05.425
Morning!

39:33.621 --> 39:38.417
One of the seamers blew a clutch.
It'll be two hours before it's back online.

39:38.585 --> 39:41.503
Make it an hour.
And start cracking the whip out here.

39:41.671 --> 39:44.298
Everybody looks like
they're moving at half speed today.

39:44.674 --> 39:48.594
Tell you the truth, I think they're a little
spooked about what happened last night.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.470
- What do you mean?
- Didn't you hear?

39:50.638 --> 39:53.849
They found 11 workers dead in the woods
off Route 9 this morning.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.309
Well, accidents happen.

39:55.476 --> 39:59.855
It wasn't an accident.
Some maniac ripped their throats out.

40:00.940 --> 40:03.150
Where off Route 9?

40:08.448 --> 40:12.159
Yeah, Helen, it's me. Yeah, you heard me right.
It's carnage here.

40:30.637 --> 40:33.805
All right! I heard you the first 20 times.

40:33.973 --> 40:36.099
Keep your damn panties...

40:37.226 --> 40:40.020
- ...on.
- I'll do my best.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.314
A word with Barnabas Collins, please.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.150
Oh, he's... Who?

40:45.318 --> 40:48.028
Oh, I think you know who.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.697
Black hair, handsome features.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.867
Strange clothes covered in fresh blood.

41:00.750 --> 41:06.171
My, we've let this place go to hell,
haven't we?

41:06.339 --> 41:09.549
Right where it belongs.

41:17.225 --> 41:18.684
You must be Carolyn.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.186
You're like a hungry tiger

41:21.354 --> 41:24.815
We're growing into
quite the fetching creature.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.191
Angelique.

41:26.734 --> 41:27.818
Elizabeth.

41:31.698 --> 41:33.240
You're looking well.

41:34.075 --> 41:36.535
And to what do we owe the pleasure?

41:36.786 --> 41:41.999
I'm here on behalf of the town council
to welcome our new visitor to Collinsport.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.835
He's asleep, I'm afraid.

41:45.211 --> 41:48.171
During the day? How odd.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.717
What was that infernal banging?

41:51.884 --> 41:53.719
Barnabas, we have a guest.

41:53.886 --> 41:56.430
My apologies, madam.
I have just arisen.

41:56.973 --> 41:58.765
You must think me a fright. Miss...?

41:59.183 --> 42:00.434
Hello, Barnabas.

42:03.438 --> 42:06.273
My name is Angie Bouchard.

42:07.442 --> 42:09.026
So it is.

42:11.279 --> 42:14.531
Do you know what I would very much
like to do with you?

42:15.324 --> 42:17.409
I can only imagine.

42:18.411 --> 42:21.621
I would very much like to have a word
in the drawing room.

42:21.789 --> 42:25.083
With your permission, Elizabeth.
Would you excuse us?

42:26.085 --> 42:29.838
How dare you defile my manor
with your noxious...?

42:40.099 --> 42:42.392
It's really you.

42:45.021 --> 42:48.648
How dare you place
your wicked lips upon me?

42:48.983 --> 42:51.610
I remember this place
being less depressing.

42:54.155 --> 42:58.200
I also remember the two of us
having a lot of fun.

42:58.367 --> 42:59.409
Here...

43:01.788 --> 43:03.580
and...

43:05.833 --> 43:07.375
here.

43:07.543 --> 43:10.754
Have you any idea
what you put me through?

43:10.922 --> 43:14.925
You killed the woman I love
and cursed me to be this hideous creature.

43:15.093 --> 43:16.843
Barnabas, get over it.

43:17.011 --> 43:19.846
Locked in a box for 200 years!

43:20.014 --> 43:24.184
Don't exaggerate, it was only 196.

43:24.352 --> 43:26.269
It was an eternity.

43:27.688 --> 43:30.982
I shall have you tried for witchcraft
and burnt at the stake.

43:33.319 --> 43:35.529
Poor, sweet Barnabas.

43:35.696 --> 43:39.533
Things have changed
while you were taking your little nap.

43:40.451 --> 43:44.996
My Angelbay is Collinsport now.

43:45.164 --> 43:49.376
So you are the one who has sent
the Collins family business into the abyss.

43:49.544 --> 43:51.253
They love me here.

43:51.420 --> 43:54.965
I'm the only big fish left
in their little pond.

43:55.133 --> 43:56.842
Is that so?

43:57.009 --> 44:00.220
And do the good people of Collinsport
know that their beloved Angie...

44:00.388 --> 44:02.222
is a whore of Beelzebub?

44:02.557 --> 44:06.893
Do you really think anyone
would believe a word you said?

44:07.061 --> 44:10.647
I've been an upstanding member
of this community for 200 years...

44:10.815 --> 44:13.316
in one form or another.

44:13.734 --> 44:18.947
Your name may have changed,
but you remain the succubus of Satan.

44:19.115 --> 44:21.158
Harlot of the devil. Vulgar...!

44:24.704 --> 44:27.414
The people of Collinsport
are my worshippers now.

44:27.832 --> 44:28.915
And to them...

44:29.083 --> 44:32.252
you're just a stranger
who's afraid of the sun.

44:35.464 --> 44:39.593
Welcome back to the shadows,
Barnabas Collins.

44:40.219 --> 44:41.928
I've missed you.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.607
Angelbay.

44:53.941 --> 44:58.278
The very audacity of the name summons
vomit into the recesses of my mouth.

44:58.446 --> 45:03.116
I always knew there was something off
about Angie. But a witch?

45:03.284 --> 45:04.910
Indeed.

45:05.077 --> 45:08.788
But a witch with
an impenetrable hatred of me.

45:09.081 --> 45:10.373
Hate?

45:10.541 --> 45:13.919
No, if she merely hated you,
she would've killed you.

45:14.086 --> 45:17.297
A curse takes devotion.

45:17.465 --> 45:18.924
Why must I alone...

45:19.300 --> 45:23.595
bear the rotten fruit
of our cursed family tree?

45:24.305 --> 45:27.307
My parents, taken.

45:30.645 --> 45:33.980
My true love, taken.

45:35.483 --> 45:36.900
And what did you do?

45:39.403 --> 45:42.489
I attempted to throw myself from a cliff.

45:42.657 --> 45:45.158
Tragically, to no avail.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.118
And then...

45:47.912 --> 45:50.330
I became a vampire...

45:50.957 --> 45:54.626
and started to kill
innocent townspeople.

45:59.465 --> 46:01.007
Yes...

46:01.342 --> 46:04.970
but you also kept
the family business afloat...

46:05.137 --> 46:08.306
and tried to keep the manor
from falling apart.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.768
Yes.

46:12.061 --> 46:13.353
Yes, I did, didn't I?

46:13.521 --> 46:16.815
You fought on, Barnabas.

46:17.358 --> 46:22.529
In your own crazy and miserable way,
you fought on...

46:22.697 --> 46:26.199
until they had to drag you away
and lock you in an iron box...

46:26.367 --> 46:29.035
- ...to keep you from fighting.
- My God, you're right.

46:29.203 --> 46:31.538
You fought on
because it's in your blood.

46:31.706 --> 46:33.999
In our blood, madam.

46:34.166 --> 46:37.210
And now you have a chance
to fight again.

46:38.546 --> 46:41.923
And fight I shall.

48:32.118 --> 48:35.453
Just the same for you and me

48:35.621 --> 48:39.999
All I need will be mine if you are here

48:40.167 --> 48:42.752
I'm on the top of the world looking down

48:43.170 --> 48:46.423
What sorcery is this?

48:48.175 --> 48:51.302
Reveal yourself, tiny songstress!

49:56.952 --> 50:00.205
You want fishermen,
you gotta get Silas Clarney first.

50:00.372 --> 50:03.625
He's got the ear of every captain
from Bar Harbor to Boston.

50:03.792 --> 50:06.920
They call him the
"Godfather of the Grand Banks."

50:07.755 --> 50:10.840
Excuse me. Captain Clarney?

50:14.803 --> 50:19.474
Captain Clarney,
I'd like you to meet Barnabas Collins.

50:21.268 --> 50:22.769
"Collins"?

50:23.229 --> 50:27.273
And why does a Collins
want to talk to me?

50:33.572 --> 50:35.782
To offer you a contract.

50:35.950 --> 50:37.742
I have a contract...

50:38.202 --> 50:39.452
with Angelbay.

50:40.329 --> 50:43.414
And if I told you
I could offer you a better one?

50:43.791 --> 50:49.212
Then, Mr. Collins, I would tell you
to take a long walk off a short pier.

50:49.922 --> 50:54.717
There is such a thing as loyalty
in our line of work.

50:55.970 --> 50:57.470
I see.

50:58.973 --> 51:00.473
Mr. Clarney...

51:03.811 --> 51:06.896
you have grown rather weary
of working for Angelbay.

51:07.982 --> 51:12.402
In fact, you would rather
sell your soul to Satan...

51:13.153 --> 51:15.655
than sell another fish
to Angelique Bouchard.

51:15.823 --> 51:18.157
Do you understand?

51:19.660 --> 51:21.327
I...

51:21.829 --> 51:23.329
understand.

51:23.497 --> 51:25.373
Very good.

51:26.333 --> 51:27.750
Now...

51:28.377 --> 51:30.670
if you would be so kind
as to introduce me...

51:30.838 --> 51:33.339
to some of your fellow captains...

52:34.943 --> 52:38.237
Barnabas? Why are you
staring into Carolyn's room?

52:38.906 --> 52:40.907
What is that thing?

52:41.825 --> 52:43.242
It's a lamp.

52:43.869 --> 52:47.121
It looks like a pulsating blood urn.

52:47.956 --> 52:50.750
I think it's time I showed you
my office, Barnabas.

52:51.377 --> 52:53.878
Do you know what a psychiatrist is?

52:54.046 --> 52:56.422
Regrettably, the word is foreign to me.

52:56.590 --> 53:00.218
May I assume it is some species
of American delicacy?

53:01.220 --> 53:05.264
It's a medical doctor that specializes
in disorders of the mind.

53:05.432 --> 53:08.810
I'm a psychiatrist.

53:09.436 --> 53:12.438
Now, where were you born?

53:13.107 --> 53:16.067
- Liverpool.
- Can you describe it for me?

53:16.235 --> 53:17.777
Filthy.

53:17.945 --> 53:20.279
The air is choked with soot
and the streets reek...

53:20.447 --> 53:22.573
of freshly hurled chamber pots.

53:22.741 --> 53:25.785
The smell of urine permeates the air.

53:28.122 --> 53:30.456
Have you any experience
with hypnotism, Barnabas?

53:31.291 --> 53:33.710
I find it very useful, yes.

53:34.086 --> 53:35.795
Yes, I agree.

53:37.131 --> 53:38.715
You see...

53:39.299 --> 53:44.137
sometimes we make up
a fantasy world...

53:44.304 --> 53:46.973
to help us erase horrible memories
from our past.

53:47.808 --> 53:51.060
I find hypnotism cuts through all that.

53:52.312 --> 53:55.481
I employ it for other purposes.

53:55.899 --> 53:57.900
May I hypnotize you, Barnabas?

53:58.944 --> 54:00.611
Madam...

54:00.779 --> 54:04.490
I do not believe that remotely possi...

54:07.995 --> 54:09.454
Good.

54:12.624 --> 54:14.167
Now...

54:14.626 --> 54:17.253
I'd like you to tell me a few things.

54:19.631 --> 54:20.673
A vampire?

54:21.675 --> 54:24.051
Keep your voice down.

54:24.344 --> 54:26.596
What on earth are you talking about?

54:26.764 --> 54:30.725
Oh, spare me.
I had him under hypnosis for hours.

54:30.893 --> 54:32.351
Barnabas?

54:32.519 --> 54:35.188
There's a point where delusions fail,
but his didn't budge.

54:35.355 --> 54:36.939
He told me everything...

54:37.107 --> 54:39.817
including that you've known
his secret since he arrived!

54:39.985 --> 54:42.779
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I was protecting the children.

54:42.946 --> 54:45.948
Oh, by letting a vampire
use one of the guest bedrooms?

54:46.116 --> 54:48.826
He admitted killing those men
at the construction site.

54:48.994 --> 54:51.496
- He's a murderer.
- He's a Collins and a good man...

54:51.663 --> 54:54.957
and these days,
that's a desperately rare combination.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.835
Oh, yes, I almost forgot,
the family that can do no wrong.

54:58.003 --> 55:00.171
You know, Julia, I'm surprised at you.

55:00.714 --> 55:05.510
I'd think a physician like you
would find him fascinating.

55:06.970 --> 55:08.304
Well, sure.

55:08.472 --> 55:13.476
Medically, psychologically
and physically, he's fascinating.

55:13.852 --> 55:16.896
Which is exactly why I came to you
instead of the police.

55:17.064 --> 55:19.482
Then be fascinated, Julia.

55:20.234 --> 55:24.403
And if you have an ounce of love
or respect for this family...

55:24.571 --> 55:26.405
keep your mouth shut.

55:27.616 --> 55:30.243
I don't feel comfortable
discussing this with you.

55:30.410 --> 55:32.119
Do not fear, my child.

55:32.287 --> 55:36.833
I simply seek advice on the art
of courting a woman of this time.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.042
Land.

55:38.585 --> 55:42.421
And who better to tutor me
than a woman of your age.

55:42.756 --> 55:44.257
What is your age, if I may?

55:45.050 --> 55:48.886
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen and no husband.

55:49.054 --> 55:51.597
You must put those birthing hips
to good use at once...

55:51.765 --> 55:55.101
lest your womb shrivel up and die.

55:55.561 --> 55:56.936
You're weird.

55:57.354 --> 56:01.274
But do you think me too weird
for a woman of this...

56:01.441 --> 56:02.441
land?

56:02.609 --> 56:04.902
You obviously mean Vicky.

56:07.489 --> 56:12.577
She has the most fertile birthing hips
I have ever laid eyes upon.

56:13.453 --> 56:14.954
You're way too weird.

56:15.581 --> 56:16.956
Do you really think so?

56:17.624 --> 56:21.043
You're all stiff, proper and old-fashioned.

56:22.588 --> 56:24.338
And Victoria...

56:25.090 --> 56:27.925
is she not proper?

56:28.468 --> 56:31.679
She likes to pretend she's rock 'n' roll.

56:31.847 --> 56:34.390
She's a Carpenters kind of chick for sure.

56:35.893 --> 56:39.228
Do you mean to say that she has
a penchant for woodworkers?

56:39.396 --> 56:41.564
The Carpenters are musicians, stupid.

56:42.774 --> 56:44.817
Music.

56:44.985 --> 56:49.155
Yes, I'm rather fond
of the music of the day.

56:52.117 --> 56:53.993
I am a picker

56:54.161 --> 56:56.787
I am a grinner

56:56.955 --> 56:58.998
I am a lover

56:59.666 --> 57:03.169
And I am a sinner

57:03.879 --> 57:05.338
I play my music

57:06.673 --> 57:08.049
In the sun

57:11.178 --> 57:13.346
If only Shakespeare
had been as eloquent.

57:13.513 --> 57:15.222
Okay.

57:15.849 --> 57:19.060
If you wanna get with her, you're
gonna have to change your approach.

57:19.227 --> 57:21.562
Drop the whole weird
Swinging London thing...

57:21.730 --> 57:24.106
and hang out
with a few normal people.

57:30.572 --> 57:32.823
You know what's good
about this war, man?

57:32.991 --> 57:34.241
- What?
- No way, man.

57:34.451 --> 57:36.535
No, no, no, listen up.

57:36.703 --> 57:38.704
What's good about this war...

57:38.872 --> 57:40.998
is that it's so bad...

57:41.333 --> 57:43.459
it's gonna be the last one.

57:43.627 --> 57:45.836
- Yeah.
- The last one.

57:46.004 --> 57:49.131
And this last war we're in the middle of...

57:49.591 --> 57:51.467
who wins?

57:54.179 --> 57:57.807
- Peace wins, man.
- Yeah.

57:57.975 --> 58:01.686
- Peace wins every war.
- Yeah.

58:01.853 --> 58:04.438
- Every war.
- Yeah.

58:06.233 --> 58:10.194
- You speak of peace.
- Yeah.

58:12.239 --> 58:16.534
I have spent the last two centuries
locked in a box...

58:18.120 --> 58:20.997
staring into the all-consuming void.

58:21.164 --> 58:25.001
The dark shadows of one's soul.

58:25.919 --> 58:27.420
That's heavy, man.

58:28.296 --> 58:32.842
Man, you tripped for two centuries?

58:33.135 --> 58:34.885
Indeed.

58:35.053 --> 58:37.847
But with great purpose, methinks.

58:38.432 --> 58:43.936
For I believe that I have found
my one true love.

58:45.439 --> 58:47.940
Alas, I know not how to win
her tender affections...

58:48.108 --> 58:52.111
for I fear that I am
a relic in her eyes.

58:52.279 --> 58:54.947
- That's what they say about us.
- Yeah.

58:57.117 --> 58:58.784
Where I'm from...

58:58.952 --> 59:03.289
the love of a woman is won
by giving money to her father.

59:04.791 --> 59:06.834
Or sheep.

59:07.544 --> 59:10.629
And if the love is earnest enough...

59:10.797 --> 59:14.467
then perhaps even
a combination of the two.

59:15.302 --> 59:18.846
Women don't care about money...

59:19.264 --> 59:20.931
or sheep.

59:21.099 --> 59:22.767
Yeah.

59:23.101 --> 59:24.977
Are you absolutely certain?

59:26.480 --> 59:28.230
Love.

59:28.482 --> 59:30.649
Chicks dig love, man.

59:31.610 --> 59:34.111
Yeah.

59:34.279 --> 59:35.696
Yes.

59:35.989 --> 59:37.823
I am reminded of a line...

59:37.991 --> 59:42.495
from Erich Segal's wonderful novel,
Love Story.

59:44.289 --> 59:48.125
"Love means never having to say...

59:48.668 --> 59:50.252
you are sorry."

59:51.004 --> 59:54.423
That is so beautiful.

59:54.591 --> 59:59.970
However, please know
that it is with sincere regret...

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:05.184
that I must now kill all of you.

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:07.520
Yeah.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.032
No, it's brilliant.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:21.867
Theoretically, anyway.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:25.371
A series of transfusions
to try and purify your blood.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:29.083
And my soul with it.

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:34.213
I should warn you, Barnabas,
there's a slight chance it won't work.

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:37.341
It isn't exactly the kind of thing
they teach in medical school.

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.426
You must have faith, doctor...

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:44.098
for if a man can become a monster,
then a monster can become a man.

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:46.225
But why become a man, Barnabas?

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:49.019
Why give up the gift of eternal youth?

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:52.064
Look at me. Every year I get half as pretty
and twice as drunk.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:55.734
If that is true, madam...

01:00:55.902 --> 01:01:01.031
you must have started as the most
beautiful creature that has ever lived.

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:07.913
Barnabas...

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:12.418
are you aware of the concept
of doctor-patient confidentiality?

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.753
No.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:17.423
Perhaps you would be kind enough
to enlighten me.

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:20.926
All right.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.941
Barnabas!

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.277
Victoria.

01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:40.613
Mind if I tag along?

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.073
Nothing would make me happier.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.451
You've come down for a stroll?

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.912
Actually, I came down looking for David.

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.997
God knows where he's run off to now.

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:53.167
We'll be lucky if we see him
before Christmas.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:54.960
He's a fine lad.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:58.547
Every bit as curious and rambunctious
as I was.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:01.300
He idolizes you.

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:05.638
Between you and his mother, I can hardly
get him to talk about anything else.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:11.310
You believe him, that he sees her
and speaks to her?

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:16.899
Part of me believes he's a lonely boy
looking for comfort.

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:21.946
Part of me believes there are things
in this world we don't understand.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:26.867
Things like magic, death, destiny.

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:31.997
I guess as long as it makes him happy,
what does it matter what anyone believes?

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.835
Eloquently put.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.507
Maybe we're getting too worked up
about this, Angie.

01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:44.677
They spruced up the cannery
and renovated their house. So what?

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:49.390
We still hold pink slips on 95 percent
of the nets dragging the Grand Banks.

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:50.766
He's right.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:53.644
It doesn't mean anything
to our bottom line.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:03:01.443
"Doesn't mean anything"?

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.365
My great-great grandmother
started Angelbay...

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:12.246
to show those Collins
that they didn't own the water.

01:03:12.664 --> 01:03:16.458
That they couldn't look down
their entitled noses at us.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:20.170
The Bouchard women slaved
for over two centuries...

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:24.049
sacrificing their lives
to build this business.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.886
So that means something, gentlemen.

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:32.391
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna see it
destroyed by those bastards.

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:37.062
Call and arrange a meeting.

01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:48.240
Sell to you? Never.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:53.412
One cannot put a price on the restoration
of a family's honor.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.706
Let me try.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:06.425
I had no idea that my business acumen
was giving you such spasms.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:10.763
Hypnotizing fishermen
isn't business acumen, Barnabas.

01:04:11.639 --> 01:04:13.015
Those are my terms.

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:14.725
Here are my terms:

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:17.353
Goest thou to hell, and swiftly, please.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.441
And there may Asmodeus himself
suckle from your diseased teat.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.944
No one talks like you any more,
Barnabas.

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:28.614
Yes, indeed.

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:32.826
I must say this age
does remain a mystery to me.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:36.955
Give me one good reason
why I should not kill you this instant.

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:39.708
Because I'd kill you if you tried.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.294
Impossible.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:44.922
That would require mercy.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.383
Instead, you have made me a monster.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.301
We're both monsters, Barnabas.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:54.848
Just two big fish in an itty-bitty pond.

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:59.395
Now, we can either fight
until one of us is dead...

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:03.857
or we can make...

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:08.445
little fish together.

01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:15.536
I'll be honest. I was really angry at you
for the first century or so.

01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:19.998
Sure, it was fun...

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:24.128
watching your family squirm
and burn away...

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:27.339
like ants under a magnifying glass.

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:32.010
And yes, it was fun being adored
as the Collins name crumbled...

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:35.222
growing wealthy on the backs
of their despair.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:37.391
But lately...

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:41.019
Lately it's just been...

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:43.021
lonely.

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:47.526
We're different from
these people, Barnabas.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.862
We're better than they are.

01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:54.324
That's why I've missed you.

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:58.704
You're the only ant I couldn't...

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.956
burn.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.876
What is it you want, Angelique?

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:05.043
Your love.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.213
You do still love me, don't you?

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:11.383
Somewhere deep down in that cold,
un-beating heart.

01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:17.055
My dear, even Aphrodite herself
could not construct a more odious union.

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:18.390
What if I made you?

01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:20.017
With what, a spell?

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:22.644
A little doll filled with pins?
That is not love.

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:26.315
- With this.
- Oh.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:30.319
The body you once begged me for.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:33.697
I must admit,
they have not aged a day.

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:35.949
I'm willing to start over, Barnabas.

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:40.245
I'm willing to call a truce
if you'll just take me.

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.750
I am not as I once was.

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:46.752
I could change that.

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.004
And if I refuse?

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:51.882
I'll take everything you love...

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:56.094
starting with that little creature
you've been eyeing so fondly.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:59.848
The one who looks like Josette.

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:02.893
Well, then...

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:08.524
I suppose strictly
in the name of her honor...

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:11.735
I must now defile...

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:15.197
your most intimate
and womanly segments.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:18.594
That was a regrettable turn of events.

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:22.096
You didn't seem to regret it.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:23.307
Yes.

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:30.022
Seems that even in death,
I have a weakness for the living flesh.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:32.357
Especially yours.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:37.613
What a cold way
to describe something so hot.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.073
Perhaps.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:47.706
But I cannot succumb to your charms
ever again.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:52.711
Please, forgive me.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.716
If I can't have you, my love...

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:00.761
I'll destroy you.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.236
Five more minutes.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:20.906
This is a very silly play.

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.866
A werewolf.

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:24.493
A werewolf?

01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:27.245
Yeah, well, it's the only station
we get out here.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:29.497
How are we doing?

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:33.960
I do not feel as though
I'm becoming more human as yet.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.218
Give it some time.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:47.099
Time, doctor,
I have an unfortunate excess of.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:55.399
This is my favorite doll, called Lucy.

01:09:55.566 --> 01:10:00.320
And my favorite bit about Lucy
is her crazy, crazy red hair.

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:02.614
I mean, look at her red hair.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:05.701
And my second favorite bit about her...

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:09.454
is her nice, shiny, pink bow and...

01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:11.957
No! Please! Please, no! Please!

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:14.459
Please, I'm begging you! Please, don't!

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:18.338
It's really true! Mommy, Daddy, please!

01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:20.966
Mommy! Daddy!

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:22.300
Mommy!

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:24.720
Please, Daddy! Daddy!

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:30.307
Help me.

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:56.668
Help you what?

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:06.428
A what?

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:07.721
A ball.

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:09.681
And a most splendid one.

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:11.683
A ball for who?

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:13.852
For the entire town, of course.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.271
Don't you know the entire town
kind of hates us?

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:19.191
Balls are demonstrations of power.

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:24.613
Balls are how the ruling class
remain the ruling class.

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:27.699
Exactly what I've been saying.
This family could use some balls.

01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:32.537
Indeed. And the Collins family
have always held the biggest...

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.331
and the most wonderful balls.

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:37.209
Jesus, can somebody shut the drapes?

01:11:37.668 --> 01:11:39.211
You know, Barnabas has a point.

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:42.214
It's about time
we threw a little dough around.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.716
Show the peasants
that we're back in action.

01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:48.637
People don't throw balls any more,
stupid.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.472
Do they not?

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.808
They throw happenings.

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:57.854
And how, pray,
does one throw a happening?

01:11:58.022 --> 01:11:59.231
Well...

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:02.901
first things first,
you'll need a mirror ball.

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:05.195
Whatever that is, we shall have it.

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:07.405
And booze, lots of booze.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:08.615
Carolyn.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:12.577
We shall have spirits enough
to fill a schooner's hull.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.162
And...

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.915
Alice Cooper.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:22.504
I seem to recall an Alice Cooper
from my youth.

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:25.340
Does she reside in Collinsport?

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:26.883
Not exactly.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:30.220
Well, she shall be our guest
nonetheless.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.357
How do you do?

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:44.609
- Thank you for having us.
- Evening.

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:46.528
Good evening. Welcome to Collinwood.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:50.323
I have to hand it to you.
This is a happening.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:53.076
I guess the only thing missing
is Alice Cooper.

01:12:53.244 --> 01:12:57.789
Perhaps you should go and acquaint
yourself with the evening's entertainment.

01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:14.890
I used t be such a sweet, sweet thing
Till they got ahold of me

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:20.103
I opened doors for little old ladies

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:23.064
I helped the blind to see

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:28.153
I got no friends 'cause
they read the papers

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:32.073
They can't be seen with me

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:37.120
And I'm getting real shot down
And I'm feeling mean

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:39.456
Ugliest woman I've ever seen.

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:42.334
No more Mr. Nice Guy

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:46.171
No more Mr. Clean

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.798
No more Mr. Nice Guy

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:54.179
They say he's sick,
He's obscene.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:00.977
I got no friends 'cause
they read the papers

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.687
Master David.

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:05.357
Where is the female coat attendant?

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:07.859
My dad's talking to her inside.

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:12.864
But he told me to keep everybody out.

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:16.034
I'm sure he did, David.
And you've done a marvelous job.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:20.705
But now I would like you to go
and watch Alice Cooper with the others.

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:22.916
But my dad said...

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:27.712
Go and watch the Cooper woman.

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:43.561
You were right about this stuff.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:46.231
Nothing but the best for you, pussycat.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:48.483
Who was the kid?

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:52.237
I have no idea. I never saw him before.

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:55.991
Now...

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:58.410
come here.

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:14.259
Mommy, where's Daddy?

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:17.262
He's been gone for so long.

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:20.056
Is he ever coming home?

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:39.367
I was gone for 14 days

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.997
I could've been gone for more

01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:46.624
Whatever are you doing outside,
my dear?

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.877
You'll catch your death of cold.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.588
I've caught the only thing
that matters, Barnabas.

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:53.965
Your eye.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.220
I have withheld my tender affections...

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.931
fearful that they were unrequited.

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:06.478
I've not spoken of my feelings
to another soul.

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:10.899
Right. You've only spoken
of my birthing hips.

01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:14.277
Yes, well...

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:21.284
I don't know why, but for some reason,
I feel like I can tell you anything.

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:24.913
It's like I've known you forever.

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:27.165
Yes.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:31.419
It's almost hypnotic.

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:33.505
Yes.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:34.756
But, wait, no.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:38.968
I have used no such trickery
to summon your ardor, I assure you.

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:43.515
I don't know what it is. I just know there's
always been something pulling me here.

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:45.850
Pulling me to Collinsport.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:47.852
To you.

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.191
Oh, my dear Victoria.

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:56.861
- Hath my scent offended thee?
- No, no.

01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:58.530
I'm sorry. It's just...

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.993
The people I love
haven't always loved me back.

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:10.625
My own family sent me away.
Swept me under the rug...

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:14.462
because it was easier than having
a daughter who was different.

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:17.549
Who was cursed.

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:21.386
Cursed because I saw things
other little girls didn't.

01:17:23.848 --> 01:17:27.725
They were the loneliest, most painful years
a child could know.

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:31.521
Now, hold still, Maggie.

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:33.731
This will only hurt for a minute.

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:41.990
But as hard as they were,
I never lost my will.

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:45.034
The need to feel the sun
on my face again.

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.752
So I set out in search
of a new home.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.589
A new life, far away from that pain.

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:06.598
But even in my wildest dreams, I never
thought I'd feel as happy as I do now.

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:11.603
To betray one's own kin,
and because she possesses a gift.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:13.104
No, Victoria.

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:14.772
It is unforgivable.

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:21.112
And your parents deserve to boil
in hell's everlasting sulfur.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.284
See my lonely life unfold

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:30.413
Since I've gone away

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:34.709
Hey.

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:36.794
Hey, you're not invited.

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:40.715
Hey.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:42.425
But...

01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:45.470
Sleeping don't come very easy

01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:48.806
In a straight, white vest

01:18:51.143 --> 01:18:56.272
Should like to see that little children

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.608
She's only 4 years old

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.986
For most of my life,
I've wanted a place where I belonged.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:04.239
A place where I could feel at home again.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:06.574
Feel loved again.

01:19:07.326 --> 01:19:10.286
And I've found that place
here at Collinwood.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:14.666
And here.

01:19:37.064 --> 01:19:39.524
We must intensify our efforts.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.943
I have urgent need to be human again.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:43.194
I can explain.

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:45.363
My God.

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:48.116
You're not using your blood
to make me human.

01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:52.203
You're using my blood
to make yourself immortal.

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:56.708
Yes, but, Barnabas, you have a gift.
It isn't fair to keep it all to yourself.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:20:00.086
The Collins family took you in,
bestowed their sacred trust upon you.

01:20:00.254 --> 01:20:01.963
And you brazenly betray that trust.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:03.548
I'm sorry.

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:05.133
I just don't want to grow old.

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:07.552
I want to be beautiful again.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.472
- I want to live forever, like you.
- I'm afraid that is out of the question.

01:20:13.017 --> 01:20:16.561
A stout man contains
some five quarts of blood...

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.855
which, if you will forgive the boast...

01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:22.066
I can consume in a mere
seven and a half seconds.

01:20:22.776 --> 01:20:24.902
But you, my dear little wisp...

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:28.906
I dare say I shall drink you
to a withered husk in less than five.

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:32.076
Please don't kill me. You're a good man.
You're a gentleman.

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:34.412
- Please, forgive me.
- Madam.

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:39.542
I am neither good nor gentle,
and I do not forgive.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:58.728
I should tell you, Willie...

01:20:58.896 --> 01:21:01.314
if you ever speak a word of this
to anyone...

01:21:01.482 --> 01:21:04.984
I shall have to kill you
in a most unpleasant manner.

01:21:05.152 --> 01:21:06.444
Don't worry, Mr. B.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:09.113
I never liked the bitch anyway.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:53.699
Come on. I know you're here.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:57.495
Hey.

01:21:57.663 --> 01:21:59.497
Beautiful workmanship, isn't it?

01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:03.251
I was just looking for the...

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:04.961
This?

01:22:06.713 --> 01:22:09.257
There's nothing worth stealing,
I'm afraid.

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:13.845
Sadly, Elizabeth uses it
for the badminton equipment.

01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:16.931
That's what I was looking for.

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:22.645
What are you?

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.523
I am about to do something so repellent...

01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:29.026
that it sickens me to my very core.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:35.616
I'm going to give you a choice.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:38.369
What choice?

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:41.122
Either you remain at Collinwood...

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:45.376
and devote your every waking moment
to becoming an exemplary father...

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:51.507
the father David so desperately
wants and deserves...

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.217
Or?

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:55.344
Or you leave...

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:56.846
with sufficient money...

01:22:57.014 --> 01:23:01.767
to live your thieving,
selfish life elsewhere.

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:41.516
Where on earth is Dr. Hoffman
when we need her?

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:44.101
Indeed.

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:26.727
Barnabas, you're on fire.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:04.599
I'd like to teach the world to sing

01:25:07.477 --> 01:25:09.937
I demand that you release me
from my curse.

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:12.106
You're late.

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:16.861
What is that?

01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:19.030
The only thing you drink these days.

01:25:23.035 --> 01:25:24.910
From where does it come?

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:26.203
No one you know.

01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:28.372
I promise.

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:36.464
I knew it wouldn't be long
before you barged in...

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:39.383
begging me to make you mortal again.

01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:43.304
Now that Dr. Hoffman isn't around
to give you your little transfusions.

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:45.806
Yes.

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:48.809
Yes, it was a shame...

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:52.647
she was called away
on business so suddenly.

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:57.443
Interesting. I don't know many people
who take business meetings...

01:25:57.611 --> 01:25:59.487
on the bottom of the ocean.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:02.740
She was a liar.

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:05.409
She was stealing my blood.

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:07.703
Aren't we being a smidge hypocritical?

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:11.916
Lying and stealing blood
are things you're rather familiar with.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:16.087
Yes, I killed Dr. Hoffman...

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:20.007
and the workmen and those
very nice, unshaven young people.

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:22.593
But know this:

01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:26.430
With each life I take...

01:26:26.598 --> 01:26:28.891
a piece of my wretched soul dies.

01:26:29.976 --> 01:26:33.729
For I only kill because I'm compelled to.

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:35.606
Compelled by your witchcraft.

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:37.441
By your curse.

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:40.945
Why have you done this to me?

01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:44.448
It's a shame.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:49.745
You know, if you'd just been smart enough
to love me, I would've let her go.

01:26:50.622 --> 01:26:52.581
Speak plainly, snake.

01:26:53.417 --> 01:26:56.377
I sent your little girlfriend
over the cliffs once before.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:59.338
What makes you think
I wouldn't do it again?

01:27:04.511 --> 01:27:07.430
I'm gonna offer you
a business proposal, Barnabas.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.808
My final offer.

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:14.937
Either you agree to rule
this little pond of mine side by side...

01:27:15.105 --> 01:27:17.606
partners and lovers...

01:27:18.316 --> 01:27:22.445
or I put you back in the box.

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:27.116
I have already prepared
my counterproposal.

01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:29.285
It reads thusly:

01:27:29.453 --> 01:27:32.580
You may strategically place
your wonderful lips upon my posterior...

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.290
and kiss it repeatedly!

01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:19.210
Sleeping flame, I summon thee

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:21.629
To your form return

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:24.215
Make the night as bright as day

01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:27.718
And burn, baby, burn

01:28:53.787 --> 01:28:55.162
Wha...?

01:29:29.447 --> 01:29:32.449
I've come to realize shutting you
in that box for all eternity...

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.451
might've been a tad harsh.

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:36.745
So here is the deal:

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:41.500
I'm gonna destroy everything you love...

01:29:42.168 --> 01:29:47.423
and you're gonna take some more time
to think about us.

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.470
See you in a couple centuries, lover boy.

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:11.488
Do not dismay, Barnabas.
We shall yet again escape this nightmare.

01:30:12.616 --> 01:30:16.076
Perhaps only a few brief decades
this time.

01:30:19.497 --> 01:30:21.332
Oh, hello!

01:30:21.499 --> 01:30:23.542
Hello! I hear you!

01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:29.131
Oh, sweet glories be. Whoever you are,
fear not. I will not harm you.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:32.801
What year is it?
How many centuries have I...?

01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:34.720
How long has it been?

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:38.015
It's been 20 minutes.

01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:41.518
Young Master David. How on earth
did you know I was imprisoned?

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:44.188
My mom told me.

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:46.273
You probably think I'm crazy.

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:49.693
Young man, I think nothing of the sort.

01:30:51.029 --> 01:30:52.529
Uncle Barnabas...

01:30:53.907 --> 01:30:56.200
why do you have ladies' underwear
on your face?

01:30:56.534 --> 01:30:59.286
Never mind that. Where is your family?
Where is Victoria?

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:00.663
I haven't seen Vicky...

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:03.749
but everybody else is in the town
watching our cannery burn.

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:05.292
We must save them! Hurry!

01:31:06.544 --> 01:31:08.253
Master David!

01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:12.132
Perhaps you should unchain me first?

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.678
Hank, we need another brigade
out of Portland, quick as you can!

01:31:15.845 --> 01:31:17.554
Get these folks out of here!

01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:22.267
All right, everybody, stand back!
Please, stand back!

01:31:22.435 --> 01:31:25.896
Oh, boy.
Miss Elizabeth's gonna shit a brick.

01:31:26.982 --> 01:31:28.565
Sheriff, we need to talk.

01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:32.319
Christ, Angie, I ain't got time for chitchat.
The damned town's burning!

01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:37.157
You don't have time for proof that
the Collins family is harboring a murderer?

01:31:39.577 --> 01:31:42.663
Yes, I killed Dr. Hoffman...

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:46.500
and the workmen and those
very nice, unshaven young people.

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:50.629
Well, I'll be damned.

01:31:50.797 --> 01:31:53.090
And to think the whole town's
named after them.

01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:56.093
I'd be willing to bet that Barnabas
has already skipped town.

01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:57.970
And I'd be willing to bet...

01:31:58.138 --> 01:32:01.765
that you'll find the corpses of
more of his innocent victims in there!

01:32:01.933 --> 01:32:05.185
The Collins family has rebuilt
their business with murder!

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:09.231
Well, I say, not in my town!

01:32:12.652 --> 01:32:13.944
There's one of them now!

01:32:14.112 --> 01:32:17.614
He's probably the one who started the fire
to cover his boss' tracks.

01:32:18.992 --> 01:32:20.743
- Time to go.
- Where you going?

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:48.062
Willie. What on earth's happened?

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:51.857
Fire. Murder. Angry mob. Run!

01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:54.610
David, go inside.

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:16.131
Liz...

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:19.051
I'm sorry.

01:33:19.219 --> 01:33:21.345
We're gonna have to take you in.

01:33:21.513 --> 01:33:22.763
All of you.

01:33:23.807 --> 01:33:24.848
Bill...

01:33:25.725 --> 01:33:28.477
the Collins family built this town.

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:32.356
We built it with our boats and our nets.

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:35.025
With our sacrifices and our blood.

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:36.985
And this is how you repay us?

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:39.154
You've been harboring a murderer.

01:33:39.989 --> 01:33:41.490
Arrest them.

01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:43.200
I shall go willingly...

01:33:44.786 --> 01:33:47.496
to whatever punishment awaits...

01:33:48.164 --> 01:33:49.206
provided...

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:52.709
no harm befalls my family.

01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:54.461
Hold it right there.

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:03.554
And provided...

01:34:04.389 --> 01:34:06.515
Miss Bouchard goes along with me...

01:34:07.058 --> 01:34:09.143
for she is no less a monster than I.

01:34:14.023 --> 01:34:16.066
Perhaps it is best...

01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:18.235
if we are both destroyed.

01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:25.367
Mr. Collins, back off! I'm warning you!

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:33.417
Go on, slaughter me.

01:34:33.585 --> 01:34:35.502
Show them what you are.

01:34:35.753 --> 01:34:37.087
No.

01:34:37.714 --> 01:34:39.381
I shall show them what we are.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:45.262
Unh!

01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:57.357
What's that man done to Angie?

01:34:58.109 --> 01:35:01.361
It's not him, it's her.

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:03.197
She's a witch.

01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:09.620
Excuse me.

01:35:16.961 --> 01:35:18.712
You gotta get through me first, lady.

01:35:25.637 --> 01:35:28.138
All right, everybody, go on home now.

01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:30.140
- Nothing to see here.
- Let's move.

01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:31.892
You should've loved me, Barnabas.

01:35:32.977 --> 01:35:35.604
None of this would've happened
if you'd just loved me.

01:35:35.772 --> 01:35:39.441
I should have destroyed you.
You've brought me nothing but misery.

01:35:39.817 --> 01:35:41.443
I gave you my heart!

01:35:41.611 --> 01:35:42.819
You have no heart.

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:44.821
You're the curse!

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:47.324
Women are undone by loving you.

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:51.620
Josette, Dr. Hoffman.
And your beloved Vicky.

01:35:52.872 --> 01:35:55.999
I command you to release her
from your curse.

01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:59.711
"Command"? You make me sick.

01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:02.589
Missed me.

01:36:08.179 --> 01:36:11.848
Vulgar, hideous serpent,
I shall deliver you to hell's doorstep.

01:36:25.863 --> 01:36:29.157
Get out of my room!

01:36:54.183 --> 01:36:56.059
Angelique!

01:36:56.227 --> 01:36:58.603
Get out of my house.

01:37:27.508 --> 01:37:29.551
Your house?

01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:02.709
Enough trickery.

01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:06.797
I worshiped you.

01:38:06.964 --> 01:38:08.006
Plagued me.

01:38:09.926 --> 01:38:10.967
Adored you!

01:38:12.053 --> 01:38:14.346
Despised you!

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:20.102
Fine.

01:38:22.355 --> 01:38:25.065
If Collins blood built this house...

01:38:25.983 --> 01:38:28.527
then let us bathe in it.

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:44.060
Leave us alone.

01:39:45.396 --> 01:39:47.063
Carolyn?

01:39:50.401 --> 01:39:52.360
Carolyn, my God.

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:57.324
I'm a werewolf, okay?
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

01:39:59.744 --> 01:40:00.827
Woof.

01:40:32.944 --> 01:40:35.278
What have you done to my daughter?

01:40:36.113 --> 01:40:37.864
Well, Liz...

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:42.035
your perfect Collins pedigree
lacked a bit of substance...

01:40:42.203 --> 01:40:46.289
so I sent the werewolf
who bit Carolyn in her crib.

01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:55.131
Just like I made David
no better than a bastard...

01:40:55.299 --> 01:40:58.802
when I sent his mommy to the ocean floor
to have tea with the tuna.

01:41:01.222 --> 01:41:02.806
And as for you, my love...

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:07.477
I killed your mother and father.

01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:12.857
I cursed your family, my Barnabas.

01:41:13.025 --> 01:41:14.985
They kept us apart.

01:41:15.152 --> 01:41:17.862
They never understood, we're the same.

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:20.156
We're meant to be.

01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:22.325
Leave him alone.

01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:28.498
I think I'll kill you first, orphan.

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:32.836
David, get out!

01:41:33.421 --> 01:41:35.171
Your quarrel is with me.

01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:36.965
My quarrel is with all of you.

01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:38.925
I'm warning you.

01:41:39.343 --> 01:41:40.802
This is your last chance.

01:41:41.345 --> 01:41:42.804
Let us go.

01:41:42.972 --> 01:41:45.515
And what will you do if I don't,
you little bastard?

01:41:46.434 --> 01:41:47.976
Not me.

01:41:48.144 --> 01:41:49.519
My mom.

01:42:23.387 --> 01:42:24.471
Go!

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.862
David, come on.

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:45.200
Willie, come on.

01:43:06.472 --> 01:43:08.765
So this is how it ends.

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.604
So quiet...

01:43:15.231 --> 01:43:17.190
as if you were asleep.

01:43:18.609 --> 01:43:23.071
You know, there was a time
when I might have loved you.

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:26.658
We could have spent eternity together.

01:43:27.451 --> 01:43:29.035
We still...

01:43:29.787 --> 01:43:31.204
can.

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:34.124
You never wanted my love.

01:43:34.792 --> 01:43:37.502
You wanted to possess me.

01:43:37.670 --> 01:43:39.129
No.

01:43:39.797 --> 01:43:42.048
I love you, Barnabas.

01:43:42.967 --> 01:43:45.969
You cannot love, Angelique.

01:43:47.012 --> 01:43:49.389
That is your curse.

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:18.501
Take it.

01:44:45.696 --> 01:44:47.030
Victoria!

01:44:47.198 --> 01:44:48.740
Victoria!

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:03.171
She said Widow's Hill.

01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:20.730
What do we do now?

01:45:21.607 --> 01:45:23.817
What we've always done.

01:45:25.236 --> 01:45:26.820
Endure.

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:03.064
I thought I'd lost you.

01:46:04.525 --> 01:46:05.942
You have lost me.

01:46:07.945 --> 01:46:09.779
I live in the light, Barnabas.

01:46:09.947 --> 01:46:11.781
You live in the shadows.

01:46:11.949 --> 01:46:14.784
I'll grow old and die,
and you'll live forever.

01:46:14.952 --> 01:46:16.953
We will find a way, my love.

01:46:18.664 --> 01:46:20.540
There's only one way.

01:46:20.708 --> 01:46:25.253
No. I will not see you suffer as I do.
Never.

01:46:30.134 --> 01:46:31.301
No!

01:47:03.667 --> 01:47:05.168
Oh, Victoria.

01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:07.712
My sweet Victoria.

01:47:17.765 --> 01:47:19.515
Victoria.

01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:27.857
Josette.

01:47:45.876 --> 01:47:50.296
It is said that blood
is thicker than water.

01:47:50.464 --> 01:47:52.256
It is what defines us.

01:47:52.424 --> 01:47:54.092
Binds us.

01:47:54.259 --> 01:47:56.386
Curses us.

01:47:56.553 --> 01:47:59.555
My name is Barnabas Collins...

01:47:59.723 --> 01:48:03.893
and my curse has finally been broken.
