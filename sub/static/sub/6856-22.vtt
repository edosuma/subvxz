Hostage Crisis

00:06.500 --> 00:10.000
Written by Eoghan Mahony
Supervising Writer: Drew Z. Greenberg
Staff Writer: Brian Larsen
Directed by Giancarlo Volpe

00:10.500 --> 00:14.500
¡¡

00:16.600 --> 00:18.100
Danger looms!

00:18.101 --> 00:20.300
Despite recent victories in the Outer Rim,

00:20.400 --> 00:23.500
criminal minds plot at the
very heart of the Republic!

00:23.600 --> 00:25.700
The bounty hunter Cad Bane

00:25.701 --> 00:28.500
has assembled some of the
deadliest criminals in the galaxy

00:28.501 --> 00:32.400
and plans a daring attack to
seize members of the Senate.

00:32.401 --> 00:35.200
What can be the aim
of this despicable act?

00:36.200 --> 00:37.500
Here we go.

00:39.650 --> 00:41.100
<i>"Attention, attention.</i>

00:41.101 --> 00:42.500
"This is a restricted area.

00:42.501 --> 00:45.100
"No landing is permitted without permission.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.900
"Violators will be prosecuted
to the full extend of the law."

00:51.200 --> 00:52.500
Put up your hands.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.550
I've got business with the Senate.

00:56.551 --> 00:59.050
How about you fall a step aside?

00:59.051 --> 01:02.400
On your knees.
Raise your hands, slowly.

01:03.150 --> 01:07.950
Son, I wouldn't be
so hasty if I were you.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.050
Cuff him.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.000
Where's that coming from?!

01:15.001 --> 01:16.850
I see the shooter up in the tower.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.200
- Over there.
- Aah!

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074

01:38.300 --> 01:41.900
You two, get these uniforms on
and get this platform clear.

01:49.100 --> 01:52.400
<i>"Base to platform,
what was all that? Report."</i>

01:52.700 --> 01:54.400
Protesters against the war,

01:54.401 --> 01:56.100
we've taken care of them.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.400
Finish getting those uniforms on
and clear this platform now.

02:11.450 --> 02:14.800
Everybody else, follow me.

02:22.050 --> 02:25.500
Hey, I'm supposed to be
on a meditative retreat.

02:25.501 --> 02:27.100
We should go away together.

02:27.250 --> 02:30.250
I know a place far from here
where no one would recognise us.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.400
Yeah, it would be like we're
actually husband and wife,

02:33.401 --> 02:36.000
instead of Senator and Jedi.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.200
I... I can't, Annie.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.650
What do you mean you can't?

02:39.651 --> 02:41.500
It's only two weeks,

02:41.501 --> 02:44.000
we'll be back before anyone
even notices we're gone.

02:44.050 --> 02:46.450
I have to bring this bill
before the Senate.

02:46.451 --> 02:47.700
It's important.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
More important than
the way you feel about me?

02:52.300 --> 02:55.700
Not more important,
but important.

02:55.701 --> 02:59.000
The work I do,
the work we both do,

02:59.001 --> 03:00.900
is in service to the Republic.

03:00.901 --> 03:04.200
To protect those who would otherwise
be powerless to protect themselves.

03:04.201 --> 03:06.150
Of course, but those are ideals.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.750
Isn't our love more important to you?

03:08.751 --> 03:10.900
- But I...
- No, no "but".

03:11.400 --> 03:15.500
To me there's nothing more important
than the way I feel about you.

03:15.700 --> 03:16.900
Nothing.

03:16.950 --> 03:18.950
Anakin, don't be so --

03:18.951 --> 03:21.000
- You don't believe me.
- I didn't say --

03:21.001 --> 03:23.300
I'll prove it. Just watch.

03:23.301 --> 03:27.200
When I finished constructing
my lightsaber, Obi-Wan said to me

03:27.201 --> 03:30.700
"Anakin, this weapon is your life."

03:30.800 --> 03:34.000
This weapon is my life.

03:34.001 --> 03:36.200
No, Anakin, I can't.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.350
A Jedi lightsaber is...

03:40.800 --> 03:43.300
Wow, it's heavy than I thought.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.600
It's yours.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.300
Believe me now?

03:48.200 --> 03:50.500
If all you want to do is make fun of me,

03:50.501 --> 03:53.500
- I think you should just go.
- That's not what I want.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.100
Not at all.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Stop!

04:24.100 --> 04:26.100
You know what to do.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.600
I'll figure it out.

04:28.601 --> 04:32.200
You better not fail me, bubble brain.

04:32.201 --> 04:34.000
Don't worry,

04:34.001 --> 04:36.200
I'll have the power out in no time.

04:36.201 --> 04:38.600
The rest of you come with me.

04:42.100 --> 04:46.000
- But Senator Organa, it just wouldn't be...
- Quick, hide!

04:46.001 --> 04:49.100
The situation cannot be delayed.
Now stand aside.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I apologise for my abruptness.

04:52.001 --> 04:54.950
Oh, Senator Organa,
how good to see you.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.200
What is it?

04:56.300 --> 04:58.950
Senator Filo has called
a meeting in the lobby

04:58.951 --> 05:01.400
before we vote on the
Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.700
Right, Privacy Invasion Bill.

05:04.701 --> 05:06.700
We must hurry
if we are to stop the vote.

05:08.550 --> 05:10.300
Coming, Senator Amidala?

05:10.350 --> 05:11.800
Of course.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.200
Quietly...

05:26.600 --> 05:30.400
Guard change happens now.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.200
Here we go.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.100
Now let's go talk to some Senators.

05:56.780 --> 05:58.080
Help me.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.600
No! Aah!

06:02.800 --> 06:07.500
We can not allow the Chancellor to move this
Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill forward.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.400
We are all in agreement then.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.400
Morning, Senators.

06:13.500 --> 06:17.600
You should all consider yourselves
to be in my power.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.500
As long as everybody behaves
this will be quick and painless.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.500
Do nothing and it will al be over soon.

06:26.550 --> 06:29.500
I don't know who you think you are,

06:29.501 --> 06:34.400
but I for one have no intention of
listening to this kind of insolence.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.200
All right then.

06:40.201 --> 06:43.500
If you all gather at the
centre of this lovely atrium

06:43.501 --> 06:48.600
my co-workers and I will relieve you
of any communication devices.

06:48.601 --> 06:50.700
I see five of them here in the room.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.500
- If we --
- What are you going to do?

06:52.501 --> 06:54.100
It's not like we carry weapons.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.300
Chancellor Palpatine.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.800
What is it, Senator Orn Free Taa?

07:03.350 --> 07:05.450
I think you should see this.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.100
Sorry to bother you, Chancellor,

07:08.101 --> 07:11.900
but I've taken control of the
east wing of your Senate building.

07:11.901 --> 07:15.300
The occupants are now my hostages.

07:15.301 --> 07:16.750
If you care about them,

07:16.751 --> 07:21.200
I'd advise you to free Ziro the Hutt
from the detention centre.

07:21.250 --> 07:25.200
You should know that the Republic
does not take kindly to such threats.

07:25.201 --> 07:29.400
If you have attempted such a fool-hardy
action as to kidnap a Senator,

07:29.401 --> 07:33.100
I assure you it will be met
with appropriate force.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.900
This ought to do it.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.200
What's going on?

07:45.300 --> 07:49.100
I'm in control.
I make the rules now.

07:53.550 --> 07:56.100
Orn Free Taa,
help me with this door.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.150
It's no use, sir.

07:58.151 --> 08:01.200
Someone's gotten into
the central control panel.

08:01.201 --> 08:03.600
They've triggered the security system.

08:03.601 --> 08:06.700
The Senate buildings have sealed themselves.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.500
This is Chancellor Palpatine,

08:09.501 --> 08:12.000
there is an emergency
at the Senate Building.

08:12.001 --> 08:14.200
Jedi Council, come in.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.800
Is anyone there?

08:15.801 --> 08:17.600
That's no use either, sir.

08:17.601 --> 08:20.900
They've cut off all communication
with the outside.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.400
Hand over your communication devices please.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.600
I can't let them search me.

08:36.601 --> 08:38.400
What? Why not?

08:38.400 --> 08:41.000
I have something they must not find.

08:41.001 --> 08:42.100
What is it?

08:42.101 --> 08:45.600
Well, hello there little lady.

08:45.601 --> 08:48.100
And who might you be?

08:48.101 --> 08:51.300
I am Padme Amidala.
Senator from Naboo.

08:51.301 --> 08:53.600
And I demand that you
release us immediately.

08:53.601 --> 08:56.250
The Galactic Senate will not
treat with with terrorists.

08:56.300 --> 09:00.300
Ain't you awful young and
pretty to be a senator?

09:07.600 --> 09:10.600
Skywalker?!
After him!

09:16.600 --> 09:19.000
Hello, come in.
Anyone there?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.600
This is General Skywalker,

10:44.601 --> 10:46.400
Chancellor Palpatine,
can you hear me?

10:46.401 --> 10:47.600
My dear boy,

10:47.601 --> 10:50.100
I'm glad to know
you're there and all right.

10:50.101 --> 10:51.300
What is going on down there?

10:51.301 --> 10:54.500
I hear it too.
Coming from up ahead.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.600
<i>"They've sealed the entire building.</i>

10:59.601 --> 11:02.150
<i>"Nobody can get in.
And we can not get out."</i>

11:02.200 --> 11:03.200
It's up to you.

11:03.201 --> 11:06.800
You have to get to the power control room
and turn off the security seal.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.600
You have two more floors to check.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.300
Come on. We've got
two more floors to check.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.800
You take downstairs, I'll go up.

11:47.850 --> 11:49.800
We'll meet on the other side.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
No lightsaber cuts.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.500
Interesting.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.200
What happened?
Where's the droid?

13:05.201 --> 13:06.600
The droid's gone,

13:06.601 --> 13:08.600
but there's good news.

13:08.601 --> 13:11.300
The Jedi's unarmed.

13:11.301 --> 13:12.301
What?

13:12.900 --> 13:16.500
It doesn't look like
he has his lightsaber.

13:16.501 --> 13:19.100
Go, bring him back to me.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Woopsie!

13:30.300 --> 13:32.500
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

13:35.600 --> 13:39.000
- The lightsaber, I've got it.
- What?

13:41.200 --> 13:43.100
Why do you have a Jedi's lightsaber?

13:43.101 --> 13:48.300
The question is whether we should try
and get it back to Ana... the Jedi Knight.

13:48.301 --> 13:49.900
Or use it ourselves.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.700
Everybody quiet.

13:53.701 --> 13:55.500
I've got a call to make.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.400
So here's what you're going to do.

14:00.401 --> 14:03.700
First you're going to make a pardon disc,

14:03.701 --> 14:06.100
you can give it to your friend there.

14:06.201 --> 14:07.550
Hmm, me?

14:07.551 --> 14:11.400
My ship will come and pick him up
and take him to the prison.

14:11.401 --> 14:15.350
Once Ziro has been released
and is handed to me,

14:15.351 --> 14:18.400
then your associates will be released.

14:18.401 --> 14:19.750
Understand?

14:19.751 --> 14:21.200
Oh, I do.

14:21.201 --> 14:26.000
But I feel it is my duty to warn you that
you will end up paying for this outrage.

14:26.001 --> 14:28.100
I can live with that.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.100
Come on, open the door.

14:30.101 --> 14:31.500
I won't hurt you.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.100
Well, well...
What have we here?

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
Blast it!

14:53.800 --> 14:55.450
Tie your little pet up.

14:55.451 --> 14:57.100
We'll bring him to Bane.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.100
Here's the pardon disc.

15:02.700 --> 15:03.800
Let's go.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.800
Why do I have to go to the jail for this?

15:07.801 --> 15:08.900
Move it.

15:08.901 --> 15:10.300
Sorry, Senator.

15:10.700 --> 15:13.300
But everyone has a job to do.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.950
Hurry up.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.300
Young Skywalker.

15:46.100 --> 15:49.750
Not so impressive
without your lightsaber,

15:49.751 --> 15:52.500
are you, Jedi?

15:52.510 --> 15:55.000
Toss him in with the others.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.000
3D, are we on schedule?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.800
Arriving at the prison now.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.700
Unlock the doors.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.200
Oh, it's so bright out here!

16:36.201 --> 16:40.700
Why couldn't they do this
at night when it's cooler?

16:42.250 --> 16:46.400
Go and get the parting gifts.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Oh, look at Senator Orn Free Taa,

17:04.001 --> 17:06.550
he looks so unhappy.

17:10.400 --> 17:16.200
Now get me as far away from
Coruscant as possible, now!

17:17.200 --> 17:19.150
Well, Mr Chancellor,

17:19.151 --> 17:23.599
thanks to your calm leadership,
the crisis has passed.

17:23.601 --> 17:25.250
I got what I want,

17:25.251 --> 17:29.000
so I'll return your Senate
and your Senators.

17:29.001 --> 17:30.500
Enjoy them,

17:30.501 --> 17:34.100
but don't try anything
until the sun has set.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.900
Understand?

17:38.600 --> 17:41.800
We are to rendezvous
back at the Senate building.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.800
What?! No, no, no, no!

17:44.801 --> 17:47.500
The Outer Rim, not the Senate,

17:47.501 --> 17:49.500
you stupid machine!

17:50.100 --> 17:53.200
I don't want to go to the Senate!

17:54.850 --> 17:56.700
We need to get to the landing platform.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.700
- Is everything ready?
- Yep, yep.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.500
Turn on the field.

18:00.501 --> 18:03.950
If you so much as breath
on one of these lasers,

18:03.951 --> 18:06.100
the whole room will blow up.

18:06.101 --> 18:08.100
Senators, Jedi,

18:08.101 --> 18:11.800
I bid you all the most respectful farewell.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.200
Let's go.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.700
All clear!

18:31.600 --> 18:33.100
Sir, are you all right?

18:33.101 --> 18:35.200
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.500
Mission accomplished, sir.

18:36.501 --> 18:37.900
The Chancellor is safe.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.600
Well done, trooper.

18:49.900 --> 18:53.900
You were foolish to think you could
get away with this, bounty hunter?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.900
Now lay down your arms and come quietly.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.100
No, Chancellor.

18:59.101 --> 19:04.800
I am afraid it is you who have been foolish
with your Senators' lives.

19:04.801 --> 19:10.500
One false move and the east wing of
the Senate Building goes up in smoke.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.700
Please, Annie, wake up.

19:14.701 --> 19:17.150
You win, bounty hunter.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.900
Holster!

19:23.000 --> 19:24.200
Stand down.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.500
What are you looking so sad about?

19:39.500 --> 19:42.700
The bounty hunter said
we should just sit here.

19:42.701 --> 19:45.000
I think we should just sit here.

19:45.001 --> 19:47.200
Well, that's not a very good idea.

19:56.350 --> 19:57.350
Come on.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.300
Let's get going.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.400
Too bad I don't have my lightsaber.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.200
You mean this?

20:10.201 --> 20:12.000
I found it where you dropped it.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.300
Now, quickly, we don't have much time.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.600
Well, Hutt,

20:25.800 --> 20:31.400
it doesn't look like prison had
too adverse an effect on you.

20:31.600 --> 20:37.600
Ooh, you can't imagine the
unspeakable things I've suffered!

20:37.650 --> 20:39.900
The horror!

20:39.910 --> 20:43.300
I doubt I'll ever really recover!

20:43.301 --> 20:46.500
How about some dead Senators as pay back?

21:01.300 --> 21:04.900
Another daring rescue, Master Jedi.

21:04.901 --> 21:08.000
I do my best, Senator.

21:09.100 --> 21:15.700
Congratulations on a job well done,
bounty hunter.

21:15.701 --> 21:18.600
Time to pay up, Hutt.

21:18.601 --> 21:21.400
I don't work for free.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.400

21:28.500 --> 21:29.500
Let's get going.

21:29.501 --> 21:32.500
The first season of
"Star Wars: The Clone Wars" is over.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.800
But we've got two words
that will make it all better:

21:36.000 --> 21:38.200
Season Two.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.200
And if you like Bane,

21:40.201 --> 21:41.200
Get ready.

21:41.201 --> 21:43.600
you're gonna be seeing a lot more of him.

21:43.601 --> 21:45.700
Ahsoka, wait!
It's a trap!

21:45.701 --> 21:48.850
Because the bounty huters are here to stay.

21:48.851 --> 21:50.400
You can count on it.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.300

21:52.301 --> 21:55.300
Season Two,
coming this fall.
