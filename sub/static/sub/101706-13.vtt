WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.655
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...Trouble's back in town.

00:03.699 --> 00:06.702
-I'm sorry for all the calls.
-That's what family's for.

00:06.745 --> 00:08.486
<i>Loss is a process.
I'm dealing with it.</i>

00:08.530 --> 00:10.053
<i>One shot at a time?
Bar fights?</i>

00:10.097 --> 00:12.055
I start feeling bad
about a month or so ago.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.100
-What'd the doctor say?
-She said

00:13.143 --> 00:14.884
we need to run some tests.

00:14.927 --> 00:17.104
What about those test results?

00:17.147 --> 00:18.670
Maybe it's good news.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.324
And if it isn't?

00:20.368 --> 00:22.979
Then we will know
what we're facing together.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.939
Darryl and me,
we starting a business together.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.767
Little father
and son thing.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.117
You giving us a loan?

00:30.160 --> 00:31.509
I was thinking
I'd be more of a partner

00:31.553 --> 00:33.337
-in the business.
-Our customers

00:33.381 --> 00:35.687
ain't necessarily too fond
of the boys in blue.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.559
-You want the money or not?
-Yes, we want the money.

00:37.602 --> 00:38.951
Right, Dad?

00:40.170 --> 00:42.520
Yeah. Yeah, son.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.654
Meet John Afton.
Why?

00:45.697 --> 00:48.309
Ten years ago,
he founded a hedge fund,

00:48.352 --> 00:49.919
Afton Assets, LLC.

00:49.962 --> 00:52.095
Manages $50 billion in assets.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.358
Billion? With a B?

00:54.402 --> 00:55.838
People will sign over
their entire life savings

00:55.881 --> 00:58.754
if you guarantee them
a 15% annual return.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.234
15% sounds way
too good to be true.

01:00.277 --> 01:01.713
Proving you're not
his kind of sucker.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.715
Couple years back,
Agent Valdez

01:03.759 --> 01:05.369
and her team at
the FBI got a tip

01:05.413 --> 01:06.892
that Afton was running a grift.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.285
Two days ago, we finally flipped

01:08.329 --> 01:10.113
a source in Afton's back office.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.942
Passed us documents showing
Afton Assets is a Ponzi scheme

01:12.985 --> 01:14.726
about to hit the end
-of the track.
-Which means

01:14.770 --> 01:17.164
his clients are gonna lose
their entire investment.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.382
The warrant's coming down
tomorrow morning,

01:18.426 --> 01:19.514
and we'd like SWAT
to handle the arrest.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.645
Seems like a lot of firepower

01:20.689 --> 01:22.473
for a paper tiger.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.562
Afton owns a mansion in
the Los Feliz Hills.

01:24.606 --> 01:26.129
He's got a couple
of armed guards

01:26.173 --> 01:28.000
that work
security for him.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.132
Maybe he surrenders
when he sees the LAPD

01:29.176 --> 01:30.960
and the FBI on his doorstep.

01:31.003 --> 01:32.440
But we're there in case his
muscle gets a little zealous.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.485
Exactly.

01:34.529 --> 01:35.878
My team will set up surveillance
overnight and we'll have eyes

01:35.921 --> 01:37.923
360 on his property before dawn.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.795
All right, I'll pull
the blueprints for the
house and brief my team.

02:01.817 --> 02:04.994
Hello? Anybody here?

02:33.414 --> 02:36.025
Street? Hey.

02:36.068 --> 02:37.548
Okay, um,

02:37.592 --> 02:38.593
this is a little embarrassing.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.160
What happened?

02:40.203 --> 02:41.639
Just don't judge me.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.207
I may mock, but I never judge.
Promise.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.992
I'm at a motel
in Hollywood and, um,

02:47.036 --> 02:51.214
I don't remember how I got here
or, um, where my car is.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.000
-You there?
-I'm on my way.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.393
Hey!

02:56.437 --> 02:57.438
Where you headed?

02:57.481 --> 02:59.091
Oh, I'll see you at HQ, man.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.926
Damn. Good morning, kid.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.754
Hey. Didn't hear you
coming in last night.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.147
-You was working late?
-Yeah.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.714
Planning to serve
a big warrant today.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.281
Then I had to check in
with Pops.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.673
Yeah, old man
still can't believe

03:15.717 --> 03:16.979
he's officially cancer-free.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.763
Me, neither.

03:18.807 --> 03:21.157
Nobody gets ready
for good news.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.376
You know what I'm saying?

03:22.419 --> 03:23.812
What you doing up so early?

03:23.855 --> 03:26.031
My dad, he has a lead
on a garage for the auto shop.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.555
The landlord
already has an offer,

03:27.598 --> 03:29.557
but if we give him a little
extra, he says it's ours.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.080
So we're gonna
go check it out real quick.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.734
So you're gonna spend
the morning with Leroy?

03:32.777 --> 03:34.388
You gonna make it
to school on time?

03:34.431 --> 03:36.259
Yeah, might be
a little late to first period,

03:36.303 --> 03:37.217
but when was
the last time a mechanic

03:37.260 --> 03:38.827
really needed chemistry, right?

03:38.870 --> 03:40.785
I don't know,
I kind of liked chem.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.700
Yeah, that's 'cause
-you like to cook.
-Yes, I do.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.224
You know, speaking of that,

03:44.267 --> 03:46.182
how about some dinner
at home tonight?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.966
It's been a minute since
the two of us just kicked it.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.316
I'll grill up
some quality burgers.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.752
There got to be fries
on the plate, then.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.493
Done deal.
All right.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.505
You look terrible.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.463
-Mm.
-Not that I'm judging.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.204
I wouldn't have bothered you
if I had a better choice.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.814
So what's the plan?

04:09.858 --> 04:11.294
Uh, we're gonna drive
around the nearest bars,

04:11.338 --> 04:13.818
widen the perimeter
until we find my car

04:13.862 --> 04:15.298
and then we just
show up to work.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.300
You're not
coming in today, Chris.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.388
You're not a hundred percent.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.085
Until I finish this cup.

04:20.129 --> 04:22.697
-Thank you.
-You call in sick,

04:22.740 --> 04:24.612
it's not even a lie,
I'll back you up with Hondo.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.178
Okay?

04:27.397 --> 04:29.094
What happened to you, anyway?

04:29.138 --> 04:30.313
I don't know.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.011
What's the last thing
you remember?

04:35.013 --> 04:36.754
Putting on my party shoes
at home.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.104
So y-you don't know
who was with you?

04:39.148 --> 04:40.932
I know it was
a guy, I know

04:40.976 --> 04:43.108
we had sex, I know

04:43.152 --> 04:44.675
I used a credit
card for the room,

04:44.719 --> 04:46.547
I know he left.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.551
There's nothing else
I need to know,

04:50.594 --> 04:53.162
except where the hell
did I park my car?

04:55.120 --> 04:57.079
-I hate this.
-Hey, hey.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.994
We're gonna find
your ride. Okay?

05:00.038 --> 05:02.084
Bars near me.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.610
Figuring he didn't
drive that far.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.308
I mean, look at this place.
It's not exactly a...

05:08.351 --> 05:09.874
a resort destination.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.528
I've been in worse.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.182
Ready?

05:15.010 --> 05:16.577
Thanks for coming to the rescue.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.504
Commander.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.288
Just a reminder,
I'm out tomorrow morning.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.463
The class show-and-tell
for Matthew, right?

05:33.507 --> 05:34.682
Actually, it's, uh,
Career Day now.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.379
Oh, that's right.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.728
What are you showing off
this year?

05:37.772 --> 05:39.817
bomb disposal robot.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.124
Pulling out all the stops.
I thought it was just Lila's

05:42.167 --> 05:44.344
private school that brought
out your competitive side.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.389
Except now I'm trying to impress
the kids, not the grown-ups.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.391
Same show,
different audience.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.393
Go ahead and get
your team suited up.

05:50.437 --> 05:51.699
Hondo's on standby
for the warrant.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.396
You know, you're
down one today.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.312
-Who?
-Alonso. She called in sick.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.580
Warrant just came through,
Commander.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.148
Earlier than expected.
Any visual of Afton yet?

06:06.191 --> 06:07.932
My spotter just saw him
through one of the windows

06:07.976 --> 06:09.369
in the camera feed
having breakfast.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.022
Run the plan one
last time, Sergeant.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.763
All right, we got two entrances.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.591
20-David will approach
on the main drive

06:14.635 --> 06:16.419
on the one-side
with the SWAT A.V.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.595
Tell Afton's security
to open the gate

06:18.639 --> 06:19.683
and surrender their weapons.

06:19.727 --> 06:20.945
On the off chance
that they don't,

06:20.989 --> 06:22.643
that's why we got Black Betty.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.949
<i>Valdez,
check the front gate feed.</i>

06:24.993 --> 06:26.211
Looks like Afton has a visitor.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.561
Copy that, Grayson.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.040
Any idea who it is?

06:29.084 --> 06:30.694
Negative. Working on it.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.088
Here to deliver your speakers.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.486
Delivery guys.

06:39.529 --> 06:42.227
Sounds like Afton ordered
a new speaker system.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.707
Too bad he won't get
to enjoy it.

06:43.751 --> 06:44.708
7:30 a.m.?

06:44.752 --> 06:46.014
That's early
for a delivery.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.538
Have Agent Grayson radio
as soon as they're gone.

06:48.582 --> 06:51.411
Last thing we need is civilians
on-site as potential hostages.

07:09.864 --> 07:10.952
Come on in.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.000
Patrol will lock off all traffic
on the streets around

07:16.044 --> 07:17.741
Afton's mansion. Now, once
we've cleared the property,

07:17.785 --> 07:18.655
FBI has the scene.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.053
Wait, hold up.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.663
It takes one guy

07:26.707 --> 07:28.404
to lift a box of speakers
out of the truck

07:28.448 --> 07:30.928
but two guys to put an
empty box back inside.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.452
That's because
it ain't empty.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.366
-Like they're moving evidence.
-Like they're moving him.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.803
What if Afton
got tipped off?

07:35.846 --> 07:37.631
No way.
Afton's a high-priority target.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.284
-We did not have a leak.
-Understood,

07:39.328 --> 07:41.243
but something in that box
might be useful to your case.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.725
Grayson, do not lose sight
of that truck.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.727
You and Deacon catch up
with Grayson. I'll have the team

07:46.770 --> 07:48.511
follow in Black Betty.
If the truck's clear,

07:48.555 --> 07:49.686
reroute to the mansion

07:49.730 --> 07:51.035
and proceed with the arrest
as planned.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.341
Roger.

08:13.754 --> 08:14.755
Vehicle just stopped
at an underpass,

08:14.798 --> 08:16.539
headed south on Holly.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.116
<i>Afton's in the back of the truck with two suspects.</i>

08:28.159 --> 08:29.552
Gonna get a better look.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.336
Grayson, hang back.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.555
I'm being careful.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.430
Fellas, we got us a tail.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.258
My three o'clock.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.522
I spotted that van earlier.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.439
Command to 20-David, sending
unis to Grayson's location.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.485
Roger that, Commander.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.836
Grayson, do not engage until
backup has arrived on scene.

08:52.880 --> 08:53.968
There's a second vehicle.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.752
Can't make out the plates
from here.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.798
Grayson, keep your distance!

09:04.892 --> 09:08.939
Grayson!

09:13.291 --> 09:14.249
Grayson, you there?

09:14.292 --> 09:15.380
Respond!

09:16.381 --> 09:17.861
Respond!

09:53.854 --> 09:56.247
All right. Copy that, Deacon.
I'll let him know.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.335
40-David Squad
raided the mansion.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.642
Confirmed Afton's in the wind.

09:59.686 --> 10:00.991
Any news
about Grayson?

10:01.035 --> 10:03.080
Deacon says it's touch and go.

10:03.124 --> 10:06.214
I mean, Hondo gave him first aid
until the EMTs arrived but...

10:06.257 --> 10:08.825
the guy already lost a lot of
blood. Deac's on his way back.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.175
Hondo's gonna stay at the
hospital to wait for Valdez.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.264
It's never easy when one
of your own gets injured.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.484
No, man, the whole
-team takes a blow.
-Yeah.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.225
Any clue how Afton knew
about the warrant?

10:17.268 --> 10:18.356
FBI's investigating
internally.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.707
We're taking over
Afton's arrest.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.231
Metro's surveilling
his personal jet at Burbank.

10:23.274 --> 10:24.536
Okay, what about family?

10:24.580 --> 10:25.625
Any family
he might ask for help?

10:25.668 --> 10:27.235
Patrol's tracking them down.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.976
We got BOLOs for Afton

10:29.019 --> 10:30.630
at every major airport
and marinas,

10:30.673 --> 10:32.806
but leaves a lot
of public airstrips and docks

10:32.849 --> 10:34.155
he could use
to slip our grip.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.460
Yeah,
with his fat bank accounts,

10:35.504 --> 10:36.810
man, he'll find a way.

10:36.853 --> 10:39.464
Okay, what about
the extraction team he hired?

10:39.508 --> 10:42.032
Forensics pulled a clean print
from the gate intercom.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.078
RHD's running it now.

10:44.121 --> 10:46.297
Maybe it gives us
the bastards.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.082
Yeah, wasn't an amateur crew.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.650
-These guys are pros.
-Well, bad luck for them.

10:50.693 --> 10:51.694
So are we.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.874
WOMAN

10:57.918 --> 11:00.485
X-ray tech to room 208.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.578
Ms. Grayson. I'm
Sergeant Harrelson.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.450
I'm the officer
who found your son.

11:09.973 --> 11:13.150
The doctor said that Bobby
would've bled to death

11:13.194 --> 11:15.370
before the EMTs
ever even reached him

11:15.413 --> 11:17.241
if it weren't for you.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.592
You gave him a chance.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.507
Thank you.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.251
I'm really sorry that you
have to go through this.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.952
Do you have kids,
Sergeant?

11:31.995 --> 11:35.346
I'm raising a teenage boy.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.783
So you know.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.350
You can't protect your kids
once they're grown.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.396
They don't hear you anymore.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.485
Mind of their own.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.925
You got to let them make
their own choices at some point.

11:48.969 --> 11:52.668
We just hope that
they choose right.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.150
I never wanted Bobby
to join the Bureau,

11:56.193 --> 11:59.022
but I couldn't
tell him that.

11:59.066 --> 12:03.287
Every time I saw a call
from an unknown number,

12:03.331 --> 12:06.508
I-I stop breathing.

12:08.205 --> 12:10.773
"Is this the call?"

12:10.817 --> 12:13.123
Today was the call.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.431
If you need anything from me

12:16.474 --> 12:18.128
or the LAPD,
will you let me know?

12:18.172 --> 12:21.958
Nothing more to do now
except wait.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.407
Durham.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.235
First day tomorrow, huh?

12:38.279 --> 12:39.933
Joining 60-Squad.
Becker's team.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.370
-Yes, sir.
-Well, they'll
make you feel welcome.

12:42.413 --> 12:43.893
We all remember
our first day,

12:43.937 --> 12:46.200
and, uh, well,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.506
-It's always terrible.
-Still can't believe
I'm on SWAT.

12:48.550 --> 12:51.335
Best of the best. I mean,
-my wife is crazy proud.
-Let me guess.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.815
Feels a little fake, huh?

12:52.859 --> 12:55.383
-Yeah, something like that.
-My first day,

12:55.426 --> 12:58.081
I was so nervous, I backed
Black Betty into a utility pole.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.561
At speed.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.345
Knocked power
out of 1,500 homes.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.564
That a true story?

13:02.607 --> 13:04.609
Wish it weren't.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.307
So, how long you
been married?

13:06.350 --> 13:08.918
A while now. After high school,
we started dating,

13:08.962 --> 13:10.485
and when it's right,
it's right, you know?

13:10.528 --> 13:12.052
You've got a little boy,
if I remember.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.705
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.969
He's, uh, two,
-going on two and a half.
-Oh.

13:16.012 --> 13:18.841
So ...u're almost through
the worst of it.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.148
Got four kids,
including a toddler.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.280
The first of anything's
always the hardest.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.717
But then you're a vet.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.067
You already know
how to do the job.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.634
Tomorrow, just do the job.

13:29.678 --> 13:30.810
Thank you, Sergeant.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.376
Hey, I'm giving
a demonstration

13:32.420 --> 13:33.638
at my son's school tomorrow,
so I won't be here

13:33.682 --> 13:34.857
-to watch you roll out.
-Oh.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.642
Let me be the first to
say welcome to SWAT.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.039
Patrol send an update?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.780
Yep. They got officers

13:44.824 --> 13:47.000
staking out Afton's friends,
his three ex-wives.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.132
Three? Not a
Catholic, I take it.

13:49.176 --> 13:52.701
He had enough kids
to qualify. No offense.

13:52.744 --> 13:53.702
Look, there's only one
that they haven't found.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.660
It's his oldest, Jonah.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.271
He's a USC undergrad,
19 years old.

13:57.314 --> 14:00.056
Not at his apartment.
His phone goes to voice mail.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.666
You think he's
-with his father?
-I doubt it.

14:01.710 --> 14:02.929
His mom,
ex-wife number one,

14:02.972 --> 14:05.583
told Street that Afton
hardly ever sees the kid.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.585
Well, this guy's an
all-around prince.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.152
More I hear about him,
the worse he sounds.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.459
Well, Street put out a BOLO
for Jonah just in case.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.721
RHD got a hit on the print

14:12.764 --> 14:14.375
from the gate intercom.

14:14.418 --> 14:17.117
Otto Brady. Former Navy SEAL.
Owns and operates

14:17.160 --> 14:18.901
a private security company
called Capstone.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.599
-Capstone?
-Yeah, you heard of them?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.298
These guys
work internationally.

14:24.341 --> 14:25.386
Everything from running security

14:25.429 --> 14:27.127
for high-profile assets

14:27.170 --> 14:28.824
to protecting merchant vessels
from pirates.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.217
A few of them even got caught
delivering guns

14:30.260 --> 14:31.871
to Houthi rebels in Yemen.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.830
So mercenaries. I wonder how big
of a payday Afton's promised

14:34.874 --> 14:36.919
for them to be willing
to shoot an FBI agent.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.139
Enough to retire in luxury
someplace without extradition.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.705
So, I got something.

14:40.749 --> 14:43.056
Last year, Owen hired
one of his Army Ranger buddies

14:43.099 --> 14:45.232
to do security with us,
guy named Don Harrow.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.755
He had just quit
working for Capstone.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.017
Said it was a bad experience.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.977
-He say why?
-Not at the time, but, uh,

14:51.020 --> 14:53.109
he's on his way in.
Let's ask him.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.676
I met Brady
just after he started Capstone.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.243
Dude was a straight arrow.

14:56.286 --> 14:57.940
Smart, focused.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.942
I left the Rangers
six months prior.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.726
Felt a little lost.
Figured why the hell not?

15:01.770 --> 15:03.772
What kind of jobs
-did you do?
-In the beginning?

15:03.815 --> 15:05.165
Celebrities heading to Darfur

15:05.208 --> 15:06.775
for a humanitarian mission,
we'd protect them.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.082
Oil companies negotiating
a deal in Libya,

15:09.125 --> 15:10.692
we'd coordinate transport
on the ground.

15:10.735 --> 15:13.129
Got involved in international
kidnappings a few times.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.479
Rescued some kids.
Those were fun.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.307
So, why'd you quit?

15:17.351 --> 15:18.961
Brady started chasing the money.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.355
Didn't matter who
or where it came from.

15:21.398 --> 15:22.834
My last assignment,
we got hired

15:22.878 --> 15:24.749
to fly some French
politician's squeeze

15:24.793 --> 15:26.664
to Majorca for the weekend.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.929
Easy paycheck
till I saw the girl.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.321
She couldn't have been
more than 13.

15:31.365 --> 15:34.150
So, I told Brady we need
to report the slimeball.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.978
Brady gave me 20 seconds
to get off the plane,

15:36.022 --> 15:37.980
or he was gonna put a bullet
in my skull.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.678
I got off the plane,
never saw him again.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.158
You know anyone
still working for him?

15:42.202 --> 15:44.508
Guys would always
rotate in and out,

15:44.552 --> 15:46.597
few ever staying longer
than six months.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.599
No idea
who Brady's working with now.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.601
What about any old
contacts he might lean on

15:50.645 --> 15:52.386
-to get out of the country?
-Plenty of those.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.083
I can think of a dozen
just in California.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.780
Let's start there.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.434
Hey. Deac said
you could use some help

15:57.478 --> 15:59.393
with Harrow's list
of Capstone contacts?

15:59.436 --> 16:02.657
Yeah. Here you go.
Start with the Js.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.703
Hey, you rolled out early
this morning. Everything okay?

16:05.747 --> 16:07.879
Yeah, good enough.
I made it to work on time.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.317
Look, I'm not trying
to get all up in your business,

16:10.360 --> 16:12.319
but was that Chris
-who called this morning?
-Yeah.

16:12.362 --> 16:13.668
She wasn't feeling great.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.061
-And needed you in person?
-Come on.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.236
Save your
interrogation techniques

16:16.279 --> 16:17.759
for the suspects, okay?

16:17.802 --> 16:20.196
Only because I took
a couple calls from her myself

16:20.240 --> 16:22.155
in Berlin after Erika died.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.678
Look,

16:23.721 --> 16:25.854
grief makes for bad decisions,
you know?

16:25.897 --> 16:27.203
I'll stop by her place later.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.251
Oh, we just got a hit

16:31.294 --> 16:33.427
-off the list. Omar Khaled.
-What?

16:33.470 --> 16:35.646
Charter pilot
out of San Francisco.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.735
ATC log at Van Nuys Airport

16:37.779 --> 16:39.302
shows his Cessna landed
there a half hour ago.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.912
Do you believe
-in coincidences?
-Almost never.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.045
Has to be Brady's exit plan
with Afton. Go.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.056
LAPD. Show me your hands.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.971
-Hands!
-Whoa, whoa, I'm unarmed!
I'm just a pilot.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.190
On your feet. Slowly.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.279
26-David. Plane's empty.

16:59.322 --> 17:00.541
No sign of them
around the hangar.

17:00.584 --> 17:02.978
-Where's Brady?
-I don't know.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.632
He called me this morning,
asked if I could

17:04.675 --> 17:06.547
fly a client to Beijing ASAP.

17:06.590 --> 17:07.678
He was supposed
to meet me here

17:07.722 --> 17:09.854
-for takeoff an hour ago.
-Call him.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.074
-Get his ETA.
-No, man. I can't do that.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.076
Word gets out I helped
the cops bust a client,

17:14.120 --> 17:15.817
-my business goes under.
Your client

17:15.860 --> 17:17.079
Brady shot an FBI agent
this morning.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.211
You don't start talking,

17:18.254 --> 17:19.647
that's aiding
and abetting a fugitive.

17:19.690 --> 17:20.822
You want anything else from me,

17:20.865 --> 17:22.084
you need to talk
to my lawyer, sir.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.129
Tan, flex him.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.260
Turn around.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.263
20-David. We got
the pilot in custody,

17:27.307 --> 17:28.438
but no Brady, no Afton.

17:28.482 --> 17:29.570
We'll stay put, be ready

17:29.613 --> 17:31.224
to take them down
when they show up.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.621
What's wrong?

17:37.665 --> 17:39.841
Khaled should've called in
ten minutes ago

17:39.884 --> 17:41.277
for his check-in.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.104
Maybe he lost track of time.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.411
There he is.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.631
That's my son.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.116
Jonah.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.248
I've been calling you for hours.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.249
My phone died.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.250
I spent the night at Mary's.

17:57.293 --> 17:58.425
What are you doing here?

17:58.468 --> 17:59.904
You need to come with me.
You're not safe.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.255
Okay? Let's go. I'll explain
on the way. Come on.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.170
Give him a second.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.345
He'll come.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.129
Hey, we got Afton's kid.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.522
Round up Dante
and get over here.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.132
Khaled hasn't checked in yet,

18:10.176 --> 18:11.481
so we're going
to the safe house.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.661
Uh, correction. Stay put.
We'll come and get you.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.968
-A cop just showed.
I have visual

18:20.011 --> 18:22.144
on Jonah Afton with
suspect John Afton from BOLOs.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.107
Shots fired! Shots fired!

18:28.150 --> 18:29.499
-We got to go!
-Move, kid.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.197
Mary!

18:31.240 --> 18:34.287
-Dad! What the hell?
-Next shot's the messy one.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.940
What is wrong with you?!

18:35.984 --> 18:37.725
Move. Go, go. Move, move, move.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.379
-I'm going. I'm going. I'm going.
-Move.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.137
Help's on the way, ma'am.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.226
Suspects are in a black SUV
heading southbound on Willow.

19:06.101 --> 19:08.190
Any update
-from Becker's squad?
-Still no sign

19:08.234 --> 19:09.452
of Brady or Afton
at the airport.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.627
Their plan must've changed.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.063
What about RHD?

19:12.107 --> 19:13.326
Any leads on Jonah's
whereabouts?

19:13.369 --> 19:14.979
Well, so far,
only the description

19:15.023 --> 19:16.285
the girlfriend gave
of the getaway car.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.722
We put out a BOLO, but nada.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.942
They also found
Jonah's phone on a sidewalk

19:20.985 --> 19:22.073
a few blocks
from the scene.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.901
Brady must've figured
we'd track it.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.729
So, a whole lot
-of dead ends.
-Well, at least we blocked

19:25.773 --> 19:27.731
their plan A
when we grabbed the pilot.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.516
They got to be scrambling
for another way out.

19:29.559 --> 19:31.126
Afton could've been
en route to Beijing

19:31.170 --> 19:32.301
with a glass of good champagne

19:32.345 --> 19:34.260
before we even knew
his pilot's name.

19:34.303 --> 19:37.176
Now, why would he slow down to
snatch a son he hardly sees?

19:37.219 --> 19:38.612
You don't think
it was fatherly love?

19:38.655 --> 19:40.091
Excuse me, Commander?

19:40.135 --> 19:42.050
Just got body cam footage
from the officer

19:42.093 --> 19:43.617
that spotted
Afton and Jonah.

19:43.660 --> 19:44.879
You see right there?

19:44.922 --> 19:47.708
That's a Finder tag.
It's a GPS tracker

19:47.751 --> 19:49.057
you can locate
with an app on your phone.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.190
Street gave me one
after we spent two hours

19:51.233 --> 19:52.582
looking for the keys
to my truck.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.715
If we can access
Jonah's phone,

19:54.758 --> 19:56.456
we can use the app
to figure out where he is.

19:56.499 --> 19:57.848
Or at least
where his backpack is.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.023
We'd need his password.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.242
You think his girlfriend
might know it?

20:00.286 --> 20:01.417
Well, she's still in surgery.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.289
Gunfire ruptured her eardrum.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.247
Why don't you two
head over there and talk to her

20:05.291 --> 20:06.901
as soon as they let you.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.342
Mystery solved.

20:13.386 --> 20:15.997
Oh. Not
sure I want to know.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.391
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.

20:18.434 --> 20:21.307
Remember the bar
where we found my car?

20:21.350 --> 20:23.047
It was the bartender.

20:23.091 --> 20:25.920
So I made a good, safe choice.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.748
-No worries.
-Nothing's a choice

20:27.791 --> 20:29.402
if you can't remember it.

20:29.445 --> 20:30.794
Me and him, we're friends.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.970
Okay. When the bartender's

20:33.014 --> 20:34.233
your buddy,
maybe you're spending

20:34.276 --> 20:35.799
a little too much time
at the bar?

20:35.843 --> 20:37.497
You know what,
I-I liked you better

20:37.540 --> 20:38.498
before you turned into
such a prude.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.021
Why are you even here?

20:40.064 --> 20:41.979
Go save the rest
of the world.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.417
-I'm fine.
-You're not fine.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.333
You're torn up about Erika,
just like the rest of us.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.335
But getting all
self-destructive

20:49.378 --> 20:51.989
is a terrible way
to handle grief.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.556
Thanks for
your personal insight.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.384
You and me,

20:55.428 --> 20:56.690
we're the children
of drunks.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.822
We know what it looks like.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.563
You've been drinking
right now, haven't you?

21:00.607 --> 21:02.043
Little hair of
the dog, yeah?

21:02.086 --> 21:03.479
For the hangover?

21:03.523 --> 21:05.307
It helps.

21:05.351 --> 21:06.917
You didn't plan
on drinking

21:06.961 --> 21:08.702
until you blacked
out last night.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.094
But you did.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.879
You didn't plan on...

21:11.922 --> 21:14.751
ending up in some fleabag motel,
but you did.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.318
I should've
never called you.

21:16.362 --> 21:19.756
Except Tan
already helped me out once.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.063
I've leaned on Luca before.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.760
Deacon can't keep
a secret from Hondo,

21:23.804 --> 21:25.980
and Hondo would have
to tell Hicks.

21:26.023 --> 21:27.286
You were the only one
left standing.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.331
So don't pat yourself
on the back too hard.

21:30.637 --> 21:33.640
-I'll check in with you later.
-Don't bother.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.772
You already made
your point. I get it.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.907
It's no bother at all.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.565
Wait, hold-hold on, hold on.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.218
What does that even mean?

21:47.262 --> 21:49.177
I thought the teacher was
in charge of the class,

21:49.220 --> 21:52.311
not some parent posse.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.487
I am proud of my badge.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.489
Let me ask you something--
does that make me too toxic

21:56.532 --> 21:58.491
to attend the science fair
next month?

21:58.534 --> 22:00.144
Okay. Well, good.
I'll see you then.

22:02.973 --> 22:04.540
Hey.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.063
Something happen?

22:06.107 --> 22:08.588
Yeah. That was, uh, that
was Matthew's teacher.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.633
I just got fired from
his career day tomorrow.

22:10.677 --> 22:13.419
-Come on, now. What?
-Yeah.

22:13.462 --> 22:15.203
Apparently,

22:15.246 --> 22:17.771
some of the parents think that
a cop is the wrong kind of guest

22:17.814 --> 22:19.250
to have in a class these days.

22:19.294 --> 22:20.817
Wow.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.384
Sorry, man.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.168
What am I supposed
to tell Matthew?

22:24.212 --> 22:25.387
He's got no context.

22:25.431 --> 22:26.867
We don't let our kids
watch the news.

22:28.869 --> 22:31.741
Some cops just don't look
like heroes on cell phones.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.744
So now I'm some
urban war criminal...

22:34.788 --> 22:36.529
to this smug young teacher

22:36.572 --> 22:38.835
who's-who's hiding
behind these parents.

22:38.879 --> 22:41.011
They don't know
-you, Deacon.
-That's the thing. They do.

22:41.055 --> 22:44.188
I've known most of them since
Matthew was in kindergarten.

22:45.842 --> 22:48.584
I can't believe
it has gotten this bad.

22:48.628 --> 22:49.933
Deac, this ain't
nothing new.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.195
It's just loud now.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.806
And public.

22:52.849 --> 22:55.330
You know, I think about

22:55.374 --> 22:57.767
officers like
Grayson, Erika,

22:57.811 --> 23:00.988
-shot in the line of duty.
-And you don't like

23:01.031 --> 23:02.990
being stereotyped as a thug.

23:03.033 --> 23:05.906
Well, you know what?
Nobody does.

23:05.949 --> 23:09.257
You became a police officer

23:09.300 --> 23:10.911
-to protect and to serve.
-Mm-hmm.

23:10.954 --> 23:13.696
We protect the city.
We are not the problem.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.483
So who is the problem?

23:18.484 --> 23:20.921
People who break the law.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.575
And what about when
cops break the law?

23:22.618 --> 23:24.794
Then they
should be prosecuted.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.537
It doesn't make
the rest of us criminals.

23:32.149 --> 23:34.717
Same's true on both
sides of the line.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.336
Not so much

23:45.380 --> 23:46.512
as a dead squirrel inside.

23:46.555 --> 23:47.774
We're good.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.734
Put my son in a safe place.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.867
Make sure he can't run off.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.410
Don't worry, Mr. Afton.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.933
We're off the grid.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.282
No neighbors.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.588
Perfect safe house.

24:19.632 --> 24:21.808
Yeah, well,
we shouldn't need a safe house.

24:21.851 --> 24:24.288
Whole thing's been a disaster
from start to finish.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.247
And that FBI agent
this morning,

24:26.290 --> 24:29.903
-you didn't have to shoot him.
-Well, he was
radioing for backup.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.861
He was a threat
to both of us.

24:31.905 --> 24:33.907
And my son's girlfriend?

24:33.950 --> 24:35.561
She wasn't a threat.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.085
You made her a victim
and a witness.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.130
Due respect,

24:40.174 --> 24:41.871
we'd have made international
airspace two hours ago

24:41.915 --> 24:44.221
if you hadn't
slowed us down

24:44.265 --> 24:45.484
with this side trip
to grab your boy--

24:45.527 --> 24:48.138
which wasn't
on the agenda.

24:48.182 --> 24:49.923
As if I'd take two
for the price of one?

24:49.966 --> 24:52.316
You want the rest
of your payment?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.971
Take care of business
and get us out of here,

24:55.015 --> 24:57.887
without adding
to the body count.

24:57.931 --> 25:00.020
I'll add a bonus for Jonah.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.240
Come find me when you have
an exit strategy

25:03.284 --> 25:04.851
that'll actually work.

25:08.115 --> 25:10.378
Guys, go make sure

25:10.421 --> 25:12.075
he doesn't set off
one of the booby traps

25:12.119 --> 25:13.686
and kill himself
before we can collect.

25:42.453 --> 25:44.238
I found a way out, boss.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.590
Want me to round up
the crew?

25:48.634 --> 25:51.071
Um...

25:51.114 --> 25:52.812
One bay,
and the front office looks

25:52.855 --> 25:54.422
like the size of my bathroom.

25:54.465 --> 25:56.163
-It's such a rip-off.
I'm sorry

25:56.206 --> 25:58.252
-it didn't work out, kid.
-But we found another garage

25:58.295 --> 25:59.949
down the block
with a "For rent" sign.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.429
We're about to go peep
the inside.

26:01.472 --> 26:03.823
You sounded like Leroy just now.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.172
He said I sound like you.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.695
We're still on
for burgers tonight, right?

26:06.739 --> 26:08.001
One second.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.220
Uh, it's my dad.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.613
He's probably trying
to find me. Later.

26:18.489 --> 26:20.579
It locked me out
for one minute.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.015
Too many attempts.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.886
What have you tried so far?

26:23.930 --> 26:26.236
His birthday.
His mom's. His dog's.

26:26.280 --> 26:30.501
Even mine. And then I tried
zero-zero-zero-zero.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.025
Okay, uh, it's time
to get creative.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.853
Luca, what's
your password?

26:33.896 --> 26:35.637
Zero-zero-zero-zero.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.073
Well, what's yours?

26:37.117 --> 26:39.423
My anniversary with Bonnie,
so I don't forget.

26:39.467 --> 26:41.251
Did you and Jonah have
an anniversary, Mary?

26:41.295 --> 26:42.905
We haven't been together
a whole year yet,

26:42.949 --> 26:45.125
but our first date was
in September.

26:45.168 --> 26:46.779
Not that he'd remember.

26:46.822 --> 26:47.997
He's kind of bad with dates.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.042
It's worth a try.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.957
The whole thing
was so...

26:51.000 --> 26:52.349
surreal. I...

26:52.393 --> 26:53.786
I'd never even seen a real gun
before today.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.483
You're safe now, Mary.

26:55.526 --> 26:56.789
Jonah isn't.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.704
It makes no sense.
He and his dad

26:58.747 --> 27:00.488
barely talk.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.055
The man only cares
about himself.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.753
I keep telling him
to cut his losses, but...

27:04.797 --> 27:06.537
my guy's an optimist.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.365
I love that about him.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.281
Oh, wow.

27:11.325 --> 27:13.153
It <i>is</i> our anniversary.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.852
Just please let me know
as soon as you've found him.

27:16.896 --> 27:17.984
We will.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.507
Here we go.

27:19.550 --> 27:23.250
His backpack is way up
by Angeles National Forest.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.599
If he has his
pack with him,

27:24.643 --> 27:25.513
we got him.

27:25.556 --> 27:26.819
Okay?

27:36.698 --> 27:38.091
Car's gone.

27:41.616 --> 27:42.878
Where's Brady?

27:42.922 --> 27:44.663
-Where's Collins?
-Probably out

27:44.706 --> 27:45.925
grabbing fresh wheels.

27:47.883 --> 27:49.929
Jonah?

27:49.972 --> 27:52.540
This will all make sense
soon enough.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.979
I'm very sorry
for what I've put you through.

27:57.023 --> 27:59.547
I'm sorry for a lot
of the things I've done.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.114
But we're family.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.029
I love you.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.033
Please talk to me.

28:09.339 --> 28:10.950
Jonah?

28:10.993 --> 28:12.952
Are you okay?

28:12.995 --> 28:14.823
Help me move this.

28:22.918 --> 28:24.572
Where the hell
is my son?

28:24.615 --> 28:26.966
Call Brady!

28:30.360 --> 28:31.361
Straight to voice mail.

28:31.405 --> 28:32.580
I'll take a look around.

28:32.623 --> 28:33.929
Keep him here.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.414
30-David.

28:40.457 --> 28:41.632
One suspect leaving
the house.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.112
-He's armed.
We'll handle him.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.201
You and Stevens
-cover the one-side.
-Roger that.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.116
Street, cover the
-perimeter with 50-David.
-Roger.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.162
Tan, let's move.

28:56.952 --> 28:59.215
Two suspects inside.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.403
It's... not here!

29:16.755 --> 29:17.973
Dante?

29:18.017 --> 29:19.018
Brady?

29:19.061 --> 29:20.584
Call out!

29:22.673 --> 29:25.546
Whoever's there,
you're on private property.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.330
I have the right
to use deadly force against you.

29:30.159 --> 29:31.900
Aah!

29:31.944 --> 29:34.250
LAPD! Stop
right there!

29:34.294 --> 29:36.209
LAPD!

29:36.252 --> 29:37.384
Tan! Cover!

29:56.795 --> 29:57.926
Tan! Get down!

29:59.101 --> 30:00.624
Tan!

30:05.847 --> 30:07.240
Tan.

30:07.283 --> 30:09.285
Tan! Are you all right?

30:12.811 --> 30:14.073
Vest saved your life, man.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.030
We got to move.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.553
20-David. We need backup.

30:16.597 --> 30:17.685
Let me get you out of here.

30:19.078 --> 30:20.340
Behind you!

30:42.275 --> 30:43.885
On your stomach!

30:43.929 --> 30:45.017
Stay down!

30:45.060 --> 30:47.149
Don't even think about it.

30:47.193 --> 30:48.498
Don't die for a paycheck, man.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.892
It's not your war anymore.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.373
Well, at least you're vertical.
You all right?

30:53.416 --> 30:56.593
-Second hit this year.
-Let's make it your last, man.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.552
-How'd you spot the trap?
-I saw the metal in the bushes.

30:58.595 --> 31:01.250
Motion-activated
remote trigger, right?

31:01.294 --> 31:03.209
I have the right
to remain silent.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.776
Yes, you do.
This is 20-David.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.909
Suspect in custody.
Any sign of Jonah

31:07.953 --> 31:09.911
-or Brady?
-Negative.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.652
Just his backpack.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.959
Roger that.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.917
<i>All right,
thanks for letting me know.</i>

31:15.961 --> 31:18.789
But please tell his mom
how sorry I am.

31:21.531 --> 31:23.272
That was Valdez.

31:23.316 --> 31:26.449
Agent Grayson died
during surgery.

31:26.493 --> 31:28.974
How's Valdez holding up?

31:31.977 --> 31:34.936
Hardest day of my whole career
was losing Erika,

31:34.980 --> 31:37.025
and having to notify her sister.

31:37.069 --> 31:41.116
SWAT trains you for a lot,
but... never that.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.901
Yeah.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.556
Already one mother's
lost her son today.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.907
Let's make sure Jonah's mother
has a different ending.

31:50.256 --> 31:52.127
Yes, sir.

31:56.523 --> 31:57.741
The FBI agent

31:57.785 --> 31:59.439
shot this morning?

31:59.482 --> 32:01.876
He just died.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.966
Which means your son is
being held by a murderer.

32:05.010 --> 32:08.013
Do you have any idea where
Brady could be taking your boy?

32:08.056 --> 32:09.971
Anything he said,
anything you saw?

32:10.015 --> 32:12.104
No. We were all
at the cabin together.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.496
I needed some air.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.194
When I came back in,
they were both gone.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.891
They were just... gone.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.939
I would tell you if I knew.

32:20.982 --> 32:24.377
I may be a terrible father, but
I would never intentionally...

32:24.420 --> 32:26.161
It doesn't mean
you don't love your son.

32:26.205 --> 32:27.684
You could be partway to China

32:27.728 --> 32:29.208
if you had just left Jonah
out of it.

32:29.251 --> 32:30.470
Why did you grab him?

32:30.513 --> 32:33.212
He was my exit plan.

32:33.255 --> 32:34.996
Help me out here.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.998
Hoffenberg, Madoff--

32:37.042 --> 32:38.826
I'm smarter than they were.

32:38.869 --> 32:42.003
When I started my account,
I knew I could crash and burn,

32:42.047 --> 32:43.787
and so I planned in advance.

32:43.831 --> 32:45.441
I opened up a Swiss bank account

32:45.485 --> 32:47.095
in Jonah's name
when he turned 12,

32:47.139 --> 32:52.971
and loaded it up
year after year-- $130 million.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.276
An escape hatch.

32:55.321 --> 32:56.800
Jonah never knew about it?

32:56.844 --> 32:58.977
I couldn't count
on cooperation.

32:59.020 --> 33:01.457
I had full control over
the account until he was 18.

33:01.501 --> 33:04.547
I was going to transfer
the funds into a new account.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.071
Then the Feds started
poking around.

33:06.114 --> 33:07.594
You couldn't move the money

33:07.637 --> 33:08.769
without raising
any red flags, right?

33:08.812 --> 33:10.118
Jonah turned 18,

33:10.162 --> 33:11.902
I needed him
to access the funds.

33:11.946 --> 33:15.167
That's... that's why
I couldn't leave him behind.

33:15.210 --> 33:17.908
-Did you tell Brady about this?
-No, of course not.

33:17.952 --> 33:20.563
But I had the statements
for the account inside my bag,

33:20.607 --> 33:22.826
along with all
of the other information

33:22.870 --> 33:26.178
for Jonah to zero out
his own account, and, uh,

33:26.221 --> 33:27.657
I saw
the statements were missing

33:27.701 --> 33:29.398
just before
you broke down the door.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.400
So Brady figured out
that Jonah was a bigger asset

33:31.444 --> 33:33.098
than you were,
and easier to handle.

33:33.141 --> 33:35.361
I should have never
put Jonah into this.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.580
Do you really think
you could save my son?

33:39.626 --> 33:41.715
We're gonna try.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.891
How you feeling?

33:43.934 --> 33:45.327
Lucky.

33:45.371 --> 33:46.937
I'm very glad for that.

33:46.981 --> 33:48.548
Were you able
to squeeze any info

33:48.591 --> 33:50.158
out of the two mercs
from the cabin?

33:50.202 --> 33:51.768
Roger Irving,
ex-Delta Force.

33:51.812 --> 33:54.336
And Jeffrey Dante,
ex-Green Beret.

33:54.380 --> 33:56.208
Both of them very willing
to cooperate now.

33:56.251 --> 33:58.079
Zero honor among thieves.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.038
Either of them know
-where Brady took Jonah?
-No.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.474
But they gave up the fourth man
on Brady's team--

34:01.517 --> 34:03.563
Michael Collins,
ex-Marine Raider.

34:03.606 --> 34:04.825
Special Ops has

34:04.868 --> 34:06.783
a lot to answer for
with these guys.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.655
We checked his contacts
in the L.A. area.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.091
Well, it turns out
Collins has a cousin,

34:10.135 --> 34:12.050
Scott Young,
operates an offshore

34:12.093 --> 34:13.616
supply ship that docked
at the Port of L.A.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.488
two days ago
to refuel and reload.

34:15.531 --> 34:17.707
-Mm-hmm.
-It's scheduled
to depart tomorrow.

34:17.751 --> 34:20.188
Interesting.

34:20.232 --> 34:22.103
It's an update
from Vessel Traffic Control.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.757
Young moved up his departure.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.411
Scheduled to leave
in 20 minutes.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.630
Smart money says
Jonah's on that boat.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.284
20 minutes to get
-to San Pedro?
-I'll tell Air Support

34:29.328 --> 34:31.504
to prep the bird. Go.

34:55.397 --> 34:59.271
We are casting off
in two minutes.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.360
So, we'll, uh...

35:01.403 --> 35:03.101
Are you hungry?

35:03.144 --> 35:04.580
Yeah, he's...

35:04.624 --> 35:07.366
I got to keep my...
my golden goose fed.

35:09.629 --> 35:13.589
Oh, uh, not even a squeak,

35:13.633 --> 35:15.809
or else I call my guys

35:15.852 --> 35:18.159
and have 'em cut
your daddy's throat.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.118
Understood?

36:15.347 --> 36:16.391
Drop your weapon!

36:16.435 --> 36:17.523
Drop it!

36:19.177 --> 36:20.308
Hands on your head! Don't move!

36:20.352 --> 36:21.483
30-David. One suspect down,

36:21.527 --> 36:22.702
one in custody.

36:22.745 --> 36:23.529
No sign of Jonah or Brady.

36:23.572 --> 36:24.965
Copy that.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.495
LAPD!

36:35.497 --> 36:36.803
Hondo, on your six.

36:40.850 --> 36:43.026
There's an open hatch maybe 15
feet behind him. Keep him busy.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.030
Stay right there!

36:47.074 --> 36:48.858
-Not another step!
-Mr. Brady,

36:48.902 --> 36:50.730
we just want to end this
peacefully. So do you.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.558
-Nobody needs to get hurt.
Come any closer,

36:52.601 --> 36:54.255
Jonah here gets a bullet.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.256
Which would be sad

36:55.300 --> 36:56.779
for the kid,

36:56.823 --> 36:58.607
but he's gonna die
before I do.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.349
You hearing me?!

37:01.393 --> 37:02.524
Yeah. Let's figure
out a better plan.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.439
How about a chopper,
fully fueled?

37:04.483 --> 37:07.486
You can be in Tijuana by
happy hour. Just give us Jonah.

37:07.529 --> 37:10.967
I want you to back away
in five seconds, or I empty

37:11.011 --> 37:12.012
half my mag into the kid.

37:12.055 --> 37:14.841
Five, four.

37:14.884 --> 37:15.885
-Come on, Hondo.
-Three!

37:20.412 --> 37:21.369
Stay down!

37:21.413 --> 37:23.415
-You got him, Tan?
-Yeah.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.851
Hands behind your back now!

37:26.156 --> 37:27.723
Jonah, you're okay.
We got you.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.509
Mary's okay.
She's in the hospital.

37:30.552 --> 37:32.075
What about my dad?

37:32.119 --> 37:33.860
Is he okay?

37:35.122 --> 37:37.777
He's been arrested,
but he's safe.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.346
This is 20-David,
we're Code 4.

37:41.389 --> 37:44.305
Hostage unharmed.
Suspects in custody.

37:57.536 --> 38:00.539
After-action's done.
Just missing your signature.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.455
I'll get to it in a bit.
How's Jonah?

38:03.498 --> 38:08.111
First question he asked--
was his dad okay.

38:08.155 --> 38:09.635
After everything
his father did to him.

38:09.678 --> 38:12.507
My son and I put each other
through hell,

38:12.551 --> 38:16.555
but when it's all said and done,
we're still father and son.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.383
That's a tough
bond to break.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.908
Or to fake.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.217
How's Darryl?

38:28.654 --> 38:30.960
Still staying out of trouble?

38:31.004 --> 38:34.573
Yeah... for now.

38:34.616 --> 38:36.662
See you tomorrow,
Commander.

38:42.885 --> 38:45.061
Hey, good night, Sergeant.
Hope the kids enjoy your demo.

38:46.628 --> 38:48.456
Turns out I won't
be doing the demo.

38:48.500 --> 38:51.372
Some other parents don't want
a cop in the classroom.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.635
We used to be the good guys.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.724
Yeah, before cancel
culture took over.

38:55.768 --> 38:58.466
How do you cancel the police?

38:58.510 --> 39:00.860
I know these parents.
Shadow in the driveway,

39:00.903 --> 39:02.644
they are speed-dialing 911
for help.

39:05.386 --> 39:06.605
Why are you here so late?

39:08.389 --> 39:10.304
I was hoping our kid'll be
asleep by the time I got there.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.176
Well, that's honest.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.656
I had no idea
how hard this was gonna be.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.397
Annie's kind of
an expert on toddlers.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.181
Why don't you
and the family come over

39:18.225 --> 39:19.879
for dinner Friday night?

39:19.922 --> 39:22.185
She can share some
of her sleep management tips,

39:22.229 --> 39:23.926
and, uh, we can celebrate
your first week on SWAT.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.798
Check with your wife,
let me know.

39:25.841 --> 39:27.452
Uh, I'm saying "yes" for
both of us right now.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.105
Jenna would just be happy
to talk to survivors.

39:34.415 --> 39:35.503
What's up?

39:37.462 --> 39:40.900
So, um, I did some thinking
after you left.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.685
Like, real thinking.

39:43.729 --> 39:46.601
How I'm always the tough
chick who helps other people.

39:46.645 --> 39:49.430
Helped, uh, Erika get dead.

39:49.474 --> 39:52.041
Chris, you got to stop this.
What does Dr. Wendy call it?

39:52.085 --> 39:53.260
-Negative rumination?
-I know.

39:53.303 --> 39:55.828
I'm a mess.

39:55.871 --> 39:59.875
Vodka wears off, and Erika's
still dead, and I feel worse.

39:59.919 --> 40:02.443
But I, um...
I checked around.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.402
And there's a community
center near here

40:04.445 --> 40:06.969
that has a grief group
this evening.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.886
Could you maybe come with me?

40:10.930 --> 40:13.236
Your wheels or mine?

40:13.280 --> 40:15.500
Yours.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.719
I'll go slow.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.242
Is that a threat or a promise?

40:40.046 --> 40:43.179
Hey, D, it's Hondo.
What's your ETA?

40:43.223 --> 40:45.834
I'm heating up that grill pan,
and I got your favorite fries.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.883
Hey, kid.

40:50.926 --> 40:53.842
That's me on your voice mail.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.496
-Hope you're hungry.
-Oh, nah, man.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.803
I just ate Mexican
with my dad.

40:57.846 --> 41:01.459
Oh, I completely forgot.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.417
Um, c-can we do it tomorrow?

41:04.897 --> 41:06.942
Sure.

41:06.986 --> 41:09.379
What are you gonna eat?

41:09.423 --> 41:10.598
I got a whole enchilada in here
I haven't touched.

41:10.642 --> 41:11.947
No, it's all good.

41:11.991 --> 41:14.210
There's room in the fridge.
Give me that.

41:16.212 --> 41:18.519
So, how'd the second garage go?

41:18.563 --> 41:20.782
It was right.

41:20.826 --> 41:22.567
We're gonna take it.

41:22.610 --> 41:24.133
Oh, yeah? Nice.

41:24.177 --> 41:25.613
Can't wait to see it.

41:27.572 --> 41:29.922
So I'm sure you got
some homework to do, right?

41:29.965 --> 41:31.663
Oh, yeah.
I'm-a sit with you.

41:31.706 --> 41:33.186
Nah, nah, no need.

41:33.229 --> 41:35.231
You go handle your business.

41:35.275 --> 41:36.494
You're not gonna slack
on my account.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.539
Keep hustling,

41:38.583 --> 41:41.020
keep grinding,
putting in the work.

41:41.063 --> 41:41.934
My pops tell you that?

41:41.977 --> 41:43.805
Nah, my dad always says it.

41:43.849 --> 41:45.764
Kept him alive in prison.

41:45.807 --> 41:47.156
Solid words, right?

41:47.200 --> 41:49.376
No doubt.

41:49.419 --> 42:12.051
Peace.
