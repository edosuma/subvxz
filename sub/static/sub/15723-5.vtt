00:02.169 --> 00:04.171
Hira's dead, David.

00:04.171 --> 00:06.465
Yes, she's dead.

00:06.465 --> 00:08.383
Hira took a bullet that's it. Game over.

00:08.383 --> 00:09.968
We move on.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.765
You made her feel ashamed.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.975
You!

00:16.975 --> 00:19.269
You...

00:19.269 --> 00:20.395
Seen the game the other night?

00:20.395 --> 00:22.397
Yeah, what, Biriliski went through the boards?

00:22.397 --> 00:23.190
Yeah. I think it's..

00:23.190 --> 00:25.275
- Oh man, you're not...
- Why? You think that's dangerous?

00:25.275 --> 00:28.195
I don't think. I know.

00:28.195 --> 00:31.865
Got a situation developing in the States
related to a prion type disease.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.575
- Prion?
- Mad cow.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.993
- It's bullshit.
- I'm sorry?

00:34.993 --> 00:37.996
It takes at least 7 years
for a prion protein to fuck up the brain

00:37.996 --> 00:40.374
ans at least another year
after that before you die.

00:40.374 --> 00:44.378
She had this disease, something
only 60 or 70 year old people get.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.171
Old people, you know.

00:46.171 --> 00:49.299
Why? Why did this happen to my baby?

00:49.299 --> 00:51.677
How many people are we talking about?

00:51.677 --> 00:56.390
How many people ate a piece of chicken,
an egg, or got a flu shot lately?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

1x05- The Oldest Virus

02:38.075 --> 02:40.285
- This is the guy's office?
- Apparently.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.162
At the time being.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.997
Take a seat anywhere kids I'll be right with you.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.666
We're actually here to meet Harvey Thomas.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.084
Oh, um...

02:47.084 --> 02:48.293
Not here yet.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.296
- I'll point him out when he gets here.
- Thank you.

02:57.261 --> 03:01.890
I guess after Thomas' lab went bankrupt,
the creditors really came after him.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.269
- He doesn't have much left.
- Here you go.

03:05.269 --> 03:06.186
Thank you.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.897
Made him a little gunshy.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.774
You hungry?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.995
David, David!

03:22.995 --> 03:25.163
David Sandstrom. Harvey Thomas.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.081
Thomas' laboratories.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.584
I was under the impression
that you were coming alone.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.878
David is our chief scientist, Dr Thomas.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.880
He's the one got us to you.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.464
How so?

03:34.464 --> 03:38.177
Well, you've been working on a prion vaccine, right?

03:38.177 --> 03:42.890
See we detected antibodies
to Avian Leukemia Viruses in some human blood.

03:42.890 --> 03:43.974
It happens.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.685
ALV shows up in a lot of early vaccine cultures.

03:46.685 --> 03:51.190
Hey, Harv' relax. I'm not here
to take away the swimming pool, okay?

03:51.982 --> 03:53.984
All right.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.196
As I told Carol here, yes,
we were working on a prion vaccine,

03:57.196 --> 03:59.573
we had close to 30 million in the project.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.200
And then you dropped it?

04:01.200 --> 04:01.867
I had no choice.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.577
- Have you ordered breakfast?
- No thanks.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.578
We already... uh.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.788
What happened?

04:06.788 --> 04:10.167
We were close. We were very close
to coming up with the vaccine.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.586
After animal trials, we hit a brick wall.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.670
Why?

04:13.670 --> 04:16.298
We couldn't find any human volunteers.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.882
Mad cow.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.676
Scared the bejesus out of everybody.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.095
We couldn't pay people to be subjects.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.681
- There you go.
- Thanks.

04:24.681 --> 04:28.477
- Um... Are you 2 ready..
- Uh.. We're fine, actually.

04:28.477 --> 04:32.564
What happened to the recombinant prions
in the viral vectors that you created?

04:32.564 --> 04:34.566
Repossession court.

04:34.566 --> 04:38.695
Last asset I had... The only chance
I have of refinancing the lab.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.865
- Sandi, could I get.
- Can we get a sample?

04:42.491 --> 04:43.075
What for?

04:43.075 --> 04:46.078
We'd like to compare them
to some prion samples we found.

04:46.078 --> 04:50.582
Found? Where do you find prion samples?

04:50.582 --> 04:53.001
In four dead people.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.765
What's up?

05:06.765 --> 05:11.770
The kid from East LA and the most recent
victim... Both ate at Hoppen Chickens.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.565
45 franchises in California and Arizona.

05:14.565 --> 05:19.194
Sarah McKinley ate chicken tenders at Lord of the
Chicken at least 3 times in the last month.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.572
54 franchises throughout the southeast.

05:21.572 --> 05:25.075
Shasco Foods is
the wholesaler for both franchises.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.702
Well, what about the Texas veggie?

05:26.702 --> 05:29.872
Eggs. Starvest the Market.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.874
I'm on hold with the head office trying
to find out the whole sales.

05:31.874 --> 05:35.002
- Good going. 
- Thanks, I'll owe it to you.

05:35.002 --> 05:38.088
Telephony is old school Wes.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.466
Shit, did you guys change
the internet password again?

05:41.466 --> 05:41.967
Yeah.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.386
Carbon.

05:46.096 --> 05:49.183
Shasco Foods.

05:49.183 --> 05:53.270
Oh.. Number 1 egg distributor in the US.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.064
Weston, I think we have a common link.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.277
Got it Wes. Thanks.

06:00.277 --> 06:04.573
So the victims ate chicken and eggs supplied
by Wide Valley Farms.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.784
Wes set up a meeting
with their head of legal affairs.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.785
So where are we going?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.787
I'm going to see a lawyer in North Platt.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.789
You're going to a flu convention.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.167
No.. I should probably skip Chicago
and go with...

06:15.167 --> 06:20.297
David, are you gonna skip
a Spanish Flu convention to go to Nebraska?

06:20.297 --> 06:21.298
- No.
- Yeah.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.883
Thanks.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.676
What's this? We didn't order anything.

06:24.676 --> 06:25.886
Harvey did.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.688
Has there ever been a case of avian prions
found in humans?

06:36.688 --> 06:38.273
- No.
- I see.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.900
We're not talking about avian prion,

06:39.900 --> 06:42.569
we're talking about a human prion
in chickens and eggs.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.572
And you have proof that
our poultry products are contaminated?

06:45.572 --> 06:47.574
You've read our report
on where the victims ate.

06:47.574 --> 06:53.080
There are 200 million eggs and 20 million chickens
consumed every day in this country.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.083
Shasco suggested we start here, because
you're their biggest supplier.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.294
We're in price negotiations.
That's Shasco's leverage.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.796
Four people are dead.

07:00.796 --> 07:04.466
I certainly have enough to go public and
point a finger at Wide Valley Farm's chicken.

07:04.466 --> 07:08.387
- And you'd be willing to risk a lawsuit?
- You're willing to risk a PR nightmare?

07:12.891 --> 07:14.393
What is it you're asking for?

07:14.393 --> 07:17.771
We'd like you to hold all shipments
until we test your birds and eggs.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.899
You're asking us to put 50,000 people
out of work on a hunch?

07:20.899 --> 07:23.902
It's more than a hunch.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.071
You have no authority
over the food system. The FDA does.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.782
And we'll be going to the FDA
when we have proof.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.493
And we'll comply with
whatever the FDA recommends.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.496
We're asking for voluntary compliance now.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.001
We'll provide samples.

07:39.001 --> 07:42.379
But until you provide proof that
Wide Valley chicken is tainted,

07:42.880 --> 07:44.798
we keep shipping our product.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.803
Thank you.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.479
So this postdoc comes to me
with this brilliant theory on target binding,

07:59.479 --> 08:01.982
and I knew we'll screw up...
Maybe 1% chance of going anywhere,

08:01.982 --> 08:04.193
but to not try would have been crazy.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.987
And everyone was saying:
"Don't go there. Don't go there."

08:06.987 --> 08:09.072
What happened?

08:09.072 --> 08:12.284
I told her to go for it. And she listened to me.
And she was wrong.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.077
You knew she was gonna fail?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.288
There is only 99% sure.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.998
Where is she now?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.666
Med school.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.294
- Poor kid.
- David!

08:22.294 --> 08:26.298
Hey. Uh.. Thanks for
the volatile hydroxyl compounds.

08:26.298 --> 08:27.466
What the fuck are you doing here?

08:27.466 --> 08:32.095
I thought you might like a couple of tickets
to a hockey game. That..

08:32.095 --> 08:33.597
I'm playing it tonight.

08:33.597 --> 08:34.765
You made the cut.

08:34.765 --> 08:35.765
2 week charm.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.269
That's great, man. Fantastic!
You know... for an old guy.

08:39.269 --> 08:39.977
Fuck you.

08:39.977 --> 08:43.065
I'll buy you a drink.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.192
So you know that kid, Arvintchek?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.569
Yeah, with LA... Kid's a monster.
What's he like, 6'9?

08:47.569 --> 08:48.570
Uh hu.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.990
Budy checked him out. Called night. *

08:51.990 --> 08:53.992
No. I'm doing good.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.703
Good.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.581
What?

08:59.581 --> 09:02.876
I'm playing with this guy Archembault, 32.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.088
Had a heart attack.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.298
Is he okay?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.467
- Heart exploded, David.
- Jesus..

09:10.467 --> 09:12.678
What are you not telling me, Danny?

09:12.678 --> 09:14.972
I'm playing with fuckin' kids who were
in diapers when I broke in.

09:14.972 --> 09:17.266
A lot of them chewin' roids since junior high.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.685
I gotta take this shit just to fuckin'
keep the level playing field.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.895
What did you take?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.480
I don't know.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.898
Is it the same stuff as
Biriliski and Archembault?

09:27.484 --> 09:32.698
- One time, one shot. That's all it was.
- That's all it takes with synthetic hormones.

09:33.365 --> 09:39.496
David, if I can't play...
This is my life man. This is all I know.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.290
All right, give me a sample, okay?

09:41.290 --> 09:42.499
I can't.

09:42.499 --> 09:46.795
I can't. The fuckin' guy took off.
I don't know where he is.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.383
- What? Am I gonna...
- I don't know.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.386
- You got a cardiologist?
- Come on, David.

09:54.386 --> 09:58.265
Get one. Get on a treadmill,
have yourself checked out.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.474
I'm fine.

09:59.474 --> 10:04.104
So were Biriliski and Archembault, right?

10:05.397 --> 10:08.400
Order another round.
I'm gonna hit the can.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.380
- Hey.
- Gentlemen, thank you for the

10:30.380 --> 10:32.466
volatile hydroxil compounds.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.890
- Hi Hal.
- Hey, Jill. How are you?

10:39.890 --> 10:40.891
I'm well. How are you?

10:40.891 --> 10:42.267
I'm good, good.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.604
Jill Langston, MIT.
Calpinder Singh, CALTECH.

10:45.604 --> 10:46.772
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

10:46.772 --> 10:47.981
What are you drinkin', Jill?

10:47.981 --> 10:49.775
Club soda please.

10:49.775 --> 10:52.486
So gentlemen..

10:52.486 --> 10:55.572
I need the abstract on David Sandstrom.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.075
I've been offered
a senior position in his lab.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.701
Brilliant researcher,

11:00.285 --> 11:01.370
arrogant,

11:01.495 --> 11:04.498
and has a history of treating
his research people like shit.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.083
- Ah..
- I know.

11:06.083 --> 11:09.378
- He had to see a young postdoc once.
- You won't believe this.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.092
Yeah, I just got in. What's up?

11:15.092 --> 11:17.177
I got a district court judge
to cut through Thomas' creditors.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.304
Good. We get a sample?

11:19.304 --> 11:21.390
There weren't any to get.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.391
What are you talking about?

11:22.391 --> 11:24.685
Missing, stolen, hidden, we don't know.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.103
What did Thomas say?

11:26.103 --> 11:28.188
He didn't say anything.
We can't find him.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.275
Caroline, you realize if there are
prions in the food chain,

11:31.275 --> 11:33.068
and stored samples are missing...

11:56.675 --> 11:59.887
I'm not here.

12:05.475 --> 12:09.479
All right, I'm coming.

12:09.479 --> 12:13.483
I'm packing heat.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.694
All right, all right.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.866
What?

12:20.866 --> 12:22.701
Good morning.

12:23.285 --> 12:26.371
I'm Jill Langston. I'm here for my interview.

12:27.372 --> 12:31.168
- Caroline Morrison arranged it...
- No.. Not at 8 o'clock in the morning.

12:31.168 --> 12:34.004
That's insane. That's like 7 AM my time.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.797
No. That's 9 AM your time.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.967
- I could come back.
- No no.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.095
Come in, come in.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.974
Tell me about yourself, Jill.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.769
- You read my CV?
- Nope.

12:48.769 --> 12:49.895
Oh.

12:49.895 --> 12:56.276
Ah... Well, I did my undergrad
in molecular biology at Princeton.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.986
I'm listening.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.072
Ph.D. at Standford

13:00.072 --> 13:02.491
in virology with Colly Curie. *

13:02.491 --> 13:05.285
- My thesis was on..
- Time?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.995
I beg your pardon?

13:06.995 --> 13:09.498
On time? Was your thesis on time?

13:09.498 --> 13:11.500
Yes.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.587
Mine wasn't. It was
about 18 months late, actually.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.880
Wow, sometimes it..

13:16.880 --> 13:20.300
You can go to Stanford or Princeton
or any other fuckin' places.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.886
- Doesn't matter.
- Then why are you telling me?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.472
I'm sorry.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.683
- You asked me...
- To tell me about yourself.

13:27.683 --> 13:31.186
Your listing off institutions
like so many conquests.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.897
I'm looking for a new scientist.
Not a name dropper.

13:38.569 --> 13:41.780
I published 5 papers this year.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.991
Why don't you read them?

14:15.272 --> 14:17.691
Thomas said that his creditors
won't allow him to release the prions

14:17.691 --> 14:19.484
he made until the chapter 11 closes.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.070
Did you go to those creditors
and explained the situation?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.071
Of course.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.283
Apparently they value of their asset is
more important than the value of a human life.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.999
What is that?

14:33.999 --> 14:36.793
It looks like Wide Valley delivered their samples.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.886
So how many of these do we have coming?

14:45.886 --> 14:48.096
6 birds and a dozen eggs
from every operation.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.806
60 of operations.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.268
Okay, spines and branch with the highest
concentration of the prions we're looking for.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.270
Let's get as many people on this as possible.

14:55.270 --> 14:58.106
What if these guys turn up clean?

14:58.106 --> 14:59.983
Going to have one hell of a barbecue.

15:11.286 --> 15:12.788
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

15:12.788 --> 15:15.999
Do we know how the
prions got in the chickens?

15:15.999 --> 15:19.086
No. But we have a hunch it has
something to do with Harvey Thomas.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.295
Why?

15:20.295 --> 15:24.091
He's missing, David. Along with
the prion samples he promised us.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.593
Well, I thought they were
in a repossession court lock up.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.971
Yeah, we checked. Nothing.

15:31.306 --> 15:31.974
Thank you.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.268
The FBI's been running a profile on him.

15:34.268 --> 15:37.980
He travelled to North Platt
several times in passed couple months.

15:37.980 --> 15:41.191
As in... Chicken capital of the world
North Platt?

15:41.191 --> 15:42.401
Yeah.

15:42.401 --> 15:44.570
All right. Well, thanks for the update.

15:44.570 --> 15:45.279
Sure.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.989
How is your interview with Jill Langston?

15:46.989 --> 15:48.198
Who?

15:48.198 --> 15:51.493
Jill Langston, the virologist
I wanted you to meet?

15:52.578 --> 15:54.580
Uhh...

15:54.580 --> 15:56.707
Great. Jill. Great. Went great.

15:56.707 --> 15:59.084
We'd be lucky to get her, David.

16:01.086 --> 16:04.673
Yeah well, I'm not exactly sure
she's interested in the position.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.008
You want her?

16:06.008 --> 16:07.968
Do I want her? Do I want her...

16:07.968 --> 16:10.179
- Okay, get back to me on that one.
- Okay.

16:10.179 --> 16:12.097
- Uh.. Keep me up on the chickens.
- Sure.

16:12.097 --> 16:12.890
Goodbye.

16:13.891 --> 16:17.186
The most devastating pandemic in history.

16:17.186 --> 16:22.482
We know that at least 40 million people
died between 1918 and 1919.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.278
And now it was said of the Spanish flu
that you felt a little ill at breakfast,

16:26.278 --> 16:29.907
went to bed after lunch,
and were dead by dinner.

16:29.907 --> 16:34.286
The best sample we knew would be found in
a victim burried north of the permafrost line.

16:34.286 --> 16:38.498
But our field crew failed
to find a sample with intact viral RNA.

16:38.498 --> 16:43.670
Nevertheless, I was able to sequence
the 4th of the 8 segments polymerase.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.672
The field samples were taken to..

16:45.672 --> 16:49.176
Thank you, yes. Yes. Please.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.094
Jill Langston.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.304
Dr. Sandstrom.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.389
- It's great lecture.
- Thank you.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.974
So how did you sequence polymerase?

16:55.974 --> 16:58.769
Well, that'll be in the paper I'm publishing
in Nature magazine.

16:58.769 --> 17:01.772
You got the sample from a brain.
Not a lung. Am I right?

17:01.772 --> 17:02.981
Good guess.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.398
It's how I did it.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.568
- You sequenced polymerase?
- 2 years ago.

17:06.568 --> 17:08.403
Bullshit. You didn't publish?

17:08.403 --> 17:10.696
Ah.. it's worthless unless you got the
entire genome.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.700
- Well, it's gonna be a incremental.
- Maybe.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.996
What would you say if I told you I've got a
lead on a perfect specimen?

17:18.789 --> 17:20.999
Mazeltov!

17:20.999 --> 17:24.086
Jill.. We should be
working together on this.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.296
Create a vaccine for the old lady,
you can't turn that down.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.881
Sure I can.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.800
My charms, some you'll get used to.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.593
You'll get used to my tail lights.

18:10.883 --> 18:14.803
Here is a model of the structural of the prion
from the Wide Valley chickens, on the right,

18:14.803 --> 18:17.598
and from our 4 victims, on the left.

18:17.598 --> 18:18.682
That's a match?

18:18.682 --> 18:21.185
Perfect match.

18:21.185 --> 18:23.604
So did we shutdown Wide Valley Farms?

18:23.604 --> 18:26.690
We notified the FDA at 7:15 this morning.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.109
And the bad news?

18:29.109 --> 18:31.403
In the last 6 weeks,
the Sioux City operations shipped

18:31.403 --> 18:34.990
950 thousand pounds
of chickens to Shasco,

18:34.990 --> 18:35.699
and over 2 million eggs.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.284
Where are we on Thomas?

18:37.284 --> 18:40.495
The FBI has him arriving
at Chicago at 9:15 this morning.

18:40.495 --> 18:40.996
Did they get him?

18:40.996 --> 18:41.997
Not yet.

18:41.997 --> 18:44.374
And I suppose no news
on the missing samples.

18:44.374 --> 18:47.586
I have a feeling that when
we get Thomas, we get the samples.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.191
Let me give you some advice.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.901
Ah.. Never take advice.

19:10.901 --> 19:12.402
You don't want to work at NorBAC?

19:12.402 --> 19:13.070
Okay.

19:13.070 --> 19:16.782
Cause we don't... Offer cash bonuses
or stock options, or...

19:16.782 --> 19:19.201
company card that sort of shit.

19:19.201 --> 19:23.705
You know. All we offer the smartest team
of scientists on the continent,

19:23.705 --> 19:28.710
complete intellectual freedom,
and the toughest biological problems.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.504
Did you rehearse that
in front of a mirror?

19:30.504 --> 19:32.172
Yeah. But it's all true.

19:32.172 --> 19:36.301
Wouldn't I be replacing someone
whose been shot?

19:36.301 --> 19:40.681
Yeah. Well, we'll offer you
free life insurance.

19:40.681 --> 19:42.099
Why the sudden change of heart?

19:42.099 --> 19:43.976
- Everything I do is sudden.
- Well that explains a lot.

19:43.976 --> 19:45.894
Explains why I want you
to come and work with me.

19:45.894 --> 19:46.770
No it doesn't.

19:46.770 --> 19:49.189
I understand you've been hold up
on some little island

19:49.189 --> 19:51.275
off the coast of Norway for the
last 2 years.

19:51.275 --> 19:51.900
Yeah.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.403
All that time cuttin'
through red tape just to

19:54.403 --> 19:57.072
dig up a couple of flu victims
from the permafrost?

19:57.072 --> 19:57.781
It was fun.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.408
I uh.. I admire. Really, I do.

19:59.408 --> 20:01.076
'cause personally I'd rather put a bullet
in my head

20:01.076 --> 20:02.786
than do all that bureaucratic bullshit.

20:02.786 --> 20:05.205
How how much of an asshole
was I this morning?

20:05.205 --> 20:07.082
You were up there.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.792
Excuse me, doctor.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.687
- I'm looking for Carlos Serrano.
- He's out.

20:28.687 --> 20:30.397
I'm suppose to give blood today.

20:30.397 --> 20:34.401
Oh, you're Danny Dexter, the hockey player.
Mayko Tran.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.987
Oh hey, do you used to uh..

20:36.987 --> 20:39.573
Yeah. Okay, come over here.
I can do it for you.

20:39.573 --> 20:43.202
Can you get me blood case?

20:43.202 --> 20:45.204
So you uh.. a doctor too?

20:45.204 --> 20:48.290
Ph.D. bioinformatics.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.375
Bio what?

20:50.375 --> 20:52.794
I analyze and interpret
biomolecular data.

20:52.794 --> 20:56.590
It's where computer science meets biology.

20:56.590 --> 20:58.175
That's my beat.

20:58.175 --> 21:02.596
So you and David
when he was um... a kid, right?

21:02.596 --> 21:04.806
Since grade six, yeah.

21:04.806 --> 21:05.807
What was he like?

21:05.807 --> 21:11.104
He was a funny, skinny weird little guy
who lived day and night like a butterfly.

21:11.104 --> 21:14.900
All... right.

21:14.900 --> 21:15.776
That's it.

21:15.776 --> 21:17.277
- Can you hold that?
- Yeah.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.780
- Painless.
- Uh hu.

21:19.780 --> 21:22.491
How is my biomolecular data?

21:22.491 --> 21:25.994
We will tell you tomorrow.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.871
I lied.

21:27.871 --> 21:32.793
David was not weird or nerdy.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.586
He was brilliant.

21:34.586 --> 21:36.588
Brilliant at hiding the fact
that he was brilliant.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.006
And...

21:38.006 --> 21:40.175
I was the only one
who really knew him.

21:40.175 --> 21:42.386
And I don't why he chose me.

21:42.386 --> 21:44.096
Maybe you're a good listener.

21:44.096 --> 21:47.182
Yeah... that or I got him a lot of dates.

21:49.393 --> 21:51.687
What about you Mayko?

21:52.396 --> 21:54.273
Can I get you a date?

21:54.273 --> 21:56.984
Uh.. No, thank you.

21:56.984 --> 22:00.988
Yeah you don't really need me
to do anything, do you?

22:00.988 --> 22:01.989
Okay.

22:01.989 --> 22:03.907
I gotta run.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.993
I have a hockey practice and you have to

22:05.993 --> 22:08.996
analyze and interpret my biomolecular data.

22:08.996 --> 22:12.499
Yes. I will dig into your genes right now.

22:13.292 --> 22:16.712
- That's gonna be a handful.
- Oh, I'll manage.

22:16.712 --> 22:17.880
Bye.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.372
Yeah, hey Carlos.

22:52.372 --> 22:55.000
Guess what made
the headlines in Chicago.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.171
Sam Biriliski died of
mitro valve prolapse (MVP).

22:59.171 --> 23:00.797
That doesn't sound right.

23:00.797 --> 23:05.093
Any dumb ass team doctor would have
picked up MVP during a routine physical.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.386
Let me look into it.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.805
Yeah. Do it. How are things your way?

23:08.805 --> 23:10.807
Uh.. We're up to our culo in chickens.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.309
Anything yet?

23:12.309 --> 23:14.603
I should get
the first test results back tonight.

23:14.603 --> 23:17.272
Okay. I'll call you tomorrow.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.109
Hey!

23:21.109 --> 23:21.693
Hey.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.779
How goes the career decision making?

23:23.779 --> 23:25.781
It's very well.

23:25.781 --> 23:26.990
Did you make up your mind?

23:26.990 --> 23:30.410
Actually, I was just speaking
with your favorite pharmaceutical exec.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.288
And we came to terms.

23:33.705 --> 23:36.500
He'll go his way and I'll go mine.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.085
Do you still want me?

23:41.380 --> 23:43.590
I thought everything you did was sudden.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.509
Champagne?

23:45.509 --> 23:46.301
Yes.

23:46.301 --> 23:47.010
Please.

23:47.010 --> 23:49.972
Excuse me. I'd like to get
a bottle of Henry Pan, '97.

23:49.972 --> 23:53.100
Actually, have you ever tried
Crystal Caleche?

23:53.100 --> 23:57.104
We'll.. get one of each. Compare.

23:59.898 --> 24:01.275
So what made you change your mind?

24:01.275 --> 24:09.992
Well, Caroline Morrison called and raised the
offer by 25% and threw in a company card.

24:13.287 --> 24:14.788
When did you get in?

24:14.788 --> 24:15.789
Last night.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.583
And you didn't call?

24:17.583 --> 24:20.794
Well, it was after midnight
and I thought you'd be in bed.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.880
I was.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.174
You should have called.

24:25.174 --> 24:27.176
God, you lookin' great Caroline.

24:27.176 --> 24:28.886
You too Digby.

24:28.886 --> 24:30.679
How long are you in town for?

24:30.679 --> 24:34.308
I'm on a flight tonight, but I thought I'd touch
base with you on the Miranda Virus.

24:34.308 --> 24:36.977
- It's a tough one.
- How you doing on the vaccine?

24:36.977 --> 24:39.396
I just got a report here.

24:39.396 --> 24:43.483
They were able to grow
the Miranda Virus in a 293 cell culture.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.278
I'm an MI-5 agent.
Not a scientist, Caroline.

24:46.278 --> 24:47.905
What are we talking
about here in english?

24:47.905 --> 24:51.408
It means we were successful
with step 1 toward a vaccine.

24:51.408 --> 24:54.286
But we have about another
half dozen steps to go.

24:54.286 --> 24:55.787
What have you got?

24:55.787 --> 24:58.582
Well, our baby bomber Jamieson
dropped the alias Zanzinger

24:58.582 --> 24:59.875
and was tracked to a hotel in Scotland.

24:59.875 --> 25:01.585
But um.. Then we lost him.

25:01.585 --> 25:03.003
Did you get anything?

25:03.003 --> 25:05.589
His hotel room was clean but then
when we took apart the bathroom sink,

25:05.589 --> 25:09.676
we found some dental floss.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.886
So if you could just see if it's him.

25:10.886 --> 25:13.889
See if the DNA makes him
the father of Miranda.

25:13.889 --> 25:16.099
We'll get right on it.

25:16.099 --> 25:19.186
So I guess that's it then.

25:19.186 --> 25:21.980
Yeah.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.690
Well.

25:24.399 --> 25:27.986
Caroline, I think that we should um..

25:27.986 --> 25:29.613
I think we should just work

25:29.613 --> 25:32.074
extremely close together on this one.
I mean, if anything

25:32.074 --> 25:33.075
starts to heat up.

25:33.075 --> 25:33.909
If?

25:33.909 --> 25:35.702
They heat up?

25:35.702 --> 25:37.704
You mean, when they heat up.

25:39.081 --> 25:42.209
I expect you to make things happen, Digby.

25:42.209 --> 25:45.087
Glad to be in about you again Caroline. *

25:45.087 --> 25:48.590
You should called last night.

25:54.096 --> 25:57.474
- To you.
- To you.

26:05.691 --> 26:07.901
I'm hungry.

26:11.113 --> 26:13.699
Excuse me.

26:13.699 --> 26:16.285
We would like to see a menu, please.

26:16.285 --> 26:18.203
I'm sorry the restaurant is closed.

26:18.203 --> 26:22.207
Only way to get food now
is to order room service.

26:22.207 --> 26:25.711
All right, then.
We will order room service

26:25.711 --> 26:27.379
and we'll have it sent here.

26:27.379 --> 26:30.174
You're very clever man.

26:30.174 --> 26:32.885
You must be in your room.

26:32.885 --> 26:37.181
Apparently the emphasis
is on 'room' and not 'service'.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.402
Doctor.

26:50.402 --> 26:53.614
We're being very unprofessional.

26:53.614 --> 26:56.783
We're gonna be working together.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.286
We gotta stop.

26:59.286 --> 27:00.996
David.

27:00.996 --> 27:05.501
Can't 2 grown drunk people
act like 2 grown drunk people?

27:05.501 --> 27:07.002
Uh hu..

27:13.509 --> 27:18.597
- I hate these conventions.
- Yeah, same old shit.

27:18.597 --> 27:21.808
- I thought you liked my lecture.
- Oh yeah you really smart.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.312
And I'm really fun too.

27:25.312 --> 27:29.107
- I know all about you virologist.
- Really?

27:29.775 --> 27:30.776
Uh hu.

27:30.776 --> 27:32.277
Prove it.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.414
Hey.

27:44.414 --> 27:45.874
Hi.

27:45.874 --> 27:48.210
Ahh..

27:48.210 --> 27:49.795
On your way?

27:49.795 --> 27:52.589
Yeah, I got an early flight.

27:52.589 --> 27:55.008
No goodbyes.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.386
See you at the lab next week.

27:57.386 --> 27:58.303
David.

27:58.303 --> 28:01.598
I know.

28:01.598 --> 28:06.603
I'm gonna meet
with Mastertech Pharmaceutical.

28:06.603 --> 28:09.314
I think...

28:09.314 --> 28:13.694
I know I accepted your offer.

28:13.694 --> 28:16.488
Last night complicates things.

28:16.488 --> 28:18.282
So....

28:18.282 --> 28:19.908
I'm gonna need to think about it.

28:19.908 --> 28:21.994
Yeah well, you know, of course.

28:21.994 --> 28:24.997
Because Mastertech is a great company
and San Francisco

28:24.997 --> 28:28.292
is San Francisco.

28:28.292 --> 28:31.587
- So can I take a couple of days?
- Sure.

28:32.379 --> 28:36.300
And I buy another bottle of champagne
next flu convention?

28:43.891 --> 28:46.476
Goodbye David.

28:47.686 --> 28:50.480
Goodbye sounded kind of permanent.

29:04.578 --> 29:07.998
Missed me already?

29:09.082 --> 29:11.877
- Dr. David Sandstrom?
- Yeah?

29:11.877 --> 29:13.712
You are?

29:13.712 --> 29:15.881
Ah.. Jesus.

29:15.881 --> 29:17.799
I uhh.. put some close on.

29:21.678 --> 29:25.098
Oh, thank you. Thank you for coming.

29:25.098 --> 29:27.476
I didn't really have much
of a choice there, Harv.

29:27.476 --> 29:29.478
FBI thinks
it's some kind of a lunatic.

29:29.478 --> 29:31.104
They are pretty smart bunch.

29:31.104 --> 29:33.315
- I know what I'm doing.
- Okay.

29:33.315 --> 29:35.192
I was coming to see you.

29:35.192 --> 29:39.780
You see, once I've found the perfect source
to put the prions, I had to do it.

29:39.780 --> 29:42.908
You infected the roosters
through their food, didn't you?

29:42.908 --> 29:43.909
Yeah.

29:43.909 --> 29:47.287
So they could transmit the prions to their offspring.

29:47.287 --> 29:50.499
How often does a rooster
go at it, d'you figure, Harv?

29:50.499 --> 29:52.000
Just curious.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.878
I believe 10 to 30 times a day.

29:54.878 --> 29:56.880
It's a lot of infected chickens.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.300
Well, sure. That's why I did it.

30:04.012 --> 30:06.098
Can't fix it 'til it's broken, is that it?

30:06.098 --> 30:08.600
Yeah. Yeah.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.602
You see.

30:10.602 --> 30:14.481
Prions, those little tiny proteins
can destroy us all.

30:14.481 --> 30:18.110
They're like a virus, a cancer.

30:18.110 --> 30:19.987
And I can cure them all.

30:19.987 --> 30:21.113
I know how.

30:21.113 --> 30:23.991
You want to tell that to the mother
of a little girl lying in a slab in Florida?

30:23.991 --> 30:26.910
No. That wasn't suppose to happen.

30:26.910 --> 30:31.915
I was gonna expose the prions in the Wide Valley
chicken and then show them I have a cure.

30:31.915 --> 30:35.377
You don't know that, Harvey.
You haven't tested your vaccine in humans yet.

30:35.377 --> 30:40.883
Yes, but now they'll have
to let me test it, won't they.

30:40.883 --> 30:43.177
You have the samples, don't you?

30:43.177 --> 30:45.095
They took them. Didn't they tell you?

30:45.095 --> 30:48.098
They didn't tell me anything
except you wanted to see me.

30:48.098 --> 30:50.601
I was bringing them to you,
so you could see it for yourself.

30:50.601 --> 30:51.393
You could test them.

30:51.393 --> 30:52.895
Oh, I'd love to have a look at them.

30:52.895 --> 30:57.608
And you'll see, and they'll have to
refinance my study, because I can save them.

30:57.608 --> 30:59.401
Sure you can, Harvey.

30:59.401 --> 31:03.989
All I needed is a year.
5 tops. That's all I need. I swear.

31:03.989 --> 31:06.116
5 tops eh?

31:06.116 --> 31:09.203
Well, my guess is they'll give you 10...

31:09.203 --> 31:11.205
to life.

31:11.205 --> 31:12.789
David, I'm sorry.

31:12.789 --> 31:15.792
Dr. Sandstrom.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.294
David.

31:21.507 --> 31:23.675
I just don't think
you should call me here.

31:23.675 --> 31:25.093
No ma'am, not right now.

31:25.093 --> 31:26.887
I need at least a week or two.

31:26.887 --> 31:28.514
I really have to go.

31:28.514 --> 31:30.807
I want to talk to you.

31:30.807 --> 31:32.976
Hey, David's back in town.

31:32.976 --> 31:34.686
How was the windy city?

31:34.686 --> 31:35.312
Ah..

31:35.312 --> 31:37.898
It was..

31:37.898 --> 31:40.692
You either got laid or arrested.

31:40.692 --> 31:43.695
Well, that for me to know
and you'll find out.

31:43.695 --> 31:44.488
Here.

31:44.488 --> 31:47.282
The missing prion samples,
courtesy of the FBI.

31:47.282 --> 31:49.493
We need to run those,
match 'em to what we've got.

31:49.493 --> 31:51.411
Prosecutions gonna want that eventually.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.913
- I'll get right on it.
- Okay.

31:52.913 --> 31:54.998
Bob.

31:54.998 --> 31:56.583
I have to go. Goodbye.

32:05.509 --> 32:07.010
You okay?

32:07.010 --> 32:08.887
Why?

32:08.887 --> 32:10.389
Never mind. You got anything
on Danny's hormones?

32:10.389 --> 32:12.015
- I have.
- Let's go.

32:18.689 --> 32:20.816
I just don't think
you should call me here.

32:20.816 --> 32:22.109
No ma'am, not right now.

32:22.109 --> 32:23.986
I need at least a week or two.

32:23.986 --> 32:28.991
- I really have to go.
- I want to talk to you.

32:28.991 --> 32:32.995
You don't understand. This is a government
operated lab I'm in now.

32:32.995 --> 32:36.582
I told you I don't know what they'll do
if they found out.

32:36.582 --> 32:39.793
- Miss Richmond, please.
- Bob.

32:39.793 --> 32:43.505
I have to go. Goodbye.

32:50.804 --> 32:52.097
You okay?

32:52.097 --> 32:53.891
Why?

32:53.891 --> 32:55.517
Never mind. You got anything
on Danny's hormones?

32:55.517 --> 32:57.311
- I have.
- Let's go.

32:57.311 --> 33:00.606
Mayko found a muscle hormone
that's being developed for *** in AIDS.

33:00.606 --> 33:04.193
The most advanced trials are being done
by a Atlanta biotech called Bioxene.

33:04.193 --> 33:05.903
I've heard of them.

33:05.903 --> 33:08.906
- Still interested in Biriliski?
- Ya, you talked to his team doctor?

33:08.906 --> 33:12.409
I did. He says he didn't pick up
mitro valve prolapse syndrome because

33:12.409 --> 33:14.912
Biriliski was born with a heart *problem*.

33:14.912 --> 33:19.917
That's why he exhibited
chest pains, signs of fatigue, dizziness.

33:19.917 --> 33:23.587
He said it because professional athletes
are used to working through their pain.

33:23.587 --> 33:25.589
Ah.. You speak bullshit too.

33:25.589 --> 33:27.216
Na, it's like a second language to me.

33:27.216 --> 33:29.092
Did you specifically ask about the doping?

33:29.092 --> 33:32.804
Oh, Biriliski passed every single test
the League threw at him.

33:32.804 --> 33:35.307
You know about this
Bioxene growth hormone?

33:35.307 --> 33:37.184
I'm working with Bob on it.

33:37.184 --> 33:39.394
We got a Bioxene growth hormones structure

33:39.394 --> 33:40.896
and we looked for the same thing in Danny.

33:40.896 --> 33:42.814
This is what we got.

33:42.814 --> 33:46.109
- Something very similar.
- Ah.. but different.

33:46.109 --> 33:49.279
So the stuff that Danny took
is not the Bioxene product?

33:49.279 --> 33:51.907
What's in his blood is a highly sialilated

33:51.907 --> 33:55.077
but mutated version of
skeletal muscle growth hormone.

33:55.077 --> 34:00.499
So Danny's cells are producing
the skeletal muscle growth hormone

34:00.499 --> 34:03.085
but not his natural skeletal muscle
growth hormone, right?

34:03.085 --> 34:05.712
- Si.
- Yes.

34:05.712 --> 34:08.090
Son of a bitch.

34:11.009 --> 34:13.178
Has Bioxene been experimenting
with gene therapy?

34:13.178 --> 34:15.304
No, but I obviously somebody else has.

34:15.304 --> 34:17.516
The muscle growth hormone in Danny
had to be concocted in a lab.

34:17.516 --> 34:21.311
Instead of injecting something into him
that shouldn't be there,

34:21.311 --> 34:22.603
he gets his body to make it.

34:22.603 --> 34:25.815
One injection of the DNA
and his body makes the hormone.

34:25.815 --> 34:28.402
So he's not cheating. His body is.

34:28.402 --> 34:31.112
And even though he has
high levels of growth factor

34:31.112 --> 34:34.283
no one can say with certainty
those levels are the result of doping.

34:34.283 --> 34:36.118
Pretty smart huh?

34:37.911 --> 34:43.000
Well, if not Bioxene. Who in the wide world of
sports is experimenting with gene doping?

34:43.000 --> 34:46.587
David, if I can't play. It's my life man.

34:46.587 --> 34:48.297
This is all I know.

34:48.297 --> 34:50.090
One shot one time.

34:50.090 --> 34:51.216
David.

34:51.216 --> 34:52.885
Schuller and Raskin are here.

34:52.885 --> 34:54.803
Conference room.

34:56.013 --> 34:58.015
Good work boys.

34:58.015 --> 35:01.518
We believe Harvey Thomas had access
to 2 batches of Crow & Grow feed.

35:01.518 --> 35:05.689
These batches were sent to 3
out of Wide Valley 60 bird operations.

35:05.689 --> 35:08.692
Any roosters were infected by the prions
in the feed and they in turn

35:08.692 --> 35:11.278
infected the chicken eggs they fertilized.

35:11.278 --> 35:13.280
Which is about 10 to 30 offspring a day.

35:13.280 --> 35:16.909
No one's denying that Harvey Thomas
came up with a very efficient system

35:16.909 --> 35:19.077
to contaminate Wide Valley's product.

35:19.077 --> 35:22.789
NorBAC found human prions
in chickens at 2 of the 3 ops.

35:22.789 --> 35:24.708
And in the interest of 0 risk to the public,

35:24.708 --> 35:27.878
all 3 farms will be depopulated.

35:27.878 --> 35:31.215
That's 6 million birds
at a cost of 24 million dollars.

35:31.215 --> 35:34.092
That's a very significant sacrifice
in the public welfare.

35:34.092 --> 35:35.385
Thank you, congress woman Shuller.

35:35.385 --> 35:38.514
What can we do for those
who are potentially infected?

35:38.514 --> 35:40.182
There's nothing we can do.

35:40.182 --> 35:41.308
There is no cure.

35:41.308 --> 35:44.603
There is one thing.

35:44.603 --> 35:48.398
You could fund Harvey Thomas' research.
Let him pick up where he left off.

35:48.398 --> 35:50.817
He's not just ahead of the curve on this.
He made the curve.

35:50.817 --> 35:52.194
He's a madman.

35:52.194 --> 35:54.279
Who says you have to be sane
to be brilliant?

35:54.279 --> 35:56.782
Is that your honest opinion?

36:00.118 --> 36:04.414
I think that we could find sufficient funds
to support continuing research.

36:04.414 --> 36:07.084
Jesus, that was easy. Harvey should have
come to you guys in the first place.

36:07.084 --> 36:09.795
All right, then uh..
Is there anything else?

36:09.795 --> 36:12.089
Were there shipments
of hens to other farms?

36:12.089 --> 36:13.382
None.

36:13.382 --> 36:15.008
Roosters?

36:15.008 --> 36:17.386
Limited.

36:18.011 --> 36:19.304
Say again?

36:20.389 --> 36:23.809
Some birds may have been shipped
to operations in other states.

36:23.809 --> 36:26.186
And you're not calling those farms?

36:26.186 --> 36:29.189
We're testing roosters, thousands.

36:29.189 --> 36:33.610
And if you find one infected rooster next week
what if his offsprings already been shipped?

36:33.610 --> 36:38.699
Let's not destroy the poultry industry that
employs 500000 americans, Dr. Sandstrom.

36:40.117 --> 36:43.704
Should the public statement
come from us or the FDA?

36:43.704 --> 36:47.291
Surely you understand
the ramifications of going public.

36:47.291 --> 36:51.712
Chickens could be carrying a fucking
death sentence for millions of people.

36:51.712 --> 36:54.089
Let's hold all public remarks
until we have determined

36:54.089 --> 36:56.508
the potential economic damage
to the industry.

36:56.508 --> 36:57.092
What?

36:57.092 --> 36:59.219
And I want to move on that
as soon as possible.

36:59.219 --> 37:02.806
I'm going public with this and
I don't give a shit what you people think.

37:02.806 --> 37:03.807
All right then.

37:03.807 --> 37:07.102
Thank you all.

37:09.897 --> 37:11.315
What a fuckin' bitch.

37:11.315 --> 37:12.107
Which one?

37:12.107 --> 37:13.192
Take your pick.

37:13.192 --> 37:17.279
Well, bitch Shuler is the chair of
the congressional committee that funds us.

37:17.279 --> 37:22.701
She is also in NorBAC trilateral committee
and she hired me.

37:22.701 --> 37:24.786
Well, this is awkward.

37:24.786 --> 37:25.913
You didn't tell me.

37:25.913 --> 37:29.791
Does someone have to be important
for you not swear at them?

37:35.881 --> 37:38.884
Ah.. congress woman Shuller. I was a little
out there just now.

37:38.884 --> 37:40.719
Well, let's just chock it up
to low blood sugar.

37:40.719 --> 37:44.014
What Dr. Sandstrom meant to say is that..

37:44.014 --> 37:46.183
He was speaking for both of us.

37:46.183 --> 37:48.685
Because if we're going to be just
another organization that

37:48.685 --> 37:50.312
you could trot out when you need us,

37:50.312 --> 37:54.399
and otherwise ignore us,
you can have my resignation right now.

37:54.399 --> 37:57.110
Shall we discuss this in Washington
next week?

37:57.110 --> 37:59.404
I think we should.

38:03.700 --> 38:05.911
Nice.

38:10.082 --> 38:14.586
So these Italian biotech. Genoa Quest,
they've shown that by injecting

38:14.586 --> 38:19.508
the gene for skeletal MGH they can
increase muscle mass in a mouse by 25%.

38:19.508 --> 38:21.885
So we're thinking there's somebdy in the company
might pick a few euros on the side.

38:21.885 --> 38:23.887
Do a little on the black market, eh?

38:23.887 --> 38:27.015
You think this might be in more
than just a couple of hockey players?

38:27.015 --> 38:30.811
- Will you take a pill that will make you better?
- Just shoot the ball, Bob.

38:30.811 --> 38:34.606
Okay.

38:34.606 --> 38:36.108
Better at what?

38:36.108 --> 38:38.986
At anything.

38:38.986 --> 38:43.490
I like myself just the way I am. Thanks.

38:43.490 --> 38:46.994
You wouldn't take a pill that will,
I don't know... Makes you smarter?

38:46.994 --> 38:48.620
Well, I'd do that.

38:48.620 --> 38:49.705
I'd take a handful.

38:49.705 --> 38:52.291
Bob, you've already got a IQ of 162.

38:52.291 --> 38:55.210
But wouldn't you like to see what's beyond? I
mean, that's what it's all about, isn't it?

38:55.210 --> 38:56.795
Opening new doors.

38:56.795 --> 38:58.005
New game.

38:58.589 --> 39:00.591
Bob, not if that pill is going to kill you.

39:00.591 --> 39:03.802
Say, you are blind. Would you take a pill
for 10 years of sight?

39:03.802 --> 39:05.721
Let's face it.

39:05.721 --> 39:07.306
We're taking pills these days
for everything.

39:07.306 --> 39:11.101
Make themselves happy, waking up,
going to sleep, makin' your dicks harder,

39:11.101 --> 39:13.395
growin' your hair,
blood pressure, pimples.

39:13.395 --> 39:16.106
It's a drug happy brave new world
we're livin' in.

39:16.106 --> 39:18.400
Are you gonna shoot
the fuckin' ball or what?

39:18.400 --> 39:19.109
Okay.

39:30.287 --> 39:32.998
Go back to work.

39:32.998 --> 39:36.418
I need blood samples and the growth hormone
from both Genoa Quest and Bioxene.

39:36.418 --> 39:40.214
Let' put them apart, find out
what makes them different.

39:40.214 --> 39:42.883
So, Bioxene, Genoa Quest.
They're nearly identical.

39:42.883 --> 39:44.718
- Like the amino-acids.
- Yeah.

39:44.718 --> 39:46.386
Real alike, but different.

39:46.386 --> 39:47.221
Look here.

39:47.221 --> 39:51.600
The Genoa Quest hormone is missing
a few residues from the end terminus.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.310
Why are they different? Where's Carlos?

39:53.310 --> 39:54.186
Carlos!

39:54.186 --> 39:57.314
We do have an intercom here, you know.

39:57.314 --> 39:59.900
What do they gain by the difference?

39:59.900 --> 40:01.109
What were they trying to do?

40:01.818 --> 40:04.112
Hey check this out.

40:04.112 --> 40:08.408
The end terminus of the
Genoa Quest growth hormone is missing.

40:09.910 --> 40:11.995
- A few residues are deleted.
- Yeah.

40:11.995 --> 40:14.998
But why. I mean, what were they gaining?

40:17.209 --> 40:19.086
They're not gaining.

40:19.086 --> 40:22.297
So they deleted it because...

40:22.297 --> 40:25.384
Because they needed it to be different.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.806
I though I might find you here.

40:30.806 --> 40:32.516
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

40:32.516 --> 40:35.102
So what information?

40:35.102 --> 40:38.605
Well, the hormone you took is actually
an Italian gene therapy.

40:38.605 --> 40:41.400
They based it on an American one, but
in order to duck a patent infringement

40:41.400 --> 40:44.486
they put a little spin on it.
And that change did inadvertantly cause

40:44.486 --> 40:46.196
the hormone to act on the heart muscle.

40:46.196 --> 40:47.990
That's what causes it to explode.

40:47.990 --> 40:52.286
So Biriliski and Archembault died
to avoid a patent infringement.

40:52.286 --> 40:53.620
Fuck.

40:53.620 --> 40:57.207
And because the Italian compound
hadn't been put into human trials,

40:57.207 --> 40:59.293
they didn't detect the side effect.

40:59.293 --> 41:05.215
But I think I might be able
to reverse the gene therapy in you.

41:05.215 --> 41:07.301
What if I don't want it to stop?

41:07.301 --> 41:11.597
Danny, your... your body is producing
growth hormone 24/7.

41:11.597 --> 41:14.892
I mean every day
your muscle mass increases.

41:14.892 --> 41:16.894
Look you, you don't know
what's gonna happen to me, David.

41:16.894 --> 41:19.313
Well, we know that shit
eventually lands on a heart muscle.

41:19.313 --> 41:22.900
And Biriliski and Archanbald are
any indication.

41:22.900 --> 41:25.694
Well, what are you saying?

41:27.112 --> 41:30.282
I'm saying, no more hockey, Danny.
I'm sorry.

41:30.282 --> 41:32.409
I'll take my chances.

41:32.409 --> 41:33.118
What?

41:33.118 --> 41:35.204
I'll take my chance..
I got a week to prove myself.

41:35.204 --> 41:36.622
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

41:36.622 --> 41:40.209
I'm 35, David. 35. No more chances...

41:40.209 --> 41:43.587
You don't understand. You can't do it
anymore. You will die.

41:43.587 --> 41:47.216
Fuck you David. You're a bigshot scientist.
I'm nobody. I make piss all.

41:47.216 --> 41:50.719
I play at shit old towns,
I got a fuckin' Bulgarian defence man

41:50.719 --> 41:52.804
who can't speak english for a roommate,

41:52.804 --> 41:56.517
my kid doesn't talk to me,
my marriage is bust.

41:56.517 --> 42:01.522
- You didn't answer my question.
- Yes, I did.

42:13.408 --> 42:15.994
- I thought you left.
- Did.

42:15.994 --> 42:16.912
Came back.

42:16.912 --> 42:19.122
What's up?

42:19.122 --> 42:22.292
Want a drink?

42:23.001 --> 42:25.921
Okay.

42:26.797 --> 42:28.090
What are you working on?

42:28.090 --> 42:29.591
Bob had a theory.

42:29.591 --> 42:32.010
Good one. Died fast.

42:32.010 --> 42:35.889
What case?

42:35.889 --> 42:37.516
Friend of mine.

42:37.516 --> 42:41.186
Hockey player. Fooling around
with synthetic growth hormones.

42:42.396 --> 42:44.398
Is he a good friend of yours?

42:46.316 --> 42:48.819
His name's Danny.

42:48.819 --> 42:51.321
His family busted up
when we were in high school.

42:51.321 --> 42:55.701
Practically lived in our basement
for 2 years.

42:55.701 --> 42:56.910
Taught me a lot.

42:56.910 --> 42:58.495
Like what?

42:58.495 --> 43:04.209
Drinkin', women, drugs, sports.

43:04.209 --> 43:08.589
Friendship.

43:08.589 --> 43:12.092
To friendship.

43:12.092 --> 43:17.389
To friendship.

43:26.023 --> 43:27.983
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:27.983 --> 43:30.194
Something smells good. Whatcha making?

43:30.194 --> 43:32.196
- Chicken.
- God.

43:32.196 --> 43:35.199
What? What?! Dad! Wow!

43:35.199 --> 43:37.409
- What, what, what were...
- Sorry.

43:37.409 --> 43:40.996
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

43:44.082 --> 43:47.711
Hey, Dav. Danny, listen, I'm on a plane
back to Desmoines tonight.

43:47.711 --> 43:49.421
- Fuck. I got cut.
- Oh shit.

43:49.421 --> 43:51.423
So uh.. So I'll see ya.

43:51.423 --> 43:53.300
What bad news?

43:53.300 --> 43:55.385
It's not good.

43:58.388 --> 44:01.099
Come on, Danny.

44:17.282 --> 44:18.200
Yeah?

44:18.200 --> 44:19.409
Hey man, how you doing?

44:19.409 --> 44:21.119
Good. Good.

44:21.119 --> 44:23.205
I got your message. What happened?

44:23.205 --> 44:25.123
I don't know.

44:25.123 --> 44:28.210
I thought it was fine. I felt great.
My agent thinks it's a wank.

44:28.210 --> 44:32.923
Their were negotiating with somebody else.
They brought me up to put pressure on 'em.

44:32.923 --> 44:34.800
Guess it worked.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.218
Look, you want me to come over?

44:36.218 --> 44:38.303
Better yet, why don't you come over here.
We'll uh.. make you some dinner..

44:38.303 --> 44:39.388
No no no.

44:39.388 --> 44:42.891
Listen, it was great seeing you again.
I really appreciate everything.

44:42.891 --> 44:47.312
- My cab's here. I gotta go.
- Sure you okay?

44:47.312 --> 44:50.107
Yeah. You know. Life's a rollercoaster.

44:50.107 --> 44:51.984
Call me tomorrow, all right?

44:51.984 --> 44:54.194
Great seeing you again.
I appreciate everything.

44:54.194 --> 44:56.697
Yeah, you too.

45:00.617 --> 45:01.785
How is he?

45:01.785 --> 45:05.706
Ah.. He's gonna be okay.
He's a tough guy.

46:10.187 --> 46:12.022
- What's she doing here?
- You hired her.

46:12.022 --> 46:14.024
- I did?
- I'm confused.

46:14.024 --> 46:15.901
Hello David.

46:15.901 --> 46:17.194
I'm going out for a while.

46:17.194 --> 46:17.903
Where are you going?

46:17.903 --> 46:19.696
Out.

46:19.696 --> 46:20.489
For a while.

46:20.489 --> 46:21.990
I don't know what they'll say
if they found out.

46:21.990 --> 46:25.911
Let's make sure they don't find out.

46:25.911 --> 46:30.290
I've been asked to mediate in the dispute between
two researchers in a clinical trial. David!

46:30.290 --> 46:32.000
I don't do bureaucratic bullshit.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.002
He was diagnosed with leukemia a year ago.

46:34.002 --> 46:36.213
You got any proof that
the therapy caused the stroke?

46:36.213 --> 46:39.007
I think, that the Peterson boy's
immune system overresponded.

46:39.007 --> 46:40.300
But you don't know.

46:40.300 --> 46:41.593
Neither does Booker.

46:41.593 --> 46:43.595
The boy was sick.

46:43.595 --> 46:45.722
Died of a disease that we were trying
to save him from.

46:45.722 --> 46:48.892
You studied the therapy.
Does it work or doesn't it work?

46:48.892 --> 46:52.020
It's the one death that you're gonna
have to deal with.

46:52.020 --> 46:53.397
I found it.

46:53.397 --> 46:55.399
That's very nice cooler, David.

46:55.399 --> 46:58.402
It's the sample of the 1918 flu.

47:01.488 --> 47:05.617
This here is your
Mr. George Edward Plane.

47:05.617 --> 47:09.413
Oh, your fuckin' beautiful.
