01:05.230 --> 01:07.165
D'oh!

01:24.684 --> 01:27.016
This watermelon
won't know what hit it.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.714
I love our Tuesdays together, Dad.

01:35.728 --> 01:38.060
Don't you two have
a list of chores to do?

01:38.164 --> 01:41.565
Hey, we just took care of that dangerous
melon that was threatening our garden.

01:41.668 --> 01:44.637
Yeah. We're heroes.
But where's our parade?

01:46.206 --> 01:48.470
All right.
"Open stuck drawer."

01:48.575 --> 01:52.238
All righty.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.245
- It's hopeless.
- Or is it?

01:54.347 --> 01:58.044
- Yeah, it's hopeless.
- I said, "Or is it?"

01:58.151 --> 02:01.279
I said, "It-" Oh.

02:01.387 --> 02:05.050
Homer, what are you doing?

02:05.158 --> 02:08.184
Listen, do you want the job done right
or do you want it done fast?

02:08.294 --> 02:10.854
Well, like all Americans, fast. But-

02:10.964 --> 02:13.091
Clear!

02:16.236 --> 02:18.602
Hmm. Well, you can't argue with results.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.174
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

02:26.546 --> 02:30.846
Oh, don't worry. You'll be sleeping
in this beautiful new doghouse.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.248
January 2007.

02:38.258 --> 02:43.753
And now, the grand finale.
"Get Lisa's jammed tape out of VCR."

02:43.863 --> 02:47.492
Whoops. Wait a minute.
There.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.501
Fire in the hole!

02:50.603 --> 02:52.537
Hmm.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.164
It's gonna take a lot of fireworks
to clean this place up.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.334
What's going on here?

02:57.443 --> 03:01.846
Uh, honey, there's a point
in every father's life...

03:01.948 --> 03:03.882
when he blows up
his daughter's room.

03:03.983 --> 03:07.749
Oh, yeah? You didn't blow up Maggie's room.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.789
Oh, Lisa. This must be
a rough time for you.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.290
Do you have any friends or family
you can stay with?

03:13.393 --> 03:15.384
You've ruined all my stuff.

03:15.495 --> 03:20.057
Oh, come on. Tell us how we can make it up to you.
Hey, pretend it's your birthday!

03:20.166 --> 03:23.567
- It is my birthday!
- That's the spirit. Now what do you want to do?

03:23.670 --> 03:25.604
Well, the book festival
starts today-

03:25.705 --> 03:29.334
Anything at all. You name it.
What do you want to do?

03:29.442 --> 03:31.706
Stupid Lisa.

03:34.414 --> 03:39.283
Hear ye! Hear ye!
One dollar off on all poetry books!

03:39.385 --> 03:42.047
All right!

03:42.155 --> 03:44.123
Their hands were everywhere.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.522
<i>Hello, Simpsons.</i>

03:46.626 --> 03:48.787
Care to try a sample
from my new cookbook-

03:48.895 --> 03:51.056
<i>Someone's in the Kitchen with Jesus.</i>

03:52.799 --> 03:56.291
Mmm! These stigmuffins
are to die for.

03:56.402 --> 04:00.270
Oh, if you like that, you should try
Mary Magdalene's Chocolate Orgasm.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.637
Ooh, okay.

04:02.742 --> 04:06.200
Mmm!

04:06.312 --> 04:11.579
So, Mr. King, what tale of horror
and the macabre are you working on now?

04:11.684 --> 04:13.675
Oh, I don't feel like
writing horror right now.

04:13.786 --> 04:15.413
Oh, that's too bad.

04:15.521 --> 04:19.252
I'm working on a biography of
Benjamin Franklin. He's a fascinating man.

04:19.358 --> 04:23.921
He discovered electricity and used it to torture
small animals and green mountain men.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.931
And that key he tied
to the end of a kite?

04:27.033 --> 04:30.298
It opened the gates of hell!

04:30.403 --> 04:32.963
Well, let me know when you
get back to horror.

04:33.072 --> 04:34.903
Will do.

04:36.809 --> 04:40.245
Hey, with my Info Cram 6000...

04:40.346 --> 04:44.908
you can absorb books instantly by attaching
this electrode to the brainpan...

04:45.018 --> 04:48.249
and this one to the... loins!

04:48.354 --> 04:51.846
Tolstoy... searing... brain-

04:51.958 --> 04:55.724
With my diet, you can eat all you want
anytime you want.

04:55.828 --> 04:59.423
- And you lose weight?
- Uh, you might. It's a free country.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.869
Finally, books for today's busy idiot.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.872
<i>Network Programming</i>
<i>for Dummies.</i>

05:07.974 --> 05:10.807
<i>Christianity for Dummies.</i>
<i>Mo- Moby Dick?</i>

05:10.910 --> 05:13.105
"Call me Ishmael, dummy."

05:13.212 --> 05:14.611
How did you write
all these books?

05:14.714 --> 05:15.681
Duh, I don't know.
Me gotta go to bank now.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.982
Look, Maggie, Christopher Walken's
reading <i>Goodnight Moon.</i>

05:24.090 --> 05:27.617
"Good night, room.
Good night, moon.

05:27.727 --> 05:30.560
Good night, cow
jumping over the moon."

05:32.632 --> 05:37.899
Please, children, scooch closer. Don't make
me tell you again about the scooching.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.599
You in the red, chop-chop. Hmm.

05:45.044 --> 05:48.013
Eh.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.674
All right, does anyone have
a question for our panel...

05:50.783 --> 05:53.911
- that's not about how much money they make?
- Uh, yeah.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.250
I'm a techno-thriller junkie,
and I'd like to know...

05:56.356 --> 05:58.984
is the B-2 bomber more
detectable when it rains?

05:59.092 --> 06:01.686
- Oh. What do you think, Tom Clancy?
- Well, the B-2-

06:01.794 --> 06:03.591
No, no, no.
I was asking Maya Angelou.

06:03.696 --> 06:09.032
The ebony fighter awakens
dappled with the dewy beads of morn.

06:09.135 --> 06:12.502
- Maya Angelou is black?
- It is a Mach-five child...

06:12.605 --> 06:16.507
forever bound to suckle from
the shriveled breast of Congress.

06:16.609 --> 06:21.205
Oh, Maya,
you're a national treasure.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.544
Ms. Tan,
I loved <i>TheJoy Luck Club.</i>

06:23.649 --> 06:26.982
It really showed me how the mother-daughter
bond can triumph over adversity.

06:27.086 --> 06:30.544
No. That's not what I meant at all.
You couldn't have gotten it more wrong.

06:30.656 --> 06:34.057
- But-
- Please, just sit down.
I'm embarrassed for both of us.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.254
Mmm.

06:37.363 --> 06:40.423
Ew.

06:44.504 --> 06:47.701
Book writing, what a scam, huh?

06:47.807 --> 06:52.210
It's only 20 pages long, and this guy
wrote it for me. What's your name again?

06:52.311 --> 06:55.644
- John Updike.
- Whoa, whoa. I didn't ask for your life story.

06:55.748 --> 06:59.343
So you really know Krusty?
What's he like?

06:59.452 --> 07:02.944
Oh, he's wonderful.
He would do anything for his fans.

07:03.055 --> 07:05.216
<i>Hurry up, kid.</i>

07:05.324 --> 07:09.317
- Name?
- Hey, it's me, Bart.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.227
- Your biggest fan.
- Hey, good for you, 'cause I wanna...

07:12.331 --> 07:15.198
uh, know that all my fans
are, you know-

07:15.301 --> 07:17.792
"K the C"?

07:17.904 --> 07:20.031
Hey, this pen's gotta last me all day!

07:20.139 --> 07:22.869
Now if you could
bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, yeah.

07:22.975 --> 07:25.034
- Name?
- My name is Sophie.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.510
- Hey, good luck with that.
- I'm your daughter.

07:27.613 --> 07:31.208
- What?
- I finally found my daddy.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.548
Ohh! I think I just
"seltzered" myself.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.713
Shut up, Updike!

07:39.992 --> 07:43.484
Listen, honey, a lot of kids
think of me as their daddy.

07:43.596 --> 07:47.623
But I'm just a simple TV legend.
Here, have a key chain.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.792
No. I'm sure you're my father.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.802
You met my mom
during the Gulf War.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.998
- Ohh. Was your mother an Israeli flight attendant?
- No.

07:55.107 --> 07:57.837
- Cokie Roberts?
- No, she was a soldier.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.778
Chestnut brown hair, kind of shy,
32 confirmed kills-

08:01.881 --> 08:07.114
Oh! Oh, boy.
Now it's coming back to me.

08:09.622 --> 08:13.854
Saddam Hussein?
They should call him "So-Damn-Insane!"

08:13.960 --> 08:17.191
Hey! You're just fanning
the flames of hatred!

08:17.296 --> 08:19.196
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:19.298 --> 08:22.358
Now just when you thought
the desert couldn't get any hotter...

08:22.468 --> 08:26.165
it's the Cincinnati
Bengals cheerleaders!

08:26.272 --> 08:28.832
Hey, I can't look at that!
I have a girlfriend back home!

08:28.941 --> 08:31.136
This is an insult to our Muslim hosts!

08:31.244 --> 08:35.236
<i>During the show, a desert wind kicked up.</i>

08:38.217 --> 08:41.118
<i>I sought shelter in a nearby tent.</i>

08:41.220 --> 08:43.552
Huh? Ohh.

08:43.655 --> 08:47.353
<i>There was your mother</i>
<i>looking like a beautiful mirage.</i>

08:47.460 --> 08:50.327
<i>Maybe it was the anthrax in the air.</i>

08:50.429 --> 08:52.727
<i>Maybe it was the fact</i>
<i>the Arab women weren't bitin'.</i>

08:52.832 --> 08:56.734
<i>Whatever it was, it was magic.</i>

09:01.140 --> 09:04.371
<i>We slept late into the morning.</i>
<i>And then-</i>

09:04.477 --> 09:07.105
My God!
I'm late for my mission!

09:07.213 --> 09:09.807
Here's your mission.
Get down with the clown.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.850
- Oh, come on, baby.
- No, not now!

09:11.951 --> 09:14.215
- I'm supposed to assassinate Saddam!
- <i>Wait a minute!</i>

09:14.320 --> 09:17.380
You can't kill Saddam!
He's half my act!

09:25.798 --> 09:29.165
- <i>No, stop!</i>
- No!

09:35.875 --> 09:38.002
No!

09:38.110 --> 09:40.840
I just saved my baseball bit.

09:40.947 --> 09:46.647
"Who-say-in's on first,
lya-toll-ya's on second and-" Aah!

09:46.752 --> 09:48.777
Stupid clown!

09:48.888 --> 09:53.086
When I came to, she was gone,
and the war had been over for eight months.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.183
Anyway, how'd you finally find me?

09:55.294 --> 09:57.990
All Mom ever said was my father
was some pathetic clown.

09:58.097 --> 10:01.931
So I typed "pathetic clown" into a search engine
and your name popped right up.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.002
<i>It's Mom!</i>

10:04.103 --> 10:06.936
Hey, how you been?
Remember me?

10:07.039 --> 10:10.406
You better get going.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.443
It was nice meeting you.
Thanks for coming out.

10:12.545 --> 10:18.245
But I was hoping maybe we could do some
stuff together, like go to the beach and junk.

10:18.351 --> 10:22.583
Look, you're a sweet kid.
But I'm not exactly father material.

10:22.688 --> 10:27.182
I curse, I gamble,
I pick fights with homeless people, l-

10:27.293 --> 10:30.228
What's wrong with your eyes?
You need a Claritin or something?

10:31.330 --> 10:33.355
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

10:33.466 --> 10:37.095
- You get one trip to the beach... with my assistant.
- Mmm.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.899
- Okay, I'll take you.
- Yea!

10:40.973 --> 10:43.533
Dear Lord,
bless this humble meal.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.510
And did you hear about Krusty?
Whoo, man!

10:46.612 --> 10:49.775
I mean, I knew he was a player,
but geez, a kid?

10:49.882 --> 10:51.907
Homer, that's not a prayer.
That's gossip.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.782
Fine. I'll just discuss
heavenly matters.

10:54.887 --> 10:57.913
So how's Maude Flanders doing up there?
She playin' the field?

10:58.024 --> 11:01.187
Ooh! Yeah, really?
All those guys?

11:02.261 --> 11:03.853
Amen.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.475
Okay, kid, there's the water.
Knock yourself out.

11:18.577 --> 11:21.705
Come on, Dad.
Let's go bodysurfing or boogie boarding.

11:21.814 --> 11:25.250
Listen, kid, I'm not the kind of dad
who, you know, does things...

11:25.351 --> 11:29.412
or says stuff, or looks at you,
but the love is there.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.456
Where are you?
Give Daddy a clue.

11:31.557 --> 11:34.424
Aw, that's my girl.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.088
Okay, you just sit there
and I'll throw the Frisbee to you.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.995
Ohh! I gotta sit up now?

11:41.100 --> 11:44.501
Ohh! What am I,
Baryshnikov? Ohh!

11:44.603 --> 11:49.802
Hey, you beat me!
What a great day we've had, huh?

11:49.909 --> 11:53.777
You know, for a clown,
you're not really a lot of fun.

11:53.879 --> 11:57.007
Ohh.

11:57.116 --> 12:01.780
Boy, fatherhood is one tough gig.
I don't get how other guys do it.

12:02.822 --> 12:04.915
Ready, switch!

12:06.926 --> 12:10.453
Hey, uh, careful, boys.
That arch is looking a little Romanesque.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.531
Sorry, Daddy.
How should I punish myself?

12:14.100 --> 12:18.127
No, Son. You let 'em finish, then you smash it.
That's a good boy.

12:18.237 --> 12:21.536
- Mush, Homer! Mush!
- Catch, Dad! Catch!

12:21.640 --> 12:24.370
Okay, that stings
daddy's eyes, honey.

12:24.477 --> 12:28.004
Hmm. I think I found my mentor.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.014
Heads up!

12:30.116 --> 12:33.210
You know, Homer,
I've spent my whole life entertaining kids.

12:33.319 --> 12:36.550
But I just realized I don't know
the first thing about 'em.

12:36.655 --> 12:40.284
Well, I won't lie. Fatherhood isn't easy-
like motherhood-

12:40.392 --> 12:42.917
but I wouldn't trade it for anything.

12:43.028 --> 12:46.862
Except for some mag wheels.
Oh, man. That would be sweet.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.866
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

12:48.968 --> 12:52.199
Just a second, honey!
Daddy's on his high horse!

12:52.304 --> 12:57.640
- Dad!
- Yeah, I'm watching, honey! Nice cannonball!

12:57.743 --> 13:03.545
Anyhoo, the key to fathering is don't overthink,
because overthinking is, um-

13:03.649 --> 13:07.050
What were we talking about?
Ooh, a clown!

13:07.153 --> 13:09.553
<i># Well, I like that girl #</i>

13:09.655 --> 13:11.850
<i># She's the cutest</i>
<i>little thing I know #</i>

13:11.957 --> 13:14.357
<i># Plus, she likes me back #</i>

13:14.460 --> 13:17.918
<i># And all mine</i>
<i>from head to toe #</i>

13:18.030 --> 13:21.295
<i># Yeah, she never makes me</i>
<i>wonder when it comes to that #</i>

13:21.400 --> 13:25.359
<i># Well, my head's in a whirl</i>
<i>because I like that girl #</i>

13:26.539 --> 13:28.939
<i># At a beauty contest #</i>

13:29.041 --> 13:32.909
<i># She's the kindjust couldn't lose</i>
<i>She ain't lost one yet ##</i>

13:35.014 --> 13:36.982
Kid, I gotta admit.

13:37.082 --> 13:38.982
You're starting to grow on me.

13:39.084 --> 13:42.542
Same here, Dad. It's nice that
you don't always have to be on.

13:42.655 --> 13:47.058
I thought I was on! When was I off?
That bit about the tide pool?

13:47.159 --> 13:49.992
I tell ya, it killed at
Jacques Cousteau's funeral.

13:50.095 --> 13:53.258
Dad, relax.
Just enjoy the sunset.

13:56.101 --> 14:00.629
Hey, I know that song.
My dad used to play that when I was a boy.

14:00.739 --> 14:04.732
- It's beautiful.
- Do you play?

14:04.844 --> 14:08.473
No. I guess musical talent
skips a generation, like diabetes.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.548
You might want to
watch out for that too.

14:16.288 --> 14:18.256
<i>Mom, I had the best time.</i>
<i>Can Dad come in for milk and cookies?</i>

14:18.357 --> 14:20.325
Why I'd love to-
Ohh!

14:21.827 --> 14:23.761
<i>Oskar Homolka!</i>

14:23.863 --> 14:25.763
That's okay.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.733
I think I'll go somewhere friendlier,
like beautiful downtown Grozny.

14:29.835 --> 14:32.497
Zoom!

14:33.906 --> 14:36.204
My little girl's sharp as a tack.

14:36.308 --> 14:40.404
I tried the "got your nose" bit on her,
didn't fool her for a second.

14:40.512 --> 14:43.310
My uncle still has my nose.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.576
Hmm? Ohh, ohh, ohh!

14:47.686 --> 14:51.452
Oh, what a- ha, ha-
lousy hand. I'll stand.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.286
I raise two G's.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.292
- I'm out.
- Fold-o-rama.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.521
- Can we make this hand high-low?
- No.

14:57.630 --> 15:01.225
- I fold.
- Krusty, are you in or are you out?

15:01.333 --> 15:04.894
Oh, man. I'm totally tapped.
Would you consider taking my Rolex?

15:05.004 --> 15:09.566
- You mean this one?
- Oh, yeah. Right. Just let me go to my car.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.473
#A weema-way
A weema-way #

15:14.580 --> 15:17.708
- #A weema-way A weema-way, A weem-#
- Don't do that.

15:17.816 --> 15:21.252
Hmm? Let's see, a sweater...

15:21.353 --> 15:25.551
a custom floor mat-
the stereo!

15:25.658 --> 15:28.456
Theft alert. Deploy air bag.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.120
Yaah!

15:31.230 --> 15:34.097
Best hand of my life
and I can't even-

15:34.199 --> 15:38.431
<i>Huh? Sophie's violin.</i>
<i>Oh, no, I couldn't!</i>

15:38.537 --> 15:42.633
# Do it, do it do it, do it #

15:42.741 --> 15:47.303
- # She'll never know ##
- Ahh!

15:47.413 --> 15:50.940
Hmm.

15:53.052 --> 15:58.183
Well, it won't bring much cash, but
its sentimental value's through the roof.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.190
It is acceptable.

16:00.292 --> 16:04.251
Then I'm in and I call!
Four aces!

16:04.363 --> 16:07.389
- Read 'em and-
- Straight flush!

16:09.468 --> 16:14.428
Oh, no! Oh, no! You can't!
My daughter will never forgive me!

16:18.477 --> 16:21.776
Oh, wait.
Now I can do it for real.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.066
Hey.

16:42.768 --> 16:46.465
Hey, hey, Dad!

16:46.572 --> 16:50.668
Hey, hey! Now look, Sophie,
I know you think your daddy's perfect.

16:50.776 --> 16:55.304
- No, I don't.
- But I did a bad thing.
I lost your violin in a poker game.

16:55.414 --> 16:59.248
- You what?
- But don't worry! I got you an even better one!

16:59.351 --> 17:04.253
- This is a ukulele.
- Yeah, the thinking man's violin. Check it out.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.883
# I want to go back to my little grass shack
in Kealakekua, Hawaii #

17:07.992 --> 17:11.622
- I want my violin.
- But honey, l-

17:11.730 --> 17:15.757
I can't believe you would gamble with
something that meant so much to me.

17:15.867 --> 17:20.896
Wait! Time out!
Four aces is not a gamble.

17:21.006 --> 17:24.874
Mom was right.
I was better off not knowing you.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.381
Word on the street
is you dumped Dawson.

17:31.483 --> 17:35.419
He's history, Jenda. Wait till he sees me
with that new exchange student.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.046
<i>Hola, Harmony.</i>
<i>¿Que es el dilly-yo?</i>

17:38.157 --> 17:41.058
I'm all for ethnic diversity,
but this is just pandering.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.687
Maybe so. But Dawson's
gonna be bummed.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.561
You gotta help me!
My daughter found out I'm a jerk!

17:47.666 --> 17:51.329
Oh, Krusty. I'm sure she just
needs time to get used to you.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.873
- Marge, may I play devil's advocate for a moment?
- Sure, go ahead.

17:54.973 --> 17:57.533
<i>Come on! Get- Get in there!</i>

17:57.643 --> 18:00.407
D'oh! Stupid game!

18:00.512 --> 18:04.107
- Now what were we talking about?
- My daughter's violin!

18:04.216 --> 18:07.777
Oh, right. Why don't we just break into
Fat Tony's compound and get it back?

18:07.886 --> 18:10.878
Really? You'd help me
take on the mob?

18:10.989 --> 18:14.584
For a casual acquaintance
like you? Absolutely.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.669
It's some kind of Mafia summit!

18:29.775 --> 18:32.437
Every mob family
in the country's here.

18:32.544 --> 18:36.981
The Cuomos, the Travoltas,
the Lasordas, the Boyardees.

18:37.082 --> 18:40.677
This is perfect.
If I know Fat Tony, which I don't...

18:40.786 --> 18:42.913
he'll be distracted
by his hosting duties.

18:43.021 --> 18:44.989
Come on!

18:47.926 --> 18:50.656
Idiots.

18:54.967 --> 18:59.666
Hey, I heard there's a lunar eclipse tonight.
Maybe we should look up.

18:59.771 --> 19:02.171
Nah. For me it's solar or nothin'.

19:06.879 --> 19:12.374
Welcome to my home. To answer
your first question, yes, we do have pasta.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.782
Hey, all right. I love pasta.
That's good.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.412
If you need money laundered,
just set it outside your door.

19:17.523 --> 19:20.253
- You can pick it up in the morning.
- Oh, hey!

19:20.359 --> 19:23.522
- Beautiful.
- Now some unpleasant news.

19:23.629 --> 19:27.827
I have learned that
someone in this room is a squealer.

19:27.933 --> 19:32.370
We've narrowed it down to either
Johnny Tightlips or Frankie the Squealer.

19:32.471 --> 19:36.805
Okay, it's me! I can't help it!
I just like squealin'! It makes me feel big!

19:36.909 --> 19:39.275
All right, come on.
You're history.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.677
The violin's gotta be
around here somewhere.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.810
Had enough, Squealer?

19:48.921 --> 19:50.946
Did you know Fat Tony's
real name is Marion?

19:51.056 --> 19:54.025
You just don't get it, do ya?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.327
<i>Bingo!</i>

20:02.568 --> 20:04.331
- D'oh!
- D'oh!

20:04.436 --> 20:07.064
Oh, it's gonna take forever
to go through all of these.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.367
I have a plan.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.709
Well, that didn't work.

20:12.811 --> 20:15.143
- <i>Hey, Legs. Let's gojump on Tony's bed.</i>
- <i>Sure.</i>

20:15.247 --> 20:18.216
- Uh-oh!
- We gotta get outta here. Just take 'em all!

20:18.317 --> 20:21.809
Then it's decided.
Our Web site name will be crime. Org.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.582
I think we're in the clear.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.691
Homer, I got it!

20:36.802 --> 20:39.202
- Johnny Tightlips, where'd they hit you?
- I ain't sayin' nothin'.

20:39.304 --> 20:42.000
- But what do I tell the doctor?
- Tell him to suck a lemon.

20:47.779 --> 20:50.839
Hey.

20:52.451 --> 20:55.215
You did it!
You got it back!

20:55.320 --> 20:57.185
Thanks, Dad.

20:57.289 --> 21:01.885
Dad. That still sounds weird to me.
But I'm glad we're friends again.

21:01.994 --> 21:06.294
- And you've lined the case with money.
- Huh?

21:06.398 --> 21:08.923
Small bills, unmarked
and nonsequential.

21:09.034 --> 21:12.401
Holy samolians!
There must be five grand in there!

21:12.504 --> 21:15.598
Oh, which I intentionally
put in there for you.

21:15.707 --> 21:19.939
Hey, you lucky little
Hamantaschen, you.

21:20.045 --> 21:23.572
Come on. How about a tune
for the old man?

21:27.352 --> 21:29.877
That's him! That's the one!
Homer Simpson!

21:29.988 --> 21:32.354
I said I was sorry.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.618
- All right. Fair enough.
- Class act.

21:34.726 --> 21:37.126
Sorry you're such jerks!
Ha, ha!

21:39.731 --> 21:41.631
<i>Ow!</i>

21:41.733 --> 21:45.066
<i>Ow! That bullet went in!</i>

21:45.170 --> 21:47.695
<i># Just like Cinderella #</i>

21:47.806 --> 21:50.673
<i># The prince solved the mystery #</i>

21:50.776 --> 21:52.937
<i># Well, I conducted</i>
<i>the test myself#</i>

21:53.045 --> 21:55.809
<i># And that slip looks just</i>
<i>the right size for me #</i>

21:55.914 --> 21:58.348
<i># Well, I like that girl #</i>

21:58.450 --> 22:00.475
<i># She's the cutest little thing I know #</i>

22:00.585 --> 22:02.712
<i># Plus, she likes me back #</i>

22:04.122 --> 22:06.716
<i># And all mine</i>
<i>from head to toe #</i>

22:06.825 --> 22:09.453
<i># Yeah, she never makes me</i>
<i>wonder when it comes to that #</i>

22:09.561 --> 22:13.657
<i># Well, my head's in a whirl</i>
<i>because I like that girl #</i>

22:25.077 --> 22:26.977
<i>Shh.</i>

22:27.079 --> 22:29.479
<i>Shut up, Updike!</i>
