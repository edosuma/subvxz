WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:01.896
PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'ITLE LIARS...

00:03.430 --> 00:05.125
Spencer:
THERE'S SOMEONE ALI
IS SO AFRAID OF

00:05.170 --> 00:06.296
SHE CAN'T COME BACK.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.432
IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S
BEST INTERESTS

00:07.470 --> 00:10.462
THAT WE JUST STAY UNTANGLED
FROM THE DiLAURENTIS FAMILY.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.104
I'M GOING TO WORK
FOR MRS. DiLAURENTIS.

00:13.140 --> 00:14.630
TAKE ME WITH YOU.
I CAN'T.

00:14.680 --> 00:15.476
IS THIS ABOUT MIRANDA?

00:15.510 --> 00:17.501
THE GIRL I TOLD YOU
TO LOOK AFTER?

00:19.680 --> 00:20.772
NO.

00:22.050 --> 00:25.611
RADLEY SANITARIUM
HAS TO ADMIT MY MOM
WASN'T A SUICIDE.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.414
TOBY DOESN'T WANT YOUR HELP.
OH, I THINK HE DOES.

00:28.460 --> 00:30.325
I PUT THAT ENVELOPE
IN YOUR LOCKER.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.123
I KNOW YOUR MOM'S INNOCENT.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.651
WE COULD HAVE THIS PLACE.
IT COULD BE OUR SECRET.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.458
IT WAS ALI'S.
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

00:38.500 --> 00:40.491
I TOOK IT FROM THE LAIR
IN RAVENSWOOD.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.269
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW THIS
TO US BEFORE?

00:42.310 --> 00:43.436
BECAUSE OF WHAT'S IN IT.

00:47.410 --> 00:49.139
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:49.180 --> 00:51.171
I-I DON'T RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THESE NAMES.

00:51.210 --> 00:52.472
BECAUSE
SHE CHANGED THEM.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.817
SHE WAS CHANGING STORIES,
TOO.

00:53.850 --> 00:55.477
YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW
THE REAL STORIES

00:55.520 --> 00:57.215
IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE
THE FAKE ONES.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.150
SOUNDS LIKE ALI.
THE TRUTH BORED HER.

00:59.190 --> 01:02.284
SO IT'S LIKE CREATIVE
NON-FICTION WITH PSEUDONYMS?

01:02.330 --> 01:03.820
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
BUT SURE.

01:03.860 --> 01:07.694
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU
HELD ONTO THIS SINCE RAVENSWOOD.

01:07.730 --> 01:10.460
WE KNEW THAT ALI HAD JOURNALS.
WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT THIS ONE?

01:10.500 --> 01:14.732
BECAUSE THE STORIES IN THERE,
THEY'RE...

01:14.770 --> 01:16.465
THEY'RE PERSONAL.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.535
PERSONAL ABOUT ALI?

01:18.570 --> 01:19.935
ABOUT ALI AND US.

01:19.980 --> 01:24.405
THERE ARE THINGS IN THERE
THAT WE MAY NOT KNOW
ABOUT EACH OTHER,

01:24.450 --> 01:28.170
AND THINGS FROM THE PAST
THAT WE WANT TO FORGET.

01:28.220 --> 01:30.438
SO YOU THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD GET TO READ IT,
AND WE DON'T?

01:30.490 --> 01:32.515
I JUST DIDN'T SEE THE POINT
OF BRINGING ALL THAT UP AGAIN.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.187
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
FOCUSED ON FINDING ALI.

01:34.220 --> 01:36.324
THAT'S NOT YOUR CALL TO MAKE.
I KNOW.
I MADE A MISTAKE!

01:36.360 --> 01:39.523
AND IT TOOK YOU TILL NOW
TO REALIZE THAT?
EM, I SAID I WAS SORRY!

01:39.560 --> 01:41.357
DID YOU?
OKAY! GUYS...

01:41.400 --> 01:44.460
ALL RIGHT. THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IS THAT
WE HAVE THIS NOW.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.890
OKAY, HANNA, YOU SAID
THAT THERE ARE STORIES
IN HERE ABOUT ALI.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.306
WHAT ABOUT "BOARD SHORTS"
OR SOMEONE ELSE WHO
MIGHT HAVE BEEN AFI'ER HER?

01:50.340 --> 01:52.205
THERE MIGHT BE.
I DON'T KNOW.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.538
I JUST COULDN'T PUT
ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER
ON MY OWN.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.309
SO THIS IS WHAT WE DO.
WE EACH TAKE TURNS,

01:56.350 --> 01:59.148
WE'LL WEED OUT
THE STORIES ABOUT US
AND SEE WHAT'S LEFI' OVER.

01:59.180 --> 02:00.841
WHO GOES FIRST?

02:00.880 --> 02:02.040
I DO.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.889
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT *

02:08.920 --> 02:11.582
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

02:11.630 --> 02:13.928
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

02:13.960 --> 02:16.667
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

02:16.700 --> 02:21.728
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I'LL KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

02:21.770 --> 02:24.238
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

02:24.270 --> 02:26.738
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

02:40.420 --> 02:41.956
ALISON?

02:41.990 --> 02:44.288
EMILY...

02:44.330 --> 02:47.527
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I'VE MISSED YOU.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.620
MISSED ME?
I'VE BEEN HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.365
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S BEEN GONE.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.867
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.959
YOU CHOSE THIS.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.662
YOU CHOSE THIS FOR YOU,
YOU CHOSE THIS FOR US...

02:58.710 --> 03:00.905
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

03:00.940 --> 03:04.546
I KNOW I HURT YOU THE MOST.
BUT I WANT TO EXPLAIN.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.309
BUT YOU CAN'T.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.578
BUT I CAN.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.544
I HAVE TO.
I OWE THAT TO YOU.

03:10.590 --> 03:13.559
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

03:13.590 --> 03:15.751
YOU'RE RIGHT, I DON'T.

03:15.790 --> 03:18.384
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,
EITHER.

03:18.430 --> 03:19.988
I SAVED YOUR LIFE.

03:20.030 --> 03:22.567
TWICE. I RISKED
EVERYTHING FOR YOU.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.363
YOU DESTROYED ME, OKAY?!

03:24.400 --> 03:25.560
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!

03:27.600 --> 03:29.192
BUT I'M NOT.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.738
AREN'T YOU GLAD
THAT I'M NOT?

03:45.820 --> 03:47.708
I REMEMBER WRITING THIS.

03:49.890 --> 03:52.358
YOU AND ME...

03:52.400 --> 03:54.288
AT THE KISSING ROCK.

03:54.330 --> 03:56.321
I THOUGHT I WAS
BEING SMART,

03:56.370 --> 03:59.669
LOCKING IT ALL UP
IN A JOURNAL.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.032
BUT THEY TOOK EVERYTHING,
DIDN'T THEY?

04:02.070 --> 04:04.459
WHO, ALI?
WHO TOOK EVERYTHING?

04:04.510 --> 04:06.000
WHO'S AFTER YOU?

04:07.380 --> 04:09.644
I DON'T KNOW.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.712
I BET YOU'RE WONDERING
WHICH ONE'S REAL...

04:17.790 --> 04:21.282
THE GIRL IN FRONT OF YOU
OR THE ONE WHO WROTE THAT.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.355
SO AM I.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.426
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU.

04:27.460 --> 04:30.964
YOU ALWAYS SAW
THE BEST VERSION OF ME...

04:31.000 --> 04:32.865
THE PERSON I WANT TO BE.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.800
I DON'T SEE THAT
ANYMORE.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.479
YOU STILL WEAR IT.

04:47.550 --> 04:49.586
( alarm clock ringing )

05:29.960 --> 05:33.418
MY GOD, YOU'RE UP.
YEAH.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.758
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO
HAVE TO DRAG YOU TO SCHOOL...

05:35.800 --> 05:36.926
BY YOUR SWEAT PANTS.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.689
WELL, NO SWEAT PANTS.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.594
I SEE THAT.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.006
SO, IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY
AT YOUR NEW JOB.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.507
ARE YOU EXCITED?

05:45.540 --> 05:47.076
RELIEVED.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.472
SO YOU'RE OKAY?

05:50.510 --> 05:51.841
DID YOU TALK TO CALEB?

05:51.880 --> 05:54.769
YEAH, WE TALKED.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.617
AND?

06:04.730 --> 06:07.426
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED,

06:07.460 --> 06:08.996
WHAT YOU HAD WAS REAL.

06:09.030 --> 06:11.726
I KNOW IT WAS.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.590
NOTHING CHANGES THAT.

06:15.770 --> 06:17.761
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOUR DAD LEI-TI",
IT WAS COMPLETELY--

06:17.810 --> 06:20.608
MOM. I REALLY HAVE TO
GET READY FOR SCHOOL.

06:23.610 --> 06:25.498
I'LL MAKE US SOME EGGS, OKAY?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.078
(TVon)

06:36.120 --> 06:38.588
HOUSEKEEPING!

06:38.630 --> 06:40.518
HEY.
SHOULDN'T YOU BE DRESSED?

06:40.560 --> 06:42.118
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
MEETING MY DAD SOON.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.823
HE CANCELED
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.792
SAID HE'S IN LITIGATION
ALL DAY.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.131
WHAT, SPENCER?

06:53.180 --> 06:56.069
NOTHING, I JUST--

06:56.110 --> 06:58.874
I'M-I'M GLAD
THAT HE CANCELED.

06:58.910 --> 07:01.743
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T THINK
IT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA,

07:01.780 --> 07:03.543
GETTING HIM INVOLVED.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.046
YOU HEARD WHAT
YOUR DAD SAID.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.957
IF THIS HAPPENED TO ME,
THEN THIS HAS HAPPENED
TO OTHERS.

07:07.990 --> 07:09.878
RADLEY SHOULD BE
SHUT DOWN.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.727
YEAH, AND THAT MIGHT BE TRUE,

07:11.760 --> 07:14.456
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY
HE'S HELPING YOU.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.525
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.458
THERE'S A LOT
THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.092
ASTROPHYSICS.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.630
PORTUGUESE.
MM-HMM.

07:21.670 --> 07:23.934
HOW TO MAKE FLAN.
I'M BEING SERIOUS.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.460
SO AM I.

07:25.510 --> 07:27.068
I WANT TO DO THIS.

07:27.110 --> 07:29.101
I NEED TO.

07:31.810 --> 07:33.038
OKAY.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.015
I'LL TALK TO MY DAD.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.020
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:45.730 --> 07:48.927
IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT MY MORNING'S
ALL FREED UP.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.894
OH...

07:53.300 --> 07:54.699
MMM.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.833
I DO KNOW
HOW TO MAKE FLAN.

07:56.870 --> 07:59.668
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

08:39.880 --> 08:41.745
OKAY, LET'S GO.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.281
WAS I JUST THE LOOKOUT?

08:43.320 --> 08:45.880
DID I TELL YOU TO WHISTLE
IF YOU SAW SOMETHING?

08:45.920 --> 08:47.148
NO.

08:47.190 --> 08:49.920
NO, YOU WERE NOT
THE LOOKOUT.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.587
HOW ARE THINGS GOING

08:51.630 --> 08:54.258
IN THE, UH,
ROMANTIC LIT DEPARTMENT?

08:54.300 --> 08:57.098
ALL RIGHT, THAT DEPARTMENT'S
BEEN SHUT DOWN.

08:57.130 --> 08:59.269
I WAS JUST
RETURNING A PEN.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.562
REALLY?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.090
YES, REALLY.

09:02.140 --> 09:03.767
HE'S VERY PICKY
ABOUT HIS PENS.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.334
I-I BORROWED ONE
LAST WEEK,

09:05.370 --> 09:07.235
SO I THOUGHT
THAT I WOULD RETURN IT.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.272
WHAT'S HIS BRAND?
HELLO, THIRD DEGREE.

09:11.710 --> 09:15.669
IT'S A FISHER BALLPOINT PEN
WITH A CUSTOM NIB.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.278
DID I PASS?

09:17.320 --> 09:20.983
THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS,
"I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A STUPID PEN."

09:21.020 --> 09:22.658
YOU STILL LOVE HIM.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.578
WHETHER I DO OR I DON'T,

09:24.630 --> 09:26.928
I'M JUST TRYING TO
FIGURE THINGS OUT WITH JAKE.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.029
SO LET ME HELP YOU.

09:28.060 --> 09:31.223
YOU LIKE JAKE.
YOU LOVE EZRA.

09:31.270 --> 09:33.568
I'M WORKING ON IT.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.802
HEY.
HEY.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.376
IS IT A PAGE-TURNER?

09:40.410 --> 09:43.208
YESTERDAY I COULD BARELY
MAKE IT THROUGH THE FIRST
STORY THAT WAS ABOUT ME.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.673
WHAT CHANGED?
I WANT ANSWERS.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.816
FROM ALI, FROM THIS BOOK--
I'LL TAKE 'EM ANWVHERE
I CAN GET 'EM.

09:48.850 --> 09:50.943
I'M GREEN, YOU ARE BLUE,

09:50.990 --> 09:53.959
YOU ARE PURPLE,
HANNA'S PINK,
ALI'S YELLOW,

09:53.990 --> 09:56.288
AND WHITE IS FOR WHENEVER
WE DON'T KNOW WHO
THE STORY'S ABOUT.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.322
WOW. THAT IS SO NEAT OF YOU.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.692
ACTUALLY,
IT'S SO PAM FIELDS OF ME.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.152
I'M BECOMING MY MOTHER.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.963
SO, HOW BAD IS IT?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.865
IT'S WEIRD.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.492
THERE'S ONE STORY
WHERE SHE SAYS

10:07.540 --> 10:10.907
I'M SO DESPERATELY IN LOVE
WITH HER I'D ROB A BANK FOR HER
IF SHE ASKED ME TO,

10:10.940 --> 10:13.272
AND THEN ANOTHER WHERE SHE SAYS
I ALWAYS PUT MY FRIENDS FIRST

10:13.310 --> 10:16.199
AND SHE WISHES
SHE WAS MORE LIKE ME.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.208
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:18.250 --> 10:19.740
EMILY HAS A SYSTEM.

10:21.350 --> 10:22.988
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU READ?

10:23.020 --> 10:24.885
ENOUGH TO NEED A BREAK.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.855
WHO'S NEXT?
PURPLE OR BLUE?

10:27.890 --> 10:29.152
SPENCER.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.955
SHE'S BETTER
WITH THE CLUES.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.935
SO, YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US.
HOW'S CALEB?

10:40.970 --> 10:43.700
FINE.
DID YOU GUYS KNOW
THAT ALI WROTE POETRY?

10:43.740 --> 10:44.866
WHEN DO WE GET
TO SEE HIM?

10:44.910 --> 10:47.799
YOU DON'T.
HE LEFT ALREADY.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.239
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE LEFT?

10:49.280 --> 10:51.771
I MEAN HE GOT IN HIS CAR
AND HE DROVE AWAY.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.914
TO WHERE?
TO RAVENSWOOD?

10:53.950 --> 10:55.941
YEAH, WHEN'S
HE COMING BACK?
HE'S NOT.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.141
WE BROKE UP.
OH, MY GOD.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.284
ARE YOU OKAY?
OH, YEAH, NO,
I'M TOTALLY FINE.

11:01.320 --> 11:05.086
I JUST--YOU KNOW, WE JUST
NEEDED TO MOVE ON, AND...

11:05.130 --> 11:07.826
WE DECIDED TO MAKE
A CLEAN BREAK.

11:07.860 --> 11:09.293
YOU BO DECIDED THIS?

11:09.330 --> 11:11.218
Hanna: I DON'T KNOW
IF I'VE READ THIS ONE.
HANNA.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.397
"I USED TO GO THERE
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.089
"BACK THEN
THE BUMBLEBEE WAS BRIGHT,

11:15.140 --> 11:18.007
NEON YELLOW LITTLE FELLOW,
NOW HE'S LOST HIS LIGHT."

11:18.040 --> 11:20.270
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT,

11:20.310 --> 11:22.744
BUT RHYMES OKAY.

11:22.780 --> 11:25.749
YEAH. YEAH,
IT'S, UH,

11:25.780 --> 11:27.748
IT'S NOT BAD.
WAIT. WAIT.
GIVE ME THAT.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.218
WAIT. ALI'S DESCRIBING
THE BUSY BEE INN.

11:32.250 --> 11:35.048
I USED TO GO THERE
LIKE A MILLION YEARS AGO
WITH MY FAMILY.

11:35.090 --> 11:38.127
WE'D GO TO THAT AQUARIUM
IN KILLINGWORTH,

11:38.160 --> 11:41.129
AND THEN WE'D HAVE DINNER
AT THE BED AND BREAKFAST.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.025
"BROKE THE LATCH
AND LEFT IT HANGING,

11:43.070 --> 11:44.264
"DON'T THINK THE KEEP WILL MIND,

11:44.300 --> 11:47.167
NO ONE THERE TO MAKE REPAIRS,
THE PERFECT PLACE TO HIDE."

11:47.200 --> 11:49.805
IT'S THE PERFECT HIDEAWAY--
AN EMPTY BED AND BREAKFAST,

11:49.840 --> 11:53.139
SHE LEFT THE DOOR UNLOCKED,
READY FOR HER RETURN.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.044
THE BUSY BEE INN
HAS BEEN CLOSED
FOR YEARS NOW.

12:04.090 --> 12:07.355
THE BUILDING'S STILL THERE,
SIGN AND ALL, BUT...

12:07.390 --> 12:09.449
WE HAVE TO GO THERE TODAY.

12:09.490 --> 12:12.482
I DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT ONE POEM IS
ENOUGH TO GO ON.

12:12.530 --> 12:13.622
IT IS WHEN IT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.821
YOU HEARD SPENCER.
SHE COULD BE HIDING
OUT THERE.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.795
UH, YEAH, THEN I THINK
WE SHOULD GO CHECK IT OUT.

12:18.830 --> 12:21.367
I FINISH WORK AT SIX.
ARIA?

12:21.400 --> 12:23.334
YEAH. NO,
THAT WORKS FOR ME.

12:41.020 --> 12:43.420
Tara: EM,
BEV'S BEHIND YOU.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.455
OH.
THANKS, BEV.

13:04.610 --> 13:07.010
TARA,
I HAVE TO LEAVE EARLY.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.938
CAN YOU
COVER MY SHIFT?

13:08.980 --> 13:10.242
THANK YOU.

13:15.860 --> 13:17.885
( typing )

13:22.460 --> 13:23.427
HEY.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.222
HI.

13:25.270 --> 13:27.363
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON
SO INTENTLY?

13:27.400 --> 13:30.858
UH, NOTHING.
IT'S THE END OF A STORY.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.902
IT'S NOT READY FOR
PUBLIC CONSUMPTION YET.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.805
I GOT YOUR NOTE.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.372
UH, ABOUT TONIGHT--

13:39.410 --> 13:42.277
I CAN'T NOW.
SOMETHING CAME UP.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.582
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

13:43.620 --> 13:46.282
HANNA AND CALEB,
THEY BROKE UP, SO...

13:46.320 --> 13:47.878
EMILY JUST THOUGHT
IT'D BE A GOOD IDEA

13:47.920 --> 13:49.251
FOR US TO GET OUT OF TOWN
FOR THE NIGHT AND...

13:49.290 --> 13:51.258
KIND OF GET HER MIND
OFF OF THINGS.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.929
AND I COULDN'T TELL THEM
THAT I HAD PLANS.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.019
OH, NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT.

13:56.060 --> 13:57.925
UM, YOU'RE ALL GOING?

13:57.970 --> 13:59.221
YEAH.

13:59.270 --> 14:01.488
ANYWHERE SPECIAL?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.831
EMILY'S MAKING
A RESERVATION SOMEWHERE.

14:08.210 --> 14:11.475
AND H HAVE
A STACK OF PAPERS
TO GRADE, ANYWAY.

14:11.510 --> 14:14.513
SO. . .TOMORROW?

14:18.950 --> 14:21.089
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,

14:21.120 --> 14:24.055
IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
THERE WAS ANYONE ELSE.

14:24.090 --> 14:26.354
IT FELT RIGHT.

14:26.390 --> 14:28.551
I KNOW.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.888
THIS ISN'T FAIR
FOR EITHER OF YOU.

14:31.930 --> 14:33.488
OR YOU.

14:43.680 --> 14:47.218
( door opens, closes )

15:02.300 --> 15:04.689
Ali on tape:
YOU STILL CAN'T SEE
WHO'S THREATENING ME?

15:04.730 --> 15:06.664
LOOK, I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE TO GO,

15:06.700 --> 15:10.329
I NEED TO MAKE A PLAN,
SOME SORT OF ESCAPE,

15:10.370 --> 15:12.634
I DON'T KNOW,
A WAY TO NOT BE...

15:12.670 --> 15:15.002
ALISON DiLAURENTIS ANYMORE.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.576
CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME?

15:31.430 --> 15:36.550
* SECRET HIDDEN UNDERNEATH IT

15:36.600 --> 15:39.728
* TRYING HARD TO KEEP IT

15:39.770 --> 15:43.103
* SAFELY OUT OF REACH

15:45.070 --> 15:49.632
* CREEPING, I CAN
FEEL IT BREATHING *

15:49.680 --> 15:53.309
* COMING TO THE SURFACE

15:53.350 --> 15:56.410
* FIND ME IN MY DREAMS

15:57.490 --> 15:59.640
* OH, SWEET DESPAIR

15:59.690 --> 16:03.148
* FEEL YOU DEVOUR ME

16:03.190 --> 16:06.455
* OH, OH, SILENTLY

16:06.490 --> 16:09.493
* OH, WON'T YOU CARRY ME

16:09.530 --> 16:12.090
* HOME

16:17.210 --> 16:20.475
* OOH, I SURRENDER

16:20.510 --> 16:23.070
* OOH, I SURRENDER *

16:23.110 --> 16:26.147
YEAH, COULD YOU REMIND MY DAD
TO CALL TOBY CAVANAUGH

16:26.180 --> 16:27.511
WHEN HE GETS OUT
OF HIS MEETING?

16:27.550 --> 16:29.177
HE'LL KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

16:29.220 --> 16:33.213
Jessica: THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
Peter: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.012
DOES JASON KNOW?

16:35.060 --> 16:38.120
NO. HE DOESN'T NEED TO.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.027
ACTUALLY, DESI...

16:41.060 --> 16:42.618
I CAN JUST
TELL HIM MYSELF.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.423
THAN KS.

16:44.470 --> 16:48.167
SPENCER. DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
HOME YET.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.634
YEAH. LIKEWISE.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.729
UH, DO YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU NEED?

16:52.770 --> 16:54.237
YES. THANK YOU.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.578
AND WHAT DOESN'T
JASON KNOW?

16:59.750 --> 17:02.310
KEN AND I ARE
GETTING A DIVORCE,

17:02.350 --> 17:04.545
AND I'D LIKE TO TELL JASON
IN PERSON.

17:04.590 --> 17:07.809
I GO TO COURT NEXT WEEK,
AND SO YOUR FATHER
WAS KIND ENOUGH

17:07.860 --> 17:11.352
TO LEND ME SOME OF
HIS LEGAL EXPERTISE.

17:11.390 --> 17:15.599
WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET TO THE POST OFFICE
BEFORE IT CLOSES.

17:15.630 --> 17:17.120
THANKS AGAIN.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.058
I'LL UH, WALK YOU OUT.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.268
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WANT ONE.

17:32.310 --> 17:33.572
IT'S ON ME.

17:33.620 --> 17:34.814
OH, NO THAN KS.

17:34.850 --> 17:37.387
ONE LEADS TO A DOZEN.

17:37.420 --> 17:39.411
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.088
LOW ON JET FUEL.

17:42.690 --> 17:45.818
SO, DID YOU...
WANT SOMETHING,

17:45.860 --> 17:48.158
OR YOU JUST
GONNA STAND THERE?

17:48.200 --> 17:50.225
UH, STAND THERE.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.522
YEAH, I WAS LOOKING
FOR MY FRIEND WHO WORKS HERE,

17:52.570 --> 17:54.390
BUT SHE MUST HAVE
GONE HOME ALREADY.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.839
OH.

17:55.870 --> 17:58.430
CAN I GET A MEDIUM COFFEE?

17:58.470 --> 18:00.176
THANK YOU.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.804
SO DID YOU HEAR THE LATEST?
ABOUT CECE?

18:02.840 --> 18:04.569
YEAH, IT JUST BROKE
ON THE NEWS.

18:04.610 --> 18:06.498
APPARENTLY SOMEONE SAW HER
AT A TRAIN STATION IN MARYLAND.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.677
BY THE TIME THE COPS SHOWED,
SHE WAS GONE.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.449
BUT THEY HAVE A TRAIL NOW.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.811
AND IT WAS DEFINITELY HER?

18:12.850 --> 18:14.579
THEY HAVE THE SECURITY
FOOTAGE AND EVERYTHING.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.281
DO THEY KNOW
WHY SHE DID IT?

18:16.320 --> 18:18.720
APPARENTLY CECE WAS
PRETTY HARD ON CASH.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.320
THEN SHE MADE A FEW
BIG DEPOSITS BEFORE HIS DEATH.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.727
WAIT, THEY THINK
THAT SOMEONE PAID HER
TO KILL WILDEN?

18:24.770 --> 18:27.193
LOTS OF PEOPLE
WANTED HIM DEAD.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.492
THANK YOU.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.338
UM, WELL, THANKS
FOR LETTING ME KNOW.

18:32.370 --> 18:36.204
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

18:36.240 --> 18:39.607
SHE'S GOOD.
SHE JUST STARTED
A NEW JOB TODAY.

18:39.650 --> 18:43.484
AND THE BANK, WELL,
IT TURNS OUT PEOPLE
STILL READ THE PAPERS.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.216
AND...CALEB?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.787
HE'S FINE.

18:48.820 --> 18:52.278
UM, I SHOULD GO
TELL MY MOM ABOUT CECE.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.888
YEAH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

18:53.930 --> 18:56.694
WELL, IT WAS GOOD
TO SEE YOU.
YOU TOO.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.302
Spencer: THREE DAYS AGO
YOU LITERALLY BANNED ME
FROM TALKING TO HER,

19:04.340 --> 19:06.706
AND NOW I FIND YOU
ALONE WITH HER IN THIS HOUSE

19:06.740 --> 19:08.435
WHILE MOM IS AWAY
ON BUSINESS!

19:08.480 --> 19:09.833
WERE YOU WITH HER ALL DAY?

19:09.880 --> 19:11.768
IS THAT WHY YOU
CANCELED ON TOBY?

19:11.810 --> 19:14.779
NO. AND I DON'T LIKE
WHAT I'M BEING ACCUSED OF.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.344
DO YOU THINK I LIKE IT?!

19:16.380 --> 19:18.644
JESSICA'S HUSBAND
IS LAWYERING UP AGAINST HER.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.954
SHE WAS UPSET.
SHE NEEDED SOME LEGAL ADVICE.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.356
OH, WHAT, AND YOU'RE
THE ONLY BARRISTER IN TOWN?

19:23.390 --> 19:25.529
HEY, SPENCER--
YES, FATHER?

19:27.930 --> 19:30.694
OKAY...

19:30.730 --> 19:34.496
I CANCELED ON TOBY
BECAUSE I HEARD FROM RADLEY

19:34.540 --> 19:37.509
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL HIM.
TELL HIM WHAT?

19:37.540 --> 19:41.374
HIS MOTHER'S DEATH
WAS AN ACCIDENT.
NO ONE WAS AT FAULT.

19:43.710 --> 19:45.439
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.914
THAT'S BEFORE I HAD
ALL THE INFORMATION.

19:47.950 --> 19:50.544
MARIAN WAS ON THE ROOF.
SHE SLIPPED AND SHE FELL.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.785
BUT THERE WAS
ANOTHER PATIENT THERE.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.959
THEY COVERED UP THE TRUTH
TO PROTECT THAT PATIENT.

19:54.990 --> 19:57.788
APPARENTLY THEY'RE FRAGILE.
WHAT?

19:57.830 --> 20:00.253
MARIAN'S DEATH
WASN'T A SUICIDE,

20:00.300 --> 20:02.291
BUT IT WASN'T A MURDER,
EITHER.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.673
HELLO AGAIN, SPENCER.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.644
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

20:52.680 --> 20:55.740
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND MY DAD,

20:55.780 --> 20:57.839
BUT YOU NEED TO
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

20:57.890 --> 21:01.587
SPENCER, HONEY,
I THINK YOU HAVE
A VERY WRONG IMPRESSION--

21:01.620 --> 21:03.759
THERE ARE PLENTY OF
OTHER LAWYERS IN THIS TOWN.

21:03.790 --> 21:07.453
FIND ONE YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT WITH
AND KEEP MY FAMILY OUT OF IT!

21:27.650 --> 21:29.948
Emily: HEY.
Spencer: YOU'RE LATE.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.516
YEAH, SORRY.

21:31.550 --> 21:34.610
H EY.
HEY, HAN.

21:34.660 --> 21:35.752
( GPS beeping )

21:35.790 --> 21:39.521
GPS: CALCULATING DISTANCE
TO THE BUSY BEE INN,

21:39.560 --> 21:41.391
KILLINGWORTH.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.799
Spencer: HEY, DID
YOU GUYS HEAR THE NEWS?

21:44.830 --> 21:46.889
WE GOT IT FROM HANNA.
CECE'S IN MARYLAND.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.932
HAVEN'T WE FOUND
ANYTHING IN THE BOOK
ABOUT CECE?

21:48.970 --> 21:50.938
NOT YET.
WELL, FORGET CECE,

21:50.970 --> 21:53.609
I WANT TO KNOW WHO PUT HER
ON THE PAYROLL. BOOK, PLEASE.

21:55.510 --> 21:56.670
THANK YOU.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.547
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

22:01.580 --> 22:03.013
GREAT.

22:03.050 --> 22:04.813
I MEAN ABOUT CALEB.

22:04.850 --> 22:06.647
SO DO I.

22:10.860 --> 22:13.590
Hanna: HEY, WHERE WERE YOU?
Emily: WHEN?

22:13.630 --> 22:16.394
WHEN I WAS AT THE BREW
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE.

22:16.430 --> 22:19.365
I HAD TO RUN AN ERRAND
FOR MY MOM.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.994
I GET THAT
WHEN YOU GET CARSICK.

22:26.010 --> 22:28.069
SO SORRY TO
BOTHER YOU AT HOME.

22:28.110 --> 22:29.907
MUST BE IMPORTANT.

22:29.940 --> 22:31.578
IS HANNA HERE?

22:31.610 --> 22:33.840
NO, SHE'S OUT WITH FRIENDS.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.678
OH. WELL,
I COULD COME BACK.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.540
MR. FITZ,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:38.590 --> 22:40.046
WELL, I WAS HOPING
TO SAY THIS TO
THE BOTH OF YOU,

22:40.090 --> 22:42.115
BUT PERHAPS THIS IS BETTER.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.128
I MADE A MISTAKE.

22:44.160 --> 22:48.494
I KNEW THAT HANNA
WAS HAVING A HARD TIME
HERE AT HOME,

22:48.530 --> 22:51.169
SO I GAVE HER AN EXTENSION
ON HER SCHOOLWORK.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.863
BUT NOW WE'RE AT A PLACE
WHERE IF SHE DOESN'T HAND IN
SOME OF THAT SCHOOLWORK,

22:54.900 --> 22:56.128
SHE MIGHT FAIL THE CLASS.

22:56.170 --> 22:58.001
I HAD NO IDEA.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.679
I'M HAPPY TO STAY WITH HER
AFTER SCHOOL,

23:00.710 --> 23:04.806
AND A FEW HOURS EVERY WEEK
COULD REALLY HELP.

23:04.850 --> 23:06.147
UM--
( phone rings )

23:06.180 --> 23:10.788
BUT SHE COULD REALLY STAND
TO HAVE SOME EXTRA
ENCOURAGEMENT AT HOME.

23:10.820 --> 23:13.653
( phone continues ringing )
MAYBE WE COULD
SET UP A SCHEDULE.

23:13.690 --> 23:15.089
WHATEVER I CAN DO TO HELP.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.680
I'M SORRY, THAT'S
MY NEW WORK PHONE, AND--

23:17.730 --> 23:19.152
OH, PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.522
THIS MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.529
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
I CAN ENTERTAIN MYSELF.

23:26.670 --> 23:28.729
DiLAURENTIS PROPERTIES.

23:28.770 --> 23:31.659
UM, SURE.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.508
WHICH UNIT ARE YOU IN?

23:34.540 --> 23:37.077
WHAT KIND OF LEAK?

23:39.010 --> 23:40.409
OKAY, UM...

23:42.720 --> 23:45.939
OKAY, CAN YOU TELL WHERE
THE WATER'S COMING FROM?

23:45.990 --> 23:47.878
I'M LOOKING FOR IT
RIGHT NOW. LET'S SEE...

23:47.920 --> 23:50.718
THE SECOND FLOOR,
UNIT B. OKAY.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.119
GPS: CONTINUE TO EXIT 48.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.549
OKAY, "HUMAN CHEAT SHEET"
HAS GOTTA BE SPENCER,

23:56.600 --> 23:58.898
BUT WHO IS "SUZY CLUELESS"?

23:58.930 --> 24:01.137
(weakly )
LET ME SEE.

24:01.170 --> 24:04.162
YOU KNOW YOU DO NOT GET TO
THROW UP ON ME, RIGHT?

24:06.710 --> 24:08.075
( turns on radio )

24:08.110 --> 24:10.999
CAN YOU TURN IT DOWN?

24:11.050 --> 24:13.610
I THOUGHT
THIS WAS A ROAD TRIP.

24:13.650 --> 24:16.642
TO FIND OUR
NO-LONGER-DEAD FRIEND.
THIS ISN'T SPRING BREAK.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.114
ALI'S FRIEND'S DAD
IS HAVING AN AFFAIR,

24:19.150 --> 24:20.811
BUT THE GIRL SUZY CLUELESS
DOESN'T KNOW.

24:20.860 --> 24:24.159
OKAY, WELL,
EENY-MEENIE-MINEY-MO.

24:24.190 --> 24:25.782
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
ANY ONE OF US.

24:25.830 --> 24:27.889
OH. MYSTERY SOLVED.
IT'S ME.

24:27.930 --> 24:28.999
WHY, WHAT DOES IT SAY?

24:29.030 --> 24:31.498
"DESPITE HER FREAKISH
PINK HAIR DYE,

24:31.530 --> 24:34.590
I HAVE ALWAYS ADMIRED SUZY
FOR HER GREAT SENSE OF STYLE."

24:34.640 --> 24:36.062
HUH. HOW TOUCHING.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.761
PURPLE ME.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.478
THAN KS.

24:47.850 --> 24:49.977
EM, DID--
DID YOU READ THIS?

24:50.020 --> 24:51.885
"THE CRADLE ROBBER"?

24:51.920 --> 24:54.980
WHEN DID ALI HAVE
A SECRET RENDEZVOUS
WITH A YOUNGER GUY?

24:55.020 --> 24:57.113
GOD, I LOVE THIS SONG.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.219
( turns up radio )
GPS: CONSTRUCTION AHEAD.

24:59.260 --> 25:02.593
PLEASE WAIT FOR RE-ROUTE.
SERIOUSLY, HAN?

25:02.630 --> 25:05.599
( turns radio down )
Aria: DO YOU THINK THAT
THIS COULD BE ABOUT ALI?

25:05.630 --> 25:07.837
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR AN OLDER GUY,

25:07.870 --> 25:11.601
BUT WHAT IF SHE LIED?
WHAT IF THE GUY WAS YOUNGER?

25:11.640 --> 25:14.108
IN ONE-QUARTER MILE,
TURN RIGHT.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.239
(Ashley on phone downstairs )

25:20.280 --> 25:24.546
YEAH, I SEE UNIT 5D...

25:24.590 --> 25:26.217
BUT NO UNIT 5J.

25:40.270 --> 25:43.159
OH! I MUST HAVE
MISHEARD YOU.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.760
UM, CAN YOU TELL WHERE
THE WATER IS COMING FROM?

25:45.810 --> 25:48.176
YEAH, I'M GONNA GET YOU
THE NAME OF THE SUPER.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.770
Ashley:
HE'S IN UNIT B.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.903
WE ALL SET?

25:52.950 --> 25:55.009
OKAY. UM...

25:55.050 --> 25:57.041
THE SMOKE DETECTOR?

26:02.890 --> 26:06.155
ALL RIGHT, THESE COMPLAINTS
ARE REALLY SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR SUPER.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.852
YES, I CAN GET YOU
THAT PHONE NUMBER.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.998
( Ashley continues
on phone downstairs )

26:21.710 --> 26:23.746
( tapping on keyboard )

26:29.980 --> 26:31.345
(thunder)

26:32.720 --> 26:37.282
WHEN I SAID I COULD USE
A PIT STOP, I DIDN'T MEAN
IN AN ACTUAL PIT.

26:37.320 --> 26:40.756
I WAS FOLLOWING THE GPS.
I MUST HAVE MISSED A TURN.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.256
OKAY, WELL, JUST GET BACK
ON THE HIGHWAY.

26:42.300 --> 26:43.927
WE CAN'T.
THERE'S CONSTRUCTION.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.768
NO, NOT ACCORDING
TO MY PHONE.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.806
ARE YOU TUINLIJING AROUND?

26:50.840 --> 26:53.001
( beep )
ARE YOUNSCSI'OPPING?

26:53.040 --> 26:56.339
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.
THE ENGINE STOPPED WORKING.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.772
Hanna: DO YOU SEE
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS?

27:00.820 --> 27:03.243
I CAN BARELY SEE IT.

27:03.280 --> 27:06.738
OKAY, THERE'S THE RADIATOR,

27:06.790 --> 27:09.850
UH, THERE'S THE DIPSTICK,

27:09.890 --> 27:12.950
THERE'S...
LET'S JUST HYPOTH ETICALLY SAY

27:12.990 --> 27:14.719
YOU COULD FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE ENGINE.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.228
WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW TO FIX IT?

27:17.260 --> 27:19.399
PROBABLY NOT.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.398
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.102
GUYS, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
TOBY THINKS I'M AT
A STUDY GROUP.

27:24.140 --> 27:26.131
SAME WITH PAIGE.

27:26.170 --> 27:28.035
WELL, I TEXTED TRAVIS.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.379
HE HAS A TOW TRUCK,
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW ENOUGH
TO ASK QUESTIONS.

27:31.410 --> 27:34.277
WE ARE ABOUT TEN MINUTES AWAY
FROM A COMPLETE DOWNPOUR.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.244
(thunder)
( cell phone chimes )

27:39.150 --> 27:40.811
IT'S TRAVIS.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.158
HE CAN GET US,
BUT IT'LL BE TWO HOURS.

27:44.430 --> 27:47.354
I'M DEFINITELY GONNA
HAVE TO PEE BEFORE THEN.

27:47.390 --> 27:48.926
( tapping smartphone pad )

27:51.200 --> 27:53.020
I KNOW A PLACE
WE CAN WAIT.

27:53.070 --> 27:55.789
WHERE?
A CABIN.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.831
IT'S MY UNCLE'S.
IT'S CLOSE BY.

27:57.870 --> 28:00.464
DOES IT HAVE A BATHROOM?
AND A FIREPLACE.

28:00.510 --> 28:02.330
LEAD THE WAY.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.773
OKAY, GREAT. THANKS.

28:06.810 --> 28:07.879
BYE.

28:16.060 --> 28:17.948
I'M SORRY THAT TOOK SO LONG.

28:19.430 --> 28:21.091
OH. NO, NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

28:28.740 --> 28:29.468
Aria: DID I JUST FEEL
A RAINDROP?

28:31.010 --> 28:33.979
ARE YOU SURE YOUR UNCLE'S CABIN
IS THIS WAY?
I'M SURE.

28:34.010 --> 28:35.978
(thunder)

28:36.010 --> 28:38.706
ANYONE ELSE
LOSE CELL SERVICE?

28:41.320 --> 28:45.814
THERE'S A PAGE MISSING...
IN THE STORY ABOUT
THE CRADLE ROBBER?

28:45.850 --> 28:49.354
DO YOU THINK "A" TOOK IT?
MAYBE.

28:49.390 --> 28:52.826
WERE ALL THE PAGES IN THE BOOK
WHEN YOU TOOK IT
FROM HIS APARTMENT?

28:52.860 --> 28:54.794
UH, I-I DON'T KNOW.

28:54.830 --> 28:57.958
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
THAT THERE WAS
A WHOLE PAGE TORN OUT?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.491
I'VE GOT OTHER STUFF
ON MY MIND, SPENCER.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.464
THINGS THAT YOU
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

29:02.500 --> 29:05.298
NO. NO, NOT REALLY.
I'M ENTITLED TO
MY OWN PRIVACY.

29:05.340 --> 29:07.467
NOT WHEN IT AFFECTS US.
OR ALI.

29:07.510 --> 29:09.375
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

29:09.410 --> 29:12.106
DID YOU TAKE THE PAGE
OUT OF NLCIJI'S BOOK?

29:12.150 --> 29:15.278
AND IT'S NOT GONNA BRING US
ANY CLOSER TO ALISON,

29:15.320 --> 29:18.187
EVERYONE KNOWING
WHO DID WHAT
BEHIND WHOSE BACK.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.881
(thunder)

29:35.870 --> 29:37.189
Emily: THIS IT?
Aria: YEAH.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.333
JUST LET ME GO FIND THE KEY.

29:55.090 --> 29:56.557
GOT IT.

29:56.590 --> 29:58.080
COME ON.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.467
WHERE'S THE BATH ROOM?

30:10.500 --> 30:12.058
THERE.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.838
THIS PLACE IS GREAT.
YOU SHOULD BRING JAKE HERE.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.939
WHICH UNCLE IS IT
WHO OWNS THIS CABIN?

30:23.990 --> 30:26.242
IT'S...MY MOM'S BROTHER.

30:26.290 --> 30:28.451
THE ORTHODONTIST?
HE PAINTS?

30:28.490 --> 30:31.323
YEAH. IN HIS FREE TIME.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.453
NO, NO, NO.
DON'T TOUCH THAT.
PUT IT DOWN.

30:33.490 --> 30:36.550
JUST-- JUST BE CAREFUL
ABOUT MOVING ANYTHING, OKAY?

30:36.600 --> 30:37.897
OKAY.

30:40.170 --> 30:42.229
ANYBODY WANT TEA?
UH, SURE.

30:42.270 --> 30:47.003
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?
WE GET A TOW BACK HOME
AND GIVE UP ON THE B&B?

30:47.040 --> 30:50.999
WHAT IF ALI'S STILL
HIDING OUT THERE?
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG "IF."

30:51.050 --> 30:54.110
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
A LOT OF OPTIONS RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE KIND OF STRANDED.

30:54.150 --> 30:56.175
WHY DON'T WE WAIT
AND ASK HANNA?

30:56.220 --> 30:58.040
WHO KNOWS WHAT
SHE'S GOT UP HER SLEEVE?

30:58.090 --> 30:59.512
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO HARD ON HANNA?

30:59.550 --> 31:01.586
SHE'S KEEPING
SOMETHING FROM US.

31:01.620 --> 31:04.157
SHE'S UPSET ABOUT CALEB.
IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

31:04.190 --> 31:07.284
WELL, IF SHE'S HIDING SOMETHING,
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
WE WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

31:07.330 --> 31:10.026
OKAY, NOW I'M WONDERING
WHAT YOU'RE KEEPING FROM US.

31:10.060 --> 31:12.494
NOBODY'S
KEEPING ANYTHING FROM
ANYONE, ALL RIGHT?

31:12.530 --> 31:14.088
CHAMOMILE OR HIBISCUS?

31:35.520 --> 31:36.487
HAN NA.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.988
IT'S NOT ABOUT ALI...

31:39.030 --> 31:41.453
"THE CRADLE ROBBER."

31:43.000 --> 31:45.594
IT'S ABOUT ME.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.588
AND MIKE.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.164
MIKE?

31:50.200 --> 31:52.907
AS IN MY LITTLE
BROTHER MIKE?

32:00.080 --> 32:01.308
OH, MY GOD.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.011
ARIA IS GONNA DIE.

32:03.050 --> 32:06.383
WILL YOU KEEP
YOUR VOICE DOWN?
THEY'RE ALL UPSTAIRS.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.479
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
IF I DIDN'T COME DOWN?

32:08.520 --> 32:11.626
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO, DON'T TELL ME.
IT'S TOO GROSS.

32:11.660 --> 32:14.299
THAT'S ARIA'S
BABY BROTHER.

32:14.330 --> 32:16.298
HE'S TWO YEARS
YOUNGER THAN US.

32:16.330 --> 32:18.662
EXACTLY.
LOOK, ALI,

32:18.700 --> 32:21.430
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

32:21.470 --> 32:24.439
I DON'T HAVE TEN GUYS
AFTER ME AT ALL TIMES.

32:26.410 --> 32:30.130
I'M NOT SKINNY OR PERFECT
LIKE THE REST OF YOU.

32:30.180 --> 32:32.205
OH, HONEY.

32:32.250 --> 32:35.139
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO SETTLE FOR
BEING A CRADLE ROBBER.

32:35.180 --> 32:36.716
HE WAS NICE TO ME.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.115
OH, PLEASE.

32:38.150 --> 32:40.084
HE JUST WANTED TO
FEEL YOUR BOOBS.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.213
AND YOU LET HIM.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.283
(crying)
ALI, PLEASE.

32:45.330 --> 32:49.027
PLEASE JUST PROMISE ME
THAT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

32:51.430 --> 32:53.125
OKAY.

32:53.170 --> 32:56.731
I WON'T TELL ARIA
THAT YOU HOOKED UP
WITH HER BROTHER.

32:56.770 --> 32:59.568
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
SHE WOULD NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.740
AND I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.743
LOOK AT ME.

33:07.780 --> 33:12.479
SOMEDAY SOMEONE WILL LOVE YOU
FOR EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE.

33:12.520 --> 33:16.513
IT JUST MIGHT TAKE YOU LONGER
THAN THE REST OF US, THAT'S ALL.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.131
Aria: HANNA--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

33:32.170 --> 33:34.035
I KNOW IT'S AWFUL.

33:34.080 --> 33:38.107
NO. I-I ADMIT THAT
IT'S WEIRD, BUT...

33:38.150 --> 33:41.176
YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK
THAT I'D STOP BEING YOUR FRIEND

33:41.220 --> 33:42.369
JUST BECAUSE YOU...

33:42.420 --> 33:45.116
YOU KNOW, DID STUFF
WITH MY BROTHER?

33:45.150 --> 33:47.414
HONESTLY, I'M JUST
A LITTLE SHOCKED

33:47.450 --> 33:49.418
THAT HE KEPT HIS MOUTH SHUT
THIS WHOLE TIME.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.451
WELL, ALI MADE HIM.

33:51.490 --> 33:53.788
TRUST ME, HE WAS PROBABLY
MORE EMBARRASSED THAN I WAS.

33:53.830 --> 33:58.620
NO, THAT IS NOT TRUE.
HE USED TO HAVE A HUGE CRUSH
ON YOU BACK THEN.

33:58.670 --> 34:03.289
HANNA, YOU CAN'T BE THIS UPSET
OVER SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
THAT LONG AGO.

34:04.870 --> 34:08.169
HAN. . .WHAT HAPPENED?

34:08.210 --> 34:10.269
BETWEEN YOU AND CALEB.

34:12.410 --> 34:14.571
HE MET SOMEONE ELSE.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.006
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE MET SOMEONE ELSE?
WHO?

34:41.340 --> 34:43.729
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

34:43.780 --> 34:45.577
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

34:45.610 --> 34:47.601
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GO OUTSIDE
TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY SERVICE

34:47.650 --> 34:49.618
SO I CAN SEE
WHERE THE HELL TRAVIS IS.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.193
Emily: HAN.

35:03.230 --> 35:04.663
HAN NA, WAIT UP.

35:04.700 --> 35:08.192
COULD YOU JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE, PLEASE?

35:08.240 --> 35:11.300
( distant rustling )

35:11.340 --> 35:13.535
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

35:13.570 --> 35:17.176
YEAH. IT WAS...
PROBABLY JUST SOME
WILD ANIMAL OR SOMETHING.

35:17.210 --> 35:19.371
"JUST" SOME
WILD ANIMAL?

35:21.820 --> 35:23.811
FINE. YOU CAN STAY.

35:27.550 --> 35:30.610
WE SHOULD GET SOME
BLANKETS OR SOMETHING
FOR WHEN THEY COME BACK.

35:30.660 --> 35:32.355
WHERE DOES YOUR UNCLE
KEEP HIS LINENS?

35:35.260 --> 35:37.728
WHAT IS GOING ON?
NOTHING.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.490
ARE YOU AFRAID I'M GONNA
STEAL YOUR UNCLE'S LIGHT BULBS
OR SOMETHING?

35:40.530 --> 35:42.293
NO. RIGHT THERE.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.405
THESE AREN'T BLANKETS,
BUT THEY'LL BE FINE.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.799
( door slams, locks )

35:56.850 --> 35:57.942
HAN NA?!

35:57.980 --> 35:59.311
EMILY!

36:00.690 --> 36:02.749
I'M STILL NOT GETTING
ANY SERVICE.

36:02.790 --> 36:04.655
OKAY, IT'S FREEZING
OUT HERE.

36:04.690 --> 36:05.725
CAN WE PLEASE GO BACK?

36:05.760 --> 36:08.820
WE GAVE TRAVIS THE ADDRESS,
HE'S GOTTA BE CLOSE.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.661
( gasps )

36:18.710 --> 36:21.702
WHAT IS HE DOING?
DID HE FOLLOW US HERE?

36:21.740 --> 36:23.674
OH, MY GOD. I DON'T KNOW.

36:23.710 --> 36:25.644
BUT WE HAVE TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.500
HOW?

36:28.580 --> 36:30.912
WE CAN GO THROUGH THERE.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.247
HURRY.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.916
HANNA! EMILY!

36:35.960 --> 36:37.257
HELP!

36:37.290 --> 36:38.757
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

36:39.860 --> 36:40.929
HAN NA!

36:40.960 --> 36:42.359
EMILY, PLEASE HELP!

36:42.400 --> 36:43.389
( clatter )

36:47.330 --> 36:48.558
( glass breaking )

36:48.600 --> 36:50.238
( both whispering )

36:54.280 --> 36:55.429
( door knob rattling )

36:57.940 --> 36:59.669
OHH.
OH, THANK GOD.

36:59.710 --> 37:01.917
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

37:01.950 --> 37:03.611
WHERE DID HE GO?
WE HEARD SCREAMS

37:03.650 --> 37:04.878
AND WE TRIED THE FRONT DOOR
BUT IT WAS LOCKED.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.581
YEAH, WE BROKE THE WINDOW
TO GET IN HERE.

37:06.620 --> 37:08.315
DID YOU SEE HIM?
SEE WHO?

37:08.360 --> 37:09.452
"All!
"A" WAS H ERE?

37:09.490 --> 37:11.526
YEAH. HOW DID HE GET OUT?
I DON'T KNOW.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.658
GUYS, ALI'S BOOK IS GONE.

37:15.700 --> 37:16.758
( banging on wall )

37:32.680 --> 37:34.238
HEY.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.524
YOUR FRIENDS WERE
SO QUIET IN THE CAR.

37:49.030 --> 37:51.362
IT'S BEEN A LONG NIGHT.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.823
DID YOU GUYS SEE A BEAR
OR SOMETHING?

37:53.870 --> 37:56.498
YOU GUYS LOOKED...
PRETTY FREAKED OUT.

37:56.540 --> 37:59.634
YEAH. YEAH,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

37:59.670 --> 38:03.629
UH, THERE WAS...A RACCOON
THAT GOT INTO THE CABIN

38:03.680 --> 38:05.898
AND IT WAS KIND OF LIKE
A FIGHT-TO-THE-DEATH THING.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.645
( laughs )

38:07.680 --> 38:08.942
SO, WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

38:08.980 --> 38:11.687
UH, FOR WHAT?
THE TOW.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.381
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

38:13.420 --> 38:15.684
LIKE WHAT?
LIKE I'M YOUR EMPLOYEE.

38:15.720 --> 38:19.929
I'M YOUR FRIEND.
BESIDES, I THINK I RUINED
YOUR MOM'S HAND TOWEL, SO...

38:19.960 --> 38:22.827
WELL, I GUESS
WE'RE EVEN, THEN.

38:25.100 --> 38:27.694
SERIOUSLY, I GOTTA
GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

38:27.730 --> 38:29.937
YOU DROVE ALL THAT WAY,
SO...

38:29.970 --> 38:32.530
CAN'T I JUST BE
A NICE GUY?

38:39.480 --> 38:40.947
( sighs )

39:17.050 --> 39:19.143
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
CALL YOU BACK EARLIER.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.658
I WAS IN A MEDIATION
ALL DAY.

39:21.690 --> 39:24.557
YEAH, THE MORTALI CASE.
I JUST GOT HOME.

39:26.630 --> 39:27.881
NO, SPENCER'S HERE.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.720
YEAH.

39:32.770 --> 39:35.967
WHY DON'T YOU GET SOME REST
AND I'LL TALK TO YOU
TOMORROW?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.831
LOVE YOU TOO.

39:39.170 --> 39:41.900
MOM SAYS HI.

39:41.940 --> 39:44.602
MEDIATION?

39:44.650 --> 39:46.743
LITIGATION?

39:46.780 --> 39:48.611
HOW DO YOU
KEEP IT ALL STRAIGHT?

39:48.650 --> 39:51.141
WHAT EXACTLY
WERE YOU THINKING
TALKING TO MRS. DiLAURENTIS?

39:51.180 --> 39:54.809
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT THIS FAMILY.
ONE OF US HAS TO.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.157
YOU PROMISED ME, SPENCER.

39:56.190 --> 39:59.921
I TOLD YOU NOT TO
TALK TO THAT WOMAN,
AND YOU DISOBEYED ME.

39:59.960 --> 40:03.851
NOW, YOU KEEP PUSHING IT,
AND YOU WILL BE THE ONE
TO RUIN THIS FAMILY.

40:03.900 --> 40:07.620
UNDERSTOOD?
NO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

40:07.670 --> 40:11.458
WHAT IS GOING ON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?
WHY ARE YOU LYING TO MOM?

40:11.510 --> 40:13.569
AS LONG AS YOU LIVE
UNDER MY ROOF,

40:13.610 --> 40:17.000
YOU WILL STAY AWAY FROM HER.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

40:19.680 --> 40:22.808
Ezra: SO, HOW'S HANNA DOING?
IS SHE OKAY?

40:22.850 --> 40:25.182
UM, YEAH, YEAH,
SHE WILL BE.

40:25.220 --> 40:27.848
WELL, IT'S GOOD YOU GOT
OUT OF TOWN.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.148
SO, HOW ARE YOU?

40:30.190 --> 40:32.055
DID YOU GET
ALL OF YOUR WORK DONE?

40:32.090 --> 40:34.820
YEAH, THINGS TOOK
A LITTLE LONGER
THAN I EXPECTED,

40:34.860 --> 40:37.590
BUT I...GOT EVERYTHING DONE
THAT I NEEDED TO.

40:37.630 --> 40:39.621
THAT'S GOOD.

40:39.670 --> 40:40.989
SEE YOU TOMORROW?

40:41.030 --> 40:42.736
YEAH.

40:42.770 --> 40:44.032
I LOVE YOU.

40:45.910 --> 40:48.470
I LOVE YOU TOO. BYE.

40:50.940 --> 40:52.578
( sighs )

40:55.280 --> 40:57.168
WAS THAT JAKE?

40:59.820 --> 41:02.812
IT'S NO FUN LYING TO THEM,
IS IT?

41:02.860 --> 41:04.452
NO.

41:05.990 --> 41:07.685
( knock on door)

41:09.060 --> 41:12.223
HEY.
HEY.

41:12.270 --> 41:15.967
DID YOU TALK TO YOUR DAD
ABOUT RADLEY?

41:16.000 --> 41:18.764
YEAH. I DID.

41:21.010 --> 41:23.205
MIND IF I STAY HERE
FOR A WHILE?

41:38.020 --> 41:40.056
SHE CAME IN
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

41:40.090 --> 41:42.593
SHE WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.
TO EXPLAIN.

41:42.630 --> 41:45.565
I WAS SO MAD AT HER,
AND THAT'S WHY
IT FELT SO REAL.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.591
EM, I WISH YOU WOULD
HAVE TOLD US.
I KNOW.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.565
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TRIED TO GO MEET ALI
ALL ON YOUR OWN.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.067
I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT SHE WANTED.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.998
( cell phones ring )

41:57.240 --> 41:59.640
"LOOKS LIKE I'M WINNING."

41:59.680 --> 42:00.874
"THANKS FOR THE TIP."

42:02.350 --> 42:06.138
THE JOURNAL. THE POST-ITS,
THE NOTES--

42:06.190 --> 42:09.751
WE WERE DECODING IT
STORY BY STORY.

42:09.790 --> 42:12.759
OH, MY GOD.
WE GAVE ALI TO "A."

42:15.660 --> 42:17.059
COME ON.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.234
( typing on keyboard )
