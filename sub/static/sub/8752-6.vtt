WEBVTT

00:10.060 --> 00:13.571
He murdered somebody, and
he's laughing about it.

00:13.572 --> 00:16.323
There's something here
that wants me to die.

00:16.324 --> 00:18.325
It seems like a devil.

00:18.326 --> 00:20.069
I refused to believe it.

00:20.070 --> 00:24.631
This thing is the possessor,
people worshiped it.

00:24.632 --> 00:26.533
This is the worst case I've ever heard.

00:26.534 --> 00:29.986
I just want to not be afraid anymore.

00:29.987 --> 00:32.867
It can take souls.

00:33.899 --> 00:35.688
It's really bad in here.

00:35.689 --> 00:38.329
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.647
Something is not right.

00:40.648 --> 00:41.855
I see dead people.

00:41.856 --> 00:44.045
This person might've
been a serial killer.

00:44.046 --> 00:45.830
I speak to dead people.

00:45.831 --> 00:47.598
You get those chills.

00:47.599 --> 00:49.166
And they speak to me.

00:49.167 --> 00:51.435
He is darkness, he is evil.

00:51.436 --> 00:54.485
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.486 --> 00:56.006
I think she broke her neck.

00:56.007 --> 00:57.708
I rely on my partner.

00:57.709 --> 01:01.987
I'm Steve Dischiavi, I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:01.988 --> 01:03.415
You telling me the truth?

01:03.416 --> 01:06.337
I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

01:06.338 --> 01:08.339
I think the Devil is down here.

01:08.340 --> 01:09.619
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.620 --> 01:11.073
Who the hell would do this?

01:11.074 --> 01:13.090
But Steve and I never speak.

01:13.091 --> 01:15.234
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:15.235 --> 01:16.786
Until the very end.

01:16.787 --> 01:18.096
Who's he looking to kill?

01:18.097 --> 01:20.043
Then we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:20.044 --> 01:22.186
You need to get out of here right now.

01:22.187 --> 01:23.351
Or time to get out.

01:23.352 --> 01:26.952
It was like endless darkness.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:42.303 --> 01:46.565
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

01:46.566 --> 01:51.960
I interview living witnesses, experts,
and dig through the property's dark past.

01:51.961 --> 01:56.581
While Amy communicates
with the other side.

01:57.444 --> 02:01.221
I'm in Williamsport, Pennsylvania,
heading over to see a woman named Jodi.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.275
The activity in her home is so bad,

02:03.276 --> 02:06.807
she and her husband are getting
attacked on a daily basis.

02:06.808 --> 02:09.753
She wants to sell, but he
wants to stay and fight.

02:09.755 --> 02:15.655
She says if Amy and I can't help her
out, she thinks her marriage is done for.

02:19.732 --> 02:23.078
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:23.079 --> 02:28.941
This home has a lot of family photos
that have to be covered or removed.

02:28.942 --> 02:34.842
Once they're gone, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

02:46.225 --> 02:49.261
I just see, like, a
woman off in the distance.

02:49.262 --> 02:54.002
She has very, like,
Native American features.

02:57.100 --> 03:00.318
I don't think she's well.

03:00.319 --> 03:03.619
She has a lot of anger.

03:08.881 --> 03:11.430
So this woman that I was
talking about earlier...

03:11.431 --> 03:16.362
Says that she just wanted
everyone to understand...

03:16.363 --> 03:21.500
Like, she didn't betray them or
mean to hurt anyone, but that,

03:21.501 --> 03:25.566
at the same time, they
needed to learn a lesson.

03:25.567 --> 03:29.347
She feels like they deserve it.

03:34.574 --> 03:38.762
So Jodi, I'm glad I'm here, because
things sounded pretty bad on the phone.

03:38.763 --> 03:41.163
It's rough.

03:44.217 --> 03:47.097
It's really rough.

03:47.548 --> 03:52.408
Because I feel like
nobody believes me, and...

03:53.159 --> 03:58.896
You try to tell people, and they
look at you like you're crazy.

03:58.897 --> 04:01.032
Listen, we're here to help, okay?

04:01.033 --> 04:04.162
All right? We're here to help you, so...

04:04.163 --> 04:08.173
It's gonna be okay, okay?
We're gonna see what we can do.

04:08.174 --> 04:10.454
All right?

04:10.663 --> 04:12.778
Okay, so who lives here
with you, your husband?

04:12.779 --> 04:14.780
Just me and my husband.

04:14.781 --> 04:18.728
- How long have you guys been here?
- We've lived here since 2004.

04:18.728 --> 04:20.648
I didn't even want
to live in this house.

04:20.649 --> 04:24.137
Okay, why'd you call us now, though?

04:24.138 --> 04:27.318
Because of the attacks.

04:28.084 --> 04:31.431
They are more frequent now.

04:31.432 --> 04:33.531
I'm touched every day...

04:33.532 --> 04:36.209
It's just constant.

04:36.210 --> 04:39.622
I'm hearing things
throughout the house, I...

04:39.623 --> 04:42.143
See shadows...

04:42.354 --> 04:45.170
And it's gotten...

04:45.171 --> 04:49.285
To the point where I just feel like
I'm being followed everywhere I go.

04:49.286 --> 04:51.774
I go take a shower...

04:51.775 --> 04:57.370
And it actually feels like somebody
has climbed in the shower with me.

04:57.371 --> 05:01.190
I feel like something
has attached itself to me.

05:01.191 --> 05:05.226
I worry about what's gonna happen to me.

05:05.227 --> 05:08.062
I never know what's gonna
happen from day to day.

05:08.063 --> 05:11.003
I just don't know.

05:13.841 --> 05:19.479
The Native American woman,
she follows this person around.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.968
Can you talk about the person she's...

05:21.969 --> 05:25.218
- Talking to?
- Um, living person...

05:25.219 --> 05:27.453
Seems to be a female...

05:27.454 --> 05:30.454
Um, probably about...

05:31.077 --> 05:32.815
Forties?

05:32.816 --> 05:35.370
I'm not sure what she wants from her.

05:35.371 --> 05:39.554
I just know that she is with her a lot.

05:39.555 --> 05:41.885
Because, I mean, I see them,
like, in the kitchen together,

05:41.886 --> 05:44.237
I see them showering
together, I see them...

05:44.238 --> 05:47.091
You know, her in the room at night.

05:47.092 --> 05:52.012
The dead girl is not
helping the living woman.

05:55.383 --> 05:57.451
What's going on in here?

05:57.452 --> 06:02.072
I saw an apparition
walk past the doorway.

06:02.524 --> 06:05.678
And they were wearing
blue jeans and boots.

06:05.679 --> 06:08.374
So what are we talking about, like
cowboy boots, or like work boots?

06:08.375 --> 06:10.379
They look like work boots.

06:10.380 --> 06:12.501
- Now, was it a man or a woman?
- It was a man.

06:12.502 --> 06:15.240
Okay, so have you seen
anything else like that?

06:15.241 --> 06:18.419
I've seen, like, a
dark shadow of a figure.

06:18.420 --> 06:23.468
I just see it out of the corner of my
eye, and it's like you turn, and it's gone.

06:23.469 --> 06:26.534
Now, let me ask you a question, what
do you think is going on in this house?

06:26.535 --> 06:29.608
I feel like there's
something here that...

06:29.609 --> 06:32.369
Wants me to die.

06:34.359 --> 06:37.119
The thing that I'm seeing
looks like what's depicted

06:37.120 --> 06:41.232
in the Catholic religion as a devil.

06:41.233 --> 06:46.304
To me, it looks like it has
long nails, and evil and [Bleep].

06:46.305 --> 06:50.909
It's saying that it can take
as many souls as it likes.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.728
Like, I'm like, "what are you?"
And he's like, "I am the darkness".

06:53.729 --> 06:56.348
How would people experience him?

06:56.349 --> 06:59.581
It's solid, she's definitely seen it.

06:59.582 --> 07:01.881
Can it hurt people?

07:01.882 --> 07:04.468
It's saying it can and it will.

07:04.469 --> 07:09.809
It's a trickster, it's a
liar, it's a manipulator.

07:17.436 --> 07:22.507
So, Jodi, why'd you bring me in
the basement, what's going on here?

07:22.508 --> 07:27.180
I've seen an apparition of
an Indian sitting right there.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.989
Talking about like a
Native American Indian?

07:28.990 --> 07:32.817
Yes. It looked like he was
dressed, like, ready for war.

07:32.818 --> 07:35.271
Okay, are you experiencing
anything else down here?

07:35.272 --> 07:38.185
Um, yeah, I hear...

07:38.186 --> 07:40.561
What sounds like...

07:40.562 --> 07:42.388
Hammers...

07:42.389 --> 07:44.619
Boards being moved.

07:44.620 --> 07:48.637
I want to describe it as almost
like somebody working on the house.

07:48.638 --> 07:52.103
You have that feeling of uneasiness down
here, I can see it just looking at you.

07:52.104 --> 07:55.097
Yeah, I... don't even
want to be here right now.

07:55.098 --> 07:57.089
Okay, all right, so why
don't we get out of here?

07:57.090 --> 08:01.830
You've spent enough
time down here with me.

08:01.881 --> 08:05.701
One of the things it likes to do is...

08:05.702 --> 08:07.532
That.

08:07.533 --> 08:11.154
Yeah, [Bleep] Around with the doors.

08:11.155 --> 08:15.295
I think this thing is the possessor.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.308
The thing says that, you
know, people worshiped it.

08:19.309 --> 08:22.177
The Native Americans, they
would allow it inside of them

08:22.178 --> 08:27.878
to do things because that
was the way to keep the peace.

08:30.142 --> 08:35.782
I think it would oftentimes
kill the person it possessed.

08:41.318 --> 08:44.126
Okay, Jodi, so what's going on up here?

08:44.128 --> 08:49.198
As soon as I turn my light off to try
to close my eyes and go to sleep...

08:49.199 --> 08:52.078
That's when it gets worse.

08:52.079 --> 08:55.434
Are you getting
physically touched up here?

08:55.435 --> 08:59.036
I've had some stuff
happen to me up here.

08:59.037 --> 09:02.294
Like, almost like somebody's...

09:02.295 --> 09:06.129
Trying to wake me up in
an arousal kind of way.

09:06.130 --> 09:07.514
Okay.

09:07.515 --> 09:13.415
And you toss, you turn, you move, you...
you know, you say, "get away from me"...

09:13.739 --> 09:18.857
And before you know it, something
is over me that you can't see.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.858
- Okay.
- And I was, um...

09:21.859 --> 09:24.019
Attacked.

09:24.436 --> 09:26.155
Sexually.

09:26.156 --> 09:28.142
Have you told anybody this?

09:28.143 --> 09:33.634
I tried to tell my husband about it,
and I don't feel like he believes...

09:33.635 --> 09:35.936
What happened to me.

09:35.937 --> 09:40.317
Um, it's just real hard to talk about.

09:42.113 --> 09:46.362
I imagine that's gotta be the most horrific
thing for a woman to have to deal with.

09:46.363 --> 09:50.488
When I was a young girl,
I was sexually assaulted.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.489
How old were you when this happened?

09:52.490 --> 09:56.330
Um... I was about 12 years old.

09:56.427 --> 09:59.246
Okay, look at me, okay?

09:59.247 --> 10:05.147
So you can trust me, alright I'm listening
to everything you're telling me, okay?

10:05.419 --> 10:09.266
I just want it to end,
I just want to not...

10:09.267 --> 10:12.210
Be afraid in my own house anymore.

10:12.211 --> 10:16.959
It's so hard, because I spend so
much time in this house, alone.

10:16.960 --> 10:20.385
I'm gonna make this okay, all
right? Come here, I promise.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.996
I'm gonna make this right,
we're gonna figure it out, okay?

10:22.997 --> 10:26.957
- Mm hm.
- Don't worry about it.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.849
I think it can do vile things.

10:31.850 --> 10:34.632
- Like what?
- Inappropriate...

10:34.633 --> 10:37.104
Sexual things, sometimes.

10:37.105 --> 10:41.850
And it's very traumatizing and
scary for this person, as I...

10:41.851 --> 10:44.131
Understand.

10:50.282 --> 10:52.781
I hear somebody in this room, a female.

10:52.782 --> 10:56.819
She's mad, she's very
angry, she feels attacked.

10:56.820 --> 11:00.965
She's being messed with
by the... uh, the thing.

11:00.966 --> 11:03.530
It's found her secrets, and it's like...

11:03.531 --> 11:07.043
Messing with her mind through
her secrets or something.

11:07.044 --> 11:11.686
And she's like, can't take
it anymore, she's like...

11:11.687 --> 11:14.317
She's very stressed out.

11:14.318 --> 11:16.738
I feel like it's saying, like,
"you know I'm a part of you,

11:16.739 --> 11:22.079
you know you're a part
of me, I'm gonna get you".

11:30.916 --> 11:34.216
She's very stressed out.

11:35.387 --> 11:37.848
I feel like it's saying, like,
"you know I'm a part of you,

11:37.849 --> 11:43.189
you know you're a part
of me, I'm gonna get you".

11:44.175 --> 11:47.825
So it's mentally abusing her, I guess.

11:47.826 --> 11:51.366
Is this thing targeting her?

11:51.388 --> 11:53.788
Yes, it is.

12:00.291 --> 12:03.226
Patrick, let me ask you a question,
do you know any history of the house?

12:03.227 --> 12:07.413
A little bit, I did read
a few things about some...

12:07.414 --> 12:10.897
The American Indians in this area.

12:10.898 --> 12:14.581
There was a lot of fighting
with other tribes in this...

12:14.582 --> 12:17.069
This particular valley.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.211
- So Patrick, I talked to your wife, Jodi.
- Mm.

12:20.212 --> 12:25.252
And I've done a lot of
these cases, and she...

12:25.747 --> 12:27.859
She's having a tough time here.

12:27.860 --> 12:30.682
I mean, at first, I really...

12:30.683 --> 12:34.511
Didn't believe any of it,
I refused to believe it.

12:34.512 --> 12:36.282
Are you still refusing to believe it?

12:36.283 --> 12:38.803
Um, I can't.

12:39.153 --> 12:40.830
What do you mean you can't?

12:40.831 --> 12:45.977
Me and Jodi was in the
living room talking, and...

12:45.978 --> 12:47.927
We decided to turn the TV off.

12:47.928 --> 12:50.616
So when I turned it off...

12:50.617 --> 12:55.537
I saw a man sitting on
the arm of her chair.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.072
And I told her, I said,
"Jodi, do you see this?"

12:58.073 --> 13:00.354
She says, "what?" I
said, "look in the TV".

13:00.355 --> 13:02.653
And I looked over at her, and
I looked back, it was gone.

13:02.654 --> 13:04.568
There was nothing there,
just her reflection.

13:04.569 --> 13:06.570
What'd he look like?

13:06.571 --> 13:09.340
He had... I want to
call it a farmer's hat.

13:09.341 --> 13:11.764
It looked like he had a beard.

13:11.765 --> 13:15.776
He looked angry, and it scared me.

13:15.777 --> 13:18.802
So what you're telling me is that
you're not a skeptic of what's

13:18.803 --> 13:21.289
going on, you believe there's
something going on in your house.

13:21.290 --> 13:23.221
Yeah, I know there's
something going on here.

13:23.222 --> 13:25.326
But yet at the same time,
your wife seems to think

13:25.327 --> 13:27.225
you're not believing
anything she's telling you.

13:27.226 --> 13:29.522
- When Jodi was attacked...
- Right.

13:29.523 --> 13:32.106
And I came home...

13:32.107 --> 13:34.387
She was...

13:35.003 --> 13:36.635
In, I would say, a state of shock,

13:36.636 --> 13:40.579
I mean, she was just white as a ghost,
she was trembling, she was upset.

13:40.580 --> 13:44.708
Well, I went off, and
I called 'em all out.

13:44.709 --> 13:48.312
I said, "look, if you're this bad
and you're this tough, show yourself".

13:48.313 --> 13:49.750
Okay, so what happened?

13:49.751 --> 13:54.251
I woke up with bruises on my lower back.

14:02.093 --> 14:05.662
And I can't figure out what he is.

14:05.663 --> 14:11.563
It seems like he keeps that form,
like, that look of, like, a devil.

14:13.471 --> 14:18.091
He also likes to make
people feel trapped.

14:35.259 --> 14:37.327
I don't know, like, he's up in the...

14:37.328 --> 14:39.548
Up, up...

14:43.167 --> 14:47.121
He's saying, like, he
murdered somebody or something.

14:47.122 --> 14:50.662
And he's laughing about it.

14:52.176 --> 14:54.945
My main concern right now is my wife.

14:54.946 --> 14:58.182
She sobbed when I
spoke with her, sobbed.

14:58.183 --> 15:01.741
I can't give her answers,
and she keeps asking me,

15:01.742 --> 15:04.744
and, you know, when I can't
answer, what do you do?

15:04.745 --> 15:09.050
- Right.
- That's why I spend so much time out here.

15:09.051 --> 15:11.709
It's breaking my heart,
the both of you, I mean,

15:11.710 --> 15:14.416
it sounds like you two
aren't communicating.

15:14.417 --> 15:16.901
You want to help, you
just don't know how.

15:16.902 --> 15:22.063
It's went downhill, it's went
downhill fast, faster than we want.

15:22.064 --> 15:24.671
But we don't know what to do to fix it.

15:24.672 --> 15:26.907
She's concerned that the
house is gonna kill her.

15:26.908 --> 15:28.768
Wow.

15:29.966 --> 15:33.950
She's been attacked, and attacked in
ways that nobody should be attacked.

15:33.951 --> 15:38.155
I think it wants... whatever
it is wants to hurt her again.

15:38.156 --> 15:40.081
Like I said, I'm not...

15:40.082 --> 15:44.861
I don't want to say dead, because I
don't want to see that happen, but...

15:44.862 --> 15:50.762
This is the worst case I've ever
heard as far as paranormal stuff.

15:50.954 --> 15:53.670
- Can we take a break?
- Yeah, absolutely.

15:53.671 --> 15:57.511
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

16:35.507 --> 16:39.192
Patrick told me there were some violent
Native American wars on his property.

16:39.193 --> 16:42.094
Now, most times client leads
turn out to be a dead end,

16:42.095 --> 16:44.389
but this one I want to check out.

16:44.390 --> 16:46.248
I've reached out to a
local historian to see

16:46.249 --> 16:50.929
if there's any truth
to what Patrick said.

16:54.793 --> 16:59.776
So my client told me that the land
I'm investigating, where his house is,

16:59.777 --> 17:02.636
at one time there was warring
Native Americans, is that correct?

17:02.637 --> 17:04.351
That's correct.

17:04.352 --> 17:08.067
There was a treaty signed in 1768.

17:08.068 --> 17:13.269
And that delineated Native American
property from white settler property.

17:13.270 --> 17:17.780
But the white settlers didn't
always obey those guidelines,

17:17.781 --> 17:21.441
and so they were squatting
on Native American property.

17:21.442 --> 17:24.357
And that includes the
property I'm investigating?

17:24.358 --> 17:26.023
- That's right.
- Okay.

17:26.025 --> 17:29.159
Well, the Senecas went on a rampage.

17:29.160 --> 17:33.862
In part because the British had
prompted them, they had given them guns,

17:33.863 --> 17:36.083
they had given them ammunition.

17:36.084 --> 17:40.038
And the Native Americans
began these attacks to

17:40.039 --> 17:45.421
antagonize the white settlers
to move them off the property.

17:45.422 --> 17:48.128
How many white settlers did get
killed during these conflicts?

17:48.129 --> 17:50.993
There are at least 370 documented.

17:50.994 --> 17:52.638
Now who was in charge of these guys?

17:52.639 --> 17:56.659
They were led by Chief Cornplanter.

17:56.828 --> 17:59.233
He was a very peaceful man.

17:59.234 --> 18:02.236
He didn't sound so peaceful
after what you just told me.

18:02.237 --> 18:05.541
I think, perhaps, he
was a reluctant warrior.

18:05.542 --> 18:09.569
He loved his nation, he
loved his tribe, and so...

18:09.570 --> 18:15.470
He decided to go along, of course, with
the majority, and the majority ruled.

18:21.821 --> 18:24.322
So now I'm seeing this guy.

18:24.323 --> 18:26.153
I think it's a Native American.

18:26.154 --> 18:28.074
Um...

18:28.627 --> 18:32.227
He has feathers in his hair.

18:33.010 --> 18:36.310
I think he feels guilty.

18:40.572 --> 18:46.243
There's only so much that you want
to see your enemies fall to revenge.

18:46.244 --> 18:50.175
I think he thinks he
needs to make things right.

18:50.176 --> 18:52.656
This Native American knows
all about the Devil creature

18:52.657 --> 18:54.535
I've been seeing throughout the house.

18:54.536 --> 18:57.826
And he's telling me his people
had to deal with it, too.

18:57.827 --> 19:02.093
He's saying people
worshiped it, and, um...

19:02.094 --> 19:04.794
But not anymore.

19:05.997 --> 19:10.723
You know, you have to
do things for this devil.

19:10.724 --> 19:15.344
Otherwise, it will do
uncontrollable things.

19:16.474 --> 19:19.142
Now let me ask you a question about
the property I'm investigating.

19:19.143 --> 19:22.612
Any of those attacks
happen right on my property?

19:22.613 --> 19:26.225
- Well, June 10, 1778...
- Okay.

19:26.226 --> 19:30.360
The Plum Tree Massacre, as
it's widely known, occurred.

19:30.361 --> 19:32.256
Okay, what happened?

19:32.257 --> 19:35.813
There was a wagon-load of 16 settlers,

19:35.814 --> 19:39.411
and there were Native
Americans of the Seneca tribe.

19:39.412 --> 19:43.490
They were concealed in
a group of plum trees.

19:43.491 --> 19:48.307
And so when the wagon passed through,
the Native Americans attacked.

19:48.308 --> 19:51.909
So 16 settlers go through, and they
get ambushed, were they all killed?

19:51.910 --> 19:55.655
Twelve were massacred... there
were two children who were killed.

19:55.656 --> 20:00.453
Two of the people were women, they
were both scalped and stabbed...

20:00.454 --> 20:03.809
Tomahawked, and left for dead.

20:03.810 --> 20:06.708
And two of the girls were kidnapped.

20:06.709 --> 20:08.176
Do you know what happened to them?

20:08.177 --> 20:10.864
I know that they were taken to Canada.

20:10.865 --> 20:13.567
I don't know the rest of the story.

20:13.568 --> 20:15.488
Okay.

20:19.072 --> 20:22.141
I'm hearing a lot of...

20:22.142 --> 20:24.722
Gunfire nearby.

20:25.536 --> 20:28.200
And this man, he's hiding.

20:28.201 --> 20:31.967
He's crouched down, and
he's, like, shivering.

20:31.968 --> 20:35.748
And he's hearing all of the...

20:35.878 --> 20:39.238
The fighting and gunshots.

20:42.095 --> 20:45.864
It was unexpected... whatever
happened was completely unexpected.

20:45.865 --> 20:51.203
Women are screaming and running,
people are running all over the place.

20:51.204 --> 20:56.030
Men are yelling at each other and
shooting each other and shooting people...

20:56.031 --> 21:00.351
Somebody's yelling about the apocalypse.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.945
I definitely want to follow
up on what happened to the

21:18.946 --> 21:21.477
two young girls kidnapped
on my client's property.

21:21.478 --> 21:23.287
I'm heading over to
meet with a local author

21:23.288 --> 21:28.208
who says the story had
a very dramatic ending.

21:35.151 --> 21:38.498
So I understand there was this Plum Tree
Massacre on the property I'm investigating

21:38.499 --> 21:40.520
and that two young girls
were actually kidnapped

21:40.521 --> 21:42.964
by the Native Americans
that did that massacre.

21:42.965 --> 21:44.426
What can you tell me about that?

21:44.427 --> 21:49.053
The two girls' names were Ruth
and Sarah King, age 2 and 4.

21:49.054 --> 21:52.484
Their father's name was William
King, he was a member of the militia,

21:52.485 --> 21:56.899
the colonial militia, and he was out of
the area when the massacre took place.

21:56.900 --> 22:02.404
But the mother, Rachel, was gruesomely
killed in front of her two daughters.

22:02.405 --> 22:05.577
But, for some reason,
these girls were spared

22:05.578 --> 22:09.235
and taken up the
Sheshequin Trail to Canada.

22:09.236 --> 22:12.206
- Okay.
- The younger child, Ruth...

22:12.207 --> 22:17.798
Was sold to the wife of a British officer
who apparently couldn't have children.

22:17.799 --> 22:20.779
And we don't know for sure what
happened to her sister Sarah,

22:20.780 --> 22:23.581
but she did survive, and
she was in the area there.

22:23.582 --> 22:26.571
Okay, so now, William King comes back

22:26.572 --> 22:29.547
and found out his wife was murdered
and his two kids were missing.

22:29.548 --> 22:32.188
That's correct.

22:33.007 --> 22:35.611
There's this man...

22:35.612 --> 22:37.689
I feel like he's alone.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.980
I think maybe his wife is dead.

22:40.981 --> 22:45.421
Uh, and maybe his children are far away.

22:45.469 --> 22:49.517
There's also, like, a
woman off in the distance.

22:49.518 --> 22:53.718
Like, I kinda get "escapee" with her.

22:54.323 --> 22:57.367
She has a lot of anger.

22:57.368 --> 23:00.353
Definitely a lost soul, that's for sure.

23:00.354 --> 23:02.487
So what happened with the kids?

23:02.488 --> 23:06.351
Well, their father never totally
gave up hope that he'd find them.

23:06.352 --> 23:09.516
And seven years after
the massacre happened he,

23:09.517 --> 23:12.500
found out where they were, and
so he set out to retrieve them.

23:12.501 --> 23:16.868
He found an Indian guide to take
him north towards Fort Niagara.

23:16.869 --> 23:17.809
Okay.

23:17.810 --> 23:20.201
Somehow, he recovers the two children

23:20.202 --> 23:23.334
and brings them back down
to the Williamsport area.

23:23.335 --> 23:26.126
And led what appeared to
be a fairly normal life.

23:26.127 --> 23:31.060
'Til, in 1802, he had an accident
on the river, a creek, he fell in,

23:31.061 --> 23:35.305
got paralyzed, and it lingered
for several days, and died.

23:35.306 --> 23:38.846
- Huh.
- At the age of 57.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.191
I'm heading to the local library to find

23:42.192 --> 23:45.897
anything else I can about
my client's property.

23:45.898 --> 23:48.948
Searching through the archives...

23:48.949 --> 23:53.233
I discovered the Lord family
lived there for generations.

23:53.234 --> 23:57.656
Turns out, a lot of the family
members died on my client's land.

23:57.657 --> 23:59.578
But a local genealogist tells me

23:59.579 --> 24:04.919
a couple of those deaths
might help my investigation.

24:11.605 --> 24:16.278
Now, the Lord family owned the property
I'm investigating for a pretty long time.

24:16.279 --> 24:20.719
Yes, nearly 80 years, from 1882 to 1961.

24:20.929 --> 24:25.369
Now, of all the deaths on this property,
you said a couple of them are unusual.

24:25.370 --> 24:29.662
Oh, yes, there were two sisters.
The first was Sarah Bricker...

24:29.663 --> 24:33.055
She lived in the house
out back of the property.

24:33.056 --> 24:38.615
And, in 1903, she came over
to visit her sister next door.

24:38.616 --> 24:41.609
- Okay.
- And just fell over dead.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.747
From what?

24:42.748 --> 24:47.570
What we would now say is
stroke or a cerebral hemorrhage.

24:47.571 --> 24:50.996
Okay, so Sarah was 40 years old,
which was young, even for back then.

24:50.997 --> 24:52.559
Yes.

24:52.560 --> 24:56.746
Then, ten years later,
her sister, Amanda Lord,

24:56.747 --> 24:59.371
passes away suddenly of the same thing.

24:59.372 --> 25:01.162
Wow.

25:01.163 --> 25:05.634
Okay, so ten years apart, two
sisters die from the same illness...

25:05.635 --> 25:08.691
- On the same property.
- Yes.

25:08.692 --> 25:11.392
That is unusual.

25:18.569 --> 25:21.138
It's a sickness here.

25:21.139 --> 25:23.187
Someone died in this room.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.948
Very ill, female.

25:27.078 --> 25:29.839
This woman, she crawls...

25:29.840 --> 25:33.620
Into the ceiling and disappears.

25:36.231 --> 25:41.331
So she doesn't have any
interaction with anybody.

25:41.803 --> 25:46.074
Her pain is still
something that is here.

25:46.075 --> 25:48.955
In a physical way.

25:49.502 --> 25:54.722
She's like, "oh, you know,
bad, bad, it was bad".

26:00.790 --> 26:03.941
There were several entities
that stood out during my walk.

26:03.942 --> 26:05.977
But what has me the most concerned

26:05.978 --> 26:09.995
is the Devil creature that's
tormenting a living woman.

26:09.996 --> 26:14.316
This thing was coming out of a closet.

26:16.838 --> 26:22.418
And it was pitch black, but
its skin was, like, glossy.

26:23.912 --> 26:28.832
And there was a woman
who was yelling at him.

26:31.619 --> 26:34.739
Is this what you saw?

26:35.224 --> 26:37.084
Yes.

27:00.314 --> 27:03.305
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations...

27:03.306 --> 27:08.345
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

27:08.346 --> 27:11.697
Well, Amy, I gotta tell ya,
this is probably one of the

27:11.698 --> 27:14.834
hardest cases I've ever worked on.

27:14.835 --> 27:17.464
I want to introduce
you to Jodi and Patrick.

27:17.465 --> 27:19.165
They're a married couple that live here.

27:19.166 --> 27:21.902
Listening to their stories was
pretty gut-wrenching for me.

27:21.903 --> 27:26.431
Bottom line, Jodi thinks there's something
in this house that's trying to kill them.

27:26.432 --> 27:28.775
And kill her specifically.

27:28.776 --> 27:31.623
It's tearing their marriage apart.

27:31.624 --> 27:35.100
They called us in because we're their
last hope so, with that being said,

27:35.101 --> 27:40.981
I'm gonna ask Amy to tell us
a little bit about her walk.

27:43.398 --> 27:48.738
I'm definitely aware that there's
a lot of issues here, and, um...

27:48.739 --> 27:53.032
We'll get into everything
slowly but surely.

27:53.033 --> 27:56.813
I went to the back yard, and...

27:56.814 --> 27:59.187
I saw a lot of...

27:59.188 --> 28:03.801
Really odd, like, violent
and chaotic images.

28:03.802 --> 28:05.824
I was hearing gunfire.

28:05.825 --> 28:09.075
It wasn't just men, you
know, I heard women screaming.

28:09.076 --> 28:12.309
I think I saw a woman get shot.

28:12.310 --> 28:16.658
Whatever was happening had
just come out of nowhere.

28:16.659 --> 28:18.868
A lot of what you're saying
is something I uncovered

28:18.869 --> 28:21.612
and that you had pointed
me in the direction of.

28:21.613 --> 28:24.266
You gotta know something about
this property we're on, Amy.

28:24.267 --> 28:28.707
It was the scene of fierce battles of...

28:28.808 --> 28:32.702
Native Americans against white settlers.

28:32.703 --> 28:36.601
On June 10 in 1778,
right on this property...

28:36.602 --> 28:39.029
There was an event called
the Plum Tree Massacre.

28:39.030 --> 28:41.884
And when that massacre
was over, men, women,

28:41.885 --> 28:47.585
and children were murdered,
all shot, stabbed, and scalped.

28:47.834 --> 28:50.030
Where did the Native Americans live?

28:50.031 --> 28:51.546
Here, this is their land.

28:51.547 --> 28:56.341
White settlers were breaking
a treaty that was set in 1768.

28:56.342 --> 29:00.637
Well, a lot of other stuff I got
is totally making sense now, so...

29:00.638 --> 29:02.558
Okay.

29:03.765 --> 29:06.482
At one point, I went
into the basement, and,

29:06.483 --> 29:10.563
I encountered a Native American man.

29:10.570 --> 29:14.230
He said that he feels guilty.

29:15.015 --> 29:18.458
And he feels like, you
know, you can only want

29:18.459 --> 29:22.239
so much agony for your enemies.

29:22.241 --> 29:25.746
Now, Jodi, you saw a Native American
man in the basement, as well, right?

29:25.747 --> 29:28.384
- Yes.
- Describe that for Amy for me.

29:28.385 --> 29:31.484
He was sitting... what looked
like he was sitting on top

29:31.485 --> 29:34.861
of the pipe in the back
room of the basement.

29:34.862 --> 29:38.525
The brown pants, um, I
could see the white feathers.

29:38.526 --> 29:44.426
I turned to walk away and turned
back around, and he was gone.

29:45.466 --> 29:50.283
Who I think both of you might
have encountered is, um...

29:50.284 --> 29:52.781
This guy Chief Cornplanter.

29:52.782 --> 29:55.703
He was the war Chief
for the Seneca tribe.

29:55.704 --> 29:57.572
This is a portrait.

29:57.573 --> 30:00.997
Cornplanter is his
Indian name translated.

30:00.998 --> 30:02.858
Wow.

30:03.958 --> 30:06.050
He was considered a peaceful man.

30:06.051 --> 30:08.955
He didn't want to be part
of any kind of fighting.

30:08.956 --> 30:13.722
But after his tribe made a treaty with the
British Army, he became a violent killer.

30:13.723 --> 30:19.623
He's responsible for killing at least
370 men, women, and children in this area.

30:20.889 --> 30:24.323
Even though he was a peaceful man, he
turned into one of the bloodiest killers...

30:24.324 --> 30:29.013
- Which makes sense.
- So, is this who you think you saw?

30:29.014 --> 30:33.694
- I think it could be, yes, I do.
- Okay.

30:35.088 --> 30:39.203
I also ran into a Native American woman.

30:39.204 --> 30:41.411
Unfortunately, the other
thing I got was that

30:41.412 --> 30:44.739
she actually had
attached herself to you.

30:44.740 --> 30:48.557
Like, I literally kinda saw
her, like, holding your arm.

30:48.558 --> 30:51.206
She even, like, goes
into the bath with you.

30:51.207 --> 30:56.362
Like, she just doesn't really leave you
alone, she's always kind of by your side.

30:56.363 --> 31:02.263
And I would think that you would feel
her presence, because she's always on you.

31:03.411 --> 31:07.851
Everywhere I go in this house, I feel...

31:07.864 --> 31:12.563
It feels like somebody else's
energy around me, constantly.

31:12.564 --> 31:18.267
Anywhere I sit, it just feels like
somebody is with me, sharing my body.

31:18.268 --> 31:21.923
It's just everywhere I
go. I go to bed at night...

31:21.924 --> 31:24.454
Somebody's there.

31:24.455 --> 31:27.152
I'm just not ever alone.

31:27.153 --> 31:32.137
I tried to tell my family
what was going on in my house,

31:32.138 --> 31:35.678
and they all laughed at me.

31:35.682 --> 31:38.048
And ridiculed me.

31:38.049 --> 31:43.949
I don't go to family functions, because I
know what they say about me behind my back.

31:44.308 --> 31:48.632
Plus she doesn't think that Patrick
actually believes anything she says.

31:48.633 --> 31:51.637
I understand people who
are skeptics because,

31:51.638 --> 31:55.116
I think that when they
lash out like that, it's...

31:55.117 --> 31:58.231
Based out of fear and ignorance.

31:58.232 --> 32:03.152
I've gotta see things
in order to believe it.

32:03.664 --> 32:07.711
It's been a tremendous
strain on our family.

32:07.712 --> 32:12.347
It's been almost three years that
we've been putting up with this, the...

32:12.348 --> 32:14.371
The ridicule.

32:14.372 --> 32:17.850
But this is your wife and
your partner in your life.

32:17.851 --> 32:21.237
You need to stand by her side and...

32:21.238 --> 32:25.918
Screw the people who
are calling her names.

32:26.371 --> 32:29.962
I get so angry, because he goes...

32:29.963 --> 32:32.563
He goes and he leaves me sitting here.

32:32.564 --> 32:35.909
Knowin' how they feel about me.

32:35.910 --> 32:40.230
And it's very hard to sit here alone.

32:40.544 --> 32:43.319
And I can't do anything with them.

32:43.320 --> 32:47.580
Because, because they think I'm crazy.

32:48.415 --> 32:52.065
You see right now, I mean,
it's tearing me up right now.

32:52.066 --> 32:55.486
Because she's so tore up.

32:56.983 --> 32:59.484
I know this has been a
pretty tough night already,

32:59.485 --> 33:01.759
but I think, Amy, you have more stuff?

33:01.760 --> 33:06.560
I also came into contact
with another entity.

33:07.568 --> 33:09.488
It...

33:09.793 --> 33:15.296
Showed itself to me at one point
to look like a traditional...

33:15.297 --> 33:18.597
Out-of-the-Bible devil.

33:18.657 --> 33:23.817
The truer self of it was,
like, this very tall...

33:24.682 --> 33:28.343
Um, completely black but
with, like, shiny skin.

33:28.344 --> 33:31.964
And it had long, like,
fingers and nails.

33:31.965 --> 33:34.776
And little horns, and, um...

33:34.777 --> 33:37.342
It can show itself in different ways.

33:37.343 --> 33:41.981
A Native American female
told me that this...

33:41.982 --> 33:46.602
Thing had been here
for a very long time.

33:47.598 --> 33:50.076
How would they see it is
what I'm curious about?

33:50.077 --> 33:54.080
I would think some kind of blackness.

33:54.081 --> 33:59.981
I see a lot of dark figure
shadows moving through the kitchen.

34:00.381 --> 34:03.981
And a lot up in my bedroom.

34:04.242 --> 34:07.661
It seemed to me that
he was focusing on you.

34:07.662 --> 34:13.266
He had found whatever weakness
he perceives from you, about you.

34:13.268 --> 34:17.228
He was psychologically abusing you.

34:17.362 --> 34:23.263
He was grabbing and licking you and
doing inappropriate sexual things to you.

34:24.339 --> 34:29.619
I was sexually assaulted
several times in the house.

34:30.853 --> 34:35.806
I've been traumatized and basically
terrorized for three years.

34:35.806 --> 34:41.543
I feel something standing over
me when I'm in my bed, and...

34:41.545 --> 34:43.945
I'm scared.

34:47.596 --> 34:50.239
How you doing over there?

34:50.241 --> 34:53.996
The day that she was
attacked, that I came home...

34:53.996 --> 34:58.084
I went through this house, screaming.

34:58.085 --> 35:01.364
And I called whatever it was...

35:01.365 --> 35:04.319
"You want something to
deal with, come get me".

35:04.320 --> 35:07.980
And I woke up with bruises...

35:08.399 --> 35:10.799
On my back.

35:10.869 --> 35:13.482
That's one of the things I can't...

35:13.483 --> 35:15.523
Debunk.

35:17.589 --> 35:23.489
It's hard for me to be intimate
with my own husband because...

35:24.320 --> 35:27.560
Of what happened to me.

35:29.090 --> 35:33.349
She shared with me, when she was
younger, much younger, she was...

35:33.350 --> 35:37.820
- I was gonna ask, right.
- Sexually assaulted by a family member.

35:37.821 --> 35:43.161
- She doesn't have a support system.
- She does now.

35:45.412 --> 35:50.764
I did do a sketch of what I saw
upstairs in your room, and...

35:50.765 --> 35:54.665
It seemed to be that you were...

35:54.889 --> 35:59.329
Very angry and stressed out at the time.

36:03.614 --> 36:06.014
Oh,.

36:25.527 --> 36:28.947
I just want my life back.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.306
Jodi, come here.

36:51.407 --> 36:56.975
I did do a sketch of what I saw
upstairs in your room, and...

36:56.976 --> 37:00.876
It seemed to be that you were...

37:01.528 --> 37:05.968
Very angry and stressed out at the time.

37:09.931 --> 37:12.331
Oh,.

37:34.600 --> 37:38.020
I just want my life back.

37:45.745 --> 37:49.225
Come here, Jodi, come here.

37:51.161 --> 37:53.819
Put your arms around me, Jodi, please.

37:57.224 --> 38:00.025
Nobody believed me.

38:00.026 --> 38:03.055
Who cares? [Bleep] 'Em.

38:06.566 --> 38:08.996
Look at me...

38:08.997 --> 38:12.897
We will take care of this, okay?

38:13.974 --> 38:16.374
I love you.

38:24.818 --> 38:27.038
You okay?

38:29.328 --> 38:32.059
What is this thing?

38:32.060 --> 38:34.883
This thing says that...

38:34.884 --> 38:38.304
It has taken souls before.

38:39.364 --> 38:43.984
It says that it has
and will hurt people.

38:45.737 --> 38:49.242
And it stated, you know
that he's a part of you

38:49.243 --> 38:53.070
and you're a part of him and
that he's going to get you.

38:53.071 --> 38:57.034
He was also trying to project bad images

38:57.035 --> 39:00.389
or dreams or something to you
to try to make you hurt yourself.

39:00.390 --> 39:05.856
And that's part of the
manipulation that he was doing.

39:05.857 --> 39:09.708
Now listen, Jodi, Patrick,
this has gotta be...

39:09.709 --> 39:13.281
One of the most extremely emotional
nights you've ever been through.

39:13.282 --> 39:17.412
I know it has been for me when
it comes to working these cases.

39:17.413 --> 39:20.271
But Jodi, now you know you're not crazy,

39:20.272 --> 39:23.104
and you're actually in a fight
against something that's real.

39:23.105 --> 39:27.445
Now, the big question, is there anything
you can do about it? And can you live a...

39:27.446 --> 39:31.775
Normal life and get your
marriage back on track?

39:31.776 --> 39:36.897
For that, I'm gonna turn it over
to Amy and see what she has to say.

39:36.898 --> 39:39.275
After the walk...

39:39.276 --> 39:41.492
I did some research.

39:41.493 --> 39:45.426
Because I came into contact
with so many Native Americans...

39:45.427 --> 39:49.562
I wanted to see if there
was anything in their history

39:49.563 --> 39:54.104
that would clarify
maybe what this could be.

39:54.105 --> 39:57.152
What I came across was...

39:57.153 --> 40:02.069
Something that tribes
referred to as the clown...

40:02.070 --> 40:05.430
The trickster, and heyoka.

40:06.421 --> 40:08.700
It was a human.

40:08.701 --> 40:14.401
But they also felt that it
was half man and half spirit.

40:14.867 --> 40:19.127
It's very possible that this entity...

40:19.191 --> 40:21.830
Was a human being.

40:21.831 --> 40:25.907
At one point and was part of a tribe.

40:25.908 --> 40:31.068
And when he died, he
became the embodiment of it.

40:31.207 --> 40:32.967
So how do they get rid of this thing?

40:32.968 --> 40:37.728
First thing is, you should contact
your local Native American tribe.

40:37.729 --> 40:40.183
That would be the Seneca
tribe for this area.

40:40.184 --> 40:44.249
And you want to connect with the Shaman.

40:44.250 --> 40:46.887
Let them know everything
that's been going on,

40:46.888 --> 40:51.699
and then allow them to do whatever
ceremony they think is necessary.

40:51.700 --> 40:57.292
Being raised Catholic and listening
to everything and seeing what I saw...

40:57.293 --> 41:00.421
Part of me wants to still...

41:00.422 --> 41:04.037
Follow the train of thought
that this is some type of demon.

41:04.038 --> 41:09.130
The next day, I would like you
to have someone from your church

41:09.131 --> 41:13.969
come to your home and perform
an exorcism of the house.

41:13.970 --> 41:16.662
What about this woman that's attached
to her, what happens with her?

41:16.663 --> 41:20.923
As you start doing an exorcism this...

41:21.134 --> 41:24.801
Native American male will remove her.

41:24.802 --> 41:27.538
I don't think I have to ask you
if you're gonna take Amy's advice.

41:27.539 --> 41:30.421
I'm definitely gonna do
everything she told me to do.

41:30.422 --> 41:32.836
I just want this gone, I want...

41:32.837 --> 41:35.985
I want to be able to
live in my home in peace

41:35.986 --> 41:40.835
and not have to worry about this
when I lay my head down at night.

41:40.836 --> 41:44.976
I can't say I'm a skeptic anymore.

41:48.919 --> 41:51.699
I'm not sure whether it will
be the Shaman or the exorcism

41:51.700 --> 41:54.318
that will get rid of
these evil entities.

41:54.319 --> 41:57.912
But if they follow my advice
and perform these two rituals...

41:57.913 --> 42:03.813
Jodi and Patrick will finally be
free and able to live in peace again.
