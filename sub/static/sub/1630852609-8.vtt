WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.270
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend Race.

00:03.270 --> 00:04.805
I feel very attacked!

00:04.805 --> 00:07.875
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.577
Oh, my God.

00:10.577 --> 00:14.381
RuPaul: This is Untucked,
backstage at the competition

00:14.381 --> 00:18.385
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.320
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.320 --> 00:22.656
you're only getting
half the story.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.727
Let's prep Untucked cameras
on the main stage.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.695
All cameras re-po.

00:28.695 --> 00:32.099
RuPaul: Wiwwow Piww.
Bosco.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.734
Jorgeous.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.968
You are safe.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.938
Ladies, you may
leave the stage.

00:42.976 --> 00:46.580
I feel good about
my part in the girl group,

00:46.580 --> 00:49.316
and I am fine
with being safe.

00:49.316 --> 00:52.085
But I wanna be back on top.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.520
I am disappointed.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.922
I wanna be in the top again.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.291
I feel like
I'm doing a good job,

00:57.291 --> 00:59.126
but it's not enough.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.828
There's no room
to do anything okay.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.597
It all has to be excellent,

01:03.597 --> 01:06.066
and I'm capable of doing that.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.834
Untucked cameras
to the werkroom.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.403
Queens walking.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.606
Oh, my God.
We did it, bitches.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.775
We did it.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.243
Oh, I need to get
this shit off me back,

01:16.243 --> 01:17.244
off me back.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.114
Ooh-ee.

01:25.452 --> 01:27.754
So that was a lot of a day.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.057
-Girl, tell me about it.
-Holy fuck.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.224
[laughs]

01:31.224 --> 01:32.359
-Gosh.
-Yes, oh my gosh.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.627
Like, I loved this runway,

01:33.627 --> 01:35.495
but, like, I think
this is, like,

01:35.495 --> 01:37.831
the most immobile
out of my runways.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.232
And I don't know
if y'all think about that

01:39.232 --> 01:40.500
when you're going
down the runway,

01:40.500 --> 01:42.536
you're like, if I have to
lip sync in this look,

01:42.536 --> 01:45.072
this is going to be
an absolute travesty.

01:45.072 --> 01:48.909
I had, like, very few looks
that I can walk in.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.544
You setting yourself up, bitch.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.079
I know. I am.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.481
With the reading challenge,

01:54.481 --> 01:57.684
was there any reads that
you felt people were offended by

01:57.684 --> 01:59.052
or like went too far?

01:59.052 --> 02:00.220
Um...

02:00.220 --> 02:02.489
No, I'm pretty oily

02:02.489 --> 02:04.191
and I have straw-like hair,

02:04.191 --> 02:06.893
so I'm, like,
y'all aren't lying.

02:06.893 --> 02:10.063
Bosco, the human
personification

02:10.063 --> 02:13.400
of a french fry: greasy.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.035
[all laugh]

02:15.035 --> 02:18.271
-Miss Bosco, hay.
-Hi.

02:18.271 --> 02:20.340
Is literally what
your hair is made of, right?

02:20.340 --> 02:22.476
[all laugh]
Oh, my God.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.777
Everyone look at Bosco.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.178
This is what happens
when you give a horse girl

02:25.178 --> 02:26.780
too much valium.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.148
[all laugh]

02:28.148 --> 02:30.150
Whoo!

02:30.150 --> 02:31.618
-And you are a horse girl.
-I am a horse girl.

02:31.618 --> 02:34.388
I introduced the girls
to my step children,

02:34.388 --> 02:36.490
Ted and Fred.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.459
My boyfriend,
he has two horses. [laughs]

02:39.459 --> 02:41.361
I love feeding them
and telling them

02:41.361 --> 02:43.964
that they're beautiful,
and brushing their hair.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.866
I am the horse girl
of the season.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.768
[nickers]
I also just, like,

02:47.768 --> 02:50.103
don't take things
personally very often.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.638
Yeah.

02:51.638 --> 02:52.873
I know Miss Betty

02:52.873 --> 02:55.042
did not enjoy
being called two-faced.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.777
In a way, she's, like,
very sensitive.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.045
I do wanna know

02:58.045 --> 03:00.814
where your read for me
kind of stemmed from.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.483
Well, I did hear

03:03.483 --> 03:05.285
that you had said
some things about me

03:05.285 --> 03:07.587
that you have not yet said
to my face,

03:07.587 --> 03:09.790
along the lines
of I rely on my body

03:09.790 --> 03:11.391
to sell a garment.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.160
Yeah, I said that.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.429
Like, the claws are really
coming out with her.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.430
I love it.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.032
I absolutely adore it.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.134
Oh, my God, I love claws.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.335
I love bite.

03:22.335 --> 03:24.838
You can be
a very, very kind person,

03:24.838 --> 03:26.440
but you don't have to be nice
all the time,

03:26.440 --> 03:29.309
and I really, really
like that about Daya.

03:29.309 --> 03:33.146
Everyone is, like, affected
differently by the competition.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.515
Like, there are people
that are very obviously

03:35.515 --> 03:38.685
more perturbed
by the sweatiness

03:38.685 --> 03:40.554
that is coming upon us.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.055
Do you think Daya
feels that way

03:42.055 --> 03:43.323
'cause she has
so much pressure on her?

03:43.323 --> 03:44.758
I don't know.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.326
I don't know
if it's pressure,

03:46.326 --> 03:47.561
pressure because
she went home first

03:47.561 --> 03:49.196
-and she still hasn't--
-Oh, okay.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.198
Like gotten
the redemption for that.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.166
It's great to be in the top,
but to get the win.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.168
The win,
the W feels very lovely.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.536
-Yeah.
-Yes.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.638
But I think Daya's in the top,

03:58.638 --> 04:00.507
and I feel
really happy about that,

04:00.507 --> 04:02.609
'cause she worked
her ass off.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.311
What about you, Miss Jorgeous?

04:04.311 --> 04:06.146
Oh, my God, I feel so good.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.349
Like, I mean, of course
I wanted to be in the top,

04:09.349 --> 04:12.152
but I'm fine, I'm happy.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.620
I get to slay another day.

04:13.620 --> 04:17.757
Honestly, like, Jasmine
was kind of like struggling,

04:17.757 --> 04:20.927
and I was kind of worried
about, like, my place,

04:20.927 --> 04:23.763
because they could have
judged it on group, you know.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.499
Do you think DeJa's
in the bottom as well?

04:25.499 --> 04:27.400
She seemed to do well
in the performance.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.635
Like, her singing was lovely.

04:28.635 --> 04:31.538
♪ There goes my baby daddy ♪

04:31.538 --> 04:34.608

but we ♪

04:34.608 --> 04:37.677

04:37.677 --> 04:39.146
But at the same time, like,

04:39.146 --> 04:41.481
she set a really high bar
with her runway,

04:41.481 --> 04:43.550
and this one
doesn't quite meet

04:43.550 --> 04:45.185
some of the other things
that she's put on.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.953
And I know that that
kind of like

04:46.953 --> 04:48.822
was on her mind
going into this.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.590
-Yeah.
-So, yeah, girl.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.159
I think DeJa's in the bottom.

04:52.159 --> 04:53.560
Looking at it now,
it's just, like...

04:53.560 --> 04:55.662
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I think so.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.564
Which sucks, because
all three groups

04:57.564 --> 04:59.399
-were really so good.
-Yeah!

04:59.399 --> 05:01.568
Yeah, there wasn't a flop
by any means.

05:01.568 --> 05:04.004
I mean, I do think
Jasmine's in the bottom

05:04.004 --> 05:07.340
just because,
her, like, vocals

05:07.340 --> 05:09.809
weren't as good
as the two of you.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.779

I don't know
who the third is.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.986
The thing is
I didn't watch the Supremes

05:19.986 --> 05:21.588
when we actually performed it.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.089
I couldn't really see
what was happening.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.091
Camden and Kerri
sounded good on the track,

05:25.091 --> 05:28.261
but I imagine one of them
would have to be in the bottom.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.329
Yeah.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.167

05:34.167 --> 05:37.304
I know Kerri
was struggling with choreo.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.706
You know by taking
the Supremes role

05:39.706 --> 05:42.108
that put a target
on your back.

05:43.243 --> 05:46.112
I wanted the Ru-Premes
at first, but then I was, like,

05:46.112 --> 05:47.547
oh, yeah, that's
RuPaul's like, favorite, like...

05:47.547 --> 05:48.915
Yeah.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.817
So I was not gonna
put myself at, like,

05:50.817 --> 05:53.019
a standard like that.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.522
Angie absolutely
delivered vocal-wise,

05:55.522 --> 05:58.225
so I'm sure Angie
is, like, vibing.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.193
-Angie is Diana Ross.
-Yeah.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.561
The only person who I think

06:01.561 --> 06:04.030
is, like, heads and toes
on the score sheet

06:04.030 --> 06:05.599
above everyone
is Angie right now.

06:05.599 --> 06:08.401
But, like, usually

06:08.401 --> 06:11.738
there are four top spots
at the end of each season.

06:11.738 --> 06:14.674
It's so fucking stressful,

06:14.674 --> 06:17.277
-but exciting. [laughs]
-It is!

06:17.277 --> 06:19.913
So how did y'all feel
about Miss Ts Madison

06:19.913 --> 06:22.849
coming in Untucked last week?

06:22.849 --> 06:24.551
-Doll.
-She's amazing.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.585
I love this woman.

06:25.585 --> 06:28.421
That segued into our

06:28.421 --> 06:31.124
fun little, like,
crying fest.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.125
Yes.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.327
It was just so, like, amazing

06:34.327 --> 06:36.630
for you to tell everyone
that you're non-binary,

06:36.630 --> 06:37.764
'cause I definitely thought

06:37.764 --> 06:39.432
it made other people
feel comfortable

06:39.432 --> 06:41.601
about themselves
and everything.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.503
Bosco's something
that I use

06:43.503 --> 06:46.306
to, like, feel a lot
of gender euphoria.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.074
And, like,
during the pandemic,

06:48.074 --> 06:50.176
like, I had to go
an entire year without her.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.878
I work in customer service,

06:51.878 --> 06:55.415
so I'm spending my entire day
being, like, "he, him-ed."

06:55.415 --> 06:59.552
It was such a hard, hard time
to go through,

06:59.552 --> 07:03.290
and I'm so happy to be,
like, back in the saddle

07:03.290 --> 07:05.258
in a way, 'cause, like,
it feels, like,

07:05.258 --> 07:08.128
okay, I'm finding
my equilibrium again

07:08.128 --> 07:11.131
after, like, a year
of not having her.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.968
I always go back and forth

07:14.968 --> 07:16.603
between "they" and "her,"

07:16.603 --> 07:19.372
and sometimes masculine
pronouns are okay.

07:19.372 --> 07:23.009
But COVID was hard
in a similar sense that

07:23.009 --> 07:24.978
I didn't have Willow

07:24.978 --> 07:27.881
to help me navigate
most of it.

07:27.881 --> 07:31.284
I felt that, like,
lost sense of euphoria, too.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.620
And it's confusing for me
because so much of it

07:33.620 --> 07:37.724
is tied into, like,
my body medically.

07:37.724 --> 07:41.127
It just complicates everything

07:41.127 --> 07:44.764
when your health is at stake

07:44.764 --> 07:48.601
and you're kind of fucked

07:48.601 --> 07:51.104
in your visual
perception of yourself

07:51.104 --> 07:54.808
because of
what's going on with you.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.210
I'm not really sure
where I'm at

07:57.210 --> 08:00.180
with my body and my gender,
to be honest.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.848
Because of my illness,

08:01.848 --> 08:04.784
I've felt this distance
from my body

08:04.784 --> 08:07.754
for a long, long time.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.255
And so now
that I'm getting older

08:09.255 --> 08:12.025
and I'm finally building
this relationship with my body,

08:12.025 --> 08:14.127
I'm having to learn
what do I like

08:14.127 --> 08:15.195
and what do I not like?

08:15.195 --> 08:16.262
What do I feel connected to

08:16.262 --> 08:18.098
and what do I not
feel connected to?

08:18.098 --> 08:19.532
I don't know.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.134
It's like
a really complicated thing

08:21.134 --> 08:23.203
for me
to have to think about,

08:23.203 --> 08:26.172
because it involves
more elements for me

08:26.172 --> 08:27.640
than just gender.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.676
-Yeah.
-And gender expression.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.479
But since being here,
I've been so happy,

08:32.479 --> 08:34.848
and part of me
is thinking, like,

08:34.848 --> 08:37.417
I think I've just been happy
because I've been able

08:37.417 --> 08:40.653
to, like, see myself
the way I wanna see myself,

08:40.653 --> 08:43.323
like, on a daily basis.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.192
And so there's a lot
to think about

08:46.192 --> 08:47.794
in the coming years.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.829
Hey, bitches.
Welcome to the '60s.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.232
Oh, Lord.

08:52.232 --> 08:55.301
-What's the tea, bitches?
-What's the tea?

08:55.301 --> 08:58.671
There's not a lot of ladies
in this Untucked today.

08:58.671 --> 08:59.939
Ugh.

08:59.939 --> 09:01.875
You a ho, you a ho.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.343
-You cool.
-Thank you.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.711
-You a bitch.
-[laughs]

09:04.711 --> 09:07.280
So first of all,
what did they say about me?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.115
[all laugh]
Oh, my God.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.418
So I'm in the top three.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.286
[cheering]
What?

09:17.757 --> 09:20.627
This is my least favorite look
I brought here,

09:20.627 --> 09:21.995
and they fucking ate it up.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.496
They said, like,
you're showing versatility.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.132
This is so different for DeJa.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.001
I think the only negative
about my performance

09:28.001 --> 09:29.002
was, like,
they would have loved me

09:29.002 --> 09:30.370
to push a little more.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.205
But overall,
they, like, loved me,

09:32.205 --> 09:34.774
and I'm recording an album
after this.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.444
-[laughs]
-Hit it, bitch.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.912
All right, enough about me.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.146
Miss Kerri Colby?

09:40.146 --> 09:42.115
I'll go next.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.417
They said that The Ru-Premes
were entertaining

09:44.417 --> 09:47.187
but they said that I kind of
read a little more churchy.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.622
And I don't
completely disagree.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.458
That's very much
in my background.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.593
I think that I probably went

09:53.593 --> 09:55.662
and praised Jesus
a little too much.

09:55.662 --> 09:59.299
I grew up
very involved with the church.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.100
My dad was a praise singer,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.036
which means
he would sing the songs

10:03.036 --> 10:06.573
and kind of lead everyone
in worship on Sundays.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.308
I was very much that kid

10:08.308 --> 10:11.344
that loved to run around
and praise Jesus.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.780
I don't know. I guess
I can still be that church lady

10:13.780 --> 10:15.849
when I perform sometimes.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.250
[laughs]

10:17.250 --> 10:20.086
So I'll be lip syncing.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.521
What about you, Miss Daya?

10:21.521 --> 10:24.457
They really liked me this week.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.292
[cheering]
I knew it.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.294
And, bitch,
you've been waiting for this.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.729
I know, and it's,
like, so unreal.

10:29.729 --> 10:32.031
And I just wanna thank
both of you guys.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.267
I am not a strong dancer.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.169
That is not something
I've ever felt confident in,

10:36.169 --> 10:38.271
and you guys
really helped me with that.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.440
So thank you both
from the bottom of my heart.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.475
-I really appreciate it.
-You're welcome.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.179
The way that you
have broken through

10:46.179 --> 10:48.248
this, like, stagnant,
like, being safe

10:48.248 --> 10:51.551
and, like, I feel like
something changed.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.887
You can tell that, like,
you're, like, in it.

10:53.887 --> 10:57.023
No, that bitch was mad.
That's what that was, bitch.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.092
She's like, God damn,
bitch, safe again?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.527
[laughs]

11:00.527 --> 11:03.396
So I'm definitely
in the bottom three.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.765
I just was, like, so focused
maybe on the wrong thing,

11:05.765 --> 11:08.067
and not just, like,
having fun with it.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.270
I did kind of fade
into the background,

11:10.270 --> 11:12.372
so that's heart breaking.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.675
I'm sort of, like,
hoping I'm not lip syncing,

11:15.675 --> 11:18.745
but I'm gonna be
preparing myself to do so.

11:18.745 --> 11:22.348
I think I will be the one
lip syncing, not you.

11:22.348 --> 11:26.486
They could tell in my eyes
that I wasn't having fun,

11:26.486 --> 11:30.189
and I was more focused
on getting the choreo.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.393
I felt like I could see you
thinking about the dance steps

11:33.393 --> 11:35.662
instead of
being the character.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.131
I guess I'm just,
really, like, pissed.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.034
I put myself
at such a high standard

11:41.034 --> 11:42.535
of, like, choreo
and things like that

11:42.535 --> 11:45.672
that, like, I guess
I, like, was too focused on it.

11:45.672 --> 11:49.709
So I definitely think
it's going to be me and Kerri.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.578
I think you're gonna be safe.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.846
I don't know.
If I do have to lip sync,

11:53.846 --> 11:56.316
I'm gonna fucking turn it out.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.818
-You showed us last week.
-Yeah.

11:58.818 --> 12:02.388
The math is saying
that Miss Angie is a top then.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.290
And it feels
really, really good

12:04.290 --> 12:07.393
to be in the top
this particular week

12:07.393 --> 12:10.530
because it's, like, bitch,
I got two right feet.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.800
Bitch, even if the choreography
is simple, like, bitch, I--

12:13.800 --> 12:15.501
Bitch. [laughs]

12:15.501 --> 12:17.203
Ooh, girl.
Like, bitch, y'all saw me

12:17.203 --> 12:18.771
on that stage, bitch.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.374
-So, bitch, like, out of all--
-Stop it!

12:21.374 --> 12:24.043
You said, like,
a million "bitches."

12:24.043 --> 12:26.446
Bitch.
[all laugh]

12:26.446 --> 12:29.215
Ladies, five minutes.
Five minutes.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.917
-Okay.
-On that note,

12:30.917 --> 12:34.120
I'm gonna go out there
and learn these lyrics.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.756
I'm actually gonna utilize
that lounge no one does.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.091
[laughs]

12:38.091 --> 12:39.192
Bye.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.259
Come here now.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.895
Yay. My Willow.

12:42.895 --> 12:44.330
Okay.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.565
My Angelica.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.501
Kerri, I love you so much.

12:48.501 --> 12:49.636
I love you, too, baby.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.304
And, like, what I said
to you last week,

12:51.304 --> 12:53.973
if I can be
half of the woman you are

12:53.973 --> 12:56.409
when I start with my hormones
and things like that--

12:56.409 --> 12:58.845
You're gonna be all the woman
that you need to be,

12:58.845 --> 13:00.279
and I'm really excited
to see that.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.116
Yeah, and, like, you have
such a confidence

13:03.116 --> 13:04.951
that I've never seen,
you know.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.552
You have this carry--

13:06.552 --> 13:09.422
you carry yourself
in a way

13:09.422 --> 13:12.291
that I've never seen anybody
in this entire competition

13:12.291 --> 13:14.193
that has ever done that.

13:14.193 --> 13:16.462
I just feel
a tran-tasy, child.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.932
A tran-tasy.
[laughs] Yes!

13:19.932 --> 13:23.002
And, like,
if we have to lip sync,

13:23.002 --> 13:24.003
don't hold back.

13:24.003 --> 13:25.204
-Please don't.
-Okay.

13:25.204 --> 13:27.507
That's why I'm gonna
listen to this song.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.675
You never know.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.815
I'm so excited that we got
a performance challenge, though.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.886
Like, it was such a good break
from acting. [laughs]

13:39.886 --> 13:41.654
For me specifically,

13:41.654 --> 13:43.523
like, the talent show
was not a good week for me.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.291
How did you feel, like,

13:45.291 --> 13:47.960
approaching the performance
challenge, like, before?

13:47.960 --> 13:49.395
I was being selfish.

13:49.395 --> 13:50.697
Okay.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.799
Because I knew where I stood
in the competition

13:52.799 --> 13:53.966
I needed to stand out.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.802
-Yeah.
-And if people thought

13:55.802 --> 13:59.138
I was being two-faced--
Jasmine or whatever, like--

13:59.138 --> 14:01.140
What is it
about that particular note--

14:01.140 --> 14:04.210
That read?
It drives me fucking crazy.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.845
-I'm like...
-It really stung.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.848
Particularly, I was, like,
what did I do to her?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.284
I will, say, like, recently,

14:11.284 --> 14:13.820
like, bitch, your claws
have been coming out, bitch.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.755
I don't care.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.056
I mean, sometimes you have to.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.092
I'm not gonna sit around
and let our friendships

14:19.092 --> 14:21.594
get in the way of us
trying to win this thing.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.097
If it does offend you that
I'm doing what I need to do

14:24.097 --> 14:26.833
to place myself higher,
then that just shows me

14:26.833 --> 14:29.268
that you don't care
about the competition.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.341
By the judges critiques,
I feel like it is gonna be

14:35.341 --> 14:38.211
Jasmine or myself
going home tonight.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.079
I just wanna focus,

14:40.079 --> 14:42.181
tap into the song.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.416
I have to make sure

14:43.416 --> 14:46.319
that I give a really
beautiful performance

14:46.319 --> 14:47.887
that impresses Ru
so I can come back

14:47.887 --> 14:49.422
and slay another week.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.560
I'm nervous in the sense that

14:54.560 --> 14:56.562
I just don't wanna
lip sync against Kerri.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.865
That's what I'm, like,
mainly thinking about.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.333
I know
I'm gonna give it my all,

15:00.333 --> 15:03.770
but it just feels like
a stab in the heart, you know?

15:03.770 --> 15:06.139
But, like, it's definitely
gonna be a battle.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.306
That's for sure.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.308
All right, ladies,
time for the main stage.

15:09.308 --> 15:10.309
Follow me.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.011
-Ooh, yes.
-Come on, y'all.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.479
-We're going.
-We coming.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.248
Girl, don't rush us.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.483
I'm just drinking
some more of my cocktail.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.318
-[sneezes]
-Ooh!

15:20.753 --> 15:22.021
RuPaul: Welcome back, ladies.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.956
I've made some decisions.

15:23.956 --> 15:25.291
Jasmine Kennedie.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.993
Kerri Colby.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.795
The time has come...

15:28.795 --> 15:30.630
for you to lip sync...

15:30.630 --> 15:34.700
for your life!

15:38.204 --> 15:42.008
Kerri Colby, sashay away.

15:42.008 --> 15:45.044
I love you so much. [sobs]

15:45.044 --> 15:46.946
[cheers and applause]

15:46.946 --> 15:47.947
I love you.

15:49.982 --> 15:52.552
I feel completely devastated.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.054
I gave everything I had.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.356
I do have a story to share,

15:57.356 --> 16:00.927
so to have it taken
away from me at this time,

16:00.927 --> 16:02.895
it feels a little soon.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.530
But I get it.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.833
This is a competition.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.434
[sighs]

16:08.434 --> 16:10.803
Hi, werkroom.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.373
Time to pack things up.

16:14.373 --> 16:16.642
There's so much stuff.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.514
All right.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.816
These fabulous garments,
darling.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.221
Oh, shit, y'all.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.957
Y'all done got the notes.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.793
I need to sit down
for these, honey.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.661
Let's see.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.167
Oh, it's Bosco.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.636
See, I'm already emotional.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.171
"Dear Miss Kerri,

16:45.171 --> 16:48.074
I honestly adore you."
Hearts.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.675
"I love your energy,
openness,

16:49.675 --> 16:52.111
"drag, and your shoes.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.547
"You better get your ass
to Seattle

16:54.547 --> 16:55.848
"so I can show you around

16:55.848 --> 16:58.384
and introduce you
to my boyfriend."

16:58.384 --> 17:01.587
Damn, all these letters
is big as hell.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.957
All right,
this one's from Jasmine.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.859
Since she sent me home,
she felt bad.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.628
She had to write me something.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.196
"Dear Miss Kerri Colby,

17:10.196 --> 17:12.798
"I feel so effing bad

17:12.798 --> 17:15.735
"that I had to lip sync
against you.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.503
"You have been
such a blessing to me

17:17.503 --> 17:19.305
"through this competition.

17:19.305 --> 17:22.308
"You taught me
to be yourself at all times

17:22.308 --> 17:25.578
"regardless of
who doesn't like you

17:25.578 --> 17:27.713
or your choices in life."

17:27.713 --> 17:29.382
Aw, precious angel.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.517
"I am going to win for you.

17:31.517 --> 17:34.253
"You are the reason
I was able to come out,

17:34.253 --> 17:36.789
"and I am forever
thankful for that.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.325
I love you
with all my heart."

17:39.325 --> 17:41.761
These are precious,
you guys.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.663
This is really
showing me that, like,

17:43.663 --> 17:45.231
we really touched each other.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.533
It really was
so much more of a sisterhood.

17:47.533 --> 17:51.304
It really is just shocking

17:51.304 --> 17:54.173
to see where drag is going.

17:54.173 --> 17:55.875
And it's beautiful,

17:55.875 --> 17:58.144
and I just can't wait
for what's next,

17:58.144 --> 18:01.814
'cause I know that God
has a plan somewhere, honey,

18:01.814 --> 18:03.783
it's gonna be fierce.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.785
I've really enjoyed the ride.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.754
It's been a really
just crazy experience

18:08.754 --> 18:11.123
that I'm so blessed
to be a part of,

18:11.123 --> 18:13.993
but I'm definitely gonna be,
like, what the fuck?

18:13.993 --> 18:15.294
For months to come.

18:15.294 --> 18:16.495
But I wouldn't take it back

18:16.495 --> 18:19.231
for, like, anything
in the world at all.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.400
I was able to open up
a lot of parts of myself

18:21.400 --> 18:24.303
that I usually keep
more reserved.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.805
I think it's gonna be
really, really exciting,

18:25.805 --> 18:29.241
and I've been able to be
so vulnerable and honest,

18:29.241 --> 18:31.143
so I can't wait to see
where it takes me.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.279
I know it's gonna be great.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.748
All right.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.350
It's go time.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.155
[sighs]
Well, the tran-tasy and fantasy

18:43.155 --> 18:46.425
might be leaving,
but it doesn't mean

18:46.425 --> 18:48.661
that this is the end
of anything, darling.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.832
I think I gave a voice

18:52.832 --> 18:55.401
to an entire group
of beautiful people

18:55.401 --> 18:59.505
who feel like they need
to find a place to fit,

18:59.505 --> 19:02.708
and I just can't wait
to feel the love

19:02.708 --> 19:05.444
of all those fabulous people
who watch the show

19:05.444 --> 19:08.080
and share
this journey with me.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.286
[sighs]

19:14.286 --> 19:16.322
And just remember, America,

19:16.322 --> 19:20.059
I will always be
your viral obsession.
