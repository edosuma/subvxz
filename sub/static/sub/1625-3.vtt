WEBVTT

00:01.354 --> 00:03.056
Max, I can't wait to go home

00:03.057 --> 00:05.537
and ilegally download that documentary
about performance art.

00:05.554 --> 00:07.034
And I can't wait to go home and watch

00:07.035 --> 00:08.237
"Here comes Honey Boo Boo."

00:08.954 --> 00:10.237
But first you have to see this.

00:10.354 --> 00:12.037
Her name is Marina Abramovic.

00:12.038 --> 00:14.918
In the 90's she and her boyfriend
did this piece called "Confrontation"

00:14.919 --> 00:17.039
where they just slapped
each other's faces for days.

00:17.338 --> 00:18.003
Yeah?

00:18.004 --> 00:19.537
My mom and her boyfriend did that too,

00:19.539 --> 00:22.390
but they called it,
"Who smoked the last cigarette."

00:22.392 --> 00:25.042
No, really, it was pure art.
She's a genius.

00:25.044 --> 00:28.212
How about you and I
do a little art right now?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:39.685 --> 00:41.017
What are they doing?

00:41.019 --> 00:42.485
I think they might be doing a scene

00:42.487 --> 00:44.554
from <i>Fifty Shades Of Grey.</i>

00:49.160 --> 00:50.827
Okay, stop.

00:50.829 --> 00:52.162
Okay.

00:55.767 --> 00:57.687
That's for suggesting
we make a lip-synch video

00:57.688 --> 00:59.936
to <i>Call Me Maybe.</i>

01:08.942 --> 01:13.010

01:22.726 --> 01:24.893
What's up, my man?
You look pretty down.

01:24.895 --> 01:26.595
My mother in Korea is working

01:26.597 --> 01:28.330
my last nerve, you know, Earl?

01:28.832 --> 01:32.033
Well, I didn't expect
a back and forth here.

01:34.570 --> 01:37.305
Max, do you wanna move in?

01:37.307 --> 01:40.008
Han, you can't let your mommy
keep bullying you.

01:40.010 --> 01:43.044
Stand up to her.
You're a 53-year-old man.

01:46.983 --> 01:50.252
Max, I am 29.

01:50.254 --> 01:53.488
What?

01:53.490 --> 01:55.423
I am 29.

01:55.425 --> 01:58.393
What do you got, a case
of the Benjamin Buttons?

01:59.762 --> 02:02.497
Caroline, Han says he's 29.

02:02.499 --> 02:05.000
What?

02:05.002 --> 02:06.368
Han, are you sure?

02:06.370 --> 02:08.502
Yes, what makes you think I'm older?

02:08.505 --> 02:10.437
Well, everything...
your hair, your clothes,

02:10.440 --> 02:14.075
the $5 check you gave me for my birthday.

02:19.982 --> 02:23.618
Hi, can I help you?
That sounded so sincere.

02:23.620 --> 02:26.955
Well, when you're in my section,
you'll meet the real me.

02:26.957 --> 02:29.457
I have one question.
Do you wanna live?

02:29.459 --> 02:32.193
Actually, today, I could go either way.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.728
You see this?

02:33.730 --> 02:35.570
Go around the diner
and have everyone fill it

02:35.571 --> 02:36.891
with the contents of their purse,

02:36.892 --> 02:38.833
and if you do, nobody gets hurt.

02:38.835 --> 02:40.302
Okay, okay, okay, but, I don't know

02:40.304 --> 02:41.736
how much you're gonna collect here.

02:41.738 --> 02:43.905
I mean, most of these customers
pay with coins

02:43.907 --> 02:46.641
or fresh tomatoes from their garden.

02:46.643 --> 02:48.143
Earl, listen up.

02:48.145 --> 02:49.865
We're being robbed by that man in the suit,

02:49.866 --> 02:52.186
and he wants everyone to empty
their stuff into this bag.

02:52.187 --> 02:54.182
Max, I've been on both sides

02:54.184 --> 02:55.987
of this situation,

02:58.989 --> 03:03.158
and the best thing to do is play along.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.561
Okay, Caroline,
I'm gonna tell you something,

03:06.563 --> 03:07.996
and I don't want you to react.

03:07.998 --> 03:09.998
I knew you were gonna get pregnant.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.834
Damn it!
All right, fine.

03:12.836 --> 03:14.602
- We'll get through this together.
- No!

03:14.604 --> 03:17.405
Look, we're being robbed,
and that guy in the suit

03:17.407 --> 03:19.007
might have a gun.

03:19.009 --> 03:22.010
No, no... just do what I say,
and stay calm.

03:22.012 --> 03:24.079
I need you to empty your purse
into the trash bag.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.349
I can't believe this is happening

03:27.351 --> 03:29.684
just when I saved $2.

03:29.686 --> 03:32.587
Max, I can't die, and I certainly can't die

03:32.589 --> 03:34.255
in this ugly uniform.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.324
I mean, it looks good on you.

03:39.895 --> 03:42.630
Are you having a heart attack?

03:42.632 --> 03:44.699
I'm peeing.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.802
What do you mean?

03:47.804 --> 03:52.073
I'm really freaked out, and I'm peeing.

03:52.075 --> 03:53.241
I can't stop!

03:53.243 --> 03:55.243
Just stop, stop!
Clench it.

03:55.245 --> 03:57.045
Okay.

03:57.047 --> 04:00.148
No, can't.

04:00.150 --> 04:01.483
Step out from behind the counter.

04:01.485 --> 04:02.951
Sorry, sir, I can't.

04:02.953 --> 04:06.755
- Why?
- Well, I'm peeing.

04:07.257 --> 04:08.890
Still?

04:08.892 --> 04:10.792
Out of the way, girls.
I'll take down this...

04:10.794 --> 04:13.762
whoa!

04:13.764 --> 04:15.597
Get away from him.

04:15.599 --> 04:17.759
Miss, you need to get out
from behind the counter now

04:17.760 --> 04:20.969
- before I...
- Please take her, not me.

04:20.971 --> 04:23.004
- What's happening?
- Han, we're being robbed.

04:23.506 --> 04:24.639
So sorry.

04:24.641 --> 04:26.508
Please take everything

04:26.510 --> 04:29.778
that is
in my manny-pack.

04:29.780 --> 04:33.181
Would it be possible
if I took my prayer beads out?

04:33.183 --> 04:37.085
They've been in my family
for hundreds and hundreds of...

04:37.087 --> 04:40.155
I don't think so, homeboy.

04:45.261 --> 04:48.329
You're in my house now, bitch.

04:55.470 --> 04:57.272
Here's what's left in the bag.

04:57.274 --> 05:00.275
Nope, sorry.
I don't see your dignity.

05:00.277 --> 05:02.043
Max, don't.

05:02.045 --> 05:04.179
Isn't it enough that
I'm wearing dishwasher whites

05:04.181 --> 05:06.748
that have been around
since the invention of B.O.?

05:09.552 --> 05:13.621
Look at that, something
ate right through the swiffer,

05:13.623 --> 05:16.558
and I don't think it was the bleach.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.961
How will you ever live with the shame?

05:19.963 --> 05:22.464
Can you believe
that is the man who saved us?

05:22.466 --> 05:24.666
Yeah, I did not see a gun coming.

05:24.668 --> 05:27.535
I saw nunchucks, ninja smoke,
maybe some hairpulling,

05:27.537 --> 05:28.970
but not a gun.

05:28.972 --> 05:31.573
Well, good night, ladies.

05:31.575 --> 05:34.309
I thought we all acted very brave tonight.

05:34.311 --> 05:37.312
Well, some of us.

05:37.314 --> 05:40.348
Yeah, I had a trauma, and I urinated.

05:40.350 --> 05:43.585
Ha, ha!
That's hilarious.

05:43.587 --> 05:45.086
Yeah, you might need some counseling.

05:45.088 --> 05:46.721
I could drop you off at a therapist

05:46.723 --> 05:50.225
on the way to my "I was a human
shield" support group.

05:50.227 --> 05:52.393
Am I ever gonna live this down?

05:52.395 --> 05:55.063
It happened, like, ten minutes ago.

05:55.065 --> 05:58.233
Okay, let's move on.

05:58.235 --> 06:01.436
Look, someone left
a coupon for free movie popcorn.

06:01.438 --> 06:04.839
I'd love to escape to a movie after my...

06:04.841 --> 06:08.076
well, I'd just love to escape.

06:08.078 --> 06:10.578
How much are movies now, like 200 bucks?

06:10.580 --> 06:13.848
Unless you go with me,
in which case, it is free.

06:13.850 --> 06:15.350
I'll take you tomorrow.

06:15.352 --> 06:17.352
I've been sneaking into theaters
since I was two.

06:17.354 --> 06:18.674
I crawled into <i>The Little Mermaid</i>

06:18.675 --> 06:19.854
with a sack full of Cheerios

06:19.856 --> 06:22.023
and a baby bottle full of Diet Coke.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.762
You know, Chestnut, the only thing

06:27.764 --> 06:30.131
that got me through that robbery was you.

06:30.133 --> 06:32.467
I kept thinking,
"who will take care of you?"

06:32.469 --> 06:35.570
Because you can't count
on blondie selfish-pants

06:35.572 --> 06:38.306
who used me as a human shield
and then peed herself.

06:38.808 --> 06:40.975
Do not tell Chestnut I peed myself.

06:40.977 --> 06:44.646
He's the only one from my circle
who still talks to me.

06:44.648 --> 06:48.416
As I was saying, Chestnut,
I would have taken a bullet

06:48.418 --> 06:50.084
for her, but she put herself first,

06:50.086 --> 06:51.920
and that's okay.
It's fine.

06:51.922 --> 06:54.422
Max, I'm surprised
you're even affected by this.

06:54.424 --> 06:57.792
I mean, weren't you shot as a baby?

06:57.794 --> 06:59.394
I feel like you told me that.

06:59.396 --> 07:03.131
No, I told you I drank shots as a baby.

07:03.133 --> 07:06.167
My mother hated to drink alone.

07:06.169 --> 07:07.669
Okay, what free movie should we see?

07:07.671 --> 07:09.904
Maybe something with a Fanning in it?

07:09.906 --> 07:12.340
I'll see anything
unless it's in 3-D.

07:12.342 --> 07:14.382
I mean, if something's
gonna be flying at my face,

07:14.383 --> 07:16.844
I'd better get a free prime rib out of it.

07:16.846 --> 07:19.480
So what do we do, Max?
What do we do?

07:19.482 --> 07:21.402
Hide in the back alley
till the coast is clear,

07:21.403 --> 07:24.152
and when the door opens,
make a break for it?

07:24.154 --> 07:27.188
No, 'cause it's not the 1940s.

07:27.190 --> 07:28.957
We just go right up in the usher's face,

07:28.959 --> 07:31.593
make an excuse, and then
boldly walk with purpose.

07:31.595 --> 07:33.328
Okay, well, just show me how.

07:33.330 --> 07:35.430
You can direct me.
I've done a lot of plays.

07:35.432 --> 07:37.498
I could do my "Eliza Doolittle"

07:37.500 --> 07:40.435
before she was civilized" walk.

07:40.437 --> 07:43.504
Hello, governor.

07:45.441 --> 07:48.476
Wow, that was just ugly.
I wish I hadn't seen it.

07:48.478 --> 07:52.447
All right, just watch me.

07:52.449 --> 07:56.818
Walk, walk, walk, hair flip, walk, walk.

07:56.820 --> 07:59.721
Walk, walk, walk, hair flip, walk, walk.

08:01.724 --> 08:04.392
Good, but easy
on the hair flip, Willow Smith.

08:08.665 --> 08:11.132
Hi, girls.

08:11.134 --> 08:13.334
I heard what happened.

08:13.336 --> 08:16.170
Max, you got pushed in front of a gun.

08:16.172 --> 08:19.240
You must be very pissed.

08:20.476 --> 08:23.911
Caroline, what a nice outfit.

08:23.913 --> 08:28.082
On a scale of one to ten, you're an eight.

08:28.084 --> 08:29.651
Get it?
Urinate.

08:35.091 --> 08:36.991
How do you even know what happened?

08:36.993 --> 08:39.494
Well, Oleg told me when we were upstairs

08:39.496 --> 08:43.231
playing "hide the penis,"

08:43.232 --> 08:45.500
and we laughed so hard,
we almost peed ourselves,

08:45.502 --> 08:48.569
but we didn't because we're not you.

08:50.439 --> 08:52.607
Actually, we're going to a movie.

08:52.609 --> 08:54.909
Well, that's nice.

08:54.911 --> 08:58.112
I hope you're gonna wear
your big girl pants.

08:58.614 --> 09:00.948
- Max.
- What? It's silly and funny.

09:00.950 --> 09:04.752
She's like a Polish fart cushion.

09:04.754 --> 09:06.274
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

09:06.275 --> 09:07.922
there can't be any pee jokes left.

09:07.924 --> 09:09.524
What are you seeing,

09:09.526 --> 09:12.360
something rated "pee pee 13"?

09:15.198 --> 09:17.665
Fart cushions are funny.

09:26.196 --> 09:28.236
- There's the guy.
- I'm getting a little nervous.

09:28.237 --> 09:29.797
I'm starting to sweat like those people

09:29.798 --> 09:32.068
on <i>Locked Up Abroad.</i>
I don't know why.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.936
I haven't swallowed a heroin balloon.

09:33.938 --> 09:35.505
Okay, let's go.

09:35.507 --> 09:39.108
Pretend we're out of breath.

09:39.110 --> 09:42.078
Out of breath, not out of your mind.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.695
Hey, sorry.

09:43.696 --> 09:45.776
Can we just run back
into the theater for a second?

09:45.778 --> 09:47.698
I left my iPhone in there,
and the prescription

09:47.699 --> 09:49.339
for her anti-seizure
medication's on it.

09:49.340 --> 09:50.853
Yeah, which theater were you in?

09:50.855 --> 09:52.722
Theatre five.
Went to the 11:15.

09:52.724 --> 09:54.390
Got out at 1:20.
A little long.

09:54.392 --> 09:56.459
Could've cut ten from it.

10:00.764 --> 10:02.565
Wow, your walk with purpose is getting

10:02.567 --> 10:04.767
almost as impressive as Han's "bang, bang,"

10:04.769 --> 10:06.803
you're in my house now,
bitch!"

10:06.805 --> 10:08.738
I know.
What about Han?

10:08.740 --> 10:11.574
Before yesterday, we thought
he was 53 and unarmed.

10:11.576 --> 10:13.696
Guess we learn something new
about people every day.

10:13.697 --> 10:14.737
Yeah, like having to learn

10:14.738 --> 10:16.813
that when you get nervous, I'm disposable.

10:17.315 --> 10:20.783
That was very uncharacteristic of me.

10:20.785 --> 10:24.220
Hi, Hallelujah.

10:24.222 --> 10:25.721
Cool name, by the way.

10:25.723 --> 10:27.223
How are you doing today, Hallelujah?

10:27.225 --> 10:29.258
Bitter.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.100
They wouldn't let me put
an exclamation point

10:31.101 --> 10:32.962
on my name tag.

10:32.964 --> 10:34.464
Is there any way you could make

10:34.466 --> 10:35.798
a fresh batch of popcorn?

10:35.800 --> 10:37.800
I could, but it takes ten minutes,

10:37.802 --> 10:39.168
and your show starts in two.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.603
Actually, it takes 31/2,

10:40.605 --> 10:41.904
and I can miss a few trailers.

10:41.906 --> 10:43.506
I used to work at a Cineplex Five.

10:43.508 --> 10:47.310
So now you just know everything about life?

10:47.312 --> 10:49.779
Come on, the opening scene sets up

10:49.781 --> 10:51.514
where he gets his superpowers from.

10:51.516 --> 10:55.751
Hey, Hallelujah here
is doing the best he can.

10:55.753 --> 10:57.186
I mean, based on his name,

10:57.188 --> 10:59.290
his parents clearly had
bigger dreams for him,

10:59.291 --> 11:01.491
and it is not his fault
you guys showed up two minutes

11:01.493 --> 11:02.992
before the show starts.

11:02.994 --> 11:05.128
Maybe next time,
you'll show up ten minutes early

11:05.130 --> 11:07.196
without the attitude
and the fidgety exhaling.

11:07.198 --> 11:08.758
You think Hallelujah doesn't hear that?

11:08.759 --> 11:12.368
- He does.
- Sorry to be such a problem.

11:12.370 --> 11:14.050
We'll just take whatever you've got ready.

11:14.051 --> 11:16.606
No, girl.
I got you.

11:16.608 --> 11:18.274
I'm gonna make you a fresh batch.

11:18.276 --> 11:20.343
Hallelujah, could I have some fresh too?

11:20.345 --> 11:22.945
You'll get the burnt ones
and like it, nerd.

11:27.451 --> 11:29.051
Let's sit down here.

11:29.053 --> 11:30.453
I'm not sticking to the floor yet.

11:30.455 --> 11:32.788
Fancy theater.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.290
Hey, guys.

11:34.292 --> 11:35.892
Hope I wasn't too hard on you out there.

11:36.394 --> 11:37.593
Nice cape.

11:37.695 --> 11:39.996
Thanks.
I had it in my backpack.

11:39.998 --> 11:43.065
I wasn't sure.

11:46.036 --> 11:48.204
You made the right choice.

11:50.141 --> 11:51.507
She likes my cape.

11:51.509 --> 11:53.745
Technically, she likes your sister's cape.

11:56.747 --> 11:59.315
Okay, so I don't know anything
about these superhero movies.

11:59.317 --> 12:01.717
It's a remake of a prequel to a sequel?

12:01.719 --> 12:03.419
- I'm already confused.
- Okay.

12:03.421 --> 12:08.558
So there's always a nerdy guy...

12:08.560 --> 12:10.293
And he's either been wronged or bitten

12:10.294 --> 12:11.494
or exposed to something toxic.

12:11.496 --> 12:13.104
It gives him superpowers.

12:13.105 --> 12:15.505
He's in love with a pretty girl
who his rival tries to kill

12:15.506 --> 12:16.786
but then won't because they have

12:16.787 --> 12:17.667
to make another movie.

12:17.669 --> 12:19.068
Also, partial nudity,

12:19.070 --> 12:20.503
product placement, dope explosions,

12:20.505 --> 12:23.072
and a killer score by Hans Zimmer.

12:23.574 --> 12:25.454
Okay, your knowledge
of these superhero movies

12:25.455 --> 12:28.277
is kind of turning me on right now.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.548
Wait.
Are you kidding me?

12:32.550 --> 12:34.717
The hero has red hair as a child?

12:34.719 --> 12:36.786
Weird, 'cause when he grows up,

12:36.788 --> 12:39.088
he has black hair.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.890
Was there some sort of chemical spill,

12:40.892 --> 12:43.926
which, by the way, wasn't
in the original comic book!

12:43.928 --> 12:45.595
- What am I, dumb?
- Okay.

12:45.897 --> 12:47.230
Okay, come on.

12:47.232 --> 12:48.632
Come on, let's go to another movie.

12:48.633 --> 12:49.799
What are you talking about?

12:49.801 --> 12:51.067
Well, you obviously hate this.

12:51.069 --> 12:52.301
You're yelling at the screen.

12:52.303 --> 12:53.823
Yelling at the screen is the best part

12:53.824 --> 12:55.664
of going to the movies,
and more white people

12:55.665 --> 12:58.541
should learn that.

13:01.446 --> 13:03.579
Wow, look at that.

13:03.581 --> 13:06.415
That car just exploded
in front of those two girls,

13:06.417 --> 13:08.718
and one didn't use the other's body

13:08.720 --> 13:12.388
to block her from the flying debris.

13:12.390 --> 13:14.924
Are you ever gonna let this go?

13:14.926 --> 13:16.806
I don't know.
I mean, it's kind of a big deal.

13:16.807 --> 13:18.060
You put my life in danger.

13:18.062 --> 13:20.997
Well, I've apologized about it twice.

13:20.999 --> 13:22.565
I don't know how much more I can do.

13:25.503 --> 13:28.271
Yeah, I could have died,

13:28.273 --> 13:30.773
but you apologized twice,
so I guess we're good.

13:32.409 --> 13:33.409
I don't like this movie.

13:33.411 --> 13:35.411
It's violence against women.

13:35.413 --> 13:37.480
Let's go see that
Katherine Heigl rom-com sequel.

13:37.482 --> 13:40.750
Talk about violence against women.

13:40.752 --> 13:43.152
I am gonna go spend some time
with Katie Heigl.

13:43.154 --> 13:44.714
At least she won't make me feel guilty.

13:45.156 --> 13:46.289
See ya.

13:46.291 --> 13:50.259
Enjoy three <i>Walking On Sunshine</i> montages.

13:52.696 --> 13:55.298
I don't wanna go to a movie
by myself, and you're right.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.366
I'm sorry.
I hate the way I acted.

13:57.368 --> 14:00.202
I'm a spoiled rich girl,
and I always put myself first,

14:00.204 --> 14:02.204
and I know that's something
you would never do.

14:02.706 --> 14:04.273
Shut up.

14:05.809 --> 14:08.844
Max, I think I just saw Han.

14:09.346 --> 14:11.714
It is Han.
What's he doing here?

14:12.016 --> 14:13.696
Why is he sitting all the way in the back?

14:14.004 --> 14:15.244
I don't know, maybe he's afraid

14:15.245 --> 14:16.819
of blocking absolutely no one's view.

14:19.890 --> 14:22.124
And who is that guy and girl
he's sitting with?

14:22.626 --> 14:26.062
Is Han in a threesome?

14:26.064 --> 14:28.130
Does he secretly have game?

14:28.632 --> 14:30.232
Please.
The only game Han has

14:30.234 --> 14:32.301
is "One, two,
buckle my shoe."

14:34.237 --> 14:37.006
Wait, he's leaving,

14:37.008 --> 14:39.475
and so is the guy he was sitting next to.

14:39.977 --> 14:42.578
Did Han just get more interesting?

14:42.580 --> 14:44.980
We have to follow him.

14:46.182 --> 14:47.982
He can blast
a wall apart with his thoughts,

14:47.983 --> 14:49.343
but he can't get out of handcuffs?

14:49.344 --> 14:51.988
Even I could get out of handcuffs!

14:52.990 --> 14:54.557
Have fun being lied to.

14:54.559 --> 14:56.158
You're right.
You're always right.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.661
Are you seeing anyone?

14:58.663 --> 15:01.297
That was hard to watch.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.143
Why is he going to
the bathroom with that stranger?

15:12.145 --> 15:15.212
Is Han also a republican senator?

15:15.214 --> 15:17.448
Usher.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.824
Are all men's rooms this depressing?

15:26.826 --> 15:28.059
We are such different people.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.994
I was just gonna say how nice it is.

15:30.496 --> 15:33.030
I don't hear sex sounds,

15:33.032 --> 15:36.100
and he's not on the changing table,

15:36.102 --> 15:38.336
so maybe drugs are involved.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.738
You think Han's an Asian drug dealer?

15:40.740 --> 15:43.741
What's he selling, crystal math?

15:43.743 --> 15:45.076
Look.
Han's coming.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.877
- Aw, gross!
- No, no!

15:46.879 --> 15:51.282
I meant he's coming this way.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.118
Hey, you're running.
Don't run, it's Han.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.088
For him, every step we take
is like a 100-meter dash.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.890
Sorry, you're the one
who doesn't want Han to see us.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.052
I just don't want that kind
of relationship with him.

16:02.053 --> 16:03.373
You mean the kind of relationship

16:03.374 --> 16:04.574
where you see someone you know

16:04.575 --> 16:05.975
at the movie theater and say hello?

16:05.976 --> 16:07.431
Yeah, I definitely don't want that.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.202
Ladies, may I see your tickets, please?

16:11.204 --> 16:14.271
Tickets?
Max, do you...

16:16.241 --> 16:17.481
Can I see your tickets, please?

16:17.482 --> 16:20.077
I saw you go into another theater.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.546
Caroline?

16:22.548 --> 16:25.216
Hi, honey.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.118
Hello?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.986
Honey, I forgot my ticket.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.287
He has my ticket.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.156
Han, this nice usher man thinks I snuck

16:32.158 --> 16:34.725
into the theater,
so just show him the tickets.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.630
You two are together?

16:40.132 --> 16:42.333
- Yeah, why?
- It's nothing.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.567
It's none of my business,

16:43.569 --> 16:45.436
but he just seems too old for you.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.106
- He's 29.
- What?

16:49.108 --> 16:51.642
I'm gonna have to see you

16:51.644 --> 16:53.344
and your girlfriend's ticket.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.180
I thought I put the ticket in here.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.682
Tickets. You put two tickets
in there, honey.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.119
Okay.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.589
I cannot find it.
Damn.

17:05.590 --> 17:08.092
Sir, you know
that sneaking into a theater's

17:08.094 --> 17:09.160
a felony, right?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.695
It is?

17:13.832 --> 17:15.598
Han, what's that face?

17:15.601 --> 17:18.303
It's the same face I made when I peed...

17:19.305 --> 17:21.672
Honey.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.308
How will I live with the shame?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.976
Well, at least your fanny pack

17:25.978 --> 17:28.712
isn't the most embarrassing
thing about you any more.

17:35.887 --> 17:39.190
Well, well, well, look who it is.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.693
Hair flip and go.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.129
I don't know what you're
doing, but it feels weird.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.798
Now, look who's walk,
walk, walking with purpose

17:47.800 --> 17:50.000
away from me again.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.836
What?
It wasn't a big deal.

17:51.838 --> 17:55.239
Really? 'Cause I went
to movie jail with Han.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.341
- Cool.
- We have a mug shot.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.043
We're a notorious gangster couple now

17:59.045 --> 18:00.377
down at the Cineplex.

18:00.379 --> 18:03.214
That's right,
Han-nie and Clyde,

18:03.216 --> 18:04.748
but you know what, I'm fine.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.017
I'm thrilled, actually,
because you walking away

18:07.019 --> 18:08.419
gave me one thing.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.689
An obstructed view of my sweet, sweet ass?

18:11.691 --> 18:13.757
No, the satisfaction of knowing

18:13.759 --> 18:15.559
that you are just as selfish as me.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.695
What a selfish thing to say.

18:18.297 --> 18:21.392
You can walk, walk, walk away from me, Max,

18:21.393 --> 18:22.833
but you can't walk away from knowing

18:22.835 --> 18:24.101
that you split the scene.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.370
What? I thought you
were behind me,

18:26.372 --> 18:28.239
and besides, we couldn't both get caught.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.607
Who would live to tell the tale

18:29.609 --> 18:31.275
of the great Caroline Channing, the girl

18:31.277 --> 18:32.910
who couldn't walk fast enough?

18:32.912 --> 18:36.013
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't turn this around.

18:36.015 --> 18:38.449
Now, I see it, the whole "Max" of it all.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.184
When we got caught, you only thought

18:40.186 --> 18:41.785
about saving yourself,

18:41.787 --> 18:43.687
and you weren't defending poor Hallelujah.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.890
You just wanted fresh popcorn for yourself.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.025
What can I say?
I guess you're on to me.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.427
You said you'd take a bullet for me.

18:50.429 --> 18:52.029
You'd never take a bullet for me.

18:52.031 --> 18:54.565
Probably not.
No one ever takes a bullet.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.687
It's just something people say
that they don't mean,

18:56.688 --> 18:57.688
like, "how was your day?"

18:57.689 --> 19:00.504
Or, "we'll stop
if it hurts."

19:05.043 --> 19:07.411
Wow, so this is who we are,

19:07.413 --> 19:09.440
Two selfish girls who always put ourselves

19:09.441 --> 19:10.881
before everyone else and are willing

19:10.883 --> 19:12.216
to do anything to survive?

19:12.718 --> 19:14.285
Guess we are.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.620
Man, we're gonna crush
the cupcake competition.

19:17.122 --> 19:19.137
But, Max, even though we're ruthless,

19:19.138 --> 19:20.658
every now and then, on our own behalf,

19:20.660 --> 19:22.326
we do put ourselves second,

19:22.328 --> 19:24.962
and I guess that's
what makes us best friends.

19:25.714 --> 19:27.264
I don't think I've ever done that.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.465
Yes, you have.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.633
You let me stay on your couch

19:29.635 --> 19:31.468
when I had no place to stay.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.170
I guess I did.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.907
And I gave you...

19:36.909 --> 19:38.611
Go ahead.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.133
Well, there must be something
where I didn't put myself first.

19:43.134 --> 19:45.316
Let me know when you find it.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.754
Sophie, just look at you.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.957
You couldn't look more scrumptious.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.092
Maybe I could

19:55.094 --> 20:00.364
with a little chocolate drizzled on me.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.601
Good, there you are, Han.

20:03.603 --> 20:07.504
I just have one question
that I have to ask you.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.807
What is your favorite musical?

20:09.809 --> 20:12.343
Is it <i>The Wiz?</i>

20:13.846 --> 20:16.180
Whiz, Max!
I found another one, right?

20:17.883 --> 20:19.450
How do you even know about this?

20:19.452 --> 20:23.721
Oleg told me
while we were having phone sex.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.457
And by phone sex, she means
we were using the phone

20:26.459 --> 20:27.993
in the sex.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.528
Don't worry, Han.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.331
A lot of older men
can't control their bladder.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.867
I am twenty-freaking-nine!

20:36.869 --> 20:39.703
What?

20:44.010 --> 20:46.010
I'm humiliated, Max.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.312
Hey, listen to me.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.580
You didn't sell Caroline out.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.048
A lot of people would have,

20:51.050 --> 20:52.816
but you just stood there like a man

20:52.818 --> 20:54.318
and peed your pants.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.720
That's true.
I did.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.029
By the way, Han, why were you

20:58.030 --> 20:59.590
at the movies in the middle of the day?

20:59.892 --> 21:01.091
Sometimes people bug me,

21:01.093 --> 21:02.528
and I need some time away.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.929
You know what, Han?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.097
You're cool.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.399
We're gonna hang sometime.
