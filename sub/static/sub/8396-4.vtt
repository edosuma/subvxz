01:33.800 --> 01:34.880
What?

01:40.600 --> 01:41.640
Ian.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.360
Three victims in five weeks,
spread across London.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.520
Vics two and three have been
picked up on camera, heading home
alone after nights out.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.120
We don't know about Monica yet.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.920
The first victim died a month ago.
The second, two weeks later.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.880
The third, a week after that.
And now Monica five days later.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.080
Oh, he's escalating fast.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.080
This ain't just a serial...

02:02.080 --> 02:04.720
this man's on a murder spree.

02:04.720 --> 02:09.840
Three previous victims were found in
Isleworth, Whitton, West Drayfield.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.120
All of them were walking home alone.

02:12.120 --> 02:16.080
Now the dump sites are far
apart, but broadly similar,
near trading estates.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.160
So the Met think our man
may have been

02:18.160 --> 02:21.000
a delivery driver of some sort.
Hence White Van Man.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.240
The Met passed on data from
two thousand hours of CCTV footage,

02:24.240 --> 02:30.000
Tracked down and eliminated all vans
and other commercial vehicles within
a two-kilometre bulls-eye zone.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.280
Those who couldn't be eliminated
were added to the suspect pool.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.360
Tactical Unit 1,
under my command,

02:35.360 --> 02:37.560
will focus on last night's murder.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.640
Tactical Unit 2 will be based here
under the command of DCI Luther.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.840
You'll review
all existing case evidence

02:43.840 --> 02:45.800
pertaining to the previous victims.

02:45.800 --> 02:49.360
Focus on the suspect pool, eliminate
those unidentified vehicles.

02:49.360 --> 02:53.120
Our man is locked into a pattern
of rapid escalation.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.960
He's going to kill again, very soon,

02:54.960 --> 02:58.080
except we are going to catch him
before he gets the chance.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.800
You all right in here?
History of a case like this says

03:07.800 --> 03:10.600
he's in our database somewhere.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.280
We just have to prise him out.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.520
I'm sorry to bother you, Ma'am.
I thought it best.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.160
Is he fit enough to be questioned?

03:35.160 --> 03:39.320
Officially, it's too early to say.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.600
Unofficially?

03:41.600 --> 03:43.520
He's looking very good.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.640
Police arrested two kids yesterday.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.320
One was drinking battery acid,
the other was eating fireworks.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.560
They charged one
and let the other one off.

03:56.080 --> 04:00.560
Tommy Cooper. Boom, boom.

04:00.560 --> 04:06.600
It was Basil Brush that said,
boom, boom. Oops.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.240
Henry Madsen woke up.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.720
Are you in trouble? Possibly.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.240
Might be.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.600
Might be in trouble.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.320
I do know that I will
be put under surveillance.

04:26.320 --> 04:31.880
My movements, my phone calls...
everything. Why?

04:31.880 --> 04:35.840
I think they're worried that
I might sneak in and finish the job.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.680
Well, you might be mad,

04:41.680 --> 04:43.240
but you're not stupid.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.760
Yeah.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.920
I can't see you any more.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.640
I can't talk to you.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.880
Sorry.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.200
You know, I really am.

05:02.440 --> 05:06.160
But I can't do this any more,
not while this thing is hanging
over my head. It's over.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.320
No.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.440
Yes, Alice, it's over.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.840
I've got to go.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.680
Got work to do.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.240
No! Yes.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.760
No!

05:48.600 --> 05:50.840
Morning, love. Morning.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.080
Not yet! Dirty hands. Oh? Grease.

06:12.320 --> 06:17.040
You all right?
Yeah, yeah, just washing me hands.

06:19.840 --> 06:24.560
Textbook, after the first kill he
goes into the depressive phase.
He can't believe what he's done.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.720
Until the urge
becomes uncontrollable.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.280
The cooling off periods
get shorter and shorter,

06:29.280 --> 06:32.240
but not this quickly,
so what's driving the escalation?

06:32.240 --> 06:34.720
Do you have any sexual fantasies?

06:34.720 --> 06:38.440
What? Yeah, none that
I'm going to tell you about.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.360
Does the reality ever
live up to the fantasy?

06:41.360 --> 06:43.320
I erm...

06:43.320 --> 06:45.600
Well, no.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.480
No, not really. It can't can it?

06:47.480 --> 06:49.880
That doesn't account
for the pace of escalation.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.160
No, no. But we're not
looking at a release, here.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.760
we're looking at an explosion.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.080
You know.
What makes a man just let go?

06:56.080 --> 07:00.240
The trigger event is usually some
kind of perceived humiliation.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.120
You know, loss of a job,
or a spouse.

07:02.120 --> 07:06.400

I've got to take this.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.760
You OK? I'm great.

07:17.760 --> 07:22.240
Well, I've never had an affair
before. So, I don't know what to do.

'Is it still called an affair

07:24.320 --> 07:28.080

wife behind her lover's back?'

Coffee's on.

You're up early.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.920
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

Gray? You home, love? Yeah. In here.

08:19.880 --> 08:24.600
Happy birthday. Gray.
I thought you'd forgotten.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.840
Of course I haven't, no.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.120
No, no, never. Come on, sit...

Er, yeah, coke please, mate.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.120
Same again everyone, yeah?

10:54.680 --> 10:57.760
There you go, madam.
Thank you. Enjoy.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.920
So did you you get
anything nice for your b-day?

11:00.920 --> 11:03.240
Erm, yeah I got this,
he got me a necklace.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.920
I thought he'd forgotten.

11:05.920 --> 11:11.200
When did he give it to you? Just, er,
well just before I come out, which
is why I thought he'd forgotten.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.640
I didn't get anything this morning.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.920
What's all this?
Decoupage. The cut-up technique.

11:52.920 --> 11:57.600
Take a bit of text, cut it up
randomise it, make new text.

11:57.600 --> 12:02.080
See new patterns. Where'd you
learn this? David Bowie.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.040
It's how he wrote his lyrics.
You a fan?

12:05.040 --> 12:08.000
Don't I look like a fan? What of
songs about like aliens and that?

12:08.000 --> 12:11.240
No there's a bit more to him
than aliens. I'll make you a tape.

12:11.240 --> 12:16.440
A what, sorry? Ah.
You've gone all David Bowie on us.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.160
Yeah, cause of death confirmed.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.280
He chokes them.

12:20.280 --> 12:24.840
No forensics to speak of,
no witnesses. I spent the day
interviewing the family.

12:24.840 --> 12:29.120
There's mother, one sister,
one boyfriend, long term.
Is he on the list?

12:29.120 --> 12:30.920
No he was pulling a night-shift.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.120
I took him through the inventory,
the stuff our man left around her.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.000
Anything missing? Yeah, necklace.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.920
Some of these guys keep
news clippings, photographs.

12:38.920 --> 12:43.680
The fact that it's jewellery?
Suggests that he's married,
in a relationship.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.080
He'd give the necklace
to his wife, girlfriend.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.000
Every time he sees it,
he's taken back to the kill.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.800
But the suddenness of it?
What sets him off like that?

12:51.800 --> 12:53.560
She's about to leave him.

12:53.560 --> 12:57.680
So it just pushes him over the edge.
We don't need insight into his

12:57.680 --> 13:00.400
tortured soul
to understand who he is.

13:00.400 --> 13:05.200
We just need to know, who the hell
he is and where the hell he's at.

13:27.080 --> 13:31.760
Oh, no, really, really
I'm really shocked, is that
meant to be me, charming.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.800
It's got your eyes, it's lovely.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.640
Sorry, love.
Listen, I've got to go to work!

13:53.640 --> 13:56.280
That's all right, don't worry.
Happy birthday!

13:56.280 --> 13:57.800
You enjoy yourself!

14:01.240 --> 14:04.880
Look after her for me, mate, won't
ya? Make sure she has a good time!

14:04.880 --> 14:08.040
Will do mate, yeah.
Sorry we were running a bit
late tonight, mate.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.080
But, er, I had to give
her one for her birthday.

14:11.080 --> 14:15.480
You know how she likes it,
good and hard and long.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.480
Tell you the truth,

14:17.480 --> 14:20.760
I'm surprised she can walk.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.560
See you later. Yeah, see you later.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.680
So why was she walking
home by herself?

14:52.680 --> 14:56.000
She was meeting friends in the pub
to talk about the hen night.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.520
She's happy,
she's engaged, she's on home turf.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.280
She's not about to get into
a white van with Jack the Lad.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.960
Blitz attack. He jumps out,
drags her into the van.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.680
There was no screams,
no sign of any altercation.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.920
She trusted him.
He knows her, maybe?

15:09.920 --> 15:12.640
He can't have known
all four of them. No he didn't.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.240
But they trusted him.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.280
They trusted him.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.200
I think we're looking
for a taxi driver.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.840
Luther.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.600
Luther.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.360
Luther!

17:00.440 --> 17:01.520
What's wrong?

17:04.599 --> 17:06.720
Henry Madsen is talking.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.920
The doctors won't let us
anywhere near him, not yet.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.560
So right now, anything says means
nothing. It's inadmissible. Hearsay.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.160
Guv, what's he saying?

17:18.160 --> 17:19.599
Your name.

17:22.560 --> 17:23.880
Right, OK.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.040
OK.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.840
Ten minutes ago we got this.

17:30.840 --> 17:34.880
This is the south end of Broughton
Row. It's the closest to our hit.

17:34.880 --> 17:38.520
Is that her? Yeah we think it's her.
Tell me we got the number plate.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.720
Number plate. Driver's name,
home address, phone number.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.200
Just triangulating the mobile
phone signal now.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.840
We've got him locked on.
Good. So...

17:47.840 --> 17:49.840
Go, go!

18:15.800 --> 18:17.240
Hey, love!

18:17.240 --> 18:19.840
I don't need a cab, thanks.
I don't live that far.

18:19.840 --> 18:23.240
It's not that. It's just come over
the radio, some girl's been attacked

18:23.240 --> 18:26.560
just down the road,
just past Holywell Avenue.
Oh, you're joking.

18:26.560 --> 18:30.560
He got away before he could
do too much, but they've warned us
to keep an eye out.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.440
I had to stop and tell you
love, they make us do it.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.640
Yeah. You sure you'll be all right?

18:35.640 --> 18:37.960
Yeah. It's not far.
Where do you live?

18:37.960 --> 18:42.680
Erm, Lacey Road? Just down that way?
That's past Holywell, innit?

18:42.680 --> 18:46.360
Listen, I'd hate it if my girl had to
walk home alone, this time of night,

18:46.360 --> 18:49.440
with all this going on. Hop in.
I can't. I haven't got any...

18:49.440 --> 18:52.360
Forget the money.
We'll just get you home safely.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.360
Come Christmas, give five quid
to the dog's home for me.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.440
Are you sure? Get in.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.160
Come on.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.920
Got you.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.160
SIRENS BLARE

19:55.160 --> 19:58.120
Police, step out the vehicle.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.880
Trevor Rowan, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

20:01.880 --> 20:06.920
You do not have to say anything or
to mention when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.480
I haven't done anything!
It's all right, love.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.720
Excuse me.

20:14.720 --> 20:18.600
Excuse me, I think
you missed a turn back there,

20:18.600 --> 20:21.200
that was my street, Lacey Road?

20:21.200 --> 20:24.040
Excuse me.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.840
Excuse me!

20:44.880 --> 20:46.400
What's wrong?

20:48.800 --> 20:50.960
Just that you said he was impotent.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.280
He is.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.800
Well, he was.

20:58.320 --> 21:01.920
I don't know, It's come back.
The last few weeks, it's come back.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.080
I hate it.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.040
Do we have to talk about this?

21:19.920 --> 21:22.160
When I'm here, can't I just be here?

21:22.160 --> 21:24.000
He knows, don't he?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.480
About me and you?
He absolutely knows.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.040
SHE SOBS

21:47.040 --> 21:51.160
Hey, babe, please.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.160
No.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.240
Oh...

22:31.720 --> 22:35.600
You all right? Me? Hmm.

22:37.560 --> 22:40.600
Yeah, I'm good. I'm great!

22:40.600 --> 22:43.920
Why?
Oh, no reason, you just seemed...

22:46.440 --> 22:52.520
You sure? Yeah, I'm sure.

22:57.120 --> 23:02.320
# Search your heart
search your soul

23:02.320 --> 23:05.200
# And when you find me there

23:05.200 --> 23:08.240
# You'll search no more

23:08.240 --> 23:10.120
# Don't tell me... #

23:10.120 --> 23:13.240
Stop. What? Stop.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.120
# ..it's not worth fighting for... #

23:15.120 --> 23:17.320
I hate that song.
You love it, you love it.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.680
I hate it. You love it. Help!

23:35.920 --> 23:37.920
'Hello, you are through
to Zoe Luther.

23:37.920 --> 23:41.120
'Please leave me a message after
the tone and I'll get back...'

23:41.120 --> 23:44.920
His alibi sticks.

23:44.920 --> 23:49.400
He was on Eccleston Road, SW1.

23:49.400 --> 23:53.640
He's not our man. So there are two
taxis with the same number-plate

23:53.640 --> 23:55.400
on the same night in London?

23:55.400 --> 23:59.280
Yeah, no he just cloned them.
It's easy to do, you know.

23:59.280 --> 24:03.040
So what do we have?
Well, we have this...

24:03.040 --> 24:09.240
He attempts to make a turn,
at the end of Broughton Row,
messes up, does a U-turn.

24:09.240 --> 24:13.520
So we checked it out and it
turns out that Broughton Row
used to be a through-way.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.960
But when the hookers moved in, they
locked it off and made it a rat-run.

24:16.960 --> 24:20.000
This was when? March, er, 2002.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.560
The implication being? Well, I
don't think he's a real taxi driver.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.240
He tried to be one,
or used to be one but...

24:26.240 --> 24:28.280
KNOCK AT DOOR
Yeah.

24:28.280 --> 24:32.360
Not only is there no law
against selling second-hand taxis,
it's easy and cheap.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.160
How many people are
out in these things?

24:34.160 --> 24:36.960
There's no database. But it runs
into the early thousands.

24:36.960 --> 24:40.680
God. It's more than you want to
think about, let alone track down.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.560
He could have a different
plate for every night of the month.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.720
He's completely anonymous.
One taxi and 20,000 others.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.400
Trusted by default.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.440
He might as well be invisible.

24:54.440 --> 24:58.360
Yeah, and he's on a feeding frenzy.

24:58.360 --> 25:02.000
There'll be another body tomorrow.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.960
And another...

25:03.960 --> 25:05.840
and another.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.600
PHONE RINGS
Teller.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.920
Chartwell Hospital's on fire.

25:56.600 --> 26:00.800
ALARM BEEPS
Excuse me, sorry.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.400
Sorry, excuse me, thank you.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.520
Er, Officer? Fulford.

26:05.520 --> 26:09.240
We're having some trouble with a few
members of the public on ward 28.
SHOUTING

26:09.240 --> 26:12.040
They're refusing to leave the
building. Response is on its way

26:12.040 --> 26:14.200
but since you're here... I'm not
supposed to...

26:14.200 --> 26:18.120
I wouldn't ask if I didn't think it
was an emergency. I'll wait with the
patient.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.320
Ward 28? Next floor down.

26:32.720 --> 26:36.440
MACHINES BEEP

27:02.680 --> 27:04.960
(Don't say his name.)

27:22.520 --> 27:24.920
Cabbies who've been sacked,
invalided off, retired,

27:24.920 --> 27:27.600
plus a list of drivers who've
tried and failed the Knowledge

27:27.600 --> 27:31.440
over the last 20 years,
triangulated, cross-referenced
with the suspect pool.

27:31.440 --> 27:32.640
Best?

27:32.640 --> 27:34.440
Left with 23 names.

27:34.440 --> 27:39.800
Sergeant Ripley, would you
mind if I borrowed Detective
Chief Inspector for a moment?

27:39.800 --> 27:42.800
Um...no. No, Sir.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.040
Stressful day.

27:48.040 --> 27:53.440
Oh, five victims dead,
possibly another in 12 hours.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.560
Henry Madsen passed away.

27:58.120 --> 28:03.800
I'm sorry? It could be fluke,
unconnected with the fire.

28:03.800 --> 28:11.040
But, the fire was arson and these
two events, co-occurring.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.800
Madsen had a permanent guard.

28:13.800 --> 28:17.760
Who was directed away from
his post by some doctor.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.560
What doctor?

28:19.560 --> 28:26.880
HE SCOFFS
Well, quite. Young, very pretty,
dark-haired and heterochromatic.

28:26.880 --> 28:30.360
Heterowhat? I'm sorry?

28:30.360 --> 28:33.600
Different coloured eyes.
Like David Bowie.

28:33.600 --> 28:38.960
But no doctor with heterochromia
of the eye is currently employed
by the Chartwell hospital.

28:38.960 --> 28:42.040
Well, I don't know, some doctor
lost a contact lens, perhaps?

28:42.040 --> 28:44.800
Probably?

28:44.800 --> 28:48.840
But if not...
If somebody is impersonating,

28:48.840 --> 28:54.760
posing as a doctor, someone who
wants access to Henry Madsen.

28:54.760 --> 28:59.400
would you have any notion of who
that might be?

29:00.760 --> 29:05.200
I could think off 100 people
that would want to see him dead.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.400
But I'd start off with
the parents of the victims.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.720
Yes, of course.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.680
HE SIGHS

29:13.480 --> 29:19.640
But the timing you see, the timing,
it, it chafes my brain.

29:19.640 --> 29:26.040
Why now? Why today...the day after
he wakes up?

29:26.040 --> 29:32.400
I don't know, Martin. We'll just
have to put that down to a
big...mystery.

29:34.560 --> 29:38.520
Well, I can see you're busy.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.560
PHONE RINGS

29:48.000 --> 29:50.680
Hello? Don't worry about
the call being traced.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.720
This is a disposable phone.
One conversation,

29:53.720 --> 29:56.840
I wipe it and it goes into
someone else's garbage.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.320
Listen to me, I think I told you
that I don't want to speak to you.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.600
Not today, not tomorrow.
Not EVER again.

30:02.600 --> 30:07.320
Well, there's a remarkable
absence of gratitude for you.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.880
Do you know, what you've done?

30:09.880 --> 30:12.360
Given you back your wife.
Saved your job.

30:12.360 --> 30:15.000
Saved you from
disgrace and imprisonment.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.760
No, you've committed murder.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.840
All I did was finish
the job you started.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.400
What are you going to do, arrest me?

30:22.400 --> 30:27.200
Yes! I have to!
Shall I articulate why you won't?

30:27.200 --> 30:31.080
Stop! You made me do it,
you threatened me. There's phone
traffic between us to prove it,

30:31.080 --> 30:33.880
including the call I'm making
from this phone. Empty threats.

30:33.880 --> 30:37.560
You implicate me, you implicate
yourself and you're too in love
with your own genius for that.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.040
Conspiracy to murder will
just be the start of it...

30:40.040 --> 30:43.160
I can send you to hell. You'll
burn for the rest of your life.

30:43.160 --> 30:46.800
Which is why I would appreciate,
some, gratitude!

30:46.800 --> 30:53.040
I did it for you! Pig! Filth!
I did it for you!

30:53.040 --> 30:54.720
I want you to stay away!

30:54.720 --> 30:57.640
Understand, stay away from me!
Stay away from my life!

30:57.640 --> 30:59.920
Stay a fucking way! Do you hear me!

31:19.040 --> 31:22.480
What can I do for you, Martin?
Busy day here.

31:22.480 --> 31:27.280
I'd like John Luther's
phone and email records, please.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.560
Go away. I can't.

31:30.560 --> 31:33.480
Whatever you're here to
tell me, I don't want to hear it.

31:33.480 --> 31:36.080
So do us a favour,
get yourself an exorcist. I see.

31:36.080 --> 31:38.520
You already know.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.600
Know what? Zoe's been LYING to you.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.240
No, no, no.
I don't want to hear it.

31:42.240 --> 31:45.120
All right, I want you out of my
way, I want you out of my life.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.240
Hah, yes, I've been hearing that a
lot today. I wish I could help you.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.280
But I can't. So I would like
you please, to stay away.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.600
You are completely... Right.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.000
KNOCK ON DOOR

32:08.000 --> 32:09.360
You all right, boss?

32:09.360 --> 32:14.720
It was the wife. Ex wife. Come in.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.480
Erm, those suspects...

32:19.480 --> 32:22.200
Have you eaten?
What are you, my nan?

32:24.120 --> 32:28.440
Best hit, Graham Shand drinking in
the same pub as victim number one.

32:28.440 --> 32:31.200
Failed the Knowledge three
times, the last time in 2002.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.720
Until six weeks ago, he worked
nights at a taxi breakdown and

32:33.720 --> 32:36.040
recovery garage.
Formerly decent employee.

32:36.040 --> 32:40.360
Seems to have undergone some
kind of breakdown - drinking,
sexually inappropriate conduct.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.920
Erm, got one. Erm, any hard evidence?

32:44.920 --> 32:50.160
No, none. No record of him,
his wife, known friends or family
ever buying a second-hand taxi.

32:50.160 --> 32:54.200
But he's had plenty of
opportunity to buy one, under
the table, cash in hand, eh?

32:54.200 --> 32:56.360
Form? Er, none.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.320
I'll get DCI Reed to the house with
a warrant.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.360
What will we do if he's
not there? Get him in his weak spot.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.720
What's that?
The wife. Always the wife.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.400
Check her out, bring her in.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.200
Nice work.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.800
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

33:17.800 --> 33:20.400
So what's
happening with you and Zoe?

33:20.400 --> 33:23.480
That was her on the
phone just now, right?

33:23.480 --> 33:28.240
Yes, it was Zoe.
So are you and she? No.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.040
Yes. Possibly.

33:31.040 --> 33:35.120
I don't know.
It's nice to see you're happy for me.

33:35.120 --> 33:37.880
You want to know the real
tragedy about marriage?

33:37.880 --> 33:41.400
No, thanks. Women always think
men will change, but they don't.

33:41.400 --> 33:46.600
Men think women won't change but
they do. Where d'you get that from?
A fortune cookie? Hmm.

33:46.600 --> 33:49.840
I need you to stay in this building
until you're cleared to leave.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.560
I'm trying to run an
investigation, here.

33:52.560 --> 33:57.480
Yeah and like you say this is
the best place to run it from. So,
just do that.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.440
HE SIGHS

34:05.360 --> 34:06.920
No-one.

34:10.159 --> 34:15.239
No-one's home... Yeah, bye.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.440
All right? We're shut.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.080
Linda Shand? Yeah?

34:23.080 --> 34:27.040
Mrs Shand, I'm Detective Sergeant
Ripley... All right, hang on. Who,
sorry?

34:27.040 --> 34:29.760
Detective Sergeant Ripley of the
Serious Crime Unit, Hobb Lane.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.159
I wonder if you'd come with me, help
clear up a few things.

34:32.159 --> 34:36.560
What sort of thing?
Probably it's nothing we just need
you to answer a few questions.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.639
About what?

34:38.639 --> 34:42.120
Graham, mostly. 
Oh, my God.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.960
Has he done...
Has he done something?

34:43.960 --> 34:45.800
If you'd like to come with me?

34:47.320 --> 34:49.760
Oh, I feel sick. Can I just?

34:49.760 --> 34:51.280
Yeah, course.

34:59.840 --> 35:04.200
Linda? What's going on? What do you
mean? The police are here.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.960
What do they want? I don't know!

35:05.960 --> 35:08.600
Well, did they mention me?
What did you do?!

35:08.600 --> 35:11.320
What did they say?
Have you been stealing again?

35:11.320 --> 35:12.840
No, of course I haven't! No!

35:12.840 --> 35:15.360
Then what have you done, Graham?

35:15.360 --> 35:18.520
Well, what did they say?
They must have said something!
What did they say?!

35:18.520 --> 35:21.040
SHE CRIES
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.880
God!
HE SOBS

35:24.880 --> 35:28.440
HE SOBS AND SHOUTS

35:29.840 --> 35:34.760
Not yet, not yet, not yet...
HE SOBS AND SHOUTS

35:37.480 --> 35:39.960
HE SOBS

35:49.480 --> 35:53.400
We don't have any other room, so
I have to use the interview room.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.280
Can I get you a drink or anything?

35:55.280 --> 35:58.640
Er yes, some water.
You want some water?

36:11.120 --> 36:13.680
Here you go.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.520
So how are things with you
and your husband?

36:25.040 --> 36:27.840
Fine. Why?

36:27.840 --> 36:30.440
Do you know where
he was Friday night?

36:30.440 --> 36:33.240
Yeah, at the pub.
With me and some friends.

36:33.240 --> 36:34.880
It was my birthday.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.800
Was he with you all night?

36:37.800 --> 36:40.560
Not all night, no.
Cause he, he went to work.

36:40.560 --> 36:44.080
Work where? He works at an
all night recovery garage.

36:44.080 --> 36:49.600
The thing is Linda, Graham hasn't
worked there for two months now.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.080
You didn't know?

36:53.080 --> 36:55.520
KNOCK ON DOOR

36:55.520 --> 36:58.040
Boss? I'm sorry to interrupt...
it's a bit urgent. Right now.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.600
I'm afraid it can't wait sir,
sorry.

36:59.600 --> 37:05.160
Linda, you have to excuse me?
Erm, I've got to dash. I'll come back
and we'll finish talking, all right?

37:05.160 --> 37:06.880
Sorry, talk about what, I...
SHE SOBS

37:06.880 --> 37:09.960
Soon as I get back, we'll talk,
all right, sorry.

37:13.280 --> 37:17.040
I time that all right?
Perfect. How is she?

37:17.040 --> 37:18.920
Well, she knows
something's not right.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.960
No.

37:30.960 --> 37:35.440
You don't think this
approach is a bit merciless? No.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.360
SHE CRIES

37:45.360 --> 37:48.080
Graham knows we're on to him.

37:48.080 --> 37:51.880
All right, and he'll try and kill as
many as he can before we catch him.

37:51.880 --> 37:56.040
And if I have to terrify his
wife to stop that happening,
I can live with that.

37:56.040 --> 38:00.320
Thus spoke John Luther,
gentleman of the parish.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.600
SHE SOBS

38:06.600 --> 38:09.640
She knows what her husband is.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.920
Yeah, but maybe not what he's done.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.440
There is a difference.

38:13.440 --> 38:18.360
SHE GASPS AND SOBS

38:29.800 --> 38:32.000
SHE SOBS

38:35.160 --> 38:41.000
No, no...
SHE CRIES UNCONTROLLABLY

38:46.920 --> 38:49.440
No, no, what is this?

38:49.440 --> 38:51.320
What, what is that?

38:51.320 --> 38:53.280
What is that?

38:53.280 --> 38:56.200
What... what... Linda?
SHE CRIES

38:56.200 --> 39:01.600
No, get it off me. What is that,
what is that?
Oh, my God, oh, my God, no, no...

39:01.600 --> 39:07.320
No, no, my God, no, no...
SOBS UNCONTROLLABLY

39:07.320 --> 39:13.880
Oh, no, oh, my god,
oh, my god. What did he do?

39:13.880 --> 39:16.280
What did he do? Oh, god...

39:19.400 --> 39:21.400
It's all right.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.920
Is there a glass for me? Of course.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.040
OK.

39:50.040 --> 39:54.120
I have something I
need, I need to say to, um...

39:54.120 --> 39:56.440
to tell you.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.640
You already know.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.880
Yeah, pretty much. How?

40:04.880 --> 40:09.440
Well, it hardly takes an intuitive
genius, does it?

40:10.960 --> 40:12.920
Well, why didn't you say something?

40:12.920 --> 40:14.640
Perhaps it's none of my business.

40:16.840 --> 40:20.360
Of course it's your business!
Don't say that.

40:20.360 --> 40:21.880
Please...

40:26.440 --> 40:28.800
It's absolutely your business!

40:28.800 --> 40:33.040
Look, erm, look for what it's
worth... Oh, Mark!

40:33.040 --> 40:36.880
But seriously, this is what I think
you should...

40:36.880 --> 40:41.480
You should make a list
of the reasons why you married him.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.480
And then make another list of
the reasons why you left him.

40:44.480 --> 40:47.480
And then see if
the two lists don't overlap.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.520
SHE SOBS
I'm so sorry.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.840
He's not what I want.
He's just not.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.920
Well, what do you want?

41:10.600 --> 41:14.480
This. Here.

41:16.480 --> 41:18.480
Right now, with you.

41:39.720 --> 41:46.200
You all right? I can't... Er, I know,
I know.

41:49.720 --> 41:52.440
It's all right, OK. What's he done?
SHE SOBS

41:53.680 --> 41:58.440
Hey, Linda, do you mind if we keep
talking?

41:59.680 --> 42:02.120
Yeah?

42:05.320 --> 42:09.000
Linda, how long
have you been married?

42:09.000 --> 42:11.680
Er...
SHE GASPS

42:11.680 --> 42:15.800
Erm...20 years.

42:17.520 --> 42:20.000
He said if I ever left
him, he'd kill himself.

42:21.520 --> 42:25.560
And, er, I tried, once.

42:25.560 --> 42:29.440
Erm, I packed my bags and
bought a ticket to Cardiff.

42:29.440 --> 42:33.680
And he slashed his wrists in
the bath and he called me
before he called the ambulance.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.840
He didn't even do it properly,

42:35.840 --> 42:38.480
he just sliced at his wrists.

42:40.240 --> 42:44.560
There was lots of blood, lots of
drama, but no real risk to Graham.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.920
Which is the story of his life.

42:52.320 --> 42:55.960
I'm going to ask you some really

42:55.960 --> 42:58.040
difficult

42:58.040 --> 43:03.560
and personal questions. My intentions
are not to embarrass you, OK?

43:03.560 --> 43:06.040
Is it about the handbags?

43:07.520 --> 43:13.680
Yes, yeah...why don't you tell me
about the handbags.

43:15.880 --> 43:19.800
Early on...we must have been married
a year, 18 months...

43:22.320 --> 43:24.120
He used to nick them.

43:24.120 --> 43:27.800
And, er,
and I confronted him and he,

43:27.800 --> 43:32.120
he cried and he made up some story.

43:32.120 --> 43:33.640
You reported him?

43:36.920 --> 43:40.760
No. Why?

43:40.760 --> 43:43.120
'Cause he's my husband.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.360
What did you think he was
doing with the hand bags?

43:49.520 --> 43:55.040
He used to, erm...sniff them and,

43:55.040 --> 43:57.240
er, touch himself.

43:57.240 --> 44:00.960
I was embarrassed.

44:00.960 --> 44:03.000
And a bit of me thought it was...

44:04.920 --> 44:08.040
A bit of me was scared it was me...

44:08.040 --> 44:11.120
That I was doing something wrong
and that, er,

44:11.120 --> 44:16.240
somehow, y'know, people would
find out and, and they'd laugh.

44:17.880 --> 44:21.960
Look, Linda I have to tell you Graham
is involved in a very serious crime.

44:21.960 --> 44:26.560
And these urges,
these urges, that he's had,
he's controlled them for a while.

44:26.560 --> 44:29.160
Until suddenly...

44:29.160 --> 44:31.360
This.

44:31.360 --> 44:33.280
He's been murdering young women.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.200
It's not my fault.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.920
What, what's not your fault?

44:39.920 --> 44:42.760
What do you mean by that?

44:42.760 --> 44:47.560
Linda? Hey, hey look at me.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.240
What's not your fault?

44:53.400 --> 44:55.720
I forgot to erase a text message.

44:55.720 --> 44:59.160
He checks my phone,
when I'm in the shower.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.760
He goes down my handbag.

45:01.760 --> 45:06.320
He checks your phone and, and found
out you were
sleeping with someone?

45:09.320 --> 45:11.320
Who is he, Linda?

45:12.320 --> 45:14.040
It's not my fault.

45:14.040 --> 45:16.440
You need to tell me his name.

45:28.240 --> 45:31.960
Right here it is,
Dennis Keaton, 23 Black Swan Way.

45:31.960 --> 45:33.760
Call him, tell him
to keep himself safe.

45:33.760 --> 45:35.800
Graham is punishing her
for being unfaithful.

45:35.800 --> 45:40.080
He's working his way to killing her.
Can't do it now, 'cause we have her.
He's going for the next best thing.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.120
KNOCK ON DOOR

45:47.000 --> 45:48.160

SHOUTING AND GROANING

45:53.280 --> 45:56.320
Straight to answer phone. Guv?

45:56.320 --> 45:59.400
Er, what was the last
number called from his house?

45:59.400 --> 46:03.800
The last number from a Dennis
Keaton is, City Chic Escorts.

46:03.800 --> 46:06.280
Oh, no, no, has he done it before?

46:06.280 --> 46:11.200
No. Dennis Keaton is dead.

46:11.200 --> 46:14.280
Get me the number of
the hooker that's going there,

46:14.280 --> 46:15.880
put them on speaker for me.

46:15.880 --> 46:18.760
MOBILE RINGS

46:18.760 --> 46:21.040

46:29.720 --> 46:33.440
Oh, hang on a sec. What?
Text message from a Layla.

46:33.440 --> 46:36.440
"Safe arrival,
23 Black Swan Way." Oh, no.

46:36.440 --> 46:39.000
Let me see if I can get Reed on the
speaker.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.320
Come on, Layla, pick up the phone.

46:43.720 --> 46:46.000
I'm almost there.
Two, three minutes max.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.600
She's already there.
She's an escort, her name's Layla.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.880
Can't kick the door down.
He'll kill her.

46:50.880 --> 46:52.520
What do you suggest?

46:52.520 --> 46:54.720
I got to be there, boss.

46:54.720 --> 46:57.040
Come on I've got to go! No.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.640
How quickly can you get there?

47:00.640 --> 47:04.040
Just tell me what to do and it's
done. Ian, I'm sending Ripley.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.800
Take Linda.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.120
We'll go for that weak spot.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.400
KNOCK ON DOOR

47:22.680 --> 47:28.760
Dennis, is it? Absolutely.
It's lovely to meet you, Dennis.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.280
I'm Layla.

47:31.320 --> 47:34.440
May I? Yeah.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.760
Well?

47:50.760 --> 47:54.760
Yeah...yeah.

47:54.760 --> 47:57.200
So, do we, er? Absolutely.

47:57.200 --> 47:58.920
You're the boss.

47:58.920 --> 48:00.560
But first...

48:02.720 --> 48:05.360
Oh, right, yeah, erm...

48:06.880 --> 48:10.520
225. You're very kind.

48:10.520 --> 48:13.880
So, would you like to
show me where you want me.

48:13.880 --> 48:16.720
Upstairs, if that's OK?

48:16.720 --> 48:18.480
That's absolutely fine.

MOBILE RINGS

48:30.480 --> 48:33.280
Dennis, it's my girlfriend.

48:33.280 --> 48:37.000
She likes to check up on me during
dates to make sure I arrive safely.
Do you mind?

48:37.000 --> 48:40.120
No, of course not. Go ahead.
Hello, darling.

48:40.120 --> 48:43.800
Layla, this is Chief Inspector John
Luther. I need you to listen to me

48:43.800 --> 48:47.640
very carefully keep smiling and act
like this is the agency calling you.

48:47.640 --> 48:51.920
Yeah, yeah I got here quite safely.

48:51.920 --> 48:56.880
Right, excellent. OK, can you get out
of the house safely?

48:56.880 --> 49:01.480
Not really, not right now, love.

49:01.480 --> 49:06.040
Listen to me. I need you to get to a
safe place and
just wait for us, we're on our way.

49:06.040 --> 49:08.920
I will. Stop worrying, silly.

49:18.800 --> 49:21.480
Honestly.

49:21.480 --> 49:24.000
Anyway.

49:25.960 --> 49:28.200
Second door on the right.

50:07.080 --> 50:09.520
SHE GASPS

50:32.800 --> 50:34.680

50:36.400 --> 50:38.320
Of course.

What?

51:03.280 --> 51:05.080

I just want to kiss you.

53:30.480 --> 53:36.240
Do you know what I'm
going to do to you?
LINDA: Graham?

53:36.240 --> 53:39.920
Gray? Are you here?

53:44.880 --> 53:47.600
Graham, are you here?!

54:03.800 --> 54:06.400
See?

54:06.400 --> 54:09.240
Look at you.

54:09.240 --> 54:12.200
You sad little prick!

54:15.280 --> 54:20.480
Put the hammer down, Graham.
You're all done.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.960
Now, just put it down, all right?

54:23.960 --> 54:26.120
I'm tired, I want to go home.

I, er,
I've just called you 100 times.

57:23.720 --> 57:26.400
I know it's difficult.

57:28.240 --> 57:31.280
Just want to hear your voice.

57:40.320 --> 57:42.160
# Change your heart

# Change your heart

57:59.320 --> 58:01.520
# It will astound you... #

58:01.520 --> 58:04.800
It's just been a way of
saying goodbye properly.

58:07.480 --> 58:11.480
# I need your loving... #

58:11.480 --> 58:13.240
There is love in the world.

sometime... #

It's not my fault! It's not my
fault!

58:26.560 --> 58:29.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
# Everybody's gotta learn
sometime... #

58:36.040 --> 58:39.360
All I need you to do is give me
those diamonds. I don't have them.
