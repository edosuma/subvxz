WEBVTT

00:03.469 --> 00:05.643
You ruined my life, Olivette.

00:08.308 --> 00:11.221
- Is that her?
- Poetic justice, if you ask me.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.546
The Styne family.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.690
They've been after me since
I dug up the Book of the Damned.

00:14.882 --> 00:17.886
All the spells they used came from
a book of unspeakable evil.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.361
My family will never stop
looking for that book.

00:22.222 --> 00:25.897
You've got to figure a way
to get the Mark of Cain off Dean...

00:26.159 --> 00:30.073
...before it turns him back into a demon.
- There is a cure for the Mark in the book.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.403
It comes at a price.
We've got to destroy it.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.486
Going behind his back ain't the best idea.

00:34.601 --> 00:37.013
- Sam. Burn it, now.
- And I know it's the life...

00:37.170 --> 00:39.741
...doing a little bad
so you can do a lot of good.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.011
Will you help me?

00:41.208 --> 00:43.848
Sometimes the bad's real bad.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.719
And the good,
it can come at one hell of a price.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.919
- Kill my son.
- I'll kill Crowley.

00:51.084 --> 00:53.860
- Can you read the book?
- Bring me Nadya's Codex...

00:54.021 --> 00:56.058
...and I'll give you your cure.

00:56.223 --> 01:00.069
- We had an agreement.
- You want out? Hurry up.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.788
Ah, you must be Eileen.

01:21.949 --> 01:26.227
Yes, I'm here for the interview. Thank you
so much for fitting me in after hours.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.133
As you can see, I'm in good health...

01:31.325 --> 01:34.636
...and my eyesight is 20/20,
which is important, yes?

01:35.128 --> 01:37.631
Because this is a research study
on eyesight?

01:38.165 --> 01:39.838
Mm-hm.

01:42.402 --> 01:45.076
My friends and I do as many
of these studies as we can...

01:45.272 --> 01:47.149
...because we're all on budgets...

01:47.341 --> 01:49.651
...and the money from these
helps with college.

01:50.243 --> 01:54.316
- Okay, everything seems to be in order.
- Okay.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.792
Let's take a peek at these eyes.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.825
Okay.

02:24.611 --> 02:28.024
No, no. No! No!

02:54.508 --> 02:55.714
Everything okay in there?

02:57.978 --> 02:59.013
What's going on?

03:00.213 --> 03:01.214
Everything okay?

03:02.215 --> 03:03.421
Hey.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.866
Wait, nothing? You've got nothing?

03:42.923 --> 03:44.869
Rowena, it's been days.

03:45.025 --> 03:49.303
- You said the Codex would crack the code.
- I am an artist, Samuel.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.773
These things cannot be rushed.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.406
Perhaps if I weren't chained up.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.777
- I'm not at full strength.
- Yeah, and you won't be at full strength.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.975
No witchcraft.

04:01.108 --> 04:05.113
Look, I need the cure for my brother
from the book...

04:05.278 --> 04:08.384
...and if you are stalling...
- Why on Earth would I stall?

04:08.548 --> 04:11.085
I want the Mark off your brother
for my own protection.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.094
Out of these chains, out of this pit...

04:13.253 --> 04:15.790
...you to hold up your end
of the deal and kill Crowley.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.902
You remember the deal,
do you not, Samuel?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.298
Believe me, I have no
issue killing Crowley.

04:24.264 --> 04:29.942
The problem is, the language Nadya used
in the Codex is damn near indecipherable.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.448
She was a gifted witch, but a selfish pig.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.578
Once she cracked a code,
she then coded its secrets for herself.

04:38.311 --> 04:44.091
So now we need to break a code
to break a code?

04:44.251 --> 04:45.958
Quick, aren't you?

04:46.319 --> 04:49.664
Listen, Dean gets worse every day.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.598
Get this done.

04:55.095 --> 04:58.440
You won't forget
the grocery shopping, will you?

05:01.535 --> 05:02.605
No.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.684
Astounding.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.048
Astounding and disappointing.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.652
There was a time, Eldon,
when I would call you our most promising.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.817
You ask your brothers and your cousins.

05:16.983 --> 05:21.022
But clearly you have been spoiled and
overindulged and the result is arrogance.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.826
The utter lack of judgment.

05:23.290 --> 05:28.364
You thought you'd take time for a little quickie
with that girl before you harvested her?

05:28.528 --> 05:31.975
- Sir...
- And you were discovered by a witness.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.169
We don't have witnesses.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.806
And left a body behind.

05:38.471 --> 05:41.816
And we certainly don't
leave behind bodies when we harvest.

05:41.975 --> 05:47.687
The whole key to our success
all these centuries is secrecy.

05:47.848 --> 05:52.160
Daddy, I've never done anything
like this before.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.697
I haven't been myself...

05:54.855 --> 05:57.836
...ever since Jacob died.
- Oh, no.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.164
No, no, no.

06:01.661 --> 06:05.074
Don't you dare cheapen
the memory of your brother...

06:05.232 --> 06:08.213
...by using him as an excuse
for your foolishness.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.182
I'm filled with regret, sir.

06:11.671 --> 06:13.708
I doubt that.

06:13.874 --> 06:18.516
But you will be, if you are cast down
to the lower echelons of this family...

06:18.678 --> 06:22.091
...where you will exchange
your title of son and heir...

06:22.249 --> 06:23.421
...for lab rat.

06:24.684 --> 06:28.063
I made this single mistake.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.723
Discipline.

06:30.257 --> 06:35.206
It is all that holds our life together.
If it unravels, we are done.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.271
Here's how you'll redeem yourself.

06:40.433 --> 06:44.040
First, clean up your mess in Omaha.

06:44.204 --> 06:49.051
Next, you will track down
these Winchesters...

06:49.209 --> 06:51.416
...who murdered your brother Jacob...

06:51.578 --> 06:55.082
...and who may now have in their
possession the Book of the Damned.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.555
It will be done.

07:08.561 --> 07:11.098
Sir? Uncle Monroe?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.470
Yes, Eli?

07:12.666 --> 07:16.409
I was wondering if it was best...

07:16.569 --> 07:21.245
...to put such an important assignment
in Eldon's hands, since his...

07:22.175 --> 07:24.746
...judgment is so questionable.

07:25.412 --> 07:28.086
That's very bold of you,
Eli, considering your own issues.

07:28.481 --> 07:29.824
My issues, sir?

07:29.983 --> 07:34.625
The mysterious redheaded girl your cousin
Jacob was tracking when he died...

07:34.788 --> 07:36.790
...the one that stole the book.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.665
Was that task not passed on to you?

07:39.826 --> 07:42.830
- Have you located her?
- I'm trying, sir.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.109
There's still no trace of her.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.973
Well, if the Winchesters don't
have the book, she's got it.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.948
So if you're so worried
that your cousin will fail...

07:51.104 --> 07:54.210
...report in with Eldon
and back his effort.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.948
Now, get out.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.133
Wow.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.676
- Hey.
- You look like crap on toast.

08:21.868 --> 08:24.474
I just haven't really been sleeping well.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.047
- Is there a woman you haven't mentioned?
- A woman?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.916
I'm just saying, you weren't here
when I went to bed...

08:31.077 --> 08:34.320
...you've been running off on your own
a lot these past couple weeks.

08:34.881 --> 08:35.985
I do that.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.253
You actually don't.

08:39.385 --> 08:43.357
Dean, we don't always do the exact
same thing at the exact same time.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.197
Remember when you went off
and snuffed that vampire nest?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.862
- Have you been snuffing vamps' nests?
- No, I...

08:51.898 --> 08:54.003
What is that? What are you doing?

08:55.235 --> 08:58.045
So those goons that were after the book,
the Stynes?

08:58.204 --> 09:01.242
Well, the one that we killed
said that he had a big family.

09:01.408 --> 09:04.719
So if there's more out there,
we should get to know as much as we can.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.852
- And?
- Well, there's pretty much what we do know.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.550
Screwed with financial markets...

09:09.716 --> 09:13.061
...they helped Hitler get started,
God knows what else, probably disco.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.932
But you go back to the 1800s
and the trail goes dead.

09:16.089 --> 09:19.559
Nothing in the research or online.
Like the family just popped up one day.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.366
- Families don't usually do that.
- No, they do not.

09:22.529 --> 09:25.237
It hasn't been a total waste of time.
I caught us a case.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.776
There's a mention online
of a murder in Omaha.

09:27.934 --> 09:32.383
Victim's eyes were cut out, janitor runs in
just as the killer jumps out the window.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.583
- That's it?
- The window was on the third story.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.418
Look, man, I'm just trying
to stay busy here, okay?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.722
Unless you have bigger fish to fry.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.729
No, I'm sold. I'm in.

09:48.888 --> 09:51.767
All right, well, I'm gonna hit it.
You probably should too.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.337
We'll leave first thing in the a.m.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.086
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, it is you.

10:13.246 --> 10:17.251
Uh, in a beat-up, prehistoric subcompact.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.998
But why here?
I could have come to the Death Star.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.362
No, no, this is, uh...

10:24.858 --> 10:26.496
This is better, actually.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.469
We're not gonna be working
in the bunker, so...

10:29.996 --> 10:30.997
Uh-huh.

10:31.865 --> 10:35.312
What is this about again?
You were kind of vague.

10:37.370 --> 10:41.011
Dean is not getting any better.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.149
I feel like if we don't get the Mark
off his arm, it's gonna eat him up.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.482
I get it, but what are
we gonna do about it?

10:48.648 --> 10:53.996
I got ahold of a Codex which is a collection
of supernatural code-breaking tools...

10:54.154 --> 10:56.691
...and it should help crack
the Book of the Damned.

10:56.856 --> 11:00.827
That would be awesome if the book,
you know, actually existed.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.664
It does.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.809
L, um...

11:10.870 --> 11:13.874
I swapped it out right before
it looked like I burned it.

11:14.174 --> 11:18.884
Okay, well, Dean wanted it burned,
so is he pissed?

11:20.713 --> 11:22.693
Of course, he doesn't know.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.319
- Jeez, the two of you.
- Charlie, he's not himself.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.663
He's not, he would try and stop me.
He's given up.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.069
Look, I called in an expert
to use the Codex...

11:35.228 --> 11:38.539
...but it turns out it's
sort of encoded also...

11:38.698 --> 11:42.236
...so I thought you might help
move things along faster.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.040
Behind Dean's back?

11:44.204 --> 11:48.380
After Dean told us the stupid book
would kick our asses if we messed with it?

11:49.676 --> 11:52.384
Is there any part of
this that doesn't reek?

11:52.545 --> 11:56.584
Did I mention you'll be working with one
of the most dangerous witches in the world?

11:59.686 --> 12:00.721
I don't know, Sam.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.699
As far as I can tell,
this is our only shot at saving him.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.598
If we don't take it...

12:07.760 --> 12:09.535
...he's gone.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.048
I thought I was clear, Samuel.

12:25.211 --> 12:28.556
I requested more time, not an assistant.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.991
And I thought I was clear, Rowena.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.929
Charlie is not your assistant.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.794
You're hers.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.899
And you studied your craft where?

12:39.058 --> 12:41.163
Mostly a joint called Mas Java.

12:41.327 --> 12:44.137
- Excellent Wi-Fi.
- I have not heard of this institution...

12:44.297 --> 12:46.402
...and I know all the
centers of witchcraft.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.479
Makes sense, because I'm not a witch.
I'm a nerd.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.673
And I know all the
great centers of nerddom.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.615
Rowena, are you done marking your turf?

12:57.777 --> 13:00.758
Charlie has tech chops
that'll speed up cracking Nadya's Codex.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.917
You will spot the ancient
curses and spells...

13:04.517 --> 13:07.020
...and that'll put this
whole mess in context.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.197
Cass. Are you in on this too?

13:12.025 --> 13:15.268
Hell's bells, more distractions.

13:15.695 --> 13:18.767
What are you? Witch or nerd?

13:18.931 --> 13:21.537
- Angel.
- Beg pardon?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.874
Castiel has powers...

13:26.039 --> 13:29.282
...spiritual muscle,
that'll help safeguard the work.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.853
Safeguard it from what?

13:32.211 --> 13:34.122
You.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.886
I can't be here full-time to referee.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.859
- And I can?
- Yes, please.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.124
Please do this for me.

13:44.524 --> 13:48.904
What are the rules? If I'm gonna referee,
I should at least know them.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.565
Quite literal, aren't you?

13:51.731 --> 13:55.474
Does he know that the first rule is,
"Don't tell your brother what we're doing"?

13:56.369 --> 13:58.076
Dean doesn't know?

13:58.237 --> 14:01.514
- Sam, this never ends well.
- That's exactly what I said.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.711
Okay, everyone take a breath.

14:03.876 --> 14:07.380
Look, we're up against it, okay?
And we've all been up against it before...

14:07.547 --> 14:11.757
...and we know there are times
when every choice sucks. Now, us...

14:12.819 --> 14:15.857
...lying to Dean is the choice
that sucks the least.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.699
We have to make this work.

14:19.325 --> 14:20.929
Please.

14:24.263 --> 14:26.004
Okay, yeah.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.769
For Dean.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.172
Cass?

14:30.336 --> 14:33.215
Okay, for Dean.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.943
For Dean.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.419
I barely know the man.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.133
I hope this is important.

14:56.295 --> 14:57.603
I have a perfect game going.

14:58.464 --> 15:00.102
There's a problem, Majesty.

15:01.367 --> 15:04.712
Just for once, I wish you trolls
would bring me some good news.

15:04.871 --> 15:08.546
"Sire, Missouri has boils."
Something cheerful.

15:10.276 --> 15:12.813
- It's Your Majesty's mother.
- What about my mother?

15:15.782 --> 15:16.783
She's missing.

15:17.817 --> 15:18.887
What?

15:30.163 --> 15:32.575
You've heard of killing the messenger?

15:32.999 --> 15:35.980
Don't come back
without news of my mother.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.085
Shut up.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.759
Nice grouping.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.927
The police told me no one was allowed in.
That didn't mean the FBI, right?

15:57.089 --> 16:00.298
- The janitor came in right after the killing?
- He heard screaming.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.440
Maybe when her eyeballs
were scooped out?

16:02.595 --> 16:06.202
Janitor saw a man jump out the window
and run down the alley.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.034
Running.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.442
After, uh, falling three stories.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.106
That's what it looked like.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.047
- Security footage'?
- Yeah, sure.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.212
But just one of them caught any action.
Out in the alley.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.154
That's the guy who rented the office.

16:25.318 --> 16:29.698
- That's pretty slick for a three-story drop.
- Wait a second, can you, uh, play it again?

16:29.856 --> 16:31.062
Yeah.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.295
Keep going.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.066
Okay, freeze there.

16:37.563 --> 16:38.837
Zoom in.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.143
Same ink as the Stynes.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.981
- How long was he renting here?
- Just a month.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.180
But, uh, I only saw him a day or so.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.919
Some sort of clinical trial
using student volunteers.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.391
He didn't mention eyeballs.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.689
Hmm.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.264
I guess you're gonna ask
about that from now on, huh?

17:02.421 --> 17:03.559
Excuse me.

17:07.926 --> 17:12.672
Listen, you, uh, remember anything else,
give us a call.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.775
Telemarketer.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.440
You're quite the Chatty Patty.

17:45.431 --> 17:48.878
- What did you tell those two?
- Hardly anything. Nothing.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.311
I've got nothing to say.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.789
I believe you.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.269
- Damn it.
- That miraculous machine of yours...

18:23.436 --> 18:28.681
...hasn't solved everything by now?
Ahem. Overrated, I'd say.

18:29.508 --> 18:32.421
I'm using the computer to find
a pattern in the book's coding.

18:32.578 --> 18:36.754
Or any synchronicity with the symbols
in Nadya's Codex.

18:36.916 --> 18:40.830
I'm more old school.
I read the signs nature shows me.

18:40.987 --> 18:44.093
The forces that ruled before there was man.

18:44.256 --> 18:45.997
WOW, why didn't I think Of that?

18:46.158 --> 18:48.866
Okay, it sounds like blood sugar
is dipping in here.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.200
I got snacks.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.807
When I was human...

18:53.966 --> 18:56.845
...I grew very fond of these pork rinds.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.944
What do you know about the chick
who wrote the Book of the Damned?

19:02.441 --> 19:06.856
Agnes was a hermit nun
and as mad as a hatter.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.186
Made it her business to undo curses.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.830
Like the one that caused the Mark of Cain.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.455
As in any struggle between good and evil,
balance is required.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.463
To cure one curse,
Agnes had to know how to inflict another.

19:20.626 --> 19:25.234
They live side-by-side in the magic world.
One cannot be without the other.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.639
Sure, sure, like a binary system.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.206
So I gotta think like a hermit nun.

19:33.072 --> 19:36.519
- Did I mention they burned her alive?
- They?

19:36.676 --> 19:41.250
A cornucopia of curses and satanic visions did
not go unnoticed by the church hierarchy.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.587
These men would not abide a rogue nun.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.530
Poor Agnes. Ahead of her time.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.257
Much like you and I.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.565
Well.

20:03.402 --> 20:07.407
I actually don't see our similarities
all that much.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.382
Because you're young and good...

20:09.542 --> 20:11.613
...and I'm ancient and evil, is that it?

20:13.279 --> 20:14.349
What...?

20:14.714 --> 20:17.092
Let me tell you about you.

20:17.616 --> 20:20.597
A difficult and lonely childhood.

20:20.753 --> 20:24.030
Tragedy. Absent parents.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.794
Always outside the mainstream.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.697
Sexually progressive.

20:28.861 --> 20:32.274
Living in your own head
for solace and direction.

20:35.634 --> 20:38.706
Yeah, but still, we are pretty different.

20:38.871 --> 20:41.408
I read you the minute I saw you.

20:41.574 --> 20:47.923
And I'm sure you're learning that the line
between good and evil is quite flexible.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.152
But we part company
when it comes to blind devotion.

20:51.317 --> 20:54.230
Case in point, the Winchesters.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.399
You've made them the family
you don't have. Foolish.

20:59.992 --> 21:04.907
Sam and Dean are like my brothers.
I love them.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.739
I know.

21:07.666 --> 21:12.115
And that steadfast loyalty
will be your undoing, my girl.

21:18.511 --> 21:23.790
So why would the Stynes be actually
up to the eyeballs in murder?

21:23.949 --> 21:25.656
What's the connection?

21:25.818 --> 21:29.857
You take a few Stynes down, more pop up.
I mean, how many are there?

21:30.422 --> 21:34.837
All I can say is I'm glad we burned that book.
At least they can't get their mitts on that.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.142
Yeah. Um, what about you?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.504
How are you doing?

21:41.467 --> 21:43.811
- Oh, you mean the thing?
- Yeah.

21:44.470 --> 21:48.111
I don't know. Some dark thoughts,
creepy visions, violent urges.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.379
Same old, same old.

21:50.543 --> 21:53.456
I'm happy I've got a murder
to focus on, though.

22:22.708 --> 22:23.709
Cass?

22:24.877 --> 22:27.483
- Sam.
- No, it's Dean.

22:29.882 --> 22:35.355
- What's up?
- Nothing. I'm just staying in touch.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.228
Like I do.

22:38.858 --> 22:43.398
Something on your mind?
- No, this call is pointless.

22:45.397 --> 22:47.536
My ride's here.

22:54.573 --> 22:56.746
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:56.909 --> 23:00.254
The fridge is picked clean.
Your turn to fly, I buy.

23:00.412 --> 23:02.756
That's mine, right?

23:04.049 --> 23:07.758
Hey, uh, have you talked to Cass recently?

23:08.687 --> 23:12.191
No. Not for a while. Why?

23:12.758 --> 23:14.601
I was just wondering what he's up to.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.707
- He's got to be up to something, right?
- Yeah.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.776
Angel stuff or... I don't know.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.107
Yeah.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.078
All right. I vote for pizza.

23:31.710 --> 23:36.125
Yes. Yes, Rowena is a handful.

23:37.616 --> 23:40.392
Oh, mercy. Snakes in the bed.

23:40.552 --> 23:43.055
That would set my teeth on edge.

23:43.622 --> 23:48.230
If I owned a bed. Or slept. Ever.

23:48.394 --> 23:55.107
Look, I get it. She's unpleasant, she's
horrible, she has a messy workstation.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.474
What's the din?

23:58.170 --> 24:00.116
Must be something I don't know about her.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.685
Something I could hold over her
as a bargaining chip.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.487
A demon lover?

24:11.951 --> 24:14.955
You don't need to paint a picture.
Is there anything else?

24:18.123 --> 24:19.193
Really?

24:22.761 --> 24:23.796
Are you sure?

24:27.766 --> 24:29.643
I need a minion.

24:30.336 --> 24:33.215
We are scouring the planet, sire.
Around the clock.

24:33.372 --> 24:36.649
- We will not rest until your mother is found.
- I should say you won't.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.516
And I have another mission for you.

24:38.711 --> 24:41.851
- Yes, sir.
- Locate this person, immediately.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.459
I don't care what it takes.

24:43.615 --> 24:46.357
Fail on pain of infinite pain.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.125
On it, Your Majesty.

24:50.689 --> 24:51.861
You're still here.

24:56.295 --> 24:59.640
Surrounded by mediocrity.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.207
It's a wonder I stay so buoyant.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.909
All right, hold it right there.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.250
Hey, hold it.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.251
I said, hold it.

26:26.618 --> 26:27.790
I am doing my best...

26:27.953 --> 26:30.456
...but with her criticizing,
breathing down my neck...

26:30.622 --> 26:32.295
...trying to sign me up for team witch...

26:32.458 --> 26:36.133
...oh, oh, and moaning how the one
good year for music was 1723...

26:36.295 --> 26:39.833
...I am going crazy. I mean, she is evil.
- I know.

26:40.299 --> 26:43.109
She is a wicked witch, so by definition...

26:43.268 --> 26:45.976
No, no, no, I mean something bad
is gonna happen here.

26:47.473 --> 26:52.821
Castiel, man, just spring me for two
hours. One hour. Anyplace quiet.

26:52.978 --> 26:55.083
Dean is my buddy
and I cannot screw this up...

26:55.247 --> 26:59.252
...but my mind, it's a wad of gummy worms.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.529
Please.

27:04.990 --> 27:08.301
Here's how this works.
You're strong, I'll give you that.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.098
But you can bleed and hurt...

27:10.262 --> 27:12.333
...so I'll ask questions,
you give answers...

27:12.498 --> 27:14.341
...or it's gonna get crazy real quick.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.480
Well, I hope you got some time.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.315
I'm not the usual breed of cat.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.147
Neither are we.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.483
Did you kill that girl in Omaha?

27:27.679 --> 27:29.317
Yeah.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.457
So it's true.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.830
You have the Mark of Cain. My sympathies.

27:40.125 --> 27:44.631
That's why you wanted the book.
To remove it.

27:44.796 --> 27:47.868
We wanted the book because
that's where your power comes from.

27:49.034 --> 27:52.538
See, our family business
is putting guys like you out of business.

27:52.704 --> 27:53.739
Oh.

27:54.706 --> 27:55.878
That's impressive.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.720
Let me tell you about my family business.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.491
You're in way over your heads.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.927
The family is vast,
spread over the world...

28:08.720 --> 28:11.701
...and that power you mentioned
doesn't come from the book...

28:11.857 --> 28:15.498
...it comes from intelligence and will.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.572
The book facilitates.

28:18.730 --> 28:23.076
Stock market dive, recession, 9/11,
any of them ring a bell?

28:24.002 --> 28:26.744
Arab Spring? Didn't even break a sweat.

28:26.905 --> 28:29.078
Okay. Why?

28:30.576 --> 28:33.056
Well, you got to be in it to win it, boys.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.921
You see, chaos breeds fear,
fear breeds panic...

28:38.083 --> 28:39.585
...and panic breeds desperation.

28:39.751 --> 28:42.391
And there's always profit
to be made from desperation.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.431
You make a big enough mess,
it has to get cleaned up.

28:46.592 --> 28:49.232
We've been in the fix-it business
for a thousand years...

28:49.394 --> 28:51.601
...and business has never been better.

28:54.466 --> 28:57.936
Now, for the last 80 years
we haven't had the book.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.615
With the book, we're unstoppable.

29:08.947 --> 29:11.427
Cass, what's going on? Make it quick.

29:11.883 --> 29:14.955
The girl you killed, why take her eyes?

29:15.120 --> 29:19.933
That whole situation. Unfortunate.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.096
We normally never leave a body
when we harvest.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.470
When you what?

29:27.966 --> 29:29.809
It's a family specialty.

29:29.968 --> 29:33.780
Bioengineering. Surgical enhancement.

29:33.939 --> 29:37.079
And I'm not talking about nose jobs.

29:37.809 --> 29:41.154
See? Two hearts in here.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.623
A bunch of extra muscle,
especially in the legs.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.828
Every man in the family's
had a little something.

29:47.252 --> 29:50.165
Pretty much what you'd expect though,
given the family tree.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.969
- The Stynes?
- The real family tree.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.763
The name was altered out of necessity.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.636
You have chanced upon a lineage...

30:03.802 --> 30:07.773
...with a long and proud tradition.

30:08.940 --> 30:11.443
And some unwanted notoriety.

30:12.844 --> 30:15.450
One of Europe's oldest families.

30:15.947 --> 30:17.688
The House of...

30:19.117 --> 30:20.994
...Frankenstein.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.190
- Let me focus.
- Biggest witches of history...

30:23.355 --> 30:26.859
...have sought my counsel and yet
you spurned me when I offered myself.

30:27.059 --> 30:30.871
I don't think I'm making myself clear.
I've got a situation here.

30:31.029 --> 30:34.909
There's no way Charlie can go off by herself.
Dangerous people are looking for her.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.014
- Fine, I'll go with her.
- You can't leave Rowena alone either.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.517
Nothing is getting done.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.675
Then separate them.
Do the best you can.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.551
The Frankensteins aren't real.
They're made-up.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.522
Of course.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.823
And we never had a family acquaintance
named Mary Shelley...

30:53.985 --> 30:56.363
...who spent a few nights
in Castle Frankenstein...

30:56.521 --> 30:59.058
...and stumbled upon our secrets...

30:59.224 --> 31:01.830
...and forced us to change our name
and go underground.

31:01.993 --> 31:03.734
So why didn't Shelley go public?

31:04.329 --> 31:07.867
She wrote a book.
It doesn't get more public than that.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.068
Hmm.

31:09.901 --> 31:13.849
But no one believed it to be true,
just like no one's gonna believe you.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.349
Well, as long as
my brother and me believe...

31:19.745 --> 31:21.088
...that's enough.

31:21.246 --> 31:23.089
Yeah, well...

31:23.915 --> 31:27.260
...as mighty as I'm sure
your little family is...

31:27.419 --> 31:29.922
...mine is a juggernaut.

31:31.256 --> 31:34.066
We're not ordinary men, we're Spartans.

31:38.930 --> 31:40.773
But you aren't immortal.

31:40.932 --> 31:43.936
What we are is expendable.

31:44.436 --> 31:48.077
I go down, there's an army
of replacements behind me.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.049
And where does this army call home? Hmm?

31:50.208 --> 31:52.119
Who's the Big Daddy Frankenstein?

31:52.277 --> 31:56.225
Were you here when I mentioned
that we're underground?

31:56.381 --> 32:01.262
- There are secrets.
- Well, I'm swell at uncovering secrets.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.429
You give me the book...

32:06.591 --> 32:10.471
...and it's conceivable
that we could have a conversation.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.470
The book?

32:15.167 --> 32:17.272
Dude, we don't have the book.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.313
The book was burned.

32:20.906 --> 32:23.819
The book is protected by a spell.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.585
It's eternal.

32:27.245 --> 32:29.486
It cannot be destroyed.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.159
Look, Cass, I've got to get back.

32:36.321 --> 32:39.495
Handle this. I'll be
there as soon as I can.

32:42.194 --> 32:45.641
- What are you doing?
- Uh, something came up.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.834
- What?
- It's handled.

32:47.999 --> 32:50.138
What's going on? Get any more out of him?

32:50.302 --> 32:52.839
Yeah, an earful. Truly.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.777
Let me ask you something.

33:14.025 --> 33:16.471
Oh, my God, he ripped it off.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.706
Alone time? Why does she need alone time?

33:27.305 --> 33:30.047
A bit of a prima donna, if you ask me.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.190
The girl is simply out of her league.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.564
Without me, the work grinds to a halt.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.831
Rowena, she needs quiet.

33:50.996 --> 33:55.035
She's under pressure and it doesn't help
she feels like shes betraying her friend.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.510
Oh, betrayal. Pfft.

33:57.669 --> 33:58.739
She'll get over it.

33:58.904 --> 34:02.249
Once she has children of her own,
she'll know all about betrayal.

34:03.408 --> 34:04.512
You have a child?

34:05.410 --> 34:07.219
Do I have a child?

34:07.379 --> 34:11.259
The King of Hell, that's all. The king.

34:12.417 --> 34:14.897
Crowley is your son'?

34:16.420 --> 34:18.697
Well, that explains a lot.

34:20.257 --> 34:21.931
I'm sure that was quite a challenge.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.408
Well, back to it, eh?
We're wasting time in here.

34:31.937 --> 34:33.712
I'm gonna see how she's doing.

34:50.621 --> 34:51.760
Charlie?

35:11.142 --> 35:12.450
I know where she is.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.319
Now, I can take care of it for you
if you want.

35:17.782 --> 35:22.788
- It would be my pleasure.
- No, I need to handle this.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.163
- Give me the location.
- You got a pencil?

35:27.492 --> 35:30.996
- Just spill.
- A dump called the Blackbird Motel.

35:31.162 --> 35:36.009
Registered under the name Carrie Asimov.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.682
Hey, any sign of him?

35:42.307 --> 35:44.947
A lot of signs, just no him.

35:45.110 --> 35:49.820
I followed the blood trail, which, by the way,
was like the Mississippi, until it ran dry.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.120
Meaning what, he bled out?

35:52.651 --> 35:54.824
Meaning that the trail stopped.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.023
Vanished. Nada.

35:57.389 --> 36:01.701
He sure must've thought he was gonna
win that one because, phew, was he gabby.

36:02.494 --> 36:06.704
I've been going through everything on the
Frankensteins and it's just like Eldon said.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.038
I mean, a thousand years of nasty.

36:09.200 --> 36:12.374
They made a ton mopping up
the Black Plague...

36:12.537 --> 36:15.541
...they started the Hundred Years War.

36:17.709 --> 36:21.714
You know, I thought,
"Man, there's a lot of them Stynes."

36:21.913 --> 36:25.190
You know, it's like alpha male central.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.830
And then I thought, and this is key...

36:28.319 --> 36:31.732
...I thought, "This is bad,
but it would really blow...

36:31.890 --> 36:33.369
...if these guys had the book."

36:34.392 --> 36:36.702
At least they don't have the damn book.

36:37.228 --> 36:39.230
Yeah. Yeah.

36:41.232 --> 36:43.712
At least the damn book burned.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.404
Right, Sam?

36:47.072 --> 36:49.848
But then Eldon Frankenstein,
he hits me with this fun fact.

36:50.008 --> 36:53.751
He says that the book can't be destroyed.

36:56.414 --> 37:00.863
He says that it can't be sliced, diced,
shredded, burned, drowned...

37:01.019 --> 37:04.592
...cannot be destroyed. Isn't that crazy?

37:05.857 --> 37:07.393
Because...

37:08.693 --> 37:11.105
...I know I saw something burn.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.543
Sam, you answer that, so help me.

37:25.276 --> 37:28.450
- Hey.
- Sam, she's gone.

37:28.613 --> 37:30.615
- Who's gone?
- I've looked everywhere.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.284
Charlie is gone.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.646
Ezekiel. Seven letters.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.305
Seven represents The Seeker.

38:04.315 --> 38:06.022
Okay.

38:16.594 --> 38:17.766
Okay.

38:19.597 --> 38:22.009
Saints represent groups of letters...

38:22.167 --> 38:24.773
...that represent numbers...

38:25.503 --> 38:29.178
...that stand for concepts
represented by...

38:34.045 --> 38:35.115
Oh, wow.

38:36.281 --> 38:37.316
I might be a genius.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.525
I know you're in here, Ms. Asimov.

38:41.686 --> 38:44.360
You have it. I want it.

38:59.704 --> 39:02.981
I don't freaking believe it.
You got Charlie involved with this again?

39:03.141 --> 39:04.484
And now she's missing?

39:10.315 --> 39:11.555
Charlie, where are you?

39:11.716 --> 39:16.665
Um, a motel. The Blackbird.
Sam, someone is here.

39:18.389 --> 39:19.891
They think I have the book.

39:20.058 --> 39:24.063
- If you have the book, give it to them.
- Charlie has the damn Book of the Damned?

39:24.229 --> 39:27.073
No, I don't have it. I
just... I have my notes.

39:27.232 --> 39:30.736
Then give them your notes, Charlie.
Give them the code, whatever they want.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.246
Charlie, I don't know
what is going on, but listen.

39:33.404 --> 39:35.907
Give whoever that is whatever
they want, understand?

39:45.583 --> 39:46.891
Charlie?

39:47.685 --> 39:48.891
I can't do that, Dean.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.787
So you had the book the whole time.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.623
Dude, you lied right to my face.

40:20.785 --> 40:23.288
It was our only chance to get you free,
I grabbed it.

40:23.454 --> 40:26.765
- I made it clear how I felt. You consider that?
- Dean, listen...

40:26.925 --> 40:29.132
And then you pulled Cass into it.
And Charlie.

40:29.294 --> 40:31.467
Charlie loves you, Dean.

40:31.629 --> 40:33.575
We all love you.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.616
You're gonna give me what's mine.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.986
Mine and my family's.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.162
Oh, God.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.869
Charlie?
