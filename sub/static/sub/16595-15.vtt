No games, no tricks,
no nothing.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.929
Consider this
your graduation.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.698
What's all this for?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.467
Well, I thought
- you guys would celebrate

17:49.502 --> 17:50.568
by making
a nice bundt cake.

17:53.272 --> 17:54.405
Okay, I get it.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.773
By having us do
something that we love,

17:55.808 --> 17:57.308
it'll put our relationship
back together.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.309
That's crazy.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.677
Mr. B. would never do that.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.514
That's<i> exactly</i>
what I'm doing.

18:05.284 --> 18:08.085
Plus,
and most importantly,

18:08.120 --> 18:10.121
I like bundt cakes.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.455
You know what?

18:11.490 --> 18:12.756
It's not gonna work,
because those days are over.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.125
No, they're not.
- Those days are just beginning.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.226
You're brothers now.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.927
You're kind of
stuck with each other.

18:16.962 --> 18:19.297
My brothers
glued me to a dog once.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.000
I feel bad for that dog.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.404
You have terrible brothers.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.140
It's not your fault.

18:29.175 --> 18:30.841
But this family's different.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.176
We fight each other,

18:32.211 --> 18:33.778
but ultimately,
we fight<i> for</i> each other.

18:35.714 --> 18:36.747
If there's one thing
to learn from me,

18:36.782 --> 18:38.449
it's at least that.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.020
I do like
the new bundt pan.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.789
Well, if you do decide
to bake the bundt cake,

18:45.824 --> 18:48.692
coat the inside of the pan
with clarified butter.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.528
You'll be thanking me
at clean-up time.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.298
I'm sorry, Kyle.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.499
I am not gonna let him

18:55.534 --> 18:57.101
manipulate me
- into making up with you.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.003
Yeah. Me, either.

18:59.038 --> 19:00.938
Although, it...

19:00.973 --> 19:02.206
it would be nice
- to finally have a brother

19:02.241 --> 19:03.374
I could count on.

19:06.011 --> 19:07.078
Yeah.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.914
Damn it!

19:11.850 --> 19:13.818
How does he always do this?

19:15.221 --> 19:17.722
So, does this mean
we're gonna bake?

19:18.424 --> 19:19.490
Absolutely.
- All right!

19:22.061 --> 19:23.494
Hey.

19:23.529 --> 19:24.995
So, uh -- so, how'd it go?

19:25.030 --> 19:27.298
Well, you know how things
work around here --

19:27.333 --> 19:29.500
things break, I fix 'em.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.702
You know the bathroom door
still doesn't shut?

19:31.737 --> 19:33.771
I know. I'll call Kris.
She'll take care of it.

19:41.447 --> 19:44.882
Hey, Jimmy. It's me.

19:44.917 --> 19:45.983
I was --

19:46.018 --> 19:47.851
No. Dad's not dead.
He's all right.

19:47.886 --> 19:50.154
Just wanted
to talk to my kid brother.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.822
Yeah. That's it.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.058
So, big question --

19:54.093 --> 19:55.693
Are you still a dumbass?

20:03.269 --> 20:04.401
Hey.
- Hey.

20:04.436 --> 20:05.703
Want a piece
of bundt cake?

20:05.738 --> 20:07.205
Bundt yeah.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.742
So, uh, Evie,

20:11.777 --> 20:13.877
a little birdie told me
you're looking for love advice.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.880
Oh, damn it.
- I knew the cake was a trap.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.616
All right,
you got six bites.

20:18.651 --> 20:19.950
All right.

20:19.985 --> 20:22.119
When I was in college,

20:22.154 --> 20:25.522
I met a handsome guy
who wrote me love poems,

20:25.557 --> 20:27.391
brought me wildflowers,

20:27.426 --> 20:29.126
and he didn't say
"I love you."

20:29.161 --> 20:31.295
He wrote it with rocks.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.932
You know, because -- because I love rocks.
- Mm.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.634
That doesn't sound like Dad.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.901
It wasn't.

20:37.936 --> 20:39.436
That was Jeff.

20:39.471 --> 20:40.971
He tried too hard.

20:41.006 --> 20:43.274
But he had a friend

20:43.309 --> 20:46.110
who was a ruggedly-handsome guy,
outdoorsy type,

20:46.145 --> 20:47.578
who was really
into politics.

20:47.613 --> 20:48.712
Dad?

20:48.747 --> 20:50.047
No.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.415
Craig.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.417
He's in jail now, so...

20:55.521 --> 20:59.590
But<i> he</i> knew
a crazy Michigan fan

20:59.625 --> 21:01.659
who came
to an Ohio State game,

21:01.694 --> 21:03.460
and he was the letter "G"

21:03.495 --> 21:06.130
in the lineup of
shirtless, drunk guys.

21:06.165 --> 21:10.601
And<i> that</i> was your father.

21:12.304 --> 21:15.272
I'm not really getting
the advice here, Mom.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.541
Yeah, I thought
- it would come to me, but...

21:18.477 --> 21:19.610
Oh, hey, you know what?

21:19.645 --> 21:20.911
I had 20 bucks on my desk.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.013
Have you seen it?
