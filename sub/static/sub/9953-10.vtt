00:01.376 --> 00:02.502
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.669 --> 00:04.785
The Hunter.
It's a meteor storm.

00:05.005 --> 00:08.418
It comes every 27 years,
and when it does, I disappear.

00:08.592 --> 00:11.675
- No.
- Nathan, it's coming in 46 days.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.472
Colorado Kid
was in that room with Lucy.

00:14.598 --> 00:19.137
I heard his first name. | matched it
with a facial composite, and I got this.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.426
- James Cogan.

00:20.604 --> 00:23.016
- I can protect your baby.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.308
- James Cogan is...

00:25.192 --> 00:26.557
He's my son?

00:26.693 --> 00:28.809
It's the bolt-gun killer.
- What about him?

00:28.987 --> 00:31.603
- What if he's not using body parts
for trophies?

00:31.782 --> 00:33.147
What if he's building a woman?

00:33.325 --> 00:37.238
- My people help the Troubled,
and we do it any way we can.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.660
- You vouch for me?
- Yeah.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.154
- Introduce me to the others.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.957
- It's a nice one too.
Modified it myself.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.246
- You're the bolt-gun killer.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.836
Where's Tommy?
(grunts)

00:49.007 --> 00:50.122
- Tell me where the barn is.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.592
- He went that way.
(gunfire)

00:56.223 --> 00:57.633
- We finally find him,
and we're left

00:57.766 --> 00:59.677
with more questions
than when we started.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.516
- Why was he taking parts
from women?

01:01.687 --> 01:04.099
- How did he even know
about the Colorado Kid?

01:04.231 --> 01:06.187
Who was he?
- We'll figure it out.

01:07.442 --> 01:08.693
- Is everything okay?

01:08.860 --> 01:09.815
(scoffs)

01:09.987 --> 01:12.694
- Everything is just
how it's supposed to be.

01:19.371 --> 01:22.534
- Mr. Bryer was out picking mushrooms
and found it.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.622
Looks like an animal
just dug it up.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.593
(gaSDS)

01:35.012 --> 01:38.220
- This body's burned,
just like Roslyn Toomey.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.179
- Another one of Tommy's victims?

01:40.350 --> 01:42.511
- We'll know for sure
once I X—ray the skull,

01:42.644 --> 01:44.475
see if there's a bolt-gun hole in it.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.470
- How quickly can you get me forensics?

01:46.607 --> 01:49.349
I need to know who this body is,
and how long it's been in that grave.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.187
- What's the hurry?
Tommy's dead.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.065
- Did somebody find the body?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.317
- No.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.074
I can get preliminary lab work for you
in a couple of hours.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.529
- Good.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.278
- Hey.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.744
Hey.

02:08.587 --> 02:10.293
You okay?
- Yeah.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.589
It's just... what if Tommy
made it off that boat?

02:14.718 --> 02:17.926
- You think he did this in the past week?
- I don't know.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.766
Grady was working with the Guard,

02:21.933 --> 02:24.140
he shot that woman
at the ATM with a bolt gun,

02:24.269 --> 02:25.725
Tommy was working with Grady.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.932
- Grady ended up dead and burnt too.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.975
Jordan says he was set up.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.357
She doesn't think Tommy
had anything to do with the Guard.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.566
- Do you believe her?

02:33.695 --> 02:36.107
- Yeah.
And it checks out.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.148
But the Guard knows a lot.
I'm getting close.

02:39.284 --> 02:42.071
- 27 years ago,
I wrote myself a note.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.785
Said I had to find my son.

02:43.955 --> 02:47.948
Now, | just gotta figure out
why Tommy was looking for him too.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.337
(tires screeching)
- Gotta get away. Gotta get away!

03:02.516 --> 03:04.552
(grunts)

03:05.560 --> 03:06.970
Gotta get away!

03:19.866 --> 03:21.731
(radio): A passing motorist reported men

03:21.868 --> 03:23.404
chasing each other into the woods

03:23.537 --> 03:25.778
after the van flew off the road.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.000
- We found the girl
crying in the van.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.085
Says her name
is Ginger Danvers.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.000
That's about all I could get out of her.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.464
- Okay.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.792
Ginger?

03:41.012 --> 03:42.263
It's okay.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.802
Listen, I'm here to help.
Can you tell me what happened?

03:46.977 --> 03:48.433
- Where's my daddy?

03:48.562 --> 03:49.517
Why'd he leave?

03:49.646 --> 03:51.261
- We're gonna find your father.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.434
Officer Colin,
he's gonna take you back

03:53.567 --> 03:55.933
to the station, okay?
Just for a little bit.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.936
- Come with me, sweetheart.
We'll find your father.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.988
- Something isn't right about this.

04:02.117 --> 04:05.575
- The Guard uses a Looking Glass Florists van
as a transport vehicle.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.535
Brings Troubled people to Haven.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.830
Told ya I've been digging.

04:11.001 --> 04:14.789
- Okay, so let's say the driver
was with the Guard.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.037
That would make the passenger the father.

04:17.215 --> 04:19.422
If his Trouble started in the van,
then that would explain

04:19.593 --> 04:22.676
why the driver was so scared
that he fled the vehicle.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.590
- So now this guy's loose.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.339
- With a Trouble so bad
that he abandoned his own daughter.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.225
(theme music)

05:05.806 --> 05:11.096
- So... why were you and your daddy
coming to Haven?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.233
You're from Atlanta, right?

05:22.489 --> 05:24.525
Do you like the Braves?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.862
I never said I was a child psychiatrist.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.781
- Hey.
Wanna get some lunch?

05:34.584 --> 05:36.085
- Busy, actually.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.369
- Oh, I see.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.292
What'd they get you for, kid?
Grand theft tricycle?

05:49.266 --> 05:50.847
No.

05:50.976 --> 05:54.059
That... that can't be right.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.270
You seem like a girl
who rides a two-wheeler.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.890
I'm telling ya,
you got the wrong kid, coppers.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.436
- Ginger didn't do anything wrong.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.276
We just wanna ask her
a couple questions.

06:03.405 --> 06:06.613
- Yeah, that's what
they always tell me too,

06:06.741 --> 06:11.110
but what I wanna know
is where are my client's crayons?

06:11.288 --> 06:13.745
Where are my client's video games?

06:13.874 --> 06:16.991
Where is my client's call
with Justin Bieber?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.244
You got rights, kid.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.294
- I do?
- Yeah.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.464
You know what I do
when they try to make me talk?

06:30.056 --> 06:32.593
I imagine them in their undenNear.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.841
(snickers)

06:34.519 --> 06:35.474
- Okay.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.478
- Excuse me, Audrey.
Got some results for you on that body.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.434
- If you want me to do
that psych profile

06:40.609 --> 06:43.817
on Tommy Bowen,
I need to hear this, so...

06:43.945 --> 06:46.482
- Ginger, I'm gonna have you
stay with Duke for a minute,

06:46.656 --> 06:49.523
all right? He's really funny.
You two have the same sense of humour.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.945
You'll have a lot of fun.
You're a lot of fun.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.950
- You are pretty funny.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.792
- Yes.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.503
I am funny.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.796
- You look like a pirate.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.209
- Do you know
what my favourite vegetable is?

07:09.346 --> 07:11.587
- Arrrr-tichokes.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.213
- You knew that one?
- Mm-hmm.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.011
- Okay.
I got another one for you.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.640
(sighs)

07:27.113 --> 07:30.731
(sighs)
- I love that I can do this with you.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.241
- I wish I wasn't here on business.

07:34.037 --> 07:38.906
- So are you working under this badge,
or that one?

07:39.084 --> 07:41.917
- There was an incident
with one of your transport vans.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.919
Looks like the Guard
was transporting a Troubled guy

07:45.048 --> 07:47.130
named Morton Danvers
out of Atlanta.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.045
He did something.
Made your driver flee.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.588
Then he took off.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.009
As far as we can tell,
he's dangerous.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.302
- I'm not in the loop on this one.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.391
- He left his daughter behind.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.727
- His daughter?

08:02.190 --> 08:03.475
- A nine-year-old.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.357
She's, uh, missing her dad,
and she's scared.

08:09.531 --> 08:13.319
- Let me make some calls,
see what I can find out.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.029
- Thanks.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.492
Hey, uh, did you find anything new

08:19.624 --> 08:22.491
from the Guard
about Audrey going away?

08:24.170 --> 08:26.206
- Just that she does.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.375
Sorry.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.607
Sorry, Lance.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.894
- This is supposed to be a safe house,

08:51.031 --> 08:53.192
and you're mooning
over your police chief boyfriend?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.108
- You think I'm enjoying this?
ljust lied to him.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.402
- People are pissed
you've been talking to that guy.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.617
- People have bigger things
to be pissed about.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.497
- Prelim lab results on our body.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.084
It's a bolt-gun wound, all right.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.548
The body's been buried
about five to eight weeks.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.256
- Okay.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.628
Good.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.427
- There's more.
The man's teeth were intact.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.595
We got a dental match in no time.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.593
- Wait, how... how so fast?

09:23.730 --> 09:24.685
- 'Cause he worked here.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.188
Matched the records we received
when we hired him.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.816
That burned body
is detective Thomas Bowen.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.228
- Tommy was here a week ago.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.821
That's impossible.
- Are you from Haven?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.284
- Have you done DNA?
- The DNA will confirm it,

09:39.454 --> 09:41.740
but the teeth don't lie.
- Wait, we were working with...

09:41.873 --> 09:43.989
- Somebody. But whoever it was,

09:44.125 --> 09:47.208
it wasn't Detective Thomas Bowen
from Boston,

09:47.337 --> 09:50.295
'cause for the last two months,
he's been worm food.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.970
- So you really live on a boat?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.301
- Not a boat.
A ship.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.769
- All by yourself?
Why don't you have a wife and kids?

10:05.939 --> 10:09.272
- Uh, no Mrs. Pirate for me.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.356
I do have a little girl, though.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.944
But she lives someplace else.

10:15.073 --> 10:18.531
| just don't think l was meant
to have a family, you know?

10:19.244 --> 10:21.075
- Me too.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.736
- Really?

10:24.207 --> 10:26.493
- I'm hungry.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.491
Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.038
But, uh...

10:30.797 --> 10:32.833
I think Audrey wants us to stay here.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.747
- Come on,
let's go get some ice cream.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.715
- Get some ice cream?

10:37.220 --> 10:40.053
I do have a soft spot for ice cream.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.340
And we're pirates.
I mean, we're outlaws, right?

10:43.518 --> 10:44.678
- Yeah.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.145
- Okay, why not?
- Yes. Okay.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.810
Come on.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.064
- What's this? What...

10:58.741 --> 11:01.153
The young lady asked
for a double scoop of Rocky Road.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.942
- That is a double scoop
of Rocky Road.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.361
- No, okay?

11:04.497 --> 11:06.954
This is... is a scoop-and-a-half
at best, okay?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.698
And what is this?

11:08.835 --> 11:11.668
Is this... is this peach frogurt mixed in
with her ice cream?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.203
- What are you, like, the fun uncle?

11:13.381 --> 11:15.918
- She asked for a double scoop
of Rocky Road ice cream, okay?

11:16.050 --> 11:18.541
This... is exactly the type
of behaviour

11:18.720 --> 11:21.427
why people like she and I
do not trust the man.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.304
- Yeah, well, she is gone.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.798
- She...

11:29.439 --> 11:33.182
Ginger?
- I saw her talking to her dad.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.309
- Her dad?
- That was her dad, right?

11:35.486 --> 11:36.737
That's why I thought you
were the fun uncle?

11:36.863 --> 11:39.070
(phone dialing)
- Ginger!

11:39.240 --> 11:40.741
Ginger!

11:44.078 --> 11:45.693
(Audrey): You took her out of the station?

11:45.872 --> 11:48.614
- She said she was hungry.
- There's food in the kitchen.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.247
- You mean the coffee and Slim Jims?

11:51.336 --> 11:55.705
The kid said she wanted some ice cream.
I thought she should have some ice cream.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.006
Maybe it was her father who took her.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.758
- Her father, whose Trouble
is scary enough

12:00.929 --> 12:03.545
to make a member of the Guard
jump out of a moving vehicle.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.137
- If they're on foot,
they couldn't have gotten far.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.507
Let's just split up.
- I'll go this way.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.475
- Keep your cellphone on.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.019
I never should've left her with Duke.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.854
- Hey, you got a lot on your mind.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.645
- Nathan, that burned body
that we found this morning?

12:16.778 --> 12:20.987
Turns out that it was
the real Detective Tommy Bowen.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.492
- What?
- He was killed and buried five weeks ago,

12:23.660 --> 12:25.525
when the first Tommy Bowen
came to town.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.448
- So who were we working with
this whole time?

12:27.622 --> 12:29.988
- Some Troubled person
impersonating Tommy

12:30.124 --> 12:32.115
and killing people with a bolt gun

12:32.252 --> 12:33.833
who was also looking for my son.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.452
- I got this.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.749
You go find whoever--
- We will.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.874
I can't just abandon one child for another.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.427
We've gotta help this little girl.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.261
That's what we're here to do, right?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.051
- Right.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.071
- Let me go!

13:02.407 --> 13:03.442
I hate you, mister!

13:03.574 --> 13:05.235
You're bad!
I hate your guts!

13:07.161 --> 13:08.116
- What...

13:08.288 --> 13:09.277
- I hate my guts...

13:09.455 --> 13:12.447
- What are you doing?
Stop her!

13:14.002 --> 13:16.664
- No.
I hate my guts!

13:16.838 --> 13:18.794
- Lance, no! No!

13:36.524 --> 13:37.934
- Ginger was here.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.857
But what happened?

13:40.028 --> 13:41.393
- This guy's with the Guard.

13:41.571 --> 13:45.155
Maybe he tried to stop her father,
and the father stabbed him.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.574
- Look at the angle of that knife.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.201
Look at how he's holding it.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.032
It doesn't look like he was pulling it out,
it looks like he was pushing it in.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.959
- A member of the Guard
flees his own vehicle,

13:59.088 --> 14:01.795
and now, a guy stabs himself.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.963
What if the Trouble is, like,
some kind of hypnosis?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.302
- What if it isn't the dad?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.714
- What do you mean?
- The dad was in the van.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.599
Maybe the dad was here at the stabbing,
but you know where the dad wasn't?

14:13.770 --> 14:16.432
In the police station
when Duke agreed to babysit Ginger,

14:16.564 --> 14:19.556
and he took her out for ice cream
because she wanted him to.

14:19.734 --> 14:20.849
- What are you saying?

14:21.027 --> 14:23.234
- Does that sound like something
that Duke would normally do?

14:23.404 --> 14:25.816
- You think it's Ginger?
- Yeah.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.445
And now Duke is out there
looking for her.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.827
(line trills)

14:32.955 --> 14:34.411
Duke.
- Hey, Audrey.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.041
- Hey, have you found her?

14:37.126 --> 14:39.287
- Don't tell her anything.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.747
- Um...

14:40.922 --> 14:43.129
- Duke, are you okay?
Where are you?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.086
- Let's just go play.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.963
- I can't tell you anything.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.304
- Duke, listen to me.
Ginger is the Troubled one, all right?

14:51.474 --> 14:54.011
She’s dangerous.
She can control your mind.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.301
- Yeah. You know,
I gotta go somewhere

14:56.437 --> 14:58.769
and play now, so bye.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.182
- Come on.
Let's go.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.897
I'll show you a good game.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.905
- Avast, ya landlubber.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.536
Ya stole me eye patch.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.950
- Take it back!
Take it back!

15:17.125 --> 15:18.331
- Aye, ya heard the young lady.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.163
I'll be taking me garments back
if you don't mind.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.620
(grunts)
Ha!

15:26.259 --> 15:28.341
Arrr!
(grunting)

15:32.056 --> 15:33.967
Ha!
And you can say hello

15:34.100 --> 15:36.136
to Davey Jones,
ya lilly-livered cur!

15:36.269 --> 15:37.930
(grunting)

15:39.313 --> 15:41.895
Ha-ha!
(grunting)

15:44.110 --> 15:46.317
(glass shatters)
(groans)

15:46.446 --> 15:48.437
(grunting)

15:51.617 --> 15:53.323
Ha-ha!

15:54.954 --> 15:56.034
Never fear, me lady!

15:56.205 --> 15:58.287
I'll save ya from these scurvy dogs.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.619
- More enemy pirates, Duke!
They're coming!

16:00.793 --> 16:01.828
- Ya stay belowdecks.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.790
l'll ward off these invaders
from the bridge!

16:04.922 --> 16:07.129
(grunts)
- You need to go higher!

16:07.258 --> 16:08.839
(grunting)
Be brave, Duke!

16:09.010 --> 16:10.625
You've got to save me!
They're attacking!

16:10.761 --> 16:12.501
(grunting)

16:20.438 --> 16:21.473
- Ha!

16:22.815 --> 16:24.055
(Audrey): Duke's car is here.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.732
- They're here!
- Ah?

16:26.861 --> 16:27.976
- Don't let them hurt me!

16:28.154 --> 16:29.644
- I'll make 'em taste me sword.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.816
Scallywags!
- Duke!

16:31.866 --> 16:33.322
(gaSDS)

16:36.162 --> 16:37.868
(crash)

16:37.997 --> 16:39.578
I'll take care of her.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.165
- Let me go!
- Ginger, stop.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.080
You're hurting people.
You've hurt Duke.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.790
- I didn't do anything!
We were just playing!

16:46.964 --> 16:48.500
Duke's fine!
You're fine, Duke!

16:48.674 --> 16:50.881
(Duke): Yeah.
(Nathan): Whoa. Hey.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.592
- I'm fine.
(sighs)

16:54.347 --> 16:56.679
I'm totally...
(groans)

16:56.807 --> 16:58.843
(Nathan): Whoa! Hey!

17:06.150 --> 17:09.187
- In the van, Ginger,
what did you say to your dad?

17:10.238 --> 17:11.944
- My dad kept bothering me...

17:13.741 --> 17:16.027
saying how much
I would love it here in Haven.

17:17.787 --> 17:21.621
I told him to leave me alone and get away.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.536
- And he did.
He left you alone.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.662
People do what you say now, Ginger.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.288
You're special.

17:30.466 --> 17:34.050
- You don't.
- Well, I'm... l'm special too.

17:35.721 --> 17:39.589
Do you know why your dad
was bringing you here to Haven?

17:39.767 --> 17:41.428
- He said it would be good for me.

17:42.645 --> 17:46.183
I think it was because
he wanted to get rid of me.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.432
- And what about your mom?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.901
- My mom, uh, died,

17:52.029 --> 17:54.441
and when she did,

17:54.574 --> 17:57.486
my dad started treating me differently.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.869
He, uh... he doesn't
like me anymore.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.200
- I bet he loves you very much,

18:04.333 --> 18:05.948
and he misses you right now.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.747
- Then why hasn't he come back for me?

18:11.382 --> 18:13.373
- I'm sure he wants to.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.760
Sometimes, people have to go away,

18:23.436 --> 18:25.051
even when they don't want to.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.558
(Audrey sighs)

18:31.402 --> 18:33.768
- Duke's resting.
He seems better.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.112
At least he stopped thinking
I was an enemy pirate.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.069
- So her influence, it wears off.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.156
- Unless it kills you first.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.491
- Well, then, she's right.
Why hasn't her dad come back?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.113
- Uh, maybe he's looking for her.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.661
Maybe he's injured, or worse.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.170
- I bet that her Troubles started
when her mother died.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.706
She felt abandoned.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.251
So maybe if we can find her father,
bring him back,

18:54.425 --> 18:57.212
we can convince her
that she's still important to him.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.468
- Let's hope she is.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.053
- She's already caused one death.

19:01.182 --> 19:02.763
That was an accident.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.757
We need to stop her Trouble.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.107
Ginger, we're gonna find your dad,
all right?

19:13.235 --> 19:14.520
But we need your help.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.610
Can you tell me about the people

19:16.739 --> 19:18.855
that he brought you here
to Haven to see?

19:19.033 --> 19:20.614
Maybe about the one
that was in the alley.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.071
- What do you mean?
The man or the woman?

19:23.204 --> 19:27.197
- What... There was a-a woman
in the alley?

19:27.375 --> 19:29.991
- Black hair and...

19:30.169 --> 19:31.909
funny black gloves.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.129
- Jordan.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.095
(sighs)

19:53.317 --> 19:55.933
- I remember our last meeting here.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.106
It was fun.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.775
- I figured we should at least
have a casual conversation

20:03.911 --> 20:06.573
before I take you in
for an official interrogation.

20:06.747 --> 20:07.782
- Hold on.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.790
- You said you didn't know anything
about the girl and her father,

20:10.960 --> 20:12.450
and then you tried to kidnap her?

20:12.628 --> 20:14.289
- Help her.
- You lied to me.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.545
- You think I want to?

20:17.007 --> 20:19.999
I care about you.
- Then tell me the truth!

20:21.846 --> 20:23.757
- We're just looking for her father.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.426
- So are we.
You knew that.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.468
So why?
Why work against me?

20:32.690 --> 20:35.352
Your friend eviscerated himself.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.735
- I know.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.020
It didn't exactly work out
the way we planned.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.315
(scoffs)

20:45.161 --> 20:48.244
- So you know the girl's Trouble is deadly.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.114
She just made Duke take a dive
off a railing at the Gull

20:52.251 --> 20:54.037
and he's the one person
in town she likes.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.831
- I'm sorry.

20:56.881 --> 21:01.625
- lf...
Maybe, if we can connect the girl

21:01.761 --> 21:04.719
and her father,
maybe we can stop her Trouble.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.756
- That's why we're looking
for him too, Nathan.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.549
- Then help me.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.058
Jordan, I...

21:16.984 --> 21:19.646
I need to trust you.
- And I want you to.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.775
But the Guard has a way
of doing things--

21:23.908 --> 21:27.867
- Where were the girl and her father
gonna stay in Haven?

21:33.417 --> 21:35.248
- Ginger has an uncle in town.

21:44.011 --> 21:47.174
- Uncle's name is Henry,
lives at 434 Dogleg Lane.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.295
- Jordan told you this?

21:48.474 --> 21:50.510
- Not sure I can trust her, Parker.

21:52.353 --> 21:54.685
- I know why you got in with the Guard
in the first place, Nathan.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.471
- Yeah. I was trying
to catch a killer.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.724
- You were trying to help me.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.977
So just... be careful.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.614
(door opening)

22:06.116 --> 22:08.823
- Hey, sorry to bother you.
I'm here about Morton Danvers.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.405
- You're one of them.

22:16.377 --> 22:17.958
- Yeah.
- l was the one who put Morton

22:18.087 --> 22:19.668
in contact with you guys,

22:21.340 --> 22:24.548
after Ginger started showing symptoms.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.712
- You heard from Morton?

22:25.886 --> 22:29.344
- What? No.
I already told you guys that.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.566
(phone rings)

22:42.611 --> 22:44.192
- Yeah, doc.
- You told me to call you

22:44.321 --> 22:47.313
if I found anything interesting
on our burned body.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.106
If you wanna come down here,
I can show you.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.822
- It's gonna have to be over the phone.
I gotta stay here.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.237
- Wood pulp-derived cellulose.

22:54.415 --> 22:57.873
lt's, um, used in making rope
and certain foods.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.375
The ﬁbres can get lodged in the lungs.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.291
I found a number lodged in Tommy's.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.789
They weren't granuloma-ed in yet.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.127
- English, please?

23:06.302 --> 23:08.543
- He got them in his lungs
right before he died.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.507
- Okay, I'm gonna need a list
of factories in the area

23:10.681 --> 23:13.047
where those fibres could've been from.
- I already found a few.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.932
| just emailed you some information
about that, if you wanna take a look.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.556
- Okay, sure, hang on.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.140
(computer game
beeping and whistling)

23:24.695 --> 23:26.481
- Ginger.
Shh.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.449
Just let me talk, okay?

23:29.617 --> 23:31.232
- You're the woman from the alley.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.904
- Yes.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.277
l was trying to help you.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.869
Your father sent me.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.578
- Why?
- He wants to see you.

23:39.710 --> 23:40.870
I can take you to him.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.752
- Audrey said
that she would take me to my dad.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.166
- She's lying.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.501
She knows what you can do,

23:46.675 --> 23:49.212
and she wants to put you away
somewhere all alone.

23:51.889 --> 23:53.971
Let me take you to your dad.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.261
Hm?

24:12.826 --> 24:14.032
- Ginger?

24:19.124 --> 24:20.500
Jordan!
(muffled whimper)

24:21.251 --> 24:23.913
What are you doing?
(muffled whimper)

24:24.046 --> 24:25.126
- What I have to.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.162
- Let her go.
- No.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.915
Put your gun down, and let us leave.
I don't want to hurt her.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.134
- My God.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.340
What is wrong with you?

24:34.515 --> 24:35.755
- What's wrong with me?

24:36.976 --> 24:39.308
Soon, nothing.
- Let her go!

24:41.480 --> 24:42.595
- Damn it.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.146
Nathan, you shouldn't be here!

24:45.317 --> 24:47.273
- Take your hands off her
and step away.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.362
Now!
- Okay.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.238
- Come on, I'm here.

24:53.409 --> 24:54.819
- Nathan, I'm sorry.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.284
I did this for us.
- You're not going anywhere.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.991
You're under arrest.
(handcuffs click)

25:00.165 --> 25:03.453
You're gonna tell us
why you want Ginger.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.541
(Audrey): Her father brought her
to Haven to help her.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.169
- She thinks her father
just abandoned her?

25:11.343 --> 25:12.799
- Yeah.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.007
How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.505
Little woozy.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.557
I am doing a hell of a lot better
than she is.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.391
- You sent me to her uncle
to get me out of the way,

25:25.566 --> 25:28.979
to make it easier for you to grab Ginger.
- I didn't send you anywhere.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.940
- And you lied about not knowing
where her father was.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.524
The Guard is holding him, right?

25:35.909 --> 25:38.651
Were you planning
to use the father as bait?

25:40.873 --> 25:44.161
We have enough
to hold you for a long time.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.795
You know what?
Don't even answer.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.914
I don't need to hear
any more of your lies.

25:57.181 --> 25:58.637
- I can make her tell us.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.724
People do what I say, right?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.305
If I ask her to tell me...

26:05.355 --> 26:07.141
she'll have to say.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.853
- No. It's too risky.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.234
- The kid just wants to find her dad.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.645
- She's a little girl, all right?

26:14.823 --> 26:17.439
I don't want her getting mixed up
in all of this. It's dangerous.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.609
- Yeah, but you know
what's more dangerous?

26:19.745 --> 26:22.111
Thinking that her father
abandoned her.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.821
Trust me.

26:24.958 --> 26:28.166
Look, just let me talk to her.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.127
- Okay, but be careful.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.168
- Okay.

26:35.469 --> 26:37.380
Hey.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.756
We're friends, right?

26:41.892 --> 26:45.259
Real friends,
not just 'cause you're making me.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.940
- Yeah.
- We're gonna let you do this.

26:51.568 --> 26:55.231
But if it's not going right,
you have to stop,

26:55.364 --> 26:58.697
and you have to promise me
that you will listen to me.

27:00.077 --> 27:01.738
- I promise.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.031
- Okay.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.213
- Tell me where my dad is.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.791
- Ginger, |--

27:13.924 --> 27:17.087
- Tell the truth now.
- Tell the truth...

27:18.595 --> 27:20.972
He's...

27:21.098 --> 27:23.305
on Waterman.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.173
The last house
on Waterman Lane.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.101
It's a Guard safe house.

27:28.272 --> 27:30.354
Nathan, don't go.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.597
You're gonna get hurt.

27:31.775 --> 27:32.981
- Who's guarding him?

27:33.110 --> 27:35.476
- Among others, Kyle Baron.

27:35.612 --> 27:38.524
Anyone gets close to that house,
he'll shoot to kill.

27:38.699 --> 27:41.065
- Ginger, ask her
why the Guard wanted you.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.202
- Why did the Guard want me?

27:47.666 --> 27:50.658
- In case Audrey Parker
became difficult.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.622
(gaSDS)

27:52.754 --> 27:57.168
We could use you to control her.
(Duke): Nathan...

27:58.260 --> 27:59.295
- Ginger.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.299
Tell her she has to answer my questions now.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.013
- You have to answer his questions.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.056
- Okay, Ginger.
Why don't you go upstairs?

28:16.069 --> 28:17.855
- You did good.

28:30.417 --> 28:34.001
- Audrey is immune to the Troubles.
Ginger couldn't make her do anything.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.002
How was Ginger gonna help you?

28:39.009 --> 28:42.251
- You're not immune to Ginger, Nathan.

28:43.430 --> 28:46.137
If we had Ginger, we'd have you.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.768
If we had you...

28:50.020 --> 28:52.477
we'd be able to control Audrey.

28:55.317 --> 28:59.481
But I really cared about you.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.525
I love--
- Why do you want to control Audrey?

29:04.117 --> 29:06.950
- Last time around,
when she was Lucy Ripley,

29:08.205 --> 29:10.366
she refused to go into the barn.

29:11.124 --> 29:14.161
She ran, almost got away.

29:15.879 --> 29:18.996
In case Audrey refused to go in this time,

29:21.593 --> 29:24.585
Ginger was gonna be
our insurance policy.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.924
- What's so important about the barn?

29:27.099 --> 29:29.181
(sighs)

29:29.351 --> 29:30.761
- Answer her.

29:32.980 --> 29:36.268
- It's not really a barn.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.015
It's way more than that.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.900
We just know that when she goes inside,

29:44.032 --> 29:49.026
both she and it disappear
for 27 years.

29:50.414 --> 29:54.953
And once they're both gone,
the Troubles in Haven stop.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.794
Haven becomes a Haven again.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.963
For the Troubled,
for you and me, Nathan.

30:07.431 --> 30:08.921
- How do you know that?

30:09.641 --> 30:12.678
- The Guard has been around a long time.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.606
- Why didn't you tell me
any of that before?

30:21.820 --> 30:26.063
- 'Cause I knew you'd try
to stop it from happening.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.069
- You're right.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.576
- It's not gonna happen.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.031
(sobs)

30:42.257 --> 30:44.498
- I just need one more piece of information.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.018
(car door slamming)

31:01.068 --> 31:03.480
(phone rings)

31:03.653 --> 31:06.315
- Baron.
(Ginger): Drop your gun and go to sleep.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.425
- Haven poli...

31:29.554 --> 31:30.839
Morton Danvers?

31:30.972 --> 31:32.678
- Where's my daughter?

31:32.808 --> 31:35.174
Is she okay?
- She's safe.

31:35.852 --> 31:39.015
But, you know,
she has a serious condition.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.098
- That's why we came here.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.897
Haven is supposed to be a safe place
for people like her.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.936
- Not now.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.529
Not with the Troubles.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.156
Now, she needs your help.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.363
She doesn't know how you feel.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.111
She thinks you don't care about her.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.325
- Don't care?

32:01.336 --> 32:02.701
- Then tell her.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.127
Duke, you can bring her in now.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.429
- Oh, thank God.
Thank God you're not hurt.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.136
I was so worried about you.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.141
I love you, Ginger.

32:20.439 --> 32:21.849
(whimpers)
- Daddy.

32:21.982 --> 32:24.849
Daddy, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.104
It's not your fault.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.610
None of it is.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.353
- I thought you wanted to leave me.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.606
- I never want to leave you.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.607
I brought you here to keep you safe.

32:35.620 --> 32:39.329
No one will ever take me away
from you again.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.618
I promise.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.122
(sobs)

32:44.796 --> 32:45.956
- Audrey!
- Hands up.

32:47.549 --> 32:48.629
Up against the wall.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.337
Don't say one word, Ginger.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.797
I'll shoot your dad
before you finish your sentence.

32:56.433 --> 32:57.513
(gunshot)

32:58.351 --> 32:59.602
Next one kills you, Crocker.

33:00.854 --> 33:02.264
- Go away.
I don't want you here.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.689
(laughs)

33:05.817 --> 33:07.353
- Look at that.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.851
Back in daddy's arms.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.488
Your Trouble's not working anymore.

33:11.781 --> 33:13.396
We were afraid that might happen.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.533
(Nathan): The girl isn't any good to you
without her Trouble.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.367
- Well, who's to say
it won't come back?

33:18.538 --> 33:21.371
You two, come with me.
The rest of you, face down on the floor.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.997
Really?
Wanna risk the lives of all these people

33:26.171 --> 33:27.707
on whether you're a better shot than me?

33:27.839 --> 33:29.704
- I've got Jordan in a jail cell.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.081
- So?

33:32.177 --> 33:35.214
- So you let them go,
I'll let her go.

33:38.975 --> 33:39.964
- Okay.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.392
That symbol on your arm
doesn't mean anything to you, does it?

33:44.105 --> 33:46.061
- Not anymore.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.184
- We'll keep that in mind.
(man): Kirk...

34:01.164 --> 34:02.279
(Nathan): We gotta move.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.493
Guard might still be after her.

34:04.626 --> 34:06.082
- Don't worry.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.786
I know places the Guard
will never find them.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.754
- Next place would be better.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.839
You'll see.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.379
- And safer.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.006
No more bad guys.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.471
- And no more pirates either.

34:22.352 --> 34:24.638
(Duke sighs)
- Yeah,

34:24.771 --> 34:26.762
but you're gonna
have your dad there,

34:27.607 --> 34:30.269
and you are gonna find
new pirates to play with.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.562
I promise.

34:32.070 --> 34:36.484
In fact, Iwas thinking
you could hold onto this for me.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.279
- Can you stay with us?

34:44.416 --> 34:46.532
- I think they need me here.

34:48.128 --> 34:50.369
Maybe I can come visit sometime.

34:53.216 --> 34:58.552
- Well, maybe you should come
with your daughter and a Mrs. Pirate.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.847
- Yeah, maybe.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.181
But right now, we gotta go, okay?

35:07.314 --> 35:08.724
- Okay.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.732
(phone beeps)

35:13.862 --> 35:15.944
- Lucassi got me some information on Tommy.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.653
It's on my desk.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.740
I wanna get this guy, Nathan.
- I'll be right there.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.538
Are you good?
- Me?

35:27.459 --> 35:28.539
Yeah.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.744
You just keep this town
from imploding till I get back.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.353
- These are the only factories
within 40 miles

35:50.482 --> 35:52.598
that produce that kind of cellulose.

35:52.734 --> 35:55.441
These four: still active.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.855
And look at this.

35:56.988 --> 36:00.401
The fifth closed in 2008.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.942
Somehow, two months ago,
the electric metre spiked.

36:04.537 --> 36:05.492
- Two months?

36:05.664 --> 36:08.030
- That was right before Tommy arrived,

36:08.166 --> 36:10.407
or right when Roslyn was killed.

36:10.543 --> 36:13.706
I think that the killer
has some kind of setup

36:13.838 --> 36:15.874
that involves a lot of electricity.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.816
- Struck a deal with the Guard.

36:36.986 --> 36:39.147
We got Danvers.
They get you.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.778
- Thanks.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.448
Do you believe
I really did care about you?

36:52.127 --> 36:54.914
- Yeah.
- But it doesn't matter, does it?

36:56.548 --> 36:58.755
It's always been
about that partner of yours.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.383
You'll never get over her,
will you?

37:06.641 --> 37:09.223
I did this to end the Troubles.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.973
I did this for us.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.188
- There is no us.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.769
- Yeah.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.860
I figured that part out.

37:31.124 --> 37:33.991
- Listen, Jordan might not even know
what she's talking about.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.909
- She sure sounded like she did,

37:36.087 --> 37:37.076
but whatever she knows,

37:37.255 --> 37:39.120
I'm betting that the bolt-gun killer
knows more.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.793
- You think he's alive?

37:40.925 --> 37:42.461
- I found out where he's hiding.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.210
Let's go.

38:02.989 --> 38:06.607
Wow, doesn't look
like anybody's been here for years.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.697
Which is exactly how you'd want
a hiding place to look.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.579
- Audrey...
- Jordan didn't say anything

38:13.750 --> 38:15.832
I hadn't already guessed,
Nathan.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.367
If I'm supposed
to fix the Troubles

38:17.504 --> 38:19.415
by going into
some magic barn, then--

38:19.547 --> 38:20.878
- No.

38:23.092 --> 38:26.300
Just promise
we'll try and find another way.

38:26.888 --> 38:28.924
- Okay.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.797
Let's start by getting this guy first.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.859
(wind rushing, waves crashing)

38:55.333 --> 38:57.039
(door creaks open)

39:42.088 --> 39:43.828
What is this place?

39:57.979 --> 40:00.391
Nathan, it's still draining.

40:01.858 --> 40:03.894
Somebody was just here.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.417
(938%)
It's Tommy.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.042
Nathan, that is Tommy's skin.

40:29.218 --> 40:31.254
Oh, my God.

40:43.858 --> 40:44.893
- Grady.

40:50.657 --> 40:52.864
I bet Roslyn's skin
is here somewhere too.

40:52.992 --> 40:55.369
- That's why he burned the bodies,

40:55.495 --> 40:58.407
so we wouldn't know
that they had been skinned first.

41:04.837 --> 41:07.453
But why would anybody--

41:07.590 --> 41:10.002
- So he could take Tommy's place,
work by our side.

41:11.260 --> 41:14.172
So he could become Grady,
throw us off.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.297
Roslyn, to get close to you
in that cellar.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.466
- He wears people's skin?

41:20.603 --> 41:22.434
- That's why he uses a bolt gun.

41:23.773 --> 41:27.015
Makes a small hole. No exit wound.
Leaves the skin intact.

41:29.237 --> 41:32.650
Native Americans around here
have a legend about skinwalkers.

41:32.782 --> 41:36.240
It's a man who can wear a skin like a suit.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.406
I bet it's based on a Trouble.

41:39.539 --> 41:43.578
- So if he was wearing Tommy's skin
on that boat, and Tommy's skin is here...

41:43.710 --> 41:45.701
- It means he survived the explosion.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.498
