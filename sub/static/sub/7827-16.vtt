10:58.866 --> 10:59.992
Can't talk. See Flanders.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.995
-Later sex.
-(groaning)

11:03.079 --> 11:05.247
Bless the grocer
for this wonderful meat,

11:05.331 --> 11:07.416
the middleman
who jacked up the price.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.126
And let's not forget
the humane but determined boys

11:09.210 --> 11:10.461
over at the slaughterhouse.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.463
Hiya, Flanders.
Ooh, dinner.

11:12.546 --> 11:14.507
May I join you?
(grunts)

11:16.258 --> 11:19.011
-(gasps)
-Mmm.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.055
(gasps)

11:21.138 --> 11:22.515
(chuckling) Homer,
I'd love to chitty-chat,

11:22.598 --> 11:24.558
but tonight's the night
I do my charity work.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.186
Uh, yeah.
A judge made me do that once too.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.188
Stupid lack
of public urinals.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.108
Hey, just so you don't
have to suffer alone,

11:32.191 --> 11:33.192
I'm coming with you!

11:33.275 --> 11:35.986
Oh-- Heh, well--

11:36.070 --> 11:38.864
(chuckles)
That sounds super duper.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.039
Oh, you poor,
unfortunate man.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.375
Let's get you out of
those clothes immediately.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.877
And we'll do whatever we can
about the smell.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.046
But I-- All right.

11:54.130 --> 11:58.801
Oh, come on!
We've been here for 15 minutes.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.220
Can't you see they're
sucking the life out of us?

12:01.303 --> 12:04.849
Homer, maybe you'd have
more fun at Moe's tonight.

12:04.932 --> 12:08.227
Ah, for some reason, Moe's always
closed on Wednesdays.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.814
"And then they realized
they were no longer little girls.

12:13.315 --> 12:16.026
They were little women."
(sniffs)

12:21.282 --> 12:22.992
Come on. Come on!

12:23.075 --> 12:24.535
Just give 'em the slop
and let's get out of here.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.537
Oh, I can do it
faster than that!

12:26.620 --> 12:29.707
Mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm.
Mmm, mmm.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.792
Wow!
Look at that enthusiasm!

12:31.876 --> 12:33.294
This is front-page material.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.467
Homie, I'm very proud
of you.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.303
But don't you think you're spending
too much time with Ned?

12:42.386 --> 12:44.472
Your family
needs you too.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.265
Oh, of course you'd say
something like that, Marge.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.350
You've hated Ned for years.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.936
In fact, you wanted to
bash his head in with a pipe.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.313
That was you!

12:52.396 --> 12:55.107
Love, Marge.
Don't hate. Love.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.151
The Flanders are
a bunch of geeks, man.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.278
The "Flandereses"
are not geeks!

12:59.361 --> 13:01.530
Okay. Rod and Todd are.
And the wife has a thing for me.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.283
But she hides it behind a mask
of low-key hostility.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.577
But we've got to
give this thing a chance.

13:06.660 --> 13:10.915
I want the two families to take
a trip together this weekend.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.500
-No way, Jose.
-Yes way.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.502
Don't worry, Bart.
It seems like every week

13:14.585 --> 13:16.545
something odd happens
to the Simpsons.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.297
My advice is to ride it out,

13:18.380 --> 13:20.090
make an occasional
smart-aleck quip,

13:20.174 --> 13:22.218
and by next week, we'll be back
to where we started from,

13:22.301 --> 13:23.886
ready for another
wacky adventure.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.347
<i>-Ay, caramba!</i>
-That's the spirit.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.308
Don't worry.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.477
I brought my
"Rappin' Ronnie Reagan" tape.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.896
It always makes
the trip go faster.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.815
<i>♪ Well, well, well ♪</i>

13:35.898 --> 13:38.108
<i>♪ W-w-w-w-w-w-well, well, well♪</i>

13:38.192 --> 13:40.486
(chuckling)
You know something?

13:40.569 --> 13:42.947
He did say "well" A lot.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.783
<i>♪ Well, well, well</i>
<i>w-w-well, w-w-well ♪</i>

13:45.866 --> 13:50.538
<i>♪ Well, well, w-w-w-well</i>
<i>well, well, well, well ♪</i>

13:50.621 --> 13:52.873
More. No, no,
keep going.

13:52.957 --> 13:56.544
More. More.
Right there. Let her go.

13:58.462 --> 14:01.507
Okay, let's go boating!

14:01.590 --> 14:05.845
-How are my boys doin', Homer?
-They're fine.

14:05.928 --> 14:09.807
There. I hope the children
enjoy my special fruit punch.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.476
We got the recipe from
the fruit punch advisory board.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.396
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.
Our boys don't eat sugar.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.274
But why would the advisory board
give us bad advice?

14:18.357 --> 14:21.402
-No sugar!
-(both groaning)

14:21.485 --> 14:24.238
Thank you,
but we're not allowed.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.449
Ah, it's okay.
There's no sugar in pixie sticks.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.535
-Trust me.
-Okay. Hmm.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.248
-Don't hog it all, smelly head!
-Go to hell, zit face!

14:34.331 --> 14:37.501
-Give me that sugar cane!
-(both groaning)

14:37.585 --> 14:39.378
(cackling)

14:41.380 --> 14:43.632
I'd like to propose a toast
to the coming together

14:43.716 --> 14:47.094
of the Simpsons
and the Flanders.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.263
If this were
a more perfect world,

14:49.346 --> 14:52.266
we'd all be known
as the Flimpsons.

14:52.349 --> 14:56.896
So here's to
my best friend, Ned.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.524
(sighs)
Well, sir,

15:00.608 --> 15:03.068
my entire family
is very touched and--

15:03.152 --> 15:05.863
-Food fight!
-BART: Yeah!

15:05.946 --> 15:06.864
HOMER: <i>♪ Da-na-na</i>
<i>na-na-na-na, na-na ♪</i>

15:06.947 --> 15:08.282
Mmm.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.867
(all shouting)

15:11.535 --> 15:12.745
(grunting)

15:14.705 --> 15:16.415
-Whatcha doin'?
-We're headin' back.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.542
Todd's got Zesty Italian
in his eye.

15:18.626 --> 15:22.421
Okay. But at least let me take
the boat out for one last spin.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.007
-Oh, I don't know.
-Too late!

15:25.090 --> 15:28.761
(groans) Oh, Lord,
please give me the strength

15:28.844 --> 15:31.013
to endure
Homer Simpson's friendship.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.557
-(boat engine revving)
-(Homer shouting)

15:33.641 --> 15:34.767
(crashes)

15:34.850 --> 15:37.561
Hmm, your car.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.648
Boy, what are the odds, huh?
(chuckling)

15:40.731 --> 15:43.651
Cheers to Homer Simpson
for all his recent charity work!

15:43.734 --> 15:44.735
ALL: Yea!

15:44.818 --> 15:45.778
(grunting)

15:45.861 --> 15:47.655
Jeers to this rusty tailgate.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.491
(whistling hymn)

16:02.044 --> 16:04.004
There's Homer.
There's Homer too.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.464
(screaming)

16:05.547 --> 16:07.383
That's also Homer.
That's Homer!

16:07.466 --> 16:09.969
Huh?
(groans)

16:10.052 --> 16:12.721
-(shouts)
-What's the matter, Ned?

16:12.805 --> 16:15.599
I-- I think I hate
Homer Simpson.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.767
(gasps)

16:16.850 --> 16:18.060
(yells)

16:18.143 --> 16:22.356
Marge, I think I
hate Ted Koppel.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.734
No, wait. I find him
informative and witty.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.611
Night.
(snoring)

16:31.865 --> 16:34.368
-Off the rim!
-Oh! Almost.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.703
Boy, that was close.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.705
Hey, what's up
for today, Neddy?

16:37.788 --> 16:39.707
Uh-- (sighs)

16:39.790 --> 16:42.292
Ah, Homer, we're gonna visit
the boys' grandmother.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.836
Family only, you know?

16:43.919 --> 16:45.671
-Right. No reporters.
-(Ned sighs)

16:45.754 --> 16:48.966
No. I-- I-- I mean
just the Flanders family.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.428
Oh, okay.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.516
Oh, boy! Grandma!

16:57.599 --> 16:59.768
-We're not going anywhere.
-But you said--

16:59.852 --> 17:03.272
Uh, sometimes to keep from
hurting someone's feelings,

17:03.355 --> 17:05.649
we have to say things
that aren't exactly--

17:05.733 --> 17:07.609
Lies make
baby Jesus cry.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.112
(sighs)

17:13.073 --> 17:16.160
Neddy! Neddy!

17:16.243 --> 17:19.163
Let's get in a quick nine
down at the Pitch 'n' Putt.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.582
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

17:21.665 --> 17:24.543
Neddy! Neddy!

17:24.626 --> 17:27.087
-(groaning)
-He's gaining on us!

17:27.171 --> 17:29.006
-I'm scared!
-(crying)

17:29.089 --> 17:30.591
Come on, Ned!
Move this thing!

17:30.674 --> 17:33.135
I can't! It's a Geo!

17:33.218 --> 17:35.387
(grunting)

17:36.430 --> 17:38.432
(screaming)

17:39.850 --> 17:42.102
-(groaning)
-(groaning)

17:42.186 --> 17:43.395
(groaning)

17:43.479 --> 17:45.397
Hmm. I guess
he didn't see me.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.441
We did it!
We got rid of--

17:47.524 --> 17:50.569
(siren blaring)

17:51.945 --> 17:53.739
(chuckling)
I told you, officer.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.658
I'm not hepped up
on goofballs.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.702
Yeah, right.

17:58.786 --> 18:02.498
Ned Flanders.
I never would have imagined.

18:02.581 --> 18:06.085
(gasping)

18:06.168 --> 18:08.253
Oh-- Oh-- Ah--

18:08.337 --> 18:09.588
Oh-- Oof!

18:09.671 --> 18:12.341
High as a kite, everybody!
Goofballs!

18:13.759 --> 18:17.471
Yeah, where's your messiah
now, Flanders? Ah.

18:17.554 --> 18:21.266
(bells tolling)

18:21.350 --> 18:24.186
Oh, I can't do it, Maude.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.522
I can't face
their accusing eyes.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.357
Oh, don't worry, Ned.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.193
This is a house
of love and forgiveness.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.697
-There he is, Ned Flanders.
-The fallen one.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.698
The evil one.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.534
I bet he's the one that wrote
"Homer" all over the bathroom.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.078
Oh, I think
we should leave.

18:41.161 --> 18:45.582
Hey, Flanders, over here!
I got us some kick-ass seats!

18:45.666 --> 18:48.210
(moans)

18:51.421 --> 18:53.257
(clearing throat)

18:53.340 --> 18:56.301
Before I get started
on today's sermon, entitled

18:56.385 --> 18:58.846
"What Ned did,"

18:58.929 --> 19:03.350
I'd like to publicly congratulate
Homer Simpson on his recent charity work.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.602
-(applauding)
-(kissing)

19:05.686 --> 19:07.604
I live to give.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.564
(moans)

19:08.647 --> 19:10.774
That's beautiful.
We appreciate the kisses.

19:10.858 --> 19:16.113
Now, let us bow our heads
in a silent prayer of thanksgiving.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.495
(nose whistling)

19:26.915 --> 19:29.042
(whistling continues)

19:32.504 --> 19:35.549
Stop it! Breathe through
your damn mouth!

19:35.632 --> 19:37.176
-Oh!
-(gasping)

19:37.259 --> 19:38.802
Oh, can't you see
this man isn't a hero?

19:38.886 --> 19:42.556
He's annoying.
He's very, very annoying!

19:42.639 --> 19:44.516
Well, Ned Flanders
is just jealous.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.102
Ah, the guy's hepped up
on goofballs.

19:47.186 --> 19:51.356
Let's sacrifice him
to our god!

19:51.440 --> 19:53.525
Come on. We did it all
the time in the '30s.

19:53.609 --> 19:57.154
(chattering)

19:57.237 --> 20:00.908
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

20:00.991 --> 20:01.950
(gasps)

20:02.034 --> 20:05.537
How dare you talk about
Ned Flanders like that.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.749
He's a wonderful,
kind, caring man.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.501
Maybe even more so than me.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.421
There have been times
when I lost patience with him,

20:14.504 --> 20:16.423
even lashed out at him,

20:16.506 --> 20:21.553
but this man has turned
every cheek on his body.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.723
If everyone here
were like Ned Flanders,

20:24.806 --> 20:27.184
there'd be no need
for heaven.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.186
We'd already be there.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.105
(group sighs)

20:32.189 --> 20:35.943
(clears throat)
Um--

20:36.026 --> 20:39.738
Well, I think we all owe
Ned a heartfelt apology.

20:39.821 --> 20:42.032
We were wrong
to doubt him.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.243
-Hey, that guy's right!
-Yeah.

20:44.326 --> 20:47.913
(chattering)

20:47.996 --> 20:50.207
That was a very nice thing
you did, Homie.

20:52.042 --> 20:55.796
(sniffs)
Thank you.

20:55.879 --> 20:58.465
Thank you so much,
Homer.

20:58.548 --> 21:01.969
You really are a--
(sniffs)

21:02.052 --> 21:05.681
-You're a true friend.
-Right back at ya, buddy.

21:05.764 --> 21:09.184
(moans) Now, how about
that game at the Pitch 'N' Putt?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.144
Just try and stop me.

21:11.228 --> 21:14.189
I don't get it, Lise. You said everything
would be back to normal.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.608
But Homer and Flanders
are still friends.

21:16.692 --> 21:20.737
Yeah. Maybe this means the
end of our wacky adventures.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.201
Guess what, everyone!

21:26.285 --> 21:27.661
My great-uncle Boris died

21:27.744 --> 21:29.413
and left us
his old country house!

21:29.496 --> 21:32.249
There's only one catch.
They say it's haunted.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.792
But I'm sure
we can prove 'em wrong

21:33.875 --> 21:36.086
by spending the weekend there.

21:36.169 --> 21:39.089
-Hididilly-ho, neighbor!
-Get lost, Flanders.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.133
Okilly-dokilly.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.636
(both sigh)

21:44.720 --> 21:47.639
-(wolf howling)
-(bat screeching)

21:47.723 --> 21:51.518
HOMER: See, I told ya.
