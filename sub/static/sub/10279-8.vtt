Subtitles subXpacio

00:06.142 --> 00:09.397
We had a break in the system
for a couple of hours around noon.

00:09.426 --> 00:13.444
- But now a second cycle...
- Did they clear the Eisenhower yet?

00:13.611 --> 00:16.494
- Forget about it.
- I swear I took out $40 yesterday.

00:16.659 --> 00:19.376
Are we doing this?
Because I have a pilonidal cyst waiting.

00:19.542 --> 00:21.047
She's finishing her last patient.

00:21.213 --> 00:23.511
Chuny, Nolemad's PTT is 96.

00:23.677 --> 00:26.351
Hold up heparin for an hour,
then reduce the rate to 1100.

00:26.518 --> 00:28.146
- Ok. After the party.
- How long is that?

00:28.314 --> 00:29.776
Five minutes. Don't go anywhere.

00:29.944 --> 00:32.467
Stick this back in the fridge.
It's melting.

00:32.502 --> 00:35.955
- Malik, I'm waiting on the L-spine series.
- She had a couple sutures to go.

00:35.990 --> 00:38.214
- Does she know we're waiting?
- It's a surprise.

00:38.422 --> 00:40.135
- What surprise?
- Dr. Finch's last day.

00:40.343 --> 00:42.099
- Already?
- Yep, and you owe me $10...

00:42.264 --> 00:43.979
...for the massage and facial we got.

00:44.062 --> 00:46.149
It's not here. Can I pay you tomorrow?

00:46.317 --> 00:48.990
- Whatever. I offer rolling credit.
- Are you backing up?

00:49.157 --> 00:53.166
No, kicking butt. Storm knocked out
six traffic lights south of Division.

00:53.334 --> 00:55.841
There's three sets of multiple MVAs
all tucked in.

00:56.007 --> 00:59.182
Construction on Wacker's all mud.
A crane fell in the river.

00:59.349 --> 01:03.276
Hey, Abby, when you get a chance, I
need a repeat CBC and a Beta HCG in 4.

01:03.442 --> 01:06.367
- Where are you going?
- Come get me when she gets here.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.747
- Me too.
- Wait. You leave, other people leave.

01:08.914 --> 01:10.962
- No one will be here.
- I have to pee.

01:11.128 --> 01:12.464
- Well, then pee fast.
- Gallant.

01:12.632 --> 01:16.642
I got a disimpaction for you in 3. Go help
Cleo with her sutures when you're done.

01:16.808 --> 01:20.944
- You're gonna supervise my first couple?
- Don't send him. She'll just take longer.

01:21.154 --> 01:23.241
All right.
Just clean the old girl out, then.

01:23.409 --> 01:26.792
- Haleh, Medical Records needs help.
- I don't work for Medical Records.

01:26.959 --> 01:29.966
- Basement is flooding. Losing charts...
- Then call Housekeeping.

01:30.134 --> 01:32.640
- ... payroll.
- Be right there.

01:32.806 --> 01:35.314
Dr. Weaver? Michael Gallant,
third-year on ER rotation.

01:35.521 --> 01:38.696
I know. Frank, did Maintenance get
those sandbags out in the bay yet?

01:38.864 --> 01:40.326
- Doubt it.
- I didn't see any.

01:40.534 --> 01:43.876
Call them. I don't want water coming
through the doors. Then help Haleh.

01:44.043 --> 01:47.134
- Can we talk about this warning letter?
- I write a lot of letters.

01:47.301 --> 01:50.099
I missed journal club last night.
I had another commitment.

01:50.266 --> 01:51.561
We all have commitments.

01:51.771 --> 01:54.694
ER conferences
are a requirement of your rotation.

01:54.903 --> 01:57.785
- Is she here yet?
- Hey, Abby, can you call Telecom?

01:57.994 --> 02:01.211
The switch is in the basement.
I don't want internal lines going down.

02:01.377 --> 02:03.509
- Do you know the number?
- Find it.

02:03.674 --> 02:06.096
I had a mandatory exercise
involving my scholarship.

02:06.264 --> 02:08.269
Financial aid offers multiple meetings.

02:08.437 --> 02:12.739
- No, no. This is Army Reserve duty.
- Okay. All right, just review the notes.

02:12.906 --> 02:15.871
- You'll remove the letter from my file?
- Yeah. Get me a schedule.

02:16.039 --> 02:19.588
Stab wound to the abdomen en route.
Five to 10, depending on traffic.

02:19.798 --> 02:22.597
Prep Trauma 2, break out
a cutdown tray, and page Surgery.

02:22.763 --> 02:26.105
- So did I miss the cake or what?
- We're still waiting for her to finish.

02:26.272 --> 02:28.862
Messenger dropped this by for you.
Genetadine Labs.

02:29.029 --> 02:31.118
What, are you having yourself cloned?

02:31.284 --> 02:33.665
Genetadine.
That's the cloning place, right?

02:33.833 --> 02:37.299
- They mainly do DNA analysis.
- Yeah, cloning.

02:41.601 --> 02:43.983
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:45.737 --> 02:47.149
- You need something?
- No.

04:07.501 --> 04:09.793
- I said, any history of heart disease?
- You didn't.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.293
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

04:11.461 --> 04:13.419
- Yes, I did.
- Do you get spiral CTs...

04:13.585 --> 04:15.045
- ... to rule out PEs now?
- Hold on.

04:15.254 --> 04:19.214
- How many heart attacks have you had?
- Just one. Angioplasty fixed me right up.

04:19.380 --> 04:22.381
- Angioplasty?
- Until this morning when I woke up.

04:22.547 --> 04:25.924
So instead of seeing a doctor,
you stayed on your feet directing traffic.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.175
- Aren't you a doctor?
- Now it's too late.

04:28.716 --> 04:30.217
- What, I'm gonna die?
- No.

04:30.384 --> 04:33.384
I just meant any damage you did
to your heart is already done.

04:33.593 --> 04:34.843
I'm gonna be okay, right?

04:35.010 --> 04:39.470
I need you to stay overnight
for observation, and stay on the monitor.

04:39.678 --> 04:44.387
And no. We're still doing V/Qs because
they keep promising us a better scanner.

04:44.554 --> 04:46.889
What kind of bedside manner is that?

04:47.056 --> 04:51.349
The idiot has had an MI after stenting,
he stands out in the rain for eight hours.

04:51.515 --> 04:54.266
- I don't think yelling's gonna help.
- It might.

04:54.432 --> 04:57.351
You know, you might want to think
about getting out of the ER.

04:57.517 --> 05:01.311
That advice is only about
nine years too late, but thank you.

05:01.477 --> 05:03.936
Seriously. You never talked
to patients like that.

05:04.102 --> 05:05.895
I've had an epiphany.

05:06.103 --> 05:07.187
Dr. Greene.

05:07.354 --> 05:10.022
Medevac coming in. Diverting
from Children's. Near-drowning.

05:10.230 --> 05:11.522
- Did he arrest?
- I don't know.

05:11.688 --> 05:14.272
He must be pretty sick
if they're flying him in the rain.

05:16.565 --> 05:19.524
- It's supposed to be a surprise.
- I hate chocolate mint.

05:19.691 --> 05:22.567
- Yeah, I didn't pick it.
- You think I should stick around?

05:22.734 --> 05:27.360
- They're going to gather everyone soon.
- Hey, you're not supposed to see that.

05:27.569 --> 05:30.236
I'll be upstairs. Page me
if anyone needs me for anything.

05:30.403 --> 05:34.237
- I'm sure that we will.
- Carter, isn't it? John Carter?

05:34.405 --> 05:36.739
- And you would be?
- The girl by the pool.

05:36.906 --> 05:39.531
Oh, right, yeah. The one
without the answering machine.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.241
It broke in the move.
I haven't had time to go shopping.

05:42.407 --> 05:44.533
- That's convenient.
- Hey, I called you.

05:44.783 --> 05:47.450
- Did not.
- I spoke to your manservant, Harry.

05:47.616 --> 05:51.285
Henry? The night butler?
He didn't say anything about it.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.869
It is the 21 st century.
You can get voicemail.

05:54.077 --> 05:56.579
- You need to get better help.
- You volunteering?

05:56.746 --> 05:59.079
- Any benefits?
- Well, there's the outfit.

05:59.246 --> 06:01.456
- Dream on.
- Hey, Carter.

06:01.621 --> 06:03.497
- Hey, how'd it go?
- He did good.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.582
Couple pounds of stool.
Only gagged once.

06:05.748 --> 06:08.040
Yeah, those old ladies
can surprise you, huh?

06:08.249 --> 06:11.875
- Yeah. How do I know when I'm done?
- You develop a feel for it.

06:12.084 --> 06:14.334
- Where's the stab wound?
- Should be here by now.

06:14.501 --> 06:17.586
Call Dispatch. Make sure it's rolling up.
Gallant, you're with me.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.628
Don't worry about it.
It will only hurt for a day or two.

06:21.545 --> 06:23.671
Do you think
I'm mean to the patients?

06:23.837 --> 06:27.296
- Only the ones who deserve it.
- What about the ones who don't?

06:27.464 --> 06:30.006
- You're nicer than I am.
- That's not much solace.

06:30.173 --> 06:31.798
Sorry.

06:35.675 --> 06:37.759
Oh, my God.

06:37.925 --> 06:39.551
- I distinctly heard him.
- Who?

06:39.802 --> 06:43.386
The weatherman this morning.
He said, "Party cloudy, chance of rain. "

06:43.553 --> 06:45.052
Well, he warned you.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.596
Twelve-year-old boy.
One-story fall and near-drowning.

06:48.762 --> 06:51.222
Moderate respiratory distress,
crackles on the right.

06:51.388 --> 06:52.721
- What's his name?
- Daniel.

06:52.888 --> 06:55.348
- Daniel, having trouble breathing?
- I let go of him.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.723
- Who?
- Joey. I couldn't hold on.

06:57.890 --> 06:59.891
His brother.
They were playing by the river.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.725
- Where is Joey?
- Rescue's still looking for him.

07:02.892 --> 07:04.601
All right, let's slide him out.

07:04.934 --> 07:07.060
Here it comes.

07:08.102 --> 07:10.603
Must be a police car.

07:10.770 --> 07:14.938
- Does it usually take so long in the rain?
- Shouldn't.

07:15.687 --> 07:18.606
- You need a jacket?
- No. We won't be out here long.

07:18.773 --> 07:21.606
- I can go get one for you if you-
- I'm fine.

07:23.607 --> 07:26.942
Sorry I haven't looked at your file.
You're military?

07:27.107 --> 07:29.568
- Yes, ma'am. U.S. Army Reserve.
- ROTC?

07:29.734 --> 07:33.735
No, I did a year of active duty.
Now I'm in a scholarship program.

07:33.903 --> 07:36.445
So work in the ER
might not be so crazy to you.

07:37.111 --> 07:39.738
I think it's a whole different kind
of crazy, ma'am.

07:41.279 --> 07:44.781
- There you are. I was looking for you-
- No, listen, I need to see you.

07:44.989 --> 07:47.449
I'm gonna pick up my son
and drive to your office.

07:47.615 --> 07:50.115
Well, if you're not there,
I'll get another attorney.

07:50.282 --> 07:52.575
You're damn right I'm upset.
You told me not to-

07:52.742 --> 07:56.534
You told me not to fight this thing. Now
Roger's gonna try to hang me with it.

07:56.701 --> 08:01.077
- Fine. I'll see you in a half an hour.
- What happened?

08:01.286 --> 08:04.537
The DNA analysis shows
that I'm not Reece's biological father.

08:04.704 --> 08:06.580
Oh, God, Peter. I'm so sorry.

08:06.746 --> 08:09.955
I told myself a long time ago
it wouldn't matter, that I'm his father.

08:10.122 --> 08:13.415
- I won't let that son of a bitch change it.
- I'm going with you.

08:13.582 --> 08:15.958
No. They're getting ready
to throw a party for you.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.542
I don't give a damn about a party.
Let's go.

08:18.709 --> 08:21.126
- Frank, where the hell is this thing?
- What thing?

08:21.293 --> 08:23.418
- Cleo, are you done?
- I'll call to say goodbye.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.419
- Where's the stab wound?
- I don't know.

08:25.627 --> 08:28.628
I was sloshing around downstairs.
I'm billing you for these shoes.

08:28.795 --> 08:31.464
- Find out what happened.
- Dr. Weaver, it's here.

08:31.671 --> 08:35.006
Twenty-four-year-old female pedestrian,
hit by a car in a crosswalk.

08:35.173 --> 08:38.215
- Miss, can you tell me your name?
- Jill. He hit my dog.

08:38.381 --> 08:42.674
Probable LOC. GCS, 13.
BP,100/75. Pulse, 95.

08:42.884 --> 08:44.467
- Where were you stabbed?
- What?

08:44.633 --> 08:47.302
- No, she was hit by a car.
- Wait, where's the stab wound?

08:47.468 --> 08:48.968
- What stab wound?
- Get her inside.

08:49.136 --> 08:52.344
Your dispatch needs to get it together.
We didn't know you were coming.

08:52.512 --> 08:54.846
The one we're waiting on
is over half an hour late.

08:55.013 --> 08:58.389
Dr. Weaver, Unit 37 got slammed
by an SUV in a downed intersection.

08:58.555 --> 09:00.348
- Ashville and Western.
- Who's 37?

09:00.514 --> 09:01.806
- Our stab wound.
- Pickman.

09:01.973 --> 09:04.558
- Rescue is trying to cut him out.
- Is she okay?

09:04.725 --> 09:07.641
Don't know about the driver.
The pregnant woman is in bad shape.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.726
- The stab wound's pregnant?
- And bleeding.

09:09.892 --> 09:13.309
- Okay. Wait! I'm going with you!
- What, you're leaving?

09:13.477 --> 09:17.353
She could be a dropsy. Have Carter
take this case. I'll be right back.

09:17.562 --> 09:20.521
- What do I do?
- Get in.

09:22.063 --> 09:24.147
I couldn't hold him.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.189
Daniel, I need to listen.

09:26.356 --> 09:28.315
He's retracting.

09:28.482 --> 09:30.983
ABG. He's decreased on the right.

09:31.149 --> 09:32.942
BP's 80 over palp.

09:33.108 --> 09:35.150
- Got ahold of the parents?
- Firefighters did.

09:35.317 --> 09:36.985
Get on the radio and make sure.

09:37.484 --> 09:39.194
Sucking chest wound.

09:39.360 --> 09:43.102
Abby, Vaseline gauze,
Elastoplast, chest tube tray,

09:43.137 --> 09:44.654
and page Surgery.

09:44.821 --> 09:48.655
Daniel, you got a hole in your chest
sucking in air every time you breathe.

09:48.823 --> 09:50.781
We need to plug it up, all right?

09:50.947 --> 09:53.740
BP's 110/70. Still no sats.

09:53.907 --> 09:55.908
- Ready?
- Yep.

09:56.658 --> 09:58.867
- That should be better.
- They find Joey?

09:59.659 --> 10:01.784
I don't know.
We're gonna ask the firemen.

10:01.951 --> 10:05.953
- Please, they have to find my brother.
- Everything's gonna be okay. All right?

10:06.119 --> 10:07.203
10 blade.

10:22.832 --> 10:25.335
Stay close to me
and watch where you're going.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.043
- You okay?
- Yeah. Both airbags deployed...

10:28.210 --> 10:31.835
- ... but he has a bad seat belt side.
- Sir, do you know where you are?

10:32.003 --> 10:35.045
- The middle of the street.
- Lake had a flail chest. We moved him.

10:35.212 --> 10:37.588
- Pickman's in back with an open tib-fib.
- She conscious?

10:38.171 --> 10:40.172
Yeah, but her patient might
be hemorrhaging.

10:40.339 --> 10:44.174
Listen to his lungs on the way in.
You might need to needle him.

10:46.090 --> 10:48.258
Okay, got it!

10:48.675 --> 10:50.300
You okay, Doris?

10:50.467 --> 10:53.469
I messed up my leg bad. It's open,
but I got a pulse in the foot.

10:53.635 --> 10:56.135
- I had to move it myself.
- I need you to stand back!

10:56.303 --> 10:59.095
- I'm an emergency physician at County.
- Good for you.

10:59.303 --> 11:02.846
Stand back! We need to open up
this can. You help us.

11:03.014 --> 11:04.805
What's the status of your patient?

11:04.972 --> 11:08.015
A 28-year-old woman,
eight months pregnant, mugging victim.

11:09.015 --> 11:10.265
Son of a bitch!

11:10.474 --> 11:12.016
- You okay?
- I cut my hand!

11:12.183 --> 11:14.892
Gallant, help them.
You have vitals?

11:15.059 --> 11:17.309
- Okay, again!
- BP, 90/60.

11:20.853 --> 11:23.187
- Grab yourself anything?
- I couldn't reach the bag.

11:23.353 --> 11:26.354
- Okay, get her out, then 10 of morphine.
- I'll get the board.

11:26.521 --> 11:29.313
- Get the C-collar. What's her name?
- Vicki.

11:29.479 --> 11:33.814
Vicki, my name is Dr. Weaver.
Where are you having pain?

11:33.940 --> 11:35.316
All over.

11:36.940 --> 11:40.026
- Can you see the bone?
- Careful. Careful.

11:40.191 --> 11:43.693
Does it feel like you're
having contractions?

12:04.491 --> 12:06.034
Brody!

12:06.992 --> 12:08.702
No! Don't touch him!

12:09.869 --> 12:11.659
Gallant!

12:12.226 --> 12:14.104
Brody! Brody, are you okay?

12:14.271 --> 12:17.483
He's unresponsive.
Get a monitor, and let's roll him.

12:17.649 --> 12:20.404
Airway's patent.
Checking for a carotid.

12:20.571 --> 12:23.533
He's not breathing. No pulse.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.161
- You know CPR?
- Yes.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.080
Start compressions.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.710
- I'll do it!
- No! I need you to check on that woman.

12:30.877 --> 12:32.546
- He's in my unit!
- Check on her!

12:32.713 --> 12:35.757
Zadro, I need the defibrillator
and an ambu-bag.

12:35.925 --> 12:38.177
- Coming.
- Come on, breathe!

12:38.345 --> 12:42.225
That was stupid. That was really stupid.
You could have both been electrocuted.

12:42.351 --> 12:44.854
- Stop.
- Sorry. It was instinct.

12:45.022 --> 12:46.564
I told you not to touch him.

12:46.731 --> 12:49.109
You're okay if your feet
don't touch the ground.

12:49.318 --> 12:51.739
Guess what? It's raining.
Water conducts electricity.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.741
- I'm all right.
- You were lucky.

12:54.909 --> 12:57.621
- Still no pulse. Bag him.
- Got it.

12:58.247 --> 13:00.750
- It's charging to 200.
- She's okay.

13:00.917 --> 13:02.837
- Clear.
- The tires are insulating the rig.

13:03.005 --> 13:06.091
I can't get in.
That hot wire keeps lighting it up.

13:06.257 --> 13:08.762
- Is she conscious?
- Yeah. She's in labor.

13:08.928 --> 13:10.930
You go back and tell her
it's gonna be okay.

13:11.098 --> 13:12.850
- He's one of my men!
- Do it.

13:12.976 --> 13:14.812
Three hundred. Clear.

13:15.937 --> 13:17.273
- He's venting.
- Got it.

13:17.441 --> 13:19.108
- You got a rhythm?
- Yeah.

13:19.276 --> 13:20.485
Intubate him.

13:20.652 --> 13:24.240
A hundred of lido down the ET
until you get a line.

13:24.407 --> 13:27.120
That's two milligrams a minute.

13:27.912 --> 13:30.416
Please help me. I'm bleeding.

13:30.583 --> 13:32.794
Hang in there.
We're gonna get you out of there.

13:32.961 --> 13:36.090
Vicki, it's Dr. Weaver again.
Did you feel a shock?

13:36.299 --> 13:38.594
- No, I don't think so.
- Is he breathing?

13:38.760 --> 13:43.142
We got him back for now. Vicki, tell me
if you're bleeding from your vagina.

13:43.475 --> 13:45.520
The baby's not moving.

13:45.687 --> 13:49.734
I need you to feel down there
and tell me if you're bleeding.

13:54.115 --> 13:55.616
Hold on! I'm coming in.

13:55.742 --> 13:58.913
- No, no. I can't let you do that.
- Her baby's probably in distress.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.335
First rule of an accident site,
don't create more casualties.

14:02.502 --> 14:03.712
Casualties?

14:03.836 --> 14:07.675
We need an engineer out here. They're
not showing fault in the power grid.

14:09.093 --> 14:12.223
- It looks like a fault to me.
- That's what they're telling me.

14:12.390 --> 14:16.187
- Hey, I told you not to do that!
- Just turn the damn power off!

14:17.814 --> 14:19.983
Did you hit your head,
lose consciousness?

14:20.150 --> 14:24.364
I don't know. I remember walking in the
street, seeing Gordon lying in the rain.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.199
- Gordon?
- Her dog.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.078
BP's 100/40.

14:28.286 --> 14:31.416
He kept scratching at the door.
I had to take him for a walk.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.543
- Breath sounds equal.
- No hemotympanum.

14:33.711 --> 14:36.172
- But I wanna get a head CT.
- Is this the hit-and-run?

14:36.381 --> 14:38.008
He didn't stop?

14:38.175 --> 14:41.263
- Pulse ox is 94 on 4 liters.
- Miss...

14:41.472 --> 14:44.559
- ... can you describe the car that hit you?
- It was silver, I think.

14:44.726 --> 14:45.936
- Are you sure?
- No.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.398
- Does that hurt?
- Yes.

14:49.065 --> 14:53.029
- Did you take my dog to the vet?
- I'm afraid your dog died.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.616
Full trauma panel, C-spine,

14:55.699 --> 14:57.994
chest, AP pelvis, Foley,
give her 10 of morphine.

14:58.161 --> 15:02.416
HemoCue's 9.8. Let's get
an ultrasound before a CT.

15:02.584 --> 15:04.961
- Dr. Greene is using it.
- Go see if he's done.

15:05.128 --> 15:09.217
- What kind of dog was he?
- He was a terrier mix.

15:09.593 --> 15:13.097
Those are the best kind.
You know, he probably went really fast.

15:13.265 --> 15:16.185
Don't hear a dorsalis pedis pulse.
Go get me a Doppler.

15:16.352 --> 15:18.313
Check an ICON
before she goes to Radiology.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.316
Little fluid in Morrison's pouch.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.944
- Can we have that when you're done?
- It's all yours.

15:23.153 --> 15:25.865
Page Pedes Surgery.
Another crit in 20 minutes.

15:26.033 --> 15:30.455
- You want to cath urine?
- On a CPK and another portable chest.

15:30.622 --> 15:33.083
Daniel, you're doing much better.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.004
We need to keep an eye on you
for the next couple hours...

15:36.171 --> 15:38.132
...just in case you need any surgery.

15:38.299 --> 15:40.551
- He's dead, isn't he?
- What?

15:40.677 --> 15:43.139
Joey. He drowned.

15:43.306 --> 15:46.769
- I don't know. They're looking for him.
- He didn't want to go.

15:46.935 --> 15:48.687
- Where?
- To the river.

15:48.854 --> 15:50.690
He was scared,
but I called him a baby.

15:50.815 --> 15:53.486
- You didn't know this would happen.
- He's only 6.

15:53.695 --> 15:56.532
- Parents are on their way.
- They're gonna hate me now.

15:56.699 --> 16:01.163
- They're gonna be happy you're safe.
- It should have been me.

16:04.125 --> 16:07.631
- Watch the monitor. His heart's irritable.
- Looks like regular sinus rhythm.

16:07.797 --> 16:10.801
- Okay, let's go! Shut the door.
- Okay.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.685
Hey, stay clear of that rig!

16:18.186 --> 16:19.521
- Hey, hold on.
- It's okay.

16:19.688 --> 16:22.817
- Is she okay?
- Hypertonic contractions.

16:22.984 --> 16:25.781
BP's dropping, 68/40.

16:25.946 --> 16:28.201
That's way too low, right?

16:28.408 --> 16:30.704
- What?!
- Nothing, Vicki.

16:30.871 --> 16:34.417
I need you to be quiet.
I just need to listen.

16:39.007 --> 16:41.594
- What was that?
- It's the power line!

16:43.763 --> 16:46.768
- Fetal heart tones are 70.
- Is that bad?

16:47.685 --> 16:50.481
Maybe the transformer will blow out
and kill the line!

16:54.862 --> 16:56.572
Dr. Weaver!

16:56.739 --> 16:59.242
I need your help.
Can you get in here safely?

16:59.409 --> 17:02.747
- Yeah, I'd have to jump.
- Okay, then jump.

17:06.711 --> 17:07.753
Got it.

17:07.921 --> 17:11.718
Search through the cabinets.
Find me an amp of cardiac lidocaine.

17:11.885 --> 17:14.054
- Lidocaine?
- Just do it.

17:14.847 --> 17:19.103
Vicki, your placenta is detaching.
It's bleeding into your uterus.

17:19.311 --> 17:21.397
Oh, God!

17:21.564 --> 17:24.444
Hey! I told you to stay away
from the damn vehicle!

17:24.569 --> 17:26.988
She's bleeding out!
Why is the power still on?

17:27.156 --> 17:28.615
There's a crew on the way!

17:29.492 --> 17:32.663
The only way to stop the bleeding
is to deliver your baby surgically.

17:32.872 --> 17:36.918
- It's too early.
- it's not. Thirty-six weeks is full-term.

17:37.086 --> 17:39.214
Take me to the hospital!

17:39.379 --> 17:42.927
Honey, I want to. I want to,
but I can't right now, all right?

17:43.218 --> 17:45.347
Shut it off from the plant!

17:45.555 --> 17:47.975
It's supposed to burn through
on its own.

17:48.143 --> 17:50.647
They need to authorize the shutdown.

17:50.854 --> 17:55.110
Vicki. Vicki, I need you to listen to me.
I'm an emergency physician.

17:55.277 --> 17:58.823
I'm trained to perform a C-section
only after the mother has died.

17:59.032 --> 18:01.911
And in about 15 minutes,
that's what's gonna happen.

18:02.120 --> 18:06.167
Meanwhile, your baby is in danger.
But I might be able to save you both...

18:06.334 --> 18:09.463
...if we take the baby now
and stop your internal bleeding.

18:09.630 --> 18:13.010
Are you willing
to take that risk with me?

18:13.468 --> 18:16.932
- I think so.
- You sure?

18:19.017 --> 18:21.854
- You've observed a C-section?
- I haven't done OB before.

18:22.773 --> 18:25.276
- Well, you'll be ahead of the curve.
- Lidocaine.

18:25.485 --> 18:27.905
- Know how to take a blood pressure?
- Yeah.

18:28.071 --> 18:32.245
Okay, take one. I need it
every couple of minutes.

18:32.954 --> 18:35.415
Squeeze that saline bag...

18:35.583 --> 18:39.213
and find me every 4-by-4
and bandage we have.

18:39.380 --> 18:42.383
Okay, Vicki. Vicki, hang in there.

18:42.550 --> 18:47.641
I'm gonna give you a shot in your spine
that will numb your belly and legs.

18:48.935 --> 18:51.437
All right, find me a 10 blade.

18:52.523 --> 18:53.564
That's a scalpel.

18:53.774 --> 18:56.569
When's the last time you've done this?

18:59.908 --> 19:03.579
- Peter, the DNA test was inevitable.
- There has to be a precedent.

19:03.746 --> 19:07.459
Not in a custody battle between two
men without genetic ties to a child...

19:07.625 --> 19:09.921
...they raised.
It's stepfather versus stepfather.

19:10.088 --> 19:14.259
- I'm not his stepfather. I'm his father.
- Sorry. Father.

19:14.469 --> 19:17.807
Until Carla died, Roger never questioned
that Peter was Reece's dad.

19:17.972 --> 19:20.602
- Irrelevant.
- She put my name on the birth certificate.

19:20.769 --> 19:23.439
If she were alive,
Carla couldn't contest the paternity.

19:23.647 --> 19:25.317
- But Roger can?
- Ironically, yes.

19:25.484 --> 19:29.489
Peter, you are going to have to allow
Roger to resume partial visitation.

19:29.697 --> 19:31.992
- No. No way.
- As we speak...

19:32.159 --> 19:35.497
...Roger's attorney is drafting
a pre-trial motion for visitation...

19:35.665 --> 19:36.958
...until this is resolved.

19:37.626 --> 19:41.881
You don't stipulate now, you'll lose that
hearing and be painted as the heavy.

19:42.048 --> 19:45.343
I'm the heavy? He's trying to take
my son from me and I'm the heavy?

19:45.511 --> 19:48.432
You need to be seen by the judge
as someone who's interested...

19:48.598 --> 19:50.475
- ... in Reece's well-being.
- I am.

19:50.642 --> 19:52.938
Good. Then you need to listen to me.

19:53.606 --> 19:55.400
You have to stay focused
on the endgame.

19:55.566 --> 19:59.948
And not let anger or fear
impede that goal.

20:02.158 --> 20:04.870
Vicki, stay awake.
I need you to stay awake.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.083
- BP's dropping. 50.
- Spike another liter.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.210
- "Spike"?
- Take the pointy end of the bag...

20:09.418 --> 20:12.005
...and hang it up.
Hey, you! Firefighter!

20:12.172 --> 20:15.718
- Lopez!
- Lopez, I need more light!

20:15.885 --> 20:18.681
Scotty! Scotty, turn up the brights!

20:18.848 --> 20:20.225
I need you over here. Get out.

20:20.392 --> 20:22.353
- You're doing a vertical incision?
- Yeah.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.147
Be ready with that hemostat.

20:24.314 --> 20:28.318
We're gonna clamp the big bleeders and
pack up everything else with gauze.

20:28.945 --> 20:30.780
All right, here we go.

20:41.212 --> 20:44.174
I need you to put your hands there
and pull back.

20:44.341 --> 20:47.428
- Where?
- Just do what I do from the other side.

20:51.643 --> 20:53.895
Vicki, you feel that?

20:54.063 --> 20:57.066
- Just some pulling.
- Okay.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.738
Okay, fascia's exposed.

21:01.572 --> 21:04.911
Okay, separate the rectus,
down to the fascia.

21:05.078 --> 21:06.955
All right, more retraction.

21:07.247 --> 21:08.958
- Okay.
- Pull back.

21:10.293 --> 21:13.756
- My baby.
- Hang on. Hang on, Vicki.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.944
Okay. I'm into the peritoneal cavity.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.175
Here's the uterus. Give me the scalpel.

21:22.977 --> 21:25.438
You want me to let go?

21:25.981 --> 21:29.151
- Scanner 1 will be ready in 10.
- Do a sound on the chest.

21:29.319 --> 21:33.325
They're gonna take you upstairs and
scan your whole body for other injuries.

21:33.491 --> 21:37.790
I want you to tell the nurse if you need
any more pain medication, okay?

21:37.998 --> 21:40.584
I'm sorry about your dog.

21:41.836 --> 21:43.338
What?

21:43.463 --> 21:46.008
- "He probably went really fast. "
- She was upset.

21:46.218 --> 21:49.471
She could have solid-organ rupture.
The dog's the least of her concerns.

21:49.638 --> 21:52.642
It can be traumatic to lose a pet,
especially if you saw it happen.

21:52.809 --> 21:54.145
- What was his name?
- Who?

21:54.353 --> 21:55.646
Your dog.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.735
Happy. He was a Lhasa apso, and he got
run over by a car when I was 11.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.156
Oh, did he go really fast?

22:02.322 --> 22:03.783
No. Crushed his pelvis.

22:03.950 --> 22:06.202
- In the river earlier today...
- Someone drowned?

22:06.369 --> 22:10.250
- Brother of the boy in Trauma 2.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Did they find him?

22:10.417 --> 22:13.379
- Not yet.
- You can't leave anything around here.

22:13.446 --> 22:16.298
- What?
- Some derelict stole my PalmPilot.

22:16.466 --> 22:18.927
- Maybe you misplaced it.
- I had it two minutes ago.

22:19.096 --> 22:21.975
- Dr. Carter.
- Alger. Alger, what are you-?

22:22.141 --> 22:26.146
It's your grandmother. I found her in
the driveway. I think she broke her hip.

22:26.314 --> 22:27.691
Get a gurney!

22:27.898 --> 22:29.526
There's a cut on her head.

22:29.693 --> 22:33.156
- She was driving?
- She went during the break in the storm.

22:34.324 --> 22:36.578
- Gamma?
- Oh, John, it's terrible. It hurts.

22:36.744 --> 22:38.705
Okay, I know it does. Just lay still.

22:39.665 --> 22:40.708
- Did she fall down?
- I don't know.

22:40.875 --> 22:43.210
But the right leg is shortened
and externally rotated.

22:43.379 --> 22:45.423
- I think I broke my hip.
- I think you did too.

22:45.589 --> 22:48.720
- What happened to your head?
- I thought it was best if I drove home.

22:48.886 --> 22:52.016
I didn't realize how much
I was bleeding, so I slipped.

22:52.181 --> 22:54.810
- You were in an accident?
- Well, I don't-

22:54.978 --> 22:58.274
It was raining. I couldn't see.
I think I hit a dog.

22:59.900 --> 23:04.515
- Where were you driving?
- It was supposed to be clear and sunny.

23:05.946 --> 23:08.698
- Retract the bladder anteriorly.
- Like that?

23:08.865 --> 23:10.575
More. Watch your fingers.

23:10.950 --> 23:14.203
- I'm opening the lower uterine section.
- Is that the amniotic fluid?

23:14.370 --> 23:16.540
Yeah. I'm in.

23:18.082 --> 23:20.000
It looks like a lot of blood.

23:20.167 --> 23:24.545
Auto recloser is stuck open
or something. He's trying to bypass it.

23:24.712 --> 23:28.256
- I don't care. Just shut it down!
- It ain't that simple, lady!

23:28.424 --> 23:29.466
- Damn it!
- What?

23:29.634 --> 23:32.053
I cut a uterine vein.
Another clamp now!

23:32.261 --> 23:36.264
- BP's dropping. 60 systolic.
- Keep squeezing in that saline.

23:36.391 --> 23:38.934
- Doesn't she need blood?
- I don't have any blood!

23:39.100 --> 23:40.476
- Fundal pressure.
- What?

23:40.644 --> 23:43.438
Push the baby down towards me
from the top of the uterus.

23:43.604 --> 23:45.816
- Okay. Right here?
- Yes. Yes. Now.

23:45.982 --> 23:48.943
- Is the other ambulance here?
- It's pulling up.

23:49.110 --> 23:53.488
Call County General. Say we need an
O.R., OB Attending, and a neonatologist.

23:58.952 --> 24:00.786
- Grab the bulb syringe.
- Okay.

24:00.911 --> 24:03.247
Suck out his nose and mouth.

24:08.210 --> 24:10.628
- Is there an exit wound?
- Sure is. Blew off his boot.

24:10.837 --> 24:12.297
A transthoracic current pathway.

24:12.464 --> 24:14.591
- You saw it?
- He lit up like a Christmas tree.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.010
I need the room.
Post-arrest electrocution.

24:17.135 --> 24:19.261
- What's open with a monitor?
- He's a fireman.

24:19.428 --> 24:22.806
Daniel, we're gonna shuffle you
to another room.

24:23.014 --> 24:26.392
CK is normal. Tox screen
tested positive for marijuana.

24:26.559 --> 24:29.270
- Marijuana? Were you smoking dope?
- C-spine, chest, pelvis.

24:29.395 --> 24:30.688
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.

24:30.854 --> 24:33.191
For getting high
and taking Joey out to the river?

24:33.398 --> 24:35.860
- I didn't smoke today.
- I knew it. I knew it.

24:36.026 --> 24:38.362
We saw the river on the news.
We wanted to see it.

24:38.527 --> 24:41.197
- "We"? Joey's 6 years old.
- He said he wanted to see it.

24:41.406 --> 24:43.784
- You're gonna blame it on him now?
- No, it's my fault.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.160
- You're damn right it's your fault!
- Hold on.

24:46.369 --> 24:48.664
I'm Dr. Greene. We need
to get Daniel into a room.

24:48.829 --> 24:51.499
Then I'll come out
and brief you on your son's condition.

24:51.665 --> 24:54.167
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- You heard from the fire department...

24:54.334 --> 24:56.836
- ... about Joey?
- Not yet. They're still searching.

24:57.170 --> 24:59.672
- Between these clamps, right?
- Yes.

25:00.131 --> 25:04.344
- Vicki! Vicki, are you still with me?
- Is that my baby?

25:04.511 --> 25:06.845
Yes, honey. You have a boy.

25:07.513 --> 25:09.681
He's crying. Do you hear that?
He's crying.

25:09.889 --> 25:12.516
Could be stronger.
We need to get a heart rate.

25:12.683 --> 25:15.978
Okay, 10 minutes!
They're gonna shut the entire grid off!

25:16.187 --> 25:17.814
Why can't they do it right now?

25:18.023 --> 25:22.233
They have to warn emergency facilities
they're going off-line.

25:23.652 --> 25:25.904
- Okay. It's 88, I think.
- You think or you know?

25:26.112 --> 25:27.322
It's 88.

25:27.490 --> 25:30.949
- One-minute Apgar is seven out of 10.
- It'll get better, right?

25:31.159 --> 25:35.704
We need to wrap him up.
He needs fluids, oxygen, maybe blood.

25:35.871 --> 25:38.165
You said we didn't have any blood.

25:38.582 --> 25:41.209
You need to get him to the hospital.

25:41.710 --> 25:43.545
Nine minutes!

25:43.711 --> 25:45.171
Vicki?

25:45.338 --> 25:46.964
Vicki, wake up!

25:47.131 --> 25:51.886
Damn it! She's exsanguinating!
I have to clamp off the uterine artery.

25:54.888 --> 25:56.932
Okay, I'm going!
Get out of the way!

25:57.099 --> 25:59.392
- No!
- It's this or I throw him to you!

25:59.559 --> 26:02.561
- No! No! Tell him to stop!
- Go.

26:15.406 --> 26:17.909
- Is he okay?
- I got him.

26:18.117 --> 26:21.287
- Okay, get him out of here. Go!
- Let's go. Let's go.

26:21.453 --> 26:25.041
Transformer just blew.
Does that mean the circuit's dead?

26:25.457 --> 26:27.751
I'm gonna sew this up.

26:27.917 --> 26:30.337
You won't feel anything.

26:32.922 --> 26:35.007
You okay?

26:36.635 --> 26:38.760
I see a lot of fathers
who come in here...

26:38.926 --> 26:42.431
...and they're upset when their kids
are hurt or missing.

26:42.597 --> 26:44.557
Sometimes they say things
they don't mean.

26:44.766 --> 26:49.937
He's not my father. He's my stepfather.
Joey's the real kid.

26:50.105 --> 26:53.398
- And that makes you...?
- A pain in the ass.

26:54.107 --> 26:55.859
Did it come back?

26:55.983 --> 26:58.778
- What?
- You were waiting for a chest x-ray.

26:58.945 --> 27:02.616
Right. Lungs re-expanded.
Tube's in a good position.

27:02.824 --> 27:05.911
I'm repairing the chest laceration now.

27:06.077 --> 27:07.578
- Mom?
- So he's fine?

27:07.745 --> 27:11.040
For now. He'll need to be monitored
in the PICU.

27:11.248 --> 27:15.627
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't have been out there.

27:16.336 --> 27:18.172
- Yeah, I know.
- Mrs. Pendry-

27:18.338 --> 27:21.591
Why did you take him there?
You didn't think. You never think.

27:21.758 --> 27:24.469
I know. It should have been
me that drowned.

27:24.635 --> 27:27.971
- Yes. But it wasn't, was it?
- Mrs. Pendry-

27:28.138 --> 27:30.515
- It was Joey.
- Mrs. Pendry...

27:30.974 --> 27:33.602
...I need to talk to you outside.

27:36.896 --> 27:38.814
In here.

27:42.484 --> 27:43.527
What are you doing?

27:43.736 --> 27:45.820
My son is missing. No one can find him.

27:45.987 --> 27:49.156
Right. And your other son is in there
who needs your comfort and love.

27:49.324 --> 27:51.825
This is none of your business.

27:51.993 --> 27:54.870
You want him to feel responsible?
Guess what? He already does.

27:55.078 --> 27:57.330
You want him to hurt?
He already hurts.

27:57.497 --> 28:00.460
You want him to hate himself,
keep it up.

28:01.084 --> 28:02.335
- They found him.
- What?

28:02.501 --> 28:04.378
- He's stuck down river.
- Is he all right?

28:04.545 --> 28:06.922
I don't know.
They're trying to get to him.

28:07.630 --> 28:10.050
It'll be okay, Peter.

28:10.259 --> 28:11.927
We don't know that.

28:12.135 --> 28:14.972
I see you two together. I know.

28:18.683 --> 28:20.018
What did you do that for?

28:21.394 --> 28:23.646
You wanted to?

28:25.189 --> 28:26.523
Are you expecting someone?

28:28.190 --> 28:30.568
- Yeah?
- Peter.

28:30.735 --> 28:33.322
No, Peter! This doesn't have
to go any further, man!

28:33.530 --> 28:37.033
Look, please.
Just hear me out, okay?

28:38.035 --> 28:39.411
Come on.

28:41.954 --> 28:45.458
Look, Reece lived under my care
and my roof for most of his life.

28:45.666 --> 28:48.835
All I'm asking for is some kind
of arrangement that recognizes that.

28:49.044 --> 28:51.963
- It's too late for that.
- Look, come on, brother.

28:52.379 --> 28:55.091
- You want to put him through a trial?
- I'm keeping my son.

28:55.383 --> 28:57.969
- I guess I'll see you there.
- Yeah, you will.

28:58.135 --> 29:01.929
There's been a search going on ever
since the boy's brother was pulled out...

29:02.096 --> 29:03.264
...earlier this evening.

29:03.431 --> 29:05.349
Swift Water 43.
County General waiting.

29:05.516 --> 29:06.892
- Open, channel two.
- Copy that.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.602
- Is he alive?
- They don't know.

29:08.769 --> 29:12.897
Frank, call the burn unit. Brodoff is
going to the O.R. for a fasciotomy first.

29:13.064 --> 29:14.567
Is that your electrocution?

29:14.733 --> 29:18.068
Compartmental pressure is almost 60.
Otherwise, he's lucky.

29:18.279 --> 29:21.071
- Anyone want anything from the store?
- It's pouring outside.

29:21.281 --> 29:24.534
Malik and Yosh don't like
the lounge coffee. It hurts their stomach.

29:24.659 --> 29:27.493
- Grande vanilla cappuccino.
- It's okay. It's on me.

29:27.661 --> 29:30.664
He's in arrest, but they're flying him in.
ETA,15 minutes.

29:30.831 --> 29:32.665
- Does he have a pulse?
- P.E.A.

29:32.833 --> 29:35.042
Luka, our new med student's
coming in BOA.

29:35.209 --> 29:37.920
Weaver opened up a pregnant woman
trapped in an ambulance.

29:38.045 --> 29:39.713
- Opened up?
- C-section.

29:39.879 --> 29:42.383
- In the field?
- She'll have some explaining to do.

29:42.550 --> 29:44.592
- Can I get you something, Abby?
- Nope.

29:44.801 --> 29:47.220
- Cigarettes?
- No, thanks.

29:47.387 --> 29:48.805
- What's that?
- What?

29:48.972 --> 29:51.141
- What time is it?
- Seven.

29:51.307 --> 29:52.767
- What's wrong?
- Give me your bag!

29:52.976 --> 29:54.686
- Let me see inside your bag.
- No!

29:54.894 --> 29:55.979
What are you doing?

29:56.146 --> 29:59.440
My PalmPilot alarm goes off at 7
to remind me to take my Vioxx.

29:59.606 --> 30:01.901
- Come on, let go of her bag.
- After I see inside.

30:02.109 --> 30:03.402
- Frank!
- For chrissakes.

30:09.740 --> 30:12.786
Fabulous! First you steal it,
then you break it!

30:12.952 --> 30:15.329
- That's not yours.
- I'm calling the police.

30:15.495 --> 30:17.289
Hey, hold on. This is a mistake.

30:17.455 --> 30:20.125
Oh, yeah! Yeah, my stuff just leapt
into her bag!

30:21.376 --> 30:23.127
Nicole?

30:23.419 --> 30:26.755
And it's not just me, pal,
she's ripping off everybody. Ask Abby.

30:27.673 --> 30:29.632
Nicole!

30:29.842 --> 30:33.887
- I need some help here! Newborn!
- Luka, the baby.

30:34.053 --> 30:36.681
Dr. Weaver says he might need
a transfusion.

30:37.390 --> 30:38.433
Is he premature?

30:38.724 --> 30:41.477
No. We gave him O-2. He needs an IV.

30:41.643 --> 30:43.777
Elevate her legs. Cycle the dynamap.

30:43.812 --> 30:46.398
Tilt the monitor toward me. I got it.

30:46.565 --> 30:49.150
- I said, I got it. How bad is that hand?
- It'll keep.

30:49.317 --> 30:51.318
Sats are plummeting.
She's not moving air.

30:51.485 --> 30:53.697
Stop! Airway blocked!

30:53.904 --> 30:56.616
- I thought you had to move her!
- Need to protect her airway.

30:56.783 --> 30:58.034
Cricoid pressure.

31:00.994 --> 31:03.330
Cover!

31:04.831 --> 31:07.459
Exposed flexor tendon.
You're gonna need a hand surgeon.

31:07.626 --> 31:09.627
I need to control the scene.

31:09.793 --> 31:11.711
Get somebody else.

31:11.878 --> 31:14.381
All right, I'm in.

31:14.589 --> 31:16.883
Bag her! Let's go!

31:17.050 --> 31:21.638
Draw a milligram of epi
and have atropine standing by.

31:21.805 --> 31:23.598
- Get in!
- No, I'm good.

31:23.765 --> 31:27.704
- No, you're not!
- Go on, get out of here. Come on.

31:41.845 --> 31:44.723
People think kids don't listen
to their parents, but they do.

31:44.890 --> 31:47.516
If they tell you you're nothing,
you think you're nothing.

31:47.725 --> 31:50.978
- How cold do you think that water is?
- I don't know, 40.

31:51.103 --> 31:52.521
Hope it's colder than that.

32:00.903 --> 32:02.321
- You got a pulse?
- No. No pulse.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.906
No spontaneous resps.
GCS, 3. For real.

32:05.115 --> 32:07.075
- How long was he under?
- I don't know.

32:07.242 --> 32:09.578
We found him in debris a mile
from where he fell in.

32:09.745 --> 32:12.538
- I thought it was P.E.A.
- No. Asystole the whole flight.

32:13.289 --> 32:14.707
Hey, Gam.

32:14.874 --> 32:17.041
Does it still hurt?

32:17.584 --> 32:20.462
- On a scale of one to 10-
- It hurts, John.

32:20.629 --> 32:22.630
- Did she get the full amount?
- In two doses.

32:22.797 --> 32:24.798
- Give her four more of morphine.
- Okay.

32:24.966 --> 32:27.885
But I'll put her on the monitor.

32:28.051 --> 32:30.762
Well, Gam,
you definitely broke your hip.

32:30.888 --> 32:33.764
Looks like an impacted fracture
of the femoral neck.

32:33.889 --> 32:35.850
Please speak English, John.

32:36.225 --> 32:40.020
I need to get a more sophisticated scan
to determine if you need surgery or not.

32:40.729 --> 32:43.356
I should have listened to you
about the car. I'm sorry.

32:43.523 --> 32:45.275
Gamma...

32:46.151 --> 32:49.111
...I think you hit more than just a dog.

32:51.406 --> 32:54.115
You also hit a young woman.

32:54.241 --> 32:57.285
She's okay.
We're taking care of her here.

32:57.452 --> 33:00.580
I called Mr. Stern
in case you need an attorney.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.832
- I hit a girl?
- Yeah.

33:05.292 --> 33:07.711
- I left. I drove away.
- You didn't know.

33:07.878 --> 33:10.547
But I should have checked to see.
Oh, my God!

33:10.713 --> 33:15.384
Gam, you were confused, okay?
It's crazy out there. Visibility's terrible.

33:15.551 --> 33:18.178
I'm gonna be right back,
then I'll take you for that scan.

33:18.386 --> 33:21.473
- What's wrong? What is it?
- Nothing. It's just another patient.

33:21.931 --> 33:24.225
- Page Surgery. I need a HemoCue.
- What happened?

33:24.434 --> 33:27.145
- Dropped her sats in the elevator. 88.
- Any chest pain?

33:27.310 --> 33:30.188
No. Just passed out. BP's 80/60.

33:30.355 --> 33:32.649
I can't see the cords.
I need a fiber-optic scope.

33:32.816 --> 33:35.943
ABG, set up the ultrasound,
and mix up 7500 units of heparin.

33:36.111 --> 33:38.988
There's a lot of fluid in here.
Could be pulmonary edema.

33:39.155 --> 33:43.200
Grab the thrombolytics box.
DIC panel. Troponin, CK, EKG...

33:43.366 --> 33:45.535
- ... and a portable chest.
- Two large-bore IVs.

33:45.702 --> 33:49.162
Nuke the saline in the microwave.
Get that collar off him.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.123
- We'll need a bear-hugger.
- Coming.

33:51.290 --> 33:52.624
- Tube's out.
- God, he's blue.

33:52.791 --> 33:56.711
Number 51/2 uncuffed ET tube.
Suction.

33:56.877 --> 33:59.213
Still no pulse.
Asystole on the monitor.

33:59.422 --> 34:02.590
- Joey, wake up. Baby, wake up.
- Ma'am, you need to back up.

34:05.218 --> 34:06.928
- Oh, my God!
- What is that?

34:07.095 --> 34:09.347
- What is that?
- River water.

34:09.513 --> 34:12.766
Cords are closed.
I need a fiber-optic laryngoscope.

34:12.933 --> 34:15.643
Prep the neck.
I might have to crike him.

34:16.687 --> 34:18.772
Daniel, get back to bed.
I'll come get you.

34:19.230 --> 34:21.774
Can't get a line,
and he's totally clamped down.

34:21.940 --> 34:23.484
Two cutdown trays.

34:23.650 --> 34:26.402
Daniel, now. Lily, can you...?

34:26.612 --> 34:29.447
- You heard him, out! Get out of here!
- You too.

34:29.656 --> 34:31.074
- What?
- Out!

34:31.239 --> 34:34.284
Cross-match her for 6 units.
Two units FFP.

34:34.368 --> 34:36.036
Stick her and send a clot.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.496
- Is the O.R. ready?
- They're waiting for you.

34:38.706 --> 34:41.416
- I have an emergency C-section.
- No kidding. I can see that.

34:41.581 --> 34:45.128
Coburn called me, screaming.
I said she must have heard wrong.

34:45.252 --> 34:49.047
28-year-old woman trapped in an
ambulance, abrupted and hemorrhaging.

34:49.214 --> 34:52.050
And ER docs don't perform C-sections
until the mother arrests.

34:52.217 --> 34:54.719
- She will if we don't get her upstairs.
- BP's up to 90.

34:54.885 --> 34:56.887
Have dopamine standing by.
Add a coag panel.

34:57.096 --> 35:00.140
I got it from here, Kerry.
Go back in the ER and stay dry.

35:00.307 --> 35:03.226
I don't want you dying of pneumonia
before your public flogging.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.770
- I could've let everybody die.
- That's the safe play.

35:05.937 --> 35:09.399
Now if she lives, you're a hero.
If she doesn't, I don't know you.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.860
The baby.

35:14.027 --> 35:15.737
Chuny, where's the baby?

35:15.904 --> 35:20.116
He's pinking up.
They're waiting for the NICU fellow.

35:20.283 --> 35:22.660
Nice save, Dr. Weaver.

35:24.369 --> 35:26.664
One milligram of vitamin K, I.M.

35:26.830 --> 35:30.333
Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment,
0.5 percent.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.751
Good neuro check?

35:31.917 --> 35:34.837
Moves all four symmetrically.
Lungs are clear. No retractions.

35:35.004 --> 35:38.882
- You get a heel-stick?
- Glucose, 70. Pulse, 120.

35:43.387 --> 35:45.388
You did it.

35:49.557 --> 35:51.518
Okay.

35:51.893 --> 35:56.022
CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine
and a bilirubin.

35:58.941 --> 36:00.859
Luka?

36:01.568 --> 36:02.819
Can I talk to you?

36:02.986 --> 36:05.154
- Bradying down to 60.
- Hurry up, she'll arrest.

36:05.363 --> 36:07.740
I'm in, I think.

36:07.907 --> 36:09.575
Sats are falling.

36:09.783 --> 36:12.787
There's too much edema. Is Mark
done yet? I need that fiber-optic.

36:12.911 --> 36:14.788
- Air in the stomach.
- What are you doing?

36:14.955 --> 36:17.165
Try to suction the cords.
Inflate the balloon.

36:17.331 --> 36:21.585
- Keep it in, you'll have a better shot.
- No, just- Pull back really slowly.

36:22.878 --> 36:25.088
There we go. Slowly, slowly.

36:25.255 --> 36:27.215
Little more.

36:27.424 --> 36:30.051
All right, there are the cords.
Give me the tube.

36:39.100 --> 36:42.187
Open a crash cart. Draw one
of atropine and an amp of epi.

36:42.353 --> 36:43.562
Got it.

36:43.729 --> 36:45.438
Come on, hold on.

36:45.606 --> 36:48.691
89, 90.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.777
Pulse ox is climbing.

36:50.944 --> 36:53.488
Good breath sounds. Nice work.

36:54.572 --> 36:55.573
Saline's running.

36:55.739 --> 36:59.242
Dilute two mgs of atropine
and one mg of epi down the tube.

36:59.409 --> 37:01.328
How high does the temp go
on that vent?

37:01.494 --> 37:02.955
Forty centigrade.

37:03.121 --> 37:06.415
Set tidal volume at 200 on 100 percent.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.709
Still no pulse and no pressure.

37:08.876 --> 37:10.920
All right, keep warming him.

37:11.086 --> 37:14.547
We got to get that Foley in.
We're gonna irrigate the bladder.

37:15.006 --> 37:17.383
We're gonna save this one.

37:19.135 --> 37:21.428
- You want me to...?
- No, no, he can stay.

37:21.637 --> 37:25.682
Cycle the lavage fluids.
Repeat the temp, max out the blower.

37:25.848 --> 37:28.434
- Cardiac activity on the monitor.
- What?

37:28.601 --> 37:30.645
- Looks like P.E.A.
- That's good.

37:30.852 --> 37:33.147
Amp of bicarb.
Charge the paddles to 60.

37:33.272 --> 37:36.024
- We don't have anything to shock.
- We will.

37:36.191 --> 37:38.026
- Pacing pads.
- Good lung sounds.

37:38.360 --> 37:41.029
- Come on, Joey. Come on.
- V-tach.

37:41.446 --> 37:43.906
Yeah, baby, let's go. Clear.

37:46.533 --> 37:48.785
- Polymorphic.
- Okay, charge to 120.

37:48.951 --> 37:51.205
Check for a pulse. Clear.

37:52.997 --> 37:55.957
Bingo. Normal sinus.

37:56.125 --> 37:58.376
Thank you, God.

37:58.794 --> 38:00.629
Fem stick him for labs.

38:00.712 --> 38:04.089
Full trauma panel, ABG and an art line.

38:05.799 --> 38:08.886
Get a second cutdown.
Eighteen-gauge angiocath.

38:09.011 --> 38:11.804
- Anything after the line?
- Wait and see.

38:11.971 --> 38:15.391
-10 blade.
- Hey, it stopped raining.

38:16.517 --> 38:19.686
Impaction with mild or no displacement.
Probably a type 1.

38:19.854 --> 38:23.440
The fracture line traverses straight
from the greater to lesser trochanters.

38:23.607 --> 38:25.609
What do you think,
orthopedic surgery?

38:25.816 --> 38:28.819
Depends on the orthopod,
but I'd try to keep them away from her.

38:28.986 --> 38:33.031
One third of the elderly who go under
the knife for these kind of injuries...

38:33.199 --> 38:36.075
...die within a year
from post-op complications.

38:36.242 --> 38:38.703
She's panicking. Heart rate's up.
BP's falling.

38:38.870 --> 38:40.662
Get her out!

38:40.872 --> 38:42.248
- Gam?
- John.

38:42.414 --> 38:43.832
- John, are you there?
- I'm here.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.250
I want to go home.

38:45.417 --> 38:47.836
- Not quite yet.
- Call your grandfather to pick me up.

38:48.003 --> 38:49.922
I want to go home.

38:50.087 --> 38:52.423
- Grandpa's not here.
- Get him.

38:53.591 --> 38:55.801
Grandpa's dead.

38:58.262 --> 39:00.889
- Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.

39:01.056 --> 39:05.393
You were in a car accident.
Remember, Gam? You broke your hip?

39:05.601 --> 39:07.061
Oh, yes.

39:07.603 --> 39:09.229
Of course.

39:09.937 --> 39:15.026
I hit a dog. I hit a dog.
He was in the middle of the street.

39:47.678 --> 39:49.473
Is she okay?

39:49.638 --> 39:51.391
No.

39:51.891 --> 39:53.642
Not really.

39:56.019 --> 39:58.439
That baby okay?

39:58.605 --> 40:00.231
Yeah.

40:03.859 --> 40:07.988
Dr. Greene revived a drowned
hypothermic boy tonight.

40:08.113 --> 40:12.825
Came in ice-cold and not breathing,
no pulse, and he got him back.

40:14.285 --> 40:16.120
It was a miracle.

40:18.955 --> 40:20.999
You all right?

40:22.876 --> 40:24.669
What is it?

40:27.172 --> 40:30.507
- She's pregnant.
- Who?

40:31.132 --> 40:33.176
Nicole.

40:41.975 --> 40:43.811
I see.

40:43.977 --> 40:47.522
- Is that why she was stealing?
- No. That's a-

40:48.106 --> 40:52.609
That's a habit. She doesn't
know how to trust people.

40:52.776 --> 40:54.653
Trusting people
isn't really the problem.

40:54.819 --> 40:56.696
Her father kicked her out
when she was 16.

40:56.863 --> 40:59.199
She's had to learn to live on her own.

40:59.365 --> 41:00.783
Her father?

41:00.950 --> 41:04.995
She panicked, I guess. I don't know.

41:05.745 --> 41:11.710
I was just trying to help her.
I didn't think I'd be with her.

41:16.504 --> 41:18.464
It just happened.

41:21.384 --> 41:23.636
You sure it's yours?

41:24.637 --> 41:28.140
- And that she's really pregnant?
- She's not like that. You don't know her.

41:28.307 --> 41:30.600
Do you?

41:36.273 --> 41:39.692
We gave him what's called an EEG,
which is a brain scan.

41:39.859 --> 41:41.944
Everything looks completely normal.

41:42.110 --> 41:45.405
- So that's good?
- That's good.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.532
You're gonna get
your brother back, Daniel.

41:48.699 --> 41:52.578
- Thank you for saving him.
- You're welcome.

41:52.870 --> 41:54.371
Is my mom with him?

41:54.954 --> 41:57.374
Yeah.
They're gonna move him upstairs...

41:57.582 --> 42:00.209
...and you're gonna be up
in the same room soon.

42:02.627 --> 42:06.299
I'm gonna tell you something,
but you can't tell any other kids, okay?

42:06.464 --> 42:08.258
Okay.

42:09.467 --> 42:11.970
Parents don't always know
what they're doing.

42:12.136 --> 42:15.305
Just because they're adults
doesn't mean they know what's right.

42:16.597 --> 42:18.475
In fact...

42:18.641 --> 42:21.727
...some adults
are wrong most of the time.

42:23.146 --> 42:26.107
- I know that.
- Good.

42:28.108 --> 42:30.861
And I want you
to promise me something.

42:31.820 --> 42:33.822
What?

42:35.281 --> 42:37.950
Don't listen to them.

42:38.992 --> 42:43.871
Don't believe that you're not
just as good as your brother.

42:44.039 --> 42:45.915
Just as smart.

42:46.707 --> 42:49.085
Just as special.

42:53.422 --> 42:56.800
One day they may realize that...

42:58.093 --> 43:02.804
...but you can tell them it doesn't matter
because you already knew.

43:04.265 --> 43:06.433
You knew before they did.

43:15.482 --> 43:19.861
Dr. Weaver, Dr. Romano is looking for
you. The mother came out of surgery.

43:20.069 --> 43:22.989
They had to perform a hysterectomy,
but she's doing all right.

43:23.197 --> 43:25.616
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

43:25.865 --> 43:29.160
He also told me that I should try
to stay away from you...

43:29.327 --> 43:30.912
...if I'm gonna survive med school.

43:31.079 --> 43:33.497
Well, nobody actually listens
to Dr. Romano down here.

43:33.706 --> 43:35.874
Yeah, I figured that.

43:36.834 --> 43:39.336
It was pretty amazing
what you did out there.

43:39.670 --> 43:42.714
I was a little out of my element.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.674
Well, you wouldn't know it.

43:44.841 --> 43:46.592
Thank you.

43:47.176 --> 43:49.302
Why don't you go up
and take her baby to her?

43:49.511 --> 43:51.304
- They'd let me?
- It's one of the perks.

43:51.471 --> 43:54.390
- She's gonna think you're an angel.
- Yeah, well...

43:54.599 --> 43:57.267
- ... she did almost see me glowing.
- You did great.

43:57.435 --> 44:01.305
I mean, you took a risk,
stayed focused, listened.

44:01.492 --> 44:04.441
You did what was necessary.
That's an ER doc.

44:04.525 --> 44:06.067
I was scared out there for a while.

44:06.359 --> 44:09.820
- Gallant, I was scared the whole time.
- Right.

44:11.322 --> 44:14.158
The fireman is sitting well in ICU.
He's gonna keep his hands.

44:14.324 --> 44:18.578
- Cardiac activity is normal.
- Good. He got quite a jolt.

44:18.744 --> 44:20.413
We saved everybody, didn't we?

44:20.621 --> 44:23.332
Those people are all right now
because we were there.

44:23.499 --> 44:25.668
Some days are good days.

44:25.833 --> 44:27.503
Yeah, I like the good days.

44:28.461 --> 44:30.338
Enjoy them when they come.

44:30.505 --> 44:32.753
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.
