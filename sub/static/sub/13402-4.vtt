WEBVTT

00:02.930 --> 00:04.761
I told you
not to ask Mary for help.

00:04.770 --> 00:06.067
If I'd listened to you

00:06.070 --> 00:07.526
I wouldn't have seen
Mary and Elliot together.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.235
So you saw them arguing?
What's so suspicious about that?

00:09.240 --> 00:10.764
No, it was the way
that they argued.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.533
Like they were familiar
with each other.

00:12.540 --> 00:14.371
(Em/M
A/i cal/ed me begging for help.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.938
She is clearly scared
of someone in there.

00:15.950 --> 00:17.702
Ali's in trouble.
Maybe there's something

00:17.710 --> 00:18.904
in here that can help you find

00:18.910 --> 00:20.275
a connection between Mary
and Elliot.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.713
Caleb told me
about what happened

00:21.720 --> 00:23.278
between you two
at the Lost Woods.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.882
Spencer, I'm so sorry.

00:24.890 --> 00:26.414
I like everything about you.

00:26.420 --> 00:29.355
Yeah, but that's the problem.
You like me, butI love you.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.123
Elliott just sent me a text.

00:31.130 --> 00:32.984
It's a pin drop
of his location.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.594
Guys, I don't think this is
Elliott sending the text.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.749
I think Allison Is.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.628
Watch out!

00:39.640 --> 00:41.665
[all screaming]

00:41.670 --> 00:42.967
Oh, my God.

00:42.970 --> 00:44.767
[dramatic music]

00:49.080 --> 00:51.844
I don't know
if I can live with this.

00:51.850 --> 00:53.306
I mean, how can we bury..

00:54.880 --> 00:56.108
There has to be another way.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.588
There is no other way, Emily!

00:58.590 --> 01:00.785
It was a well thought-out plan
and when it ends up like this

01:00.790 --> 01:02.781
it's called first-degree murder.

01:04.030 --> 01:06.555
Look, Spencer is right.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.118
Just come on.

01:08.130 --> 01:10.325
[sobbing]

01:15.300 --> 01:17.359
What are we gonna do with them?

01:19.540 --> 01:22.100
(Aria)
'She's in shock.
It will wear off.‘

01:52.940 --> 01:54.202
Hanna”

01:55.380 --> 01:56.836
Maybe you should go wait
in the car with Alison.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.068
Seriously, we got it.
Just go sit in the car.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.344
No, I need to help.

02:01.350 --> 02:03.341
Okay, because if I don't
do something, then..

02:03.350 --> 02:05.545
Hanna, if you want to

02:05.550 --> 02:07.950
it's still not too late
to go to the police.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.279
We've been over this, Aria.

02:09.290 --> 02:11.326
I know and I still don't know

02:11.330 --> 02:13.286
why we can't tell them
exactly what happened.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.359
Elliott hurt Hanna,
abducted Ali and--

02:15.360 --> 02:16.998
...and the car didn't stop
in time.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.968
No one's gonna believe us
when we have every reason

02:18.970 --> 02:19.959
in the world
to have wanted him dead.

02:19.970 --> 02:20.959
We need to tell the truth.

02:20.970 --> 02:22.528
Yeah, what truth is that?

02:22.540 --> 02:24.758
The one where Hanna doesn't know
the right pedal from the left?

02:24.770 --> 02:27.102
Everyone just take
a breath. Okay?

02:27.110 --> 02:28.873
'Freaking out is not gonna help
any of us.'

02:28.880 --> 02:30.871
We have one choice here

02:30.880 --> 02:33.644
and it is to make it look like
Rollins skipped town.

02:33.650 --> 02:35.072
And why is anyone
gonna believe that?

02:35.080 --> 02:37.548
Because he was a dirtbag.

02:37.550 --> 02:39.643
Look, all we need to do
is cover our tracks.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.581
Yeah, is that all?

02:40.590 --> 02:41.818
We should be good at it by now.

02:41.820 --> 02:43.685
We've had a lot of practice.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.189
Look, if this is gonna work

02:49.200 --> 02:50.519
we've got to get her back
to Welby

02:50.530 --> 02:51.929
before anyone notices
she's missing.

02:51.930 --> 02:53.192
What if they already have?

02:53.200 --> 02:54.462
No, at night,
the nurses don't check

02:54.470 --> 02:55.892
the patients
unless they're called.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.138
They won't need a call.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.562
They'll hear us from a mile away

02:58.570 --> 02:59.832
with all the shattered glass
we're trailing.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.979
No, we have to leave
Lucas' car here.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.470
How do we even get to Welby?

03:03.480 --> 03:05.846
It's not like we can just knock
on the front door.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.702
You're gonna need this.

03:39.850 --> 03:42.512
Got a secret
Can you keep it?

03:42.520 --> 03:45.284
Swear this one you'll save

03:45.290 --> 03:47.440
Better lock it
in your pocket

03:47.460 --> 03:50.054
Taking this one to the grave

03:50.060 --> 03:55.225
If I show you then I know
you won't tell what I said

03:55.230 --> 03:57.619
'Cause two can keep a secret

03:57.630 --> 04:00.224
If one of them is dead

04:04.310 --> 04:05.868
There's nothing weird in here

04:05.870 --> 04:07.406
other than the fact that
there's nothing weird in here.

04:07.410 --> 04:09.002
No, that's not possible.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.035
As far as I can tell, the guy
never even used an emoji.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.699
Well, he probably
just deleted everything

04:12.720 --> 04:14.301
once he realized _
that we were on to hIm.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.538
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wipe it down first.

04:16.550 --> 04:18.142
You know, you always used
to make fun of me

04:18.150 --> 04:20.243
for carrying these around,
but now who's an uptight nerd?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.659
You, still you.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.480
So I-I'll just text you guys
when I'm inside?

04:23.490 --> 04:25.287
No, only after
you've already left

04:25.290 --> 04:26.723
'because if I get
to the train station too early'

04:26.730 --> 04:28.152
it will screw up
our whole timeline.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.696
- His timeline.
- Same thing.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.793
Yeah, and by the time the police
realize that he's missing

04:31.800 --> 04:33.267
and they start tracking
his phone

04:33.270 --> 04:35.295
'he'll be halfway
to Delaware.‘

04:35.300 --> 04:36.733
At least his jacket will be.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.232
God.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.309
Hanna, what's wrong?

04:40.310 --> 04:42.005
What do you mean what's wrong?

04:42.010 --> 04:43.307
I mean, what-what are we doing?

04:43.310 --> 04:44.504
We're never gonna
get away with this.

04:44.510 --> 04:45.545
Okay, don't say that.

04:45.550 --> 04:47.142
Who else is gonna say it, Emily?

04:47.150 --> 04:48.219
We've thought of everything.

04:48.220 --> 04:50.575
Nobody thinks of everything.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.444
Okay, I'm going to jail.

04:52.450 --> 04:54.111
I'm-I'm going to jail. I'm..

04:54.120 --> 04:56.850
I'm going to jail for, for..

04:56.860 --> 04:59.454
- Vehicular manslaughter?
- Yeah, vehicular manslaughter.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.291
'God, we're never gonna
be able pull this off.‘

05:01.300 --> 05:03.188
'I mean, there're way too many
things that could screw us up.'

05:03.200 --> 05:04.997
We've probably already done
50 things wrong by now.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.695
Hanna, please stop. Okay?

05:06.700 --> 05:08.361
You're not the only person
who buried a body back there.

05:08.370 --> 05:09.894
Guys, if we just stay calm

05:09.910 --> 05:12.060
and stick to the plan,
we'll be fine, okay?

05:12.070 --> 05:13.401
This is about containment

05:13.410 --> 05:15.275
and right now, everyone
who knows about Rollins

05:15.280 --> 05:17.032
'is sitting in this car.‘

05:32.230 --> 05:34.323
[cell phone vibrating]

05:59.250 --> 06:00.649
[sighs]

06:29.390 --> 06:30.914
(Emily)
'His car is a mess.‘

06:30.920 --> 06:32.740
It's gonna take you forever
to clean everything up.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.785
If you wanna help,
then stop pacing.

06:34.790 --> 06:37.418
You're tracking mud everywhere.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.829
Maybe I should give him a call.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.786
Tell him I'm gonna be late
for my shift.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.893
No, nothing can seem
out of the ordinary.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.767
'I'll meet you right after
I'm done here.‘

06:45.770 --> 06:46.862
Oh, my God.

06:46.870 --> 06:48.565
If Mr. Mizzari could see me
right now

06:48.570 --> 06:50.959
I totally would have gotten
the part of Lady Macbeth.

06:52.170 --> 06:54.468
How does it feel to be clean?

06:54.480 --> 06:56.539
I wouldn't know.

07:02.820 --> 07:04.139
Spencer, I could help you
with that.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.515
No, I got it.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.683
You're bleeding.

07:14.930 --> 07:16.454
It's not mine.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.161
Spence, can we please
just move forward?

07:25.970 --> 07:27.005
I swear I wasn't--

07:27.010 --> 07:28.170
[door opens]

07:30.750 --> 07:32.001
Spencer?

07:33.180 --> 07:34.647
'Spencer.'

07:35.850 --> 07:37.715
Spencer, I know you're in there.

07:39.220 --> 07:41.279
'If I have to break open
a window'

07:41.290 --> 07:43.155
'just to make sure you're okay,
I swear to God I--'

07:43.160 --> 07:44.980
No, no, I-I'm..

07:46.360 --> 07:47.918
I'm-I'm here.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.618
Can you let me in please?

07:52.630 --> 07:55.098
I can't really do this
right now.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.567
Well, I-I wanna talk to you.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.777
Come on, Spence,
this is stupid.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.645
Can-can I just
call you tomorrow?

08:05.650 --> 08:06.639
I'll call you
first thing in the morning--

08:06.650 --> 08:09.244
No, no. No, wait. Wait.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.049
Look, I'm an idiot, okay?

08:13.660 --> 08:16.220
Everything came out
wrong earlier.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.379
The..

08:17.390 --> 08:18.755
What happened with Hanna,
it was like

08:18.760 --> 08:20.853
this-this wound that I'd worked
so hard to heal--

08:20.860 --> 08:23.021
Okay, Caleb. I really
can't hear this right now.

08:23.030 --> 08:25.021
It was confusing,
but that's all it was.

08:25.030 --> 08:27.669
- It was a moment of_confusion--
- I'm begging you, just leave!

08:31.670 --> 08:34.878
Okay, re-re-remember
my first summer in D.C.?

08:36.110 --> 08:37.873
You and I just started
hanging out a lot

08:37.880 --> 08:40.644
and this one night
we met for a beer.

08:42.220 --> 08:45.678
Well, I-I had gotten a job offer
in San Francisco

08:45.690 --> 08:47.043
but we were having
such a good time

08:47.060 --> 08:49.358
that I decided to wait
to tell you I was moving

08:49.360 --> 08:51.180
until after our drink.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.252
'But then you noticed
that they were playing'

08:55.260 --> 08:57.296
"'Bringing Up Baby"
at the New Waverly.‘

08:58.600 --> 09:00.625
Do you remember?

09:02.840 --> 09:06.162
'Afterward, I walked you
to your apartment'

09:06.170 --> 09:08.001
'so I could tell you
about my job.‘

09:09.240 --> 09:11.128
But there was this violinist
playing on Kenyon

09:11.150 --> 09:14.142
so we sat in this stoop
for a minute to listen..

09:15.980 --> 09:18.073
...and I thought
why ruin the moment.

09:20.020 --> 09:21.487
'And when we finally got
to your door'

09:21.490 --> 09:23.856
'I started to tell you
about my job'

09:23.860 --> 09:26.249
'but you were distracted
looking for your keys.‘

09:27.730 --> 09:29.027
'I couldn't stop staring'

09:29.030 --> 09:31.055
'at that little_ cleft
In your chIn..'

09:32.400 --> 09:34.721
...thinking about how I wanted
to trace it with my finger..

09:35.600 --> 09:37.795
...and kiss you.

09:40.940 --> 09:42.578
'So I never told you
about the job'

09:42.580 --> 09:43.877
and I called them the next day

09:43.880 --> 09:46.075
and I told them
that I didn't want it.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.138
Do you remember that night?

09:58.990 --> 10:00.355
Yeah.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.951
Of course
I remember that night.

10:05.470 --> 10:07.620
That was one of the best.

10:11.910 --> 10:14.799
Can you please just open
the door so we can talk?

10:22.780 --> 10:24.816
Caleb, I really want to..

10:28.360 --> 10:30.351
...but I just need more time.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.084
Spence, maybe you should--

10:59.090 --> 11:00.887
Please don't.

11:06.260 --> 11:07.887
[beeping]

11:18.140 --> 11:19.459
Wait here, okay?

11:19.470 --> 11:21.438
Okay.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.032
Aria.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.200
What?

11:25.210 --> 11:26.541
Nothing, just..

11:26.550 --> 11:28.768
...just make sure you check
the admitting area too, okay.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.429
Alison.

11:51.610 --> 11:54.170
Can I have some more olives
before you punch out?

11:55.780 --> 11:58.772
As soon as we get
Aria's text, you..

11:58.780 --> 12:00.975
I drive Rollins' car
to the train station

12:00.980 --> 12:02.516
I use his credit card
to purchase

12:02.520 --> 12:05.045
an 11:57 one way, East Bound.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.939
As soon as the train pulls up
to the station, I will step on.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.450
I'll leave his jacket
with his cellphone in the pocket

12:09.460 --> 12:10.984
of a seat, I step off.

12:10.990 --> 12:12.526
Right, and while
you're doing that

12:12.530 --> 12:13.883
I'll be at Al_ison's house
packing up

12:13.900 --> 12:15.219
Rollins' stuff
into an overnight bag

12:15.230 --> 12:17.425
making it look like
he left in a hurry.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.161
What is taking Aria so long?

12:21.170 --> 12:22.797
She should have been done
by now.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.438
[cell phone chimes]

12:27.040 --> 12:30.498
It's Hanna, wondering
if we should call Aria.

12:30.510 --> 12:32.398
Just tell Hanna to hang tight.

12:35.020 --> 12:38.581
Look. I know things are a
little rocky with you and Caleb

12:38.590 --> 12:40.012
but you can't blame Hanna.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.159
She kissed him, Em..

12:42.160 --> 12:43.809
...recently.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.129
[sighs]

12:48.500 --> 12:50.491
I'm sorry. I-I didn't know that.

12:53.570 --> 12:55.595
Just remember, being back here

12:55.600 --> 12:57.739
_ we've all fallen
Into old patterns.

12:57.740 --> 12:59.935
'Okay? This entire night
is proof of that.'

12:59.940 --> 13:01.805
I get it. Okay?

13:01.810 --> 13:04.005
I know it's not always easy
with an ex.

13:04.010 --> 13:07.241
I mean...when I saw
Yvonne's ring, I just..

13:10.550 --> 13:12.188
You know, even if you're happy
for the person

13:12.190 --> 13:14.818
there's just this,
like, dull ache.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.257
But I gave Hanna years
to figure out

13:17.260 --> 13:18.625
if she wanted him back or not.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.757
Maybe it has nothing
to do with Hanna.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.399
Okay. Maybe the timing
was...off.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.265
I don't understand
when people say that.

13:25.270 --> 13:26.498
What is timing?

13:26.500 --> 13:29.298
Timing is for figure skaters
and comedians.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.359
You either love someone
or you don't.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.798
Are you coming?

13:33.810 --> 13:35.038
No.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.746
Might as well strengthen
my alibi being the sad girl

13:38.750 --> 13:40.149
at the end of the bar.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.141
Okay, well, I don't know
what to say.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.539
So, uh, good luck.
Break a leg.

13:44.550 --> 13:47.189
How about...knock 'em dead?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.059

[glass shatters]

14:41.740 --> 14:43.378
Alison?

14:46.580 --> 14:49.242
I thought I could go back
in there, but I can't.

14:53.490 --> 14:55.287
I know this is difficult..

14:56.730 --> 14:59.324
_ ...but no one
IS gonna hurt you here.

14:59.330 --> 15:00.354
Rollins is gone.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.396
If you don't go back up there..

15:06.070 --> 15:07.992
It's not just you and me.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.059
Everyone is counting on us.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.271
You promise
you'll come back for me.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.939
I promise.

15:22.050 --> 15:24.541
[pop song on speaker]

15:38.170 --> 15:40.525
Oh, sorry, I didn't order this.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.565
I know. He did.

15:50.410 --> 15:51.946
Okay.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.881
What are you doing?

16:02.890 --> 16:03.914
I thought we were--

16:03.930 --> 16:05.454
If you leave me in these

16:05.460 --> 16:06.484
I'll be trapped.

16:06.490 --> 16:07.627
I know.

16:07.630 --> 16:10.053
But the nurses have to see
what he did to you.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.391
They have to see
that he was a monster.

16:17.740 --> 16:19.605
[exhales]

16:19.610 --> 16:23.102
I married that monster.
How stupid am I?

16:25.250 --> 16:27.138
You're not stupid.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.373
You were in love.

16:30.420 --> 16:33.218
And he was in love
with Charlotte.

16:33.220 --> 16:35.688
That's what the girl
at the farm said, right?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.182
Yeah.

16:39.190 --> 16:43.422
But she also carried around
a doll with no face.

16:43.430 --> 16:45.125
After all those years
that I fought for her

16:45.130 --> 16:47.121
to be released.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.165
How could he think
that I killed her?

16:55.380 --> 16:57.109
Did you?

16:58.050 --> 16:59.278
Did you kill her?

17:01.220 --> 17:02.619
I have to ask because..

17:03.820 --> 17:05.811
...Ezra and I thought
we saw you that night

17:05.820 --> 17:07.344
going into the church.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.954
[sighs]

17:09.960 --> 17:11.518
Why do I still think that a lie

17:11.530 --> 17:14.226
will sound better
than the truth?

17:14.230 --> 17:16.755
'I told Charlotte about
Elliott and me that night.‘

17:18.430 --> 17:21.422
We argued. She stormed out.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.228
I followed her to the church,
but I swear I didn't kill her.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.832
I told you not to follow me.

17:26.840 --> 17:29.070
You can't just wander around
in the middle of the night.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.401
The terms of your release
were very clear.

17:31.410 --> 17:32.809
What do you care
what happens to me?

17:32.810 --> 17:34.346
You hooked up with my doctor.

17:34.350 --> 17:35.647
That is not what happened.

17:35.650 --> 17:37.447
Please, can we just talk
about this at home?

17:37.450 --> 17:39.281
No, all those times
you came to the hospital

17:39.290 --> 17:40.780
I thought you were there
to see me.

17:40.790 --> 17:41.882
I was.

17:41.890 --> 17:43.209
We both cared about you.

17:43.220 --> 17:44.482
That's what made
Elliott and me close.

17:44.490 --> 17:46.549
He didn't do it on purpose.
There's just..

17:46.560 --> 17:48.790
There's a point where we
couldn't deny our connection.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.722
I don't wanna hear any of this.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.061
Just go.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.560
Please, just leave me alone.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.693
Why didn't you tell
the police what you saw?

18:28.740 --> 18:30.867
I was scared_
that they wouldn't believe me.

18:32.270 --> 18:34.500
That they'd think
that I killed her.

18:36.010 --> 18:37.830
Why wouldn't they? You did.

18:41.950 --> 18:44.748
The hardest part is knowing
that if I hadn't left her

18:44.750 --> 18:46.615
she would still be alive.

18:47.290 --> 18:49.485
Or you might not be.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.598
[cell phone vibrates]

19:02.840 --> 19:04.535
I have to go.

19:04.540 --> 19:06.838
I'll be back as soon as I can.

19:06.840 --> 19:09.729
You're forgetting something.
In the drawer.

19:18.020 --> 19:19.840
You said that..

19:19.850 --> 19:22.455
...you want them to see
what kind of person he was.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.919
Are you sure?

19:35.200 --> 19:36.838
Yeah.

19:38.670 --> 19:40.467
Put it on.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.908
[dramatic music]

20:03.930 --> 20:05.591
Hi, I'm Marco.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.192
Ah, I'm leaving.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.134
Well, that's a very
unusual name.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.768
Sorry, I don't mean
to be rude. I just..

20:11.770 --> 20:13.032
Thank you for the drink.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.031
I just should really
get going soon.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.530
Okay.

20:16.540 --> 20:21.239
Well, soon is soon.
Not same as now, is it?

20:26.720 --> 20:28.881
Um, yeah.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.809
Guess I could stay
for a minute.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.786
Good.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.995
Some extra olives
for the lady please.

20:37.430 --> 20:39.466
What? I pay attention.

20:41.770 --> 20:43.294
So, um..

20:43.300 --> 20:45.359
- Spencer.
- Spencer.

20:46.410 --> 20:48.401
What were you doing tonight?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.304
Burying a body.

20:53.850 --> 20:55.841
[laughing]

20:59.820 --> 21:01.549
(Hanna)
Maybe she's making it up.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.118
I mean, it is Alison
we're talking about.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.452
No, I'm telling you, I don't
think Alison had anything

21:05.460 --> 21:07.223
to do with Charlotte
getting killed.

21:07.230 --> 21:09.494
Well, we've been wrong before.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.524
Are you sure we have everything?

21:10.530 --> 21:12.054
Yeah, accelerant, lighters

21:12.070 --> 21:13.423
gloves, goggles.

21:13.430 --> 21:14.920
I think she's telling the truth.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.261
Besides, this isn't
the same Alison we knew at 15.

21:17.270 --> 21:19.101
Yeah, well, I didn't think
I was the same person either

21:19.110 --> 21:20.429
but look where we are.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.067
Oh, God, I used to be
so scared of her.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.775
This one time,
she and I wore the same shirt

21:23.780 --> 21:25.805
and I told the school nurse
I was feeling flu-ish

21:25.810 --> 21:27.402
just so I could go home
and change.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.547
Now, All is the one
who's scared.

21:29.550 --> 21:31.643
She was practically shaking
at the hospital

21:31.650 --> 21:33.481
I-I couldn't even look her
in the eyes.

21:33.490 --> 21:35.583
I felt too guilty.

21:35.590 --> 21:37.888
Hanna, she can never know
that we were the ones--

21:37.890 --> 21:39.926
- Aria?
- Yeah.

21:39.930 --> 21:42.023
We're missing something.

21:42.030 --> 21:44.021
- What?
- The car.

21:44.030 --> 21:46.669
[dramatic music]

21:52.270 --> 21:54.158
[laughing]

21:54.180 --> 21:57.001
No. No, come on,
that's an urban legend.

21:57.010 --> 21:58.830
No way. It happened
to my college girlfriend.

21:58.850 --> 22:01.546
What? Oh, my God.
What did she do?

22:01.550 --> 22:02.915
Well, she couldn't tell him
what it was now

22:02.920 --> 22:04.171
or he'd feel stupid

22:04.190 --> 22:05.919
so she picked
the piece up and ate it.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.639
No. No way.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.049
Lynn was.. She was
a nice southern girl, you know?

22:11.060 --> 22:13.324
Like, Emily Post was like
a God to her.

22:13.330 --> 22:15.184
She even graduated
from charm school.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.758
Charm school?
That's like a thing?

22:16.760 --> 22:18.625
Yeah. Well, they don't
call it that anymore.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.064
I think it's called
"finishing school."

22:21.070 --> 22:23.061
[laughing]

22:24.610 --> 22:26.498
Uh..

22:26.510 --> 22:29.729
...well, I think
I'm pretty finished, so..

22:29.740 --> 22:33.506
- Yeah?
- Check please. Thanks.

22:33.510 --> 22:35.375
- No, no, no. I got this.
- Come on. No, no, no.

22:35.380 --> 22:37.177
This one's on me.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.442
I may not have gone
to charm school

22:39.450 --> 22:43.159
but wouldn't want you
to get the wrong idea.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.048
What kind of wrong idea?

22:56.170 --> 22:59.833
To hear the boom boom boom
of your heart

23:00.780 --> 23:04.102
The danger is
I'm dangerous

23:04.110 --> 23:07.568
And I might
just tear you apart

23:08.920 --> 23:12.276
Oh oh oh oh

23:12.290 --> 23:16.989
I'm gonna catch ya
I'm gonna get ya get ya

Oh oh oh

23:19.160 --> 23:24.325
I wanna taste the way
that you bleed oh..

23:24.330 --> 23:25.763
Stop. Stop, stop.

23:27.170 --> 23:28.819
What happened?

23:28.840 --> 23:30.330
I'm sorry.

23:30.340 --> 23:32.535
I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.071
It's okay.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.775
'It's okay.‘

23:47.960 --> 23:49.587
(Hanna)
'Tell me this is a nightmare.‘

23:49.590 --> 23:51.649
- It's gone.
- No, it-it can't be gone.

23:51.660 --> 23:52.729
We must just be
in the wrong place.

23:52.730 --> 23:54.322
No, I remember covering it up

23:54.330 --> 23:55.479
and putting it by the tree.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.922
The tree? Hanna,
look around you.

23:56.930 --> 23:58.329
It's all trees.
We're in a forest.

23:58.330 --> 23:59.695
No, I put it by this tree

23:59.700 --> 24:01.520
because it looked like
one of those trees

24:01.540 --> 24:03.337
that those-those
little men would live in.

24:03.340 --> 24:04.762
Hanna, just think, alright?

24:04.770 --> 24:06.306
Are-are you sure that
we came in from this direction?

24:06.310 --> 24:08.232
You know, those little men
with, like, the ears and..

24:08.240 --> 24:09.502
We'll be okay. We just..

24:09.510 --> 24:11.137
We need to retrace
our steps, okay?

24:11.150 --> 24:12.947
Keebler Elves.

24:14.180 --> 24:15.875
Oh, my God.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.745
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

24:17.750 --> 24:20.844
It's gotta be here. We just
hid it really, really well.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.909
We lost the car.
We lost the damn car, Aria.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.649
Hanna, cars don't just up
and drive themselves.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.822
You're right.

24:32.470 --> 24:33.994
Somebody else drove it.

24:48.450 --> 24:50.816
[cell phone ringing]

24:52.850 --> 24:55.739
Hey, I just left Alison's house
with Elliott's bag.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.409
Do we wanna burn it _
or do we wanna throw It

24:57.430 --> 24:59.182

25:05.700 --> 25:07.964
'I can't, I can't even drive.‘

25:11.240 --> 25:12.502
Where are you?

25:13.770 --> 25:15.237
(Aria)
'What are we supposed
to do now?‘

25:15.240 --> 25:16.673
(Hanna)
Call Emily and Spencer.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.102
We have to pull the plug
on this whole plan.

25:18.110 --> 25:19.577
Wait, really? Are you sure?

25:19.580 --> 25:21.502
Well, when someone steals the
car that you're about to torch

25:21.520 --> 25:23.044
your cover-up
is kind of uncovered.

25:23.050 --> 25:24.074
[car approaching]

25:26.420 --> 25:27.648
(Aria)
'It's the car.'

25:28.920 --> 25:30.581
No way.

25:33.330 --> 25:34.683
[dramatic music]

25:35.930 --> 25:39.127
Well, you two sure know
how to ruin a surprise.

25:45.910 --> 25:47.229
So how long have you
been following us?

25:47.240 --> 25:49.936
I wasn't following you...
specifically.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.532
After Hanna was targeted by "A."

25:51.550 --> 25:54.303
- A.D.
- "Uber A," whatever.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.049
I started paying attention.

25:56.050 --> 25:58.814
So when I heard All had gone
full-blown "Girl Interrupted"

25:58.820 --> 26:00.048
I got suspicious--

26:00.050 --> 26:01.244
Of Rollins?

26:01.260 --> 26:03.478
I started trailing him
as a precaution.

26:03.490 --> 26:05.151
I put a GPS tracker on his car

26:05.160 --> 26:06.821
so when I saw it drive to
the middle of the woods tonight

26:06.830 --> 26:09.651
I decided to check it out.
Call it curiosity.

26:09.660 --> 26:11.753
You know what that did
to the cat, right?

26:13.200 --> 26:15.168
How did you find Lucas' car?

26:15.170 --> 26:16.296
It wasn't that hard.

26:16.300 --> 26:17.938
You didn't exactly do
a cracker-jack job

26:17.940 --> 26:19.669
of erasing the tire tracks.

26:19.670 --> 26:21.331
And the bloody windshield
told me the rest.

26:21.340 --> 26:23.228
So do you make it a habit
of inserting yourself

26:23.240 --> 26:25.834
into other people's homicides
or just ours?

26:25.850 --> 26:27.442
Torching the car would have
been a bonehead move.

26:27.450 --> 26:30.146
Why? It would've gotten rid
of blood and fingerprints.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.345
An abandoned car,
scorched in the middle of woods

26:32.350 --> 26:33.817
tends to raise some eyebrows.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.788
Okay. Where did you get
the windshield fixed?

26:35.790 --> 26:36.984
At a place
that won't ask questions

26:36.990 --> 26:38.651
and doesn't give answers.

26:38.660 --> 26:41.254
More importantly, what'd you do
with Rollins' burner phone?

26:43.800 --> 26:45.290
What burner phone?

26:53.010 --> 26:54.261
Sit down here.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.001
Thanks.

26:57.010 --> 27:00.309
His, uh, keys, did you remember
to do something with them?

27:00.310 --> 27:02.301
I tossed them in the gutter.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.539
And, and our fingerprints?
It's on the handles.

27:05.550 --> 27:06.949
- Did you--
- Took care of it?

27:06.950 --> 27:08.713
Okay. What about the--

27:08.720 --> 27:10.950
How could do this to yourself?

27:10.960 --> 27:12.780
How could you do this to us?

27:12.790 --> 27:14.155
This could have
ruined everything.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.024
I know.

27:15.030 --> 27:16.554
Why would you go
and lose control

27:16.560 --> 27:18.790
on the one night
when you needed it the most?

27:20.200 --> 27:21.394
[panting]

27:26.410 --> 27:27.934
You know, there..

27:27.940 --> 27:31.273
...there were a few years
where I really felt free.

27:33.910 --> 27:35.673
I-I didn't flinch anymore

27:35.680 --> 27:37.272
when I saw somebody
wearing a hoodie

27:37.280 --> 27:40.408
or when I got a blocked call
on my phone. I..

27:41.960 --> 27:45.953
I thought it's over,
just really over, like for real.

27:49.560 --> 27:52.028
I took horseback riding lessons.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.122
I took a cooking class.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.333
I even let friends
tag me in photos.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.105
And now, we're just..

28:05.110 --> 28:07.044
...we're right back
where we started.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.878
It's worse. Now I have
aiding and abetting

28:10.890 --> 28:13.142
and a failed relationship
to add to the math.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.952
Here, drink.

28:34.510 --> 28:36.171
[sighs]

28:37.780 --> 28:39.771
I'm sorry.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.177
I'm sorry I screwed up so badly.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.885
Don't worry about it.

28:47.660 --> 28:48.888
It's over.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.648
If it makes you feel any better

28:54.660 --> 28:56.389
we're all there with you.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.422
Right back at the beginning.

29:00.770 --> 29:02.499
It doesn't make me feel
any better.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.259
Drink more.

29:05.270 --> 29:08.307
No, seriously,
if I drink anything else

29:08.310 --> 29:09.834
I'm gonna be sick.

29:21.190 --> 29:22.282
[sighs]

29:26.130 --> 29:29.759
(Aria)
I know we need a cover,
but maybe brunch was a bad idea.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.057
What if your mom sees us?

29:31.070 --> 29:32.992
No, she's in New York
this weekend.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.262
(Spencer)
'Besides, even if she wasn't'

29:34.270 --> 29:35.999
all we're doing is
eating bagels.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.298
And talking about burner phones.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.766
How do we even know
a burner phone eXIsts?

29:39.770 --> 29:40.862
Because I've heard him on it.

29:40.880 --> 29:41.938
It's the only time he drops

29:41.940 --> 29:43.999
that phony American accent.

29:46.550 --> 29:48.438
Does this record sound?

29:48.450 --> 29:49.474
No, just visuals.

29:50.680 --> 29:51.840
What if we can't find
the phone?

29:51.850 --> 29:53.283
We have to.

29:53.290 --> 29:54.746
I've never heard the other end
of his calls.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.352
We don't know
who he's working with.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.214
Guys, I'm sorry. I may be
a little bit slow this morning

29:58.230 --> 29:59.527
but yes, we do.

29:59.530 --> 30:01.259
Is there anyone here who thinks
that it's not Mary Drake?

30:01.260 --> 30:03.797
I'm sorry but are we comfortable
with those visuals?

30:03.800 --> 30:05.199
Us together on tape?

30:05.200 --> 30:06.497
Look, after dealing with "A"

30:06.500 --> 30:07.899
the only thing we know
for sure is that

30:07.900 --> 30:09.561
we can never_ be sure
of anything.

30:09.570 --> 30:10.730
I just think that we should--

30:10.740 --> 30:13.061
Aria, stop.
Drink your mimosa.

30:14.810 --> 30:16.437
How do we get the phone?

30:16.440 --> 30:17.577
I can try to ping it.

30:17.580 --> 30:18.774
See where it was used last.

30:18.780 --> 30:20.475
If we're lucky,
it might still be there.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.243
Okay, so bottom line,
we find the phone

30:22.250 --> 30:23.911
we find Elliott's accomplice.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.070
Guys, it's Mary Drake,
seriously.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.978
Who else could it possibly be?

30:28.860 --> 30:31.283
[footsteps approaching]

30:52.750 --> 30:55.310
- Holy--
- Shh.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.953
Hanna? Hanna Marin?

31:03.960 --> 31:05.484
Yeah, Jenna, it's me.

31:06.330 --> 31:08.184
I thought I heard your voice.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.158
I could've sworn
I heard Aria too.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.493
- Hi, Jenna.
- Oh, my God.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.865
What are the chances?

31:16.870 --> 31:18.861
We're as surprised as you are.

31:18.870 --> 31:20.633
Mona.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.369
Don't tell me you're all here.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.029
I knew it would be strange
coming back

31:24.040 --> 31:26.133
but I didn't think
I'd be taking a time machine.

31:26.150 --> 31:27.708
They make those
in a four-door now?

31:27.720 --> 31:29.278
[Jenna scoffs]

31:29.280 --> 31:32.443
I see you haven't lost
your sense of humor, Spencer.

31:33.490 --> 31:35.048
So what brings you back?

31:35.060 --> 31:36.379
Toby's engagement.

31:36.390 --> 31:38.813
A lot of our family
came back to celebrate.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.559
But you're staying
at the Radley?

31:40.560 --> 31:43.154
Oh, didn't you hear?
My house blew up.

31:44.430 --> 31:45.920
'I heard that Toby's
not the only one'

31:45.930 --> 31:47.158
'with wedding bells
in his future.‘

31:47.170 --> 31:49.320
So congratulations, Hanna.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.503
Thank you.

31:53.510 --> 31:56.070
Um, how-how did you..

31:56.080 --> 31:57.570
Through the grapevine.

32:00.450 --> 32:03.977
Well, unfortunately,
I have to get going.

32:03.980 --> 32:06.642
Tell Ali I hope
she feels better.

32:06.650 --> 32:08.811
Or maybe I'll go visit her.

32:08.820 --> 32:11.880
Return the favor
from so long ago.

32:11.890 --> 32:14.085
After running into
all of you, I..

32:15.360 --> 32:17.624
...I can't help
but feel all nostalgic.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.350
Bye.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.666
[tapping]

32:25.370 --> 32:27.861
So the day
after we run someone over

32:27.880 --> 32:29.336
she comes tapping through town.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.228
- It's a co-incidence.
- 'There's no such thing.'

32:31.250 --> 32:33.502
Co-incidences are the devil's
way of remaining anonymous.

32:33.510 --> 32:36.001
I know it might be a little
uncomfortable seeing her

32:36.020 --> 32:38.079
'but she could just
be here for Toby.‘

32:38.090 --> 32:39.944
'I know Yvonne's family
is in town.‘

32:43.360 --> 32:45.555
I'll go get some more
orange juice.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.592
Hey.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.261
Hey.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.131
Are you gonna stay mad
at me forever?

33:06.880 --> 33:08.438
No.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.179
But I do need to be mad at you
for just like a bit longer

33:14.190 --> 33:17.614
so if you wanna be
a good friend, then..

33:17.620 --> 33:18.655
...just let me..

33:19.960 --> 33:21.257
...let me be mad at you.

33:23.030 --> 33:25.123
Okay.

33:28.970 --> 33:32.758
You should go see him.
Let us find the burner phone.

33:34.310 --> 33:36.904
But what am I supposed to say
when he asks about last night?

33:36.910 --> 33:38.571
Tell him the truth.

33:41.750 --> 33:43.069
What about..

33:43.080 --> 33:45.469
Maybe they'll be mad
for a little while

33:45.490 --> 33:48.186
but...there are worse things.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.413
Go.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.209
Jenna.

34:12.210 --> 34:13.802
What are you doing here?

34:17.080 --> 34:18.570
I came to say hello.

34:18.590 --> 34:21.741
No, I mean what are you doing
here in Rosewood?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.250
I came to say hello.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.216
I hear you're engaged.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.754
Does my dad know
that you're here?

34:29.100 --> 34:30.499
No, not yet.

34:30.500 --> 34:33.389
But you know I like to
think of him as my dad too.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.960
Right, yeah, we're all
one big happy family. I forgot.

34:35.970 --> 34:38.234
I figured that now you're
starting a family of your own

34:38.240 --> 34:41.664
that...it would be a good time
to make amends.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.669
Yeah?

34:42.680 --> 34:44.136
I seem to remember
we tried that

34:44.140 --> 34:45.175
about three years ago

34:45.180 --> 34:47.171
and it didn't go so well.

34:48.550 --> 34:50.541
Yeah, maybe not.

34:50.550 --> 34:54.179
But] would
really
like _
to try again.

34:58.860 --> 35:00.589
I can't do it.

35:00.590 --> 35:02.148
- What do you mean?
- It's not possible.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.025
I can hack into each
cell tower's database

35:04.030 --> 35:05.190
but unless I know the number,
I can't--

35:05.200 --> 35:06.827
You don't have to explain.

35:06.830 --> 35:08.525
I won't understand anyway.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.300
I'm sorry.
I really wanted to help you.

35:15.310 --> 35:17.107
No, you have.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.704
A lot.

35:19.810 --> 35:22.142
These last couple of days
have been..

35:26.090 --> 35:28.183
Spencer was right.

35:29.390 --> 35:31.085
There was time to stop

35:31.090 --> 35:32.853
if I hadn't gotten
the pedals mixed up.

35:32.860 --> 35:34.384
No, look.

35:34.390 --> 35:37.325
You got confused.
It could happen to anyone.

35:37.330 --> 35:39.753
I keep telling myself
that it was an accident.

35:41.470 --> 35:44.337
A horrible accident but..

35:46.470 --> 35:48.529
...when I saw Rollins..

35:49.980 --> 35:51.299
...I just..

35:52.480 --> 35:56.302
...I remember being
in a cold, dark room.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.745
So was I confused or..

36:02.320 --> 36:04.857
was I the least confused
I've ever been in my life?

36:06.460 --> 36:07.586
[sniffs]

36:13.170 --> 36:15.422
Is that part
of the confusion too?

36:17.440 --> 36:18.498
What do you mean?

36:18.510 --> 36:21.070
Han, we used to spend weekends

36:21.070 --> 36:22.298
browsing the Tiffany's catalog.

36:22.310 --> 36:23.834
You think I don't know
a fake diamond

36:23.840 --> 36:25.478
when I see one?

36:29.850 --> 36:30.874
[sighs]

36:30.880 --> 36:32.768
Jordan and I broke up.

36:33.820 --> 36:36.914
But I'm not...telling
anyone yet.

36:38.590 --> 36:40.626
Spencer and Caleb
are going through some stuff.

36:40.630 --> 36:43.326
And you don't wanna be
a factor.

36:45.030 --> 36:47.362
[sighs]
That's noble..

36:47.370 --> 36:48.894
...but you can't hide
this forever.

36:48.900 --> 36:51.937
'At some point, people
are gonna expect, you know..'

36:51.940 --> 36:53.805
...a wedding.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.007
Oh, my God, my bracelet.

36:57.010 --> 37:00.104
I-I had a gold chain bracelet
on, and now it's not here.

37:00.110 --> 37:01.509
Well, when did you have it
on last?

37:01.520 --> 37:03.613
Last night in Rollins' car.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.311
You're joking, right?

37:07.320 --> 37:09.413
Oh, God, why?
Why is this happening?

37:09.420 --> 37:10.956
If they find my bracelet
in Rollins' car--

37:10.960 --> 37:12.916
They're not going to.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.395
This is a lost cause.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.890
They're never gonna let us in
to see her.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.733
Probably not, just as long as
they told her that we came.

37:24.740 --> 37:27.504
We don't want Alison to think
that we're abandoning her.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.433
He's only been missing
a few hours.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.600
'Why is the Rosewood PD
suddenly so motivated?‘

37:34.620 --> 37:36.076
(Emily)
Because of me.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.446
I asked Toby to look
into Rollins, remember?

37:38.450 --> 37:40.145
Great, you just sent
the police

37:40.150 --> 37:41.742
on a manhunt for the guy
we just murdered.

37:41.760 --> 37:42.715
[clears throat]

37:42.720 --> 37:44.756
Hey. You both
better come with me.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.921
- Toby, what is going on?
- Now.

37:53.970 --> 37:55.323
Caleb?

37:58.770 --> 37:59.930
Caleb?

38:25.330 --> 38:27.366
[door opens]

38:34.610 --> 38:36.498
[gasps]
What are you doing here?

38:37.840 --> 38:41.276
No need to call
for the nurse, dear.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.316
I'm in charge now.

38:46.750 --> 38:49.480
Okay, enough
with the secrecy already.

38:49.490 --> 38:50.809
What's going on?

38:51.590 --> 38:53.057
We should wait for Hanna.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.221
Uh, she can't come.
She had plans with her mom.

38:55.230 --> 38:57.698
Toby...what is it?

38:59.400 --> 39:01.265
I studied the file you gave me

39:01.270 --> 39:02.669
but I couldn't find a connection

39:02.670 --> 39:05.332
between Mary Drake
and Elliott Rollins.

39:05.340 --> 39:07.706
Okay. So why were cops
all over Welby?

39:10.010 --> 39:12.001
Elliott Rollins is dead.

39:17.580 --> 39:19.741
He's been dead for 15 years.

39:19.750 --> 39:20.944
Wait, what?

39:20.950 --> 39:23.214
When I ran Elliott Rollins' name
through our database

39:23.220 --> 39:26.109
there were inconsistencies,
so I looked into it.

39:26.130 --> 39:30.089
The real Dr. Elliott Rollins
was 72 years old

39:30.100 --> 39:31.522
when he died of a stroke.

39:33.530 --> 39:35.964
So the guy Alison married is..

39:35.970 --> 39:37.562
A fraud.

39:37.570 --> 39:40.630
He's been using the identity
of the deceased Dr. Rollins

39:40.640 --> 39:42.062
'the whole time
he's been working here.‘

39:42.080 --> 39:43.877
And he must have realized
that he was close

39:43.880 --> 39:46.804
to being found out too
because he's missing.

39:46.810 --> 39:48.300
'He didn't show up
for work today.‘

39:48.320 --> 39:49.969
'He's not answering his phone.‘

39:49.980 --> 39:51.675
He's gone.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.112
D-do you know where he is?

39:53.120 --> 39:55.645
Not yet but we will find him.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.116
'I already spoke
to my captain.‘

39:57.120 --> 39:58.815
He's making it top priority.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.849
Good.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.122
Look, I-I should probably go.

40:06.130 --> 40:09.896
Um, but...in the meantime

40:09.900 --> 40:12.596
please keep all of this
to yourselves. Okay?

40:13.440 --> 40:15.362
We won't say a word.

40:15.380 --> 40:16.779
Just, please be careful

40:16.780 --> 40:18.771
I don't know
what this guy is capable of.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.616
I promise you guys won't
have to stay quiet for long.

40:23.620 --> 40:25.679
The truth will come out.

40:29.390 --> 40:30.584
[door closes]

40:30.590 --> 40:32.683
[announcement on speaker]

40:35.430 --> 40:38.092
[train horn blaring]

40:39.730 --> 40:42.460
Whose genius idea was it
to throw away the key?

40:44.670 --> 40:46.137
We should have told him.

40:46.140 --> 40:48.005
We should have told him
exactly what happened.

40:48.010 --> 40:48.829
Are you nuts?

40:48.840 --> 40:50.728
Guys, if Rollins isn't Rollins

40:50.740 --> 40:52.537
then who the hell
did we just kill?

40:53.850 --> 40:55.249
All I found is a candy wrapper
and a clump of hair.

40:55.250 --> 40:56.569
Are you sure it's in here?

40:56.580 --> 40:57.774
Hey, hand me that lock thingy,
will you?

40:57.780 --> 40:59.179
Okay, but, Hanna,
we have to go

40:59.190 --> 41:00.441
'because if a train comes
before we leave--'

41:00.450 --> 41:01.712
Just one minute.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.151
In two minutes, commuters are
gonna flood this parking lot

41:05.160 --> 41:06.650
'and see you stabbing
at a seat cushion'

41:06.660 --> 41:08.184
'with a metal hook.‘

41:11.060 --> 41:12.618
Got it.

41:16.770 --> 41:18.863
[cell phone ringing]

41:25.080 --> 41:27.571
[ringing continues]

41:32.050 --> 41:35.178
(woman on phone)
'Hi, Archer, can you hear me?‘

41:36.120 --> 41:37.678
TtsJennaJ

41:37.690 --> 41:39.658
'Jenna Marshall.‘

41:47.970 --> 41:50.962
