00:51.552 --> 00:52.553
Hi.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.471
There you go.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.473
If you don't mind.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.020
-Thanks.
-Sure.

01:02.104 --> 01:07.067
So I was like, "Okay. Hi. Hello.
You literally can't treat me this way."

01:08.235 --> 01:12.573
Yeah. Yeah, no. Exactly.
I'm like, "We're both grown-ass adults,

01:12.656 --> 01:15.075
but one of us is acting
like a complete child."

01:15.158 --> 01:17.369
It's not my fault
she fucking hates her own life.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.956
She needs to own her own shit
and not take it out on me. Yeah.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.792
I ordered the salad without onions.
It should come without onions.

01:23.876 --> 01:26.545
That is something
that needs to be happening right now.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.839
-I know.
-Here you go.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.342
And I really didn't need this interaction
today of all days, you know?

01:32.426 --> 01:33.427
You have a--

01:37.764 --> 01:39.266
Motherfucker.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.029
-Oh, my God, Victor.
-Oh.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.115
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

01:55.782 --> 01:58.160
I have my hands full. You can set it down.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.246
Oh, yeah. Go ahead. I'll take care of it.
No worries.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.458
Going to the Dodgers game this weekend?

02:04.541 --> 02:05.834
You know, I had tickets,

02:05.918 --> 02:07.794
-but I gave 'em away.
-What? You did?

02:07.878 --> 02:10.172
Yeah. My daughter wasn't that into it
last time we went.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.300
She always used to be, but not anymore,
I guess, so... We'll do something else.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.969
-It's totally fine. Yeah.
-How old's your daughter?

02:16.053 --> 02:18.472
-Thirteen.
-Teenage years are hard.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.975
-Does it get better?
-I wouldn't know.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.103
My daughter lives with her father,
her brother lives with me,

02:25.187 --> 02:26.730
and he's the one I really hate.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.358
-Okay.
-I was--

02:29.441 --> 02:31.151
-Bye. I'll see you later.
-Yeah. Okay.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.986
Have a good weekend, okay?

02:34.696 --> 02:37.824
Hey, Victor, was that too real?

02:37.908 --> 02:40.577
Oh, you were good.
No. Just the right amount of real.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.287
-Yeah. Bye.
-Bye.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.962
If you wanna go
And take a ride with me

02:50.045 --> 02:52.548
We three-wheeling in the fo'
With the gold D's

02:52.631 --> 02:57.469
Oh, why do I live...
Hey, must be the money!

02:57.553 --> 03:02.057
If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke an L in the back of the Benz E

03:02.140 --> 03:06.770
Oh, why must I feel...
Hey, must be the money!

03:18.699 --> 03:19.700
-Dude.
-Yo.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.244
-What is going on? Is that Bolognese?
-No, sir.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.872
-This is my special lasagna sauce.
-Jesus. Really?

03:24.955 --> 03:27.416
-Can you not say his name, please?
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.418
-Gabi's coming tomorrow.
-She's not here, right?

03:29.501 --> 03:31.128
No, but it might slip in front of her.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.672
-Okay, but wait. That's for Gabi?
-Yes.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.507
But she's not coming till tomorrow.

03:35.591 --> 03:38.051
She's not. But she doesn't like
to cook with me anymore,

03:38.135 --> 03:39.553
so I just lose that time with her.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.890
-So I figured I'd do it the day before.
-Right, but what are you gonna do?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.933
Just cook all this
then put it in the fridge?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.060
What?

03:47.144 --> 03:48.979
You can have some
when she's done tomorrow.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.231
But I'm just saying
if I allocate my portion--

03:51.315 --> 03:52.983
What is this thing with this negotiation?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.359
-What's wrong with you?
-So it's fresh--

03:54.443 --> 03:56.236
-Get the fuck out of my kitchen, please.
-Okay.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.321
Oh, shit.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.199
Fuck.

04:31.688 --> 04:32.689
-Hola.
-Hey.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.733
Gabi, Dad's here!

04:35.817 --> 04:38.654
Wow, that's real jungle-y, sorta.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.657
It's not jungle-y.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.284
No, no, you look good
is what I was trying to--

04:50.624 --> 04:51.792
Gaba Gaba, what's up?

04:52.668 --> 04:54.753
You gonna leave me hanging? Hello?

04:56.755 --> 04:57.756
What's that about?

04:58.674 --> 05:01.885
A group of girls slept over
at Adriana's last night.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.554
And she wasn't invited.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.222
-Why not?
-I don't know.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.474
That's what it's been like the whole day.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.603
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You need to change into something else.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.189
-Why?
-Gabi, just listen to your mom.

05:14.273 --> 05:16.441
-I'm good.
-Oy.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.363
-Good luck.
-Yeah.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.453
So, what do you want?

05:29.079 --> 05:30.330
I said I wasn't hungry.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.916
I know, but it's lunchtime.
You need to eat something, right?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.503
Yeah, but just because it's lunchtime
doesn't mean I have to be hungry.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.213
I'm trying to listen to my body.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.049
Okay. Your bod-- Okay.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.135
How about I get you something now

05:43.218 --> 05:45.846
and then you just eat it later
when you do get hungry?

05:45.929 --> 05:48.599
-Do you want a spicy chicken?
-Do they have anything vegan?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.642
What, are you vegan now?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.979
It's not that I'm vegan,
I'm just eating vegan.

05:54.062 --> 05:57.107
But you're not vegan. You had
a Dodger Dog the last time I saw you.

05:57.191 --> 06:00.360
Yeah, and it was disgusting.
My stomach hurt for three days.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.487
Yeah, your stomach hurt
'cause you're not regular.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.947
-Stop.
-You've never been regular.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.407
Stop talking. I'm not hungry.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.243
-Can we just leave?
-We're at a drive-through.

06:08.327 --> 06:11.079
Okay? There's a car in front of me,
one behind me, the curb right there

06:11.163 --> 06:12.164
and a big-ass menu.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.875
-Where do you want me to go?
-So we just have to sit here?

06:14.958 --> 06:17.002
I'm gonna get myself
a spicy chicken sandwich,

06:17.085 --> 06:19.087
and then you can do whatever you want.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.797
How's that? That sound good?

06:22.216 --> 06:24.801
Cool? Cool.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.137
At least I can poop okay.

06:35.938 --> 06:36.939
Hey.

06:39.608 --> 06:40.609
Hey.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.071
-You all right?
-Yeah.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.364
What are you doing?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.325
Just looking out the window.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.414
-Hey, Gabi's here.
-Okay.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.543
-Do you need me to do-- Okay.
-I'm good. Hey, Gabi.

06:57.626 --> 06:58.627
Hey.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.547
Okay. Go put your stuff down.
I'm taking you on a hike.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.382
I can't. I have too much homework.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.343
You always say the same thing,
then you're on the phone with friends.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.594
Doing homework.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.347
You need air, okay? Humans need air.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.349
This is air. I have air.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.935
-Isn't this pretty?
-I guess.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.564
-Well, it gets even prettier.
-When?

07:18.647 --> 07:19.648
Soon.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.234
Why didn't we go to the Dodger game?

07:22.734 --> 07:23.735
Are you serious?

07:23.819 --> 07:26.572
-Two weeks ago you said it was terrible.
-I didn't say that.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.824
You literally said,
"I never wanna come here again."

07:28.907 --> 07:31.660
Whatever.
I'm ready to turn around whenever you are.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.745
Come on. Aren't you vegan?

07:33.829 --> 07:35.622
You should be into
all this exercise stuff.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.375
-No?
-That's a stereotype.

07:40.669 --> 07:41.879
Everything cool?

07:44.715 --> 07:46.717
Hey, can you do that later, please?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.428
-No, I can't.
-Come on, we're in nature. Come on.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.513
Hey. Whatever it is,

07:51.597 --> 07:53.390
-I'm sure it can wait--
-It actually can't.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.933
These aren't your friends,
they're my friends.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.269
I'm sorry, but you don't know
what you're talking about.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.646
Okay. I have friends too, you know.

07:59.730 --> 08:03.525
-It's not the same thing at all.
-Yeah, but I remember what it was like.

08:03.609 --> 08:04.943
I'm sure it was different then.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.571
I'm sure it was,
but I bet it's also kind of the same.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.366
Like I know how girls can be.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.827
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.121
Okay. How can girls be?

08:17.122 --> 08:20.709
Really mean, you know?
Especially to each other.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.837
Whatever.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.843
Mija, if you ever feel,
like, left out or something,

08:29.927 --> 08:31.470
you know I'm always here, right?

08:31.553 --> 08:33.347
I'm always gonna be here.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.933
You know? Always. I'm not going anywhere.

08:36.517 --> 08:41.063
Did Mom tell you about Adriana?
Why did she tell you? She's so stupid.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.815
Hey. You do not call your mother that.
Do you understand me?

08:44.983 --> 08:46.818
Okay. That's enough. Give me the phone.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.404
-No. Dad, I have to do this.
-Yeah. I've asked you nicely.

08:49.488 --> 08:50.989
-No, you don't. Give me the phone.
-No.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.324
-I'll give it back to you after.
-Let go.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.408
Just give me the phone.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.744
Mija, I pay for this phone
so give me the damn phone.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.955
Get your fucking hands off of me!

09:01.708 --> 09:04.962
Listen to me. None of this matters, okay?
It doesn't matter.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.965
You think it does because your head
is buried in it all the time, okay?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.551
Don't look at it for a day,
and you're gonna feel so much better.

09:10.634 --> 09:11.635
Trust me.

09:13.762 --> 09:14.972
You're so old.

09:24.606 --> 09:28.902
All I did was have a vision.
And I tried to achieve that vision.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.614
And I tried to spread love doing it.

09:38.287 --> 09:41.623
I love you guys. I really do.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.294
Okay.

09:47.921 --> 09:48.922
Bye.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.341
Okay. So you see what I'm talking about?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.802
She was totally faking it at some point,
though.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.221
-You're missing the whole point.
-No, but towards the middle.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.307
Didn't you feel that?
Like she was sniffling too hard?

09:58.390 --> 09:59.600
-Dad, listen to me.
-What?

09:59.683 --> 10:00.851
After this video dropped,

10:00.934 --> 10:03.228
-she lost 75,000 subscribers.
-Right.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.772
And it's not like she could
be in China in the factory

10:05.856 --> 10:08.942
to make sure it's all safe
and there's no mercury in the lipsticks.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.819
So technically, it's not really on her.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.155
But everyone's making it seem
like she's a problem,

10:13.238 --> 10:15.199
and they don't even know
how hard she works.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.242
-Do you know how hard she works?
-Yeah.

10:17.326 --> 10:21.747
She gets up at 6:30 a.m.,
takes two hours for her hair and makeup.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.124
And then she shoots
and edits the whole thing herself.

10:24.208 --> 10:27.377
So it's not really fair
just because one little thing goes wrong,

10:27.461 --> 10:28.962
the whole community turns on her.

10:29.046 --> 10:32.216
Well, it's not one little thing.
She sold poison makeup, right?

10:32.299 --> 10:36.553
That's-- That's super dangerous.
You should be getting called out, I feel.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.388
-Oh, my God. Are you serious?
-Yeah.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.974
Do you know how many people
she supported when they were down,

10:41.058 --> 10:42.935
but when she's down,
no one wants to support her?

10:43.018 --> 10:44.937
-Okay, you don't have to get like that.
-Like what?

10:45.020 --> 10:47.147
So emotional, honey. It's just my opinion.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.150
-You always do this.
-Do what?

10:50.651 --> 10:53.111
-Make me feel stupid for liking things.
-Come on.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.656
-That's not what I was trying to do.
-Just forget it.

10:58.951 --> 10:59.952
All right.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.372
How about we just call it a night?

11:04.623 --> 11:06.500
-Get some sleep.
-Fine.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.337
Come on.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.466
I'm just gonna watch TV. I'm not tired.

11:14.550 --> 11:17.052
Come on.
It's already past your bedtime. Let's go.

11:17.135 --> 11:20.264
-My bedtime?
-It's late. Whatever. Let's go.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.266
-It's a Saturday.
-Dude, I've already been cool.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.351
Your mom would never
let you stay up this late.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.312
-Don't make this about her.
-I'm not. Can you just get up, please?

11:28.146 --> 11:29.940
-No.
-I am not doing this with you.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.192
Please get up. I'm tired. Please get up.

11:32.276 --> 11:35.737
I'm not gonna let you stay on the couch,
okay? It's not right. Please. Thank you.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.823
God. Why does it have to be so hard?

11:41.869 --> 11:43.912
Yeah, of-- Hey.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.874
It's totally fine. Who cares?

11:46.957 --> 11:50.335
Look. We'll just flip one of these.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.800
You see? I mean,

11:56.884 --> 11:59.052
-that's a pizza stain right there--
-I really don't care.

12:00.262 --> 12:03.098
Look, I know you don't like to talk
about bodily stuff with me.

12:03.182 --> 12:04.933
-Dad.
-But period accidents are super normal.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.018
Just stop talking.

12:06.101 --> 12:08.061
This girl I dated in high school
had 'em all the time.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.980
Shut up! Just shut up, okay?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.900
I didn't even wanna be here this weekend.
Mom made me come.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.404
All right,

12:18.071 --> 12:20.240
what would you be doing
at Mom's differently?

12:20.324 --> 12:23.327
I would be in my own bed
and use Mom's heating pad.

12:24.494 --> 12:28.457
We don't have a heating pad,
but we can just make our own.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.125
-Oh, God.
-No, no, no. I got this.

12:30.792 --> 12:31.960
Just stay there.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.921
One second.

12:51.146 --> 12:54.066
Hey. I heated up a towel.
It's just like a heating pad.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.526
I don't want it.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.861
It'll work just the same, I promise.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.489
-It's not gonna work the same.
-You haven't even tried it.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.407
Can you please just go away?

13:05.035 --> 13:07.037
Is there anything else I can do for you?

13:11.583 --> 13:12.584
Okay.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.159
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, just cramps.

13:47.703 --> 13:51.164
-These guys have a heating pad?
-No, of course not.

13:59.590 --> 14:03.302
You know what?
I have something that works for me.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.845
I can show you if you want.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.346
Really?

14:12.060 --> 14:13.437
Is that your room?

14:13.520 --> 14:16.481
Well, it's my dad's room,
but I just use it when I'm here.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.066
You know, he sleeps on the couch.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.403
Just don't look at the stupid stuff
on the walls.

14:25.908 --> 14:29.036
You'll see.
This will relieve the pressure.

14:31.622 --> 14:33.540
Oh, my gosh. I already feel it.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.125
Good.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.176
Hi.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.303
Oh. Hello.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.263
I didn't mean to interrupt. You're good.

14:49.181 --> 14:52.434
-Dad, this is Caroline.
-Hi, Caroline. I'm Victor.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.020
Hi. I'm friends with...

14:56.605 --> 14:57.814
Oh, my God.

14:58.482 --> 14:59.775
Josh?

14:59.858 --> 15:01.193
Yeah.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.862
I forget his name all the time. It's okay.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.822
She came into the bathroom
when I in was there.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.617
But she wanted to show me this thing
that she learned in dance,

15:08.700 --> 15:11.119
and it's actually really helping
with the cramps.

15:11.203 --> 15:14.248
He wanted me to use a hot towel
'cause he doesn't have a heating pad.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.293
Well, I've done that, and it works.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.885
Actually, that looks kind of nice.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.888
-Do you guys mind if I... hop on?
-Yeah. Come on.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.057
It's good for your lower back.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.684
Okay, let's see.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.602
-Okay.
-Just scoot in there.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.231
Oh, God. Yeah, it is.

15:40.065 --> 15:42.401
So, how long have you known Josh?

15:44.069 --> 15:46.655
We started talking, I guess, last week.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.283
-Talking?
-Texting.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.993
Are you gonna keep texting?

15:52.786 --> 15:54.872
Honestly, probably not.

16:02.421 --> 16:03.755
So the sex was bad?

16:17.227 --> 16:18.228
Hey.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.357
Could you hurry up, please?
I don't wanna be late.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.651
Gabi?

16:24.735 --> 16:27.196
-Almost.
-Okay, thank you.

16:27.696 --> 16:28.822
In, like, ten.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.220
So where'd you get your new kicks?

16:52.304 --> 16:53.305
What?

16:53.388 --> 16:55.849
Come on. The Air Jordans.
Where'd you get 'em?

16:56.433 --> 16:57.726
You went into my stuff?

16:58.352 --> 17:00.729
You're walking around
with a brand-new pair of shoes all week

17:00.812 --> 17:02.231
and not wearing them once.

17:02.314 --> 17:04.148
What's up with that? What's the deal?

17:04.233 --> 17:05.733
Nothing. They're mine.

17:06.609 --> 17:09.320
I know your mom
didn't buy you a $120 pair of shoes.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.448
She just didn't. So where'd you get 'em?

17:11.531 --> 17:12.699
I borrowed them, okay?

17:12.782 --> 17:15.661
Okay. Then why you gettin' so defensive
if you just borrowed them?

17:15.743 --> 17:16.828
-Because.
-Why?

17:16.912 --> 17:18.121
You don't trust me.

17:18.664 --> 17:22.125
No. That's not true. I do trust you.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.212
But I trust you to always
tell me the truth, right?

17:28.882 --> 17:33.679
I just borrowed them from Adriana, okay?
I was gonna give them back, okay?

17:33.762 --> 17:36.515
Just after the picture,
I was gonna give them back to her.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.393
I just wanted to take
a cute photo for Vincent.

17:41.603 --> 17:42.688
All right.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.484
Damn. Are we really so not close
that you can't just come to me

17:47.568 --> 17:49.194
and tell me you need some new shoes,
honey?

17:49.278 --> 17:51.530
-Why are you making this about you?
-I'm not. It's about you.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.656
You stole from your friend.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.449
I was gonna give them back
after the picture.

17:54.533 --> 17:57.119
Yeah, but that's the worst part of it.
Right? That's the worst part.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.913
That you just wanted some shoes to what,
to bring some boy to the yard?

17:59.997 --> 18:01.206
That's ridiculous.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.250
-You don't know anything.
-Yeah, I know everything.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.752
-The same way that I know that you are--
-Yeah, yeah. I know.

18:05.836 --> 18:06.879
I've heard it.

18:06.962 --> 18:10.132
I'm super great and I'm super kind,
and that's why a guy will like me.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.383
-Yeah.
-Yeah, nah.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.218
That's not what I was gonna say at all.

18:13.302 --> 18:15.596
You've been acting like
a real pain in the ass all weekend,

18:15.679 --> 18:17.681
and now I find out
you're a little thief too?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.184
Yeah. At least I know
I'm not gonna be some driver

18:20.267 --> 18:22.519
who can't even afford his own place.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.074
I am proud of my job.

18:36.992 --> 18:38.202
You understand me?

18:38.869 --> 18:40.579
And I'm damn good at it too.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.832
And the only reason I live with Josh

18:43.916 --> 18:46.418
is so I can give you
everything that you need.

18:49.713 --> 18:51.632
You look at my life
and you think it's sad.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.967
Nah, mija. No, that's not it.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.639
And if you think
that the only type of good life

18:58.722 --> 19:00.140
comes with Air Jordans...

19:02.726 --> 19:04.937
life is gonna disappoint you real hard.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.189
-You have everything?
-Yeah.

19:49.273 --> 19:50.858
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

19:50.941 --> 19:51.942
Okay.

19:59.408 --> 20:01.618
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Hola.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.120
How was your weekend?

20:04.496 --> 20:07.541
No "Hello"? No nothing.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.545
I stole Adriana's Air Jordans.

20:12.129 --> 20:13.881
-This weekend?
-No, before.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.800
Okay, so that's why.

20:16.884 --> 20:19.052
But while I was at church, I made a plan.

20:19.136 --> 20:22.139
I can do little jobs for you guys
and babysit for Jessica just until,

20:22.222 --> 20:24.600
you know, I have enough money
to buy back her Jordans.

20:24.683 --> 20:27.394
Yeah, that's a good start, but you're
also grounded for the next month.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.229
Grounded? No one grounds anyone anymore.

20:29.313 --> 20:31.231
You talk about kids getting grounded
all the time.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.816
-Fuck this.
-Hey!

20:32.900 --> 20:35.360
You keep talking that way,
it's gonna be two months. Understand?

20:35.444 --> 20:37.446
Okay, so now you guys
are working together.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.531
Maybe you should've done that
when you were married.

20:39.615 --> 20:41.033
-Two months!
-Gabi.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.911
-Where is this shit coming from?
-Well, maybe from you guys.

20:43.994 --> 20:46.788
Like you guys are both so good.
You're dating a married man.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.208
And you have some strange woman
staying at your house.

20:49.291 --> 20:52.211
For real. Neither one of you
have any idea what you're doing.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.923
-She's not my strange woman.
-Richard's--

20:56.006 --> 20:58.217
-They're almost divorced, so--
-It was Josh's girlfriend.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.260
-Not that you can own a woman--
-I don't know why I...

21:00.344 --> 21:02.513
You don't have to explain yourself to me.

21:04.056 --> 21:05.849
Why is she making us do this?

21:05.933 --> 21:07.392
-Your daughter.
-She's yours.

21:07.476 --> 21:09.895
-Are you sure?
-Well, yeah. She's yours.

21:13.357 --> 21:15.067
Are we fucking this all up?

21:15.943 --> 21:18.237
-Not all of it. No.
-You sure?

21:18.320 --> 21:19.321
Probably some of it.

21:20.239 --> 21:23.492
-We're better than most people, though.
-Better than our parents were.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.077
-Better than your parents were.
-Hey.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.037
What? Did you say something?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.248
-I heard something.
-No. It's just my accent.

21:32.876 --> 21:35.212
-Listen, I gotta-- Yeah.
-I don't mean to keep you. Go ahead.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.381
Good luck in there.
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

21:37.464 --> 21:38.674
All right.
