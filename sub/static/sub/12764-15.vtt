00:26.030 --> 00:27.200
I make things happen.

00:27.210 --> 00:29.210
I made lights explode.

00:29.220 --> 00:30.860
I shattered a skylight.

00:30.910 --> 00:32.150
You did?

00:32.159 --> 00:33.190
How did we do that?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.410
What's the trick?

00:34.420 --> 00:36.240
Once you teach your mind to alter

00:36.250 --> 00:38.120
The positive and negative polarity
of the cells in your

00:38.130 --> 00:38.920
body--

00:38.930 --> 00:40.540
- The glass will move.
- Not the glass.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.490
The water inside it.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.960
She looks happy.

00:44.530 --> 00:45.880
That's not me.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.890
I think it could be you someday.

00:48.190 --> 00:49.730
How could you be my father?

00:50.450 --> 00:53.050
It's time you learned the truth
about who you really are.

00:53.150 --> 00:55.420
Kyle's very special,
but you already know that.

00:55.830 --> 01:00.950
All he's ever wanted was to be
a part of your family.

01:01.950 --> 01:03.550
To Kyle, this is home.

01:13.420 --> 01:14.650
A new day.

01:14.830 --> 01:16.610
The future full of promise.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.550
Now that my family knew all of my secrets,

01:19.940 --> 01:21.730
I felt free,

01:22.810 --> 01:24.510
Like I could do anything.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.830
Even while facing the future,

01:28.970 --> 01:31.140
I knew there were some lessons from the past worth

01:31.150 --> 01:32.450
remembering.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.610
As Adam taught me,

01:50.660 --> 01:53.080
I was able to manipulate
the polarity of the cells in my

01:53.090 --> 01:54.250
body,

01:54.340 --> 01:57.040
using my own water content
against the water on the ground,

01:57.530 --> 01:59.860
like two magnets fighting to come together.

02:05.780 --> 02:07.080
Kyle?

02:11.290 --> 02:12.440
Beautiful day.

02:14.710 --> 02:16.560
I spoke to Amanda yesterday.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.180
She's doing great.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.040
Yes. Yes, she is.

02:22.110 --> 02:23.270
Have a nice day.

02:32.140 --> 02:33.990
Mrs. Bloom thinks I can levitate.

02:34.580 --> 02:37.100
- Can you?
- Not exactly.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.070
I was trying to do something Adam taught me,

02:39.080 --> 02:40.170
And I think she saw.

02:40.180 --> 02:42.570
You have to be careful, even in our backyard.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.210
Especially with a neighbor like Carol Bloom.

02:44.220 --> 02:46.370
We have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.650
Jessi starts back at school today.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.890
Well, just take the high road.

02:50.900 --> 02:51.870
Do your best to avoid her.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.250
Have you spoken to her since she moved in with Taylor?

02:54.280 --> 02:57.040
No. I still don't believe he's her father.

02:57.050 --> 02:58.800
She doesn't have a real father.

02:58.810 --> 03:00.630
She's another pod child like you.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.540
Genetically, she does match Taylor.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.680
Yeah, but there are ways to fix paternity tests.

03:04.690 --> 03:06.580
We know that from the Petersons.

03:06.590 --> 03:08.090
Well, until we can prove otherwise,

03:08.100 --> 03:09.880
I'm afraid we can't take any action.

03:10.820 --> 03:12.260
Is it really any of our business?

03:12.270 --> 03:15.790
Well, I want to be sure she's in the right situation.

03:15.810 --> 03:17.630
And living with Brian Taylor isn't.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.330
He lied when he brought Kyle back to us.

03:20.340 --> 03:22.480
He was involved with Ballantine at Madacorp.

03:22.490 --> 03:24.150
I know you're concerned abut Jessi,

03:24.160 --> 03:25.780
And if she needs our help, we're here.

03:25.970 --> 03:28.400
But this family needs to focus on what's ahead.

03:29.680 --> 03:30.840
Agreed?

03:31.980 --> 03:33.320
Agreed.

03:38.550 --> 03:41.610
So what the hell are we supposed to talk about?

03:55.060 --> 03:59.000
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 15:
The Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades</font>

04:10.780 --> 04:12.050
Career days?

04:12.060 --> 04:14.040
Second best thing to summer break.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.240
Why?

04:15.250 --> 04:17.010
Half days of school, dude.

04:17.019 --> 04:19.040
Free ride on the party express.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.740
We're supposed to be browsing the career booths

04:20.750 --> 04:22.450
Contemplating our futures.

04:22.710 --> 04:23.980
What's to contemplate?

04:23.990 --> 04:25.600
Self-made millionaire.

04:25.620 --> 04:27.250
Homeless street musician.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.200
Global superhero.

04:29.780 --> 04:31.340
Let's waste some time!

04:32.050 --> 04:34.300
He's right. these things are a waste of space.

04:35.430 --> 04:37.150
Why does Madacorp have a booth here?

04:37.160 --> 04:39.150
Don't worry. They do every year.

04:41.210 --> 04:42.820
What the hell is Hillary doing?

04:42.830 --> 04:45.850
Coming at you from Beachwood's annual career fair,

04:46.120 --> 04:48.870
I'm Hillary, and I'm fabulous.

04:50.450 --> 04:51.740
Hello, fabulous friends!

04:51.750 --> 04:54.250
I thought that TV reality show rejected you already.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.170
Oh, reality TV is so five minutes ago.

04:56.180 --> 04:57.820
I'm on a new path.

04:58.410 --> 05:01.400
Sexy high school correspondent.

05:01.410 --> 05:03.930
I'm gonna be the "Queen of Fabulous."

05:04.780 --> 05:06.160
Do they have a booth for that?

05:06.850 --> 05:08.440
When did he get funny?

05:08.670 --> 05:09.650
Think about it.

05:09.660 --> 05:12.040
Paris, Nicole, the "lonely15" chickie.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.400
They're all famous because they're hot and visible.

05:14.410 --> 05:15.820
It's not that hard.

05:16.010 --> 05:19.280
That is both valid and delusional all at the the same time.

05:19.290 --> 05:21.500
A few video blogs in the school's web site,

05:21.510 --> 05:24.510
And I'll be on my way to world-wide notoriety.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.340
Did you hear that? it's "party thirty."

05:28.350 --> 05:31.030
Preston hid a few of his treats inside his gym locker.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.050
Now that is fabulous.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.100
- Kyle, are you coming?
- Oh, no.

05:35.110 --> 05:37.220
Remember the puker from Declan's party?

05:37.520 --> 05:38.480
This guy.

05:38.490 --> 05:40.880
Eww! Then none for you, little cupcake.

05:40.890 --> 05:42.020
Bye!

05:45.950 --> 05:47.050
Lori was right.

05:47.060 --> 05:48.760
I could do whatever I wanted.

05:49.370 --> 05:52.730
Engineering. architecture.

05:53.050 --> 05:54.490
Medicine.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.810
I had spent my life figuring out who I was,

05:58.370 --> 06:01.390
And now was my chance to figure out who I could become.

06:14.780 --> 06:17.250
So what's a hottie like you doing in a place like this?

06:17.580 --> 06:20.340
Is that what counts for a pick-up line on your planet?

06:20.350 --> 06:21.910
Only for girls with pink hair.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.360
I shudder to think what the redheads get.

06:25.990 --> 06:27.330
What do you think?

06:28.130 --> 06:29.750
I think you should wait to see if you actually lose your

06:29.760 --> 06:30.150
hair.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.860
Before you start wearing a wig.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.010
Meanwhile, let's bust out of here.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.860
And?

06:37.870 --> 06:39.130
Lock ourselves in the bathroom

06:39.140 --> 06:40.350
And play G-Force.

06:40.380 --> 06:41.550
Nah.

06:42.340 --> 06:43.810
When have you ever turned down

06:43.820 --> 06:45.390
An opportunity to kick my ass?

06:45.400 --> 06:47.000
I wanna take a look around.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.840
You mean, like, job search?

06:51.220 --> 06:52.810
Why so skeptical?

06:52.820 --> 06:55.350
It would be just my luck to blow off the career fair,

06:55.360 --> 06:56.850
Get cured of cancer,

06:56.860 --> 06:58.870
And be totally unprepared for my future.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.090
Okay.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.910
Is there something wrong with me believing

07:01.920 --> 07:03.990
I'll live to see my first crappy adult job?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.480
- Nope.
- You hate the wig, don't you?

07:06.490 --> 07:08.220
- Hate it.
- And you think I'm ugly.

07:08.230 --> 07:08.980
You're ugly, and you're disease-ridden.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.270
I never want to touch you again.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.210
You're totally getting the hang of me.

07:12.610 --> 07:14.170
It's our thing, remember?

07:17.860 --> 07:20.600
Mr. Trager. leaving so soon?

07:21.150 --> 07:22.840
I was just going to the bathroom.

07:22.850 --> 07:24.060
Of course you were.

07:24.070 --> 07:27.100
Why am I not surprised that this fair holds no interest for

07:27.110 --> 07:28.250
you?

07:30.890 --> 07:33.280
Stephen! Wait!

07:33.750 --> 07:35.740
I didn't expect to see you here.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.030
Just grabbing a few of my things.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.440
Could you just give me a minute?

07:43.870 --> 07:46.260
I know what happened with Ballantine was horrible,

07:46.270 --> 07:48.490
But his agenda was his own, not Madacorp's.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.910
And you were just following orders.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.560
The point is he's gone,

07:51.570 --> 07:53.460
And I'm the one giving orders now.

07:53.510 --> 07:55.430
Congratulations.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.200
Can we just put our personal differences aside

07:59.210 --> 08:00.480
And remember that Madacorp is,

08:00.490 --> 08:03.640
and always has been, a great company.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.610
We're making huge strides.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.250
State-of-the-art in every department.

08:07.260 --> 08:10.700
And I want you to stay and continue to contribute.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.510
I'll give you greater creative freedom,

08:13.520 --> 08:15.920
Increase your support team and your salary.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.270
You'll do very well at this job.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.990
What we offer here you won't find anywhere else.

08:28.530 --> 08:30.070
I'm counting on that.

08:41.570 --> 08:44.080
Are you interested in architecture?

08:48.300 --> 08:50.530
This structure won't support 40 units.

08:51.690 --> 08:53.130
Try to move the foundation beams to the center

08:53.140 --> 08:54.960
to offset the weight distribution.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.060
How the hell did you see that?

09:02.840 --> 09:04.250
I read a lot.

09:13.430 --> 09:15.160
- Hey.
- Glad to be back?

09:15.380 --> 09:16.610
Sort of.

09:18.260 --> 09:19.700
How are things going with Taylor?

09:20.520 --> 09:22.340
I know you don't trust him,

09:22.350 --> 09:23.800
But he's taking good care of me.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.590
He told me all about the girl in the picture, Sara.

09:26.750 --> 09:29.370
She was part of the original experiment, just like Adam.

09:30.150 --> 09:31.870
Adam said he was the only one.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.730
Not according to Brian.

09:34.810 --> 09:37.440
He said he created me from Sara's genetic material after

09:37.450 --> 09:38.580
she died

09:39.080 --> 09:40.600
Based on Adam's experiments.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.180
Why didn't he mention her?

09:43.780 --> 09:45.100
I don't know.

09:45.610 --> 09:47.350
Maybe you can ask him someday.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.460
You didn't mention anything to Taylor about Adam being

09:52.470 --> 09:53.810
alive, did you?

09:54.340 --> 09:56.450
No. You told me not to.

09:56.920 --> 09:57.480
I know, but--

09:57.490 --> 09:58.850
I'm different now.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.400
You made me different.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.760
If I make you a promise, I'm going to keep it.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.710
Okay.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.800
Are you as bored as I am?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.110
No.

10:13.090 --> 10:13.280
Actually,

10:13.290 --> 10:15.650
there's a neurology booth that looked really interesting.

10:16.460 --> 10:17.960
- Kyle.
- What?

10:17.970 --> 10:19.830
I don't wanna spend the entire day

10:19.840 --> 10:21.920
Thinking about what I'm gonna do 20 years from now.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.430
Well, what do you want to do?

10:25.900 --> 10:27.490
Just get out of here for a bit.

10:27.810 --> 10:29.120
Wanna come with?

10:33.030 --> 10:34.270
Come on.

10:59.290 --> 11:01.750
My first day back, and I'm already suffocating.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.460
You didn't exactly get a right start the first time around.

11:06.170 --> 11:07.330
But it's a new beginning.

11:07.340 --> 11:08.930
I think you'll learn to like it here.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.500
Well, everything we need to know, we can learn on our own.

11:12.030 --> 11:13.270
Not everything.

11:13.410 --> 11:15.630
They definitely can't teach us to do the special things we

11:15.640 --> 11:16.690
can do.

11:17.770 --> 11:20.300
Have you busted any skylights lately?

11:20.660 --> 11:22.170
Haven't felt the urge.

11:22.270 --> 11:23.720
Exploded any lights?

11:23.730 --> 11:25.440
Been there, done that.

11:27.990 --> 11:30.270
There's so much more we can try.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.390
I mean, don't you ever feel like just busting out

11:33.400 --> 11:35.540
And doing something amazing ever now and then?

11:36.450 --> 11:37.950
I kind of did this morning.

11:38.570 --> 11:39.840
What'd you do?

11:40.190 --> 11:41.800
I sort of levitated.

11:42.190 --> 11:44.240
- Really?
- Only slightly.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.750
I don't care. Show me how.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.200
I will. But we can't start with that.

11:48.210 --> 11:49.530
You have to work your way up to it.

11:49.540 --> 11:51.070
No, I don't wanna work on anything.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.240
I just wanna do something now.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.600
There's not much we can do up here.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.430
We should get back.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.910
What, to the fascinating career fair?

12:05.960 --> 12:07.190
You never know.

12:07.530 --> 12:09.280
Something might inspire you.

12:13.370 --> 12:14.500
Fine.

12:46.570 --> 12:47.970
Amanda, hi, it's me

12:47.990 --> 12:49.680
Sorry I missed you,

12:49.870 --> 12:52.630
But I've been thinking about you, and I wanted to call--

12:52.700 --> 12:53.780
Uh...

12:54.570 --> 12:56.120
I'll call you later.

13:02.570 --> 13:05.250
- Fabulousness confirmed.
- Excuse me?

13:05.260 --> 13:08.200
Hello! My newest video blog is on the school's web site,

13:08.235 --> 13:11.060
And it already has over 500 hits.

13:11.130 --> 13:13.900
Wow. That's a big jump from the six who saw your last one.

13:13.910 --> 13:14.990
I know, right?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.780
At this rate, I'll be youtubed by dinner.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.580
Shoo shoo! Let the star see her work.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.190
Until next time, I'm Hillary, and I'm fabulous.

13:28.820 --> 13:30.810
Who is that ruining my shot?

13:47.120 --> 13:49.280
Please tell me you're not joining the wrestling team.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.000
You don't exactly have the body to fill out those little

13:51.010 --> 13:51.960
outfits.

13:51.970 --> 13:54.150
It's a punishment for blowing off the career fair,

13:54.160 --> 13:56.140
Courtesy of our friendly neighborhood principal.

13:56.150 --> 13:58.670
Why do you continually do this to yourself?

13:58.680 --> 14:01.470
Cause it's the one thing I'm really good at?

14:02.160 --> 14:04.090
- Josh.
- What?

14:04.450 --> 14:06.370
Hooper's right. I am lazy.

14:06.380 --> 14:07.630
My work ethic does suck,

14:07.640 --> 14:08.940
and I really don't care about school.

14:08.950 --> 14:11.830
Don't expect me to ride shotgun on your "woe is me"

14:11.840 --> 14:12.810
interstate.

14:12.820 --> 14:14.530
You're smart, and you know it.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.560
So get off your ass and start making something of yourself.

14:18.620 --> 14:21.080
I could always follow in Hillary's footsteps

14:21.090 --> 14:22.510
And film myself in a low-cut halter top.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.640
She's got a little more than her D-cup working for her.

14:24.650 --> 14:26.660
She's got "The Mystery Jumper."

14:27.200 --> 14:28.210
The who?

14:28.220 --> 14:29.090
Some video trick.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.990
It looks like someone's jumping off the roof.

14:32.050 --> 14:33.720
What makes you so sure it's a trick?

14:33.760 --> 14:36.630
Do you know anyone who can actually jump off a roof?

14:43.620 --> 14:45.280
Hard to believe I'm being responsible,

14:45.290 --> 14:47.110
but how are we supposed to keep your secret

14:47.120 --> 14:48.650
if she's out there leaping tall buildings in a single...

14:48.660 --> 14:49.760
whatever.

14:49.850 --> 14:52.020
I know it wasn't a smart thing to do,

14:52.030 --> 14:54.160
But I don't think anyone could tell it was her.

14:54.170 --> 14:55.550
I ran a hyper-zoom processor on it,

14:55.560 --> 14:58.410
And I couldn't make out a face, just a female form.

14:59.350 --> 15:00.840
Just how I like it.

15:01.550 --> 15:03.180
What?

15:04.040 --> 15:05.880
I'm on empty, dude.

15:05.910 --> 15:07.710
I've already told Andy all my secrets.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.260
If she finds out I'm hiding something, she'll kill me.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.300
I'll talk to Jessi.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.370
Hi, Jessi.

15:35.140 --> 15:37.010
Everybody's talking about me.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.600
They're talking about "The Mystery Jumper".

15:38.610 --> 15:39.780
There's a difference.

15:39.910 --> 15:41.660
What should I do for my next trick?

15:42.360 --> 15:43.670
How about nothing?

15:44.480 --> 15:45.980
Why not? It's fun.

15:46.910 --> 15:48.380
No one knows it's me.

15:48.650 --> 15:49.900
No one knows yet.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.590
Would it be so bad if they did?

15:55.800 --> 15:59.010
I did something this morning that someone saw.

15:59.650 --> 16:02.030
And by this afternoon, she had told three friends.

16:02.780 --> 16:05.000
And if those three friends tell three more,

16:05.310 --> 16:07.350
By this weekend, I'll have half of Seattle in my backyard

16:07.360 --> 16:09.550
Waiting for me to do something extraordinary.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.490
What's so wrong with that?

16:12.480 --> 16:14.990
Because then I won't be able to relax in my backyard.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.550
I won't be able to enjoy a quiet breakfast with my family

16:18.560 --> 16:20.480
Or a walk in the park with Amanda.

16:21.890 --> 16:23.790
I wanna figure out what I'm gonna do with my life

16:23.800 --> 16:25.350
Without people watching me,

16:25.680 --> 16:27.730
always waiting to see what I might do.

16:29.220 --> 16:31.050
At least people would notice you.

16:32.460 --> 16:34.840
Jessi, life shouldn't be about getting noticed.

16:40.780 --> 16:42.030
Look around.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.250
That girl over there tosses her hair

16:45.260 --> 16:47.140
Every time a new guy walks into the room.

16:49.170 --> 16:50.300
And those guys?

16:50.310 --> 16:52.060
They're pretending to read magazines.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.830
But really they're waiting to see

16:53.840 --> 16:55.760
if the girl wiping the counter is looking at them.

16:56.670 --> 16:57.850
And the girl wiping the counter

16:57.860 --> 16:59.870
is wearing a shirt that's two sizes too small

16:59.950 --> 17:02.040
so that the magazine guys will watch her.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.030
Hillary's decided to make a career out of being fabulous

17:06.040 --> 17:07.460
because girls that look just like her

17:07.470 --> 17:09.640
are on most of the covers of the magazines they sell here.

17:09.650 --> 17:11.790
So do you really think that life isn't about getting

17:11.800 --> 17:12.890
noticed?

17:15.640 --> 17:17.060
Please, Jessi.

17:18.180 --> 17:19.349
For me.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.390
No more tricks, okay?

17:28.620 --> 17:29.980
Promise?

17:33.240 --> 17:34.600
I promise.

17:50.400 --> 17:54.270
This message goes out to whoever faked that jump.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.280
You're nothing but a circus act.

17:56.290 --> 17:57.850
A one-hit wonder.

17:57.860 --> 18:00.460
By tomorrow, you'll be forgotten,

18:00.495 --> 18:01.880
and I'll still be here.

18:01.890 --> 18:04.900
Because I'm Hillary, and I'm fabulous.

18:07.330 --> 18:08.610
We've got a problem.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.640
Jessi was caught on video today

18:10.650 --> 18:12.110
jumping off the school roof.

18:12.410 --> 18:14.790
Off the roof?

18:15.480 --> 18:16.760
Yeah.

18:16.940 --> 18:19.270
The whole school's trying to figure out how it was done.

18:22.430 --> 18:25.380
- Which one is it?
- What do you mean, which?

18:25.390 --> 18:25.980
Well, they are two.

18:25.990 --> 18:27.810
The last one was posted an hour ago.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.710
When lounging by the pool this spring,

18:32.720 --> 18:34.080
It's important for guys to know

18:34.090 --> 18:37.040
That board shorts are nothing more than manly.

18:42.530 --> 18:43.800
Did she just...

18:49.880 --> 18:51.250
Can you do that?

18:51.510 --> 18:52.790
Probably.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.630
She has to quit showing off.

18:54.820 --> 18:56.730
The whole world will wanna know about her.

18:56.740 --> 18:58.570
I don't think Jessi would mind that.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.520
But if they know about her,

19:00.530 --> 19:02.380
Eventually, they'll know the truth about you.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.570
It should be your choice if and when you want that to

19:04.580 --> 19:05.670
happen.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.830
I don't.

19:07.220 --> 19:08.410
Not yet.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.180
What are we gonna do?

19:22.570 --> 19:25.090
Hey, look, it's her! she's "The Mystery Jumper"!

19:36.390 --> 19:37.440
Jessi.

19:38.060 --> 19:39.520
Jessi, you gotta tell me.

19:39.530 --> 19:41.090
How'd you pull off your last stunt?

19:41.250 --> 19:42.270
Stunt?

19:42.280 --> 19:44.180
I studied the footage, and there's, like,

19:44.190 --> 19:45.190
There's no cables or wires.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.480
Did you do something cgi?

19:46.500 --> 19:48.610
No, I just...did it.

19:48.860 --> 19:51.430
- You ran across water?
- Mm-hmm.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.550
I'm not believing that so much, but whatever,

19:54.560 --> 19:56.120
I'm totally hooked.

20:00.070 --> 20:02.320
So, our terms are set.

20:02.330 --> 20:04.220
First base, no tongue,

20:04.230 --> 20:07.130
To whoever figures out how the magician did her tricks.

20:07.640 --> 20:12.000
Is there any possibility for...second base?

20:12.010 --> 20:14.650
Dazzle me and we'll see.

20:17.150 --> 20:18.640
I don't think you should do this.

20:19.190 --> 20:22.040
I'm not really gonna actually let any of them feel me up.

20:23.230 --> 20:25.130
I mean give so much attention to Jessi.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.210
She's a hot story right now.

20:27.220 --> 20:28.500
And if I cover it,

20:28.510 --> 20:30.190
It puts the spotlight

20:30.200 --> 20:31.760
Back on me.

20:31.820 --> 20:34.550
How do you think she actually did it?

20:34.640 --> 20:36.740
Maybe the better angle is why she did it.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.260
Well, that's obvious.

20:38.340 --> 20:40.780
I mean, everyone's dying for their 15 minutes.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.470
You know, fame.

20:44.090 --> 20:45.130
I'm not.

20:45.140 --> 20:46.160
Please.

20:46.170 --> 20:47.980
You just need a gimmick.

20:47.990 --> 20:49.710
Figure out what makes you special.

20:49.810 --> 20:52.020
How are you different from everyone else?

20:53.360 --> 20:54.860
I'll work on that.

20:56.890 --> 20:58.000
Mr. Taylor.

20:58.910 --> 21:01.130
Mrs. Trager, I'm surprised to see you here.

21:01.140 --> 21:02.870
I'm surprised to be here.

21:03.030 --> 21:04.320
Is there a problem?

21:04.330 --> 21:05.770
I'm concerned about Jessi.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.300
Really? what's your concern?

21:09.460 --> 21:10.840
Well, first of all,

21:10.850 --> 21:12.530
I don't know what your interest is in her.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.050
Well, she's my daughter.

21:15.690 --> 21:17.270
Scientifically, perhaps,

21:17.280 --> 21:19.350
But there's a lot more to parenting than DNA.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.920
And based on her recent behavior,

21:20.930 --> 21:23.110
You haven't quite gotten a handle on it.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.380
I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.

21:25.390 --> 21:28.310
She's been getting herself filmed doing things

21:28.320 --> 21:30.070
no person should be able to do.

21:32.650 --> 21:35.090
It's on the school web site, the school blog.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.710
You didn't know?

21:37.790 --> 21:38.910
No.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.810
If that gets out, you'll have reporters and photographers,

21:41.820 --> 21:43.560
And whoever else wants to analyze Jessi,

21:43.570 --> 21:44.930
Showing up at your door.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.940
It's only a matter of time before that kind of circus leads

21:47.950 --> 21:49.370
to Kyle.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.480
I don't want that for him.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.160
I don't want that for Jessi either.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.230
Look,

21:59.270 --> 22:01.630
You can't know every little thing your kids are doing.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.380
You can't be with them 24 hours a day.

22:04.110 --> 22:06.480
But you can hold them accountable for their actions.

22:07.850 --> 22:09.530
If you really are Jessi's father,

22:09.540 --> 22:10.930
Start acting like it.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.220
There he is!

22:16.860 --> 22:19.360
Hey! Hey! Hey! Excuse me.

22:19.370 --> 22:21.510
You know that area you caught yesterday?

22:21.520 --> 22:24.350
That saved my firm 10 mil in construction costs.

22:24.740 --> 22:25.740
Glad I could help.

22:25.750 --> 22:28.030
No, my boss would love to have a sit-down with you.

22:28.340 --> 22:29.570
- A sit-down?
- Yeah.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.220
Have you ever considered engineering?

22:31.300 --> 22:32.690
I need to learn more about it.

22:32.700 --> 22:33.810
Look no further.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.240
Back off, folks. I got first dibs.

22:37.090 --> 22:39.470
Forget them. Here's your future.

22:39.540 --> 22:41.180
How to become a doctor.

22:41.690 --> 22:42.900
A doctor?

22:44.640 --> 22:45.790
Why?

22:46.230 --> 22:48.130
Hello? so you can save Andy.

22:48.620 --> 22:49.840
Josh--

22:50.030 --> 22:52.590
With your mind, maybe you could find a cure for cancer.

22:53.430 --> 22:55.750
I am definitely interested in medicine.

22:55.785 --> 22:56.920
Excellent.

22:57.060 --> 22:58.920
And arts and physics and carpentry.

22:58.930 --> 23:00.510
Carpentry?

23:00.610 --> 23:02.930
You wanna waste your smarts on lumber?

23:03.170 --> 23:05.800
I think if you wanna help Andy, you should become a doctor.

23:07.160 --> 23:08.350
No offense, dude.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.550
That's the stupidest thing you've ever said.

23:10.910 --> 23:12.330
Our brains are the same size.

23:12.340 --> 23:13.600
I just use more of mine.

23:13.610 --> 23:15.330
But it's so easy for you.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.370
I barely passed science.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.650
I'll help you.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.650
I'll take a Madacorp brochure.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.530
Hi.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.490
Start with oncology.

23:31.650 --> 23:32.850
On...what-ogy?

23:38.650 --> 23:40.100
Why are you here?

23:41.810 --> 23:44.370
Madacorp's always looking for students with potential.

23:44.380 --> 23:46.480
And what do you know? I just found one.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.800
I don't want anything to do with Madacorp.

23:48.990 --> 23:51.530
- Emily?
- Jessi.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.130
I was hoping I'd see you here today.

23:55.260 --> 23:56.640
I don't know if it'll mean much,

23:56.650 --> 23:58.640
but for what it's worth, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

23:59.290 --> 24:00.930
And I wanna make it up to you.

24:01.270 --> 24:02.520
How?

24:02.810 --> 24:04.290
Work with me,

24:04.300 --> 24:06.680
and I'll make sure that you're appreciated.

24:06.910 --> 24:09.820
People all over the world will be fascinated by your gifts.

24:09.830 --> 24:11.730
You'd be respected and admired.

24:11.740 --> 24:13.920
I mean, the possibilities are just so exciting.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.010
We should sit down and go through them all.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.740
- I'd love to.
- No.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.200
Why not?

24:24.210 --> 24:25.550
We need to talk.

24:28.350 --> 24:29.730
You know where to find me.

24:37.670 --> 24:39.310
How could you get involved with Emily after everything she

24:39.320 --> 24:40.510
did?

24:40.520 --> 24:42.300
You're just angry about the video.

24:43.260 --> 24:45.390
You promised me you wouldn't do anything.

24:45.870 --> 24:47.550
I don't wanna hide who I am.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.240
Who you are should be about your character, Jessi,

24:50.330 --> 24:52.800
Not about impressing people with the things you can do.

24:53.270 --> 24:55.530
Don't tell me what do do anymore.

24:55.540 --> 24:57.480
I'm just asking you to be careful.

24:57.490 --> 25:00.000
I'll do what I want, and I'll be who I want.

25:02.940 --> 25:04.280
You're right.

25:05.660 --> 25:07.150
You do what's best for you...

25:07.640 --> 25:09.130
And I'll do the same.

25:29.370 --> 25:31.160
Endless possibilities.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.220
That's what scares me.

25:33.620 --> 25:36.320
Kyle, you'll excel at anything you set your mind to.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.810
You just have to choose what interests you.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.180
It all interests me, that the problem.

25:42.690 --> 25:45.030
Maybe you're not destined to do just one thing.

25:45.340 --> 25:46.020
Look at Baylin.

25:46.030 --> 25:48.160
He was a scientist, an inventor,

25:48.310 --> 25:50.340
philosopher, writer.

25:50.700 --> 25:52.670
I wonder if he had a nosy neighbor

25:52.680 --> 25:54.150
And an uncontrollable friend.

25:54.250 --> 25:57.420
I'm sure he had his own set of problems.

26:00.550 --> 26:01.990
Am I wrong,

26:02.400 --> 26:04.330
Judging Jessi for what she's doing?

26:05.900 --> 26:08.590
Is it wrong for me to wanna keep this whole life to myself?

26:10.440 --> 26:13.380
I guess that depends on your reasons for wanting to hide it.

26:16.410 --> 26:18.990
I was watching this science documentary with Josh.

26:19.130 --> 26:21.240
Josh watched a documentary?

26:22.170 --> 26:24.890
It was hosted by one of those naked magazine rabbits.

26:25.190 --> 26:28.020
Bunnies. Okay, go on.

26:28.610 --> 26:30.030
Anyway,

26:30.380 --> 26:32.190
They kept a rat in a cage,

26:32.300 --> 26:34.180
and the scientists kept running tests

26:34.190 --> 26:37.180
and taking its blood and monitoring every mode that it made.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.510
And you don't want that to happen to you.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.250
But then again,

26:44.260 --> 26:46.380
the tests they ran on the rat

26:46.390 --> 26:48.460
helped them get closer to finding answers.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.340
The rat didn't have a choice in the matter,

26:51.350 --> 26:52.740
so why should I?

26:53.420 --> 26:55.200
I mean, I know there's people who don't approve

26:55.210 --> 26:56.680
of using the rat in the first place, but--

26:56.690 --> 26:59.530
Kyle, you're a teenaged boy.

26:59.950 --> 27:02.150
No one should be allowed to take your life away from you

27:02.160 --> 27:04.090
before you've had a chance to live it.

27:05.280 --> 27:08.260
But why is my life more important than the rats?

27:10.050 --> 27:12.090
Because you're the kind of person

27:12.100 --> 27:13.830
who thinks to ask that question.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.840
There should be laws against people like her.

27:26.070 --> 27:28.780
Pretty in the face, dark in the soul.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.910
Please! She's not that pretty.

27:35.730 --> 27:37.170
Okay, she's kinda pretty.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.280
Here she comes. Try not to drool.

27:42.310 --> 27:44.140
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

27:44.370 --> 27:45.840
So you made some new friends.

27:45.850 --> 27:48.330
Oh, yeah. Isn't it great?

27:50.230 --> 27:52.360
Are you going to Preston's party this weekend?

27:55.130 --> 27:56.470
Or didn't you know?

27:57.700 --> 27:59.720
I haven't really seen him, so...

27:59.940 --> 28:02.310
I can't imagine he wouldn't invite you.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.970
Whatever. Preston's parties are so yesterday.

28:05.450 --> 28:06.670
Really?

28:09.360 --> 28:12.740
I heard they were... "A-list" only.

28:15.790 --> 28:17.510
Well, see ya.

28:23.180 --> 28:24.940
She totally grossed you.

28:26.910 --> 28:28.810
"Are you going to Preston's party this weekend?"

28:29.250 --> 28:30.710
That's my line.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.640
I saw the tapes.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.640
And you're right.

28:41.650 --> 28:43.520
I--I don't know how to handle her.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.950
I know what you must think of me, but...

28:50.030 --> 28:53.700
I wanted to show you that I've come here in good faith.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.250
Where did you get this?

29:01.080 --> 29:03.860
The day you sold it at the pawn shop,

29:03.870 --> 29:05.390
I went and bought it back.

29:06.980 --> 29:08.930
I needed to keep it safe

29:08.940 --> 29:10.910
until you realized its importance.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.290
It's a Latnok ring.

29:14.510 --> 29:15.880
That's the symbol.

29:17.020 --> 29:19.010
But if this is the ring that Adam gave me...

29:21.090 --> 29:22.590
Whose ring is this?

29:22.940 --> 29:24.870
That's Ballantine's father's.

29:25.260 --> 29:26.740
He was a member as well.

29:27.220 --> 29:28.950
All the members received rings.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.700
It was a way of identifying one another

29:30.910 --> 29:32.710
and the location of their safe house.

29:33.550 --> 29:35.040
And you're a Latnok?

29:35.340 --> 29:36.660
Yes.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.910
I know that you think that I'm a bad guy,

29:41.380 --> 29:44.760
And I cannot deny that I've made some questionable decisions

29:45.680 --> 29:47.710
That may not have been in your best interest.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.260
But right now, my main concern is Jessi's behavior.

29:52.930 --> 29:54.670
You don't know anything about her.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.650
How would you describe Adam Baylin?

29:58.280 --> 30:01.070
Warm. Brilliant. Caring.

30:03.570 --> 30:05.770
Do you use those words to describe Kyle?

30:06.530 --> 30:08.030
Absolutely.

30:08.650 --> 30:12.880
See, Adam came by all of that just naturally.

30:13.220 --> 30:16.360
He had the kind of soul that people just instantly

30:16.370 --> 30:17.910
connected with.

30:18.620 --> 30:20.380
Sara, she was different.

30:20.630 --> 30:22.130
And Sara was...

30:22.260 --> 30:23.660
Jessi's mother.

30:24.950 --> 30:28.560
She was beautiful and brilliant and...

30:29.150 --> 30:32.890
Stubborn, impetuous, and volatile.

30:34.980 --> 30:36.930
Does it remind you of anybody that you know?

30:41.590 --> 30:43.550
You don't have to like me.

30:44.760 --> 30:48.510
But please, don't abandon Jessi.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.490
She deserves better.

30:51.910 --> 30:53.300
As did Sara.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.090
Illicit partying, daytime rebellion,

31:02.110 --> 31:04.960
fabulousness uncensored...

31:06.660 --> 31:09.130
Hey! Aren't you in enough trouble?

31:09.530 --> 31:11.590
I've cleaned 87 gym mats.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.770
I'm already in hell. Why stop now?

31:13.910 --> 31:15.200
Where's Andy?

31:15.210 --> 31:17.320
She's chosen this week to be responsible.

31:17.355 --> 31:19.280
Responsible during career days?

31:19.290 --> 31:21.360
She's a rebel, what can I tell you?

31:22.760 --> 31:25.540
Declan finally got that ankle of his fixed, huh?

31:25.570 --> 31:26.990
Well, well, well.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.340
Look at who the arthroscopic cat dragged in.

31:29.350 --> 31:32.080
Nice. Make fun of a disabled person.

31:32.150 --> 31:34.340
You hurt yourself fleeing from a villainous

31:34.350 --> 31:35.630
mega-corporation.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.620
It's not exactly Helen Keller material.

31:37.710 --> 31:40.690
You could feel sorry for me losing a basketball scholarship.

31:40.700 --> 31:42.240
I've seen your house.

31:42.250 --> 31:43.830
Cry me a river, rich boy.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.030
All right.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.330
I hobbled my post-surgical self up here.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.520
What's the occasion?

31:48.530 --> 31:50.530
Well, everyone's all aflutter over Jessi,

31:50.540 --> 31:51.980
"The Mystery Jumper".

31:51.990 --> 31:53.630
Hence roof party.

31:53.850 --> 31:55.330
We're celebrating the fact

31:55.340 --> 31:57.260
That Jessi's a maladjusted attention seeker?

31:57.270 --> 31:57.970
No,

31:57.980 --> 32:00.270
we're just using it as an excuse to get out of career days.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.630
I'm all for an excuse to avoid the future,

32:02.640 --> 32:04.500
But are we doing about Jessi?

32:04.970 --> 32:06.860
Kyle's adopted a hands-off policy.

32:07.220 --> 32:09.660
He thinks she'll learn her lesson on her own.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.880
I hope he's right.

32:12.010 --> 32:13.830
I've got the battle scars from keeping his identity a

32:13.840 --> 32:15.000
secret.

32:15.030 --> 32:16.200
I'm not gonna be so psyched

32:16.210 --> 32:18.260
If Jessi's stunts start making headlines.

32:19.490 --> 32:21.010
Hey, there's "The Mystery Jumper".

32:21.240 --> 32:22.930
Oh, great.

32:22.940 --> 32:26.060
It's Jessi! Ready to wow us with another trick?

32:27.330 --> 32:28.930
I don't do tricks.

32:29.340 --> 32:30.960
Come on. Here's your chance.

32:30.970 --> 32:32.080
Show everyone what you can do.

32:32.090 --> 32:34.940
Don't encourage her. She's a poser.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.120
I'm not a poser.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.830
Right! Sorry.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.680
You're a superhero... in schoolgirl's clothing.

32:41.690 --> 32:43.260
Don't make fun of me.

32:43.310 --> 32:45.020
Hils, give it a rest.

32:46.240 --> 32:47.720
Why are you sticking up for me?

32:47.730 --> 32:48.830
You don't even like me.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.870
- Gee, I wonder why.
- Trager!

32:51.460 --> 32:53.790
Now, let's hear all the dirty laundry.

32:54.310 --> 32:55.780
You can't be an attention whore

32:55.790 --> 32:57.540
and protect your privacy.

32:58.300 --> 33:01.030
Batgirl over here was the one who beat up Lori.

33:01.970 --> 33:03.040
That--that wasn't me.

33:03.050 --> 33:04.250
The hell it wasn't!

33:04.260 --> 33:06.550
No, I mean-- I'm not like that anymore.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.870
Of course not, because now you're "The Mystery Jumper."

33:09.880 --> 33:11.310
I did jump.

33:11.320 --> 33:14.190
- Total illusion.
- Hils, stop.

33:14.450 --> 33:16.220
Lori, she hurt you.

33:16.570 --> 33:19.120
And now I'm gonna expose her for who she really is.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.940
I really don't think that's--

33:20.950 --> 33:23.380
Fine. I'll do it.

33:24.910 --> 33:26.230
This is not gonna end well.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.620
Bad idea, Jessi.

33:27.880 --> 33:28.980
Why?

33:28.990 --> 33:31.190
Everybody wants to see how I did it.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.110
I'll show you.

33:33.310 --> 33:35.050
No tricks, no wires.

33:35.550 --> 33:36.900
Get Kyle up here now.

33:53.530 --> 33:54.900
Jessi, don't do it.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.160
I've done it before. don't worry about it.

34:00.230 --> 34:01.020
You getting this?

34:01.030 --> 34:03.190
- We're rolling.
- Right, then.

34:10.949 --> 34:12.100
Wait.

34:15.340 --> 34:16.580
What are you doing?

34:16.659 --> 34:18.000
I'm jumping, too.

34:18.260 --> 34:19.590
Kyle, go away!

34:19.600 --> 34:21.340
I wanna show them ho easy it is.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.550
- It isn't.
- You can do it.

34:24.420 --> 34:25.900
Because I'm special.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.210
How special are you if I can do it, too?

34:31.920 --> 34:34.510
Fine. Do it with me.

34:36.889 --> 34:38.290
I'm gonna jump, too.

34:38.580 --> 34:40.540
- What?
- You can't.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.370
I'll beat you down there.

34:42.409 --> 34:44.070
No. It's unsafe. You'll get hurt,

34:44.080 --> 34:45.270
Then stop.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.020
I know how to do this.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.300
You're ruining it.

34:50.070 --> 34:51.739
Back off and let me go.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.100
Kyle--

35:01.110 --> 35:02.650
This is Jessi's moment.

35:25.190 --> 35:26.580
Thought so!

35:26.690 --> 35:28.480
You got all that, didn't you?

35:28.580 --> 35:30.540
Every last humiliating bit.

35:34.670 --> 35:37.010
I guess she did need all the ropes and wires.

35:46.340 --> 35:49.110
Another fraud exposed.

35:53.170 --> 35:54.350
How'd you do it?

35:54.470 --> 35:55.550
Do what?

35:55.560 --> 35:56.520
She jumped.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.020
The only way out was down.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.590
But she didn't fall.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.850
I saw your face. I know you did something.

36:07.260 --> 36:10.380
The human body is more than 50% water.

36:12.430 --> 36:13.590
And?

36:15.400 --> 36:16.700
That's it.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.740
I--I don't get it.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.460
Study up on your science.

36:20.590 --> 36:21.950
You'll figure it out.

36:57.860 --> 36:59.090
Hi.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.580
Hi.

37:18.630 --> 37:19.860
I'm sorry.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.370
I didn't mean to make you look bad in front of everyone.

37:29.260 --> 37:30.920
They all laughed at me.

37:38.830 --> 37:40.340
I didn't want you to jump.

37:44.370 --> 37:46.210
I didn't want to jump either.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.150
So why did you?

37:54.420 --> 37:57.020
I felt like I was losing their approval.

37:59.550 --> 38:00.840
And...

38:01.840 --> 38:04.460
I didn't want to go back to how I was before.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.530
What were you before?

38:11.050 --> 38:12.320
Invisible.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.320
Jessi,

38:17.660 --> 38:19.460
you were never invisible to me.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.600
Because you know my secret. You know that I'm special.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.310
Yes...

38:28.160 --> 38:29.510
You are.

38:30.440 --> 38:31.820
You're smart...

38:32.480 --> 38:34.360
And adventurous and creative.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.480
And you don't need to do tricks for people to see that.

38:40.060 --> 38:41.910
And what if I don't even see it?

38:47.280 --> 38:49.980
If there's one thing I've learned about life,

38:50.760 --> 38:53.590
From being here at this school and with my family,

38:55.670 --> 38:57.190
It's that the people with the most to offer

38:57.200 --> 38:59.210
Usually believe in themselves the least.

39:01.220 --> 39:02.480
You don't.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.340
Cause I have people that believe in me.

39:11.010 --> 39:12.940
So will you if you let them.

39:17.650 --> 39:18.760
You gotta give it to her.

39:18.770 --> 39:21.080
Career days a lot more interesting with Jessi around.

39:21.140 --> 39:23.760
I still vote for shoving her back into the pod.

39:23.770 --> 39:26.340
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

39:26.350 --> 39:27.530
What's up with you?

39:27.540 --> 39:29.690
The woman over there from the local cable station?

39:29.700 --> 39:30.990
She saw my blog.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.350
She said I pop on camera!

39:33.360 --> 39:36.500
And she offered me an internship.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.220
Hillary, that is fabulous!

39:39.430 --> 39:41.240
Now there'll be no living with you.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.590
Back to basics, huh?

39:47.890 --> 39:49.790
Enjoy it while it lasts.

39:49.900 --> 39:51.020
I do.

39:51.030 --> 39:53.450
I thought I made it clear that this fair

39:53.460 --> 39:55.020
is intended only for those students

39:55.030 --> 39:56.780
who are serious about their future.

39:56.790 --> 39:58.630
- Do you know what?
- I got this.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.270
I am serious, Mr. Hooper.

40:01.540 --> 40:02.860
Maybe you're right about me.

40:02.870 --> 40:05.240
Maybe I am lazy, and I lack study skills,

40:06.060 --> 40:07.350
but I've changed,

40:07.610 --> 40:09.660
and I'm gonna do something important with my life

40:09.670 --> 40:11.170
and make a difference.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.610
Well,

40:14.130 --> 40:15.620
that's all I wanted to hear.

40:20.260 --> 40:22.240
That's some serious gumption.

40:22.970 --> 40:24.370
Is that a good thing?

40:24.410 --> 40:25.850
What got into to?

40:26.990 --> 40:28.470
I made the decision.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.130
I chose a career.

40:30.300 --> 40:31.730
And?

40:32.250 --> 40:34.070
Call me dr. Trager.

40:34.820 --> 40:36.440
Really?

40:36.720 --> 40:38.060
Yeah.

40:38.550 --> 40:40.130
I wanna be the one to save you.

40:42.780 --> 40:45.890
Josh, you realize you're looking at, like,

40:45.900 --> 40:48.270
Ten more years of school before you actually become a

40:48.280 --> 40:49.570
doctor.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.470
Then I guess you're gonna have to stick around for quite a

40:52.480 --> 40:53.660
while.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.910
The future was still wide open,

41:08.380 --> 41:10.830
and my choices still seemed limitless.

41:12.270 --> 41:15.020
I knew that someday I might need to use my abilities more

41:15.030 --> 41:15.720
openly,

41:15.730 --> 41:17.170
as I had done to help Jessi,

41:18.400 --> 41:20.590
and that my gifts might invite attention.

41:26.690 --> 41:29.220
But for now, I just felt lucky and content,

41:30.150 --> 41:32.120
Because I could let my gifts evolve

41:32.130 --> 41:34.210
while I enjoyed the comfort of my home and family.

41:35.750 --> 41:37.230
Oh, hi, Mrs. Bloom.

41:38.780 --> 41:40.230
Another beautiful day.

41:41.520 --> 41:42.810
Isn't it?

41:45.120 --> 41:46.500
No worries.

42:04.350 --> 42:05.830
Decide to call it a night?

42:07.120 --> 42:08.360
I'm pretty tired.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.030
So how was school today?

42:15.480 --> 42:16.710
It turned out okay.

42:17.540 --> 42:20.230
You learn anything interesting?

42:23.450 --> 42:26.030
I learned the most important thing is to be myself.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.800
That's, uh...

42:30.650 --> 42:32.040
That's a good lesson.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.300
Sleep well.

42:44.670 --> 42:45.890
Jessi.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.270
I'm glad you're here.

42:49.830 --> 42:51.240
See you in the morning.

42:51.620 --> 42:53.100
All right. good night.
