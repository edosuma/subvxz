00:00.113 --> 00:01.704
(announcer) Previously on "Hunters"...

00:01.705 --> 00:03.155
(Jackson) Agent Regan was taken.

00:03.172 --> 00:04.883
Agent Briggs, you wrote that Agent Regan

00:04.884 --> 00:07.335
appeared to be a willing passenger
in Musa's helicopter.

00:07.337 --> 00:07.922
Yes, ma'am.

00:08.022 --> 00:09.490
I know you killed my parents.

00:09.590 --> 00:10.910
Is that what the humans told you?

00:10.924 --> 00:11.992
Are they still alive?

00:12.093 --> 00:14.061
The ETUs know more than I do.

00:14.161 --> 00:17.097
Hunters have been seeking
access to lithium mines in Romania

00:17.198 --> 00:18.933
from as far back as 1989.

00:19.033 --> 00:21.502
Raw materials for thermonuclear weapons.

00:21.602 --> 00:23.738
- (straining)
- She'll be ready for the Purge.

00:23.838 --> 00:25.740
Your mom and dad aren't
your real family.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.108
They were assigned to you.

00:27.207 --> 00:28.942
Like you to Flynn?

00:29.042 --> 00:31.411
They said I'd gone
native, but I refused to come in.

00:31.512 --> 00:32.847
Even if it meant being someone

00:32.947 --> 00:36.083
I never really was, I wanted you more.

00:36.183 --> 00:37.618
They need to think that I put up a fight

00:37.717 --> 00:38.852
and that's how you escaped.

00:38.953 --> 00:39.954
Shoot me.

00:40.054 --> 00:41.088
- Do it!
- (gunshot)

00:41.188 --> 00:42.089
Regan's not the mole.

00:42.189 --> 00:43.557
Jules ran the diagnostic.

00:43.656 --> 00:44.924
Told her she made the calls to McCarthy.

00:45.024 --> 00:47.293
And he knew about talking on Columbia.

00:47.393 --> 00:50.530
<i>Good luck finding somebody
else to spy on citizens for you</i>

00:50.631 --> 00:53.933
<i>and order drone strikes for
you and torture people for you.</i>

00:54.033 --> 00:56.103
(creature clicking and shrieking)

00:56.203 --> 00:58.339
There's just one
more thing you need to do.

01:02.008 --> 01:03.277
What happened?

01:03.376 --> 01:04.711
I got away.

01:07.013 --> 01:10.850
(panting)

01:15.989 --> 01:17.265

01:45.852 --> 01:47.787
(Emme) Flynn, are you awake?

01:47.888 --> 01:49.423
Yeah. I'm awake.

01:49.522 --> 01:51.125
(door opens)

01:52.725 --> 01:54.427
We have to leave in 12 minutes.

01:54.528 --> 01:55.629
I know.

01:55.728 --> 01:56.697
(panting)

01:56.796 --> 01:59.132
Are you okay?

01:59.233 --> 02:01.168
I'm fine.

02:01.268 --> 02:03.403
Why are you breathing so hard?

02:03.504 --> 02:07.341
I'm fine.

02:07.441 --> 02:08.776
Let me get dressed.

02:09.975 --> 02:11.344
Hey.

02:11.444 --> 02:12.564
Will you put on some coffee?

02:12.613 --> 02:15.248
Sure.

02:35.836 --> 02:38.038
<i>(lock beeps)</i>

02:44.911 --> 02:49.082
Finnerman thinks you
went with Musa willingly.

02:49.182 --> 02:50.450
She would think that.

02:52.384 --> 02:54.655
- Agent Regan...
- What?

02:54.754 --> 02:56.689
No Alison anymore?

02:58.258 --> 03:00.361
I'm going to need to
know everything that happened

03:00.461 --> 03:03.230
during your captivity, and
I mean every last detail.

03:03.330 --> 03:05.599
I'm not gonna tell you
shit until you tell me the truth

03:05.699 --> 03:08.669
about what
happened to my parents... sir.

03:08.769 --> 03:10.004
Your parents?

03:10.104 --> 03:11.772
What did you do with my mom and dad?

03:11.871 --> 03:13.606
Oh, nothing.

03:13.706 --> 03:16.576
Who told you we had anything
to do with them?

03:16.676 --> 03:17.710
Musa.

03:17.811 --> 03:19.113
Well, he's lying.

03:19.212 --> 03:21.948
You saw the Quins capture them.

03:22.049 --> 03:23.284
If Musa had my parents,

03:23.383 --> 03:26.252
he would have used
them to try and turn me.

03:26.353 --> 03:30.858
Regan, I honestly don't know
what happened to your parents.

03:35.061 --> 03:37.463
Musa might be a monster,

03:37.563 --> 03:40.000
but at least he told me the truth.

03:42.902 --> 03:48.908
(piano music playing)

04:05.425 --> 04:08.094
(music stops)

04:15.968 --> 04:17.937
(man) Okay, bring her in.

04:18.038 --> 04:20.038
That's it, okay, a little more.

04:23.108 --> 04:24.644
This place is impressive.

04:24.745 --> 04:26.447
Looks like things are
really getting organized.

04:26.547 --> 04:29.817
I heard things got gnarly at
the old hospital in Circleton.

04:29.916 --> 04:31.150
We got most our gear out

04:31.250 --> 04:33.920
before the ETU raided
us, but it was close.

04:34.021 --> 04:35.701
Jules didn't exactly
give us a lot of time.

04:35.755 --> 04:39.425
There was no leak from outside?

04:40.894 --> 04:42.930
No, we were never breached.

04:43.029 --> 04:44.530
ETU must have caught a break.

04:44.630 --> 04:46.766
They're nipping at our heels

04:46.867 --> 04:49.870
and now we've got no one on the inside.

04:49.970 --> 04:51.338
He was eliminated, wasn't he?

04:51.437 --> 04:54.140
Yeah, Jules was taken in the Great Hunt.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.209
Good.

04:55.309 --> 04:57.344
He'd served his purpose.

04:57.444 --> 04:59.680
We're moving ahead with it, then?

04:59.779 --> 05:01.381
Everything's on schedule.

05:01.482 --> 05:05.286
The Purge will take
place exactly as planned.

(Ted) If you're reading this, it

05:42.288 --> 05:45.558
You're on your own now and
you have to be strong.

05:45.658 --> 05:47.528
This is what we are.

05:47.627 --> 05:49.930
Ones we can't trust, they're here.

05:50.029 --> 05:52.665
- Come on.
- (loud explosion)

05:52.766 --> 05:54.867
(Ted) No matter what you
do, I am your father.

05:54.968 --> 05:56.870
(rabbit squeaks)

05:56.970 --> 05:58.238
And you're my little girl.

05:59.572 --> 06:00.985
(girls screams)

06:01.422 --> 06:02.643
And I'll always love you.

06:05.077 --> 06:07.013
(Flynn) Hey.

06:07.113 --> 06:08.614
Hey.

06:08.714 --> 06:10.516
I heard you saw Abby.

06:10.617 --> 06:11.652
Is she all right?

06:11.752 --> 06:14.687
I'm okay. Thanks for asking.

06:14.788 --> 06:15.956
Sorry.

06:16.055 --> 06:18.858
I'm glad you're back, really.

06:18.959 --> 06:20.194
Yeah, I saw Abby.

06:20.293 --> 06:22.161
(whispers) Did you talk with her?

06:29.235 --> 06:32.939
She tried to brainwash me.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.108
Called it deprogramming.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.576
Deprogramming from what.

06:36.677 --> 06:37.944
Human life.

06:39.345 --> 06:42.116
Abby told me they did
the same thing to her,

06:42.216 --> 06:45.619
probably why they got
her to try and turn me.

06:45.718 --> 06:47.988
Didn't work.

06:48.088 --> 06:49.256
You came back.

06:49.355 --> 06:51.492
And Abby did not.

06:51.591 --> 06:53.359
I guess it worked on her.

06:55.427 --> 06:57.363
She let me escape.

06:59.432 --> 07:02.235
Why would she do that?

07:02.336 --> 07:05.605
Don't know.

07:05.706 --> 07:08.942
Maybe they didn't want me.

07:09.041 --> 07:12.812
Are we responsible for
Regan's parents' disappearance?

07:12.913 --> 07:15.816
That's just Musa manipulating her.

07:15.915 --> 07:17.317
Regan was on the inside.

07:17.416 --> 07:19.619
She had direct contact with Musa.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.255
She has vital intel,

07:21.355 --> 07:23.424
intel we have no other
means of acquiring.

07:23.524 --> 07:24.690
Well, if she's refusing to talk,

07:24.790 --> 07:26.692
we do have options.

07:26.793 --> 07:29.062
Put her in the chair?

07:29.080 --> 07:30.097
Use her own treatment against...

07:30.197 --> 07:31.331
The Hunters are mining

07:31.430 --> 07:33.166
raw materials for WMDs

07:33.266 --> 07:37.504
and you're concerned
about her discomfort.

07:37.603 --> 07:39.539
We will do whatever it takes.

07:39.639 --> 07:41.175
She will cooperate.

07:41.274 --> 07:42.875
Only if we give her what she demands.

07:42.975 --> 07:44.177
That's not unreasonable.

07:44.278 --> 07:46.680
If you know anything
about Regan's parents,

07:46.779 --> 07:48.347
now would be the time to tell me.

07:49.797 --> 07:51.685
(Liana) We've shut
down the breeding camp

07:51.785 --> 07:52.953
and the Columbian operation.

07:53.052 --> 07:54.954
All other loose ends need to be tied.

07:55.055 --> 07:56.490
There's nothing else outstanding.

07:56.589 --> 07:58.357
Except Regan.

07:58.458 --> 08:01.462
The reprogramming was unsuccessful.

08:01.562 --> 08:03.564
Hers or yours?

08:03.663 --> 08:04.664
You failed.

08:04.764 --> 08:06.065
She spent so long as a human.

08:06.165 --> 08:07.867
You failed.

08:07.968 --> 08:09.136
Where is she now?

08:10.569 --> 08:12.009
Let me answer that question for you.

08:12.072 --> 08:14.074
She's back with the ETU.

08:14.173 --> 08:17.076
Full of information about
us, spilling everything.

08:17.177 --> 08:20.080
You're in charge of her during the Hunt.

08:20.180 --> 08:22.081
Alison ran off before the kill.

08:22.182 --> 08:23.717
Alison? Why would she do that?

08:23.817 --> 08:25.218
I guess she got spooked.

08:25.319 --> 08:27.754
You lost a Seraphin to
the ETU, now Regan.

08:27.853 --> 08:30.089
Despite this, Musa still
seems to think you're an asset.

08:30.189 --> 08:31.090
But I beg to differ.

08:31.190 --> 08:33.826
(creature shrieking)

08:37.363 --> 08:39.332
- (gurgling)
- He's dying.

08:39.433 --> 08:40.734
It's the reversion process.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.568
The shell hasn't taken.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.071
(shrieks)

08:51.276 --> 08:52.845
It isn't working.

08:52.945 --> 08:56.649
(groans)

08:59.452 --> 09:01.488
(clicking)

09:02.521 --> 09:03.589
(clicks)

09:06.391 --> 09:07.761
(clicking)

09:17.203 --> 09:19.606
Stuck between Hunter and human.

09:21.641 --> 09:23.477
(clicking)

09:23.577 --> 09:25.746
Shh...

09:25.845 --> 09:26.779
(bones crack)

09:29.114 --> 09:31.751
(bones crack)

09:31.852 --> 09:32.920
It's the only way.

09:40.492 --> 09:43.629
(jump rope snapping)

09:50.270 --> 09:51.805
Regan.

09:52.537 --> 09:55.808
Regan.

10:01.213 --> 10:04.584
Before I say anything, I need to
know you're gonna talk to me.

10:04.685 --> 10:06.286
Holding out is just
gonna make things worse.

10:06.386 --> 10:07.654
Worse than you lying to me?

10:07.753 --> 10:10.257
Are you gonna cooperate?

10:13.026 --> 10:14.861
Guanos are after a human.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.095
Sterling Martinez.

10:16.195 --> 10:17.997
Lives in Baltimore.

10:18.098 --> 10:20.132
Don't know why they want him.

10:20.233 --> 10:22.868
It has to do with
something they called the Purge.

10:22.968 --> 10:24.438
Sounds ominous.

10:24.537 --> 10:26.038
Your turn.

10:26.138 --> 10:29.609
I don't know
anything about your mother...

10:34.046 --> 10:36.516
But your father, we have him.

10:36.616 --> 10:39.151
You have him?

10:39.252 --> 10:40.554
What does that mean?

10:40.654 --> 10:43.557
Finnerman has him at a secure facility.

10:43.656 --> 10:44.858
For how long?

10:45.858 --> 10:47.627
How long?!

10:47.728 --> 10:51.564
He hasn't been at that
site for long, but altogether,

10:51.665 --> 10:53.533
he's been held for six years.

10:53.632 --> 10:55.368
(snarls)

10:57.203 --> 10:58.838
I'm sorry.

10:58.939 --> 10:59.973
(grunts)

11:03.075 --> 11:04.143
I want to see my father.

11:16.114 --> 11:18.484
You deceived me, Ruth.

11:18.584 --> 11:21.888
Agent Regan is our best asset, or was.

11:21.988 --> 11:23.689
I don't know if
she'll ever trust me again.

11:23.790 --> 11:25.791
<i>(Finnerman) You and I
go back three decades.</i>

11:25.891 --> 11:27.994
There is no one I trust more.

11:28.094 --> 11:29.795
Which is precisely
why I didn't tell you.

11:29.896 --> 11:31.198
To protect you.

11:31.297 --> 11:33.799
Protecting me does not help Agent Regan.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.002
(lock beeps)

11:36.103 --> 11:38.204
She's in a very vulnerable state.

11:38.305 --> 11:40.473
<i>If Agent Regan is
medically unfit for work,</i>

11:40.574 --> 11:43.242
she will need to
provide a report to that effect.

11:43.343 --> 11:45.312
<i>She gave us what we wanted.</i>

11:45.411 --> 11:46.879
Now it's our turn.

11:46.979 --> 11:48.014
<i>Once Flynn and Briggs</i>

11:48.114 --> 11:49.682
have found this Martinez

11:49.782 --> 11:51.742
and we can establish
that the intel is legitimate,

11:51.752 --> 11:53.819
then we can move on Regan's request.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.222
<i>No. I'm not lying to Regan.</i>

11:55.321 --> 11:57.023
I made a deal with her.

11:57.123 --> 11:59.258
She will see her
father without waiting on

11:59.358 --> 12:01.228
what happens to Martinez.

12:01.328 --> 12:03.329
Matter of fact, I'll take her myself.

12:03.817 --> 12:05.697
(Jackson) All right, we
gotta move fast on this.

12:05.785 --> 12:09.355
Sterling Martinez, 37.

12:09.456 --> 12:12.259
Martinez is a former
scientist with Wexxler-Kline,

12:12.359 --> 12:13.860
a Belgian pharmaceutical.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.965
As far as we can tell, he
retired early, aged 30.

12:18.065 --> 12:19.733
Big time farmer.

12:19.832 --> 12:21.901
Probably cashed in
after inventing a pill

12:22.001 --> 12:23.269
that makes modern life better.

12:23.370 --> 12:24.471
Oh, you'd know.

12:24.571 --> 12:27.274
Martinez appears to live modestly.

12:27.374 --> 12:30.777
Jules' replacement can
scour his financials to find out

12:30.876 --> 12:31.777
what he's been hiding.

12:31.878 --> 12:33.080
Stephanie Le Guin,

12:33.179 --> 12:35.481
meet Agent Briggs, Agent Carroll.

12:35.581 --> 12:36.783
The muscle.

12:36.883 --> 12:38.251
Oh, Miss Congeniality.

12:38.351 --> 12:39.711
(Jackson) Steph's a cryptographer,

12:39.785 --> 12:41.654
Finnerman brought her
in to continue working on

12:41.754 --> 12:43.090
decoding the Hunter language.

12:43.190 --> 12:46.460
The Hunters have their eyes on Martinez.

12:46.559 --> 12:48.160
This is coming from Regan.

12:48.260 --> 12:49.596
How do we know it's not compromised?

12:49.696 --> 12:51.565
We don't.

12:51.664 --> 12:55.134
This is where he's
holed up, Fells Point.

12:55.235 --> 12:58.672
Musa is casting a line.

12:58.772 --> 13:00.774
Let's reel Martinez in first.

13:00.874 --> 13:04.076
We've tried everything to
make the process work.

13:04.177 --> 13:08.348
Without the
reversion, there is no Purge.

13:08.447 --> 13:10.483
Losing the Coahuila cell set us back.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.103
Ted alone cost us a decade of research

13:12.184 --> 13:14.487
and then McCarthy and his antics.

13:14.587 --> 13:16.490
Maybe it's time you bring in the human.

13:16.590 --> 13:17.691
We rely on them too much as it is.

13:17.791 --> 13:19.292
But he's made a breakthrough.

13:19.392 --> 13:20.694
And we have no other options.

13:20.793 --> 13:23.496
Abby's right. Bring in Martinez.

13:23.596 --> 13:25.831
I can't. I have to meet with Karp.

13:25.932 --> 13:26.932
He'll only deal with me.

13:27.033 --> 13:27.933
I'll go.

13:28.033 --> 13:29.436
No, definitely not.

13:29.535 --> 13:30.503
I've already been in touch with him.

13:30.604 --> 13:31.504
I can handle it.

13:31.605 --> 13:32.765
As well as you handled Regan?

13:33.739 --> 13:34.941
Abby can take care of it.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.777
Thank you, Musa.

13:48.053 --> 13:49.523
Do not disappoint me.

13:49.623 --> 13:51.625
I won't.

13:52.892 --> 13:54.427
The Feelers will go with you.

13:54.528 --> 13:56.495
(creature clicking)

13:56.596 --> 13:57.596
Go.

13:58.563 --> 13:59.832
(clicking)

14:03.769 --> 14:06.005
(creature chirps and clicks)

14:37.035 --> 14:38.704
(Briggs) All clear.

14:40.539 --> 14:42.976
(Flynn) Looks like
Martinez didn't retire after all.

14:44.744 --> 14:48.715
(Briggs) No, he took up
fishing or he's opening a Red Lobster.

14:48.815 --> 14:50.750
No, he's studying this stuff.

15:02.260 --> 15:07.067
Carroll, take a look at this.

15:11.504 --> 15:12.938
Quins.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.307
He's working for the Hunters.

15:15.408 --> 15:17.409
(Briggs) These are dated ten years ago.

15:17.509 --> 15:19.629
If they are baby Quins, then
they're all grown up now.

15:19.645 --> 15:21.280
That's a comforting thought.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.115
Lots of stuff on a bone disease

15:23.216 --> 15:25.485
called craniodiaphyseal dysplasia.

15:25.585 --> 15:30.490
Says here it causes bone
defects in the skull and face.

15:30.590 --> 15:33.293
Well, what do aliens
care about a calcium disorder?

15:33.393 --> 15:35.461
Mm-hmm.

15:35.562 --> 15:36.495
The hell are you doing?

15:36.596 --> 15:37.964
Collecting evidence.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.498
Don't pull that shit.

15:39.599 --> 15:42.636
How you gonna watch my
back if you're tweaked?

15:42.735 --> 15:44.069
- I'm not tweaked.
- No, not yet, maybe.

15:44.169 --> 15:45.471
It's for the pain.

15:45.572 --> 15:48.174
My legs have been
screwed since the prison raid.

15:48.274 --> 15:50.442
Not your leg. Try your head.

15:50.543 --> 15:51.845
If you can't handle this...

15:51.945 --> 15:52.846
I can handle it just fine.

15:52.946 --> 15:53.980
(door creaks opens)

15:56.381 --> 15:58.284
Sterling Martinez!

15:58.384 --> 15:59.485
Please don't shoot me.

16:19.938 --> 16:21.640
(inhales sharply)

16:28.313 --> 16:29.949
(lock beeping)

16:47.700 --> 16:52.272
Just take it one step at a time.

16:58.043 --> 17:00.480
I'll be close by if you need me.

17:05.251 --> 17:08.655
(Regan) Dad?

17:10.255 --> 17:11.992
(clicking)

17:30.889 --> 17:32.191
Alison.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.430
(gasps)

17:38.531 --> 17:40.532
Look at you all grown up.

17:43.168 --> 17:44.570
Your hands, scars.

17:44.671 --> 17:46.606
Who did this to you?

17:46.705 --> 17:49.141
It's okay, it's okay, I'm not in pain.

17:49.242 --> 17:50.944
At least it stopped me from molting.

17:51.043 --> 17:52.478
I don't miss that.

17:52.579 --> 17:54.013
(whimpers)

17:56.281 --> 17:58.083
<i>Where's Mom? Is she here, too?</i>

17:59.652 --> 18:02.889
No.

18:02.989 --> 18:04.391
I don't know where she is.

18:04.491 --> 18:07.594
I haven't see her in years.

18:08.527 --> 18:09.729
I can't believe it's you.

18:09.829 --> 18:11.063
It's me.

18:11.164 --> 18:12.604
I didn't think you were still alive.

18:15.134 --> 18:17.637
How'd they catch you?

18:21.540 --> 18:24.511
I'm not a prisoner.

18:24.610 --> 18:26.278
I work for them.

18:32.318 --> 18:34.186
Look at what they're capable of.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.189
I didn't know this place existed.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.625
Hunters were killing people.

18:38.724 --> 18:40.426
That's what I wanted to stop.

18:40.527 --> 18:43.396
There's a lot you don't know.

18:45.464 --> 18:47.666
Who are these kids? What's
wrong with them?

18:47.767 --> 18:51.805
They were born with a
rare sclerotic bone disorder,

18:51.905 --> 18:55.008
severe calcium buildup in the skull.

18:55.108 --> 18:56.810
So they're human.

18:56.909 --> 18:58.143
I don't understand.

18:58.243 --> 19:02.448
He doesn't know.

19:02.549 --> 19:05.285
You have a homemade lab.

19:05.385 --> 19:06.720
You're conducting experiments.

19:06.819 --> 19:09.021
Well, maybe you're cooking drugs.

19:09.121 --> 19:11.590
Or bombs or worse.

19:11.691 --> 19:14.361
No, no, it's just... it's just research.

19:14.461 --> 19:16.829
I work for a pharmaceutical company.

19:16.929 --> 19:19.465
We did a critical trial of a new drug.

19:19.566 --> 19:21.901
There were some side effects.

19:22.001 --> 19:24.904
They didn't show up until
some patients had children.

19:25.003 --> 19:26.973
You caused birth defects.

19:27.072 --> 19:30.275
Yeah, we did.

19:30.376 --> 19:33.646
Hundreds of kids.

19:33.745 --> 19:35.464
I took full responsibility.

19:35.743 --> 19:37.983
I mean, that's why I
retired early, to try and help them.

19:38.083 --> 19:39.485
I wanted to fix this.

19:39.586 --> 19:41.755
That's what my research is about.

19:41.855 --> 19:44.357
I just made what I think might
be a huge breakthrough.

19:44.456 --> 19:47.593
I'm meeting with some
new investors this afternoon.

19:47.694 --> 19:50.363
My last memory of you and Mom

19:50.463 --> 19:52.965
is both of you being taken by the Quins.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.067
Quins?

19:54.166 --> 19:55.734
Never heard that before.

19:55.835 --> 19:57.069
The deformed Hunters.

19:57.169 --> 19:59.505
The ones who attacked our house.

19:59.606 --> 20:01.875
We call them Feelers.

20:01.974 --> 20:04.711
They're Brother's
servants, like his bloodhounds.

20:04.810 --> 20:06.413
Very dangerous.

20:06.512 --> 20:08.947
How did you end up in
here if Musa took you?

20:11.050 --> 20:12.185
You know Musa?

20:12.284 --> 20:13.386
Brother number four.

20:13.485 --> 20:15.621
We've met.

20:15.722 --> 20:17.557
I know he's the leader of the Hunters.

20:17.656 --> 20:21.093
Musa and I... we had a falling out.

20:21.194 --> 20:25.764
Musa was becoming extreme in
his measures and I disagreed.

20:25.865 --> 20:29.536
My life was in danger, so I left.

20:29.636 --> 20:32.405
The humans caught me.

20:32.504 --> 20:35.641
Here I am.

20:35.742 --> 20:36.975
(groans)

20:37.076 --> 20:39.112
Finnerman did this to you?

20:39.212 --> 20:41.548
<i>So many over the years.</i>

20:41.647 --> 20:43.916
<i>Not just me, other Hunters, too.</i>

20:44.017 --> 20:45.618
<i>They're watching all of us.</i>

20:45.717 --> 20:48.220
<i>I can't really blame
them for the experiments.</i>

20:48.320 --> 20:52.224
<i>Humans are very curious, and
also easily frightened.</i>

20:52.325 --> 20:55.061
Quite nasty if you
don't answer their questions.

20:59.831 --> 21:03.802
Um...

21:03.903 --> 21:05.805
Was this man ever involved?

21:15.047 --> 21:16.415
<i>I've never seen him before.</i>

21:19.185 --> 21:22.288
A soldier brought me here.

21:22.387 --> 21:24.491
Polynesian looking, had an accent.

21:28.493 --> 21:30.362
This guy?

21:30.463 --> 21:32.432
The one on the left?

21:34.399 --> 21:37.503
He looks familiar, but I can't be sure.

21:37.604 --> 21:41.341
Someone reached out to me
after I posted my results online,

21:41.441 --> 21:42.775
but I never met them.

21:42.875 --> 21:45.478
(Briggs) Oh, you
didn't think that was weird?

21:45.578 --> 21:48.381
Random e-mail from a pharma exec?

21:48.481 --> 21:50.983
Well, I vetted the
credentials as best as I could.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.685
They're with a startup,
they seem well financed.

21:53.785 --> 21:56.321
- And what do they want from you?
- Well, my research.

21:56.422 --> 21:58.391
They have an interest in
skull and bone disorders.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.193
They're on their way here now.

22:00.292 --> 22:03.195
We need to roll, come on.

22:03.296 --> 22:04.998
- Excuse me?
- You're in danger,

22:05.098 --> 22:07.300
we're getting you out of here.

22:07.399 --> 22:09.201
Gather your research. All of it.

22:09.301 --> 22:10.703
There must be a
mistake, I'm just a retired...

22:10.802 --> 22:12.171
Get your shit, now.

22:12.271 --> 22:15.241
(cell phone vibrating)

22:15.340 --> 22:16.742
Flynn Carroll.

22:16.842 --> 22:20.646
<i>Flynn? It's me, Abby.</i>

22:20.746 --> 22:23.550
Hang on.

22:23.649 --> 22:25.752
<i>(Abby) I'm in trouble.
I don't know what to do.</i>

22:25.851 --> 22:28.053
Just... just slow
down. Start from the beginning.

22:28.154 --> 22:31.891
<i>Musa wants me to do
something, but I don't think I can do it.</i>

22:31.991 --> 22:33.926
What does he want you to do?

22:34.027 --> 22:36.930
<i>Kill an innocent
person, and if I don't do it,</i>

22:37.030 --> 22:40.066
<i>Musa will kill me.</i>

22:40.165 --> 22:41.667
What do you want from me?

22:41.768 --> 22:44.069
I need you to come get
me, but it has to be now.

22:55.644 --> 22:57.409
Abby doesn't want to turn herself in.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.518
This is her play.

22:58.617 --> 23:02.554
She's trying to lure you
away so she can snatch Martinez.

23:02.655 --> 23:05.925
She sounded scared.

23:06.024 --> 23:08.961
And Regan told me Abby let her escape.

23:09.061 --> 23:11.063
And you believe that B.S.?

23:11.164 --> 23:13.066
Man, we gotta strap you to the mast.

23:13.165 --> 23:16.069
She was my wife. This is my call.

23:16.168 --> 23:17.270
No.

23:17.369 --> 23:19.705
If Abby wants to come in, she will.

23:19.806 --> 23:21.241
With or without you.

23:21.340 --> 23:22.774
And if she doesn't,

23:22.875 --> 23:28.214
you're not gonna have the
guts to do a thing about it.

23:28.313 --> 23:32.117
Musa's planning something.

23:32.217 --> 23:34.486
I'm worried a lot of innocent
people are gonna die.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.289
There's innocents here, too.

23:36.388 --> 23:38.957
I've been locked away a long time.

23:39.058 --> 23:40.093
<i>Please...</i>

23:40.193 --> 23:41.493
How many people are held here?

23:41.594 --> 23:42.562
People?

23:42.662 --> 23:44.097
None.

23:44.196 --> 23:45.397
How many captives?

23:45.498 --> 23:48.434
Just the one.

23:51.749 --> 23:53.306
<i>(Regan) It would still be useful.</i>

23:53.406 --> 23:55.108
<i>(Ted) I don't know what to tell you.</i>

23:55.207 --> 23:56.942
Tell me about the Purge.

23:57.042 --> 23:59.311
Nothing you should concern
yourself with.

23:59.412 --> 24:01.247
Why are you still defending Musa?

24:01.347 --> 24:02.581
He tried to kill you.

24:08.020 --> 24:09.821
Your mother tried to kill me.

24:14.158 --> 24:17.362
She's Musa's right hand.

24:17.463 --> 24:19.932
She chose him over us.

24:20.031 --> 24:24.771
The night the... Quins came,

24:24.870 --> 24:27.406
your mother set us up to be captured.

24:30.742 --> 24:32.145
Why would she do that?

24:32.244 --> 24:36.482
'Cause Musa wanted me to
come in and I wouldn't.

24:36.581 --> 24:38.350
I was planning to
leave the Hunters for good,

24:38.451 --> 24:43.189
<i>give you a new
life, free from all the...</i>

24:43.289 --> 24:45.892
Detour in the south hall.

24:55.067 --> 24:57.670
<i>(Regan) Why didn't
Mom want to come with us?</i>

24:57.770 --> 25:00.006
<i>To keep our family together?</i>

25:00.106 --> 25:02.008
Your mother and I were playing roles.

25:04.175 --> 25:05.243
But I wasn't.

25:05.344 --> 25:07.013
I wasn't, not when it came to you.

25:09.281 --> 25:12.050
I'm your father, Alison.

25:12.150 --> 25:16.788
And nothing, not even
Musa, could ever change that.

25:18.357 --> 25:20.492
(cell phone vibrating)

25:29.967 --> 25:31.503
(Ted) You okay?

25:34.406 --> 25:35.407
You okay?

25:35.508 --> 25:37.242
Yeah.

25:37.775 --> 25:38.844
Yeah.

25:38.944 --> 25:40.012
(whispers) Something's going on.

25:40.111 --> 25:42.714
We need to create a diversion.

25:48.052 --> 25:49.621
- (groans)
- Dad?

25:49.722 --> 25:50.956
- (grunts)
- Dad?

25:51.057 --> 25:52.224
<i>Help us, someone, please!</i>

25:52.325 --> 25:54.360
<i>Help!</i>

25:54.460 --> 25:55.395
What's going on?

25:55.494 --> 25:56.428
(man) I don't know.

25:56.529 --> 25:57.530
<i>Someone please!</i>

25:57.629 --> 25:58.563
Help her!

25:58.664 --> 26:01.834
<i>Help him! Please!</i>

26:06.405 --> 26:08.307
(lock beeping)

26:08.406 --> 26:10.208
(Regan) Dad? Dad?

26:12.977 --> 26:18.216
(heavy metal music playing)

26:21.419 --> 26:24.122
(lock beeping)

26:25.357 --> 26:28.895
(music grows louder)

26:55.153 --> 26:56.489
(lock beeping)

26:58.523 --> 27:02.261
(heavy metal music playing)

27:17.809 --> 27:19.912
(music stops)

27:35.860 --> 27:37.062
McCarthy?

27:37.163 --> 27:39.531
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

27:39.631 --> 27:40.999
(McCarthy clicking)

27:47.973 --> 27:50.408
(groans)

27:56.548 --> 27:58.084
Has a doctor seen you?

27:58.184 --> 27:59.452
No, no, no, no, no, no...

27:59.551 --> 28:01.853
No doctors.

28:01.954 --> 28:03.822
(grunts)

28:03.923 --> 28:05.525
Just butchers.

28:05.625 --> 28:07.859
And of course, the
butcher queen herself.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.662
Finnerman?

28:09.762 --> 28:12.031
She never told you.

28:12.130 --> 28:14.466
Of course not.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.801
The stench of her indecency.

28:16.902 --> 28:18.704
(inhales deeply)

28:18.803 --> 28:20.473
(growls)

28:20.572 --> 28:23.175
Spare yourself, McCarthy, talk to us.

28:23.274 --> 28:24.877
I tried talking.

28:24.976 --> 28:27.112
Baseball, politics.

28:27.213 --> 28:28.548
Hell, we even played trivia.

28:28.647 --> 28:29.948
(chuckling)

28:30.049 --> 28:31.817
What do Nancy Sinatra, Freddie Mercury,

28:31.916 --> 28:33.785
and Brittany Spears all have in common?

28:33.886 --> 28:35.820
I don't know.

28:35.921 --> 28:38.357
You people turn their
music into a misery.

28:38.456 --> 28:40.025
Use it to torture prisoners.

28:40.126 --> 28:41.961
At least Iron Maiden made sense.

28:42.060 --> 28:43.029
You're a murderer, McCarthy.

28:43.128 --> 28:46.365
Then kill me.

28:46.464 --> 28:49.001
An eye for an eye.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.002
That's one of your
commandments, isn't it, Elder Jackson?

28:51.102 --> 28:53.705
My faith has nothing to do with this.

28:53.806 --> 28:57.043
Your faith has
everything to do with this.

29:01.612 --> 29:02.914
Please.

29:03.014 --> 29:04.983
We know about the Purge.

29:05.083 --> 29:06.952
Cooperate with us

29:07.052 --> 29:10.222
and I will make sure you
are treated humanely.

29:10.321 --> 29:12.724
Then Musa kills me for being a traitor.

29:12.825 --> 29:14.527
I will protect you from
Musa and everyone else,

29:14.627 --> 29:16.262
I give you my word.

29:16.361 --> 29:18.263
(coughs)

29:18.364 --> 29:21.701
(growls and chitters)

29:25.069 --> 29:27.339
Water, please.

29:29.073 --> 29:31.676
(panting)

29:31.777 --> 29:33.613
Christ on the cross asked for water.

29:33.713 --> 29:37.516
The least you could do is
give me a sponge soaked in vinegar.

29:43.254 --> 29:46.358
(Jackson) God forgive us.

29:54.433 --> 29:57.869
(McCarthy grunting)

30:06.444 --> 30:07.847
(clicking)

30:09.781 --> 30:12.251
Too good for your own good.

30:16.387 --> 30:17.522
(cries out)

30:18.156 --> 30:19.290
(grunts)

30:29.701 --> 30:31.737
(guns cocks)

30:33.804 --> 30:34.806
Hi, Flynn.

30:34.906 --> 30:37.643
Surprise.

30:37.742 --> 30:40.146
The famous Abby.

30:40.245 --> 30:42.113
You know, you're cute for a Guano.

30:42.214 --> 30:45.818
It's all over.

30:45.917 --> 30:49.221
(gunshots)

30:53.390 --> 30:55.492
And they say metal is dead.

30:58.562 --> 31:02.167
(heavy metal music plays)

31:03.068 --> 31:06.172
(alarm sounding)

31:10.242 --> 31:11.310
(clicking)

31:14.311 --> 31:16.281
You, head off
McCarthy, I'll get the doors!

31:16.381 --> 31:18.783
No! You stay!

31:20.085 --> 31:22.988
Let me out! Jackson!

31:26.925 --> 31:28.961
(roars)

31:29.060 --> 31:30.128
(cries out)

31:38.336 --> 31:40.339
(clicking)

31:52.216 --> 31:53.218
(lock beeping)

31:53.319 --> 31:55.354
Regan!

32:03.261 --> 32:06.165
(tires screeching)

32:07.065 --> 32:08.734
Shit.

32:10.969 --> 32:13.405
(Jackson) No. No.

32:34.059 --> 32:36.127
Come on.

32:36.227 --> 32:38.396
Stay with me. Stay with me.

32:46.637 --> 32:48.473
I want to see Flynn.

32:48.573 --> 32:50.975
You don't think you've
messed with him enough?

32:51.076 --> 32:53.078
Are you gonna kill me?

32:53.177 --> 32:54.218
That'd be no fun.

32:54.733 --> 32:56.281
Interrogation, on the other hand...

32:58.983 --> 33:00.886
Hey, pack it up. Let's go.

33:00.985 --> 33:02.153
You said clear it out.

33:02.253 --> 33:04.790
I don't want to
leave behind any research.

33:09.461 --> 33:12.431
(water slurping)

33:12.531 --> 33:15.067
What's wrong?

33:15.166 --> 33:16.801
Something's not right.

33:16.902 --> 33:20.506
(high pitch shriek)

33:21.606 --> 33:23.041
(both groan)

33:24.475 --> 33:28.414
- (high pitch shriek)
- (straining)

33:28.513 --> 33:32.083
(high pitch shriek continues)

33:42.627 --> 33:45.865
(cries out)

33:45.964 --> 33:47.165
(straining)

33:49.067 --> 33:51.270
(high pitch shriek continues)

33:59.543 --> 34:02.580
(shrieking stops)

34:32.377 --> 34:34.112
(high pitch shriek)

34:36.748 --> 34:41.020
(groans)

34:46.090 --> 34:48.594
Why the hell didn't you stop her?

35:02.720 --> 35:08.059
I can't do my job properly
if you keep things from me.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.196
You let our most prized asset get away.

35:11.296 --> 35:13.299
If it wouldn't raise
questions about my facility,

35:13.399 --> 35:15.615
you'd be out of a job right now.

35:16.032 --> 35:17.736
What the hell were you thinking?

35:17.836 --> 35:20.372
He was bleeding.

35:20.471 --> 35:22.240
He was coughing up blood.

35:22.341 --> 35:24.577
There were wounds all over him.

35:24.676 --> 35:26.578
It was immoral, it was dirty,

35:26.678 --> 35:28.446
and I don't want to
take any more part in it.

35:28.546 --> 35:32.283
McCarthy is a liar and a serial killer.

35:32.383 --> 35:34.719
He murdered his own offspring.

35:34.819 --> 35:36.788
And what about Regan's father?

35:36.888 --> 35:39.791
He clearly loves his
child, like a human.

35:39.892 --> 35:41.327
And he wasn't spared torture.

35:41.426 --> 35:44.930
Which is precisely
why I kept you out of it.

35:45.029 --> 35:47.265
I know your
limitations, Truss, believe me.

35:47.366 --> 35:49.396
Better than you do.

35:52.043 --> 35:54.005
Now, you're not gonna
go and do anything foolish

35:54.105 --> 35:55.240
like resign, are you?

35:55.339 --> 35:57.108
No.

35:57.209 --> 35:58.844
We have a job to do.

35:58.944 --> 36:00.613
Well, as long as you remain,

36:00.712 --> 36:02.814
I require your subordination

36:02.915 --> 36:05.250
and your discretion on this matter.

36:05.350 --> 36:08.252
You have it.

36:08.352 --> 36:10.121
As always.

36:10.221 --> 36:11.290
Good.

36:13.991 --> 36:15.928
Oh, and don't worry.

36:16.028 --> 36:17.629
I've made sure that the deaths

36:17.729 --> 36:21.866
of those young soldiers
today aren't on you.

36:21.966 --> 36:25.269
Not on paper, at least.

36:33.211 --> 36:34.812
(pill bottle clatters)

36:36.214 --> 36:38.517
Maybe if you weren't so doped up,

36:38.616 --> 36:40.486
we'd still have Martinez.

36:42.187 --> 36:44.455
And your sexy wife.

36:46.890 --> 36:51.629
I should have handled Abby, not you.

36:51.729 --> 36:53.898
Like you did at the hotel?

36:53.999 --> 36:55.334
I would have brought her in this time.

36:55.433 --> 36:56.868
Oh, bullshit.

36:56.968 --> 37:00.571
You just had your shot. You let her go.

37:00.671 --> 37:04.676
You still think she loves you.

37:04.776 --> 37:06.878
(scoffs)

37:06.979 --> 37:08.513
Oh, whatever's in that medication,

37:08.613 --> 37:11.015
that's some strong hooch.

37:12.716 --> 37:15.887
You don't know shit about me.

37:15.988 --> 37:18.723
You don't know shit about you.

37:24.529 --> 37:28.834
You know that scar on your arm?

37:28.933 --> 37:31.002
Jules had the same scar.

37:41.145 --> 37:43.314
So did other Hunter victims.

37:44.816 --> 37:46.452
Jackson didn't tell you?

37:46.551 --> 37:49.120
No.

37:49.220 --> 37:54.192
Man up and face your
demons, if you even can.

37:54.292 --> 37:55.259
(grunts)

38:21.185 --> 38:23.921
Guano should have killed
you when they had the chance.

38:31.529 --> 38:32.898
(shouts)

39:15.906 --> 39:17.508
I'm back, Musa.

39:25.049 --> 39:28.754
The humans held me
captive, but I escaped.

39:48.339 --> 39:50.509
I've warned you to stop
with the injections,

39:50.609 --> 39:53.645
the drug abusers.

39:53.745 --> 39:55.247
I did.

39:55.346 --> 39:59.183
Your recklessness caused
the deaths of two Hunters,

39:59.283 --> 40:00.551
including your own child.

40:00.651 --> 40:03.487
Yet another transgression,

40:03.587 --> 40:05.591
attempting to breed in human form.

40:05.691 --> 40:08.192
What do you care?

40:08.292 --> 40:09.689
We're all expendable to you.

40:11.529 --> 40:13.665
You're excluded from the Purge.

40:15.899 --> 40:19.604
You can't do that!

40:19.705 --> 40:21.273
You've become a demon!

40:21.372 --> 40:24.075
Injecting human flesh has
made you sick in the mind!

40:24.176 --> 40:27.011
Weak in the heart!

40:27.111 --> 40:29.847
I can separate you from
your misery right now.

40:31.448 --> 40:34.485
Or you do as I say, do you understand?

40:37.622 --> 40:39.424
Know your place.

40:45.662 --> 40:48.399
Forgive me, Musa.

40:48.499 --> 40:53.404
You're my brother. I am your servant.

40:53.504 --> 40:57.408
Your will is mine.
