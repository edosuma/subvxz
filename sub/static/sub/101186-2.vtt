WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:02.045
: Previously
on Wynonna Earp.

00:02.089 --> 00:03.133
Gloria Valdez.

00:03.177 --> 00:04.787
She's like some kind
of scientist?

00:04.830 --> 00:06.049
: We think it leads to
another way into the garden.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.182
Help us find Dr. Gloria Valdez.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.835
: My mom's not
one of the bodies.

00:09.879 --> 00:12.012
: Wherever Waverly is,
she's not safe.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.796
-Wynonna!
-We have to get to her.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.015
Go!

00:15.058 --> 00:16.277
: What is this place?

00:16.320 --> 00:17.582
: The blood
has to be fresh.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.020
-: Let's use him up.
-Bought us more time.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.196
Shut up and run!

00:22.718 --> 00:23.414
: Wynonna!

00:26.548 --> 00:27.418
Sheriff Haught.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.072
At least you are
wearing a smile.

00:31.509 --> 00:32.597
Nicole!

00:33.163 --> 00:34.425
Nicole!

00:36.645 --> 00:38.342
Girl, you are in
a league of your own.

00:38.386 --> 00:39.517
Lady, we gotta leave.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.997
How far down does it go?

00:41.519 --> 00:43.260
-All the way.
-Ah!

00:43.304 --> 00:45.697
My sister's girlfriend
is mutant meat or a pancake!

00:45.741 --> 00:48.265
-Waverly's gonna kill me!
-They're gonna kill you!

00:48.309 --> 00:50.311
-I'm gone.
-Haught! Stay alive!

00:50.354 --> 00:51.964
I'm gonna come find you!

00:52.008 --> 00:53.009
You are here!

00:53.879 --> 00:54.706
I am!

00:56.491 --> 00:58.058
But how are you here?

00:58.101 --> 00:59.059
And, uh...

01:00.277 --> 01:02.192
Why did your garments
not accompany you?

01:02.758 --> 01:04.716
Ahh! Oh my God!
Don't look at me!

01:04.760 --> 01:06.849
-I was not!
-Do not look at me!

01:06.892 --> 01:08.111
I would never!

01:09.156 --> 01:09.982
Although...

01:10.983 --> 01:12.420
-Sheriff Haught...
-Oh my God!

01:12.463 --> 01:15.336
I have seen many a fine
formed women in my lifetime.

01:15.379 --> 01:17.294
-Nope! Nope.
-This is nothing to me,

01:17.338 --> 01:19.383
this is merely water
off a duck's back.

01:19.427 --> 01:21.472
Well, I am not a damn duck,

01:21.994 --> 01:23.866
so stop talking and find
me something to wear!

01:33.658 --> 01:35.834
-I cannot get in.
-And I can't get out.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.010
I shall fetch help.

01:38.620 --> 01:39.795
And pants.

01:40.317 --> 01:41.449
And Waverly.

01:41.492 --> 01:42.972
I will get Waverly!

01:44.626 --> 01:45.801
Yeah.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.019
Yeah, Waverly!

02:04.863 --> 02:08.040
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

02:08.084 --> 02:10.608
♪ I know that ain't
no way to live ♪

02:10.652 --> 02:13.133
♪ So I told that devil

02:13.176 --> 02:15.439
♪ To take you back

02:15.483 --> 02:17.659
♪ I told that devil

02:17.702 --> 02:20.096
♪ To take you back

02:23.230 --> 02:24.144
: Waverly.

02:24.709 --> 02:25.536
Waverly Earp!

02:26.102 --> 02:27.016
Hey!

02:27.669 --> 02:29.323
The fire's died down.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.237
You know...

02:31.238 --> 02:32.804
Also, we built a fire?

02:33.675 --> 02:35.285
You cut your hand.
You fed the machine.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.200
Don't you know
how dangerous this is?

02:37.244 --> 02:39.594
No, and neither do you.
We don't know anything!

02:39.637 --> 02:41.509
I know I swore
to protect you!

02:41.552 --> 02:43.685
And I am trying
to protect this place,

02:44.468 --> 02:45.774
just like my father did.

02:45.817 --> 02:46.905
Since when?

02:46.949 --> 02:48.429
Stop talking nonsense
and listen!

02:48.472 --> 02:51.040
I am a fully grown
half-angel.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.738
And an adult human lady!

02:53.782 --> 02:55.653
Speaking of adult,
Nicole is here!

02:55.697 --> 02:57.916
What? Where? How?

02:57.960 --> 03:00.963
She's in this hole
just a way back there.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.965
Next time, maybe
lead with that!

03:03.008 --> 03:04.401
Well, Lord knows I tried!

03:05.315 --> 03:06.186
Well...

03:06.751 --> 03:08.144
Are you sure it's her?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.885
I saw her with
my own two eyes.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.148
How does she look?

03:12.192 --> 03:12.888
Um...

03:13.758 --> 03:15.586
I think you will be pleased.

03:16.761 --> 03:17.806
Eat wood!

03:18.285 --> 03:19.721
-Ugh!
-My bad.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.375
Teenagers are the worst!

03:21.418 --> 03:23.333
Has anyone in history
ever noted that before?

03:23.377 --> 03:24.856
I said, my bad.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.644
Those things are everywhere.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.689
"Those things" used to be
brilliant physicists.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.344
They were working on some
inter-dimensional gateway.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.085
-To the Garden?
-Whatever it was,

03:36.128 --> 03:37.391
Black Badge was trying
to weaponize it.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.131
But once they actually
got the thing to open,

03:39.741 --> 03:41.482
BBD panicked
and gassed everyone.

03:42.047 --> 03:44.485
It's the 2005 Chili Cookoff
all over again...

03:44.963 --> 03:46.269
minus the edibles-laced
cornbread,

03:46.313 --> 03:47.749
and Hollaback Girl on repeat.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.229
You might be even
weirder than me.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.187
And my best friend for six
months has been a rat.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.716
There's gotta be another way
to get into the lower levels.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.065
If your friend fell
into the lab,

04:00.109 --> 04:01.458
she's already bread
for the walking dead.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.591
But if she fell
into the gate room...

04:03.634 --> 04:04.940
Yeah, she fell
into the gate room.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.594
Because you want
that to be true?

04:07.116 --> 04:08.378
Hey, you know what?

04:08.422 --> 04:10.902
What are you doing
here, kid? Huh?

04:10.946 --> 04:13.035
You've been camping out here
at mutant manor for what?

04:13.078 --> 04:14.297
Months? Years?

04:14.341 --> 04:16.343
I can't leave my mom, okay?

04:16.821 --> 04:18.693
I know the chances
of Dr. Gloria Valdez

04:18.736 --> 04:20.608
having survived is more unlikely

04:20.651 --> 04:21.957
than an anti-vaxxer
who Botoxes.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.089
But I need to know
what happened to her.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.266
And if I find proof
she bit it, I bounce.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.442
Were you home-schooled, kid?

04:28.485 --> 04:30.400
'Cause you might want
to workshop that eulogy.

04:30.444 --> 04:32.054
All I'm trying to say is...

04:32.097 --> 04:34.317
if the gas turned her
totally toxic Avenger,

04:34.361 --> 04:35.884
I'll take care of it. Like...

04:41.324 --> 04:43.935
-That means I kill her myself.
-I cracked that code.

04:43.979 --> 04:44.806
-Yeah, okay.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.024
-Rachel...
-Shh!

04:51.378 --> 04:52.596
Yeah, I'll tell you later.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.210
Rachel, we can't hide forever.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.648
I'm gonna go find Nicole
with or without you.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.563
Okay, okay yeah.

05:02.606 --> 05:03.955
There is another way
into the lab.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.522
But we really need
three people to get in.

05:05.566 --> 05:06.523
Well, we have two.

05:07.785 --> 05:09.004
And bonus, they're both
super fucking weird.

05:09.047 --> 05:12.355
So listen, we can help
each other, alright?

05:12.399 --> 05:15.140
But I'm not leaving this place
until I find my friend.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.664
And I didn't bring
any deodorant.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.535
-I can tell.
-Nope,

05:18.579 --> 05:20.276
not abandoning any of 'em.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.017
My Haught cop.
My celestial sister.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.584
My vampire baby daddy.

05:24.236 --> 05:25.716
Your life is wildin', girl.

05:27.457 --> 05:28.284
Together.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.160
-: Nicole! Baby!
-Waverly?

05:35.204 --> 05:37.511
You're here, you're
really here! How?!

05:37.554 --> 05:40.122
-How are you here?
-I have no idea!

05:40.165 --> 05:42.080
It's so foggy.
For a second I was there,

05:42.124 --> 05:43.604
and then I was...

05:44.431 --> 05:45.170
Wow.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.477
Are you okay?

05:47.521 --> 05:48.565
Are you?

05:48.609 --> 05:50.306
Get in here and check.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.355
What? Oh, God!

05:55.398 --> 05:57.487
Baby, you're in some
sort of silo prison.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.707
Yeah, and Doc saw me naked!

05:59.750 --> 06:01.361
But it's fine,
I'm over it, so...

06:03.667 --> 06:05.103
So, where is everyone else?

06:05.147 --> 06:06.670
Is Purgatory okay?

06:06.714 --> 06:07.889
Did you see Wynonna?

06:07.932 --> 06:09.499
No, it's just...

06:09.543 --> 06:10.587
it's just me.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.808
Here with you, now.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.593
God, it's really you.

06:17.899 --> 06:18.900
Waverly...

06:19.379 --> 06:20.815
Who else would I be?

06:23.470 --> 06:24.862
Wynonna!

06:25.863 --> 06:26.908
Argh!

06:27.387 --> 06:29.127
I'm down here,
I'm still alive!

06:31.042 --> 06:32.304
Ow.

06:35.612 --> 06:36.961
Oh, walnuts.

06:46.493 --> 06:49.409
The lab is kept de-oxygenated
to keep the samples sterile.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.628
All those words make me itchy.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.282
Unless you want to suffocate,

06:54.152 --> 06:56.416
we have to wear decontamination
suits and masks.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.548
Ebola outbreak, but make
it fashion. Got it.

06:59.201 --> 07:01.421
We have to cross the lab
to get into the gate room.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.597
But first, we need
to find a keycard

07:03.640 --> 07:05.337
that opens the door
to the gate room.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.428
And where do we think that is?

07:08.471 --> 07:10.778
Around the neck of some mutant
Black Badge scientists.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.257
The good news is

07:12.301 --> 07:14.912
they tend to stay
dormant, in stasis,

07:14.956 --> 07:15.957
unless you wake them.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.437
Say, with a beaver blaster?

07:17.915 --> 07:19.439
Is everything a
sex joke to you?

07:19.917 --> 07:21.832
I do try to scissor one in
as often as possible.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.095
So how do we do this?

07:25.183 --> 07:26.707
I have to find
the other keycard.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.012
And once we're in the gate room,

07:28.056 --> 07:29.840
we have to swipe both
cards simultaneously

07:29.884 --> 07:31.929
to reopen whatever portal
my mom was working on.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.931
We'll only have one chance
to find what's at the bottom

07:33.975 --> 07:36.020
-of the Nic-hole.
-And the lab is full

07:36.064 --> 07:37.152
of rabid lab coats.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.720
So whatever you do,
keep it quiet.

07:39.763 --> 07:40.547
What?

07:42.113 --> 07:43.854
We could short circuit
the force field?

07:43.898 --> 07:46.335
-But with what?
-Ah! There!

07:46.378 --> 07:49.164
That's better! Slay!

07:49.207 --> 07:51.514
Lemme guess: Island of Lesbos,
resort collection?

07:51.993 --> 07:53.124
What the hell is that?

07:53.168 --> 07:54.822
It's just time to feed
the machine.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.519
The machine?

07:58.216 --> 07:59.130
It is my turn.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.350
-I will go.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.786
Guys? There's a machine?

08:03.570 --> 08:05.223
Yeah. It runs on blood.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.137
Human blood.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.966
Yeah, we have
to feed it... blood.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.228
Sure. Okay.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.536
So what happens if you didn't?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.799
Feed it, I mean?

08:17.453 --> 08:19.281
I do not think
we want to find out.

08:22.676 --> 08:25.156
Wow. This place is a lot.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.204
I still don't understand
how you got here.

08:29.247 --> 08:30.422
Yeah. Me neither.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.207
Baby?

08:33.469 --> 08:35.776
I have got to get out
of this cage, okay?

08:35.819 --> 08:37.691
'Cause these cherry blossoms,
this force field,

08:37.734 --> 08:39.214
they're not my friends.

08:39.257 --> 08:41.738
-Do you hear that?

08:42.609 --> 08:43.610
I'm pretty sure I don't.

08:45.481 --> 08:46.482
It's calling to me.

08:48.136 --> 08:50.573
The throne. My father's throne.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.705
Julian.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.315
Kevin said that
I would sit on it,

08:53.358 --> 08:54.708
to save the world.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.448
And that I would turn to stone.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.363
Ha...

08:59.974 --> 09:00.931
Waverly...

09:02.150 --> 09:04.674
Baby, you've already
sacrificed so much.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.197
Yeah, well, I'm
not the only one.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.591
Doc became a vampire
to save us.

09:08.635 --> 09:09.897
Oh.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.289
Is that why he did it?

09:11.855 --> 09:12.987
Yeah, see...

09:14.466 --> 09:17.774
I thought he was just scared
to grow old and... die.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.734
-That's pretty harsh.
-I'm sorry.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.737
Look, I think I'm just hangry.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.740
Yeah, well, imagine being Doc.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.437
He hasn't fed in days.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.489
Ah, there, there,
you old boot.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.927
You need more blood?
I know the feeling.

10:13.177 --> 10:13.917
Ugh!

10:29.672 --> 10:31.935
Everything's gone to shit,
must be Tuesday!

10:31.979 --> 10:34.634
-No way, not today.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.636
When I dreamt about dying,

10:36.679 --> 10:38.725
it involved me
in Waverly's arms

10:39.203 --> 10:41.118
and Waverly
in Sara Lance cosplay.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.732
The garden is coming to life.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.519
You're not wearing
Bulshar's ring.

10:52.086 --> 10:52.826
Well, yeah, I...

10:53.783 --> 10:56.177
I guess he's gone now. Bulshar.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.615
Oh yeah, we smote that
basic bish but good.

11:01.356 --> 11:04.185
Smoted? Smited?

11:04.228 --> 11:07.449
Hey, did you ever
think to ask him

11:07.492 --> 11:08.929
why he was trying so hard

11:08.972 --> 11:10.321
to get in here
in the first place?

11:10.365 --> 11:12.584
I just assumed, like most
balding sociopaths,

11:12.628 --> 11:13.585
he wanted to play God.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.283
Woman,

11:15.326 --> 11:17.328
look around!

11:17.372 --> 11:18.416
God...

11:19.156 --> 11:21.681
hasn't been here
for a long, long time.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.685
Yup. He hit it,

11:26.207 --> 11:28.339
then he quit it.
Left humanity on read.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.560
Maybe we should just, like,
chill on the God talk.

11:31.603 --> 11:34.258
And what kind of batshit

11:34.302 --> 11:36.260
playground experiment
for creation was this?

11:36.304 --> 11:37.740
You know, there was a guy,

11:38.262 --> 11:39.655
when Doc and I first got here.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.005
He called this place a prison.

11:42.049 --> 11:45.008
And then he sort of
chopped off his own head.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.096
Men.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.011
So dramatic, right?

11:48.055 --> 11:49.491
Yeah, I guess.

11:52.102 --> 11:55.540
So are you, like, super pissed
that Wynonna drugged you?

11:56.237 --> 11:57.412
The things I'm pissed about...

11:57.455 --> 11:59.370
well, it's a long list.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.155
But...

12:01.198 --> 12:02.678
all will be remedied

12:02.722 --> 12:05.072
one by one by one,

12:05.115 --> 12:06.769
just as soon as I get
out of here.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.119
Baby.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.907
My mask. I can't breathe.

12:14.821 --> 12:15.735
What's it called

12:15.778 --> 12:17.214
when you don't get enough oxygen

12:17.258 --> 12:20.043
and you feel drank,
and you start to...

12:24.613 --> 12:25.614
You're getting hypoxeia.

12:25.657 --> 12:28.051
Yeah. Talk about
silent but deadly.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.010
Mask leak, c'est chic.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.491
Oh, get back down there, mister!

12:33.535 --> 12:35.580
-Shut up.
-Oh shit.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.887
Oh! Nice to see you, mute-aunt,

12:37.931 --> 12:39.454
where's my mute-uncle?

12:41.195 --> 12:43.675
Nowhere. Bad for brain.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.416
We're good, we're good.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.288
Nice one, lil' baby condom!

12:47.331 --> 12:49.203
-But which, which is which?
-I don't know!

13:06.176 --> 13:08.831
Fuck you! Yeah!

13:09.571 --> 13:12.269
Who's a girl gotta screw
around here to get a gun?

13:13.531 --> 13:14.445
Hiya, Red!

13:15.751 --> 13:16.491
Wynonna!

13:18.101 --> 13:19.668
Hi! Who's your crawl-y friend?

13:28.633 --> 13:30.635
She almost killed us,
getting to you.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.900
-What's wrong with her?
-Hypoxia.

13:33.943 --> 13:37.294
I wasn't gettin' no oxygen.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.643
Okay? None.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.820
You're something else, Earp.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.865
I don't ever half ass it.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.258
I ass and a half it.

13:45.433 --> 13:46.782
Whatever you are, you're...

13:47.609 --> 13:48.610
you're my ass.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.481
That sounds kinda lesbian.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.526
Ugh!

13:59.708 --> 14:00.927
Well, I'll be damned.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.146
Not literally, I hope.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.201
Nicole.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.514
The many faces of Nicole.

14:28.128 --> 14:29.607
Not Nicole.

14:31.696 --> 14:32.959
An imposter.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.051
This prison is not for us.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.969
It is for the thing I left
Waverly alone with!

14:57.592 --> 15:00.508
Her leg is definitely broken
in at least two places.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.249
-Oh! Ah! Ah!

15:02.727 --> 15:04.338
-Three.
-It's okay.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.296
When we get out of here,
I'm going to draw

15:06.340 --> 15:07.558
a bunch of dicks on your cast.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.647
That's really sweet.

15:09.691 --> 15:10.822
You know, from a fall like that,

15:10.866 --> 15:12.259
I still think I got off
pretty easy.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.000
: Well, we all
like to get off.

15:14.478 --> 15:17.612
But you, please, have to stop
dropping things.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.877
You know, if this is
a proposal, I gotta say...

15:22.312 --> 15:23.705
it's missing some baby carrots.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.663
I don't know what that means.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.535
It means,
I'm already spoken for.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.842
I just haven't had a chance
to tell Waverly that.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.718
Sheriff, I'm sick and
tired of listening

15:36.761 --> 15:38.676
to all the disgustingly
hot premarital sex

15:38.720 --> 15:40.722
-you're having in my house.
-You've been listening?

15:40.765 --> 15:43.551
So let's go make you
make an honest woman

15:43.594 --> 15:44.987
out of my little sister.

15:46.467 --> 15:47.990
Nicole Haught,

15:48.034 --> 15:49.252
will you open the back door

15:49.296 --> 15:50.862
to the maybe garden
of Eden with me?

15:52.081 --> 15:53.126
: No one's
opening anything.

15:55.824 --> 15:56.694
Is that...?

16:04.050 --> 16:05.616
Dr. Gloria Valdez.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.532
My mom died trying
to keep this portal shut.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.013
Try to change that
and I'll kill you.

16:16.410 --> 16:17.889
Doc was supposed to
feed the machine!

16:17.933 --> 16:19.804
Yeah, and he failed. Again!

16:19.848 --> 16:21.241
Big surprise!

16:23.025 --> 16:24.113
What's happening?

16:24.157 --> 16:26.333
Let freedom reign.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.552
Friggin' finally!

16:33.427 --> 16:36.256
Ah-ha! Thank you, Waverly!

16:40.825 --> 16:41.696
Come on.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.577
Wait. Nicole...

16:54.709 --> 16:56.450
-You taste like--
-: Waverly!

16:56.972 --> 16:59.453
Waverly, get away from her!
That thing is not Nicole!

16:59.496 --> 17:00.845
Like sulfur.

17:01.585 --> 17:02.847
: Why are
the smoke shows

17:02.891 --> 17:04.023
always dumb as shit?

17:04.066 --> 17:06.068
God, if you hurt
the real Nicole--

17:06.112 --> 17:07.896
Oh, sweetie...

17:08.462 --> 17:09.811
I'm going to hurt all of you.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.118
You can call me Eve.

17:12.161 --> 17:13.467
Stay away from her!

17:13.510 --> 17:16.992
And the important thing
is, I'm out.

17:17.036 --> 17:17.993
Ah!

17:21.475 --> 17:22.345
Rachel!

17:23.433 --> 17:24.782
Your Mom wouldn't
want this for you.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.393
Stop pretending
like you know her.

17:26.436 --> 17:27.742
I know how your mom felt.

17:27.785 --> 17:30.005
'Cause I would die
to save my sister.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.050
Or kill.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.269
Anyone.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.054
Everyone.

17:35.663 --> 17:36.838
Wynonna, tell her the truth.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.582
I really did lose my Mom,
a lot of people,

17:41.625 --> 17:43.105
when I was young, but I grew up.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.411
And now you have to.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.066
Your mom did this so you could.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.806
Wynonna knew your
mom was dead.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.200
Before we even got here.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.201
Narc.

17:55.465 --> 17:56.249
You lied to me.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.470
-You're Black Badge.
-No.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.124
-We're two friends.
-Best friends.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.695
She said it first,
there's no take-backs right?

18:08.304 --> 18:12.003
...who love the same angel
more than anything in the world.

18:12.613 --> 18:13.353
You're...

18:14.093 --> 18:15.268
You're polygamists?

18:18.227 --> 18:19.794
Something is happening on
the other side of the door,

18:19.837 --> 18:20.708
I've got to get through!

18:24.886 --> 18:27.323
They just, they just
left her here to rot.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.108
I couldn't save her.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.457
Well, let us
save someone else.

18:32.241 --> 18:33.982
Whatever you are,
Doc's going to kill you.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.723
Ah, save your heteronormative

18:35.766 --> 18:38.160
hero hogwash for
humanity, sweetie,

18:38.204 --> 18:41.337
which incidentally,
I preclude by eons.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.426
Just say you're old,
you pretentious bitch!

18:43.470 --> 18:45.776
I am a nightmare
unto the world.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.822
And your cherubic
little daddy died

18:47.865 --> 18:49.824
before he could teach
you how to save it.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.043
From me!

18:52.087 --> 18:54.437
Ah! For once I wish we'd
just take on a demon

18:54.481 --> 18:56.135
that isn't such
a talker, you know?

19:00.965 --> 19:02.837
Well, it's not all bad news.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.839
See, you succeeded
where the snake failed.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.841
You freed me from this prison.

19:07.276 --> 19:10.105
You and your cute little cowboy.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.414
I am a gunslinger,
you amateur.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.466
The best in the west!

19:23.510 --> 19:25.903
Hi, gorgeous! Ya miss me?

19:29.342 --> 19:30.865
But I screwed all this up.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.215
Hey, your mistakes
do not define you.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.609
This crazy chick

19:35.652 --> 19:38.177
without a gun
is living proof of that.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.527
Nicole and I are going
through that portal

19:40.570 --> 19:42.006
to rescue our people

19:42.050 --> 19:44.487
and all the bullets in the world
are not gonna stop us.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.581
You just wanted
to punch her again.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.019
I can't believe I may be
stuck with you forever.

19:57.718 --> 19:58.893
: It's cracking.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.634
Oh shit, shit, shit!

20:01.243 --> 20:02.331
Well, if we're going
to get into the garden,

20:02.375 --> 20:04.028
we do it now, this is
our only way out.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.292
Oh!

20:07.684 --> 20:10.296
Wow, you are real handsome
when you lose control.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.167
You do not get
to speak as him.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.649
Please, Holliday. Please.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.128
Don't hurt me.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.435
Shut your lying mouth.

20:23.526 --> 20:26.094
Earth angel brought a demon.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.008
Smart.

20:29.445 --> 20:31.404
-Doc!
-You're one of us!

20:31.447 --> 20:33.144
When are you gonna man up
and pick a side?

20:33.188 --> 20:36.322
From the devil that cannot
even pick a face.

20:36.365 --> 20:38.193
Don't think about leaving!

20:38.237 --> 20:39.368
I'm not done with you yet.

20:39.890 --> 20:40.935
You are done.

20:48.377 --> 20:51.250
And you will never
touch her aga--

20:54.253 --> 20:55.166
Doc.

20:55.993 --> 20:56.907
How could you?

20:59.040 --> 21:00.302
I love you.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.392
-Enough.
-More than.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.743
Come now, we are vamoosing.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.789
I cannot let Eve
leave her prison.

21:09.877 --> 21:12.662
-We will not.
-I will not.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.984
Do these even connect
to anything

21:30.027 --> 21:31.725
or is it just like that
door close button

21:31.768 --> 21:33.379
-on the elevator?
-Yank the...

21:34.249 --> 21:35.076
Tug the...

21:36.338 --> 21:38.209
Yeah, fine, everything
is a sex joke, okay?

21:38.253 --> 21:40.211
-Guys, they're almost inside!

21:41.648 --> 21:42.866
Toss her your gun!

21:44.999 --> 21:47.044
-Ah!

21:47.088 --> 21:48.872
With the safety on!

21:48.916 --> 21:50.526
-I'm sorry!

21:50.570 --> 21:51.875
Key cards, we gotta the thing

21:51.919 --> 21:52.920
with the key cards!

21:53.790 --> 21:56.967
Ready? One, two, three!

22:00.014 --> 22:01.624
Holy shit.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.234
Lit like a Fukushima weekend.

22:04.975 --> 22:08.457
Red... Don't let all
my tricep dips go to waste.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.154
Ah! My leg's broken!

22:10.198 --> 22:12.243
Well, suck it up, Sheriff,
she needs you!

22:13.854 --> 22:15.421
No, Doc and Waverly need you,

22:15.464 --> 22:16.596
they need the Earp heir.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.641
I need medical attention.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.121
Don't you dare do this to me,

22:20.164 --> 22:22.863
not after all your guilt
trips and your punching.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.386
Yeah, we do have fun,
don't we?

22:26.823 --> 22:28.434
They're almost inside.
They'll kill you.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.305
Not a chance.

22:31.611 --> 22:34.744
I'm gonna be waiting for you
back in Purgatory.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.833
Nicole, Nicole. I can't.

22:39.053 --> 22:40.881
I can't do this without you.

22:40.924 --> 22:43.797
Actually, only you can.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.974
It has to be you, Wynonna.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.977
It was always gonna be you.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.114
The gate is closing!

23:01.205 --> 23:03.294
Don't you dare
leave her alone.

23:03.338 --> 23:05.035
I won't. I swear.

23:08.604 --> 23:09.475
I'll see you at home.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.041
All of you.

23:17.178 --> 23:18.745
-Ah!
-Earp!

23:21.878 --> 23:23.445
Argh!

23:25.273 --> 23:26.013
Huh?

23:34.935 --> 23:36.023
Oh, man.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.678
Titanic taught a whole
generation of chicks

23:38.721 --> 23:41.202
they can just throw away
jewelry, like, "hey!"

23:41.245 --> 23:43.552
-Come on.

23:46.076 --> 23:46.990
I'm already here.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.603
And I'm only wearing
half a shirt.

23:52.735 --> 23:53.954
I'm gonna catch a cold.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.232
I know you're probably evil,

24:11.275 --> 24:13.060
but minus the shears
through your stomach,

24:13.103 --> 24:15.105
whatever you're doing
with your bod is working.

24:15.932 --> 24:16.933
Are you a clone?

24:18.065 --> 24:19.196
Wy-Clone-A?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.546
: I am Eve.

24:22.286 --> 24:23.679
I'm Death.

24:23.723 --> 24:24.463
God...

24:25.507 --> 24:26.682
is my voice really
that annoying?

24:26.726 --> 24:29.903
I am going to flay
your friends alive

24:30.730 --> 24:33.689
and strangle you
with their skin.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.691
Jesus, Orphan Whack.

24:35.735 --> 24:37.214
Take a Midol and a nap.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.215
: Waverly!

24:40.653 --> 24:41.523
Okay.

24:42.872 --> 24:43.873
Well, at least I know
I'm in the right place.

24:53.230 --> 24:54.536
Fucking humans.

25:04.981 --> 25:06.374
Eve cannot escape.

25:09.986 --> 25:12.511
She cannot be allowed
to enter the realm of Men.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.043
I am the Guardian.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.874
I am the failsafe.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.012
Ugh!

25:46.849 --> 25:48.329
Maybe Wynonna
didn't make it through?

25:48.372 --> 25:50.070
Oh no.

25:50.113 --> 25:51.375
No, that's a good sign.

25:51.419 --> 25:52.899
She's definitely driving
somebody crazy in there.

25:54.770 --> 25:56.119
The mutants
are almost through.

25:57.033 --> 25:59.558
-I can't do this anymore.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.342
Rachel. Rachel Valdez...

26:04.301 --> 26:06.303
-Where you from?
-The Yucatan.

26:07.087 --> 26:10.046
My... our family's line
goes all the way back

26:10.090 --> 26:11.004
to the Mayans.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.006
Actually...

26:14.529 --> 26:16.705
my mom used to tell me this
story about our ancestors.

26:16.749 --> 26:19.012
Hey. Don't stop there,
George R. R. Martin.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.797
About 300 years ago,

26:22.363 --> 26:24.757
there was this mestiza princess.

26:25.801 --> 26:26.889
A warrior princess.

26:26.933 --> 26:27.673
Ooh.

26:28.412 --> 26:30.545
Mayan Xena.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.894
I already dig her.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.853
They called her The Valdez.

26:35.202 --> 26:36.682
That is awesome.

26:36.725 --> 26:37.770
I know, right?

26:38.379 --> 26:40.120
After she proved worthy in war,

26:41.295 --> 26:44.603
The Valdez was given
an entire kingdom to rule,

26:44.646 --> 26:46.256
and immortality to do so.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.694
Wow, that beats a shiny medal.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.613
Hey, Nicole, are we gonna die?

26:54.656 --> 26:55.614
No.

26:58.921 --> 26:59.705
Maybe.

27:00.836 --> 27:03.273
But we've still got
options. Right?

27:03.970 --> 27:05.362
Like what?

27:05.406 --> 27:06.233
We fight.

27:06.886 --> 27:08.365
This war isn't over.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.237
It's just beginning.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.895
Oh God, I can't believe
I'm going to go out

27:15.938 --> 27:17.070
blasting beavers.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.638
Yeah, stick with me, kid.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.640
I'll show you how it's done.

27:28.734 --> 27:29.560
Get down!

27:30.649 --> 27:32.041
Mr. I-Am-A-Weapon,

27:32.694 --> 27:33.956
it's me,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.176
Mr. I-Am-A-Happy-To-See-You.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.395
I see the shears
did not fell you?

27:38.439 --> 27:41.311
Well, maybe this will. Argh!

27:41.355 --> 27:42.486
What the hell, Doc?

27:49.145 --> 27:50.494
As far as reunions go,

27:50.538 --> 27:51.974
this is better
than my high school,

27:52.018 --> 27:53.933
but not as good as 90210.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.543
I demand

27:56.065 --> 27:58.285
you stop using the voice

27:58.328 --> 28:01.680
of the woman
that I care deeply for.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.728
"Care deeply for"?

28:06.772 --> 28:08.817
At least I know you're the real
emotionally constipated Doc.

28:08.861 --> 28:11.690
And you are a fraud!

28:13.474 --> 28:15.041
-And a harlot!
-Ahh!

28:15.911 --> 28:17.739
That's like your favorite
thing about me.

28:20.524 --> 28:23.310
The real Wynonna
is back in Purgatory.

28:24.746 --> 28:25.573
Listen!

28:25.616 --> 28:27.314
I found Nicole,

28:27.357 --> 28:29.490
she decked me,
we did a road trip,

28:29.533 --> 28:31.448
we got sniped,
met a mouthy teen,

28:31.492 --> 28:34.756
we found and broke into
an abandoned facility,

28:34.800 --> 28:36.715
and then we killed a bunch
of scientist mutants.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.760
But now I'm here!

28:38.804 --> 28:40.370
And we gotta get back there.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.982
That is exactly what the false
Wynonna would say.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.375
Your tricks are useless.

28:47.464 --> 28:48.335
Tricks are for kids.

28:49.815 --> 28:50.772
We had one.

28:51.991 --> 28:54.776
Alice. Remember? Huh?

28:57.257 --> 28:58.258
Alice.

28:59.694 --> 29:00.739
It's me, Doc.

29:02.001 --> 29:02.915
It's me.

29:04.264 --> 29:05.831
I'm no deep fake. I'm real.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.661
I cannot risk it.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.402
I swore to protect Waverly!

29:14.056 --> 29:15.884
Hollywood!

29:21.020 --> 29:22.325
Our safe word.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.242
For when private
time gets too...

29:26.286 --> 29:27.635
Honky tonk.

29:44.347 --> 29:45.305
It is you.

29:51.877 --> 29:54.401
You came back to save her.

29:58.753 --> 29:59.841
I said that I would.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.325
Do we have time for this?

30:08.197 --> 30:10.286
No, alas.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.250
Where is Waverly?

30:18.773 --> 30:19.861
Yonder.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.298
You go to her.

30:24.387 --> 30:25.824
I will deal
with your other half.

30:28.478 --> 30:29.871
Go easy on her money-maker.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.354
Actually go hard.
I don't need the competition.

30:42.014 --> 30:44.451
-: What did you do?
-I came home.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.801
This is not your home.

30:47.323 --> 30:48.847
Your home is with me!

30:49.848 --> 30:52.154
-And Nicole.
-This is my destiny.

30:52.198 --> 30:54.200
Doc. Jeremy.

30:55.505 --> 30:56.202
Nedley?

30:56.245 --> 30:57.594
I've always been here.

30:58.247 --> 31:00.902
I will always be here.
Time is a flat circle.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.512
Your ass is gonna be
a flat circle

31:02.556 --> 31:04.253
if you spend eternity
on that thing.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.740
She cannot be
allowed to escape.

31:12.783 --> 31:14.089
This is my duty.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.092
I am the heir.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.443
Not this lukewarm shit again.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.932
There was never a horse
that could not be broken.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.674
Or a cowboy who
could not be thrown.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.939
Ah. 'Sup, Doc?

31:37.983 --> 31:39.462
You really gonna be able
to snuff the life

31:39.506 --> 31:40.811
outta these puppy dog peepers?

31:42.465 --> 31:44.946
Nothing but a parlor trick.

31:46.426 --> 31:47.557
No. No.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.777
A very special skill.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.345
You're impressed, admit it.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.173
Terrified too.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.828
Ugh, God, there is so much
useless pop culture knowledge

31:57.872 --> 31:59.918
-in this thing. I...
-It is not useless!

31:59.961 --> 32:02.703
-Ugh!
-It shows he has passion!

32:04.879 --> 32:06.402
I also have a passion.

32:06.446 --> 32:09.057
And it involves me leaving
this godforsaken place,

32:09.101 --> 32:11.059
and getting what I'm owed
in the Ghost River Triangle.

32:11.103 --> 32:13.801
You are stronger
than I expected.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.283
Guess he's been working out.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.547
I would like to congratulate
the real Jeremy

32:20.590 --> 32:22.418
on his fitness transformation,

32:22.462 --> 32:25.117
but right now,
it's a real hassle.

32:32.124 --> 32:33.821
: I told
you, I'm leaving,

32:34.256 --> 32:35.562
and I'm getting to Purgatory!

32:36.606 --> 32:38.173
You are right
about the first part.

32:48.618 --> 32:50.229
We are running out of time.

32:51.534 --> 32:52.666
Earps!

32:53.928 --> 32:56.235
It is high time we saddle up!

33:01.066 --> 33:02.458
Waverly Earp,

33:02.502 --> 33:05.766
you need to stand your hiney
up off that stone seat

33:05.809 --> 33:07.028
before it's too late.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.116
I am the guardian.

33:08.638 --> 33:09.770
You are the champion.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.467
What we are is sisters.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.513
We must all submit
to our destinies.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.428
I am done submitting to shit.

33:17.299 --> 33:18.605
Fine. We'll do it the hard way.

33:23.436 --> 33:24.959
Waves, what the hell?

33:26.569 --> 33:28.310
You cannot undo
what has been promised.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.487
Right, right.

33:31.531 --> 33:33.054
'Cause promises are important.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.409
I have the ring
you gave Nicole.

33:42.194 --> 33:43.804
Stand up and come with me.

33:45.371 --> 33:46.676
Give it back to her.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.811
The guardians of the garden
do not get to love.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.291
You are not just the guardian.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.337
You are an Earp.

34:00.995 --> 34:02.518
She didn't even say yes.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.219
She will, baby girl.

34:10.265 --> 34:11.962
The curse is over, Waves,

34:12.746 --> 34:14.530
it's time to start living
for ourselves.

34:17.055 --> 34:17.751
Wynonna...

34:19.448 --> 34:20.101
Help.

34:24.366 --> 34:27.369
All this destiny, curse, fate,

34:27.413 --> 34:29.502
heirs of anything bullshit?

34:29.545 --> 34:30.633
It's canceled.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.165
Take me home.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.258
: Girls?!

34:46.997 --> 34:48.651
What do we do about
the shape-shifter?

34:48.695 --> 34:50.740
How do we keep Eve
locked in the garden?

34:51.741 --> 34:53.091
We'll find another way.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.267
We always Earpin' do.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.151
-Ahh!
-: Hurry!

35:10.630 --> 35:11.979
Okay! This is it!

35:12.632 --> 35:14.547
What the hell? Oh, my God!

35:16.636 --> 35:18.507
Please tell me you remember.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.032
-Third times a charm!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:23.773 --> 35:24.731
Oh, my God.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.082
Oh, my God. Seriously?

35:28.126 --> 35:28.996
This one.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.217
Knock, knock, anybody home?

35:34.610 --> 35:36.046
Which one is it?

35:36.090 --> 35:37.787
-Shit!

35:39.528 --> 35:42.009
My money is on
the one that is glowing!

35:42.966 --> 35:44.794
-Oh yeah.
-Let's blow this popsicle--

35:44.838 --> 35:46.840
Er, blood machine
murder stand!

35:46.883 --> 35:49.059
-Ahh! Wait!
-: There's no more time!

35:49.103 --> 35:50.060
The ring!

35:50.104 --> 35:51.584
No, that thing
is tacky as hell!

35:51.627 --> 35:52.759
Enough!

35:52.802 --> 35:54.935
No more semi-biblical
bullshit, okay?

35:54.978 --> 35:55.631
Okay.

35:57.024 --> 35:57.677
Eden?

35:58.330 --> 35:59.983
More like eatin' a...

36:00.549 --> 36:01.246
dick!

36:12.561 --> 36:13.954
And I'm back at the stairs.

36:15.521 --> 36:16.348
Waverly?

36:17.610 --> 36:18.393
Doc?

36:20.178 --> 36:21.048
Peacemaker?

36:25.052 --> 36:26.053
It's gone forever.

36:34.104 --> 36:34.975
But they're not.

36:36.629 --> 36:37.543
They made it.

36:39.545 --> 36:40.589
They had to.

36:50.556 --> 36:51.644
Back at the well.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.081
But not in it.

36:55.169 --> 36:56.649
Woo, doggie!

36:59.434 --> 37:01.567
In your face, you stupid hole.

37:02.742 --> 37:03.743
Wynonna?

37:05.919 --> 37:06.920
Waverly?

37:08.965 --> 37:10.097
I got your satchel!

37:16.756 --> 37:17.583
Home.

37:26.722 --> 37:27.593
Home.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.606
Nicole. Nicole!

37:53.140 --> 37:54.924
Eat shit, shit eater!

37:54.968 --> 37:56.752
I'm warning you. No trespassing!

38:01.540 --> 38:02.541
Waverly.

38:13.073 --> 38:14.117
It's me.

38:16.337 --> 38:17.556
It's me.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.035
Oh God, it's you.

38:22.038 --> 38:22.865
I'm home.

38:27.783 --> 38:29.132
Are you real?

38:30.177 --> 38:31.091
Are you?

38:32.875 --> 38:34.050
Get in here and check.

Waverly?

40:14.150 --> 40:15.587
I think we both know
where she went first.

40:15.630 --> 40:16.501
We'll find her.

40:19.373 --> 40:20.809
I believe these belong to you.

40:22.942 --> 40:25.858
If you ever need them,
they are yours.

40:29.601 --> 40:30.515
So am I.

40:34.649 --> 40:35.650
Oh my God, Doc.

40:36.651 --> 40:37.478
The town.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.485
I don't think I've ever
been this happy.

40:45.834 --> 40:47.270
So why do I feel like bawling?

40:49.011 --> 40:50.491
Well, after what we just did,

40:50.535 --> 40:52.319
You're probably
pretty dehydrated.

40:55.409 --> 40:59.195
Your laugh is like Christmas.

41:01.937 --> 41:03.548
Your lips are so soft.

41:04.679 --> 41:06.115
Are you going to spend all day

41:06.159 --> 41:07.900
listing all the things
you like about me?

41:08.596 --> 41:10.076
More like the rest
of my life.

41:14.210 --> 41:15.124
I love you.

41:18.606 --> 41:21.827
I'm also loving
the Little Mermaid vibes.

41:23.002 --> 41:25.613
So what, you just zipped
into the Ghost River Triangle

41:25.657 --> 41:26.527
and got extensions?

41:27.572 --> 41:28.703
I just grew it out.

41:30.575 --> 41:31.837
What?

41:31.880 --> 41:32.838
Sorry, I just...

41:35.014 --> 41:37.016
I just missed you so much.

41:39.148 --> 41:40.062
Hey.

41:44.197 --> 41:45.981
Wait. How did...

41:47.635 --> 41:49.071
How did you grow it out?

41:56.296 --> 41:57.993
Doc, how can all
of this have happened

41:58.037 --> 41:59.212
while we were in the garden?

42:01.997 --> 42:03.216
Unless...

42:03.259 --> 42:06.306
I broke my leg, and
I came back to Purgatory

42:06.349 --> 42:08.700
but I had to retreat
to the homestead.

42:09.614 --> 42:11.964
I did everything I could
to keep it safe for you.

42:16.446 --> 42:18.013
Nicole, wait, just tell me.

42:18.840 --> 42:20.015
How long have I been gone?

42:20.755 --> 42:21.669
Don't you know?

42:25.020 --> 42:26.195
You've been gone...

42:26.979 --> 42:28.241
18 months,

42:29.198 --> 42:30.939
three weeks and four days.

42:33.463 --> 42:34.421
All of you have.
