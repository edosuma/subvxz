00:29.863 --> 00:31.448

Don't you know that thing

00:36.911 --> 00:38.538

00:38.621 --> 00:40.498
Um... You see?

00:41.750 --> 00:43.209
Your dad works way too much.

00:43.293 --> 00:47.672
He doesn't have a second to teach
his own son how to cook.

No, while you got wasted
with your little friends,

-ways for you to make more revenue.
-[calculator beeps]

02:45.498 --> 02:47.125
You know, I was thinking, like,
targeted marketing,

02:47.333 --> 02:49.043
-social media--
-[Erik] Move.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.004
You should do, like, a loyalty program

02:51.087 --> 02:53.173
with a punch card, but it's, like,
in the shape of a taco, so that--

02:53.256 --> 02:54.549
-Coming through.
-[Ana, laughs]

02:54.632 --> 02:57.177
Why you fuckers always fighting

02:57.260 --> 02:58.344
I'm trying to do my job,

02:58.428 --> 02:59.846
but I can't get this mosca
out of the kitchen.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.973
Oh! Did you use a flyswatter?

03:02.056 --> 03:04.142
Oh, good idea. Shoo, fly, don't bother us.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.059
Stop.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.770
But Pop, really you should think
about changing the menu.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.773
You know, like introducing
a new taco of the week.

03:10.857 --> 03:11.816
[in Spanish] Oh, yeah?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.484
Yeah. You should experiment
with new flavors

03:13.651 --> 03:16.279
and introduce seasonal ingredients.
What do you think?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.406
I would, but ever since...

03:18.531 --> 03:20.783
I climbed over the mountains

03:20.867 --> 03:23.077
to cross the border in the dead of night

03:23.661 --> 03:25.538
to build this humble shop,

03:25.622 --> 03:28.625
so my children and their children
could have a better life...

03:29.834 --> 03:31.461
[exhales] I'm tired.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.087
Yes, Pop, preach!

03:33.588 --> 03:34.797
But go for it, if you want to.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.799
-Really?
-Sí.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.594
If you've got the time.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.012
Oh, of course I do. Actually,

03:41.179 --> 03:42.472
I have a really good idea

03:42.764 --> 03:44.724
for a chicken tikka masala taco.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.185
[laughs] Can someone tell this güero

03:47.685 --> 03:49.896
you can't throw trash on a tortilla
and call it a taco?

03:50.396 --> 03:51.606
No, none of my business.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.609
Oh, and Pop, in the meantime,

you have this to hold you over. You know,

03:56.903 --> 03:58.112
what we talked about for the shop.

Don't worry about it, mijo.

-OK. OK,

04:25.014 --> 04:26.224
now this is my business.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.061
without you two regressing
to your 12-year-old beef.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.689
OK, just stop torturing him
with this bullshit.

check your bags when you leave work.

You going to eat that or what?

10:35.676 --> 10:36.802
Hell no! You eat it.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.512
-Then I'll take it.
-Take it.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.306
Wait, so--so you do like it?

10:40.389 --> 10:42.058
Hell no! But it's free.

10:42.391 --> 10:43.893
Maybe I can rinse off the chicken
or something.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.061
Okay, that's it! It's over.

10:45.144 --> 10:45.978
You're done.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.440
Hey, at least give me a real taco
to get rid of this flavor.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.275

10:58.824 --> 11:00.242
You can't leave my mouth like this.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.704
-Give me some radishes or jalapeños?
-I'll give you your radish. Let's go!

This week's chica-no-no is

11:25.309 --> 11:27.144
toxic masculinity!

11:27.228 --> 11:28.062
[in Spanish] You know!

11:28.145 --> 11:29.563
-Those men who want mothers
-Shit!

11:29.647 --> 11:31.565

Ya sabemos...

11:31.649 --> 11:32.483
[grunts]

11:32.566 --> 11:34.276
I'm not your mother,
and you are not my baby.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.611
Not like that.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.739
Yeah boy, stop being a manchild
and get it together,

11:38.823 --> 11:39.657

doing the same, emotionally.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.089
A million dollar smile.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.425
Just give it to her.
Flash it to her, that's right!

11:58.092 --> 12:01.095
That's right, make her fall in love
with you all over again, baby.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.680
Silky smooth.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.933
There you go, silky smooth.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.354
[in Spanish] You alright, man?

12:10.521 --> 12:11.355
Never better.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.690
Everything is awesome.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.025
Hey, how about that Chivas game
last night?

12:15.693 --> 12:16.527
Didn't catch it.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.821
[in Spanish] You didn't watch it?
What kind of Mexican are you?

12:18.904 --> 12:20.781
What, I didn't watch the game
and suddenly I'm not Mexican?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.366
Chris, relax, bro.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.660
Hey, you know what,
I'm more Mexican than all y'all.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.745
[laughs]

12:25.870 --> 12:26.746
Okay, sure.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.372
You're Mexican, güerito.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.498
Oh, you don't think so?

12:31.459 --> 12:32.293
Test me.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.712
OK.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.297
What kind of test?

12:36.380 --> 12:37.256
I don't know, we'll figure it out

12:37.339 --> 12:39.425
right here, right now,
and we'll settle it.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.886
¿Cómo, cómo? Like a Mexican test?

12:41.969 --> 12:43.012
Whatever you want to call it, Chief.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.473
But less talking and more doing.

12:46.098 --> 12:46.932
Bring it on.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.142

Marimar, María la del Barrio,
and María Mercedes, at your service.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.268
Oh! I love all of them.

This place is nice.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.942
I know, right?

17:49.777 --> 17:51.153
Is this the spot your cousin works at?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.739
Ah... No, no. Come on.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.533
No, that's, that's... Spaghetti.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.120
The name of the restaurant
is called Spaghetti?

18:00.370 --> 18:02.372
Yeah! Yeah, they serve Chinese food there.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.458
It's ironic, you know how hipsters are.
[chuckles]

18:04.541 --> 18:06.210
Oh! That's-- that's actually clever,

18:06.293 --> 18:08.003
'cause the Chinese invented spaghetti.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.421
Really?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.590
You see, you're brilliant.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.134
I swear, our baby better have your brains.

Oh yeah, no, I read her

18:19.515 --> 18:21.016

-a girl.
-Boy.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.687
You know what? I'm not playing with you

18:25.771 --> 18:28.273
because gender is a social construct.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.608
-So...
-OK.

Thank you.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.499
Are you crying, güero?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.378
-Is it because  you're not Mexican, güey?
-[chuckles]

18:49.461 --> 18:50.838
Or is the tequila making you cry?

18:50.921 --> 18:53.006
-'Cause that's Mexican.
-[laughs]

18:53.132 --> 18:54.508
It's the onion, fuckfaces.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.218
[Vincente] You know what?
You can pass the test

18:56.301 --> 18:58.137
if you can do a grito like a mariachi.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.764
Well, that's ridiculous, OK?
There's no way I'm gonna--

19:01.974 --> 19:04.268
Ah! Ha! Ha ha!

19:04.434 --> 19:05.894
[laughs]

19:07.104 --> 19:08.856
You kidding? You call that a grito?

19:09.648 --> 19:11.650
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

19:11.984 --> 19:14.611
Now that's a manly grito!

19:14.945 --> 19:15.988
Alright, you're next Felix.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.699
No, I don't really-- We don't do gritos.

19:18.782 --> 19:19.908
Yes, we get it.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.410
You're Venezuelan.

I thought this was supposed
to be a classy place.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.423
Oh shit, you're still chopping onions?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.383
How long can a man take chop--

19:36.466 --> 19:38.468
-[plate clattering]
-Fucking... bastard.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.556
I've told you about leaving the plates
close to the burner

19:42.639 --> 19:44.057
a million times, Felix.

19:44.141 --> 19:44.975
Sorry.

Sorry what?

19:46.894 --> 19:47.728
I'm sorry, Chef.

off the appetizer menu. [laughs]

21:16.858 --> 21:17.693
That's it?

21:18.819 --> 21:20.988

I'm eating for two, so

21:21.154 --> 21:22.489
I'mma be a little hungry after this.

21:22.572 --> 21:23.740
You know what, here.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.288
I read that your body needs
hella calcium right now, so take that.

-So what, you're reading baby books now?
-Yeah.

21:43.885 --> 21:44.845
Oh, you know I love it

21:44.928 --> 21:46.638
when you talk libro to me, girl.

21:46.722 --> 21:50.017

on environmental catastrophe.

when you're picking people
for your bunker.

21:58.608 --> 21:59.985
I already made you a disaster map.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.320
-[chuckles]
-Oh.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.572
Here you go.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.584
This is going pretty OK.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.006
Why is this going pretty OK?

22:22.507 --> 22:24.593
