01:07.913 --> 01:10.448
So, what does Mr. Dawkins
want to talk about?

01:12.451 --> 01:15.920
I don't know. Wouldn't say a word to me.

01:15.954 --> 01:17.889
He has been acting odd lately.

01:17.923 --> 01:21.192
That's because he's an odd duck.

01:21.226 --> 01:24.028
So, what's on your mind, Richard?

01:24.063 --> 01:26.564
Um... not everyone's here yet.

01:28.867 --> 01:32.336
Well, I wager we'll find out soon enough.

01:34.673 --> 01:36.773
Gentlemen, Mrs. Blake.

01:38.776 --> 01:43.046
- It's a pleasure to see you all.
- You as well, Mrs. McKinnon.

01:43.081 --> 01:45.416
So, are you all here to
petition for my removal?

01:45.450 --> 01:47.884
Cecily, heavens, no!

01:47.919 --> 01:49.720
The harbour's never run more smoothly.

01:49.754 --> 01:53.724
I suppose sometimes it does
take a woman to do a man's job.

01:53.758 --> 01:56.993
- Oh! Doesn't he have nerve?
- Her husband hardly in the ground!

01:58.996 --> 02:01.598
Well. Mr. Dawkins?

02:01.632 --> 02:04.400
Why have you gathered us all here?

02:04.435 --> 02:07.070
Could we please eat first? I'm famished.

02:07.105 --> 02:09.405
The first courses are set to arrive.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.742
Could you please get a move on?

02:14.311 --> 02:16.112
Oh, good lord!

02:33.029 --> 02:35.364
His name was Richard Dawkins.

02:35.398 --> 02:37.366
Well, the cause of death looks clear.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.802
His skull is crushed.

02:39.836 --> 02:43.037
And he was killed in
plain view of the others?

02:43.072 --> 02:45.240
His assailants obviously

02:45.275 --> 02:47.709
weren't worried about being seen.

02:47.744 --> 02:50.145
- Sir...
- Oh, good gracious.

02:50.179 --> 02:52.981
Sir, the inspector's on his way.

02:53.015 --> 02:55.216
Really? This was enough
to rouse him from bed?

02:55.251 --> 02:57.218
Well, murder in the dining
room of the Queen's Hotel...

02:57.253 --> 02:59.254
- I should hope so.
- Right.

03:01.123 --> 03:03.724
- Detective.
- Inspector Slorach.

03:03.759 --> 03:07.162
Good lord!

03:07.196 --> 03:10.832
Are you sure you can't cover him up, or...

03:20.609 --> 03:23.511
Get him down to the
morgue and clean this up.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.481
Sir, I miss Inspector Brackenreid.

03:27.516 --> 03:29.950
So do I, George. So do I.

03:34.032 --> 03:35.452
Thank you, Doctor Grace.

03:37.035 --> 03:39.269
- May I take my wife home?
- Mr. Blake, the detective

03:39.303 --> 03:42.606
will want to have a couple of words. Sir?

03:42.640 --> 03:46.476
- This is Mr. Arthur Blake.
- Mr. Blake.

03:46.510 --> 03:48.478
Do you have anything to add

03:48.512 --> 03:52.081
- past the general description that it was two men?
- I'm sorry, no.

03:52.116 --> 03:55.418
Protecting my wife was my only concern.

03:55.453 --> 03:58.288
Mr. Dawkins was a friend of yours?

03:58.322 --> 04:02.592
- A business associate.
- And a friend, Arthur, surely?

04:02.627 --> 04:06.929
I'm Cecily McKinnon, the
Toronto Harbourmaster.

04:06.964 --> 04:09.698
Oh, pleasure.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.934
What was the purpose of tonight's dinner?

04:11.969 --> 04:14.703
No real purpose, we often got together.

04:14.738 --> 04:16.471
Who arranged this meeting?

04:16.505 --> 04:18.507
Mr. Dawkins.

04:18.541 --> 04:22.211
- Ah. Do you have any idea what it was about?
- I don't.

04:22.246 --> 04:25.847
It all unfolded so quickly.

04:25.882 --> 04:28.950
They just went straight
for Richard like madmen.

04:28.985 --> 04:32.721
So he and he alone was the intended target?

04:32.756 --> 04:36.392
- Yes. They paid us no mind.
- Were any words spoken?

04:36.426 --> 04:38.794
Nothing I heard.

04:38.828 --> 04:40.796
They clearly came in here with
the intention of killing him.

04:40.830 --> 04:45.400
You all knew Mr. Dawkins well.
Could there be a reason for this?

04:51.941 --> 04:53.909
And nobody will say anything?

04:53.943 --> 04:56.977
They all recounted the
events, not much more.

04:58.914 --> 05:01.382
- Dawkins was the target.
- So it would appear.

05:01.417 --> 05:04.752
No money was stolen, not a word was spoken.

05:04.787 --> 05:09.223
- So it was an assassination.
- Possibly an assassination,

05:09.257 --> 05:11.926
possibly something more. A message.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.161
Exactly. We best get on this.

05:14.196 --> 05:17.097
A murder in a fine Toronto establishment
does not reflect well on us.

05:17.132 --> 05:19.666
- Of course.
- Oh, and Murdoch, I've noticed

05:19.701 --> 05:22.602
- you have yet to request any time off.
- Sir?

05:22.637 --> 05:25.339
- You are getting married?
- Yes.

05:25.373 --> 05:29.243
- You haven't picked a date yet?
- Oh, don't worry,

05:29.277 --> 05:31.345
- it won't be on a work day.
- Oh, Murdoch,

05:31.379 --> 05:34.381
you gotta make an event out of these
things. As my wayward wife used to say,

05:34.415 --> 05:37.050
there's more to life than murder.

05:42.457 --> 05:44.791
My practice keeps me quite busy, Ms. Haile,

05:44.826 --> 05:46.792
and I am getting married.

05:46.827 --> 05:48.794
Of course.

05:48.829 --> 05:51.331
But I do think that we can accomplish this,

05:51.365 --> 05:53.599
especially with the
assistance of women like you.

05:53.633 --> 05:55.801
Well, I doubt that you need me.

05:55.836 --> 05:57.737
That's where you're wrong.

05:57.771 --> 05:59.739
You are a woman of great achievement.

05:59.773 --> 06:02.441
And more than my share of scandal.

06:02.476 --> 06:05.778
I can look past that.

06:05.812 --> 06:08.714
You do agree that women are
deserving of the right to vote?

06:08.749 --> 06:11.484
Of course.
- I intend to see

06:11.518 --> 06:14.387
that women's suffrage is
achieved in my lifetime.

06:14.421 --> 06:19.057
And I can't do that without
people like you at my side.

06:19.092 --> 06:21.960
Add your voice, Dr. Ogden.

06:21.995 --> 06:23.962
You do believe in justice, don't you?

06:23.997 --> 06:26.298
And what is more just

06:26.332 --> 06:30.369
than granting women the right to franchise?

06:33.773 --> 06:35.740
I appreciate this, Mrs. Dawkins.

06:35.775 --> 06:38.843
The loss of your husband
must be a terrible blow.

06:38.878 --> 06:41.145
Thank you, but please be brief.

06:41.179 --> 06:43.281
Yes. Yes, of course.

06:43.315 --> 06:46.083
Your husband owned a business
down by the Toronto docks?

06:46.118 --> 06:48.853
- Yes, a chandlery.
- Right.

06:48.888 --> 06:52.689
And did he often have dinner
with his fellow merchants?

06:52.724 --> 06:55.759
No, he didn't much care for them.

06:55.794 --> 06:58.629
Hmm. And why did he set up this dinner?

06:58.663 --> 07:01.265
I have no idea.

07:01.300 --> 07:05.102
Do you have any idea what
he may have wanted to speak

07:05.137 --> 07:07.805
- to his fellow merchants about?
- I don't know.

07:07.839 --> 07:11.207
Mrs. Dawkins,

07:11.242 --> 07:15.245
the men who killed your husband
very clearly targeted him.

07:15.279 --> 07:17.481
Richard was a quiet man.

07:17.515 --> 07:19.616
Most people hardly gave
him the time of day.

07:19.651 --> 07:22.820
And yet, someone wanted him dead.

07:22.854 --> 07:26.823
Could it have anything
to do with this dinner?

07:26.857 --> 07:28.891
Detective Murdoch, if you want the truth,

07:28.926 --> 07:31.061
Richard was considering
selling the chandlery

07:31.095 --> 07:33.296
and getting away from
the waterfront altogether.

07:33.331 --> 07:35.332
Why is that?

07:35.366 --> 07:37.334
I don't know. But
something was troubling him.

07:37.368 --> 07:41.504
In the last week, he wasn't the same man.

07:41.538 --> 07:45.842
Alright. Do you have any
idea why that could be?

07:49.045 --> 07:51.814
Who was he planning to sell to?

07:51.849 --> 07:54.116
Mr. Lionel Jeffries.

07:58.088 --> 08:00.822
I once considered a seaman's life.

08:00.857 --> 08:02.824
- Did you, George?
- The smell of the salt air,

08:02.859 --> 08:05.260
the sound of the crashing waves,

08:05.295 --> 08:07.463
the bracing wind in your hair...

08:07.497 --> 08:10.899
No doubt a result of your
Newfoundland upbringing, George.

08:10.933 --> 08:14.136
No, I wouldn't say,
sir. Why do you say that?

08:14.170 --> 08:16.705
Oh, I don't know...

08:16.739 --> 08:18.707
Doesn't the thought of a
rousing nautical adventure

08:18.741 --> 08:20.709
appeal to you?

08:20.743 --> 08:22.844
I have my share of
adventures, thank you, George.

08:22.879 --> 08:25.279
- Mr. Jeffries.
- Detective Murdoch.

08:25.314 --> 08:27.281
Have you any further information?

08:27.316 --> 08:29.751
Unfortunately, no. Only more questions.

08:29.785 --> 08:32.453
Go ahead.

08:32.488 --> 08:34.422
You expressed interest
in purchasing Mr. Dawkins'

08:34.456 --> 08:37.457
- chandlery prior to his murder?
- I did.

08:37.493 --> 08:39.394
By all accounts it was
a successful business.

08:39.428 --> 08:42.730
- Why would he care to sell it?
- I have no idea.

08:42.764 --> 08:45.433
I see.

08:45.467 --> 08:47.701
Mrs. Dawkins mentioned

08:47.736 --> 08:49.770
that her husband had been acting strangely.

08:49.804 --> 08:51.972
Do you know anything about that?

08:52.007 --> 08:54.041
No, I don't.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.376
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm a busy man.

09:04.718 --> 09:07.987
Your inspector was here some
months ago. I'm terribly sorry

09:08.022 --> 09:10.490
- about what happened to him.
- As am I.

09:10.525 --> 09:14.227
Did he tell you what
he'd been investigating?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.430
There had been some
vandalism, hooliganism...

09:16.464 --> 09:18.432
Nothing much, really.

09:18.466 --> 09:20.434
Just men too long on boats

09:20.468 --> 09:22.735
- letting off steam.
- Indeed.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.904
A dangerous place for a woman to work.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.839
That may be.

09:26.874 --> 09:30.476
But I've had little
trouble down here so far.

09:32.479 --> 09:35.096
Did the merchants tell you
what they were meeting about?

09:35.116 --> 09:38.350
Oh, sir. I am merely the harbourmaster.

09:38.385 --> 09:40.919
I log the movements of the ships
entering and leaving Toronto.

09:40.954 --> 09:42.654
What they do with their businesses here

09:42.689 --> 09:46.192
- is of little concern to me.
- Yet you were at their dinner.

09:46.226 --> 09:48.894
Yes, I had been invited.

09:48.928 --> 09:51.197
I suppose they were
taking pity on the widow.

09:53.700 --> 09:56.868
Detective, are you sure you're
looking in the right direction?

09:56.903 --> 09:59.938
- How do you mean?
- Contrary to what others

09:59.973 --> 10:03.308
may tell you, Richard Dawkins was no saint.

10:03.342 --> 10:06.211
And that was the reason for his death?

10:06.245 --> 10:09.848
Prostitutes and their procurers

10:09.882 --> 10:13.050
are not angels.

10:13.085 --> 10:15.353
But then, I very much doubt
I have to tell you that.

10:22.294 --> 10:24.295
Heads up!

10:26.798 --> 10:29.199
Pass it back over here, why don't you?

10:33.005 --> 10:35.472
- Sir.
- I see them.

10:35.507 --> 10:38.709
Nothing will be accomplished
by speaking to them, George.

10:38.744 --> 10:40.745
Not yet.

10:40.779 --> 10:43.580
Sir, these are the ones
who did in the Inspector.

10:43.615 --> 10:45.582
Allegedly.

10:45.617 --> 10:47.584
Tell Jackson to stay down here.

10:47.619 --> 10:49.586
Couple of bloody coppers!

10:49.621 --> 10:52.222
Let's let them know that we're here now

10:52.257 --> 10:54.358
and we're not planning on leaving.

10:54.392 --> 10:57.161
The injuries inflicted upon Mr. Dawkins

10:57.195 --> 10:59.729
are similar to those of the Inspector.

10:59.764 --> 11:01.931
How do you mean? The same weapons?

11:01.966 --> 11:04.400
I can't be certain, but they are similar.

11:04.434 --> 11:06.569
Hardly a definitive link.

11:06.603 --> 11:09.572
I would have to agree.

11:09.606 --> 11:12.108
- William!
- Julia!

11:12.143 --> 11:14.443
Oh! I will be ready in a moment.

11:14.478 --> 11:18.281
The right to vote this is so exciting!

11:18.315 --> 11:21.284
Don't tell me you've dragged
her into this, as well?

11:21.318 --> 11:24.887
Julia, please do try
to stay out of trouble.

11:24.921 --> 11:29.058
Police detective's
bride-to-be behind bars?

11:29.092 --> 11:32.027
My loving fiancé would break me out.

11:32.062 --> 11:34.029
I'm simply reminding you that the law

11:34.064 --> 11:36.832
is not as forward-thinking as you are.

11:36.866 --> 11:40.069
Then perhaps the law needs a little help.

11:47.577 --> 11:50.044
Good day.

11:50.079 --> 11:53.047
Hello there.

11:53.082 --> 11:55.750
And a nice day to you as well, sir.

11:55.784 --> 11:57.686
Shut up!

12:41.435 --> 12:43.401
Sir!

12:43.436 --> 12:45.504
It's alright, Jackson. No need.

12:48.307 --> 12:50.275
Who did this to you?

12:50.309 --> 12:52.978
They struck me from behind, sir.

12:53.013 --> 12:56.815
- The manner of weapon?
- They just used

12:56.850 --> 12:58.951
their boots and fists, sir.

12:58.985 --> 13:02.120
"They". How many were there?

13:02.155 --> 13:05.090
I don't know. Certainly more than one.

13:05.124 --> 13:08.427
And no one saw anything?

13:08.461 --> 13:10.963
Well, there were people down there, sir,

13:10.997 --> 13:13.098
but no-one helped me.

13:13.132 --> 13:15.733
You'd think someone would help a policeman.

13:15.768 --> 13:18.903
Yes. Do you recall

13:18.938 --> 13:20.905
anything out of the ordinary?

13:20.940 --> 13:25.543
I thought I heard a noise, a voice, but...

13:25.578 --> 13:29.981
Constable Jackman... Jackson. How are you?

13:30.015 --> 13:32.249
Ooh, not well.

13:32.284 --> 13:34.752
- Detective.
- Inspector.

13:34.787 --> 13:36.754
Constable Jackson doesn't seem to recall

13:36.789 --> 13:38.756
anything about his assailants.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.758
Is there any reason for the beating?

13:40.793 --> 13:42.760
It would appear someone doesn't want us

13:42.795 --> 13:44.762
down by the docks.

13:44.797 --> 13:48.932
Rest up, Jackson, and, um...

13:48.966 --> 13:52.169
... if you recall anything...

13:52.204 --> 13:54.938
Yes, sir.

13:54.972 --> 13:58.008
- What the devil is that?
- This?

13:58.042 --> 14:00.143
This is your lucky day, Jackson. Kaposzta.

14:00.178 --> 14:02.145
Made with my mother's loving hand.

14:02.180 --> 14:04.181
You get a couple of those in your belly,

14:04.216 --> 14:06.183
you're right as rain in no time.

14:09.420 --> 14:12.789
And the right to vote is within our grasp.

14:12.824 --> 14:16.760
Not sometime this century, not in 50 years,

14:16.794 --> 14:18.762
but now.

14:18.796 --> 14:22.565
Together, we can change
the course of history.

14:25.976 --> 14:29.245
Strong words. I wish I had your confidence.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.081
Well, we are nothing without
confidence, or precedent.

14:32.115 --> 14:35.251
- Precedent?
- Oh! Pardon me.

14:35.286 --> 14:37.987
Kathleen, this is Dr. Julia
Ogden and Dr. Emily Grace.

14:38.021 --> 14:40.022
Pleased to meet you. Doctors?

14:40.056 --> 14:42.024
Yes, that's right.

14:42.058 --> 14:44.226
Women of considerable accomplishment.

14:44.261 --> 14:46.228
Well, surely you must believe that

14:46.263 --> 14:47.863
you are of sufficient intellectual capacity

14:47.898 --> 14:49.865
to be deserving of the ballot box.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.001
- Yes, of course.
- More than many men.

14:52.035 --> 14:54.369
Yeah, well, most of us are.

14:54.404 --> 14:56.571
But it's our job to try
and convince them of that.

14:56.606 --> 14:59.308
When I speak of precedent, are you aware

14:59.342 --> 15:01.310
that women of both
Australia and New Zealand

15:01.344 --> 15:03.545
have had the right to
vote for almost ten years?

15:03.579 --> 15:05.547
Well, I'd say it's time we caught up

15:05.581 --> 15:07.882
- with our antipodal sisters.
- We are requesting

15:07.917 --> 15:10.652
an audience with the premier.
He's a reasonable man.

15:10.687 --> 15:13.788
To that end, we need to continue to gather

15:13.823 --> 15:16.490
as many signatures as we
can supporting the cause

15:16.525 --> 15:19.427
of women's suffrage. Can we count on you?

15:19.461 --> 15:22.663
- Of course.
- Thank you.

15:22.698 --> 15:24.665
I want you and Henry to
head down to the docks.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.901
Are you sure that's such a wise idea,

15:26.936 --> 15:28.803
considering what happened
to Constable Jackson?

15:28.837 --> 15:31.706
Uh, the Inspector makes a point, sir.

15:31.740 --> 15:34.775
Henry, if you don't feel you can handle it,

15:34.810 --> 15:36.877
then perhaps I should send
someone else down who can.

15:36.911 --> 15:38.879
- Let's go, Henry.
- Oh, and George,

15:38.913 --> 15:40.881
feel free to let the O'Sheas know

15:40.915 --> 15:42.883
that we're not planning
on leaving anytime soon.

15:42.917 --> 15:47.587
- Sir.
- Thank you.

16:02.269 --> 16:05.638
Here, Detective.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.975
Are those the two that
attacked the inspector?

16:09.009 --> 16:13.145
- Allegedly.
- Oh, of course. Hmm.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.415
And they're behind the attacks of Dawkins

16:15.449 --> 16:17.750
- and Constable Jackson?
- I don't know that.

16:17.784 --> 16:20.019
But it stands to reason

16:20.053 --> 16:23.555
that either they or someone
close to them did it.

16:23.590 --> 16:27.960
Brutal, unprovoked assaults
seem to be their stock-in-trade.

16:30.230 --> 16:33.399
Where you goin'?

16:33.433 --> 16:36.067
To speak to someone who may be
able to shed some light on this.

16:45.111 --> 16:47.112
- Inspector?
- Murdoch.

16:48.748 --> 16:50.415
Well, that's quite good.

16:50.449 --> 16:52.417
You think?

16:52.451 --> 16:55.420
I'm having trouble with my clouds.

16:55.454 --> 16:58.089
So, what brings you here?

16:58.124 --> 17:00.425
Sir, there's been a murder,

17:00.459 --> 17:03.761
- linked to the docks.
- I'm of no use to you.

17:03.796 --> 17:06.564
I know as much as you about
what goes on down there.

17:06.598 --> 17:09.199
What were you investigating there?

17:09.233 --> 17:11.234
I was looking into complaints

17:11.269 --> 17:13.237
about hooligans disturbing the peace,

17:13.271 --> 17:15.239
refusing to leave stores
and businesses when asked.

17:15.272 --> 17:18.476
That's all there was to it. Oh...

17:18.510 --> 17:21.579
- Oh. If you like, I can...
- No bother.

17:24.882 --> 17:28.218
Sir, Constable Jackson was
attacked down by the docks

17:28.252 --> 17:32.789
and we believe it was the O'Sheas.

17:32.824 --> 17:35.025
Can't help ya.

17:35.060 --> 17:37.027
Sir, any information you could give...

17:37.062 --> 17:39.063
I'm not a policeman
anymore, I can't help ya.

17:41.065 --> 17:43.600
Sir, I'm speaking about the
men that nearly killed you.

17:43.634 --> 17:45.802
Well, they didn't.

17:45.837 --> 17:48.071
And we don't know it was them.

17:50.107 --> 17:52.476
Have you given any thought
as to why you were attacked?

17:52.510 --> 17:54.310
Someone at the docks

17:54.345 --> 17:56.279
didn't take to me sniffing
around there, I suppose.

17:56.313 --> 17:59.682
- And that someone?
- Murdoch,

17:59.716 --> 18:02.251
I don't know any more
than I've told you already

18:02.286 --> 18:04.220
and I'm done with this whole business.

18:04.254 --> 18:08.657
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd
like to get back to my clouds.

18:08.692 --> 18:11.861
Yes, of course.

18:18.502 --> 18:22.137
Good day, sir.

18:24.508 --> 18:27.743
So, were you able to talk sense to him?

18:27.777 --> 18:29.211
You know your husband.

18:29.245 --> 18:31.413
I thought I did.

18:31.447 --> 18:33.581
He's not the same man, Detective.

18:33.616 --> 18:36.218
Well, he's suffered a grievous injury.

18:36.252 --> 18:39.287
From which he's recovered...
at least physically.

18:39.322 --> 18:43.158
Detective, he just sits there
like a lump. He won't retire,

18:43.192 --> 18:46.861
he won't return to work.
He won't do anything.

18:46.896 --> 18:49.463
It's as if the beating
took the life out of him.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.202
And what about respecting
the Inspector's privacy?

18:55.237 --> 18:58.540
Mrs. Brackenreid is concerned as well.

18:58.574 --> 19:00.909
Well, what is it you want me to do?

19:00.943 --> 19:03.044
I'm not sure.

19:03.078 --> 19:06.847
But the person I spoke
with is not the man I know.

19:06.881 --> 19:10.584
It would mean a great deal to
me if you would speak with him.

19:10.618 --> 19:13.421
Of course, William.

19:13.455 --> 19:16.257
This is a lovely
neighbourhood, don't you think?

19:16.291 --> 19:18.259
Oh, yes. Yes, very nice.

19:18.293 --> 19:20.661
But far too expensive, I'd wager.

19:28.502 --> 19:30.537
We don't want you down here.

19:30.572 --> 19:32.539
Well, we're not interested
in what you want, sir.

19:32.574 --> 19:35.542
"Sir"! Copper here thinks I'm a gentleman.

19:35.576 --> 19:37.343
No matter what you think, the waterfront

19:37.378 --> 19:39.879
is still under the jurisdiction
of the Toronto Constabulary.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.248
George.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.685
Lad! You there! Hey, come...

19:48.021 --> 19:49.989
Go lad, go! Run, boy!

19:50.023 --> 19:52.524
Don't let those wretched coppers catch you!

19:52.559 --> 19:55.227
Out the way!

19:56.730 --> 19:59.932
Sweet mother!

19:59.967 --> 20:04.503
- You alright, George?
- Yes.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.572
- Thanks tremendously, Higgins.
- Well, I did point him out.

20:06.607 --> 20:09.475
Come on.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.179
You lot can stay as long as you like.

20:14.214 --> 20:18.550
You're obviously as
useless as tits on a bull.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.424
I'd been investigating reports

20:26.458 --> 20:28.693
of hooliganism down the dockyards.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.996
I arrested a number of dockworkers

20:31.030 --> 20:35.133
and invited them to spend
a night in the cells.

20:35.167 --> 20:38.603
Were these two men among those you took in?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.204
One of them was.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.373
Mick O'Shea. The one on the left.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.975
And do you know Mr. O'Shea well?

20:45.010 --> 20:47.345
I'd had run-ins with him before.

20:47.379 --> 20:51.415
And was Mr. O'Shea your attacker?

20:51.450 --> 20:53.651
I believe so.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.586
No further questions.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.588
You "believe so".

20:57.623 --> 21:00.024
Do you know so?

21:00.058 --> 21:02.626
Could your attacker not have been anyone

21:02.661 --> 21:04.628
of a number of men that
you've come into contact with

21:04.663 --> 21:06.630
over the years?

21:06.665 --> 21:08.666
In fact, your sworn statements say

21:08.700 --> 21:11.869
you have no recollection
of the night in question.

21:11.903 --> 21:15.539
So are you lying now,
or were you lying then?

21:21.445 --> 21:24.147
Oh, well. Doesn't matter,
now. It's over and done with.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.149
And I'm better off out of it.

21:26.184 --> 21:28.785
Are you?

21:31.055 --> 21:33.089
Did Murdoch send you here?

21:33.123 --> 21:36.059
He's concerned about you.

21:36.093 --> 21:38.127
He just wants me back on the force.

21:38.162 --> 21:41.263
Well, if that's where you're
meant to be, of course he does.

21:41.298 --> 21:44.433
I thank you both for your concern,

21:44.467 --> 21:46.869
but I'm quite content with my lot.

21:46.904 --> 21:49.371
Content or frightened?

21:51.974 --> 21:53.942
It's not the same world out there.

21:53.976 --> 21:56.278
There's no respect for the law anymore.

21:56.313 --> 21:59.114
So I don't care to be a part of it.

21:59.148 --> 22:01.116
You didn't answer the question.

22:01.150 --> 22:04.619
I'm neither. I'm just
accepting of the way it is.

22:04.653 --> 22:08.423
So the men who attacked you win.

22:17.166 --> 22:19.201
As long as you're content.

22:24.373 --> 22:26.040
So when are you marrying?

22:26.074 --> 22:28.710
- Soon.
- Good.

22:28.744 --> 22:32.480
- You know what's a shame?
- If he wasn't a bloody papist,

22:32.514 --> 22:35.182
they would have given him my job.

22:43.124 --> 22:45.392
From what we can gather,
the O'Sheas rule the roost.

22:45.426 --> 22:47.527
Questions about them go unanswered.

22:47.562 --> 22:49.529
People are afraid of them.

22:49.564 --> 22:51.632
Were you able to find anything to suggest

22:51.666 --> 22:53.533
that Mr. Dawkins had enemies?

22:53.568 --> 22:55.469
Sir, no one will speak two words to us.

22:55.503 --> 23:00.106
- So nothing?
- I'm afraid not.

23:00.141 --> 23:02.508
What is it?

23:11.218 --> 23:13.486
Constabulary. Move aside, please.

23:14.889 --> 23:15.923
Lads.

23:34.100 --> 23:35.800
Have you a cause of death, Doctor Grace?

23:35.903 --> 23:37.870
The most probable cause of
death is, of course, drowning.

23:38.775 --> 23:42.044
Fell into the water, got
tangled in a fisherman's net.

23:42.078 --> 23:44.646
She has some unusual dental work.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.781
Lead fillings.

23:46.815 --> 23:48.949
They haven't been used
in North America in years.

23:48.984 --> 23:50.951
Hmm.

23:50.986 --> 23:52.887
- A recent arrival?
- Perhaps.

23:52.921 --> 23:55.390
Look at the condition of her clothing.

23:55.424 --> 23:58.226
- A vagrant?
- Could be.

23:58.260 --> 24:00.595
Or she could have stumbled
into the water drunk,

24:00.629 --> 24:02.596
or she could have decided to end it all...

24:02.630 --> 24:04.598
No need to speculate at this point, Doctor,

24:04.632 --> 24:07.267
- all I need is a time of death.
- You'll have it.

24:21.549 --> 24:25.219
City Morgue, Dr. Emily Grace.

24:25.253 --> 24:28.855
Today?

24:28.889 --> 24:31.891
Of course, I can come.

24:31.926 --> 24:34.027
Yes, I know where Queen's Park is.

24:34.061 --> 24:37.663
In an hour.

24:37.698 --> 24:39.699
A dead woman?

24:39.734 --> 24:41.801
Yes. She was found yesterday.

24:41.836 --> 24:44.337
- Was she from down here?
- I don't know.

24:44.371 --> 24:45.772
Well, do we know who she is?

24:45.806 --> 24:47.774
No-one's come forward to claim her,

24:47.808 --> 24:49.976
and no-one matching her description

24:50.010 --> 24:52.911
was reported missing.

24:52.946 --> 24:56.115
- A fallen woman, then?
- Perhaps.

24:56.149 --> 24:58.551
Do you have something
to add, Mrs. McKinnon?

24:58.585 --> 25:00.553
I shouldn't.

25:00.587 --> 25:03.055
Please.

25:03.089 --> 25:07.793
Mr. Dawkin's association with
Doxies was more than mere rumour.

25:07.827 --> 25:10.695
I had heard that he'd been rough with them.

25:10.730 --> 25:12.697
You could have told me this before.

25:12.732 --> 25:14.699
Yes, I should have.

25:14.734 --> 25:17.169
And now that a woman is dead,
I deeply regret that I didn't.

25:17.203 --> 25:19.872
But perhaps this is the
reason he was murdered there is

25:19.906 --> 25:24.208
- a rough justice down here.
- Justice is the Constabulary's domain.

25:24.333 --> 25:27.435
Yes, of course.

25:27.470 --> 25:30.238
I, um...

25:32.272 --> 25:34.108
I took the liberty of inquiring.

25:34.142 --> 25:38.279
You are a single man, are you not?

25:38.313 --> 25:40.281
I'm engaged to be married.

25:40.315 --> 25:42.416
Oh...

25:42.450 --> 25:44.418
When will that be?

25:44.452 --> 25:47.421
We have yet to set a date.

25:47.455 --> 25:51.492
Oh, I see. Oh, well...

25:51.526 --> 25:53.961
I hope the lucky lady doesn't dally.

26:00.702 --> 26:03.637
Why are you concerning me with this?

26:03.671 --> 26:06.507
I'm terribly sorry to
bring this up, Mrs. Dawkins,

26:06.541 --> 26:08.975
but it's been suggested
to me by a number of people

26:09.010 --> 26:13.380
that your husband was...
less than honourable.

26:13.494 --> 26:15.462
What do you mean by that?

26:15.496 --> 26:18.098
He was unfaithful.

26:20.134 --> 26:22.568
If that was the case, he
got exactly what he deserved.

26:22.603 --> 26:25.972
And unless you have something more to
offer than these terrible accusations,

26:26.007 --> 26:28.975
I will have to ask you
to leave my establishment.

26:35.516 --> 26:37.483
I see you've foregone your husband's wish

26:37.518 --> 26:39.619
to sell this place.

26:39.653 --> 26:42.555
My husband's wishes don't
matter anymore now, do they?

26:42.589 --> 26:45.758
He's dead.

26:52.165 --> 26:55.434
Mr. Foster, I'm Margaret Haile.

26:55.468 --> 26:57.569
- Could we have a word, please?
- Of course, ladies.

26:57.603 --> 26:59.571
To what do I owe the pleasure?

26:59.605 --> 27:01.806
We would like you to present
the premier with this petition.

27:01.841 --> 27:03.808
- What's this?
- It is an opportunity

27:03.843 --> 27:06.144
for you to establish
yourself as a forward-thinker.

27:06.178 --> 27:08.146
We're asking that you
extend suffrage to all

27:08.180 --> 27:11.650
during the next round
of provincial elections.

27:11.684 --> 27:15.887
This is an impressive
list of names, Ms. Haile.

27:15.922 --> 27:19.424
Dr. Julia Ogden... another doctor.

27:19.458 --> 27:21.725
Dr. Emily Grace,

27:21.760 --> 27:24.395
city of Toronto coroner.

27:24.430 --> 27:27.465
- Would one of you ladies...
- I am Dr. Emily Grace, sir.

27:27.499 --> 27:29.467
Shouldn't you be attending to your duties,

27:29.501 --> 27:31.969
or is the fact that
you're employed not enough?

27:32.003 --> 27:34.038
My duties are being well-attended to, sir.

27:34.073 --> 27:36.540
We are here to petition
for a woman's right to...

27:36.575 --> 27:39.543
Good day, ladies. I
have no interest in this.

27:39.578 --> 27:42.112
This is a civilized province

27:42.146 --> 27:46.750
and will continue to be governed
only by those with a level head.

27:56.827 --> 27:58.995
Words on a piece of paper are useless.

27:59.029 --> 28:01.364
Then what do you suggest?

28:01.399 --> 28:04.468
A public protest, right in front
of the provincial legislature.

28:04.502 --> 28:06.470
Julia, are you sure?

28:06.504 --> 28:08.472
No one will listen if
we don't make a sound.

28:08.506 --> 28:10.940
- I'm not sure it's a wise idea.
- It may not be.

28:10.975 --> 28:14.777
But what better way to wipe
the smirk off their faces?

28:19.449 --> 28:21.417
A stick in the mud?

28:21.451 --> 28:24.420
Is that any way to refer
to your future husband?

28:24.454 --> 28:27.656
And I'll desist as long as
you stop acting like one.

28:27.690 --> 28:30.659
I'm only suggesting that a public protest

28:30.693 --> 28:32.661
could result in you being jailed.

28:32.695 --> 28:35.030
You're not trying to stop me, are you?

28:35.064 --> 28:37.366
I doubt very much there
would be any point to that.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.368
- No.
- I'm simply trying to

28:39.402 --> 28:41.370
alert you to...
- Shh.

28:41.404 --> 28:43.404
Murdoch... Oh! Dr. Ogden.

28:43.439 --> 28:46.074
- Inspector.
- Planning your nuptials, I see.

28:46.109 --> 28:49.811
Ah! On police time?

28:56.052 --> 28:59.987
Well, don't let me stop you.

29:07.062 --> 29:09.697
He's a lovely man.

29:09.731 --> 29:11.766
- Yes, of
course. - Mm-hmm.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.502
How was your conversation
with Inspector Brackenreid?

29:14.537 --> 29:17.071
I think he's scared, William.

29:17.105 --> 29:20.207
I think he's afraid to
face the O'Sheas again.

29:20.241 --> 29:23.576
Detective! I have something for you.

29:23.610 --> 29:25.611
The presence of live
lice in her hair indicates

29:25.646 --> 29:28.347
she has been dead less than 48 hours.

29:28.382 --> 29:31.685
- Roughly the same time as Mr. Dawkins.
- Yes.

29:31.719 --> 29:33.687
Could you hazard a before or after?

29:33.721 --> 29:35.689
I could, Detective. I believe she died

29:35.723 --> 29:37.923
- the night before he did.
- Hmm.

29:37.957 --> 29:42.395
And note these bruises.

29:42.429 --> 29:44.397
Are they pre-
or post-mortem?

29:44.431 --> 29:46.899
My next task.

29:46.933 --> 29:48.934
No one's gonna tell us anything.

29:48.968 --> 29:51.370
Henry, why do you always have
to be such a negative Nelly?

29:51.405 --> 29:53.439
Just calling it like it is.

29:53.473 --> 29:55.007
- George!
- What is it?

29:55.041 --> 29:57.943
- It's that little bugger.
- You're right!

29:57.977 --> 30:02.247
- Little scallywag.
- Hey, you! Lad! Come here!

30:02.281 --> 30:04.282
Hey!

30:15.060 --> 30:17.028
You want him?

30:17.062 --> 30:20.665
Hand him over.

30:20.700 --> 30:24.502
Tell us when you want us to
do your work for you again.

30:27.072 --> 30:29.506
Come on, lad.

30:36.715 --> 30:38.682
- I didn't steal anything.
- I saw you!

30:38.717 --> 30:41.786
- Then where is it?
- I saw you pick a man's pocket

30:41.820 --> 30:43.787
- before I caught you.
- You didn't catch me.

30:43.857 --> 30:47.193
Those other men did. I
was getting away from you.

30:47.227 --> 30:49.195
Mm. He's right about that, George.

30:49.229 --> 30:51.731
- Higgins!
- Well, he was.

30:51.766 --> 30:56.436
So, I didn't take anything.
You didn't catch me.

30:56.470 --> 30:59.138
- Can I go home?
- No, you can't go home!

30:59.173 --> 31:02.608
You're a pickpocket and a thief! Now...

31:02.642 --> 31:06.045
Have you seen anything funny
going on down at the docks?

31:06.079 --> 31:08.047
I said, have you seen
anything funny going on

31:08.081 --> 31:10.082
down at the docks?

31:10.117 --> 31:12.351
Just you trying to catch me.

31:12.385 --> 31:16.022
Oh, Higgins! But... that
is the height of sauciness!

31:16.056 --> 31:19.224
Get up! You, unbelievable... Get up!

31:19.258 --> 31:21.794
What are you doing?

31:21.828 --> 31:23.796
Well, I might not be able to catch a child,

31:23.830 --> 31:25.798
but I can throw one in
jail. Higgins, thanks again

31:25.832 --> 31:28.334
for your tremendous help.

31:30.269 --> 31:32.338
- Dr. Grace.
- Detective.

31:32.372 --> 31:34.706
- What have you?
- It's troubling.

31:34.740 --> 31:36.041
It often is.

31:36.075 --> 31:38.877
After the swelling went
down, I was able to detect

31:38.911 --> 31:42.347
lacerations and bone bruising
on her wrists and ankles.

31:42.381 --> 31:45.917
She was manacled for
some time before she was

31:45.952 --> 31:49.087
- thrown into the water.
- I see.

31:49.121 --> 31:52.289
The lacerations suggest she
struggled before she died.

31:52.324 --> 31:54.659
Well, that doesn't sound like

31:54.693 --> 31:57.228
an accidental drowning at all, does it?

32:20.661 --> 32:23.495
- Thomas...
- Margaret.

32:23.530 --> 32:26.465
Thomas, are you alright?

32:26.499 --> 32:28.968
- I'm fine.
- Fine?

32:29.002 --> 32:30.870
Is this your life now?

32:30.904 --> 32:34.139
Watering the plants, waiting for death?

32:34.174 --> 32:36.943
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
That is not what I'm doing.

32:36.977 --> 32:40.512
In fact, I'm thinking we
should move back to England.

32:40.547 --> 32:43.682
You'd like Yorkshire.
The boys would like it.

32:43.716 --> 32:45.917
I'm not moving to Yorkshire!

32:45.952 --> 32:47.919
I'm raising our sons in Canada.

32:47.954 --> 32:50.922
It's their home. Our home.

32:50.957 --> 32:53.492
And you're running away from it.

32:53.526 --> 32:55.827
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

32:55.861 --> 32:59.731
What happened to the man I
married, all piss and vinegar?

32:59.765 --> 33:01.733
It's not all about piss and vinegar.

33:01.767 --> 33:04.235
It's about keeping you safe.
Protecting Bobby and John.

33:04.269 --> 33:06.237
We don't need protection.

33:06.271 --> 33:08.840
I was in the hospital
three months, Margaret.

33:08.874 --> 33:10.842
I told myself that if I got out,

33:10.876 --> 33:12.843
I would never again put my family at risk.

33:12.877 --> 33:16.114
- I intend to keep that promise.
- In exchange for what?

33:18.117 --> 33:21.219
Do you want this to be
the rest of your life?

33:21.253 --> 33:24.722
If it means keeping my family safe.

33:24.756 --> 33:28.659
Your family will be
fine with or without you.

33:28.693 --> 33:33.196
But we won't be fine
with you as you are now.

33:33.231 --> 33:35.398
We want the old you back.

33:38.069 --> 33:41.839
Besides, you're not some poncey painter.

33:43.875 --> 33:46.709
I thought I was quite good.

33:46.744 --> 33:49.513
You're a policeman, Thomas.

33:49.547 --> 33:52.749
Don't turn into an old man on our account.

34:00.191 --> 34:02.158
We're looking for the Blackpool residence.

34:02.192 --> 34:04.160
Supposed to pick up an icebox.

34:04.194 --> 34:06.162
Do you know whereabouts they live?

34:06.196 --> 34:09.398
Oh, yes, of course. It's just, uh,
down the street, and then a right.

34:09.431 --> 34:11.801
Well thank you kindly, ma'am.

34:11.835 --> 34:14.370
- Yes, absolutely...
- Margaret!

34:14.404 --> 34:17.639
- Get back here!
- I'm sorry, excuse me.

34:17.675 --> 34:20.509
Thomas!

34:20.543 --> 34:23.245
- Is everything alright?
- What did they want?

34:23.280 --> 34:25.447
They were just asking for directions.

34:30.587 --> 34:32.588
Why, Thomas? What's wrong?

34:32.621 --> 34:35.190
Nothing.

34:48.637 --> 34:50.706
Both Mr. Richard Dawkins and our Jane Doe

34:50.739 --> 34:52.706
were found murdered. Both of their deaths

34:52.741 --> 34:54.775
are connected by the Toronto waterfront.

34:54.810 --> 34:57.579
- I see.
- Now, it's possible

34:57.613 --> 34:59.880
that our Jane Doe was a prostitute

34:59.915 --> 35:02.149
that Richard Dawkins procured.

35:02.184 --> 35:05.253
- Do you think he killed her?
- Possibly.

35:05.287 --> 35:08.422
But both Mick and Tim O'Shea
have been arrested several times

35:08.456 --> 35:10.424
for violent crimes down by the docks.

35:10.458 --> 35:12.426
It's more than likely
that they're responsible

35:12.460 --> 35:14.428
for one or both of these murders.

35:14.462 --> 35:17.164
Sir, I've taken a young lad
into custody, he spends a lot

35:17.199 --> 35:20.101
of time down at the docklands.
I think he might know something.

35:20.135 --> 35:23.270
Well, alright, I'll speak with him.

35:23.304 --> 35:25.805
Let me try, sir, I think
I can get him to talk.

35:25.840 --> 35:28.442
Fine. I'll speak with Mrs. Dawkins.

35:28.476 --> 35:30.944
- Sir.
- Alright.

35:30.978 --> 35:32.979
This is outrageous!

35:33.013 --> 35:34.981
Please, let me finish.

35:35.015 --> 35:37.317
First you suggest my husband
is consorting with doxies,

35:37.352 --> 35:39.319
and now you call him a murderer?

35:39.354 --> 35:43.322
Where was your husband
the night before his death?

35:43.357 --> 35:45.558
You mean the night before
he was brutally murdered?

35:45.592 --> 35:48.327
How you doing with that investigation?

35:50.330 --> 35:52.565
Please. Where was he?

35:52.599 --> 35:55.735
I don't know.

35:55.770 --> 35:59.037
Richard was no saint,
but he was not a killer.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.410
- I'm not a dog.
- Well, you certainly

36:04.444 --> 36:07.647
run like a dog. Would you
have preferred handcuffs?

36:07.681 --> 36:09.649
Where are you taking me?

36:09.683 --> 36:11.717
I'm taking you to the Don
Jail, and then they'll send you

36:11.752 --> 36:13.719
- off to the workhouse.
- You can't do that!

36:13.754 --> 36:16.321
- You broke the law!
- But...

36:16.355 --> 36:18.490
You can't. My mother needs me.

36:18.524 --> 36:20.659
Well, perhaps you should
have thought about that.

36:23.729 --> 36:26.164
If I tell you something,
will you let me go?

36:26.198 --> 36:29.033
I suppose it would depend
on what that something is.

36:31.804 --> 36:33.772
I can tell you who attacked the copper.

36:33.806 --> 36:36.573
I saw it.

36:36.608 --> 36:38.642
Tell me something.

36:43.215 --> 36:46.250
It was Mick and Tim O'Shea.

37:45.375 --> 37:47.709
What is this? It'll never happen!

37:47.744 --> 37:50.079
Just keep on walking, ladies.

37:50.113 --> 37:52.447
Let's see what our members of
parliament have to say to this.

37:52.482 --> 37:54.449
When he ripped that petition

37:54.484 --> 37:56.451
in front of us, I thought I would burst.

37:56.486 --> 38:00.355
Eileen! Eileen!

38:00.390 --> 38:04.092
You come home, right now!

38:04.126 --> 38:07.796
Did you not hear me?

38:12.368 --> 38:14.669
Just keep on walking, ladies.

38:20.910 --> 38:22.877
The boy will remain in
custody until the O'Sheas

38:22.912 --> 38:24.879
- are behind bars.
- Thank you, sir.

38:24.914 --> 38:26.948
- Jackson?
- Sir.

38:26.982 --> 38:29.150
You sure you up to this?

38:29.184 --> 38:31.119
- Right as rain.
- Alright.

39:06.454 --> 39:08.655
What do you want?

39:08.689 --> 39:11.624
We're looking for Mick and Tim O'Shea.

39:11.659 --> 39:13.760
They're not here.

39:13.794 --> 39:15.795
I'll be the judge of that.

39:15.830 --> 39:18.030
Let us pass.

39:18.065 --> 39:21.667
You'll pass when I say so.

39:21.701 --> 39:23.202
What we are asking for

39:23.236 --> 39:25.204
is not scandalous,

39:25.238 --> 39:27.206
although there are some who think

39:27.240 --> 39:29.976
our very presence here is shocking.

39:30.010 --> 39:32.144
Indeed, so shocking,

39:32.179 --> 39:34.213
that the government refuses to acknowledge

39:34.247 --> 39:37.516
our very existence.

39:37.550 --> 39:40.853
And we're not asking for
much. All we are asking

39:40.887 --> 39:43.288
is nothing more than to be treated

39:43.322 --> 39:45.724
as intelligent citizens.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.594
I'll arrest the lot of you if need be.

39:54.733 --> 39:56.734
- George.
- Lads!

40:00.072 --> 40:02.240
Stand aside.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.809
- Never!
- Men!

40:04.843 --> 40:07.645
And now we are asking more loudly

40:07.679 --> 40:11.248
and more forcibly, for you all know

40:11.282 --> 40:14.051
there is one inescapable truth:

40:14.085 --> 40:16.353
A woman has two children.

40:16.388 --> 40:20.558
One is quiet and mild,

40:20.592 --> 40:23.260
the other is loud

40:23.294 --> 40:25.796
and complaining.

40:25.831 --> 40:28.665
We know which one gets fed first.

40:28.699 --> 40:32.236
We know which one gets listened to.

40:32.270 --> 40:36.407
We have come here to... Get off of her!

41:07.571 --> 41:10.339
Emily, let's go! Quickly!

41:18.748 --> 41:21.083
You're not getting by!

41:26.790 --> 41:29.491
Take your hands off me!

41:53.716 --> 41:57.952
Mick O'Shea, you're under arrest!

41:57.987 --> 42:00.955
Show yourself!

42:07.496 --> 42:09.463
You should have listened.

42:09.498 --> 42:11.898
We own the waterfront.

42:16.308 --> 42:18.906
***

42:19.464 --> 42:22.066
You're not the law down here.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.168
O'Shea!

42:36.614 --> 42:38.816
Come on, Tim, let's get
away from here! Hurry up!

42:41.819 --> 42:43.786
Murdoch!

42:43.821 --> 42:47.457
Sir, get them!

42:47.491 --> 42:50.160
- Inspector!
- Crabtree.

42:50.194 --> 42:53.463
Go see to Murdoch.

42:53.497 --> 42:55.798
Where are you going?

42:55.833 --> 42:57.867
To end this.

43:00.203 --> 43:02.672
Sir!

43:02.706 --> 43:05.841
The O'Sheas are mine.
