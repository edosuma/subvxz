WEBVTT

00:02.420 --> 00:04.797
Jesus Christ, it's you again?

00:06.173 --> 00:08.050
I guess we've been gone
for a while, so...

00:08.134 --> 00:09.135
here's what happened.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.928
Oh, shit.
Wait.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.471
You guys invited Jabby?

00:12.555 --> 00:14.348
Last time I saw you,
you asked me to dinner.

00:14.432 --> 00:15.558
That offer still good?

00:15.641 --> 00:16.976
What, you want
to go on a date now?

00:17.059 --> 00:18.060
You know, I haven't
fucked that much

00:18.144 --> 00:19.103
since seventh grade
summer camp.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.354
You wanna do this again?

00:20.438 --> 00:21.355
Yeah.

00:22.565 --> 00:24.066
For our future baby.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.110
Hell no.
Over my dead damn body.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.404
You think I'm fucking
getting pregnant again?

00:28.487 --> 00:31.574
If you wanna talk about
adopting a newborn,

00:31.657 --> 00:32.825
we can discuss it.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.201
We're gonna have a baby?

00:34.285 --> 00:36.245
Not really.

00:36.328 --> 00:37.329
Major Keefe?

00:37.413 --> 00:39.373
He's my dad.
Is that a clip-on tie?

00:39.457 --> 00:41.208
Yeah. I don't know
how to tie a real one.

00:41.292 --> 00:42.293
No shit.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.878
There's a loophole
for West Point.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.254
It's there
in the fine print.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.630
- I want you to get in.
- Why?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.716
Because I want my boyfriend
to be West Point, Cadet.

00:48.799 --> 00:49.759
I'm your boyfriend?

00:49.842 --> 00:51.510
Yes.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.763
Since when do you
have a lady, Frank?

00:53.846 --> 00:57.183
She does run a bit hot
in terms of mental illness.

00:59.602 --> 01:01.187
Eat the Brie.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.271
Well, it's not about
what it looks like now.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.564
It's about what it's gonna be.

01:03.647 --> 01:05.149
Is this the thing
Whitford sucked you into?

01:05.232 --> 01:06.817
Don't forget my 25K.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.861
<i>Yeah, you don't
have enough revenue</i>

01:08.944 --> 01:10.571
to carry a third loan.

01:10.654 --> 01:11.864
Patty and I are separated.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.115
That didn't look separated
to me.

01:13.199 --> 01:14.617
We're getting a divorce.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.952
Why wouldn't you just tell me
that you're married?

01:17.036 --> 01:18.746
Take your fucking hands
off my car!

01:21.332 --> 01:22.333
You know,
let's figure this out.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.709
I mean, how deep are you
in the hole?

01:23.793 --> 01:25.211
I listed my building.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.378
<i>Gonna be an open house
at 1 p.m.</i>

01:26.462 --> 01:27.630
Wait, you wanna buy it?

01:27.713 --> 01:29.507
Could pay off your mortgages
and walk away.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.801
But that-that'll leave me
with nothing, Max.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.636

Here you go.

Oh, thanks.

Hey, Jabby, if you're gonna
be here every night,

06:29.098 --> 06:30.516
I'm gonna need you to start
pitching in for rent.

06:30.599 --> 06:31.683

06:38.065 --> 06:39.566
Byron is designing
an app.

06:39.650 --> 06:40.943
Byron's a feckless

06:41.026 --> 06:42.277
- Hey, watch it.
- You watch it.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.654
Okay, why don't
we all breathe?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.069
They're not even locked up.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.571
'Cause people don't own them.

09:30.654 --> 09:31.780
They share them.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.073
They share them?

09:33.156 --> 09:34.741
Yeah, they pay to use them,

09:34.825 --> 09:35.993
and then they leave them
wherever when they're done.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.203
That's stupid.
I could just steal 'em,

09:38.287 --> 09:40.455
sell 'em on the South Side,
make a good buck.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.667
It has a GPS tracker in it.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.419
I can get rid of that
in, like, two minutes.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.505
You know how many LoJacks
I've gotten rid of before?

09:55.095 --> 09:57.306
Okay. That's hot.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.109
What's going on?

10:09.651 --> 10:10.777
Getting ready
to knock it down.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.363
What? Why?

10:13.447 --> 10:14.990
Making room for condos.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.408
Gonna take up
the whole block.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.994
No shit.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.165
I used to own this building.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.001
Yeah? I used to own
Sears Tower.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.841
Hey. Nice, thanks
for getting breakfast.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.343
If I was at softball camp
right now,

10:34.426 --> 10:35.469
I'd be running laps.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.470
Suckers.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.096
What are you guys up to today?

10:38.180 --> 10:39.348
Oh, you know,
same old, same old:

10:39.431 --> 10:42.351
junk food, binge,
junk food, nap.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.894
Uh, run through the sprinkler.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.062
Work on my essay.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.396
Still watching <i>Dexter?</i>

10:46.480 --> 10:47.522
Nah, finished it.

10:47.606 --> 10:48.940
Now we're on <i>Friends.</i>

10:49.024 --> 10:50.108
Nice, what's next?

10:50.192 --> 10:51.902
On to G. <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>

10:51.985 --> 10:53.028
I'm living the dream.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.238
Hey, knock-knock.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.615
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.699
Morning.

10:59.242 --> 11:02.329
Hello, beautiful.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.292
Okay, let's go.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.627
Where are you going?

11:08.710 --> 11:10.504
Uh, don't know.
Ingrid?

11:10.587 --> 11:12.172
It's a surprise.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.675
I love surprises!

11:14.758 --> 11:16.134
Liam was one.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.137
Where's my Egg McMuffin?

11:19.221 --> 11:20.305
Frank.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.224
Ugh.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.475
What the hell?

11:26.687 --> 11:27.979
Fuck.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.787
Morning, Dottie.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.372
You have power?

11:54.673 --> 11:56.425
Morning, Ms. Sink.

11:56.508 --> 11:57.801
You have power too?

11:57.884 --> 11:59.010
Who's asking?

11:59.094 --> 12:01.179
It's Debbie.
From down the street.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.556
Mind your business.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.268
We're the only ones
without power.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.477
We forget
to pay the bills?

12:07.561 --> 12:09.146
I don't know.
Fiona pays them.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.480
I'll call her.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.788
$475,000.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.207
Max, you motherfucker.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.085
You sold my building.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.809
Hey. We are out
of a ton of stuff.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.269
Eggs, straws, ground beef,
hash browns,

12:49.352 --> 12:50.687
tomatoes, blah, blah, blah.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.105
But I ordered it,
'cause I take initiative.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.440
It'll be here today.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.650
Also, the ice machine's broken.
But don't worry.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.319
I handled it.
The guy's on his way.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.653
I'm good at my job.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.906
And I say this 'cause
I love my fellow employees,

13:00.989 --> 13:02.365
hopefully you're getting
our paychecks out tomorrow?

13:02.449 --> 13:04.034
Yep. Thanks.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.368
You okay?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.454
Yeah. I'm tired.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.335
Okay.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.003
We're here.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.755
Are you ready?

13:16.838 --> 13:17.964
Yep. Ready. Ready.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.382
Okay.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.176
Surprise!

13:22.469 --> 13:23.845
Where?

13:24.596 --> 13:26.807
I froze my eggs.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.266
They're in here.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.893
You want to see 'em
up close?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.228
Oh, yes.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.271
Let me see my babies.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.029
Hi.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.574
All my life,

13:44.658 --> 13:46.660
all I ever wanted
was to be a mother.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.037
But Randy was always
so against it.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.664
Wouldn't even talk about it.

13:51.706 --> 13:52.999
But now I have you.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.711
You've given me
a second chance.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.046
- I have?
- Mm.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.048
Frank...

14:00.131 --> 14:02.300
would you fertilize my eggs?

14:02.884 --> 14:05.011
Are you kidding me?

14:05.554 --> 14:08.473
I would be honored to introduce
my little Frankies

14:08.557 --> 14:10.141
to your little Ingrids.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.518
Oh, Frank.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.104
Thank you so much.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.857
<i>But we never got
a bill.</i>

14:16.940 --> 14:19.359
No, I'm not still
at 4503 Wolfcrest.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.486
That's my sister's old address.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.240
Oh, well, is that where
you sent the bill?

14:26.992 --> 14:29.494
Okay, well, that makes sense.

14:29.578 --> 14:30.829
Thank you.

14:32.581 --> 14:33.874
<i>Are you sure
this is the right place?</i>

14:33.957 --> 14:35.625
This is the address
she gave me.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.377
Casa De Oro.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.796
Yep. This is the place.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.555
Can I help you?

14:48.638 --> 14:50.265
Yeah, uh, we're here
to see May?

14:50.348 --> 14:51.349
Great, have a seat

14:51.433 --> 14:52.434
and I'll let her know
you're here.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.643
Thank you.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.521
Excuse me.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.994
These remind me
of my group home.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.788
Aw, they gave you candy?

15:13.872 --> 15:15.790
It was our supper.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.522
They look like runners.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.399
I bet they're on the track team
or something.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.612
Do we get to name him
after he's ours?

15:45.695 --> 15:47.864
I don't know.

15:47.948 --> 15:50.533
Little Kev.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.577
- Kevin Jr.
- Hmm!

15:52.661 --> 15:55.246
KJ.
Ooh, that's good.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.957
KJ Ball.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.335
KJ Ball?
Are you kidding me?

16:00.418 --> 16:03.588
Sounds like a sports name
if I ever heard one.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.256
God, I hope
he plays baseball.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.508
What if he plays soccer?

16:06.591 --> 16:09.427
V, do not ruin this for me
right now, okay?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.390
No one's playing soccer.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.601

16:50.802 --> 16:52.762
Sweet Jesus.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.765
Hi. Pardon me.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.977
Ugh!

17:01.146 --> 17:02.439
Hey, not the sound
you wanna hear

17:02.522 --> 17:03.606
when you're eating
in a restaurant.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.691
What's up?

17:04.774 --> 17:06.985
Have you seen the gum
under all the tables?

17:07.068 --> 17:09.362
- No.
- It's disgusting.

17:09.446 --> 17:10.905
You know,
what do you guys do?

17:10.989 --> 17:12.866
Make sure to chew gum
on your way over?

17:12.949 --> 17:14.284
Like, "Going to Patsy's.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.577
Better chew some gum

17:15.660 --> 17:18.079
so I can shove it up
under the tables?"

17:18.163 --> 17:19.831
Sorry.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.333
God.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.837
- Ugh.
- She okay?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.672
I'm not sure.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.049
She's acting kinda crazy.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.759
Little bit.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.848
What'd they say?

17:36.931 --> 17:38.767
Two and a half months
past due.

17:38.850 --> 17:39.893
That's not that bad.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.436
Not that bad?

17:41.519 --> 17:43.021
Do you not pay your bills
or something?

17:43.104 --> 17:44.105
We don't use electricity.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.190
It's against the Koran.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.525
- Really?
- No, it's a joke.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.152
You think Muslims don't
believe in electricity?

17:49.819 --> 17:51.905
So they gonna turn
the power back on or what?

17:51.988 --> 17:54.157
Yeah, once I pay them $800

17:54.240 --> 17:55.825
plus a reactivation fee

17:55.909 --> 17:57.702
plus a past due charge.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.621
Fuckers. That's extortion.

17:59.704 --> 18:00.872
Yeah, no shit.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.083
Would you like me to send
a suicide bomber?

18:03.166 --> 18:04.751
Sweet of you to offer,

18:04.834 --> 18:06.711
but no, thanks.
I think I'll just pay it.

18:06.795 --> 18:07.921
Suit yourself.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.631
None of the other bills
have been paid either:

18:09.714 --> 18:11.966
gas, cable, water.

18:12.050 --> 18:15.095
Whoops.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.561
- Hey.
- What's up, Tami?

18:23.645 --> 18:25.230
Boys.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.982
I found a cool apartment
I want to show you.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.109
Wanna check it out?

18:29.192 --> 18:31.069
Uh...yeah, no, I would.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.279
I'm just, uh...you know,

18:33.363 --> 18:34.781
working.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.033
Well, you get a lunch break,
don't you?

18:37.117 --> 18:40.120
Uh, no, not really.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.579
What the hell, Brad?

18:41.663 --> 18:44.040
You don't give your employees
a lunch break?

18:44.124 --> 18:45.416
We got work to do.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.168
We kinda just eat
whenever we can.

18:47.252 --> 18:48.753
What a dick.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.005
Hey, Gordon Ramsay,
this isn't <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

18:51.089 --> 18:53.424
You know, people
get lunch breaks.

18:53.508 --> 18:54.759
You should unionize.

18:54.843 --> 18:56.136
Really?

18:56.219 --> 18:57.929
Come on. Let's eat.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.056
He'll be back in an hour.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.391
It's your sister-in-law.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.269
Yeah, and he's a Brad.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.274
Now all we gotta do is wait.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.442
I can't believe nobody's
ever thought of this.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.862
Yeah, you know, if these people
can afford to pay for yoga,

19:13.945 --> 19:16.531
they can afford to pay me
to rent a scooter.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.743
Uh...

19:20.827 --> 19:22.662
excuse me, um...

19:22.745 --> 19:24.455
I think you have my scooter
in the back of your truck.

19:24.539 --> 19:25.874
Your scooter?

19:25.957 --> 19:27.208
Nah, these are public scooters.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.293
We gotta share 'em.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.377
Yeah, you're not sharing them.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.461
You're hogging them.

19:30.545 --> 19:31.880
Well, I'm happy
to rent you one.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.381
- Ten bucks.
- What?

19:33.464 --> 19:34.924
No, I--that...

19:35.008 --> 19:36.009
that's extortion.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.678
Technically it's racketeering,
but sure.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.597
Okay. I'll call
Better Business Bureau.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.640
Okay. Whatever the fuck
that is.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.726
Come on. We need these
to go get a boba.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.102
And I, for one,
am not walking.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.187
Yeah, we're going
to get boba.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.355
Well, maybe if you took a walk
every once in a while,

19:49.439 --> 19:51.941
you wouldn't have to spend
25 bucks on yoga.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.360
I need a scooter, dude.
I just did an hour of hot yoga.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.653
I don't know what
to tell you, dude.

19:55.737 --> 19:56.738
They're already on the truck.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.114
Them's the rules.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.365
Fine.

20:01.743 --> 20:02.785
Ten bucks.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.287
- It's 15 now.
- What?

20:04.370 --> 20:05.914
Yeah, 'cause you're ungrateful.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.832
You know what?
This is such bullshit.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.585
This neighborhood's
going to shit.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.545
Fuck this.
I'm out.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.007
- Thank you for your business.
- Mm.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.057
We good?

20:24.849 --> 20:26.351
So far.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.355
We're very excited.

20:32.523 --> 20:33.816
Need both of your initials

20:33.900 --> 20:35.818
everywhere there's a blank.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.528
Be right back.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.370
Oh, this is good.

21:05.515 --> 21:06.849
This is Santiago.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.894
Santiago...

21:15.817 --> 21:17.110
Doesn't speak a word
of English.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.528
- No problem.
- Great.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.612
<i>No problemo.</i>

21:20.071 --> 21:21.990
He knows the national
anthem, though.

21:23.449 --> 21:28.371
<i>♪♪ Oh, say, can you see ♪♪</i>

21:28.454 --> 21:31.708
<i>♪♪ By the dawn's
early light ♪♪</i>

21:31.791 --> 21:33.668
That's beautiful.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.670
<i>- ♪♪ What so proudly ♪♪</i>
- This is gonna be so great.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.548
<i>- ♪♪ We hailed ♪♪</i>
- So great.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.757
Living area.

21:39.841 --> 21:42.593
Master bedroom.
Stainless steel appliances.

21:42.677 --> 21:45.096
This place is huge.
I don't need this much space.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.472
Hey, just look at it.

21:46.556 --> 21:48.308
See the outside?
Your own private patio?

21:48.391 --> 21:50.685
- Yeah.
- So you can smoke.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.855
Look, if I get an apartment,
it's gonna be a studio.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.023
Fine.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.566
But I'm not fucking
on some daybed

21:56.649 --> 21:57.650
next to a kitchenette.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.027
Why not?

21:59.110 --> 22:01.237
We also offer a large amount
of community amenities:

22:01.321 --> 22:02.989
state-of-the-art gym,
sauna,

22:03.072 --> 22:04.907
quartz crystal fire pit.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.326
What, like a grill?

22:06.409 --> 22:08.745
No, no, like, on our
rooftop social area.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.455
We got a 50-inch
outdoor fire pit.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.415
Good for hanging out with
your friends during the winter.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.958
Drink some rosé. Chill.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.084
Why would I want
to freeze outside

22:15.168 --> 22:16.252
when I could be inside?

22:16.336 --> 22:18.004
There's heat lamps, buddy.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.256
Okay.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.597
Yo, yo, yo.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.057
All right.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.433
I'm gonna tell you something.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.852
But when I tell you,
don't look, all right?

22:32.935 --> 22:34.145
Okay.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.438
This guy has maybe

22:35.521 --> 22:38.107
the biggest dick
I've ever seen.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.275
How do you know?

22:39.359 --> 22:40.777
It's bulging through his pants.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.195
It's like a fucking
balloon animal.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.864
Don't look, though.
Don't look.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.366
Whoa.

22:47.075 --> 22:50.161
- You like?
- Dude.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.038
No way that's real.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.457
It's real.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.541
Bullshit.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.001
You seriously walk around

22:57.085 --> 22:59.879
with a giant rubber dildo
in your pants?

22:59.962 --> 23:02.715
Come on. We gotta go.
I can't live here, all right?

23:02.799 --> 23:04.509
- If you don't believe me...
- Hey, no, we believe you, man.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.552
- We believe you, okay?
- That's not real.

23:06.636 --> 23:07.845
- It's not.
- Either way,

23:07.929 --> 23:09.389
I don't want that guy
fixing my sink.

23:15.395 --> 23:16.646
Hey, champ.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.106
Need a scooter?

23:18.189 --> 23:19.190
Go to hell.

23:19.273 --> 23:20.566
We got one left.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.235
Yeah, man.
You look exhausted.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.403
You know,
you guys are assholes.

23:23.486 --> 23:24.654
Assholes with scooters.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.863
You want one?

23:25.947 --> 23:27.490
Do you really have
nothing better to do?

23:27.573 --> 23:28.574
Hey, you're the one
that's walking around

23:28.658 --> 23:29.909
in the middle of the day.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.495
Yeah, at least
we're racketeering.

23:33.871 --> 23:36.124
We're still here.

23:39.794 --> 23:41.212
That was totally worth it.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.630
We should run over
that fucker.

23:44.424 --> 23:45.883
Mr. Gallagher?

23:47.510 --> 23:49.262
There's a collection room
around the corner,

23:49.345 --> 23:51.681
and this is for your
semen collection.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.266
My semen collection.

23:53.349 --> 23:55.143
A new line of menswear.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.478
Peacoats.
Captain's hats.

23:57.562 --> 23:59.939
Just get your stuff
inside the cup.

24:00.022 --> 24:01.732
And make sure you wash
and rinse your hands

24:01.816 --> 24:02.984
thoroughly beforehand.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.402
Things to look at?

24:04.485 --> 24:05.778
There will be some material
in the restroom

24:05.862 --> 24:06.988
if you need it.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.656
Thank you.

24:10.575 --> 24:11.826
I'm going to the bank.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.161
What about gum patrol?

24:13.244 --> 24:16.247
Keep an eye.
See you later.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.292
- My favorite customer.
- What's up, Ilya?

24:19.375 --> 24:20.668
What is up?
You know.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.211
Living American dream.

24:22.295 --> 24:23.129
- Huh.
- My own store.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.589
What can I say?

24:24.672 --> 24:27.049
Yeah. Can I get a
half pint of Stoli,

24:27.133 --> 24:29.385
Marlboro Silvers, and a...

24:29.469 --> 24:31.179
scratcher, please?
The crossword one.

24:31.762 --> 24:33.055
Russian lunch.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.265
Yeah.

24:34.348 --> 24:35.600
No. That's joke.

24:35.683 --> 24:36.767
Not really Russian lunch.

24:36.851 --> 24:37.894
We like many foods.

24:38.686 --> 24:39.979
Do you need matches?

24:40.062 --> 24:42.482
No.
Nobody ever needs matches.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.567
If you say so.
That's twenty-eight.

24:44.650 --> 24:45.651
Here's your change.

24:45.735 --> 24:46.944
See you tomorrow.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.571
You bet.

24:58.039 --> 24:59.624
That was quick.

24:59.707 --> 25:00.958
Here's the thing.

25:01.042 --> 25:03.211
That material,
as you call it, is subpar.

25:03.294 --> 25:04.712
It's from the '70s.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.256
It's on videotape,
for Christ's sake.

25:07.340 --> 25:08.674
The women have pubic hair.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.843
I feel like I'm watching
my parents have sex.

25:10.927 --> 25:12.970
It actually made me sad.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.598
So needless to say,
my cup is empty,

25:15.681 --> 25:16.974
as is my desire.

25:17.058 --> 25:19.685
Do you have anything else?
Something...

25:19.769 --> 25:21.062
from the early '90s?

25:21.145 --> 25:22.355
Some Nina Hartley?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.065
Racquel Darrian, perhaps?

25:24.148 --> 25:26.817
- Sorry.
- What about crazy?

25:26.901 --> 25:30.112
You got any videos
of crazy people having sex?

25:30.196 --> 25:31.989
No, sir.
That's all we have.

25:32.073 --> 25:34.909
Okay. Work with me here.
What about my girlfriend?

25:34.992 --> 25:37.161
Could I bring Ingrid in
to help me

25:37.245 --> 25:39.288
bust a-a collection?

25:39.372 --> 25:41.666
That would be fine,
but you both need to

25:41.749 --> 25:45.086
thoroughly, thoroughly
wash and rinse your hands.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.088
And saliva and/or lubricant
are prohibited,

25:47.171 --> 25:49.549
as they will pollute
the sample.

25:49.632 --> 25:50.883
Fine.

25:50.967 --> 25:52.426
Thank you, Dawn.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.762
I'm off to Spunkytown.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.684
Why are we looking
at apartments?

25:59.767 --> 26:01.894
Uh, 'cause you still live
with your brothers and sisters

26:01.978 --> 26:02.979
in a sad house?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.313
So?

26:04.397 --> 26:06.065
You live with two bitches
and Byron.

26:06.148 --> 26:07.024
Is that better?

26:07.108 --> 26:08.150
No, it's not.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.819
That's why you need a place.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.487
What, you want
to move in together?

26:11.571 --> 26:14.031
No, in your dreams.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.658
No, all I'm saying is,
one of us

26:15.741 --> 26:17.660
needs to have an apartment
so that we have a fuck pad.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.912
So man up.
Get your own place.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.664
Why don't you get
your own place?

26:21.747 --> 26:23.291
I can't.
My name's on the lease.

26:23.374 --> 26:24.458
Those bitches sublet.

26:24.542 --> 26:25.668
All right, well,
I can't either.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.877
You know,
I don't have your life:

26:26.961 --> 26:28.546
single-origin coffee,
spin class,

26:28.629 --> 26:29.880
Murphy's Bleachers--

26:29.964 --> 26:31.716
- I live in West Town.
- So what?

26:31.799 --> 26:33.593
So you hate staying
at my apartment.

26:33.676 --> 26:34.885
I hate sleeping
at your place.

26:34.969 --> 26:36.178
We gotta figure
something out.

26:37.763 --> 26:38.973
All right, you know,
I've been thinking about

26:39.056 --> 26:40.558
turning our basement
into a bedroom.

26:40.641 --> 26:41.851
Okay, is it nice?

26:41.934 --> 26:44.186
No, but it could work.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.271
All right.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.564
We just--we gotta
figure something out

26:46.647 --> 26:48.858
before I murder Byron.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.067
Guy's a vegetarian.

26:50.151 --> 26:53.321
- He wears pajamas.
- That guy's an asshole.

26:53.404 --> 26:54.530
Also, we used to date.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.574
What? How?

26:56.657 --> 26:58.284
I was experimenting, okay?

26:58.367 --> 27:01.203
Instead of a lesbian,
I chose Byron.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.663
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ugh, I know.

27:02.747 --> 27:04.707
Blegh.

27:04.790 --> 27:05.916
Look.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.210
I'm not getting an apartment
right now, but, uh,

27:08.294 --> 27:09.837
let's stay at my house tonight

27:09.920 --> 27:11.672
and we'll see if
the basement'll work.

27:11.756 --> 27:12.757
Fine.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.009
Okay, but if I'm
staying in that dump,

27:15.092 --> 27:16.719
we gotta make some changes.

27:16.802 --> 27:17.803
All right.

27:17.887 --> 27:18.929
What are you getting here?

27:19.013 --> 27:20.723
Uh, Chicago dog.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.308
Cool. Get me one too.

27:23.434 --> 27:24.852
Hey, everyone.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.897
I'd like you to meet
our son, Santiago.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.358
Santiago...

27:30.441 --> 27:31.567
these people.

27:31.651 --> 27:32.860
- Cheers.
- Welcome.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.945
- Hi.
- Does he speak English?

27:35.029 --> 27:36.947
Uh, no.
But he sings it.

27:37.031 --> 27:39.075
He knows how to sing
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

27:39.158 --> 27:40.534

28:45.141 --> 28:46.684
From your job sites and shit?

28:46.767 --> 28:48.102
Yeah, a little bit.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.187
Can you talk to Santiago
for us?

28:50.271 --> 28:51.939
- Sure.
- Thanks, man.

28:52.022 --> 28:54.024
Santiago.

28:56.152 --> 28:58.112
<i>Andale. Trabajo.</i>

28:58.195 --> 29:00.156
<i>Vámonos.</i>

29:02.283 --> 29:03.367
Really?

29:03.451 --> 29:05.035
Sorry, that's all I know.

29:06.162 --> 29:08.247
<i>You little spaceman.</i>

29:08.330 --> 29:09.790

29:11.417 --> 29:12.835

29:12.918 --> 29:14.545
<i>Okay, yeah, yeah.</i>

29:14.628 --> 29:16.338

- Yeah, there we go.</i>

29:16.422 --> 29:18.048
<i>- There, we see it now.
- That worked.</i>

29:18.132 --> 29:19.383
<i>- Yeah. Oh, Houston.
- Okay. Okay.</i>

29:19.467 --> 29:21.051
<i>Houston,
we have liftoff.</i>

29:21.135 --> 29:22.928
<i>That's right.
There we go now.</i>

29:23.012 --> 29:24.930
<i>- Look at that.
- You're gonna go.</i>

29:25.014 --> 29:26.348
<i>- Get the bottle!
- I got it! I got it!</i>

29:26.432 --> 29:27.767
<i>- I got it.
- Okay.</i>

29:27.850 --> 29:29.560
<i>Blastoff!</i>

29:29.643 --> 29:31.395
<i>Mm.</i>

29:31.479 --> 29:34.774
I recently lost my father
to a skydiving accident.

29:34.857 --> 29:37.276
The propeller.
I can't talk about it.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.652
He was all I had.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.112
If you take away my cable,

29:40.196 --> 29:41.739
oh, I might have
to hang myself.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.324
You're evil.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.331
Hey, Carpool.

29:56.045 --> 29:59.089
Fucking Max Whitford.

30:01.091 --> 30:03.302
It's a hell of a view.

30:03.385 --> 30:04.678
Yeah.

30:09.517 --> 30:11.018
You know what I love

30:11.101 --> 30:12.770
about afternoon?

30:14.355 --> 30:17.274
Evening
is just around the corner.

30:17.358 --> 30:18.818
Happy hour.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.321
Everybody's in a good mood.

30:22.404 --> 30:25.783
And then right after that,
nighttime.

30:25.866 --> 30:28.452
You get to celebrate
the end of another day.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.418
So how'd you wind up here?

30:38.087 --> 30:40.256
- You mean homeless?
- Mm-hmm.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.426
I was a music producer.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.932
- No shit, really?
- Yeah.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.351
Big-time. Jazz.

30:53.477 --> 30:54.478
What happened?

30:55.646 --> 30:58.274
MP3s killed the industry.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.154
Hey.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.011
Hey, I won two bucks.

31:27.094 --> 31:28.387
No shit.

31:28.679 --> 31:29.680
Awesome.

Hi.

31:40.858 --> 31:42.943
Unfortunately I can only
pay half right now.

31:43.027 --> 31:44.904
But please don't turn off
my gas.

31:44.987 --> 31:46.530
It's the only way
I can heat up the MREs

31:46.614 --> 31:48.282
my husband sends me from Yemen

31:48.365 --> 31:49.700
for our daughter.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.995
Actually, I was hoping
you could give me a break

31:53.078 --> 31:54.330
on the late fees.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.333
You see, I was
recently diagnosed with...

31:57.416 --> 31:58.959
I don't want to bore you
with the details.

31:59.043 --> 32:01.045
But I only have a few months
left to live.

32:01.128 --> 32:02.463
As a proud organ donor,

32:02.546 --> 32:05.633
all of these will be
up for grabs pretty soon.

32:05.716 --> 32:08.135
Except for the colon.

32:08.218 --> 32:09.678
Not the colon.

<i>♪♪ I did a bad, bad thing ♪♪</i>

32:12.264 --> 32:13.599
All right, we have
the results back

32:13.682 --> 32:15.100
from your sperm analysis.

32:15.184 --> 32:17.811
Fantastic. Wait, I want
Ingrid to-to hear this.

32:17.895 --> 32:18.979
Uh, uh, I-I wouldn't.

32:19.063 --> 32:20.689
I-I'm afraid
your motility score,

32:20.773 --> 32:23.317
which is the percentage
of sperm that are moving,

32:23.400 --> 32:24.401
is very low.

32:24.485 --> 32:25.527
In fact,

32:25.611 --> 32:28.614
you had only one motile sperm.

32:28.697 --> 32:32.201
What? How is that possible?

32:32.284 --> 32:34.370
- One.
- Bet it's a fighter, though.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.455
- Right?
- He's barely moving.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.290
You also have
a very low concentration

32:38.374 --> 32:39.833
of sperm
in your semen.

32:39.917 --> 32:42.336
Are-are you sure you tested
the right sperm?

32:42.419 --> 32:44.588
I'm as fertile as a bumblebee.

32:44.672 --> 32:47.257
I got six ungrateful kids
to prove it.

32:47.341 --> 32:48.342
Well, take a look.

32:50.594 --> 32:52.179
Is this slow motion?

32:52.262 --> 32:55.432
I wish.
The rest are dead.

32:55.516 --> 32:56.809
Look at him.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.018
Jesus.

32:58.102 --> 33:00.729
Poor little bastard
has no idea.

33:02.523 --> 33:04.066
Are you currently
taking any medications?

33:04.149 --> 33:05.526
Well...

33:05.609 --> 33:08.570
y-yeah, there's
the anti-rejection medication

33:08.654 --> 33:10.781
I take for my
liver transplant.

33:10.864 --> 33:13.659
The occasional
random pharmaceutical.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.037
That could be affecting your
motility and concentration.

33:17.121 --> 33:18.580
Uh, sometimes prescriptions

33:18.664 --> 33:20.958
can negatively affect
the sperm count.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.252
I'm sorry,
but we won't be able

33:23.335 --> 33:24.795
to successfully fertilize

33:24.878 --> 33:27.047
Ingrid's eggs with your sperm.

33:29.550 --> 33:30.843
Can I have another chance?

33:30.926 --> 33:32.553
I-I really think
they were lethargic

33:32.636 --> 33:34.471
because of the sterile
environment.

33:34.555 --> 33:36.098
If I could do it at home

33:36.181 --> 33:38.225
with some decent visual aids,

33:38.308 --> 33:40.602
I think you'd really see
what my boys can do.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.609
Take the cup.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.611
But we need the specimen
back within two hours

33:49.695 --> 33:51.030
of it exiting the body.

33:51.113 --> 33:52.322
And it needs to be kept warm,

33:52.406 --> 33:53.741
so keep it close to the body.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.951
And please don't use
any condoms or lubricant,

33:56.035 --> 33:58.203
as those negatively affect
the sample.

33:58.287 --> 33:59.788
No condoms.
No lube.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.582
Two hours.
Got it.

34:04.001 --> 34:05.002
What'd she say?

34:05.085 --> 34:06.336
Tell me.

34:06.420 --> 34:07.838
- It's all good news.
- Really?

34:07.921 --> 34:08.922
That's great.

34:09.006 --> 34:10.132
But they-they're not
gonna fertilize

34:10.215 --> 34:11.550
the eggs just yet.

34:11.633 --> 34:12.634
Why not?

34:12.718 --> 34:14.470
They-they just want
to observe the sperm

34:14.553 --> 34:15.846
for a couple hours, you know,

34:15.929 --> 34:17.598
so they can select
the strongest swimmers.

34:17.681 --> 34:20.768
So I was gonna pop out
and run a few quick errands.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.144
Perfect.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.104
I'm so happy.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.731
Hey, I left my debit card
at home.

34:25.814 --> 34:27.524
Could you spot me
some walking-around money?

34:27.608 --> 34:28.609
I'll pay you back.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.778
Oh, sure.

34:30.861 --> 34:32.154
Of course.
Here you go.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.906
- You're perfect.
- Mm.

34:35.491 --> 34:36.492
Thanks for driving.

34:36.575 --> 34:37.659
No problem.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.536
There she is.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.246
Hi.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.207
Hi, pretty girl.

34:43.290 --> 34:46.126
Did you miss me?

34:46.877 --> 34:48.796
Do you remember Farhad?

34:48.879 --> 34:50.005
Say, "Hi, Farhad."

34:50.089 --> 34:52.257
- Beer?
- Yes.

34:56.887 --> 34:57.971
Thanks.

34:58.055 --> 34:59.389
Jesus, why is it so cold?

34:59.473 --> 35:01.016
Beer doesn't need
to be cold.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.684
It's delicious enough
as it is.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.603
Five? What the fuck?

35:04.686 --> 35:06.105
Carl!

35:06.188 --> 35:07.523
What? What?

35:07.606 --> 35:09.983
Could you come
to the kitchen, please?

35:11.652 --> 35:13.612
Sorry, didn't mean
to interrupt nap time.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.739
No. It woke us up
when the power came back on.

35:15.823 --> 35:16.990
Scared the shit out of us.

35:17.074 --> 35:18.200
Yeah, you're welcome.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.785
I took care of the bills,
by the way.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.120
Cost 1,700 bucks.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.579
- Damn.
- Yeah.

35:22.663 --> 35:24.123
You can pay me back.

35:24.206 --> 35:25.791
I've been giving Fiona
money for the bills.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.085
So has Lip. She just
hasn't been paying them.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.711
Just because Lip and I
both have jobs

35:29.795 --> 35:31.713
doesn't mean we're gonna be
paying for everything now.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.132
Especially now that Ian
is in prison

35:33.215 --> 35:35.008
and Frank is Frank.

35:35.092 --> 35:37.094
So...

35:37.177 --> 35:39.012
the squirrel fund is back.

35:39.096 --> 35:40.514
Everyone needs to step up.

35:40.597 --> 35:41.890
Damn.

35:41.974 --> 35:43.851
Debbie has the con.

35:47.396 --> 35:48.730
He is a hard worker.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.232
Yeah, thanks a lot, Tommy.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.817
Now I can't get him to stop.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.152
Hey, can I borrow him?

35:53.235 --> 35:55.028
My mom's yard looks like shit.

35:55.112 --> 35:56.989
Did-did he come
with a leaf blower?

35:59.074 --> 36:00.617
Santiago.

36:01.285 --> 36:02.286
Baseball?

36:10.711 --> 36:13.338
Good catch, buddy.
Toss it back to me now.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.224
Kid brought the heat.

36:24.308 --> 36:25.767
Oh, my God,
he's got a cannon.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.853
This is gonna be
the best summer ever.

36:27.936 --> 36:29.897
I am so proud of you.

36:31.732 --> 36:33.984
You remember Mrs. Hernandez
from the dry cleaners'?

36:34.067 --> 36:35.277
Of course. How you doing,
Mrs. Hernandez?

36:35.360 --> 36:36.403
I'm fine, thank you.

36:36.486 --> 36:37.654
Mrs. Hernandez,

36:37.738 --> 36:40.199
this is Santiago, the boy
I was telling you about.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.451
Mrs. Hernandez,
we were wondering, though,

36:42.534 --> 36:44.328
if you could ask some questions
of Santiago for us.

36:44.411 --> 36:45.787
His favorite snacks.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.706
- His favorite movies.
- Favorite toys.

36:47.789 --> 36:49.666
Okay.

36:49.750 --> 36:50.751
<i>Hola.</i>

37:25.744 --> 37:28.372
Ask him if he knows
how to throw a changeup.

37:28.455 --> 37:31.500
He crossed the border
with his father and sister.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.920
They were looking for asylum,
but they got separated.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.755
And now he doesn't know
where they are.

37:36.838 --> 37:38.465
Hmm.

37:38.548 --> 37:40.550
Wait, he has family here?

37:40.634 --> 37:42.761
They come here 'cause
they're afraid to be killed.

37:43.929 --> 37:44.930
Well, he's ours now.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.307
We signed the paperwork.

37:47.391 --> 37:48.892
And I love him.

37:49.518 --> 37:51.353
We can't keep this kid.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.063
Yes, we can.
He has an amazing arm.

37:53.146 --> 37:54.982
He has a family.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.490
Mmm.
Damn.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.951
These are tasty.

38:06.034 --> 38:09.371
All we ever had at my house
was trail mix and oranges.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.622
Can I have another beer?

38:10.706 --> 38:12.249
Yeah, sure.

38:17.254 --> 38:18.588
Damn. Why are these warm?

38:18.672 --> 38:21.508
One? It's supposed
to be at five.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.180
What the fuck?

38:27.264 --> 38:29.182
You know, I got the GPS
out of this thing,

38:29.266 --> 38:31.143
but it still won't work.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.478
Hmm. Wait, hold on a second.

38:33.562 --> 38:35.063
- What's up?
- Their website says

38:35.147 --> 38:36.606
that if you recharge
the scooters,

38:36.690 --> 38:38.358
- they'll pay you.
- How much?

38:38.442 --> 38:40.402
Uh, between five and 20
a scooter?

38:40.485 --> 38:41.486
- Per scooter?
- What?

38:41.570 --> 38:43.113
- Holy shit.
- All you gotta do is sign up.

38:43.196 --> 38:45.407
And find a bunch
of them bitches, though.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.491
I can help you.

38:48.118 --> 38:49.494
How you two doing?

38:50.662 --> 38:51.663
Fine.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.290
Yeah?

38:53.373 --> 38:54.833
How 'bout you?
How you doing?

38:54.916 --> 38:55.917
Great.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.252
Uh-huh.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.754
Okay.

39:00.213 --> 39:02.424
Hey, could I talk
to you upstairs?

39:04.217 --> 39:05.218
I'll be right back.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.057
All right, what do
you want, Frank?

39:10.140 --> 39:11.391
Kelly seems nice.

39:11.475 --> 39:12.768
A little sad.

39:12.851 --> 39:13.894
Yeah, well,
she's not sad.

39:13.977 --> 39:14.978
No, no, no, no, no, no.

39:15.062 --> 39:16.897
I recognize that vacant stare.

39:16.980 --> 39:19.066
I've known a lot
of women, Carl.

39:19.149 --> 39:21.026
And that woman is not getting
what she wants in bed.

39:21.109 --> 39:22.110
Shut up, Frank.

39:22.194 --> 39:24.196
You know what it is.
She wants sex.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.198
Ten times a day.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.491
Not fucking snack time.

39:27.574 --> 39:28.784
Act like a Gallagher,
for the love of God.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.619
Okay, I can have sex
anytime, anywhere.

39:30.702 --> 39:31.703
Oh, bullshit.

39:31.787 --> 39:33.580
I got 20 bucks that says

39:33.663 --> 39:34.664
you can't go
in that bathroom--

39:34.748 --> 39:36.208
That's a hundred.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.752
Holy crap.

39:39.836 --> 39:41.963
Well, 20 of it says

39:42.047 --> 39:43.757
you can't go in that bathroom
right now

39:43.840 --> 39:45.967
and rub one out
in under three minutes.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.094
I'm trying to help you.

39:47.177 --> 39:49.763
If that woman downstairs
yells, "Jump,"

39:49.846 --> 39:52.140
??
you better answer, How hard?

39:52.641 --> 39:54.059
Make it a hundred.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.061
No. The bet's 20.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.813
No, wait. Fine. Fine.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.439
Fine. Okay. Fine.

39:59.523 --> 40:02.484
It's all right.
Jesus Christ.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.069
A hundred.

40:04.152 --> 40:05.695
What the fuck is that?

40:05.779 --> 40:06.905
I gotta have proof.

40:06.988 --> 40:09.616
You want me to come in there
with you and watch?

40:14.579 --> 40:15.789
Under three minutes.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.417
- No lube, no saliva.
- No problem.

40:21.253 --> 40:22.629
Hey, Carl.
Remember the time

40:22.712 --> 40:24.965
we walked in on Aunt Ginger
and saw her tits?

40:25.048 --> 40:26.800
<i>Hey, Frank.
Shut the fuck up.</i>

40:26.883 --> 40:29.094
Were they something?

40:29.177 --> 40:32.472
Been watching this thing
on the, uh, nature channel

40:32.556 --> 40:34.141
about hippopotamuses,
their balls--

40:34.224 --> 40:35.559
<i>All right, all right.
That's just cheating.</i>

40:35.642 --> 40:38.687
Their dicks are about
two feet long.

40:38.770 --> 40:39.938
Sorta pink.

40:40.021 --> 40:42.149
Slimy pink things.

40:42.232 --> 40:44.317
Big bulbous head on it.

41:04.421 --> 41:06.339
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I can...

41:06.423 --> 41:07.966
have your attention, please.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.554
This is a jar

41:12.637 --> 41:14.181
full of gum

41:14.264 --> 41:15.849
from under the tables.

41:15.932 --> 41:17.434
Yeah. Yummy.

41:17.517 --> 41:19.895
Is this a reprimand?

41:19.978 --> 41:20.979
No.

41:21.062 --> 41:22.731
I'm a fun person.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.358
I like to have fun. So...

41:25.442 --> 41:28.236
whoever can correctly guess
how many pieces of chewing gum

41:28.320 --> 41:32.365
are in this jar wins a 12-pack.

41:32.449 --> 41:34.242
We will pass the jar around.

41:34.326 --> 41:35.452
You can write down your guesses

41:35.535 --> 41:37.287
and hand 'em in to your server.

41:40.957 --> 41:43.335
An 11-pack.

You could get another shift
tomorrow night, maybe.

42:36.888 --> 42:37.889
- I hope so.
- Hey, Debs.

42:37.973 --> 42:41.226
- Hi.
- All right...

42:41.309 --> 42:42.852
- There you go.
- Thanks.

42:42.936 --> 42:44.646
Yeah, I can get you more
if you need, all right?

42:44.729 --> 42:46.022
- What's up, Farhad?
- What's up, man?

42:46.106 --> 42:48.024
- This is Farhad.
- Don't-care-had.

42:48.108 --> 42:50.819
Nice to meet you.
And I'm going home.

42:50.902 --> 42:51.945
All right,
I'll see you later.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.822
- Thanks, Debs.
- See you guys.

43:00.537 --> 43:02.539
Huh.

43:02.622 --> 43:04.457
So what do you think?

43:04.541 --> 43:06.042
I mean, this could work, right?

43:06.876 --> 43:08.044
You know, when you
said basement,

43:08.128 --> 43:10.338
I was like, "The only people
who live in basements

43:10.422 --> 43:13.049
are serial killers
or 14-year-olds."

43:13.133 --> 43:15.093
This is way worse.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.053
Smells like something
died down here.

43:17.137 --> 43:19.222
Oh, yeah.
Lots of things died down here.

43:20.599 --> 43:22.851
Were they babies?

43:25.186 --> 43:26.438
No. Dogs.

43:26.521 --> 43:28.064
Ah.

43:28.148 --> 43:30.108
Was this also
a homeless encampment?

43:30.191 --> 43:31.192
Kinda.

43:31.276 --> 43:33.987
Okay, was <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>
filmed down here?

43:34.070 --> 43:35.572
I mean, where's the pit?

43:35.655 --> 43:36.740
You know, it's actually
out back.

43:36.823 --> 43:38.241
Come on, I'll show you.

43:38.325 --> 43:39.576
Come on.

43:42.829 --> 43:44.456
Finally.

43:45.206 --> 43:48.835
The chance to have
what everyone else has.

43:48.918 --> 43:50.420
Children.

43:52.213 --> 43:53.923
You've given me that, Frank.

43:54.007 --> 43:56.885
I don't know that I can
ever thank you enough.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.470
Should we say a little prayer?

44:00.972 --> 44:02.515
That's a great idea.

44:02.599 --> 44:04.643
I'll do it,
since I was Catholic.

44:06.061 --> 44:07.687
Mm.

44:08.938 --> 44:10.815
Heavenly Father,

44:10.899 --> 44:12.859
sweet Mary,

44:12.942 --> 44:16.154
that donkey,
little drummer boy,

44:16.237 --> 44:18.782
as my swimmers swim
through the valley

44:18.865 --> 44:21.368
of the shadow of death,
may they fear no evil.

44:21.451 --> 44:23.703
May my rod and my staff

44:23.787 --> 44:25.372
have power and glory

44:25.455 --> 44:28.750
forever and ever,
amen.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.669
- Amen.
- Amen.

44:30.752 --> 44:32.128
That was beautiful.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.172
Hello, Doctor.

44:34.255 --> 44:35.674
Frank, Ingrid.

44:35.757 --> 44:37.425
How are we looking?

44:39.094 --> 44:40.387
It's a miracle.

44:40.470 --> 44:42.722
Your motility
and concentration scores

44:42.806 --> 44:43.890
are through the roof.

44:43.973 --> 44:45.350
Whoo-hoo!

44:45.433 --> 44:46.851
Some of the highest
I've ever seen.

44:46.935 --> 44:48.895
Yeah. So...

44:48.978 --> 44:50.355
my boys can swim, eh?

44:50.438 --> 44:51.731
Swim?

44:51.815 --> 44:53.191
Whoa.

44:53.274 --> 44:54.859
Hello, laddies.

44:54.943 --> 44:56.945
Half of them tried to leap
out of the Petri dish.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.279
That's my boys.

44:58.363 --> 45:01.032
So, uh, you think
our chances are good?

45:01.116 --> 45:02.117
I'm extremely optimistic.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.201
Whew.

45:03.284 --> 45:04.202
Thank you.

45:04.285 --> 45:05.829
That's amazing.

45:05.912 --> 45:07.455
Th-thank you,
Dr. Kwan.

45:07.539 --> 45:09.290
Don't thank me.
Thank Frank.

45:10.166 --> 45:12.794
Frank, thank you.

45:14.838 --> 45:16.047
- Thank you.
- You bet.

45:16.131 --> 45:17.924
Thank you.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.634
You guys have got
to start living like grown-ups,

45:19.718 --> 45:21.678
and that starts
in the bathroom.

45:21.761 --> 45:23.138
All right.

45:23.221 --> 45:24.848
Okay. All right.

45:24.931 --> 45:27.809
Okay, okay, okay.

45:28.935 --> 45:30.311
So you've got, uh,

45:30.395 --> 45:32.814
a bottle of dishwashing liquid
in the shower

45:32.897 --> 45:34.482
and a bar of soap
with five different colors

45:34.566 --> 45:35.984
of pubes on it.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.236
Wait, you guys can't all
share one bar of soap.

45:38.319 --> 45:39.612
No, no, I don't.

45:39.696 --> 45:41.239
That's why I have
the dishwashing liquid.

45:41.322 --> 45:42.741
Is that why you always
smell like lemons?

45:42.824 --> 45:44.242
Yeah, I like lemons.

45:45.410 --> 45:46.411
Once you're in your 20s,

45:46.494 --> 45:49.205
you should have at least two
bath towels that match.

45:49.289 --> 45:50.874
Now that I'm in my 20s,
I'm just glad

45:50.957 --> 45:52.125
I'm not in fucking jail.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.961
Fair.

45:55.044 --> 45:56.045
Cheers.

45:56.129 --> 45:57.964
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

45:59.132 --> 46:00.592
Oh, uh, miss?

46:00.675 --> 46:01.676
Hi.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.386
Um, I asked for no dressing.

46:04.137 --> 46:06.556
- You sure?
- Yeah, positive.

46:06.639 --> 46:08.099
Yeah, this dressing
contains mayonnaise,

46:08.183 --> 46:09.392
and I'm allergic to eggs.

46:09.476 --> 46:11.352
I'm allergic to people
with allergies.

46:11.436 --> 46:12.771
You don't hear me whining.

46:13.938 --> 46:15.356
Excuse me?

46:15.440 --> 46:17.776
I'd like to speak
to the manager.

46:17.859 --> 46:18.860
Okay.

46:21.488 --> 46:22.739
Hi.

46:22.822 --> 46:23.823
You wanted to speak
to the manager?

46:23.907 --> 46:25.074
What seems to be the problem?

46:25.575 --> 46:27.035
- You're the manager?
- Mm-hmm.

46:27.118 --> 46:30.121
- Well, you're rude.
- Okay.

46:30.205 --> 46:32.540
- Oh, no, are you leaving?
- Yeah.

46:32.624 --> 46:34.083
And I'm never coming back.

46:34.167 --> 46:35.794
Okay, 'cause what
I could really use

46:35.877 --> 46:38.379
are some more customers
who are allergic to food.

46:38.463 --> 46:39.923
Bye.

46:42.967 --> 46:44.302
This is alive.

46:44.385 --> 46:45.970
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let me see.

46:47.055 --> 46:49.432
- What are you doing?
- Sterilizing it.

46:49.516 --> 46:51.059
Just a minute.
Kills the bacteria.

46:51.142 --> 46:53.144
No, you guys.
That's a myth.

46:53.228 --> 46:54.938
It actually creates
super bacteria,

46:55.021 --> 46:56.606
which is even more dangerous.

46:56.689 --> 46:57.774
Oh, you see, we're a bit
more worried about

46:57.857 --> 46:59.692
super-tweaky
meth freaks, so...

46:59.776 --> 47:01.194
Okay, well,
sponges are, like,

47:01.277 --> 47:03.154
five for a dollar,
so you shouldn't have

47:03.238 --> 47:04.405
a maintenance plan
for your sponge.

47:04.489 --> 47:06.115
When it gets dirty,
just throw it away.

47:06.199 --> 47:07.659
Gotcha.

47:07.742 --> 47:09.536
Do you guys reuse your Q-tips?

47:09.619 --> 47:10.703
No, don't answer that.

47:10.787 --> 47:12.956
Also, there's one more thing.

47:14.916 --> 47:16.668
- What is this?
- It's a box of clean underwear.

47:16.751 --> 47:17.961
Yeah, we share our underwear.

47:18.044 --> 47:19.128
I don't have time to fold.
Do you, Debs?

47:19.212 --> 47:21.089
- Nope.
- Oh.

47:21.172 --> 47:22.298
Okay.

47:22.382 --> 47:24.926
All right, I'm a little
surprised I have to say this,

47:25.009 --> 47:28.221
but you guys should each have
your own underwear.

47:28.304 --> 47:29.347
Why do you give a shit?

47:29.430 --> 47:30.515
No one's asking you
to stay here.

47:30.598 --> 47:31.599
You can go.

47:31.683 --> 47:32.684
We had a mom once.

47:32.767 --> 47:33.935
She didn't stick around.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.311
Okay, sorry.

47:35.395 --> 47:36.855
I was just making a suggestion.

47:36.938 --> 47:38.147
So was I.

47:38.231 --> 47:40.859
Hey, I thought I was
the angry one.

47:40.942 --> 47:43.278
- What are you doing?
- Vampire power.

47:43.361 --> 47:45.655
Appliances use electricity
just from being plugged in.

47:45.738 --> 47:46.990
So that's why I'm
going to make sure

47:47.073 --> 47:49.075
shit stays unplugged
from now on.

47:49.158 --> 47:50.201
- That's smart.
- Whoa, watch out.

47:50.285 --> 47:52.161
- Whoa, Jesus.
- What's up?

47:52.245 --> 47:54.330
- Hi.
- Here.

47:54.414 --> 47:57.125
- Where'd you get this from?
- Yeah, I won a bet.

47:59.919 --> 48:01.546
God, you guys, seriously.

48:01.629 --> 48:03.756
We do not need this fan
plugged in.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.383
I could fly a fucking kite
in here.

48:06.092 --> 48:07.427
What...

48:07.510 --> 48:08.928
what the hell is going on?

48:09.012 --> 48:10.597
So for every one of these
we recharge,

48:10.680 --> 48:11.931
we make, like, 15 bucks.

48:12.015 --> 48:13.182
So we're gonna go out
every single day,

48:13.266 --> 48:14.017
collect 'em,
and recharge 'em.

48:14.100 --> 48:15.018
Mm-hmm.

48:15.101 --> 48:16.394
- Carl.
- What?

48:16.477 --> 48:18.396
I just paid an $800
electric bill.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.315
You cannot be charging
scooters in here.

48:20.398 --> 48:21.733
Power's not free.

48:21.816 --> 48:23.651
I'm not using our power.

48:37.665 --> 48:40.001

48:40.084 --> 48:42.045
Hey, just so you know,
the people that live here

48:42.128 --> 48:43.880
have a sign
in their front yard that says

48:43.963 --> 48:45.548
"Drive like your kids
live here."

48:45.632 --> 48:47.634
Plug that fucker in.

48:47.717 --> 48:50.470
<i>♪♪ Hey, gotta get down,
gotta shake it to the ground ♪♪</i>

48:50.553 --> 48:53.723
<i>♪♪ I'm a runaround ♪♪</i>

48:59.729 --> 49:03.191
All right, turn this
into more drinks, please.

49:03.274 --> 49:05.360
Evening, dream team.

49:05.443 --> 49:07.528
Can I get a...

49:07.612 --> 49:09.739
a beer and a bump?

49:12.533 --> 49:15.453
- What?
- That's my stool.

49:17.664 --> 49:19.248
Well, tough shit.
Looks like it's my stool now.

49:19.332 --> 49:20.959
Come on, it's my stool.
That's where I sit.

49:21.042 --> 49:22.794
Come on, let me sit here.

49:22.877 --> 49:25.838
Get--fuck.
All right, fine. Jesus.

49:28.299 --> 49:29.676
Who's the new barback?

49:29.759 --> 49:30.760
That's Santiago.

49:30.843 --> 49:32.804
He's staying with us
until we find his father.

49:32.887 --> 49:34.097
Wh-where'd he come from?

49:34.180 --> 49:35.682
What we thought
was Child Services.

49:35.765 --> 49:38.476
Santiago said that there are
1,000 boys living there.

49:39.060 --> 49:41.020
Got separated
from their families.

49:41.104 --> 49:42.689
Crying, sleeping on the floor.

49:42.772 --> 49:44.440
Wearing tinfoil blankets.

49:44.524 --> 49:46.609
- What the fuck?
- It's like the Trail of Tears.

49:46.693 --> 49:48.403
I don't remember exactly
what that was,

49:48.486 --> 49:50.279
but they wouldn't call it that
if they weren't crying.

49:50.363 --> 49:51.948
Well, they are here
illegally.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.700
They were
escaping violence.

49:53.783 --> 49:56.452
They came to Chicago
to escape violence?

49:56.536 --> 49:58.246
I don't see what
the big deal is.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.081
They got some hot meals,
somewhere to sleep.

50:00.164 --> 50:01.874
It's kind of like
a summer camp for them.

50:01.958 --> 50:03.501
It's gotta be better
than where they came from.

50:03.584 --> 50:06.045
Yeah, Tommy, it's a regular
fucking country club.

50:06.129 --> 50:07.672
What are you doing?

50:07.755 --> 50:09.173
I am not with you on this.

50:11.676 --> 50:14.429
They got separated
from their parents.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.889
You know, their lives
were so shitty

50:16.973 --> 50:19.350
that they risked everything
to come to this country,

50:19.434 --> 50:20.893
of all places.

50:20.977 --> 50:23.062
Yeah, land of the free.

50:23.146 --> 50:24.689
Home of the brave.

50:24.772 --> 50:26.899
Yeah, at least the brave part
is still true.

50:26.983 --> 50:28.651
<i>- ♪♪ Oh, say... ♪♪</i>
- No, no.

50:28.735 --> 50:30.695
<i>Silencio. Por favor.</i>

50:30.778 --> 50:32.155
<i>Silencio.</i>

50:35.241 --> 50:36.826
Can I buy you a drink?

50:37.201 --> 50:38.202
Yes.

50:38.286 --> 50:39.620
Hey, pump the brakes,
cool breeze.

50:39.704 --> 50:40.913
- She's had enough.
- What?

50:40.997 --> 50:42.582
Let the guy buy me a drink

50:42.665 --> 50:44.584
if he wants to buy a girl
a drink.

50:44.667 --> 50:46.836
Two rum and diets, please.

50:48.546 --> 50:51.049
- Do you wanna...party?
- Sure.

50:51.132 --> 50:52.133
No.

50:52.216 --> 50:53.634
Nope, no, no.

50:53.718 --> 50:54.677
Nope.

50:54.761 --> 50:56.054
Nope, nope, no.

50:56.137 --> 50:57.722
Come on.

50:58.181 --> 50:59.348
- What'd I do?
- I don't like you.

50:59.432 --> 51:01.017
But I dropped something.

51:06.814 --> 51:08.566
What the fuck is that?

51:08.649 --> 51:10.068
What? What?

51:10.151 --> 51:11.360
That scratching noise.

51:13.488 --> 51:15.490
I don't hear anything.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.533
Something is crawling around
inside your walls.

51:17.617 --> 51:21.120
It's probably rats
the size of toasters.

51:21.204 --> 51:22.371
There, that.

51:22.455 --> 51:23.873
There it is again.

51:28.169 --> 51:29.378
There.

51:29.462 --> 51:31.005
Fixed it.

51:32.548 --> 51:33.800
<i>Hey, Gallaghers.</i>

51:33.883 --> 51:36.052
<i>Got a present for ya.</i>

51:36.135 --> 51:38.221
Now what?

51:44.102 --> 51:45.770
Shit.

51:45.853 --> 51:47.730
Jesus.

51:48.189 --> 51:50.274
She's fine.
Just passed out.

51:50.358 --> 51:51.901
Sweet dreams, baby girl.

51:51.984 --> 51:53.694
Well, she's all yours.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.154
We gotta get back to the bar.

51:55.238 --> 51:57.323
- Thanks, guys.
- Thanks.

51:57.406 --> 51:59.784
She do this a lot?

51:59.867 --> 52:00.993
Yeah.

52:01.077 --> 52:02.495
Well, lately.

52:22.014 --> 52:24.934
