WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:02.408
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.544 --> 00:04.535
- Aah!

00:04.671 --> 00:05.877
- He's afflicted,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.667
just like the people
you've seen in Haven.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.050
- This is a whole new world.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.541
- Aah!

00:10.677 --> 00:13.089
- I'm not like you.
I don't want to be like you.

00:13.222 --> 00:14.883
- He's pretty tough.
- The troubles are back.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.425
He's gonna have to be
tough as nails.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.549
- You're a smuggler.
- I'm an importer.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.970
- lmporting...illegal goods.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.718
- Everything
is illegal somewhere.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.391
- Julia Carr.
I'm Eleanor's daughter.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.230
Why do the most horrible
things keep happening

00:25.359 --> 00:26.565
in this godforsaken town?

00:26.693 --> 00:28.729
I should never have let you
convince me to come back.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.773
- I find a picture
of the Colorado Kid's death,

00:30.906 --> 00:33.192
and I spend all this time trying
to ID. the woman in the photo

00:33.325 --> 00:35.441
who could be my mom,
and then after all of that,

00:35.577 --> 00:36.908
you tell me you were
in the picture.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.698
- Lucy always
helped those in need.

00:38.830 --> 00:39.740
- You knew my mother?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.409
Boss, I need a few weeks.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.998
There's something
I need to look into.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.161
- No problem.
She's staying.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.955
Maybe she can help you
with your troubles.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.001
- [sighs]
I'm out.

00:51.134 --> 00:54.376
I want to be in,
but my cards won't let me.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.629
- I call.
Bet's to you, Parker.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.723
Call, raise, or cower
from me and fold.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.307
- Smack talk—

01:01.436 --> 01:02.812
the last recourse
of the weak.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.054
- Hey.
- Yeah. His specialty.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.306
All right,
do I make my own day,

01:07.442 --> 01:08.602
or do I ruin all of yours?

01:08.735 --> 01:09.986
- Oh, big talk.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.602
But I don't see
a whole lot of action.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.445
- Miss Parker, do you have,
um, a favorite nut?

01:14.575 --> 01:15.610
- Excuse me?

01:15.742 --> 01:16.902
- I think he means
other than Nathan.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.947
- Cashews, almonds, pecans,
walnuts, macadamias.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.445
- Why do you want to know?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.493
- A nut says a lot
about a person.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.492
- That it does.
So, uh, it'd be...

01:26.628 --> 01:27.834
pistachios.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.295
- Technically not a nut.
That's actually a—a seed.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.289
Some chefs might call it
a culinary nut.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.792
But botanically speaking,
it's not a nut.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.384
Miss Parker will call.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.969
She has to call.
No choice.

01:38.098 --> 01:38.962
Unavoidable.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.259
- And how can you
be so sure?

01:40.392 --> 01:42.132
- Uh...you're not much
for cards.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.805
Uh, never have been.
Tried to be.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.177
Couldn't make it work.

01:45.314 --> 01:47.100
- All right,
as much as I love you

01:47.232 --> 01:49.018
telling me what I am
and what I'm going to do,

01:49.151 --> 01:50.937
you just so happen
to be right, okay?

01:51.069 --> 01:54.061
So...l call.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.323
Three Jacks.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.781
- Two pair!
Three Jacks?

01:57.909 --> 01:59.991
Damn!
- All that big talk.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.906
I thought you'd have
five of a kind.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.825
- F-five of a kind
would require cheating,

02:03.957 --> 02:06.334
and cheaters never prosper.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.373
- Hold on.
He was in the hand.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.791
We get to see those cards.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.630
Let's see how bad it was.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.176
Full house.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.670
Queens over fives.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.183
Hey. You hustling me?

02:22.309 --> 02:24.675
- No, no.
He, uh...

02:24.811 --> 02:27.393
He just...
gets a bit confused.

02:27.522 --> 02:28.898
- Not that confused.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.685
He took all my money
last week,

02:30.817 --> 02:32.023
no matter how good
of a hand I had.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.609
- Yeah. Same here.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.854
Is that what this is, boys?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.526
A con?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.866
I invite you here,
and you try to cheat us?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.655
- No, no, I don't—l—

02:42.788 --> 02:45.200
I felt bad, okay, for...

02:45.332 --> 02:47.789
for taking all your money
last time, so I...

02:47.918 --> 02:49.874
I thought I should lose
for a while.

02:50.003 --> 02:50.958
- [laughs]

02:51.088 --> 02:52.248
Okay, well, in that case,

02:52.381 --> 02:54.713
you can definitely
keep playing, right?

02:54.841 --> 02:56.047
[laughs]

02:56.176 --> 02:58.383
- Yeah, that's
good enough for me.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.180
- I'm, uh, headin' out.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.554
- Nathan, are you hungry?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.477
It's shrimp night
down there at the Gull.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.395
l was thinking of heading over.
You want to come?

03:14.528 --> 03:15.859
- Sorry. I got plans.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.899
- Plans?
What kind of plans?

03:19.032 --> 03:21.569
- Stuff around the house.
- No, you don't.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.784
You don't want to hang out
with your old man,

03:23.912 --> 03:25.698
that's absolutely fine.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.038
But you don't have to lie
to me about it.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.542
- You know what?
Shrimp sounds good.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.374
- Yeah? Maybe we'll split
a pitcher

03:31.503 --> 03:33.209
of that amber ale
he's pourin' down there too?

03:33.338 --> 03:35.203
- Sure.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.416
- Excuse me, uh,
Chief Wuornos?

03:39.553 --> 03:40.588
- Yeah, that's me.
Why?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.712
- I'm looking for
Agent Parker.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.429
- Really?
And who are you?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.344
- Her boss.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.559
Agent Howard.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.394
- Garland Wuornos.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.229
This is my son,
Detective Wuornos.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.768
- Can you tell me
where I might find her?

03:54.901 --> 03:57.438
She's, uh...
not answering her cell.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.277
- Well, no, I can't really
help you out there.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.612
It's her night off.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.447
- How about you?

04:02.576 --> 04:05.113
- No. Like the chief said,
it's her night off.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.452
- I think you do know, son.
Where is she?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.117
- Now, just hang on
a second.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.750
You're not gonna come
waltzing in here

04:10.876 --> 04:12.286
and start leaning
on my men.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.001
If you want some information,
you just come right through me.

04:17.549 --> 04:20.165
- Please ask your officer

04:20.302 --> 04:22.839
where I may find my agent.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.802
- Gee, that was simple,
wasn't it?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.388
Do you know where she is?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.432
- She's at the harbor.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.100
Duke Crocker's boat.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.938
It's The Cape Rouge.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.398
- Thank you.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.142
Nice to meet you, Chief.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.270
- You too.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.648
Feds.
Unbelievable.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.992
Okay. Shrimp night.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.283
Did I say it was shrimp night?

04:50.415 --> 04:51.871
- Would have been nice
to give me a chance

04:52.000 --> 04:53.501
to give her a heads up.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.867
- Why does she need
a heads up?

04:55.003 --> 04:56.868
She's a big girl.
She can take care of herself.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.165
- You know, you go get dinner.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.084
I just remembered
I have some work I should do.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.674
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.346
- What the hell did I do?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.181
- Champagne
for my real friends,

05:10.310 --> 05:11.925
real pain
for my sham friends.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.017
To a life worth living.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.807
- Yeah.
- I'll drink to that.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.022
[glasses clinking]

05:20.320 --> 05:21.355
- All right.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.194
So is there a signal
in this rust bucket?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.609
- Whoa!
Rust bucket?

05:28.286 --> 05:30.151
- Deal me out.
- You gotta call the wifey?

05:30.288 --> 05:31.869
- [laughs]
That I do.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.330
- Uh, same-sex marriage is
illegal in the state of Maine.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.417
Is she from Vermont?
'Cause it's legal in Vermont.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.381
l was joking.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.667
- Hey, what's up?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.291
- Agent Howard was here
looking for you.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.839
- Here in Haven?

05:46.972 --> 05:49.509
- Yes. Here in Haven.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.932
It's time to come home.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.725
[haunting music]

06:00.861 --> 06:08.859
J‘J‘

06:32.058 --> 06:33.514
- You haven't returned
my calls.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.680
Makes me think you're...
avoiding me.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.930
- Been busy...on a case.
- Not good enough.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.024
I let you take a leave
if you promised to do what?

06:43.153 --> 06:45.144
- Call in regularly.
- And...

06:45.280 --> 06:47.271
- Write up reports.
- Of which you did neither.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.773
- I filed reports.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.366
With Chief Wuornos.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.327
- You're on loan here, Parker.
You still work for the FBI.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.536
Now, if you've forgotten that,

06:55.665 --> 06:57.166
it's time for you
to go back to Boston.

06:57.292 --> 07:00.159
- No, no, I still have work
that I need to do here in Haven.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.455
- Drinking and playing cards
is work.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.499
- I've been working
my ass off.

07:03.632 --> 07:04.747
- Really? Doing what?

07:04.883 --> 07:06.623
- I'll put it
in my next report.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.628
My extremely detailed,
very long report.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.595
- Tell you what.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.307
Let's make it
a verbal report.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.801
- Now?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.303
- Now.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.681
- Really, I don't—
I don't know where to start.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.520
There have been...

07:27.656 --> 07:29.772
things going on here.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.524
- Things that...didn't make it
into a report?

07:32.661 --> 07:35.243
- Yeah. Things like that.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.910
- Keep talking.
- People do things in Haven.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.077
- What things?

07:40.210 --> 07:41.746
- There was a woman

07:41.878 --> 07:44.995
whose moods
affected the weather.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.338
There was a kid

07:47.467 --> 07:49.503
whose nightmares came true.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.001
- Interesting.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.549
- Isn't this the part where
you call me crazy or a liar?

07:53.682 --> 07:55.263
- You don't ask questions here,
Parker.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.759
You answer them.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.227
Let me show you something.

08:03.650 --> 08:07.188
- Wow. That's a lot of...
gadgets for a conversation.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.108
- Depends on the conversation.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.232
Your official police reports.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.780
None of what you just told me
is in any of them.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.153
Care to explain that?

08:18.289 --> 08:20.621
[door slams]

08:20.750 --> 08:21.910
- Hello?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.329
Hello?

08:31.177 --> 08:34.465
Hey! Hello?

08:34.597 --> 08:35.848
Hello?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.938
- You're in luck.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.228
- I already ate.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.570
- No, you didn't.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.778
You know, Nathan,
l was kind of hoping that...

08:59.914 --> 09:01.905
well...

09:02.042 --> 09:03.452
l—l had something
to say to you.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.667
I was hoping to say it
to you over dinner.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.332
Of course, we couldn't
even get that together.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.080
- What's that?

09:10.216 --> 09:11.422
- Well, maybe it's more
something

09:11.551 --> 09:12.757
that you want to say to me.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.672
I feel that you have something
you want to say to me,

09:14.804 --> 09:16.385
and it's been building up
for a while and...

09:16.514 --> 09:18.095
well, I'd like to hear it.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.089
- What makes you think
I have something to say to you?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.842
- Because you're my son.
I pay attention.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.145
- Okay.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.778
You knew.
- I knew what?

09:37.911 --> 09:41.278
- The troubles.
You knew they were back.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.826
You knew I had this—
this—whatever this is—

09:43.958 --> 09:45.619
and you never said anything.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.708
- 'Cause you weren't ready
to hear it.

09:47.837 --> 09:52.922
And when you got whatever it is,
this thing that you got...

09:55.261 --> 09:57.468
What did you do?
You went to see the doctor.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.464
- I couldn't feel anything.
I thought I was sick.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.886
And he agreed with me.
He even had a name for it.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.135
- You were hoping you were sick,
but you knew better.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.136
Maybe you didn't know
when you were eight years old,

10:07.273 --> 10:09.264
but you sure as hell knew
this time around.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.776
And what did you do?

10:10.902 --> 10:13.393
You chose to ignore something
that was right in front of you,

10:13.530 --> 10:14.986
and when a cop does that,
what happens?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.480
He gets himself killed.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.732
- Okay.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.359
Maybe I was in denial.

10:21.496 --> 10:24.829
So how about calling me on it
instead of ignoring me?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.789
How about a little
fatherly advice?

10:26.918 --> 10:28.783
- You haven't listened
to anything I've had to say

10:28.920 --> 10:30.581
since you were a little kid.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.328
- Oh, yeah.
Right, so...

10:32.465 --> 10:33.841
yeah, it's my fault.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.707
- Forget it.
Just never mind.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.631
All right?
Let's just forget it.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.180
- Thought you'd say that.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.515
- You call.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.100
You call.
That would be

10:46.229 --> 10:49.187
ten winning hands
in a row.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.691
What are you up to?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.432
- Easy, Duke.
It's cool.

10:52.569 --> 10:53.934
- I don't cheat.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.779
But l'm...pretty sure
I'm gonna win this one too.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.904
- I am going to...

11:02.036 --> 11:04.413
- [singsong]
J‘ You should fold J‘

11:05.832 --> 11:07.322
You're gonna lose anyway.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.914
You don't want to waste
any more money.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.294
Money is valuable.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.503
- Or it's a bluff.
A really weird bluff.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.167
- I call.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.922
Gah!

11:24.058 --> 11:25.559
- I told you.
I did.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.721
- Yes, you did.
I gotta tell you.

11:27.854 --> 11:31.142
l—l have never seen a player
quite like you before.

11:31.274 --> 11:34.016
And no offense—
I hope I never see one again!

11:35.528 --> 11:36.938
I'm out.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.687
Good night.
- Wait, Duke.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.904
One more hand.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.990
- No, thank you.
I'm out.

11:43.119 --> 11:46.236
- Hey, I'll put double
what I won into the pot.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.078
Double this
times two.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.869
And I'll even give you
an extra draw,

11:50.001 --> 11:51.787
which is also times two.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.751
- [laughs]

11:55.715 --> 11:56.955
Why would you do that?

11:57.091 --> 12:00.049
- You have something
that I want—uh, need.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.045
It's, uh...
it's important to me.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.762
Yeah, big-time important.
Really big.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.347
See? I got my reasons.
Right?

12:06.476 --> 12:08.967
-So...

12:09.103 --> 12:10.354
youin?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.266
- Hmm.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.611
What do you want?

12:24.827 --> 12:26.283
- You already tried it.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.198
No reception
inside a metal boat.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.372
And they're sealed shut.
You tried them too.

12:32.502 --> 12:35.084
- Well, if at first
you don't

12:35.213 --> 12:36.623
[grunts]
succeed”.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.792
- Parker, I want
some answers out of you,

12:38.925 --> 12:40.131
and I want them now.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.467
- I think we should try
to get out of here first.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.964
- And I'd like you to stop
avoiding my questions.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.715
So...

12:48.851 --> 12:50.102
about your police reports.

12:50.228 --> 12:53.561
- Oh, yes.
Let's talk about that some more.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.978
- When you wrote in your report
that two men died of old age,

12:58.111 --> 12:59.226
you meant—

12:59.362 --> 13:01.978
- They aged several decades
in a few days.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.651
- And the guy
that lived on the boat—

13:03.783 --> 13:04.943
- Duke.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.532
- You wrote that he was admitted
to the hospital with—

13:06.661 --> 13:08.868
- With an acute
vitamin deficiency.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.862
- Vitamin deficiency.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.159
- That's what the doctor
called it.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.623
- Watch your tone, Parker.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.458
I'm here to debrief you
and possibly reassign you,

13:16.587 --> 13:19.044
but I can easily have you
brought before committee...

13:19.173 --> 13:20.834
if that's how
you want to play it.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.302
- All right.
What else do you want to know?

13:32.895 --> 13:34.510
- Unbelievable.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.184
- I had a feeling he was gonna
go for the flush.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.229
Lots of feelings about it,
actually—tons.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.771
- How nice for you.

13:41.904 --> 13:45.067
- So, uh...
we can collect on that

13:45.199 --> 13:46.860
and be gone

13:46.993 --> 13:49.075
far, far away.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.616
- Finally.
A silver lining.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.114
Julia, would you care
to join me

13:54.250 --> 13:55.786
while I fetch this
for these boys?

13:55.918 --> 13:59.911
- Uh, it's kind of nice out.
I think I'll stay up...

14:01.591 --> 14:04.833
Company it is.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.807
- So what did you lose
exacﬂy?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.804
I never saw
what he wrote down.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.932
- What?
Oh, uh...

14:21.069 --> 14:23.025
It was a baseball card.
A rare one.

14:23.154 --> 14:25.520
- Since when do you collect
baseball cards?

14:25.656 --> 14:27.362
- I don't.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.403
But I don't think
that's what they came for.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.196
- Then why are we down here?
What are we doing?

14:31.329 --> 14:33.069
- I don't have time
to explain right now.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.337
I was afraid
that might happen.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.501
click!
[engine rumbles]

14:47.095 --> 14:49.336
[engine rumbling]

14:49.472 --> 14:51.463
Son of a bitch!

14:51.599 --> 14:52.884
- I hate to bring this up,

14:53.017 --> 14:55.724
but if you thought that was
gonna happen, then why did you—

14:55.853 --> 14:58.765
- Let it?

14:58.898 --> 15:01.310
Believe me,
it wasn't my first choice.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.058
But it did seem better than
leaving you alone with them.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.480
- You think
they want your boat?

15:05.613 --> 15:07.729
- I don't know
what they want.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.527
But I know what I got.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.572
Options.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.456
- Is this your friend's
idea of a joke?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.253
- Duke wouldn't pull this
with you on board.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.468
He's not interested
in pissing off the FBI.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.132
- Well, someone locked us
in the stateroom

15:32.265 --> 15:33.425
and is taking us to sea.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.594
- Yes, they are.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.056
- What are you looking for?

15:40.189 --> 15:43.272
- [muttering]

15:43.401 --> 15:44.641
Aha.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.486
Foundit
Sir, I need you to step back.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.775
Thank you.
- What are you doing?

15:53.411 --> 15:55.151
- Making a phone call.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.997
Okay.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.490
Damn it!

16:00.626 --> 16:03.117
We're too far from shore.
- Not a bad idea.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.915
Would have been better
if you'd thought of it

16:05.047 --> 16:07.003
when we were in the harbor.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.499
- I'm gonna send a text.
- With no signal.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.422
- I'm not gonna send it
from here.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.306
- What's this I hear
on the radio?

16:17.435 --> 16:19.847
They got the harbor master
out there looking for Audrey?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.594
- I asked her to go check
Duke's slip, yeah.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.187
She said it would take her
a little while

16:23.316 --> 16:24.305
to get down there.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.522
- Why? What's up?

16:25.651 --> 16:27.061
- Audrey's not
answering her phone.

16:27.195 --> 16:29.151
- Aren't you taking this a
little personal with the phone?

16:29.280 --> 16:30.986
- Can't get ahold of Duke
or Julia either.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.980
They were all together
at the poker game.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.732
- They're probably
all passed out, drunk.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.530
- Yeah, maybe.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.654
Maybe I'm just seeing
what's in front of me.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.530
Quiet cell phone.
Radio silence.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.374
Parker hasn't checked in
in hours.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.914
Doesn't feel right.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.628
- She's your partner.
She's not your girlfriend.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.213
Just let her have
her little girl's night out.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.707
- Parker doesn't have
a girl's night.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.674
All she ever does is work.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.714
- So you think she's working
out there on the boat?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.054
- Don't know why she wouldn't
tell me if she was.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.639
- Maybe she just hasn't
got enough to...

16:58.768 --> 16:59.757
get you involved.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.431
- It's password-protected.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.349
Come on, Parker.
Where's the trust?

17:04.482 --> 17:06.689
- He's trying to hack into
her personal files,

17:06.817 --> 17:08.273
and he's worried
about trust issues.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.903
[keys clicking]

17:10.029 --> 17:11.394
Try the mother's name.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.271
Lucy.
- [scoffs]

17:13.407 --> 17:14.658
- Just try it.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.371
- What do you know?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.912
- See, now, I may not be
the best father in the world,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.410
but there's a reason
I'm the chief.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.092
- I'll give you points
for improvising,

17:35.221 --> 17:36.631
but you know the odds
that this will work

17:36.764 --> 17:37.799
are slim to none.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.923
- Well, you know...

17:40.059 --> 17:42.471
it's a government phone,
right?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.980
So...

17:45.106 --> 17:47.939
what the hell?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.682
Okay.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.863
Yeah.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.608
- I knew this would
come in handy.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.952
- You have an escape hatch
in your storage room?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.116
- It's a ship's hold.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.956
And, yes, I do.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.791
I put it there myself.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.126
- Why would you even
think of that?

18:09.255 --> 18:10.119
- Look...

18:10.256 --> 18:12.121
- Hello in there.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.466
I gotta say, dude,
this is really smart.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.584
click!

18:16.721 --> 18:17.961
So smart.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.928
Just awesome.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.429
- He took my bullets.

18:26.772 --> 18:27.887
He took...

18:28.024 --> 18:31.608
All my bullets!

18:31.736 --> 18:33.146
How did they even
know about this?

18:33.279 --> 18:36.021
I built it myself!

18:36.157 --> 18:37.772
These guys have been
one step ahead of me

18:37.908 --> 18:40.160
ever since I met them,
which is both annoying...

18:40.286 --> 18:41.150
clack!

18:41.287 --> 18:42.493
And insulting.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.658
- And just how did you meet
these fine gentlemen?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.655
- A friend introduced us.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.453
Said they liked to play
poken

18:48.586 --> 18:50.577
- Did he also say they liked
to kidnap their opponents

18:50.713 --> 18:52.544
and drag them out
into the open sea?

18:52.673 --> 18:55.005
- I'm picking up
on your sarcasm.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.341
I didn't think
this was gonna happen.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.677
I thought we'd play cards,
I'd make a little money,

18:59.805 --> 19:01.841
and a good time
would be had by all.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.089
- So why did this friend

19:03.225 --> 19:05.011
not tell you the truth
about these guys?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.384
- I understand the confusion.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.556
When I say friend...
I don't actually mean friend.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.146
I mean more like...
business associate.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.685
- A trusted
business associate?

19:12.818 --> 19:15.195
- Trust is flexible
in my line of work.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.028
- Which is what, exactly,
Duke...

19:18.157 --> 19:20.694
your line of work?

19:22.036 --> 19:23.401
- Okay.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.152
Well...

19:25.289 --> 19:27.746
I buy things.
I sell things.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.366
Sometimes
I just deliver things.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.710
- Like boxes.
- Like boxes.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.170
- What's in them?
- I don't know.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.836
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just boxes.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.094
- Yet you deliver them.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.756
- Well, now, does FedEx
know what's inside

19:40.888 --> 19:42.389
of every package they deliver?

19:42.515 --> 19:44.176
- No, they don't,
but they don't keep arsenals

19:44.308 --> 19:46.219
or build escape hatches
in their stores.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.059
And they ask what's in
the packages they deliver.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.769
- Which is why
they can't do what I do.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.354
You're overreacting.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.724
- Maybe we should open—

19:56.070 --> 19:58.106
- Don't do that.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.900
- Doesn't it bother you

20:00.032 --> 20:02.193
that there may be ugly things
in your boxes?

20:02.326 --> 20:04.533
- It's none of my business.

20:04.662 --> 20:09.076
And it's definitely
none of yours.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.549
- Shall we continue?

20:20.678 --> 20:21.884
- Let's.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.263
- These people
you're talking about—

20:23.389 --> 20:24.469
- I can't arrest them.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.054
- Parker, do yourself a favor.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.299
Stop interrupting your boss.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.677
- Sorry.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.053
Sir.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.929
- These people...

20:34.066 --> 20:36.102
what do you call them?

20:36.235 --> 20:37.645
- The afflicted,

20:37.778 --> 20:39.234
the cursed,

20:39.363 --> 20:40.899
the troubled.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.771
The people that don't end up
in these reports—

20:42.908 --> 20:44.284
I can't arrest them.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.992
- If they commit a crime,
you can and should.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.327
You swore an oath.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.616
- To uphold the law.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.239
But we don't have laws
for these people.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.787
- They're US. citizens?
- Yes.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.786
- Then we have laws
for them.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.708
- All right.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.957
[laughs]

21:01.093 --> 21:04.927
A man plays music,
and it drives people insane.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.341
What do I arrest him for?

21:07.475 --> 21:09.261
Another man's shadow—

21:09.393 --> 21:12.009
his shadow kills people.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.761
What do I charge him with?

21:13.898 --> 21:15.434
- I don't care.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.308
All I care about is that you
take them out of circulation.

21:18.444 --> 21:21.231
Leave the moral issues
to the lawyers.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.915
[cell phone buzzing]

21:35.169 --> 21:37.160
- Harbormaster just called.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.627
Duke's boat's
not in the harbor.

21:38.756 --> 21:41.839
- Just got a text from Audrey.
She's trapped on board.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.423
- Call the Coast Guard.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.197
- [tapping]
There's gotta be

22:11.330 --> 22:14.037
a secret panel
or a chamber here somewhere.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.202
- A secret panel?
- Yeah.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.075
Duke always has a plan B.

22:18.212 --> 22:19.827
- Sounds like you two
are pretty friendly.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.080
- [chuckles] Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

22:22.216 --> 22:23.831
- You know, your friend
has a sheet

22:23.968 --> 22:26.050
going back a long way.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.884
- Doesn't surprise me.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.846
He's actually been
pretty useful on these cases.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.011
- That right there
is reason enough

22:33.143 --> 22:35.008
for me to pull you off
this assignment.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.181
If these cases are as delicate
as you say they are,

22:37.314 --> 22:38.895
they should be handled
by a special detail,

22:39.024 --> 22:40.400
not you and a felon.

22:46.156 --> 22:50.866
- That felon just gave me
a way to save our asses...sir.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.207
- Think I know why
Audrey's on that boat.

22:58.335 --> 22:59.745
She was looking into
a couple of guys

22:59.879 --> 23:02.245
who were barred from casinos
up and down the East Coast.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.589
But why would she be
investigating poker cheats?

23:05.718 --> 23:07.629
- And why are poker cheats
playing low-stakes poker

23:07.761 --> 23:09.092
on Duke's boat?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.757
- And why is she now
trapped on the boat?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.596
- Sounds like you still got
more questions

23:12.725 --> 23:14.932
than what you got answers.
- Do you got answers?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.972
'Cause I'm all ears
if you do.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.470
I'm headin' out.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.188
- No, you're not.
You're not going nowhere.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.273
You're staying right here.
No, what are you gonna do?

23:23.402 --> 23:24.608
You gonna get yourself a boat

23:24.737 --> 23:27.524
and then go out there and search
the entire Atlantic Ocean?

23:27.656 --> 23:29.271
Just let the Coast Guard
do it.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.614
They're equipped
to handle this.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.279
You wanted my advice.
There it is.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.527
Pretend you're her father.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.370
You're gonna sit by the radio
and be ready to act.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.706
And suffer.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.127
clack!

23:51.263 --> 23:52.924
- You really
just gonna sit there?

23:56.393 --> 23:57.678
- I'd join you,

23:57.811 --> 23:59.847
but I don't know that little
dance you're doing.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.517
- If they're gonna kill us,
just tell me now.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.981
Don't try to protect me.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.476
- They're not going to kill us.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.524
We're no good to them dead.

24:09.657 --> 24:10.988
- We're good to them alive?

24:11.116 --> 24:13.448
- They didn't come here
to play poker.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.488
They must have cased the boat

24:15.621 --> 24:17.828
and come back for a box.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.948
One that isn't here.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.996
- Where is it?
- Where is it, indeed?

24:23.128 --> 24:24.504
- And if they insist?

24:24.630 --> 24:26.871
- Well, it wouldn't be
the first time.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.963
- What happened to you?

24:29.093 --> 24:31.960
- I'm not sure
I get your meaning.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.468
- You were a big dreamer guy.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.465
You had all these plans.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.467
HoW'd you end up here?

24:40.604 --> 24:42.936
- I happen to like it here.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.566
- So this is who you are now.

24:47.695 --> 24:50.858
[laughs] I used to think
you were the coolest guy.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.733
Turns out
you're just a petty crook.

24:55.869 --> 24:59.202
- No.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.367
I'm an exceptional crook.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.832
- You're a delivery boy.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.076
- Sweetheart,
calling me names

25:05.212 --> 25:06.748
isn't gonna get us anywhere
right now.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.839
[wood creaking]

25:14.013 --> 25:16.004
Do you feel that?

25:16.140 --> 25:17.380
- What?

25:19.810 --> 25:21.846
- We're starting to list.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.391
We must have sprung a leak.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.231
My boat is leaking.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.227
If somebody doesn't fix it,

25:32.364 --> 25:33.865
we sink.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.255
- Did you find the box?
- No.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.546
I keep thinking like Duke.
I know he'd hide the box.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.543
I know he'd put it
in a special spot,

25:56.680 --> 25:57.840
but every time I think
of a spot—

25:57.973 --> 25:59.588
- You can't find it.
- I can't find it!

25:59.725 --> 26:01.556
- I thought you could
ask a man a couple questions

26:01.685 --> 26:02.720
and know exactly
what they're gonna do.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.435
- I can.
I usually can, I—

26:05.564 --> 26:07.145
I haven't always been able
to do this, okay?

26:07.274 --> 26:08.559
I'm still figuring it out.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.102
- Well, now is
a perfect time, brainiac!

26:10.235 --> 26:12.146
This was supposed to be
a simple robbery.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.735
Now we got two
federal agents locked up.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.729
- Well, I wouldn't worry
about them.

26:15.866 --> 26:16.946
- What? Why?
Why not?

26:17.076 --> 26:18.612
- Uh...l'd worry about
the boat.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.406
It's—it's sinking.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.119
We gotta—
we gotta turn this thing around.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.784
-Or...

26:24.917 --> 26:27.624
we speed this thing up.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.584
Let's go have a talk
with Duke.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.456
- Let's say I believe you,
which I don't.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.378
But let's imagine

26:35.511 --> 26:37.627
everything you've said
about this place is true.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.470
Why should I waste
the bureau's time and your...

26:40.599 --> 26:43.306
not inconsiderable talents
on this nothing little town?

26:43.435 --> 26:45.596
- Because
I understand these people.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.596
For some reason, I can...
I can talk to them,

26:48.732 --> 26:52.475
and I can help them.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.851
Not all of them.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.648
- We're dealing with killers
and terrorists

26:55.781 --> 26:57.146
in the real world

26:57.282 --> 26:59.614
while you're here holding hands
with the children of the corn.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.861
that was chasing aliens—
what was his name?

27:03.997 --> 27:05.203
- Hey, he was a genius.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.493
What happened to him the last
few years was a tragedy,

27:07.626 --> 27:09.366
but that's beside
the point.

27:09.503 --> 27:10.709
- Okay, you know what
the point is?

27:10.838 --> 27:11.998
The point is

27:12.131 --> 27:13.996
is that I'm good working
on these cases, all right?

27:14.133 --> 27:16.499
I wasn't great
in the real world.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.251
- [laughs] And your methods
were unorthodox,

27:19.388 --> 27:20.377
to put it mildly.

27:20.514 --> 27:22.505
- Well, I appreciate
the kindness.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.132
- You were a good agent.
You still are.

27:25.269 --> 27:28.306
So unless you can give me
one good reason

27:28.438 --> 27:29.769
why I should let you
stay here,

27:29.898 --> 27:31.729
you're reporting back
to Boston ASAP—

27:31.859 --> 27:33.224
- Hold that thought.

27:33.360 --> 27:37.148
I've got some unorthodox
escaping to do.

27:41.326 --> 27:44.944
Hey, you mind if! borrow
some of your toys?

27:47.624 --> 27:50.206
- Duke, tell them.
It's just a box.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.916
- It's not their box.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.581
- My arm's getting
a little tired.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.705
But I can keep going.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.331
Where's the box?

28:02.181 --> 28:03.546
- Now...

28:03.682 --> 28:04.888
what box?

28:05.017 --> 28:06.348
- You—you're angry.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.558
You shouldn't be.
Bad for your blood pressure...

28:08.687 --> 28:10.052
and other things.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.181
- As a matter of fact,
you stealing my boat

28:13.317 --> 28:15.433
and taking my friends hostage

28:15.569 --> 28:17.605
is what's bad
for my blood pressure.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.148
But thanks for asking.

28:20.908 --> 28:21.943
- I don't care!

28:22.075 --> 28:24.566
In fact,
I'm a little bored.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.568
- Yeah, me too.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.912
- Take him back on deck.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.952
Leave her.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.621
- You touch her...

28:33.754 --> 28:36.496
and I'm gonna start
to take this personally.

28:39.843 --> 28:40.832
- Come here!

28:43.013 --> 28:44.344
Have a seat.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.436
[Julia screams]

28:52.564 --> 28:55.271
- I'll give you guys
whatever you want.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.310
You just let her go.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.775
- Okay.
Where's the box?

28:58.904 --> 29:00.986
- Let Julia go first.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.105
- I can't.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.654
See...l don't trust you,

29:05.786 --> 29:07.492
and you don't trust me.

29:07.621 --> 29:10.283
But you're gonna tell me
where that box is anyway.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.155
- Why would I do that?

29:12.292 --> 29:13.793
- Because you can't
keep this up forever.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.284
- Keep what up?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.291
- Uh...uh...

29:18.423 --> 29:21.130
elephants, donkeys,
and zebras, huh?

29:21.260 --> 29:23.000
Penguins, crocodiles,
and snakes.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.467
[laughs]
Yeah, that's it.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.427
Keep it up, man.
Keep trying to think of the zoo.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.262
Don-don't think of the box.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.007
Don't think of the box.
Ah...

29:30.143 --> 29:32.179
Naked girls on trapezes

29:32.312 --> 29:34.018
in leotards?

29:34.147 --> 29:35.933
Whoa.
You—you got a dirty mind.

29:36.066 --> 29:37.647
Now, fill in the blanks.
Fill in the blanks.

29:37.776 --> 29:38.936
Fill in the blanks.

29:42.990 --> 29:46.699
[laughing]

29:46.827 --> 29:49.193
Thank you.
Thank you.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.786
[chortling]

29:51.915 --> 29:55.123
[m utters]

29:55.252 --> 29:57.117
Spasibo.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.626
Ha ha!

30:05.762 --> 30:07.343
Ha ha ha!

30:15.147 --> 30:16.728
- Hey.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.893
We've got the item.
We're heading back to Haven now.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.891
- I've got your money.
How long before you get here?

30:21.028 --> 30:24.145
- We're 20 miles southwest
of Little Tall Island,

30:24.281 --> 30:25.942
bearing 2-3-0.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.689
40 minutes.
- 40 minutes?

30:27.826 --> 30:30.317
Why so long?
- Crocker's boat's sinking.

30:30.454 --> 30:31.569
Might not make it to shore.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.161
Might just be the two of us
in a dinghy.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.201
- Copy that.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.172
- [softly]
Nathan.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.421
Nathan, can you hear me?

30:50.557 --> 30:52.013
Nathan.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.057
- Audrey?
Where are you?

30:55.187 --> 30:58.520
- I'm about 20 minutes
southwest of Little Tall Island,

30:58.648 --> 30:59.933
bearing 2-3-0.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.398
- 2-3-0?
Okay, let me call it in.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.518
- Duke's boat has been
taken over by an Ezra Colbert

31:04.654 --> 31:07.487
and a Tobias Blaine,
spelled E-Z—

31:07.616 --> 31:10.653
- l-l know who they are.
I read your file on 'em.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.071
- I knew that password
was too easy.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.570
- Why didn't you tell me
you were looking into them?

31:14.706 --> 31:15.786
- I'm sorry.
I should have.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.372
I thought that maybe
one of them was troubled

31:17.501 --> 31:18.786
and that maybe they were
card sharks,

31:18.919 --> 31:20.329
but I didn't think
they were kidnappers.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.248
I wanted to dig a little deeper
before I went to you.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.838
- Well, I did some digging too.
The news isn't good.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.378
- Talk quick.
- Looks like Ezra spent a year

31:27.511 --> 31:30.344
in a psychiatric facility
for the emotionally disturbed.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.962
- What was
the doctor's diagnosis?

31:32.099 --> 31:33.635
- Unknown mania and depression,

31:33.767 --> 31:37.055
compounded by bouts
of acuity and prescience.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.643
- That's doctor speak
for troubled.

31:38.772 --> 31:42.264
- Yeah, what kind of diagnosis
is "unusual prescience"?

31:42.401 --> 31:43.937
- I think I know.
I've seen it.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.980
It's like he can anticipate
what you're gonna think

31:46.113 --> 31:47.728
before you think it.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.113
Hey, I gotta go.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.857
Thank you.
That was a huge help.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.279
- Audrey, Audrey.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.489
- Coast Guard's on their way.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.036
Nice work here, son.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.124
- She's still on that boat.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.619
You better hang on
to that gold star.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.212
- I'm trying here, Nathan.
I really am.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.423
- It's a little too late.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.088
- Nathan.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.835
Wait.

32:11.972 --> 32:14.384
Nathan.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.131
Listen to me.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.554
Look, l-l'm not gonna
live forever.

32:18.687 --> 32:21.269
I know you hate me now,

32:21.398 --> 32:23.263
but there's gonna come a day
when you're gonna wish

32:23.400 --> 32:25.516
you'd just taken the chance
to make nice with your old man.

32:25.652 --> 32:26.641
- So just like that,

32:26.778 --> 32:28.154
you want me to look
at the last 30 years

32:28.280 --> 32:31.272
and just let bygones
be bygones?

32:31.408 --> 32:33.239
- We're never gonna get along,
are we?

32:33.368 --> 32:35.859
It's kind of sad,
'cause we used to,

32:35.996 --> 32:37.782
back in the day.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.166
- Oh, don't bring her
into this.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.657
- Why shouldn't I
bring her into this?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.124
She's your mother.
We both miss her.

32:43.253 --> 32:44.914
- I said don't!
- So you think that's it?

32:45.046 --> 32:48.129
That if she were alive today,
that she'd be able to fix us?

32:48.258 --> 32:49.794
- Yeah, that's it.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.008
It's her fault.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.174
The selfish bitch died...

32:55.307 --> 32:57.764
left you alone
with your idiot son.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.305
So you—
you did your best,

33:00.437 --> 33:01.677
which meant ignoring him

33:01.813 --> 33:05.397
until he stopped looking
your way for much of anything.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.317
Well,
that's what you wanted.

33:09.446 --> 33:12.233
You know what, Chief?
That's what you got.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.442
- I'm sorry, Nathan.

33:17.579 --> 33:20.696
I really am.
I don't know what to tell you.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.242
I'm sorry.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.366
- Yeah.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.334
Me too.

33:34.054 --> 33:35.339
- 40 minutes.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.337
- Shut up!

33:37.474 --> 33:39.430
Just...everybody shut up!

33:39.559 --> 33:41.936
Why can't you be quiet
for a little while?

33:42.062 --> 33:44.053
My head is full
and it hurts,

33:44.189 --> 33:45.975
and everybody keeps
putting stuff in it!

33:46.107 --> 33:48.063
- All right.
All right.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.308
I'm gonna leave you

33:49.444 --> 33:51.560
to commune with the fish
for a while.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.027
Hmm?
- Yeah, okay.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.272
Good. Yeah, fish—
fish are quiet.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.194
- Yeah.

34:35.323 --> 34:37.359
- Well, well, it's the cavalry.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.108
You know, I always saw 'em
coming to get me, not save me.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.406
- Shh!
- HoW'd you get out?

34:42.539 --> 34:44.495
- Your escape hatch.

34:44.624 --> 34:47.161
Man, great poker game, huh?
Those guys rock.

34:47.294 --> 34:50.127
- Okay, yeah, they didn't
come here for poker.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.461
They came here for something

34:51.590 --> 34:53.171
that I had hidden very,
very well

34:53.300 --> 34:55.336
but somehow
Ezra figured it out.

34:55.468 --> 34:57.333
- Yeah, but see,
I think that that's his thing.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.961
I think that's why
he's so all over the place

35:00.098 --> 35:03.056
is that he can figure out
what people are gonna do.

35:03.184 --> 35:06.517
- l knew—l knew it.
I'm just sayin'.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.853
So what, he's like some kind
of mind reader or something?

35:08.982 --> 35:10.688
- No, he's not—
he's not quite a mind reader.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.604
I think it's that he can
tell where you're gonna go

35:13.737 --> 35:15.648
and what you're going to do.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.611
But it just—it scrambles
his brain a lot.

35:17.741 --> 35:18.730
- So how do you beat somebody

35:18.867 --> 35:20.607
who always knows
what your next move is?

35:20.744 --> 35:21.984
- I'm not sure, but I'm...

35:22.120 --> 35:24.361
I think I got something.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.284
- Oh, um...
by the way.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.203
My boat is sinking.

35:29.336 --> 35:32.123
So you may just want to...

35:32.255 --> 35:34.496
you know,
factor that in.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.918
- Yeah.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.974
- [whispering]
I really hope this works.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.563
You hear me, Buddha?

35:52.692 --> 35:56.276
Let this work.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.359
[whistles]

35:57.489 --> 35:59.070
- Hey.

35:59.199 --> 36:00.860
HoW'd he get loose, Ez?
- I don't know.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.107
- Abracadabra.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.369
- Well, you forgot to

36:03.495 --> 36:05.076
actually escape there,
Houdini.

36:05.205 --> 36:07.070
- Hey!
Don't come any closer.

36:07.207 --> 36:09.323
- Why not?
- Because...

36:09.459 --> 36:11.450
Whaa. . .whaah!

36:14.631 --> 36:15.541
Uhh...

36:15.674 --> 36:16.538
Huh!

36:16.675 --> 36:18.836
I got moves
that Ralph Macchio,

36:18.968 --> 36:22.005
the Karate Kid himself,
never dreamed of.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.799
And James Brown,
for that matter.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.218
- What's happening, Ez?
- I don't know! I don't know!

36:26.351 --> 36:29.263
It's like it's...
his head is totally blank

36:29.396 --> 36:31.011
and there's nothin' there!
- Hey.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.262
That's just not nice.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.479
- Tie him up.
Tie him up!

36:33.608 --> 36:35.223
- You tie him up, man.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.896
For all I know, he—
he's got a gun

36:37.028 --> 36:38.404
underneath the crazy...

36:38.530 --> 36:40.612
- Why don't I just shoot him?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:40.740 --> 36:42.276
Now, bad form.
I don't even have a gun.

36:42.409 --> 36:44.445
I'm unarmed!
- Now, Duke,

36:44.577 --> 36:47.944
I need you to do
exactly what I say.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.696
And don't think.
Strip.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.666
- All right, all right.
LooKlooKlook

36:53.795 --> 36:55.126
See?

36:55.255 --> 36:56.540
See?
-Ez...

36:56.673 --> 36:59.164
- Nothing, okay?
You happy?

36:59.300 --> 37:01.165
Nothing!
No gun!

37:01.302 --> 37:04.465
But my friend Officer Parker,
on the other hand, is armed,

37:04.597 --> 37:06.883
and she loves
shootin' bad guys.

37:07.016 --> 37:08.677
- Ez...
- Yeah!

37:08.810 --> 37:11.176
- Underwear too.
We need to get Ezra off balance.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.598
- I'm not doing that!
- What's happening, Ez?

37:13.732 --> 37:15.438
- I don't understand
what he's saying.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.728
I don't understand.
- Here's what you should say.

37:17.861 --> 37:18.941
It's moments like this,

37:19.070 --> 37:21.231
where your life flashes
before your eyes...

37:21.364 --> 37:24.447
- It's funny...
how your...your life just

37:24.576 --> 37:26.441
passes before your eyes
in a moment like this.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.613
- Uh...l don't understand.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.282
I don't understand
what he's doing.

37:29.414 --> 37:30.494
- I never saddled a horse.

37:30.623 --> 37:32.124
- I never learned
to saddle a horse.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.911
- I never ate cottage cheese.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.250
- I never have eaten
cottage cheese.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.461
- I never learned how
to do the electric slide.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.501
- I never learned how to do
the electric slide.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.589
- What's happening, Tobias?
What's happening here?

37:42.719 --> 37:44.425
- I don't know.
- I need a hug.

37:44.554 --> 37:47.637
- I need a hug!
- Hey, get away, you lunatic!

37:47.766 --> 37:50.633
- Look! Eggs!

37:50.769 --> 37:52.634
[shouts]

37:52.771 --> 37:53.635
Don't even think about it.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.103
- Hey, hey!
- Aah!

37:55.231 --> 37:57.938
- Okay, put the gun down!
- Okay. Okay.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.353
- Ah...she was telling him
what to do, man.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.478
Th—that's why
I couldn't read him.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.196
- Good, Ez.
Timely insight.

38:06.868 --> 38:10.702
- Okay, you can put
your clothes back on.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.912
- I'm good, thanks.

38:29.349 --> 38:30.634
- So what happened there?

38:30.767 --> 38:32.098
- He fell.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.218
A lot.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.937
- Rough seas?
- Sounds good to me.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.057
- You get the pump working?
- Oh, yeah.

38:40.193 --> 38:43.310
I'll return it in the morning
soon as I get Gertie patched up.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.568
- Interesting tactics
out there.

38:48.701 --> 38:51.693
Glad to see
you didn't get shot

38:51.830 --> 38:53.991
or beat up or drowned.

38:54.123 --> 38:55.954
- All in a day's work.
- Nathan.

38:56.084 --> 38:58.541
We got work to do.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.463
- Anyone care to tell me
what all this is about?

39:04.592 --> 39:07.129
- Small towns.

39:07.262 --> 39:10.470
Just a local dispute
that had to be handled.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.850
Isn't that right?

39:12.976 --> 39:14.056
- Right.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.972
All over a baseball card,
if you can believe that.

39:18.273 --> 39:21.106
- I look forward
to reading your full report.

39:32.453 --> 39:35.536
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.415
He didn't touch me.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.409
He just told me
what he'd do to you

39:41.546 --> 39:44.162
if I didn't scream
as loud as I could.

39:46.426 --> 39:48.382
- I'm sorry about all this.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.011
- Yeah.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.005
You should be.

40:00.106 --> 40:01.471
- You haven't answered
my question.

40:01.608 --> 40:02.848
- And what question is that?

40:02.984 --> 40:04.724
- Why I should
let you stay in Haven.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.943
- All due respect, sir,
I don't need your permission.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.936
- I've had just about enough
of your insubordin—

40:09.073 --> 40:10.108
- You know what?

40:10.241 --> 40:12.323
This is not about my job
anymore.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.612
This is about me.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.703
It's about who I am
and where I come from.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.036
And those answers
are here in Haven.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.751
They're not in Boston.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.246
They're not in the FBI.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.882
I'm sorry, sir.

40:37.477 --> 40:39.217
I quit.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.623
- Konnichiwa, Katsuno-san.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.663
This is Duke.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.833
Your package is ready
to be picked up.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.298
No.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.212
No trouble at all.

41:14.764 --> 41:19.599
Sure. I can deliver
another one for you.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.389
But unfortunately,
my rates are going up.

41:22.522 --> 41:24.183
You understand.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.727
Mm-hmm.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.476
Domo arigato.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.728
- She's all yours.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.978
Just needed a...push,
like you said.

42:13.114 --> 42:14.229
- Parker's not the type

42:14.365 --> 42:16.606
that likes to be told
what to do.

42:16.743 --> 42:20.076
It's gotta be her idea—
not yours and not mine.

42:21.664 --> 42:24.371
- You sure she deserves all...

42:24.500 --> 42:26.331
this?
- I don't know.

42:26.461 --> 42:28.076
Does anybody?

42:28.212 --> 42:30.168
Tell you what.

42:30.298 --> 42:32.334
We need her here.

42:33.593 --> 42:35.129
- So the crack in the boat?

42:35.261 --> 42:36.922
- Yeah. I saw it.

42:39.599 --> 42:43.012
- You need to get this place
under control.

42:43.144 --> 42:44.384
Soon.
