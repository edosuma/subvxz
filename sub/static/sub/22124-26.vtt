You killed it.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.780

gonna be amazing.

You know, you'’re gonna win one
of those stunt awards for this.

01:26.869 --> 01:28.392
Well, especially after
you get the car chase.

01:28.436 --> 01:29.611
Not sure about that.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.134
What, are you worried about me?

01:31.178 --> 01:33.136
All I got to do is get up
to the top, do that burnout,

01:33.180 --> 01:34.572

I can'’t really talk
about it here,

it'’s a good thing.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.718
Certainly not slumming it
with the humans.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.415
[chuckles]
Wait, have you been

19:59.459 --> 20:00.721
flying around this whole time

20:00.764 --> 20:03.854
like some sort
of feathery homeless man?

20:03.898 --> 20:06.857
[laughing]: Wait, that is
what you'’ve been doing.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.859
What choice do I have?

20:08.903 --> 20:10.774
Since you refuse
to return to Hell,

20:10.818 --> 20:13.081
I can'’t possibly face
our siblings or...

20:13.124 --> 20:14.474
Dad?

20:14.517 --> 20:16.084
Yeah. Quite the judgmental one,

20:16.127 --> 20:17.259
I'’m well aware.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.956
[sighs]
Well...

20:19.000 --> 20:22.177
if your pride won'’t let you back
into the Silver City, Brother,

20:22.221 --> 20:24.701
you should give humans a try.
[grunts]

20:24.745 --> 20:26.137
[chuckles]Oh, come on, Luci,

20:26.181 --> 20:28.009
I'’m the foremost
of God'’s angels.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.490
I can'’t just intermix
with these humans, like...

20:30.533 --> 20:32.448
What, like me?

20:32.492 --> 20:33.493
Yeah, don'’t
worry, Brother.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.059
I mean, they are
absurd creatures,

20:35.103 --> 20:36.626
but sometimes they surprise you.

20:36.670 --> 20:40.326
You should try
talking to one.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.632
See what happens.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.982
Now, if you don'’t mind...

20:50.510 --> 20:53.164
[tires squealing]

20:53.208 --> 20:55.210
Time for a chat, Rexie.[pants]

20:55.254 --> 20:56.994
What the hell happened?
How did you...

20:57.038 --> 20:58.996
Focus! I need
you to tell me,

20:59.040 --> 21:01.303
why did you kill
Stryder Nov...
Let him go!

21:01.347 --> 21:04.175
Huh?
How the hell did you
make it out here anyway?

21:04.219 --> 21:06.743
Look, just give me a moment,
and I'’ll be out of your...

21:06.787 --> 21:07.831
Look, just move.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.051
You'’re not going anywhere, pal.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.271
Look, I just want to talk...

21:15.056 --> 21:16.971
♪

21:22.019 --> 21:24.108
I thought you
just wanted to talk.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.284
Why are you arresting me?
Did you see what
that nutjob did?

21:25.327 --> 21:27.764
How the hell
did he do that, anyway?

21:27.808 --> 21:29.331
I don'’t care about him.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.986
I want to know about
the murder of Stryder Novac.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.075
Stryder... Oh, man. I was
trying not to think about that

21:34.118 --> 21:36.033
and just focus
on the race...
I know he was

21:36.077 --> 21:38.862
gonna replace you and force you
into an early retirement,

21:38.906 --> 21:42.213
so you can knock it off
with the weepy act!

21:42.257 --> 21:43.954
I didn'’t kill him,
if that'’s what you're thinking.

21:43.998 --> 21:45.173
I would never do that.

21:45.216 --> 21:46.957
All right, we can do this
one of three ways.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.046
Let me guess:
the easy way or...

21:49.090 --> 21:50.570
[grunts]
What the hell!

21:50.613 --> 21:54.138
There is no easy way.
We can do this the fast way,

21:54.182 --> 21:55.575
the slow way...

21:55.618 --> 21:59.361
Then, there'’s my
favoriteway![groans]

21:59.405 --> 22:02.886
So, try, maybe, '’cause
there is nothing I love more

22:02.930 --> 22:04.845
than making a grown man cry.

22:04.888 --> 22:06.542
I-I'’ll tell you everything
you want to know.

22:06.586 --> 22:08.152
So that'’s your
favorite way.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.546
I'’ve always wondered
since I saw you give

22:10.590 --> 22:13.375
that speech in Weaponizer 3:
Thou Shalt Not Kill.

22:13.419 --> 22:14.898
I thought that sounded
familiar. What...

22:14.942 --> 22:16.857
Wait a minute,

22:16.900 --> 22:18.032
are you Chloe Decker?

22:18.075 --> 22:19.686
She is.
Amazing, isn'’t it?

22:19.729 --> 22:21.731
What the hell is
going on around here?

22:21.775 --> 22:22.993
He was about to talk.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.865
Well, apologies
for the interruption.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.083
But if you'’ll allow me
to make amends,

22:26.127 --> 22:27.607
I'’ve got a few skills
of my own.

22:27.650 --> 22:30.566
Tell me... Rex...

22:30.610 --> 22:33.395
what is it you desire?

22:37.356 --> 22:39.401
REX:
Wait, I...

22:39.445 --> 22:43.405
want a good story.

22:43.449 --> 22:46.843
Wh-What...What are you
talking about?

22:48.192 --> 22:51.631
Uh, people, they don'’t
follow cars anymore.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.023
They follow drivers.

22:53.067 --> 22:56.070
Drama. Stryder'’s dad,
he was a NASCAR legend.

22:56.113 --> 22:58.420
And your biggest rival,
if I remember correctly.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.683
When he died,
so did my merch sales.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.250
So, getting Stryder
to replace him,

23:02.293 --> 23:03.730
that-that-that got
the rivalry back.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.906
Yeah, but how does that
help you? You'’re out of a job.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.298
I started a management firm

23:07.342 --> 23:08.865
about a year ago--
Stryder was a client.

23:08.909 --> 23:12.129
It was my idea to
get him to replace me.

23:12.173 --> 23:15.829
Poor kid. Stryder,
he... he was so happy

23:15.872 --> 23:17.221
when I made him
that offer.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.702
Well, yeah, it was an
opportunity of a lifetime.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.835
Apparently, he needed the money
to get him out of a jam.

23:21.878 --> 23:24.228
What do you mean, "jam"?

23:24.272 --> 23:26.405
He was having some trouble
with a guy at work.

23:31.671 --> 23:33.281
Uh, uh, excuse me.

23:33.324 --> 23:34.500
What the hell
was that back there?

23:34.543 --> 23:36.197
I'’ve already apologized
for interrupting

23:36.240 --> 23:37.938
your monologue,
Ms. Decker.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.244
No, how the hell did you
get Rex to spill like that?

23:40.288 --> 23:43.117
Ah, well, I have the ability
to draw out people'’s desires.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.248
Well, what are you,
psychic or something?

23:44.292 --> 23:46.903
No, no, I can'’t read
people'’s minds.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.818
I'’m not a Jedi.
[chuckles]

23:48.862 --> 23:50.472
People just like
to tell me things.

23:50.516 --> 23:53.388
Okay, well, we should stop
stepping on each other'’s toes,

23:53.432 --> 23:55.521
because we both clearly
want the same thing.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.958
Oh, that'’s very forward
of you, Ms. Decker.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.699
Yes, I will have sex with you.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.527
We should probably solve
this murder first...No, no.

24:01.570 --> 24:03.093
I mean that we should
work together.

24:03.137 --> 24:05.444
[laughing]:
No.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.271
I mean, you'’ve proven
a very impressive adversary,

24:07.315 --> 24:09.491
but I'’m not really
a "work together" kind of Devil.

24:09.535 --> 24:12.276
So...
Well, too bad.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.583
Because I know who Stryder was
fighting with at work.

24:14.627 --> 24:17.064
Very well...

24:18.935 --> 24:21.460
Lead the way, Ms. Decker.
[chuckles]

24:23.940 --> 24:26.508
So, the second marriage
is going well?

24:26.552 --> 24:28.423
Oh, totally.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.207
Uh, e-even though
I'’ve made mistakes,

24:30.251 --> 24:33.254
the second time around
just feels better. You know?

24:33.297 --> 24:34.255
Mm, yes.

24:34.298 --> 24:36.300
It can be hard
to trust again.

24:36.344 --> 24:37.911
This time I just know
she loves me for me.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.913
I have no doubt...

24:39.956 --> 24:41.567
that you'’ll stay with us.

24:41.610 --> 24:46.746
More with box office sensation
Nathan Fury when we come back.

24:46.789 --> 24:49.444
And cut.[set bell rings]

24:49.488 --> 24:53.927
Wow, Linda, every day I am
in awe watching you work.

24:53.970 --> 24:57.234
Oh... [chuckles]
Thank you, Stacy.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.801
Uh, when we come
back from break,

24:58.845 --> 25:01.108
ask him how he feels about
his new wife cheating on him.

25:01.151 --> 25:04.503
Can you just give us one second,
please? Thank you.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.721
Wait, what?

25:05.765 --> 25:07.636
Our investigator
caught her on tape

25:07.680 --> 25:10.900
kissing her costar
at the Farmer'’s Market.

25:10.944 --> 25:11.945
Juicy, right?

25:11.988 --> 25:13.947
No. My God,
that'’s terrible.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.775
That'’s going to
devastate Nathan.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.298
And make great TV.

25:17.341 --> 25:21.607
As his therapist,
I can'’t in good conscience

25:21.650 --> 25:22.869
incite a breakdown.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.174
That'’s not why I do this.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.481
And that is why America
loves you, Linda.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.309
But you know what else
America loves?

25:28.352 --> 25:29.266
Tears.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.964
But Stacy, you can'’t...

25:31.007 --> 25:32.182
Ratings are down.

25:32.226 --> 25:35.055
We need a boost like this.

25:35.098 --> 25:36.535
What'’s more important
to you?

25:46.675 --> 25:47.981
WOMAN:
Set.

25:48.024 --> 25:50.505
Aah! [grunts]

25:50.549 --> 25:52.507
That'’s who was arguing
with your stuntman?

25:52.551 --> 25:54.378
Lara Croft wannabe?
WOMAN:
What the hell, Rogers?

25:54.422 --> 25:56.337
Erika Dunlap.
My costar.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.034
I told you that move
wouldn'’t work.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.427
Why don'’t you ever
listen to me?

25:59.470 --> 26:01.429
Well, she seems to be fighting
with a lot of people.

26:01.472 --> 26:03.997
Well, her beef with Stryder
was a lot bigger.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.215
LUCIFER:
Oh?

26:05.259 --> 26:06.695
ROGERS: Chloe, what
are you doing here?

26:06.739 --> 26:08.088
You on the schedule today?

26:08.131 --> 26:09.655
Hey, Ben. I just forgot
some things in my trailer.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.657
But what'’s going on
with Erika lately?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.572
I mean, she was giving
Stryder grief, too,

26:13.615 --> 26:14.747
the last time I saw her.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.313
Everyone deals with
death differently.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.098
In Erika'’s case, she
deals by taking it out

26:18.141 --> 26:20.013
on my entire stunt team.Lovely.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.884
Nothing we can'’t handle.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.582
Sorry.
Yeah.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.237
All right, when you'’re finished
having a catch-up...

26:27.281 --> 26:29.283
What?What was the bigger beef?

26:29.326 --> 26:33.156
Uh, well, Erika got
hurt during a stunt

26:33.200 --> 26:34.549
and she was looking forward

26:34.593 --> 26:36.856
to a hefty settlement, but
her eyewitness, Stryder,

26:36.899 --> 26:38.509
refused to testify on her behalf

26:38.553 --> 26:41.687
and it-it didn'’t go over well
with Erika.

26:41.730 --> 26:44.559
Oh, so you think she killed him
out of revenge?

26:44.603 --> 26:46.300
Or knowing that without
an eyewitness,

26:46.343 --> 26:48.041
she'’d have a better chance
at winning the case.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.608
And reap the windfall.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.653
Right. You know,
I'’d go talk to Erika,

26:51.697 --> 26:54.482
but she and I don'’t
exactly see eye-to-eye.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.704
I'’ve seen what you
can do to people.

26:58.747 --> 27:01.663
Erika'’s trailer
is right there.

27:01.707 --> 27:05.580
Why don'’t you go
and, you know,

27:05.624 --> 27:07.060
do your thing?

27:07.103 --> 27:08.757
Ah.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.068
I mean...Monkey?

27:15.111 --> 27:17.897
Dad. Hi. What-what
are you doing here?

27:17.940 --> 27:19.855
Well, I'’ve been hearing
some crazy stories.

27:19.899 --> 27:23.642
You didn'’t sneak into
a NASCAR race, right?

27:23.685 --> 27:26.732
And you definitely didn'’t
impersonate a cop?

27:26.775 --> 27:28.647
Okay, Dad, it'’s not what
you'’re thinking.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.257
Good, '’cause if
you'’re still working

27:30.300 --> 27:32.433
with that mentally ill nightclub
owner, w-what'’s-his-name.

27:32.476 --> 27:34.478
ERIKA [ecstatic]:
Lucifer!

27:34.522 --> 27:36.002
Lucifer!
LUCIFER:
That'’s right,

27:36.045 --> 27:38.744
say my name. Say my name.[Erika moaning in pleasure]

27:43.531 --> 27:45.228
CHARLOTTE:
Lucifer?

27:45.272 --> 27:48.579
Is anyone here?

28:04.552 --> 28:05.771
Lucifer?

28:13.126 --> 28:15.258
[sighs]

28:19.045 --> 28:20.829
Jackpot.

28:42.503 --> 28:45.636
Um, I work for Lucifer.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.638
He sent me here to
get the cash for...

28:47.682 --> 28:49.205
I don'’t care
about the money.

28:49.249 --> 28:50.598
You don'’t?

28:50.641 --> 28:53.732
I care about why you want it.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.693
Tell me the truth
and it'’s yours.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.392
Lucifer needs it

29:02.436 --> 29:04.133
to finish the
Vegas deal.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.308
[sighs]

29:05.352 --> 29:08.268
Because I deserve it.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.233
What would you do with it?

29:17.277 --> 29:20.671
Whatever I damn well want.

29:20.715 --> 29:24.675
I'’ll take that
as a promise.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.464
Go.

29:30.507 --> 29:34.424
Embrace your deepest,
darkest desire.

29:35.817 --> 29:39.560
Let those sinful little embers
burn into a flame.

29:42.302 --> 29:43.607
Why?

29:43.651 --> 29:47.220
We'’ll meet again...
eventually.

29:47.263 --> 29:50.440
Somewhere hotter.

29:50.484 --> 29:52.791
And the more you sin,

29:52.834 --> 29:55.315
the more fun it'’ll be for me.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.927
Think of this as foreplay.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.803
However...

30:04.846 --> 30:10.330
if I ever see you and that
boy toy in Los Angeles again,

30:10.373 --> 30:13.463
I will gut that pretty
belly of yours.

30:13.507 --> 30:18.468
Everyone knows you don'’t
steal from the Devil.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.735
JOHN:
Do you have any idea

30:24.779 --> 30:27.782
what a difficult situation
you'’ve put me in?

30:27.826 --> 30:29.088
Dad, I had to do something.

30:29.131 --> 30:31.090
Okay? Stryder wasn'’t killed
in a bar fight.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.614
And we are on to something.
I can feel it.

30:33.657 --> 30:36.008
"We"?
LUCIFER:
Bye, Erika.

30:36.051 --> 30:38.184
My flexible friend. [laughs]

30:38.227 --> 30:40.012
Well, your plan worked wonders.

30:40.055 --> 30:44.364
Consider the suspect
well and truly pumped.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.844
F-F-For information.

30:45.887 --> 30:48.629
Uh-huh. He means pumped
for information.

30:48.672 --> 30:51.893
What happened to doing
your hypno-eye thing?

30:51.937 --> 30:53.068
With the eyes.
Oh.

30:53.112 --> 30:54.765
[laughs]
That'’s what you meant.
Yes.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.463
Oh, no, we went at it
like little bunnies.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.291
Next time you should be
more specific.

30:58.334 --> 31:00.771
There will be no "next time."

31:00.815 --> 31:03.035
I raised you better
than this, Chloe.

31:03.078 --> 31:04.645
Dad...LUCIFER: Oh.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.777
Papa Decker, I presume?

31:06.821 --> 31:08.997
Right. Well,
from what I'’ve seen,

31:09.041 --> 31:11.913
what you'’ve raised is
an intelligent, capable

31:11.957 --> 31:14.524
and frustratingly
stubborn woman.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.048
Don'’t talk to me
about my daughter.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.919
We'’ll discuss this later.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.878
Now go home.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.401
I...

31:21.444 --> 31:23.359

31:25.013 --> 31:27.886
I don'’t know why, but I actually
thought he'’d be proud of me.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.627
Well, disappointing fathers is
a rite of passage, Ms. Decker.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.412
Take it from someone
who'’s made a living out of it.

31:32.455 --> 31:33.892
No, no, he'’s right.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.458
He'’s right. I'm not a cop.

31:35.502 --> 31:37.025
I'’m an actress.

31:37.069 --> 31:41.160
I mean... who really thought
that I could solve a murder?

31:41.203 --> 31:42.639
Well, I did.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.685
And I still do.

31:44.728 --> 31:47.949
There'’s no evidence,
not of anything.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.255
That'’s not necessarily true,

31:49.298 --> 31:50.778
'’cause I just learned that
that Erika woman

31:50.821 --> 31:52.084
can put her ankles
around my neck.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.913
Okay, that'’s really
not helping right now.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.784
Thank you.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.438
Wait, if she was
really injured,

31:58.481 --> 31:59.613
she wouldn'’t be
able to do that.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.963
Precisely.
She was faking her injury.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.444
[laughs] And she was very
generous with information

32:04.487 --> 32:05.749
after I was very generous
with the ol...

32:05.793 --> 32:07.012
Okay, I don'’t want to know.

32:07.055 --> 32:09.928
Okay. Well, she said
that she needed money

32:09.971 --> 32:13.105
and that Stryder refused
to lie on her behalf.

32:13.148 --> 32:14.758
But then he said he was coming
into a windfall

32:14.802 --> 32:16.195
and could help her out.

32:16.238 --> 32:17.805
Apparently he and a partner
were planning on stealing

32:17.848 --> 32:19.589
something very valuable
from set.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.504
So maybe Stryder was
backing out of this heist

32:21.548 --> 32:22.766
to have a shot at NASCAR.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.072
Well, his partner
wouldn'’t take kindly

32:24.116 --> 32:26.031
to being left high and dry, now,
would he?

32:26.074 --> 32:27.423
No. He wouldn'’t.

32:27.467 --> 32:30.818
So, does that mean
you'’re still in, Detective?

32:30.861 --> 32:34.082
How do we figure out who Stryder
was working with on set?

32:34.126 --> 32:38.217
Perhaps the murder weapon
will help narrow it down.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.958
Come on.

Okay.

was thinking

33:38.929 --> 33:40.844

you brought Bonnie to life,

Thank you, but you do know
by the end of the movie,

Bonnie did join
the police force.

Tell me.

doesn'’t really mean anything.
