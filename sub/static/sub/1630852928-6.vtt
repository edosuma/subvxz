WEBVTT

00:45.879 --> 00:47.130
Yrsa?

01:43.478 --> 01:44.562
Yrsa.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.451
Who did this to you?

02:09.754 --> 02:11.756


02:52.922 --> 02:55.633
So, you must be the one
with a cross on her back.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.556
I was expecting a warrior.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.309
You're just a girl.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.579
Why have you done this?

03:27.957 --> 03:29.792
You killed my Berserker.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.336
He attacked us.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.214
We did nothing but protect ourselves.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.761
You bent the bow of God's wrath.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.347
I am God's arrow.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.768
When you've finished with her,
bring me her body.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.269
I have a message to send.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.312
No!

03:55.401 --> 03:56.319
Stop!

03:58.363 --> 03:59.822
Where did you get that sword?

04:01.824 --> 04:02.909
In Uppsala.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.120
A priest gave it to me.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.164
Uppsala?

04:10.750 --> 04:12.085
Did you see him?

04:13.294 --> 04:14.337
The Old One?

04:17.006 --> 04:18.925
What did he call you?

04:21.636 --> 04:23.888
What did he call you?

04:25.598 --> 04:26.557
The Last.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.694
What is your name, girl?

04:39.529 --> 04:40.530
Freydis.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.783
Take a message to Haakon.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.078
Tell her Jarl Kåre is coming.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.305


05:11.060 --> 05:15.273
May God bless and keep you
until we see each other again, my friend.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.651
You, too, Norí.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.488
I support your decision to stay.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.615
Canute takes care of his faithful.

05:25.199 --> 05:27.577
I do not like this game
that you're playing with him.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.330
It's not a game.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.123
Canute has made his decision.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.876
He wishes to be King of England.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.586
I, Norway.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.504
And when he learns what you've done,

05:39.672 --> 05:41.799
he will return and destroy you,
you know that.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.593
With what?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.179
Half his force is sailing.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.058
And those like you who remain,

05:50.141 --> 05:53.102
will you fight against your homeland
as part of an English army?

05:56.022 --> 05:57.315
I didn't think so.

06:07.867 --> 06:11.662
The head of King Æthelred.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.374
Not what I came here for.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.460
Safe journey, Greenlander.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.386
I won't forget our… agreement.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.517
Are you sure you know
what you're doing here?

06:33.309 --> 06:37.146
Next time we meet,
those coins will bear my face. Hmm?

06:56.707 --> 06:57.625
Pull left.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.137
A great city.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.222
Yes.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.766
I feel pity about the bridge.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.696
Do you approve of your new quarters?

07:26.779 --> 07:28.948
I cannot accept them.
I never asked for that.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.033
As I remember, you requested nothing.

07:32.743 --> 07:36.414
A man who asks for nothing
is someone I cannot trust.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.875
Then allow me to earn that trust.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.461
All right.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.046
Get me a hangman.

07:45.381 --> 07:46.799
Build me a gallows here.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.509
As Your Highness commands.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.305
And do you have
a specific reason for this action?

07:53.181 --> 07:56.392
Eleven reasons. And you know them all.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.318
Up!

08:15.786 --> 08:18.998
A gift. From King Canute.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.170
-What has happened to Edmund?
-He's alive.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.256
Canute intends to rule England with him.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.257
He's staying?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.552
A Viking king?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.012
Yes. A Viking king,

08:33.095 --> 08:35.932
and one who wishes to learn
about his country and to meet his nobles.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.519
Oh, look at you,

08:40.228 --> 08:42.522
kissing the arse of the enemy.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.777
Just like your father.

08:51.405 --> 08:52.281
Leofric.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.159
Why don't you be
the first to meet the king,

08:55.826 --> 08:57.495
tell him about Northumbria?

09:30.903 --> 09:33.573
I've come to offer my thanks
for the return of my sons

09:34.490 --> 09:37.285
and to ask what I can do
to repay your kindness.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.373
I accept your thanks, but…

09:44.458 --> 09:46.460
you are under no obligation to me.

09:47.211 --> 09:51.340
In fact, you are free to go at any time.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.844
Free to go? Where?

09:59.223 --> 10:02.059
Normandy, if you wish.

10:04.729 --> 10:05.813
Home.

10:10.985 --> 10:11.986
King Canute…

10:15.573 --> 10:17.658
I came to England when I was a girl.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.911
This is my home now,
and where I wish to remain.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.460
I am pleased to hear that.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.712
You are?

10:30.588 --> 10:31.464
Why?

10:31.547 --> 10:35.551
Because I would like you
to be my… advisor.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.802
An advisor?

10:38.429 --> 10:40.389
And on what subject would I advise you?

10:40.473 --> 10:44.477
I'm an outsider, as… you once were.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.856
Half my army sailed away this morning,
which makes me vulnerable here.

10:48.939 --> 10:51.776
You convinced the Saxons to accept you.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.445
Now, I need them to accept me.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.031
What do you want from England?

11:07.458 --> 11:10.252
I wish to build a great northern empire

11:12.213 --> 11:13.381
that stretches

11:15.049 --> 11:16.676
across the top of Europe.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.346
You need England's wealth.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.014
Yes.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.571
We were attacked on the road to Uppsala.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.409
A Berserker killed your guards
and one of my friends.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.952
How did you escape?

11:43.953 --> 11:44.829
I killed him.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.414
Did you use your knife

11:47.248 --> 11:49.125
or bring him down with your bare hands?

11:49.208 --> 11:51.210
I strangled him with my bracelet.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.630
With your bracelet!
I'm impressed.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.675
You must join my Shield-maidens.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.010
He served a Christian Jarl named Kåre.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.055
-Did you see Kåre?
-Yes.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.558
He told me to tell you
that he's coming for Kattegat.

12:05.641 --> 12:08.728
Kåre does not have the forces
to threaten Kattegat.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.771
He killed my friends

12:12.064 --> 12:14.108
and slaughtered an entire village.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.693
He is a murderer.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.201
You are tired.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.078
Go and rest.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.539
When you have rested,

12:29.373 --> 12:32.334
I want to hear of your trip
to Uppsala. Hmm?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.927
Increase the patrols.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.347
You cannot possibly believe her.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.515
I do.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.018
And I believe you're right as well.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.270
She should join your Shield-maidens.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.689
Train her.

13:11.874 --> 13:12.875
Kåre!

13:15.628 --> 13:16.712
Come!

13:21.175 --> 13:22.343
Quick, Kåre.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.772
I'm here to prepare.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.086
Even before your invasion,
the kingdoms were suffering.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.299
Every Ealdorman
is facing the threat of rebellion.

15:29.887 --> 15:33.974
I can place new men in power
who can enforce tax collection.

15:34.058 --> 15:37.603
The problem is not the collectors,
it is tax itself.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.063
It is crippling,

15:40.022 --> 15:41.941
which is why I suggest a new one.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.197
A simple levy on every household.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.785
-But this is hardly anything.
-Exactly.

15:52.868 --> 15:56.121
But gathered across the whole of England,
every town, every village,

15:56.205 --> 15:58.165
it is more than enough to build an army,

15:59.083 --> 15:59.959
a fleet,

16:01.669 --> 16:02.795
an empire.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.436
Keep your shield higher!

16:21.855 --> 16:24.108
The battle comes from all sides.

16:37.997 --> 16:42.459
The battle ends, but it's
never over until you don't get up.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.087
Let's go again.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.383
Enough for today.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.685
You have yet to tell me about Uppsala.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.731
I had a vision

17:04.481 --> 17:07.151
and I met a man
the priests called The Seer.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.323
He seemed to be expecting me
and he called me "The Last."

17:15.617 --> 17:19.329
He asked me about what I had seen,
but my answers seemed to disappoint him.

17:20.914 --> 17:23.834
-You know of him?
-I do.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.505
The Seer told me my destiny as well.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.925
Was it confusing?

17:33.093 --> 17:34.386
Mine was simple.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.015
He told me about a wave

17:39.516 --> 17:41.143
that only I could see.

17:44.980 --> 17:48.650
First, the water left the harbor.

17:51.111 --> 17:54.698
<i>The people thought it was a blessing</i>
<i>from the Gods, Syn and Ran.</i>

17:55.365 --> 17:56.825
<i>A gift of the sea.</i>

17:57.659 --> 17:59.745
<i>They celebrated their bounty.</i>

18:01.497 --> 18:04.541
<i>No one asked</i>
<i>where the water had gone. No one cared.</i>

18:06.210 --> 18:07.878
But it had to go somewhere.

18:08.796 --> 18:09.797
When it came back…

18:12.841 --> 18:14.802
it was as tall as the mountains,

18:16.261 --> 18:17.888
and as deep as the Earth.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.608
<i>And there was nothing</i>
<i>I could do to stop it.</i>

18:34.446 --> 18:36.865
In your vision,
does anyone survive?

18:38.784 --> 18:39.785
A woman.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.665
For a long time, I thought it was me.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.961
But I was wrong.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.757
The woman is you.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.929
You are "The Last."

19:00.055 --> 19:02.391
The Last Daughter of Uppsala.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.510
All hail King Canute!

19:39.303 --> 19:41.680
Ruler of Denmark and England!

19:41.763 --> 19:43.557
All hail!

19:45.100 --> 19:48.395
I have chosen to remain here
in England as your king.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.025
As uncomfortable as that thought may be,

19:53.609 --> 19:57.863
I have brought you here
to convince you that this is a good thing.

19:57.946 --> 19:58.947
First,

20:00.282 --> 20:04.411
I plan to restore your lands and titles

20:05.245 --> 20:08.373
and promise no more
Viking raids upon your kingdoms.

20:09.499 --> 20:14.546
Second, I will rebuild the bridge,
better…

20:14.630 --> 20:16.715
…and stronger than before.

20:17.674 --> 20:22.971
Finally, I intend to forge
a great empire of the north

20:23.764 --> 20:28.727
whose shield will bring you peace
and whose wealth we will all enjoy.

20:30.020 --> 20:34.274
I have also decided
to rule alongside Edmund,

20:35.067 --> 20:36.526
your chosen king,

20:38.028 --> 20:39.821
whom I will support.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.741
These are my offerings.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.036
But dependent on one thing…

20:49.414 --> 20:50.332
loyalty.

20:51.041 --> 20:54.086
Now, it is my experience

20:54.169 --> 20:58.590
that loyalty can be obtained in two ways.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.675
One way

21:00.634 --> 21:01.635
is painful.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.763
The other…

21:11.353 --> 21:12.229
Fulfilling.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.731
The choice is yours.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.495
Your Highness. I am Cyneheard,

21:29.454 --> 21:30.872
Ealdorman of Kent.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.336
I pledge my loyalty to you.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.380
I give you my oath.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.008
Ah, yes, Cyneheard.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.051
I met your wife.

21:44.928 --> 21:48.015
Rise and return to your shire

21:49.099 --> 21:50.267
and your wife.

21:51.893 --> 21:52.978
If she will take you.

21:58.025 --> 22:02.070
Your Highness, Wulfhere,
Ealdorman of Sussex.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.991
Your Highness. I too, pledge my loyalty.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.833
Ealdorman Oswick of East Anglia.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.731
Good.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.527
The fleet is returning.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.500
Leif!

24:22.043 --> 24:23.336
Leif!

24:26.173 --> 24:27.257
You're alive!

24:29.342 --> 24:30.427
You're alive!

24:37.225 --> 24:38.643
What is this?

24:38.727 --> 24:40.770
There's much to tell you.

24:42.355 --> 24:43.231
Njal?

24:45.859 --> 24:46.693
Skarde?

24:51.281 --> 24:52.324
And Ulf.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.204
Then Yrsa and Toke
are not alone in Valhalla.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.750
Oh.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.262
It's just us now.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.601
Come, you must be tired from your journey.

25:44.167 --> 25:47.337
A gift from the new King of England.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.426
And me.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.345
King Canute intends to stay?

25:55.428 --> 25:56.471
He does.

25:57.055 --> 26:00.642
And he promises to make me
the next King of Norway.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.602
And what is expected of me?

26:03.186 --> 26:08.567
You are an example for us all.
Leader of a powerful, open kingdom.

26:10.485 --> 26:14.489
Jarl Haakon, I need your support.

26:24.165 --> 26:26.543
And what about your brother?

26:28.628 --> 26:31.965
Jarl Olaf does not have
the blessing of King Canute.

26:32.549 --> 26:33.675
Does he know that?

26:34.384 --> 26:35.802
Not my problem.

26:35.885 --> 26:37.929
But it is a problem.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.170
Queen Aelfgifu.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.715
I'm returning home from England.

27:13.798 --> 27:17.177
I beg your permission
for my fleet to resupply in your harbor

27:17.260 --> 27:19.220
before continuing our journey.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.473
Jarl Olaf, you're welcome.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.684
What news have you of my husband?

27:25.769 --> 27:27.562
He is alive and well, Your Highness,

27:27.646 --> 27:30.357
and successful in his conquest of England.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.276
Praise God. And when will he return?

27:34.361 --> 27:35.987
That I do not know.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.282
When I left,
his intention was to remain in England.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.409
Remain?

27:43.536 --> 27:46.081
Forgive me, Your Highness,

27:46.164 --> 27:49.000
I thought he had told you his plan.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.215
Come with me.

28:08.812 --> 28:09.771
Why?

28:10.355 --> 28:13.233
He has assumed the crown of England.

28:13.316 --> 28:14.776
Which means I am Queen.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.447
And a wonderful queen you would be.

28:20.740 --> 28:23.535
What is it that you're not telling me?

28:24.160 --> 28:26.121
England already has a queen.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.956
King Æthelred's widow.

28:32.752 --> 28:33.962
She is very beautiful

28:34.921 --> 28:39.217
and, uh, has become close to your husband.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.928
Very close.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.807
Before I left, there was even
rumors of marriage.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.435
A shame too.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.812
She's a Norman.

28:53.648 --> 28:55.775
And you are a Mercian,

28:57.777 --> 29:00.864
the least secure of the English shires.

29:03.241 --> 29:07.245
Why have you really
come to Jelling, Olaf Haraldsson?

29:07.954 --> 29:09.539
Other than to torment me.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.676
I wish to rule Norway.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.138
Canute will not permit this.

29:25.221 --> 29:28.683
He will call upon his fleet
to join him in challenging me.

29:29.392 --> 29:33.062
I need you to deny him that fleet.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.523
I do not have that power.

29:36.691 --> 29:37.859
On the contrary,

29:38.860 --> 29:41.154
you possess more power than you think.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.157
You just have to know how to use it.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.082
Jarl Haakon sent us to Uppsala.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.501
To Uppsala?

29:54.584 --> 29:56.878
Is it like in the stories
we heard growing up?

29:58.296 --> 29:59.547
It's better.

29:59.631 --> 30:03.051
Temples as high as the sky
with golden rooftops

30:03.635 --> 30:05.345
and hundreds of the faithful.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.306
But it is threatened by Christians.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.310
So, this is your new mission.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.272
What I have seen has changed me.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.442
I cannot leave Kattegat now,

30:21.027 --> 30:22.529
and I hope you will stay too.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.409
-We stay.
-That makes me so happy.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.413
-It's so good to have you here with me.
-Oh, and you with us.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.209
We should check on the boats.

30:48.471 --> 30:49.764
Look at you.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.600
You're no longer a hunter.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.852
You're a warrior.

30:57.772 --> 30:58.982
Much has changed.

31:00.316 --> 31:01.317
Tell me.

31:03.319 --> 31:06.573
My friends were killed
by a Christian Jarl named Kåre.

31:08.783 --> 31:10.034
I've heard of him.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.912
He's a zealot and a crazy man, Freydis.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.958
If he killed innocents,
he must be punished.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.337
He will be.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.094
Not every Christian is bad, Freydis.

31:28.803 --> 31:31.055
All religions have flaws. Yours and mine.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.393
If they are both so flawed,

31:36.394 --> 31:38.229
why don't we stay with our own Gods?

31:38.938 --> 31:40.440
My grandfather converted

31:40.523 --> 31:43.902
so he could pass the crown
through our family without bloodshed.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.653
That's not a belief in anything.

31:46.988 --> 31:50.074
What about all of us
that will never be king?

31:51.284 --> 31:52.619
Where does that leaves us?

31:57.248 --> 31:58.166
I thought so.

32:21.189 --> 32:24.859
Hail Prince Harald and Leif Eriksson,

32:25.485 --> 32:28.613
the heroes of London!

32:30.573 --> 32:35.411
West over water they fared
to tear the English crown

32:35.495 --> 32:37.789
-from the head of Æthelred.

32:38.915 --> 32:42.585
Or was it the head from the crown?

32:43.836 --> 32:46.839
By the man
that brought London bridge down!

32:48.007 --> 32:49.467
Guilty!

32:49.550 --> 32:54.305
And this Prince of Greenland,
across oceans he went,

32:54.973 --> 32:57.934
to face hundreds of men
in the village of Kent!

32:58.017 --> 33:01.354
-Hundreds? More like thousands.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.731
Get your story right, Skalde.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.777
I think you better get up
and tell it then.

33:07.860 --> 33:09.487
Up! Up! Up!

33:09.570 --> 33:11.656
Up! Up! Up! Up!

33:15.576 --> 33:17.578
Harald! Harald!

33:17.662 --> 33:19.872
Harald! Harald!

33:26.754 --> 33:27.755
No!

33:28.756 --> 33:32.218
The story I want to tell is not of me.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.596
It belongs to a group of friends.

33:37.056 --> 33:38.349
The Greenlanders.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.644
Leif Eriksson.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.397
My friend.

33:46.691 --> 33:47.775
My brother.

33:48.693 --> 33:52.030
Captain through the storms
of wind and mutiny.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.614
Yeah.

33:53.698 --> 33:57.535
He settled rough waters
and made the passage calm.

33:58.745 --> 33:59.746
Brother.

34:00.955 --> 34:06.586
And Liv, who left her blood in the river
along with the bridge!

34:06.669 --> 34:08.337
Yeah!

34:08.421 --> 34:09.797
This is her story too.

34:11.299 --> 34:15.636
As it is Ulf's, Njal's and Skarde's.

34:17.930 --> 34:21.434
Greenlanders who came
to pay a debt for one,

34:22.393 --> 34:24.854
but stayed to save us all.

34:26.522 --> 34:30.151
They met Syn in Odin's Great Hall,

34:31.027 --> 34:33.362
and she welcomed them into Valhalla.

34:33.446 --> 34:34.781
Yes!

34:35.948 --> 34:37.825
They are
the true heroes of London.

34:38.451 --> 34:42.455
-They are who we celebrate tonight.
-Yes!

34:42.538 --> 34:43.998
For without the Greenlanders,

34:44.832 --> 34:46.918
London Bridge would still be standing,

34:48.252 --> 34:49.462
but we would not.

34:52.006 --> 34:56.094
-The Greenlanders.
-The Greenlanders!

34:56.719 --> 34:57.762
Skol!

34:58.346 --> 34:59.972
Skol!

35:35.842 --> 35:37.385
Thank you for what you said.

35:39.095 --> 35:40.429
I spoke the truth.

35:41.764 --> 35:42.890
With great honor.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.898
Thank you for this.

35:52.358 --> 35:53.818
It brought me luck.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.575
But you should have it back.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.996
Hopefully it brings you fortune
during your test tomorrow.

36:15.464 --> 36:17.758
When are you leaving, Greenlander?

36:17.842 --> 36:19.302
What are my plans to you?

36:19.385 --> 36:20.845
You are not wanted here.

36:20.928 --> 36:24.682
My family has heard how you
killed my father to save a Christian.

36:26.058 --> 36:28.394
Did you tell them
how he murdered one of my crew?

36:29.061 --> 36:30.813
They should know the whole truth.

36:30.897 --> 36:33.482
Before you ask them to do
what you are afraid to.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.464
He's no hero!

36:57.506 --> 37:01.969
He's a Christian lover
and probably a Christian himself!

37:03.054 --> 37:05.014
Leave before I banish you.

37:21.572 --> 37:23.532
His Highness is expecting me.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.534
No one is to enter. Order of the king.

37:26.118 --> 37:27.411
This is important.

37:28.162 --> 37:29.622
He's with Queen Emma.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.333
Alone?

38:23.009 --> 38:24.427
Contemplating an exit?

38:26.137 --> 38:27.430
No, Your Highness.

38:29.056 --> 38:31.434
Just contemplating
how quickly power shifts.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.694
At least you have relevance in this court.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.029
And you do not?

38:43.988 --> 38:45.239
I'm a cipher.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.659
A stranger in my own country.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.454
You are the hereditary King of England.

38:51.537 --> 38:53.164
Voted to power by its nobles.

38:53.247 --> 38:55.875
Who have sworn their allegiance to Canute.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.376
With no army to support him,

38:57.918 --> 39:00.629
he is dependent upon you
to maintain their loyalty.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.635
This is our lot, Your Highness.

39:08.304 --> 39:09.638
At least for a while.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.225
Are you suggesting something?

39:14.894 --> 39:16.145
I'm suggesting nothing.

39:18.981 --> 39:20.149
And neither should you.

40:22.002 --> 40:22.962
Yes!

41:31.739 --> 41:33.032
Get up!

41:33.115 --> 41:34.492
Get up, Freydis!

41:36.577 --> 41:38.078
Come on! Get up!

41:58.307 --> 41:59.350
Continue.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.580
Drop it! Drop it!

42:36.178 --> 42:37.263
Yes.

42:52.319 --> 42:53.612
Well done.

42:53.696 --> 42:55.489
Well fought. You won.

43:10.212 --> 43:12.298
Freydis Eriksdotter.

43:13.382 --> 43:15.467
What promise do you make?

43:16.176 --> 43:20.598
I promise on Odin
to protect Kattegat to the death.

43:26.979 --> 43:29.398
The body and Earth

43:30.941 --> 43:31.900
are one.

43:33.569 --> 43:34.903
As you protect me,

43:35.738 --> 43:37.323
so I you.

43:39.366 --> 43:40.200
Rise.

43:54.506 --> 43:57.301
-Yeah!

44:01.263 --> 44:02.806
Yes!

44:10.439 --> 44:13.025
Yes!

44:23.118 --> 44:24.828
-You succeeded.
-Congratulations.

44:24.912 --> 44:25.871
Thank you.

44:33.170 --> 44:34.797
I, uh, wanted to thank you.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.257
For what?

44:38.425 --> 44:39.301
This.

44:41.387 --> 44:42.805
But I should give it back.

44:44.306 --> 44:45.182
Why?

44:47.059 --> 44:48.560
It brought you luck once.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.272
You might need it tonight,

44:53.148 --> 44:55.025
if you're asking me back to your bed.

45:02.616 --> 45:04.368
You need a hot bath first.

47:28.887 --> 47:31.014
What do you run from, boy?

47:31.098 --> 47:33.851
My brother. They killed him.

47:35.185 --> 47:36.103
Oh.

47:57.332 --> 47:59.668
The same frightened boy.

47:59.751 --> 48:00.794
No.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.255
Not frightened.

48:04.298 --> 48:07.759
Empowered… by the one true God.

48:08.427 --> 48:10.262
But here nonetheless.

48:13.056 --> 48:15.475
"As the sword is carried by the cross."

48:16.310 --> 48:17.519
"Much blood."

48:18.812 --> 48:21.440
"Pouring like fountains."

48:21.523 --> 48:22.816
You remember.

48:23.775 --> 48:27.946
Now you want to know, is it your cross
who holds the sword or hers?

48:29.406 --> 48:36.288
Even Christians can't resist picking
my bones for a glimpse of their destiny.

48:59.978 --> 49:04.316
Now, are you sure you want the truth?

49:23.001 --> 49:25.545
"Never before had there been
a king like Josiah,

49:26.213 --> 49:29.299
who turned to God
with all his heart and soul."

49:33.595 --> 49:35.764
"In the name of Christ our Lord,

49:35.847 --> 49:40.060
he slayed the priests
of the Pagan shrines on their own altars."

49:43.689 --> 49:45.148
"Because cursed is he

49:45.774 --> 49:49.778
who keeps his sword from bloodshed
in the name of God."

49:52.948 --> 49:53.824
"Amen."

50:32.112 --> 50:33.405
I'm sorry, Canute.

50:34.281 --> 50:36.074
A boat just arrived from Denmark.

51:05.228 --> 51:09.691
Summon a priest
and prepare my ship for departure.

51:28.710 --> 51:29.669
What is it?

51:32.881 --> 51:34.257
I must ask you a question.

51:35.759 --> 51:36.760
Please…

51:39.096 --> 51:40.263
answer carefully.
