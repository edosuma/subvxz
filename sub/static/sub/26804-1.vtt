00:31.694 --> 00:32.756
Five years ago,

00:33.299 --> 00:36.018
we were all very
excited about Mars.

00:39.036 --> 00:41.252
Scientists had
proved the existence

00:41.390 --> 00:43.151
of liquid water on its surface.

00:46.385 --> 00:47.400
A year later,

00:47.960 --> 00:50.787
we were all even more
excited by the news

00:51.011 --> 00:53.308
that the Martian
atmosphere was warming.

00:54.666 --> 00:57.509
Everybody was
talking about Mars.

01:00.778 --> 01:03.175
And then, nothing.

01:05.084 --> 01:07.459
The rapidly strengthening
magnetic fields

01:07.705 --> 01:08.912
created a dead zone.

01:09.154 --> 01:11.279
There were no signals
from our satellites,

01:11.426 --> 01:13.113
no transmissions
from our rovers.

01:14.685 --> 01:15.700
Nothing.

01:17.408 --> 01:18.408
So...

01:19.526 --> 01:21.127
in twelve month's time,

01:22.417 --> 01:23.956
Macmillan Enterprises

01:24.094 --> 01:27.446
will be launching
'Initiative One'.

01:28.342 --> 01:31.365
Twenty-five, incredible pioneers

01:31.896 --> 01:35.043
will journey to
humanity's new frontier.

01:36.369 --> 01:37.369
Twelve women.

01:38.510 --> 01:39.510
Twelve men.

01:40.594 --> 01:41.977
And here's the interesting bit.

01:43.642 --> 01:45.446
'Seat 25',

01:46.223 --> 01:49.912
the one-way ticket to a
new life, on a new world.

01:51.813 --> 01:54.652
One of you wonderful people

01:56.685 --> 01:59.472
will be the winner of 'Seat 25'.

02:01.386 --> 02:03.625
If you think you
deserve this chance,

02:04.949 --> 02:06.034
then contact me,

02:07.056 --> 02:08.419
let me know why.

02:10.127 --> 02:12.463
And to all of you who
choose to apply,

02:13.536 --> 02:14.536
I say...

02:16.058 --> 02:18.984
the very best of luck.

03:26.445 --> 03:27.445
This is Faye,

03:27.933 --> 03:28.957
or, Faye Banks.

03:29.996 --> 03:31.012
This is her life,

03:31.388 --> 03:33.671
or at least, her life so far.

03:34.936 --> 03:37.338
Faye remembers, she didn't
always feel like this,

03:38.199 --> 03:40.262
but what 'this' is and
how she used to feel,

03:40.501 --> 03:42.315
she isn't quite sure anymore.

03:43.715 --> 03:45.954
This is Jim, Faye's husband.

03:46.784 --> 03:48.416
Jim tries very hard,

03:49.098 --> 03:51.676
carefully planning the route
his life is going to take,

03:52.486 --> 03:55.671
comfortable with the truth that
hard work will be rewarded.

03:58.662 --> 04:00.115
Jim wasn't always like this,

04:01.012 --> 04:02.401
he used to be very different.

04:08.771 --> 04:11.444
Faye and Jim moved into
this house three years ago,

04:12.059 --> 04:14.342
but until quite recently,
she didn't notice

04:14.620 --> 04:17.615
how the magnolia walls,
meet their cream curtains,

04:17.921 --> 04:19.362
against their pale rug,

04:19.797 --> 04:21.785
in what is now thier beige life.

04:26.108 --> 04:28.556
And every morning, while waiting
for her coffee to brew,

04:29.033 --> 04:30.956
dreaming of Terracotta Red,

04:31.305 --> 04:33.805
Azure Blue and Emerald Green,

04:34.307 --> 04:36.452
Faye finds herself drawn
into the colourful

04:36.464 --> 04:38.620
world created by next
door neighbour, Peter,

04:38.859 --> 04:40.637
and his little
daughter, Flossie.

04:41.990 --> 04:46.232
The small child seemed to Faye,
a supernova of blazing colours

04:46.961 --> 04:49.898
and Peter was the star at
the centre of her universe.

04:51.219 --> 04:54.862
Peter and Flossie spend their mornings
exploring the Amazon Rainforest,

04:55.604 --> 04:58.181
lunchtimes picnicking on
the Galapagos Islands,

04:58.996 --> 05:02.626
and afteroons deep sea diving
on the Great Barrier Reef.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.073
Having given up smoking
some time ago,

05:11.482 --> 05:15.460
Peter is finding it increasingly difficult
to hide his habit from his wife.

05:16.890 --> 05:18.656
I cannot believe you!

05:19.424 --> 05:21.806
Peter, you absolute scumbag!

06:05.859 --> 06:08.343
June is the manager of
the local leisure centre

06:08.852 --> 06:10.993
and since employing
Adrian six months ago,

06:11.559 --> 06:13.530
has found an increasing
number of problems,

06:13.940 --> 06:16.846
for which she needs Adrian's
personal assistance.

06:21.639 --> 06:23.935
As her eyes trace the
shape of his body,

06:24.735 --> 06:27.516
she experiences the feelings
of lust and desire,

06:28.080 --> 06:31.085
that have been missing
from her life for so long.

06:34.689 --> 06:36.745
Every morning, at eleven
minutes past eight,

06:37.112 --> 06:40.032
Faye passes her work
colleague, Teodor Popescu.

06:40.886 --> 06:42.550
Having politely refused
a lift to work,

06:43.015 --> 06:46.312
Faye and Teodor are now left with, what
seems like, their only remaining option,

06:46.659 --> 06:48.769
a slightly awkward wave hello.

06:50.169 --> 06:52.588
As he stands, willing
his bus never to arrive

06:52.968 --> 06:54.335
and his day never to begin,

06:54.772 --> 06:58.132
his thoughts inevitably fall to the
utter pointlessness of it all.

06:59.898 --> 07:00.906
Faye's journey to work

07:01.096 --> 07:04.661
affords her an average of seventeen
minutes, twice a day, which she fills

07:05.049 --> 07:07.619
wondering at the life
of total strangers.

07:27.793 --> 07:29.728
At around the same
time, every day,

07:30.403 --> 07:32.505
Faye's father Terry, and
his new wife Maggie,

07:32.958 --> 07:35.302
take coffee and the
newspapers on their patio.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.978
Having spent years, striving to
bring a taste of the Mediterranean

07:40.097 --> 07:41.640
to the South East of England,

07:41.929 --> 07:43.780
Terry and Maggie have
taken early retirement,

07:44.138 --> 07:46.669
to start a new life
on the Costa del Sol.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.795
Faye's sister, Pandora,
recently returned from Kenya,

07:53.990 --> 07:56.826
where she might have been found
feeding starving children,

07:58.224 --> 07:59.631
or building and orphanage.

08:03.330 --> 08:06.408
Adventurer, explorer and
eternal backpacker,

08:06.772 --> 08:10.022
Pandora is back home and
enjoying a well earned rest.

08:12.160 --> 08:15.671
Faye works in the Human Resources
Department at the local council.

08:16.224 --> 08:17.630
She was recently promoted,

08:18.067 --> 08:20.477
and is now in charge of
Performance Assessment

08:20.771 --> 08:22.279
and Efficiency Layoffs.

08:23.121 --> 08:25.582
So, I'm taking a big
punt on you here.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.816
It's more money,
more responibility.

08:29.456 --> 08:30.456
Are you in?

08:36.336 --> 08:38.461
Yes, OK. Fine.

08:47.824 --> 08:50.652
As I'm sure you're aware, we're
under increasing pressure

08:50.816 --> 08:52.980
to find savings
within the council.

08:53.805 --> 08:57.683
By streamlining the department, we
plan to build on your hard work.

09:00.572 --> 09:03.467
We want you to see
this as an opportunity

09:03.823 --> 09:05.511
rather than a setback.

09:12.168 --> 09:14.002
Although Faye has come
to terms with the fact

09:14.026 --> 09:16.068
she has little in common
with her colleagues,

09:16.592 --> 09:19.732
she still finds herself waiting
that extra five minutes,

09:20.100 --> 09:22.455
in order to avoid the
morning coffee rush.

09:25.151 --> 09:28.518
As Faye took in the solitary
figure of her colleague, Teodor,

09:29.328 --> 09:32.437
it occurred to her, she might
not be entirely alone.

09:35.021 --> 09:36.849
It is well known amongst
the office clique,

09:37.159 --> 09:39.510
that Teodor Popescu
is a pervert.

09:40.307 --> 09:43.904
Since daring to try and dance with Sonia
at the Christmas party last year,

09:44.446 --> 09:47.881
his fate within this tight-knit
pack of employees has been decided.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.264
What isn't well known,

09:51.811 --> 09:55.778
is that for the past year, Riley has taken
secret shots of his female colleagues

09:56.097 --> 09:58.941
and posted them anonymously
online, under the pseudonym,

09:59.408 --> 10:00.612
Stalker Steve.

10:05.850 --> 10:08.577
Having never been invited to
eat lunch with her colleagues,

10:09.196 --> 10:11.868
Faye eats on the same
park bench every day.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.117
Looking down at her application,

10:16.905 --> 10:19.662
a familiar feeling came
bubbling up through her chest.

10:20.861 --> 10:23.345
A feeling she'd tried to
ignore for some time now.

10:25.154 --> 10:26.928
A feeling that, really,

10:28.055 --> 10:29.570
there ought to be
more than this.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.603
This is the life Faye
has weaved for herself.

10:37.746 --> 10:40.746
One tiny web, lost amongst
billions of other tiny webs,

10:41.096 --> 10:43.088
all covering a vast planet.

10:44.227 --> 10:47.446
And most of the time it's the
biggest spider who catches the fly.

10:49.111 --> 10:50.768
But every now and then,

10:51.587 --> 10:54.860
fate gives a chance
to one, lucky soul.

11:28.025 --> 11:29.831
- Faye Banks?
- Yes?

11:30.117 --> 11:31.601
It's Mike Macmillan here.

11:32.257 --> 11:34.523
I'm just calling to
say congratulations.

11:34.705 --> 11:35.752
How are you feeling?

11:36.137 --> 11:38.637
- Erm.
- Pretty overwhelmed, I'm sure.

11:38.814 --> 11:42.431
Well listen, don't worry about anything.
Just let it all sink in

11:42.686 --> 11:45.573
and someone will be over to
see you in the next few days.

11:46.902 --> 11:47.949
You did it Faye.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.562
I'll see you soon.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.080
Faye, you're going to be late.

12:03.775 --> 12:05.181
Right, I'll see you later, OK?

12:21.547 --> 12:24.344
Photocopier's broken so we have
to use the one in Block B.

12:26.844 --> 12:29.578
Just so you know, Sonia's putting
in a formal complaint about

12:29.680 --> 12:32.805
old Teodor Popescu and the
Christmas party incident.

12:33.389 --> 12:36.686
Lucy and Pauline have both had
enough of his attitude as well

12:36.710 --> 12:38.620
so we're putting our foot down.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.990
Got a meeting with Anderson this
afternoon if you want to pop in?

14:12.807 --> 14:14.283
What are you doing
standing there?

14:16.113 --> 14:17.442
You're not ready yet.

14:17.725 --> 14:20.240
You know we're going round to
your parent's to help them pack.

14:21.706 --> 14:22.706
Jim.

14:23.127 --> 14:24.705
I've got something to tell you.

14:30.991 --> 14:32.616
Oh bloody hell Faye.

14:41.347 --> 14:43.901
That was 'De La Rose'
with Lay me Down.

14:45.004 --> 14:46.970
Now, with the winner of Seat 25

14:46.994 --> 14:48.678
due to be announced any day now,

14:48.997 --> 14:50.357
today's phone in is.

14:50.495 --> 14:55.010
'Oceans on Mars: Science
Fiction or Science Fact'.

14:55.373 --> 14:57.736
Well the scientists
have been divided...

15:10.423 --> 15:11.517
You OK Faye?

15:12.238 --> 15:15.215
Yeah, just work stuff.
Had some layoffs today.

15:17.534 --> 15:18.901
It's not just that
though, is it?

15:21.139 --> 15:22.561
I know what you're thinking

15:23.418 --> 15:25.086
and I don't want you
to worry about it.

15:27.595 --> 15:29.384
I think we should start
trying for a baby.

15:34.045 --> 15:35.873
I wish you'd talk to
me about these things.

15:36.678 --> 15:38.506
I've been thinking
about it for a while.

15:39.629 --> 15:42.675
It's the next logical step.

15:43.424 --> 15:44.603
It's what we've been missing.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.086
You feeling better now?

15:47.443 --> 15:48.443
Mmm.

16:03.358 --> 16:04.607
- You OK?
- Yeah.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.136
- Are you sure?
- Yes -OK.

16:07.650 --> 16:11.025
So, I'd say I've probably
seen half the world by now,

16:11.666 --> 16:13.885
but I think it's my
emotional centre

16:13.909 --> 16:15.896
that's really grown
on this last trip.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.054
I mean, actually being
able to reach out

16:19.078 --> 16:20.939
and touch a starving person.

16:21.410 --> 16:24.113
You can't get that kind of perspective
unless you've really lived.

16:24.137 --> 16:26.293
Well, we'd love to see the
pictures, wouldn't we Jim?

16:26.496 --> 16:28.722
I've got, like, hundreds on my Mac.
I'll show you later.

16:30.826 --> 16:34.266
Maggie! Tell them to be
careful with those boxes!

16:34.290 --> 16:36.826
I mean, I wasn't actually
going to take a camera.

16:36.850 --> 16:38.967
I hate the idea of living
life through a lens, but...

16:41.191 --> 16:44.793
Would you mind being a bit
more careful with these boxes?

16:44.924 --> 16:46.986
They are full of very
expensive things.

16:47.153 --> 16:48.200
Sorry.

16:48.647 --> 16:51.491
Has Pandora been telling you
all about her trip to Africa?

16:51.669 --> 16:53.497
Isn't she wonderful.

16:53.991 --> 16:56.827
I did worry about her
catching 'Embola' though.

16:57.773 --> 16:59.788
You wouldn't catch me
sleeping in a mud hut.

16:59.911 --> 17:01.677
That's why you're
perfect for Faye.

17:03.086 --> 17:06.961
Fenton! Jesus Christ! Fenton!

17:12.856 --> 17:14.214
Fenton!

17:16.400 --> 17:19.900
So, er, who was Fenton?

17:20.174 --> 17:23.135
Oh Dad, you're such an idiot.

17:31.823 --> 17:34.417
Oooh! Oh, Jim!

17:34.839 --> 17:37.315
Terry, listen to this! Oh!

17:44.394 --> 17:46.683
Oh! You're going to have a baby?

17:46.849 --> 17:48.483
- Yep.
- Terry, they're finally

17:48.495 --> 17:50.141
going to try for a baby.

17:50.165 --> 17:52.314
Well done my son.

17:52.576 --> 17:54.701
- About time.
- Thank you, thank you.

17:56.723 --> 17:57.840
Thanks Faye.

17:58.138 --> 17:59.390
Wait for your Dad to emigrate,

17:59.414 --> 18:01.594
then you finally decide
to give him a grandchild.

18:03.066 --> 18:05.035
We're going to be grandparents!

18:05.242 --> 18:06.648
She's not even pregnant.

18:06.793 --> 18:08.004
Let's have a drink.

18:08.028 --> 18:09.375
Faye, put on a pot.

18:09.399 --> 18:11.751
A pot? I want to celebrate.

18:12.755 --> 18:13.779
Look in that box Pan.

18:20.048 --> 18:22.795
Give us your mugs,
glasses are packed.

18:23.607 --> 18:25.849
Bloody hell Pan, not that one.

18:28.877 --> 18:30.135
And none for Faye,

18:30.252 --> 18:31.822
she's trying for a baby.

18:34.723 --> 18:37.848
The search for the winner
of Seat 25 is over.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.759
Macmillan Enterprises confirmed
today that the applicant,

18:41.908 --> 18:44.728
chosen from over 700,000
hopefuls, has been informed,

18:45.122 --> 18:48.171
although their identity is being
kept private for the time being.

18:51.843 --> 18:54.491
With limited information on the
state of the developing atmosphere,

18:54.914 --> 18:58.117
nobody knows if the explorers will
be faced with lakes and seas,

18:58.767 --> 18:59.791
or barren desert.

19:31.976 --> 19:33.443
As I'm sure you are aware,

19:33.467 --> 19:35.087
we are under increasing pressure

19:35.111 --> 19:37.456
to find savings
within the council.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.758
This department has been under
review for the last few months

19:43.305 --> 19:45.861
looking to increase our
efficiency within...

19:50.095 --> 19:51.947
I'm so sorry Teodor.

19:52.686 --> 19:56.506
There have been complaints
made by certain people here.

19:58.401 --> 19:59.948
There was a meeting.

20:01.465 --> 20:02.465
I know.

20:05.503 --> 20:07.324
You could dispute this.

20:08.082 --> 20:09.410
I could help you.

20:10.183 --> 20:11.334
Why would I do that?

20:13.038 --> 20:14.820
I know what people
here think of me.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.850
I've had a stable
job for ten years.

20:21.879 --> 20:22.902
I'm lucky.

20:28.729 --> 20:31.721
I'm sorry Teodor, but you've
got till the end of the day.

22:25.519 --> 22:27.097
Are you going to be OK?

22:27.928 --> 22:28.928
Of course.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.710
Are you worried about anything?

22:34.924 --> 22:35.955
No.

22:42.532 --> 22:43.602
Thank you for the lift.

22:47.523 --> 22:49.182
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:43.603 --> 23:46.811
Faye, Chinese is here.

23:47.411 --> 23:48.411
Coming.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.237
Previously on 'In Cold Blood'...

23:56.261 --> 23:57.847
Good timing Mr Chinaman.

24:16.461 --> 24:17.469
How was your Dad?

24:18.162 --> 24:19.201
Hey, what's wrong?

24:20.156 --> 24:22.434
I just can't stand it, I'm
not going home anymore.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.458
What's happened? Is
it your Dad again?

24:25.208 --> 24:28.253
Ever since Mum died, it's like
he can't look at me anymore.

24:29.529 --> 24:31.571
It's like I don't have
a family anymore.

24:32.910 --> 24:34.879
But I'm your family.

24:39.285 --> 24:41.395
We're two halves of
the same person.

24:42.291 --> 24:43.658
You cheesy...

25:10.206 --> 25:11.472
Hands off my ladies.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.381
I would ruin that.

28:31.382 --> 28:32.390
Hello?

28:33.431 --> 28:34.431
Hello.

28:35.310 --> 28:36.310
Are you OK?

28:36.713 --> 28:37.728
Yeah.

28:39.188 --> 28:40.212
I'm Peter.

28:41.336 --> 28:44.070
Hi. I - I'm Faye.

28:45.872 --> 28:46.887
What are you doing?

28:48.002 --> 28:49.424
I'm looking at Mars.

28:50.253 --> 28:51.417
You can see it from here?

28:52.452 --> 28:53.718
I've got a telescope.

28:53.872 --> 28:56.044
Oh! How does it look?

28:57.235 --> 28:58.235
Mars?

28:58.572 --> 29:00.736
Yeah. Don't say it's red.

29:05.048 --> 29:06.736
It's... It's beautiful.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.242
It's small.

29:10.731 --> 29:12.753
But it's the only planet
in our solar system

29:12.777 --> 29:15.984
who's surface features you can
really see through a telescope.

29:16.594 --> 29:19.227
It's pretty blurry
most of the time but

29:20.214 --> 29:21.792
if you wait long enough,

29:23.402 --> 29:26.058
the thermal currents in our
Earth's atmosphere clear

29:26.613 --> 29:28.574
for just a few seconds

29:30.807 --> 29:32.420
and it's breathtaking.

29:33.255 --> 29:36.303
You can see shadows

29:36.327 --> 29:38.030
and the black canals.

29:38.717 --> 29:40.654
You used to be able
to see the polar caps

29:40.678 --> 29:42.123
but they've gone of course.

29:42.685 --> 29:43.685
Wow.

29:44.747 --> 29:47.197
I've never heard anyone
describe it like that before.

29:49.983 --> 29:52.254
Sometimes I like to
think I can make out

29:52.396 --> 29:55.857
clouds and weather systems.

29:56.602 --> 29:58.453
But no one's sure of that yet.

30:00.301 --> 30:01.465
It's amazing.

30:03.132 --> 30:06.242
A hundred years ago, astronomers
were looking up at the canals,

30:07.126 --> 30:10.712
convinced that intelligent
life was living there.

30:11.471 --> 30:13.455
And here we are now,

30:13.978 --> 30:16.127
looking up at that same planet,

30:17.156 --> 30:20.264
convinced that at any time now,

30:20.288 --> 30:21.734
it will be us living there.

32:24.970 --> 32:27.648
By the way, I've invited June and
Peter round for dinner tonight.

32:27.672 --> 32:28.944
June and Peter?

32:28.968 --> 32:30.921
Yeah, from next door.
Is that alright?

32:31.631 --> 32:35.127
Erm. OK. Why?

32:35.379 --> 32:36.994
Well I though it
might be nice Faye.

32:37.306 --> 32:40.368
They've been living there nearly three
months and we hardly know them, OK?

32:40.476 --> 32:41.522
OK.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.962
You doing your chicken thing?

32:45.106 --> 32:46.153
Of course.

32:47.002 --> 32:49.416
Hey, you know that
it's nearly 7.45?

32:51.587 --> 32:52.672
I'll see you this evening.

33:05.536 --> 33:08.030
So please leave your
message after the tone.

33:09.716 --> 33:13.396
Hello Mr. Anderson, it's
Faye Banks here. Erm...

33:13.698 --> 33:16.438
I'm really sorry but I'm not
really feeling myself today,

33:16.462 --> 33:18.977
and I'm not going to be
able to make it in to work.

33:20.122 --> 33:22.458
Sorry. Bye.

34:42.116 --> 34:44.944
Oh! Hello.

34:46.574 --> 34:47.771
I found this.

34:48.141 --> 34:49.726
Thought your daughter
might like it.

34:52.842 --> 34:53.873
Look Flossie.

34:54.931 --> 34:56.025
This is for you.

35:00.838 --> 35:02.994
Thanks Faye. This
is a nice surprise.

35:03.731 --> 35:05.137
Thanks for inviting
us over tonight.

35:05.289 --> 35:07.765
That's OK. It'll be nice.

35:09.033 --> 35:10.080
Are you not working today?

35:10.903 --> 35:12.262
I should be really.

35:12.912 --> 35:14.677
Maybe keep it hush hush tonight.

35:15.169 --> 35:16.169
Yeah sure.

35:16.872 --> 35:18.723
So what are you up to for
the rest of the day?

35:19.761 --> 35:21.714
Nothing at all actually.

35:22.618 --> 35:25.005
Well it looks like me and
Flossie are going into space.

35:26.208 --> 35:27.224
Sounds great.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.216
If you're not doing anything you're
more than welcome to join us.

35:30.364 --> 35:31.395
Flossie would love that.

35:34.351 --> 35:36.789
Yeah, OK.

35:39.153 --> 35:40.325
I'll come round.

35:56.814 --> 35:58.954
Roar!

35:59.223 --> 36:00.684
Are you a space dinosaur?

36:01.163 --> 36:02.257
Are you on the moon?

36:08.970 --> 36:10.867
- Is that better?
- Yes.

36:23.491 --> 36:26.827
Atishoo, atishoo,
we all fall down!

36:33.886 --> 36:36.448
What would you do if you had
the chance to go to Mars?

36:37.408 --> 36:39.127
You mean if I won Seat 25?

36:41.003 --> 36:42.003
Yeah.

36:43.975 --> 36:45.381
Well, there'd be a lot to lose.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.042
So you wouldn't go?

36:51.318 --> 36:54.229
I'm glad I'm not in the position
to have to make that choice.

37:50.688 --> 37:51.962
Teodor?

38:00.686 --> 38:01.694
Faye.

38:01.968 --> 38:04.312
I'm sorry, you're
front door was open.

38:05.134 --> 38:07.377
I hope you don't
mind me being here?

38:08.301 --> 38:10.137
I'll shut the door.

38:24.941 --> 38:26.808
I'm pleased to see you Faye.

38:27.863 --> 38:29.895
Please, sit down, sit down.

38:30.007 --> 38:31.476
Let me turn the music down.

38:37.447 --> 38:38.635
Would you like a drink?

38:39.278 --> 38:40.348
Thank you.

38:58.454 --> 39:00.852
I hope you don't mind
me coming to see you?

39:02.422 --> 39:04.274
I've been thinking about you.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.363
Passed your flat a few times,

39:06.629 --> 39:08.566
wondering how you are.

39:08.819 --> 39:10.451
That's very kind of you.

39:15.955 --> 39:17.776
I didn't know you
played the cello.

39:18.740 --> 39:20.506
Oh, I don't really.

39:21.573 --> 39:23.612
I try. It was left to me.

39:25.909 --> 39:28.065
Who's the woman in
the photographs?

39:28.674 --> 39:31.158
That's er, that's Marion,

39:31.906 --> 39:32.961
my wife.

39:33.361 --> 39:34.993
She died some time ago.

39:35.542 --> 39:36.854
I'm so sorry.

39:37.822 --> 39:39.650
In our home country

39:39.861 --> 39:41.838
she was a professional cellist.

39:43.126 --> 39:46.259
I persuaded her to come to
England, to follow her dream.

39:47.340 --> 39:50.543
In the end that was a mistake,
she never found success here.

39:51.756 --> 39:53.935
Did you ever think
about returning home?

39:55.399 --> 39:57.508
Life has a way of trapping you.

39:58.223 --> 39:59.489
Before we knew it

39:59.946 --> 40:01.422
ten years had passed.

40:01.683 --> 40:04.136
After so much time it's
difficult to change.

40:05.932 --> 40:07.217
You must miss her.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.784
In some ways I'm pleased

40:11.102 --> 40:13.056
she's not here to see me now.

40:13.888 --> 40:15.693
To see what's become of me.

40:16.842 --> 40:20.514
Oh Teodor, I felt so terrible
about letting you go.

40:21.470 --> 40:22.547
Not at all,

40:22.888 --> 40:24.747
it was probably what I needed.

40:27.877 --> 40:29.721
Are you going somewhere, Teodor?

40:32.556 --> 40:34.884
Yes, I thought I would.

40:36.103 --> 40:37.595
Will you be seeing your family?

40:39.811 --> 40:40.819
I think so.

40:44.470 --> 40:46.080
How long will you be gone?

40:47.235 --> 40:48.485
I have no idea.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.280
I may never come back.

40:52.173 --> 40:54.001
What about all your possessions?

40:55.034 --> 40:57.784
I have no interest in any
of this stuff anymore.

40:58.476 --> 41:01.991
But, your wife's cello,
your photographs.

41:03.306 --> 41:05.189
That instrument is not my wife.

41:05.467 --> 41:07.405
I don't see her
when I look at it.

41:08.414 --> 41:10.157
And when I try to play it,

41:10.476 --> 41:11.703
I'm not holding her.

41:12.218 --> 41:13.835
But when I hear music,

41:14.651 --> 41:15.651
I can hear her.

41:17.680 --> 41:19.938
I'm thinking of going away too.

41:20.271 --> 41:21.747
I thought you would eventually.

41:22.609 --> 41:24.015
Somewhere nice I hope?

41:25.564 --> 41:26.595
I hope so.

41:30.717 --> 41:32.780
I used to be just like you.

41:32.957 --> 41:34.660
I thought I had all the
time in the world.

41:34.806 --> 41:37.322
Then one day, I caught
myself in the mirror

41:37.491 --> 41:40.478
and I actually heard my
biological clock ticking,

41:40.502 --> 41:41.854
it was awful.

41:42.353 --> 41:45.010
But no one wants to be
an old Mum, do they?

41:45.034 --> 41:46.940
So I made a swift decision

41:47.301 --> 41:48.301
and got pregnant.

41:48.419 --> 41:49.492
You told them then?

41:49.516 --> 41:52.117
No. Oh, what's this?

41:52.223 --> 41:54.082
- It's nothing.
- We're trying for a baby.

41:54.344 --> 41:55.485
Really?

41:55.724 --> 41:57.107
- Yep.
- I'd never have guessed.

41:57.207 --> 41:58.231
Are you Faye?

41:58.421 --> 42:01.360
Oh goody, we can start
sharing horror stories then.

42:01.764 --> 42:03.709
Did I ever tell you about my

42:03.847 --> 42:08.144
agonising 72 hour
birthing nightmare?

42:08.596 --> 42:10.444
- Posted it all on Facebook.
- You didn't?

42:10.546 --> 42:13.592
People loved it. And the film.
You should do the same Faye.

42:13.697 --> 42:15.106
Faye doesn't do Facebook.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.782
Peter's the same. I
think it's so weird.

42:18.512 --> 42:21.858
Still, most women are only
on Facebook so they can

42:21.882 --> 42:23.206
- spy on their husbands.
- Well, I'll

42:23.218 --> 42:24.554
take that as a compliment then.

42:24.578 --> 42:25.854
Why are you on there then?

42:25.878 --> 42:28.870
Why indeed! I certainly
don't need to spy on Peter.

42:29.018 --> 42:31.252
He does jack all but sit
in the garden all day.

42:34.379 --> 42:37.192
Some people spend
all day working.

42:37.690 --> 42:40.223
Some people, who
have a boring job,

42:40.247 --> 42:41.543
- need a bit of
Facebook to break

42:41.555 --> 42:42.862
- the day up.
- Bet he loves it!

42:43.020 --> 42:46.066
Bet you sit at home all day watching
tennis, don't you Peter? I bloody would!

42:46.166 --> 42:47.166
Oh yeah?

42:47.292 --> 42:50.221
So you're going to send Faye off to
work after the baby's born are you?

42:50.363 --> 42:52.317
No of course not. Sorry,
no offence Peter.

42:52.454 --> 42:54.790
God, you are so lucky Faye.

42:55.059 --> 42:57.255
You're going to be able
to relax, away from work,

42:57.399 --> 42:59.860
meet up with the other
Mums and do baby talk,

42:59.961 --> 43:03.414
then wander round Mothercare, picking
out really cute little outfits.

43:03.690 --> 43:05.610
Faye was just born for
motherhood, weren't you?

43:05.794 --> 43:08.664
My beautiful wife and my great
kid just sitting at home,

43:08.688 --> 43:11.528
waiting for me to come back from work.
I mean, it's the dream, isn't it?

43:13.660 --> 43:14.699
I don't know.

43:16.267 --> 43:17.267
What do you mean?

43:19.926 --> 43:22.004
I don't think that's
what Faye wants.

43:22.488 --> 43:24.051
Of course that's what she wants.

43:24.449 --> 43:27.748
That's what normal people want.
Not everone's oulook on life

43:27.772 --> 43:29.285
- is as skewed as yours Peter.
- Well I

43:29.297 --> 43:30.821
mean, it's hoses for
courses, isn't it?

43:30.845 --> 43:32.264
- I'm sure whatever
works for Peter

43:32.276 --> 43:33.707
and June...
- It doesn't work for me

43:33.731 --> 43:35.530
and Peter, it works for Peter.

43:35.554 --> 43:37.226
I think you've had
enough to drink, June.

43:38.208 --> 43:39.653
Oh, well.

43:39.975 --> 43:42.172
Thank you for keeping an
eye on it Peter. You know

43:42.390 --> 43:45.381
for someone so liberal, you do a bloody
good job of telling me what to do.

43:45.405 --> 43:47.975
- Let's go to bed.
- And do what Peter?

43:49.300 --> 43:51.479
I'm thrilled you're
trying for a baby.

43:52.038 --> 43:53.546
At least we know
you're having sex.

44:03.777 --> 44:06.199
Thought she was going to throw
a plate at him at one point.

44:07.035 --> 44:08.663
- Poor Peter.
- What do you mean

44:08.675 --> 44:10.315
'poor Peter'? The
man's an idiot.

44:10.944 --> 44:12.483
June's a complete cow.

44:13.139 --> 44:14.662
Peter's a wet fish.

44:15.180 --> 44:17.765
How they ever got together in the
first place, I've got no idea.

44:17.789 --> 44:19.235
They make the worst couple.

44:19.510 --> 44:22.135
They must have started closer
together but grown apart.

44:23.414 --> 44:25.422
Sort of like the opposite
to us then, really.

44:26.291 --> 44:28.752
Jim, I don't ever want
to end up like them.

45:40.062 --> 45:41.335
About bloody time!

45:45.112 --> 45:46.284
Sorry Terry, sorry.

45:47.559 --> 45:48.567
No let me do that.

45:59.100 --> 46:00.107
That everything?

46:12.034 --> 46:14.893
For God's sake, pull
yourself together Maggie.

46:16.833 --> 46:18.192
What's wrong Maggie?

46:18.873 --> 46:20.397
Your Dad's what's wrong.

46:22.001 --> 46:23.946
My mother died in that bed.

46:24.794 --> 46:26.825
I wanted to die in it too.

46:26.958 --> 46:30.144
I've told you Maggie, I'm not
spending two thousand pounds

46:30.168 --> 46:32.485
to ship a mouldy old
bed over to Spain.

46:32.842 --> 46:34.286
We're going to get
a nice new one

46:34.310 --> 46:37.892
and then maybe I'll have a decent night's
sleep for the first time in ten years,

46:37.916 --> 46:39.212
and mind that car Jim.

46:49.242 --> 46:50.610
What terminal was
it again Terry?

46:50.924 --> 46:53.705
'One' Jim. Christ,
how many times boy.

46:54.344 --> 46:56.836
You got a blind bend
coming up here too.

47:00.068 --> 47:02.579
Do you think you'll ever come
back to England again Terry?

47:02.864 --> 47:04.919
Tell me what I'd
come back for Jim.

47:06.124 --> 47:07.334
The business runs itself.

47:07.358 --> 47:09.383
I can get the football
on Sky Sports.

47:09.874 --> 47:11.194
Food's better over there,

47:11.439 --> 47:12.757
weather's better over there,

47:12.781 --> 47:15.297
and at least I can speak English
and be understood over there.

47:15.507 --> 47:17.999
Do you know how working
class you sound Terry?

47:18.797 --> 47:21.397
Christ, where we're moving we're
going to have English neighbours.

47:21.719 --> 47:23.328
There's a bloody luxury.

47:24.945 --> 47:27.218
It's certainly going to take
a bit of getting used to.

47:27.470 --> 47:31.040
I mean, I haven't found a single
English hairdresser over there yet.

47:32.161 --> 47:34.044
And I will miss 'Marks'.

47:35.616 --> 47:38.740
At this rate I'll have to come back to
get my hair done and do my shopping.

47:45.407 --> 47:48.805
Your attention please. This
is a security announcement.

47:49.394 --> 47:52.913
Passengers are reminded not to leave
luggage or belongings unattended

47:52.937 --> 47:55.437
as they may be removed or
destroyed without warning

47:55.546 --> 47:57.186
by the security services.

48:12.435 --> 48:14.214
- You'll need this.
- Oh.

48:17.559 --> 48:18.824
I'm going to miss you Dad.

48:21.573 --> 48:23.972
Come on Maggs, let's not
miss the bloddy thing.

48:32.194 --> 48:34.464
Coming up to 17.35.

48:34.749 --> 48:37.256
And we're talking
again about Seat 25.

48:37.280 --> 48:38.858
And I'm thrilled to announce

48:39.056 --> 48:42.172
we will have Michael Macmillan
himself, joining us here...

48:42.344 --> 48:45.532
I've got to be honest, I can't
believe how selfish Dad's being.

48:45.811 --> 48:49.192
He didn't even ask me how I'd feel
about him taking early retirement.

48:49.216 --> 48:51.014
What am I supposed to do now?
He doesn't seem

48:51.026 --> 48:52.836
to care that I don't
have anywhere to live.

48:52.860 --> 48:54.719
You both have jobs, you
can afford a mortgage.

48:54.851 --> 48:57.069
I don't work and he hasn't
done anything to help.

48:57.246 --> 48:59.425
How long are you planning
on staying with us Pandora?

49:00.170 --> 49:01.709
We can help you get a job Pan

49:01.843 --> 49:03.850
and then we can look for
somewhere you can rent.

49:03.979 --> 49:05.534
I don't want a job Faye.

49:05.757 --> 49:07.718
I'm not like you, I
can't be tied down.

49:08.572 --> 49:11.077
Well you've got your Yoga retreat
in a few weeks, haven't you?

49:11.101 --> 49:13.761
As if I can afford
to go on that now.

49:15.118 --> 49:17.517
If Macmillan wants to
race NASA to Mars,

49:17.620 --> 49:19.346
why doesn't he go himself?

49:19.484 --> 49:20.515
Good question.

49:20.717 --> 49:22.459
And Helen from East
Grinstead tweets:

49:22.639 --> 49:25.279
As long as my taxes don't
end up being spent

49:25.303 --> 49:27.998
retrieving twenty-five
rotting bodies from Mars,

49:28.376 --> 49:29.920
it's all right with me.

49:29.944 --> 49:31.975
I reckon dying in space

49:31.999 --> 49:34.354
must be like, the
worst way to die.

49:34.709 --> 49:36.316
Even though it only
lasts a minute or so,

49:36.417 --> 49:39.295
can you imagine the agony? You know
your tongue and your eyes freeze

49:39.319 --> 49:41.984
and your blood boils in your veins
and then you turn like, blue?

49:42.008 --> 49:43.976
I don't think that's
very likely Pandora.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.304
It is, isn't it Faye?

49:45.504 --> 49:46.910
I suppose that can happen.

49:47.062 --> 49:49.084
And you swell up
to twice your size

49:49.108 --> 49:51.021
and your lungs burst
like balloons.

49:51.243 --> 49:54.795
Jesus Christ. Sounds like you'd
have to be pretty bloody brave.

49:54.819 --> 49:57.273
No, you have to be
really selfish.

49:57.878 --> 50:01.385
You know most of them are leaving wives and
children behind to go on this ego trip?

50:01.530 --> 50:03.370
- Would you pull over please Jim?
- What?

50:03.631 --> 50:04.639
I don't feel well.

50:04.747 --> 50:06.934
Look, there'll be a service
station on the motorway.

50:06.958 --> 50:08.623
Would you pull over, please Jim!

50:36.088 --> 50:39.142
Advances in science,
medicine, technology.

50:39.166 --> 50:42.471
These are the thing that will
be firing these brave people.

50:43.390 --> 50:46.755
These explorers may have felt
deep isolation here on Earth.

50:46.897 --> 50:50.030
They may be disillusioned with
the path their lives have taken.

50:50.226 --> 50:53.976
But these are people who
care deeply about humanity.

50:54.960 --> 50:57.949
These people won't be thinking
about what they'll be losing,

50:58.801 --> 51:00.637
but about what
they'll be gaining.

51:01.605 --> 51:05.261
This mission isn't
about running away.

51:06.038 --> 51:09.491
It'll be an opportunity for them
to fall in love with life again.

51:34.732 --> 51:37.693
Faye. Where are you going?

51:38.533 --> 51:40.695
Please Jim, stop following me.

51:41.008 --> 51:43.159
Er, why? What's the matter?

51:43.606 --> 51:45.262
Go away.

51:46.784 --> 51:47.792
Fine.

51:48.239 --> 51:49.254
Jim...

51:52.367 --> 51:53.469
You're pathetic.

51:54.579 --> 51:55.900
I'm leaving you.

51:56.687 --> 51:57.718
No you're not.

51:58.613 --> 52:01.760
I don't know what the hell is wrong with
you at the moment, but I'm sick of it.

52:02.098 --> 52:04.547
- It's not about you.
- You're damn right it's not about me.

52:05.849 --> 52:07.552
I've always been there for you.

52:07.874 --> 52:09.530
I mean, where are your friends?

52:10.302 --> 52:11.591
Where are your family?

52:11.950 --> 52:14.473
I'm all you've got left and
this is how you treat me.

52:14.694 --> 52:16.967
- I'm sorry.
- But that's not good enough.

52:31.928 --> 52:33.397
Things have got to change.

52:35.022 --> 52:36.498
I don't know how to change?

53:49.191 --> 53:51.824
Hello Faye, my name is Jeanie.

53:52.200 --> 53:54.796
I'm from Macmillan Enterprises.
Can I come in?

54:00.782 --> 54:02.571
Please, sit down Faye.

54:13.286 --> 54:16.340
Well first of all, I'd like
to say congratulations.

54:16.610 --> 54:17.860
You must be thrilled.

54:18.060 --> 54:20.451
I'm a personal representative
of Mike Macmillan.

54:20.702 --> 54:22.834
I'm sorry he couldn't
be here today but

54:22.858 --> 54:25.263
I'm afraid he doesn't like to
leave the Hub much anymore.

54:25.609 --> 54:27.837
Unfortunately the press
have managed to get

54:27.849 --> 54:30.089
information about our
competition winner and

54:30.113 --> 54:34.066
will at this moment be finding out
that it is you who have won Seat 25.

54:45.417 --> 54:47.913
Now, I'm sure you are aware

54:47.937 --> 54:51.167
that the ticket you have recently
won is extremely valuable

54:51.273 --> 54:53.273
and must be treated accordingly.

54:53.576 --> 54:57.048
Do you realise how many people would
want to take that ticket from you Faye?

54:57.687 --> 54:59.843
How much that ticket
could be worth?

55:00.476 --> 55:02.218
Well, if you're happy with that,

55:02.405 --> 55:04.741
I'd like to briefly talk about
the contract, if I may?

55:05.031 --> 55:08.320
At the moment, you have only shown
an interest in our mission to Mars

55:08.437 --> 55:11.312
and are under no obligation
to take things further.

55:11.761 --> 55:14.699
Of course, we are extremely
hopeful that you will join us

55:14.969 --> 55:18.076
and so we are inviting you to a
primary meeting with Mr. Macmillan,

55:18.224 --> 55:20.044
this Friday at the Hub.

55:20.546 --> 55:21.757
All OK?

55:23.149 --> 55:25.360
You may feel alone
at the moment Faye

55:25.728 --> 55:28.478
but you're certainly not.
Do you inderstand?

55:30.488 --> 55:32.145
Goodbye then Faye.

55:32.575 --> 55:35.090
We are all so looking forward
to getting to know you better.

55:42.466 --> 55:44.576
Yes, as we expected.

55:44.998 --> 55:46.091
Not to worry.

55:46.218 --> 55:48.247
If you have any problems
just let us know.

55:48.459 --> 55:49.639
You know where we are.

55:50.212 --> 55:51.345
Godbye then Faye.

56:19.973 --> 56:21.231
Morning.

56:21.684 --> 56:23.043
I had the worst night's sleep.

56:23.233 --> 56:24.795
And that room gives
me the creeps.

56:25.053 --> 56:27.585
I'm surprised Jim lets you
put up all that space crap.

56:27.695 --> 56:28.991
Put the kettle on, would you?

56:30.966 --> 56:33.400
Coffee, yes.

56:39.354 --> 56:42.464
The BBC reckon they know
who's won the Seat 25 thing.

56:42.665 --> 56:44.352
They're about to
announce it apparently.

56:48.041 --> 56:50.064
Oi! I was watching that.

56:50.308 --> 56:53.558
The identity of the Seat
25 competition winner

56:53.683 --> 56:55.292
has finally been revealed.

56:56.310 --> 56:59.482
We've had our information confirmed
by Macmillan Enterprises

56:59.634 --> 57:01.593
and have just had a
personal announcement...

57:01.617 --> 57:03.404
Er, Faye?

57:03.698 --> 57:06.273
Did you know there's a load of
people standing in the driveway?

57:06.663 --> 57:08.226
What the hell are they doing?

57:08.759 --> 57:10.243
Erm, hello?

57:10.649 --> 57:11.899
What are you doing?

57:12.579 --> 57:13.969
Go away.

57:14.438 --> 57:16.602
They must have the wrong
house or something.

57:17.825 --> 57:18.848
What the...

57:19.015 --> 57:21.789
That woman just took a
photo of me, cheeky cow!

57:37.020 --> 57:39.387
What's happening?
What have I done?

57:39.812 --> 57:42.594
You haven't really
won Seat 25 Faye.

57:43.175 --> 57:45.112
I mean, they've oviously
made a mistake.

57:45.746 --> 57:48.016
No. I won it.

57:48.396 --> 57:49.424
What?

57:49.775 --> 57:51.088
Everyone's going to know now.

57:51.206 --> 57:52.847
Jim! Jim's going to find out!

57:53.248 --> 57:54.326
You haven't told Jim?

57:54.480 --> 57:55.558
I meant to.

57:55.700 --> 57:57.200
Bloody hell Faye!

57:57.629 --> 57:59.762
You decide to go to Mars forever

58:00.313 --> 58:01.836
and you forget to
tell your husband?

58:06.033 --> 58:09.923
Oh crap. Jim's back Faye and
he doesn't look very happy.

58:10.724 --> 58:12.779
It looks like he's
arguing with someone.

58:13.003 --> 58:15.253
Oh, Jim's having a fight
with one of them.

58:16.105 --> 58:19.433
OMG! He's just punched
a man in the face!

58:19.861 --> 58:23.079
- Come look Faye! Faye?
- Tell Jim I'm not here.

58:27.996 --> 58:29.011
Where is she?

58:29.935 --> 58:30.935
Upstairs.

58:37.277 --> 58:38.746
What the hell is going on Faye?

58:38.876 --> 58:41.040
- Please Jim, let me explain.
- Is it true?

58:42.256 --> 58:44.314
Just tell me, is it true?

58:44.338 --> 58:45.424
- Yes.
- Christ!

58:45.605 --> 58:47.613
- But listen...
- No, you listen.

58:48.044 --> 58:50.301
Do you know how humiliating
this is for me?

58:50.737 --> 58:52.690
Were you trying to
make me look stupid?

58:52.812 --> 58:54.771
No, I was trying to tell you,

58:54.795 --> 58:57.646
- I've been trying to tell you.
- Tell me what?

58:57.901 --> 59:01.051
What, that you fancy flying off to
the other side of the Solar System?

59:01.075 --> 59:03.200
For what? A holiday?

59:03.802 --> 59:05.270
What is going on

59:05.294 --> 59:07.684
- in that stupid little head of yours?
- Stop it.

59:08.826 --> 59:10.216
This is a marriage Faye.

59:10.240 --> 59:12.349
- But I'm not happy.
- Neither am I.

59:13.171 --> 59:15.576
You don't make me happy Faye.

59:15.600 --> 59:17.685
You make no attempt
to make me happy.

59:17.903 --> 59:19.553
- I've tried. It's
not that I don't

59:19.565 --> 59:21.227
care about you.
- Oh, don't you dare.

59:21.251 --> 59:23.987
Don't you dare try and make out
like this is somehow my fault.

59:24.011 --> 59:26.312
No! No, this is no one's fault,

59:26.336 --> 59:28.297
- this just isn't working anymore.
- Faye!

59:28.565 --> 59:29.971
Faye, come back!

59:30.505 --> 59:31.872
I'm sorry!

01:02:19.051 --> 01:02:20.075
Can't go in there.

01:02:21.131 --> 01:02:22.131
What's happened?

01:02:22.684 --> 01:02:23.879
Killed himself, hasn't he?

01:02:24.301 --> 01:02:25.355
Teodor?

01:02:25.504 --> 01:02:26.504
I don't know his name.

01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:29.738
One of my kids saw him through the
window, hanging from a light fitting.

01:02:31.307 --> 01:02:32.549
Nasty shock for him.

01:02:33.963 --> 01:02:36.240
Mind you, I suppose he sees
worse on his computer games.

01:02:37.514 --> 01:02:38.538
How d'you know him?

01:02:38.651 --> 01:02:39.690
We work together.

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:41.487
Oh, so he did work then?

01:02:41.737 --> 01:02:43.276
Better than most of
them round here.

01:02:44.667 --> 01:02:46.003
Wonder what made him do it.

01:02:49.456 --> 01:02:51.031
Nasty way to go.

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:09.396
Excuse me.

01:03:09.824 --> 01:03:10.895
DC Poole.

01:03:11.964 --> 01:03:13.269
Can I have a quick word please?

01:03:14.429 --> 01:03:16.069
I saw you up at the door there.

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:17.661
Are you a family member?

01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:19.680
Erm, no, we work together.

01:03:19.821 --> 01:03:21.555
- He's a friend.
- And you are?

01:03:22.035 --> 01:03:24.261
Er, Faye. Faye Banks.

01:03:24.907 --> 01:03:27.242
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Popescu?

01:03:27.524 --> 01:03:29.375
I saw him two nights ago

01:03:29.528 --> 01:03:31.434
but he was meant to
be leaving today.

01:03:31.726 --> 01:03:34.461
- Leaving?
- He was going to see his family.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.312
- Family?
- Yes.

01:03:39.835 --> 01:03:41.521
Look, I'm sorry to
have to tell you this,

01:03:41.545 --> 01:03:45.061
but Mr. Popescu died in the early
hours of yesterday morning.

01:03:46.169 --> 01:03:47.857
It doesn't make any sense.

01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:51.246
Do you get the impression he
was unhappy about anything?

01:03:51.417 --> 01:03:52.448
I don't know.

01:03:53.836 --> 01:03:55.375
He said he was going home.

01:03:56.350 --> 01:03:59.061
You mentioned you were work
colleagues, is that right?

01:03:59.191 --> 01:04:00.886
Yes, we worked together
for the council

01:04:01.079 --> 01:04:03.165
but he, he left quite recently.

01:04:03.342 --> 01:04:05.792
I see. And Mr. Popescu told you

01:04:05.816 --> 01:04:07.343
-he was going to visit his

01:04:07.355 --> 01:04:08.894
- family, is that right?
- Yes.

01:04:09.634 --> 01:04:12.501
Right. Only,

01:04:13.436 --> 01:04:15.882
Mr. Popescu didn't
have any family.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.379
So what was so remarkable
about Helen Sharman?

01:05:51.539 --> 01:05:54.071
Not only was she the
first Briton in space,

01:05:54.347 --> 01:05:55.797
she was also a woman.

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:58.634
How many of you girls will
leave such an impression?

01:06:08.485 --> 01:06:10.594
He's completely
wrong for you Faye.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.264
I don't know what
you want me to say.

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:31.839
I know it's not in
science, but it's a job.

01:06:33.596 --> 01:06:34.900
We need the money.

01:07:40.506 --> 01:07:42.003
Faye, where have you been?

01:07:53.911 --> 01:07:55.177
Are you leaving?

01:08:01.213 --> 01:08:02.338
Yes.

01:08:04.763 --> 01:08:07.521
I never for a moment
thought they'd choose me,

01:08:08.904 --> 01:08:11.606
but now they have, I have to go.

01:08:12.686 --> 01:08:14.366
I'm so sorry.

01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:19.538
Remember when we first met?

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:23.586
Yes.

01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:28.696
It was at that traffic light party when
David and Susie started going out.

01:08:29.944 --> 01:08:31.055
No it wasn't.

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:37.845
No, it was Diane's party when she
had the giant chocolate horse.

01:08:38.895 --> 01:08:42.232
I went with my mate Phil, because
he was trying to pull Diane.

01:08:43.263 --> 01:08:45.513
I'd totally forgotten
about that.

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:51.810
You were so quiet
and shy back then.

01:08:54.538 --> 01:08:57.008
She must have said something
that really pissed you off,

01:08:58.107 --> 01:09:00.389
because you snapped
the horses head off.

01:09:03.453 --> 01:09:06.100
Phil always blamed you for
never getting with Diane.

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:13.170
Don't go.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.723
I do love you Jim.

01:10:20.031 --> 01:10:21.499
- Hi Peter.
- Faye.

01:10:23.103 --> 01:10:26.345
Is it true? Are you
going to Mars?

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:28.641
Yeah.

01:10:29.447 --> 01:10:30.447
Bugger me.

01:10:31.508 --> 01:10:32.539
So when are you going?

01:10:32.909 --> 01:10:35.065
Pretty soon. For the training.

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:37.567
We'll miss you.

01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:41.730
I'll miss you too. And Flossie.

01:10:45.163 --> 01:10:46.925
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

01:10:48.759 --> 01:10:49.970
Barely.

01:10:50.988 --> 01:10:53.589
I just know I have to go.

01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:58.574
How did Jim take it?

01:11:00.937 --> 01:11:03.261
It's difficult. But he's...

01:11:03.285 --> 01:11:05.940
You don't have to go all the way
to Mars to run away from him.

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:08.178
What?

01:11:08.913 --> 01:11:10.468
You're giving up on everything.

01:11:11.363 --> 01:11:12.987
Life could still be
good for you here.

01:11:13.089 --> 01:11:14.988
I've made up my mind Peter.

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:20.138
Right, OK.

01:11:22.001 --> 01:11:23.360
Well I guess this is goodbye.

01:11:24.567 --> 01:11:26.372
Oh. Yeah.

01:11:27.982 --> 01:11:29.147
Keep in touch.

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:31.959
Yeah. Of course.

01:11:53.099 --> 01:11:54.949
Do you know, since
yesterday I've had, like,

01:11:54.973 --> 01:11:56.630
900 new followers on twitter?

01:12:05.522 --> 01:12:07.065
Oh, Maggie called last night.

01:12:07.686 --> 01:12:09.655
She said Dad's really
disappointed in you.

01:12:12.093 --> 01:12:13.929
Don't worry, I'll call them.

01:12:44.148 --> 01:12:45.557
Faye's journey to work,

01:12:45.581 --> 01:12:48.339
affords her an average of
seventeen minutes, twice a day,

01:12:48.879 --> 01:12:52.137
which she fills wondering at
the life of total strangers.

01:12:55.635 --> 01:12:56.862
What are their hopes?

01:12:58.023 --> 01:12:59.312
What are their fears?

01:13:00.618 --> 01:13:01.634
Are they happy?

01:13:09.684 --> 01:13:12.700
With Faye's life now stretching
so far ahead of her,

01:13:14.517 --> 01:13:16.232
the empty faces
staring back at her

01:13:16.339 --> 01:13:19.792
made her feel as though she was looking
at our world from a great distance.

01:13:21.873 --> 01:13:24.717
Her former colleagues now
serving only to remind her,

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:28.233
of the total insignificance
of everything.

01:13:30.846 --> 01:13:32.245
That, no matter what,

01:13:32.889 --> 01:13:35.162
the Earth will keep turning.

01:13:39.655 --> 01:13:42.171
This is the story of
an ordinary woman.

01:13:43.596 --> 01:13:45.361
But like all ordinary people,

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:50.337
she is capable of doing
something extraordinary.

01:13:57.428 --> 01:13:58.436
This is Faye.

01:13:59.406 --> 01:14:00.453
Or, Faye Banks.

01:14:02.449 --> 01:14:03.589
This is her life.

01:14:05.397 --> 01:14:06.412
Or at least,

01:14:06.747 --> 01:14:08.153
her life so far.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.027
Hello brave girl.

01:14:47.699 --> 01:14:50.654
Thank you. It's nice to
meet you Mr. Macmillan.

01:14:50.678 --> 01:14:52.514
No, the pleasure's all mine.

01:15:02.383 --> 01:15:04.188
T minus 2 minutes to launch.

01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:08.317
Initiative One is on internal power.
Setting SCE to auxilliary.

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:10.334
Roger that flight.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:14.502
Faye, you are extraordinary.

01:15:15.281 --> 01:15:17.796
Your application
moved me incredibly.

01:15:18.451 --> 01:15:20.170
You remind me of me,

01:15:20.647 --> 01:15:23.280
when I was a boy,
looking out at Mars,

01:15:23.505 --> 01:15:25.435
totally convinced that one day

01:15:25.582 --> 01:15:27.355
we would be standing
on it's surface.

01:15:28.036 --> 01:15:30.192
I am so proud

01:15:30.733 --> 01:15:32.054
to meet you Faye.

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:36.613
You are prepared to face the
adventure, despite the risks,

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:41.520
and I'm more than a little touched
that you're putting your trust in me.

01:15:43.246 --> 01:15:44.410
But how are you feeling?

01:15:45.623 --> 01:15:46.755
I don't know.

01:15:48.009 --> 01:15:49.384
Nauseous?

01:15:50.444 --> 01:15:51.521
Guilty.

01:15:51.545 --> 01:15:54.518
I can't pretend to understand how
difficult this must be for you.

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:57.946
If I'm honest,

01:15:59.073 --> 01:16:01.315
I can't see why you chose me.

01:16:01.928 --> 01:16:03.960
I'm not sure what
I have to offer.

01:16:04.164 --> 01:16:06.625
You say that I'm brave

01:16:06.922 --> 01:16:08.539
and extraordinary.

01:16:09.579 --> 01:16:12.810
- But I don't feel any of that.
- And yet, here you are.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.204
In spite of every obstacle.

01:16:15.228 --> 01:16:18.071
Can you imagine how many people
would have buckled by now?

01:16:18.266 --> 01:16:19.343
I can.

01:16:20.212 --> 01:16:23.197
The journey is nothing, Faye.

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:28.809
It is always the first
step which is the hardest.

01:16:29.761 --> 01:16:32.852
Fourteen, thirteen, twelve,

01:16:33.435 --> 01:16:36.224
eleven, ten, nine,

01:16:36.889 --> 01:16:39.600
eight, seven, six,

01:16:39.738 --> 01:16:44.031
main engine start,
three, two, one,

01:16:44.188 --> 01:16:46.438
lift off, we have lift off.

01:16:54.534 --> 01:16:55.737
Approaching 2 Gs.

01:16:59.036 --> 01:17:00.146
2.5.

01:17:13.956 --> 01:17:15.807
Roger, throttling up.

01:17:18.789 --> 01:17:19.922
3 Gs.

01:17:21.527 --> 01:17:22.535
Three and a half.

01:17:24.875 --> 01:17:25.875
4 Gs.

01:17:35.038 --> 01:17:37.077
This is the final transmission

01:17:37.237 --> 01:17:38.901
from the interplanetary craft,

01:17:39.001 --> 01:17:40.121
Initiative One,

01:17:40.391 --> 01:17:41.688
approaching the horizon

01:17:41.978 --> 01:17:44.431
of the Martian
electormagnetic anomaly.

01:17:45.382 --> 01:17:46.757
We leave the Earth behind

01:17:46.955 --> 01:17:48.479
with hope for it's future.

01:17:48.931 --> 01:17:50.626
As we pass into silence,

01:17:51.065 --> 01:17:53.401
we take with us the
voice of humanity.

01:17:54.513 --> 01:17:55.978
- To our families
and loved ones,

01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:57.466
we send our eternal... -

01:18:02.022 --> 01:18:03.947
This is Initiative One.

01:18:04.151 --> 01:18:07.425
