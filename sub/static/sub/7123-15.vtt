00:33.935 --> 00:36.702
Okay, now make him look angrier.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.836
All right, give me a
second...

00:39.838 --> 00:41.737
Nope.
Not funny anymore.

00:41.739 --> 00:44.238
- Sorry, dude. You ruined it.
- Man, I don't have the

00:44.240 --> 00:45.838
patience for this animation
junk.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.906
Whoever does this must have no
life whatsoev--

00:47.908 --> 00:50.241
oof!
Why did I do that?

00:50.243 --> 00:52.307
Huh?

00:52.309 --> 00:54.509
Yo, finn, did you order
a brick?

00:54.511 --> 00:56.842
- Mm, I don't think so.
- False alarm.

00:56.844 --> 00:58.676
- It's just an e-mail.
- Who's it from?

00:58.678 --> 01:02.645
Looks like ice king's
handwriting.

01:11.482 --> 01:15.116
- Ugh!
- Ohh!

01:15.118 --> 01:17.884
- Escape, Jake! Escape!
- All right, all right,

01:17.886 --> 01:19.418
hold on.
I think I can...

01:19.420 --> 01:21.152
Aw, man.

01:21.154 --> 01:24.053
Thing must've had a computer
worm in it.

01:24.055 --> 01:27.621
Whaaaa?

01:30.723 --> 01:33.223
- Hi, princess!
- What now,

01:33.225 --> 01:35.323
ice king?
Remember that time

01:35.325 --> 01:38.391
last summer when you said you'd
only go out on a date with me if

01:38.393 --> 01:41.659
- I was the last guy on ooo?
- I doubt I said

01:41.661 --> 01:43.226
that.

01:43.228 --> 01:48.495
P-bubs! P-bubs! P-bubs!

01:48.497 --> 01:50.463
- The computer went...
- Open video and...

01:50.465 --> 01:52.264
- The e-mail...
- Potato trampoline...

01:52.266 --> 01:53.764
Brick window with the
plastic...

01:53.766 --> 01:55.298
- Banana hummingbird...
- 47 grapes...

01:55.300 --> 01:58.566
Ahem.
Anyone having any computer

01:58.568 --> 02:02.600
problems?

02:02.602 --> 02:05.035
How do we stop that
computer worm, you pile of goo!

02:05.037 --> 02:08.502
My worm exists beyond your

02:08.505 --> 02:11.404
comprehension, within the
universal source code.

02:11.406 --> 02:14.472
Stop talkin' like a
nerd and give it to us straight!

02:14.474 --> 02:17.940
Once the glitch
does its work, the whole world

02:17.942 --> 02:21.175
will be deleted, except for me
and my bubblygums.

02:21.177 --> 02:23.542
Mwah!

02:23.544 --> 02:27.277
Mwah, mwah!
Mwah! Mwah!

02:27.279 --> 02:28.710
Mwah!
Ow!

02:28.712 --> 02:31.878
Well, see you all.

02:31.880 --> 02:36.513
I'm gonna prepare for my...
Date.

02:36.515 --> 02:39.648
Whee-ha-haw!

02:39.650 --> 02:43.750
Aaah! My beautiful face!
My hopes and dreams ruined!

02:43.752 --> 02:46.317
Don't worry, princess.

02:46.319 --> 02:49.585
- We'll take care of this thing.
- Oh, me, too.

02:49.587 --> 02:54.720
- I'm gonna take care of it, too.
- Okay!

02:54.722 --> 02:58.555
Don't worry, guy!

02:58.557 --> 03:00.789
I got you!
Yee-aah!

03:00.791 --> 03:03.090
- Jake, help me!
- Okay, shh.

03:03.092 --> 03:06.158
- You're safe.
- Come here, guy.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.425
- No, get away from me!
- I'm trying to help you,

03:08.427 --> 03:10.093
yo!
I saw what happened when you

03:10.095 --> 03:12.760
- picked up Todd.
- But...

03:12.762 --> 03:16.195
Nooooo!
Jake, this isn't working!

03:16.197 --> 03:19.696
- We need a plan.

03:21.631 --> 03:24.965
Oh, man!

03:24.967 --> 03:28.333
Okay, here's my dream plan.
You were wearing tights made of

03:28.335 --> 03:30.767
<i>green feathers -- these tiny
green feathers.</i>

03:30.769 --> 03:33.268
And I was this wise-cracking
coelacanth that only ate

03:33.270 --> 03:35.068
popcorn.
Anyway, we were in this --

03:35.070 --> 03:37.002
- That plan's not good!
- Hold on.

03:37.004 --> 03:39.404
I'm almost done.
So, we were trapped inside this

03:39.406 --> 03:42.805
huge egg, and after a while, you
started dancing in this kind of

03:42.807 --> 03:44.972
sign language.
And then ice king's glitchy

03:44.974 --> 03:46.773
stuff started eating my dream
up.

03:46.775 --> 03:49.974
I peed my pants, but you went up
and talked to it.

03:49.976 --> 03:54.676
- You just...Talked to it.
- Then talk to it I will!

03:54.678 --> 03:57.577
Hey, man, tell me the haps.

03:57.579 --> 04:00.245
Yeah, tell us your
feelings. Get deep.

04:02.746 --> 04:07.280
"Sllabfoog uoy pleh t'nac I."
Oh, sweet lord, my face!

04:07.282 --> 04:11.349
"Slaw frog yokel snacky."
"Snacky slaw frog yokel."

04:11.351 --> 04:14.150
"Sea salt yack let a snacky."
Yeah, that sounds good.

04:14.152 --> 04:15.750
Jake, I think I found a
way in!

04:15.752 --> 04:17.750
No, wait, dude!
I think I cracked the code!

04:17.753 --> 04:21.552
- There's no time!
- Aaaah!

04:42.863 --> 04:47.729
This must be the
universal source code.

04:47.731 --> 04:51.331
Huh?
Ice king and bubblegum?

04:51.333 --> 04:59.400
Hmm.

04:59.402 --> 05:03.668
Jake, don't touch

05:03.670 --> 05:05.102
- anything!
- Huh?

05:05.104 --> 05:07.237
I think these shiny
things are the building blocks

05:07.239 --> 05:09.871
of the universe, man.
They store every single thing

05:09.873 --> 05:13.572
- that's a thing back on thing.
- Okay, enough explorin'

05:13.574 --> 05:15.739
already.
Where's this glitch guy?

05:15.741 --> 05:17.607
I'm gonna smash his jimmies!

05:21.610 --> 05:25.910
Jake, what is it?
Huh?

05:32.847 --> 05:34.880
Unh!

05:34.882 --> 05:36.914
Oh,
princess bubblegum!

05:36.916 --> 05:39.182
Guess who!
Can you guess? Can you?

05:39.184 --> 05:41.682
- I'll give you three chances.
- No.

05:41.684 --> 05:44.617
Okay, four chances.

05:44.619 --> 05:47.918
Ice king, give me
the antivirus, or I'll shoot you

05:47.920 --> 05:50.119
with my candy horse
tranquilizer.

05:50.121 --> 05:52.953
But, sugar, look
what I brought you -- a box of

05:52.955 --> 05:55.321
chocos.
Ugh!

05:55.323 --> 05:58.456
Mmm!
Still good.

05:58.458 --> 06:02.257
Ugh!
Look, I can't prove it, but --

06:02.259 --> 06:05.958
you made a promise that I'd have
at least one date if --

06:05.960 --> 06:09.693
If I was the last
person on ooooooo...

06:09.695 --> 06:17.696
Y-o-o-ou promi-I-I-I-I-sed...

06:17.698 --> 06:20.831
Okay. Well, even if I did

06:20.833 --> 06:24.565
<i>promise, you're not the last
person on ooo because I'm still</i>

06:24.567 --> 06:28.901
here.

06:28.903 --> 06:36.036
Uh...
Ooh. Hey, I have a hand, too,

06:36.038 --> 06:38.870
you know.
If I can lend you one...

06:38.872 --> 06:41.472
- Check out my cool hand!
- Ugh!

06:41.474 --> 06:43.872
That's disgusting.

06:43.874 --> 06:48.308
Come on, Jake.
Pull it together, man.

06:48.310 --> 06:53.209
- Jake?
- Oh, no! My arm!

06:53.211 --> 06:54.809
We had so many great times
together.

06:54.811 --> 06:57.344
♪ Doo bee doo bee doo bee doo ♪
♪ skibble Dee skibble Dee ♪

06:57.346 --> 07:00.979
♪ bibbity boppty doo ♪
huh? Who was that?

07:00.981 --> 07:04.347
Aww!

07:04.349 --> 07:08.849
Whoo!
Let's do this -- for righty!

07:08.851 --> 07:11.850
That's the spirit!
Adventure ti--

07:11.852 --> 07:13.717
oh, my gams.
Hold up, dude!

07:13.719 --> 07:18.286
- My body's changing!

07:18.288 --> 07:26.888
No.

07:26.890 --> 07:30.089
Oh, come on, woman!
I'm trying to be nice!

07:30.091 --> 07:32.991
Can't you at least make the best
out of this?

07:32.993 --> 07:35.492
Whoa-ho-ho!
Are you praying to me?

07:35.494 --> 07:38.059
I'm into this.
Whoa!

07:38.061 --> 07:40.160
I'm still into this.
Ohh!

07:40.162 --> 07:41.861
Still into it.
Aah!

07:41.863 --> 07:44.029
Give me the
antivirus!

07:44.031 --> 07:46.196
I can't,
monkey peeps.

07:46.198 --> 07:48.597
I didn't make one.
The glitch will delete

07:48.599 --> 07:50.931
everything until we're all
that's left.

07:50.933 --> 07:53.532
- You mean forever?
- Well, yeah.

07:53.534 --> 07:55.466
I mean, you say that like it's
a bad thing.

07:55.468 --> 07:58.167
Oh, come on, finn
and Jake.

08:02.069 --> 08:04.536
So, hey, finn, how you
plan on taking this guy out?

08:04.538 --> 08:06.370
Okay.

08:06.372 --> 08:08.238
I guess it's worth a try.

08:39.884 --> 08:44.718
Aah!

08:44.720 --> 08:47.052
- What do we do now?!
- We got to get those

08:47.054 --> 08:51.087
things out of his stomach.

08:51.089 --> 08:53.588
Hey, finn!
Remember that gross video

08:53.590 --> 08:56.322
- ice king sent?
- Ugh! Yeah.

08:56.324 --> 08:58.189
Yeah!

09:01.959 --> 09:04.192
Let's double-team
these locks!

09:31.669 --> 09:43.807
Hey!

09:43.809 --> 09:47.975
We did it!

09:47.977 --> 09:49.442
You should wash your
hair.

09:49.444 --> 09:52.643
You should wash your
mouth.

09:52.645 --> 09:56.778
Huh?! No way!
Impossible!

09:56.780 --> 09:59.879
Uh...

09:59.881 --> 10:01.980
Everything back to
normal, huh?

10:01.982 --> 10:04.248
Seems like it.
Aah! My face!

10:04.250 --> 10:07.916
My beautiful face is back to
Norma-a-a-a-a-a-l!

10:07.918 --> 10:10.116
- Aaaaaaah!
- Hey, you seen the

10:10.118 --> 10:12.217
princess?
Yeah, she's in the

10:12.219 --> 10:15.318
ice king's castle!
Aaaaah!

10:15.320 --> 10:17.786
Useless
computer!

10:17.788 --> 10:21.654
You sassafrassin

10:21.656 --> 10:25.489
Hammaslammin

10:25.491 --> 10:30.224
Aah-yaa-yaa-yaa-yaaaaaaaah!

10:30.226 --> 10:32.825
Finn and Jake!
My heroes!

10:32.827 --> 10:35.759
Yeah, no big deal.
Sheesh!

10:35.761 --> 10:38.927
I missed you.
I missed you, too.

10:38.929 --> 10:42.996
Whoa. You taste different, baby.

10:42.998 --> 10:45.363
You been playing basketball in
someone else's hockey rink?

10:45.365 --> 10:47.831
Hey, bubs, where's ice king?

10:47.833 --> 10:50.331
- I want to kick his boingloings.
- Yeah, where is he?

10:50.333 --> 10:53.933
I want to kick his boingloings,
too!

10:53.935 --> 10:58.434
Uh...Guys?
Hello?

10:58.436 --> 11:04.470
Princess?
Let's forget all about this.

11:04.472 --> 11:08.905
Oh, get of me, you creep!
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow
