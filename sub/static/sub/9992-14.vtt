WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:07.442
How you doing?

00:09.141 --> 00:09.987
Tired, right?

00:10.682 --> 00:11.317
Sleepy?

00:13.349 --> 00:14.081
That's okay.

00:15.018 --> 00:16.457
Just relax. Go with it.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.274
Close your eyes if you want.

00:20.109 --> 00:21.179
Lay down back there.

00:21.854 --> 00:22.699
It's okay with me.

00:26.205 --> 00:26.943
Damn.

00:31.485 --> 00:33.718
You want to see your mommy, you don't say anything.

00:34.552 --> 00:35.461
You just go to sleep.

00:38.860 --> 00:40.184
License and registration, please.

00:42.753 --> 00:43.729
What do you got back here?

00:44.791 --> 00:47.014
My niece. Heading home from the circus.

00:47.313 --> 00:47.982
Sorry.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.167
Somebody looks tired.

00:50.645 --> 00:52.016
Somebody wants to get home and into bed.

00:52.806 --> 00:54.822
You've got a rear taillight that's nonfunctional.

00:55.606 --> 00:57.654
I'm going to look the other way this time, 'cause it appears to me

00:57.689 --> 00:59.937
like you got some urgent business in the back seat.

01:01.580 --> 01:02.559
Thank you, Officer.

01:02.947 --> 01:05.413
But I'm gonna need some assurance you'll take care of this first thing tomorrow.

01:05.820 --> 01:06.803
Absolutely.

01:07.253 --> 01:08.426
You have my word, Officer.

01:08.616 --> 01:10.969
All right. Let's get this little lady back home and into bed.

01:11.406 --> 01:12.936
She can barely keep her eyes open.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074

02:14.532 --> 02:15.319
Are you all right?

02:19.364 --> 02:21.585
Do you need anything? I'll get you some water.

02:22.523 --> 02:23.418
No. I'm all right.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.244
God. I hope you're not getting sick again.

02:27.741 --> 02:29.921
Not with my mother coming to visit.

02:31.816 --> 02:32.578
Please.

02:32.926 --> 02:36.459
One nightmare a night is plenty, thanks.

03:23.923 --> 03:24.691
Ham?

03:25.327 --> 03:26.760
Ham. Hmm.

03:27.910 --> 03:30.047
Okay. I know what that means. That's your "no" voice.

03:30.118 --> 03:34.092
Well, no. It's not "no". I just don't think my mother is really a ham person.

03:34.321 --> 03:36.160
More of a veal person.

03:36.969 --> 03:38.464
A fish person, actually.

03:38.567 --> 03:39.283
Fish?

03:39.610 --> 03:42.329
Well, I don't know what to tell you. We don't really have veal kids.

03:42.408 --> 03:43.645
We don't have fish kids.

03:43.803 --> 03:47.331
We have ham kids. We have chicken finger kids.

03:47.404 --> 03:49.692
Maybe we could make some fish and some chicken fingers.

03:50.710 --> 03:52.513
- Forget I said that.
- I will.

03:57.998 --> 04:00.199
Honey, what are you doing?

04:00.276 --> 04:01.448
I'm building a fort.

04:01.591 --> 04:04.550
It's where I'm gonna sleep so Grandma can have my bed.

04:04.622 --> 04:06.726
What's the matter? Couch not good enough for you anymore?

04:06.824 --> 04:08.109
This is better.

04:09.599 --> 04:10.577
I don't know.

04:10.785 --> 04:12.721
We may want to have a nice dinner in there,

04:12.829 --> 04:14.239
it being the dining room and all.

04:14.402 --> 04:15.277
Please?

04:15.378 --> 04:17.438
Come on. When's the last time we used the dining room?

04:17.514 --> 04:18.375
Yay!

04:21.000 --> 04:22.276
Veal... fish...

04:23.612 --> 04:25.620
This week is going to kill me.

04:27.156 --> 04:28.226
Tell me about it.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.546
You can't do that.

04:29.634 --> 04:30.621
Sure, I can.

04:30.914 --> 04:33.279
You're my daughter-in-law. You're married to my son.

04:33.365 --> 04:34.958
It's not like you're naked or anything.

04:35.143 --> 04:36.987
- Besides, we need to talk.
- No, we don't.

04:37.048 --> 04:40.110
I have to go to work. I have to take a shower. And you're dead. Now, go away!

04:40.211 --> 04:43.436
Relax. Take it from someone who's been there before.

04:43.707 --> 04:46.595
Take it from someone who's seen their life flash before their eyes.

04:46.674 --> 04:49.076
There's nothing as important as family.

04:49.146 --> 04:50.467
What are you talking about?

04:50.565 --> 04:52.951
You were a workaholic father who ignored his son.

04:53.028 --> 04:54.665
You left your wife for another woman.

04:54.747 --> 04:57.813
And the whole time you were alive, you never once visited your grandchildren.

04:57.881 --> 04:58.746
Yeah? So?

04:59.350 --> 05:01.020
It's never too late to change.

05:01.106 --> 05:02.644
Oh... Out!

05:03.528 --> 05:04.092
Out!

05:05.719 --> 05:06.631
Excuse me?

05:08.044 --> 05:08.854
You all right?

05:12.006 --> 05:14.716
I don't know. I'll let you know a week from now.

05:16.599 --> 05:19.210
I don't know how familiar this office is with Project Defender,

05:19.267 --> 05:21.940
but through the use of modern DNA examination,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.965
and the implementation of other cutting-edge crime assessment tools,

05:26.031 --> 05:28.135
we've been responsible for the freeing of many prisoners

05:28.186 --> 05:30.827
erroneously sentenced to long-term incarceration

05:30.894 --> 05:32.574
and, in some cases, even death.

05:32.867 --> 05:35.600
I'm very familiar with your work. What is it that brings you to Phoenix?

05:35.687 --> 05:38.846
Beginning last year, the project received a series of letters

05:38.918 --> 05:42.564
from an inmate at the Springville Correctional Institute claiming wrongful conviction.

05:42.650 --> 05:44.667
Are  you familiar with a Mr. Owen Butler?

05:44.929 --> 05:45.938
He's currently serving...

05:46.015 --> 05:48.923
A life sentence for the murder of Clancy Donovan in 1995.

05:48.994 --> 05:51.943
I'm well aware of the case. I prosecuted it myself.

05:51.999 --> 05:52.942
Now, please don't misunderstand.

05:52.999 --> 05:55.824
We're not necessarily alleging prosecutorial misconduct here.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.652
No. Of course not.

05:58.051 --> 06:00.391
You suspect I made an honest mistake.

06:01.886 --> 06:04.406
On the record, the Mayor's office would like you both to know

06:04.461 --> 06:06.241
that he supports the work of your project,

06:06.292 --> 06:08.174
and he's happy to do anything he can to help.

06:09.650 --> 06:11.907
Please let His Honor know that we appreciate that.

06:12.096 --> 06:15.009
Well, now that it's clear that we're all friends...

06:15.434 --> 06:17.733
I'm all for exonerating the innocent,

06:17.907 --> 06:21.061
but when it comes to Owen Butler, I'm afraid you're barking up the wrong tree.

06:21.133 --> 06:21.973
Are we?

06:22.136 --> 06:25.188
Court transcript shows you were never able to establish any real connection

06:25.239 --> 06:26.692
between Mr. Butler and the victim.

06:26.774 --> 06:27.773
I beg to differ.

06:28.173 --> 06:30.579
Both men in question were illegal drug users.

06:30.655 --> 06:32.479
It seemed quite clear to both the judge and the jury

06:32.540 --> 06:35.193
that Mr. Butler broke into that apartment looking for drugs.

06:35.243 --> 06:36.324
No. I beg to differ.

06:36.401 --> 06:39.042
You had no witnesses to place him near the crime scene.

06:39.114 --> 06:39.811
True.

06:40.051 --> 06:42.601
But, as I recall, he couldn't account for his whereabouts

06:42.658 --> 06:44.371
at the time of the shooting either.

06:44.474 --> 06:47.786
I mean, it's not as if his alibi didn't check out. He simply had none.

06:47.843 --> 06:50.526
The man was so incapacitated by his drug habit

06:50.588 --> 06:53.021
he had no idea where he was an hour before being questioned,

06:53.075 --> 06:54.572
much less at the time of the shooting.

06:54.633 --> 06:57.363
Be that as it may, there's still no forensic evidence

06:57.412 --> 07:01.575
to  indicate he was ever in that apartment-- no fingerprints, no DNA evidence-- nothing.

07:01.638 --> 07:05.702
Yes, I know. Nothing except a .38 caliber slug that passed through Mr. Donovan's skull

07:05.743 --> 07:10.117
and embedded itself in the wall of his apartment-- a .38 caliber slug

07:10.168 --> 07:13.336
that matched the gun that we found in the trunk of Butler's car.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.160
True.

07:15.390 --> 07:17.822
It still doesn't prove he was the one that pulled the trigger.

07:18.093 --> 07:18.985
I'm sorry.

07:19.450 --> 07:23.807
I prosecuted this case almost ten years ago, and a jury of 12 citizens found Mr. Butler guilty.

07:23.879 --> 07:27.867
Now, if you've uncovered some evidence that shows somehow we got it wrong,

07:27.969 --> 07:29.393
I'm happy to hear it.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.532
If not, I need to get on with my day.

07:36.043 --> 07:37.674
Mr. District Attorney?

07:38.241 --> 07:39.786
They're on a fishing expedition.

07:39.905 --> 07:41.619
Fine. Then let's let them fish.

07:41.681 --> 07:43.950
Just so they don't go to the press and claim we're stonewalling.

07:44.026 --> 07:46.479
I mean, as long as you're completely confident the case against Butler

07:46.541 --> 07:48.486
is going to hold up, this shouldn't be a problem.

07:48.552 --> 07:49.278
You're right.

07:49.591 --> 07:50.570
There is no problem.

07:50.958 --> 07:51.706
Excellent.

07:52.136 --> 07:53.912
And I'll be sure and share that with the Mayor.

07:58.951 --> 08:04.168
Butler lost his job as a landscaper back in 93 when he was picked up for indecent exposure.

08:04.470 --> 08:07.701
Took to petty theft to finance a worsening drug habit.

08:07.762 --> 08:11.951
Ended up shooting a man execution-style during a bungled robbery.

08:12.130 --> 08:14.464
He's ten years into a life sentence at Springville.

08:14.693 --> 08:16.489
Sounds pretty open and shut.

08:16.564 --> 08:17.373
It was.

08:18.693 --> 08:22.790
And why they're choosing to reopen this particular can of worms right now is beyond me,

08:22.852 --> 08:26.738
but I need someone to interface between their group and ours,

08:27.085 --> 08:28.591
and I'm a little shorthanded.

08:29.241 --> 08:32.937
Wait a second. It doesn't sound like something I'm particularly well-suited for.

08:33.224 --> 08:35.155
Frankly, it sounds like something for a lawyer.

08:35.332 --> 08:36.318
I'm confused.

08:36.865 --> 08:38.304
Didn't you study to be a lawyer?

08:41.535 --> 08:42.967
Welcome back to Phoenix, Ma.

08:45.290 --> 08:46.807
Happy Mother's Day.

08:46.905 --> 08:48.974
Well, happy week leading up to Mother's Day.

08:49.060 --> 08:52.635
Yes. Well, happy week leading up to Mother's Day to you, too.

08:52.808 --> 08:54.437
For what it's worth, you're looking good.

08:54.646 --> 08:56.096
Oh, you're sweet to say that.

08:57.242 --> 09:01.569
Truth is, I had a long winter, and I didn't get out as much as I would've liked.

09:01.748 --> 09:03.341
Mother, what are you talking about? What about the cruise?

09:03.411 --> 09:04.386
Oh, no. You're right.

09:04.498 --> 09:06.064
You're right. The cruise was nice.

09:06.441 --> 09:08.419
I mean, if you like that sort of thing.

09:08.497 --> 09:09.546
You don't like that sort of thing?

09:09.613 --> 09:11.569
No, no. I liked it.

09:12.224 --> 09:13.182
It was nice.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.167
You get on a big boat.

09:15.664 --> 09:17.129
- You sail around.
- Right.

09:17.247 --> 09:19.084
You come back to the place where you started.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.276
I don't know.

09:21.363 --> 09:25.136
In retrospect, I'm not sure I accomplished all that much.

09:30.031 --> 09:32.562
So, is Ariel any taller?

09:32.657 --> 09:34.025
Does Marie talk yet?

09:34.326 --> 09:36.227
Has Bridgette learned to brush her own hair?

09:36.342 --> 09:37.773
You got way too many questions, Ma.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.784
I'm gonna have to book you a later return ticket.

09:42.830 --> 09:44.074
I've never seen him before.

09:44.248 --> 09:45.289
Why would I kill him?

09:45.929 --> 09:47.967
Maybe you knew he kept drugs in the apartment.

09:48.187 --> 09:49.570
How would I know that?

09:50.295 --> 09:51.991
You've never done business together?

09:52.071 --> 09:53.368
You've never bought from him?

09:53.450 --> 09:54.352
No. Never.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.961
Mr. Butler, you can't tell me where you ate lunch today,

09:58.028 --> 10:00.358
but you're certain you've never seen this man before.

10:00.599 --> 10:03.476
If I could have a taste, I'd remember a little better.

10:04.382 --> 10:05.160
Ms. Dubois?

10:05.816 --> 10:06.521
Sorry.

10:07.277 --> 10:09.349
Gary Craig, Project Defender.

10:09.867 --> 10:13.823
This is Deborah. She's a student at ASU, and one of the interns down at the project.

10:13.874 --> 10:14.826
Nice to meet you both.

10:15.200 --> 10:18.456
District Attorney Devalos asked me to sit in on any interviews,

10:18.545 --> 10:20.530
and to help in any way I can.

10:20.669 --> 10:24.626
Much  appreciated. The less adversarial we can make this whole process, the better.

10:24.693 --> 10:26.240
I have a question, though. This man...

10:26.285 --> 10:27.730
Have you looked at his rap sheet?

10:27.974 --> 10:31.599
He's no angel. Are you sure this is someone whose innocence you want to champion?

10:31.677 --> 10:33.014
I'm sorry. I don't see it that way.

10:33.413 --> 10:35.844
It's not for me to judge someone's worth.

10:36.044 --> 10:40.247
The question on the table is, is he guilty of the crime for which he was tried and convicted?

10:40.323 --> 10:43.611
Our purpose is to serve as an extra check and balance to make sure

10:43.651 --> 10:47.206
that  the system works at its most evenhanded and fair-minded.

10:47.806 --> 10:51.774
These are copies of all the correspondence we received from the accused and his prior counsel.

10:51.881 --> 10:52.576
Thank you.

11:06.912 --> 11:07.532
Mr. Butler.

11:17.022 --> 11:17.989
How you doing?

11:23.466 --> 11:25.171
Ew! It smells like fish in here.

11:25.307 --> 11:26.206
It's salmon.

11:26.504 --> 11:29.759
Marjorie, um... how much tonic should I put in your gin?

11:29.840 --> 11:32.088
Oh, just the tiniest of tiny splashes, darling.

11:32.268 --> 11:33.803
In fact, don't even bother.

11:35.749 --> 11:36.594
What's this?

11:36.849 --> 11:37.720
Napkin.

11:39.203 --> 11:42.447
Sorry, Mom. I was at the store, I had it on my list and everything.

11:49.374 --> 11:50.990
You want a chicken finger, Grandma?

11:51.125 --> 11:53.353
Mmm! Didn't know chickens had fingers.

11:53.439 --> 11:57.448
Bridgette, Bridgette, thank you for sharing, but... let Grandma eat her own food.

11:57.909 --> 12:01.446
So, Allison, tell me about your work.

12:02.051 --> 12:03.623
Oh, I don't know, it's part time.

12:03.699 --> 12:05.056
I work for the District Attorney.

12:05.221 --> 12:06.705
Sort of a paralegal thing?

12:06.859 --> 12:08.518
Well, there's definitely some "para..."

12:09.547 --> 12:11.747
and I do believe there's some "legal" in there, too, so...

12:11.823 --> 12:13.629
Oh, I... I do a lot of different things.

12:14.380 --> 12:17.206
It must be quite a balancing act with the house and the kids.

12:17.349 --> 12:20.042
I don't know. It seems to work out for the most part.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.962
I'm kind of on-call, so it depends what's happening...

12:22.025 --> 12:23.110
That's so nice.

12:23.519 --> 12:26.330
And I guess the extra income comes in handy, too, hmm?

12:26.504 --> 12:28.097
Maybe you can finally get some help.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.736
What kind of help, Grandma?

12:29.843 --> 12:34.129
Oh, you know, some nice lady who could straighten up and make the beds...

12:34.569 --> 12:36.857
make sure there's napkins.

12:38.767 --> 12:39.504
Mom...

12:40.934 --> 12:42.182
- What?
- Would you excuse me?

12:50.697 --> 12:52.166
It's not what you think.

12:52.775 --> 12:54.085
What are you talking about?

12:54.219 --> 12:56.595
She's a witch. She's a smiling cobra, she's...

12:56.682 --> 12:57.645
Lonely.

12:58.719 --> 13:02.293
Everything else you said, too, but mostly she's lonely.

13:03.322 --> 13:04.787
She wants to move here.

13:05.497 --> 13:06.573
She wants to live here.

13:06.968 --> 13:08.376
She wants to be the help.

13:09.676 --> 13:11.447
That's what I was trying to tell you before.

13:15.610 --> 13:16.507
You sure?

13:17.290 --> 13:18.016
Yeah.

13:18.652 --> 13:20.654
This is something you picked up from her?

13:23.115 --> 13:24.029
No.

13:32.215 --> 13:34.657
Okay, look, I told you I can't handle that.

13:34.745 --> 13:36.740
- I don't know, it's just... it's...
- I'm sorry.

13:36.826 --> 13:39.937
I mean, most people lose their parents and they lose them.

13:40.053 --> 13:44.165
Okay, let's not focus on the messenger, let's just focus on the message.

13:52.008 --> 13:53.930
Okay, look, she's my mother.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.780
The thing is, she's not your mother.

13:58.262 --> 13:59.495
So how do you feel?

14:00.703 --> 14:03.530
Me? I was just hoping to live through Mother's Day.

14:04.682 --> 14:06.391
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

14:07.938 --> 14:10.032
Maybe I should have kept it to myself.

14:11.782 --> 14:14.655
I  mean, there's nothing to do until she says something, right?

14:15.013 --> 14:15.859
True.

14:16.662 --> 14:18.996
I mean, who knows? Maybe my dad's off base on this.

14:19.730 --> 14:22.875
I mean, if he was so good at reading my mother, then how come they get divorced?

14:23.549 --> 14:25.372
God, it's never boring around here.

14:34.097 --> 14:37.385
My partner and I had just knocked off. We were heading out to a bar to catch a game.

14:37.450 --> 14:41.065
I remember because the Suns were in the playoffs against the Rockets.

14:41.239 --> 14:45.135
Anyway, a uniformed patrolman responded to a shots-fired call,

14:45.233 --> 14:46.636
discovered a dead body.

14:47.429 --> 14:51.736
Actually, um... the victim may have still been alive when the uniform arrived on the scene.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.063
I-I don't recall.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.625
We were nearby, so they had us take the call.

14:57.669 --> 15:00.260
In any event, when my partner and I arrived

15:00.828 --> 15:04.228
the uniform showed us the apartment had been broken in through a back window.

15:04.309 --> 15:05.790
And at that point anyway,

15:06.384 --> 15:10.556
Mr. Donovan, the victim, was dead from a single gunshot wound to the head.

15:11.104 --> 15:14.724
The bullet was from a weapon we later found in Mr. Butler's possession.

15:15.077 --> 15:18.177
And how did you come to find the gun in Butler's car?

15:18.329 --> 15:21.069
An anonymous caller phoned it in, I believe.

15:21.233 --> 15:24.370
Said he'd overheard Butler bragging about the crime.

15:24.637 --> 15:27.207
We got a search warrant, went to Butler's apartment.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.839
Neighbor said he hadn't been home for days.

15:30.018 --> 15:31.293
Was that unusual?

15:31.631 --> 15:36.254
Apparently not. She said he sometimes went on week-long crack binges.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.199
When we finally caught up to Butler,

15:38.327 --> 15:40.474
we found the gun in the trunk of his car.

15:41.076 --> 15:44.190
Forensics matched it with the bullet that killed Donovan.

15:44.466 --> 15:45.941
It should all be there in the record.

15:46.064 --> 15:50.259
Detective Rickey, how thoroughly did you examine that apartment for evidence?

15:50.738 --> 15:52.818
I don't know, I think we were there a day and a half.

15:52.904 --> 15:57.840
In all that time you didn't find one fingerprint belonging to the accused?

15:58.108 --> 16:00.979
I mean... if the man was there to steal drugs,

16:01.056 --> 16:05.162
presumably he would've left some prints in and around the drugs.

16:05.233 --> 16:06.304
Doesn't that make sense?

16:06.815 --> 16:08.104
He was wearing gloves.

16:09.196 --> 16:10.354
He brought the gun.

16:10.794 --> 16:12.417
He knew what he was going to do.

16:12.847 --> 16:15.650
Why would he go out of his way to leave prints for us?

16:15.755 --> 16:19.421
He didn't go out of his way to leave fiber evidence for you either, according to your report.

16:19.591 --> 16:22.882
He also left no eyewitnesses to place him at the scene of the crime

16:22.934 --> 16:25.059
and no DNA to prove he was there.

16:25.202 --> 16:28.678
It's a pretty well thought-out crime for a crack-addicted petty thief, wouldn't you say?

16:31.617 --> 16:33.076
Thank you for coming in, Detective.

16:35.591 --> 16:38.048
Next witness, 10:30. Why don't we take a few minutes?

16:38.140 --> 16:40.622
Hi, honey, it's me. I tried to call your mom on her cell phone

16:40.682 --> 16:42.544
to see how she and Marie were doing.

16:42.861 --> 16:44.474
Just went straight to voice mail.

16:44.965 --> 16:46.419
Anyway, I'm on break.

16:46.675 --> 16:47.587
Give me a call.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.426
I love you.

16:48.606 --> 16:49.231
Bye.

16:50.990 --> 16:51.862
Detective...

16:52.058 --> 16:53.295
I thought I might see you here.

16:53.828 --> 16:56.265
Which way to the Project Pretender fiasco?

16:56.387 --> 16:57.325
Be nice.

16:57.494 --> 17:00.009
Wait a second, I didn't know you were a part of all this.

17:00.285 --> 17:03.813
I don't remember seeing "Detective Lee Scanlon" on any of the reports.

17:03.884 --> 17:05.455
Well, we're talking ten years ago.

17:05.712 --> 17:08.532
I was Patrolman Leland Scanlon if you please.

17:09.034 --> 17:12.310
And I was the responding uniformed officer the night Donovan was murdered.

17:12.387 --> 17:14.574
Oh, my God, I am so glad to see you.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.826
Why, you tired of making small talk with the bleeding hearts?

17:17.108 --> 17:20.084
Well, actually, these people are presenting a very compelling argument.

17:20.221 --> 17:22.588
The case against Butler isn't terribly strong.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.096
I hate to see him get out of jail because of it.

17:25.167 --> 17:27.882
I'd really hate to see what it would do to District Attorney Devalos.

17:28.204 --> 17:29.069
Allison...

17:29.535 --> 17:32.920
trust me, those people will never get this guy off.

17:35.326 --> 17:38.506
Neighbors heard the gunshot in Donovan's apartment, called 911.

17:39.033 --> 17:43.456
I got to the door, no one answered. The door was locked, so I forced it open.

17:44.906 --> 17:48.561
I walked into what I guess you would call the main room, the living room.

17:49.241 --> 17:50.978
The body was on the floor...

17:51.408 --> 17:54.675
although I was not immediately certain that the victim had expired.

17:54.905 --> 17:57.449
There were drugs and paraphernalia everywhere.

17:58.176 --> 18:01.816
Wasn't for all the blood, you'd have thought he got high watching the game and passed out or something.

18:02.743 --> 18:03.921
Then I looked up.

18:05.047 --> 18:07.311
I saw some guy on the fire escape.

18:07.506 --> 18:08.939
Couldn't tell you who he was.

18:09.318 --> 18:11.714
He  took off like a bat out of hell.

18:12.354 --> 18:15.401
I guess he'd been up there the whole time, hoping and praying I wouldn't notice him.

18:16.410 --> 18:18.632
Soon as our eyes locked, he took off.

18:19.184 --> 18:21.059
And you didn't give chase?

18:22.021 --> 18:25.528
I felt like the thing to do was to attempt to revive the victim.

18:28.273 --> 18:32.512
I did mouth-to-mouth and CPR for, uh, I don't know, maybe seven, eight minutes.

18:36.726 --> 18:40.049
Anything catch your eye after that point?

18:40.203 --> 18:42.244
The window showed signs of forced entry.

18:42.407 --> 18:46.106
I fired we were looking at, uh... a possible robbery attempt.

18:46.541 --> 18:49.818
The truth was, I was in way over my head.

18:50.684 --> 18:53.173
I realized that the victim had expired,

18:53.515 --> 18:56.785
there was nothing for me to do except call it in, wait for the detectives.

18:59.331 --> 19:00.452
You getting all that?

19:01.859 --> 19:03.359
Oh, yeah, I got it.

19:10.306 --> 19:12.505
Hey, everybody. Sorry I'm late.

19:12.838 --> 19:16.492
I didn't know what everybody wanted, so I picked up a couple of pizzas.

19:17.501 --> 19:19.750
Don't worry, Mom. I got you a salad thing.

19:19.841 --> 19:20.558
Hey, babe.

19:21.188 --> 19:22.275
Look what Mom did.

19:24.152 --> 19:26.216
She cut up the vegetables herself.

19:26.887 --> 19:28.429
It's a crabmeat bisque.

19:30.107 --> 19:32.376
Oh, boy. What a treat.

19:33.068 --> 19:34.469
This is so nice.

19:34.864 --> 19:36.363
Excuse me a second.

19:39.082 --> 19:39.861
Wow!

19:40.833 --> 19:42.011
It's clean in here.

19:46.708 --> 19:47.740
Oh, my gosh.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.573
Dinner in the dining room?

19:50.787 --> 19:52.927
Bridge, what happened to your fort?

19:53.148 --> 19:55.031
Grandma bought a magic bed.

19:55.467 --> 19:58.698
I picked up one of those inflatable beds that plug into the wall.

19:58.991 --> 20:00.863
That way she can have her bed back,

20:00.950 --> 20:02.815
and you can have your dining room back.

20:03.075 --> 20:05.452
Oh, my gosh. Why didn't I think of that?

20:06.050 --> 20:09.015
How...? When-when did you do all this?

20:09.209 --> 20:12.420
Well, by the time I got the baby down for her nap

20:12.472 --> 20:15.856
and the girls and I got their homework out of the way, it just...

20:15.968 --> 20:17.566
I don't know. It just sort of worked out.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.781
I helped Grandma polish the silver.

20:20.069 --> 20:22.020
And she taught me how to brush my hair.

20:22.117 --> 20:23.377
But not at the table, honey.

20:25.706 --> 20:28.425
Is-is it okay? Is... it's not too hot?

20:36.542 --> 20:37.789
It's delicious.

20:42.767 --> 20:44.567
It's the noise, I think.

20:47.655 --> 20:49.971
That's why we take cruises and...

20:50.769 --> 20:54.112
walk through the malls and sleep with the television on.

20:56.426 --> 20:57.640
It's the noise.

20:59.529 --> 21:00.549
Kids...

21:01.660 --> 21:02.853
husbands...

21:05.330 --> 21:06.734
You get used to it.

21:07.588 --> 21:08.833
And then one day...

21:10.334 --> 21:11.184
it's gone.

21:14.972 --> 21:16.165
Your daughters...

21:18.003 --> 21:20.226
are lovely people, you two.

21:23.512 --> 21:25.176
They make a lovely noise.

21:28.270 --> 21:29.226
Oh, dear.

21:31.059 --> 21:32.893
Someone's had enough wine...

21:37.827 --> 21:39.860
Time to sleep in my magic bed.

21:44.522 --> 21:45.385
Night, Ma.

21:46.992 --> 21:48.024
Sleep tight.

22:04.454 --> 22:06.516
Did she actually say anything to you?

22:06.699 --> 22:08.942
Uh, no. But while she was cooking,

22:09.100 --> 22:11.973
I noticed she had the newspaper open to the Real Estate section.

22:14.744 --> 22:16.325
Okay. I'll ask.

22:17.541 --> 22:19.290
Would it be such a horrible thing?

22:23.079 --> 22:26.396
Today is not the day to ask me that.

22:27.328 --> 22:28.394
Well, what do you mean?

22:29.612 --> 22:32.048
I don't think I'm ready to discuss that yet.

22:33.242 --> 22:36.574
But I strongly suspect that I will always remember today

22:36.637 --> 22:39.858
as the day where little Allison discovered there was no Santa Claus.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.738
'Cause people really aren't good.

22:44.986 --> 22:47.276
And justice isn't only blind...

22:49.104 --> 22:50.199
it's in a coma.

22:52.196 --> 22:52.964
Okay.

23:13.133 --> 23:16.093
Hey, Billy, it's definitely a party out here in front of the arena,

23:16.158 --> 23:21.298
where fans have already started to gather in expectation of a victory celebration.

23:21.457 --> 23:25.609
That's if their home team can hold onto an enormous lead.

23:32.624 --> 23:35.004
Thank you for agreeing to see me without counsel.

23:37.206 --> 23:38.482
I'm in here forever.

23:38.804 --> 23:40.108
How much worse can it get?

23:43.376 --> 23:45.373
On the night in question, are you absolutely certain

23:45.440 --> 23:47.614
you have no recollection of where you were?

23:47.825 --> 23:49.336
Where would you like me to have been?

23:50.391 --> 23:52.014
My public defender told me...

23:52.239 --> 23:55.542
he said, "Owen, all we got's the truth.

23:56.038 --> 23:58.030
And the truth is, you don't know where you were.

23:58.615 --> 24:02.689
Make something up, and they won't even bother to prove you shot this guy.

24:04.056 --> 24:05.966
They'll just prove you're a liar."

24:11.654 --> 24:13.268
Do you like basketball?

24:15.156 --> 24:16.109
What do you mean?

24:17.298 --> 24:18.399
Like what? Playing?

24:18.577 --> 24:21.344
No. I-I mean... watching it.

24:21.879 --> 24:23.647
Do you ever go to a game, or...?

24:25.367 --> 24:26.897
Maybe TV sometimes.

24:29.235 --> 24:30.625
I-I don't... I don't know.

24:30.748 --> 24:31.941
But you never actually go?

24:32.401 --> 24:33.697
To the arena, I mean?

24:34.525 --> 24:36.042
Oh, yeah. 'Course I do.

24:36.666 --> 24:39.888
I sit up in the skybox with my pipe. And I fire that bitch up and...

24:40.193 --> 24:42.410
get so high that I can dunk from my seat.

24:42.821 --> 24:44.110
What are you burning, lady?

24:44.311 --> 24:45.899
You know how much it costs to get in there?

24:46.645 --> 24:47.859
I'm sorry, I...

24:50.025 --> 24:52.317
I did work the parking lot sometimes, though.

24:53.977 --> 24:56.559
You get those happy white boys with their season tickets

24:56.629 --> 24:59.317
and SUVs at the home games,

24:59.666 --> 25:00.853
tailgating it...

25:01.063 --> 25:02.706
coming in and out of the stadium...

25:03.862 --> 25:06.000
They'd be happy to give you a five or ten dollars

25:06.055 --> 25:08.339
just so you won't get too close to their cars.

25:10.019 --> 25:11.134
The parking lot?

25:11.812 --> 25:13.459
Right outside the stadium?

25:13.967 --> 25:15.046
Yeah, outside.

25:15.819 --> 25:17.023
Course, outside.

25:18.031 --> 25:18.835
Thank you.

25:31.445 --> 25:32.705
Let me ask you a question.

25:33.623 --> 25:36.847
Is it completely hypocritical of me to be scared to death

25:36.905 --> 25:39.529
of the possibility of your mother living near us...

25:39.857 --> 25:43.296
while at the same time calling you at work to say do you think it would be okay

25:43.378 --> 25:45.735
if I left her with the kids for a little while...

25:46.031 --> 25:48.489
while I go and meet with somebody in about a half an hour?

25:48.623 --> 25:50.538
Yes, it's completely hypocritical,

25:50.646 --> 25:51.874
and I think you should do it.

26:05.064 --> 26:05.734
Hey.

26:07.623 --> 26:08.294
Hey.

26:12.478 --> 26:14.280
It's 9:30. I'm missing The Bachelorette.

26:16.220 --> 26:18.238
What's so important it couldn't hold till tomorrow?

26:18.334 --> 26:21.989
How far would you say the University of Arizona is from Clancy Donovan's apartment?

26:22.030 --> 26:23.138
Time-wise, I mean?

26:23.398 --> 26:24.710
40, 45 minutes.

26:24.812 --> 26:26.409
More on game night, I suppose. Why?

26:28.883 --> 26:30.229
I found this videotape.

26:30.433 --> 26:32.196
The Rockets against the Suns.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.637
'95 playoffs, the night of May 11.

26:36.490 --> 26:37.243
Okay.

26:37.575 --> 26:40.447
During the broadcast of the game, around 9:30 p.m.,

26:40.541 --> 26:42.363
they show the crowd outside the stadium.

26:43.397 --> 26:45.240
Owen Butler is in that crowd.

26:46.413 --> 26:49.019
Lee... he couldn't have been at Clancy Donovan's apartment.

26:49.086 --> 26:50.847
He couldn't have been anywhere near there.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.868
Okay. You say so.

26:54.564 --> 26:55.799
I don't know what to tell you.

26:56.285 --> 26:58.123
I never said I could ID him on that fire escape.

26:58.189 --> 27:00.796
I mean, it's really the gun that put him away.

27:01.272 --> 27:02.822
I didn't have anything to do with that.

27:03.757 --> 27:05.308
The man is innocent, Lee.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.016
Innocent?

27:07.835 --> 27:08.675
Really?

27:11.230 --> 27:14.198
Sorry, "innocent" is the last thing Owen Butler is.

27:15.270 --> 27:18.787
Did he kill a small-time drug dealer named Clancy Donovan?

27:18.885 --> 27:19.586
Maybe...

27:20.487 --> 27:21.275
maybe not.

27:21.721 --> 27:22.570
But innocent?

27:23.222 --> 27:24.332
I beg to differ.

27:25.515 --> 27:27.352
I know what he is.

27:27.644 --> 27:29.703
I know what he is capable of.

27:29.943 --> 27:32.053
But that's not the way the system works.

27:32.852 --> 27:33.893
Don't lecture me.

27:41.735 --> 27:45.687
So, you can prove that Owen Butler was at the Suns game on May 11, 1995.

27:45.883 --> 27:47.013
That's cool, Allison.

27:48.314 --> 27:49.211
That's great.

27:51.930 --> 27:54.904
Now do you think you can tell me where Samantha Robinson might have been that night?

27:55.037 --> 27:56.333
Whatever was left of her?

27:57.454 --> 27:58.883
What hole he stuck her in?

27:59.072 --> 28:01.616
What garbage dump? What meat grinder he ran her through?

28:01.692 --> 28:04.860
What tree chipper he fed her four-year-old body into?

28:06.157 --> 28:07.550
Was she the little girl?

28:08.533 --> 28:10.044
In the back seat of the car?

28:13.049 --> 28:14.141
You were the cop.

28:14.697 --> 28:16.091
You pulled them over.

28:17.104 --> 28:19.233
You saw her in the back seat.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.865
He said they were coming home from the circus.

28:24.702 --> 28:25.777
I believed him...

28:26.994 --> 28:28.655
and I wished him a good night.

28:31.696 --> 28:34.148
About an hour and a half later, she was reported missing.

28:34.497 --> 28:37.078
Her mother had gone upstairs to check on her. The window was open.

28:39.903 --> 28:42.090
I didn't know anything till the next day at roll call.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.758
They passed around her picture.

28:47.287 --> 28:48.490
I actually measured.

28:50.186 --> 28:53.564
When I was leaning in his car window, I was two and a half feet away from her.

28:54.552 --> 28:55.729
I'm so sorry.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.649
I gave them the plate number.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.021
Turned out the car was stolen.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.212
We didn't even have a name on the guy.

29:02.278 --> 29:03.753
They put me with a sketch artist.

29:06.049 --> 29:07.829
The whole state was on alert

29:08.808 --> 29:09.699
for days...

29:10.440 --> 29:11.044
but...

29:16.855 --> 29:19.568
Visited her folks a couple of times. Did what I could to keep the case alive.

29:19.630 --> 29:21.576
But I was a patrolman, a beat cop.

29:23.118 --> 29:25.043
A year went by, 18 months.

29:25.248 --> 29:26.215
Never found the girl.

29:26.303 --> 29:27.362
Never found the body.

29:30.715 --> 29:33.091
Then one day, I'm walking by this Laundromat...

29:35.221 --> 29:38.046
He was trying to jimmy open a change machine with a screwdriver.

29:39.687 --> 29:40.654
And I thought...

29:41.908 --> 29:43.086
"Don't blow this.

29:43.900 --> 29:45.799
Don't blow this hauling him in for petty theft.

29:45.856 --> 29:47.925
He'll just get out in two days, and you'll never see him again."

29:49.865 --> 29:51.605
And I started following him around.

29:53.868 --> 29:55.328
Learning everything about him.

29:57.001 --> 29:58.696
Waiting for him to do something.

29:59.187 --> 29:59.984
Anything.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.256
Then, one day...

30:07.984 --> 30:09.684
I answered a shots-fired call.

30:12.274 --> 30:14.829
Guy had blown his own head off. I was the first one there.

30:15.905 --> 30:16.980
It was a gift.

30:17.569 --> 30:18.619
It was Providence.

30:19.136 --> 30:21.128
So, you put the gun in his car.

30:21.594 --> 30:24.655
Then you made an anonymous tip, to be sure they'd find it.

30:26.498 --> 30:28.020
And I'd do it again.

30:30.603 --> 30:31.839
And you know what?

30:33.503 --> 30:34.507
So would you.

30:36.067 --> 30:36.749
Yeah.

30:37.287 --> 30:39.192
You're not the only mind reader in the room.

30:44.070 --> 30:46.216
So, do whatever you have to do with your tape.

30:47.061 --> 30:48.156
Do what you can live with.

30:51.253 --> 30:52.058
Me?

30:53.645 --> 30:55.115
I'm sleeping just fine.

31:39.922 --> 31:41.563
Place looks decent enough.

31:42.623 --> 31:44.170
No thanks to you, I'm sure.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.243
I can't do this right now.

31:46.397 --> 31:48.455
Well, you're going to have to deal with it soon.

31:48.992 --> 31:52.045
You've botched this thing so badly.

31:52.356 --> 31:54.307
She actually thinks that you need her here.

31:54.513 --> 31:55.306
Excuse me?

31:55.613 --> 31:56.867
Why? What'd you do?

31:57.083 --> 31:58.269
I don't smell anything.

31:58.940 --> 32:01.655
No, I mean... what have I botched?

32:01.728 --> 32:04.106
Well, let's start with everything.

32:04.455 --> 32:07.061
The whole reason that I gave you that heads-up

32:07.123 --> 32:09.488
was so that you could nip this thing in the bud.

32:09.672 --> 32:14.495
Make it clear to her that her future it, it's not here, picking up after you.

32:15.193 --> 32:17.337
It's back home in Grosse Pointe.

32:17.629 --> 32:19.067
That's where she belongs.

32:20.216 --> 32:22.861
You're the one who told me that she was lonely.

32:25.857 --> 32:27.019
And she is.

32:28.755 --> 32:32.124
But that's because she hasn't met that clown yet.

32:33.695 --> 32:35.554
Wait a second. What clown?

32:35.733 --> 32:36.569
Merle.

32:37.187 --> 32:39.316
He is this guy at the club.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.554
Widower.

32:41.820 --> 32:42.559
Loaded.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.320
Got a terrific backhand.

32:45.410 --> 32:47.110
I'm sorry. I'm lost.

32:47.904 --> 32:50.393
Who is this guy? Is he a friend of yours? Or Marjorie's...?

32:50.487 --> 32:53.623
I told you. He's just a guy.

32:54.358 --> 32:56.885
He's had his eye on her for a while.

32:57.730 --> 32:59.471
She hasn't figured it out yet...

32:59.685 --> 33:00.622
she will.

33:01.589 --> 33:05.159
Look, deep down I'm not all that crazy about him.

33:05.204 --> 33:07.534
He's got some ideas about things I just...

33:08.025 --> 33:09.223
don't agree with.

33:10.909 --> 33:11.757
But...

33:14.519 --> 33:17.703
he's going to make her feel really great about herself...

33:18.604 --> 33:19.545
for a while,

33:21.117 --> 33:22.567
and she deserves that.

33:25.566 --> 33:29.182
And that's something that you can see from where you are?

33:30.159 --> 33:32.224
There's not much that you can't see.

33:33.935 --> 33:35.075
Allison?

33:35.556 --> 33:37.614
Oh, did you just get back?

33:43.893 --> 33:45.331
Who you talking to?

33:45.996 --> 33:47.645
Nobody. Just the TV.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.450
Are you hungry? I could heat something up.

33:51.286 --> 33:54.265
Oh, God, I was such an ass.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.433
No, I'm okay.

33:59.645 --> 34:01.372
Well, then I'm going to bed.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.310
Night.

34:08.908 --> 34:09.891
Night, Mom.

34:10.556 --> 34:11.406
Night, Mom.

34:14.201 --> 34:15.155
Night, honey.

34:25.728 --> 34:27.545
Whatcha lookin' at in the dark?

34:31.351 --> 34:32.163
Nothing.

34:35.056 --> 34:38.451
He said he knew I'd do the same thing if I was in his position.

34:40.059 --> 34:40.766
And...?

34:42.551 --> 34:43.902
And I think he's right.

34:46.550 --> 34:48.643
It's just, I'm not in his position.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.210
So what are you going to do?

34:51.933 --> 34:53.130
I already did it.

34:56.417 --> 34:59.126
I left the tape on Devalos's desk.

35:00.487 --> 35:01.927
Wait. I don't get it.

35:02.090 --> 35:03.472
I just left it there.

35:03.719 --> 35:04.651
No note.

35:05.004 --> 35:06.094
No explanation.

35:07.482 --> 35:11.050
I figured he doesn't need to know where it came from.

35:12.125 --> 35:15.372
As far as he's concerned, it just arrived there.

35:15.509 --> 35:16.498
Anonymously.

35:17.876 --> 35:21.258
It'll exonerate Butler, but I won't implicate Scanlon.

35:21.972 --> 35:25.267
Putting Butler out on the street is tragedy enough.

35:26.799 --> 35:30.373
Hurting a good man who did a bad thing

35:30.639 --> 35:33.093
for reasons I completely understand...

35:33.860 --> 35:35.913
I don't think I can be a part of that.

35:38.248 --> 35:38.981
Yeah.

36:11.630 --> 36:13.996
We went through his W-2s, saw that he worked here.

36:15.199 --> 36:16.278
You're sure you remember him?

36:16.397 --> 36:17.611
Oh, yeah, I remember him.

36:18.193 --> 36:20.708
Must've been about, uh... ten years ago.

36:20.785 --> 36:22.291
We were in the middle of re-sodding.

36:22.762 --> 36:25.777
He wasn't a bad worker at first, but then he started showing up late,

36:25.961 --> 36:27.743
wired on God knows what.

36:27.937 --> 36:29.382
Had to let him go eventually.

36:31.741 --> 36:33.435
What is she doing, anyway?

36:53.445 --> 36:54.557
She's right here.

37:00.937 --> 37:03.020
Samantha's right here.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.606
I'm grateful for Project Defender for believing in me.

37:09.512 --> 37:11.079
It's been a very long road.

37:11.720 --> 37:14.105
So now, I just really want to get my old life back.

37:14.755 --> 37:17.621
Any y'all need a landscaper, you know who to call.

37:22.824 --> 37:23.648
Quite a day.

37:23.940 --> 37:24.739
Quite a story.

37:25.118 --> 37:28.180
Um, I'd like to express my gratitude to District Attorney Devalos

37:28.252 --> 37:31.181
for his cooperation and his extraordinary courage

37:31.263 --> 37:34.171
in coming forward with the new evidence which exonerated my client,

37:34.242 --> 37:36.582
despite the fact that he was the lead prosecutor

37:36.633 --> 37:39.573
who tried and convicted him in the first place.

37:44.523 --> 37:45.235
Thank you.

37:53.208 --> 37:54.199
Congratulations.

37:54.696 --> 37:55.377
Thank you.

37:55.879 --> 37:57.691
Congratulations, man, I'm so happy for you.

37:57.845 --> 37:58.644
I appreciate that.

37:59.017 --> 38:00.805
Congratulations on your exoneration.

38:01.199 --> 38:03.510
Thank you for your kind words. You're totally welcome.

38:03.850 --> 38:06.104
You're under arrest for the murder of Samantha Robinson.

38:12.802 --> 38:14.266
Look at the gene pool.

38:14.491 --> 38:15.565
Oh, I almost forgot something.

38:15.638 --> 38:16.750
I'll take her now.

38:17.091 --> 38:18.080
I almost forgot.

38:18.516 --> 38:19.605
Oh, my gosh.

38:19.908 --> 38:20.809
What's this?

38:21.112 --> 38:22.462
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

38:22.875 --> 38:25.079
Girls, look at this big box.

38:25.786 --> 38:26.548
What's that?

38:26.953 --> 38:28.023
What is this?

38:28.616 --> 38:29.517
Oh, my God.

38:29.886 --> 38:31.273
It's a tennis racket.

38:31.871 --> 38:33.748
Wow. Do you even play tennis?

38:33.834 --> 38:34.709
Oh, yeah.

38:34.874 --> 38:36.906
I mean, I haven't played since before I met your dad,

38:36.957 --> 38:39.180
but I used to be pretty good, actually.

38:39.312 --> 38:40.936
Thank you, darling.

38:41.499 --> 38:45.217
My goodness, this is so different than the kind I used to use.

38:45.298 --> 38:46.526
What made you think of that?

38:47.433 --> 38:48.657
Are there any courts near you?

38:48.769 --> 38:51.432
Oh, yeah, at the club. You know, indoor, outdoor, they've got it all.

38:51.531 --> 38:52.768
But frankly...

38:54.560 --> 38:57.232
Frankly, I haven't been there in a while because you feel

38:57.289 --> 38:59.772
so conspicuous being there by yourself, you know.

38:59.852 --> 39:01.917
Well, they must have some sort of round robin program,

39:01.989 --> 39:04.053
something where they partner you up with people.

39:04.140 --> 39:06.167
Oh, sure, I'll bet they do.

39:06.274 --> 39:07.621
Hey, come on, let's see your serve.

39:07.713 --> 39:10.176
- No, no, my serve...
- Oh, yeah, yeah!

39:10.755 --> 39:12.521
That's the one thing, really.

39:13.532 --> 39:15.444
I'm not actually a very good server.

39:16.079 --> 39:17.426
Here, how about like this?

39:18.101 --> 39:19.260
That's not your serve.

39:19.347 --> 39:21.964
Just take the picture, or I'll show you my backhand!

39:25.317 --> 39:25.975
All right.

39:26.057 --> 39:28.106
Girls. Go get Grandma's bags.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.955
We're going to the airport right after brunch.

39:34.242 --> 39:37.707
Okay, now the coast is clear, um, what is it you want to talk about?

39:42.909 --> 39:44.501
Don't you ever miss the snow?

39:45.130 --> 39:45.863
Excuse me?

39:46.328 --> 39:48.227
When are you coming to Grosse Pointe?

39:48.745 --> 39:51.285
I want some of this noise around my house,

39:51.546 --> 39:54.003
and I want some company when I go to the mall.

39:54.132 --> 39:56.743
I want to teach my granddaughters how to play tennis.

39:57.024 --> 39:57.782
Okay.

40:00.025 --> 40:01.407
Wait a second.

40:10.639 --> 40:11.382
What?

40:11.965 --> 40:14.971
I don't know. You... been poring over the real estate section,

40:15.048 --> 40:18.109
talking about how hard the winter was, how you miss having people around.

40:18.222 --> 40:21.944
I-I got this idea in my head that you might want to...

40:23.060 --> 40:23.695
What?

40:26.833 --> 40:27.852
Live out here?

40:30.017 --> 40:32.087
Well, you're actually very perceptive.

40:32.661 --> 40:36.173
Okay. I flirted with the idea in my mind.

40:36.556 --> 40:38.471
I don't think Allison suspects,

40:38.870 --> 40:40.596
but the thing is, darling--

40:40.888 --> 40:42.542
and don't be offended-- but...

40:44.016 --> 40:46.797
I like being Grandma, but not all the time.

40:46.868 --> 40:47.722
Not yet.

40:47.836 --> 40:49.654
And I really like being a visitor--

40:51.082 --> 40:52.384
at least for now.

40:53.796 --> 40:54.712
Are you sure?

40:55.690 --> 40:57.062
Your feelings aren't hurt?

41:06.529 --> 41:08.552
Girls, girls. Come on.

41:08.864 --> 41:09.765
It's okay.

41:10.057 --> 41:12.472
Excellent service at the Hotel Dubois.

41:13.349 --> 41:14.666
Okay, everybody to the car!

41:14.732 --> 41:16.090
Do you really have to go, Grandma?

41:16.239 --> 41:20.406
Can't you stay here with us and sleep on the magic bed forever and ever?

41:20.467 --> 41:21.812
Grandma has things to do.

41:21.880 --> 41:25.725
I've got to get home and get my house ready for when you folks come visit me.

41:36.370 --> 41:37.410
I got it!

41:41.674 --> 41:43.030
Ah, you did okay.

41:47.245 --> 41:48.315
I'm coming!

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
