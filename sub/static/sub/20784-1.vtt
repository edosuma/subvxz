02:49.670 --> 02:50.629
Morning!

02:52.464 --> 02:54.049
Good morning!

03:26.749 --> 03:28.667
- Coffee?
- Okay.

03:58.781 --> 03:59.615
<i>Yes?</i>

03:59.782 --> 04:02.201
Good morning.
My name is Marta.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.036
I'm a supervisor at your bank.

04:04.203 --> 04:07.164
- Yes?
- <i>You've missed 6 payments.</i>

04:07.331 --> 04:10.417
Your outstanding debt
is over 120 thousand euros

04:10.584 --> 04:12.002
In accordance with the penalty

04:12.169 --> 04:14.213
- contract condition number 26...
- <i>Wait, Miss.</i>

04:14.421 --> 04:16.089
What contract?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.341
<i>The one you signed, sir.</i>

04:17.507 --> 04:19.301
I already told you, I'm broke!

04:19.468 --> 04:21.053
<i>No savings, nothing!</i>

04:21.220 --> 04:25.641
Yes, sir, but we're tired
of hearing the same old excuses.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.435
We've been forced to put you on
an international

04:28.602 --> 04:32.106
black list of fraudsters.

04:32.273 --> 04:35.192
Hey, I'm no mafioso.
I'm a simple truck driver.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.861
Worse! I'm a slave.
It's your fault I lost my trucks,

04:38.028 --> 04:41.073
you bastards. I lost my wife,
my home, my kids, everything.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.241
You know what?

04:42.408 --> 04:44.994
<i>Stick the debt up your arse!</i>

04:45.160 --> 04:46.412
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

04:48.497 --> 04:50.874
Sir, we're concerned about
the mental health

04:51.041 --> 04:53.126
- <i>of our clients.</i>
- What?

04:54.086 --> 04:56.088
We can offer you
psychological help

04:56.255 --> 04:57.756
at a 30% discount.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.596
Psychological help?
What the fuck

05:04.763 --> 05:06.223
are you talking about?

05:06.390 --> 05:10.686
You sound tense, sir.
Are your veins throbbing?

05:10.894 --> 05:11.854
<i>What did you say?</i>

05:12.062 --> 05:16.025
<i>Are you getting nervous?
Hear strange voices in your head?</i>

05:16.233 --> 05:20.612
Like your niece's?
Artichoke! How are you, sweetheart?

05:21.530 --> 05:22.656
Bastard!

05:22.823 --> 05:24.491
It's Alma!

05:25.326 --> 05:27.494
Alma! Alma!

05:27.661 --> 05:28.787
You bastard!

05:28.954 --> 05:30.789
<i>You got me there!</i>

05:30.956 --> 05:32.875
<i>Dance, Am, dance!</i>

05:33.667 --> 05:35.669
<i>You and that other wanker laughing.</i>

05:37.629 --> 05:39.048
She tricked me!

05:41.508 --> 05:42.718
Alma.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.555
We can't find him anywhere.

05:46.722 --> 05:49.308
We've called everyone
and looked everywhere.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.809
Nobody's seen him.

06:15.250 --> 06:20.381
THE OLIVE TREE

07:49.219 --> 07:50.679
You hear that?

07:51.722 --> 07:53.015
Grandad.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.603
Grandad, listen.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.155
<i>Is that a nightingale singing?</i>

08:08.322 --> 08:11.575
<i>No, it's a greenfinch.</i>

08:14.536 --> 08:17.331
They say the Romans
might have planted these.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.041
Who knows.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.919
This tree is at least
two thousand years old.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.215
You know how long that is?
I don't.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.592
I know it's a long time.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.053
It's been here my whole life
and hasn't changed.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.558
This is where the new tree sprouts from.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.769
I'll show you, then you do it.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.113
String...

08:50.656 --> 08:53.158
And who taught you
how to graft?

08:53.325 --> 08:54.910
Tighter, tighter.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.456
My grandad taught my dad
and my dad taught me

08:59.623 --> 09:02.876
and I'm teaching you.
That's how life works.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.170
You pass it down.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.506
A new tree!

09:07.756 --> 09:10.300
Let's hope it grows
like this one.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.181
Look, Grandad! A monster.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.766
You see it?

09:18.433 --> 09:19.977
Where?

09:20.143 --> 09:23.981
Here's an eye,
the other eye, the nose,

09:24.147 --> 09:26.233
and the mouth is super wide open.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.026
But it has no teeth.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.444
You see it?

09:29.945 --> 09:32.739
We'll keep the monster company.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.158
And we'll bring him grub to eat.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.799
It's not here, Grandad.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.015
It's not here.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.434
Come on, let's go.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.311
Come on.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.615
He's got us right where he wants us.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.326
Running after him,
as usual,

10:17.492 --> 10:18.535
at his service.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.665
Worried sick, chasing him around...
Give me a break.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.584
He just wants attention.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.506
Just like you with that hair.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.342
- Luis...
- Leave her alone.

10:33.508 --> 10:37.721
He has us all on edge.
Like he wants us to suffer.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.099
What? You disagree?

10:43.894 --> 10:45.103
Something to say?

10:47.814 --> 10:49.024
Great.

10:50.192 --> 10:51.693
Silence.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.031
I know that punishment
all too well.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.336
Rafa.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.965
Don't look at her.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.438
Where are you going?

14:29.494 --> 14:31.621
I fucking called you six times,
you moron!

14:31.788 --> 14:32.831
My battery ran out! I'm sorry.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.959
Change of plan, you have to take
the chickens to Valencia.

14:36.126 --> 14:38.712
Dickhead! I had to come
all the way out here to tell you!

14:38.837 --> 14:40.505
I'm sorry.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.841
- Fuck!
- Alma...

14:43.049 --> 14:44.092
Leave him alone, you arsehole!

14:44.426 --> 14:45.969
Crazy fucking bitch!

14:46.928 --> 14:50.932
I'm going to smash your face,
you arsehole!

14:51.099 --> 14:52.851
You don't have the balls.
Bring it on.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.686
- Came on then! Try it!
- Fuck, Rafa!

14:54.853 --> 14:56.938
Get back in the car!

14:58.815 --> 15:00.233
- What are you doing, Alma?
- Get out of here!

15:00.400 --> 15:02.777
Just you wait, you crazy bitch!

15:02.944 --> 15:05.113
Running off?
I'm standing right here.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.031
You're a fucking nutter!

15:06.197 --> 15:08.158
Anytime, champion!

15:14.623 --> 15:17.208
You're crazy!
He could have really hurt you!

15:18.376 --> 15:20.337
I don't give a shit.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.637
Rafa.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.724
You're not going to ask me
out tonight?

15:33.141 --> 15:34.768
What the fuck is wrong with you?

15:35.435 --> 15:36.436
Ask me.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.192
Ask me out, Rafa.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.020
You know what the nurse said,
Grandad?

16:19.187 --> 16:21.314
That the last thing you forget
are songs.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.319
Should we try it?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.698
Let's try a song.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.655
How should I put my lips?
Like this?

17:10.821 --> 17:11.614
Yes.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.532
No!

17:14.826 --> 17:16.953
It tickles.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.459
I'm more scared of you than the dentist!

18:06.878 --> 18:07.962
What are you doing here?

18:08.171 --> 18:09.422
Get off my land!

18:09.589 --> 18:11.549
- Dad, we only came to...
- Shut up! I know why you're here.

18:11.800 --> 18:12.675
Get off my land!

18:12.842 --> 18:16.179
And don't come back
or I'll shoot you!

18:16.346 --> 18:17.472
- Leave! Out!
- Take it easy.

18:17.639 --> 18:18.264
Out!

18:18.807 --> 18:20.558
You too, out!

18:21.476 --> 18:22.560
Out!

18:23.311 --> 18:25.105
30 thousand euros, Dad.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.524
5 million pesetas!

18:28.233 --> 18:31.027
You've worked like a slave
your whole life

18:31.194 --> 18:32.195
and what have you got?

18:33.404 --> 18:36.074
There's cheap mixed oil
everywhere.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.577
Nobody gives a shit
about your precious olive oil!

18:39.744 --> 18:40.537
Calm down.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.831
It's the truth!
Nobody cares about our work!

18:42.997 --> 18:45.959
Some of your friends have sold
their oldest trees

18:46.084 --> 18:47.502
for firewood.

18:47.669 --> 18:51.172
We've worked our asses off
our whole lives in those fields

18:51.339 --> 18:54.092
and you've never paid us
a penny.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.512
You owe it to us.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.184
What do you think?

19:05.937 --> 19:09.524
I think that I'm not going to sell.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.861
That tree is not ours.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.154
Damn it...

19:14.320 --> 19:17.448
It was passed down
from grandparents to parents

19:17.615 --> 19:20.869
and from parents to children.
If I sell that olive tree

19:21.035 --> 19:22.912
and give you the money,

19:23.079 --> 19:26.374
next week you won't have the tree,
the money or the restaurant.

19:26.541 --> 19:27.125
You just ignore us!

19:27.333 --> 19:31.129
That olive tree has no price.
It's sacred.

19:31.337 --> 19:35.216
That tree is my life and you want
to take my life away.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.677
It's only a tree!

19:37.844 --> 19:39.554
And we're your children!

19:39.721 --> 19:41.639
It'll be yours,
I can't take it with me!

19:41.806 --> 19:44.601
You're stuck in the past

19:45.018 --> 19:47.020
and you're sinking us all!

19:47.187 --> 19:51.357
That tree isn't even ours.
It belongs to life, to history.

19:51.524 --> 19:55.486
Don't give me that history bullshit!
We have families to feed!

20:11.836 --> 20:13.379
Grandad!

20:17.133 --> 20:19.260
Grandad!

20:20.094 --> 20:21.971
Grandad!

20:29.395 --> 20:30.855
Grandad!

20:31.481 --> 20:33.107
Grandad!

21:06.266 --> 21:07.350
There's a little girl!

21:07.517 --> 21:08.935
Stop, stop, stop!

21:09.352 --> 21:10.687
Be careful!

21:12.146 --> 21:13.147
The girl is up there!

21:13.856 --> 21:15.066
Stop the machine!

21:15.233 --> 21:17.485
- Get down!
- Stop the machine, cut the engine!

21:17.652 --> 21:18.695
Stop!

21:18.861 --> 21:19.904
Listen to your mother.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.531
Alma, come down, damn it!

21:21.698 --> 21:23.616
- Come down!
- Alma!

21:24.158 --> 21:24.993
Come down.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.078
Come down!
Get her down, Luis!

21:27.245 --> 21:27.954
Come down!

21:28.121 --> 21:31.040
Alma, come down from there!
Come on.

21:31.207 --> 21:34.377
- Come down!
- Come on, get down.

21:34.544 --> 21:35.795
Climb down, damn it!

21:38.798 --> 21:40.425
- Come on, climb down.
- Alma!

21:40.591 --> 21:41.801
Come down!

21:53.980 --> 21:57.275
Alma, come here, darling.
Don't cry.

22:08.119 --> 22:10.872
The monster...

23:18.689 --> 23:21.734
His weight loss and deterioration
are very alarming.

23:22.318 --> 23:27.156
If we can check him into the hospital
for a few days, we can run some tests,

23:27.323 --> 23:28.991
stimulate his appetite

23:29.158 --> 23:34.080
and maybe start thinking about
a home with full time care.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.627
If it's for the best.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.339
I try to spend as much time
as I can here, but...

23:43.673 --> 23:45.091
it's not enough.

23:45.383 --> 23:48.719
Luis can't do everything himself
and also watch Dad.

23:49.303 --> 23:51.597
We'll all be less worried.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.686
You're going to kill him.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.274
If he doesn't eat, he'll die.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.943
Your grandfather isn't
your grandfather anymore.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.487
Grandpa is gone, Alma.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.948
There's nothing wrong with him.
Nothing.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.576
You're telling a doctor
how to do her job?

24:17.582 --> 24:19.000
What do you mean, sweetheart?

24:19.208 --> 24:20.501
He's in mourning, that's all.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.296
Grandma died a long time ago.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.220
Not the fucking tree again!

24:31.762 --> 24:35.641
What are you trying to do,
screw up the whole family?

24:50.031 --> 24:53.284
It's like a lost child, isn't it?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.662
The worst part is not knowing.

24:58.789 --> 25:02.084
What if it's in a beautiful place
somewhere?

25:02.251 --> 25:03.294
Eh?

25:04.212 --> 25:06.047
With water,

25:06.923 --> 25:09.133
with people who take care of it...

25:10.009 --> 25:12.887
It would be a happy monster, eh?

25:16.516 --> 25:19.810
If you knew
would you be more at peace?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.452
Grandad, do you want to die?

25:39.455 --> 25:41.958
Is that it?
Do you want to die?

25:53.761 --> 25:54.720
Grandad!

25:57.431 --> 25:59.517
Grandad, I heard you.
I heard you.

25:59.684 --> 26:01.310
Did you sing?
Listen.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.229
<i>Let the wind blow...</i>

26:03.396 --> 26:04.522
Did you hear that?

26:05.815 --> 26:07.400
I think it was only
a deep breath.

26:07.525 --> 26:10.528
No, please, I heard you.
Sing with me.

26:10.695 --> 26:13.072
<i>Let the wind blow,
let it blow hard...</i>

26:13.197 --> 26:14.073
Please, Grandad.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.075
Please, please.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.058
I know you're there.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.728
I know it.

27:39.116 --> 27:42.161
It took me and your dad
a whole day to put those there.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.873
God!

27:48.167 --> 27:51.253
How did we swallow all that shit?

27:52.421 --> 27:53.839
For what?

27:54.340 --> 27:56.926
- I lost Estrella...
- He left Mum...

27:57.134 --> 27:59.387
No, that's not how it was.

27:59.553 --> 28:03.224
Okay, she left him. Because
he never took care of her.

28:03.391 --> 28:06.060
No wonder she fell apart
and left him.

28:06.227 --> 28:08.145
We worked like donkeys.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.398
We all made mistakes.

28:10.773 --> 28:12.942
And he took care of her,
in his own way.

28:13.067 --> 28:14.944
And how did he treat Grandad?

28:16.362 --> 28:18.864
Have you ever wondered
how Grandad treated him?

28:20.324 --> 28:22.076
Have you?

28:23.077 --> 28:25.287
Because with us he was a very tough
old man.

28:25.454 --> 28:29.041
We used to say he cared about
his trees more than us.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.877
With you he might have been marvellous,
not with us.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.879
Okay, Arti, leave it!

28:37.174 --> 28:40.052
You know how humiliating
it must be for your dad

28:40.219 --> 28:43.973
to move back to the family house?
To the same bedroom as a boy?

28:44.598 --> 28:46.726
Put yourself in his shoes.

28:56.610 --> 28:59.155
Jesus Christ.
You never give up!

28:59.613 --> 29:02.116
One thing I've never understood, Arti.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.243
At that time,

29:04.410 --> 29:07.538
banks were loaning money
to anybody, right?

29:07.705 --> 29:10.750
They say anybody
could get credit. Okay?

29:10.916 --> 29:14.920
Then why did you need
the 30 thousand for the tree?

29:22.094 --> 29:24.597
It's what the mayor
asked for...

29:26.182 --> 29:28.434
to build so close to the beach.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.564
Disgusting!
You're all the fucking same.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.733
No, we're not, Alma!

29:35.941 --> 29:38.152
We did it for you and your cousins.

29:38.319 --> 29:41.030
So we could have a family
business.

29:41.197 --> 29:45.201
Not our choice to bribe the mayor,
that's how things were done.

29:45.367 --> 29:47.995
Sorry we're not all fucking saints.

29:49.163 --> 29:50.831
We'll see what you do
for your kids.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.667
Look how happy he was.

30:00.758 --> 30:02.343
Look at Emilio.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.429
What ever became of him?

30:06.388 --> 30:09.141
I still remember the drinks
he used to mix.

30:11.227 --> 30:13.020
You know what I remember?

30:14.438 --> 30:18.317
His chubby fingers and bitten nails.
That's what.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.738
He used to stick them down my pants
when I was waitressing here.

30:25.366 --> 30:28.953
I tried to tell Dad all summer.
The whole summer.

30:30.037 --> 30:32.414
I was so ashamed
that I couldn't...

30:34.750 --> 30:38.087
One night I told him.
In the kitchen.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.174
Know what your brother said?

30:45.302 --> 30:46.303
Nothing.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.764
He didn't say a word.

30:49.390 --> 30:51.267
And he walked out.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.937
Alma, he must have been...

30:57.523 --> 31:00.442
He must have froze.
He didn't know what to do.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.363
Go to hell.

31:05.030 --> 31:08.200
You and your brother can both
go to fucking hell.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.036
He didn't know what to do?

31:11.203 --> 31:12.663
It's very easy!

31:12.830 --> 31:15.833
Protect your daughter,
arsehole!

31:29.471 --> 31:32.558
I have no idea.
Some went all the way to China,

31:32.725 --> 31:35.853
the Middle East, all over Europe,
even the Vatican.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.521
Thousands of them.

31:37.688 --> 31:40.524
Over a hundred
went to one bank in Madrid.

31:40.691 --> 31:42.568
Yeah, but I have the sale date.

31:42.735 --> 31:45.487
I only want to know
where it is, who bought it...

31:45.654 --> 31:47.990
Who do you think I am,
Interpol?

31:49.742 --> 31:51.368
Go on, get out of here.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.996
We're not serving hippies today.

31:54.538 --> 31:55.748
Do you remember me?

31:58.042 --> 32:00.711
I was in the tree, I climbed up
while you were uprooting it.

32:01.462 --> 32:04.715
You were shouting at me.
I was only 8 years old.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.259
Just get the fuck out of here.

32:08.552 --> 32:11.055
Your family made 30 thousand euros.

32:11.221 --> 32:12.890
Consider yourselves lucky.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.726
You know what?

32:15.893 --> 32:18.395
I'd start looking for your tree in China!
Beat it.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.439
I remember everything.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.192
Especially that pig-face
of yours.

32:31.158 --> 32:32.952
Go on, piss off!

32:53.013 --> 32:55.057
Your name is Alma, isn't it?

32:55.224 --> 32:56.141
Yeah.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.354
I was there that day.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.107
I was in the car.
I went with my brother.

33:03.273 --> 33:05.150
Yes, he's my brother.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.488
I'll never forget it.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.492
Your grandfather's tree
was very special,

33:13.659 --> 33:17.454
but many die within the first 15 years
of transplant,

33:17.621 --> 33:20.833
so you might never find it.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.293
But this could help.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.843
That's it, isn't it?

33:33.429 --> 33:34.596
Yes.

33:35.848 --> 33:36.807
Thank you.

33:48.610 --> 33:50.487
Dusseldorf, Germany.

33:53.824 --> 33:54.658
Wao!

33:54.825 --> 33:56.869
It's a huge company.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.169
There it is!

34:05.711 --> 34:07.504
It's in the middle of the lobby,

34:08.213 --> 34:10.257
Pride of place!

34:11.507 --> 34:13.802
- It's a star.
- What's the date?

34:14.887 --> 34:18.389
The website is up to date,
must still be there.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.685
Holy shit! They're using it
as the company logo!

34:22.101 --> 34:24.730
Your grandfather will be
super proud.

34:24.897 --> 34:26.690
It will kill him.

34:27.483 --> 34:29.485
Fucking locked up, no fresh air!

34:29.650 --> 34:31.862
Alma, it's not a tiger,
doesn't need to run around.

34:32.612 --> 34:36.867
It looks super cool, in one of the most
important countries in the world.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.036
It'll break his heart.

34:42.915 --> 34:45.708
That's Adri. I'm going, okay?
See you later.

34:45.876 --> 34:49.338
Ok, Photoshop, I can put it
where you want.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.882
How about outside in a garden?

34:52.341 --> 34:55.886
Little white lie so he doesn't suffer
and he'll never know.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.472
That's the problem, he knows.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.516
How could he know?

35:00.682 --> 35:03.018
He can't even talk.

35:04.728 --> 35:07.648
Wiki, he knows and I'm not
going to lie to him.

35:08.774 --> 35:12.236
Okay, fine.
Then what do we do?

36:28.103 --> 36:29.313
Grandpa.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.984
I know where it is.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.628
I don't know how,
but I'm going to bring it back.

36:55.422 --> 36:58.884
I'll bring it back, I promise.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.262
Hold on, Grandad.

37:04.473 --> 37:07.476
Hold on, please,
I'll bring it back for you.

37:17.152 --> 37:20.530
Mr. Gorbicht was German,

37:20.697 --> 37:24.034
retired, very rich, who moved
to Valencia. And very religious.

37:24.201 --> 37:26.662
And since the olive tree
is sacred in the Bible,

37:26.828 --> 37:31.208
he had a dream to donate
an ancient tree to his church.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.753
From the time of Christ.
And which tree did he pick?

37:37.756 --> 37:39.216
My grandad's.

37:41.301 --> 37:44.596
Mr. Gorbicht died 4 years ago

37:44.930 --> 37:47.891
I got this letter from
the minister at his church,

37:48.058 --> 37:51.728
the San Lucas Church
in Dusseldorf, Germany.

37:52.688 --> 37:54.773
Here's what he says:

37:56.733 --> 37:58.193
Quiet everybody.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.696
She's talking about Ramรณn.

38:00.862 --> 38:04.533
"I've spoken with my parishioners.
When we accepted Mr. Gorbicht's donation,

38:04.741 --> 38:08.745
our intentions were well meant,
but a mistake.

38:08.912 --> 38:11.206
Many young members
of our community

38:11.373 --> 38:14.626
are aware of the sacredness of nature,
and the environment,

38:14.793 --> 38:16.420
so after much prayer,

38:16.753 --> 38:19.881
we have made a decision.
We would like

38:20.048 --> 38:23.385
this sacred tree to bring peace
and harmony to your family,

38:23.552 --> 38:27.514
especially to the elderly gentleman
who has cared for it his entire life.

38:27.681 --> 38:33.270
Clearly, it should be returned to
the spot where it was planted and grew."

38:34.646 --> 38:36.231
They're giving it back!

38:42.279 --> 38:43.655
He speaks great Spanish.

38:44.531 --> 38:48.952
Yeah... He was a missionary
in Guatemala for 25 years.

38:50.287 --> 38:51.788
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.375
And where is the tree?

38:55.876 --> 38:57.044
In Dusseldorf.

38:58.462 --> 39:01.965
In the church gardens,
by the River Rhine.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.635
How did you find it?

39:05.886 --> 39:07.596
The garden centre told me.

39:11.641 --> 39:13.727
Shit! And here's me thinking the Germans

39:13.894 --> 39:17.230
were a bunch of greedy fuckers
who came down here

39:17.397 --> 39:21.651
in their old age to get their piles
sorted on our health system!

39:22.778 --> 39:24.946
I apologize!

39:26.156 --> 39:30.494
Now all we need is one truck
with a crane and two drivers.

39:31.036 --> 39:33.747
To Dusseldorf?
Cost a fortune!

39:33.914 --> 39:37.918
It's way, way up there, Alma.
Lots of countries in between.

39:38.085 --> 39:40.837
It's 1,659 kilometres.
That's not so far.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.673
We can take advantage of
the holiday weekend coming up.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.092
What do you mean, "we"?

39:47.636 --> 39:50.847
- If you borrow your boss' truck...
- What?

39:51.014 --> 39:54.184
You can take turns driving
and be back before he notices.

39:54.351 --> 39:56.937
Borrow a 250,000 euro truck

39:57.104 --> 39:59.356
from the psychopath
you just pelted with eggs?

39:59.564 --> 40:01.525
Nelson will cut your balls off.

40:03.151 --> 40:03.902
Hey...

40:04.361 --> 40:05.362
No.

40:08.281 --> 40:12.953
- And it's my wedding anniversary!
- But you're divorced!

40:13.120 --> 40:15.330
But we still love each other.

40:15.705 --> 40:19.334
If Estrella finds out I went
to Dusseldorf for a tree...

40:19.501 --> 40:20.710
No way.

40:20.836 --> 40:23.463
Diesel, insurance, tolls...
All that expense.

40:23.630 --> 40:25.841
I just sold my motorcycle
for 1,000 euros.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.050
Right.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.889
That's not enough.
What about the permits?

40:33.056 --> 40:36.143
You don't need permits.
Open borders.

40:38.145 --> 40:39.146
Grandad's dying!

40:39.312 --> 40:42.816
He can't even remember
his own children!

40:42.983 --> 40:44.526
He'll remember The Tree, damn it!

40:44.693 --> 40:47.988
Alma, you're too upset.
Too emotional.

40:48.196 --> 40:52.993
Let's think it over. We're talking about
a 14 ton load!

40:53.577 --> 40:57.622
If I have to walk all the way there
and drag it back myself, I will.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.417
You can both go fuck yourselves!

41:00.584 --> 41:01.334
Alma!

41:01.501 --> 41:03.753
- Wait!
- Don't touch me!

41:04.254 --> 41:06.465
We'll talk it over, Alma!

41:08.592 --> 41:10.802
She's mad as hatter.

41:13.597 --> 41:15.432
I sold an olive tree too.

41:15.599 --> 41:17.809
Fuss about nothing.

41:27.068 --> 41:29.404
Try it, whet your appetite.

41:30.780 --> 41:32.449
Come on, Dad.

42:06.233 --> 42:07.442
They never stop eating!

42:07.609 --> 42:09.819
From chick to chicken in 40 days.

42:09.986 --> 42:13.490
I'm going to puke!
I'm a vegetarian, Alma.

42:13.657 --> 42:17.118
Asking you to feed them,
not eat them.

42:17.285 --> 42:20.705
It's easy, Adelle.
Press a few buttons, that's it.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.416
I wrote it all down for you.
Here, take it.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.252
What if they explode?

42:26.169 --> 42:28.171
Hardly ever happens.
This one's dead.

42:28.338 --> 42:30.465
Get that thing away from me!

42:30.632 --> 42:32.717
- They have to be picked up.
- Disgusting!

42:36.054 --> 42:37.305
It touched me!

42:38.390 --> 42:40.100
Disgusting!

42:41.476 --> 42:42.477
Disgusting!

42:42.644 --> 42:44.437
I contacted a website
for Spaniards abroad

42:44.604 --> 42:48.608
and spoke to Sole,
a Spanish girl in Dusseldorf.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.151
She'll call you later on Skype.

42:50.318 --> 42:54.239
You're a genius, Wiki, thanks.
What about the energy company?

42:54.406 --> 42:59.786
I've sent emails to the CEO and
the head of each department, but nothing.

42:59.995 --> 43:02.163
I've called 40 times.
They just laugh and hang up.

43:02.330 --> 43:06.209
I don't think you'll get
anywhere near the tree.

43:08.211 --> 43:09.296
Phew.

43:11.631 --> 43:13.133
Alma.

43:13.300 --> 43:16.469
Stay a few days longer
and we'll think this through.

43:16.636 --> 43:18.638
I can't, Grandad's worse.

43:18.805 --> 43:21.641
Going without a plan
is stupid.

43:21.808 --> 43:23.101
Then keep thinking.

43:25.186 --> 43:28.064
Wiki, you've got the brains
I've got the brass neck.

43:29.649 --> 43:30.942
And you've got the chickens.

43:31.109 --> 43:33.278
- You're crazy.
- You should be locked up.

43:33.445 --> 43:35.405
Fine, I know!

43:36.239 --> 43:39.117
None of this makes any sense,
I can see that.

43:39.826 --> 43:42.662
But sometimes you just have
to dive in.

43:42.912 --> 43:44.372
Headfirst.

43:44.914 --> 43:46.750
You begin the journey...

43:47.876 --> 43:49.502
and people will help you
along the way.

43:49.669 --> 43:51.379
Why should they help you?

44:00.805 --> 44:01.890
- Here, take it.
- No, no.

44:02.057 --> 44:04.768
- Yes.
- From both of us,

44:04.934 --> 44:06.561
just in case.

44:18.782 --> 44:22.410
I'll be fine, okay?
Nothing will happen to me.

44:32.253 --> 44:34.381
Holy shit! Look at them.

44:34.547 --> 44:36.341
Like lambs to the slaughter.

44:36.508 --> 44:39.302
Not a clue of the mess
you've got them into.

44:39.469 --> 44:41.680
You have to tell them.
They'll go crazy.

44:41.846 --> 44:44.057
No, not a word.

44:44.224 --> 44:46.726
If I tell them now,
they'll be off, back home.

44:47.268 --> 44:50.939
Just think of something
and skype me later.

45:05.620 --> 45:06.996
Well, what do you think?

45:07.163 --> 45:08.331
What do I think?

45:08.498 --> 45:10.709
What kept you? That's what I think.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.046
I'll be damned.

45:49.706 --> 45:51.291
Ricardo, listen to me.

45:51.458 --> 45:53.501
He went to Madrid
with his girlfriend.

45:53.668 --> 45:55.587
He won't be back for 3 days.

45:55.712 --> 45:58.590
<i>I was wrong.
I want the truck back now.</i>

45:58.715 --> 46:01.718
We're on the road!
Calm down.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.720
I'll keep you posted,
I promise.

46:03.887 --> 46:06.431
- Where did you say?
- <i>Granada. It'll be fine.</i>

46:06.598 --> 46:08.141
Got a bad feeling
about this.

46:08.308 --> 46:10.935
Don't worry, it'll be fine.
Trust me.

46:12.228 --> 46:14.272
Okay, talk to you later.
Bye.

46:15.190 --> 46:18.735
That was the security guard
at the garage. Shitting himself.

46:19.527 --> 46:21.446
But he's a good lad.

46:21.613 --> 46:23.448
He wanted to help me out.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.620
About this German minister.

46:28.745 --> 46:30.413
You have got his address?

46:31.456 --> 46:33.208
Any more stupid questions?

46:36.127 --> 46:38.755
Don't shit me, Alma.
It's a long, long way.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.465
What if he changes his mind?

46:40.632 --> 46:43.968
Come on!
He's a minister, protestant, German.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.638
Can you imagine anyone more serious?

46:46.763 --> 46:47.680
Okay, then.

46:51.684 --> 46:55.980
<i>Granada, land of my dreams...</i>

46:57.857 --> 47:02.195
Granada he says, what a dick!
I'll be damned!

47:10.870 --> 47:12.872
<i>Hi, I'm Sole.</i>

47:13.039 --> 47:15.708
<i>This is Katrine,
a law student.</i>

47:16.501 --> 47:17.544
<i>This is Marine.</i>

47:17.961 --> 47:19.712
- Hi.
- <i>This is Sophie.</i>

47:19.921 --> 47:24.425
<i>She's a social media manager and
likes getting into trouble sometimes.</i>

47:24.634 --> 47:27.345
<i>Have you heard back from
the energy company yet?</i>

47:27.512 --> 47:30.557
No, my friends have tried calling
but they're brushing us off.

47:30.723 --> 47:32.642
<i>She hasn't heard back.</i>

47:32.809 --> 47:33.852
They think it's a joke.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.436
No wonder.

47:35.603 --> 47:38.857
<i>I wrote to the CEO of the company</i>

47:39.065 --> 47:41.609
<i>and offered to pay them back
for the tree,</i>

47:41.734 --> 47:44.529
<i>like a loan, with interest,
but...</i>

47:44.696 --> 47:48.950
She offered to buy the tree

47:49.117 --> 47:50.618
and pay in installments.

47:50.785 --> 47:53.162
How naive!
It's embarrassing.

47:53.329 --> 47:56.541
Coming all the way from Spain
without a plan!

47:56.708 --> 48:00.086
The tree is in their headquarters.
It's their fucking logo!

48:00.253 --> 48:03.047
<i>They paid 30,000 for it.
Is she crazy or what?</i>

48:03.214 --> 48:04.424
She says I'm crazy, right?

48:06.092 --> 48:07.343
<i>It's a bit too much, Alma.</i>

48:07.510 --> 48:10.179
<i>Do you really think you can
come and pick up the tree,</i>

48:10.346 --> 48:11.890
<i>just like that?</i>

48:12.056 --> 48:15.852
That's the problem,
the guys with me do.

48:16.227 --> 48:17.228
<i>What do you mean?</i>

48:17.395 --> 48:19.063
<i>I told them a lie.</i>

48:19.230 --> 48:22.692
<i>I told them the tree is at a church
and they're giving it back.</i>

48:22.859 --> 48:23.610
No fucking way!

48:25.028 --> 48:29.449
The guys with her don't know.

48:29.616 --> 48:33.077
This girl is fucking brainless.

48:33.244 --> 48:35.246
You can count me out.
Forget it.

48:35.496 --> 48:38.583
<i>Look, I know it's crazy.
But I couldn't just sit there</i>

48:38.750 --> 48:40.627
<i>and watch my grandfather
die of heartbreak.</i>

48:40.793 --> 48:42.003
<i>Do you understand?
I couldn't.</i>

48:44.380 --> 48:46.341
<i>Wiki sent us photos.</i>

48:46.674 --> 48:48.885
<i>I'm sorry about your grandfather.</i>

48:51.220 --> 48:53.806
<i>Can you please help me?</i>

49:00.313 --> 49:04.525
I didn't know.
I didn't see it coming.

49:05.318 --> 49:08.279
I had six huge trucks
like this one

49:08.446 --> 49:11.366
worth two million.
I was owed a fortune.

49:11.532 --> 49:14.285
One day I was somebody,
the next a nobody.

49:14.452 --> 49:17.163
It all vanished, like that.
No warning.

49:17.330 --> 49:18.539
You must have known.

49:18.706 --> 49:20.500
No, sweetheart.

49:21.876 --> 49:23.378
They lied to me.

49:23.544 --> 49:25.505
They lied to me.

49:25.672 --> 49:27.715
I lied to myself.

49:27.882 --> 49:29.717
I lied to Estrella.

49:29.884 --> 49:34.639
The lies got bigger and bigger.
More lies and more lies.

49:34.806 --> 49:36.933
I couldn't stop lying.

49:38.142 --> 49:42.605
One day, Estrella
totally smashed up the kitchen.

49:42.772 --> 49:46.859
The whole country
is lying to itself.

49:49.988 --> 49:51.864
That's what she said.

49:52.699 --> 49:54.242
And she left me.

49:57.120 --> 49:59.288
So I decided to change my life.

50:00.248 --> 50:05.378
I promised. I swore on our son's life
that I would never lie to her again.

50:05.545 --> 50:07.839
That I would always tell the truth.

50:07.964 --> 50:10.925
And yesterday I went to her house
and said:

50:12.427 --> 50:14.762
"Look, Estrella. I'm going
to miss our anniversary

50:14.929 --> 50:17.724
because I'm going to Dusseldorf.

50:18.182 --> 50:20.226
Well done, Arti.

50:20.435 --> 50:22.979
You told her the truth.

50:23.604 --> 50:25.565
She burst out crying.

50:26.190 --> 50:28.484
She thought I was getting paid.

50:29.652 --> 50:31.529
Did you explain to her?

50:32.113 --> 50:36.159
My lips stuck fast, Rafa.
Glued shut.

50:36.325 --> 50:38.953
You moron! She's going
to find out when you get back.

50:39.120 --> 50:41.706
I'm such a fucking idiot!

50:41.873 --> 50:44.417
Disgusted with myself.

50:44.625 --> 50:48.004
I could have told her.
I could have said: "Look, Estrella.

50:48.171 --> 50:52.800
I'm picking up the tree in Dusseldorf,
I'll be back two days.

50:52.967 --> 50:56.012
She'd have called me a dunce
but she'd have understood.

50:56.179 --> 51:00.892
But in the moment
I fucking lied to her again!

51:02.560 --> 51:05.855
Why can't we just trust each other?

51:06.022 --> 51:09.984
Look each other in the eye,
put the cards on the deck?

51:10.151 --> 51:11.736
Be honest with each other?

51:13.404 --> 51:16.115
Work it out together?

51:17.658 --> 51:19.202
Am I right, darling?

51:19.827 --> 51:21.120
Arti...

51:21.871 --> 51:23.039
Son of a bitch...!

51:26.793 --> 51:28.252
What are you doing?

51:28.419 --> 51:31.047
There's a wanker lives up here
who owes me 90 grand.

51:36.594 --> 51:38.554
Answer, you fucker.

51:39.013 --> 51:40.556
Answer.

51:43.059 --> 51:44.727
I know you're there.

51:49.357 --> 51:52.318
Come out, you bastard!
I know you're in there!

51:52.485 --> 51:54.695
Show your face,
you piece of shit!

51:54.862 --> 51:55.488
Arti.

51:55.655 --> 51:57.240
We're wasting time.

51:57.448 --> 52:02.912
No, no. I bet the motherfucker
is spying on us

52:03.079 --> 52:06.165
with a telescope from a bunker,
the bastard.

52:06.374 --> 52:08.251
Still has the fancy car.

52:09.460 --> 52:12.797
He says it's his brother-in-law's.
And the house his mother-in-law's.

52:12.964 --> 52:16.092
You lying piece of shit!
Bastard!

52:16.300 --> 52:17.552
And this?

52:17.760 --> 52:22.390
What about this? He bought it
for his idiot girlfriend.

52:22.598 --> 52:25.393
Because she loved shopping
in New York.

52:25.726 --> 52:28.479
That's what things were like
in those days.

52:28.646 --> 52:30.815
Weekend shopping in New York!

52:30.982 --> 52:33.025
Calm down and let's go.

52:33.901 --> 52:38.406
My sweaty 18 hours a day
working my arse off

52:38.614 --> 52:41.409
so he could buy this big lump of junk!

52:42.118 --> 52:44.579
He still owes me 90 grand.

52:45.037 --> 52:46.831
90 grand!

52:55.464 --> 52:58.718
I'll show the motherfucker.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.054
Where are you going?

53:18.196 --> 53:21.157
What I'm saying, you moron,
is that Germans

53:21.324 --> 53:23.993
- love American stuff.
- Do you understand your idiot uncle?

53:24.493 --> 53:26.912
We'll sell the statue
for a fortune there.

53:27.079 --> 53:29.165
What are you talking about?

53:29.332 --> 53:32.543
Like all those gnomes they buy
for their front gardens.

53:32.710 --> 53:36.297
Tell Wiki to find a rich German
and we'll sell it on the Internet.

53:36.464 --> 53:37.089
Okay.

53:37.465 --> 53:41.469
Hey, maybe we can
pass by Disneyland in Paris

53:41.636 --> 53:43.179
and pick up a Mickey Mouse?

53:59.028 --> 54:00.821
Two thousand years!

54:01.656 --> 54:03.824
He reminds me of my grandfather.

54:05.534 --> 54:08.829
Look at that.
It's not just a "thing" to him.

54:09.830 --> 54:11.123
It's sacred.

54:19.715 --> 54:22.301
Something isn't right here.

54:22.468 --> 54:24.053
What isn't right?

54:24.220 --> 54:29.767
Central Heating or a hot shower?
What would we do without them?

54:32.728 --> 54:34.230
What do you make of her?

54:35.064 --> 54:37.275
It all sounds a bit daft,

54:37.441 --> 54:39.694
but she gets me.

54:39.860 --> 54:41.737
She's a liar.

54:41.904 --> 54:45.741
She tricked her friends to come
to Germany for something that's not theirs.

54:45.908 --> 54:48.494
But she has a point!

54:48.661 --> 54:50.246
I could open a page on Facebook.

54:50.413 --> 54:54.500
Wouldn't take long.
See what happens.

54:54.667 --> 54:55.918
It's a good story.

54:56.127 --> 54:58.254
Some people make things happen.

54:58.421 --> 55:01.132
Yeah, right. The world is full
of irritating clowns.

55:01.257 --> 55:02.592
Katrin!

55:38.294 --> 55:40.588
FRANCE

56:26.759 --> 56:27.593
See who it is.

56:30.679 --> 56:31.931
Your brother.

56:37.603 --> 56:38.729
Your father.

56:39.313 --> 56:41.816
And he always will be, Alma.

56:54.620 --> 56:57.498
When I first told him,
he couldn't believe it.

56:58.624 --> 57:00.709
You know what he said?

57:02.128 --> 57:03.504
How brave you were.

57:03.963 --> 57:05.714
More than I can say for him.

57:09.051 --> 57:11.011
He's only trying to help.

57:12.012 --> 57:15.391
It's his way of saying sorry.
That's not so terrible, is it?

57:22.940 --> 57:24.108
Alma.

57:24.775 --> 57:25.943
Take it easy.

58:07.359 --> 58:12.198
Open cast mining,
chopping down forests, moving villages...

58:13.073 --> 58:14.909
"Sustainability."

58:15.075 --> 58:17.203
And their logo is a tree...
What hypocrites!

58:17.995 --> 58:19.830
How's the Facebook page going?

58:19.997 --> 58:22.750
More interest than I expected.

58:24.043 --> 58:27.338
There is an activist group
against the tree falling of the company.

58:27.505 --> 58:28.714
They're passing on our page.

58:28.923 --> 58:32.218
Others just think she's crazy.

58:47.191 --> 58:49.527
<i>Lots of people angry with
RRR's hypocrisy.</i>

58:49.693 --> 58:52.655
<i>We can organize something.
I need photos of the trip for FB.</i>

59:02.122 --> 59:03.749
You keep your mouth shut.

59:06.710 --> 59:08.546
I really like that.

59:09.755 --> 59:11.966
Not asking questions
the whole time.

59:15.469 --> 59:17.221
Good just to be in silence.

59:18.389 --> 59:20.808
Well, you don't listen much.

59:21.850 --> 59:23.519
I don't take it personal anymore.

59:25.896 --> 59:28.524
You've got too much
going on up there.

59:40.911 --> 59:42.162
Stop.

59:46.208 --> 59:48.586
Shit, Rafa.
I'm sorry, I can't.

59:50.296 --> 59:52.381
But you can with a stranger.

01:00:37.593 --> 01:00:39.219
<i>Alma, this is getting crazy.</i>

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:42.181
<i>A local paper saw
the Facebook page.</i>

01:00:42.348 --> 01:00:44.558
<i>They want to talk to you.
Can I give them your number?</i>

01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:47.895
<i>And your dad is driving me crazy.
He came to talk to me.</i>

01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:53.150
- What am I going to do?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:56.695
<i>This is exactly what I said
right before you left.</i>

01:00:57.196 --> 01:00:58.697
<i>What did the guys say?</i>

01:01:01.617 --> 01:01:03.285
<i>Alma...</i>

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:06.372
<i>Fuck!
You haven't told them!</i>

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:08.457
<i>Rafa's risking his job!</i>

01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:12.753
<i>Show him a little respect
and tell him, shit!</i>

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:28.352
Rafa's talking to his boss.

01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:30.562
He had a fight with his girlfriend
and he came back.

01:01:31.105 --> 01:01:32.523
He says he wants his truck.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:37.069
Come on, we have to make
a decision.

01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:46.745
<i>I'm going to rip your head off!</i>

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:50.374
<i>Do you realize what you've done?
You're going to ruin me!</i>

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:52.501
<i>Answer me, you fucking clown!</i>

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:54.461
One more insult
and I'll hang up on you.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.171
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

01:01:56.338 --> 01:01:59.049
Shut up!
And mind your manners.

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.801
I'm going to Dusseldorf.

01:02:00.968 --> 01:02:04.513
<i>What did you say?
You mean Dusseldorf, in Germany?</i>

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.390
<i>Fucking hell!</i>

01:02:06.557 --> 01:02:09.059
Listen, this is all my fault.
I lied to Ricardo.

01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:12.479
If you fire him, I'll sell your truck
to the Russian mafia.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:13.313
Rafa, cool it.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.984
<i>What the hell...?
I'm going to cut your balls off!</i>

01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:19.570
- I'll tell you something, Nelson.
- Rafa, don't...

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:22.781
You're a bully, an arsehole
and you can go fuck yourself!

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:29.037
You just lost your job, shit.

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:30.122
I don't care!

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:36.128
I'll find something else.
Maybe I'll stay in Dusseldorf.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.839
No. I want you both to go back.
Let me talk to him.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.383
I'll say this was all a mistake

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.594
and that I lied to you guys.

01:02:43.719 --> 01:02:47.723
Let me talk to him. I'll apologize,
return the truck and he'll forgive you.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:48.557
I can't bear it.

01:02:48.724 --> 01:02:49.975
Give me your phone.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:51.894
- Give it to me.
- No.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.062
Give me your fucking phone!

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:57.566
- Give it to me!
- That's enough! Fuck!

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:01.945
As usual, you've forgotten
one detail.

01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:05.032
This isn't just about you anymore.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.663
We have a say in this too.

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:13.916
Don't be an idiot.
Give me the phone.

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:15.459
No, Alma.

01:03:16.877 --> 01:03:18.462
I'll be waiting in the truck.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.554
I'm not going back
without the tree, Alma.

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:29.223
You don't understand.
This is a disaster.

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:30.432
Not after all this.

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:32.351
Please. Please.

01:03:32.518 --> 01:03:34.061
Arti, you don't understand.

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:36.688
Come on, let's go.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.151
No, everything okay.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.579
Have you ever felt like
you were going to burst?

01:03:57.793 --> 01:03:59.962
And completely crack up?

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:06.009
It happened to me once.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.055
When I was 18.

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:12.390
When I was training
with Valencia Football Club.

01:04:14.226 --> 01:04:15.728
I thought I was going to make it,

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:19.231
but one filthy tackle
screwed my career.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.733
I wanted to smash the guy's head.

01:04:21.984 --> 01:04:23.944
I wanted to kill him.

01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:26.613
I wasted two years of my life
in a rage.

01:04:26.822 --> 01:04:28.657
Augustin, my physio...

01:04:29.992 --> 01:04:32.661
knew what I was going through
just from his hands.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:37.499
And one day, after a session,
I broke down.

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:41.044
I burst out crying,
like a little boy.

01:04:42.004 --> 01:04:43.881
And he looked at me and said:

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.508
"Do you want to get better?

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:50.637
Then don't add to your own
misfortune."

01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:53.974
And suddenly I understood.

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.602
Look, Alma.

01:04:56.768 --> 01:05:00.188
You can spend your whole life
picking at the same old wound,

01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:02.858
feeding the pain,
no chance to heal.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:06.486
But sometimes it's better
to let things go.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:10.115
Move on.
Nourish what you have,

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:12.784
not what's gone.

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:16.580
You think I add to my own
misfortune?

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:21.043
We all do.
Some more, some less.

01:05:42.064 --> 01:05:44.775
GERMANY

01:06:04.503 --> 01:06:05.629
You haven't slept?

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:30.112
Germany.

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:35.242
Even the name makes me feel shorter
than I am.

01:06:36.368 --> 01:06:38.829
I know I'm not very smart,
but I feel twice as dumb here.

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:42.165
They're all so tall...

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:44.626
And they speak great English.

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:49.548
Must be something they put
in the sausages.

01:06:51.425 --> 01:06:54.094
Have you got the address
of the church?

01:07:11.737 --> 01:07:14.114
<i>An activist group has been
denouncing RRR for a long time.</i>

01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:15.824
<i>They loved your story.
Their logo stinks!</i>

01:07:15.991 --> 01:07:17.659
<i>Tell me when you get there.</i>

01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:57.741
- Think someone might steal it?
- No.

01:07:58.116 --> 01:08:02.037
It could be a big hit
right here next to the Rhine.

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:04.706
With boats passing by, like New York.

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:06.958
- Yeah, right.
- Sure.

01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:21.139
Thought we're going to a church?

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:23.892
First we have to sign papers
in an office.

01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:18.113
Holy shit!

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:22.533
That's our tree.

01:09:23.702 --> 01:09:26.121
What the fuck is it doing here?

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.714
Where's the minister?
Are we meeting him here?

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:22.344
No.

01:10:24.763 --> 01:10:26.056
What?

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.069
You mean...

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:40.987
there's no minister?

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:43.949
No minister, no church,

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:48.453
no Holy Willie who died in Valencia
and we're not getting the tree back?

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.121
Is that it?

01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:54.501
Sometimes your lips stick fast.
You said so yourself.

01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:57.545
Okay, back home, Rafa.
Your lips stick fast.

01:10:57.712 --> 01:10:59.673
But not in fucking Dusseldorf!

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.177
What the hell are we doing here?

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.764
Well, Alma?
What are we doing here?

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.475
What are we doing?

01:11:10.892 --> 01:11:12.811
Somebody explain to me
what we're doing here.

01:11:12.978 --> 01:11:14.562
- Let's go.
- What are we doing here?

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:16.856
- Can't you see she's in shock?
- She's in shock?

01:11:17.065 --> 01:11:18.858
I'm in fucking shock!

01:11:20.402 --> 01:11:22.362
- What are we doing here?
- Let's go.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.073
Don't fuck with me!

01:11:25.657 --> 01:11:27.659
Get your hands off, please.
Hands off.

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:30.954
Do we have permission
to take the tree or not? Tell me.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:35.834
Are you telling me
we drove up over a thousand miles

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:38.795
in a forty-ton truck
to pick up this giant tree

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:40.171
without permission?

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:41.506
Hey!

01:11:43.091 --> 01:11:43.925
Okay, okay...

01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:47.220
This tree belongs to my family!
This tree is ours!

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:52.434
Get your fucking hands off me!

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.145
I'm leaving!
I'm leaving on my own!

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:57.856
Let me go!
That's enough!

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.984
This is our tree!
Let me go!

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:05.655
Get off me.

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:12.537
Alma.

01:12:14.706 --> 01:12:17.500
Alma, tell me what
we're fucking doing here.

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:18.668
Leave her alone.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.712
What the fuck is going on here?

01:12:21.296 --> 01:12:22.756
Let's hear it.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:25.550
You didn't know, right?

01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:28.094
I had a feeling.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.096
A feeling?
You're joking me.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:33.516
What? I guessed but I wasn't sure.

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:36.394
Since when?

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:38.188
From the very start.

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:43.234
So I'm the only dickhead once again.

01:12:43.401 --> 01:12:46.696
Driving up here like a happy donkey

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:49.240
you two laughing
at the dunce?

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:51.701
Why didn't you say anything?

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.244
Why didn't you?

01:12:53.453 --> 01:12:56.414
Why didn't you tell me
to piss off?

01:12:56.581 --> 01:13:00.502
Why didn't you?
I was going to hitchhike, Rafa! Why?

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:03.129
Fuck!
How can you be so stupid?

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:06.674
How? You lost your job!
For what? Tell me!

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:08.009
Why?

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:10.512
Look at me, shit!
Why?

01:13:13.056 --> 01:13:14.724
I hate you. I hate you.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.352
And I hate you too.
You can both go fuck yourselves.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.479
Piss off back home
in your stupid truck!

01:13:19.646 --> 01:13:23.733
I tried to tell you!
Don't you see? I tried, shit!

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.320
I tried to tell you in the cafeteria.
What a pair of dickheads!

01:13:27.487 --> 01:13:29.447
Dickheads!

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:44.087
Let me get this straight.

01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:45.755
It's our fault?

01:13:47.257 --> 01:13:48.800
It appears so.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.851
You must really like her.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:02.313
It appears so.

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.337
I feel so...

01:14:28.465 --> 01:14:31.176
deceived, Alma. So betrayed.

01:14:33.553 --> 01:14:37.974
I'm so sick of everyone treating me
like a prick.

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:43.646
But that's what I am,
a prick.

01:14:46.191 --> 01:14:48.443
For trusting you.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:58.870
I've always loved you to bits,
since you were this high.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:03.249
And you couldn't trust me?

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:06.252
Look at me.

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:08.963
Me!

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:16.387
What was the plan?

01:15:25.897 --> 01:15:31.611
I've never felt so insignificant
in my whole life.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:35.198
Never.

01:15:42.622 --> 01:15:44.624
I'm going back to the truck.

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:48.503
Then I'm going home,
with or without you both.

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.626
I'm a stupid dickhead!

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:30.587
Stupid statue!

01:16:31.379 --> 01:16:33.381
Stupid life!

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:40.972
Dickhead!

01:16:41.139 --> 01:16:42.974
Dickhead!

01:17:04.579 --> 01:17:05.663
Where is she?

01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:11.210
She says she won't move until
she talks to the owner of the tree.

01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:15.089
Who does she fucking think she is,
Mahatma Gandhi?

01:17:17.717 --> 01:17:18.635
You're serious?

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:24.891
What a family.
What a bloody family!

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:32.065
Fine, I'm leaving.
It's over.

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:35.943
I'm getting in that truck and
going home, with or without you both.

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:37.612
You got that?

01:17:37.779 --> 01:17:41.407
That's what she said.
That you and I should go home.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:43.076
Fine, that settles it.

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:45.578
Let's go.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.080
Come on.

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:00.718
What a girl.

01:18:01.636 --> 01:18:03.054
Come on.

01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:05.348
What a bloody girl!

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.465
I'm sorry.

01:19:27.847 --> 01:19:29.766
I'm really sorry.

01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:22.944
Look.

01:20:34.205 --> 01:20:39.126
<i>Thanks for your support, Sole.</i>

01:20:39.293 --> 01:20:44.006
<i>We're camping outside the building
until they talk to us.</i>

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:20.751
Alma...

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.600
Dad.

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:44.525
Thanks for telling me.

01:21:48.738 --> 01:21:50.740
How is Grandad?

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.128
Please, don't stop talking to him.

01:22:04.295 --> 01:22:06.339
Don't stop.

01:22:07.465 --> 01:22:08.841
Okay.

01:22:28.194 --> 01:22:31.322
<i>Their spokesperson contacted me.
Said there's nothing to talk about.</i>

01:22:31.489 --> 01:22:32.907
<i>They won't see you.</i>

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:37.203
<i>I'm not leaving
until I talk to them.</i>

01:22:55.888 --> 01:22:58.933
<i>If they won't talk,
they'll have to listen.</i>

01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:04.248
HYPOCRITES
LIARS

01:25:50.354 --> 01:25:51.730
Luis!

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:52.982
Luis!

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:54.984
Can you hear me?

01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:55.985
What?

01:26:17.882 --> 01:26:19.300
Okay.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:21.969
Okay.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:59.752
Good job we brought the truck.

01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:20.541
I'm sorry, Grandad.

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.210
I'm sorry.

01:30:26.296 --> 01:30:29.091
I did everything I could,
I really did.

01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:37.516
Look.

01:30:38.267 --> 01:30:41.854
It's from our tree.
I found it.

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:47.151
And we're going to replant it.

01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:51.655
And this time we'll take care of it,
I promise.

01:31:01.999 --> 01:31:04.418
I love you so much, Grandad.

01:31:16.054 --> 01:31:18.140
I'll always love you.

01:31:31.278 --> 01:31:33.697
Let's go to the olive grove, Dad.

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:36.408
No.

01:31:36.575 --> 01:31:38.494
I feel too ashamed.

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:42.664
No right to be there.

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:44.708
I have no right...

01:33:51.376 --> 01:33:53.962
Can you imagine what life
will be like in 2,000 years?

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:03.722
Let's see if we can do it

01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:51.061
THE OLIVE TREE

01:34:52.305 --> 01:34:58.574
