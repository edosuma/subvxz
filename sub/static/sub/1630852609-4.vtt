WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.237
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend Race.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.771
I feel very attacked!

00:04.771 --> 00:07.808
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.544
Oh, my God.

00:10.544 --> 00:14.348
RuPaul: This is Untucked,
backstage at the competition

00:14.348 --> 00:18.352
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.254
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.254 --> 00:22.956
you're only getting
half the story.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.293
Director: That's a break
on the main stage.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.494
All cameras re-po.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.796
RuPaul: Lady Camden.

00:29.796 --> 00:32.165
Bosco. Jorgeous.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.667
Jasmine Kennedie.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.235
Maddy Morphosis.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.603
Daya Betty.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.472
Orion Story.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.675
Ladies, you are safe.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.578
You may leave the stage.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.581
I would have loved
to have been in the top,

00:47.581 --> 00:51.218
but I'm safe right now,
and I'm happy with it.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.988
I got to show that I'm not
just this talkative bimbo

00:54.988 --> 00:58.358
who wants to be
the center of attention.

00:58.358 --> 00:59.860
I'm really happy

00:59.860 --> 01:02.796
that I get to spend another
week in this competition,

01:02.796 --> 01:04.498
but it's so frustrating.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.500
I wanna have a moment.
I wanna be in the top.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.169
I wanna win a challenge.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.538
Queens walking.

01:11.538 --> 01:14.441
Send the queens
in three, two, one.

01:15.842 --> 01:17.711
-Ugh.
-Oh, my God.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.346
-Oh...
-Fuck.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.447
Thank the Lord,
thank the Lord.

01:20.447 --> 01:23.216
I've got to get outta my shoes.

01:24.384 --> 01:28.455
Three, three,
let's take the high top.

01:28.455 --> 01:32.225
Jorgeous, I know you're
really emotional right now.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.061
Yes, I was...

01:34.061 --> 01:35.996
girl, I was so fucking scared

01:35.996 --> 01:37.464
going out there
and watching that video.

01:37.464 --> 01:40.067
Like, I was not happy
with what I did honestly,

01:40.067 --> 01:42.703
and I really thought I was
gonna be lip syncing tonight.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.237
Like, I honestly did.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.406
I was just so scared
about this challenge.

01:46.406 --> 01:48.208
Like, looking at that,

01:48.208 --> 01:51.178
I was not happy
with what I was giving,

01:51.178 --> 01:52.913
and when they called my name,

01:52.913 --> 01:56.583
like, legit I thought
I was gonna be in the bottom.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.686
Like, it's so hard.
It really is.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.088
But Jorgeous,
like, something about you

02:01.088 --> 02:02.589
that I admire so much

02:02.589 --> 02:04.658
is that even if
you don't feel like

02:04.658 --> 02:07.094
you're necessarily the expert
at something that we're doing,

02:07.094 --> 02:09.763
like, you have the most
open mind of everybody.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.299
And I feel like
you just, like, dive in

02:12.299 --> 02:15.235
with no, like,
"Oh, I can't do this" attitude.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.104
Even if you feel
like you didn't do

02:17.104 --> 02:19.573
what you think
is your personal best today,

02:19.573 --> 02:21.141
like, you should still
be proud of the fact

02:21.141 --> 02:23.076
that you fucking
went for it anyway.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.778
Thank you.
I love you so much.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.380
People are gonna
fucking adore you.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.914
It's true.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.549
And girls, I just wanna say,

02:29.549 --> 02:32.152
like, y'all did
that damn thing.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.787
-Like, it was so funny.
-Your video was so funny.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.355
-Like, it was so good.
-Your video was so funny.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.791
Orion, you really, like--

02:37.791 --> 02:39.393
You keep on calling her
"OR-ion," and it's really--

02:39.393 --> 02:41.828
She calls me by
a different name every day.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.930
Clearly, I'm not listening.

02:43.930 --> 02:48.235
Orion, I am really happy
that you were safe.

02:48.235 --> 02:49.870
And you were so good,
so props to you.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.839
Yeah, well, I took the judges'
advice and I think it paid off.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.842
And I was, like, really hoping
I wasn't gonna be in the bottom,

02:55.842 --> 02:57.377
just for, like, my track record.

02:57.377 --> 03:00.514
But I'm so glad
that I'm here right now.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.616
This dress, stone
the house down boots, girl.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.084
I'm sure the lights
reflected perfectly.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.253
See, and the thing is
they wanted me to, like,

03:06.253 --> 03:08.255
tone it down because
they said I was doing

03:08.255 --> 03:09.856
a little bit too much sometimes.

03:09.856 --> 03:10.857
They wanted glamour,
and I was like, bitch,

03:10.857 --> 03:11.858
you're gonna get glamour
tonight.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.927
[laughs]

03:13.927 --> 03:15.328
Yeah, I'm happy
you're here, babe.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.763
I'm happy you're here.

03:16.763 --> 03:19.032
Kudos to team captain Maddy.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.767
I know! Maddy!

03:20.767 --> 03:23.403
Yeah, like, you really led,
like, a really strong video.

03:23.403 --> 03:24.905
I'm not gonna lie.

03:24.905 --> 03:28.675
I'm a little surprised
you aren't in the top.

03:28.675 --> 03:31.445
DeJa really shined for me,
watching it back,

03:31.445 --> 03:34.514
and so did Angeria,
that bitch.

03:34.514 --> 03:37.551
But I will say I feel like
that entire thing

03:37.551 --> 03:39.119
couldn't have been possible

03:39.119 --> 03:42.089
if we didn't have
such a strong leader.

03:42.089 --> 03:46.093
You did a great job at helping
us come up with material

03:46.093 --> 03:49.129
and execute it in a way
that is comical.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.330
I think you showed them

03:50.330 --> 03:52.332
just a little bit
of your crazy intellect,

03:52.332 --> 03:53.733
and, like, your humor.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.603
It's giving me all the warm
and fuzzies right now,

03:56.603 --> 04:00.006
hearing these kind words
from the other queens.

04:00.006 --> 04:01.208
I feel like in this challenge,

04:01.208 --> 04:02.843
I really got to show
the other queens

04:02.843 --> 04:05.045
the potential that I have
in this competition.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.446
Whenever I peeped over
at the judges,

04:06.446 --> 04:09.449
they were just laughing
or smiling the entire time,

04:09.449 --> 04:11.885
so you should be so proud.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.221
Like,, I'm honestly, like,
I'm really glad that I'm safe,

04:14.221 --> 04:17.057
because, like, I was close
to the bottom my first episode,

04:17.057 --> 04:19.226
and I was in the bottom
last time.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.794
But I really thought

04:20.794 --> 04:23.730
I could make it in the top
this time, too,

04:23.730 --> 04:24.998
but I'm still here, so...

04:24.998 --> 04:27.234
-And your mug.
-Tonight.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.870
-It looks so good, bitch.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.672
Soft, your pores are hidden.

04:32.672 --> 04:35.342
Not the pores! [laughs]

04:35.342 --> 04:37.010
You really worked it out, baby.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.512
Like, the cow scene, I was like,

04:38.512 --> 04:39.980
oh, I don't even know
what's going on.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.448
[all laugh]

04:41.448 --> 04:43.483
-That was the best scene.
-Okay, well, I mean,

04:43.483 --> 04:45.152
but still,
it was just so funny.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.954
And I looked at Michelle,
and she was like,

04:47.954 --> 04:49.222
but, like, in a good way,
you know.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.991
How are you feeling, Cam?

04:50.991 --> 04:52.192
Because I know you yesterday

04:52.192 --> 04:53.360
were, like,
a little, like, tiffy.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.561
I'm gonna be real
with you guys.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.830
I shut down when I'm scared.

04:56.830 --> 04:57.831
You know what I mean?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.533
But I wanna have fun,

04:59.533 --> 05:01.067
so I kind of went for it.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.570
And then watching the video,
I was like, oh, I look crazy.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.539
Like, my makeup looks nuts.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.207
And, I mean,
I went for it, right?

05:07.207 --> 05:09.276
So I do feel good that
I didn't just sit back

05:09.276 --> 05:12.112
and, like, do something
that I know is safe.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.147
But there's nothing like

05:14.147 --> 05:16.683
standing there in front of
the people you admire the most,

05:16.683 --> 05:19.519
knowing that they can tell you,
just fucking go home.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.621
And then you start to think
about the people at home

05:21.621 --> 05:23.323
that are, like, rooting for you.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.691
Right.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.763
I feel like I'm holding back,

05:29.763 --> 05:34.768
and I need to find a way to try
and stand out in a good way.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.171
[sighs]
It's frustrating

05:38.171 --> 05:40.674
because I feel like
I'm getting in my own way.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.842
I feel the same way.

05:42.842 --> 05:46.146
I mean, like, clearly
I picked the team

05:46.146 --> 05:47.681
that I don't work with often.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.916
And obviously, like,
me and Kornbread

05:49.916 --> 05:51.918
didn't really get, like,
off on a good foot

05:51.918 --> 05:54.254
with the whole
"me talking over" thing.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.655
There's a difference
between talking

05:55.655 --> 05:57.591
and having a conversation.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.359
And you don't have
conversations,

05:59.359 --> 06:01.962
and it's, like, it's a lot of us
in here, absolutely.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.430
-No, that--I see, I see.
-But you gotta--like now.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.867
But I really tried
to hone it back.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.769
You really succeeded, baby.

06:09.769 --> 06:12.706
And, like, after, like,
everything that happened,

06:12.706 --> 06:14.241
I kind of was just,
like, analyzing,

06:14.241 --> 06:17.110
like, every little
minute detail.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.614
Jasmine is definitely, like,
annoying little sister vibes.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.383
And questioning
what RuPaul said,

06:23.383 --> 06:25.518
like, make sure
you make the right decision.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.488
She's working really hard.

06:28.488 --> 06:31.291
But no matter
what the conversation,

06:31.291 --> 06:34.461
she is, like, I'm so glad you've
brought up this opportunity

06:34.461 --> 06:36.696
for me to talk about myself.

06:36.696 --> 06:40.233
Like, I was really nervous
that I picked the wrong team,

06:40.233 --> 06:44.371
but I'm happy how it turned out.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.373
-Yeah.
-Ooh!

06:46.373 --> 06:48.942
Ho-ney chi-ld.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.511
-Oh, bitch.
-Hello, hello, hello, hello.

06:51.511 --> 06:53.446
-How y'all doing?
-Hello! How y'all doing?

06:53.446 --> 06:55.649
-We missed you.
-We missed y'all, too.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.584
It's been a minute.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.618
-Come on in, come on in.
-Ooh, yeah.

06:58.618 --> 06:59.653
I don't know
if we got enough room

06:59.653 --> 07:01.421
for all that ass
and those titties.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.555
Oh!

07:02.555 --> 07:03.990
Like a big old cherry.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.759
To the tea, girls.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.127
Straight to it.
Let's get 'er done.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.728
Let's do it.

07:08.728 --> 07:13.300
But, yes, I think it's me
and Kerri in the bottom.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.903
But they said
they laughed at what I did,

07:16.903 --> 07:19.673
and I do think
I'm a hoot and a half.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.142
But they said it was one-note.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.812
I'm a very in-your-face
kind of ho.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.914
If the judges said we needed
to eat, I woulda eat.

07:27.914 --> 07:29.115
Show me your chops!

07:29.115 --> 07:31.384
Bitch, I got pork chops, ho!

07:31.384 --> 07:33.219
Where the fuck
she get the pork chops from?

07:33.219 --> 07:35.989
Show me your fish and chips,
motherfucker!

07:38.525 --> 07:40.727
Who do you think the tops were
based off the critiques?

07:40.727 --> 07:42.329
Oh, definitely DeJa.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.397
I think DeJa won this one.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.665
Y'all video
was funny as fuck.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.133
Bitch, I was over there
kiking, girl,

07:47.133 --> 07:49.102
and you look good as a cow, ho.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.171
[all laugh]

07:51.171 --> 07:52.372
I will tell you this much.

07:52.372 --> 07:56.343
So as I told everyone,
I am not an actor.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.645
I have no theater background,
none of that kind of stuff.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.214
We didn't have that in my town.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.850
And so this was
the one challenge

08:03.850 --> 08:05.218
that I was
the most scared about.

08:05.218 --> 08:08.421
I think my issue is
I might be an actor or whatever,

08:08.421 --> 08:10.990
but I need to pay attention
to exactly what I'm doing.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.459
Was I funny?
Abso-fucking-lutely, girl.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.728
They loved the look, obviously.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.463
It was a phenomenal look.
Bigger hair.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.031
It's, like, smaller details

08:18.031 --> 08:19.899
that I am okay
with taking as critique.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.134
It's fine.

08:21.134 --> 08:24.137
I just don't agree
with me being in the bottom,

08:24.137 --> 08:26.773
but I do strongly feel
that I am in the bottom.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.141
-Does that make sense?
-Yes.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.576
If you don't mind me asking,

08:29.576 --> 08:31.411
who do you feel should have been
in the bottom other than you?

08:31.411 --> 08:33.380
-Yeah, I was gonna ask that.
-That wasn't my point.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.749
No, I know.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.485
Not a concern of mine.
I really do not care.

08:38.718 --> 08:40.620
-Okay.
-No shade, but...

08:40.620 --> 08:42.255
I'm not trying to be that
person.

08:42.255 --> 08:45.625
And I know Jasmine is young,

08:45.625 --> 08:48.661
but she's got to do the work
to show she's grown.

08:48.661 --> 08:51.398
My point was I feel like
I wasn't in the bottom,

08:51.398 --> 08:53.466
so that's an energy that
I'm not even gonna get into.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.135
Because there are people here

08:55.135 --> 08:57.103
who have to focus on what they
have to go do on that stage

08:57.103 --> 08:58.405
because other people
in the bottom.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.573
So, yeah, the rest of you guys
can express yourselves.

09:01.908 --> 09:05.278
Willow got amazing critiques
as well.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.147
Really amazing critiques, yes.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.416
-How do you feel?
-I feel really good.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.684
I definitely feel like
it's one of you,

09:11.684 --> 09:14.921
because I think y'all's video
was funnier.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.956
Like, seriously,
congratulations on that.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.092
But, no, they loved the look.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.895
They said I just keep surprising
them, which felt good.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.664
You won, like,
the last episode.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.132
You fuck it up on this one.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.600
Like, you're the silent killer.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.902
Yeah, Miss Thing.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.404
I feel like at this point
these are my sisters,

09:31.404 --> 09:34.174
and we already
care about each other.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.276
And I'm just happy to hear

09:36.276 --> 09:39.312
that they understand
a lot of my drag.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.482
Alyssa, sis, how do you feel?

09:45.185 --> 09:47.921
I think I'm probably
in the bottom two.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.290
I feel it.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.125
And I think I'm gonna be
in the bottom with Kerri,

09:52.125 --> 09:55.895
because even though you feel
like you are in the bottom,

09:55.895 --> 09:57.997
Kornbread, like, you were funny.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.600
And that's the reason of this
challenge, like, be funny.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.235
Um...

10:03.670 --> 10:06.272
-Let it out, baby.
-Don't be afraid of anything.

10:08.441 --> 10:12.779
I wanted to try harder
to be on your level.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.515
They told me it was funny,

10:15.515 --> 10:17.083
but it was too much,

10:17.083 --> 10:19.886
and I don't know, I just
put so much pressure on me

10:19.886 --> 10:23.723
to be like, okay, you need to be
more, more, more, more, more

10:23.723 --> 10:24.858
to show them, like, who you are.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.426
But that's not the case.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.496
The one thing that I learned
about this challenge

10:29.496 --> 10:31.564
is like, you need
to be yourself.

10:31.564 --> 10:36.336
Like, and go for,
like, pfft, just relax.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.305
But, yeah, I think
I'm gonna be in the bottom,

10:39.305 --> 10:43.476
and it sucks, because
I think I look fabulous.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.179
-You do.
-You do.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.314
-[laughs]
-Thank you, guys.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.351
Like, not only my team,
like, all of you.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.587
Because all of you, like,
make me feel comfortable,

10:54.587 --> 10:58.892
and, yeah, I appreciate
all of you, like, dearly.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.126
-You're amazing.
-Thank you.

11:00.126 --> 11:02.729
I don't really know
how to feel.

11:02.729 --> 11:06.766
I feel a little frustrated,
obviously.

11:06.766 --> 11:10.136
I think I will be
one of the bottom girls.

11:10.136 --> 11:13.573
And it kind of sucks, because
out of the JLo challenge,

11:13.573 --> 11:17.777
I am the one girl actually
wearing JLo's outfit.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.879
But they also said, like,
they're kind of getting sick

11:19.879 --> 11:22.949
of seeing me
look gorgeous and pretty.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.984
I think for you, Kerri,

11:24.984 --> 11:27.654
you want to be beautiful
all the time.

11:27.654 --> 11:28.688
Yes.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.157
And I'm here to tell you
you are.

11:31.157 --> 11:35.161
So let's just throw that away.
Get ugly.

11:35.161 --> 11:39.399
If you let your guard down,
you're gonna go so much further.

11:40.967 --> 11:44.170
It was weird to hear, like,
we want you to let loose,

11:44.170 --> 11:45.838
and I'm just like, okay.

11:45.838 --> 11:47.540
But that's not you.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.875
Well, the thing is
I feel like I am loose.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.376
I don't feel uptight.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.478
Well, girl...
[all laugh]

11:52.478 --> 11:54.213
Get untucked, girl.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.415
[all laugh]

11:55.415 --> 11:58.318
I do feel loose
figuratively speaking.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.053
It's the drinks, y'all,
it's the drinks.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.588
Uh-huh.
[all laugh]

12:01.588 --> 12:06.092
The best I can do is go into
this challenge of lip syncing

12:06.092 --> 12:10.129
and pull it out, and hope
to come back and have homework.

12:10.129 --> 12:11.664
They wanna see a lot more,

12:11.664 --> 12:14.867
and I'm gonna have to switch
outfits with one of y'all,

12:14.867 --> 12:17.103
because I don't have
anything ugly, but--

12:17.103 --> 12:19.138
[all laugh]
I got plenty, girl.

12:19.138 --> 12:20.473
I'll trade outfits with you.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.141
That's what they need.

12:22.141 --> 12:23.710
Come on, shady bitch. Oof.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.145
10 minutes till main stage.
Thank you.

12:26.145 --> 12:30.750
Watching the video, I was really
disappointed about what I did,

12:30.750 --> 12:34.253
and I really thought it was
gonna be me in the bottom.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.990
And when they called my name
and said that I was safe,

12:36.990 --> 12:38.491
like, I was really gagged.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.727
Because I felt like...

12:47.734 --> 12:48.968
-You're safe, right?
-Yes.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.770
-You got another week here?
-Yes.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.205
There ain't no point
in you feeling bad.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.940
They saw what they
needed to see from you.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.475
They know there's
something there for you.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.410
That's the last time I'm gonna
encourage you, motherfucker.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.213
Okay!
[all laugh]

13:00.213 --> 13:01.547
You can take my spot
if you want to, bitch,

13:01.547 --> 13:02.548
if you feeling that bad.

13:02.548 --> 13:06.052
[all talking at once]

13:06.052 --> 13:09.255
If I don't get to talk
to you ho's after this,

13:09.255 --> 13:10.556
which I probably will, bitch,

13:10.556 --> 13:12.125
because, girl, I'm gonna
throw my weight through it,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.093
I love every last one of you

13:14.093 --> 13:16.229
no matter how much
I hate all of y'all.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.364
Yes!
[all laugh]

13:18.364 --> 13:20.433
I'm, like, though you might be
in the bottom tonight,

13:20.433 --> 13:22.535
and I feel almost like
I'm partly responsible.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.936
No, no, you're not.

13:23.936 --> 13:25.471
Like, I was really trying
to focus on, like, everybody,

13:25.471 --> 13:27.273
but I feel like I didn't take,
like, enough time

13:27.273 --> 13:30.176
to, like, really make sure
we had our shit together.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.211
No, no, no. You guys know
that I tried my best,

13:32.211 --> 13:35.515
and, like, you literally
do a great job as captain.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.050
And I feel very proud
of our group,

13:37.050 --> 13:40.620
even though I'll probably
be in the bottom.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.523
I'm very happy
that you choose me,

13:43.523 --> 13:47.160
so whatever happens,
I feel proud.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.661
And thank you.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.635
Ha ha!

13:57.537 --> 14:00.406
I know that I am in the bottom.

14:00.406 --> 14:04.610
But, baby, if I gonna
lip sync for my life,

14:04.610 --> 14:06.612
those bitches
need to be prepared,

14:06.612 --> 14:10.016
because I'm not gonna be easy
to go home.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.117
No, no, no, no, no.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.653
I'm not surprised
to be in the bottom,

14:13.653 --> 14:16.522
and I'm totally feeling ready

14:16.522 --> 14:18.424
to slay the hell
out of this song.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.159
I'm gonna lay it out.

14:20.159 --> 14:23.429
I'm gonna prove
I deserve to be here.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.865
It's time for the main stage.
Please follow me out.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.300
Come on, let's go.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.601
All right,
it's time to go, girl.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.169
-Queen walkin'.
-[laughs]

14:30.169 --> 14:32.672
Maddy, can you help me, please?

14:36.075 --> 14:38.077
I see it, I see it, okay.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.612
-Here we go.
-Can you hand me my little--

14:39.612 --> 14:40.580
Skipping, bitch.

14:41.347 --> 14:43.549
RuPaul:
Welcome back, ladies.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.218
I've made some decisions.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.856
RuPaul:
Kerri Colby, Alyssa Hunter,

14:49.856 --> 14:51.157
the time has come

14:51.157 --> 14:53.993
to lip sync

14:53.993 --> 14:58.097
for your life!

15:00.233 --> 15:03.770
Kerri Colby, shantay you stay.

15:03.770 --> 15:08.775
Alyssa Hunter.
If you have the gold bar,

15:08.775 --> 15:11.043
you will be saved.

15:11.043 --> 15:13.346
It's just chocolate.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.949
Alyssa Hunter, sashay away.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.888
[applause]

15:26.225 --> 15:29.061
I am very disappointed
right now.

15:29.061 --> 15:35.501
But I do my best,
and I don't have no regret.

15:35.501 --> 15:39.605
I am very happy of who I am
and very proud,

15:39.605 --> 15:43.576
and that is something
that is not gonna change.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.881
Ahh.

15:48.881 --> 15:53.219
My final day here.

15:53.219 --> 15:58.024
Damn, there's so much stuff
to pack.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.459
Where I gonna start?

16:07.166 --> 16:09.702
I feel disappointed.

16:09.702 --> 16:13.739
I have so many looks that
I'd love to show to the world.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.245
Aw! This is my mom.

16:19.245 --> 16:23.616
Every time I just get in drag,
this picture motivates me a lot.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.219
My mom is my angel.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.354
I love you, Mom.

16:28.354 --> 16:31.190
Love you, love you, love you,
love you, love you.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.203
Oh, look,
there's some notes here.

16:44.203 --> 16:46.939
Oh, now I'm gonna
have to start to cry.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.676
Miss Bosco.

16:50.676 --> 16:55.414
"Baby, you are so poised
and beautiful, powerful,

16:55.414 --> 16:58.751

a connection to you."

I, um.,..

17:23.209 --> 17:25.544
Yeah.

of a true sisterhood.

is gratefulness.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.379

18:00.379 --> 18:01.781
I'm not sad at all.
