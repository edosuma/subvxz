07:44.218 --> 07:45.852
between my fingers.

07:45.853 --> 07:47.787
I got her suspended
from the second grade.

07:47.821 --> 07:51.290
Second grade?
That little turd hoarded all the good markers.

07:51.291 --> 07:53.693
But eventually,
she came back to school.

07:53.694 --> 07:57.029
And she made
the next ten years

07:57.030 --> 07:59.232
of my life miserable.

07:59.233 --> 08:00.800
It's not worth it.

08:00.801 --> 08:02.201
Be nice to Wuntch.

08:02.236 --> 08:04.837
"Be nice to Wuntch?"

08:04.838 --> 08:06.906
You may go now,

08:06.907 --> 08:09.275
Mother Diaz.

08:12.513 --> 08:15.114
I hate this.
Everyone is looking at us.

08:15.149 --> 08:18.151
Only because we're equally
massive, beautiful men in tuxes.

08:18.152 --> 08:20.753
Yeah.
Sophia.

08:20.754 --> 08:23.823
Heeeeeeey,
girlfriend.

08:23.824 --> 08:25.792
That came out saucier
than I was expecting.

08:25.826 --> 08:28.628
Yeah. Hey, Jake,
What are you doing here?

08:28.629 --> 08:30.563
I thought we agreed
to press pause.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.331
We did.
I'm not here to see you.

08:32.332 --> 08:34.200
I'm here to see your boss,
Geoffrey Hoytsman.

08:34.234 --> 08:35.835
We're gonna bond.
Oh, God.

08:35.836 --> 08:37.937
Oh, good indeed.
You misheard me on purpose.

08:37.938 --> 08:39.806
Possibly.
Look, I'm gonna charm him.

08:39.807 --> 08:41.407
He's going to start giving you
the good cases again.

08:41.408 --> 08:44.210
This is gonna work.
No, it's not.

08:44.211 --> 08:46.512
How can I explain this?
Oh, Okay.

08:46.513 --> 08:49.248
Imagine this room is full
of super-intelligent robots...

08:49.283 --> 08:51.551
Oh.
Hell-bent on ending humanity,

08:51.552 --> 08:53.186
and you are
a working-class human

08:53.187 --> 08:54.420
who just entered
their swarm-hive.

08:54.455 --> 08:56.322
Okay, love this,
love you, keep going.

08:56.357 --> 08:58.024
Oh, that's a really
weird moment

08:58.025 --> 08:59.826
to say you love me
for the first time.

08:59.860 --> 09:01.194
Oh no.
Was it?

09:01.228 --> 09:02.428
I'm just gonna blow past that.
Yeah.

09:02.429 --> 09:05.565
Look, the point is,
you can't charm robots.

09:05.566 --> 09:08.167
So you should go before they
pod you and harvest your brain.

09:08.202 --> 09:10.003
Look, I've done my research
on Hoytsman:

09:10.004 --> 09:13.406
Skiing, nature, Atlantic City,
I'm ready for him.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.509
Sophia.
Sergeant Jeffords.

09:16.510 --> 09:17.877
Detective Peralta.

09:17.911 --> 09:20.313
Please, my friends call me
Jakey Snowpants,

09:20.314 --> 09:21.914
because I'm skiing so much.
[chuckles]

09:21.915 --> 09:23.983
Carving moguls on
a black diamond.

09:24.018 --> 09:25.718
I prefer cross-country
skiing.

09:25.719 --> 09:27.987
It's not a sport if gravity
does the work for you.

09:28.022 --> 09:30.223
Yeah.
Gravity sucks.

09:30.224 --> 09:32.191
Not the movie, the theory.
Anyway, I've been spending

09:32.226 --> 09:33.726
most of my weekends
in Atlantic City these days.

09:33.761 --> 09:35.862
Oh, that place is a dump.
No.

09:35.863 --> 09:39.532
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to steal Sophia away.

09:39.533 --> 09:42.235
You can't charm
the robots.

09:42.236 --> 09:44.037
What in the frig
was that?

09:44.038 --> 09:46.005
He's always
in Atlantic City.

09:46.006 --> 09:47.740
Why would he go someplace
he hates so much?

09:47.775 --> 09:49.909
Unless there was something
there he loves.

09:49.910 --> 09:51.911
I bet he loves gambling.

09:51.912 --> 09:53.813
Just like I'm here
in this dump

09:53.814 --> 09:55.648
because of Sophia,
who I now love.

09:55.683 --> 09:57.283
You're really going hard
on this love thing.

09:57.318 --> 09:58.685
Well, I said it out loud.
It's on the record.

09:58.686 --> 10:01.688
I can't take it back
Just get on board, Terry.

10:01.689 --> 10:03.456
Hello, Gina.
Ah!

10:03.457 --> 10:04.724
What are
you creeps doing?

10:04.758 --> 10:06.759
You made me look
away from my phone.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.561
You better pray
I didn't miss a text.

10:08.595 --> 10:10.797
In your two seconds
you looked away?

10:10.798 --> 10:13.599
17 texts.
All of them important.

10:13.634 --> 10:15.635
Amy suggested
we negotiate terms,

10:15.636 --> 10:18.004
so if you agree
to give my dad his blessing,

10:18.005 --> 10:19.305
here's what I'll do
for you.

10:19.306 --> 10:22.475
"You will never see me
in my pajamas on a family trip.

10:22.476 --> 10:23.710
"We will never share
a bunk bed.

10:23.744 --> 10:25.645
"And I won't force you
to participate

10:25.646 --> 10:28.514
in our annual themed
Christmas cards."

10:28.515 --> 10:30.883
This year my dad was Mary
and I was the baby Jesus.

10:30.884 --> 10:33.286
Yeah, I know.
Got one. Lived the nightmare.

10:33.287 --> 10:34.854
Well, the list goes on.
I signed it.

10:34.855 --> 10:36.556
Amy notarized it.
I'm a notary.

10:36.557 --> 10:38.491
No big deal.
I met the comptroller.

10:38.525 --> 10:39.892
Okay, you know what?

10:39.893 --> 10:42.061
This isn't about out lives
getting intertwined, okay?

10:42.062 --> 10:43.830
I'm actually worried
about my mom

10:43.831 --> 10:45.965
'cause she's been
hurt before.

10:45.966 --> 10:47.867
This is all moving
way too fast.

10:47.901 --> 10:50.103
Wow.
Gina.

10:50.104 --> 10:51.237
That's really sweet.

10:51.238 --> 10:52.872
And the only reason
I didn't tell you guys

10:52.873 --> 10:54.574
is 'cause I don't
value you as people,

10:54.575 --> 10:56.509
so it's, like,
why be honest?

10:56.543 --> 10:58.378
Yeah, you just went back
and ruined what you said.

10:58.379 --> 10:59.545
Right.
Mm-hmm.

10:59.546 --> 11:02.048
Look, I know I'm
a stage five player,

11:02.049 --> 11:04.284
just mowing down chicks
left and right,

11:04.285 --> 11:05.919
but my dad's not like that.

11:05.953 --> 11:07.620
He would never hurt
your mom.

11:07.621 --> 11:10.757
Just talk to him,
you'll see.

11:10.758 --> 11:12.559
Fine.
I'll talk to him.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.093
Just to ask him
some questions.

11:14.094 --> 11:15.495
But go get him
before I change my mind.

11:15.529 --> 11:16.529
Okay.
Okay.

11:16.530 --> 11:18.431
Oh.
I already changed my mind.

11:18.432 --> 11:19.999
Aww.
All right, I'm back.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.834
Oh.
Oh. I'm back.

11:21.835 --> 11:24.370
<i>(Geoffrey) After that, the judge just
threw it out on the spot.</i>

11:24.371 --> 11:26.739
[all laughing]

11:26.740 --> 11:29.208
That judge has
a deep voice, right?

11:29.209 --> 11:31.844
I'm gonna go, uh,
check out the food.

11:31.845 --> 11:33.313
Hey.

11:33.314 --> 11:34.714
Bet you five buck
you can't guess

11:34.715 --> 11:39.152
three of the hors d'oeuvres
they're serving.

11:39.153 --> 11:41.054
I'll take that action.

11:41.088 --> 11:42.422
Chicken satay,

11:42.423 --> 11:43.990
tuna tartare,

11:43.991 --> 11:45.692
shot glasses
of gazpacho.

11:45.726 --> 11:48.528
Satay, tartare...

11:48.529 --> 11:50.496
no 'szpach.

11:50.497 --> 11:52.599
Where the 'szpach,
Hoytsman?

11:52.600 --> 11:54.868
Yes!
'Szpach!

11:54.869 --> 11:57.604
No!
Well played.

11:57.605 --> 11:58.805
Unless you want
to go double or nothing.

11:58.839 --> 12:01.708
I'm listening.

12:01.709 --> 12:05.411
<i>(Jake)
Oh, nothing but glass!</i>

12:05.412 --> 12:08.581
I'll bet you can't tell
how tall the Sarge is.

12:08.616 --> 12:10.250
In eggrolls.

12:10.284 --> 12:15.121
24.
Exactly 25 eggrolls tall.

12:15.122 --> 12:16.823
Celebration eggroll.

12:16.824 --> 12:18.291
Hey, man,
that was on the floor.

12:18.325 --> 12:19.959
You're on the floor.

12:19.994 --> 12:22.362
60 bucks says you can't
remove one glass

12:22.363 --> 12:24.497
without knocking
the whole thing over.

12:24.498 --> 12:30.069
You didn't say
I couldn't grab the top one.

12:30.070 --> 12:32.272
[glass shattering]

12:32.306 --> 12:33.506
Yes!

12:33.507 --> 12:36.242
100 bucks says I can jump
from the roof and survive.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.978
Oh, I don't think
you can...

12:38.979 --> 12:40.747
[chuckles]
Just messing with you, Peralta.

12:40.748 --> 12:42.415
I gotta hit the head.
Oh, then we'll bet on

12:42.416 --> 12:43.550
who can shove more shrimp
in his mouth.

12:43.551 --> 12:45.051
You're on.
I got a big mouth though.

12:45.052 --> 12:46.519
You're in trouble.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.887
I thought you
were leaving.

12:47.888 --> 12:49.022
Were you just talking
to Hoytsman?

12:49.056 --> 12:51.257
Talking. Bonding.
Betting.

12:51.258 --> 12:53.726
Oh, I should bet him that I can
pee for longer than he can.

12:53.727 --> 12:56.162
Ugh.
The trick is to pinch it.

12:56.163 --> 12:57.230
All right.
I'll be right back.

12:57.231 --> 13:01.935
Oh.
Gotta fill up the tank.

13:01.969 --> 13:03.803
Ah!
Hello Geoffrey.

13:03.838 --> 13:05.338
Hello.

13:05.372 --> 13:08.975
And that's cocaine.

13:10.704 --> 13:12.272
This night is making me
incredibly anxious.

13:12.306 --> 13:14.107
Oh hey,
Stay close.

13:14.108 --> 13:15.642
Someone messed with
the champagne tower.

13:15.643 --> 13:16.676
You're all I've got.

13:16.710 --> 13:19.212
Jake is stupid,
but he's smart.

13:19.213 --> 13:20.947
I think his plan
is actually working.

13:20.981 --> 13:24.284
Oh God.
Hey, so,

13:24.285 --> 13:26.753
No big deal,
but I arrested your boss,

13:26.754 --> 13:27.787
and I never should have
come here.

13:27.821 --> 13:29.088
Well I read that
wrong.

13:29.089 --> 13:31.324
Oh, this is insane.
This is so insane.

13:31.325 --> 13:32.925
I wasn't doing anything.

13:32.926 --> 13:34.127
He was snorting cocaine
in the bathroom.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.663
Okay, for the last time,
that is not what happened.

13:36.664 --> 13:39.265
And that's cocaine.

13:39.266 --> 13:41.401
Are you sure?
[chuckles]

13:41.402 --> 13:43.002
Five dollars
says you're wrong.

13:43.003 --> 13:44.437
Let me get in there.
Take a good look and smell.

13:44.471 --> 13:46.339
No, don't.
[groans]

13:46.340 --> 13:48.107
Okay.
It was cocaine.

13:48.108 --> 13:49.976
Turns out I was accidentally
doing some cocaine.

13:50.010 --> 13:51.144
Not on accident.

13:51.145 --> 13:52.745
You put it in your nose
on purpose.

13:52.746 --> 13:55.014
I don't even think
I have a nose, Peralta.

13:55.015 --> 13:57.016
I certainly cannot
feel it.

13:57.017 --> 13:58.051
The defense rests!

13:58.085 --> 13:59.652
Shh.
Keep your voices down.

13:59.687 --> 14:00.687
What is going on here?

14:00.721 --> 14:01.888
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

14:01.889 --> 14:04.891
Sophia's cop boyfriend
is arresting me

14:04.925 --> 14:06.793
in front of my friends
and colleagues.

14:06.827 --> 14:11.631
Hey, everyone.
I'm Jake.

14:11.632 --> 14:15.902
So who here saw
<i>12 Years A Slave?</i>

14:15.936 --> 14:17.637
Best picture.

14:17.671 --> 14:19.505
<i>(Holt)
Well, Diaz,</i>

14:19.540 --> 14:20.573
the deed is done.

14:20.608 --> 14:22.041
You torpedoed
her promotion?

14:22.076 --> 14:23.376
Sadly, no.

14:23.377 --> 14:26.079
I gave that goblin
a good recommendation.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.548
Your story about the marketer
really hit me.

14:28.549 --> 14:30.617
I began to realize
that if even you thought

14:30.618 --> 14:32.352
I should take the high road,
that was probably

14:32.353 --> 14:33.486
the right choice.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.355
I'm sorry you didn't
get your vengeance.

14:35.356 --> 14:37.624
Mother Holt.
Good one.

14:37.625 --> 14:40.460
But I am still planning
to get some retribution.

14:40.461 --> 14:43.429
I got her
a parting gift.

14:43.430 --> 14:45.431
Tickets to <i> Wicked?</i>

14:45.432 --> 14:46.933
In Boston.

14:46.934 --> 14:48.268
She's moving to
a second-class city,

14:48.302 --> 14:50.603
and I wanted
to rub her nose in it.

14:50.604 --> 14:52.338
Enjoy the understudies,
Madeline.

14:52.339 --> 14:54.741
Have fun watching
some chubby Chenoweth knock-off

14:54.742 --> 14:59.145
warble her way
through <i> Popular.</i>

14:59.146 --> 15:00.547
Hello, Lynn.

15:00.548 --> 15:01.681
Hi, Regina.

15:01.682 --> 15:03.349
Don't play games
with me, boy.

15:03.350 --> 15:05.185
This is a bad idea.

15:05.186 --> 15:06.786
No, it's okay.
Dad's got this.

15:06.787 --> 15:08.154
He's a real
sweet talker.

15:08.189 --> 15:09.822
Let's cut the crap.

15:09.823 --> 15:12.158
Okay.
What are your intentions with my mother?

15:12.193 --> 15:15.028
To make love to her
every morning until we die.

15:15.062 --> 15:17.096
So it's just physical?

15:17.097 --> 15:18.431
What are you nuts?

15:18.465 --> 15:20.066
I'm a divorced,
retired florist

15:20.067 --> 15:21.367
with a terrible
gluten allergy.

15:21.402 --> 15:25.371
Your mom is a beautiful,
brilliant travel agent.

15:25.372 --> 15:26.940
She talks to people
on the phone

15:26.941 --> 15:28.575
who've seen
the whole world.

15:28.609 --> 15:30.743
I'll never meet anyone
half as good as her.

15:30.778 --> 15:32.712
She's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

15:32.746 --> 15:36.082
You mean other
than Charles?

15:36.083 --> 15:37.350
No.

15:37.351 --> 15:39.319
She's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

15:39.353 --> 15:41.621
That's okay, Pop.

15:41.622 --> 15:43.223
You did what you had
to do.

15:43.257 --> 15:44.457
I love her.

15:44.458 --> 15:47.560
All I want is to make
her happy forever.

15:47.561 --> 15:49.696
Fine.
I give you my blessing.

15:49.697 --> 15:52.198
But if you hurt my mom
in any way,

15:52.199 --> 15:54.200
so help me God,
I will cut off

15:54.201 --> 15:55.502
your son's testicles.

15:55.503 --> 15:57.670
Snip, snip, snip.
And I'm not playing.

15:57.705 --> 15:59.806
Deal.

15:59.807 --> 16:00.807
[chuckles]

16:00.808 --> 16:02.342
Way to go, Dad!

16:02.343 --> 16:03.610
You bagged a babe.
[gasps]

16:03.611 --> 16:05.678
The Boyle boys
are planning a wedding!

16:05.713 --> 16:07.480
Boyle boys!
Boyle boys!

16:07.515 --> 16:09.816
Both: Boyle boys!
Boyle boys!

16:09.817 --> 16:12.118
Both: [laughing]

16:12.153 --> 16:13.853
You screwed this up,
buddy.

16:13.854 --> 16:15.688
You thinks she's gonna
still love you after this?

16:15.723 --> 16:16.923
She'll see who
you are now.

16:16.957 --> 16:18.992
Hey, you don't know anything
about me and Sophia.

16:19.026 --> 16:20.560
What?
I'm talking to myself

16:20.561 --> 16:21.828
about my wife.

16:21.829 --> 16:23.196
She is not gonna
like this.

16:23.197 --> 16:25.064
Who cares about you
and your gross life?

16:25.065 --> 16:27.100
Jake, heads up.

16:27.101 --> 16:29.636
Oh, hey, Sophia.
Thank God you're here.

16:29.637 --> 16:31.237
I was just gonna find you
so we could talk.

16:31.238 --> 16:32.605
Jake, I'm not here
to talk to you.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.706
I'm here
as Geoffrey's attorney.

16:33.707 --> 16:35.208
Oh, I can do it myself.
Watch this.

16:35.209 --> 16:37.575
Objection, objection, objection,
objection, objection!

16:37.578 --> 16:39.045
Five!
Five objections.

16:39.079 --> 16:42.182
Maybe this "cocaine"
isn't so bad after all.

16:42.183 --> 16:43.516
Okay.
Geoffrey, I'm gonna have to

16:43.517 --> 16:45.151
advise you to stop
talking/confessing

16:45.152 --> 16:46.286
in front
of the detectives.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.687
Okay, look,
I know that you're mad,

16:47.688 --> 16:50.256
but I talked to the D.A. and
he agreed to drop the charges.

16:50.257 --> 16:52.459
Geoffrey just had to do a little
bit of community service,

16:52.460 --> 16:53.993
and nothing will even go
on his record.

16:54.028 --> 16:55.295
Not good enough.
You have no evidence.

16:55.296 --> 16:57.831
Sophia, there's cocaine
on his collar right now.

16:57.832 --> 16:59.299
Oh, not anymore.
[inhales]

16:59.333 --> 17:00.800
Whoo!

17:00.835 --> 17:02.702
You're really not
reading the vibe right at all.

17:02.736 --> 17:03.937
Tell you what,
that's the cocaine.

17:03.938 --> 17:05.505
I'm usually very tuned in.

17:05.506 --> 17:07.006
Shh.
I had to arrest him.

17:07.007 --> 17:08.540
I had no choice.
Really?

17:08.576 --> 17:10.076
'Cause I could think
of 50 other ways

17:10.077 --> 17:11.310
you could've handled
this scenario.

17:11.345 --> 17:13.046
Oh my God,
you are such a lawyer.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.414
You are such a cop.

17:14.415 --> 17:16.182
I tell you I need some space
to figure things out

17:16.183 --> 17:17.550
and you come kicking
down the door

17:17.550 --> 17:19.352
with the first plan
that pops into your head.

17:19.353 --> 17:20.787
How is it my fault
that your jerk boss

17:20.788 --> 17:22.655
put his jerk nose
into a pile of jerk cocaine?

17:22.690 --> 17:23.957
You followed him
into a bathroom

17:23.991 --> 17:25.992
at a party you weren't even
invited to.

17:25.992 --> 17:28.060
Hey, you know what?
We're done.

17:28.061 --> 17:29.596
All right, fine.
I'll talk to the D.A.

17:29.597 --> 17:31.364
I'll see if I can cut
the community service in half,

17:31.365 --> 17:33.466
how's that?
No, Jake. Not with the case.

17:33.467 --> 17:35.769
You and I are done.

17:38.419 --> 17:40.253
[Jake panting]

17:40.254 --> 17:41.421
Jake, what are
you doing?

17:41.422 --> 17:42.456
I wanted to stop you.

17:42.490 --> 17:45.258
Grand gesture.
I took the stairs.

17:45.259 --> 17:46.593
A little winded there, buddy?
Yeah.

17:46.627 --> 17:48.528
Romance is hard!

17:48.529 --> 17:49.996
Can you just talk for,
like, 20 minutes

17:49.997 --> 17:51.064
while I catch my breath?

17:51.098 --> 17:52.332
I don't have anything
to say.

17:52.366 --> 17:53.400
Oh come on.

17:53.401 --> 17:54.968
This is just a stupid fight
about nothing.

17:54.969 --> 17:56.903
I'm not gonna let us
break up over this.

17:56.904 --> 17:58.105
Jake, our jobs
are incompatible.

17:58.106 --> 17:59.573
Our lives
are incompatible.

17:59.574 --> 18:01.108
Look, we'll just never
talk about work,

18:01.109 --> 18:02.576
or interact with
each other's friends,

18:02.577 --> 18:03.844
or acknowledge each other
in public,

18:03.845 --> 18:05.378
and I know this sounds like
I'm describing enemies,

18:05.379 --> 18:06.713
but we can
make this work.

18:06.714 --> 18:07.814
We're Romeo and Juliet.

18:07.849 --> 18:09.616
It didn't work
for Romeo and Juliet.

18:09.617 --> 18:11.918
That play ends in a tragic
double suicide.

18:11.953 --> 18:13.086
That's how it ends?

18:13.087 --> 18:14.221
Why do people
like it so much?

18:14.222 --> 18:16.490
All right, look.
Jake, you're fun, okay?

18:16.491 --> 18:17.824
And we've only been dating
for three months.

18:17.825 --> 18:19.693
It's just not that serious.

18:19.694 --> 18:21.294
Well, it's kinda
serious to me.

18:21.295 --> 18:22.662
I've accidentally said,
"I love you," like,

18:22.663 --> 18:23.630
four times already.

18:23.664 --> 18:25.031
I know.
I-

18:25.032 --> 18:27.000
I just don't think
I accidentally love you back.

18:27.034 --> 18:30.771
Look, it's just... it's just
so much work.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.773
That's work I'm willing
to do.

18:32.807 --> 18:35.475
I'm not.

18:35.510 --> 18:37.144
I'm sorry.

18:42.917 --> 18:44.918
Double suicide?

18:46.654 --> 18:47.954
<i>(Holt)
Hello, Madeline.</i>

18:47.955 --> 18:50.357
Raymond.
I was just about to call you.

18:50.358 --> 18:52.025
I wanted to thank you
for your kind recommendation.

18:52.060 --> 18:54.628
And I wanted
to give you this.

18:54.662 --> 18:57.164
<i>Wicked.</i>

18:57.165 --> 18:59.132
Starring Beth Danube.

18:59.133 --> 19:01.001
Well played, Raymond.

19:01.035 --> 19:02.969
Sadly, I won't be able
to use them.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.038
Since I'm not going to Boston.
What?

19:05.039 --> 19:07.674
I was only interested
in the Boston offer as leverage.

19:07.675 --> 19:10.143
I used it to get
a promotion from the NYPD.

19:10.144 --> 19:12.312
I have never had more power
over you

19:12.313 --> 19:13.980
than I do at this
very moment.

19:13.981 --> 19:17.117
I wanted to give you these
as a thank you.

19:17.118 --> 19:19.653
You're joking.

19:19.654 --> 19:20.654
I'm gonna call
the commissioner.

19:20.655 --> 19:23.390
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

19:23.424 --> 19:24.725
I know you never
would have recommended me

19:24.726 --> 19:26.660
for that Boston post
if deep down

19:26.661 --> 19:29.129
you didn't think
I deserved the job.

19:36.838 --> 19:39.172
What the...

19:39.207 --> 19:41.208
A thank you round
of drinks

19:41.209 --> 19:43.944
and a toast to Amy.
Oh.

19:43.945 --> 19:45.779
Your conflict
resolution skills

19:45.780 --> 19:47.914
has made my childhood dreams
come true.

19:47.915 --> 19:49.116
I'm gonna be
a ring bearer.

19:49.117 --> 19:50.751
You don't think your dad
will make you best man?

19:50.785 --> 19:53.553
Oh, I just assumed
he'd ask Jake.

19:53.554 --> 19:57.057
Mm. Move over, please.
I do have a wedding to plan.

19:57.058 --> 19:58.425
'Cause if this thing
is happening,

19:58.426 --> 20:00.360
it's not going to be
a Boyle brothers event.

20:00.395 --> 20:02.262
For starters,
all the bridesmaids

20:02.263 --> 20:03.563
are gonna be dressed
like Roseanne

20:03.564 --> 20:05.198
from the television show,
<i>Roseanne.</i>

20:05.199 --> 20:06.266
Oh, I like that show.

20:06.267 --> 20:08.402
A certified shaman
will conduct the ceremony,

20:08.403 --> 20:12.039
and the ring bearer
will be an actual wolf.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.341
Oh man, I could do it,
but I wouldn't be as majestic

20:14.342 --> 20:15.509
on all fours.

20:15.510 --> 20:16.877
This wedding sounds weird.
I'm into it.

20:16.878 --> 20:18.578
To Lynn and Darlene Boyle.

20:18.613 --> 20:20.180
All: Cheers.

20:20.181 --> 20:22.049
Yuck.

20:22.050 --> 20:24.317
My lady left me.

20:24.318 --> 20:26.086
My lady stayed.

20:26.087 --> 20:27.287
Come on, sir.

20:27.288 --> 20:28.555
Focus on the good.

20:28.556 --> 20:30.157
You can hold your head up:

20:30.158 --> 20:31.992
you took the high road
with Wuntch.

20:32.026 --> 20:33.360
Not entirely.

20:33.361 --> 20:35.963
When I was alone in her office,
I changed her auto-correct.

20:35.964 --> 20:39.599
Now when she types "Wuntch,"
it gets replaced with "Butt."

20:39.634 --> 20:42.602
Ah, I should not have gone
to that party.

20:42.603 --> 20:43.837
I shouldn't have gone
to that bathroom.

20:43.838 --> 20:45.405
I should not have
arrested her boss.

20:45.406 --> 20:46.807
I don't see it that way.

20:46.808 --> 20:49.076
You did everything right.
You were a good cop.

20:49.077 --> 20:50.544
Good lonely cop.

20:50.545 --> 20:52.512
Hey, man, you put yourself
out there.

20:52.513 --> 20:53.647
You weren't breezy.

20:53.648 --> 20:56.350
You like Sophia,
you fought for her.

20:56.351 --> 20:57.517
You should be proud.

20:57.518 --> 20:59.419
No, you should be
changing her auto-correct.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.554
What's her last name?

21:00.555 --> 21:01.922
Perez.
No.

21:01.923 --> 21:03.023
It's "Butt" now.

21:03.024 --> 21:04.992
Sophia Butt.

21:04.993 --> 21:07.027
That's feels good,
doesn't it?

21:07.028 --> 21:08.128
Not really.

21:08.129 --> 21:10.163
Okay.

21:10.164 --> 21:11.331
Then let's get soused.

21:11.332 --> 21:13.033
Ah, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

21:13.034 --> 21:15.235
Mine.
Mine.
