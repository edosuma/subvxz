00:06.006 --> 00:07.924
-Ah!
- She looks excited!

00:08.008 --> 00:11.052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.347
It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.349
-Oh!

00:16.433 --> 00:19.019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.567
Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

00:26.109 --> 00:28.028
Hello, I'm MarieÂ Kondo.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.279
My mission

00:29.362 --> 00:32.741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
Ching!

00:34.242 --> 00:36.995
<i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:41.583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

00:41.666 --> 00:43.334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

00:43.501 --> 00:45.253
The KonMari Method is unique

00:45.336 --> 00:48.256
<i>because I organize by category,</i>
<i>rather than by</i> location.

00:48.339 --> 00:51.718
In the KonMari Method, we tidy
five categories in a specific order.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.386
First, is clothing.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.264
I can't reach.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.849
Next, is books.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.852
Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.479
Then, paper.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.439
I can't do the papers.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:12.614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

01:12.697 --> 01:13.740
and garage.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.868
Everything miscellaneous.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.163
Finally, sentimental items.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.212
This is kinda hard.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.554
<i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:38.473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.767
She wants to see this place turned around.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.313
This is amazing.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.440
You're so cute! I love you!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.734
You're so cute.
I love you, too.
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.959
<i>You didn't see me</i>
<i>wash my hands before,</i>

02:06.042 --> 02:07.961
but I want you to know
I washed my hands before.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.420
- Okay. Good.
-Okay.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.005
In case you were worried about that.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.006
<i>Hi, my name's Frank,</i>

02:12.090 --> 02:16.761
and I have lived in this happy home
for a little over two years now.

02:17.345 --> 02:20.849
My name is Matt and I have lived here
a little over three years.

02:20.932 --> 02:24.269
Oh, so it's not a happy home for you.
Okay. Alright. Cool.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.940
Thanks!

02:29.023 --> 02:31.860
I can never find
the spice that I want, ever.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.989
Do you have any idea what artichokes
look like when they're done?

02:36.072 --> 02:38.616
They're just tender.
I don't know what they look like.

02:39.784 --> 02:42.203
We are a classic love story.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.998
We opened an app and swiped right.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.333
-Mm-hmm.
-And that's, uh, how we met.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.419
<i>And Matt moved fast.</i>

02:49.502 --> 02:52.088
<i>It was like, "Let's go on a date,"</i>
<i>and I'm like, "Okay, sure."</i>

02:52.172 --> 02:54.632
<i>We went to this bar near my house</i>

02:54.716 --> 02:56.009
and Matt goes to the bathroom,

02:56.092 --> 02:58.595
he comes back and I'm like,
"Oh, do you want a second drink?"

02:58.678 --> 03:01.139
He just grabbed my face and kisses me,
and I was like,

03:01.222 --> 03:03.766
"Okay, okay."

03:04.350 --> 03:06.769
<i>So we go back to my place</i>
<i>on Friday night.</i>

03:07.270 --> 03:09.898
<i>Matt does not leave until Monday morning.</i>

03:09.981 --> 03:13.484
<i>We keep canceling everything we have</i>
<i>so we can hang out with each other.</i>

03:13.776 --> 03:17.822
<i>So, at the end of this 62-hour date,</i>
<i>we have said, "I love you,"</i>

03:17.906 --> 03:20.158
<i>and said that we want to be</i>
<i>in a relationship</i>

03:20.241 --> 03:21.743
<i>and stay together forever.</i>

03:22.160 --> 03:23.453
For those keeping score at home,

03:23.536 --> 03:26.539
this was after three dates
and a week and a half of dating.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.583
We're still here three years later, so...

03:33.755 --> 03:36.466
- So, I talked to my mom...
- Mm-hmm?

03:36.841 --> 03:39.135
But what do we have to do
before they get here?

03:39.219 --> 03:40.261
Um...

03:41.221 --> 03:44.224
I don't know, just make
the place look presentable would be nice.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.184
-That's a good start.

03:46.267 --> 03:49.520
My parents have not visited me
in California since I moved here,

03:49.604 --> 03:51.022
actually, five years ago.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.442
I love my family,
but I'm also really nervous

03:54.525 --> 03:56.736
for them to come visit because...

03:57.153 --> 03:58.947
<i>if you were to walk through our home,</i>

03:59.030 --> 04:01.407
<i>you'd think</i>
<i>that college students live here.</i>

04:01.491 --> 04:03.534
<i>We very rarely make the bed.</i>

04:05.536 --> 04:08.373
<i>Between us,</i>
<i>we accumulate a lot of stuff.</i>

04:08.456 --> 04:11.668
<i>I feel like both of us have things</i>
<i>from our college days</i>

04:11.751 --> 04:13.253
<i>that are in our closets.</i>

04:13.336 --> 04:16.381
Yours I'm more worried about.
Yours has melted cough drops on the floor.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.134
Oh! That one came up. That's good.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.011
-Busted!
-Busted!

04:22.512 --> 04:23.763
I'm proud of our place,

04:23.846 --> 04:27.183
but it definitely can use
that extra oomph.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.061
It's just not quite there. And, I yeah...

04:30.603 --> 04:32.981
And I want it to be
before your parents get here.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.067
Our home is
a reflection of our relationship.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.069
<i>So if our home isn't in harmony,</i>

04:38.152 --> 04:41.281
<i>I feel like they might worry</i>
<i>that this might be just temporary.</i>

04:41.364 --> 04:42.865
-So...
-Yeah, I could see that.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.243
It'd be nice if it looked nice for them,
for sure.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.912
<i>My parents, they've met Matt,</i>
<i>they love him,</i>

04:47.996 --> 04:50.707
<i>but just to see that, like,</i>
<i>the life we've created together</i>

04:50.790 --> 04:52.625
<i>is something to be, like, admired.</i>

04:53.042 --> 04:55.044
I think if they take our home seriously,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.005
they'll be taking
our relationship seriously,

04:57.088 --> 04:59.340
and that's what we want,
to make sure they know this is...

04:59.799 --> 05:02.635
We're gonna be here for a while
and we're gonna be together forever.

05:03.469 --> 05:07.932
Tidying not only changes
your home or life,

05:08.474 --> 05:11.477
but it also allows you to create a space
that suits your ideal self.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.604
Frank and Matt are

05:13.688 --> 05:17.942
a young couple wanting to live
a more mature lifestyle.

05:18.026 --> 05:22.822
I am so happy to be able to support them
during their transition into adulthood.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.804
-Hello.
-Hi.

05:46.888 --> 05:47.805
Nice to meet you!

05:47.889 --> 05:50.600
-Very nice to meet you.
-Hi, I'm Iida, Miss Marie's interpreter

05:50.683 --> 05:52.727
-Sure, nice to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.354
-I'm Frank, this is Matt.
-Ah!

05:54.437 --> 05:56.397
-Hello!
-Hi.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.487
-It's very clean in here.

06:02.945 --> 06:03.988
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.033
-We wanted it to look clean for you.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.120
So I'd love to get a little bit of a tour
of your space.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.413
-Of course.
-That'd be great.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.040
So, this is our living room.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.292
We, uh, watch a lot of TV.

06:16.876 --> 06:20.380
-We have all our board games here.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.091
Yeah, and some pictures,
postcards, and stuff.

06:23.174 --> 06:26.469
Some books and we also have
all our DVDs are here...

06:26.552 --> 06:28.846
-...on those shelves with some books.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.183
<i>Every space I've ever had,</i>
<i>my parents referred to as a college dorm.</i>

06:32.266 --> 06:35.520
<i>And so I don't know that I've given them</i>
<i>every reason to, like,</i>

06:35.812 --> 06:37.355
<i>respect me as an adult.</i>

06:37.647 --> 06:40.191
That's why I really want the place to...

06:40.733 --> 06:43.403
look like someplace they can trust me
as an adult to live in.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.822
And I want them to see, like,
we've got a handle on it.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.116
-Mm-hmm.
-We're good, you raised us right.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.660
Well, me, they didn't raise you.
But, yeah.

06:52.161 --> 06:53.996
I write at the desk a lot.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.791
I'm a writer, too, so I usually,
will be just working here.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.876
This is my sort of station here.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.004
What kind of writer are you?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.589
I'm a TV comedy writer.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.468
Do you guys work together?
You're-- As a pair?

07:07.552 --> 07:09.470
-Yeah. No. No.

07:09.554 --> 07:13.057
I don't know if we want to put
that tension on our relationship.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.645
-Still very neat here.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.564
Oh, no. It'll get worse.
It'll get worse.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.275
Okay. Well, before you decide that, um,

07:22.358 --> 07:26.946
so we only have one closet in our bedroom,
so my closet's right here.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.117
Yeah. Take a look. Please, go right ahead.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.371
-Ah!

07:35.872 --> 07:38.124
Yeah. Feel free. There isn't...

07:38.207 --> 07:40.960
Seems to be a lot of things
stuffed deep in there.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.045
-There's a world in there, yeah.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.714
- Wow, it's so deep.
-Yeah.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.425
I see there's a place to hang
clothes all the way in the back.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.635
- Yep, that there is.
-Oh, wow! Okay.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.147
Oh, wow. Look how deep it goes.
Yeah. Oh, my goodness!

08:02.523 --> 08:04.525
In terms of storage space,
this is very nice.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.280
So most of your clothes, Frank,
are in here?

08:09.363 --> 08:12.783
In the room there is still a dresser
where I have, like, a lot of other stuff.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.204
-Okay, the rest of the theâ¦
-Sure, yeah.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.706
So, next, we have
the kitchen in here.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.001
Our pantry is open,
so you can kind of see the chaos.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.128
This is where we keep our dishes.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.008
I see a little bit of clutter now.
Okay. Okay.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.637
I think the kitchen might be
our most disorganized area.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.554
-For sure.
-Yeah.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.848
<i>We'd accumulated stuff</i>
<i>over the years</i>

08:35.932 --> 08:37.975
<i>because we had roommates come and go</i>

08:38.059 --> 08:39.727
<i>and some people just left their stuff.</i>

08:39.810 --> 08:42.688
<i>I hate the kitchen. I get out</i>
<i>of the kitchen as fast as possible.</i>

08:42.772 --> 08:46.901
-And he loves food, so that's actually...
-So that's-- that's been hard.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.861
Somebody who loves food
to just grab it and go.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.447
He just runs into the kitchen
and grabs the snack and runs out.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.199
Yeah, you'd think there were an egg timer,

08:53.282 --> 08:55.701
and the floor would collapse
in a certain amount of time.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.953
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.041
- I'm already getting a vision...

09:02.124 --> 09:04.126
...of how better its going to be.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.045
So, I'm getting very excited.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.339
And then straight ahead
is the bedroom.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.760
These are Frank's drawers here.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.012
They're all very stuffed full.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.973
Uh, pants.

09:17.056 --> 09:20.268
And also there used to be lots
of documents in here that I just got rid.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.852
It was worse, if you can believe it.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.479
-Ah!

09:23.563 --> 09:24.730
What about this?

09:24.814 --> 09:27.567
- Closet. It's pretty bad.
- Closet.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.779
- So, how is this separated?
-Well, this is just mine.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.907
I'm the baby of my family,
so I think I've always been given

09:34.991 --> 09:37.743
a little bit of slack
when it comes to, like, chores.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.620
<i>Definitely kept a messy room.</i>

09:39.704 --> 09:41.163
<i>I rarely made my bed,</i>

09:41.247 --> 09:45.167
<i>which might be part of the reason</i>
<i>why I am so cluttered right now.</i>

09:45.251 --> 09:47.378
<i>I didn't really learn those good habits.</i>

09:47.461 --> 09:49.130
But I've been the baby long enough

09:49.213 --> 09:52.008
and I kind of need to move onto
that next stage.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.428
Although those socks are mine
that you're seeing right in front of you.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.096
Ah!

09:57.179 --> 09:59.932
So, Frank, do you always
reach in here and get your socks?

10:00.474 --> 10:03.060
This is new.
I used to have them in here, but--

10:03.144 --> 10:06.647
It was an attempt to de-clutter this,
but it, uh... yeah.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.983
<i>Growing up, whenever my mom</i>
<i>asked me to clean,</i>

10:09.066 --> 10:12.153
I would just shove a bunch of paper
in my desk and be like, "It's clean."

10:12.236 --> 10:14.488
And that's sort of
what we've done with our closets.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.906
<i>They're overflowing.</i>

10:15.990 --> 10:18.909
<i>There is some closets</i>
<i>we haven't looked at for a long time.</i>

10:19.118 --> 10:21.871
<i>I'm organized in some aspects of my life,</i>
<i>like professionally.</i>

10:21.954 --> 10:23.539
<i>my email inbox is organized. I'm great.</i>

10:23.623 --> 10:25.875
And I just, like,
get frustrated with myself

10:25.958 --> 10:28.044
that I haven't translated that
into into my home life.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.713
It feels like I give it all at work
and I come home and I'm like--

10:34.467 --> 10:36.177
First thing I wanted to ask was

10:36.260 --> 10:40.890
why the two of you felt that you wanted
to go on this tidying journey with me?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.393
I think that we both have felt
that it's a little bit

10:44.477 --> 10:46.854
dorm-like, it's a little bit adolescent.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.815
And I think in particular is you saw
we're good at hiding things

10:49.899 --> 10:51.651
that aren't organized,
so to the outside world

10:51.734 --> 10:53.611
people walk in, and say,
"What's wrong with it?

10:53.694 --> 10:56.072
But, like, we know what we aren't liking.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.117
Has your friends
or family often visit here?
My parents have come around
a couple of times,

11:02.828 --> 11:05.081
but your parents haven't visited at all.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.248
They are coming next month,

11:06.332 --> 11:08.959
so it's especially important
to me to, like,

11:09.043 --> 11:12.046
make the home someplace
that they feel, uh,

11:12.129 --> 11:15.341
welcome as guests and not just as parents
who have to, like,

11:15.424 --> 11:18.010
reorganize or clean or anything.
I want them to just to be here,

11:18.094 --> 11:21.222
have a nice experience, and then go back
to where they came from.

11:21.305 --> 11:24.642
<i>I don't feel actively judged</i>
<i>by my parents, but that being said,</i>

11:24.725 --> 11:27.812
<i>I do feel like I have thrown them</i>
<i>a few curve balls.</i>

11:27.895 --> 11:30.064
<i>I didn't go to medical school.</i>

11:30.898 --> 11:33.901
I am in a gay relationship and...

11:34.735 --> 11:35.569
um...

11:42.827 --> 11:44.745
I don't know why
I'm getting worked up about this.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.956
They're very loving people, but, uh,...

11:47.039 --> 11:50.376
you know, I don't know
that I've always, uh...

11:53.045 --> 11:56.340
It's probably just in me again feeling
like I haven't always made them proud.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.926
<i>I'm sure every kid</i>
<i>goes through that, being like,</i>

11:59.009 --> 12:02.680
<i>"Oh, have I, like, justified my parents</i>
<i>having me and all the expenses."</i>

12:02.763 --> 12:05.808
<i>But, yeah, I want them to see this home</i>
<i>and feel really like,</i>

12:05.891 --> 12:08.185
<i>"We did everything we could for this kid</i>

12:08.269 --> 12:11.772
<i>and he's really taken on everything</i>
<i>we taught him and...</i>

12:11.856 --> 12:12.732
we love him."

12:12.815 --> 12:15.359
It'd mean a lot for them to really be...

12:16.736 --> 12:18.404
...come in here
and see all that

12:18.487 --> 12:19.864
that I'm feeling about this place.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.326
I-- And that's a lot of a meaning
to attribute to a home, but...

12:24.744 --> 12:25.911
it has that for me.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.587
Before we start, I want to first
introduce myself to the home.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.130
If that's okay.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.716
This is a ritual that I do
before we begin.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.719
I think this will do.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.227
So, while I introduce myself,

12:50.311 --> 12:52.772
I would love for you to picture
your vision for your home.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.383
Okay. Very good.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.179
Very good. Thank you so much.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.645
How did you feel
communicating with the home?

13:32.728 --> 13:35.731
I think more so than anything
when I was concentrating,

13:35.815 --> 13:37.817
there was, like, a feeling I had of, like,

13:38.234 --> 13:40.653
just joy of, like, people walking through,

13:40.736 --> 13:43.113
me being happy with how it was,
us being happy.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.866
It's like I want to get that feeling.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.537
It's very important
to have a vision

13:49.620 --> 13:52.248
and to communicate the vision
to your home.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.668
It allows the rest of the process
to go much more smoothly.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.712
So, ready?

13:59.296 --> 14:00.881
-Yeah.
-As ready as we're gonna be.

14:06.887 --> 14:10.099
Just around here.
Just keep it together as much as possible.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.183
-Yeah.
- Almost done.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.143
-Okay. That's it.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.146
- Very good. Well done!

14:16.230 --> 14:18.816
What do you think looking at
all the clothes that you own?

14:18.899 --> 14:20.776
There's so many I don't wear or need.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.238
Definitely looks like a lot more
when I see it piled in one place.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.032
So what we'll be doing

14:27.116 --> 14:29.660
is you'll be going through all
of your clothes one by one

14:29.743 --> 14:33.330
and selecting only the clothes
that spark joy for you.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.957
What does "spark joy" mean for you?

14:37.126 --> 14:40.379
Oh, for me "spark joy" is all about
how my body reacts.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.465
So when you hold an item in your hands
that sparks joy for you,

14:43.549 --> 14:45.301
this is how your body should react.

14:45.509 --> 14:46.635
-Ching!

14:46.719 --> 14:48.721
-Do you understand?
-Yeah. Yeah.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.307
The cute sound that she made
that I'm not gonna translate.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.854
Is there anything that you see
in here that clearly sparks joy for you?

14:56.937 --> 14:59.106
-Yes, definitely.
- Let's try touching that.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.487
That is really cute.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.743
You also should envision
as you go through the selection process.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.871
Like, what do you see yourself wearing
that will make you feel

15:13.954 --> 15:16.832
more mature and grown-up?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.459
So before I visit next time,

15:18.542 --> 15:20.878
please finish,
complete all of your clothes.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.673
This feels like kinda like the last step
to get us to being adults.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.593
<i>And I think we just need that last push.</i>

15:27.676 --> 15:30.304
<i>Like, that push out of the nest</i>
<i>that the mama bird does.</i>

15:30.387 --> 15:32.306
Hopefully Marie can be our mama bird.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.434
I've actually watched <i>Planet Earth,</i>
that doesn't actually happen.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.311
No bird pushes their children
out the nest.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.271
-You're ruining my metaphor.
-I am, but...

15:39.355 --> 15:41.357
but the point stands, uh, yeah.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.193
We need a last bit
of energy and we're gonna get it here.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.110
Uh-huh.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.029
-Thank you so much, guys.
-Thank you.

15:47.112 --> 15:47.947
Bye.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.324
-See you soon. Bye.
-See you soon.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.170
Do I like this? Eh...

16:03.921 --> 16:05.005
Thank you.

16:06.548 --> 16:10.761
See, I feel like I have more socks,
even in my yes collection than you.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.180
I didn't throw out that many,
though, in all honestly.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.723
I just guess I don't have as many.

16:16.725 --> 16:21.730
I'm having trouble connecting to the idea
of items of clothing sparking joy.

16:22.398 --> 16:26.527
See, so far this is everything
I'm keeping here.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.529
I've felt joy from all of it.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.991
<i>I definitely was</i>
<i>an over achiever at school.</i>

16:32.074 --> 16:35.828
Gotten As and I've always grasped
concepts really quickly.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.622
Didn't have to study like a super ton.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.208
<i>So when I'm not getting</i>
<i>the concept right away,</i>

16:41.291 --> 16:42.960
<i>it's kind of like a disconnect of, like...</i>

16:43.836 --> 16:47.673
Like, I'm usually good at this,
what am I-- what am I doing wrong?

16:47.756 --> 16:50.884
I have a few items
that really, like, speak to me,

16:50.968 --> 16:52.636
but then I have a lot that

16:52.720 --> 16:55.305
don't speak negatively,
but don't speak positively.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.099
I feel like are in-- in the in-between.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.602
My policy for that is sort of like
if the answer isn't yes, it's no.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.229
I know. That's what it should be.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.857
What I've noticed is the stuff
that sparks joy, like,

17:04.940 --> 17:08.652
I honestly have that like, "Oh!" reaction
that Marie was talking about.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.321
I do have it with some of my clothes,
but not...

17:11.947 --> 17:15.534
a lot, and that's why I'm not filtering
as well as you, probably.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.037
I'm not really listening to myself.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.665
<i>I'm not always</i>
<i>emotionally available.</i>

17:21.749 --> 17:23.500
<i>I'mÂ not the most emotional person.</i>

17:24.043 --> 17:27.004
<i>Ever since I've been little</i>
<i>I've been shy and, like,</i>

17:27.087 --> 17:30.090
<i>I've had a few close friends</i>
<i>that I'm really close with,</i>

17:30.174 --> 17:32.134
<i>but then everyone else, not so much.</i>

17:32.634 --> 17:35.929
<i>Sometimes I can seem cold</i>
<i>and a little bit distant to people,</i>

17:36.638 --> 17:40.392
<i>so kind of just opening up</i>
<i>as the process goes along</i>

17:40.476 --> 17:42.728
would be a good first
stepping stone to that.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.229
I think I need to...

17:45.355 --> 17:46.273
re-focus.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.984
I think I've gotten a little too--
a little bogged down

17:49.068 --> 17:51.153
and have become a little precious.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.322
Yeah, I feel like
if you're not sure, you keep it.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.074
Yeah. That's fair.

17:55.824 --> 17:58.368
When I get to the ties,
I might ask you to weigh in

17:58.452 --> 18:00.913
because I feel like you have
a good sense of color,

18:00.996 --> 18:05.125
and I don't want to throw away something
where I'm just inaccurately assessing

18:05.751 --> 18:07.169
what I can pair it with.

18:12.549 --> 18:17.346
Neckties are important
accessories for men.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.641
So let's store them with respect.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.537
Store neckties in boxes

18:42.371 --> 18:44.456
to keep them organized.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.888
- Hi!
-Hi!

19:03.308 --> 19:05.602
-Hi. Nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you again!
-Nice to see you.
-Good to see you!

19:08.063 --> 19:10.190
-Hi. Nice to see you.
-Hi. Good to see you.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.651
- Is that what I think it is?

19:12.734 --> 19:14.570
-What you're letting go?
- Yes.

19:14.653 --> 19:18.073
-That is a great amount. Very well done.

19:19.241 --> 19:22.161
And let's tackle the books
and paper categories next.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.078
-Yeah.
-Yes!

19:29.459 --> 19:34.089
So let's take out every single book
from the house and collect it in one spot.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.716
Is that yours? No, it's mine.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.849
So, the process is the same
with clothes.

19:43.932 --> 19:48.020
Take every single book into your hands
and see if it sparks joy for you.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.565
How do you fold the books, though?
I don't see how that works.

19:51.648 --> 19:54.234
Books, you don't fold.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.111
-You read them.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.534
But with books, you also want
to ask this question to yourself.

20:02.618 --> 20:06.496
By having these books, will it be
beneficial to your life going forward?

20:06.580 --> 20:09.374
<i>Books are the reflection</i>

20:09.458 --> 20:14.087
of our thoughts and values.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.465
<i>So by tidying books,</i>

20:16.548 --> 20:19.343
<i>it will show you what kind of information</i>

20:19.426 --> 20:22.554
is important to you at this moment.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.349
- Good over there, yeah.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.517
Which one is this? Spark joy or no?

20:27.601 --> 20:29.061
-Definitely, yes.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.646
-Okay.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.105
Thank you.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.690
Thank you.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.277
Thank you.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.706
Is this difficult for you,
going through the books?

20:49.790 --> 20:50.791
Uh...

20:51.416 --> 20:52.292
Yeah.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.629
I assume you always love to read.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.048
Uh, yeah, ever since I was a kid.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.842
Like, when the Scholastic Book Fair
would come to our school

21:00.926 --> 21:02.970
that was, like,
the biggest day of the year.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.391
What's your number one book
that you will never let go?

21:07.474 --> 21:09.142
-Is there such a book?
-I think...

21:09.935 --> 21:12.938
<i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i> really sparked
with me and connected

21:13.021 --> 21:15.023
back in high school when I first read it.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.944
- Will you try touching that for me?
- Mm-hmm.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.493
Yeah, definitely, like,

21:26.576 --> 21:29.746
I can remember reading it in high school
for the first time.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.082
Um, yeah,

21:32.165 --> 21:35.127
it's a def-- It's like a for sure,
like, just immediate.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.133
Books like that
are very useful for you

21:41.216 --> 21:43.719
because that's the spark of joy
that you should be feeling.

21:43.802 --> 21:44.636
Mm-hmm.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.515
<i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i>
really inspired me a lot.

21:48.598 --> 21:51.893
I still read it about once
every two years.

21:51.977 --> 21:52.978
Um...

21:53.186 --> 21:55.647
And, uh, I just...

21:55.731 --> 21:58.650
really connected to the characters
and it really inspired me

21:58.734 --> 22:00.652
to want to be a writer myself.

22:01.111 --> 22:04.573
Um, so when I hold this,
I kind of feel this warm sensation,

22:04.656 --> 22:09.036
<i>and it slowly dawned on me just, like,</i>

22:09.119 --> 22:10.996
"Oh, this is what you're supposed
to be feeling

22:11.079 --> 22:12.581
when you have that spark of joy."

22:12.914 --> 22:14.791
<i>The ones that I didn't feel connection to,</i>

22:14.875 --> 22:17.878
<i>it was immediately clear</i>
<i>that I was ready to let those ones go.</i>

22:19.421 --> 22:22.090
I think that you really honed
your sensitivity to joy

22:22.174 --> 22:23.800
through going through these books.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.635
-Yes.
-I definitely feel that way.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.347
I think with books I feel more
of a connection

22:28.430 --> 22:32.142
than I do with clothes, where I'm just
trying to, like, look decent,

22:32.225 --> 22:34.353
and I don't put that much energy into it.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.688
Where books I've spent the time with them,

22:36.772 --> 22:38.482
so I'm more connected to them.

22:38.565 --> 22:40.484
<i>The moment you realize what it means</i>

22:40.567 --> 22:43.570
to spark joy comes to people
at different times.

22:43.987 --> 22:48.241
As you continue to tidy,
your sensitivity to joy will be honed.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.535
So there will be an "aha" moment

22:50.619 --> 22:53.663
when you realize what it means
for something to spark joy.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.375
<i>So even though you decided</i>
<i>to keep items now,</i>

22:56.458 --> 22:58.460
<i>you may feel that you want to</i>

22:58.543 --> 23:02.547
revisit those items again
later on in the tidying process.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.050
I'm done, so...

23:05.133 --> 23:07.594
-All done. Oh, my goodness!

23:07.677 --> 23:09.596
You can move on to
the next category, actually.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.599
So can you make a pile of paper
on the dining room table?

23:12.682 --> 23:13.934
You bet I can.

23:14.017 --> 23:15.602
Thank you.

23:22.692 --> 23:23.777
And done.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.320
-Oh! Well done.
-Thank you.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.907
And now you can see Frank's paper mess
that he's just starting on.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.660
- Oh, and he's still going.
- I heard that!

23:31.743 --> 23:34.579
Frank does not let go of any papers.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.374
<i>He still has notes</i>
<i>from, like, high school,</i>

23:37.457 --> 23:41.294
<i>and he puts a lot of emotion</i>
<i>and memories in those notes.</i>

23:41.378 --> 23:42.671
I'm aware of my problem, I guess,

23:42.754 --> 23:44.589
because I see them stored
all over the house.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.967
<i>So I knew the amount was too high,</i>

23:47.050 --> 23:50.720
but in order to veil that from myself,
I increased the number of locations.

23:51.304 --> 23:54.099
I get very sentimental about cards.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.269
Yeah, well this one I'm keeping for sure.

23:57.352 --> 24:00.564
So this is, like, sort of history
into why I started writing.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.358
There was a bunch of, like,
<i>Power Rangers </i>fan fiction.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.734
- Ah!

24:04.818 --> 24:05.777
Scrap in here.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.948
How old were you
when you wrote those?

24:10.031 --> 24:12.784
So this goes back
from when I was a teenager to, like...

24:13.034 --> 24:14.703
this was just a couple years ago.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.583
<i>I have a great appreciation</i>
<i>for my childhood.</i>

24:19.666 --> 24:22.586
I grew up very happy in my house,
and as a result I've kept a lot

24:22.669 --> 24:26.506
<i>of like,Â you know, little drawings I had,</i>
<i>even from, like, age eight or something,</i>

24:26.590 --> 24:30.177
and I've kept those just for, like,
inspiration and comfort and warmth

24:30.260 --> 24:33.346
and I'm worried that, like,
I'll want to hang on to everything.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.349
I feel like for me,
this actually might be the hardest.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.645
Discovering what's
difficult for you

24:40.729 --> 24:43.148
is just the whole point
of this process, too,

24:43.231 --> 24:45.358
which is understanding what sparks joy.
It's the things that are
the most meaningful to you

24:47.652 --> 24:48.570
that are the hardest.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.198
He loves books
and I love just writing a lot, so...

24:54.034 --> 24:57.245
The trick to keeping
paper documents in order

24:57.329 --> 24:59.873
is to have a designated spot in the house.

25:04.461 --> 25:08.715
Papers you decide to keep
can be divided into three categories.

25:09.799 --> 25:12.677
The first category is pending documents.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.847
Pending documents are papers

25:15.931 --> 25:18.767
that are waitingÂ for you

25:18.850 --> 25:23.563
to take action upon,
such as letters and bills.

25:24.105 --> 25:27.609
The second category
is important documents.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.821
Important documents are papers

25:31.905 --> 25:36.034
that you need to keep  permanently,

25:36.117 --> 25:40.580
such as contracts and insurance forms.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.000
The last category is
miscellaneous documents.

25:45.085 --> 25:49.923
Miscellaneous documents are papers
that you refer to often,

25:50.006 --> 25:52.259
such as recipe cutouts from magazines,

25:52.342 --> 25:56.096
or papers from a seminar you attended

25:56.179 --> 26:01.851
that you frequently go back to read.

26:06.231 --> 26:09.150
Oh, boy. I wrote some
angsty songs in college.

26:10.777 --> 26:12.612
But, like, on a serious note,

26:12.696 --> 26:14.489
I think I started songwriting when I was,

26:14.573 --> 26:17.450
like, coming to terms with, like,
having gay feelings,

26:17.534 --> 26:19.869
and I didn't kinda get it yet.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.208
It got me through some hard times
writing songs, so, huh.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.502
You're ready to let that go?

26:27.586 --> 26:30.338
Part of me feels like I should save these.

26:30.797 --> 26:33.216
<i>I attribute a lot of emotional value</i>
<i>to papers,</i>

26:33.300 --> 26:36.094
like, because even today,
going through them, I was like,

26:36.177 --> 26:39.472
"Oh, this was the first script I wrote
that, like, did well in a competition.

26:39.556 --> 26:43.351
This is, like, when I first had
my creative inklings about this concept,"

26:43.435 --> 26:45.895
and so it's hard for me to let things go.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.065
That's funny.
Now I wonder if I should keep it.

26:52.819 --> 26:55.697
- I can't do the papers.
-They're all yours.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.867
I like papers. I've always liked papers.
-I just like...
-I think it's really just about

27:01.995 --> 27:07.542
what-- like, the ones that really you feel
like are particularly sparking your joy.

27:09.169 --> 27:13.298
I love Matt and want the best for him,
but, man,

27:13.381 --> 27:16.217
<i>there is like a total flip</i>
<i>from, like, clothing to papers</i>

27:16.301 --> 27:17.886
<i>that I was not anticipating.</i>

27:18.386 --> 27:21.097
<i>I totally understand</i>
<i>his frustration before,</i>

27:21.181 --> 27:24.893
and it doesn't feel good to be
the one at the back of the class.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.646
You want to feel like
you're really taking it on.

27:27.979 --> 27:31.066
I sorted the mail already,
so this is your new mail right here.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.901
-Great. Thank you, Matthew.
-Yep.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.277
-Appreciate this.
-You're welcome.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.457
-Hi.
-Hi!

27:47.540 --> 27:49.668
-Nice to see you.
-Hi, Marie. Nice to see you again.

27:49.751 --> 27:50.585
Come on in.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.046
-Oh, we have gifts! Exciting!
-Yes.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.465
Yes. We have a lot of boxes.

27:55.548 --> 27:57.092
Oh! Perfect. Okay.

27:59.427 --> 28:02.722
So today's category will be
miscellaneous items.

28:06.267 --> 28:07.560
<i>I'm a catastrophizer,</i>

28:07.644 --> 28:10.605
<i>and it means to prepare for</i>
<i>the worst case scenario doomsday,</i>

28:10.689 --> 28:12.399
<i>but, like, at all times.</i>

28:12.649 --> 28:15.485
Someone who catastrophizes,
it's a problem in your home

28:15.568 --> 28:17.278
because you think,
"What if I need this one?"

28:17.362 --> 28:19.280
You just sort of keep everything.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.615
<i>But then it's ultimately useless</i>

28:20.699 --> 28:22.909
<i>'cause you don't</i>
<i>remember where it is when you need it.</i>

28:25.328 --> 28:28.915
Do we have an earthquake kit
at all prepared?

28:28.998 --> 28:29.958
-No.

28:30.041 --> 28:33.420
No, nothing
that for an actual emergency.

28:33.503 --> 28:36.589
Matt, I'm gonna make a box of stuff
that I don't think I need,

28:36.673 --> 28:39.300
-but I want your opinion on it, too.
- Okay.

28:39.718 --> 28:43.221
Do you know what all these cords are for?

28:43.304 --> 28:46.683
Some of them I can. A lot of them I can't.

28:46.766 --> 28:49.811
A lot of them I'm not sure why
they were in there in the first place.

28:51.146 --> 28:54.399
I was thinking we could use one
of these drawers for electronics.

28:54.482 --> 28:55.442
Okay.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.406
Out of the miscellaneous items,

29:01.489 --> 29:04.659
electronic gadgets tend to become a mess.

29:05.201 --> 29:09.289
The goal is to store things in a way

29:09.372 --> 29:11.374
where you can see  everything one look.

29:11.458 --> 29:14.544
TIPS ON STORING MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS:

29:14.627 --> 29:16.838
1 COMBINE BOXES TO COMPARTMENTALIZE

29:16.921 --> 29:18.757
2 STORE EVERYTHING STANDING UPRIGHT

29:19.340 --> 29:24.345
ESPECIALLY, SMALL ITEMS
SUCH AS USB DRIVES AND MEMORY, CARDS

29:26.765 --> 29:27.891
Thank you.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.060
What kind of things are you letting go
would you say?

29:31.144 --> 29:36.357
Um, just random things that were,
like, boxes for electronics a lot. Um...

29:37.317 --> 29:39.444
From my first visit
to Disneyland out here.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.571
I just don't think I need it.

29:41.654 --> 29:44.783
-Oh, I'm torn. Matt, I'm too sentimental.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.368
Never mind, I take it back,
it brings me joy.

29:48.077 --> 29:49.078
Thank you.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.374
- Look at you, Matt.
- It's a lot less.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.043
You've made such huge progress.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.087
Thank you.

30:01.299 --> 30:05.428
<i>I feel guilty, because I see</i>
<i>how much work Matt is doing</i>

30:05.512 --> 30:08.848
<i>and I feel like I'm not helping him.</i>

30:12.310 --> 30:13.812
<i>Ever since the paper assignment,</i>

30:13.895 --> 30:16.314
<i>I have this block against</i>
<i>letting go of things.</i>

30:16.606 --> 30:20.318
<i>And that triggers some disappointment</i>
<i>in myself and...</i>

30:31.871 --> 30:33.540
-Pfft. Hey.
-Hey.

30:33.623 --> 30:37.836
I'm done with the, uh,
Christmas and holiday drawer.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.712
-love you.
-I love you, too.

30:39.796 --> 30:42.257
Alright. I think I'm feeling
a little anxious 'cause I feel like

30:42.340 --> 30:45.802
we haven't gotten rid of anything yet
and it's making me a little...

30:45.885 --> 30:48.096
-Yes.
-...feel crowded, I guess.

30:48.179 --> 30:51.516
Frank is usually the more outgoing person,
the person with more energy,

30:51.599 --> 30:56.104
so when he, um,
is feeling a little bit less...

30:56.646 --> 30:57.605
self-confident,

30:57.689 --> 31:00.984
<i>it definitely puts a damper on things.</i>

31:01.067 --> 31:03.778
<i>Just because his energy</i>
<i>feeds into my energy.</i>

31:03.862 --> 31:08.074
Feel like I'm really glad my parents
aren't coming for another, what,

31:08.157 --> 31:09.742
like, week and a half?

31:09.826 --> 31:12.620
-Mm-hmm.
-Because we are not ready at all.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.415
<i>So just trying to stay positive</i>

31:15.498 --> 31:18.918
and help inspire him
'cause he did that for me during clothes.

31:20.336 --> 31:24.591
-Medium plates, do we need 12? To...
-No. It feels extreme.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.426
We don't need to throw out
just to throw out.

31:26.509 --> 31:28.678
-Like I'm fine having nine.
-No, if it sparks your joy.

31:28.761 --> 31:30.680
It's not the number and--

31:31.264 --> 31:32.724
No, but I'm--

31:33.766 --> 31:35.810
I meant using the number
as, like, a guideline.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.020
Yeah, yeah.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.815
<i>Matt can be a little</i>
<i>quieter sometime,</i>

31:40.899 --> 31:45.028
<i>so to see him projecting opinions</i>
<i>so openly about the home,</i>

31:45.111 --> 31:48.114
<i>it made me really happy and inspired</i>

31:48.197 --> 31:51.409
that I wanted to, you know,
keep up with him,

31:51.492 --> 31:54.871
and not like-- especially because
he was experiencing a positive moment,

31:54.954 --> 31:57.290
I didn't want to take away
from it by being, like,

31:57.373 --> 32:00.752
you know, sad sack, so I was like, "Okay,
I have to kind of muscle through this."

32:01.169 --> 32:03.087
I find myself gravitating
towards these,

32:03.171 --> 32:04.881
perfectly honest, but how do you feel?

32:04.964 --> 32:08.968
We don't use small plates all that often,
so this would be an extreme amount.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.346
So I'm good letting these go.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.847
-Okay.
-Thank you.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.018
I don't like either of these,
so I'm good with these leaving.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.604
Thank you.

32:19.979 --> 32:22.690
Twenty, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.275
- Yeah.
-We have 26 mugs.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.486
Thirteen for each.
That seems totally reasonable.

32:26.569 --> 32:28.363
For two people.

32:28.446 --> 32:32.492
In some ways I think, like, having ties
to childhood makes you less of an adult,

32:32.575 --> 32:34.327
<i>so it's incumbent upon me</i>
<i>to know, like,</i>

32:34.410 --> 32:36.704
what really is valuable and meaningful,

32:36.788 --> 32:40.875
and what I'm just sort of afraid
to not hold onto anymore.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.336
I think fear isn't a good reason
to hold onto things.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.672
It should be, you know,
something positive, like happiness.

32:45.755 --> 32:48.174
Plastic knives.
I don't know if people really use knives.

32:48.257 --> 32:50.969
Knives we have a ton of.
I think let it go, let it go.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.680
Yeah. I don't feel like we ever cook
a quantity of food large enough

32:53.763 --> 32:55.932
that we'd really need this. Thank you.

32:56.015 --> 32:58.434
<i>I'm definitely proud of Frank.</i>
<i>He puts a lot of memories</i>
<i>into these things,</i>

33:01.020 --> 33:03.606
<i>so it wasn't easy for him</i>
<i>letting go of stuff.</i>

33:04.190 --> 33:08.236
But now I feel like we're both finally
on the road to adulthood.

33:10.613 --> 33:13.700
Oh, yeah. We're gonna make
some people very happy today.

33:13.783 --> 33:14.951
Where are we going?

33:15.493 --> 33:22.125
We're going to Out of the Closet
to donate our clothes.

33:22.291 --> 33:24.127
<i>And other objects.</i>

33:24.210 --> 33:27.171
<i>I feel like we're on</i>
<i>the homeward stretch.</i>

33:27.255 --> 33:29.924
<i>Like, it feels like we've conquered</i>
<i>so much in theÂ house already,</i>

33:30.008 --> 33:32.176
<i>like, getting through some</i>
<i>of theÂ miscellanea today</i>

33:32.260 --> 33:34.804
<i>made me feel like,</i>
<i>"Okay, we're, like, coming on the end.</i>

33:34.971 --> 33:36.723
<i>Knowing I have this home that, like,</i>

33:36.806 --> 33:39.642
is getting to where I want it to get
and will eventually

33:39.726 --> 33:42.270
is just, like, giving me an extra boost

33:42.353 --> 33:44.272
that I'm-- for which I'm very grateful.

33:44.355 --> 33:48.860
We are off to Goodwill to donate the rest!

33:49.485 --> 33:52.989
And I think that will be it,
believe it or not.

34:07.336 --> 34:08.713
-Hello.
- Hi!

34:08.796 --> 34:10.048
-Hi.
-Nice to see you.

34:10.131 --> 34:12.884
Nice to see you, Marie!
Hi, Iida, nice to see you again!

34:12.967 --> 34:15.053
-Hi. Nice to see you guys.
-Hi.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.388
-How was homework?

34:17.764 --> 34:20.767
A lot, but we actually got
all the way through it, yep.

34:20.850 --> 34:24.062
-Oh my gosh! Let's go see it! Can't wait!

34:24.145 --> 34:25.605
-Lead the way.
-Okay.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.232
Here it is.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.778
- <i>Linen closet.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Linen closet.</i>

34:34.405 --> 34:36.657
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>
<i>Look at how neat it looks!</i>

34:36.741 --> 34:37.658
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

34:37.742 --> 34:40.078
<i> And it's washcloths</i>
<i>and hand towels.</i>

34:40.161 --> 34:42.205
<i>Oh! Beautiful!</i>

34:42.288 --> 34:43.748
<i>So beautiful!</i>

34:44.165 --> 34:45.249
<i>Breathtaking.</i>

34:46.834 --> 34:49.754
This makes it so much easier
to see where everything is.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.882
Before everything was, like, exploding
out of it. It feels much easier now.

34:52.965 --> 34:56.177
<i>I feel really good. I, like, want</i>
<i>to invite a lot of people over now,</i>

34:56.260 --> 34:58.096
<i>so I can, like, open up the closets,</i>

34:58.179 --> 35:00.181
<i>be like, "See how organized we are?</i>
<i>Look at this."</i>

35:00.723 --> 35:02.100
<i>I'm growing up and moving on</i>

35:02.183 --> 35:04.227
and this is the time
where I think we're gonna

35:04.310 --> 35:06.229
have a home that we're very proud of.

35:07.814 --> 35:11.234
Wonderful. Okay, let's go
to the kitchen. Can't wait to see.

35:12.693 --> 35:16.197
<i>So we reorganized,</i>
<i>and sorted all the food,</i>

35:16.280 --> 35:20.493
<i>and made this our kind of breakfast area</i>
<i>with our coffee maker and toaster.</i>

35:20.743 --> 35:23.246
- <i>It looks like a store.</i>

35:23.329 --> 35:24.872
<i>-Oh my gosh!</i>

35:24.956 --> 35:28.835
I feel like I am the adult
that I'm presenting to the world.

35:28.918 --> 35:32.255
<i>I'm not hiding my messy</i>
<i>true self anymore.</i>

35:34.048 --> 35:36.342
<i>We are stronger for doing this because,</i>

35:36.425 --> 35:38.845
you know, it challenged both of us
in different ways.

35:38.928 --> 35:42.723
I had to sort of let go of some things
to which I was clinging,

35:42.807 --> 35:45.476
<i>and Matt over time learned</i>
<i>to, like, vocalize his emotions.</i>

35:45.560 --> 35:48.855
<i>So, I think it helped us</i>
<i>address things within our self.</i>

35:48.938 --> 35:53.401
I definitely feel like I've become
more emotionally open,

35:53.484 --> 35:55.153
<i>and I finally felt that, like,</i>

35:55.236 --> 35:58.573
<i>"Wow, like, I really am feeling</i>
<i>that spark of joy."</i>

35:58.990 --> 36:02.869
<i>I did want to have that feeling</i>
<i>and bring it through the rest of my life</i>

36:02.952 --> 36:05.663
because you're just
a happier person, honestly.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.834
So how do you feel now
that you've reached the end?

36:09.917 --> 36:13.087
I'm very proud of our home
and happy with, uh, the work we've done,

36:13.171 --> 36:14.964
and really grateful for you teaching us.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.093
<i>Yeah. I believe your parents</i>
<i>will be pretty shocked</i>

36:19.177 --> 36:21.179
<i>to see how tidy this home is.</i>

36:21.262 --> 36:23.181
- <i>"Shocked" is the word.</i>

36:23.264 --> 36:26.058
<i>It really feels like</i>
<i>our lives are changed</i>

36:26.142 --> 36:28.269
<i>because you came and helped us,</i>
<i>so thank you.</i>

36:28.352 --> 36:31.898
I don't think it would've been done
if you hadn't come in here and helped us.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.818
I'm so glad to hear that.
Thank you.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.362
<i>I think my parents are gonna be</i>
<i>really happy with what they see</i>

36:38.446 --> 36:42.033
and they're gonna feel that we've really
created this home for ourselves

36:42.116 --> 36:45.119
<i>as adults, which makes me</i>
<i>very happy to think about.</i>

36:45.203 --> 36:46.204
-Keep in touch.
-Thank you.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.121
Bye!

36:47.205 --> 36:48.122
Thank you.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.042
-I'm sad to see her go.
-Oh!

36:51.709 --> 36:54.086
- You miss her already.
- Mm-hmm.

36:54.921 --> 36:58.299
I think Frank's parents are not
gonna be worried about him

36:58.382 --> 37:02.053
being with me 'cause
this place looks so nice, so...

37:02.136 --> 37:04.013
In large part to you, so...

37:04.388 --> 37:06.432
And you. It was a team effort.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.692
I suppose you're not nervous at all
'cause they're not your parents.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.070
I am nervous.
I want them to like it, of course I do.

37:24.617 --> 37:27.745
Ah, Matt, I got a tiny fleck
of beet on me.

37:28.329 --> 37:29.914
Oh, it's fine. That's barely--

37:29.997 --> 37:30.915
-You sure?
-Yeah.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.416
Don't put water on it

37:32.500 --> 37:34.835
'cause that's gonna look wet
when your parents get here.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.215
<i>This visit from my parents</i>
<i>is a big thing for me</i>

37:39.298 --> 37:42.426
because this home is a symbol of my, uh...

37:42.551 --> 37:45.304
my relationship with Matt
and my relationship with my parents,

37:45.388 --> 37:46.806
<i>my relationship with the world.</i>

37:47.306 --> 37:49.350
So it's vital that they like
what they see.

37:55.106 --> 37:55.940
Okay.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.068
-Hi.
-Hi, Frankie!

37:59.151 --> 38:01.028
Hi. How are you?

38:01.404 --> 38:02.863
-Wow!

38:03.155 --> 38:04.073
Hi.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.909
It looks really nice!

38:06.993 --> 38:08.869
This isn't what I was expecting.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.538
I thought I'd show you guys everything

38:10.621 --> 38:12.581
just 'cause we've been doing
a lot of folding,

38:12.665 --> 38:15.042
and sort of compartmentalizing
techniques with Marie.
-Oh, I love that.
-And this is our dining room.

38:17.586 --> 38:20.339
-How pretty.
- Then I can show you my closet.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.467
-It was very disorganized until recently.
-  Well, this I gotta see.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.927
-Yeah, this is it.
-Wow!

38:25.011 --> 38:26.762
We got all my shirts,

38:27.305 --> 38:28.264
my sweaters.

38:28.347 --> 38:29.598
Oh, this is cute.

38:29.682 --> 38:32.393
I'm gonna reheat the chicken for you guys.
That's a cake for later.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.353
-You cooked for us?
-It wasn't-- Of course I did!

38:34.854 --> 38:38.232
Anyhoo, so, yeah, we have just
a limited number of pots and pans,

38:38.316 --> 38:39.650
so you can grab what you need.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.236
And then we tried to pare down
how many things we have.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.823
That way we have, like, you know,
our mugs, our cups, our plates, our bowls.

38:45.906 --> 38:47.325
That looks really nice.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.618
Frankie has never failed us.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.330
He is a wonderful, wonderful guy.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.875
<i>He's one of those guys</i>
<i>that always does the right thing</i>

38:55.958 --> 38:58.044
<i>and makes the right decisions in life.</i>

38:58.127 --> 39:00.379
And I'm very happy he's my son.

39:00.796 --> 39:03.466
What I'm most proud about Frankie
and what he's done

39:03.841 --> 39:07.094
is that he's matured as a person,

39:07.553 --> 39:12.141
and it shows in how he's living
and how he's organized his life.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.727
Imagine that you've had a son
living with you,

39:15.061 --> 39:16.687
and you see his room,

39:16.896 --> 39:18.439
<i>which wasn't the best.</i>

39:18.773 --> 39:22.568
And then you see him in college,
which really was bad.

39:22.651 --> 39:26.947
<i>And now to see a difference</i>
<i>tells me that he went forward.</i>

39:27.281 --> 39:28.324
I'm very proud of him.

39:30.159 --> 39:32.161
Down here are sort of some accessories.

39:32.244 --> 39:33.537
-Oh, wow!
-Oh, wow!

39:33.621 --> 39:35.831
-I love the way that looks!
- Look at the ties.

39:35.915 --> 39:39.710
-This one I like. I can take that one.
-No. No. No.

39:39.794 --> 39:44.131
<i>The fact that he and Matt,</i>
<i>as a partnership,</i> <i>agreed to do this,</i>

39:44.215 --> 39:46.342
it just makes you
feel good about the two of them.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.970
I'd love to see them together
for a long time,

39:50.054 --> 39:51.722
'cause they're really good partners.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.475
Are you guys hungry?
Do you want us to serve you lunch?

39:54.558 --> 39:56.519
-Did Matt supervise?
-I supervised.

39:56.602 --> 39:58.396
Okay, I feel better. I'll eat it, yeah.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.689
-Great. Let's go to the kitchen.
-Let's go to the kitchen.

40:01.315 --> 40:03.901
They said everything I wanted them to say
without being prompted,

40:03.984 --> 40:05.653
-which made me so happy.
-No prompting.

40:05.736 --> 40:06.570
I know.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.322
<i> I've always been proud</i>
<i>of the place,</i>

40:08.406 --> 40:11.700
<i>but now it's just like tenfold</i>
<i>of what I was feeling before,</i>

40:11.784 --> 40:13.786
<i>and it's nice to just see</i>

40:13.869 --> 40:16.872
<i>such a positive reaction</i>
<i>from your parents, for sure.</i>

40:17.206 --> 40:19.333
I feel our union is very, um,

40:19.417 --> 40:21.419
you know, respected by them, and...

40:21.502 --> 40:23.045
Not that I didn't believe in it before,

40:23.129 --> 40:25.047
but it's always good
to have family on your side.

40:25.464 --> 40:27.091
And here's a toast to the two of you.

40:27.299 --> 40:29.969
May you always be happy in this house

40:30.052 --> 40:31.929
and everywhere else that you live.

40:32.012 --> 40:34.014
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- <i>God bless you both.</i>

40:36.100 --> 40:38.602
âª <i>One place means everything to meÂ </i>âª

40:38.686 --> 40:40.604
âª<i> Na-na-na-na-na-na-naÂ </i>âª

40:40.688 --> 40:43.065
âª <i>One magic carpet's all I need</i>Â âª

40:43.149 --> 40:45.067
âª<i> Na-na-na-na-na-na-naÂ </i>âª

40:45.151 --> 40:48.070
âª<i> One face that waits to smile for me </i>âª

40:48.779 --> 40:51.323
âª<i> Let's go back to that no placeÂ </i>âª

40:51.490 --> 40:54.118
<i>âª No place like home used to beÂ âª</i>

40:54.201 --> 40:55.786
âª<i> Na-na-na-na-na-na-naÂ </i>âª

40:55.911 --> 40:57.955
<i>âª No place like home âª</i>

40:58.497 --> 41:00.499
âª<i> Na-na-na-na-na-na-naÂ </i>âª

41:00.583 --> 41:02.918
<i>âª No place like home âª</i>
