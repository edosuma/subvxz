my feet don't hang over the edge

00:17.033 --> 00:20.033

can always reach you.

00:20.100 --> 00:23.466
Oh, no. This is our first bed
as husband and wife.

00:23.533 --> 00:27.366

in a dress like that.

Only the top was lower
and the bottom was higher.

it was just a belt.

We went out
for coffee afterwards

10:49.733 --> 10:52.366
and we did improv
right there in the diner.

10:52.433 --> 10:54.166

but I made $3 in tips.

11:26.406 --> 11:28.640
we only lost the money
we set aside for the bed.

11:28.706 --> 11:32.006
It seems insignificant
by comparison, doesn't it?

11:32.073 --> 11:34.973
You gambled away our bed money?

11:35.040 --> 11:36.640
I'm sorry, baby,
I made a mistake.

11:36.706 --> 11:38.773
I‐I shouldn't have hit
that soft seventeen.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.240
Overton, what's this?

11:42.306 --> 11:45.406
Fifty‐eight more payments
over the next five years.

11:47.106 --> 11:48.440
It's a symbol of our union

11:48.506 --> 11:50.206
of our responsibility
to one another.

11:50.273 --> 11:53.006
I never would have spent money
without checking with you first.

11:53.073 --> 11:54.940
That is what married people do.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.106
Oh, look here, girl.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.773
Don't talk to me about
what married couples do.

11:57.840 --> 12:01.480
I'm the one out every night
playing Betty, the blow dryer.

12:01.546 --> 12:04.013
Oh, don't you go there, <i>senor.</i>

12:04.080 --> 12:06.180
I'm just trying
to help my career.

12:06.246 --> 12:08.446
I just wanted
to have a romantic evenin'.

12:08.513 --> 12:11.580
But you want to hang out
with your thespian friends.

12:11.646 --> 12:14.080
So when my boys come around,
what I'm supposed to do?

12:14.146 --> 12:16.380
Sit here and cry
into my souffle?

12:16.446 --> 12:18.880
Goin' out with the boys
is one thing

12:18.946 --> 12:22.646
gambling away our furniture
is just..

12:22.713 --> 12:25.246
You know, I'm just gonna say it.
It's stupid!

12:27.313 --> 12:30.346
Look, baby, arguin' is not
gonna fix anything.

12:30.413 --> 12:32.380
Just come on over here
and let's come up

12:32.446 --> 12:33.880
with a plan,
so we can get our money back.

12:33.946 --> 12:35.280
‐ Take minute to just‐‐
‐ No, no.

12:35.346 --> 12:36.980
You lost this money by yourself

12:37.046 --> 12:38.980
you figure out a way
to get it back by yourself

12:39.046 --> 12:40.480
gambler man!

12:42.346 --> 12:43.646
[sighs]

12:45.280 --> 12:48.746
Oh‐oh, is this another thing
married couples do? Sleep alone?

12:54.980 --> 12:57.446
Sorry I had to bring you
into this, Hoss.

13:02.553 --> 13:04.186
Pass the cereal, please.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.853
Ohh, what,
d‐don't we have the kind

13:08.920 --> 13:10.853
with the dancing bananas
on the box?

13:12.386 --> 13:13.653
We did when you lived here

13:13.720 --> 13:17.020
but you got married
and moved out, remember?

13:17.086 --> 13:18.786
Yeah, girl,
the groceries are for the people

13:18.853 --> 13:20.220
who live here.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.253
You two have no idea
how hard marriage is.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.120
You‐you‐you date somebody
for three years

13:27.186 --> 13:29.186
you think you know him,
and then you find out

13:29.253 --> 13:31.220
he‐he refrigerates
his drill bits

13:31.286 --> 13:33.386
and hates when you drink milk
out of a carton.

13:35.620 --> 13:37.886
You know, for the record,
we don't like that either.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.453
Worst of all

13:41.520 --> 13:43.120
he has a mistress.

13:44.486 --> 13:45.753
Gambling.

13:48.353 --> 13:52.453
Synclaire, I mean, the man
had one night of bad judgment.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.053
I mean, don't nobody hit
on a soft seventeen.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.686
But he did apologize.

13:58.586 --> 14:00.393
What, girl,
you think I was too hard on him?

14:00.460 --> 14:03.560
No way, baby.
Love is a battlefield.

14:03.626 --> 14:06.460
Now, look,
you start waving that white flag

14:06.526 --> 14:08.726
he'll take your hill.

14:08.793 --> 14:10.093
What you need to do
is put on a helmet

14:10.160 --> 14:12.160
grab an Uzi
and take no prisoners.

14:13.660 --> 14:16.360
Now, look, you're not exactly
squeaky clean, Synclaire.

14:16.426 --> 14:19.893
It wasn't the man's first choice
to go out gamblin' at night.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.360
You walked out on a souffle.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.226
I did, didn't I?

14:25.293 --> 14:26.693
And from the smell
of the garbage disposal

14:26.760 --> 14:28.660
it was grand marnier.

14:43.193 --> 14:45.226
‐ Uh, Norwood, um..
‐ Mm.

14:45.293 --> 14:47.060
Dear, do you think maybe, um

14:47.126 --> 14:50.626
that Kingston would be more
comfortable out on the terrace?

14:51.926 --> 14:53.493
Oh, heavens, no.

14:54.693 --> 14:57.260
The night air will play havoc
with his sinuses.

14:59.826 --> 15:03.766
Darling, what do you say
I pop open a bottle of Dom?

15:03.833 --> 15:05.533
It'll help relax us both.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.000
Daddy'll be right back,
Kingston.

15:17.866 --> 15:19.400
What are you looking at, dog?

15:26.833 --> 15:28.566
Oh, it's like that, huh?

15:28.633 --> 15:30.500
You, give me, give me.

15:30.566 --> 15:33.800
Give me my damn bra back,
you raggedy dust mop.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.066
[growling]

15:36.133 --> 15:40.666
O‐okay. Fine. Fine. Two can play
this little game with you.

15:42.533 --> 15:44.633
[squeaking]

15:45.133 --> 15:46.100
Hah!

15:48.833 --> 15:50.600
[chuckling]

15:50.666 --> 15:54.266
Uh, oh‐oh, oh, how nice.
Mm, so good.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.200
Will Kingston like

15:56.266 --> 15:59.440
a nice piece of chocolate, hmm?

15:59.506 --> 16:01.073
Mm‐mmm.

16:01.140 --> 16:03.473
Something so good.

16:03.540 --> 16:06.206
Hah! Fetch, you miserable mutt!

16:13.606 --> 16:14.773
[chuckles]

16:17.540 --> 16:20.140
I hope you haven't started
without me.

16:22.006 --> 16:23.540
[banging on door]

16:23.606 --> 16:24.806
What was that?

16:24.873 --> 16:28.440
Mm, mm, it's just the, just the,
the beating of my heart.

16:28.506 --> 16:29.706
Listen. Mm.

16:29.773 --> 16:31.140
[banging on door]

16:31.206 --> 16:32.140
Kingston?

16:32.206 --> 16:33.240
[Kingston whimpering]

16:33.306 --> 16:34.573
Kingston?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.540
Oh, you crazy dog

16:41.606 --> 16:44.006
locking yourself
in the bathroom.

16:45.773 --> 16:48.740
Now, where were we?

16:56.340 --> 16:58.873
‐ Hello.
‐ Hello.

17:00.013 --> 17:03.080
No post‐rehearsal
chit‐chat tonight?

17:03.146 --> 17:06.180
Nope.
No hangin' out with the boys?

17:06.246 --> 17:09.546
No. Just me and Hoss here
kickin' it.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.313
Well, can I get you something?

17:11.380 --> 17:14.546
A sandwich? A beer?

17:14.613 --> 17:16.512
An apology?

17:16.579 --> 17:18.646
Oh..

17:18.713 --> 17:20.713
Come on, girl,
you don't have to apologize.

17:20.780 --> 17:23.046
I'm the one that lost our money.

17:23.113 --> 17:25.813
Yeah, but I shouldn't have
thrown you out of our bedroom.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.180
I paid for it too.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.680
One of those spring on that old
mattress caught me in the ass.

17:29.746 --> 17:30.713
Ooh.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.246
[doorbell rings]

17:33.313 --> 17:35.646
Oh, well,
I have a lovely surprise

17:35.713 --> 17:39.213
that would dull the pain
in your beautiful posterior.

17:42.113 --> 17:45.280
Uh, delivery for Overton Jones.
Sign here, please.

17:45.346 --> 17:47.613
‐ 'Alright.'
‐ Is that what I think it is?

17:47.680 --> 17:50.413
Yeah, baby.
Midnight Confessions.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.746
Now you got a legitimate excuse
to talk dirty to me, mama.

17:55.213 --> 17:56.946
‐ Newly‐weds, right?
‐ 'Yeah, yeah.'

17:57.013 --> 17:58.846
Oh, anyway, bedroom's that way.

17:58.913 --> 18:00.886
Uh, set it up right next
to that giant troll.

18:00.953 --> 18:03.020
‐ You'll see it.
‐ Alright.

18:03.086 --> 18:05.520
Overton, wh‐where did you get
the money to get this mattress?

18:05.586 --> 18:08.186
Oh, my good.. You didn't go back
to the den of sin, did you?

18:08.253 --> 18:10.920
No, no, relax, baby.
I sold my old leather jacket.

18:10.986 --> 18:13.720
You know the one I said
I wanted to get buried in.

18:13.786 --> 18:14.886
Yeah, right down there.

18:14.953 --> 18:17.920
Well, I have a little surprise
for you too.

18:17.986 --> 18:20.286
I got halfway to rehearsal
and I realized

18:20.353 --> 18:22.220
I'd rather be home with my man.

18:22.286 --> 18:24.553
Oh..

18:24.620 --> 18:27.986
That's the best present
you could ever give me, Marisol.

18:28.053 --> 18:29.853
No, papi,
the best is yet to come.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.153
Mmm.

18:32.886 --> 18:34.253
Morning.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.720
Wait a minute.
You have something on your arm.

18:39.653 --> 18:41.086
Oh, it's just a flea.

18:43.220 --> 18:45.153
Well, I guess
when you lie down with dogs..

18:46.520 --> 18:48.320
[laughing]

18:48.386 --> 18:52.153
For your information, I broke up
with Norwood last night.

18:52.220 --> 18:55.553
I told him that it was either me
or Kingston.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.886
So, I take it he went with
the one that was housebroken?

19:00.926 --> 19:03.993
You knew she had the gun
and yet you gave her the bullet.

19:05.093 --> 19:07.193
[knock on door]

19:07.260 --> 19:09.793
Norwood, if you've come to beg
back into my life

19:09.860 --> 19:11.160
I'm sorry, it's too late.

19:11.226 --> 19:14.393
Regine, uh,
Kingston's in the hospital

19:14.460 --> 19:16.493
[crying]
with chocolate poisoning.

19:18.960 --> 19:22.326
Chocolate poisoning? What‐what,
d‐d‐dogs can't eat chocolate?

19:23.993 --> 19:26.760
No, no, no, i‐it messes
with their little systems.

19:26.826 --> 19:29.193
S‐see, I‐I don't even know
how he got his paws on it.

19:29.260 --> 19:31.760
I‐I don't even keep chocolate
in the house.

19:35.626 --> 19:39.326
Hmm. Sounds suspicious.

19:40.626 --> 19:44.526
Um, look, does, uh,
Kingston have any enemies?

19:48.326 --> 19:50.693
Come on, Max,
now, who, who wouldn't love

19:50.760 --> 19:52.426
that adorable little wiggins?

19:52.493 --> 19:53.926
Dah, you'd be surprised.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.826
All you need is a motive,
say jealousy

19:55.893 --> 19:57.326
and, uh, opportunity.

19:57.393 --> 19:59.093
Norwood..

19:59.160 --> 20:02.800
...who has been
in your apartment recently?

20:07.400 --> 20:11.200
Regine, I am so sorry
about last night.

20:11.266 --> 20:13.900
But I desperately need you
in my life right now.

20:13.966 --> 20:15.766
My Kingston could die.

20:18.266 --> 20:19.700
Really?

20:21.966 --> 20:24.300
I'm here for you, baby.

20:24.366 --> 20:28.766
Mm, now, we will miss Kingston..

20:28.833 --> 20:31.733
...but we will
get through this together.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.166
[telephone ringing]

20:35.866 --> 20:37.800
Hello. Yes.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.033
You are going straight to hell.

20:40.100 --> 20:42.333
You gonna burn forever, girl.
You burning.

20:43.566 --> 20:44.733
It was an accident, alright.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.433
It was an accident that nobody

20:46.500 --> 20:49.033
is going to find out about,
right?

20:49.100 --> 20:50.533
‐ Dog killer.
‐ Shut up!

20:50.600 --> 20:54.100
Hey, everybody,
i‐it's a miracle.

20:54.166 --> 20:56.500
The‐the doctor say
that Kingston's gonna make it.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.006
I guess all of our good thoughts
paid off.

21:03.073 --> 21:04.606
[laughs]
Right.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.940
Isn't this wonderful, Regine?

21:09.006 --> 21:10.773
Yeah, it's‐it's wonderful.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.706
Oh, yeah, oh,
it's‐it's wonderful. Y‐no.

21:13.773 --> 21:18.306
Oh, it is so wonderful.
Ooh, it's wonderful.

21:18.373 --> 21:20.273
‐ It's so, so wonderful.
‐ But‐‐

21:20.340 --> 21:22.406
You two have
a wonderful life together.

21:22.473 --> 21:24.106
‐ But..
‐ Freak.

21:25.906 --> 21:27.373
Well, look on the bright side,
Regine.

21:27.440 --> 21:30.940
I mean, in ten years
the dog will be dead..

21:31.006 --> 21:32.506
...and you'll still be single.

21:33.706 --> 21:35.306
[laughing]

21:44.506 --> 21:46.206
Ooh, I thought that was the dog!

21:46.273 --> 21:47.906
[laughing]

21:50.640 --> 21:53.273
I've spent the week
defending scum who de..

21:53.340 --> 21:56.306
They commit
every crime imaginable.

21:56.373 --> 21:58.306
[laughing]

21:59.780 --> 22:02.446
I would've rolled with it
till you looked at me!

22:04.113 --> 22:06.246
Your paws is on my nightie.

22:11.713 --> 22:13.246
<i>(female #1)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo.</i>
