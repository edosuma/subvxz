WEBVTT

00:04.370 --> 00:05.480
<b>All right!</b>

00:05.820 --> 00:07.090
<b>We made it through!</b>

00:07.090 --> 00:08.980
<b>Good work!</b>

00:09.310 --> 00:11.690
<b>I think we've gone five kilometers today.</b>

00:12.130 --> 00:15.670
<b>At first, I thought it would take years,</b>

00:15.670 --> 00:17.240
<b>but at this pace...</b>

00:17.380 --> 00:18.930
<b>Masadora!</b>

00:18.930 --> 00:20.810
<b>Take two!</b>

00:20.810 --> 00:21.830
<b>Okay!</b>

00:22.240 --> 00:24.970
<b>Let's return to the starting point now.</b>

00:24.970 --> 00:26.400
<b>Again?!</b>

01:47.000 --> 01:52.040
<b>Strengthen x And x Threaten</b>

01:52.620 --> 01:56.170
<b>Next, we'll work on obtaining monster cards.</b>

01:56.660 --> 02:00.640
<b>You have the requisite physical strength 
to defeat every enemy here.</b>

02:01.270 --> 02:03.150
<b>What you lack</b>

02:03.150 --> 02:08.190
<b>is the ability to come up with 
a plan of attack as you fight.</b>

02:08.720 --> 02:11.190
<b>In other words, the ability to strategize.</b>

02:11.570 --> 02:12.910
<b>The ability to...</b>

02:12.910 --> 02:14.320
<b>...strategize.</b>

02:14.590 --> 02:17.170
<b>I'm not going to say a single word,</b>

02:17.170 --> 02:20.820
<b>so devise your own means 
to defeat the monsters.</b>

02:24.370 --> 02:29.080
<b><i>Still, the people who made this 
game really were special...</i></b>

02:29.880 --> 02:31.540
<b><i>The game's programmed in such a way</i></b>

02:31.540 --> 02:34.390
<b><i>that you're guaranteed to get 
stronger as you progress.</i></b>

02:35.780 --> 02:37.590
<b><i>And, most likely, all for the purpose</i></b>

02:38.060 --> 02:40.080
<b><i>of making him stronger.</i></b>

02:46.380 --> 02:47.630
<b>Yes!</b>

02:47.630 --> 02:49.550
<b>I got the Marimo-chi!</b>

02:52.020 --> 02:56.150
<b><i></i>Nen<i> battles require one to fight 
against many different enemy types.</i></b>

02:56.990 --> 02:59.790
<b><i>The ability to think on your feet</i></b>

02:59.790 --> 03:01.660
<b><i>is the most critical technique.</i></b>

03:02.340 --> 03:04.540
<b><i>First, get used to thinking all the time,</i></b>

03:04.540 --> 03:07.160
<b><i>until your thinking is tied to your reflexes.</i></b>

03:07.950 --> 03:11.160
<b><i>This game is a training program 
to help you achieve that.</i></b>

03:13.580 --> 03:18.050
<b><i>The hardest monster in this 
area is the Bubble Horse.</i></b>

03:18.490 --> 03:20.060
<b><i>If they clear that hurdle,</i></b>

03:20.770 --> 03:22.390
<b><i>they'll complete the second stage!</i></b>

03:29.240 --> 03:29.960
<b><i>Zetsu!</i></b>

03:34.460 --> 03:35.810
<b>Caught it!</b>

03:37.750 --> 03:40.330
<b>I got a Bubble Horse!</b>

03:40.330 --> 03:41.210
<b>Way to go.</b>

03:41.210 --> 03:41.920
<b>Yep!</b>

03:42.700 --> 03:46.550
<b><i>When it comes to analysis and 
physical strength, Killua's stronger.</i></b>

03:47.310 --> 03:52.580
<b><i>But Gon makes up for it with his 
concentration and recovery speed.</i></b>

03:53.260 --> 03:56.090
<b><i>They make a perfect team!</i></b>

03:57.550 --> 04:01.090
<b>Okay, we'll now begin to 
work on your defense.</b>

04:08.330 --> 04:09.540
<b>Is that...</b>

04:09.540 --> 04:10.930
<b>That's right, Gon.</b>

04:10.930 --> 04:13.100
<b>This is the technique you've been using.</b>

04:13.140 --> 04:14.100
<b>Ten</b>

04:13.430 --> 04:17.460
<b><i>Ten, Zetsu, Ren, Hatsu</i>, and <i>Gyo</i></b>

04:14.100 --> 04:14.980
<b>Zetsu</b>

04:14.980 --> 04:15.900
<b>Ren</b>

04:15.900 --> 04:16.730
<b>Hatsu</b>

04:16.730 --> 04:19.530
<b>Gyo</b>

04:17.460 --> 04:19.640
<b>are combined in this technique.</b>

04:20.270 --> 04:20.860
<b><i>Ko!</i></b>

04:20.880 --> 04:31.120
<b>Ko</b>

04:22.720 --> 04:26.460
<b>You focus all of your aura into one 
part of your body, then attack.</b>

04:27.000 --> 04:31.120
<b>This gives it far greater power 
than your regular attacks.</b>

04:32.120 --> 04:34.440
<b>I'm going to attack with my fist.</b>

04:34.900 --> 04:37.600
<b>You must block my attacks.</b>

04:37.900 --> 04:39.130
<b>You may not dodge.</b>

04:40.690 --> 04:42.390
<b>You've figured it out?</b>

04:42.390 --> 04:43.380
<b>That's right...</b>

04:44.860 --> 04:47.500
<b>If you use your aura to block normally,</b>

04:47.500 --> 04:49.260
<b>you'll take considerable damage.</b>

04:49.900 --> 04:51.270
<b>So what should you do?</b>

04:51.520 --> 04:53.300
<b>We should use <i>Ko</i>, too.</b>

04:53.300 --> 04:54.640
<b>You're half right.</b>

04:56.350 --> 04:57.860
<b><i>Ko</i> against <i>Ko</i>.</b>

04:58.390 --> 05:01.440
<b>As long as you and your opponent 
are similar in <i>Nen</i> capacity,</b>

05:01.440 --> 05:03.020
<b>you'll escape unscratched.</b>

05:03.630 --> 05:04.400
<b>However...</b>

05:06.100 --> 05:09.960
<b>If your opponent hits you in a place 
where you weren't using <i>Ko</i>,</b>

05:09.960 --> 05:11.370
<b>you'll be destroyed.</b>

05:12.680 --> 05:15.300
<b>Then we should use <i>Ko</i> on our entire body.</b>

05:15.600 --> 05:16.920
<b>Though it's contradictory.</b>

05:17.170 --> 05:18.540
<b>Exactly.</b>

05:18.540 --> 05:20.940
<b>This technique combines <i>Ten</i> and <i>Ren</i>.</b>

05:20.940 --> 05:22.290
<b><i>Ken</i>.</b>

05:21.690 --> 05:24.470
<b>Ken</b>

05:23.430 --> 05:25.310
<b>You defend yourself</b>

05:25.310 --> 05:27.920
<b>by shrouding your body in 
much more aura than usual.</b>

05:28.490 --> 05:32.850
<b>It isn't as strong as <i>Ko</i>, 
but it's far more practical.</b>

05:33.670 --> 05:35.930
<b>Gon, use <i>Ren</i>.</b>

05:37.920 --> 05:40.440
<b>To sustain that for a prolonged 
period is called <i>Ken</i>.</b>

05:41.570 --> 05:44.080
<b>Now protect yourself from my punch!</b>

05:49.750 --> 05:50.810
<b><i>So slow.</i></b>

06:02.400 --> 06:06.090
<b>You must have relaxed when you 
saw how slowly I was moving.</b>

06:06.510 --> 06:09.530
<b>If you'd stopped using <i>Ken</i>, 
your face would have been smashed.</b>

06:10.410 --> 06:12.310
<b>That was the power of <i>Ko</i> alone.</b>

06:12.770 --> 06:16.860
<b>When I add the speed and power 
packed by a normal punch,</b>

06:16.860 --> 06:19.100
<b>it becomes many times stronger.</b>

06:19.590 --> 06:21.230
<b>Even dozens of times stronger.</b>

06:23.880 --> 06:27.990
<b>I'll start by going slowly, 
but you won't get any warning.</b>

06:29.220 --> 06:32.620
<b>Keep using <i>Ken</i>, and try to 
withstand my attacks.</b>

06:51.640 --> 06:52.520
<b>Gon!</b>

06:52.520 --> 06:55.390
<b>Hmm, that was almost two minutes...</b>

06:55.880 --> 07:00.890
<b><i>I had no idea it could be this 
hard to keep up my </i>Nen.</b>

07:01.440 --> 07:04.600
<b>You need to be able to sustain 
<i>Ken</i> for at least thirty minutes,</b>

07:04.600 --> 07:06.530
<b>or you won't stand a chance.</b>

07:11.490 --> 07:13.330
<b>Okay, we're through!</b>

07:13.330 --> 07:15.030
<b>Learning to use <i>Ken</i>!</b>

07:26.090 --> 07:28.050
<b>Good, that was thirty minutes!</b>

07:28.410 --> 07:31.050
<b>Over the past month, 
you've become a lot tougher.</b>

07:31.230 --> 07:32.630
<b>The number 3!</b>

07:32.630 --> 07:33.750
<b>Bingo!</b>

07:33.750 --> 07:35.180
<b>Killua was slightly faster.</b>

07:35.790 --> 07:37.720
<b>Gon, give me a thousand push-ups.</b>

07:40.510 --> 07:43.350
<b>Okay, we'll begin actual 
combat training today.</b>

07:44.810 --> 07:45.810
<b><i>Ken!</i></b>

07:47.170 --> 07:51.420
<b>In your current state, your attack 
power is 50, defense 50.</b>

07:51.870 --> 07:55.820
<b>So if you fight each other while using <i>Ken</i>,</b>

07:55.820 --> 07:58.690
<b>you won't be able to deal much damage.</b>

07:58.690 --> 07:59.830
<b>What should you do?</b>

08:00.170 --> 08:01.570
<b>Use <i>Ko</i>!</b>

08:01.570 --> 08:02.970
<b>You fool.</b>

08:02.970 --> 08:05.910
<b>What if he hits you where 
you aren't using <i>Ko</i>?</b>

08:05.910 --> 08:07.160
<b>Use <i>Gyo</i>?</b>

08:07.160 --> 08:08.080
<b>Correct!</b>

08:09.830 --> 08:13.180
<b>From your current 50-50 state,</b>

08:13.180 --> 08:14.560
<b>at the moment of attack,</b>

08:14.560 --> 08:17.160
<b>you shift your fist to 70 POW,</b>

08:17.160 --> 08:18.850
<b>and the rest to 30 POW.</b>

08:19.250 --> 08:24.550
<b>You can use <i>Gyo</i> to alter your POW 
depending on the situation.</b>

08:24.550 --> 08:26.020
<b>This is <i>Ryu</i>!</b>

08:25.480 --> 08:26.860
<b>Ryu</b>

08:27.280 --> 08:28.580
<b>Let's get started...</b>

08:28.580 --> 08:31.860
<b>Right hand to 70 POW, 
rest of your body to 30 POW!</b>

08:32.440 --> 08:34.180
<b>It doesn't have to be precise, so try it out.</b>

08:38.200 --> 08:41.180
<b>Left leg to 80 POW, 
rest of your body to 20 POW!</b>

08:42.100 --> 08:45.130
<b>Head to 60 POW, 
rest of your body to 40 POW!</b>

08:47.380 --> 08:50.120
<b>Do this for thirty minutes, three times a day.</b>

08:50.120 --> 08:52.530
<b>Add it to your current training menu.</b>

08:52.530 --> 08:53.390
<b>Also...</b>

08:54.610 --> 08:56.640
<b>We'll begin sparring now.</b>

08:57.330 --> 09:01.270
<b>Use <i>Ryu</i> the way I just taught you. 
You can start out slow.</b>

09:01.840 --> 09:05.370
<b>When you're on the defensive, 
determine your opponent's attack power</b>

09:05.370 --> 09:07.970
<b>before defending with<i> Ryu</i>.</b>

09:08.980 --> 09:10.280
<b>With that said...</b>

09:10.280 --> 09:11.280
<b>Begin!</b>

09:11.730 --> 09:13.150
<b>I'll go first, then.</b>

09:14.430 --> 09:17.660
<b><i>Right leg, 55 POW.</i></b>

09:17.660 --> 09:21.660
<b><i>Right leg, 60 POW, I think...</i></b>

09:22.310 --> 09:24.660
<b><i>Left hand, 60 POW.</i></b>

09:27.500 --> 09:30.120
<b><i>Right fist, 80 POW!</i></b>

09:31.800 --> 09:34.560
<b><i>Left elbow, 80 POW!</i></b>

09:40.010 --> 09:43.180
<b><i>If they keep this up daily, for two months,</i></b>

09:43.600 --> 09:47.990
<b><i>they'll be able to fight at 
full speed while using </i>Ryu.</b>

09:49.640 --> 09:52.660
<b><i>After that, it'll be time for the final stage.</i></b>

10:02.160 --> 10:02.910
<b>Okay!</b>

10:03.360 --> 10:04.440
<b>Time for a break!</b>

10:05.150 --> 10:06.890
<b>Thank you very much!</b>

10:06.890 --> 10:07.670
<b>Osu!</b>

10:08.250 --> 10:09.920
<b><i>It's been two weeks.</i></b>

10:10.210 --> 10:12.170
<b><i>They've made a lot of progress...</i></b>

10:12.800 --> 10:15.920
<b>It appears you're ready for the final stage.</b>

10:16.370 --> 10:17.820
<b>The final stage?</b>

10:17.820 --> 10:20.680
<b>Yes, you will begin training in 
the individual categories.</b>

10:21.100 --> 10:21.840
<b>3!</b>

10:21.840 --> 10:22.930
<b>Bingo!</b>

10:23.280 --> 10:24.430
<b>A draw.</b>

10:25.250 --> 10:28.430
<b>You're free to train solely in your own category.</b>

10:28.430 --> 10:30.690
<b>In the case of an Enhancer...</b>

10:30.000 --> 10:40.200
<b>Enhancer</b>

10:30.000 --> 10:40.200
<b>Mani.           Emit.          Enha.         Tran.         Conj.</b>

10:30.690 --> 10:32.790
<b>You'd want to focus on your Enhancer skills,</b>

10:32.790 --> 10:34.090
<b>while training the nearby categories</b>

10:34.090 --> 10:36.840
<b>of Transmuter and Emitter in a balanced fashion.</b>

10:36.840 --> 10:40.200
<b>Then you'll master your own category faster.</b>

10:40.550 --> 10:41.390
<b>9!</b>

10:41.390 --> 10:42.450
<b>Bingo!</b>

10:42.860 --> 10:43.950
<b>A draw.</b>

10:44.520 --> 10:46.090
<b>Good job, Killua.</b>

10:46.090 --> 10:46.950
<b>Same to you.</b>

10:47.400 --> 10:49.040
<b>Then, let's get started.</b>

10:49.040 --> 10:49.960
<b>Osu!</b>

10:50.470 --> 10:52.960
<b>Today, we'll be training in 
the Enhancer category.</b>

10:53.550 --> 10:55.840
<b>Level 1 is smashing rocks.</b>

10:58.160 --> 11:00.220
<b>Crush them like this.</b>

11:00.220 --> 11:03.720
<b>Smash a thousand with a single stone 
in a day, and you clear the level.</b>

11:04.390 --> 11:05.590
<b>And begin!</b>

11:13.300 --> 11:15.030
<b><i>This is pretty tough.</i></b>

11:15.560 --> 11:17.170
<b><i>All I'm doing is</i></b>

11:17.170 --> 11:20.740
<b><i>changing the stone to 100 POW 
at the moment of impact.</i></b>

11:21.640 --> 11:24.740
<b><i>But my</i> Nen <i>is weakening as I go.</i></b>

11:25.270 --> 11:27.500
<b>Oops, it crumbled...</b>

11:27.500 --> 11:29.720
<b>If the stone in your hand breaks, it's over.</b>

11:29.720 --> 11:31.000
<b>Damn!</b>

11:32.860 --> 11:34.630
<b>Damn, I failed!</b>

11:35.110 --> 11:37.880
<b>What are you talking about? 
You did well.</b>

11:38.420 --> 11:39.460
<b>Okay!</b>

11:39.460 --> 11:42.190
<b>Let's do Transmuter training next.</b>

11:42.190 --> 11:44.490
<b>Now, now, don't rush.</b>

11:44.490 --> 11:48.140
<b>You're only allowed to train 
one category per day.</b>

11:48.390 --> 11:49.480
<b>6!</b>

11:49.480 --> 11:51.390
<b>Bingo! A draw.</b>

11:51.870 --> 11:53.050
<b>Again?</b>

11:53.050 --> 11:54.970
<b>These days, we keep getting draws.</b>

11:54.970 --> 11:58.650
<b>That just shows that you've both 
grown accustomed to using <i>Gyo</i>.</b>

11:59.040 --> 12:01.670
<b>But if there's no winner, it's no fun.</b>

12:01.670 --> 12:04.160
<b>Okay, then we'll decide 
with rock-paper-scissors.</b>

12:04.790 --> 12:07.240
<b>The loser does a thousand push-ups!</b>

12:07.600 --> 12:08.700
<b>Sure.</b>

12:08.700 --> 12:10.480
<b>First comes rock...</b>

12:10.480 --> 12:12.150
<b>Rock, paper, scissors!</b>

12:12.150 --> 12:13.620
<b>One more time!</b>

12:14.020 --> 12:15.590
<b>I win!</b>

12:15.590 --> 12:16.650
<b>Damn!</b>

12:16.650 --> 12:17.940
<b>Hey, boys...</b>

12:17.940 --> 12:21.180
<b>Have you heard the theory that 
rock-paper-scissors began in martial arts?</b>

12:21.180 --> 12:21.670
<b>Huh?</b>

12:24.780 --> 12:27.620
<b>Palm</b>

12:25.140 --> 12:28.020
<b>Paper represents a palm attack that 
wrecks the opponent's organs.</b>

12:28.080 --> 12:30.640
<b>Fingers</b>

12:28.430 --> 12:30.600
<b>Scissors represents a finger jab, 
targeting vital points.</b>

12:31.020 --> 12:34.690
<b>Fist</b>

12:31.550 --> 12:34.410
<b>And rock represents a punch with 
the fist to deal external damage.</b>

12:34.730 --> 12:48.870
<b>Evil Fist</b>

12:35.720 --> 12:39.470
<b>Long ago, when martial arts were mistaken</b>

12:39.470 --> 12:43.890
<b>as purely destructive and banned as an evil art,</b>

12:43.890 --> 12:47.880
<b>martial artists trained by playing this game.</b>

12:49.200 --> 12:53.570
<b>And that's how rock-paper-scissors came to be.</b>

12:54.980 --> 12:55.960
<b>You really are old...</b>

12:58.640 --> 12:59.460
<b>That's it!</b>

13:00.420 --> 13:01.080
<b>Eh?</b>

13:03.110 --> 13:04.140
<b>Evil Fist.</b>

13:08.650 --> 13:10.020
<b>Now, everyone.</b>

13:10.020 --> 13:15.480
<b>We have a total of 133 cards from 
90 of the 100 total restricted slot cards.</b>

13:15.690 --> 13:17.660
<b>This is the product of your hard work.</b>

13:17.660 --> 13:18.730
<b>You have our thanks.</b>

13:19.380 --> 13:23.460
<b>Of the remaining 10 cards, we've located 7.</b>

13:23.890 --> 13:25.930
<b>They're as good as ours.</b>

13:26.690 --> 13:30.080
<b>However, Tsezgerra's group has also obtained</b>

13:30.080 --> 13:33.010
<b>an equal number of restricted slot cards.</b>

13:33.520 --> 13:37.790
<b>The final hurdle will likely be a 
showdown against their group.</b>

13:38.380 --> 13:43.130
<b>But I believe we have more, 
and better, spell cards!</b>

13:43.460 --> 13:46.630
<b>Gentlemen, our victory is near!</b>

13:49.410 --> 13:51.840
<b>Can I say something?</b>

13:52.900 --> 13:57.020
<b>These five years have been 
so long, yet so short...</b>

13:58.460 --> 14:02.520
<b>There's something I must tell you.</b>

14:04.140 --> 14:06.030
<b>I am the Bomber.</b>

14:10.360 --> 14:12.050
<b>What? The Bomber?</b>

14:13.100 --> 14:15.410
<b>H-Hey, what are you talking about?</b>

14:15.410 --> 14:16.910
<b>Now, now... Hear me out.</b>

14:17.730 --> 14:20.670
<b>I've placed bombs on all of you.</b>

14:21.660 --> 14:22.670
<b>What was that?</b>

14:23.040 --> 14:24.420
<b>How did you do that?!</b>

14:24.420 --> 14:26.050
<b>Don't mess with us!</b>

14:26.680 --> 14:28.800
<b>Stay calm and listen.</b>

14:37.150 --> 14:38.470
<b>Good grief.</b>

14:39.060 --> 14:41.690
<b>You ruined the explanation I'd planned.</b>

14:42.600 --> 14:44.410
<b>This is my power...</b>

14:44.410 --> 14:46.210
<b>Little Flower.</b>

14:45.480 --> 14:47.440
<b>Fistful of Gunpowder 
Little Flower</b>

14:46.620 --> 14:47.980
<b>As you just saw,</b>

14:47.980 --> 14:50.440
<b>I can blow up anything I grab with my hand.</b>

14:50.980 --> 14:52.950
<b>But it isn't very strong.</b>

14:53.720 --> 14:56.050
<b>He's still alive.</b>

14:56.050 --> 14:56.950
<b>However,</b>

14:57.260 --> 15:00.460
<b>if the bombs on your bodies explode,</b>

15:01.440 --> 15:03.090
<b>you will die.</b>

15:05.870 --> 15:08.210
<b>A bomb? Where is it?</b>

15:08.210 --> 15:12.470
<b>I will now tell you how to disarm the bombs.</b>

15:13.690 --> 15:16.770
<b>Let's start with how I set them.</b>

15:16.770 --> 15:20.270
<b>That was by touching the place on 
the target I wanted to explode,</b>

15:20.270 --> 15:23.350
<b>and saying a certain keyword.</b>

15:23.350 --> 15:24.480
<b>The keyword is</b>

15:25.980 --> 15:26.730
<b>"Bomber."</b>

15:31.400 --> 15:33.560
<b><i>It was the Bomber again.</i></b>

15:35.550 --> 15:38.230
<b><i>Listen... Beware of the Bomber.</i></b>

15:39.540 --> 15:41.230
<b>In order to disarm the bombs,</b>

15:41.230 --> 15:45.890
<b>you must touch my body and say, 
"I caught the Bomber."</b>

15:45.890 --> 15:50.760
<b>However, I also have the Little Flower ability.</b>

15:51.200 --> 15:54.890
<b>I can use this to stop anyone 
who tries to touch me.</b>

15:55.640 --> 15:59.030
<b>You must be very careful as you 
attempt to disarm the bombs.</b>

15:59.540 --> 16:00.410
<b>That's all.</b>

16:08.380 --> 16:09.670
<b>They're armed.</b>

16:10.350 --> 16:13.150
<b>This is the ability Countdown.</b>

16:12.470 --> 16:14.530
<b>Sound of Life
Countdown</b>

16:15.560 --> 16:19.540
<b>Why am I telling you so 
much about my powers?</b>

16:20.120 --> 16:23.040
<b>That's the condition for arming the bombs.</b>

16:23.770 --> 16:26.880
<b>Then you've been waiting for 
the day when all the cards</b>

16:26.880 --> 16:28.550
<b>and members were gathered.</b>

16:28.910 --> 16:31.290
<b>Now, I have a proposition.</b>

16:31.790 --> 16:36.550
<b>I will trade your lives for those 
90 restricted slot cards.</b>

16:37.620 --> 16:41.520
<b>If you agree, I will use an alternative method,</b>

16:41.520 --> 16:44.940
<b>and simultaneously disarm all the bombs.</b>

16:45.670 --> 16:50.390
<b>Do nothing, and all of you will die 
when the counter reaches zero.</b>

16:51.150 --> 16:53.700
<b>You should discuss this amongst yourselves.</b>

16:54.180 --> 16:57.520
<b>I'll be waiting for you at 
Mr. Battera's old mansion.</b>

16:58.230 --> 17:00.570
<b>I don't care who comes, but come alone.</b>

17:01.220 --> 17:03.710
<b>Are you insane?</b>

17:04.120 --> 17:08.660
<b>If we just catch you now and 
disarm the bombs, it's all over.</b>

17:08.660 --> 17:12.160
<b>Do you think you can escape alone?!</b>

17:12.160 --> 17:13.410
<b>Calm yourselves...</b>

17:13.810 --> 17:16.530
<b>If you get too excited, 
the countdown will accelerate.</b>

17:17.070 --> 17:20.710
<b>Because the counter is linked 
to your heartbeat.</b>

17:20.710 --> 17:21.350
<b>What?</b>

17:22.740 --> 17:23.430
<b><i>Book!</i></b>

17:25.100 --> 17:25.880
<b>Crap!</b>

17:28.740 --> 17:30.610
<b>I pray we meet again!</b>

17:30.800 --> 17:32.110
<b>Leave 

Send one target player 
off the island. 

[SR][NORM]</b>

17:31.070 --> 17:32.110
<b><i>Leave on!</i></b>

17:34.290 --> 17:36.030
<b>He escaped outside the game!</b>

17:36.030 --> 17:37.870
<b>We have to follow him...</b>

17:38.140 --> 17:39.060
<b>Wait!</b>

17:39.060 --> 17:42.180
<b>If we leave, the cards inside 
our binders will vanish!</b>

17:42.180 --> 17:43.500
<b>Then what do we do?</b>

17:44.040 --> 17:45.280
<b>Calm down!</b>

17:45.280 --> 17:47.500
<b>It would be unwise to chase him down!</b>

17:48.190 --> 17:51.230
<b>Have you forgotten why we teamed up?</b>

17:51.230 --> 17:53.510
<b>Because we aren't strong fighters!</b>

17:53.910 --> 17:57.900
<b>Does anyone here think they're 
strong enough to defeat him?</b>

17:58.460 --> 17:59.600
<b>It would be impossible.</b>

18:00.450 --> 18:04.020
<b>Given his <i>Nen</i> abilities, he must be powerful.</b>

18:04.830 --> 18:08.660
<b>If all of us attacked him together,</b>

18:08.660 --> 18:11.020
<b>he could use Little Flower to defeat us all.</b>

18:11.750 --> 18:14.280
<b>Damn, we were so close!</b>

18:14.670 --> 18:18.230
<b>First, we must reach a consensus.</b>

18:18.230 --> 18:19.800
<b>Do we hand over the cards?</b>

18:19.800 --> 18:21.610
<b>Or do we fight?</b>

18:21.610 --> 18:23.410
<b>Please give him the cards...</b>

18:24.660 --> 18:25.620
<b>I beg you.</b>

18:28.260 --> 18:31.000
<b>Jispa's running out of time...</b>

18:38.220 --> 18:39.430
<b>That's a surprise.</b>

18:40.080 --> 18:42.870
<b>I was expecting Nickes to come.</b>

18:42.870 --> 18:44.340
<b>I'm surprised, too.</b>

18:44.340 --> 18:46.060
<b>I didn't expect you to be alone...</b>

18:47.970 --> 18:49.260
<b>Sub and Bara.</b>

18:49.630 --> 18:51.310
<b>They're the other bombers.</b>

18:51.830 --> 18:54.320
<b>Now give me your ring.</b>

18:56.130 --> 18:57.180
<b>What's wrong?</b>

18:58.140 --> 18:59.870
<b>I can't turn it over yet...</b>

19:00.530 --> 19:03.430
<b>Actually, we still haven't reached a decision.</b>

19:03.430 --> 19:09.630
<b>And Nickes has requested the Breath 
of Archangel card to save Jispa.</b>

19:09.630 --> 19:10.800
<b>Screw that!</b>

19:10.800 --> 19:12.820
<b>As it stands, neither side can win this!</b>

19:12.820 --> 19:13.590
<b>Eh?</b>

19:13.940 --> 19:17.320
<b>You don't realize how hysterical they are.</b>

19:17.320 --> 19:21.000
<b>If they can't make a decision before 
time expires and they explode,</b>

19:21.000 --> 19:22.970
<b>you'll lose the data in their rings!</b>

19:23.460 --> 19:24.550
<b>But I can—</b>

19:24.550 --> 19:27.470
<b>But you can convince them?</b>

19:28.850 --> 19:31.140
<b>Are you trying to bargain with me?</b>

19:31.680 --> 19:34.240
<b>When striking a bargain,</b>

19:34.240 --> 19:39.490
<b>you have to demonstrate just 
how calm and insane you are.</b>

19:39.930 --> 19:41.140
<b>W-Wait...</b>

19:41.140 --> 19:41.990
<b>If you kill me...</b>

19:45.800 --> 19:47.580
<b>Don't worry.</b>

19:47.580 --> 19:51.140
<b>If you kill a player outside the 
game and take their ring,</b>

19:51.140 --> 19:54.130
<b>the restricted slot data will not vanish.</b>

19:55.000 --> 19:59.130
<b>Well, I doubt you have any of the cards.</b>

20:11.520 --> 20:12.680
<b>A gift.</b>

20:15.490 --> 20:16.670
<b>Puhat!</b>

20:16.670 --> 20:18.400
<b>You won't get another chance.</b>

20:18.400 --> 20:19.490
<b>Okay?</b>

20:19.970 --> 20:20.780
<b>Leave...</b>

20:21.780 --> 20:24.310
<b>The spell card! Leave!</b>

20:25.030 --> 20:26.490
<b>I need to exit, so give it to me.</b>

20:26.860 --> 20:28.160
<b>Hell, no!</b>

20:28.160 --> 20:30.110
<b>Leave is a valuable card.</b>

20:30.110 --> 20:31.500
<b>We can't waste any!</b>

20:31.890 --> 20:33.990
<b>Okay, then...</b>

20:33.990 --> 20:35.650
<b>If I don't return,</b>

20:35.650 --> 20:38.810
<b>it won't be possible to disarm all 
your bombs simultaneously.</b>

20:38.810 --> 20:39.510
<b>What?</b>

20:40.450 --> 20:42.760
<b>I'm also a bomber.</b>

20:44.150 --> 20:46.540
<b>There are three of us.</b>

20:46.540 --> 20:48.690
<b>Well, Genthru's the main one,</b>

20:48.690 --> 20:50.770
<b>and we're just extras.</b>

20:51.900 --> 20:55.460
<b>When the three of us join our 
right thumbs and say the keyword,</b>

20:55.460 --> 20:57.160
<b>the bombs will be destroyed.</b>

20:57.660 --> 21:00.280
<b>That's the alternative method.</b>

21:01.120 --> 21:02.560
<b>Whatever...</b>

21:02.560 --> 21:05.490
<b>I'll take my time returning 
via normal means.</b>

21:05.490 --> 21:07.570
<b>You guys will be dead soon.</b>

21:07.570 --> 21:09.280
<b>Wait! Hold on!</b>

21:11.130 --> 21:12.880
<b>Please use this.</b>

21:16.490 --> 21:18.540
<b>You should have done that 
in the first place, scum!</b>

21:19.480 --> 21:21.990
<b>We'll need Leave cards 
when the deal is made.</b>

21:21.990 --> 21:23.420
<b>Have three ready.</b>

21:23.420 --> 21:24.050
<b>Got it?</b>

21:30.000 --> 21:35.290
<b>Twelve hours before Genthru 
revealed himself as the Bomber,</b>

21:36.670 --> 21:41.030
<b>a single boat attempted to 
invade from the outside.</b>

21:43.270 --> 21:45.490
<b>So it does exist in the real world.</b>

21:47.130 --> 21:50.330
<b>That's gotta be Greed Island.</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:07.470
<b>G.I. Tutorial</b>

23:02.000 --> 23:05.120
<b>Coming up, it's the

23:06.720 --> 23:09.360
<b>Today, we introduce the card Leave.</b>

23:07.510 --> 23:19.040
<b>Leave 

Send one target player

[SR][NORM]</b>

23:09.360 --> 23:11.960
<b>This takes us back to the real world?</b>

23:11.960 --> 23:13.080
<b>That's nice.</b>

23:13.080 --> 23:16.050
<b>If you're going out, leave the free slot cards.</b>

23:16.050 --> 23:17.640
<b>Stupid onliner!</b>

23:17.640 --> 23:18.690
<b>Huh?</b>

<b>Continue!</b>

<b>Next time: Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.</b>

<b>See ya here next week!</b>

<b>Rock, paper, scissors!</b>
