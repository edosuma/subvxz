00:38.080 --> 00:41.542
<i>Ii, I, I, I, iamaman</i>

00:57.182 --> 01:00.227
- you know that song "when i
fall to pieces" by patsy cline?

01:00.269 --> 01:01.270
- Yeah.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.772
- Well that's like her
biggest hit, right?

01:03.814 --> 01:07.192
Then she goes and dies
in a plane crash last march.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.780
She actually fell to pieces.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.658
- You're so romantic, del.
The most.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.617
- I'm romantic.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.619
- You're a germ.

01:17.661 --> 01:20.080
For some reason I'm still
on the hook with ya.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.082
You're my germ.
- Hmm, well...

01:32.759 --> 01:35.262
Oh, I was comfy.

01:35.304 --> 01:38.599
- Ah, sorry.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.603
You know, speaking of germs
and being on the hook and um...

01:42.644 --> 01:45.272
Uh, jeepers, I'm flipping.

01:45.314 --> 01:47.774
- What's your story, weirdo?

01:47.816 --> 01:51.403
- I want-- I wanted to,
ah, I was wondering...

01:51.445 --> 01:53.739
Thinking mainly, just, ah...

01:53.780 --> 01:55.657
- Your hands are shaking.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.285
- I practiced this fifty times
and now I'm gooping it all up.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.037
- Gooping what up?

02:01.121 --> 02:03.540
- You know we've been going
steady for about seven months

02:03.582 --> 02:04.875
and two weeks now, I reckon.
- Uh-huh.

02:04.916 --> 02:09.253
- And um, I'm just gone
over you, sue.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.005
- Okay-

02:10.047 --> 02:11.965
- and I wanted to ask.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.634
- Oh.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.303
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

02:16.345 --> 02:18.805
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
what's wrong, what's wrong?

02:18.847 --> 02:21.308
- No del, del, I've been
waitin' for you to ask me.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.851
Just keep goin'.

02:22.893 --> 02:26.104
- Um, ah,
well, I love you, sue.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.981
' Oh, yes!

02:31.360 --> 02:33.445
- Oh, come on.
Now you've rattled my cage.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.489
- No, you're doing great!

02:35.530 --> 02:37.157
- Ah... okay.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.660
God...
Here, ah, here.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.246
Sue, you gotta go
like this... you gotta.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.956
Oh, dammit.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.792
- Did <i>I</i> get it?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.085
- Dammit, sue.
Come on.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.544
- What is it?

02:49.586 --> 02:51.254
- L just didn't expect it
to go down like this.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.882
Just ask me!

02:53.924 --> 02:55.759
- Christ, sue.
Okay, um, ah...

02:55.801 --> 02:56.843
I want you to be mine forever,

02:56.885 --> 02:58.011
I want to buy you
soda pop and candy

02:58.053 --> 02:59.179
for the rest of our lives
until we die

02:59.221 --> 03:00.263
just take the ring, please.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.686
- Will you just say yes, sue!

03:05.727 --> 03:06.687
Yes?

03:06.728 --> 03:09.356
Yes? Yes?
- Oh yes, I will marry you!

03:09.398 --> 03:11.525
Yes, I will--
- okay, oh--

03:16.697 --> 03:19.199
- I'm going to be
Mrs. howison.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.283
We're going to get married

03:20.325 --> 03:23.286
and everything is gonna be
perfect forever and ever.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.081
<i>- Daaaaddddyyy!</i>

03:27.958 --> 03:29.251
- Did you hear that?

03:32.504 --> 03:34.840
- Shh, shh.
Sue. Sue, listen.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.887
<i>- Daaaaddddyyy!</i>

03:42.597 --> 03:44.182
- Who said that?

03:45.267 --> 03:46.226
- It sounds like
someone's hurt.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.686
We gotta go.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.445
- Isn't this where that--
- listen, sue. Listen.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.406
<i>- Daaaaddddyyy!</i>

04:00.741 --> 04:02.033
- Hello!

04:02.075 --> 04:03.660
Do you need help?!

04:04.202 --> 04:06.955
- Isn't this where that
boy died on Halloween?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.665
- That mongoloid crowley kid?

04:08.707 --> 04:10.041
- That's mean, del.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.835
- Everyone says
he was a monster.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.004
- Sad what happened to him.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.466
- It doesn't matter now.
He's dead.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.344
- Come on, let's go home.
It's gonna rain.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.346
- Someone could need our help.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.599
<i>- Daaaaddddyyy!</i>

04:25.640 --> 04:28.059
- See. Someone's hurt.
Come on. Let's go.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.896
Hear anything?

04:30.937 --> 04:32.981
- Whoever it is,
maybe they're gone.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.525
- Sounds like it's coming
from right over there.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.571
- The hell you doin' out here?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.198
- Where'd you come from?

04:41.239 --> 04:43.074
- That you two
doin' the hollering?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.035
- No. No.
We heard it, too.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.620
Figured someone
was in trouble.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.121
- Let me give you
a word of advice

04:48.163 --> 04:51.124
and listen close 'cause it might
just save your life someday.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.000
Never--

04:52.042 --> 04:54.961
[blood squirting,

04:59.716 --> 05:01.051
- sue, get back to the boat.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.261
Run! Run back to the boat
right now, sue!

05:03.303 --> 05:05.263
What? What?

05:05.472 --> 05:06.681
Oh, fuck.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.850
Fihud]

05:14.523 --> 05:16.066
Please no!

05:16.107 --> 05:17.067
No!

06:21.047 --> 06:22.173
<i>- <i>Once upon</i> a <i>time</i></i>

06:22.215 --> 06:25.760
<i>there was a boy
named Victor crowley.</i>

06:25.802 --> 06:28.305
<i>He was born horribly deformed.</i>

06:28.346 --> 06:31.641
<i>Part of a voodoo curse
put on his parents.</i>

06:32.517 --> 06:35.770
<i>Other children were
cruel to Victor</i>

06:35.812 --> 06:38.982
<i>so his daddy kept him
hidden in his house</i>

06:39.024 --> 06:41.359
<i>out in honey island swamp.</i>

06:42.736 --> 06:44.362
<i>One Halloween night</i>

06:44.404 --> 06:47.949
<i>some mean kids threw
firecrackers at his house.</i>

06:48.658 --> 06:50.994
<i>They were just tying
to scare Victor outside</i>

06:51.036 --> 06:52.787
<i>so they could see him</i>

06:52.829 --> 06:55.206
<i>but the house caught fire.</i>

06:56.625 --> 06:58.335
<i>When Victor's daddy got home</i>

06:58.376 --> 07:02.255
<i>he tried to chop down the door
with a hatchet and save him.</i>

07:02.297 --> 07:05.383
<i>He didn't know that Victor
was on the other side</i>

07:05.425 --> 07:07.135
<i>trying to get out.</i>

07:07.969 --> 07:09.638
<i>It was an accident...</i>

07:09.679 --> 07:12.349
<i>But he hit him in the face
with that hatchet</i>

07:12.390 --> 07:15.185
<i>and poor Victor crowley died.</i>

07:16.603 --> 07:18.688
<i>Legend says that
that voodoo curse</i>

07:18.730 --> 07:21.942
<i>turned Victor crowley
into a ghost.</i>

07:21.983 --> 07:26.529
<i>That he returns to
honey island swamp every night.</i>

07:27.697 --> 07:29.824
<i>And if you listen,</i>

07:29.866 --> 07:33.203
<i>you can still hear
Victor crowley</i>

07:33.244 --> 07:35.872
<i>roaming in the bayou,</i>

07:35.914 --> 07:38.875
<i>crying for his daddy.</i>

07:40.126 --> 07:42.379
<i>But beware,</i>

07:42.420 --> 07:45.382
<i>for once you've heard his voice...</i>

07:45.423 --> 07:47.258
<i>It's too late.</i>

07:48.927 --> 07:51.888
<i>You're already dead.</i>

08:08.822 --> 08:10.615
- Yes, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.617
Welcome back.
Welcome back.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.913
My guest today is the lone
survivor of the horrific

08:16.955 --> 08:18.206
honey island swamp massacre

08:18.248 --> 08:20.834
that happened ten years ago
this month.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.920
Authorities still don't know
exactly how many were murdered

08:23.962 --> 08:26.089
due to the fact that
so many of the victims

08:26.131 --> 08:27.966
could only be identified

08:28.008 --> 08:31.094
by the pieces
uncovered at the scene.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.513
But to date
they still speculate

08:33.554 --> 08:36.433
that at least forty
were left dead

08:36.474 --> 08:39.436
at the hands of who
is now known as only

08:39.477 --> 08:41.104
"the bayou butcher".

08:41.145 --> 08:44.482
Only one man survived
the tragedy and his book,

08:44.524 --> 08:47.360
<i>I, survivor,
hits shelves</i> today.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.445
So,

08:48.486 --> 08:51.781
help me in welcoming
back to the Sabrina show,

08:51.823 --> 08:54.367
Andrew yong.
Yes.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.328
Andrew.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.670
Welcome back
to the show, Andrew.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.839
- It's uh,
great to be here, Sabrina.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.176
- It's the ten year anniversary
of this gruesome,

09:11.217 --> 09:13.511
gruesome tragedy.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.221
How you holdin' up
a decade later?

09:15.263 --> 09:17.140
- The first few years...

09:17.182 --> 09:18.975
With all the press...
The interviews...

09:19.017 --> 09:21.561
When I first did your show...
Were tough.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.855
Having to basically
relive the whole thing

09:23.897 --> 09:25.690
over and over again
every single day

09:25.732 --> 09:27.776
was a never ending nightmare.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.861
- And of course there
was the 2008 trial,

09:29.903 --> 09:31.696
the civil lawsuits,
the accusations, the...

09:31.738 --> 09:33.865
- Our divorce.
- Uh-huh.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.618
Authorities never did find
any evidence to support

09:36.659 --> 09:38.703
your claims about
Victor crowley,

09:38.745 --> 09:43.958
and they did find your DNA
on two of the victims.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.880
Many still believe that
you are the bayou butcher.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.800
- The whole DNA thing
is still a mystery

09:51.841 --> 09:55.345
but as we all know I was
of course found innocent

09:55.386 --> 09:58.723
on all charges and exonerated
across the board.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.142
Yes. Thank you...

10:02.685 --> 10:04.145
Ma'am.

10:04.562 --> 10:09.692
- So, I, survivor,
tell me more about it.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.527
- Did you read it?

10:10.568 --> 10:13.029
- It's on my list, yeah...

10:13.071 --> 10:17.075
- Well, this book was
probably the hardest thing

10:17.117 --> 10:18.576
I've ever done in my life.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.747
- Wow, besides single-handedly
defeating the alleged ghost

10:22.789 --> 10:26.918
of local legend "Victor crowley"?
- Not alleged.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.586
- There hasn't been
any sightings

10:28.628 --> 10:30.922
or incidents
since the tragedy.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.259
Why wait ten years
to write this book?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.094
- I had started
and stopped a few times.

10:36.136 --> 10:36.845
It was hard. I mean,

10:36.886 --> 10:38.721
obviously I've never
written a book before.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.348
- Obviously.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.310
- But thankfully they paired me
with a far more experienced

10:44.352 --> 10:46.104
writer to help me
named Joe knetter.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.524
As you know, I was just
a paramedic before all of this.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.528
- Ten years later!
You are like the oj Simpson

10:53.570 --> 10:55.113
of honey island swamp,
wouldn't you say?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.614
- Ah, no, I wouldn't.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.742
- We'll be right back with more
ghost stories from Andrew yong

10:59.784 --> 11:02.162
when the Sabrina show returns.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.459
- He is so hot.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.296
I want to have
fifteen babies with him.

11:11.337 --> 11:15.717
- Babe, I'm sitting right here.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.261
- We already agreed
Andrew yong is my free pass.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.721
- Yeah, well that was before
there was a chance

11:19.762 --> 11:21.139
you might actually meet him

11:21.181 --> 11:22.348
because free passes don't work

11:22.390 --> 11:24.058
if you're going to meet
the person in real life.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.727
- Wait, how is that fair?

11:25.768 --> 11:27.604
You could run into
a celebrity anywhere.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.355
Especially once
our movie gets made.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.232
We'll be going to premieres,
Hollywood parties...

11:31.274 --> 11:33.484
- Andrew yong
is not a celebrity.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.903
- Is that jealousy I detect?

11:34.944 --> 11:36.321
- No, it's not jealousy.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.989
Jealousy?
Yeah, right.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.532
This guy is so full of shit

11:39.574 --> 11:42.243
he could probably open up,
like, a shit restaurant...

11:42.285 --> 11:45.997
With shit... whatever.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.458
- Ooh, sick burn, Alex.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.959
- Will you just stay
out of this, rose.

11:50.001 --> 11:50.960
I'm tired.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.295
- You used all the hot water.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.088
- I took a shower last night.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.298
- It's your fault.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.342
- It's always your fault, Alex.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.344
Rose!

11:59.385 --> 12:00.803
- They're just boobs, Chloe.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.806
- Friends aren't supposed to
see each other naked this much.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.016
- I'm okay with it.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.059
- Don't even.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.227
- Hey, you're the one who said

12:07.268 --> 12:09.812
I couldn't have my own room,
Ms. director.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.482
If I have to share this
condemned hotel with you

12:12.523 --> 12:14.901
and listen to you two awkwardly
do it all night long,

12:14.943 --> 12:17.320
I think you can deal with
my tits for a few minutes.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.072
- Wait, you heard us?
- Depends.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.157
Do you mean the minute long
one at around midnight

12:21.199 --> 12:24.661
or three minutes
at around two-thirty?

12:24.702 --> 12:26.621
"Do you think
she can hear us?"

12:26.663 --> 12:29.249
"Oh, no,
she's definitely asleep."

12:29.290 --> 12:32.710
"Oh, stop! Stop!
Exit only, exit only!"

12:32.752 --> 12:33.836
Which by the way, Chloe,

12:33.878 --> 12:36.756
you're missing out
in a major way, you prude.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.050
- I'm sorry that you
couldn't have your own room

12:39.092 --> 12:40.510
but we're on a budget, okay?

12:40.551 --> 12:41.511
- Clearly.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.222
I think I just got gonorrhea
from the shower.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.811
I need to stop on the way to
get more supplies for my kit.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.688
- Wait, but we'll miss
the book signing.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.524
- Do you want fake blood
in your horror movie or not?

12:54.565 --> 12:56.901
- Alright, well
let's get a move on then.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.070
Alex, change your clothes.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.907
- Hey, you know what
I've always been wondering?

13:02.949 --> 13:05.368
Why do they movie
commercials "trailers",

13:05.410 --> 13:08.454
if they play them
before the movie?

13:09.706 --> 13:12.750
- Alex, you had one job.

13:13.084 --> 13:13.918
- What?

13:27.223 --> 13:29.475
- I got the face wrong,
didn't I?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.645
- There, ah, wasn't any other
daytime show I could've done

13:32.687 --> 13:33.896
besides my ex-wife's?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.024
- Sabrina's producers offered
the most amount of money.

13:36.065 --> 13:36.899
And who cares?

13:36.941 --> 13:39.152
As your publicist,
I'm telling you,

13:39.193 --> 13:40.320
you killed it in there.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.571
- No, I didn't.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.364
That was a disaster, Kathleen.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.366
God and she still
treats me like a criminal.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.201
- People are gonna think
whatever they wanna think,

13:47.243 --> 13:48.453
as long as they buy your book,

13:48.494 --> 13:50.621
why do you care
if they hate read it?

13:51.372 --> 13:52.874
- It's a good book.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.043
- It's an amazing book.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.295
- I think people are going
to be very moved by it.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.379
- Are you kidding me?

13:58.421 --> 14:00.381
I think everyone in the world
is gonna love it.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.133
How could they not?

14:03.092 --> 14:04.218
- You haven't read it either?

14:04.260 --> 14:05.887
- It's on my list.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.555
- Murderer!

14:07.597 --> 14:09.390
- I was exonerated!

14:09.432 --> 14:11.601
Almost a decade ago,
but everywhere I go,

14:11.642 --> 14:13.394
people still act
like I, I, i--

14:13.436 --> 14:15.396
- like you chopped up forty or
something people in the swamp

14:15.438 --> 14:18.232
and you blamed it on
a make believe ghost?

14:18.274 --> 14:19.233
- Whose side are you on?

14:19.275 --> 14:21.110
- Come on.
We gotta go.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.905
Listen to me.
It's almost over.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.782
All you have to do is cash out

14:25.823 --> 14:27.617
on the anniversary
of this bullshit

14:27.658 --> 14:28.826
and then you
put it behind you

14:28.868 --> 14:30.203
and you spend
the rest of your life

14:30.244 --> 14:32.455
counting your money
back in Japan.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.999
- I'm from Baton Rouge.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.543
And I'm Chinese!

14:39.462 --> 14:41.381
- Are you sure?

14:51.974 --> 14:54.435
- Hey, you're shaking.

14:54.477 --> 14:55.478
- No, I'm not.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.313
- I can see the outline
of your excitement

14:57.355 --> 14:59.315
dripping down
the inside of your jeans.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.692
- You're not helping, rose.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.569
Do these jeans make me
look unprofessional?

15:03.611 --> 15:04.737
- No, you look great.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.906
- I mean, if I was presenting
myself as a director,

15:06.948 --> 15:08.908
I probably wouldn't
have worn jeans.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.702
I'm losing my shit, you guys.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.622
We're about the meet the only
guy to ever see Victor crowley

15:14.664 --> 15:15.581
and live to tell about it.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.207
- Yeah, yeah.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.793
I mean, if you believe in
that kinda stuff, right.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.461
- Are you with me or not?

15:20.503 --> 15:23.005
- Of course I'm with you, yeah.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.507
I believe in you, Chloe.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.844
I believe in you, I don't
believe in any of this stuff

15:27.885 --> 15:29.595
but I love you, Chloe,

15:29.637 --> 15:32.265
and I know for a fact
that one day

15:32.306 --> 15:33.891
I am going to see you
win an academy--

15:33.933 --> 15:35.768
- it's him.
Oh my god, that's him.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.146
- Excuse me.
Thank you.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.480
Excuse me, he's here.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.065
Yes, he is.
Okay...

15:41.107 --> 15:42.733
- Ah-huh, yeah.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.278
Really?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.115
Oh my god.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.826
- Hang on here.

15:56.205 --> 16:00.835
One, two...

16:00.877 --> 16:02.879
Oh, this is a big one...

16:02.920 --> 16:04.422
Three.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.507
All fixed.
Perfect.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.389
- There you go.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.226
- Oh my god.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.936
Hi.
- Hi.

16:18.978 --> 16:19.979
- Do you mind?

16:20.021 --> 16:22.482
It's Kristina,
Kristina with a k.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.650
- Sure, Kristina with a k.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.569
Um...

16:26.611 --> 16:29.739
Should I...
Which... which one?

16:29.780 --> 16:32.992
- Ooh, could you do one
to Kristina with a k

16:33.034 --> 16:35.119
and one for my dad?

16:35.161 --> 16:37.163
His name's bill...

16:37.205 --> 16:38.706
With a b.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.417
- How much do you wanna bet

16:41.459 --> 16:43.169
that every other person
in this line

16:43.211 --> 16:45.213
is pitching him
on being in their movie.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.340
He's probably going to be
in every single movie now.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.674
- Probably not though.

16:48.716 --> 16:49.967
- Well, when we get back
from this trip,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.928
I'm going to have
a kick-ass mock trailer

16:51.969 --> 16:54.096
to add to my
presentation package.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.350
But, if could also tell
potential investors

16:57.391 --> 17:00.686
that I got the real
Andrew yong

17:00.728 --> 17:04.648
to, to agree to be in
the actual movie...

17:04.690 --> 17:07.193
Can you imagine what
they would say?

17:07.234 --> 17:10.738
- Yeah, they'd be like,
"who the fuck is that?"

17:10.780 --> 17:12.906
Nope.
No, they'd say,

17:12.949 --> 17:15.034
"wow, it's the Asian
tom Hanks,

17:15.076 --> 17:17.244
here's a hundred
million dollars."

17:17.286 --> 17:19.704
- Can I have the
production folder, please?

17:21.582 --> 17:23.416
- You're holding it.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.962
- That's right.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.047
- You see this?!
Huh!?

17:28.089 --> 17:29.882
Look at him!
You murderer!

17:29.924 --> 17:30.967
- Okay-

17:31.008 --> 17:32.760
- look at his face!

17:32.802 --> 17:33.928
His name was Chad

17:33.970 --> 17:36.055
and he was my brother
and you murdered him!

17:36.097 --> 17:37.890
- Oh god,
I'm sorry for your loss

17:37.932 --> 17:39.433
but I lost people
in that swamp, too.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.726
- Yeah, I know you got off,

17:40.768 --> 17:42.061
but you're not gonna
get away with this.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.146
You better watch
your fucking back.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.148
You know what?
Keep it.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.984
I hope his face haunts
you to your grave!

17:48.025 --> 17:49.360
- It's okay, skip.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.570
He'll get what's
coming to him.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.405
He'll get his.

17:53.114 --> 17:58.369
You...
Are going to burn in hell.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.418
Do I have any security?

18:05.459 --> 18:07.461
- You're an ex-paramedic,
not Steven Tyler.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.255
Oh, this is Kathleen.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.173
- Hey there.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.801
- Yeah, I'm not
gonna buy your book...

18:13.843 --> 18:16.429
Probably just torrent
the audio version,

18:16.470 --> 18:20.391
but ah,
can you sign this?

18:22.810 --> 18:25.187
You can make it out to Linus.

18:25.229 --> 18:29.942
- Sorry, I, I, i
don't sign... those.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.153
- I just saw you
sign that girl's tits.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.280
What are you, homophobic?

18:34.322 --> 18:35.781
- Kathleen?

18:36.198 --> 18:37.533
Kathleen!

18:37.575 --> 18:39.785
I can't stop looking at it.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.371
- What's your problem?
Just sign my cock.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.874
- I'd really like to--
Kathleen, seriously?

18:44.915 --> 18:46.709
- Hey!
Get out here with that shit!

18:46.751 --> 18:47.918
Go on.
Move!

18:49.253 --> 18:51.088
- I'm telling everybody
on the Facebook

18:51.130 --> 18:52.632
that you're a homophobe.

18:52.673 --> 18:53.799
- Oh, whatever.

18:53.841 --> 18:58.054
Most people call him a murder,
so take your best shot!

18:58.095 --> 18:59.805
- Thanks?

19:08.064 --> 19:10.524
- Hi, ah, Mr. yong.
My name is Chloe Benjamin.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.318
I messaged you on Twitter.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.278
Do you remember?

19:14.320 --> 19:18.949
Um, I'm making a movie
about the crowley murders...

19:18.991 --> 19:20.785
<i>Hatchet face.</i>

19:20.826 --> 19:24.914
Um, we're here in New Orleans
shooting a mock trailer

19:24.955 --> 19:28.626
to help raise the rest
of the financing for the film

19:28.668 --> 19:31.128
and I wanted to ask
you in person,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.130
well, I was wondering if--

19:33.172 --> 19:33.881
- sorry, kids.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.050
We just got the offer
of a lifetime.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.635
We are leaving now.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.636
- No, no more appearances
or signings.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.304
I told you, alright.
- Oh my god, totally.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.181
Except for this one.
- Kathleen, I just--

19:42.223 --> 19:43.849
- okay-sorry!
Sorry, signing's off.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.393
- No, but we flew
a long way to be here.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.602
- Ah, well that's really great

19:46.644 --> 19:47.937
but the autograph
session is done.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.606
- Ma'am, we are making a movie
about the 2007 massacre

19:50.648 --> 19:51.440
and we just need a minute--

19:51.482 --> 19:52.942
- I can't wait to see it,
Wes craven.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.610
Excuse me, everybody,

19:54.652 --> 19:58.114
but mr yong has
a family emergency.

19:58.155 --> 20:01.158
Thank you so much for coming
and enjoy the book.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.119
Come on. Come on.
- Um, wait but...

20:03.160 --> 20:05.037
- Now! Fast!

20:06.706 --> 20:07.748
<i>- Sonâ€œ!-</i>

20:07.790 --> 20:09.750
- excuse me.
- Andrew, wait!

20:10.626 --> 20:12.628
- I told you that guy
was a douchebag.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.255
- Come on, Chloe.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.341
- Absolutely not!

20:17.383 --> 20:19.468
- <i>It's real crime stories,
Andrew.</i>

20:19.510 --> 20:21.429
It's primetime
network television.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.930
It's just one more interview.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.640
- I don't care what
show it's for, okay.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.641
I've told you
a thousand times,

20:25.683 --> 20:27.476
I'm never going back
to that swamp.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.228
- It's two hours,
three hours tops.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.604
I mean, maybe five hours,
whatever,

20:30.646 --> 20:33.149
but they take us
and a small camera crew

20:33.190 --> 20:36.694
and a host and they fly us
in the private network jet--

20:36.736 --> 20:37.695
fancy, huh?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.947
And then they have you
looking down on the area,

20:39.989 --> 20:41.991
all you know,
sad and reflective,

20:42.032 --> 20:42.908
and whatever the fuck,

20:42.950 --> 20:45.244
and then we land
and they get the exclusive

20:45.286 --> 20:47.121
and then we get paid.
Well, you,

20:47.163 --> 20:49.498
you get paid a fuck ton.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.709
- I'm not doing an interview
at the site of the murders.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.669
- Yes, we are
and we need to hurry up

20:53.711 --> 20:55.212
because we need
to stop at my place

20:55.254 --> 20:56.589
so I can change my outfit again

20:56.630 --> 20:58.924
because I can't meet the
real crime producers in this.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.384
- Stop, Kathleen, okay?

21:00.426 --> 21:01.886
No.

21:03.053 --> 21:03.804
- It's okay.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.347
I have another outfit
in my trunk.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.182
It's perfect.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.517
- Over my dead body
am I going back.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.478
For any amount of money.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.818
- They offered
six-hundred thousand.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.617
But I got them
up to a million.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.415
- I feel sick.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.542
- I didn't realize you
were so scared of flying.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.503
- I'm not scared of flying,

21:35.544 --> 21:37.254
I'm scared of what's in
that swamp.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.465
- You mean the swamp that's
as busy as bourbon street

21:39.507 --> 21:41.008
with all the tours
they do now?

21:41.050 --> 21:44.178
There's nothing left in there
but a bunch of morbid sickos

21:44.220 --> 21:46.680
wanting to see the scene
of a mass murder.

21:46.722 --> 21:52.144
Ugh, people today
are just broken.

21:52.186 --> 21:55.648
Would you like a Xanax,
Ambien, valium,

21:55.689 --> 21:58.651
Vicodin, dilaudid,
Percocet, oxy?

21:59.777 --> 22:01.779
I've got heavier stuff
if you want it.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.864
- I'm good, thanks.
- Okay.

22:08.619 --> 22:11.038
I get migraines
when I do stuff.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.208
Oh, excuse me,
Mr. pilot.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.042
- Yes, ma'am.

22:15.084 --> 22:19.380
- I didn't see the Indiana
Jones plane landing things.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.090
How do we land in the water?

22:21.131 --> 22:23.342
- This aircraft
doesn't do water landings.

22:23.384 --> 22:25.553
- No. We're actually landing
on a private runway

22:25.594 --> 22:28.597
in slidell about two miles
outside of honey island.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.433
- So we do have
to get on a boat?

22:31.475 --> 22:33.018
- We don't.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.106
- I feel so sick.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.574
- Stop it.
I was fixing my shoe.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.952
- Give me that back.
Give me that back.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.453
Sit down.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.413
Relax.

22:52.454 --> 22:55.040
Not in front of the crew.
Could you be professional?

22:55.082 --> 22:56.542
- Child, please.
You aint foolin' no one,

22:56.584 --> 22:58.460
everyone knows
you two are bangin'.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.132
- So who's interviewing me?

23:03.173 --> 23:05.593
- Oh, you know,
probably like ed Bradley

23:05.634 --> 23:07.595
or someone respected.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.263
- Ed Bradley died.

23:09.305 --> 23:13.142
- Ah, would you look at that.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.373
<i>- Ahh, good afternoon.</i>

23:36.415 --> 23:40.127
<i>This is, ahh,
co-pilot Craig borden.</i>

23:40.169 --> 23:43.756
<i>Ahh, flying time
to slidell today,</i>

23:43.797 --> 23:47.593
<i>a, ahh,
quick thirty five minutes.</i>

23:50.679 --> 23:54.099
<i>Ahh, apologies for the delay.</i>

23:54.141 --> 23:58.771
<i>We had, ahh, minor issue
with our right engine,</i>

23:58.812 --> 24:04.693
<i>but we are... all clear
and... ready to go.</i>

24:06.111 --> 24:07.988
Smooth <i>skies</i> today,

24:08.030 --> 24:09.114
<i>though,ahh,</i>

24:09.156 --> 24:14.161
<i>might have some minor turbulence
over, ahhh, Jean lafitte.</i>

24:17.081 --> 24:19.625
<i>Ahh,</i> word from the tower

24:19.667 --> 24:25.130
<i>is that we are...
Second in line for takeoff.</i>

24:29.677 --> 24:33.472
<i>Ahhhhh...</i>

24:39.103 --> 24:41.438
- L just wanna point out
that it's kinda fucked up

24:41.480 --> 24:42.815
that you could
afford to pay a guy

24:42.856 --> 24:44.274
for a private overnight tour

24:44.316 --> 24:47.569
while I share the same room
in motel hell with you two.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.363
- She didn't have
to pay this guy.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.990
- Oh.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.701
- Stop it.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.661
Turns out one of the
tour guides here

24:55.703 --> 24:58.122
just so happens to be
an aspiring actor,

24:58.163 --> 24:59.957
so I promised him
a part in the movie

24:59.999 --> 25:01.250
and that he'd get
his sag card

25:01.291 --> 25:03.002
if he'd do this
for us for free.

25:03.043 --> 25:06.547
- Already promising actors
things you can't deliver on?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.757
You might make it in
Hollywood after all, Chloe.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.551
- Do you guys see this?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.928
This is disgusting.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.014
Victor crowley dolls.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.307
- There are collectors
that will pay a fortune

25:17.349 --> 25:19.518
for one of gacy's clown
paintings or whatever,

25:19.560 --> 25:21.186
a Victor crowley doll
is nothing.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.022
- Yeah but what kind
of a sick freak

25:23.063 --> 25:25.816
buys something like that
for a child? That's...

25:26.650 --> 25:28.485
- For my niece.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.621
Well alright, pilgrims.

25:39.663 --> 25:43.375
Let's get a movin',
we're losin' daylight.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.171
You lookin' at me?

25:47.212 --> 25:48.213
- It's "talking".

25:48.255 --> 25:50.090
Are you looking at me?

25:50.132 --> 25:52.509
- I think it's "talking to".

25:52.551 --> 25:55.054
Wait 'til they get a load of me.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.056
Hey.
Alright, guess this one.

25:58.015 --> 26:04.396
It's me, Christopher walken.

26:04.438 --> 26:05.856
Christopher walken.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.399
I'm still work shopping
that one.

26:07.441 --> 26:10.194
What's up? I'm Dillon.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.488
Actor.
Tour guide.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.531
But mostly actor.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.784
- A blow job would have
been way less painful.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.036
- Hey, Dillon.
I'm Chloe the director.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.162
- Oh, yeah,
we spoke on the phone.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.581
- Yeah, uh--
- did you check out my...

26:22.623 --> 26:23.707
- Sure.
- Okay.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.418
- This is Alex, my boyfriend,
uh, who's helping out

26:26.460 --> 26:28.378
and playing the role of Benjamin Schafer.
- Great.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.671
- And this is rose,

26:29.713 --> 26:32.674
she's doing makeup effects
and everything else.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.385
- Rose, by any other name.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.887
- I have a dick.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.013
- So where'd you study?

26:38.055 --> 26:40.057
- I went to undergrad
at Salem state.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.559
- No, where'd you study acting?

26:42.601 --> 26:44.186
- Ah, I never studied that.

26:44.228 --> 26:45.521
- Alright,
well don't sweat it, okay.

26:45.562 --> 26:46.605
I'll show you the ropes.

26:46.647 --> 26:49.066
I'm the king of improv
in Jean lafitte parish.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.734
- Awesome.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.820
- Headshots.
I brought em'.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.738
Standard headshot.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.367
Construction worker.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.787
- Sure.
- Army guy.

27:01.829 --> 27:05.082
And then I printed out a regular
headshot but black and white.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.625
I didn't know if this
was a period piece

27:06.667 --> 27:08.043
or anything like that so...

27:08.085 --> 27:10.462
- You know this is just like
a fake trailer though, right?

27:10.504 --> 27:13.715
- Did I tell you that every
character in my script

27:13.757 --> 27:16.218
is named after
an actual victim?

27:16.260 --> 27:18.929
- I got it but I didn't get,
you know, a script...

27:18.971 --> 27:20.097
- Boo!

27:23.392 --> 27:24.768
If we have to get on
a boat anyway,

27:24.810 --> 27:27.437
explain to me again,
why we gotta fly in?

27:33.819 --> 27:36.071
- We're flying in because
we're getting footage of you

27:36.113 --> 27:37.781
looking down at the spot
at magic hour,

27:37.823 --> 27:39.533
you know,
right as the sun sets.

27:39.575 --> 27:40.951
- I wasn't asking you.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.954
- In fact,
we should get you mic'd.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.789
Austin!

27:45.831 --> 27:49.126
Can you please get
a microphone on Mr. yong?

27:49.168 --> 27:50.919
- Copy that.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.385
- Casey.
- Yeah.

27:58.427 --> 27:59.928
- What do you need
to be ready to shoot?

27:59.970 --> 28:01.597
- Just sound, last looks
and I'm ready to roll.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.307
- Oh, did I hear,
"last looks"?

28:03.348 --> 28:06.476
- Hold tight just one second
until audids finished, Jay.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.061
Not much room
to move in here.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.813
- Copy that.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.857
- So no lights for this,
Casey?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.484
- Are you kidding?

28:15.485 --> 28:17.863
No, no, no lights at all.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.282
Unless I can plug
them into your asshole.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.201
- I heard that.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.163
Hey, pledge, how about
a hot brick standing by?

28:26.205 --> 28:28.123
- Yeah, ten-one.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.167
- It's "copy", Zach.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.793
Ten-one means
you're taking a piss.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.421
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
Copy.

28:34.463 --> 28:35.589
- Oh, Mr. Zach.

28:35.631 --> 28:38.300
Do you happen to know
what a ten-two is?

28:38.342 --> 28:41.303
- Ah, is it, poop?

28:41.345 --> 28:42.930
- Ding, ding, ding, ding,
what do you know,

28:42.971 --> 28:44.139
the pledge knows his shit.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.391
You sir, may have
a nice long future

28:46.433 --> 28:47.935
in production after all.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.243
- I thought there
would be tours going.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.995
- Yeah, most tours only run
until midnight on weekends

29:07.037 --> 29:10.249
but after about four years,
business slowed down.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.833
Now there's just not
enough customers

29:11.875 --> 29:13.835
to make weeknight
tours worth it.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.003
- Babe, are you hearing this?

29:15.045 --> 29:15.879
The reviews are in,

29:15.921 --> 29:17.506
Victor crowley's
not relevant anymore.

29:17.547 --> 29:18.465
- Whoa!
Not true, man.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.300
They're shooting like,
five Victor crowley movies

29:20.342 --> 29:21.176
as we speak.

29:21.218 --> 29:22.719
Two are like
straight up slashers,

29:22.761 --> 29:25.222
one's some jump scare
ghost movie thing,

29:25.264 --> 29:27.683
and I think the
other two are remakes.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.017
- Remakes?
- Whatever.

29:29.059 --> 29:31.520
Fuck those other movies,
they're all gonna suck.

29:31.561 --> 29:33.105
- How do you know?

29:33.146 --> 29:35.065
- Because they didn't cast me.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.693
- Hey, how you doin', buddy?
I'm Austin.

29:37.734 --> 29:38.777
- Andrew.
- All right.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.988
Nice to meet you, Andrew.
I need you to do me a favor.

29:41.029 --> 29:44.324
Just drop the back of that cord
right down your shirt there.

29:46.243 --> 29:46.743
- Like that?

29:46.785 --> 29:50.038
- That is perfect.
Thank you.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.498
- Where in New York
are you from?

29:51.540 --> 29:53.166
- Let me guess,
the accent gives it away?

29:54.543 --> 29:56.712
Staten island actually.
You ever been?

29:56.753 --> 29:57.629
- No-

29:57.671 --> 29:58.922
- well, you gotta go.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.091
It's the Jewel of the
east coast, my man.

30:01.133 --> 30:04.094
It's gorgeous, but I had
to come down to Louisiana

30:04.136 --> 30:06.263
about nine years ago
because it was booming

30:06.305 --> 30:07.514
for production jobs,

30:07.556 --> 30:08.640
now I'm probably
going to Atlanta

30:08.682 --> 30:10.642
because that's where it's at.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.145
- So, what,
no interest in la?

30:13.186 --> 30:15.397
- No, I'm not an asshole.

30:19.276 --> 30:20.360
You were really there

30:20.402 --> 30:23.155
when all that crazy shit
went down ten years ago?

30:23.905 --> 30:24.740
- I was.

30:24.781 --> 30:29.077
- And you actually saw
that swamp monster ghost guy,

30:29.119 --> 30:31.330
Vincent Crosby or whatever?

30:31.955 --> 30:33.123
- I did.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.250
- Dude, that is funny.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.919
- Yeah, it's hilarious.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.881
- Hey, Chloe.
- What's up?

30:40.922 --> 30:42.924
- How do you pronounce this?

30:43.759 --> 30:45.886
- It's, urn... I don't know.

30:45.927 --> 30:50.098
"Una-dolama ree-culla
ey-yoo-neesus" whatever.

30:50.140 --> 30:51.600
It doesn't matter if you
get it exactly right,

30:51.641 --> 30:52.893
'cause no one is going
to know the difference.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.019
<i>'</i> Hey, babe!

30:54.061 --> 30:55.437
What language is that?

30:55.479 --> 30:56.563

30:56.605 --> 30:59.024
but it's supposed to be
the actual voodoo curse

30:59.066 --> 31:01.068
that shyann crowley
put on her husband

31:01.109 --> 31:03.195
and the slutty nurse
that he knocked up.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.571
- How do you know that?

31:04.613 --> 31:05.781
- The Internet told me.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.909
- Hey, you know, YouTube
is an excellent resource

31:08.950 --> 31:10.577
for black magic
and occult rituals.

31:10.619 --> 31:13.080
- Okay, I thought it was
just cat videos

31:13.121 --> 31:14.915
and dipshits
watching other dip fshits

31:14.956 --> 31:16.041
play video games.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.292
- I watch a lot of that.

31:17.334 --> 31:20.045
- Hey, you know maybe we can
see how someone else says it...

31:20.087 --> 31:21.922
- <i>The correct way
to say the curse</i>

31:21.963 --> 31:24.925
<i>that created Victor crowley,
necru...</i>

31:24.966 --> 31:26.301
- Say a few words for me.

31:27.260 --> 31:28.095
- Words?

31:28.136 --> 31:30.847
- Yeah, just like,
count to ten or something.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.140
- One, two...

31:32.182 --> 31:35.644

31:36.812 --> 31:38.522
- Three...

Victor crowley?

31:58.500 --> 32:01.169
It's only the most important
part of the movie I'm making.

32:01.211 --> 32:02.212
- I know, I'm just saying,

32:02.254 --> 32:03.964
we could do the
voiceover in post.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.966

of rose's mouth

and stay out of it.

I'm gonna stay out of it.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.453
- What?

32:34.494 --> 32:35.287
- Up.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.580
Up,up,up,up,up-
- oh, oh.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.123
- There you go.
Find your happy place up there.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.000
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Good.

32:42.210 --> 32:45.922
So is it true that you were
there when everything went down

32:45.964 --> 32:46.715
ten years ago?

32:46.756 --> 32:48.842
- Yes.
I saw Victor crowley.

32:48.884 --> 32:51.178
- Ooh, freaky, mmm.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.722
But I got to know,

32:53.763 --> 32:55.223
what did he look like?

32:58.602 --> 32:59.853
Listen,
don't be scared, honey,

32:59.895 --> 33:01.771
it takes a lot more than
a little bit of turbulence

33:01.813 --> 33:02.564
to take down
a big old plane.

33:02.606 --> 33:03.773
I've been traveling
internationally,

33:03.815 --> 33:05.901
in fact, Japan is one
of my favorite places--

33:07.402 --> 33:09.529
- help! Help me!

33:14.075 --> 33:16.745
I'm burning!
I'm burning!

33:29.382 --> 33:32.010
- There's like, fifty
different ways of saying this.

33:32.052 --> 33:34.179
- I told you,
it really doesn't matter

33:34.221 --> 33:36.139
if you get it exactly right
because--

33:37.891 --> 33:39.351
- what the hell!

33:42.103 --> 33:43.939
Oh my god, where the
hell did that come from?

33:43.980 --> 33:45.565
- Wait, wait, everyone wait.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.530
He's dead.
- No shit!

33:51.571 --> 33:53.323
He just fell out
of the fucking sky.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.533
- That's not a real person!

33:54.574 --> 33:56.326
People don't just
fall out of the sky.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.163
- That sounded like
a plane crash.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.540
- Oh my god.
No.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.791
- Where are you going?

34:02.832 --> 34:04.626
- To help!
There might be survivors!

34:04.668 --> 34:07.212
- She's hyperventilating.
Stay with her.

34:07.254 --> 34:08.630
Call 911!

34:08.672 --> 34:11.007
- Shh. Clam down, Chloe.
Just breathe, alright?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.050
Rose!

34:12.092 --> 34:13.717
Rose, I need your phone!

34:13.760 --> 34:15.219
Chloe, no don't
look at the body.

34:15.262 --> 34:16.304
You don't need to see this,
alright.

34:16.346 --> 34:18.389
Just don't look at the
dead guy, look at me.

34:18.473 --> 34:23.520
- <i>Malala-una-dolama

34:42.746 --> 34:46.126

34:46.167 --> 34:48.295
Help, I'm stuck.
- Okay, baby, hold on.

34:48.335 --> 34:50.213
Alright, hold on.
Hold on.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.389
Look, I have to get help,
okay?

34:59.431 --> 35:00.890
<i>_@wmm</i>

35:00.932 --> 35:03.018
- Austin, are you okay?

35:03.059 --> 35:04.102
- Yeah, I think so.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.146
My ribs hurt
and I think I broke a foot.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.939
How about you?

35:09.733 --> 35:11.651
Ooh.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.862
There.

35:16.531 --> 35:19.951
Yeah, okay, listen.
Just stay there, alright?

35:19.993 --> 35:21.119
Don't move yet.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.540
What happened?

35:25.582 --> 35:26.791
- We crashed.

35:26.833 --> 35:27.959
" How?!

35:28.001 --> 35:29.210
- I don't know!

35:29.252 --> 35:32.047
It sounded like
the engine exploded.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.798
- Are you alright?
Are you hurt?

35:33.840 --> 35:36.009
- No, no, no!
Don't! Don't!

35:43.850 --> 35:45.810
- You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.206
Kathleen.
Kathleen.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.958
Hey, wake up!

36:09.000 --> 36:10.585
- Are we there?

36:10.627 --> 36:12.087
- We were in a plane crash.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.546
- Oh, I hate that.

36:13.588 --> 36:16.299
- Wake up,
the plane crashed!

36:16.341 --> 36:19.344
<i>'</i> 9h my god!

36:20.512 --> 36:22.472

- Hey! Hey!

36:24.140 --> 36:26.559
We can't open the door

36:26.601 --> 36:28.645
from the outside!
- Open the door!

36:28.687 --> 36:31.523
- Hey, there's people out there.
Thank god!

36:31.564 --> 36:34.484
- Can you get it
from over there?

36:37.696 --> 36:39.155
- Help?

36:42.117 --> 36:44.327
- Hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

How many people are in here?

36:54.796 --> 36:56.381

36:56.423 --> 36:58.258
- Help.
I'm stuck.

36:58.299 --> 37:00.135
- Oh, shit.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.012
Okay, listen up!

37:03.054 --> 37:04.514
My name's Dillon.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.350
Your plane has crashed.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.519
Alright, I've got a boat
not far from here.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.687
We're gonna get you all help

37:10.729 --> 37:14.023
but first I need everyone
to get off the plane.

37:14.149 --> 37:14.983
Can you walk?

37:15.024 --> 37:16.860
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I think I can.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.320
- Alright, if you can walk
i need you to move.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.281
Alright, come on let's go!

37:21.448 --> 37:23.032

37:33.251 --> 37:35.170
Oh! Oh, god!

37:39.424 --> 37:42.343
- Is that person...?
- Don't, don't, don't look. It's bad.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.512
- Shit.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.347
Hey!

37:46.389 --> 37:49.100
You're that guy!
- Not, not now.

37:54.939 --> 37:58.151
- Guys, I think the water's
getting higher.

37:58.193 --> 37:59.277
- Give me a hand.

38:02.739 --> 38:03.823
- Jesus.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.909
Alright, it's stuck,

38:07.869 --> 38:09.287
What's your name?

38:09.329 --> 38:10.705

38:10.747 --> 38:11.748
- Alright, Casey.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.335
Listen, I just need you to hang
tight for a little bit, okay.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.504
I've got a boat,
it's got tools on it.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.047
I'm gonna cut you free.
- No.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.882
No, please don't
leave me here.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.259
Please don't leave me here.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.845
Where's Austin?
Austin!

38:25.887 --> 38:26.679
Austin!

38:26.721 --> 38:28.848
- Casey, Casey, Casey.

38:28.890 --> 38:32.644
I don't know how
to tell you this but

38:32.685 --> 38:34.604
Austin's dead.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.690
- Dude, I'm right here.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.944
- Austin's alive.
He's alright!

38:43.530 --> 38:45.573
I thought those legs, you know...
- Austin!

38:45.615 --> 38:47.200
- Okay, stay with him,
we're gonna go on his boat.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.868
- Okay, you're Austin.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.120
- Yeah, I'm alive.

38:56.376 --> 38:57.210
Fuck.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.253
- What?
Fuck what?

38:58.294 --> 39:00.088
- Nothing, nothing.
You're okay.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.714
- I don't wanna drown.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.174
Please, baby,
i don't wanna drown.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.425
- No, you're gonna be okay.
I promise.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.511
We're gonna get you off this
plane in a couple of minutes

39:06.553 --> 39:08.596
and we're all gonna be okay.

39:08.638 --> 39:09.764
- Promise me.

39:09.806 --> 39:11.140
Promise me
I'm not gonna drown.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.768
- Listen, I'm not
gonna let you drown.

39:13.810 --> 39:16.688
- It's super important for
my life that I don't drown.

39:16.729 --> 39:19.357
- I promise.
We're gonna be okay.

39:19.399 --> 39:20.692
- We have to make it.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.069
- You and I will.

39:23.653 --> 39:25.655
- Me and you...

39:27.991 --> 39:30.159
Me and little you.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.791
I told you to pull out,
you asshole.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.340
- Somethings wrong.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.301
Why aren't they back yet?

39:46.342 --> 39:48.928
- They probably just
found some survivors

39:48.970 --> 39:50.763
and they're just helping them.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.266
- We should be helping.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.477
- Are you okay?
Can you breathe?

39:57.228 --> 39:59.731
- Yeah, I think I can.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.235
I don't wanna be here.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.945
- Come on.
Let's see if we can go help.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.614
- Okay-

40:12.911 --> 40:18.041
- <i>"ree coola-ey-yoo-neesus-
favalla. "</i>

40:18.082 --> 40:20.919
<i>And that is the correct
way to say the curse</i>

40:20.960 --> 40:23.296
<i>that created Victor crowley...</i>

40:38.728 --> 40:40.021
- Listen up.

40:40.063 --> 40:42.023
That woman, Casey, inside.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.942
She's trapped underneath
the chair rails,

40:43.983 --> 40:45.318
the water level's
rising pretty quick

40:45.360 --> 40:47.487
so we're going to head
over to my boat,

40:47.528 --> 40:49.197
I think I have some tools.

40:49.238 --> 40:50.657
- What are the chances
of you guys being out here

40:50.698 --> 40:51.783
in the middle of the nowhere?

40:51.824 --> 40:53.701
I guess tonight's
your lucky night.

40:54.077 --> 40:56.579
<i>- Daaaaddddyyy!</i>

40:59.207 --> 41:00.959
- Get back on the plane!

41:01.000 --> 41:02.460
Now!

41:03.169 --> 41:04.545
- Bullshit.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.547
Hey guys,
it's someone fucking with us.

41:06.589 --> 41:07.548
- Come on. Come on.
Come on.

41:07.590 --> 41:08.675
- Help!

41:08.716 --> 41:11.094
Hey!
We need help!

41:11.135 --> 41:13.346
We're over here!

41:13.388 --> 41:15.640
We're on the shoreline
about four hundred yards

41:15.682 --> 41:17.433
from the boat landing.

41:18.685 --> 41:20.687
- You are going
to stop yelling

41:20.728 --> 41:22.563
and get on that
fucking plane right now

41:22.605 --> 41:25.024
or I am going to kill you,
understand?

41:25.066 --> 41:27.944
- Jesus. You really are
a psychopath like they say.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.363
- Oh, you think I'm scary?

41:30.405 --> 41:32.407
That thing in the woods
is death itself

41:32.448 --> 41:33.908
and it's coming for all of us.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.077
Now get inside if you
want to live through this.

41:36.119 --> 41:37.912
- Understood.

41:47.422 --> 41:48.464
- Did you hear that?

41:48.506 --> 41:50.299
It sounded like
someone yelling.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.094
- We must be close.
The plane's gotta be this way.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.430
Come on.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.557
You good?
- Yeah.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.105
- Oh my god.

42:09.777 --> 42:12.739
What the hell?

42:15.491 --> 42:18.244
I guess this was his house.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.871
- It's part of the tour.

42:19.912 --> 42:21.664
- Huh?
- See.

42:24.125 --> 42:26.711
- They made this place
a memorial?

42:26.753 --> 42:29.589
What's next, a petting zoo
and a roller coaster?

42:29.630 --> 42:31.007
Jesus!

42:38.014 --> 42:39.849
It's a motion sensor.

42:42.018 --> 42:44.687
<i>- Daaaaddddyyy!</i>

42:44.729 --> 42:47.732
- Oh, come the fuck on.

42:47.774 --> 42:49.108
- Alex.

42:49.150 --> 42:52.028
- It's a...
It's a speaker.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.571
I bet they've got speakers
in all of these trees

42:53.613 --> 42:55.698
trying to scare the tourists.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.909
- Well it's working because
I'm about to shit my pants.

42:57.950 --> 42:58.701
- Shh.

42:58.743 --> 43:01.245
<i>- Daaaaddddyyy!</i>

43:01.287 --> 43:03.122
- Hide in here.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.628
- What the hell was that?

43:08.669 --> 43:09.879
- What was that?
- What was that?

43:09.921 --> 43:11.964
- Please,
please, it's too loud.

43:12.507 --> 43:14.300
- Hey, hey!
Stop it!

43:14.342 --> 43:16.344
- Guys, there's too much
weight, she's gonna drown!

43:16.385 --> 43:17.720
- Shh, quiet.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.263
- Guys, you have to get
off the plane right now

43:19.305 --> 43:20.431
or Casey's gonna drown.

43:20.473 --> 43:22.308
- No one gets out
of the plane.

43:22.350 --> 43:23.935
- Dude, did you hear
what the fuck I said?

43:23.976 --> 43:25.269
- Back the fuck off.

43:25.311 --> 43:27.146
- And he has a knife!

43:27.188 --> 43:28.773
- Fuck this.

43:28.815 --> 43:29.774
- You.

43:29.816 --> 43:31.901
You said this door couldn't
be opened from the outside?

43:31.943 --> 43:33.694
- I think so but I didn't
design the plane.

43:33.736 --> 43:35.154
- So then we're
safe in here, right?

43:35.196 --> 43:36.823
From whatever's
yellin' out there?

43:36.864 --> 43:41.160
- He's got,
he's got things, alright?

43:41.202 --> 43:42.328
A belt sander,

43:42.370 --> 43:45.289
he cut through a metal wall
in my ambulance boat.

43:46.666 --> 43:49.627
- Well, hopefully no one left
a belt sander out there

43:49.669 --> 43:52.171
for the past ten years, right?

43:56.259 --> 43:58.636
- Look at all this shit.

43:58.678 --> 44:00.763
- At least we found the light.

44:00.805 --> 44:03.516
- Ah, leave it to us
to find the only hiding place

44:03.558 --> 44:04.934
without a door.

44:08.688 --> 44:09.814
When we get outta
here I'm gonna--

44:15.403 --> 44:17.155
Alex, I can't breathe.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.157
- Baby, baby, I need
you to calm down, okay?

44:19.198 --> 44:20.658
There's nothing out there.

44:20.700 --> 44:21.951
Alright?

44:29.542 --> 44:30.835
- Look, see?

44:30.877 --> 44:32.587
See, I don't even think
it's a motion sensor.

44:32.628 --> 44:34.755
I think it's on a timer
or something.

44:36.465 --> 44:37.633
I mean, if we're
gonna hide in here

44:37.675 --> 44:39.135
we may as well turn off the--

44:40.720 --> 44:42.638
- run, Chloe!
Run, Chloe!

45:49.538 --> 45:50.957
- Is this even working?

45:50.998 --> 45:51.874
- I don't think so.

45:51.916 --> 45:52.750
- There's too much weight.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.210
We're just makin' it
sink faster.

45:54.252 --> 45:55.795
- So go back outside!

45:55.836 --> 45:57.588
- If we go out there
we all die.

45:57.630 --> 45:59.548
- God, enough with your
ghost bullshit, man.

45:59.590 --> 46:00.758
<i>'</i> Then

46:00.800 --> 46:02.218
see what happens!

46:02.260 --> 46:04.971
God, I'm trying to keep as
many of us alive as possible!

46:05.012 --> 46:07.723
- Oh, says the accused
mass murderer,

46:07.765 --> 46:09.475
holding the knife!

46:09.517 --> 46:11.018
- She makes a good point.

46:11.060 --> 46:12.061
- What?

46:12.103 --> 46:14.730
I've got complete strangers
who want to kill me everyday.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.565
You'd have something
for protection, too.

46:16.607 --> 46:17.817
- He makes a good point.

46:17.858 --> 46:20.403
- Chloe and Alex.
They're still at the boat.

46:20.444 --> 46:22.154
- Hey, if you can call them

46:22.196 --> 46:23.614
we can get them
to bring the boat around.

46:23.656 --> 46:24.407
- Yeah.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.284
- My phone's back there
with them.

46:26.325 --> 46:27.910
- Hold on.

46:27.952 --> 46:29.996
Nah, mine's on the boat
charging.

46:30.037 --> 46:31.163
<i>_@wmm</i>

46:31.205 --> 46:33.749
- alright, alright, who in here
still has a working phone?

46:33.791 --> 46:36.544
Kathleen, is mine
still on my seat?

46:36.585 --> 46:39.255
- No, I don't see it.
It must have fallen out.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.756
- Mine's in the water.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.758
- No one has a phone?!

46:42.800 --> 46:45.428
- Oh wait,
wait, wait, I have mine

46:45.469 --> 46:47.179
and it's okay.

46:47.305 --> 46:49.140
Oh, shit,
there's no service.

46:49.181 --> 46:51.684
- Hey, I got it.

46:51.726 --> 46:53.144
If I break this window

46:53.185 --> 46:55.229
and hold the phone out
just far enough,

46:55.271 --> 46:57.273
I may be able to get a signal.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.566
Stand back.

46:58.607 --> 46:59.984
- That's not...

47:00.026 --> 47:02.236
<i>~</i> ah!
Ow!

47:02.278 --> 47:03.279
- ...gonna work.

47:03.321 --> 47:04.780
- Yeah, thanks.

47:04.822 --> 47:07.450
- Fuckin' asshole,
that window's open right there.

47:11.162 --> 47:13.080
- Yeah, but the cell tower's
on this side.

47:13.122 --> 47:14.749
I know the area, okay?

47:14.790 --> 47:16.959
- Oh, my god.
I have to get outta here.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.252
Guys, I can't breathe.

47:18.294 --> 47:20.504
I can't take it
in here anymore.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.256
I gotta get outta here.

47:22.298 --> 47:23.674
I can't take it in anymore.
I gotta...

47:23.716 --> 47:25.009
- What about the radio
in the cockpit?

47:25.051 --> 47:26.302
- Nah, dude,
the cockpit's destroyed.

47:26.344 --> 47:27.553
There ain't nothin'
workin' in there.

47:27.595 --> 47:29.430
Trust me, dude,
you do not wanna go in there.

47:29.472 --> 47:30.598
Guys, listen!

47:30.639 --> 47:31.807
- What are you doing?

47:31.849 --> 47:33.726
- I'm looking for something
to break the window with.

47:33.768 --> 47:34.977
- Again with the
fucking window?

47:35.019 --> 47:37.355
- If the windows were breakable
there would be crazy people

47:37.396 --> 47:41.025
trying to smash them and
take down planes all the time.

47:41.067 --> 47:42.860
- Guys, I have to tell you
something about--

47:42.902 --> 47:44.111
- I can't take it
in here anymore.

47:44.153 --> 47:46.238
I have to get outta here.
I have to get out!

47:46.280 --> 47:47.323
- Kathleen!
Kathleen!

47:47.365 --> 47:48.407
Look at me!

47:48.449 --> 47:50.034
You can breathe just fine.
See.

47:50.076 --> 47:52.411
Just fine.

47:52.453 --> 47:54.497
" My pills.

47:54.538 --> 47:55.873
Where are my pills?

47:55.915 --> 47:57.333
- Everywhere!

47:58.125 --> 47:59.293
- Oh, wait.

47:59.335 --> 48:00.711
There's my bag!

48:01.587 --> 48:03.631
- Chloe!

48:03.672 --> 48:05.424
Go to the door!

48:07.259 --> 48:08.511
- Rose, let me in!

48:08.552 --> 48:11.263
- Chloe, go to the door!
Chloe!

48:11.305 --> 48:12.807
- I can't hear you!

48:17.103 --> 48:19.313
Oh my god!

48:23.567 --> 48:26.112
- Wait! Wait!
Turn around!

48:27.154 --> 48:28.030
Where-- where'd she go?

48:28.072 --> 48:30.032
Where-- where'd he go?

48:48.551 --> 48:50.052
- Damn!

48:50.553 --> 48:52.847
- Help... me...

48:54.014 --> 48:55.808
- Aaaarrgghh!

49:04.316 --> 49:06.110
- Austin, I can't hear anything!

49:06.152 --> 49:07.319
What's going on?

49:40.769 --> 49:42.730
- What the fuck was that?

49:42.771 --> 49:44.857
- I told you.
I told you he was real.

49:44.899 --> 49:46.609
He's gonna get all of us!

49:49.987 --> 49:52.406
- Hey, hey, hey.
Ls she okay?

49:52.448 --> 49:54.408
- Yeah, yeah. She just
swallowed some water.

49:54.450 --> 49:56.452
But there's something I'm
trying to tell you guys. She's--

49:56.494 --> 49:58.078
- pregnant!

49:58.120 --> 50:00.080
That's what he's
trying to say.

50:00.789 --> 50:02.750
I'm fucking pregnant.

50:07.505 --> 50:08.923
Wow, really?

50:08.964 --> 50:11.467
Don't everybody
celebrate at once.

50:11.967 --> 50:14.595
No.
No gifts, you guys-

50:14.637 --> 50:16.263
no party-

50:16.305 --> 50:18.641
just get me out from
under these fucking seats!

50:18.682 --> 50:21.769
- I can't stay here!
I can't breathe!

50:21.810 --> 50:23.187
- Watch her.

50:24.438 --> 50:26.899
Hey, hey, hey... you.

50:26.941 --> 50:28.442
- Dillon.
- Dillon.

50:28.484 --> 50:29.527
How far's your boat?

50:29.568 --> 50:32.238
- I don't know. Like,
fifteen minutes, ten if we run.

50:32.279 --> 50:34.949
Hey, you're not suggesting
we go out there now?

50:34.990 --> 50:37.243
- Look,
I've been here before,

50:37.284 --> 50:38.494
pinned down on
an ambulance boat.

50:38.536 --> 50:40.120
He's gonna find
a way in here somehow.

50:40.162 --> 50:42.081
All this did is
buy us some time.

50:42.122 --> 50:45.209
Alright? And time...
Time just ran out.

50:45.251 --> 50:47.753
- But you survived, right?
You made it.

50:47.795 --> 50:50.881
- Because he was distracted
by something else!

50:50.923 --> 50:53.008
There was these voices
yelling off in the distance

50:53.050 --> 50:55.052
and then he just
took off after them.

50:55.094 --> 50:56.637
Next thing I know,
the national guard was just there

50:56.679 --> 50:59.098
with their helicopter
picking me up.

51:00.307 --> 51:03.185
I thought you single handedly
fought off Victor crowley

51:03.227 --> 51:05.271
and tried to save
as many as you could?

51:05.312 --> 51:08.065
At least that's what he
wrote in his bullshit book!

51:08.107 --> 51:09.275
- So you did read it!

51:11.151 --> 51:13.445
- The publisher
had my ghost writer

51:13.487 --> 51:14.780
embellish some parts,
alright?

51:16.198 --> 51:17.783
- Fucking Joe knetter...

51:17.825 --> 51:21.620
But the rest of it
is almost all true-ish.

51:21.662 --> 51:23.622
Look outside!
You still don't believe me?

51:23.664 --> 51:24.957
- Oh, I don't know
what's more humiliating

51:24.999 --> 51:26.000
about that fucking book.

51:26.041 --> 51:28.502
The fact that you described
our wedding night

51:28.544 --> 51:32.131
or that cheesy dedication
to me on the first page.

51:32.172 --> 51:35.092
Those were song lyrics.

51:35.134 --> 51:36.552
<i>- Good night moon</i>

51:36.594 --> 51:39.096
is a children's book,
not a song.

51:39.138 --> 51:40.639
And it didn't even
make any sense.

51:40.681 --> 51:42.975
"Good night kittens
and good night mittens,

51:43.017 --> 51:44.643
I miss you, Sabrina."

51:44.685 --> 51:46.353
What?!

51:46.729 --> 51:48.230
- Fix your wig.

51:48.272 --> 51:50.482
- Ahh!

51:50.524 --> 51:53.027
- Okay look.
We've got two options:

51:53.068 --> 51:55.738
Wait here to die and watch Casey
drown under our own weight...

51:55.779 --> 51:57.489
- Ah, no.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.992
- Or Dillon and i
make a run for his boat.

52:00.034 --> 52:02.161
We'll call for help,
come back with the boat,

52:02.202 --> 52:03.078
pick everyone up.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.122
You do have a radio
on your boat, right?

52:05.164 --> 52:06.665
- Yeah, but...

52:06.707 --> 52:08.709
- I'll do it. I'll do it.
Let me go.

52:08.751 --> 52:10.502
- What?
Austin, no!

52:10.544 --> 52:12.963
I'm fast, case.
I ran track in high school.

52:13.005 --> 52:14.340
- I hate to break it to you

52:14.381 --> 52:17.885
but high school was
a long time ago for you!

52:19.887 --> 52:21.847
- Alright, yeah, I put on
a few pounds. So what?

52:21.889 --> 52:23.390
- I've seen men
try and run out

52:23.432 --> 52:25.017
after they knocked up
their on set hookup

52:25.059 --> 52:26.685
but this is some
next level shit.

52:26.727 --> 52:28.729
- I'll pretend there's some
free donuts out there, alright.

52:28.771 --> 52:29.521
I can make it.

52:29.563 --> 52:31.440
- Austin, please!

52:31.482 --> 52:33.525
- I wanna save you, case.

52:33.567 --> 52:35.611
- Please, Austin,
just stay here.

52:35.653 --> 52:36.904
- Hey, Austin,

52:36.945 --> 52:38.697
you don't know where
the boat is buddy, alright.

52:38.739 --> 52:40.324
He does.

52:41.033 --> 52:42.493
- She's still breathing.

52:42.534 --> 52:44.703
Chloe, she's still alive!

52:55.673 --> 52:56.465
- It's a trap.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.050
- She's still alive.

52:58.092 --> 53:00.052
- He's using her as bait
to get us out of the plane.

53:00.094 --> 53:02.137
- We can't leave her
out there.

53:02.179 --> 53:04.640
- He wants us
to open the door.

53:05.432 --> 53:06.517
Stop!

53:06.558 --> 53:08.644
You're gonna get yourself
killed and all of us with you.

53:08.686 --> 53:10.938
- She's my best friend.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.856
- I'll do it.

53:12.898 --> 53:13.607
- What?

53:13.649 --> 53:15.234
- I'll go get her.

53:15.275 --> 53:16.819
Shit.

53:16.860 --> 53:17.986
- What are you doing?

53:18.028 --> 53:19.697
- Looking for something
to fight back with

53:19.738 --> 53:21.323
when hatchet face
shows up again.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.575
- No, I mean what are
you doing... I'll go.

53:23.617 --> 53:25.661
- I got this, okay?

53:25.703 --> 53:27.705
Just promise me one thing.

53:27.746 --> 53:29.415
- What?

53:30.457 --> 53:33.877
- When I get back,
i get a kiss.

53:33.919 --> 53:35.546
Just one kiss.

53:35.587 --> 53:37.339
In case we don't
live through this.

53:37.381 --> 53:39.466
- Are you fucking kidding?

53:39.508 --> 53:41.218
- No-

53:41.260 --> 53:45.639
hey, you are the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

53:45.681 --> 53:47.141
My heart's been pounding

53:47.182 --> 53:49.727
since the moment
i laid eyes on you.

53:50.602 --> 53:53.814
One kiss when we get back.

53:58.277 --> 54:00.112
- Save my best friend
and I'll fucking marry you

54:00.154 --> 54:02.281
when you get back.
How about that?

54:02.322 --> 54:04.700
- Fucking white guy hero night
up in this bitch.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.827
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

54:06.869 --> 54:09.621
And I don't care
that you have a dick.

54:14.251 --> 54:18.964
- I don't... have a dick.

54:19.006 --> 54:20.966
It's a thing from earlier.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.681
What was that?
- Huh?

54:27.723 --> 54:29.433
- Tell me that was you.

54:32.269 --> 54:33.771
Oh my god!

54:39.860 --> 54:42.571
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

54:42.905 --> 54:45.073
- Stop! Stop!
It's just a water snake,

54:45.115 --> 54:46.283
it's not gonna hurt anybody!

54:46.325 --> 54:48.452
- I can't die in here!

54:49.453 --> 54:50.829
- Hey, hey, hey!

54:55.167 --> 54:56.794
- Kathleen! No!

54:56.919 --> 54:58.378
- Hey!
What are you doing?!

55:02.424 --> 55:04.593
- Oh, shit!

55:17.689 --> 55:19.817
Oh my god!
Those are his brains!

55:21.527 --> 55:23.070
- Oh god.
What are you doing?

55:26.865 --> 55:29.159
- He's coming!
He's coming! Run!

55:29.827 --> 55:31.787
<i>- 911, what's your emergency?</i>

55:33.872 --> 55:35.582
<i>Ma'am, what is your location?</i>

55:38.168 --> 55:40.087
Fihud]

55:44.508 --> 55:46.385
- <i>Ma 'am, I'm afraid
you're breaking up.</i>

55:51.014 --> 55:52.891
- Ahh!

56:02.651 --> 56:03.986
- Ew.

56:09.658 --> 56:11.326
What's going on?

56:12.369 --> 56:13.829
Austin!

56:15.789 --> 56:17.499
Oh, thank god.

56:17.541 --> 56:19.835
Please don't leave me.

56:19.877 --> 56:21.712
I don't wanna drown!

56:21.753 --> 56:24.590
Please, Austin.

56:24.631 --> 56:29.094
Austin, please
don't let me drown.

56:29.136 --> 56:31.513
Don't leave me.

56:40.981 --> 56:42.482
- You bastard!

56:44.735 --> 56:46.194
No!

56:54.161 --> 56:56.163
- Everybody hold on!
- What?

56:56.204 --> 56:57.915
- Everybody hold on!

57:01.084 --> 57:02.836
Fuck you!

57:12.971 --> 57:14.056
- He's on the roof!

57:14.097 --> 57:16.099
He's on the roof!
We're sinking!

57:16.141 --> 57:17.851
- Ahh!

57:19.770 --> 57:21.521
Ahh!

57:22.773 --> 57:24.107
No!

57:26.151 --> 57:27.653
No!

57:47.381 --> 57:49.007
No!

58:01.561 --> 58:03.230
'Zzz

58:06.483 --> 58:07.651
I tried.

58:09.277 --> 58:11.279
- It's bullshit.

58:11.321 --> 58:12.781
I survived this thing
ten years ago

58:12.823 --> 58:15.575
and I'm right back here again.

58:15.617 --> 58:17.077
Only this time,
I'm not gettin' out.

58:17.119 --> 58:19.788
This is fucking bullshit.

58:23.125 --> 58:25.794
- Why did you
come back anyway?

58:28.505 --> 58:33.552
- Because even I'm too stupid
to say no to a million bucks.

58:34.970 --> 58:37.305
- I'm sorry.
What?

58:38.181 --> 58:39.933
A million dollars for what?

58:39.975 --> 58:41.226
Not for this?

58:41.268 --> 58:42.769
- Yes, for this.

58:42.811 --> 58:44.604
Kathleen said
i as getting a mil.

58:45.522 --> 58:47.899
- Ohh.

58:50.068 --> 58:51.695
Oh, I hate to break it
to you, buddy,

58:51.737 --> 58:53.280
but there was no way in hell

58:53.321 --> 58:55.282
you were getting
a million dollars.

58:55.824 --> 58:57.367
- That was the deal.

58:57.409 --> 59:01.246
- Oh, you dumb,
stupid man.

59:01.288 --> 59:03.832
Maybe that's what your walking
pharmacist of a publicist

59:03.874 --> 59:05.792
told you before she
straight up fisted herself

59:05.834 --> 59:07.961
but you were getting
twenty five grand

59:08.003 --> 59:10.338
and that's before taxes
and commissions.

59:10.380 --> 59:11.131
- Wait. What?

59:11.173 --> 59:14.426
- We have interviewed
holocaust survivors.

59:14.468 --> 59:16.011
We have spoken
with firefighters

59:16.053 --> 59:17.637
that were inside the
world trade center

59:17.679 --> 59:20.432
on September 11th
and you think that you,

59:20.474 --> 59:23.602
Andrew yong,
a fucking nobody,

59:23.643 --> 59:26.271
self-important piece of shit,
are worth a million dollars

59:26.313 --> 59:28.607
just for telling
the same damn story

59:28.648 --> 59:30.025
you've been tryin'
to cash in on for what,

59:30.067 --> 59:31.068
a decade now?

59:32.319 --> 59:34.154
You're not a hero.

59:34.196 --> 59:37.491
You're just a pathetic little
man who turned a profit

59:37.532 --> 59:40.619
on other people's deaths.

59:40.660 --> 59:42.954
Oh, oh, wait.
Oh, I'm sorry.

59:42.996 --> 59:44.206
I'm sorry.

59:44.247 --> 59:48.293
I forgot to mention failed,
wanna be musician.

59:48.335 --> 59:50.295
Isn't that right, Andrew?

59:50.337 --> 59:52.130
Oh, oh, holdup.

59:52.172 --> 59:54.841
Y'all never heard of
the band haddonfield?

59:54.883 --> 59:57.052
Glam metal sucked
in the eighties

59:57.094 --> 59:59.971
and it sucks now, Andrew.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.723
And after tonight,

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:04.059
you'll still be nothing
more than a number

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.561
in a news story's body count.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.647
No one will even
care about you

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:14.528
or ever love you,
Andrew fucking yong.

01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:19.074
- Ex-wife.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:23.495
- It must be really hard
to be a talk show host.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.957
To build a career
out of talking to people

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:30.460
who actually have interesting
experiences to share.

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:32.462
To know that in just
a year or two,

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:36.383
a younger, prettier version of
you's going to take your spot.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:38.552
To have no skill
other than being pretty

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:40.971
and being able to read words
that other people wrote

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.973
off of a teleprompter.

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:45.142
Congrats on your
amazing achievement

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:46.560
of being born pretty.

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:49.729
- I will have you know--
- eat my asshole,

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:51.314
discount Oprah.

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:53.441
I'd look under my seat
to see what wonderful gift

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.235
your producers left
there for all of us

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:58.989
but I think I've seen enough
dead bodies for tonight.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.491
- Yeah.

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:05.328
Thank you.
- No, fuck you, too.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.038
The only worthwhile thing
you've ever done

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.415
is when you signed
that guy's cock

01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:10.625
at the bookstore
earlier today.

01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:14.045
- Ah, I didn't sign it.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:19.009
- You've made a living
cashing in on people's death.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.137
You're just a raging
sloppy garlic cunt.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:24.764
And I'm here because
i was helping my friend

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:27.851
make a b-slasher movie
about a real life tragedy

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:29.853
where real people
got massacred

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:33.231
so I'm no better
than any of you.

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.942
Maybe we're all getting
what we deserve.

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:39.154
- I, I, I didn't do
anything bad.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.739
- Shut up, Dillon!

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:42.699
- Quiet. Listen.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:45.869
- What?

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:47.037
- Is he gone?

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.705
- Shh.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.751
Hey, hey, come here?

01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:55.378
You work these tours, right?

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.214
- Obviously.

01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:59.591
<i>'</i> Whv tonight?

01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:01.509
The swamp has gone
a decade with incident

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.221
and it's become this theme park
for all things crowley.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:06.056
So why's this all
happening again tonight?

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:08.016
- I blame you.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.310
- I don't know.

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:13.772
Maybe he, you know, the ghost
comes back every ten years...

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:17.525
Like the loch ness monster,
or like slender man.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.654
Or, honestly I'm just
making this fucking shit up,

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:21.905
I don't know!

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:23.573
- We did this.

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.283
My friends and I.

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.410
- Hey, no, don't say that.

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:29.537
- Chloe wanted to film me
saying the voodoo curse

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.998
that brought Victor crowley
back way back when...

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.875
We couldn't figure out
how to say it

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.670
so I pulled up all these
videos on YouTube

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:39.005
that had all these losers
in their mom's basements

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:39.798
saying the curse.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:41.549
Maybe that's what
brought him back. I--

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:45.345
- maybe YouTube brought Victor
crowley back from the dead.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:48.056
Do you even hear yourself?

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:51.393
- I had a YouTube channel.

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:55.480
If anybody's interested.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.941
It's called
"chillin' with Dillon".

01:02:57.983 --> 01:02:59.651
I've got 86 subscribers.

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:03.029
Well, 85 now.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:10.787
Hey, what if Victor crowley
comes back every ten years?

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.081
- We played the curse.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.582
Like, a ton of times.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:17.085
Here in the swamp.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.588
Do you have a better idea
what brought him back?

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.341
- Maybe he comes back
every ten years.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:26.594
- A different better idea.

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:29.264
I kissed you.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:30.640
- It was awesome.

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.309
- Okay, whatever the case,

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.728
he's out there
and we're in here.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:36.688
He only haunts the swamp
at night, right?

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.606
- Yeah, I mean,
that's the legend.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.984
- So, we wait it out in here.

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:43.653
The sun comes up
and we walk right outta here.

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:44.321
Done.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:46.781
- No. The sun is still
a long time away.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:49.659
- I am sure people
are looking for me by now.

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:52.287
In fact if--
Jesus!

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:01.004
What... well, don't touch it!

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:03.006
- Her phone might still work.

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:04.257
- Are you kidding?

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:07.302
It has been inside...
It has been inside--

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:10.555
oh, that is fucking sick.

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:12.515
- I can't get it loose.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:20.607
It still works!

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:29.824
Guys!

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.159
- Well, what the fuck
are you waiting for?

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.994
Call for help!

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.120
- Anyone know her password?

01:04:34.162 --> 01:04:37.499
- God!
It was just ringing.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.042
Whoever called is probably
going to call again.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:41.127
You don't need a password
to answer a phone, alright.

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:43.171
So the next time it rings,
just answer it.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.131
- Hey, hey, are we positive
that no one else

01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:46.508
has a working phone in here?

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.344
- Ah, sure, just be a love
and reach under the seat here

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:51.137
and dig mine out of
the two feet of mud

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:53.473
and water
it's been soaking in.

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:00.897
- Which one?
This one?

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.621
- Motherfucker!

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.498
Dillon!
- Yeah!

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.834
- Lead the way to your boat.
We're gettin' out of here.

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:22.836
- Wait, wait, wait.
Don't we need a plan?

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:24.712
Like, what is the plan?

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:25.964
" Run!

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:28.007
- Hey! Wait!
What's he got now?

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:40.019
- Fuck!

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:41.855
What did I tell you?!

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:42.689
- They did.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.775
Somebody actually left a belt
sander out here for ten years!

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:09.716
- What the hell's that?

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:10.925
- Hold on!

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.302
This thing still has power.

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:13.803
- So what.
Even if we still have power

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:15.889
are we just going to just
take off an fly outta here?

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.223
- Of course not.

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:20.727
But think about it...
If there's power...

01:06:21.769 --> 01:06:22.729
- What?!

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:25.023
If there's still power what?!
Use words!

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:26.691
- The engine outside.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:29.402
If we can fire it up we'll have
something to fight back with!

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:30.028
Huh?!

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:31.946
Did you ever see a bird
go through a jet engine?

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.531
Poof!
Incinerated!

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:35.366
- So we push him in the engine?

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:37.702
- If we can get it started,
yeah!

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:39.370
- It could work!

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.622
- Of all the motherfuckers
i coulda been

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.081
in a plane crash with...
Fuck me!

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:43.541
- How do we turn it on?!

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.335
- Leave that to me.

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:52.967
- Pull!

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.969
- I got this.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.972
- We are so dead.

01:07:01.226 --> 01:07:02.977
- Ah.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.312
Ah...

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:07.106
I can do this.

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:16.282
Fuck it.

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:21.162
Come on!

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:22.956
Ah!

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.457
No!

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:25.667
- <i>Dillon!</i>

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.794
We're running out
of time in here!

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:31.923

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:33.883
Keep that door locked
and stay quiet!

01:07:33.925 --> 01:07:35.593
- <i>Then what?</i>

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:37.887
We're going swimming.

01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:43.434
- Just turn on,
you slutty whore!

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.940
Ha! Ha!

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:49.983
Yes!

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:53.278
That's what I'm talkin' about!
Dillon time!

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:59.867
Oh, why?
Why?

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.470
- Which way's the boat?

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:22.640
- What about Dillon?

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:23.975
- What?

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:25.852
- We can't leave him.

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:29.731
- Go. Hide.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:30.273
- No-

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.399
- I'll distract him, okay?
Just go!

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.484
- I'm not leaving him.

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:40.658
- Come on.

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:45.121
- Hey!
Remember...

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:48.666
--Me?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.725
- Hey!
I got the engine going!

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:09.854
Guys?

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:17.612
- Oh my god.

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.533
- Did you hear that?

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:24.118
Dillon got the engine on.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.953
- Give me that phone.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.122
The phone.
Give it to me.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:29.749
- We can't use it.
- Give it to me!

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:30.875
- Hey, what are you doing?!

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.042
Stop!

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.679
- Mayday.
Can anyone hear me?

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:08.264
My name is Dillon...

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:12.602

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:15.062

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:20.193
Passengers are dead

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:24.113
and ah, we're being attacked
by Victor crowley.

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:25.573
This is not a joke.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.533
Alright, I'm serious.
Can anyone hear me?

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:29.118
We need help.

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:35.625
Mayday, this is
general Dillon mcmaster.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:39.295
We've crashed in the honey
island swamp and need help.

01:11:39.337 --> 01:11:42.465
This is a consulate ship
on a diplomatic mission.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:56.312
- Oh, oh the boat.
The boat.

01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:58.940

general commandant

01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:19.043

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:22.046
My plane has crashed
in honey island swamp.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:25.967
Many casualties and I'm
under siege by Victor crowley.

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.844
Anyone out there

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:29.762

<i>- Open the fucking door!</i>

01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:39.063

You came back.

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:43.484
- Of course I came back.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.152
Well, look,

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.821
and I've been calling
for help so...

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:47.530
- I dropped my knife.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:49.323
Is there something in here
we can fight back with,

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:50.658
like a gun or...?

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.743
- Urn... shit.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:54.871
Oh... just a flare gun.

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.497
- Oh.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.625
- Hey, hey.
We're almost out of fuel

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:02.044
so if we're gonna make a move,
we gotta make it now.

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:03.462
- Okay, let's go.

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:04.755
I didn't mean now.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:07.300
Where's rose and that
terrible woman you married?

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.973
- Hopefully they
made it to the boat!

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:15.516
I didn't see.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.560
- Whose boat?
My boat?

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:21.480
- No, my boat.
Yes, your boat!

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:23.316
- They're not gonna
get very far.

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:27.528
- Keys, keys, keys, keys.
Where are they?

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.416
- Hey! Look!

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.960
It's rose!

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.421
- He's... coming!

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.298
- Don't turn around!
Just run!

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.883
Just run!

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:40.768
- Come on!
Shit!

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:42.061
Come on!
- He's coming!

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:43.938
- Come on!
- Run!

01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:50.194
- Nice shot.

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:53.030
- Yeah, well, I was
aiming for his balls so...

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:56.450
- Ahh!

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:01.789
- Come on, come on, come on!
Get up here!

01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:07.920
- Wait!

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:09.922
I've got this.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:14.927
Though she be but little,
she is fierce.

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.142
'K, shoot him, yong!

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:25.062
Go to hell,
you ugly bastard!

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.944
- Maybe, uh,
no more one-liners?

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.990
- Ahh!

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.247
Fuck my life.

01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:59.096
- I would of had your babies.

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:01.182
Ahh!

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:02.725
- No!

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:08.689
- No!

01:16:09.607 --> 01:16:11.609
No!

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:26.665
- Fuc--

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:01.784
- <i>we interrupt this program
with</i> a <i>nreaking news report.</i>

Tragedy has once again
hit New Orleans

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:06.956
as at least seven have been
killed in a plane crash.

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:09.500
A private plane that went
missing early last night,

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.752

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:13.379

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:15.131

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:18.467
We're told that so far only
two survivors have been located.

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:21.220
However, search and rescue
teams are still on the scene

01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:22.388
as we speak.

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:25.432
Authorities say that the
aircraft was chartered by--

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:26.517
uh, hold on.

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:29.145
I understand that we have
an eye witness on the phone.

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:30.437
Hello, sir?

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.314
Are you part of
the recovery team?

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:34.525
<i>- Yes, ma'am, I'm here.</i>

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:37.736
- Ls there any information as
to the cause of the crash?

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:41.740
- <i>Well, it looks like there's
some kinda fire or explosion.</i>

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:44.869
<i>I mean, we're finding bodies
everywhere though.</i>

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:47.538
<i>I mean, even where we are
now deep in these woods</i>

<i>turnin' up everywhere.</i>

01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:55.129
- Ls it possible that victims
were thrown that far

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:56.213
from the crash?

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:57.965
<i>- Well, that's just the--</i>

01:17:58.007 --> 01:17:59.675
<i>I mean, there's just
no conceivable way</i>

<i>that almost everyone on board
was thrown from the plane.</i>

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.431
<i>I mean, only three or four
bodies were found inside</i>

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:07.600
<i>the plane and the rest are,

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:14.190

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:15.316
Sony?

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:19.195
That one of them appears
to be Andrew yong?

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:22.865
Yes, we have confirmation that
one of the two survivors

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:24.742
is indeed Andrew yong,

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:28.287
the survivor of the 2007
honey island swamp massacre.

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:30.080
Sir, are you still on the line?

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:31.248
- Yes, ma'am.

<i>Ah, we just located another

<i>Oh lord, it's on the

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:50.351
