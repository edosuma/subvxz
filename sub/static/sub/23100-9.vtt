Wing tips. Check. Tail. Check. String.

01:34.875 --> 01:35.875
Check.

01:36.125 --> 01:41.375
Ah, Mr. Kite, you and your co-pilot
make a splendid team indeed.

01:45.208 --> 01:46.958
Wait. What?

01:47.125 --> 01:48.791
I'm on my own?

01:48.958 --> 01:52.083
Stay calm, Mr. Kite, stay calm.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.833
Oh, I think I have the measure
of this boisterous updraft.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.875
No!

02:20.916 --> 02:23.625
That hurt... quite a bit.

02:23.791 --> 02:26.333
Severe bleeding. Check.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.333
Pain. Check.

02:28.500 --> 02:33.333
Surely someone must have witnessed
Mr. Kite's crash landing.

02:33.750 --> 02:37.833
Just stay calm... till help arrives.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.166
Help.

02:41.916 --> 02:47.208
I spy with my compound eye
something beginning with "S."

02:47.375 --> 02:48.708
-Science.
-Stars.

02:48.875 --> 02:50.541
Awesome!

02:51.458 --> 02:53.041
Sawesome?

02:53.208 --> 02:54.916
- Strawberries.
- Oh.

02:55.083 --> 02:56.458
My turn. My turn.

02:56.625 --> 03:03.125
I spy with my compound eye
something beginning with...

03:03.291 --> 03:04.291
rock.

03:05.583 --> 03:07.000
Rock?

03:07.625 --> 03:09.791
You always guess.

03:13.125 --> 03:16.916
Who-- Who are you?
What are you doing to me?

03:17.083 --> 03:20.125
Can't you see I'm hurt?

03:21.583 --> 03:23.708
Relax. We're helping you.

03:23.875 --> 03:28.625
Oh, you are such brave
and kind souls, all.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.791
Alas, you are too late.

03:30.958 --> 03:35.208
Mr. Kite has lost too much blood.

03:35.375 --> 03:37.833
It's just strawberry.

03:37.916 --> 03:39.416
Yum! Strawberry.

03:41.333 --> 03:45.500
I... I'm starting to feel much better now.

03:45.666 --> 03:49.125
Mr. Kite may pull through after all.

03:49.291 --> 03:51.875
How did you end up
in the forest, Mr. Kite?

03:52.041 --> 03:54.791
You don't want to hear
all the boring details.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Hm.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.583
But since you insist, let me tell you

03:58.666 --> 04:02.208
about my exploits
as a daring aerial adventurer.

04:08.166 --> 04:11.375
I was once the envy
of all the kites at the air show.

04:11.541 --> 04:13.875
I flew over the desert...

04:13.958 --> 04:16.166
across the seas...

04:16.250 --> 04:19.666
climbed to heights
no other kite dared to go.

04:20.541 --> 04:22.416
Until now.

04:23.416 --> 04:27.583
-We have to get you back up there.
-I admire your spirit.

04:27.750 --> 04:31.833
But if Mr. Kite has learned anything
in these dark testing times,

04:31.916 --> 04:35.333
it's that he is nothing
without his co-pilot.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.791
Where's your co-pilot?

04:38.833 --> 04:39.916
Whoa.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.666
The big house?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.208
Then we'll get you there!

04:45.291 --> 04:48.125
But... I'm in no condition to fly.

04:50.416 --> 04:51.416
Ugh.

04:51.833 --> 04:52.666
Ow!

04:52.750 --> 04:54.833
I think I've found the problem.

04:54.916 --> 04:59.208
And I have just what we need
to crick-tify it.

05:00.416 --> 05:01.708
Ow!

05:01.791 --> 05:06.666
Oh, the pain. The pain.
It's too much for Mr. Kite to bear.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.875
But-- But I haven't started yet.

05:08.958 --> 05:11.416
Oh, well, carry on then.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.375
Wait, I-- I'm sweating.

05:15.541 --> 05:17.541
Oh, it's so hot in here.

05:17.958 --> 05:21.250
Aah. Thank you. Much better.

05:21.958 --> 05:24.125
I'm ready, Dr. Crick.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.458
Wingtips. Check.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.750
Tail. Oh, check.

05:35.916 --> 05:38.166
-Fabric. Check.
-Awesome!

05:38.333 --> 05:41.083
Mr. Kite's ready to fly.

05:41.166 --> 05:44.625
Oh, yes, way up in the sky. All alone.

05:44.708 --> 05:47.208
Nothing I'd like more.

05:47.291 --> 05:50.750
What's wrong?
Don't you want to get back up in the air?

05:51.333 --> 05:53.791
I do, but after my accident,

05:53.958 --> 05:57.666
I'll need something special
to make that leap again.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.833
What do you mean "special"? Like what?

06:01.708 --> 06:08.041
Special like an all-singing,
all-dancing festival of flying feats?

06:08.208 --> 06:10.541
Would that be special enough?

06:10.625 --> 06:13.958
Well, I must admit,
as an old air-show star,

06:14.125 --> 06:16.833
I do respond well to an audience.

06:16.916 --> 06:20.000
Then, let the show begin.

06:22.791 --> 06:25.166

09:00.208 --> 09:05.166
Wait! Please. Don't go! Ahh.

09:11.875 --> 09:14.833
Oh, I failed you all.

09:15.666 --> 09:19.041
We have to do something, anything.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.708
Or the whole show's over.

09:21.958 --> 09:26.500
Can't breathe. I need air.
Someone give me some air.

09:28.333 --> 09:33.541
So, this is it then,
Mr. Kite's illustrious career over.

09:33.625 --> 09:34.958
All over.

09:35.125 --> 09:38.500
I should have known
I was never made for flying solo.

09:38.583 --> 09:41.916
Don't give up yet, Mr. Kite.
There must be something.

09:44.500 --> 09:48.291
Oh! That's it.
We were missing one ingredient.

09:48.375 --> 09:51.625
-What kind of ingredient?
-An essential ingredient.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.375
A neshenshel ingrebient!

09:53.541 --> 09:57.416
Of course. Wind.
That's what we need.

09:57.583 --> 10:03.750
-So, can we make this go faster?
-Well, uh, it's not impossible.

10:18.333 --> 10:21.666
Don't stop now! He's ready to fly!

10:24.958 --> 10:26.833
-Aah!
-Whoa!

10:48.500 --> 10:50.916
Pull up, Mr. Kite. Pull up!

10:51.000 --> 10:55.333
-But Mr. Kite has never flown solo before.
-You're doing it now.

10:55.833 --> 10:57.291
I am?

10:57.750 --> 10:59.458
I am.

10:59.666 --> 11:01.666
I'm flying solo.

11:02.208 --> 11:05.958
I am flying solo.

11:20.958 --> 11:23.083
Mr. Kite!

11:23.250 --> 11:25.000
I'm coming to get you.

11:25.083 --> 11:26.875
Oh! My kite.

11:28.583 --> 11:31.208
I thought you were lost forever.

11:37.791 --> 11:40.375
Is there, uh... any sign of them yet?

11:44.375 --> 11:47.875
-I spy with my compound eye...
-Jay!

11:48.041 --> 11:50.458
...something starting with B.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.416
-Big house?
-Big house?

11:52.500 --> 11:54.041
Right first time.

11:54.125 --> 11:57.708
-What about Mr. Kite? Did he make it?
-Did he? Did he?

12:08.333 --> 12:12.416
Thank you. Thank you all, for everything.

12:38.541 --> 12:43.375
Load the crick-tapult with petals.
Oh, my belly-ness this is so exciting!

12:43.583 --> 12:47.125
Uh, Walter?
By my crick-to-calculations,

12:47.208 --> 12:50.708
it'd be safer with, um... half this many.

12:50.791 --> 12:52.750
But this is for Kumi's birthday.

12:52.833 --> 12:57.250
Imagine the look on her face
when these petals explode.

12:57.416 --> 13:02.583
Suddenly her favorite color
fills her universe.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.208
So, I won't have a petal less.

13:11.708 --> 13:15.333
Awesome! What are they?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.541
They're the prizes for the games.

13:17.625 --> 13:21.333
And I'm gonna make sure
that Kumi wins them all.

13:21.500 --> 13:25.041
I love this game! Can I practice?

13:25.125 --> 13:26.833
Okay, uh, close your eyes.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.500
Petals. Perfect.

13:39.666 --> 13:41.875
Games. Wonderful.

13:42.041 --> 13:45.791
Berry cakes. So delicious.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.958
Buzz! No!

14:00.791 --> 14:03.958
Uh, Kumi, I need you here now.

14:11.750 --> 14:12.791
Oh.

14:13.541 --> 14:14.625
What a surprise.

14:15.833 --> 14:21.333
I hereby declare this birthday party
officially open.

14:21.500 --> 14:25.291
First game, hide and seek.

14:25.958 --> 14:28.666
Here's good. No, no, here.

14:31.166 --> 14:34.000
-I can find my own hiding place, Walter.
-No, no.

14:34.166 --> 14:37.333
You need to have the perfect hiding spot.

14:37.416 --> 14:38.708
Here.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.583
Ready or not, here I come.

14:50.125 --> 14:51.125
Walter?

14:52.041 --> 14:56.208
-You're out.
-Huh? Me? How did you see me?

14:56.958 --> 15:00.541
Not that way. No one over there. No one.

15:00.708 --> 15:01.916
Look over here.

15:02.083 --> 15:03.791
Or over here. Or here.

15:03.958 --> 15:05.625
Kumi, you're out.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.333
Next game. Pyramids.

15:12.625 --> 15:13.708
Aah. Woo-hoo!

15:13.791 --> 15:14.875
I won!

15:15.666 --> 15:17.666
Walter. Stop pushing.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.541
-Jay's won!
-No, he can't.

15:20.708 --> 15:25.000
It's your special day. You have to win.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.375
Whoa!

15:28.875 --> 15:30.791
-Ouchie.
-Ow.

15:30.875 --> 15:33.083
The ouchiest.

15:33.250 --> 15:37.000
Don't worry, you'll win the next game,
cross my squish.

15:37.083 --> 15:40.750
-Walter, I really don't need you to--
-The Three-Legged Race!

15:40.916 --> 15:41.875
Unh.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.250
Faster, Kumi, faster.

15:45.416 --> 15:50.291
You're going to win
even if I have to throw you over that line

15:50.375 --> 15:52.708
with my very last breath.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.666
Ugh. Ow!

15:57.083 --> 15:58.291
Oopsie.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.833
Prickles! Ow.

16:00.416 --> 16:01.250
Walter?

16:02.541 --> 16:04.791
Could the next game be... Ow!

16:04.958 --> 16:07.208
-...a bit less dangerous?
-Yes.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.333
I have a dent in my head sticks.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.916
And my leg's kind of... uh, bent.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.125
And I hurties.

16:20.041 --> 16:24.375
So, you'd like to organize
your own little Kumi party, would you?

16:24.541 --> 16:26.958
-Oh, Walter, we didn't mean--
-Fine.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.291
I know when I'm not wanted.

16:29.458 --> 16:33.541
I'll just take my delicious berry cakes
and go home...

16:34.375 --> 16:35.750
The berry cakes?

16:36.500 --> 16:39.250
Stop!

16:40.833 --> 16:42.625
Oh, please don't go, Walter!

16:42.791 --> 16:44.250
-We just meant--
-It's too late!

16:44.333 --> 16:46.500
I know when I'm not wanted.

16:56.791 --> 16:58.875
I bet they're feeling sorry now.

16:59.041 --> 17:02.000
They won't be having any fun without me.

17:05.790 --> 17:09.208
Maybe if he sees us playing,
he'll come back?

17:10.915 --> 17:12.708
-Ha-ha-ha.
-Yeah! Ha-ha.

17:13.415 --> 17:15.375
They don't even miss me.

17:18.540 --> 17:25.083
All right. If that's how it is, then--
Then I'll just find other friends.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.958
What do we play now?

17:28.165 --> 17:31.291
If Walter was here,
he'd tell us a story.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.375
Or give us a group hug.

17:33.541 --> 17:38.416
By my crick-to-calculations,
four bugs are a group.

17:44.416 --> 17:47.833
A hug isn't a hug
without Walter's squish.

17:50.041 --> 17:52.125
You want me to go find him, right?

17:52.208 --> 17:53.916
-Yes!
-Yes! Uh-huh.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.666
Well, my new friends,

17:59.750 --> 18:04.000
this is the story of the Yellow Submarine.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.333
Kumi, Jay and-- Uh, oh.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.083
Never mind their names.

18:08.166 --> 18:11.708
We were on an adventure
to the Big House.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.083
We love your stories!

18:14.166 --> 18:16.708
Oh, that's so kind of you,
my new friends.

18:16.791 --> 18:21.333
- And thanks for the ice cream. It's...
- belly-licious.

18:21.416 --> 18:23.875
Ha-ha. Belly-licious!

18:24.041 --> 18:25.541
You're so-- Ahem.

18:25.625 --> 18:28.083
You're so funny, Walter.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.916
Keep going, Walter.

18:30.083 --> 18:33.875
Well, you wouldn't
believe what happened next.

18:34.833 --> 18:35.666
Huh.

18:35.750 --> 18:39.125
And his new friends gave him...
an ice cream?

18:39.333 --> 18:43.708
Mm-hm. We have to do something.
We have to bring him back.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.875
So, what--? Ahem.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.458
So, what happened next, Walter?

18:47.625 --> 18:49.375
Tell us, tell us!

18:50.708 --> 18:55.166
What am I doing?
Why am I talking to sticks?

18:55.416 --> 18:57.583
I want real friends.

18:57.750 --> 19:01.458
Real friends who can really talk back!

19:03.583 --> 19:05.625
I'll put on a play.

19:05.791 --> 19:06.833
Yes.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.083
The best play anyone has ever seen.

19:15.833 --> 19:17.541
It's getting dark.

19:17.625 --> 19:18.958
And scary.

19:19.125 --> 19:22.416
- And as the flood water rose...
- What's that noise?

19:22.500 --> 19:25.166
It's Walter, telling a story.

19:25.333 --> 19:28.500
Save us! Oh, my belly-ness.

19:28.583 --> 19:31.833
- Could that be a...
- submarine?

19:32.000 --> 19:35.750
And then Buzz said,
"What's a slub-ma-sheen?"

19:35.916 --> 19:40.125
And then Kumi said... Ugh.

19:40.208 --> 19:41.833
What's the use?

19:41.916 --> 19:45.583

To see your play!

20:54.000 --> 20:56.791
You did? All right.

20:56.958 --> 21:00.625
It's about our adventure
in the yellow submarine,

21:00.791 --> 21:03.750
and I'm at the part
where the water is rising.

21:03.916 --> 21:06.750
Oh, my belly-ness.

21:06.916 --> 21:09.625

And then Kumi says:

21:15.708 --> 21:18.375
It's like a boat that drives
under the ocean, Buzz.

21:18.541 --> 21:20.583
It's completely under the water.

21:20.666 --> 21:26.833
Ah. Except for the... bit that you can see
completely above the water. Heh.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.583
-And it's completely--
-Awesome!

21:29.666 --> 21:33.708
And then I say,
"It's our only way to get home."

21:34.958 --> 21:36.000
Hey, Walter?

21:36.166 --> 21:37.000

21:37.083 --> 21:40.375

my squish into that thing?"

I just like you all so much...

22:25.416 --> 22:28.291
and I'm scared you don't like me.

22:28.458 --> 22:30.750
Walter, we like you.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.458
-You do?
-Yeah.

22:32.625 --> 22:35.625
-Even if sometimes we argue.
-Only sometimes.

22:35.708 --> 22:40.291
And even the best friends argue...
sometimes.

22:40.458 --> 22:42.000
Which is why we're here.

22:42.166 --> 22:44.458
-To say... sorry.
-Sorry.

22:44.791 --> 22:47.208
Thanks.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.791
But-- But what about the party?

22:50.916 --> 22:53.875

-It didn't.
