02:43.965 --> 02:47.766
King Norm, Ruler of the North,
Titan of the Tundra,

02:47.768 --> 02:51.704
Potentate of the Pole,
the Sultan of Snow!

02:53.107 --> 02:54.574
That's all I got.

02:55.542 --> 02:56.844
Uh-huh.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.745
Wake up, you royal heinie!

02:59.747 --> 03:01.679
I need food!

03:01.681 --> 03:03.017
Have you thought about fishing?

03:03.550 --> 03:06.618
Fishing? Hello! I'm a caribou!

03:06.620 --> 03:08.553
I forage.
Lichens, sedges, shrubs.

03:10.557 --> 03:11.522
The good stuff. The green stuff.
Do you even care?

03:11.524 --> 03:15.029
Of course I caribou.
I mean I care about you.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.730
You look skinny, Mickey.
You been working out?

03:17.732 --> 03:20.801
Skin... What...

03:22.970 --> 03:24.138
Whoa, what got into him?

03:24.571 --> 03:25.873
Not food.

03:26.506 --> 03:29.176
Try paying a little
more attention, Norm.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.645
The crown never rests.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.415
Uh...

03:36.717 --> 03:38.886
It could be my family!

03:39.153 --> 03:41.552
Your family will have to wait
until you're done

03:41.554 --> 03:43.889
- with your kingly duties.
- Oh, when is that?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.690
After you've heard
the last complaint

03:45.692 --> 03:46.593
from your subjects.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.979
The snow is too soft!

04:05.512 --> 04:08.147
- Uh-huh.
- The salmon are not running!

04:08.149 --> 04:10.615
Uh-huh.

04:10.617 --> 04:14.088
And can I call you
Mr. Poopy Pants from now on?

04:15.622 --> 04:17.091
Uh-huh, definitely.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.927
What?

04:25.632 --> 04:26.865
Earthquake!

04:34.742 --> 04:37.610
Uh... hi?

04:38.713 --> 04:42.081
King Norm, I come before you
to ask your approval

04:42.083 --> 04:45.585
so I can partake in the
Jubilee festivities this year.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.961
- And you are...
- I'm Tiny.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.966
No, you're not.
You're huge!

04:59.233 --> 05:01.736
That's my name.
It's ironic.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.106
Really?

05:06.841 --> 05:08.240
I'm part of the North too,

05:08.242 --> 05:10.244
and I want to be part
of the Jubilee.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.278
Of course.
Uh, it makes sense, but...

05:13.280 --> 05:15.680
But, well,
how can I put this politely?

05:15.682 --> 05:17.051
It's just that you're a...

05:17.718 --> 05:19.985
I'm a?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.089
Well, you're a killer... whale.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.058
Everyone's kinda scared of you.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.591
Me?

05:26.593 --> 05:28.129
Who's scared of me?

05:32.266 --> 05:34.769
Hmm. It's my family!

05:54.955 --> 05:56.290
Ah.

05:58.993 --> 06:01.193
Where are you going?

06:01.195 --> 06:03.064
Um, family.

06:03.864 --> 06:07.232
What? Wait!
Your crown!

06:20.848 --> 06:22.349
Uh-oh.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.020
Oh, I hate Mondays.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.228
Game on, kids.

06:35.229 --> 06:39.867
Chase? Maria? Quinn? Yoo-hoo.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.972
Ha! Gotcha!

06:45.773 --> 06:46.673
Whoa!

06:50.044 --> 06:51.110
Huh?

06:53.781 --> 06:55.082
Ah-ha!

06:58.152 --> 07:00.321
I've got you now!

07:02.423 --> 07:06.093
No fair!

07:07.795 --> 07:09.296
Oh! Oh! Oh!

07:09.797 --> 07:11.966
I wonder who that might be.

07:27.848 --> 07:28.816
Whoa!

07:30.751 --> 07:33.053
Hey, hey! Whoa!

07:33.854 --> 07:36.724
Catch me if you can!

07:40.761 --> 07:41.896
Hmm.

08:00.381 --> 08:01.914
Whoa!

08:01.916 --> 08:03.450
Come to papa bear!

08:04.185 --> 08:05.186
That's cheating!

08:06.320 --> 08:08.120
You don't win until you catch
every last one of us!

08:23.837 --> 08:24.838
Gotcha!

08:27.975 --> 08:29.441
I win.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.443
He fell for it!

08:32.446 --> 08:33.447
Hmm?

08:36.116 --> 08:37.150
Get him, kids!

08:39.352 --> 08:41.355
Oh! Oh, it's on now!

08:41.922 --> 08:43.424
I mean business.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.326
Do you?

08:49.496 --> 08:52.366
Uh, it's not
what it looks like.

08:54.335 --> 08:56.802
No. It's worse!

08:56.804 --> 08:59.004
You're the King of the North,
Norm.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.305
The King!

09:00.307 --> 09:02.975
When you placed that crown
on your head,

09:02.977 --> 09:04.443
you took an oath.

09:04.445 --> 09:06.278
Your subjects need you!

09:06.280 --> 09:10.150
And instead,
you cavort and frolic?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.920
Let's go!

09:18.525 --> 09:19.927
Not again.

09:20.995 --> 09:24.031
- Come on, Dad. Please?
- Just five more minutes.

09:24.531 --> 09:27.599
Sorry, kids. Duty calls.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.935
I won't be too long this time.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.405
We've heard that before.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.240
I got a little
more work to do,

09:35.242 --> 09:37.175
but I promise,
when I get home tonight,

09:37.177 --> 09:40.047
we'll play a game
of Snow Blast, huh?

09:40.881 --> 09:45.317
Come on, what do you say?
You can't pass up Snow Blast!

09:45.319 --> 09:46.487
Huh?

09:46.887 --> 09:49.421
- You promise?
- I promise.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.525
When have I ever broken
a promise?

09:51.959 --> 09:54.461
Since you've been King,
all the time.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.030
Well, not anymore.
I decree it.

09:58.032 --> 10:00.032
Tonight we will have
the greatest game

10:00.034 --> 10:01.869
of Snow Blast in history!

10:04.938 --> 10:07.141
You're on!

10:07.341 --> 10:09.007
Be careful what you wish for,

10:09.009 --> 10:12.411
for I am Norm,
King of the Snow Blast!

10:14.882 --> 10:16.250
Oh, grow up.

10:40.507 --> 10:41.673
Hello, folks!

10:41.675 --> 10:44.176
This year's Jubilee
promises to be

10:44.178 --> 10:46.211
the biggest and best ever

10:46.213 --> 10:48.413
as the new
King of the North, Norm,

10:48.415 --> 10:51.550
takes his place
in the pantheon of the greats.

10:51.552 --> 10:52.984
Once again,

10:52.986 --> 10:54.588
you're right on point there,
Jim.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.990
Definitely in the panth-y...
Python...

11:00.527 --> 11:03.161
Whatever you just said there,
Jim.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.663
That's what it is.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.200
This all seems a bit much to me.

11:08.202 --> 11:12.639
Norm, this is the most important
duty you will perform!

11:13.307 --> 11:15.607
The King of the North
needs to place his crown

11:15.609 --> 11:17.376
on the apex of the tower

11:17.378 --> 11:20.145
at the precise moment
of the Jubilee,

11:20.147 --> 11:22.214
guaranteeing peace
and abundance

11:22.216 --> 11:23.548
for the coming winter.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.384
That's just silly superstition.

11:25.386 --> 11:27.254
Silly super...

11:27.454 --> 11:31.492
This is tradition,
the way of the North.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.929
It dates back thousands of years
to the North's first King,

11:36.230 --> 11:40.065
Ragmar the First,
Olaf the Pungent,

11:40.067 --> 11:41.902
even Herman the Meek,

11:42.269 --> 11:45.339
all fulfilled their kingly duty.

11:45.740 --> 11:48.607
This is our history.

11:48.609 --> 11:50.308
This is your duty,

11:50.310 --> 11:53.412
and we've got a lot
of preparations to get ready

11:53.414 --> 11:56.250
for the Jubilee
and not a lot of time.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.451
Oh, heavens to polar bear.

11:59.453 --> 12:03.188
I know, Socrates. I know.
There are things to be done.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.325
And, hey,
your list doesn't look so...

12:07.094 --> 12:08.228
bad.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.766
Now, I'll tell ya, Rick,
these are the very moments

12:13.768 --> 12:15.400
that define a king.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.103
Does Norm have what it takes
to protect the North?

12:18.105 --> 12:21.640
Will he be able to lead
his team to victory?

12:21.642 --> 12:24.211
Nope, probably not there, Jim.

12:24.611 --> 12:29.047
Norm needs to realize
that there's no "I" in "team."

12:29.049 --> 12:32.152
But there is one
in "hippopotamus."

12:35.022 --> 12:38.492
Right you are, Rick.
For once, right you are.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.227
That's for sure.

12:49.570 --> 12:52.573
Huh?

12:55.342 --> 12:58.078
Snow Blast it.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.490
- <i>You promise?</i>
- <i>I promise.</i>

13:11.492 --> 13:13.458
<i>When have I ever
broken a promise?</i>

13:13.460 --> 13:16.394
<i>Oh,
tonight's gonna be a blast!</i>

13:16.396 --> 13:17.797
<i>Tonight's gonna rule!</i>

13:17.799 --> 13:20.232
<i>Tonight,
I'm gonna crush all of you!</i>

13:27.441 --> 13:30.743
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm gonna make it up.

13:30.745 --> 13:32.679
Of course you will, dear.

13:34.414 --> 13:38.283
I remember that.
We had so much fun that spring.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.519
It was the best vacation ever.

13:40.521 --> 13:41.821
We should do it again!

13:41.823 --> 13:44.658
I mean,
after the festival, obviously.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.592
And then I have to tour
the West Floe,

13:47.594 --> 13:49.461
and oh, yeah, I got...
I gotta do something

13:49.463 --> 13:51.129
about that herring farm.

13:51.131 --> 13:55.302
We're never going on
a family vacation again, are we?

14:43.550 --> 14:45.885
<i>♪ I'm a little teapot ♪</i>

14:45.887 --> 14:48.420
<i>♪ Short and stout</i>

14:48.422 --> 14:51.156
<i>♪ Here is my handle</i>

14:51.158 --> 14:52.459
<i>♪ Here is my...</i>

15:54.756 --> 15:56.891
Jubilee... No.

16:03.765 --> 16:05.365
Daddy loves you.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.269
You love Daddy? Yeah?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.451
I'm the King of the Snow Blast!

17:01.856 --> 17:04.491
Good morning, everyone!

17:16.569 --> 17:17.570
Huh?

17:21.540 --> 17:25.077
Uh...
Look, about last night, I...

17:25.079 --> 17:28.079
There you are!
Come on! You're needed!

17:28.082 --> 17:30.015
But I haven't even
had breakfast.

17:30.017 --> 17:32.252
Later. Let's go.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.099
What's the emergency?

17:47.101 --> 17:48.736
There's no time to waste!

17:48.970 --> 17:51.038
Preparations
are behind schedule.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.907
Where's your crown?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.642
Fish on a stick! One second.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.292
What?

18:16.764 --> 18:19.299
You lost the crown?

18:19.633 --> 18:21.501
No, I didn't lose it.

18:21.702 --> 18:24.369
I'm just questioning the whole
concept of object permanence.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.773
It was there, now it's gone.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.775
Science. Go figure.

18:28.142 --> 18:30.441
This is a disaster, Norm!

18:30.443 --> 18:31.746
Everything okay, honey?

18:33.014 --> 18:35.981
Uh, yeah.
Everything's fine, dear.

18:35.983 --> 18:38.518
Perfect. Never better.
Livin' the dream.

18:40.121 --> 18:44.389
I told you, Norm.
The crown isn't just a symbol!

18:44.391 --> 18:46.691
I know. It's a responsibility.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.660
Apparently, you don't know!

18:48.662 --> 18:50.695
Without the crown,
the Jubilee festival

18:50.697 --> 18:52.397
can't be completed.

18:52.399 --> 18:55.466
We're gonna be cursed
by an endless winter.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.771
What? That story,
it's just a superstition.

18:58.773 --> 19:00.672
It's decreed!

19:00.674 --> 19:03.110
If the King of the North
doesn't crown the ice tower

19:03.577 --> 19:05.412
during the Jubilee festival,

19:05.713 --> 19:09.784
an endless winter
will fall upon the North.

19:12.419 --> 19:15.455
It's our history, Norm.

19:15.957 --> 19:18.590
That's science.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.527
Oh, well, in that case...

19:44.018 --> 19:45.152
Huh?

19:45.953 --> 19:47.088
What is going on?

19:47.955 --> 19:50.657
I lost a contact lens.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.658
You don't wear contact lenses.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.495
Oh. You're right.

19:56.197 --> 19:58.163
What a relief! Mystery solved!

19:58.165 --> 20:01.635
Well, look at the time.
I gotta go do king stuff.

20:10.644 --> 20:14.547
Yes. What... What he said.

20:20.087 --> 20:21.155
Hmm.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.159
Hey, what's this?

20:25.960 --> 20:27.460
Those tracks...

20:41.042 --> 20:43.242
Don't look at me like that.

20:43.244 --> 20:46.714
You can't keep running away
from your duties, Norm.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.722
Enough!
You're wasting time!

20:57.191 --> 20:59.624
Hey, Tiny! What's up, my whale?

20:59.626 --> 21:02.696
- Can I ask you a question?
- I don't know, can you?

21:03.197 --> 21:06.699
May I? I may.
I mean, it's really important.

21:06.701 --> 21:08.801
These ski tracks,
you didn't, perhaps,

21:08.803 --> 21:10.104
see who made them?

21:10.670 --> 21:13.272
Even if I did,
why should I tell you, bear?

21:13.274 --> 21:17.577
What? No, I'm not just a bear.
I'm Norm, King of the North.

21:17.845 --> 21:19.812
Norm, where's your crown?

21:19.814 --> 21:21.546
Huh? See?

21:21.548 --> 21:23.015
I'm having it cleaned.

21:23.017 --> 21:24.883
Look, Tiny,
you don't remember seeing

21:24.885 --> 21:27.188
anything suspicious
about last night, do you?

21:27.620 --> 21:28.621
Hmm.

21:28.956 --> 21:32.324
Do I remember?

21:32.326 --> 21:35.127
Yeah. Suspicious?
Weird? Bizarre?

21:35.129 --> 21:37.865
Oh, I do remember something!

21:38.065 --> 21:39.630
Great! What?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.266
I remember

21:41.268 --> 21:45.006
you not inviting me and my pod
to the Jubilee festival!

21:45.339 --> 21:48.042
Something about us
being "killer whales."

21:51.712 --> 21:53.812
I meant that as a compliment.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.782
You know,
you're a "killer", whale.

21:56.784 --> 21:59.318
Right.
Killer-comma-whale.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.156
Ooh,
darn those misplaced modifiers.

22:02.890 --> 22:05.059
- Ask me nicely.
- Please.

22:05.726 --> 22:06.961
- Nicer.
- Pretty please?

22:07.194 --> 22:09.128
- Nicer.
- Pretty please?

22:09.130 --> 22:10.965
With sugar and lemmings on top?

22:11.165 --> 22:13.065
Yeesh. That's kinda gross.

22:13.067 --> 22:16.702
Please tell me,
did you see anything?

22:16.704 --> 22:19.938
Well, I do remember
a strange ship.

22:19.940 --> 22:20.875
What kind of ship?

22:21.876 --> 22:23.911
It's all so hazy.
It might've been a dream.

22:26.047 --> 22:28.548
Oh, let me check my Sonar Chat.

22:30.918 --> 22:33.185
- Sonar Chat?
- It's an app.

22:33.187 --> 22:35.821
Whales invented it,
and they never fail

22:35.823 --> 22:37.091
to brag about it.

23:54.935 --> 23:56.137
I was right!

23:56.337 --> 24:00.372
There was a ship
entirely made out of ice.

24:00.374 --> 24:03.408
The strangest ship
you'll ever see.

24:03.410 --> 24:04.311
Where?

24:04.745 --> 24:06.981
It's headed towards China,

24:07.715 --> 24:09.781
and it has this symbol on it.

24:09.783 --> 24:13.020
I believe it belongs
to the city of Harbin.

24:14.121 --> 24:16.054
- In China?
- China.

24:16.056 --> 24:18.359
- China?
- Am I saying it wrong?

24:18.959 --> 24:20.693
China.

24:21.128 --> 24:24.329
I've been to China.
It's a long way from here.

24:24.331 --> 24:26.133
Well, you better get going then.

24:32.473 --> 24:34.341
Nobody must know you're gone.

24:34.842 --> 24:37.409
What am I gonna tell
Elizabeth and the kids?

24:37.411 --> 24:40.245
- Nothing.
- I can't lie to my family.

24:40.247 --> 24:42.414
Well, it's not lying
if you don't say anything.

24:42.416 --> 24:44.082
I guess so.

24:44.084 --> 24:47.388
But still, Harbin?
And I can't tell my family.

24:48.322 --> 24:49.821
We're going to Harbin?

24:49.823 --> 24:51.358
Where's Harbin?

24:56.964 --> 24:59.965
Wow! Dad's taking us
on a vacation!

24:59.967 --> 25:01.833
He's trying to make it up to us.

25:01.835 --> 25:04.002
In Harbin, China!

25:04.004 --> 25:06.805
I'd feel really bad
if they ever found out.

25:06.807 --> 25:08.373
They won't find out,

25:08.375 --> 25:11.543
and the bigger question is,
how are you going to get there?

25:18.185 --> 25:19.153
Really?

25:25.359 --> 25:27.859
I've gotta go see a moose
about an ice floe.

25:27.861 --> 25:31.797
And how about, uh,
my sister just had cubs!

25:31.799 --> 25:33.899
Oh, she knows
I don't have a sister.

25:33.901 --> 25:36.068
You sly bear, you.

25:36.070 --> 25:38.036
Sly? Me? What?

25:38.038 --> 25:40.105
I know what you're up to.

25:40.107 --> 25:42.474
- You do?
- Yeah, we heard everything!

25:42.476 --> 25:44.011
Everything? Uh...

25:44.278 --> 25:46.945
- I don't know what to say.
- Me, neither.

25:46.947 --> 25:48.547
Did you really think
you could plan

25:48.549 --> 25:50.549
a surprise vacation
to Harbin, China

25:50.551 --> 25:52.284
without telling us?

25:52.286 --> 25:53.819
Vaca... What?

25:53.821 --> 25:55.187
You rock, Dad!

25:55.189 --> 25:58.357
Dad! Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad! Dad!

25:58.359 --> 26:01.426
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Surprise!

26:01.428 --> 26:03.864
Dad! Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad! Dad!

26:16.110 --> 26:17.242
Okay.

26:17.244 --> 26:19.177
It's no luxury liner,

26:19.179 --> 26:21.215
but it looks like
it'll hold Norm...

26:21.482 --> 26:23.417
and his family?

26:25.319 --> 26:27.586
No use hiding it anymore,
Socrates.

26:27.588 --> 26:30.422
They found out about
the surprise vacation

26:30.424 --> 26:32.426
that I planned on purpose.

26:32.626 --> 26:35.329
- What?
- Ta-da!

26:39.300 --> 26:41.902
Oh.

26:42.336 --> 26:44.569
Yeah.

26:44.571 --> 26:46.605
This is funny because it's not.

26:46.607 --> 26:48.006
Yeah, just go with it.

26:48.008 --> 26:49.241
What's the worst
that can happen?

27:19.073 --> 27:20.140
We're doomed.

27:23.677 --> 27:27.646
Well, here's a wrinkle
in the old Jubilee game plan.

27:27.648 --> 27:30.515
If King Norm doesn't place
his crown on top of the tower

27:30.517 --> 27:32.584
by the official
beginning of winter,

27:32.586 --> 27:33.987
chaos will ensue.

27:35.189 --> 27:37.489
We're talkin' about the end
of the North as we know it.

27:37.491 --> 27:41.259
You're talking about polar bears
eating polar bears?

27:41.261 --> 27:43.228
Lemmings eating lemmings?

27:43.230 --> 27:45.566
A muskrat eating,
like, a muskox?

27:46.066 --> 27:47.067
Yes, Rick.

27:48.168 --> 27:50.504
We're talking about an endless
winter of disaster.

28:12.727 --> 28:14.226
Gross!

28:14.228 --> 28:16.995
Get your nasty foot
away from my face.

28:16.997 --> 28:19.564
Well, if Quinn
would move his elbow.

28:22.603 --> 28:25.637
- Stop kicking! Quinn?
- It wasn't me.

28:25.639 --> 28:28.673
- Chase?
- He's lying!

28:30.377 --> 28:32.177
What is going on out here?

28:32.179 --> 28:33.645
Family photo op!

28:33.647 --> 28:36.615
I borrowed this from Vera
for our new family portrait.

28:36.617 --> 28:37.918
Come on, kids.
Everyone in.

28:40.154 --> 28:42.020
Perfect.

28:42.022 --> 28:44.124
Everyone say, "Harbin!"

28:44.491 --> 28:45.659
Huh?

28:48.095 --> 28:49.396
Harbin!

28:51.131 --> 28:52.132
Norm?

28:52.499 --> 28:55.035
Sorry, it's just, uh...

28:55.302 --> 28:56.403
I'll be back.

29:00.007 --> 29:01.575
- Honey?
- Be right down.

29:08.315 --> 29:12.686
Huh? You dirty,
dastardly, despicable...

29:13.353 --> 29:16.254
- Dear!
- What are you doing, Norm?

29:16.256 --> 29:18.392
Oh, you know,
looking for the perfect sunset.

29:19.159 --> 29:20.358
For the picture.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.162
I just want the light
to be perfect.

29:24.097 --> 29:26.364
Aw, you do care!

29:26.366 --> 29:29.802
Of course I do, honey.
I'm a bear that cares.

29:29.804 --> 29:32.406
Bearing is caring, right?

29:33.373 --> 29:35.476
Okay. Places, everyone.

30:07.407 --> 30:10.575
Hey, Elizabeth,
mind if I set the shot?

30:10.577 --> 30:11.844
Of course not.

30:19.386 --> 30:21.121
What's wrong, dear?

30:21.555 --> 30:24.757
Nothing. It's just
the composition is all wrong.

30:24.759 --> 30:27.461
The background, the lighting.
This just won't do.

30:31.598 --> 30:34.533
Crew, this is your captain,
port to bow.

30:34.535 --> 30:36.368
I mean, starboard to aft.

30:36.370 --> 30:40.372
I mean, turn this tub around!
Lemmings, abort! Abort!

30:40.374 --> 30:41.776
Norm, the background is fine.

30:45.312 --> 30:46.446
A little to the left.

30:51.485 --> 30:53.520
Too far.
No, a little to the right.

30:54.655 --> 30:55.823
Uh...

31:02.764 --> 31:04.462
Everyone say...

31:04.464 --> 31:06.366
Jump!

31:13.440 --> 31:14.675
Cheese.

31:35.495 --> 31:36.829
Dad, where's the water?

31:36.831 --> 31:38.530
How are we gonna get to land?

31:38.532 --> 31:40.800
I don't know. Guys, guys,
it's just an inconvenience.

31:40.802 --> 31:42.302
I've got this.

31:43.270 --> 31:44.804
Fong?

31:44.806 --> 31:46.671
<i>Hey, buddy!</i>

31:46.673 --> 31:48.808
<i>How's the vacation
going so far?</i>

31:48.810 --> 31:51.643
It's very, uh, ice.

31:51.645 --> 31:54.379
<i>Uh, don't you mean very "nice"?</i>

31:54.381 --> 31:56.550
No, I mean very "ice."

32:00.621 --> 32:03.455
<i>Oh, dear!
I'm on my way.</i>

32:36.824 --> 32:39.861
Wakey wakey,
eggs and bakey!

32:49.871 --> 32:52.740
Welcome to Harbin!

32:58.445 --> 33:00.645
This looks amazing!

33:00.647 --> 33:04.752
See? You give your Dad lemons
and he makes vacation-ade!

33:06.888 --> 33:09.989
Wow! Whoa!

33:09.991 --> 33:11.826
That's mega cool!

33:26.808 --> 33:29.909
Wait! Hold up.
Let's stay together.

33:29.911 --> 33:31.445
- I got Maria.
- I'm on Chase.

33:31.813 --> 33:34.514
You guys vacation hardcore.

33:35.950 --> 33:37.250
Norm?

33:39.386 --> 33:40.687
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

34:23.597 --> 34:24.598
Ah!

34:41.547 --> 34:42.581
Chase?

34:43.483 --> 34:44.583
Chase?

34:53.527 --> 34:54.494
Ha!

35:20.654 --> 35:22.955
Uh, Maria, what are you doing?

35:22.957 --> 35:24.522
The Watusi!

35:24.524 --> 35:25.760
What are you doing?

35:26.894 --> 35:31.631
Oh, oh! I don't know.
These beats are taking me over.

35:32.133 --> 35:35.669
Watch yourself.

35:43.077 --> 35:44.678
Back it up, back it up.

35:46.914 --> 35:49.449
Oh, sorry about your foot.

35:51.819 --> 35:53.087
<i>♪ Let's do it! ♪</i>

the moves.

36:39.867 --> 36:41.035
Maria?

36:51.078 --> 36:52.445
Huh?

36:53.948 --> 36:55.147
Hmm.

37:05.092 --> 37:08.428
Are you okay?

37:15.602 --> 37:17.102
I'm fine.

37:17.104 --> 37:18.072
Huh?

37:18.272 --> 37:19.639
Those tracks.

37:23.244 --> 37:25.177
- He's here!
- Who's here?

37:25.179 --> 37:28.247
Who... Me! I'm here.

37:28.249 --> 37:30.282
You're funny, Dad.

37:30.284 --> 37:33.052
I'm a laugh a minute.
Where's my off button?

37:33.054 --> 37:35.022
Come on.
Let's get you back to Mom.

37:39.693 --> 37:41.062
Chase?

37:43.064 --> 37:44.899
Check this out, Mom!

37:52.306 --> 37:53.941
Thank you.
Thank you. Yeah.

37:54.175 --> 37:55.943
Oh, no autographs, please.

37:57.011 --> 38:00.647
That's beautiful, but let's go.
We're supposed to stay together.

38:27.208 --> 38:29.775
Come one, come all.
Before your very eyes,

38:29.777 --> 38:32.878
Harbin's largest collection
of rarities!

38:32.880 --> 38:36.581
You, my friend.
You! Yes, you.

38:36.583 --> 38:40.087
I got pandas and snow tigers
and monkeys of every kind,

38:40.587 --> 38:42.990
all belonging to Harbin's
noble history.

38:44.125 --> 38:47.793
This is the real deal, kid.
The deal that's real.

38:47.795 --> 38:49.864
One hundred percent seal.

38:53.100 --> 38:55.002
Ooh. What's that?

38:56.237 --> 38:58.603
Uh, shell-oculars.

38:58.605 --> 39:02.777
Made from genuine 100 percent
pure plastic.

39:13.754 --> 39:14.822
Oh, man.

39:15.022 --> 39:17.058
Let me guess. Pete?

39:17.258 --> 39:20.995
- No, I'm Repete.
- And I'm Pete.

39:24.298 --> 39:26.231
No, we're kidding.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.167
- I'm Pete.
- And I'm Repete.

39:30.237 --> 39:32.137
Oh, man.
Every time.

39:32.139 --> 39:34.740
Oh, you've gotta love
those twins.

39:40.680 --> 39:43.050
- I'll take it!
- That'll be 20 cubes.

39:43.951 --> 39:46.318
I don't have any money
on me right now.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.053
Seriously?

39:48.055 --> 39:51.957
But my dad is King of the North,
I mean, he's good for it.

39:51.959 --> 39:53.859
King of the North? Yeah.

39:53.861 --> 39:56.061
And I'm the Dragon of the East.

39:56.063 --> 39:57.729
Huh?

39:57.731 --> 40:01.934
I was born at night,
but I wasn't born last night.

40:01.936 --> 40:03.270
Give me that.

40:08.976 --> 40:10.177
There you are!

40:10.878 --> 40:14.813
Norm! Watch where you're going.
You hurt them.

40:14.815 --> 40:16.681
Oh, dear.
Are you two all right?

40:16.683 --> 40:17.785
They're fine.

40:18.886 --> 40:21.253
What am I going to do
with you two?

40:21.255 --> 40:22.189
Dad!

40:23.157 --> 40:24.156
What are you doing
out of your workshop?

40:24.158 --> 40:27.660
Making sure my Frostbite 3000
is operational.

40:46.847 --> 40:50.084
Master Fu, you are amazing!

40:50.818 --> 40:52.720
Good to see you, sir.

40:53.053 --> 40:55.120
Good to see you all.

40:55.122 --> 40:57.091
Sorry I haven't been out more.

40:57.291 --> 40:59.424
I've been... busy.

40:59.426 --> 41:01.293
It's okay, Mister Fu, sir.

41:01.295 --> 41:03.696
You honor us with your presence.

41:04.932 --> 41:06.033
Welcome to Harbin.

41:07.234 --> 41:11.705
I am Fu, Harbin designer,
inventor, architect and father.

41:14.408 --> 41:17.476
You're him?
I mean, he's you?

41:17.478 --> 41:20.447
You're the one
who designed this entire city?

41:20.981 --> 41:25.017
Every single thing you see.

41:25.019 --> 41:27.920
Oh, that's mega cool!

41:27.922 --> 41:29.388
I gotta say, I love your work.

41:29.390 --> 41:30.923
Can I have
your autograph?

41:30.925 --> 41:31.890
Kids, come on.

41:31.892 --> 41:34.762
He's a designer,
but your old man is a king.

41:35.062 --> 41:36.495
I thought so.

41:36.497 --> 41:38.897
You're Norm,
the King of the North!

41:38.899 --> 41:41.333
- Guilty as charged.
- Told ya.

41:41.335 --> 41:43.068
What brings you to Harbin?

41:43.070 --> 41:45.706
A long overdue family vacation.

41:45.940 --> 41:48.207
Just before
the Northern Jubilee?

41:48.209 --> 41:49.210
Strange.

41:50.244 --> 41:53.011
It's never the wrong time
for family fun, huh?

41:53.013 --> 41:54.980
Are you staying for the weekend?

41:54.982 --> 41:57.249
My birthday is coming up,
and I would be honored

41:57.251 --> 41:58.350
to have you join me.

41:58.352 --> 41:59.353
What? No!

42:00.454 --> 42:02.521
Dad, we thought it was just
gonna be the three of us

42:02.523 --> 42:05.023
- for your birthday this year.
- Thanks for the offer,

42:05.025 --> 42:06.825
but we won't be staying
that long.

42:06.827 --> 42:08.929
We all have to get back
to the North for the Jubilee.

42:09.296 --> 42:11.232
- Phew!
- I understand.

42:11.432 --> 42:14.132
Well then,
it would be my honor

42:14.134 --> 42:17.369
to at least invite all of you
for dinner tonight.

42:17.371 --> 42:19.106
- We can't.
- We'd love to.

42:19.306 --> 42:21.375
- Oh.
- I can't.

42:22.443 --> 42:23.877
It'll be our pleasure.

42:26.313 --> 42:27.948
We'll be there.

42:29.183 --> 42:30.150
Excellent.

42:31.285 --> 42:33.954
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must return to my work.

42:38.959 --> 42:41.360
What do you mean, you can't?

42:41.362 --> 42:43.061
We're on a family vacation.

42:43.063 --> 42:44.098
I know.

42:45.199 --> 42:47.065
Uh, look, I have plans.
Things to do, people to see.

42:47.067 --> 42:48.168
I'll explain later.

43:24.405 --> 43:26.507
Look! It's snowing!

44:13.020 --> 44:14.955
Ha!

44:20.260 --> 44:21.595
What?

44:22.663 --> 44:24.498
Hmm. Hmm?

44:39.980 --> 44:41.014
Hmm.

44:43.450 --> 44:45.652
Thank you, Fu.
Dinner was delicious.

44:46.153 --> 44:47.654
You're too kind.

44:49.724 --> 44:51.158
Wow!

44:52.659 --> 44:54.326
Cool!

44:54.328 --> 44:56.096
So pretty!

44:56.296 --> 44:58.298
Look at all those trophies.

44:59.099 --> 45:01.466
- You must be so proud.
- Oh, yeah.

45:01.468 --> 45:04.271
Skiing was my favorite thing
to do with my family.

45:04.571 --> 45:06.405
Why did you stop?

45:06.407 --> 45:08.573
Well, Harbin takes up
all of my time.

45:08.575 --> 45:11.510
Cities don't build themselves,
you know.

45:11.512 --> 45:12.579
Who knows?

45:13.680 --> 45:15.447
Maybe if our father was made
a king like your father,

45:15.449 --> 45:17.115
he'd have the time
to take ski vacations

45:17.117 --> 45:20.252
- with his family again.
- And watch me win?

45:20.254 --> 45:23.355
Uh, yeah, right.
He never beats me.

45:23.357 --> 45:26.324
So, by never,
you mean all the time?

45:26.326 --> 45:28.293
- I own him.
- In your dreams!

45:28.295 --> 45:30.197
Boys, please.

45:30.732 --> 45:32.732
- Sorry.
- Yeah. Sorry.

45:32.734 --> 45:35.402
- I'm more sorry!
- Nuh-uh! I'm more sorry!

45:38.405 --> 45:40.441
You guys
are really lucky.

45:42.276 --> 45:43.677
- You have no idea.
- As if!

45:44.712 --> 45:46.146
Oh, you're serious?

45:46.714 --> 45:48.146
Come, now.

45:48.148 --> 45:50.584
I've had the guest room
prepared for you.

45:56.290 --> 45:57.558
What was that?

45:57.792 --> 46:00.592
Why, that's just
the Slide to the Heavens.

46:00.594 --> 46:03.063
It goes right through
the main hall.

46:18.312 --> 46:20.180
Ha!

46:39.299 --> 46:42.334
Oh, man. I hate stairs.

46:50.177 --> 46:51.245
Easy.

47:21.174 --> 47:22.442
Fu stole my crown!

47:34.154 --> 47:35.222
Huh?

48:15.495 --> 48:16.496
Ha!

48:36.450 --> 48:37.682
That's half.

48:40.888 --> 48:42.857
That's just bad architecture.

48:44.358 --> 48:45.559
Gotcha!

48:48.195 --> 48:49.764
Oh, man!

48:52.867 --> 48:53.868
Oh, no.

49:11.418 --> 49:12.419
- <i>Yello?</i>
- Norm?

49:13.487 --> 49:14.352
<i>You've reached
Norm's summer home.</i>

49:14.354 --> 49:16.223
<i>Some are home, some are not.</i>

49:16.523 --> 49:17.723
<i>Leave a message at the beep.</i>

49:19.393 --> 49:22.928
Two days, Norm!
We've only got two days left!

49:22.930 --> 49:25.664
If it gets out
that you've lost your crown,

49:25.666 --> 49:27.967
everyone's gonna freak out!

49:43.951 --> 49:46.386
Quiet!

49:49.724 --> 49:51.893
Calm down!

49:53.560 --> 49:56.394
Yes, the crown has gone missing,

49:56.396 --> 49:59.765
but Norm is doing everything
in his power to fix it.

49:59.767 --> 50:03.236
So... keep calm...

50:05.539 --> 50:07.441
...and Jubilee on.

50:12.579 --> 50:14.880
Norm has lost the crown.

50:14.882 --> 50:17.917
The Jubilee is approaching
and our very existence

50:17.919 --> 50:19.684
is now at risk.

50:19.686 --> 50:21.921
Yep.
Things are definitely curdling

50:21.923 --> 50:25.325
in the old butter mill
of disaster there, Jim.

50:39.539 --> 50:41.308
Huh? Norm?

50:45.612 --> 50:47.014
Get out of here.

50:51.753 --> 50:53.988
Uh, where's your father?

50:54.856 --> 50:56.621
- No idea.
- No clue.

50:56.623 --> 50:58.523
Guys, I think your dad
is in trouble.

50:58.525 --> 50:59.992
Dad? In trouble?

50:59.994 --> 51:02.527
- Shocker.
- He's probably still working.

51:02.529 --> 51:06.065
Yeah. "The crown never rests."

51:06.067 --> 51:08.901
No, Dad always comes home.

51:08.903 --> 51:11.638
If he's not here,
it means trouble.

51:12.006 --> 51:14.439
Mission improbable. Find Dad.

51:14.441 --> 51:17.408
- Booyah!
- Quinn, you take the fair.

51:17.410 --> 51:19.377
Maria, you take the ski slope.

51:19.379 --> 51:20.680
- Chase...
- I'm on the rides!

51:21.082 --> 51:23.785
Operation Dad Retrieval is a go!

51:27.822 --> 51:30.622
First rule of Dad,
he is always probably

51:30.624 --> 51:32.557
where you least expect him
to be.

51:32.559 --> 51:35.695
Dad would never ski!

51:36.097 --> 51:38.532
Dad would never
ride a roller coaster.

51:39.934 --> 51:42.435
Where's the last place
Dad should be?

51:42.770 --> 51:44.806
That's probably where he is.

51:48.542 --> 51:49.975
I got nothing.

51:58.085 --> 52:00.420
Where could he possibly be?

53:04.584 --> 53:06.419
Huh? Hmm.

53:14.628 --> 53:16.764
Hey, Pete. Talk to me, bro.

53:36.549 --> 53:37.682
- <i>Hello? Who is this?</i>
- Shh.

53:37.684 --> 53:38.685
<i>Let me out!</i>

53:43.124 --> 53:45.925
<i>Lemmings! Thank heaven!
It's a trap door.</i>

53:45.927 --> 53:47.995
<i>The trigger is one
of the trophies,</i>

53:48.695 --> 53:50.863
<i>which I'm pretty sure
half of them are fake.</i>

53:50.865 --> 53:52.833
<i>I mean, come on.
No one's that good at anything.</i>

54:01.108 --> 54:03.776
Have you seen
a big huggable polar bear

54:03.778 --> 54:07.545
about yay big and answers
to the name of "Dad?"

54:07.547 --> 54:10.718
Only some of the time.
Mostly, he's just "King."

54:10.918 --> 54:12.718
Uh, I don't know.

54:12.720 --> 54:16.922
He's not even in the nap caves.
He loves naps and caves.

54:16.924 --> 54:19.024
Now I'm really concerned.

54:19.026 --> 54:20.460
Where's Chase?

54:28.803 --> 54:30.838
What? Nervous eating.

54:33.140 --> 54:35.675
Wait a minute.
Maybe Fu can help.

55:36.270 --> 55:39.004
What in the Northern Lights
are you doing?

55:39.006 --> 55:42.074
Get down from there.
Have you gone mad?

55:42.076 --> 55:44.145
You can't just destroy
Fu's home.

55:44.745 --> 55:46.211
We're his guests here!

55:46.213 --> 55:49.016
- <i>Elizabeth! Is that you?</i>
- Norm?

55:49.616 --> 55:51.984
- Dad?
- Norm, where are you?

55:51.986 --> 55:53.087
<i>Behind the trap door!</i>

55:55.756 --> 55:57.356
What are you doing in there?

55:57.358 --> 55:59.659
<i>Well, I'm trapped.</i>

55:59.860 --> 56:01.226
Of course!

56:01.228 --> 56:02.828
Getting trapped
in a secret room

56:02.830 --> 56:05.066
is the last place
you'd expect Dad to be.

56:13.707 --> 56:17.044
Was it not obvious to everyone
that it was a trap statue?

56:22.016 --> 56:24.718
Oh, hang on.

56:25.219 --> 56:27.820
Almost.
I'm just gonna suck it in.

56:42.703 --> 56:44.937
Oh, I missed you all so much!

56:44.939 --> 56:47.406
Oh, I thought I'd never
see you guys again.

56:47.408 --> 56:49.341
I'm so happy.
I'm so relieved.

56:49.343 --> 56:51.143
- I'm so...
- Not telling us

56:51.145 --> 56:52.346
what's really going on.

56:53.147 --> 56:55.149
Uh, what are you implying?

56:55.749 --> 56:57.082
Enough of that, Norm.

56:57.084 --> 56:58.951
You've been acting
weird since day one.

56:58.953 --> 57:00.219
What are you hiding?

57:00.221 --> 57:02.957
You won't think the same of me
if I tell you.

57:03.824 --> 57:05.993
There's nothing
you can't tell us.

57:06.193 --> 57:08.062
- Right, kids?
- Right!

57:09.130 --> 57:12.297
Well, the truth is...

57:12.299 --> 57:13.701
<i>You did what?</i>

57:16.170 --> 57:19.371
- I should've known. Classic Dad.
- What are you talking about?

57:19.373 --> 57:22.207
This trip was never
about spending time with us.

57:22.209 --> 57:25.010
It was about you
and that stupid crown.

57:25.012 --> 57:27.179
No! Well, yes.

57:27.181 --> 57:30.983
Well, it wasn't at first,
but it is now.

57:30.985 --> 57:33.218
You know that you're all
that matters to me.

57:33.220 --> 57:35.420
- Are we?
- Of course you are,

57:35.422 --> 57:37.055
but if I don't retrieve
the crown

57:37.057 --> 57:39.791
before the beginning of winter
at the Jubilee tomorrow,

57:39.793 --> 57:42.361
an endless winter
will fall upon the North

57:42.363 --> 57:44.263
and I'll be known
as the worst king ever.

57:44.265 --> 57:46.298
That's not the only thing
you'll be known as.

57:46.300 --> 57:47.900
Quinn, stop.

57:47.902 --> 57:49.268
No, he's right.

57:49.270 --> 57:51.136
I haven't been
the best dad recently.

57:51.138 --> 57:54.339
Recently? Try ever since
you became king!

57:54.341 --> 57:55.242
Quinn!

57:55.943 --> 57:56.944
No, Quinn. Come on.

57:58.245 --> 57:59.880
Come back!

58:00.814 --> 58:04.084
I heard yelling and...
Dear heavens, my awards!

58:05.953 --> 58:07.755
What have you done
to my beautiful trophies?

58:07.955 --> 58:09.421
Your trophies?

58:09.423 --> 58:11.425
What have you done
with my crown?

58:12.760 --> 58:15.162
And what in the world
is that room?

58:15.496 --> 58:18.030
Oh, don't give me that.

58:18.032 --> 58:19.765
I'm on to you, Fu.

58:19.767 --> 58:21.333
All these fake awards
mean nothing

58:21.335 --> 58:24.503
without the one true trophy,
my crown.

58:24.505 --> 58:27.339
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

58:27.341 --> 58:28.407
Oh, yeah?

58:28.409 --> 58:30.044
Then how do you explain...

58:31.345 --> 58:32.411
this?

58:32.413 --> 58:33.447
Dear heavens.

58:36.550 --> 58:39.952
- I've been robbed.
- Oh, don't play dumb.

58:39.954 --> 58:42.187
I know you stole my crown, Fu.

58:42.189 --> 58:43.090
The skis...

58:44.191 --> 58:46.994
the mask, the gloves...

58:49.163 --> 58:52.399
the frost-pedo,
everything points to you.

58:53.267 --> 58:56.370
On my honor,
I didn't take your crown.

58:59.807 --> 59:03.043
- See? My key is gone!
- Huh?

59:03.444 --> 59:07.114
The only people that know
where I keep it are me and my...

59:11.585 --> 59:13.320
The twins!

59:30.938 --> 59:32.273
There! Tracks!

59:43.217 --> 59:44.883
They're good kids.

59:44.885 --> 59:47.288
I don't know why
they'd do such a thing.

59:49.023 --> 59:51.925
Excuse me.
I'm so ashamed.

59:56.030 --> 59:57.898
Fu, wait!

01:00:32.599 --> 01:00:34.568
What in the world
happened back there?

01:00:39.006 --> 01:00:40.007
Fu?

01:00:40.507 --> 01:00:41.875
Oh, no.

01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:43.410
Don't cry.

01:00:43.677 --> 01:00:47.214
- It's okay.
- We all have bad days.

01:00:48.582 --> 01:00:51.585
And your crying
is making me sad too.

01:00:59.626 --> 01:01:01.929
I forgive you.
It's all good.

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:05.432
I mean, kids can do
some crazy things.

01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:06.965
Take Chase.

01:01:06.967 --> 01:01:08.633
He once ate
an entire wedding cake

01:01:08.635 --> 01:01:10.971
and he wasn't even invited
to the wedding.

01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:13.305
It's not that.

01:01:13.307 --> 01:01:17.444
I just feel so much pressure
to make my twins proud.

01:01:18.011 --> 01:01:21.348
That's really why I work
so hard on Harbin.

01:01:23.517 --> 01:01:26.220
That they would be proud
of their father.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.956
But you're such a big,
strong tiger.

01:01:29.156 --> 01:01:31.525
They even built a statue
just for you.

01:01:32.326 --> 01:01:35.095
That was just the twins
trying to cheer me up.

01:01:37.331 --> 01:01:39.299
They deserve better than me.

01:01:41.502 --> 01:01:43.437
Being a dad is hard,

01:01:43.637 --> 01:01:46.407
especially when you have
an entire city counting on you.

01:01:46.607 --> 01:01:48.142
So are my kids.

01:01:48.442 --> 01:01:51.345
Trust me, your kids love you...

01:01:52.179 --> 01:01:53.678
even if they don't know
the real trouble

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.115
they're causing.

01:01:57.684 --> 01:01:59.618
I need your help, Fu.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.120
The North is counting on me
to return with the crown,

01:02:02.122 --> 01:02:03.288
like, yesterday.

01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:05.058
Do you know where
they might have it?

01:02:10.597 --> 01:02:11.698
Follow me.

01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:18.303
- We got your text.
- Thanks for coming.

01:02:18.305 --> 01:02:20.708
Always, Dad. We're a family.

01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:29.349
Yeah, we are.

01:02:31.118 --> 01:02:32.284
Hmm.

01:02:32.286 --> 01:02:34.186
There's only one place
where my twins

01:02:34.188 --> 01:02:35.589
could be hiding your crown.

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.392
Nothing is gonna stop us now!

01:02:40.093 --> 01:02:43.028
Nothing except maybe
that icy ascent.

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.450
I guess it could be worse.
It could be snowing.

01:03:11.325 --> 01:03:15.162
It's worse than worse.
I can't do this.

01:03:15.429 --> 01:03:18.999
You can do this, Dad.
You're King of the North.

01:03:19.266 --> 01:03:21.500
Even more than that,
you're my dad.

01:03:21.502 --> 01:03:23.103
Our dad!

01:03:23.303 --> 01:03:25.072
The king of our family.

01:03:32.279 --> 01:03:33.748
I can do this!

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.560
You're kidding me, right?

01:03:48.562 --> 01:03:51.298
What? It was such
a nice family moment.

01:03:51.565 --> 01:03:54.666
I mean, you could climb
the side of this peak

01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:57.337
or we could just go inside.

01:03:59.606 --> 01:04:00.607
Good idea.

01:04:05.345 --> 01:04:07.245
What is this place?

01:04:07.247 --> 01:04:09.349
This was our old family home.

01:04:09.616 --> 01:04:11.683
I built this place
a long time ago

01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:13.554
to protect my family
from danger.

01:04:14.321 --> 01:04:15.687
- It's booby-trapped.
- Huh?

01:04:15.689 --> 01:04:18.458
Only the twins and I know
where all the traps are.

01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:23.798
Okay, then.

01:04:24.531 --> 01:04:25.532
After you.

01:04:27.835 --> 01:04:30.738
Just follow my every step
and we'll be completely...

01:04:33.607 --> 01:04:36.510
...safe!

01:04:39.747 --> 01:04:41.849
Okay, so the first step's
a doozy.

01:04:45.652 --> 01:04:47.519
I better do this alone.

01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:50.324
No way, Dad.
We want in on the fun.

01:04:51.224 --> 01:04:54.292
- You guys are with me?
- This is a family affair.

01:04:54.294 --> 01:04:55.495
After you, Dad.

01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:10.410
Hmm?

01:05:15.482 --> 01:05:17.182
Heavens to polar bear.

01:05:17.184 --> 01:05:18.753
We're not gonna be ready
in time!

01:05:55.723 --> 01:05:58.556
Everything is in place
for a great Jubilee

01:05:58.558 --> 01:06:01.526
except for Norm and the crown.

01:06:01.528 --> 01:06:03.228
I'll tell ya, Rick,

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:06.431
it's all about
how badly Norm wants it.

01:06:06.433 --> 01:06:07.900
Does he have what it takes?

01:06:07.902 --> 01:06:10.836
He'll have to give 110 percent.

01:06:10.838 --> 01:06:13.571
Maybe even 111, Jim.

01:06:13.573 --> 01:06:15.975
It's gut check time, Rick.

01:06:15.977 --> 01:06:17.910
And you know
that that Norm there,

01:06:17.912 --> 01:06:19.947
he's got a real gut.

01:06:53.346 --> 01:06:54.347
Any ideas?

01:06:54.782 --> 01:06:56.347
- Over there.
- This way!

01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:57.517
That way!

01:07:03.657 --> 01:07:05.692
I've got something.
This way!

01:07:06.426 --> 01:07:07.360
Are you sure?

01:07:07.661 --> 01:07:08.928
One way to find out.

01:07:11.698 --> 01:07:14.869
Pete, Repete,
this is your father, Fu.

01:07:17.337 --> 01:07:20.672
<i>Pete, Repete,
this is your father, Fu.</i>

01:07:20.674 --> 01:07:21.943
<i>This is your father, Fu.</i>

01:07:22.844 --> 01:07:24.777
Nice try, Quinn,
but they're never gonna fall

01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:27.347
- for something like...
- Dad? Is that you?

01:07:28.916 --> 01:07:30.317
You were saying?

01:07:33.888 --> 01:07:34.989
Huh?

01:07:38.025 --> 01:07:39.326
Oh, no!

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.010
Snow Blast!

01:08:40.787 --> 01:08:41.688
Yes!

01:09:07.514 --> 01:09:08.448
Ha!

01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:36.509
Yeah, woo! Yeah!

01:10:53.586 --> 01:10:55.120
Dad, over here!

01:11:03.764 --> 01:11:08.102
Dad, are you okay?

01:11:08.936 --> 01:11:10.738
Maybe we should go out
and find him?

01:11:11.706 --> 01:11:12.873
I'll go first.

01:11:14.607 --> 01:11:15.710
No way!

01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:18.010
I'll go first.

01:11:18.012 --> 01:11:19.814
No, I will.

01:11:20.613 --> 01:11:22.249
As if! I got this.

01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:29.090
Dad?

01:11:37.164 --> 01:11:38.531
Who's there?

01:11:39.699 --> 01:11:42.134
Come out of hiding,
whoever you really are.

01:11:42.136 --> 01:11:45.106
It's me, Norm,
King of the North.

01:11:48.809 --> 01:11:49.710
Aha!

01:11:50.311 --> 01:11:52.146
Come to papa bear.

01:11:52.612 --> 01:11:55.082
Oh, yeah.
That feels good.

01:11:56.017 --> 01:11:57.816
Uh, you...

01:11:57.818 --> 01:11:59.754
- I'm sorry.
- I'm more sorry.

01:12:02.289 --> 01:12:03.758
We're both sorry.

01:12:05.026 --> 01:12:07.326
We didn't mean to cause
so many problems.

01:12:07.328 --> 01:12:09.328
We just thought if we could give
our father

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:11.696
a surprise crown
for his birthday

01:12:11.698 --> 01:12:13.699
and let him know
how much we love him,

01:12:13.701 --> 01:12:16.603
he might feel a little more,
I don't know...

01:12:16.871 --> 01:12:17.872
Kingly.

01:12:36.656 --> 01:12:39.224
It's okay. I'm not mad at you.

01:12:39.226 --> 01:12:40.959
You just wanted
to help your father

01:12:40.961 --> 01:12:42.797
feel better about himself.

01:12:43.164 --> 01:12:46.666
But trust me,
a crown does not make a king.

01:12:48.002 --> 01:12:49.569
Family does.

01:12:50.337 --> 01:12:52.206
That's all that truly matters.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.916
I'm so sorry I've been
such a workaholic.

01:13:02.216 --> 01:13:04.983
I love you guys so much.

01:13:04.985 --> 01:13:07.188
- We love you too, Dad.
- We love you too, Dad.

01:13:21.702 --> 01:13:25.206
Just tell me how I can repay
you, Norm, and I will.

01:13:25.773 --> 01:13:26.740
Aw!

01:13:27.274 --> 01:13:29.842
Aw, heck, I just love everybody.

01:13:29.844 --> 01:13:32.311
Come on! Come here.
Come here, you guys.

01:13:32.313 --> 01:13:33.747
Get over here!

01:13:38.452 --> 01:13:40.452
All right. Everyone in.

01:13:40.454 --> 01:13:42.056
It's picture time.

01:13:50.731 --> 01:13:53.065
Whatever it is, it can wait.

01:13:53.067 --> 01:13:56.201
<i>This is an emergency, Norm!</i>

01:13:56.203 --> 01:13:58.137
<i>This can't wait!</i>

01:13:58.139 --> 01:14:00.708
<i>The Jubilee's already begun!</i>

01:14:12.019 --> 01:14:15.120
And the Jubilee festival
has begun.

01:14:15.122 --> 01:14:17.657
The pomp, the circumstance.

01:14:17.858 --> 01:14:20.792
And I am pumped for the pomp.

01:14:20.794 --> 01:14:24.265
Still no sign of Norm
or the crown, Rick.

01:14:25.366 --> 01:14:28.867
And that does not
bode well there, Jim.

01:14:28.869 --> 01:14:31.503
It's bad to the bone.

01:14:31.505 --> 01:14:35.007
A cold, hard, hungry
winter looms.

01:14:35.009 --> 01:14:38.777
Oh, it's gonna be a real down
and dirty humdinger

01:14:38.779 --> 01:14:41.815
if Norm doesn't get back here
with that crown.

01:14:54.295 --> 01:14:56.130
We have to go back, now!

01:15:02.903 --> 01:15:04.004
Slow down!

01:15:05.272 --> 01:15:07.539
Fong, I need you to pick us up
and fly us to the North A.S.A.P.

01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:09.143
<i>No can do, Norm.</i>

01:15:09.977 --> 01:15:12.844
We're right outside!
What do you mean, "No can do"?

01:15:12.846 --> 01:15:14.446
<i>Bad weather's brewing.</i>

01:15:14.448 --> 01:15:16.784
<i>The helicopter can't fly
in those conditions.</i>

01:15:17.084 --> 01:15:18.252
<i>Sorry, Norm.</i>

01:15:19.553 --> 01:15:22.056
Some king I turned out to be.

01:15:22.556 --> 01:15:24.122
I've cursed winter.

01:15:24.124 --> 01:15:25.125
Nonsense.

01:15:26.126 --> 01:15:27.793
We have a foolproof way
to get you back home.

01:15:27.795 --> 01:15:30.297
- Right, twins?
- Piece of cake, Dad.

01:15:32.833 --> 01:15:35.033
If anything can make it
through the storm,

01:15:35.035 --> 01:15:36.937
it's my ice ship.

01:15:38.272 --> 01:15:40.539
Take it, and good luck.

01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:42.975
You know, you guys should come
and visit sometime.

01:15:42.977 --> 01:15:46.313
I mean, in daylight
when we can actually see you.

01:15:51.018 --> 01:15:52.451
You guys gonna be okay?

01:15:52.453 --> 01:15:54.321
We're gonna be more than okay.

01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:57.858
I feel like a king.

01:16:13.073 --> 01:16:15.907
What do you say
we hit the slopes, boys?

01:16:15.909 --> 01:16:17.511
Yeah!

01:16:30.157 --> 01:16:33.494
Things are getting
really cold, really fast.

01:16:35.129 --> 01:16:37.462
Oh, where are you, Norm?

01:16:54.982 --> 01:16:56.383
It's too powerful!

01:17:23.377 --> 01:17:25.079
What a strange ship.

01:17:30.117 --> 01:17:31.118
Whoa!

01:17:32.186 --> 01:17:36.121
Everyone's expecting
an awe-inspiring performance

01:17:36.123 --> 01:17:37.991
from our orca-stra.

01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:41.295
Let's give them
something to remember!

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:04.151
We're not gonna make it!
It's too late. I failed.

01:18:09.123 --> 01:18:10.891
Everybody hold on!

01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:19.133
Jump!

01:18:34.214 --> 01:18:35.582
How did you know
where we were?

01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:37.618
Sonar Chat.

01:18:38.652 --> 01:18:41.688
Full speed ahead!

01:19:02.176 --> 01:19:04.576
It's go time, Jim!

01:19:04.578 --> 01:19:06.344
Here it is!

01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:15.322
Ooh.

01:19:16.356 --> 01:19:18.056
- Winter...
- Has...

01:19:18.058 --> 01:19:19.591
Arrived!

01:19:28.535 --> 01:19:30.068
Where is Norm?

01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:32.304
I thought you said
he was gonna be back by now.

01:19:32.306 --> 01:19:33.605
Yeah, with the crown!

01:19:33.607 --> 01:19:35.409
I did. He is.

01:19:35.777 --> 01:19:37.042
I think.

01:19:37.044 --> 01:19:40.178
We want Norm!
We want Norm!

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:46.551
We want Norm! We want Norm!
We want Norm! We want Norm!

01:19:46.553 --> 01:19:49.087
- Yeah, uh...
- We want Norm!

01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:58.398
This is going to be awkward.

01:20:01.703 --> 01:20:04.004
We're cursed, aren't we?

01:20:07.474 --> 01:20:09.543
We're gonna take that as a yes.

01:20:11.445 --> 01:20:14.081
The North is doomed!

01:20:20.153 --> 01:20:21.688
Not so fast!

01:20:23.156 --> 01:20:25.425
The King of the North is here!

01:20:26.627 --> 01:20:28.395
With his family!

01:20:36.203 --> 01:20:37.604
Always my luck.

01:20:40.507 --> 01:20:44.712
You can still do it, Norm!
Crown the tower!

01:20:55.289 --> 01:21:00.392
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!

01:21:00.394 --> 01:21:03.664
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it...

01:21:30.324 --> 01:21:31.325
Huh?

01:21:41.568 --> 01:21:43.871
Winter is here!

01:21:52.613 --> 01:21:56.283
You did it, Norm!
You saved the North!

01:21:56.483 --> 01:22:00.888
No, Socrates. We did it.
All of us. Together.

01:22:01.688 --> 01:22:03.823
I hope you've learned
your lesson

01:22:03.825 --> 01:22:05.925
about never losing
the crown again.

01:22:05.927 --> 01:22:07.829
I learned a more
important lesson.

01:22:08.395 --> 01:22:10.664
Life is all about balance.

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.934
- Are you okay?
- Never better.

01:22:14.936 --> 01:22:16.969
What did I just say
about not letting the crown

01:22:16.971 --> 01:22:18.104
out of your sight?

01:22:18.106 --> 01:22:21.341
