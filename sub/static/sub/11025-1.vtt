WEBVTT

01:21.899 --> 01:24.436
We got a stolen vehicle.

02:14.585 --> 02:16.064
Hello?

02:18.789 --> 02:20.359
Hello.

02:20.991 --> 02:22.231
Hi.

02:27.298 --> 02:30.279
How are you? Fine. You?

02:30.701 --> 02:32.146
Fine. Good!

02:34.972 --> 02:36.280
Where's the gate?

02:36.540 --> 02:38.076
Bye.

02:39.643 --> 02:41.213
Bye.

02:43.847 --> 02:46.919
You know, when Sonny gets an idea
in his head, he's just a mad man.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.030
I thought he was gonna kill me.

02:49.186 --> 02:51.063
Attica!

03:55.953 --> 03:57.933
- You're Billy's sister, right?
- Yeah.

03:58.088 --> 03:59.624
You seen him around?

03:59.790 --> 04:01.565
- Oh, Ollie.
- Speak of the devil.

04:01.725 --> 04:05.400
Yeah. Come on, man.
I told you, not here.

04:05.763 --> 04:08.710
- I'm sorry, man. I forgot what you said.
- All right.

04:08.866 --> 04:11.005
Hey, go see Dad, yeah?

04:19.142 --> 04:22.249
William Wyatt.

04:22.413 --> 04:26.293
My name is Conrad Sean Lewis.
You will call me Mr. Lewis.

04:26.450 --> 04:28.452
And the uncles, the aunts, the cousins...

04:28.619 --> 04:31.657
the nieces, the nephews
that lived in those walls.

04:31.822 --> 04:35.463
A gibbering pack of tree apes
that said nothing, nothing, nothing...

04:35.626 --> 04:38.072
and said it loud, loud, loud.

04:38.228 --> 04:41.175
Let me be the first
to welcome you to the BCFB.

04:41.732 --> 04:43.609
After you.

04:53.477 --> 04:54.615
There's a new guy.

04:54.778 --> 04:57.315
You're in luck.
You're just in time for dinner.

04:57.481 --> 04:59.688
Table 4, Elvis.

05:20.838 --> 05:22.943
Stand up, new boy.

05:23.107 --> 05:24.643
Stand up.

05:29.313 --> 05:31.452
Were you eyeballing me, new boy?

05:31.615 --> 05:35.062
- I don't know, but I don't think I was, sir.
- Did I say you could talk?

05:35.219 --> 05:38.393
- Well, you kind of implied permission, sir.
- What?

05:38.555 --> 05:40.865
The implication was that
you wanted an answer.

05:41.024 --> 05:44.938
When I want an answer,
I will tell you, understood?!

05:45.095 --> 05:46.768
I just asked you a question, new boy!

05:46.930 --> 05:50.002
Certainly even you, sir, can see
how confusing this is becoming.

05:53.670 --> 05:55.445
Chill, chill, chill.

05:56.206 --> 05:59.585
- Lucky.
- You've been here exactly five minutes.

06:00.811 --> 06:05.123
That's an impressive beginning and
an ominous portent of things to come.

06:06.316 --> 06:10.162
My name is Montgomery De La Cruz,
the director at the Bernville Camp for Boys.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.102
I wanna welcome you.
I know it might seem hollow...

06:14.258 --> 06:17.796
because there's got to be
some other place you'd rather be.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.167
Isn't there?

06:23.734 --> 06:27.238
- I'm waiting.
- Some other place I'd rather be...

06:27.404 --> 06:30.351
- Some places, sure.
- A simple yes or no will suffice.

06:30.507 --> 06:32.009
- Yes.
- Thank you.

06:32.976 --> 06:36.685
But you didn't do very well in those other
places you'd rather be, now, did you?

06:36.847 --> 06:41.694
That's hard to say, sir. I haven't actually
been to some of the places I'd rather be.

06:42.019 --> 06:44.158
Tough guy over here.

06:50.394 --> 06:52.135
Come with me.

06:53.964 --> 06:56.740
What made him think he can
get away with this?

06:57.501 --> 07:00.744
- Get out of here, man.
- Eat in silence.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.556
Now, Mr. Wyatt, you and I are
gonna engage in witty byplay...

07:10.714 --> 07:13.354
but perhaps when you have
a tad less energy...

07:13.517 --> 07:15.622
and not in front
of the general population.

07:15.786 --> 07:17.891
Do we understand each other?

07:18.055 --> 07:20.035
I doubt it, sir.

07:20.224 --> 07:22.500
You're a very clever boy, Billy.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.003
We don't get a lot of clever boys here.

07:25.162 --> 07:28.507
I imagine you're gonna be
a very refreshing challenge.

07:28.665 --> 07:31.202
But be careful. I think it was
Albert Camus who said...

07:31.368 --> 07:34.440
that a man can hang himself
with too much cleverness.

07:35.806 --> 07:39.413
- Yes, sir. Yeah.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

07:41.178 --> 07:45.388
Actually, it wasn't Camus who said that.

07:47.184 --> 07:49.221
It was Billy the Kid.

07:49.820 --> 07:51.493
Good night, sir.

08:07.004 --> 08:09.575
Hey, that took some balls, man.

08:15.946 --> 08:17.118
I'm Nathan Stein.

08:18.482 --> 08:19.825
Billy.

08:27.858 --> 08:30.338
- So, what did you do?
- Yeah.

08:30.994 --> 08:35.807
- I burnt my parents' house down.
- Oh, okay.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.936
What about you?

08:39.102 --> 08:43.107
Dope, cars, rock 'n' roll.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.310
Yeah. Dope.

08:49.646 --> 08:51.853
- You all right?
- Oh, shut your mouth.

08:52.149 --> 08:53.628
Yeah.

08:54.585 --> 08:56.292
I'm the sickly one.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.097
- Every institution needs one, right?
- Yeah.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.369
- I read that in the brochure.
- Why don't you faggots kiss...

09:02.526 --> 09:05.063
- ...so we can get some sleep?
- Good night, Billy.

09:14.705 --> 09:17.015
I'm sorry, man. I forgot what you said.

09:17.441 --> 09:19.682
Hey, go see Dad, yeah?

09:20.844 --> 09:22.551
Hey, it's cool, man.

09:23.947 --> 09:27.986
But I'm gonna push you a little bit
for talking to my little sister.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.427
My dad's in the car over there.

09:30.587 --> 09:33.067
You got them all fooled, don't you, man?

09:35.158 --> 09:36.865
Bet your dad's real proud of you.

09:39.363 --> 09:41.138
- Hello, Sweets.
- Hello.

09:41.298 --> 09:44.177
- How are you? How was school?
- It was all right.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.076
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:19.603 --> 10:22.550
Everyone turn to Page 55
where we left off.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.518
Page 55. You guys must have been
at this for months.

10:27.678 --> 10:30.659
- Shut up.
- "With school turning out more runners...

10:30.814 --> 10:35.126
jumpers, racers, tinkerers...

10:35.285 --> 10:38.858
grabbers, snatchers..."

10:39.856 --> 10:43.668
Mr. Wyatt? Your first day, right?

10:44.061 --> 10:46.063
I can get you caught up
if you haven't read this.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.708
Oh, I read it.

10:47.864 --> 10:52.711
Okay. Then it shouldn't be a problem
for you to continue with today's reading.

10:52.869 --> 10:56.248
Please. Bring your book
and come up front.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.317
Gay James Dean.

11:05.949 --> 11:08.429
"Grabbers, snatchers, fliers
and swimmers...

11:08.585 --> 11:12.931
instead of examiners." Critics...

11:13.557 --> 11:17.699
knowers and imaginative creators.

11:18.862 --> 11:21.672
The word "intellectual," of course...

11:21.832 --> 11:25.905
became the swear word it deserved to be.

11:26.236 --> 11:29.080
Class, you may write "shit, yeah"
in the margins.

11:29.239 --> 11:31.116
Enough editorializing, Mr. Wyatt.

11:33.543 --> 11:37.423
You always dread the unfamiliar.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.992
We must all be alike.

11:41.551 --> 11:46.625
Not everyone born free and equal.

11:46.890 --> 11:51.066
- Yeah, because freedom can suck my...
- Mr. Wyatt.

11:51.962 --> 11:55.136
Your knowledge of the book
is impressive, but I'm warning you.

11:56.266 --> 11:58.109
Gentlemen.

12:04.074 --> 12:07.180
When you're ready to take this seriously,
I will welcome you back.

12:07.344 --> 12:08.550
But for now, get out.

12:11.414 --> 12:13.826
- Get out, boy! Get out!
- Yeah!

12:13.984 --> 12:15.657
Get out!

12:16.219 --> 12:19.291
- Oh, no, come back.
- Yeah!

12:20.323 --> 12:24.237
If you all find Mr. Wyatt so amusing, all
of you, get the hell out of my classroom.

12:24.394 --> 12:27.431
Come on, man. We didn't do nothing.
I'm not cleaning up rocks.

12:27.531 --> 12:28.942
I understand this gathering...

12:29.099 --> 12:33.377
comes courtesy
of everyone's favorite funny man.

12:33.537 --> 12:35.881
- Billy Wyatt.
- What's up with this guy?

12:36.039 --> 12:37.074
Now...

12:37.841 --> 12:40.481
here's what you sweethearts are gonna do.

12:41.211 --> 12:44.556
You're gonna move all these rocks
at the bottom...

12:45.182 --> 12:48.095
up there.
They're in my way down here.

12:49.219 --> 12:52.564
Now, I don't know how many rocks
exactly will fit up there...

12:52.722 --> 12:55.760
so it's possible a few
might have to come back down.

12:55.926 --> 12:56.927
But we'll see.

12:57.828 --> 12:59.603
Maybe by then...

12:59.896 --> 13:02.900
- ...Billy won't seem so funny anymore.
- Oh, how's this for funny?

13:03.066 --> 13:07.515
A rabbi, a priest and a hooker...
Hooker... walk into a bar.

13:07.671 --> 13:10.584
Now, the bartender, he's like,
"This is a joke, right?"

13:11.007 --> 13:14.580
Oh, no, no. No.
I know you're out there, Conrad.

13:14.744 --> 13:17.816
- I can smell you breathing.
- Word of advice.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.856
Shut the hell up.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.758
That is four words, technically.

13:25.589 --> 13:27.068
Damn.

13:27.657 --> 13:29.637
- Anybody else?
- Damn.

14:01.057 --> 14:04.038
Hey, let me ask you something.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.135
Ask away.

14:07.464 --> 14:11.844
How'd you do that thing in class?

14:12.269 --> 14:14.715
When you looked up from your book
and kept reading...

14:15.138 --> 14:18.950
- ...like you had it memorized.
- I did, you know. I mean, I do.

14:19.109 --> 14:22.488
I have this memory thing.
Eidetic memory.

14:22.646 --> 14:24.956
I'm supposed to know what that means?

14:25.482 --> 14:28.361
If I read something or see a picture
of something just once...

14:28.518 --> 14:30.862
it sticks with me forever,
with perfect clarity.

14:31.021 --> 14:33.365
- That's awesome.
- Oh, you think so?

14:33.523 --> 14:37.027
How'd you like to have the menu
of IHOP on 23rd and Broadway...

14:37.193 --> 14:39.332
dancing around in your head 24/7?

14:39.963 --> 14:42.842
Got it from my father. He has it.

14:42.999 --> 14:45.605
Bet your dad's pretty pissed
at you now, huh?

14:48.505 --> 14:49.950
Yeah.

14:54.844 --> 14:57.290
Let me ask you something else,
Mr. Memory.

14:57.447 --> 14:59.723
- Yeah?
- What's that Greek myth...

14:59.883 --> 15:02.887
- ...with the guy in... That carries...
- Sisyphus.

15:03.053 --> 15:06.125
- Yeah. He pushed the rock up that hill.
- Great story.

15:06.289 --> 15:09.236
He carries rocks up the hill for 20 years.

15:09.392 --> 15:12.100
He got, as you can imagine,
completely buff.

15:12.262 --> 15:15.072
A Greek princess falls in love with him.
They get married.

15:15.231 --> 15:19.043
He mounts her atop Olympus on
the hourly basis until he dies at 200...

15:19.569 --> 15:22.379
- ...after which, they made him a god.
- Really?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.444
No.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.185
Shit.

15:31.448 --> 15:33.485
Billy, you're bleeding.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.224
On your back.

15:38.955 --> 15:40.957
You fell, funny man.

15:41.391 --> 15:43.302
Go to the infirmary.

15:45.795 --> 15:48.241
I tell you what, Dwayne.

15:48.398 --> 15:51.072
I have a job. So you don't need
to send me those checks...

15:51.234 --> 15:53.441
that you weren't even sending me anyway.

16:03.013 --> 16:06.358
- How long you been sitting there?
- I don't know.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.666
What's wrong with you?

16:13.356 --> 16:17.862
- I got a kind of cut on my back.
- Take off your shirt.

16:18.161 --> 16:22.200
Just like that? Not gonna
ask me out to dinner first?

16:22.599 --> 16:24.545
At least tell me I'm pretty.

16:25.802 --> 16:28.282
- What's your name?
- Billy.

16:28.438 --> 16:31.146
Nurse Simms.
Now, off with that shirt, bright eyes.

16:40.350 --> 16:42.330
Oh, man.

16:43.286 --> 16:44.890
That bad?

16:45.789 --> 16:47.530
What happened?

16:47.690 --> 16:49.363
I fell.

16:51.494 --> 16:53.838
We have a falling epidemic here.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.073
Just gonna clean it.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.776
Do I need stitches?

17:03.740 --> 17:06.482
I don't know. I don't think so.

17:06.643 --> 17:10.021
That's good because I hate needles.

17:11.448 --> 17:12.825
Me too.

17:19.422 --> 17:21.060
Turn around.

17:27.564 --> 17:29.373
Can you breathe okay?

17:29.532 --> 17:32.775
I don't know.
Feels like I broke something.

17:32.936 --> 17:34.745
Rest.

18:31.761 --> 18:36.676
All right, so the black guys
don't talk to the Latino guys.

18:36.833 --> 18:40.371
And the skinheads don't talk to
the black guys or the Latino guys.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.574
And nobody talks to the crackers.

18:42.739 --> 18:45.276
- I love clichés.
- Yeah.

18:45.441 --> 18:48.183
And nobody but nobody talks to me.

18:49.812 --> 18:53.817
I'll talk to you, Nathan.
I'll talk your goddamn ear off.

18:53.983 --> 18:56.429
You're crazier than I thought, man.

18:58.721 --> 19:01.668
See that guy? It's Carlos Fuentes.

19:01.824 --> 19:05.067
- He's the alpha dog, El Gato.
- How can he be the alpha dog...

19:05.228 --> 19:08.141
and called The Cat?
His moniker contradicts his position.

19:08.298 --> 19:10.278
Because he shot a guy. In the eye.

19:10.667 --> 19:13.375
Behind a Five Guys. He shot him
with a burger in his mouth.

19:13.536 --> 19:14.981
Jesus.

19:15.171 --> 19:18.983
- And they put him in here?
- Yeah. Mexican Mafia.

19:19.142 --> 19:22.123
He's totally connected.
That shit is far-reaching.

19:22.278 --> 19:24.485
Some kind of family thing, I think.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.691
You got your pads on all backwards, bro.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.891
- Thanks. Am I good?
- Yeah.

19:32.055 --> 19:33.762
All right.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.940
Yo, Nathan got J.T.'s old helmet.

19:48.238 --> 19:49.717
Make him the waterboy.

19:49.872 --> 19:53.820
All right. For those of you
who just recently joined the team...

19:53.977 --> 19:56.253
my name is Coach Carmichael.

19:56.412 --> 19:59.882
You might remember me from my days
playing linebacker for the Eagles.

20:00.850 --> 20:03.353
All right. Football...

20:03.586 --> 20:06.829
- If he says football is a lot like life...
- Football is a lot like...

20:06.990 --> 20:09.869
- ...I'll barf blood on his cleats.
- A lot like life.

20:12.862 --> 20:14.773
You find something funny, Stein?

20:16.966 --> 20:18.274
No, sir. No.

20:18.434 --> 20:22.007
Since you like to laugh so much,
maybe we crack you up officially.

20:22.171 --> 20:23.172
Dye.

20:23.339 --> 20:26.343
- Yeah, J.T. Show him what's up!
- Here's your tough guy.

20:26.609 --> 20:28.418
- You ball?
- I was defensive end...

20:28.578 --> 20:30.489
back at Erasmus Hall. Yeah.

20:30.647 --> 20:33.685
I broke a dude's collarbone
so I got kicked off the team.

20:33.850 --> 20:35.056
Part of the game.

20:35.718 --> 20:37.891
He was our quarterback, so...

20:38.087 --> 20:39.430
Son, you got Eagle potential.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.867
A little one-on-one.

20:42.358 --> 20:45.965
See if you can blow past Mr. Dye.
Run to daylight, pussy.

20:46.129 --> 20:50.077
Sir, Nathan is a pussy.
He's a international pussy.

20:50.433 --> 20:53.710
He's a real-deal pussy.
I, on the other hand...

20:55.972 --> 20:59.510
- Damn.
- Yo, that's my boy right there.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.747
Get up. Get up, son.

21:03.413 --> 21:05.916
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

21:06.416 --> 21:09.397
- Like a rag doll.
- You want another one?

21:09.552 --> 21:11.930
He just said something nasty
about your mama.

21:12.522 --> 21:15.332
Oh, is that right?

21:18.494 --> 21:20.474
Do it again.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.143
- Down!
- Yeah, J.T.

21:25.301 --> 21:27.440
- What'd you say about my mama?
- Nothing.

21:27.603 --> 21:29.708
But you hit me like that again, I might.

21:29.872 --> 21:32.580
I think I busted something.

21:33.810 --> 21:35.289
Son of a...

21:36.079 --> 21:37.558
Peas from last weekend.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.625
I bet you won't be verbing me no more.

21:39.782 --> 21:44.731
Verbing? Would that be
in the eyeballing family, sir?

21:47.256 --> 21:49.600
- Do it again.
- Come on, man.

21:51.027 --> 21:52.802
Do it, J.T., do it.

21:53.296 --> 21:54.775
Man.

21:59.936 --> 22:02.246
Nah, I guess I wouldn't.

22:06.676 --> 22:09.885
- Again.
- Stay down.

22:16.652 --> 22:17.824
Do it again.

22:22.392 --> 22:23.496
Again.

22:25.995 --> 22:28.339
Do it again. Again.

22:32.135 --> 22:33.546
Straight embarrassing.

22:39.475 --> 22:41.921
This is getting ridiculous now, man.

22:44.714 --> 22:46.455
Do it again.

22:53.823 --> 22:55.700
Oh, man.

22:56.359 --> 22:59.067
- What are you doing?
- He's done. He's done, man.

23:01.164 --> 23:02.643
Hey!

23:03.199 --> 23:04.610
Get back here!

23:15.278 --> 23:16.552
Nice hit, Mr. Dye.

23:23.486 --> 23:27.992
"Why is it," he said, one time
at the subway entrance...

23:28.958 --> 23:31.871
"I feel I've known you
so many years?"

23:32.295 --> 23:36.675
"Because I like you, " she said.
"And I don't want anything from you."

23:47.877 --> 23:49.879
You smell nice.

23:50.413 --> 23:52.324
Like morning.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.095
Don't.

23:58.454 --> 23:59.933
Okay.

24:06.262 --> 24:08.139
Whatever you did...

24:09.232 --> 24:11.439
you're too smart to be in here.

24:12.768 --> 24:14.611
You wanna talk about it?

24:21.811 --> 24:23.950
You have a first name?

24:26.482 --> 24:28.052
I sure do.

24:35.925 --> 24:38.337
You let me know if you change your mind.

25:47.863 --> 25:49.865
Come on.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.829
This one's on the nurse.

26:20.696 --> 26:22.403
Conrad.

26:23.132 --> 26:26.306
You got me the job.
Lord knows I need it.

26:26.469 --> 26:29.916
And I will do it, but I will not do you.

26:31.741 --> 26:34.483
Not again. We've been down
that road before, Connie.

26:35.778 --> 26:40.158
And it was a really short, boring trip.

27:24.093 --> 27:28.599
Hey, Emmit.
Dance with Conrad, will you?

27:28.864 --> 27:32.505
I don't dance.
The last time I danced was with my wife...

27:32.668 --> 27:37.048
and she danced right out the door,
which is where I'm headed.

27:37.273 --> 27:39.253
Y'all have a good night.

27:55.524 --> 27:57.197
Damn.

27:59.662 --> 28:01.699
Take it easy.

28:03.966 --> 28:05.809
Y'all need...

28:07.403 --> 28:09.383
an IHOP.

28:10.172 --> 28:12.743
No, y'all need
to find another place to sit.

28:12.908 --> 28:16.355
That's what I'm saying. Y'all had
an IHOP, I'd be in there having...

28:16.512 --> 28:21.860
the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity.
Instead, I got this.

28:22.451 --> 28:26.900
Bernville, in all its downtown
downtrodden splendor.

28:27.056 --> 28:29.366
Where you need to be at, son?

28:30.426 --> 28:33.896
Don't get all existential on me, officer.

28:34.363 --> 28:37.537
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.270
Where you need to be?

28:40.035 --> 28:43.676
- The Bernville Camp for Boys.
- Get in the car!

28:43.839 --> 28:46.820
- Shotgun.
- In the back, boy.

28:51.013 --> 28:52.651
Let me see if I got this straight.

28:53.115 --> 28:57.188
You broke out of camp tonight
so that I could take you back tonight?

28:57.353 --> 28:59.458
And why, you ask? Well...

28:59.622 --> 29:02.728
why did Sir Edmund Hillary
climb Mount Everest?

29:02.892 --> 29:04.633
Why do dogs lick their balls?

29:04.794 --> 29:07.832
Why did Sir Edmund lick his balls
at the summit?

29:09.031 --> 29:11.705
So, what did you do
to land yourself in there?

29:13.302 --> 29:15.009
Shot a man in Reno.

29:15.838 --> 29:18.978
You're a little too young
to know about Johnny Cash.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.511
My dad taught me.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.554
And what does he do?

29:24.046 --> 29:26.526
Next caller, please.

29:35.124 --> 29:39.630
You may wanna die, but I don't.
Put that smoke out.

29:55.411 --> 29:58.620
I suspect respect
is your biggest problem, son.

29:59.682 --> 30:04.188
And if you lucky,
somebody won't have to beat it into you.

30:04.353 --> 30:06.424
Now, that ain't my style.

30:07.323 --> 30:09.894
But I ain't too old to change.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.971
Get this cleaned up...

30:13.128 --> 30:15.608
and me and you gonna be okay.

30:15.764 --> 30:17.437
Yes, sir.

30:46.896 --> 30:48.705
Let's go, sweetheart.

30:55.971 --> 30:58.713
Compliments of Mr. Wyatt's
late-night outing...

30:58.874 --> 31:02.253
he will be wearing
the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo!

31:02.411 --> 31:06.018
He will wear it today,
tomorrow and for as long as I say!

31:06.181 --> 31:10.459
This is not the only tuxedo
I have in stock, Mr. Dye.

31:10.619 --> 31:13.657
Any one of you even think
about going AWOL, Mr. Stein...

31:13.822 --> 31:17.827
I will outfit all you fish in a flash.

31:20.896 --> 31:23.240
Now, back to your spades.

31:24.233 --> 31:25.837
Spade.

31:31.507 --> 31:33.714
- Look at his eye.
- Hey, yo, chill out.

31:36.679 --> 31:39.353
- Hey, Bill.
- This good? Like this?

31:42.318 --> 31:43.626
Here.

31:46.422 --> 31:48.732
I stole it from breakfast.

31:51.126 --> 31:53.106
What is all this?

31:53.529 --> 31:57.102
It's the community construction program.

31:57.266 --> 31:59.075
I've been here for like two months...

31:59.234 --> 32:01.908
and nobody seems to know
what the hell we're building.

32:03.038 --> 32:06.076
- Coming through, coming through.
- Whose sweet ride?

32:06.575 --> 32:08.350
It's Montgomery's.

32:08.544 --> 32:12.720
It's his pride and joy.
He'd have sex with it if he could.

32:13.382 --> 32:17.159
Maybe I'm giving him too much credit.
Maybe he has.

32:18.754 --> 32:20.665
You better hide that shit.

32:20.823 --> 32:24.498
Hey, if you could have sex with any car,
what kind of car would it be?

32:26.962 --> 32:28.532
Phantom.

32:29.832 --> 32:32.870
But, you know, I'd be thinking
about a Jag so, you know...

32:33.035 --> 32:34.776
Yeah, I know.

32:36.538 --> 32:39.678
The fruit juice of human kindness.

32:41.744 --> 32:44.782
I want you boys to drop down
and give me 50.

32:44.947 --> 32:46.620
Please and thank you very much.

32:51.653 --> 32:53.291
I'm waiting.

32:54.590 --> 32:57.036
I believe you boys
were admiring my automobile?

32:59.094 --> 33:02.439
In the parlance of the street,
she's cherry.

33:02.698 --> 33:07.272
Now, you guys are light years from this,
but we do have a trustee program...

33:07.436 --> 33:11.009
that allows those who get in
the program and stay in the program...

33:11.473 --> 33:14.420
the privilege of working on my car...

33:14.576 --> 33:17.250
and drinking lemonade as the sun sets.

33:17.413 --> 33:19.290
It's an incentive program, if you will.

33:20.816 --> 33:22.352
Mr. Wyatt, how many is that?

33:23.952 --> 33:25.454
Eight percent.

33:26.055 --> 33:27.466
I want another 50.

33:30.893 --> 33:34.534
Come on, Stein,
I haven't seen you do one good one yet.

33:34.696 --> 33:36.676
Don't make me help you!

33:36.832 --> 33:39.938
- Push with your arms!
- I can't.

33:40.102 --> 33:43.447
Push! Give me one fucking good one!

33:44.540 --> 33:47.680
Push! Come on, you weakling.

33:47.843 --> 33:50.483
One fucking push-up. Two...

33:50.646 --> 33:54.890
three, four. You waste of space.

33:55.184 --> 34:00.133
Push! All day! We'll do this all day!

34:06.328 --> 34:11.539
"'Everyone must leave something behind
when he dies,' my grandfather said.

34:13.202 --> 34:18.311
A child, or a book, or a painting...

34:19.074 --> 34:21.815
or a house, or a wall built...

34:22.643 --> 34:25.090
or a pair of shoes made...

34:25.914 --> 34:29.123
or a garden planted." Boys...

34:30.351 --> 34:32.628
unless you wanna join him...

34:40.728 --> 34:42.800
"Something your hand touched some way...

34:42.965 --> 34:46.344
so your soul has somewhere to go
when you die.

34:47.536 --> 34:52.542
And when people look at that tree
or that flower you planted...

34:55.177 --> 34:56.850
you're there."

35:04.319 --> 35:09.098
Oh, wow, if it's Bernville,
and it's autumn and it's after 6...

35:09.258 --> 35:15.539
don't be caught dead without
the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo.

35:15.697 --> 35:21.045
Made from the finest Dacron in Akron,
rubber capital of the world.

35:21.203 --> 35:27.017
It is smart, dashing and now,
the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo.

35:27.176 --> 35:30.680
If you gotta be bad, but you wanna
look good, this is the tux for you...

35:30.846 --> 35:33.918
and you, and you and you.

35:34.082 --> 35:38.462
It comes in a rainbow of colors,
red, yellow, tan and brown.

35:38.620 --> 35:41.191
The Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo!

35:41.356 --> 35:45.862
It is a veritable clusterfuck of a tux.

35:52.234 --> 35:54.510
Any takers? Five ninety-nine.

35:54.670 --> 35:57.810
It's 7.99 at Walmart.
What about you fellas over here?

35:57.973 --> 36:02.581
No? No takers? You guys over here?
Rainbow of colors. Rainbow.

36:07.182 --> 36:08.718
Jeez.

36:08.884 --> 36:11.797
- You can't sit here, man.
- I can't and...

36:13.822 --> 36:15.324
And yet I am.

36:15.490 --> 36:17.299
I just wanna say thanks, man.

36:17.726 --> 36:20.798
For what, carrying your weak ass
to the Infirmary?

36:20.963 --> 36:24.035
No, no, no. This morning at the site,
you came to check on me.

36:24.199 --> 36:25.200
What?

36:25.367 --> 36:28.940
You were checking on my well-being
after my night out. It was very Oprah.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.050
Seven-thirty, just spew this shit out.

36:31.206 --> 36:34.016
I'm a vessel. This shit just comes to me
from the universe.

36:34.176 --> 36:37.521
I put it back out there.
I'm a channeler. I see things.

36:37.679 --> 36:39.886
- It's what I do. Hold on.
- Believe this shit?

36:40.048 --> 36:43.291
I'm pretending I'm Christ
trying to get the waiter back at my table...

36:43.452 --> 36:46.990
at the Last Supper.
I just found a fly in my fish.

36:47.422 --> 36:49.060
- CVS.
- CVS what?

36:49.224 --> 36:53.434
"CVS what?" "CVS wh..."
CVS, man, the drugstore chain.

36:53.595 --> 36:55.404
You're a regional manager by 40.

36:55.564 --> 36:58.135
Yeah, you'll train somewhere
in northern Virginia...

36:58.300 --> 37:02.373
but you end up back in Pennsylvania.
Three perfect kids, a beautiful wife.

37:02.537 --> 37:06.679
You'll be living on Philly Main Line
adjacent and driving a Jag.

37:06.842 --> 37:08.913
Doing your best not to bang it.

37:09.077 --> 37:11.557
You're just begging to get beat,
you know that?

37:11.713 --> 37:13.715
That's bullshit, man.

37:16.351 --> 37:18.294
Six Flags! Six Flags!

37:20.889 --> 37:23.335
We need not to be let alone.

37:23.492 --> 37:27.099
We need to be really bothered
once in a while.

37:27.629 --> 37:32.669
How long is it since you were really
bothered about something important?

37:34.136 --> 37:36.082
About something real.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.942
Ray, you are the shit.

37:41.410 --> 37:44.016
- Get up and get out of that.
- Where am I going?

37:44.179 --> 37:45.852
- You got a visitor.
- Forget it.

37:46.014 --> 37:49.928
I can't. You ought to see her,
true piece.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.693
I don't have all day, Wyatt.

38:03.165 --> 38:04.542
Mrs. Wyatt.

38:04.966 --> 38:06.070
Billy.

38:06.401 --> 38:09.348
Permission to return to population, sir?

38:09.805 --> 38:11.580
- Sit down, son.
- Go to hell.

38:11.740 --> 38:13.276
Okay, I'm gonna sit.

38:13.442 --> 38:16.787
Will you get your hands off me?
Okay, okay!

38:16.945 --> 38:19.357
There. Yeah, thank you!

38:21.016 --> 38:24.589
Billy, I just... I've...
I've been thinking about you.

38:24.753 --> 38:29.463
I just wanted to know
if you were okay, and I drove...

38:29.624 --> 38:31.900
Nobody asked you to.

38:41.470 --> 38:43.381
Is everything all right?

38:43.538 --> 38:47.111
- I just wanted to see my son.
- Permission to return to population, sir.

38:47.275 --> 38:49.915
Jesus Christ, Billy,
please stop staying that.

38:50.078 --> 38:53.287
I know, I know I've made mistakes, but...

38:53.448 --> 38:58.625
- Permission to return to population!
- Okay, all right, Billy. Come with me.

38:59.354 --> 39:01.891
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wyatt.
Just give me a minute.

39:04.993 --> 39:06.802
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

39:06.962 --> 39:09.533
- So, what's the story?
- There's no story.

39:09.698 --> 39:12.304
- Yeah, but she's your mother.
- That's not my fault.

39:13.168 --> 39:14.772
So you won't talk to her?

39:14.936 --> 39:17.644
- No, I'm not gonna talk to her.
- Here you go, ma'am.

39:17.806 --> 39:21.515
You can throw me back in there,
but you cannot open my eyes.

39:21.676 --> 39:23.917
Maybe not this time.

39:24.846 --> 39:27.190
What do you want me to do,
want me to handle it?

39:27.883 --> 39:31.228
Yeah. Please.

39:34.156 --> 39:36.727
- All right. All right, man.
- Pl... Thank you.

39:45.634 --> 39:47.705
- Mrs. Wyatt.
- Yes.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.649
I'm sorry, he just...

39:53.809 --> 39:57.689
- He just doesn't wanna talk to you.
- No, no, I'm sorry.

39:57.846 --> 40:00.019
Sometimes these boys
need extra time to adjust.

40:00.182 --> 40:04.096
- You can't blame yourself for it.
- I know.

40:05.887 --> 40:08.197
Okay, I should go.

40:08.457 --> 40:09.697
Sorry.

40:10.492 --> 40:12.631
I'll walk you to the car.

40:14.129 --> 40:16.541
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

40:22.971 --> 40:24.973
Let's go, Mr. Wyatt.

41:14.789 --> 41:18.100
Does Conrad know about this place?

41:18.260 --> 41:19.762
Yeah.

41:19.995 --> 41:22.339
And he's cool with it?

41:24.399 --> 41:29.906
Yeah. Conrad's an idiot,
but he ain't stupid.

41:30.305 --> 41:34.447
He knows outside this place
there's more of me than him.

41:35.210 --> 41:37.986
So Conrad makes allowances.

41:43.351 --> 41:47.993
Conrad, Carnalito, is a pussy.

41:49.157 --> 41:51.797
He's a pussy for you, El Gato.

41:52.160 --> 41:56.040
For Guillermo, he's a pussy with a whip.

41:56.765 --> 41:59.837
That douchebag's liable to bury me.

42:00.235 --> 42:02.772
Isn't that what you want, Guillermo?

42:05.574 --> 42:09.147
What are you, high?

42:09.311 --> 42:10.881
Yeah.

42:11.580 --> 42:13.560
But I'm right.

42:14.783 --> 42:17.320
Why you wanna die so bad?

42:19.254 --> 42:21.200
What did you do?

42:22.457 --> 42:24.061
Nothing.

42:25.894 --> 42:28.966
Man, you come in here
taunting the bull, man...

42:29.130 --> 42:32.873
in the center of the ring.
Calling Conrad out on his shit.

42:34.869 --> 42:36.940
Going head to head with J.T.

42:37.105 --> 42:39.051
- Jesus, man.
- Messing with De La Cruz.

42:39.207 --> 42:43.849
- What is this shit?
- De La Cruz, man, El Diablo.

42:44.012 --> 42:46.219
I don't know about Montgomery anymore.

42:46.381 --> 42:48.383
That's the devil's greatest trick.

42:51.886 --> 42:56.562
What you doing in here, Billy? You best
let that shit out before it eats you alive.

42:59.194 --> 43:01.299
What did you do, Billy?

43:02.731 --> 43:04.574
I gotta know.

43:07.369 --> 43:09.815
My mother was here today.

43:13.008 --> 43:15.352
I can't even look at her.

43:43.538 --> 43:45.916
How do you ever go home?

43:54.215 --> 43:55.626
Fuck!

44:01.623 --> 44:04.399
Hey, hey. Don't.

44:40.795 --> 44:43.036
Oh, man.

44:43.198 --> 44:44.768
What the hell, Billy?

44:44.933 --> 44:47.140
Good evening, Sheriff Till.

44:47.302 --> 44:48.610
Get in the car, Billy.

44:48.770 --> 44:51.410
Yeah, see you around, officer.

44:51.573 --> 44:53.109
Sheriff Till?

44:53.274 --> 44:55.948
When you're done there,
we need you back at the station.

44:56.111 --> 44:58.421
You know what I think, Billy?

44:59.147 --> 45:02.890
Any father who teaches his kid
about Johnny Cash...

45:03.051 --> 45:05.053
- ...things ain't so bad.
- You know what?

45:05.220 --> 45:08.201
You do not talk to me
about my father, okay?

45:08.356 --> 45:11.098
And you don't talk about me.
You don't know me.

45:11.259 --> 45:14.399
Well, you talk to me
like a gentleman, Billy...

45:14.662 --> 45:18.906
or you shut the hell up.
Come on, Billy.

45:23.338 --> 45:26.148
I don't belong in there, man.

45:26.307 --> 45:29.982
Things happened that shouldn't
have happened. They just...

45:30.145 --> 45:31.624
- ...kept happening.
- What things?

45:31.780 --> 45:35.057
Oh, come on. Why does everybody
wanna know all of a sudden?

45:36.284 --> 45:39.993
Because they figure
it's written all over your face.

45:43.057 --> 45:45.628
I can't say it. I don't...
What do you want me to say?

45:45.794 --> 45:47.796
I don't know what to say.

45:54.769 --> 45:57.750
- Fair enough.
- Yeah.

45:57.906 --> 46:01.080
Yeah, I'm messed up here, officer.

46:01.242 --> 46:04.189
Come on, Billy, stop. Billy. Shit!

46:05.313 --> 46:07.793
- No, no, no. Come on, just let me go.
- Come on.

46:07.949 --> 46:10.623
Look, what are you doing?
No. What...?

46:10.785 --> 46:15.131
Come on, Billy. Come on,
calm down. Come on.

46:15.290 --> 46:17.668
Come on, man. No one's gonna care.

46:17.826 --> 46:19.635
Come on, Billy.

46:20.628 --> 46:21.663
Let me go!

46:22.897 --> 46:24.706
I still gotta take you back, Billy.

46:24.866 --> 46:27.244
You don't know what goes on in that place.

46:27.402 --> 46:28.403
Sure I do.

46:28.570 --> 46:33.315
No, you think you know the Bernville
Camp for Boys, but you don't, man.

46:35.109 --> 46:37.055
Life is the Bernville Camp for Boys.

46:37.212 --> 46:41.126
Oh, Jesus Christ. If you're winding up
for the heavy meaning-of-life pitch...

46:41.282 --> 46:45.128
- ...you'll have to do better than that.
- Know what? Shut up and listen to me.

46:45.286 --> 46:46.287
Yes, sir.

46:46.921 --> 46:50.596
- All right?
- Yes, sir. I'll shut up and listen to you.

46:51.059 --> 46:54.097
High school is
the Bernville Camp for Boys.

46:54.629 --> 46:58.202
Afghanistan? The desert version.

46:58.766 --> 47:02.714
The police academy
was the Bernville Camp for Boys.

47:02.871 --> 47:05.579
Hell, my marriage was a lot like that.

47:06.241 --> 47:09.450
The whole world
is a Bernville Camp for Boys, Billy...

47:09.611 --> 47:11.420
and the only way out is through.

47:12.513 --> 47:14.493
That's bullshit.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.893
The only way out is to not get in.

47:18.052 --> 47:22.728
Well, you've managed to get yourself in,
and I've gotta take you back.

47:22.891 --> 47:24.962
- I know.
- Yeah.

47:25.994 --> 47:28.372
Can I ask you something?

47:30.698 --> 47:31.802
What?

47:32.700 --> 47:34.873
You gonna finish that?

47:42.477 --> 47:45.481
Stay down, Billy. Stay down.

48:05.566 --> 48:07.204
This is it.

48:08.136 --> 48:09.479
Home sweet home.

48:09.637 --> 48:12.709
- Take care of yourself, kid.
- Yeah. See you soon.

48:13.474 --> 48:15.351
I'm pretty sure you will.

48:28.389 --> 48:31.768
I feel like I'm shitting a river of fire.

48:31.926 --> 48:34.770
Nathan, man, why don't you let me
take you to the infirmary?

48:34.929 --> 48:37.500
I got juice. I could hook you up
with a bed with a view.

48:37.665 --> 48:41.203
Because the first time I complained,
Conrad said that I was faking...

48:41.369 --> 48:44.179
and that if I bitched again,
I wouldn't be faking anymore.

48:44.339 --> 48:47.286
Yeah, but I could talk to Nurse Simms.
She'll listen to me.

48:47.442 --> 48:50.286
Nurse Simms? You mean
Mother Teresa on animal tranqs?

48:50.445 --> 48:52.015
Oh, yeah, I know...

48:55.283 --> 48:57.263
I told you, Stein.

48:57.418 --> 49:02.197
You shit twice a day, morning and night.

49:02.357 --> 49:05.270
Sometimes these things
are beyond our control, Conrad.

49:05.426 --> 49:09.340
Out! You pull up those pants
and get out of here right now!

49:09.697 --> 49:12.701
I can't. It won't... It won't stop.

49:12.867 --> 49:15.507
You slam that sphincter shut
and get on your feet...

49:15.670 --> 49:18.708
or I will kick you so hard,
you'll shit from your eyes!

49:18.873 --> 49:22.878
- An image you could've kept to yourself.
- Get that goddamn bucket!

49:23.044 --> 49:25.718
Give me that bucket, Wyatt!

49:27.682 --> 49:28.956
Damn it, Conrad!

49:30.051 --> 49:33.521
You shit off my schedule,
you will shit in my bucket!

49:34.255 --> 49:35.928
- Conrad!
- Please.

49:36.090 --> 49:39.401
Not to pull focus from Nathan here,
but let me ask you something.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.801
In your trailer,
how do you live with yourself?

49:41.963 --> 49:44.443
- You shut your mouth.
- For example...

49:44.665 --> 49:48.670
at night, after you've tried to throw
a jack, but you can't get it up...

49:48.836 --> 49:50.941
- ...and the loneliness settles in.
- Shut up.

49:51.105 --> 49:54.678
You realize you're nothing but
a Cro-Magnon fleck of worthlessness...

49:54.842 --> 49:58.790
who can only get his nut off
by watching a sick kid shit in a bucket.

49:58.946 --> 50:00.755
How do you live with yourself, Connie?

50:02.683 --> 50:05.994
You shit in that bucket!
This bucket is your friend, faggot!

50:06.154 --> 50:10.193
You will take this bucket
with you wherever you go!

50:46.727 --> 50:49.435
Permission to use the laundry room, sir?

50:54.702 --> 50:56.181
Thank you.

51:35.042 --> 51:37.579
Stop! Stop!

51:37.745 --> 51:39.486
Get off of me. Stop!

51:39.647 --> 51:40.682
Stop.

51:47.255 --> 51:49.201
You and me, Jew lover.

51:54.795 --> 51:56.604
Kick off, man.

52:09.911 --> 52:12.915
Relax. Boys will be boys.

52:37.071 --> 52:40.712
Carlos, thanks for
having my back last night.

52:44.478 --> 52:47.288
What are you gonna do
when you get out of here?

52:47.815 --> 52:49.852
Get thrown back in.

52:51.452 --> 52:53.295
But not here though.

52:53.454 --> 52:55.957
In with the big boys.

52:56.123 --> 52:58.103
It's cool though.

52:58.259 --> 53:00.398
Top of the heap, you know?

53:01.462 --> 53:02.907
Okay.

53:04.765 --> 53:07.143
Let's say fate was kind.

53:08.936 --> 53:12.850
Okay. Fate's a fucking magician.

53:15.376 --> 53:18.619
I'm gonna feel the wind in my face...

53:19.680 --> 53:23.253
and the silk of thighs
wrapped around my neck...

53:23.417 --> 53:26.193
like the wings of angels.

53:38.599 --> 53:40.203
You...

53:41.002 --> 53:44.472
are no longer El Gato.

53:46.907 --> 53:49.979
You are now El Poeta.

53:50.645 --> 53:53.489
I see you, El Poeta...

53:54.315 --> 53:58.695
in San Francisco in a Kinko's.

53:58.853 --> 54:01.129
Yeah. That's your day job.

54:01.622 --> 54:05.798
But at night, en la noche...

54:05.960 --> 54:08.998
you're reading your poetry
at Papalote's...

54:09.163 --> 54:11.507
while the chicks from Marin...

54:14.168 --> 54:18.344
they're swallowing your yarn.
You're getting more kitty than a vet.

54:23.711 --> 54:25.850
Take me with you.

54:30.418 --> 54:35.367
We cannot tell the precise moment
when friendship is formed.

54:35.523 --> 54:38.367
As in filling a vessel drop by drop...

54:38.726 --> 54:42.003
there's at last a drop
which makes it run over.

54:42.163 --> 54:44.074
So in a series of kindnesses...

54:44.699 --> 54:49.170
there is at last one,
which makes the heart run over.

54:52.873 --> 54:55.513
Nathan, what are you doing?

54:56.243 --> 54:58.416
I'm having the perfect dream.

54:59.580 --> 55:03.756
I'm 7 in Michigan. Genesee County.

55:05.619 --> 55:09.692
And I'm with my parents at this place.

55:10.624 --> 55:13.127
I think it's called something like...

55:14.495 --> 55:18.033
the Miracle Twin Drive-In
or something.

55:18.933 --> 55:22.506
And I'm in my pajamas
in the backseat of the car.

55:22.670 --> 55:27.346
And I'm in that state where
I'm not really asleep.

55:27.508 --> 55:29.681
I'm not fully awake.

55:31.479 --> 55:32.981
And...

55:33.914 --> 55:38.192
next thing I know, I wake up
and it's morning, and I'm in my bed.

55:39.954 --> 55:42.298
I have no idea how I got there.

55:44.425 --> 55:47.872
And next door, I can hear
our neighbor cutting the grass.

55:54.101 --> 55:55.978
Nathan...

56:01.142 --> 56:04.146
why'd you burn your parents' house down?

56:08.149 --> 56:11.392
There was some bad shit
happening with my sister.

56:30.371 --> 56:32.214
My father would...

56:33.340 --> 56:34.614
He'd do stuff to her.

56:37.678 --> 56:40.056
And my mom wouldn't believe her.

56:41.415 --> 56:44.396
So I stole all my mom's jewelry...

56:44.552 --> 56:47.829
and sold it and gave the money
to my sister.

56:47.988 --> 56:50.025
And she took off.

56:50.891 --> 56:53.701
And I couldn't go back.

56:54.228 --> 56:56.731
So I burned their house down.

56:57.465 --> 57:00.241
Figured it would be
a nice goodbye present.

57:05.739 --> 57:07.241
I'm sorry.

57:09.777 --> 57:11.518
You got a sister, Billy?

57:15.983 --> 57:17.462
No.

57:17.918 --> 57:21.127
Hey, I didn't...
I didn't burn it down all the way.

57:22.490 --> 57:24.470
I just kind of...

57:42.576 --> 57:44.988
This would be a weird place to die.

57:46.814 --> 57:48.555
Don't you think?

57:56.824 --> 57:59.361
Mags, what are your
five favorite movies, right?

57:59.527 --> 58:02.565
And do not say Twilight in this car.

58:03.497 --> 58:05.101
Fine.

58:05.266 --> 58:06.643
Remember Me.

58:06.800 --> 58:08.438
The Runaways.

58:08.602 --> 58:10.479
Water for Elephants.

58:10.638 --> 58:11.742
Valentine's Day.

58:11.906 --> 58:15.513
And the fifth would have been
Snow White and the Huntsman.

58:15.676 --> 58:18.486
- But we all know what happened...
- Touché. Touché.

58:20.948 --> 58:23.622
- Ask me my five favorite films.
- Where's this coming from?

58:23.784 --> 58:26.594
It's what I was thinking about in Trig.
Number one, Scarface.

58:26.754 --> 58:29.428
Two, Godfather I and II,
which I count as one.

58:29.590 --> 58:32.503
Three, Bronx Tale. Four, 8 Mile.

58:32.660 --> 58:34.662
Five, Boyz n the Hood.

58:35.729 --> 58:37.299
You know you're white, right?

58:40.267 --> 58:42.907
Oh, don't, no. Oh, I love, yes.

58:43.070 --> 58:44.640
Oh, come on.

58:55.449 --> 58:57.451
I'm sure you know
what you're talking about.

59:14.001 --> 59:16.709
You know, Nathan,
you really look like shit.

59:23.944 --> 59:26.151
Gentlemen, please. Gentlemen.

59:28.148 --> 59:33.860
It has come to my attention that this
year's community construction project...

59:34.021 --> 59:37.298
has, shall we say, stagnated.

59:37.691 --> 59:39.693
What the hell was it
supposed to be anyway?

59:39.860 --> 59:40.998
I have no idea.

59:41.161 --> 59:45.576
This was supposed to be something
created by you as a group.

59:45.733 --> 59:48.373
Something of lasting value.

59:48.535 --> 59:51.209
- He'll say "future generations."
- Something for posterity.

59:51.372 --> 59:53.147
I'm slipping.

59:53.474 --> 59:55.647
Groups of the past
have chosen to construct...

59:55.809 --> 01:00:00.758
a large double-truck recycling bin for
the St. Thomas Fundamentalist Church.

01:00:00.914 --> 01:00:04.293
We've had a backstop for
the Will Stevens Memorial softball field...

01:00:04.451 --> 01:00:05.828
over at Redding.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:10.165
And my favorite,
from the fall of '09 population...

01:00:10.324 --> 01:00:14.704
a pair of oak picnic tables
with matching benches...

01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:16.864
for the Pennsylvania Lenape.

01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.533
Now, I don't know.

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:21.737
Maybe this year's project
of the outdoor chapel...

01:00:21.902 --> 01:00:22.903
"Outdoor chapel"?

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:25.607
...has just not been
as inspiring as I'd hoped it'd be.

01:00:25.773 --> 01:00:30.586
But never in the history
of the Bernville Camp for Boys...

01:00:30.744 --> 01:00:33.452
have we not completed a project.

01:00:34.648 --> 01:00:37.288
Now, I am more than open
to hearing suggestions...

01:00:37.451 --> 01:00:41.763
as to how we might gain
some inspiration in moving this forward.

01:00:41.922 --> 01:00:44.266
And you may discuss this
amongst yourselves.

01:00:44.425 --> 01:00:46.098
But make no mistake...

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.567
this project will be completed by you
one way or another.

01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:53.776
So get on it, gentlemen.

01:00:54.034 --> 01:00:56.071
You have two weeks.

01:00:58.906 --> 01:01:02.149
Sir. Sir. Sir.

01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:05.153
We know right now.
We know exactly what we wanna build.

01:01:05.312 --> 01:01:07.451
- We do?
- We do.

01:01:07.614 --> 01:01:11.994
Sir, in the spirit of the Bernville Camp
for Boys' outdoor chapel...

01:01:12.152 --> 01:01:15.622
I'm picking up a transcendental vibe
from the entire group.

01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:19.828
And I feel more than confident in saying
we'd like to jump the tracks, if you will...

01:01:19.993 --> 01:01:24.442
and build right here on the premises,
for posterity and future generations...

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:27.442
our very own drive-in movie theater.

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:31.541
Yes, but Mr. Wyatt...
That's very interesting.

01:01:31.705 --> 01:01:34.345
But we don't have cars here,
so what would be the point?

01:01:34.508 --> 01:01:38.888
Okay, no cars, right. Literal crowd.
But, come on, I mean...

01:01:39.046 --> 01:01:43.859
Well, can we give it up and let go for the
Bernville Camp for Boys movie theater?

01:01:44.017 --> 01:01:45.894
- Come on now!
- Yeah!

01:01:46.053 --> 01:01:50.160
Come on, who's got the spirit today,
boys? I got the spirit today!

01:01:50.324 --> 01:01:52.099
- Can I get an "amen"?
- Amen.

01:01:52.259 --> 01:01:54.136
- Can I get a "hallelujah"?
- Hallelujah.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:57.639
That's right, boys! Give it up!

01:02:00.167 --> 01:02:02.044
I'm talking about our very own...

01:02:02.202 --> 01:02:04.113
nostalgia-laden, kickass...

01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:06.615
blast from the past, customized...

01:02:06.774 --> 01:02:08.879
glamorized, actual-sized!

01:02:09.042 --> 01:02:13.787
Give it up, hermanos, and brothers
and Fourth Reichians! Give it up!

01:02:14.515 --> 01:02:16.017
Give it up!

01:02:16.183 --> 01:02:17.457
- Amen!
- Amen!

01:02:17.618 --> 01:02:19.359
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.056
- Amen!
- Amen!

01:02:21.221 --> 01:02:24.100
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

01:02:25.159 --> 01:02:27.571
That was a terrific speech, Billy.

01:02:27.728 --> 01:02:30.641
Terrific. Tell you what I'm gonna do.

01:02:30.798 --> 01:02:35.008
You boys build it, and I'm gonna find us
a projection system. How about that?

01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:38.180
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:45.755
That was...

01:02:45.913 --> 01:02:48.018
That was really wonderful, Billy.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:51.852
It was really, really inspiring.

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:07.435
Can I get an "amen"
one more time, brothers?

01:03:07.601 --> 01:03:09.510
Hallelujah!

01:03:11.939 --> 01:03:14.215
- So now what, valiente?
- What?

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:16.786
What you mean, "what?"
This is your damn idea, fool.

01:03:16.944 --> 01:03:22.223
Yeah, exactly. I brought the idea.
I'm the genesis. I'm...

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:26.455
I'm the well from which
the idea for the theater sprung.

01:03:27.688 --> 01:03:31.602
Beyond that, I have nothing.
I have no actual skills.

01:03:31.758 --> 01:03:33.294
Wait, we know how.

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.064
Earl knows.

01:03:37.998 --> 01:03:39.841
Go ahead, man. Tell him.

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:45.076
- Don't be putting your hands on me.
- Yeah, well, then come on, bitch!

01:03:45.239 --> 01:03:47.651
- What's up?
- Jesus Christ.

01:03:48.375 --> 01:03:51.083
It's for the movie theater, damn it.

01:03:51.245 --> 01:03:53.452
J.T., chill.

01:03:53.614 --> 01:03:55.525
Just bend over.

01:03:55.682 --> 01:03:58.060
Or tilt. At least tilt.

01:03:58.218 --> 01:03:59.959
Can I just...? Just a tilt.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.724
Thank you.

01:04:07.661 --> 01:04:08.696
Holy shit.

01:04:08.862 --> 01:04:11.206
It's a pretty simple design.

01:04:11.665 --> 01:04:15.772
My grandfather designed a bunch
of drive-ins before they shot his ass.

01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:17.938
The Circle Drive-In in Scranton?

01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:19.812
That's his.

01:04:20.474 --> 01:04:24.320
- I got blown there once. Or twice.
- Yeah, right.

01:04:24.478 --> 01:04:28.187
That's a lovely visual.
Earl, just continue.

01:04:28.348 --> 01:04:32.990
Need about 12 sheets of
one-inch thick marine-grade plywood.

01:04:33.153 --> 01:04:34.325
We have that already.

01:04:34.488 --> 01:04:36.991
About four times as many truss clamps.

01:04:37.157 --> 01:04:41.071
About 24 2-by-6s.
That'd give us our base.

01:04:41.228 --> 01:04:43.834
And about nine 2-by-4s to shore it up.

01:04:43.997 --> 01:04:46.773
Oh, we're gonna need some
laminated acetate for the screen.

01:04:46.934 --> 01:04:48.311
Where are we gonna get that?

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:50.778
Sheets. We could use sheets?

01:04:50.938 --> 01:04:52.542
Yup. Sheets will work.

01:04:52.706 --> 01:04:55.880
Let's go, huh? Sheets will work.
Sheets will work.

01:04:58.045 --> 01:05:00.252
Yo, hold the board straight, bro.

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:03.022
Pass me that hammer.

01:05:06.553 --> 01:05:09.932
Docent, Museum of Tolerance.

01:05:10.891 --> 01:05:12.768
Let me help you with that.

01:05:14.594 --> 01:05:15.800
Dentist.

01:05:15.963 --> 01:05:20.343
- You're not holding it right.
- Head of advertising, foreign air.

01:05:20.734 --> 01:05:22.907
That's looking good, holmes.

01:05:23.637 --> 01:05:25.480
- The top.
- There we go.

01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:31.717
America's Next Top Model winner.

01:05:31.878 --> 01:05:35.519
Yeah, man. Those 2-by-4s
are right there to the left.

01:05:36.116 --> 01:05:38.118
Librarian.

01:05:38.285 --> 01:05:39.764
- Duluth.
- Bring that over here.

01:05:41.922 --> 01:05:43.595
Prison guard.

01:05:52.232 --> 01:05:54.769
Let's get it up, guys.
Come on. Lift it up.

01:05:54.935 --> 01:05:56.414
Lift it up.

01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:58.647
Nice and easy.

01:05:59.172 --> 01:06:01.550
Come on, give it a little...
A little push.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.517
- Come on. You got this.
- There you go.

01:06:03.677 --> 01:06:05.452
Go ahead. Lift. Get it up. Get it up.

01:06:05.612 --> 01:06:08.752
- You got this. You got this. Yeah.
- Easy, easy.

01:06:08.915 --> 01:06:10.656
A little more.

01:06:12.085 --> 01:06:14.361
- Almost.
- Yeah. We got it.

01:06:14.521 --> 01:06:17.331
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

01:06:17.491 --> 01:06:21.496
- Good job, guys. You got it up.
- That looks sexy, baby.

01:06:21.661 --> 01:06:23.607
- What do you think, man?
- It's beautiful.

01:06:23.764 --> 01:06:26.301
- Told you. Told you.
- I know. I didn't doubt you.

01:06:26.466 --> 01:06:28.173
Look at this. Look at this.

01:06:28.335 --> 01:06:30.906
- Look at this.
- Good job, guys.

01:06:42.015 --> 01:06:43.688
Guy's been ducking me for two weeks.

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:45.761
When I see him, I'm gonna break his face.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:47.956
- Do you like him?
- He's a fucking jerk.

01:06:48.121 --> 01:06:51.193
Ten dollars. You got off cheap.
He's out of your life.

01:06:51.358 --> 01:06:54.134
I'm still gonna fucking break his face.

01:07:00.033 --> 01:07:02.445
It ain't Michigan and you're not 7...

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:05.208
but it is pretty cool, ain't it, Nate?

01:07:06.473 --> 01:07:07.781
Yeah.

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:10.319
You knocked it out of the park, Billy.

01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:57.302
This movie thing was your idea?

01:07:57.457 --> 01:08:00.597
Would that I could take sole credit.
I'm simply the humble vessel...

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.104
- Shut up.
- ...from which the idea sprung.

01:08:03.263 --> 01:08:04.401
Shut up.

01:08:04.564 --> 01:08:06.009
Genesis of the idea.

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:08.009
It's Tina.

01:08:09.169 --> 01:08:10.944
My name.

01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:17.216
It's very nice to meet you, Tina.

01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:24.151
This is amazing.

01:08:26.419 --> 01:08:28.729
Mr. Miracle Boy.

01:08:46.139 --> 01:08:48.345
I work here, Billy.

01:08:51.578 --> 01:08:55.287
But I bet neither of us
are gonna be here forever...

01:08:55.982 --> 01:08:57.051
odds are.

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.263
- You go to this school?
- I'm Jane.

01:09:05.325 --> 01:09:08.203
Permission to rejoin the population.

01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:09.930
Granted.

01:09:10.863 --> 01:09:12.502
I just moved here.

01:09:12.666 --> 01:09:14.942
Yeah, because I seen you on the bus
the other day.

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:16.603
And you're...?

01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:18.272
Me, I'm Calogero.

01:09:18.438 --> 01:09:19.781
Ca-who?

01:09:19.939 --> 01:09:21.475
Calogero.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.948
What kind of name is that?

01:09:23.109 --> 01:09:26.750
It's Italian. But actually, it's Sicilian.
My family's from Sicily.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:27.913
Sicily?

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.520
You know where Italy is?
The boot that comes down...

01:09:30.684 --> 01:09:33.665
- I've gotta see her.
- Who?

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:35.555
Tina.

01:09:35.721 --> 01:09:39.169
- Who the hell's Tina?
- Nurse Simms is Tina.

01:09:39.526 --> 01:09:42.404
- Her name is Tina?
- Yeah. Her name...

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:46.372
- That's kind of dirty and awesome.
- Oh, stop.

01:09:46.533 --> 01:09:48.341
I gotta see her, man.

01:09:48.501 --> 01:09:52.210
- Dude, you're dreaming.
- Yeah. I know.

01:09:58.645 --> 01:09:59.988
You okay?

01:10:00.146 --> 01:10:02.285
No. No.

01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:04.725
- Should I get the bucket?
- No. Screw the bucket.

01:10:04.884 --> 01:10:07.262
Oh, it's time for Screw the Bucket.

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.162
I'm your host RuPaul
on this week's edition.

01:10:10.323 --> 01:10:13.167
Shut up, Billy. Not now, man.

01:10:16.363 --> 01:10:17.865
Guard.

01:10:18.031 --> 01:10:19.442
Guard!

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.774
You know, actually,
I think I'm feeling a little better.

01:10:24.904 --> 01:10:27.544
Well, I think you look a little better.

01:10:27.907 --> 01:10:31.650
And that is my informed medical opinion.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:34.985
I'm just a little tired though.

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:38.288
Then I prescribe...

01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:39.862
sleep.

01:11:17.691 --> 01:11:22.106
He came in with bronchitis and an
intestinal infection. It's just getting worse.

01:11:24.097 --> 01:11:26.634
He's a pretty sick kid, Billy.

01:11:28.301 --> 01:11:30.747
Then why isn't he in a hospital?

01:11:32.839 --> 01:11:34.841
I've got orders.

01:11:35.308 --> 01:11:37.117
You're a nurse.

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:40.457
And I'm just learning
to live by the rules.

01:11:41.448 --> 01:11:45.260
Until my shit is straight,
I've gotta do what I'm told.

01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:47.392
Gotcha.

01:11:50.123 --> 01:11:54.299
How long have you been clean
or straight or you know?

01:11:54.461 --> 01:11:56.634
Seven months and 18 days.

01:11:58.264 --> 01:12:00.175
I keep waiting...

01:12:02.469 --> 01:12:06.440
for the hunger to stop.

01:12:06.606 --> 01:12:08.347
I keep waiting...

01:12:09.642 --> 01:12:13.180
to be still.

01:12:13.346 --> 01:12:16.054
I keep waiting like a good girl.

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:25.960
I keep waiting...

01:12:26.126 --> 01:12:29.073
for you to say something.

01:12:39.005 --> 01:12:41.918
Maybe you can't get really found...

01:12:42.509 --> 01:12:45.422
until you get really lost.

01:13:00.794 --> 01:13:02.467
No.

01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:04.765
Please.

01:13:06.599 --> 01:13:08.840
Sorry. That's just too weird.

01:13:11.037 --> 01:13:13.779
I mean, I'm supposed to be a nurse.

01:13:14.441 --> 01:13:16.182
You're supposed to be a kid.

01:13:16.342 --> 01:13:19.152
And that's just...
That's too weird, even for me.

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:21.588
Weird isn't wrong.

01:13:21.915 --> 01:13:23.656
I know. I know.

01:13:23.817 --> 01:13:25.956
Sometimes it's amazing.

01:13:26.119 --> 01:13:29.828
And sometimes it is wrong.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.439
And sometimes it's both.

01:13:37.564 --> 01:13:39.271
Like now?

01:13:41.134 --> 01:13:42.579
Yes.

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:55.018
Neither of us needs
any more weirdness, Billy.

01:13:59.919 --> 01:14:01.796
I'm sorry.

01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:09.401
It's not like I've never
heard "no" before.

01:14:11.564 --> 01:14:14.875
It's not "no." It's... It's "wait."

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:25.588
Good night, Billy. Go to bed.

01:14:31.284 --> 01:14:34.390
God bless you for letting me say "no."

01:14:37.357 --> 01:14:39.701
That's a first for me.

01:15:11.224 --> 01:15:13.602
I got you, I got you.
What would that mean?

01:15:13.927 --> 01:15:15.065
Billy.

01:15:15.228 --> 01:15:17.572
- A word, please.
- Clandestine.

01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:20.472
- That's very funny, Mr. Wyatt.
- Ancillary?

01:15:20.633 --> 01:15:22.112
I'd like to talk to you, please.

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:24.509
What's up, Montay? Montiago.

01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:27.447
Montel Williams. The Full Monty.

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:31.487
You know, your work with the outdoor
theater was really, really impressive.

01:15:31.644 --> 01:15:33.521
I really, really didn't do that much.

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.956
I think you've done
a lot more than you realize.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:37.450
Okay.

01:15:37.617 --> 01:15:39.858
- Is there a tux on my golden horizon?
- No. No.

01:15:40.019 --> 01:15:41.430
But I'm impressed.

01:15:41.588 --> 01:15:45.434
I'm so impressed that
I'm gonna assign you trustee status.

01:15:45.592 --> 01:15:49.335
Does that mean that I get to get out
of this hellhole early? No offense.

01:15:49.495 --> 01:15:52.374
None taken. And not exactly.
Come here.

01:15:52.532 --> 01:15:54.671
I wanna show you something.

01:15:54.834 --> 01:15:56.279
I want you to meet...

01:16:00.673 --> 01:16:02.311
The White Goddess.

01:16:02.909 --> 01:16:07.119
Monty? We have to get you a woman.

01:16:07.614 --> 01:16:11.528
I want you to care for her
like she's truth and beauty on wheels.

01:16:12.852 --> 01:16:14.490
I can do that.

01:16:14.654 --> 01:16:17.601
You know, I employ three
different types of polishes on her...

01:16:17.757 --> 01:16:19.168
throughout the year.

01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:21.601
In the fall, a medium carnauba,
and it's always...

01:16:21.761 --> 01:16:25.299
You always polish in straight lines,
never in circles.

01:16:25.465 --> 01:16:26.500
Straight lines.

01:16:49.756 --> 01:16:53.727
- Well, ain't this some shit?
- Goddamn movie theater.

01:16:53.893 --> 01:16:56.897
- I was the brains.
- We did all the work.

01:16:57.063 --> 01:16:58.633
And he takes all the glory.

01:16:58.798 --> 01:17:01.244
What a setup.

01:17:01.401 --> 01:17:03.005
Come on, man.

01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:05.843
We're back in the cotton field.

01:17:07.173 --> 01:17:09.676
Oh, Nathan, you see your boy?

01:17:09.842 --> 01:17:11.788
Who gonna help you now?

01:17:44.777 --> 01:17:48.054
You seem to be
a bit all over the place here...

01:17:48.214 --> 01:17:50.319
aesthetically speaking.

01:17:52.151 --> 01:17:53.630
What do you really think of me?

01:17:54.787 --> 01:17:57.324
That's like a wife asking her husband
if she looks fat.

01:17:57.490 --> 01:17:59.629
- I'm not going there.
- Come on, please tell me.

01:17:59.792 --> 01:18:01.931
Okay, you look fat.

01:18:05.631 --> 01:18:08.544
You seem to be
on some kind of mission, huh?

01:18:08.701 --> 01:18:10.681
Boy, I'd love to know what that is.

01:18:10.837 --> 01:18:13.909
Hell-bent on saving every boy
here at the camp.

01:18:14.073 --> 01:18:16.917
What with all your speeches
and your prognostications.

01:18:17.076 --> 01:18:19.078
Is that a word?
I don't think that's a word.

01:18:19.245 --> 01:18:22.385
But, you know, you're on a roll.
So carry on, please.

01:18:38.898 --> 01:18:40.172
Open it.

01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:42.939
Why open it? I lived it.

01:18:43.336 --> 01:18:44.679
All right, then.

01:18:45.171 --> 01:18:47.879
Shouldn't be that difficult
refreshing your memory, huh?

01:18:50.343 --> 01:18:53.347
Grand theft auto. Vandalism.

01:18:54.814 --> 01:18:57.761
Dealing mushrooms
and sampling your own wares.

01:18:57.917 --> 01:19:00.261
And you got busted by the police...

01:19:00.419 --> 01:19:04.697
at 4 a.m., naked on a corner
in Riverdale, wow.

01:19:04.857 --> 01:19:09.237
I don't mean to get technical, sir,
but I was wearing socks.

01:19:09.395 --> 01:19:11.466
You think I don't know anything, do you?

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:16.374
Just like anybody
who's ever tried to tell you anything.

01:19:18.571 --> 01:19:20.949
But I'll tell you, I do know one thing.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.183
I know what it's like to lose a father.

01:19:26.946 --> 01:19:30.484
When I was 13 years old,
I found out my father had cancer.

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:35.431
And the next two years,
I just watched him wither away.

01:19:36.622 --> 01:19:41.162
Brought him home from the hospital so
he could spend the last few days with us.

01:19:42.795 --> 01:19:45.401
I remember one morning
I was going to school...

01:19:45.565 --> 01:19:48.546
and I heard the TV on in the living room.

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:51.807
And I thought my father
was just watching The Today Show.

01:19:54.807 --> 01:19:56.684
But he wasn't.

01:19:56.876 --> 01:19:58.947
He wasn't watching anything.

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.893
He was... He had a plastic bag
around his head.

01:20:05.418 --> 01:20:08.297
He decided to beat God to the punch.

01:20:10.223 --> 01:20:13.898
So, you see, I do know
what it's like to lose a father.

01:20:15.461 --> 01:20:18.738
And everything around you
just becomes so stupid.

01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:21.276
Your friends, your teachers.

01:20:21.434 --> 01:20:24.108
And you know what really pisses you off?

01:20:25.071 --> 01:20:27.051
Is everybody's cockiness.

01:20:27.206 --> 01:20:29.743
Thinking that everything
is so important, so dramatic.

01:20:29.909 --> 01:20:32.549
Like everything's gonna last forever.

01:20:37.516 --> 01:20:40.053
The day we buried them...

01:20:40.219 --> 01:20:43.462
I looked across the street
from the cemetery...

01:20:43.623 --> 01:20:46.467
and there was this guy mowing his lawn...

01:20:46.626 --> 01:20:48.936
like nothing had happened.

01:20:49.328 --> 01:20:51.706
And it made me insane.

01:20:53.866 --> 01:20:56.005
Billy, do you know why you're here?

01:20:57.904 --> 01:21:01.408
Not because you dealt drugs
or you... Or you stole a car.

01:21:01.841 --> 01:21:03.377
Please don't.

01:21:03.943 --> 01:21:05.980
Because you need to learn a lesson, Billy.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.953
You need to learn that
no one gets away with anything.

01:21:12.685 --> 01:21:15.723
Not with all your jokes,
and all your charm and all your talk.

01:21:15.888 --> 01:21:18.391
You know, that's just bullshit.

01:21:23.396 --> 01:21:25.433
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:21:25.598 --> 01:21:27.669
- Your Billy's sister, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:21:27.833 --> 01:21:29.710
Have you seen him around?

01:21:31.103 --> 01:21:33.709
- Speak of the devil.
- Ollie.

01:21:34.607 --> 01:21:36.883
Come on, man. I told you, not here.

01:21:37.777 --> 01:21:40.781
- I'm sorry, man, I forgot what you said.
- That's cool, man.

01:21:41.714 --> 01:21:42.886
Why don't you go see Dad?

01:21:43.049 --> 01:21:45.723
Since you came, you've been
begging us to beat you for it.

01:21:45.885 --> 01:21:48.297
But I'm not gonna do that, Billy.

01:21:48.454 --> 01:21:52.925
I'm not. I'm gonna teach you
how to live with it. By admitting it.

01:21:55.695 --> 01:21:57.675
You were at the wheel.

01:21:58.464 --> 01:22:01.843
And if you hadn't been wasting time
with your dealer...

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:04.675
y'all would've made it.

01:22:06.439 --> 01:22:09.386
Oh, don't, no. Oh, I love, yes.

01:22:09.542 --> 01:22:11.852
Oh, come on.

01:22:12.545 --> 01:22:15.082
Let me give you
a little father-son, Billy.

01:22:15.247 --> 01:22:16.817
You're driving in your car...

01:22:16.983 --> 01:22:20.157
you turn on the radio.
Your girl's riding shotgun.

01:22:20.319 --> 01:22:21.798
She's got her hand on your knee.

01:22:21.954 --> 01:22:24.093
Dad, we got a little girl
in the backseat here.

01:22:24.256 --> 01:22:25.963
A song comes on the radio...

01:22:26.125 --> 01:22:28.969
the kind of song makes you
drive until it's over...

01:22:29.128 --> 01:22:30.539
so you crank it up.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:33.700
If she says "turn it down"...

01:22:34.367 --> 01:22:36.074
dump her at the next corner.

01:22:36.235 --> 01:22:38.374
Does Mom ever turn it down?

01:22:38.804 --> 01:22:41.011
Not once.

01:22:45.611 --> 01:22:47.386
What was that thing with the kid there?

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:48.923
Dad, it was nothing.

01:22:51.283 --> 01:22:54.162
Doing the right thing
is never nothing, Billy.

01:23:55.014 --> 01:23:58.894
You can't go back there.
You know what they'll do to you?

01:23:59.051 --> 01:24:03.966
All that's over. From now on,
you just stay at the trustee dorm.

01:24:04.123 --> 01:24:06.797
And the rest of your time here
will be just penance.

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:10.839
Not punishment.
You're too smart for punishment.

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:14.270
But just ripe enough for penance.

01:24:14.433 --> 01:24:15.673
That's why I like you.

01:24:16.001 --> 01:24:18.447
That's why I think you're special.

01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:34.392
Hey, Nathan.

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.524
You know what I think?

01:24:37.389 --> 01:24:39.733
I think your boy Billy
is cruising the Cruz.

01:24:40.426 --> 01:24:42.531
Always thought he was a slammer.

01:24:42.695 --> 01:24:46.199
Him with all his flowery talk
and his reading and shit.

01:24:46.632 --> 01:24:48.305
Blow me, Earl.

01:24:48.467 --> 01:24:50.538
You didn't just say that, Med Baby.

01:24:50.769 --> 01:24:54.307
- What did he say?
- Well, maybe you didn't hear me.

01:24:54.473 --> 01:24:57.420
Blow me.

01:24:57.977 --> 01:24:59.684
Nathan, my man.

01:25:00.579 --> 01:25:03.719
That was a mistake.

01:25:06.285 --> 01:25:08.492
- Earl, leave him alone.
- Yo, chill, man.

01:25:08.654 --> 01:25:11.430
- Yo, Nathan.
- Nathan.

01:25:13.626 --> 01:25:16.232
- He's gonna kill him, yo.
- Yeah.

01:25:20.399 --> 01:25:25.371
- All right, ease up.
- All right, that's enough. Get him up.

01:25:31.777 --> 01:25:35.088
Things don't work out so good
when there's no Billy around.

01:25:35.414 --> 01:25:38.623
I do believe it's time for your fitting.

01:25:39.652 --> 01:25:42.258
Get your bucket. Pick it up.

01:25:42.421 --> 01:25:44.731
Don't you spill that shit on me.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.737
Let's go.

01:26:11.517 --> 01:26:12.552
Hey, Billy.

01:26:12.785 --> 01:26:15.163
Some lemonade would be nice, huh?

01:26:35.374 --> 01:26:37.752
Okay, there's nothing you can do for him.

01:26:38.010 --> 01:26:41.355
And don't waste your time with
some heroic fantasies either, all right?

01:26:41.513 --> 01:26:43.652
Focus on your own salvation.

01:26:59.164 --> 01:27:01.508
Hey, Billy, can you get that?

01:27:06.472 --> 01:27:07.883
Hello.

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.651
Yes.

01:27:10.075 --> 01:27:12.180
Who's calling, please?

01:27:14.346 --> 01:27:15.757
Who?

01:27:17.549 --> 01:27:20.291
These plugs are in
incredible mint condition.

01:27:22.755 --> 01:27:25.998
- Who... Who was that?
- Your father.

01:27:27.226 --> 01:27:29.797
He wanted to know if you were
still playing golf Sunday.

01:27:29.962 --> 01:27:32.966
I was doing this to help you out.
I made a little mistake, but...

01:27:33.932 --> 01:27:35.809
I know these kinds of things?

01:27:36.135 --> 01:27:41.050
My prognostications!

01:27:56.288 --> 01:27:58.666
- Yo, Billy!
- Yo, son!

01:28:03.062 --> 01:28:06.134
Yo, Billy! Yeah!

01:28:06.632 --> 01:28:08.669
- Are you kidding me?
- Yo, my man, you back?

01:28:13.572 --> 01:28:16.143
You know, this...
This dying thing kind of sucks.

01:28:16.308 --> 01:28:19.187
I don't wanna hear that shit.
You are not dying, okay?

01:28:19.345 --> 01:28:20.949
Nobody is dying.

01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:26.359
- Stay up. Stay up, B.
- Yeah.

01:28:31.423 --> 01:28:33.494
- What the hell is going on?
- Tina.

01:28:33.659 --> 01:28:36.230
Help me. Get his head.

01:28:37.029 --> 01:28:38.667
You got him?

01:28:47.039 --> 01:28:49.178
Hey, we have an emergency.

01:28:51.443 --> 01:28:52.922
Please hurry.

01:29:02.054 --> 01:29:05.501
Mr. Wyatt.
Come out of the car immediately.

01:29:05.657 --> 01:29:06.965
Shit!

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:12.174
Mr. Wyatt. Mr. Wyatt,
get out of the car.

01:29:12.331 --> 01:29:14.902
Now, if you come out right now,
no one's gonna get hurt.

01:29:15.067 --> 01:29:18.105
Mr. Stein's gonna be taken care of.
You understand?

01:29:18.537 --> 01:29:20.813
Ain't that some shit?

01:29:20.973 --> 01:29:23.476
Come on, Mr. Fuentes.
I want you to back up right now.

01:29:23.642 --> 01:29:26.282
- I see you, Guillermo.
- Take everybody with you.

01:29:26.445 --> 01:29:29.858
You got this place high up
in the Sangre de Cristo mountains.

01:29:30.015 --> 01:29:32.621
You can't think of the last line
of your fifth novel.

01:29:32.785 --> 01:29:36.062
You got one baby bouncing
on your knee and another on the way.

01:29:36.221 --> 01:29:39.566
Your neighbor's playing his horn.
And it's sunset.

01:29:39.725 --> 01:29:43.104
All around you,
your world is painted red and gold.

01:29:43.262 --> 01:29:47.540
Then it comes to you,
the last line of your novel.

01:29:48.834 --> 01:29:51.678
Tomorrow doesn't have to be yesterday.

01:29:51.837 --> 01:29:53.942
What the hell's going on?
Go ahead, handle it.

01:29:54.106 --> 01:29:56.279
Just do whatever you have to do,
I don't care.

01:29:56.442 --> 01:29:57.614
Just handle it.

01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:08.162
Do it.

01:30:09.855 --> 01:30:11.334
Go ahead, do it.

01:30:12.524 --> 01:30:14.834
Come on, Conrad.
What the hell you doing?

01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:16.973
- I'm not shooting a kid.
- Where you going?

01:30:17.429 --> 01:30:19.807
Come back here, you coward!

01:30:20.032 --> 01:30:21.409
Time to go home, Billy.

01:30:21.567 --> 01:30:25.344
If you go back to your dorms right now,
nothing will happen to you, understand?

01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:26.676
Go, go, go for it. Go.

01:30:27.973 --> 01:30:30.249
- Come on, come on.
- The only way out is through.

01:30:30.409 --> 01:30:32.082
Do it, you crazy motherfucker!

01:30:32.277 --> 01:30:34.917
Wyatt, it's your last chance.

01:30:39.518 --> 01:30:42.021
- Go, Billy!
- Come on.

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:46.260
You guys have to get going now.
Come on, get to it.

01:30:50.128 --> 01:30:51.573
Get them!

01:30:57.903 --> 01:31:02.909
What are you doing? Go get him!
The kid just stole my car!

01:31:10.482 --> 01:31:13.292
Don't ask for guarantees.

01:31:13.485 --> 01:31:15.055
And don't look to be saved...

01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:18.895
in any one thing, person,
machine or library.

01:31:20.792 --> 01:31:23.272
Do your own bit of saving.

01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:28.442
And if you drown, at least die knowing
you were heading for shore.

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:45.127
- I got him. I got it, I got it.
- You got it?

01:31:46.285 --> 01:31:47.958
Hey.

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.122
Hey. Nathan.

01:31:50.289 --> 01:31:53.736
Hey. Don't you die, man, okay?

01:31:53.892 --> 01:31:57.533
You're the first dude
who could stand me in a long time.

01:31:58.697 --> 01:32:00.677
You too, Billy.

01:32:02.401 --> 01:32:04.039
Thank you.

01:32:06.204 --> 01:32:07.239
Billy!

01:32:07.406 --> 01:32:10.012
- Billy!
- Sir, can you step out, please?

01:32:10.175 --> 01:32:11.779
Thank you.

01:32:12.244 --> 01:32:14.451
- Can you hear me? Okay.
- No, he's unconscious.

01:32:14.613 --> 01:32:17.116
He's breathing. Can you pull him out?

01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:21.160
Look out for his head. Grab his legs.

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:26.133
His sister.
Just please try to find his sister.

01:32:27.359 --> 01:32:29.430
Yeah, okay. I'll try.

01:32:40.038 --> 01:32:41.676
People like us...

01:32:42.975 --> 01:32:45.353
we find each other all the time.

01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:02.238
But that's the wonderful thing about man.

01:33:02.394 --> 01:33:06.137
He never gets so discouraged
or disgusted...

01:33:06.298 --> 01:33:09.309
that he gives up doing it
all over again...

01:33:10.435 --> 01:33:15.646
because he knows very well
it is important and worth the doing.

01:33:36.395 --> 01:33:39.069
Billy? What are you doing?

01:33:39.231 --> 01:33:41.575
- It's okay, Mom.
- Why are you here?

01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:45.148
- Why are you here?
- Billy Wyatt?

01:33:45.303 --> 01:33:47.840
Turn around slowly
and put your hands behind your head.

01:33:48.006 --> 01:33:51.283
It's okay, Mom.
I just came home to say I'm sorry.

01:33:51.443 --> 01:33:52.820
It's gonna be okay.

01:33:52.978 --> 01:33:55.959
I am sorry too. I love you.

01:33:56.114 --> 01:33:57.457
I love you too.

01:33:57.616 --> 01:34:00.392
I've waited so long to hear you say that.

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:04.623
- You love me?
- Yeah, I love you.

01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:06.667
You love me.
