00:07.295 --> 00:08.562
MAN 2:
Tell me about it.

00:08.630 --> 00:10.747
D-Did I leave my keys
in the office?

00:10.799 --> 00:12.633
(keys jingling)
No, oh, here we go.

00:12.717 --> 00:14.468
(alarm chirps)

00:20.492 --> 00:23.060
I told Cynthia
I'd be home early.

00:23.111 --> 00:24.778
Ha! I'm lucky;
Karen's out of town.

Hey, what's going on?

Take it.

MALE CALLER: Hello?

00:40.078 --> 00:41.128
Hello?

00:41.212 --> 00:43.464
CALLER: Hello?
David?!

00:43.548 --> 00:45.949
It's Paul.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.284
We've been shot.

00:47.335 --> 00:49.086
DAVID:
What are you talking about?

00:49.137 --> 00:51.088
Tell him, if he
DAVID: Paul, are you still there?

00:51.139 --> 00:53.173
backs out of the deal,
(groans)

00:53.258 --> 00:56.477
I will kill his wife
and children.

00:56.561 --> 00:57.811
He says...

00:57.896 --> 01:00.297
if we back out of the deal,
he's gonna kill...

01:00.348 --> 01:02.483
What are you doing?!
Oh, my God!

01:02.567 --> 01:04.400
DAVID: Paul, what's happening?
That's gasoline!

01:04.468 --> 01:06.286
Just repeat what I said.

01:06.354 --> 01:08.655
He said, if we back out
of the deal,

01:08.740 --> 01:10.974
he's going to kill
Tiffany and the kids.

01:11.025 --> 01:12.475
DAVID: Oh, my God,
Paul, listen to me.

01:12.527 --> 01:14.328
Oh, no, no!

01:14.412 --> 01:16.029
DAVID: Do whatever he says.

01:16.114 --> 01:18.448
We will go through with it.
He says we'll go through with it!

01:18.500 --> 01:21.952
We can do it tomorrow!
Th-Th-The same arrangement!

01:22.003 --> 01:23.620
Please don't do this!

01:23.671 --> 01:24.938
(grunts, blows)

01:25.006 --> 01:27.508

01:29.928 --> 01:32.763
Oh, God, oh, my God,

Oh, God! No! Please!

I'm sorry, what? Did you say

Yes. This delicious blend

will enhance every aspect

02:49.257 --> 02:52.009

What is in there?
Tastes like actual wood.

03:01.052 --> 03:03.353
Well, it's not juicing--
you use the whole fruit--

03:03.421 --> 03:05.239
so what you're tasting
are the grape stems.

03:05.306 --> 03:07.057
You put stems in?

03:07.108 --> 03:09.008
Th-Th-The book said
to use the whole fruit.

03:10.862 --> 03:11.739

03:11.764 --> 03:13.493
You realized I could
have choked to death?

03:14.937 --> 03:17.060
I always figured Deeks

03:37.138 --> 03:38.255
Nice meeting you.

03:38.306 --> 03:39.806
Long way from home.

03:39.891 --> 03:42.426
I rarely work back in Stockholm.

03:42.477 --> 03:43.844
Agent Kallstrom's working a case

03:43.928 --> 03:46.897
that might have ties
with one of yours.

03:46.964 --> 03:49.733
Last week, two
pharmaceutical executives

03:49.800 --> 03:51.818
were killed here in Los Angeles.

03:51.903 --> 03:54.354
GRANGER: They were illegally
selling expired medicines--

03:54.439 --> 03:58.442
antibiotics, AIDS medication
that were due to be destroyed.

03:58.493 --> 04:01.161
Executives got cold feet and
were backing out of the deal.

04:01.245 --> 04:04.164
The buyer killed the two men,

04:04.248 --> 04:05.832
and their boss
delivered the shipment

04:05.917 --> 04:07.951
of pharmaceuticals
four hours later.

04:08.002 --> 04:09.886
What's our connection?

04:09.954 --> 04:12.822
The M.O. of the killing.
(taps key)

04:12.874 --> 04:15.842
Burnt car, telephone call--
same M.O.'s used

04:15.927 --> 04:19.178
by a French-Moroccan
arms-dealing gang

04:19.262 --> 04:22.265
led by, uh, Zahid DeGramont.

04:23.885 --> 04:26.136
We took out DeGramont
and his gang six months ago.

04:26.187 --> 04:27.354
(intercom beeps)

04:27.438 --> 04:30.407
Eric, pull up the takedown
video on DeGramont.

04:30.475 --> 04:32.025
You got it, Sam.

04:32.110 --> 04:36.697
I tracked his M.O.
to three continents now.

04:36.781 --> 04:39.132
Russia, Brazil...

04:39.200 --> 04:40.283
and now here.

04:40.351 --> 04:42.269
That's not DeGramont.

04:42.337 --> 04:43.553
He's dead.

04:43.621 --> 04:47.040
Then maybe somebody else
in his gang.

04:47.125 --> 04:49.676
ERIC: All right, Sam, here's
that surveillance video.

04:49.744 --> 04:51.378
(gunfire, men groaning)

04:51.462 --> 04:53.680
SAM: Almost everyone
in the organization

04:53.748 --> 04:55.799
was killed during
the takedown.

04:55.866 --> 04:59.336
Well, the only person that lived
was a low-level driver,

04:59.387 --> 05:00.670
Karim or something...

05:00.722 --> 05:02.422
He was shot in the face

05:02.507 --> 05:03.557
but he survived.

05:03.641 --> 05:04.624
Ghilas?

05:05.760 --> 05:07.710
Ghilas. Karim Ghilas.

05:07.762 --> 05:10.831
He pled out. He's in Oakville
doing his time.

05:10.898 --> 05:14.717
Maybe he knows someone
who would use the same M.O.

05:14.769 --> 05:17.604
See, if I can catch the one
who killed those two

05:17.688 --> 05:20.607
pharmaceutical executives,
then I could know for sure

05:20.691 --> 05:23.777
if this case is related
to the ones I'm working on

05:23.861 --> 05:25.796
in Brazil and Russia.
All right,

05:25.863 --> 05:27.197
we'll talk to Ghilas.

05:27.248 --> 05:29.349
Can we get what you
have in other cases?

05:29.417 --> 05:31.918
Of course, I'll send you
anything you need.

05:32.003 --> 05:33.336
Thank you.

05:36.791 --> 05:38.725

05:38.793 --> 05:40.927

05:43.965 --> 05:45.899
(gate slamming)

05:45.967 --> 05:47.968
Face the right.

05:48.052 --> 05:50.053
That's not Ghilas.

05:52.607 --> 05:56.226
WARDEN: Name, number, photo ID.

05:56.277 --> 05:58.278
That's Ghilas.

06:01.732 --> 06:05.168
WARDEN: Karim Ghilas.
Incarcerated in the

06:05.236 --> 06:08.104
Danville Federal Prison
hospital ward six months ago,

06:08.156 --> 06:11.107
and then transported here
to Oakville five months ago.

06:11.159 --> 06:14.294
That's all the same information,
but that's not the guy I shot.

06:14.378 --> 06:17.130
He was French, he was taller,
he was skinnier.

06:17.215 --> 06:20.967
(cell phone rings)

06:21.052 --> 06:22.302
Yeah, Eric.

06:22.386 --> 06:24.304
Hey, I just ran
the facial recognition.

06:24.388 --> 06:27.808
The prisoner you just met, his
real name is Hector Ramirez.

06:27.892 --> 06:31.161
Five months ago, when Ramirez
was due to be released

06:31.229 --> 06:33.647
from Danville, a wire transfer
of $100,000

06:33.731 --> 06:34.781
made to Ramirez's family

06:34.849 --> 06:36.850
in Mexico.
ERIC: Hey, it also looks like

06:36.934 --> 06:41.588
a prison administrator named
Wundari was paid $250,000

06:41.656 --> 06:44.074
to switch Ghilas
and Ramirez's record,

06:44.141 --> 06:46.860
just as Ghilas was transferred
to Oakville Prison.

06:46.944 --> 06:48.795
Need to track down
an administrator

06:48.863 --> 06:50.680
in Danville named Wundari.

06:50.748 --> 06:52.799
Yeah, you're not gonna find him.

06:52.867 --> 06:54.951
He quit two days after
he received the money

06:55.002 --> 06:56.486
and boarded a flight
to Indonesia.

06:58.155 --> 06:59.840
Don't bother.

07:01.159 --> 07:02.992
(siren wails)

07:03.044 --> 07:04.928
CALLEN: $350,000 for a driver?

07:04.995 --> 07:07.163
Who finances an escape
like that?

07:07.215 --> 07:09.832
Maybe he threatened
to roll on somebody.

07:09.884 --> 07:12.519
Maybe he had that
kind of money.

07:12.603 --> 07:15.355
What else do you
remember about him?

07:16.607 --> 07:18.892
You the cop who shot me?

07:21.062 --> 07:23.313
The bullet is still in my head.

07:23.364 --> 07:25.031
My mouth doesn't work.

07:25.116 --> 07:28.451
Ghilas, everyone in
your gang is dead,

07:28.519 --> 07:31.288
including your
boss DeGramont.

07:31.355 --> 07:33.690
There's nobody left to protect.
What?

07:33.741 --> 07:35.325
You've been doing yourself
a big favor

07:35.376 --> 07:36.927
if you tell us
where the weapons are.

07:36.994 --> 07:41.715
DeGramont said I wouldn't be
involved in anything like this.

07:41.799 --> 07:46.186
Come on... I know
you know something.

07:46.254 --> 07:52.726
I took DeGramont to a
storage place in Boyle Heights.

07:52.810 --> 07:55.212
That's all I know.

07:55.279 --> 07:58.949
I swear to God.

07:59.016 --> 08:01.384
I swear to God.

08:05.189 --> 08:08.441
It's funny, most guys would
have given up the weapons

08:08.526 --> 08:09.943
for less prison time.

08:10.027 --> 08:12.195
Maybe he knew
he had another way out.

08:12.246 --> 08:14.364
(siren wailing)

08:14.415 --> 08:15.565
Sam...

08:15.633 --> 08:18.401
(siren wailing)

08:18.452 --> 08:21.070
I missed something.

08:27.011 --> 08:29.596
NELL: There's DeGramont;
Sam shot him first,

08:29.680 --> 08:32.082
(gunfire, men groaning)
then his guys go down.

08:32.149 --> 08:33.133
Play it again, Nell.

08:35.885 --> 08:37.020
Okay, freeze it.

08:37.087 --> 08:38.722
Zoom in on DeGramont
and Ghilas, the driver.

08:40.424 --> 08:41.424
Keep playing it.

08:41.475 --> 08:43.860
(gunfire, men groaning)

08:46.147 --> 08:48.365
ERIC: So, it looks like Wundari,
the prison administrator,

08:48.432 --> 08:50.533
erased all photos of Ghilas.

08:50.601 --> 08:52.769
Well, we must have
the NCIS booking photos, though.

08:52.820 --> 08:55.780
Yeah, they're all of a guy with
his head covered in bandages.

08:55.805 --> 08:57.005
SAM: Great.

08:57.041 --> 08:58.875
You think you'd recognize this guy
if you saw him again?

08:58.942 --> 09:00.794
I don't know.
Maybe if I heard his voice.

09:00.878 --> 09:03.880
Wait a second. Eric, run
DeGramont through facial recognition.

09:05.333 --> 09:08.101
All right,
we got his autopsy photo,

09:08.169 --> 09:10.119
French passport,
French driver's license,

09:10.171 --> 09:12.639
ID from a paper company
he worked at.

09:12.723 --> 09:14.123
Wait a second. Go back.

09:15.993 --> 09:17.394
Right there!

09:17.461 --> 09:19.813
That's DeGramont's photo
but the name on the card is...

09:19.897 --> 09:21.681
Ghilas.

09:21.766 --> 09:22.932
He's not giving orders,
he's taking them.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.951
The guy making the deal
isn't DeGramont.

09:25.019 --> 09:27.604
So, the driver, the guy
I interrogated in the hospital

09:27.655 --> 09:29.656
was DeGramont.

09:39.877 --> 09:41.828
DeGramont posed as the driver.

09:41.879 --> 09:43.213
His backstopping
was meticulous.

09:43.297 --> 09:44.548
It went back
for years:

09:44.632 --> 09:46.499
IDs, passports.

09:46.551 --> 09:48.635
So this guy's the real brains
behind the arms-dealing gang.

09:48.702 --> 09:50.053
These guys were big-time.

09:50.137 --> 09:51.922
Explains why he had the cash
to buy his way out of prison.

09:52.006 --> 09:54.024
KENSI: He switched his identity
in the gang.

09:54.091 --> 09:56.276
He switched his identity
to get out of prison.

09:56.344 --> 09:58.562
That's his M.O.
He's a chameleon.

09:58.646 --> 10:00.730
And we don't know what
the chameleon looks like.

10:00.815 --> 10:02.065
GRANGER: So you blew it.

10:03.267 --> 10:04.768
You had him and you let him go.

10:04.852 --> 10:07.404
DeGramont escaped from prison;
that's not on us.

10:07.488 --> 10:09.239
This has got nothing to do
with you, Agent Hanna.

10:09.323 --> 10:13.076
You were not in the hospital
when he interrogated this guy.

10:14.612 --> 10:16.246
I'll let Agent Kallstrom
know DeGramont--

10:16.330 --> 10:18.365
or whatever his name is--
is out of prison.

10:18.416 --> 10:19.866
This is on me.

10:19.917 --> 10:21.167
You're damn right it is.

10:21.252 --> 10:23.453
I will find him.

10:23.537 --> 10:25.338
You'd better, because
anything he does from now on,

10:25.406 --> 10:27.240
including barbecuing
those guys in the car,

10:27.291 --> 10:29.926
that is also on you.

10:32.513 --> 10:34.798
I don't know why you were
sent here, but if you...

10:34.882 --> 10:37.717
You really going to defend
your agent on this?

10:37.785 --> 10:40.220
He doesn't need defending.

10:40.271 --> 10:43.773
But if you're trying
to take down my team, you will.

10:47.728 --> 10:49.562
Deeks, I want to
see what LAPD...

10:49.614 --> 10:51.982
Has on the two dead
pharmaceutical executives.

10:52.066 --> 10:53.733
Yeah, I'm on it.
Don't wait for me, go.

10:53.784 --> 10:55.869
It's gonna be waiting for you
in the evidence garage.

10:55.936 --> 10:57.203
Kensi, have Kallstrom
meet us there.

10:57.271 --> 10:58.204
Got it.

10:58.272 --> 11:00.240
(siren whoops)

11:04.578 --> 11:07.297
Here's the car.

11:07.381 --> 11:10.717
And all the evidence that
LAPD has shared with me.

11:10.784 --> 11:12.102
Not much burned.

11:12.169 --> 11:13.920
Not much gasoline.

11:13.971 --> 11:17.474
They were unconscious but alive
when the ambulance showed up.

11:17.558 --> 11:19.926
That's a bad way to go.

11:19.977 --> 11:22.679
Ah, it's an
intimidation tactic,

11:22.763 --> 11:26.349
not a-- what do you
call it?-- a hit.

11:26.434 --> 11:28.468
What did the cops think
they used to start the fire?

11:28.519 --> 11:30.937
Well, the window was open,
like it is now.

11:30.988 --> 11:32.539
They must have pushed
something through.

11:32.606 --> 11:34.357
Like a match
or a little piece of paper.

11:34.442 --> 11:35.825
Mm-hmm.

11:35.910 --> 11:38.161
What would you do?

11:38.245 --> 11:42.916
If the igniter didn't hit the
gas immediately, stomp it out.

11:46.671 --> 11:48.705
No.

11:48.789 --> 11:51.341
Nothing here.

11:55.546 --> 11:56.880
Hey.

11:58.349 --> 12:01.384
That could be a match book.

12:01.469 --> 12:04.854
Let's send it to Eric.

12:06.774 --> 12:07.991
CALLEN:
You make anything out of this?

12:08.059 --> 12:11.111
2003 Oklahoma
State High School

12:11.178 --> 12:13.146
Jigsaw Puzzle Champ.

12:13.197 --> 12:14.164
You shouldn't
tell people that.

12:14.231 --> 12:15.532
What does it matter?

12:16.600 --> 12:17.984
Aw, you guys,

12:18.035 --> 12:20.453
this brings back memories of
tea and cookies with my Gammy.

12:20.521 --> 12:23.573
She used to teach me
how to do puzzles.

12:23.657 --> 12:25.892
Oh, you're right.
Doesn't matter.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.578
NELL: Courtesy of our friends
at Homeland Security,

12:28.662 --> 12:30.163
I just sent you the
audio of the call

12:30.214 --> 12:31.681
from the executives who
were killed last night.

12:31.749 --> 12:32.682
Open it up, Eric.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.201
Okay, let's see.

12:35.252 --> 12:37.203
Uh, this goes here,
these two flip...

12:37.254 --> 12:39.205
CALLER: Hello?
PAUL: David?!

12:39.256 --> 12:40.540
Um, it's my puzzle.

12:40.591 --> 12:41.891
(on phone): It's Paul.

12:41.976 --> 12:43.560
Enhance the shooter's voice.

12:43.644 --> 12:45.711
PAUL: We've been shot.
DAVID: What are you talking about?

12:45.763 --> 12:48.381
SHOOTER (Russian accent): Tell
him, he backs out of the deal,

12:48.432 --> 12:51.818
I will kill his wife
and children.

12:51.885 --> 12:54.270
Russian.

12:54.355 --> 12:57.874
The accent is eastern, it's
urban, it's most likely Moscow.

12:57.942 --> 12:59.743
When I talked to DeGramont
in the hospital,

12:59.827 --> 13:03.246
he had a lower-class
French accent.

13:03.330 --> 13:05.215
Eric, open Agent Kallstrom's
record of the Russian hit

13:05.282 --> 13:06.933
that matched the L.A. M.O.

13:07.001 --> 13:09.753
Maybe Kallstrom's
Russian guy came to L.A.

13:10.788 --> 13:12.122
NELL: Ah.

13:12.206 --> 13:13.590
I got the word "Edison."

13:15.459 --> 13:16.593
CALLEN: Edison.

13:16.677 --> 13:17.644
Great work, Nell.

13:17.711 --> 13:19.379
Thanks.

13:19.430 --> 13:20.630
I'm supposed to be
the puzzle master.

13:20.698 --> 13:22.432
There's actually a club
called the Edison.

13:22.516 --> 13:24.134
Yes, I know it.

13:24.218 --> 13:25.552
Yeah, I probably
know it better.

13:25.603 --> 13:27.804
In fact, I'm gonna go
check that out by myself.

13:27.888 --> 13:28.938
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bub.

13:29.023 --> 13:30.557
Wait, come back here.

13:30.608 --> 13:33.726
Let me guess, there's a crazy
ex-girlfriend involved.

13:33.778 --> 13:37.447
With anger/jealousy/
trust/more anger issues.

13:37.531 --> 13:39.449
That and the fact I
told her my partner

13:39.533 --> 13:41.201
was a bald
50-year-old fat man,

13:41.268 --> 13:43.736
which you are
clearly not.

13:43.804 --> 13:45.071
You lied to her.

13:45.122 --> 13:46.439
Yeah, just to
make her happy.

13:46.490 --> 13:47.624
ERIC: Here is the audio

13:47.708 --> 13:49.209
for the Russian case.

13:49.276 --> 13:50.210
MAN: Hello.

13:50.277 --> 13:51.661
MAN 2: Sergei, he shot me.

13:51.745 --> 13:52.996
MAN: He's with you still?

13:53.080 --> 13:55.665
MAN 3: Tell him if
he does not give me my price,

13:55.749 --> 13:59.836
I will kill his wife
and his mother and his father.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.504
MAN 2: Please.
Are you surprised?

14:01.589 --> 14:03.640
He's going to kill you.
You tell them to go to hell!

14:03.724 --> 14:04.924
They're all speaking English.

14:04.992 --> 14:07.110
MAN 3: Tell him what I am doing.

14:07.178 --> 14:08.678
Shooter's got a
French accent.

14:08.762 --> 14:10.530
Sounds like DeGramont.

14:10.598 --> 14:12.982
And here is
the Brazilian case.

14:13.050 --> 14:13.983
MAN: Yeah?

14:14.068 --> 14:15.985
MAN 2: These bastards shot me!

14:16.070 --> 14:18.021
MAN: You're kidding me.
What does he want?

14:18.105 --> 14:19.105
MAN 3: Tell him I want...

14:19.156 --> 14:20.973
Also speaking English.

14:21.025 --> 14:24.494
MAN 3: Now, or I will kill him
and his brother.

14:24.578 --> 14:26.329
Russian accent again.

14:26.413 --> 14:29.782
So the Russian guy
is here and Brazil,

14:29.834 --> 14:32.001
and DeGramont is here
and Russia.

14:32.086 --> 14:33.620
We're looking for two guys.

14:33.671 --> 14:36.606
No. DeGramont's M.O.
is switching identities.

14:37.791 --> 14:39.158
This is three large
criminal organizations

14:39.210 --> 14:40.293
on three different continents.

14:40.344 --> 14:42.345
The words are too similar.

14:42.429 --> 14:44.547
Also, listen to the sound
of the voice,

14:44.632 --> 14:47.267
the-the vowels, the gutturals.

14:47.334 --> 14:48.985
This is all the same person.

14:51.105 --> 14:54.390
One guy can assume all these
accents, all these identities?

15:00.447 --> 15:02.448
He's the best I've ever seen.

15:15.855 --> 15:16.822
(clears throat)

15:16.873 --> 15:18.157
(knife thuds
against cutting board)

15:18.208 --> 15:19.158
(sighs)

15:19.209 --> 15:20.435
LAPD.

15:20.437 --> 15:22.522
You got some nerve
coming in here.

15:23.619 --> 15:25.280
Hello, Erin.

15:25.282 --> 15:27.483
Sneaking out in the middle of
dinner so I have to pay the tab.

15:27.567 --> 15:28.834
In all fairness,
I gave the waiter $100

15:28.902 --> 15:30.819
and you were trying
to pepper-spray me.

15:31.592 --> 15:33.857
And now I'm here on police
business, so if you stab me,

15:33.859 --> 15:36.661
it's gonna be considered
assaulting a police officer.

15:38.447 --> 15:39.447
What's this about?

15:39.498 --> 15:41.750
We're looking for this guy.

15:42.735 --> 15:43.902
And you think he was in here?

15:43.969 --> 15:45.120
I do.

15:45.171 --> 15:47.005
He's wanted in connection
with a double murder,

15:47.073 --> 15:48.990
so any information you have
would be helpful.

15:49.041 --> 15:51.176
Sorry, I don't
recognize him.

15:51.260 --> 15:53.845
(loud thud)
You sure about that?

15:53.929 --> 15:56.965
Yeah, sure.

15:57.016 --> 15:59.801
What about you guys?

15:59.852 --> 16:01.319
Hmm?

16:01.387 --> 16:02.554
You know this guy?

16:02.638 --> 16:04.155
Nothing.

16:04.223 --> 16:06.691
Hey. You didn't
even look at it.

16:06.776 --> 16:09.444
Can't see anything
in that photo.

16:11.730 --> 16:14.065
(knife thudding
against cutting board)

16:17.787 --> 16:20.789
Erin, angel, can you
please look at the photo?

16:22.792 --> 16:24.192
I don't know him.

16:24.243 --> 16:26.744
They said he could possibly have
a French or Russian accent.

16:26.829 --> 16:29.247
There was a guy it could be.

16:29.331 --> 16:31.082
Sounded Russian,
and then I saw him again,

16:31.167 --> 16:34.002
he had dyed his hair blonde and
he sounded-- what did you say?

16:34.053 --> 16:35.753
French. Why'd you think
it was the same guy?

16:35.838 --> 16:38.723
He only liked girls
with serious ink.

16:38.808 --> 16:40.892
Okay.

16:40.976 --> 16:44.729
Um, thank you for looking.

16:44.814 --> 16:46.264
I appreciate it, really.

16:46.348 --> 16:48.433
I hope you get paralyzed
in a car accident.

16:48.517 --> 16:50.935
(chuckles)

16:51.020 --> 16:52.553
Okay.

16:52.605 --> 16:54.405
You, uh, you look fantastic.

16:54.490 --> 16:56.390
You're still obviously crazy.

16:57.109 --> 16:58.576
But... Hey!
(thud)

16:58.661 --> 17:00.495
I'm gonna leave that
and just go.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.896
But I'll call you.

17:01.947 --> 17:03.915
(whispers):
Probably not.

17:03.999 --> 17:05.366
Oh, yes.

17:05.416 --> 17:08.752
An affinity for tattoos
is one of the details

17:08.838 --> 17:11.172
provided to me
by the Brazilian police.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.507
What else?

17:12.574 --> 17:14.125
He's got a scar
on his cheek,

17:14.210 --> 17:15.792
he's facile in
several languages...

17:15.877 --> 17:16.961
I don't think he is.

17:17.046 --> 17:18.963
On all the phone recordings,

17:19.048 --> 17:21.382
he required everyone
to use English.

17:21.433 --> 17:22.967
He always pretends
to be a foreigner

17:23.051 --> 17:25.637
and then uses English
as a common language.

17:25.721 --> 17:28.272
An accent's a lot easier than
being fluent in a language.

17:28.357 --> 17:29.807
And he gives the appearance
of having

17:29.892 --> 17:31.309
a gang or an organization,

17:31.393 --> 17:33.895
but it's really just hired guys
doing one-offs.

17:33.963 --> 17:37.482
He also has an amazing ability
for physical transformation.

17:37.566 --> 17:39.651
You seem impressed
with him.

17:39.735 --> 17:40.952
I've spent my whole life

17:41.036 --> 17:42.487
pretending to be
somebody I'm not.

17:42.571 --> 17:45.957
Perhaps he's better at it
than you.

17:47.993 --> 17:50.111
Maybe.

17:50.162 --> 17:51.579
Until I catch him.

17:51.630 --> 17:52.664
Confident.

17:52.748 --> 17:53.915
Resolute.

17:53.966 --> 17:57.835
So, if this is
all one man

17:57.920 --> 18:00.505
in Brazil,
Russia, now here,

18:00.589 --> 18:04.625
then this chameleon has
worked in all kinds of

18:04.677 --> 18:07.111
criminal
enterprises, huh?

18:07.179 --> 18:10.315
Arms trading,
black-market pharmaceuticals

18:10.399 --> 18:11.983
and counterfeit
currencies.

18:12.067 --> 18:12.984
Really?

18:13.068 --> 18:14.152
Really.

18:14.236 --> 18:16.654
Why is he staying in L.A.?

18:16.739 --> 18:17.989
He's acquired
the pharmaceuticals

18:18.073 --> 18:19.791
and doesn't want to leave
before he moves them.

18:19.858 --> 18:21.409
Meds have
an expiration date.

18:21.476 --> 18:22.827
The longer
they don't move...

18:22.912 --> 18:24.379
The less valuable they are.

18:24.446 --> 18:25.930
According to
the records

18:25.998 --> 18:27.415
from the pharmaceutical company,

18:27.482 --> 18:29.867
right now he could get over
six million dollars for them.

18:29.952 --> 18:32.036
In a month,
they'll be worth half that.

18:32.121 --> 18:33.137
Hmm.

18:33.205 --> 18:34.455
Who's he sell to?

18:34.506 --> 18:36.958
Expired meds usually go
to black markets,

18:37.009 --> 18:38.876
mostly Third World countries.

18:38.961 --> 18:40.628
Eric, look into the banks
from developing countries

18:40.679 --> 18:42.680
that have consulates
located here in Los Angeles.

18:42.765 --> 18:45.333
Looking for large transactions,
four to six million dollars.

18:45.384 --> 18:46.334
ERIC: Got it.

18:46.385 --> 18:47.318
Kensi.

18:47.386 --> 18:48.770
Undercover, the Edison Club.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.838
I'll get some tats, see if
we get lucky, draw him out.

18:50.889 --> 18:52.890
KALLSTROM: Going
undercover with this man

18:52.958 --> 18:55.059
is not a good idea.

18:55.144 --> 18:58.997
Agent Blye is excellent
at what she does.

18:59.064 --> 19:02.500
This chameleon is a sociopath.

19:02.568 --> 19:04.786
He will kill instantly
if he has to.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.120
And so will I.

19:08.157 --> 19:09.958
Then I hope your tattoos
are pretty,

19:10.025 --> 19:11.993
because you might get
buried with them.

19:12.061 --> 19:15.163
Only ones doing any burying
around here is gonna be us.

19:15.214 --> 19:17.165
Let's get this thing started.

19:17.216 --> 19:18.833
Agent Callen.

19:18.884 --> 19:22.170
This chameleon is always

19:22.221 --> 19:24.555
one level deeper than you think.

19:24.640 --> 19:28.009
And when you're looking
him in the eye,

19:28.060 --> 19:30.528
it won't be him.

19:34.566 --> 19:36.567
(club music playing)

19:56.622 --> 19:59.073
SAM: Your car doesn't look
that good when you drive it.

20:02.878 --> 20:05.480
Where the hell is Kallstrom?

20:08.133 --> 20:10.351
Bearded guy, left of the
door, front of the line.

20:11.937 --> 20:13.638
Yeah, he's hooked.

20:21.814 --> 20:23.898
She's going to catch
a lot of fish.

20:23.949 --> 20:25.666
Too many.

20:25.734 --> 20:28.453
(breathing heavily)

20:28.537 --> 20:30.538
(club music playing)

20:32.825 --> 20:35.960
CALLEN: If Kallstrom
walks into that club,

20:36.045 --> 20:38.162
our bad guy smells a cop,

20:38.247 --> 20:39.764
he may run.

20:39.832 --> 20:41.716
You stay with Kensi;
I'll stay out here.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.601
Stop Kallstrom
before he goes inside.

20:43.669 --> 20:45.119
(car door opens)
Okay.

20:51.143 --> 20:53.144
(heavy breathing)

21:03.489 --> 21:06.023
(heavy breathing)

21:06.108 --> 21:08.109
(club music playing)

21:31.517 --> 21:32.800
Here you are.

21:32.851 --> 21:34.185
Thanks.

21:35.354 --> 21:37.438
What are you drinking?

21:37.506 --> 21:39.340
Ooh. Hi.

21:39.391 --> 21:40.341
Hi.

21:40.392 --> 21:42.059
JD on the rocks.

21:42.144 --> 21:43.561
JD on the rocks.

21:43.645 --> 21:45.696
On my tab.

21:45.781 --> 21:47.848
That's a hard drink.

21:47.900 --> 21:48.983
You think so?

21:49.034 --> 21:50.451
Yeah, I do.
Just like I like it.

21:50.519 --> 21:51.786
CALLEN (over earpiece):
It's not him.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.354
Shot the guy in the face.

21:53.405 --> 21:55.022
He should have a scar
on his right jaw.

21:55.073 --> 21:56.073
Cut him loose.

21:56.158 --> 21:57.542
KENSI: Aw...

21:57.626 --> 21:59.627
do I have to?

21:59.694 --> 22:01.162
He's a cutie pie.

22:01.213 --> 22:02.497
Uh, who you talking to?

22:02.548 --> 22:03.498
CALLEN: Lose him.

22:03.549 --> 22:05.416
(giggles)

22:05.501 --> 22:08.219
I'm talking to the
voices in my head.

22:08.303 --> 22:11.539
They say the craziest things
at that time of the month.

22:11.590 --> 22:13.207
You know what I'm saying?
It's like, wa-wa-wa-wa!

22:13.258 --> 22:14.759
I'm like, shut up!

22:14.843 --> 22:15.927
So, you into colonics?

22:17.563 --> 22:19.380
I got to go.
Huh.

22:20.899 --> 22:22.433
DEEKS: Yeah, you are good
at scaring them off.

22:22.518 --> 22:24.051
That's too bad. I liked him.

22:24.102 --> 22:25.169
DEEKS: Really?

22:25.237 --> 22:26.654
How can you fall for that?

22:26.721 --> 22:28.856
There's obviously just
one thing on that guy's mind.

22:28.907 --> 22:31.209
How's that any different from
somebody like, say, you, Deeks?

22:31.276 --> 22:33.060
DEEKS: Well, first off,

22:33.111 --> 22:35.196
I would have been successful.

22:35.247 --> 22:37.281
In picking me up?
Uh-huh.

22:37.366 --> 22:39.167
We'd be in the car
right now, heading home.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.585
You'd be drunk,
sitting in my lap,

22:40.669 --> 22:42.903
telling me I'm gonna wake up
with bite marks on my neck.

22:42.955 --> 22:44.138
Too much information.

22:44.206 --> 22:45.756
Except for the fact
that you're not my type.

22:45.841 --> 22:47.041
I am, too, your type.

22:47.092 --> 22:48.292
I'm sorry, what?

22:48.377 --> 22:50.094
Can I just get confirmation
that we just heard that.

22:50.179 --> 22:52.063
I did not mean it that way,
and you know it.

22:52.130 --> 22:52.730
I heard it.

22:52.798 --> 22:54.098
I heard it, too.

22:54.183 --> 22:55.299
Are we, uh, recording this,

22:55.384 --> 22:59.937
'cause I would love to use that
as my ringtone.

23:00.022 --> 23:02.056
DEEKS: Hey, Kens?

23:02.107 --> 23:04.408
That bartended can't
take his eyes off you.

23:04.476 --> 23:05.776
Deeks, talk to him.

23:05.861 --> 23:07.895
Get a photo, run it
through facial rec.

23:07.946 --> 23:08.762
Done.

23:08.814 --> 23:10.648
Knew I couldn't trust that guy.

23:11.817 --> 23:14.118
Hey, uh, sugar bear?

23:14.203 --> 23:15.620
(shutter clicks)

23:15.704 --> 23:16.621
What kind of tequila you got?

23:16.705 --> 23:17.371
Kens.

23:18.123 --> 23:19.607
Take a walk.

23:19.658 --> 23:21.092
Let's get you
a little more exposure.

23:21.159 --> 23:23.294
You got it.

23:35.007 --> 23:37.508
I got an Axl Rose wannabe
following Kensi.

23:37.593 --> 23:39.443
Scar?
CALLEN: Long hair.

23:39.511 --> 23:40.845
I can't see.

23:48.654 --> 23:51.322
I think I might have
scared him off.

23:51.406 --> 23:53.774
Gonna follow him; want to see
if this guy's got a scar.

23:53.825 --> 23:54.775
I'll powder my nose

23:54.826 --> 23:56.827
until you get back.

24:11.043 --> 24:13.044
(laughter and chatter)

24:34.366 --> 24:38.035
(with thick accent):
Your tattoos are beautiful.

24:39.237 --> 24:41.038
Well, I like your beard.

24:41.123 --> 24:43.741
MAN: I'd like to see more

24:43.825 --> 24:46.410
of your artwork.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.382
Well, you move fast.

24:51.466 --> 24:54.018
When I know it's what you want.

24:54.086 --> 24:56.253
What you, uh...

24:56.338 --> 24:58.589
need.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.375
Come.

25:03.145 --> 25:05.313
We're going
through the back?

25:05.380 --> 25:06.430
Yes.

25:06.515 --> 25:07.565
Sam, back alley.

25:07.649 --> 25:09.617
I heard.

25:09.685 --> 25:11.686
Oh. Just...

25:16.942 --> 25:18.275
Thank you.

25:20.779 --> 25:21.862
What?

25:21.913 --> 25:23.781
(chuckles) Sorry about that.

25:23.865 --> 25:26.617
I thought you were someone else.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.204
Oh!

25:30.255 --> 25:30.921
(laughing)

25:36.261 --> 25:38.012
Mmm...

25:38.079 --> 25:39.430
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:39.514 --> 25:41.799
Maybe we move a
little slower. Huh?

25:41.883 --> 25:43.684
Slower.
Slower?

25:43.752 --> 25:45.403
Yeah.
(chuckling)

25:45.470 --> 25:47.805
(grunting)

25:47.889 --> 25:50.307
Federal agent.
Don't move.

25:50.392 --> 25:52.193
What are you talking about, huh?

25:55.364 --> 25:56.364
Is this a joke?

25:57.149 --> 25:58.315
There's no scar.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.583
You okay?

25:59.651 --> 26:01.101
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:01.153 --> 26:02.319
What do you got?

26:02.404 --> 26:04.071
Renaldo Maggio.

26:04.122 --> 26:06.123
Yo, man, listen to me,
I didn't do anything.

26:06.208 --> 26:07.575
You assaulted a federal agent.

26:07.626 --> 26:09.076
(with no accent): What are you
talking about? You set me up.

26:09.127 --> 26:10.911
She tell you
to pull out a knife?

26:10.962 --> 26:12.279
That's what her husband
said she wanted.

26:12.330 --> 26:12.997
What?

26:13.081 --> 26:14.248
The Kevinslist ad.

26:14.299 --> 26:15.449
You wanted a man

26:15.500 --> 26:17.001
with a thick beard
and an Italian accent, right?

26:17.085 --> 26:19.170
Take you outside the club
and cut off your panties.

26:19.254 --> 26:20.454
Listen, it's in the e-mails.

26:20.505 --> 26:22.339
I'm not even Italian.

26:22.424 --> 26:24.091
He set us up.

26:24.142 --> 26:25.593
He wanted us to be here.

26:25.644 --> 26:27.945
This guy's just some creep
that answered an adult personal.

26:28.013 --> 26:29.480
Yeah, yeah, and her husband's
here watching somewhere,

26:29.564 --> 26:31.315
all right?
He's stalking us.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.984
SAM: Take him home.

26:34.069 --> 26:36.187
Get his laptop,
check his story.

26:36.271 --> 26:38.322
Take it easy, man.

26:38.407 --> 26:40.641
How did he know
we were gonna be here?

26:40.692 --> 26:43.160
(phone chirping)

26:45.197 --> 26:47.281
It's Maggio's phone.

26:47.332 --> 26:49.667
It's a video text.

26:51.703 --> 26:53.671
Why would Kallstrom
text this guy?

26:53.755 --> 26:55.206
That's not from Kallstrom.

26:55.290 --> 26:57.208
Play it.

26:57.292 --> 27:00.511
No! Noooo!

27:00.595 --> 27:02.096
(yelling)

27:17.918 --> 27:20.119
GRANGER: Callen just got
an Interpol Agent killed.

27:20.149 --> 27:22.129
I'm taking over
the investigation.

27:22.130 --> 27:23.180
I'm aware of what occurred,

27:23.265 --> 27:25.733
and I doubt Agent Callen
was responsible.

27:25.801 --> 27:28.669
He was running the operation
when Kallstrom was killed.

27:28.720 --> 27:30.554
Hetty, you and I
go back a long way,

27:30.639 --> 27:32.139
but this has gone off the rails.

27:32.190 --> 27:33.307
Just for the record,

27:33.358 --> 27:36.944
I have complete confidence
in Agent Callen.

27:37.979 --> 27:39.497
I need Interpol

27:39.564 --> 27:40.698
in Stockholm

27:40.782 --> 27:42.700
informed about the death
of Agent Kallstrom.

27:42.784 --> 27:43.818
Already been done.

27:43.869 --> 27:47.671
CALLEN: Eric, bring up
the DeGramont video.

27:47.739 --> 27:49.740
Assistant Director Granger

27:49.825 --> 27:51.409
has taken control
of the investigation.

27:51.493 --> 27:54.245
Anybody have a problem
with that?

27:58.250 --> 28:00.384
Um, (clears throat), I'd
just like to say that...

28:00.469 --> 28:01.552
You don't get a say.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.170
Oh, I'd hear Mr. Beale out.

28:03.238 --> 28:05.372
It's not about the, um,

28:05.440 --> 28:06.540
who's-in-charge-
of-the-case thing.

28:06.608 --> 28:10.194
But I believe that
the chameleons

28:10.262 --> 28:12.663
payout for the pharmaceuticals
has come in.

28:12.731 --> 28:15.099
I just got a hit for a five-
million-dollar cash withdrawal

28:15.183 --> 28:17.551
from the Nigerian Consulate's
bank account.

28:19.571 --> 28:21.021
Don't raise your hand.

28:21.073 --> 28:24.775
I traced the e-mail used
to place the adult personal ad

28:24.860 --> 28:27.411
on Kevinslist to a café
in Santa Monica.

28:27.496 --> 28:29.246
Address is on your phones.

28:29.331 --> 28:31.282
If you trust your people,

28:31.366 --> 28:33.567
it kind of runs itself.

28:36.288 --> 28:37.855
Deeks and Kensi with me,

28:37.923 --> 28:39.774
we'll take the
Nigerian Consulate.

28:39.841 --> 28:42.176
Callen and Sam take the café.

28:53.188 --> 28:55.990
I don't know anything about
the sale of pharmaceuticals.

28:56.057 --> 28:58.242
Could you just look at this
photo and see if you can iden...

28:58.310 --> 29:00.144
I don't want to look
at any photos.

29:00.228 --> 29:01.479
I want you to leave.

29:01.563 --> 29:02.897
This is property

29:02.964 --> 29:03.948
of the Nigerian government.

29:06.034 --> 29:09.102
We got a van.
KENSI:It's got diplomatic plates.

29:09.154 --> 29:10.454
Don't let it on the property.

29:16.328 --> 29:18.078
KENSI:
Federal agents!

29:18.130 --> 29:19.279
Turn it off.

29:19.331 --> 29:22.500
Put your hands up and
step out of the vehicle.

29:24.219 --> 29:28.506
You have no right
to stop our truck.

29:28.590 --> 29:31.258
So, you're taking ownership
of anything we find inside?

29:31.309 --> 29:33.460
(van door opens)

29:35.647 --> 29:37.848
What do we
got, Kens?

29:39.901 --> 29:42.286
Clarithromycin;
it's an antibiotic.

29:42.354 --> 29:44.822
That means the deal's
already gone down.

29:47.075 --> 29:48.826
I need to talk to you.

29:48.910 --> 29:51.829
You can talk to our lawyers.

29:52.864 --> 29:54.198
Look...

29:54.282 --> 29:56.200
We're not concerned
about the medication.

29:56.284 --> 29:58.669
We need to know
who you bought them from.

29:58.753 --> 30:01.088
He's brutally killed
several men.

30:02.340 --> 30:03.591
Please.

30:05.010 --> 30:06.293
(rings)
NELL: Yes?

30:06.344 --> 30:07.711
MAN: I'm requesting
a video conference.

30:07.796 --> 30:10.214
It's a video request
from Interpol, Sweden.

30:10.298 --> 30:11.799
An Agent Johan Linderoth.

30:11.850 --> 30:13.968
That's who I contacted;
bring him up.

30:14.019 --> 30:16.387
(beeping)

30:16.471 --> 30:18.272
Agent Linderoth.

30:18.339 --> 30:19.356
Mr. Beale?

30:19.441 --> 30:21.809
We received your information

30:21.860 --> 30:24.511
about the death
of Agent Martin Kallstrom.

30:24.563 --> 30:27.314
Yes, you have
our condolences.

30:27.365 --> 30:29.750
I have some
very disturbing news.

30:29.818 --> 30:31.669
The man in the video

30:31.736 --> 30:33.204
is not Agent Kallstrom.

30:34.289 --> 30:35.573
Are you sure?

30:35.657 --> 30:36.907
Yes, very.

30:36.992 --> 30:38.993
I'm sending you a photo

30:39.044 --> 30:42.880
of the real Agent Kallstrom
right now.

30:42.964 --> 30:45.599
(beeps)

30:45.667 --> 30:45.716
Where is the real
Agent Kallstrom, then?

30:48.803 --> 30:52.006
We've been trying
to make contact with him, but...

30:52.073 --> 30:54.725
we have heard nothing.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.927
We'll get back to you.

30:59.481 --> 31:00.798
CLERK: I couldn't tell

31:00.865 --> 31:02.900
you anything from that photo.
He was using the Internet.

31:02.984 --> 31:04.618
Most likely,
he had an accent.

31:04.686 --> 31:06.103
There are four large hotels
around here.

31:06.171 --> 31:07.655
I get people
from all over the world.

31:07.722 --> 31:09.523
(beep)
Excuse us. Yeah, Eric?

31:09.591 --> 31:11.058
We just received a call
from Interpol.

31:11.109 --> 31:12.776
The man who died in that car

31:12.861 --> 31:15.395
is not Agent Kallstrom.

31:15.447 --> 31:17.731
All right, get me a video
frame footage of Agent Kallstrom

31:17.782 --> 31:19.199
from the security cams
at the boatshed.

31:19.251 --> 31:21.619
Already sent it and the photo

31:21.703 --> 31:24.371
of the real Agent Kallstrom.

31:24.422 --> 31:26.123
What about this man?
Him, I know.

31:26.207 --> 31:28.292
Came here two or three times,
mostly mornings.

31:28.376 --> 31:29.727
Did he mention
where he was staying?

31:29.794 --> 31:30.844
No.

31:30.912 --> 31:33.246
Ordered coffee,
worked on his computer...

31:33.298 --> 31:36.100
Tell you the truth, I think
he was here this morning.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.269
Thank you.

31:38.353 --> 31:40.020
Thanks.

31:41.056 --> 31:42.139
All right, so he's alive.

31:42.223 --> 31:44.475
He faked the flames
in that video somehow.

31:44.559 --> 31:46.093
My guess is, if he came in here

31:46.144 --> 31:47.945
two or three times,
he's close to here.

31:49.447 --> 31:50.381
(dialing)

31:50.448 --> 31:52.066
What are you doing?

31:52.117 --> 31:53.734
(line ringing)
Taking a shot.

31:53.785 --> 31:55.753
(phone buzzing)

32:06.047 --> 32:09.049
Hello there, Agent Callen.

32:10.618 --> 32:13.170
(whispering): Eric, trace
the call on Callen's phone.

32:13.254 --> 32:14.271
Got it.

32:14.339 --> 32:16.090
You sound alive and well.

32:16.141 --> 32:17.591
Very much.

32:17.642 --> 32:21.729
But the man you know as
Kallstrom will soon disappear.

32:21.796 --> 32:23.597
Gone like smoke.

32:23.648 --> 32:24.732
Okay. We got a location.

32:24.799 --> 32:25.816
The Miramar Hotel.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.901
It's right next door to you.

32:29.404 --> 32:32.573
It's quite funny, because you
seemed smarter to me.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.274
(laughs) But you have nothing.

32:34.342 --> 32:36.360
What if I told you
I had an opportunity

32:36.444 --> 32:37.611
for us to work together?

32:37.679 --> 32:41.115
Lying. Are we trying
to trace my call?

32:41.166 --> 32:43.283
Oh, I'll save you the trouble.

32:43.335 --> 32:45.836
This phone cannot be traced.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.122
You're missing
a good opportunity.

32:48.173 --> 32:50.290
Uh, you're a joke
that is no longer funny.

32:50.342 --> 32:51.291
How do you say...

32:51.343 --> 32:52.459
Good-bye, sucker.

32:52.510 --> 32:54.327
(line disconnects)

33:03.938 --> 33:05.856
Federal agents.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.224
Looking for this man.

33:07.308 --> 33:09.143
Might be registered
under the name Kallstrom.

33:09.194 --> 33:10.444
Kallstrom.

33:11.613 --> 33:13.147
(typing)

33:13.198 --> 33:14.982
He's here. Room 1035.

33:15.033 --> 33:16.700
We need the keycard now.

33:25.526 --> 33:27.161
(whispering):
Clear the hall, please.

33:44.512 --> 33:46.013
(knocking on door)

33:46.064 --> 33:48.215
CALLEN: Room Service.

33:51.736 --> 33:53.553
(beeping)

34:01.196 --> 34:02.062
Clear!

34:07.202 --> 34:09.203
Well...

34:11.706 --> 34:13.956
Meet the real Agent Kallstrom.

34:30.333 --> 34:31.884
I don't understand.

34:31.952 --> 34:33.603
The phone call was traced here.

34:33.670 --> 34:35.004
Yeah, and he said
he couldn't be traced.

34:35.088 --> 34:37.422
Doesn't make sense.

34:37.474 --> 34:40.109
You find any of his
Interpol IDs, passports?

34:40.177 --> 34:41.344
No.

34:41.428 --> 34:46.315
This guy... this guy,
the real...

34:46.400 --> 34:48.300
Agent Kallstrom tracked

34:48.351 --> 34:50.119
a chameleon halfway
around the world.

34:50.187 --> 34:51.621
Then when Kallstrom got to L.A.,

34:51.688 --> 34:53.940
the chameleon killed him
and assumed his identity.

34:54.007 --> 34:56.692
His accent was too real.

34:56.777 --> 34:58.311
Could he be that good?

34:58.378 --> 35:00.279
I don't know.

35:00.330 --> 35:02.632
He doctored Kallstrom's IDs
with his own photos.

35:02.699 --> 35:03.783
Walked right into our case.

35:03.834 --> 35:06.318
With a police escort
from Granger.

35:06.370 --> 35:09.038
And these are all the Interpol
case files on the chameleon.

35:09.122 --> 35:11.874
Now the chameleon knows
everything that the police

35:11.959 --> 35:13.442
in Russia and Brazil
know about him.

35:13.510 --> 35:15.311
He also knows everything
we know about him.

35:15.379 --> 35:17.313
Not good.

35:17.381 --> 35:20.332
Okay. Got it.

35:20.384 --> 35:21.717
Callen and Sam
are going down

35:21.802 --> 35:23.803
to check the hotel
surveillance video.

35:23.854 --> 35:26.839
Is this the, uh, pharmaceutical
sale to the Nigerians?

35:26.890 --> 35:28.057
ERIC:
Warehouse security cam.

35:28.141 --> 35:29.692
It's not helping.

35:29.776 --> 35:31.027
Who's the big guy
in the middle?

35:31.111 --> 35:33.546
This is like all
the chameleon's other jobs.

35:33.614 --> 35:35.331
He's just
a hired hand.

35:35.399 --> 35:36.065
There.

35:36.149 --> 35:37.400
He's on an earwig.

35:37.484 --> 35:39.402
That's gotta be
the chameleon in the van.

35:39.486 --> 35:43.039
Eric, can you zoom in the driver
and freeze it?

35:43.123 --> 35:45.408
That could be a match.

35:45.492 --> 35:46.659
I mean, it could be
the same guy

35:46.710 --> 35:48.077
from the arms deal
six months ago.

35:48.161 --> 35:49.996
And he's pretending
to be the driver again.

35:50.047 --> 35:53.082
He knows where the camera is,
keeps his distance.

35:53.166 --> 35:55.251
KENSI: Eric, pull up the still
of the fake Kallstrom.

35:59.406 --> 36:01.524
It could be the same guy, but...

36:01.591 --> 36:05.144
This guy's very, very good.

36:05.211 --> 36:08.614
Mm-hmm. Good enough
to have fooled you.

36:12.319 --> 36:14.737
You were the one who brought
Kallstrom in here.

36:16.573 --> 36:18.574
You blew it.

36:18.659 --> 36:21.226
You had him and you let him go.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.285
(typing) According to the keycard
access record,

36:29.369 --> 36:32.538
last time anybody entered
Room 1035 was two hours ago.

36:32.606 --> 36:34.040
(line ringing)

36:34.091 --> 36:35.925
Callen?
Kensi?

36:36.009 --> 36:36.375
When did the sale of the
pharmaceuticals go down?

36:36.426 --> 36:38.127
Yeah?

36:38.211 --> 36:39.562
Uh, timecode on the video...

36:39.629 --> 36:40.730
around two hours ago.

36:40.797 --> 36:42.882
And you're sure he was there.

36:42.933 --> 36:44.917
No, I'm not sure about
anything with this guy...

36:44.968 --> 36:46.569
but it looks like the
same person we busted

36:46.636 --> 36:47.586
six months ago.

36:47.637 --> 36:48.637
All right. Thanks.

36:48.722 --> 36:51.607
Here he is, going in, about...

36:51.692 --> 36:53.258
two hours ago.

36:54.895 --> 36:57.396
SAM: Card doesn't work.

36:57.447 --> 36:59.081
CALLEN: He's got a second card.

36:59.149 --> 37:01.534
He has a card to another
room in this hotel.

37:01.601 --> 37:03.202
That's why it
didn't work.

37:03.269 --> 37:04.403
Can you get us
a room number

37:04.454 --> 37:05.488
off the card
that didn't work?

37:05.572 --> 37:07.156
Yeah.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.457
The phone trace
was right.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.743
But why did he think
we couldn't trace him?

37:10.794 --> 37:12.912
That's a good question.
SECURITY OFFICER: The wrong card...

37:12.979 --> 37:15.164
is from 1022.

37:16.133 --> 37:17.299
He's here.

37:29.479 --> 37:31.013
(beeping, door unlocks)

37:32.015 --> 37:33.966
Hands in the air!

37:34.017 --> 37:36.235
How did you find me?

37:38.155 --> 37:39.638
Turn around... slowly.

37:41.191 --> 37:42.458
Turn around!

37:42.526 --> 37:43.475
Hold him still.

37:43.527 --> 37:45.044
(handcuffs clicking)

37:47.364 --> 37:48.781
There's no scar.

37:48.832 --> 37:49.832
It's not him!

37:49.916 --> 37:52.952
Wait a second,
you think I'm him?

37:53.003 --> 37:55.454
No, he hired me and...

37:55.505 --> 37:56.539
(grunting)

37:56.623 --> 37:58.657
He said the phone
was untraceable.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.042
He's setting me up.

38:01.595 --> 38:02.995
I'm not...

38:03.046 --> 38:04.329
(gasping)

38:04.381 --> 38:05.831
him.

38:05.882 --> 38:07.383
Call an ambulance.

38:11.605 --> 38:12.855
OPERATOR: 911 emergency.

38:12.939 --> 38:14.940
I need a rescue
at the Miramar Hotel.

38:15.008 --> 38:17.476
All right, sir, what's the
nature of your emergency?

38:17.527 --> 38:19.195
Sir?
(line disconnects)

38:19.279 --> 38:22.031
(phone ringing)

38:27.454 --> 38:29.405
Hello?

38:29.489 --> 38:29.538
(heavy, wet breathing)

38:34.244 --> 38:35.711
You gonna say something?

38:35.796 --> 38:41.000
I recommend the fish
at this hotel.

38:41.051 --> 38:46.589
I hear it's... killer.

38:46.673 --> 38:46.722
Yeah, well, it didn't go over
too well with your friend here.

38:49.976 --> 38:52.061
Not my friend...

38:52.145 --> 38:53.846
an employee.

38:53.897 --> 38:59.268
Con man, three days
out of a Swedish prison.

38:59.352 --> 39:02.238
He couldn't pass up
a very lucrative job

39:02.322 --> 39:06.375
impersonating an Interpol agent.

39:06.443 --> 39:09.195
Well, I guess, you won't
have to pay him now, will you?

39:09.246 --> 39:12.748
My mouth still
doesn't work right.

39:12.833 --> 39:17.203
I can't breathe,
I can't sleep...

39:17.254 --> 39:20.005
my brain throbs,

39:20.073 --> 39:23.893
thanks to the bullet
you put in my head.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.212
My heart breaks for you.

39:26.263 --> 39:28.547
Agent G. Callen,

39:28.598 --> 39:32.601
I know where you work.

39:32.686 --> 39:35.771
I know where you live.

39:35.856 --> 39:38.140
I know who you care about.

39:38.225 --> 39:40.092
What do you want?

39:43.113 --> 39:46.765
One day, I'm going to kill you.

39:46.816 --> 39:49.434
Soon.

39:49.486 --> 39:52.604
That's all I live for.

39:52.656 --> 39:55.991
It's all I care about.

39:57.994 --> 39:59.545
(water splashing)

39:59.612 --> 40:00.779
(phone disconnects)

40:04.718 --> 40:07.469
I heard something
in the background.

40:07.554 --> 40:08.254
Like what?

40:08.305 --> 40:09.955
The pool.

40:16.963 --> 40:18.297
Hey.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.268
What did he say?

40:22.319 --> 40:24.486
That he's going to kill me.

40:25.522 --> 40:27.740
Heard that before.

40:29.776 --> 40:32.027
Yeah.

40:34.531 --> 40:36.665
But this guy's pretty good.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.820
(gunshots)

40:53.350 --> 40:55.434
Is this supposed
to intimidate me?

40:55.501 --> 40:57.219
Oh, training? No.

40:57.304 --> 41:00.189
It's why we're good
at what we do.

41:00.273 --> 41:02.057
Why'd you ask me over here?

41:02.142 --> 41:05.828
I need to know
why NCIS sent you here.

41:05.895 --> 41:09.064
Well, the thing is, Hetty,
I don't have to answer you.

41:09.149 --> 41:10.332
Oh, I think you do.

41:11.368 --> 41:12.668
You brought Kallstrom in here.

41:12.736 --> 41:15.371
And that one is on me,
Agent Callen.

41:15.455 --> 41:17.623
And it may be enough to get you
not only out of our office,

41:17.690 --> 41:20.009
but maybe out of NCIS
completely.

41:20.076 --> 41:21.860
Don't threaten me.

41:23.330 --> 41:25.264
Are you trying
to bring down my team?

41:25.332 --> 41:29.001
Come on, Hetty, you know me.

41:29.052 --> 41:33.005
Oh, yes, I do.

41:33.056 --> 41:36.692
Are you trying
to bring down my team?

41:36.760 --> 41:38.744
No.

41:38.812 --> 41:39.845
Absolutely not.

41:39.896 --> 41:44.600
Your unit is one of
the best NCIS has.

41:44.684 --> 41:47.686
You know, there would've been
a time you would've trusted me.

41:47.737 --> 41:51.056
That was a very long time ago.

41:51.107 --> 41:53.575
Why are you here?

42:14.347 --> 42:17.099
I'm here to catch a killer.
