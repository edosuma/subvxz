01:30.291 --> 01:32.251
Man: Get out of the hole.
Get out of the hole now.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.233
On the ground.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.868
All the way on the ground.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.771
Where the hell did she go?

05:24.024 --> 05:26.558
Someone's gonna die tonight.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.327
Someone's gonna die tonight.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.661
Someone's gonna die tonight.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.363
Someone's gonna die tonight.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.764
Someone's gonna die tonight.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.399
Someone's gonna die tonight.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.401
Reporter: Halloween's
taken a dramatic turn

05:36.403 --> 05:38.670
since the Jaycees haunted houses
of old.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.506
Every year, haunt owners attempt
to go bigger and badder,

05:41.508 --> 05:44.743
in their words, more extreme.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.478
Well, enough is enough.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.013
As you remember, last Halloween,

05:48.015 --> 05:50.716
more than 24 million people
watched the live feed

05:50.718 --> 05:54.886
of a young woman struggling
for air inside a buried coffin.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.755
Thankfully,
the police intervened,

05:56.757 --> 05:59.424
and the distraught victim was
left on the side of the road.

05:59.426 --> 06:02.361
To this day, the case is still
a mystery if it was, in fact,

06:02.363 --> 06:05.630
a holiday stunt
or attempted murder.

06:05.632 --> 06:08.700
A roaming underground haunt
known as the blue skeleton

06:08.702 --> 06:11.002
posted the video
despite long-standing rumors

06:11.004 --> 06:13.472
their group was just
an urban legend.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.541
We thought that haunting night
was the end of this story,

06:16.543 --> 06:17.976
but these five thrill-seekers

06:17.978 --> 06:20.479
went back into
the heart of darkness.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.514
What happened just
this past hallows' Eve

06:22.516 --> 06:24.850
was far more violent
and far more tragic

06:24.852 --> 06:26.618
than anyone could have imagined.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.054
A haunted-house road trip
for these childhood friends

06:29.056 --> 06:31.556
came to a bloody conclusion
that will,

06:31.558 --> 06:34.926
without a doubt, change
the scare industry forever.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.166
Bobby: We have a shot
if you don't screw it up.

06:41.168 --> 06:44.936
You don't say...
Do not touch the word "extreme."

06:44.938 --> 06:46.738
No extreme haunts,

06:46.740 --> 06:48.407
- no buried alive.
- Okay.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.775
- Don't even...
- Obviously.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.743
Utter the word "blue."

06:51.745 --> 06:53.478
I just think
the word "haunted house"

06:53.480 --> 06:57.082
is going to make her not really
want to talk to us.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.985
Or maybe you
with the camera, also.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.020
Bobby: Say, "happy Halloween."
Knock on the door.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.623
Surprise!

07:08.095 --> 07:11.463
No.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.932
Zack: Happy Halloween?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.534
Whatever it is, no.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.169
Bobby: We're back!

07:17.171 --> 07:21.072
We got a little idea.
The game has changed.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.509
We just want to talk to you
for just like five minutes.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.645
Come join the gang again.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.115
Yes?

07:33.486 --> 07:34.753
Brandy: So, I mean,
I don't understand.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.588
Did they just, like,
have you come out

07:36.590 --> 07:37.923
and speak about haunted houses?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.825
To go to their haunts,

07:39.827 --> 07:42.093
and then we do marketing things
for them, and it's a big deal.

07:42.095 --> 07:45.597
They get to promote that coffin
girl is at their haunted house.

07:45.599 --> 07:46.798
Bobby: Though they're not
going to recognize you

07:46.800 --> 07:48.500
with that blond hair.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.968
That's not what
the people paid for.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.770
Yeah. Well

07:51.772 --> 07:54.172
I didn't want to be associated
with that anymore, so...

07:54.174 --> 07:58.143
Bobby: You have 24 million hits
on YouTube.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.912
- Yay.
- Your dad's not proud?

08:00.914 --> 08:03.582
Look, it's just not worth it.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.217
Bobby: Look, all they want to do
is we go out there.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.985
We rate it.
We go on social media.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.154
We say, "oh, thumbs-up.
This was a great haunt."

08:09.156 --> 08:11.122
That's all we have to do.
We roll through it.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.724
There's nothing extreme.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.125
They'll just be
different kind of haunts

08:14.127 --> 08:15.794
than we've ever done before.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.696
Brandy: I just don't know
why I have to go.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.764
Like, you guys can go.
You can do it.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.132
- Nobody cares...
- I'm not stopping you guys.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.934
Bobby:
Nobody cares about four guys.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.936
Like, they... they saw you.
They saw you in the coffin.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.606
You're coffin girl, whatever
the fuck that means now.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.074
That's who they want
at their haunt.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.209
I mean, I love you guys,
but I can't. I can't do it.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.910
Bobby: Mikey's going.
Jeff's going.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.913
- They already said they're in.
- Great! They can all go!

08:34.914 --> 08:36.648
They want...
They want all of us.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.017
That doesn't mean that I want
to go or I have to go.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.086
You don't <i> have</i> to go,
but you should <i> want</i> to go.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.587
It's... it's fun.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.589
It's doing it the right way
this time.

08:44.591 --> 08:45.857
We're getting paid.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.160
We're the haunted-house
aficionados now,

08:49.162 --> 08:51.963
and you're the celebrity draw,
coffin girl.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.665
Okay, money or no money,

08:53.667 --> 08:56.167
it's not gonna change
what happened the last time.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.136
Bobby: These are just different
kinds of haunts.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.971
It's not any of
the extreme shit, none of that.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.172
- That's what you say.
- They're not even...

09:01.174 --> 09:03.174
I ended up in the ground
last time, guys.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.910
I'm not doing it.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.645
Bobby: We had no idea
that was gonna happen.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.113
You know that.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.881
Okay, well, you have no idea
what's gonna happen

09:09.883 --> 09:12.584
this time, either,
so I'm not gonna do it.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.786
Bobby:
We have to have you.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.254
I'm not doing it.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.723
Zack:
Whatever.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.330
Bobby: Mikey.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.699
- Mike.
- What up?

09:27.701 --> 09:29.334
Bobby: Dude, we got to rethink
these first couple haunts

09:29.336 --> 09:30.936
without Brandy here.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.170
Um...

09:32.172 --> 09:34.673
World's most shocking
attraction?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.875
- What do you want to see?
- Titties.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.610
Adult content.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.712
Zack: Well, I'm gonna
do you one better

09:40.714 --> 09:43.615
because you got laser titties.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.766
Mikey: All right, so,
how do we get paid?

10:01.768 --> 10:04.869
Bobby: Show up, post pictures on
social media just like I said.

10:04.871 --> 10:07.005
It's easy money.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.050
Mikey: Zack, what's the name
of this one?

10:19.052 --> 10:21.786
Zack: Scream town,
eight different attractions.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.660
That's kind of funny.
Did you see that sign?

10:28.662 --> 10:31.396
Parking... 20 bucks, and then
in blood, it's written, "free."

10:31.398 --> 10:32.697
Mikey: Yeah.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.701
Welcome to scream town.

10:40.040 --> 10:44.342
<i>Help me.
Please help me!</i>

10:44.344 --> 10:46.011
Bobby: There's Zack not missing
a photo op.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.345
Man: You step back!

10:47.347 --> 10:49.114
Bobby: Tell him your phobia.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.082
Nah. See if they find it.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.051
- What is it, boy?
- Nah.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.153
- Tell me.
- Nope.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.388
Snakes.

10:56.390 --> 10:59.424
Go! Now! Get in there!
Go in there!

11:21.148 --> 11:23.014
Man: Hey, look.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.849
She's been here.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.118
Zack: We found some places
that cross the line.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.886
Is there anything
like that out here?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.321
We come to that line

12:03.323 --> 12:05.256
and try to get there
as closely as possible.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.892
I mean, we want people to be
terrified when they leave here.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.862
When we hear people are sobbing,
we like to hear that.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.363
Zack: Bobby, look at that sign.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.767
That is the guy from
the haunted house last night.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.469
- These people...
- Now I don't trust him.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.471
Zack: He's a magician.
No wonder he's up to no good.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.740
Mikey: Dual roles?
What the fuck?

12:21.742 --> 12:24.042
Bobby: That's amazing.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.177
Man: Paranoia quest.

12:28.482 --> 12:32.016
So we have here a few different
scenarios available for solving.

12:32.018 --> 12:35.286
We have our zombie apocalypse
where you have to find a cure

12:35.288 --> 12:38.356
from the zombies in order
to save the rest of the world.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.291
Zack: All right. Is there
anything else we should know

12:40.293 --> 12:41.860
before we go into this thing?

12:41.862 --> 12:43.928
Think about it this way.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.431
It's designed not to be
so much scary

12:46.433 --> 12:48.199
as actually to make it

12:48.201 --> 12:51.469
exciting and different
experience for you.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.272
- Put your hand on the thing.
- Put his handprint.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.407
We need a number.
Look, we need a code.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.844
Yeah, maybe you need
hand and code.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.379
All right.
The back of this is magnet,

13:01.381 --> 13:04.415
so it's stuck to...
It's stuck to metal somewhere.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.418
Oh, got it!

13:07.420 --> 13:08.853
Oh, it's the second half
of that.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.288
Okay. Look,
they're... they're...

13:10.290 --> 13:11.856
We need the first half
of this one

13:11.858 --> 13:13.958
and the second half
of this one. Look.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.160
Mike, what are you doing?

13:15.162 --> 13:17.061
Please.
The battery is out.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.297
14 is on the periodic table.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.900
One minute, then one minute,
then three minutes,

13:21.902 --> 13:24.135
then two minutes,
then two minutes.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.404
I'm pretty sure it's not
the Fibonacci sequence

13:26.406 --> 13:28.039
- to get out of here.
- Sweet.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.874
This is the thing we had to get.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.143
This unlocks this,
so now we need to use this.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.578
We can use it if we plug this

13:33.580 --> 13:35.280
into the battery thing
that was out there.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.347
It's the only thing I see.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.888
Put the battery in!

13:43.890 --> 13:46.057
Yes, I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!

13:50.063 --> 13:52.497
Female voice:
Authentification failed.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.566
Bobby:
Oh, they're gassing us.

13:54.568 --> 13:58.002
Female voice:
Authentification failed.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.938
Bobby:
Guess that means we lost.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.607
Female voice:
Authentification failed.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.475
- Hey, guys!
- Hey! Thank you.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.978
- That was a good time, man.
- Hey, Zack.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.047
So how did you like our
"escape the room" experience?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.415
That was cool.
That was different.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.083
You promised us
something original.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.451
- Cool.
- And we got it.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.019
Well, listen, I have
been around the world

14:15.021 --> 14:17.589
and to some crazy places,
and I can tell you

14:17.591 --> 14:19.624
if you're looking
for something extreme,

14:19.626 --> 14:22.393
something crazy,
seek out hellbent.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.495
Seek out hellbent?

14:24.497 --> 14:26.998
Yeah, you're right.
Seek out hellbent.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.333
Hellbent. Seek out hellbent.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.601
- All right. Will do.
- All right, cool.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.236
- Appreciate it.
- All right. Awesome.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.403
Bobby: All right.
It was nice meeting you, man.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.538
- I appreciate it.
- Absolutely.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.440
Bobby:
Thanks for having us.

14:35.442 --> 14:39.143
Hey, by the way,
when a Russian tells you

14:39.145 --> 14:41.045
to seek out something,
you don't do it.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.480
When a Russian says
he's been all around the world

14:42.482 --> 14:44.148
- and seen some crazy shit...
- Yeah.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.917
You don't go where he says.

14:45.919 --> 14:49.320
Just as I do at all the haunts,
picked up my t-shirt.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.655
Bobby: You can't get
a t-shirt from here.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.957
You lost. We lost.
We're fucking losers.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.592
I experienced it, though.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.462
Bobby: Not experience.
You have to <i> finish</i> the haunt.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.063
You lost.
Loser.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.365
Brains.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.666
Bobby: Yeah.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.435
- Not worthy of the shirt.
- Nope.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.304
Bobby: So apparently
they shut this place down,

15:06.306 --> 15:08.006
like, in the 1800s.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.407
For what?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.975
Bobby:
For putting, like, animal parts

15:10.977 --> 15:14.145
and pieces of kids
in their soap.

15:14.147 --> 15:17.115
Pretty fucked up if it's true.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.018
Just makes for
a better haunted house.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.697
Say "uncle" loudly and clearly,
uncle,

15:32.699 --> 15:35.300
and someone will come
and take you back upstairs

15:35.302 --> 15:37.268
where it is warm and safe.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.547
Oh, look at this!

15:49.549 --> 15:51.549
Bring back memories, Mikey?

15:54.154 --> 15:56.054
Been in one of these before.

15:56.056 --> 15:59.724
Aah! Aaaah!

16:05.598 --> 16:07.532
"Twin peaks" mode.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.071
Nah, I'm good.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.515
- Wait. He... he says
that I'm to go, Bobby.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.984
- Go!

17:24.077 --> 17:25.076
What?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.045
All right.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.213
Eat her.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.681
He's coming.

17:30.683 --> 17:36.054
But your child is great
for your mind.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.593
Get it out!

17:42.595 --> 17:47.398
What the fuck?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.634
No. No.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.502
Stop that!

18:11.424 --> 18:14.092
Zack: What do you smell?
What do you smell?

18:16.162 --> 18:17.562
Let's go.
Come on.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.500
Zack: If you guys can't handle that,
you have no shot in Minneapolis.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.671
What did you think
of the soap factory?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.806
Dude, that's one of the best
ones I've been into.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.741
It's a totally different feel.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.510
Well, I mean, literally feel
because they can touch you.

18:32.512 --> 18:33.744
They're not, like, hurting you,

18:33.746 --> 18:35.213
but they're really,
really creepy.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.414
Zack: Did they touch you
in no-no places?

18:36.416 --> 18:38.616
No. Well, my beard
is a no-no place,

18:38.618 --> 18:40.685
and a guy with, like,
a doctor's leather glove

18:40.687 --> 18:42.487
was just slowly
caressing my beard,

18:42.489 --> 18:44.555
and then he... then he made me
dance with him.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.779
We went to an art-gallery
haunted house,

19:08.781 --> 19:10.648
and you didn't come.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.351
They put me in a box, Brandy.
You wouldn't have liked that.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.786
I don't know why you guys
can't say something like,

19:15.788 --> 19:19.590
"hey, let's go
to a tropical island,"

19:19.592 --> 19:21.459
or, "let's go to Europe."

19:21.461 --> 19:23.661
Instead, you want
to go to Minnesota.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.695
I'm not doing it.

19:27.433 --> 19:30.835
Bobby: There he is, the man,
the myth, the legend.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.538
So we've been here for two days.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.206
You've missed three haunts

19:35.208 --> 19:37.475
because you wanted
to take a bus.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.743
Yeah, I'm a country boy!

19:38.745 --> 19:40.645
I've got to get
my sights in, dude!

19:43.616 --> 19:45.683
- You got some making up to do.
- I'm gonna make up for it.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.652
- I got a rap ready.
- Oh, Jesus.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.854
So we're gonna learn about
killer clowns this time around.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.656
- It's gonna be awesome.
- So we're gonna...

19:51.658 --> 19:53.491
- You're gonna rap for me?
- No, I...

19:53.493 --> 19:55.293
Bobby: We wrapped a gift for you.
We have a present.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.661
Oh, you wrapped a gift.
Okay.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.962
- You're gonna love it.
- Play on words.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.564
- Yes.
- You're serious?

19:59.566 --> 20:00.932
- You got me a gift?
- I got you a gift.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.833
Thought you were just...
Fucking around.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.735
- Right now for you.
- All right.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.337
I mean,
you did take the bus here.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.905
You deserve some kind
of consolation prize.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.608
You're right. You're right.
Thank you for that.

20:12.778 --> 20:17.715
Oh, wow! Halloween
wrapping paper, huh?

20:17.717 --> 20:18.883
Can I open it?

20:18.885 --> 20:22.687
Zack:
Nope. Just look at it.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.989
Jeff: All right. I'm gonna
ravage this thing.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.558
Box cutter would have been nice.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.795
Bobby: You're complaining
about your gift?

20:30.797 --> 20:32.997
I know.
Holy shit.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.233
- Shut up.
- Mm-hmm.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.768
Bobby: We're gonna take that
through every haunt we go through.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.605
Oh, my god.
This is so...

20:40.607 --> 20:42.340
Dude, I've been
practicing at home

20:42.342 --> 20:44.008
with, like, a little mini one.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.943
- No, this is the real deal.
- This is really...

20:45.945 --> 20:47.411
No, thank you very much.
This is awesome.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.280
I can't believe
you guys did this.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.915
Bobby: All right. Charge it up
and let's take it for a spin.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.917
Got it. Thank you.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.828
Okay.
I'll let you know.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.630
All right.
Thanks.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.365
I knew that would happen.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.300
They don't even want us to come
if Brandy's not with us.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.535
Bobby: God damn it.

21:11.537 --> 21:13.771
Zack: They're paying double
what the other places paid,

21:13.773 --> 21:16.540
and he basically canceled.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.476
Bobby:
So he said, "no girl..."

21:18.478 --> 21:20.278
He said, "don't even bother
coming if we don't have Brandy."

21:20.280 --> 21:21.712
Bobby: What did I tell you?

21:21.714 --> 21:23.714
Nobody gives a shit
about four guys coming in.

21:23.716 --> 21:27.451
You know why they even called us
in the first place is about her.

21:29.388 --> 21:31.522
She has got to come.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.823
I-I'll talk to her again
tonight.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.458
Zack: It's a hayride.
It's that easy.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.660
I will talk to her again.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.927
We've already expressed that she

21:36.929 --> 21:38.529
doesn't have to do
extreme haunts,

21:38.531 --> 21:39.864
and these haunts,
she doesn't to have to do it.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.500
It's just gonna be fun,
easy shit.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.001
Mike's got to go back.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.337
He's got to go get the Gopros
anyway tomorrow morning.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.873
He goes back. If we can convince
her, even get her close,

21:48.875 --> 21:51.075
he can go seal the deal
and bring her back.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.810
Pays double, so...

21:52.812 --> 21:53.978
- Great.
- It'll be fine.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.446
I've known her the longest.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.847
It's not gonna be
that hard when I'm there.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.716
On the phone, it's tough,
but, I mean, she'll come.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.084
- She knows that she has fun.
- It's easy we get her here...

22:00.086 --> 22:01.485
We get her here for one haunt,

22:01.487 --> 22:02.953
you know she's not
gonna go home.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.522
Zack: Are other places
just gonna do this?

22:04.524 --> 22:06.090
Yes, they do not want to see us.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.692
I told you that
from the beginning.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.694
We get her here, we're good.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.564
Hey, brand.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.966
This is my last-ditch effort
to get you out here.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.602
Zack's lined up all this stuff,
and it's falling apart.

22:18.604 --> 22:21.405
He's just freaking out.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.973
He's bit off more
than he can chew.

22:22.975 --> 22:26.077
And I know he needs the money.
We just need your help.

22:26.079 --> 22:28.813
He lined up a doctor for you
to set your mind at ease.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.715
She specializes in fear.

22:30.717 --> 22:31.949
We need you.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.855
Bobby: Are you happy to be back
in the saddle again?

22:37.857 --> 22:40.591
Dude, I'm loving it, man.
I had such a blast last time.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.694
I'm just so ready to get back
at it and just kind of...

22:43.696 --> 22:45.429
I know there's so many places
we haven't been.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.732
- I know we just started, so...
- I like that attitude.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.000
He gets drug through an alley,
and he likes it.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.937
Bobby: How did you end up in
the alley in the first place?

22:52.939 --> 22:55.005
I thought I was following you.

22:55.007 --> 22:58.109
Like, it was your hoodie,
your height.

22:58.111 --> 23:00.144
I was shouting at you.
I know it was loud as hell.

23:00.146 --> 23:03.114
Everyone had masks on.
But...

23:03.116 --> 23:04.815
And you just kept ignoring me,
kept walking.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.751
Next thing I know,
there's five hillbilly assholes

23:06.753 --> 23:10.521
coming after me, and they
dragged my ass down the alley.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.826
Yeah, but, I mean, like,
that didn't feel fake.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.461
You weren't there.
It didn't...

23:17.463 --> 23:19.130
It felt like I couldn't breathe.

23:19.132 --> 23:22.600
Like, I just thought
I was gonna die.

23:22.602 --> 23:25.803
Mikey: But you didn't die.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.772
Think about it. It's like
they said in "fight club."

23:27.774 --> 23:30.408
Your breakfast never tasted
better the next morning.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.510
- Right?
- I don't eat breakfast.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.078
Mikey: Jesus Christ, Brandy.
Lunch, whatever.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.881
I'm trying to console you.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.149
I know. I get it.

23:38.151 --> 23:39.850
It's just, you know,

23:39.852 --> 23:42.119
and obviously I do this
because I love you guys,

23:42.121 --> 23:45.723
but, you know, it's just crazy
the things I do for you

23:45.725 --> 23:47.124
and your brother and Zack.

23:48.193 --> 23:51.562
Mikey: Well,
it's that big of a deal.

23:51.564 --> 23:54.665
We're getting paid this time.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.067
I know you need the money.
You know sure as shit I do.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.937
Anyways, so the good news is

23:59.939 --> 24:02.673
there's going to be a zombie
run, so that'll be fun.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.508
Mikey: We have to run?

24:04.510 --> 24:07.445
I can't believe
she actually came.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.913
She made it.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.848
Not sure how Mikey
got her to come, but...

24:10.850 --> 24:13.584
Who cares?
She's here.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.686
Look who's back!

24:15.688 --> 24:17.955
Ready for Halloween
adventures, part two?

24:17.957 --> 24:19.657
Excited?

24:19.659 --> 24:22.626
Yep.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.762
What's up, kids?

24:24.764 --> 24:27.731
Can't believe you convinced me
to do it again, but...

24:27.733 --> 24:32.870
Zack: That's not that smile on the
Brandy face we were looking for.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.039
Boop.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.875
Bobby: We were scared, too.
I'm not saying that we weren't.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.977
I mean,
they put us in the ground.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.545
I get it.
I didn't...

24:41.547 --> 24:43.147
There was half of me
that just didn't know

24:43.149 --> 24:47.151
what was gonna happen next,
and I hope that you just...

24:47.153 --> 24:48.752
Nothing happened,
so we got over it,

24:48.754 --> 24:50.554
and here we are again.

24:50.556 --> 24:52.723
Brandy: Yeah, but everybody
handles things differently.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.124
So...

24:54.126 --> 24:57.261
- That's fine.
- Zack is always right, though.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.896
This is all part of the haunt.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.965
Nothing's gonna happen.
We're not gonna get hurt.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.800
As much bullshit
as that sounded like,

25:02.802 --> 25:04.735
it actually turned out be true.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.136
Yeah, I mean,
it's like when you know

25:06.138 --> 25:08.239
something's good for you to do,

25:08.241 --> 25:11.108
but you don't necessarily want
to have to go through it.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.010
Bobby: Do you know where
she's taking you,

25:13.012 --> 25:14.745
where we're going
right now, though?

25:14.747 --> 25:16.180
Brandy: No.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.816
Bobby: So she wants to talk
to you in a, uh...

25:18.818 --> 25:22.520
I don't know if it's an old
prison or something like that,

25:22.522 --> 25:24.722
these grounds that she works at
because she...

25:24.724 --> 25:27.291
She sometimes...
She wires people.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.593
She captures heart rates,

25:29.595 --> 25:31.128
stuff like that, sends people
through haunted houses.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.030
Like, she's actually
done studies,

25:33.032 --> 25:34.865
scientific studies
that she's done that.

25:34.867 --> 25:38.536
So she sends them through
these old prisons in the dark

25:38.538 --> 25:40.771
and then just kind of takes
all the data she can.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.073
And, I mean, I think that's part
of why she wrote that book.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.776
I'm just saying.
Like, you don't...

25:45.778 --> 25:47.545
Like, if I was like,
"hey, guess what.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.779
You have this really big thing

25:48.781 --> 25:50.180
that happened to you
in your life,

25:50.182 --> 25:54.051
and you're kind of
tormented about it.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.287
Now, we're gonna sit there
and look at your inner,

25:56.289 --> 25:58.122
deepest thoughts,
and we're gonna record it."

25:58.124 --> 26:01.191
And why does every reality show
that exists on the planet,

26:01.193 --> 26:02.660
there's a confessional booth?

26:02.662 --> 26:04.028
'Cause that's what people
want to hear.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.130
Brandy: Great.
Those people chose to do it.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.065
- I'm not.
- You're choosing to do it.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.700
Brandy:
I'm choosing to do that,

26:09.702 --> 26:12.670
but I don't have to choose
to allow you to film me.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.338
- It is kind of dickish.
- I won't film...

26:14.340 --> 26:16.273
- Thank you, Jeff.
- Hey, pipe down, peanut gallery.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.275
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.778
Brandy: What do you want me to say?
You want me to say yes?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.212
I'll think about it.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.781
Zack: That's my favorite answer
you give.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.816
"I'll think about it."

26:25.818 --> 26:31.188
Because no means no, but
"I think about it" means yes.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.823
Brandy: I mean, how did you
get into this?

26:32.825 --> 26:35.025
Like, because I'm trying
to get out of this.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.828
And you immerse
yourself in it, you know.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.864
Well, I've always really
liked being scared,

26:40.866 --> 26:45.970
but, of course, you know, fear,
true trauma is awful.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.305
But there are a lot of ways
that we can enjoy it

26:48.307 --> 26:50.240
and a lot of ways
that we can grow from it,

26:50.242 --> 26:52.710
so I really wanted to try
and figure out, you know,

26:52.712 --> 26:55.813
how we can engage
with scary things in a way

26:55.815 --> 26:58.716
that will make us feel good
and will even help us grow.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.117
- Mm-hmm
- so I just...

27:00.119 --> 27:02.853
I've been studying fear
and voluntary engagement

27:02.855 --> 27:05.990
with negative high-arousal
stimuli, as we say...

27:05.992 --> 27:07.858
Brandy: What was that?

27:07.860 --> 27:12.363
For the past 10 years or so
and looking at the boundaries

27:12.365 --> 27:17.134
between when fear is fun
and when fear is traumatizing.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.870
So how many attractions
have you been to?

27:19.872 --> 27:21.071
I mean, I don't
even know anymore.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.806
Maybe like 50.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.808
- Wow. That's a lot.
- Yeah.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.211
It's really hard
not having free will...

27:27.213 --> 27:29.246
- Right.
- You know, and not being able

27:29.248 --> 27:32.383
to tap out when you want to.

27:32.385 --> 27:36.286
I didn't know if I was gonna die
or if they were gonna stop

27:36.288 --> 27:37.855
and come out and laugh at me.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.390
- Right.
- You know?

27:39.392 --> 27:42.393
So for me, like, that's always
been the hardest part is,

27:42.395 --> 27:45.429
who knows what would have
happened if, you know,

27:45.431 --> 27:46.997
if the police didn't come?

27:46.999 --> 27:49.033
These people that
I've cared about so much

27:49.035 --> 27:50.901
and that are so close to me

27:50.903 --> 27:54.004
would put me in any situation
that...

27:54.006 --> 27:57.775
I mean, they couldn't have
known, but I was just angry.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.877
You know, it was a lot of anger.

27:59.879 --> 28:03.180
And they just want to keep going
to these and going to these,

28:03.182 --> 28:06.183
and we have so many more,
and they don't...

28:06.185 --> 28:09.887
They can't even comprehend
what I'm feeling.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.321
- Right.
- So they don't...

28:11.323 --> 28:13.123
It's just...
It's not the same for them.

28:13.125 --> 28:16.960
Right. It never became real
for them the way it did for you.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.462
- That's the scary part is...
- Yeah.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.898
Knowing whether you can
trust your friends and,

28:20.900 --> 28:22.966
you know, knowing that
your friends have your back

28:22.968 --> 28:26.336
and are not trying
to pull one over but, you know,

28:26.338 --> 28:28.405
be there with you
for the experience

28:28.407 --> 28:32.209
instead of making you
the experience.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.778
Can you see a scenario
where, you know,

28:34.780 --> 28:36.480
going through these attractions
might be a way

28:36.482 --> 28:39.783
to not really get back at them,

28:39.785 --> 28:42.186
but kind of reclaim it
for yourself, you know,

28:42.188 --> 28:45.355
to do it for yourself
despite them,

28:45.357 --> 28:49.159
you know, to kind of say,
"no, I want to do this

28:49.161 --> 28:51.929
and recapture the fun
that I used to have"?

28:51.931 --> 28:53.397
Do you think that's something...

28:53.399 --> 28:56.100
Have you ever tried
reminding yourself that,

28:56.102 --> 28:57.935
"everything in this
environment is fake.

28:57.937 --> 29:01.305
I know nothing is really
going to hurt me.

29:01.307 --> 29:05.342
You know, this is something
that is supposed to be fun."

29:05.344 --> 29:07.144
Brandy:
I want to say that I can,

29:07.146 --> 29:10.347
but every time I go through one
of these haunted houses,

29:10.349 --> 29:13.050
I just... I'm taken back.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.415
Here it goes.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.490
Mikey: Halloween would not be
the same without you.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.893
- Yeah, well, we'll see.
- This is...

29:55.895 --> 29:58.095
I'm having second thoughts
already.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.897
- We got a drone.
- Do I get a beer?

29:59.899 --> 30:02.466
It's not a beer.
This is absinthe.

30:02.468 --> 30:06.069
All right.
Did that like a man.

30:06.071 --> 30:07.271
- Man.
- That was good, sir.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.839
Thank you.
Look at the alcohol...

30:08.841 --> 30:10.574
Look at the alcohol content.

30:10.576 --> 30:14.044
- Mikey is gonna get a little...
- 66.6%.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.880
Michael's got a special,
I'll call it an outfit,

30:16.882 --> 30:18.215
coming his way.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.550
Jeff: I don't know, Zack.

30:19.552 --> 30:21.451
Should I really be
drinking and droning?

30:21.453 --> 30:23.387
- That's a little unsafe.
- Drinking and...

30:23.389 --> 30:25.389
- Drinking and droning?
- Drinking and droning, bro.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.291
- It's a little unsafe.
- That's good.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.393
Is this really gonna
put hair on my chest?

30:29.395 --> 30:31.128
Bobby: No. Nothing will.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.332
No crazy stuff.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.334
- Like this?
- We told you that before.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.436
Okay. Zack, I'm being serious.

30:39.438 --> 30:42.439
Brandy, we are going
on a hayride.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.374
- It's a haunted hayride.
- Yeah, but it's a hayride.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.343
- Whoo.
- It's not crazy.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.378
Brandy:
Okay. I'm serious.

30:48.380 --> 30:52.049
Man: Anoka, Minnesota, is the
Halloween capital of the world.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.851
Man: You guys got good
haunted houses up there?

30:53.853 --> 30:56.220
- That I could not tell you.
- All right.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.956
They're known as the Halloween
capital of the world.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.624
As to why they're known
as that, I don't know.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.259
Maybe they were the ones
that started it.

31:02.261 --> 31:03.627
Man:
We need to find out.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.362
You're on main, Mike.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.930
I'm gonna make a right here.

31:06.932 --> 31:10.500
We are on main street
of Anoka, Minnesota.

31:10.502 --> 31:14.204
Supposedly, this is the
Halloween capital of the world.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.107
We're trying to figure
that out, though.

31:17.109 --> 31:21.211
I think maybe
we should ask a local.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.613
Oh, there's a skeleton.

31:22.615 --> 31:25.515
Let's get right over here.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.218
- This is Halloween in the city.
- Yeah. Look at that guy.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.420
Zack: What does it say?
"I survived."

31:33.057 --> 31:35.626
Mikey: Ah, these old people,
they've been here for a long time.

31:35.628 --> 31:37.594
I bet they know.
Let's ask them.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.263
- How are you?
- Hi!

31:39.265 --> 31:40.898
How are you?
Who are you?

31:40.900 --> 31:42.432
Mikey:
We're just roaming around

31:42.434 --> 31:44.434
looking for the best Halloween
towns and haunted houses.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.637
Oh, this is a great one.

31:46.639 --> 31:48.505
They started trick-or-treating
in this town.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.274
- Yeah.
- Can you tell us that?

31:50.276 --> 31:52.542
- Thank you for the answer.
- This guy knows the answer.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.678
- The reason this is...
- Who are you guys?

31:54.680 --> 31:57.915
We're filming about haunted
houses and Halloween and things.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.316
- Oh! Oh, yeah. Okay.
- So tell us.

31:59.318 --> 32:02.019
This is the Halloween
capital of the world.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.620
Why is that?

32:03.622 --> 32:05.389
How did you find it?
That's the main question.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.291
- We googled it.
- No. No.

32:07.293 --> 32:11.995
The reason is that they started
trick-or-treating here.

32:11.997 --> 32:13.497
How so?

32:13.499 --> 32:17.701
And rather than the kids
pushing over, like, bathrooms

32:17.703 --> 32:20.704
and outdoors and, you know, eggs
and throwing stuff all around...

32:20.706 --> 32:22.205
Well, they used to
tip over garbage cans.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.041
Community thought
it would be good,

32:24.043 --> 32:25.309
so they started
trick-or-treating.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.044
So they said,
"why don't these kids,

32:27.046 --> 32:28.345
- instead of doing bad things..."
- This is a lovely town.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.414
Anoka, Halloween
capital of the world.

32:33.419 --> 32:37.054
Zack: Do you think Brandy has any
idea we're going to an r-rated haunt?

32:37.056 --> 32:39.356
Nope, that's the best part.

32:39.358 --> 32:42.059
I think there's a dog in there.

32:52.271 --> 32:55.339
Only we would find the Halloween
capital of the world

32:55.341 --> 32:57.341
in the middle of nowhere.

33:00.346 --> 33:03.647
Dead end, Brandy.
I say it's foreshadowing.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.583
Mm. I love foreshadowing.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.720
Ooh, a thrift store.

33:09.722 --> 33:11.989
I'm just happy because
I feel like this is,

33:11.991 --> 33:15.225
like, the kids' version
of Halloween.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.361
Yep. We're going
on the kid version.

33:17.363 --> 33:18.729
We haven't done a haunted
hayride yet, have we?

33:18.731 --> 33:20.263
Nope.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.985
I don't understand
how it can be that scary.

33:23.235 --> 33:26.503
Well, after what we've seen,
I have no idea.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.272
Mikey: I'm just saying.
I don't know how it's that scary

33:29.274 --> 33:32.476
when you're all bundled up
together in the back of a truck.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.044
It's freezing.

33:34.046 --> 33:36.279
Well, I mean,
he's paying us to come out here.

33:36.281 --> 33:37.647
- I'm fine with it.
- It's a hayride, though.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.216
How scary is it gonna be?

33:39.218 --> 33:40.550
I'll get paid to do
any hayride possible.

33:40.552 --> 33:41.785
This sounds great.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.086
And I'm completely fine
with that.

33:43.088 --> 33:44.454
This is farm boy's place.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.689
Jeff: I thought it was gonna
be a little tame,

33:45.691 --> 33:47.257
but by the scare...
The scream...

33:47.259 --> 33:49.292
Jeff, did you take hayrides
on your farm?

33:49.294 --> 33:50.761
- Hey, Zack?
- Yes!

33:50.763 --> 33:53.063
Glad you could make it out
on such short notice.

33:53.065 --> 33:54.731
- Yeah, man!
- Thanks for coming out!

33:54.733 --> 33:58.235
Yeah, no problem. This looks
cool by the sounds I'm hearing.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.070
We're sitting
on about 160 acres.

34:00.072 --> 34:03.573
We border... we border about
10,000 acres of game reserve.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.809
So when we bury
you guys out there,

34:05.811 --> 34:06.743
nobody will be able to find you.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.478
Don't... don't say that.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.380
I told her.
I said, "it's just a hayride!"

34:11.382 --> 34:13.216
Yeah, it's just a hayride.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.385
The guys, you pay us
a couple hundred bucks,

34:15.387 --> 34:17.353
the guys are down,
but the girl...

34:17.356 --> 34:18.789
- Not so much.
- I'm not going back in there.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.424
- A little skittish.
- Yeah.

34:20.426 --> 34:21.558
Well, let's go!
Let's head up to the entrance.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.826
Yeah, where's the entrance?

34:42.380 --> 34:44.081
Bobby:
There's 3,000 people there.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.315
I mean, they've got
to have something to do.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.217
How do you compare yourself
to some of the other haunts,

34:48.219 --> 34:50.719
some of the other crazy stuff
people are doing?

34:50.722 --> 34:53.290
You know, we're not...
I know that some of the...

34:53.292 --> 34:56.693
Kind of one of the trends
would be to go as extreme

34:56.695 --> 34:59.262
as you possibly can,
some blue skeleton.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.664
That's not really
what we're about.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.266
We try and straddle
the razor's edge

35:03.268 --> 35:05.202
between family-friendly

35:05.204 --> 35:08.271
and still entertaining
for the 21-plus crowd.

35:08.273 --> 35:12.609
So we're edgy, but I wouldn't
say we're over-the-top extreme.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.344
Man: What have you heard about
some of the extreme haunts,

35:14.346 --> 35:15.745
like, up in the north?

35:15.747 --> 35:17.314
Because it's kind of
our first time up here.

35:17.316 --> 35:20.117
What have you heard
that people are doing?

35:20.119 --> 35:23.186
Stealing peoples' shoes,
putting them in coffins,

35:23.188 --> 35:25.489
driving them around
and then just leaving them,

35:25.491 --> 35:28.558
and they're, like, maybe
a half-mile away from the haunt,

35:28.560 --> 35:31.695
and they have no clue
how to get back.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.797
You know, put bags
over your heads,

35:33.799 --> 35:35.866
spray that bag with water,

35:35.868 --> 35:38.368
make it kind of hard to breathe.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.636
Man: They're waterboarding
people now?

35:39.638 --> 35:42.172
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Wow.

35:42.174 --> 35:43.607
Anything to get a scare, right?

35:43.609 --> 35:45.175
Man: I hear you on that.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.522
So we want to do that stuff.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.390
Like, we actually...
I want to know.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.259
Where should we go?

36:02.261 --> 36:05.262
Try the corn maze down there.
That's a pretty awesome show.

36:05.264 --> 36:06.930
Where is that from here?

36:06.932 --> 36:10.800
It's out towards
exit 99 off of I-5,

36:10.802 --> 36:13.403
real close to that, 93rd street.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.505
Is it extreme, though?
Like...

36:15.507 --> 36:17.274
I wouldn't call it extreme.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.543
Because I've got people
with me that are, like...

36:19.545 --> 36:21.811
I want the craziest place
you can think of.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.181
Man: You don't have people with you.
You want to go, dickhead.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.550
Well, no. I want to go,
but some people,

36:26.552 --> 36:28.919
Mikey and Brandy,
might not be able to take it.

36:28.921 --> 36:30.854
But we're still going...
We want to push them to the edge

36:30.856 --> 36:32.622
if you know what I mean.

36:32.624 --> 36:35.692
Well, I don't know that
that's "push it to the edge."

36:35.694 --> 36:39.896
The only place I know of is
you want to seek out hellbent.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.332
That will push you
to the very edge.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.301
- Hellbent.
- Hellbent.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.670
All right.
I know you're down.

36:46.672 --> 36:49.272
Man: That's the second time
we've been told that.

36:49.274 --> 36:50.607
Where'd you hear about hellbent?

36:50.609 --> 36:52.375
You hear about it
everywhere in the network,

36:52.377 --> 36:54.644
- the haunted-house network.
- See?

36:54.646 --> 36:56.313
That's what everybody's
talking about.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.380
Exactly.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.282
Get you guys up to the front.

36:59.284 --> 37:00.450
So are you guys ready
to do this?

37:00.452 --> 37:01.785
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.920
This is benefits
of being put in a coffin.

37:13.799 --> 37:14.931
Ah!

37:14.933 --> 37:17.601
- Oh, my god!
- It's vibrating!

37:17.603 --> 37:20.503
I can't take it!
Oh, my god!

37:20.505 --> 37:22.706
They are gonna get on.

37:24.543 --> 37:27.510
House and now we're putting
you through a haunted house.

37:27.512 --> 37:32.782
No. Technically, it's a hayride,
zombie 5k,

37:32.784 --> 37:35.385
and a zombie pub crawl,
not haunted houses.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.720
- Fair?
- Yeah.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.622
- Stay true to our word.
- Yep.

37:38.624 --> 37:41.758
Yeah, you didn't go
to soapbox... the soap factory.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.894
Yeah, we go to an art-exhibit
haunted house,

37:44.896 --> 37:45.962
and you're not there.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.531
Brandy: No.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.734
Jeff, what kind of barn is this?

37:52.337 --> 37:53.703
- Aah!
- Christ!

37:53.705 --> 37:55.272
Oh, god!

37:55.274 --> 37:59.709
This is definitely
a special kind of barn.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.711
Oh, that feels lovely, though.

38:18.397 --> 38:21.798
You smell different
when you're awake!

38:25.070 --> 38:26.936
That's a new line.
I like that.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.872
Oh, look, it's like a catacomb.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.040
Brandy:
Oh, god. Oh, god.

38:30.042 --> 38:31.474
- I don't see anybody.
- Oh!

38:31.476 --> 38:32.796
That guy just went
on my shoulder!

38:37.048 --> 38:39.582
Aah!

38:41.420 --> 38:44.554
- Oh, god.

38:46.757 --> 38:49.359
Zack: They can't even... they're
doing better than they are!

38:49.361 --> 38:51.695
They're jumping
out of the front!

38:51.697 --> 38:53.930
Oh, guy just rolled.
Jeff, did you see that?

38:53.932 --> 38:57.634
That guy rolled off the back!

38:57.636 --> 38:59.803
Got to move him up. Should I
say, "Jeff, change with me"?

38:59.805 --> 39:02.372
That chainsaw touching you
like that is...

39:02.374 --> 39:04.741
- Chain on it.
- Yeah.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.810
Brandy, there's your...
There's your out.

39:06.812 --> 39:09.713
- There's the RV.
- Home sweet home.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.948
Zack: Couldn't be too far
from civilization.

39:11.950 --> 39:15.585
Oh, my god!

39:19.124 --> 39:21.758
Woman: Have fun!
Just watch your step!

39:21.760 --> 39:24.794
Ohh.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.364
Zack: See, Brandy?
Easiest money you've ever made.

39:34.406 --> 39:36.773
- Aah!
- What the fuck?

39:36.775 --> 39:39.609
- Ow! Ow!
- Hey, guys, wait up!

39:42.013 --> 39:43.613
Guys, wait up!

40:04.503 --> 40:06.703
That clown,
when people were like,

40:06.705 --> 40:08.605
"oh, my god,
I recognize you!"

40:08.607 --> 40:11.741
Was like, "oh, shit, you caught
me on 'to catch a predator.'"

40:11.743 --> 40:13.443
oh, yeah.

40:13.445 --> 40:16.746
- Yeah!
- Oh, you g... oh.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.581
- That was important to us.
- You guys are amazing.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.551
I fricking love you guys.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.753
- Yeah?
- Oh. Thank you guys so much.

40:23.755 --> 40:24.888
What was your name?
What was your name?

40:24.890 --> 40:26.189
- Clicks.
- Clicks. Mikey.

40:26.191 --> 40:27.757
- Nice to meet you.
- You made our night.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.025
You made our night.
I mean it, man.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.593
You guys made my night,
like, seriously.

40:30.595 --> 40:31.995
I love you guys.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.696
All right.
Thanks, man.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.972
Zack:
Dude, let's go to that haunt.

40:42.974 --> 40:46.042
Brandy: No. I'm not doing
haunted houses.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.211
Jeff, you got 6.7 miles,

40:48.213 --> 40:51.514
and then you stay on it here
to fearing.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.458
Man:
Whoa! Was that a pumpkin?

41:07.165 --> 41:08.865
Have you ever done
the zombie pub crawl?

41:08.867 --> 41:10.967
I have. It's actually
on that newspaper there.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.036
- A few years ago, I made...
- Oh, nice, got in the paper.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.737
Woman:
Yeah, I made the paper.

41:14.739 --> 41:17.106
I have to eat in the zombie
brains-eating contest.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.050
- Brandy, you're up!
- Now, it's just, like,

41:27.052 --> 41:29.018
an inside joke
between my friends and I.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.854
I was like...

41:30.856 --> 41:33.690
I should probably shut my mouth
when that's coming my way.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.965
Man: Bobby, are you eating
in the contest?

41:41.967 --> 41:43.800
You can eat with that on, too?

41:43.802 --> 41:45.568
Yeah.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.237
Kobayashi is going to
kick our ass,

41:47.239 --> 41:48.771
so it doesn't really matter.

41:48.773 --> 41:50.206
Man: I know,
but it doesn't matter, dude.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.975
It's about how you look.

41:51.977 --> 41:56.246
He's 120 pounds, and you're
still not a threat to him.

41:56.248 --> 41:58.748
That's gross, which is awesome.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.917
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

42:00.919 --> 42:03.553
I'm was smiling. I was just
doing my growl in the picture,

42:03.555 --> 42:04.921
and I'm like, "cool."

42:04.923 --> 42:06.256
Is that the outfit
you're wearing?

42:06.258 --> 42:07.857
That's a good outfit for it.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.292
- You're probably...
- I got something...

42:09.294 --> 42:12.128
- It's getting to where...
- Sorry.

42:19.004 --> 42:23.172
Bobby: Mike, get your suit on.
Zombie pub crawl, next exit.

42:26.778 --> 42:33.116
The brain-eating championship
is at Gluek's in the...

42:33.118 --> 42:35.251
Where are we now?

42:35.253 --> 42:38.821
- Dude, are those intestines?
- I'm taking Brandy's job over.

42:38.823 --> 42:40.890
Here we are.

42:40.892 --> 42:43.159
What are you
wearing tonight, Michael?

43:05.317 --> 43:08.117
Man:
Zack, we got to post this.

43:26.103 --> 43:27.904
- It's working.
- I killed...

43:27.906 --> 43:30.373
- I killed my husband tonight.
- That's terrible.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.275
Bobby, what time?

43:32.277 --> 43:35.945
How are you enjoying your time
at the zombie pub crawl?

43:58.970 --> 44:00.703
Man: Give me that!

44:08.179 --> 44:11.247
We got brain tacos, people,

44:11.249 --> 44:14.817
a recipe made by our friend
Andrew Zimmern.

44:15.854 --> 44:17.754
The record for most ever eaten

44:17.756 --> 44:19.822
was 54 by Joey Chestnut.

44:19.824 --> 44:23.059
I hope to see that
blown away tonight.

44:23.061 --> 44:25.061
We have two brothers
here tonight.

44:25.063 --> 44:28.965
Put your hands together
for Mr. Bobby roe!

44:32.303 --> 44:34.937
There he is.

44:34.939 --> 44:39.709
Put your hands together
for Mikey roe!

44:39.711 --> 44:44.180
And he's the sharpest-dressed
man here today.

44:44.182 --> 44:47.817
Look at this handsome,
handsome man!

44:47.819 --> 44:52.455
A four-headed beast of
eating badassery, mini kiss!

44:52.457 --> 44:57.060
All right. Our last competitor
needs no introduction.

44:57.062 --> 44:59.429
All the way from Japan,

44:59.431 --> 45:01.864
he holds many,
many wins and records,

45:01.866 --> 45:03.366
including eight
Guinness records.

45:03.368 --> 45:05.268
The champion
of the world-famous

45:05.270 --> 45:08.371
Nathan's hot dog
eating contest at coney island,

45:08.373 --> 45:11.074
where his rookie appearance
doubled the previous record

45:11.076 --> 45:13.409
of 25 dogs in 12 minutes.

45:13.411 --> 45:16.179
He's even beaten a record
that was previously held

45:16.181 --> 45:21.150
by a fucking 1,000-pound Kodiak
bear at the Texas state fair.

45:21.152 --> 45:25.088
Standing at 5'8",
weighing 135 pounds,

45:25.090 --> 45:28.291
Takeru kobayashi!

45:33.031 --> 45:35.998
Yeah!

45:36.000 --> 45:39.736
Let him hear it!

45:39.738 --> 45:42.972
Start the clock!

45:42.974 --> 45:44.273
All right.

45:46.344 --> 45:49.378
Eating legend kobayashi.

45:49.380 --> 45:54.383
He grabbed the record for most
tacos here with 542 years ago.

45:54.385 --> 45:56.753
We're gonna break that tonight,
aren't we?

45:56.755 --> 45:58.855
Slow down!
Make some noise!

46:00.825 --> 46:03.526
Kobayashi is blowing
through the competition.

46:03.528 --> 46:05.828
I just stepped in brains.

46:05.830 --> 46:07.130
Fuck!

46:07.132 --> 46:09.098
Round of applause for kobayashi!

46:09.100 --> 46:13.970
Takeru kobayashi, the legend!

46:13.972 --> 46:16.906
Mini kiss is
tapping out, I think!

46:16.908 --> 46:21.144
Mini Catman is like,
"nuts to this."

46:21.146 --> 46:24.781
We're gonna go fight
the phantom of the...

46:24.783 --> 46:28.451
10, 9, 8, 7,

46:28.453 --> 46:33.422
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

46:38.162 --> 46:40.563
Kobayashi!

46:47.304 --> 46:49.472
97 eaten!

46:49.474 --> 46:53.242
He's gonna blow.
Everybody back up!

46:59.583 --> 47:01.450
It's like...

47:01.452 --> 47:04.887
It just sits...

47:21.372 --> 47:24.473
Now, what is the
most disgusting food

47:24.475 --> 47:27.410
that you've ever had to eat
during an eating competition?

47:27.412 --> 47:30.513
Oh, my god. Having to
eat brains, the brains.

47:30.515 --> 47:32.949
- What you ate tonight?
- Yes. That's right.

47:32.951 --> 47:34.584
Why was it so gross?

47:34.586 --> 47:40.323
Because they're stinky,
and they're mixed with alcohol,

47:40.325 --> 47:42.425
and it tastes so bad.

47:42.427 --> 47:46.362
So in the... in the whole world,
for all the competitions,

47:46.364 --> 47:49.298
tonight, in Minneapolis,
this was the most disgusting?

47:49.300 --> 47:52.201
Mm-hmm. Exactly.
Exactly.

47:52.203 --> 47:54.337
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

48:16.361 --> 48:19.095
Mike, let's go!

48:41.152 --> 48:43.552
I feel like you guys ruined
my game, first of all.

48:43.554 --> 48:45.288
Just gonna put that out there.

48:45.290 --> 48:47.390
I would like to see you
put out game one time, then.

48:47.392 --> 48:49.158
Can you drive?

48:49.160 --> 48:52.595
- Yeah, why?
- 'Cause you seem fucked up.

48:52.597 --> 48:54.130
Not...

48:56.167 --> 48:58.501
- Was that...
- You drive.

48:58.503 --> 49:02.438
- How are those fries?
- Cold as shit.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.607
Better than zombie brains,
that's for fucking sure.

49:04.609 --> 49:07.310
They said there's
30,000 people tonight.

49:07.312 --> 49:08.644
It was way nuttier.

49:08.646 --> 49:09.979
It was more fun
than bourbon street.

49:09.981 --> 49:11.447
Well, yeah, because everybody,

49:11.449 --> 49:13.182
they just love
getting fucked up,

49:13.184 --> 49:14.951
and they can walk
around like zombies.

49:14.953 --> 49:16.185
- Ah!
- Does it hurt?

49:16.187 --> 49:18.554
Zack:
Just do it one... one swoop.

49:18.556 --> 49:22.258
- Aah!

49:22.260 --> 49:24.660
No, no, no.
I'm not kidding. Don't to it.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.500
Jeff: Hopefully, I don't
hit these trees.

49:31.502 --> 49:33.502
Zack: I feel like we could
Gauge traffic this way.

49:33.504 --> 49:36.605
Like, you could send it up,
like, a mile and reroute us.

49:36.607 --> 49:38.307
Better than Google ma...
Jeff maps.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.508
Better than Jeff maps.

49:39.510 --> 49:41.344
It's following along.

49:41.346 --> 49:43.479
I told you,
1,500 feet is the high...

49:43.481 --> 49:44.747
I got it up there high
right now.

49:44.749 --> 49:46.749
It's about at 900.

49:46.751 --> 49:48.584
Bobby: Do you tell girls
you're a pilot?

49:48.586 --> 49:53.356
Just... keep it piling on.
I like all these titles.

49:53.358 --> 49:57.360
It's kind of like playing
a video game, Bobby.

49:57.362 --> 49:59.428
Bobby: Up, up, down, down,
left, right, left, right,

49:59.430 --> 50:01.097
select, a, b, a, b, start?

50:01.099 --> 50:03.532
No, you got it wrong.
A, b, a, b, select, start.

50:03.534 --> 50:05.101
Say it again?

50:05.103 --> 50:08.371
Up, up, down, down, left,
right, left, right,

50:08.373 --> 50:10.406
a, b, select, start, I think?

50:10.408 --> 50:12.241
- 99 lives.
- I don't know.

50:12.243 --> 50:13.643
Jeff:
You're going to need them all.

50:20.650 --> 50:23.285
See that, Brandy?
You're gonna get a little wet.

50:23.287 --> 50:24.520
Yoo-hoo!

50:24.522 --> 50:26.188
Bobby: So basically,
we came 900 miles

50:26.190 --> 50:28.124
to play capture the flag.

50:28.126 --> 50:30.760
Zack:
Yep, researching right now.

50:30.762 --> 50:33.496
It's, like, a picture,

50:33.498 --> 50:35.498
like, flag football,
and people run up.

50:35.500 --> 50:37.333
Zombies run up.
They grab your flag.

50:37.335 --> 50:38.667
If you can make it
through the whole 5k

50:38.669 --> 50:41.437
with both flags on,
then you win.

50:41.439 --> 50:43.072
Bobby: And it's all
in the daylight, bran,

50:43.074 --> 50:44.507
so nothing bad can happen.

50:44.509 --> 50:46.375
So people are running the 5k,

50:46.377 --> 50:48.577
and they're also sprinting
away from people.

50:48.579 --> 50:50.379
Makes it a little bit
harder for the people

50:50.381 --> 50:51.680
that are actually
gunning to win.

50:51.682 --> 50:53.449
You're gonna be
sprinting towards people

50:53.451 --> 50:55.351
because I signed you up
to be a zombie.

50:55.353 --> 50:59.155
So you will be chasing us
or anyone else.

50:59.157 --> 51:00.556
- Oh.
- So you preselect everything?

51:00.558 --> 51:02.258
Zach:
Yeah, no. You have the option,

51:02.260 --> 51:04.226
if you pay a little bit more,
you can be a zombie.

51:04.228 --> 51:06.228
So Mikey is going to
get to be a zombie.

51:06.230 --> 51:07.830
Do I get to dress up
as a zombie?

51:07.832 --> 51:09.632
Zack: They're gonna put makeup
on you, a costume.

51:09.634 --> 51:11.634
Yeah. I don't have to
run the whole time.

51:11.636 --> 51:13.669
I just have to be able...
Some wind sprint.

51:13.671 --> 51:16.105
Just sprint after people.
That's fantastic.

51:18.543 --> 51:20.576
Man: Hey, everyone's got to
be up at sunrise tomorrow.

51:20.578 --> 51:22.178
All right?

51:22.180 --> 51:24.680
Home sweet home for one night.

51:27.384 --> 51:28.851
Man: Where are the rest
of the idiots?

51:28.853 --> 51:30.386
I don't know. You're gonna
have to get Mike up

51:30.388 --> 51:31.687
because, I swear to god,
he's hit snooze

51:31.689 --> 51:33.255
for the past 45 minutes,

51:33.257 --> 51:35.257
and I cannot hear that sound
go off again.

51:35.259 --> 51:36.859
Man: Mike, let's go!

52:25.343 --> 52:30.579
Man: Music will play upon
the course of this event.

52:30.581 --> 52:32.915
When the music stops,

52:32.917 --> 52:38.687
you're either one of us
or one of them.

52:38.689 --> 52:41.857
28 days.

52:41.859 --> 52:44.193
28 weeks.

52:44.195 --> 52:50.666
The question is,
can you survive 28 minutes?

52:51.736 --> 52:56.839
Go!

55:06.737 --> 55:07.936
Jeff: So how was it?
Was it fun?

55:07.938 --> 55:09.405
It was good.
It was good.

55:09.407 --> 55:10.606
I mean, I'm soaked, but...

55:10.608 --> 55:12.641
Just good?
Well, you got to rate it.

55:12.643 --> 55:13.876
Yeah, fuck you.

55:13.878 --> 55:15.010
Hey, Brandy,
you've got to rate it.

55:15.012 --> 55:17.513
Was it four skulls, five skulls?

55:17.515 --> 55:19.315
Four skulls.
Four skulls.

55:19.317 --> 55:21.083
Jeff: Four skulls. That looked
badass with the drone.

55:21.085 --> 55:24.420
Water, subway, helicopters.

55:24.422 --> 55:26.355
What else you want?

55:26.357 --> 55:28.857
Way more fun than
a haunted house for you?

55:28.859 --> 55:30.726
And I got a workout in, so...

55:30.728 --> 55:32.528
I got to find Zack.

56:16.407 --> 56:18.440
Yo, Bob. Take a look.

56:21.612 --> 56:23.879
Guys, come here!
Look at this.

56:23.881 --> 56:26.749
"Seek out hellbent."

56:26.751 --> 56:28.384
Zack: Well, there it is again.

56:28.386 --> 56:30.953
We're going there
tomorrow night.

56:30.955 --> 56:32.955
"Seek out hellbent."

56:37.428 --> 56:39.595
Might get scared.

57:06.590 --> 57:08.457
Jeff, you had big titties
in your face.

57:08.459 --> 57:10.559
Now you're gonna
get laser titties.

57:10.561 --> 57:12.528
Jeff: Only because Brandy
changed her rule.

57:12.530 --> 57:15.864
Brandy: Ugh! I cannot believe you
guys got me to do this again.

57:15.866 --> 57:17.900
Man: It's an adult experience,
not a haunt.

57:17.902 --> 57:20.002
Two words... adults only.

57:20.004 --> 57:21.970
I don't know how that's different
than the other haunts we've been to,

57:21.972 --> 57:23.939
but none of them
have ever said it.

57:23.941 --> 57:25.607
Man: Stop saying laser titties.
That doesn't mean anything.

57:25.609 --> 57:27.009
It will.

57:30.848 --> 57:32.514
Drank gasoline.

57:32.516 --> 57:35.017
He's drinking gasoline.

57:35.019 --> 57:38.220
Brandy:
Whoo! Yeah!

57:38.222 --> 57:42.791
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, step right up.

57:46.697 --> 57:50.732
Halloween season is in the air,
and I don't know about you guys,

57:50.734 --> 57:52.634
but I would trade
all the other holidays

57:52.636 --> 57:53.836
for just one more of these.

57:53.838 --> 57:55.938
I'll be honest with you.
Right?

57:55.940 --> 57:59.241
You prove to me that
anything I do is fake,

57:59.243 --> 58:02.110
I will give you $10,000
on the spot.

58:02.112 --> 58:03.912
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

58:43.287 --> 58:47.789
Happy Halloween!

58:47.791 --> 58:50.058
Well, thank you guys
so much for coming out

58:50.060 --> 58:52.127
- to chambers of horror.
- Yeah, of course.

58:52.129 --> 58:53.729
Yeah, it's awesome
having you guys out.

58:53.731 --> 58:55.063
It's really cool.

58:55.065 --> 58:56.632
I've heard this is
an r-rated haunted house.

58:56.634 --> 58:58.700
It's definitely r-rated,

58:58.702 --> 59:02.738
lot of simulated nudity
and just weird stuff like that.

59:02.740 --> 59:04.540
It's, you know, thing is,

59:04.542 --> 59:05.974
you're not going to
scare everybody.

59:05.976 --> 59:08.143
We were kind of the idiots

59:08.145 --> 59:10.946
that came up with most
of this new stuff.

59:10.948 --> 59:12.981
It's like, how many times
can we spray people

59:12.983 --> 59:15.183
in the face
with water or fake jizz

59:15.185 --> 59:17.853
or whatever it is that happens?

59:17.855 --> 59:20.055
- Real jizz.
- It may or may not be.

59:20.057 --> 59:22.758
If you taste it,
it's kind of salty.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.259
I bet.

59:24.261 --> 59:26.795
You should never, ever,
ever lick something

59:26.797 --> 59:28.597
that lands on your face
in a haunted house.

59:28.599 --> 59:31.934
That's how herpes
and unwanted pregnancies start.

59:31.936 --> 59:33.669
- Not for the kiddies.
- I'd love that.

59:33.671 --> 59:35.103
- I thought it was great.
- That's right.

59:35.105 --> 59:37.773
Not for the kiddies
but for the three titties.

59:37.775 --> 59:39.174
- Look at that.
- Holy shit.

59:39.176 --> 59:40.776
Look at those titties.

59:45.916 --> 59:48.016
Man: Welcome.
If you seek an emergency,

59:48.018 --> 59:49.818
help will be given.

59:49.820 --> 59:51.687
We are here to help you.

59:51.689 --> 59:53.288
But under Obamacare,

59:53.290 --> 59:57.292
your vaccination against
the outbreak are not covered.

59:59.663 --> 01:00:01.730
This way, assholes.

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:04.066
"This way, assholes."

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:07.703
Clean, clean, surprisingly.

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:09.371
Oh, sorry, I forgot you, sir.

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:13.375
Saw that coming.

01:00:13.377 --> 01:00:15.043
Found the whore
of the group right here.

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:17.980
I bet you'd suck and fuck
any goddamn dick you seen,

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:19.181
wouldn't you?

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:21.683
The headache here
to the sore ass,

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:24.252
or is it just another fun
fudge-packing session, huh?

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:27.956
It's a redneck fiasco
of debauchery and insaneness.

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:31.393
That's what cool about doing it,
the extreme haunt.

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:34.630
You're just say,
"fuck the world." You know?

01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:37.165
Brandy: And with an extreme
haunt, is there any limitations

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.167
that people won't go to,
do you find?

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:41.403
Or do you think it's kind of
a free-for-all?

01:00:41.405 --> 01:00:44.139
Well, the market seems like
it's getting crazy stupid.

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:47.909
There's some people that call
snuff clubs haunted houses now.

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:50.145
And, uh, you know,
hackjob's thing,

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.314
it goes extreme as you
want it to nowadays.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:55.751
Man: You must be waiting
on the granny tranny gangbang!

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:59.154
Wait until you see
my next little fuck puppet!

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:00.856
Did you finger-blast
that hand again?

01:01:00.858 --> 01:01:02.357
Man: This fucking ass

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:06.161
and give you a double-donkey
mark you'll never forget.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:08.030
Little cotton swab up
your dick hole,

01:01:08.032 --> 01:01:09.431
make sure there
ain't shit all in there.

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:11.767
We gonna get you
cleaned up nice.

01:01:11.769 --> 01:01:13.235
After you've gotten
the vaccination,

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:16.071
don't worry because
then you got to get armed up

01:01:16.073 --> 01:01:17.739
and ready to do.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:19.941
Once everything is all set,
the doctor wait's short.

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:23.412
Come on.
Follow me this way!

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:26.682
Holy shit.
She just shot that dude.

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:28.417
We have to get the eggs
out of her anus,

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:31.119
so we're going to apply
a gentle laxative.

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:34.322
Might I ask for an assistant?

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:36.992
Come on! Push, cunt, push!

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:38.927
Oh, fuck it!

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:40.462
Oh, oh.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:42.397
If you want to die,
you should probably go that way

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.066
before we shove it in your anus.

01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:45.267
I heard he wanted...

01:01:45.269 --> 01:01:47.469
No.

01:01:47.471 --> 01:01:49.771
What the fuck is this?

01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:53.942
Damn it! You don't know
what they do to us in here.

01:01:55.979 --> 01:01:57.846
Ha, look at that!

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:59.748
- Looks like you two guys.
- Ah!

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:10.392
What the fuck?

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.294
Jeff:
Brandy, Brandy, let's go.

01:02:12.296 --> 01:02:14.096
Stay away from them.

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:33.081
Man: We've been waiting for you
all night.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.317
Laser titties.

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:45.360
Go, go, fucking go!
Get out of here, go, hard!

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:47.529
Get out of here now!

01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:54.803
Help me.
Please, you got to help me.

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:57.439
You come in here now, bitch.
You come with me.

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.441
Get your fucking ass up here.

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:03.178
Now, look, that's what she get
for using her titties now.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.380
We gonna have us an orgy here,

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:08.083
have us a good time, now,
ain't we?

01:03:08.085 --> 01:03:09.985
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry.

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:12.554
Come on. She jacked up
on that swamp juice!

01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:15.957
- Yeah. Oh!
- Oh, my god!

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:18.026
Please don't rape me.
Please don't rape me.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:21.296
Have us a good time.
Yeah.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.999
Come in. Come in.

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:26.434
I've been expecting you.
I need more children.

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:35.844
Come in, children.

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:38.213
Line your backs up
against the wall.

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:40.916
I've been expecting you,
yes, yes.

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:43.385
Man: Keep your eyes open,
your mouths closed.

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:53.094
Here we go!
Move! Move!

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:04.072
And I'm gonna pick up
one of these when we're done.

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:06.308
Man: How many of those shirts
do you have?

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:09.611
- Let's go.
- Nice.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.548
Break it down.

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:15.250
Step forward.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:21.122
You know you're beautiful,
mesmerizing.

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:25.360
Come.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:37.339
Brandy: Jeff, where did
everybody else go?

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:42.210
Jeff: How the hell do we
get out of here?

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:01.263
Yes.

01:05:01.265 --> 01:05:06.034
You only escaped 'cause
I let you, but not this time.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:38.333
Oh, fuck you guys.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:48.343
Look, I know you brought us
out here,

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:50.211
but this is fucking too far.

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:51.579
What?
Who are you talking about?

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:54.449
Brandy: Look, who is on this?
Who is this guy?

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.251
Jeff:
Dude, take a look.

01:05:56.253 --> 01:06:00.221
Man: That's just a mannequin.

01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:02.624
I don't know who that is.
That's not one of our actors.

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:04.192
- You don't know who that is?
- No, it's not.

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:05.527
How is it not
one of your actors?

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:08.663
He's here at your haunt.

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:11.733
That's not one of our masks.
I don't know what to tell you.

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:13.268
Brandy:
Look, okay, whatever.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.444
Good show.

01:06:22.446 --> 01:06:24.412
- Hey, is this mine? Or...
- Can I grab a couple...

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.481
- Shots of you?
- Okay.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.250
What happened?

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:32.053
Man: Oh, god, somebody
did something. I don't know.

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:34.689
- You want me to fight him?
- I'm a peon. I don't have a...

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:36.491
But, yeah,
something just happened.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:39.127
Man: Brandy, wait up.

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.996
You know what, guys?
I'm fucking done.

01:06:40.998 --> 01:06:42.230
What are you crying about?

01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:43.498
I know what you did in there.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.666
I went and I talked
to the manager,

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:46.301
so I know what you did.

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:47.502
So unless you want
to give me a fucking raise,

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.204
I'm not doing this shit anymore.

01:06:49.206 --> 01:06:51.039
We didn't do anything!
What are you talking about?

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.507
Whatever. That's what you say
every single time, and I'm done.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:55.010
- I'm done.
- Whatever.

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:56.378
I mean...

01:07:02.786 --> 01:07:06.254
Brandy, what the fuck?

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:08.523
- You guys are such jerks.
- So what's the deal?

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:11.493
You know what the deal is.
You guys set me up.

01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:13.561
- I don't know what you're...
- Set you up for what?

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:15.063
I don't know
what you guys are doing.

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:16.331
Like, you're just...

01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:18.066
I told you no shenanigans
or any of this...

01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:19.667
There's no shenanigans.
You don't know.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:21.336
Extreme haunt stuff.

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:23.671
Bobby: Jeff, what did you see?
You were with her.

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:25.273
We showed the manager
the footage.

01:07:25.275 --> 01:07:26.674
It was the same guy
from last year.

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:28.443
The guy didn't work
at the place.

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:30.378
It was just weird.
It was just weird.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.780
Like, the guy
didn't belong there.

01:07:31.782 --> 01:07:33.481
He looked just like
the guy from last year.

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:35.216
And he knows that some random...
Like, I don't understand.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.751
Jeff: Zack, I'm telling you,
like, it was really...

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:40.055
Bobby: I saw six skulls.
I saw six skulls in that haunt.

01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:42.824
It's the manager's job
to know all of his employees.

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:44.292
I think he knows.

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:47.595
And you recognize
a specific skull mask,

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:50.765
and he recognizes that that's
not one of his in the dark?

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:53.268
Hi. When something really big
happens in your life,

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.836
you tend to remember
it really well.

01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:56.304
Where the fuck did you guys go?
I have everything up.

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:57.806
Zack:
Brandy and Jeff are freaking out

01:07:57.808 --> 01:07:59.741
because a guy in a skull mask
jumped out at them.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:01.443
Mikey: What happened?

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:02.744
We were going through the haunt,
and there was a guy...

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.479
And you got scared.

01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:06.448
That's what the point of going
to a haunted house is.

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:08.216
Okay. I feel like
you're just...

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:11.186
You're demeaning this a little
bit, and it's not fair.

01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:14.722
It's... we asked the manager,
and he said it wasn't his guy.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.457
I think he knows
who works there.

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.760
And this is not
worth it for me anymore.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.528
This is...
It's just not worth it.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.464
Brandy, they're paying us
a lot of money.

01:08:22.466 --> 01:08:23.832
We still have hellbent.

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:25.200
We have to go
to the haunted hoochie,

01:08:25.202 --> 01:08:26.835
and we have Satan's hollow.

01:08:26.837 --> 01:08:29.270
Great. This is not worth it
for me anymore.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:30.705
It's just not.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:32.439
What do you need?

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.845
I'll give you more money.
We have to finish.

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:40.115
We have those three places,
and that's it.

01:08:40.117 --> 01:08:41.716
Hellbent's tomorrow night.

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:43.785
We have... and then, Friday,
we'll go to the haunted hoochie.

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.386
We'll end the weekend
with Satan's hollow.

01:08:45.388 --> 01:08:47.421
We're done.

01:08:47.424 --> 01:08:49.524
Okay. I'll do one more,
but I'm...

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:51.426
I'm not making guarantees
about the others.

01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:54.662
Okay. I will transfer you
more money in the morning.

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.296
Bobby: Haunt extortion.

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:58.198
Do you want me to go or not?

01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:01.402
Because I think you kind of need
to stop right about now.

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:03.705
All good?

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:05.840
But also, don't freak out.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.209
It's... you're supposed
to be getting scared.

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:09.544
It's a haunted house.

01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:10.845
Okay. Whatever, Zack.

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:14.749
You obviously just
don't understand.

01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:17.285
- Why are you paying her more?
- Well...

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:19.587
- I was scared, too.
- Shut up, Mike.

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:21.421
Bobby: Nobody's paying
for the bearded man.

01:09:21.424 --> 01:09:23.591
They're paying for coffin girl.

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:37.337
This is what got Brandy to stay.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.607
Hey, don't eat my healthy
snacks, all right, bro?

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:41.209
- Fucking water.
- What?

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:43.845
- At least we got her to stay.
- Yeah, true.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.616
- All right.
- All right.

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:49.951
I'm gonna go to bed.

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:52.420
Long day tomorrow.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:54.923
- Going to go hit the hay, bro?
- Toast.

01:09:54.925 --> 01:09:57.325
Go hit the hay, farm boy.

01:09:57.327 --> 01:10:00.762
Without sleep,
you live two lives, Jeff boy.

01:10:00.764 --> 01:10:02.597
Shut it down, bro.

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:06.921
Zack: Jeff, I said get up now.
Let's go.

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:08.623
- What?
- Mike, Brandy, get up.

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:09.891
- What?
- It's 4 fucking o'clock.

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:11.359
We're never gonna make it
to the haunt.

01:12:11.361 --> 01:12:13.094
Go now, right now.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:15.897
Jeff, let's get going.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:20.068
- What the fuck?
- Hey, dude.

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:22.704
- Fuck, dude.
- How is it 4:00?

01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:24.439
- Hey, we got to get on the road.
- Morning.

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:26.474
We got to get on the road.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:28.876
What the fuck are you
talking about it's 4:00?

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:30.011
How does...

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:33.948
Jesus Christ.
I feel like shit.

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:38.753
Where the fuck... this is not
the fucking campground.

01:12:38.755 --> 01:12:41.522
What the fuck?

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.727
Bobby:
Where the hell are we?

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:54.469
Where did you park last night?

01:12:54.471 --> 01:12:56.504
Jeff:
I parked at a campground.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:58.106
- This... this is...
- You saw other RVs?

01:12:58.108 --> 01:13:00.742
Jeff: This is absolutely not
the place we were at last night.

01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:02.643
I don't know where we're at.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:04.612
Bobby:
Zack, look at the sign.

01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:09.684
- Hellbent.
- God damn it.

01:13:09.686 --> 01:13:11.119
What the fuck?

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:14.122
Brandy:
Guys, what's going on?

01:13:14.124 --> 01:13:15.456
- Somebody's literally...
- What the fuck?

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:16.791
Open the door, Bobby.

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:18.393
There's a sconce
that's sitting in the door.

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:19.794
- Open the door.
- The door is fucking locked.

01:13:19.796 --> 01:13:21.896
Mikey: That guy's wearing
my fucking suit, man.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:25.566
Brandy: What?

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:32.540
Mikey: Jesus Christ.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:33.975
Brandy: Guys, this is the stuff
I'm talking about.

01:13:33.977 --> 01:13:36.511
I did not sign up for this.

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:41.416
Bobby: Check your closet now.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.920
- Yeah, that's mine.
- Is it in there?

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.088
- No, it's gone.
- They've been in here?

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.756
I don't have it!

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:54.495
Go ahead.
Look where we are, bro.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.101
- How are we in north Carolina?
- I have no fucking idea.

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:01.769
How are we in fucking
north Carolina?

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.905
I have no idea how we're
in north Carolina right now.

01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:05.440
- We went to bed.
- How is it 4:00 P.M.?

01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:06.808
Zack:
The clown just left.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:08.476
Brandy: Are they just gonna
leave us in here?

01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:10.144
Well, he's not gonna let us
out until it's dark.

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:12.079
It's gonna be
fucking locked till dark.

01:14:12.081 --> 01:14:13.648
We're not gonna be
able to get out.

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:15.550
And then they're gonna
have us go in.

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:18.453
You got us in some deep
fucking shit tonight.

01:14:28.932 --> 01:14:31.766
It's time.

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:34.569
Brandy:
Guys, this is insane.

01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:37.071
Zack:
Welcome to hellbent.

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.779
- You ready, Brandy?
- Lights on.

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:48.015
Here we go.

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:39.126
Please, please let me go.

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:42.630
I don't want anything
to do with this.

01:21:42.632 --> 01:21:45.666
I'll go wherever you want.
Just take your hands off me.

01:21:58.014 --> 01:22:00.614
Brandy: Stop. Stop!

01:22:00.616 --> 01:22:02.416
Why are you doing this?

01:22:26.575 --> 01:22:28.676
Stop!

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.388
What's going on?
Get off me.

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:45.025
I don't... just tell me
what's going on.

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:55.002
Bobby! What's going...

01:22:55.004 --> 01:22:56.303
- Bobby!

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:58.405
Stop! Stop!

01:22:58.407 --> 01:23:01.542
Please stop!
Please just stop!

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:02.676
No!

01:23:05.081 --> 01:23:07.114
Bobby!

01:23:07.116 --> 01:23:09.683
Stop! No!

01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:12.286
No! No!

01:23:12.288 --> 01:23:15.756
No!

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:25.199
Brandy: Are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:27.134
No! No, Bobby!

01:23:27.136 --> 01:23:29.436
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

01:23:29.438 --> 01:23:31.138
No!

01:23:39.548 --> 01:23:41.682
What do you guys want?

01:23:56.032 --> 01:23:57.331
No!

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:08.402
Jeff! Jeff!

01:25:10.106 --> 01:25:11.605
Please help.

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:14.108
Please help. No.

01:25:29.391 --> 01:25:30.891
Aah!

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:38.165
Aah!

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:55.809
Ah.

01:28:40.949 --> 01:28:43.483
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, oh, oh, Brandy!

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.720
- Put the gun down.
- Brandy, it's us.

01:28:46.722 --> 01:28:48.588
You fucking knew the whole time!

01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:50.090
- What is this?
- What the fuck's going on?

01:28:50.092 --> 01:28:51.725
It's not fucking funny!

01:28:51.727 --> 01:28:53.994
Brandy, it's us!
Brandy, it's us!

01:28:53.996 --> 01:28:55.762
It's us! It's us! It's us!

01:28:55.764 --> 01:28:57.431
Put the gun down!

01:28:57.433 --> 01:28:58.965
- What the fuck is this?
- Put the gun down.

01:28:58.967 --> 01:29:00.701
- What is this?
- Hey!

01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:03.670
No. It's not fucking funny!
It's never been funny!

01:29:05.107 --> 01:29:08.408
Put the gun down!

01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:10.610
- You guys just fuck with me!
- There was a check!

01:29:10.612 --> 01:29:12.012
No. There was a check,
and there's money in there!

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:13.814
Yeah, I don't give a fuck
anymore!

01:29:13.816 --> 01:29:15.382
- Is this what you want?
- Brandy, it's all fake.

01:29:15.384 --> 01:29:16.717
Seriously,
put the gun down, please.

01:29:16.719 --> 01:29:18.051
What are you doing?
Where did you get a gun?

01:29:18.053 --> 01:29:19.486
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

01:29:19.488 --> 01:29:20.954
Brandy, stop! Brandy!

01:29:20.956 --> 01:29:23.390
No! Jesus Christ,
somebody call an ambulance!

01:29:23.392 --> 01:29:24.524
- What the fuck?
- Brandy?

01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:26.393
What the fuck did you do?

01:29:26.395 --> 01:29:28.695
- What the fuck did you do?
- Brandy, Brandy!

01:29:46.982 --> 01:29:50.550
<i>- Oh, man, check this out.
- What you got there?</i>

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:52.486
<i>Same watch we got
that camera from.</i>

01:29:52.488 --> 01:29:53.954
<i>Cool. Let's go make
a movie out of it.</i>

01:29:53.956 --> 01:29:55.756
<i>Let's make a movie.</i>

01:29:59.862 --> 01:30:01.595
<i>Hey, guys, this is
the ladies' restroom.</i>

01:30:01.597 --> 01:30:05.532
<i>Yeah. We know.
We're shooting a little video.</i>

01:30:05.534 --> 01:30:07.534
Brandy: <i>That's not what
we're here to do.</i>

01:30:16.178 --> 01:30:19.613
<i>Why is there an alarm?
What the hell happened?</i>

01:30:19.615 --> 01:30:22.115
<i>Hey, what is...</i>

01:30:22.117 --> 01:30:24.084
<i>- What the hell's going on?
- Why are the cops here, dude?</i>

01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:26.019
<i>What do you mean,
the fucking cops are here?</i>

01:30:26.021 --> 01:30:28.088
<i>Do you hear him on the walkie?
He said the cops are here.</i>

01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:31.124
<i>Hold it. We did everything
they fucking said,</i>

01:30:31.126 --> 01:30:32.726
<i>everything they fucking said.</i>

01:30:32.728 --> 01:30:34.494
<i>- I know!
- Where's Brandy?</i>

01:30:34.496 --> 01:30:35.829
<i>Why are the cops here?</i>

01:30:35.831 --> 01:30:37.931
<i>I'm getting the fuck
out of here.</i>

01:31:18.574 --> 01:31:20.106
Bobby:
<i>This is the layout of hellbent.</i>

01:31:20.108 --> 01:31:21.741
<i>Mikey's in the first room.</i>

01:31:21.743 --> 01:31:23.577
<i>That's the fireplace room.</i>

01:31:23.579 --> 01:31:24.945
<i>She goes to the next room,</i>

01:31:24.947 --> 01:31:26.713
<i>and that's when
we get blood boarded,</i>

01:31:26.715 --> 01:31:28.548
<i>and we go to next one,
and that's Zack.</i>

01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:30.183
<i>That's the chainsaw room.</i>

01:31:30.185 --> 01:31:32.052
<i>Then, after that, she's gonna
get pushed to you, Jeff,</i>

01:31:32.054 --> 01:31:33.753
<i>and you hanging
from the ceiling.</i>

01:31:33.755 --> 01:31:35.155
<i>Then we go out
through the back tunnels.</i>

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:36.857
<i>We all change.</i>

01:31:36.859 --> 01:31:38.825
<i>She's gonna get brought
right up through here</i>

01:31:38.827 --> 01:31:40.193
<i>in the mousetrap.</i>

01:31:40.195 --> 01:31:42.596
<i>We surround her,
start bringing her in.</i>

01:31:42.598 --> 01:31:44.130
<i>She should be
contained right here.</i>

01:31:44.132 --> 01:31:45.899
<i>That way, they get the shot
they asked for,</i>

01:31:45.901 --> 01:31:47.000
<i>and we get paid.</i>

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:48.568
<i>Give her the casket.</i>

01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:49.736
<i>She opens it up,
check's in the casket,</i>

01:31:49.738 --> 01:31:51.905
<i>happy Halloween, done.</i>

01:31:51.907 --> 01:31:54.708
<i>Hopefully, she doesn't
want to fucking kill us.</i>

01:33:21.597 --> 01:33:23.196
- Brandy!
- Brandy, come on!

01:33:23.198 --> 01:33:25.231
Brandy, Brandy, Brandy, Brandy!

01:33:25.233 --> 01:33:26.967

01:33:26.969 --> 01:33:28.969
Brandy!

01:33:28.971 --> 01:33:30.637
Jesus Christ.
Somebody call an ambulance!

01:33:30.639 --> 01:33:31.638
- Brandy?
- Brandy?

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.139
What the fuck did you do?

01:33:33.141 --> 01:33:35.008
What the fuck did you do?

01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:36.810
Brandy? Brandy?
Come on!

01:33:36.812 --> 01:33:38.712
Brandy, Brandy,
Brandy, Brandy, Brandy?

01:33:38.714 --> 01:33:41.114
Holy shit.

01:33:41.116 --> 01:33:42.816
What the fuck are you doing?
Is this a joke?

01:33:42.818 --> 01:33:44.751
- Oh, my god. Are you kidding me?
- It's a fucking joke?

01:33:44.753 --> 01:33:48.288
What? You wanted your grand
finale, your big ending?

01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:49.956
You've got your
fucking big ending,

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:53.960
and you've got your
fucking dumb shirt.

01:33:53.962 --> 01:33:55.729
- You know about this?
- I'm done with you guys.

01:33:55.731 --> 01:33:57.130
- Did you know about this, Bobby?
- Done!

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:59.199
What did I know
about the what...

01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:00.967
Oh, my god.

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:03.870
This was supposed to
be about you.

01:34:03.872 --> 01:34:05.305
We did it for you.
There was money.

01:34:05.307 --> 01:34:07.073
There was a check in there.
It was supposed...

01:34:07.075 --> 01:34:08.908
It was... it's not a joke.
It was for you.

01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:12.812
Bobby: The fuck is this?
Did you set this up?

01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:15.115
- They told us we film.
- Such bullshit.

01:34:15.117 --> 01:34:16.883
Bobby:
We put you in the situation.

01:34:16.885 --> 01:34:18.685
We ham it up for the cameras.

01:34:18.687 --> 01:34:19.986
Their shit goes viral.

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:22.422
We get paid fuck-tons of money.

01:34:22.424 --> 01:34:24.924
That was it.
That was all.

01:34:24.926 --> 01:34:27.060
- We did not mean to hurt you.
- This was money.

01:34:27.062 --> 01:34:29.095
Bobby: There was supposed to be
a fucking check in there...

01:34:29.097 --> 01:34:31.431
- Yeah.
- Not a gun!

01:34:31.433 --> 01:34:34.167
- I'm done.
- Brandy, we're so sorry.

01:34:34.169 --> 01:34:36.436
Mikey: Brandy.

01:34:36.438 --> 01:34:38.338
What?
Go away.

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.106
Mike, go away.
