Would you like
to rephrase that?

34:53.929 --> 34:56.178
Let me think about it.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.887
Fuck off, cunt.

35:12.303 --> 35:15.970
Now, you, sir, must recall
one salient factor.

35:18.887 --> 35:21.428
You're an odious tub of guts

35:21.512 --> 35:24.470
of which I'm making use.

35:24.553 --> 35:28.303
You have a singular gift
