00:00.330 --> 00:03.000
Previously on Elementary:
I am happy for you--

00:03.000 --> 00:04.630
your decision
to become a parent.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.420
So, how are you gonna feel
about having a kid around?

00:06.420 --> 00:09.460
I mean, I would not expect
you to co-parent or anything.

00:09.460 --> 00:11.710
The baby would be
my responsibility.

00:11.710 --> 00:12.790
For you, Watson,

00:12.790 --> 00:13.790
I'd make adjustments.

00:13.790 --> 00:16.300
When she told me of her plan
the other day,

00:16.300 --> 00:17.790
I was very surprised.

00:17.790 --> 00:19.460
But when you know her
as well as I do,

00:19.460 --> 00:21.460
it makes sense
her being a parent.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.710
The child
that she raises

00:22.710 --> 00:25.170
will be very, very lucky.

00:43.790 --> 00:45.300
(footsteps approaching)

00:45.300 --> 00:46.920
Sorry. I was, uh...

00:46.920 --> 00:48.710
I was taking some measurements.

00:48.710 --> 00:49.630
I'm reexamining

00:49.630 --> 00:51.670
a suspicious
hunting accident

00:51.670 --> 00:55.340
in Georgia's
Oaky Woods in 1933.

00:55.340 --> 00:56.380
Yeah, I figured.

00:56.380 --> 00:58.300
But the murder took
place in the woods,

00:58.300 --> 00:59.630
so what's with
the dollhouse?

00:59.630 --> 01:02.500
I mean, you only use this
to restage crime scenes.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.960
Well, I did,
but you'll notice

01:03.960 --> 01:05.790
it is a house
of horrors no more.

01:05.790 --> 01:07.340
I removed all
of the dead dolls

01:07.340 --> 01:10.130
and cleaned up all
of the blood and viscera.

01:10.130 --> 01:11.050
Okay.

01:11.050 --> 01:12.750
Thought it might make
a good impression

01:12.750 --> 01:15.790
to have it on display
during your home visit tomorrow.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.750
As opposed to
the bear trap,

01:17.750 --> 01:20.790
which I will store
posthaste.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.790
Thank you-- on both parts.

01:23.790 --> 01:25.960
But the caseworker is just
coming here to discuss plans

01:25.960 --> 01:27.840
to, you know, make the house
more baby-friendly.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.670
So there's really no need
to put out toys.

01:30.670 --> 01:31.790
Still, no harm, is there?

01:31.790 --> 01:34.170
We'll have to do something
about those.

01:34.170 --> 01:35.090
What, the locks?

01:35.090 --> 01:36.790
No, the grids
they're hanging on.

01:36.790 --> 01:41.300
A curious infant could pull them
down upon himself, no?

01:41.300 --> 01:42.170
Yeah, I guess.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.790
You know, I think we're
mainly gonna talk

01:43.790 --> 01:45.090
about child-proof locks
for the cabinets

01:45.090 --> 01:46.800
and drawers-- you know,
things like that.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.250
Well, it's funny
you should mention that,

01:48.250 --> 01:49.800
because I've been reviewing
those products,

01:49.800 --> 01:50.880
and I find them all lacking.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.710
I think any child raised
in this home

01:52.710 --> 01:54.790
would be able to
circumvent such measures

01:54.790 --> 01:56.500
in no time-- don't you?

01:56.500 --> 01:59.340
(cell phone rings)
Hey, Marcus.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.500
We'll be right there.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.880
BELL:
Victim's name is Leland Frisk,

02:03.880 --> 02:05.790
head of Frisk Relocations, Inc.
(sniffing)

02:05.790 --> 02:08.300
Say your company's opening
a new office in another state

02:08.300 --> 02:10.840
or transferring an employee
from one city to another.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.670
Guy like this
arranges housing,

02:13.670 --> 02:16.050
family cars, new
schools for the kids.

02:16.050 --> 02:17.460
Cleaning crew found him.

02:17.460 --> 02:21.210
MLI puts the time of death
between 8:00 and 10:00.

02:21.210 --> 02:22.790
Sciacchetrà.

02:24.710 --> 02:25.790
Like "Chaka Khan."

02:25.790 --> 02:27.210
Is that also a wine?

02:28.250 --> 02:28.790
No.

02:28.790 --> 02:31.590
Sciacchetrà is a dessert wine,
produced exclusively

02:31.590 --> 02:33.340
in Italy's
Cinque Terre.

02:33.340 --> 02:35.090
It's not terribly common
in the States,

02:35.090 --> 02:36.340
but it's not
impossible to find.

02:36.340 --> 02:40.090
Its aromatic notes should
include honey, dried fruit.

02:40.090 --> 02:43.380
What it should not smell like
is almonds.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.050
Someone laced it with cyanide.

02:45.050 --> 02:46.300
Presumably not the victim,

02:46.300 --> 02:48.170
or else you wouldn't
have asked us here.

02:48.170 --> 02:50.000
Along with the vomit
around the victim's mouth,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.500
one of the glasses
back there was wet.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.630
It was the only one that matched
the glass Frisk drank from,

02:55.630 --> 02:57.790
so CSU dusted
it for prints.

02:57.790 --> 02:58.630
Thanks.

02:58.630 --> 03:00.920
Uh, looks like someone
tried to wipe it clean,

03:00.920 --> 03:02.790
but we managed to
lift two partials.

03:02.790 --> 03:04.790
So we're gonna run 'em,
see what we get.

03:04.790 --> 03:06.250
So Frisk probably knew
the killer.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.210
He or she brought
their own glasses.

03:08.210 --> 03:10.380
After Frisk was dead,
they emptied theirs,

03:10.380 --> 03:11.550
put it back on the bar.

03:11.550 --> 03:14.590
Cyanide poisoning
is a painful way to go.

03:14.590 --> 03:15.920
Every muscle in the
body seizes up,

03:15.920 --> 03:18.790
and the victim dies
of cardiac arrest.

03:18.790 --> 03:19.880
Do you have any idea why someone

03:19.880 --> 03:21.790
would want
a relocation expert dead?

03:21.790 --> 03:22.960
There's more to show you
out here.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.380
And it might change the way
you think about Mr. Frisk.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.800
The doorjamb's busted.

03:32.340 --> 03:35.130
So someone broke in here
after Frisk was dead,

03:35.130 --> 03:36.300
looking for something.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.170
Check out what's
in these files.

03:38.170 --> 03:40.960
'Cause they are not
what you'd expect

03:40.960 --> 03:43.790
from a
relocation expert.

03:44.670 --> 03:45.790
Well, I'm guessing

03:45.790 --> 03:47.250
that's not this guy's wife.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.960
And this man is not
a licensed pharmacist.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.800
If you ask me,
it looks like Leland Frisk

03:52.800 --> 03:53.880
was a serial blackmailer.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.050
Could be one of his clients
had enough,

03:56.050 --> 03:57.920
decided to get out
from under his thumb,

03:57.920 --> 04:00.130
they poisoned him,
then busted in here,

04:00.130 --> 04:01.960
took what he had on them.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.130
I disagree.

04:03.130 --> 04:05.460
A lot of the names
on these files

04:05.460 --> 04:06.380
are familiar to me

04:06.380 --> 04:08.000
from news stories
over the years.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.420
Each one of them was,
at one time or another,

04:10.420 --> 04:12.090
suspected of having
a business rival

04:12.090 --> 04:15.550
or another inconvenience
assassinated.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.790
None was ever charged.

04:26.790 --> 04:31.300
I don't think Frisk
was a blackmailer.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.130
At least not primarily.

04:32.130 --> 04:36.840
I think those files
are insurance policies.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.790
To dissuade his clients
from betraying him.

04:57.670 --> 05:00.550
Most of those have something
to do with relocation work,

05:00.550 --> 05:02.960
but a lot of them contain
blackmail information

05:02.960 --> 05:04.790
dating back
to the '80s.

05:04.790 --> 05:05.790
Which means...

05:05.790 --> 05:06.840
The dead man in that room

05:06.840 --> 05:11.790
is one of the most prolific
contract killers in history.

05:13.710 --> 05:16.250
♪ ♪

05:48.170 --> 05:51.210
This is Byron Pruitt,
CEO of Lake Huron Canning.

05:51.210 --> 05:53.790
He was questioned in 2004
about the disappearance

05:53.790 --> 05:55.750
of his mistress, Noreen Cullen.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.750
This is Rueben Del Mar
the Fourth,

05:57.750 --> 06:00.960
heir to Utah's Del Mar
Auto Service empire.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.920
He was long suspected
of ordering the murder

06:02.920 --> 06:05.340
of his father,
Rueben Del Mar the Third.

06:05.340 --> 06:06.790
And the list goes on.

06:06.790 --> 06:08.340
GREGSON:
And you think Frisk

06:08.340 --> 06:09.670
pulled off all
these hits

06:09.670 --> 06:11.790
under the cover of a
relocation business?

06:11.790 --> 06:13.830
Most of his work
was for corporate bigwigs,

06:13.930 --> 06:14.970
so it was the perfect front.

06:14.970 --> 06:16.640
He got paid
on the company's books

06:16.640 --> 06:17.510
as a short-term contractor,

06:17.510 --> 06:20.010
and he had reason
to travel wherever he needed.

06:20.010 --> 06:23.300
So, Marcus has been reaching out
to law enforcement

06:23.300 --> 06:25.100
in these cities
all morning.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.090
Now, these files
may not be enough

06:27.090 --> 06:28.090
to convict
in every case,

06:28.090 --> 06:30.510
but now that police can connect
these people with Frisk,

06:30.510 --> 06:31.850
and we know
how he got paid,

06:31.850 --> 06:35.140
it could help close
a lot of cases.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.760
That's the Incubus.

06:37.760 --> 06:38.890
It's a
suffocation device.

06:38.890 --> 06:40.050
You place it
over the victim's

06:40.050 --> 06:41.890
nose and mouth,
pull out the plunger.

06:41.890 --> 06:42.970
Forms a vacuum seal,

06:42.970 --> 06:45.090
suck all the air out
of their lungs.

06:45.090 --> 06:46.390
It's quick, and it's quiet.

06:46.390 --> 06:49.300
And it leaves no evidence
of a murder weapon.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.100
Well, at most,

06:50.100 --> 06:52.050
a subtle ring of, uh,
broken blood vessels

06:52.050 --> 06:54.930
around the mouth, but, um,
if the bruises are detected,

06:54.930 --> 06:58.300
most M.E.'s don't know
what to make of them.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.550
Okay.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.090
So, who do we think
hit the hit man?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.890
Well, Frisk's files
were numbered,

07:04.890 --> 07:06.470
so we know that one of them
was missing.

07:06.470 --> 07:08.090
We figure the killer
took his or her own

07:08.090 --> 07:09.850
so that it couldn't be used
against them.

07:09.850 --> 07:11.640
We got the name
of Frisk's assistant

07:11.640 --> 07:12.640
from his building manager.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.260
Marcus and I are going
to pay her a visit.

07:14.260 --> 07:17.300
Hopefully she'll be able to
identify which file is missing.

07:17.300 --> 07:18.550
And you?
One of the people

07:18.550 --> 07:20.050
that Marcus spoke to
was an FBI agent

07:20.050 --> 07:21.720
who works out
of the New York field office.

07:21.720 --> 07:24.140
She's been working two of the
murders. She's on her way here.

07:24.140 --> 07:27.640
I figured I'd stick around
and talk to her with you.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.300
AGENT:
This is amazing.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.050
I was only ever
onto two of these,

07:32.050 --> 07:34.550
and I wasn't even sure
it was the same guy.

07:34.550 --> 07:36.890
How did you connect
the two you were onto?

07:36.890 --> 07:37.680
This guy here,

07:37.680 --> 07:40.050
Pat Mercer-- he ran
a dirty hedge fund.

07:40.050 --> 07:41.550
About a year ago,
one of his analysts

07:41.550 --> 07:43.140
turned whistleblower,
and right after she did,

07:43.140 --> 07:45.640
she was shot dead
on the street near her home.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.510
Looked like a robbery,
but she was cooperating

07:48.510 --> 07:50.890
in a federal case,
so it landed on my desk.

07:50.890 --> 07:52.100
Witness reported
seeing a tall,

07:52.100 --> 07:53.430
Caucasian male
with a goatee

07:53.430 --> 07:55.720
hurrying away about half a block
from the scene.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.970
That describes Leland Frisk.

07:57.970 --> 07:59.890
Obviously not a lot to go on.

07:59.890 --> 08:01.720
Till about three months ago.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.600
Gordon Harper...

08:02.600 --> 08:06.140
was forcing a hostile buyout
of a small chemical company

08:06.140 --> 08:07.260
when its president supposedly

08:07.260 --> 08:08.890
took a leap
out a 40th-floor window.

08:08.890 --> 08:11.180
Detective in the 16th
gave me a heads-up.

08:11.180 --> 08:12.090
People there recall

08:12.090 --> 08:14.350
an unfamiliar janitor there
that day.

08:14.350 --> 08:17.600
A tall, Caucasian male
with a goatee.

08:18.260 --> 08:21.090
So Frisk manages to stay a ghost
for over 30 years,

08:21.090 --> 08:22.300
then he's spotted twice

08:22.300 --> 08:23.300
in nine months.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.390
Just an old hit man

08:24.390 --> 08:25.300
finally slowing down?

08:25.300 --> 08:26.220
AGENT:
Good a guess as any.

08:26.220 --> 08:28.180
Whatever it was, I have
something to run with now.

08:28.180 --> 08:31.600
Enough to put the screws
to both Mercer and Harper.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.600
Funny thing is,

08:32.600 --> 08:34.510
I was just starting
to look at the books

08:34.510 --> 08:36.220
of both companies
for any commonalities.

08:36.220 --> 08:38.090
You gotta think
I would've come across

08:38.090 --> 08:39.760
this relocation service
eventually.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.350
WATSON: Maybe that
explains the timing

08:41.350 --> 08:42.679
of Frisk's murder.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.220
One of his clients
became aware

08:44.220 --> 08:46.600
of the investigation,
and knew that Frisk

08:46.600 --> 08:49.970
could use his blackmail files
to take them down with him.

08:49.970 --> 08:51.010
We're gonna need the names

08:51.010 --> 08:53.180
of anyone who knew
what you were onto.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.300
Anyone in your office,

08:54.300 --> 08:56.470
anyone you interviewed
at those companies.

08:56.470 --> 09:00.090
You're thinking my investigation
tipped Frisk's killer?

09:01.090 --> 09:02.100
If it did, I'll sleep fine.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.090
That guy had decades of blood
on his hands.

09:04.090 --> 09:06.300
Trust me, no one's shedding
a tear for Leland Frisk.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.850
But whoever killed him
has hired a hit man

09:09.850 --> 09:11.760
at least once,
and murdered him.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.140
I'd say he's one more person
we need to get off the streets.

09:15.140 --> 09:16.510
Wouldn't you?

09:16.510 --> 09:19.760
I'll get you a list.

09:20.390 --> 09:22.010
Sherry Lennox?

09:22.010 --> 09:23.090
Marcus Bell, NYPD.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.680
This is my colleague,
Mr. Holmes.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.970
You work for Leland Frisk,
is that right?

09:26.970 --> 09:30.010
I was just about
to leave for work.

09:30.010 --> 09:32.140
Did something happen?

09:34.090 --> 09:35.100
None of this makes any sense.

09:35.100 --> 09:38.300
Leland helped situate people
who were moving to new cities.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.390
He wasn't an assassin.

09:39.390 --> 09:42.430
Respectfully, Miss Lennox,
we're pretty sure he was.

09:42.430 --> 09:44.090
You're telling us
you had no idea?

09:44.090 --> 09:45.550
If I had, do you
really think

09:45.550 --> 09:47.090
that I would have kept
working for him?

09:47.090 --> 09:49.850
HOLMES: Can you tell us
your whereabouts last night

09:49.850 --> 09:52.010
between 8:00 and 10:00?

09:52.100 --> 09:54.970
My son and I were at my
sister's in Marlboro.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.090
I'll give you her info.

09:56.090 --> 09:58.050
I promise,
you're not gonna find anything

09:58.050 --> 09:59.470
about murders for money
on there.

09:59.470 --> 10:02.350
BELL: We just want to see your
copies of Mr. Frisk's files.

10:02.350 --> 10:04.180
We think the killer
took one from the scene.

10:04.180 --> 10:06.720
So, if we can spot a client name
that's in your data

10:06.720 --> 10:09.090
that wasn't at the office,
there's a good chance

10:09.090 --> 10:10.090
that client's our killer.

10:10.090 --> 10:13.430
How long have you
worked for Mr. Frisk?

10:13.430 --> 10:15.760
Oh, God, um...

10:15.760 --> 10:17.090
over 15 years.

10:17.090 --> 10:19.850
Did you interact much
with his clients?

10:19.850 --> 10:21.010
It varied.

10:21.010 --> 10:24.350
I mostly arranged his travel,
paid the bills.

10:24.350 --> 10:25.800
I spoke to some of the clients

10:25.800 --> 10:28.390
on the phone, but
others, he gave them

10:28.390 --> 10:29.300
his direct number.

10:29.300 --> 10:32.180
I just assumed that they were,
you know, VIPs.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.970
People he wanted to give
more personal attention.

10:34.970 --> 10:36.220
You might be right about that.

10:36.220 --> 10:40.260
I'm guessing one of the
clients' names was Cal Medina?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.260
He's been in the news
a few times.

10:42.260 --> 10:45.760
Owns a drug company that's
gotten heat for its practices.

10:45.760 --> 10:46.970
I'm familiar with the name,

10:46.970 --> 10:48.140
but he doesn't develop
new drugs.

10:48.140 --> 10:51.090
He simply buys the rights
to existing, much needed ones

10:51.090 --> 10:52.180
and jacks up their prices.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.090
Medina's name
is in your client list,

10:54.090 --> 10:56.430
but it wasn't in the info
at the office.

10:56.430 --> 10:57.350
I'd have noticed it.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.640
Uh, Leland did
some work for him

10:59.640 --> 11:02.100
back in 2014, I think.

11:02.100 --> 11:05.430
He was one of the clients that
Leland handled personally.

11:05.430 --> 11:09.550
Do you think he
killed Leland?

11:10.390 --> 11:12.090
Hi, Marybeth.
It's Joan Watson.

11:12.090 --> 11:14.220
Yes, I was just wondering
if we were still

11:14.220 --> 11:15.350
doing the home visit today.

11:15.350 --> 11:19.300
You were supposed to be here
about 30 minutes ago.

11:19.850 --> 11:22.800
Well, there must be
some mistake.

11:22.800 --> 11:26.140
Well, either way,
can we reschedule?

11:27.180 --> 11:29.550
What do you mean, "no"?

11:32.390 --> 11:33.390
Who's she?

11:33.390 --> 11:36.090
It's all right.
She's with us.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.140
Bodyguards? So that
answers my question,

11:39.140 --> 11:40.430
"You meant that
Cal Medina?"

11:40.430 --> 11:41.970
Yeah, since he's
been in the news,

11:41.970 --> 11:43.260
he's gotten a lot
of death threats.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.300
I'd surround myself
with security, too.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.010
Yeah. Only you
wouldn't have to,

11:47.010 --> 11:49.090
because you wouldn't
try to get rich

11:49.090 --> 11:51.470
by exploiting sick people.

11:53.090 --> 11:55.890
I've never even heard
of Leland Frisk,

11:55.890 --> 11:58.390
let alone hired him
to commit murder.

11:58.390 --> 12:01.930
The words sound laughable
coming out of my mouth.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.260
Actually, I agree.

12:03.260 --> 12:05.090
Denying you knew him
does sound silly,

12:05.090 --> 12:08.010
because we found a fingerprint
at the scene of his murder

12:08.010 --> 12:09.600
that matches one of yours
we lifted

12:09.600 --> 12:11.800
off a coffee mug
from your office.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.890
You've been to my office?

12:13.890 --> 12:15.760
Yeah. Your employees
were super nice.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.140
I got the sense they
don't like you any more

12:18.140 --> 12:19.090
than the public does.

12:19.090 --> 12:20.930
So, then this is all
based on a fingerprint

12:20.930 --> 12:23.090
you obtained with the help
of people who hate me.

12:23.090 --> 12:26.090
HOLMES:
Actually, it's not just a
fingerprint. Not anymore.

12:26.090 --> 12:27.260
You'll also have
to explain this.

12:27.260 --> 12:30.800
Sciacchetrà. It's the same wine
used to poison Frisk.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.090
HOLMES:
Also the same producer

12:32.090 --> 12:35.390
and batch number as the bottle
that we found at the scene.

12:35.390 --> 12:36.800
Mr. Medina
has a case of it.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.090
So, is it
a personal favorite?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.390
I hear it can be cloying.

12:39.390 --> 12:42.050
This murder you're trying
to pin on me,

12:42.050 --> 12:43.010
when did it happen?

12:43.010 --> 12:45.800
Last night, between
8:00 and 10:00.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.090
Good. I was here.

12:47.090 --> 12:52.010
And if we said "two nights ago,
between 11:00 and midnight"?

12:52.010 --> 12:54.350
First rule of negotiating.

12:54.350 --> 12:57.090
"He who speaks first loses."

12:57.300 --> 13:00.090
I was here entertaining
a guest last night.

13:00.090 --> 13:02.350
And though I can tell
you don't believe me,

13:02.350 --> 13:06.600
you'll have a much
harder time ignoring her.

13:10.760 --> 13:13.090
Assemblywoman Liz Kirkland
is one of the few

13:13.090 --> 13:15.640
politicians in the state
whose polls consistently

13:15.640 --> 13:18.090
rank her as trustworthy
and likable.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.390
BELL:
She backed Medina's story.

13:19.390 --> 13:21.050
Said she was with him all night.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.510
You don't believe her.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.550
Considering the money
his company's

13:24.550 --> 13:25.720
given her campaigns,

13:25.720 --> 13:28.090
she's in both Medina's pocket
and his pants.

13:28.090 --> 13:30.090
Makes sense
she'd lie for him.

13:30.090 --> 13:31.850
Still, she makes a good witness.

13:31.850 --> 13:34.600
I also got a text from the lab
while I was in there.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.510
Turns out the second
partial print on that wine glass

13:37.510 --> 13:38.640
isn't a match for Medina.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.010
That's not necessarily
a surprise, right?

13:41.010 --> 13:43.090
You guys are still running
elimination prints.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.090
Could turn out to be

13:44.090 --> 13:45.890
someone on the building's
cleaning staff.

13:45.890 --> 13:48.680
Don't get me wrong.
Medina makes my skin crawl.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.550
But a second fingerprint
and Ms. Kirkland's testimony?

13:51.550 --> 13:54.300
No way will the D.A. want
to take this to court.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.600
Then we'll just have
to get him for

13:55.600 --> 13:57.090
the other murder
he had a hand in.

13:57.090 --> 13:58.720
The one he hired
Leland Frisk

13:58.720 --> 13:59.890
to commit in 2014.

13:59.890 --> 14:01.800
We don't even know
who the victim was.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.100
We don't know
who the victim was yet.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.510
You're suggesting
that we identify,

14:05.510 --> 14:06.680
and then solve an unknown murder

14:06.680 --> 14:10.090
that an expert hit man
got away with four years ago.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.760
I am. Yeah.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.390
That is for Marybeth,
my caseworker.

14:16.390 --> 14:20.000
The agency is rejecting my
application for adoption.

14:20.650 --> 14:22.850
Why?
Because I missed
two appointments.

14:22.850 --> 14:24.940
The home visit
that I thought was yesterday

14:24.940 --> 14:26.650
and a parenting class last week.

14:26.650 --> 14:30.560
They said that it shows
I don't care enough about this.

14:31.150 --> 14:32.150
All right.

14:32.150 --> 14:34.060
Not ideal,
but we'll put together

14:34.060 --> 14:36.020
a new list of agencies
and start over.

14:36.020 --> 14:39.560
Learn from our mistakes
and move on.

14:39.560 --> 14:40.770
"Learn from our mistakes"?

14:40.770 --> 14:43.190
Gary, these were your mistakes,
not mine.

14:43.390 --> 14:45.260
You're managing
the schedule.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.900
You gave me the wrong
date for the home visit,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.620
and you never even told
me about the class.

14:48.620 --> 14:51.490
Whoa, whoa, Joan.
You're a busy woman.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.830
We both knew that going in.

14:52.830 --> 14:54.500
What is that supposed to mean?

14:54.500 --> 14:56.160
No, it-it means that you can't

14:56.160 --> 14:58.330
really say
who's to blame for this.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.290
Ultimately,
it's your responsibility

15:00.290 --> 15:01.490
to stay on top
of things.

15:01.490 --> 15:04.040
If you didn't trust me,
you should have confirmed

15:04.040 --> 15:05.950
the dates directly
with the agency.

15:05.950 --> 15:07.490
I did trust you.
Check your notes.

15:07.490 --> 15:08.490
See what they say right now.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.830
No. Joan, I'm sorry.
That's not how it works.

15:10.830 --> 15:11.910
I'm not gonna pull an assistant

15:11.910 --> 15:14.660
off other important work
to dig out your notes

15:14.660 --> 15:16.490
while you sit here
and wait.

15:16.490 --> 15:17.700
You're not our only client.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.490
And besides,
depending on what it says,

15:19.490 --> 15:21.490
you might need a chance
to cover yourself.

15:21.490 --> 15:23.490
Listen, Gary,
I don't want to sue you.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.450
Okay, I just want you
to call the agency

15:25.450 --> 15:27.410
and tell them that these
were your mistakes.

15:27.410 --> 15:29.490
Keep them from dropping me.
Make this right.

15:29.490 --> 15:34.080
I will make it right--
by helping you start over.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.160
Joan, it's a difference
of a few months.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.490
You've waited this long.

15:39.490 --> 15:42.490
It's not the end of the world.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.540
WATSON:
First, dollhouses;

15:48.540 --> 15:49.870
now Mystery Date.

15:49.870 --> 15:51.330
Are we having a sleepover?

15:51.330 --> 15:53.490
Unlike our typical usage
of Mr. Silhouette,

15:53.490 --> 15:55.160
today he is employed in the role

15:55.160 --> 15:57.620
of victim rather
than killer.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.330
It is an interesting challenge.

15:59.330 --> 16:00.500
How does one solve a murder

16:00.500 --> 16:03.410
that one can only know happened
through inference?

16:03.410 --> 16:07.120
Cal Medina hired
contract killer Leland Frisk.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.040
Ipso facto,
there must be someone

16:09.040 --> 16:10.620
Medina wanted Frisk to kill.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.540
I would include the possibility
that Frisk failed,

16:12.540 --> 16:14.450
but given his track record
and the efforts

16:14.450 --> 16:16.160
that Medina went to
to eliminate evidence,

16:16.160 --> 16:18.410
I think we can
rule that one out.

16:18.410 --> 16:19.660
"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

16:19.660 --> 16:22.490
September 18th
through the 20th, 2014."

16:22.490 --> 16:23.790
The place and window of time

16:23.790 --> 16:25.830
in which our mystery murder
occurred.

16:25.830 --> 16:27.580
The records that Marcus
and I were able

16:27.580 --> 16:29.870
to obtain from Frisk's
assistant, Miss Lennox,

16:29.870 --> 16:33.790
included his travel
while under Medina's employ.

16:33.790 --> 16:37.080
So you're reconstructing
what he was doing then

16:37.080 --> 16:39.250
so you can figure out
who he wanted dead.

16:39.250 --> 16:41.330
Precisely.
I take it you're familiar

16:41.330 --> 16:43.660
with the term,
"orphan diseases"?

16:43.660 --> 16:44.790
Uh, yeah. They're conditions

16:44.790 --> 16:46.490
that only affect
a small number of people,

16:46.490 --> 16:49.490
so there's not a lot of money
to be made in treating them.

16:49.490 --> 16:51.450
They're called "orphans"
because no one wants

16:51.450 --> 16:53.160
to take responsibility for them.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.290
Even the name is Dickensian,

16:54.290 --> 16:56.040
which I suppose
gives it points for honesty.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.490
If corporate America
had its way,

16:57.490 --> 17:01.040
we'd only take care of our sick
when there was money in it.

17:01.040 --> 17:01.830
It is repugnant.

17:01.830 --> 17:03.700
And being a walking embodiment
of that repugnance,

17:03.700 --> 17:07.700
Cal Medina found himself
a niche in orphan drugs,

17:07.700 --> 17:11.490
aka the medicines used
to treat orphan diseases.

17:11.490 --> 17:12.579
In the summer of 2014,

17:12.579 --> 17:15.119
Medina's company,
Calculus Pharmaceutical,

17:15.119 --> 17:17.200
acquired the rights to

17:17.200 --> 17:18.829
trifloxazole,
an antibiotic

17:18.829 --> 17:20.490
used for chronic
bacterial infections

17:20.490 --> 17:22.700
associated with cystic fibrosis.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.410
I remember this.

17:24.410 --> 17:27.410
Back then, it was cheap
and readily available.

17:27.410 --> 17:28.580
Which enabled Medina to buy low.

17:28.580 --> 17:29.830
But after he
bought the rights,

17:29.830 --> 17:33.620
he raised the price
to almost $1,000 a pill.

17:33.620 --> 17:34.870
You're right-- it's gross.

17:34.870 --> 17:36.330
Cystic fibrosis
is genetic.

17:36.330 --> 17:38.040
I mean, children
are born with it.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.620
They spend their whole lives
vulnerable to infection.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.540
They don't have a choice.
They need the drug.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.500
Which is why enough people
still buy the drug

17:43.500 --> 17:45.330
at that price
to make it profitable.

17:45.330 --> 17:46.410
And if you can't afford hundreds

17:46.410 --> 17:47.910
of thousands of dollars
a year in medicine,

17:47.910 --> 17:50.250
well, you just shouldn't
have been born sick,

17:50.250 --> 17:51.120
should you?

17:51.120 --> 17:52.370
Now, the question is:

17:52.370 --> 17:53.500
Did anyone need killing

17:53.500 --> 17:56.000
in order to facilitate
Medina's profits?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.950
Thus far,
I've only identified that

17:57.950 --> 18:00.410
as the most promising area
in which to look.

18:00.410 --> 18:03.870
Marcus, meanwhile,
is assembling a list of deaths--

18:03.870 --> 18:06.290
suspicious or otherwise--
in Pittsburgh

18:06.290 --> 18:07.500
during the dates in question.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.370
I've also yet to determine
why you didn't tell me

18:10.370 --> 18:13.660
about your home visit
being canceled.

18:14.450 --> 18:15.290
Your caseworker,

18:15.290 --> 18:17.490
Marybeth,
she applies her eau de toilette

18:17.490 --> 18:18.830
with a heavy hand.

18:18.830 --> 18:21.200
She didn't come here yesterday.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.200
So, is something wrong?

18:28.410 --> 18:31.490
Of course I know the fault lies
with your lawyer and not you.

18:31.490 --> 18:33.870
I know you too well
to imagine otherwise.

18:33.870 --> 18:35.830
Well, the problem is,
it's "he said, she said."

18:35.830 --> 18:38.120
And the adoption agency
has been working with Gary

18:38.120 --> 18:40.080
for a long time,
so they're gonna believe him.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.660
And if he's worried
about me suing him,

18:41.660 --> 18:43.910
he's had plenty of time
to change his notes

18:43.910 --> 18:45.490
so that everything looks right.

18:45.490 --> 18:49.290
I don't understand why you were
so hesitant to tell me.

18:49.290 --> 18:50.040
Because I know you.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.660
You're gonna want
to go nuclear on the guy,

18:51.660 --> 18:54.490
and I haven't even decided
what I want to do yet.

18:54.490 --> 18:55.660
What's to decide?

18:55.660 --> 18:56.490
We're us.

18:56.490 --> 18:58.620
If we wanted to,
we could break into his place,

18:58.620 --> 19:00.790
and then find proof
that he was at fault,

19:00.790 --> 19:02.910
and then share it
with the agency.

19:02.910 --> 19:04.120
So far, so good.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.120
If we hurt his reputation,

19:05.120 --> 19:06.490
we could hurt
his other clients,

19:06.490 --> 19:08.490
and I'm not sure
I'm willing to do that.

19:08.490 --> 19:12.120
Maybe I can live with
being set back a few months.

19:12.120 --> 19:16.500
It's not just that you haven't
decided what you want to do.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.250
You didn't trust
that I'd follow your lead.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.580
No, it's not... (sighs)

19:20.580 --> 19:22.580
Look, when I told you
I was going to adopt,

19:22.580 --> 19:25.330
I promised you that I was
gonna do it by myself.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.750
But then you were
talking the other night

19:26.750 --> 19:27.910
about getting
the house ready,

19:27.910 --> 19:30.790
and it sounded like...

19:31.830 --> 19:33.410
...you felt you needed
to co-parent.

19:33.410 --> 19:35.540
And I don't want you to feel
that kind of pressure.

19:35.540 --> 19:38.040
'Cause I do so poorly
in high-pressure situations?

19:38.040 --> 19:40.870
This is gonna change things
for me a lot.

19:40.870 --> 19:42.870
But if I feel like it's gonna
change too much for you,

19:42.870 --> 19:45.370
then I'm worried I'm not gonna
go through with this.

19:45.370 --> 19:48.700
And I-I want
to go through with this.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.490
Does that make any sense?

19:51.950 --> 19:54.910
I will abide by your wishes
with Gary,

19:54.910 --> 19:57.120
whatever they may be.

19:57.490 --> 20:01.200
Even if it's for me
to stay out of it.

20:03.950 --> 20:05.160
Just you?
HOLMES: Yeah.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.830
You got something on that
name I asked you to look up?

20:07.830 --> 20:09.660
Peter Romano?
You're thinking that's the guy

20:09.660 --> 20:11.490
Medina had
Leland Frisk kill?

20:11.490 --> 20:12.500
Peter Romano was
a researcher

20:12.500 --> 20:14.490
working in the area
of cystic fibrosis.

20:14.490 --> 20:17.080
In early 2014, he
claimed he'd identified

20:17.080 --> 20:19.830
a new treatment for the
same bacterial infection

20:19.830 --> 20:22.490
that Cal Medina was about
to corner the market on.

20:22.490 --> 20:25.540
But Romano never lived to
publish what he'd found.

20:25.540 --> 20:27.870
Instead, whilst attending
a medical conference

20:27.870 --> 20:29.290
in Pittsburgh that September,

20:29.290 --> 20:31.000
he was found dead
in his hotel room.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.490
Well, I reached out
to Pittsburgh PD.

20:33.490 --> 20:35.500
According to them,
the cause of death

20:35.500 --> 20:36.700
was accidental
asphyxiation.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.450
Romano had ordered
room service.

20:38.450 --> 20:39.200
The M.E. found

20:39.200 --> 20:40.580
french fries lodged
in his windpipe,

20:40.580 --> 20:42.370
and there was no sign
of foul play.

20:42.370 --> 20:43.750
Now, the case detective
gave me his number,

20:43.750 --> 20:45.830
said you could call him
if you needed anything.

20:45.830 --> 20:48.500
Won't be necessary.
The M.E. got it wrong.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.700
That was quick.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.490
Peter Romano was
suffocated first.

20:51.490 --> 20:55.040
The french fries were jammed
down his throat postmortem.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.330
It's very, very subtle,

20:56.330 --> 20:59.620
but note the bruising
around his mouth.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.910
That's the mark left
by that weird weapon

21:01.910 --> 21:03.490
Frisk had at the office.

21:03.490 --> 21:04.950
The Incubus?

21:04.950 --> 21:06.200
You were right.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.490
Peter Romano
was assassinated.

21:08.490 --> 21:10.120
Shouldn't affect
the third quarter.

21:10.120 --> 21:10.910
This is the man

21:10.910 --> 21:12.540
that you hired
Leland Frisk to kill.

21:12.540 --> 21:13.700
His name was Peter Romano.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.490
Romano had developed
a new treatment

21:15.490 --> 21:16.450
for cystic fibrosis.

21:16.450 --> 21:17.660
If he'd lived
to share it, no one

21:17.660 --> 21:19.580
would have to pay the
thousand bucks a pill

21:19.580 --> 21:22.120
for your drug, and
you'd be out of luck.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.200
Uh, pardon us, will you?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.660
I want you both to remember
my face right now.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.490
I want you to remember me
memorizing your badge number.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.700
Well, you're welcome to it.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.490
I told you my name
before, too,

21:33.490 --> 21:35.370
but you probably
weren't listening.

21:35.370 --> 21:36.450
It's Marcus Bell.

21:36.450 --> 21:38.250
MEDINA:
And I'm going to call my lawyer

21:38.250 --> 21:39.490
and have him destroy you both.

21:39.490 --> 21:41.500
I see your sommelier
is changing the wine glasses.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.120
Did you ask him
to do that?

21:44.120 --> 21:44.910
Are you joking?

21:44.910 --> 21:47.450
Is that what you care about--
our table service?

21:47.450 --> 21:48.660
Well, it's long been
an axiom of mine

21:48.660 --> 21:51.410
that the little things are
infinitely the most important.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.490
Just humor me-- did you?

21:52.490 --> 21:54.000
They brought us
Chardonnay glasses,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.410
and we are drinking
Pinot Noir.

21:56.410 --> 21:57.750
Why does it matter?

21:57.750 --> 21:58.910
Well, I'm not sure that it does.

21:58.910 --> 22:01.250
Before you run us out of town,
could you give us

22:01.250 --> 22:03.870
a list of the restaurants
that you frequent?

22:04.450 --> 22:06.250
What am I supposed to see here?

22:06.250 --> 22:07.330
Uh, among other things,

22:07.330 --> 22:09.410
more appropriate
glasses for sciacchetrà

22:09.410 --> 22:11.830
than the ones used
to poison Leland Frisk.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.500
WATSON: Frisk's office
had dessert wine glasses,

22:13.500 --> 22:16.200
but whoever poured
the sciacchetrà

22:16.200 --> 22:17.500
used standard ones
instead.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.540
Cal Medina is, amongst
other things, a wine snob.

22:19.540 --> 22:22.160
He would never have stood
for the use of such glasses.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.580
You ever consider maybe Frisk
picked the glasses,

22:24.580 --> 22:27.490
and seeing as Medina
was there to kill the guy,

22:27.490 --> 22:28.500
he just kept his mouth shut?

22:28.500 --> 22:31.080
You ask that because
you haven't met Cal Medina.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.490
BELL:
That said,

22:32.490 --> 22:33.490
we did consider it.

22:33.490 --> 22:35.620
And we think the truth
goes even farther.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.700
We don't think Medina
was there at all.

22:37.700 --> 22:41.290
We found out who the other
print on the glass belongs to.

22:41.290 --> 22:44.080
It was a waitress from one
of Medina's regular spots.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.500
The glass we found
at Frisk's office

22:45.500 --> 22:49.290
was stolen from that restaurant,
with Medina's prints on it.

22:49.290 --> 22:50.290
In other words,

22:50.290 --> 22:52.250
Medina has an alibi
for Frisk's murder

22:52.250 --> 22:53.790
because he was framed.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.330
By who?

22:55.660 --> 22:58.250
This is security video

22:58.250 --> 22:59.490
from that restaurant,

22:59.490 --> 23:02.790
taken three days
before Frisk's murder.

23:02.790 --> 23:04.160
That's Medina in the top left.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.750
The waitress clears the glasses
from his table

23:06.750 --> 23:09.700
and brings them
to a bussing station.

23:10.750 --> 23:13.490
GREGSON:
That's the victim, Frisk.

23:13.490 --> 23:14.620
HOLMES:
It is.

23:14.620 --> 23:18.120
You're saying the hit man,
Leland Frisk,

23:18.120 --> 23:19.490
poisoned himself,

23:19.490 --> 23:21.830
and then framed
Cal Medina for it?

23:23.040 --> 23:24.040
Why?

23:24.040 --> 23:25.700
We have no idea.

23:27.410 --> 23:29.490
BELL: Once we figured out
what your boss had done,

23:29.490 --> 23:30.620
we wondered
how he got his hands on

23:30.620 --> 23:32.290
the same batch of sciacchetrà
that Medina had.

23:32.290 --> 23:34.990
Medina's place is
guarded like a fortress.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Didn't seem likely
he stole it from there.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.330
So we asked Medina
where he got his.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.990
The cashier at the wine store
remembered you

23:42.990 --> 23:45.500
stepping up to the counter
just minutes

23:45.500 --> 23:47.450
after Medina
bought his case.

23:47.450 --> 23:49.450
You wanted to make sure
they gave you

23:49.450 --> 23:51.500
the exact same wine
they just sold him.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.000
HOLMES:
You were following him.
You helped Frisk

23:54.000 --> 23:54.990
set up the frame.

23:54.990 --> 23:56.790
Which means you lied to us.

23:56.790 --> 23:58.500
Probably about
a lot of things.

23:58.500 --> 23:59.990
For starters, you obviously knew

23:59.990 --> 24:01.990
a lot more about Leland
than you let on.

24:01.990 --> 24:05.290
And if we're right, it was
part of your job to make sure

24:05.290 --> 24:06.500
we looked at Medina.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.290
So, if you want
to help yourself,

24:08.290 --> 24:09.990
it's time to start
telling the truth.

24:09.990 --> 24:14.080
Why did Leland want to frame
Medina for his murder?

24:14.080 --> 24:15.830
That's not what he wanted.

24:15.830 --> 24:17.080
At least not at first.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.620
What he wanted was for Medina
to get arrested

24:20.620 --> 24:23.040
for ordering
Peter Romano's murder.

24:23.040 --> 24:24.830
The thing is...

24:24.830 --> 24:26.040
Leland didn't kill Romano.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.580
He never even worked
for Medina at all.

24:28.580 --> 24:30.330
We found a device
in Leland's office

24:30.330 --> 24:32.950
we're pretty sure was used
to kill Romano.

24:32.950 --> 24:34.250
Looks like an oxygen mask

24:34.250 --> 24:36.250
connected to
a bicycle pump, right?

24:36.250 --> 24:39.250
Leland built that himself
a few weeks ago.

24:39.250 --> 24:40.660
He wanted you to find it.

24:40.660 --> 24:43.950
He knew it would help you think
what he wanted you to think.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.750
(machinery whirring)
BELL: That Medina
hired Leland

24:46.750 --> 24:47.910
to kill Romano in 2014

24:47.910 --> 24:49.250
and that Medina
killed Leland

24:49.250 --> 24:52.000
three nights ago
to cover it up?

24:52.000 --> 24:55.580
Why did Leland have it out
for Medina at all?

24:55.580 --> 24:58.250
Think I can
answer that.

24:59.410 --> 25:02.790
Your son suffers from
cystic fibrosis.

25:03.200 --> 25:07.160
Correction:
uh, yours and Leland's son.

25:09.330 --> 25:11.660
Hayden was diagnosed
when he was three,

25:11.660 --> 25:14.990
and Leland
cared about nothing else.

25:14.990 --> 25:17.660
He made sure Hayden
had the best doctors.

25:17.660 --> 25:19.040
He researched everything.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.990
When the cost of
the drug went up,

25:20.990 --> 25:23.080
he took care of that.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.750
But it was hard.

25:24.750 --> 25:25.790
Then, a few months ago,

25:25.790 --> 25:27.870
he read something online
about Peter Romano.

25:27.870 --> 25:30.330
Uh, a rumor
that Romano had found

25:30.330 --> 25:31.830
a less expensive treatment

25:31.830 --> 25:33.990
but died
before he could publish.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.120
I didn't understand why,

25:35.120 --> 25:38.990
but to Leland,
it seemed suspicious.

25:38.990 --> 25:40.990
And somehow he got his hands on

25:40.990 --> 25:42.830
the police report
from Romano's death.

25:42.830 --> 25:44.990
He recognized the work
of another killer.

25:44.990 --> 25:47.870
And he understood
implicitly who stood

25:47.870 --> 25:50.450
to benefit from the hit:
Cal Medina.

25:50.450 --> 25:53.990
That's when Leland told me
what he really did.

25:53.990 --> 25:56.790
That he, uh,
killed people for money.

25:56.790 --> 25:57.910
I couldn't believe it.

25:57.910 --> 26:00.790
But then he showed
me his files, and...

26:01.540 --> 26:05.540
After that,
he became obsessed with Medina.

26:05.540 --> 26:06.660
He read that Medina's own board

26:06.660 --> 26:08.330
hated that they were
price gouging.

26:08.330 --> 26:10.990
One of the execs who resigned
told a reporter

26:10.990 --> 26:13.950
that the entire company
would stop doing it

26:13.950 --> 26:15.450
if Medina was gone.

26:15.450 --> 26:16.700
So Leland spent months

26:16.700 --> 26:19.250
trying to prove
that Medina was guilty,

26:19.250 --> 26:21.200
that he paid someone
to kill Romano.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.990
Imagine he
would've gone after

26:22.990 --> 26:23.990
Medina himself.

26:23.990 --> 26:26.120
But Medina's security
was too strong

26:26.120 --> 26:28.990
because he'd already received
dozens of death threats.

26:28.990 --> 26:30.500
That's when the
FBI happened.

26:30.500 --> 26:34.160
One of Leland's
former clients called.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.990
Uh, an Agent, uh, Kerner,

26:36.990 --> 26:40.080
asking about some work
that he had done.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.790
It seemed that she knew
about another job, as well.

26:42.790 --> 26:48.580
So, if she found the payments
to Leland from both companies...

26:48.580 --> 26:49.500
They'd have him.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.410
His time to get Medina
was running out.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.410
So, he couldn't
kill Medina,

26:52.410 --> 26:56.500
but he could kill himself
and frame Medina,

26:56.500 --> 26:59.580
and then hopefully achieve
the same outcome.

26:59.580 --> 27:01.000
Medina would go
to prison,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.250
his board would remove him
as head of the company,

27:03.250 --> 27:06.620
and the drug for your son
and other kids like him

27:06.620 --> 27:08.950
would become affordable again.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.330
Well, now
that we know

27:10.330 --> 27:13.750
what Leland
was attempting to do,

27:13.750 --> 27:16.370
I wish it had worked.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.200
Marcus called.

27:22.200 --> 27:25.000
The D.A. is not gonna press
charges against Sherry Lennox.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.000
As far as the police
and the FBI can tell,

27:27.090 --> 27:28.090
she told you the truth.

27:28.090 --> 27:30.260
She did not help Frisk
commit any murders.

27:30.260 --> 27:31.680
What is all this?

27:31.680 --> 27:32.720
This is Leland Frisk's obsession

27:32.720 --> 27:34.090
during the final months
of his life.

27:34.090 --> 27:37.220
His research on Cal Medina,
and the murder of Peter Romano.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.550
Sherry let me
have all of it.

27:39.550 --> 27:41.350
Attendee lists
from the convention

27:41.350 --> 27:42.470
that Romano was visiting;

27:42.470 --> 27:45.300
employee names from the hotel
where he was killed;

27:45.300 --> 27:47.050
and Medina's phone, banking

27:47.050 --> 27:49.850
and credit card records
from 2014.

27:49.850 --> 27:51.600
Wow. How'd he get all this?

27:51.600 --> 27:53.090
Sherry couldn't say.

27:53.090 --> 27:56.090
It's possible
that a contract killer

27:56.090 --> 27:57.510
of Frisk's longevity

27:57.510 --> 27:59.970
developed some hacking skills
along the way.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.140
Or, being well-versed
at blackmail,

28:01.140 --> 28:03.430
it's possible he compelled
someone to help him.

28:03.430 --> 28:05.470
Anyway, he was
unable to identify

28:05.470 --> 28:07.010
Romano's actual killer

28:07.010 --> 28:08.260
or prove that Medina
ordered the hit.

28:08.260 --> 28:10.680
So I thought I might spot
something that he missed.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.180
You want some help?
I mean, it's not every day

28:13.180 --> 28:14.850
we try to help a hit man.

28:14.850 --> 28:16.970
Well, I was struck
by the same thought.

28:16.970 --> 28:19.260
Leland Frisk was,
without doubt, an evil man,

28:19.260 --> 28:21.050
but towards the end
of his life,

28:21.050 --> 28:22.850
he attempted to do
one noble thing,

28:22.850 --> 28:25.140
and I, for one,
would like to see it done.

28:25.140 --> 28:27.720
Was he being noble?

28:28.090 --> 28:29.090
I'm just saying, I mean,

28:29.090 --> 28:30.720
getting rid of Medina
would have helped

28:30.720 --> 28:33.010
a lot of people,
but it's possible that Frisk

28:33.010 --> 28:35.300
was only thinking
of his own son.

28:35.300 --> 28:36.930
Does it matter?

28:37.350 --> 28:39.050
Frisk's insurance files,

28:39.050 --> 28:40.800
though abhorrent,
do speak to a man

28:40.800 --> 28:44.090
who spent decades looking back
over one shoulder,

28:44.090 --> 28:45.760
never able to shake his past.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.050
Never able to forget
a single heinous act.

28:48.050 --> 28:52.430
It is possible that such a thing
could lead a man to take stock.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.220
(doorbell ringing)

28:54.220 --> 28:56.010
You expecting someone?

28:56.010 --> 28:58.090
I invited a guest,
in order to put an option

28:58.090 --> 29:00.140
in your hands with regards
to your attorney.

29:00.140 --> 29:01.510
This is you staying out of it?

29:01.510 --> 29:02.800
Actually, it is,
because the choice

29:02.800 --> 29:05.260
of what to do with what
I'm about to provide

29:05.260 --> 29:07.090
will be entirely yours.

29:07.090 --> 29:10.090
Yours and King Wilhelm's.

29:10.090 --> 29:12.430
King who?

29:13.100 --> 29:15.300
Your Majesty, this is

29:15.300 --> 29:16.550
Dr. Joan Watson.

29:16.550 --> 29:17.930
Dr. Watson,

29:17.930 --> 29:19.510
may I introduce His Majesty

29:19.510 --> 29:21.510
Wilhelm Gottsreich
Sigismond von Ormstein,

29:21.510 --> 29:26.090
Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein
and Hereditary King of Bohemia.

29:26.090 --> 29:28.090
Please.

29:33.090 --> 29:35.010
This is an actual king?

29:35.010 --> 29:36.300
Yes, albeit a king
without a kingdom,

29:36.300 --> 29:38.720
since Bohemia ceased to exist
over a hundred years ago.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.390
It's a familial title now,
along with some retained wealth,

29:41.390 --> 29:43.140
neither of which
he would still have

29:43.140 --> 29:44.470
were it not for my father.

29:44.470 --> 29:47.760
I knew that the king
frequently visited New York,

29:47.760 --> 29:49.890
uh, thanks to
the great many

29:49.890 --> 29:51.090
courtesans that he favors here,

29:51.090 --> 29:54.050
so I asked for a moment
of his time.

29:54.050 --> 29:56.680
And this has to do with Gary?

29:56.680 --> 29:58.220
Gary, an attorney

29:58.220 --> 29:59.850
of questionable
character.

29:59.850 --> 30:03.090
It will.
If I may, I'll get right to it.

30:03.090 --> 30:03.720
Oh.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.100
Are you familiar, Majesty,

30:05.100 --> 30:06.850
with the practice
of one adult

30:06.850 --> 30:07.680
adopting another adult,

30:07.680 --> 30:10.090
for the purpose
of passing lineage?

30:10.090 --> 30:12.220
I confess, I am not.

30:12.220 --> 30:13.890
Forgive me for saying so,

30:13.890 --> 30:15.930
but I suspected
you might not be.

30:15.930 --> 30:18.850
The notion, I believe,
is self-explanatory.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.300
There are rarely
age restrictions

30:20.300 --> 30:21.300
placed upon adoption,

30:21.300 --> 30:25.890
and so one adult becomes
the legal parent of another.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.100
It's come to my attention
that your son

30:28.100 --> 30:30.090
is familiar
with this practice.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.090
According to my research,

30:32.090 --> 30:34.970
Prince Havel has,
to date, adopted

30:34.970 --> 30:38.100
18 men and women, for fees
of 100,000 euros apiece,

30:38.100 --> 30:41.550
in exchange for bestowing
your family name upon them.

30:41.550 --> 30:42.680
Really?

30:42.680 --> 30:43.720
I'm afraid so.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.470
As we speak,
there are a dozen and a half

30:46.470 --> 30:47.850
newly minted dukes and duchesses

30:47.850 --> 30:51.090
using their titles to gain
entrée to some of Europe's

30:51.090 --> 30:53.510
most exclusive circles.

30:53.510 --> 30:55.600
And Gary was the attorney

30:55.600 --> 30:56.430
who arranged

30:56.430 --> 30:58.800
all of those adoptions.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.090
I see.

31:00.090 --> 31:02.050
I'd always envied

31:02.050 --> 31:04.090
your father his
sons, Sherlock.

31:04.090 --> 31:07.930
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I know things were never easy.

31:07.930 --> 31:12.090
But neither you nor your brother
was an idiot.

31:13.090 --> 31:18.090
My son is an idiot.

31:19.350 --> 31:20.220
Very well.

31:20.220 --> 31:24.180
I have always relied
on the counsel of the Holmeses.

31:24.180 --> 31:28.600
I see no reason that
today is different.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.090
What do you propose I do?

31:31.090 --> 31:34.010
Well, actually, Your Majesty,
I believe that's a question

31:34.010 --> 31:37.090
best posed to my partner.

31:40.470 --> 31:41.220
There you are.

31:41.220 --> 31:44.090
Agent Kerner said you asked her
to meet us both here?

31:44.090 --> 31:45.800
I did. Thanks
for coming.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.470
I think what I have
in mind will require

31:47.470 --> 31:50.100
the assistance of both
the NYPD and the FBI.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.090
What you have in mind?

31:52.090 --> 31:53.350
Give him a minute.

31:53.350 --> 31:54.260
It's usually worth it.

31:54.260 --> 31:56.180
Last night,
I had an epiphany.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.260
Watson and I were discussing

31:57.260 --> 31:59.050
the insurance files
that Leland Frisk kept.

31:59.050 --> 32:01.090
It occurred to me,
the impulse that inspired him

32:01.090 --> 32:03.680
to keep those files
couldn't be unique.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.930
What if other hit men
took similar precautions?

32:05.930 --> 32:09.470
Okay, but what are we supposed
to do with that epiphany?

32:09.470 --> 32:11.390
We're gonna finish
what Frisk started.

32:11.390 --> 32:15.800
We're going to incite a hit
on Cal Medina.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.680
BELL:
Cal Medina.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.180
This is
Captain Gregson.

32:28.050 --> 32:29.090
I called it.

32:29.090 --> 32:30.640
You called what?

32:30.640 --> 32:31.930
Well, it's just,
the captain and I

32:31.930 --> 32:33.390
were debating whether
you'd show up here

32:33.390 --> 32:35.140
with or without
a lawyer.

32:35.140 --> 32:36.680
He figured
you were too smart

32:36.680 --> 32:38.300
to talk to the cops
by yourself.

32:38.300 --> 32:39.640
I said lawyers
usually want

32:39.640 --> 32:41.140
to keep their clients
from talking,

32:41.140 --> 32:43.350
so I bet you'd show up
without one.

32:43.350 --> 32:44.090
I was right.

32:44.090 --> 32:47.760
You think I enjoy the
sound of my own voice.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.090
I don't disagree.

32:49.090 --> 32:51.090
But my lawyer is
very good at his job,

32:51.090 --> 32:54.090
and so I enjoy listening
to his voice, too.

32:54.090 --> 32:56.090
And I assure you,
he'll be here shortly.

32:56.090 --> 32:59.010
Listen, before we get too
far off on the wrong foot,

32:59.010 --> 33:00.090
the reason we
brought you here

33:00.090 --> 33:02.260
is because we owe
you an apology.

33:02.260 --> 33:03.600
Our investigation
revealed

33:03.600 --> 33:04.930
that you didn't kill
Leland Frisk

33:04.930 --> 33:07.260
and you didn't hire him
to kill anyone else.

33:07.260 --> 33:10.010
We were wrong
about all of that.

33:10.010 --> 33:11.180
Of course you were.

33:11.180 --> 33:12.640
The thing is,
that's not

33:12.640 --> 33:15.010
the only thing we have
to apologize for.

33:15.010 --> 33:17.720
(chuckles)
We almost got you killed.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.720
Excuse me?

33:19.720 --> 33:21.140
Uh, follow me.

33:21.140 --> 33:23.350
We'll explain.

33:24.260 --> 33:28.390
Any chance you recognize
the man facing us?

33:28.390 --> 33:29.090
I do not.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.300
Well, his name
is Tad Linsky,

33:30.300 --> 33:32.390
and the reason we thought
you might know him

33:32.390 --> 33:33.850
is 'cause he's
the guy you hired

33:33.850 --> 33:36.090
to kill Peter
Romano in 2014.

33:36.090 --> 33:36.970
Now, when we discovered

33:36.970 --> 33:38.970
Leland Frisk's body,
we also found evidence

33:38.970 --> 33:42.010
that he'd taken steps
to prevent any of his clients

33:42.010 --> 33:43.800
from outing him as a hit man.

33:43.800 --> 33:44.970
It occurred to our colleague,

33:44.970 --> 33:48.090
Mr. Holmes, that other hit men
had to have the same concern.

33:48.090 --> 33:50.680
They'd have to keep
their ear to the ground,

33:50.680 --> 33:51.800
keep tabs
on old clients,

33:51.800 --> 33:54.760
in case one of them
ever decided to give them up.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.090
So, with the help of the FBI,

33:57.090 --> 34:00.720
we leaked word to CIs
in every major city

34:00.720 --> 34:02.930
and put it out
on the Dark Web

34:02.930 --> 34:05.010
that you were looking
to cut a deal.

34:05.010 --> 34:06.350
Made it sound like
you were about

34:06.350 --> 34:09.050
to give up the name
of Romano's killer

34:09.050 --> 34:10.179
at any time.

34:10.179 --> 34:11.350
Then we sat back,

34:11.350 --> 34:13.510
waited to see who showed up
to kill you.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.929
We figured we weren't
putting you in too much danger.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.010
Leland Frisk was one of the best
at what he did,

34:18.010 --> 34:20.679
and he couldn't figure out
how to get a shot at you.

34:20.679 --> 34:24.600
Sure enough, Mr. Linsky
took the bait.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.219
Drove all the way
from Scranton

34:26.219 --> 34:28.679
and started
surveilling you.

34:28.679 --> 34:30.550
We had our guys pick him up.

34:30.550 --> 34:32.429
When they did,
he had a gun in his car

34:32.429 --> 34:35.550
that ballistics matched
to five unsolved murders.

34:35.550 --> 34:37.350
He went for a deal quick.

34:37.350 --> 34:39.090
And he's already given you up.

34:39.090 --> 34:44.050
I think I'll wait to speak
to my lawyer now.

34:45.090 --> 34:45.969
About that.

34:45.969 --> 34:47.929
The two other people
you see in there

34:47.929 --> 34:49.889
are from Pittsburgh PD
and the FBI.

34:49.889 --> 34:52.389
Since you didn't
commit the murder

34:52.389 --> 34:54.300
that we were
investigating you for,

34:54.300 --> 34:57.390
it's up to them who gets
first crack at you.

34:57.390 --> 34:59.550
Looks like
the Feds won.

34:59.550 --> 35:03.050
We'll let your lawyer
know when he gets here

35:03.050 --> 35:05.800
that you've been
taken into custody.

35:07.850 --> 35:11.180
(handcuffs clicking)

35:17.720 --> 35:18.550
Joan.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.100
I-I wasn't sure I was
gonna see you again.

35:21.100 --> 35:23.090
Well, if you play
your cards right,

35:23.090 --> 35:24.550
after today, you won't.

35:24.550 --> 35:26.090
What's that
supposed to mean?

35:26.090 --> 35:27.800
It means that I'm here
to talk to you

35:27.800 --> 35:31.050
about another client of yours,
Prince Havel of Bohemia,

35:31.050 --> 35:32.800
and how you've been helping him

35:32.800 --> 35:36.090
sell adult adoptions
to make money.

35:37.470 --> 35:39.550
According to Bohemian tradition,

35:39.550 --> 35:41.220
the passage of title
through adoption

35:41.220 --> 35:43.930
is not recognized
unless explicitly

35:43.930 --> 35:45.090
sanctioned by the king.

35:45.090 --> 35:46.800
And given how meticulous
you insist you are

35:46.800 --> 35:49.140
about details, I'm guessing
you knew that already.

35:49.140 --> 35:52.220
The problem is, the king
did not give his sanction.

35:52.220 --> 35:55.090
In fact, he was not aware
of the adoptions at all.

35:55.090 --> 35:59.550
How the hell would you know
what King Wilhelm of Bohemia

35:59.550 --> 36:01.510
was or wasn't aware of?

36:01.510 --> 36:04.090
Well, as it happens,
he's a friend of a friend.

36:04.090 --> 36:07.140
Now, this is a letter
to me from King Wilhelm,

36:07.140 --> 36:08.970
promising to wait
for my call

36:08.970 --> 36:11.300
before he decides what
to do about this.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.510
One way or another,

36:12.510 --> 36:16.090
he is going to undo
those 18 bogus titles.

36:16.090 --> 36:19.550
But there are two ways
he can go about it.

36:20.050 --> 36:22.850
"You need only say the word,
and I am prepared

36:22.850 --> 36:24.800
"to disown my son,
Prince Havel,

36:24.800 --> 36:28.090
as punishment for the disgrace
he's brought upon me."

36:28.090 --> 36:30.930
To be fair, I think he was
thinking of doing that anyway.

36:30.930 --> 36:34.100
Now, if he disowns his son,
he automatically disowns

36:34.100 --> 36:35.930
all adopted grandchildren, too.

36:35.930 --> 36:37.510
Now, that would be the
best option for you,

36:37.510 --> 36:38.890
because it leaves
you out of it.

36:38.890 --> 36:41.090
The other option
is he keeps his son

36:41.090 --> 36:42.390
but rejects all new titles.

36:42.390 --> 36:44.930
Now, if he does that,
it's a safe bet

36:44.930 --> 36:46.300
that all 18 adoptees

36:46.300 --> 36:48.640
will sue Prince
Havel for fraud.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.180
You will be named as
codefendant in the lawsuit

36:51.180 --> 36:55.090
and buried in legal fees
defending yourself.

36:56.090 --> 36:57.970
Did you ever even check
your notes

36:57.970 --> 37:00.430
to see who made those mistakes?

37:01.800 --> 37:05.470
So, why don't we do that
together now?

37:13.720 --> 37:18.180
I heard on the radio in the cab
that Cal Medina was arrested.

37:18.180 --> 37:19.350
Yes. Thanks to the news,

37:19.350 --> 37:23.890
the, uh, board of directors
has already removed him as CEO.

37:23.890 --> 37:25.010
If all goes well,

37:25.010 --> 37:28.050
then Sherry Lennox's son
and thousands like him

37:28.050 --> 37:30.100
might be able
to afford their medicine.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.550
So the hit man with
a heart of gold got his way.

37:33.550 --> 37:34.510
He did.

37:34.510 --> 37:36.090
Heart of gold or not.

37:36.090 --> 37:37.090
How was your attorney?

37:37.090 --> 37:40.090
He called the adoption agency
with me right there in the room,

37:40.090 --> 37:42.600
and he took full responsibility
for all of his mistakes.

37:42.600 --> 37:46.090
And then he gracefully bowed out
of representing me.

37:46.090 --> 37:47.850
Was the agency satisfied?

37:47.850 --> 37:49.010
Everything's back on track.

37:49.010 --> 37:50.600
They're working
with my new lawyer.

37:50.600 --> 37:55.220
No lost time; just the
appointments I have to make up.

37:56.010 --> 37:57.970
What do I smell?

38:00.300 --> 38:04.090
King Wilhelm sent over a
token of his appreciation.

38:04.090 --> 38:06.930
It's a traditional
Bohemian feast.

38:06.930 --> 38:09.430
Larded beef in
cream sauce,

38:09.430 --> 38:11.640
bread dumplings and
braised cabbage,

38:11.640 --> 38:12.720
schnitzel,

38:12.720 --> 38:15.720
some sort of
fried cheese.

38:15.720 --> 38:16.720
Hmm.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.430
Some of it sounds good.

38:20.930 --> 38:22.050
Look...

38:22.050 --> 38:25.260
I've never felt any pressure
from you that I co-parent.

38:25.260 --> 38:28.640
But your idea
that I take no responsibility

38:28.640 --> 38:30.800
in raising your child is naive.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.140
It's not that I think
you're not capable

38:33.140 --> 38:34.890
of raising a child on your own--

38:34.890 --> 38:36.350
of course you are-- but...

38:36.350 --> 38:38.350
short of us dissolving
our partnership,

38:38.350 --> 38:42.090
I'm not capable
of not being involved.

38:42.430 --> 38:43.890
N-Not as the child's father,

38:43.890 --> 38:46.350
but as its mother's friend.

38:47.300 --> 38:50.090
I mean, I'd lay down
my life for you.

38:50.390 --> 38:52.090
So, if you succeed
in adopting a child,

38:52.090 --> 38:54.100
I'll lay down my life
for him or her.

38:54.100 --> 38:58.180
It's... it's as simple as that.

38:59.720 --> 39:03.140
Have you thought about what you
want to be called by my kid?

39:03.140 --> 39:06.390
I mean, assuming I get one.

39:07.100 --> 39:09.890
I was thinking "Uncle Sherlock."

39:09.890 --> 39:13.010
Yeah, well,
I've been called worse.

39:13.850 --> 39:15.140
I'd also settle for "Detective."

39:15.140 --> 39:18.010
My child is not calling you
"Detective."

39:18.010 --> 39:20.390
Well, "Uncle Detective," then.
