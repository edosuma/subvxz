For everyone.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.540
But especially you.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.376
Where is this place?

13:29.409 --> 13:31.311
I'm not sure.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.645
My queen brought me here,

13:32.679 --> 13:35.648
she of the frosted
breakfast flakes.

We're gonna have a baby.

What is that?

13:41.922 --> 13:44.657
Peace. Love.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.194
He makes it. In here.

14:21.394 --> 14:25.398
It's prayers mixed with dreams.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.938
His spirit is the music

14:30.971 --> 14:33.340
and the word.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.342
What did it mean,
"Don't trust the mustache"?

14:35.375 --> 14:36.709
And who's the basket?

14:36.743 --> 14:38.045
And what are the forces
of multiplication?

14:38.078 --> 14:41.548
Soon.
He'll tell you everything.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.051
But you're not ready yet.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.220
Your mind has to open...

15:07.507 --> 15:09.509
"Time"?

(inhales)

15:20.954 --> 15:25.325
(vocalizing softly)

15:25.358 --> 15:27.995
That's Squirrel.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.663
He's the alchemist.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.103
Greetings, earthlings.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.771
Like your vibe.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.941
Very two days from now.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.978
Jia-yi.

15:46.013 --> 15:49.082
No. That's not it.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.084
* It's so very lonely... *

15:51.118 --> 15:55.288
We shall call you...

15:55.322 --> 15:57.290
Switch.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.958
And Switch

15:58.992 --> 16:02.329
shall be your name.

16:02.362 --> 16:07.167
* Bell flight 14,
you now can land *

16:09.736 --> 16:14.741
* Seen you on Aldebaran *

16:17.744 --> 16:22.915
* Safe
on the green desert sand *

16:25.918 --> 16:29.122
* It's so very lonely *

16:29.156 --> 16:31.124
* You're 2,000... *

16:31.158 --> 16:33.126
Are you really a virgin?

16:33.160 --> 16:36.129
Penis-free, 25 years.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.398
This is where you wait.

16:38.431 --> 16:39.832
She'll be here soon.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.234
She?

16:41.268 --> 16:43.236
"S" before "H."

16:43.270 --> 16:45.305
My beloved,

16:45.338 --> 16:47.307
the master of disaster.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.342
(clock ticking)

16:56.749 --> 16:58.751
(door closes)

17:29.249 --> 17:30.550
(clock ticking)

17:30.583 --> 17:33.553
-Her majesty.
-The breakfast queen.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.625
Sorry for the wait.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.293
Was it awful?

17:40.327 --> 17:42.629
Not too bad.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.334
(taps scepter)

18:00.413 --> 18:02.415
(clears throat)

18:03.816 --> 18:05.585
So...

18:05.618 --> 18:07.387
sad runaway

18:07.420 --> 18:09.556
or spoiled daddy's girl?

18:09.589 --> 18:10.823
Is this a cult?

18:10.857 --> 18:12.292
Yes.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.031
Are you the leader?

18:22.702 --> 18:24.671
I'm Lenny.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.673
And you are?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.509
Switch.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.077
Switch-hitter.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.645
Do you swing?

18:32.679 --> 18:34.581
I like boys.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.450
(scoffs) Why?

18:37.484 --> 18:40.019
Okay. (groans)

18:40.052 --> 18:41.754
Never mind.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.089
(drumming on couch)

18:43.122 --> 18:44.957
What do you want, Switcheroo?

18:44.991 --> 18:46.959
A Band-Aid for your boo-boo?

18:47.994 --> 18:50.129
I'm not looking for you.

18:50.163 --> 18:53.099
You're looking for me.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.702
"Are you a time traveler?

18:55.735 --> 18:58.738
The forces of multiplication
need you."

19:08.147 --> 19:10.116
Prove it.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.651
Not to you.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.686
To him.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.965
(birds chirping)

19:25.998 --> 19:28.000
(stream flowing)

19:39.279 --> 19:41.248
(door opens)

19:44.284 --> 19:46.253
Hi.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.255
I'm David.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.257
Come on in.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.858
I'll make some tea.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.332
What is this place?

19:59.366 --> 20:01.534
People have their pain.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.504
Their hearts are sad.
Their minds are tired.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.506
I help them.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.541
How?

20:08.575 --> 20:10.443
I'm the magic man.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.247
All I ask

20:14.281 --> 20:17.049
is that they stay
and keep me company after.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.053
Take care of the house.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.526
Love each other.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.928
I need that.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.497
Love.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.870
How is this here?

20:37.904 --> 20:40.740
This... cave?

20:40.773 --> 20:42.509
I made it.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.146
Try this.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.148
Close your eyes.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.252
Close your eyes.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.723
And picture your bedroom.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.925
Your bed.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.960
Can you see it?

21:02.529 --> 21:04.230
Really see it?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.733
The walls, the windows?

21:06.766 --> 21:09.502
The way the light falls?

21:10.537 --> 21:12.339
Open your eyes.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.184
It's a mental space.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.987
You imagined it. I made it real.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.124
You read my mind?

21:32.158 --> 21:34.694
No secrets.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.397
That's one of our rules.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.999
What about trust?

21:40.032 --> 21:42.369
Mm. I tried that,

21:42.402 --> 21:45.705
and it's better
to read people's minds.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.543
I'm adopted.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.945
When I was a baby,

21:52.979 --> 21:54.647
a monster snuck into my head

21:54.681 --> 21:58.518
and haunted me for 33 years.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.920
(monster snarling)

22:02.989 --> 22:04.957
But I'm better now.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.959
How are you?

22:06.993 --> 22:10.262
Good. I'm good.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.101
How are you?

22:16.168 --> 22:19.238
You know. Fine.

22:27.246 --> 22:30.049
How are you?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.895
My dad collects robots.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.898
Robotto.

22:45.932 --> 22:48.100
There's a room in our apartment.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.101
(faint whirring)

22:49.135 --> 22:51.103
Some are life-sized.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.039
Some toys.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.974
Hundreds.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.344
Sometimes at night,
I go in there.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.379
(whirring, ticking)

23:01.814 --> 23:05.051
I stand very still,

23:05.084 --> 23:08.287
and pretend I'm a robot, too.

23:18.565 --> 23:22.134
So what are
"the forces of division"?

23:22.168 --> 23:24.804
Why do you need a time traveler?

23:27.173 --> 23:29.175
(glass thuds)

23:36.148 --> 23:38.551
So it's a girl thing.

23:38.585 --> 23:42.555
You want to go back in time
and... what?

23:42.589 --> 23:45.424
Get your girlfriend back?

23:45.458 --> 23:48.060
I thought about it.

23:48.094 --> 23:52.665
Doing everything again, making
different choices, but...

23:52.699 --> 23:54.100
(clicks tongue)

23:54.133 --> 23:56.402
...it won't work.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.405
You know how sometimes you can
be so sure what the problem is

23:59.438 --> 24:02.475
and then you realize the problem
is really something else?

24:02.509 --> 24:03.910
No.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.480
Oh. Well, you're young.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.916
When I was in the psych ward,

24:09.949 --> 24:12.318
everybody was so sure
the problem was neurological.

24:12.351 --> 24:13.986
Brain chemistry, serotonin.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.421
"David Haller, schizophrenic."

24:15.454 --> 24:17.790
You were in
a psychiatric hospital?

24:17.824 --> 24:21.427
(chuckles):
Oh. Oh. Lots of times.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.196
Psych hospitals,
emergency rooms.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.667
"David, don't swallow all
your mother's diet pills."

24:27.700 --> 24:30.002
"David, don't huff the chemicals
under the sink."

24:30.036 --> 24:31.638
Like I'm supposed to-- what?

24:31.671 --> 24:34.641
Pretend the voices
aren't real? You know?

24:34.674 --> 24:37.143
-Yeah, sure.
-You see, like I said,

24:37.176 --> 24:38.978
when I was a baby,
a monster came into my head

24:39.011 --> 24:42.014
and haunted me
for, like, 33 years.

24:42.048 --> 24:47.086
By "monster," you mean,
like, a metaphor, right?

24:49.155 --> 24:52.424
Amahl Farouk. The Shadow King.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.862
My dad, my real dad,

24:55.895 --> 24:59.198
he kicked Farouk out of his body
into the astral plane.

24:59.231 --> 25:02.635
And then he found me-- Farouk--

25:02.669 --> 25:05.504
and he moved in.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.842
More tea?

25:12.511 --> 25:13.713
(squeaks)

25:40.206 --> 25:42.208
(birds chirping)

26:06.733 --> 26:08.735
*

26:20.412 --> 26:22.649
(shouts)

26:38.130 --> 26:40.466
I still don't know why
you need a time traveler.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.134
To go back in time.

26:42.168 --> 26:44.003
What else?

26:44.036 --> 26:47.273
-How far?
-Well, how far can you go?

26:49.341 --> 26:51.343
(whirring)

26:55.815 --> 26:58.184
(David grunts)

27:20.239 --> 27:21.908
*

27:30.149 --> 27:31.217
(muffled gasping)

27:49.168 --> 27:51.170
-*
-(soldiers screaming)

27:55.775 --> 27:57.777
(gunshot)

28:09.889 --> 28:12.091
(racks shotgun, casing clatters)

28:12.124 --> 28:14.560
Stay down, kid.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.117
(voice over headphones
speaking Mandarin)

29:20.359 --> 29:22.361
(clock ticking)

29:52.391 --> 29:54.493
(clock ticking)

29:54.526 --> 29:55.962
(door opens)

29:57.897 --> 30:00.732
-Her majesty...
-The breakfast queen.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.903
(indistinct chatter)

30:07.974 --> 30:10.176
Prove it.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.678
To him.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.359
I'm David.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.128
Come on in.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.930
I'll make some tea.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.637
DAVID:
Yes, it pays to be kind.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.073
DAVID 2 (Scottish accent):
Are you out of your mind?

30:41.107 --> 30:43.075
"Is black tea okay?" What are
you gonna do with this one?

30:43.109 --> 30:44.510
Give her a wee nib
of the blue stuff

30:44.543 --> 30:45.711
and sling her in
with all the others?

30:47.613 --> 30:50.716
Shall we sit out here?

30:50.749 --> 30:54.686
I'm excited to talk to you,
hear what brought you to us.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.655
We don't have time for that.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.090
(shouts)

30:59.558 --> 31:01.227
Lenny says you grew up
in the city.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.861
They're coming.

31:02.895 --> 31:05.464
The forces of division.
They're almost here.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.567
I've seen them.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.702
They kill you.

31:11.737 --> 31:15.207
No. I'd hear them.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.610
You didn't last time.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.113
What do you mean, "last time"?

31:21.147 --> 31:23.249
"Time traveler wanted."

31:23.282 --> 31:26.285
-You wrote that.
-(echoing scream)

31:26.318 --> 31:29.588
"Find the pregnant virgin."

31:29.621 --> 31:32.091
Well, I did. I'm here.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.260
And we got to go...

31:34.293 --> 31:36.295
(gunfire)

31:38.164 --> 31:39.431
(Lenny laughs maniacally)

31:40.666 --> 31:42.668
*

31:46.605 --> 31:48.607
Oh, David!

31:50.809 --> 31:52.811
*

32:19.038 --> 32:20.506
(grunts)

32:28.114 --> 32:30.116
Stick with me.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.920
(grunts)

32:34.953 --> 32:36.355
Come on.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.497
David!

32:47.399 --> 32:49.401
(pig snorting)

32:53.672 --> 32:55.374
This way!

32:55.407 --> 32:57.409
(pig snorting)

32:58.644 --> 33:00.646
(gunshot)

33:06.918 --> 33:08.654
(casing clatters)

33:14.993 --> 33:16.562
(shouting)

33:16.595 --> 33:18.597
(panting)

33:30.276 --> 33:32.278
(clock ticking)

33:38.250 --> 33:40.686
(muffled, distant laughter)

33:45.524 --> 33:48.127
(clock continues ticking)

34:01.640 --> 34:03.642
(humming fades)

34:07.913 --> 34:09.715
FAROUK:
You're cheating.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.750
(footsteps approaching)

34:23.562 --> 34:25.731
A time traveler.

34:25.764 --> 34:28.234
C'est magnifique.

34:28.267 --> 34:31.703
I had relations
with a time traveler once.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.905
Geraldine.

34:34.940 --> 34:38.610
Is it true
that you are always women?

34:38.644 --> 34:41.213
Pourquoi?

34:41.247 --> 34:44.883
Maybe it has something
to do with regret.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.719
Choices made and not made.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.622
Opportunities missed.

34:50.656 --> 34:53.159
I'm not supposed to be here.

34:53.192 --> 34:57.062
Wherever this is.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.431
This is...

34:59.465 --> 35:01.133
the astral plane.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.669
A world beyond the world.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.937
Made of pure energy.

35:05.971 --> 35:09.308
Very few can see it.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.677
David, for example.

35:14.012 --> 35:15.814
Oh, you know him.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.683
David Haller.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.156
He used to be easy to find.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.593
His power was so loud

35:27.626 --> 35:29.961
and no control.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.097
But now...

35:32.130 --> 35:34.132
(birds singing)

35:39.037 --> 35:41.106
Is this a...

35:41.139 --> 35:42.541
mental space?

35:42.574 --> 35:45.411
-(liquid pouring)
-Did you make this?

35:49.548 --> 35:51.817
I was looking for David...

35:51.850 --> 35:54.520
and saw you.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.888
Your... trail.

35:58.424 --> 35:59.825
See?

35:59.858 --> 36:02.861
The realms of time and space...

36:02.894 --> 36:05.831
collide here in the plane.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.833
Now...

36:07.866 --> 36:10.168
the first time I see you,

36:10.202 --> 36:12.671
I think, "Interesting."

36:12.704 --> 36:14.606
But the second time...

36:16.608 --> 36:19.177
You're helping him, no?

36:21.179 --> 36:24.516
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.518
We, too, want to help him.

36:26.552 --> 36:29.855
He's a very sick young man.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.090
Then why did she shoot him?

36:32.123 --> 36:33.959
The blonde?

36:37.963 --> 36:39.931
You have seen this?

36:42.601 --> 36:44.670
So we find him...

36:44.703 --> 36:47.706
and you go back
to change what happens.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.443
-I have to go.
-To warn him.

36:51.477 --> 36:54.746
What does he have that you need?

36:56.114 --> 36:58.784
Maybe we can make
a different arrangement.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.720
Tell me.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.755
Why are you helping him?

37:05.291 --> 37:07.293
(speaking Mandarin)

37:22.808 --> 37:24.643
(exhales)

37:24.676 --> 37:26.412
(chuckles softly)

37:26.445 --> 37:28.814
Ah...

37:28.847 --> 37:31.450
(exhales)

37:31.483 --> 37:33.319
(inhales deeply)

37:33.352 --> 37:36.087
(exhales slowly)

37:57.042 --> 38:00.145
MAINFRAME (over PA):
Time to symbiosis T-minus 45.

38:00.178 --> 38:03.214
-I'm hungry.
-Not now.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.785
That's right, I forgot
you're making a person

38:06.818 --> 38:09.488
It's not a person.
It's a fully synthetic

38:09.521 --> 38:11.256
bipedal quantum computer.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.791
Yeah, but it looks a lot
like somebody we know.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.160
VERMILLION 1:
Initiating cranial fusion.

38:15.193 --> 38:16.795
MAINFRAME:
Time to symbiosis...

38:16.828 --> 38:18.564
-(exhales)
-...T-minus 30.

38:29.207 --> 38:30.676
(whirring)

38:30.709 --> 38:32.277
Why does he have a mustache?

38:32.310 --> 38:33.845
I don't know, I...

38:33.879 --> 38:36.114
MAINFRAME:
Time to symbiosis, T-minus 15.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.716
Calibrating synchronicity.

38:37.749 --> 38:40.352
Beginning data transfer.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.656
MAINFRAME:
Sentience in ten...

38:44.690 --> 38:47.292
-(whirs)
-nine...

38:47.325 --> 38:49.294
eight...

38:49.327 --> 38:50.996
seven...

38:51.029 --> 38:53.365
-six...
-Wonder if he'll
still be grouchy.

38:53.399 --> 38:54.966
-Shh.
-...five...

38:55.000 --> 38:57.035
four...

38:57.068 --> 38:58.837
three...

38:58.870 --> 39:00.572
-two...
-(Kerry sighs)

39:00.606 --> 39:02.007
-One.
-KERRY: Whoa.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.242
It's, it's, it's all right.

39:04.275 --> 39:05.644
MAINFRAME:
Symbiosis complete.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.546
The mainframe
is now ambulatory.

39:14.285 --> 39:17.088
How do you feel?

39:17.122 --> 39:19.558
Running diagnostics.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.160
Faulty HVAC unit
in the Oslo facility.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.995
Data slowdown
in the Minsk network.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.664
There are currently
nine faulty satellites

39:25.697 --> 39:27.533
-in the atmospheric array.
-I meant you.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.267
How do you feel?

39:29.300 --> 39:33.071
You, the entity
known as Ptonomy?

39:33.104 --> 39:35.373
There is no Ptonomy,
there is only the mainframe.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.377
Why do I have a mustache?

39:39.411 --> 39:41.246
Oh, they have mustaches,
I just thought...

39:41.279 --> 39:43.281
Routing all command functions
to this vessel.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.250
Can we eat now?

39:45.283 --> 39:48.554
In a moment.
I have to test his reflexes.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.390
Slow.

39:52.424 --> 39:54.993
Oh...

40:05.837 --> 40:08.206
Not sure how much more money
we can throw at this.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.376
You know,
there are other threats.

40:11.409 --> 40:15.080
He destroys the world.
I said that, right?

40:15.113 --> 40:17.382
DANIEL:
It's not... me.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.551
I've got bosses
and they've got bosses.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.820
CLARK:
Well, I thought I was your boss.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.288
DANIEL:
Only at home.

40:23.321 --> 40:25.223
He has a time traveler.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.225
Who?

40:27.258 --> 40:29.160
David.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.597
I met her in the astral plane.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.499
Uh, what do you mean,
he has a time traveler?

40:33.532 --> 40:37.335
She's young, a teenager.

40:37.368 --> 40:39.270
She has skill.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.339
CLARK:
(stammers) She's with David?
How do you know?

40:41.372 --> 40:43.642
We spoke.

40:45.143 --> 40:48.614
So you had her...
and then you let her go?

40:49.648 --> 40:52.417
Like I said, she has skill.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.085
You see,

40:54.119 --> 40:57.255
the astral plane exists
at the crux

40:57.288 --> 40:59.357
of time and space.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.993
It's, uh,
how do you say, um...

41:02.027 --> 41:03.762
a rest stop.

41:03.795 --> 41:07.032
I was able to intercept her,
but only...

41:07.065 --> 41:09.434
for a moment.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.503
So where is he?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.340
Our boy shields
his mind from me.

41:15.373 --> 41:17.208
And how does she help him?

41:17.242 --> 41:19.511
This time traveler?

41:19.545 --> 41:21.513
To answer, I must ask...

41:21.547 --> 41:24.215
how do you surprise someone

41:24.249 --> 41:27.152
who can go back in time
and warn himself?

41:34.192 --> 41:36.995
Why don't we have
a time traveler?

41:37.028 --> 41:38.797
(dial-up screech)

41:38.830 --> 41:40.832
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
David Haller location detected.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.802
That's industrial, low density.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.638
I say we scramble the jet
and we drop a bomb.

41:46.672 --> 41:49.507
No, no, it should be a team.

41:49.541 --> 41:52.578
We've got to make sure.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.780
You've trained for this.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.687
And the time traveler?

42:01.720 --> 42:04.089
Remember: whatever we do...

42:04.122 --> 42:06.257
she can undo.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.359
Great. Then we kill her, too.

42:10.796 --> 42:12.363
(chuckles softly)

42:18.970 --> 42:20.972
(classical music playing)

42:46.632 --> 42:48.299
FAROUK:
We have him.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.308
I'll get ready.

42:57.342 --> 42:58.744
How big is the team?

42:58.777 --> 43:00.779
You don't have to go.

43:01.813 --> 43:03.915
I'm going.

43:03.949 --> 43:05.984
Why not stay back?

43:06.017 --> 43:08.586
Let us take care of things.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.925
He's not my first boyfriend.

43:13.959 --> 43:16.494
He's not even the first boy
to take advantage.

43:16.527 --> 43:18.496
There's a job to do.

43:19.530 --> 43:21.933
Revenge is not a job.

43:21.967 --> 43:24.002
It's not that.

43:27.172 --> 43:30.742
All that love,
it doesn't just disappear.

43:30.776 --> 43:34.079
It must be transformed
into an emotion

43:34.112 --> 43:36.114
of equal intensity.

43:36.147 --> 43:39.050
That is the law of the universe.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.320
Pretty sure
you're making that up.

43:42.353 --> 43:44.322
(chuckles)
My dear,

43:44.355 --> 43:47.492
I am over 2,000 years old.

43:47.525 --> 43:49.327
I don't make things up.

43:49.360 --> 43:50.929
I have wisdom.

43:50.962 --> 43:54.432
And my wisdom says
you remain here

43:54.465 --> 43:57.368
and we will kill him.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.338
No.

44:00.371 --> 44:02.808
I have to be there.

44:02.841 --> 44:05.877
*

44:10.982 --> 44:12.984
This should block
your brain waves.

44:14.585 --> 44:17.455
I've built similar tech into
our fighting friends' helmets.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.925
This way,
David won't hear us coming.

44:22.027 --> 44:24.029
*

44:29.667 --> 44:32.037
The David Haller phenomenon
is contained

44:32.070 --> 44:34.472
within normal space and time.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.208
Outward signs indicate
he is unaware of our approach.

44:37.242 --> 44:38.977
Probability of success?

44:39.010 --> 44:41.046
67%.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.053
Air support?

44:48.086 --> 44:50.388
At the weigh station,
ready to move in.

44:50.421 --> 44:52.090
*

45:04.402 --> 45:06.304
Spread out.

45:11.409 --> 45:13.711
(sniffs)

45:17.715 --> 45:19.517
Clark.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.920
I see him.

45:21.953 --> 45:23.989
Get the hook.

45:26.257 --> 45:29.227
Get ready to move.

45:29.260 --> 45:31.296
Send in air support.

45:31.329 --> 45:33.231
We go in ten,

45:33.264 --> 45:35.633
nine,

45:35.666 --> 45:37.702
eight, seven,

45:37.735 --> 45:39.370
six,

45:39.404 --> 45:40.972
five...

45:41.006 --> 45:42.974
-(shouts)
-...four...

45:43.775 --> 45:45.110
(static)

45:45.143 --> 45:47.445
MAINFRAME:
Ground connection lost.

45:47.478 --> 45:49.480
Ground connection...

45:57.823 --> 46:00.258
(footsteps approaching)

46:09.267 --> 46:11.669
What's up?

46:23.849 --> 46:28.653
* Time keeps on slippin',
slippin', slippin' *

46:28.686 --> 46:31.722
* Into the future *

46:36.461 --> 46:40.798
* Time keeps on slippin',
slippin', slippin' *

46:40.832 --> 46:43.869
* Into the future *

46:43.902 --> 46:47.973
* The future, the future *

46:48.006 --> 46:52.543
* I want to fly like an eagle *

46:52.577 --> 46:55.881
* To the sea *

46:55.914 --> 46:58.283
* Fly like an eagle *

46:58.316 --> 47:00.718
* Let my spirit carry me *

47:00.751 --> 47:04.990
* I want to fly like an eagle *

47:05.023 --> 47:07.993
* Till I'm free *

47:08.026 --> 47:09.560
* Oh, Lord *

47:09.594 --> 47:13.231
* Through the revolution *

47:13.264 --> 47:16.868
-* Feed the babies *
-* Feed the babies *

47:16.902 --> 47:19.704
* Who don't have enough to eat *

47:19.737 --> 47:23.341
-* Shoe the children *
-* Shoe the children *

47:23.374 --> 47:25.977
* With no shoes on their feet *

47:26.011 --> 47:29.881
-* House the people *
-* House the people *

47:29.915 --> 47:32.717
* Livin' in the street *

47:32.750 --> 47:34.986
* Said, oh, look *

47:35.020 --> 47:38.723
* There's a solution *

47:38.756 --> 47:42.994
* I want to fly like an eagle *

47:43.028 --> 47:45.830
* To the sea *

47:45.863 --> 47:48.166
* Fly like an eagle *

47:48.199 --> 47:51.002
* Let my spirit carry me *

47:51.036 --> 47:55.840
-* I want to fly like an eagle *
-* Fly *

47:55.873 --> 47:58.343
* Till I'm free *

47:58.376 --> 48:04.582
* Fly through the revolution. *

49:00.438 --> 49:01.872
MAN:
Now I get it.
