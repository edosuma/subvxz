04:24.960 --> 04:28.479
It's a little bit of
jeopardy I think kind of...

04:28.480 --> 04:30.199
- Oh, here we go, here we go.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.281

04:31.282 --> 04:35.410
on the edge by getting to
a ferry a little bit late.

Is that near enough?

05:13.885 --> 05:14.885
- Yes.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.764
- You're right about
this being a better way.

05:17.765 --> 05:19.679
This is more romantic.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.364
This is more like a journey.

05:21.365 --> 05:22.999
- It is.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.645
And you know what the most famous boat

05:24.646 --> 05:27.246

famous ship, I should say?

05:32.160 --> 05:33.599

05:33.600 --> 05:35.090

05:35.091 --> 05:37.919
they tied themselves to that crane,

05:37.920 --> 05:40.839
demanded more breadfruit
for their children.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.807
- Where were they headed.

05:41.808 --> 05:43.365
- They were headed to America.

05:43.366 --> 05:45.119

06:39.086 --> 06:40.605
- Yeah, well, it's the
gentle rocking motion.

06:40.606 --> 06:43.524
I think you either have
sea legs or you don't.

06:43.525 --> 06:47.605
- Santander, the largest city
in Cantabria by some margin,

06:49.240 --> 06:50.839
population 200,000.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.119
An elegant, stylish resort

07:26.488 --> 07:29.285
- I said it's charming, charming
that his mother made it.

07:29.286 --> 07:30.403
You know, up at Leo's.

07:30.404 --> 07:31.959
- What's happening in New York?

07:31.960 --> 07:32.802
- I've been seeing a lot of Mischa.

07:32.803 --> 07:34.559
You remember Mischa?

07:34.560 --> 07:36.164
- The girl you were seeing
when we were in Italy?

07:36.165 --> 07:37.366
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.002
- You're seein' her again?

07:40.003 --> 07:43.125
- Didn't she get, she got...
- I, I'm in love with her.

07:43.126 --> 07:44.849
- Thought she got married.

07:44.850 --> 07:46.959
- She is married.

07:46.960 --> 07:47.999
- Oh.

07:48.000 --> 07:48.965
- Um, I know, it's not right,

07:48.966 --> 07:50.244
- because it's not ideal.
- Carry on, take your time.

07:50.245 --> 07:51.127
Give me details.

07:51.128 --> 07:53.566
- It's not ideal, but we
just bumped into each other

07:53.567 --> 07:56.759
and, uh, and you know, we just,

07:56.760 --> 07:58.724
you could tell it was just there.

07:58.725 --> 08:01.121
I smiled, I gave her one
of my smiles, and, uh...

08:01.122 --> 08:03.771
- Well, I mean, you don't
have to say any more.

08:03.772 --> 08:06.199
One of those smiles.

08:06.200 --> 08:11.079
- Then like an anchovy, she
just wiggled into my net again.

08:11.080 --> 08:11.920
- Is it exciting?

08:11.921 --> 08:13.522
- It is exciting, but it's
not like the first time.

08:13.523 --> 08:14.679
It's not like I don't know her.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.001
It's like we've rekindled what
we had before and it's so...

08:17.002 --> 08:18.123
- It's still exciting.

08:18.124 --> 08:19.605
- Oh, yeah, it is.

08:19.606 --> 08:22.519
- Us, you lose excitement
when you're married.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.360
I'll tell you that.

08:23.361 --> 08:24.325
- Yeah, well, you can't have everything.

08:24.326 --> 08:25.604
The thing is you can't have everything.

08:25.605 --> 08:26.567
- You can't have everything.
- You can't have everything.

08:26.568 --> 08:28.599
- That's my mantra, you
can't have everything.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.442
- Yeah.
- When people complain

08:29.443 --> 08:31.399
no, yeah, make a choice.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.528
- Very, I, I couldn't agree
more, couldn't agree more.

08:33.529 --> 08:35.519
- I have a young family.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.245
For a man of my age, my kids are young.

08:37.246 --> 08:38.799
- Yeah, how old's your wife?

08:38.799 --> 08:39.799
- 43.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.320
- Mm-hmm.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.721
You just got those kids in,
just squeezed 'em in quick then?

08:43.722 --> 08:44.919
- Yeah, yeah.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.649
I'm not going the full Mick
Jagger and having them at,

08:46.650 --> 08:48.642
he's having another one at 72.

08:48.643 --> 08:50.559
- Ah, that's tough then.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.919
- Ever met him?

08:51.920 --> 08:52.762
- I have.

08:52.763 --> 08:54.439
- I was at a party.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.126
I was leaving, and I
heard from the balcony,

08:59.160 --> 09:00.359
"Rob, Rob."

09:00.360 --> 09:02.408
- Rob, hey, uh, Rob, Rob.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.885
- Only, well, he didn't do the full,

09:04.886 --> 09:07.039
and I looked up, and he went,

09:07.040 --> 09:09.559
"Don't throw those bloody spears at me."

09:09.560 --> 09:10.559
I said, what?

09:10.560 --> 09:12.767
He goes, "Don't throw
those bloody spears at me."

09:12.768 --> 09:14.359
- Yeah, uh, no, no.

09:14.360 --> 09:15.245
- He was doing Michael Caine.

09:15.246 --> 09:16.571
- I know, I know, but what you find

09:16.572 --> 09:18.365
is that he speaks like, sometimes he,

09:18.366 --> 09:21.165
so it's sorta like that
it's actually quite posh.

09:21.166 --> 09:24.205
And sometimes he's quite,
such that you can say

09:24.206 --> 09:27.601
that he's quite actually
sort of public school thing

09:27.602 --> 09:30.251
going on, you know, and then
he goes sorta deep like that.

09:30.252 --> 09:32.959
But, um, but uh, and uh.

09:32.960 --> 09:37.279
You know, you got that whole
sort of, um, the peacock thing.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.639
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.844
- He went, "Don't throw
those bloody spears at me."

09:41.845 --> 09:43.682
And I went, oh, you're Michael Caine.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.485
So I looked up at him and I said,

09:45.486 --> 09:47.801
I've told you before, if
you're not gonna sing,

09:47.802 --> 09:50.451
I don't wanna bloody know, now
get back in the other room.

09:50.452 --> 09:55.319
And he want ah-ah-ah-ah, and
off he went, he loved it.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.285
But had I had
- How'd it, uh...

09:56.286 --> 09:57.406
- close conversation with
him, I would have said,

09:57.407 --> 10:00.199
what are you doing having a child at 72?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.601
- No, you know what, I
mean, it's not ideal,

10:02.602 --> 10:05.279
but Charlie Chaplin was
knockin' 'em out in his 80s,

10:05.280 --> 10:06.361
and that's not ideal either,

10:06.362 --> 10:10.081
but we're positively
footloose and care-free.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.605
We're like teenagers
compared to those guys.

10:12.606 --> 10:13.679
- Yeah, yeah.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.727
- We should enjoy this moment.

10:14.728 --> 10:16.399
We're at the sweet spot in our lives.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.240
- Mm-mm-mm-mm.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.127
- We really are.

10:18.128 --> 10:21.039
We're like ripe, you know.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.879
I am in my prime.

10:22.880 --> 10:23.722
That was Miss Jean,

10:23.723 --> 10:25.562
I should play Miss Jean Brodie.

10:25.563 --> 10:27.369
There's a lot of gender-swapping going on

10:27.370 --> 10:28.959
now in big roles.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.644
I could play Miss Jean Brodie.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.520
<i>- HEY-</i>

10:42.201 --> 10:43.201
- Oh.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.248
- Thank you.
- Muchas gracias.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.406
- You writing anything at the moment.

10:53.407 --> 10:54.481
- Of course I am, yeah.

10:54.482 --> 10:57.685
What I'm trying to do with
this odyssey through Spain

10:57.686 --> 10:59.159
is do what Laurie Lee did.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.207
See you don't know this about me.

11:00.208 --> 11:02.441
About 30 years ago, when I was 18,

11:02.442 --> 11:04.639
I came to Spain, backpacking,

11:04.640 --> 11:07.166
after A-levels, before
I want to university,

11:07.167 --> 11:10.642
and I met a woman called Sofia who was 37.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.562
She basically showed me the ropes.

11:13.563 --> 11:14.799
I lost my virginity to her.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.006
- How many years ago?

11:16.007 --> 11:18.799
- Well, it's 32 years ago.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.290
- So she's now 70?

11:21.400 --> 11:23.242
- Yeah, yeah, she's 70, yeah.

11:23.243 --> 11:24.446
- Should we look her up?

11:24.447 --> 11:26.119
- No, I saw, I met her.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.239
She's massive.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.401
- Saw her on a Vespa.
- Successful?

11:28.402 --> 11:29.890
No, no, I mean fat.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.999
- I think, the two of you
should give it another go.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.047
- Yeah, but you're just being
- Why don't you just take her

11:35.048 --> 11:37.559
- facetious, come on.
- Some Turkish delight.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.085
- I think that's the last
thing she wants the most.

11:39.086 --> 11:41.321
It's the one thing I do know about her.

11:41.322 --> 11:45.919
Anyway, I want to write a
book about Spain and me.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.762
- Is that why you bought
the Laurie Lee book?

11:47.763 --> 11:49.841
- Yeah, well, he wrote
this when he was early 50s,

11:49.842 --> 11:51.239
but it's about when he was 18,

11:51.240 --> 11:52.685
so it's almost exactly the same as me.

11:52.686 --> 11:56.119
- Cervantes wrote Don
Quixote when he was 50.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.799
50's in many ways, I think...

11:57.800 --> 11:59.039
- No, we're at the
sweet spot in our life.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.439
- The best age, it's the sweet spot.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.879
You've still got, touch wood, time.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.206
- We're ripe, we're ripe fruit.

12:06.207 --> 12:08.005
If you hang onto the branch any longer,

12:08.006 --> 12:09.599
you're just gonna wither on the vine,

12:09.600 --> 12:10.839
- and I won't do that.
- So what do you do then?

12:10.840 --> 12:11.879
- Drop-

12:11.880 --> 12:13.365
- Or do you wanna be plucked?

12:13.366 --> 12:15.399
- You wanna be plucked, actually.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.241
- I'd like much rather to
be plucked than dropped.

12:17.242 --> 12:18.239
- Oh, I just caught myself.
- Who's gonna want you

12:18.240 --> 12:19.240
at this age?

12:20.200 --> 12:21.929
- You'd be surprised.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.241
After Philomena, this opened
a whole new sort of chapter

12:31.242 --> 12:33.799
for me in terms of like
the way my career has gone.

12:33.800 --> 12:34.642
All the, uh-

12:34.643 --> 12:35.923
- Co-wrote that, didn't you?

12:35.924 --> 12:38.486
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I always co-write.

12:38.487 --> 12:41.642
Really I'm kinda
like, I'm the one who talks

12:41.643 --> 12:43.642
and has all the ideas,
and the other person's

12:43.643 --> 12:45.719
kinda like a, sort of, typist.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.365
- Would they view it that way?

12:47.366 --> 12:49.647
- Oh, no, I would never say
that to them personally.

12:49.648 --> 12:51.759
But I mean, but privately.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.599
- These reviews I write myself of course.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.565
- That's great.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.400
I mean, how are you gonna do it?

12:56.401 --> 12:57.242
- We're in Spain.

12:57.243 --> 13:00.679
I'm gonna do it like Sancho
Panza and Don Quixote.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.725
Two middle-aged men, who
were looking for adventure.

13:03.726 --> 13:04.926
- That's not about...

13:04.927 --> 13:07.651
- Don Quixote, idealist, dreamer,

13:08.760 --> 13:10.999
- head in the clouds, yes.
- Yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.241
- And his solid, dependable friend.

13:13.242 --> 13:15.199
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.839
- So what are you co-writing?

13:22.840 --> 13:23.887
- It's called Missing.

13:23.888 --> 13:27.719
It's about a man looking for his daughter.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.285
- This'll be the follow-up to your film

13:29.286 --> 13:31.362
about a woman looking for her son.

13:31.363 --> 13:36.039
- Yeah, well, exactly, it's
the sister piece to that.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.724
And if I do another one,
then it'll be a trilogy.

13:37.725 --> 13:40.366
But, anyway, yeah, it's
about the two of them...

13:40.367 --> 13:42.324
- He should be looking for something else?

13:42.325 --> 13:44.561
You know to avoid the comparisons.

13:44.562 --> 13:47.479
Maybe man looking for his car.

13:47.480 --> 13:51.479
- The thing is you can do
man whose lost his car.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.999
European filmmakers use huge, overbearing,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.081
use thematic metaphors all the time,

13:57.082 --> 13:58.762
so it could be a guy looking for his car,

13:58.763 --> 14:00.599
but actually he doesn't realize.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.839
He thinks he's looking for his car,

14:01.840 --> 14:03.046
but actually he's looking for something

14:03.047 --> 14:04.559
much bigger than that.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.560
- A van.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.079
- Yeah, but the van of life.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.239
The van of life.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.519
- Well?

14:12.520 --> 14:15.569
- Can we put this up?
- Can we close it?

14:18.920 --> 14:21.719
- Come inside, come inside.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.449
Are we going?

14:25.120 --> 14:26.120
<i>Ream?</i>

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
Thank you.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.161
Have you ever seen rain like this?

14:39.162 --> 14:41.288
- Oh, yeah, I was in on a,

14:42.600 --> 14:44.887
I got stuck in a landslide overnight

14:44.888 --> 14:47.360
on the west side of Thirlmere.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.444
Stuck in a landslide,
had to stay overnight

14:50.445 --> 14:52.568
- in the car for 18 hours.
- Hmm, hmm.

14:52.569 --> 14:57.279
- I found out later I was in
the wettest spot in the country

14:57.280 --> 15:00.011
- ever recorded in history.
- You've told me this before.

15:00.012 --> 15:01.999
Told me this before.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.923
- Um, you, you
asked, and that was...

15:03.924 --> 15:06.919
- No, I asked you have you ever seen

15:06.920 --> 15:07.959
anything like this?

15:07.960 --> 15:09.323
- Obviously, if you
ask a question like that,

15:09.324 --> 15:10.160
you also want some details.

15:10.161 --> 15:11.762
- If it's a story
that you've told before,

15:11.763 --> 15:14.001
you say, yes, do you remember
that time in a landslide,

15:14.002 --> 15:16.039
and I say, Oh, I remember.

17:11.845 --> 17:14.922
- Oh, hey,
Steve, hey, yeah, um, look,

17:14.923 --> 17:17.124
I was just gonna call you, actually,

17:17.125 --> 17:20.089
to let you know that
Matt has left the agency.

17:20.090 --> 17:21.799
- Uh, what?

17:21.800 --> 17:24.040
- Yeah, he's gone to a management company.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.963
Look it all happened very quickly,

17:25.964 --> 17:30.279
and Lindeman wanted to check
it out before it was announced.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.964
It's gonna be in the trades today,

17:31.965 --> 17:35.359
so I will be taking over
all of Matt's clients

17:35.360 --> 17:36.879
who stay at the agency.

17:36.880 --> 17:37.720
Okay?

17:37.721 --> 17:39.324
And, Steve, I just, I want to let you know

17:39.325 --> 17:41.879
how excited I am about working

17:41.880 --> 17:44.360
with you and representing you.

18:09.440 --> 18:14.279
- That's the seat.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.770
Okay, you are in holiday?

18:15.771 --> 18:19.759
- No, no, I'm a writer.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.171
- Yeah, you're a writer?

18:29.480 --> 18:31.999
- And I had a movie at the Oscars.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.523
You know the Academy Awards?

18:33.524 --> 18:34.999
Yeah, one of my movies was, uh...

18:35.000 --> 18:35.808
- Okay.

18:35.809 --> 18:37.211
- So that was muy bien.

18:37.212 --> 18:38.326
- That's fine.

18:53.000 --> 18:53.842
- And the winner is

18:53.843 --> 18:56.959
- Steve McQueen.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.039
- I've won it!
- Sit down.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.371
Sit down, Steve.

New, you're still in New York,

19:25.563 --> 19:27.242
I hear very good things about the series.

19:27.243 --> 19:28.765
- No, I'm in Spain with Rob.

19:28.766 --> 19:30.319
That's okay.

19:30.320 --> 19:35.119
- Look, Greg, did you know that
Matt had left the US agency?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.686
- Yes, yes, I did, um,
yes I did know that.

19:37.687 --> 19:39.245
I was going to call you actually.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.965
- Did you know about this before I did?

19:40.966 --> 19:43.079
- No, no, not at all, no.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.208
- Right, and do you know
that his assistant, Jonathan,

19:45.209 --> 19:46.962
is taking over his client list?

19:46.963 --> 19:49.643
- Yes, yeah, you see, Jonathan,
I think, is very good.

19:49.644 --> 19:52.041
I think he's very bright, so, you know.

19:52.042 --> 19:55.010
- Uh, what's happening
with Matt's other clients?

19:55.011 --> 19:59.085
- Uh, well, I know that, uh,
Ricky's, Ricky's gone with him.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.329
And, um, Will Ferrell.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.364
- Did he ask Ricky to go with him?

20:05.365 --> 20:06.805
- Yes, yeah, he did.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.479
- He didn't ask me.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.162
- Yeah, well, you see, I think, I think

20:10.163 --> 20:12.766
you're seen more as a
writer, Steve, I mean,

20:12.767 --> 20:17.319
so you wouldn't need a manager
as well as an agent, so...

20:17.320 --> 20:20.721
- So which clients are staying
with the new assistant?

20:20.722 --> 20:22.768
- Uh, Kevin Klein, I can't really

20:22.769 --> 20:25.039
see him going anywhere else.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.159
Um...

20:26.160 --> 20:30.039
- Look, uh, Greg,
will you do me a favor please?

20:30.040 --> 20:34.319
Can you find out why
the script for Missing

20:34.320 --> 20:36.559
hasn't been green-lit yet?

20:36.560 --> 20:37.525
- That hasn't happened?

20:37.526 --> 20:38.679
I mean that absolutely,
I know, I know, well,

20:38.680 --> 20:39.520
that should have happened.

20:39.521 --> 20:41.600
I'll get onto that, I'll
get onto that straightaway.

20:41.601 --> 20:42.440
But, yeah...

20:42.441 --> 20:43.441
- Thank you.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.245
- So you're out in Spain with Rob Brydon?

20:45.246 --> 20:47.401
- Yes, I'm with Rob Brydon.

20:47.402 --> 20:48.481
- That must be fun.

20:48.482 --> 20:51.639
- Yes, it's a lot of fun,
thank you very much, goodbye.

20:51.640 --> 20:52.640
- Okay, bye.

20:54.880 --> 20:59.679
- Victor Arguinzoniz uses
a cooking method so basic

20:59.680 --> 21:02.639
even cavemen would recognize it.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.206
And yet has become a point of pilgrimage

21:05.207 --> 21:07.601
for food nerds from around the world.

21:07.602 --> 21:11.571
Perhaps you regard yourself as
something of a barbecue king.

21:11.572 --> 21:14.479
Compared to Victor you are a lightweight.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.679
Little better than the caveman,

21:16.680 --> 21:19.968
who first cracked the flints
together to get a spark

21:19.969 --> 21:24.079
because he found raw mammoth
a bit tough on the teeth.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.606
So it's essentially a barbecue.

21:37.480 --> 21:38.288
Oh.

21:38.289 --> 21:40.159
- The fresh cheese.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.002
- Thank you.

21:41.003 --> 21:42.679
- And the gold butter.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.522
- Ah.
- Thank you.

21:43.523 --> 21:45.279
- They are homemade.

21:45.280 --> 21:48.079
We have buffaloes in our farmhouse

21:48.080 --> 21:52.399
and every clay to milk and
Victor makes the fresh cheese.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.287
Enjoy.-

21:53.288 --> 21:54.765
- Thank you, Ella.
- Thank you.

21:54.766 --> 21:58.204
What she was saying was that
they have their own buffaloes.

21:58.205 --> 22:00.239
- Wasn't she saying it in English?

22:00.240 --> 22:01.241
My sunny side were just...

22:01.242 --> 22:04.119
- Your hearing, I've noticed your hearing

22:04.120 --> 22:05.042
is not what it was.

22:05.043 --> 22:06.201
Do you mind me saying that?

22:06.202 --> 22:08.999
- Listen, stop distracting you and me

22:09.000 --> 22:11.842
from the fact that your
Spanish is appalling.

22:11.843 --> 22:13.888
I think what you were
trying to do before is

22:23.080 --> 22:24.399
- Sorry, mate, my...

22:26.080 --> 22:28.128
Bloody, bloody batteries.

22:31.440 --> 22:36.199
Wait, wait, I can't, um, it's
playing up, hang on, hang on.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.439
Right, try it again.

22:38.249 --> 22:39.359
Ah, shit.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.771
Steve, wait, wait, I
can't hear a word, mate.

22:40.772 --> 22:42.639
It's the batteries.

22:42.640 --> 22:46.039
Steve, I can't hear anything, shh.

22:46.040 --> 22:49.199
Steve, Steve, stop, wait, I've got a...

22:49.200 --> 22:50.200
Very good.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.731
- Okay, is that enough?
- Only you still can't do this

22:52.732 --> 22:54.562
can you, no matter how hard you try,

22:54.563 --> 22:57.163
you'll never be able to do
the small man in the box.

22:57.164 --> 23:00.721
- Whereas I think your small
man in the box is brilliant,

23:00.722 --> 23:04.088
it is also the apotheosis of your career.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.489
- Mm, incredible, mm.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.005
- Sum it up for me.

23:14.006 --> 23:16.810
- The butter is
life-affirming butter.

23:16.811 --> 23:20.202
- Life-affirming butter, L-A-B.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.440
The buffalo?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
- Wow.
- Wow.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.999
- This one is the homemade chorizo.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.159
We buy Iberian pork meat from Salamanca

23:46.160 --> 23:49.799
and Victor makes the chorizo
like his grandmother.

23:49.800 --> 23:50.642
- Wow.

23:50.643 --> 23:53.962
- Is same chorizo, just cooked or cured.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.999
- Cooked or cured, okay.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.279
- And one corn croquette.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.165
- I just got...
- You're welcome.

24:02.925 --> 24:07.439
- When she said he makes
chorizo like his grandmother

24:07.440 --> 24:10.239
is that what she looked like?

24:10.240 --> 24:13.205
- No, Rob, he means the way his
grandmother used to make it.

24:13.206 --> 24:15.679
- Fine, well, I think
she should be more clear.

24:15.680 --> 24:16.488
- Hm.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.959
- Because I'm picturing
a grizzled old woman

24:18.960 --> 24:21.201
with the external appearance of chorizo.

24:21.202 --> 24:23.679
- Well, you're the
only person who is, mate.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.680
- Ah.
- Mm.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.079
Fantastic.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.319
- Mm.
- Mm.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.759
- Wow.
- I know.

24:31.760 --> 24:35.890
If his grandmother tasted
like this, I'd have a nibble.

24:39.080 --> 24:42.039
Come, come, Mr. Coogan, come, come.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.679
You're beginning to thaw,
sir, beginning to thaw.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.082
- No, I will laugh at stuff if it's good.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.679
- The shoulder.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.359
- What have you clone to it?

24:57.360 --> 24:58.838
- Just gettin' outta bed in the morning.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.682
Just pulled it.

24:59.683 --> 25:00.839
- You can't rush outta bed.

25:00.840 --> 25:02.683
You've gotta, you know
what I've been told to do?

25:02.684 --> 25:04.759
Stretch while lying down.

25:04.760 --> 25:08.759
- Gets your blood flowing.
- Before you rotate it?

25:08.760 --> 25:10.489
- You look like a tentative Nazi.

25:13.080 --> 25:16.319
- Oh, I sink vhat ve're doing, you know,

25:16.320 --> 25:20.319
is so wrong on so many
levels, but I just can't stop.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.759
- Why are your Nazis so camp?

25:22.760 --> 25:24.479
Oh, I'm a Nazi, Oh.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.279
- You tell me, Fuehrer.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.406
- Heil Hitler.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.407
Was he furious?

25:29.408 --> 25:30.765
- Mm, he will be.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.439
- Okay, we continue.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.566
Green mussels.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.799
With carrot juice.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.529
- Carrot juice?
- Yes.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.171
- Bueno.

25:50.123 --> 25:51.243
- Oh, no, no, Steve.

25:51.244 --> 25:52.526
- Oh.
- Look, look, look.

25:52.527 --> 25:53.599
- Go on then.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.440
- But what do we do?

25:54.441 --> 25:55.280
We, we...

25:55.281 --> 25:56.086
- You just take them.

25:56.087 --> 25:57.087
- Uh-huh.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.210
- Mm, wow.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.686
- Well, here it is, Mr. Coogan,
we managed to get it out.

26:04.687 --> 26:08.162
Um, I mean, the good news is, it's benign.

26:09.160 --> 26:13.559
The bad news is, we
found seven more of them.

26:13.560 --> 26:16.530
Some of them have gone
into the lymph nodes.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.086
Are you gonna read that
book while we eat lunch,

26:24.087 --> 26:26.559
or you just brought it as a sort of badge?

26:26.560 --> 26:29.679
- No, I brought it, so, because I'm,

26:29.680 --> 26:32.119
I'm emulating his journey.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.039
- As I walked out one summer morning.

26:34.040 --> 26:34.962
What would your version be?

26:34.963 --> 26:39.119
As I drove out one summer
morning in my V8 Land Rover.

26:39.120 --> 26:39.962
- Range Rover.

26:39.963 --> 26:42.725
- Range Rover, sorry,
that's a terrible mistake.

26:42.726 --> 26:43.839
- Yeah.

26:43.840 --> 26:46.159
- How much have you read?

26:46.160 --> 26:48.079
- Um, about a quarter,

26:48.080 --> 26:50.839
- but it's very good.
- For a thick book.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.119
- Lord, no.

26:59.120 --> 27:02.279
- One sauvignon blanc
- Ah, yes.

27:02.280 --> 27:05.250
- To link with the grilled scallops.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.919
The caviar is from Iran.

27:08.920 --> 27:09.919
Enjoy.-

27:09.920 --> 27:12.526
- It's stupendous, Iranian caviar.

27:12.527 --> 27:14.399
- Please, go first.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.290
- No, no, no,
no, please, you go first.

27:17.291 --> 27:19.959
- Well, before I do, Scaramanga,

27:19.960 --> 27:22.639
why don't I turn them that way?

27:22.640 --> 27:26.563
In which case, should you have
interfered with my scallops...

27:26.564 --> 27:28.244
- In my country it is always traditional

27:28.245 --> 27:32.599
that the nearest scallop
is served to the guest.

27:32.600 --> 27:36.321
- Where I come from it
is a custom to proffer

27:37.800 --> 27:41.279
the larger scallop to the guest.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.282
- In my country when such an offer is made

27:43.283 --> 27:47.199
it is traditional to turn
the plate 'round twice

27:47.200 --> 27:49.521
and replace it on the table.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.485
- Come, come, Mr. Bond,
you enjoy the scallop

27:53.486 --> 27:55.159
just as much as I do.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.160
Please, eat.

28:11.840 --> 28:12.966
- Bottoms up.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.930
- Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.685
Mr. Bond, goodbye.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.879
- You should pay more
attention to your chef.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.560
He's working for Her Majesty's government.

28:41.880 --> 28:45.999
- Starter for 10, what
is the Camino de Santiago?

28:46.000 --> 28:46.922
- Um.
- No?

28:46.923 --> 28:50.720
The pilgrims' route to
Santiago to Compostela,

28:52.200 --> 28:54.521
where Saint James is
supposed to be buried.

28:54.522 --> 28:58.079
Became the most important
destination for Christians

28:58.080 --> 29:00.439
after Rome and Jerusalem.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.006
- I meant only to the ultimate
pilgrimage, to see the pope.

29:03.007 --> 29:04.682
I went there with Philomena.

29:04.683 --> 29:06.405
I introduced Philomena to the pope.

29:06.406 --> 29:09.079
- And we welcome Philomena
back into the conversation.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.286
It's been a good five to six minutes

29:10.287 --> 29:11.765
since he last brought it up.

29:11.766 --> 29:13.519
But no, no, go on, always nice to hear.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.362
- Well, I mean, you know.

29:14.363 --> 29:15.759
- So you were there for what?

29:15.760 --> 29:16.600
- For the Cannes publicity tour?
- I can't pretend it's not

29:16.601 --> 29:18.123
been a significant part of
my life, but there you go.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.929
- I can't pretend it's not
been a significant part

29:19.930 --> 29:21.809
of this bloody journey.

29:41.720 --> 29:42.801
- Ah.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.763
- This is nice, isn't it.

29:45.764 --> 29:47.285
- Wonderful.
- Lovely.

29:47.286 --> 29:51.079
- You look like the man
who'd follow James Bond,

29:51.080 --> 29:54.759
not at a distance, in one
of the Sean Connery films.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.125
- One of the early films.
- Who would never say anything

29:56.126 --> 29:58.279
- Yes, yes.
- He'd never speak, mysterious

29:58.280 --> 29:59.122
- Sinister figure.

29:59.123 --> 30:01.599
- Sinister figure following him, yeah.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.279
- Sos del Rey Catolico,
now what does that mean?

30:05.280 --> 30:08.559
- Ah, del rey, is the
reign, the Catholic reign,

30:08.560 --> 30:11.599
so it's the sos of the Catholic king,

30:11.600 --> 30:14.919
because that's where King
Ferdinand was born, here.

30:14.920 --> 30:15.760
- Right here.

30:15.761 --> 30:17.567
- Right here, well not here,
but, you know, 'round here.

30:17.568 --> 30:19.162
- He introduced the Spanish Inquisition?

30:19.163 --> 30:20.000
- Yes, indeed.

30:20.001 --> 30:20.808
- Are you sure about that?

30:20.809 --> 30:23.039
- He was a catalytic converter, in a way.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.324
- Very good, you're on fire.

30:24.325 --> 30:25.325
- Cheers.

30:26.600 --> 30:30.730
- You'd actually make a very
good Inquisitor, I think,

30:31.960 --> 30:33.079
for the Spanish Inquisition.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.002
- Don't take this the wrong way.
- No.

30:34.003 --> 30:35.399
- You have an inquisitive nature.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.731
- Mind, I have an inquisitive mind, yeah.

30:36.732 --> 30:39.039
- And you have a cruel side,
you do have a cruel side.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.769
- There's not really, well,
it's certainly a short leap

30:40.770 --> 30:44.890
isn't it, from curiosity
to, uh, murderous intent.

30:45.960 --> 30:48.359
I mean, uh, I mean,
it's quite a large leap.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.044
- It's a very large leap.
- It's a big leap.

30:50.045 --> 30:52.441
If I was questioning you
and you were on the rack,

30:52.442 --> 30:55.522
I'd start out with some
simple questions like,

30:55.523 --> 30:57.681
I'd just say, okay, just warm yourself up.

30:57.682 --> 30:59.159
Just give me a name, address,

30:59.160 --> 31:00.127
tell me what you had for breakfast.

31:00.128 --> 31:02.039
- Rob Brydon, London.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.084
- Yeah, and what'd you have for breakfast.

31:04.085 --> 31:06.359
- Scrambled eggs.
- Lovely stuff, okay.

31:06.360 --> 31:07.325
<i>- Uh, Rob...
- Ks that 'm?</i>

31:07.326 --> 31:08.160
- Can I go now?
- No, no, no.

31:08.161 --> 31:09.002
Gonna ask you a few more questions.

31:09.003 --> 31:11.970
- Just, uh, just take it easy.
- I can't, it's really hurting

31:11.971 --> 31:15.199
- What is your favorite kind of music?

31:15.200 --> 31:17.519
- Bruce Springsteen.
- Okay, all right, okay.

31:17.520 --> 31:18.601
- Is that is?
- No, no, no.

31:18.602 --> 31:22.239
No, no, no, how many BAFTAs have you won?

31:22.240 --> 31:23.080
- What?

31:23.081 --> 31:23.922
- How many BAFTAs have you won?

31:23.923 --> 31:25.519
- I can't hear you.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.719
- Okay, okay, just give
it another notch, guys.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.563
- How many BAFTAs...
- I've a Welsh one.

31:29.564 --> 31:31.449
- I've got a Welsh one.
- Well, one Welsh BAFTA.

31:31.450 --> 31:34.039
Thank you, you see how easy that was?

31:34.040 --> 31:36.486
You see how easy it was
to answer the question?

31:36.487 --> 31:38.079
Okay, now...

31:38.080 --> 31:39.718
- I've been nominated seven
times for the normal ones.

31:39.720 --> 31:40.687
- I didn't ask you that.

31:40.688 --> 31:41.966
Notch, give him another notch.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.439
How tall is he?

31:45.440 --> 31:46.799
Five 8 1/2.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.119
- Ooh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.361
- Ooh, ooh.
- That's not bad, eh?

31:51.362 --> 31:54.519
Okay, one more question that
you won't want to answer,

31:54.520 --> 31:55.885
because we're trying to
get you up to five-nine.

31:55.886 --> 31:58.446
I'm on your side here.

31:58.447 --> 32:00.559
Do you want to quit at
five-eight, five 8 1/2,

32:00.560 --> 32:01.719
or do you want to go for five-nine?

32:01.720 --> 32:02.562
- I'll go for five-nine!

32:02.563 --> 32:04.289
- He's gonna go for the five-foot-nine!

32:04.290 --> 32:05.919
Okay, one more question.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.559
- Oh, sh!
- Rob.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.359
- Yeah.
- Do you believe

32:09.360 --> 32:11.679
in the Lord God Almighty?

32:11.680 --> 32:13.199
- I'd rather not say.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.962
Get him a couple notches.

32:14.963 --> 32:16.562
- And we're at five-nine.
- Oh, thanks.

32:16.563 --> 32:17.686
- Five-nine, let him go.

32:17.687 --> 32:21.519
You leave here as a five-foot-nine
man, congratulations.

32:21.520 --> 32:22.405
- Thank you, Steve.

32:22.406 --> 32:23.811
- Oh, I've hit my head.
- I'm sorry for the pain.

32:23.813 --> 32:24.924
There you go, that's gonna be a problem

32:24.925 --> 32:25.805
you're gonna have to contend with now,

32:25.806 --> 32:27.450
and you shall have to let
your trousers down, too.

32:27.451 --> 32:30.091
Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Brydon.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.686
' Oh-ah!

33:18.800 --> 33:20.881
- This is the area
Terry Gilliam was in

33:20.882 --> 33:22.839
when he was trying to do Don Quixote.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.205
- Lost in La Mancha is the documentary

33:24.206 --> 33:25.770
about his failure to do so.

33:25.771 --> 33:28.119
- It's a show I would like to do

33:28.120 --> 33:28.960
- about La Mancha.
- Lost in La Mancha?

33:28.961 --> 33:30.450
- Oh, Man of La Mancha?
- Man of La Mancha

33:30.451 --> 33:32.039
is the stage musical.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.361
It might be my next theatrical venture.

33:34.362 --> 33:35.679
- Really?
- Yes.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.729
You get to sing The Impossible Dream.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.119
Given that this is Rioja,

33:43.120 --> 33:45.999
I would've thought we'd
see a lot more vines.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.525
- It's of no interest
to me these clays, Rob,

33:47.526 --> 33:50.759
because I no longer drink alcohol.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.081
- I like wine, I like Rioja.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.359
What's with all the dinosaur signs?

33:59.360 --> 34:00.771
- I suppose there's lots of dinosaurs

34:00.772 --> 34:03.399
that used to live 'round here.

34:03.400 --> 34:07.119
- I say we visit, because
Chloe loves dinosaurs.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.438
- Who's Chloe?

34:08.440 --> 34:09.440
My daughter.

34:09.442 --> 34:10.487
- Oh.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.679
- I'm gonna put my boots on.

34:48.679 --> 34:50.639
- Your boots on?
- Yeah.

34:50.639 --> 34:51.482
Dusty.

34:51.483 --> 34:53.608
- We're gonna go in there?

34:57.960 --> 34:59.879
- Love these boots.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.804
- Yeah, no, they're
good intermediate walking shoes,

35:02.805 --> 35:05.406
those, but you couldn't touch Crampons,

35:05.407 --> 35:07.359
if there was any ice.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.803
- I don't plan to go on any ice.

35:09.804 --> 35:11.285
- No one plans for ice, Rob.

35:11.286 --> 35:12.441
You gotta be prepared

35:12.442 --> 35:14.079
if some suddenly appears.

35:14.080 --> 35:14.922
You see?

35:14.923 --> 35:18.481
They're not very good
for scree work either.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.887
You just gotta be decisive
about where you put your feet,

35:21.888 --> 35:22.888
that's all.

35:25.720 --> 35:29.406
- Do a picture of
me with the dinosaur.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.559
- Which one's the dinosaur?

35:40.400 --> 35:43.359
Okay, uh, seeing as the dinosaur's doing

35:43.360 --> 35:48.079
a McCartney-style thumbs up,
then why don't you mimic that?

35:48.080 --> 35:49.809
- Hey, rock-and-roll.

35:51.480 --> 35:55.319
I mean, Ringo, he was actually
a good drummer, you know.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.527
What's that dinosaur called?

35:57.528 --> 35:59.921
- Barney.
- No, it's a T. Rex.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.559
- It's actually not, it's a Iguanodon.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.319
- How do you know?

36:05.320 --> 36:06.959
- Throw the phone?

36:06.960 --> 36:09.839
Because Chloe is an expert.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.001
- Well, tell me this.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.365
Why have they changed the name

36:12.366 --> 36:15.039
of a Brontosaurus to a Brachiosaurus?

36:15.040 --> 36:15.880
No one else have given me

36:15.881 --> 36:17.848
- an adequate explanation.
- Brontosaurus which would

36:17.849 --> 36:20.319
previously roam the lands.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.284
- Who's that?
- It's John Hurt.

36:22.285 --> 36:23.359
- That's not John Hurt.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.200
- Who is it then?

36:24.201 --> 36:25.565
- I don't know, but if
you're gonna do John Hurt,

36:25.566 --> 36:26.879
you have to, um...

36:26.880 --> 36:30.441
The Brachiosaurus would
once roam the land,

36:31.720 --> 36:34.279
the king of all it surveyed.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.770
- That's a very good John Hurt.

36:35.771 --> 36:37.922
- King of all he surveyed.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.041
It's a combination of him as

36:42.040 --> 36:46.039
Quentin Crisp and Caligula in I, Claudius.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.769
- Why are you standing?
- You can go away now, Rob.

36:47.770 --> 36:51.890
I was thinking of killing
you, but I've changed my mind.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.479
So does Chloe know
about the different, uh,

36:56.480 --> 36:57.766
prehistoric periods.

36:57.767 --> 36:59.159
- Yep-

36:59.160 --> 37:01.599
Well, you know, she, not to where

37:01.600 --> 37:03.762
- she could sit an exam.
- Does she know Triassic,

37:03.763 --> 37:05.489
Jurassic, Cretaceous?

37:06.880 --> 37:08.803
- She knows some of
those, she knows the words.

37:08.804 --> 37:13.399
I'm not gonna pretend that
she could give a lecture.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.165
- Of course in the Triassic period

37:17.400 --> 37:21.879
the world is one land
mass, just with the sea,

37:21.880 --> 37:23.924
and that was it, one body of land.

37:23.925 --> 37:25.684
And in the Jurassic period,

37:25.685 --> 37:29.239
split into two big lumps of land.

37:29.240 --> 37:31.368
And then finally the Cretaceous,

37:31.369 --> 37:34.999
it broke off into the
continents that we know today.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.491
- Oh, look there.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.479
The actual footprints.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.084
- They're big aren't they?

37:45.085 --> 37:47.159
What size are your feet?

37:47.160 --> 37:48.160
- Seven.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.726
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:53.080 --> 37:54.486
- Go on, then, off you go.

37:54.487 --> 37:56.159
- No, it's just that is quite feminine.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.685
- They're too small.
- Quite feminine.

37:57.686 --> 37:59.123
- They are feminine, I know.

37:59.124 --> 38:01.042
- I'm not gonna be...
- Small feet.

38:01.043 --> 38:03.359
Nice on a woman but weird on a bloke.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.360
- Indeed.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.479
If I could change one thing about me,

38:08.480 --> 38:09.527
well, it wouldn't be the feet,

38:09.528 --> 38:12.119
but I would get to the feet quite soon.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.884
- It'd be feet, height,
and hair, wouldn't it?

38:13.885 --> 38:15.405
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.600
- Ah.
- Oh.

38:35.920 --> 38:36.762
- Gracias.

38:36.763 --> 38:38.119
- Muchas gracias.

38:38.120 --> 38:39.359
- Muchas, muchas gracias.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.280
- Well?

38:45.320 --> 38:46.759
- No, thank you.

38:48.880 --> 38:49.927
- What was he asking?

38:49.928 --> 38:52.287
- Do you want some more wine.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.439
Mm, mm.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.519
- Terrible year in many ways.

39:02.520 --> 39:04.566
If you think about the
number of people who've died.

39:05.403 --> 39:06.759
I mean gifted people.

39:06.760 --> 39:07.760
- Yeah.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.243
David Bowie's death was like,

39:10.244 --> 39:11.401
what did Tony Visconti say?

39:11.402 --> 39:13.679
It was an artistic actor's death.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.489
- What he did was remarkable.
- He just disappeared.

39:15.490 --> 39:17.641
No funeral, he literally just went fshoo.

39:17.642 --> 39:19.759
- Had a song called
Lazarus on his last record.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.649
- Yeah, it was wonderful,
it was actually brilliant.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.359
- Yeah, it was, it was admirable.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.124
Told you about the time
he was on the radio,

39:25.125 --> 39:27.122
and, uh, he wanted to mention me,

39:27.123 --> 39:30.239
but couldn't remember my name.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.048
- Really?

39:31.049 --> 39:32.565
- Mm, he was being interviewed,

39:32.566 --> 39:34.799
and, uh, the interviewer said,

39:34.800 --> 39:38.600
what do you do when
you're on tour on the bus?

39:39.520 --> 39:42.319
And he said he watched Cruise
of the Gods that we did.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.606
And he said, you know, the one that,

39:43.607 --> 39:45.559
it stars that guy.

39:45.560 --> 39:46.400
- And he said, who?
- Really?

39:46.401 --> 39:47.208
- Yeah, he said, who?

39:47.209 --> 39:49.926
And I was in the kitchen,
and I, oh, what, my god,

39:49.927 --> 39:51.519
he's about to mention me, David Bowie.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.360
- Sure he didn't mean me?

39:52.361 --> 39:53.247
- No, no, no, no, because he said,

39:53.248 --> 39:55.604
you know, the one from Marion and Geoff.

39:55.605 --> 39:56.639
- Really?
- Yes.

39:56.640 --> 39:57.482
- He said Marion and Geoff?
- Yes.

39:57.483 --> 39:59.524
- Wow.
- And I was going it's me!

39:59.525 --> 40:01.363
And the interviewer was going,

40:01.364 --> 40:03.759
Oh, I don't know, I don't know.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.330
So he never said my name.

40:05.331 --> 40:08.559
But he was thinking of
my face at that moment.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.919
And when he died, I looked
at has Twitter feed,

40:11.920 --> 40:12.967
and do you know what, Steve?

40:12.968 --> 40:15.088
He followed me on Twitter.

40:16.080 --> 40:16.920
- Really?

40:16.921 --> 40:19.082
- You don't know what to do
with that information, do you?

40:19.083 --> 40:20.764
- Well, no disrespect to you,

40:20.765 --> 40:23.679
but he's just ever so slightly,

40:23.680 --> 40:28.319
I mean, microscopically
diminished in my mind.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.721
- Just think, and I know
you won't like this,

40:30.722 --> 40:32.882
there remained a time when he sat there

40:32.883 --> 40:35.439
with his phone, and went,

40:35.440 --> 40:37.399
♪ Shall I follow him?

40:37.400 --> 40:40.639
♪ Shall I follow him

40:40.640 --> 40:42.559
♪ Shall I
♪ I think I shall

40:42.560 --> 40:44.119
♪ He's funny

40:44.120 --> 40:47.727
♪ Shall I follow Rob Brydon

40:48.920 --> 40:50.799

40:50.800 --> 40:53.279

40:57.920 --> 41:00.559
♪ And that is when it was

41:00.560 --> 41:04.039
♪ In his later years

41:04.040 --> 41:05.485
And he would've pressed on that button

41:05.486 --> 41:09.530
and clicked and followed
me and seen every Tweet.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.241
- And as you know
this was a Moorish castle,

41:33.242 --> 41:35.288
and when it was conquered
by the Christians

41:35.289 --> 41:37.479
it became the official residence

41:37.480 --> 41:39.289
of the.

41:39.290 --> 41:41.599
- Please.
- Thank you.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.204
- You're welcome.

41:43.205 --> 41:44.999
And during the Civil War,

41:45.000 --> 41:48.679
the town was bombarded
by the Condor Legion

41:48.680 --> 41:50.479
and the castle was hit...

41:50.480 --> 41:51.811
- At Castelo Guernica?

41:51.812 --> 41:56.359
- Yeah, la Guernica, the
last resistance of the town

41:56.360 --> 41:58.319
took place in the cathedral.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.799
And it was bombarded
too, and they surrendered

42:00.800 --> 42:03.483
because they didn't
have any more ammunition

42:03.484 --> 42:05.528
- Yes, of course, wow.
- Or food to resist

42:05.529 --> 42:06.931
the final attack.

42:08.720 --> 42:11.879
Over there we have a
room that was a setting

42:11.880 --> 42:15.646
for a Marlon Brando's
movie in the early '90s.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.959
He played the role of Friar Torquemada,

42:19.960 --> 42:21.845
who was the Grand Inquisitor here.

42:21.846 --> 42:23.569
- Of course, the Spanish Inquisition.

42:23.570 --> 42:26.359
- Yeah.
- Nobody expects that.

42:26.360 --> 42:30.239
- Monty Python.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.363
- I love them, too.

42:31.364 --> 42:32.799
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.847
- Good.
- Please, after you.

42:33.848 --> 42:36.079
- To the left.
- Yes, of course.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.525
- This is Jonathan.

42:37.526 --> 42:39.959
- Hey, Jonathan, Steve Coogan.

42:39.960 --> 42:42.759
- Steve, hey, how are you, man?

42:42.760 --> 42:43.919
- Good, how are you?

42:43.920 --> 42:45.410
- Yeah, I'm great, so, listen,

42:45.411 --> 42:47.359
I spoke to the studio.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.202
- Mm-hmm.

42:48.203 --> 42:50.005
- And they like the script.

42:50.006 --> 42:52.128
They're totally on board for this film.

42:52.129 --> 42:54.119
- Fantastic, great.
- Yeah?

42:54.120 --> 42:55.042
- What's the catch?

42:55.043 --> 42:59.319
- Yeah, uh, they
want to bring a new writer on.

42:59.320 --> 43:00.240
- What?

43:00.241 --> 43:01.321
- Well, it's for a polish,

43:01.322 --> 43:03.002
it's just for a polish, it's...

43:03.003 --> 43:04.406
- Hey, how are we doing?

43:04.407 --> 43:05.731
- Hello, how are you?

43:05.732 --> 43:07.679
- Yeah, really good.

43:07.680 --> 43:10.559
Ah, oh, where'd you get that?

43:10.560 --> 43:11.721
- I found out here.

43:11.722 --> 43:14.166
- I thought you'd lost that,
I thought I'd hidden it.

43:14.167 --> 43:15.719
Who?

43:15.720 --> 43:17.243
- Ed Hirsch.

43:17.244 --> 43:18.439
- I don't, who's he?

43:18.440 --> 43:19.280
Never heard of him.

43:19.281 --> 43:20.086
What's he clone?

43:20.087 --> 43:21.366
- He's written a few
scripts that have really

43:21.367 --> 43:22.771
just gotten a lot of heat.

43:22.772 --> 43:23.999
- Look over here!

43:24.000 --> 43:26.119
Charlie, I'm here, look!

43:26.120 --> 43:26.882
A little fella that...

43:26.883 --> 43:28.243
- Uh.
- There, hello.

43:28.244 --> 43:31.289
- He's new, he's
hot, he's up and coming.

43:31.290 --> 43:35.279
- I've got
two Oscar nominations.

43:35.280 --> 43:39.279
I'm new, and I'm not up
and coming, I've arrived.

43:46.080 --> 43:47.080
Oh.

43:48.440 --> 43:49.559
- Good evening.

43:49.560 --> 43:52.559
- Good evening.
- Buenos tardes.

43:52.560 --> 43:54.959
Isn't it a magnificent room?

43:54.960 --> 43:56.639
- It's the Brando room.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.999
I just watched a little
clip on YouTube of him.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.839
You can't really work up
exactly where they are.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.479
He's very overweight at that stage.

44:06.480 --> 44:09.479
- Yeah, which is fine for Torquemada.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.879
Gives him presence.

44:11.880 --> 44:14.319
- I'm gonna be playing Torquemada

44:14.320 --> 44:17.079
from the Spanish Inquisition.

44:17.080 --> 44:20.479
- Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

44:20.480 --> 44:22.959
- Nobody does.
- Amongst our weaponry

44:22.960 --> 44:25.639
are such diverse elements
as fear, surprise,

44:25.640 --> 44:26.607
a ruthless efficiency,

44:26.608 --> 44:28.841
and an almost fanatical
devotion to the pope.

44:28.842 --> 44:30.959
And nice red uniforms.

44:30.960 --> 44:34.599
- Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

44:34.600 --> 44:37.809
Amongst our weaponry is fear, surprise,

44:38.920 --> 44:40.599
a ruthless efficiency,

44:40.600 --> 44:43.645
and an almost fanatical
devotion to the pope.

44:43.646 --> 44:45.083
- You're doing him in The Godfather.

44:45.084 --> 44:46.159
- Huh.
- You're just doing Marlon

44:46.160 --> 44:48.208
- Brando in The Godfather.
- Just doing '70's Brando.

44:48.209 --> 44:50.484
And it was more like this,
and, like, kinda nasally.

44:50.485 --> 44:52.528
- You know what, his
voice was a little higher,

44:52.529 --> 44:53.799
the way he spoke.

44:53.800 --> 44:58.359
It was, you know, it
was like that, you know?

44:58.360 --> 44:59.519
- You've got a De Niro thing.
- When he spoke to people.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.759
- Why are you doing your De Niro.

45:00.760 --> 45:03.523
- If I was going De Niro, I'd
do it like that, you know?

45:03.524 --> 45:04.846
That's the way,

45:04.847 --> 45:06.559
that's the way De Niro spoke, you know?

45:06.560 --> 45:07.402
- That's good.
- Let's do something

45:07.403 --> 45:08.439
about that, you know?

45:08.440 --> 45:09.282
That's right, you know what I'm' gonna do?

45:09.283 --> 45:10.439
I'm gonna rip your head off,

45:10.440 --> 45:11.726
shit down your goddam fuckin' neck,

45:11.727 --> 45:14.041
you two-bit, dick-suckin',
motherfuckin' asshole.

45:14.042 --> 45:15.519
- That's terrific, that's terrific.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.361
- Yeah, well, the reason
you think I'm doing De Niro

45:17.362 --> 45:19.044
when I'm doing Brando, is
because De Niro himself

45:19.045 --> 45:21.079
was influenced by Brando.

45:21.080 --> 45:23.479
So when De Niro acts,

45:23.480 --> 45:27.119
you see residual elements of Brando

45:27.120 --> 45:29.009
in what he does, so you've
got it the wrong way around.

45:29.010 --> 45:31.284
- So in attempting to criticize you,

45:31.285 --> 45:33.085
I've inadvertently complimented you.

45:33.086 --> 45:34.762
- You've shown up some of the detail...

45:34.763 --> 45:38.526
- You shall only come out on
top in this exchange, then.

45:38.527 --> 45:41.559
- I'm only telling you the truth.

45:41.560 --> 45:44.479
- Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

45:44.480 --> 45:47.239
And nobody expects a comfy chair.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.527
- No, he's gotta do the, get

45:50.960 --> 45:53.759
the comfy chair.

45:53.760 --> 45:55.524
- Get the comfy chair.

45:59.560 --> 46:02.439
I'm like a turtle, look at me.

46:02.440 --> 46:04.719
- Get the comfy chair.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.839
- Get the comfy chair
and a piece of lettuce.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.239
I'm gettin' hungry.

46:09.240 --> 46:13.359
Amongst our weaponry is
such diverse I, to me,

46:13.360 --> 46:15.249
- Woody Allen.
- Woody Allen, yeah.

46:15.250 --> 46:19.404
- Yeah, amongst our weaponry
is such diverse elements as

46:20.640 --> 46:22.005
fear, surprise,

46:23.600 --> 46:27.571
and an almost fanatical
devotion to the Yankees.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.480
- Meh.

46:43.120 --> 46:45.168
- Do you wish to confess?

46:46.480 --> 46:47.480
- No.

46:49.640 --> 46:53.119
- You know all Jews were
told to leave the country

46:53.120 --> 46:55.799
by order of the Catholic king and queen.

46:55.800 --> 46:59.039
- Yes, but, I'm, I'm not a Jew.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.566
I'm a Catholic, Roman Catholic.

47:02.720 --> 47:06.281
- If you're Catholic, then
you must respect my authority.

47:06.282 --> 47:08.123
My authority comes from the pope.

47:08.124 --> 47:10.319
- I've met the pope.

47:10.320 --> 47:13.639
What it was, I met the
pope, I met His Holiness

47:13.640 --> 47:17.839
at the Vatican, and he saw a film I made.

47:17.840 --> 47:19.285
- You're lying.
- I'm telling the truth.

47:19.286 --> 47:21.404
All right, all right,
he didn't see the film,

47:21.405 --> 47:25.007
his advisors did, and they gave
him a breakdown of the film,

47:25.008 --> 47:26.570
and he approved it.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.519
- You're, um, a heretic?

47:29.520 --> 47:32.639
- I am not a heretic, I'm
not Jewish, I'm not Muslim,

47:32.640 --> 47:33.641
I am a Roman Catholic.

47:33.642 --> 47:35.399
I promise you, I don't know the Quran,

47:35.400 --> 47:36.561
I hardly know the Old Testament.

47:36.562 --> 47:39.319
I was an altar boy, um...

47:39.320 --> 47:40.320
- Shh.

47:42.280 --> 47:44.567
Do you respect my authority?

47:46.320 --> 47:47.519
- Well.

47:47.520 --> 47:50.039
- Do you respect my authority?

47:50.040 --> 47:52.008
- Why are you,
why are you mumbling?

47:52.009 --> 47:54.002
- What, what did you say?

47:55.320 --> 47:57.891
- You're not enunciating, enuncio.

47:57.892 --> 48:00.279
- I'm sorry, Esteban.

48:00.280 --> 48:02.601
Do you respect my authority?

48:05.480 --> 48:07.524
- Yes, I, yes I respect your authority.

48:07.525 --> 48:08.567
- Take him away.

48:10.160 --> 48:12.561
- Do you know exactly
what's going to happen now?

48:12.562 --> 48:14.604
I've not done anything, have I?

48:14.605 --> 48:16.644
Why are they taking me backwards?

48:16.645 --> 48:18.130
I've not done anything.

48:29.160 --> 48:33.290
Hey, guess where I'm taking
Joe at the end of this week.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.200
Here, look.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.280
- Zip wire?

48:38.281 --> 48:39.122
- Yeah.

48:39.123 --> 48:40.159
Longest one in Spain.

48:40.160 --> 48:41.002
- Have you clone this already?

48:41.003 --> 48:43.526
- Yeah, I've done
about five in the UK,

48:43.527 --> 48:45.599
couple in Europe.

48:45.600 --> 48:48.559
- Word of warning, what's
the age limit on this?

48:48.560 --> 48:50.130
- There's no age limit,
as long as you fit.

48:50.131 --> 48:52.359
There's a height restriction.

48:52.360 --> 48:54.361
- Well, we were in Italy last year,

48:54.362 --> 48:56.203
and there was whitewater rafting.

48:56.204 --> 48:57.439
' Yeah?

48:57.440 --> 49:01.411
- So I thought I'd check
out, you know, the age.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.680
Eight to 55.

49:06.240 --> 49:08.082
So by the time Charlie's
old enough to do it

49:08.083 --> 49:09.605
- I'll be too old.
- That's ridiculous.

49:09.606 --> 49:10.761
- I know.
- 55?

49:11.600 --> 49:12.522
That's ridiculous.

49:12.523 --> 49:15.043
- Why can you not whitewater raft at 55?

49:15.044 --> 49:17.324
I might get some fake ID
or something like that.

49:17.325 --> 49:19.891
- Yeah, you'll have to get
fake ID like a teenager.

49:19.892 --> 49:23.279
- Uh, John Jones, born in 1970.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.279
I'm a carpenter from Wrexham.

49:25.280 --> 49:26.765
- You say you're a carpenter.

49:26.766 --> 49:29.081
- That's right.
- Simple question.

49:29.082 --> 49:33.999
If building a bog standard,
uh, tongue-and-groove,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.719
glue-and-peg wooden bench for outside,

49:36.720 --> 49:38.046
what kind of wood do you choose,

49:38.047 --> 49:40.884
if you want it to weather
into a nice silvery patina?

49:40.885 --> 49:42.291
Ash, beech, teak?

49:44.360 --> 49:45.691
Simple question.

49:47.040 --> 49:47.880
You'll have to hurry.

49:47.881 --> 49:48.881
There's other people that want to get on

49:48.882 --> 49:50.319
this whitewater raft.

49:50.320 --> 49:53.559
- Um, could you tell me the woods again?

49:53.560 --> 49:55.039
- Ash, teak, beech.

49:55.040 --> 49:57.008
- Ash, teak, beech?
- Mm.

49:58.280 --> 49:59.759
- Beech.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.879
- No, mate, it's teak.

50:01.880 --> 50:04.281
Any carpenter worth his
salt'll tell you that.

50:04.282 --> 50:05.599
- Don't cry, Charlie.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.963
- You're not, you're
not a carpenter, mate.

50:06.964 --> 50:07.800
- Please let us go on.

50:07.801 --> 50:08.926
- On your way.
- It's the only chance

50:08.927 --> 50:11.321
- I've got to, I just want...
- On your way.

50:11.322 --> 50:13.321
- Don't cry, Charlie, don't cry.

50:13.322 --> 50:14.885
Maybe Mommy can take you.

50:14.886 --> 50:16.439
Look at the boy, he's crying.

50:16.440 --> 50:18.010
- Oh come on, how old are you?
- Please don't be like...

50:18.011 --> 50:19.959
- What?
- How old are you?

50:19.960 --> 50:21.599
- I'm 56.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.759
- Oh, for Christ's sake,
go on, on your, get on.

50:23.760 --> 50:25.171
- Just, oh, please.
- Thanks, so, oh!

50:25.172 --> 50:27.319
Oh, I've got shooting pains down my arm.

50:27.320 --> 50:28.207
- Well, don't tell me that.

50:28.208 --> 50:30.487
I've just broken the
rules for you, you nob.

50:30.488 --> 50:33.599
- Give me a minute, I got lightheaded.

50:33.600 --> 50:34.879
All right, thank you.

50:34.880 --> 50:35.881
Come on, Charlie.

50:35.882 --> 50:37.245
Not so fast, son.

50:39.520 --> 50:42.679
- You know when walking downhill,

50:42.680 --> 50:44.602
it'd be good if you engage your abs.

50:44.603 --> 50:45.803
- Yeah, course.

50:45.804 --> 50:48.610
- And if you
engage your abdominals,

50:48.611 --> 50:51.079
it takes the pressure off your knees.

50:51.080 --> 50:52.762
- Who told you that?

50:52.763 --> 50:55.399
- It's just that you can
feel it anatomically.

50:55.400 --> 50:56.322
I figured it out.

50:56.323 --> 50:58.399
- Well at least stand up
to a focus group with it.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.604
- Well you wouldn't show
it to a focus group.

50:59.605 --> 51:01.441
- Clinical trials, I wouldn't
send it to clinical trials.

51:01.442 --> 51:02.771
- Exactly, they won't
show it to a focus group.

51:02.773 --> 51:04.487
- Clinical trials, that's
why I said clinical trials.

51:04.488 --> 51:06.084
- Oh, okay, yeah, you
don't need clinical trials.

51:06.085 --> 51:08.683
If you listen to your
body, you'll figure it out.

51:08.684 --> 51:09.966
It's like a shock absorber,

51:09.967 --> 51:14.319
so the knee doesn't have
to take all the impact.

51:14.320 --> 51:15.320
Wow.

51:17.800 --> 51:21.919
- Ah, big, bigger
than it looks from outside.

51:21.920 --> 51:24.810
- Hey, take your hat off in church.

51:26.080 --> 51:27.080
Bountiful.

51:28.960 --> 51:32.043
I'm trying to find out
where the bomb damage is.

51:32.044 --> 51:36.039
From, you know, from when
Franco and the Nazis.

51:36.040 --> 51:38.850
- Exhibition there, with
Cervantes and Shakespeare.

51:38.851 --> 51:40.319
There, look.

51:40.320 --> 51:42.049
Why would they have the two
of them in one exhibition.

51:42.050 --> 51:45.079
- Ah, they both died in the same year.

51:45.080 --> 51:47.845
It seems they've done
a very good repair job.

51:47.846 --> 51:49.246
Can't see any damage.

51:49.247 --> 51:52.764
- Well, maybe it wasn't this
part of it that got damaged.

51:52.765 --> 51:55.730
- I mean the workmanship
of this is a testament

51:55.731 --> 51:58.679
to all the workers who
helped construct it,

51:58.680 --> 52:00.405
and yet Franco, very happy,

52:00.406 --> 52:02.402
despite claiming to be a Catholic,

52:02.403 --> 52:05.599
to bomb the shit out of
a religious building.

52:05.600 --> 52:09.599
Which just shows you what
kind of a vandal he was.

52:09.600 --> 52:13.730
- We're having flooring
just like this in the kitchen.

52:15.680 --> 52:17.599
- Partners there.
- Yeah.

52:17.600 --> 52:21.571
- Buried, lying next to
each other for eternity.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.367
Brr.

52:35.160 --> 52:39.290
First collected edition of
Shakespeare's works, 1623.

52:40.640 --> 52:43.962
So, then, six years, seven
years after his death.

52:43.963 --> 52:47.359
Already they realized what they'd lost.

52:50.920 --> 52:51.920
Rob, Rob.

52:52.920 --> 52:55.207
Electronic '80s album cover.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.719
- Very good.

52:58.720 --> 53:01.519
I'm holding my stomach in while I do this.

53:01.520 --> 53:03.601
- Well, just
walking downhill is actually

53:03.602 --> 53:04.931
better for that, you know.

53:04.932 --> 53:09.084
- Yeah, but I hold it in
pretty much all the time now.

53:17.280 --> 53:19.681
Would you ever do
Shakespeare on the stage?

53:19.682 --> 53:22.919
- I would have liked
to have played Hamlet.

53:22.920 --> 53:25.730
- That train has left the station.

53:26.760 --> 53:27.999
Who would you like to play now?

53:28.000 --> 53:29.239
- Olivier played him when he was 42.

53:29.240 --> 53:31.559
- Olivier was a better actor than you.

53:31.560 --> 53:32.447
- Well, a different actor.

53:32.448 --> 53:35.639
- Better actor.
- A different actor.

53:35.640 --> 53:36.527
- King Lear?

53:36.528 --> 53:38.359
- He's, old man.

53:38.360 --> 53:39.479
- Not old, he's he a father.

53:39.480 --> 53:40.641
You've got more in common with him

53:40.642 --> 53:43.839
than you have with a teenager.

53:51.800 --> 53:52.767
Have you lost something?

53:52.768 --> 53:54.569
- She is gone forever.

53:56.800 --> 54:00.282
I know when one is living and one is dead,

54:01.280 --> 54:03.328
and she is dead as earth.

54:05.720 --> 54:08.199
Lend me a looking glass.

54:08.200 --> 54:12.250
'Cause if her breath may
mist or stain the stone,

54:14.520 --> 54:16.045
why then she lives.

54:17.240 --> 54:19.119
- Very good, very good.

54:19.120 --> 54:20.007
Midsummer Murders.

54:20.008 --> 54:22.241
You're a father who's just
been told his daughter's

54:22.242 --> 54:24.891
just been killed in a road
accident, and that is effective,

54:24.892 --> 54:29.279
and we're straight into
the adverts after that.

54:29.280 --> 54:31.926
- I have of late, though
wherefore I know not,

54:31.927 --> 54:34.486
lost all my mirth, forgone
all custom of exercises.

54:34.487 --> 54:36.764
Indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition

54:36.765 --> 54:38.683
that it's goodly frame the earth.

54:38.684 --> 54:42.439
Look you, this fine
O'erhanging firmament, the sky,

54:42.440 --> 54:45.967
it seems nothing to me but a
foul congregation of vapors.

54:45.968 --> 54:48.201
Yeah-ah, Jumping Jack Flash.

54:51.360 --> 54:54.399
Stones do Shakespeare, come on!

54:54.400 --> 54:57.722
- Oh, oh, that this too, too solid flesh

54:58.840 --> 55:02.959
would melt and resolve itself into a dew.

55:02.960 --> 55:05.319
Oh, that the Everlastin' not fix

55:05.320 --> 55:08.085
his cannon 'gainst self-slaughter.

55:09.840 --> 55:13.839
- Has Russell Brand ever clone Shakespeare?

55:13.840 --> 55:15.679
- You're doin' Mick Jagger.
- Oh, no, god.

55:15.680 --> 55:16.520
- You're doing Mick Jagger.

55:16.521 --> 55:17.487
- We", I, urn!

55:17.488 --> 55:18.719
- What you said.
- Hah!

55:18.720 --> 55:20.039
- Hah, what's that?

55:20.040 --> 55:21.644
- All right, yeah, all right.
- Huh, huh, huh!

55:21.645 --> 55:22.719
That's not Mick Jagger.

55:22.720 --> 55:23.642
- That's only noises.
- Yes it is.

55:23.643 --> 55:26.802
- Steve, you're doin' it wrong.
- Let's see what'll you have?

55:26.803 --> 55:28.165
- Quiet and let me do it.

55:28.166 --> 55:29.719
- No, you can't do it,

55:29.720 --> 55:30.685
you're copying Morrisey.

55:30.686 --> 55:31.486
And he doesn't look like that.

55:31.487 --> 55:32.320
- That's all gay.
- I see.

55:32.321 --> 55:33.162
- He does like that.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.119
- A piece of work's mine, ah-ah-ah.

55:35.120 --> 55:36.359
- He goes really deep sometimes

55:36.360 --> 55:38.085
and you can't get down there.

55:38.086 --> 55:39.241
It can only go up there.

55:39.242 --> 55:41.321
He's gotten down, so do him properly.

55:41.322 --> 55:43.399
- You saying I can't get down there.

55:43.400 --> 55:44.763
You're seriously saying
I can't get down there.

55:44.764 --> 55:46.091
- No, let's stop, but
don't just say anything

55:46.092 --> 55:47.570
about Mick Jagger.

55:57.440 --> 55:58.440
Ah.

56:03.320 --> 56:04.959
- Gracias.
- Muchas gracias.

56:05.767 --> 56:06.600
- Si, si.

56:06.601 --> 56:07.647
- Ha-ha-ha-hah.
- I like wine.

56:07.648 --> 56:09.051
No spoon or fork.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.599
Muchas gracias.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.090
- Uh-huh.

56:16.920 --> 56:19.764
- So, George Orwell came
over to Spain in 1936.

56:19.765 --> 56:20.959
- Oh.

56:20.960 --> 56:23.759
One year after the birth of Elvis.

56:23.760 --> 56:25.999
- He came out to Barcelona with his wife.

56:26.000 --> 56:26.840
- With his wife.

56:26.841 --> 56:27.680
- She stayed there,

56:27.681 --> 56:28.839
- when he went to...
- Mini-break.

56:28.840 --> 56:29.680
She stayed there,

56:29.681 --> 56:30.520
- when he went to...
- It's a good place

56:30.521 --> 56:31.442
for a mini-break.

56:31.443 --> 56:33.599
Is that what they were doing?

56:33.600 --> 56:35.519
Were they able to do that in those clays?

56:35.520 --> 56:37.488
- Do you want to learn anything
about the Civil War at all,

56:37.489 --> 56:39.199
or do you think it's like, I just think,

56:39.200 --> 56:40.725
no, I don't really give a
damn about the Civil War.

56:40.726 --> 56:42.359
Not that interested in it.

56:42.360 --> 56:43.599
- I want to learn something
about the Civil War.

56:43.600 --> 56:47.161
- Okay, so he came out to
Barcelona, left his wife there,

56:47.162 --> 56:49.683
went off to the front
to fight, 50 miles away.

56:49.684 --> 56:51.569
When he came back, he was so disillusioned

56:51.570 --> 56:54.999
with the intellectuals who
were back in Barcelona,

56:55.000 --> 56:56.729
when he went back there, he saw them all.

56:56.730 --> 56:58.399
They'd become bourgeois.

56:58.400 --> 56:59.763
They'd lost sight of their ideals.

56:59.764 --> 57:02.762
He said they were eating fancy
food in posh restaurants.

57:02.763 --> 57:04.884
So he went back to the front one more time

57:04.885 --> 57:06.723
and eventually got shot in the throat.

57:06.724 --> 57:08.799
Couldn't speak for six months.

57:08.800 --> 57:12.247
- Where's a bullet to the
throat when you need one?

57:12.248 --> 57:15.483
I don't think if I were to say to Sally,

57:16.760 --> 57:19.081
I'm going off to fight, she
wouldn't stand there, just say,

57:19.082 --> 57:21.481
all right, you're going off to be killed.

57:21.482 --> 57:23.279
- Yeah, or kill.

57:23.280 --> 57:24.559
- That's a very good point,

57:24.560 --> 57:26.083
'cause that's something
else I couldn't do.

57:26.084 --> 57:27.842
- I wouldn't fight in a
war 'cause I've got kids.

57:27.843 --> 57:28.727
- I got kids.

57:28.728 --> 57:31.559
- Yeah, but if I didn't
have kids, I think I would

57:31.560 --> 57:32.400
- be up for that.
- I don't think you would.

57:32.401 --> 57:33.240
- I think I would.

57:33.241 --> 57:34.319
- I think you'd like to think you would,

57:34.320 --> 57:35.160
but I don't think you would.

57:35.161 --> 57:36.284
You could go and entertain the troops.

57:36.285 --> 57:37.884
You could go and do Alan
Partridge for the troops,

57:37.885 --> 57:39.679
that's what you would do.

57:39.680 --> 57:42.001
And all these proper men, who
are giving over everything,

57:42.002 --> 57:44.443
would love as you came out and went ah-ha.

57:44.444 --> 57:47.205
You know what I'd love, if a
sniper got you at that moment.

57:47.206 --> 57:48.519
Ah-ugh.

57:48.520 --> 57:49.681
You didn't even finish the ah-ha.

57:49.682 --> 57:51.199
You'd only got to ah.

57:51.200 --> 57:53.999
- I'd do that hah as my dying breath.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.204
- I don't think you would.
- I would.

57:55.205 --> 57:56.006
- No, you wouldn't.
- Ah,.

57:56.007 --> 57:57.081
- If it was to the head, you idiot.

57:57.082 --> 57:58.603
- Ah, ha.

57:58.604 --> 57:59.803
- You wouldn't say ah-ha.

57:59.804 --> 58:00.926
- I'd get the ha out.

58:00.927 --> 58:02.559
- There'd be no ha.

58:02.560 --> 58:04.324
And I'd say, if Steve were here now,

58:04.325 --> 58:06.199
I know what he'd say, ha...

58:06.200 --> 58:07.200
- Ha.
- Hm.

58:14.480 --> 58:15.320
- Hello.

58:15.321 --> 58:16.242
- Hi, Steve.

58:16.243 --> 58:17.679
- Hello, Emma, love.

58:17.680 --> 58:19.362
- How are you, how's it going?

58:19.363 --> 58:21.328
- Doing very well, yes.

58:21.329 --> 58:23.919
- Good, good, how's Rob doing?

58:23.920 --> 58:26.439
- Rob is great, he's
going very well, indeed.

58:26.440 --> 58:27.883
- You're on, you're on...
- I'm good, I'm good.

58:27.884 --> 58:30.121
- Yeah, you're on speakerphone,
that's why I'm being nice.

58:30.122 --> 58:31.919
- Hiya, how are you?

58:31.920 --> 58:34.079
- I love you, I'm just, uh,
I'm calling to remind you

58:34.080 --> 58:35.445
that I'm coming out to see you tomorrow.

58:35.446 --> 58:36.599
Yay.

58:36.600 --> 58:39.479
- Thank god, I'm at a breaking point.

58:39.480 --> 58:42.719
- Oh, wow, okay, great, and
I'm bringing Yolanda with me.

58:42.720 --> 58:44.358
Due to the fact that
it's the New York Times?

58:44.360 --> 58:45.200
- Oh, great.

58:45.201 --> 58:46.042
- And the Observer

58:46.043 --> 58:48.611
- I just want to remind
you, that they do want you

58:48.612 --> 58:52.919
to dress up as Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza, okay?

58:52.920 --> 58:54.999
- What a surprise.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.044
- Which one am I?

58:56.045 --> 58:57.642
- You are to be our Sancho Panza.

58:57.643 --> 58:58.562
Hey.

58:58.563 --> 59:01.450
- Yeah, good,
supporting role, as ever.

59:15.320 --> 59:19.450
- The Parador de Cuenca
is a majestic former convent,

59:20.360 --> 59:23.879
careful, perched above the Huecar Gorge

59:23.880 --> 59:27.519
with stunning views of the old town.

59:27.520 --> 59:28.724
- Oh, so that's, look at that.

59:28.725 --> 59:29.721
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Very nice

59:29.722 --> 59:32.200
Now don't look at it too much.

59:48.040 --> 59:49.239
- Hello.

59:49.240 --> 59:50.765
- Hi, is that Rob Brydon.

59:50.766 --> 59:52.479
- Uh, speaking.

59:52.480 --> 59:54.999
- I've got Matt Jenkins for you.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
- Okay.

59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.039
- Hey, Rob Bryden.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.119
- Hello.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:01.962
Hi, Matt.

01:00:01.963 --> 01:00:03.041
- Hey, man, how you doin'?

01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:05.439
- Yeah, I'm all right, how are you?

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.282
- I'm good, how's, uh, London?

01:00:07.283 --> 01:00:08.324
- Oh, I'm in Spain.

01:00:08.325 --> 01:00:10.129
I'm not in London, I'm in Spain.

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:11.359
- Hi, Greg.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.159
- Hi, Steve, how are you?

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.679
- I've been better.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.399
Do you know they brought a new
writer on to rewrite Missing?

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.966
- Yeah, but it's nothing,
it's just, it's standard.

01:00:21.967 --> 01:00:23.803
Just for a polish, that's all.

01:00:23.804 --> 01:00:27.799
- I'm with Steve, with,
uh, with Steve Coogan.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.839
- Ah, Steve Coogan,
yeah, yeah, good, good.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.161
- Is this the Matt that's Steve's agent?

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:37.439
- Yeah, it is, well, no, I
mean, I've left the agency.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.090
We met at Sundance, you remember that.

01:00:39.091 --> 01:00:42.559
- I've got two Oscar nominations.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.722
Uh, last film I wrote had four
Academy Award nominations.

01:00:45.723 --> 01:00:47.322
- Yeah, I know, but Joey, he's really,

01:00:47.323 --> 01:00:48.924
he's great, he's up and coming.

01:00:48.925 --> 01:00:50.239
UP and coming?

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.605
I've up and come.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.402
I've already up and come.

01:00:53.403 --> 01:00:56.131
- You have, no, yeah, absolutely,
you have, Steve, you have.

01:00:56.132 --> 01:01:00.839
- Look, lemme cut to the
chase, I saw you in the

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.648
- Horseman.
- The Huntsman.

01:01:01.649 --> 01:01:04.119
- The Huntsman, saw you in The Huntsman.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.281
Thought you were fantastic, man.

01:01:05.282 --> 01:01:07.281
I mean, really, you burnt up the screen.

01:01:07.282 --> 01:01:09.404
You've got it, that little
midget walk you did.

01:01:09.405 --> 01:01:12.244
The screen loves you, but you
were being underused there.

01:01:12.245 --> 01:01:14.719
So let me cut to the chase, okay.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.562
You should be doing what
Nick Frost is doing.

01:01:17.563 --> 01:01:19.961
- Well, I did, I did
The Huntsman with him.

01:01:19.962 --> 01:01:21.166
- This is what I'm saying.

01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:24.919
You should be doing what
James Corden is doing.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.524
You know, he's the biggest thing on TV.

01:01:26.525 --> 01:01:30.039
- I was with James in Gavin & Stacey.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.639
- I heard about that, it was
supposed to be fantastic.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.449
I, I, uh, missed it, but
I'll definitely get a copy.

01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:36.807
You know, you should
be the new Simon Pegg.

01:01:36.808 --> 01:01:40.159
You should be, you could be, you will be

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.759
the new Ricky Gervais.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.725
- Oh, gosh, well, Ricky,
that's what we all dream of.

01:01:44.726 --> 01:01:46.126
- What does Jeff think of this?

01:01:46.127 --> 01:01:47.323
- Jeff's fine with it.

01:01:47.324 --> 01:01:49.684
Jeff's very busy doing another
screenplay for Fox, so he...

01:01:49.685 --> 01:01:51.959
- What script is Jeff doing for Fox?

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.800
I didn't know that.

01:01:52.801 --> 01:01:54.325
- The script for George Clooney.

01:01:54.326 --> 01:01:55.799
- The George Clooney?

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.685
Right, okay, I had no idea about that.

01:01:57.686 --> 01:01:59.804
Another thing I had no idea about.

01:01:59.805 --> 01:02:01.722
- Have you ever done any hosting?

01:02:01.723 --> 01:02:03.688
You know, the awards ceremonies?

01:02:03.689 --> 01:02:05.719
- I hosted the LA BAFTAs once.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.879
- The what?

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.439
They have LA BAFTAs?

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.766
Who do they give those to?

01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:12.479
Listen, never mind, you should
be hosting the Golden Globes.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.719
This is what I'm talkin' about.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.559
- It's my script, I wrote
it, well I co-wrote it,

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.445
I'm producing it, I'm gonna star in it,

01:02:19.446 --> 01:02:22.799
not Tim Huddleston or some
other fuckin' posh twat.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.086
- This should be the best phone call,

01:02:24.087 --> 01:02:27.839
this will be the best
phone call you've ever had.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.762
- Yes.

01:02:28.763 --> 01:02:29.839
- It's my film, okay?

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.680
- Of course it is.

01:02:30.681 --> 01:02:31.488
- That's what it's going to be.

01:02:31.489 --> 01:02:32.811
Good, thank you.

01:02:39.925 --> 01:02:42.839
- That's what you should be in.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.565
- Stands out like a sore thumb.

01:02:44.566 --> 01:02:47.679
That's what Laurie needed
to pay his way around Spain.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.680
He busked.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.888
- Thanks.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:08.399
- You know that, uh, Cuenca
was one of the last places

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.519
to fall to the Fascists in the Civil War

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.759
on March the 29th, 1939.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.645
- Terrific position,
it's up on the hilltop,

01:03:16.646 --> 01:03:19.562
so very difficult to attack,
and very easy to defend.

01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:21.403
- Yeah, and they may
very well have held out,

01:03:21.404 --> 01:03:24.399
if it weren't for the fact that the army,

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.523
the Republican army,

01:03:25.524 --> 01:03:27.282
turned against the Socialist government.

01:03:27.283 --> 01:03:30.639
If it weren't for that Franco
may have well not have won.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.640
- Hello.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.959
- I gave you money before, mate.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.323
- Oh, yeah, sorry, fellas, take care.

01:03:35.324 --> 01:03:37.207
- You can have a drink with
us, if you want, though.

01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:38.165
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:39.000
- You sure?

01:03:39.001 --> 01:03:39.965
- Yeah, have a beer.

01:03:39.966 --> 01:03:41.325
- I'm with Steve.
- That'd be lovely.

01:03:41.326 --> 01:03:42.446
- Cheers, man.
- No worries.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.247
- You sound very good.

01:03:45.248 --> 01:03:46.439
- Thank you, man.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.930
- Especially like your backing singers.

01:03:47.931 --> 01:03:49.439
- Oh, yeah, hardly Ronettes, right?

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.407
- You know them?

01:03:50.408 --> 01:03:53.006
- Um, yeah, I suppose
near acquaintances, maybe.

01:03:53.007 --> 01:03:54.919
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.725
- So you guys here on holiday?

01:03:56.726 --> 01:03:57.999
- No, we're working.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Oh, right?

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.839
- I'm writing a book about my, um,

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.799
sort of travel through Spain.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.759
Replicating a journey I did when I was,

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.602
when I was a younger man.

01:04:08.603 --> 01:04:12.959
It's kind of a little bit
inspired by Laurie Lee,

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.599
you know, When I Walked Out One

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.485
- Midsummer Morning.
- Midsummer Morning.

01:04:15.486 --> 01:04:16.561
- Yeah, I know it.
- But we're driving it.

01:04:16.562 --> 01:04:17.599
Cheers.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.599
- Cheers,
mate, yeah, I love Laurie.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.443
- That's part of the reason
when I saw you buskin' there,

01:04:21.444 --> 01:04:23.202
I thought this is our Laurie Lee,

01:04:23.203 --> 01:04:24.839
'cause he paid his way through Spain

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.680
by doing the same thing.

01:04:25.681 --> 01:04:27.170
- With a violin, yeah.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:04:27.171 --> 01:04:28.559
- Yeah, right on.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.919
So you guys staying in Cuenca long?

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.760
- One day in every place.

01:04:32.761 --> 01:04:33.568
I'm writing restaurant reviews,

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:35.479
so we go to one town, we're there a clay,

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.322
and then we go on.

01:04:36.323 --> 01:04:38.639
- Oh, have you been in
San Sebastian for food.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.005
It's the best place in Spain for food

01:04:40.006 --> 01:04:41.398
- by a country mile.
- Yeah, I know.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.684
- We were near there in Santander,

01:04:42.685 --> 01:04:43.602
- weren't we?
- Yeah.

01:04:43.603 --> 01:04:45.119
- Or Catalonia, not just Barcelona.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.199
The food there's excellent, yeah.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.087
- No.
- Yeah.

01:04:47.088 --> 01:04:48.639
Well, we just

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.085
we were gonna go there, we just thought

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:51.241
it was a bit too obvious.

01:04:51.242 --> 01:04:53.843
We're trying to do stuff
that's a little bit, kind of,

01:04:53.844 --> 01:04:55.519
the kind of nooks and crannies,

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.931
slightly off the beaten track a little.

01:04:56.932 --> 01:04:58.919
- Like Sanlucar, near Cadiz.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.886
The tuna there is absolutely
bang-on, I love that.

01:05:00.887 --> 01:05:01.722
- Yeah, I know, yeah.

01:05:01.723 --> 01:05:03.721
It's more like the culture than the food,

01:05:03.722 --> 01:05:04.999
although food's part of it,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.490
but it's more like the
kind of culture, I suppose.

01:05:06.491 --> 01:05:10.399
- But if it's food and culture
that you're lookin' for,

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.479
Valencia.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.320
- Valencia.

01:05:12.321 --> 01:05:13.160
- Yeah, you probably know it.

01:05:13.161 --> 01:05:14.239
- Casa Montana?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.558
- Yeah, that's the best.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.402
- I know.

01:05:16.403 --> 01:05:17.959
- And Valencia's got the Holy Grail.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.042
- How long does it take to
get to Valencia from here?

01:05:20.043 --> 01:05:22.201
- Valencia's like two hours
away, man, it's close.

01:05:22.202 --> 01:05:23.679
- Let's go to Valencia.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.601
- Well, no,
we're not going to Valencia.

01:05:25.602 --> 01:05:26.679
- Go to Valencia.
- We've got a whole schedule.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.520
- No.

01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:29.043
- We can go to Valencia,
it's just two hours.

01:05:29.044 --> 01:05:30.279
- We've got a schedule worked out.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.085
We've got pre-ordained
route taking in some...

01:05:33.086 --> 01:05:34.319
- Where's the fun in that?

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.679
Stray from the path, man.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.205
- We sort of are straying from the path

01:05:37.206 --> 01:05:39.399
by not going to places
like Catalonia, so...

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.399
- Oh, okay.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.402
- You can go there for us.

01:05:42.403 --> 01:05:43.559
- I will, again.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.159
- Okay, again, yeah, all right.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.650
Listen, I'm gonna head
back to the hotel anyway,

01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:49.199
so, uh, I'm gonna head off.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.245
- You're goin' back to the hotel?

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:51.082
- Yeah.
- Now?

01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:52.199
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.239
You're all right, you'll be
all right here with, uh, man.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.444
Perhaps he'll play you a few tunes.

01:05:56.445 --> 01:05:58.600
All right, mate, good luck
with your Bo Diddley stuff.

01:05:58.601 --> 01:05:59.522
- Thanks for the beer, man.

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:00.726
- No, no worries, okay.

01:06:00.727 --> 01:06:02.882
- All right, see you later.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:06.927
- Sorry 'bout that.

01:06:06.928 --> 01:06:08.159
- Touched a nerve, no more.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.324
He doesn't like to be told
things that he thinks he knows.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.559
- Hello.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.769
- Hello, you look delectable and tasty.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.799
- Like a piece of ham?

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.679
- Oh, all right, then, you look sexy.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.959
- Don't feel very sexy.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.610
Had a chat with the builders

01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:33.359
and they can't start for another month.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.359
- Hey, Mischa.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.679
- Hi, where are you?

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.199
- I had a fan phone call today.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.726
Do you remember the
agent Steve used to have

01:06:42.727 --> 01:06:44.165
in LA called Matt?

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.479
- Sort of, yeah.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.079
- Look, when you come back, I was thinking

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.559
maybe we could go out to
Rachel's for the weekend.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.479
- Fantastic,
yeah, I'd love to do that.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.447
- Nice place.

01:06:55.448 --> 01:06:57.439
- Yeah, but, you know what?

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.564
Yeah, well, we'll definitely do that,

01:06:58.565 --> 01:06:59.641
but why don't you come out earlier?

01:06:59.642 --> 01:07:01.999
- He wants me to go with him,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.319
and be represented by him in LA.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.205
- Surely there's no
point in that, is there?

01:07:07.206 --> 01:07:08.526
- Absolutely right answer.

01:07:08.527 --> 01:07:10.282
Well done, I give you two points for that.

01:07:10.283 --> 01:07:12.044
And that is what I will be telling

01:07:12.045 --> 01:07:15.879
this little American
fellow in me own way, uh...

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.399
- And it's too far away from me.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.367
- Yeah, of course it is.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:20.761
- But isn't Joe supposed to come out?

01:07:20.762 --> 01:07:22.804
- Yeah, but he
can do his own thing.

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:24.163
You know, he's a big boy.

01:07:24.164 --> 01:07:25.683
- How old is he now?

01:07:25.684 --> 01:07:27.761
- He's 20 years old now.

01:07:27.762 --> 01:07:29.086
- Oh, you better watch out.

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:31.081
I might like him more than I like you.

01:07:31.082 --> 01:07:33.003
- Yeah, you're gross.

01:07:33.004 --> 01:07:35.999
- Look, I gotta go, I'll talk to ya later.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.650
- Okay, bye-

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.559
- Oh, they're here.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.560
Hey, you.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.640
- Hola.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.479
- Hola.

01:08:17.481 --> 01:08:18.322
- How you doin'?
- Hey.

01:08:18.323 --> 01:08:19.763
- Good to see you.
- You too.

01:08:19.764 --> 01:08:21.724
- How's it going?
- Thank you, how are you?

01:08:21.725 --> 01:08:22.923
- Great, yeah.

01:08:22.924 --> 01:08:24.158
- Nice to see you.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.118
- Hey, hi.
- Good to see you again.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.121
How was your flight?

01:08:27.122 --> 01:08:28.121
- Yeah, it was very good.

01:08:28.122 --> 01:08:29.519
So, photographs.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.568
- Look, it's just up the hill.
- What about them?

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.211
- Yes, I'm
gonna have them there.

01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:40.247
Yep.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.999
- These are about two
sizes too big, my shoes.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.401
- Yeah, well, this is really painful.

01:08:48.402 --> 01:08:51.279
I don't know how anyone
could fight in this stuff.

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:52.439
- You look-

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:53.679
- What shoes size did you give them.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.648
- The size that you sent me over.

01:08:55.649 --> 01:08:59.279
- I wear a seven, these
feel like a 10 or an 11.

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:01.600
- You've only got to
wear them for a minute, so...

01:09:01.602 --> 01:09:02.759
All right, Steve.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.279
- So, you guys ready?

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:07.404
- We could've got changed,
uh, up here, not down there.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.121
- I can push you up.

01:09:10.122 --> 01:09:11.531
- One, two, three.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.839
Okay.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.760
- I can give you a push.

01:09:14.761 --> 01:09:15.600
- If you need
I can give you a hand.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.250
- No, I don't need any
help, I've done it before.

01:09:17.251 --> 01:09:20.238
One, two, three.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.999
- Yay, Coogs.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.399
- It's just about
getting the timing right.

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:25.399
Okay.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.163
- There's no saddle.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:30.959
Hang on.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.800
Okay, do it quickly now.

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:32.767
- They lick their own asses.

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:35.479
Uh-oh.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:38.845
Take the picture.

01:09:38.845 --> 01:09:39.680
- Just take the picture.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.408
Just take the picture.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.524
What's she doing there,
is she on the internet?

01:09:44.926 --> 01:09:45.966
Just take the picture!

01:09:45.968 --> 01:09:48.599
- Yes, I'm coming, Rob.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.090
- All right, guys.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.399
- Don Quixote had three trips, I think.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.084
He had the one that he
went out on his own.

01:10:02.085 --> 01:10:04.763
And he went back, and he
just did Sancho Panza.

01:10:04.764 --> 01:10:07.922
And then he had the sequel, and
this is now your third trip.

01:10:07.923 --> 01:10:09.410
- When Cervantes wrote the sequel,

01:10:09.411 --> 01:10:13.039
in the interim, after he'd
written the first part,

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.439
there was a fake sequel published,

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.519
then he incorporated the fake
sequel into his real sequel,

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.079
so he made that part of the story.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.162
So when he's out, was on his
travels in the second book,

01:10:23.163 --> 01:10:25.843
he bumps into people who'd
read the fake sequel,

01:10:25.844 --> 01:10:28.923
and so he can slag it off
within the pages as Don Quixote.

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:33.759
That is so bold and innovative,
and it's 500 years ago.

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.239
So, effectively he was postmodern,

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.049
before there was any
modern to be post about.

01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:39.405
- Amazing.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.679
- Cervantes, of course, when he was 37,

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.359
he married a 19-year-old.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.845
- Impressive for a man with one arm.

01:10:51.846 --> 01:10:53.405
- 30 years ago, when I came to Spain,

01:10:53.406 --> 01:10:56.399
I was 18 years old, and I was
pursuing a 37-year-old woman.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.641
- She was 37, so the reverse.
- The reverse, the reverse.

01:10:58.642 --> 01:11:01.366
- I wasn't doing that kind of
cliche with a younger woman.

01:11:01.367 --> 01:11:04.284
- No, absolutely not.
- She was older than me.

01:11:04.285 --> 01:11:07.799
- Would you now be with
a woman 20 years older?

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.041
- Well, I don't, that's, I
think that that's, that's...

01:11:10.042 --> 01:11:11.439
- I'll ask again.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.679
Would you now be with a woman 20,

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.125
a 70-year-old?
- - Honestly that's academic.

01:11:15.126 --> 01:11:16.639
That's academic.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.119
- She could be in any
profession, it doesn't matter.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.484
- He imagined that the inns
were castles, didn't he?

01:11:24.485 --> 01:11:26.003
- In his imagination.
- Indeed.

01:11:26.004 --> 01:11:27.639
- We've been staying in inns.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.563
- Well, we've been literally
staying in castles.

01:11:29.564 --> 01:11:30.799
- Sorry, we have, yeah.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.323
We've been staying in
castles, I think they're inns.

01:11:32.324 --> 01:11:33.890
He stayed in inns, but he
thought they were castles,

01:11:33.891 --> 01:11:35.519
so it's, uh, like, uh...

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.204
- The other way around.
- Circle in a spiral.

01:11:37.205 --> 01:11:39.361
- Like a wheel within a wheel.
- Yes.

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:42.039
- Never ending or beginning
on an ever-spinning reel.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:42.882
- Yeah.

01:11:42.883 --> 01:11:45.039
- Like the circles that you find

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:48.399
in the h-windmills of your mind.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.845
- H-windmills.
- H-windmills.

01:11:49.846 --> 01:11:52.839
- That could be a postmodern manifesto.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.599
- It really could.
- Or a lovely song

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.600
from the '70s.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.202
- Spanish Fly, Rob
Brydon, Steve Coogan.

01:12:24.203 --> 01:12:25.599
Wonderful stuff from them.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.965
Now don't forget come along
with us this morning...

01:12:26.966 --> 01:12:29.042
- Let me just interrupt you there,

01:12:29.043 --> 01:12:31.119
Old Kineebles, me old friend.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:31.962
- Ah.

01:12:31.963 --> 01:12:34.611
- Because anyone who is anyone will know

01:12:34.612 --> 01:12:37.968
that the title of the song by Herb Albert

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.799
is Spanish Flea, not Spanish Fly.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.770
- May I be so bold as to
put you up on a wee point,

01:12:44.771 --> 01:12:49.759
that it's not Herb Albert,
it's Herb Alpert, with a P.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.199
- Ah, yes.
- You've got your Ps

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.247
and your Bs mixed up there.

01:12:52.248 --> 01:12:54.359
- You've got your fleas
and your flies all over.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.519
- And you've got your
- And I've got me

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.646
- Ps and our Bs.
- Ps and me Bs.

01:12:56.647 --> 01:12:58.759
I threw you a little
bone with a mistake there

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.205
so that you could pick
me up, so we're all,

01:13:00.206 --> 01:13:01.919
so we're all Even Steven.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.439
- Although we'll probably never know

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.248
if that was the truth, though, will we?

01:13:04.249 --> 01:13:06.239
- I mean, that...
- Bs, flies, Ps, Bs.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.399
- You put a P in the wrong place.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.811
I had a pee in the wrong place once.

01:13:08.812 --> 01:13:10.844
They won't let me back in
that supermarket again.

01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:12.884
- Yes, and don't forget that you know

01:13:12.885 --> 01:13:14.291
time flies like an arrow,

01:13:14.292 --> 01:13:16.726
but fruit flies like a banana.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.759
- This is beautiful, very calming.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.399
- Yeah.
- It's wonderful.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.242
It's interesting, isn't it?

01:13:41.243 --> 01:13:45.239
We started in the birthplace
of King Ferdinand,

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.479
and here we are at the place
where they were buried.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.322
- Here?

01:13:50.323 --> 01:13:51.999
- Yeah, in the hotel.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.284
- It wasn't a hotel then, though.

01:13:53.285 --> 01:13:54.725
- No it wasn't then.
- That'd be awful wouldn't it?

01:13:54.726 --> 01:13:55.759
Dreadful.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.250
You have a reservation.

01:13:57.251 --> 01:13:58.519
Uh, Smith.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.839
- Corpses of.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.886
- You wait a moment please,
we are about to bury the king.

01:14:01.887 --> 01:14:02.722
Please, what?

01:14:02.723 --> 01:14:04.679
Yes, we have a gymnasium.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.569
- Why are they buried in Granada then.

01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:10.959
- Because this is the last
town to fall to the Catholics.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.599
That's why they call them
the Catholic king and queen.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.807
The thing about the Moors is
they were way more tolerant

01:14:16.808 --> 01:14:18.445
than the Catholics that came after them.

01:14:18.446 --> 01:14:20.044
- I'm a big fan of the Moors.

01:14:20.045 --> 01:14:23.931
Oh, Dudley Moore, Christy
Moore, Patrick Moore?

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.039
- No more, please.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.399
- Roger Moore.
- No.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.399
- Now when I think back to
the Moors being here in Spain,

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.839
I can honestly say we
had a wonderful time.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.759
Mother booked a holiday, and we arrived,

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.719
and found the hotel to be to our liking.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.924
- Of course, what you're
forgetting to point out

01:14:44.925 --> 01:14:47.764
is that the Moors, when
they conquered Spain

01:14:47.765 --> 01:14:51.479
in the early 8th century,
were encountering a Europe

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.801
that was still very much in the Dark Ages.

01:14:53.802 --> 01:14:55.759
- It was pitch black.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.725
- But they of course build
beautiful palaces like this.

01:14:58.726 --> 01:15:00.285
They were very ahead of their time.

01:15:00.286 --> 01:15:03.409
- I have to tell you, when we
were building these palaces,

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:06.959
my fellow Moores, mother,
father, and sister,

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.201
sometimes we would encounter a workman

01:15:09.202 --> 01:15:13.559
who perhaps wasn't working quite
as quickly as I would want.

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.359
Then I would say to him...

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.486
- Move!
- Move!

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.365
- Move!
- Move!

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.086
A lot of them thought
they were hearing cows.

01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:26.039
- The thing about doing Roger Moore.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:26.848
Yes?

01:15:26.849 --> 01:15:28.799
- Less is more.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.642
- Ah, you've met my brother Les.

01:15:30.643 --> 01:15:32.242
- If you can let him...
- Les, come in.

01:15:32.243 --> 01:15:34.284
That's right, I'm also a Moore.

01:15:34.285 --> 01:15:36.085
- Les Moore.
- I was trying to hint

01:15:36.086 --> 01:15:39.562
that you should always leave
your audience wanting more.

01:15:39.563 --> 01:15:42.239
- My audience constantly wants more

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.879
and that's what I give them.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.199
Roger Moore.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.519
- Moore, quit while you're ahead.

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.409
- They introduced the orange to Spain.

01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:53.359
- The Moors?
- Yeah.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.759
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.727
- From where?

01:15:55.728 --> 01:15:58.079
- I guess Morocco, that's
where they're originally from.

01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.241
- Right.
- I can explain it to you,

01:15:59.242 --> 01:16:00.523
if you like, it was my mother.

01:16:00.524 --> 01:16:02.639
She packed one into her hand luggage.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.801
- He didn't get the hint, did he?

01:16:03.802 --> 01:16:06.079
- No.
- On one of her holidays.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.081
To which I said, Mother,
what are you doing?

01:16:08.082 --> 01:16:09.161
She said, shush, Roger,

01:16:09.162 --> 01:16:11.639
I'm going to introduce
the orange to Spain.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.402
- And another thing the Moors introduced

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:15.679
was, of course, our numerical system.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.569
- That's right, we brought
a calculator with us.

01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:19.961
- Because basically we
used to use Roman numerals,

01:16:19.962 --> 01:16:21.286
and it was only when they brought

01:16:21.287 --> 01:16:24.011
the Arabic numerical
system that developed that

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:27.209
into the numerical system we use today.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.879
- Mother said it would never work.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.211
- This is really crazy.
- Father said it will.

01:16:33.212 --> 01:16:36.599
- The fact is that the Moors
were far more sophisticated.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.442
- Yes.
- They knew about medicine,

01:16:37.443 --> 01:16:40.759
- philosophy, mathematics.
- Yes, correct.

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.841
- Astronomy.
- We love looking at the stars

01:16:42.842 --> 01:16:45.127
- Very, very, way more advanced than,

01:16:45.128 --> 01:16:47.479
and also managed to marry.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.444
- My parents did marry,
you're quite right.

01:16:49.445 --> 01:16:50.759
They married at a young age,

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.602
they had me and my sister.

01:16:51.603 --> 01:16:53.409
- Rob, Rob, seriously.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.365
He's got, like, Tourette.

01:16:56.366 --> 01:16:59.842
- The wonderful day my uncle
Bertie gave the sermon,

01:16:59.843 --> 01:17:02.519
he was a preacher, you see.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.362
- The Greek philosophers were translated

01:17:04.363 --> 01:17:06.679
- into Arabic by the Moors.
- That's right.

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.886
- It was only
- Thank you very much.

01:17:07.887 --> 01:17:09.039
- During the Crusades,

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.644
- when they invaded Toledo...
- It was a pleasure to do it.

01:17:10.645 --> 01:17:12.483
And father, sitting at his desk,

01:17:12.484 --> 01:17:14.639
translating night and clay.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.958
My mother would say to him,
- So they translated

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:16.961
- Aristotle's
- when are you going to take

01:17:16.962 --> 01:17:18.323
- Roger to the park?
- teachings.

01:17:18.324 --> 01:17:20.923
- Aristotle's teachings
were translated into Arabic

01:17:20.924 --> 01:17:24.239
by the Muslims, and then during
the Crusades the canvas...

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.004
- Why didn't you say they
were clone by the Moors?

01:17:26.005 --> 01:17:27.570
Are you trying to discourage me?

01:17:27.571 --> 01:17:28.799
- What, what?

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.839
- Please, yes.

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.044
- You've stopped saying Moores,

01:17:31.045 --> 01:17:32.326
and you've started saying Muslims.

01:17:32.327 --> 01:17:36.759
And I find that a little
racially offensive.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.039
- Go on, please.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.201
- You started off referring
to us as the Moores,

01:17:40.202 --> 01:17:42.122
now you're referring to us as Muslims.

01:17:42.123 --> 01:17:43.526
- The Moors were Muslims.

01:17:43.527 --> 01:17:45.679
- But why did you start with Moores?

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:46.486
- It doesn't matter.

01:17:46.487 --> 01:17:47.845
The people that I'm talking
about were one and the same

01:17:47.846 --> 01:17:48.921
Moors with the Muslims.

01:17:48.922 --> 01:17:52.559
- I'm not Roger Muslim, I'm Roger Moore.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.239
- Dear god.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.679
Oh, dear.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.205
Oh, I've got you a ticket the first thing

01:17:57.206 --> 01:17:58.606
in the morning to see the Alhambra.

01:17:58.607 --> 01:18:00.399
- Oh, brilliant, great, great.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.561
- Rob, I've got one for you, too.

01:18:01.562 --> 01:18:04.206
- Can I go later, can
I go after breakfast?

01:18:04.207 --> 01:18:05.611
- It'll be busy.

01:18:05.612 --> 01:18:07.959
- Yolanda, you should come with me.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.039
- I can't, I have to take an
early flight back to London.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:11.848
- Really?

01:18:11.849 --> 01:18:12.919
That's a shame.

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.199
- Leaving me alone with him?

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.441
- Oh, you won't be alone, I'm
coming with you to Malaga.

01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:19.330
I'm gonna make sure
Joe gets to you safely.

01:18:19.331 --> 01:18:21.322
- Thank the Lord.
- Great.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.199
- Hello.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.439
- Hey, hey, Dad.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.319
- Hey, how you doin'?

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.083
- Um, yeah,
I'm good, how are you?

01:18:37.084 --> 01:18:39.481
- Great, really looking
forward to seeing you

01:18:39.482 --> 01:18:40.639
<i>'m Maya de Marc.</i>

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.479
I've missed you, buddy.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.927
- Uh, yeah, that was what I
was calling about actually.

01:18:45.928 --> 01:18:49.039
- Yeah, Emma's, she's
been in touch, right?

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.690
She said she's organized all the flights

01:18:50.691 --> 01:18:52.919
and what have you, so...

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.126
- I can't come.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.399
- What are you talking about?

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.559
- I just can't come.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.131
I need to stay here with Helen.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.040
- What's going on?

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:06.041
Talk to me.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.325
- She's pregnant.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.439
- You're fucking kidding me.

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.839
- She's, she's pregnant.
- You fucking idiot.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.959
- I need to stay here with her

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.644
so we can figure out
what we're going to do.

01:19:22.645 --> 01:19:25.482
- Wait, wait, are you
certain she's pregnant?

01:19:25.483 --> 01:19:27.005
- Yes, she's definitely pregnant.

01:19:27.006 --> 01:19:29.919
- And are you sure it's yours?

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.039
- Dad.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.040
- Um.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.560
Um.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.561
You're 20 years old, you're
too young to have a kid.

01:19:40.562 --> 01:19:42.688
You know, it's, any decisions you make now

01:19:42.689 --> 01:19:47.079
will have ramifications
for the rest of your life.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.279
- Yes, I know, but I'm not just

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.281
making decisions for me anymore.

01:19:51.282 --> 01:19:52.723
I need to think about her,

01:19:52.724 --> 01:19:54.848
and we need to think
about what we're gonna do.

01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.119
- Okay.
- Sorry.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.919
- Listen, you don't
have to be sorry, okay?

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:06.559
It's okay, doesn't matter
about comin' out here.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:10.399
Just, um, well, whatever
happens, I'm here for you.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.365
All right?

01:20:11.366 --> 01:20:12.202
- Thanks, Dad.

01:20:12.203 --> 01:20:13.839
- And I love you.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.319
- Love you, too.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.049
- Okay, listen, um...

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:24.919
Don't worry about it, all right?

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.999
- Yeah.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.844
- I love ya, and I'll
talk to you later, okay?

01:20:28.845 --> 01:20:30.039
- Love you too.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.600
- Got this.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.403
- Hey, good morning.

01:21:22.404 --> 01:21:24.209
- Buenos diaz, amigo, Coogan.

01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:27.039
- How was the Alhambra.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.479
- It was, uh, good, it was good,

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.450
but it was, uh, you know, beautiful,

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.479
spiritual, blah, blah, blah.

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.480
- You okay?

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.039
- Joe's not coming out.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.679
- What, why?

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:44.639
- Uh, his girlfriend's pregnant.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:45.687
- Oh, my god.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.360
- Bloody hell.

01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:49.202
- What's he gonna do?

01:21:49.203 --> 01:21:51.646
- Well, I told him he had options.

01:21:51.647 --> 01:21:53.239
- What does that mean?

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.241
- Well, he's too young to be a clad.

01:21:55.242 --> 01:21:57.049
He's not very worldly, you know.

01:21:57.050 --> 01:22:00.719
- You know what this means, don't you?

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.519
♪ Granddad, Granddad

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.602
♪ We love you
- Hadn't thought of that.

01:22:05.603 --> 01:22:09.730
- I'd start to think about it.

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.479
- He's gonna be a granddad.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.239
- Thank you, Lord.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.079
- Look at those, ah.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.443
- See, a lot of
people think they're ugly,

01:22:26.444 --> 01:22:27.362
because they're modern, but I think

01:22:27.363 --> 01:22:30.199
they're beautiful because
they're functional.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.929
Tilting at Turbines,
that's what I should call

01:22:31.930 --> 01:22:34.039
my book about Spain.

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.565
- Good idea.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.282
Oh, look, Maro.

01:22:41.283 --> 01:22:43.408
Isn't that where you were
gonna take Joe snorkeling.

01:22:43.409 --> 01:22:44.919
- Yeah, it was, yeah.

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:47.810
I brought him here as a
baby when I was filming.

01:22:47.811 --> 01:22:49.399
- How old was he?

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.079
- Ah, about six months.

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:51.922
- Aw.

01:22:51.923 --> 01:22:54.599
- You know, we could still
stop, we've got time.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.090
- I'll go snorkeling
with you, if you want.

01:22:56.091 --> 01:22:57.359
I could be Joe.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.601
- You dressed in a nappy,
crawling out on the beach,

01:22:59.602 --> 01:23:03.039
eating sand, only has limited appeal.

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.246
- Well, it wouldn't be for everyone,

01:23:04.247 --> 01:23:05.763
I mean, I'm the first to admit.

01:23:05.764 --> 01:23:06.966
- No, it was a long time ago,

01:23:06.967 --> 01:23:10.559
when I was still married to his mom.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.560
Yeah.

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.849
- Do you know who lives in Malaga?

01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:44.719
- The mayor of Malaga.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.799
- Yes, correct.
- Thank you.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.079
- And Sean Connery.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.239
- Marbella, Mr. Coogan, Marbella,

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.730
your mate, the mister,
he lives in Marbella.

01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:54.451
- Yeah, but he flies into Malaga.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.479
- By all accounts he's
a very well-respected

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.359
pillar of this society.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:05.719
- Yes, he's very active in civic duties.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.719
- I like to get involved.

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.449
The recycling, for example,

01:24:09.450 --> 01:24:13.919
plastics on a Friday,
cardboard on a Saturday.

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.602
- Do you expect me to talk?

01:24:15.603 --> 01:24:17.728
No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.839
- When he met Cubby
Broccoli and Harry Saltzman

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.566
to discuss the role,
as he left the meeting,

01:24:29.567 --> 01:24:31.324
they looked out of the window,

01:24:31.325 --> 01:24:35.919
and said he, not yet, and
said, what are you doing?

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.127
- Getting ready to do Sean Connery.

01:24:38.128 --> 01:24:41.279
- You appear to be doing him already.

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.324
As he left the building

01:24:42.325 --> 01:24:44.242
and he walked out across Regent Street

01:24:44.243 --> 01:24:46.806
they looked down and
said, "That man is Bond.

01:24:46.807 --> 01:24:48.359
"He moves like a panther."

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.360
- Like a panther.

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.566
- Yes, but walking like
a panther is not enough

01:24:52.567 --> 01:24:55.119
to bag you the role of James Bond.

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.079
Because of course Bond is
also something of a bulldog.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:24:59.965
So, there was...

01:24:59.966 --> 01:25:02.088
- It was primarily he had to
- He had to be a combination

01:25:02.089 --> 01:25:05.242
- walk like a panther.
- Of a panther and a bulldog.

01:25:05.243 --> 01:25:06.651
Apologies if I've been dragging

01:25:06.652 --> 01:25:10.639
my arse 'round the carpet
because I may have worms.

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.079
- I have a very itchy
anus, I apologize now,

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.366
but it's part and parcel
- Show your bloody itchy anus.

01:25:14.367 --> 01:25:16.245
- Of being a panther at the clock.

01:25:16.246 --> 01:25:17.885
- When you introduce me to Blofeld,

01:25:17.886 --> 01:25:20.611
perhaps I should curl
up and lick my balls.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.121
I think I make quite a
good knight, don't I?

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:30.084
- Yeah.
- You do actually, yeah.

01:25:30.085 --> 01:25:32.763
With the best one in the world
you could never be El Cid.

01:25:32.764 --> 01:25:34.569
You could be a chap called Sid,

01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:35.839
just not El Cid.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.043
- I could be Old Cid.

01:25:37.044 --> 01:25:39.039
- Yeah, Old El Cid.
- You could be Old Cid.

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.201
Look me in the eye and tell me

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:42.085
you think you could play El Cid.

01:25:42.086 --> 01:25:44.081
In a remake, the Charlton Heston role.

01:25:44.082 --> 01:25:45.443
- I mean, you could certainly play

01:25:45.444 --> 01:25:46.879
Michael Hordern in El Cid.

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.720
- Who did he play?

01:25:47.721 --> 01:25:48.959
- Someone's clad, I can't remember.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.039
- Oh.

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.246
You know Michael Hordern, Emma?

01:25:51.247 --> 01:25:52.519
- Michael Hordern, yuh.

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.405
- Why is she having him?

01:25:53.406 --> 01:25:54.242
- Michael Hordern would go,

01:25:54.243 --> 01:25:56.559
yuh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-um,
Paddington Bear.

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.400
- Yeah, I know.

01:25:57.401 --> 01:25:58.561
- I loved his voice.
- That wasn't Michael Hordern.

01:25:58.562 --> 01:26:00.050
That was Michael Hordern's horse.

01:26:00.051 --> 01:26:01.959
- Michael, hmm, Hordern.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:02.802
Anyway, hm?

01:26:02.803 --> 01:26:05.039
- Didn't he do No Man's Land with Gielgud.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.563
You wouldn't know, it
was theater, but he did.

01:26:06.564 --> 01:26:07.402
- Um.
- Did he?

01:26:07.403 --> 01:26:09.289
- You know who's doing it now?

01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:12.119
Ian McKellen, you shall not have the ring.

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.679
- Ian McKellen, speaks
like that with a slight,

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.399
however he fancies northern flat vowels.

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:19.799
- Yes, gracias.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:20.839
- Finito.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.205
- Muchas gracias.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.679
Thank you.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.648
- You're missing a bit of
confidence, you see, because Ian...

01:26:26.649 --> 01:26:29.004
- Yes, well, no, I think
you're overplaying that

01:26:29.005 --> 01:26:30.159
because, you see...

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.650
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, he's acting in the role.

01:26:31.651 --> 01:26:33.083
You don't quite get it.

01:26:33.084 --> 01:26:34.999
- I've spoken to him.
- I can speak.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.841
- Oh, you do a McKelloff.
- I have actually met him.

01:26:36.842 --> 01:26:38.729
- I have met him many times.
- I've met him many times.

01:26:38.730 --> 01:26:40.484
- How many times?
- Many times.

01:26:40.485 --> 01:26:45.079
Oh, you don't get the
musicality when he throws a line

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.241
up to the gods,
- That was good.

01:26:46.242 --> 01:26:47.526
- And then brings it back down,

01:26:47.527 --> 01:26:49.919
but still with the flat vowels.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.762
They are very much in evidence,

01:26:51.763 --> 01:26:53.724
however much he may try to be,

01:26:53.725 --> 01:26:56.121
pursue pronunciation with the vowels.

01:26:56.122 --> 01:26:57.804
- Oh, you do make me laugh, you really,

01:26:57.805 --> 01:26:59.319
you do make me laugh.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.399
Oh, we need a laugh, don't we?

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.839
Oh, you do make me laugh, Rob, you do.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.763
- That's what he said to me.
- He do that more in private?

01:27:05.764 --> 01:27:07.125
- Because when he met me, he said,

01:27:07.126 --> 01:27:09.079
"You're a very good actor."

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.599
- Ah.
- Ooh, yum.

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.879
- Enjoy.-

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.039
- You asked for this.
- I did ask for this.

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:25.039
Do you want to come back with me?

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.121
I can get you on the same flight.

01:27:26.122 --> 01:27:27.639
- No, I'll stay, thank you,

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.130
and I'm gonna write
more and finish my book.

01:27:29.131 --> 01:27:33.011
- I think the word you're
looking for is start.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.079
Thinkin' about Joe.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.799
20 is a young age to have a child.

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.402
- How old were you when you had your kids?

01:27:41.403 --> 01:27:42.403
- 43.

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.042
- Bit of a difference.

01:27:44.043 --> 01:27:45.199
- Yes.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.085
I didn't drink 'til I was 35,

01:27:47.086 --> 01:27:48.603
and the first child at 43.

01:27:48.604 --> 01:27:49.761
Are the two related?

01:27:49.762 --> 01:27:50.804
We'll never know.

01:27:50.805 --> 01:27:53.326
- How old, what's her
name, the girlfriend?

01:27:53.327 --> 01:27:54.719
- Helen, she's 19.

01:27:55.561 --> 01:27:56.561
- 19?
- Gosh.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.290
- Only 19 years old.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.839
- She was only 19 years old!

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.490
- I don't mean any
disrespect, Steve, but...

01:28:06.491 --> 01:28:08.879
- She was only 19, she was only,

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:09.800
you've got to get the voice better.

01:28:09.801 --> 01:28:11.928
- Well, you've got me most in
your voice when you say it.

01:28:11.929 --> 01:28:13.445
- She was only.
- Now he has.

01:28:13.446 --> 01:28:15.039
- She was 19 years old.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.959
- Joe has met a young lady.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.247
- She was only 19 years old.

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.119
- When Joe and Helen had a child

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.399
she was only 19 years old.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.519
- She was only, it's
actually 16 in the film.

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:33.799
- I know that, but Helen
was only 19 years old.

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.525
And she had the child with Joe.

01:28:35.526 --> 01:28:37.887
She had a grandfather who was so talented,

01:28:37.888 --> 01:28:39.799
who was so gifted.

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.722
- He was only.

01:28:40.723 --> 01:28:42.961
- The grandfather was only 50 years old.

01:28:42.962 --> 01:28:44.919
- 50 years old.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.002
Hey, do you know who was born in Malaga?

01:28:47.003 --> 01:28:48.479
- No.
- Picasso.

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.959
- Who?
- Picasso.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:50.802
- Is that true?

01:28:50.803 --> 01:28:53.243
- Yeah, they're openin' a museum to him.

01:28:53.244 --> 01:28:55.359
- Who played Picasso
in a very popular film

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:56.325
- in the last 10 years?
- Oh, god.

01:28:56.326 --> 01:28:57.160
- Who was it?

01:28:57.161 --> 01:28:58.002
No, ask Emma.

01:28:58.003 --> 01:28:59.799
- Who played Picasso?

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:01.801
Guess, it's one of Rob's five impressions.

01:29:01.802 --> 01:29:03.562
That should narrow it down.

01:29:03.563 --> 01:29:05.279
- It wasn't Tom Jones.
- Antonio?

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.598
- No, not allowed.
- It wasn't Tom Jones.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.440
Okay, we're gettin' closer.

01:29:07.441 --> 01:29:09.010
- We're gettin' warmer.
- Spanish, Spanish.

01:29:09.012 --> 01:29:09.967
- I don't know.
- Tony Hopkins.

01:29:09.968 --> 01:29:11.759
Tony Hopkins played in Surviving...

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:12.759
- Did he?

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:15.885
- Surviving Picasso, I played
the painter, wonderful man.

01:29:15.886 --> 01:29:17.084
I don't like to talk about it.

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:17.922
I like to draw.

01:29:17.923 --> 01:29:20.119
I like to put the eyes
here, the nose there,

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.087
- the mouth up there.
- He played Picasso

01:29:21.088 --> 01:29:22.399
as a Welshman?

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.079
- Well, he didn't do a
Spanish accent, Steve.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:25.920
- Did he not?

01:29:25.921 --> 01:29:27.729
- He doesn't have your
versatility, let's be honest.

01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:30.799
- He learned to paint, and
he painted the paintings

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.608
in a fiddlety way.

01:29:31.609 --> 01:29:34.166
He knew how to instill life,
and he knew how to, uh,

01:29:34.167 --> 01:29:35.965
you know, paint, uh, the way these as...

01:29:35.966 --> 01:29:37.004
- Uh, Pablo, Pablo.

01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:39.321
Some of the men are saying
that you're painting

01:29:39.322 --> 01:29:40.523
in a very strange way.

01:29:40.524 --> 01:29:42.999
They're saying that the nose
is where the eyes should be.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.759
Some of them are saying you're a Cubist.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.602
- Oh, Pablo?

01:29:45.603 --> 01:29:47.999
Is it not captain or sir, hm, eh?

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:48.840
- There are rumblings, Pablo.

01:29:48.841 --> 01:29:50.444
- Oh, they want me to put the
nose in the front of the face.

01:29:50.445 --> 01:29:51.959
In the middle, like that, that it?

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.722
And the eyes next to the
nose, is that what you want?

01:29:53.723 --> 01:29:54.846
- Yes, sir.
- Well, tell the men,

01:29:54.847 --> 01:29:57.283
when we put the nose by the cheekies,

01:29:57.284 --> 01:29:58.599
and we put the eyes up here,

01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.724
and the mouth 'round the corner,

01:29:59.725 --> 01:30:01.210
I was asail 'round the Cape of Good Hope,

01:30:01.212 --> 01:30:02.042
goddam your eyes, sir.

01:30:02.043 --> 01:30:03.519
- I put the eyes where I want to,

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.644
and the nose where I want to.

01:30:04.645 --> 01:30:05.721
If you turn your back on me,

01:30:05.722 --> 01:30:07.365
I shall put two eyes on your back,

01:30:07.366 --> 01:30:08.879
and a nose down by your ass.

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:09.686
Do you want that, sir?

01:30:09.687 --> 01:30:10.520
Is that what you want, sir?

01:30:10.521 --> 01:30:11.601
Don't turn your back on me.

01:30:11.602 --> 01:30:14.039
I will draw you like a
Cubist, that's what I'll do.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:14.962
If you turn your back on me,

01:30:14.963 --> 01:30:16.802
I'll put a nose on your bottom, sir.

01:30:16.803 --> 01:30:18.126
'Round the Horn is a good way,

01:30:18.127 --> 01:30:19.279
'round the Horn we shall go.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.964
- The most interesting
thing about Picasso is,

01:30:20.965 --> 01:30:23.201
why I love him, his early paintings

01:30:23.202 --> 01:30:26.519
are very orthodox, very accessible.

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.727
He knew how to do all that,
but he said that's not enough.

01:30:28.728 --> 01:30:30.684
I want to rewrite the rule book,

01:30:30.685 --> 01:30:32.405
and be radical and Avant Garde.

01:30:32.406 --> 01:30:34.641
- Are you a bit like Picasso, Steve?

01:30:34.642 --> 01:30:36.563
- Well, I empathize with what he did.

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:38.559
- Yes, he is, he is, he is.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.879
He's gonna say it.

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:40.688
- What I'm saying is...

01:30:40.689 --> 01:30:44.401
- Let me record
this, hang on, hang on.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.842
- I've got a reservations, Steve Coogan.

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:02.639
- This castle is Gibralfaro,

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:05.041
named after the same man as Gibraltar.

01:31:05.042 --> 01:31:08.601
When the Moors came in 711,
they were only a few thousand.

01:31:08.602 --> 01:31:10.728
Within a couple of years they controlled

01:31:10.729 --> 01:31:13.079
almost all of Spain.

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.682
- Wow.
- That's exactly the same

01:31:14.683 --> 01:31:16.839
as ISIS and the modern caliphate,

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:18.365
because there's only a
few thousand of them,

01:31:18.366 --> 01:31:21.245
and yet they control half
of Syria and half of Iraq.

01:31:21.246 --> 01:31:23.082
They're trying to emulate
what the Moors did

01:31:23.083 --> 01:31:26.239
when they had control everywhere
from Cordoba to Baghdad.

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.205
- Well, ISIS aren't tolerant.

01:31:27.206 --> 01:31:28.326
They're not doing it with tolerance and...

01:31:28.327 --> 01:31:30.879
- No, they're not, but Islam, uh, is...

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.961
- Can we stop talking about ISIS?

01:31:32.962 --> 01:31:35.361
- Cervantes was captured
by Barbary pirates

01:31:35.362 --> 01:31:37.159
and taken to Algiers.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:39.683
There was a price on his head,
and when the ransom was paid,

01:31:39.684 --> 01:31:41.759
he let his brother go instead of him.

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:42.805
- Very noble.
- Is that true?

01:31:42.806 --> 01:31:43.640
- That is true.

01:31:43.641 --> 01:31:44.562
- He let his brother go,

01:31:44.563 --> 01:31:46.210
- when he could have gone.
- Yeah.

01:31:46.211 --> 01:31:48.039
- Wow.
- I know.

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:48.880
- Not sure I'd do that.

01:31:48.881 --> 01:31:50.291
Would you do that, let your brother go?

01:31:50.292 --> 01:31:52.599
- Uh, probably not.

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:53.761
- No, I don't think I would either,

01:31:53.762 --> 01:31:55.879
with the best one in the world.

01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:56.722
- No.

01:31:56.723 --> 01:31:58.764
If my child we there,
they could take my child.

01:31:58.765 --> 01:31:59.999
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.490
- I'd let any child go.

01:32:01.491 --> 01:32:02.999
- Any child?

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.125
- Any child, as long as it, you
know, I mean, not any child.

01:32:06.126 --> 01:32:08.441
I mean, it has to be worth the effort.

01:32:08.442 --> 01:32:11.799
- Cervantes, when he tried
to escape, he's captured,

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:12.961
he had a noose around his neck.

01:32:12.962 --> 01:32:15.122
He was talking to Hassan,
the leader of Algiers,

01:32:15.123 --> 01:32:18.879
and he became his lover to
literally save his neck.

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:20.199
- Bum or neck?
- Yeah.

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.563
- If that's what it comes down to, yes.

01:32:21.564 --> 01:32:22.402
- Life or bum.

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:25.439
- Well, either way your buggered.

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.799
- Let me say now, I'm in.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:30.439
- Really?
- He's in, rather, he's in.

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:33.284
- Ah, but they became lovers,
so it would be in-out-in-out.

01:32:33.285 --> 01:32:34.719
- You see that ferry?

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.839
- Yeah.

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:38.161
- That's the ferry for Africa.

01:32:38.162 --> 01:32:39.559
- Really?
- Mm.

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:47.481
It's always good to say
goodbye in the mist.

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.807
Like, uh, end of Casablanca.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.639
- Could be the start of
a beautiful friendship.

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:57.242
- Be the start of a beautiful friendship.

01:32:57.243 --> 01:32:58.080
- Could be the start

01:32:58.081 --> 01:32:59.002
- of a beautiful friendship.
- You gotta get the depth.

01:32:59.003 --> 01:33:01.446
- I got the depth right there.

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.884
- Look at that mystical city.

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.730
- Right, I'm gonna make a move.

01:33:10.731 --> 01:33:12.085
Um, early flight.

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.759
- Yeah, me too, actually.

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:16.727
- <i>Oh, mm.</i>

01:33:16.728 --> 01:33:18.006
- Mm, Oh.

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.845
- We say our goodbyes now.

01:33:20.846 --> 01:33:21.879
- Okay, okay-

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:22.961
- Yeah, sure

01:33:22.962 --> 01:33:26.599
- Yeah, no, so, uh, I'm really

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.485

01:33:27.486 --> 01:33:28.322
- All right, good.

01:33:28.323 --> 01:33:30.039

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.319

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.959

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:39.199

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:47.919
- And we disappear into the mist.

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:52.279
Could be the start of

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:48.966
- Buenos diaz.

01:34:48.967 --> 01:34:49.845

sleeping with him anymore.

01:36:59.206 --> 01:37:02.602
- Look I gotta go, he's
waiting for me downstairs.

01:37:02.603 --> 01:37:06.319
