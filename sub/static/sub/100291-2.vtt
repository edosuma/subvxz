WEBVTT

00:07.214 --> 00:10.354
Two dead.
Michael Connors and his wife Susan.

00:10.394 --> 00:13.861
Michael had one daughter from a
previous wife who died. Annabel.

00:13.901 --> 00:17.180
I reckon you're controlling
the drug flow for this entire area.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.700
It's my mum supplying the drugs.
She's out for revenge.

00:19.741 --> 00:21.500
She wants a war,
she's going to get one.

00:21.541 --> 00:24.700
Why didn't you phone the police?
I know I should have!

00:24.741 --> 00:26.381
Are they considering Annabel?

00:26.420 --> 00:27.860
Nothing points to her.

00:27.900 --> 00:31.180
I think there's something
really off about her. That's pretty.

00:31.220 --> 00:33.740
Just some bit of old rubbish.
Had it for years.

00:35.180 --> 00:36.661
Dad let me sleep in his bed.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.540
Any bare skin he could find...

00:38.581 --> 00:41.180
So we've got Joe, Annabel
and a gun all missing?

00:41.220 --> 00:42.740
We're checking out her flat today

00:42.781 --> 00:45.060
and a few other properties
Michael Connors owned.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.861
Size 8. Could be Joe Bancroft's.

00:46.901 --> 00:49.100
I'm sorry, but you can't go round
there, ma'am.

00:49.140 --> 00:51.740
This place is now a crime scene.
I need you out.

00:54.780 --> 00:57.541
At this stage of the investigation,
we're very anxious

00:57.581 --> 00:59.380
to trace Dr Annabel Connors,

00:59.420 --> 01:01.140
'Michael Connors' daughter.

01:01.181 --> 01:03.901
'She was last seen at
the Thistle and Rose Hotel

01:03.941 --> 01:05.459
'with her fiance Joe Bancroft

01:05.501 --> 01:06.981
'on Monday night.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.941
'Anyone with any information
regarding Joe and Annabel

01:09.981 --> 01:11.820
'should contact the police
immediately.

01:11.861 --> 01:13.820
'Do not approach them directly.'

01:13.861 --> 01:17.380
'Are Annabel Connors
and Joe Bancroft suspects?'

01:17.421 --> 01:20.301
'They're key persons of interest
to the investigation.'

01:20.341 --> 01:21.661
'What involvement

01:21.701 --> 01:24.941
'does Detective Chief Superintendent
Bancroft have in the investigation?'

01:24.980 --> 01:28.421
'None. I report directly to
Chief Constable Holland.'

01:31.861 --> 01:33.980
What the hell was that, out there?

01:34.020 --> 01:36.180
Look, you're not across this.
I know what I'm doing.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.941
You could have at least given me
the heads-up before going public.

01:38.980 --> 01:40.421
Why would I? I can't trust you.

01:40.460 --> 01:42.820
You inveigled your way into Annabel
and Joe's flat,

01:42.861 --> 01:44.781
into what turned out to be
a major crime scene.

01:44.820 --> 01:46.301
You put this whole case on the line.

01:46.341 --> 01:49.061
Have you actually got anything
that puts Joe in the Connors house?

01:49.100 --> 01:51.501
Annabel could have been wearing
those trainers,

01:51.540 --> 01:53.221
this whole thing could be a setup!

01:53.260 --> 01:54.540
It's not just the trainers.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.740
The phone company pinged
Joe's work phone.

01:56.781 --> 01:58.941
It was in the vicinity of the
Connors house

01:58.980 --> 01:59.900
the night of the murder.

01:59.941 --> 02:01.221
You wanna help Joe?

02:01.260 --> 02:02.941
Get him a lawyer.

02:02.980 --> 02:04.180
The best you can find.

03:10.540 --> 03:11.901
Get the fu...

03:11.941 --> 03:13.700
What d'you think you're playing at?

03:13.741 --> 03:16.221
I'm fucking sick of you and
Bancroft telling me what to do!

03:16.260 --> 03:18.061
You've got this club,

03:18.100 --> 03:19.461
she gets the glory.

03:19.501 --> 03:21.221
Meanwhile, I'm covering
for both of you.

03:21.260 --> 03:24.341
My mum's onto us! When you come
in here, you need to be discreet.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.420
What I need...

03:28.461 --> 03:29.860
is some more coke.

03:37.461 --> 03:39.860
I'll have some sent to your house.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.501
Get off home.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.580
Did anyone clock who he was?

04:23.621 --> 04:25.021
No, I kicked him straight out.

04:25.061 --> 04:27.221
But he's getting too unpredictable.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.180
Just don't need this right now, I...

04:31.381 --> 04:33.141
If I've got any chance
of protecting Joe,

04:33.180 --> 04:34.821
I've got to keep my position
at work.

04:36.620 --> 04:37.940
I know who threw the acid at you.

04:39.781 --> 04:41.581
He used to work for me.

04:43.060 --> 04:44.180
I want to kill him.

04:46.341 --> 04:48.141
We don't need any more trouble.

04:48.180 --> 04:50.341
Besides, it's your mum
who's the problem.

04:55.221 --> 04:57.620
Do you really think that she'd grass
you out?

04:59.540 --> 05:00.860
No question.

05:03.381 --> 05:05.060
I'm sorry.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.980
Yeah, well...

05:08.021 --> 05:09.661
I got over it.

05:09.701 --> 05:10.940
A long time ago.

05:12.420 --> 05:13.901
Stay at the club tomorrow.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.420
I'll be in touch.

05:52.141 --> 05:54.261
Hello, Elizabeth.

05:58.261 --> 06:00.500
'Anyone with any information
regarding Joe and Annabel

06:00.540 --> 06:02.860
'should contact the police

06:02.901 --> 06:04.581
'Do not approach them directly.'

06:17.021 --> 06:20.860
'I report directly to
Chief Constable Holland.'

06:52.381 --> 06:55.940
Hi. Yes, I think I saw
that young couple on the news.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.100
In the woods near Willowside.

06:59.381 --> 07:00.740
Yes.

07:00.781 --> 07:02.940
Well, I heard them
before I saw them.

07:02.980 --> 07:06.060
They were shooting at birds.
The boy had a gun.

07:13.021 --> 07:14.740
Thank you for letting me stay.

07:14.781 --> 07:18.060
No problem. Though you probably
should have told me you were coming.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.100
If I did, you would have put me off.

07:20.141 --> 07:21.821
No, I wouldn't, Mum.

07:24.540 --> 07:27.620
Um, I was going to ring you
about Joe.

07:27.661 --> 07:29.060
It's just it's been very busy.

07:30.381 --> 07:32.261
It was on the news again
this morning.

07:34.141 --> 07:35.940
He looks so different
in the pictures.

07:36.980 --> 07:39.860
What do the police want him for,
Elizabeth?

07:39.901 --> 07:42.701
I think they just need him to answer
some of their enquiries.

07:42.740 --> 07:44.141
So...

07:44.180 --> 07:47.461
Person of interest? Doesn't that
mean they want to arrest him?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.221
No, not necessarily.
Are you sure?

07:49.261 --> 07:50.940
Look, I'll give you a call

07:50.980 --> 07:52.461
if anything new comes up.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.740
I've got to get to work now
and you should be getting home,

07:54.781 --> 07:55.781
so I'll ring you a cab.

07:55.821 --> 07:58.980
Why did he run away
if he didn't do anything?

07:59.021 --> 08:01.180
Because he's bloody stupid!

08:02.300 --> 08:04.500
And his girlfriend's
a manipulative bitch.

08:04.540 --> 08:06.860
Oh, so you think that
she was the one

08:06.901 --> 08:09.381
that got him into this trouble?
Yes.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.581
Yes, that's what I think.

08:13.060 --> 08:16.341
Great to know you've got faith
in him, Mum. I do. I DO.

08:17.701 --> 08:19.860
I just...
Just what?

08:22.381 --> 08:24.500
What can I do to help?

08:27.860 --> 08:29.781
Honestly, just...

08:29.821 --> 08:33.660
Just go home and let me get on
with this, OK?

08:34.821 --> 08:36.020
Can't I stay?

08:39.341 --> 08:41.780
Please? Just until they find him?

08:53.540 --> 08:54.621
Hey.

08:54.661 --> 08:55.901
Hey...

09:03.300 --> 09:04.661
What are you doing?

09:04.700 --> 09:05.901
What does it look like?

09:05.940 --> 09:07.300
Breakfast!

09:11.180 --> 09:12.981
Where's that come from?

09:13.021 --> 09:14.381
Oh, I found it.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.021
At the bottom of my bag.

09:16.060 --> 09:18.340
I thought we could have some fun,

09:18.381 --> 09:19.820
as it's our last day.

09:38.101 --> 09:39.420
You're late.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.101
Um, change of plan.

09:41.141 --> 09:43.101
We're not going to pick up
Mrs Kamara any more.

09:43.141 --> 09:45.141
We're going to bring Daanish in
instead. Why?

09:45.180 --> 09:48.300
Well, we need to put a bit of
distance between us and Daanish

09:48.340 --> 09:50.501
and, er, you said that Walker
was sniffing about...

09:50.540 --> 09:53.180
Does Daanish know about this? Yeah,
yeah. I spoke to him last night.

09:53.220 --> 09:54.820
Why am I only finding out now?

09:59.021 --> 10:00.340
All right, everybody.

10:00.381 --> 10:02.220
Listen up.

10:03.540 --> 10:05.820
Let's have your attention, please.

10:07.820 --> 10:09.981
Today, this new force...

10:11.901 --> 10:13.180
.. means business.

10:13.220 --> 10:18.501
We've got a lot to do, so I'm going
to need all of your focus, OK?

10:18.540 --> 10:21.060
So what we have is

10:21.101 --> 10:24.901
faces of the drug scene,
past and present. This afternoon,

10:24.940 --> 10:27.101
we turn them over
in simultaneous raids.

10:27.141 --> 10:29.540
I will act as Gold Commander, OK?

10:29.580 --> 10:33.381
Now, I'll come and brief you
individually in your teams, right?

10:33.420 --> 10:36.381
But for now, we go in hard,
we go in fast,

10:36.420 --> 10:37.940
at 4pm today, all right?

10:37.981 --> 10:39.981
Thanks, all. Cheers, Chief.
Lee...

10:48.060 --> 10:50.460
I see Mrs Kamara is no longer
on the board.

10:51.580 --> 10:54.300
But Daanish is.

10:54.340 --> 10:57.300
Why's that?
He's a person of interest.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.940
Like you said, Highwater
was his backyard.

11:00.981 --> 11:02.501
Frances?

11:02.540 --> 11:05.580
I just wanted to talk to you
about Jake Harper.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.901
The press conference he did
on the Connors case,

11:07.940 --> 11:09.460
it was well out of line.

11:09.501 --> 11:11.060
He ran every word of it by me.

11:11.101 --> 11:12.700
Elizabeth,

11:12.741 --> 11:15.300
you can't afford to be sentimental
about family ties.

11:15.340 --> 11:18.101
You need to play things by the book.

11:18.141 --> 11:19.981
We're talking about my son.

11:20.021 --> 11:21.661
There's been a development.

11:22.741 --> 11:26.101
Whatever comes down the line,
don't let it derail you.

11:26.141 --> 11:27.340
Especially today.

11:58.101 --> 11:59.101
Boss?

11:59.141 --> 12:01.381
Is it true there's a lead
on Joe and Annabel?

12:02.661 --> 12:03.861
Where d'you hear that?

12:03.901 --> 12:07.101
Please, just tell me if you're
going to bring them in today.

12:07.141 --> 12:09.340
Honestly, guv,
there's no new leads.

12:09.381 --> 12:11.261
As soon as we find them,
you'll know.

12:16.981 --> 12:18.300
Was that Bancroft?

12:18.340 --> 12:19.621
Yeah.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.381
I know it's hard to lie to her.

12:23.420 --> 12:25.781
But she can't know about
any of this.

12:25.820 --> 12:28.060
Especially if there's a firearm
involved.

12:33.781 --> 12:35.580
I'd like to thank our parents

12:35.621 --> 12:38.700
for fucking us up
so that we could meet!

12:38.741 --> 12:41.501
That's gonna be my wedding speech.
If we ever have a wedding.

12:42.540 --> 12:43.621
I swear we will.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.501
Where will we live?

12:46.540 --> 12:48.420
Fuck knows.
Some fucking mansion somewhere.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.381
And we'll have children!

12:52.420 --> 12:54.101
We'll look after them properly.

12:54.141 --> 12:57.141
We won't do bad things to them
like our parents have done to us.

13:01.261 --> 13:03.820
If I end up in prison...

13:03.861 --> 13:07.661
Then I'll wait for you, however long
it takes. Well, you mustn't.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.220
Cos I won't survive it.

13:10.261 --> 13:11.981
I won't ever come out.

13:14.220 --> 13:15.580
What are you talking about?

13:16.741 --> 13:18.300
Dying wouldn't be that hard.

13:19.621 --> 13:23.300
Sometimes I think my mum's just
waiting for me... Don't say that.

13:23.340 --> 13:26.060
But someone has to pay, Joe.

13:26.101 --> 13:27.420
Not always.

13:30.861 --> 13:34.340
And I won't let you go to prison.
Mm-hm.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.261
Cos I'll do anything to protect you.

13:37.940 --> 13:40.060
Anything.

13:57.145 --> 14:00.226
This is Gold, all units
are in position, standing by.

14:00.265 --> 14:02.905
OK. Unit six, ready to go.

14:07.986 --> 14:10.626
All units strike, strike, strike.

14:10.665 --> 14:12.866
Police! Go, go, go!
Armed police!

14:17.145 --> 14:19.545
Armed police!
Go! Go! Go!

14:28.586 --> 14:30.506
Daanish Kamara, you're under arrest.

14:41.025 --> 14:43.265
Move, come on. Let's go.

15:57.145 --> 15:58.425
Daanish?

16:04.226 --> 16:06.586
I think we need to have
a little talk.

16:08.986 --> 16:10.986
Since the moment you got back,

16:11.025 --> 16:13.626
you've made it impossible
for me to ignore you.

16:16.425 --> 16:17.785
Got my attention.

16:19.265 --> 16:20.905
What is it you want?

16:20.945 --> 16:22.866
I wanted you out of the way.

16:24.265 --> 16:25.466
Since that failed...

16:27.145 --> 16:28.785
.. I could settle for a deal.

16:28.826 --> 16:31.185
These are my terms.

16:32.466 --> 16:33.785
Joe?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.425
I think I heard something outside.

16:35.466 --> 16:37.586
Can you go and have a look?

16:37.626 --> 16:39.265
Please, Joe, now!

16:39.305 --> 16:41.305
OK...
NOW, Joe.

16:48.986 --> 16:50.145
I can't see anything.

16:54.145 --> 16:55.586
Joe Bancroft.

16:55.626 --> 16:58.785
Don't shoot, don't shoot,
don't shoot! Ahh!

16:58.826 --> 17:00.986
Don't shoot!

17:02.025 --> 17:04.506
My name is Detective Superintendent
Jake Harper.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.185
No sudden movements.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.665
Hands behind your head.

17:07.705 --> 17:09.545
I'm going to walk slowly
towards you,

17:09.586 --> 17:10.705
do you understand?

17:11.746 --> 17:13.425
Do you have a firearm
on your person?

17:13.465 --> 17:14.746
No, no.

17:14.785 --> 17:16.944
In the caravan?
No!

17:16.984 --> 17:18.185
There's no gun!

17:18.224 --> 17:20.826
Armed police!

17:22.744 --> 17:23.826
Show me your hands.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.665
Walk towards me.

17:29.425 --> 17:30.905
Face the door.

17:32.066 --> 17:35.145
Joe Bancroft, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murders

17:35.185 --> 17:36.705
of Michael and Susan Connors.

17:36.745 --> 17:39.026
Annabel Connors,
I'm also arresting you

17:39.066 --> 17:42.145
on suspicion of the murders of
Michael and Susan Connors.

17:42.185 --> 17:43.665
No, I haven't done anything!

17:43.705 --> 17:44.985
Joe!

17:45.026 --> 17:46.145
Joe, help me!

17:46.185 --> 17:47.586
Joe!

17:47.626 --> 17:49.386
Please! Help, Joe!

17:49.425 --> 17:50.465
Ow!

17:51.465 --> 17:52.826
I'm innocent!

17:52.866 --> 17:54.826
I haven't done anything!

17:58.425 --> 18:00.066
Sounds interesting.

18:00.106 --> 18:01.145
But...

18:04.465 --> 18:05.786
.. question is,

18:05.826 --> 18:08.505
do I really wanna help you?

18:10.905 --> 18:13.985
I've had acid thrown in my face...

18:15.586 --> 18:17.546
.. you put shit drugs out
on the street...

18:19.066 --> 18:20.306
.. nearly started a gang war...

18:20.346 --> 18:22.745
If there was gonna be a deal,
it would have to be on my terms.

18:24.026 --> 18:25.225
I'm listening.

18:31.465 --> 18:33.306
I don't think you're gonna
like them.

18:58.266 --> 19:00.826
Daanish Kamara's flagged to you
on the system.

19:02.665 --> 19:05.866
You've been running him as an
unregistered informant, haven't you?

19:07.106 --> 19:08.866
But then his mum comes back,

19:08.905 --> 19:10.665
risks your little arrangement

19:10.705 --> 19:12.546
and hey presto, she's dead.

19:12.586 --> 19:15.705
But Daanish, he's got an alibi,

19:15.745 --> 19:18.945
cos YOU brought him in.

19:18.985 --> 19:21.346
I don't have a clue
what you're on about.

19:23.905 --> 19:25.705
Bancroft's got to you.

19:27.665 --> 19:29.905
You're protecting a drug dealer.

19:31.306 --> 19:34.705
You're in this up to your neck, so
when Daanish or Bancroft asks you

19:34.745 --> 19:36.705
to chuck an old lady
out of a window...

19:38.145 --> 19:41.826
.. you can't say no.
I didn't go near her.

19:41.866 --> 19:43.185
Well, if you didn't...

19:44.346 --> 19:45.745
.. and Daanish couldn't...

19:47.905 --> 19:50.106
.. then Bancroft did.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.185
Elizabeth?

20:03.225 --> 20:04.346
Don't go out!

20:04.386 --> 20:05.826
Stay put.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.346
Joe!

20:36.786 --> 20:38.945
I'm getting you a lawyer.
Don't talk to anyone

20:38.985 --> 20:40.786
until she gets here.
I don't need a lawyer.

20:40.826 --> 20:42.985
You said you'd help me.
If I get sent down for this,

20:43.026 --> 20:45.505
I need you to get me out
as quick as possible.

20:45.546 --> 20:47.505
You're not gonna get sent down.
But if I do.

20:48.786 --> 20:50.786
Look, whatever you're thinking,
stop.

20:50.826 --> 20:53.665
You're head of the force, can break
every rule. Doesn't work like that.

20:53.705 --> 20:56.665
You're telling me you haven't broken
rules before? This is different.

20:56.705 --> 20:59.346
If you were using your brains,
you'd know that. Is this Annabel?

20:59.386 --> 21:02.505
Annabel's been through enough shit.
You've got to stop protecting her.

21:02.546 --> 21:05.505
Like I did Katherine? This has
nothing to do with Katherine!

21:05.546 --> 21:06.786
Of course it does.

21:06.826 --> 21:09.866
You don't get that,
then you don't get anything.

21:09.905 --> 21:11.626
It's time you paid.

21:11.665 --> 21:13.185
It's time we both paid.
Joe...

21:13.225 --> 21:15.786
Joe! I wanna talk to someone!

21:15.826 --> 21:18.066
I wanna talk to someone NOW!

21:37.386 --> 21:39.386
Guv! You can't be in here.

21:39.425 --> 21:40.546
Do you wanna keep your job?

21:40.586 --> 21:43.586
Do ya? 'Interview with Joe Bancroft,
conducted by DSI Jake Harper.

21:43.626 --> 21:45.106
'DS Morris in attendance.

21:45.145 --> 21:46.505
'Joe, I believe

21:46.546 --> 21:48.145
'you have a statement
you want to read.'

21:49.705 --> 21:52.026
"I, Joe Bancroft, would like
to give a full admission

21:52.066 --> 21:54.066
"as to the murders of Michael
and Susan Connors."

21:54.106 --> 21:55.386
Joe?

21:55.425 --> 21:56.866
My advice?

21:56.905 --> 21:58.665
Take a moment.
"I killed Michael

21:58.705 --> 22:00.026
"and Susan Connors - both of them.

22:01.786 --> 22:03.505
"They deserved to die."

22:05.505 --> 22:07.665
You must be relieved
to get that off your chest?

22:07.705 --> 22:09.225
So what happens now? Is that it?

22:09.266 --> 22:11.465
We take some details about the night
of the murder.

22:11.505 --> 22:13.225
I don't remember much, I was stoned.

22:13.266 --> 22:15.425
I'm sure we can
fill in the pieces together.

22:15.465 --> 22:17.425
For instance,
how did you get to the house?

22:17.465 --> 22:18.586
I drove up there.

22:18.626 --> 22:20.026
You drove?
Yeah.

22:20.066 --> 22:22.425
You don't have a car, though,
do you? I took Annabel's.

22:24.185 --> 22:26.786
And why did you decide
to go to the house, Joe?

22:26.826 --> 22:30.505
I wanted to talk to Michael. He was
trying to break up Annabel and me.

22:30.546 --> 22:32.066
And what happened when you arrived?

22:32.106 --> 22:33.586
Michael was pissed.

22:33.626 --> 22:35.586
He wouldn't listen to me yet.

22:35.626 --> 22:39.346
He went for me, I tried to push him
away, but he came back at me.

22:39.386 --> 22:41.185
I panicked. I grabbed something,

22:41.225 --> 22:42.665
hit him with it.

22:44.266 --> 22:45.786
It was self defence.

22:48.425 --> 22:49.626
Hit him with what?

22:49.665 --> 22:51.546
Erm... I don't remember.

22:51.586 --> 22:52.705
How many times?

22:52.745 --> 22:54.306
Don't remember.

22:54.346 --> 22:55.665
And what about Susan?

22:55.705 --> 22:57.185
Yeah.

22:57.225 --> 22:58.945
Yeah, I killed her, too.

22:58.985 --> 23:01.145
Are you certain it was
that way round, Joe?

23:01.185 --> 23:03.665
You killed Michael and then Susan?
Yes.

23:03.705 --> 23:06.106
Why did you do that, Joe?

23:06.145 --> 23:07.465
She hadn't done anything to you.

23:07.505 --> 23:09.266
She was a bitch to Annabel.

23:09.306 --> 23:11.425
She always supported Michael.

23:11.465 --> 23:13.225
Where was Susan when you found her?

23:13.266 --> 23:14.826
Upstairs, in the bath.

23:14.866 --> 23:16.665
And how exactly did you kill her?

23:16.705 --> 23:18.306
I don't remember.

23:18.346 --> 23:20.066
You don't remember much.

23:22.225 --> 23:23.306
'Then what happened?'

23:23.346 --> 23:25.626
'I ran downstairs,
ran out the house.'

23:25.665 --> 23:27.225
'Same way you came in?'

23:27.266 --> 23:30.425
'Yes. Through the front.
Drove away.'

23:30.465 --> 23:32.866
'Where to?'
'Annabel's flat.'

23:32.905 --> 23:34.665
You must have been covered in blood?

23:34.705 --> 23:36.826
Your shoes, your clothes?

23:36.866 --> 23:38.505
I washed them.

23:39.705 --> 23:41.145
Was Annabel awake when you got back?

23:41.185 --> 23:42.546
No.

23:42.586 --> 23:46.266
No, er... Annabel slept through
the whole thing.

23:47.465 --> 23:48.985
I didn't tell her what I'd done.

23:49.026 --> 23:51.185
This has nothing to do with her.

24:00.185 --> 24:01.745
What are you doing?

24:02.985 --> 24:04.346
Get me DSI Harper.

24:08.665 --> 24:10.505
Guv, you can't come in here.

24:12.665 --> 24:15.225
You might have fooled everyone else,
but you haven't fooled me.

24:15.266 --> 24:18.705
Admit this now and it'll go easier
for you. I have nothing to admit.

24:18.745 --> 24:21.266
Joe didn't kill your parents,
you did! Joe's confessed?

24:21.306 --> 24:22.465
He wants to be a hero!

24:22.505 --> 24:23.826
My God, he killed them?

24:23.866 --> 24:26.185
I'm going to prove that you did it.
He killed Susan?

24:26.225 --> 24:28.185
Don't you play-act...
He killed Daddy?

24:28.225 --> 24:30.346
Don't you DARE!

24:30.386 --> 24:32.505
Out! Now! OUT!

24:32.546 --> 24:33.745
Out!

24:33.786 --> 24:35.185
TELL THE TRUTH!

24:35.225 --> 24:36.346
OUT!

24:36.386 --> 24:39.185
Or I'm arresting you for attempting
to pervert the course of justice.

24:39.225 --> 24:40.386
She has put him up to this,

24:40.425 --> 24:41.786
it is a false confession!

24:41.826 --> 24:43.985
We'll ascertain what's false and
what isn't.

24:44.026 --> 24:46.225
Joe didn't even know
that Michael had been whipped.

24:46.266 --> 24:49.106
He didn't know how Susan died! He
said he came through the front door,

24:49.145 --> 24:52.066
the assailant came through the back!
You think I haven't worked that out?

24:52.106 --> 24:53.225
Throw out the confession!

24:53.266 --> 24:55.546
Stop telling me how to conduct
this investigation!

24:55.586 --> 24:58.425
You're not just risking your job,
you're risking mine, too!

25:00.705 --> 25:03.425
And then who's going to find out
the truth about what happened here?

25:09.225 --> 25:10.386
Do I really need to do this?

25:16.945 --> 25:20.066
I thought she had more control.
It's a tough situation.

25:21.546 --> 25:23.106
It's time to charge Joe Bancroft.

25:23.145 --> 25:24.745
We're not ready, Chief.

25:24.786 --> 25:26.225
Everybody's looking at us.

25:26.266 --> 25:27.465
We need a conviction.

25:27.505 --> 25:30.546
The Connors were high-profile. He's
confessed, what more do you need?

25:30.586 --> 25:33.225
The confession makes me question
the whole case against him.

25:33.266 --> 25:34.505
He's the son of a copper?

25:34.546 --> 25:37.266
Maybe he's given an inaccurate
confession to do just that.

25:37.306 --> 25:39.266
Thanks for coming, everyone.

25:39.306 --> 25:42.026
Erm... as you may know,

25:42.066 --> 25:44.185
my family situation is, erm...

25:44.225 --> 25:46.386
putting me under a great deal of
stress, so...

25:47.945 --> 25:50.106
.. I just feel that at the moment,
I can't give you

25:50.145 --> 25:52.505
the leadership that you require

25:52.546 --> 25:54.546
and deserve.

25:54.586 --> 25:58.546
So I will be taking leave,

25:58.586 --> 26:00.745
with immediate effect.

26:00.786 --> 26:03.586
Now, I want to be
absolutely clear...

26:04.586 --> 26:07.985
.. this is 100% my decision.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.185
No-one else's.

26:11.626 --> 26:15.826
It's a letter of apology to DS
Potter for my regrettable behaviour.

26:17.225 --> 26:19.106
And this is from the doctor.

26:20.705 --> 26:21.905
You have been busy.

26:21.945 --> 26:24.705
You'll be lucky to come back
from all of this.

26:24.745 --> 26:27.266
I've supported you in the past.

26:27.306 --> 26:29.985
I won't do so again.
No, I don't expect you to.

26:30.026 --> 26:31.786
You could have gone
right to the top.

26:33.546 --> 26:35.425
I can't say I'm not
extremely disappointed.

27:18.145 --> 27:19.826
Thank you for what you said
up there.

27:21.745 --> 27:25.106
You hold Joe's future in your hands,
I need the force to get behind you.

27:26.786 --> 27:28.945
Why would he give
a false confession?

27:28.985 --> 27:31.306
Because Annabel's manipulating him.
She's a...

27:31.346 --> 27:33.985
sociopath, psychopath,
whatever you want to call it.

27:34.026 --> 27:36.185
She has no history
of mental disturbance.

27:36.225 --> 27:38.705
She comes from a wealthy,
middle-class family

27:38.745 --> 27:39.985
who were good at covering it up.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.425
She was distraught when she heard
about Michael and Susan.

27:42.465 --> 27:43.985
She lies well.

27:44.026 --> 27:45.826
I mean, look at the facts.

27:45.866 --> 27:47.346
She hardly ever saw her father,

27:47.386 --> 27:48.905
he sent her off to boarding school.

27:48.945 --> 27:52.425
Controlled her relationships,
where she lived,

27:52.465 --> 27:53.745
he controlled her money.

27:53.786 --> 27:55.425
Have you checked the inheritance?

27:55.465 --> 27:56.945
I'm chasing it.

27:58.425 --> 28:01.425
You do realise there is no
forensic evidence against her?

28:01.465 --> 28:04.626
Look, she would have planned this
down to the last detail.

28:04.665 --> 28:07.586
If you're clever, and resilient,

28:07.626 --> 28:09.185
and resourceful,

28:09.225 --> 28:11.386
it's amazing what you can
get away with.

28:15.386 --> 28:16.866
Go through the evidence again.

28:18.266 --> 28:21.145
Let's just see if anything
leads to her.

28:22.626 --> 28:23.985
Please.

28:41.866 --> 28:45.266
Mrs Kamara didn't seem the type
to throw herself out of a window.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.346
Good news for us, though.

28:49.505 --> 28:50.786
Especially you.

28:50.826 --> 28:52.465
No more attacks.

28:52.505 --> 28:54.505
Do you know what I reckon?

28:54.546 --> 28:56.786
No, Andy, but you're obviously
about to tell me.

28:56.826 --> 28:59.386
You switched those names
on the board on purpose.

28:59.425 --> 29:01.985
You knew Daanish would be
in the nick.

29:02.026 --> 29:03.705
That the club would be empty.

29:04.866 --> 29:06.346
You got her there,

29:06.386 --> 29:08.266
you...
I what?

29:10.066 --> 29:12.066
I what?
You topped her.

29:17.106 --> 29:20.066
Mrs Kamara's case
isn't open and shut.

29:20.106 --> 29:21.425
I could recommend it

29:21.465 --> 29:23.586
to become a murder investigation.

29:23.626 --> 29:24.866
It'd all come out, then.

29:24.905 --> 29:26.505
Us running Daanish,

29:26.546 --> 29:28.225
her standing up to him.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.465
You'd bring yourself down like that?

29:30.505 --> 29:32.465
If I went
to professional standards,

29:32.505 --> 29:34.786
turned myself over as a witness,
I might survive it.

29:36.306 --> 29:38.026
I wouldn't be following your orders.

29:41.665 --> 29:43.225
What do you want, Andy?

29:45.386 --> 29:47.826
Time I was made DI.

29:49.066 --> 29:52.665
Well, I'm not in a position
to do that any more.

29:54.346 --> 29:56.786
You've still got
the Chief Constable's ear.

29:56.826 --> 29:58.306
Sort it.

30:02.866 --> 30:04.145
Blackmail?

30:05.386 --> 30:07.586
Shitty little crime.

30:07.626 --> 30:10.346
Carried out by shitty little people.

30:29.571 --> 30:31.851
Bancroft! Miss Bancroft!
Bancroft!

30:36.531 --> 30:37.851
Excuse me.

30:37.890 --> 30:39.251
I've got nothing to say.

30:39.291 --> 30:41.291
Excuse me.

30:42.650 --> 30:43.930
Can we have a quote?

31:00.851 --> 31:02.331
Well?

31:02.370 --> 31:04.251
They're still questioning him.

31:07.091 --> 31:09.291
They haven't charged him, yet.

31:10.571 --> 31:12.331
Shouldn't you be there with him?

31:13.771 --> 31:14.930
I'm off sick.

31:16.410 --> 31:19.331
If you're sick,
it's the first time in 45 years.

31:19.370 --> 31:20.730
You don't even catch cold.

31:20.771 --> 31:23.690
If I hadn't have signed myself off,
they'd have suspended me.

31:23.730 --> 31:25.730
So, erm... You know...

31:26.811 --> 31:27.930
Least bad option.

31:31.450 --> 31:33.450
Must have been hard to walk away.

31:36.251 --> 31:37.571
He didn't do it.

31:38.571 --> 31:41.930
He didn't kill anyone.

31:45.690 --> 31:47.890
You really believe that there's
no part of him

31:47.930 --> 31:50.170
that could have done this?
Yes. I'm certain.

31:51.331 --> 31:53.450
He's taking the fall for Annabel.

31:53.491 --> 31:54.730
She's...

31:54.771 --> 31:57.251
She's just got this hold over him...

31:57.291 --> 32:00.331
All he wants to do is please her.

32:00.370 --> 32:02.291
And hurt me.

32:02.331 --> 32:04.130
Why?

32:07.170 --> 32:08.491
What happened between you?

32:08.531 --> 32:09.930
Doesn't matter.

32:12.571 --> 32:16.331
Look, I need to figure Annabel out,
need to do a bit of digging on her

32:16.370 --> 32:18.331
and it's just not going to work,
you being here.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.611
You neither.

32:19.650 --> 32:22.851
With the press camped outside?

32:23.890 --> 32:25.170
They'll never leave you alone.

32:29.051 --> 32:31.450
Why didn't you call your brothers
from the caravan?

32:31.491 --> 32:33.491
Tell them where you were?

32:33.531 --> 32:35.851
I should have, I just...

32:35.890 --> 32:37.890
I was scared that if Joe saw me

32:37.930 --> 32:39.410
make a phone call, he might lose it.

32:40.811 --> 32:41.890
Sorry.

32:41.930 --> 32:43.650
Sorry!

32:44.690 --> 32:46.251
Sorry, I just can't stop thinking...

32:47.450 --> 32:48.771
.. Daddy...

32:48.811 --> 32:51.690
and Susan, if I'd never met Joe,
none of this would have happened.

32:51.730 --> 32:54.771
Let's put Joe's confession
to one side for the moment.

32:56.130 --> 32:57.771
We want to hear your side
of the story.

32:57.811 --> 33:01.771
How you met Joe, when you introduced
him to your dad, your stepmother.

33:03.450 --> 33:05.331
It's useful for us to have context.

33:06.771 --> 33:09.571
Er... I met him eight months ago,

33:09.611 --> 33:11.331
at the hospital.

33:11.370 --> 33:12.890
He was so sweet!

33:12.930 --> 33:15.210
Vulnerable,
that's why I fell for him.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.571
I didn't think for a moment
he was violent.

33:18.611 --> 33:20.930
It's interesting to hear you say
he was vulnerable.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.291
Can you help me understand
what you mean by that?

33:24.331 --> 33:26.450
Yeah, he smoked a lot of weed.

33:27.571 --> 33:29.370
No, he had this girlfriend who died,

33:29.410 --> 33:30.811
a policewoman.

33:30.851 --> 33:32.251
Katherine.

33:32.291 --> 33:33.730
He was really messed up about her.

33:33.771 --> 33:37.370
And he said his mother was dead,
too. Dead?

33:39.091 --> 33:40.970
I thought she was going to hit me
in the cells.

33:42.251 --> 33:43.650
She really came at me.

33:43.690 --> 33:45.611
Is that normal with her?

33:45.650 --> 33:48.650
You can understand why
we can't discuss a colleague.

33:49.690 --> 33:50.970
No, of course.

33:51.011 --> 33:53.531
And I'm not going to put in
a complaint about her, I just...

33:55.130 --> 33:57.611
Just want you to keep her
away from me.

33:57.650 --> 34:00.011
She's no longer in the building.

34:00.051 --> 34:02.771
Must be such a terrible situation
for her.

34:04.130 --> 34:05.450
She's taking leave.

34:05.491 --> 34:08.811
So you introduced Joe
to your dad...?

34:08.851 --> 34:10.771
Yeah, in the autumn.

34:10.811 --> 34:12.370
They got on fine at first.

34:12.409 --> 34:14.571
Then Joe lost his job,

34:14.610 --> 34:17.210
moved into my flat,
started getting bad.

34:18.531 --> 34:20.531
Then we got engaged.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.451
Joe and my dad just clashed.

34:25.491 --> 34:28.571
Joe had this thing about
how parents mess you up.

34:28.610 --> 34:30.371
He had so much anger inside him.

34:31.690 --> 34:33.690
You said earlier you had no idea

34:33.730 --> 34:35.571
Joe could be violent.

34:35.610 --> 34:38.411
No, anger doesn't have to be
the same thing as violence.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.491
I think that's why he did it...

34:44.091 --> 34:45.491
Because Dad wouldn't let us marry.

34:45.531 --> 34:47.451
Do you ever think he might have
done it for you?

34:50.371 --> 34:52.290
No, I didn't put any ideas like that
in his head.

34:52.330 --> 34:56.330
I didn't say you put any ideas
into his head.

34:56.371 --> 34:58.330
Do you think you did?

34:58.371 --> 34:59.931
N... No!

35:01.290 --> 35:02.810
So...

35:02.850 --> 35:05.971
your father was trying to stop
your relationship?

35:07.210 --> 35:10.011
You must have been a bit annoyed
about it? Not really.

35:11.130 --> 35:13.770
I knew he'd come round,
we were very close.

35:13.810 --> 35:17.051
So you didn't feel frustrated
by his behaviour towards Joe?

35:17.091 --> 35:19.250
I thought he could have been kinder,
but...

35:19.290 --> 35:21.011
now, I just think...

35:21.051 --> 35:23.571
he saw what Joe was.

35:23.611 --> 35:25.170
How dangerous he was.

35:28.130 --> 35:30.931
When people cry that much,
I stop believing them.

35:30.971 --> 35:32.611
You've been talking to Bancroft.
No.

35:32.650 --> 35:35.130
Why? I don't want her views
influencing us.

35:35.170 --> 35:37.051
You were too tough on Annabel.

35:37.091 --> 35:39.971
Due respect, guv,
you weren't tough enough.

35:40.011 --> 35:41.290
Go on.

35:41.330 --> 35:42.650
She was fishing.

35:42.690 --> 35:43.850
She hooked you.

35:43.891 --> 35:46.130
You told her the guv
had gone on leave.

35:53.770 --> 35:56.650
We arrested all of them.
Kept them in overnight.

35:56.690 --> 35:58.850
We're still holding two people
in custody.

35:58.891 --> 36:01.770
The woman who died at the raided
club, Naila Kamara.

36:01.810 --> 36:04.690
Was her death linked to any
of her son's drug activity?

36:04.730 --> 36:06.451
Doesn't look like it. Accidental.

36:07.810 --> 36:09.931
Are you sure about that?

36:13.690 --> 36:16.531
Bancroft did for Mrs Kamara.

36:16.571 --> 36:18.011
I know it.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.931
And I just can't prove it.

36:21.051 --> 36:23.730
All this, it's destroying you.

36:24.971 --> 36:26.770
Andy Bevan's got a phone.

36:27.931 --> 36:29.091
A burner.

36:29.130 --> 36:30.250
So?

36:31.650 --> 36:33.810
Well, if he's got one,
Bancroft must have one.

36:33.850 --> 36:35.650
That's obviously how they're
communicating.

36:37.650 --> 36:39.810
If I could get hold of
one of those...

36:41.011 --> 36:42.730
.. Andy's might be the easiest...

36:42.770 --> 36:44.091
And then what?

36:47.210 --> 36:48.491
You're the techie.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.931
Intercepting calls is illegal.

36:54.971 --> 36:56.290
It's one thing.

36:56.330 --> 36:58.290
It's all I'm asking.
Dad!

36:58.330 --> 37:00.531
If you get caught,
you'll go to prison.

37:01.891 --> 37:03.690
I've always played fair.

37:03.730 --> 37:05.051
All my life.

37:06.371 --> 37:09.091
But with Bancroft, playing fair
doesn't work with her.

37:09.130 --> 37:10.411
To catch her...

37:11.531 --> 37:14.371
.. you've gotta think like her,
you've gotta act like her.

37:18.091 --> 37:20.250
I can't do this any other way.

37:34.971 --> 37:37.491
So take those, right,
and head around...

37:57.451 --> 37:59.250
I really need to get it back to him.

38:02.810 --> 38:04.971
Come on, he'll be leaving
in a minute.

38:10.770 --> 38:11.971
Done.

38:12.011 --> 38:13.690
How does it work?

38:13.730 --> 38:16.091
Andy Bevan is texting
only two numbers on this.

38:16.130 --> 38:18.091
Yep. When he contacts
either of them,

38:18.130 --> 38:20.290
your phone will ring.
OK.

38:22.451 --> 38:23.971
Yeah, no problem, Dad

38:32.330 --> 38:34.451
Give us five, yeah?

38:36.611 --> 38:38.730
Before you start about Mrs Kamara,

38:38.770 --> 38:40.451
the post-mortem's legit.

38:41.611 --> 38:43.371
Your funeral, Andy, not mine.

38:54.770 --> 38:57.451
When did you last come home?

38:57.491 --> 38:59.491
Bet you can't remember!

38:59.531 --> 39:00.531
No.

39:01.571 --> 39:03.250
Christmas, I think.

39:03.290 --> 39:05.411
You were with Joe.

39:08.810 --> 39:11.091
It was probably about
three years ago.

39:20.891 --> 39:23.571
We've picked up CCTV footage
of a blue van driving at speed

39:23.611 --> 39:25.411
through Downham Village.

39:25.451 --> 39:27.690
As you can see, the number plates
have been obscured.

39:27.730 --> 39:30.411
Does Joe Bancroft have access
to this sort of vehicle?

39:30.451 --> 39:31.730
We're checking.

39:31.770 --> 39:35.371
We need to close on this case.
Joe's confession has holes in it

39:35.411 --> 39:38.091
and I'm still not entirely sure
Annabel Connors isn't involved.

39:38.130 --> 39:40.371
Could it have been her that took
the gun from the lodge?

39:40.411 --> 39:42.371
Maybe. She had access
to the building,

39:42.411 --> 39:44.130
but we didn't find the gun
in the caravan.

39:44.170 --> 39:46.330
We're presently searching
the woods for the gun...

39:46.371 --> 39:48.571
Make sure that's a priority.

39:48.611 --> 39:50.250
Any evidence pointing to her?

39:50.290 --> 39:51.770
This has come in.

39:51.810 --> 39:53.971
Susan Connors' engagement ring.

39:54.011 --> 39:57.130
It was stolen during the murder.
We found it in the caravan.

39:57.170 --> 39:59.130
It ties one of them to the scene
of the crime.

39:59.170 --> 40:00.810
But why would he take it?

40:00.850 --> 40:02.210
To sell it?

40:02.250 --> 40:04.891
No, nothing else was stolen.
It feels specific.

40:04.931 --> 40:07.850
And Annabel did have a motive.

40:07.891 --> 40:09.011
Money from her mother.

40:09.051 --> 40:11.690
Michael's a trustee and he wasn't
letting her anywhere near it.

40:11.730 --> 40:12.730
How much?

40:12.770 --> 40:14.290
Nearly three million.

40:15.850 --> 40:17.411
What if Joe did it?

40:17.451 --> 40:19.411
But under her influence?

40:19.451 --> 40:21.810
It can be difficult to prove.

40:21.850 --> 40:23.411
Both parties always blame
each other.

40:23.451 --> 40:26.290
What if we went down that route
and we couldn't get to convict

40:26.330 --> 40:28.051
either Joe Bancroft
or Annabel Connors?

40:28.091 --> 40:29.730
It would look terrible
for the force.

40:29.770 --> 40:30.810
All due respect, guv,

40:30.850 --> 40:33.210
it's not my job to think of
the political repercussions.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.531
But it is mine.

40:36.810 --> 40:39.330
I'd like an additional 12 hours'
detention time.

40:39.371 --> 40:41.531
As long as you call in the CPS.

40:53.105 --> 40:55.906
Sure you didn't know? I'd remember
if I knocked off my own mum!

40:55.946 --> 40:57.505
Why did Bancroft decide
to arrest you?

40:57.545 --> 40:59.826
She was stressing about a copper
who was onto us.

40:59.866 --> 41:02.946
Why am I not included
in what's happening any more?

41:02.986 --> 41:04.225
What else did you talk about?

41:04.266 --> 41:06.105
Why should I tell you?

41:06.145 --> 41:08.386
Questioning me
like fucking Mastermind!

41:10.545 --> 41:11.986
Sorry.

41:13.266 --> 41:14.786
There's just a lot going on.
Yeah.

41:17.466 --> 41:18.866
I told her about an opportunity.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.625
She didn't go for it.

41:23.025 --> 41:24.705
Bancroft's out of the picture,
anyway.

41:24.746 --> 41:26.466
What opportunity?

41:28.065 --> 41:29.665
There's a new man.

41:29.705 --> 41:31.065
Works out of Liverpool.

41:31.105 --> 41:32.986
Wants me to go in with him.

41:33.025 --> 41:34.786
But I'll need protection.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.986
I could help if there's enough
in it for me.

41:38.025 --> 41:40.466
He's handing over 500K,

41:40.505 --> 41:41.786
to launder through the club.

41:41.826 --> 41:43.665
I get 10%.

41:45.105 --> 41:47.266
I'll let him get eyes on you.

41:47.306 --> 41:48.786
I'll split it.

41:55.866 --> 41:58.346
When was the last time
someone cooked for you?

41:59.466 --> 42:01.145
I don't live that kind of life.

42:02.585 --> 42:04.025
Just eat when I can, really.

42:05.946 --> 42:07.225
But Joe did, didn't he?

42:08.386 --> 42:10.946
Before he left?
Yeah. Yeah.

42:12.065 --> 42:13.105
Joe did, yeah.

42:19.746 --> 42:20.986
He came to see me.

42:23.145 --> 42:25.266
After he'd moved out of yours.

42:25.306 --> 42:27.505
He was in a state.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.705
A girl had died.

42:34.145 --> 42:37.746
He seemed to think it was because
of him? He was all mixed up.

42:38.986 --> 42:40.185
Mixed up how?

42:49.065 --> 42:52.145
I can't help thinking that maybe
this is all my fault.

42:52.185 --> 42:53.306
Of course it isn't.

42:53.346 --> 42:55.185
But you weren't like other children.

42:57.225 --> 42:59.065
Somehow, I couldn't get through
to you.

43:00.746 --> 43:02.346
I wasn't a good mother.

43:02.386 --> 43:04.705
You were fine.
No.

43:04.746 --> 43:06.625
Kept myself too distant.

43:06.665 --> 43:09.386
You know, sometimes, children and
parents, they just don't get on.

43:09.426 --> 43:10.786
It's just...

43:10.826 --> 43:12.746
You know, it's just the way it is.

43:14.306 --> 43:16.426
I should have tried harder.

43:16.466 --> 43:19.266
But everything that your father
was frightened of,

43:19.306 --> 43:21.625
I began to be frightened of, too.

43:22.625 --> 43:23.986
I'm sorry?

43:24.025 --> 43:26.145
What has this got to do with him?

43:28.306 --> 43:29.946
You never talk about him.

43:31.866 --> 43:34.826
Do you know, you've never even
told me why he left.

43:34.866 --> 43:36.466
Was it my fault? Is that it?

43:36.505 --> 43:38.665
Of course not, you were a baby!

43:40.705 --> 43:42.545
But Joe's different.

43:44.105 --> 43:47.306
You've got him into this trouble.
No, I didn't! I've...

43:47.346 --> 43:48.986
I'm always protecting Joe!

43:49.025 --> 43:53.266
You didn't realise that YOU'RE
the one he needed protecting from.

43:54.426 --> 43:56.545
How dare you?

43:57.585 --> 43:59.306
I know what you are, Elizabeth.

43:59.346 --> 44:01.466
I think I've always known.

44:03.505 --> 44:05.746
How could I not? You're my child.

44:05.786 --> 44:08.306
I know what you're capable of.

44:09.866 --> 44:12.306
Joe's girlfriend that died...

44:15.946 --> 44:17.225
.. what happened?

45:12.625 --> 45:15.306
Katherine was digging into my past.

45:16.665 --> 45:18.545
She didn't love Joe.

45:20.306 --> 45:21.585
She was just using him.

45:22.866 --> 45:24.625
To get to me.

45:28.266 --> 45:29.585
I didn't have a choice.

45:39.665 --> 45:41.025
Joe found out.

45:45.665 --> 45:47.906
Oh, the poor boy.

45:51.826 --> 45:53.145
I don't enjoy it.

45:54.746 --> 45:55.986
I don't...

45:57.545 --> 45:59.065
.. go looking for it.

46:00.585 --> 46:01.986
It's a necessity.

46:06.185 --> 46:07.585
Things come back at you.

46:09.266 --> 46:11.105
In ways you never thought.

46:14.065 --> 46:15.346
Yes.

46:21.466 --> 46:22.986
Elizabeth...

46:25.346 --> 46:27.466
.. don't give up on Joe.

46:30.705 --> 46:32.185
Fight Annabel.

46:33.826 --> 46:36.105
Do whatever you have to.

47:03.065 --> 47:06.665
I wasn't headmistress of the school
when Annabel Connors was here.

47:06.705 --> 47:08.866
So you've no knowledge of her
at all, then?

47:08.906 --> 47:10.386
None whatsoever.

47:10.426 --> 47:12.866
Well, one of the other teachers
must remember her?

47:12.906 --> 47:14.386
They're all in morning classes.

47:14.426 --> 47:17.346
Perhaps you could come back
at a more convenient time?

47:17.386 --> 47:19.585
Sorry, this, er...

47:19.625 --> 47:21.386
This picture.

47:21.426 --> 47:23.786
This was taken ten years ago.

47:23.826 --> 47:25.946
Yes.

47:25.986 --> 47:27.185
I was a house leader.

47:29.505 --> 47:31.986
So you were here when she was here,
then?

47:35.105 --> 47:36.505
This is a murder investigation.

47:38.386 --> 47:41.065
You need to tell me everything
you know about Annabel Connors.

47:42.866 --> 47:44.866
It was the second year
of their "A" Levels.

47:45.946 --> 47:48.185
They both got expelled.

47:48.225 --> 47:49.466
It was a shock.

47:50.505 --> 47:51.705
They were star pupils.

47:53.466 --> 47:54.946
How much did they steal?

47:56.266 --> 47:57.906
Just under ã10,000.

47:59.946 --> 48:03.705
I always believed the online fraud
was Annabel's idea.

48:03.746 --> 48:07.105
She had a strong influence
over Charlotte.

48:07.145 --> 48:08.826
And...

48:08.866 --> 48:11.145
Annabel could be charming.

48:11.185 --> 48:13.705
Why is there no police report
on this?

48:13.746 --> 48:16.105
Annabel and Charlotte's parents

48:16.145 --> 48:17.386
paid back the money

48:17.426 --> 48:20.545
and the school persuaded
the girls who'd been defrauded

48:20.585 --> 48:21.946
not to press charges.

48:21.986 --> 48:23.225
So you hushed it up.

48:23.266 --> 48:26.786
It was an extremely difficult
situation, and...

48:28.266 --> 48:30.185
.. there were other factors at play.

48:30.225 --> 48:31.545
What other factors?

48:33.705 --> 48:36.185
I looked after Annabel
when she first arrived.

48:36.225 --> 48:37.545
How old was she?

48:37.585 --> 48:39.225
Seven.

48:39.266 --> 48:40.545
What was she like?

48:41.786 --> 48:43.185
Withdrawn.

48:43.225 --> 48:45.065
She'd lost her mother,

48:45.105 --> 48:48.705
her father showed no care for her
at all.

48:50.386 --> 48:53.585
I managed to bring her out of
her shell a bit.

48:53.625 --> 48:55.466
Then the stepmother came along.

48:56.466 --> 48:57.906
Susan.

48:57.946 --> 48:59.665
She was Michael Connors' secretary.

49:00.866 --> 49:02.545
She cared for him and no-one else.

49:02.585 --> 49:05.025
Certainly not Annabel, anyway.

49:05.065 --> 49:07.306
And do you think Annabel
resented that?

49:07.346 --> 49:09.545
Well, if she did,
she didn't show it.

49:10.986 --> 49:12.946
She became very good
at masking her feelings.

49:12.986 --> 49:14.986
She stopped talking to me.

49:16.225 --> 49:18.986
By the end of her time at senior
school, we'd had hardly any contact.

49:20.105 --> 49:21.866
Though that wasn't her version
of events.

49:23.746 --> 49:24.946
What do you mean?

49:24.986 --> 49:27.786
Annabel said if I went to
the police...

49:29.386 --> 49:32.306
.. she'd accuse me of sexual abuse.

49:34.065 --> 49:35.665
My career...

49:35.705 --> 49:37.505
my life would have been over.

49:45.986 --> 49:48.145
She threatened and blackmailed
her teacher.

49:50.866 --> 49:53.826
She's a liar, she's a thief.
Why shouldn't she be a murderer?

49:55.986 --> 49:58.185
Chief doesn't want to put Annabel
in front of a jury.

49:58.225 --> 50:00.386
Why not?

50:00.426 --> 50:02.225
She's from a good home.

50:03.466 --> 50:06.185
Good family, she's a doctor.
She has no record.

50:06.225 --> 50:07.545
She presents well.

50:09.025 --> 50:11.986
Chief reckons it will be hard to get
a conviction. CPS agrees with her.

50:13.866 --> 50:16.665
I'm under pressure to charge Joe.

50:17.986 --> 50:21.306
No. No, no, no.
Joe thinks if he goes down,

50:21.346 --> 50:24.105
I can get his sentence shortened.

50:24.145 --> 50:25.625
What?

50:25.665 --> 50:27.466
He's protecting Annabel!

50:27.505 --> 50:29.185
She's spun him a line.

50:29.225 --> 50:30.906
You've got to find out what.

50:40.121 --> 50:43.121
Let's start with some new evidence
that's come in.

50:43.161 --> 50:45.681
We found this in the caravan.

50:45.721 --> 50:47.081
Do you recognise it?

50:47.121 --> 50:48.561
Yeah.

50:48.601 --> 50:50.561
Who does it belong to?
Annabel.

50:50.601 --> 50:52.121
Do you know where it came from?

50:52.161 --> 50:54.161
She has lots of nice jewellery.

50:54.201 --> 50:56.320
This isn't just nice jewellery, Joe.

50:56.360 --> 51:00.721
It's an antique emerald ring.
How often does she wear it?

51:00.761 --> 51:01.960
I don't know.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.440
When did you last see it on her?
I don't know.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.360
It was Susan Connors'
engagement ring.

51:11.400 --> 51:14.480
We believe she was wearing it
when she was murdered.

51:14.521 --> 51:16.840
Her finger was broken
to get it off.

51:16.880 --> 51:19.041
Can you tell us how that came about?

51:20.280 --> 51:22.440
I don't remember.
So you don't remember

51:22.480 --> 51:24.880
taking the ring from Susan's body,
but you do remember the ring?

51:24.920 --> 51:26.161
Yeah, that's right.

51:26.201 --> 51:28.601
And you said it belonged to Annabel.

51:28.641 --> 51:32.081
No... What I meant to say
is that I gave it to Annabel.

51:32.121 --> 51:34.121
Sure that's right, Joe?
Yeah.

51:34.161 --> 51:37.601
Are you sure SHE didn't bring
that ring to the caravan?

51:37.641 --> 51:39.561
Joe, come ON! COME ON!

51:40.840 --> 51:43.360
Before you go down for 30 years
for this girl,

51:43.400 --> 51:44.721
and 30 years it will be,

51:44.761 --> 51:47.880
you need to know
that Annabel is not defending you.

51:48.920 --> 51:51.840
And what would really help us right
now is if you told us the truth.

51:51.880 --> 51:53.121
I have.

51:55.201 --> 51:57.840
When we last spoke, you said that

51:57.880 --> 52:01.880
Susan was a bitch to Annabel
and that she supported Michael.

52:01.920 --> 52:03.201
What did you mean by that?

52:03.241 --> 52:04.400
Nothing.

52:04.440 --> 52:06.721
Annabel said she had a good
relationship with her father.

52:06.761 --> 52:08.121
Susan, too. Come on!

52:08.161 --> 52:09.320
She's just saying that.

52:10.400 --> 52:11.641
So she's lying?

52:11.681 --> 52:14.920
She's got good reason to.
It's hard to talk about.

52:16.360 --> 52:18.521
Did she say that he abused her?

52:23.081 --> 52:26.761
She's accused other people
of sexual abuse. No?

52:26.800 --> 52:28.121
Yeah. Her schoolteacher.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.721
From what we understand,
it was a lie.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.440
No, Annabel wouldn't lie
about something like that.

52:38.480 --> 52:39.440
She...

52:43.641 --> 52:45.960
Let's find out, shall we?

52:52.201 --> 52:55.041
You want a drink of water?
You look like you need one.

53:12.641 --> 53:14.320
I've been here
for over 24 hours.

53:17.400 --> 53:19.121
Surely your lawyer's
explained to you

53:19.161 --> 53:21.320
that we've extended
your arrest period?

53:21.360 --> 53:24.561
You really expect me to answer
more questions? On no sleep?

53:26.280 --> 53:27.721
Have a breather, why don't you?

53:30.601 --> 53:32.121
I'm sorry if you had a bad night,

53:32.161 --> 53:34.121
but some new evidence
has come through.

53:34.161 --> 53:36.721
Do you recognise this?

53:36.761 --> 53:39.121
Yeah, it's Susan's engagement ring.

53:39.161 --> 53:40.920
Do you know where we found it?

53:40.960 --> 53:42.800
On Susan's finger?

53:42.840 --> 53:44.561
It was in the caravan.

53:44.601 --> 53:47.161
So, Joe must have stolen it.

53:47.201 --> 53:50.320
The thing is, this ring
means nothing to Joe,

53:50.360 --> 53:52.960
but it means a lot to you,
doesn't it? Not really.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.641
This ring belonged to someone else,
didn't it?

53:57.480 --> 53:58.880
Before Susan.

54:00.041 --> 54:01.761
You know anyway, why are you asking?

54:01.800 --> 54:03.440
I'd like to hear you say it.

54:05.041 --> 54:06.320
My mother.

54:07.480 --> 54:09.081
The ring belonged to my mother.

54:10.241 --> 54:11.480
And how did it make you feel

54:11.521 --> 54:13.681
when your father gave that ring
to Susan?

54:13.721 --> 54:15.681
You want me to say I was angry,
right?

54:17.081 --> 54:19.641
"Susan had taken my mother's place.
I despised her."

54:20.880 --> 54:23.360
That would be good, wouldn't it?
Then I'd have motive.

54:24.601 --> 54:26.201
Except it isn't true.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.201
I don't remember my mother.

54:29.241 --> 54:31.360
I was four when she died.

54:31.400 --> 54:34.360
You realise, if everything
you've told us is a fabrication,

54:34.400 --> 54:36.201
it's better for you

54:36.241 --> 54:37.761
if you admit that right now.

54:37.800 --> 54:39.400
Instead of accusing me,

54:39.440 --> 54:42.681
why don't you do your job
and charge Joe?

54:42.721 --> 54:45.440
Except of course,
he's the son of your boss.

54:46.521 --> 54:48.161
That's what this is about, isn't it?

54:48.201 --> 54:49.641
You're biased.

54:49.681 --> 54:52.161
You're defending
that deranged woman.

54:53.561 --> 54:55.681
Did your father at any stage

54:55.721 --> 54:58.081
behave inappropriately towards you,
Annabel?

55:01.041 --> 55:03.201
What?
Did he physically mistreat you?

55:03.241 --> 55:04.360
No, he never hurt me.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.561
Did he sexually molest you?

55:05.601 --> 55:06.960
No, OK?

55:07.000 --> 55:09.400
No, my father did not molest me.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.241
It's disgusting.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.800
He's been dead a week
and you're accusing him of that?

55:13.840 --> 55:16.521
So your relationship
with your father was... good?

55:16.561 --> 55:19.161
He loved me, I loved him.

55:19.201 --> 55:22.360
And you never told Joe that
he abused you?

55:23.601 --> 55:25.121
If he said that, he's a liar.

55:25.161 --> 55:27.400
But Joe was your boyfriend
for eight months.

55:29.280 --> 55:30.800
You're engaged.

55:30.840 --> 55:33.360
Don't you have any feelings
left for him?

55:36.041 --> 55:37.880
I don't know what I ever saw in him.

55:39.521 --> 55:41.000
He killed my father.

55:42.561 --> 55:44.280
I loathe him.

55:50.280 --> 55:51.761
Joe...

55:51.800 --> 55:54.161
you need to stop thinking about
saving Annabel

55:54.201 --> 55:55.880
and think about saving yourself.

55:55.920 --> 55:57.920
You're in the frame, Joe.
You're in big trouble.

55:57.960 --> 56:00.201
Your shoes,
we found them at the flat.

56:00.241 --> 56:02.960
They had Michael Connors' blood
all over the soles.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.681
I haven't worn them shoes in ages.

56:04.721 --> 56:07.521
The analysis of the work phone
sited it at the Connors' house

56:07.561 --> 56:08.641
the night of the murders.

56:08.681 --> 56:10.800
I lost that phone, I...

56:10.840 --> 56:12.521
When I left the hospital.

56:12.561 --> 56:15.081
The way I see it, there's three
possibilities here, Joe.

56:15.121 --> 56:16.761
Either you did it,

56:16.800 --> 56:18.960
you did it with Annabel,
or you've been set up.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.800
Michael Connors was tortured.

56:20.840 --> 56:21.960
Whipped,

56:22.000 --> 56:24.241
half to death.
That is not self defence, Joe.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.721
You're looking at a double murder
charge. This is life!

56:26.761 --> 56:29.121
Don't think your mum can pull
any strings,

56:29.161 --> 56:32.561
cos these are way too serious, Joe.
Joe, JOE! Did you do this?

56:32.601 --> 56:34.920
Or did you do it with Annabel?
What happened that night?

56:34.960 --> 56:36.320
What happened, Joe?
Joe!

56:36.360 --> 56:37.800
What happened?
Listen to me!

56:37.840 --> 56:39.601
Joe! JOE!
I didn't do it!

56:39.641 --> 56:41.081
I didn't do it, I didn't do it!

56:41.121 --> 56:44.041
I couldn't kill anyone, I couldn't!

56:48.880 --> 56:50.521
I was just trying to help Annabel.

57:10.681 --> 57:12.440
Who is this guy, anyway?

57:14.400 --> 57:16.000
The less you know, the better.

57:27.480 --> 57:28.561
He's late.

57:33.561 --> 57:35.201
I'm going for a piss.

58:05.041 --> 58:06.201
Yeah.

58:06.241 --> 58:08.121
This new guy Daanish wanted you
to go in with.

58:09.320 --> 58:10.761
Why did you say no?

58:10.800 --> 58:12.761
I didn't like the sound of him.

58:12.800 --> 58:15.721
Why, you're not getting yourself
mixed up with him, are you?

58:17.400 --> 58:19.241
Have you thought about
what I asked you?

58:20.400 --> 58:21.561
Yes.

58:22.601 --> 58:23.601
And?

58:24.761 --> 58:26.601
I'll talk to the Chief Constable
tomorrow.

58:57.761 --> 58:59.241
Is your man not turning up?

59:00.561 --> 59:01.761
Let's get out of here, man.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.201
Took long enough.

59:30.681 --> 59:31.840
Thanks, Janice.

59:31.880 --> 59:33.161
See you later.

59:33.201 --> 59:34.241
Thanks, love.

59:42.241 --> 59:44.601
Well?
It's done.

59:44.641 --> 59:47.840
You and I should keep away
from each other from now on.

59:47.880 --> 59:49.041
Yeah.

59:49.081 --> 59:51.000
Yeah, I agree.

01:00:15.761 --> 01:00:16.880
What's happening?

01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:25.201
They found the murder weapon in
a skip near Annabel and Joe's flat.

01:00:26.561 --> 01:00:28.561
Croquet mallet
from the Connors' garden.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.880
It's got Joe's fingerprints
all over it.

01:00:34.201 --> 01:00:36.161
CPS have authorised charging Joe.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.561
What about Annabel?

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.601
I pushed to charge her,
they refused.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.480
We're releasing her on police bail.

01:00:50.241 --> 01:00:52.400
There's just not enough evidence
against her.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.081
Mum!
Joe!

01:01:04.121 --> 01:01:05.320
Mum! Joe!
Mum!

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.280
Joe! It's my Joe. Joe!

01:01:08.721 --> 01:01:09.840
Joe!

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.840
JOE!
