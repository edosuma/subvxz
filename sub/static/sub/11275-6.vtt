about you being cut off.

You know, I remember            
the good old days

when you used                   
to come in here and             

07:48.300 --> 07:49.900
say something funny.

You'd drink it,                 
I'd pour you another one,

you'd drink that, too.

I'll tell you, I don't          
normally drink beer, but, uh,   

08:04.200 --> 08:07.100
I just cleaned the taps,        
and I wanted to make sure       

08:07.100 --> 08:09.800
that everything was all right,  
so I had one.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.100
 I think that's the first time  
      I've really laughed       

11:42.200 --> 11:43.300
    since I took over here.     

11:43.300 --> 11:45.200
      Oh, it is, trust me.      

11:49.400 --> 11:51.700
 Why'd you tell me that story?  

11:51.700 --> 11:53.100
      Well, I don't know.       

11:53.100 --> 11:54.500
    It's kind of late.

I'm a man, you're a woman.      

11:59.200 --> 12:00.500
 Maybe it's the paint talking.  

12:04.700 --> 12:05.800
                        Norm?   

12:05.900 --> 12:07.100
Yeah.                           

12:07.200 --> 12:09.400
      Do you find me cold?      

12:09.400 --> 12:10.700
              You?              

12:10.800 --> 12:12.100
        Cold? No.               

12:12.100 --> 12:13.400
    No, I wouldn't say cold.    

12:13.500 --> 12:14.600
            Coolish.            

12:15.700 --> 12:17.000
    In the brisk area,          

12:17.100 --> 12:18.300

12:18.400 --> 12:20.000

I don't think you're cold.      

12:24.300 --> 12:25.500
            Really?             

12:25.500 --> 12:27.000
      Yeah. I always meant      
    to tell you that,           

12:27.000 --> 12:29.100
    but I didn't feel           
as though I could approach you. 

12:35.500 --> 12:37.300
                Thank you, Norm.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.600
Thank you.                      

12:40.600 --> 12:42.300
            Uh, well, I'd better
            get out of here.    

12:42.400 --> 12:44.100
              Um, would you mind
              locking up for me?

12:44.200 --> 12:45.600
No, no, I don't mind at all.    

12:45.700 --> 12:47.400
            Listen, would you   
            please not, uh,     

12:47.400 --> 12:49.500
        mention that I like     
        painting to the guys?

         I'm a weenie.          

12:52.300 --> 12:53.800
Well, from what I've seen,      

12:53.800 --> 12:55.000
    he's an authority.          

12:55.000 --> 12:56.400
             Yeah.              

12:56.400 --> 12:57.900
                         Well...

12:57.900 --> 13:00.100
      And, really, thanks       
 for letting me paint an office 

13:00.100 --> 13:01.600
  that clearly didn't need it.  

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
          No problem.           

13:02.600 --> 13:04.700
    You're a nice man, Norm.    

13:04.800 --> 13:06.700
 You're kind of nice yourself.  

13:06.700 --> 13:08.800
  I guess we like each other.   

13:08.900 --> 13:10.100
        Guess so.               

13:10.200 --> 13:11.200
             Great.             

13:11.200 --> 13:13.900
    This will just be           
    our little secret.          

13:13.900 --> 13:14.500
        Oh, yeah.               

13:22.800 --> 13:24.300
  I am a little worried about   

13:24.300 --> 13:26.400
              the direction this
              bar is taking.    

13:26.500 --> 13:27.400
            How so?             

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
              Well, it just     
              doesn't seem right

13:29.500 --> 13:31.600
              when the stakes   
              for a game of pool

                 is a round of  
                 wine spritzers.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.500
Not even the pool room is safe

from the encroaching            
hordes of yuppiedom.

until we're all suffocated

Oh, oh, by the way, Sam,        

13:47.900 --> 13:50.700

            or something, Sam?

I say we check the office

for pods from outer space.      

14:09.700 --> 14:11.700
         I wonder what          
     that's all about, huh?

14:13.400 --> 14:14.600
      that she just might       
        be a nice woman?

                Oh, yeah, right.

      are so chummy, huh?       

14:24.000 --> 14:25.500
Sorry, Sam. Can't talk about it.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.900
        Kind of private.

Oh, give me a break.

everything about me and Diane?  

14:35.200 --> 14:38.300

to thank me.                    

14:38.400 --> 14:40.900
I'm not really at liberty       
      to go into details.       

14:41.000 --> 14:42.300
    Suffice it to say,          

14:42.300 --> 14:45.200
          Miss Howe had a little
          personal crisis       

14:45.200 --> 14:46.500
            last night, okay?   

14:46.600 --> 14:48.500

    Real tears?                 

14:50.200 --> 14:52.900
You sure she didn't just        
pull a hair out of her nose?    

14:54.700 --> 14:56.400
                      No, Carla.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.300
     She got a little sad,      

14:57.400 --> 14:58.900
and I happened to be there      
        to comfort her.         

14:59.000 --> 15:00.700
            I think it really   
            just takes          

15:00.800 --> 15:02.700
                 a little warmth
                 and compassion,

15:02.800 --> 15:04.700
                and she warms   
                right up to you.

15:04.700 --> 15:07.100
Compassion, huh?

                 know next time.

Well, of course I will.

                 all right?

Yes, thank you very much.

of you to ask.

                  Is that right?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.900
    Well... you know, I'll      
    tell you something, lady.   

23:46.900 --> 23:49.200
There was a time when I was     
considering making love to you, 

23:49.300 --> 23:50.600
but now it's                    
out of the question.            

23:50.600 --> 23:52.900
As a matter of fact, you know,  
I wouldn't make love to you     

23:53.000 --> 23:54.200
if you asked me,                
if you begged me                

23:54.300 --> 23:55.600
to make love to you,            
I wouldn't.                     

23:55.600 --> 23:56.700
Go ahead, just ask me.          

23:56.700 --> 23:58.100
Just try it.                    
See what happens.               

23:58.100 --> 23:59.300
Would you make love to me?      

23:59.300 --> 24:00.900
Well, okay, but just once.
