WEBVTT

01:47.133 --> 01:48.467
- Vikings!

01:48.533 --> 01:51.200
The word alone conjures up
images of drunken hordes

01:51.266 --> 01:53.967
attacking and pillaging
defenseless villages

01:54.033 --> 01:56.967
from the shores of Britain
to the steps of Russia.

01:57.033 --> 01:57.967
But we've got a lot of
misconceptions

01:58.033 --> 02:00.100
about the Vikings.

02:00.166 --> 02:03.867
Example: they never actually
wore these stupid helmets,

02:03.934 --> 02:06.767
and because they had a limited
amount of land on which to farm,

02:06.834 --> 02:10.166
they only pillaged
to survive.

02:10.233 --> 02:11.633
- I want to follow you.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.567
You're the next wave and
I want to be your lieutenant.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.200
- Kill Guerra.

02:25.633 --> 02:27.066
- What the fuck you doing,
Jaime?

02:27.133 --> 02:29.533
- Sorry, bro, you gotta die.
That's just how it is.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.333
- Wait, at least
do me in the front.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.900
Let me die like a man.

02:40.533 --> 02:42.333
That's how it is,
right, bro?

02:54.600 --> 02:59.100
- Hey, father, I need
to make a confession.

02:59.166 --> 03:01.567
- Saturday, 3:00.

03:01.633 --> 03:03.834
- I need to make one now.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.800
- Close the door, Officer.

03:13.667 --> 03:16.100
What's up?

03:16.166 --> 03:19.667
- You know, ever since
I've been let out of solitary,

03:19.734 --> 03:22.200
I've just been going
right and left, you know,

03:22.266 --> 03:24.100
up and down.

03:24.166 --> 03:26.834
I'm just trying to prove
to everyone that I'm no pussy.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.767
- I know what you mean.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.367
I should have died
in that bus crash,

03:32.433 --> 03:37.533
and now the Reverend Cloutier
has disappeared,

03:37.600 --> 03:39.934
which I think is supposed
to mean something,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.233
but I can't figure out
what that something is.

03:44.300 --> 03:47.066
- So, what do you do?

03:47.133 --> 03:48.700
- Pray.

03:48.767 --> 03:50.800
- Yeah, well, you know,

03:50.867 --> 03:53.900
toss in a couple
of extra for me.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.266
- I always do, Miguel.

03:56.333 --> 03:57.834
- Yeah, well, I need
just a little bit more

03:57.900 --> 04:00.834
than my usual amount.

04:00.900 --> 04:04.500
Someone died
because of me.

04:04.567 --> 04:06.266
- Jaime Velez?

04:06.333 --> 04:08.033
- Yeah.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.934
This kid was innocent,
you know?

04:11.000 --> 04:16.033
- You and I have had a long
and battered relationship,

04:16.100 --> 04:19.800
but I continue to believe
that you have a good soul,

04:19.867 --> 04:21.200
and that you'll
find a way to right

04:21.266 --> 04:22.734
whatever wrong
you've committed.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.867
- And if I don't?

04:24.934 --> 04:27.500
- Then you really
are a pussy.

04:42.166 --> 04:43.834
- The problem
is in our state,

04:43.900 --> 04:45.567
there are more
visually-impaired people

04:45.633 --> 04:47.800
than there are guide dogs,
but there are more dogs

04:47.867 --> 04:49.734
than there are people
to train them.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.300
That's why I created this
program, "Man's Best Friend",

04:52.367 --> 04:54.967
where prisoners
do the training.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.200
- And it's worked
elsewhere, huh?

04:56.266 --> 04:58.166
- Oh, better than we'd hoped.

04:58.233 --> 05:00.433
- Sorry, am I late?

05:00.500 --> 05:03.533
- Well, she got here early,
so we just kind of dove in.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.667
- Sure, why wait
for little old me?

05:05.734 --> 05:08.467
- Alicia Hinden,
Eleanor O'Connor,

05:08.533 --> 05:09.800
the governor's liaison.

05:09.867 --> 05:11.000
- Nice to meet you.

05:11.066 --> 05:14.000
- Please, continue.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.567
- Having inmates care for
and train these pups

05:19.633 --> 05:21.467
has been a perfect match.

05:21.533 --> 05:24.166
60% of the dogs
qualify for placement,

05:24.233 --> 05:26.934
90% of the prisoners
demonstrate a better attitude

05:27.000 --> 05:29.934
after their participation
in the program.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.467
- Aren't there certain skills
necessary to train a guide dog?

05:33.533 --> 05:35.700
- Of course, but the skills
are teachable.

05:35.767 --> 05:38.100
- And the prisoners
don't harm the animals?

05:38.166 --> 05:39.467
- Well, we were worried
at first,

05:39.533 --> 05:41.700
but what's happened here
is the dogs

05:41.767 --> 05:44.066
bring out the best
in their trainers.

05:44.133 --> 05:47.500
Inmates go from having nothing
to nurturing a life.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.934
It means more to them
than you can know.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.734
- You'll pardon me, Ms. Hinden,
if I'm skeptical.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.333
I think we should start small.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.934
- Sure, the less people,
the less chance of success.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.800
- I'm not saying
the program will fail.

06:00.867 --> 06:02.767
- No, you're just trying
to guarantee it won't last.

06:02.834 --> 06:04.433
- I'm trying to save
time and money.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.166
- Yeah, right.
- Fuck you, Tim.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.333
- Actually, I prefer
to start small.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.667
- Oh.

06:09.734 --> 06:13.300
- So, I'll just need
three good volunteers.

06:13.367 --> 06:15.200
- If you're interested
let me know, but remember,

06:15.266 --> 06:17.934
this isn't a few weeks
of playing fetch.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.934
You gotta be strongly
motivated to participate.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.100
Now, the woman
running the program

06:23.166 --> 06:25.734
will interview each potential
candidate, review your files,

06:25.800 --> 06:28.333
and then make her final
decision, that's all.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.033
- Shit, man.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.033
I don't want
no dogs in here, man.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.567
You know,
where I grew up, man,

06:33.633 --> 06:36.734
there was this rott-pit bull
mix, mean motherfucker.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.500
I'm sure he had
some Schillinger in him.

06:38.567 --> 06:41.700
Fucking took a chunk
outta my leg, man.

06:41.767 --> 06:45.266
- Something tells me
you deserved to get bit.

06:45.333 --> 06:49.767
- Yo, maybe a dog would take
my mind off my problems.

06:49.834 --> 06:52.767
I'm signing up.

06:52.834 --> 06:54.333
- You know what,
I think I'm gonna apply.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.333
- I bet these mutts
are drug sniffers.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.467
- Undercover dogs?

06:57.533 --> 06:58.667
- Hey, you never know, man.

06:58.734 --> 07:00.433
- Fuck it, you know what?
I'm in, man.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.967
- Me, too.

07:03.033 --> 07:06.000
- Ryan?
- Yo.

07:06.066 --> 07:07.333
- Can we get a doggie?

07:07.400 --> 07:08.467
- Not a chance.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.500
- Come on in and sit down.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.066
- Hey, girl.

07:17.133 --> 07:21.200
Yeah, yeah.

07:21.266 --> 07:24.967
What'd you do to get in here
with us bastards, huh?

07:25.033 --> 07:27.266
- Miguel, I've looked
through your file,

07:27.333 --> 07:30.033
and I gotta
be honest with you,

07:30.100 --> 07:32.233
you're not really suited
for this program.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.567
- Why's that?

07:33.633 --> 07:35.934
- You've got quite
a history of violence.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.233
- You read in there
about the C.O. I blinded,

07:38.300 --> 07:39.667
Eugene Rivera?

07:43.166 --> 07:45.100
- Yeah, that kind of
jumped out at me.

07:45.166 --> 07:49.100
- Well, that's why
you gotta let me do this.

07:49.166 --> 07:51.400
It's what I owe.

07:51.467 --> 07:53.500
Just a good thing
to even out all the bad,

07:53.567 --> 07:56.500
you know
what I'm saying?

07:56.567 --> 07:58.233
Check this out.

07:58.300 --> 08:01.767
She already picked me.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.266
Yeah.

08:03.333 --> 08:06.367
Yeah,
good girl.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.166
- Oh, that's my bitch,
right there.

08:18.233 --> 08:20.433
- Step back a second, Penders.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.066
You don't get
your "bitch" just yet.

08:23.133 --> 08:24.367
This isn't
the city pound,

08:24.433 --> 08:26.400
so, I'll be assigning you
your dog,

08:26.467 --> 08:28.200
which is how
you'll refer to them.

08:28.266 --> 08:29.767
- You the bitch.

08:29.834 --> 08:32.934
- First let me run down what
we're going to accomplish here.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.100
The goal is to teach them,
and you, basic obedience.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.600
- So, if we
step out of line,

08:39.667 --> 08:42.700
then you hit us on the nose
with a rolled-up newspaper?

08:42.767 --> 08:44.700
- If I have to.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.800
- Now, you'll teach the dogs

08:46.867 --> 08:49.800
come, sit, stay--
the basics.

08:49.867 --> 08:54.033
But more importantly,
you'll show them love and trust.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.200
For these dogs to be useful
to the visually impaired,

08:56.266 --> 08:58.900
they have to be comfortable
not just with their owners,

08:58.967 --> 09:00.900
but with all people,

09:00.967 --> 09:02.800
and if we don't
accomplish that,

09:02.867 --> 09:05.500
then all you've raised is a pet,
just like any other schmo.

09:05.567 --> 09:07.066
Yes?

09:07.133 --> 09:08.400
- These dogs,
they stay with us?

09:08.467 --> 09:09.867
- Yes, in your pods.

09:09.934 --> 09:12.066
- How do you keep them safe
from the other prisoners?

09:12.133 --> 09:14.533
- Like I said,
love and trust.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.333
- Shit, now that's like
conjugals and cigarettes.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.834
- Meaning?
- Those are two things

09:19.900 --> 09:21.600
that don't exist in Oz.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.700
- Check it out, the boys
brought their dates home.

09:34.734 --> 09:37.467
- So, has your little mongrel
learned about pain yet?

09:37.533 --> 09:39.200
- You stay the fuck
away from her.

09:39.266 --> 09:42.266
- Oh, you afraid I'm gonna hurt
your little poochie-woochie?

09:45.367 --> 09:48.800
- I'm afraid she might
hurt you, bro.

09:48.867 --> 09:50.033
C'mon, girl.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.200
C'mon, get inside.

09:52.266 --> 09:56.166
This is your new home.

09:56.233 --> 09:59.233
Yeah, come over here.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.166
Got you, girl.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.500
- All Vikings were
not stupid brutes.

10:14.567 --> 10:16.100
They had moments of brilliance.

10:16.166 --> 10:18.233
They were such great
shipbuilders and sailors,

10:18.300 --> 10:21.900
that Leif Eriksson and his crew
landed in America first,

10:21.967 --> 10:25.800
some say traveling as far south
as New York harbor.

10:25.867 --> 10:28.500
Here's where
the true brilliance comes in.

10:28.567 --> 10:31.400
They took a look,
turned around and went home.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.867
- You sent 200 letters
to the station,

10:35.934 --> 10:38.867
protesting the cancellation
of "Miss Sally's Schoolyard"?

10:38.934 --> 10:40.266
- I wanted
the programmers to see

10:40.333 --> 10:42.100
there's a groundswell
of support,

10:42.166 --> 10:44.400
a grassroots demand
for the show to continue.

10:44.467 --> 10:46.300
- All from
the same address?

10:46.367 --> 10:48.667
- I just got this letter
from the station manager today.

10:48.734 --> 10:50.166
"Thank you for writing,"
blah, blah,

10:50.233 --> 10:51.700
"the exceptional educational
value of the program,"

10:51.767 --> 10:53.166
blah, blah,
"unfortunately,

10:53.233 --> 10:55.567
'Miss Sally's Schoolyard'
has ceased production."

10:55.633 --> 10:57.367
- Oh, I'm gonna miss
"Miss Sally".

10:57.433 --> 11:00.066
- Wait, "I'm happy to announce
Whitney Allen will be appearing

11:00.133 --> 11:03.233
"in a new exercise series
called, 'Sallycise.'

11:03.300 --> 11:06.367
We hope you enjoy it,
sincerely," blah.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.800
I wonder if my Norma will
have a job on the new show.

11:08.867 --> 11:10.600
- You still haven't heard
from her, huh?

11:10.667 --> 11:14.367
- No, but I live in expectation.

11:14.433 --> 11:16.000
Did you get ahold
of your son?

11:16.066 --> 11:17.033
- Yes.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.033
- And?

11:18.100 --> 11:20.033
- And, there is no and.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.300
- But, Bob, did you tell him
you plan to win the lottery,

11:22.367 --> 11:24.166
that you're gonna use the money
to save Alex, Jr.

11:24.233 --> 11:25.166
from the leukemia?

11:25.233 --> 11:26.934
- No.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.867
- Isn't that
why you phoned him?

11:28.934 --> 11:31.333
- Midway I decided I shouldn't
get the family's hopes up.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.633
- You're starting to doubt
you picked the winning numbers.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.233
- Of course not.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.767
My concern is I don't know
whether Officer Brass

11:37.834 --> 11:39.800
actually bought
the ticket for me.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.633
Officer Brass!

11:41.700 --> 11:44.633
Officer Brass?

11:44.700 --> 11:46.967
Officer Brass!

11:47.033 --> 11:48.734
- What?
What is it, Rebadow?

11:48.800 --> 11:50.934
- Did you buy
my Mightyball ticket?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.266
- What?

11:52.333 --> 11:53.867
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:01.233 --> 12:03.367
Hey.
- Dave, what are you doing here?

12:03.433 --> 12:05.734
I thought the Warden
had you assigned to cafeteria.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.700
- He does,
I'm on a break.

12:07.767 --> 12:09.333
Just wanted to see
how you guys are doing.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.300
I've got PMS.
I'm doing like shit.

12:12.367 --> 12:14.600
- Officer Brass,
good to see you.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.600
- Yeah, why's that?

12:16.667 --> 12:19.700
- Glynn's bringing more and more
nigger COs in here every day.

12:19.767 --> 12:22.667
In my book, any pale face
is a good pale face.

12:22.734 --> 12:25.433
- Let me ask you something.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.900
Were you around
the day I got cut?

12:26.967 --> 12:29.433
- No, me and Robson
were on work detail.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.600
Believe me,
if I'd have been here,

12:30.667 --> 12:32.133
I'd have pulled
that monkey off you.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.133
- So, you know which
monkey it was?

12:34.200 --> 12:35.934
- Who exactly?
No.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.734
I guarantee you
this, though,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.133
it wasn't a white man.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.300
- Hey, Brass.

12:40.367 --> 12:43.333
- Yeah?

12:43.400 --> 12:45.133
- You drink?

12:45.200 --> 12:48.400
- Why, you want to go
grab a couple of beers?

12:48.467 --> 12:53.300
- How about a blood, piss, shit,
puke cocktail, motherfucker?

12:53.367 --> 12:54.567
- Ah! Ah!

12:54.633 --> 12:55.867
- Fucker!

12:58.100 --> 13:00.500
- Ah! God! Son of a bitch!

13:13.600 --> 13:14.934
- How you feeling, Dave?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.066
- I'm fine, can I go?

13:17.133 --> 13:19.300
- Sure, just come back
in a week or so,

13:19.367 --> 13:21.166
and we'll do
all your blood work.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.200
It's important that we check
for everything, you know,

13:23.266 --> 13:27.300
hepatitis, TB, HIV,

13:27.367 --> 13:31.033
you know,
just to be safe.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.133
Dave...

13:36.266 --> 13:38.900
I always feel it's not
my place to say this,

13:38.967 --> 13:41.467
but when I think of
what can happen if I didn't,

13:41.533 --> 13:42.800
I know I'd hate myself.

13:42.867 --> 13:44.500
- Say what?

13:44.567 --> 13:48.233
- Do you have a girlfriend
or a sexual partner?

13:48.300 --> 13:49.667
- Kate.

13:49.734 --> 13:53.166
- You should mention
what happened.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.667
Just so she knows.

13:55.734 --> 14:00.467
- You're right,
it's not your place.

14:18.767 --> 14:21.800
both:

14:41.133 --> 14:42.967
- Stop that.

14:43.033 --> 14:45.266
Officer?

14:45.333 --> 14:46.433
- Problem?

14:46.500 --> 14:47.834
- He really should
be in the hospital.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.133
- No can do.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.533
- Look, I know he attacked
one of your own,

14:50.600 --> 14:52.667
but I can't treat him
properly here.

14:52.734 --> 14:54.133
- I have to check
with the Warden.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.433
- Then go check.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.033
Hurry.

15:02.767 --> 15:05.800
both:

15:13.433 --> 15:16.333
I said, stop it.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.100
I said, stop it!

15:20.166 --> 15:23.100
Stop it, stop it!
Stop it, stop it!

15:23.166 --> 15:26.233
I said, stop it,
don't touch me!

15:26.300 --> 15:29.433
Don't touch me!
What's the matter with you?!

15:29.500 --> 15:31.333
Martinez
kept touching me,

15:31.400 --> 15:35.133
and I had these flashes
back to the rape,

15:35.200 --> 15:38.433
and then I just lost control.

15:38.500 --> 15:43.633
- Or maybe at the moment,
you were actually in control.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.967
- Peter Marie,
I beat an injured man.

15:46.033 --> 15:48.433
- Yes, I know,
but by beating him,

15:48.500 --> 15:51.200
you were finally
in charge of the situation.

15:51.266 --> 15:54.200
Look, you've told me
on any number of occasions

15:54.266 --> 15:55.767
that since the rape,
you feel adrift.

15:55.834 --> 15:59.066
Well, maybe this incident today
was an attempt to

15:59.133 --> 16:01.400
regain control of your life.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.867
- Well, all I keep having
are incidents like these.

16:03.934 --> 16:06.367
Are you saying I antagonize
these men on purpose?

16:06.433 --> 16:07.767
- No, no, no, no.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.667
But I do think you have
to answer a question

16:09.734 --> 16:12.367
I asked you when
you first returned to work.

16:12.433 --> 16:14.700
Why?

16:14.767 --> 16:17.467
Why, after being beaten
and violated,

16:17.533 --> 16:22.700
did you choose to return to
a place filled with brutal men?

16:22.767 --> 16:26.433
- Oh, I still don't know.

16:26.500 --> 16:30.900
- Well, I think if we work on it
and if we figure it out,

16:30.967 --> 16:32.867
you'll finally
start to heal.

16:36.266 --> 16:38.233
- According to Norse mythology,

16:38.300 --> 16:41.500
man was made from an ash tree
and woman from an adder.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.734
The great god Odin
gave them both life and souls

16:44.800 --> 16:47.266
and a place to live
called Midgard,

16:47.333 --> 16:51.834
which Odin created from
the eyebrows of a giant he slew.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.000
Sounds almost true, don't it?

16:54.066 --> 16:55.433
All of us...

16:55.500 --> 16:59.133
Living on the edge
of an eyebrow.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.900
- Homosexuality?

17:02.967 --> 17:05.867
It's a perversion
against God's will.

17:05.934 --> 17:07.700
- I agree.

17:07.767 --> 17:10.767
- And yet, you've practiced
sodomy yourself.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.367
- I'm no faggot.

17:12.433 --> 17:16.100
- You've raped Beecher
and Cyril O'Reily,

17:16.166 --> 17:17.800
and God knows
how many others.

17:17.867 --> 17:19.667
- I never touched anybody.

17:19.734 --> 17:22.400
- You lying, cocksucking fuck.
- Tobias--

17:22.467 --> 17:24.100
- How can you deny
what you did?

17:24.166 --> 17:25.767
Get the fuck up!
- Tobias! Officer!

17:25.834 --> 17:26.767
- Get your fucking
hands off me!

17:26.834 --> 17:28.367
- Stop it!
- Come on!

17:28.433 --> 17:31.967
- You fucking lying bitch!
You lying fucking sack of shit!

17:48.500 --> 17:51.200
- Hey there, Petey.

17:51.266 --> 17:53.567
You having some shrink time?
That's good.

17:53.633 --> 17:57.133
After a trauma
like you went through,

17:57.200 --> 17:58.500
getting gang raped and all...

18:04.367 --> 18:07.567
- It's healthy to talk
about the experience.

18:07.633 --> 18:11.467
You probably shouldn't get too
specific in the details, though.

18:11.533 --> 18:14.967
That might not be
so healthy after all.

18:15.033 --> 18:16.734
- Leave me alone.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.734
- Sure.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.166
For now.

18:22.233 --> 18:23.967
Keep your
sunny side up.

18:29.333 --> 18:32.066
- Hello, Chris.

18:32.133 --> 18:35.767
How are you?

18:35.834 --> 18:37.300
- Well, I'll tell you,
being alone

18:37.367 --> 18:40.367
gives you an awful lot
of time to think.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.533
I'm sitting here
thinking about irony,

18:42.600 --> 18:44.633
the irony of my life.

18:44.700 --> 18:48.433
- I'm sorry I can't convince the
Warden to let you see Beecher.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.133
He's not even allowing
an exchange of letters.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.000
- I'll tell you,
it was easier being apart

18:53.066 --> 18:54.467
when I was
in Massachusetts.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.066
Knowing he's
in this building...

18:59.133 --> 19:01.633
Knowing that maybe
he's behind that wall...

19:06.200 --> 19:08.433
You said you were
gonna talk to a lawyer,

19:08.500 --> 19:11.567
get a defense lawyer
for me.

19:11.633 --> 19:13.633
Because I'll tell you,
the only way I'm seeing Beecher

19:13.700 --> 19:15.166
is if I beat
this murder rap.

19:15.233 --> 19:17.166
- I'll know
something shortly.

19:17.233 --> 19:19.834
Meanwhile,
keep the faith.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.200
- Keep it where?

19:32.266 --> 19:33.200
- Hey.

19:33.266 --> 19:35.433
- Hey.

19:35.500 --> 19:39.300
What a nice surprise.

19:39.367 --> 19:41.100
- My cell phone never
seems to work in here,

19:41.166 --> 19:43.500
so I asked Sister Peter Marie
if I could use her phone.

19:46.166 --> 19:47.934
I was talking to Freddy Rudolph
about his hearing

19:48.000 --> 19:50.533
when Sister asked if I could
speak with another prisoner...

19:53.800 --> 19:57.133
Chris Keller.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.100
- What?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.200
Don't.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.367
- Why?

20:02.433 --> 20:03.567
- Just don't.

20:03.633 --> 20:05.066
- I've heard so many legends
about Keller,

20:05.133 --> 20:06.834
I'm curious.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.700
- Catherine...

20:12.800 --> 20:14.800
I love you.

20:14.867 --> 20:17.700
- And you love Keller, right?

20:17.767 --> 20:19.767
I mean, you still
love Keller, don't you?

20:19.834 --> 20:22.133
- If you meet him...

20:24.200 --> 20:25.734
He's very seductive.

20:25.800 --> 20:30.000
You--you're gonna fall
in love with him, too.

20:31.734 --> 20:34.667
- I'm willing
to take that chance.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.633
Besides, I can't
pass up the opportunity

20:36.700 --> 20:39.800
to meet my boyfriend's
boyfriend.

20:39.867 --> 20:41.967
- Here you go, Keller.

20:42.033 --> 20:45.066
Bag of atomic fireballs,
per your request.

20:45.133 --> 20:46.967
- Thanks, Claire.

20:47.033 --> 20:49.900
You know, I always need
a little something to suck on.

20:49.967 --> 20:51.900
- Warden finds out
I smuggled them in for you,

20:51.967 --> 20:53.333
and he'll have my ass.

20:53.400 --> 20:58.667
- Mmm, what a great ass it is.

20:58.734 --> 21:00.633
- You're bad.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.800
- So, spank me.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.667
- You got a visitor, Keller.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.834
- Hello.

21:14.900 --> 21:18.333
- I'm Catherine McClain from the
Alliance for Prisoner Rights.

21:18.400 --> 21:22.467
Sister Peter Marie
asked me to stop by.

21:22.533 --> 21:23.800
Can we be alone?

21:23.867 --> 21:25.567
- We'll be right outside.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.800
- Did you kill
those three men?

21:32.800 --> 21:35.233
You get right to the point,
don't you?

21:35.300 --> 21:37.367
- You don't have
a lot of time.

21:37.433 --> 21:38.900
- I've got nothing but time.

21:38.967 --> 21:40.500
- Maybe not.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.633
You're facing
the death penalty.

21:45.767 --> 21:49.734
- I'm not afraid to die.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.934
I just want to die
for the right reason.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.800
- And the right reason
would be...

21:53.867 --> 21:57.600
- Love.

21:57.667 --> 22:00.100
- We have a mutual friend.

22:00.166 --> 22:01.133
- Yeah, who?

22:01.200 --> 22:04.200
- Tobias Beecher.

22:04.266 --> 22:07.533
- Oh, wait.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.734
I know who you are.

22:09.800 --> 22:13.767
You're the one who tried
to help Toby with his parole.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.233
- Yes.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.734
- And he wrote me
about you.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.066
- Yeah, what did he say?

22:23.433 --> 22:25.233
- He loves you.

22:25.300 --> 22:29.233
- Well, you understand
my dilemma now.

22:29.300 --> 22:31.767
You see, if you fry,

22:31.834 --> 22:35.033
you're a memory.

22:35.100 --> 22:38.400
If I get you off,
you and Toby will be reunited.

22:38.467 --> 22:39.834
- So now I know you'll do
everything in your power

22:39.900 --> 22:41.500
to get me off.

22:41.567 --> 22:42.767
- And why's that?

22:42.834 --> 22:46.533
- Because if you love Toby
as much as I do,

22:46.600 --> 22:49.700
then you'll want him
to be happy.

22:49.767 --> 22:54.467
Reuniting us
will make him happy.

22:54.533 --> 22:57.567
- Yeah.

22:57.633 --> 23:00.967
- Counselor?

23:01.033 --> 23:03.100
- Did you kill
those three men?

23:03.166 --> 23:04.867
- No.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.500
- No, no!

23:13.000 --> 23:15.266
- Shut the fuck up!

23:15.333 --> 23:16.567
You fucking cunt!

23:19.633 --> 23:20.734
Come on! You want it?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.066
- Let me go!

23:30.133 --> 23:35.700
- Prisoner numbers 0-2-G-5-6-1
and 0-2-W-5-6-2,

23:35.767 --> 23:38.266
Adam Guenzel
and Franklin Winthrop,

23:38.333 --> 23:40.433
convicted
January 14th, 2002,

23:40.500 --> 23:43.133
rape, attempted murder
in the first degree.

23:43.200 --> 23:47.934
Sentence, 28 years,
up for parole in seven.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.467
- Okay, let's go!

23:51.467 --> 23:52.834
Come on.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.266
- Come on over here, boy!

24:30.900 --> 24:32.767
- That one's yours.

24:32.834 --> 24:36.300
- This'll be the first time
I ever had to make my own bed.

24:36.367 --> 24:39.133
- Adam, take my word,
nothing you experienced

24:39.200 --> 24:42.500
growing up in Broun Park
has prepared you for life in Oz.

24:44.133 --> 24:45.834
I know it's hard,

24:45.900 --> 24:49.667
but I'll be here for you,
I promise.

24:49.734 --> 24:52.367
Your dad was my scoutmaster,
for God's sake.

24:52.433 --> 24:55.500
- You have
to understand something.

24:55.567 --> 24:58.100
That girl Franklin and I raped,

24:58.166 --> 24:59.867
we were drunk,

24:59.934 --> 25:03.900
all three of us,
partying.

25:03.967 --> 25:06.433
I blacked out.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.000
I never meant
to hurt her.

25:08.066 --> 25:10.633
- Yeah, but you did.

25:10.700 --> 25:12.800
That's why you're standing
where you're standing.

25:12.867 --> 25:16.000
Don't forget that, ever.

25:16.066 --> 25:19.633
The guilt
may keep you sane.

25:19.700 --> 25:20.834
Get settled,

25:20.900 --> 25:23.533
and I'll introduce
you around.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.934
- Yo, you need a helping
hand there, pretty boy?

25:41.734 --> 25:44.066
You ever
suck cock before?

25:44.133 --> 25:46.934
- Back off, Clarence.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.233
- Alright, Vern,
no need to get testy.

25:57.066 --> 26:00.300
- You okay?

26:00.367 --> 26:02.467
- He was gonna rape me.

26:02.533 --> 26:04.834
- Fucking nigger.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.734
- We'll protect you
from now on.

26:06.800 --> 26:07.800
You'll be safe.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.567
- Jesus, thanks.

26:09.633 --> 26:12.767
- But, like everything else
in life,

26:12.834 --> 26:15.066
it's gonna cost.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.400
- You've got an alcohol problem,

26:25.467 --> 26:27.700
so you should join
Sister Pete's therapy.

26:30.367 --> 26:32.166
- Fucking Christ.

26:32.233 --> 26:33.500
- What?

26:33.567 --> 26:34.867
- Remember that friend,
Franklin Winthrop,

26:34.934 --> 26:36.533
I was telling you about?
- Yeah.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.867
- That's him.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.700
Franklin.

26:43.767 --> 26:46.367
- Your boy's next.

26:52.133 --> 26:54.200
- Fuck!

26:57.700 --> 26:59.367
- I need your help.

26:59.433 --> 27:03.600
I need you to protect Adam
from the Aryans.

27:03.667 --> 27:05.734
- I can't.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.834
- What do you mean, you can't?

27:07.900 --> 27:10.500
- Beecher, when I stabbed

27:10.567 --> 27:14.233
Schillinger and Robson
defending you,

27:14.300 --> 27:18.066
I put a lot of
my Muslim brothers in jeopardy.

27:18.133 --> 27:19.200
- I know.

27:19.266 --> 27:21.333
- So, I can't do that again,

27:21.400 --> 27:26.567
certainly not over some boy
who rapes and beats women.

27:26.633 --> 27:30.433
- I know Adam's no angel,

27:30.500 --> 27:32.166
but I've known him
since he was a child.

27:32.233 --> 27:33.500
I know his family.

27:33.567 --> 27:35.533
I can't justify
what he did, but I--

27:35.600 --> 27:37.867
- Beecher, stop.

27:37.934 --> 27:39.934
My answer is no.

27:51.867 --> 27:53.000
- Well?

27:53.066 --> 27:54.900
It's not gonna work.

27:54.967 --> 27:57.467
- Shit!

27:57.533 --> 28:00.000
- Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

28:00.066 --> 28:02.433
As a temporary stopgap,
you're gonna go to McManus

28:02.500 --> 28:03.867
and request a stay
in Protective Custody.

28:03.934 --> 28:05.133
- Until when?

28:05.200 --> 28:07.100
- Until I can figure
something else out.

28:11.467 --> 28:13.133
Fuck.

28:29.233 --> 28:30.934
- He's mine.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.367
Clean him up.

28:49.066 --> 28:52.033
- Prisoner number 0-2-U-6-7-2,

28:52.100 --> 28:55.734
Francis Urbano,
AKA Frank the Fixer,

28:55.800 --> 28:58.500
convicted
January 7th, 2002,

28:58.567 --> 29:00.633
murder in
the first degree.

29:00.700 --> 29:02.367
Sentence, life.

29:02.433 --> 29:05.734
Up for parole in 25 years.

29:14.667 --> 29:17.400
- Sister Peter Marie wanted me
to drop this off for Dr. Nathan.

29:30.100 --> 29:33.767
- Pancamo, you look like shit.

29:33.834 --> 29:36.433
- I got a fever
or something.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.934
Can you hand me
some water?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.333
- Yeah, sure.

29:42.200 --> 29:45.834
You know, I know you hate the
Aryans as much as I do, right?

29:45.900 --> 29:47.900
- More.

29:47.967 --> 29:51.867
Those Nazi fucks shanked me
and raped Petey Schibetta.

29:51.934 --> 29:54.900
- Well, I got a friend who
they've threatened to rape, too.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.233
I was wondering if you could
do something to protect him.

29:57.300 --> 29:59.533
- Beecher,
what are you doing?

29:59.600 --> 30:01.033
- Nothing.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.100
- Do it somewhere else.

30:02.166 --> 30:03.500
- Yes, sir.

30:03.567 --> 30:04.500
What do you say?

30:04.567 --> 30:06.867
- Done.
- Thank you.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.033
- Ooh, I like a man who sweats.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.166
- Leave him alone.

30:23.233 --> 30:24.567
- Stay out of this, prag.

30:24.633 --> 30:27.300
So there's two ways this
could go, precious,

30:27.367 --> 30:29.300
kick or kiss.

30:29.367 --> 30:30.934
They both end the same,

30:31.000 --> 30:32.734
with my dick up your ass.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.066
- Not necessarily.

30:35.133 --> 30:38.266
- Oh, who the fuck
are you?

30:38.333 --> 30:41.133
- Who the fuck am I?

30:57.800 --> 30:59.266
- You guinea piece of shit.

30:59.333 --> 31:00.967
- Fuck you!

31:03.633 --> 31:06.066
- How's the wound,
you fuckin' guinea? Huh?

31:08.433 --> 31:10.033
- Lockdown!

31:30.200 --> 31:32.600
- Man, oh man, I was
so fucking terrified.

31:32.667 --> 31:34.200
- I know.

31:34.266 --> 31:37.166
- I mean, there were arms and
legs and knives everywhere.

31:37.233 --> 31:38.734
- Yeah, well,
it's over now.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.934
- Damn, Jesus, I didn't know
which way to turn.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.700
I mean, I was so pumped,

31:43.767 --> 31:46.667
part of me wanted to jump
right in and kick some ass.

31:46.734 --> 31:48.667
- Adam...
- I could've, you know.

31:48.734 --> 31:50.333
I could've kicked
some royal ass.

31:52.300 --> 31:53.934
Fuck!

31:57.734 --> 31:59.266
- The Vikings had
a code of behavior

31:59.333 --> 32:01.400
which they followed
religiously.

32:01.467 --> 32:02.800
Honor and valor
on the battlefield

32:02.867 --> 32:05.834
were the values that
a warrior strived for.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.233
But much like
the men in Oz,

32:07.300 --> 32:09.467
they had no concept
of good and evil.

32:09.533 --> 32:11.433
They couldn't tell
the difference.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.433
They didn't know
there should be one.

32:17.033 --> 32:19.100
- Hey, Gloria,
I heard what happened.

32:19.166 --> 32:21.033
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.166
- That's good.

32:23.233 --> 32:24.467
- Come in.

32:28.166 --> 32:30.000
I met your mother.

32:30.066 --> 32:31.967
- Yeah, I know, she told me.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.467
- She seems nice.

32:34.533 --> 32:38.767
- She's so completely different
than the woman I grew up

32:38.834 --> 32:41.433
thinking was my real mom,
my other mom,

32:41.500 --> 32:43.433
Cyril's mom, Tessie.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.967
That was her first name,
Tessie.

32:46.033 --> 32:48.133
Growing up,
Tessie was always sobbing.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.333
She had good reason,
you know, Cyril and I,

32:51.400 --> 32:54.867
we never gave her
any cause to smile.

32:54.934 --> 32:56.300
It's crazy, though.

32:56.367 --> 32:57.367
- What?

32:57.433 --> 32:59.400
- Now that
my mom is here,

32:59.467 --> 33:01.834
you know, doing this
community service,

33:01.900 --> 33:05.767
well, she
and me and Cyril,

33:05.834 --> 33:07.800
it's like we're
a family, you know?

33:07.867 --> 33:11.967
It's fucking great.

33:12.033 --> 33:14.066
- Ryan, have you

33:14.133 --> 33:16.700
told her anything about

33:16.767 --> 33:18.533
what went on

33:18.600 --> 33:20.000
between you and me,

33:20.066 --> 33:23.433
Cyril, my husband, Keenan?

33:23.500 --> 33:24.900
- No, uh-uh.

33:24.967 --> 33:26.433
Uh-uh, I mean,
she's been asking, but...

33:26.500 --> 33:27.734
- Don't you think
you should?

33:27.800 --> 33:29.100
- Why?

33:29.166 --> 33:30.800
What good would it do her
knowing that shit?

33:30.867 --> 33:32.900
- You can't just present the
good son

33:32.967 --> 33:34.100
side of yourself to her.

33:34.166 --> 33:35.600
- Look, Gloria, I'm in Oz.

33:35.667 --> 33:37.200
You know, I don't
think my mom thinks

33:37.266 --> 33:38.834
I'm up for
any sainthood.

33:38.900 --> 33:42.500
- If you want to have
a real relationship with her,

33:42.567 --> 33:44.100
you have to tell her
the whole truth.

33:44.166 --> 33:45.567
- Uh-uh, I can't tell her
the whole truth.

33:45.633 --> 33:46.834
- Why not?

33:46.900 --> 33:48.800
- Because then
she'll stop loving me.

33:51.767 --> 33:53.533
- I don't think so.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.767
In my experience,

33:59.834 --> 34:02.867
you don't love
Ryan O'Reily by choice.

34:13.500 --> 34:18.600
- ♪ Old McDonald had a farm ♪

34:18.667 --> 34:21.133
♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪

34:21.200 --> 34:22.934
- Relax, relax.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.734
- ♪ And on that farm
he had some cars ♪

34:27.800 --> 34:31.567
- Cars?
- ♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪

34:31.633 --> 34:34.033
♪ With a vroom,
vroom here ♪

34:34.100 --> 34:35.834
- That's not bad, kid.

34:35.900 --> 34:38.500
- Don't laugh,
at least I'm trying.

34:38.567 --> 34:39.834
- Yeah, he's right.

34:39.900 --> 34:42.166
I don't see you
making any effort.

34:42.233 --> 34:43.433
- I got a little
something-something

34:43.500 --> 34:44.767
I might bust out
at the variety show.

34:44.834 --> 34:47.200
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

34:47.266 --> 34:49.834
- What's that?
- You'll see.

34:49.900 --> 34:52.600
Hey, Ma, I want
to ask you something.

34:52.667 --> 34:56.700
Do you think families need to be
100% honest with each other?

34:58.533 --> 35:00.433
- Yeah.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.867
Well, I mean, if your father
and I had been honest,

35:02.934 --> 35:04.633
if we'd been open,

35:04.700 --> 35:07.000
and if we'd worked
through our problems

35:07.066 --> 35:10.133
and all our fears,

35:10.200 --> 35:12.433
maybe I wouldn't have left.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.200
- I think about how different
my life would've gone,

35:14.266 --> 35:15.700
if the two of you'd
stayed married.

35:15.767 --> 35:18.300
- Yeah, well,
don't romanticize it, honey.

35:18.367 --> 35:19.734
It still would've been
really difficult.

35:19.800 --> 35:20.800
- No, I know that.

35:20.867 --> 35:22.100
But, you know,
we would've been,

35:22.166 --> 35:25.367
you know...
Together.

35:25.433 --> 35:26.767
- Yeah.

35:26.834 --> 35:30.633
- After we're done
fucking around here...

35:30.700 --> 35:32.600
I want to tell you about
some of the things

35:32.667 --> 35:35.066
that I've done,
you know...

35:35.133 --> 35:38.667
Since I've been in Oz.

35:38.734 --> 35:42.166
And I just...
I want to warn you, Mom,

35:42.233 --> 35:44.300
it's not pretty.

35:44.367 --> 35:47.000
- Well, I wouldn't
expect it to be.

35:47.066 --> 35:49.200
But that's good, because
maybe if you tell me about it,

35:49.266 --> 35:53.000
it'll start to make
some sense to you.

35:53.066 --> 35:54.633
- Yeah.

35:54.700 --> 35:58.000
- So, what do you got?

35:58.066 --> 36:00.066
- Just a little
somethin'-somethin'.

36:00.133 --> 36:01.266
- Let's see it.

36:15.133 --> 36:16.834
That's great.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.433
- Today's the day.

36:28.500 --> 36:29.967
- Yeah.

36:30.033 --> 36:31.166
- Kill 'em both.

36:31.233 --> 36:34.600
But if you could
only get one, get Ryan.

36:34.667 --> 36:38.000
We can always whack the 'tard
once the older brother's dead.

36:38.066 --> 36:40.233
- There's Schupe.

36:45.266 --> 36:47.200
- Hey, O'Reily.
- Not now, Schupe.

36:47.266 --> 36:49.000
- It's important.

36:49.066 --> 36:50.900
- Okay, you got 10 seconds,
what is it?

36:50.967 --> 36:52.433
- I overheard Li
talking to Jia.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.967
They were arguing
about your mom.

36:55.033 --> 36:56.066
- What?

36:56.133 --> 36:57.700
- Li was saying
he's gonna rape her.

36:57.767 --> 36:59.300
- Fuck.

36:59.367 --> 37:00.567
- You got any tits, man?

37:00.633 --> 37:03.400
- Yeah.

37:03.467 --> 37:06.066
- Ryan, is that man
gonna hurt Ma?

37:06.133 --> 37:07.934
- No fucking chance, Cyril.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.600
Whoa, so your boy's
gonna hurt my mom, huh?

37:11.667 --> 37:14.000
- He's out of control, O'Reily.
I don't know what to do.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.000
- Yeah, well, I do.

37:17.900 --> 37:19.066
Hey!

37:44.567 --> 37:47.166
I'm telling you,
he was gonna rape my mother.

37:47.233 --> 37:48.333
- You have proof of that?

37:48.400 --> 37:49.800
- Ask Jia,
he knows all about it.

37:49.867 --> 37:50.934
- I will.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.500
- Meanwhile, I want Cyril
in solitary.

37:52.567 --> 37:54.000
- No.

37:54.066 --> 37:56.133
- Li's just the latest in a long
line of people Cyril's hurt.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.233
I want him somewhere he's not
gonna hurt anybody else.

37:59.300 --> 38:02.367
- Hey, he's all yours.
- Ryan?

38:02.433 --> 38:03.834
- It's gonna be okay,
Cyril, it's gonna be okay.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.700
Be gentle with him,
man, come on.

38:05.767 --> 38:07.367
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

38:07.433 --> 38:09.266
- I'm sorry!
- You cocksucker!

38:09.333 --> 38:10.934
- Save your anger, O'Reily.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.500
This time we're gonna
go the distance.

38:12.567 --> 38:15.667
Cyril either ends up in
the insane asylum or death row.

38:15.734 --> 38:17.567
- And you're going
to the cage, come on.

38:17.633 --> 38:19.233
Come on, O'Reily,
let's go.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.400
- Sister, come on!

38:20.467 --> 38:22.233
Sister, you gotta believe me!

38:22.300 --> 38:25.867
- You know, it's just possible
he's telling the truth.

38:25.934 --> 38:28.500
- O'Reily, the truth?
I doubt it.

38:28.567 --> 38:29.867
- Please!

38:29.934 --> 38:32.467
Please!
I'm sorry!

38:32.533 --> 38:36.133
I'm sorry, please,
I don't want to go in there.

38:36.200 --> 38:39.367
No, no, please!

38:39.433 --> 38:42.333
I'm sorry, please!

38:42.400 --> 38:47.100
No, please,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

38:47.166 --> 38:50.967
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

38:51.033 --> 38:54.133
I'm sorry.

38:59.166 --> 39:01.033
- Hey, Jia, Jia, Jia,
come here, hey, come here.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.633
Hey, look, you gotta
go to McManus

39:02.700 --> 39:04.233
and tell him that Li
was gonna rape my ma, okay?

39:04.300 --> 39:05.633
- I got nothing
to say, O'Reily.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.233
- Whoa, whoa,
Jia, Jia, come on.

39:07.300 --> 39:08.700
Come on, come on,
you gotta do that for me, man.

39:08.767 --> 39:09.867
You gotta tell him.

39:09.934 --> 39:12.600
- Your brother's gonna die.

39:12.667 --> 39:14.300
They're gonna
fry his white ass,

39:14.367 --> 39:16.100
and I'm gonna be
sitting in the front row,

39:16.166 --> 39:19.200
laughing my balls off,
you fucking mick.

39:19.266 --> 39:21.633
- What, you fucking chink
motherfucker!

39:21.700 --> 39:24.667
You fucking kidding me?
You're fucking dead, Jia!

39:24.734 --> 39:26.467
You're fucking dead, you
rice-eating,

39:26.533 --> 39:27.900
little fucking bitch!

39:27.967 --> 39:29.400
You're fucking dead!

39:29.467 --> 39:32.600
You're fucking dead,
you fucking chink motherfucker!

39:40.700 --> 39:41.633
- You wanted to see me?

39:41.700 --> 39:44.367
- Yeah, Warden.

39:44.433 --> 39:46.100
Nice place you got here.

39:46.166 --> 39:49.233
- What do you want, Redding?

39:49.300 --> 39:51.333
- Control of
the cafeteria.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.667
- The Sicilians run
the cafeteria.

39:53.734 --> 39:56.133
- Yeah, but Chucky Pancamo's
still in the hospital,

39:56.200 --> 39:57.934
Pete Schibetta, psycho ward.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.934
The place is out of control.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.033
- Hmm, you think you can pull
the operation back together?

40:03.100 --> 40:04.967
- Well, most of those guys
are friends of mine.

40:05.033 --> 40:07.166
Most of them are black
and they don't take too kindly

40:07.233 --> 40:09.700
to kowtowing
to the dagos.

40:09.767 --> 40:12.834
- I let Adebisi call
the shots in the cafeteria.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.433
It was a disaster.

40:14.500 --> 40:16.467
- I ain't Adebisi, am I?

40:19.000 --> 40:22.900
- The truth is, there have been
a lot of fuck-ups

40:22.967 --> 40:27.133
all the way back
to the gas explosion.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.533
Alright, Redding,
I'll give you a chance.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.734
Officer!

40:31.800 --> 40:33.300
- One other thing...

40:33.367 --> 40:37.033
I'd appreciate it if you got
them Sicilians out of there.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.734
- Sure.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.600
- Much obliged.

40:44.533 --> 40:49.900
- Augustus, Augustus.

40:55.233 --> 40:57.767
- Augustus, where's your dog?

40:57.834 --> 40:59.100
- She's in my pod.

40:59.166 --> 41:01.934
I don't feel like
playing with her right now.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.533
- Thinking about your mother?

41:03.600 --> 41:04.767
- Yeah, believe it or not,

41:04.834 --> 41:06.266
it's gonna take more
than a few weeks for me

41:06.333 --> 41:07.500
to get over her death.

41:07.567 --> 41:08.900
- That's not what I meant.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.800
- I just keep picturing her,
trying to figure out

41:10.867 --> 41:13.834
which way is up
as the fucking bus rolls.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.500
She hated closed spaces,
being trapped,

41:16.567 --> 41:18.834
freaked her out.

41:18.900 --> 41:22.200
Now she's trapped forever
in some cheap-ass coffin.

41:22.266 --> 41:24.100
- You gotta move beyond that.

41:24.166 --> 41:25.567
- Fuck you, Beecher.

41:25.633 --> 41:28.033
- I know what you're feeling,
I buried my son.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.633
You know,
this may sound strange,

41:29.700 --> 41:31.567
but you gotta
work those images.

41:31.633 --> 41:32.967
Your mind's already taken
your mother

41:33.033 --> 41:34.333
from the bus to the grave.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.900
Now keep going.

41:35.967 --> 41:38.400
You gotta picture her body
under the ground rotting away.

41:38.467 --> 41:42.433
- Get the fuck out of my f--
- Listen to me.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.533
You have to imagine
your mother decaying,

41:44.600 --> 41:46.133
the maggots
eating away at her flesh,

41:46.200 --> 41:47.400
leaving nothing
but the bone.

41:47.467 --> 41:48.834
You gotta hear
the coffin splinter.

41:48.900 --> 41:51.367
You gotta smell the dirt
falling through the cracks.

41:51.433 --> 41:53.633
- And why the fuck
would I want to do that?

41:53.700 --> 41:55.433
- To let your mother go.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.133
Right now she's defined
by her death.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.200
This is the only way to lose
the horror of what happened,

42:00.266 --> 42:02.734
and to move on
to everything good about her.

42:02.800 --> 42:03.900
- I can't, you fuck!

42:03.967 --> 42:06.233
All I can see
is the fucking bus!

42:06.300 --> 42:08.233
Just take a walk, Beecher!
- Augustus--

42:08.300 --> 42:11.800
- Take a fucking walk!

42:11.867 --> 42:14.000
Jesus!

42:23.000 --> 42:24.867
- Give me that shit, man.

42:24.934 --> 42:26.533
Yeah.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.066
Yeah, let him in.

42:34.100 --> 42:36.033
- Give me something.

42:36.100 --> 42:38.000
- Some of this?

42:38.066 --> 42:39.166
- Yeah.

42:39.233 --> 42:41.300
- Word.
Why the change of vein?

42:41.367 --> 42:43.567
- I need
a consolation prize.

42:51.300 --> 42:53.333
- Yeah, welcome back.

42:56.100 --> 43:01.333
- Yo, this motherfucker
ain't done tits in like years.

You ain't gonna
begrudge me of that?

44:46.867 --> 44:48.133
- All I'm asking you,
Omar,

44:48.200 --> 44:50.767
is to keep the song
in  your heart.

44:54.367 --> 44:57.433
- Yo, White,
you take requests?

44:57.500 --> 44:58.600

what you want to hear?

44:58.667 --> 45:00.266

motherfucker.

45:13.066 --> 45:15.166

- Or what?

45:15.233 --> 45:16.233
- All right, break up
the square dance,

45:16.300 --> 45:18.166
Come on,
as in right fuckin' now!

45:18.233 --> 45:20.266
- Tell Mr. Bojangles,
keep his fuckin' trap shut!

45:20.333 --> 45:21.900
- Get the fuck
out of here now.

45:21.967 --> 45:25.066
Move it.

45:25.133 --> 45:27.200

looking out, man.

45:27.266 --> 45:29.200
- Stay out of trouble, Omar.

45:29.266 --> 45:30.834
- Yo, hey, wait, wait,
let me tell you something,

45:30.900 --> 45:32.767
for the first time
in my life,

45:32.834 --> 45:34.300
me and trouble ain't even
on speaking terms.

45:34.367 --> 45:35.600
- Then what was up
with Guerra?

45:35.667 --> 45:37.300
- He stepped to me,
you saw that.

45:37.367 --> 45:39.834
- Stop the finger-pointing,
Omar.

45:39.900 --> 45:43.333
All blame lies with you.

45:43.400 --> 45:46.500
And, therefore, on me,
and I am not gonna have it.

45:46.567 --> 45:50.934
- Mr. Said, I gotta practice.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.367
I mean, practice
is gonna make me perfect.

45:54.433 --> 45:56.467
- Then when trouble comes,
run away.

45:56.533 --> 45:58.867
- That ain't gonna help
my reputation up here at Oz.

45:58.934 --> 46:02.567

reputation matters with is me!

46:02.633 --> 46:03.767

46:03.834 --> 46:05.166
you go straight back to

He's following instructions
without too much whining.

46:30.667 --> 46:34.166
I have managed
to keep him clean.

46:34.233 --> 46:36.633
The singing...

46:36.700 --> 46:38.800
Seems to have
focused him, it's just...

46:38.867 --> 46:40.700
- He's driving you crazy.

46:40.767 --> 46:43.567
- No, the problem is
he's catching a lot of flack

46:43.633 --> 46:45.500
from the other inmates.

46:45.567 --> 46:48.200
They're harassing him,
and he may get hurt, McManus.

46:48.266 --> 46:49.900
There's only so much
that I can do.

46:49.967 --> 46:53.200
He doesn't have anywhere else
to practice except in my pod.

46:53.266 --> 46:54.900
- Which is when
he drives you crazy.

46:54.967 --> 46:56.133
- Yes.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.834
I don't know if there
are any other options.

46:57.900 --> 46:59.900
I want to support him

47:24.567 --> 47:26.300

47:33.367 --> 47:35.200
Yo, you want to hear

And as a matter of fact, Omar,
neither does anybody else.

wait, wait, hold it.

47:42.767 --> 47:45.433
First you encourage me
to do this shit, right?

47:45.500 --> 47:46.567
Now you want me to stop?

47:46.633 --> 47:48.233
- Follow me.

47:54.600 --> 47:55.900
- Where we going, man?

47:55.967 --> 47:57.600
Oh, you ain't sticking me
in Gen Pop and shit--

47:57.667 --> 47:59.367

We're almost there.

47:59.433 --> 48:01.233

Man, shit.

48:01.300 --> 48:04.133
Hey, yo, McManus, I ain't
with this shit at all, alright?

48:06.667 --> 48:09.667
Oh, no, man, you ain't gonna
make me mop and shit again.

48:09.734 --> 48:13.834
- Omar, Omar, if you would
just shut up a fucking second,

48:13.900 --> 48:16.233
I think that
you'll be pleased.

48:22.266 --> 48:24.734
- Holy shit.

48:24.800 --> 48:27.266
Damn, boy.

48:27.333 --> 48:32.233
- You'll practice in here
for an hour each day.

48:32.300 --> 48:37.000

McManus.

48:37.066 --> 48:39.934
You a straight up
motherfuckin' humdinger, boy.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.400
- Yeah, yeah,
that's me, humdinger.

48:50.500 --> 48:53.533
- I heard you got your own
little private practice shack.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.667
You ready to do
a little slinging for me?

48:56.734 --> 48:58.266
- Slinging?
Sling what?

48:58.333 --> 48:59.567
What you mean,
like selling drugs?

48:59.633 --> 49:04.567
No, no, I can't--
I can't risk that now.

49:04.633 --> 49:07.100
- Now, see,

49:07.166 --> 49:12.100
that's not the answer I was
looking to hear from you.

49:12.166 --> 49:15.600
Now here's how
it's gonna work.

49:15.667 --> 49:17.900
I'm gonna
give you the stash,

49:17.967 --> 49:20.066
you move it on over
to my man Reggie,

49:20.133 --> 49:22.200
and he moves it
on over to Unit C.

49:23.934 --> 49:26.667
And if you got
a problem with that,

49:26.734 --> 49:29.767
then you gonna have
a bigger problem with me.

49:29.834 --> 49:32.133
So, I'm gonna
ask you one more time,

49:32.200 --> 49:35.667
are you ready to do
some slinging with me?

49:38.433 --> 49:43.133
- Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
Fine. Fine.

49:43.200 --> 49:44.600
- Take it.

Omar,

if I find out you been
using some of that shit,

49:53.100 --> 49:55.233
there ain't gonna be
nothing left of you

49:55.300 --> 49:57.333
to sweep up
off the floor.

49:57.400 --> 49:59.567
- Believe me, Redding,

49:59.633 --> 50:02.834

want to stay clean.

- If "rhetorical" means dumb
as fuck, you got that right.

50:40.834 --> 50:43.000
- You ain't too big on the small
talk, is you, brother?

50:43.066 --> 50:45.500
- Business is business.

50:45.567 --> 50:49.000
- Yeah, well,
pleasure's better.

50:51.100 --> 50:55.000
- Later, fuckin'
rhetorical nigga.

51:00.300 --> 51:01.900
- Yo, man.

51:06.734 --> 51:08.867
- Good work.

51:11.066 --> 51:14.867
Never let it be said that
I ain't a patron of the arts.

51:25.834 --> 51:28.233
- Whoo, boy.

51:28.300 --> 51:30.333
Tough day
at the office, Jack.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.667
How was yours?

51:33.734 --> 51:37.533
What--what you doing?

51:37.600 --> 51:39.433
- Omar...

51:40.667 --> 51:42.100
Please.

51:43.767 --> 51:45.500
- What?

51:45.567 --> 51:49.967
- Be quiet.

51:50.033 --> 51:52.667
- Yeah, I'm just trying
to wind down and shit,

51:52.734 --> 51:54.266
you know
what I'm saying?

51:54.333 --> 51:57.266
- Then wind down
in silence.

51:57.333 --> 51:59.900
- What the fuck?
What's eating you, huh?

51:59.967 --> 52:01.700
Something I did
or something, what?

52:01.767 --> 52:04.700
- Omar, now you may be
my biggest concern,

52:04.767 --> 52:06.467
but you are certainly not
my only one,

52:06.533 --> 52:09.066
so please,
please, please!

52:10.900 --> 52:14.300
Leave me in peace.

52:41.800 --> 52:44.800
- Good morning, Imam.

52:44.867 --> 52:48.400
Preparing for
tomorrow's lecture?

52:48.467 --> 52:50.533
- No.

52:50.600 --> 52:53.500
- Music appreciation
and theory?

52:55.467 --> 52:57.767
- That's right.

52:57.834 --> 53:00.333
- What about us, minister?

53:00.400 --> 53:03.433
I understand our faith
does not discourage against

53:03.500 --> 53:04.967
the improvement
of others,

53:05.033 --> 53:09.233
but it also mandates
that our leader lead.

53:09.300 --> 53:11.100
We're concerned
that Omar white

53:11.166 --> 53:13.700
is becoming too much
of a distraction.

53:13.767 --> 53:16.000
- "We"?

53:16.066 --> 53:18.567
Lalar, you concur?

53:18.633 --> 53:19.867
- Look--

53:19.934 --> 53:22.400
- Ahmad, do you feel
spiritually adrift,

53:22.467 --> 53:24.533
now that I've taken
somebody else under my wing?

53:24.600 --> 53:26.867
- Imam, I--
- Oh...

53:26.934 --> 53:28.567
Lookie here.

53:28.633 --> 53:29.934
Huey, Dewey, and Jigabooey

53:30.000 --> 53:32.734
are having a little lesson.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.300
- Lalar, step back!

53:37.767 --> 53:39.000
Now...

53:42.266 --> 53:45.066
Sarif...

53:45.133 --> 53:47.567
Let's go.

53:47.633 --> 53:49.867
- I hope it was
something I said.

54:00.633 --> 54:03.500
Out on the Serengeti,
where these nigs are from,

54:03.567 --> 54:06.300
you know how you send a message
to the leader of the pack?

54:06.367 --> 54:09.100
You kill the youngest
and the weakest of the herd.

54:09.166 --> 54:11.900
- I seen that
on those wildlife shows.

54:11.967 --> 54:15.767
- Well, I think it's time
we do a little big game hunting.

54:18.633 --> 54:21.000
- The Vikings
eventually got civilized,

54:21.066 --> 54:22.800
became Christians.

54:22.867 --> 54:26.500
They're now the Danes,
the Norwegians, the Swedes.

54:26.567 --> 54:28.233
What's ironic is...

54:28.300 --> 54:30.700
Despite all them war-loving
genes in their system,

54:30.767 --> 54:33.500
Norway now gives out
the Nobel Peace Prize.

54:33.567 --> 54:35.834
I guess a people
can change

54:35.900 --> 54:38.200
if they put their
collective minds to it.

54:51.333 --> 54:52.900
- Pretty cushy gig for a jig.

54:52.967 --> 54:54.600
Trusting you around
all of this merchandise.

54:54.667 --> 54:58.166
I mean, how are we to know
that you're not stealing shit?

55:00.734 --> 55:03.800
- Guess we better
open you up and check.

55:06.367 --> 55:08.333
- Nope, nothing there.

55:08.400 --> 55:10.433
- Maybe in his arm.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.300
- Maybe.

55:18.834 --> 55:21.300
Oh, strike fuckin' two.

55:21.367 --> 55:23.667
Well, Lalar,

55:23.734 --> 55:25.800
I recommend you get comfortable.

55:25.867 --> 55:27.900
This could take
a little while.

55:33.533 --> 55:35.767
- Oh!

55:38.533 --> 55:41.734
- Oh.
