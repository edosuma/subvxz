WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:13.867
"Beware the destroyers."
That's what the message said.

00:13.800 --> 00:18.545
These coordinates are where the Goa'uld
will launch their attack. It's a warning.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.856
- Or so your vision foretells.
- No! It wasn't a vision, or a dream,

00:21.800 --> 00:24.800
or a hallucination. It was... real.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.617
I know this is hard for you to believe,
but the entire time

00:28.559 --> 00:31.844
you thought I had
disappeared on P3R-233,

00:31.800 --> 00:35.051
I was experiencing an alternate reality.

00:35.240 --> 00:38.905
And you were there and you were there,
and there's no place like home.

00:38.840 --> 00:43.253
<i>- As a matter of fact, you were there!
- It's not that we don't believe you...</i>

00:43.161 --> 00:47.075
- So you do?
- No! It's just that...

00:47.000 --> 00:50.121
- We don't believe you.
- Jack, this is very important.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.737
When you were in this alternate reality,
were there differences?

00:53.680 --> 00:59.020
Yes, uh... Teal'c was leading the attack
on Earth. I wasn't part of the programme.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.121
You and Jack
were engaged to be married.

01:01.121 --> 01:03.612
- Excuse me?
- What?

01:05.480 --> 01:11.234
OK, uh, even if you did actually
experience this alternate reality,

01:11.079 --> 01:14.579
the fact that there were differences
means we won't face the same fate.

01:14.521 --> 01:19.313
Yes, but the defining event - the death
of Ra - took place in both worlds.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.186
- An attack of retribution?
- Yes!

01:23.161 --> 01:26.079
And the same thing will happen here
unless we stop it.

01:26.040 --> 01:29.623
All right,
let me get something straight here.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.757
Engaged?

01:32.760 --> 01:36.176
- It is theoretically possible.
- It's against regulations.

01:36.121 --> 01:38.159
I'm talking physics, sir.

01:38.161 --> 01:43.914
The concept of alternate realities
was predicted by Einstein a long time...

01:43.760 --> 01:47.010
I thought you might all be here.
How's our boy?

01:46.960 --> 01:49.332
He's gonna be just fine, General.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.780
Major Samuels.

01:50.801 --> 01:53.756
That's Lieutenant Colonel Samuels now,
Captain.

01:54.442 --> 01:57.526
- I beg your pardon, sir. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:57.481 --> 01:59.771
You'll always be Sparky to me.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.216
<i>Weren't you transferred to the Pentagon?</i>

02:02.201 --> 02:06.780
I was. Stargate mission analysis.
I'm here today for the hearing.

02:07.801 --> 02:09.461
Hearing?

02:10.080 --> 02:13.000
Senator Kinsey?
The Stargate programme?

02:13.760 --> 02:17.094
- I thought you were gonna testify.
- They will.

02:17.042 --> 02:22.167
SG-1 just returned from a mission.
I haven't had the chance to inform them.

02:22.042 --> 02:25.162
Well, perhaps I shouldn't
say too much more.

02:25.121 --> 02:27.576
Oh, cut the crap. What's goin' on?

02:29.401 --> 02:33.352
Senator Kinsey has taken
a great deal of interest in the programme.

02:33.281 --> 02:36.981
Thus far, he hasn't liked what he's seen.

02:36.921 --> 02:38.997
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:39.002 --> 02:43.295
As you should be, Colonel.
It could mean the end of the Stargate.

02:44.122 --> 02:49.543
The hearing is at 1400 hours.
I look forward to seeing you all there.

03:58.484 --> 04:02.102
Yes, sir, I understand.
We'll fight the good fight.

04:05.044 --> 04:10.998
General, politics isn't my strong suit,
but doesn't president outrank senator?

04:10.844 --> 04:14.378
Senator Kinsey is chairman
of the appropriations committee.

04:14.323 --> 04:20.326
He wants to know what's behind the line
item the Pentagon refers to as area 52.

04:20.165 --> 04:22.536
That would be the Stargate.

04:22.524 --> 04:24.682
An unofficial project

04:25.283 --> 04:29.531
that just happens to cost
$7.4 billion a year to operate.

04:29.444 --> 04:34.687
The president thought if he granted
the senator the appropriate clearances,

04:34.564 --> 04:37.233
let him in on the existence of the SGC,

04:37.202 --> 04:40.951
he'd recognise its importance to
security and authorise the expenditure.

04:41.483 --> 04:44.567
- I take it he didn't.
- The idea backfired.

04:45.404 --> 04:48.939
After reading your mission reports
and being briefed by Samuels,

04:48.884 --> 04:53.346
the senator decided the SGC will receive
no further funding from the Treasury.

04:53.245 --> 04:55.735
That effectively shuts us down, sir.

04:55.725 --> 05:01.430
Very effectively. Costs a billion dollars
just to turn the lights on around here.

05:02.165 --> 05:04.406
How about a bake sale?

05:05.564 --> 05:08.233
Yard sale? Garage...

05:08.204 --> 05:12.072
This is what I look like
when I'm not laughing, Colonel.

05:13.084 --> 05:15.161
<i>Car wash?</i>

05:15.725 --> 05:21.230
I'm sorry, sir. It's just, I don't get it.
How does one man get that much power?

05:21.084 --> 05:23.457
The constitution of these United States.

05:24.644 --> 05:27.848
The issue of our worth
could be debated in the Senate,

05:27.805 --> 05:30.805
but not without making
the Stargate known to the public.

05:31.925 --> 05:36.338
The president doesn't believe
the time for that has come. I agree.

05:46.564 --> 05:48.641
Well, he's late.

05:50.004 --> 05:53.338
You seem more apprehensive
of this hearing than of battle.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.408
I prefer battle, actually.

05:55.404 --> 05:58.110
Once we tell him
Earth's future is at stake...

05:58.084 --> 05:59.745
Daniel.

06:03.125 --> 06:08.202
Let's keep the alternate-reality story
as our ace in the hole, shall we?

06:09.406 --> 06:10.685
<i>Why?</i>

06:14.685 --> 06:18.552
- Just because.
- Ladies and gentlemen, I apologise.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.370
A certain congressman,
who will go nameless,

06:21.365 --> 06:26.028
just does not know how
to take no for an answer.

06:25.925 --> 06:30.053
Ah, so this is the infamous SG-1.

06:29.966 --> 06:32.254
Infamous! Yes, sir.

06:33.764 --> 06:38.095
- Colonel Jack O'Neill.
- Ah, Colonel. I've heard a lot about you.

06:38.004 --> 06:41.456
Don't believe a word of it, Senator.
I'm actually a nice guy.

06:45.446 --> 06:49.396
And this must be the drain
through which the money flows.

06:50.245 --> 06:53.531
I know you have
a very busy schedule, Senator.

06:53.487 --> 06:57.105
Yes, of course, General Hammond.
Please be seated.

07:05.206 --> 07:07.413
Let me see. Colonel O'Neill...

07:09.446 --> 07:11.687
Captain Carter,

07:12.166 --> 07:13.959
Dr. Jackson,

07:14.846 --> 07:18.096
Teal'c - with an apostrophe, I understand.

07:18.848 --> 07:23.391
Let me first say that though illness
stopped me from serving in the military,

07:23.286 --> 07:25.742
I have great respect for those who do.

07:25.728 --> 07:30.435
Especially those who have made
service of country their life's work,

07:30.326 --> 07:33.362
as I have in my own way.

07:34.526 --> 07:39.735
- There is no more honourable vocation.
- Thank you. I couldn't agree more.

07:39.606 --> 07:42.560
Having said that,
I want to make one thing clear:

07:42.526 --> 07:46.310
I am by nature suspicious
of all things secretive,

07:46.528 --> 07:50.276
be they in the government
or inside the military service.

07:50.207 --> 07:54.917
I believe that which grows in shadow
but withers in the light of day

07:54.807 --> 07:56.966
does not belong on the vine.

07:58.367 --> 08:02.411
I've read several reports
of your excursion.

08:02.327 --> 08:06.408
Colonel Samuels has been kind enough
to brief me on the Stargate,

08:06.326 --> 08:09.447
and I have tried to maintain an open mind.

08:09.408 --> 08:13.951
I must admit that I find
the very idea of this facility,

08:13.848 --> 08:17.632
of this command, offensive.

08:17.728 --> 08:20.932
It is far too dangerous
to be this secretive.

08:20.887 --> 08:25.548
I found several examples where you
have averted tragedy on a global scale

08:25.447 --> 08:30.324
by the skin of your teeth, and virtually
none where you found anything of worth.

08:36.327 --> 08:42.200
However, since I have,
on occasion, been wrong before,

08:44.888 --> 08:49.466
the president of the United States
has asked me to hear you out.

08:51.849 --> 08:54.054
So here I am.

08:54.048 --> 08:58.710
Well... as long as
you've got an open mind.

09:00.208 --> 09:01.203
Colonel...

09:01.648 --> 09:05.063
For cryin' out loud, Samuels,
what'd you tell this man?

09:05.009 --> 09:06.384
The truth.

09:06.408 --> 09:08.982
Colonel Samuels was
entirely nonpartisan.

09:08.969 --> 09:13.547
<i>OK. Now, that's impossible. He's been
against this programme from day one.</i>

09:13.448 --> 09:17.909
If anything, I voiced my awe
and amazement at what the Stargate is.

09:18.489 --> 09:23.399
- A technological marvel.
- It is so much more than that, Senator.

09:23.288 --> 09:28.081
The Stargate represents a giant step
in our understanding of the universe.

09:27.969 --> 09:33.389
We have learned more about astrophysics
in a few months than in the last 50 years!

09:33.250 --> 09:37.827
It also gives us insights into cultures
that are thousands of years old.

09:37.730 --> 09:41.181
Dr. Jackson, I'm sure as a scholar
of ancient mythology,

09:41.129 --> 09:44.581
you are familiar with the story of Pandora.

09:44.528 --> 09:47.482
From Greek mythology, of course.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.540
The first woman created by Zeus,
who gave her a box

09:51.490 --> 09:55.653
- And warned her never to open it.
- But she did, out of curiosity.

09:55.570 --> 10:00.066
Despite the warning of her God,
who was also her father, she did.

10:00.849 --> 10:05.677
And from it sprung all the plagues and evil
that exist now in this world.

10:05.570 --> 10:11.442
And, keeping in mind that this is a myth,
she closed it in time to keep hope inside.

10:11.289 --> 10:16.876
Then should we not close your gate for
the same reason - to keep hope inside?

10:16.730 --> 10:19.399
Senator, if I may jump in here...

10:20.649 --> 10:25.192
I'm not as slick as you guys
talking in metaphors here.

10:25.289 --> 10:27.496
I'm a military man.

10:27.490 --> 10:29.861
I prefer facts.

10:29.850 --> 10:35.604
And the fact is the gate,
ie "the box", is already open.

10:36.570 --> 10:41.730
Now, what's done is done. We made
ourselves an enemy by killing Ra,

10:41.610 --> 10:44.480
- But the threat the Goa'ulds represent...
- Threat?

10:44.450 --> 10:47.236
Yes, sir. As in "threatening".

10:47.850 --> 10:53.272
The word "threat", Colonel O'Neill, is
used too often by this country's military

10:53.129 --> 10:56.664
as a justification for expenditures
we can no longer afford.

10:56.610 --> 10:59.480
Do you know
how much this programme costs?

11:03.370 --> 11:04.698
Seven... ish.

11:04.730 --> 11:08.811
Seven billion,
four hundred and seven million dollars!

11:08.730 --> 11:11.268
- Give or take.
- Per year!

11:11.409 --> 11:16.238
With all due respect, the accounting
department is up on level 3, I believe.

11:16.571 --> 11:19.357
But if you want to talk about
maintaining the defence

11:19.331 --> 11:24.123
<i>against what I believe is
the greatest enemy humanity has faced...</i>

11:24.010 --> 11:26.846
- Hyperbole!
- See for yourself!

11:26.811 --> 11:31.851
General, I suggest we dial up
old P4A-771, I believe it was.

11:31.731 --> 11:35.100
See how long the good senator
lasts in that world!

11:35.052 --> 11:38.634
I have spent a career
listening to doomsayers in uniform.

11:38.811 --> 11:44.268
Let us build our billion-dollar machine to
save America from barbarians at the gate!

11:44.130 --> 11:47.547
Let me remind you
that the Cold War is over!

11:47.491 --> 11:53.162
Let me tell you something! This time there
are barbarians - they're called Goa'ulds.

11:53.011 --> 11:55.846
And they really are at the gate. That one!

11:55.811 --> 11:58.182
Then I suggest we close it.

11:58.171 --> 12:02.797
Senator, we believe the Goa'uld are about
to launch an attack, in force, in ships.

12:05.171 --> 12:09.418
Then I think they'll regret taking on
the United States military.

12:09.331 --> 12:11.039
Oh, for God's sake.

12:11.052 --> 12:15.346
Oh, you're right. We'll just upload
a computer virus into the mother ship.

12:15.250 --> 12:18.336
If they come in ships,
we won't be any match for them.

12:18.291 --> 12:21.494
At their level of technology,
they can wipe us out from orbit.

12:21.451 --> 12:24.619
- I'm not convinced of that.
- They speak the truth.

12:24.571 --> 12:26.778
I'm not entirely convinced of that either.

12:26.770 --> 12:29.725
General, why are we here?!
He's made up his mind.

12:29.692 --> 12:33.772
Sit down, Colonel. When I've made up
my mind, you will know it.

12:36.412 --> 12:38.653
I will ask you once more.

12:39.373 --> 12:42.871
Sit down, please.

12:45.653 --> 12:47.312
Colonel.

12:54.371 --> 12:59.711
I gave the president my word I would give
you a fair hearing and I intend to do that.

12:59.572 --> 13:03.488
He held you and your team up
as a shining example

13:03.412 --> 13:06.532
of the fine work the SGC is doing.

13:08.092 --> 13:12.304
Now... do you stand by SG-1's record?

13:12.812 --> 13:14.889
Yes, I do.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.668
Then let's just go through it, shall we?

13:26.373 --> 13:28.448
Thank you.

13:31.972 --> 13:37.808
On February 10 of this year, you and
a team led by Major Charles Kawalsky

13:37.653 --> 13:40.061
went on a reconnaissance mission...

13:40.052 --> 13:43.088
<i>Excuse me, Senator.</i>

13:43.933 --> 13:46.803
Samuels, could I get a copy of that?

13:46.773 --> 13:49.144
You wrote this report, Colonel.

13:49.533 --> 13:52.653
Just want a little reference.

13:52.613 --> 13:54.071
Samuels.

13:56.253 --> 14:02.291
To repeat: on 10 February you and
a team led by Major Charles Kawalsky

14:02.134 --> 14:04.340
went through on a
reconnaissance mission

14:04.333 --> 14:08.118
to rescue both Dr. Jackson's wife
and her brother,

14:08.052 --> 14:13.344
- And to determine the Goauld threat.
- Excuse me, Senator, I'm sorry.

14:13.214 --> 14:18.422
<i>There should be an apostrophe after
the a, before the u. It's pronounced...</i>

14:18.573 --> 14:20.152
Goa'uld.

14:20.174 --> 14:23.673
I assume, since you were
captured and imprisoned,

14:23.613 --> 14:27.693
that you would characterise this world
as an enemy stronghold.

14:28.614 --> 14:30.903
I would.

14:32.293 --> 14:38.167
I read from the personal report of
Colonel Jack O'Neill, dated 23 February.

14:38.014 --> 14:41.963
"Skaara was chosen. I tried to stop them
from taking him away,

14:41.894 --> 14:45.014
but was struck by an alien staff weapon."

14:44.975 --> 14:48.307
"In that moment, Apophis gave the order."

14:48.614 --> 14:51.650
<i>Kill the rest.</i>

15:27.815 --> 15:30.306
I can save these people!

15:32.095 --> 15:34.254
Help me!

15:36.575 --> 15:38.817
Help me.

15:38.815 --> 15:40.807
Many have said that.

15:43.774 --> 15:44.557
Orgh!

15:44.615 --> 15:46.940
But you are the first I believe could do it!

16:07.655 --> 16:09.813
Get outta the way!

16:21.975 --> 16:25.427
<i>- Come on, let's move!
- Come on! Come on!</i>

16:25.376 --> 16:27.701
<i>- Come on!
- Move! Come on!</i>

16:27.697 --> 16:29.735
Come on. Go! There you go! Go!

16:29.736 --> 16:32.309
Go, go! Come on!

16:49.975 --> 16:54.056
So, even with your team unarmed,
at the enemy's mercy,

16:53.975 --> 16:57.640
in the palm of their hand, as it were,

16:57.576 --> 17:01.076
one of their own was able to set you free.

17:01.017 --> 17:02.974
It... it wasn't that simple, Senator.

17:04.214 --> 17:05.759
Read on, please.

17:05.777 --> 17:09.478
"We met heavy resistance
on our return to the Stargate,

17:09.415 --> 17:13.579
and became pinned down
by enemy aircraft."

17:20.217 --> 17:22.624
Take cover!

17:59.577 --> 18:02.151
Colonel, we're sitting ducks here!

18:18.617 --> 18:21.785
It seems to me that
Major Kawalsky made light work

18:21.738 --> 18:25.569
of what you referred to
in your report as a "death glider".

18:25.498 --> 18:28.451
They were taken by surprise.

18:28.417 --> 18:31.170
I wouldn't expect it
to be as easy next time.

18:31.138 --> 18:34.637
- Why not?
- They weren't used to fighting humans

18:34.577 --> 18:37.614
with our level of technology.
Now they are.

18:37.578 --> 18:40.948
You don't understand how much
more powerful their weapons are.

18:41.337 --> 18:44.089
Yet you managed to get away
with minimal casualties.

18:44.057 --> 18:47.011
Hardly the greatest threat
humanity has ever faced.

18:55.219 --> 18:57.376
What's happening?

18:57.378 --> 19:00.499
It's just SG-2 returning
on schedule, Senator.

19:00.459 --> 19:03.163
There's nothing to worry about.

19:05.699 --> 19:07.775
Oh, I disagree, General.

19:09.659 --> 19:12.660
I think it is something to worry about.

19:19.898 --> 19:24.856
Mr. Kinsey is under the impression
the Goa'uld aren't a military threat.

19:25.138 --> 19:29.267
You seem to have defeated them
handily at every turn.

19:29.179 --> 19:31.848
Did you read all the reports, sir?

19:32.778 --> 19:35.151
They actually killed us once.

19:39.019 --> 19:41.095
<i>Sha'ti.</i>

20:18.380 --> 20:19.625
Kree-ga!

20:31.540 --> 20:33.035
Colonel!

20:33.940 --> 20:35.221
Urgh!

20:37.819 --> 20:39.611
Argh!

20:41.180 --> 20:42.971
Argh!

20:46.980 --> 20:51.309
If Goa'uld technology can generate
energy shields around individuals,

20:51.220 --> 20:53.627
they can do the same with whole armies.

20:53.621 --> 20:55.448
And ships.

20:55.861 --> 20:58.778
And have you ever seen
one of these ships?

20:59.101 --> 21:00.262
Yes, sir.

21:27.662 --> 21:31.444
It is the ship of the Goa'uld Nirrti -
an enemy of Apophis.

21:33.740 --> 21:37.608
- Now, what the hell is that?
- We must go.

21:47.861 --> 21:50.566
We must get to the Stargate.

21:50.541 --> 21:52.367
No argument from me!

21:52.622 --> 21:56.951
Goa'uld Nirrti once sent an emissary
of peace to negotiate a treaty

21:56.862 --> 21:59.980
concerning a Stargate
Apophis had taken control of.

21:59.941 --> 22:04.153
The negotiation was a ploy.
The Stargate was destroyed.

22:18.141 --> 22:20.467
Take your time. No hurry.

22:33.541 --> 22:36.911
<i>You escaped, Colonel.
On foot, I might add.</i>

22:37.221 --> 22:41.220
Just one of these Goa'uld ships
was responsible for the deaths of SG-7

22:41.143 --> 22:45.471
and the entire local population.
And that's over 1,000 people.

22:45.382 --> 22:51.300
The point is, sir, we have seen how
the Goa'uld destroy entire civilisations.

22:55.781 --> 22:57.109
Hello?

23:01.702 --> 23:03.694
Hello.

23:08.063 --> 23:11.267
- What are you?
- Energy, unity.

23:11.221 --> 23:14.721
- You would describe me thus.
- You asked for help.

23:15.022 --> 23:19.601
If I remain here,
my energy will disintegrate. I must return.

23:19.782 --> 23:22.784
- Why did you not speak before?
- Fear.

23:23.021 --> 23:27.434
- Fear of what?
- The Goa'uld came to our planet once.

23:27.343 --> 23:30.593
We were not afraid then
and we tried to greet them.

23:30.544 --> 23:35.039
One of them touched us as you did
and was destroyed by our energy.

23:58.702 --> 24:03.329
- The Goa'ulds came through the gate.
- It was afraid because we look like them.

24:03.222 --> 24:07.386
- One of the Goa'ulds was killed?
- They gathered all the unity in one place

24:07.303 --> 24:10.719
- And ended it.
- Goa'uld energy weapons did it.

24:10.824 --> 24:15.983
Then that pit wasn't a ceremonial place.
It was some kind of... mass grave.

24:20.983 --> 24:25.361
- I'd call that a threat.
- Admittedly, the Goa'uld are dangerous.

24:26.345 --> 24:30.093
More dangerous
than you could possibly know.

24:30.023 --> 24:34.104
If they're so strong, why did you
switch sides in the first place?

24:34.025 --> 24:37.643
Because what is right
cannot be measured by strength.

24:37.585 --> 24:41.997
Your world values freedom.
I wish freedom for my people.

24:41.903 --> 24:45.818
I don't want to appear callous, sir,
but I believe that's your problem,

24:45.743 --> 24:47.819
not ours.

24:50.423 --> 24:53.959
It will soon be yours as well,
Senator Kinsey,

24:53.904 --> 24:57.737
for the Goa'uld are as powerful
as they are evil.

24:57.664 --> 25:02.660
- They have enslaved a galaxy of worlds...
- I don't care about other worlds.

25:02.545 --> 25:05.877
<i>I must place the citizens
of this country first.</i>

25:05.825 --> 25:09.028
Then you would be wise
to heed our warning,

25:08.984 --> 25:12.852
for when the Goa'uld finally
do come in force... and they will...

25:12.785 --> 25:17.991
your citizens, as the strongest country
of this world, will be the first to die.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.822
On your return from the Chulak mission,

25:38.785 --> 25:42.319
Major Kawalsky became infested
with a Goa'uld parasite. Correct?

25:42.665 --> 25:46.615
- That's correct.
- He very nearly destroyed this facility.

26:05.346 --> 26:10.090
<i>- Jaffa... kal sha!
- You cannot pass.</i>

26:11.986 --> 26:14.144
- What?
- He set the coordinates for Chulak.

26:22.625 --> 26:26.243
- He set the autodestruct sequence.
- How'd he have the code?

26:26.185 --> 26:29.602
I don't know, but I need two officers
to override, and you're it.

26:45.947 --> 26:47.986
That did it. Open the blast doors!

26:53.546 --> 26:55.005
Teal'c!

26:55.027 --> 26:57.148
Hold him there!

26:59.186 --> 27:01.262
Shut it down!

27:02.227 --> 27:03.471
Now!

27:08.586 --> 27:10.792
- We stopped him.
- Yes, you did.

27:10.945 --> 27:14.861
On that occasion,
with the loss of a fine officer, you did.

27:14.787 --> 27:19.579
But consider the myriad plagues you
could bring back through the Stargate.

27:19.467 --> 27:22.301
Reason enough to shut it down for ever.

27:22.707 --> 27:24.782
Colonel Samuels.

27:26.186 --> 27:31.644
I quote from the official report of General
Hammond, dated March of this year,

27:31.507 --> 27:35.421
concerning a dangerous disease brought
back by SG-1 from another world.

27:36.267 --> 27:38.971
I'm afraid I have a serious situation here.

27:38.947 --> 27:44.534
It appears we've brought a very
contagious disease through the Stargate.

27:44.387 --> 27:46.463
Yes, sir. That's right.

27:47.827 --> 27:51.741
I ordered the mountain sealed off, but
you should order in an armoured division

27:51.667 --> 27:54.372
to set up a second line of defence.

27:56.948 --> 28:00.233
My recommendation is anyone
attempting to leave the mountain

28:00.186 --> 28:04.351
should be shot on sight...
and their body burned.

28:11.866 --> 28:17.240
Sorry, Colonel O'Neill, but your
private room just became semiprivate.

28:17.107 --> 28:23.395
We're running out of places to put victims.
We've used the brigs, the storage rooms...

28:25.028 --> 28:29.275
<i>- Good luck, Doc...
- Did you say something?</i>

28:30.667 --> 28:33.039
Give... more...

28:33.028 --> 28:35.354
What? Give more what?

28:36.508 --> 28:38.167
More...

28:41.548 --> 28:44.834
An injection?
You mean you want more sedative?

28:45.708 --> 28:50.204
You've had twice as much as anyone else
because you've been more violent.

28:50.107 --> 28:51.816
- Give.
- No.

28:51.989 --> 28:54.395
- It's not safe.
- Give!

28:56.827 --> 28:58.572
Give.

28:58.588 --> 29:00.876
Why are you so insistent?

29:32.028 --> 29:34.698
Must have been in a lot of pain.

29:39.190 --> 29:41.266
<i>Doc!</i>

29:42.788 --> 29:44.865
Colonel O'Neill?

29:45.910 --> 29:47.568
It's...

29:50.710 --> 29:52.368
me.

29:55.108 --> 29:58.229
So you are still in there somewhere.

29:59.788 --> 30:02.826
Dream... A dream...

30:04.189 --> 30:07.190
I'm afraid not, Colonel. It's very real.

30:08.790 --> 30:13.038
This is interesting. Enough sedative
must knock back the primitive mind.

30:12.949 --> 30:17.278
Colonel, listen. I can't keep you
at this level very long. It is too dangerous.

30:17.189 --> 30:20.025
It could cause permanent brain damage.

30:19.990 --> 30:22.066
What? Wh...

30:24.230 --> 30:27.230
- What is it?
- It's a parasitic virus.

30:27.191 --> 30:30.855
All we can tell is
that it messes with body chemicals.

30:30.789 --> 30:34.076
Testosterone levels skyrocket,
thus the aggressive behaviour.

30:34.030 --> 30:37.316
It's a histaminolytic -
it breaks down histamine. Wh...

30:37.269 --> 30:41.433
Experiment on me.

30:41.349 --> 30:43.887
Experiment on you?

30:43.869 --> 30:46.194
No, sir, I can't do that.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.427
Use me.

30:55.670 --> 30:59.369
We saved an entire race of people.
I'd call that a success, sir.

30:59.951 --> 31:02.904
But if you hadn't found a cure so readily,

31:02.871 --> 31:07.498
if it had reached the population,
if the effects weren't reversible...

31:10.151 --> 31:12.227
Colonel O'Neill...

31:12.230 --> 31:17.058
you very nearly died on yet another
occasion when infected by, uh...

31:17.510 --> 31:19.549
Nanocytes, sir.

31:22.431 --> 31:24.837
Jack, Carter's coming back!

31:28.711 --> 31:30.371
Jack.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.351
Welcome back, Captain.

31:55.311 --> 31:57.849
So, what did you find out?

31:58.551 --> 32:01.423
Come on, don't keep the elderly waiting.
It's rude.

32:01.672 --> 32:03.332
Um...

32:06.071 --> 32:09.737
- It isn't a virus.
- All right, what is it?

32:09.672 --> 32:13.586
Well, Dr. Fraiser and I came up empty.
She's still working on it,

32:13.510 --> 32:17.509
- But it's gonna take time.
- Time is what these people don't have.

32:19.232 --> 32:22.435
- Nor do I.
- Colonel, there's something else.

32:22.392 --> 32:26.140
Your blood sample showed way
more organisms than the Argosians.

32:26.672 --> 32:30.040
- How many more?
- On the level of 100 times more.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.865
And they are multiplying.

32:31.871 --> 32:33.947
Cut to it, Captain.

32:35.991 --> 32:37.902
At the rate you're changing,

32:38.511 --> 32:42.888
by the end of two weeks
you'll be the equivalent of 100 years old.

32:43.873 --> 32:48.166
We've given the nanocytes live tissue
to interact with, but they won't touch it.

32:48.073 --> 32:50.778
All they do is make more of themselves.

32:51.032 --> 32:53.784
So, how are they causing
the ageing on Argos?

32:53.752 --> 32:57.666
Maybe there's something on Argos
they need to make them do a task.

32:57.593 --> 33:00.048
Something in the air or the food.

33:05.992 --> 33:08.233
<i>Whoa!</i>

33:09.192 --> 33:11.599
<i>- Is there a problem, Captain?
- I don't know.</i>

33:11.593 --> 33:14.165
It's eating through the rubber.

33:15.913 --> 33:17.157
Oh, God.

33:17.712 --> 33:21.876
- What? What is it?
- They're trying to spread.

33:26.792 --> 33:30.790
<i>We're working with
computer and practical simulations.</i>

33:30.712 --> 33:35.339
<i>Realistically, sir,
I'm afraid it might take years.</i>

33:35.232 --> 33:39.527
<i>The general says gate travel
to Argos is off limits for the next few,</i>

33:39.433 --> 33:41.472
<i>uh, millennia.</i>

33:41.473 --> 33:46.681
<i>But we can send objects through,
so if you need anything, just call.</i>

33:49.552 --> 33:51.628
<i>Say something.</i>

33:52.313 --> 33:57.307
<i>Colonel, I've learned
very much from you. Thank you.</i>

33:58.673 --> 34:01.247
<i>You know, goodbyes really suck.</i>

34:11.074 --> 34:16.413
As I understand it, you almost
lost containment, Captain Carter.

34:16.273 --> 34:19.192
Yes. They tried to mutate in the lab,

34:19.152 --> 34:23.318
but after that the general ordered
all samples of the nanocyte destroyed.

34:23.233 --> 34:26.235
- And next time?
- There won't be a next time.

34:26.193 --> 34:28.150
The nanocytes, the transmitters,

34:28.152 --> 34:31.402
everything that tampered with
that world has been destroyed.

34:31.353 --> 34:35.398
In fact, SG-2 just made contact with
Kynthia's planet a few weeks ago.

34:35.313 --> 34:41.068
They're living productive lives because
of us! I am proud of what we did there.

34:40.914 --> 34:43.322
I might even retire there.

34:44.315 --> 34:48.099
You have no fear of it, do you?
It's like a game to you.

34:48.034 --> 34:53.657
No, sir. Anything as powerful as
the Stargate deserves respect.

34:54.353 --> 34:58.601
We know how dangerous it is to do
what we do, but also how important it is.

34:58.514 --> 35:03.472
Colonel O'Neill, you're like reckless
children and you're playing with fire.

35:03.355 --> 35:06.474
If you shut down this programme now,
when it's needed...

35:06.434 --> 35:09.969
- For what?
- To gather technology, weapons.

35:09.914 --> 35:13.864
Not at this price
or this level of competence.

35:13.795 --> 35:16.748
My people are the best out there, Senator.

35:16.715 --> 35:21.293
I'm sorry, General,
but your best is not good enough.

35:21.914 --> 35:25.081
I do not approve of
nor support this endeavour.

35:25.036 --> 35:28.570
And I have heard nothing here
today that would change my mind.

35:30.275 --> 35:33.230
I intend to shut the Stargate down.

35:43.914 --> 35:46.998
- Senator, please listen to me.
- He's made up his mind.

35:46.956 --> 35:48.994
You want your one reason? I'll give it.

35:48.994 --> 35:51.568
What if I knew that they
were coming, in ships?

35:51.556 --> 35:56.976
That a ship larger than the pyramids will
land on this mountain in weeks, days?

35:56.835 --> 36:00.880
Then I would be curious to know
why you've waited until now to say so.

36:02.076 --> 36:04.567
Because I didn't think
anyone would believe me.

36:04.556 --> 36:07.177
<i>If I didn't live through it,
I wouldn't, but it's a fact.</i>

36:07.157 --> 36:12.032
If you shut this programme down,
we can't stop them before they get here.

36:11.916 --> 36:16.079
- Where did you learn this... information?
- On our last mission.

36:15.996 --> 36:20.574
We found a civilisation with technology
similar to ours. They had been wiped out.

36:20.476 --> 36:23.809
They left behind a warning.
"Beware the destroyers."

36:23.755 --> 36:27.338
Now, along with that warning
came a set of numbers.

36:27.277 --> 36:31.190
Coordinates that indicate where
the Goa'uld attack will be launched from.

36:31.115 --> 36:35.992
- And did all of you witness this warning?
- No, sir, they didn't. Just me.

36:37.317 --> 36:39.273
Sir...

36:40.637 --> 36:43.840
we think Daniel may have experienced

36:43.795 --> 36:47.331
an interdimensional transfer
to an alternate reality.

36:48.516 --> 36:52.679
- I beg your pardon?
- When I touched an alien artefact on 233,

36:52.596 --> 36:57.009
when I was separated from the team,
I was transported to an alternate reality

36:56.916 --> 37:00.784
where Earth was already under Goa'uld
attack. I got this when I was there.

37:02.277 --> 37:05.231
My heaven, I've heard enough of this!

37:05.197 --> 37:09.775
The Goa'uld were bombarding our cities
from space. We were defenceless.

37:09.677 --> 37:12.679
Dr. Jackson, I do not suffer fools gladly!

37:12.637 --> 37:15.887
Nor do I. And I'm telling you
when we killed Ra two years ago,

37:15.836 --> 37:21.293
we started a chain of events that will lead
to an attack on Earth by the Goa'ulds!

37:21.157 --> 37:23.197
If this is so, why have they waited?

37:23.197 --> 37:26.032
It would take time for Apophis
to assemble the forces.

37:25.998 --> 37:30.458
Right. Their society is feudal.
It would take time to build an army.

37:30.356 --> 37:34.650
Look, all I know is the location that
they will launch the final attack from.

37:34.556 --> 37:38.684
If you don't believe me, let us dial in
the coordinates, go there and find out!

37:38.597 --> 37:42.429
How many ships, Dr. Jackson?
Has anyone detected their approach?

37:42.356 --> 37:46.936
I can't be sure of the details. There were
differences between that reality and this.

37:46.838 --> 37:49.293
- Of course there were.
- I am not crazy.

37:49.277 --> 37:51.186
Nor am I, Dr. Jackson.

37:51.197 --> 37:56.820
Neither am I unused to 11th-hour pleas,
but never have I heard one so desperate.

37:56.677 --> 38:00.675
- Senator, they are coming.
- Then I say let them come!

38:00.597 --> 38:06.054
Where do you get this bureaucratic bull?
You're talking suicide.

38:06.677 --> 38:10.545
Colonel O'Neill,
you underestimate this great nation.

38:10.478 --> 38:14.523
It is you who underestimates the enemy.
We have challenged Apophis.

38:14.438 --> 38:17.688
He will not rest until the people
of Earth worship him as God.

38:17.637 --> 38:21.172
There is only one God, sir!

38:21.117 --> 38:26.195
I do not believe that he would allow what
you're trying to tell me to come to pass!

38:26.079 --> 38:30.289
We are, after all, one nation under God.

38:30.197 --> 38:33.068
And... you think...

38:33.039 --> 38:35.530
God... is gonna save us?

38:36.637 --> 38:40.800
The Goa'uld believe they are gods,
and your beliefs will not dissuade them.

38:40.717 --> 38:43.635
If the Goa'uld do come,
then we will be able to tell them

38:43.597 --> 38:48.224
we have buried our gate for ever
and will never step through it again.

38:48.117 --> 38:51.782
- If they challenge us, we shall prevail.
- You're a fool.

38:51.719 --> 38:55.762
And if they do not come,
which I think is infinitely more likely,

38:55.679 --> 39:02.297
then at least Pandora's box will have
finally been closed once and for all.

39:02.559 --> 39:07.184
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have business to attend to.

39:14.239 --> 39:17.653
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry it had to end like this.

39:18.998 --> 39:21.204
Get out of here!

39:27.639 --> 39:30.923
General Hammond,
I would like to request permission

39:30.878 --> 39:35.043
to return through the Stargate
before it's permanently sealed.

39:36.998 --> 39:41.992
If this world does not intend to continue
its struggle against the Goa'uld,

39:43.199 --> 39:45.525
then here I do not belong.

39:47.199 --> 39:49.951
I think I'm goin' with him.

39:49.918 --> 39:53.869
I can't allow that, Colonel.
I'm sorry, but you know that.

39:53.800 --> 39:59.387
The president has made it clear, if we
were unable to convince the senator,

39:59.239 --> 40:01.777
we would cease operations immediately.

40:01.759 --> 40:04.297
Sir, there are still two SG teams off world.

40:04.280 --> 40:09.523
We'll keep the light on until they return,
but that's all I'm authorised to do.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.440
So... what?

40:11.440 --> 40:13.516
That's it?

40:14.519 --> 40:16.844
- That's it, Colonel.
- It can't be.

40:16.840 --> 40:20.208
- With all due respect...
- The good senator is an ass...

40:20.161 --> 40:23.860
He's an elected official
of the government we are sworn to serve.

40:23.800 --> 40:27.300
And whether we agree or disagree,
he's made his decision.

40:27.239 --> 40:32.235
Our commander in chief
has given us our orders accordingly.

40:32.121 --> 40:34.789
I expect you all to carry them out.

40:41.199 --> 40:43.074
Dismissed.
