01:19.583 --> 01:21.708
- We didn't find the Quagmires.
- Not yet.

01:21.791 --> 01:22.750
They could be anywhere.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.166
Anywhere but 667 Dark Avenue,
so we learned something.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.333
Not enough.

01:26.416 --> 01:29.791
Those poor children,
they must be so scared right now,

01:30.000 --> 01:31.083
and all alone.

01:34.666 --> 01:35.875
You found us.

01:35.958 --> 01:38.375
This story is not about a happy reunion.

01:38.458 --> 01:39.958
I'm so happy to see you.

01:40.041 --> 01:41.916
I've never been so happy to see anyone.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.541
I've read hundreds of newspaper articles,
diaries,

01:44.625 --> 01:46.791
and more than one
lavishly illustrated catalog

01:46.875 --> 01:50.041
in an attempt to understand the sad story
of the Baudelaire orphans.

01:50.125 --> 01:53.625
The horrors I have found
are best expressed not with words

01:53.708 --> 01:56.041
but with a sound you'll hear
later in this episode.

01:58.166 --> 02:00.208
It's the sound
of a long scream in the dark.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.458
As the Baudelaires rejoiced
at finding their friends...

02:02.541 --> 02:04.333
- How did you find us?
- It was Klaus' idea.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.583
It was Violet's invention.

02:05.666 --> 02:06.916
They had no inkling of the terror...

02:08.458 --> 02:09.666
The horror...

02:10.750 --> 02:12.500
and the dramatic fall
they would experience

02:12.583 --> 02:13.500
in this elevator shaft

02:13.583 --> 02:16.000
before this episode
in their lives was over.

02:16.083 --> 02:20.083
If you continue to watch,
you may find yourself screaming as well.

02:20.166 --> 02:21.625
Can you pick this lock?

02:21.708 --> 02:25.166
Not without any tools.
I wish I could see what's down here.

02:25.250 --> 02:26.375
Try this.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.500
See the markings? If you line them up...

02:32.083 --> 02:34.083
And give it
a half-turn counterclockwise.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.625
We learned that in The Incomplete
History of Secret Organizations.

02:37.708 --> 02:38.583
You found it?

02:38.666 --> 02:41.958
Right before we were kidnapped.
We took as many notes as we could.

02:42.041 --> 02:45.208
We may be kidnap victims,
but I'm still a journalist.

02:45.291 --> 02:49.291
- We've learned many haunting secrets.
- About our parents. And your parents, too.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.333
We were right. Everything is connected.

02:51.416 --> 02:53.208
Well, what did you learn?

02:53.291 --> 02:55.041
Tell us when you're safe.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.416
We heard Olaf's plan.

02:56.500 --> 03:00.000
He'll hide us in an item at the In Auction
and sneak us out of the city tomorrow.

03:00.083 --> 03:02.416
No, he's not.
You're coming with us, right now.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.250
I think it's an electromagnetic circuit.
It's not just light, it's heat.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.000
I wonder...

03:09.875 --> 03:12.291
The Incomplete History
of Secret Organizations

03:12.375 --> 03:14.458
said it can be used
for all sorts of things.

03:14.541 --> 03:16.583
Maybe it can melt the lock.

03:29.458 --> 03:31.958
- Did it melt?
- No. It just got hotter.

03:32.041 --> 03:34.833
It's not gonna work.
I can feel it overheating.

03:34.916 --> 03:37.000
There must be something else you can use.

03:37.416 --> 03:38.625
Can you hand me that newspaper?

03:51.875 --> 03:53.000
Heat rises.

03:54.041 --> 03:55.041
What?

03:55.125 --> 03:57.375
- We have to go back to that penthouse.
- You're leaving?

03:57.458 --> 03:59.625
We're gonna find something there
to get you out.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.750
Gather the handkerchief
as tight as you can.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.833
- I see what you mean. Heat rises.
- And so will we.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.541
Sunny and I should stay here.

04:06.625 --> 04:10.083
No, Klaus. Help your sister.
Just come back soon.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.750
- We will.
- We promise.

04:22.458 --> 04:26.666
You saved us at Prufrock.
We'd be in Olaf's clutches if not for you.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.291
- So I'm sure you know.
- What?

04:30.625 --> 04:31.875
What friends are for.

04:42.250 --> 04:45.916
- Hey! You!
- Is just handsome foreign man

04:46.000 --> 04:49.333
and pretty lady dragging
someone unconscious, please.

04:49.416 --> 04:51.291
I thought it might be
something suspicious.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.708
There's still a citywide manhunt.
Did you have a nice evening, Mrs. Squalor?

04:54.791 --> 04:57.666
Oh, my, yes.

04:57.750 --> 05:01.458
There's nothing quite like
a luxurious 46-course lunch

05:01.541 --> 05:05.041
followed by hot pickled fish
and lengthy musical numbers.

05:05.125 --> 05:07.583
You flatter me, please.

05:07.666 --> 05:11.250
Now drag the snoring husband upstairs,
pretty lady.

05:11.333 --> 05:14.375
- I must make arrangements here.
- Righto.

05:14.458 --> 05:17.333
Come on, Jerome. Up, up!

05:20.583 --> 05:21.666
Sorry for being suspicious.

05:21.750 --> 05:24.000
You can't be too careful
with an actor on the loose.

05:25.333 --> 05:29.041
I couldn't agree more.

05:53.458 --> 05:56.708
Let's hope we make it to the top
before the Squalors and Olaf get home.

05:56.791 --> 05:57.791
Can you smell smoke?

06:01.583 --> 06:02.583
The handkerchief!

06:04.458 --> 06:07.208
The fabric is burning.
The heat is too intense.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.375
- What do we do?
- I need to moderate the temperature.

06:09.458 --> 06:12.291
It has to be hot enough to rise
but not so hot that it burns.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.958
That sounds very specific.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.791
- How far from the top are we?
- Not close enough.

06:17.833 --> 06:19.333
How high up are we?

06:24.083 --> 06:25.208
I'm gonna fix this.

06:34.708 --> 06:35.583
Come on.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.750
If I turn it on and off,
it might stabilize.

06:58.333 --> 07:01.916
Okay, okay. It's... it's working.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.166
If we maintain a consistent heat level,
we should make it.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.083
For a second, I thought we...

07:24.166 --> 07:25.166
Sunny.

07:28.541 --> 07:32.666
I saw a circular saw in the penthouse.
We can use it to cut the bars.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.625
- Olaf.
- He can't know we've found them.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.666
- Jerome!
- What happened to him?

07:45.750 --> 07:50.708
Nothing to worry about, darlings.
He just collapsed in the middle of dinner.

07:51.541 --> 07:53.375
- Collapsed?
- Fell sound asleep.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.916
You should be asleep, too.
It's whatever time it is.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.666
- Is Gunther here?
- Who? No, no.

08:10.458 --> 08:12.208
Do you smell something? Like a...

08:12.791 --> 08:14.791
school librarian smell?

08:14.875 --> 08:17.291
- Jerome, wake up.
- Let him rest.

08:17.375 --> 08:20.625
Sleep is natural,
like cosmetics or frivolous lawsuits.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.416
- We need to tell him something important.
- Tell me. I'm important.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.958
And you're important to me.

08:32.416 --> 08:35.500
I know I seem
like an insanely powerful woman

08:35.582 --> 08:39.666
who spends too much time at work
and too much money on earrings.

08:39.750 --> 08:43.832
But I'm also your guardian.
You can tell me anything.

08:43.916 --> 08:46.000
Well, you might not believe us.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.333
Try me.

08:48.916 --> 08:52.000
"Opening night at Herring Houdini was
a success the size of the Hindenburg."

08:52.083 --> 08:54.791
"This fishy, very in restaurant
attracted a crowd ranging

08:54.875 --> 08:59.000
from the city's most prominent bankers
to the most prominent financial advisors."

09:02.083 --> 09:03.666
- Herring Houdini.
- It's me, idiot.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.166
- Oh, hey!
- Something's fishy.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.625
Why are you hanging
around that restaurant?

09:06.708 --> 09:08.000
- I'm sorry.
- There's a new plan.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.416
- Get a big net. And fast. Goodbye.
- The biggest net we can find. Okay. Bye.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.875
He already hung up. Okay.

09:13.625 --> 09:15.333
Hey! Get the net!

09:18.666 --> 09:22.458
This is terrible. Let me understand.
Gunther is Olaf in disguise?

09:22.541 --> 09:25.458
His boot covers his tattoo,
and his sunglasses hide his eyebrow.

09:25.541 --> 09:28.541
He's hidden your friends in a cage
at the bottom of my elevator.

09:28.625 --> 09:30.750
There's no elevator
behind those doors. It's ersatz.

09:30.833 --> 09:31.666
Gesundheit.

09:31.750 --> 09:34.416
He plans to sneak them
out of town at the In Auction

09:34.500 --> 09:37.541
by hiding them inside an item
in this glossy, classy catalog?

09:40.625 --> 09:43.166
This is the least in thing
I have ever heard.

09:44.708 --> 09:46.166
This is a complicated plot.

09:46.250 --> 09:49.375
I'm surprised children
like yourselves figured it out.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.875
Your bravery and smarts are remarkable.
I need a drink.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.166
Parsley soda.

09:58.250 --> 10:01.625
The Daily Punctilio says it's
the innest thing since aqueous martinis.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.416
- Try it.
- No, thank...

10:03.500 --> 10:04.750
Try it.

10:10.583 --> 10:13.666
- What do you think?
- It tastes like parsley.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.708
Isn't it remarkable?
I taste the same thing.

10:15.791 --> 10:17.458
- Mrs. Squalor...
- Esmé.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.125
- Esmé.
- I know what you're going to say.

10:20.208 --> 10:21.916
There isn't time
to drink savory beverages.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.166
We must end this terrible scheme.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.000
We will have Gunther arrested
and the Quagmires set free.

10:27.083 --> 10:30.208
Put down your drinks.
There's no time to waste.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.083
We've got to tell the police
as quickly as possible.

10:35.166 --> 10:37.500
Luckily,
the nearest police station isn't far away.

10:37.583 --> 10:40.833
It's too bad we've got to
take all those stairs again.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.166
We could slide down the banister,

10:42.250 --> 10:43.875
which would be quicker,
though less dignified.

10:43.958 --> 10:48.083
Oh! I know! We'll take the elevator.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.125
In times of dire circumstance,

10:51.208 --> 10:55.666
I have to remind myself that whatever
distress or heartbreak I might experience,

10:55.750 --> 10:59.208
I can take some comfort that I am not,
as the Baudelaires once were,

10:59.291 --> 11:03.708
falling down an elevator shaft
for an interminable amount of time...

11:10.000 --> 11:13.291
...only to land
with a sort of panicky relief into a net.

11:20.875 --> 11:22.541
- We're okay.
- What?

11:22.625 --> 11:24.791
We're okay. We landed in a net.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.083
We're not okay. We're not half-okay.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.958
We're not even 1/27th okay.

11:29.041 --> 11:30.208
Our friends are kidnapped

11:30.291 --> 11:32.375
and our guardian threw us
down an elevator shaft!

11:32.458 --> 11:33.375
We're alive.

11:33.458 --> 11:38.583
You are alive, Baudelaires,
but you are definitely not okay.

11:38.666 --> 11:42.833
You and the Quagmires
are going to be smuggled out of town,

11:42.916 --> 11:48.375
and I can guarantee
that you orphans will never be okay again!

11:48.833 --> 11:49.791
What...

11:52.333 --> 11:53.166
Line?

11:53.250 --> 11:55.583
- "What a wonderful..."
- Yes, yes, yes.

11:55.666 --> 11:58.625
What a wonderful and profitable day!

11:58.708 --> 12:01.166
Count Olaf, my former acting coach,

12:01.250 --> 12:07.375
will finally get his hands on not one
but two enormous fortunes!

12:07.458 --> 12:10.833
Your former acting coach?

12:10.916 --> 12:13.666
You knew Gunther's identity
the entire time?

12:13.750 --> 12:17.250
Course I did. I'm an actor.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.416
I was acting.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.666
I had to fool you
and my dim-witted husband

12:22.750 --> 12:24.916
into thinking he was an auctioneer.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.833
You really are starting
to grow as a thesbian.

12:27.916 --> 12:29.000
Thesbian?

12:29.833 --> 12:31.791
Well, I do love horses.

12:31.875 --> 12:33.583
You are our guardian!

12:33.666 --> 12:36.625
You're supposed to keep us safe,
not throw us down elevator shafts,

12:36.708 --> 12:38.791
work with villains
and try to steal our fortune!

12:47.083 --> 12:49.333
But I want to steal from you.

12:49.416 --> 12:54.291
I want to steal from you
the way Beatrice stole from me!

12:55.166 --> 12:56.500
What did you say?

13:00.541 --> 13:04.916
- I barely know anything about any of this.
- Let me bring you up to speed.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.125
The Quagmire kidnapping
is the result of a murder

13:07.208 --> 13:10.333
which is the result of an arson,
a moving violation,

13:10.416 --> 13:13.666
a misdemeanor, two poison darts,
three civil suits and a stolen object.

13:14.416 --> 13:16.125
The world is complicated.

13:16.208 --> 13:18.750
- That's usually the case.
- Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

13:18.833 --> 13:22.291
Maybe I should go back to my library,
where things are safe and organized,

13:22.375 --> 13:23.708
if also lonely and unfulfilled.

13:23.791 --> 13:26.208
As a cab driver, I have to take you
where you want to go.

13:26.291 --> 13:29.208
But as a volunteer,
I don't want to take you back to Prufrock.

13:29.291 --> 13:31.625
- You're needed, Olivia Caliban.
- Why?

13:32.458 --> 13:35.291
I can show you, but once you see it,
it'll be hard to turn back.

13:35.375 --> 13:36.333
Is it far?

13:36.416 --> 13:38.666
I'll have to turn back.
Hang on to something sturdy.

13:49.583 --> 13:54.625
A story that began with a stolen object,
a moving violation, a misdemeanor,

13:54.708 --> 13:57.791
two poison darts and three civil suits,
settled out of court...

13:57.875 --> 14:00.083
Ends with three orphans in a net

14:00.166 --> 14:03.000
and two more being dragged
to the auction house.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.875
I love a happy ending.

14:04.958 --> 14:07.166
It's like Wuthering Heights,
which I never read.

14:07.750 --> 14:12.541
Olaf, darling, it's been
so lonely living in a penthouse

14:12.625 --> 14:15.333
with nothing but insane wealth and luxury,

14:15.416 --> 14:17.458
and a husband I married
for complicated reasons

14:17.541 --> 14:19.125
and also an elevator.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.333
If I knew adopting the Baudelaires
would bring you back,

14:22.416 --> 14:23.625
I would've orphaned them myself.

14:23.708 --> 14:27.916
To the star of a citywide manhunt

14:28.000 --> 14:31.875
and the incredibly stylish woman
who found him again after all this time.

14:31.958 --> 14:36.500
To us, my darling,
and to the taste of victory.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.250
What's in this?

14:44.666 --> 14:48.375
- It's parsley, darling. Parsley soda.
- Parsley? Why would...

14:48.958 --> 14:50.583
Hmm...

14:50.833 --> 14:52.875
Have you never heard of banana daiquiris?

14:52.958 --> 14:55.500
- Bananas aren't in.
- We'll see about that.

14:56.666 --> 15:00.291
Now that we've fooled the city
and knocked your husband unconscious,

15:01.166 --> 15:02.958
I think it's time...

15:04.500 --> 15:05.583
Oh.

15:05.666 --> 15:07.000
For a little...

15:10.916 --> 15:12.791
Celebratory dancing.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.958
- What?
- If you're up for it.

15:18.041 --> 15:19.333
Oh.

15:20.541 --> 15:23.541
Okay, yes. Dancing sounds fun.

15:23.625 --> 15:24.833
Why? What did you...

15:24.916 --> 15:27.666
Dancing, yes!
Dancing. That's what I was...

15:27.750 --> 15:31.000
An evening of dancing.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.250
- Duncan?
- Isadora?

15:50.625 --> 15:51.833
Why aren't they answering?

15:51.916 --> 15:53.291
Maybe Olaf took them
when he set up this net.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.291
We won't know unless we go down.

15:55.375 --> 15:59.583
- We could use this net as a climbing rope.
- It might not be long enough.

15:59.666 --> 16:03.041
- Or strong enough.
- If we can't go down, can we go up?

16:03.958 --> 16:07.125
The piping is too small to grip.
Unless you had...

16:07.208 --> 16:08.291
Very small hands.

16:11.166 --> 16:13.708
- Sunny, no!
- Sunny, it's too dangerous.

16:19.750 --> 16:20.708
- Sunny, no!
- Sunny!

16:35.000 --> 16:36.500
I can't believe it.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.916
That our baby sister
is climbing up an elevator shaft

16:39.000 --> 16:41.541
- with the help of her teeth?
- I can't believe any of it.

16:45.375 --> 16:48.041
It may be difficult to believe,
but at any moment,

16:48.125 --> 16:50.833
someone somewhere is
in a dangerous situation

16:50.916 --> 16:54.791
and other people in some other place
are dancing and having a good time.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.791
The world is often like this.

16:57.875 --> 17:01.333
A celebration here,
terrible trouble just outside the door,

17:01.416 --> 17:05.333
but elsewhere,
a chance to end a villain's treachery.

17:05.415 --> 17:08.790
- Let's do some reading.
- A kidnapping underground...

17:08.875 --> 17:11.915
- It's this way.
- Are you sure? Let me see the map.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.750
Let us out.
You won't get away with this.

17:13.833 --> 17:14.915
And in a penthouse...

17:16.250 --> 17:17.875
a daring escape.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.790
The management regrets
it cannot allow orphans to escape.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.583
What does "perfidy" mean?

17:29.125 --> 17:30.083
Oh.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.916
You're clever,
and you're good with your teeth.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.583
Play your cards right, you could join us

17:36.666 --> 17:38.875
instead of surrendering your fortune
and your life.

17:40.916 --> 17:43.250
Where do you think you're going? Hey!

17:52.791 --> 17:55.416
We've been dancing a while.
Maybe we could...

17:55.500 --> 17:56.708
Twirl? Absolutely.

18:19.958 --> 18:22.583
Darling, these boots must be killing you.

18:23.416 --> 18:27.375
- Why don't you unlace them and...
- High kick? I couldn't agree more!

18:45.208 --> 18:46.833
I'm coming for you, baby!

18:48.375 --> 18:51.041
- Do you hear something?
- Probably the maracas.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.458
You are in big trouble!

19:04.083 --> 19:05.541
What am I supposed to do with this?

19:11.125 --> 19:12.208
Oh.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.583
Oh, no!
You're not bribing your way out of this.

19:14.666 --> 19:17.083
How will I explain
why you're not in that shaft?

19:21.666 --> 19:23.458
Oh, well, that worked out.

19:23.541 --> 19:26.125
- I think I found something.
- "VFD."

19:26.208 --> 19:28.208
The Quagmires said it
when they were kidnapped.

19:28.291 --> 19:30.541
- It must be important.
- Olaf must be using Lot 49

19:30.625 --> 19:32.750
to smuggle them out of town.

19:32.833 --> 19:35.375
- What does VFD stand for?
- I wish I knew.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.083
- You're safe.
- Did you get help?

19:53.458 --> 19:55.916
- The Devil's Tongue knot?
- The Devil's Tongue knot.

20:06.666 --> 20:10.791
They're gone. We left them alone,
and we've lost them again.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.541
We haven't lost them yet.

20:22.958 --> 20:25.791
- We don't know where it goes.
- We know where he's taking them.

20:25.875 --> 20:26.916
Veblen Hall.

20:28.583 --> 20:31.166
I hope there's a way up soon.
It's almost morning.

20:31.250 --> 20:35.333
Why would there be a secret passage here?
Do you think Jerome knows?

20:35.416 --> 20:38.125
I bet Esmé does.
That's probably why Count Olaf knows.

20:39.333 --> 20:40.833
- What do you think Esmé meant...
- Look.

20:51.916 --> 20:52.958
Ashes?

21:00.416 --> 21:02.291
- That was Olaf.
- Are you sure?

21:02.375 --> 21:04.375
You saw the tattoo. Who else could it be?

21:11.625 --> 21:13.666
- Now I know.
- Now you know.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.125
- But a sugar bowl?
- A sugar bowl.

21:15.208 --> 21:18.208
It's hard to believe something so small
could cause so much devastation.

21:18.291 --> 21:19.791
Or the loss of so many lives.

21:19.875 --> 21:22.416
I'm not gonna lie.
What we do is dangerous.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.833
I've lost friends, associates...

21:24.916 --> 21:26.875
- Even a brother.
- Then why do it?

21:26.958 --> 21:28.416
Someone has to take up the torch.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.291
There are fires all over, Olivia,

21:30.375 --> 21:32.625
and we need people
who know how to put them out.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.500
I believe you are one of those people.

21:36.458 --> 21:39.708
This started with a sugar bowl
stolen from Esmé Squalor,

21:39.791 --> 21:41.750
but it can end with Count Olaf.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.000
- You're with us?
- I'm with you.

21:43.083 --> 21:45.041
- To the bitter end?
- Will it be bitter?

21:45.125 --> 21:46.916
- We won't know until we get there.
- How fast?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.208
How fast can you drive?

21:53.750 --> 21:55.166
Maybe the Quagmires are up there.

22:16.333 --> 22:17.916
- What?
- How?

22:25.541 --> 22:28.291
- It's our home.
- Why would there be a secret tunnel

22:28.375 --> 22:30.833
from an elevator shaft
at 667 Dark Avenue...

22:32.666 --> 22:33.666
to our home?

22:39.250 --> 22:40.458
"What does it mean?"

22:40.541 --> 22:44.708
I wish I could answer
Sunny Baudelaire's important question.

22:44.791 --> 22:48.500
Opening a secret hatch
into the remains of the Baudelaire home

22:48.583 --> 22:50.916
is like opening a mysterious box

22:51.000 --> 22:54.375
that I have had in my possession
for many years.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.958
Inside the box is a map.

22:57.458 --> 23:00.583
I have spent many hours
going over the dotted lines

23:00.666 --> 23:02.625
indicating the underground tunnel

23:02.708 --> 23:06.583
that begins at the ersatz elevator shaft
of 667 Dark Avenue

23:06.666 --> 23:08.625
and leads to the Baudelaire home.

23:08.708 --> 23:11.875
- Our parents couldn't have known.
- Could they?

23:18.875 --> 23:22.000
Sunny's right. We'd better hurry.
The auction already started.

23:22.750 --> 23:25.833
The auction,
please, has started.

23:25.916 --> 23:29.166
As you can see, Lot Número One-o

23:29.250 --> 23:34.333
is a wanted poster for notorious
good-looking villain named Count Olaf.

23:34.416 --> 23:37.666
Let's start it at five. Do we hear five?

23:40.666 --> 23:41.666
Five?

23:45.583 --> 23:46.875
Is that a... No.

23:48.541 --> 23:50.916
Four and a half? It's beautiful poster.

23:53.666 --> 23:54.750
We could add a pack of gum.

24:01.625 --> 24:05.125
Out of the way!
I'm trying to get somewhere quickly.

24:05.208 --> 24:06.041
Mr. Poe?

24:07.958 --> 24:10.916
Baudelaires?
Why are you here and so dusty?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.458
"Baudelaire Orphans
Covered in Ashes!"

24:13.541 --> 24:17.375
Wait until the readers
of the Daily Punctilio hear about this!

24:17.458 --> 24:19.916
There's no time to explain.
You need to give us a ride.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.333
I can't possibly give you a ride.

24:22.416 --> 24:25.666
- I'm running late to the In Auction.
- That's where we need to go.

24:25.750 --> 24:29.208
I don't know, dear.
It says the auction is invitation only.

24:29.291 --> 24:32.416
Oh, no. It's a charitable function,
so let's be charitable.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.708
I'll try and get you in as my guests.

24:34.791 --> 24:36.958
Don't get ashes on the upholstery.

24:40.750 --> 24:46.875
This red herring fish
will be a lovely addition to any home

24:46.958 --> 24:51.375
or place of business or,
how do you say, dentist office lobby.

24:51.458 --> 24:55.916
- In old country, fish is called seafood.
- Good point, Gunther.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.250
The catalog lists a solid gold salmon,

24:58.333 --> 25:01.291
but we threw that in the garbage
now that herring is in.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.416
We need to bid on an item.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.208
Oh... I don't think so.

25:05.291 --> 25:08.958
I'm glad you're showing interest
in activities of the upper-middle class,

25:09.041 --> 25:13.041
but I can't condone spending
large sums of money on frivolous items.

25:13.125 --> 25:16.458
Look, dear,
a wooden spoon with googly eyes!

25:16.541 --> 25:17.916
We'll bid high.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Enjoy the show.

25:19.541 --> 25:21.541
Halt there. You're not on the list.

25:21.625 --> 25:24.250
Olaf wants us captured.
If you let us in...

25:24.333 --> 25:27.083
- That's like capturing us.
- I need to think about this.

25:27.166 --> 25:29.625
Excuse me, but we're wealthy
and don't like to wait.

25:29.708 --> 25:31.375
I hear eight and a half.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.666
Eight and a half from Mr. Fellini.

25:33.750 --> 25:38.750
I'd like to bid on that red herring
for Herring Houdini, where I work.

25:38.833 --> 25:42.583
Sold! To restaurant person
for unknown amount to be paid later.

25:42.666 --> 25:45.166
Next item is Lot 48.

25:45.250 --> 25:51.833
A vase adorned with flower things.
Very fragile, very in.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.708
I bid 20!

26:05.583 --> 26:11.250
We proceed as normal, please,
to the crying of Lot 49.

26:11.333 --> 26:14.125
- Lot 49. That's VFD.
- We're not too late.

26:14.208 --> 26:16.250
Can we use our fortune to bid?

26:16.333 --> 26:19.208
Your parents' will has
no provision for public sales.

26:19.291 --> 26:22.791
Can't you bid on it for us?
Our friends' lives depend on it.

26:22.875 --> 26:26.416
You shouldn't use hyperbole.
But I could make a modest bid.

26:26.500 --> 26:28.250
I did receive that promotion.

26:28.333 --> 26:31.833
- Yes, you did.
- What in the world is VFD?

26:32.958 --> 26:35.041
Larry Your-Waiter.
Did you get past the bouncer?

26:35.125 --> 26:38.333
Not yet. He has to let me in.
I'm on the list.

26:38.416 --> 26:39.916
Yessica Haircut.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.458
Our agents infiltrated the auction.

26:41.541 --> 26:43.166
If we hurry, we can help.

26:43.250 --> 26:46.041
- I'm going 60 in a 55 zone.
- Floor it.

26:46.125 --> 26:48.708
This lengthy chronicle of woe
and unpleasantness ends today.

26:48.791 --> 26:54.916
VFD, of course, needs no introduction,
as is known all over the world

26:55.000 --> 26:58.041
in countries that are foreign
and not so foreign.

26:58.125 --> 26:59.875
Parsley soda?

27:07.000 --> 27:11.958
As you see, is prime specimen, this VFD.

27:12.041 --> 27:16.083
Very large with a few air holes
poked in the top at the last minute.

27:16.166 --> 27:19.416
Ladies, please turn
the box around on all sides

27:19.500 --> 27:22.416
so everyone can see all of the angles.

27:22.500 --> 27:26.916
Actually, I identify as a man.

27:29.125 --> 27:33.500
Where is women of advanced age, please?
And the other guy?

27:33.583 --> 27:36.000
One with, how do you say,
alternative fingers?

27:36.083 --> 27:37.333
Let's start the bidding.

27:37.416 --> 27:40.958
Yes, Gunther. That's what
any legitimate auctioneer would do.

27:44.291 --> 27:47.000
Very well, please.
What is first bid, please?

27:47.083 --> 27:48.750
I bid 20.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.083
- Fifty.
- Fifty-five.

27:51.166 --> 27:54.458
We have a bid of 55 from unhelpful banker.

27:54.541 --> 27:55.458
Sixty!

27:55.541 --> 27:58.875
- You're bidding against me.
- It'd look nice in the powder room.

28:01.125 --> 28:02.500
- Seventy.
- Eighty.

28:02.583 --> 28:04.000
- Ninety.
- Oh, goodness.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.791
It's getting expensive.
Are you sure you want it?

28:06.875 --> 28:09.250
- Please, Mr. Poe.
- Very well, then.

28:10.041 --> 28:12.583
One hundred. And that's my final offer!

28:13.875 --> 28:16.125
- 112.
- 113.

28:16.208 --> 28:18.458
- 119.
- 121.

28:18.541 --> 28:20.083
120.

28:21.291 --> 28:23.000
Darling, 120 is less than 121.

28:24.583 --> 28:25.958
- It is?
- Yes!

28:27.666 --> 28:31.291
Okay, sorry. I bid 200.

28:31.375 --> 28:33.875
What do I care? It's not my money.

28:33.958 --> 28:37.000
I'm sorry, but I cannot
let you bid any higher.

28:37.083 --> 28:40.041
- I don't want to spoil you.
- Let someone else have a turn.

28:40.125 --> 28:44.583
I have bid of 200, please,
from someone who will be yelled at later.

28:44.666 --> 28:47.416
- Pack it up and take it away, please.
- Not so fast.

28:49.250 --> 28:51.916
- Jerome?
- Yes, darling. I'm sorry I'm late.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.833
I could not get off the sofa.
It must have been something I ate.

28:56.625 --> 28:58.333
I've had pickled herring problems myself.

28:58.416 --> 29:00.416
Hello, everyone. I'm Jerome,

29:00.500 --> 29:05.375
and I am proudly a legal guardian
of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire.

29:05.458 --> 29:07.625
In the short time
they have been under my care,

29:07.708 --> 29:10.625
I have been impressed
with their intelligence,

29:10.708 --> 29:12.625
their fortitude and their charm.

29:13.291 --> 29:14.666
At least while I was awake.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.083
They're noble children,
like their parents.

29:19.125 --> 29:23.000
Therefore, if they're interested in
a cardboard box with air holes in it,

29:23.083 --> 29:25.458
I'm going to make sure they get it.

29:26.250 --> 29:27.250
204!

29:27.333 --> 29:29.541
Love of my life, don't be an idiot.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.833
You don't know what is going on. 205.

29:31.916 --> 29:36.625
Esmé, love of my life, I am tired
of being treated this way. 206.

29:36.708 --> 29:41.541
Well, maybe I'm tired of you! 207!

29:41.625 --> 29:44.333
Maybe I'm tired of both of you! 208.

29:44.416 --> 29:48.000
I'm tired of failure and hopelessness
in the face of treachery and doom! 209!

29:48.083 --> 29:50.833
I'm tired of self-indulgent
existential crises

29:50.916 --> 29:54.000
and an overabundance
of hardcover books! 210.

29:56.875 --> 29:58.083
212!

29:58.166 --> 29:59.333
Snicket.

29:59.416 --> 30:01.875
You're not on the list. 213!

30:01.958 --> 30:04.666
I have a splitting headache.
214 and a half!

30:04.750 --> 30:07.958
I have a degree
in welterweight boxing. 215!

30:08.041 --> 30:10.208
So do we! 216!

30:10.291 --> 30:14.291
I don't know why my secretary
is fighting those two old ladies! 217!

30:14.375 --> 30:16.125
218 that I took from my husband's wallet!

30:16.208 --> 30:17.416
219!

30:17.500 --> 30:18.833
A quarter past 11:00.

30:18.916 --> 30:21.750
I got quarter past 11:00
from person I no longer have to yell at!

30:21.833 --> 30:23.625
Going once, going twice...

30:26.541 --> 30:28.250
What did she say?

30:28.333 --> 30:30.250
She said 1,000.

30:30.333 --> 30:31.208
Oh!

30:35.416 --> 30:37.541
Where did Sunny get that kind of money?

30:37.625 --> 30:40.041
She was a receptionist in boarding school,

30:40.125 --> 30:41.958
but I had no idea
her salary was that high.

30:42.041 --> 30:45.291
The bid is 1,000.

30:45.375 --> 30:50.166
Please. Let the little baby
give the big money to the pretty lady,

30:50.250 --> 30:51.666
and the auction is over.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.916
The only thing that's over
is your horrible plan.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.250
How dare you?

30:57.833 --> 30:58.958
Ah-ah-ah.

30:59.041 --> 31:02.333
You can't open this box until
you give me the money. That's illegal.

31:02.416 --> 31:05.791
- What's illegal is auctioning children.
- Not everywhere.

31:05.875 --> 31:09.333
The room will see you've broken the law
and our friends are in this box.

31:09.416 --> 31:13.833
The Quagmires? Wait till the readers
of the Daily Punctilio hear about this!

31:13.916 --> 31:15.250
- Baudelaires!
- Duncan!

31:15.333 --> 31:18.583
- Isadora!
- Quagmires! Quagmires!

31:38.208 --> 31:42.583
- Doilies?
- Inside the box were... doilies?

31:42.666 --> 31:47.291
Of course! "Very fancy doilies."
What else could VFD stand for?

31:48.250 --> 31:52.583
Yes. What in the world, please,
could VFD stand for, dusty orphans?

31:52.666 --> 31:55.791
Someone put these children
in a long black automobile.

31:55.875 --> 31:57.875
They're dirty
and their clothes are frayed.

31:57.958 --> 32:01.750
- So are his!
- Frayed? I'm afraid not.

32:01.833 --> 32:04.583
Whoa! I'm a... Oh!

32:06.291 --> 32:08.416
He has an eye tattoo on his ankle!

32:09.208 --> 32:11.958
He's not Gunther!
He's not a foreigner at all!

32:12.041 --> 32:13.250
Arrest this man!

32:13.333 --> 32:16.208
Wait until the readers
of the Daily Punctilio read about this!

32:21.958 --> 32:26.625
Calm down, everyone!
Don't blame foreigners for your problems.

32:26.708 --> 32:31.000
He's not a foreigner! He's from
the same country as we're in right now!

32:31.083 --> 32:33.250
That's no reason to arrest someone.

32:33.333 --> 32:34.708
He's a criminal. That's enough.

32:34.791 --> 32:38.333
Klaus is right!
He's the subject of a citywide manhunt!

32:38.916 --> 32:40.875
He's a source of pain and suffering,

32:40.958 --> 32:44.750
not to mention hours of negotiations
at Mulctuary Money Management.

32:44.833 --> 32:49.333
Wait! Before you rush to judgment,
there's something I need to share.

32:52.958 --> 32:55.291
All my life,
I've climbed the ladder of success

32:55.375 --> 32:58.833
armed only with ruthless ambition
and a large inheritance.

32:58.916 --> 33:00.541
I've paid my dues for weeks

33:00.625 --> 33:04.125
to become the city's
sixth most important financial advisor,

33:04.208 --> 33:09.333
to become this statuesque powerhouse
that stands gorgeously before you.

33:12.916 --> 33:19.541
I had the whole world
at my remarkably small feet. And yet...

33:24.125 --> 33:26.750
I had a feeling
there was something missing.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.833
It wasn't until I opened my home
to three orphans

33:37.916 --> 33:40.833
that I realized just exactly what it was.

33:40.916 --> 33:42.291
Aw!

33:45.125 --> 33:50.125
It was Count Olaf! He's a genius!
He's a wonderful acting coach!

33:50.208 --> 33:54.166
He's back in my life
after many lonely and successful years,

33:54.250 --> 33:57.000
helping me pursue single-minded,
cold-hearted,

33:57.083 --> 33:59.291
perhaps slightly overzealous revenge.

34:00.125 --> 34:03.500
My boyfriend, Count Olaf.

34:03.583 --> 34:07.291
The handsomest, innest man in town.

34:07.375 --> 34:10.916
How could you say something like that?
You're my wife!

34:11.000 --> 34:14.166
And besides,
ruthless kidnappers aren't in!

34:14.250 --> 34:17.333
How right you are. We're not in.

34:17.416 --> 34:20.916
We're out. Out of the city, that is!
Come on, Esmé!

34:21.000 --> 34:24.041
Don't let the despicable man
escape for a sixth time!

34:25.083 --> 34:28.083
- It's all over.
- Veblen Hall is the end of the line.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.916
"Veblen Hall Out,
Milton Friedman Hall In!"

34:42.250 --> 34:44.083
No. No!

34:46.291 --> 34:48.416
We better clear out
before we're swimming upstream.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.291
- What about Olaf?
- I know where to find him.

34:50.375 --> 34:53.458
Veblen Hall might be the end of the line,
but it's the start of a tunnel.

35:00.708 --> 35:01.791
They have our friends.

35:01.875 --> 35:04.416
But you said the Quagmires
were inside that box of doilies.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.583
- I guess that wasn't his plan.
- That wasn't his plan.

35:07.666 --> 35:09.666
- It was a red herring.
- It was a red herring.

35:11.208 --> 35:12.458
Red herring.

35:12.541 --> 35:13.625
Red herring!

35:17.000 --> 35:21.083
The words "red herring" do not only refer
to a type of foraging fish

35:21.166 --> 35:22.791
that may have a crimson hue

35:22.875 --> 35:25.583
due to being smoked or painted
with excessive nail polish.

35:25.666 --> 35:28.791
They can also refer to a distracting
or misleading clue,

35:28.875 --> 35:33.166
such as a box marked VFD that had
nothing to do with a secret organization

35:33.250 --> 35:35.166
or a pair of kidnapped triplets.

35:35.958 --> 35:39.625
For instance, if I told you
that two brave and noble volunteers

35:39.708 --> 35:42.791
were giving chase to Count Olaf
and his kidnapping victims...

35:42.875 --> 35:44.916
- By George!
- Heavens to Betsy!

35:45.000 --> 35:47.041
That's not my name either.

35:47.125 --> 35:48.791
That would be a red herring,

35:48.875 --> 35:51.458
because it would imply
that Olaf was about to be captured,

35:51.541 --> 35:53.625
which, I'm sorry to say, was not the case.

35:59.375 --> 36:02.333
If I told you the city's
most prominent journalists

36:02.416 --> 36:05.958
and banking vice presidents
were also giving chase...

36:06.041 --> 36:08.125
Wait until the readers
of the Daily Punctilio

36:08.208 --> 36:10.208
hear about whatever just happened.

36:12.166 --> 36:13.500
That would be a red herring.

36:13.583 --> 36:16.750
It would imply the Quagmires
were about to be rescued,

36:16.833 --> 36:19.625
which I'm sorrier to say
was also not the case.

36:20.708 --> 36:22.541
- Duncan!
- Isadora!

36:22.625 --> 36:26.083
If I told you the Baudelaires
were about to be offered a safe home,

36:26.916 --> 36:28.625
that would be a red herring, too.

36:29.875 --> 36:31.375
Baudelaires! Baudelaires,

36:31.458 --> 36:35.458
it's not safe for you to chase
a dangerous villain or her boyfriend.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.375
We need to rescue our friends.

36:37.458 --> 36:40.166
Let the authorities.
It's a citywide manhunt.

36:40.250 --> 36:42.500
Olaf was here
and the authorities didn't notice.

36:42.583 --> 36:43.541
Don't be hard on them.

36:43.625 --> 36:46.583
You didn't recognize Olaf
until it was too late.

36:46.666 --> 36:50.750
But I'm awake now, from Esmé's treachery
and after a very long nap,

36:50.833 --> 36:52.500
and I'm still your guardian.

36:52.583 --> 36:56.375
And from now on, I promise
you can forget all about Count Olaf.

36:56.458 --> 36:58.291
We'll never forget about him.

36:58.375 --> 37:00.500
We'll never forget our friends.
We have to rescue them.

37:00.583 --> 37:04.166
And find the truth about the tunnel
between your elevator and our house.

37:05.625 --> 37:08.166
You are in far too much danger,
Baudelaires.

37:08.833 --> 37:12.000
I know you're worried about your friends.
I know.

37:12.083 --> 37:14.750
But let other people
track down Count Olaf.

37:14.833 --> 37:17.916
- Let me keep you safe.
- Nowhere is safe with Olaf at large.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.958
We'll never be happy
if our friends are in danger.

37:20.041 --> 37:22.333
We are going to find them.
You can help us.

37:24.833 --> 37:26.041
Please?

37:27.875 --> 37:29.458
I wish I had your courage.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.958
Your mother always said
I wasn't brave enough.

37:33.041 --> 37:34.500
I guess she was right.

37:36.416 --> 37:37.625
She was also right about Esmé,

37:37.708 --> 37:39.583
who only married me
for my underground tunnel.

37:42.416 --> 37:46.250
I wish you luck.
I think you're going to need it.

38:11.666 --> 38:14.500
- Where is Mr. Squalor going?
- It doesn't matter.

38:14.583 --> 38:17.041
I don't think he wants
to be our guardian anymore.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.041
Normally, that would be cause for alarm,

38:22.125 --> 38:25.750
but we at Mulctuary Money Management
are exploring guardian options

38:25.833 --> 38:28.916
after an uptick in mysterious fires
destroying people's homes.

38:29.625 --> 38:34.166
There's a town far, far from here offering
to care for our orphaned clientele.

38:34.250 --> 38:37.583
A town with a name that I find
both curious and somewhat familiar,

38:38.166 --> 38:39.250
VFD.

38:42.666 --> 38:44.500
- So what do you think?
- Yes.

38:44.583 --> 38:45.750
Lovely.

38:49.250 --> 38:53.666
If I told you that the next destination
for the Baudelaires was labeled VFD,

38:53.750 --> 38:56.375
that too might be
something of a red herring,

38:56.458 --> 38:58.625
because it would imply
that at the conclusion

38:58.708 --> 39:01.375
of this fraught
and frightening episode in their lives,

39:01.458 --> 39:03.958
they were the only ones
heading that direction.

39:04.333 --> 39:08.250
Because while the Baudelaire orphans
would soon be far, far away from here,

39:08.958 --> 39:11.708
they would also be far, far from alone.

39:11.791 --> 39:13.250
Where do you think he'd head?

39:13.333 --> 39:15.708
Somewhere far from here.
But he'd be far from alone.

39:15.791 --> 39:17.875
- And the Baudelaires?
- Their story's not over.

39:18.541 --> 39:20.250
Then what are we waiting for?

39:24.416 --> 39:25.500
A red herring.
