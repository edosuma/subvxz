His name oughta be "Dinner."

03:04.726 --> 03:06.728
Brand, I'm so close.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.480
If I can just get around the T. rex,
I'd beat the game and win the--

03:09.564 --> 03:10.857
Trip to Jurassic World.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.318
I-I know. You've said it,
like, a thousand times.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.653
But if straight-up gamers say
this thing's unwinnable,

03:15.737 --> 03:17.780
how's some dino-nerd kid gonna beat it?

03:18.156 --> 03:20.158
Great pep talk, bro.
You been working on that?

03:20.533 --> 03:24.078
[sighs] Look, Darius, I know
getting to Jurassic World

03:24.162 --> 03:28.166
was your and Dad's dream, but there's
more to life than just dinosaurs.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.293
You never leave your room anymore, bruh.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.961
Dad wouldn't want this.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.718
I hear you, but even if winning
is dumb and hopeless,

03:38.801 --> 03:40.803
I still gotta try, you know?

03:43.348 --> 03:44.432
I guess so, D.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.768
Can you at least, like, take a break?
Maybe work in a shower?

03:46.851 --> 03:49.103
-'Cause you're smelling pretty funky, man.
-[chuckles]

03:49.229 --> 03:52.398

Welcome, campers!

I'm Roxie, head counselor
of Camp Cretaceous.

07:47.592 --> 07:52.305
[chuckles] Well, it's sort of
a co-head counselor sort of situation.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.390
-Is it?
-[clears throat]

07:54.474 --> 07:56.517

but for the next two weeks,

all of you will be getting
the five-star treatment!

Dinosaurs?

08:19.582 --> 08:23.544
Yes... Darius, plenty of dinosaurs.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.838
So, ready for an adventure?

08:26.255 --> 08:27.548
Absolutely!

08:27.632 --> 08:29.634
But I'm gonna need that speech
a little shorter,

08:29.717 --> 08:32.428
and really try to lean
into the majesty of this place.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.847
[chuckles] Okay, we're going now.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.682
Let's get the six of you to camp.

And, action!

10:17.533 --> 10:20.911
I just can't believe... you're Brooklynn!

10:21.454 --> 10:24.874
I'm Sammy Gutierrez, total Brooklander!

10:24.957 --> 10:27.126
Kapow! [imitates gunfire]

10:27.293 --> 10:30.254
Oh, also, my family supplies all the beef
for the park, and that's how I got here.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.881
Great to meet you, Sammy.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.051

call themselves.

10:38.679 --> 10:43.100
Uh, all 27 million of us.
[imitates gunfire]

10:43.934 --> 10:47.813
Yep. That's why she's the only one
who gets to keep her cell phone.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.482
She's famous.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.069

12:12.815 --> 12:13.858
Oh, please.

12:13.941 --> 12:17.111
It took a blanket
and a cat carrier to catch it.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.237
Boring.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.906
-Scared you pretty good.

Wow.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.975

12:50.936 --> 12:53.522
Welcome to Camp Cretaceous.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.123
<i>Hey, Brooklanders, check this place out!</i>

13:53.207 --> 13:56.835
<i>Is this not the most amazing place</i>
<i>you have ever seen?</i>

13:56.919 --> 14:01.340
<i>If you think this is cool, you should see</i>
<i>my dad's penthouse in the main park.</i>

14:03.092 --> 14:04.134
Yasmina!

14:04.218 --> 14:05.094
Hey, girl.

14:05.177 --> 14:10.015
So, as an elite athlete,
how pumped are you for camp?

14:10.099 --> 14:12.017
<i>Not a huge fan of being on camera.</i>

14:13.102 --> 14:14.311
<i>Or people.</i>

14:16.188 --> 14:20.317
This place is almost as big
as my family's ranch back home.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.319
That's because when we're up and running,

14:22.403 --> 14:26.365
the camp will house
500 kids and 150 staff.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.491
Listen up!

14:27.575 --> 14:30.703
Announcement time
from your co-head counselors.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.496
Psst, still not a thing.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.999
Okay, everyone,
there's some ground rules to cover.

14:35.082 --> 14:39.169
Curfew's at 8:00 p.m.,
and lights out at 9:00 p.m. sharp.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.588
-What?
-Lame.

14:40.671 --> 14:41.505
Fine.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.424
This is for your safety.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.260
We are in a dinosaur-filled jungle.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.762
You must always keep your distance,

14:48.846 --> 14:52.099
or you could be seriously hurt,
if not worse.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.434
Define "worse."

14:53.809 --> 14:55.686
Cabins are up that-a-way.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.479
-First one there gets top bunk!
-[Kenji grunts]

14:57.563 --> 15:00.357
-[all laughing]
-[Sammy] Whoo-hoo!

15:00.733 --> 15:02.359
-[shrieks]
-[Roxie] Get this lovely lady

15:02.443 --> 15:03.402
back to her pen.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.821
Her family's probably worried sick.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.657
-[engine starts, revs]
-W-Wait!

15:08.741 --> 15:12.369
Oh, man, I really wanted to get
a closer look at that Compy.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.415
I like your enthusiasm, Darius,
but right now it's "claiming a bunk" time.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.584
So, you know... go claim a bunk.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.295
But it's the first dinosaur
I've ever seen in person

15:21.378 --> 15:24.882
and, I mean, we're here
to see dinosaurs, so...

15:24.965 --> 15:26.383
[rumbling]

15:33.140 --> 15:35.559
Oh, the day is not over, buddy.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.270
-Wow!
-[dinosaurs bellowing]

15:38.354 --> 15:39.438
Dinosaurs!

15:44.026 --> 15:46.403
[Darius laughs] There's Brachiosaurus.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.657
Parasaurolophus. Stegosaurus.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.950
Ankylosaurus!

15:51.033 --> 15:54.411
Wow, you really do know
your stuff, dino-nerd.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.373
Check out the... Brontosaurus.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.291
They don't have those here.
Common mistake.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.044
[Darius gasps] Are those Sinoceratops?

16:02.127 --> 16:03.587
When did you get those?

16:03.671 --> 16:06.340
They are cooking up
all kinds of new dinos in that lab.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.676
Whoa! Where are they herding 'em to?

16:09.176 --> 16:11.679
They're herding them back
to their nighttime enclosures.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.848
Enough banter.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.434
It's zip-line party time!

16:20.396 --> 16:23.816
Me? Maybe Yasmina
should go first, or... Darius?

16:23.899 --> 16:27.987
Uh... Or anyone! I really don't--
[screams]

16:32.157 --> 16:37.913
[all laughing, cheering]

16:40.624 --> 16:43.043
[dinosaurs bellowing]

16:58.183 --> 16:59.393
Wow!

17:02.438 --> 17:04.440
Whoa! [screams]

17:04.523 --> 17:06.650
Whoa!

17:07.067 --> 17:09.111
[cheering continues]

17:09.194 --> 17:12.322
-[Yasmina] Yeah!
-[Kenji cackling]

17:29.256 --> 17:30.924
[snoring]

18:00.704 --> 18:01.872
-[light clicks]
-[Darius gasps]

18:02.122 --> 18:04.750
Oh, hey there, dino-nerd. Whatcha doing?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.210
Huh? Uh, nothing!

18:06.293 --> 18:09.004
I was just, uh, heading out 'cause...

18:09.630 --> 18:10.714
thirsty.

18:13.884 --> 18:17.554
Oh, yeah. I... I meant, um... hungry.

18:18.972 --> 18:22.101
Oh, heh, look at that. Thanks, Kenji.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.728
Look, bro.

18:25.145 --> 18:28.732
I don't want you to be intimidated by me
just because I'm rich,

18:28.816 --> 18:32.528
my father owns a few condos
on the island, and I'm rich.

18:32.611 --> 18:36.073
-Uh, I'm not intimidated by you.
-Oh, good.

18:36.156 --> 18:39.201
I just want us to be friends,
and friends tell each other stuff.

18:39.284 --> 18:43.205
For instance, what they're doing
out of bed after curfew.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.623
What do you think?

18:45.040 --> 18:48.502
I think you best get your arm
off me... friend.

18:48.585 --> 18:51.630
Oh. Why don't you make me, friend?

18:51.755 --> 18:53.257
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[Brooklynn] Huh.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.885
So that's what toxic masculinity
looks like.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.179
Uh, sorry we woke you. I--

18:59.263 --> 19:01.932
He was sneaking out,
but I set him straight.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.017
Look, I try to look out
for the younger kids.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.352
It's who I am.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.563
[Darius] You guys don't understand.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.524
I've been waiting my whole life
to get here,

19:10.607 --> 19:12.693
and I'm gonna make the most of it.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.237
Those lights must be coming
from the Compy enclosure.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.822
I gotta check it out!

19:17.030 --> 19:19.867
Sneaking out to see dinosaurs
in the dead of night,

19:20.325 --> 19:22.119
mad danger of getting caught,

19:22.661 --> 19:24.621
great mood lighting... [sighs]

19:24.705 --> 19:26.331
I guess that means...

19:26.790 --> 19:28.333
we're going rogue.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.543
Kapow!

19:34.339 --> 19:35.215
I think this is it.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.551
The truck definitely headed
this direction.

19:37.634 --> 19:40.053
Of course this is it.
Why else would they have--

19:40.137 --> 19:41.388
[engine starts]

19:41.471 --> 19:42.472
Shh!

20:09.249 --> 20:10.792
[Kenji] Hey, Brooklynn.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.378
You can get a good shot from over here.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.216
-Allow me.
-No, thanks. I can--

20:17.299 --> 20:18.467
-Just-- [grunts]
-Hey!

20:19.176 --> 20:20.427
[Brooklynn] Give me my-- Ugh!

20:20.510 --> 20:21.345
Come on! [gasps]

20:21.929 --> 20:24.097
[bangs, clatters]

20:26.350 --> 20:28.560
Thanks, Kenji. Real smooth.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.979
Relax, I'll get it.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.941
-Wait! What are you--
-I got it, kid.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.870
[grunts]

20:50.457 --> 20:52.542
See? Ha! Good as new.

20:52.751 --> 20:57.047
Great. Now, just climb back up
and gently hand it to me.

20:57.422 --> 21:02.052
Sure, sure, right after I get
a sweet dino-pic for your followers.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.804
No need to thank me.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.309
-[rustling]
-[gasps]

21:12.604 --> 21:14.439
Um, guys...

21:15.816 --> 21:17.150
this isn't the Compy pen.

21:17.734 --> 21:21.029
Quiet, junior!
The grown-ups are talking.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.365
Ah, your followers are gonna love this.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.409
Here, Compy-Compy-Compy.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.202
This isn't the Compy pen!

21:27.369 --> 21:30.455
-Uh, what's he babbling on about?
-[growling]

21:32.374 --> 21:33.667
What the...?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.294
[snarls]

21:46.096 --> 21:48.515
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[screeches]

21:48.807 --> 21:49.808
[screams]

21:50.183 --> 21:52.853
-[roars]
-[screaming]

21:53.562 --> 21:54.604
[Brooklynn] Come on!

21:54.813 --> 21:56.481
-[Kenji pants]
-[grunting]

21:57.024 --> 21:59.901
-[panting]
-[screeches]

21:59.985 --> 22:02.237
-[panting]
-[velociraptor snarling]

22:02.779 --> 22:04.948
D'ah! Open the gate! Open the gate!

22:05.198 --> 22:06.199
[Kenji whimpers]

22:06.825 --> 22:10.954
-[alarm blaring]
-Oh, please! Let me out! [screams]

22:11.079 --> 22:14.791
[grunting] Oh, come on!

22:16.001 --> 22:18.337
-D'ah!
-[snarls]

22:18.420 --> 22:20.881
[hisses]

22:21.298 --> 22:22.591
-[thudding]
-[whimpers]

22:22.674 --> 22:24.968
[grunting]

22:25.052 --> 22:26.303
[steam hissing]

22:27.596 --> 22:30.182
Dude! Please tell me you have a plan.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.726
Let's move!
The steam should keep him busy.

22:33.143 --> 22:33.977
Huh?

22:34.144 --> 22:36.188
[blaring continues]

22:36.271 --> 22:39.649
[screeching]

22:40.525 --> 22:41.902
Oh, crud!

22:43.403 --> 22:45.781
[theme music playing]
