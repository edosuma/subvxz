WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:16.088 --> 01:17.088
Where is Prince Adam?

01:17.103 --> 01:19.154
Well I'm sure he'll be
here, Your Majesty.

01:19.179 --> 01:21.133
He's been very busy lately, uhm...

01:21.158 --> 01:22.329
uh, government problems.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.725
I wouldn't call Lady Amanda a

01:24.750 --> 01:26.836
"government problem"
Hush child.

01:31.851 --> 01:33.524
Cringer, will you come on, we'll be late.

01:35.549 --> 01:38.341
Uh... you go on ahead Adam.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.536
I'm much too tired.

01:40.998 --> 01:43.387
Oh, too tired for a royal fish fry?

01:45.212 --> 01:46.222
Fish fry?

01:48.066 --> 01:49.066
Oh no...

01:49.484 --> 01:52.213
Why must that son of
mine always be late?

01:52.238 --> 01:55.095
Now now, dear,
I'm sure he'll be here any...

02:03.123 --> 02:04.912
Your Majesty, the Prince!

02:06.210 --> 02:08.345
Cringer, are you alright?
Adam !!

02:10.437 --> 02:12.213
Father, I-I'm sorry, I...

02:12.238 --> 02:15.289
Spare me the story, just take your place.

02:17.134 --> 02:19.788
Yes sir.
A fabulous entrance, Adam.

02:20.304 --> 02:22.510
Now that we're all here, let's begin.

02:24.689 --> 02:27.305
Ambassador Therin,
of the Kingdom of Eastfen,

02:27.330 --> 02:29.102
with a gift for His Majesty!

02:31.907 --> 02:33.772
What happened to Ambassador Warne?

02:33.797 --> 02:35.691
I don't know, but there's something

02:35.716 --> 02:37.314
familiar about this Therin.

02:37.339 --> 02:39.586
Something, I can't quite put my finger on.

02:40.951 --> 02:45.336
Your Majesty,
the mild subjects of Eastfen,

02:45.361 --> 02:47.646
wish you to have this humble gift,

02:47.671 --> 02:50.413
made by the finest craftsmen in our land.

02:53.553 --> 02:57.138
Why, it's... it's magnificent!

02:57.163 --> 02:58.585
Would Your Majesty,

02:58.610 --> 03:01.154
care to examine it a bit closer?

03:01.410 --> 03:03.330
By all means, bring it here.

03:05.690 --> 03:07.204
That sword... Skeletor!

03:07.228 --> 03:09.310
Your Majesty, don't touch that!

03:13.230 --> 03:14.230
Father!

03:17.602 --> 03:18.661
Skeletor!

03:18.984 --> 03:21.827
C'mon Cat,
let's find ourselves a quiet spot.

03:23.482 --> 03:24.901
The Weird of Crystal was

03:24.926 --> 03:26.319
meant for you, Randor.

03:26.344 --> 03:27.805
Now I'll have to find another way

03:27.830 --> 03:29.204
to claim the throne of Eternia.

03:29.602 --> 03:32.110
But at least Man-At-Arms won't be a problem

03:32.135 --> 03:33.918
anymore.
You villain!

03:44.798 --> 03:45.997
Cringer, stop!

03:46.922 --> 03:47.922
Well I will,

03:47.945 --> 03:49.937
as soon as I'm far enough away.

03:51.207 --> 03:53.150
By the power of Grayskull!

04:02.775 --> 04:05.094
He can't reach me here.

04:07.319 --> 04:10.133
I have the power!

04:30.399 --> 04:31.459
Guards, take him!

04:41.430 --> 04:42.895
And now for you...

04:45.997 --> 04:47.519
Let her go, bonehead!

04:54.395 --> 04:55.891
Nice move Teela!

04:56.294 --> 04:57.342
I'm not fool enough

04:57.367 --> 04:58.914
to fight you here, He-Man!

04:59.239 --> 05:00.923
But I'll leave you that pretty

05:00.948 --> 05:02.462
statue to remember me by!

05:06.043 --> 05:09.203
He got away... got away!
We'll get him Teela.

05:09.228 --> 05:10.763
But first we gotta find a way to

05:10.788 --> 05:12.467
reverse the spell on your father.

05:12.849 --> 05:15.312
The Sorceress!
She must know a way.

05:15.337 --> 05:16.749
My thoughts exactly,

05:16.774 --> 05:18.686
Your Majesty.
We'll take Man-At-Arms

05:18.711 --> 05:20.416
to Castle Grayskull immediately.

05:28.438 --> 05:30.142
Why doesn't she hurry?

05:30.167 --> 05:32.543
Be patient Teela, we all want

05:32.568 --> 05:34.405
Man-At-Arms back, but linking with

05:34.430 --> 05:36.318
the window of knowledge takes time.

05:38.932 --> 05:40.816
The answer, give us the answer!

05:42.609 --> 05:44.117
I have no answer Teela,

05:44.142 --> 05:46.936
the Weird of Crystal is an ancient magic.

05:46.961 --> 05:48.684
From a time before

05:48.709 --> 05:50.246
Castle Grayskull ever stood.

05:51.032 --> 05:53.264
It's reversal is beyond my power.

05:53.289 --> 05:56.119
Then... then my father is doomed?

05:56.644 --> 05:58.987
Courage Teela, if Skeletor learned the

05:59.012 --> 06:01.174
spell, he must know how to undo it.

06:01.925 --> 06:03.752
Not necessarily,
but there

06:03.777 --> 06:05.792
is one who might know the secret.

06:06.651 --> 06:09.036
Granamyr, oldest and wisest

06:09.061 --> 06:10.319
of the Dragons of Darksmoke.

06:10.444 --> 06:12.917
Then tell us where to find this dragon.

06:13.297 --> 06:15.038
I can't.
You'd leave my

06:15.063 --> 06:16.720
father like this for all eternity?

06:16.745 --> 06:19.239
How could you?
Teela...

06:19.767 --> 06:22.492
She is upset He-Man
and rightly so.

06:22.517 --> 06:24.081
I wish I could help.

06:24.106 --> 06:26.318
But long ago a pact was made between

06:26.343 --> 06:28.046
the Great Dragons and this Castle.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.766
I promised I would not
reveal their whereabouts

06:30.791 --> 06:32.899
to anyone... and to break that

06:32.923 --> 06:34.792
promise, would bring all

06:34.817 --> 06:36.815
their terrible fury down on Eternia!

06:37.234 --> 06:39.878
There must be some way.
When magic

06:39.903 --> 06:42.621
fails, human knowledge may succeed.

06:43.207 --> 06:46.527
I can point you on your journey, and Teela,

06:46.552 --> 06:49.871
I will guard your father until your return.

06:50.363 --> 06:51.364
Thank you.

06:51.389 --> 06:53.027
I'm sorry for what I said.

06:53.052 --> 06:54.243
I know Teela.

06:54.268 --> 06:56.373
Now go and good luck!

07:07.693 --> 07:10.167
He-Man, we're in the royal library!

07:10.192 --> 07:11.993
Human knowledge: Books.

07:12.018 --> 07:13.441
That's what the Sorceress meant.

07:14.221 --> 07:16.144
The old legends will
give us the clue.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.302
Let's start reading...

07:28.647 --> 07:31.238
Teela, I just read that
ice trolls and dragons

07:31.263 --> 07:33.323
are friends.
It's worth checking...

07:33.936 --> 07:34.936
Let's see.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.454
The Ice Mountains.

07:36.479 --> 07:38.556
That's where we'll find Granamyr!

07:38.581 --> 07:40.273
We'll take the Raider across the dark

07:40.298 --> 07:41.990
mountains, then into the Ice Country.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.045
Let's go!

07:52.893 --> 07:54.496
Enjoying the ride, Cat?

07:56.726 --> 07:57.726
Yea.

07:58.921 --> 08:00.821
He-Man, that's it!

08:08.165 --> 08:09.165
A protective field!

08:09.178 --> 08:10.736
The raider's out of control.

08:15.308 --> 08:17.984
I've... got to... turn her...

08:19.309 --> 08:20.549
You did it He-Man!

08:20.574 --> 08:22.226
We still got problems.

08:25.490 --> 08:28.427
Coming in too fast, brace yourselves...

08:39.067 --> 08:41.376
Looks like we'll have to
meet this dragon on foot.

08:58.882 --> 09:00.739
Avalanche!  Go, Cat!

09:02.988 --> 09:05.595
Trouble He-Man, we're on a cliff.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.473
We don't have much of a choice.

09:09.498 --> 09:11.451
I know-w-w.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.792
We should be getting
close to Darksmoke soon.

09:28.417 --> 09:31.027
Uh, strange smell here.

09:34.210 --> 09:35.670
It's an Ice Hacker!

10:08.587 --> 10:09.649
We made it.

10:09.674 --> 10:11.859
Good, I'm frozen stiff.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.967
I'm sure Granamyr will have
a warm fire waiting for us.

10:21.883 --> 10:23.511
Trolls. Watch yourself!

10:23.536 --> 10:25.422
You speak the tongue of Eternia?

10:25.447 --> 10:27.433
Troll talk is tongue of Eternia.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.257
But I talk your speech too.

10:29.665 --> 10:31.330
We want to see Granamyr.

10:31.355 --> 10:32.694
Men don't see Granamyr,

10:32.719 --> 10:34.290
only trolls see Granamyr.

10:37.531 --> 10:39.062
We've got to make that bridge!

10:41.175 --> 10:42.266
I think I see a way to put

10:42.291 --> 10:44.124
these trolls... on ice.

10:48.342 --> 10:50.352
Better move,
before they dig themselves out.

10:57.356 --> 10:59.494
I can't believe how warm it is here.

10:59.519 --> 11:01.641
It must be the dragon's fire pit.

11:26.487 --> 11:29.451
The scent of dragon is strong, He-Man.

11:29.476 --> 11:31.573
I guess we should announce ourselves.

11:31.977 --> 11:32.977
Granamyr!

11:52.215 --> 11:53.804
I am He-Man, great Dragon.

11:53.829 --> 11:55.722
And I'm here to ask your aid.

11:55.923 --> 11:58.659
He-Man? I have heard your name

11:58.684 --> 12:00.575
whispered on the winds of legend.

12:01.043 --> 12:03.239
In that case...
Silence.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.794
I did not say I

12:04.819 --> 12:07.427
respected the name,
only that I'd heard it.

12:07.876 --> 12:09.673
Dragons pay little attention

12:09.698 --> 12:11.213
to the lies of legend.

12:11.238 --> 12:13.332
Granamyr, please,
you've got to help us.

12:13.818 --> 12:15.813
And who is this little girl,

12:15.838 --> 12:18.516
who presumes to speak
without my permission?

12:18.541 --> 12:20.626
I am Teela, Captain of the Royal Guard,

12:20.651 --> 12:22.232
and I will speak as I please.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.122
We shall see how your tongue wags when

12:25.147 --> 12:27.948
my magic sends you to the realm of demons.

12:28.673 --> 12:30.361
We don't want to fight you, but

12:30.386 --> 12:32.504
we will, if that's what it
takes to make you listen.

12:32.887 --> 12:34.498
Granamyr does not fight

12:34.523 --> 12:36.133
humans, Granamyr wins.

12:37.628 --> 12:39.176
He-Man! I...

12:39.201 --> 12:42.273
I can't break loose...

12:42.298 --> 12:43.312
Enough!

12:44.714 --> 12:47.361
You have courage, something

12:47.386 --> 12:49.729
I have seen in very few of your race.

12:50.571 --> 12:52.897
I will listen to
what you have to say.

12:52.922 --> 12:54.209
My friend Man-At-Arms

12:54.234 --> 12:57.020
has been turned into a
crystal statue by evil magic.

12:57.641 --> 12:59.692
I'm told you might know
how to undo this spell.

13:00.061 --> 13:01.080
Might?

13:01.105 --> 13:02.936
Am I not the wisest

13:02.960 --> 13:05.329
creature on all Eternia?
Do I not know

13:05.354 --> 13:07.564
magics that were forgotten before

13:07.589 --> 13:10.066
human kind ever walked this world?

13:10.352 --> 13:11.711
Then you can reverse the magic?

13:11.736 --> 13:13.226
Of course I can.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.088
It's poor magic at

13:15.113 --> 13:17.747
best, but I see no reason to

13:17.772 --> 13:19.859
trouble myself over a single human.

13:20.121 --> 13:22.016
It has been a thousand years,

13:22.041 --> 13:24.196
since I last spoke with humans.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.294
I found them... vain,

13:26.319 --> 13:28.372
greedy,

13:28.397 --> 13:30.457
warlike, untruthful...

13:30.482 --> 13:31.955
and quite ugly.

13:31.981 --> 13:33.767
They barged into my home,

13:33.792 --> 13:35.013
they begged for my help.

13:35.039 --> 13:36.712
And when I gave it,

13:36.737 --> 13:39.202
they never appreciated it.

13:39.604 --> 13:42.872
No thanks, not even a gift.

13:42.897 --> 13:44.623
You seem no different.

13:44.648 --> 13:46.679
If a gift would help convince you.

13:47.387 --> 13:48.387
Name it.

13:49.770 --> 13:51.728
There is something...

13:51.753 --> 13:52.754
Anything!

13:52.779 --> 13:55.460
In the center of the forgotten forest,

13:55.485 --> 13:57.299
stands Skytree.

13:57.324 --> 13:59.633
The oldest tree on Eternia.

13:59.647 --> 14:01.868
and the only thing in all the world,

14:01.893 --> 14:03.249
older than me.

14:03.274 --> 14:04.701
Chop it down,

14:04.726 --> 14:07.033
and bring it to me as a gift so I can

14:07.058 --> 14:09.121
watch it burn in my fireplace.

14:09.782 --> 14:10.865
Agreed?

14:10.890 --> 14:12.913
You'll save Man-At-Arms?

14:12.938 --> 14:15.473
I shall, consider it.

14:15.498 --> 14:16.584
Agreed!

14:17.831 --> 14:20.946
When you wish to return here,
speak my name.

14:20.971 --> 14:22.034
And remember,

14:22.059 --> 14:24.046
you have given your word to a dragon,

14:24.722 --> 14:27.313
Fail to bring me my gift and I will send

14:27.338 --> 14:29.677
you to the realm of demons...

14:29.702 --> 14:30.702
Forever!

14:39.128 --> 14:40.961
The Forgotten Forest!

14:40.986 --> 14:42.266
Why, it's beautiful!

14:42.291 --> 14:43.822
But where's Skytree?

14:44.210 --> 14:46.697
And why would you be looking for Skytree?

14:50.401 --> 14:52.752
Show yourself,
we won't harm you.

14:52.777 --> 14:54.191
Show myself I will,

14:54.216 --> 14:56.000
but as for harming me.

14:56.778 --> 14:57.805
Well...

14:58.830 --> 15:00.960
let's just say it's a bad idea.

15:03.501 --> 15:05.833
Keep hold o' that big pussycat laddie.

15:05.858 --> 15:07.985
You don't want trouble now, do you?

15:08.010 --> 15:09.912
Take it easy Battle Cat.

15:09.937 --> 15:11.734
Who and what are you?

15:11.759 --> 15:15.978
Oh well, good sir and lovely lady.

15:16.003 --> 15:18.030
My name is Tullamore

15:18.056 --> 15:19.739
and I'm a Treeprechaun.

15:19.990 --> 15:21.444
A Treeprechaun?

15:21.469 --> 15:22.802
Ah, the same.

15:22.827 --> 15:24.185
We Treeprechauns are the

15:24.210 --> 15:26.205
keepers of the forgotten forest.

15:26.230 --> 15:28.497
Then please tell us where to find Skytree.

15:28.892 --> 15:30.835
Why that's no problem at all,

15:30.860 --> 15:32.620
just lift your eyes.

15:38.579 --> 15:40.483
Thank you, now let's go!

15:44.051 --> 15:46.442
Just a minute now,
you haven't told me, what you be

15:46.467 --> 15:47.467
be after doing?

15:47.470 --> 15:49.087
I don't think you want to know.

15:49.795 --> 15:50.795
Move!

15:52.480 --> 15:54.158
You miserable creatures,

15:54.183 --> 15:55.551
you won't get away.

15:59.466 --> 16:00.599
After him, boyos!

16:15.169 --> 16:17.246
Skytree!
Hurry, He-Man!

16:20.049 --> 16:21.774
Stop, you monsters!

16:27.353 --> 16:30.410
You'll pay for that!
Mccree, Mccrack

16:30.435 --> 16:33.491
Mccarn, Mccroo
He-Man, the trees!

16:36.820 --> 16:42.167
Halt! What is going on here?

16:43.592 --> 16:46.615
Forgive me for disturbing your
rest, Your Treeness.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.371
But these folks are after
doing you some harm.

16:49.961 --> 16:51.575
Is this true?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.137
I'm afraid it is.

16:53.162 --> 16:55.098
But why?

16:55.974 --> 16:57.285
Please try to understand.

16:57.310 --> 16:58.754
We don't want to hurt you,

16:58.779 --> 17:01.217
but my father's life is at stake.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.824
If we don't bring you to Granamyr

17:02.849 --> 17:03.981
as a gift, he won't tell us

17:04.006 --> 17:05.256
how to reverse the spell that's

17:05.281 --> 17:06.529
turned my father to crystal.

17:06.873 --> 17:09.258
Granamyr? Is that

17:09.282 --> 17:13.051
old dragon still jealous of me?

17:13.428 --> 17:15.424
Yes, and unless I bring you down for

17:15.449 --> 17:17.500
his fire pit, Man-At-Arms is doomed.

17:17.963 --> 17:20.486
Man-At-Arms?

17:20.511 --> 17:22.415
He's your father?

17:22.440 --> 17:24.073
Yes. You know of him?

17:24.479 --> 17:26.339
I know the name.

17:26.464 --> 17:29.139
Through all of Eternia's long history,

17:29.464 --> 17:31.494
there has been a Man-At-Arms

17:31.519 --> 17:33.040
to uphold the cause

17:33.241 --> 17:34.241
of goodness.

17:34.265 --> 17:37.169
In a time now forgotten one such

17:37.194 --> 17:39.506
Man-At-Arms saved this forest

17:39.531 --> 17:41.776
from the Witches of fire.

17:42.215 --> 17:44.354
I am still in his debt.

17:44.379 --> 17:45.445
Then you'll help us?

17:47.896 --> 17:50.187
I have stood in this spot for

17:50.212 --> 17:51.810
countless ages.

17:51.835 --> 17:53.835
From my seeds the

17:53.860 --> 17:55.642
forests were born.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.028
I am the soul

17:57.053 --> 17:59.821
of all that is green and good.

18:00.384 --> 18:01.832
Though I may fall,

18:01.857 --> 18:03.515
I will always exist

18:03.540 --> 18:06.565
wherever a tree spreads it's branches

18:06.590 --> 18:08.092
to the sky.

18:08.117 --> 18:09.501
Take up your sword,

18:09.526 --> 18:10.806
man of Eternia,

18:10.831 --> 18:13.211
and save your friend.

18:13.324 --> 18:15.590
Oh thank you. Thank you!

18:15.615 --> 18:17.298
But you can't go, you can't.

18:17.302 --> 18:19.338
It won't be the same without ya.

18:19.924 --> 18:23.028
Then it will be... different.

18:23.153 --> 18:25.678
Keep the leaves of my children

18:25.703 --> 18:27.890
green, old friend Tullamore.

18:34.871 --> 18:37.296
Teela, we can't do this.

18:37.321 --> 18:38.412
But my father?

18:38.437 --> 18:39.437
If he were here,

18:39.517 --> 18:42.181
I know he'd feel the same way.
You agree?

18:44.999 --> 18:46.666
Hoop-shalla! Hoop-shalla!

18:49.158 --> 18:51.320
I thank you and

18:51.345 --> 18:53.073
I am sorry.

18:53.441 --> 18:54.441
Ready?

18:57.061 --> 18:58.061
Granamyr.

19:03.138 --> 19:05.586
Where is my gift?
We don't have it.

19:05.611 --> 19:06.698
But you agreed.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.240
Skytree...

19:08.284 --> 19:10.217
in fact any tree, has as much

19:10.243 --> 19:11.553
right to life as you,

19:11.578 --> 19:13.011
or me or Man-At-Arms.

19:13.469 --> 19:14.852
We will not take a life,

19:14.877 --> 19:16.543
to save a life.

19:16.568 --> 19:18.292
Pick another gift or...

19:18.317 --> 19:21.014
or send us to the realm of demons.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.093
...now.

19:22.439 --> 19:24.056
It would be my right to do

19:24.081 --> 19:26.005
so, wouldn't it?
It would.

19:26.031 --> 19:28.765
Wisdom, compassion,

19:28.790 --> 19:30.978
and the honoring of a bargain.

19:31.533 --> 19:33.507
Who would have thought humankind would

19:33.532 --> 19:36.005
have improved so
much in a 1000 years?

19:37.305 --> 19:40.151
I accept this gift, He-Man.

19:42.251 --> 19:44.579
In this book, is the knowledge

19:44.604 --> 19:46.388
you need to restore your friend.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.181
Thank you Granamyr.
Thank you.

19:51.506 --> 19:53.290
You can thank me best by,

19:53.316 --> 19:55.365
letting me... sleep,

19:55.390 --> 19:58.566
and never bothering me again.

20:03.181 --> 20:04.542
So, He-Man made

20:04.567 --> 20:06.035
the right choice after all.

20:06.059 --> 20:07.505
He said you would have

20:07.530 --> 20:09.118
done exactly the same father.

20:09.496 --> 20:11.244
Dragons seem to have a very strange

20:11.269 --> 20:12.654
way of doing things.

20:12.679 --> 20:13.970
That's the truth.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.828
You know I'd like to
meet that Granamyr.

20:15.853 --> 20:17.015
What do you say, Cringer?

20:17.472 --> 20:18.841
Should we go hunting a dragon?

20:20.266 --> 20:22.024
Oh n-no, not me.

20:22.749 --> 20:25.368
It looks like Cringer's
made a good choice too.

20:33.397 --> 20:35.461
Today He-Man had
to decide whether

20:35.486 --> 20:36.932
or not to chop down a tree.

20:36.957 --> 20:38.815
Now, the trees around you probably

20:38.840 --> 20:40.203
don't speak the way Skytree did.

20:41.249 --> 20:42.757
Or if they do, we haven't learned to

20:42.782 --> 20:44.287
hear them... yet.

20:44.813 --> 20:46.539
But trees are living things.

20:46.564 --> 20:48.205
And when you respect a tree,

20:48.766 --> 20:50.747
you show that you
care about all life.

20:50.772 --> 20:52.172
Life is a wonderful,

20:52.200 --> 20:53.200
precious gift.

20:53.270 --> 20:55.261
Learn to enjoy and respect it

20:55.342 --> 20:56.440
and you'll be a happier,

20:56.465 --> 20:57.517
better person for it.

20:57.612 --> 20:58.612
Bye for now.
