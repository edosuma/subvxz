WEBVTT

00:18.853 --> 00:20.969
-You know we would find you.
-I didn't run.

00:21.147 --> 00:22.978
-Yes.
-I could have gone to the police.

00:23.149 --> 00:25.231
We'd have gone to see
your beautiful family.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.517
Please, there must be another way.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.478
I wasn't sent to negotiate.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.491
-Please!
-Are you crazy?

00:43.669 --> 00:45.000
I almost killed you, man.

00:45.171 --> 00:47.378
-Help me, please!
-Calm down, man. Calm down.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.290
There's a man. He's over there.

00:54.430 --> 00:55.465
He's out.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.140
-Pulse, blood pressure steady.
-He's waking up.

01:00.311 --> 01:01.972
-Let's get him into surgery.
-Please.

01:02.605 --> 01:05.847
A drop site at southeast.
Fielding is standing by for the corpse.

01:06.025 --> 01:07.105
How long will you need?

01:07.276 --> 01:10.643
Tell him no more than 40 minutes.
Doctor's scrubbing in.

01:11.614 --> 01:15.106
I need .05 of lorazepam.
Let's get a 12â€”lead EKG.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.616
-No! Don't!
-CBC, BMP.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.990
Sorry, Mr. Wyatt. You are out of time.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.086
Okay. Everybody up.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.671
-lt's 5 am.
-Get up.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.255
Sir, don't forget your shoes.

01:36.973 --> 01:39.089
-Hey, you.
-Let's go!

01:39.642 --> 01:41.348
What happened to your clothes?

01:41.936 --> 01:43.722
Yeah, let's go.

01:46.983 --> 01:49.019
Oh, my God.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.998
Looking for this?

02:18.889 --> 02:20.629
-|'|| scream.
-Don't. Listen to me.

02:20.808 --> 02:24.050
Reddington knows where I am.
He found me, and he is coming here.

02:24.228 --> 02:27.971
But you need to know
that you can't trust him.

02:28.149 --> 02:32.233
He is using you.
And when Berlin is dead, he will kill you.

02:32.403 --> 02:35.770
If you're trying to help me,
why don't you put the gun down?

02:41.037 --> 02:42.902
Has he told you?

02:44.373 --> 02:47.206
Has he told you anything
about that night, about the fire?

02:48.669 --> 02:53.584
You need to ask him, Liz, for the truth
about why he turned himself in to the FBI.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.339
-No.
-lt's not what you think.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.179
You should have killed him.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.178
-Ask him.
-You should have finished it.

03:01.349 --> 03:04.261
Make him answer.
You deserve to know the truth.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.767
Your father, Naomi Hyland....

03:06.937 --> 03:10.100
Red doesn't want you to know
that that night, the night of the fire--

03:16.238 --> 03:18.229
What do you want, Agent Keen?

03:29.627 --> 03:31.163
What do you really want?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.449
Hey, hey, hey.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.861
-You're following me.
-l'm staying at the Millbrook.

04:07.039 --> 04:10.156
-l was just going to the gym.
-Open up your bag.

04:12.086 --> 04:15.544
-Open up your bag. Open it up!
-What the hell are you doing?

04:17.383 --> 04:19.044
Who are you?

04:22.388 --> 04:23.423
I'm sorry.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.811
The Indonesian government
has finally agreed...

04:32.982 --> 04:37.351
...to turn over all day-to-day operations
at the port to a private company.

04:37.528 --> 04:40.565
I'd like that company
to be operated by the Syndicate.

04:40.739 --> 04:41.819
That's unlikely.

04:41.991 --> 04:44.323
Our logistics company in the region
is too small.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.778
I agree.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.160
So I've taken steps to change that.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.195
I'm tripling our investment.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.740
What if we don't get the contract?

04:53.461 --> 04:55.452
You're fighting a war with Berlin...

04:55.629 --> 04:58.416
...that drags all of us
into the trenches with you.

04:58.591 --> 05:01.378
This is a time for caution, not risk.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.381
The fruit is ripe.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.307
Niko, I've made my decision.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.591
The men behind you
will take you to your car.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.357
Where's Naomi Hyland?

05:18.527 --> 05:20.028
You know, it's hard to say.

05:20.196 --> 05:22.778
I've never been great at reading
that woman's emotions.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.154
I need to talk to her.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.485
You want to talk to her.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.741
Perhaps some lingering
personal questions...

05:27.912 --> 05:30.528
-...you think my ex-wife can answer?
-You're hiding her.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.953
-What do you know about Paul Wyatt?
-Same as everyone else, I guess.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.992
He ran an investment firm...

05:37.171 --> 05:40.129
...but was being investigated
by the SEC for fraud.

05:40.299 --> 05:42.415
He was stealing life savings
and pensions.

05:42.593 --> 05:45.050
Only to turn up
with his heart ripped from his chest.

05:45.221 --> 05:49.055
Probably one of his clients. Police say
whoever did it was trying to make a point.

05:49.225 --> 05:53.810
Oh, well, as much as I admire the police
for their wonderful sense of irony...

05:53.979 --> 05:56.095
...I'm afraid they've got this one wrong.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.106
The man who killed Paul Wyatt
wasn't trying to make a point.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.607
He was trying to make a sale.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.985
His name is Dr. James Covington.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.657
Years ago, he was considered...

06:05.824 --> 06:08.782
...one of the top cardiothoracic surgeons
in the country.

06:08.953 --> 06:13.071
Now he runs
an illegal organ-transplant ring.

06:13.249 --> 06:15.535
His operation,
if you'll indulge the term...

06:15.709 --> 06:20.544
...is one-stop shopping for anyone who
needs a life-saving organ transplant...

06:20.714 --> 06:24.457
...but who can't or doesn't want
to go through conventional channels.

06:24.635 --> 06:28.423
My name is Oliver Fleck.
I represent Dr. James Covington.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.178
That includes criminals...

06:30.349 --> 06:33.386
...and wealthy clients
who don't happen to be first in line...

06:33.561 --> 06:34.846
...on the recipient list.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.137
-So where do the organs come from?
-Oh, that's not your concern.

06:38.315 --> 06:41.523
What matters is that we do
our very best to ensure their quality.

06:41.694 --> 06:43.855
If there are complications
in the first 10 years...

06:44.029 --> 06:46.111
...we make every effort to rectify them.

06:46.282 --> 06:48.193
He's harvesting organs.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.779
Killing innocent people
to sell off their parts?

06:50.953 --> 06:54.571
Lizzy, some of the worst of the worst
are still alive...

06:54.748 --> 06:56.613
...because Dr. Covington
is saving them.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.783
And you know how to find him?

06:58.961 --> 07:00.701
No. Slushie?

07:01.672 --> 07:03.082
-Pass.
-Oh, my gosh.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.168
You have no idea what you're missing.

07:05.342 --> 07:08.880
Try a grapefruit gusher.
It's just like you today, a little sour.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.382
Two grapefruit.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.797
Mr. Reddington was right.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.806
Covington was once
a respected surgeon.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.262
Got his MD at Yale...

07:16.437 --> 07:19.053
...fellowship in cardiothoracic surgery
at Vanderbilt.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.722
-So, what went wrong?
-He had some kind of meltdown.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.858
According to this,
he falsified a document...

07:25.029 --> 07:27.441
...and stole a set of lungs
from the donor pool.

07:27.615 --> 07:30.823
Did some kind of experimental operation
on a 10-year-old child.

07:30.993 --> 07:34.702
A few weeks later, the guy who was
supposed to receive the transplant died.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.329
The DA considered charging Covington,
but he was off the grid.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.662
Want to introduce you
to Samar Navabi.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.247
You're tall.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.583
Agent Ressler. Keen.

07:45.758 --> 07:49.046
-You two have already met.
-In Warsaw. Glad to see you made it out.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.837
Agent Navabi is on loan
to our task force indefinitely.

07:53.432 --> 07:56.595
-You found Reddington.
-Are those real-time NSA feeds?

07:56.769 --> 07:59.476
I hunted the guy for five years.
How long did it take you?

07:59.647 --> 08:02.434
Well, it was 74 days.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.268
We were lucky.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.434
They would kill to see these in Tehran.

08:06.612 --> 08:09.069
How does an Iranian end up
working for Mossad?

08:09.239 --> 08:11.070
How did the FBI end up
working for Reddington?

08:11.241 --> 08:14.449
How'd you find us in Warsaw?
Who told you we were there?

08:14.620 --> 08:17.657
Medical examinerjust called.
He needs to see you.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.537
Stat.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.538
-How do we know we can trust her?
-We don't.

08:27.716 --> 08:31.629
But she did save our lives.
Buys her some goodwill, don't you think?

08:31.804 --> 08:34.216
You know Reddington sent her
to Warsaw.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.255
There has to be something
going on there.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.641
Sounds like someone's a little jealous
Uncle Red's got a new crush.

08:41.271 --> 08:42.772
Dr. Ryerson, what'd you find?

08:42.940 --> 08:48.355
Well, Ijust completed my autopsy
on Mr. Wyatt here.

08:48.529 --> 08:52.989
I was told that your theory
was that the heart was harvested.

08:53.158 --> 08:57.401
-It is.
-Yeah, well, buy a hat and hang onto it...

08:57.579 --> 09:00.116
...because that theory
may have a little wrinkle.

09:00.666 --> 09:05.581
The incision in his chest
was made over a prior midline incision.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.541
Tox screen was positive
for immunosuppressive drugs...

09:08.716 --> 09:11.549
...and I am seeing scarring of the aorta.

09:11.719 --> 09:12.959
All of which means what?

09:14.096 --> 09:17.259
Well, there's residual foreign tissue...

09:17.433 --> 09:19.640
...Ieft behind
from when the heart was removed.

09:21.812 --> 09:25.100
This guy had
a previous heart transplant.

09:25.274 --> 09:28.687
The heart that was taken
from his chest wasn't his to begin with.

09:28.861 --> 09:31.944
Look, I wish I could help,
but my life...

09:33.323 --> 09:35.530
...it's in disarray.

09:35.701 --> 09:38.067
We file for bankruptcy, and now this?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.361
We really need you
to look at the reports.

09:40.539 --> 09:44.327
We've been over your husband's medical
files. No reference to a heart transplant.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.583
-I don't know what to say.
-We checked.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.837
There's no record of your husband
ever receiving a donor organ.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.915
They'll kill me if I talk.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.881
Unless you talk,
there's nothing we can do to protect you.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.133
Dr. James Covington.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.265
Your husband was one of his clients?

10:06.440 --> 10:08.476
Paul suffered
from congestive heart failure.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.936
He needed a transplant.

10:11.570 --> 10:14.812
He could've waited, put his name
on the donor list like everyone else.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.400
But not Paul.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.817
We had the money, so he found a way
to get the transplant immediately.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.656
He bought a heart from Covington.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.995
Yes and no.

10:25.083 --> 10:30.578
The organs that Dr. Covington provides,
they're not available for purchase.

10:30.964 --> 10:31.999
You rent them...

10:32.466 --> 10:35.708
...$500,000 for every year
you use the product.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.548
When Paul's business was thriving,
that wasn't a problem.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.304
After the SEC investigation,
we couldn't afford to pay.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.512
And if you can't pay,
you have to return the product.

10:44.686 --> 10:48.850
-Excuse me?
-My husband's heart wasn't harvested.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.015
It was repossessed.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.784
He won't convince them
to put us in charge of the port.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.568
I don't care what Reddington says.
It's reckless.

11:02.746 --> 11:03.826
Agreed.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.581
The directorate general may be an ally,
but we know who makes the decision.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.242
Garong Sundri,
the Deputy Minister of Transportation.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.500
He's against us.

11:11.672 --> 11:15.585
And Reddington's investing a fortune
in new equipment to change his mind.

11:15.759 --> 11:19.468
-This could bankrupt us.
-It's a desperate move.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.674
-Gentlemen.
-I'm afraid you've made a mistake, friend.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.311
-Do you know where you are?
-Yes, Niko, I know exactly where I am.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.223
And I know who you work with.
And unfortunately for you...

11:32.401 --> 11:36.189
...I work with the one man in the world
who doesn't care.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.728
You work for Berlin?

11:38.282 --> 11:39.317
What do you want?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.865
Berlin sent me with an offer.

11:43.245 --> 11:44.360
If I were you...

11:45.831 --> 11:51.042
...I would think of it
as a once-in-a-Iifetime opportunity.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.126
Repossessed for nonpayment.
Like a house or a car.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.291
Exactly. He killed Paul Wyatt...

11:58.468 --> 12:02.006
...because he didn't get his 500 grand
in the annual rental fee.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.343
How's that work? Once a heart's
been transplanted, can it be reused?

12:05.517 --> 12:08.975
Covington didn't kill him to reuse
the heart. He did it to send a message.

12:09.146 --> 12:12.013
Where I come from,
fear is the only deterrent.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.105
I'm from Delaware.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.900
No, I'm just saying.
I'm actually half-Jewish.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.322
Well, a quarter, really.
Half-Muslim too, so....

12:19.489 --> 12:20.899
But....

12:21.825 --> 12:22.905
Who's counting?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.067
Been tracking the info from Mrs. Wyatt.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.281
According to her,
they paid the rental fee...

12:27.456 --> 12:30.368
...by making donations
to a charity called the Wellbright Fund.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.828
It's a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.039
Pull a tax return,
list of company expenses?

12:35.213 --> 12:39.456
Yeah, and get this, the fund paid
over 200 grand to a Dr. Gordon Albee...

12:39.635 --> 12:42.593
-...for consulting services.
-Consulting on what?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.840
-Dr. Albee.
-FB|.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.349
Sorry. No crime to fight.

12:49.519 --> 12:53.137
-Poor Norman committed suicide.
-You're the medical examiner?

12:53.315 --> 12:55.431
The board has you listed
as a general surgeon.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.850
Yeah, well, I wear several hats.

12:58.028 --> 13:01.646
One of those involve consulting
for a charity called The Wellbright Fund?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.903
What exactly do you do for the fund?

13:07.329 --> 13:11.948
Listen, I'd be happy to help,
but I have an autopsy waiting.

13:12.125 --> 13:16.334
-You know, if you'd call my office--
-They paid you over $200,000 last year.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.750
Call my office.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.252
We've got nothing to charge him with,
and until we do...

13:25.430 --> 13:28.422
...he's never gonna tell us
what we need to know.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.465
"Mr. Vargas."

13:30.644 --> 13:33.636
Sounds like some shady character
in a Humphrey Bogart film.

13:33.814 --> 13:37.022
-I like him already.
-He said he worked for Berlin.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.693
And his offer?

13:38.860 --> 13:41.146
He said Berlin's opening up
a short window.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.654
If we break with you,
he'll let us operate under his name.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.783
And you think some of the others
were receptive.

13:47.953 --> 13:50.319
The others are supporting you
at great risk.

13:50.497 --> 13:54.536
If the port deal goes south,
it could bankrupt us.

13:54.710 --> 13:58.043
It's a very fragile proposition.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.750
Thank you, Niko.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.757
I appreciate you coming to me
with your opinion.

14:03.927 --> 14:07.260
But I'm feeling bullish.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.266
Keep an eye on the others.

14:10.434 --> 14:14.518
If someone intends to defect,
I wanna be standing right in front of them.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.024
Hello?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.571
I need to talk to him.

14:23.739 --> 14:26.151
I'd like to borrow Mr. Kaplan.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.330
Oh, my God. He wouldn't stop talking.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.661
But I was able to buy us another hour.

14:37.836 --> 14:41.169
We need to wrap this up quickly, though.
He has bowling league at 6.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.375
-Maybe this was a mistake.
-It's not.

14:43.550 --> 14:47.668
You said yourself it would take weeks
to secure the necessary court orders...

14:47.846 --> 14:50.212
...and how many more victims
will there be by then?

14:50.390 --> 14:53.257
It's the same as the other three,
heart and lungs are missing.

14:53.435 --> 14:56.723
This one still has a liver,
but I see signs of cirrhosis.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.853
Probably wasn't healthy enough
to be sold.

14:59.024 --> 15:03.267
Remember the time we made barley stew
with that coroner from Des Moines?

15:03.445 --> 15:05.527
It was Reuben soup.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.938
How can I forget?
I was sleeping with his sister.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.323
That's right.

15:10.494 --> 15:14.112
Your Dr. Albee's in a lot of trouble,
sweetie. This should be all you need.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.411
Four bodies, Dr. Albee.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.706
You performed an autopsy
on all four in the last year.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.091
None of the four
were registered organ donors...

15:28.261 --> 15:31.378
...but all four were missing vital organs.
How do you explain that?

15:31.556 --> 15:33.467
Fine. I'll answer for you.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.974
You're a supplier
for Dr. James Covington.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.385
You provide vital organs
for him to sell...

15:38.563 --> 15:41.521
...and he pays you
through the Wellbright Fund.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.148
I don't know Covington.

15:44.319 --> 15:48.028
I was approached by an associate
about providing him with viable material.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.278
You deal with bodies.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.781
-I thought donor organs had to be fresh.
-They do.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.159
It only works
in very specific circumstances...

15:54.329 --> 15:56.320
...once I get control of the body as ME.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.830
-How much time do you have?
-Depends on the organ.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.161
Anywhere between 30 to 90 minutes.

16:01.336 --> 16:02.917
You transport them. How?

16:03.088 --> 16:06.501
I call a number.
They send a courier to pick it up.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.416
Look, I'll cooperate.
I'll do whatever you need.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.255
But you have to protect me.

16:12.013 --> 16:15.597
Fine. But first, you need
to make a phone call.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.184
What are the odds Covington's courier
will inspect the organ?

16:27.362 --> 16:31.071
He's gonna have to make sure the size
and weight are a match for their patient.

16:31.241 --> 16:35.029
You don't think he's gonna notice he's
staring at the heart of a 300-pound hog?

16:35.203 --> 16:37.785
Human and porcine hearts
are nearly identical.

16:37.956 --> 16:41.073
Unless he's got expertise,
he won't be able to tell the difference.

16:41.251 --> 16:44.835
Aram just finished the mock-up
for the medical file on our fictitious donor.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.541
Old porko's got a name.

16:46.715 --> 16:50.173
Gustavo Mosquera, 35,
no history of heart disease.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.210
-Killed in a hit-and-run. Time of death--
-Thirty minutes ago.

16:53.388 --> 16:56.926
Aram even generated a social and W-2
in case they run a background check.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.636
What's our ETA for delivery?

16:58.810 --> 17:00.141
Within the hour.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.229
My men captured this two hours ago.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.107
Titillating.

17:07.277 --> 17:11.361
But what Laskin and Russo do with
or to one another in their spare time...

17:11.531 --> 17:13.192
...is none of my concern.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.153
Right. Except a minute later....

17:18.038 --> 17:20.450
A threesome? Interesting.

17:20.624 --> 17:25.209
Based on his sartorial splendor,
I gather this is Mr. Vargas.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.041
Does that even look like real hair?

17:29.216 --> 17:32.174
We have to assume
they accepted his offer...

17:32.344 --> 17:34.835
...and cut the deal with Berlin.

17:35.931 --> 17:39.890
Why assume, Niko,
when I can ask them myself?

17:48.443 --> 17:51.810
Ijust sent you an image of a man
who matches our suspect's description.

17:51.988 --> 17:55.355
Got it. I am processing him
through the database now.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.453
-How much time do we have?
-Two hours' viability max. Here's his file.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.413
Ronald Cassell.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.245
Check fraud, theft, battery.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.705
But he does have
some medical training.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.121
Former Army combat medic
out of Fort Drum.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.415
Everything checks out.
A match for our client.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.970
Excellent. I'll see you in 20 minutes.

18:21.643 --> 18:22.678
Good news, Mr. Babbitt.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.511
We're ready to begin.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.893
Heads up, everybody.
Target's on the move.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.775
Ressler, heâ€™s headed
towards the front door.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.290
Of course it's a motorcycle.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.522
He made me.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.399
I'm gonna head him off. Hang on.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.277
Doctor, we have a problem.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.171
Go, go, go.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.559
Go, go, go.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.354
Jesus.

20:22.138 --> 20:25.096
Gentlemen, thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.348
I know you two
have had a very busy day.

20:27.519 --> 20:28.804
Nothing out of the ordinary.

20:29.187 --> 20:33.226
I hear you boys engaged
in a little tryst downtown this morning.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.936
We had a meeting at the Corgate.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.396
-This an interrogation?
-Yes.

20:37.904 --> 20:41.488
I understand an offer was made
by Berlin's representative.

20:41.658 --> 20:42.738
Red, look--

20:42.909 --> 20:45.821
What I don't understand
is why only one of my associates...

20:45.995 --> 20:48.122
...thought to bring that to my attention.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.490
We didn't tell
because there's nothing to tell.

20:52.669 --> 20:57.754
J.P., I'm delighted you were able
to hold dear Teddy's hand...

20:57.924 --> 21:00.836
...and help him overcome
all his anxieties about me...

21:01.010 --> 21:02.386
...bankrupting our operation.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.796
I'd be lying if I told you
I wasn't concerned about this deal.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.841
If I were you, Teddy,
I'd be more concerned about the plans...

21:09.018 --> 21:11.350
...these gentlemen have
for your immediate future.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.228
What? What--?
What are you doing? Wait a minute.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.894
-Stop! Red, Red!
-What's going on?

21:17.402 --> 21:18.938
-Come on!
-What the hell?

21:19.112 --> 21:22.024
-Don't do this. Don't--
-Let me go!

21:28.496 --> 21:30.987
We just lost our only lead
to Covington.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.580
Maybe there's another way.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.375
I just found this on Cassell.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.918
-Medical file of Covington's next client.
-The one who's getting the pig's heart?

21:41.092 --> 21:44.084
-Who is it?
-His name's Bernard Babbitt.

21:44.721 --> 21:47.258
Bernard Babbitt, known as B.B.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.548
Runs the Desobry syndicate
out of New Orleans.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.682
Moving drugs and weapons
through Fourchon.

21:51.853 --> 21:55.812
Bureau's been trying to indict him on
racketeering, murder charges for years.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.062
So you know him?

21:57.233 --> 22:00.191
Know him? Oh, my gosh.

22:00.361 --> 22:04.195
I once shared a ride with the man
on a twin-engine prop...

22:04.365 --> 22:06.105
...from Port-au-Prince to Baracoa.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.990
We had to countenNeight the plane...

22:08.161 --> 22:12.575
...with three containers of Russian RPGs
just to accommodate his girth.

22:12.749 --> 22:15.365
I thought he'd be more cautious
about where to hang out.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.625
Well, B.B.'s an indulgent man.

22:17.795 --> 22:22.038
He loves to be surrounded
with what he loves the most.

22:24.135 --> 22:27.719
B.B. Just like a bear at a campsite.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.220
You poor thing.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.468
Honestly, I don't know how you do it.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.058
It boggles the imagination.

22:34.854 --> 22:35.934
Red.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.845
I suppose it isn't any wonder...

22:38.024 --> 22:41.983
...you can justify cramming all this
grease-drenched gristle into your face...

22:42.153 --> 22:45.987
...given that you've already paid
to replace that rotted nub you call a heart.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.864
How's that going, by the way?
I heard you had a setback...

22:49.035 --> 22:52.152
...a problem with the donor
not coming through?

22:52.330 --> 22:53.820
Give us a moment, mouche a miel.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.712
What do you want, Reddington?

23:04.050 --> 23:07.338
The good Dr. Covington.
He and I need to have a conversation.

23:07.512 --> 23:11.346
And since you happen to be in touch,
I thought you could connect us.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.678
B.B.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.184
Surely you have some way
to get ahold of the man.

23:17.355 --> 23:18.936
You're in his care.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.517
I have a number.

23:20.692 --> 23:22.648
But strictly for emergencies.

23:22.819 --> 23:26.437
So I sure as hell ain't giving it to you.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.105
Last thing I need to do
is piss this guy off...

23:29.284 --> 23:30.820
...before he cuts my chest open.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.279
Talk to me after my surgery.

23:38.376 --> 23:40.662
B.B., you don't look well.
Are you all right?

23:42.255 --> 23:44.462
Let me guess, irregular heartbeat...

23:44.632 --> 23:46.338
...shortness of breath.

23:46.509 --> 23:49.046
Perhaps a little tingling
in your nether regions?

23:49.429 --> 23:50.760
What the hell are you doing?

23:50.930 --> 23:52.966
Those drinks you've been enjoying?

23:53.141 --> 23:55.382
They weren't from the house.
They were from me.

23:55.560 --> 23:59.769
I hope you don't mind. I took the liberty
of adding a special surprise ingredient.

23:59.939 --> 24:03.898
Something to treat any localized
dysfunction you may be suffering.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.480
Has the little man been falling down
on the job?

24:06.654 --> 24:07.894
It's a miracle drug.

24:08.072 --> 24:10.779
Not so much for a glutton
with a bum heart, however.

24:10.950 --> 24:14.442
But look on the bright side,
you'll die with a marvelous erection.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.077
I can't breathe.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.705
Well, the two gentlemen behind me
happen to be paramedics.

24:19.876 --> 24:24.165
Put me in touch with Covington,
they'll be happy to assist you.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.420
What do you think, B.B.?

24:27.216 --> 24:30.299
Does this feel like an emergency?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.177
You wanted to see me?

24:33.348 --> 24:34.428
Close the door.

24:37.268 --> 24:40.556
I got the psych evals back
from Dr. Friedman.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.220
She has some concerns.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.775
Ressler. She wanted to suspend him
because he was--

24:44.942 --> 24:47.103
She has no problem with Ressler.

24:47.278 --> 24:50.190
-It's you she's concerned about.
-That's ridiculous. I'm fine.

24:50.365 --> 24:53.482
That's what she's concerned about.
And, frankly, I am too.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.366
You're concerned that I'm fine?

24:55.995 --> 24:59.408
That you didn't mourn
or take time off to grieve.

24:59.582 --> 25:01.914
Not for your marriage,
but for what Keen put you through.

25:02.085 --> 25:04.701
I will mourn when we get Berlin.

25:04.879 --> 25:07.165
Dr. Friedman recommended
a one-month paid leave.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.706
Fine. It'll give me more time
to hunt Berlin.

25:09.884 --> 25:12.421
I'm not taking
the doctor's recommendation.

25:12.595 --> 25:14.961
But I am concerned.
The investigation's ongoing...

25:15.139 --> 25:18.051
...you and I both know
there's a good chance Tom Keen is alive.

25:18.226 --> 25:21.718
What that's done to you,
how you've coped, the hotel rooms...

25:21.896 --> 25:25.730
...your paranoia is understandable, but
I'm worried it could become a problem.

25:25.900 --> 25:29.939
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I am
doing the best I can to handle this.

25:30.113 --> 25:31.649
Elizabeth...

25:32.865 --> 25:34.321
...I'm not criticizing you.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.535
If I were in your shoes....

25:40.248 --> 25:44.537
I only want you to know
that if you feel like you're under water...

25:44.711 --> 25:47.828
...if you need to talk, my door is open.

25:48.339 --> 25:49.749
Thank you.

25:53.344 --> 25:54.925
It's Reddington.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.590
Hey. Did you get a lead on Covington?

25:57.765 --> 26:00.598
-What are we looking at?
-We've got a number on Covington.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.100
-Aram's working a trace.
-A digital VolP line.

26:03.271 --> 26:07.184
Man, this thing is getting bounced
all over the globe to mask its origin.

26:08.776 --> 26:12.769
The line just went active.
Covington's making a call.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.901
What happened to Cassell?
He called in, said he....

26:16.075 --> 26:18.157
A few more seconds,
I'll have an address.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.075
I need you here.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.032
-We have a removal at 5.
-All right.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.787
Oh, no, no, no. Damn it.

26:23.958 --> 26:27.121
I was only able to narrow his location
down to this five-block area.

26:27.295 --> 26:30.583
-He's gonna repossess another organ.
-Well, we gotta move.

26:30.757 --> 26:34.545
If we don't find Covington in 43 minutes,
we're gonna find another body.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.962
Is that the 5-7
you've been raving about?

26:40.141 --> 26:41.881
Indeed. See for yourself.

26:42.059 --> 26:44.596
Polymer over steel,
ambidextrous controls.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.221
Be right with you.

26:48.399 --> 26:49.605
We've been through this.

26:49.776 --> 26:53.940
Berlin prefers firearms manufactured
in Russia or Eastern Europe.

26:55.573 --> 26:58.610
Just give me the same shipment
as last time.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.116
My apologies.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.498
I expected to have that all wrapped up
before you arrived.

27:07.668 --> 27:08.748
Where are we?

27:08.920 --> 27:11.502
-It's done.
-Reddington bought the photo op?

27:11.672 --> 27:15.540
I didn't even need to present
real evidence his men had betrayed him.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.959
He has become reckless, unstable.

27:18.429 --> 27:21.887
It seems our arrangement
is off to a promising start.

27:22.058 --> 27:27.724
Regarding that arrangement,
I think we need to revisit the terms.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.524
I betrayed Raymond Reddington.

27:30.691 --> 27:34.024
He's not gonna just absorb that blow
and move on.

27:34.195 --> 27:35.810
I need him taken care of.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.192
If Berlin wanted Reddington dead,
he'd have done that already.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.779
Yeah, well, things have changed.

27:41.953 --> 27:44.035
You're doing business with me now.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.742
I know everything
about Reddington's operation...

27:46.916 --> 27:50.408
...and I'm willing to hand over all of that
to your employer.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.373
But I need Reddington gone.

27:54.131 --> 27:58.795
I can't be an effective partner to Berlin
if I'm always looking over my shoulder.

28:00.096 --> 28:05.011
Set a meeting with Reddington.
My people will take care of the rest.

28:14.694 --> 28:17.436
-Landlord's still not answering.
-This has to be the place.

28:17.613 --> 28:20.821
We've been to every store,
office park and restaurant in the area.

28:20.992 --> 28:23.404
Got 20 minutes
till Covington kills his next victim.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.076
What are you doing?

28:30.751 --> 28:33.879
I like to keep a spare key in the trunk.

28:48.686 --> 28:49.801
Hey. Anything?

28:50.479 --> 28:52.640
A whole lot of nothing.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.366
Hey, Keen. Look at this.

29:09.540 --> 29:12.407
-We got a stain/vay to the lower level.
-Lower level?

29:12.585 --> 29:14.325
There's some kind of access stain/vay.

29:14.503 --> 29:18.746
The building plans filed with the city
don't say anything about a lower level.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.962
Hands. Hands.
Let me see your hands.

30:42.133 --> 30:44.124
You can't be in here.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.508
I got this.

30:47.638 --> 30:48.718
Wait, sir.

30:48.889 --> 30:50.049
-Don't go in there.
-Sit.

30:50.224 --> 30:51.430
Please. I'm begging you.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.635
I said sit.

30:57.565 --> 30:58.850
Back away from the table.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.228
-Don't know who you are--
-Hands in the air!

31:02.403 --> 31:04.769
Step away from the table now!

31:11.912 --> 31:15.496
-You don't know what you're doing.
-It's over. We know about your business.

31:15.666 --> 31:19.124
You lost your license for performing
an experimental operation on a child.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.785
Well, not this one. Not today.

31:20.963 --> 31:23.500
I'm not trying to hurt the boy.
I'm trying to save him.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.005
His name is Daniel.

31:25.176 --> 31:26.882
If he doesn't get these lungs soon...

31:27.053 --> 31:29.465
-...he won't survive.
-He needs to be in a hospital.

31:29.638 --> 31:33.301
It's too late for that.
I'm performing this operation.

31:33.476 --> 31:35.637
If you want to stop me,
you'll have to shoot me.

31:37.271 --> 31:39.387
Won't be a problem.

31:43.110 --> 31:46.853
There are strict rules controlling who
gets access to donor organs and when.

31:47.031 --> 31:48.441
In the present system...

31:48.616 --> 31:52.279
...they offer adult donor lungs
to adults...

31:52.453 --> 31:54.990
...even if there are children
with a more urgent need.

31:55.164 --> 31:57.826
-I'm not discussing this with you.
-I took adult lungs...

31:58.000 --> 32:00.036
...and transplanted them
into a little girl.

32:00.211 --> 32:02.702
That's why I lost my license,
for saving her life.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.960
So you know better?

32:04.131 --> 32:07.089
Okay, putting adult lungs into children
is a risk.

32:07.259 --> 32:11.423
But I believe, in many cases,
we have an obligation to try.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.134
And I'm not the only one.
Times are changing.

32:14.308 --> 32:17.300
There's even an official appeals process
for these cases now.

32:17.478 --> 32:20.185
Then his parents can request
an exception to the rule.

32:20.356 --> 32:21.766
And risk being turned down.

32:21.941 --> 32:24.933
At least here,
I guarantee him a chance.

32:25.111 --> 32:28.399
You killed Paul Wyatt.
You ripped the heart out of his chest.

32:28.572 --> 32:31.314
Look, you can think whatever you want
about me...

32:31.492 --> 32:34.700
...but every dime I've made
on criminals like Paul Wyatt...

32:34.870 --> 32:37.782
...has been spent to build
and operate this place.

32:37.957 --> 32:40.790
All that matters today
is that there will be no tomorrow...

32:40.960 --> 32:43.793
...for this boy
if I don't do this transplant.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.249
The donor material is already here.

32:46.423 --> 32:49.130
If we don't use it, it will die...

32:49.635 --> 32:51.717
...just like he Will.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.183
If we take him in now,
that kid won't make it.

33:03.357 --> 33:04.437
Can you live with that?

33:04.608 --> 33:07.224
Covington's notjust a surgeon, Keen.
He's a killer.

33:07.403 --> 33:10.065
Yeah, and right now
he's that boy's only chance.

33:10.239 --> 33:13.402
Look at his parents.
What if that were your kid?

33:13.576 --> 33:15.191
And what if something goes wrong?

33:15.369 --> 33:17.985
What if he dies on the table?
How do we explain that?

33:18.164 --> 33:21.076
Can you cover with Cooper and Aram?
Just buy us some time.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.536
Liz, this is way over the line.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.376
We have to let him do this.

33:38.058 --> 33:41.801
Niko, you're all in a sweat.
What's so important that it couldn't wait?

33:42.479 --> 33:44.435
We've been partners a long time...

33:44.607 --> 33:46.814
...and we've had more
than our share of success.

33:46.984 --> 33:48.815
So I wanted to pay you the courtesy...

33:48.986 --> 33:52.069
...of looking you in the eye
when I tell you you're out.

33:53.949 --> 33:54.984
I see.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.860
-And you're speaking for...?
-Everybody. We're united.

34:00.623 --> 34:02.579
You've become a liability.

34:02.750 --> 34:04.741
Don't forget who you're talking to.

34:04.919 --> 34:06.204
How could I?

34:06.378 --> 34:10.212
Especially
since it's our last conversation.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.758
Raymond Reddington...

34:12.635 --> 34:14.125
...Mr. Vargas.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.884
I may have misled you.

34:19.058 --> 34:23.267
Someone did take Berlin up on his offer,
but it wasn't Laskin and Russo.

34:23.437 --> 34:24.472
It was me.

34:27.691 --> 34:31.934
Well played, Niko.
I didn't think you had it in you.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.020
Kill him.

34:50.714 --> 34:54.502
I find chrome to be a bit ostentatious.

35:00.557 --> 35:02.218
I'm sorry, Mr. Demakis.

35:02.393 --> 35:04.475
The truth is,
I'm the one who misled you.

35:11.944 --> 35:14.060
You know, when I was 15...

35:14.238 --> 35:18.732
...I had a summerjob installing carpets
for Albert Kodagolian...

35:18.909 --> 35:21.070
...on Lake Charlevoix.

35:21.245 --> 35:22.655
Horrible job.

35:22.830 --> 35:25.116
Hot, indoors...

35:25.291 --> 35:28.033
...forced to listen to "The Gambler"
on 8â€”track...

35:28.210 --> 35:30.417
...while the rest of the world
was at the beach.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.999
Three days into the job,
I knew I had to quit.

35:33.173 --> 35:34.549
I asked my father for advice.

35:34.717 --> 35:38.084
All he wanted to know was whether
I'd given my word to Mr. Kodagolian...

35:38.262 --> 35:40.469
...that I'd work the summer.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.800
I told him I had.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.931
My father suggested I stick it out.

35:45.102 --> 35:46.933
I'd given my word.

35:47.396 --> 35:51.264
Worst eight weeks of my life.

35:51.984 --> 35:53.565
Until the last day.

35:53.736 --> 35:58.105
Mr. Kodagolian shows up at the job site,
pulls me aside, and tells me...

35:58.282 --> 36:03.618
...that in 27 years, no kid
has ever made it through the summer...

36:03.787 --> 36:06.745
...gives me a bonus, $40.

36:07.416 --> 36:10.158
The most valuable money
I've ever made.

36:10.336 --> 36:13.749
A priceless lesson about life.

36:15.341 --> 36:21.507
Value loyalty above all else.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.847
I buried the Iede.

36:26.018 --> 36:29.556
Turns out the Indonesian government
has chosen to contract our company...

36:29.730 --> 36:31.311
...to run the port of Tankulu.

36:31.482 --> 36:34.815
The deputy minister of Transportation
was not a fan.

36:34.985 --> 36:38.819
Fortunately, he was also gravely ill and
in desperate need of a heart transplant.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.274
He died this morning.

36:40.449 --> 36:44.738
Apparently, the arrangements he'd made
to secure a donor heart didn't pan out.

36:44.912 --> 36:47.494
The new deputy minister
sees things our way.

36:47.664 --> 36:48.790
Lucky,lguess.

36:48.957 --> 36:52.620
I don't believe luck
had anything to do with it.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.039
You're right.

36:55.214 --> 36:58.331
Luck rarely has anything to do with it.

37:02.930 --> 37:05.592
Honestly, how many times
have we discussed this?

37:05.766 --> 37:07.302
What?

37:08.268 --> 37:11.055
You-- You know I don't like
being around the bloody--

37:12.231 --> 37:14.847
I need to be allowed to leave the room
before the blood.

37:15.025 --> 37:17.061
You know I don't have
a strong constitution.

37:17.236 --> 37:19.727
Give him his seat. He's gonna faint.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.781
Oh, my.

38:00.529 --> 38:02.394
Do you have everything?

38:03.824 --> 38:05.485
Thank you.

38:07.870 --> 38:11.328
Hey, you think Reddington knew
that Covington was trying to save kids?

38:11.498 --> 38:14.706
For every child Covington saved,
there were three killers like B.B...

38:14.877 --> 38:17.914
-...he kept alive to victimize people.
-It's a trade-off I'd make.

38:20.174 --> 38:22.916
The fact you're thinking
about what trade-offs you'd make...

38:23.093 --> 38:24.333
...rules you'd ignore....

38:24.511 --> 38:27.753
The Agent Keen I met a year ago
would have never done that.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.617
You caught Covington,
and the child is in recovery.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.072
Sounds like a victory.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.114
Yeah.

38:56.084 --> 38:59.167
You guys don't celebrate
when you close a big case?

38:59.338 --> 39:01.420
Come on. Let me buy you a drink.

39:02.299 --> 39:04.290
Thanks, but I think
I'm just gonna head out.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.798
All you know about me
is that I found Reddington...

39:08.972 --> 39:11.554
...and whatever you might have read
in a slim dossier.

39:11.725 --> 39:15.684
And now we're working together
with all that that implies.

39:16.188 --> 39:19.555
-I'm sure you don't know what to think.
-You're wrong.

39:19.733 --> 39:22.520
I'm not wrong.
You're right not to trust me.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.605
Oh, you're right about that.

39:29.535 --> 39:33.744
You're wrong if you think
you found Reddington.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.614
If he was found,
it's because he wanted to be...

39:37.000 --> 39:40.993
-...and he wanted you to find him.
-Or maybe I'm just good at what I do.

39:41.171 --> 39:42.911
Is that so difficult to believe?

39:43.090 --> 39:46.082
If he wanted you here,
he has a reason.

39:47.094 --> 39:48.459
That's why I don't trust you.

39:49.680 --> 39:54.515
Because I don't know what the reason is
and I'm guessing neither do you.

40:16.290 --> 40:18.246
Hey, sir?

40:20.586 --> 40:26.798
Look, I'm sorry about that incident
with the frisking.

40:27.801 --> 40:28.881
Don't worry about it.

40:30.012 --> 40:32.845
So is that your thing?
Unprovoked frisking?

40:33.724 --> 40:36.807
Yeah. That's my thing.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.477
I'm a federal agent.

40:41.648 --> 40:44.685
Figured it'd be something like that.
Better safe than sorry.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.104
Have a good night.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.068
You too.

42:24.251 --> 42:25.912
You look so different.

42:27.337 --> 42:29.202
Not as different as you.
