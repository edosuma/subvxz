00:07.029 --> 00:09.312
<i>What started as a backyard
hobby for fruit farmers</i>

00:09.400 --> 00:12.013

00:37.259 --> 00:39.374
<i>the Buckball Hall Of Fame!</i>

00:39.461 --> 00:41.209
<i>Though given the

00:43.657 --> 00:46.907

00:47.769 --> 00:50.970
Do you think they
know we're here?

00:51.087 --> 00:53.579
I think they have
a pretty good idea.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.650
A pretty good idea about what?

01:40.807 --> 01:43.226
I can't believe
the ponies of Appleoosa

01:43.314 --> 01:44.606
built this place.

01:44.693 --> 01:47.569
Yeah. Especially after
their team lost to us.

01:47.657 --> 01:50.595
They must really love Buckball!

01:50.720 --> 01:55.216
Oh, my gosh! It's you! I
can't believe you're you!

01:55.353 --> 01:59.071
I mean here! I mean
Team Ponyville! Yahh!

01:59.181 --> 02:00.993
Yep. It's us.

02:01.095 --> 02:03.196
How much for an autograph?

02:03.367 --> 02:05.836
Bits for autographs, eh?

02:07.696 --> 02:10.092
Snails, you thinking
what I'm thinking?

02:10.180 --> 02:12.548
What's the sound of
one hoof clapping?

02:12.743 --> 02:15.118
Yeah. I mean, uh, no!

02:15.323 --> 02:18.568
How many of you would
pay for an autograph

02:18.656 --> 02:21.101
from my best friend, Snails!

02:25.251 --> 02:28.683
Wow. That's a lot of writing.

02:28.770 --> 02:31.719
I'm so proud they
decided to honor us.

02:31.964 --> 02:34.157
I never thought I'd
get to be in anything

02:34.245 --> 02:35.524
like a Hall of Fame.

02:35.612 --> 02:38.649
Me neither! Unless you
count a Royal Order

02:38.737 --> 02:40.253
of Party Planners
Memorial Library,

02:40.341 --> 02:42.636
which I don't, because
every party planner

02:42.724 --> 02:44.202
gets one of those eventually.

03:00.081 --> 03:02.079
I hope
Snails finishes signing

03:02.167 --> 03:04.252
autographs soon.
We can't play without him

03:04.339 --> 03:06.180
and if we lose or
forfeit one game,

03:06.268 --> 03:08.469
we'll be out of
the tournament.

03:08.557 --> 03:10.829
Well, he'd better get
his flank over here then.

03:10.917 --> 03:12.150
You have to win
the first few games

03:12.238 --> 03:13.786
without me cheering you on.

03:13.873 --> 03:15.788
Oh? Why?

03:15.917 --> 03:17.990
Applejack was too busy to come,

03:18.077 --> 03:21.432
so she made me promise to go
to all the museum exhibits

03:21.520 --> 03:22.555
and tell her about them.

03:22.643 --> 03:24.563
I'm gonna try and get in
first and beat the crowd

03:24.651 --> 03:26.431
so I can get back to
the tournament faster.

03:26.519 --> 03:28.100
Oh, then you'd
better hurry.

03:28.187 --> 03:29.966
It looks like there's
already a line.

03:30.054 --> 03:31.175
What?

03:34.594 --> 03:36.628
The doors aren't
even open yet.

03:36.908 --> 03:40.136
What kind of sports fan
camps out for a museum?

03:40.266 --> 03:44.617
The real question is: what
kind of sports fan doesn't?

03:44.704 --> 03:46.542
Quibble Pants?

03:46.630 --> 03:49.276
Rainbow Dash! Fancy
meeting you here.

03:49.364 --> 03:52.094
Fancy meeting me?
I'm a sports pony!

03:52.182 --> 03:53.284
Of course I'd be here.

03:53.372 --> 03:55.956
What's fancy is
you being here...

03:56.044 --> 03:58.026
if fancy meant
confusing.

03:58.251 --> 04:00.667
There's nothing fancy
or confusing about it.

04:00.755 --> 04:03.706
You can't keep me away
from that buckball rink.

04:03.823 --> 04:05.628
I'm the biggest
fan there is.

04:06.424 --> 04:10.307
Uh, it's a buckball
field. And you are?

04:10.395 --> 04:14.597
Ah, sure! With all the
bucking and the balling...

04:14.749 --> 04:16.089
on the buckball field.

04:16.177 --> 04:18.459
Which is where they
play... buckball.

04:18.547 --> 04:21.563
I, I... I wanted to be
first inside to experience

04:21.651 --> 04:24.222
the grand history
of the sport.

04:24.310 --> 04:27.726
I guess only a real fan
would understand that.

04:27.813 --> 04:28.828
What?

04:28.915 --> 04:30.847
Oh! Perfect timing.

04:31.284 --> 04:34.066
Rainbow Dash, I'd like
you to meet Clear Sky,

04:34.153 --> 04:36.869
the most amazing
pony I've ever met.

04:36.956 --> 04:39.171
Um, you've met Daring Do,

04:39.258 --> 04:42.641
so that's probably an
exaggeration. No offense.

04:42.728 --> 04:44.511
None taken. When it
comes to describing

04:44.599 --> 04:47.401
your special somepony, a
little exaggeration's normal.

04:47.489 --> 04:49.972
And I feel the
same way about you.

04:51.342 --> 04:52.768
And who is this?

04:52.856 --> 04:54.768
This is my daughter,
Wind Sprint.

04:54.870 --> 04:58.453
And she is pretty amazing too!

04:58.540 --> 05:00.588
Wind, did you thank
Quibble for camping out,

05:00.676 --> 05:01.924
so we'd be first in line?

05:02.088 --> 05:03.409
Thanks.

05:03.497 --> 05:06.141
No problem! I-I-I probably
would have done it anyway.

05:06.229 --> 05:10.329
I mean, I can't wait
to see the evolution

05:10.417 --> 05:13.038
of the buck basket
from farm to field.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.173
That sounds just...

05:14.260 --> 05:17.698
I mean, wow! There
is a lot to see.

05:20.232 --> 05:22.253
I'd rather
see the game.

05:22.341 --> 05:25.116
Oh. Well, I mean,
sure. That makes sense.

05:25.204 --> 05:27.370
We could just go to the
tournament instead.

05:27.458 --> 05:30.022
No. Quibble planned
this whole thing for us

05:30.109 --> 05:32.644
and you could be a
little more appreciative.

05:37.913 --> 05:40.618
I kinda wanted to
skip the museum too.

05:41.786 --> 05:43.926
But I promised a friend

05:44.014 --> 05:45.571
that I'd check out
all the exhibits.

05:45.659 --> 05:47.579
Ugh. All of them?

05:48.602 --> 05:50.709
You know, I'd like
a chance to catch up

05:50.796 --> 05:52.399
with Rainbow Dash.
Why don't we split up?

05:52.487 --> 05:55.172
We'll cover more
ground that way and...

05:57.878 --> 06:01.282
So... you and
Clear Sky, huh?

06:01.370 --> 06:05.860
Ah! Yeah. She's great. Honestly,
I've never been happier...

06:06.112 --> 06:08.313
which is why I need your help!

06:08.401 --> 06:10.735
I don't know what
any of this stuff is!

06:11.563 --> 06:12.587
What do you mean?

06:12.675 --> 06:15.469
See this? I don't
know what it is.

06:15.557 --> 06:16.905
A ball?

06:17.157 --> 06:19.408
And this? No idea.

06:19.496 --> 06:22.134
It's a basket. How do you
not know what these are?

06:22.222 --> 06:25.006
I'm not even 100% sure
what "bucking" is.

06:25.094 --> 06:27.345
I literally know
nothing about buckball,

06:27.433 --> 06:29.000
or any other sport!

06:29.095 --> 06:32.912
Well, I figured you weren't the
sportiest pony in Equestria.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.391
But Wind Sprint is!

06:34.479 --> 06:36.250
And her dad was some
big athlete too.

06:36.338 --> 06:38.805
I can't compete with that.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.352
I really want things with
Clear Sky to work out,

06:43.440 --> 06:46.571
but if Wind doesn't like
me, I might as well give up.

06:47.009 --> 06:48.157
Uh, why?

06:48.245 --> 06:50.844
They're a family.
Even if it's OK with Clear Sky,

06:50.956 --> 06:52.371
I wouldn't ask them to
make me a part of it

06:52.458 --> 06:54.336
if Wind Sprint isn't on board.

06:58.235 --> 06:59.712
I thought if I
could convince Wind

06:59.799 --> 07:01.032
I was a big buckball fan,

07:01.120 --> 07:02.116
we'd have something
to bond over,

07:02.204 --> 07:04.391
but I'm pretty sure
she's on to me.

07:04.479 --> 07:05.705
Here.

07:05.955 --> 07:08.619
Give it a shot. It's easy!

07:13.567 --> 07:16.291
Yeah, I don't think
she's fooled.

07:17.733 --> 07:19.588
Could you talk to her?

07:19.705 --> 07:21.549
I mean, you're a
famous sports pony;

07:21.637 --> 07:22.838
you'd know what to say.

07:22.926 --> 07:25.463
Maybe you could
talk me up a little.

07:26.103 --> 07:29.525
No problem! I've
totally got your flank.

07:34.562 --> 07:38.361
Trust me. The game's a lot
harder to play with apples.

07:38.471 --> 07:39.900
You play?

07:39.988 --> 07:41.979
Who do you think
taught them?

07:42.067 --> 07:44.127
Of course, being a
Wonderbolt takes up

07:44.215 --> 07:45.018
most of my time,

07:45.106 --> 07:47.322
so I don't get to practice
as much as I'd like.

07:47.417 --> 07:51.057
Wait. You're Rainbow
Dash, the Wonderbolt?

07:51.145 --> 07:53.916
Whoa! My dad was
a great flyer too.

07:54.004 --> 07:57.908
You don't say. You know,
Quibble's pretty sporty too.

08:01.645 --> 08:03.393
If you say so.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.338
I think I've seen
enough of this museum

08:07.426 --> 08:11.885
for three Applejacks. Let's
go watch some buckball!

08:11.973 --> 08:13.604
That sounds awesome!

08:13.692 --> 08:17.424
Oh! But first I got you
a little surprise.

08:18.696 --> 08:20.530
Oh. A book.

08:21.708 --> 08:25.088
Oh, not just a book,
it's a buckball almanac.

08:25.176 --> 08:26.624
This thing has
every buckball fact

08:26.712 --> 08:28.894
and statistic
ever recorded!

08:28.982 --> 08:30.030
Wow.

08:30.228 --> 08:31.719
I know! I never

08:31.807 --> 08:34.033
realized there was
so much math in buckball.

08:34.121 --> 08:35.751
I mean, this game's
got more numbers

08:35.840 --> 08:37.361
than Ogres & Oubliettes!

08:39.991 --> 08:41.432
Thanks?

08:41.520 --> 08:44.063
I guess I could hold it for you.

08:44.152 --> 08:45.867
You know, so you don't
have to carry it.

08:45.955 --> 08:47.643
Can we go to the game now?

08:47.731 --> 08:49.212
Sure, honey.

08:49.517 --> 08:51.283
Listen, Q, this trip
was a lovely idea

08:51.371 --> 08:52.282
and the book was sweet,

08:52.370 --> 08:54.260
but you don't have
to try so hard.

08:54.482 --> 08:56.197
Everything's
going to be fine.

08:58.216 --> 09:01.332
Not even my presents
are in the ball court!

09:01.420 --> 09:02.635
Do you mean ballpark?

09:02.764 --> 09:05.244
Do I? I don't know!
One thing's for sure,

09:05.332 --> 09:07.461
Wind is never going to
like a pony like me.

09:08.684 --> 09:10.158
Of course she will.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.346
She just needs to
see your sporty side.

09:12.443 --> 09:14.518
I don't have a sporty side.

09:14.637 --> 09:19.255
Everypony has a sporty side
and we're gonna find yours.

09:19.345 --> 09:22.432
By the end of the day,
I'm going to turn you into

09:22.520 --> 09:25.900
the sportiest pony
in Equestria!

09:33.256 --> 09:35.234
Look, I'm not saying
it's a terrible idea...

09:35.322 --> 09:36.924
but it's a terrible idea!

09:37.012 --> 09:39.721
You can't turn me into an
athlete. It's impossible!

09:40.011 --> 09:43.154
It's either that or be
yourself and bond with Wind

09:43.242 --> 09:46.640
over comic books and
role-playing games.

09:49.917 --> 09:53.700
I have a 17 charisma.
Don't you think I tried?

09:53.918 --> 09:55.600
She doesn't even like Daring Do.

09:55.688 --> 09:57.636
She thinks she's
not athletic enough.

09:57.854 --> 09:59.502
WHAT? Wow.

09:59.620 --> 10:02.789
We need to get started on
operation sportify asap!

10:04.698 --> 10:07.052
To figure out what
your sporty side is,

10:07.140 --> 10:08.988
we just need to see
what your skills are.

10:09.147 --> 10:12.196
Everypony's got
something: Speed...

10:15.528 --> 10:17.120
Strength...

10:17.328 --> 10:18.676
Whoa!

10:18.834 --> 10:20.464
Agility!

10:21.135 --> 10:24.573
'Course, some ponies
can do it all.

10:24.745 --> 10:27.074
You're amazing.
But what about me?

10:27.162 --> 10:30.113
Right. We should
probably start small.

10:30.476 --> 10:31.957
I'll pass the ball to you

10:32.044 --> 10:34.027
and you just pass
it back to me. OK?

10:34.309 --> 10:35.666
OK. Uh huh...

10:42.981 --> 10:44.870
and buckball!

10:44.980 --> 10:46.449
Ow.

10:46.714 --> 10:50.230
OK. Maybe agility's
not your thing.

10:50.318 --> 10:51.334
Ready?

10:51.430 --> 10:53.128
If I say no, do I
still have to run?

10:53.216 --> 10:54.238
Yep.

10:54.326 --> 10:55.337
Can we get on with this?

10:55.425 --> 10:57.745
Snails and I did so well
with the autographs,

10:57.833 --> 10:59.878
we decided to expand,

11:00.017 --> 11:03.517
and these souvenirs are not
going to sell themselves.

11:03.605 --> 11:05.787
Remember. Think speed.

11:05.875 --> 11:06.789
Got it.

11:06.877 --> 11:09.425
On your marks... get set...

11:09.581 --> 11:12.598
Speed... Speed.

11:12.823 --> 11:14.466
Go!

11:14.553 --> 11:17.269
Speed! Speed. Speed...

11:17.363 --> 11:20.732
WHEW! OK!
What a race! Right?

11:23.131 --> 11:25.084
Oh... so much for speed.

11:25.172 --> 11:29.045
This was fun, but I've
gotta get back to work!

11:30.299 --> 11:32.314
Come on, Quibble. You got this!

11:32.604 --> 11:36.654
I. Got. This...! I...

11:38.466 --> 11:40.992
This is hopeless! I
don't have any skills.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.527
Not agility. Not speed.

11:42.614 --> 11:45.928
I can't even lift more than
one book, AND I LOVE BOOKS!

11:46.139 --> 11:48.912
If we had time to train,
I know I could mold you

11:49.000 --> 11:50.967
into the perfect sports pony.

11:52.883 --> 11:56.333
Or at least a sportier pony.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.477
Who knows how long
that would take?

11:58.564 --> 12:01.079
I need to get Wind
to like me now.

12:05.437 --> 12:07.811
Maybe you're not the best
athlete in Equestria,

12:07.930 --> 12:10.345
or the most coordinated,
or the fastest,

12:10.441 --> 12:12.456
or even a little bit strong.

12:12.636 --> 12:13.621
I-I'm sorry, wait.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.627
Is this supposed to be
making me feel better?

12:15.714 --> 12:16.595
Because it's not.

12:16.682 --> 12:18.630
But none of that matters

12:18.717 --> 12:21.686
because I just figured
out how to sportify you.

12:37.483 --> 12:40.581
<i>And with that score, the
stars of Team Ponyville</i>

12:40.669 --> 12:42.487
<i>advance to the next round!</i>

12:42.574 --> 12:44.122
<i>If they keep winning like this,</i>

12:44.209 --> 12:46.060
<i>they'll never get off the field!</i>

12:46.148 --> 12:49.333
Wow. The players from
Ponyville are so good!

12:49.432 --> 12:50.579
They sure are!

12:50.682 --> 12:52.544
Quibble! Where
have you been?

12:52.710 --> 12:55.544
I was hoping we'd all watch
the tournament together.

12:57.786 --> 12:59.935
Oh, I've just been
arranging for us to hang out

13:00.023 --> 13:04.497
with a few of my close
friends from Team Ponyville!

13:04.860 --> 13:06.935
That is, if
Wind's up for it.

13:10.575 --> 13:13.130
This is wonderful, Q,
but I still feel like

13:13.238 --> 13:15.349
you're trying too hard
to get Wind's approval.

13:15.505 --> 13:18.362
This is so great. Pinkie
Pie and Fluttershy

13:18.450 --> 13:20.075
are the best players out there!

13:20.163 --> 13:22.212
Well, you can
thank Quibble.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.200
Wonderbolts,
Buckball stars...

13:24.288 --> 13:26.815
He's friends with the
sportiest ponies around,

13:26.903 --> 13:29.841
so he must be pretty
sporty too, right?

13:30.029 --> 13:32.800
Ooooh. So this
is Quibble Pants.

13:32.888 --> 13:34.974
Rainbow Dash told us
all about how you two

13:35.062 --> 13:36.509
spent a whole
Daring Do Convention

13:36.597 --> 13:38.583
geeking out together
about books!

13:38.671 --> 13:40.517
And even though at
first, she thought you were

13:40.605 --> 13:42.747
the most annoying fan
pony she ever met,

13:42.835 --> 13:45.341
you two eventually
became friends.

13:46.438 --> 13:47.450
Uh...

13:47.592 --> 13:49.720
I guess even sports
ponies agree:

13:49.808 --> 13:52.581
Quibble's a pony you like
more and more over time.

13:52.669 --> 13:53.785
Agh!

13:53.993 --> 13:57.599
Knowing sports ponies isn't
the same as being one.

13:58.064 --> 14:01.560
What's it like playing in
front of all those fans?

14:02.121 --> 14:03.802
Um...

14:04.232 --> 14:05.693
I guess you'll find out!

14:05.863 --> 14:07.114
What do you mean?

14:07.202 --> 14:09.974
Yes. What do you mean?

14:10.101 --> 14:14.528
I think it's time we told Wind
about your next surprise.

14:14.832 --> 14:18.693
Q, Wind really doesn't
need any more surprises.

14:19.134 --> 14:20.528
Is it another book?

14:20.616 --> 14:21.855
A, books
are awesome,

14:21.943 --> 14:24.599
and B, this is way more
awesomer than that.

14:24.702 --> 14:27.018
For the tournament half-time
show, you and Quibble

14:27.106 --> 14:28.505
are gonna play a
game of buckball

14:28.593 --> 14:30.374
against Team
Ponyville!

14:30.482 --> 14:31.943
WE'RE WHAT?

14:51.964 --> 14:53.963
You should probably stretch.

14:54.057 --> 14:56.807
No amount of stretching
is going to make this OK.

14:56.895 --> 14:58.198
What were you thinking?

14:58.286 --> 15:00.168
Look, you wanted to
impress Wind Sprint,

15:00.256 --> 15:01.501
and this just made sense.

15:01.589 --> 15:03.795
Really? How does me
making a fool of myself

15:03.882 --> 15:04.696
in front of her, Sky,

15:04.783 --> 15:07.199
and a billion buckball
fans make sense?

15:07.286 --> 15:09.361
Don't worry, I've
got your flank.

15:09.449 --> 15:11.297
I already talked to
Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy.

15:11.385 --> 15:13.822
They're totally going
to make you look good.

15:15.402 --> 15:19.400
Oh. OK. Maybe this isn't the
absolute worst idea ever.

15:19.488 --> 15:22.376
<i>Mares and
stallions, foals and colts.</i>

15:22.464 --> 15:25.850
<i>Put your hooves together for
today's halftime presentation</i>

15:25.938 --> 15:29.554
<i>as buckball's biggest stars
take on a team of fans</i>

15:29.641 --> 15:30.820
<i>just like you!</i>

15:49.849 --> 15:52.900
<i>And that's one
for the Ponyville Champs.</i>

15:53.040 --> 15:56.736
<i>Looks like these fans don't
know what they signed up for.</i>

16:07.980 --> 16:10.529
Oh, no,
Quibble's wide open

16:10.616 --> 16:13.493
and I'll never get
there in time to block.

16:21.425 --> 16:23.367
<i>Ooooh! Looks
like our fan team</i>

16:23.455 --> 16:25.672
<i>needs to work on their passing.</i>

16:40.445 --> 16:45.656
<i>And the fan team finally
scores for the other side!</i>

16:46.043 --> 16:49.512
<i>That makes three.
Team Ponyville wins!</i>

16:52.658 --> 16:54.832
It says very clearly
on page six forty-seven

16:54.920 --> 16:57.203
of the expanded buckball
tournament rules that

16:57.296 --> 16:59.711
"a goal is scored when an
earth pony sends the ball

16:59.798 --> 17:02.847
into a basket," but it
doesn't say which basket.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.309
Yeah, I'm pretty
sure eveypony knows

17:05.396 --> 17:07.746
you're not supposed to score
in the other team's goal.

17:07.906 --> 17:09.746
But the rules don't say that.

17:09.855 --> 17:11.923
If that goal is
ours, it's only 2-1

17:12.010 --> 17:13.290
and we can keep playing.

17:13.377 --> 17:14.858
I don't want to!

17:14.945 --> 17:16.861
You're not a sports pony.

17:16.948 --> 17:19.628
It's not fun playing
this game with you.

17:22.363 --> 17:24.801
I was just trying to
get her to like me.

17:24.890 --> 17:28.128
I know. But I told you,
you didn't need to.

17:28.269 --> 17:30.720
You and I have to
rethink all of this.

17:37.860 --> 17:39.575
What are
you doing out here?

17:39.663 --> 17:41.785
Apparently, this book
is as close to sports

17:41.873 --> 17:42.821
as I'll ever get.

17:42.908 --> 17:45.557
Come on, that goal you
scored for the other team

17:45.644 --> 17:47.525
was amazing!

17:47.612 --> 17:49.429
Thanks for trying, Rainbow Dash,

17:49.517 --> 17:50.679
but I think we can both agree

17:50.767 --> 17:54.344
the whole sportify
idea was a big flop.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.890
What? We haven't
even gotten started!

17:56.978 --> 17:59.427
I've got, like, seven
more top notch ideas

17:59.515 --> 18:01.830
to turn you into a
super sporty pony.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.742
Wind's already made up
her mind and so have I.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.344
It's time to throw up the towel.

18:07.432 --> 18:10.836
It's throw in the towel,
and that's ridiculous!

18:11.094 --> 18:12.405
You can't just give up.

18:12.493 --> 18:14.615
Wind and Sky deserve
a pony they both like

18:14.703 --> 18:17.388
in their lives. Besides, Sky
wants to "rethink" things,

18:17.476 --> 18:19.575
so I'm just beating
her to the lunch.

18:19.749 --> 18:21.935
It's beating her
to the punch.

18:22.047 --> 18:23.828
And it's barely a
sports reference.

18:23.915 --> 18:25.697
How do you not
know that?

18:25.784 --> 18:32.427
Because I don't know
anything about sports!

18:33.251 --> 18:36.154
And pretending I did
just made things worse.

18:36.242 --> 18:38.557
So you should
stop pretending.

18:38.731 --> 18:41.700
Look, you are
terrible at sports.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.370
You're uncoordinated,
slow, weak...

18:44.458 --> 18:47.508
OK, again, not really
making me feel better.

18:47.596 --> 18:50.058
And you're completely
clueless about anything

18:50.146 --> 18:51.482
having to do
with athletics,

18:51.570 --> 18:53.409
but maybe I'M not the pony

18:53.497 --> 18:55.543
you should have
come to for help...

18:55.881 --> 18:57.014
Oh!

18:58.343 --> 19:00.425
I wish we didn't even come here.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.248
Quibble thought you'd like it.

19:02.336 --> 19:04.902
Well, I don't. And
I don't like him.

19:05.150 --> 19:06.497
Why do you like him?

19:06.701 --> 19:09.066
Because he's kind and smart

19:09.154 --> 19:10.978
and his friends certainly
seem to care about him,

19:11.066 --> 19:12.660
which is always a good sign.

19:12.755 --> 19:15.471
I don't care how many
ponies care about him;

19:15.620 --> 19:18.410
they're not going to
make me forget about Dad.

19:18.599 --> 19:21.561
Oh, sweetheart,
I know Quibble's trying too hard,

19:21.700 --> 19:23.749
but he doesn't want you
to stop loving your dad;

19:23.837 --> 19:25.756
he just wants you to like him.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.053
And I think maybe there's
enough room in your heart

19:28.209 --> 19:29.264
to do both.

19:29.352 --> 19:31.303
Hey there.
Glad I found you

19:31.399 --> 19:32.780
because I have a
confession to make.

19:32.937 --> 19:34.530
I know it's hard to imagine,

19:34.618 --> 19:37.592
but I'm not really
all that sporty.

19:37.745 --> 19:39.394
Ah!
No!

19:39.590 --> 19:41.153
I'm sorry I was trying so hard

19:41.241 --> 19:42.020
to convince you otherwise.

19:42.108 --> 19:44.366
I just really wanted
us to get along,

19:44.561 --> 19:46.155
but I guess it backfired.

19:46.243 --> 19:48.303
Do you think we
could start over?

19:49.060 --> 19:51.231
Maybe we could watch some
of the tournament together

19:51.319 --> 19:53.404
and you could teach
me some sports stuff?

20:01.056 --> 20:03.470
OK, that's their goal.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.617
I'll try to remember
that if I ever decide

20:05.705 --> 20:09.071
to play buckball again,
but I probably won't.

20:09.337 --> 20:10.933
Oh, look. Pinkie
Pie's going to flip

20:11.022 --> 20:13.043
and triple bounce the
ball into the goal.

20:16.441 --> 20:17.732
How did you know that?

20:17.820 --> 20:19.090
It's right here.

20:19.264 --> 20:20.887
Pinkie flips and
triple bounce-bucks

20:20.975 --> 20:23.857
over 83% of her shots
from the northwest section

20:23.945 --> 20:26.528
of the field when the wind
is blowing from the east.

20:26.616 --> 20:29.484
Huh. I guess this book's
kind of cool after all.

20:31.634 --> 20:33.791
Look, Sky, I know
you're thinking

20:33.879 --> 20:36.219
of calling it quits between
us, and after today,

20:36.391 --> 20:37.572
I don't blame you,

20:37.660 --> 20:39.842
but Wind and I just
made a connection!

20:39.952 --> 20:42.334
Calling it quits? What
are you talking about?

20:42.422 --> 20:44.936
You said you wanted
to rethink things.

20:45.024 --> 20:47.103
Yeah, things like
having your friend

20:47.191 --> 20:49.236
help you pretend
to be a sports pony

20:49.324 --> 20:50.875
so Wind would like you.

20:51.026 --> 20:53.540
What? I-I...
Oh!

20:53.705 --> 20:55.705
I didn't.

20:57.539 --> 21:00.845
Wha? Me?

21:01.050 --> 21:03.220
Mom, look what
Quibble showed me!

21:03.308 --> 21:06.103
When Fluttershy flies higher
than the other Pegasus,

21:06.244 --> 21:10.128
Pinkie scores 92% of the
time! And it just happened.

21:10.215 --> 21:12.157
Wow.
You'd better watch out

21:12.245 --> 21:13.782
or you're gpnna
start to like books.

21:13.870 --> 21:16.064
I guess that wouldn't be so bad.

21:17.266 --> 21:19.829
Huh. Looks like you
didn't need sportiness,

21:19.983 --> 21:21.631
famous ponies, or lavish gifts

21:21.726 --> 21:23.040
to bond with Wind after all.

21:23.128 --> 21:25.634
Technically, he still
needed to buy her the book,

21:25.730 --> 21:27.011
but that's it.
