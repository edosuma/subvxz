The whole gang together.

01:20.786 --> 01:23.487
Well, almost
the whole gang.

01:23.489 --> 01:26.573
Yeah, there's just one beloved
piece of the puzzle missing.

01:28.910 --> 01:31.128
That bottle of 30-year
Glen McKenna scotch.

01:31.130 --> 01:32.829
Mmm...

01:32.831 --> 01:34.214
<i>So far, that weekend</i>

01:34.216 --> 01:37.134

Also, where the
hell is Marshall?

01:44.059 --> 01:47.794
I still can't believe he took
the judgeship behind my back.

01:47.796 --> 01:51.431
Look, I know this is messy, my
dream versus Marshall's dream.

01:51.433 --> 01:53.717
I won't force you guys
to choose sides.

01:53.719 --> 01:55.736
Good, because I totally side
with Marshall.

01:55.738 --> 01:58.355
That would've been so awkward.

01:58.357 --> 02:00.657
Hey, let's go see if they have
any Glen McKenna up at the bar.

02:00.659 --> 02:01.975
Okay.

02:01.977 --> 02:03.577
Hey, look, don't be mad.

02:03.579 --> 02:05.245
Barney just thinks
that if he has a judge friend,

02:05.247 --> 02:08.615
he can get all of his citations
for public urination thrown out.

02:08.616 --> 02:10.834
How often does Barney pee
in public?

02:10.836 --> 02:13.287
A lot.

02:13.289 --> 02:14.838
But don't worry.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.123
I'm on your side.

02:16.125 --> 02:17.257
Aw...

02:17.259 --> 02:19.760

02:19.762 --> 02:22.329
<i>Oh, boy, who's this idiot?</i>

02:22.331 --> 02:26.333
And which one of us is he gonna
<i>try to make the sex on?</i>

02:26.335 --> 02:28.218
You both look beautiful tonight.

02:28.220 --> 02:30.520
<i>Bro, going for the tricycle.</i>

02:30.522 --> 02:34.841
<i>Can you imagine having</i>

02:34.843 --> 02:36.176
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

02:36.178 --> 02:37.844
<i>You, me and this guy,</i>

02:37.846 --> 02:39.730
<i>naked, going at it.</i>

02:39.732 --> 02:43.317
<i>Then he gets tired and it's</i>
<i>just you and me going at it.</i>

02:43.319 --> 02:45.569
<i>Uh, Lily...</i>
<i>That'd be so stupid.</i>

02:45.571 --> 02:48.655
<i>So stupid...</i>

02:48.657 --> 02:50.857
Um, okay, I'll shoot him down.

02:50.859 --> 02:54.161
By the way, I am so psyched
for the wedding tomorrow, Robin.

02:54.163 --> 02:55.996
I'm truly honored
that you and Barney

02:55.998 --> 02:57.331
asked me to be a part of it.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.800
We're honored...

02:59.802 --> 03:01.534
you're here...

03:02.470 --> 03:04.554
...valued invitee.

03:05.474 --> 03:07.224
<i>Help me. Who is this?</i>

03:07.226 --> 03:10.344
<i>Maybe he's one of your</i>
<i>long-lost Canadian cousins?</i>

03:10.346 --> 03:14.147
Uh, do you happen to have all
of your fingers and teeth?

03:14.149 --> 03:16.650
Uh... yeah.

03:16.652 --> 03:18.551
<i>Not one of my cousins.</i>

03:19.654 --> 03:21.905
Hey, thanks again
for picking us up.

03:21.907 --> 03:23.824
It's been a crazy
couple of days.

03:23.826 --> 03:25.692
You can't imagine
what we've been through.

03:25.694 --> 03:26.827
Wait, let me guess.

03:26.829 --> 03:29.830
You were visiting a relative,

03:29.832 --> 03:31.682
maybe... your mother?

03:31.684 --> 03:32.783
And I'm getting

03:32.785 --> 03:34.234
a Midwest vibe,

03:34.236 --> 03:35.936
somewhere like...
Wisconsin...

03:35.938 --> 03:37.254
...no, Minnesota?

03:37.256 --> 03:38.822
Wow.

03:38.824 --> 03:40.874
You're-you're, like,
really good at this.

03:40.876 --> 03:43.576
You're planning an overseas trip
with your wife.

03:43.578 --> 03:45.545
I'm seeing a...

03:45.547 --> 03:47.747
a feisty redhead who loves art.

03:47.749 --> 03:48.765
She just got a job

03:48.767 --> 03:50.183
in Europe, maybe France?

03:50.185 --> 03:51.584
No. Italy?

03:53.188 --> 03:55.689
Total shot in the dark, but...

03:55.691 --> 03:56.890
Rome?

03:59.444 --> 04:01.695
Maybe I'll just, like...

04:01.697 --> 04:02.929
I'll get out right here.

04:02.931 --> 04:06.116
You're not going anywhere.

04:07.552 --> 04:08.902
No, I'm just messin' with ya.

04:08.904 --> 04:10.370
I rode the train with your wife.

04:10.372 --> 04:11.872
She told me all about you.

04:11.874 --> 04:13.073
You must be Marshall.

04:17.795 --> 04:19.296
Um...

04:19.298 --> 04:20.664
I was checking on the baby.

04:22.134 --> 04:23.950
Wait-wait a minute,
wait a minute.

04:23.952 --> 04:25.886
So you guys both got locked out

04:25.888 --> 04:28.055
on the roof in your pajamas?

04:28.057 --> 04:31.791
You guys are hilarious
and adorable!

04:31.793 --> 04:33.793
<i>Any idea who this guy is?</i>

04:33.795 --> 04:35.645
<i>No, but I like that he gets</i>

04:35.647 --> 04:38.065
<i>how hilarious</i>
<i>and adorable we are!</i>

04:38.067 --> 04:40.233
We are <i>hilarious and adorable!</i>

04:40.235 --> 04:41.985
I'll get the next round.

04:41.987 --> 04:43.403
Oh, thanks.

04:43.405 --> 04:44.771
Thanks, Lil.

04:44.773 --> 04:48.241
Hey, I'm sorry if
I barged in on you guys.

04:48.243 --> 04:49.776
I can be a little overeager

04:49.778 --> 04:51.778
to connect sometimes.

04:51.780 --> 04:53.780
Probably because of
my childhood.

04:53.782 --> 04:55.198
Right.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.584
Because of that thing
that happened.

04:57.586 --> 04:59.319
My mother died
on a hunting trip

04:59.321 --> 05:01.488
when I was very young.

05:01.490 --> 05:03.874
Yeah, that's it,
that's the thing.

05:03.876 --> 05:05.876
Sorry, blah, too heavy!

05:06.879 --> 05:07.878
So, Robin.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.212
What's going on...

05:09.214 --> 05:10.764
with you?

05:10.766 --> 05:12.299
Oh, nothing.

05:12.301 --> 05:14.134
I mean, uh, nothing big, anyway.

05:14.136 --> 05:15.519
Hey, hey, hey...

05:15.521 --> 05:18.004
this is me
you're talking to.

05:19.173 --> 05:21.525
Well, there is
this thing with Lily...

05:21.527 --> 05:23.059
You know, Ted,

05:23.061 --> 05:24.778
if you really want
to get a bottle

05:24.780 --> 05:26.696
of Glen McKenna 30-year
for Barney,

05:26.698 --> 05:29.349
I got that last one at
the Farhampton Liquor Store.

05:29.351 --> 05:31.618
The security there
is a total joke!

05:31.620 --> 05:33.620
No, see, I don't
want to know that.

05:33.622 --> 05:36.123
I won't be an accomplice
to grand larceny.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.691
I am not confirming
or denying a thing.

05:38.693 --> 05:40.710
But there's a really high window
in the storage room

05:40.712 --> 05:42.028
and if you climb up...

05:42.030 --> 05:43.914
La la la la la,
I'm not listening!

05:43.916 --> 05:45.215
I love Barney,

05:45.217 --> 05:46.666
but I'm not going
to jail for him.

05:46.668 --> 05:48.051
What? Really?
Why not?

05:48.053 --> 05:49.202
I'd go to jail for you.

05:49.204 --> 05:50.804
No, you wouldn't.
Yes, I would.

05:50.806 --> 05:52.005
Going to jail for
your best friend?

05:52.007 --> 05:53.056
That's the dream.

05:53.058 --> 05:54.207
Really?

05:54.209 --> 05:55.475
That's the dream?

05:55.477 --> 05:58.762
Yeah, it's the most noble--
nay, bro-ble--

05:58.764 --> 06:00.481
thing a bro can do
for a fellow bro.

06:00.506 --> 06:01.048
Mm-hmm.

06:01.049 --> 06:03.567
So yes, Ted, that's the dream.

06:03.569 --> 06:06.019
You're too liberal with the phrase
"That's the dream."

06:06.021 --> 06:07.571
Name one other time
I've said that!

06:07.573 --> 06:09.823
A suit made of prosciutto
so you can eat your way naked,

06:09.825 --> 06:10.874
"That's the dream."

06:10.876 --> 06:13.076
A pack of lions
fighting a tyrannosaurus,

06:13.078 --> 06:14.194
"That's the dream."

06:14.196 --> 06:15.162
Being able to take

06:15.164 --> 06:16.413
a whole year's
worth of dumps

06:16.415 --> 06:17.998
in one, nonstop
24-hour period

06:18.000 --> 06:19.166
then not having
to dump again

06:19.168 --> 06:20.116
for the rest
of the year,

06:20.118 --> 06:21.418
"That's the dream."

06:21.420 --> 06:23.903
I never said Dump Day
was the dream.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.373
I said science is
this close to a pill.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.408
There can only be
one "the dream"!

06:28.410 --> 06:30.577
You're saying it's going
to jail for a bro?

06:30.579 --> 06:31.761
You're comfortable
with that being

06:31.763 --> 06:33.547
the one and only
dream, forever?

06:34.382 --> 06:35.549
Yes.

06:35.551 --> 06:37.917
Great, now you can never
use that phrase again.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.919
And for me,
that's the dream.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.389
Hey, Lily, Robin just
told me about Italy!

06:42.391 --> 06:44.924
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be great.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.360
Well, that is, if I can
convince my husband

06:47.362 --> 06:49.229
to keep his promise
and move there with me.

06:49.231 --> 06:50.647
Robin, I know

06:50.649 --> 06:52.482
you told me you want
Marshall to win,

06:52.484 --> 06:53.433
but I don't know.

06:53.435 --> 06:55.452
I gotta side
with Lily on this one.

06:55.454 --> 06:56.620
Later, skaters.

07:00.441 --> 07:02.826
Thanks again
for saving us.

07:02.828 --> 07:04.777
Well, I don't normally
stop like that,

07:04.779 --> 07:07.780
but I just had to for the cutest
hitchhiker in the world!

07:07.782 --> 07:09.966
Thank you.

07:09.968 --> 07:11.885
Oh, you were talking
about Marvin.

07:11.887 --> 07:15.055
Sorry, it's been
a really, really long day.

07:15.057 --> 07:16.840
When we get there,
I'll buy you a drink.

07:16.842 --> 07:19.959
Thank you,
but, um, after I drop you off,

07:19.961 --> 07:22.262
I'm heading back to the city.

07:22.264 --> 07:23.346
What?
I thought you said that

07:23.348 --> 07:24.397
your-your band's
playing the wedding.

07:24.399 --> 07:25.432
Why are you leaving?

07:25.434 --> 07:26.633
The lead singer.

07:26.635 --> 07:27.734
He's the devil.

07:27.736 --> 07:29.185
He's a total fire-starter.

07:29.187 --> 07:30.320
He just ruins
people's lives

07:30.322 --> 07:31.855
for his own amusement.

07:31.857 --> 07:33.806
You know, he will walk
up to two friends,

07:33.808 --> 07:35.525
he will find the one thing

07:35.527 --> 07:38.662
that will destroy their
friendship and just-- poof!--

07:38.664 --> 07:40.330
burn it to the ground.

07:40.332 --> 07:41.615
Wow.

07:41.617 --> 07:42.916
What's his name?

07:44.368 --> 07:45.835
What's poppin',
mi amigos?

07:45.837 --> 07:47.504
<i>Darren.</i>

07:50.662 --> 07:52.385
You're rooting
for Marshall?!

07:52.386 --> 07:54.336
Well, why don't you just get

07:54.338 --> 07:55.537
a Team Marshall T-shirt?

07:55.539 --> 07:56.539
What size are you?

07:56.541 --> 07:57.573
Extra-traitor?

07:57.575 --> 07:59.408
No. No, okay...

07:59.410 --> 08:01.527
What I said was...

08:01.529 --> 08:03.429
See, all I meant was...

08:03.431 --> 08:04.763
God, how did we get here?

08:04.765 --> 08:07.099
That's the question
you're left asking yourself.

08:07.101 --> 08:08.751
So here's how
he does it:

08:08.753 --> 08:11.403
First, he makes you
feel like you are

08:11.405 --> 08:12.738
the most hilarious

08:12.740 --> 08:15.057
and adorable person
in the world...

08:15.059 --> 08:16.575
You guys are
hilarious

08:16.577 --> 08:17.776
and adorable!

08:17.778 --> 08:19.394
<i>I like that he gets</i>

08:19.396 --> 08:21.497
<i>how hilarious</i>
<i>and adorable we are.</i>

08:21.499 --> 08:23.833
We are <i>hilarious and adorable.</i>

08:25.369 --> 08:27.569
Next, he finds some flimsy
connection with you

08:27.571 --> 08:28.821
based on where you're from...

08:28.823 --> 08:29.922
Cleveland?
Yeah.

08:29.924 --> 08:31.590
Galluci's serves the

08:31.592 --> 08:32.791
best pepperoni bread!
Best pepperoni bread!

08:32.793 --> 08:34.510
And Staten Island!

08:34.511 --> 08:37.011
Guys getting in fights
on their front lawns!

08:37.014 --> 08:38.847
It's like you're
from there!

08:40.251 --> 08:42.217
<i>This guy's awesome!</i>

08:42.220 --> 08:43.852
<i>So awesome!</i>

08:43.855 --> 08:45.521
I'd totally go to jail for him.

08:45.523 --> 08:48.090
<i>That hurts.</i>

08:48.092 --> 08:51.610
Next, he tells you
a "deep personal secret"

08:51.612 --> 08:53.262
that is usually
the tragic back-story

08:53.264 --> 08:54.563
from an animated kid's film.

08:54.565 --> 08:57.149
My mother died on
a hunting trip.

08:57.151 --> 08:58.651
It's often <i>Bambi.</i>

08:58.653 --> 09:01.070
My father was
betrayed and killed

09:01.072 --> 09:03.072
by a trusted advisor.

09:03.074 --> 09:05.791
Sometimes he'll throw a little
<i>Lion King</i> in there.

09:05.793 --> 09:07.877
I have no family.

09:07.879 --> 09:09.662
But tonight...

09:09.664 --> 09:11.613
I think maybe
I found two brothers.

09:13.284 --> 09:15.384
Sorry, blah, too heavy.

09:15.386 --> 09:16.552
That's okay, man.

09:16.554 --> 09:18.337
Let me get you a drink.

09:18.339 --> 09:20.289
<i>And then, once</i>
<i>your guard is down,</i>

09:20.291 --> 09:23.125
<i>the emotional</i>
<i>prostate exam begins...</i>

09:23.127 --> 09:24.059
So, Ted,

09:24.061 --> 09:26.628
what's going on...
with you?

09:26.630 --> 09:29.765
Well... I mean,
there was this thing...

09:29.767 --> 09:31.133
Never mind.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.568
Hey, hey, hey...

09:32.570 --> 09:34.737
This is me you're talking to.

09:36.823 --> 09:38.473
Look, all I meant

09:38.475 --> 09:40.475
was that there are
two sides here.

09:40.477 --> 09:41.443
Yes,

09:41.445 --> 09:43.279
Italy is your dream,

09:43.281 --> 09:44.813
but being a judge is Marshall's.

09:44.815 --> 09:45.831
Well, that

09:45.833 --> 09:46.865
and teaching prop comedy

09:46.867 --> 09:47.866
to a tropical bird.

09:47.868 --> 09:50.452
Parrot Top has nothing
to do with this!

09:50.454 --> 09:52.371
I don't need
objectivity.

09:52.373 --> 09:55.374
You're my best friend,
I just need your support.

09:55.376 --> 09:57.042
I understand.
You got it.

09:57.044 --> 09:58.427
I'm sorry.

09:58.429 --> 09:59.494
Oh, me, too.

09:59.496 --> 10:00.846
Forgot my phone.

10:00.848 --> 10:02.998
I'm sorry, you guys are probably
talking wedding details.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.850
I mean, no maid of honor's
gonna steal the spotlight

10:04.852 --> 10:06.018
with her own problem

10:06.020 --> 10:07.303
on the bride's big weekend,
am I right?

10:07.305 --> 10:09.021
Keep it real, homies!

10:12.275 --> 10:13.275
You know, he is right.

10:13.277 --> 10:15.110
Why is this all about you?

10:15.112 --> 10:16.395
I mean, you have
been preoccupied

10:16.397 --> 10:17.646
with Marshall all weekend.

10:17.648 --> 10:18.948
I have not!

10:18.950 --> 10:21.016
You have been sleeping
with a doll made of cushions

10:21.018 --> 10:22.351
that you named after him.

10:22.353 --> 10:23.685
Not true!

10:23.687 --> 10:24.737
After we do our business,

10:24.739 --> 10:26.405
I make Marshpillow
sleep on the couch!

10:26.407 --> 10:28.690
So there!
Oh, my God, that is so ridiculous!

10:28.692 --> 10:29.842
So, what did Darren
do to you?

10:29.844 --> 10:32.411
Well, a few years ago,
I started this band.

10:32.413 --> 10:33.996
And, you know, it was a goof--

10:33.998 --> 10:37.249
it was just me and a couple
of dorks from business school.

10:37.251 --> 10:39.868
I'm actually embarrassed
to tell you our name.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.337
I had an all-lawyer funk band

10:41.339 --> 10:43.806
called The Funk, The Whole Funk,
And Nothing But The Funk.

10:43.808 --> 10:46.392
Oh, I now feel very safe
talking about <i>my</i> band--

10:46.394 --> 10:47.593
Super-Freak-Onomics.

10:47.595 --> 10:49.478
Nice.
 Anyway,

10:49.480 --> 10:51.981
I brought Darren in
to split lead vocals,

10:51.983 --> 10:53.399
and he took over.

10:53.401 --> 10:55.317
You know, first
he took away my solos,

10:55.319 --> 10:57.019
then I got demoted
to backup vocals,

10:57.021 --> 10:59.271
and now the only time
I use a mic

10:59.273 --> 11:02.074
is after Darren's first
false exit, when I say,

11:02.076 --> 11:04.109
"Do you guys want more Darren?"

11:04.111 --> 11:05.361
And then today,

11:05.363 --> 11:08.280
I found this
ad online.

11:08.282 --> 11:10.732
"Ass player wanted"?

11:10.734 --> 11:11.583
Move your thumb.

11:11.585 --> 11:13.502
Oh, <i>"bass</i> player wanted."

11:13.504 --> 11:16.121
Wait, he was gonna kick you
out of your own band?

11:16.123 --> 11:17.456
Yeah.

11:17.458 --> 11:20.542
But instead...I quit.

11:20.544 --> 11:22.577
You quit?! That's it?

11:22.579 --> 11:25.014
But it's your band--
you must be avenged!

11:25.016 --> 11:26.548
Funny you should say that,

11:26.550 --> 11:29.802
because as I was leaving
the hotel, I ran into someone.

11:29.804 --> 11:33.639
You need to steal
this douche monkey's van.

11:33.641 --> 11:36.025
Aldrin Justice, nice!

11:36.027 --> 11:37.926
Your wife is cool.

11:37.928 --> 11:40.029
Oh, the coolest.

11:40.864 --> 11:42.597
Hey, did she, um,
happen to mention

11:42.599 --> 11:44.099
the fact
that I'm sort of ruining

11:44.101 --> 11:45.567
her dream of moving to Italy?

11:45.569 --> 11:48.353
Uh, yeah, that did come up.

11:48.355 --> 11:51.740
You need to steal
this douche monkey's van.

11:52.325 --> 11:53.775
And then run

11:53.777 --> 11:56.045
my husband over with it.

11:56.047 --> 11:58.497
I think you've got
a tough talk coming.

11:58.499 --> 11:59.965
Yeah, well, so do you.

11:59.967 --> 12:01.917
When we get
to the Farhampton Inn,

12:01.919 --> 12:03.785
you're gonna go in there and
you're gonna stand up to Darren.

12:03.787 --> 12:06.422
Oh, come on,
I Aldrin Justiced him.

12:06.424 --> 12:07.956
Yeah, but I bet
you're just gonna give

12:07.958 --> 12:09.758
this van right back to him.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.777
I mean, were you at least
gonna pee in it a little?

12:11.779 --> 12:15.564
I was gonna gas it up
and get it washed.

12:15.566 --> 12:17.266
You're too nice.

12:17.268 --> 12:18.901
I'm the same way.

12:18.903 --> 12:20.769
Sometimes you got
to get in there

12:20.771 --> 12:21.904
and-and stand up for yourself.

12:21.906 --> 12:24.823
I always cave and side
with the other person.

12:24.825 --> 12:26.742
I can't handle confrontation.

12:26.744 --> 12:27.809
Yes, you can.

12:27.811 --> 12:29.278
You make some good points.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.163
Look.

12:31.165 --> 12:34.099
I don't know you, but I can tell
that you're strong.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.502
That's your band.

12:36.504 --> 12:38.871
Don't let Darren steal it away.

12:41.125 --> 12:43.092
No, there's
no defeating the devil.

12:43.094 --> 12:45.660
He's someone else's problem now.

12:46.563 --> 12:48.163
I'm sorry
if I've been

12:48.165 --> 12:49.515
distracted this weekend.

12:49.517 --> 12:51.850
Oh, let's not fight anymore,
okay?

12:51.852 --> 12:54.520
Oh, good, Robin,
you finally told Lily

12:54.522 --> 12:55.888
you feel like she's
abandoning you as a friend

12:55.890 --> 12:56.839
by going to Italy.

12:56.841 --> 12:59.892
Honesty is progress.
Stay gold.

13:00.944 --> 13:02.311
I'm not...

13:02.313 --> 13:03.779
Ooh, Ted.

13:03.781 --> 13:04.781
When you move to Chicago,

13:04.782 --> 13:07.366
you got to try Gazzola's pizza.

13:07.368 --> 13:08.683
Namaste, hermanos.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.624
You're moving to Chicago?

13:16.882 --> 13:19.532
Is that even a real place?

13:19.534 --> 13:21.068
It's a style of pizza.

13:21.070 --> 13:22.869
Ted, you can't live in a pizza.

13:22.871 --> 13:24.921
I got an amazing
job offer there.

13:24.923 --> 13:27.274
Look, Lily knows,
but Marshall and Robin don't.

13:27.276 --> 13:28.608
So please keep it quiet.

13:28.610 --> 13:31.895
You're moving to Chicago?!

13:31.897 --> 13:35.381
He-he's moving to Chicago!

13:35.383 --> 13:36.767
When do you move?

13:36.769 --> 13:39.436
At least tell me it's not
until next year or something.

13:39.438 --> 13:42.405
It's not until...

13:42.407 --> 13:43.556
Monday.

13:43.558 --> 13:45.859
Monday?!

13:45.861 --> 13:49.362
So you are just gonna disappear
the day after my wedding?

13:49.364 --> 13:52.165
After ten years
of being best friends?

13:52.167 --> 13:53.769
Well, actually, Marshall's my...
Don't even think about it!

13:53.770 --> 13:54.559
That's fair enough.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.782
You are gonna give me
one day's notice?

13:57.256 --> 14:00.073
Well, I didn't want to upset you
on your wedding weekend.

14:00.075 --> 14:01.458
No, it's good.

14:01.460 --> 14:02.592
It'll be easy to say good-bye

14:02.594 --> 14:04.511
now that I know how much
I mean to you.

14:04.513 --> 14:06.930
Well...

14:10.853 --> 14:12.435
Hey.

14:12.437 --> 14:14.304
Hey.

14:14.306 --> 14:15.722
Look, I was...

14:15.724 --> 14:18.058
I was never really
rooting for Marshall.

14:18.060 --> 14:21.144
I was rooting
to not lose my best friend.

14:22.146 --> 14:23.930
But that's selfish.

14:23.932 --> 14:25.565
No matter where you go,

14:25.567 --> 14:27.818
I'm in your corner
and I always will be.

14:28.569 --> 14:29.820
And to prove it...

14:35.042 --> 14:36.442
What are you gonna do
with Marshpillow?

14:36.444 --> 14:37.627
Hold his arms back

14:37.629 --> 14:40.113
while you beat the goose down
out of this bastard.

14:40.115 --> 14:42.799
Because that's
what best friends do.

14:42.801 --> 14:44.668
Thanks, it-it's not gonna help.

14:44.670 --> 14:46.253
Try it. One punch.

14:49.423 --> 14:51.641
Ooh, that felt good.

14:51.643 --> 14:52.843
Mm-hmm.

14:52.845 --> 14:54.127
Yeah, that's it, sweetheart.

14:54.129 --> 14:57.630
Head, body, head.
Head, body, head.

15:00.017 --> 15:01.985
Barney, wait, wait!

15:01.987 --> 15:03.403
Your friendship is
important to me.

15:03.405 --> 15:04.938
I swear on my mother's...

15:04.940 --> 15:06.306
No, I swear to God.

15:06.308 --> 15:08.074
No... I swear to Hef.

15:08.076 --> 15:10.493
Don't take that name in vain.

15:10.495 --> 15:14.281
If someone is important to you,
you tell them you're moving.

15:14.283 --> 15:17.751
I'm just some guy you
used to know back in New York.

15:17.753 --> 15:19.502
Hey.

15:22.290 --> 15:23.790
Whoa.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.292
How...?

15:32.550 --> 15:35.135
That's a $600 bottle.

15:35.137 --> 15:37.337
Ted, that's grand larceny.

15:37.339 --> 15:39.306
You really could go
to jail for this.

15:39.308 --> 15:42.392
That's the dream.

15:42.394 --> 15:44.895
So...

15:44.897 --> 15:46.663
you're moving to Chicago.

15:46.665 --> 15:49.182
I'm going to Chicago.

15:49.184 --> 15:50.984
Why? I know
Marshall and Lily might leave,

15:50.986 --> 15:52.852
but it's only a year,
and in the meantime,

15:52.854 --> 15:54.537
we'll still see each other
all the time.

15:54.539 --> 15:55.906
You, me, Robin...

15:58.242 --> 16:00.460
Oh.

16:02.696 --> 16:04.881
I need a new start.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.368
I'm gonna miss you.

16:08.370 --> 16:10.387
I'm gonna miss you so much.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.092
Well, here we are.

16:16.094 --> 16:17.227
Good luck in there.

16:17.229 --> 16:18.428
Thank you.

16:18.430 --> 16:20.046
And don't worry,

16:20.048 --> 16:21.348
at the reception, I'll yell,

16:21.350 --> 16:23.600
"The lead singer
sucks skunk junk,"

16:23.602 --> 16:24.901
after every song.

16:25.938 --> 16:26.886
I'll come up with something

16:26.888 --> 16:28.521
better than "skunk junk."

16:28.523 --> 16:29.489
No, no.

16:29.491 --> 16:31.875
"Skunk junk" is pretty solid.

16:33.327 --> 16:36.246
You can't yell that
at the lead singer.

16:36.248 --> 16:39.582
Because I don't suck skunk junk.

16:39.584 --> 16:41.284
Wait, are you saying...?

16:41.286 --> 16:43.787
I'm coming in. Darren and I
are gonna have a chat

16:43.789 --> 16:45.672
about <i>my</i> band!

16:47.125 --> 16:49.376
Skunk junk.

16:51.462 --> 16:55.432
For the record...
Uh-huh.

16:55.434 --> 16:57.384
his first word

16:57.386 --> 16:59.135
was "Mommy."

16:59.137 --> 17:00.337
Mm-hmm.

17:00.339 --> 17:03.189
This is my band. I started it.

17:03.191 --> 17:06.977
And if anyone is getting
fired here, it's you, Darren.

17:06.979 --> 17:08.444
So hit the bricks,

17:08.446 --> 17:10.195
s-skunk...

17:10.198 --> 17:12.031
junk.

17:12.034 --> 17:14.384
Is that even
a little bit intimidating?

17:14.386 --> 17:16.703
Nope, and the
knitting's not helping.

17:16.704 --> 17:19.705
I'm sorry, I just met this baby
and he needs a hat.

17:19.708 --> 17:21.708
What...
You can't fire Darren.

17:21.710 --> 17:24.711
He gets how hilarious
and adorable I am.

17:24.713 --> 17:27.079
Plus it is so inspiring

17:27.082 --> 17:30.834
how he overcame his mother
being eaten by a barracuda.

17:30.836 --> 17:32.886
Gah! It's <i>Finding Nemo.</i>

17:34.189 --> 17:35.472
That's new.

17:36.557 --> 17:39.392
There's no defeating the devil.

17:39.394 --> 17:41.461
New plan.
Linus, if at any point

17:41.463 --> 17:43.463
tonight you see me
with an empty glass...

17:43.465 --> 17:44.630
Kennedy package.

17:44.632 --> 17:46.349
It very popular choice
this weekend.

17:46.351 --> 17:48.234
Thank you, Linus.

17:48.236 --> 17:50.470
Yup.

17:51.522 --> 17:54.240
Uh, Lily?

17:54.242 --> 17:56.309
Lily.

17:56.311 --> 17:57.911

Pause?

18:12.010 --> 18:14.344
Pause.

18:17.048 --> 18:19.265
Hi.

18:24.138 --> 18:25.505
Thank you, Linus.

18:25.507 --> 18:27.390
Mm-hmm.

18:27.392 --> 18:30.009
There are real villains
in this world.

18:30.011 --> 18:33.947
But they don't always get
real justice, do they?

18:33.949 --> 18:36.583
You want to believe
karma's gonna get them.

18:36.585 --> 18:38.017
All right, who wants a drink?

18:38.019 --> 18:39.069
I'm stealing.

18:41.022 --> 18:43.623
But karma doesn't

18:43.625 --> 18:45.208
always come through.

18:45.210 --> 18:47.077
I love how strong
your marriage is.

18:47.079 --> 18:48.578
And you don't need
to lose weight, Louise,

18:48.580 --> 18:50.196
no matter what he told me.

18:50.198 --> 18:52.298
Catch you on the flip-flop,
muchachos.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.167
Oh!

18:55.337 --> 18:57.170
Sorry, <i>mi amigos.</i>

18:57.172 --> 19:00.540
I guess you have to accept
that sometimes in life...

19:01.759 --> 19:04.010
...you just don't get that
knockout punch.

19:12.437 --> 19:13.886
Hey, can I get some ice?

19:13.888 --> 19:16.573
The best man just punched me
in the face for no reason.

19:17.559 --> 19:19.526
Oh, what, that's funny to you?

19:19.528 --> 19:20.726
You know what? I quit.

19:20.728 --> 19:22.545
You can have
your stupid band back.

19:22.547 --> 19:26.616
I miss being in a band where
people are decent to each other

19:26.618 --> 19:28.168
and there's no drama.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.420
I'm going back
to the new Guns N' Roses.

19:32.790 --> 19:34.740
Linus, whoever that best man is,

19:34.742 --> 19:38.011
I would like to buy him a double
of your finest scotch.

What is this?

20:05.773 --> 20:07.940
It's the Glen McKenna 35-year.

20:07.942 --> 20:09.909
Wait a minute.

20:09.911 --> 20:12.278
This whole time, you had
Glen McKenna 35-year?

20:12.280 --> 20:13.713
Why didn't you say something?

20:13.715 --> 20:15.448
You didn't ask about the 35.

20:15.450 --> 20:17.782

Hey, Barney, I'm so sorry
I missed your rehearsal dinner.

20:28.858 --> 20:30.424
Oh, that's okay.

20:30.426 --> 20:33.861
We didn't even know
you weren't here, jerk.

20:33.863 --> 20:35.780
Listen, I know that I can't
make up for being late,

20:35.782 --> 20:37.732
but I did get you
a-a special gift.

20:37.734 --> 20:39.651
Well, hand it over, fathead.

20:39.653 --> 20:41.703
Well, you might want to wait
until after the wedding photos.

20:41.705 --> 20:44.322
Hand it over now, travel breath.

20:44.324 --> 20:46.574
Okay, Barney, I'll hand it over.

20:47.442 --> 20:48.793
Oh, God, it's the fourth slap!

20:48.795 --> 20:50.411
I don't know why
I was so obnoxious.
