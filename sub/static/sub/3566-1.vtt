<i>My</i> name is Max.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.279
<i>My world is fire and blood.</i>

00:26.151 --> 00:27.698
<i>Why are you hurting these people?</i>

00:27.945 --> 00:29.288
<i>It's the oil, stupid.</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:31.999
<i>- Oil wars.
- We are killing for guzzoline.</i>

00:32.241 --> 00:33.914
<i>The world is running out of water.</i>

00:34.159 --> 00:35.911
<i>Now there's the water wars.</i>

00:37.621 --> 00:39.999
<i>Once, I was a cop.</i>

00:40.249 --> 00:42.798
<i>A road warrior searching
for a righteous cause.</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:44.636
<i>to the terminal freak-out point.</i>

00:44.878 --> 00:47.973
<i>MAN B".
Mankind has gone rogue, terrorizing itself.</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:49.558
<i>Thermonuclear skirmish.</i>

00:49.800 --> 00:50.972
<i>The earth is sour.</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:52.470
<i>Our bones are poisoned.</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:54.687
<i>We have become half-life.</i>

00:55.722 --> 00:57.565
<i>As the world fell...</i>

00:57.808 --> 01:00.732
<i>...each of us, in our own way,
was broken.</i>

01:01.270 --> 01:04.444
<i>It was hard to know
who was more crazy:</i>

01:06.400 --> 01:07.617
<i>Me...</i>

01:07.985 --> 01:09.737
. . . <i>or everyone else.</i>

01:12.406 --> 01:13.578
<i>Hello?</i>

01:16.159 --> 01:17.627
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:25.043 --> 01:26.169
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

01:26.420 --> 01:28.388
<i>- MAX". Here they come again.
- Max Rockatansky.</i>

01:28.630 --> 01:31.804
<i>Worming their way
into the black matter of my brain.</i>

01:32.050 --> 01:34.052
<i>- Help us, Max.</i>
<i>- You promised to help us.</i>

01:38.348 --> 01:40.225
<i>I tell myself“...</i>

01:40.475 --> 01:42.569
<i>...they cannot touch me.</i>

01:44.438 --> 01:46.236
<i>They are long dead.</i>

02:44.122 --> 02:45.169
<i>MAX".
I am the one...</i>

02:45.415 --> 02:48.510
<i>...who runs from both
the living and the dead.</i>

02:49.628 --> 02:51.926
<i>Hunted by scavengers.</i>

02:52.631 --> 02:55.475
<i>Haunted by those I could not protect.</i>

03:04.851 --> 03:07.354
<i>MAX".
S0 I exist in this wasteland.</i>

03:12.401 --> 03:16.406
<i>A man reduced to a single instinct:</i>

03:17.155 --> 03:18.577
<i>Survive.</i>

04:39.070 --> 04:39.866
“Flax?

04:40.113 --> 04:40.989
Is that you?

04:42.157 --> 04:42.999
Where were you?

04:45.160 --> 04:47.083
Help us. Where were you?

04:47.329 --> 04:48.125
Where were you, Max?

05:05.096 --> 05:06.097
Where were you, Max?

05:06.723 --> 05:07.349
Stop running.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.522
You let us die!

05:11.061 --> 05:12.438
You let us die!

05:12.687 --> 05:13.904
You let us die!

05:14.773 --> 05:15.695
You promised to help us!

05:15.941 --> 05:16.737
Why?

05:35.919 --> 05:37.171
Witness!

05:39.297 --> 05:40.594
I got him.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.813
We are War Boys!

06:32.058 --> 06:32.980
War Boys!

06:33.226 --> 06:35.069
Kamakrazee War Boys!

06:35.312 --> 06:36.108
War Boys!

06:36.354 --> 06:38.482
Fucacima kamakrazee...

06:38.732 --> 06:40.029
...War Boys!

06:40.275 --> 06:42.243
Hooked on!

06:43.028 --> 06:43.904
Today we're heading...

06:44.154 --> 06:45.497
...to Gas Town!

06:45.739 --> 06:47.082
Gas Town!

06:47.324 --> 06:49.326
Today we're hauling Aqua Cola.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.370
Aqua Cola!

06:51.786 --> 06:54.414
- Today we're hauling produce!
- Produce!

06:54.831 --> 06:56.083
And today we're hauling...

06:56.333 --> 06:57.550
...Mother's Milk!

06:57.792 --> 06:59.294
Mother's Milk!

07:24.027 --> 07:27.497
<i>Joe! Joe! Joe! lmmortan Joe!</i>

07:48.176 --> 07:50.395
Rev it up for the lmmortan Joe!

07:59.646 --> 08:03.651
Once again, we send off my War Rig
to bring back...

08:03.900 --> 08:06.244
...guzzoline from Gas Town...

08:06.486 --> 08:09.239
...and bullets from the Bullet Farm!

08:09.781 --> 08:13.456
Once again, I salute my lmperator...

08:13.702 --> 08:15.329
...Furiosa!

08:15.578 --> 08:16.500
And I salute...

08:16.746 --> 08:19.374
...my half-life War Boys...

08:19.624 --> 08:21.968
...who will ride with me eternal...

08:22.252 --> 08:24.596
...on the highways of Valhalla.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.216
<i>V8! V8! V8! V8!</i>

08:27.465 --> 08:30.093
I am your redeemer.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.687
It is by my hand...

08:32.929 --> 08:35.977
...you will rise from the ashes...

08:36.224 --> 08:37.191
...of this world!

08:45.567 --> 08:47.820
It's coming. Get ready.

08:48.069 --> 08:52.040
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's coming.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.719
Do not, my friends...

09:50.965 --> 09:53.093
...become addicted to water.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.936
It will take hold of you...

09:55.261 --> 09:58.140
...and you will resent its absence.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.507
Clear off!

10:26.167 --> 10:28.090
Get them all off!

10:28.628 --> 10:29.629
Clear off!

10:29.879 --> 10:31.677
Get them all off.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.763
Get off!

10:39.222 --> 10:42.192
Signal Gas Town. Convoy's on its way.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.377
I got a War Boy...

11:09.627 --> 11:11.379
...running on empty.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.681
Hook up that full-life.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.934
Hey! Careful. That's a universal donor.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.539
Boss, we're not going to Gas Town?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.459
Bullet Farm?

12:25.828 --> 12:27.501
We're heading east.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.251
I'll pass it down the line.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.382
New orders!

12:33.628 --> 12:35.301
Thunder up! Thunder up!

12:35.713 --> 12:37.010
This is not a supply run!

12:38.007 --> 12:38.974
Go. Go.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.766
- Ace, what's going on?
-Go. We're heading east.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.389
- Why?
-I don't know. That's the order.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.033
Moo.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.330
- Hey, Pa.
- Hmm?

13:04.575 --> 13:06.122
You know about this?

13:06.953 --> 13:09.547
Your produce ain't going to Gas Town.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.016
She's gone off-road...

13:21.426 --> 13:23.303
...into hostile territory.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.563
Why would she do that?

13:28.850 --> 13:29.476
Let me see.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.443
Rictus.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.153
- I wanna see.
-Rictus.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.648
Go see what's agitating Dad.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.226
Splendid!

14:05.386 --> 14:07.104
Angharad!

14:16.606 --> 14:17.573
Where are they?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.658
They are not your property.

14:19.901 --> 14:20.697
Miss Giddy?

14:21.110 --> 14:22.703
You cannot own a human being.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.161
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

14:26.407 --> 14:28.501
Where is she taking them?

14:28.743 --> 14:30.962
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go!

14:33.039 --> 14:34.507
Where is she taking them?

14:34.749 --> 14:36.547
A long way from you.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.029
Hey. Hey, what's happening?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.327
Slit!

15:07.990 --> 15:09.492
What's going on? Slit!

15:09.742 --> 15:12.461
Treason. Betrayal.
An lmperator gone rogue.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.374
An lmperator.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.213
Who?

15:14.455 --> 15:17.299
Furiosa! She took a lot of stuff
from lmmortan Joe.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.384
What stuff?

15:18.835 --> 15:20.758
Breeders! His prize breeders!

15:21.003 --> 15:23.506
He wants them back!
Not a hand laid on them.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.398
By my deeds I honor him.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.732
V8.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.313
<i>V8! V8! V8!</i>

15:45.736 --> 15:46.487
That's my wheel.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.533
I'm driving.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.747
You're my lancer.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.367
I just promoted myself.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.160
Not today. Today is my day.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.206
Look at you.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.296
If you can't stand up,
you can't do war.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.790
He's right, son.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.212
I'm not staying here dying soft.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.968
You're already a corpse.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.383
- I just need a top-up. More juice.
-No time!

16:04.130 --> 16:05.177
We take my Blood Bag.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.642
We take my Blood Bag
and strap him to the lancer's perch.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.431
It's got a muzzle on it. It's feral.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.269
That's right.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.730
High-octane crazy blood
filling me up.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.686
If I'm gonna die...

16:20.104 --> 16:22.106
...I'm gonna die historic
on the Fury Road.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.536
Yeah. Yeah.

16:30.781 --> 16:34.035
- Organic, hitch up his Blood Bag.
- Eh?

16:34.452 --> 16:35.499
Right-o.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.178
How much more can they take from me?

16:47.423 --> 16:49.642
They've got my blood. Now it's my car!

17:27.713 --> 17:28.714
Immortan!

17:30.091 --> 17:31.593
Immortan Joe!

17:34.512 --> 17:35.934
He looked at me!

17:36.556 --> 17:39.435
- He looked right at me!
-He looked at your Blood Bag!

17:39.684 --> 17:41.982
He turned his head.
He looked me in the eye.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.401
He was scanning the horizon.

17:44.814 --> 17:45.906
No.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.324
I am awaited.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.952
I am awaited in Valhalla!

17:52.446 --> 17:54.540
<i>Confucamus!</i>

17:56.951 --> 17:57.998
lmmortan!

17:59.370 --> 18:00.872
Yeah!

18:20.224 --> 18:22.022
Hey! Heads up!

18:22.268 --> 18:23.235
Heads up!

18:28.107 --> 18:29.108
<i>Boss'.!</i>

18:30.067 --> 18:31.068
We got vehicles from the Citadel.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.612
They're firing flares.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.363
They want reinforcements
from Gas Town...

18:34.614 --> 18:36.207
...and the Bullet Farm.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.200
What is this?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.793
Backup? Decoy?

18:40.161 --> 18:41.708
It's a detour.

19:13.861 --> 19:14.862
Eyes right!

19:18.199 --> 19:19.291
Buzzards!

19:19.533 --> 19:22.457
- Buzzards right! Eyes on! Eyes on!
-Buzzards right!

19:22.703 --> 19:23.795
- Eyes on!
- Eyes on!

19:26.540 --> 19:29.635
Should we turn it around
and run them into our backup?

19:31.295 --> 19:32.842
No! We're good!

19:33.798 --> 19:35.050
We fang it!

19:38.469 --> 19:40.517
Thunder up! Here we go!

19:43.641 --> 19:45.439
Prepare the gunners!

20:14.880 --> 20:15.381
Morsov!

20:19.051 --> 20:20.018
Come on, attack!

20:32.898 --> 20:33.615
War!

20:42.408 --> 20:43.705
Ready!

21:27.828 --> 21:29.375
She's ours, Slit!

21:29.622 --> 21:30.248
She's ours.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.921
First, we get the Buzzards off her back!

21:39.006 --> 21:39.632
Form up!

21:44.094 --> 21:45.186
That's my head!

22:20.506 --> 22:22.554
Get up! You can do it!

22:27.721 --> 22:28.813
Morsov!

22:30.266 --> 22:32.360
- Morsov!
- No!

22:32.601 --> 22:34.319
- Witness me!
- Witness!

22:34.562 --> 22:35.404
Witness!

22:35.855 --> 22:36.731
Aah!

22:40.985 --> 22:42.077
Fly!

22:46.657 --> 22:47.374
Witness!

22:47.616 --> 22:48.333
Witness!

22:49.994 --> 22:51.996
Mediocre, Morsov!

22:52.246 --> 22:54.465
- Mediocre!
-Hoorah!

23:16.979 --> 23:17.605
Aah!

23:25.154 --> 23:25.950
Get ready!

23:27.865 --> 23:28.866
Back me in!

23:33.162 --> 23:34.254
They're coming!

23:51.972 --> 23:53.974
We can't breathe down there!

23:54.224 --> 23:55.100
Stay out of sight!

23:56.185 --> 23:56.811
Now!

24:00.397 --> 24:01.444
Aah!

24:09.490 --> 24:10.491
Go back!

24:11.825 --> 24:12.417
Where's he going?

24:12.660 --> 24:13.252
Hydraulics!

24:13.494 --> 24:14.461
Hydraulics!

24:18.332 --> 24:19.174
Aah!

24:36.684 --> 24:37.810
Yeah.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.159
Now we bring home the booty.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.683
She thinks she can lose us, Dad.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.772
She thinks we're stupid.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.393
She thinks she can lose us in there!

25:37.161 --> 25:38.037
Fang it!

25:38.746 --> 25:40.043
Fang it!

25:46.128 --> 25:47.129
Why can't you stop?

25:49.089 --> 25:50.136
Crew! Out of the way!

25:50.382 --> 25:51.099
Out of the way!

25:51.341 --> 25:52.558
What have you done?

25:52.801 --> 25:53.927
What have you done?

25:57.806 --> 25:58.398
Yeah.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.998
We need counterweight.
Get the Blood Bag down the back.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.515
Hunt them down! Hunt them down!

26:57.449 --> 26:58.325
Hey. head!

26:58.575 --> 26:59.747
Say bye-bye to the neck!

27:01.203 --> 27:01.874
We're going in!

28:04.766 --> 28:07.360
Come on! We've almost got her!

28:15.819 --> 28:17.492
Come on! Hold it steady!

28:45.641 --> 28:46.312
Oh, what a day!

28:46.558 --> 28:48.310
What a lovely day!

29:07.955 --> 29:08.547
lam the man...

29:09.915 --> 29:11.132
...who grabs the sun...

29:13.961 --> 29:15.679
...riding to Valhalla!

29:18.548 --> 29:19.140
Witness me...

29:19.383 --> 29:20.179
...Blood Bag!

29:24.429 --> 29:25.851
Witness!

29:49.830 --> 29:52.003
I live, I die, I live again!

29:58.588 --> 29:59.589
Aah!

33:35.055 --> 33:36.477
We're not going back.

34:05.335 --> 34:05.961
Water.

34:59.014 --> 34:59.640
Ah.

35:02.183 --> 35:02.809
You.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.710
Angharad, is that just the wind...

35:21.369 --> 35:23.121
...or is that a furious vexation?

36:25.058 --> 36:26.685
Ugh!

36:52.836 --> 36:54.053
I got it!

37:04.222 --> 37:05.690
Aah!

37:35.462 --> 37:38.432
Glory me, Blood Bag!
We snagged her alive.

37:38.673 --> 37:41.017
He's gonna shred her. Shred her.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.602
Bolt cutters.

37:43.178 --> 37:44.270
Chain.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.098
Hey, hey!

37:50.685 --> 37:52.403
Oh, look at them.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.232
So shiny. So chrome.

37:55.690 --> 37:56.942
He's gonna be so grateful.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.406
We could ask for anything.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.239
I wanna drive the War Rig.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.458
- What are you gonna ask for?
-That's my jacket.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.418
Heh, heh. Sure.

38:08.077 --> 38:11.251
- You can ask for more than a jacket.
-We're going to the Green Place.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.216
Wait, it's you and me. Ugh!

38:26.846 --> 38:29.315
We're going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.460
How does it feel?

38:49.702 --> 38:51.875
- It hurts.
-Out here, everything hurts.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.505
You wanna get through this?

39:00.213 --> 39:01.214
Do as I say.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.471
Now pick up what you can and run.

39:15.270 --> 39:16.271
Tsa!

39:51.055 --> 39:52.477
Kill switches.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.651
I set the sequence myself.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.817
This Rig goes nowhere without me.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.946
You can get in.

40:04.319 --> 40:05.741
Not without them.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.334
So we wait.

40:24.213 --> 40:26.682
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.895
You've damaged one of his wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

40:37.018 --> 40:40.192
You're sitting on 2000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine.

40:41.147 --> 40:43.525
I'd say you got
about a five-minute head start.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.334
You want that thing off your face?

41:06.172 --> 41:07.219
Let's go.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.156
Ah, uh-uh.

41:51.718 --> 41:55.268
Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite.

42:15.950 --> 42:16.951
Smeg!

42:37.430 --> 42:38.977
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.521
- What choice does she have?
- He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

42:41.768 --> 42:42.690
- Why?
-To bargain.

42:42.935 --> 42:43.936
Oh, he'll hurt us.

42:44.187 --> 42:45.939
Think he's coming to the Green Place?

42:46.189 --> 42:47.236
Never! He's a crazy smeg...

42:47.482 --> 42:49.109
...who eats schlanger!

43:15.843 --> 43:16.935
Nah, stay out of there.

43:17.178 --> 43:18.270
Behind you.

43:18.679 --> 43:20.022
Huh?

43:23.101 --> 43:24.569
The Gas Town Boys.

43:26.354 --> 43:28.197
Don't damage the goods.

43:34.695 --> 43:36.117
What do you see?

43:38.449 --> 43:39.871
Big Rigs...

43:41.577 --> 43:42.954
...Polecats...

43:43.663 --> 43:44.755
...Flamers...

43:46.582 --> 43:49.176
...and there's the People Eater himself.

43:50.294 --> 43:52.296
Coming to count the cost.

43:52.547 --> 43:53.514
Hmm.

44:04.725 --> 44:06.477
Aah!

44:08.396 --> 44:10.569
We're dragging something out back.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.158
I think it's the fuel pod.

44:13.025 --> 44:13.867
No, no.

44:15.403 --> 44:16.120
I'll go.

45:40.321 --> 45:41.823
- Filth! You traitored him!
- Ah!

45:46.661 --> 45:47.913
No unnecessary killing!

45:48.162 --> 45:49.960
- This War Boy wants me dead!
-We agreed!

45:50.623 --> 45:52.500
He's kamakrazee!

45:52.959 --> 45:54.961
He's just a kid
at the end of his half-life!

45:55.211 --> 45:57.259
No! I live. I die. I live again!

45:58.005 --> 45:59.552
- Hold him!
- Tie him up!

45:59.799 --> 46:00.675
Throw him out!

46:01.133 --> 46:02.259
Chuck him out!

46:03.386 --> 46:05.059
You got more friends.

46:07.390 --> 46:08.812
Bullet Farmer.

46:09.058 --> 46:11.231
- They're coming from the Bullet Farm.
-Yeah?

46:12.353 --> 46:14.151
It's over. You can't defy him.

46:14.522 --> 46:15.398
Just watch us, mate!

46:15.648 --> 46:16.444
He is the one...

46:16.691 --> 46:18.819
- ...who grabbed the sun.
- Look how slick he's fooled you.

46:19.068 --> 46:20.615
- He's a lying old man.
- By his hand...

46:20.861 --> 46:22.704
- ...we'll be lifted up!
- That's why we have...

46:22.947 --> 46:24.494
...his logo seared on our backs!

46:24.740 --> 46:26.367
"Breeding Stock!" "Battle Fodder!"

46:26.617 --> 46:27.539
No, I am awaited!

46:27.785 --> 46:30.083
- You're an old man's "Battle Fodder"!
- Killing everyone...

46:30.329 --> 46:31.706
- ...and everything.
- We're not to blame!

46:32.456 --> 46:33.799
Then who killed the world?

47:01.944 --> 47:03.912
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.491
I don't know if it's still any good.

47:07.325 --> 47:08.372
Get back in the hold!

47:08.617 --> 47:10.164
Keep the hatch open.

47:17.376 --> 47:18.423
I need you here.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.298
You may have to drive the Rig.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.093
Mm.

47:27.803 --> 47:28.474
You.

47:29.889 --> 47:30.936
You stay.

47:32.141 --> 47:33.233
You stay there.

47:36.812 --> 47:39.190
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.238
I'm supposed to be alone.

47:41.484 --> 47:42.986
That was the deal.

47:49.617 --> 47:50.789
Down here.

48:11.680 --> 48:12.522
Hey.

48:13.641 --> 48:14.813
What's your name?

48:16.685 --> 48:17.686
What do I call you?

48:19.146 --> 48:20.272
Does it matter?

48:22.691 --> 48:23.738
Fine.

48:24.276 --> 48:25.368
When I yell "fool"...

48:25.611 --> 48:27.909
...you drive out of here
as fast <i>as</i> you can.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.037
This is the sequence:

48:31.867 --> 48:33.494
One. One, two.

48:33.744 --> 48:34.791
One.

48:35.454 --> 48:37.877
Red. Black. Go.

48:38.582 --> 48:39.799
You have it?

50:05.336 --> 50:06.758
It's all here!

50:08.005 --> 50:10.975
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline,
just like you asked!

50:15.012 --> 50:16.730
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.226
You drop the rocks.

50:28.859 --> 50:30.156
You said:

50:30.402 --> 50:31.870
"A few vehicles in pursuit.

50:32.363 --> 50:33.580
Maybe."

50:33.906 --> 50:35.032
We count three War Parties!

50:37.117 --> 50:38.790
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.

50:39.370 --> 50:40.747
Let's do this!

51:07.690 --> 51:08.407
Fool!

51:49.440 --> 51:50.783
That's our fuel!

52:05.539 --> 52:07.507
Make way for the Ripsaw!

52:11.795 --> 52:12.967
Come on! Move them!

52:22.681 --> 52:23.807
Once I'm over...

52:24.058 --> 52:26.277
...clear the rocks
and bring everyone through.

52:26.518 --> 52:27.485
lmmortan!

52:28.270 --> 52:29.772
Immortan Joe!

52:30.022 --> 52:33.276
I got a War Boy!
Says he was on the War Rig.

52:35.694 --> 52:37.571
You! Climb aboard!

52:39.698 --> 52:41.075
Hey. Hey!

52:42.076 --> 52:43.293
I got his boot!

52:43.535 --> 52:45.537
I got the Blood Bag's boot!

52:46.038 --> 52:47.460
Take me!

52:47.831 --> 52:49.299
I got his boot!

52:51.418 --> 52:53.921
All this for a family squabble.

52:54.672 --> 52:56.595
Healthy babies.

54:52.289 --> 54:52.881
Aah!

55:04.885 --> 55:05.852
Reload the clip.

55:06.512 --> 55:07.229
I can't.

55:14.436 --> 55:15.107
Gun!

55:16.939 --> 55:17.610
Gimme the gun!

55:17.856 --> 55:18.448
Not loaded yet!

55:18.690 --> 55:19.316
Now!

55:19.566 --> 55:20.158
We had a deal!

55:22.653 --> 55:23.324
Ugh!

56:09.408 --> 56:10.625
Rictus!

56:11.076 --> 56:12.123
The wives!

56:12.369 --> 56:13.712
No more flames.

56:20.377 --> 56:21.720
Splendid!

56:22.212 --> 56:23.338
Splendid!

56:23.589 --> 56:24.465
That's my child!

56:26.174 --> 56:27.096
My property!

56:29.177 --> 56:30.019
Immorta--

56:39.730 --> 56:43.610
lmmortan. If I get on the Rig,
there's a way inside.

56:43.859 --> 56:45.827
- What is your name?
-lt's Nux.

56:46.194 --> 56:48.492
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing.

56:48.739 --> 56:49.706
No.

56:49.948 --> 56:51.575
Put a bullet in her skull.

56:51.825 --> 56:54.544
Stop the Rig,
return my treasures to me...

56:54.912 --> 56:57.210
...and I, myself, will carry you...

56:57.831 --> 56:58.923
...to the Gates...

56:59.166 --> 57:00.418
...of Valhalla.

57:01.043 --> 57:02.169
Am I awaited?

57:03.045 --> 57:04.467
You will ride eternal...

57:04.922 --> 57:07.016
...shiny and chrome.

57:08.550 --> 57:09.722
Rictus!

57:10.469 --> 57:12.062
Help him aboard!

57:14.222 --> 57:14.814
Ready?

57:15.474 --> 57:16.691
Here we go!

57:25.108 --> 57:26.485
Aah!

57:28.570 --> 57:29.241
Mediocre!

58:00.102 --> 58:01.103
Schlanger!

58:22.040 --> 58:23.542
Look out!

58:25.836 --> 58:26.553
Angharad!

58:27.546 --> 58:28.263
Get out!

58:50.027 --> 58:50.823
No!

58:51.361 --> 58:51.987
Angharad!

59:06.835 --> 59:09.088
Stop! Turn the Rig around!

59:10.047 --> 59:11.515
Go back for her!

59:12.841 --> 59:13.763
No.

59:14.009 --> 59:15.511
Tell him to turn the Rig around!

59:15.761 --> 59:16.808
Did you see it?

59:17.345 --> 59:19.268
She went under the wheels.

59:19.514 --> 59:20.891
Did you see it?

59:22.559 --> 59:24.277
She went under the wheels.

59:25.479 --> 59:26.651
We keep moving.

59:26.897 --> 59:27.944
- No!
- We keep moving!

59:28.190 --> 59:30.818
He doesn't know what he's talking about!

59:31.068 --> 59:33.070
Whatever happens,
we're going to the Green Place.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.698
The stupid Green Place.
We don't even know where to find it!

59:48.335 --> 59:50.804
- You all right?
-On! On!

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.051
Cheedo!

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:31.966
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:32.963
Stop!

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:34.760
He'll forgive us. I know he will.

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.178
There is no going back!

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:38.097
- We were his treasures!
- Cheedo!

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.229
We were protected! He gave us the high life!

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:44.224
- What's wrong with that?
- We are not things.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:45.225
No!

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:47.644
We are not things!

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.146
We are not things.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:52.320
- I don't want to hear that again!
-They were her words!

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:53.738
And now she's dead!

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:56.278
Wring your hands and tear your hair...

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:57.996
...but you're not going back.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:00.244
You're not going back to him.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.412
Angharad!

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.535
Come on! Come on!

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:23.268
So, um, ahem...

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:25.144
...where is this...

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.227
...Green Place?

01:01:29.311 --> 01:01:31.484
It's a long night's run, heading east.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.116
We need inventory.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.735
Match every gun with its bullets.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.412
I'm gonna go and do some repairs.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.080
We need someone down the back.

01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:46.078
I'll go.

01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:47.045
No.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:49.039
I want you to stay together.

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:50.875
I can do it.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.207
What are you doing here?

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:27.877
He saw it.

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:29.875
He saw it all.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:33.792
My own Blood Bag driving the Rig
that killed her.

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:42.766
Stop doing that.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.096
Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:47.438
Stop.

01:02:57.565 --> 01:03:00.364
Three times the gates were open to me.

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:01.653
What gates?

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:04.160
I was awaited in Valhalla.

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:05.991
They were calling my name.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:10.538
I should be walking with the lmmorta.
McFeasting with the heroes of all time.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:16.964
I'd say it was your manifest destiny not to.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.469
I thought I was being spared
for something great.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:25.185
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:29.140
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.187
Who are Larry and Barry?

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:33.310
My mates.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.149
Larry and Barry.

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:39.782
If they don't get me,
then the Night Fevers will.

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:08.099
Well, we've only got four for Big Boy here,
so he's all but useless.

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:10.646
But...

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:14.894
...we can squirt off this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times.

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:19.440
Angharad used to call them Antiseed.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.613
Plant one and watch something die.

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:40.437
Hold on, mate.

01:05:57.871 --> 01:06:01.000
We are down
30,000 units of guzzoline...

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:04.128
...19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes...

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:05.882
...seven pursuit vehicles.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.006
The deficit mounts.

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:09.348
And now, sir...

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:12.556
...you have us stuck in a quagmire.

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:14.266
Hey, Joe!

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.272
<i>Boss'.!</i>

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.527
Your girly's breathing her last!

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.067
What about the child?

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.782
Are you coming, brother?

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:35.124
Wait!

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.960
It's gone awful quiet in there.

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:39.375
Get it out.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:40.873
Get it out!

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.836
Come on! I've been called to the torture!

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:47.587
Patience!

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.883
Oh, you stay here with your grief, Daddy.

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:55.307
<i>-L'll</i> fetch them for you.
- Be careful! Protect the assets!

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.184
Just one angry shot...

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:02.481
...for Furiosa.

01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:03.694
Hut!

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:04.904
Yeah!

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.663
Crying shame. Heh.

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.031
Come.

01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:17.033
Another month...

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:19.835
...could have been your viable human!

01:07:20.078 --> 01:07:21.421
Was it a male?

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:23.256
Your A-1 Alpha prime.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:27.756
Hey, Rictus!

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:30.805
You lost a baby brother!

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:35.010
Perfect in every way.

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:39.351
I had a baby brother!

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:41.732
I had a little baby brother!

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:43.773
And he was perfect!

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:45.895
Perfect in every way!

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:17.760
Come on.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.854
Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.197
Just probing.

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:43.127
He wants to help!

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:44.165
Who?

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:45.755
The War Boy!

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.419
Where did he come from?

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:49.008
I thought we threw him off the Rig!

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:54.505
There's high ground...

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:56.633
...just beyond that thing.
-He means the tree.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.559
Yeah. Tree!

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:00.804
Leave him to me.

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:04.558
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Encroaching gunfire?

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:05.934
Get out.

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:07.310
I can do this. I know this machine.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.153
He does. He's a Revhead.

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:15.734
You've got two left!

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:23.242
On him.

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.478
Don't breathe.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:44.725
Ugh!

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:47.024
Hey!

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:48.609
Hey! Hey!

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:49.852
War Boy!

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:52.697
I'm gonna use the winch
around the tree thing!

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:54.774
Take this.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.742
Let's get the engine plates.

01:09:57.985 --> 01:09:58.952
You drive the Rig!

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.038
- Hold up a flare!
-I am holding a flare!

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:04.201
- Closer!
-lt's right in front of your eyes!

01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:06.210
Aah!

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.264
Hut! Hut!

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:25.854
Blood Bag!

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:34.689
I am the scales of justice!

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:37.525
Conductor of the choir of death!

01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:40.407
Sing, Brother Heckler.

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.664
Sing, Brother Koch!

01:10:46.617 --> 01:10:50.167
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:52.336
Don't they know they're shooting at us?

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:08.560
Gun fever!

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:21.133
I never thought I'd do something
as shine as that.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.139
How are the engines?

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:25.220
Very hot and real thirsty.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:34.101
Hey. You need to take the War Rig
half a klick down the track.

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:38.192
What if you're not back by the time
the engines have cooled?

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.949
Well, you keep moving.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.415
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:56.042
Retaliate first.

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:00.634
Let's go!

01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:23.008
- Are you hurt?
-Huh?

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:24.467
You're bleeding.

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:26.671
That's not his blood.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:29.841
What is this?

01:14:30.758 --> 01:14:31.930
It's Mother's Milk.

01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:15.469
It's okay.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:16.767
Sleep.

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:19.474
Get some rest.

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:32.536
How do you know this place even exists?

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.699
I was born there.

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:40.085
S0 Why'd you leave?

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:41.666
I didn't.

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:45.170
I was taken as a child.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:48.043
Stolen.

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:55.809
You done this before?

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:57.846
Many times.

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:01.144
Now that I drive a War Rig...

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:04.898
...this is the best shot I'll ever have.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:07.150
And them?

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:10.692
They're looking for hope.

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:13.111
What about you?

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:19.871
Redemption.

01:17:03.327 --> 01:17:05.750
Hey, what's that?

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:20.470
I remember something like that.

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:34.278
Help me!

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:38.954
Help me!

01:17:42.449 --> 01:17:43.746
- Help me, please!
-Uh, uh.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.245
Please!

01:17:45.953 --> 01:17:47.079
That's bait.

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:49.916
Stay in the Rig.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:58.050
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:00.308
I am one of...

01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:01.803
...the Vuvalini!

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:04.559
Of the Many Mothers!

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.360
My Initiate Mother was K.T. Concannon!

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:13.193
I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa.

01:18:14.398 --> 01:18:17.242
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

01:19:04.448 --> 01:19:05.745
It's me.

01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:15.543
There's something in the eyes.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.179
Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:24.181
This is our Furiosa.

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:29.098
How long has it been?

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:32.101
Seven thousand days.

01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:34.820
Plus the ones I don't remember.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.277
Furiosa.

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.364
What happened to your mother?

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:43.162
She died.

01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:45.661
On the third day.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:53.922
From where did you come?

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:58.011
The West. Citadel. Beyond the mountains.

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:02.924
The men.

01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:04.345
Who are they?

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:05.934
They're reliable.

01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:08.016
They helped us get here.

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:22.117
Where did you find such creatures?

01:20:24.695 --> 01:20:25.992
So soft.

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:28.119
This one has all her teeth!

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:34.788
Oh.

01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:39.335
I can't wait for them to see it.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.086
See?

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:43.506
See what?

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:45.008
Home.

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:50.513
The Green Place.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.891
But if you came from the West...

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:55.479
...you passed it.

01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:58.278
The crows.

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:01.065
The creepy place with all the crows.

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:03.492
- The soil.
-We had to get out.

01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:05.532
- We had no water.
-The water was filth.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:07.405
It was poisoned. It was sour.

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:09.031
And then the crows came.

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:11.033
We couldn't grow anything.

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:12.626
Where are the others?

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:13.835
What others?

01:21:14.078 --> 01:21:15.250
The Many Mothers.

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:16.998
We're the only ones left.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.059
Look.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.023
That's what you call a satellite.

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:27.026
Miss Giddy told us about those.

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:30.453
They used to bounce messages
across the Earth.

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:32.785
Shows.

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.329
Everyone in the old world
had a show.

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:38.503
Do you think there's still...

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:40.042
<i>"somebody oui there'?</i>

01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:42.795
Sending shows?

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:44.426
Who knows?

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:47.797
Those are the Plains of Silence.

01:22:50.424 --> 01:22:52.472
Stay right where you are, little Joe.

01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:54.846
Kind of lost its novelty out here.

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:56.688
You having a baby?

01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:59.232
Warlord Junior.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:00.727
Gonna be so ugly.

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:02.773
It could be a girl.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.239
You kill people with that, do you?

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:08.571
Killed everyone I ever met out here.

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:11.161
Headshots. All of them.
Snap. Right in the medulla.

01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:13.371
Thought somehow you girls
were above that.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.165
Come here.

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:27.878
Take a peek.

01:23:28.879 --> 01:23:30.131
Seeds.

01:23:31.131 --> 01:23:32.599
These are from home.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:35.014
Heirlooms. The real thing.

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:37.520
I plant one every chance I get.

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:38.764
Where?

01:23:39.139 --> 01:23:42.063
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

01:23:42.392 --> 01:23:44.144
Aah. S0 many different kinds.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.484
Trees, flowers, fruit.

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:49.567
Back then, everyone had their fill.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:52.494
Back then,
there was no need to snap anybody.

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:08.968
Can I talk to you?

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:31.112
I've talked with the others.

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:41.160
We're never gonna have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:47.333
If we leave the Rig here, and load the
motorcycles up with as much as we can...

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:50.086
...we can maybe ride for 160 days.

01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:54.764
One of those bikes is yours.

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:57.134
Fully loaded.

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:02.435
You're more than welcome
to come with us.

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:08.403
I'll make my own way.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:17.162
You know, hope is a mistake.

01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:27.336
If you can't fix what's broken, you'll, uh...

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:30.884
You'll go insane.

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:48.686
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:52.026
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:55.697
<i>Help us. You promised to help us.</i>

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:08.372
<i>Come on, Pa! Let's go.</i>

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.412
All right.

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:44.912
This is your way home.

01:26:48.412 --> 01:26:49.459
We go back?

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:51.460
Mm.

01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:53.505
- Back?
-Yeah.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.468
I thought you weren't insane anymore.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:56.928
What are they saying?

01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:59.389
He wants to go back from where they came.

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:00.803
The Citadel.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:03.223
What's there to find at the Citadel?

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:05.186
Green.

01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:06.772
And water.

01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:11.894
There's a ridiculous amount of clear water.
And a lot of crops.

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:14.567
Got everything you need.
Long <i>as</i> you're not afraid of heights.

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:15.939
Where does the water come from?

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:19.864
He pumps it up from deep in the earth.
Calls it Aqua Cola and claims it for himself.

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:22.363
And because he owns it, he owns all of us.

01:27:22.612 --> 01:27:23.784
I don't like him already.

01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:26.408
It'll take two weeks
to skirt the Wall of Mountains.

01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:27.580
No.

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:30.545
I suggest we go back the same way we came.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.673
Through the canyon.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:38.588
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:42.466
S0 we take the War Rig and we charge it
right through the middle of them.

01:27:42.716 --> 01:27:43.717
We can decouple the tanker...

01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:45.219
...at the pass.

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:47.096
Shut it off behind us.

01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:48.471
Kaboom.

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:53.857
And how exactly do we take the Citadel?

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:56.192
Assuming we're still alive by then.

01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:59.032
lf we can block the <i>pass,</i> it'll be easy.

01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:03.029
All that's left are his War Pups
and War Boys too sick to fight.

01:28:03.737 --> 01:28:05.489
And we'll be with Nux.

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:07.373
He's a War Boy.

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:10.244
He'll be bringing us home.
Bringing back what's stolen, as he's meant to.

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:14.835
Yeah.

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:17.384
It feels like hope.

01:28:18.585 --> 01:28:20.132
I like this plan.

01:28:20.712 --> 01:28:21.713
We can start again.

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.053
Just like the old days!

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:26.851
Look.

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:29.270
It'll be a hard day.

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:32.816
But I guarantee you
that a 160 days' ride that way...

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.191
...there's nothing but salt.

01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:42.527
At least that way, you know,
we might be able to...

01:28:44.027 --> 01:28:45.279
...together...

01:28:46.863 --> 01:28:48.957
...come across some kind of redemption.

01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:21.106
War Rig!

01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:23.321
That's the War Rig!

01:29:33.326 --> 01:29:34.543
That's them.

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:36.038
Why are they going back?

01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:38.169
Do they wish to surrender?

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:40.376
They are heading for the canyon.

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:45.222
They're going back to the Citadel!

01:29:45.463 --> 01:29:47.136
They know it's undefended!

01:29:47.382 --> 01:29:48.474
Bollocks!

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:50.969
Roll up!

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:02.523
Go!

01:30:24.878 --> 01:30:26.380
- What are you doing?
-Praying.

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:27.597
To who?

01:30:27.839 --> 01:30:29.307
Anyone that's listening.

01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:54.665
Here we go, girls!

01:30:57.327 --> 01:30:58.579
That's mine!

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:04.926
He'll try to get in front of us.
Spike our wheels.

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:13.264
Don't blow my engine.

01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:14.803
Gonna nudge him.

01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:16.145
Just a little.

01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:32.079
You filth! You traitored him!

01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:37.746
Yeah!

01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:56.811
Go.

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:00.394
Aah! Aah!

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.526
Ha!

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:13.198
Aah!

01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:23.880
Gotta back off.

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:27.421
Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.

01:32:27.667 --> 01:32:28.259
Right.

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:30.091
Are you a Black Thumb?

01:32:30.336 --> 01:32:31.383
Uh-huh.

01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:32.881
All right. Engine one. Now.

01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:34.474
You and me. Fifth wheel.

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.009
We'll unhook the tanker.

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:49.568
One man, one bullet.

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.167
- I cannot see.
-Maadi! Maadi!

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:10.589
I can't see.

01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:31.401
Oh.

01:33:49.999 --> 01:33:50.966
Hey!

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:52.711
Harpoons and plows!

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:54.345
They're hauling us back!

01:34:05.598 --> 01:34:07.817
Leave three bolts. Three.

01:35:26.346 --> 01:35:27.097
Hey, you! Aargh!

01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:44.284
Are you okay?

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:48.618
I think she's hurt.

01:36:12.475 --> 01:36:13.271
Hey!

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:40.219
No!

01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:45.557
No!

01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:51.731
Hey.

01:36:52.265 --> 01:36:52.936
<i>Stay with me.</i>

01:36:53.516 --> 01:36:55.268
<i>- Stay</i> with me.
- Stay with me.

01:36:55.518 --> 01:36:56.895
- Hey.
-Hey! Are you there?

01:36:58.771 --> 01:36:59.738
You finish that! I'll finish her!

01:37:08.406 --> 01:37:09.077
Unh!

01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:31.239
Valhalla!

01:38:45.837 --> 01:38:47.009
Aah!

01:38:52.969 --> 01:38:53.561
Ha!

01:39:12.321 --> 01:39:13.163
Engine one's good.

01:39:14.282 --> 01:39:15.454
For now.

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:05.086
She's hurt! She's hurt...

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:06.380
...real bad!

01:40:27.813 --> 01:40:28.484
Aah!

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:37.428
You hear that?

01:41:38.426 --> 01:41:40.019
We're gonna see two airborne V8s.

01:41:41.554 --> 01:41:43.272
I'm gonna need you to drive.

01:41:45.474 --> 01:41:47.147
I'll get him out of our way.

01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:55.465
Rictus!

01:42:56.545 --> 01:42:57.387
Take me!

01:43:10.976 --> 01:43:11.727
Cheedo!

01:43:11.977 --> 01:43:13.524
- What are you doing?
-Good girl.

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:18.984
- Come here.
-Aah!

01:43:21.278 --> 01:43:22.575
Aah!

01:43:24.407 --> 01:43:25.283
Big Boy!

01:43:26.367 --> 01:43:28.040
Aah!

01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:33.382
Here! Here!

01:43:51.642 --> 01:43:52.234
Unh!

01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:28.433
Remember me?

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:32.107
Aah!

01:44:49.784 --> 01:44:50.831
He's dead!

01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:52.832
He's dead.

01:45:11.847 --> 01:45:14.817
When you're across safe,
I'll jam the throttle and follow you.

01:45:15.601 --> 01:45:16.648
Come on!

01:45:17.728 --> 01:45:20.277
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

01:46:07.903 --> 01:46:09.496
Witness me.

01:46:15.953 --> 01:46:16.954
Rictus!

01:47:12.551 --> 01:47:14.178
Why is she making that noise?

01:47:14.428 --> 01:47:16.146
She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

01:47:17.014 --> 01:47:18.561
She's collapsing her lungs...

01:47:18.807 --> 01:47:20.605
...one breath at a time.

01:47:26.357 --> 01:47:27.529
I know.

01:47:30.486 --> 01:47:31.954
I am so sorry.

01:47:34.698 --> 01:47:35.950
I know. I know.

01:47:37.201 --> 01:47:38.544
Hold it there.

01:47:39.411 --> 01:47:40.503
All right.

01:47:41.038 --> 01:47:43.882
Put that on there. Press it in. Hey.

01:47:45.250 --> 01:47:45.921
Hey.

01:47:46.168 --> 01:47:47.294
Home.

01:47:54.593 --> 01:47:55.936
Home.

01:48:02.351 --> 01:48:04.399
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
-She's exsanguinated.

01:48:04.645 --> 01:48:05.942
- Drained all her blood.
-Well...

01:48:07.523 --> 01:48:08.615
Hold these.

01:48:09.441 --> 01:48:10.033
We need that.

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.532
Needle.

01:48:13.529 --> 01:48:14.405
Come on.

01:48:15.823 --> 01:48:16.494
Take this.

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:20.456
Keep her awake.

01:48:21.370 --> 01:48:22.622
Furiosa.

01:48:26.291 --> 01:48:28.464
Okay, that's not retracting.

01:48:29.128 --> 01:48:30.345
There we go.

01:48:31.213 --> 01:48:33.136
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

01:48:34.717 --> 01:48:35.889
All right.

01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:36.931
Sorry.

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:41.815
There you go. Okay. There you go.

01:48:54.319 --> 01:48:55.536
Max.

01:48:56.864 --> 01:48:58.366
My name is Max.

01:48:59.867 --> 01:49:02.416
Yeah. Mm-hm.

01:49:02.745 --> 01:49:04.167
Mm.

01:49:07.124 --> 01:49:08.717
That's my name.

01:49:50.584 --> 01:49:51.255
Brake!

01:49:57.132 --> 01:49:58.258
Reveal yourself.

01:50:17.402 --> 01:50:18.699
He's got something.

01:50:25.994 --> 01:50:26.916
It's lmmortan Joe.

01:50:27.663 --> 01:50:29.085
The lmmortan Joe is dead!

01:50:56.275 --> 01:50:57.527
Furiosa!

01:50:57.818 --> 01:50:58.990
Furiosa!

01:50:59.236 --> 01:51:00.328
Furiosa!

01:51:00.571 --> 01:51:01.697
Furiosa!

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:03.873
Furiosa!

01:51:04.241 --> 01:51:05.663
She's back.

01:51:05.909 --> 01:51:08.503
<i>Let them up! Let them up!</i>

01:51:08.745 --> 01:51:10.213
<i>Let them up!</i>

01:51:10.455 --> 01:51:12.503
<i>Let them up! Let them up!</i>

01:51:15.878 --> 01:51:16.925
Come on, let's do it!

01:51:17.171 --> 01:51:18.673
Let them up. Come on.

01:51:51.205 --> 01:51:52.502
Come on.
