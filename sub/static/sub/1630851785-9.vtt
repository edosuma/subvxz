00:04.395 --> 00:06.615
if you ever feeling down
and want some inspiration,

00:06.658 --> 00:08.399
I want you to look
at this wall, man.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.271
All these fighters
have one thing in common.

00:10.314 --> 00:11.794
They all hail
from Brooklyn, man,

00:11.837 --> 00:14.188
and nobody on this wall
ever gave up.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.406
- I think
that's two things, Dad.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.930
- Mark Breland,
Olympic gold medalist,

00:17.974 --> 00:19.367
welterweight champion
of the world.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.717
- We come from the same projects.
- Really?

00:21.760 --> 00:23.719
- He personally autographed
this picture for me.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.548
Won more Golden Gloves
than Sugar Ray Robinson.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.071
- I would love to fight
in the Golden Gloves one day.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.638
I know I'd win it.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.814
- Well, if you
really believe that, Javi,

00:31.857 --> 00:33.207
we can make that happen.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.122
Just the person
I was looking for.

00:35.165 --> 00:37.080
- No. Mm-mm.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.082
- Plan B.
Don't you worry.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.823
I'ma get you
in the Golden Gloves.

00:40.866 --> 00:43.173
- Until that happens,
I need to get your sizes

00:43.217 --> 00:44.827
so I can get you
into a tux for prom.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.394
- Yeah, and I don't want no
funny business after the prom.

00:46.437 --> 00:48.091
You hear me?
That's my little girl.

00:48.135 --> 00:50.050
I want the same little girl
going, coming back.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.312
No hotels, no motels,

00:51.355 --> 00:54.402
no rec room sins,
especially no smush house.

00:54.445 --> 00:57.100
Side of the road it is.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.188
What?

00:58.232 --> 01:00.495
You told me to never give up.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.936
- We are so grateful
to have Brooklyn's own

01:06.979 --> 01:08.503
renowned street artist...

01:08.546 --> 01:11.071
Fukwon.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.681
- Fukwon.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.248
Yes!

01:14.291 --> 01:16.467
Fukwon has chosen
our community center

01:16.511 --> 01:18.774
as a canvas
for his latest installation,

01:18.817 --> 01:21.603
"Pioneers
of the Civil Rights Movement."

01:21.646 --> 01:23.300
My brother, my brother,

01:23.344 --> 01:28.088
please tell us more about
this beautiful installation.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.177
- No.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.615
- Okay, y'all, he don't
want to say nothing else.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.704
So you can just go on
ahead and reveal it.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.488
On the count of three,
all right?

01:37.532 --> 01:38.272
Three...

01:38.315 --> 01:41.013
all: Two, one...

01:41.057 --> 01:42.406
Go!

01:50.762 --> 01:52.677
- Who the hell
are these people?

01:52.721 --> 01:54.679
What happened to John Lewis,

01:54.723 --> 01:57.204
Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman,
Sojourner Truth?

01:57.247 --> 01:59.380
These look like aliens
that impersonated them.

01:59.423 --> 02:02.034
This is what they look like

02:02.078 --> 02:04.211
in the world that I created.

02:04.254 --> 02:07.866
This is some ugly shit, sir.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.172
You're welcome.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.739
This shit give me heartburn.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.523
I think that's Harriet Tubman

02:12.567 --> 02:14.917
- or Lil Wayne--one or the other.
- They're clowning it.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.354
I'm sorry, but we gonna have
to paint over this shit.

02:17.398 --> 02:20.183
- You do, and you'll hear
from my lawyers.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.011
No, no, my brother.

02:22.054 --> 02:24.709
This wall is a part
of our community center.

02:24.753 --> 02:27.364
It is within my rights
to paint over it.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.758
This is art on a loan.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.760
If you want to paint over it,

02:31.803 --> 02:33.631
you're gonna have
to purchase it.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.242
I ain't paying for shit.

02:35.285 --> 02:37.026
Get the fuck outta my face
with this dumbass...

02:37.069 --> 02:41.552
- Looks like the horn section
from Earth, Wind & Fire.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.946
Ah, I don't understand it.

02:43.989 --> 02:46.427
It looks like a yearbook
full of abortions.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.559
Are they dead?
They're dead.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.082
They gotta be dead.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.175
- Veesy.
- Hmm?

02:55.218 --> 02:56.437
We need to talk

02:56.480 --> 02:58.178
about getting some money
for a boxing trainer.

02:58.221 --> 03:00.789
- No, Tray, look, our budget
is stretched completely.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.486
If you cannot pay him
in thank-yous

03:02.530 --> 03:04.009
and good-looking-outs,
then you can't afford him.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.837
- But you can afford
this bullshit-ass mural?

03:05.881 --> 03:08.405
- For your information, this
bullshit-ass mural was free

03:08.449 --> 03:10.364
'cause I promised to rename
the art room

03:10.407 --> 03:12.670
after the bitch-ass artist,
Fukwon.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.455
That's how it works, okay?

03:14.498 --> 03:16.544
If you can't afford it,
gotta get them to donate it.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.244
- You know what, Veesy?
You just gave me an idea.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.681
And don't be so hard
on yourself about that mural.

03:23.725 --> 03:26.554
I love the joint he did about
Ben Vereen and Nell Carter.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.208
Brought back a lot of memories.

03:28.251 --> 03:31.341
Ideas, ideas--we all get 'em.
We all get 'em.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.951
Fuck Fukwon.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.783
- You got to call
my cousin Lance, man.

03:38.827 --> 03:41.221
He trained this kid who fought
in the Golden Gloves.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.223
- He's nice.
- Well, where the kid at now?

03:43.266 --> 03:44.354
- He died, but listen--

03:44.398 --> 03:45.964
- Listen, what do I want
his number for?

03:46.008 --> 03:48.097
The kid he was training
is dead.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.403
Hater.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.100
- Yo, Tray,
I got what you need.

03:51.143 --> 03:52.536
I found Teddy Atlas.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.538
- Ooh, Teddy Atlas,
the house DJ from Chicago?

03:54.582 --> 03:56.192
I didn't know he was in town.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.281
- He's a professional
boxing trainer, Leah.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.674
He trained Mike Tyson.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.371
- My boy cut Teddy
for a benefit

04:01.415 --> 04:02.546
he's hosting in Staten Island.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.461
Mark Breland's
supposed to be there.

04:04.505 --> 04:07.029
- Mark Breland? That's dope.
We from the same projects, man.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.813
Yo, I need to get
into that benefit, man.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.467
- Send me the information.
- Done.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.904
It's Staten Island--my man
says dress appropriately.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.645
- What your tall ass
doing in Staten Island?

04:14.689 --> 04:16.125
You can't even fit
on the ferry.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.387
I didn't take the ferry.

04:17.431 --> 04:19.128
Your mom drove me
in her minivan.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.443
- Man, I thought this was
a black-tie event.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.314
- Ha ha.
You thought wrong.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.750
Oh.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.971
- B-Hop, AKA Primetime.
- That's me.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.538
Wow, and in full effect, man.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.801
- Your left hand is devastating.
- Thanks, kid.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.324
- You fight?
- Every goddamn day, man.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.412
The struggle is real.

04:42.456 --> 04:43.718
- Shit, you must be
from Brooklyn.

04:43.761 --> 04:44.719
And you know that.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.503
I'm from Brookline.

04:46.547 --> 04:47.896
You look like Robert Kraft,

04:47.939 --> 04:49.680
owner
of the New England Patriots.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.553
- What you doing here?
- Teddy and I go way back.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.685
I love what he does
for the kids.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.687
- We got something
in common, man, you know.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.298
And I'm looking for him.
Have you seen him?

04:58.341 --> 04:59.603
Oh, look, there he go.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.823
- Pleasure.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.694
- Oh, hey, cool, I'ma holla
at Teddy Atlas

05:03.738 --> 05:05.479
in the bathroom
real quick, okay?

05:06.480 --> 05:07.916
Not weird at all.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.708
- Uh, Mr. Atlas,
uh, Tray Barker--

05:17.752 --> 05:19.841
Tompkins-Marcy
Community Center.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.930
I'd like to say
I'm a big fan!

05:21.973 --> 05:23.366
And, um...

05:23.410 --> 05:26.456
I appreciate what you've done
for the sport of boxing!

05:26.500 --> 05:29.720
- Thanks, but this is no place
for a conversation, all right?

05:29.764 --> 05:31.461
I know it seems awkward,

05:31.505 --> 05:33.463
but I really would like for you
to look at my boxer.

05:33.507 --> 05:36.727
- Listen, buddy, I already hate
doing these fundraisers,

05:36.771 --> 05:38.947
and right now you're making it
a lot harder.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.471
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for bothering you.

05:44.039 --> 05:47.608
Damn, Teddy, you making me
a little woozy, man.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.566
I could use
a standing eight count.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.699
- Would you please leave?
Get out of here.

05:51.742 --> 05:54.310
- All right, I'm sorry
to bother you, man.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.313
Have a mint?

06:00.751 --> 06:03.493
- I don't keep cash
in my tuxedo.

06:10.892 --> 06:13.764
- Mr. Breland.
- Not this guy again.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.898
- The salmon is overcooked.
Trust me.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.465
Now, see this guy right here?

06:18.508 --> 06:21.642
He came back to the projects
when I was only waist-high.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.557
He was unselfish with his time.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.559
He even hung his gold medal
around my neck,

06:25.602 --> 06:27.256
giving me hope.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.650
I never forgot that.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.173
All I want to do
is pass that hope

06:31.216 --> 06:32.783
down to the kids
in the neighborhood.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.394
See, now,
what I need you guys to do--

06:34.437 --> 06:36.178
I want you to train
this fighter, right?

06:36.221 --> 06:37.614
- 'Cause he is super--
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.181
I don't train up-and-comers.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.052
- I didn't know you felt
that way, Mr. Breland.

06:41.096 --> 06:44.055
- Listen, can I get a waiter
not in a tuxedo, please?

06:44.099 --> 06:46.580
You know what?

06:46.623 --> 06:48.320
The guy in that photo is gone.

06:48.364 --> 06:51.193
For the record,
I make better salmon in prison

06:51.236 --> 06:53.456
using catfish
and curling irons.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.153
Have a nice supper.

07:00.463 --> 07:01.812
- I don't get it--
why don't you just say,

07:01.856 --> 07:03.553
"Yo, you want to go
to the prom?"

07:03.597 --> 07:06.469
- 'Cause the prom-posal
makes the girl feel special.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.297
- It's pretty cool.
They get really creative.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.473
- So it's like making a mixtape
for a girl.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.780
I was a master of mixtapes,
you know what I mean?

07:12.823 --> 07:14.651
You and your sister,
y'all wouldn't be here today

07:14.695 --> 07:16.610
if it wasn't for mixtapes.

07:16.653 --> 07:19.308
- So Godspeed, young lion.

07:19.351 --> 07:21.136
- Ta-da!

07:21.179 --> 07:24.008
What do we think?
Mom sent it from Paris.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.054
- Stunning.
- Wow.

07:26.097 --> 07:28.360
You look every bit
as beautiful as your mother.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.275
- I can't wait
until Javi sees it.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.234
- Before Javi see it,
maybe you should throw

07:32.277 --> 07:34.628
on a turtleneck
or a goose-down shawl,

07:34.671 --> 07:36.891
just to stay warm--
cover up a little bit.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.241
And besides, the weather
out there is funny.

07:39.284 --> 07:40.677
It's funny, baby.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.593
You know, it can go
from 100 degrees to 10 below

07:43.637 --> 07:45.073
just like that.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.467
You sure about this guy?

07:47.510 --> 07:49.773
- I'm telling you,
there's nobody like him.

07:49.817 --> 07:52.472
Key to boxing is footwork.

07:52.515 --> 07:56.127
Now, I want you to do as I do.
Put up your guards out.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.520
Will, hit it!

08:01.611 --> 08:03.526
- What?
- What the fuck?

08:03.570 --> 08:05.006
Come on, man.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.312
Hakeem Olajuwon played soccer
for his footwork.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.880
Herschel Walker, he did ballet.
Lance uses tap, man.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.578
He's innovative, man.
Just give him a chance.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.580
Lance, hit 'em
with the paradiddle.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.191
- Holy shit.
- Yes, holy shit.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.762
What are you guys doing here?

08:21.805 --> 08:23.415
- We wound up talking
at the benefit.

08:23.459 --> 08:24.982
Figured if you're willing to go
through all that trouble

08:25.026 --> 08:26.723
for a fighter,
we should take a look.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.856
- I hope that's not the guy
back there tap-dancing.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.860
- Oh, nah.
Nah, nah, nah.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.644
- Oh, yeah,
you forgot your picture.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.385
Oh, wow.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.256
Mark, I know
the perfect place for this.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.737
- You know, he does have
pretty good footwork, though.

08:46.090 --> 08:49.006
Move with the last punch.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.791
- There you go. Now...
- That's it.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.706
Now you're doing it.

08:52.749 --> 08:55.012
Not bad.
Actually, not bad at all.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.579
All right, I'll set up
a fight for him.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.059
I'm ready.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.669
- But if I do this,
I don't want it getting around.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.584
I want it to stay between us,

09:01.628 --> 09:03.368
because, otherwise, I'm gonna
have every rec center around

09:03.412 --> 09:05.327
asking me to do
the same thing for them.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.285
- Yes, sir. Man, you know, just
a quiet little Brooklyn thing.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.157
- I'll come by later and give
you a few pointers if you like.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.724
- Oh, my God.
Thanks, sir.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.595
- A lot of kids look good
in the gym.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.554
Taking a punch in the ring
is totally different.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.599
- Javi can take a punch
better than my uncle Michael

09:16.643 --> 09:19.471
after he tried to tip a
stripper with a bag of nickels.

09:21.822 --> 09:24.346
- I'm wearing this one.
- What are you wearing to prom?

09:24.389 --> 09:27.392
- My mom designed me
something in Europe.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.830
- Ooh, a custom piece?
- Is that a flex?

09:29.873 --> 09:31.788
- Yes, ma'am.
- Attention, everyone.

09:31.832 --> 09:34.748
I believe we have
a special pop-quiz.

09:36.271 --> 09:37.838
Hello, class.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.797
What do you get
if you mix radium

09:40.841 --> 09:42.886
with iodine

09:42.930 --> 09:45.454
and top it off with nitrogen?

09:45.497 --> 09:46.803
It spells "Rain," get it?

09:46.847 --> 09:50.764
And I was hoping
she'll be my date to...

09:52.766 --> 09:54.724
Oh, my God.

09:54.768 --> 09:55.856
Is she smiling?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.989
- No.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.601
- No?
- Tough break, buddy.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.430
- I thought we had
something special.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.650
- Shahzad, I'm sorry
if you misunderstood

10:07.694 --> 10:09.478
when we hooked up, but...

10:09.521 --> 10:11.785
I was just using you
for your body.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.003
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.790
- Okay, I'm gonna go get
the health teacher.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.922
Nobody says a word
till I get back.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.797
There you go.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.841
That's it.

10:24.885 --> 10:26.713
He don't look bad.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.150
Still got a lot to learn,
but there's some talent there.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.021
- Told you he got
what it takes.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.849
- Excuse me.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.982
I got to take this call, okay?

10:35.025 --> 10:36.853
- Dad.
Oh, my God.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.855
You should've seen
Shahzad's prom-posal.

10:38.899 --> 10:41.075
- How did it go?
- To put in boxing terms,

10:41.118 --> 10:42.467
he got knocked out.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.295
And then she kicked him.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.210
- Oh, no, don't worry
about it, son.

10:46.254 --> 10:48.082
I mean, if it don't break you,
it's gonna make you stronger,

10:48.125 --> 10:50.693
but you really should get rid
of that jacket...

10:50.737 --> 10:52.434
'cause it sucks!

10:52.477 --> 10:53.696
But I sewed it myself.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.698
- All right, I just got
some good news.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.613
Just got a call from my friend.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.571
He's got a fighter
that's looking to turn pro.

10:59.615 --> 11:02.270
Just had a cancelation.
They need to fight next Friday.

11:02.313 --> 11:04.838
They're willing to fight Javi
if we can do it right here.

11:04.881 --> 11:07.057
- Oh!
Oh, boy.

11:07.101 --> 11:08.885
Friday is a bit quick,
but we'll be ready.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.104
Wait, Dad!

11:10.147 --> 11:11.801
- You know, we can fix up
the ring a bit.

11:11.845 --> 11:12.976
- Dad!
- Get some people in here,

11:13.020 --> 11:14.195
fill it up, get the ring hot.

11:14.238 --> 11:15.892
- Dad!
- Yes, baby?

11:15.936 --> 11:17.589
My prom is next Friday.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.069
What?

11:19.113 --> 11:21.158
- Can we change the fight
to another day?

11:21.202 --> 11:24.901
- Nah, it's gotta be Friday.
This kid's on a schedule.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.642
Hey, it's the break you need.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.950
Amira, what do you think?

11:31.212 --> 11:32.692
- I think we both know
what you're gonna choose,

11:32.735 --> 11:35.346
and it doesn't matter
how I feel about it.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.872
Amira.

11:38.915 --> 11:40.874
Yo, my man.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.789
You ain't gonna go after her?

11:42.832 --> 11:44.660
Who raised you, son?

11:46.009 --> 11:47.445
Amira.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.711
That jacket sucks.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.239
- Hey, kiddo.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.457
Hi.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.118
- We know
you sad and disappointed.

12:08.162 --> 12:11.121
Nothing we can say
that's gonna change it.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.167
But we love you,

12:13.210 --> 12:18.085
and we're here to listen
and validate your feelings.

12:18.128 --> 12:20.957
- Mom told you to say that.
- Absolutely.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.654
- 100%.
- Yeah, that's right.

12:22.698 --> 12:25.135
- Now, our plan
was to bring doughnuts

12:25.179 --> 12:27.007
and an Amazon gift card.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.095
- Which is in the other room.
- Yeah.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.923
Just in case
validating your feelings

12:29.966 --> 12:31.838
doesn't cheer you up.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.888
- I mean, I know
he has to fight.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.411
It's his big chance.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.413
It just sucks.

12:42.457 --> 12:45.373
- Let it out. Let it all out.
- That's it.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.070
- That's all?
- Yeah.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.899
- I know it's disappointing
when someone's good thing

12:49.943 --> 12:51.988
is a bad thing for you.

12:52.032 --> 12:54.556
Like when your celly
gets early parole

12:54.599 --> 12:57.646
and you find out that your new
celly is a high-pitched crier.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.389
- Let me tell you something,
little girl.

13:01.432 --> 13:04.566
Your life is gonna be full
of excitement and adventure.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.394
All this stuff
you going through now

13:06.437 --> 13:08.918
is just gonna
make you stronger--that's it.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.180
Mom again?

13:10.224 --> 13:13.096
- Mm-mm. That's all him.

13:14.663 --> 13:15.925
Mm.

13:15.969 --> 13:19.015
I love you guys.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.408
Amira...

13:20.451 --> 13:23.759
you're very important to us.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.637
They did such a good job.

13:32.681 --> 13:35.989
- Hi.
- Are you serious right now?

13:36.032 --> 13:38.992
Did you honestly think
coming to the prom with my dad

13:39.035 --> 13:40.167
was going to be
less embarrassing

13:40.210 --> 13:41.646
than not having a date?

13:41.690 --> 13:43.735
- No, no, no.
I'm a--I'm a chaperone.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.085
I'm a chaperone.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.827
- I thought the chaperones
were staying inside.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.612
- Okay, yeah, you got me--
I'm just a corny dad,

13:50.655 --> 13:54.050
and I'm trying to help
my daughter feel better, okay?

13:54.094 --> 13:55.573
- Come on.

13:55.617 --> 13:58.054
Can we at least take
a picture for your mother?

13:58.098 --> 13:59.708
One?

13:59.751 --> 14:01.101
Fine.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.799
- Maybe five?
- One picture.

14:05.932 --> 14:10.893
- No, that's Cuba Gooding Jr.
and his brother Omar.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.112
I think it's an homage

14:12.155 --> 14:14.027
to "Family Matters"
season four, episode 10,

14:14.070 --> 14:16.507
called, "It's Beginning
To Look A Lot Like Urkel."

14:16.551 --> 14:18.596
Very underrated episode,
if I might add.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.207
- Oh, I see it.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.165
And that's the daughter
from "Family Matters"

14:22.209 --> 14:25.908
who went upstairs season one,
never came back down.

14:25.952 --> 14:26.953
Hey, Judy.

14:26.996 --> 14:29.303
- All right.
Keep it moving.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.261
Fight is inside.
There's nothing to see here.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.089
- I see you, Judy.
- No pictures.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.222
- Okay.
- All right, God bless.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.492
- How you feel?
- They feel good.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.798
- I ain't talking about the
gloves; I'm talking about you.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.061
How you feel?

14:48.104 --> 14:49.497
Good.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.934
Yo, Tray,
thank you for everything.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.284
Thank me for nothing, man.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.373
All I did was crack the door
open for you, young blood.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.027
You decided to walk through.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.725
All your hard work is gonna
bring a lot of attention

15:00.769 --> 15:03.032
to this center,
help a lot more kids.

15:03.076 --> 15:08.037
And pretty soon,
they gonna be thanking you.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.734
Let's go.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.040
Okay, smile.

15:11.084 --> 15:12.999
- I feel like I'm the only
one smiling.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.566
- That's 'cause you are.
She's not smiling.

15:16.698 --> 15:19.005
- Great. Next.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.094
- When we go in,
no eye contact.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.834
Don't stand close to me.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.836
Don't dance with me.
Don't even dance by yourself.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.971
Don't sing and don't even
move your lips to the words.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.799
Where are you guys going?

15:30.842 --> 15:32.322
- The DJ is only playing
the clean versions,

15:32.366 --> 15:34.411
Mrs. Landers is measuring
everyone's dress length,

15:34.455 --> 15:36.370
and the dean
has a breathalyzer.

15:36.413 --> 15:37.980
Prom is officially lame.

15:38.024 --> 15:41.157
We're going back
to the party bus.

15:41.201 --> 15:44.421
- Well, seems like you're not
missing much in there.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.077
- No, but I am missing
something.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.700
<i>- Eso, Javito.</i>

16:13.755 --> 16:15.061
Hey, you.

16:16.845 --> 16:19.630
- crowd: Whoa!
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

16:21.676 --> 16:23.765
Whoa, whoa.

16:25.158 --> 16:28.335
- You're doing great.
You're doing great, Javi.

16:29.771 --> 16:30.990
Now relax.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.730
- Take a deep breath.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.558
- You won that round, but now
he's gonna be looking

16:34.602 --> 16:36.169
to set you up for one shot.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.300
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.562
He's gonna come out fast.

16:38.606 --> 16:41.000
- Be alert.
- You got this, Javi.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.453
Come on, Javi!

16:59.496 --> 17:01.672
Javi?

17:01.716 --> 17:03.196
Javi!

17:05.067 --> 17:07.200
- Now we'll find out
if he's a real fighter.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.507
Javi.

17:10.551 --> 17:13.119
I did not skip prom to watch
you get your ass beat.

17:13.162 --> 17:16.600
Come on, let's go.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.080
- You okay?
- I'm good.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.864
- Can you continue?
- Yeah.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.344
Okay, box. Let's go.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.433
- That's all you got?
- Tough kid.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.174
- Damn, I guess
he is a fighter.

17:25.218 --> 17:27.002
- I told you!
I told you!

17:42.191 --> 17:44.454
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

17:52.158 --> 17:53.898
We're on our way!

17:59.687 --> 18:00.775
So good.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.690
- Congratulations, Javi.
- Thank you.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.300
Hey, I'm sorry
I didn't make it to prom.

18:04.344 --> 18:07.216
- I'm not. This was way better.
That was amazing.

18:07.260 --> 18:10.306
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're sweaty.

18:10.350 --> 18:11.264
Just a little bit.

18:11.307 --> 18:12.787
I'm sorry. I was a jerk.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.789
I should've said yes
to your prom-posal.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.921
It was very sweet.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.532
That's cool.

18:18.575 --> 18:21.404
- Wanna go make out?
- Yeah.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.363
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

18:23.406 --> 18:25.539
Nice, boy. Nice work.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.454
Told you he's the real deal,
and this is just the start.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.412
Javi's gonna put this center
on the map.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.501
- Still got a lot to learn,
but you're gifted.

18:31.545 --> 18:32.850
- That's right,
and with y'all on,

18:32.894 --> 18:34.200
we can raise money
for the center

18:34.243 --> 18:35.853
for better equipment,
more space.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.768
Fights on the regular.
This gonna be the spot.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.379
That's not gonna work for me.

18:39.422 --> 18:40.989
I think he has the talent
to turn pro.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.295
There's no doubt about it,

18:42.338 --> 18:44.166
but if he's gonna do it,
you got to do it right.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.647
You have to get away
from all the distractions.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.389
If you're interested, I have
a camp up in the Poconos.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.304
Poconos?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.393
He can't do that here?

18:53.436 --> 18:55.743
- You gotta be dedicated.
You know that.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.527
You wouldn't have came to us
in the first place

18:57.571 --> 18:59.268
if you didn't realize that.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.531
That's right. I knew that.

19:01.575 --> 19:04.404
You gonna be the best,
you got to train with the best.

19:04.447 --> 19:05.753
Javi, when you win that belt,

19:05.796 --> 19:07.624
just come back
to the neighborhood, man.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.018
Show the kids, man, so they
can be inspired to work hard

19:10.061 --> 19:12.194
- and be great just like you.
- I will.

19:12.238 --> 19:16.111
- How would you like that, kid?
- I'd like that. Thanks, man.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.461
- You should go talk
to your mom about that.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.519
- Someone very smart
told me once,

19:32.562 --> 19:34.564
"It's disappointing
when someone's good thing

19:34.608 --> 19:36.044
"is a bad thing for you,

19:36.087 --> 19:38.655
"but life is full
of exciting adventures.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.745
This is just something that's
gonna make you stronger."

19:42.485 --> 19:44.531
My dear daughter, I love you.

19:44.574 --> 19:48.187
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Dad.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.626
What's up, old head?

19:52.669 --> 19:54.932
Can you teach me to fight?

19:54.976 --> 19:58.066
- Well,
it's not called fighting.

19:58.109 --> 19:59.372
It's called boxing.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.590
With a mouth like yours,

20:00.634 --> 20:03.593
you gonna have to learn
how to defend it.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.205
Let me see your stance.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.642
Okay, that's a good stance,
right there.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.600
Now let me see you
throw a jab.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.385
A little harder.
Yeah.

20:12.428 --> 20:14.125
- Yeah.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.221
Hey, what's going on?

20:22.264 --> 20:24.658
- Somebody painted dicks
all over the Jacksons.

20:24.701 --> 20:25.963
Rebbie got it the worst.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.009
- Mm, I thought
that was La Toya.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.403
- Well, whoever it is,
this shit is vandalism.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.143
So, unfortunately,

20:32.187 --> 20:34.450
we're gonna have to paint
over this shameful display.

20:34.494 --> 20:35.973
I feel you, queen.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.584
I'ma go get some paint,
but, uh, you need me to get

20:37.627 --> 20:39.281
some turpentine for this
yellow paint on your hand?

20:39.325 --> 20:40.978
- Get off my hand, boy,
and go on down there

20:41.022 --> 20:42.937
- and get the paint.
- I don't know nothing. Ooh.

20:42.980 --> 20:46.984
- Damn, Jermaine got a huge
fucking cock.
