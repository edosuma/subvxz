00:00.493 --> 00:03.153
Your Uncle Barney was always
always a bit of an enigma.

00:03.163 --> 00:04.937
In all the years we
lived in New York,

00:04.947 --> 00:07.651
none of us had ever set
foot in his apartment.

00:07.661 --> 00:10.832
Until one day, one of us did.

00:13.660 --> 00:15.246
It's a pretty good story.

00:15.256 --> 00:18.132
And believe it or not,
alcohol did not play a role.

00:18.142 --> 00:20.959
It all started two weeks
earlier at Lily's housewarming.

00:21.109 --> 00:23.455
Hey, welcome to my new home.

00:23.465 --> 00:26.232
Oh, wow, Lily, this is...

00:26.487 --> 00:28.491
Oh, this is all of it.

00:28.503 --> 00:31.141
Yeah, I know it's small,
but it's got character.

00:31.157 --> 00:31.913
Thank you.

00:31.929 --> 00:35.422
And I am learning Lithuanian
from my neighbors.

00:35.438 --> 00:36.270
They're great.

00:36.285 --> 00:37.903
They're always out there in the hall,
you know,

00:37.938 --> 00:40.611
cooking and gambling and
giving each other haircuts.

00:40.627 --> 00:42.103
It's nice.

00:42.368 --> 00:44.400
Hey, is that a toilet
in your kitchen?

00:44.416 --> 00:46.580
Or a stove in your bathroom?

00:46.595 --> 00:49.153
Oh, that's not just a stove.

00:49.168 --> 00:50.823
That's a stovenkerator:

00:50.836 --> 00:54.782
a combination of a stove,
oven and sink and refrigerator.

00:54.798 --> 00:56.120
Stovenkerator.

00:56.135 --> 00:57.621
Isn't that futuristic?

00:57.635 --> 00:59.071
God, I hope not.

00:59.085 --> 01:01.810
Hey, cool Murphy bed.

01:01.828 --> 01:05.160
Yeah, it's kind of a mess.
I didn't make my bed this morning, so...

01:05.175 --> 01:06.510
Oh!

01:07.877 --> 01:11.820
You know what, I bet sleeping
at this angle is good for you.

01:11.838 --> 01:13.433
For some reason.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.240
I got it.

01:20.148 --> 01:24.290
That was, something, something,
I am going to, something,

01:24.306 --> 01:27.422
you like a, something, donkey.

01:27.435 --> 01:28.912
Huh.

01:29.068 --> 01:31.080
Other cultures.

01:31.095 --> 01:33.920
Hey, let's break out
the fruit basket.

01:33.935 --> 01:36.051
Hey, who ate all the...?

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.615 --> 01:57.230
Okay, we have to get Lily out of that
apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.

01:57.245 --> 02:00.512
I'd offer her my place,
but I've got dogs and she's allergic.

02:00.525 --> 02:03.852
Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think 
she's a little more allergic to that.

02:03.868 --> 02:06.382
What about your place, Barney?
I know it's shrouded in mystery,

02:06.395 --> 02:07.573
but it's gotta have a couch.

02:07.587 --> 02:09.889
The Fortress of Barnitude?
No way.

02:09.907 --> 02:11.321
Come on. She's desperate.

02:11.338 --> 02:13.451
Hmm, normally a prerequisite
for the women I bring home,

02:13.485 --> 02:15.033
but... pass.

02:15.048 --> 02:19.422
One of you guys is very,
very lucky because I have...

02:19.435 --> 02:22.891
a boom, an extra ticket to the
Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in?

02:22.907 --> 02:24.380
- Absolutely not.
- No.

02:24.396 --> 02:27.352
Damn! I got these tickets,
like, months ago for me and Lily

02:27.368 --> 02:29.710
and now I can't find
anyone to go with me.

02:29.725 --> 02:31.692
This is what I miss
about being in a couple.

02:31.707 --> 02:33.661
I always had someone to
go to concerts with,

02:33.676 --> 02:35.251
or farmer's market,

02:35.267 --> 02:36.843
or brunch.

02:36.855 --> 02:38.482
God, I miss brunch!

02:38.497 --> 02:41.471
Well, I guess you could-- well,
you could try going to brunch alone.

02:41.487 --> 02:43.581
Oh, you don't think I've tried?

02:43.846 --> 02:45.262
Table for one.

02:45.278 --> 02:47.571
One couple?

02:47.585 --> 02:48.943
Um, no, just me.

02:48.956 --> 02:50.343
Really?

02:50.357 --> 02:52.141
For brunch?

02:52.156 --> 02:54.291
You're right. Who am I kidding?

02:55.298 --> 02:58.662
Ooh, The Popover Pantry. That place is
great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?

02:58.675 --> 03:00.052
Of course, sweetie.

03:00.065 --> 03:01.260
Can I go with you guys?

03:01.277 --> 03:03.893
Really? For brunch?

03:04.046 --> 03:06.542
God, I hate being single!

03:09.506 --> 03:11.762
Okay, I'll take the over
on the Pittsburgh game.

03:11.776 --> 03:13.993
Oh, and P.
to the S., I never got my payout

03:14.005 --> 03:16.053
from Seattle from
two weeks ago.

03:16.065 --> 03:20.271
Yeah. Don't make me call the
gaming commission on you.

03:20.285 --> 03:23.382
I'm sure they'd be very interested
to know what's going on over there.

03:23.397 --> 03:26.090
All right? All right?

03:26.668 --> 03:29.012
Okay, I love you, too, Mom.
Take care.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.431
Hello, Lily.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.732
You've somehow managed to
circumvent my security.

03:39.748 --> 03:41.583
How  did you do it?

03:41.597 --> 03:43.313
Ted gave me your spare key.

03:43.325 --> 03:45.420
Spare key, brilliant!

03:45.436 --> 03:47.613
I'm sorry,
but you know I'd only come here

03:47.625 --> 03:49.691
if I had no other choice.

03:49.707 --> 03:53.453
But earlier today, I was getting
ready to go to sleep and...

04:05.928 --> 04:07.620
Sveikas.

04:10.707 --> 04:12.753
That's terrible.

04:12.765 --> 04:14.460
Well, see ya.

04:14.475 --> 04:16.683
Well, can I stay here maybe?

04:16.695 --> 04:20.170
Oh... I'd let you,
but I don't have any room.

04:20.185 --> 04:22.252
You live in a
two-bedroom apartment.

04:22.268 --> 04:25.083
You have one room
just for your suits.

04:25.097 --> 04:29.090
Hey, I'm at a point in my life
where my suits are my family.

04:29.108 --> 04:31.151
Look around you, Lily.

04:31.167 --> 04:33.780
You are in the heart
of bachelor country,

04:33.795 --> 04:37.113
and as a woman,
you are an illegal immigrant here.

04:37.127 --> 04:41.151
Now, you can try to apply for a sex
visa, but that only lasts 12 hours.

04:41.167 --> 04:44.303
14 if you qualify
for multiple entry.

04:44.535 --> 04:49.331
Eww... is something some lame,
judgmental chick would say,

04:49.345 --> 04:53.141
but I say give me
multiple high fives.

04:53.346 --> 04:55.590
Wow, you really are desperate.

04:55.607 --> 04:56.782
I really am.

04:56.795 --> 05:00.713
Okay, you can stay
here for two days.

05:00.725 --> 05:04.730
But I only have one rule.
You can't change anything.

05:04.745 --> 05:07.903
Why would I change anything?
This place is...

05:08.565 --> 05:09.940
...perfect.

05:10.658 --> 05:13.261
Except for the fact that
you don't have a TV.

05:13.276 --> 05:15.313
See that wall?

05:18.778 --> 05:21.953
300-inch flat-screen.

05:21.968 --> 05:24.872
They only sell them in Japan,
but I know a guy.

05:25.046 --> 05:28.683
Had to ship it over in a
tugboat like freakin' King Kong.

05:28.697 --> 05:30.140
It hurts my eyes.

05:30.156 --> 05:33.080
Yeah. That doesn't go away.

05:34.396 --> 05:36.492
- Hey.
- Hey, where have you been?

05:36.508 --> 05:38.220
The Alanis Morissette concert.

05:38.235 --> 05:39.301
By yourself?

05:39.315 --> 05:41.622
No, actually I went with
a friend from law school.

05:41.635 --> 05:44.980
Oh, really? Who's this friend?

05:44.998 --> 05:46.763
Brad.

05:47.458 --> 05:51.052
- Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks!
- Totally!

05:51.065 --> 05:52.780
I can't believe I almost
didn't come tonight.

05:52.817 --> 05:54.581
Let me guess:
You bought the tickets for you and Lily

05:54.618 --> 05:56.093
right before she dumped you.

05:56.108 --> 05:57.962
Yeah, how'd you know?

05:57.978 --> 05:59.750
I just got dumped myself.

05:59.768 --> 06:02.443
What, Kara broke up with you?

06:03.136 --> 06:05.532
I'm sorry, man. That sucks.

06:08.437 --> 06:10.431
Brad,  do you like brunch?

06:10.447 --> 06:12.042
You invited him to brunch?

06:12.057 --> 06:14.473
Yeah, I invited him to brunch.
Why, is that weird?

06:14.486 --> 06:18.353
Yes. That's why I was all,
"You invited him to brunch?"

06:18.368 --> 06:21.973
Why  can't two guys who
are friends go to brunch?

06:21.988 --> 06:24.460
Because brunch is kind of...

06:24.478 --> 06:25.903
Girly.

06:25.916 --> 06:28.390
Girly? Breakfast isn't girly.

06:28.408 --> 06:30.891
Lunch isn't girly.
What makes brunch girly?

06:30.908 --> 06:31.852
I don't know.

06:31.866 --> 06:33.722
There's nothing
girly about a horse.

06:33.736 --> 06:35.543
Nothing girly about a horn,

06:35.555 --> 06:38.240
but put them together
and you get a unicorn.

06:38.855 --> 06:40.630
I don't care what
either of you say,

06:40.646 --> 06:43.950
I am going to The
Popover Pantry with Brad.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.740
We're here. We're hungry.

06:45.757 --> 06:48.183
Get used to it, brunch.

06:53.523 --> 06:56.571
- Hmm... smells delicious.
- Thank you.

06:56.587 --> 06:59.233
There was no food in the fridge,
so I picked up...

06:59.259 --> 07:00.922
What are you doing?

07:00.937 --> 07:02.840
Lily, what was the
first rule again?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.103
Don't change anything.

07:04.116 --> 07:05.880
And what was the second rule?

07:05.895 --> 07:07.673
- There was no second rule.
- Exactly!

07:07.685 --> 07:10.803
There was only one
rule and you broke it.

07:10.815 --> 07:14.151
I bought groceries.
That counts as changing something?

07:14.166 --> 07:16.361
Lily, if I wanted a
fridge full of groceries,

07:16.375 --> 07:18.332
or fresh coffee in the morning,

07:18.346 --> 07:20.542
I'd be in a relationship.

07:21.346 --> 07:25.553
But I don't want to
be in a relationship.

07:25.567 --> 07:28.681
That's why I make it crystal-clear to
every girl that walks through that door

07:28.697 --> 07:30.850
that this is not a place
to leave a toothbrush.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.471
This is not a place to
leave a contact lens case.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.811
This is a place to leave.

07:35.825 --> 07:37.453
Come on, I'll give you a tour.

07:37.465 --> 07:39.433
Uh, no flash
photography, please.

07:40.407 --> 07:42.721
Bienvenido to the bedroom.

07:42.738 --> 07:44.492
Dig this: king-sized bed,

07:44.505 --> 07:46.513
full-sized blanket, one pillow.

07:46.526 --> 07:50.140
Everything about this bed says,
"our work here is done."

07:50.205 --> 07:53.233
Next we say "bienvenue"
to the bathroom.

07:53.245 --> 07:55.383
What, only one towel?

07:55.395 --> 07:56.990
What, no hairdryer?

07:57.005 --> 08:00.360
You know where I keep that stuff?
Your place. Beat it.

08:00.495 --> 08:03.781
And the coup de grace...

08:07.138 --> 08:09.390
Yeah, that's right.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.170
Patent-pending.

08:12.195 --> 08:14.993
And wilkommen to the hallway.

08:15.005 --> 08:17.203
While guys like Ted and
Marshall may hide their porn...

08:17.215 --> 08:18.721
Marshall doesn't have porn.

08:18.737 --> 08:20.520
Aww, that's sweet.

08:20.537 --> 08:22.831
While guys like Ted and
Marshall may hide their porn,

08:22.845 --> 08:26.131
I had mine...
professionally lit.

08:27.185 --> 08:30.670
Girls see this, they can't 
get out of here fast enough.

08:30.688 --> 08:31.943
And if that doesn't
drive them away,

08:31.975 --> 08:34.671
there's always your
life-sized storm-trooper.

08:34.684 --> 08:36.881
No, that's just awesome.

08:36.895 --> 08:39.200
So you see,
whenever a girl wakes up here,

08:39.217 --> 08:41.780
I never have to tell her to go
build her nest somewhere else.

08:41.794 --> 08:44.222
My apartment does it for me.

08:44.778 --> 08:46.942
God, I love brunch.

08:46.955 --> 08:48.492
Oh, damn...

08:48.506 --> 08:50.790
the zucchini bread
is "ridonculous."

08:51.728 --> 08:53.513
This isn't weird, right?

08:53.525 --> 08:54.911
I sort of thought it might be,

08:54.927 --> 08:56.261
but it totally isn't.

08:56.278 --> 08:59.533
And B-T-dub, you totally did
not oversell the eggs Benny.

08:59.546 --> 09:00.511
Right? Right?

09:00.528 --> 09:05.032
I mean, why can't two single bros go out
and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?

09:05.047 --> 09:08.533
Exactly. Thank you,
that's exactly what I've been saying.

09:08.956 --> 09:10.783
This must be destiny.

09:10.796 --> 09:11.981
What are you talking about?

09:11.995 --> 09:14.451
I have two tickets for
Mamma Mia Friday night.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.040
You like Abba, right?

09:16.057 --> 09:17.633
What am I saying? Who doesn't?

09:17.648 --> 09:21.430
Anyway, I was gonna take Kara,
but now it's all you and me.

09:21.446 --> 09:23.960
We're gonna do Broadway, bro style.
What do you say?

09:23.975 --> 09:25.530
Yeah!

09:32.506 --> 09:36.373
Hey. Did the cold wake you?

09:36.388 --> 09:39.650
No, I've just been
watching you sleep.

09:40.326 --> 09:43.622
Oh, did you try and take a shower?
I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.

09:43.638 --> 09:47.632
I  don't buy into the myth that
we need to shower every day.

09:47.707 --> 09:49.483
Okay.

09:50.096 --> 09:53.110
I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't
have any, so you're gonna have to...

09:53.125 --> 09:54.430
I'm boycotting coffee.

09:54.446 --> 09:57.912
You may as well drink the tears
of a Colombian peasant farmer.

09:57.927 --> 10:00.000
God, I love this place.

10:00.018 --> 10:01.573
Good thing I don't have a job

10:01.587 --> 10:04.581
because I could
stay here all day.

10:05.525 --> 10:08.101
I think I left something
on the bookshelf.

10:08.117 --> 10:11.791
Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look.

10:11.808 --> 10:14.671
Oh, I'm disgusting.

10:14.685 --> 10:17.253
Wow, you're open
about your sexuality

10:17.265 --> 10:19.972
and that's one of the
reasons I love you.

10:20.215 --> 10:22.213
Did I just say that?

10:22.226 --> 10:24.902
Oh, well, cat's out of the bag.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.703
I love you.

10:26.717 --> 10:30.900
Whoa, uh... Okay, beep, beep.
Backing up, um...

10:30.917 --> 10:33.381
Hi, Barney. Oh...

10:33.398 --> 10:36.492
Oh, my God. Are you married?
Is this your wife?

10:36.505 --> 10:38.262
What? No.

10:38.276 --> 10:39.960
Yes!

10:39.977 --> 10:42.613
- Yes?
- Yes.

10:42.627 --> 10:44.431
You son of a bitch!

10:44.445 --> 10:47.940
I can't believe I let
you enter my sacred temple.

10:47.955 --> 10:51.603
Come on, baby. Please, no.
Oh, you don't understand.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.662
What have I done? This is the worst.
How could you...?

10:55.478 --> 10:58.390
You're not going anywhere.

11:03.355 --> 11:05.833
Wow, that was close.

11:05.847 --> 11:07.542
That hippie chick
wouldn't leave.

11:07.555 --> 11:09.180
She was ready to squat here.

11:09.197 --> 11:13.021
Well, she'd have to with your
spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?

11:13.036 --> 11:15.812
She was freakishly immune to
everything in my apartment...

11:15.825 --> 11:17.450
except you.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.270
You're better than porn.

11:20.395 --> 11:21.813
Thank you.

11:21.827 --> 11:24.672
How would you like to
extend your stay here?

11:24.685 --> 11:27.003
All you'd have to do is
pretend to be my wife,

11:27.015 --> 11:28.922
and scare off the
occasional one-night stand.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.301
I know, I know. You've got your ethics.
You've got your principles...

11:31.336 --> 11:32.690
I'll do it.

11:32.708 --> 11:33.841
Really?

11:33.857 --> 11:37.643
Barney, you've clearly got
some serious mother issues

11:37.658 --> 11:42.010
that have left you the emotional
equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat.

11:42.026 --> 11:44.143
But, in my other apartment,
I would be living

11:44.158 --> 11:48.343
with an actual scavenging sewer rat,
so you win.

11:48.358 --> 11:50.113
I'll take it.

11:50.755 --> 11:53.620
- Mamma Mia?
- Mamma Mia.

11:53.635 --> 11:56.501
You know what? It's supposed
to be a great musical, okay?

11:56.518 --> 11:58.491
It won all sorts of
Tonys and stuff.

11:58.506 --> 12:02.100
No, totally. It sounds like a really,
really fun, exciting, third date.

12:02.116 --> 12:05.431
Ooh, third date.
You know what that means.

12:06.095 --> 12:07.812
It is not a date, okay.

12:07.826 --> 12:10.781
It's just two bros taking
in a Broadway show.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.843
You bros going to get
dinner beforehand?

12:12.858 --> 12:14.541
We might grab a steak, yeah.

12:14.556 --> 12:16.340
Where at?

12:17.576 --> 12:19.540
Cafe L'Amour.

12:19.896 --> 12:23.071
Brad says the food is
really good there, okay.

12:23.086 --> 12:25.622
Sounds like Brad's got
quite the night planned out.

12:25.637 --> 12:27.040
You better bring your "A" game.

12:27.056 --> 12:29.681
That means no granny panties.

12:29.696 --> 12:31.752
All right, you know what?
You two are just threatened

12:31.786 --> 12:34.480
because I'm a single guy moving
in on your couples' turf.

12:34.496 --> 12:37.280
Well, guess what?
It's my territory now.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.720
I'm peeing all over brunches,
fancy dinners and musicals.

12:40.737 --> 12:44.280
That's  right;
Brad and I are taking back Broadway.

12:44.295 --> 12:45.541
What are you going to wear?

12:45.558 --> 12:47.750
I was thinking like this
collared shirt and these pin...

12:47.786 --> 12:49.440
Oh, you know what? Shut up.

12:50.918 --> 12:53.430
Can you pass the
Arts and Leisure?

12:59.225 --> 13:01.650
Can you pass the
Arts and Leisure?

13:01.668 --> 13:03.360
I just did.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.182
Honey, I'm...

13:05.216 --> 13:09.052
Barney, what the hell
is going on here?

13:09.068 --> 13:10.321
Lily, I can explain...

13:10.337 --> 13:13.252
How could you? In our own home?

13:13.266 --> 13:14.952
You bastard!

13:14.967 --> 13:17.762
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know he had...
- Just get out.

13:17.778 --> 13:21.243
This is what I get after I worked
as a stripper for four years

13:21.256 --> 13:23.390
to put you through
medical school?

13:23.408 --> 13:25.650
I got breast implants for you.

13:25.668 --> 13:29.810
I... I was just about
to turn on the tears.

13:30.236 --> 13:32.320
Brava.

13:32.337 --> 13:34.551
That was incredible.

13:34.567 --> 13:37.821
And that slap was genius.
You did not hold back.

13:37.847 --> 13:40.470
Yeah, that I just
always wanted to do.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.950
Fair enough.

13:42.336 --> 13:43.590
I have to say,

13:43.607 --> 13:46.122
it's kind of nice having food
around here for a change.

13:46.136 --> 13:47.423
You know...

13:47.437 --> 13:49.290
nah, never mind.

13:49.308 --> 13:50.371
What?

13:50.387 --> 13:52.721
You're my wife.
You can tell me anything.

13:52.797 --> 13:55.531
Well, if you really
wanted to sell this ruse,

13:55.545 --> 13:58.653
we should try to make this
place a little more...

13:58.668 --> 13:59.890
you know, homey.

13:59.905 --> 14:02.483
Like-like a woman would
actually live here.

14:02.495 --> 14:04.573
What did you have in mind?

14:13.178 --> 14:16.601
# Bones, bones,
brittle little bones #

14:16.616 --> 14:18.800
# It's not the milk you seek #

14:18.817 --> 14:21.582
# It's the sun you need #

14:21.667 --> 14:26.602
# Sugar dumpling, muffin baby #

14:26.615 --> 14:31.051
# This world is going crazy #

14:31.068 --> 14:32.842
# Do do do do #

14:32.895 --> 14:35.173
# Do do do do #

14:35.186 --> 14:38.462
# Do do do do do #

14:40.238 --> 14:41.692
Hey, you're home.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.790
I didn't think we'd be seeing
you until tomorrow morning.

14:43.827 --> 14:47.030
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
It wasn't a date.

14:48.268 --> 14:51.461
Okay, it was a date
and it got way weird.

14:54.846 --> 14:56.620
Oh, you really don't
have to do that.

14:56.635 --> 14:59.321
No, I insist. You're my guest.

14:59.456 --> 15:01.001
Thanks, Brad.

15:01.766 --> 15:03.491
Bro,

15:03.507 --> 15:06.010
you got some chocolate
on your chin.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.621
Still there.

15:09.636 --> 15:11.490
I'll get that bad boy.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.362
Whoa.

15:16.376 --> 15:17.903
Well, it could have been worse.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.180
It could have
fallen in your lap.

15:22.118 --> 15:23.770
It gets worse.

15:23.785 --> 15:26.971
No, I-I can do it, Brad.
Okay, thank you.

15:27.965 --> 15:30.471
So anyway, ah,
it's this Saturday.

15:30.486 --> 15:32.160
Do you want to come?

15:32.916 --> 15:35.792
You want me to go to
a wedding with you?

15:36.346 --> 15:38.681
Okay, that's not too bad.

15:38.696 --> 15:41.490
Two single guys on the prowl.
It'll be like Wedding Crashers.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.531
Just keep Brad away
from the bouquet.

15:46.036 --> 15:47.972
It gets worse.

15:47.985 --> 15:49.372
It gets better.

15:49.385 --> 15:52.743
The foliage in Vermont this
time of year is ridonc.

15:52.755 --> 15:53.721
Vermont?

15:53.735 --> 15:56.490
Yeah, the wedding's
at this awesome B&B.

15:56.505 --> 15:58.661
Kara and I used to go there.

15:58.675 --> 16:01.641
Anyway, there is one room left,
and we got it.

16:01.655 --> 16:03.923
Walt Whitman Suite, bro.

16:08.108 --> 16:09.873
You said no, right?

16:09.887 --> 16:11.271
Of course.

16:11.288 --> 16:12.662
I understand.

16:12.675 --> 16:13.932
It's cool.

16:13.948 --> 16:16.460
It's the first time I was
going to see my college friends

16:16.476 --> 16:18.572
since Kara left me.

16:18.587 --> 16:20.223
I just...

16:21.967 --> 16:24.263
I just miss her so much.

16:27.986 --> 16:30.151
I'll go to Vermont with you.

16:30.917 --> 16:32.811
That's great!

16:33.118 --> 16:35.020
You know, uh,
they're registered at Pottery Barn.

16:35.056 --> 16:38.173
I figure we could go
halfsies on a gravy boat.

16:41.898 --> 16:45.102
I'm sorry.
It's not funny anymore.

16:45.117 --> 16:47.162
Damn you, brunch!

16:47.957 --> 16:49.602
This guy's crazy, right?

16:49.617 --> 16:51.740
Look, I don't think he's crazy.

16:51.758 --> 16:55.252
I just think he's suffering from a
severe case of girlfriend withdrawal.

16:55.266 --> 16:57.980
And unfortunately,
you're his nicotine patch.

16:57.996 --> 17:02.032
And now you have to do what every
dysfunctional couple has to do:

17:02.048 --> 17:03.122
break up.

17:03.138 --> 17:04.492
You're right. You're right.
I promised Brad

17:04.528 --> 17:06.982
I would go to the wedding with him,
and then that is it.

17:06.998 --> 17:08.502
Good man.

17:09.167 --> 17:11.731
Oh, I think we made
the right decision

17:11.746 --> 17:14.032
going for the custom-made
Italian sheets.

17:14.045 --> 17:17.642
Hey, if my bed's going suit up,
it's going to do it right.

17:17.656 --> 17:19.700
Want to give it a whirl?

17:23.635 --> 17:26.330
All right, I'm going to head out,
hit the bars.

17:26.345 --> 17:27.813
What are you going
to do tonight?

17:27.825 --> 17:31.761
Oh, I was just going to watch Letterman
but, God this bed is so comfy.

17:31.777 --> 17:34.261
I wish you had a TV in here.

17:38.448 --> 17:41.873
Okay, seriously,
what do you do for a living?

17:41.887 --> 17:43.431
Please.

17:46.257 --> 17:47.842
I thought you were going out.

17:47.856 --> 17:48.950
Eh.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.952
After the monologue.

17:51.518 --> 17:54.290
The next morning,
as the sun rose over Manhattan,

17:54.307 --> 17:56.391
your Uncle Marshall headed
over to Brad's apartment

17:56.405 --> 17:58.463
to leave for the
wedding in Vermont.

17:58.475 --> 18:00.191
But when he got there...

18:00.208 --> 18:01.490
No.

18:01.895 --> 18:03.603
No...

18:05.116 --> 18:06.520
No.

18:07.006 --> 18:08.860
No!

18:09.358 --> 18:11.012
No.

18:15.457 --> 18:16.603
Ted.

18:16.616 --> 18:19.483
Um, Brad got me flowers.

18:19.495 --> 18:20.872
Hold on.

18:20.937 --> 18:23.043
Brad  got him flowers.

18:23.696 --> 18:26.921
I'm sorry.
It just got funny again.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.372
- Oh, hey...
- No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it.

18:32.387 --> 18:35.452
I do like you. And calla lilies 
are my favorite flower.

18:35.465 --> 18:38.091
I don't know how you knew that.
I guess you just get me,

18:38.107 --> 18:40.920
but this is not cool, man.
I can't believe that you would...

18:40.938 --> 18:44.061
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

18:48.047 --> 18:50.981
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hi, Kara.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.381
So you guys, are like,
back together now?

18:53.397 --> 18:56.063
Yeah. Happened last night.

18:57.756 --> 18:59.903
Uh, I'm sorry, bro.

18:59.915 --> 19:01.872
- I should have called you.
- Yeah, you should have.

19:01.907 --> 19:04.212
- Well, I didn't mean to hurt...
- Don't, Brad.

19:06.517 --> 19:08.452
Just don't.

19:08.555 --> 19:11.741
# There was something #
# in the air that night #

19:11.757 --> 19:14.082
# The stars went bright #

19:14.098 --> 19:16.692
Oh, what was with him?

19:16.708 --> 19:18.551
I don't know.

19:18.955 --> 19:21.180
I think he's in love with me.

19:22.576 --> 19:24.642
# Fernando #

19:33.177 --> 19:36.272
I can't believe we just...
you and I...

19:36.287 --> 19:37.790
- what have we done?
- Nothing.

19:37.806 --> 19:41.252
Nothing happened.
We-we just went to sleep.

19:41.268 --> 19:44.012
Just went to sleep? I don't sleep 
in the same bed as a woman

19:44.028 --> 19:46.222
and not make a move.

19:46.236 --> 19:48.853
How could... You.

19:48.868 --> 19:51.851
You spooned me against my will.

19:51.866 --> 19:54.192
Hey, it takes two to cuddle.

19:54.208 --> 19:55.642
We...

19:56.915 --> 19:58.150
We...

19:58.167 --> 20:00.912
We redecorated my place.

20:00.926 --> 20:05.232
We stayed in on a Friday
night to watch Letterman,

20:05.246 --> 20:07.471
and then slept together
and didn't have sex?

20:07.486 --> 20:11.033
Oh, my God,
we're in a relationship.

20:11.317 --> 20:14.313
That's what you think
a relationship is?

20:14.327 --> 20:15.771
You were supposed
to be the vaccine,

20:15.786 --> 20:19.183
but you gave me the disease.
You gotta go.

20:19.576 --> 20:21.442
Barney.

20:22.035 --> 20:25.832
I don't think you're mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.

20:25.848 --> 20:29.233
You let down your guard,
and let someone into your life,

20:29.246 --> 20:32.731
and-and it actually felt okay.

20:33.378 --> 20:36.022
And that terrifies you.

20:36.038 --> 20:38.501
Uh-huh. You gotta go.

20:38.525 --> 20:42.071
Hey, you can't just kick me out!
I put a lot of work into this place,

20:42.087 --> 20:45.311
and I've grown accustomed to
a certain standard of living.

20:45.326 --> 20:48.170
A certain standard of living?
You didn't pay a single...

20:48.188 --> 20:51.241
And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, 
after two weeks of marriage,

20:51.257 --> 20:52.992
decided to call it quits.

20:53.005 --> 20:55.161
Fortunately, they
reached a settlement.

20:55.177 --> 20:59.751
And that's the story of how Aunt
Lily furnished her apartment.

21:02.487 --> 21:05.182
Marshall ran into Brad
again some time later.

21:05.196 --> 21:06.902
Oh, my God, it's Brad.

21:06.916 --> 21:08.872
Laugh like I said
something really funny.

21:08.888 --> 21:10.710
Right, right.

21:10.728 --> 21:11.562
Hey, Marshall.

21:11.577 --> 21:13.153
Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?

21:13.168 --> 21:14.592
It's good.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.301
- Hey, I'm, uh...
- Yeah, I know who you are.

21:18.178 --> 21:20.173
Well, I got to go.
I got this thing.

21:20.185 --> 21:22.141
Yeah, me too,
but more important.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.722
So, I guess I'll
see you around.

21:23.737 --> 21:26.272
Sure. Sure.

21:29.865 --> 21:32.543
Even if you don't believe it,
tell me he looks fat.

21:32.557 --> 21:33.843
Totally looks fat.
