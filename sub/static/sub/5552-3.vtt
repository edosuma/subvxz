00:02.170 --> 00:03.755
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.922 --> 00:06.341
Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor.

00:07.509 --> 00:10.804
<i>Six criminally-insane inmates
busted out of Arkham Asylum.</i>

00:12.722 --> 00:14.307
<i>They want mass panic.</i>

00:18.603 --> 00:20.105
Hello, Jim. How do I look?

00:21.022 --> 00:22.023
Barbara!

00:22.691 --> 00:24.234
- Yo, Commish.
- Yeah.

00:26.945 --> 00:28.196
Don't move.

00:29.948 --> 00:31.574
You should probably
get back to work.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.785
Who knows what went wrong
while you were gone.

00:34.452 --> 00:37.080
It's a new day, Jim.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.269
Jerome Valeska.

00:59.728 --> 01:01.938
The attack on the G.C.P.D.

01:03.732 --> 01:05.316
Someone on the streets is talking.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.318
Somebody knows something.

01:07.485 --> 01:09.988
Valeska has red hair. Crazy laugh.

01:10.155 --> 01:12.115
Might be rolling with the blonde number.

01:12.323 --> 01:14.409
I don't know anything. Honest.

01:14.701 --> 01:15.994
- You believe him?
- Nope.

01:16.161 --> 01:17.412
Me neither.

01:19.330 --> 01:20.498
It's the truth!

01:20.665 --> 01:22.167
But, hey, I can help you guys.

01:22.333 --> 01:25.336
- You know, spread the word and stuff.
- Valeska killed a friend of ours.

01:26.671 --> 01:29.924
Anybody hides him, anybody protects him,
they go down, too.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.426
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:31.593 --> 01:33.720
- Now spread the word.
- No. No!

01:51.988 --> 01:53.406
<i>Sneaking out?</i>

01:54.240 --> 01:55.617
Just like a guy.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.369
There are loose ends that need tying.

01:59.496 --> 02:00.663
Need this?

02:11.382 --> 02:12.801
Bring back bagels.

02:13.009 --> 02:14.427
<i>No need for that.</i>

02:14.969 --> 02:17.722
I thought Miss Kean and I could have
a little chat. Good morning.

02:18.890 --> 02:20.517
Jerome's waiting outside.

02:21.518 --> 02:23.353
<i>Try and keep him focused.</i>

02:37.575 --> 02:38.785
You be nice.

02:41.830 --> 02:43.581
You two seem to be getting along.

02:43.748 --> 02:45.041
I'm so glad.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.584
She needs a friend.

02:47.669 --> 02:50.463
My sister is a very special person.

02:52.423 --> 02:55.885
She seems so strong,
but yet she's quite fragile. Sugar?

02:56.261 --> 02:57.387
Sure.

02:58.137 --> 03:03.226
You acquitted yourself very well
at the adventure at the G.C.P.D.

03:03.434 --> 03:06.354
Jim Gordon escaped the carnage unscathed.

03:07.272 --> 03:09.148
- Top marks.
- Thank you.

03:12.110 --> 03:13.778
Did you know my family built this city?

03:15.780 --> 03:18.283
We carved the bedrock
upon which it stands.

03:18.449 --> 03:22.537
But there is not a bridge, an alley,
a ditch that carries our name.

03:23.788 --> 03:27.083
My forefathers were betrayed.
Their legacy erased.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.836
And I am here to punish those
who wronged us,

03:30.003 --> 03:32.005
and reclaim what is ours.

03:34.674 --> 03:35.925
Strawberry?

03:37.844 --> 03:39.137
I didn't ask.

03:39.304 --> 03:42.557
So you're gonna take over Gotham
by unleashing a bunch of loonies.

03:42.724 --> 03:43.808
Awesome plan.

03:43.975 --> 03:45.393
That's only part one.

03:46.102 --> 03:48.605
- So what's the second part?
- Oh, you're gonna love it.

03:48.771 --> 03:50.398
There's a starring role for you.

03:50.690 --> 03:54.152
You'll be famous and powerful.
And your fondest dream will come true.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.779
You know my dreams, do you?

03:57.989 --> 04:00.158
When Jim Gordon has
outlived his usefulness,

04:00.325 --> 04:02.118
I'm gonna help you destroy him.

04:02.368 --> 04:03.536
<i>Not kill him.</i>

04:04.245 --> 04:05.997
<i>Destroy him.</i>

04:06.956 --> 04:09.042
Body and soul.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.923
<i>Bang</i>.

04:15.131 --> 04:16.507
<i>Shocking images.</i>

04:16.674 --> 04:18.176
<i>Gotham is on high alert today after--</i>

04:18.343 --> 04:19.510
Look,
I'm just saying, I'll chuck mopes

04:19.677 --> 04:21.179
out of windows
until the cows come home,

04:21.346 --> 04:23.264
but at some point,
we gotta go see Penguin.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.434
Why would he break Jerome out of Arkham?
Or attack the G.C.P.D.?

04:26.601 --> 04:28.394
He wouldn't.
But that weasel's running things now.

04:28.561 --> 04:30.396
- If there's chatter, he'd know it.
- I'll think about it.

04:30.563 --> 04:32.190
- Jim--
- I'll think about it.

04:32.357 --> 04:34.525
Alvarez, where are you with
Jerome's circus contacts?

04:34.692 --> 04:36.903
- Circus is upstate. I'm just waiting--
- Follow up.

04:37.070 --> 04:38.112
His father's probably with him.

04:38.279 --> 04:41.199
He covered for him once before.
He might have some information. Do it.

04:41.532 --> 04:44.786
You, Detective.
Which escapee are you tracking?

04:44.953 --> 04:46.037
Helzinger. No one's seen him.

04:46.204 --> 04:48.706
He's 6'7", two-seventy-five
with the mind of a five-year-old.

04:48.873 --> 04:50.291
Somebody's seen him.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.586
Hey!

04:54.045 --> 04:55.213
What are you doing?

04:55.713 --> 04:58.091
That stays up until we have her killer
in custody, you understand?

04:58.257 --> 04:59.425
Yes, sir.

05:03.846 --> 05:07.475
Sarah Essen and nine of your brothers
were killed in this house.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.268
In our house.

05:10.561 --> 05:13.856
Their murderer stood right there
and he laughed at us.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.151
Never forget that.

05:21.239 --> 05:22.699
What?

05:24.784 --> 05:26.244
- So how are you?
- I'm fine.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.329
Really?

05:31.416 --> 05:32.792
Look, I know Essen was your friend.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.502
Lee, whatever you're about to say,

05:34.669 --> 05:37.672
I know it's coming from a good place,
but I can't hear it right now.

05:42.468 --> 05:45.388
So, the Gotham Children's Hospital gala
is tonight,

05:45.555 --> 05:47.223
which I helped organize.

05:47.765 --> 05:48.850
I can't.

05:49.434 --> 05:50.852
- You can't go?
- No.

05:51.686 --> 05:54.188
Even though a few hours away
from all of this might actually help.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.440
Lee.

05:55.857 --> 05:56.858
Okay.

05:57.108 --> 05:58.985
I just have to tell you something,
because if I don't

05:59.152 --> 06:01.362
and you find out, you're gonna be pissed.

06:02.822 --> 06:04.365
There's gonna be a magician.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.540
Yeah, you're right.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.419
- Stop beating yourself up.
- I'm trying.

06:16.586 --> 06:19.047
- I know you are.
- I should have been here. I wasn't.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.465
Stop it.

06:21.174 --> 06:22.425
Kiss me.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.470
Kiss me.

06:32.977 --> 06:34.020
Better?

06:42.487 --> 06:44.822
Not to interrupt your
weirdly-timed make-out session,

06:45.114 --> 06:47.283
<i>but Alvarez got in touch
with the circus manager.</i>

06:47.450 --> 06:50.036
The blind fortune teller,
Jerome's dad, bailed on him.

06:50.203 --> 06:52.121
Stayed in town. Got an address.

06:53.915 --> 06:55.541
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

07:13.935 --> 07:15.144
Who's there?

07:18.064 --> 07:20.191
I know someone's there.

07:23.027 --> 07:24.529
Hiya, Pops.

07:24.946 --> 07:27.907
Long time, no see.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.001
<i>So, how you doing?</i>

07:40.586 --> 07:42.213
Ah, silent treatment, eh?

07:42.421 --> 07:44.841
Here, I'll tell you a story.

07:45.550 --> 07:46.551
Ah.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.178
You remember Kansas City, Dad?

07:49.554 --> 07:54.684
The circus went through town every spring,
right around my birthday.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.938
There was this guy.

07:59.313 --> 08:03.151
Him and my mom used to drink and fornicate

08:03.317 --> 08:05.278
and beat the crap out of me.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.363
<i>They would make a whole night out of it.</i>

08:07.905 --> 08:09.740
And I remember one time.

08:10.950 --> 08:13.077
It was my ninth birthday.

08:13.619 --> 08:18.583
Him and my mom had just finished round one
of boozing, boning, beating up Jerome,

08:18.749 --> 08:20.751
and were deciding to take a little break.

08:21.294 --> 08:22.753
Anyway, hmm,

08:25.381 --> 08:28.134
I was outside the trailer,
and you were there.

08:28.801 --> 08:30.595
And you said,

08:31.262 --> 08:33.431
"Why are you crying, Jerome?"

08:35.433 --> 08:36.934
"It's my birthday,

08:37.393 --> 08:39.687
"and my mom and the snake guy
are beating me."

08:39.979 --> 08:41.272
And then you said,

08:41.439 --> 08:46.277
"This world doesn't care about you
or anyone else, Jerome.

08:46.861 --> 08:49.530
"Better to realize that now."

08:52.450 --> 08:53.618
And that was it.

08:54.827 --> 08:57.288
Well, you see, there's this guy, Dad.

08:57.455 --> 09:00.166
He believes in me.
He thinks I'm gonna be a star.

09:00.333 --> 09:04.503
And tonight,
all of Gotham will see that, too.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.841
Except for you, 'cause you'll be,
you know, dead.

09:09.008 --> 09:10.509
- Jerome--
- Oh, is this the part where you say

09:10.676 --> 09:12.929
how sorry you are? Hmm?

09:13.512 --> 09:14.639
How you should have believed in me?

09:14.805 --> 09:16.641
How it's not too late to start again?

09:16.807 --> 09:19.060
News flash, Dad, it's too late.

09:19.227 --> 09:21.103
You don't have to do this.

09:22.313 --> 09:24.899
No. I'm pretty sure I do.

09:25.608 --> 09:28.194
I was a bad father. But I did love you.

09:28.653 --> 09:30.363
To kill me for that--

09:34.992 --> 09:37.328
It's not why I'm gonna kill you.

09:39.497 --> 09:41.207
Plans to Arkham Asylum.

09:42.375 --> 09:43.376
And look at these.

09:46.671 --> 09:49.006
Letters between you and your troubled son.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.133
Innocent at first glance,
but Detective Gordon--

09:51.300 --> 09:52.593
You remember him, right?

09:52.760 --> 09:55.930
He'll feel little bumps,

09:56.472 --> 09:58.975
a secret message written in braille

09:59.141 --> 10:02.520
between you and your son
discussing my escape.

10:05.189 --> 10:08.442
Finally, the knockout gas
used to disable the orderlies.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.945
'Cause you see, Dad,

10:11.612 --> 10:13.531
this guy I was telling you about,

10:14.699 --> 10:16.742
he's the one who broke me out of Arkham.

10:17.535 --> 10:19.870
He doesn't want anyone to
know about that, obviously.

10:20.037 --> 10:24.625
So, the police will find
these letters. Hmm.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.211
They'll think,

10:27.628 --> 10:30.715
"The blind old fool really loved his son.

10:30.881 --> 10:33.718
"What a wonderful father."

10:33.968 --> 10:36.387
There won't be a dry eye in the house.

10:36.554 --> 10:38.597
They'll never believe it.

10:38.764 --> 10:41.726
Ah, sure they will. Cops are dumb.

10:42.143 --> 10:44.812
There's nothing to eat in this dump.
Finish up and let's go.

10:44.979 --> 10:47.398
Sorry you're gonna miss my big night, Dad.

10:48.524 --> 10:51.193
But, hey, you're psychic,

10:51.444 --> 10:53.738
so tell me, do I kill?

10:55.031 --> 10:58.701
You will be a curse upon Gotham.

10:58.951 --> 11:03.622
Children will wake from sleep,
screaming at the thought of you.

11:03.914 --> 11:08.794
Your legacy will be death and madness.

11:15.885 --> 11:19.013
Well, say hi to Mom for me.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.516
<i>G.C.P.D.</i>

11:29.398 --> 11:30.816
G.C.P.D.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.277
Mr. Cicero, it's Detective Gordon.

11:33.611 --> 11:35.613
We need to speak with you about your son.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.283
Mr. Cicero?

11:41.243 --> 11:42.495
Mr. Cicero?

11:50.294 --> 11:51.754
Harvey. Window.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.143
Harvey.

12:24.495 --> 12:27.123
Detective Gordon, old pal,

12:27.289 --> 12:29.750
that gas sure packs a wallop, huh?

12:31.502 --> 12:32.962
That's cute.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.637
I'm sensing anger.

12:41.804 --> 12:46.517
You killed Sarah Essen,
now I'm gonna kill you.

12:46.976 --> 12:48.185
Mmm-mmm.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.896
Don't shoot him.

12:54.066 --> 12:56.318
How about a little flesh wound?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.362
<i>No, no.</i>

12:58.654 --> 13:00.906
My dibs.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.386
This is a waste of time.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.389
We had a deal, didn't we, Master Bruce?

13:26.140 --> 13:28.434
Part of which was
you resuming a normal lifestyle.

13:28.726 --> 13:31.061
Your parents were both patrons
to the Children's Hospital,

13:31.228 --> 13:33.772
therefore, it makes you a patron.

13:35.107 --> 13:38.527
Besides, there's gonna be a magician.

13:39.904 --> 13:41.572
And you like magicians, don't you?

13:42.740 --> 13:43.949
No, I don't.

13:44.825 --> 13:45.993
I hate magicians.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.245
You know what I said about being normal?

13:48.496 --> 13:49.872
Excuse me.

13:50.581 --> 13:51.916
I'm Lee Thompkins.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.084
I work with James Gordon.
He's mentioned you.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.295
- I saw you and thought--
- Of course.

13:56.587 --> 13:57.963
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.882
This is my guardian, Alfred Pennyworth.

14:00.049 --> 14:01.842
- It's an absolute pleasure.
- Thank you.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.095
How is Detective Gordon doing
since the attack on the precinct?

14:05.596 --> 14:07.056
<i>I was thinking I should call him.</i>

14:07.223 --> 14:08.432
He'd appreciate that.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.439
Can I get you
something to drink?

14:15.606 --> 14:17.274
Uh, just water. Thank you.

14:20.694 --> 14:24.949
So, I hear there's gonna be a magician.

14:38.295 --> 14:39.463
Hello, Selina.

14:40.381 --> 14:41.549
Hey.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.426
I didn't expect
to see you here.

14:45.553 --> 14:48.556
Well, you wanna steal stuff,
it helps to go where the rich people are.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.935
You do know this is a benefit
for Children's Hospital.

14:53.394 --> 14:54.436
So?

14:54.603 --> 14:56.397
So these people are here for a good cause.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.482
Me eating is a good cause.

14:59.984 --> 15:02.069
Besides, didn't I steal something
for you once?

15:04.029 --> 15:05.364
Selina, that was different.

15:05.656 --> 15:06.657
Right.

15:08.284 --> 15:09.410
How'd that go?

15:10.202 --> 15:11.495
You get into that guy's safe?

15:12.329 --> 15:15.541
Yes. Though things didn't turn out
quite like I planned.

15:17.543 --> 15:18.961
A lot's happened since then.

15:24.675 --> 15:28.846
- Alfred says there's gonna be a magician.
- I'm working, and hate magicians.

15:31.432 --> 15:32.850
See you around, Bruce.

15:44.403 --> 15:46.280
So, you wanna share your plan?

15:47.906 --> 15:51.535
Remember I told you I could divine a thing
a person truly wants?

15:52.202 --> 15:54.121
What Gotham wants is a hero.

15:55.414 --> 15:58.876
And tonight, I'm going to give them one.

15:59.752 --> 16:02.546
Shall we? Jerome and Tabby went on ahead.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.381
Great cape.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.761
Thank you for filling in
on such short notice.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.388
But how did you hear
our magician dropped out, Mr...

16:11.555 --> 16:12.848
Rudolpho.

16:13.557 --> 16:15.726
Well, you know, magic.

16:17.353 --> 16:19.229
Oh, I won't be needing that.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.197
- Come on.
- I'm sorry,

16:28.364 --> 16:30.699
but really there is no mystery.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.703
Tabitha, have you met Deputy Mayor Kane?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.997
Harrison, this is my Tabith.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.707
Ah, nice to meet you.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.959
Oh, and could you please tell your brother

16:41.126 --> 16:43.170
that when a handsome billionaire
appears out of nowhere,

16:43.337 --> 16:44.588
<i>people get curious?</i>

16:44.755 --> 16:47.174
"Where'd he come from?
How'd he make his money?

16:47.341 --> 16:48.676
"Who's he dating?"

16:48.842 --> 16:51.970
My wife would kill me if I don't
get something. A tidbit.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.599
He's a monster in the sack.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.771
Do you have any news of Mayor James?

17:02.606 --> 17:06.276
No, no. It's a real mystery.
We don't know where he is.

17:06.610 --> 17:08.612
How intriguing.

17:08.821 --> 17:11.407
Harrison, would you mind?
A little family business.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.450
Of course. Miss Galavan.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.497
Everything's ready.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.582
See you at home.

17:25.963 --> 17:29.133
So how do you go from being
in the Royal Marines to a butler?

17:29.299 --> 17:30.968
Well, it's a bit tedious,
really, after a while.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.804
You know, parachuting into
one global hot spot after another,

17:33.971 --> 17:36.515
warlords putting ridiculous bounties
on your head.

17:36.724 --> 17:38.225
Gets a bit boring, really.

17:38.392 --> 17:39.977
You have amazing stories.

17:40.144 --> 17:41.812
Yeah, well, you know, one or two.

17:43.814 --> 17:46.233
You know, I don't really get nights off,

17:46.400 --> 17:47.651
but if ever you'd like to

17:47.818 --> 17:50.571
pop by Wayne Manor
for dinner one evening, I'd--

17:50.738 --> 17:52.489
Oh, that's very kind of you,
Mr. Pennyworth.

17:52.656 --> 17:55.993
No. "Alfred." Please, "Alfred."

17:56.243 --> 17:58.620
Alfred, that's very kind of you, but--

17:58.787 --> 18:01.039
Now having said that,
I don't see why I can't take a night off.

18:01.206 --> 18:05.419
And I... I happen to know
the head chef at Chez Parnasse.

18:05.586 --> 18:09.006
Well, I'm afraid, I--
Did you say Chez Parnasse?

18:10.340 --> 18:12.176
I've been trying to eat there
for quite some time.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.221
You have the most beautiful eyes.

18:17.347 --> 18:20.017
Oh, wow. Okay, look--
Thank you, but, uh...

18:20.309 --> 18:21.477
Alfred, I'd like to leave.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.854
Yeah, um...

18:24.313 --> 18:25.773
What about Dr. Thompkins' water?

18:25.939 --> 18:27.941
And, of course,
you're gonna miss the magician.

18:28.692 --> 18:30.486
Sorry, I must have forgotten your water.

18:30.652 --> 18:31.737
Alfred, I still want to leave.

18:31.904 --> 18:34.573
- Are you not feeling well?
- No, no, he's abso-- He's absolutely fine.

18:34.740 --> 18:37.618
He's fine. Why don't you just
pop off to the bar, Master Bruce, and...

18:37.785 --> 18:39.244
Show's about to start, Miss Thompkins.

18:39.495 --> 18:41.038
Is it time?

18:41.205 --> 18:43.665
I've roped myself into emcee duties
for the night.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.501
I hope you'll stay for the show.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.377
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.512
What?

19:01.350 --> 19:02.518
<i>Good evening.</i>

19:03.936 --> 19:05.896
<i>I am Dr. Lee Thompkins.</i>

19:06.605 --> 19:07.856
<i>For the past five years,</i>

19:08.023 --> 19:11.068
<i>I've had the honor of being part
of the Children's Hospital.</i>

19:11.443 --> 19:12.903
<i>Thank you for your support,</i>

19:13.070 --> 19:14.947
<i>and thank you so much
for coming out tonight.</i>

19:15.447 --> 19:16.573
<i>Over the years,</i>

19:16.740 --> 19:19.201
<i>we've had magicians
come and entertain our children.</i>

19:19.910 --> 19:22.746
<i>And so tonight,
we have one of the magicians here for you.</i>

19:23.413 --> 19:24.832
<i>Without further ado,</i>

19:24.998 --> 19:27.709
<i>please allow me to present to you</i>

19:27.876 --> 19:29.837
<i>the Great Rudolpho.</i>

19:50.858 --> 19:51.859
Ha!

19:59.741 --> 20:02.452
Greetings, ladies and germs.

20:02.619 --> 20:05.789
I am indeed the Great Rudolpho.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.836
Please ogle my lovely assistant.

20:11.086 --> 20:12.087
<i>Ooh!</i>

20:44.161 --> 20:45.537
<i>For my first act,</i>

20:45.704 --> 20:47.956
<i>I'll require a volunteer.</i>

20:48.790 --> 20:50.208
<i>Let me see...</i>

20:51.460 --> 20:54.630
<i>Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck,</i>

20:55.005 --> 20:56.214
<i>goose.</i>

20:56.381 --> 20:57.841
<i>Who's the goose?</i>

21:04.181 --> 21:06.725
Go on, Master Bruce. Be a sport.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.521
Don't keep the lady waiting.

21:15.525 --> 21:16.902
Fine.

21:24.368 --> 21:27.537
Hello, young man. Please.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.550
Does this handsome gentleman have a name?

21:40.717 --> 21:41.718
Bruce.

21:41.885 --> 21:42.886
Bruce!

21:45.013 --> 21:47.683
Well, Bruce, this won't hurt a bit.

21:49.393 --> 21:52.813
Is there a doctor in the house?

21:53.105 --> 21:57.192
No, just, excuse--
Just wait, wait, wait one second.

22:02.948 --> 22:04.324
Go home.

22:06.118 --> 22:07.411
I'm fine.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.912
Been running this since last night,

22:09.079 --> 22:11.081
and you got a face full of that gas.
Go home.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.125
You going home?

22:14.751 --> 22:16.044
I didn't think so.

22:21.675 --> 22:24.261
- Maybe I will go get some sleep.
- Yeah? Good idea.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.013
But we got somewhere, right?

22:26.555 --> 22:28.890
At least now we know
who broke Jerome out of Arkham.

22:29.057 --> 22:32.019
Yeah, crazy old blind man
that lived alone.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.439
A clever crazy old blind man.

22:35.856 --> 22:38.942
If his father broke him out,
why'd Jerome kill him, huh?

22:39.568 --> 22:42.362
He was probably planning this
Maniax shtick since you sent him away.

22:42.571 --> 22:43.947
He was just a kid.

22:44.281 --> 22:47.492
Every evil bastard in the world
was just a kid once.

22:49.786 --> 22:50.912
Yeah.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.957
But I don't think it was his father
that broke him out.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.086
Cool. Back to square one.

22:59.171 --> 23:01.214
You're right, I will go
and get some sleep.

23:01.673 --> 23:04.801
For the record, I knew Essen
a hell of a lot longer than you.

23:05.343 --> 23:07.304
<i>She saved my ass hundreds of times.</i>

23:08.305 --> 23:09.681
You really should go home.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.560
First thing tomorrow,
we'll go see Penguin.

23:14.895 --> 23:17.689
You're right,
he's got his ears on the street.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.234
Jim.

23:24.154 --> 23:25.322
Never mind.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.741
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.669
Give them a wave.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.394
<i>Some people say
Bruce has a split personality.</i>

24:02.275 --> 24:03.610
- Very good, Master Bruce.
- Mmm.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.492
<i>For my next illusion,</i>

24:10.659 --> 24:12.702
<i>I'd like to call to the stage</i>

24:12.869 --> 24:16.873
<i>esteemed Deputy Mayor Harrison Kane.</i>

24:23.547 --> 24:26.424
Is there something familiar to you
about those two?

24:38.103 --> 24:39.646
Oh, my God.

24:50.407 --> 24:52.993
- Lee, I was just ab--
- Jim, it's Barbara. She's here.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.412
And I think maybe Jerome--

25:09.092 --> 25:13.889
By the way,
nobody here is getting out alive.

25:15.599 --> 25:16.850
<i>Really?</i>

25:23.607 --> 25:25.442
- He's really...
- Oh, my God!

25:25.817 --> 25:26.818
Whoo!

25:31.364 --> 25:32.574
All right, Master Bruce, time to leave.

25:32.782 --> 25:33.950
Ta-da!

25:46.213 --> 25:47.214
Don't shoot!

25:59.517 --> 26:01.353
- Selina!
- Bruce!

26:26.586 --> 26:27.796
You!

26:28.713 --> 26:30.173
- What's going on?
- Hostage situation.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.133
The magician just killed the Deputy Mayor.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.846
It's Jerome Valeska. The same man
that killed Commissioner Essen.

26:37.097 --> 26:39.641
- Who's in charge here?
- I guess you are.

26:44.980 --> 26:46.815
Lee, thank God. I've been--

26:46.982 --> 26:49.067
<i>Sorry, Jimbo,
it's just little old me.</i>

26:50.527 --> 26:51.528
<i>Jerome.</i>

26:51.695 --> 26:53.196
Are you outside?

26:53.363 --> 26:56.116
You are, aren't you?
Oh, goody.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.201
I swear to God, if you've hurt her--

26:58.368 --> 27:02.247
<i>Breathe, James. I haven't touched
a hair on your girlfriend's pretty head.</i>

27:02.414 --> 27:03.707
<i>See for yourself.</i>

27:04.416 --> 27:07.210
<i>This is live television,
after all</i>.

27:07.377 --> 27:10.380
However, the police are here.
They are trying to...

27:18.722 --> 27:20.056
- The feed just came back.
<i>- Ooh!</i>

27:23.893 --> 27:24.978
You son of a bitch.

27:25.145 --> 27:27.105
<i>True. But not the point.</i>

27:27.272 --> 27:28.982
<i>Hey, let's talk about what I want.</i>

27:29.524 --> 27:30.817
<i>Excuse me</i>.

27:32.944 --> 27:34.487
<i>$47,000,000,</i>

27:34.654 --> 27:36.114
<i>a helicopter, obviously,</i>

27:36.281 --> 27:39.409
<i>the dry cleaning I left at Mr. Chang's,
be careful, the man is a crook,</i>

27:39.576 --> 27:42.662
<i>and, I don't know,</i> <i>a pony.</i>

27:44.414 --> 27:46.499
<i>Uh, you got 10 minutes
or I start killing people.</i>

27:46.666 --> 27:51.254
<i>Remember, this is being broadcast to
every home in Gotham, so,</i>

27:51.588 --> 27:54.966
<i>you know, don't let people die.
Bye</i>.

28:01.056 --> 28:03.433
- I think that went well.
- Enough.

28:06.311 --> 28:09.939
<i>You need to pack up your
pathetic little sideshow and leave.</i>

28:10.440 --> 28:11.691
Is that right?

28:12.359 --> 28:15.612
It may be presumptuous
to speak for all the citizens of Gotham,

28:16.279 --> 28:18.406
<i>but we are sick of you.</i>

28:19.574 --> 28:23.661
You're a small, vicious man
with a pathetic need for attention.

28:25.205 --> 28:26.498
Enough, man.

28:27.207 --> 28:29.209
For God sakes, enough.

28:30.627 --> 28:34.089
I'm curious what your leverage
is here, Mr...

28:35.882 --> 28:37.258
<i>Theo Galavan.</i>

28:37.425 --> 28:40.303
<i>Well, Mr. Theo Galavan,</i>

28:40.470 --> 28:45.225
if you don't sit down, uh,
I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.521
I know there is some
human decency left in you.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.565
If you need to take a hostage, take me.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.484
But let these people go home.

28:54.651 --> 28:57.570
To their families, to their children.

29:00.490 --> 29:02.492
<i>- Boring.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

29:04.661 --> 29:06.663
Get your men. We're going in.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.342
I used this to sneak into the party.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.553
We're lucky those dummies
didn't know about it.

29:21.719 --> 29:23.012
- Wait--
- We're almost outside.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.306
Wait! I have to go back.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.225
Are you crazy?
That guy was killing people.

29:27.392 --> 29:28.852
Yes. And Alfred's back there.

29:30.019 --> 29:31.354
I'm not going back.

29:31.521 --> 29:33.022
I don't expect you to.

29:35.859 --> 29:37.360
Selina...

29:39.195 --> 29:40.238
I miss you.

29:41.656 --> 29:42.866
I just wanted to say that.

29:57.797 --> 30:00.508
You're refusing a direct order?
I could have your stripes.

30:00.675 --> 30:03.928
That maniac killed the commissioner.
Not my men, we're not equipped for this.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.475
Fine. I'll go it alone.

30:11.603 --> 30:13.354
Oh.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.900
Hold very still.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.118
I can't look.

30:27.410 --> 30:28.953
Someone tell me how it turns out.

30:36.085 --> 30:39.047
Damn. Turn around.

30:42.759 --> 30:44.427
<i>Whoo!</i>

30:47.263 --> 30:48.640
Well, clap!

30:54.229 --> 30:56.439
So, Lee, how's Jim doing?

30:57.190 --> 31:00.693
I hope he's not blaming himself for this
whole "Essen being killed" thing.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.862
You are one crazy bitch.

31:03.196 --> 31:04.405
So rude.

31:05.615 --> 31:08.284
You know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make a prediction.

31:09.744 --> 31:12.872
Within a year,
Jim and I will be back together.

31:13.873 --> 31:15.291
Wanna know why?

31:15.833 --> 31:17.377
Because we're both the same.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.797
We both have a dark side.

31:21.798 --> 31:24.467
And one day,
we will tell our grandchildren

31:24.634 --> 31:29.389
about how this man-eating harpy
almost tore us apart.

31:29.973 --> 31:33.643
But in the end,
love conquered all.

31:34.477 --> 31:36.604
- You're...
- I'm sorry, what's that?

31:39.732 --> 31:41.317
Hasn't been 10 minutes.

31:41.568 --> 31:43.194
We need to buy you a watch.

31:47.824 --> 31:52.579
<i>Well, I think it's time
for tonight's first official victim.</i>

31:52.996 --> 31:55.164
<i>You all know and love.</i>

31:55.748 --> 31:57.041
<i>Poor rich boy,</i>

31:57.208 --> 32:02.255
<i>parents murdered in an alley,
and my favorite volunteer.</i>

32:02.672 --> 32:06.926
<i>Where is Bruce Wayne?</i>

32:13.516 --> 32:15.184
<i>You know I'm an orphan too, Bruce?</i>

32:16.352 --> 32:17.854
<i>I killed my parents, though.</i>

32:18.271 --> 32:19.856
<i>Where are you hiding?</i>

32:23.735 --> 32:24.986
<i>Bruce!</i>

32:25.987 --> 32:27.322
<i>Where are you, buddy?</i>

32:28.698 --> 32:29.991
Kill his butler.

32:32.493 --> 32:33.953
<i>Come on, move it, butler.</i>

32:39.542 --> 32:41.210
<i>All right, last chance, Bruce,</i>

32:41.377 --> 32:44.297
<i>but it's about to get
very butler-brainy out here.</i>

32:50.011 --> 32:51.471
Detective Gordon.

32:51.638 --> 32:54.766
He's gonna kill Alfred. I have to help.

32:55.099 --> 32:57.352
<i>Brucey!</i>

32:58.519 --> 33:00.688
No. It's you he wants.

33:01.272 --> 33:04.317
Bruce, he just wants you.

33:06.736 --> 33:09.614
I will not let him hurt Alfred.

33:16.412 --> 33:18.623
<i>I'm bored. Shoot the butler.</i>

33:18.956 --> 33:20.249
Stop!

33:27.965 --> 33:29.425
What the bloody hell are you doing, Bruce?

33:29.592 --> 33:32.178
There's a gun in my jacket.
Detective Gordon's behind the curtains.

33:36.808 --> 33:38.309
Let's get this started, huh?

33:38.643 --> 33:40.687
You, check behind the curtain.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.939
Make sure no one's playing
silly buggers.

33:54.909 --> 33:57.286
Drop the knife!

34:01.624 --> 34:03.042
I don't have a clean shot.

34:04.627 --> 34:06.963
Stay calm, Bruce.

34:07.171 --> 34:09.298
It seems like
we've got ourselves a pickle.

34:09.632 --> 34:13.136
What do you say, Brucey boy?
Wanna boost our ratings, huh?

34:15.221 --> 34:16.431
<i>Smile.</i>

34:19.726 --> 34:20.977
<i>I said enough.</i>

34:30.319 --> 34:31.863
I know, I know.

34:36.284 --> 34:38.077
This is not what we rehearsed.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.413
I'm so sorry, Jerome.

34:40.580 --> 34:45.835
You have real talent.
But now you see, the plot thickens.

34:46.502 --> 34:49.172
Enter the hero.

34:50.423 --> 34:52.967
You said

34:53.217 --> 34:56.471
I was gonna be...

35:15.239 --> 35:16.532
Jim! Stop her!

35:36.928 --> 35:39.430
<i>A pony.</i>
<i>Uh...</i>

35:39.972 --> 35:42.809
See, someone like that
has no interest in building things.

35:44.101 --> 35:46.270
He's not part of a tradition. Hmm.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.273
It's chaos for chaos' sake.

35:53.236 --> 35:55.029
Perhaps I could use a new laugh.

36:00.284 --> 36:01.285
Huh?

36:02.078 --> 36:03.079
Wow!

36:03.746 --> 36:04.872
Dude!

36:05.289 --> 36:06.833
<i>Color me impressed.</i>

36:07.124 --> 36:08.125
You know, if I close my eyes,

36:08.292 --> 36:10.586
I can still see you
holding Fish's umbrella.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.965
"Yes, Miss Mooney. No, Miss Mooney.

36:14.423 --> 36:15.925
"Whatever you say, Miss Mooney.

36:16.551 --> 36:18.761
"That wig looks great on you,
Miss Mooney."

36:19.095 --> 36:23.224
Seriously, the worm has turned.

36:25.601 --> 36:29.355
Detective Bullock,
I heard you rejoined the force.

36:30.523 --> 36:32.483
I'm so happy.

36:34.110 --> 36:36.654
But aren't you missing
all of the excitement?

36:36.821 --> 36:40.199
Yeah, I got the word too late.
Besides, I want to talk to you.

36:40.867 --> 36:41.993
Of course.

36:42.577 --> 36:43.786
Always happy to help.

36:43.953 --> 36:47.456
See, there's talk on the street
that Jim Gordon did a favor for you.

36:47.665 --> 36:50.293
Collected a debt
and the guy ended up dead.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.881
Rumors.

36:55.256 --> 36:56.507
Rumors.

36:58.759 --> 37:01.804
Well, then again, where there's smoke...

37:06.809 --> 37:08.311
Jim shouldn't worry about that.

37:08.936 --> 37:10.271
He and I are good friends.

37:10.438 --> 37:12.440
Well, see, that's the problem, Oswald,
I think he is worried.

37:12.607 --> 37:13.774
Because something happened today

37:13.941 --> 37:15.359
and you were
the obvious person to come to,

37:15.526 --> 37:18.863
and I sensed Jim was a little reluctant
to come down here.

37:19.322 --> 37:22.450
Like I said, he shouldn't worry.

37:23.618 --> 37:25.494
As long as you two remain friends.

37:25.953 --> 37:28.414
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

37:32.084 --> 37:36.255
I've got a half a mind to take you outside
and beat you senseless with a garbage can.

37:41.677 --> 37:43.054
Maybe some other time.

37:47.475 --> 37:49.268
Call yourself whatever you want, man.

37:50.102 --> 37:51.604
"The King of Gotham."

37:52.063 --> 37:55.358
<i>But to me,
you'll always be that little umbrella boy.</i>

37:55.691 --> 37:58.778
And if you come after Jim Gordon,
you gotta come after me.

37:59.487 --> 38:01.238
And I still owe you for Fish.

38:03.574 --> 38:06.869
But seriously, this place is amazing.

38:17.546 --> 38:19.131
Give me another drink.

38:32.770 --> 38:34.188
You were very brave.

38:34.522 --> 38:36.232
You helped save the lives
of everyone in here.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.651
Your parents...

38:39.110 --> 38:40.194
They would've been proud.

38:40.361 --> 38:41.696
That they would have been.

38:42.530 --> 38:45.908
They also would have given me the sack
for letting you do something so idiotic.

38:47.034 --> 38:49.161
It was all of us. We were a team.

38:50.621 --> 38:52.039
Yeah, I guess we were.

38:53.916 --> 38:55.251
Is he okay?

38:55.584 --> 38:58.254
Fine. Though I'd still like him
to get checked out at the hospital.

38:58.421 --> 38:59.672
Barbara gave him quite a knock.

39:00.881 --> 39:02.049
Any word on her?

39:02.216 --> 39:04.427
I don't know.
She went through a trap door in the stage.

39:04.593 --> 39:07.013
They must have always been planning
to use that as their exit.

39:08.222 --> 39:09.682
Don't worry, we'll find her.

39:12.351 --> 39:14.395
Uh, Mr. Galavan, sir.

39:14.895 --> 39:16.188
Alfred Pennyworth.

39:16.355 --> 39:19.358
I'd just like to thank you for saving
young Master Wayne's life.

39:19.608 --> 39:20.609
Oh.

39:20.818 --> 39:23.404
If there's anything
I can ever do for you, sir.

39:23.779 --> 39:24.780
Or I.

39:25.197 --> 39:29.160
I really just did what any citizen
of Gotham would have done.

39:29.410 --> 39:30.745
I wish that were true.

39:31.287 --> 39:32.371
Jim Gordon.

39:32.913 --> 39:34.123
Theo.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.334
Well, if you ever need anything,
please call.

39:38.044 --> 39:39.462
We're all in this together, right?

39:41.255 --> 39:42.465
Thank you, sir.

39:44.008 --> 39:47.011
Right, well, I suppose I better be
getting this young man home.

39:47.178 --> 39:49.972
It's been much more of an
exciting evening than originally planned.

39:50.139 --> 39:52.308
I never did like magicians.

39:52.808 --> 39:53.976
Good night.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.145
It was very nice meeting you,
Dr. Thompkins.

39:56.312 --> 39:57.396
And you, Bruce.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.690
Good night's sleep,
you'll be right as roses.

40:02.318 --> 40:04.236
I do hope we get to see you again soon.

40:05.738 --> 40:06.864
Thank you.

40:09.909 --> 40:11.118
Alfred.

40:15.748 --> 40:19.001
- You're sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

40:21.629 --> 40:22.755
Kiss me?

40:24.799 --> 40:26.258
- Jim...
- Kiss me.

40:34.350 --> 40:35.893
- Oh, bugger.
- Alfred.

40:36.060 --> 40:37.770
- You knew, didn't you?
- I didn't know, Alfred.

40:37.937 --> 40:40.272
You did.
You let me make a right mug of meself.

40:40.439 --> 40:41.857
<i>Alfred. No, I didn't.</i>

40:42.191 --> 40:43.776
<i>- You did.</i>
<i>- I didn't know.</i>

40:43.943 --> 40:45.194
<i>Well, I didn't know.</i>

41:09.552 --> 41:11.512
<i>Despite the presence of the G.C.P.D.,</i>

41:11.679 --> 41:13.264
<i>it was billionaire Theo Galavan,</i>

41:13.430 --> 41:16.225
newly arrived in Gotham,
but already making his name,

41:16.392 --> 41:18.352
<i>who stood up to the escaped lunatic.</i>

41:20.062 --> 41:21.522
- Am I a hero?
- Hmm.

41:21.939 --> 41:22.982
Apparently.

41:23.149 --> 41:25.067
<i>...greeted him with rapturous applause.</i>

41:25.234 --> 41:27.194
<i>I think tonight,
the people of Gotham have said,</i>

41:27.361 --> 41:30.656
<i>"Enough. The reign of tyranny is over."</i>

41:30.906 --> 41:33.075
Now the real fun begins.

41:34.410 --> 41:35.494
Poor Jerome.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.580
<i>Yes, very sad.</i>

41:37.872 --> 41:39.498
Such a compelling character, but limited.

41:39.665 --> 41:41.417
No, he was never gonna last long.

41:42.084 --> 41:43.586
I don't know about that.

41:44.378 --> 41:45.921
The kid had a way about him.

41:48.507 --> 41:49.842
<i>Oh, poor baby,</i>

41:51.135 --> 41:52.469
did you get a bump?

41:52.636 --> 41:54.930
<i>... G.C.P.D. Commissioner Sarah Essen.</i>

42:04.190 --> 42:06.567
<i>...the killer, Jerome Valeska, is dead,</i>

42:06.734 --> 42:10.446
<i>his murderous escapades
left a deep impression on Gotham.</i>

42:10.613 --> 42:13.324
<i>Nobody here is getting out alive.</i>

42:37.973 --> 42:39.141
Coming through.

42:41.185 --> 42:42.519
<i>Bang</i>.

43:01.914 --> 43:05.501
<i>You will be a curse upon Gotham.</i>

43:07.211 --> 43:12.007
<i>Children will wake from sleep,
screaming at the thought of you.</i>

43:12.174 --> 43:17.054
<i>Your legacy will be death and madness.</i>
