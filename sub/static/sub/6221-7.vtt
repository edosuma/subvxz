00:01.669 --> 00:05.173
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.256 --> 00:10.261
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.264
His name, Merlin.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.309
(GASPING) Arthur.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.313
Arthur!

01:49.819 --> 01:51.028
What is it?

01:51.320 --> 01:54.282
You really are a total
buffoon, aren't you, Merlin?

01:54.365 --> 01:56.367
-I was just asking...
-Who? Me or the deer?

01:56.867 --> 01:59.036
We're supposed to be hunting.
It requires speed,

01:59.161 --> 02:01.622
stealth and an agile mind.

02:01.706 --> 02:03.541
So you're able to get by
on two out of three, then?

02:03.666 --> 02:04.792
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

02:05.876 --> 02:07.295
-What was that?
-Quiet!

02:07.378 --> 02:08.545
MAN: No! No!
WOMAN: Help!

02:10.881 --> 02:12.967
-No, no, I beg you. Mercy!
-Give us some money.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.720
-Help, help me! Let go!
-(CRYING OUT)

02:16.178 --> 02:18.139
Get off me! Get off me!

02:46.751 --> 02:47.918
(CHANTING)

03:07.855 --> 03:09.690
Stroke of luck.

03:09.774 --> 03:12.443
And let that be a lesson to you!

03:15.196 --> 03:18.199
What? I was covering your back.

03:19.075 --> 03:21.118
You all right? They didn't hurt you?

03:23.120 --> 03:25.748
No, thanks to you.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.959
I'm Sophia. This is my father.

03:29.085 --> 03:32.588
Arthur Pendragon at your service.

03:40.096 --> 03:44.433
My name is Aulfric, heir to Tirmawr,

03:44.975 --> 03:47.311
this is my daughter, Sophia.

03:48.062 --> 03:51.941
You're a long way from home.
What brings you to Camelot?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.984
Our home was sacked by raiders,

03:54.068 --> 03:57.822
we barely escaped with what
few possessions we could carry.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.824
UTHER:
These are dangerous times.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.576
What will you do?

04:02.827 --> 04:04.912
We travel West to Caerleon

04:04.995 --> 04:08.124
where we have family
and, I hope, a new life.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.295
You must stay here a while,
break your journey.

04:13.838 --> 04:17.632
A noble family like yours
is always welcome at Camelot.

04:36.986 --> 04:39.447
Make sure you put her
in a decent room.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.574
The one next door is empty.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.742
The one next door's fine,

04:44.285 --> 04:45.494
excellent, in fact.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.624
-Shut up, Merlin.
- I didn't say anything...

04:50.708 --> 04:53.210
You didn't have to.
| want to make it clear

04:53.294 --> 04:57.131
that my intentions towards Sophia
are completely honorable.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.095
Put her in a room on the other
side of the castle.

05:03.304 --> 05:06.223
-It's warmer, more comfortable.
-Of course.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.018
She is very beautiful.

05:09.894 --> 05:11.061
Yes, she is.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.897
And if your intentions are honorable...

05:12.980 --> 05:15.566
Oh, they are. Most definitely.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.277
Then what's the problem with her
staying next door?

05:19.862 --> 05:21.614
There isn't one.

05:23.407 --> 05:27.161
You've convinced me.
Put her in the room next to mine.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.251
-If you need anything, just let me know.
-Thank you.

05:41.592 --> 05:42.885
Who is that?

05:42.968 --> 05:44.553
Sophia Tirmawr.

05:44.762 --> 05:48.390
We rescued her in the woods.
Well, Arthur did most of the rescuing.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.850
She can't stay here.

05:51.227 --> 05:53.729
The King said that she and her
father are welcome in Camelot.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.775
Is everything okay?

06:01.403 --> 06:03.239
Yes. Thank you.

06:10.079 --> 06:12.706
I'm sorry,
| didn't mean to disturb you.

06:12.790 --> 06:17.461
Nonsense, my child.
My favorite patient is always welcome.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.966
I'm sorry about the mess.
Most of it's Merlin's.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.385
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have tidied up in here.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.679
It's not that. It's just...
Your bench is on fire.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.390
My bench is on fire?
What you...

06:30.516 --> 06:33.310
My bench is on fire!

06:36.522 --> 06:37.773
Here.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.404
You're always getting me
into trouble.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.075
What brings you to this dark corner?

06:49.493 --> 06:52.788
-I had another dream.
- I see.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.836
| saw Arthur lying under water, drowning

06:59.587 --> 07:03.716
and there was a woman standing over him,
watching him die.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.678
And she's here. In Camelot.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.139
The mind plays tricks,

07:10.222 --> 07:13.392
it borrows from everyday life
and plays out its own fantasy.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.603
But I had this dream
before she came to Camelot.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.187
You must be mistaken.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.981
No, I know what I saw.

07:20.733 --> 07:24.194
It was so real, so vivid.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.824
| saw him die, Gaius.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.368
She's going to kill him.

07:31.619 --> 07:35.122
These are just dreams,
Morgana, nothing more.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.000
Are you taking the sleeping draught
| made up for you?

07:38.083 --> 07:39.835
It doesn't help.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.128
Here.

07:42.546 --> 07:46.050
Try this, it will induce a deeper sleep.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.678
You've nothing to fear.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.056
Thank you, Gaius.

07:58.771 --> 08:02.858
Morgana, don't bother Uther about this,

08:03.651 --> 08:05.027
no need to worry him.

08:27.883 --> 08:30.260
You can dispense
with the unpleasantries.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.763
-Your payment.
-I want more.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.557
My friends are dead because of you.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.184
Yes, I'm sorry.
Such a dreadful waste of a life.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.730
If it's any consolation,
you'll see them again soon.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.400
(CHANTING)

08:44.775 --> 08:45.943
(SCREAMING)

09:08.716 --> 09:10.718
I'm taking Sophia
out for a ride today.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.678
You know, show her around.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.555
Where do I come in to this?

09:14.638 --> 09:18.726
Well, I'm supposed to be on patrol with
the guard and my father this morning

09:18.809 --> 09:20.894
so, I need you to cover for me.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.439
What, and lie to the King?

09:23.522 --> 09:27.025
No. No way, he'll see right through me,
he'll have me in the stocks

09:27.109 --> 09:28.527
quicker than you can say
rotten tomatoes.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.404
-Merlin.
-(SIGHING)

09:30.487 --> 09:31.780
| need you to do this for me.

09:31.864 --> 09:33.741
I'm a terrible liar. I start sweating,

09:33.824 --> 09:36.243
my vision blurs, my brain stops working.

09:36.326 --> 09:40.622
Oh, no change there then.
Look, I promised Sophia I'd take her out

09:40.706 --> 09:42.666
and if I don't turn up,
it'll blow my chances.

09:43.459 --> 09:46.545
-You like her, then?
-Yeah, what's not to like?

09:47.546 --> 09:48.922
| want to spend some more time with her,

09:49.006 --> 09:51.091
but I need to get my father off my back.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.303
| can't order you to lie to the King,

09:54.386 --> 09:57.097
but you'll be a friend for life
if you do.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.227
Go on then, you don't want
to keep her waiting.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.272
Thanks, Merlin. I won't forget it.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.155
GWEN: You're sure it's her?

10:13.655 --> 10:15.741
| could never forget that face.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.534
You should speak to the King.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.329
And tell him what?
That I can see the future?

10:20.412 --> 10:22.456
If you think Arthur's life
is in danger...

10:22.539 --> 10:24.208
You know how he'd react.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.210
You're his ward. He wouldn't harm you.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.504
He hates magic
more than he cares for me.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.799
-That's not true.
-Would you care to put it to the test?

10:34.343 --> 10:36.053
But what else can you do?

10:36.512 --> 10:38.847
I'm going to have to try
and stop her myself.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.103
Where's my son?

10:45.187 --> 10:46.313
I'm not sure where he is.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.149
| think there's been a mistake,
but it's not his fault.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.317
Arthur's, I mean.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.653
Stop gibbering
and tell me where he is!

10:52.736 --> 10:54.947
It's probably, no,
it's definitely my fault.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.783
-Where is Arthur?
-He's not here.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.201
| can see that.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.786
Arthur wasn't sure of his orders

11:00.869 --> 11:02.079
so he asked me to check with the guards

11:02.162 --> 11:04.039
to see if he was riding out
this morning,

11:04.122 --> 11:06.500
and, well, I may have forgotten.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.168
You forgot?

11:08.252 --> 11:12.339
I'm sorry, my Lord, I'm sure
he would've been here had I told him.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.133
If this was a time of war,
| would have you flogged.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.345
And since it's not,
we'll let it go just this once?

11:22.474 --> 11:23.684
| forgot how much fun this was.

11:30.232 --> 11:33.151
The river's not far.
It's just down here.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.613
Arthur, wait.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.117
What is it?

11:49.376 --> 11:52.129
(CHANTING)

11:53.755 --> 11:55.173
-GUARD: You there!
-(GASPING)

11:56.466 --> 11:57.634
Halt!

12:08.270 --> 12:09.730
-Sorry.
-ARTHUR: Sorry?

12:09.813 --> 12:13.650
You nearly shot a crossbow in my face.
What do you mean, you're sorry?

12:13.734 --> 12:15.694
Who's in charge here?

12:26.747 --> 12:29.958
-Are you okay?
-Yes, thanks to you.

12:30.292 --> 12:33.420
They were searching for the bandits
that attacked you yesterday.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.673
-Here...
-Don't touch that.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.009
I'm sorry.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.470
Maybe we should go back?

12:41.553 --> 12:45.057
It's fine. I'm sorry I was upset.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.268
Now don't let this spoil
our day together.

12:48.352 --> 12:52.230
We were having such a nice time.
Let's go down to the river.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.732
I'm taking you back to Camelot.

12:53.815 --> 12:57.361
Your father would never forgive me
if I let anything happen to you.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.913
Have you been playing
with your food again?

13:08.705 --> 13:10.332
The King put me in the stocks.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.668
-What did you do this time?
-Nothing.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.879
Honestly, it wasn't my fault.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.800
Arthur wanted to get out of going
on patrol with Uther and the guard.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.886
So I covered for him
and took the blame.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.639
And Arthur was prepared
to let you do this?

13:25.722 --> 13:27.307
It was his idea.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.309
What made him neglect his duties?

13:29.393 --> 13:32.062
It must've been something
terribly important.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.064
Sophia.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.191
The girl from the forest?

13:36.274 --> 13:38.860
Mmm-hmm.
He wanted to take her out for the day.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.154
He is besotted.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.199
-But they've only just met.
- I know.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.619
| guess it must've been
love at first sight.

13:49.287 --> 13:50.831
Yes.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.418
| suppose it must be.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.460
Can I help?

14:36.960 --> 14:38.462
Forgive me.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.006
The door was open.
| thought someone may've broken in.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.133
Looks like they have.

14:46.011 --> 14:50.140
| apologize for imposing on you.
It won't happen again.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.644
Make sure it doesn't.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.664
You're sure you'll be all right?

15:16.166 --> 15:17.334
Yes.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.878
Thank you for today.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.509
Good night, Arthur.

15:40.232 --> 15:43.902
Sorry. Lady Morgana, isn't it?
I'm Sophia.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.364
-What're you doing here?
-My father and I are guests of the King.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.283
You're lying.
| know what you're going to do to him

15:50.408 --> 15:51.535
and I won't let it happen.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.871
Does Arthur know you feel
this way about him?

15:56.581 --> 16:00.127
Of course he does, I suspect
he's already turned you down.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.838
Don't think you can make
a fool out of me.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.924
| don't have to, you're managing
to do that well enough already.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.802
-Stay away from him!
-Or what?

16:10.220 --> 16:13.056
Jealousy's such an unattractive
trait in a woman.

16:13.473 --> 16:17.394
If anything happens to Arthur,
I'll find you.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.981
However long it takes.

16:29.406 --> 16:32.617
You've not been gone
as long as I expected.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.287
-We were interrupted.
-What happened?

16:36.121 --> 16:38.165
| was nearly killed.

16:38.582 --> 16:42.169
For a moment I felt what it would be
like to die a mortal death.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.088
He saved me.

16:46.173 --> 16:49.926
Someone so weak, so feeble, saved me.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.930
| can't bear to be like this
a moment longer.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.932
You won't have to.

16:56.016 --> 17:00.437
Once his heart is yours the gates
of Avalon will open once again for us

17:00.604 --> 17:02.647
and we can regain our true form.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.025
| need a little more time.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.108
You must hurry.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.944
The physician can see us
for what we truly are.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.114
And he is not alone.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.118
The Lady Morgana.
She fears her powers,

17:16.203 --> 17:17.954
but that will not keep her quiet
for long.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.582
Tomorrow you have to finish
the enchantment,

17:20.665 --> 17:25.377
otherwise, our chance to rid us of these
mortal shells will be lost forever.

17:28.632 --> 17:30.217
You seem very fond of her.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.885
You make that sound like a bad thing.

17:31.968 --> 17:32.969
Not necessarily.

17:33.053 --> 17:36.348
I've just never seen you fall
under a woman's spell so quickly.

17:36.473 --> 17:39.184
If you're jealous, Morgana,
it's okay to admit it.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.311
Don't flatter yourself.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.729
Come on.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.981
Wouldn't be the first time, now,
would it?

17:45.065 --> 17:48.568
Arthur, I'm trying to protect you.
She isn't what she seems.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.071
Why? What makes you say that?

17:52.989 --> 17:54.950
| just have a feeling.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.663
It's difficult to describe.

18:02.165 --> 18:05.669
| had a dream, a nightmare.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.837
(ARTHUR LAUGHING)

18:10.465 --> 18:12.550
You really are very sweet, Morgana.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.010
Why are you laughing?

18:14.344 --> 18:18.056
You. Your feelings, bad dreams.

18:18.181 --> 18:22.185
You don't have to make this stuff up.
You can tell me the truth.

18:22.978 --> 18:24.271
It's obvious you like me.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.314
Less and less by the second.

18:26.398 --> 18:29.025
All right. Whatever you say.

18:29.401 --> 18:33.697
You're intolerable.
| just hope I'm wrong about her.

18:45.417 --> 18:46.710
You're dressed!

18:46.835 --> 18:48.545
Nothing gets past you, does it, Merlin?

18:48.670 --> 18:50.046
You're supposed to be wearing these.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.674
Your father is bestowing a knighthood
on one of your men this morning.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.093
-I'm giving it a miss.
-(SIGHING)

18:55.719 --> 18:57.012
Won't the King mind?

18:57.095 --> 18:59.055
Not if you cover for me again.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.640
By the way, thanks for yesterday,

19:00.724 --> 19:02.559
| heard you ended up in the stocks.
Bad luck.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.562
They were throwing potatoes at me.
It's only supposed to be rotten fruit.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.397
I'm not sure there's any
hard and fast rules

19:07.522 --> 19:09.399
but if it's any consolation,
| think it was worth it.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.903
-It went well?
-Great. Fantastic.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.074
She's incredible.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.287
Don't worry.
I'll find a way to get you out of it.

19:22.579 --> 19:25.457
Just make sure you don't end up
in the stocks this time.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.916
| won't.

of this whole deception lark.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.780
(CONTINUES CHANTING)

20:15.423 --> 20:17.467
Not again, Merlin, surely...

20:18.510 --> 20:21.388
You'd think that the appeal of
pelting the same person with fruit

20:21.471 --> 20:23.681
would wear off after a while,
but, oh, no.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.768
| heard that Arthur
wasn't at the Knighting ceremony.

20:27.477 --> 20:31.147
Yeah, he wanted to make the most
of his time left with Sophia.

20:31.272 --> 20:34.150
-So you helped him.
-I'm his servant, I had to.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.194
You shouldn't' have done that, Merlin.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.656

all that she seems.

20:40.698 --> 20:41.783
Why?

20:41.866 --> 20:44.619
What do you know about seers?

20:45.286 --> 20:49.582
Not much. They're supposed to be
able to see the future.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.252
-Like prophets.
-It's said to be an innate ability.

20:52.335 --> 20:55.338
Those who have it are born that way.
Some aren't even aware

20:55.463 --> 20:59.342
that what they see is the future,
it comes to them in their dreams.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.511
What's this got
to do with Sophia?

21:01.636 --> 21:04.013
The night before she and Aulfric
came to Camelot,

21:04.180 --> 21:06.015
Morgana had a dream.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.393
Sophia was in it.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.312
Before she arrived in Camelot?

21:12.897 --> 21:15.984
I've been watching Morgana
since she was very young.

21:16.234 --> 21:18.319
And though I've tried
to persuade myself otherwise,

21:18.403 --> 21:22.907
| realized that some of the things
she said she'd dreamt came to pass.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.702
| kept it secret from Uther, of course.

21:25.827 --> 21:28.913
The gift of prophecy is too close
to the work of magic.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.499
You think that Morgana is a seer?

21:31.583 --> 21:34.335
No, I don't think it. I fear it.

21:35.211 --> 21:39.716
Morgana said she dreamt
that Sophia killed Arthur.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.845
Couldn't that have just been a dream?

21:43.928 --> 21:46.890
Maybe the woman Morgana saw
just looked like Sophia.

21:47.015 --> 21:50.435
That's what I hoped,
but Aulfric caught me in Sophia's room

21:50.560 --> 21:55.565
and in a flash of anger,
his eyes changed color.

21:57.734 --> 21:58.902
Who are they?

22:00.945 --> 22:03.740
It's not who they are that worries me,

22:03.865 --> 22:06.409
it's what they want with Arthur.

22:10.914 --> 22:14.584
Our love is strong,
you feel the same way, too.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.587
If we were ever to be parted...

22:17.712 --> 22:19.380
I'd never let that happen.

22:20.590 --> 22:23.009
You may not have the choice.

22:23.259 --> 22:26.763
There are some here who don't want
us to be together.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.723
I'll never let anyone come between us.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.893
-Because we are in love.
-Because we are in love.

22:33.269 --> 22:36.105
You must seek permission
for us to marry.

22:36.439 --> 22:37.774
So that we can be together.

-The land of eternal youth.

| don't have a choice. I couldn't live
with myself knowing I'd let him die.

33:58.495 --> 34:02.791
Wait. We've known each other
a long time, you trust me, don't you?

34:02.875 --> 34:05.878
-Yes, you know I do.
-Then trust me now.

34:06.128 --> 34:09.047
Stay here and don't say a word to
anyone about this.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.842
-But, Arthur...
-I'll take care of it.

34:13.302 --> 34:16.513
-Where're you going?
-To find someone who can help.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.451
Merlin! What happened to you?

34:37.534 --> 34:38.827
(GROANING SOFTLY)

34:39.578 --> 34:41.871
Aulfric. Where's Arthur?

34:42.665 --> 34:45.793
| have got to go after him.
What's that buzzing noise...

34:46.126 --> 34:48.295
Careful, Merlin,
you can barely stand up.

34:48.379 --> 34:50.922
- I have to go.
-You can't, not in this state.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.257
You owe it to your powers

34:52.341 --> 34:55.052
-that you survived this at all.
-I'll be fine, he needs me.

34:55.469 --> 34:56.553
Has that buzzing stopped?

34:56.679 --> 34:57.680
-Yeah.
-Liar.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.974
| have to go, Gaius.
He'll die if I don't.

35:00.391 --> 35:02.476
The Sidhe are a vicious people.

35:02.559 --> 35:03.894
You must be careful.

35:03.978 --> 35:06.021
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.481
-Merlin?
-Hmm?

35:07.690 --> 35:09.733
-This way.
-Just testing.

35:24.581 --> 35:26.166
Go, they're waiting for you.

35:27.084 --> 35:28.836
| don't understand. You're coming too.

35:28.919 --> 35:31.755
Only one of us can pass through.
This was never meant for me.

35:34.091 --> 35:37.344
But I only wanted this so we could both
return to Avalon.

35:37.428 --> 35:40.097
Your destiny
is on a different path to mine.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.266
It is my fate to live a mortal life.

35:44.601 --> 35:45.769
| don't want to leave you.

35:45.853 --> 35:50.691
You must. Once the ceremony begins,
you have to go through with it.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.526
The elders expect a soul.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.528
If they don't get his,
they will take yours.

35:59.992 --> 36:03.912
(SOBBING)
Goodbye. I will never forget you.

36:41.658 --> 36:44.036
(CHANTING)

37:05.641 --> 37:07.434
(AULFRIC CONTINUES CHANTING)

37:52.104 --> 37:54.231
(PANTING)

37:54.314 --> 37:58.235
(AULFRIC CHANTING)

38:16.295 --> 38:17.421
(CHANTING)

38:23.844 --> 38:25.137
(CHANTING)

38:26.722 --> 38:27.931
(SCREAMS)

38:29.808 --> 38:32.978
Father! No! No!

38:33.937 --> 38:35.355
-(CHANTING)
-No! No!

38:45.699 --> 38:48.327
Arthur! Arthur?

38:51.497 --> 38:52.623
Arthur!

39:55.102 --> 39:56.395
(ARTHUR MOANING)

39:58.814 --> 40:00.148
Arthur?

40:01.149 --> 40:02.734
What happened?

40:05.070 --> 40:06.530
Where am I?

40:07.698 --> 40:09.866
Can you remember anything?

40:10.993 --> 40:12.494
(GROANING)

40:13.412 --> 40:15.080
Oh, my head...

40:19.376 --> 40:23.005
There was a girl. Sophia.

40:25.340 --> 40:28.760
| asked my father something
about her, I asked him...

40:34.433 --> 40:35.726
What was I thinking?

40:37.769 --> 40:39.688
Well, we did wonder.

40:40.188 --> 40:43.317
Especially when you eloped
with her last night.

40:43.400 --> 40:44.526
| did what?

40:44.610 --> 40:47.195
Merlin had to bring you back to Camelot.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.033
| don't recall any of this.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.910
It must've been some blow.

40:54.036 --> 40:55.787
What blow?

40:56.079 --> 40:57.831
Well, when I caught up with you

40:57.914 --> 41:00.959
| couldn't persuade you to return,
you were beyond reason.

41:01.043 --> 41:02.544
So I had to make you.

41:03.420 --> 41:05.380
You managed to knock me out?

41:05.464 --> 41:07.633
Yeah, with a lump of wood.

41:07.716 --> 41:10.427
He only did it to bring you back safely.

41:11.637 --> 41:15.432
No one can know about this. Any of it.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.895
Is that understood?

41:28.987 --> 41:31.114
UTHER: When you failed to show up
for patrol this morning,

41:31.239 --> 41:34.493
| feared you'd eloped with Sophia
in a fit of passion.

41:38.622 --> 41:40.415
| wish he had.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.585
Because then I wouldn't be stood
in front of you feeling like an idiot.

41:43.919 --> 41:45.128
Again.

41:45.629 --> 41:48.674
This is becoming a near
daily occurrence for you.

41:49.591 --> 41:50.884
But there was a mistake.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.512
And I would not say
it was anyone's fault.

41:53.595 --> 41:57.099
Not really... Um...
You could say it was mine.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.434
Could somebody tell me what happened?

41:59.643 --> 42:01.853
-MERLIN: Well...
-Someone with a brain.

42:03.605 --> 42:06.858
After Sophia left,
| wanted to take my mind off her

42:06.942 --> 42:09.528
so I went for a hunt.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.364
And killing things
mends a broken heart?

42:13.198 --> 42:16.868
No, but it's good fun.
Merlin was meant to inform you

42:16.952 --> 42:19.121
that I wouldn't be back
until later today.

42:21.623 --> 42:25.127
Have you some kind of mental affliction?

42:25.544 --> 42:27.963
-Probably.
-I'm looking into it, Sire.

42:28.797 --> 42:31.508
Well, I hope for our sake
you find a cure,

42:32.342 --> 42:34.970
or we'll find ourselves with
a food shortage on our hands.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.472
Food shortage?

42:44.980 --> 42:46.356
(KNOCKING)

42:48.150 --> 42:49.901
GAIUS: Morgana.

42:50.694 --> 42:52.654
I've had some troubled nights.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.867
I've prepared another draught for you.

42:58.994 --> 43:01.037
Have the dreams stopped?

43:02.497 --> 43:04.374
Arthur told me what actually happened.

43:07.210 --> 43:10.005
You must have hit him
round the head really hard.

43:10.422 --> 43:13.008
Yeah. I feel really bad about that.

43:15.927 --> 43:19.848
Here you are. Remember, every night
just before you go to sleep.

43:20.849 --> 43:22.559
Thank you, Gaius.

43:29.691 --> 43:30.942
(DOOR CLOSING)

43:31.193 --> 43:32.778
She must never find out the truth.

43:34.362 --> 43:37.783
Why not? She had a premonition
that helped save Arthur's life.

43:37.908 --> 43:40.619
And it could've cost her her own.
If Uther ever found out,

43:40.702 --> 43:44.539
things would never be the same again.
It must remain a secret.

43:45.624 --> 43:47.250
Is she like me?

43:48.210 --> 43:49.544
Can she use magic?

43:50.962 --> 43:53.048
No one's like you, Merlin.

43:55.759 --> 43:57.677
But she has the gift?

43:59.930 --> 44:02.224
For her sake, I hope not.

44:20.033 --> 44:21.576
(GASPING)

44:27.916 --> 44:29.751
You should not protect this boy.

44:32.128 --> 44:35.549
He's a Druid. His kind would see me
dead and you would help them.

44:35.632 --> 44:40.303
If the boy lives,
you cannot fulfill your destiny.

44:40.428 --> 44:42.639
-Enough!
-We need your help.

44:42.764 --> 44:45.100
So now you want me to risk my neck, too.

44:45.433 --> 44:49.062
You're telling me that little boy
is going to kill Arthur?
