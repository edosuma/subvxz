WEBVTT

00:09.270 --> 00:10.488
All right, Malcolm,
be careful up there.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.838
Well, don't worry,
Dad. I got him.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.362
I'm not worried about Malcolm.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.016
I'm worried about my lights.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.582
Those are

00:17.626 --> 00:20.542
practically new.
I bought them on my honeymoon.

00:20.585 --> 00:21.934
Yeah, which is why every year,

00:21.978 --> 00:23.632
I get shocked
by these janky wires.

00:23.675 --> 00:26.678
It's called
Christmas tradition.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.508
Okay, Marty, it's time
for a moment of truth.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.467
Plug 'em in.

00:35.557 --> 00:36.862
Uh...

00:36.906 --> 00:38.647
first can I grab
some rubber gloves?

00:38.690 --> 00:40.475
You know, I don't want a repeat
of last year.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.042
Would you
stop crying?

00:42.085 --> 00:43.869
Your mustache grew back.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.697
Okay, here we go.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.221
Ha, ha!

00:47.264 --> 00:48.439
One.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.093
Two.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.573
Hey, Merry
Christmas, guys.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.401
Ah, thank God.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.533
Hey, Dave, what's with the hat
and the scarf, man?

00:55.577 --> 00:57.448
It's 80 degrees.CALVIN:
Yeah.

00:57.492 --> 01:00.495
You keep all that on, you're
gonna roast your chestnuts.

01:00.538 --> 01:03.672
I'm just trying to get
into the Christmas spirit.

01:03.715 --> 01:06.240
You know, in Michigan,
we'd be having snowball fights,

01:06.283 --> 01:08.546
going sledding,
building snowmen.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.548
Boy, do I miss it.

01:10.592 --> 01:11.636
That's right. Last year,

01:11.680 --> 01:12.594
you guys spent Christmas
in Kalamazoo.

01:12.637 --> 01:14.552
And boy, do I miss it.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.252
Yeah. W-We went back
because of my mom.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.471
But this year,
we decided to stay here.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.299
Again, because of my mom.

01:23.605 --> 01:26.086
I just wish it felt a little
more Christmasy out here.

01:26.129 --> 01:29.176
Hey, it's plenty
Christmasy out here.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.395
I mean, just yesterday,
Crackhead Victor tried

01:31.439 --> 01:33.484
to sell me a dime bag
of mistletoe.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.357
Uh, you know, Dave,

01:36.400 --> 01:37.967
if you want
to feel Christmasy,

01:38.010 --> 01:41.188
uh, why don't you do the honors
and plug in our lights?

01:41.231 --> 01:42.537
Oh, man, I'd love to!

01:42.580 --> 01:44.582
Okay, well, now hold on.

01:44.626 --> 01:48.195
Now, Dave, those shoes
do have a rubber sole, right?

01:48.238 --> 01:49.674
Yeah.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.241
Well, then light 'em up!

01:52.547 --> 01:55.419
Here we go.

01:57.726 --> 02:00.511
Damn, Dave, you broke my lights.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.993
And those were practically new.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.647
All I did was plug 'em in.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.170
Yeah, but you probably didn't...

02:11.957 --> 02:14.569
Hey, uh,
don't-don't
worry, Dad.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.005
Your mustache
will grow back.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.574
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:19.617 --> 02:20.749
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.493
Ah. Hey, Santa.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.321
You know,
you're the only black man

02:27.364 --> 02:28.670
that can sneak
in people's houses

02:28.713 --> 02:30.237
and everybody's cool with it.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.108
DAVE:
Hey, Calvin.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.154
Heads up. I'm coming in hot!

02:35.677 --> 02:37.157
Whoa.

02:38.506 --> 02:41.378
Black Santa, meet White Dave.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.815
What's cracking, Kringle?

02:43.859 --> 02:45.208
What's with the scooter?

02:45.252 --> 02:47.123
It's Grover's Christmas present.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.733
They're sold out
everywhere. I had to go

02:48.777 --> 02:50.387
to six different
stores to get one.Oh.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.259
That reminds me
of when the boys wanted

02:52.302 --> 02:53.912
a Tickle Me Elmo
for Christmas.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.436
How many stores you go to?

02:55.479 --> 02:58.830
None. They could tickle
each other for free.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.745
All right, well,
I better go hide this

03:00.789 --> 03:02.356
before Grover
and Gemma get back

03:02.399 --> 03:03.966
from having their picture
taken with Santa.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.447
Oh, you didn't
want to go?
No.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.318
I already got mine.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.451
I see someone didn't open
their e-mail.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.501
Can I lick the beaters?

03:17.545 --> 03:19.329
Sweetie,
the batter has raw eggs in it.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.026
You could make yourself sick.

03:21.070 --> 03:24.378
Are you just saying that so
you can keep them for yourself?

03:24.421 --> 03:27.511
Fine, but I get the one
with more on it.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.298
TINA:
Hey, Gemma, where
are you, girl?

03:31.341 --> 03:33.517
In the kitchen!
Quick, hide these.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.432
There's not enough
batter for all of us.

03:35.476 --> 03:36.738
Hey, what are
you guys...?

03:36.781 --> 03:38.522
There's none left!

03:40.829 --> 03:42.309
Hey, Tina. What's up?

03:42.352 --> 03:44.224
Well, I came by
to grab those old toys

03:44.267 --> 03:45.616
for the charity drive at church.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.749
I'll be damned
if I let Loretta Banks think

03:47.792 --> 03:49.359
she's a better Christian
than me.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.535
Oh. They're right here.Awesome.

03:51.579 --> 03:54.799
Hey, those are mine.Yeah, but if you don't get rid
of your old toys,

03:54.843 --> 03:57.324
there won't be enough room
for Santa to bring you new ones.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.674
Well, if it's for the kids.

04:01.023 --> 04:03.243
So, what are
you guys making?

04:03.286 --> 04:04.418
Gingerbread men.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.115
Oh.We make them every year.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.986
It's our mommy-son
tradition.

04:08.030 --> 04:10.641
Aw, I miss when my boys were
little. We used to dress up

04:10.685 --> 04:12.861
in our Christmas sweaters
and make ornaments

04:12.904 --> 04:15.646
out of Popsicle sticks
and dry pasta.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.518
Oh, that's so sweet.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.346
Yeah, it was, until the year

04:19.389 --> 04:21.478
that Malcolm crammed macaroni
up Marty's nose.

04:21.522 --> 04:24.351
Was he okay?

04:24.394 --> 04:26.527
Oh, yeah. He whistled
when he slept for a while, but,

04:26.570 --> 04:28.964
you know, as soon as he caught
a cold, he sneezed it right out.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.794
Well, thanks
again for these.You're welcome.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.491
Oh, and, uh, by the way,

04:34.535 --> 04:36.754
I know you two are holding
out on that batter.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.540
And Santa does, too.

04:42.194 --> 04:45.023
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

04:45.067 --> 04:48.549
Hey, Calvin! Something
terrible happened.

04:48.592 --> 04:51.247
I know. I saw
your picture with Santa.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.946
You were way too big
to be sitting in his lap.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.166
No, I was robbed.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.690
Somebody broke into my garage
and took Grover's scooter.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.910
Whoa. Are you sure?
May-Maybe Gemma moved it.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.695
No, there was a broken window,
and they ransacked the place.

05:04.739 --> 05:08.873
My spring sweater collection
is all over the floor!

05:08.917 --> 05:11.398
So we won't be looking
for anybody in a pink V-neck.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.576
I can't believe that somebody
would do something like this

05:15.619 --> 05:17.360
right before the
holidays. I mean,

05:17.404 --> 05:19.667
what kind of Christmas spirit
do people have around here?

05:19.710 --> 05:21.277
Okay, hold on now.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.148
Every neighborhood has
a few knuckleheads.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.673
I mean, doesn't mean
we don't have Christmas spirit.

05:25.716 --> 05:28.806
Yeah, well, all I know is,
I don't have a gift for Grover.

05:28.850 --> 05:31.461
And he doesn't even have
a brother he can tickle!

05:31.505 --> 05:34.072
Okay. All right,
all right, just relax.

05:34.116 --> 05:37.554
I think I know where we can go
to get your scooter back.Where?

05:37.598 --> 05:39.600
The barbershop.
It's where everybody

05:39.643 --> 05:41.689
in the neighborhood goes
to get information.

05:41.732 --> 05:44.344
It's like Black Google.

05:44.387 --> 05:47.172
It's how I found out
Queen Latifah was my cousin.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.829
Hey, hey, check it out.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.527
What's all this?

05:53.570 --> 05:55.093
Oh, I don't know.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.444
Popsicle sticks,
yarn, macaroni.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.184
It's back--

05:59.228 --> 06:00.795
Christmas quality time
with Mom!

06:02.492 --> 06:04.451
No, man. We are
way too old.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.278
She wouldn't really
expect us to be...

06:06.322 --> 06:08.455
There are
my sweet babies.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.720
Who's ready
to make ornaments with Mommy?

06:12.763 --> 06:14.417
BOTH:
We are.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.810
Yes!

06:19.857 --> 06:22.077
So what's the plan
when we get in there?

06:22.120 --> 06:24.427
Squeeze 'em 'till
we get the juice?

06:24.471 --> 06:26.647
What?

06:26.690 --> 06:29.650
You know, put the screws
on 'em 'till we get the 411.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.609
Why are you talking

06:32.653 --> 06:34.568
like a gangster
from the Disney Channel?

06:34.611 --> 06:37.962
Since everyone in there
already knows you,

06:38.006 --> 06:40.965
I figured you'd be good
cop, I'll be bad cop.

06:41.009 --> 06:42.967
Okay, all right, first of all,

06:43.011 --> 06:45.274
if we want anybody
to help us around here,

06:45.317 --> 06:46.841
don't say the word "cop."

06:46.884 --> 06:49.191
And second,

06:49.234 --> 06:51.454
we got to handle this
delicately, all right?

06:51.498 --> 06:54.196
Nobody wants
to be labelled a snitch.Okay.

06:54.239 --> 06:55.676
So, what do you
want me to do?

06:55.719 --> 06:59.244
Nothing. Just lay back
in the cut like a Band-Aid.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.551
Got it.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.597
What does that mean?

07:03.640 --> 07:06.861
It means, just
sit back and chill

07:06.904 --> 07:09.690
while I find out
if anybody knows anything.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.518
Okay. What if no
one's willing to talk?

07:11.561 --> 07:13.476
Dave, come on.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.740
These are decent, stand-up guys
that want to do the right thing.

07:16.784 --> 07:20.048
Plus, if they don't,
I got dirt on all them fools.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.575
Merry Christmas, everybody.

07:25.619 --> 07:26.968
ALL:
Hey, Calvin.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.448
Hey, uh, listen up, y'all.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.362
My man Dave here...

07:30.406 --> 07:31.581
Oh, we're losing time!

07:31.625 --> 07:33.975
I want answers,
and I want 'em now!

07:35.672 --> 07:37.674
What are you doing?I'm coming out the cut!

07:37.718 --> 07:40.982
Now, no one is
leaving this room

07:41.025 --> 07:44.159
until I find out who
took my son's scooter!

07:52.776 --> 07:54.778
Starting now!

08:01.002 --> 08:02.656
All right, now listen up. Some
sticky-fingered dirtbag broke

08:02.699 --> 08:05.789
into my garage and disappeared
my kid's Christmas present.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.444
So one of you canaries
better start singing

08:08.488 --> 08:10.011
real quick!

08:11.795 --> 08:16.931
Look, what Bugsy Malone
is trying to say

08:16.974 --> 08:18.323
is that he got robbed
last night,

08:18.367 --> 08:20.325
and we could use some help.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.284
Sorry, Calvin.
I haven't heard anything.

08:22.327 --> 08:23.981
How about y'all?

08:25.417 --> 08:28.116
Okay.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.858
I see how it is.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.729
I'll play your little game.

08:34.992 --> 08:37.342
Somebody talk,
or I'll mess up his hairline!

08:40.563 --> 08:42.957
Dave, stay away
from Randall's fade

08:43.000 --> 08:45.002
before you get
your ass whupped.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.876
Look, we all connected
to the streets.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.660
Somebody in here
heard something.

08:50.704 --> 08:53.010
I heard something.See, Dave?

08:53.054 --> 08:57.058
Black Google-- the World Wide
Web of nosey people.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.060
What you got, Trey?

08:59.103 --> 09:03.368
Okay, word is,
James is cheating on his girl.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.501
What's that got
to do with it?

09:05.545 --> 09:06.937
I don't know.
I just don't like James.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.856
Come on, guys.

09:12.900 --> 09:16.164
This is a kid's Christmas
present we're talking about.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.819
This is not how we do things
around here.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.038
I mean, Que,
every Christmas Eve,

09:21.082 --> 09:23.606
you give away free haircuts
to the homeless.

09:23.650 --> 09:27.392
And Trey, how many bikes
have we put together for kids

09:27.436 --> 09:29.612
so they can have something
under their tree?

09:29.656 --> 09:31.396
Seventy-five.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.616
76 if you count mine.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.098
Exactly.

09:37.141 --> 09:40.623
'Cause in this neighborhood,
we take care of each other.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.408
Especially during
this time of year.

09:43.452 --> 09:47.064
So one of you wise-apples
better spill the beans,

09:47.108 --> 09:49.589
or I'm cracking skulls!

09:51.460 --> 09:53.941
If nobody talks,

09:53.984 --> 09:55.856
I'm leaving him here.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.685
Yo, yo, Calvin,
come here.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.208
What's up?

10:00.251 --> 10:01.862
All right, look.

10:01.905 --> 10:05.082
Now you ain't heard this from
me, but I have a colleague

10:05.126 --> 10:07.215
that's in the same line
of business as myself.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.652
Oh, so, a hustler
that sells stolen stuff?

10:09.696 --> 10:12.655
That's hurtful...
but not untrue.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.485
Anyway, if anybody's got
your scooter, it's him.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.052
This is where
you can meet him.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.140
All right, got it.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.228
All right, come on,
Dave, let's go.

10:20.271 --> 10:22.273
Right behind you.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.667
Oh, and, uh...

10:24.711 --> 10:27.670
I didn't mean to be so tough
with you guys.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.933
Sorry if I scared anybody.

10:33.154 --> 10:34.938
♪ That time of year

10:34.982 --> 10:36.984
♪ Has come again...

10:38.942 --> 10:42.990
I thought you said you got
rid of these sweaters.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.121
I tried, man.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.558
But for some reason,
they wouldn't burn.

10:48.778 --> 10:52.086
Okay, I made some hot cocoa,

10:52.129 --> 10:54.131
just the way
you used to like it.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.393
Aw.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.395
This is ridiculous.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.310
I know. There aren't even
any marshmallows in here.

11:00.964 --> 11:04.576
Okay, so let's see how
your ornaments are doing.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.753
Ooh, Malcolm.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.842
You've got the googly-eyes
on your reindeer

11:08.885 --> 11:10.060
centered perfectly.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.845
Yeah.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.978
Now that I'm not six,
I'm not eating the glue, either.

11:15.022 --> 11:18.068
Oh, Marty, what are you
spelling out with your macaroni?

11:18.112 --> 11:19.679
Oh, uh, it says,

11:19.722 --> 11:21.463
"Help."

11:23.770 --> 11:26.076
As in "Santa's little helper"?

11:26.120 --> 11:28.252
Sure.

11:29.732 --> 11:30.994
Okay, Ma,
you know what?

11:31.038 --> 11:33.257
This has been fun,
but I think I am done.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.042
Yeah, Mom, me, too.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.913
W-W-Wha-- No.
W-We're just getting started.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.219
You haven't finished
your ornaments

11:38.262 --> 11:40.003
or made the popcorn string
for the tree.

11:40.047 --> 11:42.092
Yeah, I know, Mom, but that's
tuff we did when we were kids.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.920
Yeah, we're too grown
for this.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.269
Well, says who?

11:45.313 --> 11:48.142
Says the man wearing
a Christmas crop top.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.496
Okay, fine.

11:54.539 --> 11:55.932
I mean, if you're too grown

11:55.976 --> 11:57.673
to spend time
with your mother,

11:57.717 --> 12:00.807
I'll just go somewhere where
they have Christmas spirit.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.504
GIRL:
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Butler.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.158
Ah, shut up.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.424
Oh, man, she is mad.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.121
Yeah, I know.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.644
We really screwed up.

12:12.688 --> 12:13.950
Yeah.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.778
Hey, you gonna
drink your cocoa?

12:15.822 --> 12:18.476
You touch my cocoa and you're
getting a macaroni up your nose.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.308
This is ridiculous.

12:24.352 --> 12:27.050
Jeremiah said the guy would
meet us here over an hour ago.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.923
Right. Because guys who hang out
in back alleys

12:29.966 --> 12:33.230
selling stolen goods
are known for being punctual.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.406
Help!

12:35.450 --> 12:37.017
Help me, please.

12:37.060 --> 12:39.802
Somebody just ran off
with my donation bucket.

12:39.846 --> 12:43.371
See that? Even Santa
gets jacked around here.

12:43.414 --> 12:46.374
C-Can one of you
please call the police?

12:46.417 --> 12:48.768
Oh, yeah.
I-I got you, Santa.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.247
Never mind.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.423
Looks like you're good.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.469
They're not cops!
Open up!

13:00.301 --> 13:01.781
You're the guys
we've been waiting for?

13:01.824 --> 13:02.956
That's right.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.045
Welcome to Santa's workshop.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.053
Oh,
look, Grover,

13:13.096 --> 13:16.186
you made a little
gingerbread family.
Yeah.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.146
This is me, this is you,
and this is Dad.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.844
Aw. And who are you making
over there, Tina?

13:21.888 --> 13:23.498
Two ungrateful sons.

13:25.021 --> 13:28.372
Not so grown without your legs,
are you?

13:28.416 --> 13:32.812
Why don't we lay off the eggnog
for a little bit?

13:32.855 --> 13:35.510
You would think I
deserve one afternoon.

13:35.553 --> 13:39.079
Between the two of them,
36 hours of labor.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.908
And Marty was born
with that pumpkin head.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.171
Hey.
That was my dad.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.130
Don't worry, sweetie.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.132
We'll bake your father
a new head.

13:49.176 --> 13:52.353
I'm sorry, Gemma,
I'm trippin'.

13:52.396 --> 13:55.095
It's okay. We all
trip sometimes.

13:55.138 --> 13:57.227
You know, it's just,
when your kids are little,

13:57.271 --> 13:59.839
you don't realize some
traditions don't go on forever.

13:59.882 --> 14:03.103
I know, but at least
you have those memories.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.627
Do you really want to ruin them
for the three of you?

14:05.670 --> 14:06.846
And us.

14:09.065 --> 14:12.242
Mm. Show me which
cookie is you again.

14:12.286 --> 14:13.243
I'm still hungry.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.380
So what are you
gentlemen interested in

14:19.423 --> 14:21.034
this holiday season?

14:21.077 --> 14:23.471
Electronics? Jewelry?

14:23.514 --> 14:25.299
Maybe a pet?

14:27.736 --> 14:29.042
You got animals in there?

14:29.085 --> 14:30.652
Not at this location.

14:30.695 --> 14:33.263
But I can have a kangaroo here
in 20 minutes.

14:33.307 --> 14:36.353
I'm not interested
in kangaroos.

14:36.397 --> 14:37.572
At least not right now.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.749
I'm looking for
a stolen scooter.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.142
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We don't use

14:42.185 --> 14:43.665
the word "stolen" around here.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.319
Santa's on probation.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.190
We're done here.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.931
H-H-Hold on, hold on.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.541
What-What my friend meant

14:50.585 --> 14:52.674
is that we're looking
for a scooter

14:52.717 --> 14:57.461
that may have recently
fallen off Santa's sleigh.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.899
Okay.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.117
You're in luck.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.858
I just got one in
this afternoon.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.338
Hold on.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.601
I think it's in
"sporting goods."

15:08.342 --> 15:11.345
See, Dave? I told you
we'd get your scooter back.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.824
Great.

15:12.868 --> 15:16.002
I have to buy back a scooter
that I already paid for.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.525
Look, I hear you.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.831
But won't it all be worth it
on Christmas morning

15:19.875 --> 15:21.746
when you see the look
on Grover's face?

15:21.790 --> 15:24.271
SANTA:
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

15:25.663 --> 15:27.230
What is that?

15:27.274 --> 15:28.318
It's your scooter.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.712
Every kid wants one of these.

15:32.235 --> 15:35.064
Are you kid-- Santa,
that is not my scooter.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.545
All right, Dave,
it's not the exact one,

15:37.588 --> 15:41.070
but Grover will never grow out
of this one.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.334
You know, I knew this was
a waste of time.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.336
All right, look.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.859
We'll just go back
to the barbershop...

15:47.903 --> 15:49.557
No, Calvin,
it's Christmas Eve,

15:49.600 --> 15:51.211
and I don't have
a gift for my son.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.387
No more barbershops,

15:53.430 --> 15:54.866
no more sketchy alleys,

15:54.910 --> 15:58.174
no more Santas and
their stolen kangaroos.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.829
Hey, I came by
those kangaroos honestly.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.311
Hey, uh...

16:04.354 --> 16:06.922
Just window shopping here,
but much would one

16:06.966 --> 16:09.707
of them mid-size marsupials
go for?

16:17.541 --> 16:19.152
Oh, hey, boys.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.415
You know, I just
wanted to, um...

16:22.938 --> 16:24.070
What are you doing?

16:24.113 --> 16:25.941
Finishing up
our ornaments.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.116
Yeah. See?

16:28.813 --> 16:30.163
"We're so" what?

16:30.206 --> 16:32.426
Oh, uh, it's supposed to say
"We're sorry"

16:32.469 --> 16:35.864
but I lost circulation
in my arms and I had to stop.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.302
You know what?

16:39.346 --> 16:41.217
I'm the one who
should be sorry.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.741
You're right,
you're both adults,

16:43.785 --> 16:46.309
and I shouldn't force you
to do what you don't want to.

16:46.353 --> 16:49.399
Mom, it's not that we don't like
celebrating Christmas with you.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.836
Yeah, but maybe we can figure
out some new traditions.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.275
Ones that are more age
and, uh, size appropriate.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.408
Like what?

16:58.452 --> 17:00.280
I don't know.
We could go down to Ernie's bar,

17:00.323 --> 17:02.064
do a little Christmas karaoke.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.805
Oh, that sounds good to me.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.373
Well, you know, I wouldn't
mind a holiday cocktail.

17:06.416 --> 17:09.332
Gemma's eggnog
is all egg and no nog.

17:12.466 --> 17:13.815
Okay, so what do you say?

17:13.858 --> 17:15.338
Do we have a new tradition?

17:16.339 --> 17:17.384
I would love that.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.038
Well, all right.
Let's do it.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.430
Come on.
Let's go.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.084
Yeah.
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.651
Let me get these scissors.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.653
I got to cut off
those tight-ass sweaters.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.356
I'm sorry, Dave.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.445
I really thought this would
have ended differently.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.317
I mean, you with
your scooter back,

17:37.360 --> 17:39.797
and me with a pet I could box.

17:41.451 --> 17:44.498
Yeah, I'm just disappointed.

17:44.541 --> 17:45.890
Yeah, me, too.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.327
I really wanted to help make

17:47.370 --> 17:50.417
Grover's first Christmas here
special.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.333
Oh, hey, it's the
guys from the shop.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.988
Hey, fellas.
What y'all doing here?

17:57.032 --> 17:59.426
We came to bring you this.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.341
Oh, it's my scooter.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.952
Yeah, we tracked it down
after you left the shop.

18:03.995 --> 18:06.085
Yeah, Calvin, we heard what
you said about the holidays.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.434
Yeah, it made me think back

18:07.477 --> 18:09.653
to that year when
the neighborhood chipped in

18:09.697 --> 18:11.481
so I could spend Christmas
with my family.Oh, yeah.

18:11.525 --> 18:12.830
That bail wasn't cheap.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.137
Like you said, Calvin,

18:15.181 --> 18:16.573
we got to look out
for each other,

18:16.617 --> 18:18.053
especially this time of year.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.360
Well, all right.

18:20.403 --> 18:23.102
I don't want to overstate it,

18:23.145 --> 18:25.104
but looks like
I saved Christmas.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.760
Oh, man, I-I don't know how
I can thank you guys.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.762
This is the best gift
a guy could get.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.895
Merry Christmas, Dave.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.071
Eh, so where'd you guys
get this?

18:37.681 --> 18:40.119
Oh, now, Dave,
that is one question

18:40.162 --> 18:41.729
Black Google won't answer.

18:43.252 --> 18:45.689
Thank you.
Yeah.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.309
Hey, Dave, come on outside!

18:58.180 --> 18:59.834
Whoa, snow.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.141
Like back
in Michigan.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.274
Calvin, what is all this?

19:05.318 --> 19:06.623
I told you, I wanted to make

19:06.667 --> 19:08.451
your first Christmas here
special.

19:08.495 --> 19:11.150
Aw, Merry Christmas, Tina.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.154
Hey, what'd you guys
end up doing last night?

19:15.197 --> 19:17.243
Well, we started a new
Butler Christmas tradition.

19:17.286 --> 19:18.983
Yeah. Karaoke, drinking,

19:19.027 --> 19:21.116
and finding out Mom
is great at darts.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.511
Yeah, she's not just great,
she's a hustler.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.295
She took me
for almost 50 bucks.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.254
Ooh.Well, you're the one

19:28.297 --> 19:30.560
who said you were a grown-up.
Take it like a man.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.043
Calvin, this is amazing.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.740
W-Where'd you get
the snow machine?

19:36.784 --> 19:39.047
Well, after you got
your scooter back,

19:39.090 --> 19:41.528
I paid another visit
to Santa's workshop.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.791
The kangaroos
were all sold out,

19:43.834 --> 19:45.619
so I got this snow machine.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.841
Thanks, buddy.

19:50.885 --> 19:51.842
Merry Christmas.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.975
Merry Christmas, bud.

19:54.018 --> 19:57.457
So what do you say?
Snowball fight?

19:57.500 --> 19:58.545
Ah, no.

19:58.588 --> 19:59.894
That's for the kids, man.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.417
All right.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.423
Hey.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.817
What can I say?
I'm a kid at heart.
