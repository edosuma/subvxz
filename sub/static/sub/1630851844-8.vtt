00:04.922 --> 00:08.133
You know what I love most
about McGee Family Movie Night?

00:08.217 --> 00:10.260
Recreating the theater experience!

00:12.513 --> 00:14.890
Uh, sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn that off.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.100
See? Movie magic.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.894
<i>And just like the movies,</i>

00:20.771 --> 00:22.981
<i>I snuck in my own snacks!</i>

00:23.065 --> 00:23.941
Good news!

00:24.024 --> 00:26.735
Scratch and I found
the scariest movie ever!

00:26.818 --> 00:27.736
It has a ghost!

00:27.819 --> 00:31.156
And there's nothing scarier than ghosts!

00:31.240 --> 00:33.325
Especially when they chew
with their mouths open.

00:33.951 --> 00:37.746
I'm gonna have nightmares for weeks...
I can't wait! Hit play!

00:37.829 --> 00:39.540
<i>-Muah-ha-ha-ha!</i>

00:39.623 --> 00:42.501
- That wasn't even scary!

00:42.584 --> 00:43.794
Too many talking heads,

00:43.877 --> 00:45.754
- not enough severed heads!
Yeah,

00:45.837 --> 00:48.090
and those ghost stereotypes?

00:48.173 --> 00:50.425
Answer me this, Molly,
do I talk like this all the time?

00:50.634 --> 00:53.262
Get out of the house!

00:53.345 --> 00:55.347
- Sometimes you do.
- Eh, that's just for effect, but...

00:55.430 --> 00:57.724
We could probably make
a better movie ourselves.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.227
That is a great idea!

01:00.310 --> 01:01.687
Let's make a horror movie!

01:01.770 --> 01:04.022
- I mean, we've got a real ghost!
- I'll do it!

01:04.106 --> 01:07.359
And it'll be the performance
of an after-lifetime!

01:07.442 --> 01:08.944
I will direct, obviously.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.487
Libby can write the script.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.531
And Darryl, you can film it on your phone.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.951
I didn't get the phone
with six cameras for no reason!

01:16.034 --> 01:17.953
Let's make some movie magic!

01:19.997 --> 01:22.124
Are we sure Libby's not a ghost?

01:22.207 --> 01:24.960
Because her script is spooky accurate.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.046
- Uh-huh. Put this on.
Ugh. So degrading.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.090
- Great work, Libby!
- Ahh!

01:30.173 --> 01:32.134
Your script's great,
the set's even better.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.885
Now, try on your costume.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.637
But that's for Angela.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.473
Yes, and who better to bring Angela
to life than you,

01:38.557 --> 01:41.643
the writer who created her! Right?

01:41.727 --> 01:44.354
- Also, you're the only person available.
- Oh, no, no, no. Molly...

01:44.438 --> 01:46.064
the very thought of people watching me...

01:46.148 --> 01:48.609
on screen... in HD...

01:48.692 --> 01:50.777
makes me...

01:50.861 --> 01:53.030
- Ah, you'll be fine.
- Molly, where do you want the blood?

01:53.530 --> 01:57.451
Okay, um, do, do we really need blood
in a ghost movie?

01:57.534 --> 01:59.244
You know what? I'll surprise you.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.163
Boo.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.373
- Who's playing the ghost?
- Oh! Him?

02:03.457 --> 02:06.710
That's... our Canadian cousin Carl.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.504
Yeah, I'm the ghost... eh.

02:09.588 --> 02:10.589
He's visiting.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.925
Okay, gather around, crew! Gather around!

02:14.009 --> 02:16.261
We are here for one reason

02:16.345 --> 02:17.638
and one reason only...

02:17.888 --> 02:20.098
to make the scariest ghost movie ever!

02:20.182 --> 02:23.226
Sure, we're just kids with a camera phone
and cardboard props,

02:23.393 --> 02:26.188
but we've got something Hollywood doesn't!

02:26.271 --> 02:27.356
We've got...

02:27.439 --> 02:29.775
to be home for dinner!
So let's get shooting!

No, seriously.

03:29.835 --> 03:30.877
Get out.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.588
Making movies is hard.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.590
I barely got to use my fake blood!

03:35.674 --> 03:36.842
- Listen up, Fandreas.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.845
Warm winds are blowing this spring,
that's why I stay cool with...

03:39.928 --> 03:44.057
Whoa! Someone call the police!
There's a fashion crime in progress.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.353
We're making a ghost movie, Andrea.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.188
Shut up!

03:50.272 --> 03:51.648
I love horror movies!

03:51.732 --> 03:52.649
Totally unrelated,

03:52.733 --> 03:55.569
did you know that
I'm a professional actress? See?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.821
Um, uh, we all know
where this is going, right?

03:58.655 --> 04:01.158

04:01.241 --> 04:04.035

04:04.119 --> 04:08.457
- She wants to star in our movie.
- I just had a crazy thought.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.877
- Andrea Davenport in our movie?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.755
- Molly McGee! You read my mind!
- Oof.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.631
Meet at the store warehouse
tomorrow morning.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.175
It's where we shoot our commercials

04:18.258 --> 04:20.093
so we've got all the sets
and equipment we need.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.887
- What?
- We're gonna make the best movie ever!

04:21.970 --> 04:23.430
Okay, love you! Bye!

04:23.513 --> 04:25.056
I told you...

04:26.308 --> 04:30.812
I don't know what to say but, you know,
I was kind of expecting a little more...

04:30.896 --> 04:32.147
Whoa!

04:32.230 --> 04:35.066
Now this is the star treatment I deserve!

04:35.650 --> 04:37.527
I call this my floor-gasbord.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.948
Okay, everybody, I...
It's all very impressive

04:42.032 --> 04:44.785
but don't be distracted
by the razzle-dazzle.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.162
Okay? We just gotta focus on our goal and...

04:48.997 --> 04:51.708
Sweet baby corn,
that chair has my name on it!

04:51.792 --> 04:53.502
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.921
Second is the Grand Canyon.
Third is a baby deer learning to stand.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.839
Are these tombstones real?

04:57.923 --> 05:00.008
- Ah! They don't even fall down!

05:00.592 --> 05:03.345
Can you believe this, Libby?
Our vision is coming to life!

05:03.428 --> 05:06.181
Yeah, so about that?
Andrea had a few notes on my script.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.557
- Okay.
-"The lead character should

05:07.641 --> 05:08.850
- be more relatable..."
- Why not?

05:08.934 --> 05:10.477
-"aspirational..."
- Sounds good.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.896
"beautiful,
but not know how beautiful she is."

05:12.979 --> 05:13.939
Is that a thing?

05:14.022 --> 05:17.025
Oh. "And also, her name should be Andrea."

05:17.108 --> 05:20.654
Okay. But who cares
what the main character's called,

05:20.737 --> 05:21.863
as long as the movie's great!

05:21.947 --> 05:24.449
Plus, now you don't have to be on camera!

05:24.533 --> 05:27.619
- Eh, that's true.
- See? It all works out for the best.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.293
Like a glove. Action!

05:35.377 --> 05:37.087
About to shoot my very first feature!

05:37.170 --> 05:39.005
Thanks to all my followers
for believing in me.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.674
This is for you, "Fandreas"!

05:40.757 --> 05:43.552
Uh, Andrea, I said "Action." You know?

05:47.222 --> 05:51.852
Maybe I shouldn't have taken this shortcut
through the scary woods!

05:51.935 --> 05:52.894
Cue the ghost!

05:54.187 --> 05:55.230
Line?

05:55.313 --> 05:57.816
Boo.
Right. Boo!

05:57.899 --> 05:59.109
Oh, no!

05:59.192 --> 06:02.404
The hitchhiker's ghost is coming
to eat my soul!

06:02.487 --> 06:05.448
Thank goodness I'm wearing
Swedish memory foam running shoes!

06:05.532 --> 06:07.492
Available now
at Davenport's Department store!

06:07.576 --> 06:08.702
Okay, that's a cut.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.203
Oh, come on!

06:10.287 --> 06:11.496
That was my best stuff!

06:11.580 --> 06:15.000
That was great Andrea, um,
but how about we stick to the script?

06:15.083 --> 06:18.295
Sorry, I just knew it was the natural spot
for product placement.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.589
Okay, I hear you, but, um...

06:20.672 --> 06:23.049
Maybe we, we don't do product placement?

06:23.133 --> 06:26.803
I mean you're the director,
but it is how we're paying for everything.

06:28.597 --> 06:29.598
Oh.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.099
Like this portable waffle-iron

06:31.182 --> 06:33.518
for that on the go breakfast
lover hard-pressed for time!

06:33.602 --> 06:35.020
I got one of those.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.188
How do you work this thing?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.191
I got this. Gerard!

06:40.400 --> 06:41.693
Gerard does all our commercials.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.154
He can work the camera,
and he knows my good side.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.488
Spoiler... it's both!

06:45.572 --> 06:47.782
You're replacing me? She can't do that!

06:47.866 --> 06:50.744
Well, you can still do
the behind-the-scenes footage.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.080
Can't wait to capture
how this all falls apart.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.541
Oh, I know how it hurts to fire family,

06:56.625 --> 06:59.669
but like my daddy says,
it gets easier every time.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.087
- What?
- What's important is we do

07:01.171 --> 07:04.007
- whatever it takes to realize my vision.
- You mean <i>my</i> vision.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.343
Yeah, that's what I said, my vision.
All right, Gerard,

07:06.426 --> 07:07.677
I'm ready for my close-up!

07:10.680 --> 07:12.849
Look, Andrea, we need to talk about...

07:12.933 --> 07:15.352
- One second. Libbs!
- Yeah, coming.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.145
Um, did you read my latest script?

07:17.228 --> 07:18.480
I addressed all your notes.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.107
And I super appreciate
you staying up all night,

07:21.191 --> 07:23.610
but we decided to go in a bold,
new direction...

07:24.319 --> 07:26.696
Ghost. Romance. <i>Gho-mance.</i>

07:26.780 --> 07:28.406
But that's not even scary!

07:28.490 --> 07:32.619
I mean, do ghosts "have to be scary"?
Why can't they be cute and cuddly?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.579
Because ghosts aren't cuddly!

07:34.663 --> 07:37.290
They're sick and twisted
and sometimes a little gassy!

07:37.374 --> 07:39.709
Especially after eating all
of craft services.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.505
Molly, do something!
- Okay.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.131
She's ruining our movie!

07:45.215 --> 07:49.511
Andrea, the whole point was
to make a horror movie.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.805
Yes! The horror comes
from the ghost spending

07:51.888 --> 07:53.765
an eternity having never found true love!

07:53.848 --> 07:54.683
That's it.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.977
Let's see how fast she can run
in those Swedish shoes!

07:57.143 --> 07:59.646
Look, I know this isn't the movie
we set out to make,

07:59.729 --> 08:02.941
but just think about how much better it is
with all this fancy equipment!

08:03.024 --> 08:05.485
You have sold us out
to corporate sponsors for what?

08:05.568 --> 08:06.861
A chair with your name on it?

08:06.945 --> 08:08.571
Leave the chair out of this!

08:08.655 --> 08:10.949
Things may have gotten
a little out of control,

08:11.032 --> 08:13.910
but as long as I'm the director,
it's still our movie!

08:13.994 --> 08:15.912
Molly, I'd like you
to meet a family friend,

08:15.996 --> 08:17.872
visionary director, Greta Gerwig!

08:17.956 --> 08:19.708
Hi. I'm Greta Gerwig.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.960
With Greta Gerwig attached,
we'll have no problem

08:22.043 --> 08:23.962
- getting international distribution!

08:24.462 --> 08:26.423
My chair, my beautiful chair!

08:28.591 --> 08:30.552
Ah, like a glove...

08:30.635 --> 08:32.721
Picture's up! Cameras are rolling!

08:32.804 --> 08:34.681
Ghosts are cuddly! And action!

08:48.528 --> 08:50.989
So, is this still <i>our movie?</i>

08:51.072 --> 08:53.116
No, Scratch. No, it isn't...

08:53.575 --> 08:58.747
In fact, I think it's time to show Andrea
just how scary ghosts can be.

08:58.830 --> 08:59.789
Yes!

08:59.873 --> 09:02.584
It's the role I've been dying to play!

09:06.963 --> 09:08.381
Gerard!

09:08.965 --> 09:11.509
- We're not doing scary anymore.

for movie night.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.391
