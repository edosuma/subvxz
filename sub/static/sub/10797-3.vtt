00:06.381 --> 00:12.012
Captain's log, stardate 41235.25.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.516
Our location, Planet Ligon ll,

00:15.682 --> 00:20.646
source of a rare vaccine needed
on Federation Planet Styris IV.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.982
Starfleet told me
to engage in a friendly visit

00:24.149 --> 00:29.154
and open treaty negotiations
to acquire this medicinal substance.

00:29.321 --> 00:33.325
- Standard orbit, sir.
- Lt Yar calling from cargo bay one.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.578
Standing by to beam
the Ligonian party aboard.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.788
On our way.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.749
You have the helm, Mr Data.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.090
Cargo one.

00:48.257 --> 00:51.176
- This should be interesting.
- Agreed.

00:51.343 --> 00:56.181
Not only are they closely humanoid,
but their history is similar to ours.

00:56.348 --> 01:00.018
A highly structured society
and they're exceedingly proud.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.817
They insist on using
their own transporter, sir.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.945
It's their way.
Do they have our coordinates?

01:10.112 --> 01:13.407
They have.
They're standing by for your signal.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.661
This is Capt Picard
aboard the Enterprise.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.956
Please do us the honour
of visiting our vessel.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.098 --> 01:40.767
I am Lutan.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.692
Capt Jean-Luc Picard.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.320
Welcome aboard.

01:53.530 --> 01:57.826
My officers. My second-in-command,
Cmdr William Riker.

01:57.993 --> 02:00.204
Ship's Counsellor, Deanna Troi.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.790
And my Security Officer,
Lt Natasha Yar.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.419
A woman?
Your Chief of Security?

02:08.586 --> 02:10.964
Yes, Lutan, that is her expertise.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.301
I am honoured to meet
your officers.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.762
This is my secondary, Hagon.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.931
A sample of the vaccine.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.017
My duty, Lutan. I'm required...

02:22.184 --> 02:23.852
Out of my way, woman!

02:27.856 --> 02:30.192
How interesting.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.445
May we prove as surprising to you.

02:42.621 --> 02:46.416
If I may suggest, sir,
no apology.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.711
In their view, it would weaken us.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.714
Nothing concealed.
Would you care to accept it?

02:52.881 --> 02:55.384
Unless you care
to examine it further.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.553
Absolutely not.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.975
This vaccine sample
is a gift of life.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.227
We are honoured at receiving it.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.731
Would you do us
the additional honour now

03:09.898 --> 03:12.317
of letting us entertain you?

03:12.484 --> 03:16.321
Yes. Please prepare it.
We shall join you shortly.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.745
I ask forgiveness.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.458
They are strange, alien beings.
You bear no fault.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.502
But the female?

03:30.669 --> 03:33.380
May be exactly what I have needed.

03:54.318 --> 03:57.404
Space, the final frontier.

03:59.156 --> 04:03.076
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

04:03.243 --> 04:07.331
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

04:09.166 --> 04:12.836
..to seek out new life
and new civilisations,...

04:13.754 --> 04:17.423
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:27.411 --> 05:31.415
Lutan, we are aware of many
of your planet's achievements,

05:31.582 --> 05:36.587
and its unique similarity to an
ancient Earth culture we all admire.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.714
On behalf of the Federation,

05:38.881 --> 05:43.594
I would like to present this token
of our gratitude and friendship.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.431
From China's Sung Dynasty.

05:47.598 --> 05:51.143
- Fourteenth century.
- Thirteenth century, sir.

05:51.310 --> 05:53.103
Ah, yes, indeed.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.813
A most thoughtful gift.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.857
We are pleased.

05:57.024 --> 06:01.945
We of Ligon have been
apprehensive about strangers.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.781
We're not technologically advanced
as you.

06:04.948 --> 06:08.118
Yet, we possess something
you do not.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.580
A vaccine,
which has been found to be

06:11.747 --> 06:16.210
an effective antidote against
your dreaded Anchilles fever.

06:16.376 --> 06:22.174
If you respect our customs,
and we see that respect,

06:22.341 --> 06:23.759
we will be friends.

06:23.926 --> 06:28.263
And we will make the antidote
available to all who need it.

06:34.603 --> 06:38.774
If you require respect from us,
I am sure that you will see it.

06:40.192 --> 06:43.987
Surrounded by such friendship,
I feel no need for my guards.

06:44.154 --> 06:48.200
I will return shortly.
Prepare to transport me then.

06:50.285 --> 06:53.372
If there is anything else,
any further courtesy?

06:53.539 --> 06:57.376
Would it be possible to see
one of your wondrous holodecks?

06:57.584 --> 07:01.171
We have heard how they are used
to train your officers.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.006
And for many other things.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.718
Cmdr Riker.
Would you and Troi demonstrate?

07:06.885 --> 07:11.306
Would it be possible
for Lt Yar to do so, Captain?

07:11.473 --> 07:14.601
Some demonstration
of defence training.

07:14.768 --> 07:19.189
You're intrigued with her
having security responsibilities.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.109
But these things
are not unusual with us.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.112
With us, it is the duty of women
only to own the land.

07:25.279 --> 07:28.615
And the duty of men
to protect and rule it.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.244
Much the same has happened
in human history, too.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.664
I'd like to do it, sir.

07:36.248 --> 07:40.794
- As a sign of respect, perhaps.
- Very well.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.964
This way, please.

08:05.277 --> 08:06.653
Aikido one.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.745
It won't move again
until my actions activate it.

08:14.953 --> 08:19.625
You can create people?
Without a soul?

08:19.791 --> 08:23.420
It's not a real person, Lutan.
It has no life.

08:23.587 --> 08:27.049
Everything it does
is controlled by computer.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.179
Who am l?

08:34.556 --> 08:36.558
Do you hear me?

08:41.522 --> 08:44.608
But it will feel real
when it hits you.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.966
A force like that
cannot come from an image, Lutan.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.218
Then you will show me, Hagon.

09:32.656 --> 09:36.159
Thank you, Lieutenant.
How very enlightening.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.703
Aikido, vanish.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.333
I could create two, even three.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.794
But, really, one is enough.

09:46.295 --> 09:50.132
As you fight with it,
it learns how to defeat you.

09:50.299 --> 09:53.594
Even the extraordinary Lt Yar?

09:55.304 --> 09:57.431
It forces us to keep improving.

09:58.682 --> 10:04.146
Your skill... impresses me.
I like you.

10:10.068 --> 10:13.488
Farewell, my new friends
of the noble Enterprise.

10:13.655 --> 10:17.159
Understanding has made friends
of many different people.

10:17.326 --> 10:18.827
We've had a good beginning.

10:18.994 --> 10:22.623
May I also extend
a personal farewell to Lt Yar.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.417
In your Federation terms...

10:27.377 --> 10:29.588
Picard to bridge. Red alert.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.931
Shields up,
photon torpedoes activated, sir.

10:39.097 --> 10:43.519
- What comm contact have we had?
- Their orbital control station.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.355
Make contact there
and on hailing frequencies.

10:46.522 --> 10:50.359
This is the Enterprise to Lutan
and the Ligonian government.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.819
You have committed
an unfriendly act.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.030
Insist you reply immediately.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.782
Photon torpedoes ready.

10:56.949 --> 11:01.036
Set them for a display blast
1 ,000 metres short of the surface.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.414
- Set.
- Fire.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.509
Where is their transporter beam?

11:15.676 --> 11:19.179
We've tried to trace it, sir,
but to no effect.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.015
It's similar
to early Starfleet efforts,

11:22.140 --> 11:26.311
but uses the Heglenian shift
to convert energy and matter in...

11:27.312 --> 11:30.774
Which is actually not important
at this time.

11:30.941 --> 11:35.237
This is Capt Picard
with a message to Lutan,

11:35.404 --> 11:38.574
whom I have
so far acknowledged as a friend.

11:38.782 --> 11:42.995
But you have now committed what our
laws regard as an attack upon us.

11:43.161 --> 11:47.291
Since you have visited our vessel,
you know the power of it.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.544
We insist that you reply
to this message.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.302
Opinion, Counsellor.
Will they injure Lt Yar?

11:58.468 --> 12:02.472
I believe not, sir.
They seem mainly curious.

12:03.098 --> 12:06.518
In the case of Lutan, however,
I did feel other needs.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.103
What kind of needs?

12:08.270 --> 12:11.690
Some sexual attraction
from all the males.

12:11.857 --> 12:14.902
Lt Yar is physically
very attractive.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.447
But with Lutan,
I felt something else.

12:18.614 --> 12:22.451
Something more like avarice
or ambition.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.498
- Other comments?
- If I may, sir?

12:28.415 --> 12:32.961
One of the things in the briefings
was their respect for patience.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.796
Strongly emphasised.

12:34.963 --> 12:39.301
You can see it in the precise,
ritualistic way they do things.

12:39.468 --> 12:41.845
I'm worried about Lt Yar, too, sir.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.681
But maybe we should wait them out.

12:47.726 --> 12:53.315
Stardate 41235.32. I am concerned.

12:53.482 --> 12:57.027
Over a full day of waiting
with no response from Lutan.

12:57.236 --> 13:01.448
We are testing whether they are
aware of our sensors probing them.

13:01.615 --> 13:06.036
We believe we have pinpointed
Lutan's government compound.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.205
The vaccine, sir.

13:08.372 --> 13:11.166
- Yes, Doctor?
- The vaccine.

13:12.751 --> 13:16.964
I'm a physician, I've seen death,
but not on the scale this could mean.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.342
You were testing
if you could replicate the vaccine.

13:20.509 --> 13:23.887
And we can't. The sample
works fine as an injection,

13:24.096 --> 13:27.057
but it becomes unstable
when we try to replicate it.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.560
You must get the vaccine
from the planet.

13:29.726 --> 13:33.564
- As much as you can. Immediately.
- I'm aware of that, Doctor.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.650
You've never had to watch
a patient die from this.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.819
That's true.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.532
But I have seen my share of death.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.911
Damn.

13:48.120 --> 13:52.416
Where are the calluses we doctors
are meant to grow over our feelings?

13:52.583 --> 13:55.669
Perhaps the good ones
never get them.

14:02.176 --> 14:05.053
May I speak to you about my son,
Wesley?

14:05.220 --> 14:08.765
What? Oh, yes. Alright.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.810
He's interested
in starship operations.

14:11.977 --> 14:16.732
Speaking as a mother, of course,
he seems quite knowledgeable.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.151
Well, yes, speaking as a mother.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.570
He's on the turbolift.

14:21.737 --> 14:24.907
Remember, you ordered him
to stay off of the bridge.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.505
Wesley?

14:41.673 --> 14:44.801
I haven't stepped one foot
on your bridge, Captain.

14:45.344 --> 14:48.472
Sir, I'll see
that he leaves immediately.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.182
No.

14:50.349 --> 14:52.351
No?

14:53.519 --> 14:57.898
Why don't you sit at ops
next to Lt La Forge?

14:58.065 --> 14:59.066
Sir?

15:00.359 --> 15:02.361
Is the whole ship deaf?

15:02.986 --> 15:04.988
Sit down over there, young man.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.078
Temporarily.

15:14.289 --> 15:19.002
Captain, we have more information
from the briefing studies on Ligon.

15:20.295 --> 15:23.757
Oh, excuse me. Dr Crusher,
some of this may interest you.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.678
Let's hear the analysis.

15:27.845 --> 15:32.224
It is a highly structured society.
People live by strict codes.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.311
What Lutan did is similar
to what American lndians once did

15:36.478 --> 15:38.355
called counting coup.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.817
That is from an obscure language
known as French.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.486
Mr Data, the French language,

15:44.653 --> 15:47.990
for centuries on Earth,
represented civilisation.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.451
Indeed? But surely, sir...

15:51.618 --> 15:54.079
I suggest you drop it, Mr Data.

15:57.624 --> 16:03.005
Yes, sir. Counting coup could be
touching an enemy with a stick,

16:03.172 --> 16:05.883
or taking something from him
and escaping.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.302
It was considered extremely heroic.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.471
Lutan considers himself heroic,

16:11.638 --> 16:14.975
risking everything
in the face of our superior power.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.854
It fits Lutan's personality profile
as well.

16:19.021 --> 16:22.024
He has an abnormally high need
for achievement.

16:22.232 --> 16:26.570
Self-image to him is a function
of what he thinks he's achieved.

16:26.737 --> 16:32.075
Those who set their standards
too high can kill to meet them.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.327
Why Tasha?

16:33.494 --> 16:38.624
As a Starfleet Security Officer,
she represented his riskiest prize.

16:38.790 --> 16:42.711
Transmission from planet surface.
Main viewer on.

16:43.921 --> 16:48.300
- Well, Lutan, what do you want?
- Display your image, please.

16:48.509 --> 16:52.387
What is required
is an image of Lt Yar, well and...

16:52.554 --> 16:54.681
Are you making demands, Captain?

16:54.848 --> 16:56.850
Sir.

17:00.604 --> 17:03.023
According to
the Ligon code of honour,

17:03.190 --> 17:05.442
Lutan has done
what he set out to do,

17:05.608 --> 17:08.569
achieve recognition
for being daring and bold.

17:08.737 --> 17:12.074
We've studied this
in some depth now, sir.

17:12.281 --> 17:17.412
The proper thing for you to do now
is to ask to get Tasha back.

17:17.579 --> 17:20.040
Ask for her?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.084
Politely, Captain.

17:30.926 --> 17:36.056
And now, Lutan, you have boldly
taken Lt Yar from us.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.225
We ask that...

17:39.476 --> 17:41.687
That you now please return her.

17:43.188 --> 17:47.776
Then come visit us, Captain.
And we shall return her to you.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.409
Commander.

17:55.576 --> 17:57.494
Commander?

17:57.661 --> 18:01.456
- That's quite formal.
- So is this request, sir.

18:02.791 --> 18:07.880
We believe it would be preferable
if the Captain led this away party.

18:08.088 --> 18:12.134
Agreed, sir. Their customs
about guests make it preferable.

18:12.301 --> 18:15.345
I'm very much against that idea.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.056
Lutan is clearly a liar,
and devious.

18:18.223 --> 18:21.518
Counsellor Troi believes
he is capable of killing.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.646
It is my duty
to keep the Captain from danger.

18:24.813 --> 18:27.232
But Ligonian custom makes it clear

18:27.399 --> 18:30.110
that a visiting leader
is an honoured guest.

18:30.319 --> 18:34.615
Not us, not second-in-command.
Him.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.700
And the custom requires

18:36.867 --> 18:39.786
that Lutan should die
rather than violate that.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.461
Yes, it seems reasonable,
put that way.

18:47.628 --> 18:52.716
But I warn you, if you get hurt,
I'll put you on report, Captain.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.027
Welcome to my centreplace,
Capt Picard.

19:12.945 --> 19:16.240
Consider yourselves
my honoured guests.

19:16.406 --> 19:19.618
Every hospitality
will be accorded you.

19:19.785 --> 19:22.454
This is my first one, Yareena.

19:22.621 --> 19:27.042
Lutan is a fortunate man.
You've met Counsellor Troi.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.795
As on your vessel,
you have only to name

19:29.962 --> 19:32.047
whatever courtesy we can provide.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.883
Then, sir,
the courtesy of seeing Lt Yar.

19:35.008 --> 19:38.136
Lt Yar will be returned
to you tonight

19:38.303 --> 19:41.431
at a banquet
I have arranged in your honour.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.477
I'd like to see her now.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.896
Bring Lt Yar.

19:48.063 --> 19:50.858
I find it odd
that a man of your experience

19:51.024 --> 19:54.778
has such difficulty in understanding
ordinary politeness.

19:54.945 --> 19:59.032
The politeness of saying please
before abducting someone?

19:59.199 --> 20:04.329
The expression "please" is used
only when requesting the person back.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.874
Yours is a different world.

20:07.040 --> 20:11.795
With clear and simple ways
deeply rooted in our culture.

20:12.004 --> 20:17.759
If you are willing to ask
for Lt Yar's return tonight,

20:17.926 --> 20:21.972
in front of all,
honour will be satisfied.

20:23.390 --> 20:26.810
One can see the importance
of honour here, sir.

20:26.977 --> 20:29.771
Honour is everything.

20:37.196 --> 20:39.865
Have you been treated well,
Lieutenant?

20:39.990 --> 20:41.992
Fine, Captain.

20:42.159 --> 20:44.745
But they're showing
some signs of wear.

20:44.912 --> 20:49.124
There isn't any need for concern.
She's been well cared for.

20:49.291 --> 20:53.712
My ship's company and I
are certain of your wisdom in that.

20:53.879 --> 20:56.965
For a moment,
I thought I heard a threat implied.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.343
But that would be foolishness.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.721
Something to be avoided, I agree.

21:02.930 --> 21:06.642
The festivities for her return to you
are in preparation.

21:06.808 --> 21:10.312
- Shall we retire till then?
- Until tonight, Lutan.

21:43.303 --> 21:48.559
You have granted us hospitality
and the safety of your centreplace.

21:48.725 --> 21:53.355
The gifts you give us are rare
and precious. We thank you.

21:54.690 --> 21:59.570
And now, according to the customs
of your ancestors,

21:59.736 --> 22:02.573
whom we honour and respect,...

22:03.490 --> 22:07.536
..l am here in peace
to ask for the return of Lt Yar.

22:09.663 --> 22:13.709
Well spoken. There are those
among my equals here

22:13.876 --> 22:16.879
who were wary
of my approaching the Federation.

22:17.045 --> 22:20.507
I am proud to have taken
this step toward a treaty.

22:20.716 --> 22:24.553
And proud that we have something
of great value to offer you.

22:24.720 --> 22:28.307
A priceless, life-giving vaccine.

22:29.474 --> 22:34.188
The abduction I have done according
to our custom for all to see.

22:37.691 --> 22:41.904
Your conduct in this matter has been
beyond exemplary, Capt Picard.

22:42.070 --> 22:48.327
But now that the moment has come,
I find that I cannot part with her.

22:50.746 --> 22:52.873
You speak of a code of honour.

22:53.040 --> 22:56.835
But what you are saying now,
by our customs, is an act of war.

22:57.002 --> 23:00.297
This is not an act of war,
but of love.

23:01.673 --> 23:04.176
I want Lt Yar
to become my first one.

23:04.343 --> 23:06.678
I challenge your right to supersede.

23:06.845 --> 23:09.264
No woman has challenged
for 200 years!

23:09.431 --> 23:11.683
The right is mine
and I will have it!

23:11.892 --> 23:15.854
Natasha Yar, I challenge you.
A struggle to the death.

23:16.021 --> 23:20.567
No! The challenge
is unequivocally refused.

23:20.734 --> 23:25.989
Then you shall have no treaty,
no vaccine, and no Lt Yar!

23:30.118 --> 23:32.621
Ship's log,
First Officer Riker reporting.

23:32.788 --> 23:35.624
We have been informed
of the challenge to Lt Yar

23:35.791 --> 23:38.126
and are maintaining
combat readiness.

23:38.335 --> 23:43.674
We are probing Lutan's compound
with our sensors, still unnoticed.

23:50.055 --> 23:52.224
Captain. Deanna.

23:54.810 --> 23:58.021
Did you have any idea
that Lutan was going to announce

23:58.188 --> 24:01.400
that he wanted you
for his first one?

24:01.567 --> 24:02.901
No, sir.

24:04.027 --> 24:06.613
Tell me what you know about this.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.365
Nothing, sir.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.451
But it was a thrill.

24:12.494 --> 24:17.749
Lutan is such...
such a basic male image.

24:17.916 --> 24:20.127
And having him say he wants you...

24:20.294 --> 24:23.922
Yes, of course, it made me feel good,
when he...

24:25.883 --> 24:28.552
Troi, I'm your friend,
and you tricked me!

24:29.094 --> 24:33.557
Only so you'd think about it,
completely and clearly.

24:33.724 --> 24:37.936
We're all being manipulated,
Lieutenant. Myself most of all.

24:38.103 --> 24:41.648
How simple all this would be
without the Prime Directive.

24:43.859 --> 24:47.112
That thought
had passed through my mind.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.789
What is this message
from Starbase 1 4?

24:57.915 --> 25:02.377
It's showing the infection rates,
percentage illness increases.

25:02.544 --> 25:06.590
The plague on Styris IV
has flared up out of control.

25:07.841 --> 25:11.303
They're estimating deaths
in the millions, sir.

25:11.470 --> 25:12.971
Capt Picard, come in.

25:13.138 --> 25:15.265
I know I can win.

25:15.432 --> 25:18.101
Not that I'd take her life,
of course.

25:18.227 --> 25:20.604
But I'd be glad to embarrass her.

25:20.812 --> 25:24.066
The idea of accusing me
of taking...

25:26.777 --> 25:28.529
The plague?

25:28.695 --> 25:31.490
If anything,
even worse than we've heard.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.701
So they desperately
need the vaccine, sir.

25:34.868 --> 25:37.329
And I know I can win this challenge.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.499
You have nothing to prove here.

25:40.666 --> 25:43.544
But the vaccine
is important in this case, sir.

25:43.710 --> 25:48.298
You're the last person I'd expect
to argue for taking the challenge.

25:48.507 --> 25:52.386
Betazoid blood is also practical,
Captain.

25:52.553 --> 25:56.723
The odds are very good.
She'd defeat Lutan's wife easily.

25:56.890 --> 26:00.394
You'd win
all the bargaining points you need.

26:00.561 --> 26:01.770
The odds are...

26:01.937 --> 26:05.148
You have pointed out yourself,
we are all at risk,

26:05.315 --> 26:07.568
every day of every mission.

26:08.944 --> 26:11.405
I want some explanation from Lutan.

26:15.117 --> 26:19.705
Lutan, why are you
so obsessed with this Lt Yar?

26:19.872 --> 26:22.958
Surely Yareena is more desirable.

26:23.125 --> 26:26.086
Certainly,
she can offer you much more.

26:26.253 --> 26:29.173
She owns many things, many lands.

26:29.339 --> 26:33.886
It's a pity you began by abducting
my Security Officer, Lutan.

26:34.052 --> 26:36.471
Because I should tell you,

26:36.680 --> 26:40.434
I do admire the hospitality
you offer here.

26:40.601 --> 26:44.146
I am in the grip of forces
you do not understand.

26:44.313 --> 26:47.941
Some of it I do understand.
She is a rather lovely female.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.944
You surprise me, Captain.

26:51.111 --> 26:54.156
What do you know
of needs and feelings?

26:54.323 --> 26:59.786
Nothing. Well, almost nothing,
in my position as ship's Captain.

27:01.205 --> 27:02.664
I see.

27:04.374 --> 27:08.170
But it puzzles me.
If you feel like that for Tasha,

27:08.337 --> 27:11.423
why challenge her
to a fight to the death?

27:11.590 --> 27:15.928
Not l. Yareena.
I am merely a spectator.

27:16.094 --> 27:20.224
Ah, but you are also a man
of great importance and wealth.

27:20.390 --> 27:24.228
Great importance, perhaps,
but he does...

27:27.314 --> 27:29.316
Ah, I see.

27:29.483 --> 27:32.611
You, too, understand
the proper value of women.

27:32.778 --> 27:36.824
We understand
that they are highly pleasant things,

27:36.990 --> 27:39.576
but, after all, unimportant.

27:39.743 --> 27:42.538
Except for the land they own.

27:43.247 --> 27:45.999
You are a truly clever person,
Lutan.

27:47.125 --> 27:51.421
You stand to lose nothing,
either way the challenge goes.

27:51.588 --> 27:56.468
A code of honour protects one,
Captain, like a magic cloak.

27:57.427 --> 28:00.222
I will order Lt Yar to fight.

28:01.056 --> 28:05.227
And may your cloak bring you
all you deserve.

28:18.574 --> 28:19.950
Come in.

28:23.328 --> 28:28.500
Why that razor, not the one
I adjusted to perfect efficiency?

28:28.667 --> 28:31.378
Shaving is a human art form, Data.

28:31.545 --> 28:34.631
Technological perfection
can shave too close.

28:35.924 --> 28:39.803
Puzzling.
How can anything be too efficient?

28:39.970 --> 28:43.432
Thousands of things
are too efficient for humans.

28:43.599 --> 28:46.351
We always come back
to the human equation.

28:46.560 --> 28:50.063
Exactly.
Have you continued to work on it?

28:50.981 --> 28:52.983
Constantly, my friend.

28:54.234 --> 28:59.156
Particularly the humour.
A man goes to a store to buy kidneys.

28:59.323 --> 29:03.118
He says to the shopkeeper,
"I'd like a pound of kiddleys."

29:03.285 --> 29:05.787
The shopkeeper says,
"You mean kidneys."

29:05.954 --> 29:08.999
The man says,
"I said kiddleys, diddle l?"

29:10.125 --> 29:15.005
It's too old.
And you didn't tell it very well.

29:15.172 --> 29:17.841
How do you know
when something is funny?

29:17.966 --> 29:20.761
It's not explainable. You just do.

29:21.553 --> 29:23.347
Perhaps it is you, Geordi.

29:23.514 --> 29:28.018
Includling the kiddleys, I've told
662 jokes and you've not...

29:28.185 --> 29:31.730
"Includling the kiddleys."
Now, see, that's funny.

29:33.190 --> 29:35.025
It was not meant as a joke.

29:37.027 --> 29:39.029
The tongue slipped.

29:39.196 --> 29:41.657
Oh, boy.

29:41.824 --> 29:44.535
Riker to Cmdr Data, Lt La Forge.

29:44.701 --> 29:48.705
Report to the transporter room
for away-party duty.

29:53.460 --> 29:56.964
First Officer to Captain.
Ready with the away personnel.

29:57.130 --> 30:00.133
- Lock in on this location.
- Locked in, sir.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.718
Energise.

30:06.431 --> 30:08.350
You saw the news about the plague?

30:08.517 --> 30:11.186
And how badly the vaccine is needed.

30:11.311 --> 30:14.940
We need to know as much as possible
about Ligonian armaments.

30:15.107 --> 30:18.819
Data, analyse
their combat capabilities.

30:18.986 --> 30:22.239
Geordi,
concentrate on their cutting edges,

30:22.406 --> 30:24.950
durability, weaknesses in material.

30:25.117 --> 30:28.036
- Aye, sir.
- From any particular point of view?

30:30.038 --> 30:35.127
From the perspective of Lt Yar using
them in combat with Lutan's wife.

30:35.669 --> 30:37.671
Most interesting.

30:38.839 --> 30:42.134
Could this be human joke number 663?

30:42.301 --> 30:45.429
Negative, Data.
That's a Captain's order.

30:46.972 --> 30:50.934
Which makes it important to know
which weapons are to be used.

30:51.101 --> 30:54.229
That won't be known
until combat begins.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.902
You're right, Data.

31:00.068 --> 31:04.573
It does sound like a joke.
With the power of the Enterprise,

31:04.740 --> 31:08.619
we could overwhelm this place,
just take what we want.

31:08.785 --> 31:11.371
I may not understand humour, sir,

31:11.538 --> 31:13.916
but I am a Starfleet Academy
graduate.

31:14.082 --> 31:18.086
- Which means, of course?
- Understanding the Prime Directive.

31:18.295 --> 31:22.633
That is, ironically,
what this is about.

31:22.799 --> 31:27.054
By our standards, the customs here,
their code of honour,

31:27.221 --> 31:29.890
is the same pompous,
strutting charades

31:30.057 --> 31:33.060
that endangered our species
a few centuries ago.

31:33.227 --> 31:38.232
We evolved out of it because no one
tried to impose their own set of...

31:38.398 --> 31:40.442
Sorry. This is becoming a speech.

31:40.609 --> 31:43.612
You're the Captain. You're entitled.

31:43.821 --> 31:48.659
Not entitled to ramble on about
something everyone knows. Carry on.

31:50.911 --> 31:53.789
Ship's log,
Cmdr William Riker reporting.

31:53.956 --> 31:57.292
Continuing our appraisal
ofLigonian technology,

31:57.459 --> 32:00.420
the Captain
wants Lt Yar beamed to safety

32:00.587 --> 32:02.798
ifher life becomes endangered.

32:02.965 --> 32:06.969
I fervently hope the rules
of that contest make it possible.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.137
Riker to Transporter Chief.

32:09.346 --> 32:11.765
Do we have our people on sensors yet?

32:11.932 --> 32:15.435
Their general area, sir.
Visual on screen now.

32:15.602 --> 32:18.939
As you see,
we're still doing some fine-tuning.

32:20.899 --> 32:24.403
I've agreed to this meeting,
but I see no point to it.

32:24.570 --> 32:27.072
You accepted the challenge.

32:27.239 --> 32:32.286
You should know there is no physical
training that matches Starfleet,

32:32.452 --> 32:34.538
especially its Security people.

32:34.746 --> 32:38.709
And you should know that
even though these contests are rare,

32:38.876 --> 32:41.295
we make ourselves capable of them.

32:41.461 --> 32:45.883
Yareena, my acceptance
had nothing to do with Lutan.

32:46.049 --> 32:49.303
It has! Lutan wants you
to be his first one.

32:49.469 --> 32:53.265
Impossible, Yareena.
I am a career Starfleet officer.

32:53.432 --> 32:57.644
How could you not love him?
Every woman loves him.

32:58.270 --> 33:03.025
I fight for the vaccine.
That's the truth.

33:04.443 --> 33:08.322
The truth
is I will kill you if I can.

33:08.489 --> 33:11.033
And believe me, I can.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.202
There's nothing else to say!

33:13.368 --> 33:15.913
In my world,
it's a greater honour to refuse.

33:16.079 --> 33:18.165
You are on our world!

33:25.964 --> 33:27.841
Captain.

33:28.008 --> 33:33.013
I'm your Counsellor. You brought me
with you to Ligon to be of help.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.015
Then help me, please.

33:35.182 --> 33:37.184
What is a way out of this?

33:37.351 --> 33:39.353
- With the vaccine?
- Mm-hm.

33:40.270 --> 33:41.897
None.

33:44.441 --> 33:46.026
The weapons in that room

33:46.193 --> 33:49.696
are surprisingly flexible, durable
and deadly.

33:49.863 --> 33:52.991
And light. As if they were made
for women to use.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.661
Some still have traces
of blood and poison.

33:55.828 --> 33:59.581
- Poison?
- Alkaloid base. Lethal.

33:59.748 --> 34:03.252
What about those lengths of metal
in the yard?

34:03.418 --> 34:06.797
Uncertain, sir.
However, joined together,

34:06.964 --> 34:11.009
they would make a rectangle or square
enclosing 1 21 square metres.

34:11.176 --> 34:14.346
Vertically, they would make a pole
44 metres high.

34:14.513 --> 34:17.641
- Or two of 22.
- Thank you, Data.

34:17.850 --> 34:19.560
You're welcome, sir.

34:24.481 --> 34:28.902
She won't budge.
She loves him, without reservation.

34:29.444 --> 34:31.530
And she thinks I love him, too.

34:32.156 --> 34:34.741
Most interesting. Do you?

34:34.908 --> 34:37.578
Of course I don't, Data!

34:37.744 --> 34:42.123
As Troi pointed out, I'm attracted
to him, but that's different.

34:42.291 --> 34:45.460
- Riker to Captain.
- Go ahead, Riker, we're alone.

34:45.668 --> 34:50.716
We can see your hosts gathering
in the open area outside, sir.

34:50.882 --> 34:54.011
Three of them
are heading for your location.

34:54.178 --> 34:56.179
Thank you, Number One.

34:56.638 --> 35:01.435
Lieutenant, do you still want
to go through with this challenge?

35:01.602 --> 35:05.439
- Do you judge your condition good?
- I judge it excellent, sir.

35:12.946 --> 35:16.867
Your weapons, Lt Yar.
You may choose your size.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.637
Don't touch the spines.
They're poisoned.

35:36.845 --> 35:39.973
If you're not careful,
you could kill yourself.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.769
These I understand.

36:19.638 --> 36:22.182
First Officer's log supplemental.

36:22.349 --> 36:26.562
Capt Picard, faced with
a critical need for a vaccine,

36:26.770 --> 36:30.732
has permitted Lt Natasha Yar
to engage in a fight to the death.

36:30.899 --> 36:34.778
I have yet to understand
his reasoning or his plan.

36:34.945 --> 36:37.739
Care to lend a hand? Sit at ops.

36:51.461 --> 36:52.963
Was I seen leaving?

36:53.130 --> 36:56.049
They've got eyes
only for the programme.

36:56.216 --> 36:59.761
Capt Picard wanted no risk
of our being overheard.

36:59.928 --> 37:02.347
You are to proceed as he indicated.

37:02.514 --> 37:03.891
Captain's orders two!

37:04.057 --> 37:07.769
Did the Captain understand
what you and Geordi reported?

37:07.936 --> 37:10.522
The weapons are split-second lethal.

37:10.689 --> 37:13.400
I'm here to brief you
on what he plans.

37:26.205 --> 37:28.540
Any last-minute instructions, sir?

37:28.707 --> 37:31.668
Stay alive.
We'll hope to do the rest.

37:46.058 --> 37:50.103
I speak for Lutan.
The rules are known.

37:50.270 --> 37:53.190
Let combat continue
until there is a victor.

37:53.357 --> 37:55.651
It will not be interrupted.

38:45.075 --> 38:47.411
Combatants, hold your positions.

38:48.620 --> 38:50.622
Return the weapon.

39:20.861 --> 39:22.154
Careful, Yareena!

40:19.378 --> 40:20.963
Move!

40:22.840 --> 40:25.509
We're too late. She's growing cold.

40:25.634 --> 40:28.220
Sorry, that clashes
with my instructions.

40:28.929 --> 40:31.098
Oh, no!

40:35.018 --> 40:38.480
Exactly what do you find unfair,
Lutan?

40:38.647 --> 40:41.608
They fought to the death.
You saw the final blow.

40:41.817 --> 40:43.986
You know the effects of your poison.

40:44.153 --> 40:47.573
But what of your Lt Yar?
She is to become my first one now.

40:47.739 --> 40:51.451
I won't stop her,
if she cares to claim that honour.

40:51.618 --> 40:55.789
Remember, you have all
Yareena's wealth and lands now.

40:58.083 --> 41:00.335
At least all has not been lost.

41:00.502 --> 41:02.921
- Riker to Captain.
- Picard here.

41:03.088 --> 41:08.677
Since you fulfilled your agreement,
can we now beam the vaccine aboard?

41:08.886 --> 41:10.554
Yes, of course.

41:10.721 --> 41:14.808
No problem, Number One.
Send down a medical team.

41:14.975 --> 41:19.021
And to complete our business here,
we are locked on to you.

41:21.023 --> 41:23.025
Five to beam up. Energise.

41:34.953 --> 41:39.041
Welcome back, Captain.
You're wanted in the lounge.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.627
This way, gentlemen.

41:55.015 --> 41:58.602
She is not dead!
There was no death combat!

41:58.810 --> 42:00.771
You violated our agreement!

42:00.938 --> 42:03.690
There will be no treaty, no vaccine!

42:03.857 --> 42:07.319
The challenge was carried out.
She died, Lutan.

42:07.486 --> 42:10.155
There was no challenge. She lives!

42:10.322 --> 42:12.699
I am a physician and saw her die.

42:12.866 --> 42:16.995
If you doubt this poison,
why not test it on yourself?

42:17.162 --> 42:20.874
Lutan, we can provide you
with records of her death,

42:21.041 --> 42:23.293
and how Dr Crusher brought her back.

42:23.460 --> 42:27.589
At the instant of death, Lutan,
our mating agreement dissolves.

42:27.798 --> 42:32.177
But this is witchcraft, Yareena.
To discard a mate in this manner...

42:32.344 --> 42:36.223
Is less painful than the one
you selected for me.

42:39.101 --> 42:40.894
Yareena, no.

42:42.688 --> 42:47.401
Even as I battled, Hagon,
I heard you calling out for me.

42:51.029 --> 42:53.198
Yareena, be my first one.

42:53.740 --> 42:59.288
All my land and all my goods,
all I have is yours to rule.

43:01.540 --> 43:03.917
How sad for you.

43:04.084 --> 43:05.878
You've lost everything.

43:06.044 --> 43:07.880
I have my honour.

43:08.046 --> 43:11.466
It's... such a waste.

43:11.633 --> 43:12.885
Do you want him?

43:15.762 --> 43:17.431
No.

43:18.557 --> 43:23.228
There would... be complications.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.983
Then I will have you
as my number two.

43:28.150 --> 43:31.111
Take your place accordingly.

43:34.656 --> 43:37.075
Well, as you see, Captain,

43:37.242 --> 43:41.622
you may excel in technology,
but not in civilised behaviour.

44:01.391 --> 44:03.018
What?

44:04.144 --> 44:06.104
Wesley.

44:06.271 --> 44:10.609
Young Wesley has been manning
that station for me. I forgot.

44:10.984 --> 44:16.949
Well,... thanks again for manning
one of our bridge stations, Wesley.

44:17.115 --> 44:20.327
We'll see
that you have another chance.

44:20.494 --> 44:21.787
Yes, sir.

44:24.915 --> 44:28.377
What's the delay?
Why aren't we warping out of here?

44:29.503 --> 44:32.047
Set course for Styris IV, warp three.

44:32.256 --> 44:34.633
Course laid in for Styris IV, sir.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.301
Engage.
