WEBVTT

00:17.684 --> 00:20.270
is a lot larger than the middle school,

00:20.353 --> 00:22.772
and when you become a freshman next year,

00:22.856 --> 00:26.276
y-you'll have access
to some amazing facilities.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.237
Our science lab is state of the art.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.740
Well, at least it was.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.159
-Did it get destroyed in the fight?
-Uh, no.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.661
Uh, the district required us to remove

00:36.745 --> 00:39.622
anything that could potentially
be used as a weapon

00:39.706 --> 00:42.751
in the event of another karate incident.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.419
Okay, let's, uh…

00:45.295 --> 00:47.172
Okay, so, this way's the cafeteria.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.924
There actually was a fight there,
so it got ruined, but--

00:50.008 --> 00:51.968
Hey, new kid. What do you think?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.555
Me? What?

00:55.638 --> 00:58.725
The high school? I heard it's haunted.
Do you think that's true?

00:58.808 --> 01:01.019
Oh! Oh, definitely, yeah, yeah.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.605
Uh, actually, I died five years ago.

01:04.314 --> 01:07.692
Well, ghost boy, you got strawberry
on your snake shirt.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.862
You've been letting me
walk around like this?

01:10.945 --> 01:13.865
At first I thought
it was part of the evil-looking design.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.533
Then I realized you're just a slob.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.078
-Oh.
-Don't worry though.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.746
Nobody else can see you, right?

01:21.456 --> 01:22.499
Yeah.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.088
I'm telling you, we had a moment.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.299
Bullshit. No way
is Lexi DiMarco going out with you.

01:31.382 --> 01:34.803
-She's a junior.
-I know. She's a total J.I.L.F.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.680
-What's that?
-J.I.L.F. Junior I'd Like To--

01:37.764 --> 01:38.598
Whoa!

01:39.557 --> 01:41.476
Looks like someone's a little lost.

01:41.559 --> 01:44.521
Yeah. What makes you think
you can wear a shirt like that here?

01:44.604 --> 01:46.815
It… It's from my dojo.

01:47.649 --> 01:51.194
-Maybe they started a kindergarten class?
-Or a nursery.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.535
Look at him, running to mommy.
Bye, you little bitch.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.548
Thinking about striking first, huh?

02:11.631 --> 02:14.050
-I--
-Yeah. Word of advice, kid.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.052
Get out of Cobra Kai while you still can.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.097
'Cause they're about to go down.
And it's not gonna be pretty.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.522
Weako. I think he's gonna cry!

02:32.026 --> 02:32.861
Hai.

02:34.154 --> 02:34.988
Hai.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.323
Hai.

02:38.867 --> 02:39.701
Hai.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.370
Hai. Hai.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.289
Hai. Hai.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.541
Hai. Hai.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.334
Hai.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.044
Hai.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.173
-Attack!

02:53.673 --> 02:55.216
That's it. Attack!

02:55.300 --> 02:56.176


02:57.510 --> 03:00.013
-That's it.
-That's it. Hai.

03:00.096 --> 03:03.766
Hai. Hai. Hai. Hai.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.143
Oh shit!

03:05.226 --> 03:08.563
Um, I'm not gonna
get in any trouble, am I?

03:09.981 --> 03:14.110
All right, remember, one of the best ways
to get a point is to aim for the torso.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.155
-
-All right, front kick, side kick. Ready?

03:17.238 --> 03:18.573
-Huh?
-Go!

03:18.656 --> 03:20.033


03:20.617 --> 03:21.951
-
-Very nice.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.536
-Sorry.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.080
Nice kick, LaRusso!

03:26.164 --> 03:28.458
Remember, whip that foot
through the target.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.044
-Ready. Go!
-That's it.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.420


03:32.503 --> 03:34.672
Let all your aggression disappear.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.383


03:39.844 --> 03:41.012
Oh!

03:41.095 --> 03:45.808
-Oh shit. I missed. My bad, Meat.
-Very good. Suck it up. Tighten that core.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.811
Good day. You guys showed toughness.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.689
You sure you're okay?

03:51.773 --> 03:54.776
Oh yeah. No, they're starting
to turn back to their normal color.

03:54.859 --> 03:58.529
Diaz. You hungry? I'll make your favorite.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.490
Spicy Manwich, side of steak fries.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.826
I'm actually going with Mr. LaRusso.
We're finishing my mom's car.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.703
Oh, okay. No problem.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.123
Sensei.

04:09.749 --> 04:10.792
Ready when you are.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.969
Yo, guys.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.430
My boy Rory, he got some free tickets
to the drive-in tonight.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.016
They're going old school,
something called <i>Bloodsport</i>?

04:27.100 --> 04:30.603
I know that movie.
My dad left an old VHS at our place.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.814
It was the only evidence I had
that he existed.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.608
I heard it's dope.
So, if you guys are in, let's do this.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.610
Depends on how late
I have to work tonight.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.904
My new boss put me
on the schedule for today.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.115
Guy's a total creep.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.700
You got a new job? Where?

04:44.784 --> 04:46.703
-It's none of your business.
-Okay.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.455
Look who made it.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.793
What's up?

04:54.752 --> 04:56.462
I was at the high school yesterday

04:57.088 --> 04:59.090
and these older kids
started messing with me.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.676
One guy told me I should quit Cobra Kai.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.763
-Who was he?
-I don't know. He had this spiky red hair.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.018
-We still owe that Judas some payback.
-Hell yeah.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.144
Everyone fall in.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.570
As you know,
our enemies are working together.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.740
They are combining their styles
to beat us.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.284
But they are destined to fail.

05:26.784 --> 05:29.078
Because there is only one way.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.039
And what is that way?

05:31.122 --> 05:32.707
The Way of the Fist, sir!

05:32.790 --> 05:33.750
Exactly.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.669
However, that doesn't mean
that we can't double down.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.296
Class,

05:38.379 --> 05:40.548
meet Sensei Terry Silver.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.263
Co-founder of Cobra Kai

05:47.347 --> 05:50.767
and one of the most ferocious fighters
in the history of the sport.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.980
Together, we built Cobra Kai
from the ground up,

05:56.064 --> 05:59.692
and now he is here
to help you prepare for the All Valley.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.946
Thank you, Sensei Kreese.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.115
It's an honor to be here.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.494
With two senseis,
you will receive twice the instruction.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.496
That means twice the work.

06:11.579 --> 06:15.333
And if you are not prepared
to put in 200%,

06:15.416 --> 06:17.335
then you can leave right now.

06:17.418 --> 06:20.046
But if you dig in and follow our lead,

06:21.714 --> 06:23.674
we're gonna take you to the next level.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.603
Maybe you're just tired.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.607
I swear, this has never,
ever happened to me.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.275
Of course not.

06:42.276 --> 06:48.032
You know, working at the hospital,
I do have access to certain… medications.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.034
What? I don't need pills!

06:51.035 --> 06:53.204
I'm 100% all man.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.415
Okay then.

06:56.874 --> 06:57.959
What is it?

06:58.042 --> 07:00.044
I just can't get
LaRusso and Miguel out of my head.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.841
They spend all this time together
working out, fixing your car.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.635
Yes, but Miguel spending
all that time over there

07:07.718 --> 07:09.971
has given us a chance
to spend more time together.

07:10.054 --> 07:12.181
Did you know LaRusso
showed Miguel <i>Top Gun</i>?

07:12.265 --> 07:14.225
Oof, I love that movie.

07:14.308 --> 07:15.768
Tom Cruise is so handsome.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.395
Cruise is the worst in that.

07:17.478 --> 07:21.023
Here you got the real deal, Iceman,
best of the best, abs for days.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.610
In comes this new guy,
total dweeb, calls himself a maverick.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.446
You can't call <i>yourself </i>a maverick.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.613
Mm. No.

07:28.197 --> 07:32.326
Guy didn't even earn a spot at Miramar.
Got his wingman killed too. Not cool.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.622
Okay.
This is not about Tom Cruise.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.083
This is about Miguel.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.504
-Maybe it's time we tell him about us.
-I don't know.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.882
I feel guilty sneaking around.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.509
It's not good to carry secrets like this.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.386
They wear you down.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.889
What if it just makes things worse?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.766
Miggy loves you.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.352
How could it make things worse?

08:00.730 --> 08:02.690
Kids can be weird
about that kind of stuff.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.733
How about this?

08:04.442 --> 08:07.153
You can tell him,
Johnny, when you're ready.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.656
But I know it will make you feel better.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.296
Never thought I'd know so much about
alternators and power-steering pumps.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.216
I'm sorry you had to give up a Saturday
to work on a car.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.969
Oh, uh, it's okay.
I mean, my mom will be happy.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.138
She can go out on dates again.

08:35.056 --> 08:39.393
-Maybe we shouldn't have fixed it.
-Ah, yeah, I can relate to that.

08:40.019 --> 08:43.022
My mom used to call it
"lunch with a friend." I hated that.

08:43.689 --> 08:47.401
One time, I caught her on a date
with Mr. Harris, my history teacher.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.280
-That was, um… Talk about awkward.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.866
But he gave me an A, though,
so there's an upside.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.285
All right, this looks good.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.120
Now,

08:59.580 --> 09:00.915
it's the moment of truth.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.668
-Get in, give it a try.
-All right.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.462
Let's see.

09:07.463 --> 09:08.965
-Just start it up?
-Start it up.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.927
-Oh, success!
-Look at that! You're a natural.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.642
Now, we gotta get to a party
and meet Amanda and Sam.

09:19.725 --> 09:23.521
-I'm running late. Let's go.
-What? I don't know how to drive a car.

09:24.188 --> 09:27.900
Oh, well, then I suggest
you back us out nice and slow.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.236
Okay.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.494
All right.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.624
-No, you're doing great.
-Okay.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.584
Doing great.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.044
-Oh, nope.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.260
Did I really have to come?

09:54.343 --> 09:57.305
Uh, Sheila's worked for us for ten years.
She's practically family.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.725
Anyway, you used to love
to babysit Cindee. Oh, hi!

10:00.808 --> 10:05.146
This is just about the last place
I'd like to be spending my Saturday.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.189
A lot of people
have it worse than you.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.278
Relax!

10:13.738 --> 10:15.990
Let's go, ladies. Time is money.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.908
They're not gonna wait all day.

10:17.992 --> 10:21.454
By all means, take their tips,
but be discreet about it.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.373
Tammy, come on. More red lip.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.042
It's Tory.

10:26.125 --> 10:29.629
Well, whatever. Just hurry up.
Let's go, ladies! It's show time!

10:57.782 --> 11:00.326
Did I say the last place
I want to spend my Saturday?

11:01.118 --> 11:02.453
I meant the first.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.376
Are you guys gonna beat up this Hawk dude?

11:08.459 --> 11:10.503
Don't worry about it.
Focus on your combos.

11:10.586 --> 11:11.837
Really use that speed. Let's go.

11:13.005 --> 11:13.923
Yep. Again.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.467
Told you I've been practicing.
Got all the moves down.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.554
Oh really?

11:21.222 --> 11:22.056
What?

11:28.312 --> 11:29.355
Come on.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.819
Over at Miyagi-Do,
I was taught you can learn all the moves,

11:34.902 --> 11:36.821
but none of that matters
unless you have balance.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.115
-Understood?
-Yeah.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.914
It's… It's a Cobra Kai lesson.
I was just using a Miyagi-Do--

11:46.997 --> 11:47.915
It's okay.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.042
Balance is crucial.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.378
A man can't stand,

11:54.213 --> 11:55.214
he can't fight.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.510
Give Mr. Keene and me a moment alone.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.178
Yes, sensei.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.684
Sensei Kreese told me all about you.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.645
You trained at Miyagi-Do, now Cobra Kai.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.398
You'll have enough skills
to kick all our asses.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.985
-I'll do whatever it takes to win.
-Good.

12:16.902 --> 12:17.862
Show me.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.742
What's the matter?
You afraid to hit an old man?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.702
Come on. Show me.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.625
Did I say take it easy?

12:32.626 --> 12:34.378
Come on. No mercy.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.472
Good. Good.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.518
Now it's my turn.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.272
-Ha!

12:54.231 --> 12:55.316
Hands up.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.111
Ais!

13:00.321 --> 13:02.364
Ais! Ais! Ais!

13:08.829 --> 13:09.997
Come on.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.460
You've learned to channel your anger,

13:15.461 --> 13:16.629
but you're afraid.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.966
-I'm not afraid of anything.
-You lying to me or yourself?

13:22.384 --> 13:23.844
If you wanna be a champion,

13:24.428 --> 13:27.932
you need to dig out that fear
and face it, whatever it is.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.894
Because if you don't,
it's gonna hold you back forever.

13:33.854 --> 13:34.730
Understood?

13:37.691 --> 13:38.609
Yes, sensei.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.028
Good.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.706
Yeah!

13:55.334 --> 13:56.544
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

14:08.722 --> 14:11.350
<i>Click here</i>
<i>to see videos of the hottest…</i>

14:11.433 --> 14:13.978
-Oh shit. What's that?
-…<i>doing everything.</i>

14:23.362 --> 14:25.114
<i>"You'll never get past me."</i>

14:25.197 --> 14:27.783
"Yes, I will. I'm an American hero."

14:27.867 --> 14:28.701
Bang!

14:29.702 --> 14:31.328
"That's what you get."

14:31.412 --> 14:33.497
<i>"The good guy always wins."</i>

14:35.624 --> 14:37.877
Sweetie,
what are you doing up?

14:38.460 --> 14:41.046
I called Mrs. Wilson,
she says she tucked you in.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.006
I couldn't sleep.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.634
Well… it's good you're up.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.263
'Cause I got some big news.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.974
Do you remember that man Sid
we went out to dinner with?

14:52.057 --> 14:53.183
The fat, bald guy?

14:53.267 --> 14:56.312
Don't say that.
He's a very accomplished man.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.771
Guess what?

14:59.481 --> 15:00.357
He proposed!

15:00.941 --> 15:02.067
Isn't it beautiful?

15:02.651 --> 15:06.238
-This means you're gonna have a new daddy.
-But I don't want a new daddy!

15:06.322 --> 15:10.034
Trust me, sweetie.
Things are gonna be better.

15:10.117 --> 15:10.951
No!

15:21.754 --> 15:22.963
Johnny, please.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.883
What do you have there?

15:31.305 --> 15:32.890
You saved his things?

15:32.973 --> 15:35.517
Johnny, you shouldn't hide this from me.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.353
We have to move on.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.147
I'm throwing it all away.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.273
No!

15:41.357 --> 15:43.734
-Johnny! Enough!

15:44.735 --> 15:45.819
He left us!

15:45.903 --> 15:48.489
You have a new daddy now. Now go to bed!

15:49.907 --> 15:50.741
Now!

16:18.477 --> 16:20.187
This is pretty smooth. Who is this?

16:20.270 --> 16:22.231
Oh, that's Christopher Cross.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.816
He was huge in the '80s.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.776
Sensei didn't tell me about him.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.570
Yeah, well, not everything
from the '80s was hard rock.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.366
There were some soft rock songs
that were just perfect.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.786
Michael McDonald, Billy Joel, Chicago…

16:35.869 --> 16:37.079
Who's Chicago?

16:37.746 --> 16:40.791
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
It's a yellow light.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.546
When you see a yellow light
you're supposed to slow down.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.717
Uh, sorry.
Usually with Sensei Lawrence we kind of--

16:49.800 --> 16:51.260
It doesn't matter what he does.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.887
If you're driving with my daughter,
you take the extra precautions.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.848
Uh, yes. You're right. Uh, I'm sorry.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.683
I was pretty shaky at first too.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.479
Most of the kids my age
had their dads teach them.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.314
But for me,

17:05.607 --> 17:07.359
well, lucky I met Mr. Miyagi.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.529
He made me realize
that just because I didn't have a dad

17:10.612 --> 17:13.323
didn't mean there wasn't
someone who could fill that role.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.410
The sad part is I have a dad.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.037
You ever see him?

17:18.120 --> 17:19.580
I don't know much about him.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.084
He got caught up with something illegal.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.922
My mom was pregnant
and tried to get him to stop and

17:29.965 --> 17:31.050
he wouldn't.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.552
That's why Mom and Yaya moved up here.

17:34.053 --> 17:34.887
I looked him up.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.139
It says he lives in Mexico now.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.643
I haven't told my mom though.
She gets mad whenever I bring him up.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.774
Miguel, I hated my mom
for moving us to LA.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.610
I thought
she was only thinking for herself.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.488
But, as I got older,

17:52.571 --> 17:53.530
I realized

17:55.032 --> 17:56.450
she was doing it all for me.

17:57.451 --> 18:01.830
She wasn't just looking for a new career.
She was looking for a better life.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.750
Sounds like that's what your mom did.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.712
It may not seem brave,

18:08.796 --> 18:13.634
but sometimes avoiding conflict is one
of the most heroic things a person can do.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.104
The prince did everything
to climb the mountain,

18:25.187 --> 18:27.981
but the dragon carried me there
so he could eat me alive.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.359
But then the valiant prince
came to my rescue.

18:30.442 --> 18:33.153
Is that the prince
that you stole from another princess?

18:34.029 --> 18:36.698
The other princess
wasn't dating that prince anymore.

18:38.659 --> 18:43.038
Anyway, uh, the dragon breathed hot fire
at the prince, melting his sword.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.833
So now I had to save the prince.

18:45.916 --> 18:46.792
Using what?

18:46.875 --> 18:47.793
A weapon like,

18:48.377 --> 18:51.255
I don't know,
a spiked bracelet or nunchucks?

18:52.339 --> 18:55.676
No, by singing a magic song.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.469
Oh, and how did the song go?

18:57.553 --> 18:58.929
Yeah, sing us the song!

18:59.012 --> 19:00.931
Yeah! Song!

19:16.196 --> 19:18.991
Wow. And I thought
you were bad at fighting.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.043
But the story doesn't end there.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.547
You see, the song
didn't put the dragon to sleep.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.924
Instead, it turned it into an evil witch.

19:36.008 --> 19:40.053
And that witch has been spotted
at kids' parties all over the Valley.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.599
And the only way she can be destroyed
is with a glitter bomb.

19:49.605 --> 19:53.400
And look! There she is now,
trying to blend in with the crowd!

19:53.483 --> 19:55.027
Die, evil witch!

20:14.713 --> 20:16.048
Not manly enough.

20:26.016 --> 20:26.850
Hey, Robby.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.478
What's going on? You wanna come in?

20:29.561 --> 20:32.189
Hawk and some of your students
have been bullying this kid.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.150
Tell them to stop or there'll be payback.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.528
Payback. What the hell
is Kreese putting you up to?

20:38.612 --> 20:41.365
He's not putting me up to anything.
I'm trying to help this kid.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.368
If those assholes don't knock it off,
I'll do what I have to.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.996
Don't do anything stupid.
You already got kicked out of school.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.748
Miguel attacked me.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.292
I was trying to stop the fight.
He escalated it.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.795
Look, I wasn't there. All right?

20:54.878 --> 20:56.380
But I do know about Cobra Kai.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.508
Kreese is brainwashing you,
just like he brainwashed me.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.263
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.891
You put all your trust in Kreese.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.560
I don't trust anyone anymore.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.105
I'm just using Cobra Kai
to get what I want.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.690
Yeah, I'm sure you think that,

21:14.773 --> 21:16.817
but you're playing with poison.

21:17.442 --> 21:20.028
-You don't know the whole story.
-I know enough.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.613
And I know what's been holding me back.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.157
For as long as I can remember,
I've been afraid.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.702
Afraid that I would end up like you.

21:28.829 --> 21:32.416
But I'm not gonna have that fear again,
because I'm better than you.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.923
There's nothing left to talk about.

21:40.007 --> 21:43.468
So unless there's something else,
I have dinner to make.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.312
You did a nice job behind the wheel.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.939
I say after the party,
we have a little cake, hit the DMV.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.524
-Pick up your license.
-Okay.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.943
-Hey, honey. Sorry I'm late.
-Oh. Mm-hm.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.488
Interesting, uh, choice.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.033
-You going for the, uh, disco ball look?

22:15.292 --> 22:17.461
Hey. No breaks.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.008
Tory, wait.

22:24.551 --> 22:25.761
What do you want?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.180
I'm sorry about Sam.

22:28.263 --> 22:29.514
Yeah, tell that to her.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.724
I will.

22:30.807 --> 22:35.020
But you can't fault her for having
issues with you after what you did.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.859
Look, I know the situation
with your mom is tough--

22:40.942 --> 22:44.363
No. No, you don't know!
So why don't you just stay out of it?!

22:44.446 --> 22:46.281
Okay. Okay, I will.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.199
Just…

22:48.950 --> 22:51.203
Just know that the world
isn't out to get you.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.748
There's gotta be someone
in your family who can help.

22:55.791 --> 22:56.958
No one I can trust.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.087
But it doesn't matter,
I can handle my own shit.

23:01.046 --> 23:01.880
Fine.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.468
No one can help you if you don't let them.

23:07.052 --> 23:07.886
If you ask,

23:08.387 --> 23:09.596
you might be surprised.

23:47.968 --> 23:48.802
Hey, Miguel!

23:49.928 --> 23:53.849
Come over for a bite?
Something I've been wanting to talk about.

23:53.932 --> 23:57.811
Uh, yeah, sure. I just had an early dinner
with the LaRussos though.

23:58.645 --> 23:59.479
Oh.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.523
Yeah. We went
to this place called Katsuya.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.358
Mr. LaRusso's friends with the chef,

24:03.442 --> 24:06.820
so he brought out all this fresh fish.
It was so good.

24:06.903 --> 24:08.196
Uh, but I'm stuffed.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.866
I have to get ready.
I have this thing with Sam later, so…

24:12.075 --> 24:14.995
It seems you've been spending
a lot of time with LaRusso lately.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.038
Yeah, I guess. I mean,

24:17.747 --> 24:20.459
he paid for my mom's car,
showed me how to fix an engine.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.878
-Today he taught me how to drive!
-He did what?

24:22.961 --> 24:25.505
I drove down Ventura with him.
It was so great.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.340
How come you haven't told me
about Chicago?

24:27.424 --> 24:28.633
What happened in Chicago?

24:28.717 --> 24:30.635
No. The band.

24:31.136 --> 24:35.390
You know, uh, "You're the Inspiration,"
"Glory of Love." Peter Cetera's badass.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.602
Peter Cetera is the opposite of badass.

24:39.102 --> 24:42.355
What happened to Scorpions? Slaughter?
Just out the window?

24:42.439 --> 24:45.609
No. Uh, they're cool too.
It's just different, is all.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.027
Yeah, very different.

24:47.110 --> 24:50.113
Okay. Look,
what did you want to talk about?

24:52.282 --> 24:54.451
Oh, nothing. Do your thing.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.244
Okay.

24:59.206 --> 25:03.502
But, hey, look, let's do dinner tomorrow.
You can make those Manwiches?

25:04.377 --> 25:05.504
Oh, yeah, sure.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.421
Okay.

25:09.799 --> 25:11.301
<i>-Hi-yah!</i>

25:20.018 --> 25:21.895
Hey, I'm feeling this movie, man.

25:21.978 --> 25:24.356
This Jean-Claude Van… Damn!

25:24.439 --> 25:25.815
Right in the nuts!

25:28.527 --> 25:30.111
Ha! Oh, man!

25:31.196 --> 25:32.155
Not into the movie?

25:34.032 --> 25:34.991
Oh, it's fine.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.911
I just had a shitty day.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.789
I'd ask, but it's none of my business.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.461
-Here's your stuff.
-Hey, yo, bitch boy.

25:49.673 --> 25:52.551
-What about mine?
-You said you didn't want anything.

25:52.634 --> 25:56.304
I want some now. Get me
two buckets of popcorn with butter,

25:56.388 --> 26:00.850
four large Cokes, two hot dogs
with mustard, no ketchup, and a pretzel.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.018
But I can't carry--

26:02.102 --> 26:05.438
And some nachos with extra cheese
and jalapeño poppers, all right?

26:07.857 --> 26:08.692
Hurry up, man.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.405
Hey.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.867
Don't worry about him.
Hazing the new guy. It's a good thing.

26:17.951 --> 26:18.827
It is?

26:19.411 --> 26:22.289
Yes. Trust me, it's a lot less dangerous
than what I had to do.

26:22.372 --> 26:25.792
Just keep your head up,
you'll earn respect. Got it?

26:27.502 --> 26:28.420
And, um,

26:29.879 --> 26:31.006
get me a Butterfinger.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.308
So Lexi
wants me to send pictures now.

26:41.391 --> 26:44.686
-Dude, I think you're being catfished.
-That's a risk I'm willing to take.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.229
Not these guys again.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.108
-Damn.
-I'm sorry!

26:50.191 --> 26:51.026
That sucks!

26:53.028 --> 26:54.863
That piece of shit.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.161
You should watch where you're going, kid.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.371
Yeah, same goes for you.

27:09.544 --> 27:10.462
Look who it is.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.632
You betrayed Miyagi-Do. Traitor.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.675
Oh, there's a traitor here for sure.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.637
He's gonna get what he deserves.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.096
I don't think so.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.933
Not if I have anything
to say about it, Princess.

27:27.937 --> 27:31.775
Hey, guys. Can you believe
that they have Mr. Pibb and Dr. Pepper?

27:34.194 --> 27:35.570
Oh shit.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.530
Not another rumble.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.867
Careful, LaRusso. Your mommy
isn't here to play peacemaker.

27:40.950 --> 27:43.620
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Stop. We can't do this.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.623
-We'll beat 'em on the mat.
-Oh really?

27:46.706 --> 27:48.917
You remember what happened
the last time we fought, right?

27:50.752 --> 27:54.047
Okay. Meet us
at the baseball diamond in 30 minutes.

27:55.423 --> 27:56.383
And no weapons.

27:56.466 --> 27:57.717
Yeah, we won't need 'em.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.636
Yeah.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.139
Let's go.

28:16.152 --> 28:18.154
-You guys see anything?
-They'll be here.

28:18.780 --> 28:19.989
They'd better be.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.036
Whoa!

28:28.790 --> 28:31.668
Dude, genius move!
We didn't even have to throw a punch!

28:31.751 --> 28:33.461
My favorite kind of victory.

28:36.297 --> 28:37.966
We can't let them get away with this!

28:39.300 --> 28:40.135
We won't.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.681
<i>We gotta hit 'em back</i>
<i>with a home invasion.</i>

28:44.764 --> 28:47.225
-They hit us with a sprinkler?
-This is total bullshit.

28:47.308 --> 28:51.020
-Just shut up and let--
-Now you see what we're dealing with.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.609
As long as LaRusso
and Lawrence are together,

28:57.527 --> 28:59.696
our students have a target on their backs.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.491
We have to strike back.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.409
No.

29:08.246 --> 29:09.664
I agreed to come back

29:10.540 --> 29:12.584
to do what we originally set out to do.

29:13.334 --> 29:14.961
To turn kids into winners.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.590
To bring Cobra Kai back
to its former glory.

29:19.466 --> 29:22.969
But if we're gonna do that,
we have to learn from our mistakes.

29:23.052 --> 29:23.970
What mistakes?

29:24.053 --> 29:29.392
You had the entire Valley
in the palm of your hand and you blew it.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.645
All because of the rivalry
you had with Miyagi.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.647
He attacked my students.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.649
You weren't there.

29:36.733 --> 29:40.612
I'll never forget that morning
when Johnny Lawrence, my champion,

29:40.695 --> 29:44.073
he came into the dojo with a black eye.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.742
<i>And his confidence?</i>

29:45.825 --> 29:46.785
Shattered.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.370
<i>I wasn't gonna let that old man</i>
<i>get away with that.</i>

29:50.330 --> 29:51.331
I understand.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.124
But now,

29:54.626 --> 29:55.710
we're the old men.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.213
And we should use
the wisdom we've learned.

29:58.880 --> 30:02.467
Cobra Kai, it was never about revenge.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.261
It was about building strength

30:05.845 --> 30:08.807
by taking your fears
and turning them into a weapon.

30:09.432 --> 30:10.975
That's what we should be focused on.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.436
If we're just gonna rehash the past,

30:13.520 --> 30:16.022
history will just repeat itself
all over again.

30:18.983 --> 30:22.445
So you're saying,
after they humiliated our students,

30:23.154 --> 30:26.741
we just stand down and do… nothing?

30:26.825 --> 30:28.993
I didn't say we'd do nothing.

30:32.747 --> 30:36.417
Henceforth, Miguel Diaz
shall be known as The Rainmaker.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.628
<i>El Diablo de la Lluvia!</i>

30:39.254 --> 30:41.798
If they hadn't fallen for it,
we would've beaten them.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.967
Maybe, but it could've gone bad.

30:44.050 --> 30:45.593
What could've gone bad?

30:45.677 --> 30:48.054
We were about to get in a gnarly fight
at the drive-in,

30:48.137 --> 30:49.347
but Miguel saved the day.

30:50.473 --> 30:51.558
Oh yeah? How'd you do that?

30:51.641 --> 30:53.685
Told the Cobra Kais
to come to the baseball diamond.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.812
Just in time for the grass to get watered.

30:57.272 --> 31:01.359
So you picked a fight, you didn't show up,
and then you doused them with a hose?

31:02.026 --> 31:03.486
Oh, it was sprinklers.

31:05.029 --> 31:06.489
I'll go back to saying nothing.

31:08.032 --> 31:11.286
You just poked the bear.
What do you think's gonna happen?

31:11.369 --> 31:13.079
They're just gonna
leave well enough alone?

31:13.162 --> 31:17.125
From everything I heard, it sounds to me
like Miguel practiced restraint.

31:17.625 --> 31:20.420
Found a way to get out of a bad situation
without anyone getting hurt.

31:20.503 --> 31:23.590
What did you want him to do,
get in a drive-in switchblade fight?

31:23.673 --> 31:26.467
I'm proud of you.
You've taken Miyagi-Do teachings to heart.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.764
Okay, LaRusso, we need to have a talk.

31:34.726 --> 31:35.560
What the…

31:37.770 --> 31:40.148
<i>Wake up</i>
<i>and smell the coffee, Mr. LaRusso.</i>

31:40.231 --> 31:43.610
You're getting in that ring.
This guy wants to break you!

31:44.319 --> 31:45.862
-Ow!
-Humiliate you!

31:45.945 --> 31:48.281
-Hi-yah!
-Stomp you into the ground!

31:48.364 --> 31:50.575
From now on,
when people say karate around here,

31:50.658 --> 31:52.702
what they'll mean is Cobra Kai karate!

31:52.785 --> 31:54.245
John Kreese's karate!

31:56.122 --> 31:56.998
Gentlemen.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.586
It seems we have a few things to discuss.
