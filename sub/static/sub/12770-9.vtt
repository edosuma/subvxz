WITH THE LUPUS FOUR YEARS AGO,

04:22.458 --> 04:23.417
AND THAT COULD EXPLAIN

04:23.458 --> 04:24.959
THE ABDOMINAL PAIN
AND THE FEVER,

04:25.000 --> 04:26.917
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME
MORE TESTS JUST TO MAKE SURE.

GIVE YOU THE SPEECH,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.333
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW
THIS STUFF INTELLECTUALLY,

05:17.375 --> 05:19.709
YOU NEED TO PROCESS IT
EMOTIONALLY.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.041

09:37.750 --> 09:40.000
YOU'RE NOT BRINGING A TRIPOD
OR A BOOM MIC?

09:42.041 --> 09:43.000
(laughs)

09:43.041 --> 09:44.000
OH.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.208
BOOM MIC.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.291
OH, COOPER.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.291
HOLD ON.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.500
OH, COOPER. COOPER,
I'M JUST KIDDING. OH.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.041
(sighs deeply)

09:54.083 --> 09:56.041
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T
GET PREGNANT THE FIRST TIME.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.959
I KNOW. YOU HAVE TOLD ME
MANY TIMES.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.250
AND I'M GONNA KEEP
TELLING YOU THAT

10:00.291 --> 10:01.458
UNTIL YOU LOOK A LITTLE LESS--

10:01.500 --> 10:03.208
LESS WHAT? (inhales sharply)

10:03.250 --> 10:06.041
MISERABLE? DESPERATE?
(sighs)

10:06.083 --> 10:07.333
I WAS GONNA SAY WISTFUL.

10:07.375 --> 10:09.041
OH.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.250
GOD.

10:10.291 --> 10:13.417
YEAH, I AM.
I AM... WISTFUL.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.041
NO NEED FOR THAT.

10:15.083 --> 10:16.667
EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO TRY AGAIN YOURSELF,

10:16.709 --> 10:18.291
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO MAKE A FAMILY.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.041
HELL, MAYBE YOU'LL GET LUCKY,

10:20.083 --> 10:22.041
FIND OUT SAM KNOCKED
SOMEONE UP TEN YEARS AGO.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.583
(laughs)

10:23.625 --> 10:25.583
I'M GETTING USED
TO THE LITTLE RUG RAT.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.709
MM.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.000
YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

10:28.041 --> 10:29.500
WELL, IT WASN'T EXACTLY
HOW I PLANNED IT.

10:29.542 --> 10:31.458
WELL, WHEN IS LIFE EVER?

10:31.500 --> 10:33.458
THE POINT IS,

10:33.500 --> 10:36.000
YOU HAVE CHOICES.

10:36.041 --> 10:38.417
NOT ALL OF US
CAN SAY THAT.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.291
SO YOU THINK YOU'LL DO IT?

10:41.333 --> 10:42.917
I MEAN, TRY AGAIN?

10:42.959 --> 10:44.333
I DON'T KNOW.

10:44.375 --> 10:45.542
YEAH. I THINK I AM--

10:45.583 --> 10:47.083
I AM.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.667
YOU KNOW, SAM...

10:48.709 --> 10:50.750
HAD THIS LOOK OF RELIEF

10:50.792 --> 10:52.750
WHEN IT DIDN'T TAKE
THE FIRST TIME.

10:52.792 --> 10:54.750
PETE LOOKS RELIEVED
EVERY TIME I LEAVE THE HOUSE.

10:54.792 --> 10:56.208
DOESN'T STOP ME
FROM COMING HOME.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.041
(laughs) WOW.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.041
THAT IS DARK.

11:01.083 --> 11:04.041
ARE YOU AWARE
OF HOW DARK THAT SOUNDS?

11:04.083 --> 11:06.333
FOR SOME REASON, I'M VAGUELY
COMFORTABLE WITH THE DARK.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.291
OKAY.

11:08.333 --> 11:11.041
I'LL HOLD YOUR HAND.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.625
IF YOU WANT TO DO IT,
AND SAM DOESN'T WANT TO,

11:13.667 --> 11:15.834
I WILL.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.917
THANK YOU.
(laughs)

11:19.959 --> 11:21.417
(whirring)

11:21.458 --> 11:23.917
(panting)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:23.959 --> 11:26.792
LIMITED LOSS OF WALL FUNCTION.
CARDIAC OUTPUT IS GREAT.

11:26.834 --> 11:28.041
I'M LIKING WHAT I'M SEEING,
PETE.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.208
YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.000
WELL, YOUR B.P.'s NORMAL,

11:31.041 --> 11:32.375
NO DYSRHYTHMIAS,

11:32.417 --> 11:34.750
YOUR COGNITIVE SKILLS
POST BYPASS--COMPLETELY INTACT.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.333
YOU ARE BACK, PETE.

11:36.375 --> 11:39.041
BACK TO COUNTING THE TEN YEARS
I HAVE LEFT. GREAT.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.333
OH, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU'RE AT.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.333
I MEAN, THERE ARE TONS OF
BYPASS PATIENTS THAT LIVE 20,

11:43.375 --> 11:45.000
25 YEARS PAST SURGERY.

11:45.041 --> 11:47.000
AND WITH THESE NUMBERS, I DON'T
SEE WHY YOU CAN'T EITHER.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.041
SAVE IT, SAM. I'M A DOCTOR.
I'VE READ THE LITERATURE.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.208
OKAY, BUT AS A CARDIOLOGIST,
I'M TELLING YOU,

11:51.250 --> 11:53.208
DON'T GO PICKING OUT
HEADSTONES.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.208
ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE GOT A SECOND
CHANCE TO LIVE A LONG LIFE.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.875
LIVE IT. ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE LUCKY.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.458
(inhales and exhales deeply)

11:59.500 --> 12:00.542
THANKS.

12:00.583 --> 12:02.041
ALL RIGHT.

12:02.083 --> 12:04.417
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

12:04.458 --> 12:05.625
HOW BAD IS IT?

12:05.667 --> 12:06.875
HE'S A LOT WORSE OFF
THAN LAST WEEK.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.458
HIS TEMPERATURE KEEPS SPIKING,

12:08.500 --> 12:10.083
AND HE'S SHOWING SIGNS
OF LIVER FAILURE.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.500
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:11.542 --> 12:13.000
UM...

12:13.041 --> 12:15.000
I DID A BLOOD COUNT,
I DID A LIVER BIOPSY,

12:15.041 --> 12:17.291
AND, UM...
THE LUPUS HAS TRIGGERED

12:17.333 --> 12:22.375
A DISEASE CALLED HEMOPHAGOCYTIC
LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS.

12:22.417 --> 12:24.208
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:24.250 --> 12:27.041
IT MEANS THAT HIS IMMUNE CELLS
ARE ATTACKING HIS OWN BODY.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.917
IT'S VERY AGGRESSIVE. HE'S
GONNA NEED A ROUND OF CHEMO,

12:28.959 --> 12:30.917
HE'S GONNA NEED
A STEM CELL TRANSPLANT,

12:30.959 --> 12:32.875
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO STAY IN
THE HOSPITAL FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.625
A STEM CELL TRANSPLANT?
YEAH.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.667
IT'S VERY SERIOUS,
AND HE COULD DIE.

12:36.709 --> 12:39.750
WE NEED TO FIND A STEM CELL
MATCH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.291
THIS--THIS IS, UH...

12:41.333 --> 12:42.750
WELL, OKAY, IF IT'S
AN INSURANCE QUESTION,

12:42.792 --> 12:44.458
I'VE ALREADY
CONTACTED MEDICAID.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.625
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, JIM,

12:45.667 --> 12:47.500
YOU NEED TO FIND THIS KID
A FOSTER FAMILY.

12:47.542 --> 12:48.750
HE CAN'T
GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.291
WE'VE GONE OVER THIS, COOPER.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.083
LOOK, I-I KNOW.
OKAY, HE NEEDS SOMEBODY.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.458
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN,
OKAY?

12:53.500 --> 12:54.417
(sighs)

12:54.458 --> 12:56.959
I'LL BE HERE
WHENEVER I CAN.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.500
(exhales deeply)

12:58.542 --> 13:00.959
I NEED YOU TO SIGN
SOME CONSENT FORMS.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.917
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:09.291 --> 13:11.792
(both speaking indistinctly)

13:13.583 --> 13:14.792
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:14.834 --> 13:16.041
(sighs)

13:16.083 --> 13:18.458
UH... I'M JUST SPYING
ON MY WOMAN

13:18.500 --> 13:19.458
AND YOUR WIFE.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.709
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

13:20.750 --> 13:22.375
WELL, IF I HAD TO GUESS,
I WOULD SAY THAT ADDISON

13:22.417 --> 13:24.542
IS TALKING ABOUT DOING
ANOTHER ROUND OF I.V.F.

13:24.583 --> 13:27.000
WHILE VIOLET IS...

13:27.041 --> 13:29.041
(chuckles) I'M SORRY, MAN,

13:29.083 --> 13:31.375
BUT YOU ARE SCREWED.

13:31.417 --> 13:33.041
WHAT? WHY?

13:33.083 --> 13:36.375
(chuckles) VIOLET DOESN'T
DO ANYTHING HALFWAY GENERALLY.

13:36.417 --> 13:38.375
AND BOTH OF US ARE LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING TO DISTRACT US

13:38.417 --> 13:40.667
FROM THE VAST MORASS
OF EMPTINESS

13:40.709 --> 13:43.375
OUR MARRIAGE HAS BECOME,
SO...

13:43.417 --> 13:45.208
MY MAN...

13:45.250 --> 13:47.542
DO YOU KNOW HOW DARK
YOU SOUND RIGHT NOW?

13:47.583 --> 13:50.291
(sighs) LOOK, MY POINT IS,
FILLING ADDISON'S UTERUS

13:50.333 --> 13:52.542
IS GONNA BECOME LIKE
AN EXTREME SPORT WITH VIOLET.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.041
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.041
(Violet) WELL, EVERYTHING
YOU SAID MAKES TOTAL SENSE.

13:57.083 --> 13:58.625
SO YOU THINK--

13:58.667 --> 14:01.208
YES. I THINK YOU SOUND FOCUSED
AND POSITIVE AND ENERGIZED,

14:01.250 --> 14:03.500
AND THAT MEANS, FOR YOU, YOU'RE
MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.208
OKAY.

14:06.291 --> 14:07.583
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO WITH YOU?

14:07.625 --> 14:09.333
NO, NO, I-I'LL BE OKAY.
THANK YOU...

14:09.375 --> 14:10.333
OKAY.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.750
FOR OFFERING.

14:13.458 --> 14:14.709
HEY.
HEY.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.083
SO YOU'RE, UH--

14:16.125 --> 14:17.750
ON MY WAY TO SEE JAKE.
RIGHT.

14:17.792 --> 14:19.041
(inhales deeply)

14:19.083 --> 14:20.750
OKAY.

14:20.792 --> 14:22.041
OKAY.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.583
L-ARGININE INCREASES
BLOOD FLOW TO THE UTERUS,

14:28.625 --> 14:30.542
FOLIC ACID, WHICH IS OBVIOUS,

14:30.583 --> 14:31.542
PABA, WHICH IS
A B-COMPLEX VITAMIN--

14:31.583 --> 14:33.792
I-I-I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.750
I'M NO STRANGER
TO VITAMIN THERAPIES.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.041
BUT YOU DON'T THINK,
IN CONJUNCTION WITH METFORMIN--

14:37.083 --> 14:39.041
WE USE METFORMIN FOR
POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME.

14:39.083 --> 14:42.041
YES, BUT IT CAN ALSO HELP
WITH INSULIN RESISTANCE.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.041
WHICH THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
YOU HAVE.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.750
OKAY, BUT VITAMIN THERAPY,

14:45.792 --> 14:46.667
PLUS METFORMIN,

14:46.709 --> 14:48.792
PLUS H.G.H. SHOTS--

14:48.834 --> 14:51.000
EQUALS CRAZY.
(sighs)

14:51.041 --> 14:53.041
LOOK, ADDISON, YOU DON'T NEED TO
BE DOING ALL OF THIS, ALL RIGHT?

14:53.083 --> 14:54.250
AT LEAST NOT YET.

14:54.291 --> 14:55.709
YOU HAVE--YOU HAVE
TWO FROZEN EMBRYOS LEFT.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.291
NO, I WANT FRESH EGGS,
FRESH SPERM.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.041
I'M TAKING ONE LAST SHOT
AT THIS, JAKE,

14:59.083 --> 15:00.917
AND I WANT
THE BEST POSSIBLE ODDS.

15:00.959 --> 15:02.041
YOU WANT
THE BEST POSSIBLE ODDS?

15:02.083 --> 15:03.083
YES!

15:03.125 --> 15:04.083
RELAX.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.333
I AM RELAXED!

15:07.500 --> 15:10.000
(blows air)

15:15.750 --> 15:16.792
(groans)

15:16.834 --> 15:17.834
(knocks on door)

15:17.875 --> 15:19.208
(both speak indistinctly)

15:19.250 --> 15:20.208
OH.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.041
AH!
OKAY. SORRY.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.208
SORRY.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.458
OW!
DONE.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.750
WHY DOES THIS PART
NEVER GET EASIER?

15:26.792 --> 15:28.959
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP OR--

15:29.000 --> 15:30.500
WE'RE AT THE END
OF THE SECOND WEEK, SAM.

15:30.542 --> 15:31.959
YOU WANT TO HELP NOW?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.250
NO, I KNOW THAT YOU

15:33.291 --> 15:35.041
AND ADDISON
ARE DOING THIS TOGETHER.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.041
WELL, 'CAUSE YOU DON'T
WANT TO, RIGHT?

15:37.083 --> 15:39.709
NO. I MEAN, YOU DON'T
WANT TO SEE

15:39.750 --> 15:41.333
OR HEAR OR TALK ABOUT

15:41.375 --> 15:43.458
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN HER LIFE RIGHT NOW--
VIOLET.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.875
WHY ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

15:45.917 --> 15:47.875
BECAUSE I THINK WHEN YOU'RE
IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP,

15:47.917 --> 15:50.041
PUTTING YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND
IS COMPLETE AND UTTER BULL--

15:50.083 --> 15:51.542
VIOLET.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.250
SAM WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE NICE.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.750
RIGHT. (sighs)

15:55.792 --> 15:57.041
I'M SORRY.

15:57.083 --> 16:00.792
I WAS PROJECTING MY OWN MARRIAGE
ON TO YOUR LOVE LIFE.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.041
SO, UH, YOU AND PETE...

16:03.083 --> 16:05.917
WE SUCK. WE JUST--
WE FLAT-OUT SUCK.

16:05.959 --> 16:09.041
AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT
HOW WE GOT HERE, I WISH...

16:09.083 --> 16:11.041
WELL, I MEAN, I WISH
A LOT OF THINGS,

16:11.083 --> 16:13.041
BUT MOSTLY I WISH

16:13.083 --> 16:16.583
THAT WE HADN'T LET IT
GET TO THIS PLACE,

16:16.625 --> 16:18.166
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, Y--

16:18.208 --> 16:20.166
YOU'RE ANGRY
AND THEN YOU'RE RESENTFUL,

16:20.208 --> 16:22.166
AND THEN THINGS START TO CHANGE
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU,

16:22.208 --> 16:24.875
AND THEN BEFORE YOU REALIZE IT,
YOU ARE SO FAR

16:24.917 --> 16:27.041
FROM THE COUPLE
THAT YOU USED TO BE,

16:27.083 --> 16:30.750
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO GET
BACK THERE, OR IF YOU CAN.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.959
AND THAT'S JUST...

16:33.000 --> 16:34.166
YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.959
VIOLET, HAVE YOU AND PETE

16:36.000 --> 16:37.917
EVER TRIED
GOING TO COUPLES THERAPY?

16:37.959 --> 16:39.959
UH, NO, NO,
BECAUSE THAT WOULD REQUIRE

16:40.000 --> 16:42.375
ACTUALLY SPEAKING
TO ONE ANOTHER.

16:42.417 --> 16:44.792
(Hailey) I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.500
I LIKE IT HERE.

16:46.542 --> 16:48.792
WHY CAN'T MY PARENTS
BE RICH DOCTORS

16:48.834 --> 16:50.792
SO I CAN STAY HERE LONGER?
(chuckles)

16:50.834 --> 16:52.542
OR WHY CAN'T I HAVE
BETTER INSURANCE?

16:52.583 --> 16:54.041
IT'S SAFE HERE.

16:54.083 --> 16:55.917
(Amelia) BUT IT'S NOT REAL.

16:55.959 --> 16:57.375
I MEAN, STAYING SOBER HERE

16:57.417 --> 16:58.834
IS LIKE... (inhales deeply)

16:58.875 --> 17:00.667
FEELING HAPPY AT DISNEYLAND.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.583
IT'S EASY. (exhales)

17:02.625 --> 17:05.041
YOU GOTTA GO OUT THERE TO SEE
WHAT YOU REALLY GOT HERE.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.542
YOU KNOW, FOR A GIRL
WITH ALL THE ANSWERS,

17:06.583 --> 17:08.834
YOU'RE AWFULLY QUIET
ABOUT YOUR OWN CRAP.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.750
WOW.

17:10.792 --> 17:11.750
OKAY.

17:11.792 --> 17:14.583
YOU WANT TO BE MAD?
FINE. BE MAD.

17:14.625 --> 17:15.792
I'M NOT MAD.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.875
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU DO
AN AWFUL LOT OF PREACHING

17:17.917 --> 17:19.041
AND NOT MUCH SHARING.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.834
YOU KNOW, JUST 'CAUSE
YOU'RE A DOCTOR

17:20.875 --> 17:22.792
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF US.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.542
OKAY.

17:26.583 --> 17:27.750
WHATEVER.

17:27.792 --> 17:30.041
I THINK HAILEY HAS
A POINT, AMELIA.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.166
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
OPENING UP MUCH.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.667
I OPEN UP.

17:33.709 --> 17:35.000
(woman) NOT TO US.

17:35.041 --> 17:36.792
YOU ALWAYS HAVE AN OPINION
ABOUT OUR STUFF.

17:36.834 --> 17:38.458
WOW. WHAT IS THIS,
A GROUP PILE ON?

17:38.500 --> 17:40.458
(Hailey)
YOU DIDN'T KILL RYAN.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.834
EXCUSE ME?

17:41.875 --> 17:42.875
YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM.

17:42.917 --> 17:43.875
YOU MIGHT HAVE WROTE
THE PRESCRIPTIONS,

17:43.917 --> 17:44.875
BUT HE TOOK THE DRUGS
HIMSELF.

17:44.917 --> 17:46.041
SHUT UP, HAILEY.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.667
AND THAT GUILT?
THAT'S GONNA KILL YOU.

17:47.709 --> 17:49.083
THAT'S WHAT KILLED
MY BEST FRIEND. IT WAS GUILT.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.250
BECAUSE HER MOM WAS SO FREAKED,
SHE HAD A BREAKDOWN

17:50.291 --> 17:52.041
AND HER DAD LEFT...
HAILEY.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.875
SO SHE WAS...
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:53.917 --> 17:56.000
YOU'RE A CHILD,
AND YOU NEED TO SHUT UP.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.000
AMELIA--

17:57.041 --> 17:58.041
YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.041
OKAY?
HE TOOK THE DRUGS HIMSELF.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.792
YOU DIDN'T MAKE HIM TAKE THEM.
HE TOOK THEM HIMSELF.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.041
YOU GOTTA GET THAT.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.250
BEFORE I LEAVE HERE,
YOU HAVE TO GET THAT,

18:06.291 --> 18:08.166
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

18:08.208 --> 18:10.458
AND I NEED YOU TO MAKE IT.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.041
I KNOW YOU LOVED HIM.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.041
AND I KNOW HE LOVED YOU.

18:14.083 --> 18:18.834
BUT HE TOOK
THE DRUGS HIMSELF.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.667

18:21.709 --> 18:23.041
(hits table)

18:23.083 --> 18:26.041
(continues sobbing)

18:29.000 --> 18:30.875
OKAY.

18:30.917 --> 18:33.959
(continues sobbing)

18:34.000 --> 18:35.333

WE CAN TALK AROUND IT,

20:14.041 --> 20:15.041

"WE'LL DEAL WITH IT

THAT I'M IN, AND SAM'S OUT.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.041
WELL, YOU TOOK THE FIRST STEP
BY BRINGING HIM HERE.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.625
SAM, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS?

20:25.667 --> 20:27.083
UH, WELL...

20:27.125 --> 20:30.625
HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK
THIS IS USEFUL...

20:30.667 --> 20:32.041
FOR ME, AT LEAST.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.625
I DON'T WANT A BABY,
AND I DON'T KNOW,

20:34.667 --> 20:37.250
I'VE--I'VE NEVER BEEN
ANYTHING BUT HONEST ABOUT THAT.

20:37.291 --> 20:39.041
SO--

20:39.083 --> 20:40.375
SO WHAT?

20:40.417 --> 20:42.250
SO THIS ISN'T MY PROBLEM.

20:42.291 --> 20:44.583
IT'S--NO, MY PROBLEM
IS THAT I FEEL LIKE

20:44.625 --> 20:46.583
YOU WANT TO HAVE A BABY
SO BADLY

20:46.625 --> 20:49.208
THAT YOU'RE WILLING
TO RISK ANYTHING FOR IT--

20:49.250 --> 20:52.041
YOUR HEALTH, UH, YOUR SANITY,

20:52.083 --> 20:53.458

OKAY, IF IT HAD BEEN...

20:53.500 --> 20:54.458
LET--LET ME--

20:54.500 --> 20:55.792
EASIER TO--
IF IT HAD BEEN EASIER,

20:55.834 --> 20:57.625
IF I HAD GOTTEN PREGNANT
IMMEDIATELY,

20:57.667 --> 20:58.875
WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN BETTER?

20:58.917 --> 20:59.875
(sighs deeply) IF...

20:59.917 --> 21:01.125
NO, BUT--
RIGHT.

21:01.166 --> 21:02.959
WAIT. NO.
LISTEN TO ME.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.125
I LOVE YOU.

21:04.166 --> 21:07.041
I LOVE YOU. I SUPPORT YOU.
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.041
I WANT US
TO HAVE A LIFE TOGETHER.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.875
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO
IS GIVE UP BECAUSE OF A PROBLEM

21:11.917 --> 21:13.083
THAT WE DON'T EVEN HAVE YET.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.917
YEAH, BUT WE ARE
GOING TO HAVE IT, SAM, SOON.

21:14.959 --> 21:16.250
THERE IS GOING TO BE
A BABY,

21:16.291 --> 21:18.041
AND EVEN THOUGH I'M THE ONE
DOING ALL THE FEEDING

21:18.083 --> 21:19.041
AND THE WAKING UP

21:19.083 --> 21:20.250
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THERE
IS TO DO AT THE BEGINNING,

21:20.291 --> 21:22.250
IT DOESN'T END THERE.
IT STARTS THERE.

21:22.291 --> 21:24.208
YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU'RE A PARENT.
I--

21:24.250 --> 21:27.041
YOU HAVE TO WANT TO DO IT.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.458
I DO, MORE THAN ANYTHING.
YOU DON'T.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.041
SO I-I DON'T KNOW
HOW IT COULD WORK.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.792
I DON'T KNOW
HOW WE COULD WORK.

21:32.834 --> 21:33.917
WELL, I WANT YOU.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.083
SO LONG AS I DON'T HAVE
A BABY.

21:35.125 --> 21:37.875
WELL, I WANT YOU, ADDISON.

21:37.917 --> 21:39.041

21:44.834 --> 21:47.041

21:50.333 --> 21:53.000
I'M GLAD YOU WERE WILLING
TO SEE ME.

21:55.083 --> 21:56.375
WHY DON'T YOU HATE ME?

21:56.417 --> 21:58.250
(inhales deeply)

21:58.291 --> 22:01.500
AFTER THE THINGS I SAID,
YOU SHOULD HATE ME.

22:01.542 --> 22:03.041
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HATE YOU.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.792
I-I...

22:04.834 --> 22:07.000
I COULDN'T IF I TRIED,
SO...

22:09.959 --> 22:12.166
WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE?

22:12.208 --> 22:14.291
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.166
I MEAN, I BUILT THIS LIFE

22:16.208 --> 22:18.166
WITH ALL OF YOU,
WITH THE PRACTICE,

22:18.208 --> 22:20.333
AND THEN I BURNED IT DOWN.

22:22.834 --> 22:25.083
SO WHEN I HAVE TO LEAVE
THIS PLACE, I...

22:25.125 --> 22:27.125
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I GO FROM HERE.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.041
I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO TRY TO MAKE AMENDS,

22:32.083 --> 22:33.417
BUT I'M NOT THERE.
I'M NOT READY.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.041
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO FACE EVERYONE.

22:35.083 --> 22:39.125
AND, I MEAN, HONESTLY, SHELDON,
I CAN BARELY EVEN LOOK AT YOU.

22:39.166 --> 22:42.417
THERE'S A SIGN
IN BACK OF YOU.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.125
THAT SEEMS
AS GOOD AN ANSWER

22:44.166 --> 22:46.041
AS ANY I COULD COME UP WITH.

22:51.208 --> 22:52.375
(footsteps approach)

22:52.417 --> 22:53.375
HEY, CHARLOTTE.

22:53.417 --> 22:55.250
DO YOU HAVE PATIENTS
THIS AFTERNOON?

22:55.291 --> 22:56.875
NO. WHY?

22:56.917 --> 22:58.166
I NEED YOU TO GO
TO MASON'S SCHOOL

22:58.208 --> 22:59.792
AND SAVE ME A SEAT
AT HIS PLAY

22:59.834 --> 23:01.083
IN--IN THE FRONT ROW.

23:01.125 --> 23:03.041
SORRY, COOP.
CAN'T DO IT.

23:03.083 --> 23:05.208
WELL, YOU HAVE TO. I JUST
GOT PAGED TO THE HOSPITAL.

23:05.250 --> 23:08.041
COOP, I ATE PIZZA WITH MASON.
I PLAYED VIDEO GAMES WITH HIM.

23:08.083 --> 23:10.125
I EVEN HELPED THE KID WITH
HIS LONG DIVISION HOMEWORK,

23:10.166 --> 23:13.083
BUT I DRAW THE LINE
AT SITTING IN THE FRONT ROW

23:13.125 --> 23:14.667
OF "JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH"

23:14.709 --> 23:16.041
WITH A CHILD
THAT'S NOT EVEN MINE.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.041
I WILL MEET YOU THERE.
I PROMISE.

23:18.083 --> 23:19.458
WHY CAN'T ERICA
SAVE YOU A SEAT?

23:19.500 --> 23:21.083
BECAUSE SHE'S WORKING
BACKSTAGE WITH THE KIDS

23:21.125 --> 23:22.917
ON THE COSTUMES.
I'M BEGGING YOU.

23:22.959 --> 23:25.166
MY SON. FIRST PLAY EVER.

23:25.208 --> 23:26.917
FINE.

23:26.959 --> 23:28.166
BUT YOU OWE ME.

23:28.208 --> 23:29.709
(kisses)
BIG-TIME.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.041
(Cooper) YEAH.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.041
HEY.

23:36.083 --> 23:38.041
YOU LOOK LIKE 10 MILES
OF BAD ROAD.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.000
CHARLOTTE.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.583
YOU DO LOOK A LITTLE PEAKED.

23:44.625 --> 23:45.792
YOU OKAY?

23:45.834 --> 23:48.333
I'M FINE.
I JUST SKIPPED BREAKFAST.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.041
HI. DID YOU SEE AMELIA?
HOW'S SHE DOING?

23:50.083 --> 23:51.959
SHE'S MAKING
SOME REAL PROGRESS.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.959
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
(Addison) IT IS,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.750
ESPECIALLY SINCE SOME PEOPLE
DON'T RESPOND WELL TO THERAPY.

23:56.792 --> 23:59.083
(Sheldon) WELL, I HOPE ALL OF
YOU DO, BECAUSE EVENTUALLY,

23:59.125 --> 24:01.583
SHE'S GONNA NEED US TO JOIN HER
FOR A GROUP THERAPY SESSION.

24:01.625 --> 24:04.333
SHE NEEDS TO MAKE AMENDS
AND...

24:04.375 --> 24:06.291
ADDISON!
ADDISON!

24:06.333 --> 24:07.750
(Violet) OH, MY GOD.
ADDISON, WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:07.792 --> 24:09.834
ALL RIGHT. DON'T MOVE.
GET JAKE, SHELDON.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.500
YEAH, YEAH. I'LL...
GET JAKE.

24:11.542 --> 24:13.208
(sighs)
(Toby) NO, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS!

24:13.250 --> 24:14.500
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:14.542 --> 24:16.041
(woman) I NEED TO SEDATE HIM
BEFORE WE CAN

24:16.083 --> 24:17.750
PUT IN THE CENTRAL LINE
FOR THE STEM CELL INFUSION.

24:17.792 --> 24:19.291
TOBY HATES NEEDLES.
(groaning)

24:19.333 --> 24:21.709
TOBY, DID DR. BERMAN EXPLAIN
TO YOU WHAT SHE WAS DOING?

24:21.750 --> 24:23.125
YES, BUT I'M SCARED

24:23.166 --> 24:25.875
IF SHE PUTS ME TO SLEEP,
I'LL NEVER WAKE UP.

24:25.917 --> 24:27.667
I-I HAD THE SAME FEELING WHEN
I HAD MY APPENDIX TAKEN OUT.

24:27.709 --> 24:29.166
OKAY? I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE.

24:29.208 --> 24:31.041
MAN, I WAS--
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

24:31.083 --> 24:32.250
HEY, WHO SAID
YOU WERE GONNA DIE?

24:32.291 --> 24:33.250
YOU DID.

24:33.291 --> 24:35.500
I HEARD YOU TELL JIM.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.792
NO, I DID--

24:36.834 --> 24:38.917
TOBY,
I'M SORRY YOU HEARD THAT,

24:38.959 --> 24:41.041
BUT YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU ARE NOT GONNA DIE.

24:41.083 --> 24:45.250
JIM WAS ASKING ME ABOUT
SOME RISKS AND--AND...

24:45.291 --> 24:47.041
YOU ARE NOT GONNA DIE.

24:47.083 --> 24:49.041
(sighs)

24:49.083 --> 24:51.333
WILL YOU STAY WITH ME?

24:51.375 --> 24:53.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:53.083 --> 24:55.709
WELL, I-I COULD. I KNOW,
UH, JIM WANTS TO STAY.

24:55.750 --> 24:58.750
HE HAS A MILLION OTHER KIDS
TO TAKE CARE OF.

24:58.792 --> 25:01.000
(inhales deeply)

25:01.041 --> 25:02.041
UM...

25:02.083 --> 25:03.375
MAYBE WE'LL BOTH STAY?

25:06.083 --> 25:10.166
ARE WE READY
TO DO THIS NOW?

25:10.208 --> 25:11.959
YEAH. OKAY? WE'RE READY?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.792
YEAH, WE'RE READY.

25:13.834 --> 25:17.750
(beeping continues)

25:20.333 --> 25:23.083
SAM, WHAT HAPPENED?
I HEARD ADDISON COLLAPSED.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.166
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S SOME KIND OF
A SIDE EFFECT WITH THE HORMONES.

25:25.208 --> 25:27.000
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE IN THERE?

25:27.041 --> 25:28.417
NO. THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR ME IN THERE.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.208
SHE DOESN'T WANT ME
IN THERE.

25:30.250 --> 25:32.125
VIOLET'S...
IN THERE WITH HER.

25:32.166 --> 25:34.750
THIS IS LIKE HER--
HER PROJECT.

25:34.792 --> 25:37.208
IS SHE PLANNING ON RAISING
THE BABY WITH ADDISON, TOO?

25:37.250 --> 25:39.041
THAT'D MAKE MY LIFE A LOT
EASIER. I'LL JUST TAKE LUCAS...

25:39.083 --> 25:40.542
(sighs)
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, MAN.

25:40.583 --> 25:42.458
DARK HUMOR'S ALL I GOT.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.041
NO, IT'S NOT.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.041
YOU GOT A KID
THAT YOU LOVE,

25:46.083 --> 25:48.875
YOU GOT A WIFE
THAT YOU LOVE.

25:53.917 --> 25:55.875
YOU TOLD ME
I HAD ANOTHER 25 YEARS,

25:55.917 --> 25:58.041
AND THE FIRST THING
I THOUGHT WAS,

25:58.083 --> 26:00.917
I MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ABLE
TO DANCE AT MY SON'S WEDDING.

26:00.959 --> 26:02.834
IT MADE ME HAPPY.

26:02.875 --> 26:04.834
AND THEN I THOUGHT...

26:04.875 --> 26:09.291
THAT MEANS I HAVE
ANOTHER 25 YEARS WITH VIOLET.

26:12.291 --> 26:15.250
I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT THAT.

26:15.291 --> 26:18.041
(sighs)

26:18.083 --> 26:20.250
I'M SORRY, MAN.

26:20.291 --> 26:22.166
(inhales deeply)

26:22.208 --> 26:24.458
I WON'T LEAVE.

26:26.083 --> 26:28.500
I DON'T HAVE IT IN ME
TO LEAVE.

26:33.667 --> 26:37.291
(indistinct conversations)

26:37.333 --> 26:39.333
HEY.

26:39.375 --> 26:41.333
HEY. HEY, BUDDY.

26:41.375 --> 26:43.208
HOW'D IT GO?

26:43.250 --> 26:45.500
HE WAS TERRIFIC.
MISSED HIS DAD, THOUGH.

26:45.542 --> 26:46.500
WE ALL DID.

26:46.542 --> 26:49.542
MASON, I AM...
REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.458
YOU PROMISED
YOU'D BE THERE...

26:51.500 --> 26:52.458
IN THE FRONT ROW.

26:52.500 --> 26:53.959
I KNOW.
SOMETHING HAPPENED AT WORK--

26:54.000 --> 26:55.709
I FORGOT
MY LINE TO THE SEAGULL

26:55.750 --> 26:57.125
'CAUSE I COULDN'T FIND
YOUR FACE.

26:57.166 --> 26:59.709
OH, HONEY, YOU COVERED SO WELL,
NOBODY EVEN NOTICED.

26:59.750 --> 27:03.041
EVERYONE NOTICED.
THEY ALL LAUGHED AT ME.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.083
OH.

27:04.125 --> 27:05.333
OH, BUDDY.

27:05.375 --> 27:07.500
SHOULD WE GO GET
SOME PIZZA?

27:07.542 --> 27:09.375
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE,
COOPER.

27:09.417 --> 27:11.583
OH. (whispers) IT'S OKAY.

27:11.625 --> 27:13.792
I'M SORRY.

27:17.709 --> 27:21.333
SO MY ABDOMEN FILLED
WITH FLUID...

27:21.375 --> 27:23.583
SECONDARY TO
THE FERTILITY TREATMENT?

27:23.625 --> 27:25.333
IT'S RARE, BUT IT--
IT DOES HAPPEN.

27:25.375 --> 27:27.041
YOU CAN STILL IMPLANT,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

27:27.083 --> 27:28.375
WELL, I NEED TO ASPIRATE
THE FLUID.

27:28.417 --> 27:29.875
YOU NEED TO REST
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,

27:29.917 --> 27:32.291
BUT THEN...
IF YOU'RE READY TO GO AGAIN--

27:32.333 --> 27:34.000
I WILL BE.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.166
YOU HAVEN'T GONE IN YET?

27:41.208 --> 27:43.083
OH, NO.
SHE'S STILL TALKING TO JAKE.

27:43.125 --> 27:46.041
HE SAYS, UH,
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE

27:46.083 --> 27:48.041
AND THAT IT WAS
A COMPLICATION.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.417
WELL,
COMPLICATIONS HAPPEN.

27:49.458 --> 27:51.000
YEAH. YEAH.

27:53.792 --> 27:55.333
SO YOU CAN, UH,

27:55.375 --> 27:57.000
YOU CAN TALK TO HER NOW.

27:57.041 --> 27:59.917
I'LL LET HER GET HER REST.
SHE KNOWS I'M HERE.

27:59.959 --> 28:01.041
SAM--

28:01.083 --> 28:03.041
SHE KNOWS I'M HERE.

28:08.792 --> 28:12.208
(man) ADDICTION IMPACTS
ENTIRE FAMILIES.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.709
STRONG FAMILIES
ARE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS

28:13.750 --> 28:16.375
OF SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY PLANS.

28:16.417 --> 28:18.041
IN THIS CASE...

28:18.083 --> 28:21.041
AMELIA HAS NAMED ALL OF YOU

28:21.083 --> 28:22.458
AS HER FAMILY.

28:26.834 --> 28:28.583
I DON'T KNOW...

28:28.625 --> 28:31.875
HOW TO APOLOGIZE.

28:31.917 --> 28:34.417
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

28:36.917 --> 28:40.041
I WANT TO TAKE BACK
EVERYTHING I SAID.

28:40.083 --> 28:42.625
I KNOW I CAN'T.

28:42.667 --> 28:46.417
I WAS SICK
AND I WAS SCARED

28:46.458 --> 28:48.041
AND I DIDN'T MEAN...

28:48.083 --> 28:50.542
(exhales)

28:52.333 --> 28:54.417
I WANTED TO HURT YOU.

28:54.458 --> 28:57.208
I WAS TRYING TO HURT YOU.

28:57.250 --> 28:59.500
AND I THINK I SUCCEEDED.

28:59.542 --> 29:01.000
(exhales)

29:01.041 --> 29:02.667
AND IF I COULD CHANGE THAT,

29:02.709 --> 29:04.667
IF I COULD GO BACK
AND UNSAY--

29:04.709 --> 29:07.208
IF I COULD GO BACK
AND UNDO...

29:07.250 --> 29:09.500
(exhales deeply)

29:09.542 --> 29:11.041
THE DRUGS, UM,

29:11.083 --> 29:13.458
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT
ALCOHOL AND DRUGS,

29:13.500 --> 29:16.500
UH, BRING OUT THE TRUTH.

29:16.542 --> 29:18.500
AND MAYBE THAT'S THE CASE
WITH NORMAL PEOPLE.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.458
I DON'T KNOW.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.041
I WON'T EVER KNOW.

29:22.083 --> 29:24.000
BUT I KNOW THAT WITH ME...

29:25.583 --> 29:28.041
THE DRUGS BRING OUT LIES.

29:28.083 --> 29:29.750
THEY BRING OUT HATE

29:29.792 --> 29:33.208
AND THEY BRING OUR CRUELTY
AND VICIOUSNESS,

29:33.250 --> 29:37.041
AND THOSE THINGS
ARE NOT ME.

29:37.083 --> 29:38.542
THEY'RE NOT THE REAL ME.

29:38.583 --> 29:43.458
THE REAL ME IS THE PERSON THAT
YOU KNEW BEFORE THE DRUGS.

29:43.500 --> 29:47.500
THE REAL ME IS THE PERSON
THAT IS SITTING HERE NOW.

29:47.542 --> 29:50.041
AND I HOPE...

29:50.083 --> 29:52.333
THAT YOU BELIEVE ME...

29:52.375 --> 29:55.125
(voice breaks)
WHEN I SAY HOW SORRY I AM.

29:55.166 --> 29:56.583
(inhales deeply)

29:56.625 --> 29:59.125
(exhales deeply)

29:59.166 --> 30:00.333
BUT EVEN IF
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,

30:00.375 --> 30:03.875
I HAVE TO SAY IT ANYWAY,
BECAUSE...

30:03.917 --> 30:07.083
I WANT TO LIVE.

30:07.125 --> 30:10.709
THE MAN I LOVE DIED,
AND I THINK THAT HE WOULD BE...

30:10.750 --> 30:12.125
(sniffles)

30:12.166 --> 30:14.125
I THINK THAT HE WOULD BE
SO PISSED AT ME IF I DIED, TOO,

30:14.166 --> 30:16.250
SO I'M SAYING I'M SORRY

30:16.291 --> 30:21.000
AND... I'M SAYING THAT
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.

30:21.041 --> 30:24.000
I HOPE I CAN FORGIVE MYSELF.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.583
I CAN'T TAKE IT BACK,

30:29.625 --> 30:31.917
BUT I'M GONNA TRY
TO MOVE FORWARD

30:31.959 --> 30:35.709
AND I'M GOING TO TRY
TO DO BETTER.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.291
(sighs)

30:37.333 --> 30:43.000
I'M GONNA TRY TO NEVER HURT
ANY OF YOU EVER AGAIN.

30:48.083 --> 30:49.417
(knock on door)

30:49.458 --> 30:50.959
(door opens)

30:51.000 --> 30:52.583
HEY.

30:52.625 --> 30:54.041
YOUR MOM SAID YOU WERE
DOING YOUR HOMEWORK.

30:54.083 --> 30:55.542
YOU NEED ANY HELP?

30:55.583 --> 30:57.125
I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

30:57.166 --> 30:58.583
ALL RIGHT.

30:58.625 --> 31:01.625
UH, MAYBE WHEN YOU'RE DONE,
WE CAN GO TO THE BATTING CAGES,

31:01.667 --> 31:03.208
TAKE SOME SWINGS?

31:03.250 --> 31:05.000
THIS MIGHT TAKE A WHILE.

31:05.041 --> 31:07.166
(sighs)

31:07.208 --> 31:09.417
MASON.

31:12.709 --> 31:15.250
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME
BECAUSE I MISSED THE PLAY.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.125
AND I WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU
THAT I'M NEVER GONNA MISS

31:19.166 --> 31:22.166
ANOTHER SCHOOL PLAY
OR A SOCCER GAME, BUT...

31:22.208 --> 31:25.041
I'M A DOCTOR FOR KIDS,
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU.

31:25.083 --> 31:27.041
AND SOMETIMES,
THOSE KIDS NEED ME

31:27.083 --> 31:29.458
WHEN THEY'RE REALLY SICK.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.083
MORE THAN ME?

31:33.083 --> 31:34.458
SOMETIMES.

31:34.500 --> 31:36.041
BUT...

31:36.083 --> 31:38.208
LOOK... (sighs)

31:38.250 --> 31:40.500
I KNOW YOU MUST HAVE
BEEN SCARED

31:40.542 --> 31:42.000
UP THERE ON THAT STAGE,

31:42.041 --> 31:44.041
BUT I KNEW YOU WERE SAFE.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.500
I KNEW YOU WERE OKAY.

31:45.542 --> 31:47.625
BUT I WASN'T SO SURE
ABOUT TOBY.

31:47.667 --> 31:50.709
HE NEEDED A-A PROCEDURE
TO SAVE HIS LIFE,

31:50.750 --> 31:53.500
AND UNLIKE YOU, WHO'S GOT YOUR
MOM AND ME AND YOUR FRIENDS,

31:53.542 --> 31:56.625
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYBODY.

31:56.667 --> 32:00.000
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

32:02.083 --> 32:03.500
ALL RIGHT.

32:03.542 --> 32:05.291
I'LL LET YOU DO YOUR WORK.

32:05.333 --> 32:07.542
I LOVE YOU. (kisses)

32:10.000 --> 32:11.458
(Violet) PETE AND I,

32:11.500 --> 32:12.917
IT'S JUST, WE...

32:12.959 --> 32:15.291
WE JUST COEXIST.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.208
AND INTELLECTUALLY,
I GET IT.

32:17.250 --> 32:19.417
THERE ARE STAGES
TO PETE'S RECOVERY

32:19.458 --> 32:21.291
THAT--THAT MIRROR
THE STAGES OF GRIEF,

32:21.333 --> 32:24.208
AND THAT CAN BE VERY HARD
FOR A COUPLE TO GET THROUGH.

32:24.250 --> 32:28.417
I HAVE WALKED MANY PATIENTS
THROUGH THIS EXACT SAME THING,

32:28.458 --> 32:31.208
AND I'VE SEEN IT SHRED COUPLES,
SHRED FAMILIES.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.208
(inhales)

32:32.250 --> 32:33.458
BUT?

32:33.500 --> 32:35.458
BUT I'VE ALSO SEEN IT
GO THE OTHER WAY.

32:35.500 --> 32:38.083
I-I'VE SEEN GRIEF
BRING FAMILIES TOGETHER.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.959
THAT'S THE STAGE THAT I'M
WAITING FOR... (chuckles)

32:41.000 --> 32:44.041
THE STAGE WHERE WE SAY,
"OH, MY GOD THAT WAS HARD,

32:44.083 --> 32:48.333
BUT--BUT WE'RE BETTER OFF
FOR IT," YOU KNOW?

32:48.375 --> 32:51.959
OR WE LOVE EACH OTHER
SO MUCH MORE BECAUSE WE STUCK.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.709
THAT'S WHAT I'M WAITING FOR.

32:53.750 --> 32:55.041
(sighs)

32:55.083 --> 32:57.041
BUT I DON'T SEE ANY SIGN THAT

32:57.083 --> 32:59.750
THAT'S WHAT HE'S HOPING FOR
OR WORKING TOWARD.

32:59.792 --> 33:02.750
IT'S JUST...

33:02.792 --> 33:04.250
OH, MY GOD.

33:04.291 --> 33:06.709
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

33:06.750 --> 33:08.000
WHAT?

33:08.041 --> 33:10.125
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO IT.

33:10.166 --> 33:11.583
THE EMBRYO TRANSFER--

33:11.625 --> 33:13.667
I DON'T--I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TRY AGAIN.

33:13.709 --> 33:14.667
I'M GONNA GO.

33:14.709 --> 33:15.625
WAIT. ARE YOU OKAY?

33:15.667 --> 33:17.959
YES, YES. I JUST NEED
TO TALK TO PETE.

33:20.667 --> 33:21.834
HEAR ME OUT.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.083
UM... (clears throat)

33:24.125 --> 33:26.083
LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,

33:26.125 --> 33:28.792
UH, IT REALLY--
IT REALLY SCARED ME.

33:28.834 --> 33:30.333
AND I KNOW THAT--THAT--
THAT THERE WAS A COMPLICATION

33:30.375 --> 33:31.750
OR--OR WHATEVER,

33:31.792 --> 33:34.083
BUT IT REALLY--IT--
I WAS REALLY SCARED.

33:34.125 --> 33:37.041
SO FOR YOU TO TRY
TO DO IT AGAIN,

33:37.083 --> 33:39.542
I...

33:39.583 --> 33:41.166
I LOVE YOU.

33:41.208 --> 33:42.625
ALL RIGHT?
AND I'M ASKING YOU, PLEASE--

33:42.667 --> 33:45.041
I ALREADY DID IT.

33:45.083 --> 33:47.792
THIS MORNING, JAKE TRANSFERRED
TWO OF MY FROZEN EMBRYOS.

33:47.834 --> 33:50.333
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU
TONIGHT.

33:50.375 --> 33:52.667
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

33:52.709 --> 33:54.041
SAM, THIS IS IT.

33:54.083 --> 33:56.041
OKAY? NO MORE HORMONES,
NO MORE I.V.F.,

33:56.083 --> 33:58.041
NO MORE SPERM DONORS.

33:58.083 --> 34:01.583
I'M EITHER PREGNANT
OR I'M NOT.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.041
OKAY.

34:08.083 --> 34:09.458
(inhales)

34:09.500 --> 34:12.709
(exhales)

34:13.667 --> 34:16.041
I DON'T WANT TO BE ANNA.

34:16.083 --> 34:17.041
WHAT?

34:17.083 --> 34:18.792
YOUR WIFE. YOUR FIRST WIFE.

34:18.834 --> 34:20.667
YOU HATED HER, BUT YOU STUCK.

34:20.709 --> 34:22.709
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HATE ME
BUT STICK ANYWAY.

34:22.750 --> 34:24.041
I DON'T--I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO BE ANNA.

34:24.083 --> 34:25.709
AND I KNOW WE TOOK VOWS,

34:25.750 --> 34:27.792
AND I KNOW YOU PRIDE YOURSELF
ON STICKING TO YOUR WORD.

34:27.834 --> 34:30.041
I KNOW YOU'LL STAY, PETE.
YOU'LL STAY NO MATTER WHAT.

34:30.083 --> 34:32.500
BUT... I DON'T WANT THAT.

34:32.542 --> 34:35.792
THAT IS NO LIFE FOR ME
OR FOR LUCAS.

34:35.834 --> 34:37.792
AND--AND I KNOW YOU ARE
MORE COMFORTABLE STICKING

34:37.834 --> 34:39.792
THAN BEING THE GUY
WHO LEAVES,

34:39.834 --> 34:41.917
SO, UM...

34:41.959 --> 34:45.375
SO I'LL--I'LL LEAVE YOU.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.000
IF YOU CAN'T DO IT

34:47.041 --> 34:49.709
BUT THAT'S REALLY
WHAT YOU WANT,

34:49.750 --> 34:51.750
IF YOU DON'T LOVE ME...

34:54.875 --> 34:57.709
IF YOU DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE,

34:57.750 --> 34:59.667
THEN ASK ME TO LEAVE...

34:59.709 --> 35:02.291
AND I WILL.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.625
I'LL DO THAT FOR YOU,

35:04.667 --> 35:06.875
FOR US.

35:06.917 --> 35:08.125
AND WE'LL...

35:10.583 --> 35:13.166
(voice breaks) WE'LL FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE IT OKAY FOR LUCAS.

35:14.750 --> 35:17.333
I DO LOVE YOU.
I STILL LOVE YOU.

35:17.375 --> 35:19.667
BUT I DON'T WANT THIS
FOR US.

35:19.709 --> 35:21.041
SO THINK ABOUT IT.

35:21.083 --> 35:22.917
TAKE A WEEK.
TAKE--TAKE YOUR TIME.

35:22.959 --> 35:26.917
BUT... KNOW THAT I MEAN IT.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.500
I'LL LET YOU OUT.

35:28.542 --> 35:30.792
I'LL BE THE ONE
WHO LEAVES.

35:30.834 --> 35:32.166
OKAY?

35:36.625 --> 35:39.208
CAN YOU NOD IF IT'S OKAY?

35:51.917 --> 35:54.000
OKAY.

36:33.208 --> 36:35.500
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

36:35.542 --> 36:36.875
IT'S NO BOTHER.

36:36.917 --> 36:38.667
MASON WAS HOPING
TO FIND COOPER.

36:38.709 --> 36:40.959
AH, COOPER'S AT THE HOSPITAL
RIGHT NOW.
