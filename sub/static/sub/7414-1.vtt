01:02.056 --> 01:04.375
Hey, I'm great at that game.

01:04.474 --> 01:10.006
Back home in California, I'm, like, deadly.
Hold on, I'll teach you girls how to play.

01:12.192 --> 01:16.429
Hey, come on. We need an extra guy
to even out the sides.

01:16.529 --> 01:18.933
Hey, come on.

01:19.158 --> 01:23.562
All right, now, let me show you how
to do this. Now just watch closely.

01:31.262 --> 01:32.363
Get the bag, please?

01:32.963 --> 01:35.699
How 'bout some help?

01:35.799 --> 01:39.578
- What's his problem?
- I don't know. He just got here yesterday.

01:39.720 --> 01:44.249
Excuse me! Throw me the bag,
then you can go back to sleep, OK?

01:46.603 --> 01:47.796
Bitch.

01:49.147 --> 01:52.133
We like a little teamwork
around here, pal.

01:53.610 --> 01:56.638
You know, loners don't go
too far in this outfit.

01:56.738 --> 01:59.808
- Private!
- The colonel. Shit!

02:02.953 --> 02:08.316
I'll have the house ready for you
in three weeks, Dad, OK? I love you.

02:08.416 --> 02:10.318
Take care.

02:10.418 --> 02:11.861
Bye.

02:15.257 --> 02:17.034
- Hello, Charley.
- Hi, ma'am.

02:17.134 --> 02:18.703
- How are you?
- Just fine.

02:18.844 --> 02:20.955
Stay with the convoy
till you get to town.

02:21.055 --> 02:24.208
- You've lots of time to get to the airport.
- Of course, sir.

02:24.308 --> 02:27.420
Sergeant, you know how
important she is to me.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.839
Yes, sir. She'll be safe with me, sir.

02:29.939 --> 02:32.800
- Are you ready for the trip?
- Yep. Thank you.

02:38.989 --> 02:41.058
All right, move it out.

04:51.919 --> 04:55.322
- What's goin' on here?
- Just pull over to the side.

04:55.422 --> 04:57.533
It'll take a second.

04:57.633 --> 04:59.702
- Good morning.
- Morning.

05:12.649 --> 05:14.050
Freeze.

05:15.193 --> 05:16.970
All right, take it easy.

05:17.070 --> 05:21.141
All we need are the trucks. Tell your men
to surrender. No one will get hurt.

05:21.241 --> 05:23.601
Take it easy. Take it easy.

05:23.827 --> 05:25.270
Let's go!

05:26.579 --> 05:28.815
Move, move. Get out!

05:43.014 --> 05:44.915
Nobody shoot. Nobody shoot.

05:45.307 --> 05:47.376
Hold your fire.

05:48.394 --> 05:53.299
Let 'em take what they want.
There's nothing here worth dyin' for.

05:55.109 --> 05:58.763
Charley, come on. Let's go. Come on,
What are you waiting for? Step on it.

05:58.863 --> 06:00.931
- Hurry up.
- Out!

06:04.326 --> 06:06.437
Don't resist. Don't resist.

06:12.127 --> 06:15.280
Who do you think you are?
You have no business hitting him!

06:15.380 --> 06:18.575
Shut up! Get in the car.

06:36.652 --> 06:38.805
No, let her go! Don't shoot!

06:57.840 --> 06:59.992
Come on! Let's take 'em!

07:47.058 --> 07:49.127
Shit!

07:56.526 --> 07:58.386
Move it!

08:01.739 --> 08:03.809
Go! Get going!

08:14.211 --> 08:16.071
Holy shit!

08:21.885 --> 08:24.121
Go after him! He's getting away!

10:03.574 --> 10:06.227
- Hey, where are you going?
- Get away from me!

10:06.327 --> 10:07.186
Hey!

10:09.247 --> 10:11.607
What do you think you're doing to me?

10:28.267 --> 10:30.127
Stop it!

10:42.239 --> 10:43.265
He!

10:54.876 --> 10:56.737
Kill him!

11:00.741 --> 11:01.993
No!

11:02.135 --> 11:04.203
No more. Enough. We give up!

11:10.727 --> 11:13.379
- Who is he?
- I don't know. He's a new recruit.

11:13.479 --> 11:15.548
I don't even know his name.

11:16.441 --> 11:19.260
He possess great skills.

11:46.972 --> 11:49.458
I can take care of myself. Let go of me.

12:31.644 --> 12:33.712
Who are they?

12:42.071 --> 12:44.849
What do you think I am,
a jungle baby or something?

12:44.949 --> 12:48.978
Would you? I can't go as fast as you.
Don't you touch my shoes.

12:49.078 --> 12:52.481
I hope you're going to Italy
to get me a pair of designer shoes.

12:52.581 --> 12:56.653
I can't believe you just did that.
You are crazy, do you know that?

12:56.753 --> 13:00.866
These are my favorite shoes.
What are you gonna do with that?

13:01.049 --> 13:03.285
What?

13:08.515 --> 13:12.961
You, my dear, are going to town
to buy me new shoes and a new skirt.

13:13.061 --> 13:16.131
Don't you touch my skirt. What are you?

13:35.251 --> 13:38.112
No! No way.
I am not going in that water.

13:38.212 --> 13:42.408
I don't care who's chasing us.
There are leeches. I'm not going in there.

14:11.955 --> 14:13.815
Do!

14:33.561 --> 14:37.590
Get away from me, you creep!
You trying to kill me or something?

14:37.690 --> 14:39.967
Leave me alone, all right?

14:43.279 --> 14:45.348
I swear.

14:50.287 --> 14:54.483
Would you look at me? Look at my shirt.
Look at my hair. It's a mess.

14:55.584 --> 14:58.278
Do you have a comb, by any chance?

14:58.754 --> 15:01.698
Comb. Course not. Stupid question.

15:01.799 --> 15:04.076
- Shoes...
- Are you OK?

15:07.846 --> 15:13.085
- My clothes are just a bit wet, thank you.
- Well, we can hang 'em out to dry.

15:13.227 --> 15:14.253
Are you serious?

15:15.938 --> 15:18.591
They should be dry pretty soon.

15:25.990 --> 15:29.936
If my father saw us out here like this,
he would absolutely kill you.

15:30.036 --> 15:32.105
Do you realize that?

15:32.288 --> 15:34.941
Oops. But... I kinda like it.

15:35.041 --> 15:39.946
- Feels kinda natural, don't you think?
- It's gonna start getting dark.

15:40.088 --> 15:43.783
You know, I don't even know your name.

15:44.551 --> 15:46.578
Joe.

15:46.678 --> 15:48.914
That's it?

15:49.014 --> 15:51.584
- Yeah, just call me Joe.
- Joe.

15:52.935 --> 15:55.838
- OK, Joe.
- Look...

15:57.439 --> 16:02.428
Colonel's gonna be worried. We'd
better get dressed and get outta here.

16:13.664 --> 16:16.358
I want every inch of that
jungle covered before dark.

16:16.459 --> 16:19.404
- Get every man out in the field now.
- Yes, sir.

16:19.754 --> 16:24.242
Third time we've been hit. Call the chief of
police and tell him to get his ass in gear.

16:24.342 --> 16:25.702
Sir!

16:25.802 --> 16:29.497
And your ass is in a sling, mister,
if anything's happened to Patricia.

16:29.639 --> 16:34.127
- We tried our best, sir.
- Obviously it wasn't good enough.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.546
- No, sir.
- What happened out there?

16:36.646 --> 16:39.674
We've never had any casualties
in these instances before.

16:39.774 --> 16:43.136
We wouldn't have had any
if that new man hadn't been along.

16:43.236 --> 16:47.934
Your daughter'd be here right now, safe, if
he hadn't started acting like John Wayne.

16:48.034 --> 16:51.979
That son of a bitch is gonna be sorry
he ever joined this goddamn army.

16:52.121 --> 16:54.190
- Jackson!
- Yes, sir.

16:54.749 --> 16:57.318
- Did you check the wounds?
- Yes, sir. I did.

16:57.418 --> 17:01.364
- What the hell did you find out?
- Have you ever heard of ninjutsu, sir?

17:01.505 --> 17:04.075
- The secret art of assassination.
- Yeah, I have.

17:04.215 --> 17:06.786
Well, according to
witnesses' testimony...

17:06.886 --> 17:09.121
this massacre was the work of ninjas.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.373
Ninjas?

17:10.806 --> 17:15.503
You have served me well, my friend.
Until today, your record was spotless.

17:16.188 --> 17:20.050
But the truck with the most
valuable cargo got away.

17:20.192 --> 17:24.387
Another incident like this, I might
have to shut down the entire operation.

17:29.534 --> 17:32.938
An American ninja? What do you mean?
There is no such thing.

17:33.038 --> 17:38.694
I do not lie. I know it is death to
teach the secrets to the westerner...

17:38.794 --> 17:42.322
but I also know there was
an American ninja there.

17:42.422 --> 17:44.492
The buyers arrive tomorrow.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.288
It's a multimillion-dollar deal.
Nothing must be left to chance.

17:49.389 --> 17:53.251
This American, whatever
he is, get rid of him.

18:22.631 --> 18:24.700
I guess it's goodbye.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.829
Guess so.

18:30.013 --> 18:32.082
Well, bye.

18:33.934 --> 18:35.127
Goodbye.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.260
Look at me.

18:42.402 --> 18:44.804
Don't I look absolutely ridiculous?

18:46.948 --> 18:49.893
- No, you look good.
- Thank you.

18:49.993 --> 18:52.312
Well, goodbye.

19:01.337 --> 19:02.322
Joe!

19:03.715 --> 19:06.367
Thanks. Thanks for everything.

19:11.724 --> 19:15.669
I suppose you think you're a hero cos
you brought my daughter back alive.

19:15.769 --> 19:17.129
No, sir.

19:17.479 --> 19:19.340
Good.

19:19.440 --> 19:23.928
Because I've got half a mind
to throw you under the stockade.

19:24.028 --> 19:27.264
Just what in the hell were you
tryin' to prove out there?

19:27.364 --> 19:29.475
Nothing, sir.

19:29.575 --> 19:32.269
We've got a touchy situation
with these rebels.

19:32.369 --> 19:35.731
We're under standing orders
not to provoke any incidents.

19:35.831 --> 19:39.610
There was nothing in
that convoy <i>worth</i> protecting.

19:39.711 --> 19:42.280
Now we've got four
dead men on our hands.

19:42.380 --> 19:44.532
There's gonna be an investigation.

19:44.633 --> 19:48.745
You're gonna be court-martialled
and I can't help ya.

19:48.845 --> 19:51.164
Get outta my sight.

19:59.022 --> 20:01.508
- Do you have his record, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

20:01.650 --> 20:05.011
- Well, let's hear it.
- Yes, sir.

20:05.111 --> 20:07.847
Date of birth: Unknown.

20:07.948 --> 20:10.601
Parents: Unknown.

20:10.701 --> 20:12.853
Next of kin: Unknown.

20:17.958 --> 20:21.195
A construction crew found him
on an island six years ago...

20:21.295 --> 20:26.992
knocked unconscious by an explosion
to blast a road through the jungle.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.954
Brought back to the United States
with total amnesia.

20:30.054 --> 20:34.959
In and out of foster homes. Hell, he's
got more last names than I could count.

20:35.851 --> 20:38.797
Here it is. I knew it.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.926
Aged 16, in reform school
for almost killing a man.

20:43.026 --> 20:47.305
- That's correct, sir.
- Six months ago he got in trouble again.

20:47.406 --> 20:52.060
Judge gave him a choice:
Enlist or go to jail.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.938
Confine him to base
till we finish the investigation.

20:55.038 --> 20:57.816
- Yes, sir.
- And keep him away from Patricia.

20:57.916 --> 20:58.942
Yes, sir.

21:15.601 --> 21:20.840
All right, men. I know our morale is low,
so now let's just go hit the showers, OK?

21:20.940 --> 21:24.969
That's him, man. There's that
bastard I was telling you about.

22:03.066 --> 22:05.136
Let's go.

22:16.748 --> 22:21.069
Hey, Joe Hero. Did you
make out with the princess?

22:21.252 --> 22:25.114
Did she put out a little bit
to thank you for saving her life?

22:25.256 --> 22:28.534
Let's get outta here. This place stinks.

22:41.106 --> 22:45.052
Four bodies to impress a girl.
Was a heavy price, wasn't it?

22:45.152 --> 22:47.221
Wasn't it?

23:14.599 --> 23:18.128
- <i>Bienvenido.</i>
- <i>Hola, amigo Ortega.</i>

23:18.228 --> 23:20.964
- Welcome to the Ortega estate.
- Thank you very much.

23:21.064 --> 23:25.385
- Welcome. <i>Pasen, por favor.</i>
<i>- No está mal.</i>

23:25.485 --> 23:27.554
- Hi.
- Janette.

23:27.654 --> 23:28.930
- <i>Enchanté.</i>
- Juliette.

23:29.072 --> 23:30.890
Very nice to meet you.

23:31.909 --> 23:36.480
<i>Qué cosas más lindas</i>
<i>tienes aquí en tu palacio.</i>

23:40.251 --> 23:43.571
<i>Pero, es espeluznante</i>
<i>todo esto, ¿verdad?</i>

23:45.297 --> 23:49.660
Everything that you see
here... it all belongs to me.

23:52.930 --> 23:57.793
We are totally autonomous here.
We grow our own food, train our staff...

23:57.893 --> 24:00.922
and store our product
until the right buyers...

24:01.022 --> 24:03.759
such as yourselves, can take delivery.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.927
Very impressive.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.264
This way.

24:19.541 --> 24:25.405
This is Shinyuki. He's responsible for the
beautiful landscape you see around you.

24:25.672 --> 24:29.242
I found him when I bought the estate.
He was hiding in the jungle...

24:29.342 --> 24:34.582
in uniform, a Japanese soldier, who was
unaware for years that the war was over.

24:35.766 --> 24:39.212
He never says a word. Well, hardly ever.

24:39.312 --> 24:43.549
But as you can see,
he is truly an artist.

25:02.306 --> 25:04.488
Very impressive.

25:42.794 --> 25:44.654
This is my private army.

25:44.754 --> 25:48.616
In addition to ensuring safe acquisition
and delivery of the merchandise...

25:48.758 --> 25:54.956
each member of my special duty staff
here is specially trained to...

25:55.056 --> 25:59.295
help you with any problems
you may encounter with the opposition.

26:00.104 --> 26:03.465
The results are quite efficient
and final.

27:12.303 --> 27:18.584
Black Star Ninja is the only top-ranking
ninjutsu sensei outside Japan.

27:19.477 --> 27:25.300
Believe me when I tell you this man
is deeply honored to die at his hands.

27:26.568 --> 27:28.637
This way, please.

27:35.243 --> 27:37.354
You have an excellent inventory.

27:37.454 --> 27:41.024
It's all straight from the factory.
I don't deal in used equipment.

27:41.124 --> 27:43.235
You'll find only the best here.

27:43.335 --> 27:46.863
But items which are most valuable
to us, you still don't have.

27:46.963 --> 27:49.366
Do you think you can
comply with our needs?

27:49.466 --> 27:52.494
I'm expecting the final items
in the next few days.

27:52.594 --> 27:56.457
If we can agree on a price, it can be
included in the next shipment.

27:56.557 --> 27:59.043
<i>Tres miliones, para todo.</i>

27:59.185 --> 28:02.463
There are other buyers also interested.

28:02.563 --> 28:06.050
<i>Bastante completo el equipo.</i>
<i>Podemos pagar cuatro millones.</i>

28:07.568 --> 28:10.429
- Cash on delivery.
- But of course.

28:10.780 --> 28:15.184
It's a pleasure doing business with you,
my friend, and you, pleasure.

28:15.284 --> 28:18.521
- Pleasure.
- And now for some champagne.

28:48.443 --> 28:50.512
Hey!

28:51.698 --> 28:53.766
So you're the new driver?

28:55.576 --> 28:58.604
I hear you think yourself to be
some kind of a tough guy.

28:58.705 --> 29:00.773
A karate boy.

29:01.624 --> 29:07.488
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you, hero.
- He thinks he's a real bad-ass, Jackson.

29:07.588 --> 29:10.491
I think you should
teach him a lesson there, ace.

29:10.591 --> 29:12.535
Bad-ass?

29:12.635 --> 29:17.874
You know, every place you go, there's
someone who thinks he's a bad-ass.

29:17.974 --> 29:21.754
- Then there are those few who are.
- He ain't one of 'em.

29:21.854 --> 29:24.965
Are you some kind of
a bad-ass, karate boy?

29:25.065 --> 29:28.260
Because from what I heard,
you didn't act like one the other day.

29:28.360 --> 29:32.556
And we lost some good
friends because of it?

29:32.656 --> 29:37.644
We like to know where a person stands.
We pride ourselves on teamwork here.

29:37.745 --> 29:40.314
We left all the glory boys
back in Vietnam.

29:40.456 --> 29:45.527
Because glory boys like you get people
killed. You understand what I'm sayin'?

29:47.212 --> 29:50.075
Yeah, you understand what I'm sayin'.

29:56.306 --> 29:58.374
So let's go, bad-ass.

29:59.225 --> 30:02.670
Let's see what kind
of stuff you're made out of.

30:08.568 --> 30:11.638
- Don't push it.
- Good.

30:12.322 --> 30:15.433
Very good. I've touched somethin'.

30:16.576 --> 30:18.687
Let's go.

30:19.747 --> 30:21.816
I'm talkin' to you, Mr. Hero.

30:24.460 --> 30:26.695
OK. All right, let's do it.

30:26.837 --> 30:30.616
Come on, baby. Come on, fight me.
Who the fuck are you? Come here!

30:30.758 --> 30:33.035
Come on, fight me, man.

30:42.144 --> 30:44.213
Whoa!

30:44.313 --> 30:46.006
Shut up!

30:47.024 --> 30:49.094
Hey! Hey!

31:03.375 --> 31:04.818
Hey!

31:06.169 --> 31:09.489
Hey! We don't stop
till one of us goes down.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.908
Now. Let's go.

31:16.012 --> 31:18.916
What are you gonna do
with that hose? Play with yourself?

31:19.016 --> 31:21.085
Show me what you do.

31:41.455 --> 31:43.524
Jackson, get up.

31:50.924 --> 31:53.076
Here. Go and get him with this.

31:53.176 --> 31:56.204
- You damn right I'll get him.
- Yeah! Yeah!

31:59.057 --> 32:01.084
- What's this?
- Mess him up now.

32:01.184 --> 32:04.212
- What is this?
- He can't even see you.

32:18.619 --> 32:20.688
All right, all right, all right.

32:35.136 --> 32:37.163
Hey.

32:37.263 --> 32:39.332
I'm Jackson.

32:40.475 --> 32:42.585
Joe.

32:42.685 --> 32:45.506
Curtis Jackson is man enough
to admit when he's wrong.

32:45.606 --> 32:48.425
- Joe's all right, right?
- Right.

32:48.525 --> 32:52.846
Ain't this a bitch? I've been instructing
martial arts in the army for many years...

32:52.946 --> 32:56.892
and you've got some sharp moves.
Who'd you study with?

32:57.034 --> 33:02.189
Nobody. I just picked up a few things
here and there, in the streets.

33:02.331 --> 33:04.399
In the str...

33:07.211 --> 33:11.156
Well, look, thanks for the demonstration.
That's the lesson for today, guys.

33:11.298 --> 33:15.620
If you can get your opponent off balance,
you use his own energy to defeat him.

33:15.720 --> 33:18.832
- Get your ass in my office.
- But Sarge, he was just...

33:18.932 --> 33:21.334
Don't try to cover up for him, Jackson.

33:21.434 --> 33:24.003
I saw the whole thing. He started it.

33:24.145 --> 33:28.633
- Sarge, you got it wrong.
- Knock it off. He's not worth it.

33:29.359 --> 33:32.679
The guy's trouble. Move it.

33:54.134 --> 33:55.619
Still on the shit list?

33:55.719 --> 33:59.415
Till they decide whether to
court-martial me or not. Go ahead.

33:59.557 --> 34:01.792
Man, that ain't gonna happen.

34:02.184 --> 34:06.422
You know, Charley said six ninjas
went after you and Patricia.

34:06.522 --> 34:09.632
Those guys aren't amateurs,
and neither am I.

34:09.733 --> 34:12.512
Now, level with me.
Where'd you learn those moves?

34:12.612 --> 34:17.016
And don't give me that look. I know it's
not from the streets. I'm from the streets.

34:17.117 --> 34:19.518
I don't know where I learned 'em.

34:19.661 --> 34:23.857
I just know 'em. As far back
as I can remember, I just know 'em.

34:23.956 --> 34:26.775
Come on, gimme a break, will ya?

34:26.877 --> 34:29.779
Look, your moves are too perfect.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.032
Somebody had to teach them to you.

34:41.183 --> 34:43.377
- It's a long story.
- OK.

34:44.770 --> 34:46.839
I lost my memory a few years ago.

34:46.938 --> 34:49.592
My whole childhood is
completely wiped out.

34:49.692 --> 34:53.804
I remember bits of things sometimes,
but they're like dreams.

34:55.281 --> 34:57.516
I can't seem to figure 'em out.

34:58.242 --> 35:02.605
Look, I still think you can make some
good use of those fancy moves of yours.

35:02.705 --> 35:05.816
You know, you and I, man,
we could make a staged exhibition.

35:05.916 --> 35:11.740
You know, like wrestling, in the States?
The crowds go crazy for that kind of stuff.

35:12.716 --> 35:15.118
I don't like crowds.

35:15.218 --> 35:18.330
Look, Joe, read my lips.

35:18.430 --> 35:20.999
We can make some easy money.

35:22.434 --> 35:28.048
Look, Jackson, I don't wanna fight, I don't
like crowds and I don't need money.

35:38.951 --> 35:41.020
Miss, we'd better get going.

35:43.998 --> 35:48.319
There'll be a lot of trouble
if we don't... leave now.

35:49.712 --> 35:51.781
Yeah, you don't need money.

35:52.757 --> 35:54.826
Hey, what do you need?

35:56.219 --> 35:59.705
Glad to see you're still human.
She's cute, isn't she?

36:01.682 --> 36:03.543
- Who?
- Who?

36:03.643 --> 36:07.214
You may have kicked my ass,
but you did not make me blind.

36:07.981 --> 36:12.010
- Jackson, she's the colonel's daughter.
- I know, but nobody's perfect.

36:12.111 --> 36:15.180
But she is cute, isn't she? Isn't she?

36:15.280 --> 36:18.267
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:18.742 --> 36:23.438
You're tinglin'. You're tinglin'.
I knew I've touched something again.

36:23.539 --> 36:25.566
Yeah.

36:25.916 --> 36:29.403
Boy, you sure are lucky goin' back
to California. I wish I was.

36:29.503 --> 36:32.489
You couldn't tell by lookin' at me,
but I'm a famous surfer.

36:32.589 --> 36:36.161
- I love nothin' more than wiping a few...
- Charley, stop the car.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.037
- What's wrong?
- Stop the car.

36:38.138 --> 36:40.290
What is it? Hijackers?
I gotta get you home.

36:40.390 --> 36:44.794
- Listen, you gotta do me a big favor.
- No, I can't. I can smell trouble already.

36:44.894 --> 36:47.714
Charley, there'll be
no trouble if you keep quiet...

36:47.814 --> 36:51.092
and take me back home
right now. I'll explain it all later.

36:55.238 --> 36:57.307
OK.

36:58.783 --> 37:02.312
OK. Hey, listen, you through thinkin'
about those exhibitions yet?

37:02.453 --> 37:07.610
Cos we can make a great team. We could
quit the army. We'd make a fortune.

37:07.751 --> 37:10.946
- Maybe Charley can help you.
- No thanks. Sweating's bad for ya.

37:11.046 --> 37:15.159
It means you're puttin' forth effort.
Jackson, you gotta help me.

37:15.259 --> 37:19.788
I set myself up with a date with this girl,
but the colonel's got me runnin' errands.

37:19.889 --> 37:23.417
In 30 minutes, I'm to meet her
at the country club, and I won't make it.

37:23.559 --> 37:26.462
Could you run a note over there
and tell her I'll be late?

37:26.562 --> 37:31.091
I hate to burst your bubble, but I can't.
I have to report in a few minutes.

37:31.191 --> 37:36.598
Shit. Man, I hate to lose this chick.
Jackson, she thinks I'm intense.

37:37.574 --> 37:40.060
- I'll get her the note.
- No, no, you can't.

37:40.201 --> 37:43.813
- You're confined to the base, man.
- I'll be fast. No one will notice.

37:43.955 --> 37:46.775
- Are you sure?
- Do you want her to get the note?

37:46.875 --> 37:50.320
She'll be on the balcony, wearin'
a white dress. You cannot miss her.

37:50.462 --> 37:53.239
Jackson. I'm gonna need your bike.

37:53.340 --> 37:57.369
Oh, man, that's my baby. That's my
life's blood. You sure you can handle it?

37:57.469 --> 38:01.831
Look, Joe, call me a worrywart,
call me irresponsible...

38:01.931 --> 38:05.878
but how do you plan to get off the base
without the MPs catching you?

38:05.978 --> 38:07.630
Watch.

38:10.191 --> 38:12.677
Watch what, Joe? Joe, Joe...

38:22.662 --> 38:25.064
- Joe?
- What's he gonna do?

38:32.798 --> 38:35.450
Is he gonna do what
I think he's gonna do?

38:51.233 --> 38:55.595
Well, look here, Charley. I wanna
talk to you about your future.

38:55.695 --> 38:56.972
My future?

38:57.072 --> 39:02.603
See, you're gonna put on working fatigues
and be ready to cover up for Joe.

39:02.703 --> 39:07.508
- What's that got to do with my future?
- If you don't do it, you won't have one.

39:08.027 --> 39:09.110
Yeah, OK.

39:41.577 --> 39:43.687
Hi, Joe.

39:44.371 --> 39:46.940
Is this note from Charley for you?

39:47.082 --> 39:49.401
Nope. It's for you.

39:59.053 --> 40:01.831
- This was your idea?
- I had to see you.

40:04.100 --> 40:06.169
Look...

40:07.312 --> 40:09.088
it can never work.

40:09.189 --> 40:12.425
Oh, be quiet.
It's gonna be a wonderful evening.

40:12.525 --> 40:14.677
Come on.

40:14.777 --> 40:16.846
Come on.

40:39.803 --> 40:41.872
Why, thank you, Luis.

40:51.607 --> 40:57.472
Oh, don't worry about it, Joe. You can
order anything. It'll go on Dad's account.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.228
That's him.

41:03.578 --> 41:05.897
That's the one from the convoy.

41:05.997 --> 41:12.112
- I thought you'd taken care of him.
- I did. I had him confined to the barracks.

41:12.212 --> 41:14.781
- I'll place him under arrest...
- One moment.

41:14.923 --> 41:17.117
Let me look at him.

41:19.594 --> 41:21.663
What's the matter?

41:25.684 --> 41:31.215
The sergeant? Oh, don't worry
about him. He's a real pussycat, really.

41:37.405 --> 41:41.600
That's señor Ortega. He owns a big
plantation on the other side of the island.

41:41.701 --> 41:43.853
Dad really likes him.

41:43.994 --> 41:46.772
Arresting this guy is not enough.

41:47.331 --> 41:49.817
- I want him dead.
- Dead?

41:50.668 --> 41:53.320
There's an investigation
goin' on right now.

41:53.421 --> 41:55.991
Could blow the whole thing
wide open. You sure?

41:56.133 --> 41:57.784
Yes.

41:58.593 --> 42:01.747
And already I know
how you are going to do it.

42:16.778 --> 42:18.555
Oh, come on.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.309
Come on!

42:33.171 --> 42:35.740
Like my bike?

42:35.882 --> 42:38.451
Yeah. Yeah.

42:39.760 --> 42:41.829
I had a nice time today.

42:43.014 --> 42:44.790
So did I.

42:47.393 --> 42:49.462
Would you like to come in?

42:50.563 --> 42:53.050
I don't think I should.

42:53.817 --> 42:55.802
I think you should.

43:13.086 --> 43:15.155
Ten hut!

43:19.927 --> 43:21.995
Come on. Get up.

43:32.649 --> 43:38.096
We've got some soldiers in this unit
who think they can make a fool out of me.

43:38.196 --> 43:43.601
They don't know I've been a sergeant
in this man's army before they were born.

43:43.701 --> 43:46.854
Even before they were
sent to reform schools.

43:47.247 --> 43:49.899
I understand you like
to do extra duties, do you?

43:49.999 --> 43:51.902
- No, sir.
- No?

43:52.002 --> 43:55.614
I heard yesterday you volunteered
to do some, didn't ya?

43:55.756 --> 44:00.035
Well, don't worry, Charley.
I won't deny you that privilege.

44:00.135 --> 44:03.288
You could keep doin' 'em
till I said you had enough.

44:03.389 --> 44:06.542
And that's gonna be
a long time from now.

44:07.184 --> 44:09.420
And as for you, hero...

44:10.896 --> 44:13.924
you believe my orders
can be ignored, right?

44:15.109 --> 44:17.177
You don't like the hard work.

44:18.445 --> 44:21.891
You'd rather be
drivin' around town, right?

44:23.118 --> 44:26.021
Well, I'll have you drivin', all right.

44:26.121 --> 44:28.189
Report to the motor pool.

44:48.268 --> 44:52.548
Sergeant Rinaldo told me to report here.
There's an assignment for me.

44:52.648 --> 44:56.844
That one goes over to the warehouse
on the dock. You know where it is?

44:56.944 --> 44:59.346
Thanks, I'll find it.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.281
Hey, this warehouse five?

45:20.552 --> 45:22.871
Where is everyone?

48:39.381 --> 48:39.990
Go!

50:27.285 --> 50:29.354
Come on.

51:26.846 --> 51:28.915
<i>Pasa.</i> Let's go.

51:49.620 --> 51:52.439
It's here. Let's go and see it?

52:29.202 --> 52:31.271
Open it.

52:34.292 --> 52:36.652
<i>Magnifique.</i>

52:40.965 --> 52:42.533
Just beautiful.

52:42.633 --> 52:47.455
Goes on the shipment the morning
after tomorrow with everything else?

53:23.675 --> 53:25.285
Hey, you!

53:27.471 --> 53:28.497
What was that?

53:36.439 --> 53:39.842
Someone is in here. Lock
the door so he can't get away.

53:43.071 --> 53:46.432
Everyone, look around you.
Wait a minute.

53:51.746 --> 53:53.815
The ninja will take care of it.

54:22.986 --> 54:24.429
Hey! Hold it!

54:27.282 --> 54:28.976
Outside.

54:55.520 --> 54:57.589
Two of you, round the back, now!

55:29.264 --> 55:31.833
- Is that the American?
- Yes.

55:32.809 --> 55:34.878
We must stop him.

55:38.565 --> 55:42.177
Come, this way. Come. Hurry.

55:46.072 --> 55:49.392
- Who are you?
- You will know when the time is right.

55:49.743 --> 55:52.562
- Our paths will meet again.
- Whaddaya mean?

55:52.662 --> 55:56.066
Your karma and mine, they are connected.

55:56.917 --> 55:57.777
Go.

56:36.166 --> 56:39.185
Telephone. Get me the sergeant.

56:43.632 --> 56:47.494
- Rinaldo here.
- He escaped the trap. I don't know how.

56:47.928 --> 56:51.289
<i>The ambush was perfect. And</i>
<i>listen to me, Sergeant. He was here.</i>

56:51.390 --> 56:54.543
He's seen the missile.
He knows too much and I want him dead.

56:54.643 --> 56:58.047
I don't care how you do it.
The plan must proceed as programmed.

56:58.147 --> 57:00.466
Don't worry about it, Victor.

57:00.566 --> 57:02.635
He'll be taken care of.

57:16.416 --> 57:19.360
Hold it right there, soldier.
You're under arrest.

57:19.460 --> 57:21.779
I have to see the colonel.
My truck was hijacked.

57:21.879 --> 57:26.785
My order is to place you under arrest.
You can tell your story to the duty officer.

57:26.885 --> 57:28.954
Take him away.

57:44.862 --> 57:48.390
Sir. I'm sorry to bother you, but
I believe a mistake has been made.

57:48.532 --> 57:49.933
What is it, Corporal?

57:50.033 --> 57:54.230
A man was picked up for being AWOL. I
may be able to explain the circumstances.

57:54.330 --> 57:57.150
There's been one arrest today
and it was no mistake.

57:57.250 --> 57:59.903
Unless you want to
question a direct order.

58:00.003 --> 58:02.739
No, I don't. But could you
tell me the charges, sir?

58:02.839 --> 58:06.367
Very serious. It has to do
with stealing military equipment.

58:06.467 --> 58:09.871
- Expensive military equipment.
- Stealing military equipment?

58:09.971 --> 58:13.082
I warned you not to involve
yourself with the man, Corporal.

58:13.182 --> 58:18.630
Hey, you're a good soldier. Why don't ya
keep it that way? Stay out of this?

58:18.730 --> 58:22.343
But Sarge, this just doesn't sound right.
Couldn't his story be true?

58:22.484 --> 58:26.180
- We've lost a lot of trucks recently.
- Yeah, that's true.

58:26.322 --> 58:29.934
But he's always had witnesses before.
This time he was alone.

58:30.075 --> 58:33.270
Now, losing a truck, in itself,
is a heavy-duty violation...

58:33.370 --> 58:35.773
which will result in serious charges.

58:35.915 --> 58:38.776
He might have sold
the shipment to the rebels...

58:38.876 --> 58:41.570
in which case, he's gonna
sit for many years.

58:41.670 --> 58:45.699
- But Sarge, it was a mistake.
- You don't know the man, Jackson.

58:45.799 --> 58:50.454
He has a criminal record.
It's true, a mistake was made here...

58:50.554 --> 58:53.333
and that was enabling him
to enlist in the army.

58:53.433 --> 58:57.295
Forget about him, Corporal.
His fate's in the court's hands now.

58:57.395 --> 58:59.464
Thank you, Sergeant.

59:18.375 --> 59:21.529
Bye, thanks for coming. Nice seeing you.

59:21.629 --> 59:23.698
Bye-bye.

59:24.215 --> 59:26.158
- Patricia.
- Hello. Dad's inside.

59:26.258 --> 59:28.494
Actually, I came to
see you. It's about Joe.

59:28.594 --> 59:31.580
- What about?
- Your father wants to court-martial him.

59:31.681 --> 59:34.625
What? Well, come inside.
We'll talk about it.

59:35.976 --> 59:39.088
Colonel, something just isn't right.
I know Joe, and I know...

59:39.188 --> 59:43.134
That's enough, Corporal. I don't want
to hear any more from either of ya.

59:43.234 --> 59:47.012
The man's been nothing but trouble.
He's gonna be court-martialled...

59:47.154 --> 59:49.933
and I'm gonna make sure
he gets what's coming to him.

59:50.033 --> 59:52.269
You're dismissed, Corporal.

59:52.369 --> 59:53.311
Yes, sir.

59:57.249 --> 01:00:01.361
The American knows too much.
It is too dangerous to let him live.

01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:06.908
- He must be terminated.
- My men failed to kill him in the jungle.

01:00:07.008 --> 01:00:11.204
They made the mistake
of underestimating him. I will not.

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:13.915
Can you do it? Can you kill him?

01:00:15.719 --> 01:00:18.476
- Then do it.
- <i>Hai.</i>

01:00:19.355 --> 01:00:21.424
- Tonight.
- <i>Hai.</i>

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:33.998
Yeah, it's probably a fuse.

01:01:35.308 --> 01:01:37.377
Where is that damn box?

01:01:39.437 --> 01:01:41.923
Hey, Tuck? Tucker?

01:01:47.821 --> 01:01:50.891
Get this damn thing to
work here. Let's see now.

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:15.479
Hold it right there!

01:05:18.622 --> 01:05:20.566
All right. Freeze!

01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:36.040
- What happened to Charlie?
- They got him.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.835
- Over there. He went that way.
- I'll get it.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.421
- Damn. Look at his neck.
- I think he's gone.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:45.300
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, Collins, over here.

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:49.137
- What's up?
- What's all the commotion about?

01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:51.639
- This way.
- Jackson.

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:54.893
Joe, how did you get out of prison?

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:57.061
Never mind. I need your help.

01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:59.481
The ninjas were sent
to kill me in my cell...

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:02.484
All right, wait.
Start from the beginning.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:05.236
The sergeant's got
some big operation going.

01:06:06.714 --> 01:06:08.824
OK, hold it. Pull up, yeah.

01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:14.163
Get the light over here.

01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:20.377
Oh, my God.

01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:25.257
This is crazy. You'll get yourself killed.
Why don't we tell the colonel?

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:29.303
No, they're leaving in the morning.
I gotta catch Ortega before he leaves.

01:06:29.445 --> 01:06:33.724
What I need is a jeep. Meet me behind
the motor pool in a half-hour. You got it?

01:06:33.824 --> 01:06:37.437
- Yeah.
- And Jackson... be careful, huh?

01:06:37.579 --> 01:06:39.856
OK.

01:06:57.265 --> 01:06:59.584
Here he comes.

01:06:59.684 --> 01:07:03.463
- Jackson, what is she doing here?
- You can't go through with it.

01:07:03.605 --> 01:07:05.716
- You'll get killed.
- Gimme the jeep.

01:07:05.816 --> 01:07:09.178
- Will you trust me on this one?
- Joe, please listen to me, please.

01:07:09.278 --> 01:07:12.056
Why don't you talk to my father?
He'll listen to you.

01:07:12.156 --> 01:07:16.477
- I know what I'm doing.
- You gotta trust somebody sometime.

01:07:16.577 --> 01:07:20.147
If I mean anything to you,
please trust me now.

01:07:20.957 --> 01:07:24.652
- I can't.
- We're the only two people you can trust.

01:07:24.752 --> 01:07:26.821
Please, Joe.

01:07:28.256 --> 01:07:31.325
- OK. Let's go.
- All right.

01:07:35.097 --> 01:07:39.042
And you honestly expect me to believe
this cock-and-bull story, Private?

01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:42.170
It's the truth, sir.
The sergeant's working with Ortega.

01:07:42.271 --> 01:07:44.673
And they may be behind the hijackings.

01:07:44.773 --> 01:07:50.178
Colonel, may I suggest that we run up
some men, and go kick some ass... sir.

01:07:52.281 --> 01:07:55.309
I've known both of these men for years.

01:07:55.409 --> 01:07:57.894
The sergeant's my most trusted man.

01:07:58.453 --> 01:08:01.023
We went through the war
together. You know that.

01:08:01.123 --> 01:08:04.360
Dad, can't you check out
Joe's story before it's too late...

01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:07.196
and the missiles get shipped out?

01:08:09.632 --> 01:08:14.203
Tell you what I'll do. To eliminate any
doubt you might have on this matter...

01:08:14.304 --> 01:08:18.374
I'll launch a full-scale
investigation, starting right now.

01:08:18.474 --> 01:08:21.586
We'll find out if this man's
story is true or not.

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:29.969
Hello, this is the colonel. Would you send
a squad of MPs out to my house now?

01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:33.557
What? When?

01:08:34.073 --> 01:08:36.477
Yeah, I hear you.

01:08:36.618 --> 01:08:38.687
Right away.

01:08:42.707 --> 01:08:45.109
Well, the ball's in motion.

01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:48.572
Let's relax and have a cup
of coffee while we're waiting.

01:08:48.671 --> 01:08:50.573
Janette?

01:08:50.674 --> 01:08:53.160
Ooh, I told you so.

01:09:19.703 --> 01:09:21.773
Sergeant, arrest this man.

01:09:21.872 --> 01:09:25.068
Draw up the papers necessary
charging him with manslaughter.

01:09:25.167 --> 01:09:28.446
- What are you doing?
- Get him outta here, and this time...

01:09:28.546 --> 01:09:30.698
make sure he doesn't escape.

01:09:30.841 --> 01:09:33.243
- No, please!
- Stop it, Patricia. Stop it.

01:09:33.385 --> 01:09:37.997
He killed an officer while escaping the
stockade. This man has a criminal record.

01:09:38.098 --> 01:09:41.460
He served time in prison
even before joining the army.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.796
He's no good for you, Patricia.

01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:47.006
Is it true, Joe?

01:09:48.734 --> 01:09:50.386
Take him.

01:09:57.743 --> 01:10:00.480
Get him! That son of a bitch.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.823
Don't let him get away!
That son of a bitch.

01:10:21.518 --> 01:10:23.169
Follow him! Follow him!

01:10:29.151 --> 01:10:31.887
Stay right there. Stay right there.

01:10:46.377 --> 01:10:47.945
Fuckin' bastard.

01:11:00.726 --> 01:11:02.419
That way.

01:11:04.938 --> 01:11:08.508
Shit! Get outta here. Get outta here!

01:11:08.608 --> 01:11:11.261
Move your ass
or I'll blow your fuckin' head off!

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.736
- What's the problem? I was sound asleep.
- You said this operation was foolproof.

01:12:07.836 --> 01:12:11.115
It is, my friend. Let's talk inside.

01:12:30.318 --> 01:12:34.556
This Joe has only been
a minor inconvenience.

01:12:34.656 --> 01:12:37.767
The shipment will go out
tomorrow as scheduled.

01:12:37.867 --> 01:12:40.895
- No one can stop us now.
- It's gone too far.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.148
Too many people know.

01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:47.569
We've lost the sergeant and four men,
and the bastard's got away.

01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:51.364
- He could be anywhere by now.
- Calm down, my friend. Calm down.

01:12:51.464 --> 01:12:53.534
Come, sit down.

01:12:54.426 --> 01:12:56.495
He is a nobody.

01:12:57.429 --> 01:13:00.666
Even if he finds someone to listen,
who will believe him?

01:13:00.766 --> 01:13:04.920
Where's his proof?
No, it's too late to back out now.

01:13:45.895 --> 01:13:48.947
We can't risk it. We're not shipping it out.

01:13:49.047 --> 01:13:51.827
What about the people you're trying to help?
Have you forgotten about them?

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.364
Like all the government has.

01:13:53.464 --> 01:13:56.515
Without this shipment, their country
could fall to the communists.

01:13:56.616 --> 01:14:00.478
One more domino down.
Who knows what country will be next?

01:14:00.578 --> 01:14:05.650
It stops now. Maybe later, when things
calm down, but now we must stop.

01:14:11.255 --> 01:14:13.658
Let me tell you something, my friend.

01:14:15.509 --> 01:14:19.372
For me, this is not a private
crusade for a noble cause.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.336
I stand to make four million
dollars on this deal. Four.

01:14:25.228 --> 01:14:28.006
And no one is going to
stop me from collecting it.

01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:32.010
I give the orders here, Victor, not you!

01:14:32.152 --> 01:14:35.263
What are you going to do?
Call out your troops?

01:14:35.364 --> 01:14:38.016
Create an international incident?

01:14:38.617 --> 01:14:43.855
It would be very easy for me to reveal
your part in this to your daughter.

01:14:44.331 --> 01:14:47.859
What would your precious
daughter think of you then?

01:14:50.046 --> 01:14:54.700
We're not shipping it out. I'll be there
in the morning to take everything back.

01:14:54.801 --> 01:14:57.203
Now you get out.

01:14:58.888 --> 01:15:02.166
This has been
a very big mistake, my friend.

01:16:33.193 --> 01:16:36.221
You have remembered well.

01:16:36.322 --> 01:16:38.390
It <i>was</i> you.

01:16:38.741 --> 01:16:42.436
- Before the explosion, it was you.
- It is time to remember everything.

01:16:42.578 --> 01:16:44.647
Come.

01:16:51.254 --> 01:16:53.823
The haragei.

01:16:53.965 --> 01:16:56.326
I taught you that when you were six.

01:16:58.345 --> 01:17:00.413
Do you remember?

01:17:03.808 --> 01:17:05.877
When I was six?

01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:13.259
<i>When I was six...</i>

01:17:14.945 --> 01:17:18.724
<i>you taught me many</i>
<i>lessons of the haragei.</i>

01:17:19.075 --> 01:17:21.143
<i>How to free the mind...</i>

01:17:22.119 --> 01:17:24.063
<i>of thought...</i>

01:17:25.581 --> 01:17:27.858
<i>and let the senses grow.</i>

01:17:29.627 --> 01:17:32.363
Yes, I remember.

01:17:32.463 --> 01:17:35.324
You were just a baby
when I first found you.

01:17:35.466 --> 01:17:37.701
I called you Joe.

01:17:37.843 --> 01:17:41.080
That was the only American name I knew.

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.292
<i>I conditioned your body and your senses.</i>

01:17:44.434 --> 01:17:47.170
<i>I only teach you
what you need to know...</i>

01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:52.634
<i>so that when the time comes, you can</i>
<i>take your place on the field of honor...</i>

01:17:52.859 --> 01:17:55.053
<i>and meet your destiny.</i>

01:17:55.445 --> 01:17:58.432
But then the explosion separated us.

01:17:59.699 --> 01:18:01.768
The explosion.

01:18:05.789 --> 01:18:08.358
<i>There's so much I remember...</i>

01:18:10.127 --> 01:18:13.823
but there's also
so much I don't remember.

01:18:14.215 --> 01:18:17.493
I let you forget what you saw
before I found you...

01:18:17.593 --> 01:18:21.289
so that your mind
would not be clouded with pain.

01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:25.251
But now you are ready.

01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:32.466
The time has come for your final lesson.

01:18:32.608 --> 01:18:34.677
Kusari-gama.

01:18:35.069 --> 01:18:37.138
Shuriken.

01:18:38.823 --> 01:18:40.892
Sai.

01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:44.938
Ninja-toh.

01:18:50.127 --> 01:18:54.907
These symbols will focus
the ultimate power of purpose.

01:18:56.925 --> 01:18:58.911
Jin.

01:18:59.011 --> 01:19:01.079
Ritsu.

01:19:01.763 --> 01:19:03.832
Sai.

01:19:04.892 --> 01:19:07.961
- Zen.
- Koba-dera.

01:19:08.353 --> 01:19:11.883
The koba-dera. Ninja magic.

01:19:12.025 --> 01:19:13.301
Intong jutsu.

01:19:13.443 --> 01:19:19.015
The ability to seem invisible, to cause
fear and paralysis in your enemies.

01:19:20.199 --> 01:19:22.518
You are ready, my son.

01:19:22.619 --> 01:19:25.480
I will be with you in deed
and in my heart.

01:19:25.788 --> 01:19:29.817
- Follow the Bushido.
- I will honor the code, Father.

01:19:30.001 --> 01:19:32.070
Beware the Black Star Ninja.

01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:36.491
He has taken the dark path
and has betrayed the code.

01:19:37.008 --> 01:19:40.871
Then... he must die.

01:20:11.002 --> 01:20:13.488
<i>Magnifique.</i> Right on time.

01:20:19.719 --> 01:20:21.871
Everything is working perfectly.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.799
Yes. Do you have the missile?

01:20:32.941 --> 01:20:36.803
The missile is in a container with
everything else. It's all ready to go.

01:20:36.945 --> 01:20:39.140
- Good.
- These are the documents...

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.642
to get the shipment out of the country.

01:20:41.784 --> 01:20:45.479
Everything is...
everyone is taken care of.

01:20:45.621 --> 01:20:47.857
- You can leave without delay.
- Thank you.

01:20:47.998 --> 01:20:50.067
May I see the money?

01:20:50.167 --> 01:20:52.236
Of course.

01:21:04.765 --> 01:21:06.877
Not until we see the merchandise.

01:21:06.977 --> 01:21:10.422
Of course. Right this way.

01:21:22.868 --> 01:21:25.353
Who is he? Is he one of us?

01:21:25.871 --> 01:21:28.565
The American ninja.

01:21:29.499 --> 01:21:31.985
American! What do you want?

01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:38.910
Kill him!

01:21:46.392 --> 01:21:48.461
Get the girl.

01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:52.798
I'll be right back.

01:22:04.995 --> 01:22:07.314
American!

01:22:07.414 --> 01:22:10.525
It was a nice try!
But it wasn't good enough!

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:12.694
I have your girlfriend here!

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:18.367
You have 30 seconds to surrender,
or your girlfriend is dead!

01:22:18.467 --> 01:22:20.327
Joe, don't do it!

01:22:23.055 --> 01:22:25.123
30 seconds!

01:22:25.933 --> 01:22:27.459
I know you can hear me.

01:22:27.559 --> 01:22:31.505
Or maybe you don't like her
as much as she thinks you do?

01:22:39.197 --> 01:22:40.807
Five...

01:22:40.907 --> 01:22:43.226
four...

01:22:45.286 --> 01:22:47.605
- Very good.
- Let her go!

01:22:48.247 --> 01:22:50.733
Letting her go wasn't part of the deal.

01:22:51.542 --> 01:22:53.236
Kill him.

01:23:11.814 --> 01:23:13.632
<i>Calma, calma.</i>

01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:23.559
It's all right. Just relax.

01:23:38.341 --> 01:23:41.411
<i>Víctor, esto es</i>
<i>demasiado riesgo para mí.</i>

01:23:46.182 --> 01:23:47.667
It's all right, believe me.

01:24:42.699 --> 01:24:44.768
Up ahead!

01:25:46.139 --> 01:25:49.001
Hang on, charleys.
I'm taking this bitch uptown.

01:25:49.101 --> 01:25:50.794
Take me home, baby.

01:26:32.146 --> 01:26:34.214
Holy shit.

01:26:57.756 --> 01:27:01.451
Got you tight, huh?
How do you like that in your nuts?

01:27:41.675 --> 01:27:46.080
<i>Mira Víctor, demasiado riesgo.</i>
<i>Para otro día mejor. Me voy.</i>

01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.916
- No, you can't leave. You stay here.
- Next time.

01:27:49.016 --> 01:27:51.085
You stay here!

01:27:56.358 --> 01:27:58.176
Bring the girl.

01:29:00.841 --> 01:29:05.746
- Let her go, Victor!
- Listen to me. All I want is the money.

01:29:05.846 --> 01:29:09.291
Let me go to the helicopter
and your daughter will be free.

01:29:09.391 --> 01:29:12.169
Don't do it! You know I will kill her.

01:29:13.437 --> 01:29:16.214
Hold your fire! Nobody shoot.

01:29:17.441 --> 01:29:19.509
All right, let her go, Victor!

01:29:21.112 --> 01:29:22.722
Let her go!

01:29:23.948 --> 01:29:25.683
Get in.

01:29:26.784 --> 01:29:28.686
Get in. Go! Go!

01:29:32.749 --> 01:29:34.025
Go!

01:29:37.628 --> 01:29:40.740
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait for the ninja.

01:30:47.743 --> 01:30:49.395
Go, go, go!

01:31:21.361 --> 01:31:24.097
Help! Joe!

01:31:45.161 --> 01:31:47.330
Yeah, come on, Joe.

01:31:57.273 --> 01:31:59.383
Get off it, man, get off it.

01:32:04.822 --> 01:32:06.682
All right. Now I gotcha.

01:32:27.471 --> 01:32:29.414
Joe!

01:35:39.294 --> 01:35:42.531
