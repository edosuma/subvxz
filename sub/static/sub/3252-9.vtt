WEBVTT

00:00.020 --> 00:02.000
VOICE TREMBLES: Police, please.

00:03.920 --> 00:05.120
Hello?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.830
Yes.

00:08.880 --> 00:11.510
I know who did it.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.350
Who did it all.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.790
I figured it out.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.750
No. No, I can't speak up.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.070
They might hear me.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.950
HISSING
Oh, no.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.710
Oh, no. Listen.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.430
Listen.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.110
They are everywhere.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.520
All around.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.230
We've been so blind.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.120
HE SCREAMS

00:41.680 --> 00:44.830
PHONE: 'Hello? Sir?

00:44.880 --> 00:47.630
'Are you in a safe place?

00:47.680 --> 00:51.240
'Are you being held against
your will? Sir?'

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.520 --> 01:41.670
You could leave all
that stuff here, you know.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.350
We do have literally acres of room.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.030
Oh, no. It's all right. Danny's
got a little bit territorial.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.470
The idea of me leaving
so much as a toothbrush here...

01:48.520 --> 01:50.590
But, still, he's all right
with us doing this

01:50.640 --> 01:52.110
which I admit's a little bit weird.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.070
Cos you'd think if he had a problem
with me leaving stuff in the TARDIS,

01:55.120 --> 01:58.030
he'd object to me travelling
in the TARDIS. But he's not, so.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.790
Sorry. Stopped listening
a while ago. OK.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.830
Same time you left, same place.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.510
Ish.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.670
Ish?

02:06.720 --> 02:09.190
Don't give me an ish.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.990
These readings are very...

02:11.039 --> 02:12.360
ishy.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.830
Erm, Doctor?

02:22.880 --> 02:23.920
Uh-huh?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.030
Well...

03:08.080 --> 03:11.790
Well, I wonder what caused this?

03:11.840 --> 03:13.680
I don't think we're bigger. Are we?

03:17.240 --> 03:19.630
Bristol? Doctor, we're in Bristol!

03:19.680 --> 03:23.070
And 120 miles from where
we should be. Impressive.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.710
~ No. Not impressive. Annoying.
~ No. This is impressive.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.950
This is annoying.
The TARDIS never does this.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.190
This is huge!

03:29.240 --> 03:33.310
Well, not literally huge,
slightly smaller than usual.

03:33.360 --> 03:37.110
~ Which is huge. ~ Yes. I get it.
You're excited. When can I go home?

03:37.160 --> 03:38.910
Your house isn't going anywhere.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.920
And neither is mine
until I get this figured out.

03:43.040 --> 03:47.710
Could you not just let me enjoy this
moment of not knowing something?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.880
I mean, it happens so rarely.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.230
Look, I don't think
this is dangerous.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.830
But I wouldn't like you
to get squished accidentally.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.110
Anyway, I need you to help me
find out what's caused this.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.830
Fine.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.160
I'll go take a look around.

04:12.360 --> 04:16.279
It's your filth, Rigsy,
start with your signature.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.320
Oh, come on,
there's no need for this.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.560
There you go.

04:35.240 --> 04:39.400
Get on with it. This is community
service, not a holiday camp.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.910
ALARM BLARES

04:50.960 --> 04:52.960
Now, that wasn't me, was it?

05:02.480 --> 05:04.960
Oh, that can't be good.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.360
Cheer up, love. Might never happen.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.830
Have some respect. She's grieving.

05:25.880 --> 05:28.920
Oh, sorry, love. I didn't mean
nothing by it.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.790
Sorry about them. They're idiots.

05:36.840 --> 05:39.630
That's all right, don't worry.
I've heard worse.

05:39.680 --> 05:43.470
I've lost someone, too.
My Aunt Karina.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.510
Deaf as a post. Didn't really know
her that well but she's still gone.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.390
~ Is your one in the mural?
~ Oh, no. I haven't actually...

05:50.440 --> 05:52.750
I'm sure they'll get round
to it at some point.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.750
I'm not really with
that lot out there.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.910
I just have to do this
community service thing.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.080
I just do graffiti. Not anything,
you know, murdery or...

06:02.320 --> 06:04.520
So, erm, what's all this about?

06:06.440 --> 06:08.310
What's happened to all these people?

06:08.360 --> 06:10.240
You mean you don't know?

06:11.520 --> 06:13.950
'Hey, I think I've found something.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.870
'People are missing all
over the estate.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.550
~ Do you think there's a connection?
~ 'Could be.' ~ And where are you?

06:19.600 --> 06:22.430
~ 'Exactly where I was.'
~ No, you're not.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.200
I'm here and I can't see...

06:25.760 --> 06:27.270
Oh.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.310
'Yes. Oh.'

06:29.360 --> 06:30.870
CLARA LAUGHS

06:30.920 --> 06:34.590
~ Oh, my God, that is so adorable.
Are you in there? ~ 'Yes, I am.'

06:34.640 --> 06:36.190
And, no, it's not adorable.

06:36.240 --> 06:39.590
It's very, very serious.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.920
~ 'So is this more shrink ray stuff?
Are you tiny in there?' ~ No.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.750
I'm exactly the same size.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.040
It's merely the exterior
dimensions that have changed.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.350
Stop laughing. This is serious.

06:57.400 --> 07:01.230
I can't help it, can I, with
you and your big old face.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.430
~ How are you going to get out?
~ Well, plainly I can't.

07:03.480 --> 07:06.630
~ Something nearby is leeching all
the external dimensions. ~ Aliens?

07:06.680 --> 07:08.790
Possibly. Oh, who am I kidding?
Probably.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.870
Sensors are down and I can't risk
taking off with it in this state.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.590
Clara, I need you to
pick up the TARDIS.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.630
Carefully. It should be possible.
I've adjusted the relative gravity.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.510
You mean you've made it lighter.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.990
Clara, it's always lighter.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.030
If the TARDIS were to land
with its true weight,

07:27.080 --> 07:28.950
it would fracture the
surface of the earth.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.310
Yeah, maybe a story for
another time. What now?

07:31.360 --> 07:33.390
I've managed to get a rough fix
on the source

07:33.440 --> 07:35.430
of the dimensional leeching.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.760
It's roughly north west. That way.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.360
Please don't do that.
That's just wrong.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.280
Now, listen!

07:48.200 --> 07:49.750
You're going to need these.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.230
Oh, wow.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.950
This is an honour.
Does this mean I'm you now?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
No, it does not,
so don't get any ideas.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.600
And listen, stick this in your ear.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.070
~ Can you hear me? ~ 'Yes.'

08:08.120 --> 08:10.070
~ Ow! What just happened? ~ 'Nanotech.'

08:10.120 --> 08:12.390
~ Just hacked your optic nerve.
~ 'What does that mean?'

08:12.440 --> 08:14.240
I see what you see.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.230
~ Anything? ~ Yes, I'm dizzy.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.710
But nothing useful.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.590
You never did tell me your name.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.040
~ No time to fraternize.
Come on, get rid of him. ~ 'I'm...'

08:30.560 --> 08:33.030
~ I'm the Doctor. ~ Don't you dare.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.390
Doctor Oswald.
But you can call me Clara.

08:36.440 --> 08:40.309
I'm Rigsy.
So what are you a doctor of?

08:40.360 --> 08:42.990
~ Of lies. ~ 'Well, I'm usually
quite vague about that.'

08:43.039 --> 08:45.910
I think I just picked the title
because it makes me sound important.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.830
Why, Doctor Oswald,
you are hilarious(!)

08:47.880 --> 08:49.630
Could we get back to work,
do you think?

08:49.680 --> 08:52.670
What are you exactly? You don't
smell like police but that's some

08:52.720 --> 08:55.390
pretty cool gear you got there.
You like a spy, or something?

08:55.440 --> 08:58.430
Oh, he's a bright one,
hang on to him(!)

08:58.480 --> 09:00.400
He was the last one to go missing.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.030
And when he disappeared all
the doors and windows were locked

09:07.080 --> 09:08.670
from the inside.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.270
'Ooh, now you're talking.
I love a good locked room mystery.'

09:11.320 --> 09:14.030
~ Yeah, doesn't everyone? ~ What?

09:14.080 --> 09:17.270
Huh? Oh, sorry. I'm talking to
somebody else. He's listening in.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.430
Doctor, Rigsy, Rigsy, the Doctor.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.310
~ Hello, barely sentient local.
~ Another Doctor?

09:22.360 --> 09:24.310
How do you sleep at night?

09:24.360 --> 09:27.950
'Missing people, tiny TARDIS,
what's the link?'

09:28.000 --> 09:30.670
I think this is great that
someone's finally looking into this.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.470
The police weren't doing anything.
They never do on this estate.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.870
People were thinking that...

09:35.920 --> 09:38.350
no-one was listening.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.590
That no-one cared.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.950
So, yeah. I think it's great
what you're doing.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.950
I think that we can manage
on our own from now on.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.350
~ I think he could still be useful.
~ 'He's a pudding brain.'

09:46.400 --> 09:48.830
~ Worse than that he's a fluorescent
pudding brain. ~ 'Fine.'

09:48.880 --> 09:52.030
And all those other missing people,
I suppose you know where they lived.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.880
He could still be in the room.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.510
Sorry, what?

09:56.560 --> 09:59.030
Sorry, nothing.
I was just thinking out loud.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.790
'It's like one of those locked room
things you get in books.'

10:01.840 --> 10:05.150
It's always something weird, like,
he's still in the room or something.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.830
Do you want to go and
check out another flat?

10:07.880 --> 10:10.070
Do you know, I think you
were wrong about this lad.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.630
I think that he could be very
useful. Vital local knowledge.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.400
~ Oh, really? ~ Yes. So try not to scare
him off. ~ How would I scare him off?

10:19.880 --> 10:23.040
Maybe he's lost in the desert,
or something.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.950
OK, right, are we missing
something here?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.870
Missing man, locked room,
shrink ray?

10:29.920 --> 10:32.030
Sorry, did you say
just say shrink ray?

10:32.080 --> 10:37.310
What if he is still in this room
like you said - only tiny?

10:37.360 --> 10:39.590
You know, like underneath
the sofa or something.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.510
Clara, this is the scaring off
that we were talking about.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.590
OK. So...

10:44.640 --> 10:48.870
My lunch break's nearly up.
This... this has been...

10:48.920 --> 10:50.310
interesting.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.750
'Clara, local knowledge
is' leaving. Do something!'

10:52.800 --> 10:55.910
Rigsy! One sec.
Doctor, open the doors.

10:55.960 --> 10:59.080
~ I didn't mean that!
~ Look, you want him to stay or not?

11:01.040 --> 11:04.030
You really do throw your companions
in at the deep end, don't you?

11:04.080 --> 11:07.160
Rigsy, come here. Meet the Doctor.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.430
~ So, what do you think? Tiny man
idea. ~ Yes, it's a lovely thought.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.430
Which is why I set the sonic to
scan for that as soon as we entered.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.790
~ Pleased to meet you.
~ And you didn't think to tell me?

11:20.840 --> 11:22.750
Well, of course he might
have been squashed

11:22.800 --> 11:24.230
under a policeman's shoe by now.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.270
It's bigger. On the inside.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.910
Do you know, I don't think that
statement's ever been truer.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.790
What are you?
Like, aliens, or something?

11:31.840 --> 11:32.990
No.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.440
Well, he is.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.910
ALARM BLARES

11:36.960 --> 11:38.400
Doctor?

11:41.040 --> 11:43.270
~ Doctor, did you hear that? ~ Yes.
Whatever it was,

11:43.320 --> 11:46.190
it just drained a massive amount
of energy from inside the TARDIS.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.960
~ What was it? ~ I don't know.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.190
~ That's the least of my problems,
just get us out of there. ~ OK.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.230
Go. Rigsy...

11:54.280 --> 11:56.920
this is where we run. Stick with me.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.950
I mean this is just embarrassing.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.270
I'm from the race
that built the TARDIS,

12:04.320 --> 12:06.710
dimensions are kind of our thing.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.910
So why can't I understand this?

12:08.960 --> 12:11.230
'Clara, I need more info.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.790
'Where else have
people disappeared?'

12:13.840 --> 12:17.360
~ MI5? ~ Yes, this case
has... got our attention.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.990
Well, you've come to
the right place, ma'am.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.710
First reported disappearance,
a Mr Heath.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.590
It's not on the estate, but it's
exactly the same MO as the rest...

12:26.640 --> 12:29.830
Clara, I think that your shrink
ray theory was wrong.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.470
My shrink ray theory? I thought you
were already scanning for that.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.310
Doctor? What are you doing?

12:35.360 --> 12:37.390
It just struck me.
Locked room mysteries.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.790
Classic solution number one -
they're still in the room.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.590
Classic solution number two -
they're in the walls.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.310
What do you mean, they're in the...?

12:44.360 --> 12:47.030
Have we done as much as we could?
No.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.630
Do we have any suspects? No.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.390
Off the record, I think the top
brass are hoping if they ignore this

12:53.440 --> 12:55.800
it'll all just go away.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.870
Apparently they're in the walls.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.360
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

13:04.400 --> 13:06.710
PC Forrest.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.790
Yes, sir. MI5, sir.

13:09.840 --> 13:13.030
So, you and that bloke in a box.
You do this sort of stuff a lot?

13:13.080 --> 13:16.590
Well, he's usually out of the box.
But, yep.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.560
I don't know.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.560
Maybe they thought
we weren't doing enough, sir.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.240
CRUNCHING

13:33.320 --> 13:35.400
Can I call you back?

13:42.040 --> 13:43.230
So how'd you get this gig?

13:43.280 --> 13:45.310
You study science,
or aliens, or something?

13:45.360 --> 13:46.710
CLARA LAUGHS

13:46.760 --> 13:49.070
No. Well, it's kind of a more
of a right place, right time

13:49.120 --> 13:51.630
or wrong place, wrong time
depending on how he's behaving.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.280
'I can hear you, you know.'

14:00.240 --> 14:02.720
Ma'am, there's something in here,
I think.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.560
SHE SCREAMS

14:10.640 --> 14:12.480
SHE SCREAMS

14:14.960 --> 14:16.680
PC Forrest?

14:23.280 --> 14:24.920
Hello?

14:28.600 --> 14:30.360
Hello?

14:32.120 --> 14:33.950
Doctor, she's gone.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.790
What am I missing?

14:35.840 --> 14:40.320
The TARDIS should be able to detect
anything in the known universe.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.520
The known universe.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.120
This universe.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.550
Clara, wait, go back.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.960
'Back, back, back that mural.'

14:59.640 --> 15:03.910
That is a nervous system
scaled up and flattened.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.710
'I think we've found PC Forrest.
What's left of her, at least.'

15:06.760 --> 15:08.600
Her nervous system.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.350
The mural in the flat.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.550
That wasn't a desert at all.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.400
~ It's a microscopic
blow up of human skin. ~ What?

15:19.640 --> 15:23.910
~ Why? ~ Whatever they are,
they are experimenting.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.790
They're testing.
They're... they are dissecting.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.470
Trying to understand us.
Trying to understand...

15:29.520 --> 15:31.200
three dimensions.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.150
The handle.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.990
Doctor. The handle,
they've flattened the handle.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.990
Fascinating.
Clara, they're in the walls!

15:46.040 --> 15:48.600
Keep away from them,
if they touch you, you're finished.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.710
What happens if they touch us?

15:57.760 --> 16:00.440
~ HISSING
~ I really don't want to find out.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.920
They can't jump, can they?
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

16:14.200 --> 16:15.510
Hey, you.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.350
I've got our bench.
Did you get held up?

16:18.400 --> 16:22.270
Just a little. Sorry, Danny.
I think lunch is a bust.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.590
Oh, hon, you're missing
some classic park action.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.270
Clara, the window!

16:27.320 --> 16:29.640
Look! Look!
They're climbing the walls.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.960
Who was that?

16:34.360 --> 16:37.030
That's just a guy on community
support and I'm helping him...

16:37.080 --> 16:38.310
find his auntie.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.990
Nice. Not technically lying.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.190
~ CLARA GRUNTS
~ Sounds kind of... active.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.070
Um, yeah...

16:45.120 --> 16:47.910
There was a thing, um... a thing.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.750
Where are you
and are you in trouble?

16:50.800 --> 16:52.640
No, no, no, I'm fine!

16:55.360 --> 16:57.030
GLASS SMASHES AND SCREAMS

16:57.080 --> 16:58.870
Clara?

16:58.920 --> 17:00.390
Clara?

17:00.440 --> 17:02.430
~ CAR ALARM
~ Danny? ~ What's happening?

17:02.480 --> 17:05.760
Oh, not much, just some nonsense.

17:08.440 --> 17:11.800
~ Long story. ~ What story?
~ Tell you later, love you!

17:14.040 --> 17:15.760
This explains everything.

17:17.079 --> 17:21.150
They're from a universe
with only two dimensions.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.869
And, yes, that is a thing.
It's long been theorised.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.430
Of course, but no-one could
go there and prove its existence

17:27.480 --> 17:29.910
without a heck of a diet.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.750
And what long story are
you going to tell Danny, huh?

17:32.800 --> 17:35.430
~ Or haven't you made it up yet?
~ 'Sorry, what? What was that?'

17:35.480 --> 17:37.390
'Excellent lying, Dr Oswald.'

17:37.440 --> 17:40.190
Yeah? Well, thought it
was pretty weak myself.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.910
I meant to me.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.630
You told me that Danny was OK with
you being back on board the TARDIS.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.310
~ Well, he is. ~ Yeah, because he
doesn't know anything about it.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.750
~ Doctor... ~ 'Congratulations.
Lying is a vital survival skill.'

17:51.800 --> 17:54.950
~ Well, there you go.
~ And a terrible habit.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.310
~ STATIC
~ Doctor, you're breaking up a bit.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.950
~ STATIC ~ ON LINE: Yeah, of course I am.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.520
~ No, really, you are,
I can't hear you. ~ What?

18:03.040 --> 18:06.230
Oh, right, blowing out that window's
probably affected the earpiece.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.480
~ Take it out and sonic it. ~ Doing it.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.110
Hey!

18:13.160 --> 18:14.910
They can't do that. Hey!

18:14.960 --> 18:16.270
What you doing?

18:16.320 --> 18:20.070
Our job. You're on report, by
the way. Late back from lunch.

18:20.120 --> 18:23.110
Does it even still count as lying if
you're doing for someone's own good?

18:23.160 --> 18:26.240
Well, like, technically
their own good.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.630
It's a memorial!

18:29.680 --> 18:33.000
Council didn't approve it,
it's graffiti. Stan.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.070
Look, Clara. Talk to me, talk to me!

18:41.120 --> 18:42.720
'What are you doing?'

18:46.000 --> 18:48.470
Clara, the mural. Clara,
it's the mural!

18:48.520 --> 18:50.990
Over there, look, the mural!

18:51.040 --> 18:54.280
We've found the missing people,
they're in the walls!

18:58.080 --> 19:01.150
~ What do I do? ~ Act normal.
But get everyone out.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.990
They're very realistic.
Who painted them?

19:04.040 --> 19:06.950
I don't know. A local artist.
Probably a grieving relative.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.750
Did you ever meet them? Or did
they just appear after people...

19:10.800 --> 19:12.230
disappeared?

19:12.280 --> 19:15.070
And who are you
when you're at home, love?

19:15.120 --> 19:18.950
Health and safety. This subway
is unsafe. Everyone needs to leave.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.510
Right now.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.400
This is blank.
Try again, sweetheart.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.470
~ What? ~ What?

19:27.520 --> 19:30.230
It takes quite a lack of imagination
to beat psychic paper.

19:30.280 --> 19:33.150
~ Stan. Do your job. ~ Clara, stop him!

19:33.200 --> 19:34.950
STAN SCREAMS

19:35.000 --> 19:36.480
Stan!

19:41.440 --> 19:44.030
What is this?

19:44.080 --> 19:45.830
What are they?

19:45.880 --> 19:48.360
'They're wearing
the dead like camouflage.'

19:50.280 --> 19:52.510
Forget Stan, your friend's gone.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.310
'Clara, get them out of there!'

19:55.360 --> 19:57.760
We need to move. Now.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.390
Did they follow us?
Cos I didn't see them follow us.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.750
~ Are we safe? ~ Are we really hiding
from killer graffiti?

20:19.800 --> 20:21.270
This is insane.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.230
I agree. We'll have to think of a
better name for them than that.

20:24.280 --> 20:27.630
And Stan was one of them...
Flattened, dead.

20:27.680 --> 20:30.750
~ But coming after us.
~ 'Clara, this is a vital stage.'

20:30.800 --> 20:33.430
This little group is currently
confused and disorientated,

20:33.480 --> 20:35.510
'but pretty soon a leader
is going to emerge.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.790
~ 'You need to make sure that
leader is you.' ~ I'm on it.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.390
George. George, isn't it?
Can you watch that area?

20:42.440 --> 20:44.670
You hear anything, anything moves,
you shout, OK?

20:44.720 --> 20:47.590
He will do no such thing
until I get some answers.

20:47.640 --> 20:50.550
Who are you?
That's what I want to know.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.950
Impersonating a government official.
Trespassing on council property.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.200
~ Seriously? ~ Seriously.
~ Fine, I'll tell you who I am.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.160
I am the one chance
you've got of staying alive.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.560
That's who I am.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.040
Well done.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.310
Rigsy, how well
do you know this area?

21:13.360 --> 21:14.750
Do you know where that door leads?

21:14.800 --> 21:16.830
It's the old Brunswick line.
But it's not safe.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.230
~ Well, there's safe and
there's safe. ~ Yeah, I know it.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.790
~ I used to go down there all the time.
~ Yeah, I'll bet you did.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.230
~ Painting your filth. ~ Yeah, well,
you might be glad he did.

21:24.280 --> 21:27.280
Those things come in here,
that is our only way out.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.230
I just hope I can keep
them all alive.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.910
Ah, welcome to my world.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.950
So what's next, Doctor Clara?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.390
~ Lie to them. ~ 'What?'

21:38.440 --> 21:41.910
Lie to them. Give them hope. Tell
them they're all going to be fine.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.230
~ Isn't that what you would do?
~ In a manner of speaking.

21:45.280 --> 21:48.230
It's true that people with hope
tend to run faster.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.590
~ Whereas people who think
they're doomed... ~ Dawdle.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.310
End up dead.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.870
So that's what I sound like.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.990
~ Who's she talking to?
~ He says it's MI5.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.070
Right, here's something
that might help you.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.270
Do you remember the graffiti from
the estate? Footprints, tyre treads?

22:02.320 --> 22:04.470
~ Vaguely. ~ 'Well, I don't think
it was graffiti.'

22:04.520 --> 22:06.790
I think that is how
these creatures saw us.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.070
The impressions we make
in two dimensional space.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.870
That was them reaching out.
Attempting to talk.

22:11.920 --> 22:15.230
At which point they moved
into flattening and dissection.

22:15.280 --> 22:18.350
Trying to understand.
Trying to emulate.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.870
But here's the big question,
do they know they're hurting us?

22:21.920 --> 22:24.510
'So what? You think this is
all one big misunderstanding?'

22:24.560 --> 22:27.440
'That's a very good question.
Why don't we ask them?'

22:30.640 --> 22:32.800
STATIC

22:33.800 --> 22:36.870
'We need to find a way
to communicate.'

22:36.920 --> 22:38.550
Why can't the TARDIS just translate?

22:38.600 --> 22:41.670
Because their idea of language
is just as bizarre

22:41.720 --> 22:44.630
as their idea of space.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.430
Even the TARDIS is confused.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.230
'This is a bad idea.'

22:48.280 --> 22:49.990
What makes this colleague of yours

22:50.040 --> 22:52.430
think those monsters
even want to talk?

22:52.480 --> 22:56.390
I know a race made of sentient
gas who throw fireballs

22:56.440 --> 22:57.760
as a friendly wave.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.750
I know another race
with 64 stomachs

23:02.800 --> 23:05.550
who talk to each other
by disembowelling.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.630
~ He's got a hunch. ~ 'My point being
that in a universe as immense

23:08.680 --> 23:11.950
'and bizarre as this one,
you cannot be too quick to judge.'

23:12.000 --> 23:14.310
Perhaps these creatures
don't even understand

23:14.360 --> 23:16.760
that we need three dimensions
to live in.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.990
They may not even know
that they're hurting us.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.630
~ Do you really believe that?
~ 'No. I really hope that.'

23:23.680 --> 23:26.110
It would make a nice change,
wouldn't it?

23:26.160 --> 23:27.630
OK.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.510
Let's start with pi.

23:29.560 --> 23:31.790
Even in a flat world
they would have circles.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.840
I don't mean edible pie,
I mean circular pi.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.350
Which I realise would also
mean edible pie but...

23:38.400 --> 23:39.720
Anyway.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.320
CHIRRUPING

23:47.600 --> 23:49.870
They're responding.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.790
'The TARDIS is translating now.
It's a number.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.990
~ '55.' ~ 55.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.470
What does that mean?

23:56.520 --> 23:58.750
Tenth Fibonacci number.
Atomic number of caesium.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.110
I know what it means.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.990
We all have numbers on our jackets.
Have to sign them out.

24:03.040 --> 24:06.270
'That was the number on
Stan's jacket, the man they
flattened in the subway.'

24:06.320 --> 24:08.470
~ They're gloating.
~ We don't know that.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.270
It could be an apology,
for all we know.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.230
~ Really? That's nice of them(!)>
~ An apology? Are you seriously...

24:13.280 --> 24:16.670
~ CHIRRUPING
~ Sssh, sssh, sssh. Listen.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.080
Wait.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.350
'2-2. 22.'

24:21.400 --> 24:23.230
22.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.160
That's George.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.590
Looks like your number's up,
George.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.030
Now they're threatening.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.990
Maybe. Or maybe they're
showing us they can read.

24:39.040 --> 24:41.990
Oh, grow up.
They're picking targets.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.470
~ Of course you'd see it that way.>
~ What do you mean by that?

24:44.520 --> 24:46.710
~ George? ~ Everyone's out to get you,
aren't they?

24:46.760 --> 24:48.360
In this case, they kind of are.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.720
Clara, be careful.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.240
The tunnel!

25:10.880 --> 25:12.230
'Doctor, they've got George.'

25:12.280 --> 25:14.430
~ I know. ~ 'What now?'

25:14.480 --> 25:17.120
Give me a minute. I'm working on it.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.950
Another flat handle.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.520
They were here.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.390
Not now. They've stopped chasing us,
I think.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.070
It feels like they're cornering us.

25:31.120 --> 25:35.190
'You can't apply human logic,
you're dealing with
creatures from another dimension.'

25:35.240 --> 25:38.630
That's three exits
all blocked by those creatures.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.910
Rigsy, where's the next exit?

25:40.960 --> 25:43.710
The only other one I can think of is
where the old line joins the new,

25:43.760 --> 25:46.630
but it's a fair walk. Getting through
that door would be quicker.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.310
~ But we can't, can we?
~ I'm just saying.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.830
'Clara, I might be able to help
with that door.'

25:51.880 --> 25:53.360
Give me five minutes.

25:59.760 --> 26:02.150
It's one of mine. Do you like it?

26:02.200 --> 26:04.310
Yeah, not bad.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.030
So this thing you're working on?

26:06.080 --> 26:08.870
'I think I've figured out a way
to restore three dimensions.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.150
'At least on a small scale,'

26:10.200 --> 26:12.270
~ say, door handles.
~ 'So, what's that, then?'

26:12.320 --> 26:15.710
~ A de-flattener? ~ 'We're not calling
it a de-flattener.'

26:15.760 --> 26:18.230
This should be able to
restore dimensions.

26:18.280 --> 26:19.670
'You see what I've called it?'

26:19.720 --> 26:22.310
~ "2Dis." Two Dee Iz?
~ No. "Twodis"!

26:22.360 --> 26:24.430
It's called the "Twodis."

26:24.480 --> 26:26.310
Why'd I even bother?

26:26.360 --> 26:28.000
Well, give it a go, then.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.920
Long way round it is.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.910
ALARM BLARES

26:45.960 --> 26:49.390
Clara, I don't know how,
but they're doing it again,
they're leeching the TARDIS!

26:49.440 --> 26:51.630
'How?! Your doors are closed.'

26:51.680 --> 26:55.070
~ They've changed frequency.
This time, it's different. ~ Listen!

26:55.120 --> 26:58.790
~ The Doctor thinks we might be in
trouble, he thinks they might be
close. ~ Where, exactly?

26:58.840 --> 27:01.470
I don't know. He's not sure.
He's getting readings all around.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.070
Oh, that's just great(!)

27:03.120 --> 27:05.470
Sounds important
but means absolutely nothing.

27:05.520 --> 27:06.710
Can you tell your friend...

27:06.760 --> 27:08.830
Aaaargh!

27:08.880 --> 27:13.560
Aaaaaaaaargh!

27:15.200 --> 27:17.150
Of course. The next stage.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.280
3D.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.000
Run!

27:31.960 --> 27:33.070
Doctor? The door!

27:33.120 --> 27:35.710
~ 'The handle's flattened!'
~ I've boosted the output.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.070
And it will work this time?

27:37.120 --> 27:38.720
Absolutely.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.870
'Clara, stop. Use it again,
it can reverse the process.'

27:51.920 --> 27:54.950
There's a ladder at the end of this.
If we get down into the tunnel,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.680
~ we can make it into daylight.
~ Hang on! Hang on.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.750
If it's flat, we're safe now,
aren't we?

28:02.800 --> 28:05.040
~ They can't get through, can they?
~ Wait!

28:14.080 --> 28:16.030
They have a new ability.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.950
Of course they have.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.520
Now they're 3D,
they can restore dimensions.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.830
'Clara, do you want the good
news or the bad news?'

28:26.880 --> 28:29.510
We're in the bad news!
I'm living the bad news!

28:29.560 --> 28:32.550
The good news is I've come up with
a theoretical way to send them

28:32.600 --> 28:34.510
~ back to their own dimension.
~ Do it! Now!

28:34.560 --> 28:35.630
'And that's the bad news.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.670
'The TARDIS doesn't have enough
dimensional energy to pull it off.'

28:38.720 --> 28:40.550
Great(!) What do you want me
to do about it?

28:40.600 --> 28:43.390
Apparently these things can pump it
out as fast as they can steal it.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.070
Maybe if I ask them really nicely,
they'll fill you up again.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.160
~ Give me that machine! ~ Hey!
~ Hand it over! ~ Doctor?

28:50.400 --> 28:55.120
ALARM SOUNDS

28:57.000 --> 28:59.040
Hello? Doctor?

29:00.120 --> 29:03.840
Look, can we please deal with this
later? Because we need to move.

29:07.760 --> 29:09.390
'Doctor?

29:09.440 --> 29:12.160
~ 'Doctor, I dropped you down a hole.
Where are you?' ~ I don't know.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.070
My shields have gone!

29:17.120 --> 29:19.120
Structural integrity is failing.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.520
Another blow like that
and I've had it.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.960
I'm on the train lines.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.830
And there's a train coming.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.280
Of course there is.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.750
Short-term re-materialisation?
Not enough power.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.230
Teleport? Not enough power.

29:39.280 --> 29:42.630
Re-route the heart of
the TARDIS through -
not enough power! Not enough power!

29:42.680 --> 29:44.830
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

29:44.880 --> 29:46.550
'Can't you move the TARDIS?'

29:46.600 --> 29:49.710
Clara, there is no power. The TARDIS
couldn't boil an egg at the moment.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.830
Do what you can to get
those people out of there.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.670
'You're stronger than you know.'

29:53.720 --> 29:55.710
I wonder what
they're like with ladders?

29:55.760 --> 29:57.230
No, I mean you move the TARDIS.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.440
Like Addams Family.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.400
Ha!

30:48.760 --> 30:50.950
STATIC ON LINE

30:51.000 --> 30:52.440
Doctor?

30:55.360 --> 30:56.710
Doctor?

30:56.760 --> 30:59.150
They'd be here if they were coming.
Where are they?

30:59.200 --> 31:01.830
There's no other way down. Right?

31:01.880 --> 31:04.150
Hey! I'm talking to you.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.590
There is.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.830
An old service elevator
near the mouth of the tunnel.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.680
We should go.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.240
Oh, no.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.830
And there's another train coming.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.400
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

31:42.080 --> 31:44.790
I don't know if you can
still hear me out there

31:44.840 --> 31:48.240
but the TARDIS is now in siege mode.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.030
No way in,

31:51.080 --> 31:52.160
no way out.

31:53.480 --> 31:56.710
I managed to turn it on
just before the train hit.

31:56.760 --> 32:00.040
But there's not enough
power left now to turn it off.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.710
What's going on?

32:04.760 --> 32:05.990
Why the red light?

32:06.040 --> 32:08.030
MI5. We've got a, uh...

32:08.080 --> 32:10.190
.. blockage. In the tunnel.

32:10.240 --> 32:12.390
Can we ram the... blockage.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.710
The train's empty, isn't it?

32:14.760 --> 32:15.910
Yeah, it's out of service.

32:15.960 --> 32:18.430
But you'd need someone to hold
the dead man's handle.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.230
Won't run without it.

32:20.280 --> 32:23.830
Is this official? Because I've always
wanted to ram something.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.520
Can we rig it to drive without that?
Send it in with no driver?

32:32.600 --> 32:34.240
Rigsy!

32:41.680 --> 32:43.630
Er, what are you doing?

32:43.680 --> 32:45.630
I'm going to ram them,
buy you some time.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.190
~ You'll die.
~ Yeah, course I'll die. Now go!

32:48.240 --> 32:51.470
~ Why do you want to do that?
~ Just go, OK? Let me do this.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.670
OK, fine, yeah.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.550
And I'll always remember you.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.880
~ Fine. Great...
~ Cos I was just going to do this.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.710
No driver required.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.390
And I really like that hair band.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.470
But I suppose I'll just take it,
will I?

33:04.520 --> 33:05.830
And every time I look at it,

33:05.880 --> 33:07.920
I'll remember the hero
who died to save it.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.830
Come on. You're not getting off
that lightly,

33:12.880 --> 33:14.680
there's work that needs doing.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.160
Oh!

33:36.840 --> 33:38.840
I quite liked that hair band.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.440
What is it?

33:52.800 --> 33:54.320
I think it's the TARDIS.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.790
They wear your skin?

34:11.840 --> 34:13.790
I never thought I'd say this,
this is insane,

34:13.840 --> 34:16.389
but I think preferred them
when they were flat.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.230
What do you mean flat?

34:18.280 --> 34:19.870
Doctor?

34:19.920 --> 34:22.230
STATIC

34:22.280 --> 34:24.080
Doctor?

34:27.280 --> 34:28.639
What would you do now?

34:33.440 --> 34:35.480
No. What will I do now?

34:36.679 --> 34:38.469
OK, OK.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.070
OK.

34:40.120 --> 34:44.870
OK, the last thing the Doctor said
was that the TARDIS needed energy.

34:44.920 --> 34:48.040
He said if it gets energy,
he can beat them.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.600
No, no, no. What are you doing?

35:21.480 --> 35:24.230
Leave her. She's lost it.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.390
~ Are you OK? ~ Yeah, are you?

35:26.440 --> 35:27.790
I think I will be. What's this?

35:27.840 --> 35:30.230
Come on, Graffiti Boy,
I've got a commission for you.

35:30.280 --> 35:34.480
~ I'm flattered but I don't think
this is the time... ~ Well, fine, if
you don't think you're up to it.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.680
What do you need, exactly?

36:02.880 --> 36:04.430
You're going to get us killed.

36:04.480 --> 36:05.670
This plan is insane.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.670
You want to walk? Walk.
You want to stay? Then shush!

36:08.720 --> 36:10.480
They're coming!>

36:31.320 --> 36:32.800
Life support - failing.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.840
I don't know if you'll ever
hear this, Clara...

36:39.440 --> 36:41.800
I don't even know
if you're still alive out there.

36:45.840 --> 36:47.160
But you were good.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.120
And you made a mighty fine Doctor.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.270
It's not working.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.910
You've killed us all.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.510
This is going to save us?

37:08.560 --> 37:10.470
Pumping energy into the wall?

37:10.520 --> 37:13.150
No. Not into the wall.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.590
Through the wall.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.550
Rule number one
of being the Doctor -

37:17.600 --> 37:19.800
use your enemy's power
against them.

37:29.760 --> 37:33.400
They can't restore three dimensions
to a door that never existed.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.320
It worked.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.230
They charged the TARDIS.

38:10.280 --> 38:13.310
I tried to talk.
I want you to remember that.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.470
I tried to reach out,

38:15.520 --> 38:17.350
I tried to understand you,

38:17.400 --> 38:19.710
but I think that you
understand us perfectly.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.830
'And I think you just don't care.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.950
'And I don't know
whether you are here to invade,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.870
'infiltrate or just replace us.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.670
I don't suppose it really
matters now. You are monsters.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.550
That is the role
you seem determined to play.

38:33.600 --> 38:37.480
So it seems I must play mine.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.600
The man that stops the monsters.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.990
I'm sending you back to your own
dimension.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.270
Who knows? Some of you may even
survive the trip.

38:48.320 --> 38:52.830
And, if you do, remember this -
you are not welcome here.

38:52.880 --> 38:56.280
This plane is protected.
I am the Doctor.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.470
And I name you The Boneless.

39:02.520 --> 39:04.800
BOOM

39:32.240 --> 39:33.550
BILL SIGHS

39:33.600 --> 39:34.800
CHUCKLING

39:37.720 --> 39:40.800
Hi, Mum. It's me.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.070
You all right?

39:44.120 --> 39:46.750
I'm alive and I've been inside that.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.390
I think I'm up on the deal.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.350
Come here.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.240
Thank you.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.200
You look chipper.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.470
~ Do people still say chipper?
~ Apparently.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.990
Are you OK?

40:05.040 --> 40:06.190
I'm alive.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.350
And a lot of people died.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.270
It's like a forest fire, isn't it?

40:09.320 --> 40:13.070
The objective is to save the great
trees, not the brushwood. Am I right?

40:13.120 --> 40:15.710
It wasn't a fire, those weren't
trees, those were people.

40:15.760 --> 40:19.550
They were community-payback
scumbags, I wouldn't lose any sleep.

40:19.600 --> 40:20.710
I bet you wouldn't.

40:20.760 --> 40:24.510
It's good to be alive though.
Thank you! Seriously, thank you.

40:24.560 --> 40:27.870
Yes, a lot of people died
and maybe the wrong people survived.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.230
~ Yeah, but we saved the world, right?
~ We did.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.710
You did.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.110
~ OK, so, on balance... ~ Balance?

40:35.160 --> 40:37.150
Yeah, that's how you think,
isn't it?

40:37.200 --> 40:39.110
Largely
so other people don't have to.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.710
Yeah, well, I was you today.
I was the Doctor.

40:41.760 --> 40:44.710
And, apparently,
I was quite good at it.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.630
You heard that, did you?

40:46.680 --> 40:48.470
Yeah, but the power was going off

40:48.520 --> 40:52.280
~ so I suppose you were delirious.
You didn't know what you were
saying. ~ Yes.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.430
Ah! The return of the
fluorescent pudding brain!

40:58.480 --> 41:01.270
~ You do realise he can hear you now?
~ I know.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.830
Your last painting was
so good it saved the world.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.910
I can't wait to see
what you do next.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.470
RIGSY CHUCKLES

41:07.520 --> 41:09.190
It's not going to be easy.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.910
I've got a hair band to live up to.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.230
SHE CHUCKLES

41:12.280 --> 41:13.640
~ Thanks. ~ Come here.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.470
Admit it. I did well!

41:30.520 --> 41:32.310
PHONE RINGS

41:32.360 --> 41:33.680
Is that PE?

41:35.560 --> 41:38.080
Just say it.
Why can't you just say it?

41:39.520 --> 41:41.150
Why can't you just say I did good?

41:41.200 --> 41:43.550
~ Talk to soldier-boy.
~ It's not him.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.910
Come on, why can't you say it?

41:45.960 --> 41:47.950
I was the Doctor and I was good.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.190
~ You were an exceptional Doctor,
