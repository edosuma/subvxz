WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:02.975
Previously on Grimm.

00:03.036 --> 00:05.846
I hate this model.
It's a deathtrap.

00:05.905 --> 00:07.282
Look, it's trying to kill me.

00:08.808 --> 00:10.185
I saw it with my own two eyes.

00:10.243 --> 00:11.449
I was in his house.

00:11.511 --> 00:15.459
Okay, so where does he live, Mr.
"I Saw A Grimm And Lived To Tell About It"?

00:15.515 --> 00:17.017
They were parked across the street.

00:17.083 --> 00:20.030
One of them was taking pictures of our
house. The other one had binoculars.

00:20.086 --> 00:21.656
Got a name and address
on the truck you saw.

00:21.721 --> 00:22.791
So what do we do?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.267
Okay, we don't do anything.

00:24.324 --> 00:25.826
I'll have somebody take care of it.

00:50.183 --> 00:51.719
RYAN'S WIFE: Hey, honey,
what's going on?

00:51.785 --> 00:53.196
Just got to the opening.

00:53.253 --> 00:56.860
I'm sorry I couldn't join you.
So what do you think?

00:58.224 --> 00:59.430
Not really my taste.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.062
How is it? See anything you like?

01:01.795 --> 01:04.138
Yeah. Interesting work.

01:05.031 --> 01:08.012
A little Modigliani meets Matisse.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.275
You're much more of an
abstract kind of a guy.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.606
I miss you

01:12.672 --> 01:16.552
I miss you too. Okay,
I'll see you in the morning.

01:16.609 --> 01:17.917
I can't wait to get home

01:17.977 --> 01:19.547
Love you. Love you too.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.030
I hate it.

01:35.762 --> 01:39.073
Too bad. I think it's pretty good.

01:52.879 --> 01:56.088
If you like this one, I don't think
I'm going to be able to sleep tonight.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.924
This piece exemplifies focus

01:59.986 --> 02:03.331
on the use of color as a
means of emotive expression.

02:04.090 --> 02:08.128
By avoiding a more literal
transcription of human nature,

02:08.595 --> 02:11.872
he clearly comprises the
basic tenets of Fauvism.

02:11.931 --> 02:12.932
Really?

02:15.101 --> 02:16.444
Doesn't mean it's good.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.510
Are you a painter?

02:19.806 --> 02:21.547
Why? I'm a collector.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.282
What are you collecting tonight?

02:24.344 --> 02:25.948
No, nothing here.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.490
I was just thinking about leaving.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.422
You wouldn't want to have a
drink with me and keep talking

02:31.484 --> 02:32.554
by any chance, would you?

02:33.786 --> 02:37.165
Thanks, but no. I have to go.

03:06.419 --> 03:09.298
Okay, I just have one question.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.058
What the hell is Fauvism?

03:12.458 --> 03:14.301
You're a collector
and you don't know?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.636
No. I collect what
I'm attracted to.

03:18.831 --> 03:21.072
It's a style of Les Fauves,

03:21.668 --> 03:23.511
which is French for wild beast.

03:24.337 --> 03:28.012
Loosely comprised of early
twentieth century modern artists

03:28.074 --> 03:30.987
who used wild brush
strokes and bold colors,

03:31.044 --> 03:32.079
while their subject matter

03:32.145 --> 03:35.718
exhibited a high degree of
simplification and abstraction.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.689
Much like a man trying
to pick up a woman.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.531
Here I was trying to be abstract,

03:41.588 --> 03:44.125
but I guess I wound up
being pretty simple.

03:45.592 --> 03:48.129
All successful creative
endeavors are simple.

03:49.262 --> 03:50.764
So I must have a chance.

04:08.681 --> 04:09.682
Well.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.358
I really can't stay.

04:13.119 --> 04:16.464
Oh, I hope the print didn't
put you in the wrong mood.

04:16.522 --> 04:20.334
No. It's not you. I'm sorry.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.667
Look, I think you just
need to relax a little bit.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.122
You don't understand.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.988
No, you don't understand!

04:56.029 --> 04:57.531
You know exactly why you came here.

05:10.009 --> 05:12.455
Oh. Okay, baby.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.026
Oh, no!

06:14.607 --> 06:15.677
Is it working now?

06:15.742 --> 06:17.449
Not in the sense that
I can see anything.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.683
Oh, my gosh. It should be working.
I don't get it.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.225
And please just let me try.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.760
No, no, no, no, all right.
How about now?

06:23.816 --> 06:25.989
Are you using input or output?

06:26.652 --> 06:27.653
Oh!

06:32.458 --> 06:33.459
What was that?

06:33.860 --> 06:35.032
We just got egged-

06:39.766 --> 06:40.767
Stay here.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.440
No. I'm coming too.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.948
Not unless you have a gun.
And you don't.

06:46.272 --> 06:48.946
One gun in the house
is enough. Thank you.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.221
What the hell are you doing?

06:58.951 --> 07:00.430
It's just kids.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.400
Gun! Run!

07:03.589 --> 07:05.034
Yeah, well, they egged our window.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.095
Nick, come on, they're
probably scared to death.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.337
Maybe this is a little overkill.

07:12.398 --> 07:13.877
You think?

07:15.201 --> 07:16.908
Come on, let's go.

07:18.137 --> 07:21.141
I used to do crap like that all
the time when I was little.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.723
You're kids. You dare each
other to do stupid stuff.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.555
There was this really,
really old guy who lived on our block

07:31.617 --> 07:35.224
and we all thought that
he looked like a troll

07:35.288 --> 07:37.962
so we'd always dare each other
to run across his backyard,

07:38.024 --> 07:40.368
which seemed really scary.

07:40.426 --> 07:43.532
Well, my dad said
that he was a war hero

07:43.596 --> 07:45.974
who'd been really badly
injured in one of the wars.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.636
That's why he looked
the way he did.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.414
Wait, so you're telling me you think
these kids think I'm a monster?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.950
No. Don't be ridiculous.

07:53.005 --> 07:57.044
I'm just saying that we haven't exactly
been the quiet neighbors next door.

07:58.611 --> 07:59.954
No, I guess we haven't.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.889
Maybe that's something
we could work on.

08:04.283 --> 08:07.560
Two Eisbiber kids egged
my house last night.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.497
You're the monster under the bed.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.759
I think some Wesen found out
you're a Grimm and they're curious.

08:12.825 --> 08:13.826
What's a Wesen?

08:13.926 --> 08:16.566
You know, Blutbaden,
Fuchsbau, Wildschwein,

08:16.629 --> 08:19.473
those of us the Grimms have been
trying to eradicate for centuries.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.307
You know, I'm not like that.

08:21.367 --> 08:22.869
Dude, join the misunderstood.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.881
Try telling people
I don't eat meat.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.551
It's like I told you
when we first met.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.844
None of us have ever seen
a Grimm before, you know?

08:30.910 --> 08:33.447
You're not real. You're a
scary story we tell our kids,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.390
"Be good or a Grimm will
come cut your head off."

08:35.448 --> 08:38.054
Okay, so now I'm on some
kind of Grimm grapevine?

08:38.116 --> 08:40.461
You're big news in the Wesen world.

08:40.553 --> 08:43.033
Look, it's not them
who I'm worried about.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.592
It's who they're going to tell
and who they're going to tell.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.767
You got to deal with that
before it gets any worse.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.631
How's it going with Juliette?
You tell her anything yet?

08:51.697 --> 08:54.507
Ah, not quite.

08:56.102 --> 08:59.481
Nada? Zip? Diddly?

09:00.139 --> 09:01.140
Yeah.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.884
I guess Grimms aren't
that brave after all.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.252
No, no, I got it. Death calls. Shh!

09:13.185 --> 09:15.461
Yeah, what do you got?
Have a nice day.

09:16.155 --> 09:17.327
Where?

09:17.456 --> 09:20.801
Victim's Ryan Showalter, 28.
Stock analyst with Mindel, Brandt and Zoic.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.237
Neighbors hear anything?
Any witnesses?

09:22.295 --> 09:23.399
No, I haven't found anybody yet.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.135
We're still canvassing.
It's a pretty quiet building.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.006
Surveillance cams?
Lobby and parking garage.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.477
We're downloading it now.

09:28.534 --> 09:29.842
Who found the body?

09:29.902 --> 09:31.404
Girlfriend, Amy Lewis.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.882
She's an actress. She lives here.
She had an audition in LA.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.782
She got back around 9:00 a.
m and found him.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.445
That's her over there.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.820
She's pretty shook up.
I would be too.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.454
You sure that's him?

09:41.514 --> 09:42.959
Girlfriend lD'ed him.

09:43.015 --> 09:44.323
Says he's missing his gold Rolex.

09:44.383 --> 09:45.919
She's certain he would
have been wearing it.

09:45.985 --> 09:47.794
Said it's registered with
the insurance company.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.891
Body's completely desiccated.
That doesn't happen overnight.

09:50.957 --> 09:52.868
When was the last time
anybody saw him alive?

09:52.925 --> 09:55.030
Try last night. Yeah,
according to his girlfriend,

09:55.094 --> 09:58.132
Showalter was among the living at
an art gallery opening at 8:00 p.m.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.642
She spoke to him on his
cell phone last night.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.235
No way this guy was
alive last night.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.311
Hey, I found something.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.354
Looks like it was bitten off.

10:16.415 --> 10:18.088
Yeah, nail polish.

10:18.217 --> 10:21.596
Must be a woman's finger, but you never
know. At least we'll get a clean print.

10:25.391 --> 10:26.995
What? It moved!

10:28.127 --> 10:29.470
Must have been a nerve.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.699
You want to pick it up again

10:30.763 --> 10:32.106
or you want me to
give you the finger?

10:36.135 --> 10:37.136
That's Ryan.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.680
Could be that's the phone
call with the girlfriend.

10:39.739 --> 10:41.013
How well did you know Ryan?

10:41.073 --> 10:43.952
He bought a few pieces from me,
but I can't say that I really know him.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.212
Wait, who's the woman?

10:46.278 --> 10:49.851
I've not seen her before. I remember the
hat, but I've never seen her before.

10:49.915 --> 10:51.360
I thought this was invitation only.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.762
Yes, but we work from a list that a
number of other galleries work from.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.925
I can't say that I know
everyone on it personally.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.662
We're going to need that list.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.067
Of course.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.499
She's leaving.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.201
He's leaving, too.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.575
Could be he caught up
with her on the street.

11:08.634 --> 11:10.170
Maybe they had plans
to meet up later.

11:10.236 --> 11:11.806
And he didn't want to be
seen leaving with her.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.508
Or she didn't want to be
seen leaving with him.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.313
So who was seducing who?

11:16.142 --> 11:19.055
In my experience,
the woman runs the relationship.

11:20.146 --> 11:23.753
Well, you two seem to get all
the interesting cases lately.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.955
Not that I'm complaining.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.361
Love the challenge.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.596
Well, I can tell you
the cause of death.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.899
Your victim was made to ingest
something highly corrosive,

11:33.959 --> 11:35.131
some kind of acid.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.901
What kind? I don't know yet.

11:37.596 --> 11:41.100
But the mouth, esophagus,
and stomach lining were all eaten away.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.046
Whatever it was completely
liquefied his organs

11:44.103 --> 11:46.014
which were then sucked
out through this

11:46.072 --> 11:48.712
jagged incision
here in his abdomen.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.482
What could do that?
Some kind of embalming pump?

11:51.544 --> 11:54.491
Well, those are usually used
to pump things in, not out,

11:54.547 --> 11:56.549
but I suppose you could
switch it around.

11:56.615 --> 11:59.357
Would that explain his
overnight mummification?

11:59.452 --> 12:00.658
Oh, it might.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.461
And what about the
incision in his abdomen?

12:02.521 --> 12:03.727
Was that a knife?

12:03.789 --> 12:05.496
More like teeth.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.763
It looks something
like a bite mark.

12:08.327 --> 12:10.364
Literally sucking the victim dry.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.737
Are we looking at
a revenge killing?

12:11.797 --> 12:14.539
Don't know yet. Victim's never been married,
so we've ruled out ex-wives.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.204
Current girlfriend's
alibi checks out.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.248
Could be an ex.
He was a bit of a player.

12:18.304 --> 12:19.806
The only thing missing
was his Rolex.

12:19.872 --> 12:22.546
We've got the serial number from the
insurance company, put it on a hot list.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.815
What about his financials?
Not in debt.

12:24.877 --> 12:25.912
Doesn't seem to be a gambler,

12:25.978 --> 12:26.979
except maybe the stock market.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.525
Lots of people lost
money on the market,

12:28.581 --> 12:31.084
maybe one of his female clients
didn't appreciate his stock tip.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.322
Anybody look at our
pension funds lately?

12:32.384 --> 12:34.125
There's motive for
homicide right there.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.688
Hey, we got a hit off that finger.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.634
Same print turned up at a crime
scene in Phoenix five years ago.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.693
Phoenix PD emailed
you guys their files.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.706
Tox report's on your desk. Thanks.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.332
Let's see what we got.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.037
Well, this looks familiar.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.672
Seems like your killer's
been to Phoenix.

12:51.737 --> 12:54.047
Victim's name was
George Dixson, 25,

12:54.106 --> 12:55.847
last seen at his bachelor party.

12:55.908 --> 12:58.479
No suspects. The single
print is all they found.

12:58.544 --> 13:01.457
Only thing taken was his fiancée's
wedding ring, worth 10 grand.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.858
Could be she's collecting
trophies of her kills.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.657
A ring in Phoenix, a watch here.

13:05.718 --> 13:08.460
Looking at the tox report,
the victim was found in a mummified state

13:08.521 --> 13:09.556
just like ours.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.158
You ever hear of latroinsectotoxin?

13:11.390 --> 13:13.836
Yeah. Gargle with it every
morning. What is it?

13:13.893 --> 13:16.533
It's an amino acid
found in spider venom.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.169
Why can't she just shoot these
guys and keep it simple?

13:19.231 --> 13:20.437
Some people don't like guns.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.240
Some people don't
like spiders either.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.747
She's already killed twice,
could be more victims.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.908
See if you can find another match.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.279
Let me know. All right.

13:27.373 --> 13:29.979
Why don't you deal with Phoenix?
I'll follow the venom.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.008
"Traveling on a steamer
from Singapore,

14:28.434 --> 14:30.812
"I met a Japanese doctor
by the name of Hasegawa

14:30.870 --> 14:33.851
"who, I was surprised to discover,
shared my abilities.

14:34.506 --> 14:37.350
"He gave me the following scroll,
which described

14:37.443 --> 14:40.287
"a recent encounter with a
previously unknown creature.

14:40.346 --> 14:43.054
"I've had several passages
roughly translated."

17:01.653 --> 17:03.929
Well, if you can't hold your liquor,
you shouldn't be drinking.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.942
What do you want from me?
What are you doing here?

17:16.001 --> 17:17.877
I came here to ask
you the same thing.

17:17.935 --> 17:20.780
Why are you and your
buddies watching my house?

17:21.640 --> 17:22.675
I---

17:22.741 --> 17:24.778
Breathe! Come on, breathe!

17:24.843 --> 17:27.483
None of us have ever
seen a Grimm before.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.082
Where'd you hear about
me and where I live?

17:29.148 --> 17:31.287
Hey, doofus! Where's the beer?

17:31.350 --> 17:32.420
You.

17:33.485 --> 17:34.486
Oh, my God.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.362
Oh, my God. I have three kids.

17:36.422 --> 17:37.492
You're the one who
started all this.

17:37.556 --> 17:41.299
No, no, well, yes, sort of.
But I didn't mean anything.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.930
It's just that nobody believed me.

17:42.995 --> 17:46.067
I didn't know how else to prove you were...
You have a very lovely wife.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.439
We're not married. Even better.

17:47.499 --> 17:49.843
Please, you don't have to kill us.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.844
I'm not going to kill anyone.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.309
Really? Good. That's good.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.374
Unless they threaten
me or my girlfriend..

17:55.441 --> 17:57.421
No, no, no, we would never
do that. Never, ever.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.683
How many Wesen have
you told? Nobody.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.520
Oh, hardly anyone.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.684
You know, maybe just a
couple of neighbors...

18:02.748 --> 18:03.783
All right, here's what
you're going to do.

18:03.849 --> 18:07.228
You're going to make sure that whoever
you told and whoever they told

18:07.286 --> 18:08.959
never come to my house again.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.625
Oh, fine, sure. We can do that.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.032
We... Right? Of course!

18:12.091 --> 18:13.866
You bet! Absolutely!

18:14.193 --> 18:15.536
I hope so.

18:16.361 --> 18:17.806
Because I'd hate to have
to come back here...

18:17.863 --> 18:20.036
You won't have to do that.
Not that you're not always welcome.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.737
Anytime, anytime. Good.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.038
So we understand each other.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.726
Turndown service?

18:47.559 --> 18:49.038
Housekeeping.

19:29.034 --> 19:30.308
Same bite marks.

19:31.403 --> 19:35.749
This a piece of dress, maybe?

19:37.242 --> 19:39.586
Let's get hotel surveillance.

19:39.645 --> 19:41.921
See who we got wearing
a black dress.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.320
5'7", 120 pounds.

19:46.385 --> 19:49.298
Just like our suspect from the art gallery,
except for the blonde hair.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.028
Little black dress. Same as the
fabric we found in his hand.

19:52.090 --> 19:55.230
Just got off the phone with the chiefs
of police in Phoenix and Albuquerque.

19:55.294 --> 19:56.773
They've linked your fingerprint

19:56.828 --> 19:58.933
to two more murders in
Phoenix five years ago.

19:58.997 --> 20:02.911
Victims were found desiccated within a
three-day period, bite marks on each victim.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.380
Now, there were also three
murders with a similar MO

20:05.437 --> 20:07.383
in Albuquerque five
years before that.

20:07.472 --> 20:09.713
They were all thought to be some
sort of ritualistic killing.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.482
No suspects were ever charged.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.414
Three murders every five years.

20:13.478 --> 20:15.480
Only two victims
in Portland so far.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.992
Means the ritual is incomplete.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.156
They're also going to
send over a list of items

20:19.218 --> 20:20.856
that the killer took
from each victim.

20:20.919 --> 20:23.593
Mostly jewelry, watches, rings.

20:23.655 --> 20:25.396
Look, we want to get
ahead of this thing.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.698
We need to figure out how
she's picking her victims.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.230
She will kill again.

21:01.627 --> 21:04.130
Can I give the pretty lady a hand?

21:04.429 --> 21:07.205
Now that is a really pathetic line.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.870
Does that ever work for you?

21:08.967 --> 21:11.504
Never. But I keep trying.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.015
Today might be your
lucky day, then.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.410
I actually could use a hand.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.312
Oh. You can start with that.

21:18.377 --> 21:21.620
Ah, the heavy lifting first.

21:25.717 --> 21:27.287
Thanks, Dad.
Come on, Mom, we're late.

21:27.352 --> 21:28.660
We got to hurry.

21:30.922 --> 21:32.265
Good luck!

21:33.959 --> 21:35.996
Watch the off sides!

21:48.173 --> 21:49.618
Oh, come on in.

21:49.675 --> 21:51.814
You caught me making
some Badenwurst.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.416
I was feeling sort of homesick.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.052
My mom used to make
this stuff all the time.

21:59.284 --> 22:01.127
You want some? Who's in it?

22:01.186 --> 22:03.166
Okay. When my nana used to make it,

22:03.221 --> 22:04.791
she stuffed it with,
you know, whatever,

22:04.856 --> 22:06.130
whoever was around.

22:06.191 --> 22:08.262
Yeah, I think I'll pass.
No, but mine's vegetarian.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.603
No, I'm good. Thank you.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.633
So you wanted to talk
about spider poison?

22:14.700 --> 22:18.705
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about spider Wesen, is that right?

22:18.770 --> 22:22.479
Yeah. I don't really consider
them part of the phylum.

22:22.541 --> 22:25.681
Personally,
not a spider fan per se.

22:26.912 --> 22:30.257
I catch one, I wash it down the drain,
watch it squirm.

22:30.315 --> 22:32.317
But only if I catch
them in the house.

22:32.951 --> 22:34.726
If they're outside,
then live and let live, you know.

22:34.786 --> 22:36.459
I found a book.
There were some photos in it,

22:36.521 --> 22:38.592
but it was mostly
written in Japanese.

22:38.657 --> 22:41.604
Japanese? That's interesting.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.263
Don't expect me to
translate it, though.

22:44.329 --> 22:47.003
{ch sprechen some Deutch but that's about
it. {ch sprechen some Deutch but that's
about it.

22:47.065 --> 22:49.272
There's a whole bunch of different
kinds of spiders, you know?

22:49.334 --> 22:50.711
Some molt, some eat their young

22:50.769 --> 22:52.214
which I consider the
height of bad parenting,

22:52.270 --> 22:53.510
but as far as we're concerned,

22:53.572 --> 22:54.607
they're pretty harmless to us.

22:54.673 --> 22:59.281
Well, what about the kind that suck
the insides out of their victims?

23:01.780 --> 23:03.760
Oh, that kind of spider.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.089
You know it? Yeah.

23:06.151 --> 23:09.598
I'd say that looks like a Spinnetod.
A death spider.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.963
There's not many of them,
thank God.

23:12.023 --> 23:13.730
They're like the black
widows of their world.

23:13.792 --> 23:16.568
I really don't know much about
them except they kill after sex,

23:16.628 --> 23:19.040
which, to my way of thinking,
kind of ruins the evening.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.441
I wish I knew something
about their habits.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.673
Do they have any rituals?
I don't know.

23:23.735 --> 23:26.181
Have you searched the Web,
so to speak?

23:26.238 --> 23:29.845
Actually, wait a minute, Charlotte.

23:29.908 --> 23:30.909
Seriously.

23:30.976 --> 23:33.047
I might know someone
who can help you.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.886
Yeah, if she's still alive.

23:35.113 --> 23:37.525
And when you ran
around the outside...

23:37.582 --> 23:40.290
And kicked that goal, I thought I
was going to scream my lungs out.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.324
Too bad we lost.

23:43.388 --> 23:45.368
Honey, it doesn't matter
if you win or lose.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.631
I know, it's how you play the game.

23:47.692 --> 23:49.535
I guess we drilled that
one in pretty good.

23:51.196 --> 23:52.732
We missed you last night, Mom.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.305
I know.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.807
At least I got to see your game.

23:59.805 --> 24:03.480
And I also got your dad
something very nice.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.886
Something he's
really going to like.

24:06.344 --> 24:07.345
What is it?

24:10.315 --> 24:11.385
Wow.

24:18.156 --> 24:20.602
This is amazing. Thank you, honey.

24:22.894 --> 24:25.898
Oh, you guys are gross.
I have homework.

24:25.997 --> 24:27.567
Take your dishes. I know.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.543
I like your watch, Dad.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.680
This is too nice to wear every day.

24:37.075 --> 24:39.055
It's for special occasions.

24:40.545 --> 24:42.286
You look fantastic.

24:44.115 --> 24:45.856
I love you so much.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.273
What is this place?
It's a Klosterhaus.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.649
A retirement/monastic
retreat home for Wesen.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.845
You guys have your own rest homes?

25:11.910 --> 25:14.049
Yeah. We're not savages.

25:14.112 --> 25:15.887
Except for Schneetmachers.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.119
Noted.

25:22.888 --> 25:24.231
Charlotte?

25:25.924 --> 25:29.394
It's nice to see you again, Charlotte.
You're looking well-ish.

25:29.461 --> 25:30.940
Don't bother.

25:31.429 --> 25:33.841
I know what I look like.
I'm not blind.

25:33.899 --> 25:34.900
Yet.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.008
Come on in.

25:37.068 --> 25:41.483
This is Nick. He's a detective
and he's something else.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.848
He's a Grimm.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.954
But don't worry,
he's sort of a modified Grimm.

25:49.781 --> 25:52.557
What's he going to do to me
that time hasn't already done?

25:52.617 --> 25:54.324
I'm investigating a
string of murders

25:54.386 --> 25:56.332
and I think they
involve a Spinnetod.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.398
You're helping him? Well,
he's sort of new at this, so...

26:00.859 --> 26:04.671
I turned my back on who I was years ago,
which is why I'm here.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.231
How many victims? Two.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.300
What do they look like? Mummified.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.470
Their insides were sort of...

26:09.534 --> 26:11.070
Turned into dégueulasse?

26:12.037 --> 26:13.038
Gut butter.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.276
In a way, yes. But you're right.

26:16.541 --> 26:20.284
That's a Spinnetod.
You're sure she's killed twice?

26:20.345 --> 26:23.383
In Portland. And three in Phoenix
before that five years ago.

26:23.481 --> 26:25.358
And three in Albuquerque
five years before that.

26:25.717 --> 26:29.529
Fifteen years.
Three, three and two.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.424
Yep. That would be right.

26:33.091 --> 26:36.197
Her age would be between 28 and 32.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.765
Depending on when she first
went through le retour d'age.

26:40.398 --> 26:44.778
It's a transition, the change.
But she'll have to kill again

26:44.836 --> 26:46.907
within three days
of the last feeding

26:46.972 --> 26:49.350
to interrupt the
mortification process.

26:49.407 --> 26:50.886
Mortification process?

26:50.976 --> 26:54.788
Sounds like fun, doesn't it?
It's really quite not.

26:54.846 --> 26:56.120
So what happens if she doesn't kill

26:56.181 --> 26:57.922
and the mortification
process continues?

26:57.983 --> 26:59.462
You're looking at it.

27:00.986 --> 27:02.795
Can you guess my age?

27:04.055 --> 27:06.057
I'm 26 years old.

27:08.226 --> 27:12.436
When she told me that,
I thought she was a total whack job.

27:12.497 --> 27:13.999
I mean, I didn't
mean it in a bad way.

27:14.332 --> 27:17.279
We're plagued by a condition
that causes rapid aging.

27:17.335 --> 27:19.008
The only way to reverse it

27:19.070 --> 27:21.641
is to kill and suck the
lives out of young men.

27:21.706 --> 27:24.152
You have to understand this is
not something we want to do.

27:24.209 --> 27:26.348
We don't take pleasure from it.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.118
It tears out your heart.

27:28.179 --> 27:31.160
But no matter how much
the kills torment you,

27:31.216 --> 27:32.854
how many tears you cry,

27:33.752 --> 27:35.356
there's no stopping it.

27:35.820 --> 27:41.862
The biological imperative is
virtually impossible to resist.

27:45.530 --> 27:49.706
Was anything else taken from the
victims besides their lives?

27:50.301 --> 27:53.180
There was a Rolex watch taken
from one of the victims.

27:55.740 --> 27:58.243
We're attracted to shiny objects.

27:58.777 --> 28:02.350
I don't know why, but we are.

28:04.149 --> 28:06.527
You're not wearing any.

28:06.584 --> 28:09.497
As you can see, I've chosen a life

28:09.554 --> 28:12.160
where I won't give
in to temptation.

28:13.792 --> 28:16.534
Not that it's always been easy.

28:18.029 --> 28:22.409
You two young men look more
tantalizing by the minute.

28:23.568 --> 28:25.809
Okay. So, Nick, unless you
have any more questions...

28:25.870 --> 28:27.577
Nope. I'm good.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.277
Thank you, Charlotte.
It's lovely to see you again.

28:34.012 --> 28:36.390
She's only killed
two victims so far.

28:36.448 --> 28:39.122
And if Charlotte's right, today is the
third day of the mortification process.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.027
Sounds like she's going
to kill again, and soon.

28:41.086 --> 28:42.394
Exactly.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.026
I'm going to stay home tonight,
play a little cello.

28:50.328 --> 28:52.308
Read it to me again.

28:52.363 --> 28:53.842
That's it. We're on our way.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.071
Don't bother to sit,
we just got a hit on the Rolex watch.

28:56.134 --> 28:58.045
Where? Washington Middle School.

28:58.103 --> 28:59.878
Excuse me? The
principal just called.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.511
Ben, he's one of our
seventh graders,

29:04.576 --> 29:06.681
took it home and showed
it to his mother.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.224
She asked him where
he got it and he said

29:08.279 --> 29:10.281
he traded it for his mountain bike.

29:10.348 --> 29:13.192
She was very upset,
called the school,

29:13.251 --> 29:15.458
brought it down here and
as soon as I looked at it,

29:15.553 --> 29:17.692
I realized it was a
very expensive watch.

29:17.789 --> 29:20.599
I wanted to make sure it wasn't stolen,
so I called the police

29:20.658 --> 29:22.934
before I did anything else.
And here you are.

29:22.994 --> 29:25.133
And did Ben tell you
where he got the watch?

29:25.196 --> 29:27.938
Another student. Sally Marcinko.

29:32.837 --> 29:34.009
Sally?

29:37.408 --> 29:39.945
Hi. I'm Nick. Your name's Sally?

29:41.646 --> 29:43.284
Look, you don't have to be scared.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.194
We just want to know
where you got the watch.

29:45.750 --> 29:48.196
I... I found it.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.633
Sally, you told Ben that you
took it from your father.

30:05.937 --> 30:08.543
You've got the list.
We're looking for rings and jewelry.

30:13.044 --> 30:14.887
You catch a look at the wife?

30:22.253 --> 30:24.130
Bandage on her finger.

30:33.231 --> 30:34.574
Excuse me.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.679
How did you hurt your finger?

30:38.970 --> 30:40.574
It's not much of a story, really.

30:40.638 --> 30:42.549
We're still interested.

30:45.043 --> 30:47.387
I was making dinner while
helping with homework,

30:47.445 --> 30:49.948
while yelling at some
telemarketer never to call again

30:50.014 --> 30:53.018
and I mistook my
finger for a carrot.

30:53.751 --> 30:54.991
Can we see the cut?

30:56.788 --> 30:58.324
You're not squeamish, are you?

31:08.299 --> 31:09.835
Not so bad now.

31:12.003 --> 31:13.038
Almost healed.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.377
Any other body parts
you want to see?

31:20.578 --> 31:22.387
I told you where I got the watch.

31:22.480 --> 31:25.620
Right. A swap meet for $200.

31:25.683 --> 31:27.856
A $20,000 Rolex.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.921
The guy selling it thought
it was a knockoff.

31:29.988 --> 31:31.467
Can you hear yourself, Robert?

31:31.756 --> 31:33.531
Do you know how dumb
that story sounds?

31:33.591 --> 31:35.502
Just because you keep repeating
it doesn't make it true.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.198
But it is true.

31:37.262 --> 31:39.572
You never thought your little girl
would take that watch to school

31:39.631 --> 31:40.735
and trade it for a bike, did you?

31:40.965 --> 31:43.571
Bet your partner in crime's
really pissed at you right now.

31:43.635 --> 31:47.606
I swear to God, I have absolutely no
idea what you guys are talking about.

31:47.672 --> 31:50.016
We're talking about a woman who
killed at least eight people

31:50.074 --> 31:52.054
and that Rolex connects you to her.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.289
Now we know it's not your wife.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.959
So tell me...

32:01.019 --> 32:02.054
Who is she?

32:02.987 --> 32:05.524
I don't know anything
about any murders.

32:05.957 --> 32:07.459
Then I'm done talking to you.

32:17.302 --> 32:19.145
Rolex gives you possession
of stolen property.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.739
You can at least
charge him with that.

32:21.005 --> 32:24.885
As far as accessory to murder goes,
you got nothing.

32:26.477 --> 32:28.252
His wife's involved.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.818
I know it.

32:39.023 --> 32:40.525
I should be back by 11.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.662
Sally will be fine, Lena.
Don't worry.

32:42.727 --> 32:45.105
Okay. Tonight's about homework.

32:45.163 --> 32:47.575
You need to remember
why you're here, okay?

32:48.700 --> 32:50.111
Whatever.

33:00.445 --> 33:01.651
I got nothing on this guy.

33:01.713 --> 33:03.192
He's stonewalling and he's good.

33:04.182 --> 33:05.388
We got it. What?

33:06.351 --> 33:07.557
Something you're not
going to believe.

33:07.618 --> 33:08.824
Make me a believer.

33:08.886 --> 33:11.890
We got a hit on the wife's
print taken from the house.

33:12.190 --> 33:15.660
It's a match to the finger that we found
on the floor of Showalter's condo.

33:15.727 --> 33:16.728
What? How does that happen?

33:16.794 --> 33:18.603
The wife had all her fingers.
I don't know. I don't know.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.665
Look at it. It's an exact match.

33:20.732 --> 33:21.767
We found our killer.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.403
Well, you get to explain
this to the D.A.

33:23.501 --> 33:26.641
Oh, no, no, no. I'm going
to let her explain that.

33:27.472 --> 33:29.679
Going to take another
crack at the husband.

33:37.715 --> 33:39.388
I know about Lena.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.789
You don't know what you're
talking about. She's a Spinnetod.

33:49.093 --> 33:51.198
And now you know what I am.

33:57.702 --> 33:58.908
What do you want from me?

33:59.170 --> 34:00.911
I know she's going to kill again.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.515
Then you know I can't stop her.

34:04.742 --> 34:05.982
I don't expect you to.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.282
Where is she?

34:11.716 --> 34:13.286
I don't know.

34:14.685 --> 34:15.857
I never have.

34:16.487 --> 34:18.728
Spinnetods kill their mates.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.067
So why are you still alive?

34:23.327 --> 34:25.670
I first met Lena in high school

34:26.831 --> 34:30.870
and you can imagine she was the
most beautiful girl in school.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.574
You've seen her,
so you know what I mean.

34:34.272 --> 34:35.717
And me?

34:35.773 --> 34:37.275
I didn't stand out.

34:37.641 --> 34:40.748
We had this social
studies class together.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.159
We looked at each other
and we just knew.

34:45.116 --> 34:49.155
Talk about chemistry, or electricity,
or whatever you want to call it,

34:49.219 --> 34:50.927
but we had it from day one.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.237
And it's still the same now.

34:55.726 --> 34:58.002
You want to ask me
why she lets me live?

34:59.797 --> 35:02.801
It's because there's no life for
either of us without the other.

35:06.003 --> 35:09.644
I'm alive because she loves me.

35:52.283 --> 35:53.853
Portland PD! We're coming in!

35:53.918 --> 35:55.192
Go! Go! Go!

35:56.187 --> 35:57.188
Move! Move!

35:57.255 --> 35:59.098
Mrs. Marcinko!

36:00.191 --> 36:02.193
You guys, go downstairs!
We're going up.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.637
Got it. Let's move.

36:05.530 --> 36:06.941
Sir, hallway clear.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.044
Hank?

36:52.543 --> 36:54.022
What do you got?

36:54.078 --> 36:55.614
I don't know.

36:56.781 --> 36:58.158
Somebody want to
tell me what that is?

37:00.785 --> 37:02.287
Looks like skin.

37:02.753 --> 37:06.667
Detectives, Harbor Patrol just found
the wife's car at Riverplace Marina.

37:23.874 --> 37:25.547
I called the skip.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.817
He says we can take
her out in the morning

37:27.878 --> 37:29.323
if you'd like to.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.523
Have brunch on the river.

37:31.582 --> 37:34.188
Let's see how tonight plays out.

37:35.553 --> 37:38.033
God, you are so beautiful.

37:41.826 --> 37:43.169
What was that?

37:43.661 --> 37:45.766
It was probably just
the wake from a boat.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.767
Water scares me a little.

37:51.802 --> 37:53.440
I'll go take a look.

38:14.925 --> 38:17.371
I'm a cop. Don't talk!
Don't move. Come with me.

38:18.896 --> 38:20.637
I'm taking him off.

41:05.029 --> 41:06.099
Does my grandma know I'm coming?

41:06.197 --> 41:08.177
Yeah. We talked to her
on the phone. She knows.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.781
Is my mom okay?

41:21.245 --> 41:22.451
She wasn't hurt.

41:22.513 --> 41:25.255
Where is she? When can I see her?

41:26.350 --> 41:28.261
When can I see my dad?

41:30.054 --> 41:31.590
Maybe tomorrow.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
