04:14.547 --> 04:17.259
Yes, I know this area quite well.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.887
As I remember, Robert warned you

04:20.012 --> 04:23.974
about laying track here because
this area was prone to washouts.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.268
Robert was right.
I was wrong.

04:26.518 --> 04:27.594
Is that what you needed to hear?

04:27.719 --> 04:29.496
Well, I've said it.

04:29.621 --> 04:33.800
Now, this section needs
to be re-surveyed and re-built.

04:33.925 --> 04:34.735
Can you do it?

04:34.901 --> 04:36.335
Yes.

04:40.097 --> 04:42.243
Do you see this Ridge?

04:42.409 --> 04:43.910
This is solid bedrock.

04:44.035 --> 04:45.778
Yes, but that'll take longer.

04:45.903 --> 04:48.203
You'll have to have
your men work faster, Doc.

04:48.707 --> 04:51.850
You get paid to build 40
miles of useable road.

04:51.975 --> 04:54.463
If you build here again,
it will get washed out again.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.421
Well, it may not
rain again for months.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.467
Those are my terms.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.159
Of course, you could always find

05:01.284 --> 05:05.140
another surveyor...
Somewhere.

05:05.387 --> 05:07.555
Excuse me.

05:17.232 --> 05:18.946
Black Moon...

05:19.112 --> 05:22.378
You're gonna answer for this,
you know that.

05:22.503 --> 05:24.447
I should have let
my brother kill you.

05:24.572 --> 05:26.172
You should try right now.

05:26.786 --> 05:28.998
Hey! We've had enough
killin' for one day.

05:39.519 --> 05:42.595
I don't suppose either of
you are keen on joining me?

05:42.761 --> 05:44.305
To do what?

05:44.471 --> 05:46.225
What I came for.

05:47.327 --> 05:49.228
You'll never find them.

05:50.830 --> 05:52.501
We'll see about that.

05:52.626 --> 05:54.709
They know that you're following them.

05:54.834 --> 05:56.358
They'll kill the both of you.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.319
Yeah, we'll see about that, too.

05:59.739 --> 06:01.447
Last chance, Bohannon.

06:04.074 --> 06:06.511
I figured.

06:08.079 --> 06:10.289
What about you?

06:11.950 --> 06:14.352
You don't need his permission.

06:15.039 --> 06:17.171
He's nobody's master anymore.

06:20.192 --> 06:22.134
Go if you going.

06:34.354 --> 06:37.583
Mr. Bohannon...
You have to finish this.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.018
What are you talking about?

06:39.143 --> 06:41.236
This.
What you came to do.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.288
We came to kill the bastards
who derailed the train.

06:43.413 --> 06:44.923
We got 'em.

06:45.048 --> 06:49.620
No one's gonna believe you...
Unless you have proof.

06:49.786 --> 06:51.205
You mean scalps?

06:55.991 --> 06:58.869
They're just gonna have
to take my word for it.

06:58.994 --> 07:00.923
I ain't bringing back proof.

07:07.670 --> 07:11.558
Not even for $20 a head?

07:11.724 --> 07:13.216
Seems a shame leaving all this money

07:13.341 --> 07:17.177
lying around here for the buzzards,
don't you think?

07:18.346 --> 07:21.181
My brother belongs to me.

07:33.293 --> 07:35.291
Don't look at me.

08:48.831 --> 08:50.866
I'm a sinner, Ruth.

08:52.668 --> 08:56.237
You know that better
than anyone, don't you?

08:58.739 --> 08:59.615
Father?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.617
No.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.487
You... you let me finish.

09:04.612 --> 09:08.258
I've been wrasslin' with God, Ruth.

09:08.424 --> 09:14.306
And I honestly believe
that I was chosen for a great mission.

09:14.472 --> 09:16.655
And that's why I left.

09:19.827 --> 09:22.064
But you failed.

09:22.230 --> 09:24.539
You know, I'd like to
think that my work

09:24.664 --> 09:27.209
with John brown may
have... may have helped,

09:27.334 --> 09:29.276
in some small way,
to free the slaves.

09:29.401 --> 09:32.503
I didn't say John brown failed.

09:33.672 --> 09:36.341
I said you failed

09:39.178 --> 09:42.990
one drop of love...

09:43.115 --> 09:46.016
That's all we needed.

09:47.185 --> 09:50.597
One drop of love
would have sustained us.

09:50.722 --> 09:54.534
Now, Ruth,
I'm... I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

09:54.659 --> 09:57.391
Don't you walk away from me!

09:57.557 --> 09:58.662
Uh!

10:02.520 --> 10:03.699
Uh!

10:07.704 --> 10:09.514
Praise his name, Sister.

10:09.639 --> 10:11.780
Praise his name.

10:11.946 --> 10:13.949
Praise!

10:17.380 --> 10:20.859
The McGinnes Brothers
Magic Lantern Show.

10:20.984 --> 10:22.885
Back in business!

10:24.988 --> 10:26.898
You know what we forgot, Seano?

10:27.023 --> 10:28.547
We forgot to get a new sign.

10:28.713 --> 10:32.137
There's no more drama,
comedy, history, is there?

10:32.262 --> 10:37.664
As usual, brother, I am
3 steps ahead of you.

10:39.001 --> 10:42.246
Painter's due in an hour...

10:42.371 --> 10:44.114
With a new sign by nightfall.

10:44.239 --> 10:46.899
Nell! Nell!

10:47.065 --> 10:50.410
A word!

10:52.579 --> 10:58.202
Now that is a fine
door-ful of a woman.

11:02.756 --> 11:06.634
Nell... you know we have an agreement.

11:06.759 --> 11:09.570
Nobody's working, Swede.

11:09.695 --> 11:12.007
When nobody works, nobody gets paid.

11:12.173 --> 11:14.551
If nobody gets paid, then
nobody comes to see my...

11:15.218 --> 11:16.068
Aah!

11:16.594 --> 11:17.869
Ahh.
Son of a bitch.

11:20.932 --> 11:24.151
Now, we have an agreement.

11:28.064 --> 11:29.691
There's a better way, brother.
Aah!

11:31.150 --> 11:33.862
Straight and steady, please, sir.

11:34.028 --> 11:36.114
Yes, ma'am.

11:41.792 --> 11:45.062
Mrs. Bell, somebody's coming.

12:14.068 --> 12:16.863
Mrs. Bell.

12:17.029 --> 12:19.449
Mr. Bohannon.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.305
What you doin' out here?

12:21.430 --> 12:23.007
Surveying.

12:23.132 --> 12:26.707
I'm helping Durant
complete his 40 miles.

12:29.204 --> 12:32.254
We killed the dog soldiers
that murdered your husband.

12:37.379 --> 12:39.344
I thought you should know.

12:43.783 --> 12:46.435
So, Robert's death has been avenged.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.112
I'd hoped it would close
the hole I feel in my heart.

12:58.964 --> 13:01.950
Ain't nothin' gonna
close that up, ma'am.

13:11.044 --> 13:14.838
Ahem.
Very impressive, Mr., uh...

13:15.004 --> 13:16.715
Ferguson.
Elam Ferguson.

13:16.881 --> 13:21.152
I suppose Mr.
Bohannon sent you to collect the bounty.

13:21.427 --> 13:23.263
Bohannon ain't take them scalps.

13:23.388 --> 13:24.765
I did.

13:29.193 --> 13:34.274
I guess I owe you some money, then.

13:34.440 --> 13:40.612
Uh...$10 a scalp,
if I remember correctly.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.539
20.

13:44.826 --> 13:47.621
And if you don't mind,
I prefer them gold eagles to paper.

13:55.351 --> 13:56.922
Well...

13:58.221 --> 14:00.798
Would you like a drink?

14:00.923 --> 14:03.733
I ain't too much of a drinkin' man.

14:03.858 --> 14:07.861
Hmm. Well...
A cigar, perhaps?

14:10.199 --> 14:11.532
Thank you.

14:22.210 --> 14:24.783
Well, please... sit.

14:30.551 --> 14:34.543
You strike me as a capable man.

14:34.709 --> 14:36.765
I know which end is up.

14:36.890 --> 14:38.713
Well, that is good to know.

14:38.879 --> 14:43.438
Because I am always on
the lookout for a man

14:43.563 --> 14:47.309
willing to get his hands
dirty from time to time.

14:47.434 --> 14:50.684
A man who's willing to, uh...

14:50.850 --> 14:54.104
Do things off the books, as it were.

14:57.677 --> 15:03.864
I'm looking for a man who wants
to be feared and respected.

15:05.417 --> 15:08.118
A man trying to improve
his station in life.

16:02.859 --> 16:05.623
Oh, you slay me, honey.

16:05.995 --> 16:07.772
You really do.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.439
How's about you stay home tonight?

16:31.919 --> 16:33.796
Whatcha mean?

16:33.921 --> 16:37.757
I means... why not take a night off?

16:39.760 --> 16:43.536
Maybe take more than a night off.

16:47.016 --> 16:48.374
Are you saying...

16:48.668 --> 16:51.546
I want you to be mine.

16:51.671 --> 16:53.672
None other.

17:05.351 --> 17:06.851
Ferguson, you in there?

17:10.890 --> 17:12.940
Elam Ferguson, come on out here.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.704
You...
You son of a bitch.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.114
Mercy.

17:20.330 --> 17:23.233
On the immaculate heart
of the sweet virgin herself,

17:23.659 --> 17:25.286
I pray for mercy.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.246
And I beg you to hear me out.

17:36.479 --> 17:40.125
You shot me straight
in me gob, Mr. Ferguson.

17:40.250 --> 17:45.129
A shot that would
any man to his grave,

17:45.254 --> 17:47.999
but praise the mother's son,

17:48.124 --> 17:54.505
at the last second...
An angel reached out...

17:54.630 --> 17:59.987
And she flicked
the bullet out of me neck.

18:01.569 --> 18:03.324
I tell you, it's true.

18:03.490 --> 18:06.953
It's the reason
I kneel before you now.

18:08.609 --> 18:12.155
Let me show you.
Let me show you the hole.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.418
Please, Mr. Ferguson.

18:16.984 --> 18:20.453
Bear witness to a miracle.

18:24.624 --> 18:26.936
As I wandered in the wilderness,

18:27.061 --> 18:29.225
like our lord himself...

18:31.298 --> 18:35.148
I came face to face with me
ignorance and cruelty towards you.

18:35.401 --> 18:42.116
And I swore to God almighty
that if I survived,

18:42.241 --> 18:44.919
I would come to you on bended knee

18:45.044 --> 18:48.661
and beg for your forgiveness.

18:52.817 --> 18:53.916
Not me.

18:56.543 --> 18:58.588
Her.

19:00.881 --> 19:03.160
Come on out here.

19:14.171 --> 19:17.523
You tell her you're sorry.

19:21.044 --> 19:23.778
I'm sorry, Lass.

19:24.947 --> 19:28.200
Sorry as the sorriest sinner.

19:28.418 --> 19:31.662
I should not have harmed you such.

19:31.787 --> 19:34.123
All right, then.

19:40.295 --> 19:42.296
Go on and git.

20:05.819 --> 20:09.533
Black Moon.
Come down.

20:09.699 --> 20:11.323
It's your father.

20:16.530 --> 20:18.042
Father, you're safe.

20:18.298 --> 20:20.642
I come looking for Pawnee killer.

20:20.767 --> 20:23.269
Instead, I find a burial.

20:25.771 --> 20:28.273
Have you nothing to tell me?

20:32.811 --> 20:35.059
I came to do it myself.

20:43.588 --> 20:44.860
Go.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.399
Climb up.

20:46.524 --> 20:49.073
Let's complete the ceremony.

20:52.659 --> 20:54.578
Step right this way,
lads, and get an eyeful.

20:54.744 --> 20:57.373
See the loveliest creatures

20:57.539 --> 21:01.313
from the bluest streets of Paris,
France. Hey.

21:01.438 --> 21:04.283
See soiled doves bare all.

21:04.408 --> 21:05.484
You been gone.

21:05.609 --> 21:07.887
Took the train to Chicago.

21:08.012 --> 21:10.022
Whew, what a town.

21:10.147 --> 21:11.595
Jeez.

21:11.761 --> 21:14.392
Looks like you brought a bit
of Chicago back with you.

21:14.517 --> 21:16.517
Indeed.

21:16.683 --> 21:18.019
Do you want to take a peek?

21:26.529 --> 21:28.654
On the house, of course.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.489
Anything for Mr. Bohannon.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.744
Ah. Thanks.

21:34.910 --> 21:38.415
Hold on.

21:38.540 --> 21:41.542
Sean would like a word with you.

21:41.708 --> 21:44.688
Looks like you been
doing some business, hmm?

21:44.813 --> 21:46.622
Aye, we're packin' 'em
in like sardines.

21:46.747 --> 21:49.091
How'd you pay for the extra slides?

21:49.216 --> 21:51.093
Win another fight or somethin'?

21:53.154 --> 21:54.847
Yeah.

21:55.013 --> 22:01.562
'Course, the, uh...
The Swede will want his pound of flesh.

22:03.063 --> 22:04.565
He takes a cut?

22:04.731 --> 22:06.484
And then some.

22:06.650 --> 22:10.445
What you want me
to do about it, Sean?

22:10.570 --> 22:12.323
Here's the thing.

22:12.489 --> 22:16.994
We're not the only
ones being preyed upon.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.954
All the merchants of Hell on Wheels
are payin' him off.

22:20.079 --> 22:21.624
So...

22:21.790 --> 22:26.754
So... we took up a collection.

22:28.713 --> 22:30.164
Everybody pitched in.

22:30.289 --> 22:34.033
There's $100 in here... for you.

22:34.158 --> 22:36.889
What the hell for?

22:37.055 --> 22:39.391
For killin' the Swede.

22:43.101 --> 22:46.003
I ain't no gun for hire.

22:49.340 --> 22:51.817
All right, I tell you what...

22:51.942 --> 22:55.241
I happen to know the Swede's
been stealing from Durant.

22:55.407 --> 22:58.452
Dig you up some dirt on him,

22:58.618 --> 23:03.352
and Durant will ride him
out of town on a rail...

23:05.022 --> 23:07.336
Free.

23:45.192 --> 23:46.876
Ask me to sit down.

23:50.865 --> 23:53.700
Go on, ask me.

23:55.870 --> 23:57.845
Have a seat.

24:11.117 --> 24:15.070
Now... pour me a drink.

24:15.236 --> 24:18.255
Another glass.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.769
Your health.

24:39.591 --> 24:40.930
Tastes like shit.

24:41.096 --> 24:43.823
You ain't much of
a drinking man, is you?

24:43.948 --> 24:45.358
Gave it up.

24:45.483 --> 24:46.883
Why is that?

24:47.865 --> 24:52.650
Last time I got drunk...
I got into somethin' bad.

24:56.259 --> 25:00.997
Listen, I need to ask you somethin'.

25:04.601 --> 25:07.077
You know that bidness
we had to attend to?

25:07.202 --> 25:09.875
You good with that?

25:11.907 --> 25:14.609
I'm better than good.

25:14.963 --> 25:18.676
'Bout time I be the one
who gets to do the hurtin'.

25:18.842 --> 25:20.314
Besides...

25:21.750 --> 25:25.194
Seem Mr. Durant
took a likin' to my work.

25:25.319 --> 25:28.732
He say he might just
call on me when need be.

25:28.857 --> 25:32.802
Durant?
Better watch yourself.

25:32.927 --> 25:36.193
That's a slick slope
you're headin' down.

25:37.497 --> 25:38.974
Slick with blood.

25:39.099 --> 25:42.001
Somebody else's, for a change.

25:43.103 --> 25:44.312
For somebody who don't drink,

25:44.437 --> 25:46.537
you're putting that down pretty good.

25:56.515 --> 25:59.561
Ladies and gentlemen...

25:59.686 --> 26:03.220
Take your glasses in hand for a toast

26:03.386 --> 26:08.069
to the great Indian killers
who have made our home

26:08.194 --> 26:10.978
a safe place to work and drink!

26:23.108 --> 26:24.617
Shut up!

26:28.161 --> 26:30.331
Listen up.

26:32.649 --> 26:34.918
I want y'all to get
a good night's sleep.

26:37.420 --> 26:39.022
Tomorrow, we hit that 40-mile marker,

26:39.339 --> 26:41.623
and I'm gonna work
y'all like mongrel dogs.

26:44.260 --> 26:45.971
It's gonna get built, gentlemen.

26:47.764 --> 26:49.266
And we're just
the bastards to build it.

27:10.371 --> 27:11.372
Senator.

27:13.089 --> 27:17.735
I am glad you were able to
witness such a momentous feat.

27:17.860 --> 27:19.905
No, you're not.

27:20.030 --> 27:23.606
You're only interested
in our quid pro quo.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.610
If you insist.

27:25.735 --> 27:29.337
I had the Pinkerton track down
the Illinois man you were looking for.

27:31.240 --> 27:34.325
"Whereabouts
of Sergeant Frank Harper."

27:34.491 --> 27:38.997
Seems he's holed up at a trading
post near council bluffs.

27:40.950 --> 27:43.850
Your brother was
the runt of the litter.

27:45.186 --> 27:48.173
Smaller than all the other boys.

27:48.339 --> 27:53.036
Ah, they picked on him
and teased him.

27:53.161 --> 27:58.874
He was always in a fight,
but he never backed down.

27:58.999 --> 28:01.644
It made him strong.

28:01.810 --> 28:04.503
It made him a great warrior.

28:05.638 --> 28:08.140
But not a great man.

28:11.311 --> 28:13.121
He never learned, as you did,

28:13.246 --> 28:17.691
that... sometimes,
it's better not to fight,

28:17.816 --> 28:23.654
and other times...
You must fight the ones you love.

28:37.835 --> 28:39.766
When I saw what you were wearing...

28:39.932 --> 28:44.813
When I saw what you had
prepared for your brother,

28:44.979 --> 28:49.012
I hoped that you would return to me.

29:00.689 --> 29:02.914
But now, I see in your eyes...

29:04.360 --> 29:07.129
You are becoming your own man.

29:12.467 --> 29:18.638
And so today, I mourn for one son,
Pawnee killer.

29:22.810 --> 29:27.647
And I mourn the loss
of my other son, Black Moon...

29:34.821 --> 29:37.532
Which hurts me so much more.

30:03.724 --> 30:06.384
That's it boys, almost there!

30:07.486 --> 30:11.024
This is it right here!
This is your marker!

30:11.190 --> 30:13.776
We're gonna make it.

30:13.992 --> 30:15.153
Now put your backs into it.

30:15.319 --> 30:17.227
Pick it up, boys!

30:24.578 --> 30:27.749
I want them next two rails
laid in the next 5 minutes.

30:27.915 --> 30:29.042
Pick up the pace.

30:34.254 --> 30:38.009
We run out of flanges again,
I'll skin the runner alive!

30:38.175 --> 30:40.637
Hold the spike with
it. Hold the spike.

30:40.803 --> 30:42.889
Well, jeez!

30:43.055 --> 30:46.643
3, 2, 1.

30:46.809 --> 30:48.853
That's it, boys, almost there.

30:52.828 --> 30:54.484
Break time's over.
Back to work.

30:54.730 --> 30:57.237
Don't bloody look at it, sink!

30:59.635 --> 31:01.824
Nail crew, just get 'em nailed in!

31:01.990 --> 31:03.409
Clean-up crew, finish it.

31:03.671 --> 31:04.535
1, 2, 3!

31:04.701 --> 31:07.274
That's it.
Back into it.

31:10.207 --> 31:11.945
Almost there!

31:18.632 --> 31:21.427
You embarrass me now, boys,
and I'll skin the lot of ya.

31:21.593 --> 31:22.931
Let's go!

31:39.738 --> 31:42.407
Hold! Down.

31:56.054 --> 31:59.841
Last one, boys!
Last one.

32:19.543 --> 32:21.112
Mr. Bohannon!

32:27.049 --> 32:28.369
May I?

32:38.393 --> 32:39.714
Ahh.

32:45.567 --> 32:47.722
Ah.

32:58.857 --> 33:00.943
Congratulations.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.635
Congratulations.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.803
Congratulations.

34:04.734 --> 34:05.800
Ruth?

34:10.274 --> 34:11.976
I'm sorry.

34:12.978 --> 34:14.737
You were waiting for me?

34:15.014 --> 34:17.315
Every night.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.371
Joseph, are you hurt?

34:24.656 --> 34:26.956
No.

34:35.632 --> 34:38.301
I killed him, Ruth.

34:51.815 --> 34:54.482
I killed my own brother.

35:46.766 --> 35:47.642
Thanks.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.705
Excuse me, sir?

36:19.830 --> 36:21.241
Yeah?

36:21.366 --> 36:24.701
Oh. Pardon me, ma'am.

36:24.936 --> 36:27.313
What will you be having?

36:27.438 --> 36:30.315
Well, um...
Champagne, perhaps?

36:30.440 --> 36:32.942
Uh... ahem. What?

36:34.778 --> 36:38.131
Um... how about a glass of Sherry?

36:38.297 --> 36:39.992
I love a good Sherry.

36:40.117 --> 36:43.996
Ah. Brandy.

36:44.121 --> 36:45.163
Fine.

36:45.288 --> 36:47.498
Brandy would be fine.

36:47.623 --> 36:49.809
It's on me.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.004
May I?

36:53.129 --> 36:54.796
By all means.

36:58.801 --> 37:00.635
Thank you.

37:06.158 --> 37:07.874
Not good?

37:09.311 --> 37:13.589
Uh... I've had better.

37:13.714 --> 37:15.960
Ahh. Yeah.

37:18.152 --> 37:20.930
Well, you did it.
40 miles.

37:21.055 --> 37:23.343
You said you would, and you did.

37:23.623 --> 37:25.558
First time in my life.

37:26.560 --> 37:27.870
Failed as a tobacco farmer,

37:27.995 --> 37:29.705
lost a war...

37:29.830 --> 37:31.506
Now I'm a railroad man.

37:31.631 --> 37:34.729
Maybe third time's the charm, huh?

37:35.001 --> 37:37.732
Maybe.

37:40.239 --> 37:42.278
That first night we met, uh...

37:42.444 --> 37:46.911
You told me I had no idea who you was
or what you was capable of, and...

37:49.201 --> 37:51.124
You was right.

37:51.249 --> 37:53.957
Ha ha.

37:54.186 --> 37:57.697
I thought you were some
spoiled limey brat.

37:57.822 --> 37:58.795
Uh.

37:59.024 --> 38:02.840
Yeah, I guess I got you wrong, huh?

38:03.006 --> 38:08.031
Well, what do you think
of me now, Mr. Bohannon?

38:17.875 --> 38:20.733
Mrs. Bell!
Mr. Bohannon!

38:20.899 --> 38:22.120
Ahem.

38:22.245 --> 38:24.320
Doing a little celebrating?

38:24.486 --> 38:27.058
Well, you both deserve it.

38:27.183 --> 38:30.228
What you did today was historic.

38:30.353 --> 38:31.729
Thank you, Thomas.

38:31.854 --> 38:33.204
Will you join us?

38:33.370 --> 38:36.134
I would love to, but, um...

38:36.259 --> 38:38.602
There are a few issues outstanding

38:38.727 --> 38:40.920
that I need to discuss
with my foreman.

38:45.734 --> 38:47.568
Excuse me.

39:16.363 --> 39:18.030
Black Moon.

39:19.099 --> 39:20.675
You in here?

39:20.800 --> 39:22.701
Black Moon?

39:25.797 --> 39:28.082
You made me a pledge.

39:28.207 --> 39:33.473
You told me you would win this
war called the Union Pacific.

39:33.745 --> 39:35.589
Today, you won a major battle.

39:35.714 --> 39:37.258
You're a man of your word.

39:37.383 --> 39:39.593
Thank you, sir.

39:39.718 --> 39:44.275
I wanted to both congratulate
you and offer you a bonus.

39:44.441 --> 39:48.935
Oh. I don't need any more money, sir.

39:49.060 --> 39:52.505
It's not that kind
of bonus, Mr. Bohannon.

39:52.630 --> 39:57.789
It's much more valuable than money.

39:58.034 --> 39:59.874
Information.

40:02.084 --> 40:06.464
Oh, you... you're Lieutenant Griggs
from the Calvary.

40:06.630 --> 40:09.050
I heard about you.
Yeah?

40:09.216 --> 40:13.657
Well, I heard Black Moon
was livin' in here.

40:13.782 --> 40:16.951
You feel that Joseph led you astray?

40:18.687 --> 40:22.021
He needs to be made accountable.

40:22.258 --> 40:26.670
You know, the Swede has been,
shall we say,

40:26.795 --> 40:28.486
focused on you for some time.

40:28.731 --> 40:30.863
Like a hound got the scent.

40:33.135 --> 40:35.845
He just sent a wire

40:35.970 --> 40:39.682
to the federal marshals
in Washington, D.C.

40:39.807 --> 40:41.165
Claims he has evidence

40:41.409 --> 40:44.460
linking you to
several murders back east.

40:47.348 --> 40:48.524
You a family man, Lieutenant?

40:48.649 --> 40:53.010
Do you have a wife and children?

40:53.254 --> 40:58.158
I mean, what if...
If someone, uh...

40:58.765 --> 41:02.687
Killed your son and scalped
your daughter and raped your wife?

41:02.853 --> 41:04.856
Would you stand idly by?

41:06.606 --> 41:08.860
They'll be coming to arrest you.

41:16.209 --> 41:19.370
You telling me all this 'cause
you want me to run, Mr. Durant?

41:21.513 --> 41:25.126
I'm giving you a chance
to save yourself, Bohannon.

41:40.531 --> 41:42.308
I don't know, could you... could you...

41:42.433 --> 41:44.437
Find it in your heart to forgive him?

41:47.137 --> 41:48.399
Is he here?

41:49.972 --> 41:51.402
Not now?

41:53.743 --> 41:55.573
Sure, I'll forgive him.

41:55.812 --> 41:58.814
Right after I kill him.

42:01.662 --> 42:05.162
We're... we're all held accountable...

42:05.287 --> 42:06.584
You know, one way or another.
