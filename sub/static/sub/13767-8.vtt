WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:04.004
Did you get the eclairs?

00:04.045 --> 00:05.923
I did, but they

00:04.045 --> 00:05.923
only had three left,

00:05.965 --> 00:09.009
and I had to cut in front

00:05.965 --> 00:09.009
of an old woman to get those.

00:12.011 --> 00:14.348
Well, I just

00:12.011 --> 00:14.348
won't have one.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.183
No, no, no, no.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.183
I won't have one.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.852
You and Dewey

00:16.224 --> 00:17.852
can split one.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.979
That's not fair

00:17.893 --> 00:19.979
to Dewey.

00:20.980 --> 00:21.939
Forget it.

00:21.981 --> 00:24.149
We'll just let

00:21.981 --> 00:24.149
the boys have them.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.030

00:33.116 --> 00:34.743

01:10.153 --> 01:11.572
As near as I can figure,

01:11.613 --> 01:13.365
my school was created

01:11.613 --> 01:13.365
for the sole purpose

01:13.407 --> 01:14.909
of making me miserable.

01:14.950 --> 01:18.037
Today in Krelboyne class,

01:14.950 --> 01:18.037
we start Medieval Week.

01:20.039 --> 01:21.122
Where's your

01:20.039 --> 01:21.122
jester costume?

01:21.164 --> 01:23.124
In my backpack.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.124
I'll wear it at school.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.626
Put it on.

01:24.668 --> 01:28.047
I didn't stay up all night

01:24.668 --> 01:28.047
making it for my health.

01:32.634 --> 01:35.512
Bells-- oh, I

01:32.634 --> 01:35.512
forgot the bells.

01:35.554 --> 01:36.680
You look so adorable.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.473
You know what I love

01:36.722 --> 01:38.473
about Medieval Week?

01:38.515 --> 01:40.141
Is that you can spot

01:38.515 --> 01:40.141
the Krelboynes

01:40.183 --> 01:43.144
from super far away, and

01:40.183 --> 01:43.144
they jingle when you hit them.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.145
HAL:

01:43.186 --> 01:44.145
Reese.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.648
Leave your brother alone.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.109
Although you are asking for it.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.112
Okay, ready?

01:52.153 --> 01:53.697
Ready?

01:55.532 --> 01:57.076
Come here.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.661
Why don't you just put

01:57.117 --> 01:59.661
a bull's-eye on my chest

01:59.703 --> 02:00.829
and get it over with?

02:00.871 --> 02:02.163
Oh, you look fine.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.124
And Reese will tell me

02:02.205 --> 02:04.124
if you take these off.

02:09.004 --> 02:12.173
When I was six, I dove in a pool

02:09.004 --> 02:12.173
and my trunks came off.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.175
God, I wish I was there

02:12.215 --> 02:14.175
right now.

02:14.217 --> 02:17.178
All right, children, it's time

02:14.217 --> 02:17.178
to begin the harvest dance.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.891
I'd demonstrate myself,

02:17.220 --> 02:20.891
but being in my third trimester,

02:20.933 --> 02:22.183
I don't want to risk

02:22.225 --> 02:25.646
the placenta separating

02:22.225 --> 02:25.646
from my uterine wall.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.647
(kids groaning)

02:26.688 --> 02:28.148
Oh, come on.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.316
We studied this.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.193
There's nothing dirty

02:29.357 --> 02:32.193
about the miracle of life.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.738
And we should all be able

02:32.235 --> 02:34.738
to discuss this openly.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.197
DABNEY:

02:34.780 --> 02:36.197
Who's the father?

02:36.239 --> 02:38.575
Does he... work here?

02:38.617 --> 02:40.077
All right, you know, I told you

02:40.119 --> 02:43.080
we are not playing

02:40.119 --> 02:43.080
this game again.

02:43.122 --> 02:45.874
All right, everyone, gather

02:43.122 --> 02:45.874
their dance props, please.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.376
Dabney, don't forget

02:45.916 --> 02:48.376
you have a dentist appointment.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.134
Okay.

02:55.174 --> 02:59.220
Your Holiness, would you start

02:55.174 --> 02:59.220
the gay-- as in happy--

02:59.262 --> 03:00.722
Harvest Procession?

03:02.307 --> 03:04.726
Let's... kick it.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.022
(playing medieval tune)

03:12.275 --> 03:14.319
(bells jingling)

03:26.289 --> 03:28.834
Dabney has three dentist

03:26.289 --> 03:28.834
appointments every week.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.293
His teeth look fine to me.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.420
He's not going

03:30.335 --> 03:32.420
to the dentist.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.255
He's going to the "dentist."

03:34.297 --> 03:37.217
It's a secret code

03:34.297 --> 03:37.217
for the school therapist.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.931
How come you know that?

03:40.345 --> 03:42.931
You see the shrink, too?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.725
Yes, I'm currently

03:42.973 --> 03:44.725
seeing Ms. Gilbert.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.518
My mother and stepfather

03:44.766 --> 03:46.518
suggested it

03:46.560 --> 03:48.062
as a preemptive strike

03:48.103 --> 03:49.938
against my anger

03:48.103 --> 03:49.938
displacement tendencies.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.441
But ultimately,

03:49.980 --> 03:53.441
therapy was my decision.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.778
Not theirs... mine.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.280
It was voluntary.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.281
Okay.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.282
Yes, I am!

04:01.324 --> 04:04.244
My fear of rejection

04:01.324 --> 04:04.244
is virtually gone,

04:04.285 --> 04:07.414
and my self-worth is

04:04.285 --> 04:07.414
at an all-time high.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.291
(music ends)

04:10.333 --> 04:12.836
I really think you're going to

04:10.333 --> 04:12.836
like laundry duty, Francis.

04:12.878 --> 04:16.548
Basically, you wash it,

04:12.878 --> 04:16.548
you dry it, you fold it.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.550
You want me to go

04:16.590 --> 04:18.550
through that again?

04:18.592 --> 04:19.885
No, twice was good.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.179
Actually, I don't mind

04:19.927 --> 04:22.179
doing laundry.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.181
Mom always thought

04:22.221 --> 04:24.181
she was punishing me,

04:24.223 --> 04:27.768
but I always

04:24.223 --> 04:27.768
found it relaxing.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.310
Geez, this detergent is awful.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.355
This is way too coarse

04:29.352 --> 04:32.355
for our cotton blends.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.690
Wasn't this stuff banned?

04:33.732 --> 04:35.316
Yeah, this is what we use.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.361
You see, there is an arrangement

04:35.358 --> 04:38.361
with the distributor.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.321
We take this crappy

04:38.403 --> 04:40.321
soap off his hands,

04:40.363 --> 04:43.242
and, uh, he makes it

04:40.363 --> 04:43.242
worth our while.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.827
The Alabama Opera?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.370
There's plenty more

04:45.869 --> 04:47.370
where that came from.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.622
No thanks.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.415
Opera's not your thing.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.875
That's fine.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.794
This guy's got connections.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.880
Cords of firewood,

04:53.835 --> 04:56.880
tractor show,

04:56.922 --> 04:58.632
free burgers from Churchill's

04:56.922 --> 04:58.632
when you buy a burger

04:58.673 --> 05:00.259
of equal or greater value.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.343
Don't you think

05:00.300 --> 05:02.343
Marlin Academy is hard enough

05:02.385 --> 05:04.054
without our own guys

05:02.385 --> 05:04.054
selling us out?

05:04.096 --> 05:05.346
I mean, look at these.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.474
You ever heard

05:05.388 --> 05:07.474
of fabric softener?

05:07.515 --> 05:08.600
These sheets are like

05:08.642 --> 05:10.102
sleeping on straw.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.437
Hey, it was good enough

05:10.144 --> 05:12.437
for the baby Jesus.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.148
Get out.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.740
Where are my cooling racks?

05:23.782 --> 05:25.366
I know I put them in here.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.366
What a mess!

05:25.408 --> 05:26.409
Honey, please.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.619
I'll go to the store,

05:27.661 --> 05:28.662
and I'll buy you

05:27.661 --> 05:28.662
new cooling racks.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.080
No! I want to find these.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.915
And when I do, we are

05:30.122 --> 05:31.915
all going to clean out

05:31.957 --> 05:33.374
this disaster of a closet.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.127
It's going to be our

05:33.416 --> 05:35.127
new family project.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.171
We never finished our

05:35.169 --> 05:37.171
last family project.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.464
Because it's in here,

05:37.212 --> 05:39.464
under two tons of crap.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.887
Your dentist appointment, Lloyd?

05:45.929 --> 05:47.848
My teeth feel fine today,

05:45.929 --> 05:47.848
Caroline.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.891
I like myself.

05:50.934 --> 05:54.188
(sobbing):

05:50.934 --> 05:54.188
Oh, who am I kidding?

05:54.896 --> 05:56.397
Great news!

05:56.439 --> 06:00.527
We have been granted permission

05:56.439 --> 06:00.527
to perform the harvest dance

06:00.568 --> 06:02.403
at the all-school

06:00.568 --> 06:02.403
assembly today.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.947
(kids cheering)

06:03.989 --> 06:06.449
And fruit will be handed out

06:03.989 --> 06:06.449
to the student body

06:06.491 --> 06:08.243
in case they want to join in.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.538
Okay, everyone get

06:10.162 --> 06:11.538
in their circles,

06:11.579 --> 06:12.873
and...

06:12.914 --> 06:15.292
(music playing)

06:15.334 --> 06:17.376
(bells jingling)

06:22.216 --> 06:24.343
Sorry! Damn!

06:24.383 --> 06:25.552
Stupid!

06:25.593 --> 06:26.803
I can't do it!

06:26.845 --> 06:28.596
I'm stupid and I'm terrible!

06:28.638 --> 06:30.682
I suck at everything!

06:30.724 --> 06:32.893
And I'm fat!

06:32.934 --> 06:35.020
(gasping)

06:35.062 --> 06:37.438
(video game sound effects)

06:39.440 --> 06:40.734
Okay, you just get comfortable.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.027
We'll talk when you're ready.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.111
Thank you, Ms. Gilbert.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.988
Okay, so I faked it.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.447
But with the

06:45.030 --> 06:46.447
family I have,

06:46.489 --> 06:49.368
it would've only been a

06:46.489 --> 06:49.368
matter of time anyway.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.415
(video game sound effects)

06:59.502 --> 07:02.381
We should probably

06:59.502 --> 07:02.381
talk a little now.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.381
Do we have to?

07:02.421 --> 07:05.092
Well, that's sort of

07:02.421 --> 07:05.092
why you're here.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.469
That sucked! Where'd that

07:06.467 --> 07:08.469
flamethrower come from?

07:08.511 --> 07:09.221
Malcolm,

07:09.263 --> 07:11.348
I want you to feel relaxed here.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.934
Now, school's really stressful

07:11.390 --> 07:13.934
and can be pretty demanding.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.394
This could be...

07:15.435 --> 07:17.979
this could be a safe place

07:15.435 --> 07:17.979
for you to unwind.

07:18.021 --> 07:21.191
DABNEY:

07:18.021 --> 07:21.191
Not the face! Not the face!

07:21.233 --> 07:23.151
(punch lands, bells jingle)

07:23.193 --> 07:26.280
Could I... unwind...

07:23.193 --> 07:26.280
four or five times a week?

07:26.321 --> 07:28.573
Maybe. What would

07:26.321 --> 07:28.573
we talk about?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.158
I don't know

07:28.615 --> 07:30.158
where to begin.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.160
I really don't.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.621
Well, that was quite an episode

07:32.202 --> 07:34.621
you had in class.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.456
Did you want to talk

07:34.662 --> 07:36.456
about that?

07:36.497 --> 07:37.374
No.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.875
You'll just think it's stupid.

07:38.917 --> 07:42.503
Nothing you ever say in here

07:38.917 --> 07:42.503
will be stupid.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.798
But all I ever do

07:42.545 --> 07:44.798
is make mistakes.

07:44.839 --> 07:49.261
I feel like I don't even deserve

07:44.839 --> 07:49.261
to beat my own high score.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.512
Oh, yes, you do, Malcolm.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.806
Thank you so much.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.058
The tricky part is,

07:52.847 --> 07:55.058
I need to keep this up

07:55.100 --> 07:57.227
without being put

07:55.100 --> 07:57.227
on medication.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.022
Underpants!

07:58.061 --> 08:01.022
In a closet!

08:01.064 --> 08:03.066
Human underpants!

08:03.108 --> 08:05.526
I must not

08:03.108 --> 08:05.526
threaten you people enough!

08:05.568 --> 08:07.404
Oh, my Lord.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.780
Skittles!

08:08.822 --> 08:10.615
(laughs)

08:10.657 --> 08:14.119
You've been missing

08:10.657 --> 08:14.119
for years.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.578
You missed a

08:14.161 --> 08:15.578
great assembly.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.080
I can't believe it.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.582
They actually gave us fruit

08:17.122 --> 08:19.582
to throw at the Krelboynes.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.542
What were they thinking?

08:21.584 --> 08:24.129
Don't you ever get tired

08:21.584 --> 08:24.129
of making their lives miserable?

08:24.171 --> 08:26.840
Nope. Besides, I want them

08:24.171 --> 08:26.840
to remember who's boss.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.343
When they're living

08:26.881 --> 08:29.343
in their mansions

08:29.384 --> 08:30.593
with their

08:29.384 --> 08:30.593
supermodel wives,

08:30.635 --> 08:32.012
they're going to know--

08:32.053 --> 08:34.555
the guy cleaning their pool

08:32.053 --> 08:34.555
kicked their ass.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.556
Hey.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.600
I had six tomatoes

08:35.598 --> 08:37.600
with your name on them.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.019
Where were you?

08:39.060 --> 08:41.146
None of your business.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.439
Maybe it's Mom's business.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.815
I ditched to go

08:42.481 --> 08:43.815
to the arcade.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.732
Don't tell Mom.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.900
The arcade's closed.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.111
Not the one at the mall.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.654
Wait a minute...

08:51.614 --> 08:54.493
I  can  smell

08:51.614 --> 08:54.493
my own breath.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.580
You throw the ball

08:56.870 --> 08:59.580
around the post;

08:59.622 --> 09:03.584
it swings back and knocks

08:59.622 --> 09:03.584
down the pins, okay?

09:03.626 --> 09:04.961
I was good.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.546
I was real good.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.048
All right, now,

09:06.587 --> 09:08.048
don't be upset

09:08.089 --> 09:12.511
if the first time you

09:08.089 --> 09:12.511
throw it, nothing hap...

09:12.552 --> 09:13.636
Wow!

09:13.678 --> 09:15.972
(laughing): That was...

09:13.678 --> 09:15.972
that was a flopper!

09:16.014 --> 09:18.599
Ooh, man! Oh, man!

09:18.641 --> 09:20.643
That was, that was

09:18.641 --> 09:20.643
a lucky shot, okay?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.562
Now, the real key

09:22.603 --> 09:25.648
to Skittles is the

09:22.603 --> 09:25.648
release point, all right?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.150
When you release

09:25.690 --> 09:27.150
the ball,

09:27.192 --> 09:31.696
make sure that it goes

09:27.192 --> 09:31.696
through on a parallel...

09:32.697 --> 09:34.282
I can't believe it!

09:34.324 --> 09:36.076
This collar's so crisp,

09:34.324 --> 09:36.076
yet it doesn't chafe.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.536
And these sheets...

09:37.577 --> 09:39.079
it's like sleeping

09:37.577 --> 09:39.079
on a cloud.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.872
My pleasure, guys.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.416
Dude...

09:42.457 --> 09:43.166
thank you.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.292
I've been hoping

09:43.208 --> 09:44.292
for months

09:44.334 --> 09:46.086
that my rash was

09:44.334 --> 09:46.086
from the laundry.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.421
Turns out it was.

09:47.462 --> 09:48.171
Thanks.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.630
Glad I could help.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.174
Here, this is for you.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.551
No, Joe, you don't have to.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.552
I insist.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.635
Wow.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.263
Well, that was nice of you.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.725
Hey, would you mind tossing in

09:58.348 --> 10:00.725
some of my civilian stuff

10:00.767 --> 10:02.602
with the academy rags?

10:02.643 --> 10:05.146
Oh, I'd love to, but I'm

10:02.643 --> 10:05.146
really swamped down here.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.565
Well, yeah, whatever.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.608
Guess I could find some time

10:06.606 --> 10:08.608
for your stuff.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.404
Hey... thanks, man.

10:13.572 --> 10:14.655
No, no, no, you don't have to...

10:14.697 --> 10:15.615
You're the best.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.796
Go.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.632
Ha-cha!

10:34.008 --> 10:35.843
Garbage! In a closet!

10:35.885 --> 10:37.845
Coffee grounds? Hal!

10:37.887 --> 10:39.680
Lois, you've

10:37.887 --> 10:39.680
got to see this.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.558
The boy's a prodigy. Go.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.767
Yes.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.478
LOIS:

10:42.809 --> 10:44.478
Who are the Petersons?

10:44.519 --> 10:45.812
Why do we have

10:44.519 --> 10:45.812
their photo albums?

10:45.853 --> 10:46.729
Here we go.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.689
Now.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.067
Amazing!

10:51.109 --> 10:52.735
Hi, Malcolm.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.735
How was school?

10:52.777 --> 10:54.779
It was normal.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.239
Yeah, I'd say normal.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.740
Very medieval.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.826
Is that a truck tire?

10:59.867 --> 11:00.827
What?!

11:00.868 --> 11:03.622
Oh, my G... Hal!

11:07.125 --> 11:09.836
♪ ♪

11:35.654 --> 11:37.531
Um, Malcolm...

11:37.572 --> 11:40.741
I wanted you to know

11:37.572 --> 11:40.741
how proud I am of you.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.286
Admitting you needed help

11:40.783 --> 11:43.286
is the hardest step.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.204
No, keeping up with all

11:44.245 --> 11:46.289
the new cognitive

11:44.245 --> 11:46.289
and behavioral therapies

11:46.331 --> 11:48.249
is the hardest step, Lloyd.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.462
My self-worth is

11:50.168 --> 11:52.462
still skyrocketing.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.551
Okay, everybody...

11:57.592 --> 11:59.260
tomorrow's looming

11:57.592 --> 11:59.260
demonstration

11:59.302 --> 12:01.221
has been canceled.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.557
Instead, we will be going

12:01.262 --> 12:03.557
to see a reenactment

12:03.598 --> 12:05.266
of the slaughter

12:03.598 --> 12:05.266
of French troops

12:05.308 --> 12:06.476
at Azincourt

12:06.518 --> 12:09.229
followed by a visit to

12:06.518 --> 12:09.229
the Museum of Torture...

12:09.270 --> 12:10.104
and then pizza.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.231
Museum of Torture?

12:11.272 --> 12:12.815
That's awesome.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.442
Do they have a gift shop?

12:14.484 --> 12:16.528
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.528
You can't go.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.530
You've a dentist

12:16.570 --> 12:18.530
appointment.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.323
You're lucky

12:18.572 --> 12:20.323
you're not going.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.866
My brother

12:20.365 --> 12:21.866
went last year,

12:21.908 --> 12:24.035
and there was so

12:21.908 --> 12:24.035
much fake blood

12:24.077 --> 12:26.538
that he fainted.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.790
I think it's time I had

12:26.580 --> 12:29.790
a major breakthrough in therapy.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.669
Then a butterfly landed

12:29.832 --> 12:32.669
on my wrist and I woke up.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.546
What color was that butterfly?

12:34.588 --> 12:37.965
It was either blue or purple.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.384
Definitely not red or orange.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.594
That I can remember.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.346
Your dream, Malcolm, is so...

12:43.388 --> 12:45.306
so tranquil and soothing.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.933
This is, this is encouraging.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.268
Yeah?

12:46.974 --> 12:48.268
Mm-hmm.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.477
Yep, you're starting to relax.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.104
I think I might be, too.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.855
I need to seem cured,

12:52.897 --> 12:54.815
but to leave the door open

12:52.897 --> 12:54.815
for a relapse

12:54.857 --> 12:56.775
when we start ballet

12:54.857 --> 12:56.775
next semester.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.819
I know I'll have

12:56.817 --> 12:58.819
my ups and downs,

12:58.861 --> 13:01.573
but right now

12:58.861 --> 13:01.573
it feels good to be happy.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.199
Well, I'm glad to hear it,

13:03.241 --> 13:05.868
and I think we've made

13:03.241 --> 13:05.868
a lot of progress.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.995
Thanks, Ms. Gilbert.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.208
I like myself now.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.793
And I know I couldn't have

13:12.250 --> 13:14.793
said that on Tuesday.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.967
What are you doing here?

13:21.008 --> 13:21.968
I figured out your scam.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.094
It turns out

13:23.136 --> 13:24.929
crazy runs in the family.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.929
Reese...

13:24.971 --> 13:26.765
you don't know

13:24.971 --> 13:26.765
what you're doing.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.516
You're going to ruin everything.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.518
Relax. I've got it covered.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.729
I'm ready to see you

13:30.560 --> 13:32.729
now, Reese.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.148
(gravelly voice):

13:32.771 --> 13:35.148
Reese isn't here right now.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.816
This is Davey.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.869
That's ten in a row.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.747
Oh, Lois, he's got the gift.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.540
Since the end

13:50.789 --> 13:52.540
of the big war,

13:52.582 --> 13:55.418
there's only been one documented

13:52.582 --> 13:55.418
triple consecutive flopper

13:55.460 --> 13:56.753
in English

13:55.460 --> 13:56.753
Alley Skittles.

13:56.795 --> 13:57.836
You know what

13:56.795 --> 13:57.836
this means?

13:57.878 --> 13:59.880
I finally have

13:57.878 --> 13:59.880
something to rub in the face

13:59.922 --> 14:02.676
of that blowhard Higgins

13:59.922 --> 14:02.676
and his little tennis champion.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.135
What are you

14:02.717 --> 14:04.135
talking about?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.262
Oh, he's constantly

14:04.177 --> 14:06.262
harping about his kid

14:06.304 --> 14:07.555
winning this tournament,

14:07.597 --> 14:08.931
winning that tournament.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.224
Going to the White House.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.559
I'm taking Dewey

14:10.266 --> 14:11.559
over there

14:11.601 --> 14:13.186
to shut that guy up

14:11.601 --> 14:13.186
once and for all.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.895
Hey, you ready to

14:13.227 --> 14:14.895
shut that guy up

14:14.937 --> 14:15.938
once and for all, son?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.607
What guy?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.607
He's ready.

14:17.649 --> 14:18.899
Hal, you're

14:17.649 --> 14:18.899
just doing this

14:18.941 --> 14:20.943
to get out of

14:18.941 --> 14:20.943
cleaning out that closet.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.069
Not entirely.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.822
Let's go, son.

14:25.948 --> 14:26.907
What happened?

14:26.949 --> 14:27.908
Did you get caught?

14:27.950 --> 14:28.785
Where were you?

14:28.827 --> 14:30.370
Geez.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.370
You're always so angry.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.912
Maybe you really do

14:30.411 --> 14:31.912
need therapy.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.915
What I  need  is for you

14:31.954 --> 14:34.915
not to ruin everything for me.

14:34.957 --> 14:38.044
Do you know how much trouble

14:34.957 --> 14:38.044
we'll be in if we get caught?

14:38.085 --> 14:39.462
With Mom? With the school?

14:39.504 --> 14:40.463
With  Mom?

14:40.505 --> 14:42.215
Give me a little credit, psycho.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.924
I've been doing my own research.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.386
See, I rented

14:43.966 --> 14:46.386
Silence of the Lambs,

14:46.427 --> 14:48.805
Seven,  and  The Nutty Professor.

14:48.847 --> 14:49.972
Oh, God.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.099
Reese, tell me

14:50.014 --> 14:52.099
exactly what you told her.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.934
Nope. That's confidential.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.269
Now, which one

14:53.976 --> 14:55.269
do you like more?

14:55.311 --> 14:58.272
Hannibal Lecter

14:55.311 --> 14:58.272
or the hockey mask?

14:58.314 --> 15:00.024
(knocking)

15:02.985 --> 15:04.738
Malcolm, Reese.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.824
What do you have

15:05.988 --> 15:07.824
to say for yourselves?

15:07.866 --> 15:10.993
Don't blame Reese.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.993
Blame Davey.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.704
Ow! Ow, ow.

15:12.746 --> 15:13.872
Ow!

15:19.586 --> 15:22.463
I'm sorry it's last minute,

15:19.586 --> 15:22.463
but I need these tonight.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.841
I got another date with Rebecca.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.719
Okay...

15:27.761 --> 15:30.847
Seven items... 30 bucks.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.140
I don't have that kind of money.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.726
Last time it cost ten.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.977
You can cut me some slack,

15:34.768 --> 15:36.977
can't you?

15:37.019 --> 15:39.647
I'd love to do you

15:37.019 --> 15:39.647
a solid, Eric, but I'm booked,

15:39.689 --> 15:41.982
and it would be unethical

15:39.689 --> 15:41.982
to play favorites.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.651
You can't do this to me.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.779
I need to wear my bowling shirt.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.865
Rebecca loves

15:45.820 --> 15:48.865
my bowling shirt.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.991
Francis, I don't have the money.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.369
Well, then,

15:51.033 --> 15:53.369
you don't have the clothes.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.037
Got to pay to be a player.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.373
Look at yourself.

15:57.415 --> 16:01.335
I remember the Francis

15:57.415 --> 16:01.335
who cared about his job.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.130
A cap and a half

16:01.377 --> 16:04.130
of fabric softener, Francis.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.382
Remember that?

16:06.424 --> 16:08.885
A cap and a half!

16:08.927 --> 16:12.012
If you'll excuse me, I

16:08.927 --> 16:12.012
have some ironing to do.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.351
I can't believe him.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.562
Yeah. I had

16:17.393 --> 16:19.562
to give him three CDs

16:19.604 --> 16:22.022
just to get

16:19.604 --> 16:22.022
my dress blues pressed.

16:22.064 --> 16:25.192
I think it's time somebody

16:22.064 --> 16:25.192
taught that guy a lesson.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.487
Yeah.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.156
We'll make him wear

16:27.528 --> 16:30.156
a lame T-shirt.

16:30.197 --> 16:34.160
Or we could put it

16:30.197 --> 16:34.160
in a load of whites.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.662
Just follow me.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.960
So, my children

16:39.833 --> 16:41.960
are emotionally disturbed?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.378
Oh, we don't like

16:42.001 --> 16:44.378
to use those labels.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.506
I spent a whole week

16:44.420 --> 16:46.506
with Malcolm.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.008
Really? A whole week.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.510
Yes, and, uh...

16:50.551 --> 16:52.762
to be honest, I think,

16:50.551 --> 16:52.762
I think there are

16:52.804 --> 16:54.221
some, uh, definite issues

16:54.263 --> 16:56.808
that you and he

16:54.263 --> 16:56.808
need to talk about.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.309
Malcolm, you want to share

16:58.351 --> 16:59.978
this drawing

16:58.351 --> 16:59.978
with your mother?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.061
No, that's okay.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.194
I like what you've

17:06.108 --> 17:08.194
done with my teeth.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.320
There are

17:08.235 --> 17:09.320
some things

17:09.362 --> 17:10.738
that Malcolm told me

17:10.780 --> 17:12.114
that I think

17:10.780 --> 17:12.114
you should hear.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.075
Oh, well, I'd love

17:12.156 --> 17:15.075
to hear them.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.122
Go ahead, Malcolm.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.248
Yeah, go ahead.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.171
Everybody

17:25.378 --> 17:27.171
wants to help.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.798
You're safe here.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.055
About the

17:34.428 --> 17:36.055
anger thing?

17:36.096 --> 17:37.348
Yeah.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.059
Tell me about the anger thing.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.480
When you're angry,

17:44.522 --> 17:46.399
you bottle up your feelings

17:46.440 --> 17:49.068
and you freeze me out

17:46.440 --> 17:49.068
with silence.

17:51.029 --> 17:55.366
Well, I will, uh...

17:51.029 --> 17:55.366
I'll  try  to be more vocal.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.910
Go on.

17:56.951 --> 17:57.827
Please.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.123
I wish you would spend

17:59.913 --> 18:03.123
more time at home

18:03.165 --> 18:05.125
and less time at the...

18:05.167 --> 18:06.586
the racetrack.

18:06.627 --> 18:10.631
Well, I guess I'm going

18:06.627 --> 18:10.631
to have to change that, too.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.675
Come on, Malcolm.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.595
Tell her about

18:12.717 --> 18:15.595
the pressure.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.430
Well...

18:17.471 --> 18:19.139
I feel you put a lot

18:17.471 --> 18:19.139
of pressure on me,

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
and I can't live up

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
to your expectations.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.268
What pressure?

18:22.309 --> 18:23.519
Maybe not. I don't know.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.145
No, no, no. Go back.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.145
What were you saying?

18:25.187 --> 18:28.441
Well, you put a lot

18:25.187 --> 18:28.441
of pressure on me, and stuff.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.401
What do you mean?

18:28.482 --> 18:30.401
When do I pressure you?

18:30.443 --> 18:31.485
All the time!

18:31.527 --> 18:33.153
If it's not

18:31.527 --> 18:33.153
the extra-credit reports,

18:33.195 --> 18:35.281
it's all the advanced classes

18:33.195 --> 18:35.281
you sign me up for,

18:35.322 --> 18:36.657
and after that, I have

18:36.699 --> 18:38.534
to help Reese and Dewey

18:36.699 --> 18:38.534
with their homework.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.160
That's not pressure.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.871
You know,

18:40.202 --> 18:41.871
I didn't ask to be born smart.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.040
We just want you to live up

18:41.913 --> 18:44.040
to your potential.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.667
That.  That's exactly

18:44.082 --> 18:46.667
what I'm talking about.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.168
I tried to stop him.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.713
I said, "Hey, don't put

18:48.210 --> 18:50.713
that red T-shirt in there.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.172
That's not colorfast."

18:52.214 --> 18:53.340
But he just laughed.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.093
He said pink was a better color

18:55.134 --> 18:57.887
'cause that's what

18:55.134 --> 18:57.887
"little, weak girls wear."

18:57.929 --> 18:59.430
We've looked everywhere else.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.057
He's in here somewhere.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.683
Shh, shh!

19:16.114 --> 19:18.157
JOE:

19:16.114 --> 19:18.157
Francis?

19:19.408 --> 19:21.368
FRANCIS:

19:19.408 --> 19:21.368
No.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.536
It's okay, Dewey.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.330
Even the best of them

19:22.578 --> 19:24.330
have off-days.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.665
Uh-huh.

19:25.706 --> 19:26.916
16 misses in a row.

19:26.958 --> 19:30.252
Some people might think

19:26.958 --> 19:30.252
you did it on purpose.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.462
Huh.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.965
Hey...

19:35.049 --> 19:36.884
There something

19:35.049 --> 19:36.884
you want to tell me, son?

19:36.926 --> 19:38.719
I don't want to do this anymore.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.179
It's boring.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.931
You'd be giving up

19:41.973 --> 19:45.225
what might very well be

19:41.973 --> 19:45.225
your one true talent.

19:45.267 --> 19:49.147
You could be

19:45.267 --> 19:49.147
another Chap Sanders, hmm?

19:50.314 --> 19:53.818
Son, are you willing to turn

19:50.314 --> 19:53.818
your back on your destiny?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.695
Yeah. Can I go now?

19:55.736 --> 19:57.237
All right,

19:55.736 --> 19:57.237
if that's what you want.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.739
Wait.

19:58.781 --> 20:02.368
Can you throw it

19:58.781 --> 20:02.368
for me one more time? Hmm?

20:02.409 --> 20:05.245
One last flopper

20:02.409 --> 20:05.245
for your old dad?

20:05.287 --> 20:06.413
No.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.044
All right, then.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.294
I'm sorry.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.504
Oh, no, don't be.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.381
I'm the one

20:13.546 --> 20:15.381
who should apologize.

20:15.422 --> 20:18.509
No, you guys just want

20:15.422 --> 20:18.509
what's best for me. I know that.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.260
Oh, we do. We love you.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.846
I love you, too.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.182
(all weeping)

20:27.101 --> 20:28.019
Mom?

20:28.061 --> 20:29.269
You really pissed me off

20:29.311 --> 20:30.855
when you took away

20:29.311 --> 20:30.855
my hockey stick

20:30.897 --> 20:32.606
'cause I was hitting

20:30.897 --> 20:32.606
Dewey with it.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.193
I know you're sorry.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.237
I'll go in the attic

20:35.234 --> 20:38.237
and take it down later.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.785
Another Peterson box.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.165
Ooh. This is

20:46.787 --> 20:49.165
from the '60s.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.291
Huh. I forgot LBJ had

20:49.207 --> 20:51.291
his gall bladder out.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.668
I don't understand.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.295
Didn't we clean out this

20:52.710 --> 20:55.295
closet when we moved in?

20:55.337 --> 20:56.422
Apparently not.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.466
Oh, for crying out loud.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.260
They left an

20:59.508 --> 21:01.260
old toilet.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.313
(flushing)

21:15.441 --> 21:17.110
This is a bathroom.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.653
We have a second bathroom!

21:19.695 --> 21:21.239
Shh.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.368
If we don't tell them,

21:23.282 --> 21:26.368
they won't know.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.997
It'll just be

21:26.410 --> 21:29.997
our little secret.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.791
Our beautiful little secret.

21:31.832 --> 21:35.419
(both laughing)

21:35.461 --> 21:36.420
Here.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.880
Yeah.
