08:01.681 --> 08:03.416
where she told me
she loved me.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.617
‐ Oh, wow.
‐ I've never had a girl

08:04.651 --> 08:06.319
say that first to me
in my life,

08:06.353 --> 08:07.220
and it floored me,

08:07.253 --> 08:08.521
and it was amazing.
‐ That's so sweet.

08:08.555 --> 08:09.622
‐ So, believe it or not,
we made

08:09.656 --> 08:11.491
kind of a 12‐month plan.
‐ Oh, my God.

08:11.524 --> 08:12.492
‐ Wow.
‐ You guys already talk‐‐

08:12.525 --> 08:13.626
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah, so...

08:13.660 --> 08:14.794
I think we said in month 12

08:14.828 --> 08:16.596
we're gonna be sitting
where you guys are.

08:16.629 --> 08:17.764
‐ Yeah.
‐ Handing out a date card.

08:17.797 --> 08:18.965
And then she's going
to move Toronto.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.967
TANNER: Astrid and Kevin,
if their relationship

08:20.967 --> 08:23.503
keeps on progressing,
they could easily end up

08:23.536 --> 08:24.804
where we were
on that final day.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.473
‐ You can tell that
their relationship

08:26.506 --> 08:27.707
is already matured.
‐ Yeah.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.709
‐ And that there's love there.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.412
‐ I really like the girl,
and she's beautiful.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.847
And I just want it

08:33.880 --> 08:36.483
to slow down a little bit
because I'm...

08:36.516 --> 08:38.618
I'm not ready
for what you guys have

08:38.651 --> 08:39.753
at the current moment.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.721
‐ I think it'll take me
a little bit.

08:41.755 --> 08:42.822
I need to play catch‐up.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.457
‐ Okay.
‐ What do you think, Annaliese?

08:44.491 --> 08:45.658
‐ I mean, it scares me,
'cause, like,

08:45.692 --> 08:46.826
I do want what you guys have,

08:46.860 --> 08:49.662
but I do know
in this environment, like,

08:49.696 --> 08:52.699
literally our date was like

08:52.732 --> 08:54.634
a six‐month‐in relationship,
you know?

08:54.667 --> 08:55.735
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah.
‐ It felt like it was, like‐‐

08:55.769 --> 08:57.637
So things do change so quickly.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.639
EVAN: Annaliese is, like,
trying to support him

08:59.672 --> 09:01.775
and be like, "Yeah, I think we
should take a step back too."

09:01.808 --> 09:03.476
But she's, like, dying
in her eyes.

09:03.510 --> 09:04.677
‐ Yeah, yeah.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.413
‐ Like, she's so sad.
‐ She's like, "By step back

09:06.446 --> 09:09.182
do you mean let's get married?"

09:09.215 --> 09:10.350
‐ [inhales slowly]

09:10.383 --> 09:12.419
Bringing back memories for‐‐

09:12.452 --> 09:13.453
‐ Listen, I'm just saying,

09:13.486 --> 09:15.522
they're relatable to us.
‐ Yeah.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.724
‐ How many other girls
have you kissed here?

09:17.757 --> 09:20.326
‐ There are‐‐oh, my goodness.
‐ [laughing]

09:20.360 --> 09:21.361
‐ There are a few other girls.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.529
‐ How many are we talking here?

09:22.562 --> 09:25.331
‐ There were six others.
‐ Six others, so seven.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.433
‐ I'm seven.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.834
‐ You're like a Casanova.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.770
‐ I actually think I'm not
trying to be, either.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.739
‐ Do you see a proposal
potentially happening

09:32.772 --> 09:35.108
if the magic
of Paradise works?

09:36.309 --> 09:38.311
‐ Like, for us?

09:38.344 --> 09:39.512
‐ Yeah.
‐ Well, um,

09:39.546 --> 09:40.747
I arrived last night.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.915
‐ Oh, okay.
‐ I arrived last night.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.783
‐ So you guys are getting
engaged today?

09:43.817 --> 09:45.385
‐ Correct.
‐ [laughing] Okay.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.786
‐ So we need this date.
‐ Right.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.688
‐ So this mouse moves
with the cheese.

09:48.721 --> 09:49.956
‐ Okay.
‐ This mouse over here,

09:49.989 --> 09:52.492
the cheese is no longer there,
but it keep going back

09:52.525 --> 09:53.993
thinking the cheese
is gonna exist.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.895
‐ Are you the mouse
and is she the cheese, or what?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.697
ERIC: I'm not really
a cheese guy but‐‐

09:57.730 --> 09:59.432
‐ I can tell
you're not a cheese guy.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.601
‐ The dairy,
I'm not really into, so.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.436
‐ You're crazy.
‐ You say what?

10:03.470 --> 10:04.571
‐ I said you're crazy.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.673
‐ Well, that was [bleep] weird.
‐ [laughs]

10:06.706 --> 10:08.274
‐ I would say
we're most deserving

10:08.308 --> 10:09.943
because we're at that point

10:09.976 --> 10:12.612
where we have been falling
in love with each other

10:12.645 --> 10:13.746
and we've expressed that.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.349
And I think
something memorable

10:16.382 --> 10:18.351
outside of these
Paradise walls

10:18.384 --> 10:19.619
will help us get
to that next level.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.421
‐ Okay, cool.
‐ It'll be memorable.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.422
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.423
‐ Yeah, so‐‐[laughs]

10:23.456 --> 10:24.457
‐ Obviously I watched

10:24.491 --> 10:25.625
Krystal and Arie's season

10:25.658 --> 10:27.494
and thought she was a little
bat [bleep] crazy,

10:27.527 --> 10:28.661
not gonna lie.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.230
But...
JADE: Yes.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.464
I think they're happy.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.565
‐ There's a pair out there
for everybody.

10:32.599 --> 10:33.700
Maybe they're‐‐
‐ Maybe they're

10:33.733 --> 10:34.801
perfect for each other.
‐ Yeah.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.736
EVAN: Kendall,
if you could describe Joe

10:36.769 --> 10:39.506
as an item
in the produce department...

10:39.539 --> 10:41.474
‐ So something about him

10:41.508 --> 10:43.743
is that‐‐has to be something
that bruises easily.

10:43.776 --> 10:46.579
He's slightly‐‐has
slight hypochondria.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.714
‐ I go to the nurse every day.

10:47.747 --> 10:48.915
‐ He goes to the nurse
every day.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.817
‐ I do. I really do.
‐ He doesn't put sunscreen on.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.652
‐ I love this guy. Me too.
‐ What?

10:52.685 --> 10:54.754
Do you both, like,
want kids in life?

10:54.787 --> 10:55.889
I mean, we just had a kid.
‐ Oh, yeah, definitely.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.891
‐ Yeah, I want kids.
‐ Definitely someday.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.792
‐ Not in like‐‐
‐ You'd be the weirdest dad.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.828
‐ I don't understand
what that means.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.863
‐ You would be.
‐ How would I be a weird dad?

11:03.897 --> 11:05.565
‐ I think‐‐
‐ I'd be a fantastic father.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.568
‐ He has this thing where
he narrates what he does.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.436
So, I feel like, if you had
a kid, you'd be like,

11:10.470 --> 11:11.905
"I'm changing diapers
right now."

11:11.938 --> 11:13.573
‐ Yeah, well...
‐ "I'm feeding the baby."

11:13.606 --> 11:15.542
‐ You know what, though,
when you have a baby

11:15.575 --> 11:17.510
you talk to that baby,
like, all‐‐

11:17.544 --> 11:19.312
You're like,
"I'm changing your diaper,

11:19.345 --> 11:20.446
and now I'm wiping you."

11:20.480 --> 11:21.548
Like, that's just what you do,

11:21.581 --> 11:22.549
so you're‐‐
‐ I really like you.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.484
‐ You're starting off well.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.752
‐ I like you.

11:25.785 --> 11:28.421
EVAN: Kendall and Joe grabbed
our hearts immediately.

11:28.454 --> 11:29.489
‐ Yeah.
‐ They're sort of a little

11:29.522 --> 11:31.357
awkward together,
but that's really‐‐

11:31.391 --> 11:32.592
‐ But they admit to it.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.460
‐ It's really endearing,
and they haven't,

11:34.494 --> 11:35.595
like, figured it out.

11:35.628 --> 11:36.663
‐ Bye.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.498
‐ Bye.
‐ I really like you.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.866
‐ Ditto!
I like you guys!

11:39.899 --> 11:42.468
‐ [laughs]
‐ Go with your heart.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.636
KENDALL: I want
this date pretty bad.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.672
I think it'd be really special
to be able to have

11:45.705 --> 11:48.508
that time with Joe
and have it be a time

11:48.541 --> 11:51.945
where we can express
how we feel to each other.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.147
‐ All right, gang,
well, thank you

11:54.180 --> 11:55.615
for taking the time
to talk with all of us.

11:55.648 --> 11:56.916
We had some
very good conversations.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.353
Definitely see some potential
in at least a few couples

12:00.386 --> 12:01.654
that could form from this,
so...

12:01.688 --> 12:05.258
‐ But we thought that
the most deserving couple

12:05.291 --> 12:06.459
was Kendall and Joe.

12:06.492 --> 12:07.560
‐ Aw, yay!

12:07.594 --> 12:08.561
[applause]

12:08.595 --> 12:09.862
Wait, give them hugs.

12:09.896 --> 12:14.767
‐ So we have prepared
the most exciting...

12:14.801 --> 12:17.437
‐ Oh.
‐ Glorious...

12:17.470 --> 12:19.706
epic date...

12:19.739 --> 12:22.342
in "Bachelor in Paradise"
history.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.509
‐ Oh, goodness.
‐ Wow.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.577
‐ Wow.
‐ Most amazing.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.412
[applause]

12:26.446 --> 12:27.580
Yeah, I'm excited.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.583
‐ So, unfortunately,

12:30.617 --> 12:32.552
you both will not be going
on this date.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.720
‐ Oh.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.922
‐ We will be going on this date

12:35.955 --> 12:38.458
because we need
Mommy and Daddy breaks.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.459
‐ Yes.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.461
‐ So you both

12:41.494 --> 12:43.429
will be babysitting
our babies.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.664
ALL: Aw!

12:44.697 --> 12:46.566
[overlapping chatter]

12:46.599 --> 12:48.234

12:48.268 --> 12:50.536

12:50.570 --> 12:51.804
ANNALIESE: I think it would
have been the perfect date

12:51.838 --> 12:53.640
for me; like,
I think I would have shined.

12:53.673 --> 12:56.676
I think Joe doesn't have, like,
any experience with babies,

12:56.709 --> 12:59.612
so I feel like he's definitely
gonna be one of those guys

12:59.646 --> 13:01.614
just holding the baby
out like this like,

13:01.648 --> 13:05.351
"Ah. Take it. Take it.
I don't know what to do."

13:05.385 --> 13:06.519
‐ Joe, have you ever
held a baby?

13:06.552 --> 13:07.587
‐ Yeah, I have.
‐ Okay, good.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.721
‐ Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm good with kids.

13:08.755 --> 13:11.291
‐ Should Kendall be trusted
with anything?

13:11.324 --> 13:12.558
'Cause she loves taxidermy.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.926
She loves dead things
in her hands.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.663
‐ Kendall, Joe, make your way
over to the baby palapa

13:16.696 --> 13:18.531
and start that baby proofing.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.433

‐ So funny.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.668
[applause]
‐ Go!

13:21.701 --> 13:24.337

I would probably, uh,

13:24.370 --> 13:25.638
try to make it laugh.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.608
And I'm gonna,
and I'm good at that, so.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.709
‐ Good luck out there.
‐ Thank you.

13:29.742 --> 13:30.877
‐ You're gonna need it.
‐ [laughing]

13:30.910 --> 13:32.845
‐ I think I'm gonna be fine
with the babies.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.447
I don't think it's gonna
be a problem.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.481
I really don't.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.499
JOE: I was hoping
for a nice relaxing day

13:53.533 --> 13:57.170
with Kendall and myself,
but Evan, Carly, Jade, Tanner

13:57.203 --> 14:00.273
made their decision,
and it's babysitting.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.075
We should probably
build...a crib.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.242
‐ A crib?
‐ Right? Yeah.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.610
‐ Which is great.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.113
It's exactly what I wanted
to do today.

14:07.146 --> 14:08.281
Babysit.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.283
But I think that it's something
I can handle.

Be a man.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.220
I'm really nervous.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.456
I mean, I hold taxidermy.
I hold dead animals.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.391
That's completely different
than holding a baby.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.226
I don't know how to do this.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.561

14:23.129 --> 14:24.230

So then this is gonna
go like this.

‐ Yeah.
‐ I got it.

into finding the hole.

I think you do it yourself.

I don't know what I'm doing.

Shushanna here or not,

KAMIL: Yeah, I think

this is gonna be a lot
of baggage on this date.

to see you in Paradise.

‐ That's awesome.

1:08:14.324 --> 1:08:16.092
So I have this date card,
and would you

1:08:16.125 --> 1:08:17.894
like to go on this date?
‐ Sounds good.

1:08:17.927 --> 1:08:18.962
‐ Ah.
‐ Thank you.

1:08:18.995 --> 1:08:20.096

Were you attracted to him?

1:08:28.304 --> 1:08:31.407
SHUSHANNA: It's so unfair for
me to go on a date with him.

1:08:31.441 --> 1:08:36.145
I already went once for
the physical, you know, part.

1:08:36.179 --> 1:08:38.181

more than that.

‐ So...

1:08:39.349 --> 1:08:43.219
‐ I don't think Shushanna
understands

1:08:43.252 --> 1:08:46.255
how Paradise works
or is supposed to work

1:08:46.289 --> 1:08:49.359
because the point of Paradise
is to go on dates

1:08:49.392 --> 1:08:52.095
and then to have fun
on that date.

1:08:52.128 --> 1:08:54.097
So she goes on a date
with Kamil,

1:08:54.130 --> 1:08:55.398
she's into Kamil,

1:08:55.431 --> 1:08:58.267
but does not show him
on the date she's into Kamil.

1:08:58.301 --> 1:09:01.170
Then Shushanna gets a rose
from New Zealand Jordan,

1:09:01.204 --> 1:09:03.973
who then tries to take her
on a date,

1:09:04.007 --> 1:09:06.242
but she says,
"Oh, no, I'm good.

1:09:06.275 --> 1:09:09.278
I'll stay on this beach with
the rest of the crazy people."

1:09:09.312 --> 1:09:11.914
So Jordan takes Cassandra
on a date.

1:09:11.948 --> 1:09:13.216
So, naturally,

1:09:13.249 --> 1:09:16.285

another date by someone else,

Paradise alone?

1:22:37.119 --> 1:22:38.954
ASTRID: I love Kevin.

1:22:38.987 --> 1:22:41.190
If he asked me,
I wouldn't say no.

1:22:41.223 --> 1:22:42.391

engaged?

1:22:42.424 --> 1:22:44.760

in love with Kendall

1:22:44.793 --> 1:22:45.861

1:22:47.830 --> 1:22:49.364
to walk up to him today

1:22:49.398 --> 1:22:51.867
and have him get down
on one knee

1:22:51.900 --> 1:22:53.035
and propose.

1:22:53.068 --> 1:22:54.336
CHRIS H.: Will anyone
get married?

1:22:54.369 --> 1:22:56.104
‐ It's hard because, like,
right now,

1:22:56.138 --> 1:22:58.073
I'm just a ball of anxiousness.

1:22:58.106 --> 1:22:59.842
And that freaks me out too.

1:22:59.875 --> 1:23:00.943
CHRIS H.: And then...

to take that chance.

1:23:11.286 --> 1:23:13.956

since they left Paradise?

1:23:13.989 --> 1:23:15.958
