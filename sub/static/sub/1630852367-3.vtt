WEBVTT

00:11.261 --> 00:13.472
-Get goin', go on -Get goin', go on

00:13.555 --> 00:15.891
-Take friends along -Take friends along

00:15.974 --> 00:18.143
-Go do it all -Go do it all

00:18.227 --> 00:20.062
We all just gotta unplug

00:20.145 --> 00:22.564
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
Just like the way Doug unplugs

00:30.531 --> 00:31.532
Hi, Mop Bot.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.202
I know that knock!

00:36.119 --> 00:37.788
Doug!

00:37.871 --> 00:39.039
Emma!

00:39.122 --> 00:40.332
What are you doing here?

00:40.415 --> 00:44.586
Doug! I have come to Rebots with some big news.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.088
Guess what it is?

00:46.588 --> 00:48.507
It's hard to guess without any data.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.634
Then I'll just tell ya.

00:50.717 --> 00:54.388
Doug, since you're my best and shiniest friend,

00:54.471 --> 00:58.934
my family is inviting you to come on a vacation today with us.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.853
Really? You are?

01:00.936 --> 01:02.437
Yup, and you'll love it.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.566
My family vacations are the greatest.

01:05.649 --> 01:08.026
I have to ask my parents, but if they say yes...

01:09.444 --> 01:11.613
That's robot for, "I'm in!"

01:13.699 --> 01:17.077
I somersault in joy!

01:17.578 --> 01:19.371
Right. Pack your bag, Doug,

01:19.454 --> 01:21.623
and I'll meet you at my house soon.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.793
Vacation!

01:24.877 --> 01:27.504
Vacation!

01:28.130 --> 01:30.340
Wait! I don't know what that is.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.009
But I gotta pack!

01:33.218 --> 01:35.429
My circuits! You seem excited.

01:35.721 --> 01:39.725
That's because Emma invited me to go on a vacation with her family.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.518
Can I go, please?

01:41.602 --> 01:45.731
Well, if it's with Emma and her family, of course you can, son.

01:45.814 --> 01:46.940
Wow! Thanks!

01:47.733 --> 01:50.402
-Watering cans. Wrenches. -Tires?

01:51.278 --> 01:54.531
This human vacation seems interesting.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.867
But what do you need those twinkly lights for?

01:58.827 --> 02:01.079
I'm not sure. Emma told me to pack a bag.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.917
But I guess it's kind of hard to pack for a vacation

02:05.000 --> 02:07.586
when I don't know what a vacation actually is.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.588
Better plug in to find out.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.925
Destination vacation

02:13.008 --> 02:15.636
No chores today Don't have school

02:15.719 --> 02:17.930
Let's take a break Try something cool

02:18.013 --> 02:20.557
-Yeah -Ski a slope, cruise the sea

02:20.641 --> 02:22.726
Road trip with the family

02:23.101 --> 02:25.437
Camp outdoors Count the stars

02:25.521 --> 02:28.065
Hang out with my grandma

02:30.192 --> 02:33.987
Destination vacation Not just a normal day

02:34.071 --> 02:35.155
Hey, hey

02:35.239 --> 02:38.951
Destination vacation It's fun to get away

02:40.035 --> 02:42.913
I see. So that's what a vacation is.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.541
Only, I have a big question.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.793
Why do people go on vacation?

02:47.876 --> 02:50.838
Well, if you want to find out, Doug, you gotta unplug.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.048
And get vacationing.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.054
My special knock. Nice one.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.390
-Heya, Doug! -Hi, Emma.

03:01.473 --> 03:05.269
-Hi, Doug. -It's robo-boy. Oh, boy!

03:05.352 --> 03:06.478
It's your sisters.

03:06.562 --> 03:09.273
Hi, Tabatha and Agatha. Hi, Mr. Pine.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.485
Glad you could join us on our vacation today, Doug.

03:13.569 --> 03:16.029
Thank you, Mr. Pine. I can't wait to go.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.991
Only, why do you go on vacations?

03:19.074 --> 03:21.785
Doug! Doug, Doug, Doug.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.954
The whole point of a vacation

03:24.037 --> 03:27.708
is to go somewhere amazing and have a really great time.

03:27.791 --> 03:32.421
And today we're gonna get on an airplane and fly to this beautiful seaside town.

03:32.504 --> 03:35.883
See? We're gonna splash in the hotel pool, play mini golf...

03:35.966 --> 03:38.844
-And build sandcastles! -With sand!

03:38.927 --> 03:42.556
And ride my favorite roller coaster in the whole wide world,

03:42.639 --> 03:44.933
the Super Duper Zuper.

03:45.434 --> 03:49.438
And don't forget the beach picnic under the stars.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.023
That's my favorite part.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.275
Your mom and I never miss it.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.445
Wait. Emma, where is your mom?

03:56.528 --> 03:59.865
She's away on a business trip. She'll meet us there.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.367
Okay, gang, I think we're all packed.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.246
Or at least, I hope we are.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.664
Here we go.

04:08.457 --> 04:11.585
Vacation.

04:15.881 --> 04:20.135
No! No, no, no! Where did this weather come from?

04:20.219 --> 04:23.305
I haven't seen this much water since Rebot sprung a leak.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.933
This? This is nothing.

04:26.016 --> 04:29.269
A little rain never ruined a Pine family vacation.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.398
Okay, more like a lot of rain.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.401
But we can still go, right?

04:37.903 --> 04:40.113
Actually, Emma Bean, we can't.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.574
It looks like our flight has been canceled.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.368
-We'll have to stay home. -What?

04:44.451 --> 04:45.744
Oh, no.

05:04.054 --> 05:07.307
I'm talking to your mom, Emma Bean. She's rained in, too.

05:07.391 --> 05:10.269
Hi, sweetie. All the flights are canceled.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.020
I can't get anywhere either.

05:13.897 --> 05:17.150
Sorry, Pine family and special guest Doug.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.903
No mini golf? No roller coasters?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.990
-No sandcastles! -But I like sand.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.284
-No picnic under the stars. -No picnic under the stars.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.451
-Bye, honey. -Bye.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.494
Stay safe.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.664
And dry.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.709
Welp, I better get these bags back upstairs.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.673
Doug, if it weren't for this rain,

05:40.382 --> 05:44.011
we could be splashing in the hotel pool by now.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.054
Splashing? What's that?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.519
I see. Wait a nanosecond!

05:53.020 --> 05:54.813
Don't you have one of those, Emma?

05:55.731 --> 05:58.650
Doug, of course we have a tub.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.360
Why do you ask?

06:02.654 --> 06:05.908
Are you sure it's okay for you to be in the water, Doug?

06:05.991 --> 06:08.076
Don't worry, Dad. He's waterproof.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.287
Sometimes I even double as a fountain bot.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.998
Wow.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.501
It's kind of like we're in a real pool.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.837
Not quite.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.716
Now it feels like a real pool.

06:24.760 --> 06:25.761
No, I got it.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.388
Nope, she got it.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.895
Doug, this was a great idea.

06:35.771 --> 06:38.190
At least we got to do one thing from our trip.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.484
Maybe we can do more, Emma.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.140
Now for the most exciting thing yet...

07:12.224 --> 07:14.685
The beach picnic under the stars?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.603
The Super Duper Zuper!

07:16.687 --> 07:17.938
Wow!

07:19.648 --> 07:22.985
Ladies and gentlemen, dogs and robots,

07:23.068 --> 07:28.323
-step right up to the Super Robo Zuper! -Wow.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.076
-Wow! -It's made out of luggage!

07:31.159 --> 07:33.036
Everyone, take a suitcase.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.627
Riders, please keep your arms and legs

07:40.711 --> 07:44.798
and spare pairs of socks inside your suitcases at all times and hold on tight.

07:46.133 --> 07:50.220
Three, two, one. Robo Coaster go!

08:09.907 --> 08:12.951
You know, I think the Super Robo Zuper

08:13.035 --> 08:16.413
might be even more fun than the Super Duper Zuper.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.791
It's definitely Zupier.

08:19.875 --> 08:24.755
Plus, we did everything we were supposed to do on our Pine family vacation.

08:27.216 --> 08:29.676
Yeah, everything.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.096
Well, I'd better start cleaning up then.

08:34.765 --> 08:35.765
What's up with Dad?

08:37.142 --> 08:38.477
It doesn't compute.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.938
Did we do something to upset him, Emma?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.731
I don't think so, Doug.

08:42.813 --> 08:47.402
Dad seemed to like the pool, and the mini golf, and the coaster.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.281
The picnic under the stars!

08:51.365 --> 08:53.867
Oh, my gosh! No, no, no!

08:53.951 --> 08:55.827
No wonder Dad's upset!

08:55.911 --> 09:00.541
We forgot about his favorite part of the vacation. We gotta fix this.

09:00.624 --> 09:01.625
Yeah.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.212
But how can we picnic under the stars

09:05.295 --> 09:07.422
when we can't even see the stars?

09:08.549 --> 09:10.968
-Poor Daddy. -Daddy needs stars.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.054
Hold your microchips!

09:14.513 --> 09:17.891
I know where to get stars. I packed them in my suitcase.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.268
Good call, Doug.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.895
Wait, you did what?

09:23.272 --> 09:26.692
Dad? Could you come downstairs for a sec?

09:30.195 --> 09:31.238
Ta-da!

09:32.698 --> 09:35.909
Is this... what I think it is?

09:35.993 --> 09:39.371
Yup. It's the beach picnic for you and Mom.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.455
Hi, honey.

09:41.415 --> 09:45.002
And don't think we forgot about the stars. Doug packed them.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.853
It's perfect. Just what I wanted.

10:02.936 --> 10:08.483
Thank you, thank you, thank you, family and special guest Doug.

10:09.943 --> 10:14.031
Well, we officially did all the things from our vacation

10:14.114 --> 10:16.575
even if we aren't on a vacation.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.745
Emma, are you sure we're not on vacation?

10:20.245 --> 10:22.581
What do you mean, Doug? We're at my house.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.751
I know, but we did everything from the brochure.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.461
And had such a great time.

10:28.837 --> 10:34.009
So maybe you don't have to go anywhere to be on vacation after all.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.221
-That's right, Emma Bean. -You sure don't.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.682
So we're on a vacation even though we stayed home.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.851
We're on a staycation!

10:42.935 --> 10:43.936
Yay!

10:45.145 --> 10:47.981
And I learned vacations aren't about going places.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.275
They're about having a great time together.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.361
Come on, gang!

10:52.444 --> 10:56.907
Let's keep this staycation going and dig into this picnic.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.784
Yeah!

10:59.326 --> 11:00.911
I like picnics.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.205
What do you think, Mom and Dad?

11:03.288 --> 11:05.582
So that's a vacation.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.084
What's the purpose, son?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.877
To have a great time together.

11:08.961 --> 11:11.547
Well, I do like the sound of that.

11:12.214 --> 11:16.802
Let's go wherever it is you go to go on vacation.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.221
Actually, you don't have to go anywhere.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.932
We can have a staycation right here in Rebots.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.270
Yeah!

11:27.396 --> 11:29.565
Staycation!

11:35.028 --> 11:39.783
Wow, Dad, I've never been in the Rebots warehouse before. It's so big.

11:39.867 --> 11:43.579
It has to be, son. We reboot lots of items in our factory,

11:43.662 --> 11:47.040
and this is where we store them until we ship them to Mega City.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.709
Bob Bot, it's you.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.712
-Hi, Uncle Forkrick. -What brings you down here?

11:52.171 --> 11:55.090
Well, I need to put this bin on the blue shelves.

11:55.174 --> 11:59.344
There's just one problem. I can't find the blue shelves.

11:59.428 --> 12:05.058
I see green, yellow, a color called burnt sienna, but not blue.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.853
I could see why. Our warehouse is like a maze.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.731
So use your robo map. It'll tell you the way to go.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.649
It's like I always say,

12:12.733 --> 12:16.987
"Get anywhere in a snap with your trusty robo map."

12:18.113 --> 12:21.450
I see. And I'll be there in no time.

12:22.284 --> 12:25.954
See? It's not so hard to find your way down here, son.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.665
-Green shelves this way? -Where is the precise--

12:32.669 --> 12:35.797
-Sensors indicate ouch. -Is everybody okay?

12:35.881 --> 12:37.966
-Beep, beep, boop. -I am okay.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.595
Here you go, Mr. Bot. You dropped these. What are these?

12:41.678 --> 12:45.349
They're something humans use called hiking boots.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.101
Hiking? I've never heard of that word.

12:48.185 --> 12:51.396
Sounds like it's time for me to plug in and find out.

12:51.897 --> 12:56.068
The woods are full of wonders Crispy freshness in the air

12:56.777 --> 13:01.156
It's why I like to hike here Outdoors without a care

13:01.448 --> 13:05.577
We walk into the wild Moss, rocks, logs, and fallen leaves

13:05.953 --> 13:10.832
Watch all the little critters Make little homes among the trees

13:10.916 --> 13:14.920
Step by step We'll make it through the trail

13:15.003 --> 13:19.633
We follow winding roads Left by those here before

13:19.716 --> 13:21.176
We take a hike

13:21.260 --> 13:22.261
Yeah

13:22.636 --> 13:24.555
And find our way together

13:24.888 --> 13:29.059
Step by step We'll make it through the trail

13:29.142 --> 13:30.561
We take a hike

13:30.644 --> 13:31.645
Yeah

13:32.020 --> 13:34.481
And find our way together

13:34.565 --> 13:35.691
Nature

13:35.774 --> 13:39.820
I see. A hike is a walk through the woods.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.573
Only, I have a big question.

13:42.656 --> 13:46.243
If you're walking through the woods, how would you know which way to go?

13:46.618 --> 13:48.871
I wonder how hikers find their way.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.915
Well, I know how we'll find our way, son.

13:51.999 --> 13:55.252
Our trusty robo maps will show us where to go.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.670
They will?

13:57.296 --> 14:01.216
Wait. Dad, does this mean we're going on a hike today?

14:02.009 --> 14:03.260
I think it's time

14:03.343 --> 14:08.140
for some good old-fashioned robot-father robot-son robot bonding.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.354
Wow, this trail winds all the way up that mountain.

14:14.438 --> 14:15.981
I hope we don't get lost.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.567
We won't, son. And why?

14:18.650 --> 14:21.695
Two words, one device: robo maps.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.530
Let's get hiking.

14:26.700 --> 14:31.538
Hey, listen, the trail is covered with fallen leaves.

14:32.581 --> 14:37.711
Tiny acorns grow into these big trees? Talk about a reboot!

14:40.005 --> 14:41.340
This is called moss.

14:41.965 --> 14:45.385
I had no idea it would be so soft.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.597
These woods are amazing.

14:48.680 --> 14:52.559
I can smell the wildflowers and hear the birds chirping,

14:52.643 --> 14:53.977
a stream bubbling.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.022
Our trusty map's beeping.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.817
That bush rustling.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.278
-What do you think it is, Doug? -I'm not sure.

15:03.362 --> 15:07.824
According to my data, it could be a rabbit or raccoon or a possum or--

15:08.575 --> 15:11.620
-A big furry thing with horns? -It's called a moose.

15:11.703 --> 15:16.375
It's enor-moose. That's what it is. Run, son. Run!

15:31.849 --> 15:35.769
Doug, I have good news and terrible news.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.814
The good news, we've definitely lost that huge, scary animal

15:38.897 --> 15:41.233
that was clearly chasing us through the woods.

15:41.316 --> 15:46.154
The terrible news, I also lost the signal to my robo maps.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.781
Mine's not working either.

15:47.865 --> 15:51.410
Strange! That usually only happens in the deep woods

15:51.493 --> 15:54.830
when there's nothing but trees for as far as the robot eye can see.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.628
Dad, I checked.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.715
There's nothing but trees for as far as the robot eye can see.

16:04.798 --> 16:08.635
We must've gone further than I thought. No wonder our maps are out.

16:08.719 --> 16:12.514
Oh, no! Without them, how will we know which way to go?

16:13.473 --> 16:15.058
How will we get back home?

16:15.142 --> 16:18.478
It's okay, son. Don't set your processors to panic just yet.

16:18.562 --> 16:20.105
We're not lost.

16:20.189 --> 16:22.774
We'll just have to...

16:23.734 --> 16:26.695
retrace our steps.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.113
Great idea, Dad.

16:28.197 --> 16:33.702
Come on! I know we passed this rock and this leaf and this tree and this leaf.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.162
And that rock.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.873
-This tree. That rock. -And that leaf. This tree.

16:37.956 --> 16:42.044
And this leaf. And that rock. And this leaf.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.381
-Dad? -Yes, son?

16:47.090 --> 16:49.760
-I think we're lost. -Yes, son.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.931
But maybe we can find another way to get around the woods.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.642
I'm not sure how without our robo maps.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.894
You mean we'll never get home?

16:59.269 --> 17:02.773
Doug, my boy, my bot,

17:03.398 --> 17:06.193
this is our home now.

17:06.276 --> 17:09.070
What? We're going to live in the woods?

17:09.154 --> 17:11.698
But how will we sleep? How will we reboot?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.034
If only we could find our way.

17:14.492 --> 17:18.579
Well, until we can get home, son, we have no choice.

17:18.664 --> 17:24.461
And so, we will make a life for ourselves in the rough, wild, wild wilderness.

17:24.545 --> 17:28.423
For we are now bots of the forest!

17:48.777 --> 17:52.823
Well, I admit, while we robots may not be natural forest dwellers,

17:52.906 --> 17:55.868
we sure can build some great houses.

17:55.951 --> 17:58.120
The big leaf is even like a TV.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.581
Too bad it only gets the bug channel.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.418
Yep, yep, yep, this home is a beaut.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.462
Nothing could ever possibly knock it--

18:10.966 --> 18:15.888
No!

18:17.097 --> 18:18.682
So now what, Dad?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.100
Not sure, Doug.

18:20.184 --> 18:23.228
Our maps are out. We can't find our way home.

18:24.438 --> 18:28.942
Oops! Sorry about that. I'm Kath, and this is my friend Barb.

18:29.026 --> 18:31.403
We were just hitting our hiking groove when we heard a...

18:33.280 --> 18:36.283
-Followed by a sad... -No!

18:36.366 --> 18:39.745
-So we thought, "Hikers in need." -Hikers in need.

18:40.454 --> 18:43.498
That sounds like us. I'm Doug, and this is my dad.

18:43.582 --> 18:47.419
We're bots of the forest! Kinda.

18:47.503 --> 18:52.424
You are? I always thought most robots lived at Rebots.

18:52.508 --> 18:55.344
We used to, but then we went hiking and got lost.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.846
Well, we can show you the way.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.891
Really? Are your robo maps working?

19:00.974 --> 19:02.935
We don't have a robo map.

19:03.352 --> 19:07.314
But we can follow that yellow mark. That's called a trail blaze.

19:07.397 --> 19:10.192
It's a sign that other hikers left to mark the way.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.402
A blaze? Interesting.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.238
But what way does it say to go?

19:14.321 --> 19:16.782
Well, one blaze means go straight.

19:17.783 --> 19:22.454
Two blazes with the right one on top means go right. See?

19:22.538 --> 19:25.207
We're off and blazing now!

19:25.290 --> 19:27.876
If the top blaze is on the left, it means...

19:28.335 --> 19:30.212
-Turn left? -Correct.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.839
Turn left, everyone!

19:32.381 --> 19:34.466
We're off and blazing now.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.970
But how do we know we're going in the right direction?

19:38.053 --> 19:40.430
Well, you wanna get out of the forest, right?

19:40.514 --> 19:42.724
-Yes, please. -That's--

19:42.808 --> 19:44.393
That's probably for the best.

19:44.476 --> 19:47.312
Then we'll use this handy gadget called a compass.

19:47.396 --> 19:51.692
It has four directions on it: north, east, south, and west.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.151
North, east...

19:54.194 --> 19:57.865
You know, I use a trick to help me remember the directions.

19:57.948 --> 20:00.784
Never eat soggy waffles.

20:01.410 --> 20:04.413
North, east, south, west.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.707
I actually like soggy waffles, but it works.

20:07.875 --> 20:11.378
Now, to get outta the woods, we need to go west.

20:11.461 --> 20:14.965
The compass points north, so we walk towards the west.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.049
Try it.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.012
Which way are we walking?

20:20.095 --> 20:22.472
West. Waffles.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.186
Yeesh, it might be hard to see the blazes.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.729
It's getting kinda dark.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.106
That's not such a bad thing, Bob Bot.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.609
The sun can also tell us where we're going.

20:33.692 --> 20:37.279
-Really? -Yep, it always sets in the west.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.531
See, we're almost out of the woods.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.408
Dad,

20:41.491 --> 20:43.827
our robo maps just came back online.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.704
Fantastic!

20:46.788 --> 20:48.624
So detailed.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.752
Even I'm on that map. Hi, me.

20:51.835 --> 20:55.631
Wow, I was about to show you how the stars can guide you home,

20:55.714 --> 20:57.674
but looks like you're all set.

20:57.758 --> 21:01.762
Wait, the stars can be a map? I'd love to learn how.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.180
Please show us.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.517
Okay, let's get stargazing.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.727
If it's too dark to see your compass...

21:08.810 --> 21:11.939
And if you don't have cool light up robot maps...

21:12.022 --> 21:13.941
You can find the North Star.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.443
Is that it?

21:16.527 --> 21:20.197
Yep, right at the tip of what's called the Little Dipper.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.491
So if that's the North Star...

21:22.574 --> 21:24.993
Never eat soggy waffles.

21:25.077 --> 21:28.205
Then that way is west. Home is that way.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.623
Lead the way, son.

21:32.209 --> 21:34.294
We made it to the beginning of the trail!

21:34.378 --> 21:36.004
And the end of our hike.

21:36.088 --> 21:38.674
Thanks for helping us get back, Kath and Barb,

21:38.757 --> 21:41.635
and for teaching me you can find your way around the woods

21:41.718 --> 21:44.012
using blazes, a compass...

21:44.096 --> 21:46.056
Stars, the setting sun.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.308
As well as our robo maps.

21:48.851 --> 21:49.852
You're welcome.

21:49.935 --> 21:51.395
We had so much fun.

21:51.478 --> 21:56.275
And of course, you're both always welcome to take a hike through Rebots anytime.

21:57.568 --> 21:59.778
Of course, there are no blazes to follow.

22:00.320 --> 22:05.033
Wait. Rebots, blazes. I have an idea!

22:09.621 --> 22:12.249
Using what we've learned, we'll put blazes up.

22:12.332 --> 22:16.503
Look, Dad, now everyone in Rebots knows which way to go.

22:16.587 --> 22:20.591
Love the blazes, nephew bot. It's so much easier to get around.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.468
Gotta turn. Blue shelves to the right.

22:25.554 --> 22:30.184
Well, Dad, it's like they always say, "Every maze can use a blaze."

22:30.559 --> 22:33.353
Doug, you make me so proud.

22:35.480 --> 22:40.027
We follow winding roads Left by those here before

22:40.110 --> 22:41.695
We take a hike

22:41.778 --> 22:42.821
Yeah

22:45.449 --> 22:49.536
Step by step We'll make it through the trail

22:49.620 --> 22:51.079
We take a hike

22:51.163 --> 22:52.206
Yeah

22:54.291 --> 22:55.876
We take a hike

22:55.959 --> 22:57.002
Yeah

22:58.879 --> 23:04.301
We take a hike, yeah And find our way together
