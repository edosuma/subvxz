WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.509
- RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.
RIGHT HERE.
- OKAY.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.760
- THERE WE GO.
- NICE!

00:09.760 --> 00:11.682
-THROW AGAIN.
- KIDS, LISTEN UP.

00:11.682 --> 00:13.554
BIG NEWS.

00:13.554 --> 00:15.516
PLEASE TELL US YOU'RE NOT
HAVING ANOTHER BABY.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.598
NO, WE'RE NOT HAVING
ANOTHER BABY.

00:17.598 --> 00:20.731
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU,
WE WILL NOT BE MAKING THAT
ANNOUNCEMENT EVER AGAIN.

00:20.731 --> 00:23.354
YEAH, THIS FAMILY
IS BIG ENOUGH.

00:23.354 --> 00:25.526
HEY, YOU COMPLETELY CLEAR
ON THAT, DAD?

00:25.526 --> 00:26.987
WHY YOU POINTIN' YOUR
FINGER AT ME?

00:26.987 --> 00:28.609
HAVING BABIES IS
A TEAM EFFORT.

00:28.609 --> 00:30.411
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:31.782 --> 00:33.654
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

00:33.654 --> 00:36.707
UH...

00:36.707 --> 00:39.290
YOU KNOW WHAT? GETTING BACK
TO THAT BIG ANNOUNCEMENT--

00:39.290 --> 00:41.212
WE'RE GOING ON
A FAMILY VACATION!

00:41.212 --> 00:42.583
( all cheer )

00:42.583 --> 00:44.665
AND IT'S OUR FIRST ONE
WITH CHARLIE.

00:44.665 --> 00:46.797
AND GABE.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.300
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU'VE BEEN ON LOTS
OF VACATIONS.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.433
OKAY, VISITING GRANDMA
AFTER SHE HAD THE FAT SUCKED
OUT OF HER BUTT

00:52.433 --> 00:53.764
IS NOT A VACATION.

00:53.764 --> 00:57.808
OKAY, THIS TIME WE ARE GOING
ON A REAL VACATION

00:57.808 --> 01:00.441
TO A SKI RESORT
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

01:00.441 --> 01:02.813
OH, AND HERE'S AN INTERESTING
PIECE OF FAMILY HISTORY--

01:02.813 --> 01:04.485
THE PLACE IS CALLED
MOUNT BLISS

01:04.485 --> 01:05.896
AND IT HAPPENS TO BE--

01:05.896 --> 01:07.648
--WHERE YOUR DAD AND I
GOT MARRIED.

01:07.648 --> 01:09.490
IT'S VERY ROMANTIC.

01:09.490 --> 01:10.611
HONEY, YOU JUST
INTERRUPTED ME.

01:10.611 --> 01:12.653
I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET
TO THE POINT, BOB.

01:12.653 --> 01:15.786
YOU KNOW YOUR STORIES
GO ON FOREVER.

01:15.786 --> 01:19.039
AND THE ROMANCE CONTINUES.

01:19.039 --> 01:21.662
YOU KNOW, THE WEEKEND
WE GOT MARRIED,

01:21.662 --> 01:23.464
WE WEREN'T EVEN PLANNING
ON DOING IT.

01:23.464 --> 01:25.376
GETTING MARRIED.

01:25.376 --> 01:28.169
THEN WE MET JUDGE LAWSON
AND HE SAID WE WERE
PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER

01:28.169 --> 01:29.760
- SO WE DID IT.
- GOT MARRIED.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.713
WHY DO YOU KEEP
SAYING THAT?

01:32.713 --> 01:34.425
HAVEN'T YOU HAD
THE TALK WITH HIM YET?

01:34.425 --> 01:36.016
I HAVEN'T HAD THE TALK
WITH P.J. YET.

01:36.016 --> 01:37.808
I'M GOOD.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.925
ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T YOU KIDS
HAVE A SEAT WHILE WE CHECK IN?

02:54.925 --> 02:57.468
HEY, P.J., I HAVE TO
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

02:57.468 --> 03:00.471
- CAN YOU COME WITH ME?
OLD FOR THAT?LITTLE

03:00.471 --> 03:03.934
I PUT MY SKI PANTS
ON BACKWARDS.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.937
FIRST VACATION'S ALWAYS
THE HARDEST.

03:11.312 --> 03:13.814
WHOA.

03:13.814 --> 03:17.948
I AM GETTING A VERY POWERFUL
VIBE FROM YOU.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.582
OH SORRY. I'VE BEEN SITTING
IN A HOT MINIVAN FOR FOUR HOURS.

03:21.582 --> 03:25.286
OH, SWEETIE, NO. NO NO NO.
I MEAN I'M A PSYCHIC.

03:25.286 --> 03:28.589
- REALLY? YOU'RE A PSYCHIC?
- YEAH.

03:28.589 --> 03:31.332
'CAUSE, NO OFFENSE,
BUT YOU KIND OF LOOK LIKE
A NORMAL PERSON.

03:31.332 --> 03:33.884
DID YOU KNOW I WAS
GONNA SAY THAT?

03:33.884 --> 03:36.967
DID YOU KNOW I
WAS GONNA SAYTHAT?

03:36.967 --> 03:40.010
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

03:40.010 --> 03:42.102
AND YES, I DID.

03:42.102 --> 03:45.766
WOULD YOU LIKE
A FREE READING?

03:45.766 --> 03:47.308
YOU TELL ME.

03:47.308 --> 03:49.850
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE ANYWAY.

03:49.850 --> 03:52.112
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.

03:52.112 --> 03:54.445
OH, THIS TRIP IS GOING

03:54.445 --> 03:57.948
TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT
ONE FOR YOU.

03:57.948 --> 04:02.202
I'M SEEING YOU WILL HAVE
TWO LEFT FEET

04:02.202 --> 04:04.365
AND-- THAT'S ODD.

04:04.365 --> 04:07.167
NOW I SEE THERE IS
A BEAR IN YOUR ROOM.

04:07.167 --> 04:11.832
AND NOW I SEE WHY YOU GIVE
FREE READINGS IN THE LOBBY.

04:11.832 --> 04:14.505
AND FINALLY,

04:14.505 --> 04:17.928
I SEE YOU WILL COME
FACE TO FACE

04:17.928 --> 04:19.840
WITH THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.222
OH WHOA.
OKAY. NO THANKS.

04:22.222 --> 04:24.515
I-- I JUST GOT OUT
OF A RELATIONSHIP

04:24.515 --> 04:26.597
WITH THIS GUY
NAMED SPENCER,

04:26.597 --> 04:29.229
SO I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING
TO MEET ANYBODY.

04:29.229 --> 04:33.063
MMM. YOU THINK
IT'S UP TO YOU. THAT'S CUTE.

04:33.063 --> 04:36.897
UH, EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

04:36.897 --> 04:39.029
- TAKE WHAT?
-( phone rings )

04:40.861 --> 04:41.822
HELLO?

04:41.822 --> 04:46.206
OH, WHAT A SURPRISE.
NOT REALLY.

04:48.619 --> 04:50.871
( TV playing )

04:50.871 --> 04:53.964
COME ON, DON'T YOU WANT
TO GO SNOWBOARDING?

04:53.964 --> 04:56.507
I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW.
CHECK THIS OUT.

04:56.507 --> 04:58.509
I JUST BROKE MY NECK.

04:58.509 --> 05:00.631
SWEET.

05:00.631 --> 05:03.093
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ALL DAY?

05:03.093 --> 05:04.925
-( knock on door )
-ROOM SERVICE!

05:04.925 --> 05:06.977
DOES THAT ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION?

05:06.977 --> 05:10.561
YOUR ORDER, SIR.

05:10.561 --> 05:14.194
FRENCH FRIES, POTATO CHIPS
AND ONION RINGS A LA MODE.

05:14.194 --> 05:17.197
MR. STARKWELL?

05:17.197 --> 05:19.069
GABE.

05:21.532 --> 05:23.654
YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

05:23.654 --> 05:26.577
MR. STARKWELL WAS MY
THIRD-GRADE TEACHER.

05:26.577 --> 05:29.660
GABE IS THE REASON
I QUIT TEACHING.

05:29.660 --> 05:33.794
AND HE'S THE REASON
I WENT TO SUMMER SCHOOL.

05:33.794 --> 05:36.957
YOU WENT TO SUMMER SCHOOL
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT
A MOUTH ON YOU...

05:36.957 --> 05:38.719
SIR.

05:38.719 --> 05:40.761
HEY, REMEMBER ME?

05:40.761 --> 05:42.883
DID I HAVE YOU FOR
THIRD GRADE TOO?

05:42.883 --> 05:44.765
YEAH.

05:44.765 --> 05:47.468
WE HAD TWO GREAT
YEARS TOGETHER.

05:52.473 --> 05:56.977
WELL, LOOKS LIKE THE FOOT'S ON
THE OTHER SHOE NOW, ISN'T IT?

05:56.977 --> 06:00.781
DON'T YOU MEAN THE SHOE IS
ON THE OTHER FOOT?

06:00.781 --> 06:04.445
YOUR DAYS OF CORRECTING ME
ARE OVER, MARVIN.

06:04.445 --> 06:07.037
OH, THIS IS GONNA
BE FUN.

06:13.794 --> 06:18.048
WHAT? OH NO. I BROUGHT
TWO LEFT BOOTS BY MISTAKE.

06:19.259 --> 06:21.922
WAIT-- TWO LEFT FEET.

06:21.922 --> 06:24.765
- HUH, THAT'S WEIRD.
- WHAT'S WEIRD?

06:24.765 --> 06:27.007
WELL, I MET THIS PSYCHIC
IN THE LOBBY

06:27.007 --> 06:29.560
AND SHE MADE SOME
CRAZY PREDICTIONS.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.062
BUT ONE OF THEM JUST
KIND OF CAME TRUE.

06:32.062 --> 06:35.976
I WENT TO A PSYCHIC ONCE.
SHE WAS DEAD ON ABOUT ME,

06:37.568 --> 06:39.980
SAID I WAS GONNA
BE FAMOUS.

06:39.980 --> 06:42.983
BUT THAT HASN'T COME TRUE.

06:42.983 --> 06:44.615
YET.

06:47.027 --> 06:51.031
BUT MINE WAS CRAZY.
SHE SAID I'D COME FACE TO FACE
WITH THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

06:51.031 --> 06:52.913
WELL, IT COULD HAPPEN,
TEDDY.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.125
MOUNT BLISS IS
A MAGICAL PLACE.

06:55.125 --> 06:58.418
WELL, DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.
SHE ALSO SAID THERE WOULD BE
A BEAR IN MY ROOM.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.962
OH! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

07:05.425 --> 07:07.468
( laughs )

07:10.891 --> 07:12.683
OKAY, THAT'S JUST WEIRD.

07:12.683 --> 07:16.106
REALLY? I THOUGHT
IT WAS KINDA CUTE.

07:16.106 --> 07:20.821
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GO
TAKE IT BACK.

07:28.659 --> 07:31.782
WOW.

07:31.782 --> 07:34.495
I COULD LOOK AT
THAT VIEW FOREVER.

07:34.495 --> 07:36.627
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

07:36.627 --> 07:38.879
HMM.

07:38.879 --> 07:41.461
NEVER SEEN
THIS TRAIL BEFORE.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.963
COOL.

07:45.345 --> 07:47.548
ALL RIGHT, YEAH!

07:48.889 --> 07:52.052
AHHH!

07:53.684 --> 07:56.937
( screaming )

08:04.655 --> 08:07.317
AM I IN HEAVEN?

08:07.317 --> 08:09.530
( both giggling )

08:34.344 --> 08:36.977
- HELLO.
- HI.

08:43.193 --> 08:45.315
BYE!

08:46.406 --> 08:49.990
HEY. HEY HONEY?
GUESS WHAT?

08:49.990 --> 08:52.913
WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY MARRIED.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
GRAB SOME LUNCH?

08:52.913 --> 08:55.956
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

08:55.956 --> 08:58.368
- YOU WANT TO GRAB SOME LUNCH?
- NO, BEFORE THAT.

08:58.368 --> 09:02.422
OH, IT TURNS OUT
OUR WEDDING CEREMONY
WASN'T ACTUALLY VALID.

09:02.422 --> 09:04.585
YOU FEEL LIKE MEXICAN?

09:04.585 --> 09:08.218
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY MARRIED?

09:08.218 --> 09:11.221
WHOA WHOA, I WAS ASKING AROUND
ABOUT JUDGE LAWSON.

09:11.221 --> 09:14.094
AND THE GUY AT THE FRONT DESK
TELLS ME HE WAS LIKE SOME
KIND OF CON MAN.

09:14.094 --> 09:16.807
APPARENTLY HE DID
FAKE MARRIAGES ALL THE TIME.

09:16.807 --> 09:20.390
BUT HE SAID WE WERE
PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER.

09:20.390 --> 09:22.442
APPARENTLY IT WAS JUST
PART OF HIS SCAM.

09:22.442 --> 09:26.066
YOU KNOW, THERE'S THIS GREAT
FONDUE PLACE I READ ABOUT.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.398
WOULD YOU STOP TALKING
ABOUT FOOD?

09:28.398 --> 09:30.821
THIS IS SERIOUS. I MEAN,
WE'RE NOT REALLY MARRIED?

09:30.821 --> 09:33.864
WELL, ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSE,
OF COURSE WE ARE, HONEY.

09:33.864 --> 09:37.748
ACCORDING TO THE STATE
OF COLORADO, NOT SO MUCH.

09:41.251 --> 09:44.204
- OH HEY, PSYCHIC LADY!
- OH HI.

09:44.204 --> 09:47.878
SO I'VE BEEN LOOKING AROUND
ALL DAY FOR THE LOVE OF MY LIFE

09:47.878 --> 09:51.511
AND I HAVEN'T FOUND HIM YET.
SO WHEN'S THAT GONNA HAPPEN?

09:51.511 --> 09:53.924
OH GOSH, I DON'T KNOW.

09:53.924 --> 09:56.807
PSYCHIC PREDICTION IS NOT
AN EXACT SCIENCE.

09:56.807 --> 09:59.389
HA! IT'S NOT
A SCIENCE AT ALL.

09:59.389 --> 10:02.392
RIGHT. CAN I AT LEAST HAVE
A LITTLE MORE INFO?

10:02.392 --> 10:04.394
LIKE IS HE HOT OR NOT?

10:04.394 --> 10:08.398
NOT THAT IT MATTERS,
BUT PLEASE SAY "HOT."

10:08.398 --> 10:12.282
ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

10:12.282 --> 10:15.906
OKAY. WELL,
THEY'RE OPEN.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.869
AND THEY'RE STARTING TO SEE
THAT THIS IS A BUNCH OF--

10:18.869 --> 10:20.450
HI.

10:20.450 --> 10:21.912
HI.

10:30.010 --> 10:31.802
I'M TEDDY.

10:31.802 --> 10:33.213
I'M BRANDON.

10:33.213 --> 10:36.887
WOW. SO I GUESS
IT'S TRUE.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.258
WHAT'S TRUE?

10:38.258 --> 10:40.470
WELL, YOU--
I MEAN, US.

10:40.470 --> 10:43.103
I MEAN, I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT,
BUT THEN I HAD TWO LEFT BOOTS,

10:43.103 --> 10:45.645
WHICH AREN'T ACTUALLY FEET,
BUT THEY'RE WHERE FEET GO IN

10:45.645 --> 10:50.070
WHEN YOU NEED
SOMETHING TO WALK IN.
SO IN A SENSE, THEY'RE FEET.

10:50.070 --> 10:52.322
- WHAT?
- OKAY OKAY,

10:52.322 --> 10:54.154
I PROBABLY SOUND
A LITTLE BIT CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.237
BUT YOU WOULD TOO IF
A PSYCHIC TOLD YOU THERE
WAS A BEAR IN YOUR ROOM,

10:57.237 --> 10:59.239
WHICH THERE WAS--
SORT OF.

10:59.239 --> 11:01.541
OH, AND IN MY ROOM,
NOT IN YOUR ROOM.

11:01.541 --> 11:04.454
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT YOUR ROOM.

11:04.454 --> 11:06.626
I'M GONNA GO NOW.

11:06.626 --> 11:08.458
I'M NOT CRAZY.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.292
SERIOUSLY, I'M NOT CRAZY!

11:16.676 --> 11:21.261
FOR DINNER I WOULD LIKE
THE LOBSTER THERMOMETER.

11:21.261 --> 11:23.683
IT'S LOBSTER THERMIDOR.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.226
WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT CORRECTING ME?

11:26.226 --> 11:29.569
THAT IF I DID IT AGAIN,
YOU WERE GOING TO--

11:31.691 --> 11:34.905
WELL, I CAN'T SAY
I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

11:34.905 --> 11:37.447
NOW CHOP CHOP
AND GET ME MY LOBSTER.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.820
I KNOW THIS IS NONE
OF MY BUSINESS,

11:39.820 --> 11:42.452
BUT YOU'RE RUNNING UP
QUITE A BILL HERE.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.124
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:44.124 --> 11:47.287
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
ROOM SERVICE IS, DO YOU?

11:47.287 --> 11:50.630
YEAH. I WANT THINGS
AND YOU BRING THEM TO ME.

11:50.630 --> 11:52.753
FOR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.175
WAIT, IT COSTS MONEY?

11:55.175 --> 11:57.047
A LOT OF MONEY.

11:57.047 --> 12:00.260
SHALL WE SEE
HOW MUCH MONEY?

12:00.260 --> 12:04.304
LET'S GO TO
MY FAVORITE CHANNEL,

12:04.304 --> 12:07.347
THE BILL CHANNEL.

12:07.347 --> 12:09.229
OH MAMA!

12:09.229 --> 12:12.192
$300?!

12:12.192 --> 12:15.065
I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND
OF MONEY.

12:15.065 --> 12:18.738
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE IN
QUITE A PICKLE-- WHICH,
BY THE WAY, ARE $8.

12:20.410 --> 12:23.123
MOM AND DAD ARE GONNA
GROUND ME FOREVER.

12:23.123 --> 12:27.207
PERHAPS WE CAN MAKE
SOME KIND OF ARRANGEMENT.

12:27.207 --> 12:29.289
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:29.289 --> 12:32.042
I HAVE TO BE
A BELLMAN?

12:32.042 --> 12:33.713
BELLBOY.

12:39.219 --> 12:41.802
( slurping )

12:41.802 --> 12:44.344
( sighs )

12:44.344 --> 12:46.056
HOW'S THE COCOA?

12:46.056 --> 12:47.767
ARE YOU WARMING UP?

12:47.767 --> 12:50.981
AM I IN HEAVEN?

12:50.981 --> 12:53.273
WHY DOES HE
KEEP SAYING THAT?

12:53.273 --> 12:56.026
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT IT'S SO CUTE.

12:56.026 --> 12:59.159
SO THIS IS
YOUR CABIN, HUH?

12:59.159 --> 13:01.321
YEP.

13:01.321 --> 13:04.204
WE DON'T GET
A LOT OF VISITORS.

13:04.204 --> 13:06.997
ESPECIALLY ONES WITH
SPARKLING BLUE EYES.

13:06.997 --> 13:08.618
AND BEAUTIFUL
BLONDE HAIR.

13:08.618 --> 13:12.212
THIS IS A LUCKY DAY
FOR EVERYONE.

13:12.212 --> 13:16.176
DO YOU NEED TO CALL YOUR FAMILY
AND LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE OKAY?

13:16.176 --> 13:18.258
NAH, I'M GOOD.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.923
SO YOU GIRLS LIVE HERE ALONE?

13:22.923 --> 13:26.056
- NO, OUR PA LIVES WITH US.
- OH.

13:26.056 --> 13:29.099
- BUT HE'S AWAY ON BUSINESS.
- OH.

13:29.099 --> 13:32.432
WHY DID YOU GO DOWN
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN?

13:32.432 --> 13:36.316
BECAUSE...

13:36.316 --> 13:39.319
- DO YOU GIRLS GET T.V. HERE?
- NO.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.822
I'M TRAINING TO DEFEND
MY OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.995
WOW.

13:44.995 --> 13:46.576
THAT'S AMAZING.

13:46.576 --> 13:50.210
YOU POOR BABY,
YOU'RE FREEZING.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.623
I WANT TO RUN HIM
A HOT BATH.

13:53.623 --> 13:55.455
- I WILL.
- NO, I WILL.

13:55.455 --> 14:00.220
OH GIRLS, GIRLS.
I'M GONNA NEED MORE
THAN ONE BATH.

14:11.231 --> 14:14.104
HEY, MOM, CAN I BORROW
YOUR PINK SCARF?

14:14.104 --> 14:17.107
SURE, HONEY.
WHY ARE YOU ALL DOLLED UP?

14:17.107 --> 14:19.149
BECAUSE I THINK I MAY HAVE
MET THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.982
EXCEPT I ACTED CRAZY
AND SCARED HIM AWAY,

14:21.982 --> 14:24.284
SO NOW I HAVE TO GET
SUPER CUTE AND HANG OUT
IN THE LOBBY

14:24.284 --> 14:26.326
SO HE CAN FALL
IN LOVE WITH ME.

14:26.326 --> 14:29.910
MOM, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
HE IS THE PERFECT GUY.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.912
WELL, OKAY,
TELL ME ALL ABOUT HIM.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.794
OKAY.
WELL, HE'S REALLY CUTE.

14:34.794 --> 14:36.917
HIS NAME IS BRANDON.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.759
AND THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

14:39.759 --> 14:42.092
HE DOES SOUND PERFECT.

14:43.093 --> 14:45.095
HEY, HONEY. HEY.

14:45.095 --> 14:48.098
WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSED?
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING SKIING.

14:48.098 --> 14:51.101
NO, CHANGE OF PLANS.
THE FRONT DESK FOUND
A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

14:51.101 --> 14:53.313
WHO'S GOING TO MARRY US
THIS AFTERNOON.

14:53.313 --> 14:54.514
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:54.514 --> 14:58.979
UM, HONEY.
I WANT YOU TO BRACE YOURSELF.

14:58.979 --> 15:02.522
OKAY? YOUR FATHER AND I
AREN'T ACTUALLY MARRIED.

15:02.522 --> 15:05.445
OH MY GOSH.

15:05.445 --> 15:09.029
I FORGOT TO FLOSS.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.244
- SO SHOULD WE GO GET MARRIED?
- YEAH.

15:14.244 --> 15:16.126
BUT CAN'T IT WAIT TILL
WE GET HOME?

15:16.126 --> 15:19.799
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE REALLY ROMANTIC AND SPECIAL

15:19.799 --> 15:21.801
IF WE DID IT HERE...

15:21.801 --> 15:24.004
YOU KNOW, WHERE WE THOUGHT
WE DID IT 19 YEARS AGO.

15:24.004 --> 15:27.007
BUT I ALREADY BOUGHT
THE LIFT TICKETS.

15:27.007 --> 15:30.760
OH, COME ON, HONEY!
WE'RE ON VACATION.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.262
COME ON, I WANT
TO ENJOY MYSELF.

15:32.262 --> 15:35.225
OH OKAY.
SO BEING MARRIED TO ME

15:35.225 --> 15:37.107
ISN'T SOMETHING
YOU'D ENJOY?

15:37.107 --> 15:39.859
I'M NOT ENJOYING IT
RIGHT NOW.

15:39.859 --> 15:42.402
FINE, DON'T MARRY ME THEN.

15:42.402 --> 15:46.987
WELL, ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I WON'T.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.069
YOU WON'T LAST FIVE MINUTES
WITHOUT ME.

15:49.069 --> 15:51.871
OH YEAH?

15:51.871 --> 15:54.334
- HAVE YOU SEEN THAT--

YOUR GOLD MEDAL.

16:07.677 --> 16:10.300
WELL, IT'S GOLD

16:10.300 --> 16:14.184
AND IT'S MADE OUT OF METAL.

16:14.184 --> 16:16.186

ANYTHING ELSE?

16:16.186 --> 16:19.149
YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU GET
SOME MARSHMALLOWS,

16:19.149 --> 16:21.311
SOME CHOCOLATE AND
SOME GRAHAM CRACKERS?

16:21.311 --> 16:23.733
- WHAT FOR?

16:23.733 --> 16:26.316

16:26.316 --> 16:29.159
GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS,

16:29.159 --> 16:31.701

WHOA! WHO ARE YOU?

16:42.542 --> 16:43.923
WHO ARE YOU?

16:43.923 --> 16:45.505
I ASKED YOU FIRST.

16:45.505 --> 16:49.839
I DON'T LIKE BOYS SNIFFING
AROUND MY GIRLS.

16:49.839 --> 16:52.092
YOU MUST BE PA.

16:52.092 --> 16:55.135
WOW.

16:55.135 --> 16:58.098
YOU'RE BIGGER THAN
EVERYTHING.

16:58.098 --> 16:59.979

16:59.979 --> 17:03.193

17:39.269 --> 17:40.560
( record scratches )

17:40.560 --> 17:43.143
YEAH, IF MOMMY'S GONNA
BE SINGLE,

17:43.143 --> 17:45.605
YOU'RE GONNA BE
SINGLE TOO.

17:45.605 --> 17:49.149
HEY, HONEY, STILL LOOKING
FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE?

17:49.149 --> 17:52.322
YEAH, AND I CAN'T FIND HIM
ANYWHERE.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.905
MOM, WHAT IF I ONLY HAD
ONE CHANCE AND I BLEW IT?

17:55.905 --> 17:59.789
I'VE BEEN FEELING EXACTLY
THE SAME WAY.

17:59.789 --> 18:01.201
WHAT?

18:01.201 --> 18:04.334
BECAUSE DAD AND I AREN'T
ACTUALLY MARRIED

18:04.334 --> 18:07.667
AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO
MARRY ME AGAIN.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.420
I KNOW I'M PUTTING UP
A BRAVE FRONT,

18:10.420 --> 18:12.842
BUT I'M REALLY HURTING.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.215
OH, MAYBE THAT'S HIM!

18:20.310 --> 18:23.223
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
HOW'S IT GOING?

18:23.223 --> 18:27.147
LISTEN, IF A BIG SCARY GUY
WITH A BEARD SHOWS UP,

18:27.147 --> 18:28.898
I'M NOT HERE.

18:31.191 --> 18:33.233
( knock at door )

18:33.233 --> 18:36.075
- Gabe:ROOM SERVICE.
- YEAH, COME ON IN.

18:36.075 --> 18:39.289
HONEY, FOOD'S HERE.

18:42.292 --> 18:44.414
- WOW.
- WHAT?

18:44.414 --> 18:46.336
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE YOUNG
TO BE WORKING?

18:46.336 --> 18:48.508
I GOT MYSELF
INTO SOME TROUBLE.

18:48.508 --> 18:50.630
DID YOU KNOW THAT
ROOM SERVICE IS EXTRA?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.463
- EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.
- NOT EVERYONE, MY FRIEND.

18:55.175 --> 18:58.137
GREAT GREAT. DO YOU MIND
SETTING IT UP OVER THERE?

18:58.137 --> 19:00.430
AND IF YOU COULD
TOSS THE SALAD,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.222
MY WIFE WILL BE

19:02.222 --> 19:04.524
UH, SURE.

MY NAME IS MARVIN.

20:06.326 --> 20:09.879
I ASSURE YOU, SIR,
WHEN WE FIND THIS PERSON,
THEY'LL BE DEALT WITH SEVERELY.

20:09.879 --> 20:12.672
IMPERSONATING A BELLMAN
IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE.

20:18.097 --> 20:20.340
WELL, TIME TO GO SKIING.

20:23.343 --> 20:25.725
( piano playing )

20:36.356 --> 20:38.698

20:43.573 --> 20:47.327
I HAVEN'T BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

20:47.327 --> 20:49.248
OKAY, I SEE YOU HAVE THAT
SCARED LOOK IN YOUR EYE

20:49.248 --> 20:51.371
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY
GONNA BOLT ANY SECOND,

20:51.371 --> 20:54.083
SO BEFORE YOU DO THAT,

20:54.083 --> 20:55.965
CAN WE JUST START OVER?

20:55.965 --> 20:57.507
SURE.

20:57.507 --> 21:02.221
HEY, WHY DON'T I GRAB US
SOME HOT COCOA

21:02.221 --> 21:04.884
AND YOU FIND US
SOMEWHERE TO SIT?

21:04.884 --> 21:07.186

21:10.350 --> 21:13.272

HI.

21:15.234 --> 21:19.238

21:19.238 --> 21:21.401
YEAH. YEAH, WE ARE.

21:21.401 --> 21:26.075
BUT I ALREADY WAS FACE TO FACE.
I CAN'T BE FACE TO FACE TO FACE.

21:26.075 --> 21:27.997
WAIT, WHAT?

21:27.997 --> 21:32.171
WELL, YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE HIM, BUT NOW I
GUESS IT COULD BE YOU.

21:32.171 --> 21:34.414
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I NEED TO TALK TO MY PSYCHIC.

21:34.414 --> 21:37.377
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
SORRY.

21:37.377 --> 21:40.970
TEDDY.

21:40.970 --> 21:43.092
SPENCER.

21:48.227 --> 21:50.350
P.J.:NEXT TIME ON
"GOOD LUCK CHARLIE"...

21:50.350 --> 21:52.021
WHERE ARE WE GOING

21:52.021 --> 21:54.143
THIS IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE TO SIGN UP

21:54.143 --> 21:56.646
FOR THE ICE-DANCING
CONTEST.

21:56.646 --> 21:58.988
GRAND PRIZE-- $500.

21:58.988 --> 22:01.240
WE'LL BE LUCKY
TO FINISH SECOND.

22:01.240 --> 22:04.784
- THERE ARE ONLY TWO TEAMS.
- SO YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME.

22:07.246 --> 22:08.868
AH!

22:08.868 --> 22:10.660
WHY DO I HAVE A NEW ROOM?

22:10.660 --> 22:13.122
BECAUSE YOU AND I ARE
NOT LEGALLY MARRIED.

22:13.122 --> 22:16.255
AND SINCE IT WOULD
YOU TO MARRY ME AGAIN,CE

22:16.255 --> 22:18.337
YOU'LL BE LODGING ELSEWHERE.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.720
SHE SAID I'D COME
OF MY LIFE ON THIS TRIP.VE

22:20.720 --> 22:24.924
AND SO FAR I'VE MET BRANDON,
JUSTIN AND SPENCER.

22:24.924 --> 22:27.306
THERE'S SOMETHING I REALLY
NEED TO TELL YOU FACE TO FACE.

22:27.306 --> 22:29.138
NO, DON'T SAY FACE TO FACE.
