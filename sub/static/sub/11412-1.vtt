I thought it was
the bride that...

03:04.619 --> 03:05.707
Shh!

03:08.710 --> 03:10.842
That cop
is watching us.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.889
Don't point at him,
Charlie.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.369
Relax. Why would he?

03:15.412 --> 03:17.240
Well, think about it.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.589
I mean, if your
parents freaked out,

03:18.633 --> 03:20.156
they'd call
the cops, right?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.723
I mean, what
we're doing, it's...

03:21.766 --> 03:22.941
Technically,
it's illegal.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.508
Don't worry about it.

03:24.552 --> 03:27.294
Nobody knows we're
getting married, Charlie.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.034
It's okay.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.688
No one. Yeah.

03:33.561 --> 03:34.823
Except for my mother.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.694
You what?

03:36.738 --> 03:38.043
I'm sorry,
I wrote her a note.

03:38.087 --> 03:39.741
I didn't want her
to worry about me.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.962
We better
get out of here. Come on.

04:00.588 --> 04:01.763
Sorry.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.385
Good dog.
Well done.

04:48.897 --> 04:51.291
God, that cop
is right behind us.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.864
Charlie, it's just
a coincidence.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.737
Let's find out
for sure.

05:34.508 --> 05:37.641
Okay, okay, okay,
you were right.

05:38.903 --> 05:41.079
I was right.You know what?

05:41.123 --> 05:42.516
If your mom did
blow the whistle,

05:42.559 --> 05:44.779
we'd be a lot safer takin' this back road to Vegas.

05:47.216 --> 05:50.045
I don't know,
Charlie. It's just...

05:50.088 --> 05:51.089
It's dark.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.222
Rachel?

05:53.744 --> 05:54.789
What?

05:55.833 --> 05:58.358
Trust me. Come here.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.322
Mmm.

06:07.192 --> 06:08.716
Get in the car.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.664
Wait, Charlie.
Charlie?

06:43.707 --> 06:44.795
Mmm?

06:44.839 --> 06:47.015
Not in a Ford Pinto.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.931
Just close your eyes
and picture a Porsche.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.763
Look, I want this
as much as you do,

06:55.806 --> 06:57.547
it just isn't right.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.769
Being in our
own great big bed,

07:02.552 --> 07:03.988
no parents,

07:05.425 --> 07:06.774
no curfews,

07:08.558 --> 07:10.430
no frustrations.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.564
And no clothes.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.788
Uh, yes. Yes.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.921
Definitely no clothes.

08:10.359 --> 08:12.666
What do you
need, son?

08:12.709 --> 08:15.059
Could you
fill her up, please?

08:15.103 --> 08:16.104
Unleaded.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.229
Thanks.
What do I owe ya?

08:54.272 --> 08:57.580
Gas is $8,
and advice is free.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.627
You headin'
for Las Vegas?

09:01.889 --> 09:03.543
Why do you ask?

09:03.586 --> 09:07.024
Well, it's an old road
and needs a lot of repair.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.723
You'd be a lot safer
on the Interstate.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.249
Well, we'll be
all right. $8.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.337
Thank you.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.647
Back, Ben. Back.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.568
Uh-huh.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.267
Oh, Charlie.
I got it. Oh, no.

09:42.407 --> 09:43.713
Thank you.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.063
I took shop
in high school.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.676
Wrong car for this
kind of road, honey.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.982
You always
open this late?

09:52.766 --> 09:55.072
Don't sleep much
at my age.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.640
It's a biological fact.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.816
Back when I had all those things in the world to do,

09:59.860 --> 10:02.645
I had to waste
my time sleeping.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.692
Now, I got the hours
and not much to fill 'em.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.668
You kids look
pretty tired.

10:25.712 --> 10:29.716
I got a cabin out back,
nice bed, clean sheets.

10:29.759 --> 10:33.197
Won't cost you a cent,
and I'll guarantee your privacy.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.025
Oh, thank you,

10:35.069 --> 10:38.812
but we had our hearts set on getting there tonight, thanks.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.248
Well, listen, son,

10:40.291 --> 10:42.946
you keep your eye out
for two Joshua Trees.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.513
If you get sleepy,

10:44.556 --> 10:47.342
don't pull over till you pass the second one!

10:47.385 --> 10:48.473
You hear?

10:50.998 --> 10:52.173
What was that
about trees?

10:55.959 --> 10:58.135
Who knows?
Guy was like really weird.

10:59.615 --> 11:02.313
He's just lonely.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.533
Yeah, well, we both know what that's like.
Mmm-hmm.

11:15.587 --> 11:16.676
Navy brats
see the world,

11:16.719 --> 11:18.547
but we lived
like gypsies.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.289
I didn't mind that so much,
till I met you.

11:23.770 --> 11:27.425
You make me feel
really good about myself.

11:28.775 --> 11:29.993
Rachel?

11:32.300 --> 11:34.041
Oh, great!

11:35.390 --> 11:38.349
I pour my guts out to you,
and you're asleep.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.874
What do you think, Ben?

11:42.440 --> 11:43.703
Ben?

11:48.620 --> 11:51.536
Okay, okay, okay.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.930
I'm driving through
the middle of nowhere,

11:53.974 --> 11:56.019
and I'm talking
to myself.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.841
Where the hell
did he come from?

12:34.884 --> 12:36.364
Damn it!

12:48.550 --> 12:50.030
Jesus!

12:51.335 --> 12:54.164
What, uh,
seems to be the problem, officer?

12:55.470 --> 12:56.776
What's he doing?

13:01.868 --> 13:02.956
Charlie?

13:06.960 --> 13:09.701
Charlie! Charlie! CHARLIE: Hey! Hey!

13:09.745 --> 13:12.008
Hey! Hey! Hey!

13:13.270 --> 13:15.272
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

13:16.056 --> 13:18.362
Charlie! Charlie!

13:18.406 --> 13:21.191
Charlie!

13:21.235 --> 13:22.323
What are you doing?

13:22.366 --> 13:24.716
What do you want?
Let me go!

13:25.413 --> 13:26.588
No!

13:27.067 --> 13:28.503
Charlie! Ow!

13:32.942 --> 13:34.074
Help!

13:38.208 --> 13:39.731
Let go of me!

14:52.500 --> 14:53.718
Rachel?

15:01.161 --> 15:02.379
Rachel!

15:24.749 --> 15:26.621
Why didn't you want us
going out on that road?

15:26.664 --> 15:28.884
What was
that about trees?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.974
You wouldn't believe
me if I told ya.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.062
What happened
to your girlfriend?

15:33.106 --> 15:34.542
He took her!

15:35.804 --> 15:37.893
Who took her? Why don't you tell me?

15:37.937 --> 15:40.809
There's two roads
down there.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.985
There's a road
within a road.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.466
You can't see it.

15:45.509 --> 15:48.034
It's there, all right.
I been there.

15:49.644 --> 15:50.732
Where?

15:50.775 --> 15:52.342
The highway to hell.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.997
The highway to hell?

15:57.434 --> 16:00.960
This is not a joke!
I am not kidding!

16:05.225 --> 16:08.532
Okay, okay, okay.

16:08.576 --> 16:11.971
Okay, can you please just tell me where there's a phone?

16:13.102 --> 16:15.322
You can't phone hell, boy.

16:15.365 --> 16:18.194
You can drive there,
but you can't phone hell.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.894
They're all young and
every one of 'em pretty.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.638
They just didn't
disappear.

16:27.682 --> 16:30.163
I know where they went.
The Sergeant took 'em.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.078
Who is this Sergeant?

16:32.121 --> 16:33.383
The Hellcop.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.864
This was Clara.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.779
Pretty as
the day is long.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.911
God rest her.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.614
She made me this.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.747
She could make
any old piece of trash

16:49.791 --> 16:51.575
look like a work of art.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.708
This was
a piece of hubcap.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.845
Way back,
about 50 years ago,

17:00.889 --> 17:03.283
we drove out
from Oklahoma.

17:03.326 --> 17:06.721
I was gonna find work
so we could get married.

17:06.763 --> 17:08.462
She never made it.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.421
In the middle
of the night,

17:11.464 --> 17:14.381
I fell asleep drivin'
that God forsaken road.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.079
Did Clara
die in the crash?

17:17.732 --> 17:18.906
No, she disappeared.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.737
I never did find Clara,
but I've never given up hope.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.219
But you can do
more than hope.

17:26.262 --> 17:29.613
You've got to catch him
before he reaches Hell City.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.789
You'll need this.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.488
It's no ordinary gun.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.273
I'll get you some shells.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.368
I'm sorry I don't have
any more of them.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.765
This highway to hell,
how do I get there?

18:04.213 --> 18:06.389
You might get to hell
in that Pinto, boy,

18:06.433 --> 18:08.435
but this one will
get you back.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.308
It's beautiful.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.331
You better take
this antifreeze.

18:35.375 --> 18:38.595
It's got to be hotter
in hell down there.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.380
It's all right, Ben.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.004
You know, you're gonna
have to pass through

18:56.047 --> 18:59.486
to the other side
by sunrise.

18:59.529 --> 19:03.751
If you're not back in 24 hours,
you're stuck there for eternity.

19:04.839 --> 19:08.538
You know,
this whole thing is really my fault.

19:08.582 --> 19:11.193
She didn't even want
to take that road.

19:15.850 --> 19:19.070
You just drive back and forth between them two trees.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.463
Believe.

19:20.507 --> 19:21.943
Really believe.

19:21.986 --> 19:24.511
That'll pass you through.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.556
Good luck,
and Godspeed.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.390
Hey, I forgot!

19:35.696 --> 19:36.697
Son!

19:36.740 --> 19:38.786
There's somethin'
in that car,

19:38.829 --> 19:40.527
somethin' special!

20:01.112 --> 20:02.505
Okay, okay.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.533
All right. Okay.

20:40.326 --> 20:43.067
Okay.

20:43.111 --> 20:46.027
Okay, okay, okay.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.210
Now, then what's the...

20:55.254 --> 20:57.647
Where is she,
you son of a bitch?

21:01.825 --> 21:03.566
Oh, shit.Shit!

21:27.373 --> 21:29.288
I believe.
I believe!

21:32.073 --> 21:34.902
I believe!
I believe!

21:38.601 --> 21:41.169
I believe!

21:51.701 --> 21:54.051
What year did you say
that car was?

21:54.095 --> 21:55.879
Jimmy?
Come in, Jimmy?

21:56.793 --> 21:58.839
What year was it?

21:58.882 --> 21:59.970
Come in, Jimmy.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.343
Stay, Ben.

22:55.809 --> 22:58.289
Well, we're not
in Kansas anymore.

23:11.694 --> 23:13.043
Who are you?

23:13.087 --> 23:15.089
Where are you taking me?

23:50.124 --> 23:53.127
Sergeant Bedlam.
What a fine surprise. Hello.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.390
Perhaps I can interest you
in an omelet.

23:55.434 --> 23:59.263
Okay, in a bit of a rush.
I can understand that.

23:59.307 --> 24:04.094
I'll just cook you up
a fine head cheese omelet.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.403
Hey, Hellcop.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.580
How ya doin',
sweetheart?

24:13.277 --> 24:14.496
Hot enough for ya?

24:14.540 --> 24:17.847
Gonna be a real
scorcher today.

24:18.935 --> 24:21.677
Oh, I remember
when I was a little girl,

24:21.721 --> 24:23.505
it was so hot,

24:23.549 --> 24:27.117
my parakeet got stuck
to the bars of its cage.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.685
Poor little fella.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.472
He just melted.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.212
We had to scrape him
off with a spoon.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.956
Did I ever tell you about my third husband Klaus?

24:41.088 --> 24:43.090
He caught me in bed
with another guy.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.222
We were going at it
pretty hot and heavy.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.355
Just want a touch, that's all.
And I says to my husband,

24:47.398 --> 24:50.401
I says,
"Don't worry about this guy lying on top of me.

24:50.445 --> 24:53.622
"It's okay,
he's a doctor!"

24:53.666 --> 24:54.928
To the rim,
to the rim.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.365
That's a joke.
A funny joke.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.585
Well, laugh,
if it's funny, laugh!

25:01.891 --> 25:04.024
Coffee please,
coffee.

25:04.067 --> 25:06.896
Well, honey,
why didn't you say you wanted coffee?

25:06.940 --> 25:08.855
We got java,
we got mocha java...

25:15.731 --> 25:17.777
Get out of the way.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.693
Mr. Hellcop,
can you do this?

25:24.479 --> 25:26.437
Hey, there's something
behind you.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.004
Boo-boo-boo-boo.

25:28.048 --> 25:31.878
I got his mud!
Get out of my way!

25:31.921 --> 25:34.141
I got his mud!
I got his mud!

25:49.765 --> 25:53.421
Who needs mesquite
when you've got concrete?

25:53.464 --> 25:55.031
Please, tell me
how to get out of here!

25:55.075 --> 25:56.642
Uh, I don't know.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.905
But I do know that this steak has your name on it.

25:58.948 --> 26:00.167
Ugh! What?

26:00.210 --> 26:01.734
Is it that
you're a vegetarian?

26:01.777 --> 26:05.520
Because I'm telling you this tastes very similar to chicken.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.828
Oh, Hellcop.
Hellcop, sir.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.960
You know that little blonde you came in with.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.745
She just took off.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.921
Just like that,
she just flew out.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.576
See you later.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.188
That way.
She went that way.

26:21.231 --> 26:24.539
I offered her my finest cut of beef,
and she snubbed me!

26:24.583 --> 26:26.019
Vegetarian bitch!

26:56.397 --> 26:57.964
Where you goin'?

26:58.007 --> 27:00.183
Would you please help me?
You've got to get me away from him.

27:00.227 --> 27:01.532
Okay, okay.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.404
But whatever
he's gonna do,

27:03.447 --> 27:05.232
we're gonna do it
twice as bad.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.583
Don't move.

27:11.499 --> 27:14.415
Anyway, where you gonna
run to down here, huh?

27:14.458 --> 27:16.373
There's only
one real way out.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.985
Would you please
tell me how?

27:19.899 --> 27:23.467
He sends you back
to do his work.

27:23.816 --> 27:24.860
Hmm?

27:32.215 --> 27:33.652
My old lady.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.010
What? Huh?

27:44.053 --> 27:47.187
Embarrassing, big guy,
embarrassing!

27:47.230 --> 27:50.712
A girl from up there getting away from you on your own turf!

27:50.756 --> 27:53.976
I mean, if he ever found out,
you'd be in big shit.

27:55.804 --> 27:57.980
Tell you what
I'm gonna do, okay?

27:58.024 --> 28:02.419
I'll give her back,
and I won't say how you messed up.

28:02.463 --> 28:04.073
But you owe me.

28:04.117 --> 28:07.381
Deal? Hmm?

28:11.733 --> 28:13.169
Well, I'll take that
for a yes.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.090
Bastard!

28:21.134 --> 28:23.876
Down here,
that's a compliment.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.166
Hi, need a passenger?

28:53.209 --> 28:54.341
That depends.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.082
Can you tell me
the quickest way to hell?

28:56.125 --> 28:59.215
Sex, drugs,
rock 'n roll.

28:59.259 --> 29:01.609
I've gotta catch a cop before he gets to Hell City.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.045
Oh, Hellcop. Huh! Yeah.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.786
Dream on, man.
No way.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.570
You just better hope
he doesn't get you.

29:06.614 --> 29:09.530
Well,
I'll take my chances.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.314
He's got
my girlfriend.

29:11.358 --> 29:12.707
So, you need me.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.274
Why do I need you?

29:14.317 --> 29:16.232
Because I know where
Hellcop takes 'em.

29:19.148 --> 29:21.150
Oh, okay.
All right, get in.

29:21.194 --> 29:23.979
Well, there's
just one thing.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.415
Have you got
room for two?

29:39.865 --> 29:42.215
You scream!
We all scream!

29:45.740 --> 29:47.611
I'm gonna
scoop your brains!

29:51.877 --> 29:54.357
Now you can scoop
your own brains.

29:54.401 --> 29:56.882
Hey, how about a little hot java for the long trip?

30:00.407 --> 30:02.888
That's quite a little
hand gesture.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.566
Prime,
grade A beef here.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.357
Raw it might be,
but we can cook it for ya.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.750
Hey, hey,
please, let me go!

30:39.794 --> 30:41.187
Hellcop's getting away!

30:41.230 --> 30:42.362
What's going on?

30:42.405 --> 30:44.016
You know
this guy's alive?

30:44.059 --> 30:45.800
So am I.Yeah, but
he's different.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.934
He's after the Sergeant,
so he's dead meat anyway.

30:48.977 --> 30:51.458
Hey, come on, he just left.
I gotta catch him!

30:51.501 --> 30:53.677
Come on! What's your name?

30:53.721 --> 30:55.114
Charlie Sykes.

30:55.157 --> 30:57.029
Charlie Sykes!

30:57.072 --> 30:59.901
Charlie Sykes!
Charlie!

30:59.945 --> 31:02.861
Charlie Sykes, you're after
the Sergeant, Charlie?

31:02.904 --> 31:04.384
You're crazy!

31:07.300 --> 31:09.432
I like that, Charlie.

31:09.476 --> 31:10.651
Why are you chasing him?

31:10.694 --> 31:12.522
He's got my girlfriend.

31:12.566 --> 31:14.698
Oh. Hmm.

31:16.657 --> 31:20.356
Okay, Charlie,
but you owe me.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.533
Whether you're dead the next time I see you or not,

31:23.577 --> 31:24.883
you owe me.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.015
Agreed?

31:27.755 --> 31:28.887
Agreed.Agreed?

31:28.930 --> 31:29.931
Agreed! Agreed?

31:29.975 --> 31:31.541
Agreed!

31:31.585 --> 31:33.239
Agreed.

31:36.546 --> 31:37.939
Let him go.

31:49.603 --> 31:50.865
Clara?

32:00.005 --> 32:02.703
Come back!
All you can eat!

32:02.746 --> 32:03.834
No charge!

32:27.075 --> 32:29.034
Charlie!

32:29.077 --> 32:30.644
Help! CHARLIE: Stop the car!

32:51.752 --> 32:52.971
Pull over!

33:09.813 --> 33:11.250
God damn!

33:17.082 --> 33:18.779
Shoot him, Charlie!

33:18.822 --> 33:21.738
No, Rachel,
I can't shoot him with you there!

33:27.744 --> 33:29.181
Come on!
Let her go!

33:29.224 --> 33:30.573
Pull over!

33:33.228 --> 33:35.100
Hold on, Rachel!
Hold on!

33:38.277 --> 33:40.061
Grab him, Rachel!
Grab him!

33:49.201 --> 33:51.420
Rachel,
grab his head!

33:53.248 --> 33:54.510
Rachel!

35:06.713 --> 35:08.541
Uh, hello?

35:08.584 --> 35:10.673
Yes, Motorist Aid.
What seems to be the problem?

35:10.717 --> 35:12.327
Oh, well plenty.

35:13.372 --> 35:16.679
My car's out of oil
and won't start.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.464
Really? Really.

35:18.507 --> 35:20.814
Do you think I could get some help down here, please?

35:20.857 --> 35:24.383
Now, you're saying it's all out of oil and the car won't start?

35:24.426 --> 35:25.775
Yeah.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.951
Sounds like
you're walking, geek!

35:27.995 --> 35:30.519
Get those shoes on
and start doing it!

35:30.563 --> 35:33.000
Walk! Walk!
Walk! Walk!

35:41.226 --> 35:42.792
Hey, that's my car!

35:44.490 --> 35:46.709
Hey! Hey! Hey!

35:49.016 --> 35:50.060
Hey!

35:51.497 --> 35:53.412
Hey, this is my car!

35:53.455 --> 35:55.240
Hey, no harm intended.

35:55.283 --> 35:57.155
I've got a little salvage business up the road a piece.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.158
I usually keep
what I find.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.901
But since you say it's your car,
do you want me

36:04.945 --> 36:07.208
to haul it in
and fix it up for you?

36:07.252 --> 36:10.559
Yeah, if you could just take a look,
that would help me a lot.

36:10.603 --> 36:12.344
Didn't say
I'd look at it.

36:12.387 --> 36:14.041
Said I'd fix it.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.522
Not doing you any good
sitting out here

36:16.565 --> 36:19.394
like a big,
dead white elephant, now is it?

36:20.265 --> 36:21.266
No.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.093
Hop in.

36:26.532 --> 36:29.491
He can ride in the back with Adam.
There you go.

36:32.668 --> 36:35.280
What a great dog
you have.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.195
Hey, fella.
What's his name?

36:37.238 --> 36:39.545
It's Mr. Ben.
Adam, right?

36:39.588 --> 36:40.850
Right.Charlie.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.678
Nice to meet you,
Charlie.

36:42.722 --> 36:43.897
Beezle.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.510
There you go.

36:48.554 --> 36:51.078
It's all right, Ben.
Stay put.

36:52.427 --> 36:53.776
After you.

37:05.571 --> 37:08.922
♪ Hey, yeah

37:10.880 --> 37:14.144
♪ Oh, yeah

37:15.363 --> 37:19.802
♪ Yeah, yeah

37:21.804 --> 37:26.592
♪ Ooh, yeah

37:28.115 --> 37:31.553
♪ Well, yeah

37:34.339 --> 37:37.037
♪ Yeah

37:37.080 --> 37:39.518
Hell of a car you got
back there, Charlie.

37:39.561 --> 37:41.868
I haven't seen one like it
in maybe 50 years.

37:41.911 --> 37:43.217
You couldn't be
that old.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.699
Feel like it.

37:46.742 --> 37:49.354
It's hard to keep track
of time down here.

37:51.225 --> 37:53.053
Hey, uh, could you
speed it up?

37:53.096 --> 37:54.272
I'm kinda in
a hurry here.

37:56.622 --> 37:59.799
I've been tempted,
but the cops down here can get pretty tough.

38:01.104 --> 38:02.149
Tell me about it.

38:18.687 --> 38:20.428
There's nothing
I'd rather reach for

38:20.472 --> 38:24.040
than a fire-brewed
bottle of Styx Beer.

38:24.084 --> 38:28.218
Made from the filthiest waters from our own River Styx.

38:28.262 --> 38:32.135
Styx Beer is a third more toxic than any other regular beer.

38:32.179 --> 38:36.314
The worst beer, the filthiest beer,
the deadliest beer.

38:37.227 --> 38:39.491
It's Styx Beer.

38:39.534 --> 38:43.451
And now we return to our feature presentation,
Bowling for Leftovers.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.544
There you go, Charlie.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.198
Right as rain.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.332
How much do I
owe you?

38:54.375 --> 38:55.898
Ah, don't worry about it.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.031
Go to hell to pay.

38:58.074 --> 38:59.249
I might go
for a few beers.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.992
Want to come down
and sink a few?

39:03.036 --> 39:05.778
Uh, hey, no thank you.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.955
Listen, I really
appreciate this, but um,

39:09.912 --> 39:11.261
I'm in a real
big hurry.

39:11.784 --> 39:12.872
Please yourself.

39:13.394 --> 39:15.265
Hey, Beezle,

39:15.309 --> 39:16.658
do you know the way
to Hell City?

39:16.702 --> 39:17.833
Sure.

39:19.052 --> 39:20.270
All roads lead there.

39:23.099 --> 39:24.492
You ever heard
of Hellcop?

39:24.536 --> 39:27.147
Sure I have.
They call him The Collector.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.323
I don't know why,
but he, uh,

39:31.325 --> 39:33.196
he took my girlfriend.

39:37.026 --> 39:38.463
Is she, uh...

39:38.506 --> 39:40.116
Have you two...

39:40.160 --> 39:41.770
You know what I mean.

39:41.814 --> 39:44.947
Of course,
I mean, yeah.

39:44.991 --> 39:47.428
Oh, the only reason
I say is that

39:47.472 --> 39:50.083
Hellcop usually only goes
for beautiful, young, uh,

39:50.605 --> 39:51.867
virgins.

39:54.043 --> 39:59.048
Well, um,
she's not a virgin.

40:00.528 --> 40:03.313
We,
uh, did it in my Pinto.

40:05.011 --> 40:06.882
You'll be all right then.

40:07.883 --> 40:10.016
Thanks.
Come on, Ben.

40:27.816 --> 40:31.820
I was only sleeping with my husband's boss to advance his career.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.214
Next.

40:34.257 --> 40:35.824
I was only trying
to help.

40:35.868 --> 40:37.783
I thought he wanted me
to pull the plug.

40:37.826 --> 40:38.958
Next.

40:40.394 --> 40:42.657
Sure, I let little Frances
drink the bleach,

40:42.701 --> 40:44.877
but it's a lesson she had to learn for herself.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.008
Next case.

40:49.011 --> 40:51.449
We will soon be paving the way for those who come after you.

40:52.754 --> 40:54.626
Please form
an orderly line.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.416
Please stay in line and keep your complaints to a minimum.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.117
Thank you for your help.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.556
Hi, Charlie.
Oh, hi, Ben.

41:12.426 --> 41:13.558
Hey.

41:16.212 --> 41:18.127
What are you doing?

41:18.171 --> 41:20.521
I'm with you now.
I'm your driving partner.

41:20.565 --> 41:23.742
No, you can't,
you can't come with me.

41:23.785 --> 41:25.483
I can help you
find your girlfriend.

41:26.048 --> 41:27.267
How?

41:27.310 --> 41:29.704
I know where
Hellcop will take her.

41:30.879 --> 41:31.880
You do?

41:33.578 --> 41:35.667
Okay.

41:35.710 --> 41:38.974
Hey, listen, you just stay
out of the way, all right?

41:39.018 --> 41:40.541
It's very dangerous.
Okay?

41:40.585 --> 41:41.586
Okay.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.289
Keep your excuses
to yourself.

41:49.332 --> 41:51.378
We don't care.

41:51.421 --> 41:54.773
I don't care.
You don't care.

41:54.816 --> 41:57.906
No one cares.
So, why care.

41:57.950 --> 41:59.038
Thank you.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.913
Hey, Adam,

42:04.957 --> 42:07.089
how did you
end up in hell?

42:07.133 --> 42:08.830
I was too little
to remember.

42:08.874 --> 42:09.875
But you remember
Cleveland, right?

42:11.267 --> 42:15.054
Look, Adam,
hey, you can trust me.

42:19.232 --> 42:21.016
It was a long time ago,

42:21.060 --> 42:23.584
and my daddy was driving
a station wagon.

42:23.628 --> 42:26.369
I think I was sleeping,
but when I woke up,

42:26.413 --> 42:28.371
Hellcop was there.

42:28.415 --> 42:30.809
And he killed
everyone except me.

42:32.071 --> 42:33.899
Even my dog.

42:36.118 --> 42:37.685
How did Beezle get you?

42:37.729 --> 42:39.034
Hellcop brought me to him.

42:40.862 --> 42:43.778
What does...
What does Beezle do down here?

42:43.822 --> 42:47.129
Fix stuff.
He's teaching me to fix stuff, too.

42:55.573 --> 42:58.576
This is my girlfriend.
Her name is Rachel.

43:00.665 --> 43:02.362
She's pretty, Charlie.

43:02.405 --> 43:04.277
We better hurry.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.584
Listen, as soon
as I find her,

43:06.627 --> 43:09.369
we're gonna get
the hell outta here.

43:09.412 --> 43:10.936
Do you want
to go with us?

43:10.979 --> 43:13.634
Yeah, Charlie, I do!

43:13.678 --> 43:15.070
All right, it's a deal.

43:15.114 --> 43:16.550
Cross your heart?

43:17.856 --> 43:18.900
And hope to die.

43:24.776 --> 43:26.168
Let's give 'em hell.

43:26.212 --> 43:28.344
Hit it, Charlie!
Go that way!

43:55.284 --> 43:56.416
Stay. Stay in
the car, Adam.

43:56.459 --> 43:57.591
Okay.

44:11.083 --> 44:12.824
Mmm-hmm,
I like that.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.239
Hoffa's.

44:37.283 --> 44:39.198
Nah, Jimmy ain't here.

45:06.878 --> 45:08.444
Oh, oh, oh!

45:23.459 --> 45:24.983
Rachel!

45:26.898 --> 45:28.203
Where've you been?

45:29.552 --> 45:31.250
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

45:31.293 --> 45:32.904
No, I'm not!

45:33.687 --> 45:34.732
Ow!

45:36.734 --> 45:38.387
Stand back! Move!

45:39.737 --> 45:41.521
He's here, Charlie!

45:45.612 --> 45:47.440
Shoot him again!

45:52.924 --> 45:54.708
Move, Rachel. Move!

46:05.197 --> 46:06.241
No, Charlie!

46:07.590 --> 46:08.896
Let me go!

46:39.187 --> 46:40.580
Let me go!

47:00.034 --> 47:01.166
Hello, Adam.

47:01.209 --> 47:02.471
Hello, Beezle.

47:02.515 --> 47:03.995
Where have you been?

47:04.038 --> 47:05.692
I took a ride
with Charlie

47:05.735 --> 47:07.999
and I was going to
come back, Beezle.

47:09.739 --> 47:12.525
Charlie made me promise.
Can we still keep it?

47:13.308 --> 47:15.223
We'll see.

47:17.051 --> 47:19.662
You're leaking more than oil this time,
Charlie Sykes.

47:19.706 --> 47:21.534
But don't worry,
I can fix anything.

47:21.577 --> 47:24.406
Cars, people,
horse races.

47:31.587 --> 47:33.459
Is he going
to be okay?

47:33.938 --> 47:35.896
That depends.

47:35.940 --> 47:38.029
You promise
not to run away?

47:39.334 --> 47:40.901
Promise?

47:40.945 --> 47:42.990
I promise, Beezle.

47:43.034 --> 47:44.339
Give me your hand.

47:50.563 --> 47:52.478
Paging Idi Amin!

47:52.521 --> 47:54.001
Idi Amin,

47:54.045 --> 47:56.786
to the white courtesy
telephone, please.

48:01.139 --> 48:04.098
Idi Amin. Idi Amin.

48:04.620 --> 48:06.361
Idi Amin,

48:06.405 --> 48:10.975
to the white courtesy
telephone, please. Idi...

48:11.018 --> 48:12.759
He's not here,
go away!

48:12.802 --> 48:16.023
Get away from here,
you disgusting monkey!

48:16.067 --> 48:20.593
Don't get me wrong, I love undesirables.
I have nothing against...

48:29.776 --> 48:32.083
Charlie!

48:32.126 --> 48:34.041
Nice to have you back.

48:36.739 --> 48:38.524
How are you feeling?

48:41.309 --> 48:43.355
I don't know.

48:43.398 --> 48:45.531
I can't believe
I'm alive.

48:45.574 --> 48:49.013
Well, you might have been killed,
only the bullet couldn't pierce your soul.

48:49.056 --> 48:51.798
You've got a big heart, kid.
Hey, Jimmy?

48:51.841 --> 48:53.800
Come on, let's sit down.

48:55.410 --> 48:56.977
I'm not Hitler!

48:57.021 --> 48:59.632
We've heard that story
before, haven't we?

48:59.675 --> 49:01.286
Once it's explained,

49:01.329 --> 49:04.985
the devil will look at me and I'll say, "Goodbye, devil"

49:05.029 --> 49:06.900
and he goes,
"Goodbye, Bob!"

49:06.944 --> 49:09.337
Goddamn it,
I'll never catch up.

49:09.381 --> 49:10.860
You've done
all you can.

49:10.904 --> 49:14.299
Get back in your car,
go back to where you came from.

49:14.342 --> 49:17.476
There must be a million girls out there just like Rachel.

49:17.519 --> 49:18.999
No, you're wrong.

49:19.043 --> 49:21.045
She's the only one
for me.

49:22.263 --> 49:23.786
Where do you think
you're going?

49:24.657 --> 49:26.528
After them.

49:26.572 --> 49:30.141
Maybe he stopped.
Maybe they broke down.

49:30.184 --> 49:31.794
Maybe I still
have a chance.

49:31.838 --> 49:33.579
I know a shortcut
to Hell City.

49:36.756 --> 49:38.497
Where? Nearby.

49:39.411 --> 49:41.326
They call it
the "Road to Nowhere."

49:41.369 --> 49:44.633
In fact I'm 19!
Nineteen years old!

49:44.677 --> 49:46.853
I like to listen
to heavy metal.

49:46.896 --> 49:50.335
I like to sit in my room
and play air guitar.

49:50.378 --> 49:52.902
I like to dance around the room in my underwear!

49:52.946 --> 49:56.080
Would you just get over it
and get therapy like I did?

49:56.123 --> 50:00.127
No, I'm not Hitler and I should not be sitting at the same table

50:00.171 --> 50:01.476
with the Flintstones!

50:01.520 --> 50:04.653
I can't deal with this.
Do you have a blow dryer?

50:04.697 --> 50:06.568
Do I look like
I have a blow dryer?

50:06.612 --> 50:08.179
Well, you kind of do with that hair.

50:20.104 --> 50:21.322
Charlie!

50:21.366 --> 50:24.282
Hey, buddy, come on.
Let's go get Rachel.

50:24.325 --> 50:27.763
Adam's staying with me, Charlie.
He's my apprentice.

50:31.202 --> 50:33.160
Hey, Adam,
want a ride?

50:33.204 --> 50:36.468
Hey, I thought you said you wanted to come with me?

50:37.121 --> 50:38.644
Uh-uh, Charlie.

50:38.687 --> 50:40.733
Cross your heart?

50:40.776 --> 50:42.778
I have to stay, Charlie.

50:48.828 --> 50:51.831
Okay.
I'll see you around, kid.

50:53.006 --> 50:55.269
Hey, thanks a lot.

51:07.499 --> 51:09.066
He's afraid.

51:09.109 --> 51:11.329
I was never afraid.

51:11.372 --> 51:13.635
Hey, you tell me you're gonna send this little boy back up?

51:13.679 --> 51:16.595
Royce, I've told you,
it's not healthy to be so angry all the time.

51:17.726 --> 51:18.858
You don't care.

51:19.380 --> 51:21.078
Of course I care.

51:22.209 --> 51:24.168
But you always walk away.

51:24.211 --> 51:26.170
Every time,
you walk away.

51:27.214 --> 51:28.694
I'm going back up.

51:30.304 --> 51:32.567
Going.

51:32.611 --> 51:35.353
The winds of change are howling my name, Beezle.

51:35.396 --> 51:36.571
Howling.

51:38.399 --> 51:39.748
Don't be foolish.

52:00.117 --> 52:02.423
Oh, God,
the lost boys from hell.

53:58.147 --> 54:00.019
Clara? You're Clara.

54:03.631 --> 54:05.677
Sam is trying
to find you.

54:10.116 --> 54:12.031
She doesn't have
much time, Charlie.

54:12.074 --> 54:13.250
Yeah, I know.

54:15.687 --> 54:16.775
Don't take that road.

54:18.298 --> 54:20.953
It's a shortcut.I know it's the shortcut.

54:20.996 --> 54:22.302
But if you take
the shortcut, Charlie,

54:22.346 --> 54:24.043
you're gonna have
to choose.

54:24.086 --> 54:26.045
And if you choose wrong,
you're gonna be lost.

54:26.088 --> 54:28.003
You and Rachel.

54:28.047 --> 54:29.135
What do you mean?

54:31.398 --> 54:32.878
I made a choice.

54:32.921 --> 54:34.793
I was just
a stupid kid.

54:34.836 --> 54:38.144
I was a dumb kid who wanted to do something with my life.

54:38.187 --> 54:40.277
He tempted me
and I took it.

54:42.279 --> 54:43.845
What about Sam?

54:43.889 --> 54:45.804
I thought
I didn't need Sam.

54:47.022 --> 54:48.546
Yeah, well,
Rachel needs me.

54:53.202 --> 54:54.552
Maybe she doesn't,
Charlie.

54:55.204 --> 54:56.728
Maybe she does.

54:58.382 --> 55:00.122
Maybe she doesn't.

56:05.536 --> 56:07.233
Baby! Oh, God.

56:08.408 --> 56:10.541
Oh, Charlie,
I'm so glad you're here.

56:10.584 --> 56:12.586
Where is he? I don't know.

56:16.329 --> 56:18.679
Make love to me, Charlie.

56:18.723 --> 56:22.161
If you make love to me,
the devil won't want me anymore.

56:26.426 --> 56:27.906
I don't know.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.563
I don't know.

56:39.178 --> 56:40.309
Ouch!

56:43.269 --> 56:44.488
Charlie?

57:59.301 --> 58:00.738
Oh, Rachel.

58:02.696 --> 58:04.306
Make love to me,
Charlie.

58:04.350 --> 58:05.699
I don't know.

58:05.743 --> 58:06.918
Make love to me.I think we should
get out of here.

58:06.961 --> 58:08.049
Come to bed!

58:11.923 --> 58:14.012
Rachel? Come to bed.

58:15.883 --> 58:18.930
I want to give you
your bracelet.

58:19.408 --> 58:20.453
Oh.

58:21.933 --> 58:23.064
Mmm.

58:32.900 --> 58:34.554
Make love to me.

58:36.730 --> 58:37.949
Rachel!

58:55.270 --> 58:58.230
Rachel,
we should go now.

59:13.419 --> 59:15.856
It's really only
skin deep, isn't it?

59:17.510 --> 59:18.859
What the...

59:29.522 --> 59:30.610
Come here, baby.

59:30.654 --> 59:33.004
I love you, Charlie.
I love...

59:41.099 --> 59:43.144
Come to mama.

59:43.188 --> 59:44.668
Ooh, baby.

59:44.711 --> 59:46.365
Oh.

59:47.148 --> 59:49.063
Let's ring bells, Charlie.

59:53.894 --> 59:55.374
Come to mama.

59:56.505 --> 59:59.160
You know I love you.

59:59.204 --> 01:00:01.380
Be the devil's friend,
Charlie.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.303
Come on! Come on!

01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:15.002
You wanna fight,
come on! Come on!

01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:17.265
Come on! Come on,
you wanna fight, you ugly bitch!

01:00:20.007 --> 01:00:22.357
Let's make
the sheets sing.

01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:24.055
Oh, Charlie,

01:00:24.098 --> 01:00:28.189
I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

01:00:28.233 --> 01:00:29.364
Oh...

01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:44.553
Sorry, just not my type.

01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:11.755
Let's get
out of here, Ben.

01:01:48.008 --> 01:01:49.488
Rachel Clark...

01:01:49.531 --> 01:01:51.490
This could be your life.

01:01:51.533 --> 01:01:53.405
Choice number one
doesn't look so hot.

01:01:53.448 --> 01:01:54.711
Barefoot. Pregnant.

01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:56.713
Up to your arms
in pizza pies.

01:01:56.756 --> 01:02:00.020
You look like 10 pounds of shit in a five pound bag.

01:02:00.064 --> 01:02:03.415
But choice number two,
you could have it all, Rachel.

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:04.677
Fame. Fortune.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.244
Every note... Sublime!

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:08.376
Just have faith in us,

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.075
and forget about sorry old Charlie Sykes.
Sorry old Charlie Sykes.

01:03:57.137 --> 01:03:58.617
Back to the car, Ben.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.666
Ben, what are you doing?

01:04:18.115 --> 01:04:20.508
I owe you one, buddy.
Back to the car.

01:04:29.604 --> 01:04:31.606
What right have you
to cross?

01:04:32.607 --> 01:04:34.871
I have no right.

01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:37.090
My girlfriend has been taken to hell,
and I want to save her.

01:04:37.134 --> 01:04:39.745
It's too late.
Only the dead may pass.

01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:41.007
She's not dead.

01:04:43.053 --> 01:04:45.925
Please. Please,
just allow me to cross.

01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:49.711
Rules are meant
to be broken.

01:04:51.322 --> 01:04:53.237
But once
you have crossed,

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.542
there is no way back.

01:05:17.348 --> 01:05:19.437
This is your
place to leave.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.353
But remember,
evil has many faces,

01:05:22.396 --> 01:05:24.398
some of which are sweet.

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:26.923
Thank you.

01:06:05.657 --> 01:06:07.006
Hey, you!

01:06:09.878 --> 01:06:11.010
Stop!

01:07:05.673 --> 01:07:07.240
Charlie, I thought you were dead.
Don't move.

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:12.202
What are you doing?

01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:19.557
Oh.

01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:21.385
Oh, Charlie,

01:07:23.256 --> 01:07:24.736
what's wrong with you?

01:07:25.519 --> 01:07:27.260
I can't explain it.

01:07:27.913 --> 01:07:29.697
I can't explain it.

01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:33.136
Mmm.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.965
Are you okay?

01:07:41.187 --> 01:07:42.623
I think you left this
along the way.

01:07:42.667 --> 01:07:43.885
Charlie.

01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:01.425
Oh, my God.

01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:21.662
Charlie Sykes.

01:08:36.068 --> 01:08:38.157
Your name is not
in my book.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.335
Is there a black mark
on your soul?

01:08:42.379 --> 01:08:45.251
I don't know
what's happening here,

01:08:45.295 --> 01:08:46.904
but I'm taking
Rachel back.

01:08:46.948 --> 01:08:50.996
Rachel,
my sweet virgin child,

01:08:53.738 --> 01:08:56.219
you'll never keep her
away from me.

01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:00.353
You've heard her play?

01:09:00.397 --> 01:09:03.008
She can be magnificent
with my help.

01:09:03.877 --> 01:09:06.054
She can do anything
she wants.

01:09:07.665 --> 01:09:09.536
It is Rachel's choice.

01:09:11.799 --> 01:09:13.671
She's going back.

01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:17.501
Maybe she
doesn't want to.

01:09:18.545 --> 01:09:20.198
I want to go back.

01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:23.636
We're going to die
some day anyway.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.377
It's too early now.

01:09:27.206 --> 01:09:29.381
We didn't do
anything wrong.

01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:31.341
We haven't even
eloped yet.

01:09:31.384 --> 01:09:35.519
Precisely
why I like you, dear.

01:09:35.562 --> 01:09:36.911
We're still alive.

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:45.832
Are you sure you're alive,
Charlie Sykes?

01:09:45.877 --> 01:09:47.661
Stop it, I love him!

01:09:49.054 --> 01:09:51.404
I don't really
need Charlie.

01:09:51.448 --> 01:09:54.320
He stinks.
Perhaps I'll let him go.

01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:56.975
No, no.

01:09:58.368 --> 01:10:01.545
You let Rachel go
and you can keep me.

01:10:02.589 --> 01:10:04.330
No.

01:10:05.549 --> 01:10:08.421
Then you're gonna
have to kill me.

01:10:08.465 --> 01:10:10.380
Haven't you ever
been in love?

01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:12.686
I am darkness
made visible.

01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:15.646
I am the Prince
of Princes.

01:10:15.689 --> 01:10:19.476
I once basked in
the light of God's love.

01:10:19.519 --> 01:10:21.129
Then you must know
how we feel.

01:10:22.348 --> 01:10:24.698
I know how
everyone feels.

01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:31.662
And it is not love.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.753
It is fear

01:10:37.581 --> 01:10:39.017
and vanity.

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.677
Very well.

01:10:47.199 --> 01:10:48.244
Go.

01:10:49.593 --> 01:10:51.072
On one condition.

01:10:51.116 --> 01:10:52.378
Remember,

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.903
don't look back.

01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:16.750
Now, we'll have some fun.

01:11:20.537 --> 01:11:23.191
When we get out there,
stick by me

01:11:23.235 --> 01:11:25.106
and run like the devil.

01:11:33.941 --> 01:11:35.073
Charlie, come on.

01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:39.860
Ow! You okay?

01:11:39.904 --> 01:11:41.732
Don't turn!
Don't look back.

01:11:44.735 --> 01:11:45.823
I think
I can open this.

01:11:45.866 --> 01:11:48.304
Rachel? Rachel?
We've got company.

01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:57.313
You know,
I figured this out.

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:02.535
Charlie, hurry.
Get in!

01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:07.018
No key!I'll hot-wire it.

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:09.368
I don't know.
This car wasn't made in Detroit, you know.

01:12:10.978 --> 01:12:12.023
Hurry up!

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.335
Drive!

01:12:26.254 --> 01:12:27.343
Go on!

01:12:28.648 --> 01:12:29.997
We're turning back!
No, Charlie, no! I know!

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:31.085
I'm turning!

01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:40.312
There's no way out!

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.358
It just looks that way,
Charlie. Step on it!

01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:43.881
There no... Trust me!

01:13:12.997 --> 01:13:14.259
That ought to
slow him down.

01:13:38.936 --> 01:13:41.417
Hellcop! Hellcop!
Hellcop! Hellcop!

01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:45.377
Wait, wait, wait!

01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:50.077
No. Wait, wait...

01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:09.706
Where the hell
did that come from?

01:14:10.228 --> 01:14:11.403
Adam?

01:14:12.056 --> 01:14:13.144
Adam?

01:14:19.106 --> 01:14:20.194
Beezle?

01:14:23.241 --> 01:14:25.504
Hello, Charlie.

01:14:25.548 --> 01:14:28.159
You've made it.
You're a real player.

01:14:29.116 --> 01:14:31.162
I'm proud of you.

01:14:31.205 --> 01:14:33.512
And, Rachel,
Charlie's found you.

01:14:35.035 --> 01:14:36.907
Do you think
he can keep you?

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:38.343
What are you
talking about?

01:14:39.257 --> 01:14:41.128
You better hurry.

01:14:41.172 --> 01:14:43.914
Friendly Hellcop is on his way even as we speak.

01:14:44.871 --> 01:14:46.351
We're taking Adam
with us.

01:14:46.394 --> 01:14:47.483
He doesn't belong here.

01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:49.180
He doesn't want to go.

01:14:50.573 --> 01:14:51.704
Adam?

01:14:57.014 --> 01:14:59.233
I promised
I would stay, Charlie.

01:15:01.584 --> 01:15:03.542
And I promised
I'd take you with me.

01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:04.804
Remember?

01:15:04.848 --> 01:15:07.111
You really
meant it, Charlie?

01:15:07.154 --> 01:15:08.808
I'll go with you!

01:15:11.811 --> 01:15:14.727
Adam, I want you
to stay with me.

01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:19.036
No, he's going
with us.

01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:20.994
I may not be carrying
a pitchfork, Charlie,

01:15:21.038 --> 01:15:23.127
but I think you know
who I am.

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:24.868
Don't make me
lose my temper.

01:15:24.911 --> 01:15:26.739
Well, we just
met the Devil.

01:15:26.783 --> 01:15:29.437
One of my many,
many manifestations.

01:15:29.481 --> 01:15:31.439
But you helped me.

01:15:31.483 --> 01:15:33.180
You saved my life.

01:15:33.224 --> 01:15:35.443
People live,
people die.

01:15:36.096 --> 01:15:38.446
They come down here.

01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:41.362
I've got infinite levels
of hell for them.

01:15:41.406 --> 01:15:43.626
What you've seen
is nothing.

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:45.453
A mere kindergarten.

01:15:46.498 --> 01:15:48.369
It's so easy for me now.

01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:51.808
People have lost their willpower,
their hope.

01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:53.853
They think the world is
going to come to an end.

01:15:55.115 --> 01:15:56.987
Wishful thinking.

01:15:57.030 --> 01:16:00.207
The world will last a long, long, long,
long time.

01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:03.863
But you, Charlie,

01:16:03.907 --> 01:16:06.649
you haven't lost
your willpower.

01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:08.738
You've got guts.

01:16:08.781 --> 01:16:10.696
That's why I like you.

01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:14.570
But you can't
have Adam.

01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:17.529
Adam is not a game.

01:16:18.878 --> 01:16:23.100
Neither was Attila,
Napoleon, Adolf.

01:16:23.143 --> 01:16:25.842
Adam will go back
when I send him.

01:16:25.885 --> 01:16:28.279
Adam wants
to go back now.

01:16:29.323 --> 01:16:31.587
And I want to
take him with us.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.158
What are your terms?

01:16:38.202 --> 01:16:41.161
We'll race the Hellcop.

01:16:41.205 --> 01:16:44.338
If we make it out of hell
before he catches us,

01:16:44.382 --> 01:16:45.992
then we go free.

01:16:48.081 --> 01:16:50.214
If we don't,
you can keep Adam.

01:16:51.563 --> 01:16:53.347
Not interested.

01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:55.088
Me.

01:16:55.132 --> 01:16:56.612
What did you say?

01:16:56.655 --> 01:16:57.874
And me.

01:17:16.414 --> 01:17:18.851
You'll come of your
own free will?

01:17:22.115 --> 01:17:23.203
Yes.

01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:25.510
It's a deal.

01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:33.518
Have you met Royce?
A great disappointment to me.

01:17:33.561 --> 01:17:36.521
He was once a part of
my scheme of things.

01:17:36.564 --> 01:17:40.046
Like Adam, he is one
of my adopted sons.

01:17:43.833 --> 01:17:45.704
I'd like a child
with Rachel.

01:17:47.097 --> 01:17:51.014
I'd like a boy.
I don't always get what I want.

01:18:34.144 --> 01:18:35.972
There's your
exit point.

01:18:36.015 --> 01:18:37.713
If you make it,
you're free.

01:18:37.756 --> 01:18:39.540
If not, you're mine.

01:18:51.988 --> 01:18:53.772
Say hello to Sam
for me.

01:18:53.816 --> 01:18:56.514
Hey, Charlie,
suppose I made you quarterback of the Rams,

01:18:56.557 --> 01:18:58.951
would you give me
Rachel and Adam?

01:19:03.086 --> 01:19:07.003
You know, if you'd have said the Niners,
I might've said yeah.

01:19:07.046 --> 01:19:09.309
But you didn't,
so go to hell.

01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:12.748
Fasten your seatbelts!

01:19:23.062 --> 01:19:25.499
Beezle?

01:19:25.543 --> 01:19:28.981
Royce, what are you doing to Clara?
She's not looking well.

01:19:29.025 --> 01:19:30.809
Don't change
the subject.

01:19:30.853 --> 01:19:32.724
You're letting
them go.

01:19:33.856 --> 01:19:35.422
They won't make it.

01:19:35.466 --> 01:19:37.511
But you're giving
them a chance.

01:19:37.555 --> 01:19:39.687
When do I get
to go back up?

01:19:40.253 --> 01:19:42.168
Don't hold your breath.

01:19:42.212 --> 01:19:44.431
You owe me
a chance, Beezle!

01:19:44.475 --> 01:19:46.303
What have I been
doing here?

01:19:46.346 --> 01:19:50.916
I'm better than those God-fearing, sex-starved,
TV evangelists!

01:19:51.743 --> 01:19:53.614
I'm the guy!

01:19:53.658 --> 01:19:55.965
I'm the best!
I'm the one!

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:00.143
You're not.

01:20:01.579 --> 01:20:04.190
You were a great
disappointment to me.

01:20:07.672 --> 01:20:09.152
Kill 'em!

01:20:09.195 --> 01:20:11.023
No way!

01:20:11.067 --> 01:20:12.329
Come on,
let's get out of here.

01:20:12.372 --> 01:20:15.680
Come back! Come back!
You owe me!

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:23.514
Royce, face the truth.

01:20:24.471 --> 01:20:25.733
Eternity's ours.

01:20:25.777 --> 01:20:28.780
Well, eternity
lasts too long.

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:32.175
And if that boy's going back up,
so am I!

01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.853
You owe me!

01:21:04.163 --> 01:21:05.599
To my legions!

01:21:08.124 --> 01:21:11.127
Uh-oh, it's Royce.
He doesn't like me too much.

01:21:16.045 --> 01:21:18.569
Hey, Charlie.
Stop the car!

01:21:20.092 --> 01:21:22.268
Stop the car, Charlie!

01:21:22.312 --> 01:21:23.400
Come on!

01:21:28.361 --> 01:21:30.581
Go! Stop the car, Charlie!

01:21:30.624 --> 01:21:33.323
You're dead, sonny boy.
You lose!

01:21:33.366 --> 01:21:34.411
Give me the gun!

01:21:35.151 --> 01:21:37.327
Stop that,
stop pulling away!

01:21:38.676 --> 01:21:40.721
You're not
going anywhere!

01:21:42.245 --> 01:21:43.507
The kid's mine!

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:47.250
Let them live!

01:21:47.946 --> 01:21:48.991
Come on!

01:22:15.582 --> 01:22:16.932
Charlie?

01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:18.063
I know, I know!

01:22:31.076 --> 01:22:32.164
Hold on, Adam!

01:22:35.602 --> 01:22:36.777
Come on,
we're almost there!

01:22:36.821 --> 01:22:37.953
Do it!

01:22:38.518 --> 01:22:40.042
Go! Go! Go!

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.002
Here! The gun,
give me the gun!

01:22:49.094 --> 01:22:50.530
Did you get him? I think so.

01:22:50.574 --> 01:22:51.705
What's he doing?

01:22:51.749 --> 01:22:53.403
I don't know.
Reload! Reload!

01:22:55.057 --> 01:22:56.101
Go!

01:22:57.494 --> 01:22:59.191
Charlie! CHARLIE: What do we do?

01:22:59.235 --> 01:23:01.977
Shoot him in the
glasses, Charlie!

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.152
What?

01:23:03.195 --> 01:23:05.676
If you break his glasses,
it'll kill him.

01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:07.417
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:09.680
'Cause now
I'm on your side.

01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:18.297
Reload! There's only
one bullet left!

01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:19.385
Give it to me!

01:23:20.734 --> 01:23:21.822
Here!

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:29.308
It's on the floor,
get it!

01:23:33.486 --> 01:23:35.619
I can't find it! You gonna have to,
get it!

01:23:40.363 --> 01:23:41.407
God, help us.

01:23:42.104 --> 01:23:43.235
Come on, Rachel!

01:23:45.324 --> 01:23:47.152
It's not under the seat! Find it! Find it!

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:55.378
It's now or never!

01:23:59.121 --> 01:24:00.296
What are you doing
down there?

01:24:00.339 --> 01:24:02.211
I see a switch,
I think I know what it is!

01:24:41.032 --> 01:24:42.729
Oh, my God!
We made it! We're back!

01:24:42.773 --> 01:24:44.035
We made it!

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:45.993
Yes! We're back!

01:24:46.037 --> 01:24:47.125
We made it!

01:24:48.866 --> 01:24:50.389
I made it!

01:24:52.043 --> 01:24:54.393
Get out of
the goddamn car!

01:24:54.437 --> 01:24:56.352
Put your goddamn
hands up, now!

01:24:58.658 --> 01:25:00.747
Come here!

01:25:00.791 --> 01:25:03.446
You are in a whole world
of shit, boy!

01:25:03.489 --> 01:25:06.231
Want to tell me what's
so goddamn funny?

01:25:06.275 --> 01:25:08.103
I'm sorry.

01:25:08.146 --> 01:25:10.235
I thought that
you were someone.

01:25:28.732 --> 01:25:30.125
Uncuff me! Uncuff me!
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:25:30.168 --> 01:25:33.040
