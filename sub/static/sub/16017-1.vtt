WEBVTT

00:03.002 --> 00:04.045
(woman) LIVING IN NEW YORK

00:03.002 --> 00:04.045
HAS TAUGHT ME

00:04.087 --> 00:06.674
THAT LIFE IS FULL OF SURPRISES.

00:06.715 --> 00:09.510
THEY CAN BE SCARY,

00:06.715 --> 00:09.510
BUT IF YOU'RE OPEN TO THEM...

00:09.551 --> 00:11.512
(door closes)

00:09.551 --> 00:11.512
THEY CAN ALSO CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

00:11.553 --> 00:12.930
STEVEN.

00:12.972 --> 00:15.056
CHLOE.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.100
I KNEW THIS WAS

00:15.098 --> 00:17.100
GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.019
SO DID I.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.898
(grunting)

00:22.940 --> 00:25.150
OH, GOD! YEAH.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.903
OH! (moans)

00:25.192 --> 00:27.903
(moans)

00:27.945 --> 00:29.571
(continues moaning)

00:29.613 --> 00:30.489
OHH!

00:29.613 --> 00:30.489
I LIKE THIS PICTURE OF YOU.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.657
OH, THANK YOU.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.075
(squish)

00:31.699 --> 00:34.075
(both moaning)

00:34.117 --> 00:35.076
YEAH. UHH.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.078
OHH! OH, GOD.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.079
SUCH A BAD BOY.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.079
(switch clicks)

00:38.121 --> 00:40.081
(Steven) OH, YEAH, TAKE ME.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.167
AAH!

00:40.123 --> 00:42.167
OH! OH! JUNE.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.085
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!

00:44.127 --> 00:46.087
HEY, UM... I CAN EXPLAIN.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.131
NO, STEVEN, LET ME.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.384
(squish)

00:50.425 --> 00:51.927
JUNE, SWEETHEART,

00:51.969 --> 00:54.137
I SCREWED YOUR FIANCE

00:51.969 --> 00:54.137
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY CAKE,

00:54.179 --> 00:57.098
AND I'M GONNA BE LATE

00:54.179 --> 00:57.098
WITH MY HALF OF THE RENT.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.101
THAT'S RIGHT. MY ROOMMATE

00:57.140 --> 01:00.101
SLEPT WITH MY FIANCE

01:00.143 --> 01:01.896
ON MY BIRTHDAY CAKE,

01:01.937 --> 01:05.774
AND IT WAS THE BEST THING

01:01.937 --> 01:05.774
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.521

01:46.189 --> 01:48.525

01:57.367 --> 01:59.160
THEY GAVE ME

01:57.367 --> 01:59.160

03:35.507 --> 03:37.759
GOING HOME AND TELLING MY FAMILY

03:37.801 --> 03:39.469
THAT I'M A FAILURE.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.429
We have a spent

03:41.471 --> 03:43.431
putting you

03:41.471 --> 03:43.431

You're

03:45.308 --> 03:47.268
We've missed our last three

03:45.308 --> 03:47.268

03:47.310 --> 03:49.563
but no pressure, honey!

03:49.604 --> 03:51.314

03:51.356 --> 03:52.900
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO

03:51.356 --> 03:52.900
WAIT OUT THE STORM.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.296
LOOK AT MY THIGHS.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.924
TAUT. ROPEY.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.924

04:16.965 --> 04:18.550
MADONNA  ROPEY.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.927
(thud)

04:19.968 --> 04:23.388
I DON'T ENJOY RUDE WOMEN,

04:19.968 --> 04:23.388
LOUD WOMEN,

04:23.430 --> 04:24.681
TALKY WOMEN,

04:24.723 --> 04:26.307
OR REDHEADS.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.227
WE MAY OR MAY NOT

04:26.349 --> 04:28.227
BECOME LOVERS.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.478
THAT'S... UP TO YOU.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.480
(chair creaks)

04:32.522 --> 04:34.983
SO MY LAST ROOMMATE

04:32.522 --> 04:34.983
OF FOUR YEARS JUST MOVED OUT

04:35.025 --> 04:36.985
TO GET MARRIED,

04:35.025 --> 04:36.985
AND I SAY "ROOMMATE,"

04:37.027 --> 04:38.403
BUT WE WERE MORE LIKE SISTERS.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.948
WE HELPED EACH OTHER

04:38.445 --> 04:40.948
THROUGH ALL THE UPS AND DOWNS.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.699
NEW YORK CAN BE

04:40.989 --> 04:42.699
SUCH A SCARY PLACE

04:42.741 --> 04:43.825
WHEN YOU FIRST MOVE HERE.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.786

04:43.867 --> 04:45.786

04:45.827 --> 04:48.329
CHICKEN SATAY?

04:48.371 --> 04:49.748
TOP THREE THINGS

04:48.371 --> 04:49.748

04:49.790 --> 04:51.125
CHICKEN SATAY,

04:51.166 --> 04:53.334

04:53.376 --> 04:55.712

04:53.376 --> 04:55.712

04:55.754 --> 04:57.214

04:55.754 --> 04:57.214

05:08.976 --> 05:11.186

05:11.228 --> 05:12.646

05:12.687 --> 05:15.398

05:12.687 --> 05:15.398

05:15.440 --> 05:18.277

05:15.440 --> 05:18.277

05:18.318 --> 05:19.820

05:33.333 --> 05:35.210

05:33.333 --> 05:35.210
EVERYTHING I HAVE IN MY SAVINGS,

05:35.252 --> 05:37.378
BUT IT IS WORTH IT.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.630
OKAY. LET'S DO IT.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.300

10:13.572 --> 10:15.282
OH, SORRY.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.282

10:17.700 --> 10:19.119
SEXUAL HISTORY WITH THAT TUB.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.414

10:32.132 --> 10:34.301
MONEY YOU GAVE ME.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.343
THE EXTRA RENT MONEY?

10:35.385 --> 10:36.928
OH, WELL, DUH.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.928
THE REAL RENT IS WAY LOWER

10:36.970 --> 10:38.513
THAN WHAT I TOLD YOU,

10:36.970 --> 10:38.513
SO I USED THE EXTRA MONEY,

10:38.555 --> 10:39.680
AND I BOUGHT THE PURSE.

10:39.722 --> 10:43.684
SO... YOU'RE SAYING THAT

10:45.604 --> 10:47.481
BUT YES. THAT'S EXACTLY

10:45.604 --> 10:47.481

SUE ME.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.401

10:51.443 --> 10:53.487
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST,

10:51.443 --> 10:53.487
MY FRIEND.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.113
NOBODY GAVE ME A BREAK

10:53.528 --> 10:55.113
WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO NEW YORK,

10:55.155 --> 10:57.115
AND SHE'LL BE HAPPIER BACK

10:55.155 --> 10:57.115
IN OHIO OR WHATEVER.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.493
I REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST

10:57.157 --> 10:59.493
MOVED HERE.

10:59.534 --> 11:00.285

10:59.534 --> 11:00.285

11:00.327 --> 11:02.120
AND YOU SOLD ME A CONDO.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.120
AAH!

11:02.162 --> 11:03.746
AND THEN THE OWNERS

11:02.162 --> 11:03.746
CAME BACK FROM VACATION.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.416
THEY WERE REALLY ANGRY.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.416

11:06.458 --> 11:08.876
(laughs)

11:08.918 --> 11:12.088
WELL, IT WORKED.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.088
ALL HER STUFF IS GONE.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.383
NO, ALL OF  MY  STUFF IS GONE.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.383

TO PICK UP A RACQUET

11:25.268 --> 11:27.812
AND JOIN THE GAME.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.812
GOOD FOR YOU.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.565
YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN GO

11:27.854 --> 11:30.565
TO HELL, TOO. WAIT. WHAT? WHAT?

11:30.607 --> 11:34.361
YOU'VE SURPRISED ME,

11:30.607 --> 11:34.361
AND I'M RARELY SURPRISED.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.779
JAMES, MEET JUNE.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.779
JUNE, MEET JAMES.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.739
HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU,

11:36.821 --> 11:38.739
JUNE.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.741
SO YOU LIKE TO RUB-A-DUB-DUB

11:38.781 --> 11:40.741
IN THE TUB?

11:40.783 --> 11:43.328
WHAT? NO. WAIT. DID--SHE--

11:40.783 --> 11:43.328
SHE SAID THAT?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.580
WHATEVER. MOST OF THAT STUFF

11:43.370 --> 11:45.580
WAS JUNK ANYWAY.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.457
WAIT. WHO BOUGHT IT?

11:47.499 --> 11:48.791
HELLO, MOM,

11:47.499 --> 11:48.791
I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.460
I'M HANGING OUT

11:48.833 --> 11:50.460
WITH CHLOE'S STUFF.

11:50.502 --> 11:54.214
HA HA HA HA!

11:50.502 --> 11:54.214
CHLOE, YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.256
PUNS.

12:06.601 --> 12:07.768
IT'S--

12:06.601 --> 12:07.768
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.480
I WAS

12:07.810 --> 12:10.480
A HUGE "DAWSON'S CREEK" FAN.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.440
AW, THANK YOU.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.483
♪ I DON'T WANT TO WAIT ♪

12:13.525 --> 12:15.235
YEAH. (grunts)

12:15.276 --> 12:16.777
THAT'S THE SONG.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.406
YOU SOLD MY BEDROOM FURNITURE,

12:16.819 --> 12:19.406
TOO?

12:19.447 --> 12:20.781
YEAH. LIKE YOU SAID,

12:20.823 --> 12:22.659
ALL THE STUFF IN THE LIVING ROOM

12:20.823 --> 12:22.659
WAS JUNK.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.620
THAT OTTOMAN HAD BEEN

12:22.701 --> 12:25.620
IN MY FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.498
MY MOTHER GAVE IT TO ME

12:25.662 --> 12:28.498
WHEN MY NANA DIED.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.166
I WAS 9 YEARS OLD.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.836
IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT I OWNED

12:30.208 --> 12:33.836
THAT I EVEN CARED ABOUT.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.964
YEAH, WELL, YOU DESERVE--

12:33.878 --> 12:36.964
I'M SORRY.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.799
I'M REALLY NOT GOOD

12:37.006 --> 12:38.799
AT COUNTERPUNCHING,

12:38.841 --> 12:40.093
AND I BROUGHT A GUN

12:38.841 --> 12:40.093
TO A KNIFE FIGHT.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.886
I DID THAT ONCE.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.846
I WAS ARM-WRESTLING KEVIN SORBO

12:41.928 --> 12:43.846
IN A CANADIAN PRODUCTION OF--

12:43.888 --> 12:45.890
JAMES, NOT NOW.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.811
(door creaks)

12:50.853 --> 12:53.022
HMM.  HELLO.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.983
ROBIN, HI. I NEED TO BUY BACK

12:53.064 --> 12:55.983
THAT OTTOMAN THAT I SOLD YOU.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.820
OH, HMM. HOW'S IT FEEL BEING

12:56.025 --> 12:59.820
ON THE SHORT END OF THE STICK?

12:59.862 --> 13:01.615
HUH? YEAH.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.617
IT'S PAYBACK TIME, BITCH.

13:03.658 --> 13:04.825
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

13:03.658 --> 13:04.825
SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.827
WHOA! NO,

13:04.867 --> 13:06.827
I WAS ROOMMATE NUMBER FOUR.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.913
SHE STOLE MY JEWELRY,

13:06.869 --> 13:08.913
AND SHE GOT ME FIRED

13:08.955 --> 13:10.831
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.751
WELL, I FINALLY GOT YOU BACK.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.751
I'VE RECLAIMED MY POWER,

13:12.791 --> 13:14.210
AND IT FEELS AMAZING.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.213
YOU NEVER SAY HI TO ME

13:14.252 --> 13:17.213
IN THE ELEVATOR.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.213
I NEED THE OTTOMAN.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.006
I SOLD IT. THE FABRIC WAS...

13:17.255 --> 13:19.006
(whispering) DRAB.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.341
I'M SO SORRY.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.842
WELL,

13:20.383 --> 13:21.842
WHO DID YOU SELL IT TO?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.845
I NEED THE OTTOMAN,

13:22.885 --> 13:24.845
MRS. YILMAZ.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.681
I'LL PAY OVER FULL MARKET VALUE.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.015
I'M SORRY, BUT MY KIDS

13:26.723 --> 13:28.015
LIKE TO SIT ON IT

13:28.057 --> 13:29.934
WHILE THEY'RE PLAYING

13:28.057 --> 13:29.934
THE Xbox.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.853
THERE'S NO "THE," MOM.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.853
IT'S JUST "Xbox."

13:32.895 --> 13:34.230
YOU WANT A SPANKING, KADIR?

13:34.272 --> 13:35.106
UGH.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.106
(telephone rings)

13:35.148 --> 13:36.857
EXCUSE ME.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.319
OF COURSE.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.445
WE'VE BEEN WASTING OUR TIME

13:40.487 --> 13:42.071
DEALING WITH THE WOMAN

13:40.487 --> 13:42.071
OF THE FAMILY.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.072
(lowered voice)

13:42.113 --> 13:43.072
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:43.114 --> 13:44.783
NO! DON'T.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.867
DON'T!

13:46.909 --> 13:48.328
HEY, PAPA.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.872
LOOK WHO WANDERED

13:48.369 --> 13:51.872
INTO YOUR FROSTY FOREST,

13:51.914 --> 13:54.875
READY TO WHISPER

13:51.914 --> 13:54.875
WICKED PROMISES.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.878
(speaking foreign language)

13:54.917 --> 13:57.878
(giggles)

13:57.920 --> 13:59.880
(sighs)

13:57.920 --> 13:59.880
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:59.922 --> 14:01.048
GOING OVER YOUR HEAD

14:01.090 --> 14:02.883
AND DEALING WITH THE PATRIARCH

14:01.090 --> 14:02.883
OF THE FAMILY.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.595
HE'S OUR NEIGHBOR. HE COMES OVER

14:02.925 --> 14:05.595
TO WATCH THE WEATHER CHANNEL.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.846
Who is this prostitute?

14:08.306 --> 14:09.890
GET OUT.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.392
GET OUT!

14:11.434 --> 14:13.894
OKAY, GOD.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.894
I TOLD YOU, GET OUT.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.480
OKAY, LOOK,

14:15.522 --> 14:16.981
YES, CHLOE IS SCREWED UP,

14:15.522 --> 14:16.981
BUT, YOU KNOW,

14:17.023 --> 14:18.899
SHE DIDN'T START OFF

14:17.023 --> 14:18.899
THAT WAY.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.401
SHE WAS A CHILD ONCE.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.529
A NORMAL HUMAN BEING

14:20.443 --> 14:22.529
BEFORE SHE GOT SEDUCED

14:22.570 --> 14:25.490
BY THE DARK SIDE

14:22.570 --> 14:25.490
OR WHATEVER.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.283
SHE GOT THIS OTTOMAN

14:25.532 --> 14:27.283
AT A TIME IN HER LIFE

14:27.325 --> 14:29.160
WHEN SHE COULD STILL

14:27.325 --> 14:29.160
CARE ABOUT SOMETHING.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.287
DON'T TAKE AWAY

14:29.202 --> 14:31.287
THE ONE CONNECTION

14:31.329 --> 14:33.748
THAT SHE HAS LEFT

14:31.329 --> 14:33.748
TO HER HUMANITY.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.167
IF YOU DO, THEN...

14:36.209 --> 14:40.004
(sighs) THE CRAZY BITCH MIGHT

14:36.209 --> 14:40.004
BURN THIS PLACE TO THE GROUND.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.507
I LIKE TO WATCH THE FLAMES

14:40.046 --> 14:42.507
FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.966
IT REMINDS ME OF CHRISTMAS.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.929
(laughs) I'M SERIOUS.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.929
(laughs) OH.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.182
OH, THANK GOD.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.182
YOU GOT IT BACK.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.933
JUNE DID.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.933
SHE WAS KIND OF A GENIUS.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.310
HEY, ALL MY STUFF.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.521
HOW DID YOU GET IT BACK?

14:56.563 --> 14:57.772
I NEGOTIATED.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.652
(door creaks)

15:02.694 --> 15:04.654
HEY, LOVELY EYES.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.989
HOW COME YOU GOT

15:04.696 --> 15:06.989
SUCH LOVELY EYES?

15:07.031 --> 15:09.950
(high-pitched whimper)

15:09.992 --> 15:13.538
HEY, SO... IT WAS REALLY COOL

15:09.992 --> 15:13.538
WHAT YOU DID BACK THERE.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.040
YOU KNOW, ALL THE MEAN STUFF

15:13.580 --> 15:16.040
I'VE DONE TO YOU,

15:16.082 --> 15:18.793
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.793
THANK YOU.

15:18.835 --> 15:19.960
YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:20.002 --> 15:20.961

15:21.003 --> 15:22.171
WAIT. WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:22.213 --> 15:24.591
(creaks)

15:22.213 --> 15:24.591
AHH.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.008
OH, GOOD.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.427
(exhales deeply) WHEW.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.427
YES.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.053
I LOANED HER $1,000

15:27.468 --> 15:29.053
TO BUY THOSE.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.639
CHINESE ENERGY TABLETS.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.639
THEY MAKE YOU EXTREMELY FOCUSED

15:31.681 --> 15:32.973
AND SUPER SLUTTY. (blows air)

15:33.015 --> 15:36.644
WAIT. SO THAT--THAT WHOLE STORY

15:33.015 --> 15:36.644
ABOUT YOUR GREAT-GRANDMOTHER--

15:36.686 --> 15:38.187
THAT--THAT WAS A LIE?

15:38.229 --> 15:40.565
OH, NO, THAT WAS TRUE.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.565
YOU CAN LOVE GRANDMA'S OTTOMAN

15:40.607 --> 15:43.067
AND STILL WANNA MAKE MONEY

15:40.607 --> 15:43.067
ON PILLS.

15:43.109 --> 15:46.654
I HAVE PAID FOR DRUGS. YOU HAVE

15:43.109 --> 15:46.654
MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN DRUGS!

15:46.696 --> 15:49.699
I SELL THEM AND GIVE THE MONEY

15:46.696 --> 15:49.699
TO CHARITY.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.991
NO, I DON'T REALLY DO THAT.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.660
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

15:51.033 --> 15:52.660
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:52.702 --> 15:54.621
YOU--YOU JUST STAY

15:52.702 --> 15:54.621
THE HELL OUT OF MY LIFE!

15:54.662 --> 15:56.997
OH, COME ON. IT'S NOT

15:54.662 --> 15:56.997

I'D SURPRISE YOU.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.006
CAN I HAVE A SNACK?

16:06.048 --> 16:08.008
BREAKTHROUGH.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.008
UM, MAKE A NOTE OF THAT

16:08.050 --> 16:09.636
IN JEREMY'S CRAVINGS JOURNAL.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.861
I USED MY MILES

16:24.859 --> 16:26.861
TO COME HERE.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.028
(sighs)

16:28.070 --> 16:29.280
IS THIS YOUR ROOMMATE?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.031
OH! OH, YES.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.031
THAT WAS SO RUDE OF ME.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.116
HOW COULD I FORGET?

16:32.158 --> 16:33.910
EVERYONE, THIS IS CHLOE.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.172
blooping on video game)

16:50.092 --> 16:51.928
HEY, JEREMY.
