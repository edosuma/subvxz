WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:07.738
ALL RIGHT. GUYS,
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:07.738 --> 00:09.480
TAKE A KNEE.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.442
UH...MY KNEES DON'T
BEND LIKE YOURS,

00:11.442 --> 00:13.684
SO UNLESS YOU WANT
TO HEAR A LOUD SNAP

00:13.684 --> 00:16.717
AND INVEST IN BACK WHEELS
FOR ME, I BETTER SIT.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.550
DON'T FORGET WHAT'S
AT STAKE HERE;

00:19.550 --> 00:23.654
VIP TICKETS TO THE SOLD-OUT
ROCK-A-PALOOZA CONCERT

00:23.654 --> 00:26.597
AND FOR ANYONE OVER 21,
BACKSTAGE PASSES.

00:26.597 --> 00:29.630
WAIT. IF WE ADD UP
ALL OUR AGES, WE'RE IN!

00:31.562 --> 00:34.235
YEAH, WE'RE IN.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.636
PHONES READY?

00:35.636 --> 00:37.438
All:
READY.

00:37.438 --> 00:40.111
Man on radio:
( barking ) DJ BIG DOG'S BACK.

00:40.111 --> 00:42.313
I'M GONNA EAT YOUR CAT!

00:42.313 --> 00:45.646
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS GUY
REALLY SPEAKS TO ME.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.579
DJ: ROCK-A-PALOOZA TICKETS
GOING TO CALLER NUMBER 12.

00:48.579 --> 00:49.680
GO!

00:49.680 --> 00:51.082
GO, GO, GO!

00:52.083 --> 00:53.624
AAH, IT'S BUSY!

00:53.624 --> 00:54.755
OH, MINE'S RINGING!

00:54.755 --> 00:56.257
I'M THROUGH!

00:56.257 --> 00:59.130
CHLOE, YOU KNOW THAT'S
THE TV REMOTE, RIGHT?

00:59.130 --> 01:02.733
SHH, I'M TALKING TO RUSSIA!

01:02.733 --> 01:05.566
( with Russian accent )
DIMITRI, IS THAT YOU?

01:05.566 --> 01:07.498
OH, I'M IN!
I'M IN!

01:07.498 --> 01:09.600
DANG IT! I GOT
SOME PIZZA PLACE!

01:09.600 --> 01:11.272
( grunts )
I'M CALLER NINE.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.803
I'M DIALING THE LAST NUMBER.

01:12.803 --> 01:14.645
RIGHT NOW,
I'D GIVE UP SUPER-HEARING

01:14.645 --> 01:16.647
FOR ONE SLIM FINGER.

01:16.647 --> 01:18.509
PEPPERONI AND MUSHROOM.

01:18.509 --> 01:20.411
HEY, DO WE WANT CHEESY BREAD?

01:20.411 --> 01:22.783
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR STUPID QUESTIONS!

01:22.783 --> 01:25.216
OF COURSE WE WANT
CHEESY BREAD!

01:25.216 --> 01:27.618
DJ:
HELLO, LUCKY CALLER 12!

01:27.618 --> 01:29.520
WHO'S BARKIN' AT THE BIG DOG?

01:29.520 --> 01:30.661
THIS IS STAN.

01:30.661 --> 01:33.364
WELL, STAN, EAT MY CAT!

01:33.364 --> 01:35.726
YOU JUST SCORED
THE HOTTEST TICKETS IN TOWN.

01:35.726 --> 01:37.328
FORGET THE TICKETS.

01:37.328 --> 01:40.201
I GET TO EAT YOUR CAT?!

01:40.201 --> 01:42.203
♪♪

01:59.690 --> 02:02.122
GOOD NEWS.
I WAS ABLE TO BOOK
US A WHOLE SERIES

02:02.122 --> 02:03.794
OF SPA TREATMENTS
FOR OUR WEEKEND.

02:03.794 --> 02:07.428
AVOCADO MASK, SALMON OIL RUB,
AND SEAWEED WRAP.

02:07.428 --> 02:10.531
ARE THEY MASSAGING US
OR TURNING US INTO SUSHI?

02:10.531 --> 02:12.333
ELLEN, WE'RE GETTING AWAY
FROM THE KIDS FOR THE WEEKEND.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.905
THEY COULD BEAT ME WITH A BAG
OF ORANGES FOR ALL I CARE.

02:14.905 --> 02:17.868
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO.

02:17.868 --> 02:18.909
WHAT?

02:18.909 --> 02:20.241
WELL, THERE'S
ALL THIS YOGURT

02:20.241 --> 02:21.812
THAT EXPIRES
IN THE NEXT TWO DAYS.

02:21.812 --> 02:22.873
IT HAS ACTIVE CULTURES.

02:22.873 --> 02:24.245
WE DON'T WANT TO
COME BACK TO A FRIDGE

02:24.245 --> 02:25.876
FULL OF INACTIVE YOGURT.

02:25.876 --> 02:27.448
COME ON, ELLEN.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.450
YOU ACT LIKE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
AWAY FROM THE KIDS BEFORE.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.782
DON'T TELL ME THAT MY CONCERN
FOR OUR CHILDREN IS UNHEALTHY.

02:31.782 --> 02:32.883
I JUST THINK--

02:32.883 --> 02:34.855
AND DON'T TELL ME THAT OUR
SPENDING TIME ALONE TOGETHER

02:34.855 --> 02:37.258
IS IMPORTANT,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.859
EXCUSE ME, WHAT?

02:38.859 --> 02:41.262
NO, I MEAN, IT'S IMPORTANT,
OF COURSE.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.863
BUT WE'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME FOR THAT

02:42.863 --> 02:45.165
WHEN THE KIDS HAVE GROWN UP
AND LEFT THE HOUSE.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.198
HONEY, NOW YOU'RE
NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

02:47.198 --> 02:50.201
TYLER IS NEVER GONNA
LEAVE THE HOUSE.

02:50.201 --> 02:51.672
LOOK, MY MOTHER'S
GONNA WATCH THE KIDS

02:51.672 --> 02:54.405
WHILE YOU AND I GET TO SPEND
A LITTLE QUALITY TIME TOGETHER.

02:54.405 --> 02:55.746
IT'LL BE FINE.

02:55.746 --> 02:57.177
ARE YOU SURE?

02:57.177 --> 02:58.379
DOES SHE KNOW THE FIRST
THING ABOUT MOTHERING?

02:58.379 --> 02:59.510
I MEAN LOOK AT
THE RESULTS SHE GOT

02:59.510 --> 03:00.551
RAISING HER OWN CHILDREN.

03:00.551 --> 03:02.583
WHAT?

03:02.583 --> 03:05.386
NOT YOU. YOUR BROTHER
THE NEUROSURGEON

03:05.386 --> 03:07.288
WITH THE TWO HOUSES WHO
DOES ALL THE CHARITY WORK,

03:07.288 --> 03:08.359
HE'S A HOT MESS.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.892
I'LL GO PACK.

03:14.665 --> 03:16.597
Stan: I'VE NEVER MET
MY OWN GRANDPARENTS,

03:16.597 --> 03:20.471
BUT MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER
WAS A VERY RESPECTED INVENTOR.

03:20.471 --> 03:23.234
HE CAME UP WITH THE BUTT SCOOT.

03:23.234 --> 03:25.205
YOU'RE WELCOME.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.908
ANYWAY, INSTEAD OF THE LOVING
ARMS OF A GRANDPARENT,

03:27.908 --> 03:32.243
I ALWAYS HAD ROBERT,
MY STUFFED ORANGE MONKEY.

03:32.243 --> 03:34.715
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.518
LIKE ANY GOOD FRIEND,
HE HAD A SUPER-REINFORCED NECK

03:37.518 --> 03:39.750
SO I COULDN'T BITE
HIS HEAD OFF.

03:39.750 --> 03:43.494
THEN ONE DAY HE WENT MISSING
AND IT BROKE MY HEART.

03:43.494 --> 03:45.996
TO THIS DAY,
I WONDER WHAT BECAME OF HIM.

03:45.996 --> 03:49.530
DID HE JOIN THE CIRCUS?

03:49.530 --> 03:53.734
DID HE BUY A CATAMARAN
AND SAIL AROUND THE WORLD?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.766
OR DID HE GET CAUGHT UP
IN THE CUT-THROAT WORLD

03:55.766 --> 03:59.640
OF RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS?

04:02.773 --> 04:03.844
HONEY, COME ON.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.349
ELLEN. ELLEN. ELLEN!

04:08.349 --> 04:09.480
IT'S ONE NIGHT.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.283
HOW MANY DRESSES
DO YOU HAVE IN THERE?

04:12.283 --> 04:13.984
THESE ARE MY SHOES.
MY DRESSES ARE UPSTAIRS.

04:13.984 --> 04:16.026
CAN YOU GET THEM FOR ME?

04:16.026 --> 04:18.529
OKAY, BUT WE GOTTA HURRY.
MY MOM WILL BE HERE SOON.

04:18.529 --> 04:21.792
I KNOW. I SAW THE SKIES DARKEN
AND HEARD A CHICKEN SHRIEK.

04:21.792 --> 04:24.034
SHE'S NOT THAT BAD.

04:26.637 --> 04:27.938
OH, COME SAY GOODBYE.

04:27.938 --> 04:31.372
WE ARE ALL GONNA MISS
EACH OTHER SO MUCH.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.603
WAIT, YOU GUYS
ARE STILL HERE?

04:32.603 --> 04:34.605
I THOUGHT YOU
LEFT ALREADY.

04:34.605 --> 04:37.408
SWEETHEART, I WOULDN'T LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE.

04:37.408 --> 04:39.910
WE'RE ALL GOING TO MISS
EACH OTHER SO MUCH.

04:39.910 --> 04:40.981
YOU GUYS ARE
STILL HERE?

04:40.981 --> 04:43.414
I THOUGHT YOU
LEFT ALREADY.

04:43.414 --> 04:45.316
( groans )
THIS IS GOOD.

04:45.316 --> 04:48.959
NOW IF WE GET LOST IN THE DESERT
AND WANDER FOR 40 YEARS,

04:48.959 --> 04:50.991
YOU'LL HAVE AN OUTFIT
FOR EACH DAY.

04:52.423 --> 04:54.425
FINE, LEAVE
THE LITTLE ONE BEHIND.

04:54.425 --> 04:55.696
THAT'S MINE!

04:56.927 --> 04:58.369
KIDS, DON'T GIVE GRANDMA JAMES

04:58.369 --> 05:00.030
A HARD TIME WHILE WE'RE AWAY.

05:00.030 --> 05:02.302
BUT ALL SHE DOES
IS MAKE US DO CHORES.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.075
"WHERE'S THE CARPET SWEEPER?
WHERE'S THE DUST PAN?"

05:05.075 --> 05:07.307
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE!

05:08.379 --> 05:09.940
SHE SEEMED VERY
SWEET AND QUIET

05:09.940 --> 05:11.442
THAT ONE TIME I MET
HER AT THE WEDDING.

05:11.442 --> 05:13.984
WE PURPOSELY SAT HER
IN THE SUN SO SHE'D BE TIRED.

05:13.984 --> 05:14.985
( doorbell rings )

05:17.548 --> 05:18.789
Bennett: MOM!

05:18.789 --> 05:19.920
Stan:
GRANDMA JAMES.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.624
SHE'S BEEN AROUND
FOR 400 MILLION YEARS.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.025
WAIT, THAT'S SHARKS.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.057
I ALWAYS GET THE TWO MIXED UP.

05:27.057 --> 05:29.329
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.563
SWEETHEART, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST

05:32.563 --> 05:34.505
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE
TO WEAR CHILD-SIZED SHIRTS.

05:35.766 --> 05:38.739
AND ELLEN, LOOK AT YOU.
OH, NOT TOO CLOSE.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.742
WHATEVER'S KEEPING YOUR HAIR
SO BLOND IS BURNING MY EYES.

05:42.973 --> 05:45.416
I JUST LOVE WHAT YOU'VE
DONE WITH THE PLACE.

05:45.416 --> 05:48.018
NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD
PUT FOUR MISMATCHED RUGS

05:48.018 --> 05:49.720
IN THE SAME ROOM.

05:49.720 --> 05:54.024
IT REMINDS ME OF AN OPEN-AIR
BAZAAR IN MARRAKESH.

05:54.024 --> 05:56.887
DEAR NORA.
STILL SO FULL OF--

05:56.887 --> 05:58.759
--SWEETNESS AND LOVE!

06:00.391 --> 06:02.062
OH MY GOSH,
THERE'S A DOG IN HERE.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.094
YEAH,
THIS IS STAN.

06:04.094 --> 06:05.666
AND HE HAS FREE REIGN
OF THE PLACE?

06:05.666 --> 06:08.569
AREN'T YOU AFRAID HE'LL PEE
ON THE RUGS AND MAKE THEM WORSE?

06:08.569 --> 06:12.843
Stan: 32 MISTAKES AND SUDDENLY
YOU'RE A RUG-WETTER?

06:12.843 --> 06:14.745
LET'S GO.
WE NEED TO GET TO THE SPA

06:14.745 --> 06:17.147
BEFORE THE OLD GUYS
HAIR UP THE HOT TUB.

06:17.147 --> 06:19.750
WAIT! WE CAN STILL GO TO
THE CONCERT TONIGHT, RIGHT?

06:19.750 --> 06:21.151
YES, JUST BE BACK
BY CURFEW.

06:21.151 --> 06:22.853
All: YES!

06:22.853 --> 06:24.755
NORA, IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE,
YOU KNOW HOW TO REACH US.

06:24.755 --> 06:26.617
OH, PLEASE.
I CAN HANDLE MY GRANDCHILDREN.

06:26.617 --> 06:29.159
I MAY HAVE AGED A LITTLE,
BUT MY MIND IS STILL SHARP.

06:29.159 --> 06:32.022
I KNOW EVERYTHING
AND SEE EVERYTHING--

06:32.022 --> 06:33.624
( muttering ) DRAIN THE LIFE
OUT OF EVERYTHING.

06:33.624 --> 06:34.795
AND HEAR EVERYTHING.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.067
AH, HA HA.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.999
KIDS, LOVE YOU.
Avery: BYE MOM.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.931
OKAY.
Tyler: BYE.

06:40.931 --> 06:42.803
BE GOOD.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.575
DON'T OPEN THE DOOR
FOR STRANGERS.

06:44.575 --> 06:46.406
WATCH OUT FOR WEIRD MOSQUITOES.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.609
EAT THE YOGURT.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.711
THE FRUIT'S ON THE BOTTOM!

06:50.711 --> 06:54.745
OKAY, WHO'S READY
FOR SOME FUN GRANDMA-STYLE.

06:54.745 --> 06:56.086
YOU MEAN LIKE THIS?

06:56.086 --> 06:57.518
( granny voice )
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,

06:57.518 --> 07:00.050
THIS WAS ALL FARMLAND.

07:01.492 --> 07:03.494
OH, THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU MEANT.

07:03.494 --> 07:05.626
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM?

07:05.626 --> 07:06.957
REAL OLD.

07:06.957 --> 07:09.029
LIKE 30?

07:09.029 --> 07:12.463
NOW I DON'T FEEL SO BAD.

07:15.866 --> 07:17.538
ARE THESE CHORES
EVER GONNA END?

07:17.538 --> 07:18.969
AT LEAST WE'RE
NOT ON THE ROOF

07:18.969 --> 07:20.641
CLEANING OUT THE GUTTERS,
LIKE CHLOE.

07:20.641 --> 07:25.115
Chloe:
THE SAFETY HARNESS IS TOO TIGHT!

07:25.115 --> 07:28.018
YOU SEE HOW MUCH DIRT
IS UNDER THESE RUGS?

07:28.018 --> 07:29.980
YES, THAT'S WHY
WE KEEP THE RUGS HERE.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.082
TO HIDE THE DIRT.

07:32.082 --> 07:35.225
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN
SPENDING TIME WITH YOU KIDS.

07:35.225 --> 07:37.057
Stan: YEAH, I HAVEN'T SEEN
THEM THIS HAPPY

07:37.057 --> 07:38.889
SINCE CHLOE BROUGHT
HOME HEAD LICE.

07:38.889 --> 07:39.990
THAT'S RIGHT, IT WAS CHLOE.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.932
I'M STICKING WITH THAT.

07:41.932 --> 07:43.894
OKAY, TIME TO TAKE A BREAK.

07:43.894 --> 07:45.095
Tyler and Avery:
YES!

07:45.095 --> 07:46.797
LET'S DO CALISTHENICS.

07:46.797 --> 07:47.998
TOUCH YOUR TOES!

07:47.998 --> 07:51.702
Chloe:
I CAN'T FEEL MY TOES!

07:51.702 --> 07:54.945
WHAT IS THIS DISGUSTING THING?

07:54.945 --> 07:57.948
OH, THIS IS GOING
STRAIGHT INTO THE TRASH.

07:57.948 --> 07:59.079
ROBERT!

08:00.881 --> 08:02.112
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

08:02.112 --> 08:05.886
ROBERT IS AN ODD NAME
FOR AN ORANGE MONKEY.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.058
( sighs, thuds )

08:09.219 --> 08:11.922
I BET SHE WISHES
THOSE RUGS WERE IN HERE NOW.

08:18.068 --> 08:19.700
WHAT DO WE DO?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.772
WHEN SHE WAKES UP,
SHE'S GOING TO KNOW
STAN'S SECRET.

08:21.772 --> 08:22.973
SHE PASSED OUT.

08:22.973 --> 08:25.275
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE SHE'LL
FORGET IT EVER HAPPENED.

08:25.275 --> 08:26.777
THE DOG TALKED.

08:26.777 --> 08:29.039
I SAID A GOOD CHANCE,
NOT A GREAT CHANCE.

08:29.039 --> 08:32.913
YOU KIDS OUGHT
TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES

08:32.913 --> 08:35.115
PLAYING A TRICK ON ME LIKE THAT!

08:35.115 --> 08:37.588
MAKING ME THINK THAT DOG
WAS TALKING.

08:37.588 --> 08:40.691
AFTER ALL THE FUN WE HAD.
THE WINDOWS, THE RUGS!

08:40.691 --> 08:42.793
WE PLAYED 1970s TRIVIA.

08:42.793 --> 08:45.696
I WON, BUT YOU LEARNED
ABOUT WATERGATE.

08:45.696 --> 08:48.198
DID I, GRANDMA?
DID I?

08:49.900 --> 08:52.002
THE POINT IS,
YOU TRIED TO MAKE A FOOL OF ME.

08:52.002 --> 08:53.904
AND JUST FOR THAT,
NO CONCERT TONIGHT!

08:53.904 --> 08:55.235
WHAT?!
NO!

08:55.235 --> 08:57.938
GRANDMA, WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO THAT ALL YEAR!

08:57.938 --> 08:59.840
WE DIALED UNTIL OUR
FINGERS WERE NUMB!

08:59.840 --> 09:03.013
I CALLED RUSSIA!

09:03.013 --> 09:04.675
ENOUGH! NO CONCERT.

09:04.675 --> 09:06.617
I'M GOING TO THE KITCHEN
AND MAKE A PIE,

09:06.617 --> 09:08.979
THEN PUT IT ON THE HIGH SHELF
SO YOU CAN'T REACH IT.

09:08.979 --> 09:10.581
BUT GRANDMA,
I'M TALLER THAN--

09:10.581 --> 09:11.952
WHAT?
NOTHING.

09:17.087 --> 09:19.730
STAN!
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!

09:19.730 --> 09:22.893
I DON'T KNOW. I SAW ROBERT,
AND I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

09:22.893 --> 09:23.964
THIS IS AWFUL.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.565
WE'RE GOING TO MISS
ROCK-A-PALOOZA.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.167
I'M SORRY, I KNOW
HOW MUCH THIS CONCERT

09:27.167 --> 09:28.999
MEANT TO YOU AND I BLEW IT.

09:28.999 --> 09:31.271
IT WAS GOING TO BE A ONCE
IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.143
IT WAS GOING TO BE
MY FIRST CONCERT.

09:33.143 --> 09:35.906
IT WAS GOING TO BE
MY FOURTH CONCERT.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.180
OH, I FEEL HORRIBLE.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.582
THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY
TO FIX THIS.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.986
IF YOU CAME BACK TO ME, ROBERT,
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.989
HOW MANY OTHER DOGS CHEWED ON
YOU WHILE YOU WERE GONE, ROBERT?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.892
NO, NO, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.294
I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.134
Stan: ( sighs )
THIS IS TOUGH.

10:04.134 --> 10:05.906
IF I TALK,
SHE'LL KNOW MY SECRET.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.078
IF I DON'T, THE KIDS GET BLAMED
AND MISS THEIR CONCERT.

10:08.078 --> 10:10.180
OH, THEY'RE DEVASTATED ABOUT IT

10:10.180 --> 10:12.142
AND THEY'RE THE GREATEST
KIDS IN THE WORLD.

10:12.142 --> 10:15.145
WHAT DO I DO?
WHAT DO I DO?

10:15.145 --> 10:16.717
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

10:16.717 --> 10:17.718
COULD YOU GIVE ME A SECOND?

10:17.718 --> 10:18.819
I'M WONDERING IF I SHOULD TALK.

10:20.751 --> 10:21.922
( thud )

10:21.922 --> 10:25.095
THERE IS AN OUTSIDE CHANCE
THAT I JUST MADE THIS WORSE.

10:28.959 --> 10:30.931
GREATEST KIDS IN THE WORLD?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.903
UH, COULD YOU COME
HERE FOR A SEC?

10:36.667 --> 10:38.268
WHAT HAPPENED?!

10:38.268 --> 10:40.070
STAN, DID YOU TALK AGAIN?!

10:40.070 --> 10:41.742
I WAS TRYING TO HELP.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.013
STAN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'VE DONE?!

10:43.013 --> 10:44.715
WHEN SHE COMES TO,

10:44.715 --> 10:46.646
SHE'S GONNA BE EVEN
MORE ANGRY WITH US!

10:46.646 --> 10:47.918
LET'S STAY POSITIVE.

10:47.918 --> 10:49.920
IF SHE COMES TO.

10:50.821 --> 10:52.953
WE HAVE TO REVIVE HER.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.185
WAIT!
I'VE HEARD IT'S SAFER

10:55.185 --> 10:57.127
NOT TO TOUCH SOMEONE
IN HER CONDITION

10:57.127 --> 10:59.029
UNTIL AFTER THE CONCERT.

10:59.029 --> 11:01.191
TYLER, WE CAN'T DO THAT.

11:01.191 --> 11:02.292
CAN WE?

11:02.292 --> 11:04.034
NO, WE CAN'T.

11:04.034 --> 11:05.766
OH, NO.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.898
OH, HEY THERE,
GRANDMA.

11:07.898 --> 11:09.669
WHATCHA DOIN' THERE
ON THE FLOOR?

11:12.142 --> 11:14.875
HE TALKS.
HE REALLY CAN TALK.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.748
I'VE KNOWN HOW TO TALK
FOR A WHILE NOW, GRANDMA.

11:17.748 --> 11:19.679
I MEAN STAN.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.982
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT YOU KIDS
WERE PULLING A TRICK ON ME,

11:21.982 --> 11:24.084
BUT NOW I KNOW
WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.385
I WAS AFRAID OF THIS.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.717
WE ALL WERE.

11:26.717 --> 11:27.958
JUST PLEASE DON'T
TELL ANYONE HE--

11:27.958 --> 11:29.319
I'M LOSING MY MIND!

11:29.319 --> 11:31.321
SORRY, WHAT?

11:31.321 --> 11:33.063
I'M GOING CRAZY!

11:33.063 --> 11:34.795
UNLESS YOU HEAR HIM, TOO?

11:34.795 --> 11:36.166
BECAUSE IN THAT CASE,
ALERT THE MEDIA.

11:36.166 --> 11:38.368
WE'VE GOT THE WORLD'S
FIRST TALKING DOG.

11:38.368 --> 11:40.931
I THOUGHT I WAS THE WORLD'S
FIRST TALKING--

11:40.931 --> 11:42.903
OH.

11:42.903 --> 11:43.804
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.235
UH, NOPE.

11:45.235 --> 11:48.809
NOTHING. NO REASON
TO ALERT THE MEDIA
OR ANYTHING.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.811
THEN IT'S TRUE,
I AM HEARING VOICES.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.813
SERIOUSLY?
WE'RE RUNNING WITH THIS?

11:52.813 --> 11:54.885
HEY, THIS IS KINDA COOL.

11:54.885 --> 11:56.847
I CAN SAY WHATEVER I WANT.

11:56.847 --> 11:59.319
GUAVA.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.221
HUH, THAT WAS RANDOM.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.124
MY SUBCONSCIOUS IS TALKING
TO ME THROUGH A DOG.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.997
APPARENTLY,
I SUBCONSCIOUSLY WANT GUAVA.

12:06.997 --> 12:09.029
BUT I DON'T LIKE GUAVA.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.301
OR DO I?

12:11.301 --> 12:14.765
AH, LET THEM GO TO THE CONCERT.

12:14.765 --> 12:17.407
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SHOULD GO TO THE CONCERT.

12:17.407 --> 12:18.909
REALLY?

12:18.909 --> 12:20.871
YES, YOU SHOULD GO WHILE
YOU STILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

12:20.871 --> 12:22.943
BETWEEN A CONCERT
AND A SANDWICH.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.876
THIS IS A SANDWICH, RIGHT?

12:25.876 --> 12:30.220
WELL, UH, WE'LL JUST GET
READY FOR THE CONCERT THEN.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.783
WE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT
PAST CURFEW.

12:32.783 --> 12:34.054
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.355
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.358
GREAT!
THANK YOU!

12:40.931 --> 12:42.833
SO I GUESS IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

12:42.833 --> 12:46.096
YEAH, WE CAN CHAT OVER
A NICE, JUICY STEAK.

12:46.096 --> 12:49.369
AND THE CANNED HAM THAT'S BEEN
TAUNTING ME FROM THE PANTRY.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.541
YOU WANT TO GET ME
THAT CANNED HAM.

12:57.007 --> 13:00.450
OH, MY 9:30 IS HERE,
I HAVE TO GO.

13:01.952 --> 13:03.153
I AM GRETA.

13:03.153 --> 13:05.015
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE
UNDER THE SHEET.

13:05.015 --> 13:06.456
I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:06.456 --> 13:08.018
OKAY.
NO HURRY.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.993
OH, JUST GIVE ME A SEC.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.365
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M SNEAKING
IN A CALL TO MY KIDS.

13:15.365 --> 13:17.267
YOUR HUSBAND DOESN'T
WANT YOU TALKING TO THEM

13:17.267 --> 13:18.368
WHILE YOU'RE ON VACATION?

13:18.368 --> 13:19.900
BENNETT!

13:19.900 --> 13:21.301
GIVE ME THE PHONE.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.203
LOOK, I'M SURE
THE KIDS ARE FINE.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.005
WHAT ARE YOU
SO WORRIED ABOUT?

13:25.005 --> 13:28.979
METEORS, LOCUSTS,
FRATERNITY BOYS
GOING HOUSE-TIPPING.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.310
THEY DON'T DO THAT.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.811
THEY COULD START.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.444
HONEY, WE'RE
HERE TO RELAX.

13:34.444 --> 13:36.016
ENJOY YOURSELF.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.187
OKAY.

13:37.187 --> 13:38.949
I'M SORRY.

13:41.491 --> 13:42.893
GIVE ME THE PHONE.

13:42.893 --> 13:46.026
( groans )
DANG IT!

13:52.402 --> 13:53.403
( gasps )

13:53.403 --> 13:55.035
I'M SO SORRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:55.035 --> 13:56.907
I'M AWAY FROM MY KIDS
AND I CAN'T CHECK IN.

13:56.907 --> 13:58.308
AND I'M JUST SO WORRIED.

13:58.308 --> 14:01.972
I'M A MOTHER TOO,
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

14:01.972 --> 14:05.175
HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS,
SIX MONTHS, A YEAR?

14:05.175 --> 14:07.277
YEAH. SO, CAN I
BORROW YOUR PHONE?

14:07.277 --> 14:09.419
OF COURSE.

14:11.521 --> 14:12.953
OH, HEY! MY PHONE.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.025
YOU'LL GET IT BACK
AFTER HER APPOINTMENT.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.992
HEY, GRANDMA.
YOU COULDN'T SLEEP EITHER?

14:21.992 --> 14:23.193
THIS SEEMS SO REAL,

14:23.193 --> 14:25.035
BUT I KNOW IT'S
JUST MY SUBCONSCIOUS

14:25.035 --> 14:27.067
TALKING TO ME
THROUGH THIS DOG.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.239
I'M LOSING ALL MY FACULTIES.

14:29.239 --> 14:32.903
AND YET, THE STEAKS
WERE COOKED TO PERFECTION.

14:32.903 --> 14:34.604
YOU KNOW WHAT SADDENS
ME THE MOST?

14:34.604 --> 14:37.077
THAT YOU COULDN'T
GET THAT HAM OPENED?

14:37.077 --> 14:39.879
THAT I NEVER REALLY
GOT CLOSE TO MY GRANDKIDS,

14:39.879 --> 14:41.351
AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

14:41.351 --> 14:44.384
SOON I'LL BE MISTAKING
THEM FOR LARGE, TALKING GUAVAS.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.956
YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE GUAVA.

14:45.956 --> 14:47.887
I KNOW!

14:47.887 --> 14:51.421
WELL, MAYBE NOW'S
THE TIME FOR YOU TO BE
A BETTER GRANDMOTHER.

14:51.421 --> 14:53.463
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING
A GOOD GRANDMOTHER.

14:53.463 --> 14:55.525
I THOUGHT WE HAD SUCH
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

14:55.525 --> 14:58.628
BUT KIDS DON'T WANT CHORES
FROM THEIR GRANDMOTHER.

14:58.628 --> 15:00.400
THEY WANT HUGS AND KISSES

15:00.400 --> 15:03.533
AND EMBARRASSING STORIES
ABOUT THEIR DAD
WHEN HE WAS A KID.

15:03.533 --> 15:06.276
OH, I BET THE HOUSEKEEPER
HAS PLENTY OF THOSE.

15:06.276 --> 15:09.579
WAIT, I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

15:09.579 --> 15:14.314
MY MIND IS TELLING ME
IT'S MY FAULT I'M NOT
CLOSER TO THE KIDS.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.916
SURE.
GO WITH THAT.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.218
I'VE GOT TO MAKE IT UP TO THEM.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.689
WITH THE LITTLE TIME
I HAVE LEFT,

15:19.689 --> 15:22.953
I NEED TO BE AS LOVING
AND NURTURING AS I CAN.

15:22.953 --> 15:24.254
SPEAKING OF "CAN,"

15:24.254 --> 15:27.027
THERE IS STILL
THAT HAM UP THERE.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.128
HEY, YOU'RE OLD.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.131
WERE YOU THERE WHEN
THE GUY WHO INVENTED HAM

15:31.131 --> 15:33.003
FIRST LOOKED AT
A PIG'S BUTT AND SAID,

15:33.003 --> 15:36.636
"I GOTTA PUT SOME
OF THAT IN MY MOUTH"?

15:36.636 --> 15:40.040
WHY DOES MY SUBCONSCIOUS
HATE ME?

15:45.475 --> 15:48.148
THAT CONCERT LAST NIGHT
WAS AWESOME!

15:48.148 --> 15:49.279
AND THOSE SEATS.

15:49.279 --> 15:50.420
( yelling )
AND THOSE SEATS

15:50.420 --> 15:53.453
WERE SO CLOSE
TO THE SPEAKERS!

15:53.453 --> 15:55.625
CHLOE, YOU DON'T NEED TO YELL.

15:55.625 --> 15:56.726
( yelling )
I KNOW!

15:56.726 --> 15:59.429
I CAN'T HEAR YOU EITHER!

15:59.429 --> 16:03.193
HEY, STAN,
HOW'S GRANDMA?

16:03.193 --> 16:04.995
DOES SHE STILL
THINK SHE'S LOSING IT?

16:04.995 --> 16:07.397
OH, YEAH. WE HAD A LONG CHAT
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.

16:07.397 --> 16:09.539
IN FACT, SHE'S
IN THE KITCHEN RIGHT NOW

16:09.539 --> 16:12.402
TALKING POLITICS
WITH THE MICROWAVE.

16:12.402 --> 16:13.643
I DON'T KNOW.

16:13.643 --> 16:15.075
THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.377
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS GREAT.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.250
STAN'S SECRET IS SAFE,
WE GET TO DO WHAT WE WANT.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.412
I JUST HOPE WE CAN KEEP
THIS COVER-UP GOING.

16:22.412 --> 16:25.455
( still yelling )
THIS IS JUST LIKE WATERGATE!

16:27.357 --> 16:32.222
I'M JUST SAYING, WE PAY TAXES,
THEY SHOULD FIX THE POTHOLES.

16:32.222 --> 16:33.323
HI, GRANDMA.

16:33.323 --> 16:34.764
OH, GOOD. YOU KIDS ARE UP.

16:34.764 --> 16:36.996
I OWE YOU ALL AN APOLOGY.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.728
I'M SORRY WE'RE
ALWAYS DOING CHORES

16:38.728 --> 16:40.630
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN THE KIND
OF GRANDMA YOU WANT.

16:40.630 --> 16:42.172
( ding )

16:42.172 --> 16:43.533
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
I'M TALKING TO MY GRANDKIDS.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.775
COME, SIT DOWN.

16:45.775 --> 16:47.737
I'M GOING TO MAKE
IT UP TO YOU.

16:47.737 --> 16:50.310
I'VE GOT GIFTS YOU WERE
GOING TO GET AFTER I WAS GONE.

16:50.310 --> 16:54.384
BUT I'VE PRETTY MUCH GONE
BANANAS NOW, SO...

16:54.384 --> 16:55.745
GRANDMA JAMES,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO--

16:55.745 --> 16:58.088
NOW, AVERY, GRANDMA SAYS

16:58.088 --> 17:00.350
SHE'S GONE BANANAS
AND SHE HAS PRESENTS FOR US.

17:00.350 --> 17:02.392
DON'T BE RUDE.

17:03.753 --> 17:07.157
FOR YOU, CHLOE,
I HAVE AN ANTIQUE HAIR COMB

17:07.157 --> 17:08.798
MY MOTHER GAVE TO ME.

17:08.798 --> 17:11.201
WOW, GRANDMA.

17:11.201 --> 17:12.432
IS ALL YOUR HAIR
CLIPPED IN?

17:14.434 --> 17:16.136
AND AVERY, I KNOW WE HAVEN'T

17:16.136 --> 17:17.637
BEEN IN EACH OTHER'S
LIVES VERY LONG,

17:17.637 --> 17:21.411
BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING
THAT MY GRANDMA GAVE ME

17:21.411 --> 17:23.443
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.346
GRANDMA, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:27.617 --> 17:29.449
OH, IS THAT YOU AS A BABY?

17:29.449 --> 17:31.451
THAT OPENS?

17:31.451 --> 17:34.184
WELL, WHOEVER IT IS,
I LOVE IT.

17:34.184 --> 17:36.456
AND I HAVE SOMETHING
EXTRA-SPECIAL

17:36.456 --> 17:38.788
FOR MY FIRSTBORN GRANDCHILD.

17:38.788 --> 17:40.460
THE KEYS TO MY CAR.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.162
YOUR CONVERTIBLE?

17:42.162 --> 17:43.633
IT'S A CONVERTIBLE?

17:43.633 --> 17:46.836
OH, GRANDMA, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

17:46.836 --> 17:48.168
I WISH I COULD DO BETTER.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.369
SHE'S TEN YEARS OLD

17:49.369 --> 17:51.341
AND THERE'S ALMOST
300 MILES ON HER.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.204
THANK YOU!

17:54.204 --> 17:55.505
I WON'T BE USING IT.

17:55.505 --> 17:58.408
THE ONE THING I PRIDED
MYSELF ON WAS MY SHARP MIND,

17:58.408 --> 18:00.350
BUT I GUESS THAT'S OVER NOW.

18:00.350 --> 18:02.382
I'M GONNA GO SIT IN THE SUN.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.414
TURN ME IF I FALL ASLEEP.

18:07.457 --> 18:09.159
THIS ISN'T NOT RIGHT.

18:09.159 --> 18:12.162
YOU GUYS, THE POOR WOMAN
IS DEVASTATED, SHE'S BROKEN.

18:12.162 --> 18:14.324
WE CAN'T DO THIS.

18:14.324 --> 18:15.665
WE CAN'T ACCEPT
ANY OF THESE GIFTS

18:15.665 --> 18:17.497
AND WE HAVE TO TELL
HER THE TRUTH.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.300
BUT AVERY,
IT'S A CONVERTIBLE!

18:20.300 --> 18:21.831
I WANTED TO TAKE
IT TO THE BEACH.

18:21.831 --> 18:23.703
AND I WANTED TO PUT
THE TOP DOWN

18:23.703 --> 18:27.307
SO I CAN FEEL THE WIND
IN GRANDMA'S HAIR.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.609
YOU GUYS, IT'S NOT A TIME
FOR A TRIP TO THE BEACH.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.780
A TRIP TO THE MALL?

18:30.780 --> 18:32.642
IT'S TIME FOR A TRIP OUT
TO THE PATIO

18:32.642 --> 18:34.384
TO TELL GRANDMA THE TRUTH.

18:34.384 --> 18:35.745
CAN WE AT LEAST DRIVE THERE?

18:37.617 --> 18:38.618
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.390
WHAT ARE THE CUSHIONS FOR?

18:40.390 --> 18:43.323
GRANDMA, WE HAVE SOMETHING
WE NEED TO TELL YOU.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.394
YOU'RE NOT GOING CRAZY.

18:44.394 --> 18:47.497
STAN REALLY CAN TALK.
WE CAN ALL HEAR HIM.

18:47.497 --> 18:50.330
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU
TO TRY TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.433
I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND
OUT WHAT THE CUSHIONS ARE FOR.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.866
HE SAID, "I THINK YOU'RE
ABOUT TO FIND OUT WHAT
THE CUSHIONS ARE FOR."

18:59.509 --> 19:01.811
( thud )

19:01.811 --> 19:03.913
WHY'D YOU PUT
THE CUSHIONS OVER THERE?

19:03.913 --> 19:06.176
I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY
SHE WAS GONNA FALL.

19:06.176 --> 19:07.447
WHAT AM I, A LUMBERJACK?

19:15.925 --> 19:17.927
( snoring )

19:27.367 --> 19:28.738
THIS ISN'T YOU, IS IT?

19:30.500 --> 19:31.671
NO.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.373
WILL YOU FORGET
THIS EVER HAPPENED

19:33.373 --> 19:34.444
IF I LET YOU
CALL THE KIDS?

19:34.444 --> 19:35.505
SURE, IF YOU TAKE
YOUR HANDS OFF HER.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.579
GO AHEAD,
TAKE THE MASSEUSE'S PHONE.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.851
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

19:41.851 --> 19:43.483
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE DOING SOMETHING?

19:43.483 --> 19:46.386
ONCE THEY FALL ASLEEP,
I USUALLY STOP.

19:47.757 --> 19:48.758
AVERY!

19:48.758 --> 19:49.819
CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW!

19:49.819 --> 19:51.361
WE HAVE A SITUATION!

19:51.361 --> 19:53.493
SHE CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW!
THEY HAVE A SITUATION!

19:53.493 --> 19:55.295
I BET FRATERNITY BOYS
HAVE TIPPED THE HOUSE!

19:55.295 --> 19:56.766
AND YOU SAID
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN.

19:56.766 --> 19:58.468
YOU GET THE CAR FROM THE ROOM,

19:58.468 --> 19:59.929
I'LL DRIVE THE BAGS
AROUND FRONT!

20:01.301 --> 20:03.673
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
SHE'S USUALLY...

20:03.673 --> 20:05.975
JUST LIKE THIS.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.709
SO YOU ACTUALLY TALK?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.681
YES, YES I DO.

20:11.681 --> 20:15.245
I ALSO WHISTLE
AND PLAY A LITTLE HARMONICA.

20:15.245 --> 20:16.616
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.248
I KNOW.

20:18.248 --> 20:20.390
HARMONICA'S REALLY TOUGH
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE LIPS.

20:20.390 --> 20:21.751
WHO KNOWS ABOUT THIS?

20:21.751 --> 20:25.495
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY
WHO'S EVER PLAYED HARMONICA.

20:25.495 --> 20:26.926
NO, ABOUT YOU TALKING.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.958
NOBODY.
NOT EVEN MOMMY AND DADDY.

20:28.958 --> 20:31.731
AND WE COULDN'T TELL YOU
BECAUSE ONCE THE SECRET'S OUT,

20:31.731 --> 20:34.834
WE WERE AFRAID HE'D BE TAKEN
AWAY AND EXPERIMENTED ON.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.636
SO WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME NOW?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.438
BECAUSE WE CARE
TOO MUCH ABOUT YOU

20:38.438 --> 20:40.310
TO LET YOU THINK
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR MIND.

20:40.310 --> 20:41.641
AND WE ALREADY WENT
TO THE CONCERT,

20:41.641 --> 20:44.474
SO NOW IT'S OKAY.

20:44.474 --> 20:46.416
GRANDMA, IF YOU
MEANT WHAT YOU SAID

20:46.416 --> 20:47.477
ABOUT WANTING TO BOND WITH US,

20:47.477 --> 20:49.949
THIS SECRET IS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

20:49.949 --> 20:51.451
THAT WE COULD EVEN SHARE.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.924
KIDS, OH, I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT THIS MEANS TO ME.

20:54.924 --> 20:57.727
I WILL CHERISH YOUR SECRET,
AND I PROMISE

20:57.727 --> 21:00.330
IT WILL ALWAYS BE SAFE WITH ME.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.663
PREESH, GRAMS.

21:04.894 --> 21:07.036
WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD
GIVE THIS BACK TO YOU, HUH?

21:07.036 --> 21:08.438
NO, NO, NO.

21:08.438 --> 21:10.300
YOU KEEP THAT.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.442
AND CHLOE, YOU CAN KEEP
THE HAIR COMB.

21:12.442 --> 21:14.344
AND THE HAIR?!
OF COURSE.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.308
AND TYLER.
SWEET, SWEET TYLER.

21:18.308 --> 21:19.449
GIVE ME MY KEYS.

21:25.555 --> 21:28.388
I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR
SHARING YOUR SECRET WITH ME.

21:28.388 --> 21:31.721
AND HERE, STAN,
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

21:31.721 --> 21:36.366
( gasps )
YOU REPLACED HIS HIP
AND HIS KNEE.

21:36.366 --> 21:39.298
SOMEDAY I HOPE
I CAN RETURN THE FAVOR.

21:40.430 --> 21:42.472
( Robert squeaks )

21:42.472 --> 21:44.404
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?!
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?!

21:44.404 --> 21:45.735
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

21:45.735 --> 21:47.477
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

21:47.477 --> 21:50.640
SPOKEN LIKE SOMEONE
WHO DIDN'T HAVE TO PUMP GAS

21:50.640 --> 21:53.413
IN A LOOSE ROBE WITH
THE SANTA ANA WINDS BLOWING.

21:53.413 --> 21:57.547
( phone ringing )

21:57.547 --> 21:59.389
HELLO?

21:59.389 --> 22:00.950
DOES ANYONE SPEAK GERMAN?

22:04.023 --> 22:05.024
YA?

22:06.025 --> 22:07.026
YA?

22:07.026 --> 22:09.429
NEIN.

22:09.429 --> 22:10.560
GRETA WANTS HER PHONE BACK.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.661
THEY CLOSE AT NINE.

22:14.604 --> 22:16.105
Stan: SO NOW THERE'S
ONE MORE PERSON OUT THERE

22:16.105 --> 22:17.507
WHO KNOWS MY SECRET.

22:17.507 --> 22:18.708
BUT I'M NOT WORRIED.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.540
GRANDMA JAMES TURNED
OUT TO BE GREAT.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.474
I GUESS SOMETIMES IN ORDER
TO FIND YOUR HEART,

22:24.474 --> 22:26.015
YOU HAVE TO LOSE YOUR MIND.

22:26.015 --> 22:28.748
BUT ONE THING YOU NEVER WANT
TO LOSE IS YOUR MONKEY.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.980
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, ROBERT?

22:30.980 --> 22:32.922
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
THE LOVE OF MY--

22:32.922 --> 22:35.825
HELLO, SQUEAKY HAMBURGER.
( hamburger squeaks )

22:35.825 --> 22:37.757
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
