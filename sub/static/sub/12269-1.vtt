WEBVTT

00:02.233 --> 00:03.304
(Emily) MY FATHER
 WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.304 --> 00:04.635
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:04.635 --> 00:07.208
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:07.208 --> 00:10.211
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.742
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.742 --> 00:15.446
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
 THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.446 --> 00:18.389
(explosion, people scream)

00:18.389 --> 00:20.351
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE!
 I HAVE TO. JACK'S INSIDE.

00:20.351 --> 00:23.324
(sobbing) OH, GOD!
DECLAN. OH, MY GOD.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.625
THERE WAS A BOMB
AT GRAYSON GLOBAL.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.457
I THINK CONRAD MEANT IT
FOR ME.

00:26.457 --> 00:27.428
I WANT TO SAVE YOU.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.300
I CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY,
NOT NOW.

00:29.300 --> 00:30.431
MAYBE NOT EVER.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.462
CERTAINLY NOT FOR ME.

00:31.462 --> 00:33.033
WHERE'S MY BROTHER?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.735
HE'S GONE, JACK.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.607
FREEZE! FBI!
 GET ON THE GROUND.

00:36.607 --> 00:38.339
NOLAN ROSS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.171
(Jack) NOTHING THAT'S GONNA
KEEP ME FROM MAKING GRAYSON

00:40.171 --> 00:42.042
PAY FOR WHAT HE'S DONE.
 JACK, DON'T DO IT.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.314
(crying)
DON'T THROW YOUR LIFE AWAY

00:43.314 --> 00:45.616
BECAUSE OF THE CHOICES
THAT I'VE MADE.

00:45.616 --> 00:46.677
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:46.677 --> 00:48.279
I'M AMANDA CLARKE.

00:52.383 --> 00:54.085
(Emily) FEAR...

00:54.085 --> 00:56.287
IT'S A FIRE THAT BURNS
 FROM BIRTH

00:56.287 --> 00:59.430
IN EVEN THE COLDEST HEART.

00:59.430 --> 01:03.264
IT MOTIVATES AND PARALYZES
 THE BEST OF US...

01:03.264 --> 01:06.267
OR IS USED AS A WEAPON
 BY THE WORST.

01:07.598 --> 01:12.473
BUT WHEN YOUR PATH IS ONE
 OF TREACHERY AND DECEPTION...

01:19.310 --> 01:22.353
THE GREATEST FEAR OF ALL...

01:22.353 --> 01:24.485
IS THAT THE TRUTH IS ABSOLUTE.

01:31.322 --> 01:32.463
I'M SORRY.

01:32.463 --> 01:33.824
(gunshots)
 (gasps)

01:57.648 --> 02:00.791
(Quadron's "Sea Salt" playing)

02:00.791 --> 02:03.494
♪ I'M NOT TRYING TO RESOLVE ♪

02:03.494 --> 02:06.897

02:06.897 --> 02:09.759

02:13.334 --> 02:16.367

02:16.367 --> 02:18.769
AFTERNOON, SUNSHINE.

02:21.172 --> 02:22.243
I HOPE THIS WEATHER HOLDS.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.315
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

02:26.517 --> 02:28.148
WELL, IT'S NEVER RAINED

02:28.148 --> 02:30.581
ON A GRAYSON
MEMORIAL DAY KICKOFF.

02:30.581 --> 02:33.384
I'M NOT A GRAYSON YET,
DANIEL.

02:33.384 --> 02:35.726
THEN WHY DON'T WE
FINALLY SET A DATE

02:35.726 --> 02:36.927
TO MAKE YOU ONE?

02:36.927 --> 02:39.630
LET'S JUST GET THROUGH
TOMORROW FIRST, OKAY?

02:39.630 --> 02:40.731
YOU KNOW,
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

02:40.731 --> 02:43.464
YOU TRIED TO ENGINEER
A FAMILY REUNION.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.297
TOO BAD ONLY HALF MY FAMILY'S
GONNA BE THERE.

02:46.297 --> 02:48.299
BUT AREN'T YOU
THE SLIGHTEST BIT CURIOUS

02:48.299 --> 02:51.171
WHY WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOUR
MOTHER THESE PAST SIX MONTHS?

02:51.171 --> 02:53.173
WELL, I CAN ONLY HOPE AFTER
THE WAY SHE LEFT THINGS WITH US,

02:53.173 --> 02:56.607
THAT SHE'S IN SUCH
A DARK, LONELY PLACE,

02:56.607 --> 02:59.380
THAT WE NEVER HEAR
FROM HER AGAIN.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.412
(horse whinnies)

03:01.412 --> 03:02.883
(horse blusters)

03:02.883 --> 03:04.285
(bird chirping)

03:04.285 --> 03:06.357
(horse whinnies)

03:10.321 --> 03:11.492
(horse blusters)

03:13.424 --> 03:15.296
(horse whinnies)

03:16.567 --> 03:19.970
(laughs)

03:19.970 --> 03:21.201
(nickers)

03:21.201 --> 03:22.303
(whinnies)

03:22.303 --> 03:23.974
WOW. SURPRISED
YOU DON'T GET THROWN.

03:23.974 --> 03:25.536
YOU'RE LIGHT AS A FEATHER.

03:25.536 --> 03:27.838
OH, AND YOU'RE CONSTANTLY
SAYING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.981
SOMETHING THE MATTER?

03:30.981 --> 03:33.414
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU

03:33.414 --> 03:36.287
TO BE STAYING HERE
WHILE CONRAD RETURNS.

03:36.287 --> 03:37.548
HERE.

03:37.548 --> 03:39.990
OH. HEY, DON'T NEED--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ME UP.

03:39.990 --> 03:42.323
AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO STAY
WITH ME THESE PAST SIX MONTHS.

03:42.323 --> 03:45.826
I'M SO GRATEFUL
THAT YOU DID.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.298
YOU KNOW,
I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY

03:47.298 --> 03:49.500
TO HAVE YOU JOIN ME
IN THE CITY.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.861
I WASN'T TRYING
TO HIDE YOU.

03:50.861 --> 03:55.306
I JUST WANTED TO KEEP YOU
ALL TO MYSELF.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.876
HMM.

04:07.578 --> 04:09.380
(gasps) CHARLOTTE.

04:09.380 --> 04:12.483
OH, MY, I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

04:12.483 --> 04:15.986
WELL, APPARENTLY, WE NO LONGER
OWN PROPERTY IN PARIS,

04:15.986 --> 04:18.028
WHICH I LOVED DISCOVERING
AT 3:00 A.M.,

04:18.028 --> 04:19.959
AFTER CHARTERING A CAR
FROM BRUSSELS.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.531
DARLING, I'M SORRY
NOBODY TOLD YOU,

04:21.531 --> 04:25.436
BUT THE EUROPEAN MARKET
IS VERY STRONG RIGHT NOW.

04:25.436 --> 04:28.799
AS IS YOUR STABLEBOY,
IT SEEMS.

04:28.799 --> 04:30.471
I KNOW THE PAST FEW MONTHS

04:30.471 --> 04:31.642
HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT
FOR YOU,

04:31.642 --> 04:33.844
LOSING DECLAN AND THE BABY,

04:33.844 --> 04:35.576
BUT I WAS HOPING
THAT GRADUATING EARLY

04:35.576 --> 04:38.479
AND GOING TO EUROPE
WOULD PROVE RESTORATIVE.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.712
OR PERHAPS YOU'RE JUST
SUFFERING FROM JET LAG. HMM?

04:41.712 --> 04:45.285
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO HOME
AND LAY DOWN YOUR HEAD

04:45.285 --> 04:47.388
AND HAVE A GOOD BITE
TO EAT.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.790
WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER.
 (horse whinnies)

04:49.790 --> 04:53.424
THAT'S A LOT OF WORDS
FOR "WELCOME HOME."

04:53.424 --> 04:55.926
WE STILL OWN THE MANOR,
RIGHT?

04:59.630 --> 05:02.403
(gate buzzes)

05:02.403 --> 05:03.674
(clank,
men speaking indistinctly)

05:03.674 --> 05:05.005
(clatter)

05:05.005 --> 05:08.539
(gate closes)

05:08.539 --> 05:10.080
(man speaking indistinctly
 over P.A.)

05:10.080 --> 05:12.513
(gate buzzes)

05:13.884 --> 05:16.387
ONLY TOOK TEN YEARS
TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

05:16.387 --> 05:19.620
I WAS KINDA HOPING YOU'D HAVE
TO REPAY THIS ONE NEVER.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.893
(gate buzzes)

05:22.893 --> 05:25.896
THANKS FOR HAVING THEM
LET ME OUT OF A SIDE GATE.

05:25.896 --> 05:28.459
WASN'T READY TO FACE
MY FICKLE PUBLIC YET.

05:28.459 --> 05:31.462
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK
AMONG THE LIVING, NOLAN.

05:31.462 --> 05:33.063
TOOK A LOT LONGER
THAN EXPECTED

05:33.063 --> 05:35.005
FOR THE FAIL-SAFE
I INVENTED IN CARRION

05:35.005 --> 05:36.667
TO FERRET OUT ALL
THE INITIATIVE NUMBERS,

05:36.667 --> 05:37.738
EXONERATE ME.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.571
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THAT IT DID,

05:40.571 --> 05:42.673
AND LET'S NEVER SAY THE WORDS
"CARRION" OR "INITIATIVE"

05:42.673 --> 05:44.014
EVER AGAIN.

05:44.014 --> 05:45.416
AMEN TO THAT.

05:45.416 --> 05:47.878
SPEAKING OF...

05:47.878 --> 05:50.381
HOW GO
THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT?

05:50.381 --> 05:53.053
I'M DOING MY BEST
TO AVOID SETTING A DATE

05:53.053 --> 05:55.456
WHILE DANIEL
LOOKS FOR A JOB.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.128
AND I GUESS I CAN SYMPATHIZE
SINCE, WELL,

05:58.128 --> 06:01.131
NOLCORP HAS GONE THE WAY
OF THE FLIP PHONE.

06:01.131 --> 06:04.064
SO... WHAT'D I MISS?

06:04.064 --> 06:06.437
JACK WAS ABOUT
TO SHOOT CONRAD?

06:06.437 --> 06:08.469
YES, NOLAN.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.401
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT MOVE
TO STOP HIM.

06:10.401 --> 06:12.372
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW, BUT NO,

06:12.372 --> 06:17.408
JUST GOING ALL BIRTH NAME
ON HIM--WOW.

06:17.408 --> 06:18.409
WAIT. YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM
I WAS PRESIDENT

06:18.409 --> 06:19.810
OF THE INNER CIRCLE,
DID YOU?

06:19.810 --> 06:21.081
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.853
AFTER DECLAN'S FUNERAL,
HE PACKED UP THE STOWAWAY

06:22.853 --> 06:24.415
AND LEFT WITH CARL.

06:24.415 --> 06:26.386
I GUESS
THAT'S FOR THE BEST.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.460
I DON'T WANNA RISK LOSING ONE
OF THE FEW FRIENDS I HAVE LEFT.

06:29.460 --> 06:30.721
I'M SORRY, NOLAN.

06:30.721 --> 06:32.092
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED IN MY PLANS.

06:32.092 --> 06:35.426
UM... YEAH, NO DICE, EMS.

06:35.426 --> 06:37.728
I WILL BE BY YOUR SIDE
UNTIL WE HAVE TAKEN DOWN

06:37.728 --> 06:41.001
EVERYONE WHO WRONGED
YOUR FATHER...

06:41.001 --> 06:42.533
AND ME.

06:44.575 --> 06:46.507
ESPECIALLY IF THIS IS
YOUR NEW SUMMER PAD.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.008
NOT MINE.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.480
(keys jangle)

06:49.480 --> 06:50.881
FOR SERIOUS?

06:50.881 --> 06:55.486
IF MEMORY SERVES,
I STILL OWE YOU A HOUSE.

06:55.486 --> 06:57.948
(chuckles) HMM.

06:57.948 --> 07:02.422
I GUESS SOMETIMES
PAYBACK'S NOT A BITCH.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.555
ALTHOUGH I IMAGINE
IT WILL BE

07:04.555 --> 07:09.029
FOR NEW YORK'S FIRST
AND WORST FAMILY.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.502
WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON TAP?

07:11.502 --> 07:14.204
A LONG SUMMER OF FUN.

07:14.204 --> 07:17.868
BEGINNING WITH TOMORROW'S
MEMORIAL DAY PARTY?

07:17.868 --> 07:20.140
AND IF EVERYTHING GOES
AS PLANNED,

07:20.140 --> 07:22.743
THAT'LL BE THE LAST ONE
THE GRAYSONS EVER ATTEND.

07:22.743 --> 07:33.524
(clink)

07:36.957 --> 07:38.158
(Conrad)
ONE DAY BEFORE ITS DEBUT,

07:38.158 --> 07:40.130
AND YOU'RE STILL MISSING
THE DEPTH IN MY EYES.

07:40.130 --> 07:43.233
ARCTIC POOLS, LAILA.
ARCTIC POOLS.

07:43.233 --> 07:45.836
(telephone ringing in distance)

07:45.836 --> 07:47.898
(sighs)

07:47.898 --> 07:49.670
YOU KNOW WHAT?
(stammers) UH...

07:49.670 --> 07:51.101
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

07:51.101 --> 07:52.172
THANK YOU.

07:52.172 --> 07:56.677
(indistinct conversations)

07:56.677 --> 07:58.909
FINALLY ACHIEVING
THE IMMORTALITY

07:58.909 --> 08:00.250
YOU'VE ALWAYS HOPED FOR.

08:00.250 --> 08:04.555
OH, NO, MY LEGACY LIES
IN THE WORK I'M GETTING DONE.

08:04.555 --> 08:08.218
IT'S A SPRINGBOARD BOTH
FOR THE STATE'S REHABILITATION

08:08.218 --> 08:11.491
AND MY ASCENSION
TO THE HIGHER OFFICES

08:11.491 --> 08:12.963
TO WHICH I'M DESTINED.

08:12.963 --> 08:16.496
TO THAT EXTENT, I'VE BEEN GOING
OVER THE SPECS OF THE PARTY

08:16.496 --> 08:19.269
MS. THORNE'S BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO
THROW IN YOUR MOTHER'S DORMANCY,

08:19.269 --> 08:21.271
AND WHILE SECURITY
IS ACCEPTABLE

08:21.271 --> 08:23.874
FOR A TYPICAL
HAMPTONS HOBNOB,

08:23.874 --> 08:26.176
IT'S SORELY INADEQUATE FOR
A FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,

08:26.176 --> 08:29.540
SO WE WILL BE ADDING
HANDHELD METAL DETECTORS

08:29.540 --> 08:32.212
AND X-RAY SCANNERS
AT ALL THE ENTRANCES.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.184
IS THAT WHY
YOU CALLED ME HERE?

08:35.184 --> 08:36.746
TO MAKE ME HEAD
OF YOUR SECURITY DETAIL?

08:36.746 --> 08:37.788
(chuckles)
I MEAN, I KNOW I NEED A JOB,

08:37.788 --> 08:39.519
BUT I'M NOT THAT DESPERATE.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.751
I DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE.

08:40.751 --> 08:43.222
THIS IS A DOSSIER
FOR RICE & HAWTHORNE,

08:43.222 --> 08:45.295
WHERE A PRIMO V.P. POSITION
AWAITS.

08:45.295 --> 08:47.828
I SAID, DAD, HEDGE FUNDS
AREN'T FOR ME ANYMORE,

08:47.828 --> 08:49.600
AND NEITHER
ARE YOUR CONNECTIONS.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.532
IT'S TIME TO MAKE SOMETHING
OF MYSELF.
 (cell phone ringing)

08:52.532 --> 08:56.006
WELL, AS LONG AS IT ISN'T
KICKSTARTING A POETRY REVIEW.

08:56.006 --> 08:58.308
OH, THAT'D BE
MY CHIEF OF STAFF,

08:58.308 --> 09:02.272
WHO WORKED AT
RICE & HAWTHORNE, BY THE WAY.
 (beep)

09:02.272 --> 09:05.846
SCOTTY,
WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD?

09:05.846 --> 09:08.619
(buoy bell clanging,
sea birds calling)

09:29.169 --> 09:31.141
THERE ARE MUCH NICER PLACES
TO GET A DRINK.

09:31.141 --> 09:33.974
SOME OF THEM ARE EVEN OPEN.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.106
JUST...

09:36.106 --> 09:37.307
GETTING A LITTLE FRESH AIR.

09:37.307 --> 09:39.279
MILES AWAY
FROM YOUR PENTHOUSE

09:39.279 --> 09:42.582
AND THE VENUE OF THE PARTY
THAT YOU DIDN'T INVITE ME TO.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.755
I'M SORRY, ASHLEY.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN TOWN.

09:44.755 --> 09:46.617
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, EMILY.

09:46.617 --> 09:48.318
I THOUGHT YOU HAD POWER,
ASHLEY.

09:48.318 --> 09:51.291
NO. WHAT I HAD WAS A DEAL
WITH CONRAD

09:51.291 --> 09:54.795
TO PAY ME TO FORGET
ABOUT ALL THE CRAP HE'S DONE.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.727
BUT THAT WELL HAS DRIED UP,

09:56.727 --> 10:00.330
AND SINCE THERE'S NO UPSIDE
TO ME BARKING ABOUT IT,

10:00.330 --> 10:02.032
I'M COMING TO YOU.

10:02.032 --> 10:03.934
FOR WHAT?

10:03.934 --> 10:05.305
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE.

10:05.305 --> 10:10.280
I SAW THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYE
THE NIGHT OF THE ELECTION.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.912
YOU WEREN'T THERE
TO SAVE CONRAD'S LIFE.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.684
YOU WERE THERE
TO SAVE JACK'S.

10:13.684 --> 10:16.717
AND SINCE I KNOW HOW YOU
STILL FEEL ABOUT HIM,

10:16.717 --> 10:19.189
I WILL STOP AT NOTHING
TO EXPOSE YOU TO THE GRAYSONS

10:19.189 --> 10:21.621
FOR THE FRAUD
YOU REALLY ARE.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.924
THAT'S NOT HOW IT HAPPENED,
ASHLEY.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.827
AND TO BE HONEST,
YOU SEEM A LITTLE DESPERATE.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.098
I'LL BE AT YOUR PARTY
TOMORROW,

10:28.098 --> 10:31.131
AND YOU CAN INTRODUCE ME
TO SOME MEN OF STANDING.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.632
SOUND LIKE A PLAN?

10:32.632 --> 10:33.764
IS THAT ALL?

10:33.764 --> 10:36.636
NO.
WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.980
(indistinct conversations)

10:54.755 --> 10:59.259
(speaks French)

10:59.259 --> 11:02.362
"I WANT
A VIRGIN SCREWDRIVER."

11:02.362 --> 11:04.234
(glass thuds)
 MARGAUX?

11:04.234 --> 11:07.097
(chuckles)
 I MESS UP ONE ORDER
WHEN I'M 14,

11:07.097 --> 11:09.039
AND YOU'LL NEVER LET ME
LIVE IT DOWN.

11:09.039 --> 11:12.843
YOU SEEMED VERY HAPPY
WITH YOUR ORANGE JUICE.

11:12.843 --> 11:14.775
SUCH A NICE SURPRISE
TO SEE YOU.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.306
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

11:16.306 --> 11:18.078
OH, WELL,
SINCE BEFORE YOU KNEW

11:18.078 --> 11:22.252
HOW TO PROPERLY ASK
FOR A DRINK. (chuckles)
 MM.

11:22.252 --> 11:23.453
HMM, LIGHT SUMMER READING?

11:23.453 --> 11:27.217
YEAH, I WISH. LOOKING FOR
MY NEXT CAREER MOVE.

11:27.217 --> 11:28.288
I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW

11:28.288 --> 11:31.391
MAKING MONEY
IS A JOB DESCRIPTION.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.294
BUT OF COURSE, YOUR KIND
ARE A NECESSARY EVIL

11:34.294 --> 11:37.367
AS I'M HERE TO BE OGLED
BY YET ANOTHER INVESTOR.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.699
THAT COULD BE 'CAUSE
YOU'RE NOT WEARING A BRA...

11:39.699 --> 11:41.932
OR BECAUSE
BOYS NEVER GROW UP.

11:41.932 --> 11:43.373
YOU DIDN'T CATCH ME LOOKING,
DID YOU?

11:43.373 --> 11:44.835
BUT YOU STILL NOTICED.

11:44.835 --> 11:46.837
(chuckles)
I'M ACTUALLY LATE.

11:46.837 --> 11:47.908
BUT LET'S CATCH UP TOMORROW

11:47.908 --> 11:49.910
AT YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S
MEMORIAL DAY PARTY.

11:49.910 --> 11:53.413
YOU'RE COMING?
 I TRY NOT TO MISS A CHANCE
TO SEE AMERICAN CULTURE--

11:53.413 --> 11:55.715
ELUSIVE AS IT IS.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.347
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

11:57.347 --> 11:58.749
YES.
 ALL RIGHT.

11:58.749 --> 12:03.824
UH, MARGAUX...
EMILY'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.026
SHE'S MY FIANCéE.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.859
OH, MY MISTAKE.
I CAN NEVER KEEP UP.

12:08.859 --> 12:10.300
(chuckles)

12:10.300 --> 12:14.865
(sea birds calling,
waves crashing)

12:21.311 --> 12:24.144
EMILY?

12:24.144 --> 12:26.276
I SAW THE DOORS OPEN.
I WAS HOPING YOU WERE HOME.

12:26.276 --> 12:30.380
OH, MY GOSH. LOOK AT YOU.
YOU LOOK SO DIFFERENT.

12:30.380 --> 12:32.452
THANK YOU. I LIKE IT.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.455
AND YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN
IN THE CITY TOO LONG.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.228
YOU'RE MISSING
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SUNSET.
 (chuckles)

12:38.228 --> 12:40.961
(sighs) OH, WOW.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.493
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T
CUT YOUR TRIP SHORT

12:43.493 --> 12:46.196
JUST SO YOU COULD MAKE
MY MEMORIAL DAY PARTY.

12:46.196 --> 12:48.768
NO, I'M HOME BECAUSE
MY LOVELY MOTHER

12:48.768 --> 12:50.440
HAS LEFT ME NO OTHER
MONETARY OPTION.

12:50.440 --> 12:53.203
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

12:53.203 --> 12:54.805
SEEN HER?

12:54.805 --> 12:57.307
I ALMOST CAUGHT LADY CHATTERLY
WITH HER LOVER.
 HER LOVER?

12:57.307 --> 12:59.779
MORE LIKE BOY TOY,
ACTUALLY.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.083
I THINK HE'S EVEN
STAYING AT THE HOUSE.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.086
(piano playing
Debussy's "Clair de Lune")

13:11.822 --> 13:13.223
(door closes)

13:13.223 --> 13:16.226
♪♪♪

13:30.080 --> 13:35.385
♪♪♪

13:35.385 --> 13:37.387
(stops playing)

13:37.387 --> 13:39.349
(sighs) BEAUTIFUL.

13:39.349 --> 13:41.051
EMILY.

13:41.051 --> 13:44.494
IT'S A SHAME YOU STILL FEEL
THE NEED TO DROP BY UNANNOUNCED.

13:44.494 --> 13:47.497
HMM. HAD YOU CALLED
BEFOREHAND,

13:47.497 --> 13:49.229
I WOULD HAVE INVITED YOU
TO DINNER.

13:49.229 --> 13:53.163
I HAD THE MOST MARVELOUS
 SALAD OF ASPARAGUS

13:53.163 --> 13:55.235
I PICKED FRESH FROM THE GARDEN
THIS MORNING.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.938
HMM. WELL, I'M SORRY
I MISSED IT.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.910
WELL, I SHOULD BOX SOME
FOR YOU...

13:59.910 --> 14:01.241
ALONG WITH ANY ANIMOSITY

14:01.241 --> 14:03.944
YOU AND I MAY HAVE
SHOWN EACH OTHER.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.416
LET'S ALLOW THE PAST
TO REMAIN SO, SHALL WE?

14:06.416 --> 14:09.019
THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHY I'M HERE.

14:09.019 --> 14:11.922
I HAVEN'T RECEIVED
YOUR R.S.V.P. FOR TOMORROW.
 (pouring tea)

14:11.922 --> 14:13.253
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT
WE'RE UNVEILING

14:13.253 --> 14:15.325
YOUR HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT,
AND I WORRY THAT YOUR ABSENCE

14:15.325 --> 14:16.927
WILL...
 (cup clatters)

14:16.927 --> 14:18.858
(inhales deeply)
SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.160
OH, WELL,
I HAVE LITTLE CONCERN

14:20.160 --> 14:22.132
OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF ME
AT THE MOMENT.

14:22.132 --> 14:25.235
WELL, THEN THIS PROBABLY WON'T
MATTER TO YOU EITHER, BUT...

14:25.235 --> 14:29.299
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
I RAN INTO ASHLEY.

14:29.299 --> 14:32.472
SHE TOLD ME YOU WERE
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

14:35.305 --> 14:36.576
AND SHE'S SO DESPERATE,
SHE THOUGHT

14:36.576 --> 14:39.109
SHE'D BLACKMAIL ME TO PROTECT
YOUR SECRET. (scoffs)

14:39.109 --> 14:41.151
AND YOU CAME TO WARN ME.

14:41.151 --> 14:42.412
WELL, THAT'S VERY KIND.
(chuckles)

14:42.412 --> 14:45.655
WELL, SUFFICE IT TO SAY,
THAT HER FACTS

14:45.655 --> 14:47.887
ARE AS ILL-CONCEIVED
AS HER INTENTIONS.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.320
OH, I DON'T DOUBT
THAT SHE'S WRONG, VICTORIA.

14:50.320 --> 14:54.564
MM. BUT...

14:54.564 --> 14:56.967
I WILL SAY THAT
YOU SEEM HAPPY.

14:56.967 --> 15:00.430
(chuckles)
 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT

15:00.430 --> 15:03.603
SOMEONE ELSE
HAS LIFTED YOUR SPIRITS?

15:03.603 --> 15:06.336
LIKE... PATRICK?

15:06.336 --> 15:09.239
(laughs)

15:09.239 --> 15:12.082
OH, OF ALL PEOPLE,
YOU SEE RIGHT THROUGH ME.

15:12.082 --> 15:17.687
YES. HE SHOWED UP THE NIGHT
OF CONRAD'S ELECTION.

15:17.687 --> 15:19.249
THOUGH I HAVEN'T
LAID EYES ON HIM

15:19.249 --> 15:22.622
SINCE HE WAS 6 MONTHS OLD,

15:22.622 --> 15:24.924
I HAD NO DOUBT
THAT HE WAS MY FIRSTBORN.

15:27.397 --> 15:30.630
HE'S CHANGED MY HEART.

15:30.630 --> 15:34.304
WELL, I SHOULD HEAD BACK
TO THE CITY...
 (saucer clinks)

15:34.304 --> 15:37.367
BACK TO THE MAN
WHO CHANGED MINE. (chuckles)

15:37.367 --> 15:40.170
I TRUST THAT YOU'LL KEEP
THIS INFORMATION TO YOURSELF.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.212
THEN I TRUST
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

15:42.212 --> 15:46.016
I THINK BOTH YOU AND I
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE

15:46.016 --> 15:48.278
OF PROTECTING THE SANCTITY
OF THE FAMILY.

15:48.278 --> 15:52.022
AS MUCH AS WE HAVE
TO DEAL WITH THOSE WHO WON'T.

15:52.022 --> 15:54.484
BYE.

16:05.435 --> 16:07.097
WELL, I THINK SHE'S GONNA
LOVE MEETING YOU, JORGE.

16:07.097 --> 16:08.238
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
 (siren wailing,
horn honks in distance)

16:08.238 --> 16:10.270
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.
THANKS. BYE.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.741
(cell phone beeps)

16:14.044 --> 16:15.475
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU GET IN
LAST NIGHT.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.079
UM... I GOT A LATE START
LEAVING THE HAMPTONS--

16:19.079 --> 16:21.011
DROPPED IN ON YOUR MOM
FOR A GOODWILL CALL.

16:21.011 --> 16:22.752
YEAH? AND HOW IS THE WITCH?

16:22.752 --> 16:25.585
SHE ACTUALLY SAID
SHE'D COME TODAY.
 REALLY?

16:25.585 --> 16:28.488
SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALL DOING
BETTER APART THAN TOGETHER.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.490
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, DANIEL.
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

16:30.490 --> 16:33.123
YOU KNOW,
YOUR ROSY OPTIMISM

16:33.123 --> 16:36.426
ALMOST MAKES ME FORGET
MY FAMILY FORTUNE'S BEEN STOLEN,

16:36.426 --> 16:38.068
AND I'M UNEMPLOYED.

16:38.068 --> 16:39.529
LOOK, WE CAN WORRY ABOUT THAT
TOMORROW.

16:39.529 --> 16:43.373
TODAY, LET'S JUST RELAX
AND TRY TO ENJOY OURSELVES.

16:43.373 --> 16:46.506
NOT IF OUR ESTEEMED GOVERNOR
HAS ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT.

16:46.506 --> 16:50.340
HE'S AMPING SECURITY--
X-RAY SCANNERS, THE WHOLE NINE.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.742
SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT
SNEAKING IN ANYTHING EXPLOSIVE.

16:52.742 --> 16:54.584
MM. WHY?

16:54.584 --> 16:55.745
CLAIMS IT'S 'CAUSE
HE'S ENTERTAINING

16:55.745 --> 16:57.687
A PRESIDENTIAL RUN.

16:57.687 --> 17:00.320
OR HIS EGO.
 (chuckles)
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE?

17:03.423 --> 17:04.454
(cup clacks)

17:04.454 --> 17:07.457
(police radio chatter)

17:09.759 --> 17:12.762
(indistinct conversations)

17:14.464 --> 17:18.037
(chuckles) DAD!
 THERE'S MY LITTLE...

17:18.037 --> 17:20.410
WOMAN, IT WOULD SEEM.

17:20.410 --> 17:23.073
EUROPE DID WONDERS.
 (chuckles)

17:23.073 --> 17:25.145
(chuckles)
 (sighs)

17:25.145 --> 17:26.246
YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED IT.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.619
WHY DON'T YOU TELL
YOUR OVERWORKED DAD

17:29.619 --> 17:32.422
YOUR FAVORITE MOMENT?

17:32.422 --> 17:35.655
THAT'S EASY. I'D JUST COME OUT
OF THE REINA SOFIA,

17:35.655 --> 17:37.427
WHICH WAS LIFE-CHANGING.

17:37.427 --> 17:40.630
AND I SEE A NEWSSTAND
SELLING THE "HERALD-TRIBUNE"

17:40.630 --> 17:42.392
WITH YOU ON THE COVER.

17:42.392 --> 17:44.664
AND I WAS SO PROUD, I TURNED
TO THE STRANGER NEXT TO ME

17:44.664 --> 17:47.267
AND SAID, "THAT'S MY DAD."

17:47.267 --> 17:49.099
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE

17:49.099 --> 17:51.341
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO HEAR THAT.

17:51.341 --> 17:52.672
I'M PROUD OF YOU, TOO,
KITTEN,

17:52.672 --> 17:55.745
ESPECIALLY AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

17:55.745 --> 18:00.180
CHARLOTTE? YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT WE HAD A VISITOR.
 (Conrad) WELL...

18:00.180 --> 18:05.115
IF IT ISN'T SOUTH HAMPTON'S
MOST RAVISHING SHUT-IN.

18:05.115 --> 18:08.318
IT APPEARS MONASTIC LIFE
SUITS YOU, VICTORIA.

18:08.318 --> 18:11.561
SO I IMAGINE SUCH ANONYMOUS
CONTENTMENT MUST SEEM ODD

18:11.561 --> 18:13.863
TO A MAN WHO HAS TO SERVICE...

18:13.863 --> 18:15.625
20 MILLION PEOPLE.

18:15.625 --> 18:18.097
OH, YOU KNOW, MY CONSTITUENTS
ARE CLAMORING FOR YOU, TOO,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.200
MY DEAR.
 THAT'S A DIN
I'M PREPARED TO QUELL.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.203
AS I'M PLANNING ON COMING
TO THE UNVEILING TODAY.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.175
THAT'S A TIMELY
CHANGE OF HEART.

18:25.175 --> 18:28.208
MAY I PRESUME THAT YOU'LL
ALSO BE REPRESENTING MY OFFICE

18:28.208 --> 18:30.510
IN BINGHAMTON FOR THE TRANSFER
STATION OPENING NEXT WEEK?

18:30.510 --> 18:33.513
MM, BABY STEPS, CONRAD.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.685
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE PARTY, DAD.
 YEAH.

18:38.748 --> 18:40.450
LOOK, I HOPE YOU CAN RESPECT
THAT I NEED

18:40.450 --> 18:41.891
TO KEEP THE TRAPPINGS
OF THIS OFFICE

18:41.891 --> 18:43.653
FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE--

18:43.653 --> 18:45.495
NOT ONLY FOR
THE GOOD I'M DOING,

18:45.495 --> 18:48.458
BUT LEST YOU FORGET,
IT'S OUR SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.160
OH, BELIEVE ME.
I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE

18:50.160 --> 18:52.202
THAN TO SEE YOU REMAIN
AT THE STATE HOUSE.
 OH.

18:52.202 --> 18:54.133
ESPECIALLY AFTER
THE INEXCUSABLE THINGS YOU DID

18:54.133 --> 18:55.605
WHILE LIVING HERE.

18:55.605 --> 18:57.136
YES, ALL IN MY ENDEAVOR
TO KEEP US ALIVE--

18:57.136 --> 19:00.139
A DEBT YOU CAN NOW REPAY
BY GOING TO BINGHAMTON.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.772
TO CHRISTEN A LANDFILL?
I THINK NOT.

19:02.772 --> 19:04.744
THEN YOU LEAVE ME
WITH ONLY ONE OPTION.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.446
AND WHAT'S THAT?

19:06.446 --> 19:09.879
AS OF TOMORROW,
GRAYSON MANOR IS ON THE MARKET.

19:12.582 --> 19:16.586
CONRAD'S INCREASED SECURITY
AT EVERY ENTRANCE

19:16.586 --> 19:18.828
AND FOR WHAT I'M PLANNING
FOR THE GRAYSONS,

19:18.828 --> 19:22.232
LET'S JUST SAY,
I HAVE TO BRING IT IN WITH ME.

19:22.232 --> 19:24.834
MM, SO MUCH FOR NESTING.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.836
I NEED YOU TO HACK
THIS X-RAY MACHINE.

19:26.836 --> 19:29.699
CYBER-REVENGING HAS BROUGHT ME
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

19:29.699 --> 19:31.741
SO FOR NOW, I'M DONE
WITH CODING, CAMMING,

19:31.741 --> 19:34.774
PROGRAMMING, AND HACKING.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.847
I'M NOLAN TWO POINT... NO.

19:38.908 --> 19:42.682
BUT... THERE MAY BE A WAY.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.913
HOW?

19:43.913 --> 19:45.285
TRUST ME.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.618
I ALWAYS TRUST YOU,
DON'T I?

19:48.618 --> 19:50.290
(cell phone chimes)

19:50.290 --> 19:53.423
I'VE GOT MORE
UNPACKING TO DO.
 FINE.

19:53.423 --> 19:58.197
(cell phone beeps)
 AND I'M NOT
THE ONLY ONE UNPACKING.

19:58.197 --> 20:02.201
JACK'S BACK.

20:06.706 --> 20:11.210
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
IF I LET MYSELF IN.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.344
MY FAMILY IS PAYING
FOR THIS SUITE, AFTER ALL.

20:14.344 --> 20:15.885
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:15.885 --> 20:17.447
EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU.

20:17.447 --> 20:19.549
THOUGH I GUESS I KNOW WHAT
YOU WERE DOING AT MY HOUSE.

20:19.549 --> 20:20.620
CHARLOTTE,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.552
AND WHEN I TELL MY FATHER
ABOUT YOU,

20:22.552 --> 20:24.354
HE'LL SQUASH YOU
LIKE A BUG.

20:24.354 --> 20:25.725
YOUR FATHER KNOWS I EXIST.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.898
WHO THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

20:28.898 --> 20:29.999
I'M YOUR BROTHER.

20:29.999 --> 20:32.262
(whispers) WHAT?

20:32.262 --> 20:34.264
PATRICK.

20:34.264 --> 20:35.505
I'M YOUR BROTHER.

20:35.505 --> 20:36.706
WELL, I GUESS IT'S TYPICAL.

20:36.706 --> 20:37.867
DANIEL AND I GO AWAY
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS,

20:37.867 --> 20:40.009
AND MY MOTHER
BUYS OUR REPLACEMENT.

20:40.009 --> 20:41.511
AND I'M SORRY YOU HAVE SUCH
A LOW OPINION OF YOUR MOTHER.

20:41.511 --> 20:44.344
SHE'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT GRACIOUS, GENEROUS, KIND.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.877
WELL, IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE JUST GONNA

20:47.877 --> 20:51.020
ENJOY THE PERKS
WITHOUT THE MISERY,

20:51.020 --> 20:52.452
YOU'RE WRONG.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.925
MY MOTHER WILL DRAW YOU IN
AND DESTROY YOU.

20:55.925 --> 20:59.589
IT'S WHAT SHE DOES.

20:59.589 --> 21:01.931
AND IF SHE DOESN'T,
I WILL.

21:01.931 --> 21:03.733
CHARLOTTE.
 (door opens)

21:05.935 --> 21:08.267
(sea birds calling)

21:17.877 --> 21:19.679
JACK?

21:29.619 --> 21:32.622
(footsteps descending)

21:32.622 --> 21:34.464
YOU WANT A DRINK?

21:37.727 --> 21:40.730
NO, THANKS.

21:40.730 --> 21:41.931
I WANT A DRINK.

21:41.931 --> 21:44.534
(bottle cap clacks)

21:44.534 --> 21:48.978
(bottle clinks)
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.
(sighs)
 I...

21:52.782 --> 21:56.446
(glass clatters)
 WHERE YOU BEEN?

21:56.446 --> 21:59.849
I WAS INTRODUCING MY SON
TO HIS EXTENDED FAMILY.

21:59.849 --> 22:01.951
HOW IS CARL?

22:01.951 --> 22:04.323
HE'S GOOD.

22:07.697 --> 22:11.030
(sighs)

22:11.030 --> 22:16.766
I AM SO SORRY
THAT I LIED TO YOU--

22:16.766 --> 22:19.038
THAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU
THE TRUTH IN THE FIRST PLACE.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.841
I...
 I KNOW.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.813
WELL, I THINK ABOUT ALL
THE OPPORTUNITIES YOU HAD

22:23.813 --> 22:28.378
TO TELL ME... THAT NIGHT
UNDER THE FIREWORKS,

22:28.378 --> 22:29.979
THE NIGHT SAMMY DIED.
 I WANTED TO.

22:29.979 --> 22:31.951
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.653
SO I ASK MYSELF WHY--

22:33.653 --> 22:36.926
WHY WAS THIS
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

22:36.926 --> 22:40.029
THEN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO,
I...

22:40.029 --> 22:41.661
I WAS LEAVING MY UNCLE'S PLACE
IN PITTSBURGH,

22:41.661 --> 22:44.864
AND CARL WAS ASLEEP
IN THE BACK.

22:44.864 --> 22:48.968
I LOOKED IN THE REARVIEW,
AND... (sighs)

22:48.968 --> 22:50.900
JUST AS HE WAS WAKING UP,
HIS EYES CAUGHT MINE.

22:50.900 --> 22:54.043
AND...

22:54.043 --> 22:55.905
HE JUST SPRANG TO LIFE.

22:57.747 --> 23:02.882
AND IN THAT MOMENT, I SAW...

23:02.882 --> 23:07.056
THE LOVE THAT
A CHILD HAS FOR THEIR FATHER.

23:07.056 --> 23:11.591
AND I UNDERSTOOD...

23:11.591 --> 23:14.494
WHY YOU'RE DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.995
(sniffs)

23:15.995 --> 23:19.398
AND WHY YOU TOLD ME
WHEN YOU DID--

23:19.398 --> 23:20.900
TO SAVE ME.

23:24.974 --> 23:27.977
(both panting)

23:38.788 --> 23:42.622
(moans)

23:42.622 --> 23:44.954
(pants and sniffs)
 (panting)

23:48.658 --> 23:51.731
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW I FELT
ABOUT YOU TILL THIS MOMENT.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.967
AND I'M SORRY.

23:57.967 --> 24:01.210
I JUST DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

24:01.210 --> 24:04.914
(gasps)

24:04.914 --> 24:07.817
I'LL KEEP YOUR SECRET...

24:07.817 --> 24:09.849
BUT IT'S JUST
ME AND CARL NOW.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.021
LEAVE US ALONE.

24:30.940 --> 24:32.772
(knock on door)

24:32.772 --> 24:35.004
(chuckles)

24:35.004 --> 24:37.547
(gasps) OH.

24:37.547 --> 24:40.209
OH, YOU KNOW, IT WAS SO STRANGE
COMING DOWNSTAIRS THIS MORNING

24:40.209 --> 24:41.651
AND NOT SEEING YOU
AT BREAKFAST.

24:41.651 --> 24:42.582
AND OBVIOUSLY,
YOU FELT THE SAME

24:42.582 --> 24:44.554
SINCE YOU ASKED ME
TO POP BY.

24:44.554 --> 24:47.517
AND I COULD USE
A HAPPY MOMENT. (chuckles)

24:47.517 --> 24:49.919
YOU LOOK--WELL, YOU LOOK
INCREDIBLE. (chuckles)

24:49.919 --> 24:51.621
OH, IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I THREW TOGETHER

24:51.621 --> 24:53.663
FOR EMILY'S PARTY
THIS AFTERNOON.

24:53.663 --> 24:54.924
(chuckles)

24:58.628 --> 25:01.000
(scoffs) WHAT'S THIS?

25:01.000 --> 25:05.034
OH, UM...

25:05.034 --> 25:07.076
THAT'S ACTUALLY--
THAT'S WHY I CALLED.

25:07.076 --> 25:09.508
UM, I CAN ONLY
CONSIDER MYSELF A FREELANCER

25:09.508 --> 25:12.882
IF I ACTUALLY PAINT
ON OCCASION. (chuckles)

25:12.882 --> 25:15.244
SO, UM, I'M GOING BACK HOME
TO THE CITY.

25:15.244 --> 25:17.246
SO YOU'RE LEAVING ME?
 (bag zips)

25:17.246 --> 25:20.219
OR WAS THAT YOUR PLAN
ALL ALONG?

25:20.219 --> 25:21.921
DRAWING ME IN,

25:21.921 --> 25:25.595
THEN ABANDON ME AS PAYBACK
FOR MY TRANSGRESSIONS?

25:27.657 --> 25:29.599
NO.

25:29.599 --> 25:31.100
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT KIND
OF PERSON WOULD DO THAT. I--

25:31.100 --> 25:33.162
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

25:33.162 --> 25:34.564
DID SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING?

25:37.136 --> 25:40.069
IT'S JUST TIME.
TIME FOR BOTH OF US.

25:40.069 --> 25:43.713
AND, UM...

25:43.713 --> 25:46.315
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.
I PROMISE.

25:53.683 --> 25:55.054
(whispers) BYE.

25:58.227 --> 26:01.090
(door opens and closes)

26:05.735 --> 26:09.138
(band playing swing jazz)

26:09.138 --> 26:10.269
(indistinct conversations)

26:10.269 --> 26:11.901
(machine beeps)

26:17.146 --> 26:21.150
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT'S BEEN
TWO YEARS SINCE WE MET?

26:21.150 --> 26:23.252
GOSH, IT FEELS LIKE
SO MUCH LONGER.

26:23.252 --> 26:24.654
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

26:24.654 --> 26:26.656
UH, JUST WATER
WOULD BE GREAT.

26:26.656 --> 26:27.757
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT.
 THANKS.

THANK YOU FOR
PICKING UP THE MANTLE

27:33.252 --> 27:35.985
AND LAUNCHING
THE SEASON OFF IN STYLE.

27:35.985 --> 27:38.427
I HOPE YOU SAY A FEW WORDS
AFTER MY DEDICATION TODAY.

27:38.427 --> 27:40.059
OH, I, UH, YOU KNOW,

27:40.059 --> 27:43.292
I MAY HAVE PREPARED
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

27:43.292 --> 27:46.796
AND YOU, TOO, VICTORIA?
 OH, I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT

27:46.796 --> 27:49.068

YOUR COMING OUT PARTY.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.239
WELL, AFTER A 6-MONTH ABSENCE,

27:50.239 --> 27:51.941
I DARESAY IT'S ALSO YOURS,
MY DEAR.

27:51.941 --> 27:53.672
YEAH, THEY'D ALL LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.806
TRUST ME, I HAVE VERY LITTLE
OF INTEREST TO SAY. (chuckles)

27:56.806 --> 28:00.049
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
ASHLEY HAS THAT PROBLEM.

28:00.049 --> 28:03.352
(both chuckle
and speak indistinctly)

28:05.384 --> 28:07.386
I'M GOING TO GO LOOK
FOR DANIEL.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.819
(man) GOVERNOR GRAYSON.

28:09.819 --> 28:11.721
OH.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:11.721 --> 28:12.822
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
(chuckles)

28:12.822 --> 28:16.025
DANIEL...
YOUR FAMILY ARRIVED.

28:16.025 --> 28:17.426
HUH, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU COULD PULL IT OFF,

28:17.426 --> 28:19.328
BUT THE GANG'S ALL HERE.

28:19.328 --> 28:22.331
UH, EM, I'D LIKE FOR YOU
TO MEET MARGAUX LeMARCHAL.

28:22.331 --> 28:25.374
OH, PASCAL LeMARCHAL'S
DAUGHTER. ENCHANTé.
 YES.

28:25.374 --> 28:27.877
I'M A HUGE FAN
OF ALL OF HIS PUBLICATIONS--

28:27.877 --> 28:29.008
ESPECIALLY "VOULEZ."
 MM.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.039
OH, THAT'S WHY
I'VE MOVED HERE--

28:30.039 --> 28:32.041
TO START
THE AMERICAN VERSION.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.813
A NEW MAGAZINE
IN THE DIGITAL AGE?

28:33.813 --> 28:35.084
EVEN WITH A STRONG BRAND
BEHIND IT,

28:35.084 --> 28:36.715
IT'S NOT AN EASY PROSPECT.

28:36.715 --> 28:40.750
WHICH IS WHY I'M DOING IT
AGAINST PASCAL'S WISHES.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.792
SOMETIMES IT NEEDS
CROSSING AN OCEAN

28:42.792 --> 28:44.794
TO GET OUT OF
A FATHER'S SHADOW.

28:44.794 --> 28:46.295
AND WHAT DO YOU DO?

28:46.295 --> 28:48.257
I MEAN, BESIDES
THROW LOVELY PARTIES.

28:48.257 --> 28:51.000
WELL, I WORK FOR A LOT
OF DIFFERENT CHARITIES,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.162
MAKING SURE PEOPLE
GET WHAT THEY DESERVE.

28:53.162 --> 28:54.363
(woman) AAH!

28:54.363 --> 28:57.006
(guests murmuring)
 (man) NOTIFY SECURITY.

28:57.006 --> 28:58.467
EXCUSE ME.

28:58.467 --> 29:03.272
(excited murmuring)

29:03.272 --> 29:04.443
(woman) OH!

29:07.316 --> 29:09.879
(excited murmuring continues)

29:09.879 --> 29:11.851
(parachute rustles)

29:11.851 --> 29:13.282
(radio chatter)
 (man) HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

29:13.282 --> 29:15.424
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.
 (Velcro rips)

29:15.424 --> 29:16.525
(guests gasp)

29:16.525 --> 29:18.527
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING,
NOLAN?

29:18.527 --> 29:21.360
I MEANT TO, UH, R.S.V.P.,
BUT, UH... (clicks tongue)

29:21.360 --> 29:23.963
WAS UNCEREMONIOUSLY DETAINED.

29:23.963 --> 29:28.467
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN SHOT,
MR. ROSS.
 OH...

29:28.467 --> 29:30.369
BEATS WAITING FOR
A DEATH SENTENCE, GOVERNOR.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.401
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

29:32.401 --> 29:34.543
YOU LOOK PIQUED, CONRAD.

29:34.543 --> 29:37.406
I CANNOT SUFFER ANY MORE
BAD PRESS

29:37.406 --> 29:40.249
DUE TO THAT FOOL.

29:40.249 --> 29:42.381
WELL, LET'S GET STRAIGHT
TO THE UNVEILING.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.784
REFOCUS THE CROWD.
 THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.457
(amplified voice)
TODAY WE UNVEIL THE PORTRAIT

29:48.457 --> 29:50.519
THAT WILL SERVE AS A REMEMBRANCE

29:50.519 --> 29:52.421
FOR ALL OF THE GOOD
THAT YOU'VE DONE

29:52.421 --> 29:54.563
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

29:54.563 --> 29:59.468
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I GIVE YOU...

29:59.468 --> 30:02.231
GOVERNOR CONRAD GRAYSON.
(chuckles)

30:02.231 --> 30:04.473
(murmuring and applause)

30:07.436 --> 30:10.009
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER

30:10.009 --> 30:13.012
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU
THE WARMEST OF WELCOMES

30:13.012 --> 30:17.416
FROM THIS LOVELY LOCATION.
AND FROM THE OFFICE...

30:21.050 --> 30:23.092
(chuckles)

30:23.092 --> 30:26.225
I'M--I'M SORRY.

30:26.225 --> 30:29.999
(guests murmuring)

30:29.999 --> 30:32.561
WE, UH...

30:34.333 --> 30:37.166
DAMN IT, WHAT IS THAT? UM...

30:37.166 --> 30:38.837
(murmuring continues)

30:38.837 --> 30:41.510
UH... (breathes heavily)

30:41.510 --> 30:43.172
(woman screams, guests gasp)

30:43.172 --> 30:46.275
(guests murmuring)
 (man) PLEASE STEP BACK.
IT'S OKAY.

30:50.619 --> 30:52.451
(siren wailing in distance)

30:52.451 --> 30:54.924
THE PRESS IS GETTING ANTSY.

30:54.924 --> 30:56.926
SOMEONE SHOULD PROBABLY
MAKE A STATEMENT.

30:56.926 --> 30:59.228
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL
WE HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

30:59.228 --> 31:00.429
(woman speaking indistinctly
 over P.A.)

31:00.429 --> 31:02.531
(door creaks)

31:02.531 --> 31:05.634
I WAS CONCERNED
AFTER YOUR SYNCOPE

31:05.634 --> 31:08.898
THAT YOUR COLLAPSE MAY HAVE
BEEN SOMETHING HYPOPERFUSIVE.

31:08.898 --> 31:10.269
SO I RAN A FULL PANEL.

31:10.269 --> 31:13.872
AND IT CAME BACK
WITH A C.A.G. SCORE OF 48.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.204
(monitor beeping steadily)

31:15.204 --> 31:17.206
I'M AFRAID YOU HAVE
HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE, GOVERNOR.

31:17.206 --> 31:19.608
(inhales deeply)

31:19.608 --> 31:22.551
(Charlotte) WHAT IS THAT?

31:22.551 --> 31:25.654
IT'S A NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE
WHERE ONE SLOWLY STARTS

31:25.654 --> 31:28.617
TO LOSE MOTOR SKILLS
AND MENTAL ACUITY.

31:28.617 --> 31:30.519
IT'S PROGRESSIVE.

31:30.519 --> 31:33.892
AND IT'S FATAL?
 NO.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.926
UH, YOU NEED TO GET TESTED, SON.
IT'S GENETIC.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.501
HOW... RAPID IS THE ONSET?

31:42.501 --> 31:44.203
(Dr. Velez)
DEPENDS ON THE PATIENT.

31:44.203 --> 31:47.006
YOU HAVE A HIGH-STRESS JOB,
GOVERNOR.
 NONSENSE.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.678
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED UNTIL
RETIREMENT WITH THIS DISEASE.

31:49.678 --> 31:51.640
YOU NEED TO CONSIDER
YOUR OPTIONS.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.645
SAY NOTHING, CONRAD,
UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.

31:56.645 --> 32:01.050
NOT EVEN TO YOUR STAFF.
DANIEL... BRIEF THE PRESS.

32:01.050 --> 32:02.521
MY FATHER WILL BE FINE.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.593
HE'S SUFFERING
 FROM SEVERE DEHYDRATION,

32:04.593 --> 32:06.155
BUT HE'LL BE BACK ON HIS FEET
 IN 24 HOURS,

32:06.155 --> 32:08.157
SO THAT'S ALL I GOT TO SAY.

32:08.157 --> 32:11.160
(reporters shouting questions)

32:16.105 --> 32:17.506
SORRY, MA'AM--
 NO, HE KNOWS ME.

32:17.506 --> 32:19.508
YEAH, SHE'S GOOD.

32:19.508 --> 32:21.370
(man) OKAY, GO AHEAD.

32:21.370 --> 32:22.641
HI.
 HI.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.474
I DO HOPE YOUR FATHER
WILL BE OKAY.

32:25.474 --> 32:28.047
AH, OUR FATHERS ARE NOTHING
IF NOT SURVIVORS.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.178
AH.

32:29.178 --> 32:30.319
I CAN SEE YOUR WORRY.

32:30.319 --> 32:32.151
BUT A COLLEAGUE IN PARIS
HAS HUNTINGTON'S,

32:32.151 --> 32:35.424
AND HE'S DOING WELL,
SO I KNOW CONRAD CAN FIGHT THIS.

32:35.424 --> 32:36.725
HOW--HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT MY DAD HAS?

32:36.725 --> 32:38.687
UM, WELL, I RECEIVED
A NEWS ALERT AS I WALKED UP...

32:38.687 --> 32:40.629
(reporters clamoring)
 QUOTING A SOURCE
CLOSE TO THE FAMILY,

32:40.629 --> 32:41.690
WHICH I ASSUMED WAS YOU.

32:41.690 --> 32:43.692
EXCUSE ME. I'M SORRY.

32:46.735 --> 32:49.568
OH, VICTORIA.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.100
HMM?

32:54.473 --> 32:58.977
(sighs)

32:58.977 --> 33:01.310
PATRICK'S LEFT ME.

33:01.310 --> 33:06.655
CONRAD'S DYING,
AND NOW... DANIEL MAY HAVE IT.

33:06.655 --> 33:09.258
YOU KNOW,
ALL WAS GOOD FOR A WHILE.

33:09.258 --> 33:10.719
NOW IT'S BEING TORN AWAY,

33:10.719 --> 33:13.592
AND I JUST HAVE TO SIT HERE
AND TAKE IT.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.595
WELL, SOMETIMES FORCES
BEYOND OUR CONTROL

33:16.595 --> 33:18.197
CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.

33:18.197 --> 33:21.570
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS...

33:21.570 --> 33:24.373
TOGETHER.

33:24.373 --> 33:25.574
DAD'S DIAGNOSIS IS OUT THERE.

33:25.574 --> 33:27.636
WHAT?

33:27.636 --> 33:29.708
APPARENTLY SOMEONE "CLOSE TO
THE FAMILY" WENT TO THE PRESS.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.182
I HATE TO SAY IT,

33:33.182 --> 33:36.245
BUT WITH CONRAD'S CONDITION
BEING PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE...

33:36.245 --> 33:39.618
HE HAS TO STEP DOWN.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.190
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HIM.

33:45.554 --> 33:47.456
WHO KNEW BESIDES US?

33:47.456 --> 33:48.627
ONLY DR. VELEZ.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.299
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT

33:50.299 --> 33:52.801
HE WOULD DESTROY HIS CAREER
OVER THIS.

33:52.801 --> 33:54.303
UNLESS HE WAS
A LITTLE TOO CANDID

33:54.303 --> 33:57.136
WITH SOMEONE
HE'S INTERESTED IN.

33:58.637 --> 34:01.610
AND SINCE ASHLEY
WANTS MONEY,

34:01.610 --> 34:03.772
I'M SURE SHE NETTED
A HANDSOME PAYDAY

34:03.772 --> 34:06.745
BY SELLING HER STORY
TO THE PRESS.

34:12.451 --> 34:13.822
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE

34:13.822 --> 34:17.626
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
TO CONRAD TODAY, AREN'T YOU?

34:17.626 --> 34:21.460
HE HAD NO RIGHT BEING GOVERNOR
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

34:21.460 --> 34:25.164
SO YOU ALMOST KILL HIM?

34:25.164 --> 34:27.065
ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT
YOU WERE STOPPING ME FROM DOING?

34:27.065 --> 34:30.699
I'M NOT KILLING ANYBODY, JACK,
BUT I WILL LET THEM SUFFER.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.672
THESE ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE
DOING TERRIBLE THINGS.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.643
THIS IS WHAT THEY DESERVE.

34:35.643 --> 34:39.408
DID AMANDA
GET WHAT SHE DESERVED?

34:39.408 --> 34:40.779
DID DECLAN?

34:40.779 --> 34:43.652
WILL I, ONCE THE GRAYSONS
START CONNECTING DOTS?

34:43.652 --> 34:44.753
'CAUSE THEY KNOW
WHAT AMANDA CLARKE

34:44.753 --> 34:45.853
WAS TRYING TO DO TO THEM.

34:45.853 --> 34:47.755
THEY JUST KILLED
THE WRONG GIRL.

34:47.755 --> 34:51.120
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.792
(sighs) FINISH THIS
BY THE END OF THE SUMMER,

34:53.792 --> 34:55.324
THEN LEAVE FOR GOOD.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.168
OR I'LL TELL EVERYONE
THE TRUTH.

35:34.433 --> 35:35.604
ASHLEY.

35:35.604 --> 35:37.606
I THOUGHT CONRAD
ASKED FOR ME.

35:37.606 --> 35:40.509
WELL, ONE OF YOUR MANY
MISCONCEPTIONS, MISS DAVENPORT.

35:40.509 --> 35:43.412
EMILY TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR PATHETIC ATTEMPT

35:43.412 --> 35:44.573
TO BLACKMAIL HER

35:44.573 --> 35:46.545
AND YOUR VENDETTA
AGAINST OUR FAMILY.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.617
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO EXPLAIN IT YOURSELF.

35:48.617 --> 35:51.550
WELL, EMILY OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T
TELL YOU THE FULL STORY,

35:51.550 --> 35:53.282
LIKE THE FACT
THAT JACK PORTER

35:53.282 --> 35:54.623
TRIED TO ASSASSINATE
YOUR HUSBAND

35:54.623 --> 35:56.485
THE NIGHT HE GOT ELECTED.

35:56.485 --> 35:58.857
AND WHO DO YOU THINK
GAVE HIM THE GUN?

35:58.857 --> 36:02.291
WELL, I ALSO KNOW THAT
CONRAD PLANTED THAT BOMB

36:02.291 --> 36:05.364
AT GRAYSON GLOBAL
AND LED JACK THERE TO DIE.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.666
WITH A TEXT MESSAGE SENT
FROM YOUR PHONE.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.338
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T USE YOUR PHONE
THIS TIME

36:09.338 --> 36:10.569
TO SELL CONRAD'S STORY
TO THE MEDIA.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.541
I DID NO SUCH THING.

36:12.541 --> 36:14.403
WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS TRY
TO SLEEP YOUR WAY TO THE TOP

36:14.403 --> 36:16.545
AFTER FAILING
AT A MYRIAD OF JOBS

36:16.545 --> 36:17.646
WE GAVE YOU OUT OF PITY.

36:17.646 --> 36:19.748
WELL, AT LEAST I TRIED
TO WORK FOR IT

36:19.748 --> 36:22.381
AS OPPOSED TO HAVING
EVERYTHING HANDED TO ME.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.582
THAT'S FUNNY. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH
YOU WANTED ME

36:23.582 --> 36:24.883
TO HAND EVERYTHING TO YOU.

36:24.883 --> 36:28.487
CONRAD'S LAST ACT IN OFFICE

36:28.487 --> 36:30.519
WAS TO REQUISITION
YOUR CELL RECORDS

36:30.519 --> 36:31.920
THAT PROVE, IN FACT,
THAT YOU ATTEMPTED

36:31.920 --> 36:34.493
TO LURE JACK TO HIS DEATH.

36:34.493 --> 36:38.697
GET ON THAT PLANE.
GO BACK TO CROYDEN.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.768

36:39.768 --> 36:41.770

36:41.770 --> 36:43.532

36:43.532 --> 36:45.534
YOU TWO ARE EVIL.

36:45.534 --> 36:48.977

LIKE IT OR NOT, IS FAMILY.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.546

37:27.546 --> 37:30.419

ABOUT THIS DISEASE.

37:30.419 --> 37:33.422
PARANOIA.
FACIAL TREMORS.

37:33.422 --> 37:34.653

SERIOUSLY ROUGH WATERS

37:40.959 --> 37:43.892
UNTIL, UH...

37:46.765 --> 37:49.598
UNTIL HE...

37:49.598 --> 37:51.700
(sighs)

37:55.374 --> 37:57.005
THEN LET'S GET MARRIED

37:57.005 --> 37:59.578
BEFORE THE END
OF THE SUMMER.

38:03.582 --> 38:04.983
FOR MY DAD'S SAKE.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.515
YEAH.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.518
THAT MEANS A LOT.

38:09.518 --> 38:10.759

38:37.846 --> 38:40.318
I'M GONNA GO FOR A SWIM

38:40.318 --> 38:42.751
BUT LET YOUR FAMILY KNOW.

38:42.751 --> 38:45.754
AT LEAST SOMETHING GOOD
HAPPENED TODAY.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.804

38:55.804 --> 38:59.007

39:09.478 --> 39:11.349

TO MEET MY BROTHER.

39:14.683 --> 39:15.984

I DIDN'T SCARE HIM OFF.
