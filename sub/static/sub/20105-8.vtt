that featured your girlfriend.

blubbering like a little bitch.

Was that just
part of the show?

Duh.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.858
It was just a prank.
He didn't really do her.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.735
Stasha was in on it.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.567
For, like, 30 seconds,
I thought it was real.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.072
Quite an actor,
your girlfriend.

for falling for it.

Not really a coffee person.

- Go to town.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.926
Mmm. That's good stuff.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.013
One last thing, Rudy.

22:34.228 --> 22:37.721
We were hoping you could shed some light
on an incident Kong Hoshi had with Finn.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.932
If you say the letters "N",
"D" or "A",

22:40.150 --> 22:41.641
I am so gonna
bag-tag your ass.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.227
I didn't sign any NDA.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.152
I wasn't there,
but I heard about it.

22:45.364 --> 22:49.199
Kong's son, Lee, tried to skateboard
off his rooftop into the pool and missed.

22:49.952 --> 22:50.988
Wound up crippled for life.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.739
Does that have anything
to do with Finn?

22:53.873 --> 22:54.863
Finn was Lee's hero.

22:55.082 --> 22:58.951
And Finn might have provided Lee with some
pro tips for how to pull off said stunt.

22:59.169 --> 23:03.083
Rumor is, the show had to cough up
beaucoup settlement money to Kong's family.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.206
We need to have
another chat with Kong.

23:05.801 --> 23:06.917

He was gay, I was a nympho.

So, how about we hop
on the same brain train?

you're gonna find interesting.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.839
Let's focus
on the future, huh?

33:31.051 --> 33:32.087

33:33.053 --> 33:34.510
Unlimited growth.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.178
Unlimited wealth.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.096
Let's step into my office.

33:38.308 --> 33:40.265
Nah, you step into my tub.

33:44.898 --> 33:45.604
Come on

33:46.608 --> 33:48.099
Come on.

33:48.318 --> 33:49.274
I got work to do.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.981
(CROW CAWING)

34:04.209 --> 34:06.496
The old McDonough
family estate.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.666
So many childhood memories.

34:15.804 --> 34:19.922
After you would beat me,
or humiliate me,

34:20.100 --> 34:23.559
or psychologically torture
Mom, I'd visit this well.

34:23.770 --> 34:26.228
I'd toss a penny inside
and wish you'd drop dead.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.445
Oh, poor you!

34:36.866 --> 34:39.904
You were miserable
because I beat you.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.572
I beat you because
you were miserable.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.078
I offered you a shot

34:47.335 --> 34:49.496
at making millions
of dollars...

34:49.713 --> 34:51.454
Hundreds of millions...

34:51.672 --> 34:53.880
Together, father and son,

34:55.677 --> 34:57.919
but poor baby
has hurt feelings.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.132
You're weak.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.683
You're no businessman.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.346
You were a waste
of my sperm.

35:11.401 --> 35:12.733
I gotta say...

35:14.279 --> 35:15.315
That kind of stings.

There's about $1.40
in pennies down there, Dad.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.063
Maybe you can bribe
your way out.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.174
- Surprise.
- Not really.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.722
What with the two dead
zombies out there,

36:24.933 --> 36:26.970
I'd be a lot more surprised if
your pops was sitting in that chair.

He's alive and... well.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.354
Like I care.

36:39.698 --> 36:40.438
So...

36:42.659 --> 36:44.992
How you wanna do this?
Cowboy style?

36:45.995 --> 36:48.487
Reach for your pistols. See
who's the Quick Draw McGraw?

36:48.707 --> 36:50.039
Shoot you, Don E.?

36:51.126 --> 36:52.287
I need you.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.703
Hell, I got two brick
and mortar businesses to run.

36:55.672 --> 36:56.662
You read this?

36:58.675 --> 36:59.711
Above my pay grade.

36:59.926 --> 37:00.962
My dad saw the future...

37:01.177 --> 37:02.213
Ah, the future is brains.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.301
He told me that much.

37:03.513 --> 37:05.926
Did he share with you how much
money he thought we could make

37:06.141 --> 37:07.348
if we only aimed bigger?

37:09.436 --> 37:10.222
Much bigger?

37:10.603 --> 37:12.094
I say you should
manage the bar here.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.396
This is your place.
What you say goes.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.439
- I'll handle the brain business...
