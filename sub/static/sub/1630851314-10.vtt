00:02.002 --> 00:03.795
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.837 --> 00:05.630
MICHAEL:
Alex and I fixed it.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.215
We got the Lockhart machine to
work properly so we can retrieve

00:07.257 --> 00:08.717
the rest of Theo's equation.
That would totally give us

00:08.758 --> 00:10.218
the advantage.
Whoever gets the science

00:10.260 --> 00:12.220
first controls
whose body Max stays in.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.764
I found the alien the Lockhart
machine's trying to contact.

00:14.806 --> 00:15.974
His name is Dallas.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.018
LIZ:
You found the alien.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.894
We found his best friend who's
been trying to save his life.

00:19.936 --> 00:22.063
You said on the phone, this was
a matter of life and death, Max.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.606
Around here,
they call me "Jones."

00:27.944 --> 00:30.030
(door creaks)

00:36.494 --> 00:39.748
(door creaks)

00:39.789 --> 00:42.417
I shouldn't
be here, Buck.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.461
It's almost time.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.712
You're gonna be fine.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.755
How?

00:46.796 --> 00:48.256
Every time it happens,

00:48.298 --> 00:49.799
it's like my head's
gonna explode,

00:49.841 --> 00:51.801
and all I see is
that weird machine.

00:51.843 --> 00:54.554
What if I lose control,
chaos ensues?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.181
Mesa Pines Gazette
leads with

00:56.222 --> 00:58.600
"Cursed Orphan Weirdo
Kills His Only Friend"?

00:58.641 --> 01:01.019
Hey, Captain Spiral,
you know the part

01:01.061 --> 01:02.937
in Goblet of Fire when Harry
puts the mermaid egg underwater,

01:02.979 --> 01:04.397
and it stops screaming?

01:05.482 --> 01:08.610
Johnny Doe,
you're the mermaid egg.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.405
So you're gonna drown me?!

01:12.447 --> 01:13.823
Don't be a Hufflepuff.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.326
Everyone knows
sound's muted by water.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.663
Why are you doing this?

01:22.248 --> 01:24.834
'Cause this goes
beyond bunkmates.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.836
You know why.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.339

(laughing):
The-the weirdest part

02:21.724 --> 02:24.477
is thinking that Jones probably
slept in my bed

02:24.519 --> 02:26.479
and ate my Comet Crunch.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.149
I'm all filled up
on breakfast puns this morning.

02:29.190 --> 02:32.527
Is Heath taking any
of your calls?

02:32.569 --> 02:36.865
No. And every text he ignores
about stealing my tapes

02:36.906 --> 02:39.117
and spores only ups me wanting
to strangle him.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.493
Do we really need
all that stuff?

02:40.535 --> 02:42.370
Every attempt
at separating your cells

02:42.412 --> 02:45.123
from Jones' feels
like Groundhog Day.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.625
The membranes just
fuse back together.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.669
When rebuilding your
heart, I was experimenting

02:49.711 --> 02:51.129
with binding proteins,

02:51.171 --> 02:53.173
but without my tapes,
I'm not even close

02:53.214 --> 02:54.883
to square one, and...
We're gonna find him.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.885
Okay?

02:56.926 --> 02:59.053
You're right. I'm going
to sever your tether from Jones

02:59.095 --> 03:00.597
and get you back
in your tattooed body--

03:00.638 --> 03:01.890
longhorn and all--

03:01.931 --> 03:04.017

lot to think about.

of there being...

03:25.038 --> 03:27.290
(laughing):
Well, just...

03:27.332 --> 03:30.001
it is rare

To what do I owe

03:48.436 --> 03:53.024
this spread of cometquiles
and flying sauce-cakes?

03:53.066 --> 03:57.320
I am just making sure you
are back in fighting shape.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.780
How is that noggin holding up

03:58.821 --> 04:00.031
after your run-in
with the Lockhart machine?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.908
Much better, thank you.
Good.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.034
Especially now
that you're here.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.286
Mm.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.664
Hey, at ease, soldier.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.541
I've been hammering
out a theory

04:10.583 --> 04:12.877
on why the Lockhart machine
turns on every 47 days.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.170
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.297
Tell me.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.343
You said your predecessor
was studying weather patterns.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.928
Lightning patterns,
specifically.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.846
Okay. So,
at any given moment,

04:23.888 --> 04:27.100
thousands of lightning storms
create an electromagnetic wave.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.726
As these waves
combine and grow,

04:28.768 --> 04:31.020
they create a repeating
atmospheric heartbeat.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.607
This heartbeat is the Earth's
fundamental resonant frequency.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.943
And so I'm guessing
that the machine was set

04:36.985 --> 04:39.570
to pulse a message
on this heartbeat,

04:39.612 --> 04:41.656
but my father's
ill-conceived addition

04:41.698 --> 04:43.866
caused it to trigger
on a 47-day cycle?

04:43.908 --> 04:46.661
Exactly. I just can't wait
another month, though,

04:46.703 --> 04:48.705
for whatever message my mom
has locked in the machine.

04:48.746 --> 04:52.041
The science to end the fight
is trapped in the glass.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.252
Okay, but even if this works,
don't we need the alien

04:54.294 --> 04:55.586
that it's calling out to?

04:59.048 --> 05:01.050
Isobel and Maria found him.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.803
He, uh, lives out in Lincoln,

05:03.845 --> 05:06.014
goes by "Dallas."

05:06.055 --> 05:08.016
If I didn't know better,

05:08.057 --> 05:10.184
I-I would say
I was looking at your file.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.061
The way he bounced from
one foster home to another.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.438
Have you... have you read this?

05:13.479 --> 05:14.397
I'll see the movie
when it comes out.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.857
All that matters

05:15.898 --> 05:18.067
is that we get Dallas
in front of that machine.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.028
Do you think you can get
the wannabe-TARDIS

05:20.069 --> 05:21.571
out of Deep Sky for a spin?

05:25.992 --> 05:27.952
(gasps)

05:27.994 --> 05:31.831
Okay, um, how does
a journalist

05:31.873 --> 05:34.917
from Chicago win three
state medals in archery?

05:34.959 --> 05:38.087
My parents encouraged me
to follow my heart.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.049
You should, too.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.802
Uh... (laughs)

05:44.844 --> 05:48.181
(sighs)

05:48.222 --> 05:50.558
It's empowering

05:50.600 --> 05:52.185
to nock the arrow...

05:53.394 --> 05:55.104
...draw the bow...

05:55.146 --> 05:56.481
(sighs)

05:56.522 --> 05:58.775
...and watch it silently
cut across the sky.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.487
Ah.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.908
See?
(laughing):
Oh, my.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.202
You can do anything

06:09.243 --> 06:11.329
you put your mind to.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.960

06:19.879 --> 06:22.715
My job interview
at the Dalien beckons.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.551
Are you thinking
about sticking around Roswell?

06:25.593 --> 06:28.304
I'm exploring options.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.465
Looks like
your practice is growing.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.509
Does he know
about his otherworldly pedigree?

07:06.551 --> 07:08.594
From what I can
tell, no, but, uh,

07:08.636 --> 07:11.472
Michael and I are excited to
welcome him into the pod squad.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.516
Yeah, you seem oddly chipper
about this.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.435
Yeah, I am.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.855
I'm thinking that maybe my
calling is helping other people.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.482
I've been... I've been coaching
Rosa with her power, right?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.276
And she has been killing it.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.403
So maybe I can help this guy
accept his new identity.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.405
Yeah, well, according
to these scans,

07:27.447 --> 07:28.990
you're also gonna have
to tell him that he suffers

07:29.031 --> 07:31.576
from acute traumatic deficits
in his temporal lobe.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.287
Well, I'll just get him
to open up

07:34.328 --> 07:35.955
after one of his sermons,
I guess.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.081
He's a preacher?

07:37.123 --> 07:38.499
Yeah.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.792
Oh, but he's, like,
a cool preacher.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.419
He thinks
his boss is in the sky,

07:41.461 --> 07:42.837
and you want to tell him
he fell from it?

07:42.879 --> 07:45.256
It'll shatter
his worldview.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.884
Let me gather my files,
and we'll do it together.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.051
I mean, maybe if we show him

07:49.093 --> 07:50.386
that you have
the same physiology,

07:50.428 --> 07:52.180
he'll be more inclined
to trust you

07:52.221 --> 07:55.016
before you pull the existential
rug out from under him.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.102
Right.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.939
But look, as I've filled in
for Father Linus lately,

08:01.981 --> 08:03.983
I've gotten
to know a lot of you.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.819
You shared your
prayers with me.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.113
They were prayers for unity.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.865
Because, you see,

08:10.907 --> 08:14.744
Roswell is a town divided
by hatred.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.787
But you see,
that... that hatred,

08:16.829 --> 08:20.374
that uncertainty--
it does not have to define us.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.629
I want you all
to do me a favor.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.506
I want you to turn to a neighbor

08:26.547 --> 08:28.633
because you just might
be surprised

08:28.674 --> 08:31.344
how much the two of
you have in common.

08:31.385 --> 08:34.847
Hey, neighbor. I don't think
I can take much more of this.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.766
You know what, Michael?

08:36.807 --> 08:38.851
I think this might actually be
a really good exercise for you.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.645
Hmm.
Hey, neighbor.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.190
A scientist and two aliens

with our brother?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.904
Okay, not the time
or place, Isobel.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.949
Max and I hit a roadblock
looking for Heath.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.659
I'm hoping his
best friend/patient

08:54.700 --> 08:55.910
will be able to
help me find him.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.621
Ah, get in line,
Speedy Ortecho.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.457
We need our long-lost relative
to retrieve Theo's "schmience"

09:01.499 --> 09:03.292
from inside the mystical jukebox
my mom built.

09:03.334 --> 09:06.712
Thinking a little mindscape
nudge to invite him over.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.215
Open up over some acetone
margaritas might do the trick.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.883
Ooh, do you mind poking around
for Heath's whereabouts?

09:10.925 --> 09:14.136
Oh. Ye of little faith.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.138
And how about you, sir?

09:17.848 --> 09:18.933
(whooshing)
Yeah.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.279
I'm gonna tell you what I see,
and I'm gonna give you

09:31.320 --> 09:33.114
an opportunity
to tell me I'm wrong.

09:33.155 --> 09:36.993
Two burglars at the
desert outside your house

09:37.034 --> 09:39.662
were identified as
high-priced mercenaries.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.706
Both men were found
slaughtered a day later

09:41.747 --> 09:44.875
by a confounding murder
weapon. Burned them

09:44.917 --> 09:46.294
from the inside out.
(grunting)

09:46.335 --> 09:48.546
I linked similar scorch marks

09:48.588 --> 09:50.590
in their getaway car.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.842
A few days later,
two tourists go missing.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.595
And a similar scorch pattern
is found in their car.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.013
And Pete's body is found

09:57.054 --> 09:58.139
with injuries

09:58.180 --> 09:59.473
consistent with those sustained

09:59.515 --> 10:00.975
in both crimes.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.269
Look, forgive me, ma'am,

10:03.311 --> 10:05.646
but what you're describing
is a lightsaber.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.691
And besides that,
most crimes are personal.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.985
I mean, these three entities
don't seem to know each another,

10:11.027 --> 10:12.612
and I mean, I barely knew Pete.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.322
Oh, you and Pete didn't like
one another,

10:14.363 --> 10:16.407
but he filled me in
a lot about you.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.327
You were a suspect in the
murder of your brother-in-law.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.329
And there were some
inconsistencies

10:21.370 --> 10:24.498
of electrical outages stemming
from your house two years ago.

10:24.540 --> 10:27.460
Fractal burn patterns
all around town.

10:27.501 --> 10:28.878
I went back to
Zeke Murphy's car,

10:28.919 --> 10:30.671
and I found one of them
on the hood.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.382
Oddity surrounds
you, Evans.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.969
So the oddity of this case
seems right up your alley.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.513
The fact that whoever did this

10:39.555 --> 10:41.182
makes you look at me
with questions--

10:41.223 --> 10:42.516
frankly, that pisses me off.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.769
I promise you,

10:44.810 --> 10:47.772
no one is more committed
to Roswell than I am.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.233
God, you know, I want
to be wrong here, Evans.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.069
I really do,
but as you know

10:53.110 --> 10:55.738
from my track record,
I rarely am.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.699
Which leaves us
with only one option.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.452
You need to turn in your badge
till we straighten this out.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.539
Iz? Hey! Hey, you all right?

11:05.581 --> 11:07.083
Oh.

11:07.124 --> 11:09.251
(groans)
DALLAS:
Thank God you're awake.

11:09.293 --> 11:11.504
Uh, just don't move.
The ambulance just showed up.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.089
You called 911?

11:13.130 --> 11:14.882
Yeah. When someone passes out,

11:14.924 --> 11:16.384
I rely on the good book
of Henry Gray.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.968
Oh, my gosh,
honestly, I am fine.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.221
This happens to me all the time.
I'm just...

11:20.262 --> 11:22.723
Very thirsty.
Are you sure?

11:22.765 --> 11:24.558
Mm-hmm. Totally fine.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.894
Okay, I'll... I'll call off
the cavalry then.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.481
What's the deal
with the mind shove?
I don't know.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.858
Do you think he's on to us?
No. It felt involuntary.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.694
I mean, that's what I get
for violating consent.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.445
Alex has the machine,
but only for a few hours.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.614
How do we get Baby Yoda
where we need him to be?

11:38.656 --> 11:40.616
Okay, y-you guys do this.
I got to go charm an address

11:40.658 --> 11:42.284
out of the preacher man.
Excuse me.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.661
Um, hi. Before
I lose you,

11:43.703 --> 11:45.287
I, uh, was

11:45.329 --> 11:46.789
wondering if you could
help me find someone.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.499
Heath Tuchman?
Oh, yeah.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.792
I'm Liz Ortecho.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.503
Oh. You're the lab partner
from L.A.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.880
Uh, do you have any idea
where he's at?

11:54.922 --> 11:56.549
We're working on a
project together,

11:56.590 --> 11:58.342
but his cell reception
is horrible.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.387
He's probably up in his, uh,
family's cabin up in Santa Rosa.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.847
He kind of holes up there
sometimes

12:02.888 --> 12:04.140
when he goes deep science.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.225
Uh, I can drop you a pin?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.352
Yeah, please.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.146
And sent.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.273
(phone chimes)
Got it.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.108
Thanks.
Yup.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.985
I thought he was getting
rid of the EMTs.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.279
Okay, change of plan.
You lure Dallas.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.613
I'll deal with this.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.990
We said
we would do this together.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.451
Okay, fine.
You mindscape the EMTs.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.995
I'll lure Dallas to the junkyard
that I don't own.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.247
Sorry. Look, they insisted

12:28.289 --> 12:30.040
that they check you out
at the hospital.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.376
Look, I can follow behind
in my car and...

12:32.418 --> 12:34.462
give you a ride back
afterwards, though.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.505
MICHAEL:
Don't you dare leave me alone
with that preacher.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.965
ISOBEL:
Calling an audible.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.050
MICHAEL:
Care to fill me in on it?

12:40.092 --> 12:42.219
ISOBEL: No time.
(high-pitched ringing)

12:42.261 --> 12:43.763
(hissing)

12:43.804 --> 12:45.389
Oh, my gosh.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.349
I hate when
that happens.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.101
The good news is, my friend here

12:49.143 --> 12:51.687
is a great mechanic, and
he has an hour free. I'm sure

12:51.729 --> 12:53.355
he can help you.

12:55.983 --> 13:00.237
I, uh, patched up
the radiator,

13:00.279 --> 13:02.156
replaced the engine fan,

13:02.198 --> 13:03.657
and I topped off
your coolant.
All right.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.493
Yup.
Good to go then.

13:05.534 --> 13:11.540
No. Your, um, catalytic
converter-- it's corroded.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.126
That's why it overheated.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.338
Would you, uh,
mind if I lend a hand?

13:17.379 --> 13:19.673
I dig seeing people
in their element.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.467
Helps me get
to know my parishioners,

13:21.509 --> 13:22.843
especially the new ones.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.220
I'm not a new parishioner.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.596
I only tagged along

13:25.638 --> 13:27.431
because Isobel insisted.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.309
Well, something must have still
inspired you to tag along?

13:30.351 --> 13:31.936
Look, I-I get it, man.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.688
You're not the first to be
intimidated by this collar.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.982
Would it help if I told you
about my three favorite B's?

13:37.024 --> 13:39.610
Bourbon, billiards,
and Bob Marley.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.570
I really need some
room for my tools.

13:41.612 --> 13:45.157
To fix the catalytic converter?
Yeah.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.160
Which is nowhere
near the engine.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.832
Yeah, my car's fine,
isn't it?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.793
Which begs the question.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.711
If I make you so uncomfortable,
you don't want to be left alone

13:57.753 --> 14:00.005
with me, why stall?
(vehicle approaching)

14:00.047 --> 14:01.632
(vehicle door opens)

14:03.342 --> 14:05.511
Excuse me. Customer.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.723
You positive this guy
doesn't know he's an alien?

14:09.765 --> 14:11.141
'Cause I'm pretty sure

14:11.183 --> 14:12.476
he heard the brain tweet

14:12.518 --> 14:13.185
that I sent you back
at the church.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.521
Good luck.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.443
(door creaks)

14:23.821 --> 14:26.824
We really need to stop breaking
into Heath Tuchman's properties.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.660
(door creaks closed)

14:36.834 --> 14:40.004
Well, we're definitely
in the right place.

14:40.045 --> 14:44.008
If his work is
here, where is he?

14:51.098 --> 14:52.933
You.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.353
(high-pitched ringing)

15:00.941 --> 15:03.027
What's up, Doc?

15:08.949 --> 15:10.993
Perimeter's clear.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.953
No sign of Heath,
but I did find this.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.622
Jacket I bought you?

15:14.663 --> 15:16.206
Jones was here?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.461
Looks like your handwriting,

15:20.502 --> 15:22.379
meaning they're working
together.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.964
That makes sense he would
go after your lab partner

15:24.006 --> 15:25.925
and try to make a deal.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.259
Heath's the next best thing
to you,

15:27.301 --> 15:28.177
especially
with all your research.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.972
This.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.974
This is a letter I wrote

15:34.016 --> 15:35.434
describing where
I buried the tapes.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.478
I gave it to Kyle.
It was in his office.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.522
Why would Heath have been
in Kyle's office?
I don't know.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.900
When he was looking
for Dr. Holden? I don't know.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.568
(electrical buzzing)

15:44.610 --> 15:46.278
Hey.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.615
What's wrong?

15:51.825 --> 15:54.411
I got comfortable thinking
Jones was just gonna lay low.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.705
He's been playing us ever since
I opened the cavern door.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.040
I should have seen this coming.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.084
No. No one saw
your genetic replica

16:00.125 --> 16:03.045
and my ex-partner working
together on the bingo card.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.130
Okay? So let's just

16:05.172 --> 16:08.801
see how far this unholy alliance
has gone, and let's catch up.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.763
(sighs)
Okay.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.682
Okay, um...

16:16.392 --> 16:18.686
I recognize some
of these formulas from my tapes.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.437
Heath's still working
under the assumption

16:20.479 --> 16:22.690
that CRISPR will splice
through binding proteins.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.984
But he needs all the stuff
you did to Maria, though, right?

16:25.025 --> 16:27.319
Sound frequency manipulation.
He's not there yet.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.904
But it does look like

16:28.946 --> 16:31.240
they're making some headway
on the equation.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.784
I mean, Heath's not
a criminal mastermind,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.953
but he's a savvy geneticist.
It's not gonna take him long

16:35.995 --> 16:37.830
to figure out
the remaining components.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.918
I bet with your tapes back,
we can beat him to the punch.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.716
Oh, it's okay.
Liz won't mind

16:48.757 --> 16:50.134
if I borrow some
of her CRISPR chemicals.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.802
Where's her research bag?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.637
Liz broke my bond
with Maria DeLuca,

16:53.679 --> 16:55.723
and I know
Little Miss Mad Scientist loves

16:55.764 --> 16:57.599
to keep excessive notes.

16:57.641 --> 17:02.271
Listen, I know your friend's
life is on the line right now.

17:02.312 --> 17:05.357
So, I'm assuming you're Cagney
to Space Lacey over here,

17:05.399 --> 17:08.027
but this galaxy turd is
using you to do his bidding.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.738
He is never going
to heal Dallas.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.032
I have experience

17:13.073 --> 17:15.117
in Dallas's unique physiology,
so please

17:15.159 --> 17:17.327
just let me...
(high-pitched ringing)

17:18.120 --> 17:20.581
There's Ortecho's bag.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.210
Heath wouldn't waste his time
treating a problem

17:25.252 --> 17:27.337
when he's already seen proof
of a cure.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.257
Isn't that right?

17:33.635 --> 17:35.763
(high-pitched ringing)

17:35.804 --> 17:37.222
(choking)

17:37.264 --> 17:39.308
I always hated you Valentis.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.143
(panting)

17:41.185 --> 17:43.187
(intercom beeps)
NURSE:
Heads up, Dr. V.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.897
Sheriff Taylor's en route
and pissed.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.232
(groaning)

17:47.274 --> 17:48.692
HEATH:
Hey, hey!

17:48.734 --> 17:50.986
Just let him go, all right?
I know where

17:51.028 --> 17:52.237
we can get our hands
on the rest of the chemicals

17:52.279 --> 17:54.782
we need.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.950
(choking)

17:56.992 --> 17:58.077
(groans)

17:58.118 --> 18:00.496
(coughs, pants)

18:02.414 --> 18:04.333
DALLAS:
I... I know people
see the collar

18:04.374 --> 18:06.460
and think "nice guy,"
and I am,

18:06.502 --> 18:10.672
but unlike fishes and loaves,
my patience does have an end.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.674
Yeah, I think I
should probably go.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.095
Someone's coming
I want you to talk to.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.679
Could you just give me
a couple more minutes?

18:17.721 --> 18:19.723
Does this friend have
an explanation

18:19.765 --> 18:23.060
that satisfies why you were
in my office the other day,

18:23.102 --> 18:26.647
or asking about J.D.
and-and Camp Mesa Pines,

18:26.688 --> 18:29.691
or why you have me standing
in a junkyard right now?

18:31.026 --> 18:33.112
That's what I thought.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.450
ISOBEL:
I know you can hear my thoughts.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.661
Please don't go.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.042
(phone chimes)

18:47.084 --> 18:49.044
Just got an email
from Kyle.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.754
Jones and Heath were just
in his office.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.507
They... took my bag.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.637
(scoffs)
All of my theories for using
resonant sound frequency

18:58.679 --> 19:00.681
to sever the connection
are in there.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.183
If-if Heath solves
this equation before Michael

19:03.225 --> 19:04.977
is able to get it
out of the machine,

19:05.018 --> 19:07.312
then Jones'll be able to stay
in your body permanently.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.856
Okay, hey.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.440
We'll figure this out, okay?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.609
Hey, none of this is your fault.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.112
You've dedicated your life
to saving Maria and me.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.197
Heath is a desperate man who's
making all the wrong moves

19:17.239 --> 19:18.949
in the name of
saving his friend.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.742
You got to let
yourself off the hook.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.744
These are Heath's
missteps, not yours.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.204
Maybe I could use that
to reason with him.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.374
Heath still thinks
CRISPR is the answer.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.126
There is only one place
that he would go.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.962
Hey.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.716
Ever had one of those days
where you, uh,

19:35.757 --> 19:38.302
just can't find what
you're looking for? (laughs)

19:38.343 --> 19:40.470
Yup. That's why I'm here.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.515
I'm looking for your statement
from the night of the break-in.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.021
I wish I could help, but
there's someplace I got to be.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.440
You've been out of town
for quite some time.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.317
Must have been
in a rush, leaving

19:53.358 --> 19:55.235
your car and phone
at the crime scene.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.238
Am I suspect, Sheriff?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.365
Should you be?

20:00.407 --> 20:02.743
You disappeared
from a crime scene

20:02.784 --> 20:04.745
that's connected
to four homicides

20:04.786 --> 20:07.039
and two missing persons.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.249
I think it's time
you tell me where you've been.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.919
Uh, I was with my uncle.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.129
Here. I can give
you his number.

20:15.756 --> 20:19.176
Was, uh, Isobel
at this family reunion?

20:19.218 --> 20:22.304
Of course not. Why?

20:22.346 --> 20:25.057
Well, she also happened
to be away two days ago.

20:25.098 --> 20:28.727
And she was seen with Deputy
Pete on the day he was killed.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.896
That means nothing.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.564
So, um...

20:32.606 --> 20:35.651
And yet, the day before he died,

20:35.692 --> 20:37.694
he was obsessed
with doing right by her.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.238
She had nothing to do with this.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.906
You're getting mighty defensive.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.367
And I've seen plenty
of guilty men in my life,

20:43.408 --> 20:45.327
and you sure look like...

20:45.369 --> 20:47.287
Is that a file
on Isobel and Max?

20:47.329 --> 20:48.956
It's nothing you can see
without a warrant.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.457
Which is why I came prepared.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.711
What in the...?

20:57.714 --> 20:59.132
Uh-uh.
(groans)

21:00.592 --> 21:01.760
(handcuffs clicking)

21:01.802 --> 21:03.637
Uh, okay,

21:03.679 --> 21:05.931
I-I still don't
understand how...

21:05.973 --> 21:08.308
how you knew that
I would hear you.

21:08.350 --> 21:12.312
Okay, look, clearly,

21:12.354 --> 21:15.565
there's something special
about you.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.442
Have you ever wondered

21:17.484 --> 21:20.153
what that might be?

21:20.195 --> 21:24.157
I mean, my entire life,
I've heard the voices of people

21:24.199 --> 21:29.037
within earshot, you know, even
when their mouths were closed.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.789
And you know,
when I was young,

21:30.831 --> 21:33.000
I'd tell adults, and
they'd say I was crazy,

21:33.041 --> 21:35.043
until I joined this youth group,

21:35.085 --> 21:37.421
and I realized

21:37.462 --> 21:40.340
I was actually
hearing people's prayers.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.845
But you don't believe me.

21:44.886 --> 21:48.890
No, no. Uh, no, no, no,
I do, because

21:48.932 --> 21:53.103
Michael and I...

21:53.145 --> 21:55.564
we experienced the same thing.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.359
Which is how
our kind communicate

21:59.401 --> 22:01.111
with each other.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.280
You see, Dallas...

22:05.782 --> 22:07.909
...we're aliens.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.164
I know about the night

22:12.205 --> 22:14.207
you were found wandering
in Lake Mesa Pines.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.792
That's the same night

22:15.834 --> 22:19.171
that Michael and I were
discovered just like you.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.173
Seven years old,

22:21.214 --> 22:25.177
alone, naked and mute.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.346
Okay.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.514
Let me show you something.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.601
(high-pitched ringing)

22:37.689 --> 22:38.857
Ta-da!

22:38.899 --> 22:40.859
See?

22:40.901 --> 22:42.861
It's cool. Wait.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.197
Dallas?
(mutters, gasps)

22:45.238 --> 22:47.366
(high-pitched ringing)

22:47.407 --> 22:48.533
(groans)

22:48.575 --> 22:50.494
This is going south
fast, Guerin.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.330
Yeah, you're right.
Chitchat time's over.

22:54.122 --> 22:55.332
No. Guerin, wait.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.627
(machine chirps, whirs)

23:01.338 --> 23:03.548
(yelling)

23:04.466 --> 23:06.343
You've seen this before.

23:06.385 --> 23:10.222
Every 47 days for the
last 25 years of my life.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.725
Keep that thing away from me!

23:14.434 --> 23:16.103
Whoa. Oh, my God.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.396
(groans)

23:17.437 --> 23:19.022
Wait.
Leave me the hell alone.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.023
All of you.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.650
ISOBEL:
Wait.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.693
(engine starts, revs)

23:30.409 --> 23:32.077
I'm turning it on.
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.787
No. Dallas just stormed
out of here, Alex.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.747
The only play now is
to rip off the Band-Aid

23:35.789 --> 23:38.208
and hope whatever he sees drives
him off the road somewhere

23:38.250 --> 23:40.043
so I can find him, and
I'm gonna question him.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.628
Did you see
the look on his face?

23:41.670 --> 23:44.423
He lost his mind.
The only way

23:44.464 --> 23:45.841
you're getting his help now is

23:45.882 --> 23:47.342
by talking him
off the ledge first.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.302
Talking failed.

23:49.344 --> 23:51.304
I-I don't get it.
You have been searching

23:51.346 --> 23:53.098
for somebody like you
your entire life.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.892
And you've found somebody, and
you don't want to talk to them?

23:55.934 --> 23:57.602
What am I supposed to say
exactly?

23:57.644 --> 23:59.521
What you need to do is you need
to think about how you felt

23:59.563 --> 24:00.897
when you first learned
who you are.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.191
Oh, I have.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.611
And that is exactly why
I don't want to talk to him.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.406
Because I read
his file.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.242
I read his file three times.

24:14.327 --> 24:16.663
I can't relive that again.

24:19.499 --> 24:23.336
(sighs)
You need to stop
being afraid of your past.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.549
'Cause the only way
you're gonna get

24:27.591 --> 24:29.926
what you want out of this
is to show Dallas

24:29.968 --> 24:33.138
how similar his journey is
to yours.

24:36.308 --> 24:40.103
LIZ:
Bandelier University keeps
CRISPR in their biolab.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.980
Guard said they waved
me through security

24:42.022 --> 24:44.024
about 20 minutes ago, so it
means we're in the right place.

24:44.065 --> 24:45.609
Comforting. Biogenetics lab
is down this way.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.152
Oh, my God.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.031
Has she been stabbed?

24:51.072 --> 24:54.534
(sighs)
Hey, fight. Come on. Please.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.287
Hello? Come on.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.754
Damn it!

25:05.795 --> 25:08.798
Thanks.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.218
I was counting
on you today, Kyle.

25:11.259 --> 25:13.803
I mean, of all days
to pick a fight with Taylor.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.889
Yeah, I made a mistake.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.641
I lost my cool.

25:17.682 --> 25:22.771
What button could she possibly
have pushed to do that?

25:24.231 --> 25:26.358
Whatever. It doesn't matter now.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.944
All that matters is
getting those files.

25:28.985 --> 25:31.780
I was kind of forced
to burn the files

25:31.821 --> 25:33.365
before Taylor could snatch them.

25:33.406 --> 25:35.825
Well...

25:35.867 --> 25:39.454
how do you plan on convincing
Dallas to trust you now?

25:39.496 --> 25:41.122
Wait. Me?
Yeah.

25:41.164 --> 25:43.416
What happened to us?

25:43.458 --> 25:45.043
Uh, well,
when you didn't show,

25:45.085 --> 25:47.003
I sort of had to go off-book,
and I kind of...

25:47.963 --> 25:49.798
I froze him!

25:49.839 --> 25:52.425
You have ice powers now?

25:53.677 --> 25:57.097
In place, you mean.
Not much better, by the way.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.848
Well, I don't know
what I was thinking.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.600
I kind of panicked.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.938
I think your mistake
was waiting for me.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.607
No, it wasn't, because,
you know, we'd agreed.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.068
You're... you're the doctor,
you know?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.903
You're-you're
the physiology expert.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.280
And he's a man of faith.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.199
I bet you'd have done
a much better job

26:16.241 --> 26:17.742
at convincing
him than me,

26:17.784 --> 26:21.162
if I hadn't made you...
doubt yourself.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.291
I didn't want you to fail.

26:24.332 --> 26:26.459
And because of that,
we both did.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.755
All right, well...

26:30.797 --> 26:32.507
what do we do now?

26:34.467 --> 26:37.220
I think it's time you start
listening to your instincts.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.474
It's not your fault, Max.

26:41.516 --> 26:44.894
You said clones are identical.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.730
Biologically,

26:46.771 --> 26:48.690
but temperament is determined
by how you're raised.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.692
I was raised
to be a tool of war.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.777
Built by Nora and Louise.
And-and then Jones...

26:52.819 --> 26:55.447
Ann and David raised you.

26:55.488 --> 26:56.740
Forget about Nora and Louise.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.158
Forget about Jones.

26:58.199 --> 26:59.868
I can't, Liz.

26:59.909 --> 27:02.871
I mean, that's-that's
the problem. I-I...

27:02.912 --> 27:05.749
I ran to him when I was
a kid. I chose him.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.125
And no matter
how many awful things

27:07.167 --> 27:08.251
Jones does,
I'm still drawn to him.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.878
Max, it's a tether, that's all.

27:09.919 --> 27:11.421
What if that is my destiny?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.547
Then screw destiny.

27:14.049 --> 27:17.218
'Cause you, Max Evans--
you are the most...

27:17.260 --> 27:21.264
genuine, caring, wonderful
person I have ever met.

27:21.306 --> 27:25.185
I-I saw it in your eyes that
first day on the playground,

27:25.226 --> 27:27.729
and I still see it in them,

27:27.771 --> 27:29.648
even now.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.818
You can't be sure.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.988
Yeah, I can, 'cause I'm not
the only one who sees it.

27:37.030 --> 27:41.785
Isobel loves you,
Michael loves you, and...

27:45.246 --> 27:48.249
I love you... Max Evans.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.677
MAN (over radio):
Sheriff Taylor on-site

27:58.718 --> 28:00.220
at Bandelier University.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.222
Units on standby for backup.

28:02.263 --> 28:05.392
Go find Heath.
I'll catch up.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.741
(sighs, mutters)

28:21.783 --> 28:24.744
Okay, so-so... so you stumbled
at Johns Hopkins.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.079
(scoffs)

28:26.121 --> 28:27.831
It's not the end of the road
for you.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.999
Well, tell that
to Little Miss Professor

28:30.041 --> 28:32.085
"You'll Never Amount
to Anything."

28:32.127 --> 28:35.338
Yeah. Look at her.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.257
She's wrong, first off.

28:37.298 --> 28:39.342
And she's just one voice.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.095
Just one voice,
out of 7.5 billion, man.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.348
All right, so, then...

28:45.390 --> 28:48.935
what about the voice
in my head, hmm?

28:48.977 --> 28:51.187
The one that keeps telling me
that the only thing

28:51.229 --> 28:54.649
I will ever actually
be good at...

28:54.691 --> 28:56.484
is failing?

28:56.526 --> 28:58.445
I mean, that's why
I'm self-medicating

28:58.486 --> 28:59.988
with mindless shooters. I...

29:00.029 --> 29:01.865
I just can't stop thinking

29:01.906 --> 29:04.409
that maybe I'm not strong enough
to pull myself out of this.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.120
Okay, look.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.915
Take it from someone who

29:10.957 --> 29:13.835
literally hears voices
in his head.

29:13.877 --> 29:16.087
None of that's true.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.467
All right, Heath,
you're-you're the only reason

29:20.508 --> 29:23.011
I'm sitting here sane today.

29:23.052 --> 29:26.014
You know, and despite
all these doctors

29:26.055 --> 29:27.557
that said there's nothing wrong
with my head,

29:27.599 --> 29:30.852
you convinced one
to take a further look.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.105
No one else could have
done that.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.107
Did you already see him?

29:36.149 --> 29:38.359
Yeah, he said that, um...

29:38.401 --> 29:40.695
How did he put it? (laughs)

29:40.737 --> 29:44.240
I have some
neural inconsistencies

29:44.282 --> 29:46.284
that are...

29:47.702 --> 29:50.955
...incompatible with human life.

29:50.997 --> 29:53.166
He said you should be dead?

29:53.208 --> 29:57.086
You know, the church says
that, um,

29:57.128 --> 30:00.381
everything happens
for a purpose,

30:00.423 --> 30:02.217
you know, e-even if
you don't understand it yet.

30:02.258 --> 30:05.136
Come on. God can't
save you, Dallas.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.846
Yeah, well, no one can, Heath.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.015
That's... (sighs)

30:09.057 --> 30:11.142
That's the point.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.646
You're saving me right now.

30:16.856 --> 30:19.275
There ain't no way
I'm gonna let you die on me.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.790
How'd you find me?

30:33.832 --> 30:36.459
Uh, I...

30:36.501 --> 30:38.503
spent a lot of time
at the place

30:38.545 --> 30:40.672
that made me feel
safe as a kid, too.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.590
Well, I wish you hadn't
wasted your energy

30:42.632 --> 30:45.510
'cause I'm not going back
with you.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.637
I get it.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.849
I was an ass.

30:53.309 --> 30:57.146
My only excuse is that
when I look at you,

30:57.188 --> 30:59.190
I feel like I'm
looking at a mirror.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.525
Black and beautiful?

31:00.567 --> 31:03.486
Something like that.

31:06.990 --> 31:10.368
You know, the first
time my powers emerged,

31:10.410 --> 31:13.413
I was living with
these religious nuts.

31:13.454 --> 31:16.249
The oldest had it
out for me.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.668
One day, I couldn't
take it anymore.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.920
And I got so angry.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.215
I somehow sent him
through a window

31:24.257 --> 31:25.884
with my mind.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.887
How'd they react?

31:28.928 --> 31:31.514
At first they thought I
was possessed by a demon.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.474
But when burning me with
a cross didn't work,

31:33.516 --> 31:35.184
they thought I was the demon.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.562
And you believed them.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.983
I was nine.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.860
I didn't know
what I was.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.654
Except alone.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.865
Like you.

31:50.825 --> 31:52.702
You know, it wasn't until...

31:52.744 --> 31:57.332
after being kicked out of
my third separate foster home,

31:57.373 --> 32:00.793
you know, that it dawned
on me, maybe...

32:00.835 --> 32:03.504
my parents weren't dead.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.673
You know, maybe
they abandoned me,

32:05.715 --> 32:08.468
you know, because I was cursed.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.219
That's when you met Heath?

32:10.261 --> 32:13.556
Yeah, he was the only person
I could really trust.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.808
ISOBEL:
We did a, um,

32:15.850 --> 32:17.936
pretty terrible job
at convincing you

32:17.977 --> 32:20.730
to let us
into your inner circle.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.527
You'll have to forgive us.

32:28.029 --> 32:30.156
We don't really meet
people like us.

32:35.411 --> 32:38.247
What is... us? (laughs)

32:41.542 --> 32:44.629
CRISPR isn't gonna get
you all the way there.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.839
You're too late, Roswell.

32:46.881 --> 32:49.175
My entire life, people have

32:49.217 --> 32:51.427
been telling me I'm not
good enough, and they're wrong.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.304
I'm sorry.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.517
You saved my life,

32:57.558 --> 33:00.228
and I sent you away
'cause I was afraid.

33:00.269 --> 33:04.440
But don't let my mistake
lead you to an even bigger one.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.693
You don't need Jones
to save Dallas.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.277
It's too high
a price to pay.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.904
You'd be selling your soul.

33:09.946 --> 33:12.615
You have no idea what Dallas
and I have been through.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.993
I know how far you'd go
to save him,

33:15.034 --> 33:17.870
'cause I've gone just as far
to save the people that I love.

33:17.912 --> 33:20.623
Heath, you don't want to feel
the way I've been feeling.

33:20.665 --> 33:25.294
'Cause all it's been is guilt
and anger and confusion.

33:26.754 --> 33:30.633
I can help you save your friend.

33:30.675 --> 33:34.637
I've been studying alien
physiology for a long time.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.639
You helped me...

33:36.681 --> 33:38.641
when I was confused
about Genoryx.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.685
Let me help you now.

33:47.942 --> 33:49.277
(sighs)

33:49.318 --> 33:50.695
Jones thinks CRISPR has a part

33:50.737 --> 33:52.321
to play in his endgame.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.740
I can buy you some time.

33:53.781 --> 33:55.074
Liz?
Max.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.325
I'm not leaving without him.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.702
HEATH:
No, no.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.162
If Jones finds you here,
he will kill you.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.371
You have to go now.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.706
Not without you.

34:04.625 --> 34:07.045
All right, forgive me
if I'm skeptical. I...

34:07.086 --> 34:09.130
That thing's haunted me
for 25 years.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.007
Well, we fixed it
a few days ago.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.550
It shouldn't hurt anybody
anymore.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.595
Your neurological disorder
is a product

34:15.636 --> 34:17.847
of the distorted frequency
from the alien glass

34:17.889 --> 34:19.348
inside that machine.

34:19.390 --> 34:21.100
I don't know if
it's reversible,

34:21.142 --> 34:24.103
but you have my word that I will
do my best to figure it out.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.149
Y'all still haven't told me why
this is so important.

34:28.191 --> 34:30.485
My mom risked her life
to build that thing in prison.

34:30.526 --> 34:32.487
She said it holds a message
for someone on the outside.

34:32.528 --> 34:33.780
ISOBEL: We think
that someone is you.

34:33.821 --> 34:35.239
And the message is key

34:35.281 --> 34:36.991
to saving someone
very important to us,

34:37.033 --> 34:39.786
and stopping an enemy that
hunted all three of our parents.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.579
It's as complicated
as it sounds,

34:41.621 --> 34:44.207
but two planets are at stake,
and the soul of a guy

34:44.248 --> 34:46.542
I don't very much like
hangs in the balance.

34:51.714 --> 34:54.842
All right, well, uh,

34:54.884 --> 35:00.348
I guess saving souls is kind of
on my business card, right?

but in the dictator's
wicked hands,

36:33.191 --> 36:35.276
it will also only make his reign
