Niggers love being
another man's judge and jury.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
Niggers procrastinate
until it's time to worry.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Niggers love to be late.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Niggers hate to hurry!

Black Entertainment Television

is the worst thing
I've ever seen in my life.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Usher, Michael Jackson
is not a genre of music!

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
And now I'd like
to talk about  Soul Plane.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I've seen what's
around the corner.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
I've seen what's
over the horizon,

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
and I promise you, you niggers
have nothing to celebrate.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I saw Dr. King,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
but the story doesn't end there.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
King's speech was replayed the entire next day

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
on the cable news channels.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Then something unexpected happened.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
People got angry.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Nobody knows exactly what to attribute

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
