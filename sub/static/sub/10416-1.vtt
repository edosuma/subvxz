00:57.357 --> 00:58.847
Hey, Timmy, get me a hot dog.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.105
Hey, Dave.
I like your Dukes of Hazzard T-shirt.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.648
Well, thanks, Sara.
I like your CHiPs T-shirt.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.082
- Thanks.
- Fun party, huh?

01:27.253 --> 01:29.813
Yeah. Except for Arnie Shankman
being here.

01:29.989 --> 01:33.152
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

01:33.927 --> 01:37.021
I feel bad for him with his sister
losing her mind and all.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.425
Whatever.

01:42.001 --> 01:44.765
You know what we should do?
Play Truth or Dare.

01:45.004 --> 01:47.336
- You want to?
- Sure.

01:47.507 --> 01:50.271
Okay, I'll go first. Truth or dare?

01:50.810 --> 01:51.799
Truth.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.275
Have you ever kissed a girl before?

01:54.447 --> 01:56.039
- Well, I...
- Family doesn't count.

01:57.250 --> 02:00.185
- Maybe I'll take dare.
- Okay.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.351
I dare you to kiss me.

02:03.423 --> 02:04.515
Right here?

02:04.691 --> 02:08.491
Yeah. I want everyone to see
that your first kiss is with me.

02:34.888 --> 02:38.187
Got any mustard for that cocktail frank,
butt-lick?

02:49.903 --> 02:52.428
- David Buznik.
- I just landed in St. Louis.

02:52.605 --> 02:56.132
- I hope you wrote my speech.
- I did, sir. I pulled an all nighter.

02:56.409 --> 02:59.310
I look forward to this, Mr. Head.
Never been to St. Louis.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.242
Thank you for allowing me
to come on this trip...

03:04.551 --> 03:06.542
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that sounds great.

03:06.719 --> 03:09.483
If we finish our work,
I'd love to go to a jazz club.

03:09.656 --> 03:10.645
Terrific.

03:10.823 --> 03:13.917
- He hung up on you again, didn't he?
- Yes. Yes, he did.

03:14.160 --> 03:17.755
He's a jerk. You came up with the idea
for the Husky Cat clothing line.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.729
He didn't say thank you.
He should give you a promotion.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.926
There's a creative executive position
that just opened up, so....

03:24.103 --> 03:27.266
Bring that up on the trip.
You gotta stick up for yourself.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.567
I know. I'll figure something out.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.871
I gotta go. Sorry.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.947
I'm gonna miss you.

03:37.517 --> 03:38.779
That guy's looking at us.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.614
You know I don't like it when people
watch me kiss.

03:41.788 --> 03:42.914
I'm sorry.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.452
Take care.

03:46.526 --> 03:48.653
Okay. Bye.

03:50.463 --> 03:51.452
Dave....

03:53.366 --> 03:55.800
- Have a good flight.
- Okay.

04:04.711 --> 04:05.803
I'm sorry.

04:14.053 --> 04:15.987
I think you're in my seat.

04:16.822 --> 04:20.486
Come on, pal. I'm already settled in
here. Can't you sit somewhere else?

04:21.327 --> 04:23.921
You're supposed to sit in the seat
they assigned you.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.066
Nobody cares. Just sit in the seat
I'm supposed to sit in.

04:29.869 --> 04:32.861
Excuse me. This seat's available.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.433
Okay. Thank you.

04:39.712 --> 04:41.202
You're very welcome.

04:44.550 --> 04:45.812
No air.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.376
That's too bad, huh?

05:00.266 --> 05:02.063
You're on my side of the armrest.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.396
We're not gonna have problems, are we?

05:05.071 --> 05:06.060
No.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.106
I'm wetting my Jockeys here.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.172
You gotta get a load of this, keed.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.181
I mean, you like comedies?

05:52.352 --> 05:56.755
I just haven't been sleeping a lot
lately so I was trying to catch some....

06:03.529 --> 06:05.588
Look at this actress here.

06:06.599 --> 06:10.433
What is your position
on breast implants?

06:12.305 --> 06:13.294
This guy.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.998
I can just watch the movie with you.

06:17.143 --> 06:18.132
Excuse me.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.506
- Could I get a headset?
- Certainly.

06:20.847 --> 06:21.905
Thank you.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.386
Probably make out
with my next boyfriend.

06:33.092 --> 06:34.889
Oh, my God, it was disgusting.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.119
Miss?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.361
I'll be right there, sir.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.258
Where's your headset?

06:42.902 --> 06:45.803
She's busy right now, but it's coming.

06:46.439 --> 06:50.705
For crying out loud. You're missing
important plot points.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.240
Ma'am?

06:55.515 --> 06:57.506
Could you give me a second, sir?

07:08.027 --> 07:09.221
Excuse me.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.756
Could I maybe get that headset,
please?

07:11.931 --> 07:15.526
- Do not raise your voice to me, sir.
- I wasn't raising my voice.

07:15.701 --> 07:16.759
Just calm down.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.801
I am calm. I just want my headset.

07:18.971 --> 07:21.599
Our country is going through
a difficult time now.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.298
If you won't cooperate...

07:23.543 --> 07:26.535
I don't know where a headset
ties into patriotism.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.736
Is there a problem here, sir?

07:29.816 --> 07:30.976
I don't think so.

07:31.150 --> 07:34.119
Can you come to the back with me
so we can have a talk?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.380
A talk about what? There's not a
problem.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.184
- The stewardess just keeps...
- Flight attendant.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.756
The flight attendant keeps
ignoring me when...

07:41.928 --> 07:42.952
Calm down.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.097
I am calm.
What is it with you people?

07:45.665 --> 07:46.893
"You people"?

07:47.266 --> 07:48.665
Now wait a minute.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.429
I don't mean you people.
I mean you people.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.437
I will not tolerate any racist
behavior on the plane.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.768
This is a difficult time
for our country.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.605
I'm not a racist.
I just want to watch the movie.

07:59.779 --> 08:03.374
I'm only going to say this
one more time, sir. Calm down.

08:03.549 --> 08:04.607
I'm calm!

08:12.124 --> 08:13.591
All rise.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.761
- What do you think?
- Not guilty. It's a no-brainer.

08:19.932 --> 08:26.428
Mr. Buznik. In case 723, assault and
battery against a flight attendant...

08:27.206 --> 08:28.332
...I find you guilty.

08:30.276 --> 08:34.006
I'm ordering you to pay a fine
of $3500.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.340
Thank God you're okay.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.347
In addition, to prevent
further acts of rage...

08:38.518 --> 08:43.615
...this court orders you to undergo 20
hours of anger management therapy.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.449
Anger management?

08:58.237 --> 09:00.637
Oh, my goodness. Bobby Knight.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.806
- You're in this group?
- Oh, yeah. This is my first day.

09:03.976 --> 09:07.434
- It's my first day also.
- I hope this class cures me.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.274
Working on the anger problem?

09:09.849 --> 09:12.682
Anger? Isn't this
Sexaholics Anonymous?

09:14.587 --> 09:17.078
No. I think that's down the hall.

09:17.256 --> 09:20.419
Well, the hell with this!
I'm going home!

09:43.883 --> 09:45.111
Dr. Rydell?

09:47.553 --> 09:49.714
You don't remember me, do you?

09:50.189 --> 09:55.388
- I sat next to you on the plane.
- Oh, yeah, the headset guy.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.653
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.059
That was a crazy flight.

10:00.232 --> 10:03.861
They actually sentenced me
to anger management for that.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.196
Really?

10:05.404 --> 10:06.871
Wow.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.564
This is incredible.
You could sign this for me...

10:09.742 --> 10:12.734
...and tell them I don't have
an anger problem if you want.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.972
I can't just sign your papers.

10:17.149 --> 10:19.344
I didn't do anything wrong.
You know that.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.213
All right.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.018
How's this?

10:25.191 --> 10:26.624
Just hang for one session...

10:26.792 --> 10:30.387
...so I can at least say
I gave you a proper analysis.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.555
- Then I'll sign your papers.
- Okay.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.628
- Shall we?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

10:37.803 --> 10:37.970
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.770
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.205
And I was like, you know,
"Don't go there."

10:44.477 --> 10:48.140
But he kept on about wanting to see
a doctor's note or something.

10:48.314 --> 10:52.045
And I said, "Look, I'm seriously
serious. You don't want to go there."

10:52.318 --> 10:55.651
But he kept talking and talking,
being such a nag...

10:55.821 --> 10:58.221
...and then I just blacked out.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.551
I blacked out.

10:59.725 --> 11:03.320
And when I woke up, I was standing
over him and I was screaming:

11:03.496 --> 11:08.229
"I told you not to go there!
I told you not to go there!"

11:10.069 --> 11:12.367
How do you feel you
handled that situation?

11:13.706 --> 11:15.264
Not as well as I could've.

11:15.441 --> 11:20.708
Remember, Lou, temper's the one
thing you can't get rid of by losing it.

11:23.215 --> 11:26.378
Now, Fury Fighters, let's say hello
to someone...

11:26.552 --> 11:30.716
...who's joining our quest to get
the anger monkeys off our backs:

11:30.890 --> 11:32.983
- Dave.
- Hi, Dave.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.148
Hi.

11:34.894 --> 11:38.523
Good news, I fed my anger monkey
a banana this morning...

11:38.698 --> 11:40.290
...and he's feeling much better.

11:42.902 --> 11:46.338
More good news, you won't have to
listen to those lame jokes...

11:46.505 --> 11:48.530
...because I'm only here
for one session.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.974
Dave assaulted a female
flight attendant in midair.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.544
- Nice.
- I bet you beat her good.

11:57.016 --> 12:00.179
I didn't beat anybody.
I touched a woman.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.377
Liar. Bullshitter.
You're a woman beater.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.422
You can't admit it because you're
a piece of garbage.

12:05.591 --> 12:09.994
I don't know about all that,
but now I understand why you're here.

12:11.263 --> 12:14.061
I'm here because I was verbally
attacked by my neighbor.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.701
And I took a dump on his porch.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.630
I guess you're better than me.
That's why you can't cop to your rage.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.433
You're superior. He's superior.

12:22.608 --> 12:26.601
- Maybe Dave's not ready yet, Chuck.
- You're not ready. Hear what he said?

12:26.846 --> 12:29.280
Let's introduce Dave
to some of the rest of us.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.281
Girls, why don't you tell Dave
what brought you here.

12:32.451 --> 12:36.251
I'm sure he'd love to listen
to what you guys have to say.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.855
We always do.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.426
- Come on, Dave. Join us.
- Okay.

12:44.163 --> 12:47.360
Okay. Well, we're
in the adult film industry.

12:47.533 --> 12:48.693
And we're lovers.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.837
One day, Gina was having sex
with this Filipino guy Melo...

12:52.004 --> 12:55.064
- ...which was cool, it was in the script.
- Sure.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.732
And then I asked Melo
back to the house with us...

12:57.910 --> 13:01.346
...which is cool, because,
well, we like a little variety.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.237
Variety's good.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.042
So anyway, in the middle
of our session...

13:06.218 --> 13:09.187
...I look up and I see Gina
kissing Melo on the mouth...

13:09.355 --> 13:12.916
...which is not cool because it
violates our threesome code of ethics.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.424
- Stacy bit my toe off.
- Then Melo freaks out...

13:15.761 --> 13:19.128
- ...and calls me a crazy skank.
- Nobody talks to my bitch that way.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.493
- So I stapled his lips shut.
- Here we are.

13:23.202 --> 13:25.693
Well, we've all been there.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.940
- I like him.
- Yeah, he's funny.

13:30.209 --> 13:31.574
Not as funny as you.

13:34.446 --> 13:35.708
I like that.

13:37.783 --> 13:41.241
- All right, girls.
- Let it go. Let it go a little bit longer.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.709
Walk it off.

13:45.424 --> 13:49.554
Nate. Didn't we decide that you
shouldn't listen to the ball game?

13:49.762 --> 13:53.220
Don't worry, Dr. B, it's just a regular
season game. Not important.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.128
He missed the lay-up!

13:55.334 --> 13:58.599
See? Iverson just missed a lay-up
at the buzzer, Sixers lose.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.238
Who gives a crap, huh?

14:00.406 --> 14:02.670
I mean, it's just a silly game, anyways.

14:07.413 --> 14:10.405
The anger sharks are swimming
in my head.

14:10.816 --> 14:12.340
You gotta dunk that shit!

14:12.518 --> 14:14.679
You gotta dunk that shit!

14:14.854 --> 14:16.719
Listen to me. Stay with me, Nate.

14:16.989 --> 14:18.854
Now, repeat after me, Nate:

14:19.024 --> 14:21.254
Goosfraba.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.292
Goos blah blah.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.953
Not "blah blah," Nate.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.664
Goosfraba.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.428
Goosfraba.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.333
That's good. Slower.

14:33.505 --> 14:37.236
Goosfraba.

14:37.409 --> 14:38.569
How do you feel?

14:39.178 --> 14:40.167
Better.

14:42.948 --> 14:44.438
Good job, Nate.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.279
That sound is a derivation
of an old Eskimo word...

14:47.453 --> 14:49.819
...that mothers used to calm
their children.

14:49.989 --> 14:52.048
- I see.
- Eskimos seem nice.

14:52.224 --> 14:55.022
- They do.
- I think Eskimos are smug.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.627
Hold that thought, Chuck.

14:57.263 --> 14:58.821
So, Dave...

14:59.398 --> 15:00.831
...tell us about yourself.

15:01.000 --> 15:01.989
Who are you?

15:02.468 --> 15:05.369
Well, I am an executive assistant...

15:05.537 --> 15:07.869
...at a major pet products company.

15:09.208 --> 15:13.008
I don't want you to tell us what you do.
I want you to tell us who you are.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.113
All right.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.312
I'm a pretty good guy.

15:18.817 --> 15:21.377
I like playing tennis on occasion....

15:21.654 --> 15:24.817
Also, not your hobbies, Dave,
just simple:

15:24.990 --> 15:26.514
Tell us who you are.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.158
I just....

15:30.362 --> 15:34.526
Maybe you could give me an example
of what a good answer would be.

15:34.700 --> 15:35.826
What did you say?

15:36.902 --> 15:39.302
You want Lou to tell you who you are?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.234
No, I just....

15:45.644 --> 15:48.477
I'm a nice, easygoing man.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.906
I might be a little bit
indecisive at times.

15:52.084 --> 15:55.451
Dave, you're describing
your personality.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.952
I want to know...

15:57.790 --> 16:00.884
- ...who you are.
- What the hell do you want me to say?

16:06.198 --> 16:09.656
I mean, I'm sorry. I just....
I want to answer your question.

16:09.835 --> 16:12.929
I'm just not doing it right, I guess.

16:13.105 --> 16:16.905
I think we're getting a picture, Dave.

16:17.076 --> 16:20.011
- Let's move on.
- Dr. Rydell, I'd like to know something.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.340
Why is it that Chuck
thinks he can smoke?

16:22.514 --> 16:26.109
I do whatever I want when I want,
you little Spanish fruit topping.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.151
Honey, at least I didn't
make my aunt pregnant.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.956
What are you laughing at, Dave?

16:36.562 --> 16:39.793
Just laughing. I don't know.
I'm not laughing at you.

16:39.965 --> 16:43.162
Were you laughing with me?
Because I'm not laughing.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.501
Am I out of line,
or is this guy pushing me?

16:47.306 --> 16:49.240
Well, how do you feel, Chuck?

16:49.475 --> 16:53.468
I went from happy to angry, skipped
sad. Now I feel like kicking his ass.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.370
Then we'll see who's laughing.

16:55.547 --> 16:58.983
What? Think you're better than me
because you've got both your nuts?

16:59.752 --> 17:03.415
All right, man. All right. Come on.
Come on, big boy. Pretty boy.

17:04.890 --> 17:09.190
All right. Is it worth going back
to the penitentiary, Chuck?

17:09.361 --> 17:12.592
- So he's laughing at you.
- I'm not laughing at him.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.068
Goosfraba.

17:23.275 --> 17:26.175
- Goosfraba.
- Okay.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.973
Good job, Chuck.
That was really good.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.183
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

17:33.184 --> 17:34.618
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.551
I haven't been to the Actors Studio
in quite some time.

17:37.756 --> 17:40.623
- I'm sure your audition will go well.
- Thanks. I hope so.

17:40.793 --> 17:41.987
- Good night.
- All right.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.423
- Thanks, Buddy.
- Bye-bye.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.790
That was a little bit insane.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.228
If I had to do 20 hours of that,
I'd end up killing myself.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.390
Here you go.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.537
Twenty hours in my class
would be pointless for you.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.964
I agree.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.699
I think I'm going to recommend
to the court that we double your time.

17:59.311 --> 18:00.539
What do you mean?

18:00.712 --> 18:02.270
Let me explain something.

18:02.614 --> 18:06.243
There are two kinds of angry people:
explosive and implosive.

18:06.618 --> 18:10.452
Explosive is the kind of individual that
you see screaming at the cashier...

18:10.622 --> 18:12.487
...for not taking their coupons.

18:12.791 --> 18:17.421
Implosive is the cashier
who remains quiet, day after day...

18:17.629 --> 18:21.087
...and finally shoots everyone
in the store.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.858
You're the cashier.

18:23.135 --> 18:27.970
No. I'm the guy hiding in the frozen
food section dialing 911, I swear.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.265
I'm going to assign you an anger ally...

18:30.476 --> 18:32.967
...to help calm you down
when you're losing it.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.234
Chuck.

18:34.513 --> 18:37.243
Not Chuck. Give me Bobby Knight,
or the porno girls.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.213
Heard we're partnering up, huh?

18:39.518 --> 18:41.008
- Yes.
- Here's my number.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.745
Great. "You're going to die, bitch."

18:44.156 --> 18:46.818
Oops, that's a letter I'm writing
to Geraldo Rivera.

18:47.025 --> 18:48.583
- I see.
- My bad. Here.

18:48.827 --> 18:51.159
That's the number. Good. Thank you.

18:53.098 --> 18:55.726
Dave and Chuck...

18:56.969 --> 19:00.200
...working together as a team.

19:00.739 --> 19:04.903
- It's a win-win situation.
- Yeah, feels it.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.908
Dave's particulars.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.969
I'll see you soon.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.749
The Yanks are great this season.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.358
Dave thinks they could beat Seattle's
win record.

19:21.593 --> 19:24.926
Remember at Brown when we
saw Ron Guidry win his 20th?

19:25.130 --> 19:26.927
Oh, man. He was on fire that year.

19:27.132 --> 19:28.258
We could've been too.

19:28.467 --> 19:31.732
Andrew, don't start or I can't
hang out with you anymore.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.998
Sorry, it's just hard. I'll never meet
anyone as good as you.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.867
You will. She'll be a very lucky lady.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.637
Thanks for being my best friend.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.708
Linda.

19:43.882 --> 19:46.043
- Hey, Dave.
- Andrew.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.809
Good to see you guys hugging.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.588
How was the doctor?

19:51.323 --> 19:52.756
Psychotic.

19:52.991 --> 19:56.552
Well, did you get any good
promotion news from Mr. Head?

19:56.762 --> 19:59.663
I wasn't able to talk to him
about that yet, but I will.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.996
Not that crowded here.
You'd think it would be packed.

20:04.169 --> 20:08.299
I rented the place. I figured it'd be
more fun if it was just Brown alumni.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.805
Where'd you go to college again?

20:10.976 --> 20:12.671
Trenton Community College.

20:14.846 --> 20:18.077
You had a hard day.
Let me buy you a milk shake.

20:18.850 --> 20:19.976
Later, Andrew.

20:20.185 --> 20:23.313
... once you cast your line in,
so during retrieval...

20:23.488 --> 20:26.423
...it'll help you to create a realistic
and a erratic....

20:28.927 --> 20:30.019
Hey, Dave.

20:30.262 --> 20:33.925
- Hey. Andrew, what's up?
- Not much.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.699
You always try to simulate live bait.

20:36.935 --> 20:41.429
Okay, they got fishing while you
go to the bathroom. That's nice.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.801
Yep. Bass fishing.
Hey, he caught one.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.373
Be aware of your presentation...

20:46.545 --> 20:50.276
...and make sure that,
as you work it along....

20:50.649 --> 20:51.775
Oh, yeah.

20:54.653 --> 20:56.018
Congratulations.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.884
Now that is a big one, folks.

21:04.863 --> 21:06.728
Always a blast being with your friends.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.365
It was a great night.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.524
Yankees winning, beer and hot dogs.

21:10.802 --> 21:13.862
Yeah, you like those foot-long
hot dogs, don't you?

21:15.040 --> 21:19.807
So I saw your boy Andrew
at the urinal.

21:20.245 --> 21:21.644
Saw his...

21:22.314 --> 21:24.509
- ...thing.
- You were looking?

21:24.716 --> 21:26.479
Yeah, unfortunately.

21:26.718 --> 21:31.212
So, now, did this guy grow up near
a nuclear power plant or something?

21:31.556 --> 21:33.114
What are you talking about?

21:33.292 --> 21:37.695
Never really seen nothing like that
before. Didn't it used to scare you?

21:37.863 --> 21:38.852
I never saw it.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.856
You never saw it?

21:41.133 --> 21:44.625
No, I told you, I never slept with him.
Why, is it huge?

21:45.304 --> 21:47.033
No. No. No. No.

21:47.239 --> 21:50.697
It's actually quite petite.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.910
I felt bad for him.

21:53.378 --> 21:56.745
It looked like it belonged on a baby
and it had a funny color.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.577
I bet he got a lot of snickers
in the locker room.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.753
Like, "What the hell's that thing?"

22:02.921 --> 22:06.254
When you're in a locker room,
you must feel good about yourself.

22:06.425 --> 22:11.226
I do. If there are 20 naked guys
in there, I'm usually in the top 18.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.998
- Which isn't bad.
- You're doing really good.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.497
Thanks.

22:19.671 --> 22:23.072
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Let me get rid of them.

22:24.776 --> 22:27.904
- Hello?
- Dave, it's me, Chuck.

22:28.413 --> 22:30.643
- Who's Chuck?
- Your anger ally.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.681
I'm in a mood, Dave. A bad mood.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.283
A very bad mood.

22:34.453 --> 22:37.980
I was fired from my ice-cream truck job
today. No more Fudgeicles.

22:38.590 --> 22:40.922
- What's an anger ally?
- Who's that?

22:41.259 --> 22:42.317
She making fun of me?

22:43.428 --> 22:45.623
No. That's my girlfriend.

22:45.797 --> 22:49.927
You tell her to put a sock in it because
I need to talk to you right now!

22:50.502 --> 22:52.333
We're a little busy right now.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.596
You're busy? We're all busy, okay?

22:54.973 --> 22:58.431
You come down here before
a black wolf swallows my brain!

23:08.120 --> 23:11.487
After I got kicked out of the Army,
I went through a real bad time:

23:11.656 --> 23:16.218
Hookers, booze, shooting holes in the
ceiling, screaming myself to sleep.

23:16.995 --> 23:19.395
Finally, my parents said I
had to move out.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.463
I'm guessing that's when you decided
to shack up with your aunt.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.766
Don't get cute, wiseass!

23:26.471 --> 23:27.495
But, yes.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.199
What's with the watch, huh?
Am I boring you?

23:31.376 --> 23:36.245
We ordered the drinks 15 minutes ago
and I kind of gotta get back.

23:36.948 --> 23:38.415
Miss? Excuse me, miss?

23:38.617 --> 23:41.415
Is this Slow And Stupid Waitress Day?

23:41.586 --> 23:43.679
I'm sorry. I be right with you.

23:44.055 --> 23:47.320
Damn, man, reminds me
of these chicks back in the war.

23:47.492 --> 23:50.393
Would give you the old licky-licky,
then fry your banana.

23:50.595 --> 23:51.584
Settle.

23:51.763 --> 23:56.223
I have seen some shit, man.
I kid you not, I have seen some shit.

23:57.536 --> 24:01.404
Wake up to the sound
of kids screaming.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.570
Explosions everywhere.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.775
Never know when your number's up.

24:06.978 --> 24:08.707
Vietnam, huh?

24:10.415 --> 24:12.815
- Grenada, man.
- Grenada?

24:14.119 --> 24:15.916
Wasn't that like 12 hours long?

24:20.725 --> 24:21.714
Did you see that?

24:22.227 --> 24:25.993
- See what?
- That guy. He just gave me a look.

24:27.699 --> 24:28.996
He didn't give you a look.

24:29.234 --> 24:33.170
And I'm pretty sure I heard him mutter
some kind of anti-Semitic remark.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.634
Are you Jewish?

24:36.308 --> 24:39.573
I could be. But, no. Half Irish,
half Italian, half Mexican.

24:41.279 --> 24:43.304
Let's go give those guys some tsuris.

24:43.949 --> 24:46.474
Well, the guy on the left is blind,
Chuck.

24:46.751 --> 24:48.480
I hear you.

24:48.920 --> 24:49.909
He's yours.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.085
No. That's not what I was saying.

24:53.625 --> 24:54.649
- Hey.
- What the hell?

24:54.826 --> 24:56.487
Got something against guys with hair?

24:56.661 --> 24:57.650
What's going on?

25:03.869 --> 25:05.461
Don't! Stop it! Stop!

25:05.637 --> 25:07.764
Stop! Goosfraba!

25:07.939 --> 25:08.928
You piece of shit!

25:16.915 --> 25:18.849
Stop it! Stop it!

25:22.821 --> 25:24.288
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.

25:24.856 --> 25:28.587
I see you've managed to brutalize
a cocktail waitress this time.

25:29.194 --> 25:32.652
I guess beating up stewardesses
can get old after a while.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.957
Flight attendant, Your Honor.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.259
I didn't hit her on purpose,
Your Honor.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.495
I was being attacked by someone...

25:40.705 --> 25:43.299
...and while I was
trying to take away his....

25:43.508 --> 25:44.941
His....

25:45.143 --> 25:47.805
Trying to take away my cane,
Your Honor.

25:49.314 --> 25:52.112
You cracked a waitress in the face...

25:52.317 --> 25:54.979
...while attempting to steal
a blind man's cane?

25:55.453 --> 25:59.150
Your Honor, we're not even sure
how blind this man really is.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.691
Okay. My bad. Moving on.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.126
Happy now, ass-wipe?

26:10.468 --> 26:13.733
Mr. Buznik, I don't know
why you hate women.

26:13.972 --> 26:15.633
Maybe you don't know either...

26:15.840 --> 26:20.834
...but I'll let you think about it while
you spend one year in a state prison.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.513
- Isn't that a bit harsh, Your Honor?
- No!

26:24.182 --> 26:25.171
Okay.

26:28.687 --> 26:32.316
- May I approach, Your Honor?
- By all means, Dr. Rydell.

26:32.490 --> 26:33.514
Thank you.

26:43.001 --> 26:45.162
- It's been a while.
- Yes, it has.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.999
- You look marvelous, Brenda.
- Thank you.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.868
- And how are the boys?
- Fantastic.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.942
James made the basketball team,
Raheem landed the lead...

26:53.111 --> 26:54.601
...in Fiddler on the Roof.

26:54.779 --> 26:58.374
Raheem will make
a breathtaking Tevye, I'm sure.

26:59.050 --> 27:02.918
So do you have a take
on this Buznik guy?

27:03.121 --> 27:04.850
Is this good or bad?

27:05.423 --> 27:08.017
Well, it's bad that he's
talking to her...

27:08.226 --> 27:09.853
...but it's good that....

27:11.196 --> 27:13.858
No, it's bad. It's all bad.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.757
- You think you can help him?
- I think so, Your Honor.

27:18.036 --> 27:23.030
If I can't, I'll tear him apart
with my bare hands.

27:30.882 --> 27:31.906
Mr. Buznik...

27:32.117 --> 27:35.575
...because of the enormous respect
I have for Dr. Rydell...

27:35.754 --> 27:38.723
...I'm placing you in his intensive
anger management program...

27:38.890 --> 27:40.221
...for 30 days.

27:40.625 --> 27:44.652
But if you fail to strictly adhere
to the rules of his program...

27:44.829 --> 27:47.764
...you will spend the next year
in state prison.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.537
- Buddy?
- Good evening. Ready to get it on?

28:03.715 --> 28:05.342
Get what on?
What are you doing here?

28:05.517 --> 28:06.950
Well, well, well.

28:07.118 --> 28:08.483
The lair of the rage rhino.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.622
I smell the effluvium
of pain and frustration.

28:11.823 --> 28:14.018
- Where should we put my stuff?
- What stuff?

28:14.426 --> 28:16.917
We've got 30 days
to control your anger.

28:17.128 --> 28:19.688
My approach dictates
intense observation.

28:19.931 --> 28:22.764
What better vantage point
than bunkmates?

28:23.501 --> 28:25.662
Put that there, Dan,
thank you very much.

28:25.870 --> 28:31.103
No. No. I'm sorry. Guys, I don't think
you should be moving in with me.

28:31.342 --> 28:32.502
Sit down, Dave.

28:34.946 --> 28:36.846
Let's be perfectly clear about this.

28:37.182 --> 28:39.309
You've been deemed
a threat to society.

28:39.517 --> 28:41.849
I believe that radical,
round-the-clock therapy...

28:42.020 --> 28:45.114
...is the only way to effect
a meaningful and positive change...

28:45.290 --> 28:46.348
...in your behavior.

28:46.591 --> 28:48.650
Now we can do it here
or Rikers Island.

28:48.860 --> 28:51.158
- Anything else, Dr. B?
- No thanks, Dan.

28:51.362 --> 28:53.694
We'll install the wiretaps tomorrow.

28:53.898 --> 28:54.887
Wiretaps?

28:55.133 --> 28:57.567
- Is this your CD collection?
- Yes.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.732
Oh, my.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.197
What are you doing?

29:03.374 --> 29:06.571
I don't want you listening
to any angry music.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.542
The Carpenters are angry?
I mean....

29:09.647 --> 29:11.205
Don't be naive, Dave.

29:11.549 --> 29:14.541
"Close to You."
"We've Only Just Begun."

29:14.753 --> 29:17.483
Songs of madness and obsession.

29:18.723 --> 29:20.486
Who's going to pay for that?

29:20.692 --> 29:25.652
Retard your anger level a few notches
and listen to me. Can you do that?

29:26.064 --> 29:28.862
Yeah. It's retarded. I'm retarded.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.061
Good.

29:31.236 --> 29:34.899
Now then, we need to go over
some ground rules.

29:37.742 --> 29:39.835
My girlfriend got me that.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.977
You're to refrain from violent acts
including verbal assault...

29:45.150 --> 29:46.583
...and vulgar hand gestures.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.515
You may not use rage-enhancing
substances...

29:49.687 --> 29:53.418
...such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol,
crack cocaine...

29:53.625 --> 29:56.219
...Slippy-Flippies, Jelly Stingers,
Trick Sticks...

29:56.394 --> 29:58.191
...Bing Bangs or Flying Willards.

29:58.396 --> 30:01.092
- How about Fiddle Faddles?
- Under my supervision.

30:01.566 --> 30:04.296
Also, if you are unable
to stop masturbating...

30:04.469 --> 30:07.927
...please do so without the use
of any pornographic images...

30:08.139 --> 30:11.768
...depicting quote-unquote
"angry sex."

30:11.976 --> 30:15.434
That having been said,
I'm a pretty good guy...

30:15.613 --> 30:17.581
...and I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised...

30:17.749 --> 30:19.649
...at how much fun we can have.

30:19.818 --> 30:24.187
Jeez, without Slippy-Flippies or angry
masturbating? How is that possible?

30:24.355 --> 30:28.553
Sarcasm is anger's ugly cousin.
From now on, unacceptable.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.325
Dave, I got this for you.

30:31.563 --> 30:34.088
It's a wonderfully therapeutic tool.

30:34.299 --> 30:37.097
Record your thoughts on this
whenever you feel angry.

30:38.403 --> 30:40.633
I'm feeling very angry right now...

30:40.805 --> 30:43.899
...because I only have one bed
and no couch.

30:44.108 --> 30:45.473
Not a problem.

30:47.912 --> 30:53.248
In Europe, it's not considered unusual
for three or four men to share a bed.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.918
Yeah, well, that's why I'm
proud to be an American.

30:59.257 --> 31:00.588
By the way....

31:06.297 --> 31:08.424
I like to sleep in the nude.

31:44.969 --> 31:46.596
You hear that frog?

31:47.305 --> 31:48.294
Nope.

32:06.157 --> 32:07.146
What do you want?

32:07.358 --> 32:10.156
I'm just recording your demeanor
upon awakening.

32:11.396 --> 32:14.331
Good to see you got your underwear
back on.

32:14.999 --> 32:16.091
6:30?

32:16.334 --> 32:18.199
I don't gotta be up till 7.

32:18.403 --> 32:20.166
You've got to make my breakfast.

32:21.339 --> 32:24.502
Dave, cooking is very relaxing
and therapeutic.

32:25.009 --> 32:28.410
I want two eggs,
over easy and unfertilized...

32:28.613 --> 32:30.945
...wheat toast, dry, and please...

32:31.115 --> 32:32.776
...tell me you've got ketchup.

32:33.017 --> 32:35.042
There's a Denny's down the street.

32:35.253 --> 32:36.618
Not only do they have ketchup...

32:36.788 --> 32:39.348
...but they got the angriest waitresses
I've seen.

32:39.524 --> 32:42.857
You could have a blast with
the goosfraba thing down there.

32:43.194 --> 32:44.218
Lame-o.

33:06.451 --> 33:07.509
Your eggs.

33:16.394 --> 33:20.057
- Holy shit!
- I said over easy!!

33:25.436 --> 33:26.801
Now, why did I do that?

33:27.405 --> 33:30.397
Because I refused to spoon with you
last night?

33:32.276 --> 33:36.144
The angry man opens his mouth
and shuts his eyes.

33:37.749 --> 33:38.977
Alpha-Bits.

33:39.250 --> 33:43.516
No matter how old I get,
always a culinary delight.

33:43.755 --> 33:47.282
No explanation for the egg throwing.
He's a psycho.

33:47.792 --> 33:51.125
Don't sulk, Dave. Eat. Sit down.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.260
We'll be off to work in a jiffy.

33:54.465 --> 33:59.266
"We'll be off to work." Now, by "we'll,"
I assume you mean just me, right?

33:59.437 --> 34:01.962
Well, I have to join you at work.

34:02.173 --> 34:03.435
Full contact.

34:03.975 --> 34:07.467
That will make me look nuts, Buddy,
bringing a shrink to work...

34:07.678 --> 34:09.976
...you whipping eggs at people.
I don't know.

34:10.214 --> 34:14.206
You must never be ashamed that you
sought help for yourself, Dave.

34:14.418 --> 34:15.976
It's not a weakness.

34:18.822 --> 34:20.723
I mean, I gotta be there by 9:00.

34:20.925 --> 34:23.985
I don't think we'll make it on time.
You're not even dressed.

34:24.161 --> 34:27.154
The Talmud says:
"Wherever you look...

34:28.166 --> 34:30.157
...there's something to be seen."

34:31.034 --> 34:32.331
Look, Dave.

34:44.614 --> 34:47.516
- What exactly was that all about?
- What?

34:47.685 --> 34:51.348
You just ran through a red light.
Are you trying to get us both killed?

34:51.522 --> 34:55.356
I'm a little flustered right now.
I have to be to work in eight minutes.

34:55.960 --> 34:56.949
Flustered?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.999
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, man!

35:03.267 --> 35:07.169
- Holy shit! What are you doing?
- I need you to unfluster.

35:07.705 --> 35:10.936
My boss is going to go nuts on me
if we're late, so please?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.475
We will proceed when you are centered.

35:13.644 --> 35:15.009
I'm centered, I'm centered.

35:15.179 --> 35:18.012
There's 10,000 people behind us.
Let's go, crazy man.

35:20.651 --> 35:23.245
What is that? Is that good?

35:23.654 --> 35:25.246
We're going to sing a song.

35:25.690 --> 35:29.524
No. I don't want to sing a song.
I want to go to.... I've gotta go.

35:29.727 --> 35:30.853
Here we go.

35:31.028 --> 35:34.759
The magic of Leonard Bernstein
and Stephen Sondheim's...

35:34.966 --> 35:37.560
...West Side Story.

35:39.237 --> 35:40.795
"I Feel Pretty."

35:41.906 --> 35:44.204
Get this moving.
What the hell's your problem?

35:44.375 --> 35:46.935
Shut your pie-hole!
We're working here!

35:47.378 --> 35:48.606
Wow. Sorry.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.170
Move your ass, dipshit!

36:58.983 --> 37:00.143
Burn in hell!

37:15.433 --> 37:16.593
Yes!

37:20.371 --> 37:22.339
You feel stunning.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.337
And entrancing.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.457
You're late.

37:44.662 --> 37:48.098
Yes. There was a little bit
of a tie up on the bridge.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.258
I didn't ask for a traffic report.
You're always late.

37:51.435 --> 37:54.871
Now is the first time I've been late.
But you're right. I'm sorry.

37:55.039 --> 37:56.267
May I interject?

37:56.641 --> 38:00.099
You were about to say something else
before you said, "I'm sorry."

38:00.278 --> 38:02.269
We mustn't absorb and repress.

38:02.446 --> 38:06.246
- Who's this?
- I'm his anger management therapist.

38:06.851 --> 38:08.682
You're in anger management?

38:10.221 --> 38:12.621
Temporarily, yeah.

38:12.957 --> 38:16.017
Do you remember the flight
to St. Louis...

38:16.227 --> 38:19.492
...that I was on when they had to
turn the plane around?

38:19.664 --> 38:22.462
Yeah, yeah. Because of that unruly
passenger in coach.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.123
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

38:24.302 --> 38:26.566
He doesn't like people
touching his clubs.

38:28.773 --> 38:31.765
Well, that unruly passenger was me.

38:31.942 --> 38:36.436
I got arrested at Kennedy. That's why
I didn't make the next flight.

38:37.081 --> 38:39.276
You said your apartment caught fire.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.647
Dissembling is a common tool
of the anger junkie.

38:43.821 --> 38:47.416
Might I have your first name,
Mr. Head? And tell me it isn't Dick.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.822
- It's Frank.
- Fran.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.826
Isn't that normally a girl's name?

38:55.666 --> 38:57.258
What went on on that flight?

38:57.668 --> 39:00.603
To be honest with you,
it was a mix-up. I....

39:00.838 --> 39:03.204
Jibber jabber. Jibber jabbering.
Mumbo jumbo.

39:03.374 --> 39:05.865
Denial. Key, key, key, key, key, key.

39:06.043 --> 39:09.342
Fran, your assistant beat the bejesus
out of a flight attendant.

39:09.513 --> 39:11.208
- I didn't.
- You broke her nose.

39:11.382 --> 39:13.441
I broke the cocktail waitress's nose.

39:14.919 --> 39:17.547
I mean, I accidentally did that.

39:17.722 --> 39:19.747
Dave, you have a disease.

39:19.924 --> 39:23.690
Would you apologize if you
were a diabetic? Of course not.

39:23.861 --> 39:27.957
Why do you feel you have to apologize
because you're suffering from T.A.S.?

39:29.033 --> 39:30.022
T.A.S.?

39:30.201 --> 39:31.896
Toxic Anger Syndrome.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.736
I don't have T.A.S.

39:34.905 --> 39:38.033
He's angry. It's a sickness,
not a crime, Fran.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.733
His name is Frank!

39:43.881 --> 39:46.315
No. I'm sorry.

39:58.662 --> 40:01.256
Clothes for cats
isn't really a new idea...

40:01.432 --> 40:05.095
...but there was never really a line
made for overweight cats...

40:05.269 --> 40:08.204
...who might feel a little
self-conscious...

40:08.372 --> 40:10.465
...about how they look
in certain outfits.

40:10.641 --> 40:13.906
That's why I got the baggy sweater
on him, to cover up his gut.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.911
And the beret to take attention
off his plump head.

40:17.081 --> 40:21.074
Oh, little Meatball.
You tie this up tight...

40:21.252 --> 40:23.584
...and away goes the chin.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.483
I'm so handsome.

40:28.659 --> 40:32.459
- Hey, Dave. This is your office?
- Andrew.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.224
- What are you doing here?
- I played golf with Frank.

40:35.599 --> 40:38.898
He's friends with my dad. We're
members of the same country club.

40:39.069 --> 40:42.095
Really? I've been wanting to play golf
with him a long time.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.241
- Is it awesome there?
- It's nice.

40:49.113 --> 40:52.276
So, anyway, Dave, how's
anger management going?

40:53.284 --> 40:54.649
Who told you about that?

40:54.819 --> 40:57.413
Linda's my best friend.
There's no secrets between us.

40:57.588 --> 41:01.217
For the love of Mike!
This guy's your girl's best friend?

41:01.459 --> 41:04.292
No. I mean, I like to consider myself
her best friend...

41:04.495 --> 41:09.296
...but Andrew is her best friend friend,
if that makes any sense.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.595
You ought to golf yourself.
You look a little stressed out.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.162
I gotta go. Bye.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.676
Well, well, well.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.209
This guy's got quite a basket on him.

41:24.381 --> 41:26.508
Really? I didn't notice that.

41:26.884 --> 41:30.342
Do you really want the love of your life
hanging around with a guy...

41:30.521 --> 41:34.082
...who looks as though he could satisfy
a blue whale?

41:34.558 --> 41:37.584
Well, it's....
I'm doing okay myself, pal.

41:37.928 --> 41:40.396
Maybe it's the way his pants fit him.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.425
What's up?

41:44.902 --> 41:47.496
- This is your young lady?
- That's my Linda.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.764
My, oh, my.

41:50.841 --> 41:54.277
I was toying with the notion
that you were gay...

41:54.445 --> 41:56.811
...because of the kitty-cat clothes,
so forth.

41:57.815 --> 41:58.975
What does she do?

41:59.483 --> 42:03.351
She teaches poetry. Poetry teacher.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.518
I love poetry.

42:07.591 --> 42:10.355
Oh, my, my, my. It's....

42:10.861 --> 42:13.523
Yes, it's a good picture of her.

42:16.767 --> 42:20.533
Well, apparently Dr. Rydell has a
history of unorthodox techniques.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.535
He's got a dozen lawsuits pending.

42:22.706 --> 42:25.266
So it's not just me.
This guy is nuts, isn't he?

42:25.442 --> 42:26.466
Or a genius.

42:26.644 --> 42:32.105
But if you could prove that he's nuts:
audiotape, video, picture, whatever...

42:32.283 --> 42:33.841
...I'll arrange a hearing.

42:36.353 --> 42:38.184
I gotta go. I think he's coming.

42:46.196 --> 42:47.458
Hi, Nancy.

42:47.631 --> 42:49.531
What are you doing
in the ladies' room?

42:50.134 --> 42:54.298
Sorry. I just heard you guys
got cleaner seats than us.

42:54.939 --> 42:56.964
Not after I get through with them.

43:00.177 --> 43:04.204
I don't care for the way you've
ironed my shirts, Dave. Try it again.

43:04.381 --> 43:08.442
- I've been very patient with you.
- Beware the fury of the patient man.

43:08.619 --> 43:11.213
- I'm serious!
- Too serious.

43:11.422 --> 43:12.912
Get undressed.

43:13.490 --> 43:15.151
What did you say?

43:16.560 --> 43:17.652
Take off your clothes.

43:17.828 --> 43:20.388
I've got a stress-reduction technique
to show you.

43:20.564 --> 43:23.499
- It'll be good for you.
- Take off my clothes?

43:23.667 --> 43:25.897
Do you want to see me naked, Buddy?

43:28.339 --> 43:30.000
Are you a homophobe, Dave?

43:30.174 --> 43:35.339
No, I'm a pulling-my-penis-out-
in-front-of-you-a-phobe.

43:36.447 --> 43:39.314
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

43:53.030 --> 43:54.759
- What's up, baby?
- Why are we here?

43:54.932 --> 43:56.297
I'm not a homophobe.

43:56.467 --> 43:59.231
My lawyer's gay. His boyfriend is gay.

43:59.403 --> 44:01.894
And are they all aware
that you despise them?

44:02.339 --> 44:04.398
Looking for company, baby?

44:04.575 --> 44:06.406
No. We're not. Thank you.

44:06.577 --> 44:08.238
It's worth 50 bucks...

44:08.412 --> 44:13.179
...if you get in the back seat with
my friend here and have a little chat.

44:13.350 --> 44:15.079
My pleasure, Mr. Eyebrows.

44:17.187 --> 44:18.916
Oh, boy, here we go.

44:22.026 --> 44:24.586
- Hello.
- Hey. Good to see you.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.655
- What's your name, baby?
- Melvin.

44:28.832 --> 44:31.426
His name is David. Don't dissemble.

44:31.602 --> 44:35.003
I'm not dissembling.
That's my Hebrew name.

44:35.172 --> 44:38.505
I'm Galaxia. That's my German name.

44:38.709 --> 44:40.006
Great.

44:40.177 --> 44:43.408
Where are you from originally,
Hebrew Melvin?

44:43.580 --> 44:44.672
Brooklyn.

44:45.182 --> 44:48.242
What part of Germany do you hail from?

44:48.419 --> 44:53.015
I'm from a little Bavarian village
called Lickin Zee Dickin.

44:53.190 --> 44:54.214
Care to visit?

44:54.725 --> 44:58.889
Actually, I like to spend
most of my time...

44:59.063 --> 45:01.463
...in Girls Without Wieners-ville.

45:01.865 --> 45:03.799
I'm more comfortable there.

45:06.537 --> 45:09.131
He's just not used to male intimacy.

45:09.440 --> 45:12.603
Well, that's okay, because I'm a lady.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.309
Oops, no, I'm not.

45:14.478 --> 45:15.502
Whoa! There it is.

45:16.447 --> 45:19.245
I feel like dancing. Dancing.

45:21.051 --> 45:22.040
Oh, my God.

45:22.619 --> 45:25.315
What does this have to do
with anger management?

45:25.489 --> 45:29.084
- Oh, are you an angry boy?
- No.

45:29.259 --> 45:30.817
Do you need some discipline?

45:31.028 --> 45:32.222
No, thank you very...

45:32.396 --> 45:34.489
Oh! Hey! Hey, watch that shit!

45:34.732 --> 45:37.997
Listen, ladies! Gentleman! Lentleman!

45:38.168 --> 45:41.296
I'm not having sex with a she-male!
Relax!

45:41.472 --> 45:43.963
Galaxia, you may
get out of the car now.

45:44.141 --> 45:46.735
Your services are no longer required.

45:48.145 --> 45:49.407
You know what?

45:49.813 --> 45:51.508
You guys are freaks.

45:54.251 --> 45:55.809
Give me the tape recorder.

45:58.422 --> 45:59.582
Come on.

46:02.359 --> 46:04.759
Patient number 135, David Buznik...

46:04.928 --> 46:08.694
...has learned the difference between
unhealthy anger and righteous anger.

46:08.866 --> 46:13.394
Thus he has advanced
to the second level of my program.

46:13.604 --> 46:16.004
Great. Can I go throw up now?

46:21.545 --> 46:23.809
I'm a lady. Oops, no, I'm not.

46:23.981 --> 46:26.711
- Whoa, there it is.
- I feel like dancing.

46:26.950 --> 46:30.113
Wasn't that sick?
She looked like Olivia Newton-John...

46:30.287 --> 46:34.121
...if she was really ugly
and had huge balls.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.953
But Buddy didn't order you
to have sex.

46:37.127 --> 46:38.958
I'm getting a call. Please hang on.

46:39.496 --> 46:41.794
- Hello?
- Is Buddy there?

46:42.499 --> 46:44.626
No, he's in the shower right now.

46:44.835 --> 46:46.462
This is Becky, his assistant.

46:46.637 --> 46:48.798
Just tell him his mom called
from Boston.

46:49.006 --> 46:51.998
She said she's having
some minor surgery.

46:52.176 --> 46:57.375
It's not serious, but she'll be at Boston
County Hospital for the next two days.

47:09.226 --> 47:13.856
Miracles of modern science.
I am stimulating my hair follicles...

47:14.031 --> 47:16.226
...and brushing my teeth
at the same time.

47:16.934 --> 47:18.799
It looks really good.

47:21.939 --> 47:22.928
What's the matter?

47:23.273 --> 47:26.902
Your mom. They took her
to the hospital, Buddy.

47:27.511 --> 47:28.978
What's wrong with my mother?

47:29.146 --> 47:32.047
She's having surgery.

47:32.216 --> 47:33.274
I'm sorry.

47:33.450 --> 47:37.113
- Is it serious?
- When is surgery not serious?

47:37.454 --> 47:39.820
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

47:40.023 --> 47:42.958
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

47:43.126 --> 47:46.118
...see what's going on up there.

47:46.296 --> 47:49.754
Yeah. Yeah.
Why don't you just go up there.

47:50.133 --> 47:53.068
Spend some quality time. I'll stay here.

47:53.237 --> 47:54.864
It'll be good for you guys.

47:55.038 --> 47:56.471
Oh, God.

48:01.545 --> 48:05.242
You're all I got, Mom.
Please don't leave me.

48:10.921 --> 48:13.719
No more clam chowder.

48:16.159 --> 48:17.148
Buddy...

48:17.327 --> 48:18.817
...it was a joke.

48:19.429 --> 48:22.023
I'm sorry.
You don't have to cry anymore.

48:24.001 --> 48:25.935
- A joke?
- Yeah.

48:26.169 --> 48:27.761
Oh, boy.

48:28.005 --> 48:30.701
A joke. A jo... I....

48:30.908 --> 48:33.240
I can't believe that I fell for that one.

48:35.412 --> 48:38.142
I really thought my mother
was having surgery.

48:39.650 --> 48:42.050
I'm going to get you back for that one.

48:46.089 --> 48:49.252
Just so you know,
she really is having surgery.

48:52.095 --> 48:54.290
I thought you said you were joking.

48:54.498 --> 48:56.625
No, the serious part was the joke.

48:56.833 --> 49:00.166
She's having surgery,
but just minor surgery.

49:01.104 --> 49:04.505
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

49:04.708 --> 49:07.871
...see what's really going on up there.

49:08.045 --> 49:11.640
Why don't you... ? You just
shoot up there. I'll be here.

49:15.852 --> 49:16.841
What?

49:17.254 --> 49:20.849
- I can't believe he's making me go.
- How come you guys aren't flying?

49:21.024 --> 49:25.085
Because Dr. Cocoa Puff said legally
I'm not allowed to get on a plane.

49:25.262 --> 49:27.958
Meanwhile, I've got Head up my ass
about that catalog.

49:28.131 --> 49:30.895
I've got to get it done with nut-boy
in Boston.

49:31.134 --> 49:33.125
Why can't Head write his own catalog?

49:33.303 --> 49:35.737
Because I've got to earn
that promotion.

49:35.906 --> 49:38.807
You've been doing his job for years.
You should be his...

49:38.976 --> 49:41.877
I'm sorry. I know this is really
stressing you out.

49:42.045 --> 49:45.139
I'm sure that it's going to be over
before you know it.

49:45.315 --> 49:48.478
Yeah, if I don't get caught
popping any Jelly Stingers.

49:48.652 --> 49:50.620
Well, that's going to be tough!

50:01.331 --> 50:03.390
Oh, God. There he is.

50:03.567 --> 50:05.501
- That's him?
- Yes.

50:08.572 --> 50:11.166
What? Oh. Okay, I'll hold that.

50:11.575 --> 50:12.564
My...

50:12.743 --> 50:14.404
The quiet warmth

50:14.578 --> 50:19.311
Smoldering beneath the rituals
Of hope for familiarity

50:19.583 --> 50:22.279
A coursing underground river

50:22.452 --> 50:25.819
Pregnant with the chance currents
Of knowledge and love

50:25.989 --> 50:29.322
- What?
- That's my poem! I wrote that.

50:29.493 --> 50:30.755
I know.

50:30.927 --> 50:33.259
That is your poem. I love that poem.

50:33.430 --> 50:36.024
I found it crumpled up
behind the sports pages...

50:36.199 --> 50:38.292
...on the floor of David's bedroom.

50:39.603 --> 50:44.097
- Shades of early Emily Dickinson.
- Who was great on Police Woman.

50:44.374 --> 50:48.777
Thank you. And thank you
for rescuing it from the floor.

50:50.213 --> 50:52.443
I think I better get going.

50:53.450 --> 50:56.749
I'll miss you, big guy,
so take good care.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.785
- How about a kiss?
- I'd love a kiss.

50:58.955 --> 51:01.719
I think she's talking to me.
I think I can handle it.

51:01.892 --> 51:04.292
So why don't you back up
an inch or two.

51:04.461 --> 51:05.553
Got it.

51:06.730 --> 51:08.493
Thank you. And, take care.

51:08.732 --> 51:10.791
Have a great trip, you guys.

51:10.967 --> 51:12.229
Oh, we will.

51:12.402 --> 51:13.664
Bye.

51:19.910 --> 51:20.934
What?

51:21.111 --> 51:24.444
Some mindless nitwit
is parked behind me.

51:24.648 --> 51:26.115
Good. Then we can't go.

51:26.283 --> 51:27.841
No, I can get out.

51:28.118 --> 51:30.985
- Get in.
- I don't know how you'll get out.

51:31.488 --> 51:35.185
Try to wiggle out, you're going to get
a ding. But you know everything.

51:40.564 --> 51:41.690
What's he doing?

51:50.173 --> 51:53.336
Well, you're batting a thousand...

51:53.543 --> 51:55.272
...in craziness.

51:58.215 --> 52:00.012
Now we're bumping into cars.

52:00.183 --> 52:02.845
I'm just making a little room
to back up.

52:03.019 --> 52:04.987
If I had lost my temper...

52:05.155 --> 52:07.487
...would I have had
the presence of mind...

52:07.657 --> 52:10.626
...to leave my card
and my insurance information?

52:10.794 --> 52:14.389
Whatever, Mr. Insane-Vein-Popping-
A-Little-Too-Far-Out-Of-His-Head-...

52:14.564 --> 52:16.088
...While-Swinging-The-Bat Guy.

52:24.174 --> 52:26.472
I think you've got room to back up.

52:39.222 --> 52:42.020
Why haven't you taken Linda
off the market?

52:42.192 --> 52:43.591
Think you can do better?

52:43.760 --> 52:46.991
I'm going to ask her to marry me
when I'm ready.

52:47.164 --> 52:50.190
Nobody wants to settle down
with a 35-year-old secretary.

52:50.367 --> 52:51.857
Procrastination, Dave.

52:52.035 --> 52:53.468
I'm not procrastinating.

52:53.637 --> 52:56.071
I even think about how I'm
going to pop the question.

52:56.239 --> 52:59.834
Husky down jacket.
Husky Eskimo look.

53:00.010 --> 53:03.844
What's your plan,
ask her at a Yankee game?

53:05.081 --> 53:06.946
Actually, yes. How did you know?

53:07.117 --> 53:09.449
I said the corniest thing
I could think of.

53:09.653 --> 53:12.622
If you knew Linda, you'd know
how uncorny it would be to her.

53:12.789 --> 53:15.485
Putting up a "Marry me, please"
on the scoreboard...

53:15.659 --> 53:18.992
...proclaiming my love for her
in front of thousands of strangers.

53:19.696 --> 53:23.757
As you seem to have noticed, I'm
a little bit jumpy with public affection.

53:24.501 --> 53:26.969
You seemed to be lovey-dovey
back there.

53:28.371 --> 53:31.067
Glad you think that's funny.
I gotta work.

53:48.491 --> 53:50.959
A five-hour trip to find out Mommy
had a jelly bean...

53:51.127 --> 53:52.219
...removed from her nose.

53:52.395 --> 53:54.795
I'm glad I missed work.
Can we eat now?

54:13.116 --> 54:15.084
You could have her, you know.

54:16.987 --> 54:20.150
I'm sure she'd love to hang out
with a goofy secretary...

54:20.323 --> 54:22.883
...whose only talent
is nostril wiggling.

54:23.660 --> 54:25.992
- Girls love that.
- Dave...

54:26.162 --> 54:30.030
...you've got a lot more going for you
than wiggly nostrils.

54:30.233 --> 54:32.997
I want you to go over there
and ask that woman out.

54:33.670 --> 54:34.898
No, I got a girlfriend.

54:35.839 --> 54:40.242
I'm not telling you to elope with her.
Just go over and flirt a little bit.

54:40.410 --> 54:43.379
Flirting is cheating's ugly cousin,
Buddy.

54:43.613 --> 54:45.274
I'm not a cheater.

54:45.615 --> 54:49.142
Is it cheating if you're passed around
the cell block like a peace pipe?

54:49.319 --> 54:54.484
Because that is what's on the docket
for you if you don't go and ask her out.

54:54.658 --> 54:55.852
Okay, Dave?

54:56.826 --> 54:58.020
Oh, God.

55:02.432 --> 55:04.093
That's my boy.

55:08.872 --> 55:10.396
Excuse me.

55:11.541 --> 55:15.272
I was wondering if I could buy you
a drink. I see that you have a drink...

55:15.445 --> 55:18.812
...but I could get you another
when you're through with that one.

55:20.083 --> 55:22.017
Bite me.

55:23.486 --> 55:26.080
Nice meeting you. Okay.

55:30.627 --> 55:32.720
Can you guess why she rejected you?

55:32.896 --> 55:37.162
She wanted to be like the 2000 other
girls who said that to me growing up?

55:37.334 --> 55:39.894
No. Self-hypnotic negative imagery.

55:40.403 --> 55:44.066
Confidence is the key
to winning a young lady's attention.

55:44.941 --> 55:46.909
Now, listen to me very carefully.

55:47.077 --> 55:49.671
- Approach Miss Thing again.
- No.

55:49.913 --> 55:50.937
With confidence.

55:51.114 --> 55:53.241
And if she says no this time...

55:53.416 --> 55:56.749
...I will admit that I am a failure
as a therapist...

55:56.920 --> 55:59.081
...and release you from my program.

55:59.389 --> 56:01.619
You'll release me from your program?

56:10.934 --> 56:13.334
Just go over there
and repeat the following...

56:13.937 --> 56:15.234
...verbatim:

56:15.572 --> 56:18.006
I'm sorry I was so rude before...

56:18.174 --> 56:21.541
...but it's difficult for me
to express myself...

56:21.711 --> 56:25.670
...when I'm on the verge of exploding
in my pants.

56:29.753 --> 56:31.983
- Get out of here.
- Trust me, Dave.

56:32.322 --> 56:35.723
If you are calm as well as witty,
she will respond.

56:35.892 --> 56:39.293
Witty went out the window with
the pants explosion thing, thanks.

56:39.829 --> 56:41.729
My offer stands.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.170
So if I repeat that crazy shit...

56:48.438 --> 56:52.499
...you probably stole from
a porno flick, you sick bastard...

56:52.976 --> 56:54.773
...and get rejected...

56:55.011 --> 56:57.002
...you'll release me from the program?

56:57.680 --> 56:58.669
Exactly.

56:59.349 --> 57:00.907
Here we go.

57:03.820 --> 57:05.845
Go get them, Mr. Johnson.

57:31.514 --> 57:35.974
I'm sorry I was so rude before...

57:37.320 --> 57:42.656
...but it's difficult for me...

57:43.560 --> 57:47.291
...to express myself...

58:00.944 --> 58:03.936
...when I am on the verge...

58:06.516 --> 58:09.781
...of exploding in my pants.

58:13.156 --> 58:16.250
You are too cute.

58:16.993 --> 58:18.426
Get the fuck out of here.

58:21.164 --> 58:23.155
- I'm Kendra.
- I'm Dave.

58:23.433 --> 58:24.627
Let me buy you a drink.

58:26.102 --> 58:27.967
Can I get a cosmopolitan?

58:36.646 --> 58:38.341
I couldn't take it anymore...

58:38.548 --> 58:41.847
...so finally I just tell my boss:

58:42.085 --> 58:46.112
"Hey, baldy, if I want crap out of you,
I'll squeeze your head."

58:46.623 --> 58:50.457
- I didn't say that, but I should have.
- You are so funny.

58:50.660 --> 58:53.629
Too bad you're leaving town.
We could have fun together.

58:54.998 --> 58:57.660
Unfortunately, I am leaving
in the morning.

58:57.834 --> 59:00.166
In fact, I think I gotta get back
to my friend.

59:08.478 --> 59:09.502
What's the matter?

59:10.813 --> 59:13.008
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What's wrong?

59:13.216 --> 59:15.081
My friend took off on me.

59:15.318 --> 59:17.149
I can give you a ride.

59:17.420 --> 59:19.251
I don't even know where the guy lives.

59:19.422 --> 59:22.448
We can hang out at my place until you
get in touch with him.

59:29.899 --> 59:32.561
I bet there's like 50 Rydells in here.

59:32.769 --> 59:35.135
I shouldn't eat this. I'm getting so fat.

59:35.438 --> 59:37.065
What? You're not fat.

59:37.240 --> 59:40.004
My clothes hide it, but I'm
getting gooey right here.

59:40.276 --> 59:41.709
I don't see any goo.

59:41.945 --> 59:44.436
You want to see goo,
I'll show you my ass.

59:44.781 --> 59:47.682
Well, I see it,
and I didn't five years ago.

59:47.850 --> 59:50.717
I went out with this guy,
and he wouldn't sleep with me.

59:50.887 --> 59:54.880
And I asked him why, and he said that
when he saw me without my clothes...

59:55.792 --> 59:57.487
...that I look like a porker.

59:57.660 --> 01:00:01.289
He was probably just nervous
because you're beautiful and....

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:04.657
Anyways, you're not a porker.
You're the un-porker.

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.699
You're Sizzlean.

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:13.031
- You're so sweet, Dave.
- Well, you're sweet, Kendra.

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:17.269
Thanks for having me here.
He said her name was Rose.

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:18.946
Rose.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:23.283
Rose Rydell. Rose Rydell.
Rose Rydell.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.648
Rose Rydell! I got it!

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.282
Kendra...

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:35.558
...even though I'd love to see you
take that bra off...

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:40.098
...because it represents a team
I've hated my entire life...

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.562
...I think you gotta keep it on.

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:43.831
Why?

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:47.141
Because I got a girlfriend.

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.906
I'm not a child, Dave.

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:55.448
If you think I'm a porker, then just
come right out and say it.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.347
No. I don't think you're a porker.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.318
Then why when the idea of sleeping
with me comes up...

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.788
...do you all of a sudden
have a "girlfriend"?

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:05.519
Because I do. I do. I have a girlfriend.

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:07.595
Said the liar to the beached whale!

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:09.197
You're not a beached whale.

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:11.731
If anything, you could even
gain a few pounds.

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:15.235
So now I'm too skinny for you?

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.802
No. I didn't mean that.

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:19.998
- Is this what you want, Dave?
- No.

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:21.801
If I put on a few pounds...

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:25.778
...will you be able to stifle your vomit
long enough to have sex with me?!

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:27.480
Holy shit.

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:31.050
Are you such a hot stud
that you'll break me in two?!

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.451
You're angry right now. Wanna sing?
Do you know "I Feel Pretty"?

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:37.956
- Get out! Get out!
- Stop!

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:39.320
Get out!

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.292
Get out!!

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.196
Porker!

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:44.388
Fatty!

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:47.225
No!!

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:01.742
How did it go, pal?

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:05.011
- Why'd you ditch me?
- What are you talking about?

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:06.746
You gave me the signal.

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:09.048
I didn't give you the signal to leave.

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:12.820
I gave you the signal to say your
gross pickup line actually worked.

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:14.929
Well, of course it did.

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:18.767
So did Little Davey need
some anger management?

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.301
- That chick was killer.
- Serial killer.

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.939
She tried to chocolate me to death.

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:26.166
Anyways, I don't cheat on Linda.

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.646
- Speaking of Linda, she called earlier.
- Oh, yeah?

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:34.212
She seemed a little bit
bent out of shape.

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:37.750
- About what?
- Your being out with another woman.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.980
- How would she know that?
- I told her.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:43.489
- What else could I do?
- What else could you do?

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:48.153
You could've told her something else.
I was at the bank. I was at the store.

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:51.266
I ate bad guacamole
and I couldn't stop shitting!

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.265
Any of those would have been fine!

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:56.500
Well, I'm sorry, Dave, but I don't lie
for my patients.

01:02:56.672 --> 01:03:00.199
You want to leave your friend and
run off and chase some hot babe...

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:02.444
...you can't expect me to cover for you.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:05.274
I did what you told me to do,
you sick, demented man.

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:10.408
What are you laughing at?

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:12.977
What's so funny?

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:19.424
Kendra is an ex-patient of mine,
an actress. Pretty good one too.

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:24.089
I arranged for her to be in the bar
and for you to pick her up.

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.199
You were messing with me?

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:32.102
Yeah. You know, just a joke
between friends...

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:35.642
...like the one you pulled on me
about my dying mother.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.110
I told you I'd get you back for that.

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:40.304
All right.

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:46.048
So you really didn't talk to Linda.

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:49.823
Of course I did.
That's what made it so funny.

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:54.025
Where's your phone?

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:58.495
She's not home, Dave.
She went out with her pal Andrea.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:01.269
She doesn't know any Andreas.
You mean Andrew?

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:06.134
Yeah, that's it.
Andrew, the testicle with legs.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.866
"The testicle with legs." Great!!

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:12.674
Now wait a minute. Calm down a bit.
Try some deep breathing.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.784
Maybe just hum a little "I Feel Pretty."

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:19.510
No!! How about you hum
the "I'm a Crazy Asshole" song?

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.419
And take me home, you
psychotic piece of wacko.

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.817
I never thought you'd take it like this.

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:40.367
So, what, we're not going to talk at all?

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:47.141
Would you forgive me if I told you
I called Linda last night...

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:50.977
...after our little fracas
and explained that it was my fault?

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:52.343
What did she say?

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:57.855
Well, she's not mad at you anymore,
but she let me have it pretty good.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.153
You deserved it. I did nothing wrong.

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.990
I know. I know.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:04.822
Friends?

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:10.564
- Take a little nap.
- I am tired.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.571
Well, you had a rough night.

01:05:26.355 --> 01:05:27.913
Stop with the cupcake!

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:32.361
Rise and shine, Sir Snoozola.

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.163
What's going on? Where are we?

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:38.129
Well, at a great deal of expense
and effort...

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:41.896
...we have managed to locate
your grade school bête noire...

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:43.060
...Arnie Shankman.

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:46.436
We do desire a confrontation with him,
do we not?

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:50.440
What? Do you mean the kid
who bullied me in fifth grade?

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:54.606
Dave, I think it's pivotal for you
to confront your childhood nemesis.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:58.478
Remember, for 22 more days,
you are mine.

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.086
This is where Arnie Shankman lives?

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:09.389
You're kidding me. You're going to
make me confront a monk.

01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:11.893
Great.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:20.640
Are you ashamed that you
never stood up to him?

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.641
No. He was just a kid lashing out...

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:25.337
...because his sister got sent
to an insane asylum.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:28.074
I'm surprised your research
didn't tell you that.

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:30.584
This doesn't look like him.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.749
Excuse me, Arnie Shankman?

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.655
Sorry about waking you up.

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:42.829
My name is Pana Kamanana...

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:46.460
...but, yes, I was once known
as Arnie Shankman.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:47.996
Arnie....

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.661
Pana Kamanana...

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:53.302
...Dave Buznik
from elementary school.

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.711
David Buznik.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.982
This is the last place I thought
I'd find you, a monastery.

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:03.744
You could say I've gone through
a rather dramatic transformation.

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:06.149
Could you excuse him for a second,
Peanuts?

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.420
His name's not Peanuts.
It's Pana Manapia.

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:14.029
You want me to fight a monk?
He's not even allowed to hurt a plant.

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:17.632
For Pete's sake, this is the monk
that twisted your tits!

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.234
Confront him or you're going to prison!

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:22.994
All right. All right. All right.

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:31.774
Anyways, what I wanted to say to you
was...

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:36.312
...when we were kids, you kind of
bullied me around a little bit...

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:40.888
...and I never really did anything
to deserve that kind of treatment.

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:43.591
Of course not. I was a real cretin then.

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:46.226
I did a lot of horrible things as a kid.

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:49.660
I pushed you around.
I called you nasty names.

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:52.662
You pulled my gym shorts down
in front of Sara Plowman.

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:56.830
That actually was pretty funny.

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:59.500
Jeez, I don't think that it was.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.939
Now, come, David.
Humor is the spice of life.

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:05.147
The look on your face was priceless.

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.206
"Oh! Sara saw my pee-pee!"

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:11.913
So Pena likes the spicy humor.

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:16.113
Maybe he'd enjoy the knee-slapper
you told me about the great Buddha.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:17.850
What did you say about Buddha?

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:21.656
Dave said, "How does a guy
who weighs over 600 pounds...

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:24.959
...have the balls to teach people
about self-discipline?"

01:08:26.135 --> 01:08:27.966
Let's not make fun of my God, here.

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:31.698
You know what else Dave finds
particularly piquant?

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:35.502
Recalling your nut-job sister
struggling with her underpants...

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:36.736
...in a straitjacket.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.243
You think that's funny?

01:08:38.413 --> 01:08:40.506
Dave used to con her
into getting naked...

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:43.447
...by saying that her clothes
had ghosts in them.

01:08:43.618 --> 01:08:44.846
That never happened.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.113
Then he'd pull out his winkie
and tell her...

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:49.951
...it was a strawberry ice-cream cone.

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:53.756
Is that what you've come here
to tell me?

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:56.796
Did you expose yourself...

01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.292
...to my sister?

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:04.603
- And don't shove me again.
- It's shower-room humiliation again.

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:08.265
He's giving you a wet willie and
making you chew on his jockstrap...

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:10.377
...and fart blossom and all this.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:15.517
Answer me, Buznik!
Did you get it on with my sister?

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:19.277
Over and over again.

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:23.625
And she moaned like a wildebeest.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.760
Wildebeest.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:30.932
Whoo! Now, that felt good!

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.193
I wasn't expecting that
from a Buddhist.

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:37.995
- I'm a little pissed off right now.
- You all right? You're all right.

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:45.572
David! David! No, David!

01:09:45.747 --> 01:09:47.375
Easy, boy!

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.915
Sorry.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.179
Help me, brother.

01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:53.947
- Help me.
- Okay. Come on. Come on.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:56.918
Okay, we're even. We're even now.

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:59.718
- I went crazy. I'm so sorry.
- I started it.

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:01.419
- I started it.
- It's all right.

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:03.360
And I'm gonna finish it!

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:06.601
Now we're even, butt-lick!

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:08.960
No! Don't! Don't! Don't!

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:12.869
"What's that, Auntie Em?
It's a twister!"

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:14.666
My nipples!

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:17.471
Pena! Look! Your sister's back.

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:20.046
I got Casper in my clothes!

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.550
- Pretty good.
- Thanks, baby.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.709
I'll kill you!

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.589
You want that rake?

01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:31.385
You can't get that rake from me!

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.027
Look, everybody!

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:35.163
Pana Banana's got a heinie.

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.661
- He's got a heinie!
- I give!

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:39.528
- I give!
- All right. I'm sorry.

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:43.166
- Friends?
- You suck!

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:47.231
Shankman!

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:49.900
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

01:10:50.112 --> 01:10:52.205
- I've seen enough.
- Hold it right there.

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:54.611
This party's by invitation only.

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:00.784
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:09.153
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.397
Hold it back there! Come on, come on.

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:18.631
Start the car!

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:20.900
Go! Go! Go! Come on, let's go!

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:23.169
Now! Now! Now! Now!

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:31.312
Oh, boy!

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.318
We were like Butch and Sundance!

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:36.947
Oh, my God! I thought you
were going to shoot somebody!

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:44.090
You really threw me some curves
back there, kid.

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:46.996
I never expected it to go that way.

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:50.166
But you kicked some serious
monk ass there, baby.

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.034
You're damn right, baby!

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:55.766
- How did it feel?
- I feel good! I feel incredible!

01:11:56.011 --> 01:12:00.107
I feel bad about molesting his sister
all those times, but it's all right!

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:04.885
- You really molested a crazy girl?
- No. Got you.

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:10.623
Congratulations, keed,
you've reached level three

01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:17.528
I would never have done anything
with that girl.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:22.228
Don't worry. Dr. Rydell explained
everything to me, and I get it.

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:27.467
Dr. Rydell brought up an interesting
fact about me being a procrastinator.

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:30.874
...and I was going to wait
for a Yankee game to do this.

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:32.240
...but....

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:36.474
I don't know. I.... It's something
I wanted to say to you...

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:40.416
...and I'm having a hard time saying it
for some reason. But....

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:46.819
It's just that monks, they talk shit...

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.792
...but they can't back it up.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.469
That's what was so hard to say to me?

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:04.512
You know, when I was on the phone
with Buddy, he gave me some advice.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:08.616
That's great.
His advice is a little cuckoo...

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.751
...but somehow it works.

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:14.082
Well, then I guess I'll just do
what he suggested.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.729
I don't think that we should
see each other for a while.

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:25.795
Buddy thinks that a trial separation
will ultimately...

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:29.030
...strengthen our relationship.

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:37.171
Now, Fury Fighters...

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:40.577
...what keys do we need to possess
before we can...?

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.114
Dave. You're late.

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:45.219
- Can I talk to you alone, please?
- Sure you can...

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:57.227
You told Linda we should have
a trial separation?

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:58.730
- Yes.
- Yes?!

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.093
Yes!

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:03.998
Separating from Linda
is a crucial part of our strategy.

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:06.403
My strategy is to keep my girlfriend.

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:09.838
All right. Strictly as a friend.

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:13.075
Linda's been thinking about
leaving you for some time.

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:16.915
She loves you, but she
recognizes you're a neurotic mess.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:18.175
You're jealous...

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:22.551
...self-loathing, resentful, insecure
and a premature ejaculator.

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:25.155
She told you I was
a premature ejaculator?

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.692
That part I was assuming.

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.627
I haven't done that in,
like, eight months.

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:35.259
Anyway, a trial separation will make
you both gain a deeper appreciation...

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:37.597
...for David Buznik.

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:42.269
After she dates a couple of losers,
she'll be begging you to take her back.

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:51.552
So I've been thinking about it,
Linda...

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:56.348
...and a trial separation is exactly
what we need.

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:59.618
And if you want to start seeing...

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:02.558
...other penises... People...

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.095
...I want you to feel free.

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:09.270
You sound upset. Are you all right?

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:16.442
I'm fine. Just date anybody you'd like.

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:18.545
And don't hold back, okay?

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:22.944
Because there's a lot of nice guys
out there and I'm cool with it.

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:24.709
I'll be strong.

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:31.184
So the guy asked me for change.
I laughed. He cursed.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.418
I whizzed on him.

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:36.258
- What else could I do, huh?
- You should've tossed a rock at him.

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:39.729
That's your solution for everything.
The guy's homeless, right?

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:41.731
Let him be. Set your anger free.

01:15:42.237 --> 01:15:46.139
Look at you, Lou. You've really calmed
down since working with Dr. B.

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:48.242
- We all have.
- Hey, fellas.

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:50.903
Could you bring it down a little bit?

01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:53.912
We're trying to have dinner.
The walls are really thin.

01:15:54.082 --> 01:15:56.846
- This is a free country!
- What's going on with you?!

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.280
- Are you crazy?!
- Go in! Just go in.

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:03.291
Goosfraba! Goosfraba!

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:06.518
Goosfraba.

01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:09.320
Very good.
What are you guys doing here?

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:11.829
I need to see Dr. B. I'm in crisis.

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:14.662
He's not here.
Why don't you go look for him?

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:19.296
Davey, your girlfriend stopped by
and she dropped these off for you.

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:22.942
Those are her keys to my apartment.

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:25.341
I think your girlfriend's cheating
on you.

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:28.343
- Why?
- I heard her on her cell phone...

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:30.212
...talking to a guy...

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:33.984
- ...making a date.
- I'm so sorry, Dave.

01:16:34.389 --> 01:16:35.822
Andrew.

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:37.252
I'll kill that guy.

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:42.160
She ain't cheating on me by the way.
We agreed to take a break.

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:45.823
She's not taking a break
from the old sausage, huh?

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:47.390
Sorry.

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:50.433
She's meeting the Andrew at Mort's
on 86th Street now...

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:51.868
...if you want to go watch.

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:56.207
No. No, I can't do that.

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:02.839
We're here.

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:06.615
- Both of you showed up?
- You like Stacy better or something?

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:10.952
It's just that I want to go on a fake
date to get my girlfriend jealous...

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:13.287
...so I really only needed
one of you guys.

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:15.462
Well, now she'll be twice as jealous.

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:18.791
- So do you know the guy she's with?
- I think I might.

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.264
Let me ask you something.

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:24.633
Because of your profession
you probably have seen a lot of them.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:29.140
Does size count at all, or is that just
some weird thing guys think about?

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:32.178
This is where Gina and I
always get into a heated debate.

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:34.178
I like them when they're really big.

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:37.045
And I think it's better
when they're enormous.

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:45.525
Good evening.

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:47.821
Table for three?

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:50.863
- May we take your coats?
- No. We're okay.

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:53.365
The girls are gonna
take their coats off.

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:55.696
Would you like a boobs... ? Booth?

01:17:59.307 --> 01:18:03.505
Actually, could you give us a table
overlooking that table right there?

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.647
- Sure. Right this way.
- Thank you.

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:12.410
Oh, my God. It's Stacy and Gina.

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:13.986
Who?

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:15.680
Nobody.

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:18.121
I'm so hungry I could eat you, Dave.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.950
Yummy. Yummy.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:23.788
- Let's get wasted tonight.
- Definitely.

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:27.128
Have fun.
Lucky son of a bitch.

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:31.237
What?

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:34.936
I can't believe this.

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.441
Excuse me.

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:41.275
Linda. I'm a little embarrassed. I
didn't know you were going to be here.

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:43.917
I guess not. Are those your friends?

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:47.852
I'm supposed to date other people
so I figured I'd give it a try.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:55.852
Gina, can you stop sucking
on Stacy's finger for one second?

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:58.192
I want to introduce you to somebody.

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:02.100
- Stacy, Gina, this is Linda.
- Nice to meet you.

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:05.032
And I'd like you to meet my date.

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:08.371
Ladies, this is Buddy Rydell.

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:11.640
- Look, Dave, it's Buddy.
- I see.

01:19:11.813 --> 01:19:14.748
- You know Stacy and Gina?
- Yes, yes, I do.

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:17.646
We're in Dave's anger group.
Fury Fighters!

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:21.848
Well, gee whiz.
Here's your Rémy, Linda.

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:23.991
This is a bit awkward.

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:25.717
I mean, group members...

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:28.328
...are not supposed to get
romantically involved.

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:31.432
- Yeah! I agree with that.
- You know that.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.694
I'd like to talk to you alone
for a second.

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:38.601
There's a rage control technique I'd
like to go over with you right now.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.435
Of course. Excuse me...

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.001
What?

01:19:45.013 --> 01:19:47.447
- Two of the usual, Duke.
- Coming right up, Dr. B.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:50.483
You're the biggest backstabbing
piece of crap I ever met.

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.613
What are you saying?

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:55.018
I'm trying to give you a hand.
It's my job.

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.818
Bullshit!
Your job is to steal my girlfriend?!

01:19:58.026 --> 01:20:00.358
My job is trying to prevent
Mr. Andrew...

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:03.464
...from unleashing the Whopper
with Cheese.

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.661
That's right. Since you've
been out of the picture...

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:09.531
...Andrew's been burning up the wires
night and day...

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:13.297
...trying to rekindle those
hotsie-totsie nights up at Brown U.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:16.342
- How would you know?
- You think I only tapped your phone?

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:18.012
What was she saying?

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:21.979
The good news is, I already launched
a preemptive strike.

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:24.983
Now the situation is contained.

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:27.144
You and I control the game.

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:28.378
How?

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:31.890
I will be uncharacteristically
aggressively boring.

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:35.996
I keep talking about myself,
acting arrogant and obnoxious.

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:39.164
When Linda sees what
the dating world is really like...

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:42.997
...then guess who comes out
smelling like a white mushroom?

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:50.344
- You swear to me this will work?
- The ball's already up in the air.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:53.512
Incidentally, nice move
bringing the girls.

01:20:54.182 --> 01:20:57.174
Very strong. Come on.

01:20:57.352 --> 01:21:00.048
I'll see you at home
in a half-hour, keed.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:05.091
That's 25 dollars, pal.

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:07.022
We don't....

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.960
Where were you? It's 1:00.

01:21:43.198 --> 01:21:47.328
When you hear what happened, you'll
bow down and worship me like a god.

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:49.629
- Better be good. Give it to me.
- Okay.

01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:52.864
After dinner, she insisted we go home.
So we hop on the bus...

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:55.601
The bus? You took the bus?
What happened to your car?

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.404
I was way too smashed to drive.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:02.812
I told her I didn't want to waste money
on a cab. That did not go down well.

01:22:03.885 --> 01:22:05.375
Okay. I like that.

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.714
So we get to her house...

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:11.219
...we have some kind of a weird
argument...

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:14.726
...about the number of syllables
in a haiku.

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:16.261
Poetry garbage.

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:19.830
She said it was getting late,
we kissed and I headed on home.

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:23.702
Now, you say you kissed?

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:26.567
It was nothing. Little five-second kiss.
That's all.

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.231
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:30.967
You're having this horrible evening.

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:34.582
- How do you end up kissing, again?
- I wish I knew, keed.

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:37.343
We were both pretty geezed up.

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:41.419
One second we're fighting,
and the next second we're laughing...

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:43.988
...and then just a quick
10-second kiss.

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:46.627
I thought that you said five seconds.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.456
First it was a five-second one...

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.997
...and then a little break because
my beard gave her a tickle.

01:22:52.334 --> 01:22:55.132
She's cute.
And then a 10-second Frencher.

01:22:56.271 --> 01:23:00.503
You had your crazy, corroded tongue
in my girlfriend's mouth?

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:05.043
Just a second. Just one second, Dave.

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:08.077
Dr. B, let it bip.

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:10.843
Well, hello.

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:15.018
I shouldn't really talk right now.

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:18.352
Well, I suppose you're right.

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:21.592
It's got to be done.

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:24.426
Who was that? Linda?

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:32.699
I've got some good news for you
and some potentially upsetting news.

01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:34.705
First, the good news.

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:37.538
I'm going to sign your papers.
You're a free man.

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:39.942
Let me hear
the potentially upsetting news.

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:44.608
Linda and I have fallen
for one another.

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:46.219
Pretty hard too.

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:49.614
David, I hope you believe me
when I say this:

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:51.622
I didn't intend for this to happen.

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:54.557
It was no one's fault, I guess.
It was just...

01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:56.287
Wait a minute.

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:02.336
I figured this out.

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:10.743
You're messing with me.

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:13.141
I wish I were, Dave.

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:18.483
However, I did insist that we not
go forward without your blessing...

01:24:18.653 --> 01:24:23.590
...because we're best friends.
So, what do you say, Dave?

01:24:24.159 --> 01:24:26.992
Is it all right if I date your ex?

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:32.991
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:35.830
I am appalled by your assault
on Dr. Rydell.

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:39.405
Obviously, anger management
has been a complete failure for you.

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:43.533
I'm setting a trial date for 3 weeks
from today for attempted murder.

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:47.477
As for Dr. Rydell's safety,
I'm issuing a restraining order.

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:50.982
Which means that at no time can you
come within 500 feet of him...

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:53.518
...or his lovely new girlfriend, Linda.

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:55.417
Court is adjourned.

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:16.171
Coming, Peaches.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:26.481
Are you kidding me?

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.286
Numb-nuts, where's the catalog
for my Fat Cat clothing line?

01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:36.930
I said I'd have it by 3.

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:40.763
- Okay.
- Get in gear.

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:45.838
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:48.669
I hope you have it.
My presentation's in two hours.

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:51.937
What's this? Your fat-shit cat's
been sitting there all day.

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:53.646
Don't worry about him.

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:56.716
Here you go.
I think you're gonna like it.

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:05.183
It's good stuff.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.928
That's a good picture, I think.

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.095
What the hell is this?!

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:14.326
You keep telling everybody you
created the Husky Cat line.

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:17.003
I thought you'd want your picture
in there. No?

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:19.470
Question: Can I get two couches
in my office?

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:22.269
If friends come over, I want them
to feel comfortable.

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:23.501
What office?

01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:28.047
Frank was nice enough to give me
some creative executive position.

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:32.920
- You gave him the job that I wanted?
- He earned it.

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:35.555
Why can't you be happy for me?
Linda's gonna be.

01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:38.587
Know something?
I'm sick of you hanging out with Linda.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.251
She dumped you 15 years ago.
Get over it.

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:42.828
I wouldn't worry about me.

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:46.194
It's your pal Buddy who's taking her
to the Yankee game tonight.

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.401
Yankee game.

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:51.832
Did he steal my proposal idea?

01:26:52.507 --> 01:26:55.135
Buznik, your behavior is unacceptable.

01:26:56.344 --> 01:26:58.175
Unacceptable?

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:03.840
I've been getting your coffee and
doing your work for five years now.

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:06.145
When a good position
actually opens up...

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:08.787
...you give it to the biggest dick
in the world?

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:12.893
I don't know about the world, but it's
definitely the biggest one in the room.

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:16.924
Now, when I started here...

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:20.100
...I was promised advancement
opportunities.

01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:23.429
And breaking that promise, to me,
is unacceptable.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.334
You see? I golf also.
You should bring me sometime.

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:32.808
So when I get out of jail, sometime
in the next two to five years...

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:37.748
...I expect you to give me the position
that Andrew just resigned from.

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:40.717
- Okay.
- Great.

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:43.049
Have fun looking like Colonel Klink.

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:49.254
By the way, his name is not
Fat-shit Cat, it's Meatball...

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:52.092
...and he's eating your crab cakes
right now.

01:27:58.039 --> 01:28:01.941
- You starting to get excited?
- Are you kidding? I'm out of my mind.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.771
This is going to be some night.

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:08.343
Come on. Come on.

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:21.389
- Dr. B, how's it going?
- Very well, thank you.

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:24.056
Always a thrill. Right this way.

01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:29.362
Where the hell's a spot?
Where's a spot?

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:31.764
Whoa! Watch it, man!

01:28:31.939 --> 01:28:32.106
Your attention, please.

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:33.539
Your attention, please.

01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:35.539
Before tonight's National Anthem...

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:38.770
...Metropolitan Opera star Robert
Merrill...

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:43.713
...will present a special moment
for two special people.

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:45.942
I love when they do this.

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:50.651
- Good.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Merrill.

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:07.698
Linda?! Linda!

01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:28.794
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:31.221
Wait, don't I know you?

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:33.333
- Come on.
- Where's your German accent?

01:29:38.072 --> 01:29:39.937
You have me confused with somebody...

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:42.770
I wanna get on the field.
I'm a fan of Mr. Merrill's.

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:45.572
- There's no fans allowed on that field.
- Galaxia.

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:47.636
It's Gary.

01:29:47.815 --> 01:29:51.478
Whatever. Someone else will marry
my woman if you don't let me go.

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:56.081
- Hebrew Melvin's in love.
- Very much.

01:29:57.658 --> 01:29:59.751
I can't stop love.

01:29:59.994 --> 01:30:01.757
- Go.
- Thank you.

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:06.529
Don't think I don't owe you
a couple smacks by the way.

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:11.469
Good evening. Tonight, romance
comes to Yankee Stadium.

01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:16.040
Oh, my God, it's Dave.

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:18.341
What the heck are you doing here?

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:21.013
- I wanna borrow this for a second.
- That's my mike!

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:22.672
Linda? Where are you?

01:30:23.384 --> 01:30:24.681
Don't move.

01:30:25.119 --> 01:30:27.610
Linda? Are you out there, honey?

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:31.215
Linda, I'm not mad at you.

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:35.622
Oh, shit.

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:40.224
I know that crazy man
brought you here.

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:44.371
Davey's going crazy!

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:47.303
I've done crazier stuff than that
to win back a chick.

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:49.568
Once I ran naked
through a subway station.

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:51.143
How was that supposed to work?

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:54.046
I guess I never really
thought it through.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.214
I gotta tell you something personal!

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:00.979
This kid lost his marbles.

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.447
I'm over here!

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:09.394
Linda, think about
what you're doing to us.

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:13.558
Sweet tackle. Wow!

01:31:13.734 --> 01:31:15.668
Dave just got leveled!

01:31:16.737 --> 01:31:20.332
- Nobody messes with my microphone.
- I'm sorry.

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:21.939
Bob?

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:25.341
- Everything all right, Buddy?
- Oh, yeah.

01:31:25.513 --> 01:31:27.276
I've never seen you so excited.

01:31:27.448 --> 01:31:30.212
It's not every day a man
gets to propose marriage...

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:31.908
...to the woman he loves.

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:34.919
Now, here's what I want you to write
on the scoreboard.

01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:38.923
Linda! Linda, I've loved you
since the day I met you!

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:41.254
I won't let you do this to us!

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:44.562
Don't marry him!

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:46.366
Don't marry him!

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:49.499
Wait!

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:52.966
Let this man finish
what he came here to say.

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.103
Let the man back in.

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:58.541
- Who was that guy?
- I think it's Regis Philbin.

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:04.245
Thank you, Mayor Giuliani.
You're the man, by the way.

01:32:06.053 --> 01:32:08.988
This clown better hurry up.
My arm's starting to ice over.

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:11.647
Chill, Rocket. Goosfraba.

01:32:11.826 --> 01:32:13.191
Goosfraba.

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:15.929
Goosfraba.

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:22.600
I can understand why you wanted
to see other people. I really can.

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:25.461
Buddy Rydell is a psycho!

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:28.305
But he was right about one thing.

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:31.601
I was an angry guy.

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:34.307
Mainly angry at myself...

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:37.542
...for letting people treat me like crap
all the time.

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:40.476
But I don't want to be that angry guy
anymore.

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:42.054
I wanna change.

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:43.721
If you give me a chance...

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:47.725
...I can show you that I got the guts
to stand up for what I believe in.

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.487
And I believe in us, Linda.

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:53.928
I love you with all my heart,
and I know you love me back.

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:56.463
I should be your husband...

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:58.801
...not that weirdo.

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:05.109
I want to have a family with you.
I want to have kids with you.

01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:08.112
Kids who have your eyes...

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:09.681
...and your lips...

01:33:10.284 --> 01:33:11.615
...and my...

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:14.480
...last name.
That's all I wish on them.

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:19.091
Please marry me, Linda.

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:28.301
Before I make my decision,
you have to do something for me.

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:35.169
You have to kiss me
in front of all these people!

01:33:41.148 --> 01:33:43.048
You can do it, David!

01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:47.214
Give her a five-second Frencher!

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:53.389
Kiss her, David.

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:55.990
Kiss her, David.

01:33:57.898 --> 01:33:59.729
Kiss her, David!

01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:02.794
Kiss her, David.

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:12.437
Go Yankees!

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:31.992
Dave's a dirty boy.

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.760
That wasn't so bad, was it?

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:40.639
I can't believe you actually
started to fall for that crazy man.

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:43.174
Buddy's not such a bad guy.

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:51.779
Congratulations! You just graduated
from anger management!

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:17.035
I'm glad your car died.
The train's romantic.

01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:18.735
Don't change the subject.

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:23.782
You're telling me the past two weeks
of my life was just therapy?

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:25.212
Well....

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:26.608
Yeah.

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:29.081
I met with Buddy
after reading his book...

01:35:29.256 --> 01:35:32.623
...and I told him about some
of the things going on in your life...

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:37.787
...and how upset it was making you
and how nuts it was making me.

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:42.732
He said that he thought he could help,
but it would be tough.

01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:44.961
So how much of this thing was a setup?

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:49.506
Well, the guy in your seat on the
plane, the flight attendant, the judge...

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:51.668
...they're all friends of Buddy's.

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:55.213
What about the air marshal
who tasered me? Was he in on it?

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:57.213
No, he was just having a bad day.

01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:59.978
Son of a bitch.

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:13.929
Skipper, how you doing?

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:18.996
Buddy Rydell, you're a great man.

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:22.640
I was just doing my job.
I never doubted you for a minute.

01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:25.343
Except when Galaxia had ahold of you.

01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:29.580
Did you just call that guy
Buddy Rydell?

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:33.818
A guy named Buddy Rydell
left this card...

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.615
...on what's left of my Lexus!

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:38.384
Oh, yeah. For insurance purposes.

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:40.493
Your insurance was canceled!

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.661
Grenada!

01:36:45.499 --> 01:36:48.866
Don't point that gun at Buddy.
I'm the one who smashed your car up.

01:36:49.036 --> 01:36:50.162
- Dave?!
- No!

01:36:50.371 --> 01:36:51.963
I'm sick of guys like this.

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:54.471
You wanna mess with my friends,
shoot me first.

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:55.870
- Don't!
- Are you crazy?

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:57.370
Settle down.

01:36:57.545 --> 01:37:00.207
Butt out! Tough guy's
going to learn a lesson.

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:04.916
I'm not afraid. Dr. Rydell taught me
not to be afraid of anybody.

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:09.549
Can I ask you a question, though?

01:37:18.265 --> 01:37:19.892
Got you!

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:26.896
Dr. B, Davey just pulled a joke on us!

01:37:27.107 --> 01:37:29.439
And how does that make you feel, Lou?

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:43.454
Chuck.

01:37:43.624 --> 01:37:46.092
We were just doing a joke.
That's my friend.

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:47.692
Are you okay?

01:37:51.565 --> 01:37:54.033
He feels stunning.

01:37:55.305 --> 01:38:01.768
