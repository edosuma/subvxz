01:06.126 --> 01:08.504
Where have you been?
I've been waiting since 7:00.

01:08.504 --> 01:10.924
Get in. I had to find fireworks.

01:10.924 --> 01:12.210
Let me drive.

01:12.210 --> 01:14.504
Get in. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

01:17.462 --> 01:19.042
Are you coming or not?

01:39.966 --> 01:41.966
It's too crowded.

01:41.966 --> 01:43.798
I thought you were starving.

01:45.546 --> 01:47.756
Let's go someplace quiet.

01:49.252 --> 01:50.462
Okay.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.672
What are we doing?

02:05.336 --> 02:09.588
Sitting. Listening to music. Talking.

02:10.630 --> 02:14.462
-You seem weird. Is everything okay?
-Yeah, everything's fine.

02:22.336 --> 02:25.126
It's July.
How many shirts are you wearing?

02:25.126 --> 02:28.252
-I'm cold.
-You're cold on the Fourth of July?

02:32.714 --> 02:34.798
Fuck off and die!

02:41.126 --> 02:44.252
-What?
-"Fuck off and die"?

02:45.840 --> 02:47.084
Shut up.

03:12.462 --> 03:14.588
Was that car at the drive-in?

03:17.126 --> 03:19.252
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's.

03:25.672 --> 03:28.966
-Do you want me to tell him to leave?
-Stay in the car.

03:44.252 --> 03:46.378
-Was that your husband?
-No.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.462
Who was that, Darlene?

03:53.378 --> 03:55.588
Don't worry about it.

03:55.588 --> 03:59.042
-Don't tell me not to worry. Who was it?
-It's nothing.

04:18.714 --> 04:20.252
Oh, shit.

04:23.588 --> 04:24.840
Let's go.

04:28.378 --> 04:29.630
Now, D.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.420
Get your wallet.

04:51.966 --> 04:53.966
Man, you really creeped us out.

05:56.546 --> 05:59.336
<i>-Vallejo Police Department.</i>
<i>-I want to report a double murder.</i>

05:59.336 --> 06:01.042
<i>May I have your name</i>
<i>and where you are calling...</i>

06:01.042 --> 06:03.504
<i>If you go one mile east</i>
<i>on Columbus Parkway,</i>

06:03.504 --> 06:06.798
<i>a public park,</i>
<i>you'll find kids in a brown car.</i>

06:07.672 --> 06:10.504
<i>They were shot with a 9mm Luger.</i>

06:11.462 --> 06:13.672
<i>I also killed those kids last year.</i>

06:14.798 --> 06:16.882
<i>Goodbye.</i>

06:34.798 --> 06:35.924
Spit.

06:36.714 --> 06:38.588
Come on, buddy.

06:38.588 --> 06:41.672
-I swallowed it.
-Why?

06:41.672 --> 06:43.042
It was minty.

06:44.042 --> 06:46.546
You can't do that. It's not good for you.

06:47.420 --> 06:49.000
Lunch box.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.000
-Why am I not going on the bus?
-Because we're late.

06:53.924 --> 06:57.294
Okay, you're staying
with your mom and Aaron tonight.

06:57.924 --> 07:00.210
So, you don't like
having a new little brother?

07:00.210 --> 07:03.588
-No, not really.
-Oh, that's honest.

07:05.546 --> 07:07.420
Learn a lot.

07:10.756 --> 07:12.630
There will be a test tonight!

07:47.882 --> 07:49.000
Morning.

07:49.966 --> 07:52.000
-Hi.
-Good morning.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.378
-Morning.
-Morning.

08:14.546 --> 08:16.336
How's the coffee today, Shorty?

09:02.840 --> 09:04.462
Editorial in two.

09:34.420 --> 09:35.672
Good morning, gentlemen.

09:35.672 --> 09:37.000
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.042
Well, Stanton, tell Mr. Howe

09:39.042 --> 09:41.546
the draft board piece
was damn near perfect.

09:42.714 --> 09:44.210
Mr. Graysmith.

09:45.756 --> 09:47.252
Horrid.

09:47.252 --> 09:48.420
Horrid.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.714
Not so horrid.

09:50.714 --> 09:52.504
Horrid.
I'm thinking we go with not so horrid.

09:56.210 --> 09:58.966
Paul, what's on the crime beat?

09:58.966 --> 10:03.168
Janice in Datebook left the fondue party
before everyone got naked.

10:03.168 --> 10:05.000
That's a crime.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.210
Have you seen her? Wouldn't kid you.

10:07.210 --> 10:10.000
It may be the beginning of a crime wave.

10:10.504 --> 10:12.378
You need to see this.

10:17.756 --> 10:19.672
Go get the publisher.

10:19.672 --> 10:20.882
"Dear Editor,

10:20.882 --> 10:22.042
"This is the murderer

10:22.042 --> 10:24.210
"of the two teenagers
last Christmas at Lake Herman

10:24.210 --> 10:27.462
"and the girl on the Fourth of July
near the golf course in Vallejo.

10:27.462 --> 10:28.630
"To prove I killed them,

10:28.630 --> 10:32.462
"I shall state some facts
which only I and the police know.

10:32.462 --> 10:35.798
"Christmas,
brand name of ammo, Super-X.

10:36.672 --> 10:38.252
"Ten shots were fired.

10:38.252 --> 10:41.168
"The boy was on his back
with his feet to the car.

10:41.168 --> 10:42.420
"The girl..."

10:44.630 --> 10:47.672
Would you read that, please?

10:48.882 --> 10:51.504
"The girl was on her right side,
feet to the west.

10:51.504 --> 10:53.252
"Fourth of July.

10:53.252 --> 10:56.252
"One, girl was

10:56.252 --> 10:58.420
"The boy was also shot in the knee.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.756
"Brand name of ammo was Western.

11:01.462 --> 11:03.294
"Here is part of a cipher.

11:03.294 --> 11:06.924
"The other two parts of this cipher
are being mailed to the editors of

11:06.924 --> 11:09.840
<i>"the Vallejo Times and S.F. Examiner.</i>

11:09.840 --> 11:13.756
"I want you to print this cipher

11:13.756 --> 11:16.252
"In this cipher is my identity.

11:16.252 --> 11:18.882
"If you do not print this cipher
by the afternoon of Fry,"

11:18.882 --> 11:24.966
F-R-Y, "First of Aug '69
I will go on a kill rampage Fry night.

11:24.966 --> 11:29.378
"I will cruise around all weekend

"then move on to kill again

11:30.924 --> 11:34.756
"until I end up with
a dozen people over the weekend."

11:34.756 --> 11:37.252
It's unsigned except for a symbol.

11:38.462 --> 11:41.630
Is it me,
or does that look like a gunsight?

11:43.168 --> 11:45.126
Today's August first.

11:45.126 --> 11:46.840
He wants his code
in the afternoon edition.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.672
If the Examiner doesn't have
the balls to run it, we scoop the Bay.

11:49.714 --> 11:51.840
Al, this man is talking about
shooting 12 people.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.714
And not running this
might make him do that.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.294
If we run it, we might be setting
a very dangerous precedent.

11:56.294 --> 11:57.840
Oh, come on, now, it's newsworthy.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.168
Well, giving some sick bastard
a soapbox,

12:00.168 --> 12:01.294
what does that say to people?

12:01.294 --> 12:04.588
Back up. Is this Vallejo story true?
Do we know that?

12:04.588 --> 12:07.588
-Paul?
-What? I cover crime in Vallejo?

12:08.798 --> 12:10.798
Yeah, I cover crime in Vallejo.
Ten minutes.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.210
Let's shoot the code and call SFPD.

12:13.210 --> 12:17.042
If it turns out to be real,
at least we'll have the material.

12:17.504 --> 12:18.840
All right.

12:19.630 --> 12:22.000
Graysmith,
don't you have that cartoon to finish?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.252
Oh, yeah.

12:29.756 --> 12:32.084
Hi, this is Paul Avery
<i>from the San Francisco Chronicle.</i>

12:32.084 --> 12:35.252
I'm looking for someone to
shed some light on a letter we received.

12:35.252 --> 12:36.294
Thank you.

12:37.546 --> 12:38.672
Sergeant Mulanax.

12:38.672 --> 12:40.546
<i>Sergeant, Paul Avery from</i>
the San Francisco Chronicle.

12:40.546 --> 12:41.672
I just wanted to check

12:41.672 --> 12:43.588
if you had an unsolved
firearm-related homicide

12:43.588 --> 12:46.588
on Christmas and
maybe one on July fourth.

12:46.588 --> 12:47.798
Shit.

12:48.294 --> 12:49.672
You guys got one, too?

12:50.714 --> 12:54.000
Confirmed.
VPD, they confirmed the shootings.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.168
Al's on the phone with the Examiner

12:55.168 --> 12:56.672
They got the same letter
with a different code.

12:56.672 --> 12:57.840
<i>So did Times-Herald.</i>

12:57.840 --> 13:00.294
Christmas, two teenagers
on lover's lane. Both DOA.

13:00.294 --> 13:02.000
David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.672
July fourth,
Darlene Ferrin and Michael...

13:04.672 --> 13:06.630
I think it's "Mayhew."
Anyway, he lived, she didn't.

13:06.630 --> 13:07.798
The murder weapons?

13:07.798 --> 13:10.798
Ballistics, everything he said
in the letters matched.

13:10.798 --> 13:13.966
I mean, I think the Times-Herald's
gonna go with it.

13:13.966 --> 13:16.966
<i>The Examiner's going,</i>
but won't go front page.

13:16.966 --> 13:21.168
I say let's go front page.
If he kills 12 people, it's not our fault.

13:21.714 --> 13:24.294
Robert! We need the cartoon.

13:26.168 --> 13:29.462
-You're not finished?
-No, I'm finished, Carol. I'm finished.

13:29.462 --> 13:31.252
Thieriot's still here.

13:31.252 --> 13:32.462
Really?

13:32.882 --> 13:36.210
The first edition
is off the floor in 10 , Charles.

13:39.630 --> 13:41.126
Give us a sec.

13:44.042 --> 13:45.546
Okay, re-plate.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.588
We'll go on page... Page four.

13:50.420 --> 13:53.630
What do you say, 20 bucks
whoever cracks the psycho's name?

13:53.630 --> 13:55.546
He won't give his name.

13:56.798 --> 13:58.630
Morti's? Anyone?

13:58.630 --> 14:00.882
-That's where I'm heading.
-All right.

14:27.462 --> 14:30.252
Put those on my desk. Turn on the light.

14:41.210 --> 14:42.756
Grab your book.

14:45.714 --> 14:47.798
Now go get your jammies on.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.210
<i>All right, people, listen up.</i>

14:52.588 --> 14:57.756
The cipher's broken into three sections,
each with eight lines and 17 symbols.

14:57.756 --> 15:00.378
No breaks between the symbols
denoting different words.

15:00.378 --> 15:02.840
No numbers or clues
to substitution keys.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.966
And you got symbols
from at least seven different sources.

15:06.252 --> 15:10.924
Greek, Morse code, Navy semaphore,
weather symbols, astrological signs.

15:16.714 --> 15:19.924
-Hey, take a gander at this code thing.
-Okay.

15:25.210 --> 15:26.840
You wanna give it a go?

15:28.882 --> 15:31.966
Guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist. Bob Bastian.

15:31.966 --> 15:35.294
Now he's doing public television.
For some reason.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.210
Paul Avery.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.630
Robert Graysmith.
I've been here nine months.

15:45.672 --> 15:48.042
You were right, by the way.
He didn't give his name.

15:48.042 --> 15:49.084
Who cracked it?

15:49.084 --> 15:51.420
A history teacher
and his wife in Salinas.

15:51.420 --> 15:54.630
"I like killing people
because it is so much fun.

15:54.630 --> 15:58.756
"It is more fun
than killing wild game in the forest

15:58.756 --> 16:03.420
"because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.168
"Something gives me
the most thrilling experience.

16:06.168 --> 16:10.252
"It is even better
than getting your rocks off with a girl.

16:10.252 --> 16:14.000
"The best part of it is that when I die,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.042
"I will be reborn in paradise.

16:17.042 --> 16:20.546
"And all that I have killed
will become my slaves.

16:20.546 --> 16:24.378
"I will not give you my name
because you will try to slow down

16:24.420 --> 16:27.714
"or stop my collecting of slaves
for my afterlife."

16:27.714 --> 16:29.672
Methinks our friend's
a tad bit fuckered in the head.

16:29.672 --> 16:33.966
I heard he even sent Vallejo
a code key, just to help.

16:33.966 --> 16:36.420
-What is that at the bottom?
-Leftovers.

16:36.420 --> 16:38.042
Maybe an anagram.

16:54.504 --> 16:56.966
How does one do that?

16:57.756 --> 16:59.966
I like puzzles. I do them a lot.

17:01.294 --> 17:04.378
How did you know
he wasn't gonna give his name?

17:04.924 --> 17:06.588
Dangerous animal.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.042
Dangerous animal.

17:09.966 --> 17:12.840
What dangerous animal?
How do I know that?

17:20.168 --> 17:21.882
-Paul.
-Yes, Templeton.

17:21.882 --> 17:24.000
-Editorial, now.
-Very well.

17:26.126 --> 17:27.798
Another letter.

17:27.798 --> 17:31.126
More of the same.
Details about the murders.

17:32.252 --> 17:36.252
He taped a flashlight to the gun.
That's how he hit them in the dark.

17:36.252 --> 17:38.336
And he gave himself a name.

17:59.462 --> 18:02.672
You know this used to be
the town of Montecello?

18:02.672 --> 18:04.084
But at some point,

18:04.084 --> 18:07.378
the county decided that the land
would work better as a lake.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.084
So they flooded it.

18:10.546 --> 18:14.420
-But there's an entire...
-Hidden city under the water.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.630
We were here last spring, remember?

18:16.630 --> 18:18.042
Oh, yeah.

18:24.210 --> 18:26.042
Somebody else is here.

18:26.042 --> 18:27.840
It is a public park.

18:30.462 --> 18:32.672
I think he's watching us.

18:32.672 --> 18:34.924
Well, we're very good-looking.

18:40.588 --> 18:42.042
Where'd he go?

18:44.756 --> 18:46.546
He went behind that tree.

18:46.546 --> 18:48.966
All right. So he's taking a leak.

18:55.924 --> 18:57.840
He's coming towards us.

18:59.882 --> 19:01.882
Oh, my God, he has a gun.

19:02.672 --> 19:04.210
Don't move.

19:04.210 --> 19:07.126
-I want your money and your car keys.
-Okay.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.504
We're not gonna do anything, okay?

19:09.504 --> 19:13.210
We're gonna cooperate.
Just tell me what you want us to do.

19:16.882 --> 19:17.966
Here.

19:20.294 --> 19:22.840
You're welcome to everything I have.

19:26.378 --> 19:28.924
If there's anything else
I could do for you...

19:28.924 --> 19:31.252
Maybe I could write you a check?

19:33.798 --> 19:36.420
Okay, I could give you
my phone number.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.798
You know, I might be able to help you.

19:39.798 --> 19:42.000
Even more than you might think.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.084
He's a sociology major.

19:45.588 --> 19:48.210
Pre-law, actually.

19:50.336 --> 19:51.924
Oh, keys.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.126
You know, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly
where I put my keys.

19:54.126 --> 19:57.126
They might be on the blanket.
Is it okay if...

20:01.882 --> 20:03.462
Here's the keys.

20:04.924 --> 20:06.840
Don't get up.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.882
I want her to tie you up.

20:13.042 --> 20:14.168
Okay.

20:33.882 --> 20:37.000
You know, if he comes any closer,
I might be able to get that gun.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.336
-Don't get any ideas.
-I'm not.

20:39.336 --> 20:42.000
I killed a guard
escaping from prison in Montana.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.084
I'm not doing anything, okay?

20:44.084 --> 20:46.294
I'm not afraid to kill again.

20:47.798 --> 20:49.126
Look away.

20:56.378 --> 20:58.756
What was the name of that prison?

21:02.546 --> 21:05.126
Hey, you said it was in Montatana, right?

21:06.252 --> 21:08.000
I'm taking your car.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I'm going to Mexico.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.168
We didn't complain
when you tied our hands.

21:12.168 --> 21:14.252
Okay, you have everything that I have.

21:14.252 --> 21:17.168
We have done everything
that you've asked.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.630
It's okay. It's okay.

21:18.630 --> 21:20.924
She tied you loose, didn't she?

21:24.084 --> 21:26.252
Get on your stomach
so I can tie your feet.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.798
Okay.
It gets really cold out here at night.

21:28.798 --> 21:30.378
We could freeze.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.504
Okay, you all done?

21:42.504 --> 21:44.336
You know,
just because people are gonna ask,

21:44.336 --> 21:46.420
was that thing even loaded?

21:57.378 --> 21:58.714
It's okay.

21:59.420 --> 22:01.462
This is all gonna be okay.

22:30.420 --> 22:34.168
<i>Dispatch, this is 43L2,</i>
<i>heading south on Knoxville Road.</i>

22:34.168 --> 22:37.924
<i>I’ve got an abandoned white</i>
<i>VW Karmann-Ghia...</i>

22:51.966 --> 22:53.840
<i>Napa Police Department.</i>

22:53.840 --> 22:58.126
<i>I want to report a murder.</i>
<i>No, a double murder.</i>

22:59.630 --> 23:03.042
<i>They are two miles north</i>
<i>of park headquarters.</i>

23:03.042 --> 23:06.630
<i>They were in a white</i>
<i>Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia.</i>

23:08.168 --> 23:10.336
<i>I’m the one that did it.</i>

23:10.336 --> 23:12.504
<i>43L2 has a male victim with him.</i>

23:12.504 --> 23:15.126
<i>Piner's ambulance</i>
<i>has been dispatched.</i>

23:16.084 --> 23:18.336
Boy lived, the girl didn't. Again.

23:18.336 --> 23:20.798
God, can you imagine
surviving something like that?

23:20.798 --> 23:22.294
Writing the dates on the side of the car.

23:22.336 --> 23:25.504
We got two Vallejo killings,
now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?

23:25.504 --> 23:27.504
What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo?

23:27.504 --> 23:31.084
Sweet mother of Christ,
what are you drawing?

23:31.084 --> 23:32.714
Kid at the lake.

23:32.714 --> 23:34.588
This is what he said
the Zodiac was wearing.

23:34.588 --> 23:35.924
God, that's a hell of a get-up.

23:35.924 --> 23:38.630
-Paul, what are you doing?
-Hyman, I wrote it. It's done.

23:38.630 --> 23:39.798
Now I just got to type it up.

23:39.798 --> 23:42.042
Type it up?
It's not finished until you type it up.

23:42.042 --> 23:43.840
We've got to read it.

23:46.420 --> 23:49.336
-What's that?
-That's the Zodiac at the lake.

23:49.336 --> 23:50.882
What's the story with the kid?

23:50.882 --> 23:53.336
He seems a little touched
or medicated or...

23:53.336 --> 23:54.588
-Graysmith?
-Yeah, what is it?

23:54.588 --> 23:56.168
He's a fucking boy scout.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.504
He doesn't smoke,
he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.000
-And he's back.
-I knew it.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.462
"Man is the most
dangerous animal of all."

24:01.462 --> 24:02.672
I knew that
I heard that from somewhere.

24:02.672 --> 24:05.042
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

24:05.042 --> 24:08.126
It's a movie about a Count
who hunts people for sport.

24:08.126 --> 24:09.252
People.

24:09.252 --> 24:11.252
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

24:12.000 --> 24:14.546
-Who's that?
-That's Count Zaroff.

24:14.546 --> 24:16.672
Zaroff? With a "Z"?

24:19.294 --> 24:21.126
<i>And that will be</i>
<i>all for the news on the 20.</i>

24:21.126 --> 24:23.756
<i>We've got curfews in effect tonight</i>
<i>for the following counties,</i>

24:23.756 --> 24:27.798
<i>Napa, Solano, Contra Costa,</i>
<i>Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo.</i>

24:27.798 --> 24:30.000
<i>So please, everyone, stay safe.</i>

24:30.000 --> 24:33.420
<i>Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line.</i>
<i>You're not scared of the Zodiac?</i>

24:33.420 --> 24:36.588
<i>Heck no,</i>
<i>he's only shooting those farm kids.</i>

24:36.588 --> 24:39.294
<i>What scares me</i>
<i>is those hippies out in the Haight</i>

24:39.294 --> 24:41.252
<i>with their free love and weird clothes.</i>

24:41.252 --> 24:43.378
<i>We've got Alfred from Vacaville.</i>

24:43.378 --> 24:45.756
<i>You know, I think</i>
<i>that was really offensive.</i>

24:45.756 --> 24:47.462
<i>It's not just farm kids.</i>

24:47.462 --> 24:49.420
<i>These are nice, clean-cut young people.</i>

24:49.420 --> 24:51.966
<i>Hey, nobody's downplaying</i>
<i>the loss of human life here, Alfred.</i>

24:51.966 --> 24:54.084
<i>Well, that last guy was.</i>

24:54.084 --> 24:57.000
<i>We have good solid communities</i>
<i>out here in the North Bay.</i>

24:57.000 --> 25:00.630
<i>Unlike in the city where you have</i>
<i>Satanists running around.</i>

25:00.630 --> 25:04.210
<i>Well, you bring up a good question.</i>
<i>Is the Zodiac a Satanist?</i>

25:04.210 --> 25:06.000
<i>Amber from Oakland,</i>
<i>what do you think?</i>

25:06.000 --> 25:07.336
<i>I don't really know,</i>

25:07.336 --> 25:10.504
<i>but I thought that code</i>
<i>they printed didn't look very Christian.</i>

25:10.546 --> 25:13.336
<i>But I think the bigger problem</i>
<i>is that the papers shouldn't have printed</i>

25:13.336 --> 25:15.252
<i>anything that the Zodiac</i>
<i>has been doing.</i>

25:15.252 --> 25:18.504
<i>That they're just printing</i>
<i>all that stuff to sell more newspapers.</i>

25:18.504 --> 25:20.756
<i>Well, the Zodiac did demand</i>
<i>they print his letters</i>

25:20.756 --> 25:22.462
<i>or he'd kill more people.</i>

25:22.462 --> 25:23.882
<i>Yeah, but he would have</i>
<i>done it anyway,</i>

25:23.882 --> 25:25.546
<i>whether they printed it or not, I think.</i>

25:25.546 --> 25:27.084
<i>An interesting point.</i>

25:27.084 --> 25:29.252
<i>So, what do you think he'll do next?</i>

25:49.966 --> 25:53.420
<i>-San Francisco Police Department.</i>
<i>-Yes. There's a fight in a cab!</i>

25:53.420 --> 25:54.756
<i>What is your location?</i>

25:54.756 --> 25:57.840
<i>3398 Washington,</i>
<i>at the corner of Cherry.</i>

25:57.840 --> 25:59.672
<i>One's drunk and</i>
<i>we think he's robbing him.</i>

25:59.672 --> 26:03.042
<i>-Is the crime still in progress?</i>
<i>-Yes, please hurry.</i>

26:04.504 --> 26:06.126
Oh, my God, look!

26:29.000 --> 26:30.252
Nuts!

26:33.546 --> 26:35.462
Whoever this is,
you owe me a new lamp.

26:35.462 --> 26:38.168
<i>Cabbie's been shot</i>
<i>three blocks from the Presidio.</i>

26:38.168 --> 26:40.462
Well, it wasn't me.
I've been with my bride all night.

26:40.462 --> 26:43.546
-She can vouch.
-Go put on the Folgers.

26:43.546 --> 26:45.042
<i>You'll pick me up?</i>

26:45.042 --> 26:46.924
Let me just describe
the lamp you're gonna buy me.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.756
-I just got to sleep.
-Suspect's Negro, male adult.

26:58.756 --> 27:01.756
Walt's on scene, locked up the cab
and secured the crowd.

27:01.756 --> 27:04.378
Seriously, dead asleep.
I lost feeling in my arm and everything.

27:04.378 --> 27:05.714
Crackers.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.630
You ever try Japanese food?

27:11.630 --> 27:14.462
-What do you mean, like teriyaki?
-No, like the urchin.

27:14.462 --> 27:16.840
-Raw fish.
-I'm eating here, Bill.

27:18.168 --> 27:21.252
-I always wanted to try it.
-So, why don't you?

27:21.252 --> 27:23.252
Haven't got around to it.

27:38.840 --> 27:42.084
Evening, gents. What a lovely night
for a botched robbery.

27:42.084 --> 27:44.756
Yeah, third this week.
Must be end of summer rush.

27:44.756 --> 27:47.966
I got foot patrols going through the park,
dogs are on the way.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.378
The victim's name is Paul Stine.
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

27:52.378 --> 27:54.588
Suspect fired one shot
to the back of the head.

27:54.588 --> 27:56.588
Driver's wallet
and car keys are missing.

27:56.588 --> 27:57.714
How'd you know his name?

27:57.714 --> 28:00.756
Leroy, there, came down
from Yellow Cab to ID him.

28:00.756 --> 28:02.420
Neighborhood's pretty high-end
for this kind of thing,

28:02.420 --> 28:04.714
so I already set up transpo for the cab.

28:04.756 --> 28:06.294
-Coroner's here.
-Any witnesses?

28:06.294 --> 28:09.840
Kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.420
-Did they hear a shot?
-No.

28:11.420 --> 28:12.630
They first saw him in the front seat,

28:12.630 --> 28:14.630
thought he was a drunk
fighting with the driver.

28:14.630 --> 28:17.714
Oldest kid ran downstairs to get
a better look from the dining room,

28:17.714 --> 28:19.630
described him as a white male, glasses,

28:19.630 --> 28:21.924
crew-cut, stocky,
and wearing a dark jacket.

28:21.924 --> 28:23.840
Wait, I thought someone said
he was black.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.840
That's the description
that went out to radio cars.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.840
-We already corrected it.
-Oh, well, that's good.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.336
-You guys need anything else?
-No. Get out of here.

28:31.336 --> 28:33.378
Thanks. Happy Birthday.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.168
-Wait, it's your birthday?
-Yep.

28:36.168 --> 28:38.378
-That's great. Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

28:38.420 --> 28:41.504
-Body or scene?
-It's your birthday, I'll take the body.

28:41.504 --> 28:43.756
Dave, looks like he
wiped the cab down pretty good.

28:43.756 --> 28:46.252
-We got some blood over here.
-Prints?

28:46.252 --> 28:48.210
Could very well be.
We'll dust it at the Hall.

28:48.210 --> 28:51.042
The odd thing is, we also got gloves.

28:51.042 --> 28:53.462
-Suspect's?
-There's blood on them.

28:54.882 --> 28:56.168
-Hey, Pete?
-Yeah, Dave.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.462
You through over there,
can I get in there?

28:57.462 --> 28:59.126
Yeah, I'm all set.

29:00.042 --> 29:02.084
-Who rolled him?
-Stewarts.

29:08.966 --> 29:11.000
I got a single 9mm casing.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.882
Yeah, Luger.

29:17.420 --> 29:19.378
Nothing from the crowd.

29:19.378 --> 29:22.336
Okay.
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,

29:22.336 --> 29:25.798
who also happens to be
a stocky, crew-cut Caucasian.

29:25.798 --> 29:28.420
I flag a cab. I give him this address.

29:28.420 --> 29:31.294
Did I give him this address?
Who's got the fare book?

29:31.294 --> 29:32.672
Right here.

29:34.966 --> 29:37.882
Washington and Maple.
That's one block east.

29:58.966 --> 30:00.210
Lighting's the same over here,

30:00.210 --> 30:02.756
so maybe I see
someone walking their dog.

30:02.756 --> 30:05.672
You don't want any witnesses
so you tell him to go down a block.

30:05.672 --> 30:06.840
He pulls over.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.882
I wait for him to put it in park
because I'm smart

30:08.882 --> 30:10.294
and I don't want him
hitting the accelerator

30:10.294 --> 30:11.672
when I shoot him. May I?

30:11.672 --> 30:14.126
He stops, puts it in park, boom.

30:14.126 --> 30:16.924
I shoot him on the right side,
he slumps right?

30:16.924 --> 30:19.042
Maybe you've got your hand
on his collar when you shoot.

30:19.042 --> 30:20.294
All right. So, either way,

30:20.294 --> 30:22.084
I just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat.

30:22.084 --> 30:25.336
-So, why do you get in the front seat?
-For the money.

30:25.336 --> 30:26.462
But he's dead.

30:26.462 --> 30:28.294
You could just reach over the seat,
pull out his wallet.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.546
You don't have to go
anywhere near the blood.

30:30.546 --> 30:33.042
So, why'd he get in the front seat?

30:33.546 --> 30:35.252
-I'm an idiot.
-But you're not an idiot.

30:35.252 --> 30:37.084
You waited for him to put it in park.

30:37.084 --> 30:39.294
-Right. Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.882
-Can I see that?
-Yeah.

30:43.378 --> 30:46.756
I am an idiot.
I just killed a man for $8.25.

30:46.756 --> 30:51.084
It's his third fare of the night.
Does anyone have any animal crackers?

30:51.588 --> 30:53.924
-Animal crackers?
-They're in the car.

30:53.924 --> 30:56.210
I'm saving those for later.

30:56.210 --> 30:57.378
Fine.

31:01.840 --> 31:05.630
-Are you a reporter?
-No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, SFPD.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.294
Sir, I was wondering
if I'd be able to talk to your children,

31:08.294 --> 31:10.630
one at a time and preferably alone?

31:10.630 --> 31:13.000
They just saw a man murdered.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.126
I understand.

31:14.462 --> 31:16.210
It looked like
they were drunk and fighting.

31:16.210 --> 31:17.630
Yeah, and he had a rag.

31:17.630 --> 31:20.084
He came around the side of the car
and he was wiping stuff.

31:20.084 --> 31:23.546
-Did you get a chance to see his face?
-I did.

31:23.546 --> 31:25.042
Well, sort of.

31:26.336 --> 31:28.882
Did you remember what he looked like?

31:30.336 --> 31:32.420
-Normal.
-Yeah.

31:32.420 --> 31:33.756
"Normal?"

31:56.462 --> 31:58.126
<i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

31:58.126 --> 32:00.588
<i>"I am the murderer of the taxi driver</i>

32:00.588 --> 32:04.126
"over by Washington Street
and Maple Street last night.

32:04.126 --> 32:06.672
"To prove this, here is
a blood-stained piece of his shirt.

32:06.672 --> 32:11.714
"I am the same man who did in
the people in the North Bay Area.

32:11.714 --> 32:14.378
"The S.F. Police could have
caught him last night

32:14.378 --> 32:16.000
"if they had searched the park properly

32:16.000 --> 32:19.378
"instead of holding road races
with their motorcicles."

32:19.378 --> 32:21.000
-Gentlemen.
-Dave.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.966
Paul. Where's the shirt?

32:24.378 --> 32:26.042
Right there, boss.

32:27.168 --> 32:28.840
There's your rag the kids talked about.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.924
So he got in the front seat
to tear off a piece of the shirt.

32:30.924 --> 32:33.420
-Is this on the record?
-Well, what do you think?

32:33.420 --> 32:35.588
He confirms
the Vallejo and Napa killings.

32:35.588 --> 32:37.252
Gets worse.

32:37.252 --> 32:39.378
Robert, do you have a deadline?

32:39.378 --> 32:41.630
What does he mean, it gets worse?

32:41.630 --> 32:43.126
Read the last part.

32:43.126 --> 32:45.462
"School children make nice targets.

32:45.462 --> 32:47.840
"I think I shall wipe out
a school bus some morning.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.630
"Just shoot out the front tire

32:49.630 --> 32:52.126
"and then pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out."

32:52.126 --> 32:54.756
Jesus Christ, who's got school buses?
Department of Transportation?

32:54.756 --> 32:56.756
-School board.
-All right.

32:56.756 --> 32:59.126
I'm gonna need elimination prints
from your staff.

32:59.126 --> 33:01.882
Has anyone here
didn't touch this letter?

33:06.084 --> 33:08.378
On my way back to my desk.
They have phones, if you want.

33:08.378 --> 33:10.084
We need to get matches
on blood and fabric.

33:10.084 --> 33:11.336
I'll call Napa and Vallejo,

33:11.336 --> 33:13.252
get the letters up to Sherwood
in Sacramento.

33:13.252 --> 33:16.756
Dave, just one thing.
Is it true they got a print off the cab?

33:16.756 --> 33:19.126
Yeah, we got a partial in blood.

33:19.966 --> 33:23.168
-But that is not for publication.
-Hey, hey, come on.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.504
Hey, it's me.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.630
Did he say they got a print?

33:28.714 --> 33:29.966
Partial.

33:30.924 --> 33:32.000
Whoa.

33:33.378 --> 33:34.840
Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt.

33:34.840 --> 33:37.420
No, McQueen got that from Toschi.

33:37.420 --> 33:39.294
Does he think that Zodiac's
gonna send another code?

33:39.294 --> 33:41.210
'Cause I think Zodiac's
gonna send another code.

33:41.210 --> 33:43.336
Jesus Harold Christ
on rubber crutches, Bobby.

33:43.336 --> 33:44.462
What are you doing?

33:44.462 --> 33:45.882
You're doing that thing,
the thing we discussed,

33:45.882 --> 33:48.462
the thing that I don't like.
Starts with an "L."

33:48.462 --> 33:50.462
-Oh, looming.
-Yeah.

33:50.462 --> 33:53.462
In cooperation with SFPD ,
we will run the Zodiac letter

33:53.462 --> 33:56.252
without including the threat
on school children.

33:56.252 --> 33:58.000
We don't want to start a city-wide panic

33:58.000 --> 34:01.630
so I'm asking all of you
to please keep this confidential.

34:01.630 --> 34:03.924
Just go about your daily business.

34:03.924 --> 34:05.294
Thank you.

34:20.966 --> 34:24.084
I packed you your carrots
and your soda and peanut butter, okay?

34:24.084 --> 34:27.084
-Dad, you don't have to wait with me.
-I know.

34:34.420 --> 34:38.252
You know what? You know what?
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?

34:38.714 --> 34:39.966
Come on.

34:57.966 --> 34:59.756
What's that?

34:59.756 --> 35:02.294
Similarities in the lowercase "r's."

35:11.462 --> 35:12.714
And that?

35:12.714 --> 35:14.756
It is you waiting in the hall
if you speak again.

35:14.756 --> 35:16.630
I have to concentrate.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.210
Sorry.

35:18.210 --> 35:20.378
"Sorry" counts as speaking.

35:31.084 --> 35:34.084
There are similarities
in the lowercase "r's."

35:38.126 --> 35:40.588
We have to release the bus threat.

35:41.168 --> 35:43.882
-It'll screw us.
-We're already screwed.

35:43.882 --> 35:46.210
We just went from
"Routine Cabbie Shooting"

35:46.210 --> 35:48.420
to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids."

35:56.210 --> 35:59.378
<i>The Zodiac Killer</i>
<i>has come to San Francisco.</i>

35:59.378 --> 36:00.462
<i>Confirmation tonight,</i>

36:00.462 --> 36:02.504
<i>from the San Francisco</i>
<i>Police Department</i>

36:02.504 --> 36:04.546
<i>that in his latest haunting letter,</i>

36:04.546 --> 36:07.840
<i>which takes credit for the murder</i>
<i>of cab driver Paul Stine,</i>

36:07.840 --> 36:11.336
<i>the Zodiac has threatened to,</i>
<i>"Wipe out a school bus</i>

36:11.336 --> 36:14.672
<i>"and pick off the kiddies</i>
<i>as they come bouncing out."</i>

36:18.126 --> 36:20.882
<i>If you think you might know</i>
<i>who the Zodiac is,</i>

36:20.882 --> 36:25.042
<i>you can call the San Francisco</i>
<i>Police Department's newest tip line.</i>

36:48.168 --> 36:51.546
Press conference is at 4:00.
We got to give them something.

36:51.546 --> 36:53.042
We're coordinating
with the school board,

36:53.042 --> 36:55.042
and we expect
a break in the case very soon.

36:55.042 --> 36:56.882
-What do we really got?
-We're swamped.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.378
When they can't get anyone
on the tip line

36:58.378 --> 37:00.168
they call the switchboard
and keep getting put through.

37:00.168 --> 37:01.252
You got any hard suspects?

37:01.252 --> 37:04.084
About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

37:04.084 --> 37:05.294
Well, can't you narrow it down?

37:05.294 --> 37:07.546
I would love to,
if I could get out of this...

37:07.546 --> 37:11.126
-Homicide, please hold.
-Yeah, hold, please.

37:11.126 --> 37:12.966
We're gonna need to tell them
we got the entire force on this.

37:12.966 --> 37:14.336
How many men can you give me?

37:14.336 --> 37:16.462
Well, right now, it's you and Bill
and Monday's a school day.

37:16.462 --> 37:18.462
Yeah, I know, Chief.
I have three daughters of my own.

37:18.462 --> 37:20.504
Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong?

37:20.504 --> 37:22.042
He's on the phone with Vallejo.

37:22.042 --> 37:24.084
We're playing catch up, Jack.

37:24.084 --> 37:26.714
I'd like to set up a meeting
with your survivor, Michael Mageau.

37:26.714 --> 37:28.378
I can't. He skipped town.

37:28.378 --> 37:31.126
The only guy who's seen Zodiac
without a mask is missing?

37:31.126 --> 37:34.378
When he was still in the hospital
we could show him lineups all day long.

37:34.378 --> 37:35.882
As soon as he got out, he split.

37:35.882 --> 37:37.000
<i>Really? Why?</i>

37:37.000 --> 37:39.294
I don't think he wanted
to have anything to do with this.

37:39.294 --> 37:41.588
<i>Can you send us everything</i>
<i>that you have?</i>

37:41.588 --> 37:44.420
Well, the road goes both ways.

37:44.420 --> 37:47.630
Now, we need that print
you lifted from the cab

37:47.630 --> 37:49.672
<i>and we should have been in</i>
<i>on the handwriting.</i>

37:49.672 --> 37:52.042
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

37:52.042 --> 37:54.882
<i>Who should I talk to in Napa</i>
<i>so we can coordinate?</i>

37:54.882 --> 37:56.126
Talk to Ken Narlow.

37:56.126 --> 37:58.084
We really should have been in
on the handwriting.

37:58.084 --> 38:00.672
<i>I apologize.</i>
<i>Things have been moving fast.</i>

38:00.672 --> 38:02.210
<i>Listen, we're gonna need</i>
<i>your scene photos.</i>

38:02.210 --> 38:03.336
Can't help you.

38:03.336 --> 38:05.378
<i>Ken, I don't want to get into</i>
<i>a jurisdictional thing here.</i>

38:05.378 --> 38:08.084
No, no, no, no, no.
We didn't have a crime scene.

38:08.084 --> 38:11.420
The ranger that found the kids literally
swept everything into a picnic blanket.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.210
<i>All we have are the Wing Walker prints.</i>

38:13.210 --> 38:14.420
The what?

38:14.420 --> 38:16.210
Boot prints to and from the crime scene

38:16.210 --> 38:17.966
were made by size
10-and-a-half Wing Walkers,

38:17.966 --> 38:21.420
military-style boots
sold only at military PXs

38:21.882 --> 38:23.798
designed to walk
on the wings of planes.

38:23.798 --> 38:26.630
<i>And you can't buy at a PX</i>
<i>without a military ID,</i>

38:26.630 --> 38:28.672
so our suspect could be military.

38:28.672 --> 38:30.504
Did you guys narrow your list off of this?

38:30.546 --> 38:32.714
-Yeah.
<i>-Did Vallejo?</i>

38:32.714 --> 38:34.924
I don't know. I don't work in Vallejo.
I work here.

38:34.924 --> 38:37.168
Great. I'm gonna need photos
of those boot prints.

38:37.168 --> 38:39.210
<i>Sure, if you send me the handwriting.</i>

38:39.252 --> 38:40.924
I thought Questioned Documents
already did.

38:40.924 --> 38:42.546
Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us.

38:42.546 --> 38:44.630
All right.
I'll have Questioned Documents...

38:44.630 --> 38:46.630
Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.

38:46.630 --> 38:48.210
We don't have telefax yet.

38:48.210 --> 38:50.924
-Okay, I'll put it in the mail.
<i>-We'll mail ours, too.</i>

38:50.924 --> 38:52.672
And call Mulanax in Vallejo.

38:52.672 --> 38:54.882
-Maybe he can get you a mimeo.
-Right.

38:54.882 --> 38:57.336
Why don't you just get a photo
off the original plaster cast?

38:57.336 --> 38:59.546
We'd have to wait,
because they don't have a fax.

38:59.546 --> 39:01.084
<i>We don't have a fax, either.</i>

39:01.084 --> 39:02.924
Look, I'm just trying
to get us coordinated.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.504
Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office?

39:04.504 --> 39:06.210
Why would I call Solano?

39:06.210 --> 39:09.924
<i>Because the two kids that got killed</i>
<i>last Christmas were Solano's.</i>

39:09.924 --> 39:11.210
I thought they were Vallejo.

39:11.210 --> 39:12.630
No, they were over the county line

39:12.630 --> 39:14.924
so you're gonna need
to coordinate with them, too.

39:14.924 --> 39:16.462
Okay.

39:16.462 --> 39:17.588
Bill.

39:18.252 --> 39:20.168
Can I have a word with you?

39:23.084 --> 39:25.210
Where did you see this guy?

39:25.966 --> 39:28.504
We got the call to circle the scene
and look for a Negro male adult.

39:28.504 --> 39:30.084
Where was he?

39:30.084 --> 39:32.630
On Jackson. Heading east.
About the middle of the block.

39:32.630 --> 39:34.756
And this is three minutes
after the shooting?

39:34.756 --> 39:36.000
Give or take. Yeah.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.378
-And you were heading east or west?
-We were going west.

39:38.378 --> 39:40.714
All right, so you're
on Jackson going west.

39:40.714 --> 39:43.924
So the cab was one block
catty-corner southwest?

39:43.924 --> 39:45.714
-Correct.
-Did you slow down?

39:45.714 --> 39:47.546
-Of course we slowed down.
-All right.

39:47.546 --> 39:49.882
Listen, Dispatch said
it was a Negro male.

39:49.882 --> 39:51.252
That was corrected.

39:51.252 --> 39:54.000
No, but at the time
they hadn't changed it.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.168
This guy was white.

39:56.168 --> 39:58.126
Right, not in a hurry.
Kind of lumbering along like...

39:58.126 --> 40:00.966
Lumbering?
What do you mean, "lumbering"?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.756
-Shuffling.
-Stocky? Had a crew cut?

40:05.672 --> 40:08.000
Yeah, that's all correct.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.798
Listen, it was dark.

40:10.672 --> 40:12.840
The guy was wearing a dark jacket.
There's no way...

40:12.840 --> 40:15.336
He would have been covered in blood.

40:16.924 --> 40:18.546
Did you stop him?

40:20.588 --> 40:22.378
Did you talk to him?

40:22.966 --> 40:24.924
-Yes? No?
-No.

40:25.798 --> 40:27.420
You need to get with a sketch artist.

40:27.420 --> 40:30.420
We have to put out
a new composite right away.

40:33.504 --> 40:36.546
<i>Five persons have been murdered</i>
<i>in the San Francisco area,</i>

40:36.546 --> 40:38.042
<i>and in each case the killer...</i>

40:38.042 --> 40:40.672
<i>"I shall wipe out a school bus</i>
<i>some morning..."</i>

40:40.672 --> 40:42.294
<i>San Francisco police...</i>

40:44.168 --> 40:46.714
<i>...to see the Stones in concert</i>
<i>this Sunday.</i>

40:47.000 --> 40:49.168
<i>The new letters</i>
<i>from the Zodiac Killer were sent to</i>

40:49.168 --> 40:51.294
<i>the City room of the</i>
San Francisco Chronicle.

40:51.294 --> 40:52.546
<i>One of the letters was...</i>

40:52.546 --> 40:55.210
Looming. No looming.

40:55.210 --> 40:58.420
-Have you considered the water theory?
-What?

40:58.420 --> 41:01.336
Geographically, every attack
takes place near a body of water

41:01.336 --> 41:02.588
-or a water-based name.
-This is your water theory?

41:02.588 --> 41:05.126
Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.

41:05.126 --> 41:07.798
-Lake Herman.
-Wash-ington and Cherry?

41:09.252 --> 41:10.966
You think?

41:10.966 --> 41:12.084
No.

41:12.084 --> 41:13.588
I'm reading this book,

41:13.588 --> 41:15.336
<i>Homicide Investigation</i>
by Lemoyne Snyder...

41:15.336 --> 41:16.840
-"Leymone."
-...and he says you look for patterns,

41:16.840 --> 41:19.042
-so I'm looking for patterns.
-No.

41:19.042 --> 41:21.462
You can't think of this case
in normal police terms.

41:21.462 --> 41:23.714
-Why not?
-You got four crime scenes.

41:23.714 --> 41:26.756
Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here.

41:26.756 --> 41:30.462
Not a single usable print
at the first three or in any of the letters?

41:30.924 --> 41:34.462
How does our master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent?

41:34.462 --> 41:37.126
I mean, assuming the gloves are his,

41:37.126 --> 41:38.966
he shoots the cabbie
and then takes them off?

41:38.966 --> 41:40.210
<i>So it's not his print?</i>

41:40.210 --> 41:42.084
Maybe, maybe not.
You're missing the point.

41:42.084 --> 41:44.798
-The point is the first attack...
-David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

41:44.798 --> 41:46.462
They both die.

41:46.462 --> 41:49.000
From there on out,
he only manages to kill the girls.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.042
-Not for lack of trying.
-Not for lack of trying.

41:51.042 --> 41:54.714
Mageau lives, Ferrin dies.
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.

41:54.714 --> 41:58.168
He gets so caught up with the women
he forgets to finish off the men.

41:58.168 --> 42:00.588
Plus, they're all couples
and all on lover's lanes.

42:00.588 --> 42:02.546
-Paul Stine is not.
-Exactly.

42:02.546 --> 42:04.840
Single, male cab driver
on Washington and Cherry doesn't fit.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.252
Doesn't fit.

42:07.126 --> 42:09.420
So, why does Zodiac kill him?

42:12.210 --> 42:14.252
He's breaking the pattern.

42:23.420 --> 42:24.546
Yeah?

42:24.546 --> 42:28.378
<i>Someone claiming to be Zodiac</i>
<i>called Oakland PD a half-hour ago.</i>

42:28.378 --> 42:31.714
<i>He says he's gonna call in on Jim</i>
<i>Dunbar's morning show in three hours.</i>

42:31.714 --> 42:32.882
On television?

42:32.924 --> 42:35.084
<i>He wants Melvin Belli on</i>
<i>to counsel him.</i>

42:35.084 --> 42:37.210
All right. All right.
Let's go wake up Melvin.

42:39.630 --> 42:41.630
Animal crackers?

42:41.630 --> 42:43.000
Glove box.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.798
Are these windows bulletproof?

42:44.798 --> 42:47.462
Yes, Melvin.
You don't have to lie down back there.

42:47.462 --> 42:48.756
This man is a marksman,

42:48.756 --> 42:51.672
could snuff me out
at a moment's notice.

42:51.672 --> 42:53.168
Are you sure you're up for this?

42:53.168 --> 42:57.672
Don't you worry about me, Inspector.
I'll be fine when the lights are on.

42:57.672 --> 42:59.546
This man has asked for my help.

42:59.546 --> 43:01.714
The man you're worrying about
snuffing you out?

43:01.714 --> 43:03.672
What are these, cookies?

43:05.336 --> 43:07.462
Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?

43:07.756 --> 43:11.210
-Shit.
-KGO must have tipped other stations.

43:20.756 --> 43:23.798
<i>Get him talking.</i>
<i>Convince him to meet you somewhere.</i>

43:23.798 --> 43:25.168
If you see an opportunity,

43:25.168 --> 43:28.000
we want you to suggest
Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.294
You'll be tracing the call?

43:29.294 --> 43:32.504
Pacific Telephone says you need to
keep him on the line for 15 minutes.

43:32.504 --> 43:34.756
We can do that, can't we, Jim?

43:37.084 --> 43:39.462
Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.

43:45.798 --> 43:48.126
Here you go, you drunken reprobate.

43:48.126 --> 43:52.000
<i>We interrupt our regular program</i>
<i>to bring you this news bulletin.</i>

43:52.000 --> 43:54.084
<i>Welcome to this special edition</i>
<i>of our show</i>

43:54.084 --> 43:56.042
<i>in which we are joined</i>
<i>by attorney Melvin Belli</i>

43:56.042 --> 43:59.504
<i>who the Zodiac Killer</i>
<i>personally requested to appear.</i>

43:59.504 --> 44:01.462
Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.

44:01.462 --> 44:04.546
<i>-Good morning, Melvin.</i>
<i>-Good morning, Jim.</i>

44:04.546 --> 44:07.882
<i>So, the phone lines are open.</i>
<i>Mr. Belli is here.</i>

44:07.882 --> 44:09.042
<i>Here to help, Jim.</i>

44:09.042 --> 44:10.966
<i>Yes. Here to help.</i>

44:10.966 --> 44:15.714
<i>And we ask the public not to call in,</i>
<i>so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.</i>

44:24.756 --> 44:28.252
I saw your Star Trek, by the way.
It was excellent.

44:28.252 --> 44:30.294
A shame about the show.

44:30.294 --> 44:31.840
Good people.

44:31.840 --> 44:35.672
You know, I've often thought of
becoming an actor full-time.

44:35.672 --> 44:37.042
What was your character's name?

44:37.042 --> 44:39.294
<i>-Gorgon.</i>
<i>-Gorgon. That's right.</i>

44:40.798 --> 44:42.798
Roll the tape. Get the tape.

44:42.798 --> 44:45.462
Jim, we have a call. We're going live.

44:46.714 --> 44:47.924
Hello?

44:51.420 --> 44:53.630
Hello? This is Melvin Belli.

44:54.798 --> 44:56.966
Who am I speaking with?

44:56.966 --> 44:59.378
<i>This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

45:02.504 --> 45:06.378
Is there something I can call you
that's a little less ominous?

45:08.336 --> 45:09.420
<i>Sam.</i>

45:10.000 --> 45:11.966
Sam.

45:12.294 --> 45:15.966
Is there somewhere we can meet, Sam,
and talk about this?

45:16.378 --> 45:19.714
<i>Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel.</i>

45:19.756 --> 45:21.588
<i>Without anyone else or I’ll jump...</i>

45:21.588 --> 45:23.504
Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.

45:23.504 --> 45:25.756
<i>-Sam.</i>
-Yes?

45:26.420 --> 45:29.966
Do you think you need medical care?

45:29.966 --> 45:31.966
<i>Medical, not mental.</i>

45:31.966 --> 45:34.336
Do you have health problems?

45:34.336 --> 45:36.168
<i>I’m sick. I have headaches.</i>

45:36.168 --> 45:38.000
Headaches?

45:38.000 --> 45:39.462
I have headaches, too,

45:39.462 --> 45:42.252
but a chiropractor stopped them
a week ago.

45:42.252 --> 45:44.084
I think I can help you, Sam.

45:46.504 --> 45:47.798
Sam?

45:49.714 --> 45:52.168
He knows they're tracing his calls.

45:55.840 --> 45:59.966
<i>Sam, we'd like you to know</i>
<i>that we are not tracing these calls.</i>

45:59.966 --> 46:04.252
<i>It's a long, difficult process</i>
<i>and ineffective with these short calls.</i>

46:09.714 --> 46:10.798
Sam?

46:13.042 --> 46:16.168
We're not tracing these calls.
You have my word.

46:17.042 --> 46:18.252
<i>Okay.</i>

46:18.714 --> 46:22.084
<i>Sam, you need to tell me</i>
<i>what your problem is.</i>

46:22.084 --> 46:24.042
<i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.</i>

46:24.042 --> 46:26.672
<i>I have headaches.</i>
<i>I kill, I don't get them.</i>

46:26.672 --> 46:28.084
That is fucked up!

46:28.084 --> 46:31.672
<i>You want to live, don't you?</i>
<i>Well, this is your passport.</i>

46:31.672 --> 46:33.168
<i>How long have you been</i>
<i>having these headaches?</i>

46:33.168 --> 46:35.210
<i>Since I killed a kid.</i>

46:36.126 --> 46:38.462
-Do you have blackouts?
<i>-Yes.</i>

46:38.462 --> 46:42.294
-Do you have fits?
<i>-No. I just have headaches.</i>

46:42.294 --> 46:44.000
Did you attempt to call one other time

46:44.000 --> 46:46.672
when F. Lee Bailey was with us
two or three weeks ago?

46:46.672 --> 46:47.798
<i>Yes.</i>

46:47.798 --> 46:49.714
And why did you want
to talk to Mr. Bailey?

46:49.714 --> 46:52.756
Why do you wanna tal k to me, Sam?

46:52.756 --> 46:54.504
<i>-I don't want to be hurt.</i>
-Why is he calling?

46:54.504 --> 46:56.546
-Hey, just a second, buddy.
<i>-I don't wanna go to the gas chamber.</i>

46:56.546 --> 46:58.336
<i>You won't get hurt if you talk to me.</i>

46:58.336 --> 47:01.420
And you're not going
to the gas chamber.

47:01.420 --> 47:03.924
I wouldn't think they would ask
for capital punishment.

47:03.924 --> 47:06.168
<i>We should ask the District Attorney.</i>

47:06.168 --> 47:08.336
<i>Do you want me to do that, Sam?</i>

47:08.336 --> 47:11.084
<i>Do you want me to talk</i>
<i>to the District Attorney?</i>

47:14.966 --> 47:16.714
What was that, Sam?

47:17.672 --> 47:19.840
<i>I did not say anything.</i>

47:19.840 --> 47:21.798
<i>We heard a scream.</i>

47:22.546 --> 47:24.714
<i>That was my headache.</i>

47:25.504 --> 47:28.504
You sound like you're in
a great deal of pain.

47:29.210 --> 47:32.294
<i>My head aches. I’m so sick.</i>

47:34.126 --> 47:35.756
<i>I’m gonna kill them.</i>

47:35.756 --> 47:38.672
-Oh, okay.
<i>-I’m gonna kill those kids!</i>

47:38.672 --> 47:40.294
Fantastic.

47:42.840 --> 47:44.294
<i>Sam?</i>

47:45.798 --> 47:50.126
<i>-Let's meet and talk. Just us.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

47:50.168 --> 47:52.924
<i>How about Old St. Mary's Church</i>
<i>in Chinatown?</i>

47:52.924 --> 47:54.336
<i>No.</i>

47:54.336 --> 47:58.294
<i>In front of the Daly City</i>
<i>St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.</i>

47:58.294 --> 48:00.042
I'll see you there.

48:01.798 --> 48:03.756
Take care of yourself, Sam.

48:28.042 --> 48:29.336
My, my, my.

48:29.336 --> 48:33.084
You fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting.

48:35.420 --> 48:37.042
<i>You know, the problem is,</i>

48:37.042 --> 48:39.966
<i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.</i>
<i>I have headaches.</i>

48:39.966 --> 48:42.084
<i>I kill, I don't get them.</i>

48:42.084 --> 48:43.756
No, it's not him.

48:44.798 --> 48:48.042
It's the voice.
The voice is too high. It's too young.

48:48.042 --> 48:50.378
All right.
Thanks for coming down, Bryan.

48:50.378 --> 48:51.756
<i>Do you have blackouts?</i>

48:51.756 --> 48:53.630
That's okay. I got it.

48:59.798 --> 49:00.924
They pulled off the trace.

49:00.924 --> 49:04.294
Our Daly City no-show
called from a mental institution.

49:04.294 --> 49:06.252
Oakland PD's operator is sure

49:06.252 --> 49:08.840
the man she talked to
had a deeper voice.

49:08.840 --> 49:10.000
Calmer.

49:10.840 --> 49:13.042
Might have actually been him.

49:19.336 --> 49:22.630
"So I shall change
my way of collecting slaves.

49:22.630 --> 49:26.210
"I shall no longer announce to anyone
when I commit my murders.

49:26.210 --> 49:29.504
"They shall look like routine robberies,
killings of anger

49:29.504 --> 49:32.588
"and a few fake accidents, et cetera.

49:32.588 --> 49:33.756
"The police shall never catch me

49:33.756 --> 49:36.252
"because I have been
too clever for them.

49:36.252 --> 49:39.882
"I look like the description passed out
only when I do my thing.

49:39.882 --> 49:43.042
"The rest of the time
I look entirely different.

49:43.042 --> 49:47.546
"I shall not tell you what
my disguise consists of when I kill.

49:48.126 --> 49:50.756
"As of yet I have left no
fingerprints behind me,

49:50.756 --> 49:53.378
"contrary to what the police say.

49:53.378 --> 49:55.756
"I wear transparent fingertips.

49:56.714 --> 50:01.546
"All it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips.

50:01.546 --> 50:06.126
"I enjoy needling the blue pigs.
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.

50:06.126 --> 50:11.672
"You were using fire trucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars.

50:11.714 --> 50:13.210
"Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up

50:13.210 --> 50:16.420
"to have your nose
rubbed in your booboos?

50:16.420 --> 50:19.588
"If you cops think I am going to take
on a bus the way I stated I was,

50:19.588 --> 50:22.840
"you deserve to have holes
in your heads."

50:24.756 --> 50:26.966
And you need to look at this.

50:29.798 --> 50:32.294
"Take one bag of
ammonium nitrate fertilizer,

50:32.294 --> 50:34.042
"one gallon of stove oil,

50:34.042 --> 50:36.294
"and dump a few bags
of gravel on top..."

50:36.294 --> 50:38.126
-Okay.
-It's a bomb.

50:38.126 --> 50:40.000
Okay. We gotta call the Army
and see if this

50:40.000 --> 50:42.840
science experiment could actually work.

50:42.840 --> 50:44.378
Another cipher.

50:46.588 --> 50:49.378
-When did these arrive?
-They arrived this morning.

50:49.378 --> 50:50.882
Are you planning to publish?

50:50.882 --> 50:52.084
Robert.

50:53.588 --> 50:55.546
We should have a drink.

50:59.672 --> 51:01.084
Thank you.

51:02.882 --> 51:05.210
So, tell me about yourself.

51:05.210 --> 51:08.756
-You married?
-Divorced. Two kids.

51:09.756 --> 51:11.672
What do you do for fun?

51:13.168 --> 51:14.798
I love to read.

51:15.714 --> 51:18.294
-I enjoy books.
-Those are the same things.

51:18.294 --> 51:20.840
Why you been going through my trash?

51:23.672 --> 51:25.546
I'll come back to that.

51:26.042 --> 51:27.840
How did you know
he was gonna send another code?

51:27.840 --> 51:29.672
I just guessed.

51:29.672 --> 51:31.924
-Just guessed.
-The first one seemed too easy.

51:31.924 --> 51:34.378
All right, this can no longer be ignored.

51:34.378 --> 51:38.084
-What is that you're drinking?
-It's an Aqua Velva.

51:38.084 --> 51:41.000
You wouldn't make fun of it
if you tried it.

51:50.504 --> 51:52.924
But who actually cracked the code?

51:53.714 --> 51:56.042
A married couple who like puzzles.

51:56.042 --> 51:58.294
So what's that tell us about the Zodiac?

51:58.294 --> 51:59.714
-He's no expert.
-Right.

51:59.714 --> 52:01.462
It's just a simple substitution code

52:01.462 --> 52:03.756
like the one that
we used to do as boy scouts.

52:03.756 --> 52:05.504
"A" is one, "B" is two.

52:05.504 --> 52:06.924
We weren't all boy scouts, Robert.

52:06.924 --> 52:10.588
Well, it's not that hard.
You just got to know where to start.

52:10.588 --> 52:12.462
In the first cipher...

52:12.462 --> 52:13.798
You actually carry that around with you?

52:13.798 --> 52:15.504
-Why?
-No reason.

52:16.630 --> 52:20.168
What's the most common double
consonant in the English language?

52:20.168 --> 52:21.336
Consonant?

52:21.336 --> 52:22.756
-The double "L."
-Double "L."

52:22.756 --> 52:26.714
And what's the one word that we know
that he'll use in here, at least once?

52:26.714 --> 52:27.882
-"Kill."
-Right, "kill."

52:27.882 --> 52:29.420
So the Hardens start looking
for double symbols,

52:29.420 --> 52:31.504
which they find here, here, and here.

52:31.504 --> 52:34.042
Each with the same
two symbols preceding them.

52:34.042 --> 52:36.084
So now they've got
a repeating four-letter word

52:36.084 --> 52:38.210
ending with two symbols
that they assume stand for "L."

52:38.210 --> 52:39.756
And since they think the whole word
is "kill" then...

52:39.756 --> 52:43.210
Then you got your "K," you got your "I,"
and you're on your way.

52:43.210 --> 52:45.168
But how do you go
from "A" is one and "B" is two

52:45.168 --> 52:46.630
to figuring out this whole code?

52:46.630 --> 52:49.546
Well, same way I did.
You go to the library.

52:52.840 --> 52:54.840
In this book,

52:54.840 --> 52:59.042
the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface.

52:59.042 --> 53:02.084
Eight of the 26 symbols that
he suggests are found in this cipher.

53:02.084 --> 53:03.462
Yeah, but there are non-letter symbols

53:03.462 --> 53:04.966
because there's all
these medieval ones.

53:04.966 --> 53:07.546
I thought they looked medieval, too.

53:08.420 --> 53:10.294
But then I found a code
written in the Middle Ages.

53:10.294 --> 53:11.378
Guess what it's called?

53:12.126 --> 53:13.924
The Zodiac Alphabet.

53:15.882 --> 53:17.084
Jesus.

53:18.252 --> 53:19.798
What do you want out of this?

53:19.798 --> 53:21.378
-What?
-What's your angle?

53:21.378 --> 53:24.252
This is good business
for everyone but you.

53:27.378 --> 53:29.168
How do you mean "business"?

53:32.210 --> 53:34.672
Hey. Come to bed.

53:34.672 --> 53:37.966
I'll be up in a minute.
I need to make a phone call.

53:49.546 --> 53:51.252
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Bill?

53:52.084 --> 53:54.546
There's not many basements
in California.

53:54.546 --> 53:56.798
<i>"Basement for future use."</i>

53:56.840 --> 53:58.420
That's right.

53:58.420 --> 54:02.168
<i>I’ll have Vallejo and Napa</i>
<i>check with their city planners.</i>

54:02.168 --> 54:04.378
<i>-Get some sleep.</i>
-Yeah, sure.

54:17.294 --> 54:20.252
<i>"Dear Melvin,</i>
<i>this is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

54:20.252 --> 54:22.504
<i>"I wish you a happy Christmas.</i>

54:22.504 --> 54:26.042
<i>"The one thing I ask of you is this.</i>
<i>Please help me.</i>

54:26.042 --> 54:29.546
"I cannot reach out for help
because this thing in me won't let me."

54:29.546 --> 54:31.000
Thank you.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.294
"I am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check

54:34.294 --> 54:37.000
"and I am afraid I will lose control again

54:37.000 --> 54:39.924
"and take my ninth
and possibly tenth victim."

54:39.924 --> 54:42.336
Melvin, he's reaching out to you.

54:42.336 --> 54:43.756
Absolutely.

54:43.756 --> 54:47.378
Inspectors, he sent this letter
directly to my residence.

54:47.420 --> 54:50.546
It is a cry for help,
intended as a private communiqué.

54:50.546 --> 54:52.756
Which is why
you contacted the Chronicle.

54:52.756 --> 54:55.882
The people have a right to know.
Toddy?

54:55.882 --> 54:59.042
-When did the letter arrive?
-In the middle of last week.

54:59.042 --> 55:01.546
I was away on safari.

55:01.546 --> 55:03.420
What did you gentlemen
do for Christmas?

55:03.420 --> 55:05.840
-You're looking at it.
-You must see Africa.

55:05.840 --> 55:11.126
Cradle of civilization.
Fascinating people. Beautiful. Savage.

55:11.126 --> 55:15.000
-Back to the killer who wrote to you.
-Yes. Of course.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
It is my belief
that he only penned this letter

55:17.000 --> 55:20.126
because he couldn't get through to me
on the Dunbar show or here.

55:20.126 --> 55:22.756
-He tried to contact you here?
-Several times.

55:22.756 --> 55:25.000
I was out,
but he spoke with my housekeeper.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.168
Didn't leave a number.

55:26.168 --> 55:28.798
He's kind of crafty like that.
Do you mind if I speak to her?

55:28.798 --> 55:32.000
Not at all. But the real story is the letter.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.168
-I'll be back.
-Yeah.

55:34.168 --> 55:35.420
She's right this way.

55:35.420 --> 55:40.840
Inspector Toschi, it is my belief
this is a window into this man's soul.

55:40.840 --> 55:42.672
Killing is his compulsion.

55:42.672 --> 55:45.336
Even though he tries to ignore it,
it drives him.

55:45.378 --> 55:46.504
It's in his blood.

55:46.504 --> 55:49.588
Could be.
Or maybe he just likes the attention.

56:33.420 --> 56:38.798
I didn't mean to scare you,
but your right rear wheel is loose.

56:38.798 --> 56:39.924
Really?

56:39.924 --> 56:43.420
If you like,
I could tighten the lugs up for you.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.252
If you don't mind.

56:47.252 --> 56:49.756
Well, you can't be too careful.

57:24.168 --> 57:26.672
-All done.
-Thank you.

57:26.672 --> 57:28.924
No problem. Have a good night.

57:33.882 --> 57:35.210
It's okay.

58:29.504 --> 58:31.168
Are you okay?

58:32.672 --> 58:35.336
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

58:36.168 --> 58:38.714
Must have been worse than I thought.

58:38.714 --> 58:41.588
I can give you a lift to a service station.

58:43.798 --> 58:44.924
Okay.

58:51.252 --> 58:53.294
It's okay. Come on.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.168
I didn't know you had a baby.

59:04.882 --> 59:06.546
Oh, is that okay?

59:08.084 --> 59:09.924
The more the merrier.

59:19.420 --> 59:22.084
You shouldn't smoke. It's a bad habit.

59:28.546 --> 59:32.210
-I think we just passed a filling station.
-It was closed.

59:37.672 --> 59:40.840
Do you always go around
helping people in the night?

59:40.840 --> 59:44.126
When I'm done with them,
they don't need much help.

59:46.966 --> 59:48.840
It's okay.

59:48.840 --> 59:50.924
Before I kill you,

59:50.924 --> 59:53.798
I'm gonna throw your baby
out the window.

1:00:07.294 --> 1:00:10.504
No! Help! Please! No!

1:00:17.378 --> 1:00:20.378
She was on the side of the road.
She flagged me down.

1:00:20.420 --> 1:00:22.126
-What happened to her?
-She said she jumped from a car.

1:00:22.126 --> 1:00:24.084
I found her like this.

1:00:24.084 --> 1:00:27.084
-What is it?
-Please, he said...

1:00:27.084 --> 1:00:30.000
-It'll be okay.
-Tried to kill me.

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:31.630
My baby!

1:00:31.630 --> 1:00:35.126
-Where's her baby?
-She didn't have one when I stopped.

1:00:35.126 --> 1:00:36.798
Where's your baby?

1:00:43.252 --> 1:00:44.504
Jesus.

1:00:52.168 --> 1:00:54.630
-You hid it?
-In case he came back.

1:01:09.504 --> 1:01:10.798

We're really not gonna run
any more of his letters?

1:02:16.252 --> 1:02:18.924
The new policy. Our brothers in blue
want us to hold back

1:02:18.924 --> 1:02:20.588
and see how he reacts.

1:02:20.588 --> 1:02:22.798
Four letters in three months,

1:02:22.798 --> 1:02:25.882
and this is the first mention
of Kathleen Johns. That's very weird.

1:02:25.882 --> 1:02:29.210
That's because he's full of shit.

1:02:30.504 --> 1:02:32.168
What do you mean?

1:02:33.378 --> 1:02:34.588
You don't know?

1:02:36.252 --> 1:02:41.126
Welcome. Please put your stuff down.
You're going down five rows and left.

1:02:41.126 --> 1:02:43.840
Looking for the Modesto Bee
from March.

1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:46.966
I'm going to stand here
and attempt not to vomit.

1:02:46.966 --> 1:02:48.966
-Left.
-Left.

1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.588
-What am I looking for?
-Kathleen Johns.

1:02:52.588 --> 1:02:53.882
Also probably you wanna
pull the Chron from...

1:02:53.882 --> 1:02:57.042
You know, never mind. I'll see to that.

1:02:58.168 --> 1:03:00.672
Okay, look at this letter again.
The part about Kathleen Johns.

1:03:00.672 --> 1:03:02.630
Tell me what facts he gives.

1:03:02.630 --> 1:03:05.840
-A woman and her baby abducted.
-Fact.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.210
-The car on fire.
-Okay, now,

1:03:11.630 --> 1:03:14.084
look at the article from the Bee.

1:03:14.756 --> 1:03:16.420
Seen it yet?

1:03:16.420 --> 1:03:18.420
Everything in the letter
already appeared in the article.

1:03:18.420 --> 1:03:20.378
And he's done it before.

1:03:21.546 --> 1:03:24.294
Officer Richard Radetich,
shot sitting in his car.

1:03:24.294 --> 1:03:26.546
Zodiac claimed that he shot someone
in their car.

1:03:26.546 --> 1:03:30.168
Couple days after this article came out.

1:03:30.168 --> 1:03:31.924
The police already had somebody
in custody.

1:03:31.924 --> 1:03:34.588
Zodiac didn't do it,
but took credit for it anyway

1:03:34.588 --> 1:03:37.000
because he's in it for the press.

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.462
He even stole his symbol.

1:03:38.462 --> 1:03:40.840
-What?
-Yeah. Shit.

1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:42.588
If I show you something,
you promise not to tell anyone?

1:03:42.588 --> 1:03:45.924
-Who would I tell?
-Okay. Totally solid point. Okay.

1:03:53.714 --> 1:03:55.504
That's the only place
that word and that symbol

1:03:55.504 --> 1:03:58.042
ever appeared together
before the letters.

1:03:58.042 --> 1:03:59.672
The guy stole his logo off a watch.

1:03:59.672 --> 1:04:01.084
How can somebody
who's killed 13 people do...

1:04:01.084 --> 1:04:02.420
He claims he's killed 13 people,

1:04:02.420 --> 1:04:04.000
but which ones
can we actually confirm?

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:08.084
There's three in Vallejo,
one in Berryessa, the cabbie. That's it.

1:04:09.714 --> 1:04:12.210
Bobby, you almost look disappointed.

1:04:13.084 --> 1:04:15.588
Chief's pulling everybody off buses.

1:04:16.210 --> 1:04:17.882
Business as usual.

1:04:17.882 --> 1:04:19.630
Something'll shake loose.

1:04:19.630 --> 1:04:21.924
Not a peep in four months.

1:04:21.924 --> 1:04:24.462
First he won't shut up and now...

1:04:24.462 --> 1:04:26.798
Maybe we drove him underground.

1:04:27.420 --> 1:04:29.042
Maybe he's gone.

1:04:30.084 --> 1:04:33.210
<i>311 at 582 Haight, cross at Biltmore.</i>
<i>There's a male...</i>

1:04:33.210 --> 1:04:35.462
-Happy birthday, Bill.
-Thanks.

1:04:45.672 --> 1:04:48.042
Does it ever bother you
that people call you Shorty?

1:04:48.042 --> 1:04:50.630
Does it bother you
that people call you a retard?

1:04:50.630 --> 1:04:53.546
-Nobody calls me that.
-Right.

1:04:53.546 --> 1:04:57.210
<i>As governor,</i>
<i>I pledge to use all my influence</i>

1:04:57.210 --> 1:05:01.966

1:05:01.966 --> 1:05:06.630
<i>I believe some clues were overlooked</i>
<i>in the murder of Darlene Ferrin.</i>

1:05:06.630 --> 1:05:08.546
<i>-I believe her murder was premeditated.</i>
-Who is that?

1:05:08.546 --> 1:05:11.672
Florence Douglas, mayor of Vallejo.
She's running for governor.

1:05:11.672 --> 1:05:14.588
<i>I believe that the police department</i>
<i>either did not have the money, the time</i>

1:05:14.588 --> 1:05:16.714
<i>or, yes, the inclination...</i>

1:05:16.714 --> 1:05:20.210
Sayonara, police endorsement.
Good work, Flo.

1:05:20.210 --> 1:05:22.840
Does anyone ever call me names, or...

1:05:23.924 --> 1:05:25.882
You mean like retard?

1:05:25.882 --> 1:05:27.126
Yeah.

1:05:28.084 --> 1:05:29.168
No.

1:05:33.462 --> 1:05:37.504
Shit. Fuck. Oh, my God. Jesus.

1:05:41.714 --> 1:05:43.672
Tell me that's not a piece
of bloody shirt!

1:05:43.672 --> 1:05:45.294
Fuck! Holy fucking crap!

1:05:45.294 --> 1:05:47.714
"I feel it in my bones,
you ache to know my name

1:05:47.882 --> 1:05:50.336
"and so I'll clue you in.

1:05:50.336 --> 1:05:53.462
"But then, why spoil the game?
Happy Halloween."

1:05:54.924 --> 1:05:58.798
Paul, you did call him
a latent homosexual

1:05:58.798 --> 1:06:00.210
in at least one of your articles.

1:06:00.210 --> 1:06:02.714
Dave. I want a gun.

1:06:05.420 --> 1:06:06.756
A gun?

1:06:11.336 --> 1:06:13.000
You're in Herb Caen.

1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:15.630
"Paul Avery's investigation
has won him the accolade

1:06:15.630 --> 1:06:18.714

1:06:24.336 --> 1:06:26.546
You should sell these.
You could do well.

1:06:26.546 --> 1:06:29.294
It's been a windfall, since
they published the threat on my life.

1:06:29.294 --> 1:06:31.084
I got the leads
coming out of the woodwork.

1:06:31.084 --> 1:06:34.084
There's one guy down in Riverside.

1:06:34.084 --> 1:06:35.336
I'm gonna drive down
and see him tonight.

1:06:35.336 --> 1:06:39.084
-You wanna tag along?
-No, I have a date.

1:06:39.714 --> 1:06:42.126
-Really?
-Who is this guy?

1:06:42.126 --> 1:06:45.798
He wishes to remain anonymous.
I wish to remain infamous.

1:06:45.798 --> 1:06:50.126
So we're going to get along great.

1:06:56.882 --> 1:06:59.588
Hi. Good evening. Hi.
I'm looking for a Melanie.

1:06:59.588 --> 1:07:01.546
Yes.
It's the young lady sitting by herself.

1:07:01.588 --> 1:07:02.924
Thank you.

1:07:09.294 --> 1:07:10.672
You must be Melanie.

1:07:10.672 --> 1:07:12.672
-Which would make you Robert.
-It would.

1:07:12.672 --> 1:07:15.966
Glynnis told me lots about you.

1:07:15.966 --> 1:07:17.798
-And you have wine, great.
-I do.

1:07:17.798 --> 1:07:19.714
Great. How late am I?

1:07:21.588 --> 1:07:24.210
Just a few minutes, really.
I just got here myself.

1:07:24.210 --> 1:07:27.378
Traffic's bumper to bumper.
I was at the gun range.

1:07:27.378 --> 1:07:30.546
-Glynnis said you were a cartoonist.
-Oh, yeah.

1:07:30.546 --> 1:07:32.504
Well, what're you doing at a gun range?

1:07:32.504 --> 1:07:34.168
Reading.

1:07:34.168 --> 1:07:37.084
Get some more...
You need some more napkins.

1:07:38.378 --> 1:07:40.672
So, you work with Glynnis.

1:07:40.672 --> 1:07:42.714
-For her, actually.
-For her?

1:07:42.714 --> 1:07:44.378
Oh, well...

1:07:46.210 --> 1:07:48.378
My children are terrified of Glynnis.

1:07:48.378 --> 1:07:49.672
Me, too.

1:07:53.042 --> 1:07:54.294
So, the gun range?

1:07:54.294 --> 1:07:57.336
We're... I'm working on...
Do you know the Zodiac?

1:07:57.336 --> 1:07:58.756
-Yeah.
-I'm working with...

1:07:58.756 --> 1:08:01.336
-Do you know who Paul Avery is?
-Sounds kind of familiar.

1:08:01.336 --> 1:08:03.168
He's the writer
that the Zodiac threatened.

1:08:03.168 --> 1:08:04.462
Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV.

1:08:04.462 --> 1:08:07.714
Well, I work near him
and he's going down tonight

1:08:07.714 --> 1:08:10.882
to track an anonymous tipster
down in Riverside.

1:08:12.042 --> 1:08:14.210
Where is Riverside?

1:08:14.210 --> 1:08:15.756
It's near L.A.

1:08:15.798 --> 1:08:19.420
Oh, wow. I don't think Paul knows
that it's that far away.

1:08:21.588 --> 1:08:23.588
Sounds kind of dangerous.

1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:27.840
Yeah. How do you mean?

1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:30.336
Well, you said it was
an anonymous tip, right?

1:08:30.336 --> 1:08:31.882
Yeah.

1:08:31.882 --> 1:08:35.462
So it could be an ambush.
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.

1:08:36.966 --> 1:08:39.462
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

1:08:39.462 --> 1:08:42.126
Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun.

1:08:45.924 --> 1:08:48.420
So, do you know what's good here?

1:08:50.252 --> 1:08:52.420
I've never been here before.

1:08:54.504 --> 1:08:56.504
The pasta, spaghetti?

1:08:58.210 --> 1:09:00.294
Are you ready to order yet?

1:09:01.336 --> 1:09:04.252
Yeah, I'll have the penne vodka.
But could you do it in a cream sauce?

1:09:04.252 --> 1:09:05.588
Of course.

1:09:10.546 --> 1:09:12.756
Maybe give us another minute?

1:09:14.588 --> 1:09:16.630
Do you have any change?

1:09:16.630 --> 1:09:18.924
Oh, wait, no wait, hold on.

1:09:18.924 --> 1:09:20.546
Nope. That's a penny.

1:09:20.546 --> 1:09:22.042
Do you have to make a phone call?

1:09:22.042 --> 1:09:25.546
Yeah, you know,
when you were saying that the Zodiac...

1:09:26.126 --> 1:09:27.882
You know, when you said it
was dangerous, I just thought

1:09:27.882 --> 1:09:30.000
-that it is dangerous, and it's...
-Stupid?

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.714
Stupid. And I just thought that

1:09:31.714 --> 1:09:35.504
I should call his wife
and just see if she's heard from him.

1:09:37.798 --> 1:09:39.252
I have some change.

1:09:58.462 --> 1:10:01.798
Okay. Well, she said
she'd call when she heard from him.

1:10:01.798 --> 1:10:03.294
-Good.
-Yeah.

1:10:04.672 --> 1:10:08.126
Melanie, I should really go home
and wait for the call.

1:10:11.210 --> 1:10:14.714
Is this some sleazy plan
to get me to go home with you?

1:10:15.378 --> 1:10:16.882
What? No.

1:10:19.378 --> 1:10:21.336
I'll get the food to go.

1:10:23.042 --> 1:10:24.210
Hello!

1:10:40.378 --> 1:10:43.210
Hi! I'm supposed
to meet somebody here.

1:11:01.420 --> 1:11:02.882
Anything?

1:11:06.462 --> 1:11:07.840
You don't have to stay.

1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:09.378
Are you kidding?

1:11:09.378 --> 1:11:12.504
This is the most interesting date
I've ever had.

1:11:16.756 --> 1:11:17.966
<i>-Paul?</i>
-Robert?

1:11:17.966 --> 1:11:19.630
-Yes.
-You sitting down?

1:11:19.630 --> 1:11:20.840
<i>Yes.</i>

1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:22.714
You're not gonna believe this.

1:11:22.714 --> 1:11:23.840
Dave!

1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:26.546
<i>In a bizarre twist,</i>
<i>the hunted has become hunter.</i>

1:11:26.546 --> 1:11:30.420
San Francisco Chronicle reporter
<i>and Zodiac target Paul Avery</i>

1:11:30.420 --> 1:11:32.588
<i>claims to have uncovered</i>
<i>new information</i>

1:11:32.588 --> 1:11:37.126
<i>regarding the only unsolved homicide</i>
<i>in Riverside County's history,</i>

1:11:37.126 --> 1:11:40.420
<i>a 1966 Southern California murder,</i>

1:11:40.420 --> 1:11:43.462
<i>that Avery now believes</i>

1:11:43.462 --> 1:11:44.588
What?

1:11:44.588 --> 1:11:45.840
-He didn't call you about this?
-Hang on!

1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:47.462
<i>The Riverside killer</i>
<i>wrote to the press letters</i>

1:11:47.462 --> 1:11:51.378
<i>that I then took personally to</i>
<i>the Office of Questioned Documents.</i>

1:11:51.378 --> 1:11:53.672
<i>And what did this expert tell you?</i>

1:11:53.672 --> 1:11:55.294
<i>What I knew in my gut, Ron.</i>

1:11:55.294 --> 1:11:57.840
<i>The handwriting matches Zodiac's.</i>

1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:00.252
How'd he get the evidence
out of Riverside?

1:12:00.252 --> 1:12:02.588
He took it to Sherwood
without telling us, the son of a bitch.

1:12:02.588 --> 1:12:03.882
You know how bad this looks?

1:12:03.882 --> 1:12:06.168
Hey, how do we know
that this lead is real?

1:12:06.168 --> 1:12:08.546
It's very real. You know how I know?

1:12:08.546 --> 1:12:10.420
Because I saw it on TV.

1:12:16.462 --> 1:12:17.504
Excuse me.

1:12:17.504 --> 1:12:18.672
Dave.

1:12:19.042 --> 1:12:20.252
Hi.

1:12:20.252 --> 1:12:22.504
Dave, you know Mel Nicolai.
He's working the case for Justice.

1:12:22.504 --> 1:12:23.756
Good to see you, Mel.

1:12:23.756 --> 1:12:25.714
All due respect,
can someone explain to me

1:12:25.714 --> 1:12:27.462
why I'm reading
about breaks in this case

1:12:27.462 --> 1:12:29.378
in the Chronicle instead
of getting calls from you?

1:12:29.378 --> 1:12:30.546
We got screwed.

1:12:30.546 --> 1:12:31.840
Dave, come on.

1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:33.882
You do get your name in the paper a lot.
People talk.

1:12:33.882 --> 1:12:36.882
I don't ever talk about an open
investigation, period. Okay, Ken?

1:12:36.882 --> 1:12:39.756
Dave? Hey. Hi.

1:12:39.756 --> 1:12:42.420
Paul Avery. Can I catch a ride
with you gents when we get there?

1:12:42.420 --> 1:12:44.252
Not a good idea, Paul.

1:12:45.126 --> 1:12:48.126
He's gonna make me take a cab
when we're going to the same place.

1:12:48.126 --> 1:12:50.798
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>thank you for choosing PSA.</i>

1:12:50.798 --> 1:12:53.000
-Fair enough. Fair enough.
<i>-Please take your seats at this time.</i>

1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.210
<i>Remember, smoking is</i>
<i>in the last six aisles only.</i>

1:12:56.210 --> 1:12:57.882
<i>Enjoy your flight.</i>

1:13:01.714 --> 1:13:03.882
-Cross? Hi.
-Yeah.

1:13:03.882 --> 1:13:06.252
-Detective David Toschi, SFPD.
-How are you doing?

1:13:06.252 --> 1:13:07.882
Great. Thanks for having us
down today.

1:13:07.882 --> 1:13:10.462
Not at all.
I hear you have some files for us.

1:13:10.462 --> 1:13:12.084
I'll show you mine. You show me yours.

1:13:12.084 --> 1:13:14.462
-Frisco huh?
-That's right. San Francisco.

1:13:15.084 --> 1:13:16.630
-Ken Narlow from Napa.
-Ken.

1:13:16.630 --> 1:13:18.462
-Mel Nicolai, Justice.
-Mel.

1:13:18.462 --> 1:13:19.504
Here's what we know.

1:13:19.504 --> 1:13:22.168
Cheri Jo Bates attended
Riverside Community College.

1:13:22.168 --> 1:13:26.588
She studies in the library
the night of October 30th, 1966.

1:13:26.588 --> 1:13:30.504
She leaves with an unidentified male
at closing, 9:00 p.m.

1:13:30.504 --> 1:13:34.294
Her body's found the next morning
in a parking lot, stabbed to death.

1:13:34.294 --> 1:13:35.714
Her car is disabled.

1:13:35.714 --> 1:13:38.756
Someone cut the coil in the distributor,
the battery died.

1:13:38.756 --> 1:13:41.252
The someone comes back,
offers to help.

1:13:41.252 --> 1:13:43.504
-Like Kathleen Johns.
-Who?

1:13:43.504 --> 1:13:46.252
A woman outside of Modesto,
might be a Zodiac victim.

1:13:46.252 --> 1:13:49.882
Might. Might be.
I have her comp right here in this file.

1:13:49.882 --> 1:13:51.168
Okay.

1:13:51.168 --> 1:13:54.378
A typewritten confession was sent
<i>to the Riverside Press Enterprise</i>

1:13:54.378 --> 1:13:57.252
on November 29th,
a month after Bates's murder.

1:13:57.252 --> 1:13:58.672
They ran it.

1:14:00.924 --> 1:14:03.714
"I'm not sick. I am insane.
But that will not stop the game.

1:14:03.714 --> 1:14:06.000
"This letter should be published
for all to read."

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.420
He wants to be published.
He calls it a game.

1:14:07.420 --> 1:14:08.882
I mean, this could be our boy.

1:14:08.882 --> 1:14:12.294
Six months later, the police,
the girl's father, and the paper,

1:14:12.294 --> 1:14:14.252
they all received these.

1:14:19.084 --> 1:14:20.924
Double postage, just like Zodiac.

1:14:22.462 --> 1:14:25.462
These are what Sherwood Morrill
matched the Zodiac letters?

1:14:25.462 --> 1:14:27.588
These and the desktop. Don.

1:14:27.588 --> 1:14:31.924
This was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in RCC storage.

1:14:40.882 --> 1:14:43.504
Sherwood got
a handwriting match off wood?

1:14:45.378 --> 1:14:47.756
Who etches in their own handwriting?

1:14:47.756 --> 1:14:49.000
To be honest with you,

1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.462
our letters and your letters,
I don't see it.

1:14:51.462 --> 1:14:54.126
How did Paul Avery
get his hands on the exemplars?

1:14:54.126 --> 1:14:55.588
I gave them to him.

1:14:55.588 --> 1:14:57.546
We talked on the phone the other day
for about an hour.

1:14:57.546 --> 1:14:59.126
And I told him you were gonna be here.

1:14:59.126 --> 1:15:00.882
-You told him we were meeting?
-Yeah.

1:15:00.882 --> 1:15:03.168
I also told him
we don't think this is Zodiac.

1:15:03.168 --> 1:15:05.336
Okay, wait a minute.

1:15:05.336 --> 1:15:08.504
-You don't think this is Zodiac?
-We got a guy we like for it.

1:15:08.504 --> 1:15:10.168
We don't have enough
to pin it on him yet,

1:15:10.168 --> 1:15:11.504
but we're pretty sure it's him.

1:15:11.504 --> 1:15:14.504
If you don't think this is Zodiac,
then why give anything to Avery?

1:15:14.504 --> 1:15:16.210
I'm trying to cooperate.

1:15:16.210 --> 1:15:19.126
Oh, that's how you cooperate?
By giving information to reporters?

1:15:19.126 --> 1:15:20.756
Look, I don't know
about the handwriting,

1:15:20.756 --> 1:15:22.084
but Sherwood says it's a match, right?

1:15:22.084 --> 1:15:24.588
So, let's just say
that your guy did Cheri Jo.

1:15:24.588 --> 1:15:25.840
He types the confession.

1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:29.084
Zodiac reads it in the paper,
and he writes a letter taking credit for it.

1:15:29.084 --> 1:15:30.714
Now, that's something he's done before.

1:15:30.714 --> 1:15:33.420
Look, now you have everything we have.

1:15:33.420 --> 1:15:36.798
But, in my opinion,
you guys came south for nothing.

1:15:36.798 --> 1:15:39.000
FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR.

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.840
I don't care what he says.
This still could be Z.

1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:45.168
The problem is
the entire state already thinks it is.

1:15:45.168 --> 1:15:48.546
Well, there's your press agent.
Talk to him about it.

1:15:51.042 --> 1:15:53.042
I come in peace.
I don't want any trouble.

1:15:53.042 --> 1:15:55.126
I really don't want to talk to you
right now, Paul. Not now.

1:15:55.126 --> 1:15:59.168
-Just trying to do my job.
-Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.

1:15:59.168 --> 1:16:01.294
We're already screwed with
the amount of tips we got on this thing,

1:16:01.294 --> 1:16:03.084
and you just freaked out the entire state.

1:16:03.126 --> 1:16:06.504
I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ
looking at me sideways

1:16:06.504 --> 1:16:09.420
and Riverside's telling me
I'm on a snipe hunt!

1:16:09.420 --> 1:16:12.168
Jesus. Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift.
I gave that to you.

1:16:12.168 --> 1:16:13.840
You and Armstrong
never would have found her.

1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:16.168
This may not be Zodiac.
Does that matter to you?

1:16:16.168 --> 1:16:17.630
-What if it is?
-Does it matter that Riverside may not

1:16:17.630 --> 1:16:19.798
be able to make a case
against their suspect because of you?

1:16:19.798 --> 1:16:21.798
Tell it to Sherwood.
I'm out here, beating the bushes,

1:16:21.798 --> 1:16:23.462
trying to draw him out.
We're in this together.

1:16:23.462 --> 1:16:24.924
No, we're not in anything together, Paul,

1:16:24.924 --> 1:16:26.882
because I'm not interested
in upping my circulation.

1:16:26.882 --> 1:16:29.882
Oh, boy. He wrote me.
He threatened my life.

1:16:29.882 --> 1:16:31.588
Hey, Bullitt!

1:16:31.588 --> 1:16:35.546
Been a year-and-a-half,
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?

1:16:37.672 --> 1:16:40.126
-Go fuck yourself.
-Happily.

1:16:40.126 --> 1:16:42.168
You should have called me, Paul.

1:16:47.714 --> 1:16:48.966
Thank you.

1:17:02.210 --> 1:17:04.042
-Did you see this?
-Unfortunately, yes.

1:17:04.042 --> 1:17:06.714
Here comes every lunatic in California.

1:17:07.588 --> 1:17:08.966
I'm the Zodiac.

1:17:08.966 --> 1:17:10.630
And how did you kill your victims?

1:17:10.630 --> 1:17:13.378
With a gun. No, with a hammer.

1:17:13.378 --> 1:17:14.798
All I'm authorized to tell you

1:17:14.798 --> 1:17:16.462
is that he's still under
government employment.

1:17:16.462 --> 1:17:19.630
-And who authorized you to tell me this?
-That's all I'm authorized to say.

1:17:19.630 --> 1:17:21.840
<i>Only a little rat bastard like Andre</i>

1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:24.504
could have done something
like cut off all the victims' hands.

1:17:24.504 --> 1:17:27.000
Zodiac didn't cut off
any of the victims' hands.

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:28.840
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:31.462
Travis and I worked here
side by side for 10 years.

1:17:31.462 --> 1:17:35.630
His foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin.

1:17:35.630 --> 1:17:37.252
-Coincidence?
-I don't know.

1:17:37.252 --> 1:17:39.126
You're a cop, man. Do the math.

1:17:43.504 --> 1:17:46.840
Have you considered
the killer might be Paul Avery?

1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:48.042
Frequently.

1:17:48.630 --> 1:17:50.000
He was drinking Coors,
getting a load on.

1:17:50.546 --> 1:17:54.294
Starts talking about hunting people.
Like that book.

1:17:54.294 --> 1:17:56.546
Says how you can put a light
at the end of a gun

1:17:56.546 --> 1:17:58.168
to use as a sight in the dark.

1:17:58.168 --> 1:18:00.042
-He said that?
-Yeah.

1:18:00.042 --> 1:18:02.966
So I asked him,
"How would you get away with it?"

1:18:03.210 --> 1:18:05.042
And he said, "It would be easy

1:18:05.042 --> 1:18:07.546
"'cause there'd be no real motive
to the thing."

1:18:07.546 --> 1:18:09.546
Then he said he'd write letters
to the police

1:18:09.546 --> 1:18:11.420
and call himself Zodiac
to mess with them.

1:18:11.420 --> 1:18:13.126
Leigh liked messing with people.

1:18:13.126 --> 1:18:16.252
-You're positive he said "Zodiac"?
-Yeah.

1:18:16.252 --> 1:18:19.462
I thought it was a stupid name.
So I told him.

1:18:19.462 --> 1:18:22.966
He got up all upset and said,
"I don't care what you think.

1:18:22.966 --> 1:18:25.714
"I've thought about it a long time
and that's the name I'm gonna use."

1:18:25.714 --> 1:18:29.168
Did you feel like he'd been
thinking about it a long time?

1:18:29.168 --> 1:18:32.504
He was raw about losing his job
at the school.

1:18:32.504 --> 1:18:35.588
He talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus

1:18:35.588 --> 1:18:38.084
and picking off the little darlings.

1:18:38.084 --> 1:18:42.252
-He actually used those words?
-That's what made me remember.

1:18:42.252 --> 1:18:44.798
Afterwards, I told my wife
I didn't wanna see him again.

1:18:44.798 --> 1:18:46.630
And I haven't since.

1:18:46.630 --> 1:18:49.252
Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.

1:18:49.252 --> 1:18:51.420
I know he's been up to that lake
a bunch of times.

1:18:51.420 --> 1:18:53.882
Lake Berryessa?
Did you ever go with him?

1:18:53.882 --> 1:18:57.966
Couple times. We went fishing
by Putah Creek near there.

1:18:57.966 --> 1:18:59.504
Tell him when you put it together.

1:18:59.504 --> 1:19:04.336
About a year ago, in the paper,
there was a story about the Zodiac.

1:19:04.336 --> 1:19:07.546
And it all comes back.
I tried to call the local cops.

1:19:07.546 --> 1:19:09.210
They blew him off.
Thought he was a nut.

1:19:09.210 --> 1:19:13.126
And you're sure
the conversation you had about Zodiac

1:19:13.126 --> 1:19:17.000
took place on January 1st, 1968?

1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:18.840
It couldn't have been any later.

1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:21.756
I started a new job in L.A.
on January 20th.

1:19:22.252 --> 1:19:23.840
I had to move.

1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:26.420
<i>-This is my problem. This guy...</i>
<i>-Arthur Leigh Allen?</i>

1:19:26.420 --> 1:19:29.126
This guy, Leigh,
just lays out his entire evil plan

1:19:29.126 --> 1:19:30.714
to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1:19:30.714 --> 1:19:33.630
I don't know.
He's angry, he's been drinking,

1:19:33.630 --> 1:19:35.840
been thinking about it for a while.
I can buy that.

1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:38.294
So why didn't Cheney
contact us sooner?

1:19:38.294 --> 1:19:39.840
I checked. He did.

1:19:39.840 --> 1:19:42.924
First recorded contact
with the police department about Allen

1:19:42.924 --> 1:19:45.840
was in Pomona. January 10th, 1970.

1:19:45.840 --> 1:19:47.042
He just got lost in the shuffle.

1:19:47.042 --> 1:19:48.798
Did Cheney have anything
against Allen?

1:19:48.798 --> 1:19:50.210
Did Allen screw his wife or anything?

1:19:50.210 --> 1:19:52.000
We're gonna do
a full background check.

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.714
But I got to tell you, I like this guy.

1:19:55.714 --> 1:19:57.630
So, let's pull
some handwriting samples.

1:19:59.336 --> 1:20:02.336
Hi. I talked to Sherwood.
He got the samples.

1:20:02.336 --> 1:20:04.294
-What are you having?
-BLT.

1:20:06.924 --> 1:20:09.546
So, the check stubs are a wash.
There's not enough handwriting.

1:20:09.546 --> 1:20:12.168
The application's got more,
but it doesn't look like Z's,

1:20:12.168 --> 1:20:14.588
so he can't rule him in.
But he can't rule him out, either.

1:20:14.588 --> 1:20:17.504
-Well, that's vague.
-He needs more samples.

1:20:18.546 --> 1:20:20.672
Also, our guy is a pervert.

1:20:21.714 --> 1:20:23.672
When Mel got the application
from Valley Springs,

1:20:23.672 --> 1:20:26.042
they told him that
Allen had been fired for touching kids.

1:20:26.042 --> 1:20:28.210
-Touching?
-Polite euphemism.

1:20:29.840 --> 1:20:33.084
-So what do you want to do?
-Make some phone calls.

1:20:33.084 --> 1:20:35.798
-Are you done with the fries?
-Go ahead.

1:20:35.798 --> 1:20:37.336
<i>Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance</i>

1:20:37.336 --> 1:20:39.672
<i>to look at the copies</i>
<i>of the Zodiac letters we sent you?</i>

1:20:39.672 --> 1:20:42.462
Yeah.
Some of this stuff is pretty creepy.

1:20:42.462 --> 1:20:45.588
<i>-Yeah, we know that.</i>
-I mean, creepy like Leigh.

1:20:45.924 --> 1:20:48.546
He misspells words like that.
He thinks it's funny.

1:20:48.546 --> 1:20:50.420
What about the handwriting?

1:20:50.420 --> 1:20:53.462
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Don't you have experts for that stuff?</i>

1:20:53.462 --> 1:20:56.672
Our man at Questioned Documents
says it's inconclusive.

1:20:56.672 --> 1:20:58.588
Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1:20:58.588 --> 1:20:59.966
<i>The letters are a little too neat</i>

1:20:59.966 --> 1:21:02.462
<i>for someone to have written</i>
<i>with the wrong hand.</i>

1:21:02.462 --> 1:21:04.294
But not for Leigh, right.

1:21:04.294 --> 1:21:06.294
-What do you mean?
<i>-He's ambidextrous.</i>

1:21:06.294 --> 1:21:09.798
<i>He can write with either hand.</i>
<i>Didn't you guys know that?</i>

1:21:09.798 --> 1:21:12.714
In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.

1:21:12.714 --> 1:21:15.252
Job applications,
letters to friends, et cetera.

1:21:15.252 --> 1:21:18.000
But he writes the Zodiac letters
with his right hand

1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:21.798
producing a different handwriting
that he can't be linked to.

1:21:22.210 --> 1:21:23.672
We got to see this guy, Chief.

1:21:23.672 --> 1:21:24.966
-Where is he?
-Vallejo.

1:21:24.966 --> 1:21:28.126
He works at Union Oil in Pinole.
His brother's up there, too.

1:21:28.126 --> 1:21:29.672
See them both.

1:21:29.672 --> 1:21:32.252
Make sure you call Mulanax.
It is his backyard.

1:21:32.252 --> 1:21:35.504
Oh, right, because that
worked so well for us in Riverside.

1:21:35.504 --> 1:21:38.084
Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.

1:21:47.672 --> 1:21:51.756
You can talk to him in here.
Coke machine's busted, by the way.

1:21:52.882 --> 1:21:54.882
I'll go get him for you.

1:21:56.336 --> 1:21:58.546
So how do you guys wanna do this?

1:21:58.546 --> 1:22:02.294
Well, Bill talked to the informants.
He leads, we follow?

1:22:02.294 --> 1:22:03.924
It's okay by me.

1:22:17.798 --> 1:22:20.504
Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.

1:22:20.504 --> 1:22:23.504
This is Inspector Dave Toschi
and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.

1:22:23.504 --> 1:22:27.966
We're investigating the Zodiac murders
in San Francisco and Vallejo.

1:22:27.966 --> 1:22:29.588
Please, sit down.

1:22:38.420 --> 1:22:41.000
The informant notified us
that you made certain statements

1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:43.672
11 months prior
to the first Zodiac murder.

1:22:43.672 --> 1:22:46.798
If they're true,
they're quite incriminating.

1:22:46.798 --> 1:22:49.126
Do you recall
having any such conversation?

1:22:49.126 --> 1:22:50.336
-No.
-Have you ever read

1:22:50.336 --> 1:22:52.420
or heard anything about the Zodiac?

1:22:52.420 --> 1:22:53.756
When it was first in the paper.

1:22:53.756 --> 1:22:55.924
But I didn't follow it
after those first reports.

1:22:55.924 --> 1:22:58.462
-Why not?
-Too morbid. I...

1:22:59.420 --> 1:23:02.336
I told all this to the other officer.

1:23:02.336 --> 1:23:04.840
-Which other officer?
-From Vallejo.

1:23:06.210 --> 1:23:07.756
Do you remember his name?

1:23:07.756 --> 1:23:11.588
No, but it was right after
the murder at the lake.

1:23:11.588 --> 1:23:14.042
And what did you tell this officer?

1:23:15.630 --> 1:23:19.966
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point
that weekend to skin dive.

1:23:19.966 --> 1:23:22.798
That I was alone
but I met a couple there.

1:23:23.966 --> 1:23:26.168
I have their names at home
if you want them.

1:23:26.168 --> 1:23:27.924
That would be great, Arthur.

1:23:27.924 --> 1:23:29.840
-Leigh.
-What?

1:23:30.672 --> 1:23:33.210
Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.

1:23:34.966 --> 1:23:38.462
Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me.

1:23:38.462 --> 1:23:42.336
It was around 4:00.
But I forgot to tell the other officer that.

1:23:42.336 --> 1:23:44.546
-Neighbor's name?
-Bill White.

1:23:46.336 --> 1:23:48.210
He died a week or so afterwards.

1:23:48.210 --> 1:23:51.630
Heart attack.
So I didn't think to call to follow up.

1:23:53.798 --> 1:23:55.966
The knives I had in my car
with the blood on them,

1:23:55.966 --> 1:23:59.546
that blood came from a chicken
that I killed for dinner.

1:24:02.336 --> 1:24:05.210
-What?
-I had knives in my car that weekend.

1:24:05.210 --> 1:24:09.504
Maybe Bill saw them
and called the other officer on me.

1:24:10.126 --> 1:24:13.294
Well, we'll be checking in on that.

1:24:13.294 --> 1:24:14.840
Well, let me ask you something else.

1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:18.798
Were you ever in Southern California
at any time in 1966?

1:24:19.798 --> 1:24:22.336
-Is this about the Riverside killing?
-Yes.

1:24:23.420 --> 1:24:25.798
Well, I guess I was there
around that time.

1:24:25.798 --> 1:24:29.126
I used to go down there a lot.
I like the auto races.

1:24:33.462 --> 1:24:36.000
Informant says that
you're ambidextrous?

1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000
No, that's untrue.

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.336
You can't write with both hands?

1:24:41.504 --> 1:24:44.672
My teachers tried to make me
when I was a kid, but I couldn't.

1:24:44.672 --> 1:24:46.882
I'm left-handed.

1:24:46.882 --> 1:24:51.042
He also said that you made statements
about killing school children.

1:24:51.756 --> 1:24:53.336
That is...

1:24:53.336 --> 1:24:56.714
That is horrible. That is...
That's a horrible thing to say.

1:24:56.714 --> 1:25:00.000
So, you weren't angry
about being fired from Valley Springs

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.252
for touching your students?

1:25:11.504 --> 1:25:13.210
I'm not the Zodiac.

1:25:14.168 --> 1:25:17.168
And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.

1:25:19.378 --> 1:25:21.210
That's a nice watch.

1:25:23.042 --> 1:25:24.168
Thank you.

1:25:24.168 --> 1:25:25.336
May I see it?

1:25:25.336 --> 1:25:25.630
May I see it?

1:25:27.546 --> 1:25:29.000
May I see it?

1:25:40.840 --> 1:25:41.924
Where'd you get it?

1:25:42.084 --> 1:25:44.924
It was Christmas gift
from my mother two years ago.

1:25:44.924 --> 1:25:47.168
That's very sweet.

1:25:47.168 --> 1:25:49.882
So, tell me something, Arthur.

1:25:49.882 --> 1:25:51.000
You don't remember anyone

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:54.882
you might have had a conversation with
regarding the Zodiac?

1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:01.420
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker
at Vallejo Recreation.

1:26:02.714 --> 1:26:04.630
But I couldn't be positive.

1:26:04.630 --> 1:26:06.798
I used to work there when...

1:26:10.462 --> 1:26:12.546
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:15.000
What?

1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:18.294
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>
That's why you're here, isn't it?

1:26:18.294 --> 1:26:20.126
It was my favorite book in high school.

1:26:20.126 --> 1:26:23.714
It's about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on this island.

1:26:23.714 --> 1:26:25.210
Because he was
tired of hunting animals,

1:26:25.210 --> 1:26:26.882
he hunted the people for the challenge.

1:26:26.882 --> 1:26:31.126
And man is the most
dangerous animal of all?

1:26:31.126 --> 1:26:33.672
That's the whole point of the story.

1:26:34.336 --> 1:26:35.714
Great book.

1:26:36.924 --> 1:26:39.588
Or, at least, that's what I told Phil.

1:26:45.168 --> 1:26:46.420
May I go?

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:51.126
Sure.

1:26:55.966 --> 1:27:00.336
-Thanks for your time.
-I'm willing to help in any way possible.

1:27:00.336 --> 1:27:02.504
I look forward to the day

1:27:02.504 --> 1:27:06.000
when police officers
are no longer referred to as pigs.

1:27:06.966 --> 1:27:08.168
Thanks.

1:27:09.252 --> 1:27:10.924
We'll be in touch.

1:27:22.672 --> 1:27:26.882
So does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation?

1:27:26.882 --> 1:27:29.882
These are copies of some
of the Zodiac letters that were sent.

1:27:30.378 --> 1:27:33.798
We'd like you to take a look at them.

1:27:33.798 --> 1:27:35.756
You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1:27:35.756 --> 1:27:37.840
Well, we're looking at him.

1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:39.294
Are you going to arrest him?

1:27:39.294 --> 1:27:43.336
Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people
just because we're interested in them.

1:27:43.336 --> 1:27:44.882
Well, Leigh's always been troubled.

1:27:44.882 --> 1:27:47.084
Is it true about the children?

1:27:47.630 --> 1:27:49.168
Unfortunately.

1:27:49.168 --> 1:27:51.882
We don't see him much anymore
since we found out.

1:27:51.882 --> 1:27:54.000
What are your feelings
about Don Cheney?

1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.420
Don Cheney? My old roommate?

1:27:56.420 --> 1:27:59.504
-Was he the one who contacted you?
-That's confidential.

1:27:59.504 --> 1:28:01.126
Well, Don's a very reliable guy.

1:28:01.126 --> 1:28:04.294
If he were to tell you something,
I'd believe it to be true.

1:28:04.294 --> 1:28:05.546
-This one.
-What about it?

1:28:05.546 --> 1:28:07.798
Here, where he spells
"Christmas" with two "S's."

1:28:07.798 --> 1:28:09.840
We got a Christmas card from Leigh
a couple years ago.

1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:12.966
He spelled it the exact same way.
Christ-mass.

1:28:12.966 --> 1:28:15.798
-Would you still have that?
-I can look for it.

1:28:15.798 --> 1:28:17.924
Thank you. That'd be great.

1:28:19.042 --> 1:28:21.168
Is there anything else
we can do to help?

1:28:21.168 --> 1:28:22.924
<i>The brother said</i>
<i>he would search Leigh's apartment</i>

1:28:22.924 --> 1:28:24.252
next time he went out of town.

1:28:24.252 --> 1:28:26.588
-That gets you around a warrant.
-For the time being.

1:28:26.588 --> 1:28:29.924
If we do find something,
Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo,

1:28:29.924 --> 1:28:31.756
and we could search the place properly.

1:28:31.756 --> 1:28:33.336
Now I got a chance to talk to the cop

1:28:33.336 --> 1:28:36.294
who interviewed Leigh Allen
two days after the Berryessa murders.

1:28:36.294 --> 1:28:38.084
Doesn't remember how he got onto him,

1:28:38.084 --> 1:28:41.210
but didn't think he looked like a killer
so he didn't like him for Z.

1:28:41.210 --> 1:28:44.126
-But you do?
-I wish I could've taken the guy in there.

1:28:44.126 --> 1:28:47.168
Take it slow, Dave.
Try and find more stuff for Sherwood.

1:28:47.168 --> 1:28:49.294
A match'll get us farther
on the warrants.

1:28:49.294 --> 1:28:52.504
-Avery's on two.
-Tell him to screw.

1:28:52.504 --> 1:28:56.840
You want me to communicate that
verbatim or can I spice it up a little?

1:29:06.630 --> 1:29:08.084
Christ, kid.

1:29:09.714 --> 1:29:10.756
Yeah.

1:29:10.756 --> 1:29:13.168
-Paul, I've been thinking...
-Oh, God save us all.

1:29:13.168 --> 1:29:14.630
The letter to Melvin Belli

1:29:14.630 --> 1:29:17.672
was sent exactly one year
after the Lake Herman Road murder.

1:29:17.672 --> 1:29:19.504
And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father

1:29:19.504 --> 1:29:21.966
was sent exactly six months
after her death.

1:29:21.966 --> 1:29:24.378
-She was killed a day before Halloween.
-Yeah.

1:29:24.378 --> 1:29:25.966
And you received a Halloween card...

1:29:25.966 --> 1:29:28.672
You know, these are all fascinating
pieces of news, Robert,

1:29:28.672 --> 1:29:30.714
it's a bit early in the day.

1:29:30.714 --> 1:29:33.588
Paul, it's 11:00 and we missed Editorial.

1:29:38.168 --> 1:29:40.294
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.
-No, no, no.

1:29:40.294 --> 1:29:41.504
-I just thought that...
-No, no, no.

1:29:47.126 --> 1:29:49.504
This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1:29:51.588 --> 1:29:54.210
This sample matches the canceled
checks and the application?

1:29:54.210 --> 1:29:55.294
Perfectly.

1:29:55.294 --> 1:29:58.630
So we've just retested the left hand.
I mean, we know he's ambidextrous.

1:29:58.630 --> 1:30:01.966
In 38 years, I've never seen anyone
that ambidextrous.

1:30:01.966 --> 1:30:04.462
Both hands would have commonalities.

1:30:04.798 --> 1:30:06.126
I'm sorry.

1:30:06.588 --> 1:30:08.336
Just not gonna work.

1:30:10.252 --> 1:30:12.756
<i>-Homicide, Toschi.</i>
-Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.

1:30:12.756 --> 1:30:15.000
Hey. Mulanax. Yeah.

1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:16.504
<i>We struck out with the judge.</i>

1:30:16.504 --> 1:30:18.210
<i>He won't sign off on a warrant</i>
<i>for Allen's house.</i>

1:30:18.210 --> 1:30:20.378
-Why not?
-Said it wasn't enough.

1:30:20.378 --> 1:30:22.798
Now, unless we bring him a handwriting
match or some evidence that...

1:30:22.798 --> 1:30:25.252
How are we gonna get evidence
if we can't toss the house?

1:30:25.252 --> 1:30:26.756
<i>I don't know.</i>

1:30:27.252 --> 1:30:30.210
-I truly am sorry.
<i>-No, no. Thank you, Jack.</i>

1:30:32.084 --> 1:30:33.252
What do you wanna do?

1:30:33.252 --> 1:30:34.672
Don't know what I can do
without Vallejo.

1:30:34.672 --> 1:30:37.630
We need Allen's right hand.
We can't get it without a warrant.

1:30:37.630 --> 1:30:39.798
Are there other guys
you should be looking at?

1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:41.840
Only, what?

1:30:41.840 --> 1:30:43.840
Twenty-three hundred?

1:30:43.840 --> 1:30:45.210
Okay, then.

1:30:48.378 --> 1:30:49.714
Okay, then.

1:31:17.630 --> 1:31:20.378
Paul, you wrote the Justice Department

1:31:20.378 --> 1:31:23.756
asking to be put in charge
of the Zodiac investigation?

1:31:25.756 --> 1:31:27.756
I merely suggested...

1:31:27.756 --> 1:31:29.042
On our letterhead?

1:31:29.084 --> 1:31:31.210
...that those with intimate knowledge
of the case

1:31:31.210 --> 1:31:33.252
create an information clearinghouse

1:31:33.252 --> 1:31:35.462
to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas.

1:31:35.462 --> 1:31:38.588
-And that you run it.
-Well, who better than me?

1:31:39.630 --> 1:31:41.168
The marked man.

1:31:41.882 --> 1:31:43.924
Paul, if you want to work here,
I need three things.

1:31:43.924 --> 1:31:45.462
One, stop boozing.

1:31:45.504 --> 1:31:48.756
Two, stop doing
whatever else it is you're doing.

1:31:48.756 --> 1:31:52.336
And three, cut this nonsense out.

1:31:52.336 --> 1:31:55.546
Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time

1:31:55.546 --> 1:32:00.840
you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag,

1:32:00.840 --> 1:32:02.588
I'll more than happily...

1:32:02.588 --> 1:32:06.168
More than happily
decamp for greener pastures.

1:32:06.168 --> 1:32:07.798
Paul, I mean it!

1:32:17.966 --> 1:32:19.966
-Paul?
-Yep.

1:32:19.966 --> 1:32:23.168
-What was that?
-An editorial tête-à-tête.

1:32:24.336 --> 1:32:26.504
-Wanna grab a drink?
-It's 10:00 in the morning.

1:32:26.504 --> 1:32:28.336
Late breakfast?

1:32:29.378 --> 1:32:31.504
-Early lunch, or...
-Paul.

1:32:33.966 --> 1:32:35.420
Are you okay?

1:32:36.252 --> 1:32:37.336
No.

1:32:40.756 --> 1:32:42.588
Thank you for asking.

1:32:44.798 --> 1:32:47.000
Shorty! Let's go out for one.

1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:49.042
Paul, where are you going?

1:32:51.084 --> 1:32:52.672
<i>So, you moved off my brother-in-law?</i>

1:32:53.672 --> 1:32:55.630
We couldn't get a warrant.

1:32:57.252 --> 1:33:00.798
Last year we arranged for Leigh
to get help from a social worker.

1:33:00.798 --> 1:33:02.546
He only went twice.

1:33:02.546 --> 1:33:05.588
We saw him recently for
the first time in nine months.

1:33:05.588 --> 1:33:08.840
My mother-in-law brought him by
to see the new baby.

1:33:08.840 --> 1:33:12.252
After he left,
I went to see that social worker.

1:33:12.252 --> 1:33:15.672
He couldn't talk about a former patient,
so I just asked him straight out

1:33:15.672 --> 1:33:17.924
if he thought Leigh
was capable of killing people.

1:33:17.966 --> 1:33:21.210
-Because of patient confidentiality...
-The man said yes.

1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:25.294
Why hadn't you seen him
in nine months?

1:33:25.294 --> 1:33:27.294
He's going to school in Santa Rosa.

1:33:27.294 --> 1:33:30.714
-Santa Rosa? Where is he living?
-In his trailer.

1:33:30.714 --> 1:33:32.840
-In Santa Rosa?
-Sonoma County.

1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:35.168
We wouldn't have to go
through the Vallejo DA.

1:33:35.168 --> 1:33:36.756
It's been 11 months
since you talked to this guy,

1:33:36.756 --> 1:33:38.378
and now you wanna search his trailer?

1:33:38.378 --> 1:33:40.252
If we find something, great.

1:33:40.252 --> 1:33:43.546
If not, we get his prints and
handwriting samples from both hands.

1:33:43.546 --> 1:33:45.924
I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1:33:46.630 --> 1:33:49.126
What if I can get a second opinion?

1:33:50.252 --> 1:33:52.378
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes.
He trained me at this.

1:33:52.378 --> 1:33:55.252
Terry, all I need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous.

1:33:55.252 --> 1:33:59.252
Could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand?

1:34:00.924 --> 1:34:02.378
Between you and me?

1:34:02.378 --> 1:34:05.840
Because there are differing
schools of thought on this.

1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:11.546
Get the samples of his other hand.
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.

1:34:11.546 --> 1:34:14.210
<i>That's the current thinking,</i>
<i>according to Terry Pascoe.</i>

1:34:14.210 --> 1:34:17.588
Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist
who'd be willing to testify

1:34:17.588 --> 1:34:20.672
that someone who undergoes
a personality change like Zodiac

1:34:20.672 --> 1:34:23.714
would manifest it physically,
altering his handwriting.

1:34:23.714 --> 1:34:27.420
Which is why Sherwood couldn't
get a match from Allen's samples.

1:34:27.420 --> 1:34:29.756
We got Terry Pascoe,
this psychology guy,

1:34:29.756 --> 1:34:31.168
coupled with Cheney...

1:34:31.168 --> 1:34:32.756
It could be enough for a warrant.

1:34:32.756 --> 1:34:33.924
Get Cheney on the record.

1:34:34.168 --> 1:34:37.252
"And that he would call himself Zodiac."

1:34:38.336 --> 1:34:39.462
Yes.

1:34:39.462 --> 1:34:43.126
And you're willing to swear
to this, under oath, in Superior Court?

1:34:43.126 --> 1:34:44.630
Without any hesitation.

1:34:44.630 --> 1:34:46.882
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney.
Thank you very much for your time.

1:34:46.882 --> 1:34:48.000
Thank you.

1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:49.924
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.

1:34:49.924 --> 1:34:53.756
Lives in Sunset Trailer Court
in Santa Rosa, California.

1:34:53.756 --> 1:34:55.420
Physical description.

1:34:55.420 --> 1:34:57.756
Allen is similar in height,
weight and build

1:34:57.756 --> 1:35:00.966
to a man seen at Lake Berryessa
on the day of the stabbings.

1:35:00.966 --> 1:35:03.840
<i>I understand he doesn't look</i>
<i>much like the San Francisco composite.</i>

1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:05.462
True. Height and weight are sketchy,

1:35:05.504 --> 1:35:07.798
but lumbering Caucasian
with a crew cut is right on.

1:35:07.798 --> 1:35:10.168
We never had much confidence
in the composite from the kids.

1:35:10.168 --> 1:35:12.294
The patrolman
who say Zodiac that night

1:35:12.294 --> 1:35:13.840
said he didn't look much like the sketch.

1:35:13.882 --> 1:35:15.420
Military boot prints.

1:35:15.420 --> 1:35:18.252
Allen was in the Navy.
Wears a size 10-and-a-half.

1:35:18.252 --> 1:35:20.798
Same size as the prints
found at Berryessa.

1:35:20.798 --> 1:35:22.588
<i>What about gun?</i>

1:35:22.588 --> 1:35:27.252
Cheney says Allen owns several
firearms. We'll list them in the warrant.

1:35:27.252 --> 1:35:30.126
<i>-And the ciphers.</i>
-Could be code training in the Navy,

1:35:30.126 --> 1:35:32.966
and people have seen Allen
with ciphers in the past.

1:35:32.966 --> 1:35:34.084
<i>Really? Who?</i>

1:35:34.084 --> 1:35:36.966
That would be his sister-in-law
and a man named Phil Tucker

1:35:36.966 --> 1:35:39.378
that he worked with
at a public pool in Vallejo.

1:35:39.378 --> 1:35:42.966
And Phil Tucker told us about
a conversation that he had with Allen

1:35:42.966 --> 1:35:45.756
about how to attach a flashlight
to the barrel of a gun.

1:35:45.756 --> 1:35:49.084
That gives us two sources
on the ciphers and two on the flashlight.

1:35:49.084 --> 1:35:51.210
<i>What about his threats on children?</i>

1:35:51.210 --> 1:35:53.042
Suspect worked for elementary schools

1:35:53.042 --> 1:35:56.378
and was fired for molestation
in March, April '68.

1:35:56.378 --> 1:35:59.084
-Could give him motive.
-At the very least, it's home turf.

1:35:59.084 --> 1:36:01.252
He'd have knowledge of bus routes,

1:36:01.252 --> 1:36:03.798
which the two major threats
centered around.

1:36:03.798 --> 1:36:05.546
<i>What about the bomb?</i>

1:36:06.966 --> 1:36:09.000
Allen works as a chemist.

1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:10.546
Take him through the geography.

1:36:10.546 --> 1:36:12.126
Vallejo murders.

1:36:12.126 --> 1:36:15.714
Allen lives in Vallejo
with his mother in her basement.

1:36:15.714 --> 1:36:19.000
Berryessa murder. On the day
that the two kids were stabbed

1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.756
his neighbor saw bloody knives
in his truck

1:36:21.756 --> 1:36:24.756
which he claimed were used
to kill a chicken.

1:36:24.756 --> 1:36:26.714
<i>Does he have any alibis?</i>

1:36:26.714 --> 1:36:29.462
He claimed he did, but he's been unable
to produce the names

1:36:29.462 --> 1:36:32.840
of the couple he supposedly met
on the day of Berryessa.

1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:35.294
The bottom line is that Allen
can't alibi up on anything.

1:36:35.294 --> 1:36:37.210
Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.

1:36:37.210 --> 1:36:39.504
-You want to tell me about the name?
<i>-What name?</i>

1:36:39.504 --> 1:36:40.714
Zodiac.

1:36:40.714 --> 1:36:44.714
Allen wears a watch that bears
both the word and crosshair symbol.

1:36:44.714 --> 1:36:46.168
And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney

1:36:46.168 --> 1:36:48.756
a year and a half
before it appeared in any letter.

1:36:51.924 --> 1:36:54.462
-John...
<i>-That's pretty good, guys.</i>

1:36:54.462 --> 1:36:57.462
-We think so, too.
<i>-Let's take it to a judge.</i>

1:37:17.630 --> 1:37:19.000
Mr. Allen?

1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:21.126
This is the
Santa Rosa Police Department.

1:37:21.126 --> 1:37:23.966
We have a warrant
to search your residence.

1:37:34.966 --> 1:37:36.126
Hello?

1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:47.084
I'll check with the neighbors.

1:37:48.378 --> 1:37:49.504
Close the door.

1:37:49.504 --> 1:37:52.588
Close the door,
there's rodents running around.

1:38:04.924 --> 1:38:07.546
Neighbor said he tore out of here
about a half-hour ago.

1:38:07.546 --> 1:38:11.882
-You think somebody tipped him?
-We're not leaving till he comes back.

1:38:17.714 --> 1:38:19.462
I'll check the back.

1:38:32.168 --> 1:38:33.294
Jesus.

1:38:33.294 --> 1:38:34.924
-What?
-Squirrels.

1:38:37.042 --> 1:38:39.042
Piece of work, this guy.

1:38:45.924 --> 1:38:48.714
Not one, but two blue windbreakers.

1:38:48.714 --> 1:38:52.420
-Like the Stine scene?
-We'll have those checked for blood.

1:38:52.882 --> 1:38:55.798
And a pair of black gloves.

1:38:57.126 --> 1:39:00.504
Men's seven,
just like the ones we found in the cab.

1:39:00.504 --> 1:39:03.168
Well, he's got the same size shoes
and gloves as Z.

1:39:03.168 --> 1:39:05.672
Probably just a coincidence.

1:39:05.672 --> 1:39:09.546
Dave, I got a gun.
Check that. Two guns.

1:39:10.714 --> 1:39:14.042
They're both .22s.
One automatic, one revolver.

1:39:14.042 --> 1:39:15.672
Well, that's interesting.

1:39:15.672 --> 1:39:18.924
Because he happens to have
an M-1 rifle here in the closet.

1:39:18.924 --> 1:39:21.546
For little darlings bouncing off buses.

1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:24.546
Someone's here.

1:39:31.462 --> 1:39:33.924
Hello, Arthur. Remember us?

1:39:56.462 --> 1:39:57.630
No.

1:39:57.630 --> 1:39:58.798
On the handwriting?

1:39:58.798 --> 1:40:02.420
Ballistics, no match.
Prints, no match. Writing, no match.

1:40:02.420 --> 1:40:04.252
On both hands, right?

1:40:04.252 --> 1:40:06.126
Because we got handwriting
from both his hands.

1:40:06.168 --> 1:40:07.588
And neither hand matches.

1:40:07.588 --> 1:40:09.336
Forget Sherwood.
Let's get another opinion.

1:40:09.336 --> 1:40:11.336
Fellas, he's not your guy.

1:40:18.042 --> 1:40:19.252
Damn it.

1:40:26.420 --> 1:40:27.504
Hey.

1:40:28.336 --> 1:40:30.924
What do you want? Time off?

1:40:33.126 --> 1:40:34.252
A hug?

1:40:35.126 --> 1:40:37.168
Do you know what
the worst part of this is?

1:40:37.168 --> 1:40:39.168
I can't tell if I wanted it
to be Allen so bad

1:40:39.168 --> 1:40:42.546
because I actually thought it was him,
or I just want all this to be over.

1:40:42.546 --> 1:40:44.546
It's because you thought it was him.

1:40:44.546 --> 1:40:46.084
And I did, too.

1:40:48.882 --> 1:40:50.378
You know what? Take some time off.

1:40:50.378 --> 1:40:53.756
Spend some time with your wife
and the kids.

1:40:53.756 --> 1:40:56.336
Go to Candlestick. See a movie.

1:40:57.630 --> 1:41:03.042
<i>"To the city of San Francisco,</i>
<i>I will enjoy killing one person every day</i>

1:41:03.042 --> 1:41:05.462
<i>"until you pay me $100,000.</i>

1:41:06.462 --> 1:41:09.168
<i>"If you agree, say so tomorrow morning</i>

1:41:09.966 --> 1:41:13.000
<i>"in the personal column</i>
San Francisco Chronicle,

1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:15.084
<i>"and I will set up meeting.</i>

1:41:15.084 --> 1:41:16.798
<i>"If I do not hear from you,</i>

1:41:16.798 --> 1:41:19.798
<i>"it will be my next pleasure</i>

1:41:23.210 --> 1:41:24.672
<i>" ...Scorpio."</i>

1:41:27.042 --> 1:41:28.588
<i>Who's out of their minds?</i>

1:41:28.588 --> 1:41:30.756
I've got to get out of here.

1:41:30.756 --> 1:41:34.126
<i>Where the hell does he expect me</i>
<i>to find $100,000?</i>

1:41:34.126 --> 1:41:36.588
<i>You're not thinking of paying him,</i>
<i>are you, Mr. Mayor?</i>

1:41:36.588 --> 1:41:40.966
<i>The city of San Francisco does not</i>
<i>pay criminals not to commit a crime.</i>

1:42:03.924 --> 1:42:06.462
The killer gets shot in the chest.

1:42:06.462 --> 1:42:08.756
That's how it ends.

1:42:09.210 --> 1:42:10.924
Do I know you?

1:42:10.924 --> 1:42:13.798
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle with Paul Avery.

1:42:13.798 --> 1:42:15.462
Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you.

1:42:15.462 --> 1:42:18.042
Dave! That Harry Callahan
did a hell of a job with your case.

1:42:18.042 --> 1:42:20.672
Yeah. No need for due process, right?

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.084
-What do you do at the Chronicle?
-I'm a cartoonist.

1:42:27.084 --> 1:42:28.504
That's nice.

1:42:28.504 --> 1:42:30.420
You're gonna catch him.

1:42:32.042 --> 1:42:34.882
Pal, they're already
making movies about it.

1:42:42.630 --> 1:42:45.672
<i>We today have concluded</i>
<i>an agreement</i>

1:42:45.672 --> 1:42:49.378
<i>to end the war and bring peace</i>
<i>with honor in Vietnam.</i>

1:42:49.378 --> 1:42:52.546
<i>...Charles Manson for</i>
<i>the Tate-La Bianca mass murders...</i>

1:42:52.546 --> 1:42:54.924
<i>Guilty in the Chowchilla</i>
<i>kidnapping case.</i>

1:42:54.924 --> 1:42:57.294
<i>In the murder trial of one...</i>

1:42:57.294 --> 1:42:59.168
<i>Chairman Mao died today...</i>

1:42:59.168 --> 1:43:01.672
<i>...an absolute pardon</i>
<i>unto Richard Nixon...</i>

1:43:01.672 --> 1:43:04.672
<i>-No, I’m not a crook...</i>
<i>-...Generation of hostility...</i>

1:43:06.840 --> 1:43:09.882
<i>...has now led to the death</i>

<i>Patricia Hearst is kidnapped</i>
<i>by the Symbionese Liberation Army...</i>

1:43:15.756 --> 1:43:19.084
<i>All of us should stand up together</i>
<i>and say, "No more."</i>

1:43:20.672 --> 1:43:23.420
<i>Your Declaration of Independence</i>
<i>spreads that...</i>

1:43:23.420 --> 1:43:26.126
<i>Americans admire</i>
<i>the United Kingdom...</i>

1:43:26.126 --> 1:43:28.252
<i>Mr. Hoffa has disappeared.</i>

1:43:28.252 --> 1:43:31.798
<i>If we despise our own government...</i>

1:43:32.714 --> 1:43:35.126
<i>...that the police have captured a man</i>

1:43:35.126 --> 1:43:36.798
<i>whom they believe</i>
<i>to be the "Son of Sam..."</i>

1:43:52.252 --> 1:43:54.462
Hi. We haven't met.

1:43:54.462 --> 1:43:56.546
I'm Robert Graysmith.

1:43:56.546 --> 1:43:58.504
I'm Duffy Jennings.

1:43:58.504 --> 1:44:01.714
-Nice to meet you.
-Good to meet you, man.

1:44:01.714 --> 1:44:02.924
You got a great desk.

1:44:02.924 --> 1:44:05.042
Guy who used to work here
was a great reporter.

1:44:05.042 --> 1:44:06.420
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure he was.

1:44:06.420 --> 1:44:09.000
I mean, it's a honor
to leave the Chronicle

1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.882
and go work for the Sacramento Bee.

1:44:11.882 --> 1:44:14.084
Dare to dream, right, Robert?

1:44:17.756 --> 1:44:20.714
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

1:44:20.714 --> 1:44:22.924
I'm just right down there
at the Art department

1:44:22.924 --> 1:44:25.378
-if you need anything, Duffy.
-Yeah.

1:44:28.924 --> 1:44:31.672
-You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
-It's your turn.

1:44:31.672 --> 1:44:34.966
You could just drop me off at my place
and take the car.

1:44:34.966 --> 1:44:36.924
You should keep the car.

1:44:37.672 --> 1:44:38.756
Yeah?

1:44:39.294 --> 1:44:41.378
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

1:44:43.336 --> 1:44:44.840
Why? What's up?

1:44:46.042 --> 1:44:47.336
I'm done.

1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:50.798
I put in for a transfer.

1:44:56.798 --> 1:44:58.084
Where?

1:44:58.462 --> 1:45:00.084
Looking at Fraud.

1:45:02.294 --> 1:45:04.420
I can't be on call anymore.

1:45:07.168 --> 1:45:09.462
I wanna see these kids grow up.

1:45:10.630 --> 1:45:12.882
Hey, good for you, Bill.

1:45:14.756 --> 1:45:17.294
-You'll be okay.
-Yeah. I'll be fine.

1:45:19.336 --> 1:45:20.378
Hey,

1:45:21.462 --> 1:45:24.924
I'm not leaving you
holding the bag on anything, am I?

1:45:26.588 --> 1:45:27.630
No.

1:45:29.966 --> 1:45:31.042
Okay.

1:45:31.714 --> 1:45:33.420
Hey, you know what?

1:45:34.042 --> 1:45:38.294
Maybe you'll have a chance
to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.

1:45:39.252 --> 1:45:40.336
Yeah.

1:46:12.294 --> 1:46:14.042
I'm not Paul Avery.

1:46:16.924 --> 1:46:19.966
The boys need to be tucked in, please,
and the baby needs changing.

1:46:19.966 --> 1:46:22.294
-I'll flip you for it.
-You wish.

1:46:25.714 --> 1:46:28.420
Nobody has more Zodiac crap
than you do.

1:47:13.126 --> 1:47:15.336
-Are you kidding me?
-Hi, Paul.

1:47:17.084 --> 1:47:19.840
Permission to come aboard.
It's right there.

1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:22.420
Anyway, you got shoes on.
This is perfect right here.

1:47:22.420 --> 1:47:24.336
-That's the one.
-Okay.

1:47:26.042 --> 1:47:28.966
-See that? Mesmerizing.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:47:28.966 --> 1:47:31.630
My own kids
would kill me for one of those.

1:47:33.462 --> 1:47:35.798
-How are you?
-Fantastic.

1:47:35.798 --> 1:47:38.042
I mean, admittedly,

1:47:38.042 --> 1:47:40.462
the <i>Bee</i> ain't exactly
the <i>Chron</i>, but fuck it, right?

1:47:40.462 --> 1:47:43.462
Do you want a drink?
I don't have anything blue, but I got...

1:47:43.462 --> 1:47:45.546
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.

1:47:45.546 --> 1:47:49.126
It's no bother at all.
Nobody comes by from the old days.

1:47:49.504 --> 1:47:50.588
Cheers.

1:47:51.294 --> 1:47:53.462
To your health and mine.

1:47:55.378 --> 1:47:56.798
Mostly mine.

1:48:01.966 --> 1:48:03.504
So,

1:48:05.672 --> 1:48:07.042
what's new?

1:48:09.042 --> 1:48:11.042
-I've been thinking.
-Yeah.

1:48:11.042 --> 1:48:12.252
Somebody should write a book.

1:48:12.252 --> 1:48:15.294
Somebody should write a fucking book,
that's for sure.

1:48:15.294 --> 1:48:17.462
-About what?
-About Zodiac.

1:48:19.084 --> 1:48:20.588
It's not new.

1:48:20.588 --> 1:48:25.294
I've been thinking that
if you put all the information together,

1:48:25.294 --> 1:48:26.966
maybe you could jog something loose.

1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.588
And then I was thinking that
nobody knows the case better than you.

1:48:29.588 --> 1:48:30.714
Yeah. That's true.

1:48:30.714 --> 1:48:33.840
You know all the players,
and you have all the files.

1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:35.168
Lost them.

1:48:35.462 --> 1:48:36.630
You lost them?

1:48:36.630 --> 1:48:39.924
Or I tossed them. I don't know.
I moved onto a boat.

1:48:40.336 --> 1:48:42.504
You know that we work
in the daily business, right?

1:48:42.504 --> 1:48:43.882
As in, today.

1:48:43.882 --> 1:48:46.672
What do you think
we were doing back then?

1:48:47.630 --> 1:48:49.882
Do you know that more people die
in the East Bay commute

1:48:49.882 --> 1:48:52.252
every three months
than that idiot ever killed?

1:48:52.294 --> 1:48:53.546
He offed a few citizens,

1:48:53.546 --> 1:48:56.924
he wrote a few letters,
and he faded into a footnote.

1:49:02.378 --> 1:49:05.504
Not that I haven't been sitting here idly

1:49:05.504 --> 1:49:09.462
waiting for you to drop by
and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1:49:11.798 --> 1:49:15.042
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1:49:15.042 --> 1:49:17.756
You're wrong. It was important.

1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.546
Then, what did you ever do about it?

1:49:22.378 --> 1:49:24.588
If it was so fucking important,
what did you ever do?

1:49:24.630 --> 1:49:27.546
You hovered over my desk,
you stole from wastebaskets.

1:49:27.546 --> 1:49:29.210
Am I being unkind?

1:49:30.336 --> 1:49:33.630
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You went to the library.

1:49:36.420 --> 1:49:38.420
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1:50:00.504 --> 1:50:02.630
-Hey, hi.
-Hi.

1:50:02.630 --> 1:50:05.126
-Where you been?
-The library.

1:50:36.714 --> 1:50:38.042
Thank you!

1:50:53.756 --> 1:50:57.168
-Inspector Toschi?
-Yeah? One moment, please.

1:51:01.504 --> 1:51:02.756
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.042
We met at the movies once.

1:51:06.504 --> 1:51:07.966
It must have been magical.

1:51:07.966 --> 1:51:09.798
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle.

1:51:09.798 --> 1:51:12.630
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1:51:14.336 --> 1:51:16.084
Sure, why not?

1:51:16.084 --> 1:51:18.546
So, you're a friend of Paul Avery's?

1:51:18.546 --> 1:51:21.000
He's actually the reason I'm here.

1:51:22.714 --> 1:51:25.084
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1:51:25.546 --> 1:51:28.882
Well, I appreciate the interest,
but we don't discuss open cases.

1:51:28.882 --> 1:51:31.504
Oh, well, what's going on with it,
day to day?

1:51:31.504 --> 1:51:33.252
We're actively pursuing all leads.

1:51:33.252 --> 1:51:35.882
And you're the only one on it, right?

1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:38.504
Mr. Graysmith,

1:51:39.630 --> 1:51:41.672
Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1:51:41.672 --> 1:51:44.504
You know how many murders
we've had in San Francisco since then?

1:51:44.504 --> 1:51:46.126
-No.
-Over 200.

1:51:46.126 --> 1:51:49.504
That's a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need our help.

1:51:49.504 --> 1:51:51.252
So, nobody cares.

1:51:51.252 --> 1:51:53.714
Excuse me? I care.

1:51:56.378 --> 1:51:58.672
Okay. Can I show you something?

1:52:01.546 --> 1:52:04.840
I've been doing research
on the first cipher.

1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:06.714
Everything an amateur
would need to create it

1:52:06.714 --> 1:52:09.756
can be found in these books.

1:52:09.756 --> 1:52:13.210
Now, I started thinking
that if you can track these books,

1:52:13.210 --> 1:52:15.630
then maybe you can track the man.

1:52:16.126 --> 1:52:19.084
So, I remember you thought
that Zodiac was military,

1:52:19.084 --> 1:52:22.840
so I went to every base library
and I got a list of every person

1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:26.798
who's ever checked out these books
and that's when I found this.

1:52:31.546 --> 1:52:34.042
-Missing.
-It means they were stolen.

1:52:34.840 --> 1:52:38.504
So, almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the Presidio Library?

1:52:38.504 --> 1:52:41.126
And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.

1:52:43.924 --> 1:52:48.462
Somebody didn't want a record
of ever having checked out these books.

1:52:48.462 --> 1:52:50.084
Who are you again?

1:52:52.168 --> 1:52:53.840
I just wanna help.

1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:59.378
I can't allow you to help.

1:52:59.378 --> 1:53:01.252
I can't discuss the case with you.

1:53:01.252 --> 1:53:03.798
I can't give you information,
and I certainly couldn't tell you

1:53:03.798 --> 1:53:06.000
to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.

1:53:06.546 --> 1:53:07.966
N-A-R-L-O-W.

1:53:17.924 --> 1:53:22.714
I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith,
but we don't cooperate with writers.

1:53:22.714 --> 1:53:25.504
Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.

1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:28.714
-And Dave Toschi sent you?
-Yes.

1:53:28.714 --> 1:53:30.798
-Why?
-Maybe he...

1:53:30.798 --> 1:53:33.630
Maybe he thought
that I could do some good.

1:53:34.336 --> 1:53:38.504
-What are you, some kind of boy scout?
-Eagle Scout, actually, first class.

1:53:39.462 --> 1:53:42.672
Well, if you wanna do this,
don't let me stop you.

1:53:43.924 --> 1:53:46.042
Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.

1:53:46.966 --> 1:53:49.462
I understand what you're trying to do.

1:53:49.462 --> 1:53:51.756
But this is an open police investigation.

1:53:51.798 --> 1:53:53.966
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1:53:53.966 --> 1:53:57.336
And he said
that you might be able to help.

1:53:57.336 --> 1:54:00.294
I mean, the case is dead.
Zodiac's long gone.

1:54:01.168 --> 1:54:03.378
He's yesterday's news, right?

1:54:04.420 --> 1:54:06.210
That's what they say.

1:54:07.126 --> 1:54:09.042
So, what's the harm?

1:54:09.042 --> 1:54:10.546
<i>No pens, no paper.</i>

1:54:11.042 --> 1:54:13.840
Anything that you see that's relevant,
you got to remember in your head.

1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:14.924
Okay.

1:54:17.126 --> 1:54:18.546
Okay, here we go.

1:54:18.546 --> 1:54:20.714
-Which one?
-All of them.

1:54:20.714 --> 1:54:23.504
And there's more in the next room.
They're all marked with these numbers.

1:54:23.504 --> 1:54:24.798
243-146.

1:54:24.798 --> 1:54:26.756
You don't smoke, do you?

1:54:26.756 --> 1:54:28.882
Once. In high school.

1:54:32.252 --> 1:54:33.630
What's this?

1:54:34.546 --> 1:54:35.882
Thank you.

1:55:04.126 --> 1:55:06.126
<i>Man, you really creeped us out.</i>

1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000
<i>"Nine millimeter.</i>

1:55:15.546 --> 1:55:18.126
<i>"Said nothing and began firing."</i>

1:55:26.924 --> 1:55:28.294
"Most Dangerous Game.

1:55:28.294 --> 1:55:31.168
<i>"Do not eliminate this suspect</i>
<i>because of handwriting.</i>

1:55:31.168 --> 1:55:33.294
<i>"Not because of handwriting.</i>

1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:35.924
"Darlene's sister, Linda.

1:55:35.924 --> 1:55:38.630
"It was all just deep breathing. George.

1:55:39.210 --> 1:55:42.000
"It was a strange man. George.
Strange man."

1:55:42.966 --> 1:55:44.630
Thank you so much.

1:55:46.504 --> 1:55:48.504
Oh, briefcase. Oh, thanks.

1:55:51.210 --> 1:55:53.840
-Hey, Jack.
-Hey, Bawart.

1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:55.756
-Who's that?
-That's Graysmith.

1:55:55.756 --> 1:55:59.042
Some cartoonist.
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.

1:56:00.756 --> 1:56:02.084
Well, good for him.

1:56:32.504 --> 1:56:34.882
-Thank you for meeting me, Inspector.
-No. We're not meeting, Robert.

1:56:34.882 --> 1:56:36.504
We're just two guys
who happen to be sitting

1:56:36.504 --> 1:56:37.756
on the same bench at the same time.

1:56:37.756 --> 1:56:40.294
I've got five minutes.
I've got to get back to the Hall.

1:56:40.294 --> 1:56:43.126
Okay. As far as you know,
did anyone ever get in touch

1:56:43.126 --> 1:56:44.924
with Mike Mageau
during your investigation

1:56:44.924 --> 1:56:47.504
-and show him suspect photos?
-Why?

1:56:47.504 --> 1:56:50.000
Well, he's the only surviving victim
who ever saw Zodiac without a mask.

1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:51.462
No, I mean, why are you asking me?

1:56:51.462 --> 1:56:53.420
Mageau and Darlene,
that's Vallejo's case.

1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:56.294
Paul Stine is mine.
You've got four minutes now.

1:56:56.294 --> 1:56:58.714
Darlene Ferrin was being followed.

1:56:58.714 --> 1:57:00.546
Now, I know Mulanax says
that they already found this guy,

1:57:00.546 --> 1:57:01.672
a George Waters?

1:57:01.672 --> 1:57:03.546
But he also said
that she had a lot of admirers

1:57:03.546 --> 1:57:05.294
who would come to
the restaurant where she worked.

1:57:05.294 --> 1:57:07.000
-She was popular.
<i>-Very.</i>

1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:08.756
Yeah. So...

1:57:08.756 --> 1:57:10.756
She and her husband,
they move into their new house,

1:57:10.756 --> 1:57:12.504
and one night they throw
this painting party.

1:57:12.504 --> 1:57:13.714
And what's a painting party?

1:57:13.714 --> 1:57:15.798
It's a party where people come
and help you paint.

1:57:15.798 --> 1:57:16.966
Sounds like a terrible party.

1:57:16.966 --> 1:57:20.840
Well, supposedly,
somebody who's not Waters shows up.

1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:22.840
And Darlene is terrified of him.

1:57:22.840 --> 1:57:24.672
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?

1:57:24.672 --> 1:57:29.210
And if Zodiac knew Darlene,
then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.

1:57:29.210 --> 1:57:31.168
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1:57:31.168 --> 1:57:32.882
So if you wanna connect
Darlene to Zodiac,

1:57:32.882 --> 1:57:34.378
you're gonna have to find another way.

1:57:34.378 --> 1:57:35.798
I have another way.

1:57:35.798 --> 1:57:37.504
Phone calls the night
of Darlene's murder.

1:57:37.504 --> 1:57:40.714
-Yeah, Zodiac called the police.
-No, Dave, there were four other calls.

1:57:40.714 --> 1:57:43.084
There were two to Darlene's house,
one to Darlene's brother-in-law,

1:57:43.084 --> 1:57:45.504
and one to Darlene's father-in-law.
Just heavy breathing.

1:57:45.504 --> 1:57:47.462
They started around 1:30 a.m. ,

1:57:47.462 --> 1:57:51.210
and this was before anyone in the family
knew that Darlene had been shot.

1:57:51.210 --> 1:57:53.420
-This was in the Vallejo files?
-Yeah.

1:57:53.420 --> 1:57:54.546
God damn it.

1:57:54.546 --> 1:57:56.378
It's got to be more
than just a coincidence, right?

1:57:56.378 --> 1:57:59.336
I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly
prank phone call a victim's entire family

1:57:59.336 --> 1:58:01.504
90 minutes after they were shot.

1:58:01.504 --> 1:58:03.672
So, either Zodiac shoots
a random couple,

1:58:03.672 --> 1:58:05.252
then he recognizes Darlene...

1:58:05.252 --> 1:58:07.378
Or Darlene was shot on purpose.

1:58:07.378 --> 1:58:10.588
Either way,
Zodiac had to have known Darlene.

1:58:12.462 --> 1:58:14.210
That's good, Robert.

1:58:14.714 --> 1:58:18.000
So, I can't find Mageau,
so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.

1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:20.000
And maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is.

1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.840
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1:58:26.714 --> 1:58:28.336
You know,

1:58:28.336 --> 1:58:31.798
it's interesting that you should mention
Zodiac calling people at home.

1:58:31.798 --> 1:58:33.336
He did that in San Francisco once.

1:58:33.336 --> 1:58:34.924
What? Who did he call?

1:58:34.924 --> 1:58:38.000
I can't tell you.
That's privileged information.

1:58:38.630 --> 1:58:40.840
But maybe Melvin Belli could.

1:58:43.462 --> 1:58:45.042
Melvin Belli.

1:58:45.924 --> 1:58:48.294
How do I get to Melvin Belli?

1:58:48.294 --> 1:58:51.420
-He should be along soon.
-Oh, that's all right.

1:58:51.420 --> 1:58:53.882
I've really...
I've only been waiting two hours, so...

1:58:53.882 --> 1:58:55.798
He's usually not this late.

1:58:55.798 --> 1:58:58.630
Oh, cookies. Thank you.
These look great.

1:58:59.420 --> 1:59:03.420
-You are here on business?
-I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1:59:03.420 --> 1:59:06.462
I remember that. I spoke to him.

1:59:06.462 --> 1:59:11.168
-You mean to Mr. Belli about the case?
-No, to the Zodiac when he called.

1:59:11.168 --> 1:59:14.546
He said he had to kill
because it was his birthday.

1:59:14.546 --> 1:59:17.882
He said it... Wait.
He said it was his birthday?

1:59:17.924 --> 1:59:20.462
Yes. You want something to drink?

1:59:21.462 --> 1:59:25.504
-When was this?
-Oh, so many years ago.

1:59:27.168 --> 1:59:29.840
Mr. Belli was away for Christmas.

1:59:29.840 --> 1:59:31.168
Gone for a week.

1:59:31.168 --> 1:59:33.630
The Zodiac called,
wanting to talk to him.

1:59:33.630 --> 1:59:35.420
I said, "He is not here."

1:59:35.420 --> 1:59:38.420
He said, "I have to kill.
Today is my birthday."

1:59:38.420 --> 1:59:40.462
And then he hangs up.

1:59:40.462 --> 1:59:42.042
Then the letter arrived.

1:59:42.042 --> 1:59:46.210
So, the call came
before the letter of December 20th.

1:59:46.210 --> 1:59:48.210
Mr. Belli was gone for a week?

1:59:48.210 --> 1:59:52.084
He came back on Christmas.
Not a good day to work.

1:59:52.084 --> 1:59:54.042
So, he left on the 18th.

1:59:55.210 --> 1:59:56.756
Is that helpful?

1:59:56.756 --> 1:59:58.294
She said it was his birthday.

1:59:58.294 --> 2:00:02.210
<i>Well, you'd have to confirm that,</i>
<i>now wouldn't you?</i>

2:00:02.210 --> 2:00:03.714
How?

2:00:03.714 --> 2:00:06.924
<i>Well, I never spoke to her,</i>
<i>but maybe my partner did.</i>

2:00:06.924 --> 2:00:09.840
-How do I get a hold of him?
<i>-You don't. Bill wanted out of this.</i>

2:00:09.840 --> 2:00:12.210
<i>As far as I’m concerned,</i>
<i>he should stay out.</i>

2:00:12.210 --> 2:00:13.588
How do I confirm it?

2:00:13.588 --> 2:00:16.210
<i>Well, if my partner</i>
<i>did talk to someone from Justice,</i>

2:00:16.210 --> 2:00:17.882
<i>then they would've had</i>
<i>to put that in a report.</i>

2:00:17.882 --> 2:00:20.294
<i>That's standard procedure.</i>

2:00:20.294 --> 2:00:22.462
-Okay.
<i>-Mel Nicolai.</i>

2:00:22.462 --> 2:00:24.504
-Thank you.
<i>-Goodbye.</i>

2:00:24.504 --> 2:00:26.756
I just need to confirm a date.

2:00:26.756 --> 2:00:28.210
-Mr. Graysmith...
-I've narrowed it down

2:00:28.210 --> 2:00:30.588
between the 18th and the 20th
of December, and I just need...

2:00:30.588 --> 2:00:33.966
Okay, I'll play.
Let's say this phone call did take place.

2:00:33.966 --> 2:00:35.504
Let's say it really was Zodiac.

2:00:35.504 --> 2:00:38.378
Why would he volunteer
the day he was born?

2:00:38.378 --> 2:00:40.630
Plus, nobody died on December 18th,

2:00:40.630 --> 2:00:43.504
just like nobody died over the weekend
when he was gonna kill a dozen people,

2:00:43.504 --> 2:00:45.966
or when he was gonna
shoot school kids or blow up buses.

2:00:45.966 --> 2:00:47.420
He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.

2:00:47.420 --> 2:00:49.168
What if he made a mistake?

2:00:49.210 --> 2:00:51.336
What if he wasn't lying?
What if it was him on the phone?

2:00:51.336 --> 2:00:53.798
He didn't expect to pick it up,
a nice person to pick up.

2:00:53.798 --> 2:00:55.210
What if? What if? What if?

2:00:55.210 --> 2:00:58.672
Look, off the record,
Bill Armstrong checked this out.

2:00:58.672 --> 2:01:01.378
We took this very seriously.

2:01:01.378 --> 2:01:04.714
None of the suspects had the
same birthday as this phantom caller.

2:01:04.714 --> 2:01:06.924
Bill Armstrong.

2:01:12.462 --> 2:01:14.504
Can I give you a piece of advice?

2:01:14.504 --> 2:01:16.168
You're looking in the wrong place.

2:01:16.168 --> 2:01:19.336
Handwriting, fingerprints,
that's what this whole thing's about.

2:01:19.336 --> 2:01:20.672
Stick to the evidence.

2:01:21.714 --> 2:01:22.798
Hi.

2:01:31.084 --> 2:01:34.210
-Hey. How was your day?
-Long.

2:01:39.630 --> 2:01:41.126
Who's Sherwood Morrill?

2:01:41.126 --> 2:01:44.000
He's a handwriting expert
in Sacramento.

2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:45.210
He called.

2:01:45.210 --> 2:01:47.420
He said he can meet you
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

2:01:47.420 --> 2:01:48.798
Oh, great.

2:01:48.798 --> 2:01:51.672
-So you're taking off work?
-Just an hour.

2:01:53.420 --> 2:01:55.546
Sacramento's two hours away.

2:01:56.672 --> 2:01:58.294
-Really?
-Yes.

2:01:59.042 --> 2:02:00.672
What's this?

2:02:00.672 --> 2:02:03.378
Oh, that's that article.

2:02:03.378 --> 2:02:07.084
"Robert Graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the Zodiac."

2:02:07.084 --> 2:02:08.252
Yeah.

2:02:08.252 --> 2:02:11.000
It talks all about you
researching Zodiac.

2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:12.504
Well, that's what the article's about.

2:02:12.504 --> 2:02:15.042
I'm not so sure that's something
we want people to know about.

2:02:15.042 --> 2:02:16.210
Why? Are you embarrassed?

2:02:16.210 --> 2:02:19.420
Robert, what's the one thing
we know about Zodiac?

2:02:20.042 --> 2:02:21.336
He reads the Chronicle.

2:02:21.336 --> 2:02:23.882
Yeah, but he's never
gonna read Herb Caen.

2:02:28.504 --> 2:02:30.924
-Hello.
<i>-Mr. Graysmith?</i>

2:02:30.924 --> 2:02:33.588
<i>The Robert Graysmith</i>
<i>mentioned in the paper today?</i>

2:02:33.588 --> 2:02:36.714
-Yeah?
<i>-I can tell you who the Zodiac is.</i>

2:02:40.504 --> 2:02:41.630
Who is this?

2:02:41.630 --> 2:02:43.882
<i>The Zodiac Killer</i>
<i>is obsessed with movies.</i>

2:02:43.882 --> 2:02:46.672
<i>He recorded his murders on film.</i>

2:02:46.672 --> 2:02:50.126
<i>I tried to tell the police,</i>
<i>but they wouldn't follow through on it.</i>

2:02:50.126 --> 2:02:53.168
<i>There's a man you need to find.</i>
<i>His name is Bob Vaughn.</i>

2:02:53.168 --> 2:02:55.840
-Pen, pen.
<i>-V-A-U-G-H-N.</i>

2:02:55.840 --> 2:02:58.042
<i>He's a friend of the Zodiac's.</i>

2:02:58.042 --> 2:03:00.294
<i>Mr. Vaughn does not know</i>
<i>his friend is a killer,</i>

2:03:00.294 --> 2:03:03.000
<i>and he is storing</i>
<i>some film canisters for him.</i>

2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:04.798
<i>In these canisters is the evidence.</i>

2:03:04.798 --> 2:03:08.252
Okay, yeah, friend? Who is this friend?

2:03:08.252 --> 2:03:10.000
<i>You have quite enough to get started.</i>

2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:11.840
Oh, please.

2:03:11.840 --> 2:03:15.168
<i>The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.</i>

2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:20.882
Your toast is burning.

2:03:21.882 --> 2:03:26.924
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.

2:03:27.672 --> 2:03:30.000
Once we lock that into our brains,

2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.378
our handwriting may change
over the years,

2:03:32.378 --> 2:03:35.168
but the moves themselves
remain unaltered.

2:03:35.168 --> 2:03:36.672
-Understand?
-Yes.

2:03:38.252 --> 2:03:40.210
Except Zodiac's doesn't.

2:03:41.798 --> 2:03:43.756
Specifically with his "K."

2:03:44.966 --> 2:03:47.966
In his first letters,
he executed the "K" with two strokes.

2:03:47.966 --> 2:03:49.546
Later letters, he did them with three.

2:03:49.546 --> 2:03:51.924
-Why?
-We don't know.

2:03:51.924 --> 2:03:53.966
Excuse me, I've got to spray this.

2:03:53.966 --> 2:03:57.168
How many suspects
were cleared through handwriting?

2:03:57.168 --> 2:03:58.714
All of them.

2:03:58.714 --> 2:04:02.294
Also the print in the cab.
No match was ever found.

2:04:02.294 --> 2:04:06.420
Is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test?

2:04:06.420 --> 2:04:07.504
No.

2:04:07.504 --> 2:04:10.714
Whoever the Zodiac is,
he's not someone I cleared.

2:04:11.630 --> 2:04:15.210
About a month ago, a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught.

2:04:15.210 --> 2:04:17.294
His name was Wallace Penny.

2:04:18.210 --> 2:04:20.588
He said he knew who the Zodiac was.

2:04:20.588 --> 2:04:22.714
Gave me a name.

2:04:22.714 --> 2:04:25.000
Rick. Rick somebody.

2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:27.504
-Rick Marshall?
-Yeah.

2:04:27.504 --> 2:04:30.126
I think that the man
who you talked to called me, too.

2:04:30.126 --> 2:04:32.840
After he left, then I checked my files.

2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:34.588
I never cleared a Rick Marshall.

2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:43.000
Hello?

2:04:48.126 --> 2:04:49.882
Hello? Who is this?

2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:01.966
It's the wrong number.

2:05:07.882 --> 2:05:11.042
Does the name Rick Marshall
mean anything to you?

2:05:12.042 --> 2:05:14.168
What are you after?

2:05:14.168 --> 2:05:15.336
What do you got?

2:05:15.378 --> 2:05:19.630
Hypothetically, you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case.

2:05:20.756 --> 2:05:22.336
This is off the record.

2:05:22.336 --> 2:05:24.756
Couple years back,
I was trying to get Marshall's prints.

2:05:24.756 --> 2:05:26.588
I handed him a photo.

2:05:26.588 --> 2:05:29.084
He looks at it. He's about to give it back
and he stops and he says,

2:05:29.084 --> 2:05:31.588
"My goodness,
I got fingerprints all over this."

2:05:31.588 --> 2:05:33.462
And he wipes them off.

2:05:34.168 --> 2:05:35.966
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

2:05:35.966 --> 2:05:38.714
Because when they finally
did run his prints,

2:05:38.714 --> 2:05:41.084
they cleared him
against the one in Stine's cab.

2:05:41.084 --> 2:05:43.294
-So, then, it's not him.
-Maybe yes, maybe no.

2:05:43.294 --> 2:05:45.420
No. What do you mean?

2:05:45.420 --> 2:05:47.882
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.

2:05:47.882 --> 2:05:50.000
If he had the foresight
to bring gloves with him

2:05:50.042 --> 2:05:52.126
how the hell's he gonna
accidentally leave a print behind?

2:05:52.126 --> 2:05:54.210
But it was in the victim's blood.

2:05:54.210 --> 2:05:55.672
Could have been one of the bystanders,

2:05:55.672 --> 2:05:58.126
or a cop just reaches out,
boom, false print.

2:05:58.126 --> 2:06:00.588
Yeah, but that print
disqualified 2,500 suspects.

2:06:00.588 --> 2:06:02.000
Which is why we also used handwriting.

2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:03.420
But not for Rick Marshall.

2:06:03.420 --> 2:06:06.588
SFPD saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house.

2:06:06.588 --> 2:06:10.504
Decided it looked nothing
like the Z letters, so they just moved on.

2:06:10.504 --> 2:06:12.840
How do they know
that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?

2:06:12.840 --> 2:06:14.126
My thoughts exactly.

2:06:15.126 --> 2:06:18.882
Rick Marshall was a Navy man.
He received code training.

2:06:18.882 --> 2:06:21.420
He was also a projectionist
at a silent film theater.

2:06:21.420 --> 2:06:23.630
Well, then, how do I get copies
of Rick Marshall's handwriting?

2:06:23.630 --> 2:06:27.588
Three ways.
One, get a warrant, which you can't.

2:06:27.588 --> 2:06:29.840
Two, get him to volunteer,
which he won't.

2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:31.840
Yeah, and three?

2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:33.588
Get creative.

2:06:33.588 --> 2:06:36.420
<i>I don't know what to tell you.</i>
<i>You get it, I’ll analyze it.</i>

2:06:36.420 --> 2:06:37.882
<i>Beyond that, you're on your own.</i>

2:06:37.882 --> 2:06:40.420
Okay, what about
the guy who came to see you,

2:06:40.420 --> 2:06:41.924
the one who called me?

2:06:41.924 --> 2:06:44.462
<i>You mean Wallace Penny?</i>

2:06:44.462 --> 2:06:46.630
Yeah. Did he leave a number?

2:06:55.924 --> 2:06:59.294
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.

2:06:59.294 --> 2:07:00.378
<i>How did you find me?</i>

2:07:00.378 --> 2:07:02.546
I need a sample
of Rick Marshall's handwriting.

2:07:02.546 --> 2:07:03.924
<i>I told you. Vaughn is who...</i>

2:07:03.924 --> 2:07:07.000
Mr. Penny,
if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,

2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:09.588
I need a sample of his handwriting
to confirm it.

2:07:09.588 --> 2:07:11.210
Can you help me or not?

2:07:12.882 --> 2:07:17.630
<i>Rick used to draw movie posters</i>
<i>for the theater Vaughn worked at.</i>

2:07:17.630 --> 2:07:19.588
<i>-I’ll send one down.</i>
-Thank you.

2:07:29.546 --> 2:07:32.042
-I'll need to see more samples.
-Yeah, but is it...

2:07:32.042 --> 2:07:34.672
It's as close as I've ever seen.
We have to tread lightly here.

2:07:34.672 --> 2:07:37.210
We're talking about
implicating this man as the Zodiac.

2:07:37.210 --> 2:07:40.294
I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn
and I'll track down Linda.

2:07:40.294 --> 2:07:42.378
I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.

2:07:42.378 --> 2:07:45.168
I've been to the DMV,
and I talked to her parents,

2:07:45.168 --> 2:07:48.378
but still, nobody knows
where to find her.

2:07:48.378 --> 2:07:52.966
Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing
matches the exemplar.

2:07:52.966 --> 2:07:56.084
In a way, though, it's the part that
doesn't match that scares me the most.

2:07:56.084 --> 2:07:58.588
-What do you mean?
-Well, on the poster,

2:07:58.588 --> 2:08:01.798
the one letter that absolutely,
positively does not match

2:08:01.798 --> 2:08:03.378
is the letter "K."

2:08:05.378 --> 2:08:09.336
You wouldn't happen to have any
animal crackers in there, would you?

2:08:09.336 --> 2:08:12.924
<i>Unit Five.</i>
<i>Toschi needs to call in on a landline.</i>

2:08:24.924 --> 2:08:27.378
<i>-Dispatch.</i>
-Hey. Dave Toschi.

2:08:27.378 --> 2:08:29.000
<i>I’ll connect you.</i>

2:08:29.924 --> 2:08:31.420
<i>-Dave?</i>
-Yeah. What's up?

2:08:31.420 --> 2:08:33.966
Jennings here from the Chronicle.

2:08:33.966 --> 2:08:35.840
It came in this morning
and you need to see it right now.

2:08:35.882 --> 2:08:37.042
See what?

2:08:37.042 --> 2:08:39.882
<i>The new Zodiac letter.</i>
<i>And it mentions you.</i>

2:08:39.882 --> 2:08:40.966
Okay, okay.

2:08:43.210 --> 2:08:45.588
Shit. All right, come on.

2:08:45.588 --> 2:08:47.630
Hall of Justice!

2:08:47.630 --> 2:08:50.714
Now! Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

2:08:57.042 --> 2:08:58.126
Dave!

2:08:59.252 --> 2:09:01.210
Do you have it with you?

2:09:04.462 --> 2:09:06.756
"This is the Zodiac speaking.
I'm back with you.

2:09:06.756 --> 2:09:09.924
"Tell Herb Caen I am here,
I have always been here.

2:09:09.924 --> 2:09:13.042
"That city pig Toschi is good,
but I am smarter and better.

2:09:13.042 --> 2:09:16.042
"He will get tired, then leave me alone.

2:09:16.042 --> 2:09:19.420
"I'm waiting for a good movie about me.
Who will play me?

2:09:19.420 --> 2:09:21.630
"I'm now in control of all things."

2:09:21.630 --> 2:09:24.336
These guys are from Internal Affairs.

2:09:26.126 --> 2:09:27.840
We need to talk.

2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:29.714
<i>Good evening. Our top story tonight,</i>

2:09:29.714 --> 2:09:32.294
<i>the San Francisco Police Department</i>
<i>has confirmed</i>

2:09:32.294 --> 2:09:34.924
<i>that the man</i>
<i>who calls himself the Zodiac</i>

2:09:34.924 --> 2:09:39.378
<i>and terrorized the Bay Area</i>
<i>has broken his silence of 51 months.</i>

2:09:39.378 --> 2:09:42.126
<i>In a letter claiming,</i>
<i>"I am back with you,"</i>

2:09:42.126 --> 2:09:45.882
<i>the Zodiac makes no overt threats</i>
<i>against the citizenry,</i>

2:09:45.882 --> 2:09:48.798
<i>and muses that his life and times</i>
<i>would make the best movie script yet.</i>

2:09:48.798 --> 2:09:50.378
These carrots are perfect.

2:09:50.378 --> 2:09:51.882
<i>The terse 66 word message</i>
<i>also manages...</i>

2:09:51.882 --> 2:09:53.000
Just go.

2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:56.084
...to mention San Francisco Chronicle
<i>columnist Herb Caen</i>

2:09:56.084 --> 2:09:59.084
<i>and the Department's own</i>
<i>David Toschi by name.</i>

2:09:59.126 --> 2:10:00.798
-May I be excused?
<i>-Are they targets?</i>

2:10:00.798 --> 2:10:01.924
Fine, but you have to come back

2:10:01.924 --> 2:10:03.630
and finish at least half
of what's on that plate.

2:10:03.630 --> 2:10:04.840
<i>More team coverage</i>
<i>on the cipher slayer's return...</i>

2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:05.966
-Okay?
-Okay.

2:10:05.966 --> 2:10:08.504
<i>...begins as Alan Freeman has more.</i>

2:10:08.504 --> 2:10:09.756
<i>Thank you, Eric.</i>

2:10:09.756 --> 2:10:12.336
San Francisco Chronicle columnist
<i>Armistead Maupin says</i>

2:10:12.336 --> 2:10:15.000
<i>that he thinks not only</i>
<i>is this new letter a forgery,</i>

2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:17.042
<i>but it was written by the very man</i>

2:10:17.042 --> 2:10:20.882
<i>trusted to hunt down this killer,</i>
<i>David Toschi.</i>

2:10:20.882 --> 2:10:24.672
<i>Maupin, a very well-respected author,</i>
<i>has gone on record saying</i>

2:10:24.672 --> 2:10:29.378
<i>that he believes Toschi wrote the letter</i>
<i>to drum up publicity for himself.</i>

2:10:29.378 --> 2:10:32.546
Maupin used David
as a character in his column.

2:10:32.546 --> 2:10:34.546
David got a kick out of it

2:10:34.546 --> 2:10:36.630
and so he wrote
a couple of anonymous letters

2:10:36.630 --> 2:10:38.630
asking for the character
to be brought back.

2:10:38.630 --> 2:10:41.756
<i>It was like</i>
<i>writing fan mail to himself. That's all.</i>

2:10:41.756 --> 2:10:44.042
<i>But David did not write that letter.</i>

2:10:44.042 --> 2:10:47.294
No, I'm sure that he didn't.
And I'm sure that this will all blow over.

2:10:47.294 --> 2:10:48.714
<i>Blow over?</i>

2:10:48.714 --> 2:10:51.042
They kicked him out of Homicide.

2:10:51.042 --> 2:10:54.378
They made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal.

2:10:54.378 --> 2:10:56.756
-May I talk to him?
<i>-No.</i>

2:10:57.798 --> 2:10:59.084
Okay, can you just ask him

2:10:59.084 --> 2:11:01.546
if he ever investigated
a man named Rick Marshall?

2:11:01.546 --> 2:11:03.420
Is that all you can think about?

2:11:03.420 --> 2:11:06.840
Mr. Graysmith,
Maupin works at your paper. We trust...

2:11:12.630 --> 2:11:14.084
This girl, she wants music lessons?

2:11:14.084 --> 2:11:15.588
Dave! Dave!

2:11:18.042 --> 2:11:20.336
I'll catch up to you.

2:11:20.336 --> 2:11:22.672
You stop calling my house.
Do you understand me?

2:11:22.672 --> 2:11:24.462
I just need your help to find Linda.

2:11:24.462 --> 2:11:26.504
-Jesus.
-Look, two seconds.

2:11:28.462 --> 2:11:30.966
Look, we've been
running handwriting samples.

2:11:30.966 --> 2:11:33.294
-Who's we?
-Sherwood and I.

2:11:33.294 --> 2:11:34.504
Sherwood?

2:11:34.504 --> 2:11:36.714
Sherwood who was fired
from Questioned Documents?

2:11:36.714 --> 2:11:38.378
Sherwood who drinks
like Paul Avery now?

2:11:38.378 --> 2:11:40.966
-He retired.
-Is that what he told you?

2:11:40.966 --> 2:11:45.168
-What, are you saying he's wrong?
-I'm saying stop calling my house.

2:11:45.756 --> 2:11:47.378
-We ran them on Rick Marshall.
-No, Robert.

2:11:47.378 --> 2:11:48.798
No, I know you don't think it's him.

2:11:48.798 --> 2:11:50.336
I mean, no, I am not having
this conversation.

2:11:50.336 --> 2:11:53.252
But I think that Marshall knew Darlene,
and I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,

2:11:53.252 --> 2:11:54.336
so I'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn.

2:11:54.336 --> 2:11:55.672
-Robert. Robert, stop it!
-What?

2:11:55.672 --> 2:11:58.042
Okay, the Rick Marshalls
of this world will suck you dry.

2:11:58.042 --> 2:11:59.084
They're blind alleys.

2:11:59.084 --> 2:12:01.672
But he said he wasn't gonna announce
his murders anymore, Dave.

2:12:01.672 --> 2:12:02.840
He was just gonna do them.

2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:05.882
Do you know what the chances
of us arresting someone are now?

2:12:05.882 --> 2:12:10.084
Too much time has gone by, okay?
Too much of the evidence is lost.

2:12:10.084 --> 2:12:13.336
People get old, Robert. They forget.

2:12:13.336 --> 2:12:17.588
Now, I have been a cop for 25 years.
Murder police for 12.

2:12:17.588 --> 2:12:19.966
-What do you do for a living?
-You know what I do for a living.

2:12:19.966 --> 2:12:22.294
-You're a cartoonist.
-So what are you saying?

2:12:22.336 --> 2:12:25.462
I am saying Zodiac was my job.
It is not yours.

2:12:28.672 --> 2:12:31.126
-He's still out there, Dave.
-No, Robert. I am through with this.

2:12:31.126 --> 2:12:33.042
I am through with you.

2:12:39.336 --> 2:12:41.924
What about September 26, 1970?

2:12:41.924 --> 2:12:45.504
-Okay, which one was that?
-The Lake Tahoe nurse goes missing.

2:12:48.462 --> 2:12:49.924
One day before the vernal equinox.

2:12:49.924 --> 2:12:51.924
-Dad?
-Yeah. Mark that.

2:12:51.924 --> 2:12:55.672
Got another one. June 19th, 1971.

2:12:55.672 --> 2:12:58.462
That's got to be
near the summer solstice.

2:13:00.798 --> 2:13:02.168
Oh, guys.

2:13:02.168 --> 2:13:05.210
Don't tell Mom about
our special project, okay?

2:13:05.714 --> 2:13:09.336
How come you and Mom
don't sleep in the same bed anymore?

2:13:12.924 --> 2:13:13.966
Hello.

2:13:13.966 --> 2:13:16.126
<i>Mr. Graysmith,</i>
<i>it's Ken Narlow from Napa.</i>

2:13:16.126 --> 2:13:20.504
Oh, Captain Narlow.
Thank you for calling me back.

2:13:20.504 --> 2:13:22.462
<i>Yeah. How can I help?</i>

2:13:22.462 --> 2:13:25.252
I called you because we've been
cross-referencing lunar cycles

2:13:25.252 --> 2:13:27.000
with the Zodiac's timeline.

2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:31.336
More often than not, each cycle
since '69 corresponds with an attack

2:13:31.336 --> 2:13:34.294
or with one of the letters,
or an unsolved homicide.

2:13:34.294 --> 2:13:37.210
<i>-Who's working with you on this?</i>
-Some colleagues.

2:13:37.210 --> 2:13:38.294
Dad?

2:13:39.588 --> 2:13:42.126
-Ken, can you hold on one second?
-Dad?

2:13:42.126 --> 2:13:44.168
-What is it?
-What's this?

2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:51.168
<i>In the decade since the Zodiac's</i>
<i>last cipher was received,</i>

2:13:51.168 --> 2:13:54.756
<i>every federal agency</i>
<i>has taken a crack at decoding it.</i>

2:13:54.756 --> 2:13:57.630
<i>But today,</i>
<i>where those agencies had failed,</i>

<i>How did you do it?</i>

2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:07.420
<i>Oh, just a lot of books from the library,</i>
<i>and I love puzzles, so I just...</i>

2:14:09.504 --> 2:14:11.798
Yeah. The fucking library.

<i>I believe that you can accomplish</i>
<i>anything that you put your mind...</i>

2:14:17.840 --> 2:14:20.630
That's a "J"? Okay. Honor Camp?

2:14:22.252 --> 2:14:23.882
Thank you so much.

2:14:25.882 --> 2:14:28.210
Hey, we found Linda.
She's in jail. Isn't that great?

2:14:28.210 --> 2:14:29.462
Why'd you do it?

2:14:29.462 --> 2:14:30.966
Because she'll be able to identify Rick...

2:14:30.966 --> 2:14:33.714
-What are you talking about?
-You went on TV.

2:14:34.294 --> 2:14:36.042
You put yourself out there
for him to see.

2:14:36.042 --> 2:14:37.672
Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.

2:14:37.672 --> 2:14:39.756
Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.

2:14:39.756 --> 2:14:40.840
The who's been calling our house
in the middle of the night?

2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:42.042
Nobody.

2:14:44.042 --> 2:14:45.798
What's it gonna take
for you to be done with this?

2:14:45.798 --> 2:14:48.798
I can't talk about this now.
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

2:14:48.798 --> 2:14:52.252
Well, that's too bad,
because we're gonna talk about this.

2:14:52.252 --> 2:14:54.672
And when is it gonna be finished?

2:14:54.672 --> 2:14:56.588
When you catch him?
When you arrest him?

2:14:56.588 --> 2:14:58.840
-Be serious.
-I am serious.

2:15:00.630 --> 2:15:04.210
I need to know who he is.

2:15:04.210 --> 2:15:07.462
I need to stand there,

2:15:07.462 --> 2:15:11.378
I need to look him in the eye
and I need to know that it's him.

2:15:13.252 --> 2:15:15.630
Is that more important
than your family's safety?

2:15:15.630 --> 2:15:17.126
Of course not.

2:15:19.084 --> 2:15:21.504
Why? Why do you need to do this?

2:15:23.378 --> 2:15:24.462
Why?

2:15:26.420 --> 2:15:28.504
Because nobody else will.

2:15:28.504 --> 2:15:30.546
That's not good enough.

2:15:30.546 --> 2:15:32.420
Are you done? Can I go?

2:15:47.714 --> 2:15:49.840
-Mr. Vaughn?
-Mr. Graysmith?

2:15:49.882 --> 2:15:51.000
-Yes.
-Hi.

2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:52.420
You needed to speak to me?

2:15:52.420 --> 2:15:54.924
Yes. There's a coffee shop
right on the corner.

2:15:54.924 --> 2:15:58.084
-Why don't we just go to my home?
-Oh, I don't wanna put you out.

2:15:58.084 --> 2:16:00.084
It's no trouble at all.

2:16:00.084 --> 2:16:02.672
-Where are you parked?
-Just right there.

2:16:02.672 --> 2:16:06.042
-You can follow me.
-Oh. Okay.

2:16:24.714 --> 2:16:26.336
Watch your step.

2:16:27.798 --> 2:16:29.504
Come in.

2:16:30.882 --> 2:16:34.084
-Very nice house.
-Oh, thank you.

2:16:34.084 --> 2:16:36.042
It's very rustic.

2:16:36.042 --> 2:16:39.294
-Can I take your jacket?
-No, thank you, I'm fine.

2:16:39.294 --> 2:16:41.294
Okay. This way, please.

2:16:44.084 --> 2:16:45.924
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

2:16:45.924 --> 2:16:48.546
-How about some tea?
-Oh, no, I'm all right.

2:16:48.546 --> 2:16:50.000
-You sure?
-Yes.

2:16:50.882 --> 2:16:54.714
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played

2:16:54.714 --> 2:16:56.714
while you were the organist there.

2:16:56.714 --> 2:16:59.084
<i>The Most Dangerous Game?</i>

2:16:59.084 --> 2:17:02.546
Oh, it's a classic. R KO. 1932.

2:17:02.546 --> 2:17:07.336
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.

2:17:07.336 --> 2:17:08.882
In '68, '69?

2:17:10.462 --> 2:17:12.756
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2:17:12.756 --> 2:17:14.882
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2:17:17.084 --> 2:17:19.462
This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

2:17:19.462 --> 2:17:22.966
-He was a projectionist there, right?
-For a time, yes.

2:17:22.966 --> 2:17:27.084
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.

2:17:27.084 --> 2:17:29.672
Okay. Well, there is a connection

2:17:29.672 --> 2:17:32.546
between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.

2:17:32.546 --> 2:17:34.294
You mean the symbol?

2:17:35.546 --> 2:17:36.756
Hold on.

2:17:37.294 --> 2:17:41.420
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.

2:17:45.294 --> 2:17:48.000
It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown,

2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:50.630
but it always arrives with it.

2:17:50.630 --> 2:17:52.042
Right there.

2:17:52.630 --> 2:17:56.336
The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.

2:17:57.168 --> 2:17:58.840
We got a tip

2:17:58.840 --> 2:18:02.882
that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.

2:18:02.882 --> 2:18:06.000
A tip about a mysterious film canister?

2:18:06.882 --> 2:18:08.210
Is it true?

2:18:10.126 --> 2:18:11.336
Yes.

2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:14.420
-Did you open it?
-No.

2:18:14.420 --> 2:18:18.714
-May I see it?
-Rick took it back in 1972.

2:18:20.420 --> 2:18:25.294
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?

2:18:25.294 --> 2:18:27.042
That and the poster.

2:18:27.042 --> 2:18:28.420
The poster?

2:18:30.336 --> 2:18:32.210
The poster that Rick drew.

2:18:32.210 --> 2:18:35.504
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.

2:18:35.504 --> 2:18:38.882
-Rick didn't draw any posters.
-No, he drew this one.

2:18:38.882 --> 2:18:42.336
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

2:18:43.714 --> 2:18:45.588
That's my handwriting.

2:18:53.840 --> 2:18:56.798
I won't take any more of your time.

2:18:56.798 --> 2:19:02.294
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?

2:19:02.294 --> 2:19:03.840
Oh, that's all right.

2:19:03.840 --> 2:19:07.294
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.

2:19:09.084 --> 2:19:12.042
Not many people
have basements in California.

2:19:14.714 --> 2:19:15.798
I do.

2:19:17.966 --> 2:19:19.966
You coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2:19:31.252 --> 2:19:34.966
The original studio one-sheets,
I always kept for myself.

2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:39.462
The cheapo knock-offs
like you brought today

2:19:39.462 --> 2:19:42.588
I end up tossing into the back alley.

2:19:57.084 --> 2:19:58.588
'69.

2:20:04.294 --> 2:20:05.630
You live alone?

2:20:05.630 --> 2:20:11.504
Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2:20:11.504 --> 2:20:13.966
So, that would be about

2:20:14.840 --> 2:20:18.168
nine weeks before
the first Zodiac letter, correct?

2:20:21.042 --> 2:20:22.168
Yeah.

2:20:26.630 --> 2:20:30.924
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?

2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:39.924
Are you sure
there's nobody else in the house?

2:20:41.504 --> 2:20:44.210
Would you like
to go upstairs and check?

2:20:44.924 --> 2:20:45.966
No.

2:20:49.042 --> 2:20:51.630
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2:20:52.462 --> 2:20:53.966
You're welcome.

2:21:15.210 --> 2:21:16.630
It's locked.

2:21:27.462 --> 2:21:28.798
Thank you.

2:21:31.924 --> 2:21:33.924
Good night, Mr. Graysmith!

2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:57.546
Two killers. Got to be two killers.
One has the...

2:22:05.420 --> 2:22:06.588
Guys?

2:22:40.126 --> 2:22:42.084
You've got five minutes.

2:22:50.252 --> 2:22:51.420
Linda?

2:22:52.546 --> 2:22:54.042
Hi, I'm Robert.

2:22:58.000 --> 2:22:59.756
Did you get my note?

2:23:00.672 --> 2:23:02.672
-What's this about?
-Zodiac.

2:23:04.210 --> 2:23:05.462
Figures.

2:23:06.798 --> 2:23:09.630
-You got the look.
-What look?

2:23:09.630 --> 2:23:11.672
I didn't mean anything.

2:23:12.924 --> 2:23:15.294
Tell me about this painting party.

2:23:16.462 --> 2:23:19.084
I told the cops about that so long ago.

2:23:22.546 --> 2:23:24.420
Darlene always had
a lot of boys around,

2:23:24.420 --> 2:23:26.462
even though she was married.

2:23:26.462 --> 2:23:28.546
And this one guy was weird, though.

2:23:28.546 --> 2:23:31.924
He used to bring her presents
from Tijuana and...

2:23:33.126 --> 2:23:35.840
I don't know why
she was friends with him.

2:23:35.840 --> 2:23:38.378
She once told me he'd killed somebody.

2:23:38.378 --> 2:23:40.042
Really?

2:23:40.042 --> 2:23:42.378
Yeah, I think maybe
when he was in the service.

2:23:42.378 --> 2:23:44.420
-Navy?
-I think so.

2:23:44.420 --> 2:23:46.714
Was he into movies?
Was he a movie buff?

2:23:46.714 --> 2:23:49.714
I can tell you that
he was not into people.

2:23:49.714 --> 2:23:51.126
The party Darlene threw,

2:23:51.126 --> 2:23:54.126
people were supposed to
just show up and drink beer, help paint.

2:23:54.126 --> 2:23:56.462
But this guy showed up in a suit,

2:23:56.462 --> 2:23:59.504
and just sat in a chair
all by himself all night long.

2:23:59.504 --> 2:24:01.042
Didn't talk to anyone.

2:24:01.042 --> 2:24:03.000
And Darlene told me
to stay away from him.

2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:04.840
She was scared of him.

2:24:07.084 --> 2:24:09.672
And a couple of weeks later,
she was dead.

2:24:09.672 --> 2:24:12.126
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2:24:13.126 --> 2:24:17.084
I mean, it was short,
like a nickname, like Stan.

2:24:17.084 --> 2:24:19.420
-Rick?
-No, I don't think so.

2:24:20.294 --> 2:24:22.588
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

2:24:22.588 --> 2:24:25.252
How can you be sure?
It was a long time ago. Think hard.

2:24:25.252 --> 2:24:27.378
I am thinking hard.

2:24:27.378 --> 2:24:28.798
It was Rick.

2:24:29.798 --> 2:24:30.966
No, it wasn't.

2:24:30.966 --> 2:24:33.462
-It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.
-No.

2:24:33.462 --> 2:24:35.252
Just say it!

2:24:35.252 --> 2:24:37.126
It wasn't Rick.

2:24:49.882 --> 2:24:51.210
It was Leigh.

2:24:54.378 --> 2:24:56.924
-Leigh?
-Yeah, Leigh.

2:24:58.252 --> 2:24:59.588
Sounds right.

2:25:04.378 --> 2:25:07.294
Officer! I need you to let me in.

2:25:07.294 --> 2:25:09.546
-Is this an emergency?
-No, I just need to see one file.

2:25:09.546 --> 2:25:11.294
No, you need to come back
tomorrow morning.

2:25:11.294 --> 2:25:13.588
-One file, just for one second.
-8:00 a.m. , when we're open.

2:25:13.588 --> 2:25:15.336
Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!

2:25:15.336 --> 2:25:17.882
Sergeant, I just need to see one file!

2:25:17.882 --> 2:25:21.294
Just give me five minutes.
I know exactly where it is.

2:25:22.252 --> 2:25:23.462
Please!

2:25:36.798 --> 2:25:38.588
I shouldn't be talking to you.

2:25:38.588 --> 2:25:40.588
-You got five minutes.
-Okay.

2:25:42.840 --> 2:25:44.168
Here. Here.

2:25:44.168 --> 2:25:48.042
Linda states that some of
Darlene's closest friends are Leigh,

2:25:48.042 --> 2:25:51.126
who used to bring Darlene
presents from Tijuana.

2:25:51.126 --> 2:25:53.126
-So what?
-He knew her.

2:25:53.126 --> 2:25:54.924
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2:25:54.924 --> 2:25:57.462
No. That's just one name in a file
that contains hundreds.

2:25:57.462 --> 2:25:58.924
It's nothing.

2:25:59.672 --> 2:26:01.882
-Dave Toschi...
-Agrees with me.

2:26:02.378 --> 2:26:05.252
Our investigation
into this subject is over.

2:26:08.252 --> 2:26:09.546
I'm sorry.

2:26:18.672 --> 2:26:19.840
Hello.

2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:36.420
Who's there?

2:26:39.882 --> 2:26:43.462
-You didn't return my calls.
-Oh, I've been kind of busy.

2:26:43.462 --> 2:26:45.336
Yeah. I can see that.

2:26:47.546 --> 2:26:49.420
How's the book coming?

2:26:52.462 --> 2:26:54.462
I tried to send you these.

2:26:55.546 --> 2:26:57.420
I called the Chron.

2:26:57.420 --> 2:27:00.210
Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so...

2:27:01.756 --> 2:27:03.000
I heard.

2:27:08.126 --> 2:27:10.756
When's the last time
you ate something?

2:27:13.252 --> 2:27:15.420
Nothing makes sense anymore.

2:27:18.084 --> 2:27:20.378
-Did it ever?
-Yeah, it did.

2:27:21.840 --> 2:27:24.798
Robert, it was just the date
that didn't end.

2:27:25.252 --> 2:27:27.042
You don't mean that.

2:27:28.462 --> 2:27:29.672
A little.

2:27:32.546 --> 2:27:34.420
The kids miss you.

2:27:34.420 --> 2:27:37.546
-I can't have them see me like this.
-Neither can I.

2:27:38.294 --> 2:27:40.420
So, do whatever you have to,

2:27:41.378 --> 2:27:42.924
but finish this.

2:28:10.462 --> 2:28:11.546
Dave!

2:28:12.420 --> 2:28:14.042
Dave! It's Robert!

2:28:16.210 --> 2:28:17.924
-Dave!
-Is he actually here?

2:28:17.924 --> 2:28:19.672
I'm gonna kill him.

2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.630
I'm calling SFPD. Where's my gun?

2:28:25.168 --> 2:28:26.420
Dave!

2:28:26.420 --> 2:28:28.252
Robert! Go away!

2:28:28.252 --> 2:28:30.336
Dave! He made a mistake!

2:28:30.336 --> 2:28:32.378
-Get away from the window.
-I'll meet you around front.

2:28:32.378 --> 2:28:33.882
No, you won't.

2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.336
-You have to hear this!
-No, I don't, Robert!

2:28:37.336 --> 2:28:39.882
The birthday was the one time
that he was weak!

2:28:39.882 --> 2:28:41.798
The one time
that he gave something away!

2:28:41.798 --> 2:28:45.126
-Robert, I am calling the police.
-It's Arthur Leigh Allen!

2:28:50.126 --> 2:28:52.504
Where did you get that name?

2:28:52.504 --> 2:28:54.126
He called the Bellis' house.

2:28:54.126 --> 2:28:56.462
December '69.
"I need to kill. Today's my birthday."

2:28:56.462 --> 2:28:58.546
It was his birthday.

2:28:58.546 --> 2:29:01.462
Arthur Leigh Allen
was born on December 18th.

2:29:04.504 --> 2:29:05.924
Get in here.

2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.210
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

2:29:13.168 --> 2:29:15.042
He wrote me, you know?

2:29:15.714 --> 2:29:16.924
2,500 suspects,

2:29:16.924 --> 2:29:20.546
the only one who ever wrote me
a letter was Leigh Allen.

2:29:21.420 --> 2:29:23.252
They like to help, you know, sometimes.

2:29:23.252 --> 2:29:25.042
Yes, Robert, I know.

2:29:26.126 --> 2:29:28.966
He was arrested January 1975
for molestation.

2:29:28.966 --> 2:29:30.966
He sent me that when he got out.

2:29:30.966 --> 2:29:33.798
"Dear Dave, if I can ever be
of any help to you, just let me know.

2:29:33.798 --> 2:29:35.714
"I'm sorry I wasn't your man."

2:29:35.714 --> 2:29:37.378
And it's typewritten.

2:29:37.378 --> 2:29:39.798
Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2:29:41.210 --> 2:29:43.000
And he knew Darlene.

2:29:44.378 --> 2:29:46.420
It's in the Vallejo files.

2:29:51.588 --> 2:29:55.042
Mulanax said that
he was your favorite suspect.

2:29:55.042 --> 2:29:59.042
That you spent two years on him,
and that nobody ever came close.

2:30:02.084 --> 2:30:04.084
All the evidence said no.

2:30:05.336 --> 2:30:07.672
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.

2:30:07.672 --> 2:30:10.840
The same Sherwood
that drinks like Paul Avery now?

2:30:11.714 --> 2:30:13.756
Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill
in writing saying,

2:30:13.756 --> 2:30:14.882
"I'm sorry, this just won't work."

2:30:14.882 --> 2:30:16.756
-But you also have Terry Pascoe...
-His protégé.

2:30:16.756 --> 2:30:17.882
Yeah, fine, it's his protégé,

2:30:17.882 --> 2:30:19.840
but he's a handwriting expert
nonetheless, and he's saying,

2:30:19.840 --> 2:30:22.630
"Do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting."

2:30:22.630 --> 2:30:24.672
-So the two cancel each other out.
-No, they don't.

2:30:24.672 --> 2:30:26.042
It was Sherwood's case.

2:30:26.084 --> 2:30:27.630
He was the head
of Questioned Documents.

2:30:27.630 --> 2:30:29.084
If it went to trial,

2:30:29.084 --> 2:30:32.126
all the defense would have to do
is call Sherwood to the stand.

2:30:32.126 --> 2:30:34.882
And there was no way of getting Allen
into court in the first place,

2:30:34.882 --> 2:30:36.210
because there was no evidence, Robert.

2:30:36.210 --> 2:30:37.462
What do you mean,
there's no evidence?

2:30:37.462 --> 2:30:38.672
You have him seen with the ciphers.

2:30:38.672 --> 2:30:41.000
The military boot prints.
The same size shoes and gloves.

2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:43.294
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>
The Zodiac watch.

2:30:43.336 --> 2:30:44.630
The background with school children.

2:30:44.630 --> 2:30:46.546
The misspellings of Christ-mass.
The bloody knives.

2:30:46.546 --> 2:30:48.504
All circumstantial.

2:30:48.504 --> 2:30:51.378
Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.

2:30:51.378 --> 2:30:53.210
We should have found
one of those things in that trailer.

2:30:53.210 --> 2:30:54.966
-We didn't.
-That's...

2:30:57.378 --> 2:30:59.462
Okay. Catherine Allen states that

2:30:59.462 --> 2:31:01.714
"Leigh cleaned out his trailer
on Friday after work

2:31:01.714 --> 2:31:05.462
"and moved it to Santa Rosa
on Saturday, August 7th, 1971."

2:31:05.462 --> 2:31:07.588
You interviewed him
at the refinery on August 4th.

2:31:07.588 --> 2:31:09.210
-Yeah.
-So, he's cleaning out his trailer,

2:31:09.210 --> 2:31:13.084
he's moving into a different county
48 hours after you interviewed him?

2:31:14.630 --> 2:31:17.756
Okay. Okay.
Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.

2:31:17.756 --> 2:31:18.966
All right.

2:31:18.966 --> 2:31:21.840
Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen
and the Zodiac, their timelines.

2:31:21.840 --> 2:31:24.630
-When was the first murder in Vallejo?
-Christmas, 1968.

2:31:24.630 --> 2:31:27.336
Eight months before that,
Allen is fired for molesting his students

2:31:27.336 --> 2:31:29.546
and his family discovers
that he's a pedophile.

2:31:29.546 --> 2:31:31.924
-Now, when do the letters begin?
-July, '69.

2:31:31.924 --> 2:31:33.714
After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

2:31:33.714 --> 2:31:36.882
And they continue
until you go to see him at work.

2:31:36.882 --> 2:31:40.210
Now, after that, do any of the letters
contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?

2:31:40.210 --> 2:31:42.126
No. Because he dumped them,
because he got scared.

2:31:42.126 --> 2:31:43.966
Because he knew
that you were on to him.

2:31:43.966 --> 2:31:47.798
-So, when's the next letter from Zodiac?
-Not until January of 1974.

2:31:47.798 --> 2:31:49.294
He is silent for three years.

2:31:49.294 --> 2:31:51.168
Then, in '74, he feels comfortable again

2:31:51.168 --> 2:31:53.168
because everybody's moved off
Allen as a suspect.

2:31:53.168 --> 2:31:54.252
And what do we get?

2:31:54.252 --> 2:31:58.378
Three new letters from Zodiac
in January, May, and July in '74.

2:31:58.378 --> 2:32:01.504
-But then the letters stop.
-What happens to Allen?

2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:06.504
He's arrested.

2:32:07.420 --> 2:32:10.840
January, 1975,
they send him to Atascadero.

2:32:10.840 --> 2:32:13.840
We don't get another letter from Zodiac
the entire time he's there.

2:32:13.840 --> 2:32:16.588
-When is he released?
-August, '77.

2:32:16.588 --> 2:32:20.420
Allen gets out. He types you an apology,
and then what?

2:32:20.420 --> 2:32:23.630
We get our first new Zodiac letter
in four years.

2:32:29.210 --> 2:32:32.714
Okay. Zodiac had to have known
Darlene Ferrin, right?

2:32:32.714 --> 2:32:35.042
Yes, because of the phone calls
on the night of her murder.

2:32:35.042 --> 2:32:37.924
Because of the Vallejo file,

2:32:37.924 --> 2:32:40.042
we know that Darlene knew
a man named Leigh?

2:32:40.042 --> 2:32:41.126
Yes.

2:32:41.126 --> 2:32:43.000
So, all coincidence aside, Robert,

2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:45.924
how can you be sure that Leigh Allen
is the Leigh from this file?

2:32:45.924 --> 2:32:48.462
Now, Vallejo is a small town,
but it's not that small.

2:32:48.462 --> 2:32:49.882
How do you put
the two of them together?

2:32:49.882 --> 2:32:53.126
This is a case that's covered
both Northern and Southern California,

2:32:53.126 --> 2:32:55.630
with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles.

2:32:55.630 --> 2:32:57.378
-Would you agree?
-Yes.

2:32:58.630 --> 2:33:01.504
Darlene Ferrin worked
at the Vallejo House of Pancakes

2:33:01.504 --> 2:33:04.042
on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll.

2:33:06.882 --> 2:33:11.630
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his
mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2:33:13.336 --> 2:33:16.756
Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.

2:33:20.126 --> 2:33:21.630
Is that true?

2:33:22.630 --> 2:33:24.168
I've walked it.

2:33:27.966 --> 2:33:29.462
Jesus Christ.

2:33:36.126 --> 2:33:37.126
So?

2:33:41.042 --> 2:33:42.714
The prints, the handwriting...

2:33:42.714 --> 2:33:45.714
-I'm not asking you as a cop.
-But I am a cop.

2:33:48.588 --> 2:33:50.714
I can't prove this.

2:33:50.714 --> 2:33:53.756
Just because you can't prove it,
doesn't mean it's not true.

2:33:53.756 --> 2:33:55.420
Easy, Dirty Harry.

2:33:58.966 --> 2:34:00.546
Finish the book.

2:34:09.462 --> 2:34:11.966
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2:35:20.210 --> 2:35:21.714
Can I help you?

2:35:23.378 --> 2:35:24.378
No.

2:36:45.756 --> 2:36:47.126
Mr. Mageau.

2:36:47.798 --> 2:36:50.168
Thanks for coming to see me.

2:36:50.168 --> 2:36:51.630
You're the one I talked to on the phone?

2:36:51.630 --> 2:36:55.168
I'm George Bawart. Vallejo PD.
I took over for Jack Mulanax.

2:36:56.168 --> 2:36:59.252
It's been 22 years.
I don't know how I can help you.

2:36:59.252 --> 2:37:00.546
Well, this is just a formality.

2:37:00.546 --> 2:37:02.042
I'm gonna show you
a group of photographs.

2:37:02.042 --> 2:37:04.000
Now, the person that shot you
may or may not be

2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:06.126
among these photographs.

2:37:06.126 --> 2:37:07.420
You don't have to pick anybody out

2:37:07.420 --> 2:37:09.714
just because I'm showing you
these pictures, you understand?

2:37:09.714 --> 2:37:11.252
Yes, sir, I do.

2:37:12.126 --> 2:37:13.504
All right.

2:37:14.504 --> 2:37:16.042
Take your time.

2:37:16.504 --> 2:37:19.336
If you don't recognize anyone,
that's okay.

2:37:30.798 --> 2:37:32.168
That's him.

2:37:33.630 --> 2:37:35.672
How sure are you?

2:37:35.672 --> 2:37:37.546
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2:37:40.210 --> 2:37:41.420
He had a round face like this guy.

2:37:41.420 --> 2:37:42.756
Wait. Am I to understand

2:37:42.756 --> 2:37:44.588
that you're now identifying
the second photograph?

2:37:44.588 --> 2:37:47.714
No, no. Just that
he had a round face like that.

2:37:49.756 --> 2:37:51.252
It's this man.

2:37:52.126 --> 2:37:53.462
All right.

2:37:55.294 --> 2:37:58.378
Now, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being positive,

2:38:02.462 --> 2:38:04.084
how sure are you?

2:38:07.840 --> 2:38:09.504
At least an eight.

2:38:12.252 --> 2:38:16.126
The last time I saw this face
was July 4th, 1969.

2:38:19.378 --> 2:38:22.084
I am very sure
that's the man who shot me.
