WEBVTT

00:04.070 --> 00:07.373
Man: I've lived in
Washington, D.C., for 20 years.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.976
It's where I met Dean,
playing pick-up basketball,

00:10.043 --> 00:11.644
And made a life
for myself.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.682
But no matter how long
you've been away from home

00:16.750 --> 00:19.418
Or how much you've changed,
the place where you were

00:19.486 --> 00:22.822
Born and raised always stays
somewhere deep inside.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.790
For me, that place
was Oil City,

00:24.858 --> 00:26.926
A small town
with small-town values

00:26.994 --> 00:29.428
In the hills
of western Pennsylvania.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:44.144 --> 00:47.346
I was the youngest
in a big irish catholic family.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.081
Mom was a nurse,
and dad was

00:49.149 --> 00:51.484
Custodian at the catholic
school we all attended.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.453
We didn't have much money,
but life was good,

00:54.521 --> 00:58.224
And I didn't have a care
in the world.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.727
As I got older, I started
to feel different.

01:01.795 --> 01:05.397
By the time I was a teen,
I knew I was gay.

01:05.465 --> 01:09.268
Terrified of losing my friends
and maybe even my family,

01:09.336 --> 01:10.603
I kept silent

01:10.671 --> 01:13.539
And managed to get by.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.374
As soon as I graduated
high school,

01:15.442 --> 01:17.043
I got out of town.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.778
I went off to college,

01:18.845 --> 01:21.380
Joined the Peace Corps,
and found myself

01:21.448 --> 01:23.549
Identifying with others who had
been silenced.

01:23.617 --> 01:27.987
I ended up in Washington, D.C.

01:28.055 --> 01:30.089
When Dean and I fell in love
and got married,

01:30.157 --> 01:31.624
I decided to do
what I wish

01:31.692 --> 01:33.793
I could have done
a long time ago --

01:33.860 --> 01:37.163
Be open about who I was
back in my hometown.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.032
I put our wedding announcement
in the Oil City paper,

01:40.100 --> 01:42.001
The <i>Derrick.</i>

01:42.069 --> 01:43.202
It didn't take long

01:43.270 --> 01:45.738
For the letters
to start pouring in.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.573
Woman:
"Editor: Common sense tells us

01:47.641 --> 01:49.508
Marriage is between
a man and a woman."

01:49.576 --> 01:51.744
Man: "I am shaking with anger
as I write this."

01:51.812 --> 01:53.779
Woman:
"I was sick to my stomach

01:53.847 --> 01:56.215
When I saw and read
the announcement..."

01:56.283 --> 01:59.585
Man:
"Homosexuality is immoral."

01:59.653 --> 02:01.921
Man: "It would be better
for you not to have been born.

02:01.989 --> 02:05.224
Think about that."

02:05.292 --> 02:06.892
The reactions
to my wedding announcement

02:06.960 --> 02:10.196
Were discouraging, but they
didn't really surprise me.

02:10.263 --> 02:12.932
Then I got a letter
I didn't expect.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.136
"Dear Mr. Wilson,
I searched

02:17.204 --> 02:18.904
"for your address
in Washington, D.C.,

02:18.972 --> 02:21.607
"after I saw your wedding
announcement in the paper.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.909
"I'm the mother
of a 16-year-old boy

02:23.977 --> 02:26.846
"who is being treated unjustly
because he is gay.

02:26.913 --> 02:30.182
"I was told you were
born and raised in Oil City,

02:30.250 --> 02:32.385
"so I feel
a connection to you.

02:32.452 --> 02:35.454
"Last night, my son,
C.J., cried for three hours

02:35.522 --> 02:39.125
"after being abused in public
because of being gay.

02:39.192 --> 02:41.060
"I'm so afraid for him.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.129
"I don't know where else
to turn.

02:43.196 --> 02:45.364
"Please help if you can.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.833
Sincerely,
Kathy Springer."

02:47.901 --> 02:50.503
Kathy's letter
made me realize

02:50.570 --> 02:52.938
That the controversy
about our wedding announcement

02:53.006 --> 02:54.373
Wasn't just
about gay marriage.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.042
It was about
the very existence

02:56.109 --> 02:58.010
Of openly gay people
in Oil City.

02:58.078 --> 03:02.048
Here it was, 25 years after
my own fear of being found out

03:02.115 --> 03:05.451
Forced me to live in silence,
and it didn't seem

03:05.519 --> 03:08.521
To be any easier
to be gay in my hometown.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.589
I wanted to go back
to Oil City and see

03:10.657 --> 03:13.159
If there was anything
Dean and I could do to help.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.660
Documenting people's stories

03:14.728 --> 03:16.629
Seemed like a good place
to start.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.397
So I asked Dean
to grab the camera.

03:18.465 --> 03:23.002
♫ I dreamed of fires burning ♫

03:23.070 --> 03:24.070
♫ low ♫

03:24.137 --> 03:26.172
♫ in my head ♫

03:26.239 --> 03:27.940
♫ on a map below ♫

03:28.008 --> 03:31.210
♫ like an old friend ♫

03:31.278 --> 03:33.913
♫ that I used to know ♫

03:33.980 --> 03:37.416
♫ I've got seven hours ♫

03:37.484 --> 03:40.853
♫ and 15 miles to go ♫

03:40.921 --> 03:42.822
♫ instead ♫

03:42.889 --> 03:45.057
♫ and ain't it good ♫

03:45.125 --> 03:49.862
♫ to be back home? ♫

03:53.767 --> 03:56.936
Young man:
This was my school.

03:57.003 --> 03:59.472
Every day when the bus stopped

03:59.539 --> 04:03.209
And I walked through that door
to my locker

04:03.276 --> 04:05.878
Became eight hours
of pure hell.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.986
Wilson:
What went on in there?

04:14.054 --> 04:16.822
Well, kids would come by,
hit me with my locker,

04:16.890 --> 04:18.190
I'd fall on the ground,

04:18.257 --> 04:20.326
My books
would fly everywhere.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.628
I was slammed
into the lockers,

04:22.696 --> 04:25.397
Hit with stuff,
being yelled, "faggot."

04:25.465 --> 04:28.868
Yep.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.506
This hall
was always lovely.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.641
I'd have to walk
through a crowd

04:35.709 --> 04:38.844
of kids, and there would
always definitely be

04:38.912 --> 04:42.081
some tripping going on
or shoving or pushing.

04:42.149 --> 04:45.151
Grab my backpack
and yanking me,

04:45.218 --> 04:46.819
And stupid stuff.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.020
What did you feel inside

04:48.088 --> 04:49.989
When that kind of stuff
was happening?

04:50.056 --> 04:51.824
Terrified.
Nobody cared.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.159
None of the teachers
cared.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.693
None of
the administrators cared.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.495
They always gave
a deaf ear

04:56.563 --> 04:57.863
And a blind eye.

04:57.931 --> 05:01.333
They'd watch everything,
never say a word.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.505
Wilson:
I wanted to understand

05:06.573 --> 05:09.742
What was behind the anti-gay
sentiment in the area.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.011
It seemed like
talking with people

05:12.078 --> 05:14.046
Who denounced our wedding
announcement in the paper

05:14.114 --> 05:15.514
Would be a logical place
to start.

05:15.582 --> 05:19.351
Only one couple
agreed to be interviewed --

05:19.419 --> 05:21.453
Pastor Mark Micklos
and his wife, Diana.

05:21.521 --> 05:25.157
If I grant two men
the right to get married,

05:25.225 --> 05:27.960
What's wrong with incest?

05:28.028 --> 05:30.362
Or polygamy or --
and it would just,

05:30.430 --> 05:32.965
Just expand,
and I think that things --

05:33.033 --> 05:35.434
I think at times
we've seen that happen.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.403
In plumbing,
there's fittings,

05:37.470 --> 05:40.072
and they're called
male and female fittings.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.842
And you could probably

05:42.909 --> 05:45.778
plumb a house
with all male fittings,

05:45.846 --> 05:50.749
but it seems like the design
is for male and female.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.285
Not for two likes
to be together.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.655
It was hard to listen to what
the Micklosses were saying,

05:56.723 --> 05:59.058
But the fact that they
invited us to their home

05:59.125 --> 06:01.293
and we were talking
seemed like an opening.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.295
When I asked them why
they had taken the trouble

06:03.363 --> 06:05.030
to write about
our wedding announcement,

06:05.098 --> 06:07.633
they told me that their church
had received an alert

06:07.701 --> 06:09.668
that asked members
to write in protest.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.971
It was sent
by the Pennsylvania arm

06:12.038 --> 06:14.840
Of the American Family
Association,

06:14.908 --> 06:16.775
A conservative values
organization

06:16.843 --> 06:17.943
based in Mississippi.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.278
How did they key in

06:19.346 --> 06:21.881
on our little wedding
announcement so fast?

06:21.948 --> 06:24.450
It turns out that the AFA's
chapter president,

06:24.517 --> 06:26.952
Diane Gramley,
lives right there in the area

06:27.020 --> 06:29.388
and has a program
on a local radio station.

06:29.456 --> 06:33.025
<i>[ music plays ]</i>

06:33.093 --> 06:34.326

07:11.631 --> 07:13.699
Wilson: Back when
I was growing up,

07:13.767 --> 07:16.335
People didn't talk about
lifestyle so openly.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.903
And at my house,

07:17.971 --> 07:21.140
sexuality or being gay
wasn't discussed at all.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.841
Even though right on our street,

07:22.909 --> 07:24.843
just two doors down
from our house,

07:24.911 --> 07:27.780
we had a neighbor with
a rainbow flag on her door.

07:27.847 --> 07:30.182
Woman: I've lived
in this community

07:30.250 --> 07:33.252
since I was 17 years old,
and I've always been open.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.454
I mean, I never wore
my sexuality on a sleeve,

07:35.522 --> 07:37.122
but people always
knew who I was.

07:37.190 --> 07:41.293
Nobody was ever negative to me,
except one occasion.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.595
I was hired at this firm,

07:43.663 --> 07:45.731
and I worked there
about six months,

07:45.799 --> 07:47.933
and then the president
of the company,

07:48.001 --> 07:50.869
after the Christmas party --
and I took my partner --

07:50.937 --> 07:53.105
came in a few days later
and fired me.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.773
Said he couldn't have the likes

07:54.841 --> 07:56.675
of somebody like me
working for the company.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.377
Okay.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.546
Be good, you guys.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.715
Come here.
Come on.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.219
This is my house

08:07.287 --> 08:10.089
where my stepdad
sells smelly birds.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.691
Wilson: <i>"choo-kers?"</i>
<i>chukars or something like that?</i>
<i>Chukars.</i>

08:12.759 --> 08:15.427
Chukars, quails,
and pheasants.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.096
Probably stinks.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.430
Yeah, it stinks.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.934
Okay, the smell is
a little too much.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.803
Okay, it's a little
too real.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.940
That is not a place for --

08:28.008 --> 08:31.076
Bills: The first day we came
back from Christmas vacation,

08:31.144 --> 08:32.544
this kid, Richie,,

08:32.611 --> 08:35.179
who everybody's known
he was gay since, like,

08:35.248 --> 08:37.616
the day he was born,
came back to school.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.519
And I went into
my history class,

08:40.587 --> 08:42.453
last period of the day,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.957
and some kid stood up
and came over to him --

08:45.025 --> 08:46.959
'cause he was
standing by the door

08:47.027 --> 08:49.528
'cause he didn't have
a seat or anything yet --

08:49.596 --> 08:52.131
and some kid was like,
"hey, are you a faggot?"

08:52.198 --> 08:53.799
And I stood up,
and I got in his face,

08:53.867 --> 08:55.567
and I was like,
"why you got to call him that?

08:55.635 --> 08:56.902
"What did he do to you?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.804
"he's just standing there,
hasn't said a word to anybody.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.105
Leave him alone."

09:00.173 --> 09:03.042
And he's like, "What? So are
you a hard-ass homo then?"

09:03.109 --> 09:05.244
He's like, "You think
you can take me?"

09:05.311 --> 09:06.945
And I was like, "Dude,
I might be a faggot,

09:07.013 --> 09:08.480
but I'm more of a man
than you'll be."

09:08.548 --> 09:10.082
And he's like,
"So you're admitting it?"

09:10.150 --> 09:11.417
And I was like,
"I am admitting

09:11.484 --> 09:13.419
"that if you say another
word to me like that again,

09:13.486 --> 09:14.853
I am going to take
your teeth out."

09:14.921 --> 09:16.889
There was a lot he
didn't even tell me,

09:16.956 --> 09:18.390
you know, at first,

09:18.458 --> 09:19.925
because he'd come home,

09:19.993 --> 09:21.693
and he'd be real quiet,
and he'd go to his room,

09:21.761 --> 09:24.096
and he wouldn't
come out for hours.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.931
I said, "You know, c.J.,

09:25.999 --> 09:29.601
"there is nothing you could
possibly be in this world

09:29.669 --> 09:32.538
that would ever make
me stop loving you."

09:32.605 --> 09:36.408
So then, finally,
one day, he says,

09:36.476 --> 09:39.144
"I'm tired of denying
who I am,

09:39.212 --> 09:41.547
"and I'm tired
of the abuse

09:41.614 --> 09:44.516
"and the harassment
that gays take,

09:44.584 --> 09:46.452
"and I'm just
coming out with it.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.120
I don't care."

09:48.188 --> 09:50.022
Wilson: Kathy had mentioned
on the phone that c.J.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.990
wanted to make videos himself,
so we gave him a camera

09:52.058 --> 09:54.460
and helped him get started
by filming one of his friends.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.028
Hamer: And if you want
a close-up,

09:56.096 --> 09:57.563
you go like that.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.164
Oops. Or whatever.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.400
And if you want far away,
you go like that.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.902
So you try it.
Film something.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.170
That's awesome.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.673
I was hoping c.J.
Would use his new camera

10:07.740 --> 10:09.274
to shine some light

10:09.342 --> 10:12.010
on what life was like
for him as a gay teen.

10:12.078 --> 10:14.613
For practice, I asked him
to join us at a concert

10:14.681 --> 10:17.683
I helped to organize
featuring Namoli Brennet.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.785
Namoli's a transgendered
musician.

10:19.853 --> 10:23.122
She's also from a small town
and lives her life very openly.

10:23.189 --> 10:26.158
Maybe it was
the activist in me,

10:26.226 --> 10:27.860
but I thought she might
be an inspiration

10:27.927 --> 10:29.294
for folks in Oil City.

Wilson: Oil City became
a real boomtown back in 1859

10:43.343 --> 10:45.677
when colonel Edwin Drake

10:45.745 --> 10:48.080
drilled the first oil well
in the United States.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.550
The area had about 100 years of
growth and prosperity,

10:51.618 --> 10:54.987
but by the time I came along,
the wells had dried up,

10:55.054 --> 10:57.689
and jobs and people
were moving out.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.825
It had become the sort
of rust belt town

10:59.893 --> 11:01.860
that time seemed
to be leaving behind,

11:01.928 --> 11:03.529
Where things didn't change much

11:03.596 --> 11:05.531
and outsiders were viewed
with suspicion.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.700
Like many small towns,

11:08.768 --> 11:10.903
Oil City is trying
to make a comeback.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.571
If it can figure out

11:12.639 --> 11:14.473
how to use
its small-town spirt

11:14.541 --> 11:16.608
to make everyone
feel welcome there,

11:16.676 --> 11:18.677
it just might happen.

Brennet: ♫ I can be ♫

Wilson: The biggest event
of the year in Oil City

11:44.671 --> 11:46.505
is the oil heritage parade.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.407
Most people come out
to watch their kids March

11:48.474 --> 11:50.242
or their friends ride around
silly floats.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.345
Even in the pouring rain.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.448
So I wasn't expecting to see
an anti-gay marriage protest

11:56.516 --> 11:58.550
led by none other
than Diane Gramley

11:58.618 --> 12:00.619
of the American
Family Association.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.454
She'd already refused
several requests

12:02.522 --> 12:04.022
to be formally interviewed,

12:04.090 --> 12:05.857
so I tried a more
direct approach.

12:05.925 --> 12:07.392
Hi, Diane.
How are you?

12:07.460 --> 12:08.627
Fine, and you?

12:08.695 --> 12:10.829
I'm not going to be part
of your documentary.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.698
Yeah, we just wanted
to know why

12:12.765 --> 12:14.199
You're so actively seeking

12:14.267 --> 12:16.668
to discriminate against
gay and lesbian people.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.437
We talked about it
on the phone.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.105
Well, why do you think
that they don't deserve

12:20.173 --> 12:23.709
to live freely
in society as you do?

12:23.776 --> 12:25.644
They have every right
to live freely,

12:25.712 --> 12:27.613
and they are living
freely in society.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.881
I would like to know why
you encourage children

12:29.949 --> 12:31.883
to participate in
a dangerous lifestyle.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.352
Hey, Joe,
how you doing?

12:33.419 --> 12:35.020
Good, and you?
Nice to see you.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.688
Good seeing you.
Yeah.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.390
Gramley: There've been
homosexuals throughout society,

12:38.458 --> 12:39.725
but they have not attempted

12:39.792 --> 12:42.427
to redefine marriage
and family as they are today.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.196
Everything else with gay
people is okay, right?

12:44.264 --> 12:45.731
They can teach school.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.733
If they have a job,
and they're doing their job,

12:47.800 --> 12:49.434
they have every right
to have that job.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.303
And they could be out on
the job and tell people

12:51.371 --> 12:52.771
that they're gay
when they're asked?

12:52.839 --> 12:55.974
No, 'cause that's
promoting a lifestyle.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.480
Well, I know that.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.286
Wilson: Things had
become increasingly bad

13:07.353 --> 13:09.187
at c.J.'s high school.

13:09.255 --> 13:12.157
When he finally complained about
the abuse he was receiving,

13:12.225 --> 13:14.693
the assistant principal
blamed him for the trouble

13:14.761 --> 13:16.395
and called the State Police.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.764
Kathy decided to take c.J.
out of school

13:18.831 --> 13:21.099
and go to the school board
for answers.

going to implement

13:46.225 --> 13:49.394
a change in how
discrimination is handled

13:49.462 --> 13:51.430
in this school district?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.632
I recently had
to pull my son out

13:53.700 --> 13:56.635
because of discrimination
and how it was handled.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.905
Are you -- is there a better
way of handling things?

13:59.972 --> 14:02.674

Will you give me a call?

14:02.742 --> 14:05.577
Okay? This isn't
the time to --

14:05.645 --> 14:08.113

wanted to know if --

14:08.181 --> 14:10.782
you know, should I decide
to send my son back?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.884
Are there going
to be any changes?

14:12.952 --> 14:14.386
That's all.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.688
There have been
discussions taking place,

14:16.723 --> 14:18.523
and there
have been issues

14:18.591 --> 14:20.992
not only with myself
and Mr. Richmond,

14:21.060 --> 14:23.595
Mr. Forrester,
and the other principals,

14:23.663 --> 14:26.298

if that's --

14:26.366 --> 14:29.434
But, please, feel free
to give me a call, okay?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.603
It was like, "oh, god,

14:31.671 --> 14:35.240
give her her five minutes
and get her out of here."

14:35.308 --> 14:38.877
I really don't see that they've
seen us as a threat or anything.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.712
We were just an annoyance.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.047
Mm-hmm.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.682
Wilson: Shortly after
kathy's appearance,

14:43.750 --> 14:45.917
the school board did
propose a plan

14:45.985 --> 14:48.587
for inclusive
anti-discrimination training.

14:48.654 --> 14:50.989
But there was suddenly
an unusual amount

14:51.057 --> 14:53.024
of opposition from
the community,

14:53.092 --> 14:55.527
especially from
an African-American Pastor

14:55.595 --> 14:58.163
who wanted the training
to focus only on race

14:58.231 --> 15:00.565
and not even mention
sexual orientation.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.367
A <i>Derrick</i> reporter discovered

15:02.435 --> 15:04.603
the reason for
the racial outcry.

15:04.670 --> 15:07.806
Diane Gramley had sent out
another action alert.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.075
This one accused
the school district

15:10.143 --> 15:13.445
of trying to hijack civil rights
to promote homosexuality.

15:13.513 --> 15:17.082
The diversity training
never happened.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.985
I have to admit,
in this environment,

15:20.052 --> 15:21.820
it was a clever strategy

15:21.888 --> 15:24.790
to pit one minority group
against another.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.491
I'll tell you
what we're doing.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.260
We got married
a couple years ago,

15:28.327 --> 15:30.629
and we put our wedding
announcement in the paper,

15:30.696 --> 15:33.265
and it turned into this, like,
controversy or whatever.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.367
I got beat up
about a month ago.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.202

Oh, yeah.

were racist or anything.

wouldn't stop talking crap,

15:44.143 --> 15:47.612

and she ploughed me down.

Henderson: Well,
the cool part about it

the same thing about me.

the world's going on

19:33.706 --> 19:35.407

around smiling a lot.

You know,
all of the sudden,

I have a family now.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.916
Hitchcock: In some ways, she's
the total opposite of me.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.786
You know, I can be aggressive
and antagonistic,

19:47.853 --> 19:50.055
and she's just kind of quiet
and the peacemaker,

19:50.122 --> 19:53.658
and she's just calm.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.828
And she's very gifted.
She's great with people.

She is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

Did you look
at a lot of cars,

I don't think I'll

a reputation and stuff

as a bad-ass

my life consists

21:34.326 --> 21:36.795
Nothing, really.

ever leave this garage.

if we would hear

21:54.046 --> 21:55.580
from Pastor Micklos again,

21:55.648 --> 21:58.583
but when he called to invite us
to lunch with his family,

21:58.651 --> 22:01.186
I thought I'd see
where it would lead.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.588
When you contacted me
or I contacted you

22:03.656 --> 22:05.256
or however it occurred,

22:05.324 --> 22:07.158
one of the things
that I prayed

22:07.226 --> 22:09.527
was that you would
see Christ in us.

22:09.595 --> 22:12.297
I just don't see my life through
a Christian framework.

22:12.364 --> 22:15.333
That's just not how I want
to view the world, you know.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.702
But can we,
at some point though,

22:17.770 --> 22:19.904
get to a point where
we respect that

22:19.972 --> 22:21.573
and respect each other?

22:21.640 --> 22:23.508
Well, no.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.109

22:25.177 --> 22:28.313
I mean, I can respect
your Christian beliefs,

but if

22:30.583 --> 22:32.817
some of those beliefs

22:32.885 --> 22:35.153
are aimed at limiting

22:35.221 --> 22:37.856
other people's full
participation in society,

22:37.923 --> 22:39.924
No, I can't respect that.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.459
I have to struggle
against that.

22:41.527 --> 22:44.996
I can respect
the Mark Micklos that I know

in hopes that he reaches

22:46.565 --> 22:48.466
a higher point
of enlightenment,

22:48.534 --> 22:50.268
and that I would
be his friend,

through that process.

your first thought

23:05.551 --> 23:07.719
when I first came out?

23:07.786 --> 23:10.989
My first reaction
was probably...

23:11.056 --> 23:12.657
I was probably shocked.

23:12.725 --> 23:13.992
Why?

Just because --

You have to ask me
a question.

How did you feel when
Richie first came out?

23:29.942 --> 23:31.542
I was happy
for him and stuff.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.278
You know, I was happy
for you, too,

23:33.345 --> 23:34.712
'cause you finally
came out.

23:34.780 --> 23:37.181

if you're gay,

23:37.249 --> 23:40.251
you've always been gay,
but you finally came out,

23:40.319 --> 23:42.920
so I don't know,
I was just happy for you.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.957
I could never

23:46.025 --> 23:48.126
deny who I am.

23:48.193 --> 23:50.895
I couldn't deny it.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.630
I was trying to find
ways around it,

23:52.698 --> 23:54.499
but people kept
directing the question,

23:54.566 --> 23:56.601
"are you gay?" to my face.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.470
I didn't know what to say,
but I couldn't deny who I was,

23:59.538 --> 24:01.239
so I ended up having --

24:01.307 --> 24:05.643
I ended up saying that,
"you know what, yeah.

24:05.711 --> 24:09.747
So what is it to you?
Big deal."

24:09.815 --> 24:14.185
And I guess it was
a big deal to everybody.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.155
I know that everybody cared
because at that day,

24:17.222 --> 24:18.923

rather phenomenal,

chandelier is here --

24:57.196 --> 24:58.596
You gotta go see it."

She loaned me this tiny, little
itty-bitty flashlight,

25:01.934 --> 25:04.535

and the door was unlocked.

25:04.603 --> 25:06.704
The room was dark,
and I came in,

25:06.772 --> 25:09.941

just went pitter-patter.

like that was here in Oil City.

Henderson: No,
that's probably okay.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.787
That's my chainsaw,

29:49.855 --> 29:50.821

Wilson: Another case
of anti-gay discrimination

30:48.980 --> 30:51.782
had taken place several years
earlier in Titusville,

30:51.850 --> 30:54.652
a town just up the road
from Oil City.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.121
It involved a student
named Tim Dahle.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.989
I thought he and his family
might be able

30:59.057 --> 31:00.624
to help Kathy and C.J.
figure out

31:00.692 --> 31:03.260
how to get their school district
to take them more seriously.

31:03.328 --> 31:04.495
Bills: The whole thing
started

31:04.563 --> 31:06.197
from me standing up
for one kid.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.365
And no one ever,

31:07.432 --> 31:09.467
ever once said
a word to anybody.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.102
They just stood there,

31:12.337 --> 31:14.004
since I was this big.

31:14.072 --> 31:15.773

their eyes.

and then

all of a sudden,
they turn on you.

31:19.277 --> 31:21.145
I've been there.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.681
What really irritates me
is the fact

31:23.749 --> 31:26.050
that I used to
go out of my way

31:26.118 --> 31:30.621
to actually cause bodily harm
to gay people.

31:30.689 --> 31:34.392
Okay, we used to use it
like a sport, you know?

31:34.459 --> 31:36.227
I mean, it was stupid.

31:36.294 --> 31:37.862
And then when you
came out of the closet

31:37.929 --> 31:39.997
and told me that you were gay,
I thought,

31:40.065 --> 31:41.699
"oh, no, no, no.
You can't be."

31:41.767 --> 31:43.200
And I got to thinking,

31:43.268 --> 31:45.236
that gay kid's yours.

31:45.303 --> 31:47.004
You going to disown him

31:47.072 --> 31:49.740

sexual orientation?

31:49.808 --> 31:52.476
Or are you going to love him
for who he is inside?

31:52.544 --> 31:53.978
And I thought,
"the hell with it.

31:54.045 --> 31:55.846
I'm going to love him
for who he is inside."

got to learn how to live with,

32:06.591 --> 32:09.026

got to be sincere.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.194

32:28.113 --> 32:29.346
Wilson:
It seemed like Kathy

32:29.414 --> 32:30.815
really perked up
when Diane told her

32:30.882 --> 32:33.150
that their lawsuit had forced
the school district

32:33.218 --> 32:34.618
to implement diversity training

32:34.686 --> 32:36.320
that included
sexual orientation.

32:36.388 --> 32:37.755
Diane: We were
the first people

32:37.823 --> 32:38.989
in all these years

32:39.057 --> 32:41.258
to stand up
to our school system.

32:41.326 --> 32:43.861
And it was because what they
were doing was wrong.

32:43.929 --> 32:44.995
Yeah.

32:45.063 --> 32:46.430
Springer: It breaks my heart.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.966
I mean, I could just cry.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.469
And that there are
other kids out there

32:51.536 --> 32:53.737
going through
similar situations --

32:53.805 --> 32:55.639
None of this
should ever happen.

32:55.707 --> 32:58.442
I don't know that I'll
change the world,

32:58.510 --> 33:01.846
but if I can even just
educate a few people, like,

33:01.913 --> 33:05.916
look, they weren't put on this
earth to be tortured like this.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.823
We're getting ready
for the grand opening.

33:12.891 --> 33:14.291
And all of a sudden,

33:14.359 --> 33:17.928
Diane Gramley sent out
a letter

33:17.996 --> 33:22.266
warning everyone about
how dangerous we are and --

33:22.334 --> 33:24.401
we have this
homosexual agenda.

33:24.469 --> 33:26.971
And her brother
goes to work with a guy

33:27.038 --> 33:29.573
whose minister stood
right in the pulpit

33:29.641 --> 33:31.775
and said to boycott
the Latonia.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.777
What?

33:33.845 --> 33:35.045
Where is that
coming from?

33:35.113 --> 33:36.146
Diane Gramley.

33:36.214 --> 33:37.414
She's started
an all-in, all-out

33:37.482 --> 33:39.483
campaign against us.

33:39.551 --> 33:40.985
And she's saying
to people,

33:41.052 --> 33:42.553
"don't do business
with the Latonia"?

33:42.621 --> 33:43.621
Yes.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.222
Because it's run
by a lesbian couple.

33:45.290 --> 33:48.158
Yes -- we just wanted
to have a business.

33:48.226 --> 33:51.061
If all the city wants
is churches,

33:51.129 --> 33:52.530
then what do they need

33:52.597 --> 33:54.331
an Art Deco theater for?

33:58.403 --> 34:00.237
Wilson: As we were dealing
with anti-gay attitudes

34:00.305 --> 34:01.438
right there
in the community,

34:01.506 --> 34:02.973
the state of Pennsylvania

34:03.041 --> 34:06.176
was considering expanding
its anti-discrimination law

34:06.244 --> 34:08.512
to include
sexual orientation.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.214
Kathy was invited
to tell her story

34:10.282 --> 34:12.783
about discrimination at C.J.'s
school at a public hearing.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.784
I'm not a public speaker.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.888
But -- and I don't know
what I'd say.

34:17.956 --> 34:22.326
I just, I need to hear
how it's going and --

34:22.393 --> 34:23.960
Wilson: I've printed out
a copy of the law,

34:24.029 --> 34:25.496
so we can look at it.
Okay, good, good.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.031
Yeah, that would be good.

34:27.098 --> 34:28.799
Where you see
the underline,

34:28.867 --> 34:31.068
it's trying to add
"sexual orientation,

34:31.136 --> 34:33.603
Gender identity,
or expression."

34:33.672 --> 34:35.371
You know,
I don't understand

34:35.440 --> 34:39.643
where they even get off
not including

34:39.710 --> 34:41.612
gay and lesbian.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.246
You know, let's get,

35:24.956 --> 35:27.157
Wilson:
People like Diane

35:27.225 --> 35:29.493
are using misinformation

35:29.561 --> 35:31.996
to stir up irrational fears,
to kind of

35:32.063 --> 35:34.198
push people
back into the closet.

35:34.265 --> 35:35.733
It's not going to happen.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.067
But when they
stir up that fear,

35:37.135 --> 35:38.235
that's what creates
the problems.

35:38.303 --> 35:39.703
That's what puts
people like C.J. at risk.

35:39.771 --> 35:40.738
At risk.
Okay.

35:40.805 --> 35:41.839
Because those messages

35:41.906 --> 35:43.407
go out there and say,
"Oh, those are

35:43.475 --> 35:44.908
the people
we're supposed to hate."

35:44.976 --> 35:46.343
You know, can you imagine,
I mean,

35:46.411 --> 35:49.213
just seeing somebody
at a party and saying,

35:49.280 --> 35:50.748
"Oh, that's the faggot.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.517
"Let's go, you know,
punch him, literally

35:53.585 --> 35:54.585
knock him out --"

35:54.653 --> 35:56.220
Can I imagine that?
Oh, yeah.

35:56.287 --> 35:58.288
I-I <i>can</i> imagine that.

35:58.356 --> 36:03.093
I mean, I was that type
of a person at one time.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.530
Now, that may be shocking
to you.

36:06.598 --> 36:10.067
But in my journey in life,
I'm no longer like that,

36:10.135 --> 36:11.669
And a big part of that

36:11.736 --> 36:14.304
Is my Christianity,
my faith in Christ.

36:14.372 --> 36:17.307
You know, I truly believe
that Jesus Christ

36:17.375 --> 36:21.478
has changed my character,
so that I don't do that,

36:21.546 --> 36:23.080
nor do I want
to do those things anymore.

36:23.148 --> 36:24.882
I mean, those are wrong.
It's wrong to do that.

36:24.949 --> 36:26.216
It's wrong to violate...

36:26.284 --> 36:28.519
You know, anybody.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.688
I became
a different person.

36:30.755 --> 36:33.023
Do you think there will come
a time, though, when we

36:33.091 --> 36:35.926
don't disagree about

36:35.994 --> 36:37.494
the place that gay, lesbian,

36:37.562 --> 36:40.030
bisexual, and trans people
have in the world?

36:40.098 --> 36:43.867
Maybe aspects of it.
I don't know.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.169
I don't know.

36:45.236 --> 36:46.837
You know...

36:46.905 --> 36:50.074
I'd have to...

36:50.141 --> 36:52.176
That would be a big --
that would be

36:52.243 --> 36:54.011
a big change for me,
you know?

36:54.079 --> 36:56.947
Wilson: My interactions
with Pastor Micklos

36:57.015 --> 36:58.849
Were odd.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.350
Ever since
the wedding announcement,

37:00.418 --> 37:02.219
I felt like I had been battling

37:02.287 --> 37:03.987
against people who use religion

37:04.055 --> 37:06.757
to deny gay people basic rights
of visibility.

37:06.825 --> 37:10.360
Pastor Micklos was open
to looking at things

37:10.428 --> 37:11.995
in a different way.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.731
I'd never thought
I'd become friends

37:13.798 --> 37:15.833
with someone who didn't
view me as his equal.

37:15.900 --> 37:19.536
But his willingness to examine
his own beliefs

37:19.604 --> 37:21.939
was helping me to see
that not all religious people

37:22.006 --> 37:24.007
fell into the box
that I often put them in.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.809
Good afternoon, joe,
how are you doing?

37:25.877 --> 37:27.311
Wilson: Hi, Diane,
how are you?

37:27.378 --> 37:29.713
I wanted to introduce you
to Kathy Springer and C.J.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.381
Oh, okay, good,
nice to meet you.

37:31.449 --> 37:33.083
Thank you, it's nice
to meet you.

37:33.151 --> 37:36.720
Wilson: C.J. Is the young boy
who was in Franklin high school

37:36.788 --> 37:39.823
and was experiencing harassment
and discrimination.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.358
Okay, the one that was
on your video?

37:41.426 --> 37:42.960
Wilson: Yeah.
What do you think of that?

37:43.027 --> 37:44.928
Well, I need to get in here
to the meeting, excuse me.

37:49.000 --> 37:49.967
Woman: Diane Gramley

37:50.034 --> 37:52.669
From the American Family
Association

37:52.737 --> 37:54.772
of Pennsylvania.

37:54.839 --> 37:55.906
Gramley: Civil rights
protections

37:55.974 --> 37:56.907
have long
been fought for

37:56.975 --> 37:58.942
by disenfranchised groups
of people.

37:59.010 --> 38:03.080
African Americans led the fight
for civil rights,

38:03.148 --> 38:05.048
seeking the right to vote
and to no longer

38:05.116 --> 38:07.284
be required to sit
at the back of the bus.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.386
But a person's skin color
or national origin

38:09.454 --> 38:10.687
is unchangeable.

38:10.755 --> 38:14.291
Wilson: Again, Gramley was
trying to use race

38:14.359 --> 38:16.360
as a wedge to divide.

38:16.427 --> 38:18.395
But this time, she was dealing
with legislators

38:18.463 --> 38:20.230
who were experienced
in civil rights law.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.300
I was hoping they'd be more open
to Kathy's testimony.

38:23.368 --> 38:24.835
Springer: I'm sorry,
I'm already nervous.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.171
[ laughing ]
I'm not a public speaker.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.573
At this time I'd like
to tell you

38:29.641 --> 38:31.275
about my son,
C.J. Bills.

38:31.342 --> 38:33.343
At the time,
he was 15 years old

38:33.411 --> 38:35.946
and attended a public school
in Venango county.

38:36.014 --> 38:39.349
There was an incident
on a school bus one day.

38:39.417 --> 38:41.185
He was on a field trip.

38:41.252 --> 38:42.786
There were teachers
monitoring

38:42.854 --> 38:44.588
this whole trip.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.023
Kids were throwing things

38:46.090 --> 38:48.058
at him,
calling him "faggot,"

38:48.126 --> 38:50.727
"queer," "gay,"
asking if he wanted

38:50.795 --> 38:52.996
to perform sex acts
on them.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.399
The teachers
just turned their heads

38:55.466 --> 38:57.234
and acted
like it never happened.

38:57.302 --> 38:59.269
We've had our house

38:59.337 --> 39:01.572
threatened to be
burned down.

39:01.639 --> 39:04.408
We've gotten phone calls
by these boys, saying,

39:04.475 --> 39:06.610
"we want to see
what color a faggot bleeds."

39:06.678 --> 39:10.214
He was vulnerable,
he was scared,

39:10.281 --> 39:11.815
he didn't want
to go to school.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.618
His grades were dropping.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.620
He was suicidal.

39:18.389 --> 39:22.059
I, um, I just have
one more thing

39:22.126 --> 39:25.662
to say -- I hope it never
comes to your family,

39:25.730 --> 39:27.998
where one of your children
are tortured

39:28.066 --> 39:29.366
for being who they are.

39:29.434 --> 39:32.636
Thank you.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.605
[ man coughs ]

39:34.672 --> 39:37.608
Sometimes black people
have a problem

39:37.675 --> 39:39.910
with people who are different

39:39.978 --> 39:44.047
comparing their experiences

39:44.115 --> 39:46.550
with the black experience.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.652
Because of
your experience,

39:48.720 --> 39:50.954
you're going to be able
to help other young people

39:51.022 --> 39:54.725
so that maybe tomorrow
this doesn't happen.

39:54.792 --> 39:55.859
God bless you for it.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.695
Be who you are,
no matter what.

39:58.763 --> 39:59.796
Thank you very much.

39:59.864 --> 40:03.367
Springer:
Thank you.

40:07.171 --> 40:08.839
Wilson: Diane and group,
we actually wanted

40:08.907 --> 40:10.307
to ask you how you respond

40:10.375 --> 40:13.010
to the very personal testimonies
of C.J. And Kathy.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.178
Like I said at the beginning
of my testimony,

40:15.246 --> 40:16.847
I thought it was
awful information.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.283
And the Franklin school district
should not have done to him

40:19.350 --> 40:20.350
what they permitted to do.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.418
So will you join us

40:21.486 --> 40:22.953
in fighting discrimination --
No --

40:23.021 --> 40:24.821
Against gay and lesbian
people in Franklin?

40:24.889 --> 40:25.956
Not, we're not going to --

40:26.024 --> 40:27.257
We're not
going to join you.

40:27.325 --> 40:28.425
Why not?
No.

40:28.493 --> 40:32.930
Because of the roads
that that will open.

40:32.997 --> 40:36.333
Wilson: Kathy's testimony
may not have influenced Gramley,

40:36.401 --> 40:38.669
but it did have an impact
on the legislators.

40:38.736 --> 40:40.704
After the hearing,

40:40.772 --> 40:43.874
one of the staff offered to help
Kathy and C.J. Contact the ACLU

40:43.942 --> 40:46.543
to press a legal case
against their school district.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.313
Springer: Prior to this,
I figured, the ACLU --

40:49.380 --> 40:50.414
What the heck?

40:50.481 --> 40:52.049
All they can do
is tell me no, you know.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.584
Well, the next thing
I know,

40:54.652 --> 40:56.720
I got a return phone call.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.755
And we had
a great lawyer

40:58.823 --> 41:02.759
From the ACLU.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.899
Wilson: What do you think
about the Latonia?

41:08.967 --> 41:11.001
Boy: I'm glad
that Roxanne got it,

41:11.069 --> 41:12.803
because there was a guy
that wanted to scrap

41:12.870 --> 41:14.271
the whole place out
piece by piece.

41:14.339 --> 41:17.774
And look at that --
that picture

41:17.842 --> 41:19.743
of that chandelier.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.913
It's just, like, scary!

41:22.981 --> 41:24.915
It could fall any second!

41:24.983 --> 41:27.484
And plus, it's great!

41:32.957 --> 41:35.692
Wilson: Just two days
before the grand opening,

41:35.760 --> 41:37.861
Roxanne and linda got a call
from a neighboring

41:37.929 --> 41:40.397
businessman about
their "homosexual agenda"

41:40.465 --> 41:41.598
at the Latonia.

41:41.666 --> 41:42.933
What happened on that
phone call you got?

41:43.001 --> 41:44.201
Hitchcock: I said,

41:44.268 --> 41:46.169
"if you want to listen to people
like Diane Gramley,"

41:46.237 --> 41:47.504
I said, "you're welcome to,
but," I said,

41:47.572 --> 41:48.605
"you know what?

41:48.673 --> 41:49.706
"we're trying
to do something

41:49.774 --> 41:51.375
Wonderful
for the community here."

41:51.442 --> 41:53.477
And I said, "I want to know
what Diane Gramley

41:53.544 --> 41:55.145
Has done to promote
the community."

41:55.213 --> 41:56.213
Yeah.

41:56.280 --> 41:57.414
"besides her witch hunts."

41:57.482 --> 41:58.915
Yeah!
I said, "she's always

41:58.983 --> 42:00.917
on a witch hunt
about something."

42:00.985 --> 42:02.019
Did you say that?

42:02.086 --> 42:04.021
Yes, I did.

42:04.088 --> 42:08.125
Henderson: The negative messages
sting so bad

42:08.192 --> 42:09.860
that it takes, probably,

42:09.927 --> 42:12.195
100 positive
to keep you on track --

42:12.263 --> 42:15.866
when it's that hateful.

42:17.468 --> 42:19.569
Wilson: After
Kathy and C.J.'s case

42:19.637 --> 42:21.905
about discrimination
at the high school

42:21.973 --> 42:23.874
got attention
in the community,

42:23.941 --> 42:25.308
the local college
brought in

42:25.376 --> 42:27.711
a gay Christian performing arts
group from Pittsburgh

42:27.779 --> 42:30.013
to help people see things
from a youth perspective.

42:30.081 --> 42:32.349
Somehow, I managed to get

42:32.417 --> 42:34.785
C.J. And Pastor Micklos
to attend.

that our performance

42:39.824 --> 42:42.592

42:42.660 --> 42:44.061
and puts a face

42:44.128 --> 42:45.362
to gay people.

42:45.430 --> 42:47.030
There's a lot of people
that don't know things

42:47.098 --> 42:49.332
about gay people,
and they have the stereotypical

42:49.400 --> 42:51.501
assumptions of gay people.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.071
What you just said
about stereotypes,

42:54.138 --> 42:56.540
is that reversed at times,
as well?

42:56.607 --> 42:58.909
As far as gay people having

42:58.976 --> 43:02.112
stereotypes about
straight people?

43:02.180 --> 43:03.413
Um...

43:03.481 --> 43:05.849
Man: Yeah.
I do it.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.217

straight people

as dressing badly
and --

43:14.158 --> 43:17.027
Thanks for coming

43:17.095 --> 43:18.995
How did you guys meet?

43:19.063 --> 43:20.597
We wrote a letter
to the editor,

43:20.665 --> 43:22.966
and they...
captured us.

43:23.034 --> 43:25.535
And we became friends.

43:25.603 --> 43:26.870
Awesome.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.572
But I'm sorry
that part of the reason

43:28.639 --> 43:30.373
you're not in school
is because violence

43:30.441 --> 43:31.608
was perpetrated against you.

43:31.676 --> 43:35.078
Not good
under any circumstances.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.580
Bills: How did he
come around

43:36.647 --> 43:38.014
like that?

43:38.082 --> 43:39.616
Wilson: I guess
that he's been

43:39.684 --> 43:41.451
thinking about it
for a little bit.

43:41.519 --> 43:42.819
Wow.

43:42.887 --> 43:46.389
At times, we all
get stereotyped, don't we?

43:46.457 --> 43:47.958
Huh?

43:48.025 --> 43:52.328
Sometimes we're not so bad
as our first impressions are.

there are people

43:58.069 --> 44:00.437
who don't care
what this guy's spreading.

44:00.505 --> 44:03.406
And even if they listen,
they have seen you at work,

44:03.474 --> 44:05.909
And they have seen
everything you've done.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.777
I know, but we got
a double whammy against us.

44:07.845 --> 44:09.212
You know that.

44:09.280 --> 44:10.313
I know you do,

44:10.381 --> 44:11.982
But you have to not let this

take away from what you've
worked so hard for.

"you're not
going to do this to us."

as wonderful

with the help of the ACLU,

46:42.033 --> 46:44.734
