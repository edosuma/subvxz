WEBVTT

00:04.638 --> 00:07.172
Dinner is served!

00:07.908 --> 00:09.808
Hey, where is everyone?

00:09.810 --> 00:12.027
Ah, who cares?

00:12.028 --> 00:14.245
- More chicken bites for me.
- ( karen giggles )

00:14.248 --> 00:15.881
( crunches )

00:17.585 --> 00:19.418
( whines )

00:19.420 --> 00:22.187
( spits )

00:22.189 --> 00:25.290
Oh, great googa-mooga,
what is this?

00:26.293 --> 00:27.960
It's meatless
soy-ken wings

00:27.962 --> 00:30.562
With compassionate cashew
barbecue sauce.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.966
Yup. Mom says
meat's off the menu

00:33.968 --> 00:35.968
Until i get
my cholesterol down.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.337
Why do you think
everyone else has
boycotted dinner?

00:39.774 --> 00:41.707
Well, if the choice
is saving dad

00:41.709 --> 00:44.343
Or saving dinner,
i vote dinner.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.613
- I'm with parker.
- ( chuckles )

00:47.615 --> 00:49.314
Give meatless
a chance.

00:49.316 --> 00:52.384
You haven't tried
my simulated sausage snaps.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.819
( chuckles )

00:53.821 --> 00:56.355
- ( rustling )
- who is that?

00:57.291 --> 00:58.357
Huh.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.460
( gasps )
cindy dippledorf.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.797
What is that too-good-
to-say-hello-to-me-in-
the-grocery-store snob

01:04.799 --> 01:06.565
Doing in my backyard?

01:07.701 --> 01:09.635
( rustling )

01:10.671 --> 01:12.738
- Well, hello, cindy.
- ( chuckles )

01:12.740 --> 01:15.574
What a pleasure it is
to see you trespassing
in my backyard.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.910
Well, fix your front gate.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.912
( chuckles )

01:19.914 --> 01:21.847
I just came by
to give you your...

01:22.783 --> 01:24.483
Whatever this hot mess is.

01:24.485 --> 01:28.487
Oh, it's my "poet tree"
for poetry.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.290
- You see, it's a clever play
on the word--
- i get it.

01:32.359 --> 01:36.295
I thought the neighborhood
needed a place for people
to express themselves,

01:36.297 --> 01:38.697
So i gave
a dead tree new life

01:38.699 --> 01:41.667
By inviting neighbors
to attach poems
to the branches.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.436
And the poet tree was born.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.271
( laughs )
the kids love it.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.574
There once was
a lady named mom...

01:48.576 --> 01:50.976
Who said poetry was,
quote, "da bomb"...

01:50.978 --> 01:52.678
She thought
we'd be stoked...

01:52.680 --> 01:54.046
To pin poems
to the oak...

01:54.048 --> 01:57.316
All:
But she could not
have been more "da wrong."

01:57.318 --> 01:59.017
Good job, guys.

01:59.019 --> 02:01.420
- I didn't think
we could pull it off.
- ( chuckles )

02:01.422 --> 02:03.622
Now don't slay
the messenger, sweetie,

02:03.624 --> 02:06.859
But the neighborhood consortium
thinks your poet tree

02:06.861 --> 02:09.628
Is a horrible eyesore...

02:09.629 --> 02:12.396
Second only to that
unfortunate mustard color
you painted your house.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.769
So you just
decided to rip it out
of my front yard?

02:17.771 --> 02:19.738
Thanks for understanding.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.473
- ( stammers )
- toodles!

02:22.510 --> 02:25.410
All: Ooh!

attention...

03:22.102 --> 03:24.803
Intergalactic
council members!

03:24.805 --> 03:27.773
Ro-bat has arrived!

03:27.775 --> 03:32.110
- ( cheers, applause )
- ( screeches )

03:32.112 --> 03:35.380
The intergalactic council
are like-minded individuals

03:35.382 --> 03:38.450
Sworn to uphold the purity
of sci-fi and fantasy.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.486
It's like comic-con,
but we get together
one saturday a month,

03:41.488 --> 03:44.523
Because we cannot wait
a whole year to put on
our costumes.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.627
( mimics gas hissing )

03:49.830 --> 03:51.496
Hear ye, hear ye,

03:51.498 --> 03:54.600
As all-powerful chairman
of the intergalactic council,

03:54.602 --> 03:56.068
Earth chapter,
u.S. Subchapter,

03:56.070 --> 03:58.837
Wisconsin sub-subchapter,
stevens point micro-subchapter,

03:58.839 --> 04:01.240
I call this meeting to order!

04:01.242 --> 04:04.142
I thank you all for gathering
on this fine saturday

04:04.144 --> 04:06.645
Where we can meet far
from the judgmental eyes

04:06.647 --> 04:08.614
Of our uncostumed classmates.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.551
I bring magnificent news.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.020
Our campaign of emailing,
texting, and general annoyance

04:15.022 --> 04:17.456
Has finally brought
hollywood to its knees.

04:18.525 --> 04:19.758
Wait, for real?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.560
A movie studio is
paying attention

04:21.562 --> 04:23.862
To our humble
micro-subchapter?

04:23.864 --> 04:25.831
Yes, we have won the right

04:25.833 --> 04:28.533
To choose a comic book character
to make a cameo appearance

04:28.535 --> 04:31.770
In "the revengers ii:
Rage of folton."

04:33.040 --> 04:35.107
I open the floor
to nominations.

04:35.109 --> 04:38.510
I, joey rooney
of house rooney,

04:38.512 --> 04:40.579
On crane street,

04:40.581 --> 04:42.514
Do nominate ro-bat:

04:42.516 --> 04:44.916
Half robot, half bat,

04:44.918 --> 04:48.987
All awesome.
( screeching )

04:53.727 --> 04:57.763
Joseph rooney, i despise you
and all that you stand for,

04:57.765 --> 05:00.032
But we do share
a love of ro-bat...

05:00.034 --> 05:03.035
As well as candy bracelets
and mondays in september.

05:03.037 --> 05:06.571
So if there are
no other objections--

05:06.573 --> 05:08.840
( distorted )
stay your staff, good sir.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.076
I, orion,

05:11.078 --> 05:14.012
Defender
of the emerald nebula,

05:14.014 --> 05:16.114
<i>Also have a nomination.</i>

05:17.951 --> 05:20.018
You dare challenge ro-bat,

05:20.020 --> 05:22.988
Mysterious cloaked figure
with filtered monster voice?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.824
Which, by the way,
is awesome.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.926
How are you
doing that, fella?

05:28.962 --> 05:31.196
Reveal yourself, stranger.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.966
( gasps )

05:35.903 --> 05:38.270
Tis i,
aubrey banfield

05:38.272 --> 05:41.206
Of house banfield
on fairhaven drive,

05:41.208 --> 05:42.841
Just off main street.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.077
It's near the gas station.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.146
A lady walks among us.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.216
Artie, put it down
in the minutes!

06:00.961 --> 06:03.161
-  <i> ( door closes )</i>
- what you doing,
peeping mom?

06:03.163 --> 06:05.564
It's the dippledorfs.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.799
Ugh! What did
they dipple-do this time?

06:07.801 --> 06:09.935
There is
a catering truck,

06:09.937 --> 06:11.737
Rented tables,
flowers!

06:11.739 --> 06:14.573
They are having another party
that we're not invited to.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.743
- ( laughs )
that is so dippledorfy.
- Mm-hmm.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.712
Mom is not the only one
with dippledorf drama.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.247
Yeah, in third grade,

06:22.249 --> 06:26.184
Holden dippledorf
stole my multi-colored
goodbye puppy pen,

06:26.186 --> 06:28.587
The one i used to write
in my dream book.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.922
I mean, sure,
it's been seven years,

06:30.924 --> 06:34.259
But an elephant unicorn
never forgets.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.962
- ( gasps, chuckles )
this takes the cake.
-  <i> ( beeping )</i>

06:36.964 --> 06:40.065
Cindy is putting up
an enormous bronze giraffe

06:40.067 --> 06:41.383
- On her front lawn.
- ( laughs )

06:41.384 --> 06:42.700
Oh, sure,
that eyesore is okay,

06:42.703 --> 06:44.603
And yet she takes down
my poet tree,

06:44.605 --> 06:47.038
A brilliant oracle
of literary genius.

06:48.342 --> 06:51.176
All right, you know what?
Enough is enough!

06:51.178 --> 06:53.178
We need to take
the giraffe by the neck!

06:53.180 --> 06:55.280
- What do you think
we should do?
- What i just said.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.682
Take the giraffe
by the neck.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.786
Holden took my pen,
cindy took your tree,

07:00.788 --> 07:03.755
- We're gonna
take their giraffe.
- ( shouts ) you mean steal it?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.691
All right,
why don't you say it
just a little bit louder?

07:06.693 --> 07:09.594
- I don't think the entire
neighborhood heard you.
- Sorry, sorry.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.930
Let's do it.
But for the record,

07:11.932 --> 07:14.232
- If anyone asks, i tried
to talk you out of it.
- Okay.

07:17.671 --> 07:22.140
You hungry, maddie?
We've got soy turkey
and soy chicken.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.110
Mmm! Mom's meatless muck.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.213
No thanks, dad.
I think i'd rather just keep
chewing on my pen.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.149
Does it taste
like real meat?

07:31.151 --> 07:34.019
Give me that pen.
Mmm! Mmm!

07:34.021 --> 07:36.788
( clanking, thuds )

07:37.925 --> 07:39.891
Maddie,
you won't believe this!

07:40.828 --> 07:43.128
Can you ever
just enter the room
like a normal person?

07:43.130 --> 07:46.364
No, i can only enter the room
like an awesome person.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.368
So i was installing
new lighting

07:50.370 --> 07:52.137
To the parker tunnel
to the garage,

07:52.139 --> 07:54.306
- And guess what i found.
- A life?

07:55.242 --> 07:57.676
It's packed with bones
down there.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.211
I think they're
prehistoric bird bones.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.314
( laughs, snorts )

08:04.117 --> 08:06.017
That is one
of the most ridiculous things

08:06.019 --> 08:07.419
I think
i've ever heard in my life.

08:07.421 --> 08:10.155
No, listen, there's a kid
on the other side of town

08:10.157 --> 08:11.656
Who found
archaeopteryx bones

08:11.658 --> 08:13.124
When his family
was digging a pool!

08:13.126 --> 08:15.827
Scientists came,
validated the dig site,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.896
And he got a free trip
to archeology camp!

08:18.832 --> 08:20.782
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

08:20.783 --> 08:22.733
I mean, he turned it down,
because he has a pool,
but still!

08:22.736 --> 08:24.936
- Right.
- But can you imagine?

08:24.938 --> 08:27.205
What if archaeopteryx lived
right here under our house?

08:27.207 --> 08:29.174
- Like you do?
- Exactly!

08:30.110 --> 08:31.276
You wanna help me dig?

08:33.146 --> 08:35.213
I can't, parker.
I mean, i've gotta do

08:35.215 --> 08:38.350
My algebra ii homework,
i have to graph some parabolas,

08:38.352 --> 08:40.151
And-- take me to the bones!

08:44.057 --> 08:46.691
Speak your mind,
lady banfield.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.694
Who is your nomination
for "the revengers ii"?

08:49.696 --> 08:53.031
My nomination is...

08:54.001 --> 08:57.068
- Smoochbot!
- ( boys gasp )

08:59.339 --> 09:02.440
It's from
the romantic graphic novel
"that's my smoochbot."

09:05.112 --> 09:07.846
Okay, clearly, this is
some kind of joke.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.148
Smoochbot isn't even
a real robot.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.852
He's just a divorced guy
pretending to be a robot nanny

09:13.854 --> 09:15.820
So he can spend time
with his kids.
( laughs )

09:15.822 --> 09:19.257
There is no way
the council will ever
nominate smoochbot.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.792
Tell her, artisan!

09:20.794 --> 09:23.194
Smoochbot? Me likey.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.898
All in favor of smoochbot,
as put forward

09:26.900 --> 09:29.000
By the ravishing
lady banfield?

09:30.404 --> 09:34.072
So say we all!
Long live smoochbot!

09:34.074 --> 09:37.309
But this is our chance
for intergalactic fame.

09:37.311 --> 09:40.145
Are you saying
you'd all just sell out
your core values

09:40.147 --> 09:43.448
- For a pretty face?
- Yup, that's exactly
what we're saying.

09:44.484 --> 09:48.420
Fine. Then in accordance
with council bylaws,

09:48.422 --> 09:52.958
I wish to challenge
aubrey of house banfield

09:52.960 --> 09:54.192
To a sci-fight.

09:57.097 --> 10:01.166
But there hasn't been
a sci-fight in this council
for three semesters.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.169
Challenge accepted...

10:05.105 --> 10:07.305
Bat-boy.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.041
Oh, it is so on.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.845
Right after our scheduled...
♪ juice break. ♪

10:20.887 --> 10:23.355
Okay. Whew!

10:23.357 --> 10:26.958
- Hoo! That's heavy.
- That was completely
irresponsible,

10:26.960 --> 10:29.294
But so much fun!

10:29.296 --> 10:31.096
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

10:31.098 --> 10:34.065
- We should
take tennis together.
- Don't ruin this, mother.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.035
Sorry,
it just feels so good

10:37.037 --> 10:39.404
To get back at cindy
for getting rid
of my poet tree.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.140
- Dare i say
it's poetic justice?
- ( laughs )

10:43.243 --> 10:46.044
Take that,
you pen-stealing
party-throwers.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.013
- We totally got away
with it too.
- ( knocks )

10:48.015 --> 10:50.148
( screams )
it's the cops!
We're going to jail!

10:50.150 --> 10:52.050
Do something, mom!
Do something!

10:52.052 --> 10:54.352
Okay, okay, okay.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.354
- Get the door
and be cool.
- Okay.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.090
Be-- be cool?

10:59.092 --> 11:02.093
How can i be cool
when there's a stolen giraffe
in our living room

11:02.095 --> 11:03.461
And johnny law
is knocking at the door?

11:03.463 --> 11:06.998
Chill, baby.
Mama's got a plan.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.968
- ( grunts )
- wow, mom, a life of crime

11:09.970 --> 11:11.536
Is coming
surprisingly easy to you.

11:11.538 --> 11:15.206
- Oh yeah.
- Hello, officer.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.009
- ( laughs )
you're not the police.
- Oh. Wait, liv.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.245
It's holden dippledorf,
from across the street.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.614
We didn't steal anything!

11:24.117 --> 11:25.250
Oh! Holden!

11:25.252 --> 11:27.018
( angrily ) holden.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.587
Yes! Hungry, hungry holden
who used to eat paste.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.923
I thought you went away
to boarding school.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.858
Well, i'm back
for the weekend,

11:33.860 --> 11:36.061
And i've cut my paste
consumption way down.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.230
- ( both laugh )
- anyway, my mom has
sent me over to see

11:39.232 --> 11:41.566
If you guys have seen
a giraffe statue
around anywhere.

11:41.568 --> 11:44.235
Why would we know
anything about a giraffe?
It's not like we stole it!

11:46.073 --> 11:48.206
Of course you didn't,
but you know how she is,

11:48.208 --> 11:50.375
And she's watching me
right now,

11:50.377 --> 11:53.244
So just violently
shake your heads "no,"
and i'll be on my way.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.950
Okay, okay,
not that violently.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.152
- I don't want you
to hurt yourselves.
- ( liv chuckles )

12:01.154 --> 12:04.489
Gosh, we would sure hate
to ruin your mom's
big blowout party.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.158
- We're not having a party.
- Oh, right, you just
have a giant tent,

12:07.160 --> 12:09.294
Caterers, and everybody
in the neighborhood but us.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.296
- Actually, it's a wake.
- Oh.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.934
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.002
Yeah, my uncle died.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.438
- Oh.
- The giraffe statue was donated
by the nation of cameroon

12:20.440 --> 12:23.041
To celebrate his life's work
of protecting wildlife.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.176
- Oh.
- ( laughing nervously )

12:25.178 --> 12:27.112
Is that all?

12:27.114 --> 12:30.048
So you could see
why my mom's so distraught

12:30.050 --> 12:32.117
- Over losing the statue.
- Of course.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.486
- Who would do such
a wretched, wretched thing?
- ( chuckles )

12:34.488 --> 12:38.223
Well, not us,
so we will just
keep our eyes open

12:38.225 --> 12:40.458
For any cameroonian giraffes.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.228
Thanks.
And if you see one from kenya,

12:43.230 --> 12:45.396
- That's not him.
- ( both laugh )

12:45.398 --> 12:47.499
- It's nice seeing you.
- We didn't steal anything!

12:56.510 --> 12:57.575
Huh.

12:57.577 --> 13:02.013
This is weird,
but i am not finding
any prehistoric animal

13:02.015 --> 13:04.549
That ever existed
with 12 knuckles per finger.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.520
Whoa. Are you thinking
what i'm thinking?

13:08.522 --> 13:10.388
That we are putting
these bones together wrong

13:10.390 --> 13:12.524
And that this animal
never existed?

13:12.526 --> 13:15.293
No, that we've discovered
a new species.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.496
Oh, i like your idea
so much better!

13:19.599 --> 13:22.233
We shall name
our discovery

13:22.235 --> 13:23.968
The parker-saurus.

13:25.739 --> 13:29.707
Really? 'cause i was
sort of thinking more
in the range of maddie-dactyl.

13:31.678 --> 13:36.114
Tell you what:
How about whoever finds
the skull gets to name it?

13:36.116 --> 13:38.483
Okay, you're on.
And guess what.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.486
You're gonna lose,
'cause i'm gonna get
to the tunnels first.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.988
- No fair!
-  <i> ( door closes )</i>

13:43.990 --> 13:47.692
You're so fast.
How will i ever
catch up to you?

13:50.230 --> 13:53.298
( scoffs ) amateur.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.169
This is
a three-round sci-fight.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.673
Round one:
Intergalactic thumb wrestling.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.208
Begin!

14:05.145 --> 14:08.346
Thumb wrestling is a sport
of strategy and stamina.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.583
The last
thumb-wrestling duel lasted--
oh, and joey won.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.153
( applause )

14:15.155 --> 14:19.490
Round two:
Interstellar staring contest.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.160
Blink and begin!

14:28.168 --> 14:30.568
I could do this all day.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.303
I do it every morning...

14:32.305 --> 14:35.173
With a crow that perches
on my windowsill.

14:35.175 --> 14:38.176
That's super weird.

14:39.112 --> 14:39.844
Thank you.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.749
- ( blows )
- ( whimpers )

14:44.751 --> 14:47.819
He blinked!
The loser blinked!

14:47.821 --> 14:49.520
( cheers, applause )

14:51.291 --> 14:53.691
Okay, let's get
this giraffe back.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.560
The party
just went inside.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.396
All right. Again, mom,
not a party, it's a wake.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.866
Well, it still
would've been nice
to have been invited.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.336
( straining )
all right, let's just
count our blessings

15:05.338 --> 15:08.172
He wasn't saving elephants,
and help me pull.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.607
Oh. Oh!

15:09.609 --> 15:12.210
- Whoo!
- ( grunts ) okay.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.178
- Are we there?
- Almost.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.213
- Almost.
- What you doing, guys?

15:15.215 --> 15:17.382
( women gasp )

15:18.351 --> 15:19.751
<i>( thuds )</i>

15:24.724 --> 15:26.591
( laughing nervously )

15:26.593 --> 15:28.559
Hey, holden.

15:34.200 --> 15:38.236
- I can still see you.
- ( sighs ) i know.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.709
( women laugh nervously )

15:44.711 --> 15:46.878
So i know
this looks really bad,

15:46.880 --> 15:49.113
But i promise there is
a good explanation.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.282
Yeah, there is,
and you should tell him.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.185
- Okay. What?
- I'll get snacks.

15:57.324 --> 16:01.259
( laughs )
so what happened is...

16:01.261 --> 16:03.928
- You guys stole the giraffe.
- Yes, we did,

16:03.930 --> 16:05.730
And, holden,
i am so sorry.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.531
We had no idea that we were
ruining your uncle's wake.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.201
Oh please.
My mom's shadow-puppet tribute

16:10.203 --> 16:12.337
To life on the serengeti
ruined that wake.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.640
- ( laughs )
- this is fun.
( chuckles )

16:15.642 --> 16:18.576
- You're not mad?
- You're not mad?

16:20.780 --> 16:23.548
That's...
Kind of unexpected.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.217
He's still
a pen-stealing jerk.

16:26.219 --> 16:30.188
He's just...
Kind of a cute
pen-stealing jerk.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.290
( giggles )

16:32.292 --> 16:33.925
My uncle
would've loved it.

16:33.927 --> 16:36.294
Look, you gotta
get that thing back
before the wake ends.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.229
Okay, can we have
your help, though?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.798
Come on, get in there,
hot and hungry holden.
( chuckles )

16:41.901 --> 16:43.835
I thought it was
"hungry, hungry holden."

16:43.837 --> 16:45.937
What? No.
Yes, what it is.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.472
That's your name.
That's what i said.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.808
Let's go!

16:53.947 --> 16:57.548
Still no skull,
but at least 15 limbs!

16:57.550 --> 17:01.486
The parker-saurus must have been
a brainless stomach with claws.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.788
-  <i> ( rustling )</i>
- what's that?

17:10.397 --> 17:12.830
- ( crunches )
- dad?

17:15.969 --> 17:20.238
Why do you have a bucket
of ribs from fast al's
greasy food hut?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.607
And why are you
eating it out here?

17:23.877 --> 17:25.209
I can't take another bite

17:25.211 --> 17:27.345
Of your mom's
fakey food meat stuff...

17:28.648 --> 17:31.549
So i'm sneak-eating
the real thing out here.

17:33.319 --> 17:35.253
Dad, are you...

17:35.255 --> 17:37.388
Burying the bones
to hide the evidence?

17:38.291 --> 17:40.358
Dogs do it.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.728
Huh! He's burying them

17:43.730 --> 17:45.496
Right above the tunnel
where i discovered

17:45.498 --> 17:47.331
These prehistoric bird bones.

17:47.333 --> 17:51.335
Huh! Which are beginning
to look more and more like

17:51.337 --> 17:54.405
Chicken and rib bones
that dad has gnawed clean.

17:58.812 --> 18:00.845
For our final challenge
to determine

18:00.847 --> 18:02.413
Which character
will get the cameo

18:02.415 --> 18:05.550
In "the revengers ii:
Rage of folton,"

18:05.552 --> 18:08.886
Is the interplanetary
mind meld.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.655
( snaps )
minions!

18:13.693 --> 18:16.427
Aha! Who looks
like a genius

18:16.429 --> 18:18.763
For making these
in study hall now?

18:20.033 --> 18:22.967
All right,
i am thinking
of a number

18:22.969 --> 18:26.637
Between one
and 7,600,058.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.707
Aubrey, you and your
perfect little turned-up
nose go first.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.909
- Four.
- Correct!

18:31.911 --> 18:33.778
You are the victor!
( laughs )

18:33.780 --> 18:36.347
Oh, wait,
joey gets a turn.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.851
- Joseph.
- Um... Four.

18:39.853 --> 18:42.687
Wrong!
Aubrey is the winner!

18:42.689 --> 18:45.523
- Smoochbot reigns supreme!
- ( cheering )

18:47.627 --> 18:49.427
Celebrate in my arms.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.662
( screeches )

18:54.300 --> 18:56.968
Have you all forgotten
why we became members

18:56.970 --> 18:59.337
Of the intergalactic council
in the first place?

18:59.339 --> 19:02.707
Because we believe
in honor and loyalty.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.710
Because we are the defenders
of the fantastic!

19:05.712 --> 19:07.979
Yeah, there are
those who mock us,

19:07.981 --> 19:11.816
Call us nerds,
geeks, weirdos,

19:11.818 --> 19:15.419
Like our brothers, sisters,
cool second-cousins,

19:15.421 --> 19:17.989
Neighborhood
crossing guards.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.624
Pretty much
everyone else.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.660
But do you also want
to be called "sellouts"?

19:22.662 --> 19:26.464
I think not!
And so i say to you today,

19:26.466 --> 19:30.067
Stand fast
and stand by ro-bat.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.603
Because he would
stand by you.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.406
- Ro-bat!
- ( chanting )
ro-bat, ro-bat,

19:35.408 --> 19:38.876
Ro-bat,
ro-bat, ro-bat...

19:38.878 --> 19:41.012
I just messaged
the head of the studio.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.814
He said,
"we'll put smoochbot
in the movie.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.383
"never text me again."

19:45.385 --> 19:48.052
Victory is ours!

19:48.054 --> 19:51.489
( weakly )
but... We...
Ro-bat.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.691
( screeches weakly )

19:55.094 --> 19:57.395
Sorry, joey,
can't win them all...

19:57.397 --> 19:59.630
( chuckles )
or in your case, any.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.400
Don't you agree, aubrey,

20:02.402 --> 20:03.868
Winner of my six
alien hearts?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.404
( mimics heartbeats )

20:07.407 --> 20:11.108
Joey, i've been called weird
ever since i was a little girl.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.744
That happens when you have
your own cloak of mystery...

20:13.746 --> 20:15.546
- ( beeps )
- ( distorted )
and monster voice filter.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.549
- ( clicks )
- so thank you

20:18.551 --> 20:22.853
For standing up
for what it really means
to be a true fan.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.989
- ( chuckles )
you're welcome.
- ( both laugh )

20:24.991 --> 20:26.991
But seriously,
that monster-voice filter

20:26.993 --> 20:28.793
Is the coolest thing ever.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.128
Really?
You think it's cool?

20:31.130 --> 20:34.031
Does an electro-hyper-bot
have two processing cores?

20:34.033 --> 20:36.167
Uh, yeah, it does.

20:36.169 --> 20:37.935
( both giggle )

20:37.937 --> 20:39.870
No! But-- but--

20:39.872 --> 20:42.039
But i got smoochbot
in the movie!

20:43.710 --> 20:45.776
You sure did, buddy.
( chuckles )

20:45.778 --> 20:48.045
Minions!
Record it in the minutes.

20:48.047 --> 20:51.415
Artie is
on team smoochbot.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.151
Walking-out-
with-a-girl burn!

20:54.153 --> 20:56.821
( laughs, screeching )

20:59.058 --> 21:00.858
( wails ) joey--

21:00.860 --> 21:02.927
( calmly ) wait.
I want to do that
with my staff.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.495
( snaps ) minions!

21:06.099 --> 21:10.434
( wails ) joey!

21:14.173 --> 21:16.040
- Careful.
- ( grunting )

21:16.042 --> 21:19.110
Just wanna get the giraffe
on the pedestal here.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.012
- Okay.
- Hey, holden,

21:21.014 --> 21:23.014
Thank you so much
for helping us out
of this jam.

21:23.016 --> 21:24.949
I hope you don't think
i'm a thief now.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.118
Oh, i totally think
you're a thief.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.788
- Wha--
- but it takes one
to know one.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.725
I believe
this belongs to you.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.662
- ( gasps )
- ooh, ooh, ooh!
Two hands, two hands!

21:37.664 --> 21:39.130
Sorry! I'm sorry.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.699
Huh! What's this?

21:41.701 --> 21:44.135
Some kind of multi-ink
goodbye puppy pen

21:44.137 --> 21:46.104
That any third-grade girl
would cherish

21:46.105 --> 21:48.072
Because of the dreams
and adventures it
would make real?

21:48.074 --> 21:51.575
( laughs )
i forgot all about this.

21:51.577 --> 21:54.945
( chuckles )
in third grade,
i thought you were cute...

21:56.716 --> 21:58.482
So i took your pen.

21:59.852 --> 22:03.721
It made sense at the time,
but again, i ate a lot
of paste back then.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.090
- ( giggles )
- okay, less yappy-yappy,

22:06.092 --> 22:08.225
- More ropey-ropey.
- Sorry. Ooh!

22:08.227 --> 22:10.761
- Ooh! Ooh!
- ( thuds )

22:14.667 --> 22:16.834

22:19.205 --> 22:20.638
Liv, help!

22:22.542 --> 22:24.642
Thank you all
so much for coming.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.143
It would've meant the world
to my brother-in-law.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.279
No, no, no!
No, no! Wait!

22:29.949 --> 22:32.650

That's my house
across the street.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.828
It was really nice
walking with you.

22:43.830 --> 22:47.064

in your monster-filter voice?

22:47.066 --> 22:48.549

22:48.550 --> 22:50.033
( distorted )
it was really nice
walking with you.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.536
( giggles )

22:52.538 --> 22:55.673
I'm not gonna lie.
I like the second way better.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.609
You know, i just got
the 12th punch

22:58.611 --> 23:01.212
In my pretzel pagoda card,
and i was thinking...

23:01.214 --> 23:03.848
Maybe you and i,

23:03.850 --> 23:06.150
- The two of us, could--

23:06.152 --> 23:07.785
( screams )

23:10.223 --> 23:12.289
Oh! Joey.

23:12.291 --> 23:15.893
Joey's friend.
Carry on.
