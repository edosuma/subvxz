01:18.626 --> 01:21.561
Clear the way, people.
Superstar comin' through.

01:21.629 --> 01:23.722
Superstar comin' through.

01:24.598 --> 01:28.034
And her jet_set friend,
Miss Lola Lafonda.

01:28.102 --> 01:30.070
Lola Lafonda?

01:30.137 --> 01:34.039
lf people figure out l'm Lilly,
it's only a short jump to Miley.

01:34.108 --> 01:37.839
Oh, very smart, Miss Lola.

01:38.312 --> 01:40.940
Thank you, everybody.
l love you all. Thank you.

01:41.015 --> 01:43.711
This is totally insane.
Back off, people. Back off.

01:43.784 --> 01:47.049
Don't make me release Thor.

01:47.855 --> 01:52.485
Yeah, you go get 'em, Thor. Two pounds
of pure piddle just looking for a target.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.529
_ Actually, l think he just...
_ Oh, man!

01:55.596 --> 01:57.791
Hannah! Wait!

01:57.865 --> 02:01.232
Oh, no. lt's Oliver again.

02:01.302 --> 02:06.569
He snuck into my dressing room last week,
nearly jumped on stage the week before

02:06.640 --> 02:11.475
and just when you think he can't get any
more obsessed... he kicked it up a notch.

02:11.545 --> 02:14.036
Look at those bony little elbows go.

02:14.114 --> 02:16.742
That boy cuts through the crowd
like a Weedwacker.

02:16.817 --> 02:19.342
Let me through!

02:19.420 --> 02:23.914
Hannah, please. Kiss my hand
and l'll never wash it again.

02:23.991 --> 02:26.459
Looks like he never
washes it now.

02:26.860 --> 02:29.158
Come on, Thor,
make yourself useful.

02:32.199 --> 02:34.429
Baby. You're an animal.

02:36.237 --> 02:37.636
l like 'em feisty.

02:37.705 --> 02:42.267
_ Let's rock_'n'_roll, driver.
_ He's never gonna give up.

02:42.343 --> 02:45.437
Better hope he does,
because if he finds out your secret,

02:45.512 --> 02:49.312
he's not only gonna be in love with
Hannah Montana, he'll be in love with you.

02:49.383 --> 02:51.442
What? That's crazy.

02:51.518 --> 02:55.545
The only thing that's the same
about Hannah Montana and me is...

02:55.623 --> 02:57.488
me.

02:57.558 --> 03:00.527
And me doesn't feel that way
about him.

03:01.228 --> 03:03.753
Don't worry.
l know guys, and sooner or later,

03:03.831 --> 03:07.790
he's gonna get tired of chasing after
somebody that's not chasing him back.

03:14.642 --> 03:19.170
Do a dude a favor
and don't get on the freeway.

03:19.246 --> 03:21.339
For you, my love.

03:24.218 --> 03:27.847
Why did you have to be
such a good kisser?

04:24.945 --> 04:29.644
lt's all true.
Hannah actually kissed this hand.

04:29.717 --> 04:33.551
_ You gotta be kidding me.
_ A big, slobbery wet one.

04:33.620 --> 04:36.111
Look. lt's still shiny.

04:36.957 --> 04:41.485
Yeah, there's nothing like
the romantic glow of dog drool.

04:45.799 --> 04:48.359
Chad, dude.
Close up shop when you chew.

04:48.435 --> 04:51.336
You're getting spit
on the Hannah hand.

04:53.974 --> 04:57.842
Miley, let's go.
You're cutting into my tan time.

04:57.911 --> 05:00.141
Look at him.
He's never gonna quit.

05:00.214 --> 05:04.207
What happens if he does find out?
l really do care about Oliver.

05:04.284 --> 05:07.549
And l just don't wanna weird out
our friendship.

05:07.621 --> 05:14.083
Unless, deep down, maybe,
just maybe, you feel the same way.

05:16.897 --> 05:20.958
Yes, and maybe,
just maybe, that's insane.

05:23.070 --> 05:25.265
And now that she's
left her mark on me,

05:25.339 --> 05:29.275
it's time to take our relationship
to the next step.

05:29.343 --> 05:33.143
Tonight at her CD signing,
l'm gonna stare into her eyes and say:

05:33.213 --> 05:39.015
''You are my love, my life.
Someday you'll be my...''

05:42.289 --> 05:45.053
Note to self:
''Think of words that rhyme with 'life.'''

05:45.125 --> 05:47.753
Dude, isn't that the Hannah hand?

05:52.232 --> 05:56.259
The CD signing. lf he stares into my eyes,
he might recognize me.

05:56.336 --> 05:59.134
_ That's never gonna happen.
_ But what if it does?

05:59.206 --> 06:02.141
You could learn to love him,
like with my brother's hamster.

06:02.209 --> 06:05.406
And here's the beauty part.
lf Oliver dies,

06:05.479 --> 06:08.539
you won't have to bury him
in the backyard.

06:08.615 --> 06:13.985
When you talk, do you hear it,
or is it like a big roaring in your ears?

06:16.623 --> 06:18.284
Step off, Chad.

06:18.358 --> 06:21.521
Fine. But you're gonna
throw this away for me.

06:25.132 --> 06:27.100
Take it off, dude! Take it off!

06:27.167 --> 06:30.728
Dude. What's with you
and the gum_chewing?

06:33.340 --> 06:38.539
Little Baby Ollie.
Aunt Harriet just wants to eat you up.

06:38.612 --> 06:41.877
'Cause you're yummy,
yummy, yummy.

06:44.418 --> 06:46.318
Let me kiss that off you.

06:51.525 --> 06:53.959
l hate that woman.

07:01.235 --> 07:04.602
Been sittin' here all morning,
l'm trying to write a song.

07:05.572 --> 07:09.770
Can't remember
when it ever took me this dang long.

07:09.843 --> 07:14.746
Maybe l should just up and fly the coop
'Cause everything l've written sounds like...

07:14.815 --> 07:17.079
l got it, Dad, l got it.

07:17.150 --> 07:19.311
Prepare to be blown away.

07:19.386 --> 07:22.412
This better be good, son.
l was in the middle of a masterpiece.

07:22.489 --> 07:27.517
Jackson Stewart, come on down.
You are the proud owner of a brand_new...

07:27.594 --> 07:29.289
used car.

07:29.363 --> 07:31.456
Yes, over the last 1 5 years,

07:31.532 --> 07:35.161
this preowned beauty's been driven
by heavy smokers and sloppy eaters

07:35.235 --> 07:40.434
and one Wilma McDermott, whose cat
popped out six kittens on the front seat.

07:40.507 --> 07:44.068
Yes, some stains
just don't come out.

07:44.144 --> 07:47.671
_ And you're happy about that.
_ Yes, l am.

07:47.748 --> 07:50.342
Dad, it's mine.
lt's not perfect,

07:50.417 --> 07:53.284
but it's my own car,
and l bought it with my own money.

07:53.353 --> 07:56.845
l'm proud of you. Especially
the bought_it_with_your_own_money part.

07:56.924 --> 07:59.154
_ Let's take a look at this puppy.
_ Puppies.

07:59.226 --> 08:03.322
_ That reminds me. And in the back seat...
_ l don't wanna know.

08:12.639 --> 08:14.800
Yep, there she is.

08:14.875 --> 08:18.208
Clean, no dents and...

08:18.278 --> 08:20.838
there's that stain.

08:21.448 --> 08:24.042
_ Where is it?
_ lt's right here.

08:25.319 --> 08:26.980
This?

08:27.054 --> 08:29.852
l know.
l can't believe it's mine, either.

08:29.923 --> 08:33.289
And l can't believe
you just bought a girl car.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.418
What?

08:34.494 --> 08:36.655
Jackson, only girls drive this thing.

08:36.730 --> 08:40.928
lt's a chick mobile,
a babe bucket, a skirt scooter.

08:41.001 --> 08:43.629
You might as well have bought
a bra with tires, man.

08:43.703 --> 08:47.970
You are so wrong.
This is totally a guy's car.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.475
When l was driving home,
there was guys honking

08:50.544 --> 08:53.980
and waving and...
giving me kissy faces.

08:54.047 --> 08:57.881
Oh, no, Dad.
Tell me l didn't just buy a chick car.

08:58.485 --> 09:00.646
You didn't buy a chick car.

09:00.721 --> 09:02.985
Now say it like you mean it.

09:04.124 --> 09:09.118
l'd like to, son, but you know
how ladies like to have the final word.

09:15.836 --> 09:18.805
Thank you so much.
l love you all. Thank you.

09:18.872 --> 09:21.067
Thank you.

09:21.141 --> 09:23.609
Let's boogie, driver.

09:25.112 --> 09:29.048
That was great. Oliver stared
right into my eyes and never had a clue.

09:29.116 --> 09:33.610
Kinda like the look
he has in Spanish.

09:33.687 --> 09:37.214
l don't know what
l was so worried about anyways.

09:39.326 --> 09:41.886
Better pull over, driver.

09:41.962 --> 09:44.760
Don't be scared.
lt's me _ Oliver Oken.

09:47.401 --> 09:51.201
Wow. You're even more beautiful
upside down.

09:51.838 --> 09:54.170
Thank you. You're so sweet.

09:54.241 --> 09:56.539
He was talking to me.

09:56.610 --> 10:01.274
Look, you are very sweet,
but l have a boyfriend.

10:01.348 --> 10:06.376
A boyfriend? Wait, l don't understand.
Then why did you kiss me?

10:06.453 --> 10:08.819
l didn't. The dog did.

10:12.726 --> 10:14.421
Ah, man!

10:14.494 --> 10:18.828
Those are the lips l've been thinking about
for the past 24 hours?

10:18.899 --> 10:22.596
l'm sorry.
l was trying not to hurt your feelings.

10:22.669 --> 10:27.163
lt's just that...
l'm just not interested. OK?

10:27.240 --> 10:29.333
OK. l get it.

10:29.409 --> 10:32.742
Now get down off the roof, son,
before you dent it. This is a rental.

10:32.813 --> 10:35.805
Fine. l won't bother you anymore.

10:35.882 --> 10:39.943
lf it helps,
the dog hasn't stopped talking about you.

10:41.855 --> 10:45.951
_ You must think l'm pathetic.
_ No. l think you're sweet.

10:46.026 --> 10:48.995
_ And maybe if l didn't have a boyfriend...
_ l'd have a chance?

10:49.062 --> 10:51.053
_ l never said that.
_ But you implied it.

10:51.131 --> 10:54.692
And that's good enough.
l'll wait for you forever.

10:54.768 --> 10:57.862
_ l never said that.
_ Forever. Do you hear me, Hannah?

10:57.938 --> 10:59.735
Forever.

10:59.806 --> 11:02.206
That was close.
He almost got you tonight.

11:02.275 --> 11:04.573
Ya think?

11:04.644 --> 11:07.545
You know what that boy needs?
A real girlfriend.

11:07.614 --> 11:12.074
Dad, that is...
the smartest thing you've ever said.

11:12.886 --> 11:18.153
You know what they say _ every now and
then, even a blind pig snorts up a truffle.

11:18.225 --> 11:20.557
And that is the weirdest.

11:26.233 --> 11:28.326
That's right _ it's me.

11:28.401 --> 11:30.801
_ Yo, locker man.
_ l'm up.

11:32.973 --> 11:35.339
_ l owe you.
_ l'll be back to collect.

11:35.408 --> 11:37.376
Locker man.

11:39.946 --> 11:42.005
You're amazing, Oliver.

11:42.082 --> 11:44.346
l've been told that.

11:44.417 --> 11:47.648
_ Having trouble with your locker, Chad?
_ Yeah. Could you?

11:47.721 --> 11:50.849
Well, locker man is on the job, but...

11:50.924 --> 11:53.552
not for you, sucker.

11:54.327 --> 11:57.228
Oliver.
See that girl Pamela over there?

11:57.297 --> 12:00.528
_ She thinks you're cute.
_ Can't say that l disagree.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.400
Too bad l'm cruising
down the Hannah Highway.

12:04.471 --> 12:07.167
What about Kyla Goodwin?

12:08.241 --> 12:11.938
She is so desperate
she'll go out with anybody.

12:12.012 --> 12:15.743
My type of woman.
Too bad l'm taken.

12:17.217 --> 12:20.448
What about Lilly?
You guys would be perfect together.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.317
_ Excuse me?
_ You're both stubborn.

12:22.389 --> 12:24.755
_ l am not.
_ See? You always agree.

12:24.825 --> 12:28.784
_ No, we don't.
_ l am definitely seeing a couple here.

12:28.862 --> 12:31.194
You're not... because l'm not...

12:33.099 --> 12:37.798
That's smart, because what if one friend
loved another but didn't get loved back?

12:37.871 --> 12:41.363
Then things would get weird,
and they couldn't be friends anymore.

12:41.441 --> 12:44.239
And there is nothing more important
than our friendship.

12:44.311 --> 12:46.836
Oh, man, you love me.

12:46.913 --> 12:47.902
No.

12:47.981 --> 12:50.882
l mean, l do love you.
But like a brother or a pet fish.

12:50.951 --> 12:54.785
l'd cry if l had to flush you down the toilet,
but l don't wanna kiss you.

12:54.855 --> 12:57.688
That's a relief,
because you're my buddy.

12:57.757 --> 13:00.521
l think Hannah and you
could wind up being close friends.

13:00.594 --> 13:03.290
_ Closer than you think.
_ Great.

13:03.363 --> 13:07.094
Once Hannah and l are together,
we'll have you over for some sushi.

13:07.167 --> 13:08.759
Yeah.

13:18.812 --> 13:21.610
Soon, my love, we'll be together.

13:26.453 --> 13:28.284
You enjoy that.

13:31.958 --> 13:34.256
This isn't over, pal.

13:36.997 --> 13:38.658
Goodbye.

13:39.733 --> 13:41.963
Hello again.

13:42.535 --> 13:47.632
l know that look. Either you have
a great idea or you really gotta go.

13:47.707 --> 13:51.609
Oliver is about to totally get turned off
to Hannah Montana.

13:51.678 --> 13:53.839
And l really gotta go.

14:10.130 --> 14:12.360
l can't believe
he wouldn't take the car back.

14:12.432 --> 14:15.026
l thought l made
a very convincing argument.

14:15.101 --> 14:18.559
Well, technically, son,
getting on your hands and knees

14:18.638 --> 14:22.870
and begging for a do_over
is not really an argument.

14:22.943 --> 14:27.141
_ Hey there, neighbor.
_ Oh, man, it's Mr. Dontzig.

14:27.213 --> 14:29.147
And he's wearing his robe again.

14:29.215 --> 14:33.151
Yeah, well, count your blessings.
At least this time it's the long one.

14:33.219 --> 14:36.347
So... Stewart family.

14:37.624 --> 14:42.254
What would another leaf from your tree
be doing in my hot tub?

14:42.329 --> 14:45.594
l don't know.
Maybe it wanted to party.

14:48.201 --> 14:51.602
_ Come on. Just trying to be neighborly.
_ That's nice.

14:51.671 --> 14:55.232
But l hate neighbors.
That's why l got the big hedge.

14:56.843 --> 14:59.505
So, something needs to be done
about this.

14:59.579 --> 15:02.810
Yeah. And l think something needs
to be done about this.

15:02.882 --> 15:08.047
l would recommend possibly some sit_ups
or maybe a bigger robe.

15:08.121 --> 15:10.589
Very neighborly.

15:10.657 --> 15:12.488
Got a new car.

15:12.559 --> 15:15.392
You know, my wife,
she had a car just like this.

15:15.462 --> 15:18.954
Traded it in.
She thought it was too girly.

15:21.634 --> 15:23.829
Get your leaves out of my hot tub!

15:24.938 --> 15:27.907
l'll have you know that we Stewart men
don't define ourselves

15:27.974 --> 15:30.408
by the types of cars we drive.

15:30.477 --> 15:33.969
That's it. This dolly wagon's
going back where it came from.

15:34.047 --> 15:38.484
_ But the salesperson already said no.
_ To you, not to me.

15:38.551 --> 15:41.884
Face it, son _ l'm a bit more intimidating.

15:41.955 --> 15:44.253
Lord, take me now.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.664
_ l came as fast as l could. ls she still here?
_ There.

15:55.735 --> 15:59.364
l can't believe you saw Hannah
break up with her boyfriend on our beach

15:59.439 --> 16:01.930
the moment l was getting home
from the orthodontist.

16:02.008 --> 16:05.637
_ l know. Knock, knock. Who's there? Fate.
_ Fate who?

16:05.712 --> 16:07.577
Just go.

16:08.448 --> 16:11.884
_ This is it.
_ Good luck, Oliver. But remember:

16:11.951 --> 16:15.011
lf things don't work out,
you're still Smokin' Oken.

16:15.088 --> 16:18.489
_ Thanks, but it's gonna work out.
_ Absolutely.

16:18.558 --> 16:21.721
But if it doesn't, Smokin' Oken.

16:22.595 --> 16:24.722
'Nuff said.

16:28.902 --> 16:32.099
lt's me. Oliver. l heard about your breakup,
and l'm here for you.

16:32.172 --> 16:34.834
lf you need a hug, my arms are open.

16:37.844 --> 16:40.574
_ Get away from me.
_ l can do that.

16:48.455 --> 16:50.423
Hannah?

16:50.490 --> 16:55.257
Hi. The kid from the moonroof.
Look at you, all upside right.

17:03.436 --> 17:07.839
Where are my manners?
Sit down, sweetie. Join the party.

17:07.906 --> 17:10.375
Here. You want some gum?
Load yourself up.

17:10.443 --> 17:12.468
l didn't know you liked gum.

17:12.545 --> 17:17.539
l've surfed all your websites, and none
of them mentioned you're a chewer.

17:17.617 --> 17:20.551
l'm a chewer, all right.
l love to chew.

17:20.619 --> 17:22.781
l chew all the time, like a train.

17:25.023 --> 17:29.222
l chew in the morning,
the afternoon, the evening.

17:29.295 --> 17:34.255
_ lf it can be chewed, it's in my mouth.
_ Good to know.

17:34.334 --> 17:36.768
You should think about
updating your websites.

17:36.836 --> 17:40.670
Why? Does it bother you?
lt really turns off some people.

17:40.740 --> 17:45.143
They can't even be around me.
They love me, but l disgust them.

17:45.211 --> 17:47.475
Well, l'm not like that.

17:48.448 --> 17:49.915
You're not?

17:49.983 --> 17:52.713
_ Because it's OK if you are.
_ No.

17:52.785 --> 17:57.313
Relationships are about sacrifice,
and l accept you just the way you are.

17:57.390 --> 17:59.187
Good to know.

18:01.494 --> 18:05.897
Move over, boys.
New chew comin' through.

18:13.973 --> 18:17.170
Your mouth... lt's...

18:17.243 --> 18:19.143
Turning black?

18:19.212 --> 18:22.113
lt's licorice. l love licorice.

18:22.182 --> 18:25.049
Don't make me laugh _
it comes out my nose.

18:26.085 --> 18:27.814
_ You wanna see?
_ No.

18:27.887 --> 18:30.856
Too late. She's about to blow.

18:30.924 --> 18:35.258
Am l grossing you out?
Because l totally understand

18:35.328 --> 18:38.058
if you want to transfer
your obsession to Mandy Moore.

18:38.131 --> 18:40.998
_ You know, she's blond again.
_ No, no, no.

18:41.067 --> 18:45.561
My love is bigger than my disgust
and your black drippage.

18:45.638 --> 18:48.607
Black drippage. Watch this.

18:51.244 --> 18:53.769
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice.

18:59.752 --> 19:02.277
How do you like me now?

19:04.524 --> 19:06.253
l...

19:07.627 --> 19:10.619
_ ...still love you
_ What does it take with you?

19:10.697 --> 19:12.756
What more do l have to do?

19:12.832 --> 19:16.563
You and Hannah Montana
are never gonna be together.

19:16.636 --> 19:17.933
Why not?

19:19.138 --> 19:21.129
Because...

19:22.575 --> 19:25.806
l'm Hannah Montana. Me. Miley.

19:30.984 --> 19:33.350
OK, that went well.

19:35.321 --> 19:38.256
_ You were Hannah in the limo?
_ Yeah.

19:38.324 --> 19:41.054
_ Backstage when l hung out the window?
_ Yep.

19:41.127 --> 19:44.096
And when l hid in your bass drum
and rode on your tour bus to Phoenix?

19:44.163 --> 19:47.792
_ You did what?
_ Nothing.

19:47.867 --> 19:50.335
_ How come you didn't tell me?
_ l'm sorry.

19:50.403 --> 19:53.497
lt's just that l knew
that you were so in love with Hannah

19:53.573 --> 19:56.406
that l was afraid that
maybe you might...

19:56.476 --> 19:58.535
Be in love with you?

20:00.213 --> 20:02.613
Do you think l am?

20:02.682 --> 20:08.211
You tell me. l mean, have you ever pictured
yourself with Miley, your friend the dork?

20:08.288 --> 20:10.586
_ You're not a dork.
_ Oh, come on.

20:10.657 --> 20:15.560
What about the time l tripped in the biology
lab and spilled frog juice all over you?

20:15.628 --> 20:20.156
Right. Mom made me take off my pants
in the school parking lot.

20:20.233 --> 20:23.999
Or when we were at Andrew's birthday
party and you accidentally knocked me

20:24.070 --> 20:26.664
into the pool
in your one_man stampede for the cake?

20:26.739 --> 20:27.933
That's not fair.

20:28.007 --> 20:32.774
lt was an ice_cream log cake,
and you know l have to get an end cut.

20:32.845 --> 20:35.313
Come on, Oliver.

20:35.381 --> 20:40.876
Let's face it. The girl you thought you loved
is standing right here, and the truth is...

20:40.953 --> 20:43.285
you don't love her.

20:43.356 --> 20:46.348
Wow. l think you're right.

20:47.660 --> 20:50.458
That's two years of my life
l'll never get back.

20:50.530 --> 20:54.626
Sorry about that. So, what do you think?
Are we gonna be OK?

20:55.568 --> 20:57.559
Yeah, we're OK.

20:59.305 --> 21:01.239
_ Anything?
_ No.

21:01.307 --> 21:04.071
ln fact, it's a little awkward.

21:04.977 --> 21:07.036
Let's go grab a hot dog.

21:07.914 --> 21:12.578
So... Mandy Moore. You don't happen to
have her number, do you?

21:12.667 --> 21:15.033
Boy, you bounce back fast.

21:20.675 --> 21:23.200
Where's my dad? lt's been hours.

21:23.277 --> 21:26.610
He couldn't sell it _ that's what it is.
And now he can't face me.

21:26.681 --> 21:28.876
Maybe something good happened.

21:28.950 --> 21:31.851
Maybe he parked it
and a bunch of cheerleaders stole it.

21:31.919 --> 21:33.853
You think so?

21:35.590 --> 21:37.649
Here he comes.

21:39.193 --> 21:41.252
Still driving it.

21:41.329 --> 21:46.892
l knew it. Failure.
You're a failure as a father.

21:46.968 --> 21:51.462
Get a grip. They wouldn't take the car back,
but l did do something to beef it up a little.

21:54.308 --> 21:57.277
Dad, changing the horn
is not gonna make it a guy car.

21:57.345 --> 21:59.745
l know. But this might.

22:02.617 --> 22:05.711
Dang. This is tight.

22:07.555 --> 22:11.082
_ Son, l primped your ride.
_ Oh, yes, he did.

22:13.995 --> 22:16.828
Thank you!
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

22:16.898 --> 22:19.366
thank you, thank you, thank you.

22:19.434 --> 22:21.561
OK, son, you can let go now.

22:21.636 --> 22:25.663
lt was cute when you were five.
Now it just throws my back out.
