Rough day at the crosswalk sarge?

00:23.630 --> 00:27.940

00:28.109 --> 00:31.991

Point Place police department.

Oh, how'd it get ripped?

00:43.137 --> 00:45.387

I can see all the crimes that happens.

00:53.142 --> 00:56.524
Yeah, this town is a hot pit for a criminal activity.

00:56.700 --> 01:00.760
Hey lets not forget the great ten speed robery of '74.

01:00.928 --> 01:05.524
Yeah or that criminal mastermind who 
stole my moms carton gnome.

01:06.747 --> 01:13.140
Guys I have very exciting news. I'm in a mentor program for little girls, kinda of like a big sister thing.

01:13.319 --> 01:16.498
And there's someone here who 
is very anxious to meet you.

01:16.668 --> 01:18.418

01:19.724 --> 01:23.570
Isn't she cute?
I call her Little Jackie.

01:24.706 --> 01:29.932
For the last freaking time,
my name is Colette.

01:30.106 --> 01:33.570
Try to like her, she's just a little mouthy.

01:33.748 --> 01:35.414
Jackie, why would you be a big sister?

01:35.590 --> 01:40.650
Oh, it's a community service project foe school.
It was either this or helping out at the senior center.

01:40.822 --> 01:44.204
And you know how grey hair gives me nightmares.

01:44.380 --> 01:47.642
Can I leave now? There's nothing to do.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.746
Here. Take theese pictures of me 
and put them in order of cuteness.

01:51.915 --> 01:56.642
From "very cute" to 
"it's just not fair she's so cute".

01:56.813 --> 02:00.611
Lame, lamer, lamest.

02:01.627 --> 02:03.877
I like her.

02:04.055 --> 02:07.519
Yeah, me too.
- She's feisty.

02:07.697 --> 02:11.411
Nice name tag. Are you a garbage man?

02:13.976 --> 02:16.691
It's a badge!

02:56.884 --> 02:59.980
Get away from me.
- I bet that's the first time you told that to a man.

03:00.149 --> 03:03.745
Don't you walk out that door!

03:04.670 --> 03:08.432
What the hell was that all about?
- Oh, they've been fighting like that all morning.

03:08.605 --> 03:12.487
Sometimes he even yells at her in his native language.

03:12.666 --> 03:17.345
I belive the main idea is, she gets around.

03:17.522 --> 03:21.368
Ahh, to be young and trapped in 
a lovely scheme of a marriage.

03:21.540 --> 03:27.100
Kitty, where's the coffee?
- Oh, I'm sorry. I almost forgot.

03:31.085 --> 03:36.609
Since no one fixed my sink yet, today 
instead of coffee we're having pipe sludge.

03:37.531 --> 03:40.995
You know the doctor told me not to do household chores.

03:41.173 --> 03:45.352
It's either a working sink or a dead husband, 
it's your choice.

03:45.527 --> 03:50.372
Well Red somebody's gotta do something 
around here, the garage needs to be 
painted, the lawn mower won't start...

03:50.550 --> 03:55.110
and I'm getting tired of running to the 
hose everytime I need bourbon and water.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.953
Fine, fine we'll let Eric do it.

03:59.132 --> 04:03.060
Maybe if I supervise him he'll 
only screw up half as much.

04:03.234 --> 04:06.412
Yeah, thanks dad, you know what i got it.

04:06.583 --> 04:11.346
Yeah, this from the kid who gets sweaty 
when he needs to change out toilet paper.

04:12.778 --> 04:17.338
Don't you walk back in to that house!

04:25.337 --> 04:30.063
Officer Kennedy, I want you to know even though it's my first ride along...

04:30.235 --> 04:33.913
I'm not afraid to kill a man.

04:34.086 --> 04:40.193
I just don't want to touch him after he's dead.
- Shut it cadet. Here take care of the radio.

04:40.365 --> 04:43.663
Oh cool, we each get our own walkie talkies.

04:43.839 --> 04:49.233
I'd like a pepperoni pizza.
Adress: Holland Assdown Central.

04:49.407 --> 04:53.836
Hey, hey if you wanna play games, 
go join the highway patrol.

04:54.012 --> 04:59.274
Unit 10, we've got a 415 in progress.
- Cool. What's a 415?

04:59.454 --> 05:03.050
Why don't you look in your manual.

05:04.519 --> 05:08.662
A kenin deficating on a private property.

05:08.831 --> 05:14.057
Oh cool, it's a dog crapping on a lawn. Gun it.

05:14.231 --> 05:19.957
A 415 is a domestic disturbance you chowderhead.

05:22.394 --> 05:26.156
Dammit, I always wanted to put a dog in handcuffs.

05:29.887 --> 05:34.280
I want you out. Out I say
- It's my house.

05:34.450 --> 05:37.914
Oh really ,because you didn't sleep here last night.

05:38.092 --> 05:42.818
Or the night before that.
Or the night before that.

05:43.534 --> 05:47.248
To be fair Fez, her army buddies only got a 3 day pass.

05:48.641 --> 05:51.903
Listen to me...
- Quiet down, the neighbours are staring.

05:52.073 --> 05:57.383
Don't mind us.
Just practising for a show

05:57.557 --> 06:00.022
Take a bow and get in the house.

06:01.241 --> 06:04.705
Wow, it's a 50.
I need to go hide my stash...

06:06.599 --> 06:10.563
of comic books.
I'm a comic book paraphernalian.

06:15.474 --> 06:17.557
What seems to be the problem here?

06:17.734 --> 06:20.151
Put that down.
- Put that down.

06:20.330 --> 06:23.925
No, put that down.
- Put what down?

06:27.948 --> 06:33.128
What seems to be the problem here?
- I'll tell you what the problem is.
I am married to a whore.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.659
I am not a whore.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.928
I'm just a girl who likes a good time.

06:42.097 --> 06:45.645
I'm sorry.
I can't imagine who would've called the police.

06:45.823 --> 06:48.919
It's about time you showed up.

06:49.088 --> 06:52.970
These two are making so much noise 
I couldn't enjoyed my programme.

06:53.149 --> 06:55.649
Bob, you really had to call the police?

06:55.828 --> 07:01.638
Sorry Kitty, but how am I suposed to name 
that tune if I can't even hear the notes?

07:03.070 --> 07:09.130
Okay. Well, this kid seems to be harmless 
but since you're training why 
don't you frisk him anyway.

07:10.898 --> 07:14.029
Oh sure, frisk the foreign guy.

07:14.205 --> 07:17.503
The color of my skin is not a crime.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.807
Why do you have a frog in your pocket?

07:27.977 --> 07:30.989
It's a suprise for the ladies.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.837
Oh, he pied on me, that's resisting arrest.

07:35.010 --> 07:39.439
Well, I'm about to resist arest too.

07:45.015 --> 07:48.230
Hey dad, that was pretty cool how i shut 
off all the water in the house.

07:48.406 --> 07:53.930
Yeah, you really installed a lot of condfidence, 
muttering lefty-lucy, righty-tighty the whole time.

07:54.099 --> 08:01.838
Okay, lets get started.
Now this is a wrench.

08:02.010 --> 08:06.523
Dad i think I know what tools are.
- Good. Then grab the phillips head.

08:06.699 --> 08:10.461
Shoudn't I buy Phillip a drink first?

08:14.025 --> 08:18.370
C'mon were just a couple of guys 
having some fun on a job. Lighten up.

08:18.546 --> 08:22.260
Get a little, lefty-lucy.

08:22.439 --> 08:25.701
Do you even know what a phillips head screwdriver is?

08:25.871 --> 08:28.550
I know it's a screwdriver.

08:28.718 --> 08:30.968
Now.

08:32.025 --> 08:35.537
The water's off.
- Why is the water off?
- We're gonna fix the pipes.

08:35.708 --> 08:38.674
But I have to use the bathroom.
- What?

08:38.847 --> 08:41.479
I have to use the bathroom!

08:41.653 --> 08:43.068
Well go ahead.

08:43.244 --> 08:47.006
But you only get one flush so make it count.

08:49.356 --> 08:53.999
Well I guess I can hold it.
I just hope I don't sneeze.

09:01.077 --> 09:04.124
Would you sit still.
- Jackie, she's not a doll.

09:04.300 --> 09:07.181
Well not a good one anyway.

09:07.900 --> 09:12.163
I don't want a makeover.
You're suppose to be helping me with my homework.

09:12.337 --> 09:15.552
Homework is for ugly girls.

09:16.984 --> 09:22.509
Okay. Pretty girls get geeky 
boys to do their homework for them.

09:22.677 --> 09:29.583
Jackie, you're supposed to 
do fun stuff like go roller-skating.
Not teach her to prostitute herself for geometry notes.

09:29.752 --> 09:33.216
She's cool.
Why can't she be my big sister?

09:33.394 --> 09:36.656
See, Donna already has a little sister.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.291
Her name is Eric.

09:46.915 --> 09:50.974
Okay. Get under the sink and loosen 
that disposal so we can get to the pipes. 

09:51.143 --> 09:53.357
Under there?

09:55.831 --> 09:58.462
But, it's all spidery.

09:59.515 --> 10:04.444
Get under there or you gonna get a spider 
the size of my foot in your ass.

10:07.887 --> 10:11.018
I just realized something.
After all the years me helping you fix stuff...

10:11.194 --> 10:15.421
you finally have to hold flashlight for me.

10:15.590 --> 10:18.351
Lower dumbass.

10:21.701 --> 10:24.381
Alright, I'm in. I'm just gonna loosen...

10:24.548 --> 10:27.726
Spider, big one. Oh my god.

10:31.622 --> 10:34.003
A brillo pad?

10:35.097 --> 10:38.561
You were afraid of a brillo pad?

10:39.451 --> 10:41.748
It bit me.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.552
Boy, somewhere down the line I failed with you.

10:45.730 --> 10:51.337
You know, I think it was that one day when 
you were ten and I cought you with those dolls.

10:51.507 --> 10:55.353
They were action figures.

10:59.460 --> 11:01.341
I wanna go to the movies.

11:01.511 --> 11:05.988
Why?
You're watching me live my life.

11:06.158 --> 11:08.741
It's better than any movie.

11:12.270 --> 11:15.115
Good afternoon, civilians.

11:15.284 --> 11:18.379
Where's my frog you son of a bitch?

11:20.600 --> 11:23.147
Well the good news is I let him loose.

11:23.321 --> 11:28.084
The bad news is he hopped 
in front of an eighteen wheeler.

11:28.261 --> 11:33.106
He dodged the first wheel, but the 
last seventeen got him.

11:33.284 --> 11:36.916
Did you show up in a cop car?

11:37.093 --> 11:40.058
My training officer let me take the cruiser out for a spin.

11:40.233 --> 11:44.293
Mind if we check it out?
- Fine, just don't touch anything.

11:44.461 --> 11:49.140
I'll be in the bathroom taking care of some police business, or as the boys down at the station like to say

11:49.317 --> 11:52.245
I'll be taking the 10100.

11:54.633 --> 12:00.194
How'd you like to see a police car?
- I already saw one when the police took my daddy to jail.

12:00.368 --> 12:04.381
Alright, you know what, cheer up 
or you're not getting lunch.

12:06.564 --> 12:09.992
Oh, Donna don't worry, you're getting lunch.

12:10.164 --> 12:14.473
Okay, you know what.
You don't have a clue when it comes deeling with kids.

12:14.643 --> 12:17.655
Well if you think you're so good at it, 
why don't you give it a shot?

12:17.824 --> 12:19.408
Okay, I will.

12:19.583 --> 12:23.678
C'mon, Colette,
you've just been upgraded to Little Donna.

12:26.699 --> 12:32.093
You know what. It is your lose cause I was gonna let you give me a pedicure.

12:36.118 --> 12:39.666
I can't belive they trusted Kelso with a cop car.

12:39.843 --> 12:43.189
I can't belive he left the keys in it.

12:46.123 --> 12:48.456
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

12:48.634 --> 12:51.396
Burn rubber, little buddy.

12:58.932 --> 13:01.730
You're out of soap in the mens room.

13:01.904 --> 13:05.000
My eagle eye catches everything.

13:13.458 --> 13:16.137
This is so exciting. What should we do next?

13:16.305 --> 13:21.484
Plant some evidence?
Bust some prostitutes?

13:21.663 --> 13:26.056
Plant some evidence in the bust of some prostitutes?

13:26.226 --> 13:30.024
Oh hey, check it out. Walkie talkie.

13:30.914 --> 13:34.343
Freeze, you're under arrest.

13:36.230 --> 13:39.528
Freeze, you're under arrest.

13:41.338 --> 13:44.052
Freeze, you're under arrest.

13:44.226 --> 13:46.142
Oh yeah, that's the one.

13:47.031 --> 13:52.472
This is officer Michael Kelso.
And I'm not wearing any pants.

13:53.561 --> 13:58.074
Am I supposed to be driving all over the road?
Cause I'm loaded .

14:00.845 --> 14:04.273
My car is gone. Somebody call the police.

14:14.408 --> 14:16.824
Okay that's it. I can't fix it.
I just, I can't do it.

14:17.003 --> 14:22.611
Oh, what's the problem now?
Did the fuzzy dish towel jumped out and attack you?

14:23.701 --> 14:26.284
I can belive you said you said you failed with me.

14:26.464 --> 14:28.595
Oh, c'mon that was a joke.

14:28.766 --> 14:34.874
You know like a "priest and a rabin walk in to a bar"
or "I've failed with you".

14:35.046 --> 14:38.927
Do you really think that?
- No, not completely.

14:39.650 --> 14:43.913
I mean, maybe you're not good at fixing stuff...

14:44.088 --> 14:48.183
but you stayed behind from school 
to help the family out.

14:48.357 --> 14:50.774
And that's admirable.

14:51.581 --> 14:55.212
Yeah, yeah it is.

14:56.227 --> 15:01.287
Some might say it's the greatest gift 
a son can give his father.

15:01.460 --> 15:05.937
No, the greatest gift a son could give 
his father is a Heisman trophy.

15:06.776 --> 15:11.753
Look, you've tortured yourself enough for one day,
lets just pack it up and call the plumer.

15:11.925 --> 15:14.306
No, no. Look I can fix some things.

15:14.479 --> 15:18.824
Boba Fetts jet pack doesn't just glue itself back on.

15:19.795 --> 15:22.260
You know what, I'm gonna fix lawn mower.
Right now.

15:22.432 --> 15:26.028
No, why would you wanna embarass yourself like that?

15:26.200 --> 15:30.082
I mean, I'll be standing there, and you'll be standing there and the mower won't work...

15:30.260 --> 15:33.975
and I'll say something mean and claim it's a joke.

15:35.326 --> 15:40.219
I'm gonna fix that lawn mower.
I'm gonna fix the hell out of it

15:40.391 --> 15:44.189
And when I'm done,
you're be able to race that baby at the Indy 500.

15:44.368 --> 15:48.927
Look son, just so you know, the lawn 
mower is the red thing with wheels on it.

15:49.098 --> 15:51.182
Yeah, well not for long.

15:58.475 --> 15:59.891
More news after this.

16:00.066 --> 16:03.494
You know if a white man has stolen 
that car it would be all over that news.

16:03.666 --> 16:07.512
Fez, not having every cop in Wisconsin looking for us is probably a good thing.

16:07.684 --> 16:10.101
Shut up, whitey.

16:12.666 --> 16:16.630
Has anyone seen Little Jackie?
- No, why?

16:16.810 --> 16:18.894
Ahh, never mind.

16:20.243 --> 16:23.624
Oh my god, you lost Little Jackie?

16:23.801 --> 16:27.765
No, I didn't loose Little...
Jackie!

16:28.824 --> 16:31.241
We're playing hide and seek, 
and she's really, relly good.

16:31.420 --> 16:36.980
Oh, so you look for her, but when you play with Fez you let him sit in a closet all day.

16:38.411 --> 16:42.970
I can not belive you Donna, you said I didn't know what I was doing, and look at what you did.

16:43.141 --> 16:47.653
Okay, are you gonna help me find her or not?
- Well I'm gonna have to. I mean this is serious.

16:47.829 --> 16:52.342
If we don't find that little girl,
I'm gonna get like half hour detention.

16:59.174 --> 17:01.888
Where is my cop car?

17:02.941 --> 17:08.037
You know what, I'm gonna count to three, and before I'm done you better tell me where it is.

17:08.215 --> 17:11.478
One, two...

17:11.647 --> 17:14.029
two and a half...

17:14.997 --> 17:17.164
Three.

17:17.340 --> 17:21.651
No, you can't say three.
That's not how it works.

17:21.820 --> 17:26.714
Did my frog know how it worked when he seen that tire coming?

17:29.774 --> 17:33.488
His tiny green life flashing before his eyes.

17:33.667 --> 17:41.156
Guys c'mon. You can't just take 
somebodies car without asking permission...

17:41.328 --> 17:44.709
especialy since I kind of took it 
without asking permission.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.770
What?
- You stole it?

17:47.942 --> 17:51.621
I was supposed to be watching it 
while my training officer got a hair cut.

17:51.793 --> 17:55.305
They are gonna have my paper badge for this.

18:14.189 --> 18:18.071
Mom, dad come quick, I fixed it.
I fixed it.

18:20.091 --> 18:23.937
It was like God had control over my hands.

18:24.110 --> 18:26.491
Let me start it for you.
- Eric don't.

18:26.664 --> 18:32.390
I've seen you use a wrench.
If you went lefty-lucy instead of righty- tighty
we could all die.

18:32.566 --> 18:34.816
Let me just put this in a garage.

18:34.994 --> 18:38.090
But dad...
No,no honey, honey your father's right.
It's not safe.

18:38.259 --> 18:41.723
We'll let Bob start it later.

18:48.515 --> 18:51.313
What did you do?

18:52.157 --> 18:57.634
Why? Why, why is it always my house?

18:57.808 --> 19:02.738
You really wanna now or you wanna just keep yelling?
- I wanna keep yelling.

19:02.915 --> 19:07.059
I don't care whos fault it is, just get that thing out of here. Now!
- Yes sir.

19:07.939 --> 19:11.034
Alright everybody show's over.
Let's go in the house.

19:11.204 --> 19:14.502
Dad, the lawn mower, I fixed the lawn mower.
You gotta see.

19:14.678 --> 19:16.678
Kelso, wait...

19:20.832 --> 19:24.761
Hey look Fez, just like your frog.

19:27.530 --> 19:30.375
Oh well, it was broken anyway.

19:31.549 --> 19:35.311
No, it wasn't.

19:35.484 --> 19:37.483
I fixed it.

19:37.660 --> 19:41.124
Mom, you belive me, don't you?
- Of course I do honey.

19:41.302 --> 19:45.565
I belive that you belive you fixed it.

20:00.935 --> 20:05.948
Why are you on my seat?
- This automobile has not moved.

20:06.126 --> 20:09.472
Wait, you didn't ask me that.

20:16.005 --> 20:20.981
Did you touch anything?
Cause if you did, you are in big trouble.

20:21.154 --> 20:25.880
No, I can assure you, everything 
is exactly as you left it.

20:26.052 --> 20:31.909
Hey Kelso, did you get the cop car back before you boss found out you stole it?

20:33.001 --> 20:36.298
Okay, that... I can explain that.

20:36.475 --> 20:39.023
Where am I?

20:40.285 --> 20:43.380
Yeah, I can't explain that.

20:47.359 --> 20:49.406
Socket wrench.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.381
Drives the spaceship,
sits next to the hairy guy.

20:56.652 --> 20:59.235
Han Solo.

20:59.415 --> 21:01.296
Flathead screwdriver.

21:01.466 --> 21:04.764
Oh, I know this.
Guy with the breathing problem.

21:06.615 --> 21:10.211
Guy with the breathing problem?
This is Darth freaking Vader.

21:10.383 --> 21:15.396
Seriously dad if you don't know the dark lord of the Sith, the most hated enemy of the jedi warrior then...

21:15.574 --> 21:19.170
I guess somewhere down the line I failed with you.
