00:04.070 --> 00:08.140
Nostradamus:
<i>Since mary, queen of scotland,</i>
<i>was a child,</i>

00:08.142 --> 00:12.511
<i>The english wanted</i>
<i>her country and her crown.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:17.182
<i>She is sent to France</i>
<i>to wed its next king</i>

00:17.184 --> 00:18.784
To save herself and her people,

00:18.786 --> 00:22.187
A bond that should protect her.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.656
<i>But there are forces</i>
<i>that conspire,</i>

00:24.658 --> 00:28.494
<i>Forces of darkness,</i>
<i>forces of the heart.</i>

00:28.496 --> 00:32.197
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

00:32.199 --> 00:34.333
Francis:
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:34.335 --> 00:35.801
I don't know if I'm ready.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.437
To leave here? Or marry
the future king of France?

00:38.439 --> 00:40.139
You will wed young francis

00:40.141 --> 00:43.308
For your faith, for your people,
for scotland.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.544
Henry:
<i>She's here doing her job,</i>

00:45.546 --> 00:47.046
<i>And her job is waiting</i>
<i>for me to decide</i>

00:47.048 --> 00:48.213
When you should marry her.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.548
What matters is what's right
for my country.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.317
You don't want to marry me.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.820
(rooster crows)

00:54.822 --> 00:57.256
(chickens clucking)

01:07.367 --> 01:09.101
We've no quarrel
with the english.

01:09.103 --> 01:12.404
We're just
farmers. But...

01:12.406 --> 01:14.740
You're welcome to
share our breakfast.

01:14.742 --> 01:18.811
You're going to need
a lot of eggs.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.149
(horses approaching)

01:34.627 --> 01:37.463
A few grains should
help you sleep.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.765
But only a few
and not every night.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.201
Mmm.

01:45.238 --> 01:46.805
(man screams)

01:46.807 --> 01:48.273
What?

01:48.275 --> 01:49.575
Nostradamus.

01:49.577 --> 01:50.709
What are you seeing?

01:51.678 --> 01:53.579
War.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.516
And the cost of war.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.651
Where?
I don't know.

01:59.653 --> 02:03.489
But wherever it is, it will
reach inside this castle.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.326
(laughter)
all right, kenna.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.794
It's your turn. Not your first

02:08.796 --> 02:10.262
But your best kisser.

02:10.264 --> 02:13.165
It was a man, not a boy.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.633
Who? You must tell us.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.268
All I'll say is that
there's no point

02:16.270 --> 02:17.603
In waiting for boys our own age

02:17.605 --> 02:18.804
Who have no idea
what they're doing.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.572
Either find
yourself a man or...

02:20.574 --> 02:23.342
Take care
of your needs yourself.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.345
(others chuckle)
anyway,

02:26.347 --> 02:27.646
I think that it's greer's turn,
isn't it?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.781
My first kiss...

02:31.451 --> 02:34.186
...Is in the
very near future.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.888
I'm not like you.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.623
My family's not titled.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.259
I can't afford even
little mistakes.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.295
But... I think
I've found the man.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.899
He's tall, dark
and noble.

02:46.901 --> 02:49.635
Tomas, the son
of the king of portugal.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.503
He's here negotiating
some kind of trade deal,

02:51.505 --> 02:52.738
But he's taking his time

02:52.740 --> 02:55.841
About it, and I think
it's to stay with me.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.310
Greer, it's dangerous
to get involved with a prince.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.945
You know they marry
for alliances.

02:59.947 --> 03:03.615
Your family are commoners.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.518
Tomas is a king's
bastard, like bash.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.421
Favored, too, but
with money and land.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.657
I'm not a fool. I know a true
royal

03:11.659 --> 03:14.693
Would never look at me
except to ruin me.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.596
I can take care of myself.

03:17.598 --> 03:18.797
(horse neighs in distance)

03:19.732 --> 03:21.600
Your majesty,

03:21.602 --> 03:22.834
Your uncle,

03:22.836 --> 03:23.869
Claude de guise,
is here and wishes

03:23.871 --> 03:24.937
To see you at once.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.644
You look well, mary.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.648
Your mother sends her affection.
Read it later.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.618
You may be assured the love
is in there, as is the news

03:39.620 --> 03:41.620
Of a crisis in scotland.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.755
The english.
They're massing
on the border.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.624
And these are not
the normal skirmishes.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.726
They're out in number.
They're looking for weakness,

03:47.728 --> 03:49.761
And if they find any...
We must respond with strength.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.598
Surely my mother
has sent soldiers.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.299
Of course. But not enough.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.701
We need more men.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.269
Our strongest ally is France.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.637
King henry will help us.
He's been asked,

03:58.639 --> 04:00.639
And he's been slow to answer.

04:05.712 --> 04:08.947
You were sent here to secure the
alliance by marrying

04:08.949 --> 04:10.949
Henry's son.
Now they're dragging

04:10.951 --> 04:12.484
Their feet. What happened?

04:12.486 --> 04:13.952
Nothing happened.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.688
They're being politicians.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.525
Francis and his father aren't
eager to commit to scotland.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.394
They'd rather keep
me in a drawer,

04:22.396 --> 04:25.030
Like a pair of gloves
for cold weather.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.499
And then when the weather
grows cold for France,

04:27.501 --> 04:29.501
They'll take me out
and I'll be wed.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.704
They're afraid of what
a permanent bond might mean.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.573
But right now, we have
immediate problems.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.442
Scotland needs more troops.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.979
As queen,
you must do something.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.758
Henry:
Mary.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.528
(clears throat)

04:56.530 --> 04:59.298
Your grace.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.900
(door shuts)
we've been...

05:01.902 --> 05:04.803
Discussing this business
in scotland.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.939
You have
my sympathy.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.309
Father, I believe
her majesty is here
for more than just sympathy.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.944
Of course.
We're sending wagons, gunpowder,

05:12.946 --> 05:15.547
Supplies for your army...
Supplies are useless
without men.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.549
Surely you can spare a few.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.618
You have so many more soldiers
than we do.
And...

05:19.620 --> 05:20.919
Many more borders as well.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.721
You only have to
worry about England.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.623
I have England, Spain,

05:24.625 --> 05:26.858
A hundred italian and
german principalities...
You are supposed

05:26.860 --> 05:28.860
To be our ally.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.963
If our positions were reversed,
scotland would help.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.965
(sighs)

05:33.967 --> 05:36.101
Mary, I'm sorry.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.103
Eight companies.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.541
Six!
I hope I will have

05:42.543 --> 05:45.777
The happiness of seeing you
tonight at the entertainments.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.012
Yes?

05:47.014 --> 05:49.548
I hope you understand

05:49.550 --> 05:51.116
The position
you're putting us in.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.884
(clears throat)

05:52.886 --> 05:55.387
Lives will be lost.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.591
She only asked
for six companies.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.826
And what if we lose
those companies?

06:00.828 --> 06:02.661
We look weak
in England's eyes.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.763
So we send more and we lose
those. When do we stop?

06:04.765 --> 06:08.567
Before or after England
decides we're soft prey?

06:08.569 --> 06:10.936
At the moment, the scottish
border is quicksand.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.637
You know this.

06:12.639 --> 06:13.972
A pretty girl
doesn't change that fact,

06:13.974 --> 06:15.607
Even if she happens
to be your fiancée.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.410
And their queen.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.147
Mary.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.782
Mary, my father just...

06:23.784 --> 06:26.752
The political situation
is complicated.
Complicated?

06:26.754 --> 06:29.788
People will be dying soon.
Isn't that complicated enough?
Mary,

06:29.790 --> 06:32.924
I agree with you.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.794
You do?
I think France should help
scotland in this.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.696
We're at a tilting point:

06:37.698 --> 06:39.631
If England invades scotland
and succeeds,

06:39.633 --> 06:41.633
It'll be that much
of a stronger enemy to France.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.435
Then we're on the same side.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.437
For all the good it does.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.105
One day, if things goes well,

06:47.107 --> 06:50.709
We'll rule France and scotland
and we'll be together.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.944
Now we have no real power.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.846
We have to wait.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.448
No.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.850
I'm tired
of waiting.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.853
And if we have no power,

07:01.855 --> 07:05.590
Then we must find a way
of getting some.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.033
(grunts)

07:15.035 --> 07:16.468
(sighs)

07:16.470 --> 07:17.869
Come play with me?

07:17.871 --> 07:19.738
Happily.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.007
Sometimes you just need
to kick something.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.843
You're not like a girl.

07:24.845 --> 07:27.446
What did you think
girls were like?

07:27.448 --> 07:29.948
They sit around, afraid they're
gonna mess up their dresses.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.918
(chuckles)
you like to have fun.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.119
(grunts)

07:34.121 --> 07:36.755
(birds chirping)

07:36.757 --> 07:39.024
Oh.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.763

07:44.765 --> 07:47.499

07:49.870 --> 07:51.570
Mary:
It's stuck.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.805
Maybe you should fetch
someone with a ladder.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.507
Wait, I've got it!

07:58.744 --> 08:00.045
Your majesty,

08:00.047 --> 08:03.882
May I present
tomas of portugal,

08:03.884 --> 08:06.184
Lord of palmela?
Tomas,

08:06.186 --> 08:08.653
Mary, queen of scots.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.956
Hello.

08:10.958 --> 08:14.493
Do you often stroll
in trees, your majesty?
Um,

08:14.495 --> 08:17.496
I climbed up here
to fetch prince charles' ball,

08:17.498 --> 08:20.499
But I guess he got
tired of waiting.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.868
Are you sure? Because from down
here,

08:22.870 --> 08:25.871
It looks like scotland attacked
portugal without provocation.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.073
(chuckles)
um, turn around

08:28.075 --> 08:31.710
So I can come down.
We may have a diplomatic
incident here, your majesty.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.612
Greer, please get your
friend to turn around.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.014
I can't climb down with him
staring up my skirts.

08:38.084 --> 08:39.217
(screams)

08:39.219 --> 08:40.218
(grunts)

08:40.220 --> 08:42.921
Oh...

08:42.923 --> 08:44.189
Your arm!

08:44.191 --> 08:45.257
I'll be fine.

08:45.259 --> 08:46.725
Are you all right?

08:46.727 --> 08:49.027
Yes. I'm so sorry.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.263
(sighs)
just promise,
no more attacks from the sky.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.632
(chuckles)
portugal surrenders.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.867
Greer of kinross,

08:55.869 --> 08:59.070
I look forward
to seeing you tonight.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.973
Your majesty.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.180
I might not have made a very
good first impression,

09:09.182 --> 09:11.816
But I see why you like him.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.718
Isn't he perfect?

09:13.720 --> 09:14.986
I have it all planned.

09:14.988 --> 09:15.987
The boating party's
coming up.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.023
I'll pack a picnic basket,

09:18.025 --> 09:20.659
We'll be out there on the lake
under the moonlight...

09:20.661 --> 09:22.160
And nature will
take its course.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.163
Your first kiss.
And a beginning,
I hope.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.731
Well, good luck.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.200
He definitely looks
worth the wait.

Your mind's elsewhere.

or plump lady isabelle

09:55.963 --> 09:58.163
With the breasts
like two pigeons, huh?
If I told you,

09:58.165 --> 10:01.099
You might poach. You've a liking
for pigeon, as I recall.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.000
(chuckles)

10:02.002 --> 10:03.602
We should help scotland.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.370
Not for mary but for France.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.006
By all means, explain.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.741
When you say that the border
is quicksand,

10:09.743 --> 10:11.076
You assume that we'll lose.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.944
England hasn't sent
its entire army north.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.348
They're poking to see
what reaction they get.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.850
We could strike fast,
hit back hard and win.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.151
But if we do nothing,

10:20.153 --> 10:22.220
We risk losing
the entire scottish alliance.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.055
Years of planning, wasted.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.358
So it's a balance
of risks either way.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.026
Very good.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.227
Except I've decided
the...

10:29.229 --> 10:31.162
Reasons against outweigh
the reasons for.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.397
And guess what:

10:32.399 --> 10:34.065
I'm king.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.133
Another round?

10:37.970 --> 10:40.071
You never spar with me.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.108
Is it a good idea for a king
to spar with his usurper?

10:43.110 --> 10:44.909
You mean his inheritor.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.044
(laughs)

10:46.046 --> 10:47.946
If you win,

10:47.948 --> 10:49.848
I shut up
about this whole subject.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.285
If I win, you send
those six companies of men.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.231
(yells)

11:07.366 --> 11:10.769
(grunting)

11:17.043 --> 11:19.344
(panting):
Very good.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.946
Very good.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.050
When can they leave?

11:25.052 --> 11:27.452
Oh. No one's going
to scotland.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.157
But your word, your wager.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.192
Well, that's
what kings do.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.694
We make promises
to everybody,

11:35.696 --> 11:37.829
And whatever works for
the realm, we keep.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.031
Otherwise, they
never happened.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.200
Lesson for today.

11:48.074 --> 11:51.009
That's not the way...
Don't need any more
lessons right now.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.484
Bread-- the seeded kind.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.419
I'm not talking
about everyday black bread.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.789
Chestnut spread.
Strawberry tartlets.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.224
Strawberries this late?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.226
Uh, I can make you apple tarts.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.794
Everyone has apple.
I wanted something different.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.029
Talk to god.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.198
He put the strawberries away.
Fine.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.000
But I want the apple tarts
that have the honey on top.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.168
Baked, so they're golden brown,

12:17.170 --> 12:18.970
Not soggy,
to taste fresh

12:18.972 --> 12:22.207
And crisp after two hours
in a boat on the lake.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.309
You want an awful lot-- this
must be for someone special.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.477
Not that it's

12:25.479 --> 12:27.178
Any of your business, but yes,

12:27.180 --> 12:28.847
It's for someone very special.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.015
I expect your best.

12:31.017 --> 12:34.018
Why don't you just
leave the list.
But who would
read it to you?

12:34.020 --> 12:37.856
Mary:
Greer? I've been looking
for you everywhere.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.131
You said tomas was
in from portugal

12:46.133 --> 12:48.066
To negotiate
a trade deal.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.301
What kind of deal?
I don't know.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.303
Something about buying
french timber for ships.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.038
Ah, that makes sense.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.040
They're expanding their
fleet-- war ships,

12:56.042 --> 12:57.909
Exploring vessels
for the new world.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.277
Of course they
need timber.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.279
(laughs):
Why are we talking
about wood?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.148
Because it
occurred to me

13:03.150 --> 13:05.416
That if a queen can't
command what she needs,

13:05.418 --> 13:07.485
Maybe she can buy it.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.923
Tomas:
May I know where you're
taking me, your majesty?

13:11.925 --> 13:13.558
Mary:
I didn't want to be overheard.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.960
Mm, intriguing.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.896
Is it romantic?

13:17.898 --> 13:19.898
Conspiratorial?

13:22.168 --> 13:23.401
May I have a hint?

13:23.403 --> 13:25.003
It's about timber.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.805
Timber?
Timber.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.140
Scotland has trees,
too, you know.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.476
Whatever deal you have
with king henry,

13:31.478 --> 13:34.245
I'll do better-- <i>if</i>
<i>you close the deal now</i>

13:34.247 --> 13:37.115
And if you send us men
instead of money.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.384
Your country is in need.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.187
But surely, king henry
will help you.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.822
I mean, the alliance.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.195
I see.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.130
Well, my father

13:52.132 --> 13:53.498
The king empowered me

13:53.500 --> 13:56.201
To make whatever deal
I think best.

13:56.203 --> 13:59.037
And I'd be a fool
to turn this down.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.473
But... Henry considers
our deal almost made.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.543
And it's not a small thing
to anger a king

14:05.545 --> 14:08.179
In his own house.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.181
Meet me this afternoon.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.851
I'll confirm
our transaction then.

Never.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.611
I sense a refusal.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.848
But I am a queen.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.350
And flattered as I am
by your attentions,

18:06.352 --> 18:07.852
I must marry a nation,

18:07.854 --> 18:09.754
Not a man.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.623
What is this?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.625
My father's been writing

18:14.627 --> 18:17.728
To the pope, arranging
to have me declared legitimate.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.600
My father is dying,
and I'm his only living son.

18:22.602 --> 18:27.538
His grandson is next in line,
and he's only three years old.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.707
My father doesn't
trust the regent

18:29.709 --> 18:31.709
To safeguard portugal.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.511
He wants me on the throne.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.681

will be made any day now.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.282
So, you see...

18:38.284 --> 18:40.651
I can lay my heart
at your feet,

18:40.653 --> 18:42.653
And my country as well.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.689
We can save scotland.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.658
If you marry me.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.495
Will you?

18:59.471 --> 19:01.272

the future king?

19:01.274 --> 19:02.740
What does your
uncle think?

19:05.477 --> 19:07.145
I haven't told him yet.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.147
Because
you're worried

19:09.149 --> 19:11.415
He'd press you to accept tomas,

19:11.417 --> 19:13.818
And you're not ready
to let francis go?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.586
It's all right
to admit it, mary.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.422
I'd be exchanging a man I...

19:18.424 --> 19:22.160
Admire...
For a man I barely know.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.662
And true support
for scotland.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.665
Tomas seems nice.
Feelings may come

19:27.667 --> 19:29.700
In time.
And what of greer's feelings?

19:29.702 --> 19:32.270
She had her eye on tomas.
A crown prince would

19:32.272 --> 19:34.672
Never marry her--
she's not even a possibility.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.642
Well, it's entirely possible
that nothing will come of it,

19:37.644 --> 19:39.243
And that tomas will

19:39.245 --> 19:40.678
Return home to portugal.

That's all I was given.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.645
You know no more than I.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.114
Well,

22:30.116 --> 22:31.716
There's a showman for you.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.585
Musicians, dancing music.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.954
Enough
of this foolishness.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.622
Why would you say that
to my friend?

22:38.624 --> 22:39.924
Why scare her?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.759
I can only say
what I've seen.

22:41.761 --> 22:44.962
Like a dragon
and a field of poppies?

22:46.431 --> 22:48.065
Are people fooled
by you?

22:48.067 --> 22:50.000
The only dragons are
in children's stories.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.469
Then I must be a liar.

22:51.471 --> 22:54.472
But why these lies?

22:54.474 --> 22:56.474
Who gains?

22:56.476 --> 22:58.442
The fortune-telling
was henry's idea,

22:58.444 --> 22:59.677
So it can't have come
from catherine.

22:59.679 --> 23:03.647
Who are you
and who do you serve?

23:03.649 --> 23:07.985
The realm...
Myself, the truth.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.720
The truth?

23:09.722 --> 23:12.523
Serving the truth at
court is a crooked path.

23:18.430 --> 23:20.598
You know, I don't
think I ever noticed

23:20.600 --> 23:23.100
That tiny white
scar on your cheek.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.736
It becomes you.

23:25.738 --> 23:26.737
Thank you.

Mary,

23:33.946 --> 23:36.580
Believe me, I've
argued with my father.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.583
I've explained why
politically it's a good idea.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.519
I've, I've done
more than argue.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.521
I've done all
I can reasonably do.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.556
Then maybe you should be
unreasonable.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.426
I commanded the musicians

23:48.428 --> 23:49.727
To play music
from my country.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.583
You're rich
and you're beautiful

25:19.585 --> 25:22.753
And you're engaged
to the crown prince

25:22.755 --> 25:24.989
Of France.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.625
I thought perhaps you could
leave tomas for me.

25:27.627 --> 25:31.629
It's not as if you could
marry him anyway.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.931
You knew how important
this was to me.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.701
It just wasn't
important to you.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.706
No, greer...

25:42.708 --> 25:45.743
You do have a way of leaving
chaos in your wake.

25:47.579 --> 25:49.580
What was that about?

25:49.582 --> 25:52.016
Tomas asked me to marry him.

25:53.018 --> 25:55.619
He's being declared
legitimate.

25:55.621 --> 25:58.322
He says his father wants him
on the throne imminently.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.324
It's not what I want,

26:00.326 --> 26:03.794

are extremely limited.

26:06.732 --> 26:07.932
You're making a new
alliance with portugal?

26:07.934 --> 26:10.267
It was his idea, not mine,

26:10.269 --> 26:11.936
And he's willing to actually
get married, too,

26:11.938 --> 26:13.137
Which is more than
your family is offering.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.638

no power,

26:20.746 --> 26:22.813
That there was
nothing we could do.

"catch him! Catch him!"

32:30.449 --> 32:32.249

32:32.251 --> 32:35.686
I chased that damned goat
over half the mountaintop.

32:35.688 --> 32:38.488

no more sheep and goats.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.157

Mm, didn't think so,
where you come from.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.271

keeps hounds.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.007
They're all over the
house, all the time.

32:57.009 --> 32:59.242
I think he cares
more about the hounds

32:59.244 --> 33:00.644

and my sisters.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.613
Is that why he sent you
so far away, with queen mary?

33:03.615 --> 33:06.083
Oh, he sent me here
to be married.

33:06.085 --> 33:08.585
I have to marry well,
for my family's sake.

33:08.587 --> 33:11.488
My parents made that
very clear to me.

33:11.490 --> 33:15.292
The only way to rise in the
world is through land and title,

33:15.294 --> 33:17.127
And for people like us,

33:17.129 --> 33:19.396
The only way to achieve
these things is to marry them.

33:19.398 --> 33:22.399

in your life?

33:22.401 --> 33:25.168

35:05.437 --> 35:06.403
With this new
venetian drink.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.872
It's coffee.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.307
I'm sorry.

35:10.309 --> 35:12.442
The truth is,

35:12.444 --> 35:14.544
There never really was much
between tomas and me.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.179
Some flirting--

35:16.181 --> 35:18.648
All very proper--
but that's it.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.484
I wanted to believe
there was more.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.419
Well, you know why.

35:22.421 --> 35:25.422
Oh, I imagined
the whole fairytale.

35:25.424 --> 35:28.191
The perfect
first kiss with

35:28.193 --> 35:30.360
The man with the white mark
on his face.

35:30.362 --> 35:33.763
Me as the heroine,
helping my family.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.599
I know you'll find
the right man, greer.

35:35.601 --> 35:38.368
I know you will.

35:38.370 --> 35:41.438
Should I tell you a secret?

35:41.440 --> 35:45.408
Maybe it's because I've been
engaged since I was six, but

35:45.410 --> 35:47.844
I've never been kissed, either.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.379
(laughs)

35:49.381 --> 35:51.381
Well, actually,

35:51.383 --> 35:53.350
Things have changed
for me in that respect.

35:53.352 --> 35:56.286
What?! No! Who is it?
Tell me everything!

35:56.288 --> 35:57.287
(laughs)

35:57.289 --> 35:58.688
Morning.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.891
I suppose I should send down
for breakfast then.

36:00.893 --> 36:04.427
No. By all means, I'll go.

36:04.429 --> 36:07.230
(laughter)
coffee?

36:07.232 --> 36:09.232
And we want the sweet
butter, not the other kind.

36:09.234 --> 36:10.534
And try putting
some heavy cream

36:10.536 --> 36:12.469
In that coffee, but
for heaven's sake,

36:12.471 --> 36:13.837
Not goat's milk cream.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.173
I'll take care of it.

36:16.175 --> 36:19.442
Lovely morning, my lady.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.788
Our men will have gone
north to the channel.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.224
Calais is in english hands,

36:34.226 --> 36:35.792
So our men will take
ship at outreau.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.461
Man:
Guards?
(horse neighing)

36:44.735 --> 36:48.738
Quickly!

36:48.740 --> 36:52.442
(neighing)

36:52.444 --> 36:53.710
It's bash.

37:19.437 --> 37:20.670
(bird screeching)

37:23.841 --> 37:28.011
Mary:
The cost of war will reach
inside this castle.

37:31.482 --> 37:33.016
How is he?
He's gravely
injured.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.918
I can tend to
his wounds,

37:34.920 --> 37:36.486
Ease the pain,
but I make no guarantees.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.021
Bash:
Father,

37:38.023 --> 37:41.524
The english...

37:41.526 --> 37:43.927
Rode out from calais

37:43.929 --> 37:46.496
To face us.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.598
We never made it to the ships.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.701
It was a slaughter.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.770
Nostradamus:
He shouldn't be talking.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.672
I'm give him a potion,
put him to sleep.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.607
Clear the room.
It's the best

37:57.609 --> 37:59.542
Thing for him.
Francis:
Bash?

37:59.544 --> 38:01.878
Bash, I'm so sorry.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.747
Henry:
Come.
(gasps)

38:03.749 --> 38:05.582
Come.

38:12.056 --> 38:14.958
Go wait.

38:17.895 --> 38:22.565
Kings don't apologize.

38:22.567 --> 38:23.967
I didn't know this would happen,

38:23.969 --> 38:26.036
But I knew it was a risk.
So did you.

38:26.038 --> 38:30.407
Lives are always at risk,
at our hand, at our will.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.509
For a prince, this was a...

38:32.511 --> 38:34.744
A cheap lesson.

38:34.746 --> 38:38.548
Cheap? Six
companies.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.484
Your son-- I
know you love him.

38:41.486 --> 38:45.322
You were influenced
by your heart.

38:45.324 --> 38:47.590
If that happens
when you are king,

38:47.592 --> 38:49.659
You could lose
10,000 men.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.795
You could lose France.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.837
The english were
ready for us.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.672
Someone
told them.
Yes.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.708
While bash was riding
to six different companies,

39:04.710 --> 39:07.577
It appears someone loyal to the
english rode straight to calais

39:07.579 --> 39:09.546
And warned them.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.449
Well, aren't you going
to tell francis?

39:14.719 --> 39:17.387
No. Not today.

39:17.389 --> 39:19.656
It would ruin the lesson.

39:19.658 --> 39:23.526
Let something come
of this treachery.

39:23.528 --> 39:26.596
Francis will never trust
his heart again.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.898
That's the only way to rule.

39:31.936 --> 39:34.471
Francis?

39:34.473 --> 39:36.539
Francis?

39:36.541 --> 39:38.475
(panting)

39:38.477 --> 39:39.909
You did the right thing.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.745
(crow caws)

39:41.747 --> 39:44.481
Talk to me.

39:58.429 --> 40:02.065
You should
marry tomas.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.567
My father's right.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.970
I haven't been
thinking clearly.
That's not true.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.738
You were trying to help.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.939
I <i>can't</i> help you.

40:09.941 --> 40:12.041
France can't help.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.077
There are no more troops
to send.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.879
Do what's right
for your country.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.480
Francis!

40:17.482 --> 40:19.883
Can you say that I'm wrong?

40:27.525 --> 40:29.793
(crow cawing)

40:40.004 --> 40:42.639
(sighs)

40:42.641 --> 40:44.908
(knocking)

40:47.845 --> 40:50.447
Well...

40:50.449 --> 40:53.183
I suppose you're going
to have to teach me portuguese.

41:01.158 --> 41:03.626
I'll make you happy.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.763
You already have.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.068
There are eight companies
of fighting men on that ship.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.737
They'll be in scotland
in two days.

41:23.614 --> 41:27.817
The english lion will fight the
dragon on the field of poppies.
