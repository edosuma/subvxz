00:21.954 --> 00:24.224
( Shun grunting )

00:30.930 --> 00:32.365
( coughs )

00:35.234 --> 00:36.469
( speaking Japanese )

00:56.922 --> 00:58.124
( grunts )

00:58.624 --> 01:00.392
( winces )

01:00.426 --> 01:02.295
( chuckles )

01:12.905 --> 01:14.374
( winces )

01:36.295 --> 01:38.465
( shower running )

02:02.521 --> 02:04.390
( in English ) Thanks
for helping me cook.

02:04.423 --> 02:06.959
You didn't have to come
on delivery duty.

02:06.993 --> 02:09.395
It's not safe
to walk around alone.

02:09.429 --> 02:12.698
Besides, I like the company.

02:12.732 --> 02:13.633
( door beeps )

02:20.273 --> 02:23.576
That's weird.
She didn't take
the last one.

02:29.181 --> 02:31.251
Hey, Lee? You in there?

02:39.492 --> 02:41.327
( grunts )

02:52.938 --> 02:54.440
( tool clicking )

02:59.812 --> 03:01.180
Logan:<i> Fuck me.</i>

03:01.213 --> 03:03.015
That thing looks
almost functional.

03:03.048 --> 03:05.451
-Almost.
-Must be all my help.

03:06.318 --> 03:07.887
Speeding the process
up, huh?

03:08.755 --> 03:12.024
And it doesn't stop there.

03:12.058 --> 03:13.826
Check it out.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.396
You said your gadget
was having trouble focusing.

03:16.429 --> 03:21.100
I thought this might help
refract the light,
or something.

03:21.133 --> 03:23.035
"Refract the light"?

03:23.069 --> 03:24.771
Do you even know
what that means?

03:24.804 --> 03:29.275
Uh, yeah, you have light
and then you...

03:29.308 --> 03:31.210
Refract it. It's simple.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.379
Not the only thing
that's simple.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.115
( scoffs ) I'm not stupid,
okay, Lee?

03:36.148 --> 03:37.550
I do actually
get machines.

03:38.618 --> 03:41.688
I also get what
you're trying to do.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.590
Really? Enlighten me.

03:44.623 --> 03:49.795
Well, this parasite,
its memory about the person
it's in, fucked.

03:49.829 --> 03:52.965
Eric forgot his name.
Taylor forgot his job.

03:52.998 --> 03:55.568
Ergo, memory fucked.

03:55.602 --> 03:56.735
( tool clicks )

03:56.769 --> 04:00.472
Now, you have access to a chip
with all our data on it.

04:00.506 --> 04:02.875
Using that,
we can set up a little pop quiz

04:02.908 --> 04:05.611
of 10 things that you should
really know about yourself.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.982
Whoever fails,
infection candidate number 1.

04:09.848 --> 04:10.850
Booyah.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.452
Hmm.

04:13.185 --> 04:15.421
I'll take that "Hmm" as,

04:15.454 --> 04:20.593
"Wow, Logan, behind that rugged
exterior, you're actually
a fucking genius."

04:22.462 --> 04:23.596
Mmm.

04:23.629 --> 04:24.931
( chuckles )

04:26.899 --> 04:27.934
So, uh...

04:29.334 --> 04:32.005
-Where is the chip?
-I'm not telling you.

04:32.038 --> 04:33.239
<i> Come on, Lee.</i>

04:33.272 --> 04:34.740
<i> You've eliminated me
from the lineup.</i>

04:34.774 --> 04:37.709
All I've done since you
recruited me is fucking help.

04:37.743 --> 04:40.546
-Ergo, trust me--
-Stop saying "ergo."

04:44.917 --> 04:46.986
Lee, I'm just
trying to make up
for what I did.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.422
I'm sorry, okay?

04:50.455 --> 04:52.791
-That's all.
-( rumbling )

04:52.825 --> 04:54.027
( tools clattering )

05:00.299 --> 05:01.501
What was that?

05:21.053 --> 05:24.090
Where's Lee? We could
really use her on this.

05:24.123 --> 05:25.458
I tried knocking.

05:26.792 --> 05:27.794
Well...

05:30.362 --> 05:32.431
( mumbling )

05:32.465 --> 05:34.133
-What?
-The rumble we heard,

05:34.167 --> 05:35.934
it came from Ring 10.

05:35.968 --> 05:38.838
-We're losing pressure
in Cell 50.
-Do we know why?

05:38.871 --> 05:40.572
Rey: I'm not sure.

05:40.606 --> 05:44.577
Unless, the sealant
around the asteroid, it could
have started to break down.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.379
Wait. We went down there.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.014
You said everything
looked okay.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.984
Well, I also said
it wasn't my job to know.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.587
Look, the sealant is
a temporary solution, okay?

05:54.620 --> 05:56.054
It holds
the asteroid in place.

05:56.088 --> 05:59.158
It keeps the ring airtight,
and prevents
a large-scale breach.

05:59.191 --> 06:01.594
Yeah, so, what happens
if that fails?

06:02.561 --> 06:03.963
A tear in the side of the ship.

06:03.996 --> 06:07.133
Depressurization could begin,
and it could spread.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.069
Henri: It's just one ring.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.672
How much would that affect
the rest of the<i> Origin?</i>

06:12.705 --> 06:15.273
Well, the rings work in tandem,
so if one malfunctions,

06:15.307 --> 06:19.612
the problems ripple out.
Gravity, forward momentum,
even life support.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.614
Are you saying
this thing could kill us?

06:22.648 --> 06:24.150
If it's not repaired, yes.

06:25.818 --> 06:26.919
How do we stop it?

06:28.988 --> 06:31.623
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I...

06:31.657 --> 06:35.027
( stammers ) It's not
my area of expertise.

06:38.798 --> 06:42.068
Don't forget,
we're all here
because of you.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.406
Figure it out.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.915
( Rey exhales sharply )

06:55.948 --> 06:57.116
( beeping )

07:04.223 --> 07:06.525
We can try
and repair the seal.

07:06.558 --> 07:08.260
You mean go down there?

07:08.293 --> 07:12.398
Yes, uh, the breach
isn't significant yet,
so we patch the sealant.

07:12.431 --> 07:14.801
It only has to
last us until Thea.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.137
Let's do it.

07:21.573 --> 07:23.843
( indistinct chatter )

07:34.987 --> 07:36.189
( Hideto laughing )

07:52.104 --> 07:54.072
( cards tapping on table )

07:54.106 --> 07:55.775
( tokens clattering )

08:04.750 --> 08:06.252
( speaking Japanese )

08:13.659 --> 08:15.628
( all exclaiming )

09:20.259 --> 09:21.694
( Shun grunts )

09:30.602 --> 09:32.805
( Shun groaning )

09:43.715 --> 09:45.918
( Shun groaning )

09:46.718 --> 09:48.287
( Hideto grunts )

10:00.699 --> 10:02.368
( Shun groaning )

10:11.110 --> 10:13.879
-( Hideto shouting )
-( Shun groaning)

10:21.453 --> 10:23.489
( in English ) I'm pretty sure
I told you not to come back.

10:23.522 --> 10:26.125
I felt the whole ship shaking.

10:26.158 --> 10:28.994
-What the hell's going on?
-We're dealing with it.

10:29.027 --> 10:31.731
Seriously? You're not even
going to fill me in?

10:34.333 --> 10:35.801
You're not one of us.

10:36.668 --> 10:38.337
You know,
Logan is still down there.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.374
We'll warn him if we see him.

10:45.544 --> 10:46.746
( pants )

10:50.716 --> 10:51.917
( sighs )

11:06.832 --> 11:08.767
( elevator whooshing )

11:08.801 --> 11:11.003
Why the hell
are they going down?

11:11.036 --> 11:14.372
Do you think
it's got something
to do with that noise?

11:14.406 --> 11:17.743
I don't know.
You should go back
to the Crew's Quarters.

11:17.776 --> 11:19.445
I want to keep working.

11:19.478 --> 11:23.582
No, something might
be going on, okay?
I'd prefer it if you were safe.

11:23.615 --> 11:26.718
Are you worried about me?

11:26.752 --> 11:30.623
Just... Just go
back upstairs, okay?

11:30.656 --> 11:31.857
Fine.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.193
Dad.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.234
automated voice:<i> Ring 10.</i>

11:50.675 --> 11:53.379
Henri: The entire
ring is shaking.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.385
( metal clanking )

12:48.934 --> 12:51.870
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus Christ! Fuck me.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.939
What the fuck are you doing?

12:53.972 --> 12:56.375
I could have smashed
your head in.

12:56.408 --> 12:57.409
And that'd be my fault?

12:59.911 --> 13:01.580
What are you guys
doing down here?

13:01.613 --> 13:04.015
Trying to stop
a breach in Cell 50.

13:04.049 --> 13:07.186
-Wait. A what?
-Shun: We're wasting time.
Let's go.

13:10.589 --> 13:11.824
Hang on a sec.

13:15.928 --> 13:17.463
Logan: Jesus Christ.
( shivering )

13:19.098 --> 13:21.199
Jesus, why is it
so fucking cold?

13:21.232 --> 13:25.004
-Rey: Put these on.
-You should go.

13:25.037 --> 13:27.973
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe I'm sick
of being excluded.

13:28.006 --> 13:30.542
Maybe I wouldn't trust you guys
to patch a fucking tire,

13:30.575 --> 13:32.310
let alone a hole in the ship.

13:32.344 --> 13:35.347
Shun: Let him
help if he wants to.
Just don't hold us up.

13:44.389 --> 13:45.957
( electrical crackling )

13:45.991 --> 13:47.960
( rumbling and creaking )

14:01.440 --> 14:02.974
Rey: Okay, fine.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.377
We need to reapply
the seal around the edges.

14:05.410 --> 14:08.847
Sealant guns. Sprays a fast
adhesive. It's airtight.

14:08.881 --> 14:11.116
Shun: Have you even
used these before?

14:12.250 --> 14:13.651
( scoffs )

14:13.685 --> 14:15.154
Lana: We're starting work, now.

14:17.289 --> 14:18.290
Good luck.

14:19.591 --> 14:21.694
Logan: ( over comms )<i> Give me
one of those. I got it.</i>

14:21.727 --> 14:22.928
Was that Logan?

14:24.363 --> 14:25.564
Logan:<i> I can help.</i>

14:26.498 --> 14:27.967
What the fuck's going on?

14:34.740 --> 14:36.475
( electrical crackling )

14:36.508 --> 14:37.910
( rumbling )

14:38.877 --> 14:40.512
( scanner beeping )

14:47.219 --> 14:48.420
( creaking )

14:49.654 --> 14:51.223
( sealant hissing )

14:56.762 --> 14:58.197
( scanner beeping )

14:58.230 --> 15:00.866
Rey: Okay, guys,
you need to work faster.

15:00.899 --> 15:02.134
Logan: You work faster.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.236
How do we know
if we're covering
the right areas?

15:04.269 --> 15:06.138
Rey: The pressure
will stabilize.

15:07.205 --> 15:08.307
It will.

15:15.514 --> 15:16.916
Logan: Whoa, Doc.

15:17.649 --> 15:19.184
What are you doing?

15:22.988 --> 15:24.423
Rey: Okay, stop.

15:25.724 --> 15:26.992
( breathing heavily )

15:32.097 --> 15:33.899
Henri: Did we do it?

Lana: What?

15:41.607 --> 15:42.608

Logan! Logan! Logan!

16:19.077 --> 16:20.112
( rumbles )

16:20.145 --> 16:22.414
It's going to go.
It's going to go!

16:22.448 --> 16:23.983
Shun: Get to the door!

16:27.553 --> 16:28.820
( wind howling )

-( Logan groans over comms )

18:26.038 --> 18:27.672
Jesus, somebody answer me!

18:27.705 --> 18:29.708
Hey. It's okay.
They're going to be okay.

18:29.741 --> 18:33.311
Katie: You don't know that.
Lee, what's going on
down there?

18:33.345 --> 18:37.015
It's the AI.
It's activating
its own defenses.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.718
automated voice:
<i>Jettison procedure initiated.</i>

18:42.820 --> 18:44.289

-( Logan groaning )

-Lee:<i> Get out of the ring.</i>
-What?

18:51.330 --> 18:52.397
Get out of the ring.

<i> The AI's begun
emergency procedures.</i>

Lee, open the fucking door.

No. What just happened?

I can't cancel
the countdown.

<i> -What's going on?</i>
-Lee, open the door!

19:59.064 --> 20:02.267
I can't. The AI has locked out
all manual control on Ring 10.

-We have to move him.
-Yeah.

20:06.438 --> 20:08.340
He'll die if we don't.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.943
Abigail, prepare
for a transfusion.

20:12.210 --> 20:14.045
Katie, come on.
Let's go.

20:14.078 --> 20:15.513
Come on.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.783
Rey, is there another way back
onto the ship from that ring?

20:17.816 --> 20:19.918
All doors to the spine
will have sealed.

20:19.951 --> 20:22.421
-Fuck!
-Rey: I'm sorry.

20:22.454 --> 20:23.989
( breathing heavily )

20:27.926 --> 20:31.697
Lee will find a way.
She has to.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.864
I need to take Logan.

20:35.533 --> 20:37.369
Go. Go!

20:40.638 --> 20:43.508
-Rey: Henri, we've got
to go. Come on!
-( Logan groaning )

20:52.584 --> 20:53.819
( sniffles )

20:53.852 --> 20:54.786
( breathing heavily )

20:56.320 --> 20:58.857
Lee, how long
until the ring ejects?

21:01.926 --> 21:04.129
Just under 20 minutes.

21:04.162 --> 21:05.530
Lana: ( over comms )<i> Shun.</i>

21:06.665 --> 21:07.666
<i> Talk to me!</i>

21:13.304 --> 21:14.506
<i> Shun.</i>

21:18.143 --> 21:19.578
( exhales )

21:28.386 --> 21:29.921
<i> I don't know how
to get you out.</i>

21:32.757 --> 21:37.529
There has to be a way.
You need to find a way!

21:40.398 --> 21:43.601
I don't want to die
in here, okay?

21:43.635 --> 21:44.703
( sobbing )

21:47.805 --> 21:48.807
Help me.

21:49.774 --> 21:50.942
( water dripping )

22:15.433 --> 22:16.702
( door thuds )

22:21.439 --> 22:22.874
( door opens )

23:05.049 --> 23:06.118
( gunshot )

23:07.886 --> 23:08.887
Shun: No, no!

23:17.896 --> 23:18.930
( speaking Japanese )

23:32.077 --> 23:32.978
( gun cocks )

23:33.979 --> 23:35.013
( Hideto speaking )

23:47.959 --> 23:49.460
( inhales sharply )

23:49.494 --> 23:50.729
( grunts )

23:55.033 --> 23:56.935
( train passing by )

24:01.038 --> 24:02.574
( bottles clinking )

24:08.513 --> 24:09.915

( sniffles )

24:48.052 --> 24:49.154
( sniffles )

24:59.431 --> 25:00.632
Lana: ( in English ) Please.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.268
You need to help me.

25:04.769 --> 25:05.971
( faintly audible ) Please.

25:08.940 --> 25:09.941
Please.

25:12.410 --> 25:14.145
Please help me!

25:14.178 --> 25:15.847
( sniffles ) Fuck!

25:18.182 --> 25:19.651
( grunting )

25:22.320 --> 25:24.021
Lana: You can do this.

25:24.055 --> 25:25.523
( faintly audible )
There has to be a way out.
There has to be a way. Come on.

25:25.556 --> 25:27.092
Come on.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.760
( breathing heavily )

25:42.039 --> 25:45.710
Lee. Lee, there's no way back
from inside the ring,

25:45.743 --> 25:48.012
<i> but what about from outside?</i>

25:48.045 --> 25:48.879
What?

25:48.913 --> 25:50.714
Shun:<i> When the ring detaches,</i>

25:50.748 --> 25:52.817
this airlock will open
onto space, won't it?

25:52.850 --> 25:57.355
I guess, in theory,
but Ring 10 is in lockdown.
She can't unseal the doors.

25:57.388 --> 25:59.324
She doesn't have to.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.393
There's another exit.

26:02.426 --> 26:03.962
Cell 50.

26:09.167 --> 26:11.536
-Lana, the impact point.
-Yeah? ( sniffles )

26:11.569 --> 26:12.904
You're going to jump through.

26:14.305 --> 26:17.008
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

26:17.042 --> 26:19.477
You can't just leap into space.
It'll kill you.

26:19.510 --> 26:21.880
So, find her some protection!

26:22.714 --> 26:24.415
That's your plan?

26:24.448 --> 26:26.251
Fuck!

26:26.284 --> 26:27.852
( door rattles, opens )

26:29.187 --> 26:30.321
( all grunting )

26:30.355 --> 26:31.523
Shit. What happened?

26:31.556 --> 26:33.358
There's a breach
in Ring 10.

26:33.391 --> 26:35.860
We were nearly pulled
out of the ship.

26:35.893 --> 26:38.462
Just give him here!
Give him here!

26:38.496 --> 26:39.731
Lee: ( over comms )<i> Rey.</i>

26:40.698 --> 26:42.500
<i> -Rey!</i>
-Hello?

26:42.533 --> 26:45.637
Are there any suits
for if any of you ever
went outside the ship?

26:45.670 --> 26:48.773
Yes, uh, there were a few
for the senior engineers.

26:48.806 --> 26:50.174
Shun:<i> Where are they?</i>

26:50.208 --> 26:52.811
<i> Um, outside Cell 49,
in the storage unit.</i>

26:55.513 --> 26:57.781
-Lana.
-( faintly audible ) Fuck.

26:57.815 --> 27:00.385
Lana! Listen to me. Lana!

27:02.420 --> 27:04.289
Find one. Get to the breach.

27:05.923 --> 27:08.426
When the ring goes,
you're going to jump through.

27:08.459 --> 27:10.395
I can't do that.

27:10.428 --> 27:14.098
-You have to!
-I'm not a fucking
astronaut, Shun!

27:14.132 --> 27:16.768
You said
you didn't want to die!

27:18.036 --> 27:20.105
That's still true,
isn't it?

27:22.373 --> 27:23.675
Yeah.

27:24.341 --> 27:26.778
Yeah. Okay. ( sniffles )

27:28.713 --> 27:30.080
( exhales )

27:30.114 --> 27:31.216
Go.

27:33.284 --> 27:35.452
Lana. Lana.

27:35.486 --> 27:36.755
Go!

27:47.198 --> 27:49.367
( exhales and sniffles )

27:54.939 --> 27:58.076
Lee, how long until
the jettison happens?

27:59.978 --> 28:03.648
We hit 15 in three, two...

28:03.681 --> 28:05.950
-One.
-( timer beeps )

28:25.203 --> 28:27.071
Abigail: ( over comms )
<i> Henri, we're out of plasma.</i>

28:27.105 --> 28:28.906
Then one of us
will have to give him blood.

28:28.939 --> 28:30.442
Neither of us
know his blood type.

28:32.143 --> 28:35.045
We didn't discuss
each other's blood.

28:35.079 --> 28:37.782
Abigail:<i> We can't give him
a transfusion without knowing.</i>

28:37.815 --> 28:39.050
It could kill him.

28:41.519 --> 28:43.188
( Logan groaning )

28:43.788 --> 28:45.290
Shun, I've got to go.

28:45.924 --> 28:48.692
No, wait. I need you.

28:48.726 --> 28:50.561
There's nothing I can
do for you here.

28:50.594 --> 28:52.964
<i>I'm sorry. I hope you make it.</i>

28:54.165 --> 28:55.166
Thanks.

29:03.807 --> 29:05.210
( pouring drink )

29:08.446 --> 29:10.048
( speaking Japanese )

29:15.186 --> 29:16.287
( chuckles )

29:39.476 --> 29:40.879
( laughs )

30:38.502 --> 30:39.404
( exhales )

31:06.797 --> 31:08.199
( shouting in Japanese )

31:10.768 --> 31:12.170
( muffled grunting )

31:17.341 --> 31:19.043
( Eiichi grunting )

31:35.360 --> 31:37.362
(cellphone ringing )

31:43.868 --> 31:45.270
( Shun speaking on phone )

32:05.489 --> 32:06.624
( Eiichi screaming )

32:08.359 --> 32:09.560
( groaning )

32:37.755 --> 32:39.757
Oye! Kenzaki!

32:39.790 --> 32:40.791
( Eiichi groans )

32:40.824 --> 32:42.026
<i> Kenzaki--</i>

32:51.635 --> 32:53.037
( scanner beeps )

32:59.911 --> 33:01.245
( in English ) Fuck.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.732
He's lost
so much blood, Henri.

33:21.632 --> 33:23.201
I know.

33:23.234 --> 33:25.102
What are we going to do?

33:25.135 --> 33:27.371
We can't let him die.

33:27.405 --> 33:28.606
( EKG beeping )

33:32.243 --> 33:35.880
-What are you doing?
-Abigail, get me
an intravenous line.

33:35.913 --> 33:38.115
I will give him
the transfusion myself.

33:38.149 --> 33:39.584
How do you know
you're a match?

33:39.617 --> 33:41.219
I'm O-positive,

33:41.252 --> 33:43.220
the most common type.

33:43.253 --> 33:45.456
Around 40% of people
have the same.

33:45.489 --> 33:48.392
That means that 60%
of people don't.

33:48.426 --> 33:50.761
You can't take a fucking guess
on his life.

33:50.795 --> 33:53.664
Katie, he's dying, anyway.

34:02.706 --> 34:03.941
( device beeps )

34:03.974 --> 34:06.844
-Come on. Come on.
-( tool clatters )

34:06.877 --> 34:08.479
( beeping )

34:08.512 --> 34:09.547
Fuck!

34:21.124 --> 34:23.161
Lee: ( over comms )
<i> Is anyone there?</i>

34:24.795 --> 34:26.230
-Lee?
-Lee:<i> A-negative.</i>

34:26.263 --> 34:28.399
<i> Logan's blood type
is A-negative.</i>

34:28.432 --> 34:30.134
What? How could you know that?

34:30.168 --> 34:31.869
<i> He told me.</i>

34:31.902 --> 34:33.571
When? When did you two--

34:33.604 --> 34:38.909
<i>You're seriously going to
interrogate me right now?
He's A-fucking-negative.</i>

34:38.942 --> 34:41.612
<i> Come on, Katie,
just believe me.</i>

34:42.446 --> 34:44.648
-Can I trust you?
<i> -Yeah.</i>

34:44.682 --> 34:46.016
<i> I swear.</i>

34:46.049 --> 34:48.118
A-negative.

34:48.152 --> 34:50.254
-Logan's A-negative.
-How did you find that out?

34:50.287 --> 34:51.789
It doesn't matter.
Does anybody have
that blood type?

35:02.466 --> 35:04.635
I guess that's what
they call "irony."

35:07.571 --> 35:08.673
( panting )

35:14.411 --> 35:16.114
-( rumbling )
-( gasping )

35:17.848 --> 35:19.350
( breathing heavily )

35:20.084 --> 35:22.285
Shun, I got a suit.

35:22.319 --> 35:27.225
Shun:<i> Good. Good.
You've got eight minutes to
get to the breach. Hurry.</i>

35:40.904 --> 35:41.906
Psst!

35:45.008 --> 35:46.577
I'm glad you're willing
to trust me.

35:48.279 --> 35:50.647
You just seemed so convinced
I was a bad person,

35:50.681 --> 35:53.750
someone you wanted
to keep Logan away from.

35:53.784 --> 35:56.387
And now, I'm the only one
who can save his life.

35:59.557 --> 36:03.761
Provided I'm telling
the truth, of course.

36:07.865 --> 36:09.366
He's lying.

36:09.399 --> 36:11.501
-What?
-Take it out.

36:11.535 --> 36:13.904
-Take it out!
He's fucking lying!
-Abigail: Stop!

36:13.937 --> 36:15.106
He wants to kill him.

36:15.139 --> 36:16.707
The blood is already in.

36:18.276 --> 36:21.345
Baum, swear to us
you're A-negative.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.183
Cross my heart,

36:26.016 --> 36:27.218
hope to die.

36:48.972 --> 36:50.575
( breathing shakily )

( Lana sobbing )

37:49.266 --> 37:50.801
<i> I can't do this.</i>

37:50.835 --> 37:52.436
Yes, you can.

37:52.469 --> 37:55.405
I can't do this. I can't.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.942
Lana, you're the most fearless
person I've ever met!

38:02.079 --> 38:03.748
( hyperventilating )

38:06.316 --> 38:08.819
( sobs ) You don't know me.

38:09.820 --> 38:11.489
So tell me something.

38:12.022 --> 38:13.991
Tell... ( sighs )

38:14.025 --> 38:15.626
Tell me about
where you grew up.

38:16.026 --> 38:17.694
What?

38:17.728 --> 38:20.398
Shun:<i> What was the house like?</i>

38:20.431 --> 38:22.533
<i> Were you happy?</i>

38:24.267 --> 38:25.870
My house...

38:26.971 --> 38:28.439
( gasping )

38:38.515 --> 38:43.387
It was... It was by a lake.

38:45.856 --> 38:46.924
( sniffles )

38:48.391 --> 38:52.963
On hot days,
me and my brother
would jump in.

38:54.431 --> 38:56.767
I didn't know you had
a brother. ( sniffles )

38:56.800 --> 38:57.968
What was his name?

39:04.775 --> 39:05.976
Sam.

39:09.947 --> 39:10.981
( sniffles )

39:11.015 --> 39:14.285
Okay, you jumped in the lake
when you were a kid.

39:14.318 --> 39:15.820
This is just the same.

39:21.926 --> 39:23.494
You'll be there? ( sobs )

39:31.301 --> 39:33.037
( sniffles ) I promise.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.575
( softly )
Okay. You'll be there.

Thank you.

Thank you for trying
to save me.

46:13.370 --> 46:14.705
( winces )

46:14.738 --> 46:16.140
( vehicle approaches )

46:18.741 --> 46:20.244
( groaning )

47:10.961 --> 47:13.030
( sniffling )

47:27.944 --> 47:29.346
( panting )

47:29.846 --> 47:31.281
( Hideto laughing )

47:39.323 --> 47:40.290
( Hideto speaking )

47:43.727 --> 47:44.962
( grunts )

48:19.896 --> 48:21.131
( chuckles )

48:32.075 --> 48:33.577
( bullet shell clatters )

48:35.045 --> 48:37.180
( screaming )

48:42.852 --> 48:44.554
( Eiichi sobbing )

48:58.901 --> 49:00.270
( whimpers )

49:10.780 --> 49:12.049
( sobbing )

50:55.819 --> 50:57.287
( in English )
You saved my life.

51:33.723 --> 51:35.192
How's he doing?

51:36.092 --> 51:37.661
Henri says he's stable.

51:39.162 --> 51:40.464
Thanks to you.

51:42.732 --> 51:46.269
And Baum. Annoyingly.

51:50.873 --> 51:52.142
How did you know?

51:52.842 --> 51:53.844
I can't say.

52:00.282 --> 52:01.685
Can I have a second with him?

52:03.753 --> 52:04.788
Yeah.

52:06.856 --> 52:08.291
I'll come back later.

52:31.313 --> 52:33.316
You were right about the lens.

52:35.317 --> 52:37.454
Basically saved your own life.

52:40.022 --> 52:41.658
You know, I used
to really hate you.

52:42.258 --> 52:43.827
You're such a fucking prick.

52:44.860 --> 52:47.330
But... I don't know.

52:48.031 --> 52:49.466
Now, you're...

52:50.433 --> 52:54.371
Kind of the only person
I can trust here.

53:06.415 --> 53:08.418
I've got the data, Logan.

53:10.053 --> 53:11.587
We can find out
who's infected.

53:11.621 --> 53:13.523
I just need you
to wake up.

53:15.025 --> 53:17.260
Wake up and help me.

53:24.234 --> 53:25.535
( sighs )

53:28.070 --> 53:29.372
( sniffles )

53:32.875 --> 53:34.444
( knocking on door )

53:45.221 --> 53:46.523
( door opens )

53:52.929 --> 53:54.231
I'm sorry.

53:58.201 --> 53:59.970
I didn't want to be alone.

54:15.051 --> 54:16.653
( door closes)

55:15.444 --> 55:17.681
-( groaning )
-( door opens and closes )

56:06.295 --> 56:07.430
( whimpers )

56:07.463 --> 56:09.065
Lee... ( grunts )

56:10.132 --> 56:11.768
Lee, is that you?

56:15.238 --> 56:16.639
( Logan groans )

56:30.820 --> 56:32.455
( both screaming )

56:38.094 --> 56:41.798
( shouting ) Inside!
