00:03.404 --> 00:07.341
In September, 2017,
Hurricane Maria devastated

00:07.375 --> 00:09.843
the American island
of Puerto Rico.

00:09.877 --> 00:13.214
At the time of this writing
12 days after the hurricane,

00:13.247 --> 00:15.716
almost 95% of the island's
residents

00:15.749 --> 00:17.351
are still without power,

00:17.385 --> 00:20.688
and close to half don't have
clean water.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.690
Just months prior, we shot an
episode there

00:22.723 --> 00:25.526
hoping to capture the
staggering economic crisis

00:25.559 --> 00:28.362
that Puerto Ricans were
already dealing with.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.764
So now we have to ask ourselves,

00:30.798 --> 00:33.101
can the island ever rebuild,

00:33.134 --> 00:36.204
and what is our responsibility
as Americans

00:36.237 --> 00:39.073
in making that a reality?

01:48.442 --> 01:51.479
Puerto Rico:
it's America, right?

01:51.512 --> 01:55.916
It's ours,
and we've held on to it,

01:55.949 --> 01:58.186
fiercely at times, since 1898

01:58.219 --> 02:00.288

02:27.215 --> 02:28.649
Over the last ten years,
more than

02:28.682 --> 02:32.186
5% of the population has fled.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.826
But what's it like
for Puerto Ricans,

02:40.694 --> 02:43.030
whose families have lived here

02:43.063 --> 02:46.467
Many have left for
an easier life in the States.

More keep leaving...
but not all.

Laura Moscoso

of a situation

03:55.636 --> 03:58.306
that seems Kafka-esque at best.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.808
So dumb question.
What is Puerto Rico?

04:00.841 --> 04:02.476
It's not a state.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.312
It's kind of like a colony,
but it's not.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.079
It's not kind.
It is.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.448
It is a colony.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.417
It's an unincorporated
territory.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.984
"Unincorporated territory."

04:11.018 --> 04:12.620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.922
So, you know, what's that?
What is that?

04:14.955 --> 04:17.925
We're still trying to
figure out sometimes, you know?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.726
Would you say the majority
of Puerto Ricans

04:19.760 --> 04:21.762
consider themselves Americans?

04:21.795 --> 04:23.790
Or do they consider themselves
Puerto Ricans or both?

04:23.797 --> 04:26.133
I think that they
consider theirself Puerto Ricans

04:26.166 --> 04:29.670
with the privilege of having
the United States citizenship.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.772
Yeah, but it's kind of
a half-ass citizenship.

04:31.805 --> 04:32.940
Can't vote for president.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.241
Nor Congress.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.476
- Or Congress.
- Anything.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.910
You don't really have much voice

04:36.944 --> 04:38.346
in your own destiny.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.013
Exactly.
You can only go to war.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.949
That's the only thing
that you can do with right.

04:41.982 --> 04:47.020
Right. But Puerto Rico owes,
what, $75 billion right now?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.856
- 72, yeah.
- 72.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.190
I don't see statehood.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.192
I don't see Congress or Senate
ever...

04:52.225 --> 04:53.594
Me neither.

04:53.627 --> 04:57.197
Ever taking on
a $72 billion debt load,

04:57.230 --> 04:59.132
especially for a lot of people
who speak Spanish.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.434
Exactly.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.169
What's the way out of this?

05:02.202 --> 05:04.472
Oh, my God.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.106
What about tourism?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.975
It's an industry of services

05:08.008 --> 05:10.544
to service the wealthy.

05:10.578 --> 05:13.146
And then at the same time,
you take $450 million

05:13.180 --> 05:14.815
out of the university,
for example,

05:14.848 --> 05:17.551
so you're gonna have
less educated people

05:17.585 --> 05:20.220
willing to do any type
of work...

05:20.253 --> 05:21.855
To survive.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.324
You are not really
producing an economy

05:24.358 --> 05:27.327
that a person can survive in,
you know?

05:27.361 --> 05:29.797
This is a country
where people live,

05:29.830 --> 05:31.298
where we do things.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.502
And we have culture
and literature and music

05:34.535 --> 05:36.970
and produce intellectual,
important work.

05:37.004 --> 05:41.074
They are selling us
as only a good resort

05:41.108 --> 05:45.579
to have a piña colada
in the beach and that's it.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.181
We actually invented
piña coladas, so...

05:52.686 --> 05:57.858
Even though we are, like,
getting over by...

05:57.891 --> 06:00.528
- Vultures.
- Yeah, a lot of vultures.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.096
The people of Puerto Rico
are good people,

06:03.130 --> 06:07.635
and I think that we are gonna
get past this.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.077
The situation here
is truly grave.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.880
So how exactly did Puerto Rico
find itself

06:19.913 --> 06:24.051
so deeply and seemingly
irrevocably screwed?

06:25.953 --> 06:27.721
In the early '70s,

06:27.755 --> 06:29.590
things were looking
pretty good for Puerto Rico.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.725
A tax incentive was introduced,

06:31.759 --> 06:34.728
which helped lure dozens of
major companies to the island,

06:34.762 --> 06:37.731
employing significant numbers
of people.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.437
But when that incentive
expired in 2006,

06:43.471 --> 06:46.039
concurrent with a major
recession in the States,

06:46.073 --> 06:49.142
those companies packed up
and left.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.244
Thousands of Puerto Ricans
followed,

06:51.278 --> 06:56.884
looking for jobs that no
longer existed on the island.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.453
The tax base shrunk drastically,

06:59.487 --> 07:01.455
creating a dire need for cash

07:01.489 --> 07:04.758
to shore up basic needs
and services.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.928
So along came
the municipal bond,

07:07.961 --> 07:12.666
a big, fat IOU
that appeared to be salvation

07:12.700 --> 07:14.902
for a near-broke government.

07:14.935 --> 07:19.473
They're sexy for investors,
triple exempt from taxes,

07:19.507 --> 07:22.075
and bond owners
buying Puerto Rican debt

07:22.109 --> 07:27.948
would have to be paid back
before anyone.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.416
That's anyone.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.519
Hedge funds, or vulture funds,

07:31.552 --> 07:33.954
as they are often referred to
in these cases,

07:33.987 --> 07:36.790
had profited from
similarly desperate situations

07:36.824 --> 07:39.960
in Greece, Argentina,
and Detroit.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.496
As the situation worsened
for Puerto Rico,

07:42.530 --> 07:44.297
you could buy up
more and more bonds

07:44.331 --> 07:46.033
for pennies on the dollar.

07:46.066 --> 07:50.904
This was a fire sale
too sweet to pass up.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.375
And the resulting
insurmountable debt,

07:55.408 --> 07:58.445
it means drastic
austerity measures

07:58.478 --> 08:00.313
determined by an unelected board

08:00.347 --> 08:03.884
who have near absolute power
to raise taxes;

08:03.917 --> 08:05.886
empty teachers' pension plans;

08:05.919 --> 08:08.789
close down schools, hospitals;

08:08.822 --> 08:11.625
basically squeeze every dollar
out of Puerto Rico

08:11.659 --> 08:13.794
to pay back the funds.

08:13.827 --> 08:18.832
Every Puerto Rican is being
made to feel the pain.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.170
I mean, I know
schools are closing, yes?

08:23.203 --> 08:25.072
Last year, 240 schools closed.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.721
- Last year alone.
- In the last two years.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.709
This year, there's a list
of 300 schools

08:28.742 --> 08:31.645
that are "in risk"
of shutting down.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.179
Born in Puerto Rico?

08:33.212 --> 08:34.240
I was born in Chicago, Illinois.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.248
In Chicago.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.515
My family came back

08:36.549 --> 08:38.686
mostly because
our family was here.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.421
Puerto Ricans want the family
to stick together.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.756
If you can live
close to each other,

08:43.791 --> 08:44.925
the better.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.326
I decided to stay,

08:46.359 --> 08:48.896
because I wanted my kids
to grow up here.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.163
Better times.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.198
Better times, of course.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.532
What changed?

08:52.566 --> 08:54.702
The government took
too much in loans

08:54.735 --> 08:56.503
and couldn't pay them back.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.873
So they kept putting taxes
on the people,

08:59.907 --> 09:02.009
the working-class people
like me,

09:02.042 --> 09:04.377
and we cannot pay them.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.079
Like many professionals here,

09:06.113 --> 09:08.548
Liza-Marie Cordova
would probably have

09:08.582 --> 09:10.684
an easier time of it
in the States.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.586
But she chooses to stay.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.187
With the crisis
here in Puerto Rico,

09:14.221 --> 09:17.124
mostly I think about my kids.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.260
Will they have the options
to stay here

09:20.293 --> 09:24.665
and work and have a family?

09:29.136 --> 09:30.604
Okay, so where are we?

09:30.638 --> 09:32.773
We are at Casa Vieja in Ciales.

09:32.806 --> 09:37.410
This is a typical 1960, '50
grandmother's house.

09:37.444 --> 09:40.714
And the food is grandma food?

09:40.748 --> 09:43.383
It is grandma food, actually.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.786
Those are corn fritters
with ham.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.255
Typical Sunday
after Saturday party.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.489
Hangover food.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.590
Delicious.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.459
Thank you.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.261
So this is like a plantain soup.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.896
Mmm.
Ooh, that's good.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.598
The specialty here
is pastel al caldero,

09:58.632 --> 10:01.134
pork marinated in bitter orange,

10:01.168 --> 10:05.005
taro root, green plantains,
squash,

10:05.038 --> 10:08.575
and garbanzo beans slow cooked.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.279
And morcilla, blood sausage,

10:12.312 --> 10:14.915
one of my favorite things.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.616
Is good?

10:16.650 --> 10:18.852
It's fantastic.

10:18.886 --> 10:22.856
Teachers here are being asked
to pay into a pension system

10:22.890 --> 10:25.993
that has been described
as a Ponzi scheme.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.129
You pay 10% of your income
into your pension plan

10:29.162 --> 10:30.630
out of every paycheck.

10:30.664 --> 10:31.818
The money you're paying in now

10:31.832 --> 10:33.600
is being used to pay...

10:33.633 --> 10:35.057
The ones that are retired
right now.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.770
The ones who are
retiring right now:

10:36.804 --> 10:38.806
in a pyramid scheme,
the top of the pyramid.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.373
But by the time
it gets down to you,

10:40.407 --> 10:42.776
who've been paying in
for your entire life...

10:42.810 --> 10:44.277
There's no money left.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.679
I worry about my future.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.815
I don't know
what I'm gonna live off.

10:47.848 --> 10:51.151
I have two jobs
in order to pay my bills,

10:51.184 --> 10:54.221
have my car, have my house,
pay for my kids' education.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.655
Right.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.150
There's no way,
with one job as a teacher,

10:57.157 --> 10:58.225
I can do that.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.727
So how do you continue?

10:59.760 --> 11:02.562
I know I could get paid triple
in the States.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.631
But I don't want
to give up my country.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.500
My kids see
how their parents struggle.

11:07.534 --> 11:10.503
Things can change
if only one stands up

11:10.537 --> 11:12.172
and decides,
"I'm gonna do this."

11:12.205 --> 11:13.506
Right.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.035
But we have to empower
those children.

11:15.042 --> 11:18.011
We have to make them believe
they can change it,

11:18.045 --> 11:19.679
that there's a better life
for them.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.081
And I'm getting emotional,

11:21.114 --> 11:25.252
because sometimes I feel
that I've failed.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.520
I cannot save all of them.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.156
That's the truth.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.059
But I can save a lot,

11:32.092 --> 11:33.693
and that's my job.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.829
So that's what I'm going to do.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.230
I have hope.
I have faith.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.767
I'm taking a jump of faith.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.085
I knew the necessity...
Right.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.388
There was in the restaurant
for good-quality sausages.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.891
So I put my little kitchen
to make the experiment,

15:24.924 --> 15:26.793
and I worked over that.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.761
Where were they getting
their sausage before you?

15:28.795 --> 15:30.297
Yeah, from the mountains.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.099
From the mountains.
Oh, under the table.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.766
Yeah, but under the table.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.436
They were not inspectioned

Can you use entirely
Puerto Rican products?

15:39.472 --> 15:40.773
I'm in the process.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.609
I use the pork shoulder,

15:42.642 --> 15:44.444
and there is nobody
in Puerto Rico

15:44.477 --> 15:45.778
that produce that.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.415
Now, that's [...] up,
right?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.317
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.619
I mean, the Spanish generally
brought pigs with them.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.254
Yeah.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.049
You can certainly
raise pigs here, no problem.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.590
There's the land for it.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.292
Why is no one raising pigs
in Puerto Rico?

15:59.326 --> 16:02.095
90% of the pork meat
in Puerto Rico

16:02.129 --> 16:03.830
is come from the States.

16:03.863 --> 16:06.599
Our prices
is very hard to compete.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.001
But that is changing.

16:08.035 --> 16:12.005
We still have the resources
and the talent.

16:12.039 --> 16:15.308
That is the most powerful tool
that we got,

16:15.342 --> 16:18.611
the talent that... you know,
to see an opportunity

16:18.645 --> 16:20.147
and working forward to that.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.483
We have a great generation
of young agriculturists

16:23.516 --> 16:26.319
that instead of going from
the countryside to the city

16:26.353 --> 16:29.322
to work in a bank
or some big companies,

16:29.356 --> 16:32.025
they're going back
to the countryside, you know?

16:32.059 --> 16:34.461
They don't need nobody to tell,

16:34.494 --> 16:35.495
"Hey, you can do it."

16:35.528 --> 16:36.663
They just make the click.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.331
So there's hope.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.501
Yeah, humbly, I can say
me and my family are an example

16:41.534 --> 16:47.174
of what you can do
with the tools you got.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.976
- Well said, man.
- Yeah.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.411
These are delicious.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.679
- You can squeeze...
- Yeah.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.247
A little like that.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.015
Yeah, believe me.
That used to be my job.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.185
I used to have to squeeze
all the lobster legs

16:58.218 --> 16:59.486
with a rolling pin.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.221
Oh!

17:10.262 --> 17:14.166
Puerto Rico is still
unarguably rich in one thing:

17:14.201 --> 17:16.069
natural splendor.

17:18.070 --> 17:21.340
Beautiful views.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.377
Unspoiled coastline.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.714
But that, too, is in peril.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.549
My name is Pocho.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.852
I was born and raised
in Aguadilla.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.855
This space is so special
to me personally,

17:35.888 --> 17:37.424
because, yes, I'm a surfer,

17:37.457 --> 17:39.392
and I've been surfing here
all my life.

17:39.426 --> 17:43.230
I want my son to be able
to keep coming here.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.699
It's so open,

17:46.733 --> 17:50.470
so free
of all of these pollutions,

17:50.503 --> 17:53.005
all this mayhem.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.283
Pocho and his fellow activists

18:03.316 --> 18:05.051
have occupied Playuela,

18:05.084 --> 18:06.753
trying to serve as human shields

18:06.786 --> 18:09.556
against the encroachment
of a planned development

18:09.589 --> 18:12.259
that would transform this
place into a massive resort

18:12.292 --> 18:15.128
named, appropriately
or inappropriately enough,

18:15.162 --> 18:17.497
after Christopher Columbus.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.100
This is a resistant town.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.769
Just a hypothetical question.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.297
If the beach is public,
what's the problem?

18:24.304 --> 18:25.905
The project.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.241
It's not a building;
it's a megaproject.

18:28.275 --> 18:32.312
It's a five-star hotel,
120 villas, a mini mall.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.980
"The biggest casino
in the Caribbean"...

18:34.013 --> 18:35.348
That's how they sell it.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.917
And two parking lots
four stories high.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.519
We're talking, like,
poof, poof, poof,

18:39.552 --> 18:41.988
poof, poof, poof, poof,
poof... you know?

18:42.021 --> 18:43.423
It's not sustainable.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.192
If they roll in
the bulldozers right now

18:45.225 --> 18:46.719
with a whole bunch of police,
what do you do?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.127
Civil disobedience.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.596
We go stop
in front of the machines,

18:49.629 --> 18:51.798
and we'll give them time
for the lawyers

18:51.831 --> 18:52.825
to do their case in the court

18:52.832 --> 18:54.033
and whatnot and whatnot.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.302
Oh, you got some lawyers here.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.803
Yeah, I got all the lawyers.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.038
- Lawyers go to the beach?
- Yes, man, hey.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.842
The chef is making sancocho,

19:02.875 --> 19:07.046
the stew of beef, veal,
and sausages.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.818
And there's
some fresh-caught grouper

19:11.851 --> 19:13.753
and red snapper.

19:19.926 --> 19:23.330
There aren't many places left
like this; that's the point.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.198
That's worth something.
Yeah, exactly.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.659
The tourism business
in the Caribbean

19:26.666 --> 19:28.668
is going through
a lot of changes.

19:28.701 --> 19:32.171
In the short term,
developers and construction

19:32.205 --> 19:34.073
get paid a lot of money
for pouring concrete.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.509
But everybody's gonna be going
to Cuba in a few years.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.177
Why?
Because it's unspoiled.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.912
They haven't [...] it up yet.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.549
So that's why we have to start
talking the same language.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.750
You said it, profit.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.151
They talk profit, right?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.019
Let's show them
that there is profit

19:47.053 --> 19:48.355
is nature unspoiled.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.857
That reef back there provides us

19:50.890 --> 19:53.526
with millions of dollars' worth
of services:

19:53.560 --> 19:57.664
fish, tourism, protection
from hurricanes annually.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.367
That produces a service to us
as a community.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.001
So if you all of a sudden
destroy it,

20:02.034 --> 20:03.536
you start losing money.

20:03.570 --> 20:07.540
Could you conceivably settle
for a revised project,

20:07.574 --> 20:10.610
meaning, okay, no casino,
no giant hotel?

20:10.643 --> 20:13.513
An eco lodge
for super-rich people.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.715
In Nicaragua, they have
a lot of these things

20:15.748 --> 20:17.717
that are developed
around communities.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.919
Costa Rica, you know,
and places like that, you know,

20:19.952 --> 20:23.022
the government is conscious
about the environment

20:23.055 --> 20:24.557
and the amount of money

20:24.591 --> 20:26.051
that that environment
and the ecosystem brings

20:26.058 --> 20:27.560
to the economy.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.289
Do you have any faith
in your government at all?

20:29.296 --> 20:30.297
- No.
- No.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.598
We are a colony.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.533
We are an island
surrounded by water,

20:33.566 --> 20:36.536
and we don't produce
almost, like, 90%

20:36.569 --> 20:38.104
of the things we consume,

20:38.137 --> 20:39.639
which makes us needy.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.742
It makes us
a third-world country.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.111
Third-world country
which belongs

20:45.144 --> 20:47.246
to the most powerful nation.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.648
There's a lot of motivation

20:48.681 --> 20:50.283
in the people of Puerto Rico
right now.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.619
It's not about independence
or not.

20:52.652 --> 20:57.089
It's about what is right,
what the people needs.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.758
It's coming out of
the comfort shell

20:58.791 --> 21:01.160
and realizing that if you
don't do anything right now,

21:01.193 --> 21:02.795
we're just gonna get run over.

22:07.994 --> 22:08.494
♪

22:21.608 --> 22:24.176
This tradition probably goes
all the way back.

22:24.210 --> 22:26.212
Oh, look at that.

22:27.514 --> 22:33.252
As old-school and as awesome
as it gets.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.321
A timeless classic,

22:35.354 --> 22:37.524
something that's been good
forever.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.925
The baby's in the house.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.660
- Pretty.
- Beautiful, huh?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.328
A great idea that will never be

22:42.361 --> 22:44.363
anything less than great.

22:44.397 --> 22:49.235
Put a pig on a stick,
and turn him slowly, slowly

22:49.268 --> 22:50.937
over a low fire.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.778
Want some of the skin?

22:58.811 --> 23:00.379
Oh, hell, yeah.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.883
- Cheers.
- Mm.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.052
25 minutes up into the hills
from San Juan,

23:06.085 --> 23:09.221
an institution
that celebrates pork,

23:09.255 --> 23:10.890
the whole damn pig,

23:10.923 --> 23:15.361
in ways that can only be
described as spiritual.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.264
He's a Puerto Rican samurai.

23:18.297 --> 23:20.132
He's incredible.

23:20.166 --> 23:23.803
Lechonera El Rancho de Apa
is one of many such places.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.105
But this one?

23:26.138 --> 23:28.775
This one is special.

23:30.142 --> 23:33.580
Apa Ramos has, for nearly
50 years of his life,

23:33.613 --> 23:35.247
been perfecting the art

23:35.281 --> 23:38.951
of the perfect slow-roasted
suckling pig.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.490
He starts work at 4:00 a.m.

23:47.460 --> 23:51.430
It takes six hours on the
slowly, slowly turning spit

23:51.464 --> 23:53.466
to get it right.

23:53.500 --> 23:58.938
Good knowledge, rotation,
fire, time,

23:58.971 --> 24:00.607
mastering the heat,

24:00.640 --> 24:02.909
because there is
no thermometer or anything.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.778
And you can see, like,
it's really crispy

24:05.812 --> 24:08.014
because still
really, really juicy.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.450
Mmm.
Mmm.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.285
It's incredible.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.087
Well, what's that?
That looks...

24:15.121 --> 24:16.322
- That's stew.
- Right.

24:16.355 --> 24:17.624
And it use all the inner parts.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.125
It's one of my favorites.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.927
Apa's sister, Rosa Maria,

24:20.960 --> 24:23.963
begins her day making
gandinga, a traditional stew

24:23.996 --> 24:27.567
made from pigs' heart, liver,
and kidneys.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.970
That's really nice.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.338
Now, how's business?

24:32.371 --> 24:33.973
'Cause the economy
has been tough.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.341
Do lechoneras feel it,

24:35.374 --> 24:36.636
or people are always
gonna buy that?

24:36.643 --> 24:38.144
Everybody has felt it:

24:38.177 --> 24:40.513
the lechoneras, restaurants,
food trucks, everybody.

24:40.547 --> 24:43.182
But whole hog is, like,
more a family gathering.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.884
This is something so classic,

24:44.917 --> 24:47.386
I think that they're the least
gonna feel it.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.522
Chef Xavier Pacheco

24:49.556 --> 24:52.058
favors Puerto Rican dishes
and ingredients

24:52.091 --> 24:54.226
that have been largely
forgotten.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.729
When you go to another place
and they tell you,

24:56.763 --> 24:58.898
"Yeah, yeah,
I went to McDonald's

24:58.931 --> 25:00.633
when I went to Puerto Rico,"
that sucks.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.368
I hate that,

25:02.401 --> 25:05.638
because we have a lot
of really good stuff here,

25:05.672 --> 25:08.541
and it's our job
to keep it alive

25:08.575 --> 25:10.877
and show it to the world
and say,

25:10.910 --> 25:14.614
"Hey, we are more
than a fast food."

25:15.548 --> 25:18.250
We got to go back to farming.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.345
'Cause you don't want to be
buying everything from imports.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.688
Of course.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.355
In my restaurant,
I started six years ago

25:23.389 --> 25:24.857
with just two farmers.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.226
Now we have more than
15, 16 farmers.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.661
It's like a chain.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.496
You go to many farmers,
and you ask, like,

25:30.529 --> 25:31.557
"This type
of root vegetable."

25:31.564 --> 25:33.165
And they don't have it,

25:33.199 --> 25:35.868
because people stopped buying
the local root vegetable,

25:35.902 --> 25:38.838
because the imported one
is a whole lot cheaper,

25:38.871 --> 25:40.539
and that's all they have
in their mind.

25:40.573 --> 25:43.109
But if you go to a farmer
and you tell the farmer,

25:43.142 --> 25:44.777
"I'm gonna buy your product,"

25:44.811 --> 25:47.446
the farmer is gonna start
having the product.

25:47.479 --> 25:48.741
"Pay more" is a hard argument
to make

25:48.748 --> 25:50.082
when people are struggling.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.851
But if we don't change
our mind, Tony,

25:51.884 --> 25:53.613
I don't know what's gonna happen
with the island.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.087
Do people listen if you say,

25:55.121 --> 25:56.589
"Look, it's not
particularly patriotic;

25:56.623 --> 25:58.190
"you're not helping your country

25:58.224 --> 25:59.985
by eating at McDonald's
or shopping at Walmart"?

25:59.992 --> 26:01.628
Uh, yes.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.129
Yeah?

26:03.162 --> 26:04.797
But like I tell you, Tony,

26:04.831 --> 26:07.199
we have a lot of different types
of Puerto Ricans.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.469
We have Puerto Rican that,
"Yes, I love my island,"

26:10.502 --> 26:12.071
but they don't think more ahead.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.373
They simply think,
"I'm happy with what I have."

26:14.406 --> 26:15.708
The other type of Puerto Rican,

26:15.742 --> 26:17.409
they know
that it's gonna be hard,

26:17.443 --> 26:20.613
but they want to grow,
want to keep learning,

26:20.647 --> 26:22.081
want to stay here,

26:22.114 --> 26:23.816
want to develop what they have
in the island.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.110
This is a good argument
for it, man.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.152
This is incredible.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.286
Yeah, yeah.

26:27.319 --> 26:28.821
Could eat this all day.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.354
In the "life doesn't suck"
department,

27:02.388 --> 27:04.123
this is way up there,

27:04.156 --> 27:08.695
a means of conveyance
I find quite comfortable.

27:12.198 --> 27:15.634
Barefoot and a bit drunk,
pleasantly burned by the sun,

27:15.668 --> 27:18.004
lunch approaches.

27:22.842 --> 27:25.044
If you need any prep done,
any knife work,

27:25.077 --> 27:26.345
just let me know.

27:26.378 --> 27:27.980
Got to put some avocado
in there.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.849
- Got to have it.
- Yeah.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.221
First time using a knife?

27:35.254 --> 27:36.856
Well, it's been a while.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.194
You got talent.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.730
Yeah, if this TV thing
falls through,

27:43.763 --> 27:45.331
I can always work at Denny's.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.169
Man, looking great.

27:50.202 --> 27:52.338
All these dishes are
traditional Holy Friday food.

27:52.371 --> 27:56.242
This one is salted cod
marinated in coconut milk.

27:56.275 --> 28:00.546
And then we seared it
with some root vegetables.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.749
And boiled eggs
from our farmers.

28:02.782 --> 28:03.776
Here we have the...
Escabeche.

28:03.783 --> 28:05.351
Escabeche, yeah.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.879
So, like, five fish
marinated or pickled.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.421
It's fried local mackerel,

28:09.455 --> 28:10.716
and then I roast
all the vegetable

28:10.723 --> 28:12.424
and cure it for at least a week.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.861
Oh, the salt dish is good.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.096
Coconut milk really takes
that salty...

28:17.129 --> 28:18.497
Mm-hmm.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.999
Damn, who made
that avocado salad?

28:20.032 --> 28:21.533
It's awesome.
No, the chef is awesome.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.736
Eh, I don't know.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.891
Vieques is officially within

28:44.924 --> 28:47.726
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,

28:47.760 --> 28:51.764
the main island
a mere eight miles away.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.466
It is phenomenally peaceful
here,

28:54.500 --> 28:57.970
but it hasn't always been
that way.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.074
For over 60 years,

29:02.108 --> 29:04.043
the island was used
as a bombing range

29:04.076 --> 29:07.246
for the U.S. Navy
and for training exercises.

29:07.279 --> 29:10.416
The soil is rich
with depleted uranium,

29:10.449 --> 29:13.085
Agent Orange, and the kind of
good stuff left over

29:13.119 --> 29:16.088
after 60 years of explosives
raining down on it.

29:16.122 --> 29:19.458
Many see a clear connection
between that recent history

29:19.491 --> 29:21.928
and a cancer rate
that is 30% higher

29:21.961 --> 29:24.096
than the rest of Puerto Rico.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.565
While the navy works
to clean up what it left,

29:26.598 --> 29:29.435
Vieques tries to deal
with the financial crisis

29:29.468 --> 29:31.804
in its own ways.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.308
Chef Erica Boulogne grew up here

29:36.342 --> 29:38.610
and has raised her family here.

29:41.647 --> 29:43.449
♪

29:43.482 --> 29:45.952
She invited me
to a meal in her home.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.287
Joining us are her mother
and son, Carlitos,

29:48.320 --> 29:52.191
her two nieces,
and her best friend, Elda.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.626
Now, where was
the bombing range?

29:54.660 --> 29:56.028
Pretty close here.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.630
Two miles after this,
maybe less.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.132
This was part of the navy land.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.801
When did the navy stop
using Vieques

30:02.835 --> 30:03.870
as a bombing range?

30:03.903 --> 30:05.171
- 2003.
- 2003.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.306
Oh, that's not that long ago.

30:07.339 --> 30:10.009
So you'd be eating lunch,
and you'd hear, "Boom, boom"?

30:10.042 --> 30:11.343
- Basically.
- Yes.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.611
Yeah, sometimes.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.980
And still they detonate bombs.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.982
This is leftover ordnance.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.017
Yeah, this is, like,
the cleanup process.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.286
They gather
the unexploded munitions,

30:20.319 --> 30:22.121
and then they detonate them
all together.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.123
And the house move
with the bombing.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.125
It's like the middle of the war.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.060
Adam, so you've lived here
for how long?

30:28.094 --> 30:29.361
- All my life.
- Me too.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.997
All my life in Vieques.

30:31.030 --> 30:34.500
I've been drinking
a fair amount of this lately.

30:35.701 --> 30:36.835
This one is flavored with...

30:36.869 --> 30:38.504
- Acerola.
- Acerola.

30:38.537 --> 30:39.872
All right, who's joining me?

30:39.906 --> 30:41.573
Adults only.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.675
- Salut.
- Salut.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.511
Mmm, good.

30:45.544 --> 30:47.880
I'm not driving after this.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.483
Lobsters

30:51.517 --> 30:55.421
with mashed yautia
and yuca from the garden,

30:55.454 --> 30:58.057
conch salad, and coconut arepa.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.992
It's really beautiful here.

31:00.026 --> 31:04.263
This is not San Juan;
this is much more lush and...

31:04.296 --> 31:07.033
- Light, no fast food.
- Born and raised in paradise.

31:07.066 --> 31:10.036
Beautiful beaches,
awesome sunsets.

31:10.069 --> 31:12.171
The whole world wants
what you have already.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.739
How's the economy here?

31:15.041 --> 31:17.076
Bankruptcy.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.111
We are like the colony
of a colony.

31:19.145 --> 31:22.214
Basically, the biggest employer
is the municipal government.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.382
Wait a minute.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.584
The number one employer
on Vieques

31:25.617 --> 31:26.852
is the government.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.220
Yes, the municipal government.

31:28.254 --> 31:29.455
- The local government.
- Yeah.

31:29.488 --> 31:30.889
We also have this dynamic

31:30.923 --> 31:33.859
that people that study
and make a profession,

31:33.892 --> 31:36.695
10% come back,
and that's a high number.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.264
There's no jobs for them.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.732
So our population
is getting older,

31:40.766 --> 31:42.568
and it's formed
by retired people.

31:42.601 --> 31:43.802
Right.
Where they going?

31:43.835 --> 31:46.272
Main island or United States.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.774
What's the plan
when you guys grow up?

31:48.807 --> 31:49.775
What do you want to do?

31:49.808 --> 31:51.110
I want to be a chef.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.311
A chef?

31:52.344 --> 31:55.281
Good for you.
That's hard.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.416
Your dream restaurant,
where would it be?

31:57.449 --> 31:59.385
- The main island.
- You see?

32:00.486 --> 32:03.589
Yeah, so in 20 years...

32:03.622 --> 32:04.923
It's scary.

32:04.957 --> 32:06.492
Who's gonna live...

32:06.525 --> 32:08.727
- Not our kids.
- Who will own Vieques?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.162
I mean, who will be in charge?

32:10.196 --> 32:13.099
Not locals.
Not people that studied here.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.601
The land is too expensive
for the local people.

32:15.634 --> 32:19.605
So this'll be vacation homes
for wealthy people

32:19.638 --> 32:20.906
from other countries.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.341
- Yeah, yeah.
- Basically.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.776
- Yeah.
- Who will save Puerto Rico?

32:24.810 --> 32:26.278
Who will save Vieques?

32:26.312 --> 32:27.846
It ain't gonna be
Big Daddy America.

32:27.879 --> 32:30.116
- It's ourselves.
- But how?

32:30.149 --> 32:31.617
How?
I don't know.

32:31.650 --> 32:32.985
I don't know how.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.040
Life on Vieques offers
the kind of freedom,

32:54.073 --> 32:55.841
the kind of beautiful views

32:55.874 --> 32:59.145
that have largely disappeared
in the developed world.

32:59.178 --> 33:02.781
But life can be difficult.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.617
There is little agriculture
or economy

33:05.651 --> 33:07.653
to sustain the people
who live here.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.393
At one of the highest spots
in Vieques,

33:14.426 --> 33:17.463
the sea visible in the distance,

33:17.496 --> 33:21.667
is Finca Conciencia,
a small but sustainable farm

33:21.700 --> 33:23.869
founded by Jorge Cora Peña,

33:23.902 --> 33:26.372
intent on providing locals
and area restaurants

33:26.405 --> 33:30.909
with fruits, vegetables,
honey, and medicinal herbs.

33:35.181 --> 33:40.486
My name
is Ana Elisa Pérez Quintero.

33:40.519 --> 33:44.022
I live and work
in La Finca Conciencia.

33:44.056 --> 33:47.659
We run a productive
and educational

33:47.693 --> 33:49.828
agricultural project.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.430
We farm.

33:51.463 --> 33:54.200
We have the land
and the resources

33:54.233 --> 33:57.836
to produce food that is
economically viable,

33:57.869 --> 34:02.541
that is self-sustaining
without a lot of investment.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.376
It's liberating.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.058
Jorge cooks lunch.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.536
Mero, or grouper,

34:31.570 --> 34:34.606
stuffed with lobster
and white eggplant...

34:36.942 --> 34:41.580
Wrapped in banana leaves
and grilled over mesquite.

34:41.612 --> 34:45.751
Mangu is mashed plantains
with sofrito.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.556
All right.
That looks good.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.759
And what's this here?
And that's pitorro.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.754
Oh, I know what that is.
I'll have a shot of that.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.397
Actually, we call it
"lágrima de monte,"

34:58.430 --> 35:00.432
like, "teardrop
of the mountain."

35:00.466 --> 35:02.268
Will I be crying afterwards?

35:02.301 --> 35:03.269
Maybe.

35:03.302 --> 35:05.070
It's very intense.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.772
- Salut.
- Salut.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.010
How long have you had this farm?

35:12.043 --> 35:13.579
How long have you been
doing this?

35:13.612 --> 35:16.748
Jorge started the farm
around ten years now,

35:16.782 --> 35:19.685
but the farm was originally
part of the area

35:19.718 --> 35:20.852
that the navy took.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.321
Oh, yeah.

35:22.354 --> 35:23.948
And so it's part
of the rescues that happened

35:23.955 --> 35:26.292
throughout the '80s, '90s.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.093
Farming is difficult work.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.495
- Yeah.
- So why?

35:29.528 --> 35:31.330
My mom would ask
the same question.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.098
She was like,
"What are you doing?

35:33.131 --> 35:35.301
Are you quitting your job
that"...

35:35.334 --> 35:37.869
In Puerto Rico, it's really hard
to find a good job.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.972
But I think that farming
is the most practical thing

35:41.006 --> 35:44.510
that we can do
in the midst of a crisis.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.004
It is something
that is gonna create work.

35:46.011 --> 35:47.646
It's gonna help the economy.

35:47.679 --> 35:48.980
It's a blunt question,

35:49.014 --> 35:50.982
but can you make money farming?

35:51.016 --> 35:52.618
In Puerto Rico,
it's still a challenge,

35:52.651 --> 35:54.286
because, obviously,
we get a lot of food

35:54.320 --> 35:56.722
that's super subsidized
from the U.S.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.690
But there are people
who are our neighbors

35:58.724 --> 36:00.659
are like, "I'll pay more."

36:00.692 --> 36:02.328
Like, how much is it worth,
you know?

36:02.361 --> 36:03.829
People really value the work

36:03.862 --> 36:05.997
when they see
that we're working for it.

36:06.031 --> 36:07.165
It's part of a statement.

36:07.199 --> 36:08.834
It's part of educating people.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.737
Since our generation,
supermarket, supermarket.

36:11.770 --> 36:15.307
We were consciously stripped
away from farming.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.175
People were forced
out of the country

36:17.209 --> 36:18.644
to be able to work

36:18.677 --> 36:20.712
in all of these maquiladoras
and everything.

36:20.746 --> 36:24.082
Kids here were
completely disconnected from...

36:24.115 --> 36:27.052
And my generation...
From where things grow.

36:27.085 --> 36:29.488
Like, we do an exercise
with local schools,

36:29.521 --> 36:33.259
and kids here draw a plantain
growing like a lettuce.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.427
I mean, the last thing
in the world the States wants

36:35.461 --> 36:37.829
is for Puerto Rico to become
sustainable,

36:37.863 --> 36:40.232
because it means you're gonna
buy less stuff.

36:40.266 --> 36:42.434
Less snacks, less Pepsi,

36:42.468 --> 36:43.702
less American products.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.036
We don't like that.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.072
If we don't have
our own food supply,

36:47.105 --> 36:49.608
we can't even think about
really being able

36:49.641 --> 36:51.042
to govern ourselves.

36:51.076 --> 36:52.711
Really, if we can
feed ourselves,

36:52.744 --> 36:54.179
we can free ourselves.
