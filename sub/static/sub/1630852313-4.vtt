00:08.400 --> 00:10.960
Previously on
"Queens of Mystery"...

00:10.960 --> 00:13.680
This is a private
viewing, Fintan.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.840
My deal with Cox means
that work by my best students

00:16.840 --> 00:18.840
will be exhibited
for my lifetime.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.080
This is state censorship.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.200
- Oh!
- I want Kane in chains.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.280
Would you go out
to dinner with me?

00:26.280 --> 00:28.480
10 grand. Cash.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.200
You seem to have developed
quite the knack

00:30.200 --> 00:32.000
for unconering
lost masterpieces.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.200
He knows.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.600
I'll deal with him.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.800
Fintan! You're going cuckoo!

00:41.960 --> 00:43.640
She's definitely
up to something.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.640
Before our young lives end.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.400
It's an acronym.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.760
That's Fintan Boyle's
skull she's smashing.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.360
An extraordinary new work
by Keith Kane.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.680
So, what do you all think?

01:03.400 --> 01:05.200
Robert Cox has just
sped off in his sport car,

01:05.200 --> 01:07.960
and Cat's gone
haring after him.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.280
Did Cox get away,
or was he taken?

01:14.920 --> 01:16.840
Don't look now, but I think
someone over there

01:16.840 --> 01:18.960
is watching the gallery.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.360
Stone.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.680
I've found Robert Cox, sir.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.640
What's his condition?

03:41.640 --> 03:44.560
To be honest,
he's looked better.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.720
The murdered
art collector and sometime

03:54.720 --> 03:59.200
getaway driver Robert Cox had
the raw, unsettling look

03:59.200 --> 04:01.160
of a Francis Bacon.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.360
An artist he'd coincidentally

04:04.360 --> 04:07.840
once bought
a near perfect fake of.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.400
Blunt force trauma to the head.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.200
Looks like he was
bludgeoned to death.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.720
What about the cash?

04:15.240 --> 04:16.440
Ah, it's just for show.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.400
A nod to the heist, perhaps.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.240
There's no visible blood
splatter surrounding the body,

04:20.240 --> 04:22.480
so I suspect he was positioned
here sometime after death.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.920
Lab report's back
on Fintan Boyle.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.280
Okay, that's unexpected.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.760
What is?

04:32.760 --> 04:35.080
Toxicology report says
high levels of LSD.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.760
Fintan Boyle was tripping
when he was murdered?

04:36.760 --> 04:38.400
It appears so.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.400
When I first spoke to Boyle,
he was complaining

04:40.400 --> 04:42.000
about a taste of a drink
he'd be given by Yetao.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.080
- You think it was spiked?
- Maybe.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.600
Beth and Jane saw her get rid
of something in the river.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.840
And her video art is of her
smashing a fake version

04:48.840 --> 04:51.080
of Boyle's skull
with a sledge hammer.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.640
Foster, find this Yetao woman

04:52.640 --> 04:53.520
and bring her in
for questioning.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.880
Yes sir.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.520
Carry on, Sergeant.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.680
Any progress
on Fintan Boyle's will?

05:00.680 --> 05:02.480
We're waiting for a solicitor
to send us a copy.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.160
I'll chase it.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.640
We need to find out if he'd
written Vanessa Mills

05:05.640 --> 05:08.080
out of it already
or if she's still a beneficiary.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.600
After all, Cox and Boyle were
short changing her

05:10.600 --> 05:12.760
in the divorce,
and now both men are dead.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.000
I'd better head her off before
she contaminates the scene.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.200
Let me know when you've
got Yetao at the station.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.560
Please don't come any closer.

05:24.480 --> 05:28.560
What were your movements last
night from 6:00 p.m. onwards?

05:28.560 --> 05:31.920
I locked up at 7:00.
Keith came back here. We ate.

05:31.920 --> 05:36.080
I dropped him off at the pub
around 11:00.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.760
Tell me about your relationship
with Keith Kane.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.560
Our relationship?

05:42.560 --> 05:45.600
Keith and I have been great
friends for over 20 years.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.080
But it's never been physical,
if that's what you mean.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.200
Were you aware that your ex
and Robert Cox

05:54.200 --> 05:56.280
had agreed a side deal?

05:56.280 --> 05:58.280
For the Boyle collection?

05:58.280 --> 05:59.360
I knew it.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.200
Scheming thieving scumbags.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.200
God rest their souls.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.200
How much?

06:15.200 --> 06:18.200
Mr Cox paid an additional
2 million

06:18.200 --> 06:20.960
into Mr. Boyle's
Swiss bank account.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.880
So much for legacy and art.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.720
I thought you might need a cup.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.840
So, are we all in grave danger?

06:38.840 --> 06:40.200
From now on, there'll be
a police presense

06:40.200 --> 06:41.720
at Egde and the pub.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.200
You'll be safe.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.680
Good to know.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.360
Where were you last night?

06:47.360 --> 06:49.840
Here with Kane until about 7:00.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.840
Then I had dinner
back at the pub.

06:51.840 --> 06:56.520
- Anyone verify that?
- Yetao. We ate together.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.680
Then I went up to my room
at closing time.

06:59.680 --> 07:00.960
Alone?

07:00.960 --> 07:03.400
Mm-hmm.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.000
I may still need to bring you in
for further questioning.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.200
Mmm, excellent tea.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.800
Should be.
The boss is a big drinker.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.200
Assam, Darjeeling.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.920
It's a bit of a problem.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.880
Where is Mr. Kane?

07:21.880 --> 07:23.920
- Haven't seen him yet.
- Is that normal?

07:23.920 --> 07:26.200
Oh, sure, yeah.
He's a night owl.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.080
- Hmm.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.200
- Thanks for the brew.
- Oh.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.200
- Duty calls.
- Hmm.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.200
Finton Boyle had LSD in his
system when he died.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.360
But you knew that because
you spiked his drink

07:46.360 --> 07:48.240
and was seen disposing
of evidence.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.840
Seen by who?

07:49.840 --> 07:51.520
So you admit to drugging him?

07:51.520 --> 07:55.200
I'm not admitting anything.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.400
Spiking someone's drink
with a class A drug is

07:57.400 --> 08:00.200
punishable by up to
13 years in prison.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.080
So you'd better start
cooperating with me.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.560
If I have done something
like that,

08:13.560 --> 08:16.840
it might been to make him
look a fool at a big event

08:16.840 --> 08:20.680
for leaving me out
of his collection.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.440
Did being left out
make you angry?

08:22.440 --> 08:24.240
Sure.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.240
But you know,
not enough to kill him.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.840
Did you clash
with Robert Cox?

08:37.840 --> 08:40.920
Never.
We barely knew each other.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.880
So, unlike with Fintan Boyle,

08:42.880 --> 08:46.880
there's no video art of you
doing anything violent to him?

08:46.880 --> 08:47.960
No.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.400
And that was a joke.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.920
To get back at Fintan
for being a bully.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.200
How did you know you weren't
part of the Boyle collection?

08:57.200 --> 08:59.880
Did he tell you?

08:59.880 --> 09:02.360
I nicked his catalogue.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.960
Do you still have it?

09:05.760 --> 09:08.000
Not exactly.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.680
So, who would Robert Cox dead?

09:16.680 --> 09:18.040
Our mystery lady?

09:18.040 --> 09:20.200
- She needs a name.
- Jane Doe.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.080
- Does it have to be Jane?
- I don't make the rules.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.400
The trouble is, Jane Doe could
be half way to Timbuktu by now.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.880
So, we let the police worry
about her for the time being.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.360
Who's next?

09:30.360 --> 09:34.240
Yetao. She's been acting
very suspiciously.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.280
But I never noticed any
animosity between her and Cox.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.800
Did you?

09:39.800 --> 09:41.440
Una Lowe.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.840
After you sped off
in hot pursuit of Robert Cox,

09:43.840 --> 09:47.400
she came up to us
and was being a bit weird.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.960
She seemed to know something.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.200
Uh, Matilda?

10:08.200 --> 10:09.920
Hi.

10:09.920 --> 10:13.440
Uh, you've got...in your hair.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.680
Oh.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.200
Uh, here.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.440
As Daniel gently
picked rubbish

10:22.440 --> 10:25.400
from Matilda's hair,
he couldn't help but wonder

10:25.400 --> 10:27.920
if he wasn't making
a mess of his life.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.840
Um, I was just following up
on a clue.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.240
So, I'm done examining
the scene.

10:37.240 --> 10:40.200
I found fragments of moss
and wood in the wounds

10:40.200 --> 10:41.960
on the back
of Robert Cox's head.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.680
- From the murder weapon?
- Possibly.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.080
Looks like he was hit
with a heavy branch or a log.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.920
Something the killer
picked up off the ground?

10:47.920 --> 10:49.400
Seems likely.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.480
I put time of death
between 6:00 and midnight

10:51.480 --> 10:52.880
and then the body was moved
to the gallery

10:52.880 --> 10:54.640
some hours after that.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.520
Natasha --

10:59.520 --> 11:00.760
Hi.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.360
Are you still at the gallery?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.080
I am, but I'm nearly done.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.200
You'll get to the gym
this afternoon, then?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.760
That's my plan.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.840
You mean our plan.

11:09.840 --> 11:13.920
I went before surgery.
Shame my patient didn't.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.880
Oops. Got to go.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.440
Kiss, kiss.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.080
- Hmm.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.920
Okay, then.

11:28.920 --> 11:29.960
Good luck in there.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.720
Thanks.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.680
Right.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.840
That's not recyclable.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.360
- Stone.
- Sir?

12:32.360 --> 12:34.640
The mastermind
behind the Bawling's heist.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.240
What about them?

12:38.240 --> 12:41.720
She was a woman, Stone.

12:41.720 --> 12:46.160
Great art gives meaning
to a world devoid of certainty.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.000
The Lowe Down Gallery
gives context to that art.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.200
It says here Una Lowe owns only
20% of the shares

13:00.200 --> 13:02.080
in her gallery.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.600
The business records show
the rest

13:03.600 --> 13:06.600
belongs to
Anderson Arts International,

13:06.600 --> 13:11.680
which has registered its address
as a PO Box in Panama.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.600
No, there's no website
for it either.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.440
A shell company.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.400
I'll install some optical
character recognition software,

13:21.400 --> 13:23.920
then scan the database of leaked
offshore company papers,

13:23.920 --> 13:25.960
and see if the name turns up.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.240
I was going to suggest that.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.800
Same.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.360
Have a look at the mug shots.
Is it her?

13:35.360 --> 13:37.520
It is different.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.480
She's aged a lot since then.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.400
10 years in maximum security
will do that to you.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.000
Yes.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.080
That's the woman who was
at the gallery, sir.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.680
According to this report,
the getaway driver,

13:47.680 --> 13:49.760
who we know now to be
Robert Cox,

13:49.760 --> 13:52.160
who went by the alias
Aussie Barry,

13:52.160 --> 13:54.160
was the only member of the gang
who wasn't caught

13:54.160 --> 13:57.120
after an anonymous tip off
to the police.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.320
Blew the whistle on the others
and kept the cash for himself.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.600
Guess he missed the memo
about honor among thieves.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.080
And now Tanya here
has got her revenge.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.080
Look what I found, sir.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.680
Oh, here we go.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.520
The shell company was set up
by Mr. Barry Anderson

14:19.520 --> 14:22.400
whose contact address
is in Sydney.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.680
Another Australian.

14:24.680 --> 14:28.000
I'm thinking Barry Anderson and
Robert Cox are one and the same.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.400
I doubt it's a coincidence.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.480
I mean, secretly owning
a posh London art gallery

14:33.480 --> 14:36.720
is a great place to launder
a serious amount of cash.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.160
And having someone respectable

14:38.160 --> 14:40.720
like Una Lowe
fronting it makes sense.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.200
And no wonder she was so nervous

14:42.200 --> 14:45.760
when he was wanted
by the police.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.760
Where are you going?

14:46.760 --> 14:49.680
To tell Matilda.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.720
Look at the signature.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.400
Krasner.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.200
Surely no one would destroy
an original.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.400
This has to be a fake.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.480
Contact the Art and Antiques
Unit and find out.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.120
- Unh-unh.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.360
Oh,
for goodness' sake.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.080
What exactly
is going on here?

15:17.080 --> 15:18.400
I told her she needed to wait.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.240
And I told him I have
important information

15:20.240 --> 15:22.120
regarding the investigation.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.440
So, Jane did her, you know,
techie thing and discovered

15:33.440 --> 15:36.520
that Una's gallery is owned by
some shady businessman from

15:36.520 --> 15:38.400
down under called
Barry Anderson,

15:38.400 --> 15:41.280
which we suspect is an alias
used by Robert Cox.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.600
Aussie Barry.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.600
We think Cox has been
laundering money

15:44.600 --> 15:46.840
from the heist
through the gallery.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.840
The forged Krasner.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.360
I found what looked like
a Krasner

15:50.360 --> 15:52.200
cut up in the bin behind Egde.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.960
I've just had confirmation
it's a fake.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.480
Una gave me this.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.960
She said she'd uncovered
some long lost

15:58.960 --> 16:00.920
abstract expressionist pieces.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.640
Now, Krasner was one of
the leading artists

16:03.640 --> 16:05.360
of that movement.

16:05.360 --> 16:10.360
Okay, so Cox knowingly
buys fakes from Una,

16:10.360 --> 16:12.480
pays as if they're
the real thing,

16:12.480 --> 16:14.400
then takes the clean cash out

16:14.400 --> 16:16.200
through his share
of the gallery profits.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.040
Ker-ching.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.200
I need to speak to Una.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.600
Terry?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.960
You're in charge of
tracking down Tanya Shaw.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.440
I'm all over it.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.160
This was absolutely
the sort of

16:26.160 --> 16:28.840
big city policing
PC Foster dreamed of.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.680
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.560
Inspector Thorne will
have me on desk duty

16:32.560 --> 16:34.240
if he finds out
you've been helping me again.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.920
Okay. What's the matter?

16:38.920 --> 16:41.800
And the truth this time, please.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.720
I invited Annie to the opening
of the gallery,

16:44.720 --> 16:47.720
and she didn't show.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.040
Oh, I'm sorry, Aunt Cat.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.680
You can hardly blame her.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.440
I've been a lousy mother.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.880
Not to me, you weren't.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.440
Well, I had some help, kid.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.680
Catching up on some work?

17:19.680 --> 17:21.360
The Lowe Down Gallery
doesn't run itself.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.760
Or fund itself.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.800
Was it difficult finding someone
willing to bankroll you?

17:26.800 --> 17:28.520
I managed.

17:28.520 --> 17:31.400
I've made good contacts working
in the London art world.

17:31.400 --> 17:35.000
You mean like your gallery's
actual owner, Barry Anderson?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.120
Or should I say Robert Cox?

17:37.120 --> 17:39.520
I was
going to tell you.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.760
Honest.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.640
What?

17:42.640 --> 17:45.360
How you're involved in money
laundering and forgeries?

17:49.400 --> 17:54.360
Oh, and by the way, I found the
Krasner you tried to get rid of.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.360
It's basically impossible
for someone like me

18:00.360 --> 18:02.680
to break into this industry.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.680
Grafted my whole life.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.560
No silver spoon.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.120
Cox offered me my dream
when no one else would.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.080
The rest of the gallery's
above board.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.200
The fakes, just for him,
once in a while.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.200
Where's the harm in that?

18:15.200 --> 18:16.880
The harm?

18:16.880 --> 18:19.360
You helped a bank robber wash
millions in stolen cash.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.720
I didn't know how he got
his money.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.240
You've had to be naive
or negligent

18:22.240 --> 18:23.680
not to suspect it was dirty,

18:23.680 --> 18:26.600
and I'm pretty sure
you're neither, Una.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.360
He seemed legit to start with.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.000
Then things changed.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.600
If I'd have told your lot,
I'd have lost everything.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.040
Must be a relief he's dead then.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.280
I never said that.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.400
Well, right now,
the Arts and Antiques Unit

18:39.400 --> 18:41.000
are raiding your gallery,
and your assets

18:41.000 --> 18:43.080
have been frozen
while they investigate.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.840
Being mixed up in
money laundering

18:44.840 --> 18:47.200
and forged art is serious.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.960
Yes!

19:06.000 --> 19:09.480
Okay, so if
you had to guess,

19:09.480 --> 19:12.440
who do you currently think
the killer is?

19:12.440 --> 19:15.640
"Guessing,"
as Sherlock Holmes said,

19:15.640 --> 19:17.120
"is a shocking habit,

19:17.120 --> 19:19.440
destructive to
the logical faculty."

19:22.680 --> 19:23.880
No, I'm not doing it.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.240
Oh, come on, live a little.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.400
- Oh, that might be a customer.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.000
You're in charge
of the Venn diagram.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.720
Do I have to be?

19:31.720 --> 19:34.600
You know me and maths
don't exactly see eye to eye.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.080
Hello. Are you...

19:47.080 --> 19:49.480
looking for anything
in particular?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.640
Revenge.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.280
Oh.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.600
But they took that away from me.

20:10.440 --> 20:11.520
What's wrong?

20:11.520 --> 20:13.040
I still can't get a hold
of Keith.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.240
He probably just forgot
to set an alarm.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.520
I'll head over to the hotel.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.440
I'll come with you.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.840
What, do you think
something's happened to him?

20:21.840 --> 20:23.760
No, but best we check.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.520
I'll drive.

20:27.640 --> 20:31.560
You never mentioned you were on
Boyle's course at Pennysmiths.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.240
Uh, it was just for a year.
Uh, I dropped out.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.200
- I couldn't afford the fees.
- Shame.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.600
I really liked
your self portrait

20:37.600 --> 20:40.280
in the Boyle Collection
catalogue.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.960
Thanks.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.360
I only found out yesterday.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.920
I was surprised to be included.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.600
Do you still paint?

20:47.600 --> 20:50.760
Funnily enough, I'm thinking
of getting back to it.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.600
Terry?

20:55.600 --> 20:58.440
Okay, so the good news is
I've found Tanya Shaw.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.000
You have? Where?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.400
Well, that's the bad news.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.920
She's currently at Murder Ink,
talking to your Aunt Jane.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.360
Can you check on Kane yourself?

21:13.120 --> 21:14.520
Murder Ink. How can I help you?

21:14.520 --> 21:15.840
Aunt Beth, it's me.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.520
- Hey, Mattie.
- Where's Jane?

21:17.520 --> 21:18.960
With a customer.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.480
That's not a customer,
that's Tanya Shaw,

21:20.480 --> 21:23.760
the ex con who masterminded
the Bawling's Bank heist.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.920
Whilst Beth stone was
against criminals in general,

21:26.920 --> 21:31.000
she was very much in favor of
women smashing glass ceilings.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.480
So Tanya Shaw's
noteworthy contribution

21:33.480 --> 21:36.880
to an area so dominated by men
impressed her.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.280
I'll go check.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.200
Aunt Beth?

21:42.200 --> 21:43.680
Beth!

22:08.960 --> 22:10.240
They still inside?

22:10.240 --> 22:12.360
- Yeah.
- Okay, guard the door.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.160
This one is very escapist.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.600
Ah, Mattie, I was about
to call you back.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.240
I just made Tanya a cup of tea.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.480
Thank you.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.680
Cheers, Leroy.

23:04.440 --> 23:07.600
Excuse me, it's Cat, right?
Detective Sergeant Stone's aunt?

23:07.600 --> 23:09.920
Hm, yeah, among other things.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.200
You haven't seen Keith Kane,
have you?

23:12.200 --> 23:14.840
- Nope.
- Okay.

23:14.840 --> 23:18.880
Uh, could you pass a message
on to your niece for me?

23:18.880 --> 23:20.440
It might be important.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.120
Yeah, go on then.

23:22.120 --> 23:23.480
Tell her Kane is not
in his room.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.280
And it doesn't look like
he slept there last night.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.840
Okay.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.680
Keith Kane's gone missing again?

23:41.680 --> 23:46.600
So this disappearance makes him
a suspect or a potential victim?

23:46.600 --> 23:49.440
Kane will out live us all.
Guaranteed it.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.200
And don't forget his
"Am I art?" graffiti tag.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.080
That's a bit
self incriminating.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.600
Or it's
a clever double bluff.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.680
Well, I know a way to find out.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.240
Oh, I've got a lead
on that vehicle

24:02.240 --> 24:05.120
that rammed into Terry
and Robert Cox.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.360
Right.

24:08.360 --> 24:11.720
Chromatography.

24:11.720 --> 24:15.000
Tanya, we know you came to
Wildemarsh looking for this man.

24:21.200 --> 24:24.000
Life's hilarious, isn't it?

24:24.000 --> 24:27.800
I wanted to kill him
for such a long time.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.280
But someone got to him first.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.640
His mouth was stuffed with cash.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.400
Are you really telling me
that isn't

24:41.400 --> 24:42.960
because he turned you in
for the Balling's Bank heist?

24:42.960 --> 24:44.920
I didn't kill him.

24:44.920 --> 24:50.600
I found him in that sculpture
garden at 3:00 in the morning.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.800
What were you doing there
at that hour?

24:53.800 --> 24:56.360
I was gonna break in.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.840
Look for a record
of his address in the office.

25:00.960 --> 25:05.440
He stole 10 years off me.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.880
And I was that close.

25:09.880 --> 25:15.600
So I stuffed his grassing
gob full of cash,

25:15.600 --> 25:18.040
trying to make myself
feel better.

25:20.360 --> 25:23.600
Why go to my aunt's bookshop?

25:23.600 --> 25:26.040
It was books what kept me
alive in prison.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.080
I needed something to read.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.640
Mm.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.280
Oh.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.200
Oh, hi.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.120
Hi. Hi. Hi, Beth.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.160
Jane.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.200
The paint samples that were
taking from

26:04.200 --> 26:06.360
the "Am I Art?" graffiti?

26:06.360 --> 26:07.920
I'm still waiting for
the results on those.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.360
Major backlog at the lab.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.200
Do you send off
the whole sample?

26:11.200 --> 26:13.040
No, I always keep some in case
they get mislaid

26:13.040 --> 26:14.240
at the other end.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.120
Solvent please.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.680
Do you buy all that "Someone
got to him first" stuff

26:42.680 --> 26:43.800
she just came out with?

26:43.800 --> 26:45.600
Terry checked her car.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.840
No sign of impact, so she
didn't ram him off the road.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.440
And the gun's a replica,
like she said.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.680
Well, we can't charge her
for wanting to kill someone,

26:53.680 --> 26:55.200
otherwise we'd
all be banged up.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.200
Boyle's solicitor
got back to me.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.600
Vanessa Mills is still
in his will.

27:01.600 --> 27:02.520
What was she left?

27:02.520 --> 27:05.520
Matisse, Rothko and Picasso.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.040
Now, that is a motive
for murder.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.280
Keith Kane.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.840
- Mattie.
- Cat.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.760
I found the vehicle that rammed
into Terry.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.520
It belongs to Egde Gallery.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.880
Vanessa Mills.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.360
There was a blood stain
in the back,

28:29.360 --> 28:31.800
and this was behind the seats.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.040
It's Keith Kane's.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.600
Wait there, okay?

29:00.320 --> 29:01.920
I guess you've heard
that my gallery

29:01.920 --> 29:04.200
was really just Cox's laundry?

29:05.680 --> 29:07.560
Well, we all make mistakes.

29:07.560 --> 29:08.920
We're human.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.760
Yeah.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.080
But not only was I selling
fakes, I've been a fake myself.

29:48.920 --> 29:52.080
The paint samples
from Kane's sign,

29:52.080 --> 29:54.840
Boyle's body, and Cox's body.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.280
All three look identical to me.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.880
Therefore, they were mixed using

29:57.880 --> 30:00.600
the exact same
color components.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.880
Ergo, we need to find
Keith Kane.

30:03.880 --> 30:07.600
Which, although
he was hopelessly lost,

30:07.600 --> 30:09.000
- wouldn't prove so difficult.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.400
Don't. My head is splitting.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.320
Keith?

30:17.720 --> 30:21.600
I'm Beth Stone.
This is my sister Jane.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.480
Come on, let's get you
out of the road.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.200
Congratulations.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.600
You're about to become
extremely rich.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.880
Despite divorce proceedings,

30:38.880 --> 30:41.080
Fintan Boyle kept you
in his will.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.920
You get a Matisse,
a Rothko, and a Picasso.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.600
They're Fintan's dogs.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.240
He's having the last laugh.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.680
I'm allergic.

30:55.680 --> 30:58.200
Hmm, I see.

30:58.200 --> 31:01.640
Well, can you explain
why the blood stained van

31:01.640 --> 31:03.600
that rammed my colleague
off the road yesterday

31:03.600 --> 31:05.200
is registered to your gallery?

31:05.200 --> 31:07.240
No. I can't.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.400
But it still has nothing
to do with me.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.840
So, who else has access
to the van?

31:11.840 --> 31:14.280
Keith.
But I mean, he'd never.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.800
He's probably just forgotten
to return the keys.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.200
Bloody Mary?

31:28.200 --> 31:29.880
Bloody hell, no.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.640
Back to square one.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.200
Three years I've been sober.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.720
How did you hurt your hands?

31:42.040 --> 31:45.600
It's all a bit fuzzy.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.360
But I do have this terrible
feeling something

31:47.360 --> 31:50.680
really awful happened
last night.

31:50.680 --> 31:52.240
Like what?

31:55.200 --> 31:58.960
I realize this looks suspicious,
but there is an explanation.

32:02.240 --> 32:05.200
He's not well.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.600
Keith has lived life hard,
too hard,

32:07.600 --> 32:10.840
and now it is
catching up with him.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.880
He's becoming forgetful.

32:12.880 --> 32:16.760
And worse,
his sight is fading fast.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.200
- He's going blind?
- Yes.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.480
Very few people know.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.160
The dark glasses.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.600
Won't be long, bruv.
I reckon I ducking killed it.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.000
I couldn't see.
There were people in the way.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.200
I need to speak to someone

32:34.200 --> 32:35.440
from the admissions department
at Pennysmiths.

32:35.440 --> 32:36.840
Have you got their number?

32:36.840 --> 32:38.520
Yes. What's the matter?

32:38.520 --> 32:40.240
I really hope I'm wrong.

32:45.240 --> 32:48.640
So, how come you still had
hold of the fake Krasner?

32:48.640 --> 32:51.000
Because Cox gave it to me.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.640
But why didn't he just take it
straight to your gallery

32:52.640 --> 32:53.960
in London?

32:53.960 --> 32:55.520
I wondered that.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.840
He was gonna be there
early next week.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.960
And you have no idea
who the forger actually is?

33:07.240 --> 33:09.720
I wonder if someone here
painted it.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.840
I can't see Keith Kane
or Yetao faking art.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.760
Why risk their reputation?

33:15.760 --> 33:19.200
Well, there is one person here
without a reputation to risk.

33:22.040 --> 33:24.880
I just remember what happened.

33:24.880 --> 33:27.240
My assistant came to visit me
late last night in my room,

33:27.240 --> 33:29.400
told me he was quitting.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.200
No wonder I hit the bottle.
That's a disaster.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.040
He does everything for me.
I need him.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.200
Does he mix your paints?

33:39.200 --> 33:41.200
Yeah.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.200
I need to tell Matilda.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.080
- We need to tell Matilda.
- We need to tell Matilda.

34:28.760 --> 34:32.720
The light's rather beautiful
in here, don't you think?

34:46.760 --> 34:49.200
You've come to arrest me?

34:49.200 --> 34:52.120
I wish that wasn't true,
but, yes.

34:54.280 --> 34:57.680
First, I'd like to do
a last sketch.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.280
Of what?

35:03.480 --> 35:06.000
And you'll answer
all my questions?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.800
With searing honesty.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.760
Okay.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.040
I hate to be interrupted
when I work.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.600
Boyle always said
that above all else,

35:38.600 --> 35:40.960
a great artist needs focus.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.040
Stand in the light, please.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.520
What gave me away?

36:01.520 --> 36:02.960
The van.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.520
I know Keith Kane's
losing his eyesight.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.240
He can't see well enough
to drive in the dark,

36:07.240 --> 36:11.960
so couldn't have moved
Robert Cox's body at night.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.240
And of course you had
access to the keys.

36:14.240 --> 36:18.480
Trying to get away with
murder is a lot like making art.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.960
You use whatever materials
are available.

36:20.960 --> 36:24.560
And for you, that was Kane,
his phone, his credit card.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.600
Also you lied to me about
dropping out of Pennysmiths

36:28.600 --> 36:30.720
because of the fees.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.080
I checked the records.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.920
Yeah.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.200
Sorry about that.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.680
- Vanessa?
- Mm-hmm.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.840
- Where's Matilda?
- I don't know.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.000
She was on the phone
to Pennysmiths,

37:04.000 --> 37:05.600
and then she just ran out.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.520
And William Garnet,
have you seen him?

37:07.520 --> 37:09.760
Uh, I think he's
up in his studio.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.720
You need to focus, Garnet.

37:14.720 --> 37:18.400
Focus! Focus! Focus!

37:18.400 --> 37:20.960
His relentless bullying
drove me out.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.840
Pathetic!

37:22.840 --> 37:26.120
Stripped me of any
confidence I had in my talent.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.840
And you
hated him for it.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.600
For not recognizing
your potential.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.840
Actually, no.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.840
For years,
I believed he was right.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.920
That I just wasn't good enough.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.720
So I completely stopped creating
my own stuff

37:39.720 --> 37:41.480
and had Keith pay me peanuts

37:41.480 --> 37:43.240
to do most of the actual
work on his art,

37:43.240 --> 37:46.760
which then sold for a fortune
because his name's on it.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.400
But hey...

37:49.400 --> 37:51.920
That's the art world for you.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.680
It's full of fakes
and forgeries.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.200
Krasner.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.960
You painted it for Cox.

37:57.960 --> 38:01.600
He came to me about a month ago.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.720
Offered me a way
to make some real money.

38:03.720 --> 38:06.200
Guess he'd seen my self portrait
in the Boyle collection

38:06.200 --> 38:08.080
and figured
I had the chops for it.

38:17.440 --> 38:21.240
I saw him in
the sculpture garden.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.840
He as acting weird.

38:26.920 --> 38:29.360
And I suddenly had this
need to confront him.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.680
I just wanted to ask him
why he did it.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.600
And he said this thing to me.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.480
"My greatest disappointment."

38:45.480 --> 38:47.520
Like it was my fault.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.520
And I lost it.

38:54.520 --> 38:55.720
Completely.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.440
Ugh!

39:05.680 --> 39:07.520
Where's Jane when you need her?

39:09.440 --> 39:10.840
There's a road full of llamas.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.000
Well, strictly speaking,
these are alpaca.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.160
You're right,
they're in the way.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.720
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo,
shoo! Go away!

39:23.200 --> 39:25.360
What about Robert Cox?

39:25.360 --> 39:27.080
Called me from the plane.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.760
Said he was about
to be taken into custody.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.520
Told me to do something
about it, or he'd grass me up

39:30.520 --> 39:32.920
for forging art the moment
he got to the station.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.360
But then I realized

39:51.360 --> 39:56.040
that he would hold it
all over me forever.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.960
And he would own me.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.920
I couldn't live like that.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.040
Not again.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.720
I'm done with bullies.

40:20.560 --> 40:24.200
So you hid the body in the van,
went to the pub for an alibi,

40:24.200 --> 40:26.720
stole Keith Kane's phone
to plant and throw us off

40:26.720 --> 40:29.240
the scent,
and repeated your trick with

40:29.240 --> 40:31.360
the "Am I Art?" graffiti?

40:31.360 --> 40:32.720
I figured if Keith looked
guilty enough,

40:32.720 --> 40:34.520
you'd have to let
the rest of us leave.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.040
It wasn't personal.

40:49.640 --> 40:52.600
What the hell are you doing?!

40:52.600 --> 40:53.720
- Hey!
- Mattie?

40:53.720 --> 40:55.520
- I'm talking to you.
- Just --

40:55.520 --> 40:57.080
Oh!

41:24.800 --> 41:26.600
Thanks.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.240
What for?

41:28.240 --> 41:30.680
For letting me draw you.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.520
William Garnet,
I'm arresting you

41:35.520 --> 41:38.200
for the murders
of Fintan Boyle and Robert Cox.

42:04.200 --> 42:05.680
You okay, kid?

42:13.240 --> 42:17.080
So, what's gonna happen to Una?

42:17.080 --> 42:18.600
As Cox knew
he was buying fakes,

42:18.600 --> 42:21.240
she can't be prosecuted
for fraud.

42:21.240 --> 42:23.880
And without proof she knew
he was laundering stolen money,

42:23.880 --> 42:26.040
I doubt any charges
will be brought against her.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.760
And Yetao?

42:27.760 --> 42:29.480
The evidence
that she spiked Boyle's drink

42:29.480 --> 42:30.840
is circumstantial.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.040
She'll just get
a slap on the wrist.

42:37.440 --> 42:38.640
Cheers for clearing my name.

42:38.640 --> 42:39.880
You're welcome.

42:39.880 --> 42:41.440
Nicest part of the job.

42:45.960 --> 42:48.520
Keith's gonna be staying down
here with me for a while,

42:48.520 --> 42:50.200
till he gets back on track.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.040
Be like old times.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.760
By the way, Keith...

42:59.440 --> 43:00.760
He's good.

43:00.760 --> 43:02.200
He was.

43:02.200 --> 43:05.960
All that talent,
such a waste.

43:05.960 --> 43:08.240
He's really captured you,
Mattie.

43:08.240 --> 43:10.520
I think it looks more like Mum.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.760
Yep.

43:44.760 --> 43:46.360
Cat, it's Vanessa Mills.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.360
- You all right?
- I am.

43:48.360 --> 43:50.280
So, obviously,
the gallery opening

43:50.280 --> 43:52.240
didn't quite go
according to plan,

43:52.240 --> 43:55.200
but our website traffic
has soared.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.680
Oh. Good.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.920
So I put up some photos of work
from the show,

43:58.920 --> 44:02.640
and I have a buyer
for one of your pieces.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.520
Annie Stone.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.480
Any relation?

44:06.480 --> 44:09.880
Uh, yeah.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she is.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.600
Yeah, thanks, Vanessa.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.040
You're welcome.

44:21.600 --> 44:25.240
Cat embraced this as
a sign she and her

44:25.240 --> 44:29.840
estranged daughter might one day
reopen their relationship.

44:29.840 --> 44:33.440
But Matilda was about
to discover a "sold" sign

44:33.440 --> 44:36.120
that would close
a promising line of inquiry

44:36.120 --> 44:39.960
into her mother's
mysterious disappearance.

44:39.960 --> 44:43.240
Almost as quickly
as it had appeared.

45:25.680 --> 45:28.560
Oh! George.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.040
You're back.

45:30.040 --> 45:31.400
Just landed.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.160
Wondered when I might see you,

45:33.160 --> 45:34.800
and I looked up,
and there you were.

45:35.840 --> 45:38.640
Sorry, are you on a case?

45:38.640 --> 45:41.640
In that moment,
Matilda realized she had

45:41.640 --> 45:44.400
nothing to lose by calling
the estate agents later

45:44.400 --> 45:47.200
to find out what had happened
to Edith Bryant.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.760
No, just curious.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.640
And perhaps
everything to gain

45:51.640 --> 45:53.760
by spending time with George.

45:53.760 --> 45:55.600
Come on, let me buy you a drink.

45:55.600 --> 45:57.720
I want to hear all
about your adventures.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.280
Great.

46:25.440 --> 46:27.960
While unbeknown to Matilda,

46:27.960 --> 46:32.400
less than 2 miles,
612 yards away,

46:32.400 --> 46:35.200
another man with an interest
in our heroine

46:35.200 --> 46:39.080
also whiled away
the evening with her.

46:39.080 --> 46:43.840
That evening and many evenings
to come.
