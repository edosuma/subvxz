WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.571
Previously on Salvation...
Welcome to RE/SYST.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.173
We have a proposal for you.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.641
A cyber blackout of Russia's
entire satellite array

00:07.675 --> 00:09.277
and power system?

00:09.310 --> 00:11.579
Darius' dreams
have made you rich,

00:11.612 --> 00:14.482
and they've made the world
a better place.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.451
But as a businessman,
Darius is failing.

00:17.485 --> 00:21.155
I call on this board to remove
the CEO of Tanz Industries.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.424
GRACE: Zoe, get out of the car.
ZOE: I'm done with your lies.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.126
Just drive, Dylan.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.327
(engine starts)

00:26.360 --> 00:28.096
I have a nickname
for you-- it's Prick.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.331
Stop! Are you drunk?

00:30.364 --> 00:31.665
What I'm about to tell you all

00:31.699 --> 00:33.634
will cause some
concern, but I

00:33.667 --> 00:34.735
can assure you that...

00:34.768 --> 00:37.605
HARRIS: Get the medic!
Turn those cameras off now!

00:37.638 --> 00:38.806
Harris, open your eyes--
you've been played.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.074
I, Monroe Bennett,

00:40.108 --> 00:41.342
do solemnly swear

00:41.375 --> 00:42.776
that I will faithfully execute

00:42.810 --> 00:43.611
the Office of President

00:43.644 --> 00:45.779
of the United States,
so help me God.

00:45.813 --> 00:48.316
(whispers):
So help us God.

00:48.349 --> 00:51.752
BENNETT: I want to assure you,
my fellow citizens,

00:51.785 --> 00:53.354
that despite
President Mackenzie's

00:53.387 --> 00:55.189
very sudden
and heartbreaking passing,

00:55.223 --> 00:57.658
the ideals that she stood for--

00:57.691 --> 01:00.194
education for our children,

01:00.228 --> 01:03.831
jobs for all who seek them,
equal rights for all citizens--

01:03.864 --> 01:06.134
they will continue
to be pursued with vigor

01:06.167 --> 01:07.468
and with heart.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.738
Pauline Mackenzie was a wife,

01:10.771 --> 01:14.408
a mother,
a daughter and a patriot.

01:14.442 --> 01:17.311
And I promise to not only uphold
the high standards she met,

01:17.345 --> 01:20.248
but also the ones that she set.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.484
This is the greatest nation
in the world,

01:23.517 --> 01:25.586
and it is my honor
to now lead you,

01:25.619 --> 01:27.655
with hope, with faith,

01:27.688 --> 01:29.857
and into continued prosperity.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.659
May God bless us all,

01:31.692 --> 01:35.196
and may God bless
the United States of America.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.132
MAN:
And we're clear.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.134
Thank you, everybody.
Can you please clear the room?

01:40.168 --> 01:42.803
(indistinct chatter)

01:42.836 --> 01:45.439
Well, how'd I do?

01:45.473 --> 01:46.907
I'd follow you into battle.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.244
You are gonna make
a wonderful chief of staff.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.180
It's my privilege.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.516
We're gonna save
the world, Claire.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.551
And that is just the beginning.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.528
We need to talk.
Grace...

02:07.561 --> 02:10.364
we can't have these off-the-
record conversations anymore.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.200
This isn't about
gravity tractors

02:12.233 --> 02:13.867
or asteroids-- this
is about my daughter.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.369
And your son.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.339
What are you talking about?

02:18.372 --> 02:19.840
They're involved, Harris.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.542
I don't know how they
found each other,

02:21.575 --> 02:23.577
but they did-- I saw
them kissing in a car.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.513
And now Zoe's
gone AWOL.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.548
I need your help
to find her.
We just...

02:27.581 --> 02:29.417
lost our president,

02:29.450 --> 02:33.287
we've got an extinction-level
event hanging over us-- this...

02:33.321 --> 02:35.889
is not the most
pressing issue.
It is to me.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.726
I think whatever circles your
son's been trafficking in,

02:38.759 --> 02:40.294
he's brought Zoe
into the fold.

02:40.328 --> 02:43.697
Grace, he's an activist,
not a killer.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.366
And even if I wanted
to find him,

02:45.399 --> 02:46.900
I wouldn't know
where to look.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.902
He doesn't respond
to texts, to calls,

02:48.936 --> 02:50.771
doesn't tell me where he lives--
and my ex

02:50.804 --> 02:51.872
hasn't heard from him in weeks.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.907
Zoe's lying. She quit her job.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.244
She's hiding something.
So is Dylan.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.879
I promise you,
whatever's going on with them,

02:58.912 --> 03:02.250
it doesn't compare
to what's going on here.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.451
Something is wrong, Harris.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.319
I am telling you I know this.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.621
Until I find her, you and
this entire administration

03:07.655 --> 03:08.889
can go to hell.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.991
In fact, you know
what? I quit.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.793
I'm done here.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.296
Well, I don't accept
your resignation.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.964
I don't accept yours.

03:16.997 --> 03:20.401
I'm not coming back
until I find my daughter.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.304
SECRETARY:
Sir.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.005
The president has requested
your presence

03:25.038 --> 03:27.941
at the Oval Office,
immediately.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.744
NICHOLAS:
The reason for this meeting

03:30.778 --> 03:32.813
is to decide what
financial improprieties

03:32.846 --> 03:34.882
have taken place here at Tanz,

03:34.915 --> 03:36.984
and to look for a successor.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.986
TANZ:
Excellent.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.355
I've got a list of names.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.257
Well, we'll keep it
under advisement.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.725
If you had read
the bylaws,

03:44.758 --> 03:46.394
which I'm sure you
haven't, you'd know

03:46.427 --> 03:47.695
that I retain
my board membership

03:47.728 --> 03:49.363
no matter who you put
at the helm,

03:49.397 --> 03:51.265
and no matter how many
backstabbers in this room

03:51.299 --> 03:52.933
you try to pay off, Uncle.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.335
Page 42,

03:54.368 --> 03:56.003
paragraph six, subsection A,

03:56.036 --> 03:57.705
highlighted in orange

03:57.738 --> 04:00.308
for your convenience.
As a result

04:00.341 --> 04:02.776
of your recent shenanigans,

04:02.810 --> 04:06.314
the government has cut
all ties with Tanz.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.981
Your company has lost
more than half

04:08.015 --> 04:10.651
of its already shrinking value.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.020
This board has determined
that an audit

04:13.053 --> 04:14.322
is necessary.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.789
What happened

04:15.823 --> 04:17.358
to the money, Darius?

04:17.391 --> 04:19.527
Where did the billion dollars

04:19.560 --> 04:21.829
of Tanz Industries go?

04:21.862 --> 04:23.531
Well, if an audit is required,

04:23.564 --> 04:25.799
I say we have it done
by an expert.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.435
I nominate Theresa Peterson

04:27.468 --> 04:28.802
to oversee it.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.704
NICHOLAS:
Don't be ridiculous.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.706
TANZ:
She's a corporate attorney--
versed in mergers

04:32.740 --> 04:35.976
and acquisitions, forensic
accounting, if I'm not mistaken.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.346
Darius, I don't think
that's wise.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.381
NICHOLAS:
Well, then it probably is.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.884
Only someone who doesn't want
the job could be trusted.

04:43.917 --> 04:47.488
You have a vested interested
in discovering the truth.

04:47.521 --> 04:50.391
Something you'll
never hear from me.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.033
Good morning.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.336
How's the hangover?

05:03.103 --> 05:05.906
I'm sorry...
for last night.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.709
Please. With everything
that's been going on,

05:08.742 --> 05:10.744
you're entitled
to one crappy night.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.580
So, where is everyone?

05:12.613 --> 05:15.816
The Tanz Board of Directors
suspended all work

05:15.849 --> 05:17.818
in the Skybox.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.920
Something to do
with a financial audit.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.755
(whispers):
How's your day?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.791
Well, we lost communication
with the gravity tractor.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.092
And we have no idea

05:25.125 --> 05:27.595
how to get it back.
What does Darius say?

05:27.628 --> 05:30.130
Well, right now he's fighting
to keep control of Tanz.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.632
'Cause, I mean,
if he loses control

05:31.665 --> 05:33.367
of all this,
and there's no way

05:33.401 --> 05:35.436
to fix the GT,
we'll never finish the Ark.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.139
And all the work I've done here,
it just feels like...

05:39.172 --> 05:42.376
grabbing sand, like it's
slipping through my fingers.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.081
I wish we could have one day

05:48.115 --> 05:50.951
where we just went back...

05:50.984 --> 05:52.986
to being...

05:53.020 --> 05:55.022
normal.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.658
Yeah, me, too.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.095
Well, maybe we can.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.567
AMANDA:
What do you mean they pulled

06:06.600 --> 06:08.168
my credentials?
ED: In light
of the recent tragedy,

06:08.201 --> 06:10.671
the White House feels they
need a leaner press corps.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.706
Leaner?
This is punishment

06:12.740 --> 06:15.609
for my story
on Project Atlas, Ed.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.511
I'm being blackballed
because I scare them.

06:17.545 --> 06:20.047
And if I scare them, that means
there's more buried treasure.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.715
Look, the country is
on edge right now.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.084
And this new president has
the good will of the people.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.086
Nobody wants another scandal--
they want to feel safe.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.088
That's not my damn job.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.557
I'm not their mother.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.192
Traffic on our site
is up tenfold

06:32.225 --> 06:34.127
since all this broke.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.629
Let's see
them stop me.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.931
(quietly): Says the woman
who was run over by a car.

06:37.965 --> 06:41.201
Amanda, think before you do
something you're gonna regret.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.571
President Mackenzie prepared
an address to the nation

06:43.604 --> 06:45.973
but died before she
could deliver it in full.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.742
I'm gonna find out what
she never got to say.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.647
Claire tells me that you're
as trustworthy as they come.

06:53.681 --> 06:54.882
Which is what I
need right now.

06:54.915 --> 06:55.883
Which is what
the country needs.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.719
A few good patriots.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.220
I'll take the compliment, sir.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.690
Now, the most pressing issue
at this time--

07:02.723 --> 07:04.191
besides our Russian friends,
of course--

07:04.224 --> 07:06.560
is space.
CLAIRE: I've filled
President Bennett in

07:06.594 --> 07:09.029
on our prognosis
with Samson.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.064
We have a gravity tractor
en route right now

07:11.098 --> 07:12.500
to divert the asteroid.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.902
Which Russia knows
nothing about-- yet.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.169
Which is why we need to protect

07:16.203 --> 07:17.638
the gravity tractor
at all costs.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.873
That is the key.
The only indication

07:19.907 --> 07:24.177
of a threat at this moment is
from unpredictable elements.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.580
You're familiar
with the group RE/SYST?

07:26.614 --> 07:29.650
An underground hacktivist group
with international reach

07:29.683 --> 07:31.652
and a penchant for anarchy.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.688
Yes, I'm familiar.
Well, we've learned
they were responsible

07:34.722 --> 07:37.525
for hacking key
power grids in Russia,

07:37.558 --> 07:39.159
causing the blackouts
that enabled Darius Tanz

07:39.192 --> 07:40.861
to launch the
gravity tractor

07:40.894 --> 07:42.496
without detection.
So they helped us?

07:42.530 --> 07:43.831
BENNETT: Harris, they're
a mercenary organization,

07:43.864 --> 07:45.699
willing to create chaos

07:45.733 --> 07:47.901
of any kind for
the right price.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.237
(chuckles): Now... now is
not the time for chaos.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.672
CLAIRE:
A dossier

07:51.705 --> 07:53.907
on what we know
about RE/SYST.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.244
From what we understand,

07:57.277 --> 08:00.247
these are two
of the local leaders.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.915
Currently unidentified.

08:01.949 --> 08:02.983
BENNETT: They're
a clear and present danger

08:03.016 --> 08:04.585
to our national security.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.520
This is not just
some rebellion, Dad.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.522
I'm actually trying
to save the world.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.524
We need to
take them down.

08:10.558 --> 08:11.925
Can I count on you,

08:11.959 --> 08:13.594
Harris?

08:15.195 --> 08:17.565
(sighs)

08:17.598 --> 08:19.533
Yes, sir.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.902
Yes, you can.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.806
*

08:37.317 --> 08:39.186
GRACE: Yes, Mike, of course
I checked with her friends.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.321
I-I checked her room,
her things...

08:41.354 --> 08:42.656
(doorbell rings)

08:42.690 --> 08:44.858
Just call me
if you hear from her.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.832
Can I come in?

08:53.266 --> 08:55.869
RE/SYST?
Yeah.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.170
I just can't believe Zoe

08:57.204 --> 08:58.606
would get caught up
in something like this.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.973
If she's involved
with Dylan,

09:00.007 --> 09:01.709
believe it.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.344
President Bennett is treating
them as a terrorist cell.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.013
Wants them taken down.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.582
They're talking about
sending in a tactical team.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.516
What are we gonna do?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.852
I can't use Pentagon
sat-tech to locate them,

09:11.885 --> 09:15.222
because if I find them...
You've exposed them internally.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.324
So how do we find them?

09:17.357 --> 09:21.328
Darius worked with RE/SYST
to launch the gravity tractor.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.330
See what he can do.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.599
We have to get
to them, Grace,

09:25.633 --> 09:28.235
before anyone else does.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.375
JILLIAN:
So, what is it

09:35.408 --> 09:36.810
we're trying to accomplish here?

09:36.844 --> 09:38.211
LIAM:
We are gonna pretend

09:38.245 --> 09:39.647
for one day
that everything is normal.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.381
We're gonna do what
normal people do.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.116
JILLIAN:
So...

09:43.150 --> 09:44.652
we're gonna eat
cookies...

09:44.685 --> 09:46.353
and drink...

09:46.386 --> 09:47.755
root beer?

09:47.788 --> 09:49.657
Play Frisbee and...

09:49.690 --> 09:52.059
shoot water guns?

09:52.092 --> 09:53.761
Exactly.
(chuckles)

09:53.794 --> 09:55.763
*

09:55.796 --> 09:57.097
Today is all about the fun.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.132
Deal?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.367
* Never to return

10:00.400 --> 10:01.301
Deal.

10:01.334 --> 10:05.305
* But don't hang your head
in sorrow *

10:05.338 --> 10:09.009
* For now is
just a thought away *

10:09.042 --> 10:12.746
* You can't do everything
with all of your tomorrows *

10:12.780 --> 10:14.648
* But you can do
anything today *

10:14.682 --> 10:17.284
*

10:31.464 --> 10:33.801
Bucket list. Go.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.937
Machu Picchu.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.139
Biking through Provence.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.441
Meeting Neil deGrasse Tyson.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.212
Having a book on the The New
York Times Best Seller list.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.280
Sex in space.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.316
(laughs): Seriously?
Yeah.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.285
Yeah, it's never been done--
only in the movies.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.888
(sighs)
Next.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.257
(baby coos)
Yeah.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.358
JILLIAN:
Getting married.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.427
Having kids.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.862
A boy and a girl.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.263
And a house.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.432
A big yard and
a big ol' dog.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.399
Mm.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.737
Yeah, like the kind
that sheds everywhere,

11:09.770 --> 11:11.471
and has a big ol' sloppy beard

11:11.504 --> 11:14.407
that's just dripping
with water.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.711
Hey.

11:17.745 --> 11:18.746
Hey, no.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.213
No, no, no, no, no.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.282
No sad today, only happy.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.151
(crying): It's just
we're never gonna

11:24.184 --> 11:26.053
get any of those things.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.155
No, you don't know that.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.723
Okay, why don't we
try to do

11:29.757 --> 11:31.458
one thing on our
bucket list today

11:31.491 --> 11:34.094
just so we can say
that we knocked one out.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.429
We can't really do anything

11:36.463 --> 11:39.699
unless you know Neil
deGrasse Tyson's address.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.147
Marry me.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.149
(quietly):
Moving a little fast.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.518
It's only our second date.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.989
No, I'm serious.
What are we waiting for?

12:02.022 --> 12:04.758
Jillian, I love you.
I'm not afraid to say it.

12:07.260 --> 12:11.431
You can say no,
just say something.

12:11.464 --> 12:15.202
I love you, Liam Cole.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.038
I've loved you since
the moment I saw you

12:18.071 --> 12:20.207
without your
stupid shoes.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.783
Ms. Barrows, can I help
you with something?

12:29.817 --> 12:31.885
Is Darius here?
I need to see him right away.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.120
FEMALE VOICE:
Security breach.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.955
Attention, all personnel.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.523
A security breach
has been detected.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.191
What's happening?
Ma'am,

12:38.225 --> 12:40.393
I'm gonna need
to see your purse, please.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.564
I promised you
full transparency.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.299
Everything is there
for you to see.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.202
Well, what I see is someone
drowning in debt.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.404
And yet, it seems like each time
you're overleveraged,

12:51.438 --> 12:54.407
it's because you're close
to a major breakthrough.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.143
Not close.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.078
Already there.
Well then,

12:58.111 --> 13:00.080
why won't you
just explain that

13:00.113 --> 13:02.883
to your uncle and the board
and end this impasse?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.918
Because...

13:04.952 --> 13:07.020
you're just gonna have
to trust me on this one.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.322
I can't.

13:09.356 --> 13:13.526
Darius, what you have
done here is revolutionary.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.396
The world needs
Tanz Industries.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.866
My brother died
trying to protect it.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.968
I will not let that
be for nothing.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.235
It wasn't for nothing.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.471
It's for everything.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.908
You need to trust me
with this secret project

13:27.941 --> 13:31.578
or else I am selling my shares
and walking away.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.047
(phone vibrates)

13:34.081 --> 13:35.548
(sighs)

13:35.582 --> 13:38.551
Karissa, what's going on?

13:38.585 --> 13:40.553
I'll be right there.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.323
There's something I-I need to
attend to on the main floor.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.925
Of course.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.098
MAN: I'm sorry, ma'am, we've
been instructed to detain you.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.600
GRACE: No, no, there must
be some misunderstanding.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.902
I have full clearance here.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.236
Darius, there's
a security breach?

13:56.269 --> 13:57.871
What's going on?

13:57.905 --> 14:00.607
Grace, I'm afraid
the security breach is you.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.949
Can I get another?

14:08.982 --> 14:10.350
AMANDA:
Make that two,

14:10.383 --> 14:12.519
so no one can call
it drinking alone.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.587
Thanks.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.555
Got a little...

14:15.588 --> 14:16.924
Oh, damn it, sorry.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.059
Thank you.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.930
Thank you.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.631
And thank you.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.669
But as much as I always
appreciate a free drink,

14:29.702 --> 14:32.505
you can stop the
"cozying up" act.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.308
I know who you are,
Miss Atlas,

14:35.342 --> 14:37.510
from Capitol Eyes.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.147
What do you want?

14:40.180 --> 14:43.383
You were President Mackenzie's
chief speech writer.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.618
And I want to know
what she was gonna

14:45.652 --> 14:47.955
tell the country before she...

14:47.988 --> 14:51.524
I don't know.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.693
Mackenzie wouldn't tell anyone.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.296
She insisted on writing
that speech herself,

14:56.329 --> 14:57.630
behind closed doors.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.467
She locked herself
in the Oval for hours.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.603
Said she was having trouble
focusing.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.309
Should've seen the signs.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.978
Maybe if I had said something...

15:11.011 --> 15:13.113
Hey.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.148
You can't blame yourself.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.721
But you can honor
her wishes.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.291
Help me find out what
she was gonna tell the country.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.734
(computer beeps)
TANZ: Just as I thought.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.369
What? What is it?

15:43.210 --> 15:45.612
Someone bugged your phone.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.080
Your cell was hacked
using spy software,

15:47.114 --> 15:49.516
turning it into
an open microphone.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.618
So someone's been listening
to everything I say?

15:51.651 --> 15:52.685
Trying to.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.587
They'll run into firewalls here
and at the Pentagon.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.723
There's no telling
what anyone's heard.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.658
Any idea who
could have done this?

15:58.691 --> 16:00.093
Who has access
to your phone?

16:00.127 --> 16:01.694
(sighs)

16:04.064 --> 16:05.365
GRACE: Were you
going through my purse?

16:05.398 --> 16:07.567
Yeah. Can I borrow $20?

16:11.738 --> 16:14.674
Darius, my daughter
is in real trouble.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.683
Now that I've disabled
the microphone,

16:23.716 --> 16:26.553
we can see where the signal
is being transmitted.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.324
RE/SYST is in a building

16:31.358 --> 16:35.128
in the old warehouse district,
about 15 miles from here.

16:35.162 --> 16:35.728
Thank you.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.064
You can't go there alone.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.398
I'll-I'll come with you.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.667
No, I need to save my baby.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.303
(sighs)
And you need to save yours.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.362
(indistinct chatter)

17:11.231 --> 17:12.632
NICHOLAS:
Oh...

17:12.665 --> 17:15.068
what have you
learned, Theresa?

17:16.469 --> 17:20.607
I've learned that...

17:20.640 --> 17:23.510
Darius's happiness
is your misery.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.513
Why is that?

17:26.546 --> 17:29.149
Darius...

17:29.182 --> 17:33.820
is not the only one
to have loved and lost.

17:36.456 --> 17:41.428
I expect a full report
in the morning. Ah.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.169
*

18:01.481 --> 18:03.783
You still play.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.553
(clears throat)
Not so much anymore.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.423
Darius.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.862
I... I saw her out there.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.531
Tess.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.867
Kind of hard to miss.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.403
(both chuckle softly)

18:23.436 --> 18:26.306
I'm not sure whether I
should be flattered or...

18:26.339 --> 18:27.540
or heartbroken.

18:27.574 --> 18:33.180
I never expected you
to walk through these doors.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.586
I've missed you, Darius.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.692
I... I've missed you, too.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.630
Do you believe
in second chances?

19:01.608 --> 19:04.244
I never thought I'd get
a chance to do that again.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.679
Me, either.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.823
JILLIAN:
Are you sure it's okay

19:16.856 --> 19:18.758
ambushing your mother
at work like this?

19:18.791 --> 19:20.593
Don't worry.
She's gonna love you.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.529
Could you page Eleanor
Cole for me, please?

19:22.562 --> 19:24.464
Yes, and you are?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.599
Liam? Liam!

19:26.633 --> 19:28.635
Oh, baby.
Mom.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.703
(laughs): Oh.

19:30.737 --> 19:33.606
What are you doing here?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.278
Liam's doing
some incredible work.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.247
Oh, I knew he'd
do amazing things

19:40.280 --> 19:42.215
from the moment I saw him.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.483
When was that exactly?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.418
Oh.

19:45.452 --> 19:48.221
No, Mom, don't, please.
No.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.622
Oh, no, please do.
I want to know it all.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.925
Okay, so, it was
Christmas Eve

19:52.959 --> 19:55.862
and, uh, we had had
eight births that night.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.597
It was like
an infant armada.

19:57.630 --> 20:01.534
(laughs)
And when my 15-hour shift

20:01.568 --> 20:04.604
was finally over,

20:04.637 --> 20:06.639
that's when
I heard the cry.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.241
I mean,
I was on my way

20:08.275 --> 20:09.809
out of the hospital.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.711
I thought it was
an alley cat at first,

20:11.744 --> 20:15.782
but... then I saw him.

20:15.815 --> 20:19.586
This shrieking,
red-faced bundle of baby

20:19.619 --> 20:22.655
with more intelligence
and fortitude

20:22.689 --> 20:26.759
in those big brown eyes
than I had ever seen.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.596
So, he was left here
at the hospital?

20:29.629 --> 20:30.797
ELEANOR:
Yeah.

20:30.830 --> 20:34.301
A teenage girl had
left him there.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.403
She couldn't take care of
him; that's all we knew.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.838
So...

20:38.871 --> 20:40.473
Mom...
(chuckles)

20:40.507 --> 20:44.010
uh... we came here
to surprise you.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.645
We, Jillian and I,

20:45.678 --> 20:48.648
are... getting married.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.651
Today.

20:51.684 --> 20:52.985
Married?
(laughs)

20:53.019 --> 20:56.556
How long you two
been together?

20:56.589 --> 20:58.358
Uh, 53 days, on and off.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.660
Mm-hmm.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.630
Jillian, do you mind if I speak
with my child, please? Alone.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.598
Of course. Yep.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.602
What are you doing?

21:09.636 --> 21:10.937
A girl you hardly know,
you bring her here,

21:10.970 --> 21:12.972
you tell me you want
to marry her today.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.707
Do you want to give me
a heart attack?

21:14.741 --> 21:15.875
I-I know that it
seems impulsive...

21:15.908 --> 21:17.076
No, it doesn't
seem impulsive.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.579
It i impulsive.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.614
Oh, no, is she pregnant?

21:21.648 --> 21:22.915
What? No.
Well, please,

21:22.949 --> 21:24.917
help me understand.
What is your hurry?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.688
(laughs softly)

21:30.690 --> 21:34.026
I can't, I can't
make you understand.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.795
Listen, Liam, I have
never held my tongue.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.330
I'm not about to
start now.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.699
I can't support
this decision.

21:39.732 --> 21:43.603
This doesn't feel like love;
it feels like desperation.

21:43.636 --> 21:47.039
If it's right,
you should be able to wait

21:47.073 --> 21:50.710
and have a proper wedding
with her family and yours.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.747
(sighs)

21:54.781 --> 21:56.816
I need to get back
to my shift.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.767
Wait. Where
are you going?

22:14.801 --> 22:16.603
Inside. With you.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.605
If my daughter's in there...
The last person

22:18.638 --> 22:20.907
she'll want to listen to
right now is her mother.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.909
I'll talk to her, okay?

22:22.942 --> 22:24.811
You have to trust me
to handle this.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.913
Oh, come on, please
don't use that word.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.650
I know about the bait and switch
you pulled.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.685
With the gravity tractor.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.587
Darius says he's
lost control of it,

22:34.621 --> 22:36.523
that it's being
weaponized...

22:36.556 --> 22:37.990
to save us,
(sighs)

22:38.024 --> 22:39.859
destroy others.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.096
(scoffs)
Grace,

22:44.130 --> 22:46.566
there are darker forces
at play here.

22:46.599 --> 22:49.802
And I promise you I will get
to the bottom of this.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.704
But until I do...

22:51.738 --> 22:54.106
you're just gonna have
to trust me.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.008
(sighs)

22:56.042 --> 22:59.412
(softly):
Harris, get them out.

22:59.446 --> 23:00.947
Safely.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.554
*

23:32.211 --> 23:33.980
*

23:43.690 --> 23:44.757
WOMAN:
Don't move.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.839
Do you have any idea who the
hell you're dealing with?

23:59.872 --> 24:00.973
Yeah. The other cog

24:01.007 --> 24:03.510
in the military-industrial
complex wheel.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.978
DYLAN:
And my father.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.082
I got this.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.061
HARRIS: So this is why
you dropped out of college.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.229
This is your life now?

24:23.262 --> 24:24.831
We're freedom fighters.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.065
RE/SYST isn't the
benevolent entity

24:26.098 --> 24:28.034
you think it is.
Look, if you're talking

24:28.067 --> 24:29.802
about what happened
last summer in Idaho,

24:29.836 --> 24:31.904
we just exposed the truth
about those supremacists.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.272
The National Guard
started the firefight.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.242
Dumping information,
however true, has consequences.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.678
Oh, my God,
open your eyes.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.913
Look at the institution
you serve for once.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.783
I'm not here to lecture you,
I'm here to warn you.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.119
They're coming for you. Soon.

24:47.153 --> 24:51.023
You have a few hours to pack up
and get out of here.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.526
Why are you telling
me all this?

24:53.560 --> 24:56.062
Because I don't want anything
to happen to you...

24:56.095 --> 24:58.030
or Zoe.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.000
Zoe's not here.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.971
She's breaking
her mother's heart.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.073
If you know
where she is, please...

25:07.106 --> 25:08.908
I...

25:08.941 --> 25:11.578
I can't tell you.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.312
Okay? But I can tell
you that she's safe.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.114
I have a car outside.

25:15.147 --> 25:18.017
Can walk out of here with me,
no questions asked.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.686
Sorry. You have your fight,

25:19.719 --> 25:21.721
I have mine.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.055
I know.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.024
And I respect that.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.893
The government needs resistance

25:26.926 --> 25:29.128
to keep their power
in check.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.331
And it takes very brave people

25:32.364 --> 25:34.801
to stand up
to that kind of power.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.269
(sighs)

25:42.141 --> 25:44.877
I love you.

25:44.911 --> 25:47.614
Know that.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.588
This is Mackenzie's entire
handwritten speech.

25:55.622 --> 25:56.723
How did you get this?

25:56.756 --> 25:58.124
Her speechwriter.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.059
Mackenzie gave it to her right
before she went on the air.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.260
Does anyone else know
you have this?

26:03.029 --> 26:04.731
Okay, there are
words missing,

26:04.764 --> 26:06.799
and they've been replaced
with numbers?

26:06.833 --> 26:08.901
It's a kind of code.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.370
A lot of eyeballs
usually saw her speeches

26:11.403 --> 26:14.006
before they were televised,
but this one,

26:14.040 --> 26:16.108
Mackenzie was paranoid--
it's her only copy,

26:16.142 --> 26:18.010
and it didn't even make it
to the teleprompter.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.913
Okay, so other than a lot of
nonsense, what do we know?

26:20.947 --> 26:24.016
Just that she learned about
something called Project Samson

26:24.050 --> 26:25.384
four months ago.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.354
Something she refers to as
"a potential apocalypse."

26:28.387 --> 26:30.723
Apocalypse?

26:30.757 --> 26:32.291
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

26:32.324 --> 26:35.161
It means if Atlas was
the story of the year,

26:35.194 --> 26:38.931
Samson's the story
of the century.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.399
THERESA:
Where are we going?

26:40.432 --> 26:42.234
TANZ: You want to know
where the money went?

26:43.803 --> 26:45.337
I'm gonna show
you my secret.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.839
TESS:
Welcome, Darius.

26:46.873 --> 26:49.776
But you have to
promise not to tell.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.143
The Mars project.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.647
It's done.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.919
It's incredible.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.855
Why all the secrecy?

27:02.889 --> 27:04.657
I'm afraid the
government will seize it

27:04.691 --> 27:07.760
or that Nicholas will sell
seats to the highest bidder.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.662
It needs to
be protected.

27:12.164 --> 27:15.868
I had to spend the money to
expedite the project because...

27:15.902 --> 27:17.036
Because...

27:17.069 --> 27:18.938
the world is going to hell

27:18.971 --> 27:21.040
quicker than anyone
could have imagined,

27:21.073 --> 27:22.408
and you needed to be sure

27:22.441 --> 27:24.110
we could start over
somewhere.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.344
Something like that.

27:25.377 --> 27:28.114
There's a seat
here for you.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.182
And your children.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.184
Should the need ever arise.

27:37.123 --> 27:40.693
You know, most kids
just dream of being a...

27:40.727 --> 27:43.295
fireman or a policeman
or a doctor.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.299
You weren't
just any kid.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.304
(quietly):
Neither were you.

27:57.176 --> 27:57.977
(intercom beeps)

27:59.311 --> 28:02.481
MAN: Satellite pharmacy,
pick up 2251.

28:02.514 --> 28:06.919
Satellite pharmacy,
pick up 2251.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.159
Mom.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.796
I thought
I'd scared you off.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.431
I'm sorry I was
so harsh with you.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.067
No. No, no, no.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.434
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.303
I disappeared.
I haven't seen you in weeks.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.938
And then,
when I finally come around,

28:25.972 --> 28:28.074
I drop a huge bomb on you.

28:28.107 --> 28:33.312
All I ever wanted was
for you to have a bright future.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.281
You were my miracle.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.450
And when you first saw me,

28:38.484 --> 28:41.253
how long did it take
until you knew...

28:41.287 --> 28:43.189
you know, y-you knew
we were meant to be?

28:43.222 --> 28:45.024
(chuckles softly)

28:45.057 --> 28:49.028
I knew it from the moment
I laid eyes on you.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.429
That's the
feeling I had

28:50.462 --> 28:52.464
when I met Jillian.

28:55.034 --> 28:58.204
Time is precious, Ma.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.506
I don't want to waste it.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.977
You got a ring?

29:06.813 --> 29:08.480
Ah! (chuckles)

29:08.514 --> 29:09.548
(groans)

29:09.581 --> 29:12.018
You're not always a genius,
are you?

29:12.051 --> 29:13.219
Ah!

29:13.252 --> 29:14.386
(both chuckle)

29:16.588 --> 29:20.059
Aw. Grandma's ring?

29:20.092 --> 29:23.229
She loved you so.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.369
THERESA:
Darius,

29:30.402 --> 29:32.071
if you won't tell the
board about Salvation...

29:32.104 --> 29:33.272
I know, I know.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.941
They're not gonna
take your word for it.

29:34.974 --> 29:37.209
They want proof
where the money went.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.377
Especially Nicholas.

29:38.410 --> 29:39.979
I asked him

29:40.012 --> 29:41.814
why he wants to cause
you such misery,

29:41.848 --> 29:44.050
and he said the
strangest thing.

29:44.083 --> 29:47.987
He said you weren't the only
one to have loved and lost.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.991
What do you think
he meant?

29:58.264 --> 30:02.068
So, Tess has rightly explained
that if I want you all

30:02.101 --> 30:03.235
to understand
where the money went,

30:03.269 --> 30:06.172
I must show you all
my secret project.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.240
If you please,
Nicholas, as chairman

30:08.274 --> 30:10.910
of this operation,
I propose that

30:10.943 --> 30:12.244
you and I voyage
to do this together,

30:12.278 --> 30:14.847
the two of us.

30:14.881 --> 30:17.416
Then you can all decide
how to proceed after that.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.919
Very well.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.621
And bring an air sickness bag.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.857
We're going flying.

30:24.891 --> 30:28.294
BENNETT: You found their
location, a member count,

30:28.327 --> 30:30.162
a weapons and defensive position
assessment.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.264
Incredible work, Harris.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.466
Thank you, sir.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.202
We have
the location for now,

30:36.235 --> 30:38.337
but RE/SYST is
a nomadic entity.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.439
Which is why we have
to mobilize immediately.

30:40.472 --> 30:41.874
We're taking them out.

30:41.908 --> 30:44.176
They're an obstacle
we can't afford right now.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.644
"Taking them out"?

30:45.677 --> 30:48.280
I'm ordering a strike team,

30:48.314 --> 30:50.282
unless you have
any objections.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.419
No, sir.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.454
They're a terrorist
organization.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.192
They must be stopped.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.955
(chuckles softly)

31:33.492 --> 31:34.693
Liam.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.629
Yeah? What's wrong?

31:40.432 --> 31:43.169
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.315
NICHOLAS:
Where exactly are we

31:56.348 --> 32:00.119
going to see
this secret project?

32:00.152 --> 32:02.254
Nowhere.

32:02.288 --> 32:05.491
I thought we just needed
a little bonding time.

32:05.524 --> 32:09.361
Obviously, you have something
you need to get off your chest.

32:09.395 --> 32:13.365
The physics of aerodynamics
are really quite fascinating.

32:13.399 --> 32:17.003
You've got two major
forces at play:

32:17.036 --> 32:19.405
the lift off the
wings pulling us up

32:19.438 --> 32:21.740
and gravity
pulling us down.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.509
I am aware of that.

32:23.542 --> 32:27.113
It's a tug-of-war, a
balance of two implacable

32:27.146 --> 32:29.515
forces of physics.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.118
If I cut the engine...

32:32.151 --> 32:34.520
(engine slowing)

32:34.553 --> 32:38.024
(thunder rumbles)

32:38.057 --> 32:39.525
...the only lift we get

32:39.558 --> 32:41.193
is through our own momentum,

32:41.227 --> 32:42.394
which isn't enough.

32:42.428 --> 32:45.397
I-I figure we've got
about 90 seconds

32:45.431 --> 32:47.299
before impact.

32:47.333 --> 32:50.669
So, what, you're...
you're going to commit suicide?

32:50.702 --> 32:52.304
Well, I suppose suicide

32:52.338 --> 32:54.240
would be the legal
terminology in my case.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.243
In your case,
it's probably murder.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.445
(thunder rumbles)
You're insane.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.547
So I've been told, repeatedly.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.316
Locked you out.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.584
Sorry, Uncle.

33:07.453 --> 33:10.222
(Tanz whistles)

33:10.256 --> 33:12.691
Nice to see you're
capable of human emotion.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.527
Even if that
emotion is fear.

33:15.561 --> 33:19.331
That's as... ridiculous
as it is unfair.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.333
Is it?

33:21.367 --> 33:24.336
Who drilled in me that emotions
are the enemy of success?

33:24.370 --> 33:26.605
That to achieve at the
highest level, you must

33:26.638 --> 33:29.508
divorce one's self
from the chains of love?

33:29.541 --> 33:30.509
Yes, I raised you.

33:30.542 --> 33:33.512
I raised you and I made you
what you are today!

33:33.545 --> 33:36.148
You destroyed me and
everything that mattered to me.

33:36.182 --> 33:39.151
And... and now the
destruction continues.

33:39.185 --> 33:42.254
Why? I want answers.
(alert beeping)

33:42.288 --> 33:44.556
Who did you love and lose,
Uncle?

33:44.590 --> 33:46.792
Darius, you-you stop this now.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.727
(alert continues beeping)

33:48.760 --> 33:50.462
I want an answer.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.731
Or prepare for impact.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.744
You've got to stop
this nonsense, Darius.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.114
Who did you
love and lose?

34:08.147 --> 34:10.449
Oh, come on.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.384
You've got about
50 seconds to convince me

34:12.418 --> 34:14.720
there's something other
than ice and bourbon

34:14.753 --> 34:16.288
coursing through
your veins.

34:16.322 --> 34:17.756
Who was it?!

34:19.458 --> 34:21.227
Your mother.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.097
Claudia.

34:25.131 --> 34:27.533
I met her first.

34:27.566 --> 34:30.602
Asked her to marry me.

34:30.636 --> 34:33.772
But then he came
into the picture, your father.

34:33.805 --> 34:37.109
What the hell are
you talking about?

34:37.143 --> 34:38.877
He stole her away from me,

34:38.910 --> 34:42.148
so I stole you away from him.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.882
From both of them.

34:43.915 --> 34:49.288
But despite
my cruel intentions...

34:49.321 --> 34:52.624
I did love you,

34:52.658 --> 34:56.128
as if you were
my own son.

34:56.162 --> 34:57.629
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Brace for impact.

34:59.165 --> 35:01.467
Brace for impact.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.169
Brace for
impact.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.575
What are you doing?

35:09.608 --> 35:12.378
The only way to generate lift

35:12.411 --> 35:14.380
is to go forward.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.354
(distant siren wailing)

35:25.891 --> 35:27.926
I'm sorry.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.595
It's okay. I understand
why you got cold feet.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.163
This whole thing
is just crazy.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.431
I didn't get
cold feet.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.901
I want to marry you, Liam,
more than anything.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.138
But?

35:41.207 --> 35:44.243
Your mother's right.

35:44.276 --> 35:46.678
This is desperation.

35:46.712 --> 35:49.381
This is an act
of hopelessness.

35:49.415 --> 35:52.351
One grand, romantic gesture

35:52.384 --> 35:55.887
before... the end of the world.

35:55.921 --> 35:58.290
It's saying that
we don't believe in the future.

35:58.324 --> 36:01.260
And I'm...

36:01.293 --> 36:02.894
I'm not ready to say that.

36:02.928 --> 36:06.498
You solved
the EmDrive.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.901
You can solve whatever's
in front of you.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.704
I believe in you.
I know.

36:12.738 --> 36:15.941
Kind of scares the crap
out of me, if I'm being honest.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.244
(chuckles softly)

36:19.378 --> 36:22.481
No matter what happens,
we're together.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.716
To the end.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.986
Whether that's 130 days

36:28.019 --> 36:30.188
or 130 years.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.659
Deal?

36:34.893 --> 36:35.961
Deal.

36:39.365 --> 36:40.966
ELEANOR:
Everything all right?

36:40.999 --> 36:43.235
JILLIAN: We're gonna
take your advice, Ms. Cole.

36:43.269 --> 36:44.803
We're gonna wait.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.572
Have a proper wedding.

36:46.605 --> 36:49.341
Good.

36:49.375 --> 36:52.878
'Cause I could use a little
more time to find a dress.

36:52.911 --> 36:53.979
(chuckles)

37:05.424 --> 37:06.425
(indistinct radio chatter)

37:06.458 --> 37:08.327
MAN 1 (over radio):
You are clear to proceed.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.497
MAN 2:
Copy that, Delta five.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.299
In position and moving in.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.336
(devices beeping)

37:18.337 --> 37:20.606
MAN 2:
30 seconds to detonation.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.007
Clear the area.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.678
NEWSMAN: This is News Chopper
Four on the scene

37:26.712 --> 37:29.615
with our ongoing coverage
of a huge gas explosion

37:29.648 --> 37:32.418
that occurred an hour ago
outside the downtown area

37:32.451 --> 37:33.952
and engulfed
an abandoned factory.

37:33.985 --> 37:36.422
Casualties still remain
uncertain.
(doorbell rings)

37:36.455 --> 37:39.057
Harris, did you see?

37:39.090 --> 37:41.026
They-they blew the place up.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.762
Look, Dylan knew to get out and
he promised me Zoe is safe.

37:43.795 --> 37:44.963
You're sure?

37:44.996 --> 37:46.998
Yes.
Okay.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.667
Okay.

37:54.005 --> 37:57.042
Look, Grace.

37:57.075 --> 38:00.446
Something is rotten
at the highest levels.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.514
Our democracy
hangs by a thread

38:02.548 --> 38:04.483
and so does the
world right now.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.585
So, what are you
gonna do?

38:06.618 --> 38:08.554
Whatever I have to.

38:08.587 --> 38:11.890
I'll do the same.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.925
You're not quitting?

38:13.959 --> 38:16.362
Harris, I'm in this fight

38:16.395 --> 38:18.464
till the end.

38:18.497 --> 38:21.400
It could be at great
sacrifice to both of us.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.735
Whatever it takes.

38:30.576 --> 38:32.611
(door opens and closes)

38:44.390 --> 38:46.958
Arsenic on the rocks?

38:46.992 --> 38:48.727
50-year-old single malt.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.729
Your favorite, I believe.

38:50.762 --> 38:54.766
From a murder/suicide

38:54.800 --> 38:58.837
to a very expensive toast.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.906
I never know what
to expect from you.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.642
We're celebrating
our agreement

39:03.675 --> 39:06.144
to leave me on as CEO.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.415
I-I don't remember
agreeing to that.

39:09.448 --> 39:11.650
I'll handle R&D,
product development,

39:11.683 --> 39:14.420
and long-term planning,
the face of the company.

39:14.453 --> 39:18.089
You'll handle the business
side and investment strategy,

39:18.123 --> 39:21.993
which is what gives you
joy for some reason.

39:22.027 --> 39:25.096
And if I say no?

39:25.130 --> 39:26.898
Uncle.

39:26.932 --> 39:31.069
You and I, we're like
a family from Pompeii,

39:31.102 --> 39:33.872
covered in ash...

39:33.905 --> 39:37.409
buried for eternity.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.180
It's time we smashed out.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.883
(glasses clink)

39:44.916 --> 39:48.954
Well, then
it's settled then.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.593
Mmm.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.399
For now.

40:02.968 --> 40:06.137
Uncle.

40:06.171 --> 40:10.408
I'm sorry for your heartbreak.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.485
THERESA: So, you put the past
to bed with Nicholas?

40:19.518 --> 40:21.753
TANZ:
Best as we could.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.755
Putting the past to bed
is never easy.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.660
Tess.

40:33.131 --> 40:36.134
You asked me if I believe
in second chances.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.603
I do.

40:37.636 --> 40:42.941
But I also believe
in timing and...

40:42.974 --> 40:46.612
well, I think...
for us...

40:46.645 --> 40:50.482
Now is not the time.

40:50.516 --> 40:53.218
I know.

40:53.251 --> 40:56.154
Guess there's something
about tree houses

40:56.187 --> 40:59.224
that makes us all dreamers.

40:59.257 --> 41:01.827
(chuckles softly)

41:01.860 --> 41:03.461
Yeah.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.045
(door opens)

41:23.148 --> 41:25.517
Harris. Come in.

41:28.053 --> 41:30.021
Where's the president?

41:30.055 --> 41:33.058
He was called away.

41:33.091 --> 41:35.527
We just got word.

41:35.561 --> 41:37.195
The operation at
RE/SYST headquarters,

41:37.228 --> 41:38.864
it was a success.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.633
We crippled their
tech capabilities

41:41.667 --> 41:44.235
and as for their
local members...

41:49.107 --> 41:51.977
This footage was shot

41:52.010 --> 41:54.880
by an on-site drone.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.649
Six bodies were recovered.

41:59.250 --> 42:02.120
The president is
extremely pleased.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.289
With your help, a dangerous
terror organization

42:04.322 --> 42:05.991
has been deeply damaged.

42:06.024 --> 42:10.629
I think it's fair to
say he trusts you now.

42:12.631 --> 42:15.667
And what does this
newfound trust get me?

42:15.701 --> 42:19.605
Access to the inner circle.

42:21.673 --> 42:23.041
Good.

42:28.179 --> 42:30.749
I believe a celebration
is in order.

42:32.751 --> 42:35.821
Can I interest you
in a drink?

42:35.854 --> 42:37.623
I'd like that.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.836
(Harris sighs)
