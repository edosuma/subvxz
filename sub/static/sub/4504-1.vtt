02:29.830 --> 02:33.130
[school bell ringing]

02:35.590 --> 02:37.510
- WELCOME BACK, FELIX.

02:37.510 --> 02:39.010
- IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK, GARY.

02:39.010 --> 02:40.720
- IT SAYS HERE THAT YOU'VE HAD
TWO SUSPENSIONS

02:40.720 --> 02:42.350
IN THE LAST SEMESTER.

02:42.350 --> 02:45.140
- OH, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THREE.

02:45.140 --> 02:46.180
- TWO, FELIX.

02:46.180 --> 02:47.850
TWO SUSPENSIONS.

02:47.850 --> 02:49.350
THE FIRST WAS IN SEPTEMBER

02:49.350 --> 02:51.690
FOR REWIRING THE CHEERLEADERS
FUND-RAISER MONEY

02:51.690 --> 02:53.940
TO A KOALA BEAR SANCTUARY.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.030
- NOBLE CAUSE, DON'T YOU THINK?

02:58.030 --> 03:00.200
- I THINK YOU OWE AN APOLOGY
TO A DOZEN CHEERLEADERS.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.820
- I THINK THERE ARE
TWO DOZEN KOALAS

03:01.820 --> 03:03.530
THAT WOULD DISAGREE
WITH THAT, GARY.

03:03.530 --> 03:05.540
- AND THEN AGAIN, IN OCTOBER

03:05.540 --> 03:07.370
FOR PROGRAMMING
THE GYM SCOREBOARD

03:07.370 --> 03:10.210
TO DISPLAY AN INDECENT PHOTO
OF MRS. JENSEN.

03:13.250 --> 03:14.420
- WHOO!

03:14.420 --> 03:16.210
- I THINK I DID EVERYONE A FAVOR
WITH THAT ONE.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.260
- I'M NOT GONNA PLAY GAMES
WITH YOU, FELIX.

03:18.260 --> 03:19.930
TWO SUSPENSIONS
IN A SINGLE SEMESTER

03:19.930 --> 03:21.640
IS UNHEARD OF HERE AT EASTWOOD.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.350
- MR. TRUMAN, I UNDERSTAND

03:23.350 --> 03:26.010
I'M--I'M NOT WHAT YOU'D CONSIDER
AN EXEMPLARY STUDENT.

03:26.010 --> 03:27.930
BUT I BELIEVE I PLAY
A PIVOTAL ROLE

03:27.930 --> 03:29.230
IN THE OPERATIONS
OF THIS SCHOOL.

03:29.230 --> 03:31.770
IF I WASN'T HERE TO TEST
THE RULES,

03:31.770 --> 03:34.400
HOW WOULD THE OTHER STUDENTS
EVEN KNOW THEY EXISTED?

03:34.400 --> 03:36.780
- TODAY I WAS TOLD

03:36.780 --> 03:38.820
THAT YOU HACKED
THE VENDING MACHINES

03:38.820 --> 03:40.570
TO GIVE OUT
FREE GUM TO STUDENTS.

03:40.570 --> 03:42.240
IS THAT TRUE?

03:42.240 --> 03:43.740
- GUM?

03:43.740 --> 03:45.950
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET EXPELLED?

03:45.950 --> 03:48.790
- AND DENY YOU THE PLEASURE
OF MY COMPANY?

03:48.790 --> 03:51.540
[chuckles]

03:51.540 --> 03:55.130
- I'M EXPELLING YOU, FELIX.

03:55.130 --> 03:56.670
THAT'S IT.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.920
- WAIT.
SERIOUSLY?

03:58.920 --> 04:00.920
- THAT WAS YOUR THIRD STRIKE.

04:00.920 --> 04:04.140
- SO THAT MEANS I-I CAN'T COME
TO CLASS ANYMORE?

04:04.140 --> 04:07.510
- OH, YOU'LL NEVER SET FOOT
IN THE SCHOOL AGAIN.

04:07.510 --> 04:10.560
- GARY...

04:10.560 --> 04:12.390
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU.

04:15.610 --> 04:20.820
*

04:20.820 --> 04:22.360
INCREDIBLE.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.360
I SPENT MY WHOLE SCHOOL CAREER
TRYING TO DITCH CLASS,

04:24.360 --> 04:27.370
AND THEY PUNISH ME BY GIVING ME
AN EARLY RETIREMENT.

04:27.370 --> 04:29.830
RIGHT NOW MR. TRUMAN
IS ABOUT TO CALL MY MOM

04:29.830 --> 04:31.750
TO LET HER KNOW
ABOUT MY EXPULSION.

04:35.420 --> 04:38.340
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

04:38.340 --> 04:39.630
[alarm wailing]

04:39.630 --> 04:41.130
- OH! OH!

04:43.680 --> 04:46.850
- ON AVERAGE, AN EASTWOOD HIGH
FIRE DRILLS TAKE 11 MINUTES.

04:46.850 --> 04:49.680
I ONLY NEED 10.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.140
- YO, FELIX!

04:53.140 --> 04:55.150
- DANNY BOY.
WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

04:55.150 --> 04:56.610
- YOU PULLED
THE FIRE ALARM AGAIN?

04:56.610 --> 04:58.650
- OF COURSE. DID I GET YOU OUT
OF THAT TRIG TEST?

04:58.650 --> 05:00.070
- YOU GOT ME OUT
OF THE TRIG TEST.

05:00.070 --> 05:01.990
- TIMED IT PERFECTLY.
- YEAH.

05:01.990 --> 05:03.570
YO, I HEARD YOU GOT SUSPENDED.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.200
- NOPE, EXPELLED.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.780
- WHOA, WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

05:06.780 --> 05:08.160
- DUDE, YOUR PARENTS
ARE GONNA KILL YOU.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.660
- ONLY IF THEY FIND OUT,
AND THEY WON'T.

05:10.660 --> 05:13.210
- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?
- WE'LL TALK SOON.

05:13.210 --> 05:15.830
I GOT A TAKE AN IMPORTANT CALL
IN EIGHT AND A HALF MINUTES.

05:15.830 --> 05:18.380
- YOU'RE INSANE!

05:28.640 --> 05:29.970
- I PROGRAMMED MY MOM'S PHONE

05:29.970 --> 05:31.970
TO FORWARD HER CALLS
TO MY SKYPE ACCOUNT.

05:31.970 --> 05:34.270
WHEN MR. TRUMAN CALLS,
I'LL JUST--

05:34.270 --> 05:35.850
[computer ringing]

05:35.850 --> 05:38.360
EXCUSE ME.
I GOT TO TAKE THIS.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.570
[imitating woman's voice]
HELLO?

05:43.570 --> 05:45.150
EXPELLED?

05:45.150 --> 05:46.910
- EXPELLED, MRS. O'NEIL.

05:46.910 --> 05:48.870
WE HAVE A THREE-STRIKE POLICY
HERE AT EASTWOOD,

05:48.870 --> 05:50.830
AND THAT WAS HIS THIRD STRIKE.

05:50.830 --> 05:55.370
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH HIM?

05:55.370 --> 05:56.790
- WHO, ME?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.380
- NO, NOT YOU.

05:58.380 --> 05:59.790
BEN.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.670
- WHAT HAPPENED?
I THOUGHT HE WAS IMPROVING.

06:01.670 --> 06:03.460
- HIS GRADES ARE GETTING WORSE.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.550
- LAST YEAR, MY BROTHER, BEN,
FORGED A REPORT CARD.

06:06.550 --> 06:08.260
WHEN MY PARENTS FOUND OUT,
THEY SENT HIM

06:08.260 --> 06:10.430
TO THE MOUNTAIN
DISCIPLINARY ACADEMY.

06:10.430 --> 06:12.760
LOCATED IN THE FOOT HILLS
OF MONTANA,

06:12.760 --> 06:14.930
IT'S MORE OF A JAIL
THAN A SCHOOL.

06:14.930 --> 06:16.560
THERE'S BAR ON WINDOWS,

06:16.560 --> 06:18.060
WARDENS INSTEAD OF TEACHERS.

06:18.060 --> 06:21.770
[whispering]
I HEARD IT SMELLS LIKE BUTTHOLE.

06:21.770 --> 06:24.820
- HE GOT A 1.7 GPA.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.990
UNBELIEVABLE.

06:26.990 --> 06:29.240
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, FELIX?
HOW ARE THINGS AT SCHOOL?

06:29.240 --> 06:31.740
- THINGS ARE GREAT.
I ACED MY TRIG TEST.

06:31.740 --> 06:32.830
- THERE YOU GO.

06:32.830 --> 06:34.660
- WOW.
GREAT JOB, KIDDO.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.330
- YEP.
STUDIED FOR IT ALL WEEK.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.210
- I LIKE TO HEAR THAT.
- YES.

06:38.210 --> 06:41.750
- DIANE SAYS THE REPORT CARDS
ARE COMING OUT IN A FEW DAYS.

06:41.750 --> 06:46.630
- MM, AND WHAT KIND OF GRADES
CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE?

06:46.630 --> 06:48.470
- LOTS OF "A"s.

06:48.470 --> 06:51.550
- AW.

06:51.550 --> 06:54.470
- LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA NEED
A NEW REPORT CARD.

06:54.470 --> 06:57.100
[school bell ringing]

06:59.980 --> 07:02.190
GETTING A DECENT REPORT CARD
HERE AT EASTWOOD

07:02.190 --> 07:03.730
IS PRETTY DIFFICULT...

07:03.730 --> 07:06.530
SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN EXPELLED.

07:06.530 --> 07:07.780
THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN PEOPLE

07:07.780 --> 07:09.610
WITH THE POWER TO PRINT
A REPORT CARD.

07:09.610 --> 07:11.740
JUST ONE OF THEM IS A STUDENT.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.200
SHE'S MR. TRUMAN'S T.A.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.790
SHE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
MY BITTER EX-GIRLFRIEND.

07:17.950 --> 07:20.080
- SOMEONE'S COMING.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.130
- [sighs] I DO NOT HAVE TIME
TO TALK TO YOU.

07:22.130 --> 07:23.790
- YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
WHAT I WANT TALK ABOUT.

07:23.790 --> 07:26.840
- NOW WE'VE ALREADY TALKED
MORE THAN I WANTED.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.090
- I NEED A REPORT CARD.

07:28.090 --> 07:30.720
- THEN I SUGGEST
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL,

07:30.720 --> 07:32.590
PREFERABLY
SOMEWHERE FAR FROM HERE.

07:32.590 --> 07:33.800
- OUCH.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.600
OR YOU COULD JUST PRINT ONE
FOR ME.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.720
- [scoffs]
NO.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.310
- UM, WEREN'T YOU EXPELLED?

07:40.310 --> 07:42.600
- UM, YEAH.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.310
- CAN YOU PLEASE GO?

07:44.310 --> 07:47.360
- ANY REASON YOU KEEP COVERING
STACY'S ANTI-BULLYING POSTINGS?

07:47.360 --> 07:49.990
- I WANT TO WIN.
- I CAN HELP WITH THAT.

07:49.990 --> 07:52.110
- [scoffs]
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:52.110 --> 07:53.870
- OH, COME ON.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.330
WE BOTH KNOW I CAN.

07:55.330 --> 07:58.040
- VANESSA, DON'T.
HE'S TROUBLE.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.790
- CAN YOU FINISH THIS FOR ME?

08:00.790 --> 08:03.500
- [sighs]
SURE.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.880
- BYE.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.340
[school bell ringing]

08:08.340 --> 08:11.760
- SO STACY'S FAVORED
TO WIN THIS THING.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.840
- [chuckles]
YEAH, I FIGURED.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.180
- SO HOW DO I BEAT HER?

08:15.180 --> 08:17.560
- OH, IT'S ACTUALLY
REALLY SIMPLE.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.180
JUST HAND OUT
CUTE LITTLE MARSHMALLOWS

08:19.180 --> 08:21.390
WITH YOUR NAME ON THEM.
- DO I NEED TO SLAP YOU?

08:21.390 --> 08:22.440
- HEY, GUYS?

08:22.440 --> 08:24.230
COULD YOU POSSIBLY GET
OFF THE STAIRS?

08:24.230 --> 08:25.650
YOU'RE IN THE SHOT.

08:25.650 --> 08:28.360
- IT BLOWS MY MIND THAT PEOPLE
LIKE HER SO MUCH.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.190
- HEY, HEY, COME OVER HERE.

08:30.190 --> 08:32.490
I'LL INTERVIEW YOU
FOR MY BULLYING SEGMENT.

08:32.490 --> 08:34.200
- I WANT YOU TO END HER.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.909
- THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

08:35.909 --> 08:37.370
CAN YOU GET ME MY REPORT CARD?

08:37.370 --> 08:39.580
- YES, I CAN GET YOU
A REPORT CARD.

08:39.580 --> 08:42.710
- GREAT. I'LL TAKE
STRAIGHT "A"s, PLEASE.

08:42.710 --> 08:44.920
- DO YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST CLUE
AS TO HOW MUCH WORK

08:44.920 --> 08:46.840
GOES INTO GETTING
STRAIGHT "A"s?

08:46.840 --> 08:48.420
- MM...DON'T CARE.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.000
I'LL TAKE STRAIGHT "A"s, PLEASE.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.550
- DONE.
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

08:52.550 --> 08:54.760
- ALL IT TAKES
IS A SINGLE TWEET.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.260
- ROXY?

08:56.260 --> 08:57.510
- ROXY.

08:57.510 --> 08:59.560
MEET ROXY.

08:59.560 --> 09:03.640
ROXY IS INFAMOUS FOR RUINING
THE LIVES OF STUDENTS

09:03.640 --> 09:05.100
WITH VICIOUS RUMORS.

09:05.100 --> 09:08.060
I AM NO EXCEPTION.

09:08.060 --> 09:11.320
"LEAVE IT TO FELIX O'NEIL
TO CREEP ON THE GIRL'S BATHROOM

09:11.320 --> 09:12.740
"THROUGH A HOLE ON THE CEILING.

09:12.740 --> 09:15.610
#PEEPINGTOM."

09:15.610 --> 09:18.240
IT ALL HAPPENED WHEN VANESSA
AND I WERE DATING FRESHMAN YEAR.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.660
AFTER SCHOOL, I TRIED
TO BREAK INTO THE LIBRARY

09:20.660 --> 09:23.830
TO BORROW A NEW P.C.

09:23.830 --> 09:27.000
[roof creaking]
AAH!

09:28.290 --> 09:30.420
THIS ISN'T THE BOYS' BATHROOM.

09:30.420 --> 09:31.920
- [screaming]

09:31.920 --> 09:34.130
- A SINGLE TWEET
CAUSED THE BITTER END

09:34.130 --> 09:38.850
OF MY SWEET, SWEET RELATIONSHIP
WITH VANESSA.

09:55.780 --> 09:57.160
DANNY!
- [shouts]

09:57.160 --> 09:59.370
- [laughing]
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:59.370 --> 10:01.660
- I NEED HELP WITH SOMETHING.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.200
- SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,

10:03.200 --> 10:04.910
WHERE THE HELL
DID YOU JUST COME FROM?

10:04.910 --> 10:06.120
- THE WINDOW.

10:06.120 --> 10:09.080
- YOU SCARED ME HALF
TO DEATH, MAN.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.170
OH!
- I APOLOGIZE.

10:11.170 --> 10:13.460
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
HACK INTO ROXY.

10:13.460 --> 10:15.340
- [chuckles] AND I NEED YOU
TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

10:15.340 --> 10:16.930
HOW'S THAT?
COOL.

10:16.930 --> 10:18.890
- IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?

10:18.890 --> 10:22.060
- UH, YEAH, THERE IS A PROBLEM.

10:22.060 --> 10:23.560
I DON'T LIKE HACKING
INTO THINGS

10:23.560 --> 10:26.350
THAT CAN TWEET MY SOCIAL LIFE
OUT OF EXISTENCE.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.020
- NO. YEAH, YEAH,
BUT THAT'S THE THING.

10:28.020 --> 10:31.860
IF WE HAD ROXY'S PASSWORD,
WE COULD CONTROL THE TWEETS.

10:31.860 --> 10:34.230
- GO ON.

10:34.230 --> 10:37.900
- WE COULD DELETE THEM OR...

10:37.900 --> 10:40.280
POST THEM.

10:40.280 --> 10:43.660
- WE CAN POST THEM?

10:43.660 --> 10:46.450
I MEAN, I GUESS IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO JUST GET THE PASSWORD.

10:46.450 --> 10:48.870
- YES, EXACTLY!
DO YOUR THING, MAN.

10:48.870 --> 10:50.750
DO YOUR THING.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.750
[dramatic music]

10:53.750 --> 11:01.680
*

11:11.810 --> 11:13.400
HOW'S IT COMING?

11:15.320 --> 11:17.490
- YOU MAY WANT TO SIT DOWN
FOR THIS.

11:19.070 --> 11:21.320
PASSWORD ACQUIRED.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.530
AND I ALSO FOUND
ROXY'S I.P. ADDRESS.

11:23.530 --> 11:25.290
- YOU GOT THE I.P. ADDRESS?
HOW?

11:25.290 --> 11:26.620
- WORKED A LITTLE BIT
OF MY MAGIC

11:26.620 --> 11:28.080
AND FOUND A BACK DOOR
INTO TWITTER.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.330
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
- NOPE.

11:29.330 --> 11:32.540
NEARLY POOPED MY PANTS
FROM EXCITEMENT.

11:32.540 --> 11:35.000
I KNOW ROXY'S TRUE IDENTITY.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.420
- SHUT UP AND SHOW ME.

11:40.170 --> 11:42.430
HOLY...

11:42.430 --> 11:44.390
CRAP.

11:44.390 --> 11:48.560
- I HEARD IT SAID THAT BULLYING
CREATES BULLIES--

11:48.560 --> 11:50.350
A VICIOUS CYCLE
THAT WILL CONTINUE

11:50.350 --> 11:53.100
UNTIL SOMEONE MAKES A STAND
AGAINST IT.

11:53.100 --> 11:56.190
I AM HERE TO MAKE THAT STAND.

11:56.190 --> 11:57.730
WHEN YOU VOTE TODAY,

11:57.730 --> 12:01.570
REMEMBER I AM HERE TO MAKE
EASTWOOD HIGH BULLY-FREE.

12:01.570 --> 12:02.950
[applause]

12:02.950 --> 12:04.820
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.410
VOTE STACY.

12:06.410 --> 12:08.330
- THESE PEOPLE
NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

12:08.330 --> 12:09.620
- WE NEED TO EXPOSE HER.

12:09.620 --> 12:11.620
- LET'S JUST BEAT HER TO DEATH.

12:11.620 --> 12:13.460
- SHE'LL LOSE THE RACE
IF SHE IS EXPOSED.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.290
- SHE'LL LOSE THE RACE
IF WE BEAT HER TO DEATH.

12:15.290 --> 12:18.050
- VANESSA, WOULD YOU RELAX
A LITTLE BIT?

12:18.050 --> 12:20.090
- FINE.
HOW DO WE EXPOSE HER?

12:20.090 --> 12:22.180
- WITH THIS.

12:22.180 --> 12:24.760
- WE PUT A VIDEO ON THERE
WITH ALL OF THE INFORMATION

12:24.760 --> 12:26.760
LINKING STACY TO ROXY.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.850
- WE'RE GONNA PATCH
INTO THE SCHOOL'S TV SYSTEM.

12:28.850 --> 12:31.270
THEN WE'RE GONNA BROADCAST IT
LIVE TO THE ENTIRE SCHOOL

12:31.270 --> 12:32.850
DURING THE VIDEO ANNOUNCEMENTS.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.730
- EXCUSE ME.

12:34.730 --> 12:36.770
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:36.770 --> 12:37.980
- HI, GARY.

12:37.980 --> 12:39.940
- WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO GET THROUGH TO YOU?

12:39.940 --> 12:41.320
DO I NEED TO CALL THE POLICE?

12:41.320 --> 12:42.990
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'LL BE NECESSARY.

12:42.990 --> 12:45.160
- WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
TO DO WITH THIS, HUH?

12:45.160 --> 12:46.490
- UH, THAT'S JUST
A SCHOOL PROJECT

12:46.490 --> 12:47.700
THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.290
- YEAH, ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR PRANKS?

12:49.290 --> 12:52.080
- NO, I JUST--
- LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.210
IF I SEE YOU
ON MY CAMPUS AGAIN,

12:54.210 --> 12:55.500
I'LL HAVE YOU IN HANDCUFFS

12:55.500 --> 12:58.750
IN FRONT OF ALL
YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.260

13:08.300 --> 13:09.970
- SURE.
- LEAVE...

13:09.970 --> 13:11.890
NOW.

13:14.690 --> 13:18.150
- WE NEED ANOTHER COPY OF THAT
VIDEO BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENTS.

13:18.150 --> 13:19.650
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

13:19.650 --> 13:22.280
IT WOULD TAKE HOURS TO RUN HOME
AND RENDER A NEW ONE.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.610
THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME.

13:23.610 --> 13:26.070
- BUT THE STUDENT BODY
VOTES TODAY.

13:26.070 --> 13:27.320
- YEAH.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.530
I THINK YOU'RE BONED.

13:29.530 --> 13:31.290
- AND THAT SOLVES THE MYSTERY

13:31.290 --> 13:32.830
OF OUR FAULTY
FIRE-ALARM SYSTEM.

13:32.830 --> 13:36.330
UP NEXT, AN ANTI-BULLYING
SEGMENT FROM STACY RICHARDS.

13:36.330 --> 13:38.130
- AT EASTWOOD HIGH
THERE IS ONE BULLY

13:38.130 --> 13:41.460
THAT HAS CAUSED MORE TORMENT
THAN ANY OTHER--ROXY.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.550
IF I'M ELECTED,
I WILL STOP AT NOTHING

13:43.550 --> 13:45.930
TO BRING ROXY TO JUSTICE.

13:45.930 --> 13:47.930
- I CAN HELP WITH THAT.

13:47.930 --> 13:49.890
GOOD MORNING, EASTWOOD HIGH.

13:49.890 --> 13:52.470
IT IS MY GENUINE PLEASURE
TO REVEAL THE TRUE IDENTITY

13:52.470 --> 13:54.680
OF THE ANONYMOUS CYBER BULLY,
KNOWN AS...

13:54.680 --> 13:56.190
ROXY.

13:56.190 --> 13:58.650
- [whispering] HE MUST'VE
PATCHED INTO THE SYSTEM.

13:58.650 --> 14:00.400
- [whispering]
BUT HOW DID HE GET ON TV?

14:00.400 --> 14:02.190
- HE'S DOING IT LIVE.

14:02.190 --> 14:05.360
- AND BASICALLY,
I'M GONNA SCREW HER.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.610
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
- SHH.

14:07.610 --> 14:10.450
- BEHIND ME
IS ROXY'S I.P. ADDRESS,

14:10.450 --> 14:12.330
WHICH I ACQUIRED
BY A BRUTE-FORCE HACKING

14:12.330 --> 14:13.750
OF THE TWITTER ACCOUNT.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.580
IF STACY RICHARDS
IS TRULY SEARCHING FOR ROXY,

14:15.580 --> 14:17.710
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO SEARCH
VERY FAR.

14:17.710 --> 14:21.710
- HE'S IN
THE CHEERLEADERS' CLOSET.

14:21.710 --> 14:24.550
- THIS IS STACY RICHARDS'
I.P. ADDRESS--

14:24.550 --> 14:27.260
A PERFECT MATCH
WITH THE ONE ASSOCIATED WITH...

14:27.260 --> 14:28.760
ROXY!

14:28.760 --> 14:31.720
[all murmuring]

14:34.770 --> 14:36.390

15:05.000 --> 15:06.380
- SO HERE IT IS, FOLKS--

15:06.380 --> 15:09.550
STRAIGHT "A"s,
COURTESY OF MY GIRL VANESSA.

15:12.220 --> 15:15.600
- WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

15:15.600 --> 15:17.850
ARE THOSE YOUR GRADES?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.690
- UH...

15:19.690 --> 15:22.270
NOPE, IT'S
VANESSA'S DEATH CERTIFICATE.

15:22.270 --> 15:23.560
- FELIX.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.270
ARE THOSE YOUR GRADES?

15:31.110 --> 15:32.450
HEY!

15:32.450 --> 15:35.030
HEY, MISTER, YOU JUST
DON'T TAKE OFF.

15:35.030 --> 15:37.620
- I PROBABLY COULD'VE HANDLED
THAT BETTER,

15:37.620 --> 15:39.080
BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN,

15:39.080 --> 15:41.460
MY PARENTS MUST NEVER SEE
THAT REPORT CARD,

15:41.460 --> 15:42.880
FOR IF THEY DO,

15:42.880 --> 15:46.300
THEY'LL SIMULTANEOUSLY CRAP
THEIR PANTS.

15:46.300 --> 15:50.050
[rock music]

15:50.050 --> 15:51.470
- OH!

15:51.470 --> 15:53.300
- MOST PARENTS WOULD CONSIDER
DISOWNING YOU

15:53.300 --> 15:54.600
FOR AN "F"
ON YOUR REPORT CARD.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.600
SEVEN "F"s
IS A DIFFERENT STORY.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.020
THAT RIGHT THERE
IS A DEATH SENTENCE.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.650
WHAT IS THIS?

16:10.650 --> 16:12.660
- IT'S YOUR REPORT CARD, SILLY.
- FUNNY.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.990
I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER ASKING
FOR STRAIGHT "A"s.

16:14.990 --> 16:16.410
THOSE APPEAR TO BE "F"s.

16:16.410 --> 16:19.330
- HMM, LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
THE REPORT CARD YOU DESERVE.

16:19.330 --> 16:20.960
- THIS IS WHAT I DESERVE
FOR HELPING YOU?

16:20.960 --> 16:23.040
- YOU'VE NEVER WORKED
FOR ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE,

16:23.040 --> 16:23.880
HAVE YOU, FELIX?

16:23.880 --> 16:25.540
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:25.540 --> 16:28.210
- YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO WALK OUT
OF HERE IN THE TOP PERCENTILE

16:28.210 --> 16:29.760
WITHOUT EVER APPLYING YOURSELF.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.920
I'M NOT GONNA HELP YOU CHEAT
YOUR WAY TO THE TOP.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.180
- ARE YOU INSANE?

16:33.180 --> 16:35.220
I HELPED YOU CHEAT YOUR WAY
INTO THE PRESIDENCY.

16:35.220 --> 16:36.850
- I EARNED THAT PRESIDENCY.

16:36.850 --> 16:39.520
I'VE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS IT
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.310
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD I WORKED?

16:41.310 --> 16:44.480
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU FIVE
MINUTES TO FIX MY REPORT CARD.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.230
FIX IT!
- OR WHAT?

16:48.230 --> 16:49.690
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF I DON'T?

16:49.690 --> 16:51.860
- USE YOUR IMAGINATION.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.950
- TWO MINUTES TO CURTAIN.

16:55.410 --> 16:57.030
- SO HOW DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY THIS?

16:57.030 --> 16:59.660
- EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE A PLAY TO STAR IN,

16:59.660 --> 17:01.330
BUT GOOD LUCK
WITH THE REPORT CARD.

17:01.330 --> 17:04.420
I'M SURE YOUR PARENTS
WILL BE REALLY PROUD.

SHE'S A RARE BREED,

17:15.430 --> 17:17.050

I'M IN IT.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.460
THAT'S WHY YOU RAN OFF
LIKE YOU DID BEFORE?

26:44.330 --> 26:46.580
YOU WANT TO DESTROY
THE SCHOOL'S SECURITY CAMERA

26:46.580 --> 26:49.790
WITH SUPER STRING
- "SUPER STRING"?

26:49.790 --> 26:51.500
WHO CALLS IT THAT?

26:51.500 --> 26:54.090
- I DON'T--WHATEVER IT'S CALLED,
WE'RE NOT USING IT.

26:54.090 --> 26:56.420
- FINE. WOULD YOU RATHER USE
SPRAY PAINT?

26:56.420 --> 27:01.300

- I'M FAILING...

27:27.910 --> 27:29.830
SO IS HALF OF THE ENTIRE CLASS.

27:29.830 --> 27:32.170
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO CHANGE
YOUR GRADE, THEN.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.340
- WHO ARE WE GONNA GET
THE SECURITY CODE FROM?

27:37.340 --> 27:40.840
- I HEAR THE ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN
HAS IT.

27:40.840 --> 27:44.180
- WHO IS
THE ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN?

27:44.180 --> 27:47.100
- STACY RICHARDS...

27:47.100 --> 27:48.480
OR SHOULD I SAY "ROXY"?

27:48.480 --> 27:49.890
- YOU CAN'T BE HERE.
YOU'RE EXPELLED.

27:49.890 --> 27:52.520
- AND YOU'RE SUSPENDED,
SO THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.860
- I'M STILL ALLOWED
TO PARTICIPATE

27:54.860 --> 27:56.190

28:34.770 --> 28:36.940
AND THE CODE
FOR THE ALARM SYSTEM, PLEASE.

- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I HAVE
EITHER OF THOSE THINGS?

28:40.070 --> 28:41.740
- BECAUSE THOSE THINGS
ARE NECESSARY

THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO HACK THE GRADING SYSTEM

FROM THE OUTSIDE.

TO TRUMAN'S COMPUTER,

29:19.110 --> 29:21.610
AND FOR THAT,
WE WILL NEED ONE KEY

29:21.610 --> 29:25.570

WHICH IS...?

I'M WEARING BLACK STUFF,
B-BURGLARY STUFF.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.200
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.530
- WHY CAN I NOT DO THAT?

HOLD UP, HOLD UP, HOLD UP .

31:21.560 --> 31:23.610
CAN WE--CAN WE THINK ABOUT THIS
FOR JUST A SPLIT SECOND?

31:23.610 --> 31:26.900
LIKE, WE'RE ABOUT TO COMMIT
A-A LEGIT CRIME RIGHT NOW.

31:26.900 --> 31:31.450
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY
OF THE SITUATION AT ALL?

31:31.450 --> 31:33.910
OKAY, I TAKE THAT AS A NO.

35:28.390 --> 35:30.150
- [chuckles]
REALLY?

35:30.150 --> 35:32.520
- YEAH. WHAT, YOU DON'T WANT
STRAIGHT "A"s?

35:32.520 --> 35:34.480
- ALL RIGHT.
DO IT.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.650
4.0 IT IS.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.950
[printer whirring]

35:43.950 --> 35:48.330
THERE IT IS--
STRAIGHT "A"s, BABY.

35:48.330 --> 35:49.580
- CRAP, I GOT TO PUT THIS BACK.

35:49.580 --> 35:50.870
- OH, NO WAY, MAN.

35:50.870 --> 35:52.130
IT'S MINE NOW.

35:52.130 --> 35:54.380
- I GOT TO PUT IT BACK
ON HIS DESK.

35:54.380 --> 35:56.760
HE'S GONNA KNOW WE WERE HERE.

36:09.850 --> 36:11.310
- WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE, FELIX?

36:11.310 --> 36:12.850
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
MR. TRUMAN?

36:12.850 --> 36:14.190
IT'S 2:00 IN THE MORNING.

36:14.190 --> 36:16.610
- UH-HUH. WAITING FOR THE POLICE
TO ARRIVE.

36:18.110 --> 36:21.700
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE THIS TIME--
STEALING COMPUTERS AGAIN?

36:21.700 --> 36:24.280
- I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO
BREAK YOUR WINDOW, MR. TRUMAN.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.240
- IF YOU THINK THAT'LL HELP,
SON, KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

36:27.240 --> 36:28.950
[siren wails]

36:32.750 --> 36:36.130
[car doors open, close]

36:45.850 --> 36:47.930
WHAT DO YOU WANT, FELIX?

36:47.930 --> 36:50.100
- IF YOU COULD LET ME GO,
THAT'D BE GREAT.

36:50.100 --> 36:54.770
- NO, NO, NO. I MEAN, WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU WANT, HUH?

36:54.770 --> 36:57.320
WHAT KIND A FUTURE DO YOU SEE
FOR YOURSELF?

36:59.740 --> 37:02.950
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT IT?

37:02.950 --> 37:06.580
- I KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT.

37:06.580 --> 37:10.200
I DON'T WANT A SEAT BEHIND
A DESK FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS...

37:10.200 --> 37:14.750
SO I CAN GET A JOB AND SIT
BEHIND A DESK FOR THE NEXT 40.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.590
I'M TRYING TO LIVE...

37:16.590 --> 37:19.380
EVERY SECOND OF MY LIFE
TO THE FULLEST.

37:19.380 --> 37:21.090
AND...

37:21.090 --> 37:24.380
YOU'RE MAKING THAT
REALLY DIFFICULT, MR. TRUMAN.

37:24.380 --> 37:29.100
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

37:29.100 --> 37:31.680
[knock at door]
- POLICE, OPEN UP!

37:35.770 --> 37:37.020
- HE'S OVER HERE, OFFICER.

37:37.020 --> 37:39.940
- PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

37:58.130 --> 38:00.420
- [scoffs]

38:00.420 --> 38:02.920
VERY RARELY DO I SAY THIS,

38:02.920 --> 38:07.840
BUT I AM, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
100% BONED THIS TIME.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.850
[chuckles]

38:09.850 --> 38:11.520
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

38:11.520 --> 38:15.230
MONTANA CAN'T BE MUCH WORSE
THAN THIS.

38:15.230 --> 38:18.650
THIS COULD BE DIFFICULT
TO EXPLAIN TO MY PARENTS.

38:19.440 --> 38:21.070
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

38:25.320 --> 38:27.570
I NEVER PLANNED TO END UP
LIKE MY BROTHER.

38:27.570 --> 38:29.910
[door buzzes, opens]

38:29.910 --> 38:32.830
- YOUR DAD'S HERE
TO PICK YOU UP.

38:32.830 --> 38:34.750
- EXCELLENT.

38:36.670 --> 38:39.170
- COME ON OUT.

38:43.710 --> 38:46.050
- HEY, THERE, SON.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.680
- MR. O'NEIL?

38:51.680 --> 38:55.350
- DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE
A MOIST TOWELETTE, BY CHANCE?

38:55.350 --> 38:57.440
- YOUR SON'S
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

38:57.440 --> 38:58.730
- WHAT?

38:58.730 --> 39:00.690
FELIX, I AM DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, SON!

39:00.690 --> 39:02.520
SUPER, SUPER DISAPPOINTED!

39:02.520 --> 39:05.860
- I'M SO SORRY, DAD.

39:07.110 --> 39:09.740
- READY, SON?
- YEP.

39:09.740 --> 39:12.580
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.
SEE YOU.

39:12.580 --> 39:15.830
[chuckles]

39:17.040 --> 39:19.080
- YOU KNOW,
I WAS EXPECTING YOU

39:19.080 --> 39:21.670
TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE
UPSET, DAD.

39:21.670 --> 39:23.170
OR CAN I CALL YOU "BEN" NOW?

39:25.880 --> 39:27.920
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,
LITTLE BRO.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.380
- SERIOUSLY.

39:29.380 --> 39:31.550
I MISSED YOU, MAN.
- I MISSED YOU TOO.

39:31.550 --> 39:33.050
HOW DID YOU KNOW IS ME?

39:33.050 --> 39:34.930
- I MEAN, IT WASN'T HARD
TO RECOGNIZE YOU,

39:34.930 --> 39:37.770
EVEN WITH THAT LITTLE
CREEP-STACHE.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.230
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
THAT WOULD WORK?

39:39.230 --> 39:41.730
- IT DID WORK,
AND YOU'RE WELCOME.

39:41.730 --> 39:45.940
- SORRY, I JUST--I JUST
CAN'T BELIEVE HE BOUGHT IT.

39:45.940 --> 39:47.820
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
ANYWAY?

39:47.820 --> 39:50.990
- WELL, THAT ONE IS KIND OF HARD
TO EXPLAIN.

39:50.990 --> 39:52.370
I HAVEN'T REALLY TOLD MOM
AND DAD YET

39:52.370 --> 39:55.490
ABOUT THE WHOLE
"GREAT ESCAPE" THING, SO...

39:57.950 --> 39:59.920
- YOU OKAY THERE?
- YEAH.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.250
- I KNOW A SHORTCUT.

40:04.540 --> 40:06.550
- MY BROTHER'S A DIFFERENT CLASS
OF TROUBLEMAKER.

40:06.550 --> 40:08.920
HE'S BEEN CAUGHT MORE TIMES
THAN I CAN COUNT,

40:08.920 --> 40:12.840
BUT HE ALWAYS MANAGES
TO POWER THROUGH.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.220
HE'S A VETERAN RULE-BREAKER.

40:15.220 --> 40:16.770
ME?

40:16.770 --> 40:18.930
I PREFER
A MORE SUBTLE APPROACH.

40:18.930 --> 40:20.520
- OH, YEAH.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.560
MM.
- COME ON.

40:22.560 --> 40:26.020
[both laugh]

40:26.020 --> 40:27.570
- I GOT TO SAY--

40:27.570 --> 40:30.950
YOU DEFINITELY SAVE MY ASS
FROM THE MOUNTAIN ACADEMY.

40:30.950 --> 40:33.700
- YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO THERE.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.080
- SO...

40:35.080 --> 40:36.950
HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?

40:36.950 --> 40:39.500
ISN'T THAT PLACE,
LIKE, MAXIMUM SECURITY?

40:39.500 --> 40:42.670
- TO BE HONEST,
IT WAS PRETTY EASY.

40:42.670 --> 40:44.960
- HOW?

40:44.960 --> 40:47.250
- I SHIPPED MYSELF OUT.

40:48.630 --> 40:52.300
LAST SEMESTER I GOT A JOB
IN THE MAIL ROOM.

40:52.300 --> 40:54.760
EVERY MONDAY I WOULD SORT
THROUGH EVERYBODY'S LETTERS

40:54.760 --> 40:57.140
FROM A GIANT SACK.

40:57.140 --> 41:00.020
THE OTHER KIDS STARTING
CALLING ME "SACK BOY."

41:00.020 --> 41:03.980
[chuckles]
BUT I HAD THE LAST LAUGH.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.490
I WAS SUPPOSED TO SHIP BACK
A BROKEN TANDEM BIKE

41:18.490 --> 41:20.120
FROM OUR FITNESS CLASS.

41:20.120 --> 41:24.120
BUT THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH SPACE
FOR ME TO CRAWL INSIDE.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.670
SO I HOPPED IN THE BOX

41:25.670 --> 41:28.170
AND I SHIPPED MYSELF TO FREEDOM.

41:28.170 --> 41:30.010
- WAIT.
SERIOUSLY?

41:30.010 --> 41:31.460
HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO BREATHE?

41:31.460 --> 41:33.550
- THERE WAS PLENTY OF OXYGEN,
AS I RECALL.

41:33.550 --> 41:36.510
THE BOX WAS SHIPPED GROUND.
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

41:36.510 --> 41:38.680
- SO YOU JUST CHANGED
THE ADDRESS ON THE BOX?

41:38.680 --> 41:41.390
- SHIPPED MYSELF
RIGHT TO OUR DOORSTEP, BABY.

41:41.390 --> 41:43.850
- THE CRATE--
YOU WERE IN THAT CRATE.

41:43.850 --> 41:46.230
- YES, DUDE, YOU WALKED
RIGHT PASS ME.

41:46.230 --> 41:47.190
- OH.

41:52.070 --> 41:54.110
- STRETCHING MY LEGS WAS...

41:54.110 --> 41:58.030
BORDERLINE ORGASMIC.

41:58.030 --> 42:01.370
SNEAKING INTO THE HOUSE
WAS EASY.

42:01.370 --> 42:05.460
FINDING A PERMANENT HIDING SPOT
WAS EVEN EASIER.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.210
I QUICKLY DISCOVERED
THAT THE ATTIC

42:10.210 --> 42:12.380
IS THE MOST BADASS PART
OF THE HOUSE.

42:12.380 --> 42:14.800
MY OLD BOX OF TOYS
WAS UP THERE.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.550
SO WAS SANTA CLAUS.

42:16.550 --> 42:20.140
IT WAS A LITTLE CRAMPED,
BUT I MADE DO WITH WHAT I HAD.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.060
FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS,
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN THE ATTIC,

42:25.060 --> 42:27.520
OFF OF HOT DOGS AND CANDY.

42:29.900 --> 42:33.070
[telephone ringing]

42:36.990 --> 42:40.910
[telephone continues ringing]

42:42.290 --> 42:43.160
HELLO?

42:43.160 --> 42:44.660
WHEN I HEARD YOU WERE ARRESTED,

42:44.660 --> 42:46.540
I IMMEDIATELY KNEW
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE.

42:46.540 --> 42:49.460
OH, YES.
THIS IS CERTAINLY HIM.

42:49.460 --> 42:51.670
- WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU
TO PICK HIM UP AT THE STATION.

42:51.670 --> 42:54.340
- ABSOLUTELY. I'LL BE RIGHT
THERE TO PICK HIM UP,

42:54.340 --> 42:57.260
'CAUSE I'M HIS DAD.

42:57.260 --> 43:01.930
- I MEAN THIS
IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY,

43:01.930 --> 43:04.560
BUT YOU ARE INSANE.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.520
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH, MAN.

43:06.520 --> 43:09.060
- OF COURSE, DUDE.
I GOT YOU.

43:09.060 --> 43:10.440
- YOU DO KNOW

43:10.440 --> 43:13.400
THAT WE ARE ABOUT FIVE MILES
FROM THE HOUSE.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.490
ARE WE WALKING THE WHOLE WAY?

43:15.490 --> 43:17.110
- NOPE.

43:21.490 --> 43:23.450
I FIXED IT...

43:24.870 --> 43:26.620
SORT OF.

43:26.620 --> 43:30.290
- DUDE, WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THIS BIKE?

43:30.290 --> 43:32.040
- A LOT OF THINGS.

43:38.840 --> 43:42.100
SORRY.

43:42.100 --> 43:44.260
OKAY, NICE AND EASY.

43:51.190 --> 43:52.770
- [whispering]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

43:52.770 --> 43:54.650
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YOU CAN'T USE THE FRONT DOOR,

43:54.650 --> 43:57.820
THE ALARM SYSTEM
ACTIVATES AFTER 10:00.

43:57.820 --> 44:00.490
GET IT TOGETHER, MAN.

44:00.490 --> 44:02.410
- OKAY.

44:02.410 --> 44:04.370
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

44:04.370 --> 44:06.660
- I'M GONNA SNEAK
THROUGH MY BEDROOM WINDOW.

44:06.660 --> 44:07.830
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

44:07.830 --> 44:09.500
IT'S RIGHT NEXT
TO MOM AND DAD'S ROOM.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.620
THEY'RE GONNA HEAR YOU
WHEN YOU GO ON THE ROOF.

44:11.620 --> 44:12.630
- OKAY.

44:12.630 --> 44:14.750
SO HOW DO YOU SUGGEST
THAT WE GET IN?

44:14.750 --> 44:18.720
- THE LIVING-ROOM WINDOW.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.220
THAT'S A ROOKIE MOVE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

44:20.220 --> 44:21.510
THAT WINDOW SQUEAKS.

44:21.510 --> 44:24.010
- I HAVE DONE THIS
A THOUSAND TIMES, FELIX.

44:24.010 --> 44:26.560
- SO HAVE I.
- ALL RIGHT, YOU DON'T GET IT.

44:26.560 --> 44:28.680
IT'S MY PATOOTIE
IF WE GET CAUGHT.

44:28.680 --> 44:31.350
MOM AND DAD ARE GONNA SEND ME
RIGHT BACK TO MONTANA.

44:31.350 --> 44:33.190
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

44:33.190 --> 44:34.560
EXECUTIVE DECISION--

44:34.560 --> 44:36.860
WE'RE GOING THROUGH
THE LIVING-ROOM WINDOW.

44:36.860 --> 44:39.150
LET'S GO.
- FINE.

44:39.150 --> 44:40.360
BUT ONCE YOU'RE IN THE ATTIC,

44:40.360 --> 44:43.160
YOU NEED TO BE
ABSOLUTELY SILENT.

44:43.160 --> 44:45.830
MOM IS THE WORLD'S
LIGHTEST SLEEPER.

44:45.830 --> 44:47.660
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO TELL ME THIS, MAN.

44:47.660 --> 44:49.450
I'LL BE AS QUIET AS A RODENT.

44:49.450 --> 44:52.330
- MOUSE, AS QUIET AS A MOUSE.

44:52.330 --> 44:54.040
- A MOUSE IS A RODENT.

44:54.040 --> 44:55.630
- YEAH, BUT SO IS A SQUIRREL.

44:55.630 --> 44:58.130
- SQUIRRELS
ARE RELATIVELY QUIET, MAN.

44:58.130 --> 45:01.130
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

45:01.130 --> 45:03.050
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
SORRY.

45:15.900 --> 45:18.860
[loud clatter]

45:29.240 --> 45:31.620
[door opens]

45:31.620 --> 45:33.000
- [whispering]
GO, GO, GO.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.080
- HONEY?
IS THAT YOU?

45:35.080 --> 45:36.790
- THIS WAY, THIS WAY.

45:40.130 --> 45:42.380
COME ON, THIS WAY.

45:45.390 --> 45:46.930
- HEY.
- HEY.

45:46.930 --> 45:49.350
- WHAT HAPPENED TO GOING TO BED
AT A REASONABLE HOUR?

45:49.350 --> 45:52.520
- I DID, I WAS ASLEEP,
I JUST REALLY NEEDED A...

45:54.350 --> 45:56.190
BANANA.
- DON'T TOUCH THAT.

45:56.190 --> 45:57.860
IT WAS EXPENSIVE.

45:57.860 --> 45:59.110
- REALLY?

45:59.110 --> 46:00.730
- THE BOWL.

46:00.730 --> 46:01.940
- OH.

46:01.940 --> 46:04.200
- [sighs]

46:04.200 --> 46:05.610
I GOT A CALL TONIGHT

46:05.610 --> 46:07.820
FROM THE MOUNTAIN ACADEMY
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

46:07.820 --> 46:10.240
- YEAH.
- THEY CAN'T FIND HIM.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.580
HE ESCAPED.

46:12.580 --> 46:14.830
THEY'VE BEEN SEARCHING
THE AREA,

46:14.830 --> 46:17.290
AND THEY HAVEN'T FOUND
ANYTHING YET.

46:17.290 --> 46:19.090
I AM JUST--
I AM WORRIED TO DEATH.

46:19.090 --> 46:20.500
I-I KNOW YOUR BROTHER...
- MOM.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.460
- AND I KNOW WHAT
HE'S CAPABLE OF, AND I--

46:22.460 --> 46:26.300
- IT'S OKAY.
BEN'S GONNA BE FINE.

46:26.300 --> 46:29.930
- YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, DO YOU?

46:29.930 --> 46:32.600
- NO. NO. I-

46:34.890 --> 46:37.310
- YOU DON'T THINK
HE'D COME HERE TO THE--

46:37.310 --> 46:38.480
[chair scrapes]

46:39.770 --> 46:40.940
WHAT WAS THAT?

46:40.940 --> 46:42.280
- WAS THAT UPSTAIRS?

46:42.280 --> 46:44.190
- NO.

46:44.190 --> 46:45.780
- YEAH, I THINK IT WAS UPSTAIRS.
PROBABLY--

46:45.780 --> 46:47.990
- NO, IT CAME
FROM RIGHT OVER HERE.

46:47.990 --> 46:51.780
- [screaming]

46:51.780 --> 46:54.450
WHAT DID YOU DO?

46:54.450 --> 46:57.460
FELIX, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

46:57.460 --> 47:00.340
I TOLD YOU THAT WAS EXPENSIVE.

47:00.340 --> 47:03.670
WHY WOULD YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

47:05.840 --> 47:08.930
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME
CLEAN IT UP?

47:13.930 --> 47:15.480
FELIX!

47:15.480 --> 47:17.640
- JUST TRYING TO HELP.

47:34.490 --> 47:37.500
[whispering] THE ANSWER IS "B."
- ARE YOU INSANE?

47:37.500 --> 47:39.170
- I NEED THE REPORT CARD.

47:39.170 --> 47:41.540
- DO YOU NOT SEE THAT I'M IN
THE MIDDLE OF A TEST RIGHT NOW?

47:41.540 --> 47:42.750
JUST GET IT AT LUNCH.

47:49.760 --> 47:50.970
- HEY, HEY.

47:50.970 --> 47:52.390
MY MOM'S BEEN ON MY ASS
ALL WEEK.

47:52.390 --> 47:53.680
I NEED IT NOW.

47:56.390 --> 47:59.520
- YOU'RE KILLING ME.
- YEAH, BUDDY.

48:04.770 --> 48:05.730
THANK YOU.

48:05.730 --> 48:07.650
HEY, SERIOUSLY,
THE ANSWER IS "B."

48:07.650 --> 48:10.740
- SERIOUSLY, SHUT UP.

48:10.740 --> 48:12.870
- IT IS.
I CAN SEE EMILY'S TEST.

48:14.660 --> 48:15.950
HI.

48:15.950 --> 48:17.580
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

48:17.580 --> 48:19.370
- "ARE YOU SERIOUS?"

48:34.220 --> 48:37.470
- ANY WORD WHEN WE CAN EXPECT
TO SEE YOUR REPORT CARD?

48:37.470 --> 48:40.060
- YOU MEAN...

48:40.060 --> 48:41.310
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE?

48:41.310 --> 48:42.650
- IS THAT IT?

48:42.650 --> 48:44.730
- YEP, GOT IT IN THE MAIL
THIS MORNING.

48:44.730 --> 48:47.730
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
IT CAME?

48:48.740 --> 48:50.110
- HOW DO YOU THINK YOU DID?

48:50.110 --> 48:52.570
- I THINK I DID OKAY.

48:55.160 --> 48:57.620
- OH, MY GOD!

48:57.620 --> 49:00.290
[celestial music]

49:00.290 --> 49:01.790
- STRAIGHT "A"s...

49:01.790 --> 49:04.460
THE HOLY GRAIL OF ACADEMIA.

49:04.460 --> 49:07.130
EVERY PARENT WANTS TO SEE
THEIR KID SUCCEED.

49:07.130 --> 49:10.300
THEY ALSO WANT THE BRAGGING
RIGHTS AT CHRISTMAS PARTIES.

49:10.300 --> 49:12.430
THEY WANT THE HONOR ROLL
BUMPER STICKER

49:12.430 --> 49:14.090
ON THE BACK OF THEIR MINIVAN.

49:14.090 --> 49:17.350
"A"s ARE LIKE A REWARD
FOR PROPERLY RAISING YOUR KID.

49:17.350 --> 49:20.520
IT'S LIKE CATNIP FOR PARENTS.

49:20.520 --> 49:21.640
- [laughs]

49:21.640 --> 49:24.350
WOW, FELIX!
THIS IS--

49:24.350 --> 49:26.900
WOW!
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

49:26.900 --> 49:29.900
YOU EVEN GOT AN "A"
IN MR. HARRIS' CLASS.

49:29.900 --> 49:32.150
- WHAT, YOU DIDN'T THINK I'D BE
ABLE TO HANDLE CHEMISTRY?

49:32.150 --> 49:35.070
- NO, NO, NO, WE JUST GOT A CALL
FROM HIM A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

49:35.070 --> 49:36.700
ABOUT A PARENT-TEACHER
CONFERENCE.

49:36.700 --> 49:38.280
I WAS WORRIED
THERE WAS A PROBLEM,

49:38.280 --> 49:40.080
BUT APPARENTLY NOT.

49:40.080 --> 49:41.660
- NO.

49:41.660 --> 49:44.210
- YOU GUYS AREN'T ACTUALLY
GOING TO THAT, RIGHT?

49:44.210 --> 49:47.340
- WELL, YOUR DAD CAN'T MAKE IT
BECAUSE HE HAS A REAL JOB,

49:47.340 --> 49:48.800
BUT I ALREADY SAID YES.

49:48.800 --> 49:50.760
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET
WITH HIM ON SATURDAY.

49:50.760 --> 49:52.670
- BUT THERE'S REALLY
NO REASON TO.

49:52.670 --> 49:54.010
I HAVE AN "A" IN HIS CLASS.

49:54.010 --> 49:56.680
- I ALREADY TOLD HIM
WE WERE GOING, FELIX.

49:56.680 --> 49:59.680
- OKAY, YOU COULD
JUST CANCEL IT.

49:59.680 --> 50:03.100
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
- IS THERE...

50:03.100 --> 50:04.730
SOMETHING WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

50:04.730 --> 50:07.060
- NO. NO.
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL

50:07.060 --> 50:08.110
LIKE YOU HAVE TO GO.

50:08.110 --> 50:10.020
- WE'RE GOING.

50:10.020 --> 50:11.070
- GREAT.

50:11.070 --> 50:12.320
- TERRIBLE.

50:12.320 --> 50:14.150
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

50:14.150 --> 50:15.450
- IS UNREAL HOW MR. HARRIS

50:15.450 --> 50:17.660
ALWAYS MANAGES
TO RUIN EVERYTHING.

50:17.660 --> 50:21.200
- SO I GUESS YOU GOT TO TELL
YOUR PARENTS THE TRUTH.

50:21.200 --> 50:22.700
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

50:22.700 --> 50:25.120
I'M GONNA FAKE
A PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCE.

50:25.120 --> 50:28.380
- WELL, THAT SOUNDS
DIFFICULT/IMPOSSIBLE.

50:28.380 --> 50:30.130
- MM, DIFFICULT, YES.

50:30.130 --> 50:32.960
IMPOSSIBLE...

50:32.960 --> 50:36.180
PROBABLY ALSO YES, BUT THAT'S
NEVER STOPPED US BEFORE.

50:39.220 --> 50:41.720
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
A SHADY MIDDLE-AGED MAN.

50:43.520 --> 50:44.890
- WHY?

50:44.890 --> 50:47.520
- TO ACT AS MR. HARRIS
DURING THE CONFERENCE.

50:47.520 --> 50:50.110
- [scoffs]

50:50.110 --> 50:51.900
DO YOU EVER
JUST STAND BACK SOMETIMES

50:51.900 --> 50:55.320
AND LOOK AT YOUR PLAN
AND THINK TO YOURSELF,

50:55.320 --> 50:57.740
"WOW, I AM DUMB"?

50:57.740 --> 50:59.570
- WHY DO YOU GOT TO BE
LIKE THIS?

50:59.570 --> 51:02.740
- MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I'M SICK
OF NEARLY GETTING ARRESTED

51:02.740 --> 51:04.160
EVERY TIME THAT I HELP YOU.

51:04.160 --> 51:06.540
- WHO SAYS I'M ASKING
FOR YOUR HELP?

51:06.540 --> 51:08.250
- YOU ARE ALWAYS ASKING
FOR MY HELP.

51:08.250 --> 51:10.590
- FALSE.

51:10.590 --> 51:13.750
I DON'T NEED IT.

51:13.750 --> 51:16.880
I GOT THIS.
- GOOD...

51:16.880 --> 51:19.180
'CAUSE I WOULD SAY NO.
- WHY?

51:19.180 --> 51:20.340
- BECAUSE...

51:20.340 --> 51:22.510
I'M SICK OF YOUR SKETCHY PLANS.

51:22.510 --> 51:24.810
I HELP YOU BECAUSE
YOU'RE MY FRIEND,

51:24.810 --> 51:29.810
BUT I CANNOT KEEP DOING
THIS STUFF.

51:29.810 --> 51:31.770
- NO.

51:33.230 --> 51:35.150
IT'S COOL.

51:39.110 --> 51:42.620
I'LL JUST HANDLE IT MYSELF.
- GOOD LUCK.

51:48.120 --> 51:50.040
- DANNY ISN'T WRONG.

51:50.040 --> 51:52.170
I'M NOT GOING TO CONTEST
WHAT HE SAID.

51:55.760 --> 51:58.630
GUESS I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO PULL THIS OFF BY MYSELF.

52:02.260 --> 52:04.930
[school bell ringing]

52:04.930 --> 52:06.640
- SHAMUS.

52:06.640 --> 52:08.520
HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?
REMEMBER ME?

52:08.520 --> 52:10.730
OH, COME ON, SHAMUS,
IT'S FELIX!

52:10.730 --> 52:12.520
I GAVE YOU TWO PACKS OF GUM
LAST WEEK.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.400
[knock at door]
HEY.

52:14.400 --> 52:18.900
I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.
ARE YOU INTERESTED?

52:18.900 --> 52:22.030
- LET ME PUT ON SOME PANTS.

52:26.200 --> 52:30.710
SO YOU EXPECT ME TO DRESS
LIKE A TEACHER?

52:30.710 --> 52:32.210
- YEAH, WE JUST NEED
TO CONVINCE MY MOM

52:32.210 --> 52:34.250
THAT YOU'RE MR. HARRIS
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

52:34.250 --> 52:37.880
- YOU GOING TO PAY ME?
- I DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY.

52:37.880 --> 52:41.720
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?
- UM, 40 BUCKS.

52:41.720 --> 52:44.050
- WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
- UM...

52:44.050 --> 52:45.760
A CROSSBOW.

52:45.760 --> 52:49.100
- 40 BUCKS AND A CROSSBOW--
YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL.

52:49.100 --> 52:52.560
- COOL, COOL. JUST MAKE SURE
YOU WEAR SOMETHING NICE.

52:52.560 --> 52:53.980
- "SOMETHING NICE"?

52:53.980 --> 52:55.900
- YEAH, LIKE A COLLARED SHIRT
OR SOMETHING.

52:55.900 --> 52:57.900
DO I LOOK LIKE
THE SORT OF FELLOW

52:57.900 --> 52:59.860
WHO OWNS A COLLARED SHIRT?

52:59.860 --> 53:01.280
- LET'S DO THIS--

53:01.280 --> 53:03.490
MEET ME AT MY HOUSE
TOMORROW MORNING...

53:03.490 --> 53:05.320
AND I'LL LET YOU BORROW
SOME OF MY DAD'S CLOTHES.

53:05.320 --> 53:06.870
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY?

53:06.870 --> 53:09.000
- ALL RIGHT.
- COOL.

53:09.000 --> 53:13.500
- SO YOU WANT ME TO ACT
LIKE MR. HARRIS.

53:13.500 --> 53:17.040
THINK I CAN PULL IT OFF?

53:17.040 --> 53:18.880
- YEAH.

53:26.800 --> 53:29.390
- WHY? WHY?
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

53:29.390 --> 53:31.600
- WHAT HAPPENED WITH BEING
AS QUIET AS A RODENT?

53:31.600 --> 53:33.520
- I WAS BALLS DEEP
IN RODENT QUIETNESS

53:33.520 --> 53:35.650
UNTIL I FOUND THESE HORSESHOES,

53:35.650 --> 53:37.570
AND I WAS FACED
WITH A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION.

53:37.570 --> 53:39.110
- [laughing]
WHAT?

53:39.110 --> 53:41.320
I'M FAILING TO SEE
THE DIFFICULTY HERE.

53:41.320 --> 53:45.360
- IT WAS HORSESHOES
VERSUS QUIETNESS.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.910
- ARE YOU TRYING TO GET CAUGHT
BY MOM AND DAD?

53:47.910 --> 53:50.040
- NO, OKAY? LOOK, I DIDN'T GO
THROUGH THE TROUBLE

53:50.040 --> 53:52.330
OF ESCAPING THE MOUNTAIN ACADEMY
JUST SO I COULD BE BORED

53:52.330 --> 53:54.210
OUT OF MY FRICKIN' MIND HERE
IN THE ATTIC.

53:54.210 --> 53:56.960
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, OUT
OF EVERYTHING YOU COULD'VE DONE,

53:56.960 --> 53:59.000
ALL THIS,
YOU DECIDE TO THROW HORSESHOES?

53:59.000 --> 54:02.590
- YES. WHAT DO YOU DO
IN YOUR FREE TIME, FELIX?

54:02.590 --> 54:05.800
- IT'S COMPLICATED. YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME IF I TOLD YOU, BUT...

54:05.800 --> 54:07.350
- TRY ME.

54:07.350 --> 54:11.140
- I JUST BRIBED A JANITOR
WITH A CROSSBOW

54:11.140 --> 54:13.230
TO FAKE
A PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCE.

54:13.230 --> 54:15.980
- THAT SOUNDS AMAZING.
LET ME HELP YOU.

54:15.980 --> 54:17.480
- NO.

54:17.480 --> 54:19.860
- I WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE ASSET
TO YOUR TEAM.

54:19.860 --> 54:23.530
I'M PROFESSIONAL. AND HOW DO YOU
KNOW YOUR PLAN DOESN'T NEED ME?

54:23.530 --> 54:26.110
- BECAUSE MY PLAN DOESN'T
INVOLVE GETTING SCREWED

54:26.110 --> 54:28.320
AND GOING BACK TO JAIL.
- OKAY, AT LEAST--

54:28.320 --> 54:31.660
AT THE VERY LEAST,
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.910
- WELL, FIRST I'M GOING
TO NEED PIZZA.

54:34.910 --> 54:36.830
- OKAY, WHY PIZZA?

54:36.830 --> 54:39.040
- BECAUSE I'M--
- STOP. I KNOW WHY PIZZA--

54:39.040 --> 54:40.290
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING
TO PUT EX-LAX

54:40.290 --> 54:42.000
ON THE PIZZA,
GIVE IT TO THE TEACHER.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.460
HE'S GOING TO HAVE DIARRHEA

54:43.460 --> 54:44.920
AND NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO SHOW UP TO THE MEETING.

54:44.920 --> 54:46.430
- WHAT? NO, I--
- YOU'RE GOING TO DO

54:46.430 --> 54:48.430
THE "IMPOSTER PIZZA DELIVERY
GUY" SWITCH, AREN'T YOU?

54:48.430 --> 54:51.850
- BEN. I'M GETTING PIZZA
BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY.

54:52.720 --> 54:54.100
- OH.

55:08.910 --> 55:11.530
[knock at door]

55:11.530 --> 55:13.540
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? MY MOM'S
GOING TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

55:13.540 --> 55:16.290
- YOU SAID BE HERE AT 9:00.
- THAT WAS AN HOUR AGO.

55:16.290 --> 55:17.830
- OH. HUH.

55:24.340 --> 55:26.010
- YOU KNOW HOW TO TIE
A TIE, RIGHT?

55:26.010 --> 55:29.890
- WELL, I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

55:29.890 --> 55:33.720
- REMEMBER, I NEED YOU
IN ROOM 34--CRAP.

55:33.720 --> 55:35.220
- WHAT? WHAT?
- COME ON, GET INSIDE.

55:35.220 --> 55:37.180
- WHAT? WHAT?
- MY MOM'S HERE. GET INSIDE.

55:37.180 --> 55:39.150
- OOH.
- GET INSIDE.

55:41.520 --> 55:42.480
UPSTAIRS, COME ON.

55:44.530 --> 55:46.190
NO, NO.

55:53.330 --> 55:54.700
- FELIX?

55:54.700 --> 55:56.830
- YEAH?

55:58.830 --> 56:00.330
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT WAS THAT?

56:00.330 --> 56:04.210
- W-WHAT WAS WHAT?
- NEVER MIND.

56:04.210 --> 56:06.510
REMEMBER, WE HAVE TO LEAVE
FOR THAT MEETING SOON.

56:06.510 --> 56:07.470
- OKAY.

56:24.190 --> 56:25.520
[thud]

56:25.520 --> 56:27.610
[muffled voices]

56:27.610 --> 56:28.990
- HONEY?

56:28.990 --> 56:30.860
WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE?

56:30.860 --> 56:33.450
- UH, N-NOTHING,
I JUST TRIPPED.

56:33.450 --> 56:36.450
- YOU READY TO LEAVE SOON?

56:36.450 --> 56:38.120
- YEP, SOUNDS GOOD.

56:44.080 --> 56:45.750
[whispering]
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?

56:45.750 --> 56:46.960
- [whispering]
WHO IS THAT?

56:46.960 --> 56:48.760
- IT'S SHAMUS.
- WHO IS SHAMUS?

56:48.760 --> 56:50.800
- HE'S MY ONE HOPE
AT FAKING THIS CONFERENCE.

56:50.800 --> 56:52.800
- SERIOUSLY? THAT?
- YES.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.430
YOU SCREWED
THIS WHOLE THING UP, MAN.

56:54.430 --> 56:56.260
WHAT DID YOU DO?
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

56:56.260 --> 56:58.310
WHEN I SEE BEARDED PEOPLE
IN MY ATTIC, I GO BUCK WILD.

56:58.310 --> 57:00.270
- OH, YOU GO BUCK WILD, YEAH?

57:00.270 --> 57:02.730
- YEAH.
- SHAMUS, SHAMUS, WAKE UP.

57:02.730 --> 57:04.900
- OH, MAN.
- SHAMUS, WAKE UP.

57:04.900 --> 57:08.900
SHAMUS, WAKE UP, BUDDY!
WAKE UP.

57:08.900 --> 57:10.490
THE CONFERENCE IS IN 20 MINUTES.

57:10.490 --> 57:12.150
- JUST TELL MOM
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

57:12.150 --> 57:15.200
- NO. THE REAL MR. HARRIS
IS GOING TO BE THERE.

57:15.200 --> 57:19.080
- FELIX, ARE YOU READY, HONEY?
- [sighs]

57:19.080 --> 57:21.330
- I GOT YOU, MAN.
- NO.

57:21.330 --> 57:23.370
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
STAY HERE.

57:23.370 --> 57:25.580
- TRUST ME, DUDE, I GOT YOU.
- NO.

57:25.580 --> 57:26.790
- YES.

57:26.790 --> 57:28.880
- FELIX, LET'S GO!

57:28.880 --> 57:30.380
- BE RIGHT THERE!

57:30.380 --> 57:32.420
NO!

57:32.420 --> 57:36.050
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, HONEY.
COME ON.

57:36.050 --> 57:37.970
I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

57:37.970 --> 57:39.970
A LITTLE ANXIOUS
ABOUT THIS MEETING.

57:39.970 --> 57:42.020
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

57:42.020 --> 57:45.100
- [sighs] I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU FEEL.

58:03.620 --> 58:06.540
[vehicle departing]

58:20.430 --> 58:22.730
[exhales deeply]

58:22.730 --> 58:25.850
[tires screeching]

58:57.970 --> 59:00.550
- BOOM TOWN.

59:09.480 --> 59:10.610
TARGET ACQUIRED.

59:25.120 --> 59:28.250
[clattering overhead]

59:45.600 --> 59:48.890
- YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M NOT GONNA BE AVAILABLE

59:48.890 --> 59:51.020
TILL LATE THIS AFTERNOON.

59:51.020 --> 59:52.520
YOU GOT IT.

59:57.950 --> 01:00:00.240
[gasps]

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:09.250
- MRS. ANDERS, YOU'RE NOT
DUE HERE UNTIL 12:00 NOON.

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:13.710
- OH, MRS. O'NEIL.
I'M FELIX'S MOM.

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.800
- FELIX'S MOM?

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.970
FELIX...

01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:20.510
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:24.100
- OOH, WERE WE SCHEDULED LATER?
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.770
YOU WEREN'T SCHEDULED AT ALL.

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.480
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.480
OH, IS THIS BECAUSE FELIX
GOT AN "A" IN YOUR CLASS?

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.150
- [laughs]
THAT'S, UH...

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:38.530
NO, FELIX NEVER GOT AN "A"
IN MY CLASS.

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:42.070
FELIX NEVER EVEN PASSED
MY CLASS.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.040
- [coughs]

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.960
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE THINKING
OF THE RIGHT STUDENT?

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.000
- OH, I'M POSITIVE.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.500
- [grunts]

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:58.090
- FELIX, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO EXPLAIN THIS?

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.340
- MRS. O'NEIL, YOU'RE AWARE
THAT YOUR SON...

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.350
NO LONGER ATTENDS
MY CLASS, RIGHT?

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:10.390
YEAH, FELIX--

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:17.860
- OH, MY GOD.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.990
MR. HARRIS?

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:22.650
MR. HARRIS, ARE YOU OKAY?

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:25.280
- THIS IS PERFECTLY NORMAL.
- HOW IS THIS NORMAL?

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.700
- HE'S NARCOLEPTIC OR SOMETHING.
- OH.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:30.790
I'M CALLING AN AMBULANCE.
- NO, MOM, HE'S FINE.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.710
- YES, A TEACHER JUST...
- HE'S OKAY, HE REALLY IS.

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:36.250
- HAD A STROKE OR SOMETHING.
- TRUST ME.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:39.630
- I DON'T KNOW.
WE NEED MEDICAL HELP.

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:41.170
- MOM, WE DON'T NEED HELP.
WE GOT IT.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:43.300
- EASTWOOD HIGH SCHOOL.
- WE GOT THIS.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.720
- PLEASE HURRY.
- HE DOES THIS ALL THE TIME.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.350
- I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE.
- NO, WAIT, MOM.

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.220
MOM, CHILL, CHILL,
CHILL, CHILL.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.680
- OH, MY GOD.

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.900
BEN?

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:58.110
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

01:01:58.110 --> 01:01:59.530
BEN, WHAT'S WRONG?

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:03.070
- I TRIED.
HE JUST--FELIX--

01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:06.160
- OH, MY GOD,
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.740
HONEY?
- I DON'T WANT MONTANA.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:10.040
- OH.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.960
WAIT A MINUTE. W-WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING HERE?

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.580
- I DON'T KNOW.
HE--WHY WOULD HE BE HERE?

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.840
- DON'T YOU DARE LIE TO ME.
I WANT ANSWERS.

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:24.420
YOU FAILED MR. HARRIS' CLASS,
DIDN'T YOU?

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.970
- NO, I DIDN'T--

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:27.640
- YOU FAKED YOUR GRADES?
- WHAT?

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:31.430
- I AM GONNA TALK TO MR. TRUMAN
ABOUT THIS IMMEDIATELY.

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:34.310
- HE'S NOT HERE.
IT'S THE WEEKEND.

01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:36.480
- WELL, THEN I PLAN
ON MEETING WITH HIM

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.560
FIRST THING MONDAY MORNING.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.900
AND WHEN WE GET HOME,
YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM,

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:46.240
BECAUSE YOU ARE GROUNDED...
INDEFINITELY.

01:02:49.450 --> 01:02:52.620
- WELL, AT LEAST
NO ONE GOT ARRESTED.

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:58.170
LUCKILY, BEN USED
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SEDATIVE.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:00.630
MR. HARRIS WAS TAKEN
TO THE HOSPITAL

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:04.460
AND WOKE UP A FEW HOURS LATER
WITH SHORT-TERM AMNESIA.

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.510
SHAMUS REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:11.600
AND LEFT THE HOUSE
BEFORE WE RETURNED.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.640
HE MADE SURE TO RAID
OUR PANTRY FIRST.

01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:20.150
[telephone ringing]

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:22.570
- YOU'VE REACHED THE OFFICE
OF PRINCIPAL TRUMAN.

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:24.740
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE
AFTER THE BEEP.

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.400
- HI, MR. TRUMAN,
THIS IS JULIE O'NEIL...

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.280
- THIS HAPPENS
TO BE THE THIRD VOICE MAIL

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.660
MY MOM HAS LEFT FOR MR. TRUMAN.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.120
- I'M SORRY TO CALL AGAIN...

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.160
- HOPING SHE DOESN'T GET THROUGH
ANYTIME SOON.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.330
- CONCERNED ABOUT MY SON...

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:39.790
- BEN.

01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:42.290
BEN TRIED TO TAKE THE BLAME
FOR THE WHOLE THING.

01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:43.920
MOM WASN'T SURE
WHAT TO BELIEVE.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.550
REGARDLESS, HE WAS SENT BACK
TO THE MOUNTAIN ACADEMY,

01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:51.180
OR, AS HE CALLS IT,
"PROJECT BUTTHOLE."

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.440
HE TOLD ME HE'S ALREADY
PLANNED HIS NEXT ESCAPE.

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:03.690
AS FOR ME, THE VACATION'S OVER.

01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:07.860
I MAY NOT WANT TO SPEND MY LIFE
AT A DESK JOB,

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.530
BUT I SURE AS HELL DON'T WANT
TO SPEND IT IN JAIL EITHER.

01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:12.950
[car horn honking]

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.790
- HEY, LET'S DO SOMETHING FUN.

01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:21.460
- I CAN'T.
I'M GROUNDED.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.590
- I HAVE PIZZA.

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.300
- HEY.
- HI.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.260
SO WHAT DID
THEY GROUND YOU FOR?

01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:37.100
- IT'S...

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.890
HARD TO EXPLAIN.

01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:41.440
- WELL, OTHER THAN THAT,
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.270
- WELL...

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:44.690
MY PARENTS ARE ON THE VERGE

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:48.690
OF FINDING OUT
I'VE BEEN EXPELLED, SO...

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:51.070
- OKAY, WAIT.
[laughs]

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:53.990
THEY DON'T KNOW?
- NO.

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:58.370
THEY ARE GONNA FLIP
WHEN THEY FIND OUT.

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:01.870
- YEAH,
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:06.460
- I JUST--I JUST WANT
TO TURN THINGS AROUND.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:10.010
I THINK I REALLY MESSED UP
THIS TIME.

01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:11.880
I--

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.800
I WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING,
BUT I'M NOT--

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.600
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
WHAT THAT IS.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.980
I CAN'T KEEP
LYING TO MY PARENTS.

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:25.310
- WELL, MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LIE TO THEM AT ALL.

01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:28.610
[engine turning over]
- HUH?

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.400
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.450
I THINK I'VE BROKEN INTO
EASTWOOD ENOUGH TIMES THIS WEEK.

01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:40.660
- WE'RE NOT BREAKING IN, SILLY.
COME ON.

01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:57.760
- THIS IS CRAZY.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.140
YOU CAN ALMOST SEE
THE WHOLE CAMPUS FROM HERE.

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.810
- I KNOW. IT'S AWESOME, RIGHT?
- YEAH, IT IS.

01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:06.610
SO MANY GOOD MEMORIES HERE.

01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:09.320
- YEAH.
- I'M GOING TO MISS IT.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.030
MONTANA'S GONNA SUCK.

01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:15.990
- COME ON, DON'T SAY THAT.
THERE'S A WAY OUT OF THIS.

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:18.370
- MY MOM'S NOT GONNA STOP
UNTIL SHE FINDS THE TRUTH.

01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:19.660
- WELL...

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.620
IF YOU COULD GET TRUMAN
TO RE-ENROLL YOU,

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.000
YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO LIE
TO YOUR MOM AT ALL.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.040
YOU'D ACTUALLY BE GOING
TO EASTWOOD.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.290
- I'M NOT EXACTLY
IN THE POSITION TO GET TRUMAN

01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:31.710
TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:33.510
- THEN I GUESS YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO GET HIM

01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:34.800
TO SEE THINGS YOUR WAY.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.340
- DO YOU KNOW
SOMETHING I DON'T?

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.300
- POSSIBLY.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.890
- WHAT?

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:43.310
- WELL, YOU KNOW
THAT PIZZA PLACE I WORK FOR?

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:44.480
- YEAH.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.020
- WE DELIVER 24 HOURS A DAY.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.060
- SO?

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.770
- SO...

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:53.990
THAT MEANS...
[vehicle approaching]

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:55.490
WAIT FOR IT.

01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:57.410
NOW.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.870
- I DON'T GET IT.

01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:04.870
- WATCH.

01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:11.000
- WHOA. IS THAT MR. TRUMAN?
- YEAH.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.800
- WHAT IS HE DOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.170
HE ORDERS A BARBECUE-CHICKEN
PIZZA EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT.

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:18.590
- WHY?
- NO IDEA.

01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:21.050
WANT TO FIND OUT?

01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:42.370
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S LOOKING AT?

01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:45.200
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT TIME IS IT?

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.750
- IT'S 11:00.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:54.380
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE
SO LATE?

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.800
- SHADY STUFF.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:59.590
- [laughs]
I WISH WE COULD SEE HIS SCREEN.

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:02.800
- I THINK THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:18.240
- OH.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.240
[pop music playing]

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:26.660
*

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:29.620
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I'M SORRY.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.210
- I KNOW.

01:08:31.210 --> 01:08:33.130
- I REALLY MEAN THAT.

01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:34.170
*

01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:35.460
- I KNOW.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.800
- ASKING YOU TO RISK YOUR NECK
FOR ME ALL THE TIME

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.840
IS PRETTY SELFISH.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.220
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
IF IT WAS YOU WHO NEEDED ME

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.640
TO DO SOME SHADY STUFF,

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.180
I WOULD DO IT IN AN INSTANT.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:51.020
- WELL, I WAS PLANNING

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.399
ON STEALING
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:57.529
[both laugh]

01:08:57.529 --> 01:08:59.990
- I BROUGHT YOU A BURRITO.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.120
- YEAH, OKAY, I FORGIVE YOU.

01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:08.250
WHO'S THAT?

01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:09.540
- OH, THAT'S KATIE.

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:13.170
- HI.
- HI.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.340
YOU REALLY THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING SHADY ON HERE?

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.680
- ABSOLUTELY.
THERE'S--THERE'S GOT TO BE.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.970
- SO YOU RECORDED THIS
FROM TRUMAN'S COMPUTER?

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:29.180
- YEAH. WHAT TIME DID YOU
SEE HIM LOG ON?

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.689
- AROUND 11:00.

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:33.399
- WAIT.
HOW FAR BACK DOES THIS GO?

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:35.609
- I MEAN, TECHNICALLY, WE CAN GO
ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE POINT

01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:36.939
WHERE WE BUGGED HIS COMPUTER.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.569
I GOT EVERYTHING
ON THE HARD DRIVE, SO...

01:09:38.569 --> 01:09:40.609
- WAIT, WAIT, LOOK.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:43.740
HE PLAYS ONLINE BLACKJACK?

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.279
BUT WHY WOULD HE DO THIS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:47.700
AT SCHOOL?

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.700
- I MEAN--HE MUST BE HIDING IT
FROM SOMEONE.

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.830
- HIS WIFE, PROBABLY.

01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:57.340
- WHOA, LOOK AT THIS.

01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:00.380
HE JUST LOST $600 RIGHT THERE.
- OH--

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:02.340
- I'D SAY HE DEFINITELY
HAS A PROBLEM.

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.510
- OH, WOW.

01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:07.600
- NO, THIS IS INSANE.
HE JUST LOST ANOTHER GRAND.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.180
- WOW!
HE SUCKS.

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:12.230
I MEAN, HE'S GOT TO GIVE UP
AT SOME POINT, RIGHT?

01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:13.940
I MEAN, THIS IS CRAZY.

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.900
- MAYBE HIS WIFE
MIGHT WANT TO SEE THIS.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.650
YEAH.

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.690
WHAT'S HE DOING?
IS HE QUITTING?

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:25.070
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:32.040
- DOES THAT--?

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.790
DOES THAT SAY "EASTWOOD"?

01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:38.130
- WAIT.
DID HE JUST--

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:41.880
- HE JUST STOLE MONEY
FROM THE SCHOOL.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.340
- DUDE, THAT IS, LIKE,
SERIOUS JAIL TIME RIGHT THERE.

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:46.590
THIS IS HUGE.

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:48.680
- WAIT.
SO WE JUST RECORDED--

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:52.390
- WE JUST RECORDED
BLACKMAIL JACKPOT.

01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:56.100
- DUDE, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
HE MUST BE OUT OF HIS MIND.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.480
- DOES THIS MEAN WE CAN GET
TRUMAN TO RE-ENROLL YOU?

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.690
- THIS MEANS WE CAN GET TRUMAN
TO DO ANYTHING.

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:04.990
- YES.
[laughs]

01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:06.070
YES!

01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:12.160
[electronic beep]

01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:32.600
- OOH, TELL HIM TO COME ALONE.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.220
- BUT WHO WOULD HE BRING?

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.940
- JUST DO IT.
IT'S CREEPY.

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:41.520
- OH, ALSO TELL HIM
HE'S A DOUCHE.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.530
- WHY?

01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:45.320
- 'CAUSE HE'S A DOUCHE.

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.780
[knock at door]

01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:56.960
- YOU GOING TO BED SOON?

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.380
FELIX.

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:05.710
- SORRY. YEAH, I'M GOING
TO PASS OUT IN A BIT.

01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:07.630
- OKAY,
JUST CHECKING IN ON YOU.

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:09.760
GET SOME SLEEP.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.300
- GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.320
[laughing]
GARY.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.450
NICE CAR.

01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:32.320
- ARE YOU REALLY THIS STUPID?

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.950
HOW MANY TIMES DO I NEED TO HAVE
YOU ARRESTED THIS WEEK?

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:36.290
[cell phone beeps]

01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:38.660
- OH, YOU'RE GOING
TO CALL THE COPS?

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.040
IF YOU ARE, THEN GREAT.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.620
I'D LOVE TO TELL THEM
ABOUT THE $10,000

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:45.880
YOU STOLE FROM THE SCHOOL
TO FUND YOUR GAMBLING ADDICTION.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.090
YEAH.
- IT'S YOUR WORD AGAINST MINE.

01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:51.590
WHO DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA
SIDE WITH, ANYWAY?

01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:53.430
- I BUGGED YOUR LAPTOP, GARY.

01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:56.350
I HAVE HARD EVIDENCE
OF ALL YOUR ACTIVITY

01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:57.890
ON MY HARD DRIVE.

01:12:57.890 --> 01:13:00.940
AND, FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.400
PICKING SIDES.

01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:07.730
- WHAT IS THIS?

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:10.490
DO YOU WANT MONEY?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:11.740
- ENROLLMENT.

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.820
- "ENROLLMENT"?
- I WANT ENROLLMENT

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:15.780
IN THE NEXT SEMESTER
AT EASTWOOD.

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.950
AND I WANT THE FORMS FILLED OUT
BY MONDAY.

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:21.210
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- GARY.

01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:23.370
THESE LAST FEW DAYS
HAVE BEEN HELL FOR ME.

01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:25.590
BUT I KNOW THERE'S STILL
A CHANCE FOR ME

01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.380
TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.800
- W-WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.970
- YOU ONCE ASKED ME,

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:33.720
"WHAT KIND OF FUTURE DO YOU SEE
FOR YOURSELF"?

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.510
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT...

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:39.810
A LOT.

01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:42.310
AND MY FUTURE IS HERE
AT EASTWOOD.

01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:44.270
- NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, FELIX.

01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:46.060
THE FACULTY WON'T APPROVE IT.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.900
- I THINK YOU'LL FIND THE WAY.

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.610
- OH, REALLY?
WHY IS THAT?

01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:54.200
- 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO TO JAIL, GARY.

01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:58.160
[dog barking in the distance]

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.660
- YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:02.370
I NEED THOSE FORMS AUTHORIZED
BY TOMORROW MORNING.

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:03.670
YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:05.750
HOLD ON A SECOND.

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:08.130
COME ON IN, COME ON IN.
HI.

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:11.050
I NEED YOU TO SEARCH
FOR FORM A-13.

01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:13.010
IT'S THE ENROLLMENT FORM, OKAY?
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:14.590
GET RIGHT ON IT.
- GREAT. GREAT.

01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:17.260
- YEAH, I'VE GOT MY T.A.
WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOW, UH-HUH.

01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:36.240
- FELIX!

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.700
WHAT IN THE--
- DANNY!

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.120
- NO, NO, NO!

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.330
- OW! OW!
- CHILL.

01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:46.620
- I HATE YOU.
I HATE YOU...

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.460
BUT I RESPECT YOU.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.420
OH. OKAY.

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.960
AH. WAIT, SO--

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.340
OKAY, SO HOW DID LAST NIGHT
WITH TRUMAN GO?

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.050
IS HE GONNA ENROLL YOU?
- UH...

01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:58.550
HE DIDN'T EXACTLY SAY YES,
BUT HE DIDN'T SAY NO EITHER,

01:14:58.550 --> 01:15:00.260
SO...

01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:04.100
- MAYBE YOU NEED TO THREATEN HIM
A LITTLE MORE.

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.600
- WHAT IS THIS?

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.560
UH, AN ENROLLMENT FORM.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.070
- FOR FELIX?

01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:13.860
[door closes]

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.030
- YES.

01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:16.650
- WHY?

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:19.030
- IT'S...

01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:20.780
IT'S NOT SO EASY TO EXPLAIN.

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:23.450
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:25.910
- HE'S GOT ME
IN A REALLY BAD SPOT, VANESSA.

01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:27.540
- WHAT IS IT--BLACKMAIL?
DON'T EVEN--

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.540
DON'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:32.670
- [sighs] I-I REALLY DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE HERE.

01:15:32.670 --> 01:15:37.380
- MR. TRUMAN, YES, YOU DO.
I CAN HELP YOU.

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:38.890
- "IF MY DEMANDS AREN'T MET,

01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:40.470
"THEN I WILL BE FORCED

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:44.060
TO TURN THE HARD DRIVE
DIRECTLY OVER TO THE POLICE."

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:46.020
HOW WAS THAT?
- PERFECT.

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.350
- POUNDS ALL AROUND.

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:50.060
- AMAZING.

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.190
- YOU GUYS WANT TO GET BURRITOS?
I'M STARVING.

01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:54.400
- YEAH.
- AREN'T YOU GROUNDED?

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.740
- THAT IS WHAT THIS GUY
IS HERE FOR.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.240
- OH, DON'T.

01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:04.700
[line trilling]

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:06.700
- HELLO.
- MR. TRUMAN?

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.410
- YES.

01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:10.380
- OH, MY GOD, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH YOU ALL WEEKEND.

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.540
THIS IS JULIE, FELIX'S MOM.

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.550
WE NEED TO TALK.

01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:17.470
- YES, WE DO.

01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:20.550
- OH, THAT BURRITO
WAS FANTASTIC.

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:22.760
HOWEVER, I AM GOING TO NEED
TO USE YOUR BATHROOM

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.970
AND A SCENTED CANDLE.

01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:28.690
[chuckles]

01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:29.640
WHOA.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.150
- WHERE'S THE HARD DRIVE?

01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:42.120
- I PUT IT IN THAT DRAWER.

01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:49.160
- PLEASE TELL ME YOU MADE
A COPY OF THAT VIDEO.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.710
- WHAT VIDEO?

01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:52.290
- THE TRUMAN VIDEO.

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:55.380
AND, NO,
I DID NOT MAKE A COPY.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.210
WAIT. NO.

01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:00.760
THERE IS TECHNICALLY STILL
ONE MORE COPY.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.800
- SO YOU MADE A COPY.
- TRUMAN'S COMPUTER--

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.720
THERE'S STILL A HARD COPY
ON HIS LAPTOP.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.430
- LET'S GO.

01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:17.440
VANESSA...

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.950
FUNNY SEEING YOU HERE.
DID TRUMAN PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:22.990
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- THE DRIVE--GIVE IT BACK.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.490
- BLACKMAILING
THE DEAN OF STUDENTS?

01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:29.790
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, FELIX?

01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:31.370
- NOT THAT IT'S ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS,

01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:32.960
BUT I'M NOT
DOING IT FOR THE MONEY.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.500
- I DON'T CARE. YOU'RE NOT
COMING BACK TO EASTWOOD.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.800
- IS THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU
TO SUCCEED, IS TO WATCH ME FAIL?

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.420
- YOU'RE A CHEATER, FELIX.

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:43.800
EVERYONE ELSE IS JUST TOO STUPID
TO SEE IT, EVEN YOUR PARENTS.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.550
IT'S ALL FAKE,
JUST LIKE YOUR REPORT CARD.

01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:48.260
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
PUT IN THE WORK

01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:49.930
AND ACTUALLY TRY TO PLAY
BY THE RULES?

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:52.440
- WHY DO YOU THINK I'M TRYING
TO COME BACK TO EASTWOOD?

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.810
- PROBABLY JUST TO SPITE ME.

01:17:54.810 --> 01:17:57.110
- I JUST NEED ANOTHER CHANCE.

01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:58.820
AND I'M WILLING
TO PUT IN THE WORK.

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.490
I WILL.
I WANT TO.

01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:03.780
DON'T YOU THINK I DESERVE
ONE MORE CHANCE?

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.200
WHERE'S THE DRIVE, VANESSA?

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.200
- I TOLD YOU I DON'T HAVE IT.
DIDN'T YOU MAKE A BACKUP?

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.370
- I NEED THAT DRIVE.

01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:18.590
- IT'S IN HIS BOTTOM
DESK DRAWER.

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:22.260
I'M SURE IF YOU RUN, YOU CAN
GET IT BEFORE HE WIPES IT.

01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:29.220
[door opens, slams]

01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:37.270
- WELCOME BACK, FELIX.

01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:40.570
- IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK, GARY.

01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:43.400
- I FINISHED
YOUR ENROLLMENT FORMS.

01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:52.120
SHAME YOU WON'T BE
NEEDING THEM.

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:59.090
OH, AND, UH, I WIPED EVERYTHING
OFF OF YOUR DRIVE.

01:18:59.090 --> 01:19:01.210
- WHAT ABOUT OUR DEAL?

01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:03.300
- LOOKS LIKE OUR DEAL IS OFF.

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:08.890
YOUR MOM IS ON HER WAY.
SO ARE THE POLICE.

01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:11.760
I BEAT YOU, FELIX.

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.730
- [humming]

01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:24.690
OH, MY GOD.

01:19:24.690 --> 01:19:26.280
- OH, AND I-I WOULDN'T WORRY

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:29.490
ABOUT BRINGING ANY OF THIS
UP TO THE POLICE.

01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:32.450
I'VE TIED UP ALL LOOSE ENDS.

01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:38.420
- SO YOU WIPED THE LAPTOP.

01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:43.340
- LAPTOP?

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.840
[sighs]

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.850
[triumphant rock music]

01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:57.440
*

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.810
- ALL THE EVIDENCE I NEED
IS, UH...

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:01.650
ON THAT LAPTOP.

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:08.700
- STOP!

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.740
[mouthing words]

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.910
- YOU, UH...

01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:20.580
MIGHT WANT TO TAPE THESE
BACK TOGETHER.

01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:27.630
- FELIX?

01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:30.510
- HI, MOM.

01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:33.600
- IS HE IN TROUBLE?

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.930
- UH...

01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:40.810
"TROUBLE"?
NO, NO TROUBLE.

01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:41.940
- OKAY.

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:45.730
WHAT--WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHY ARE THE POLICE HERE?

01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:49.530
- OH, WHY ARE THE POLICE HERE,
MR. TRUMAN?

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:56.040
- UM, THAT'S KIND OF...
HARD TO EXPLAIN.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:00.870
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD MEET
AT ANOTHER TIME, MRS. O'NEIL.

01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:03.840
- MR. TRUMAN, I HAVE GONE
TO GREAT LENGTHS

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.880
TO MEET WITH YOU,
UH, AND TO BE FRANK,

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.630
I AM KIND OF FED UP
WITH THIS WHOLE SITUATION.

01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:12.260
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
RIGHT NOW.

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:14.850
HIS REPORT CARD...

01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:16.720
IT'S FAKED.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.810
RIGHT?

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.730
- MM, MM, MM.
NO, NO.

01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:31.200
THIS--THIS LOOKS RIGHT TO ME.
[chuckles nervously]

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.950
- WHAT?

01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:37.410
FELIX HAS BEEN DOING...

01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:41.080
REMARKABLY WELL
HERE AT EASTWOOD.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.710
- REALLY?

01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.840
- AND HE'S--
HE'S BEEN PARTICIPATING

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:49.460
IN MANY...

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:52.510
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES.

01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:56.180
- LIKE THE SCHOOL PLAY, RIGHT?

01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.010
- OH, THE SCHOOL PLAY--

01:21:58.010 --> 01:22:01.980
HE WAS JUST WONDERFUL
AT THE SCHOOL PLAY.

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:04.980
[rock music]

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:09.280
*

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.820
- TRUMAN SIGNED THE PAPERS,
AND THREE DAYS LATER,

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.320
I WAS OFFICIALLY RE-ENROLLED
HERE AT EASTWOOD HIGH...

01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:19.950
WITH A FEW EXTRA BENEFITS.

01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:22.370
[playing xylophone]

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.500
- CAN WE MAKE THIS A DUET?

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.380
- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.960
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.800
- NEEDLESS TO SAY,

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.600
LOOKS LIKE THIS IS GONNA BE
MY BEST YEAR YET.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.430
[indistinct conversations]

01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:44.060
- OH, SORRY. HEY.

01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:48.150
STOP STALKING ME.

01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:50.570
- YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.
- SEE YOU AROUND...

01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:51.860
IF YOU'RE LUCKY.

01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:02.910
THE SHORTEST DEFINITION
OF A GAME IS AS FOLLOWS--

01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:05.960
A COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY
WITH A FIXED SET OF RULES.

01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:10.500
THERE'S A POINT SYSTEM.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.510
THERE ARE WINNERS.

01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:14.760
THERE ARE LOSERS.

01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:18.890
THERE ARE ALLIES...

01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:21.100
AND OPPONENTS.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.560
HIGH SCHOOL IS A GAME.

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.020
