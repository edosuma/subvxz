36:21.596 --> 36:23.763
A door was open.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.019
If anyone's stubborn enough to do it...

36:30.771 --> 36:31.855
...it'd be him.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.612
Where do you think he is now?

36:40.865 --> 36:42.616
I don't know.

36:44.577 --> 36:47.495
I kind of can't believe it, Dean. I mean--

36:48.331 --> 36:53.543
Our whole lives, everything,
has been prepping for this. And now, I--

36:57.131 --> 36:59.299
I kind of don't know what to say.

37:02.511 --> 37:04.137
I do.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.398
That was for our mom.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.735
You son of a bitch.

37:27.703 --> 37:31.248
You know, when Jake saw me
it was like he saw a ghost.

37:36.128 --> 37:38.421
I mean, hell, you heard him, Dean.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.091
He said he killed me.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.511
Glad he was wrong.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.513
I don't think he was, Dean.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.059
What happened?

37:51.227 --> 37:52.227
After I was stabbed?

37:54.438 --> 37:56.398
-I already told you.
-Not everything.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.694
Sam, we just killed the demon.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.906
Can we celebrate for a minute?

38:09.578 --> 38:10.704
Did I die?

38:10.871 --> 38:12.539
Oh, come on.

38:13.165 --> 38:15.542
Did you sell your soul for me?
Like Dad did for you?

38:15.710 --> 38:17.210
Come on. No.

38:21.590 --> 38:22.590
Tell me the truth.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.847
-Dean, tell me the truth.
-Sam.

38:38.941 --> 38:39.941
How long you get?

38:46.073 --> 38:47.073
One year.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.661
I got one year.

38:54.248 --> 38:55.832
You shouldn't have done that.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.753
-How could you do that?
-Don't get mad at me.

39:01.088 --> 39:02.422
Don't you do that.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.259
I had to.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.179
I had to look out for you.

39:09.597 --> 39:12.265
-That's my job.
-And what do you think my job is?

39:12.850 --> 39:17.604
-What?
-You saved my life over and over.

39:17.772 --> 39:21.733
I mean, you sacrifice everything for me.
Don't you think I'd do the same for you?

39:23.861 --> 39:25.612
You're my big brother.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.157
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

39:33.412 --> 39:36.456
And I don't care what it takes.
I'm gonna get you out of this.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.878
Guess I gotta save your ass for a change.

39:43.130 --> 39:44.631
Yeah.

39:45.424 --> 39:46.925
ELLEN:
Well...

39:47.343 --> 39:50.970
...Yellow-Eyed Demon might be dead
but a lot more got through that gate.

39:51.138 --> 39:52.889
How many you think?

39:53.057 --> 39:54.391
A hundred.

39:54.558 --> 39:57.560
Maybe 200. It's an army.

39:58.437 --> 40:00.230
He's unleashed an army.

40:02.858 --> 40:05.026
Hope to hell you boys are ready.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.694
Because the war's just begun.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.157
Well, then...

40:20.084 --> 40:22.335
...we got work to do.
