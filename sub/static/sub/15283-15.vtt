HOW CAN YOU BE MARRIED TO ONE AND NOT KNOW?

01:02.600 --> 01:05.099
THERESA, WOULD YOU MIND CALLING UP MY CAR SERVICE?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.200
NOT AT ALL.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.900
UH, YOU'LL EXCUSE ME?
-SURE.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.600
AGENT ROSSI.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.200
HI.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.300
HI. I'M A BIG FAN.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.800
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A QUIZ.
I SAW YOU TAKING NOTES.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.100
OH, NO, IT'S JUST FOR MY OWN EDIFICATION.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.500
AGENT ROSSI, ARE YOU OR ANYONE IN YOUR DEPARTMENT

01:21.500 --> 01:24.200
INVESTIGATING THE RECENT SPIKE IN HOMICIDES IN CLEVELAND?

01:24.200 --> 01:25.800
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.100
THERE'S BEEN AN UPTICK IN HOMICIDES
BY 11% THIS QUARTER,

01:29.100 --> 01:33.500
THE AVERAGE UPTICK
HASN'T SURPASSED 5% IN THE PAST 10 YEARS N CLEVELAND 

01:33.500 --> 01:35.400
I'M GUESSING YOU'RE STUDYING CRIMINOLOGY.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.600
I AM. 

01:37.700 --> 01:40.800
SIR, I THINK THERE'S A SERIAL KILLER HERE.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.200
WELL, HAVE THE POLICE ISSUED A STATEMENT TO CORROBORATE THAT?

01:44.200 --> 01:45.900
I FILED AN INQUIRY DOWNTOWN.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.800
UM, NOBODY'S CALLED ME BACK.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.600
BUT, UH, I KNOW THAT THE CORONER'S OFFICE

01:49.600 --> 01:51.200
HASN'T BEEN AS BUSY SINCE, LIKE,

01:51.200 --> 01:53.900
THE BUTCHER OF KINGSBURY RUN IN THE 1930s.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.100
WELL, WHAT KIND OF HOMICIDES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

01:56.100 --> 01:58.500
OK, UM...A MAN WAS SHOT IN A PARK,

01:58.500 --> 02:00.900
A PROSTITUTE WAS FOUND WITH HER THROAT SLASHED,

02:00.900 --> 02:03.300
A COUPLE WAS FOUND SHOT IN THEIR CAR,

02:03.300 --> 02:05.600
A WOMAN WAS KILLED IN A BURGLARY.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.400
DO YOU KNOW WHAT 3 THINGS PROFILERS LOOK AT TO LINK SERIAL CRIMES?

02:09.400 --> 02:11.800
VICTIMOLOGY, MODUS OPERANDI, AND SIGNATURE.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.000
GOOD. SO WERE THE VICTIMS SIMILAR?

02:14.000 --> 02:14.700
NO.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.500
WAS THE M.O. CONSISTENT?
-NO

02:16.500 --> 02:18.800
WAS THE SIGNATURE CONSISTENT?

02:18.800 --> 02:19.900
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.600
THEN THERE'S NO OBVIOUS REASON TO SUGGEST THAT 

02:21.600 --> 02:24.900
THE SPIKE
IN VIOLENCE WAS DUE TO A SERIAL KILLER.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.200
I SEE YOUR POINT, SIR, BUT I REALLY--

02:27.200 --> 02:29.600

WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS?

04:20.899 --> 04:23.800
817 TIVOLI. IT'S RIGHT DOWN THAT WAY.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.900
LOOK, IF I WAS GONNA HURT YOU,

04:25.900 --> 04:28.300
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID "EXCUSE ME." OK?

04:30.200 --> 04:32.000
ARE WE COOL?

04:36.200 --> 04:38.500
WHAT THE HELL, MAN? YOU SCARED ME.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.100
I WAS JUST WALKING HOME
FROM THE LIQUOR STORE

04:45.100 --> 04:46.900
AND I SAW YOU SNOOPING AROUND.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.200
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

04:48.500 --> 04:50.300
SO YOU HEARD WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

04:50.900 --> 04:52.100
YEAH.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.300
POOR WOMAN.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.300
ALL THE NEIGHBORS ARE FREAKING OUT.

04:56.300 --> 04:58.800
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.500
KAYLA JAMES.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.800
SHE WAS RAPED, TOO.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.100
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED ON MY STREET.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.000
NO, IT'S NOT JUST YOUR STREET.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.400
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MURDERS LATELY.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.200
REALLY?

05:12.900 --> 05:15.900
YEAH, IT'S UNCHARACTERISTICALLY HIGH FOR OUR CITY.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.000
YOU WITH THE POLICE OR SOMETHING?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.100
I'M JUST INVESTIGATING A FEW CASES.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.900

WALKING HER DOG THIS MORNING.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.100
DOG WOULDN'T STOP BARKING.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.200
I JUST TALKED TO HER LAST NIGHT.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.900
I NEVER ASKED HER NAME.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.300
ZOE HAWKES.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.900
THAT'S HER CAR RIGHT THERE.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.300
THESE KEYS WERE STILL IN HER POCKET.

07:19.300 --> 07:22.000
CAR ALARM WAS STILL ACTIVATED.
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A BREAK-IN.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.500
SHE HAD PEPPER SPRAY BUT DIDN'T USE IT?

07:24.700 --> 07:26.500
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SHE DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.400
NOBODY SAW OR HEARD ANYTHING?

07:28.400 --> 07:30.900
NO. WE WENT DOOR TO DOOR.
THERE WERE NO WITNESSES.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.300
THERE WAS BLUNT-FORCE TRAUMA TO HER HEAD,

07:32.300 --> 07:34.000
SIGNS OF STRANGULATION.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.100
MURDERER ASPHYXIATED HER 
WITH THE SCARF SHE WAS WEARING

07:37.100 --> 07:40.200

SNOOPING AROUND THIS CASE?

07:40.300 --> 07:43.400
YOU KEEP TALKING LIKE I KNOW SOMETHING. WHAT CASE?

07:43.500 --> 07:45.000
THE RESIDENT OF THIS HOUSE, KAYLA JAMES,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.800
WAS MURDERED AND RAPED 3 DAYS AGO IN A BURGLARY-HOMICIDE.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.700
I THINK THERE'S A SERIAL KILLER HERE.

07:49.700 --> 07:53.000

07:53.000 --> 07:54.300

07:56.800 --> 07:59.100
THIS IS HENRY WEARING THE BOOTIES MY MOM KNITTED HIM.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.500
I CAN'T GET OVER HIS CUTENESS.

08:01.900 --> 08:05.700
OH, AND THIS IS HIM WEARING THE CUSTOMIZED LEATHER JACKET

08:05.700 --> 08:07.700
AUNTIE PENELOPE GOT HIM.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.800

08:36.600 --> 08:38.500
SHE HAD A NOTEBOOK WITH HER LAST NIGHT.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.000
I SAW ONE IN HER CAR.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.500
CAN I TAKE A LOOK?

08:41.500 --> 08:44.100
IT MAY BE EVIDENCE, BUT I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.200
HAVE YOU BEEN TO HER HOUSE YET?

08:46.300 --> 08:47.700

09:23.800 --> 09:26.100
THAT--THAT'S--THAT'S ONE OF HER JOURNALS.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.700
HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED?

09:28.900 --> 09:30.300
YES.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.900
SHE WAS MURDERED.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.300
I AM SO SORRY.:MRS. HAWKES.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.900
OH, NO!

09:40.900 --> 09:43.300
NO

09:44.400 --> 09:46.000
WHERE DID YOU FIND HER?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.600
SHE WAS IN A HOUSE IN EAST CLEVELAND.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.800
WE THINK SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
VISITING A CRIME SCENE.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.600
GOD...

09:54.800 --> 09:57.100
I TOLD HER TO STOP DOING THAT.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.100
I TOLD HER THAT WASTOO DANGEROUS.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.200
WHERE--WHERE IS SHE NOW?

10:03.200 --> 10:04.700
SHE'S AT THE CORONER'S OFFICE,

10:04.700 --> 10:06.300
AND I CAN TAKE YOU TO SEE HER WHEN YOU'RE READY.

10:06.300 --> 10:07.500
OK. NOW.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.500
RIGHT NOW. I HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW.

10:10.200 --> 10:14.200
MRS. HAWKES, WOULD YOU MIND IF I STAYED BEHIND TO LOOK IN HER ROOM?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
SHE WAS SO EXCITED TO MEET YOU.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.500
YOU'RE LIKE A... A HERO TO HER.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.800
MRS. HAWKES.LET ME TAKE YOU DOWNTOWN NOW.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.400
COME ON.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.300
I'LL, UH, I'LL SEND A CAR FOR YOU.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.300
THE CRIMES ARE WITHIN A 7-MILE RADIUS.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.200
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.000
YEAH, BUT THE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.800
THEY RANGE FROM POOR TO RICH, INDUSTRIAL TO RESIDENTIAL.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.300
THE PHYSICAL LOCATIONS ARE DISSIMILAR,

11:41.300 --> 11:43.300
BUT THE OPERATING ZONE'S WELL-DEFINED.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.700
OK. I'M IN.

11:44.700 --> 11:45.700
I SEE YOU.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.900
IN YOUR WEB BROWSER FOR SEARCH HISTORY.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.100
CHECK OUT HER HOME PAGE.

11:50.100 --> 11:53.600
ALL RIGHT, SO THE FIRST THING SHE LOOKS AT

11:53.600 --> 11:55.100
PROBABLY TO STAY CURRENT ON HER STUDIES.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.200
CAN YOU SEE WHAT SHE WORKED ON LAST?

11:58.400 --> 11:59.300
VOILA.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.700
THESE ARE THE MOST RECENTLY
OPENED DOCUMENTS SHE CREATED.

12:01.700 --> 12:06.300
Reid: LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS COMPILING EMPIRICAL DATA
ABOUT HOMICIDE TRENDS IN CLEVELAND.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.000
DO YOU THINK SHE KNEW THE KILLER?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.300
I DON'T SEE ANY NOTES INDICATING SUSPECTS.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.900
Hotch: WELL, DAVE, SHE'S A CRIMINOLOGY STUDENT.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.600
SHE'S BEEN TAUGHT TO ANALYZE STATISTICS AND APPLY THEORY,

12:14.600 --> 12:16.000
NOT INVESTIGATE KILLERS.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.600
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.100
ALL RIGHT. VICTIM ONE-- TRAVIS BARTLETT 

12:20.100 --> 12:22.200
WAS LAST SEEN AT A GAY BAR. 

12:22.200 --> 12:23.800
HE WAS SHOT AT NIGHT IN A PARK.

12:23.800 --> 12:27.500
VICTIM 2, LILY NICKS, A 34-YEAR-OLD PROSTITUTE,

12:27.500 --> 12:28.900
HER THROAT WAS SLASHED.

12:28.900 --> 12:30.400
VICTIMS 3 AND 4,

12:30.400 --> 12:32.200
JUNE APPLEBY AND TROY WERTSLER,

12:32.200 --> 12:35.300
WERE SHOT IN THEIR CAR AT A PARKING LOT
OUTSIDE OF A MOVIE THEATER.

12:35.300 --> 12:38.700
AND VICTIM 5 WAS A 28-YEAR-OLD SINGLE WOMAN,

12:38.700 --> 12:40.900
KAYLA JAMES, KILLED IN HER HOME.

12:40.900 --> 12:44.200
SHE WAS BOUND, SUFFOCATED WITH A BAG OVER HER HEAD,

12:44.200 --> 12:45.300
EVIDENCE OF RAPE.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.800
 AND THEN THE SIXTH VICTIM WAS ZOE.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.900
VICTIMOLOGY, WEAPONS USED, AND C.O.D.ARE ALL DIFFERENT.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.300
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE IT'S EVEN THE SAME UNSUB.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.000
IT CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE

12:55.000 --> 12:57.900
THAT ZOE GOES TO KAYLA JAMES'
HOUSE AND GETS MURDERED.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.800
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SAY IT IS THE SAME KILLER.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.200
DOES ANYBODY SEE A PATTERN?

13:01.200 --> 13:02.800
WELL, MAYBE.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.900
OK, THE FIRST CRIME, HE SHOOTS THE VICTIM.

13:05.900 --> 13:08.600
THE SECOND CRIME, HE RAPES A WOMAN AND SLASHES HER THROAT.

13:08.600 --> 13:09.900
THAT'S MORE PERSONAL.

13:09.900 --> 13:13.200
AND THE THIRD CRIME, HE ESCALATES TO KILLING TWO PEOPLE,

13:13.200 --> 13:15.500
AND THE FOURTH, HE ESCALATES EVEN MORE

13:15.500 --> 13:18.200
BY RAPING A WOMAN, BINDING HER, AND SUFFOCATING HER.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.400
SO IF IT IS THE SAME UNSUB,

13:19.400 --> 13:22.400
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THERE'S
A PROGRESSION OF VIOLENCE WITH EVERY KILL.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.800
IT COULD BE AN ANGER EXCITATION OFFENDER

13:24.800 --> 13:26.800
GETTING MORE DARING WITH EACH CRIME.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.100
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING HERE.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.400
LOOK

13:30.300 --> 13:32.400
THE SLASHES IN THE PROSTITUTE'S THROAT--

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
THEY'RE ALL SHALLOW, UNSURE CUTS.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.100
THE KAYLA JAMES CRIME SCENE--

13:38.600 --> 13:42.200
TELEPHONE CORD, ROPE, AND DUCT TAPE WERE USED.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.200
IT LIKE HE COULDN'T DECIDE HOW TO BIND HER.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.800
SO WITHOUT A GUN,

13:45.900 --> 13:48.000
HE'S SLOPPY, INEXPERIENCED.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
THE YOUNG COUPLE SHOT IN THE CAR...

13:51.800 --> 13:53.300
THAT CRIME SCENE REMIND YOU OF ANYTHING?

13:53.300 --> 13:55.100
YEAH, THEY WERE SHOT WITH A .44 BULLDOG,

13:55.100 --> 13:56.900
JUST LIKE THE SON OF SAM USED ON HIS VICTIMS,

13:56.900 --> 14:00.400
WHICH WERE ALSO YOUNG COUPLES IN PARKED CARS.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.100
IT MIGHT BE NOTHING,BUT YOU'RE RIGHT,THERE IS A PARALLEL THERE.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.700
WITH THE SECOND VICTIM,IT'S HARD NOT TO THINK OF JACK THE RIPPER.

14:06.900 --> 14:11.100
THE OBVIOUS SIMILARITY BEING IT'S A PROSTITUTE
WHOSE THROAT WAS SLASHED.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.900
KAYLA JAMES WAS BOUND, TORTURED, RAPED,

14:14.900 --> 14:17.700
WITH A PLASTIC BAG OVER HER HEAD LIKE BTK.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.000
WHAT ABOUT VICTIM NUMBER ONE?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.200
GARCIA, WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD WAS HE FOUND IN?

14:25.200 --> 14:27.900
AT A PARK IN THE KINGSBURY RUN AREA.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.100
ZOE REMINDED ME LAST NIGHT

14:30.100 --> 14:35.300
THAT CLEVELAND'S MOST FAMOUS SERIAL KILLER
WAS THE BUTCHER OF KINGSBURY RUN.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.600
HE FOUND HIS VICTIMS IN GAY BARS, SHOT THEM,

14:38.600 --> 14:40.400
AND DUMPED THEIR BODY THERE.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.800
TRAVIS BARTLETT WAS LAST SEEN AT A GAY BAR,

14:44.100 --> 14:47.100
AND HIS BODY WAS FOUND IN KINGSBURY PARK.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.200
SO THESE ARE COPYCATS OF FAMOUS SERIAL KILLERS?

14:52.200 --> 14:56.100
HE'S A SERIAL KILLER STUDYING SERIAL KILLERS.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.100
Hotch: SEE YOU IN CLEVELAND, DAVE.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.600
HEY, DAVE. GUYS.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.000
WE'RE IN THAT ROOM. COFFEE'S BREWING.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.700
WE'LL GET STARTED ON THE EVIDENCE BOARDS.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.400
DETECTIVE BRADY'S OUR POINT.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.200
I'LL LET YOU ALL INTRODUCE YOURSELVES.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.600
JJ.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.800
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT WITH SOMETHING?

15:56.900 --> 15:57.700
SURE.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.300
THIS HAS TO BE CONFIDENTIAL.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.400
Hotch: I KNOW IT MAY SEEM FARFETCHED,

16:05.400 --> 16:08.000
BUT COPYCAT KILLERS ARE NOT ENTIRELY UNCOMMON.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.200
THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE COPYING SEVERAL DIFFERENT KILLERS.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.800
BUT IF HE'S TRYING TO BE THE BUTCHER OF KINGSBURY RUN,

16:11.800 --> 16:14.100
WHY DIDN'T HE CUT UP AND MUTILATE THE VICTIMS LIKE THE REAL GUY?

16:14.100 --> 16:15.400
THAT WAS 7 WEEKS AGO.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.500
HE WAS JUST GETTING STARTED.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.700
BEGINNING KILLERS ARE OFTEN FRIGHTENED OF THE CRIME ITSELF.

16:19.700 --> 16:22.300
THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED IN GETTING IT OVER WITH AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

16:22.300 --> 16:23.600
AND FLEEING THE SCENE.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.000
HE WAS JUST USING THE BUTCHER'S RUSE
AS A WAY TO LURE THE VICTIM TO BE ALONE WITH HER.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.100
AND BY THE TIME HE KILLED KAYLA JAMES 3 DAYS AGO,

16:29.100 --> 16:30.000
HE'D PROGRESSED. 

16:30.000 --> 16:32.400
HE CAME VERY CLOSE TO COPYING ALL OF THE BTK's M.O.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.200
HE'S READING, LEARNING, BORROWING FROM OTHERS

16:35.200 --> 16:37.000
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE IS YET.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.700
AND BECAUSE OF THIS, WE THINK HE'S YOUNG AND IMPRESSIONABLE,

16:38.700 --> 16:39.800
MAYBE EVEN A STUDENT.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.900
SOMEONE PROBABLY ENROLLED IN CRIMINOLOGY CLASSES.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.400
OUR TECHNICAL ANALYST IS GOING THROUGH NAMES
OF LOCAL STUDENTS RIGHT NOW.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.300
UP TO THIS POINT, CHANGING HIS M.O.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.200
HAS PREVENTED INVESTIGATORS
FROM LINKING THE CRIMES.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.000
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO WORK QUICKLY.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THIS?

16:52.000 --> 16:52.800
IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE 

16:52.800 --> 16:55.900
THAT ALL OF THESE RANDOM,VIOLENT MURDERS IN A LOCALIZED AREA

16:55.900 --> 16:57.800
ARE COPYCATS OF SERIAL KILLERS.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.700
IT'S AS IF ALL THE WORST SERIAL KILLERS

16:59.700 --> 17:00.900
HAVE CONVERGED ON CLEVELAND.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.100
 EVERY TIME HE PLANS TO KILL

17:02.100 --> 17:05.500
THE MURDER WEAPON, THE M.O., AND THE VICTIMOLOGY WILL ALL CHANGE.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.400
DETECTIVE, WILL YOU LET YOUR TEAM KNOW

17:36.400 --> 17:37.900
WE'RE READY TO GIVE A PRELIMINARY PROFILE.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.700
SURE. I GOTTA GO.

17:39.700 --> 17:42.500
HOTCH. I'M GONNA STEP OUT FOR THIS ONE,

17:42.500 --> 17:43.900
CLEAR MY HEAD.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.200
OK.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.500
GARCIA FOUND 3 MALE STUDENTS
ENROLLED IN CRIMINOLOGY CLASSES WITH FELONY RECORDS.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.500
GOOD. WE'LL INTERVIEW THEM.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.700
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.000
ONE OF THEM IS STUDYING ABROAD,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.300
THE OTHER 2 ARE BACK IN JAIL ON OTHER CHARGES.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
TELL GARCIA TO CHECK ENROLLMENT IN ONLINE

17:59.000 --> 17:59.900
AND CORRESPONDENCE COURSES,

17:59.900 --> 18:02.400
SEE IF WE HAVE ANY LUCK WITH THOSE PARAMETERS

18:07.400 --> 18:09.500
YOU GUYS HANDLE THE PROFILE?

18:09.900 --> 18:10.800
YEAH. EVERYTHING OK?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.000
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

18:13.100 --> 18:16.000
WE HAVE 6 HOMICIDES IN A 7-MILE RADIUS IN EAST CLEVELAND.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.500
NOW, THIS SMALL ZONE INDICATES

18:17.500 --> 18:19.800
THAT'S HE'S A GEOGRAPHICALLY STABLE OFFENDER.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.600
THIS TYPE OF OFFENDER IS CHARACTERIZED AS YOUNG,

18:22.600 --> 18:25.000
SOCIALLY IMMATURE, OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.200
WITH PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY TRAITS.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.000
THEY ALSO USUALLY LIVE ALONE
AND HAVE AN ANTISOCIAL NATURE.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.500
A SERIAL KILLER'S FIRST MURDER IS VERY TELLING.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.700
THIS UNSUB'S FIRST MURDER, 

18:33.700 --> 18:37.400
HE CHOSE THE M.O.
OF CLEVELAND'S OWN BUTCHER OF KINGSBURY RUN.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.900
THE BUTCHER ISN'T AS WELL KNOWN AS OTHER FAMOUS SERIAL KILLERS,

18:39.900 --> 18:42.200
BUT HE IS A LOCAL LEGEND.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.600
AND BECAUSE HE PICKED THE BUTCHER TO BE FIRST,

18:43.600 --> 18:45.400
WE BELIEVE HE'S A NATIVE OF CLEVELAND

18:45.400 --> 18:47.600
AND PROBABLY GREW UP HEARING STORIES OF THE BUTCHER.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.900
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS OBSESSED WITH SERIAL KILLERS.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.900
HIS COMPUTER WILL BE FILLED WITH RESEARCH ON THEM.

18:51.900 --> 18:54.500
HE'LL HAVE ABUNDANT IMAGES
OF MURDERERS ON HIS COMPUTER

18:54.500 --> 18:56.500
AND POSSIBLY EVEN SNUFF FILMS.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.500
HE USES THESE LIKE PORNOGRAPHY.

18:58.500 --> 19:02.100
THE PROVIDE SOME SORT OF SEXUAL RELEASE.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.400
I THINK HE WENT BACK TO RELIVE HIS CRIME.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.400
WHEN ZOE SHOWED UP, SHE BECAME A VICTIM OF OPPORTUNITY.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.800
IT'S THE SAME THEORY WE ARRIVED AT ON THE PLANE.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.600
HE STRANGLED HER WITH HER OWN SCARF.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.200
HE DIDN'T PLAN IT. I THINK SHE SURPRISED HIM.

19:31.500 --> 19:36.100
I TOLD HER NOT TO STOP UNTIL SHE FOUND THE ANSWERS SHE WAS LOOKING FOR.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.600
I DIDN'T THINK SHE WOULD GO TO A CRIME SCENE.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.600
HER MOM SAID IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHE DOES ALL THE TIME.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.500
SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GONE ANYWAY.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.200
BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT I SAID

19:45.200 --> 19:47.600
THAT SHE WAS ENCOURAGED TO GO THERE LAST NIGHT.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.300
DAVE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:49.400 --> 19:52.200
SHE CAME TO ME AND I DISMISSED HER.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.500
TRY NOT TO PERSONALIZE IT.

19:55.200 --> 19:59.000
I WAS THE LAST ONE SHE TALKED TO BEFORE SHE WAS MURDERED.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.500
HOW IS THIS NOT PERSONAL, AARON?

20:02.700 --> 20:03.800
OK.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.400
IT'S PERSONAL.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.100
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
HOW WE GO ABOUT FINDING HER KILLER.

20:11.900 --> 20:15.800
WE KNOW THAT VIOLENT CRIMINALS DEVELOP A SIGNATURE
OVER A SERIES OF CRIMES

20:15.800 --> 20:19.100
IF HE'S YOUNG, HE PROBABLY
HASN'T EVEN FIGURED OUT WHAT HIS IS YET.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.400
FIND THE SIGNATURE, WE CAN LINK THE CRIMES.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.000
HE PROBABLY MONITORING THE NEWS, 

20:25.000 --> 20:26.900
SEEING IF THE POLICE
HAVE CONNECTED THEM YET.

20:26.900 --> 20:29.300
WE CAN USE THAT. WE CAN UTILIZE THE MEDIA.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.800
AND I THINK I KNOW WHO WE CAN TALK TO.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.500
I KNEW HOMICIDES WERE UP,

20:44.500 --> 20:47.200
BUT NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER.

20:47.500 --> 20:51.100
WHY DO I GET A VISIT FROM THE B.A.U.?

20:51.100 --> 20:52.400
YOU'RE PAULA McCONNELL,

20:52.400 --> 20:54.200
CLEVELAND'S NUMBER ONE SOURCE IN CRIME NEWS.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.100
YOU'RE DETAILED, YOU HAVE A FOLLOWING.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.300
HE'S READING YOU.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.600
WE NEED YOU TO WRITE
THAT THE POLICE HAVE FOUND HIS SIGNATURE.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.200
YOU CAN HELP US BY EXPLAINING WHAT HIS SIGNATURE IS
IN YOUR ARTICLE.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.500
IT'S A KILLER'S PERSONAL STAMP,

21:04.500 --> 21:07.800
HIS DISTINCTIVE TOUCH THAT HE LEAVES AT THE SCENE OF EVERY CRIME.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.800
WELL, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 18 YEARS.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.300
AND I KNOW WHAT A SIGNATURE IS, HONEY.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.500
WE JUST REALLY NEED YOU
TO BE DETAILED ABOUT THIS.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.200
WE'RE SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO HIM.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
THROUGH MY COLUMN.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.500
HE'S DOING SOMETHING,

21:21.500 --> 21:24.400
A BEHAVIORAL IMPULSE HE FEELS COMPELLED TO DO.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.700
BUT A NEED-DRIVEN ACT TO GET A SEXUAL RELEASE

21:27.700 --> 21:29.900
THAT'S SPECIFIC TO HIS PSYCHE.
406PETECHIAE
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,200
THIS REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR AT EACH CRIME SCENE
WILL LEAD US TO HIM.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.000
LET ME TAKE A STAB AT IT.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.100
YEAH, REID.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.300
UH, THEY JUST FOUND ANOTHER BODY.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.400
THEY'RE BRINGING HIM UP RIGHT NOW.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.700
TEENAGERS FOUND HIM A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR AGO.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.800
IT'S PETECHIAE IN THE WHITES OF HIS EYES.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.100
JUDGING FROM THE BRUISING,

22:00.100 --> 22:01.900
HE WAS PROBABLY STRANGLED WITH A WIRE.

22:02.300 --> 22:03.200
IS THIS OUR GUY?

22:03.200 --> 22:05.700
IT'S GOTTA BE.A JOGGER DOESN'T GET GARROTED EVERY DAY.

22:05.800 --> 22:09.000
WHATEVER SIGNATURE HE LEFT
WAS PROBABLY WASHED AWAY IN THE WATER.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.900
WELL, WHO'S HE MIMICKING NOW?

22:10.900 --> 22:13.900
BIKE PATH RAPIST ALTEMIO SANCHEZ COMES TO MIND.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.200
HE TROLLED BIKE PATHS NEAR BUFFALO GARROTING HIS VICTIMS.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.900
IT LOOKS LIKE HE COPIED
EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE RAPE.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
STRANGULATION'S A REPETITION OF HIS LAST MURDER OF ZOE.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.900
FIRST TIME HE'S REPEATED HIMSELF. 

22:23.900 --> 22:25.600
ZOE'S MURDER WAS SPONTANEOUS, THOUGH.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.900
HE DIDN'T PLAN IT. HE ACTED ON INSTINCT
AND DID WHAT CAME NATURALLY TO HIM.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.300
MAYBE WHAT CAME NATURALLY FELT GOOD  HIM

22:30.300 --> 22:31.600
AND HE WANTED TO FEEL IT AGAIN

22:31.600 --> 22:33.300
IF HE'S STARTING TO REPEAT A PATTERN,

22:33.300 --> 22:35.300
HE MAY HAVE FOUND HIMSELF.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.200
?????????

22:53.200 --> 22:54.600
????????????

23:02.100 --> 23:04.200
ZOE HAWKES.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.600
H-A-W-K-E-S.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.200
VERY GOOD.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.600
I'M DANNY.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.700
I WANT YOU TO CALL US 

23:12.700 --> 23:15.000
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.200
WE'RE GONNA TAKE GREAT CARE OF HER

23:18.200 --> 23:19.200
OK?

23:20.300 --> 23:21.300
YOU'RE ALL SET.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.300
UM, DO I PAY THE BILL HERE?

23:23.900 --> 23:27.600
NO, MA'AM. THE BILL'S BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BY AN ANONYMOUS DONOR.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.300
Rossi: SEE ANYTHING ELSE IN THERE?

23:34.300 --> 23:37.000
JUST THE NOTATIONS OF AN OBSERVANT STUDENT.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.100
I'VE BEEN THINKING, THOUGH.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.600
ZOE GOT ALL OF HER INFORMATION
FROM THE NEWSPAPERS

23:41.600 --> 23:43.200
AND FROM PAULA McCONNELL'SCOLUMN. 

23:43.200 --> 23:46.300
THERE'S NO WAY SHE COULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT EVERY HOMICIDE IN THE CITY.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.200
WELL, NOT EVERY HOMICIDE'S REPORTED IN THE PAPERS.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.900
SO HOW DO WE KNOW THE UNSUB
DIDN'T COMMIT MORE MURDERS

23:49.900 --> 23:51.400
THAN THE ONES NOTED IN HER JOURNALS?

23:51.400 --> 23:52.800
WE DON'T.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.300
WE CAN CHECK MISSING PERSONS 

23:54.300 --> 23:57.900
AND SEE IF ANYONE WAS LAST SEEN IN THE UNSUB'S OPERATING ZONE.

24:01.000 --> 24:01.600
WHAT?

24:01.600 --> 24:04.300
WELL, A YOUNG PERSON'S MIND IS SO ACTIVE--

24:04.300 --> 24:07.700
YOURS, ZOE'S, AND I IMAGINE THIS UNSUB'S, TOO.

24:07.700 --> 24:10.000
I THINK WHEN HE GET HIM, HE'LL BE CURIOUS.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.500
HE'LL ASK QUESTIONS.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.700
ROSSI, HEADS UP. SHE KNOWS.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.200
DID YOU DO THIS?

24:18.400 --> 24:22.200
I DON'T NEED OR WANT YOUR MONEY.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.700
I HAVE TAKEN CARE OF MY DAUGHTER FOR 22 YEARS,

24:25.700 --> 24:28.000
AND SHE IS STILL MY RESPONSIBILITY.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.700
I DON'T NEED ANY HELP FROM YOU.

24:32.900 --> 24:35.200
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.400
I'M SORRY IF I'VE OFFENDED YOU.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.900
JUST LEAVE US ALONE.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.100
ALL RIGHT.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.500
WE FOUND ANOTHER BODY.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.000
EAST CLEVELAND.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.700
STRANGULATION MARKS.

24:57.500 --> 24:58.700
Reid: THIS WAS RECENT.

24:58.700 --> 25:01.300
THE BRUISES ON HER NECK ARE STILL REDDISH.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.500
NO OTHER OBVIOUS SIGNS OF TRAUMA.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.900
WELL, THIS ISN'T A BIKE PATH LIKE THE LAST ONE.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.900
WHICH SERIAL KILLER IS HE MIMICKING NOW?

25:07.900 --> 25:09.700
I DON'T THINK HE IS MIMICKING ANYMORE.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.700
HE'S STARTING TO SHOW CONSISTENCY.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.700
I THINK HE'S DEVELOPING HIS OWN STYLE.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.000
HAS ANYBODY TOUCHED HER?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.400
NO. THEY HAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO WAIT FOR US AND THE M.E.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.500
WHERE'S HE?

25:18.700 --> 25:20.100
DR. EDWARDS!

25:21.900 --> 25:23.200
HERE HE COMES.

25:24.800 --> 25:25.900
HI. AGENT HOTCHNER.

25:25.900 --> 25:28.600
UM, COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS SPOT ON HER FOREHEAD?

25:30.900 --> 25:32.200
HMM. THAT'S STRANGE.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.500
LET ME SWAB IT AND GET IT BACK TO THE LAB.
THX

25:38.100 --> 25:39.400
3 MURDERS IN THE LAST 3 DAYS.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.300
SOMETHING'S CAUSING HIS FRENZY.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.300
COULD BE A DRASTIC CHANGE IN HIS LIFE.

25:43.300 --> 25:45.500
SOMETHING HE LOST CONTROL OF.

25:45.500 --> 25:49.100
OR IT COULD BE SOMETHING HE GAINED CONTROL OF.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.700
LIKE HIMSELF.

25:50.700 --> 25:54.200
IF HE'S FINALLY DEFINED HIMSELF AS A STRANGLER

25:54.200 --> 25:57.200
HE MAY JUST BE PRACTICING, PERFECTING HIS STYLE.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.000
HE MAY HAVE AWAKENED.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.700
THE CORONER JUST CALLED.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.800
PRELIMINARY TESTS CONFIRM ACETYL ALCOHOL

26:02.800 --> 26:04.600
ON THE HOMELESS WOMAN'S FOREHEAD.

26:04.600 --> 26:05.900
HE STERILIZED IT?

26:05.900 --> 26:07.600
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

26:07.700 --> 26:09.600
MAYBE HE DID SOMETHING TO HER FOREHEAD,

26:09.600 --> 26:11.600
USED AN ALCOHOL WIPE TO REMOVE EVIDENCE.

26:11.600 --> 26:12.800
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, 

26:12.800 --> 26:14.700
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T NECESSARY TO THE CRIME.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.800
THIS COULD BE PART OF HIS SIGNATURE.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.000
WE SHOULD LOOK AT OTHER VICTIMS

26:18.000 --> 26:19.700
TO SEE IF HE DID SOMETHING SIMILAR.

26:19.700 --> 26:22.800
ANY EVIDENCE ON THE LAST VICTIM
WAS WASHED AWAY IN THE WATER.

26:22.800 --> 26:25.300
AND ALL THE OTHER BODIES 
WERE EITHER BURIED OR CREMATED.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.600
EXCEPT FOR ONE.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.000
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME,

26:39.000 --> 26:40.500
BUT PLEASE HEAR ME OUT. 

26:40.500 --> 26:43.600
WE NEED ZOE'S BODY
TO GO BACK TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE.

26:43.600 --> 26:46.300
ZOE'S MURDERER LEFT A CLUE ON HER BODY.

26:46.300 --> 26:49.300
THERE'S A CHANCE WE CAN FIND HIM FROM THIS CLUE,

26:49.300 --> 26:51.300
BUT WE HAVE TO EXAMINE HER AGAIN.

26:51.300 --> 26:54.500
ALL I WANT TO DO IS PUT HER TO REST.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.600
ZOE CHOSE TO STUDY CRIMINOLOGY

26:57.600 --> 27:01.000
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED
IN BRINGING CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
CAN'T GUARANTEE THE EVIDENCE
HASN'T BEEN COMPROMISED.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.600
THE MORTICIAN HADN'T TOUCHED HER YET. 

27:11.600 --> 27:12.800
EVEN SO,

27:12.800 --> 27:15.100
 SHE'S BEEN TRANSPORTED MORE TIMES
THAN I'D LIKE.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.900
DON'T WANT ANYONE TO GET THEIR HOPES UP.

27:16.900 --> 27:20.100
JUST MAKE SURE THE EVIDENCE GETS TO QUANTICO QUICKLY.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.800
EAST CLEVELAND HOMICIDES, FIRST QUARTER TO DATE--

27:23.800 --> 27:25.000
5 OUT OF 9 UNSOLVED.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.900
JANUARY 22--PROSTITUTE MURDER, DOWNTOWN AT 5th AND MAIN.

27:28.900 --> 27:31.500
JANUARY 9--MAN SHOT AT KINGSBURY PARK.

27:31.500 --> 27:35.600
FEBRUARY 15--KAYLA JAMES. LIVED ALONE.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.800
FIRST HOME INVASION...

27:36.800 --> 27:38.000
FEBRUARY 8--MURDER...

27:38.000 --> 27:39.400
YOUNG COUPLE SHOT IN PARK.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.700
NO APPARENT MOTIVE.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.700
INVESTIGATE.

27:41.700 --> 27:42.800
WHY ARE LOCATIONS DIFFERENT?

27:42.800 --> 27:44.800
PAGE 47, ROSSI'S BOOK: 

27:44.800 --> 27:46.800
THERE ARE NO COINCIDENCES.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.300
GARCIA, YOU GOT SOMETHING?

27:52.300 --> 27:55.300
YEAH, THE BOYS IN THE LAB FOUND TRACE AMOUNTS OF SALIVA
ON ZOE'S FOREHEAD,

27:55.300 --> 27:56.800
ENOUGH FOR A DNA SAMPLE.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.200
SO WE GOT A CODIS MATCH ON ERIC RYAN OLSON,

27:59.200 --> 28:00.900
23, CLEVELAND NATIVE,

28:00.900 --> 28:03.000
DID 2 1/2 YEARS FOR ATTEMPTED SEXUAL ASSAULT

28:03.000 --> 28:04.800
AND WAS PAROLED 6 MONTHS AGO.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.000
WE THOUGHT FOR SURE HE'D BE A STUDENT.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
UH, THAT'S 'CAUSE HE WAS. 

28:08.000 --> 28:09.100
WHILE HE WAS IN THE SLAMMER,

28:09.100 --> 28:11.500
HE TOOK INDEPENDENT CORRESPONDENCE CLASSES

28:11.500 --> 28:14.500
IN FORENSIC SCIENCE AND CRIMINOLOGY FROM AN OUT-OF-STATE SCHOOL.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.700
CALL THE TEAM. LET'S GET A SEARCH WARRANT.

28:16.700 --> 28:17.600
YEAH.

28:23.900 --> 28:24.800
CLEAR!

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
CLEAR!

28:26.700 --> 28:27.900
REID, CHECK THE COMPUTER.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.900
DETECTIVE, WE SHOULD TALK
O THE NEIGHBORS, FIND OUT WHERE HE GOES,

28:29.900 --> 28:31.300
WHERE HE MIGHT BE ON A WEEK NIGHT.

28:31.300 --> 28:32.000
AARON.

28:32.900 --> 28:34.900
HE'S READING MY BOOKS.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.300
REID, ANYTHING?

28:56.800 --> 28:59.000
AL'S ALEHOUSE. THAT'S LIKE 5 MILES AWAY.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.700
IT'S ON THE SCHEDULE FOR TONIGHT.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.700
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.SEE YOU TOMORROW.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.000
HE WAS ALONE AT THE BAR.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.300
WHEN DID HE LEAVE?

29:31.300 --> 29:32.400
LIKE 10 MINUTES AGO.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.000
DID HE TALK TO ANYONE?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.200
lINDA

29:36.600 --> 29:38.700
HE LEFT RIGHT AFTER SHE DID.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.800
THANKS.

29:54.300 --> 29:55.300
GOT IT, HOTCH. 

29:55.500 --> 29:58.300
MANAGER SAYS  HE MAY HAVE FOLLOWED ONE OF THE WAITRESSES
OUT OF THE BAR.

29:58.300 --> 30:00.100
SHE WALKS HOME THROUGH CEDAR PARK.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.900
WE JUST PASSED CEDAR PARK

30:17.400 --> 30:20.200
FBI! GET OFF THE GIRL! GET OFF THE GIRL!
-OK, IT'S OK. 

30:20.200 --> 30:21.800
STAY DOWN! STAY DOWN!

30:22.200 --> 30:24.900
GET OFF ME.
-IT'S ALL RIGHT. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

30:24.900 --> 30:27.300
STOP! WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU.

30:27.300 --> 30:30.100
??

30:38.100 --> 30:39.400
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.600
JJ: HOW COULD SHE NOT KNOW?

30:40.600 --> 30:42.800
KENNETH BIANCHI'S GIRLFRIEND HAD NO IDEA

30:42.800 --> 30:45.000
HE WAS ONE OF THE HILLSIDE STRANGLERS.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.300
JUST LIKE BTK's WIFE.

30:47.300 --> 30:48.700
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HER?

30:48.700 --> 30:50.200
HER NAME'S LINDA JONES.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.100
NO CRIMINAL RECORD.THEY MET ONLINE 6 WEEKS AGO. 

30:54.700 --> 30:57.100
NO, HE CAN'T BE THIS GUY.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.500
WE FOUND HIS DNA ON A MURDER VICTIM.

30:59.900 --> 31:00.900
WHAT?

31:00.900 --> 31:02.500
WE ALSO THINK HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER

31:02.500 --> 31:05.600
OF 7 OTHER PEOPLE OVER THE LAST 7 WEEKS.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.500
TWO OF HIS VICTIMS WERE RAPED.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.000
I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.400
OK, OK.

31:20.900 --> 31:22.100
AGAINST MY COUNSEL,

31:22.100 --> 31:24.600
MY CLIENT WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO AGENT ROSSI.

31:27.500 --> 31:30.000
WE TALKED ABOUT HIM BEING CURIOUS, ASKING QUESTIONS.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.300
IF HE THINKS HE KNOWS YOU, HE MIGHT OPEN UP.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.900
I'LL KEEP HIM TALKING.

31:33.900 --> 31:34.800
GOOD

31:40.700 --> 31:42.000
AGENT ROSSI.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.000
BIG FAN.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.400
WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE OF GREAT INTEREST TO YOU. 

31:50.600 --> 31:52.700
MY EARS ARE BURNING.

31:53.300 --> 31:56.600
MY LAWYER HERE EXPLAINS THAT I'M BEING CHARGED WITH 8 MURDERS

31:56.600 --> 31:59.100
AND THAT I'M PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE DEATH PENALTY.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.800
I HAVE ONE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR YOU.

32:02.500 --> 32:05.500
ARE YOU SURE IT'S JUST 8?

32:07.200 --> 32:08.100
WHAT?

32:08.600 --> 32:10.300
WE CHECKED MISSING PERSONS.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.400
SINCE HE STARTED KILLING,

32:11.400 --> 32:14.200
4 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REPORTED MISSING
IN EAST CLEVELAND NEIGHBORHOODS. 

32:14.200 --> 32:16.600
WE CAN'T RULE OUT ANY OF THEM AS HIS POSSIBLE VICTIMS.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.500
HE MARKED PAGES ON SEVERAL SERIAL KILLERS.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.200
WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES HE TRIED TO COPYCAT.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.500
WE'RE SCREWED, THEN.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.400
THE D.A. IS GONNA HAVE TO OFFER HIM A DEAL.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.000
THE D.A. DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE HIM THE OPTION.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.700
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

32:26.700 --> 32:33.700
YOU GET TO GO H

32:26.700 --> 32:28.100
YOU GET TO GO HOME TOMORROW.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.100
WHAT DO I TELL THE FAMILIES OF THE MISSING?

32:30.100 --> 32:31.500
SORRY, NO IDEA?

32:31.500 --> 32:32.800
DETECTIVE, WE'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE

32:32.800 --> 32:35.500
UNTIL WE CAN GIVE YOU AND THE FAMILIES SOME CLOSURE.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.900
AND HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?

32:38.500 --> 32:39.800
REID.-Hotc

32:39.800 --> 32:41.700
I NEED SOMETHING, NYTHING THAT MIGHT SHOW

32:41.700 --> 32:43.700
WHERE HE WAS TROLLING FOR MORE VICTIMS.

32:43.900 --> 32:45.100
ONCE THE D.A. GETS HERE,

32:45.100 --> 32:46.900
WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.200
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT OF THIS?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.200
I DON'T KNOW.

32:51.300 --> 32:52.400
WE'LL SEE.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.400
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE, ERIC.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.200
YOU GOT TO SPEAK TO HIM.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.400
NOW LET'S JUST WAIT FOR THE D.A.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.800
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BREAK IT TO YOU, KID,

32:59.800 --> 33:02.200
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A CARD TO PLAY HERE.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.700
WE'RE 3 STEPS AHEAD OF YOU.

33:06.900 --> 33:07.600
REALLY.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.100
WE'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY

33:10.100 --> 33:12.000
THAT YOU KILLED OTHER PEOPLE.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.100
WE KNEW YOU WERE YOUNG, WANTED TO EXPERIMENT.

33:15.100 --> 33:18.600
IT WAS LIKELY YOU WOULD COPYCAT
AS MANY SERIAL KILLERS AS POSSIBLE

33:18.600 --> 33:20.500
TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE

33:20.500 --> 33:22.300
 AND WHAT YOU LIKED.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.900
SO LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

33:27.100 --> 33:30.700
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME ALREADY

33:30.700 --> 33:33.000
WHERE THE OTHER BODIES ARE BURIED?

33:39.200 --> 33:40.500
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH EVERYTHING.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.400
HE MARKED UP ROSSI'S BOOKS. CHECK THE BOOKCASE.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.300
MAYBE HE WAS SCOUTING FOR LOCATIONS
TO COMMIT MORE MURDERS.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.600
PICTURES.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.600
WHAT?

33:50.600 --> 33:52.600
FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS IN HIS HALLWAY.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.000
NOTHING ELSE... NOTHING ELSE IS FRAMED.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.900
THEY LOOK LIKE ORIGINALS. LET ME CALL YOU RIGHT BACK, HOTCH.

33:56.900 --> 33:57.900
OK.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.700
I NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR SEX LIFE.

34:06.800 --> 34:07.800
THAT'S PERSONAL.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.900
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S A SERIAL KILLER.

34:10.199 --> 34:12.900
YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS NO LONGER PRIVATE.

34:15.300 --> 34:18.100
I-IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL TO EXPERIMENT WITH SEX.

34:18.699 --> 34:20.500
OK. IT MIGHT BE NORMAL TO HAVE SEX IN A PUBLIC PARK,

34:20.500 --> 34:22.100
BUT THE OTHER THINGS?

34:23.300 --> 34:25.400
WE WERE JUST ROLE-PLAYING.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.600
EVERY COUPLE HAS FANTASIES

34:27.600 --> 34:28.800
DID YOU EVER THINK IT WAS STRANGE 

34:28.800 --> 34:32.900
THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND HAS FANTASIES
ABOUT STRANGLING AND RAPING WOMEN? 

34:33.000 --> 34:34.900
NOT WOMEN.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.800
JUST ME.

34:42.199 --> 34:45.600
DID HE...KISS YOU ON THE FOREHEAD, TOO?

34:48.900 --> 34:50.400
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

34:50.800 --> 34:51.699
NOW,

34:52.800 --> 34:54.699
 WERE YOU SICK MUCH AS A KID?

34:56.600 --> 34:59.100
I GOT STREP THROAT EVERY FLU SEASON.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.500
DID YOU JUST PROFILE THAT ABOUT ME?

35:02.500 --> 35:04.200
HER NAME WAS ZOE HAWKES--

35:04.200 --> 35:06.800
THE GIRL YOU KILLED 3 DAYS AGO.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.300
WE FOUND YOUR DNA ON HER FOREHEAD.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.100
IT'LL NEVER BE ADMISSIBLE IN COURT.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.300
HER BODY WAS REMOVED FROM A STATE FACILITY AND--

35:13.300 --> 35:16.300
NOW, MOST PEOPLE WOULD ASK WHAT YOU DID.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.500
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.700
YOU KISSED HER ON THE FOREHEAD.

35:20.900 --> 35:23.900
WHAT I WHAT TO KNOW IS, WHY?

35:27.600 --> 35:30.800
WHY DO YOU THINK SOMEONE WOULD DO THAT, AGENT ROSSI?

35:30.900 --> 35:34.300
WELL, THAT'S WHY I ASKED IF YOU HAD BEEN ILL MUCH

35:34.400 --> 35:35.800
AS A CHILD.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.800
YOU SEE, YOU'RE SLIGHT, PALE, SICKLY.

35:39.300 --> 35:42.300
MOST PARENTS,
THEY KISS THEIR CHILDREN ON THE FOREHEAD

35:42.300 --> 35:44.300
TO SEE IF THEIR TEMPERATURE IS WARM.

35:44.500 --> 35:48.300
NOW, MY THEORY IS THAT YOU,
SOMEHOW IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT,

35:48.400 --> 35:52.900
WARPED THAT CARING GESTURE INTO SOMETHING PERVERSE.

35:55.200 --> 35:58.100
SO, DID YOU SIT NEXT TO ZOE

35:58.300 --> 36:00.600
TO SEE IF SHE GOT COLD?

36:01.700 --> 36:03.700
IS THAT WHY YOU KISSED HER?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.300
THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING THEORY.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.400
MAKE A GREAT CHAPTER IN ONE OF YOUR BOOKS.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.200
YEAH, REID.

36:15.200 --> 36:18.100
I FOUND PICTURES ON HIS COMPUTER IN A SPECIAL FOLDER HE CREATED.

36:18.100 --> 36:19.400
THEY'RE SCENIC PLACES IN THE CITY.

36:19.400 --> 36:22.400
3 OF THEM I RECOGNIZE FROM HIS CRIME SCENES.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.200
THERE ARE MORE PICTURES OF PLACES I DON'T RECOGNIZE.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.100
ALL RIGHT. EMAIL THEM AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

36:27.300 --> 36:29.400
THIS GUYS GETTING OFF ON THOSE PHOTOS.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.300
THEN WHAT DOES HE NEED LINDA FOR?

36:31.300 --> 36:34.200
DID HE HAVE ANY OTHER STRANGE PREFERENCES IN BED?

36:35.200 --> 36:36.100
NO.

36:36.100 --> 36:38.300
DID HE EVER ROLE PLAY BY TYING YOU UP?

36:38.500 --> 36:39.600
NO

36:39.800 --> 36:40.800
ARE YOU SURE?

36:40.800 --> 36:42.000
YES.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.900
I'M SURE.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.400
?

36:52.100 --> 36:54.700
IT WAS REALLY THE ONLY WAY HE COULD GET EXCITED.

36:54.700 --> 36:55.900
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

36:55.900 --> 36:58.800
WELL, HE DIDN'T... LIKE...

36:59.000 --> 37:00.800
HAVING SEX IN BED.

37:01.800 --> 37:05.600
SO HE JUST TOOK ME TO PUBLIC PLACES.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.000
WHERE?

37:09.400 --> 37:11.300
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS?

37:11.800 --> 37:12.800
PLEASE.

37:13.100 --> 37:13.900
OK.

37:17.100 --> 37:19.300
THE FIRST TIME WAS...

37:19.800 --> 37:21.700
AT KINGSBURY PARK.

37:22.700 --> 37:23.800
AND THEN...

37:24.900 --> 37:26.500
AT A MOVIE THEATER.

37:26.700 --> 37:28.700
IN THE PARKING LOT, IN MY CAR.

37:30.300 --> 37:32.900
DID HE EVER TAKE YOU TO THE SECOND STREET BRIDGE,

37:32.900 --> 37:34.500
OFF THE BIKE PATH?

37:35.900 --> 37:37.000
yeag

37:38.300 --> 37:40.300
THAT'S WHERE THE JOGGER WAS KILLED.

37:40.400 --> 37:43.300
HE CAN ONLY HAVE SEX WITH LINDA WHEN HE'S
REVISITING HIS CRIMES.

37:43.300 --> 37:44.700
IF THAT'S THE CASE,WHAT WERE THE DOING IN THE PARK

37:44.700 --> 37:46.000
WHERE WE PICKED THEM UP?

37:52.000 --> 37:53.200
I NEED YOU TO WRITE DOWN FOR ME

37:53.200 --> 37:55.500
ALL THE PLACES HE TOOK YOU TO HAVE SEX.

38:05.900 --> 38:08.800
THE D.A.'S NOT GONNA NEED TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL WITH YOU.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.600
CEDAR PARK, EDGEWATER CHANNEL,

38:19.600 --> 38:22.900
CUYAHOGA VALLEY PARK, EUCLID CREEK.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.700
WE'LL SEND UNITS IN THE MORNING TO SEARCH FOR THE BODIES.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.200
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

38:33.200 --> 38:34.500
ERIC.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.100
IS IT SOMETHING THAT I DID?

38:36.100 --> 38:39.300
YOU NEEDED TO REVISIT THE CRIME SCENES

38:39.300 --> 38:43.600
BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO GET A GRATIFYING
SEXUAL RELEASE.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.300
BUT REVISITING THE SCENES WASN'T ENOUGH.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.900
YOU HAD TO CAPTURE IT ON FILM, 

38:49.900 --> 38:51.500
PUT IT ON YOUR COMPUTER,

38:51.500 --> 38:53.900
DISPLAY IT ON YOUR WALL,

38:54.400 --> 38:57.200
SO YOU COULD LOOK AT IT EVERY DAY.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.500
ERIC, WE SHOULD TALK PRIVATELY.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.400
THIS ISN'T OVER.

39:07.500 --> 39:10.000
I ALWAYS KNEW I'D END UP BACK IN PRISON.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.100
JUST A MATTER OF WHEN.

39:13.300 --> 39:15.400
YOU CAN COME INTERVIEW ME IF YOU WANT.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.400
I READ IN ONE OF YOUR BOOKS

39:17.400 --> 39:20.500
THAT'S HOW YOU BUILT YOUR BEHAVIORAL DATABASE, RIGHT?

39:20.700 --> 39:23.000
MAYBE YOU CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM ME.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.900
I GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS MYSELF.

39:30.700 --> 39:33.500
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU IF YOU'RE HONEST WITH ME.

39:35.900 --> 39:37.800
'CAUSE THE ONE THING THAT YOU ALWAYS ASK

39:37.800 --> 39:40.000
IS THE ONE THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.500
WHY

39:44.900 --> 39:46.700
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.800
I SEE A GUY WALKING DOWN THE STREET

39:50.800 --> 39:52.300
WITH A STUPID LOOK ON HIS FACE

39:52.300 --> 39:55.000
AND I WANT TO BASH HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH A BOTTLE.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.900
TO ME THAT'S NORMAL.

40:00.900 --> 40:04.100
IT'S WEIRD TO ME THAT NO ONE ELSE FEELS THAT WAY.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.600
IT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT.

40:09.300 --> 40:10.800
I CAN'T STOP.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.100
THIS IS NOT UP FOR DEBATE.

40:42.100 --> 40:44.400
CANCEL THE REST OF THE DATES.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.400
IS EVERYTHING OK?

40:47.400 --> 40:50.100
WHY DO PEOPLE 
WANT TO HEAR ME TALK ABOUT SERIAL KILLERS?

40:50.100 --> 40:52.000
IS IT THAT ENTERTAINING?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
THERE'S A PUBLIC FASCINATION WITH THEM.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.700
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF MY BOOKS ARE DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

40:57.700 --> 40:59.800
MY SENIOR YEAR AT GEORGETOWN...

40:59.800 --> 41:01.000
I WAS GRADUATING, 

41:01.000 --> 41:02.100
I DID NOT HAVE A CLUE

41:02.100 --> 41:04.000
WHAT I WAS GONNA DO WITH MY LIFE.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.300
AND ONE DAY I WAS IN THE CAMPUS BOOKSTORE

41:06.300 --> 41:08.400
AND YOU WERE THERE,

41:08.500 --> 41:10.700
PROMOTING YOUR SECOND BOOK

41:10.900 --> 41:12.800
SAT THROUGH YOUR WHOLE TALK

41:13.600 --> 41:15.200
YOU NEVER TOLD ME.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.900
I ASKED YOU WHAT IT WAS YOU WERE MOST PROUD OF,

41:17.900 --> 41:21.900
AND YOU SHOWED US A PICTURE OF A BOY FROM CHARLESTON.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.600
BRENT ROBERTS.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.100
A NEIGHBOR TOOK HIM.

41:25.100 --> 41:26.600
HE WAS FOUND ALIVE.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.200
ONE OF THE FEW.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.600
THAT NIGHT, I BOUGHT YOUR BOOk

41:32.100 --> 41:34.600
APPLIED TO THE ACADEMYTHE NEXT FALL. 

41:39.400 --> 41:41.300
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE AIRPORT.

41:50.100 --> 41:53.700
 AUSTRIAN NOVELIST MARIE VON EBNER-ESCHENBACH WROTE:

41:53.900 --> 41:55.700
"IN YOUTH WE LEARN.

41:55.700 --> 41:58.800
IN AGE WE UNDERSTAND."

42:08.100 --> 42:09.600
I HEAR YOU CAUGHT HIM.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.600
WE DID.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.900
IS HE GOING TO PRISON?

42:18.200 --> 42:20.200
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.000
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.700
HE'S ALIVE, ZOE'S NOT.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.800
BUT SHE'D BE PLEASED THAT YOU CAUGHT HIM.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.600
I HOPE SO.
