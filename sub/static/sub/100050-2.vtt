00:01.840 --> 00:03.200
Abigail Baker?
Here.

00:03.200 --> 00:04.480
Georgie Cooper?

00:04.480 --> 00:05.960
Here.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.520
Sheldon Cooper?

00:09.440 --> 00:11.200
Georgie, where's your brother?

00:11.200 --> 00:12.640
I don't know.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.160
Good enough for me.
Melissa Dixon?

00:23.640 --> 00:26.240
ADULT SHELDON:
Since I no longer
had a college class

00:26.240 --> 00:29.160
with Dr. Sturgis
to stoke my intellectual fire,

00:29.160 --> 00:32.640
I needed to find someone else
who was up to the task

00:32.640 --> 00:34.720
of being my mentor.

00:34.720 --> 00:35.960
A great mind.

00:35.960 --> 00:39.000
A once-in-a-generation thinker.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Fortunately,
my schedule was wide open.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.520
(exhales)

00:51.320 --> 00:54.120
School's in session.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.040
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

00:57.040 --> 00:59.880
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

00:59.880 --> 01:02.520
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:02.520 --> 01:04.840
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:04.840 --> 01:09.080
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

01:14.000 --> 01:16.400
Pastor Jeff,
I just need your signature...

01:16.400 --> 01:17.920
Oh. Uh, sorry.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.200
I didn't realize
you had a guest.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.120
It's quite all right.
You remember Robin?

01:21.120 --> 01:22.800
Of course.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.600
So nice to see
you again.
You, too.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.280
Well, I don't want
to interrupt.
Actually,

01:26.280 --> 01:28.360
I was just fixin'
to head out.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.880
Already?
Yeah.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.400
Discharged my firearm
at a muskrat yesterday.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.040
Lot of paperwork.
(chuckles)

01:35.200 --> 01:36.240
See you soon?

01:36.240 --> 01:38.160
Yes, you will.
(chuckles)

01:38.160 --> 01:39.840
Bye, Mrs. Cooper.
Bye.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.560
That seems to be going well.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.120
It's going really well.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.120
I like her so much.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.880
Why do you sound sad about it?

01:50.040 --> 01:53.080
Well, this is hard
for me to say out loud.

01:56.440 --> 02:00.400
But when I'm around her,
I find myself having...

02:00.400 --> 02:02.160
you know.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.920
I don't know.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.960
(whispers):
Man thoughts.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.320
Oh. But...
you're the pastor.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.160
You can't act on those.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.200
Hence my sadness.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.240
What are you gonna do?

02:14.240 --> 02:15.760
I'm not sure.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.320
I can't engage in a
physical relationship

02:17.320 --> 02:19.480
outside of holy matrimony.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.600
Right?

02:21.600 --> 02:24.160
Right.
Right.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.400
A solution is
a homogenous mixture

02:31.400 --> 02:33.560
consisting of a solute
and a solvent.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.440
The solute is the substance

02:35.440 --> 02:37.400
that is being dissolved...

02:41.080 --> 02:43.240
A squared plus B squared

02:43.240 --> 02:44.560
equals...?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.520
(bell rings)

02:52.720 --> 02:53.960
Aw.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.040
And Pastor Jeff asked me

02:57.040 --> 03:00.560
to hold him accountable so he
doesn't succumb to temptation.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.120
Well, how the heck
you do that?

03:02.120 --> 03:03.800
I'm not sure.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.840
Probably have to give him
the stink eye every so often.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.200
The pastor's been
married before.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.960
Is it really
that big a deal?

03:10.960 --> 03:13.240
Yes, George. It states
very clearly in the Bible:

03:13.240 --> 03:17.080
"Among you there must not be
even a hint of...

03:17.080 --> 03:18.400
(hushed):
sexual...

03:18.400 --> 03:20.240
immorality.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.920
That book is a
bummer sometimes.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.160
It's no joke.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.240
He could lose his job.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.960
I guess I just
don't get it.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.720
Maybe because you only go to
church when there's a bake sale.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.120
That's not nice.
It's true.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.000
Doesn't make it nice.

03:44.540 --> 03:47.300
Everything all right
with Sheldon?

03:47.300 --> 03:49.060
How much time you got?

03:49.060 --> 03:51.820
Why?
Hasn't been in P.E.
since Monday.

03:51.820 --> 03:53.220
Really?
Mm-hmm.

03:53.220 --> 03:54.700
He's here. I drove him.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.220
You check the places
they like to stuff him?

03:57.220 --> 03:58.980
Lockers, trash cans,

03:58.980 --> 04:00.900
those bags
we put the footballs in.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.140
Nothing.

04:02.140 --> 04:04.660
Top of the flagpole?
Nope.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.660
Hey, Hubert.

04:08.660 --> 04:10.460
Was Sheldon in class today?

04:10.460 --> 04:12.100
Nope. Haven't seen
him all week.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.100
Weren't you gonna say anything?

04:14.100 --> 04:16.060
I didn't want to jinx it.

04:18.860 --> 04:21.060
So he hasn't been
in any of your classes?

04:21.060 --> 04:22.700
Mm-mm, not a one.
Nope.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.460
But I bring him here,
I take him home--

04:24.460 --> 04:25.660
he's got to be somewhere
in the building.

04:25.660 --> 04:27.740
Mm, I might've seen
him in the library.

04:27.740 --> 04:29.260
But at this point,
I sometimes think

04:29.260 --> 04:31.380
I see him when I'm
alone in my house.

04:31.380 --> 04:33.620
Like that creepy Chucky doll
in the movies?

04:33.620 --> 04:35.700
(laughs):
Exactly!

04:35.700 --> 04:37.260
(both laughing)

04:40.380 --> 04:42.820
Hey, Tam.
I can't find Sheldon.

04:42.820 --> 04:44.380
You know where he is?

04:44.380 --> 04:46.500
I promised not to say.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.740
Tam...

04:47.740 --> 04:49.500
Lucky for you I'm weak.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.060
Are you kidding me?

04:52.060 --> 04:53.940
I knew Tam was weak.

04:53.940 --> 04:55.460
What do you think
you're doing?

04:55.460 --> 04:57.420
Exploring the impact
of the French invasion

04:57.420 --> 04:59.580
on Imperial Russian society.

04:59.580 --> 05:01.140
Well, get out of here.

05:01.140 --> 05:02.620
You're going back to class.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.860
No, I'm not.

05:03.860 --> 05:05.380
Excuse me?

05:05.380 --> 05:06.820
I don't learn
anything in class.

05:06.820 --> 05:09.060
But in here I've taught
myself the applications

05:09.060 --> 05:10.820
of gravitational lensing,

05:10.820 --> 05:12.620
Faraday's law of
magnetic induction,

05:12.620 --> 05:13.860
and how to whistle.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.100
(blows air)

05:15.100 --> 05:17.220
Well, sound came
out yesterday.

05:17.220 --> 05:19.660
Y-You can't spend your day
in a broom closet.

05:19.660 --> 05:21.340
It's no longer
a broom closet.

05:21.340 --> 05:24.420
It's now a citadel
of higher learning.

05:31.620 --> 05:34.660
Which one says
"Robin, I like you"

05:34.660 --> 05:36.460
but also says
"God is watching,

05:36.460 --> 05:38.060
(whispers):
be cool"?

05:38.060 --> 05:40.020
The blue one.
(intercom beeps)

05:40.020 --> 05:42.140
PEG: Mary,
your husband's on the line.

05:42.140 --> 05:43.940
Excuse me.
Yeah, blue.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.900
Definitely blue.

05:46.660 --> 05:47.900
Although...

05:47.900 --> 05:49.260
Everything okay?

05:49.260 --> 05:50.700
Sheldon locked himself
in a broom closet,

05:50.700 --> 05:52.660
and he's refusing
to go to class.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.460
What's he doing in a closet?

05:54.460 --> 05:55.860
Apparently,
learning about Russia.

05:55.860 --> 05:57.100
(sighs):
Well,

05:57.100 --> 05:58.340
what do you want me to do?

05:58.340 --> 05:59.580
I want you to handle it.

05:59.580 --> 06:01.540
You're right there--
why can't you handle it?

06:01.540 --> 06:03.740
'Cause I'm at work.
So am I.

06:03.740 --> 06:05.300
You know what I mean.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.220
That you have a real job
and I don't?

06:07.220 --> 06:10.060
Mary, I have football practice
in ten minutes, and I...

06:10.060 --> 06:11.700
I don't have time
to deal with this.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.620
Well, you're gonna have to,
'cause I'm busy.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.540
You tell him, sister.

06:18.580 --> 06:21.260
The bolo tie's too sexy, right?

06:22.740 --> 06:24.340
Knew it.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.660
Hope you're happy-- your mother
and I are fighting now!

06:30.700 --> 06:34.620
There's a closet, it...
My son made a citadel.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.220
Never mind.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.760
Sheldon, go to your room.
Gladly.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.280
He's just gonna read in there.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.720
I'd take away Professor Proton.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.640
Stay out of this.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.740
No more Professor Proton!

06:48.740 --> 06:49.780
SHELDON:
Aw.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.380
That's how you do it.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.540
I can't believe you
didn't make him go to class.

06:53.540 --> 06:55.500
You told me to handle it;
I handled it.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.580
That one's on you.

06:56.580 --> 06:59.540
You didn't handle it.
You didn't do anything.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.660
I had to get to practice,
and I made a decision.

07:01.660 --> 07:04.900
He was in the building, he was
safe, and he was learning.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.020
He is never gonna improve
his social skills

07:07.020 --> 07:08.380
if he's sitting all alone.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.220
He has to be around people.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.220
Sounds like you know what
he needs-- go fix it.

07:12.220 --> 07:14.380
'Cause I have to do
everything, right?

07:14.380 --> 07:17.620
Oh. Someone's sleeping
on the couch tonight.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.180
Get out of here!

07:19.180 --> 07:20.660
MEEMAW: Well,
maybe Shel is

07:20.660 --> 07:21.660
just acting out

07:21.660 --> 07:23.140
'cause he doesn't have
his college class

07:23.140 --> 07:24.380
to go to anymore.

07:24.380 --> 07:26.060
I could ask
John's professor friend.

07:26.060 --> 07:28.540
Maybe he'd let him sit in
on a class.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.660
And you are
just bringing this up now?

07:30.660 --> 07:32.140
I would've said
something earlier,

07:32.140 --> 07:34.140
but I was enjoying the fight.
(chuckles)

07:36.460 --> 07:38.460
(phone ringing)

07:39.660 --> 07:40.740
Hello?

07:40.740 --> 07:42.220
Hi, Dr. Linkletter.

07:42.220 --> 07:43.780
It's Connie Tucker.
Connie.

07:43.780 --> 07:45.900
To what do I owe the pleasure?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.820
I need a favor.
Of course. Anything.

07:47.820 --> 07:49.700
Should we discuss it
over dinner?

07:49.700 --> 07:51.100
I'll take a rain check on that.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.060
I was hoping

07:53.060 --> 07:56.140
that my grandson
could join in your physics class

07:56.140 --> 07:58.700
until John is, uh...

07:58.700 --> 07:59.740
back.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.460
From the mental hospital?

08:01.460 --> 08:02.660
Yes.

08:02.660 --> 08:05.620
The one he never told you
he'd been in before?

08:05.620 --> 08:07.260
Yes.

08:07.260 --> 08:09.620
A curious ethical choice
on his part, if you ask me.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.460
Can he take the class or not?

08:11.460 --> 08:12.660
Of course.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.740
Although,
I never taught a child before.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.980
Is he potty-trained?

08:19.420 --> 08:20.900
(chuckling)

08:22.860 --> 08:24.700
What are you doing?

08:24.700 --> 08:27.660
Watching last week's
Professor Proton in my mind.

08:27.660 --> 08:28.900
MEEMAW (calls):
Moon Pie?

08:28.900 --> 08:30.180
(gasps)

08:30.180 --> 08:32.580
Good news.
You could start going

08:32.580 --> 08:34.740
to your college class again.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.100
Dr. Sturgis is back?

08:36.100 --> 08:38.620
No, but his friend
Dr. Linkletter

08:38.620 --> 08:41.260
is gonna let you
come and take his class.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.580
But I take Dr. Sturgis's class.

08:42.580 --> 08:44.260
I know, but that's
not an option

08:44.260 --> 08:47.260
right now, and Dr. Linkletter's
been nice enough to...

08:47.260 --> 08:49.380
to let you sit in on his.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.780
But I like the way
that Dr. Sturgis teaches.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.220
Well, you might like the way

08:53.220 --> 08:55.860
that Dr. Linkletter teaches
even better.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.620
Is it lecture-based?
I don't know.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.460
What's his interpretation
of quantum mechanics?

08:59.460 --> 09:01.660
I couldn't say.
Where'd he get his doctorate?

09:01.660 --> 09:04.660
From the University
of Shut Up and Say Thank You.

09:04.660 --> 09:06.460
Thank you.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.160
I thought you were gonna
take out the garbage.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.320
I'm sorry.
I was under the impression

09:16.320 --> 09:18.200
you did everything around here.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.480
You really want to
start this again?

09:20.480 --> 09:22.840
I contribute plenty,

09:22.840 --> 09:25.040
and it wouldn't kill you
to show a little appreciation.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.720
I'll be sure to do that--
as soon as I finish

09:28.720 --> 09:31.200
the laundry, the dishes,
the vacuuming,

09:31.200 --> 09:34.200
the grocery shopping and helping
Missy with her homework.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.360
You like how my job pays
for all the bills, right?

09:36.360 --> 09:39.040
(phone rings)
Stop acting like you're
the only one with a job.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.520
GEORGE JR.:
Mom! Pastor Jeff's on the phone.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.160
I have to take this.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.680
'Course you do.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.640
Hi, Pastor Jeff.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.920
Everything okay?
(door opens)

09:49.920 --> 09:51.400
JEFF:
I'm in trouble.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.760
Robin just got here.

09:52.760 --> 09:56.040
She looks nice,
and she smells even nicer.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.160
Come on, now.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.880
Uh, nothing smells better
than eternal salvation.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.880
I know.
But we put so much thought

10:01.880 --> 10:03.240
into my clothes,
we didn't even think

10:03.240 --> 10:04.600
about what she'd be wearing.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.160
GEORGE JR.:
Why?

10:06.160 --> 10:07.200
What's she wearing?

10:07.200 --> 10:10.520
Georgie, you hang up
that phone right now!

10:13.920 --> 10:17.000
I mean, I-I just can't
win. When I step in,

10:17.100 --> 10:19.620
I'm doing it wrong, and when I
don't step in, she yells at me.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.980
I hear you.

10:20.980 --> 10:23.100
So Darlene does the
same thing with you?

10:23.100 --> 10:24.900
No. But I'd hate it
if she did.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.140
That sounds awful.

10:26.140 --> 10:29.100
So, what do you
two fight about?

10:29.100 --> 10:30.900
You know, normal stuff.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.140
Who loves the other one more.

10:33.140 --> 10:35.380
Whose turn it is
for a foot rub.

10:35.380 --> 10:37.540
Oh, the other day,
we did argue

10:37.540 --> 10:39.620
about which way
the toilet paper should hang.

10:39.620 --> 10:40.940
Who won?

10:40.940 --> 10:42.420
I don't remember.

10:42.420 --> 10:44.660
We just ended up making love
on the bathroom floor.

10:45.220 --> 10:46.460
Thank you, Wayne.

10:46.460 --> 10:47.980
This has been real helpful.

10:48.780 --> 10:50.380
When was the last time

10:50.380 --> 10:53.220
you took Mary out on a date?

10:53.220 --> 10:55.580
I couldn't even tell you.

10:55.580 --> 10:58.140
Mm. That poor woman.
Hey.

10:58.140 --> 10:59.820
You're supposed
to be on my side.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.380
I'd like to be.

11:01.380 --> 11:04.580
(chuckles): But you're not
giving me much to work with.

11:14.580 --> 11:17.300
Hey.

11:23.740 --> 11:26.060
(exhales)

11:26.060 --> 11:28.540
Smells like you
had a good time.

11:28.540 --> 11:30.540
(sighs)

11:31.700 --> 11:33.900
How'd you like to go out
for dinner on Friday?

11:33.900 --> 11:35.500
Just you and me.

11:36.540 --> 11:37.620
Why?

11:37.620 --> 11:39.700
'Cause you're my wife.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.300
I was your wife last Friday,
and we didn't go to dinner.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.620
Mary, I'm asking you
on a date.

11:45.740 --> 11:47.740
Okay.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.740
(chuckles)
Is that a yes?

11:49.740 --> 11:52.340
Sure.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.060
All right, then.

11:56.420 --> 11:58.580
If you did something stupid,
I'm gonna find out.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.900
Same room. Different teacher.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.540
Same night.

12:07.540 --> 12:09.380
Different time.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.700
This is a real roller coaster.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.060
Yeah, it's wild.
LINKLETTER:
Connie.

12:13.060 --> 12:14.380
So nice to see you.

12:14.380 --> 12:15.940
Nice to see you, too. Sheldon,

12:15.940 --> 12:18.900
this is Dr. Linkletter.
Hello.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.540
I've heard so much about you.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.300
Apparently not how I feel
about shaking hands.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.980
And on that fun note,
I'll leave you to it.

12:25.980 --> 12:27.940
Are you sure you wouldn't
like to stay for the lecture?

12:27.940 --> 12:29.180
Oh, no, bad idea.

12:29.180 --> 12:30.660
I'm told I snore.

12:30.660 --> 12:31.980
Darling,
I'll be out in the hall

12:31.980 --> 12:33.780
if you need me.

12:33.780 --> 12:36.700
Mm. Just a warning:

12:36.700 --> 12:39.220
today's lecture is
rather advanced.

12:39.220 --> 12:40.620
Don't worry.
If you get confused,

12:40.620 --> 12:42.460
I'll be right here
in the front row.

12:45.620 --> 12:47.660
(smacks lips)

12:47.660 --> 12:49.660
So, this is nice, huh?

12:49.660 --> 12:51.900
Yes.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.900
(sighs)

13:01.740 --> 13:03.940
Lemon in the water.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.780
It's weird to look at a
menu and not have to wonder

13:08.780 --> 13:10.660
what Sheldon won't eat.
(chuckles)

13:10.660 --> 13:15.220
I-It got easier when he printed
that card for my wallet.

13:15.220 --> 13:18.380
Still don't know where
he got that laminated.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.900
Yeah.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.220
It's just the two of us.

13:21.220 --> 13:22.900
We don't have to talk
about the kids.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.220
You're right.

13:26.980 --> 13:30.300
(breathes deeply)

13:31.380 --> 13:33.260
You don't think
Georgie and Missy

13:33.260 --> 13:35.300
are doing anything
stupid, do you?

13:36.220 --> 13:38.540
If Mom knew
this was in the house,

13:38.540 --> 13:40.380
she'd lose her mind.
I know.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.260
Mom does not like demons.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.220
So, how does it work?

13:44.220 --> 13:45.620
You put your fingertips
on it like this,

13:45.620 --> 13:46.860
and you ask it questions.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.060
Then the spirits from beyond

13:49.060 --> 13:51.740
will move you around the
board and answer them.

13:51.740 --> 13:53.140
Whoa.

13:53.140 --> 13:54.620
Let's try it.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.620
Okay.

14:03.580 --> 14:06.180
Pastor Jeff talked about these
in Sunday school.

14:06.180 --> 14:09.740
(whispers): He called them
Satan's Monopoly board.

14:09.740 --> 14:11.660
Come on.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.300
(exhales)

14:15.740 --> 14:18.180
(phone ringing)
I'll get it.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.340
Hello?

14:23.140 --> 14:25.140
It's Pastor Jeff. What do I do?

14:25.140 --> 14:26.980
See what he wants.

14:27.740 --> 14:29.580
What do you want?

14:29.580 --> 14:31.740
Um, is your mom home?

14:31.740 --> 14:32.820
No, she went out with my dad.

14:32.820 --> 14:34.700
It's just me and Georgie.
JEFF: Oh.

14:34.700 --> 14:35.700
Okay.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.660
Well, I hope you two
are behaving yourselves.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.740
We are. We're just watching TV.

14:41.740 --> 14:43.740
Okay, bye.

14:43.740 --> 14:44.980
(dial tone sounds)

14:44.980 --> 14:46.420
I just lied to a pastor.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.740
So?
So I'm going to hell!

14:48.740 --> 14:50.780
No, you're not.
Yes, I am!

14:50.780 --> 14:52.980
Sucks for you.

14:53.820 --> 14:55.100
So then we're able to take

14:55.100 --> 14:56.580
the ends of the strings

14:56.580 --> 14:58.100
and connect them
to a ten-dimensional membrane.

14:58.740 --> 14:59.980
Yes, Sheldon.

14:59.980 --> 15:01.340
Dr. Sturgis taught us

15:01.340 --> 15:02.660
that if you leave
the strings open,

15:02.660 --> 15:04.540
it allows far more
possibilities.

15:04.540 --> 15:06.220
We don't believe
you need open strings anymore.

15:06.220 --> 15:09.300
That's an older model
of thinking. Now...

15:09.820 --> 15:11.420
Yes, Sheldon.

15:11.420 --> 15:12.620
Just because something is older

15:12.620 --> 15:14.700
doesn't mean
that it's not still good.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.620
Original Star Trek is older
than Next Generation,

15:16.620 --> 15:19.340
but if you think that Mr. Data
is better than Mr. Spock,

15:19.340 --> 15:21.300
you don't know
what you're talking about.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.940
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.700
Sorry you're not having
a good time.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.540
No, I am.

15:34.540 --> 15:36.900
This is lovely.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.620
But can I ask
what prompted it?

15:41.660 --> 15:43.620
Well...

15:43.620 --> 15:45.620
Wayne and I
were discussing marriage,

15:45.620 --> 15:48.220
and he was going on
about how happy he is.

15:48.220 --> 15:51.620
I just wanted to try
to work on ours.

15:52.660 --> 15:56.020
That's really sweet, George.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.940
So they go on dinner
dates like this?

15:58.940 --> 16:00.420
Oh, they do
all kinds of stuff.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.660
Line dancing and movie night.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.740
You wouldn't believe what they
got up to in their bathroom.

16:05.740 --> 16:07.020
Where do they find the time?

16:07.020 --> 16:08.420
(laughs):
Well...

16:08.420 --> 16:10.580
Well, they don't have
any kids, so...

16:11.820 --> 16:14.260
Son of a bitch.
They don't have kids.

16:14.260 --> 16:15.660
That's why they're happy.

16:15.660 --> 16:17.260
George.
It's true.

16:17.260 --> 16:19.700
You and I used to be
way more fun.

16:19.700 --> 16:22.060
That may be so, but you
can't blame the children.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.140
(chuckles):
Oh, I can, and I am.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.860
Don't get me wrong.
They're great. I love them.

16:25.860 --> 16:29.620
But you got to admit that they
do not make our lives easy.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.180
(scoffs)

16:31.180 --> 16:33.420
I suppose there's a...

16:33.420 --> 16:35.580
challenging aspect to them.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.740
There you go. See?

16:37.740 --> 16:40.620
Feels good to say it
out loud, right?

16:40.620 --> 16:42.380
Maybe a little.

16:42.380 --> 16:44.100
(chuckles)
Hey.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.900
Think about how clean
the house would be

16:45.900 --> 16:47.460
if it was just us.

16:47.460 --> 16:48.660
Oh, my.

16:48.660 --> 16:50.140
(both chuckling)

16:52.940 --> 16:55.580
So, what did they do
in the bathroom?

16:57.900 --> 16:59.220
I'm going to hell.
I'm going to hell.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.260
Relax. Not until you're dead.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.960
You smell really nice.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.200
(chuckles)

17:06.200 --> 17:08.080
Thank you.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.920
It's soap.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.240
I love soap.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.160
(phone ringing)

17:17.160 --> 17:18.640
I'll get it.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.960
Hello?

17:20.960 --> 17:22.360
MISSY:
I lied to you.

17:22.360 --> 17:23.680
I wasn't watching TV.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.440
I was playing
with a Ouija board.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.160
Uh, who is this?
Missy Cooper,

17:27.160 --> 17:28.640
and I'm going to hell.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.840
Uh, Missy, you're-you're
not gonna go to hell.

17:30.840 --> 17:31.880
Yes, I am.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.200
God knows what I did.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.600
He sees everything.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.440
You're right.

17:38.440 --> 17:42.280
God does see everything.

17:42.280 --> 17:44.920
But He also just saw you
be a good Christian

17:44.920 --> 17:46.040
and tell the truth.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.360
So I promise, your soul is safe.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.360
You're sure?
I'm sure.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.280
If you're lying,
you're going to hell, too.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.520
I'm sure.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.880
(sighs)
Thank you.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.680
You take care, now.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.200
The Lord just
sent me a message.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.920
Really?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.520
I'm sorry.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.520
I can't be in a
physical relationship

18:11.520 --> 18:13.480
outside of marriage.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.840
Okay.
(chuckles softly)

18:15.840 --> 18:17.880
I respect that.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.360
Thank you.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.520
So when are we
getting married?

18:22.280 --> 18:24.440
Uh...

18:25.200 --> 18:27.280
We don't need open strings.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.040
We just connect them
to a D-brane.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.520
But your theories can't
recreate the known symmetries

18:31.520 --> 18:33.040
of the real world.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.320
Everything okay in here?

18:34.320 --> 18:36.400
More than okay. We're
having a spirited debate

18:36.400 --> 18:38.040
on superstring theory.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.080
Very spirited.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.720
Well, you ready to go home?

18:40.720 --> 18:42.760
Yes. Unless Dr. Linkletter...

18:42.760 --> 18:44.280
He's ready.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.280
Well, I guess
we'll see you next week.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.520
Sounds good.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.680
No wonder Sturgis went crazy.
