WEBVTT

00:09.426 --> 00:11.010
Hey, Art, let's go.

00:13.805 --> 00:14.805
You ready for this?

00:15.098 --> 00:16.807
You believe in doppelgangers, Angela?

00:16.891 --> 00:19.560
Doppelgangers running around
to confuse the issue?

00:19.602 --> 00:20.936
No.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.062
How about twins?

00:22.105 --> 00:24.356
Beth ever mention a twin sister?

00:24.441 --> 00:26.483
What the hell is going on?

00:28.153 --> 00:31.363
Look, we identified Sarah Manning
as Jane Doe, so...

00:31.865 --> 00:33.407
We gotta make a house call.

00:36.619 --> 00:37.786
Hey...

00:38.288 --> 00:40.289
You mind keeping this between us?

00:40.373 --> 00:42.583
Just till we figure out what the hell it is.

00:42.667 --> 00:46.754
- Yeah, sure. Yeah, sounds good to me.
- Thanks.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.563
We can't go back to the town house.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.149
Mmm-mmm.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.992
Olivier's boss, Dr. Leekie, is flying in today.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.410
--He'll be looking for you.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.828
Okay.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.166
For a second there,
I forgot I was a clone.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.503
He thinks you are the one killing his clones.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.176
Oh. Sorry.

01:34.594 --> 01:37.262
Couldn't afford lattes for Bonnie and Clyde.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.181
Morning, Fe.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.391
Can we torch this, please?

01:41.684 --> 01:43.143
- What?
- Your psycho sister's coat

01:43.186 --> 01:44.478
smells like low tide.

01:44.854 --> 01:48.357
Felix, Sarah's gonna
have to hole up here for a while.

01:48.483 --> 01:51.193
You, too? impinging on my creativity.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.570
- Shagging in my bed.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.369
- Alison.
- Oh, brilliant.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.871
Invite her, too.
Then maybe we can all cuddle up

02:02.956 --> 02:04.998
with Weight Watchers and Grey's Anatomy.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.377
- Hey. How was couple's camp?
- I came back early.

02:08.794 --> 02:12.172
Cosima filled me in already,
and I'm taking a break from you two.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.133
I need to get my house together.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.094
Uh, isn't that what
marriage counseling was for?

02:17.720 --> 02:19.847
- Donnie and I are getting a divorce.
- What?

02:19.889 --> 02:22.683
Oh, I'm fine. it's my decision.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.561
- Everything is under control.
- Okay, now I'm worried.

02:25.603 --> 02:26.687
Well, don't be.

02:26.896 --> 02:30.065
I can take care of myself
and I don't need you...

02:30.942 --> 02:33.569
...helping me clear my deck
of liars and spies.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.071
Alison, you don't know
who your monitor is, okay?

02:36.114 --> 02:37.447
Don't fixate.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.826
I'm reclaiming my life, Sarah.
Please respect that.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.630
Aynesley, what are you doing?

02:53.715 --> 02:55.215
Alison, you're home.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.176
I told you I was coming back early.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.512
But not today, silly.
I just came to water the plants.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.805
Did you?

03:04.100 --> 03:05.601
I'll get it.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.771
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.274
What have I said about
answering the door on your own?

03:12.317 --> 03:13.901
Only when we invite someone.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.486
Uh-huh. And we have not. Have we?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.033
Kira, go up to your room.

03:21.534 --> 03:22.743
Quick.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.627
- Siobhan Sadler?
- Who wants to know?

03:31.711 --> 03:33.962
Detectives Bell and Deangelis.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.257
Are you the legal guardian of Sarah Manning?

04:15.463 --> 04:16.964
Sarah's dead?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.632
I'm sorry.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.510
How?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.303
Uh, she was shot.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.013
Shot.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.807
When?

04:27.892 --> 04:29.643
On or around November 25th.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.396
November 25th, that's two weeks ago.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.231
Identification took some time.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.942
Which you're sure it's her?

04:41.447 --> 04:44.199
Did you know if Sarah
had problems with anyone?

04:44.659 --> 04:47.119
Women, especially, but not exclusively?

04:47.787 --> 04:48.870
Why would you ask that?

04:51.874 --> 04:55.377
I'm sorry, we can't share
much about the investigation at this point.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.962
Did she live here with you?

04:57.046 --> 04:59.965
No. She came of age
and she moved out years ago.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.174
We aren't...

05:02.885 --> 05:04.261
We weren't close.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.347
Did Sarah have a sister?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.182
No. She was an orphan.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.977
Could she have a sister?

05:12.395 --> 05:14.980
If she did, it would be news to both of us.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.735
Neolution is bullshit, Cosima.

05:19.819 --> 05:23.196
No, it isn't, Sarah.
It's an applied philosophy

05:23.239 --> 05:25.741
with profound implications for what I do.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.076
So, you'd go around
black-bagging your subjects?

05:28.202 --> 05:30.829
That was mistaken identity. Okay?

05:30.913 --> 05:33.081
Olivier thought you were the killer, Sarah.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.792
Yes. Well, your good friend
Dr. Leekie is on his way.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.085
Can I expect the same from him?

05:37.128 --> 05:38.170
Okay. You know what?

05:38.629 --> 05:41.590
You were the one
who turned our killer against our creators.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.259
I mean, why the hell
would you bring Helena into the mix?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.219
Oi! lvory tower.

05:46.262 --> 05:49.014
This all happened because
you got the science wrong.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.724
No, I didn't.

05:50.808 --> 05:53.018
- Yes, you did, okay?

05:53.102 --> 05:55.187
They knew I wasn't Beth
from the medical tests.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.689
- You said our DNA was identical.
- It is.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.275
You know, maybe it was
your sunny personality that gave you away.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.277
Whose bloody side are you on, Cosima?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.112
Well, hang up. She's a freaky Leekie.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.201
Shit. Fe, Cosima drank the purple Kool Aid.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.119
Well, then to hell with her.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.455
But you can still save Alison.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.624
- Alison's fine.
- She's not fine.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.752
- She's divorcing Donnie.
- It's every freak for herself.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.005
Divorces do really
strange things to normals, Sarah.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.966
They lose their fake happiness,
they forget the way to the mall

06:25.009 --> 06:27.886
and then they come downtown
to find themselves.

06:30.973 --> 06:34.142
She's obsessing that
one of her bitchy friends is her monitor.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.103
Aynesley.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.313
It's her for sure.

06:40.149 --> 06:43.193
Divorce... You poor thing.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.655
- Where are the kids?
- They are at my mother's.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.323
Do they know? Did you tell them?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.367
You're just full of questions, aren't you?

06:50.451 --> 06:52.786
Well, of course I am. I care about you.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.455
- I know you were unhappy, but...
- How did you know?

06:55.706 --> 06:57.082
By asking questions.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.542
Always asking, asking.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.961
Everything you know
you pried right out of me.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.510
Here's a thought.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.012
Why don't you let me
coach figure skating tonight?

07:11.347 --> 07:12.931
The kids are with your mom...

07:13.015 --> 07:14.683
Have a night in. Relax.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.184
No, you relax.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.978
Figure skating is on my schedule.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.605
And whether my daughter
is in attendance or not, I'll be there.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.985
Ali, I think you need some "me" time.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.362
And I think you need
to give me my house keys back.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.489
What? What have I done?

07:29.657 --> 07:31.116
Keys, please.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.374
I know you're in pain,
so I won't ask for my keys back.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.543
But I want you to know,
I won't abandon you, Ali.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.638
You know...

07:56.559 --> 08:00.979
I'm afraid restoring your brother's
appendage was out of the question.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.231
The tail was too badly damaged.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.192
Must have been a new one for you.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.235
Yes, but fascinating, actually.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.321
That level of surgical enhancement.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.032
He's very committed.
How long do you expect to keep him here?

08:13.159 --> 08:16.912
Between the blood loss
and the risk of infection in that area...

08:17.330 --> 08:19.372
- A few days to a week.
- Thanks, Doc.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.082
I'll wait till he comes to.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.689
Where are you with Cosima?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.567
Closer.

08:48.444 --> 08:52.239
She... She made a pass at me, Aldous.

08:53.699 --> 08:54.950
Really?

08:57.828 --> 08:59.204
Delphine...

09:00.873 --> 09:02.916
Cosima's safety is at stake.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.794
Other subjects, too.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.965
I need to know which ones
she's in contact with.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.511
But she has to initiate disclosure.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.472
I'm not saying disclose.

09:18.266 --> 09:23.061
This is a direct threat.
And so I need you to dig deeper, faster.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.372
"Dear Mummy, I miss you.

10:25.041 --> 10:29.044
"Mrs. S says, 'You are in the sunshine.'

10:30.254 --> 10:31.630
"Please come home.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.883
"Love, Kira."

10:44.435 --> 10:46.811
Oi! Can you not, please?

10:47.063 --> 10:50.273
I'm not gonna hole up with you
if you can't sit still.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.151
- Does it smell?
- Yes, smells like a foot.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.778
Only worse, because it's yours.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.864
- Alison's not picking up.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.408
Who's calling?

11:00.576 --> 11:02.160
Art, again.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.080
Sorry, Beth doesn't live here anymore.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.082
No, she lives with me.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.085
So does her boy-toy bodyguard...
Stop!

11:10.503 --> 11:12.545
- Would you please stop?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.840
- Oi, oi, Mrs. S.
- Oi, oi.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.136
And you're alive.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.389
Yeah. Why?

11:23.641 --> 11:26.017
Two homicide detectives
on my doorstep this morning

11:26.102 --> 11:29.771
quite convinced they'd found your body
in a gravel quarry.

11:32.316 --> 11:35.402
- Who wants mimosas?
- Sit down and shut your gob.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.363
I was tempted to clean the remains
and feed them to you both on toast.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.073
Would you care to enlighten me?

11:41.033 --> 11:42.826
I don't want to lie to you, so...

11:42.952 --> 11:43.993
Not yet.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.913
- What'd they say?
- Very little.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.165
I'd venture little is all they have.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.668
Thanks.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.719
Whatever is going on,
if it takes one step towards Kira,

12:01.178 --> 12:02.679
you need to yell, "Fire."

12:04.181 --> 12:06.349
The home we've built
for ourselves in this country,

12:06.434 --> 12:08.810
we burn it all down if we have to.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.896
That's a promise.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.487
- Hey.
- Hey. Facial reconstruction's come along.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.365
- Hey, well, hang on to your hat.
- Sounds promising.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.993
Sarah Manning offed herself.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.287
Jumped in front of a train at Huxley Station.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.831
- What?
- Check out the time of death.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.333
Two days before Jane Doe was shot.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.670
Jane Doe can't be Sarah Manning.
Sarah Manning was already dead.

12:35.838 --> 12:36.963
Except the prints match.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.258
Uh, twins right? Twins.
Twins prints are close enough to flag a match.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.969
I mean, environmental factors
like wear and tear can usually differentiate.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.096
Okay, but the foster mother said, no relations.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.181
That she knew of.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.684
Sarah was an orphan.
Say, Beth's a triplet separated at birth.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.060
--Come on, humor me.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.689
Over a couple of days, same city,
one suicides, the other gets whacked?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.317
I mean, it suggests they're in touch,
they're not separate anymore, right?

12:57.526 --> 12:59.194
Then there's only one left to clear it up.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.616
- Beth.
- Hi, got your messages.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.534
Bad time?

13:10.623 --> 13:13.291
So what's this all about?
You miss me already?

13:14.502 --> 13:17.587
Some questions came up
about your work on the Jane Doe case.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.382
Such as?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.761
Well, you told us
there was no print match on the victim.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.221
Yeah, there wasn't.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.807
Well, there's no confirmation
of that in the case file.

13:29.725 --> 13:30.809
There should be.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.353
We ran them again and we got a match.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.691
So, finally getting somewhere.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.069
Yeah, it sounds like it.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.821
Just need to know...

13:51.455 --> 13:52.580
Is this a joke?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.708
Does the name Sarah Manning
mean anything to you?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.961
Who the hell is this?

13:58.420 --> 13:59.546
You've never seen her before?

13:59.588 --> 14:02.507
I... Yeah, yeah. In the mirror.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.093
Come on, no.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.928
Hey, I guess people have look-alikes.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.263
Do they?

14:10.432 --> 14:11.933
- Alison!
- Hmm?

14:11.976 --> 14:13.518
Alison, how are you?

14:13.936 --> 14:15.854
- Mmm.
- Oh, poor hon.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.439
If you need anything, just call.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.400
Oh, my God, this is classic Aynsley.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.278
You can't just put on an outfit and be a coach.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.821
You're not the coach.
You don't know what you're doing.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.115
- I'm here every single...
- Ali, hey.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.617
- Hi, Chad.
- Singlehood, free at last, huh?

14:30.119 --> 14:31.327
What are you doing here, Aynesley?

14:31.453 --> 14:32.453
I know, right?

14:33.956 --> 14:35.748
Chad, go play with your dumbbells.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.375
I told you I've got this covered.

14:37.459 --> 14:38.918
You're in no condition
to be coaching the kids.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.587
Way to rub salt in the wounds, Aynes.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.300
Yeah. Sorry, I tried.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.678
I'm perfectly fine.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.514
And no one asked you to sub for me, so leave.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.559
Alison, you're mad at Donnie, not me.

14:54.810 --> 14:58.563
- I told you to stay away from me.
- And I told you you're not yourself.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.148
I know what you're doing, Aynesley.

15:00.482 --> 15:03.651
You wanna mess with my life,
I'm gonna mess with yours.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.825
Sorry to be a bitch here.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.495
But it looks like you buried Jane Doe's
fingerprints to hide your connection.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.747
What connection?

15:15.831 --> 15:18.291
I don't have a sister.
I don't know who this person is.

15:18.375 --> 15:21.961
- Sarah Manning was an orphan.
- Same prints as Jane Doe.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.631
But she killed herself
days before Jane Doe was murdered.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.843
Look, Beth, we just need to know
where you fit in.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.641
Can I see her file?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.143
Sorry, you're a civilian.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.145
Yeah, what you've always wanted.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.778
Art, do I need to lawyer up here?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.821
I don't know, Beth.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.115
Do you?

16:06.382 --> 16:08.716
Have forensics run her prints
as fast as possible.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.801
Got it.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.354
Hmm...

16:40.416 --> 16:42.083
Oh, shit.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.962
Okay. Fine, you caught me.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.214
Just please don't nark on me to Aynesley,

16:48.257 --> 16:50.550
you know how ape-shit she gets
about stuff like this.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.930
Whoa.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.348
Alison.

16:57.433 --> 17:02.061
You know, Chad. This is the first hit
I've had since Godspell in college.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.896
--I don't know what that is.

17:07.608 --> 17:09.109
Okay...

17:09.737 --> 17:11.112
Got any more?

17:18.996 --> 17:20.204
Paul.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.959
Dr. Aldous Leekie will be
here in a couple of hours.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.502
He texted you.

17:28.672 --> 17:33.468
You are conspiring with at least two clones.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.261
Just one, actually.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.971
Are you crazy?

17:37.514 --> 17:39.557
Despite appearances,

17:40.476 --> 17:43.811
I'm not the one
in a compromising position here, Paul.

17:48.192 --> 17:52.487
You blackmailed an ex-military
intelligence guy to do your dirty work.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.115
Olivier Duval.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.702
That's a classy pseudonym, bro.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.289
Thank you.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.752
Your real name is Kevin.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.171
You're from Wenatchee, Washington.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.549
You have a raft of unsavory sex warrants.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.718
The organization knows that.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.637
Yeah, but the police don't.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.390
And that's why you're gonna listen

18:21.725 --> 18:24.393
when I tell you what happened last night.

18:29.858 --> 18:30.983
Oh, I get it.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.569
Smoke through the roof.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.239
- Accelerated dissipation.
- Mmm.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.241
Mmm-hmm.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.577
Fewer air fresheners required.

18:41.870 --> 18:46.207
Speaking of fresh air, cheers to finally
getting Donnie off your couch.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.711
Are you mocking the failure
of my marriage, Chad?

18:50.754 --> 18:52.255
Sorry.

18:53.715 --> 18:54.715
No, don't be.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.886
I gather you and Aynesley
aren't exactly booking nooners.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.306
Hey, you know, the thing
about you and me, Hendrix...

19:02.891 --> 19:04.642
- Hmm.
- We're sharks.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.562
- We stop moving, we die.
- Mmm.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.732
Yeah, you certainly got that down.

19:12.025 --> 19:15.153
Those late night runs in your sleeveless T's.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.697
You ain't so bad yourself.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.701
Tight glutes, nice pecs.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.121
- I bet you could bench press me.
- Easy.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.293
I bet you could bounce me like a ball.

19:31.753 --> 19:35.173
You okay? Maybe you've had too much.

19:35.757 --> 19:37.133
Mmm.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.927
Maybe you haven't had enough.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.847
What are we doing here?

19:42.931 --> 19:44.432
I'm objectifying you,

19:45.100 --> 19:47.894
sexually, to get back at Donnie.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.439
I should really have a problem with this.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.150
But you don't.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.208
Hey, Delphine.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.084
I... I hope I'm not disturbing you.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.753
Oh, no, no, no. No, impossible.

20:13.795 --> 20:18.966
So, apparently I've got this thing for,
like, um, jumping to conclusions.

20:19.134 --> 20:22.136
You know, it's just that I've never...

20:22.429 --> 20:24.972
I know, I know, I know. You're not gay.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.433
And I'm a total idiot. So sorry.

20:29.519 --> 20:30.978
- Oh, let me...
- Oh, yes.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.271
Do you... Yeah.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.483
I just wanna make like, uh,
crazy science with you.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.611
Totally crazy science.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.655
I'm so glad to hear that
because you know what?

20:40.739 --> 20:45.826
I was reading up on the Dyad institute,
and did you know that Dr. Leekie...

20:45.869 --> 20:50.373
He has built a dedicated department
for transgenic organ transplants and...

20:50.666 --> 20:53.042
Sorry, I was just dorking out

20:53.252 --> 20:56.837
so hard to their extrapolation
of murine models.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.881
- What?
- Yeah.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.508
Oh, wow.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.762
You know, it's really, really good to
finally meet someone who gets it.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.015
- Hmm.
- Who gets... Who gets me.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.562
Yeah, ditto. Obvs.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.279
I can't stop thinking about that kiss.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.865
Uh, like in a not bad way?

21:26.118 --> 21:29.203
Oh, like, I've never thought
about my sexuality.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.413
I mean, for myself, you know.

21:30.914 --> 21:34.375
But as a scientist I know
that sexuality is a spectrum.

21:34.835 --> 21:38.296
But you know social bias is the...
The codified attraction.

21:38.922 --> 21:42.049
It's contrary to the biological facts,
you know?

21:42.384 --> 21:45.303
Hmm, that's oddly romantic.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.351
Totally encouraging.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.047
Oh, my God.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.091
You want me to coach you?

22:27.763 --> 22:29.764
--Uh... Oh, okay. No.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.683
Let's turn around
right here now, girls. Go on.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.727
You're in the end-zone.
You're in the end-zone.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.270
- Yeah, you're my coach.
- Touchdown.

22:42.110 --> 22:46.405
♪ Tomorrow I will change
and today won't mean a thing

22:46.531 --> 22:51.327

23:21.608 --> 23:24.652
Everyone knows you screwed my husband.

23:26.738 --> 23:30.116
Well, maybe if you paid
more attention to him and less to me.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.326
Get out of the car, Alison.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.455
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.833
No, I know exactly who you are.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.211
You're a sleazy, watcher spy.

23:42.295 --> 23:47.675
Sleazy? That's rich coming
from a back stabbing psycho-slut like you.

23:48.677 --> 23:49.760
Do you...

23:50.095 --> 23:51.887
Stop it. Oi!

23:53.515 --> 23:54.682
Ow!

23:54.766 --> 23:55.850
Ha-ha!

24:09.030 --> 24:10.364
Hey, hey, hey, morgie.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.409
We need everything
you got on Sarah Manning.

24:15.203 --> 24:17.746
Caucasian female, suicide by train.

24:18.373 --> 24:21.250
- You processed the body and its release.
- I process lots of bodies.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.377
Is there a problem?

24:24.629 --> 24:27.173
Fingerprints from our Jane Doe
of the gravel crusher.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.842
Forensic says they're spooky close
to two other women.

24:29.885 --> 24:33.929
Yeah, one Sarah Manning,
and other is a totally other woman.

24:34.389 --> 24:35.723
Let's see. Uh...

24:36.892 --> 24:38.893
Sarah Manning, suicide by train.

24:40.604 --> 24:41.896
Holy shit.

24:43.523 --> 24:44.982
It's uncanny.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.904
I need the name and the address
of the person who identified her.

24:56.077 --> 24:59.079
What? I...
Colin, please slow down.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.539
What exactly did they say?

25:00.582 --> 25:01.999
I couldn't lie, Felix.

25:02.083 --> 25:05.127
Okay, there are records,
your signature, address...

25:06.254 --> 25:08.464
Okay... I gotta go.

25:08.548 --> 25:12.009
But you just take a hot bath,
I will talk to you later.

25:12.260 --> 25:13.677
Shit! Sarah?

25:13.762 --> 25:14.929
You can handle this, yeah?

25:15.222 --> 25:18.182
Cops? Yeah... I...
Where are you gonna go?

25:18.767 --> 25:20.643
No idea.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.521
Shit!

25:24.773 --> 25:28.067
Felix, it's me, Alison.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.777
Please be home.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.951
You effing kidding me.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.827
Bad things have happened to me.

25:38.912 --> 25:42.122
And I would love to hear about them. I would.

25:42.165 --> 25:44.333
- Right now, you need to go.
- Huh?

25:49.464 --> 25:50.839
I can't go back there.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.968
It's just for one night, Alison.

25:54.177 --> 25:57.471
I slept with Aynesley's husband.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.723
- What?

26:00.684 --> 26:03.227
I shagged Chad.

26:04.479 --> 26:06.939
And Aynesley attacked me
in the middle of the street.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.649
I degraded myself,

26:08.733 --> 26:11.860
and I disgraced my children,
and I can't go back there.

26:12.195 --> 26:15.489
- I seriously underestimated you.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.825
I hope you kicked her arse.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.703
I did. Kind of.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.332
I don't wanna divorce Donnie, but I...

26:25.417 --> 26:27.167
I can't keep lying to him.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.962
And I hate lying to my kids, I hate it.

26:30.505 --> 26:32.923
How can we possibly
sustain this insanity?

26:33.008 --> 26:34.425
We can't.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.427
I don't know if Art's gonna throw me in jail,

26:36.511 --> 26:39.847
or if Cosima's gonna nark us out
to the neolutionist.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.351
Um, don't forget Helena, she's always fun.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.314
All I know is, I came back to fix things.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.816
Be a real mum to Kira.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.195
So, what if we tell them?

26:57.866 --> 26:59.450
You mean, come out?

27:11.630 --> 27:13.881
I miss you, Mummy.

27:13.923 --> 27:16.842
I miss you, Mummy.

27:17.636 --> 27:21.221
I miss you, Mummy.

27:26.561 --> 27:29.229
Hmm, Scotsburn Avenue,

27:30.565 --> 27:33.233
148.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.581
I replaced your security footage

27:47.916 --> 27:50.250
to show only one clone, Beth.

27:50.835 --> 27:51.919
Sarah was never there.

27:52.253 --> 27:53.629
He's smart. it won't work.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.715
It will, if you stick to one, there was only one.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.553
And you need to stop blaming yourself.

28:01.596 --> 28:02.930
How could you know...

28:04.391 --> 28:06.892
- Uh, Dr. Leekie, I'm...
- Paul Dierden.

28:07.602 --> 28:08.811
I hear great things.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.354
Aldous...

28:10.939 --> 28:12.731
Aldous, she took my tail.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.441
Shut up, Olivier.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.618
You okay?

28:25.704 --> 28:26.787
Yes.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.501
- You sure?

28:35.046 --> 28:37.840
I... I cry after sex with boys, too.

28:39.759 --> 28:41.468
Poor you.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.472
- But you know what?
- Hmm?

28:46.224 --> 28:48.934
I am never this hungry.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.104
I could kill for some ice cream.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.523
Mmm... Okay.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.483
Your wish is my command.

28:57.318 --> 29:00.738
I'm gonna go to the store
and I'm gonna get us some Eskimo Pies.

29:01.614 --> 29:02.656
Eskimo...

29:03.992 --> 29:05.159
Yeah.

29:05.660 --> 29:06.660
I don't think I know it.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.953
- No?
- No.

29:08.621 --> 29:11.832
Prepare yourself, you're about
to become a craving addict.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.002
I think I already am.

30:34.624 --> 30:35.749
Merde.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.594
She dropped the Beth act
cold right in front of us.

30:47.637 --> 30:50.764
If it weren't for Paul,
she would have killed me.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.683
She said her name was Helena.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.435
She had an accent, Slavic.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.939
She admitted she killed Beth
and took over her life.

30:59.482 --> 31:01.775
Aldous, she is completely insane.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.113
Welcome to the big picture.

31:06.489 --> 31:07.489
Yes, sir.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.159
Sorry, guys. Visiting hours are over.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.079
Hmm, sure. We'll... We'll get out of your way.

31:19.752 --> 31:21.461
And you just rest...

31:22.547 --> 31:23.797
And heal.

31:29.220 --> 31:33.140
What did they say in the military,
"You've, uh, you've proven your mettle?"

31:33.683 --> 31:35.142
No, sir, nobody ever said that.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.810
- Okay.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.731
Well, tomorrow, I'd like
to talk to about next steps.

31:42.650 --> 31:43.775
Excuse me.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.153
Found something?

31:46.237 --> 31:48.155
Promise me Cosima's safe.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.490
Her quest, Aldous, is...

31:50.533 --> 31:53.410
it's all perfectly... Perfectly natural.

31:53.703 --> 31:56.622
Delphine, believe me. I'm protecting her.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.498
Now, what is it, then?

31:58.541 --> 32:01.001
But she's not only researching
her own biology

32:01.085 --> 32:04.296
but she's aware of eight others.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.505
She's had contact.

32:05.757 --> 32:06.840
I need names.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.509
Yes. Well, some of them seem to be dead.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.803
- Um, Janika Zingier.
- Yes.

32:11.846 --> 32:12.971
Danielle Fournier.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.181
Yes.

32:14.849 --> 32:16.516
- Yes.
- Katja Obinger.

32:16.601 --> 32:17.601
- Yes.
- Helena.

32:17.727 --> 32:19.561
But there's no last name, um...

32:19.646 --> 32:20.812
Helena.

32:20.855 --> 32:25.025
There's Alison Hendrix,
Beth Childs and Sarah Manning.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.569
Sarah Manning.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.238
Anything else on her?

32:31.407 --> 32:32.866
No, nothing.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.495
Listen, I have to go. She's coming. Bye.

32:54.013 --> 32:55.097
Hello?

32:55.223 --> 32:56.723
What happened? You okay?

32:56.808 --> 32:59.226
Yeah, it's time, Siobhan.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.895
Time I told you what's really going on.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.108
Well, then, I am all ears.

33:13.074 --> 33:16.326
Uh, Siobhan, this is Alison Hendrix.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.541
Pleased to meet you.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.758
Well, tell me more, love.

33:31.801 --> 33:35.804
I mean, it can't
get any stranger than human cloning.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.016
Well, um, we live in Scarborough.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.977
About a million years ago,
I went to university.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.062
You went to university?

33:44.105 --> 33:45.981
Hmm, yes, kinesiology.

33:46.733 --> 33:47.774
Where'd you go wrong?

33:48.901 --> 33:51.653
Oh, that's just basically
massage therapy, innit?

33:51.904 --> 33:53.113
Uh, no.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.990
Sarah, it's very important.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.491
It heals.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.452
- Oh.
- No.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.164
Um, and then I got married.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.585
And everything is shit.

34:08.795 --> 34:10.922
She came to see Kira
once in your place, didn't she?

34:12.425 --> 34:14.467
I knew something was up.

34:14.552 --> 34:17.304
Yeah, sorry.
The crazy one, Helena, was after me.

34:17.388 --> 34:20.181
Okay, so, Helena, Alison,

34:20.558 --> 34:22.976
Cosima, Beth is the...

34:23.143 --> 34:24.728
- The police woman?
- Yeah.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.688
Who topped herself, yeah.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.442
- You.
- Now there's probably thousands of us.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.985
Unless Helena's killed them all.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.780
We're all messed up.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.989
Except you, Sarah.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.868
I am the biggest mess there is, Alison.

34:39.952 --> 34:42.661
No, no, no, no. Because you say, "'F' it."

34:42.830 --> 34:47.458
I tried to say, "'F' it" today
and I blew up my whole life.

34:47.668 --> 34:51.338
I just wanted to say, "'F' this. 'F' you."

34:51.589 --> 34:54.800
- And I F'ed it. I F'ed it all up.
- Oh.

34:54.842 --> 34:59.012
You know, would you like to see
the guest bedroom at this point, chicken?

34:59.347 --> 35:01.556
Huh? Huh? Come on.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.810
Yes. Oh, you're so lovely.

35:04.894 --> 35:08.230
You know, you're very lucky, Sarah.

35:08.314 --> 35:09.898
My mother wouldn't be this lovely.

35:09.982 --> 35:13.193
She would... My mother would
have me put in, uh, therapy.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.656
Yeah, yes.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.533
That's Sarah.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.538
I was just so shocked.

35:25.164 --> 35:27.916
Seeing her like that on that slab, looking so...

35:29.168 --> 35:30.710
Dead, really.

35:32.046 --> 35:34.214
So your foster sister didn't have any sisters?

35:34.465 --> 35:35.674
Just me.

35:37.844 --> 35:41.054
I keep asking myself,
"What did I miss?" you know.

35:42.014 --> 35:43.890
'Cause I never really saw the signs.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.892
- Beth Childs.
- Hmm?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.394
Who's that?

35:50.815 --> 35:52.023
Mind if I look?

35:52.400 --> 35:53.483
I like art.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.903
No... Yeah, um, by all means.

36:02.743 --> 36:03.910
Oh, uh...

36:04.745 --> 36:06.580
Those are the many sides of Sarah.

36:07.582 --> 36:10.000
I call that series "Twisted Sister."

36:10.084 --> 36:11.168
I like them.

36:11.252 --> 36:13.545
- It's all working out your grief.
- Yes.

36:14.088 --> 36:15.380
Wherever it takes me.

36:21.095 --> 36:22.971
Oh, thanks.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.557
And sorry again, for your loss.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.309
Thank you.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.026
I've been here before.

36:36.569 --> 36:37.903
What does that mean?

36:48.539 --> 36:52.751
Hello?

36:52.793 --> 36:55.420
Harley, you pervy bastard,
I know that's you.

36:59.467 --> 37:00.800
Last night, I get a phone call.

37:01.177 --> 37:04.763
Some punk with an English accent
says he wants to talk about Beth.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.514
Then he hangs up.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.976
- Let's bring him in. Let's shake his tree, man.
- No, it's too early.

37:10.144 --> 37:12.437
I wanna get a better picture
of this whole deal first.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.832
What are you doing?

37:32.917 --> 37:35.669
- Any loss of sensation in your feet?
- No.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.632
Just checking.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.301
Get some rest.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.391
Oh, and Dr. Leekie sends his regards.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.209
I know there's more here.
Between the lines.

38:17.169 --> 38:19.170
What is that you need, Sarah?

38:19.547 --> 38:20.839
How can I help?

38:21.257 --> 38:24.884
Well, uh, Alison, Cosima, Beth,

38:25.219 --> 38:28.888
their mothers all wanted
babies enough to do in vitro.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.391
So why did mine give me up?

38:32.560 --> 38:34.644
There were rumors...

38:36.355 --> 38:37.397
Yeah?

38:37.481 --> 38:39.357
That some of the kids
we were hiding, the ones that...

38:40.067 --> 38:44.487
...came in Carlton's pipeline, like you,
children in the black...

38:44.572 --> 38:46.865
What do you mean exactly,
"in the black"?

38:46.907 --> 38:49.743
You know undocumented,
outside the system,

38:49.827 --> 38:51.369
rumor was these kids

38:51.412 --> 38:53.580
were the subject of medical experiments.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.376
Carlton's pipeline.

38:59.587 --> 39:02.005
- What kind of experiments?
- I don't know, love.

39:02.089 --> 39:05.884
It was a paranoid time in a radical fringe.
Everything was rumor then.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.809
Carlton brought me to you.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.479
Wouldn't he know who my birth mother was?

39:17.855 --> 39:21.024
He may, but even if he did
he might not tell me.

39:22.943 --> 39:26.446
- Do your contacts still know him?
- It's... it's possible.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.657
Can you get in touch with him?

39:29.742 --> 39:33.828
It's 15 years ago.
Last I heard, he was in prison.

39:33.954 --> 39:35.121
I'll try.

40:13.994 --> 40:16.996
- Just wanna know who I am.
- You're still you.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.418
Remember that.

40:22.211 --> 40:23.586
You're a survivor.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.102
Kira?

40:43.357 --> 40:44.399
It's Helena.

40:44.650 --> 40:45.650
Kira?

40:48.195 --> 40:53.074
Kira!

40:56.912 --> 40:58.538
Where are we going?

40:59.498 --> 41:01.040
I'm taking you to meet someone.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.254
How can you be Sarah's daughter, child?

41:06.338 --> 41:07.380
How can that be?

41:07.965 --> 41:09.507
Kira! Stop!

41:09.675 --> 41:11.593
You're just like my mum.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.052
No, I'm not.

41:13.929 --> 41:15.388
She's not real.

41:17.433 --> 41:18.725
Of course she is.

41:20.853 --> 41:21.978
Kira!

41:24.607 --> 41:25.857
Helena...

41:27.067 --> 41:28.443
Yes, angel?

41:30.905 --> 41:32.614
What happened to you?

41:35.618 --> 41:36.951
I don't know.

41:50.883 --> 41:51.966
Kira!

41:58.349 --> 42:01.017
- Kira!
- I should go home now.

42:05.606 --> 42:06.689
Yes.

42:07.942 --> 42:10.443
- Do you know the way?
- Of course.

42:14.323 --> 42:15.782
Goodnight, angel.

42:17.826 --> 42:18.910
- Kira!
- Mommy!

42:21.330 --> 42:22.330
--Watch out!

42:26.377 --> 42:27.418
No!

42:37.471 --> 42:39.806
Seven-year-old female struck by vehicle,
GCS three.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.349
Chest injury, possible internal bleeding.

42:41.517 --> 42:43.393
Stay with me, baby, please.

42:43.894 --> 42:45.603
Bet you 100 bucks,
I know who she's gonna look like

42:45.646 --> 42:47.146
when Beckwith is done
with the reconstruction.

42:47.231 --> 42:48.439
You got no charge
that will stick, yet.

42:48.691 --> 42:49.857
Why is Sarah still alive?

42:49.942 --> 42:50.984
Tell her.

42:51.026 --> 42:54.153
Someone tampered
with the security footage at club Neolution.

42:54.238 --> 42:59.325
I know there were
two clones there that night, weren't they?

43:00.202 --> 43:01.661
- Oh, my God.
- Alison.

43:01.704 --> 43:02.912
What? What is this?

43:02.997 --> 43:06.332
We're gathered in spirit
of love and understanding.
