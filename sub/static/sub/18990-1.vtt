01:26.430 --> 01:28.090
- Hi, Mrs. Lawrence.

01:29.050 --> 01:29.890
- Oh dear.

01:34.130 --> 01:35.300
What happened?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.870
- It must have all started

01:41.870 --> 01:43.420
the moment I entered the house.

01:45.530 --> 01:48.200
(ominous music)

02:02.520 --> 02:05.850
(footsteps approaching)

03:07.770 --> 03:10.680
(doorbell ringing)

03:18.000 --> 03:18.830
- Hi.

03:29.470 --> 03:32.140
(man screaming)

03:37.220 --> 03:38.220
- [Man] You!

03:48.690 --> 03:50.330
- What is it?

03:50.330 --> 03:51.900
- Nothing.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.570
- I was getting worried about you.

03:53.570 --> 03:54.470
How have you been?

03:55.530 --> 03:57.070
- Just okay.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.020
- It takes a while.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.940
You can have Connie,
Robin, and Wendy's room.

04:04.910 --> 04:05.740
- Hi, Beth.

04:05.740 --> 04:06.640
- Hi, Trace.

04:06.640 --> 04:07.940
- They all took off early.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.770
- Okay.

04:10.770 --> 04:12.640
Well, it'll be good to be around you guys,

04:12.640 --> 04:14.720
I've been kind of lonely.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.089
- Well, if you need anything,
I'm at the end of the hall.

04:17.089 --> 04:17.920
- Thanks.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.570
- And you'll see, after a weekend with us,

04:19.570 --> 04:21.470
you're gonna wanna join this sorority.

04:42.270 --> 04:43.580
- Jesus Christ.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.960
Did you see the look
on that mother's face?

04:45.960 --> 04:47.510
- Should we have taped him up like that?

04:47.510 --> 04:48.900
- You wanna listen to him all night?

04:48.900 --> 04:50.770
- No, maybe we should call Dr. Lindsey.

04:50.770 --> 04:52.260
- No, let the lady sleep.

04:52.260 --> 04:54.760
She'll be here in the morning.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.380
(leather creaking)

04:58.380 --> 05:00.060
(clock ticking)

05:00.060 --> 05:02.980
(foreboding music)

05:37.200 --> 05:39.030
- Where are you going?

05:40.960 --> 05:41.870
- In there.

05:43.020 --> 05:44.270
- In the house?

05:45.600 --> 05:46.430
- Yes.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.580
- Be careful.

05:49.580 --> 05:52.080
(eerie music)

07:44.520 --> 07:47.520
(blood splattering)

08:44.340 --> 08:47.260
(glass shattering)

09:12.710 --> 09:15.370
(child moaning)

09:35.420 --> 09:36.920
- Hey, Con?

09:36.920 --> 09:38.070
Oops.

09:38.070 --> 09:39.800
Well, you're Beth, right?

09:39.800 --> 09:40.800
- Right.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.600
- Hi, I'm Sara.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.050
- Hi.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.470
- Oh, how'd you do that?

09:46.510 --> 09:47.830
- I don't know.

09:47.830 --> 09:50.280
I've had it since before I can remember.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.110
- Mmm.

09:52.580 --> 09:54.480
You wouldn't happen to have a sweater

09:54.480 --> 09:55.830
to go with this, would you?

09:56.910 --> 09:57.740
- Mm-mm.

09:57.740 --> 09:59.510
- Me neither, oh well.

10:08.070 --> 10:09.350
Cindy, can I please, please,

10:09.350 --> 10:11.130
please borrow your pink jacket?

10:11.130 --> 10:12.720
- Not a chance.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.940
- How's this?

10:13.940 --> 10:16.230
- Thanks Linda, you saved my life.

10:16.230 --> 10:17.520
- Sure.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.120
- Have you seen my black boots?

10:19.120 --> 10:20.820
- Tracy's got 'em.

10:20.820 --> 10:21.650
- Trace?

10:22.960 --> 10:25.200
Cindy's going to Palm Springs.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.030
- So?

10:26.030 --> 10:27.350
- So, her Memorial Day weekend's

10:27.350 --> 10:29.700
gonna be a little more
memorable than ours.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.190
- What's the emergency?

10:31.190 --> 10:32.590
- My boots, please.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.280
- Say, Linda.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.140
- Go ahead.

10:41.090 --> 10:43.250
Steve's going rafting this weekend.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.380
- Well, invite him here.

10:45.380 --> 10:47.260
- I did, he's going rafting.

10:48.410 --> 10:49.280
- He's the slug.

11:04.690 --> 11:05.920
- Hey, Beth.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.980
Ready for some major fun this weekend?

11:09.210 --> 11:10.360
- Yeah, I could use it.

11:15.920 --> 11:20.920
(leather creaking)
(metal clasps rattling)

11:21.610 --> 11:22.510
- What's with Beth?

11:22.510 --> 11:23.960
God, talk about glum.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.060
- Shh, her aunt died.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.650
- But that was weeks ago.

11:27.650 --> 11:29.690
- God Tracy, get sensitive.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.330
Her aunt raised her,
it's like her mom died.

11:32.330 --> 11:35.020
- Oh, well I didn't know.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.670
- Well, I've got a nine o'clock.

11:36.670 --> 11:38.370
- Great, we can all walk together.

11:41.290 --> 11:43.680
First thing tomorrow we have
to call the rental house.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.970
- I already arranged everything.

11:45.970 --> 11:47.040
- What?

11:47.040 --> 11:50.110
You actually care about
setting up the pow-wow?

11:53.680 --> 11:54.690
- The sooner we set it up,

11:54.690 --> 11:57.240
the sooner it's out of the way.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.680
- That's the old sorority spirit.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.850
- Oh, shit.

12:00.850 --> 12:01.680
- What?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.860
- I got the wrong book,
you guys go on ahead.

12:03.860 --> 12:04.710
- No, we'll wait.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.070
(ominous music)

12:20.920 --> 12:24.210
(knife slicing)

12:24.210 --> 12:25.290
Beth?

12:25.290 --> 12:26.340
Come on, we gotta go!

12:28.070 --> 12:28.910
Beth?

12:30.180 --> 12:31.260
Are you okay?

12:34.390 --> 12:35.890
- I, I don't know.

12:36.870 --> 12:38.230
- What happened?

12:38.230 --> 12:40.400
- I saw this horrible guy.

12:42.410 --> 12:45.160
- Hey take it easy, there's no guy here.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.160
If there were, Tracy would've found him.

12:49.270 --> 12:52.020
(fists pounding)

12:53.340 --> 12:54.990
- When did he become agitated?

12:54.990 --> 12:56.460
- Late last night.

12:56.460 --> 12:57.960
Said they had to strap him in.

12:59.470 --> 13:00.920
- I wonder what triggered it.

13:03.990 --> 13:06.740
(hands slapping)

13:15.900 --> 13:17.980
- I mean, too chic.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.700
- My mom made me promise to wear it

13:19.700 --> 13:21.300
after those muggings last month.

13:26.590 --> 13:28.600
Did you guys hear the
story about the pet pig?

13:28.600 --> 13:31.310
- Ew, who'd want a pet pig?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.830
- A family moved from
Dayton to Miami, got it?

13:33.830 --> 13:35.590
From Ohio to Florida,

13:35.590 --> 13:37.850
and this pig found its way back to them.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.050
- So now they have to move again.

13:39.050 --> 13:42.240
- It's like it picked
up on a psychic beacon.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.220
- Or in this case a psychic bacon.

13:47.390 --> 13:48.760
- Mrs. Lawrence stopped by.

13:48.760 --> 13:49.940
- What's she doing?

13:49.940 --> 13:52.520
- She's going with her boyfriend.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.600
- Really?
(girls laughing)

13:53.600 --> 13:56.960
- Oh, yeah.
(girls laughing)

13:56.960 --> 13:59.980
- Oh, come on, you guys,
it's so meaningless.

13:59.980 --> 14:02.630
You guys, I gotta go, I'm late.

14:02.630 --> 14:03.460
Bye.

14:03.460 --> 14:04.320
- Okay, see you, bye.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.280
- I'll see you later.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.080
- Okay, I'll see you at the house later.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.480
- Is he okay?

14:13.480 --> 14:16.780
- I don't know what his problem
is, but he wants out bad.

14:16.780 --> 14:18.330
What does he think's out there?

14:19.740 --> 14:20.570
- I need a sedative.

14:20.570 --> 14:21.400
- Coming right up.

14:23.610 --> 14:26.520
- Okay, people, books under
your desks, here we go.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.680
Compare, contrast, and comment on

14:28.680 --> 14:31.430
the differences and similarities in theory

14:31.430 --> 14:34.230
and in therapeutic practice
between traditional

14:34.230 --> 14:37.410
psychoanalysis and behavior modifications.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.540
- Great, a pop psychology quiz.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.120
(projector whirring)

14:45.120 --> 14:45.950
- [Man] Death.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.880
It comes to all of us.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.800
Yet how often do we
consider our own mortality?

14:52.870 --> 14:54.690
Too frequently we're caught up in daily

14:54.690 --> 14:57.550
matters of the self to face this aspect.

14:57.550 --> 14:59.850
- Everyone in here has
probably experienced

14:59.850 --> 15:03.050
deja vu or clairvoyancy, the
strong feeling that you've

15:03.050 --> 15:05.380
been in the same situation before

15:05.380 --> 15:08.090
or that you know exactly
what's going to happen.

15:08.090 --> 15:11.770
In Back to Brazil,
Freedinland uses foreshadowing

15:11.770 --> 15:13.700
and repetition to recreate
these feelings in the reader.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.200
(eerie music)

15:19.800 --> 15:21.970
(gasping)

15:25.850 --> 15:28.300
Let's talk about how she uses this.

15:29.500 --> 15:32.490
- [Student] Well, uh, isn't
Freedinland trying to, uh.

15:35.660 --> 15:38.160
- He didn't even touch the
most interesting stuff.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.330
You'll like this.

15:41.330 --> 15:44.580
Some studies show the brain
waves can be transmitted

15:44.580 --> 15:47.050
and received like light and sound waves.

15:47.050 --> 15:47.880
- Really?

15:47.880 --> 15:48.890
The actual brain waves?

15:48.890 --> 15:51.140
- Yeah, they did this
really neat experiment

15:51.140 --> 15:53.280
where they took a mother
cat and separated her

15:53.280 --> 15:55.450
from her kittens by hundreds of miles.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.550
Then when they killed the kittens--

15:58.550 --> 15:59.690
- They killed the kittens?

15:59.690 --> 16:01.840
- The mother cat cried at the exact

16:01.840 --> 16:03.930
moment that each kitten died.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.280
She knew what was happening by brain wave.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.630
Now admit it, that's amazing.

16:08.630 --> 16:10.000
- Forget amazing.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.020
It's cruel, that's really horrible Andy.

16:13.020 --> 16:14.300
- It's okay, Sara.

16:14.300 --> 16:17.660
- It is not, talk about
reptilian behavior.

16:23.980 --> 16:26.160
- Ready to do a little mind reading?

16:26.160 --> 16:28.070
- You sure you wanna know
what this guy's thinkin'?

16:29.040 --> 16:29.870
- Okay.

16:31.050 --> 16:34.050
Let's find out what's bothering you.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.130
- One down, three to go.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.790
- Oh, well thank you very much.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.990
You could be over here helping us.

16:41.990 --> 16:44.490
- Come on everybody, let's go!

16:46.650 --> 16:47.630
- Somebody's tennis racket.

16:47.630 --> 16:48.960
- Okay hurry up.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.740
- Goodbye, Mrs. Lawrence,
have a nice weekend.

17:13.740 --> 17:16.180
- Oh thanks honey, you
girls have a good time too.

17:16.180 --> 17:18.530
Oh, remember to keep the doors locked,

17:18.530 --> 17:22.160
and remind Linda, she always forgets.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.780
There's a spare key in the
basement if you need one

17:24.780 --> 17:27.599
and I left my hotel number on the fridge.

17:27.599 --> 17:28.430
- Okay.

17:42.890 --> 17:43.720
- Was it something that--

17:43.720 --> 17:44.920
- Hold it, something's wrong,

17:44.920 --> 17:47.240
I'm getting a high
incidence of theta waves.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.520
- No he frequently reads theta.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.860
- What do you mean, he walks around

17:50.860 --> 17:53.220
half asleep half awake all the time?

17:53.220 --> 17:54.420
- Now you know why I'm so interested

17:54.420 --> 17:55.820
in what happened last night.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.800
Was it something here at the hospital?

18:03.470 --> 18:04.650
Something you dreamt?

18:07.040 --> 18:09.320
Was it a person in your dream?

18:12.400 --> 18:13.430
Someone you know?

18:15.130 --> 18:15.960
- Laura.

18:22.190 --> 18:23.330
- Since when is he verbal?

18:23.330 --> 18:25.530
- Since this minute.

18:25.530 --> 18:28.450
(foreboding music)

18:58.970 --> 19:00.130
- Who are you?

19:01.810 --> 19:03.800
(screaming)

19:03.800 --> 19:06.630
- Give me another five milligrams.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.440
(screaming)

19:11.440 --> 19:12.520
- What is it?

19:14.120 --> 19:16.000
- I didn't expect you.

19:17.420 --> 19:18.250
- Obviously not.

19:20.110 --> 19:21.720
I left my directions.

19:32.270 --> 19:34.350
Beth, honey, try to relax.

19:34.350 --> 19:35.180
- Yes, sorry.

19:45.990 --> 19:48.190
- Well I guess that's all for today.

19:48.190 --> 19:50.630
- Maybe a couple of days.

19:50.630 --> 19:53.130
(eerie music)

20:00.970 --> 20:03.880
(doorbell ringing)

20:10.840 --> 20:12.240
- Hey we forgot our keys.

20:13.530 --> 20:17.590
Alright, the whole place to ourselves.

20:17.590 --> 20:20.230
Let's eat Melanie's ice cream.

20:20.230 --> 20:23.180
- Oh god, do you know what
I've always wanted to do?

20:23.180 --> 20:26.800
I mean like if time stopped
for everyone except me?

20:26.800 --> 20:30.040
Try on Cindy's clothes.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.070
- Yes!

20:33.920 --> 20:36.440
- Come on, Beth, this
is a once in a lifetime.

20:39.900 --> 20:43.790
(upbeat jazzy music)

20:43.790 --> 20:46.040
- Alright, pink's my color.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.430
- And the purple one.

21:15.390 --> 21:18.140
(girls laughing)

21:30.760 --> 21:32.090
- We got robbed.

22:00.730 --> 22:02.910
- God, how can she afford all these?

22:02.910 --> 22:04.370
I mean I'm into excess as much as

22:04.370 --> 22:06.510
the next person, but come on.

22:06.510 --> 22:08.110
- Tracy, her allowance is more

22:08.110 --> 22:09.950
than my parents' combined income.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.590
What's the matter, Beth?

22:13.590 --> 22:14.640
Too old for dress up?

22:18.000 --> 22:19.020
Are you okay?

22:20.400 --> 22:22.270
- I'm sorry I'm so out of it,

22:22.270 --> 22:25.410
I just can't get this
dream out of my head.

22:25.410 --> 22:28.550
- Well I know a lot about
dreams, tell me about it.

22:37.930 --> 22:40.620
(keys jangling)

22:40.620 --> 22:43.540
(foreboding music)

23:04.950 --> 23:07.030
- And everywhere I looked, I found blood.

23:09.330 --> 23:11.790
I felt like there was somebody there,

23:11.790 --> 23:12.990
only I couldn't see him.

23:15.870 --> 23:18.570
And then all of the sudden
he started attacking me.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.580
- Whoa.

23:21.580 --> 23:23.000
- Beth, that's creepy.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.310
- I know, it's really scary.

23:25.310 --> 23:26.830
- Okay, the first thing to realize

23:26.830 --> 23:30.570
is it is just a dream, it's
nothing to be afraid of.

23:30.570 --> 23:33.680
Dreams are only your subconscious'
way of talking to you.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.240
- Uh, Beth, if your subconscious

23:35.240 --> 23:36.790
asks for me, I'm not here okay?

23:38.290 --> 23:41.680
- You know I have a book
that explains dream symbols,

23:41.680 --> 23:43.900
I'll get it and we'll crack this baby.

23:45.560 --> 23:50.250
Oh shit, Cindy's gonna kill me.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.600
(suspenseful music)

24:27.150 --> 24:28.070
- What'll it be?

24:29.600 --> 24:31.010
- What goes with analysis?

24:31.010 --> 24:35.730
- Gin, very introspective,
martinis for your New York 40's,

24:35.730 --> 24:39.690
tonics for the unions among
us, tap for the behavioralists.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.640
- Make mine gin tonic.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.550
- Martini over here.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.140
- Better give me one of each.

24:48.190 --> 24:51.190
(suspenseful music)

25:02.240 --> 25:04.170
(glass shattering)

25:04.170 --> 25:06.750
- Hey what are you doing there?

25:21.130 --> 25:26.130
- Okay, dolls, frequently
represent childhood.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.120
Well that was easy.

25:29.120 --> 25:32.250
- Dolls equal childhood,
for this you need your book?

25:32.250 --> 25:34.400
- Wait, Beth said they seemed alive,

25:34.400 --> 25:36.100
living dolls, that's us right?

25:36.100 --> 25:37.860
- Hey I would appreciate it if you people

25:37.860 --> 25:40.480
would stop trampling all over my major.

25:40.480 --> 25:43.310
Dream imagery is a really personal thing,

25:43.310 --> 25:45.560
you can't figure it out
with books like that.

25:47.700 --> 25:50.160
- Now the fancy table setup.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.280
- I bet that's the party.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.050
- I'll go for that, this says

25:54.050 --> 25:56.420
it's family or social situations.

25:56.420 --> 25:58.450
- But that can't be right.

25:58.450 --> 26:00.480
I'm not terrified of planning a party.

26:01.950 --> 26:04.870
What does a guy with a knife mean?

26:04.870 --> 26:06.400
- Means you're weird, girl.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.840
- Look, the guy probably
represents the opposite sex.

26:09.840 --> 26:13.460
There's nothing specific you
recognize about him right?

26:13.460 --> 26:14.810
- Right.

26:14.810 --> 26:16.500
- And the knife's obviously fear,

26:17.740 --> 26:20.330
which would tie in with
the bloody catcher's mitt.

26:20.330 --> 26:23.550
Fright associated with a male object.

26:24.630 --> 26:29.580
- Male object is right, the
knife is a phallic symbol.

26:31.060 --> 26:34.180
- Uh oh Beth, spilled
your innermost beans here.

26:34.180 --> 26:35.860
Scared of sex?

26:37.960 --> 26:39.200
- Not that I know of.

26:40.850 --> 26:42.360
What do marbles mean?

26:43.710 --> 26:46.780
- It means that you're losing yours.

26:46.780 --> 26:49.700
(car horn honking)

26:54.770 --> 26:56.800
Alright, Tracy rented some men.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.460
- Hey where do you want this stuff?

26:58.460 --> 27:00.080
- In the back.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.510
- I told you I'd taken care of things.

27:03.460 --> 27:05.960
(eerie music)

27:17.570 --> 27:19.820
- Hey, that's my car, stop.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.890
- I don't think Mrs. Lawrence is gonna

27:36.890 --> 27:39.540
be too keen on all this junk, Tracy.

27:43.530 --> 27:45.960
- But it'll be fun, I am sick and tired

27:45.960 --> 27:48.190
of the same old circle of chairs.

27:48.190 --> 27:50.320
It's time to put some wow in the pow-wow.

27:53.030 --> 27:55.950
(unsettling music)

28:28.240 --> 28:30.580
(screaming)

28:39.460 --> 28:40.300
- Hi.

28:40.300 --> 28:41.130
- Hey.

28:41.130 --> 28:42.120
- What are you guys doing here?

28:42.120 --> 28:44.530
- Oh you know us, always up
for a little teepee party.

28:44.530 --> 28:46.110
- Fine, then we'll put you to work.

28:46.110 --> 28:47.980
- Whoa what is all this stuff?

28:47.980 --> 28:51.330
- Oh, Tracy went theme happy,
must be all that firewater.

29:15.150 --> 29:17.370
- Craig and I will go
inside and hold it steady.

29:17.370 --> 29:18.200
- Right.

29:37.450 --> 29:40.100
(clapping)

29:40.100 --> 29:43.520
- Funny guys, you're a
regular laugh and a half.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.880
- Come on you guys,
let's finish this later.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.600
- Yeah I gotta take off.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.840
- But you're gonna stay right?

29:48.840 --> 29:51.550
- Sure, I gotta work later tonight.

29:51.550 --> 29:53.620
- You could stay here this weekend, Steve.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.340
- Yeah but I wanna go rafting.

29:59.810 --> 30:02.180
- A slug, a major slug.

30:02.180 --> 30:03.340
- I'll see you next weekend.

30:03.340 --> 30:05.200
- Maybe, maybe not.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.010
- Attention, we have a
missing and dangerous patient.

30:11.010 --> 30:14.290
Ward personnel, locate and
subdue patient Robert Henkel,

30:14.290 --> 30:16.640
I repeat we are missing patient Henkel.

30:23.450 --> 30:25.580
- Great, just great.

30:35.170 --> 30:36.580
- Fix the lights, guys.

30:36.580 --> 30:37.760
- [Craig] What are you talkin' about?

30:37.760 --> 30:42.020
- You know, lights,
fusebox, immature goofballs.

30:42.020 --> 30:43.430
- We didn't do anything.

30:43.430 --> 30:44.260
- Honest.

30:45.850 --> 30:49.060
- Okay, if you're that desperate
to have us in the dark.

30:51.860 --> 30:54.520
(evil laughing)

31:02.390 --> 31:03.220
- This is it.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.080
- And he's still missing?

31:05.080 --> 31:07.920
- If you ask me, he's
not missing, he's gone.

31:07.920 --> 31:09.590
You know, over the fence.

31:10.430 --> 31:11.320
- Description.

31:12.250 --> 31:17.250
- I'd say he's six foot,
190 pounds, blue eyes,

31:17.660 --> 31:19.900
real pale fucker, mean as hell right now.

31:19.900 --> 31:21.580
- What's the background on him?

31:21.580 --> 31:24.130
- Don't have it, have to
call the doctor in charge.

31:25.390 --> 31:28.530
- Wait a minute, are you
saying this is a haunted house?

31:28.530 --> 31:32.920
- Well think about it, I mean
what makes a house haunted?

31:34.100 --> 31:35.600
It's when a bad thing happens,

31:37.310 --> 31:39.750
and you can't do much
worse than this guy did.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.230
- I read somewhere that ghosts are just

31:43.230 --> 31:46.480
people's psychic energy
that stays in a place.

31:51.070 --> 31:54.760
- Uh oh, somewhere someone's
killing kittens, I can feel it.

31:54.760 --> 31:55.590
- Andy!

31:57.480 --> 32:00.080
- So what exactly did this guy do?

32:00.080 --> 32:03.080
(suspenseful music)

32:09.280 --> 32:12.730
- And then he took a
pick axe and he crept up

32:12.730 --> 32:17.730
on his mom and dad as they
watched TV in this very room.

32:23.330 --> 32:24.170
And bam!

32:26.400 --> 32:28.070
He let them have it.

32:32.340 --> 32:34.350
Then he took his father's hunting knife

32:38.240 --> 32:39.790
and he went hunting.

32:39.790 --> 32:41.160
- No, don't.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.000
- [Tracy] Yeah John, that's enough.

32:43.000 --> 32:43.900
- [John] You okay?

32:44.940 --> 32:45.770
- It's horrible.

32:45.770 --> 32:47.370
- Well yeah, that's the point.

32:48.670 --> 32:51.340
- Go on, John, I like being spooked.

32:52.540 --> 32:55.050
- I'll stop if it's really scaring you.

32:55.050 --> 32:56.900
- No it's okay, you guys go on.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.300
I'm not feeling so great,
I'm gonna go upstairs.

33:04.670 --> 33:06.150
- Okay, then what?

33:07.730 --> 33:10.380
- Then he went to where his
little sisters lay asleep

33:11.670 --> 33:16.640
and one by one, room by room
he murdered his entire family.

33:20.450 --> 33:21.800
- That's one solution.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.860
- Jeez, when was this?

33:23.860 --> 33:26.130
- How long has this been the theta house?

33:26.130 --> 33:27.500
- About 12 years.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.540
- Then it was 13 or 14 years ago.

33:31.930 --> 33:34.550
They were the last family
to live and die here

33:34.550 --> 33:36.440
before the sorority bought the place.

33:36.440 --> 33:37.650
- Right.

33:37.650 --> 33:39.190
- Look, it happens to be true.

33:39.190 --> 33:40.530
- Nice try, John, but I've heard

33:40.530 --> 33:42.230
that about every house on the row.

33:43.170 --> 33:45.650
Come on, let's catch some tube.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.590
(ominous music)

33:56.440 --> 33:59.350
(light switch flicking)

33:59.350 --> 34:00.850
- Oh, thanks guys.

34:20.750 --> 34:23.040
Jesus John, what are you doing?

34:23.040 --> 34:25.760
- I just wanted to make
sure that you were alright.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.449
- Well I will be if you
stop scaring me to death.

34:28.449 --> 34:30.460
- I'm sorry, I mean I couldn't see you.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.600
- Look, I think I'm gonna call it a night.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.280
- You sure?

34:42.310 --> 34:44.060
What room are you in?

34:44.060 --> 34:47.400
- Well I was in that one, but
I'm not sleeping there again.

34:49.909 --> 34:51.940
- Well, goodnight.

34:53.989 --> 34:54.820
- Goodnight.

34:56.940 --> 34:57.850
Some date, huh?

35:00.300 --> 35:02.100
I'm sorry I wasn't much fun tonight.

35:03.610 --> 35:04.910
- It's okay with me, Beth.

35:06.770 --> 35:08.570
I mean I just like being around you.

35:24.870 --> 35:26.620
- You son of a bitch.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.760
- Oh so the scaremeister
himself gets the willies?

35:31.760 --> 35:33.180
- Don't be a jerk, Andy.

35:33.180 --> 35:34.830
- Oh come on, I was just kidding.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.890
Man fuck you if you can't take a joke.

35:37.890 --> 35:40.230
- Let us lighten up, shall we?

35:40.230 --> 35:41.990
I mean we're here to have fun, right?

35:41.990 --> 35:43.900
- Hey you guys, catch this.

35:52.790 --> 35:54.780
- I don't know, she should be home by now.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.050
Oh wait, hold on.

35:56.050 --> 35:57.690
- [Dr. Lindsey] This is Dr. Karen Lindsey,

35:57.690 --> 36:00.540
please leave your message
after the tone, thanks.

36:00.540 --> 36:01.580
(answering machine beeping)

36:01.580 --> 36:03.890
- Dr. Lindsey, this is
Larry over at the hospital.

36:03.890 --> 36:05.950
Please call in as soon as you get this.

36:05.950 --> 36:07.250
Robert Henkel has escaped.

36:10.170 --> 36:11.700
- Don't your doctors have beepers?

36:11.700 --> 36:12.530
- Here?

36:12.530 --> 36:13.530
You gotta be kidding.

36:14.690 --> 36:17.520
(ominous music)

36:17.520 --> 36:18.680
- [Man] Laura?

36:22.810 --> 36:23.640
- John?

36:48.710 --> 36:51.040
(screaming)

37:06.290 --> 37:08.340
- Same kind of dream?

37:08.340 --> 37:10.200
- The same dream.

37:10.200 --> 37:13.920
I mean, more of the same dream.

37:13.920 --> 37:17.720
- Uh, Beth, do you always
have nightmares like this?

37:17.720 --> 37:20.340
Cause one thing about
being in a sorority is,

37:20.340 --> 37:22.540
you know, other people have to sleep.

37:22.540 --> 37:26.580
- I don't get it, I've
never had bad dreams.

37:26.580 --> 37:30.300
Something really awful must
be going on inside my head.

37:30.300 --> 37:33.080
- Maybe it's being in
all these strange rooms.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.980
You should stay with Sara and me tonight.

37:35.980 --> 37:39.790
- Thanks, but I don't feel
much like sleep right now.

37:41.110 --> 37:44.440
- And can we please do something
about the lights, Craig?

37:44.440 --> 37:45.840
- What do you mean?

37:45.840 --> 37:48.540
- Oh I'll do it, god
Craig enough's enough.

38:13.380 --> 38:16.300
(foreboding music)

38:23.050 --> 38:25.890
(switch clacking)

38:28.300 --> 38:29.170
Craig!

38:31.110 --> 38:33.580
Shit, what a creepy thing to do.

38:33.580 --> 38:35.840
- I'm sorry.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.090
Boy am I sorry.

38:38.250 --> 38:41.100
- Well I wouldn't have done
that if I'd known it was you.

38:43.300 --> 38:46.290
- I just wanted to tell you
my great idea for tonight.

38:46.290 --> 38:47.530
- What?

38:47.530 --> 38:49.650
- Let's spend the night in the teepee.

38:49.650 --> 38:50.810
Remember the teepee?

38:52.100 --> 38:55.770
- Okay, but it's not up.

38:55.770 --> 38:57.570
- Don't worry baby, I can get it up.

38:58.930 --> 38:59.760
- Craig!

39:00.760 --> 39:03.680
(unsettling music)

39:29.030 --> 39:30.790
- So what's this dream all about?

39:30.790 --> 39:32.100
- Oh we should warn you John,

39:32.100 --> 39:34.110
Beth has this morbid fear of sex.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.290
- Tracy.

39:35.290 --> 39:36.680
- I tell you guys I really think

39:36.680 --> 39:38.910
this dream means something serious.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.210
- What happened this time?

39:41.440 --> 39:43.120
- He killed somebody else.

39:43.120 --> 39:43.950
- [John] What?

39:45.500 --> 39:50.500
- It's so strange, in my
dream I'm in this house

39:50.970 --> 39:52.620
except everything's different.

39:54.750 --> 39:57.460
Then there's that guy,
only this time I felt

39:58.630 --> 40:01.280
like I knew him, so I wasn't afraid.

40:04.710 --> 40:06.720
And then he started killing someone

40:09.010 --> 40:12.690
and all of a sudden I knew I was next.

40:15.170 --> 40:18.610
Oh god, I'm awake now, I know I'm awake

40:18.610 --> 40:21.430
but I still feel like he's coming for me.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.120
- It's okay, Beth, we're all here.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.600
Nothing's gonna happen.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.430
- But something's already happened.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.570
It's like he's already here.

40:40.810 --> 40:42.840
When John was telling his story,

40:42.840 --> 40:44.620
I looked over the--

40:44.620 --> 40:47.370
(sinister music)

40:50.190 --> 40:51.020
He's hiding it.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.120
- Who's hiding what?

40:56.110 --> 40:59.000
- The knife, he put it in the fireplace.

41:00.540 --> 41:01.740
- I hope he wore gloves.

41:04.230 --> 41:05.180
- It's still there.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.550
- Oh please, and where
did he bury the gold?

41:09.550 --> 41:11.320
- Let's check it out.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.400
- Come on Craig, you
don't believe this shit.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.900
(eerie music)

41:30.700 --> 41:33.470
Oh yeah, now this is fun.

41:33.470 --> 41:34.300
- It's that one.

41:44.470 --> 41:45.880
- [Sara] Alright.

41:50.800 --> 41:51.720
- Ah ah ah!

41:59.610 --> 42:01.410
- Why's it dirty?

42:01.410 --> 42:03.080
- That's blood.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.610
- Or dirt.

42:04.610 --> 42:08.060
- Beth's right, that's dried blood.

42:08.060 --> 42:08.890
- Oh yuck.

42:09.850 --> 42:12.070
- Beth, do you know what this means?

42:12.070 --> 42:13.890
- I know what it means, it means

42:13.890 --> 42:16.270
you guys put on one hell of a show.

42:16.270 --> 42:18.830
Maybe we should try it on
the whole house on Halloween.

42:18.830 --> 42:20.220
- We didn't plan this.

42:20.220 --> 42:21.680
- Uh huh, right.

42:21.680 --> 42:24.980
- Well I think Beth's psychic,
and I think it's neat.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.060
Maybe we are the haunted
sorority house after all.

42:32.060 --> 42:33.410
- No way, Sara.

42:35.100 --> 42:36.180
- What are you doing?

42:36.180 --> 42:37.990
- Oh come on, it hardly belongs

42:37.990 --> 42:39.440
on the mantle of achievement.

42:45.860 --> 42:48.910
(answering machine rewinding)

42:48.910 --> 42:51.320
- [Larry] Dr. Lindsey, this
is Larry over at the hospital.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.410
Please call in as soon as you get this,

42:53.410 --> 42:55.120
Robert Henkel has escaped.

43:05.970 --> 43:07.080
Okay I have his file.

43:07.080 --> 43:07.910
- [Dr. Lindsey] There should be an address

43:07.910 --> 43:10.310
for his aunt, a Mrs. Jarvis I think.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.310
- Sweet jesus.

43:16.310 --> 43:17.140
- [Dr. Lindsey] The first picture?

43:17.140 --> 43:18.240
- Yeah.

43:18.240 --> 43:19.610
- That's when I picked him up.

43:19.610 --> 43:21.180
The police should know his history.

43:21.180 --> 43:22.360
- What did he do?

43:22.360 --> 43:24.760
- Murdered five members of his family,

43:24.760 --> 43:26.130
only one little girl survived.

43:26.130 --> 43:29.250
She lives with the aunt,
he may be headed there.

43:29.250 --> 43:30.880
- His scars.

43:30.880 --> 43:32.210
- I think he heard something terrible,

43:32.210 --> 43:34.430
something he felt he couldn't silence

43:34.430 --> 43:37.070
any other way, not even by killing.

43:37.070 --> 43:39.070
- This guy is really sick.

43:39.070 --> 43:41.510
- [Dr. Lindsey] You share
the court's opinion.

43:41.510 --> 43:42.660
- Found the address.

43:42.660 --> 43:44.210
I'll get this to Detective Gilbert.

43:44.210 --> 43:45.280
- Tell him to get over there right away,

43:45.280 --> 43:47.080
this girl's in real danger.

43:47.080 --> 43:48.320
- Gotcha.

43:48.320 --> 43:49.980
- Beth, there's something we could try

43:49.980 --> 43:52.620
to figure out what's bothering you.

43:52.620 --> 43:53.450
- What?

43:53.450 --> 43:54.720
- Hypnosis.

43:54.720 --> 43:55.880
- [Tracy] Ooh.

43:55.880 --> 43:58.260
- There's nothing ooh about it, Tracy.

43:59.510 --> 44:01.110
It's common practice for getting at

44:01.110 --> 44:02.700
hidden or repressed feelings.

44:03.980 --> 44:06.340
I've done it before,
I know what I'm doing.

44:07.940 --> 44:09.350
- Alright, let's try it.

44:09.350 --> 44:11.980
- Okay look up at the ceiling.

44:13.300 --> 44:15.820
Now pick a spot and concentrate on it.

44:17.880 --> 44:22.880
Now breathe deep and relax,
let your whole body relax.

44:25.350 --> 44:27.040
That's not how it's done.

44:28.570 --> 44:30.600
- Holy shit am I gonna get it.

44:39.570 --> 44:41.410
- You really have to go?

44:41.410 --> 44:44.130
- I really really have to go.

44:44.130 --> 44:45.820
- I wish you could stay.

44:45.820 --> 44:49.670
- Me too, but hey, people
need their cookies.

44:50.630 --> 44:52.310
- Call me first thing tomorrow?

44:52.310 --> 44:53.150
- I will.

45:00.380 --> 45:03.540
(eerie music)

45:03.540 --> 45:04.370
Hey who are you?

45:05.250 --> 45:06.110
What's the plan here buddy?

45:06.110 --> 45:08.690
You gotta get a freezer to be--

45:33.440 --> 45:34.340
- Can you hear me?

45:36.170 --> 45:37.000
- Yes.

45:40.150 --> 45:43.630
- Okay, you're back in your dream now.

45:43.630 --> 45:44.460
- No.

45:44.460 --> 45:45.670
- What is it?

45:45.670 --> 45:46.590
- I don't wanna be here.

45:46.590 --> 45:48.860
- Okay, stay calm you're alright.

45:48.860 --> 45:51.020
Let's go further back,

45:51.020 --> 45:53.040
back to the place the dream comes from.

45:55.810 --> 45:57.720
Okay, where are you?

45:59.060 --> 46:01.120
- In the house.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.320
- [Linda] In this house?

46:04.040 --> 46:04.920
- My house.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.510
- [Linda] What's happening?

46:10.530 --> 46:12.720
- Bobby's hurting everyone.

46:12.720 --> 46:13.560
- Who's Bobby?

46:14.730 --> 46:16.260
- My brother.

46:16.260 --> 46:17.810
- [Linda] Is Bobby hurting you?

46:18.730 --> 46:20.990
- No, 'cause I'm in the basement.

46:22.650 --> 46:24.080
But he wants to hurt me.

46:25.280 --> 46:26.490
- [Linda] Why?

46:26.490 --> 46:28.390
- I don't know.

46:28.390 --> 46:29.760
- Beth, how old are you?

46:32.450 --> 46:33.280
Beth?

46:34.490 --> 46:37.040
- I'm five, but I'm--

46:39.560 --> 46:41.010
- Laura?

46:41.010 --> 46:43.090
- [Beth] No, he's coming.

46:44.580 --> 46:45.410
He knows where I am.

46:45.410 --> 46:47.580
- Hey, it's alright, when you wake up

46:47.580 --> 46:49.350
you'll be safe here with us,

46:49.350 --> 46:51.550
and you'll wake up on the count of three.

46:51.550 --> 46:52.830
One two three.

46:57.080 --> 46:58.180
- [Beth] Please hurry.

46:59.700 --> 47:00.530
- [Linda] Beth!

47:00.530 --> 47:01.420
- Please help me.

47:01.420 --> 47:02.670
- [Linda] One two three.

47:02.670 --> 47:03.830
- [Beth] Please help me.

47:03.830 --> 47:06.310
- One two three.

47:06.310 --> 47:07.670
One two three!

47:07.670 --> 47:08.870
Beth, you're awake.

47:08.870 --> 47:11.200
(screaming)

47:12.990 --> 47:14.500
- Oh god.

47:14.500 --> 47:17.000
What is it, am I crazy?

47:17.870 --> 47:19.370
- You're okay now.

47:20.250 --> 47:21.500
- What happened?

47:21.500 --> 47:23.470
- It was pretty strange,

47:23.470 --> 47:25.410
but it could mean a couple of things.

47:25.410 --> 47:27.550
- Easy, Beth, I think you're obsessed

47:27.550 --> 47:29.620
with that stupid ghost story.

47:29.620 --> 47:30.990
- Or maybe there was some trauma

47:30.990 --> 47:33.060
back when you were little
that's coming up now.

47:33.060 --> 47:33.890
- But why now?

47:33.890 --> 47:36.610
Why did it start when I came here?

47:36.610 --> 47:38.860
- What happened when
you were five years old?

47:43.600 --> 47:45.400
- I don't remember anything.

47:45.400 --> 47:46.230
- Nothing?

47:47.270 --> 47:49.920
- Well, what do you remember
from when you were five?

47:53.030 --> 47:54.130
- I see what you mean.

47:55.620 --> 47:57.140
- I remember lime jello.

48:01.400 --> 48:02.560
You know what I think?

48:03.710 --> 48:07.410
I think you just had a
past life experience.

48:07.410 --> 48:09.390
I think you're remembering something

48:09.390 --> 48:12.140
that happened before you were you.

48:13.970 --> 48:16.630
- Sorry Sara, I don't
believe in that stuff.

48:17.490 --> 48:18.800
- Neither do I.

48:18.800 --> 48:21.670
- Well whatever it is,
it's too weird for words.

48:21.670 --> 48:22.500
- Psst.

48:24.820 --> 48:27.900
- I gotta go, goodnight all.

48:27.900 --> 48:29.150
- For some of us.

48:29.150 --> 48:31.790
- Yeah, I guess the bachelorette's club

48:31.790 --> 48:33.920
reconvenes in our room.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.850
- Yeah I am pretty zonked.

48:35.850 --> 48:37.130
- Coming soon, Beth?

48:37.130 --> 48:39.620
- I wouldn't count on it.

48:39.620 --> 48:42.620
(suspenseful music)

49:20.090 --> 49:22.890
- Do you think this
place could be haunted?

49:22.890 --> 49:24.140
- I think you're haunted.

49:26.140 --> 49:26.970
- Maybe I am.

49:48.510 --> 49:49.530
- What's the matter?

49:49.530 --> 49:50.360
- Shh.

49:51.580 --> 49:53.000
- Hear something?

49:54.400 --> 49:55.570
- I guess not.

50:09.270 --> 50:11.610
(screaming)

50:20.120 --> 50:22.780
(cloth ripping)

50:27.200 --> 50:28.870
- Did you hear that?

50:30.380 --> 50:33.120
- What, the TV?

50:33.120 --> 50:36.270
- It sounded like shrieking outside.

50:38.230 --> 50:40.920
- Probably just Tracy's
reaction to Craig's tomahawk.

50:43.770 --> 50:46.100
(shrieking)

50:54.640 --> 50:55.480
- Oh god.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.090
Oh god, Craig.

51:13.260 --> 51:14.680
- Susan.

51:14.680 --> 51:15.510
- Tracy?

51:22.700 --> 51:23.620
John, Sara!

51:32.790 --> 51:35.480
- God Craig, you're bleeding.

51:35.480 --> 51:37.280
- What is it?

51:37.280 --> 51:38.950
- Some guy just killed Tracy.

51:38.950 --> 51:39.780
- What?

51:41.830 --> 51:42.730
- He cut the line.

51:44.050 --> 51:45.460
- You'd better not be joking.

51:45.460 --> 51:48.260
- This is for real you
guys, I swear it's for real.

51:48.260 --> 51:50.430
We gotta get through to the police.

51:50.430 --> 51:52.380
- Cindy's room, she's got her own line.

52:00.870 --> 52:03.460
Come on, come on.

52:05.930 --> 52:06.760
It's ringing.

52:09.100 --> 52:10.080
It stopped.

52:11.110 --> 52:11.940
- He cut it.

52:11.940 --> 52:13.610
- Craig, what the hell is going on?

52:13.610 --> 52:14.440
Who is it?

52:15.670 --> 52:18.660
- I don't know, but I
think he's after all of us.

52:20.480 --> 52:23.400
(foreboding music)

52:51.630 --> 52:54.550
(whispered sounds)

54:23.940 --> 54:25.270
- [Bobby] Laura.

54:43.060 --> 54:44.300
Laura.

54:44.300 --> 54:45.250
- Sara!

54:45.250 --> 54:46.090
- John!

54:53.930 --> 54:55.540
- They would have heard us.

54:56.490 --> 54:57.420
- He got them.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.550
- No!

55:17.090 --> 55:18.260
- Linda, Sara!

55:25.230 --> 55:26.600
Call the police.

55:26.600 --> 55:27.520
- We can't.

55:29.610 --> 55:31.470
- That guy just killed John.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.580
He killed John and it's my fault.

55:34.580 --> 55:36.120
- What do you mean?

55:36.120 --> 55:37.510
- He was trying to kill me.

55:37.510 --> 55:40.660
(bashing on door)

55:40.660 --> 55:41.490
- He went away.

55:42.600 --> 55:43.580
- Or he's waiting.

55:44.700 --> 55:45.630
- Help me with this.

55:45.630 --> 55:47.220
- Oh god, Craig.

55:47.220 --> 55:48.670
- I'm okay.

55:48.670 --> 55:49.810
- Where's Tracy?

55:51.100 --> 55:52.570
- Son of a bitch killed her.

55:56.440 --> 55:57.690
That should keep him out.

56:01.050 --> 56:02.100
- What if it doesn't?

56:03.380 --> 56:04.810
- We've got this.

56:04.810 --> 56:07.650
My mom sent it after that
rape on campus last year.

56:07.650 --> 56:09.730
- That's great but we've
still gotta get help.

56:09.730 --> 56:11.400
- Can't do that without leaving this room.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.180
- Maybe he'll go away.

56:15.870 --> 56:16.950
- The window.

56:25.210 --> 56:26.930
- I don't know.

56:26.930 --> 56:29.060
- Beth's right, it's the best way out.

56:29.060 --> 56:31.280
Stick together and run like hell.

56:31.280 --> 56:34.560
- It'll be kinda hard to run
if we all break our legs.

56:34.560 --> 56:36.080
- Help!

56:36.080 --> 56:36.920
Help!

56:37.910 --> 56:38.740
Help!

56:40.180 --> 56:42.000
Can't anybody hear us?

56:46.920 --> 56:48.200
(glass shattering)

56:48.200 --> 56:50.310
- They'll hear that.

56:50.310 --> 56:51.540
- If anybody's home.

56:52.990 --> 56:55.240
- Oh shit, where's my brain?

56:55.240 --> 56:56.590
We have a fire ladder.

57:00.930 --> 57:01.770
From mom.

57:11.500 --> 57:14.240
Wait, he's gone.

57:15.120 --> 57:16.580
We can go out the front.

57:22.050 --> 57:25.880
- He's still out there,
I can hear him breathing.

57:31.830 --> 57:34.580
- Wait til I get to the bottom
so I can hold it steady.

57:42.680 --> 57:43.840
Okay, come on.

57:50.810 --> 57:53.560
(heart beating)

57:53.560 --> 57:54.390
Hurry!

58:03.760 --> 58:05.680
- Craig, hold it still.

58:08.060 --> 58:08.890
Better.

58:13.260 --> 58:14.320
Oh shit.

58:14.320 --> 58:16.150
- Oh god Linda, hurry.

58:19.200 --> 58:20.040
Hurry!

58:20.040 --> 58:20.870
- No!

58:25.350 --> 58:26.190
No!

58:34.630 --> 58:35.470
No, no!

58:50.900 --> 58:53.230
(screaming)

59:30.300 --> 59:31.300
- He's dead, right?

59:32.770 --> 59:34.510
I think he's dead.

59:34.510 --> 59:35.670
- I don't think so.

59:35.670 --> 59:37.400
- Well dead or not, the
important thing is that he's

59:37.400 --> 59:40.150
down there and now we have
to get the hell out of here.

59:41.740 --> 59:44.240
(eerie music)

59:59.830 --> 01:00:02.170
(screaming)

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:04.440
- Oh no, oh Andy.

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:08.280
He's dead.

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:11.460
- Oh god he's back out front.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:28.360
- Oh god what are we gonna do?

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:35.550
(glass shattering)

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:45.440
(window breaking)

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:53.190
- That's him.

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.390
That's him, that's the guy from my dream!

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:03.500
- Kitchen, come on.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.250
(screaming)

01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:20.520
No!

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:25.960
Can't we get around him?

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.410
- He'll get one of us.

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:29.350
- There's no way out back here.

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:30.180
- Bobby.

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.980
- God he's staring at me.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.830
- Janet?

01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:47.930
- Why is he staring at me?

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:50.370
- Shh, don't freak out.

01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:53.520
- Oh god, he's after me.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.350
- Get back.

01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.130
- Janet.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.880
- Oh god you guys.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.210
- Run!

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.450
(screaming)

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:24.530
Where's the key?

01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:26.000
- Oh god.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:26.830
- Upstairs.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.930
- No, basement.

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.810
- God, what now?

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:42.520
- We gotta get out of this house.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.350
(police sirens approaching)

01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:44.800
- Wait, do you hear that?

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.650
It's the police.

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:49.080
- They're not coming here,
how could they know about us?

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.800
- Somebody must have heard us yelling.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.380
- I don't think so.

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.590
(footsteps approaching)

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.130
We can't count on anybody coming for us.

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.180
We're dead.

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.010
- No!

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.060
- That's why he's here,
you know, to kill us.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.270
- But why?

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.340
- Because John's story was true

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.980
and this is the guy, he's doing it again.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.210
That's why he was saying all those names.

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:25.940
- But we're not his family,
we're not his sisters.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.910
- I think I am.

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:31.740
- What?

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:34.390
- He called me Laura.

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:36.220
- But your name's Beth.

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:40.750
- My middle name is Beth,
my first name is Laura.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:43.440
- Oh god.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.260
- I think I lived here.

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.370
I think he tried to kill me before.

01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:59.320
- And how could he know
that you'd be here?

01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:02.830
- The same way I knew he was coming.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:08.100
There's something connecting
him to what happened here.

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:12.510
There is something connecting him to me.

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:14.500
(phone ringing)

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.330
- Hello?

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:17.570
- Dr. Lindsey, Detective Gilbert.

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:20.210
About that Jarvis address, the LAPD say

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:23.290
no sign of Robert Henkel
or anyone else there.

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:24.780
Any other ideas where he might go?

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.660
- No, he wouldn't know
where else she'd be.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.540
- I see, well if anything comes to mind.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.670
- Wait a minute.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:34.500
- Yes?

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.120
- He wouldn't know the
girl lived with her aunt.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.270
He'd go to the old house,

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:41.320
the house where he committed the murders.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.850
- What did you do?

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:48.350
- I went in there.

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.530
I guess I was a lot smaller.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.420
- We're stuck.

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.230
- Oh shit, the spare.

01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:02.310
Mrs. Lawrence said there
was a spare key in here.

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:12.950
(suspenseful music)

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.680
- Now look, we are gonna go up there

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.030
through the front door
no matter what happens.

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.360
But we're gonna need weapons.

01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:27.970
We'd better be prepared to fight.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.890
I wouldn't mind giving that
creep a whack with this.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.600
(screaming)

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:51.240
- Oh god, we can't hold him.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.340
Are you ready to run?

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.170
- Ready.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.480
Wait, wait!

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.860
- He's aiming at us.

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:02.690
- Wait.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:07.560
Okay, now!

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:21.520
- Focus on the lock.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.150
- Cathy, no!

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:44.570
- [Linda] Get him!

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:14.780
- Linda?

01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:26.640
(screaming)

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.960
- The hoe, get the hoe.

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:10.460
He's dead.

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:17.960
- Oh god.

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:21.609
You saved my life.

01:08:22.569 --> 01:08:25.029
- Let's just get out
of here, come with me.

01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:37.729
- Oh god, oh jesus.

01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:54.330
I'll get to a phone.

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:56.250
- Not coming, too late.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.740
- Please, please don't move, I'll go.

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:03.899
Listen.

01:09:03.899 --> 01:09:06.979
(sirens approaching)

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:14.569
- Oh no.

01:09:14.569 --> 01:09:18.069
- They're coming, hold on they are coming.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.390
Linda?

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.930
Please god no, Linda?

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.590
- Laura.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.630
- I'm not Laura anymore,
you son of a bitch.

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:22.910
(police radio squawking)

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:29.330
- I'll radio homicide.

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:31.580
- Help me over here,
this girl's still alive.

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:51.270
- How do they look?

01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:52.800
- Pretty good, Beth,
in a couple of months,

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.930
you'll hardly be able to see them.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.510
- I wish my memories would fade as fast.

01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:00.110
- You still having those dreams?

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:05.350
Well be sure to tell Dr. Lyons
about that this afternoon.

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:06.180
- I will.

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.110
- And try to get some rest.

01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:21.960
- Beth.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.880
(screaming)

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.540
(ominous music)
