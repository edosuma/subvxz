00:00.115 --> 00:01.714
Previously on Warehouse 13...

00:01.725 --> 00:03.844
Hello.
Customer.

00:03.955 --> 00:05.075
I have a special

00:05.585 --> 00:06.405
order.

00:06.417 --> 00:08.037
So I just moved here

00:08.047 --> 00:09.747
why on earth would you do that?

00:09.757 --> 00:11.277
Unh. Awh.

00:12.487 --> 00:13.607
Oh....Dude.

00:14.117 --> 00:16.137
Claudia wait a minute.
I got the parts you ordered.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.967
Oh, your a wonderkin.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.377
So Claudia, it's hot in here

00:20.061 --> 00:21.181
this is me ignoring you.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.600 --> 01:35.434
Oh! Ahh!

01:35.502 --> 01:37.336
Myka!

01:46.313 --> 01:48.080
Eat shield, stabby!

01:52.219 --> 01:54.353
Oh, hey, are you okay?

01:54.421 --> 01:56.022
Yeah.
Here you go.

01:56.089 --> 01:57.290
Let me help you up.
Here we go.

01:57.357 --> 01:58.791
Okay.

01:58.859 --> 02:00.192
Where'd you learn to handle
a sword like that?

02:00.260 --> 02:01.527
Some girls play with Barbies,

02:01.595 --> 02:02.995
and others
took fencing lessons.

02:04.665 --> 02:06.332
Everybody got all their limbs?

02:06.400 --> 02:07.667
Yeah, that's a big ten
fingers and ten toes,

02:07.734 --> 02:08.934
good buddy.

02:09.002 --> 02:13.039
Behold mighty Excalibur.

02:13.106 --> 02:14.740
You snagged it.

02:14.808 --> 02:15.975
This could have been
a lot easier

02:16.043 --> 02:17.209
if we just swapped it out
for a fake.

02:17.277 --> 02:18.411
Yeah, only you, Artie,
would know

02:18.478 --> 02:20.046
it was a tacky wall decoration

02:20.113 --> 02:22.248
in some cheesy castle
in Cardiff.

02:22.316 --> 02:23.783
The rock, it worked?

02:23.850 --> 02:25.184
Yes, you were right.

02:25.252 --> 02:26.719
You know, as soon
as the blade came into contact

02:26.787 --> 02:28.954
with the rock that was laced
with the same metal, it--

02:29.022 --> 02:30.756
then the sword
went out of phase

02:30.824 --> 02:33.059
and allowed it to pass
right through solid matter.

02:33.126 --> 02:34.126
Preventing today's
pub special

02:34.194 --> 02:35.795
from being Myka meat pie.

02:35.862 --> 02:36.862
You realize
that's how King Arthur

02:36.930 --> 02:37.730
pulled the sword
from the stone.

02:37.798 --> 02:38.931
Oh, nice, Artie.

02:38.999 --> 02:40.099
You sure know how
to take the fun

02:40.167 --> 02:41.600
out of believing in legends.

02:41.668 --> 02:43.402
No, no, no, some legends
can have a bit of truth to them.

02:43.470 --> 02:46.572
So--so there was
a real Merlin the magician?

02:46.640 --> 02:48.474
Fiction.
Knights of the Round Table?

02:48.542 --> 02:49.742
Bedtime story.

02:49.810 --> 02:50.910
Holy Grail?

02:50.977 --> 02:53.112
Anyway, on your way back

02:53.180 --> 02:55.581
I want you to check something
out for me in Italy.

02:55.649 --> 02:57.883
That's not really
on our way back.

02:57.951 --> 02:59.118
Yeah, but I got a ping,
so go to Milan.

02:59.186 --> 03:00.753
Call me when you land.

03:00.821 --> 03:03.723
I've never been to Italy.

03:05.926 --> 03:07.393
So how'd she die?

03:07.461 --> 03:08.494
Old age.

03:08.562 --> 03:09.662
No identification.

03:09.730 --> 03:13.999
But we found these

03:14.067 --> 03:15.134
inside her body.

03:15.202 --> 03:16.402
Those look like--

03:16.470 --> 03:17.903
implants.

03:17.971 --> 03:19.505
The old woman had
silicone breast implants.

03:19.573 --> 03:22.074
I've never seen them
like this.

03:22.142 --> 03:23.843
You know, when they weren't
on active duty.

03:23.910 --> 03:26.078
Something else.

03:26.146 --> 03:28.614
The woman was shouting
something before she died.

03:30.484 --> 03:31.484
That's Russian.

03:31.551 --> 03:33.185
You speak Russian?

03:33.253 --> 03:35.354
Yeah, you know, some girls
played with Barbies and--

03:35.422 --> 03:37.390
got it, got it.
What'd she say?

03:37.457 --> 03:40.960
It means, uh...

03:41.027 --> 03:44.630
It means, "they stole me."

03:46.800 --> 03:49.602
I think I know
how we can I.D. her.

03:52.472 --> 03:54.940
All surgical implants
are labeled and coded

03:55.008 --> 03:56.375
by serial number,

03:56.443 --> 03:57.977
so you can track them
through the doctor

03:58.044 --> 03:59.879
and back to the patient.

03:59.946 --> 04:01.480
Why am I not surprised
that you are the expert

04:01.548 --> 04:02.681
on breast implants?

04:02.749 --> 04:04.617
Some boys
played with Barbies.

04:04.684 --> 04:05.851
Mmm.

04:05.919 --> 04:07.386
Now these implants

04:07.454 --> 04:09.121
were placed in the body of...

04:09.189 --> 04:11.123
Wait a minute.

04:11.191 --> 04:12.425
That--that can't be right.

04:12.492 --> 04:13.526
I don't get it.
Who is that?

04:13.593 --> 04:14.960
Anya Verdikov,

04:15.028 --> 04:16.161
age 19.

04:16.228 --> 04:17.163
Anya Verdikov.

04:17.230 --> 04:19.064
Wait, wait, you know her?

04:19.132 --> 04:21.233
Yes, she's a Russian model
in Milan for the fashion show.

04:21.301 --> 04:23.035
Okay, well, we need to meet
with her right away.

04:23.103 --> 04:25.404
She was reported missing
two days ago.

04:25.472 --> 04:27.406
You think?
We have seen stranger things.

04:27.474 --> 04:28.574
What are you saying?

04:28.642 --> 04:29.675
Either someone
took the implants

04:29.743 --> 04:31.343
out of Anya Verdikov

04:31.411 --> 04:33.712
and put them in the body
of this old woman.

04:33.780 --> 04:35.748
Or this woman
is the 19-year-old

04:35.816 --> 04:38.217
Anya Verdikov.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.301
Hello.

05:17.336 --> 05:19.604
Hey, welcome back.
What'd you bring me from Italy?

05:19.672 --> 05:22.206
You know it.
Hey, biscotti.

05:22.274 --> 05:23.908
What?

05:23.976 --> 05:25.243
Hey.

05:25.311 --> 05:27.178
It was a long flight.
Okay, so what else

05:27.246 --> 05:28.646
did you find out
about Anya Verdikov?

05:28.714 --> 05:30.114
Lots.
Found out that Anya

05:30.182 --> 05:31.149
was not the first--Claudia,
would you do the honors?

05:31.216 --> 05:32.483
Missing fashion models.

05:32.551 --> 05:34.085
They vanished
from different cities.

05:34.153 --> 05:36.988
From Tokyo, Berlin,
and Paris, and London.

05:37.056 --> 05:38.589
So since we knew
what to look for,

05:38.657 --> 05:40.124
it wasn't hard
to find a pattern.

05:40.192 --> 05:41.526
And after each model
disappeared,

05:41.593 --> 05:43.528
in the same city they found
the body of a Jane Doe.

05:43.595 --> 05:45.530
Elderly.
Yes. Very old Jane Doe.

05:45.597 --> 05:47.632
And it seemed like
it was natural causes,

05:47.700 --> 05:49.200
but I don't think so.

05:49.268 --> 05:51.035
Yeah, an unidentified
old Asian woman--

05:51.103 --> 05:52.937
Asian woman was found dead
two months ago in Paris.

05:53.005 --> 05:54.572
Hey, same tattoo.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.907
Same place.
Same woman.

05:55.975 --> 05:57.542
Okay, have you ever
seen an artifact

05:57.609 --> 05:59.711
that produces rapid aging
in a person?

05:59.778 --> 06:01.045
I've never seen anything
that causes this.

06:01.113 --> 06:02.447
So obviously it's not
a coincidence

06:02.514 --> 06:05.216
that all these victims
were models, right?

06:05.284 --> 06:06.784
All right,
so what's the plan?

06:06.852 --> 06:08.052
Since all these attacks

06:08.120 --> 06:09.520
happened around
the fashion industry

06:09.588 --> 06:11.122
and since this week in
full swing in Manhattan

06:11.190 --> 06:13.224
is Fashion Week,

06:13.292 --> 06:14.459
two tickets to New York.

06:14.526 --> 06:15.727
Nice.

06:15.794 --> 06:17.862
Original Ray's pizza.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.230
The original
original Ray's pizza

06:19.298 --> 06:20.131
is actually
in the Warehouse.

06:20.199 --> 06:21.799
And funny thing about that

06:21.867 --> 06:23.334
is the mob
bought the original cheese.

06:23.402 --> 06:24.736
You can't make a decent pie
without mob cheese.

06:24.803 --> 06:26.404
Artie.
Okay, so the way to stop this

06:26.472 --> 06:28.039
is to find Anya's Agent.

06:28.107 --> 06:29.607
The Agent will tell you
where's Anya has been

06:29.675 --> 06:31.909
and hopefully also
what she's been in touch with.

06:31.977 --> 06:34.645
Okay, perfect.
Yeah.

06:34.713 --> 06:36.714
Oh, hey, Artie,
what aisle is--

06:36.782 --> 06:38.049
not a chance.

06:38.117 --> 06:39.917
Forget it.

06:39.985 --> 06:41.753
Yeah, I'll run an artifact
search on the mainframe,

06:41.820 --> 06:43.688
see what might make
the beautiful people

06:43.756 --> 06:44.922
go geezer.

06:44.990 --> 06:46.257
Thank you.
That would be very help--

06:46.325 --> 06:49.160
God, stop it.

06:49.228 --> 06:51.629
Something you'd like to share
with the rest of the class,

06:51.697 --> 06:53.531
Miss Donovan?
No.

06:53.599 --> 06:54.866
No?

06:54.933 --> 06:56.601
That only makes me
a little bit more curious.

06:57.870 --> 07:01.372
Todd keeps texting me.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.874
Oh, you know, texting.

07:02.941 --> 07:04.375
It's what the kids
do these days

07:04.443 --> 07:06.244
instead of going
to dinosaur races.

07:06.311 --> 07:07.412
I know what texting is--

07:07.479 --> 07:08.646
also iTunes
and color television.

07:08.714 --> 07:10.314
What is a Todd?

07:10.382 --> 07:11.749
Todd.
You know, Todd.

07:11.817 --> 07:12.850
The guy from town,
from the hardware store.

07:14.386 --> 07:16.287
Oh, God, what is with him?
"Want to meet for coffee?"

07:16.355 --> 07:18.890
Give me my space!

07:18.957 --> 07:21.192
No, no, no,
why don't you text him back?

07:21.260 --> 07:23.728
I remember that kid.
He was...Inoffensive.

07:23.796 --> 07:25.930
Well, strike up the band.

07:25.998 --> 07:28.066
No, no, no, I mean,
you're not a girl anymore.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.334
What?
You--hmm?

07:30.402 --> 07:31.702
I just said, you know,

07:31.770 --> 07:33.137
you're a woman.

07:33.205 --> 07:36.607
No, well, you're a woman
because you're over 16.

07:36.675 --> 07:38.810
I'm just saying he's a man

07:38.877 --> 07:41.079
and men and women--
I--

07:41.146 --> 07:43.214
if you've never--

07:43.282 --> 07:44.415
oh, God.
I didn't mean to--

07:44.483 --> 07:46.117
pull up, pull up, pull up.

07:46.185 --> 07:47.485
I appreciate the advice,

07:47.553 --> 07:48.653
but can we
just get back to work?

07:59.031 --> 08:01.766
Best assignment ever.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.868
Just try not to be
12 years old, okay?

08:03.936 --> 08:05.303
There is no try.

08:05.370 --> 08:06.838
Only do or do not.

08:06.905 --> 08:08.773
Then do.
I'll try.

08:08.841 --> 08:10.208
I have a quick meeting
with Michael,

08:10.275 --> 08:11.609
and after that I'm going home.

08:11.677 --> 08:14.278
Would you ask Sutton
if we can reschedule?

08:14.346 --> 08:17.081
Oh, my--
Isabella Fuentes.

08:17.149 --> 08:19.117
Oh, oh, man.

08:19.184 --> 08:21.252
I--I love you.

08:21.320 --> 08:22.487
No, I--I love your work.

08:22.554 --> 08:26.190
The 2004 Swimsuit Issue,

08:26.258 --> 08:28.025
I mean, that was like
your <i>Sgt. Pepper's.</i>

08:28.093 --> 08:29.360
It was so--
thank you.

08:29.428 --> 08:31.562
If you'll excuse me,
I'm not feeling well.

08:31.630 --> 08:33.097
No, no, no, look, I won't take
up a whole lot of your time.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.500
I was just curious where you
stood on dating civil servants.

08:35.567 --> 08:36.801
You're scaring her.

08:39.505 --> 08:41.304
Ask anyone who's made
an enemy of me, Sutton,

08:41.373 --> 08:45.143
if they don't dearly
regret that decision.

08:45.210 --> 08:46.277
What--

08:46.345 --> 08:50.081
what, are we opening
a Walmart?

08:50.149 --> 08:53.084
Call Damian, have him send
Romana another gift basket.

08:53.152 --> 08:55.553
No food.
Miss Harris.

08:55.621 --> 08:56.921
I'm Myka Bering.
This is Pete Lattimer.

08:56.989 --> 08:57.955
We spoke on the phone

08:58.023 --> 08:59.157
regarding Anya Verdikov.

08:59.224 --> 09:02.660
Have you found her?

09:02.728 --> 09:05.596
I told her
I would take care of her.

09:05.664 --> 09:07.665
Do you have any idea
what happened?

09:07.733 --> 09:09.033
Well, we were hoping
you might know.

09:09.101 --> 09:12.336
I mean, was she acting
at all strangely?

09:12.404 --> 09:13.738
Well, was there anyone new

09:13.805 --> 09:15.907
that she might have come
into contact with?

09:15.974 --> 09:17.141
No one.

09:17.209 --> 09:18.609
She'd been staying
away from people.

09:18.677 --> 09:20.178
Why?
Just before Milan,

09:20.245 --> 09:24.715
Anya said she was coming
down with the flu.

09:24.783 --> 09:26.984
If you'll excuse me,
I'm not feeling well.

09:27.052 --> 09:30.221
It's Isabella.
Pete?

09:30.289 --> 09:32.390
Isabella.

09:32.457 --> 09:34.125
You're nothing
if not persistent.

09:34.193 --> 09:35.626
You don't look so good.

09:35.694 --> 09:37.161
Your pickup lines
are getting worse.

09:37.229 --> 09:39.030
I need you to come with me.

09:39.097 --> 09:40.698
I think you might be in danger.

09:40.766 --> 09:42.166
What are you talking--

09:42.234 --> 09:44.135
are you okay?
Isabella?

09:44.203 --> 09:45.603
I'm sorry,
I must be getting a fever.

09:45.671 --> 09:46.938
I've just gotta get out of here.

09:47.005 --> 09:48.239
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:48.307 --> 09:50.007
I'm burning...Up.

09:50.075 --> 09:51.242
Pete?

09:51.310 --> 09:52.610
Pete!

09:55.280 --> 09:56.214
Pete?

09:56.281 --> 09:59.083
Pete, what's happening?

10:03.021 --> 10:03.988
Get an ambulance.

10:08.093 --> 10:09.327
It was nothing, girls.

10:09.394 --> 10:12.096
Just some poor old woman
who took a fall.

10:12.164 --> 10:13.598
What's the matter with you?
It just happened.

10:13.665 --> 10:15.032
You know,
it was like a nightmare.

10:15.100 --> 10:17.134
I-I couldn't help,
and I--

10:17.202 --> 10:19.837
I just had to stand there
and watch, Artie.

10:19.905 --> 10:21.239
Pete, there was nothing
you could do.

10:21.306 --> 10:22.440
Now listen, get me the--

10:22.507 --> 10:23.708
I mean, look, we've seen

10:23.775 --> 10:25.476
a lot of bad juju
from these artifacts,

10:25.544 --> 10:26.677
but man, this one--

10:26.745 --> 10:28.179
get your head
back in the game.

10:28.247 --> 10:29.547
Get me a sample of her blood
right away.

10:29.615 --> 10:30.948
It could lead to whatever
artifact is causing

10:31.016 --> 10:32.083
this aging thing.

10:32.150 --> 10:33.284
Yeah.

10:36.021 --> 10:37.455
They're keeping a lid
on what happened

10:37.522 --> 10:38.756
to Isabella for us.

10:38.824 --> 10:40.258
You okay?

10:40.325 --> 10:42.460
Yeah, I will be
when we find this thing.

10:42.527 --> 10:43.694
Well, I tested
her clothes and jewelry.

10:43.762 --> 10:45.363
The artifact definitely
wasn't on her.

10:45.430 --> 10:46.631
Well, it wouldn't be.

10:46.698 --> 10:48.199
She probably got zapped
after a fashion show

10:48.267 --> 10:49.400
like Anya and the others.

10:49.468 --> 10:51.769
But why models?

10:51.837 --> 10:52.970
What's the connection,

10:53.038 --> 10:55.940
some hair dryer
that they're all using?

10:56.008 --> 10:57.441
Well, Anya said,
"they stole me."

10:57.509 --> 10:59.744
As if somebody was doing this
to them on purpose.

10:59.811 --> 11:01.145
There are hundreds of people

11:01.213 --> 11:02.380
behind the scenes
at these things.

11:02.447 --> 11:03.781
And fashion week ends
in three days,

11:03.849 --> 11:05.750
and with it goes most
of our potential suspects.

11:05.817 --> 11:07.451
All right, so we're gonna
have to get in on the down low

11:07.519 --> 11:09.453
and smoke out the bad guy

11:09.521 --> 11:11.389
or girl.

11:11.456 --> 11:12.757
That's easier said than done.

11:16.295 --> 11:17.962
What?

11:18.030 --> 11:19.297
Just having a thought.

11:19.364 --> 11:21.165
Well, is it a good thought?

11:21.233 --> 11:24.101
Well, I'm gonna say yes.
You're gonna say no.

11:24.169 --> 11:25.936
But I'm right,
you're wrong.

11:26.004 --> 11:29.707
Oh, hey, Miss Harris.

11:29.775 --> 11:31.876
Look, I think I know a way
to find the person

11:31.943 --> 11:36.213
who's doing this, okay,
but I'm gonna need your help.

11:43.955 --> 11:46.424
Hey.
So how'd we do?

why I had to be the model.

12:30.704 --> 12:31.971
Well, first of all,

12:32.039 --> 12:34.407
I don't have the legs
for a dress like that.

12:34.475 --> 12:36.042
And a model and her manager
won't stand out.

12:36.110 --> 12:38.344
Oh, please, nobody's gonna
believe that I'm a model.

Pete, I don't know
how to do this.

work with a new girl.

12:50.090 --> 12:52.225

You can't have rapport
with someone fresh off the farm.

12:54.228 --> 12:55.862
She's an
undiscovered treasure.

12:55.929 --> 12:58.030
That's fine.
No one has even seen her yet.

Don't you want to be the first
to bring her into the sun?

13:01.835 --> 13:06.305
Fine.
Let me see her.

13:06.373 --> 13:09.375

18:03.770 --> 18:05.404
Well, you know,
it's a tough business.

18:05.472 --> 18:06.806
Maybe she's eliminating
the competition.

18:06.873 --> 18:07.973
Why don't you
go distract her

18:08.041 --> 18:09.442

her dressing room?

18:09.509 --> 18:11.210
But I don't know
how to distract her.

18:15.682 --> 18:17.650
So what's your favorite movie?

18:17.718 --> 18:19.752
God, I hate that.

18:19.820 --> 18:21.320
Yeah, me too.

18:21.388 --> 18:22.855
I mean, there's, like, eight
billion different movies, right?

18:22.923 --> 18:24.190

pick just one.

18:24.257 --> 18:26.292

my real favorite movie

18:26.359 --> 18:27.426

18:27.494 --> 18:28.694
the first movie

18:34.468 --> 18:36.335
What High School did you go to?

18:36.403 --> 18:38.304
Why all the questions
about my past?

18:38.371 --> 18:40.573
It was just one question.
You made me ask it twice.

18:44.277 --> 18:45.644
So what can I get you guys?

18:45.712 --> 18:46.946
BLT, please.

18:47.013 --> 18:48.547
Okay.

18:48.615 --> 18:50.716
I would like the chili,
extra onions.

18:55.188 --> 18:56.922
Guess no good-bye kiss,
huh?

18:56.990 --> 18:58.891
What?
The onions.

18:58.959 --> 19:00.626
Bad breath.

19:00.694 --> 19:02.261
Kissing.
It's--bad joke.

19:02.329 --> 19:03.295
Sorry.

19:03.363 --> 19:05.064
No.

19:05.132 --> 19:07.533
I mean, yes,
I could get it to go.

19:07.601 --> 19:08.634
No, no, no.
Eat it later

19:08.702 --> 19:10.569
after non-onion breath
kissing.

19:10.637 --> 19:12.605
Not that I'm expecting kissing.

19:12.672 --> 19:14.840
Not that I was
expecting kissing or not.

19:14.908 --> 19:18.043
Or maybe.

19:18.111 --> 19:21.046

grilled cheese.

19:21.114 --> 19:22.548

19:53.346 --> 19:55.347
My advice:

19:55.415 --> 19:57.349
Spanx.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.418
You know,
I'm always amazed

19:59.486 --> 20:01.387
at the correlation
between being beautiful

20:01.454 --> 20:03.722
and being a complete bitch.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.562
Being a successful model
isn't about beauty

20:09.629 --> 20:11.664
and it certainly
isn't about the clothes.

20:11.731 --> 20:13.465
Well, then what's it about?

20:13.533 --> 20:16.468
When I walk down
the runway,

20:16.536 --> 20:18.704
with one look
I can stop a war

20:18.772 --> 20:20.306
or start one.

20:20.373 --> 20:22.141
I make people want something
that I have,

20:22.209 --> 20:24.977
because when I'm out there
I tear out my soul

20:25.045 --> 20:26.745
and I offer it
for everyone to see.

20:29.216 --> 20:31.917
You think you can do that,
sister?

20:39.993 --> 20:41.727
Jenny,
the schedule, please.

20:41.795 --> 20:44.430
I'll be right there.

21:00.981 --> 21:03.115
Booyah Buddha.

21:03.183 --> 21:05.351
I don't suppose you gave
the same sisterly advice

21:05.418 --> 21:06.552
to Anya.

21:06.620 --> 21:07.853
Anya shoulda
stayed in Russia

21:07.921 --> 21:09.088
and stuck
with what she knew--

21:09.155 --> 21:11.223
borscht and bread lines.

21:11.291 --> 21:15.094
Sounds to me
like you're glad she's dead.

21:15.161 --> 21:17.263
You're very nosy.

21:17.330 --> 21:18.831
No, I'm just curious
about the people I work with.

21:23.036 --> 21:24.703
I wonder if the next girl

21:24.771 --> 21:27.573
will ask
what happened to you.

21:42.389 --> 21:44.356
It's all over, Jenny.

21:44.424 --> 21:46.091
What are you talking about?
Is that it?

21:46.159 --> 21:47.459
Oh, crap.

21:47.527 --> 21:50.362
Jenny,
why are you doing it?

21:50.430 --> 21:52.264
I'm not hurting anybody.

21:52.332 --> 21:53.699
Then you've got a pretty
whacked-out definition

21:53.767 --> 21:54.700
of "hurt," lady.

21:54.768 --> 21:56.535
They can afford to pay.

21:56.603 --> 21:58.203
Is that how Anya paid,
with her youth?

21:58.271 --> 21:59.371
How did you kill her, Jenny?

21:59.439 --> 22:01.106
I didn't kill Anya.

22:01.174 --> 22:02.141
She wasn't even a customer.

22:02.208 --> 22:03.609
A customer?

22:03.677 --> 22:06.712
No, look, how is the Buddha
aging the models?

22:06.780 --> 22:08.881
What are you talking about?

22:08.949 --> 22:10.449
What are you talking about?

22:10.517 --> 22:11.617
Diet pills.

22:11.685 --> 22:12.885
Diet what now?

22:12.953 --> 22:14.687
Hey, hey, hey, easy, that's...

22:18.291 --> 22:20.526
Filled with teeny-tiny pills.

22:20.593 --> 22:21.860
You're peddling diet pills?

22:21.928 --> 22:22.962
They're the good ones,

22:23.029 --> 22:25.164
not legal here yet.

22:25.231 --> 22:28.133
I get them on the black market
for the--

22:28.201 --> 22:30.135
you're not here about
the diet pills, are you?

22:30.203 --> 22:32.004
Okay, look,
here's what you're gonna do.

22:32.072 --> 22:33.472
You're gonna go home,
you're gonna call in sick,

22:33.540 --> 22:35.607
and you're gonna stay there
until you hear from me,

22:35.675 --> 22:37.943
or you'll be explaining that
little bobble-headed Buddha

22:38.011 --> 22:39.645
to the DEA.

22:39.713 --> 22:41.513
Or I can hook you up
if you let me go.

22:41.581 --> 22:45.050
You could lose those extra
five pounds by, like, tomorrow.

22:45.118 --> 22:46.952
I don't have
an extra five pounds.

22:47.020 --> 22:48.887
Right.

22:48.955 --> 22:50.322
Go!

22:50.390 --> 22:51.957
Okay.

22:53.893 --> 22:55.694
Myka, we're running
out of time.

22:55.762 --> 22:57.796
I know.

22:57.864 --> 23:02.067
I couldn't believe it
when you finally called.

23:02.135 --> 23:05.704
Anticipation
has been interminable.

23:05.772 --> 23:09.108
You said you found her,
the one?

23:15.181 --> 23:18.917
Yes, she's perfect.

that Pete sent over

23:30.789 --> 23:32.724
of silver nitrate in it,

23:32.791 --> 23:34.626
which is not commonly found
in human blood.

23:34.693 --> 23:36.327
Ha ha, what does that mean?

23:36.395 --> 23:38.262
I have no idea.

33:33.241 --> 33:34.709
Wait, wait, wait,
it was also used

33:34.776 --> 33:37.445
in the manufacture
of photographic film.

33:39.748 --> 33:41.015
I was doing something.

33:41.083 --> 33:42.583
Gus used to say--

33:42.651 --> 33:44.118
Gus was a former
Warehouse Agent--

33:44.186 --> 33:46.887
and he used to say
that there was a camera

33:46.955 --> 33:49.991
that belonged to--there.

33:50.058 --> 33:52.026
Man Ray.

33:52.094 --> 33:53.260
I'm on it.
Give me an address.

33:53.328 --> 33:54.695
But he's dead, he's dead.
What?

33:54.763 --> 33:56.230
Yeah, he was a photographer
in the 1930s.

33:56.298 --> 33:57.631
Guy shot
some wicked cool pics.

33:57.699 --> 33:59.233
Contemporary of Salvador Dali,

33:59.301 --> 34:01.068
except that Ray was into
photographic surrealism.

34:01.136 --> 34:03.004
And Gus used to say
that one of Ray's last cameras

34:03.071 --> 34:05.306
had artifact properties.

34:05.374 --> 34:07.541
It's just we never found it.

34:07.609 --> 34:09.310
Well, so then it's gotta
be one of the photographers.

34:09.378 --> 34:10.978
Which brings us back
to what Claudia was doing

34:11.045 --> 34:12.947
before Artie so rudely
took her computer.

34:13.014 --> 34:15.683
I hacked into the fashion show
security cameras.

34:15.751 --> 34:17.518
Now let me just get
a good angle.

34:17.585 --> 34:19.420
There, that guy.
Check the camera.

34:19.487 --> 34:20.755
Not exactly
state-of-the-art, right?

34:20.822 --> 34:21.956
Right.

34:22.024 --> 34:23.123
Now look,
he takes Myka's picture,

34:23.190 --> 34:24.225
he walks.

34:24.292 --> 34:27.395
Artie and Claudia:
It's him.

34:36.772 --> 34:39.106
Can I interest you in changing
your long distance carrier?

34:39.174 --> 34:41.007
No thanks.

34:41.076 --> 34:43.110
Can I interest you
in staying alive, huh?

34:43.178 --> 34:44.478
Where is it?

34:44.545 --> 34:45.746
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:45.813 --> 34:49.417
I said where is it?

34:52.120 --> 34:53.954
Claudia, Man Ray's.

34:54.022 --> 34:55.723
Jackpot.

34:55.791 --> 34:59.160
And that is not all.

34:59.227 --> 35:01.529
Hey, hey, hey, Myka said
there was an old lady

35:01.596 --> 35:03.164
giving her the stink eye,

35:03.231 --> 35:05.366
and she had on
huge Ruby earrings.

35:05.434 --> 35:08.235
This camera doesn't just
steal people's youth.

35:08.303 --> 35:10.671
It transfers it
to another person.

35:10.739 --> 35:13.541
You've been peddling
a second chance at life.

35:13.608 --> 35:16.377
How does the camera work,
huh?

35:16.445 --> 35:18.145
How does the camera work?

35:18.213 --> 35:19.747
Pete, lay off.
We might need this guy.

35:19.815 --> 35:23.517
All right.

35:23.585 --> 35:25.820
You double-expose a younger
photograph over someone older.

35:25.887 --> 35:29.423
The process
is almost instantaneous.

35:29.491 --> 35:30.825
Myka and the others
didn't change right away.

35:30.892 --> 35:32.059
No, no, no, that would be
a little too public,

35:32.127 --> 35:33.160
wouldn't it?

35:33.228 --> 35:34.895
What you did is you figured out

35:34.963 --> 35:36.330
how to do it later.

35:36.398 --> 35:39.433
Something to do with
the development process, right?

35:39.501 --> 35:41.235
Did you hear the question?

35:41.303 --> 35:43.504
Do you doubt that my friend
wants to beat your to death?

35:45.974 --> 35:49.009
It works retroactively

35:49.077 --> 35:50.744
if I wait and use
the developer.

35:50.812 --> 35:52.046
The silver nitrate.

35:53.615 --> 35:55.850
Right?
Silver nitrate.

35:55.917 --> 35:57.251
But why models?

35:57.319 --> 35:58.552
I mean, why not
just snap pictures

35:58.620 --> 36:00.054
of anonymous young people?

36:00.122 --> 36:02.823
You ever heard the expression
"make love to the camera?"

36:02.891 --> 36:04.859
A model has a gift.

36:04.926 --> 36:06.293
She bares her soul,

36:06.361 --> 36:08.662
opens up.

36:08.730 --> 36:10.965
Manny's camera captures it,

36:11.032 --> 36:12.500
reacts to it.

36:12.567 --> 36:14.168
How do we turn Myka back?

36:17.038 --> 36:18.739
Look out!

36:24.746 --> 36:26.580
Artie!

36:27.805 --> 36:28.705
They told me what happened.

36:29.568 --> 36:31.670
You, young man,

36:31.737 --> 36:34.205
have to stop playing with fire.

36:34.273 --> 36:35.740
Yeah, close call.

36:35.808 --> 36:38.076
I didn't need
the Phoenix this time.

36:38.144 --> 36:39.744
I remembered to duck.

36:39.812 --> 36:42.113
Doctors say
you're doing great.

36:42.181 --> 36:43.348
Liar.

36:47.186 --> 36:48.653
How are you?

36:48.721 --> 36:51.089
I just wish I could see
my mom and dad.

36:53.159 --> 36:55.593
They could never cope
with this.

36:57.530 --> 37:00.231
Artie, I just want to tell you

37:00.299 --> 37:03.368
that, um,

37:03.436 --> 37:06.104
I know I've been
hard on you sometimes.

37:06.172 --> 37:08.506
Don't.

37:08.574 --> 37:11.943
Okay?
Don't--don't start that.

37:12.011 --> 37:13.478
I'm not giving up on you.

37:13.546 --> 37:14.913
Don't you give up.

37:18.184 --> 37:20.852
All right, listen,

37:20.920 --> 37:23.188
we have to find
this Ruby earring woman.

37:23.255 --> 37:24.889
We have to take a new
photograph of her young

37:24.957 --> 37:27.492
and superimpose it on
a photograph of old Myka.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.361
And it might
switch her back?

37:29.428 --> 37:32.130
Well, I'm
in his bank account.

37:32.198 --> 37:35.100
And he hasn't touched anything
since the last deposit but--

37:35.167 --> 37:37.502
something?

37:37.570 --> 37:38.837
Well, he's got
a serious crush on someone.

37:38.904 --> 37:40.605
He's had flowers delivered
from the same shop

37:40.673 --> 37:41.840
three times this week.

37:41.907 --> 37:43.441
Does it say to who?

37:43.509 --> 37:45.143
No, this just lists
his transactions.

37:45.211 --> 37:47.846
Romana.
What?

37:47.913 --> 37:50.515
Romana had flowers
delivered to her,

37:50.583 --> 37:53.418
and she wasn't very happy
with whoever sent them.

37:53.486 --> 37:55.286
I'm on it,
I'm on it.

37:55.354 --> 37:56.454
You see?

37:56.522 --> 37:58.523
Even at 90,
you are a crack Agent.

37:58.591 --> 37:59.858
Pete, wait.

37:59.925 --> 38:01.292
What if you find him
and he doesn't tell you

38:01.360 --> 38:02.460
who he sold
Myka's youth to?

38:02.528 --> 38:03.828
Do we find someone else,

38:03.896 --> 38:05.397
take someone else's youth?

38:05.464 --> 38:08.800
I mean, someone bad?

38:08.868 --> 38:10.235
He'll tell me.

38:10.302 --> 38:12.203
Go.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.808
Consider me an ex-fan
of man Ray.

38:16.876 --> 38:19.110
Manny's.
What?

38:19.178 --> 38:21.780
Perry didn't say
man Ray's camera.

38:21.847 --> 38:23.715
He said Manny's.

38:23.783 --> 38:26.017
So?

38:26.085 --> 38:28.186
Romana.

38:28.254 --> 38:30.055
Oh, Perry, you scared me
half to death.

38:30.122 --> 38:31.823
I haven't got much time.
I need you to listen to me.

38:31.891 --> 38:34.159
What do you want?
I think you know.

38:34.226 --> 38:35.460
We've been through this.

38:35.528 --> 38:38.029
You and I,
we're never gonna happen.

38:38.097 --> 38:39.664
That's right.

38:39.732 --> 38:41.132
I'm not your type, am I?

38:41.200 --> 38:42.634
Rich and powerful.

38:42.701 --> 38:45.470
Guess what,
I'm both now.

38:45.538 --> 38:48.706
What is that
supposed to mean?

38:48.774 --> 38:50.708
I never used the camera
for financial gain.

38:50.776 --> 38:52.210
What camera?

38:52.278 --> 38:53.678
Until I met you.

38:53.746 --> 38:55.613
You know what,
I have to go.

38:55.681 --> 38:58.349
I'm finally
wealthy enough now

38:58.417 --> 39:01.619
to have the most beautiful
woman in the world.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.321
You'll never have
that much money.

39:03.389 --> 39:06.091
Don't you understand?

39:06.158 --> 39:08.893
Everything I did was for you,

39:08.961 --> 39:11.029
for us to be together.

39:11.097 --> 39:12.864
Just let go of me.

39:12.932 --> 39:14.299
Let go of me.

39:25.077 --> 39:26.377
Hey!

39:29.882 --> 39:32.917
You've had Man Ray's camera
for a long time,

39:32.985 --> 39:34.052
haven't you?

39:34.120 --> 39:36.588
In fact,
you actually knew Manny.

39:36.655 --> 39:38.523
I modeled for him
when I was 22 years old.

39:38.591 --> 39:40.024
He gave me that camera.

39:40.092 --> 39:42.026
I kept it all these years.

39:42.094 --> 39:43.561
And that's
how you discovered

39:43.629 --> 39:47.499
its restorative properties,
Hmm?

39:47.566 --> 39:51.469
And the first person
that it turned young

39:51.537 --> 39:52.770
was you.

39:52.838 --> 39:55.106
I look pretty good for 98.

39:55.174 --> 39:58.209
And how many innocent lives
did your vitality cost?

39:58.277 --> 40:00.545
I would imagine
you double exposed my image

40:00.613 --> 40:02.814
with your friend's.

40:06.685 --> 40:08.153
You've been young long enough.

40:19.031 --> 40:20.865
Back again.

40:27.072 --> 40:29.140
Excuse me.
Oh.

40:32.511 --> 40:33.645
Are you okay?

40:33.712 --> 40:36.514
Well, yeah.
Thanks to you guys.

40:38.717 --> 40:40.585
Well, you know,
it's in my contract,

40:40.653 --> 40:43.021
if my partner turns
into a senior citizen

40:43.088 --> 40:44.489
and I don't do
anything about it,

40:44.557 --> 40:46.324
it's, like, six vacation days,
so I didn't really--

40:46.392 --> 40:48.459
yeah.
It was all about the vacation.

40:48.527 --> 40:49.894
Yeah.

40:49.962 --> 40:52.130
I'm so glad to see you
looking like the old you.

40:52.198 --> 40:53.598
I mean, the young old you,

40:53.666 --> 40:55.200
not the old, old you--

40:55.267 --> 40:57.035
come on, gramps, you're having
one of your mini strokes again.

40:57.102 --> 40:58.937
You are aware
that I'm your boss, right?

40:59.004 --> 41:00.738
You know that?
Yes, crabby, come on.

41:00.806 --> 41:03.541
Um, Pete.
Yes?

41:03.609 --> 41:06.244
You know,
I just want to say thank you.

41:06.312 --> 41:07.946
You're welcome.

41:08.013 --> 41:11.182
Not--not--not for--

41:11.250 --> 41:14.385
for what you said
before the show.

41:14.453 --> 41:16.254
Right, we don't have
to ever mention that again.

41:16.322 --> 41:18.456
But remember you said
that I--

41:18.524 --> 41:19.924
la, la, la.
Can't hear--

41:19.992 --> 41:21.259
I think that we should--

41:21.327 --> 41:23.461
warning! Warning!
Danger, Will Robinson.

41:24.496 --> 41:26.564
Okay.

41:29.401 --> 41:31.970
No cream.
Why are we doing this?

41:32.037 --> 41:33.304
You don't see enough of me?

41:33.372 --> 41:35.907
Sit down.

41:35.975 --> 41:37.475
I owe you an apology.

41:37.543 --> 41:38.876
You owe me lots of apologies.

41:38.944 --> 41:40.345
Which one's nagging
at you right now?

41:40.412 --> 41:43.014
The one about Todd.

41:43.082 --> 41:44.983
Not a big deal.
Yeah, it is.

41:45.050 --> 41:46.184
It doesn't matter.
It does matter,

41:46.252 --> 41:47.852
because he's really
a good kid,

41:47.920 --> 41:49.821
and I should be able to help.

41:49.888 --> 41:51.789
You didn't make me
a train wreck.

41:51.857 --> 41:54.292
You are not a train wreck,
Claudia.

41:54.360 --> 41:56.828
I just sometimes forget

41:56.895 --> 41:58.663
that underneath the talented
computer programmer

41:58.731 --> 42:00.965
and fearless
junior Warehouse Agent

42:01.033 --> 42:02.967
there beats the heart
of a teenage girl

42:03.035 --> 42:07.171
who deserves, well,
someone better than me

42:07.239 --> 42:10.541
for a...

42:10.609 --> 42:12.543
Uh...

42:12.611 --> 42:14.312
Father figure?

42:14.380 --> 42:17.949
Oh, my God.

42:18.017 --> 42:20.318
You're not doing so bad.

42:20.386 --> 42:22.920
Well, I--
I could do a little better.

42:22.988 --> 42:24.255
I'll do--
you know, I can do better.

42:24.323 --> 42:26.891
Sometimes you are so cute.
Don't do that.

42:26.959 --> 42:28.626
I hate that word.
Don't use that word, cute.

42:28.694 --> 42:30.862
I'm not cute.

42:30.929 --> 42:32.764
Well, I am relieved.

42:32.831 --> 42:34.132
When you said,
"meet me at the diner,"

42:34.199 --> 42:35.667
I thought you'd arranged
some lame meet

42:35.734 --> 42:36.801
with me and Todd.

42:36.869 --> 42:40.738
Um, Todd.

42:40.806 --> 42:43.308
What a remarkable coincidence.

42:43.375 --> 42:44.642
Hey.

42:44.710 --> 42:46.844
Hey.

42:49.014 --> 42:50.381
I don't know
if I mentioned this before,

42:50.449 --> 42:52.784
but I really like chili.

42:56.221 --> 42:58.222
Artie, get out.

42:58.290 --> 42:59.390
Yes, leaving.
Ahem.
