00:01.169 --> 00:02.835
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:02.870 --> 00:05.405
You seem determined
to put an end to all my fun,

00:05.506 --> 00:07.641
just like you always did
when we were dating.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.377
You dated a troll?

00:09.410 --> 00:11.079
Well, he wasn't a troll then.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.746
He was just
a big, dumb guy.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.647
-Where is everyone?
-At the new high school.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.317
Buffy's got some kind
of job there.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.885
Spike's been staying
in the basement.
(Screaming)

00:18.919 --> 00:21.355
-Willow?
-There you are.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.657
We're really glad
that you're back.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.993
Did you turn this nice lady's ex
into a giant worm monster?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.996
(Laughs)
Yes.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.100
I got the impression
that you enjoy inflicting--

00:33.134 --> 00:35.103
Causing pain sounds
really cool, I know,

00:35.136 --> 00:38.405
but turns out
it's really upsetting.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.508
-Didn't used to be.
-It's the talk of the order.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.076
-They're calling you
Miss Soft Serve.
-Excuse me?

00:43.110 --> 00:46.447
No deaths, no eviscerations,
you're not goading women
into anything inventive,

00:46.479 --> 00:48.115
and you're not delivering
when it is.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.783
It was a glitch. I am
so back in the vengeance fold.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.759
My advice to you is do exactly
what everyone else does
all the time.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.429
-Got it.
-Do what everyone else does,

01:01.462 --> 01:04.230
wear what everyone else wears,
say what everyone else says.

01:04.265 --> 01:07.867
-Okay.
-People may say something
to you you don't understand.

01:07.900 --> 01:11.371
Just don't be afraid to keep
your mouth shut and pretend like
you know what they're saying.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.307
You know, Dawn,
I've been to college before.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.611
People may say something
like, "My protein window
closes in an hour."

01:17.644 --> 01:20.914
Just nod and smile.
"Mm-hmm."

01:20.948 --> 01:23.049
Turns out it has something
to do with fitness.

01:23.082 --> 01:24.951
BUFFY:
Have you talked
to her lately?

01:24.984 --> 01:27.320
Not since that night
with the Gnarl demon.

01:27.355 --> 01:30.890
And that wasn't exactly
the kind of "How have you
been?" kind of talking.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.593
More the "Pierce its eye
with something sharp"
kind of talking.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.962
I'm thinking
I should call her.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.966
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

01:38.998 --> 01:41.100
"Hopes"?
(Scoffs)
Oh, no, no, no.

01:41.134 --> 01:45.639
There are no hopes.
Anya and I are done.
I love being single.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.475
I'm a strong, successful male
who's giddy at the thought...

01:48.509 --> 01:51.145
of all the women
I will no doubt be dating
in the near future.

01:51.179 --> 01:54.347
Strong, successful males
say "giddy"?

01:54.382 --> 01:58.018
-I just worry about her.
That's all.
-Anya?

01:58.051 --> 02:00.754
Yeah. She seems so sad.

02:00.787 --> 02:04.123
She should try acting
like everybody else more.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.426
Apparently,
it's what all the kids
are doin' nowadays.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.596
Well, I'm not sure
I get the sad vibe,

02:08.627 --> 02:11.164
but there's definitely
a vengeance vibe
worth worrying about.

02:11.199 --> 02:14.268
Oh, that? No, no.
I don't worry about that.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.870
She was hurt,
and she just turned back
to what she knew...

02:16.903 --> 02:20.674
when I, you know.

02:20.707 --> 02:25.278
But that's not her
anymore.
I hope you're right.

02:25.312 --> 02:29.015
She turned that worm guy back
before any real damage
happened, right?

02:29.049 --> 02:31.117
It'll just
take some time.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.020
I really think
she's coming around.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.192
What have I done?

03:17.397 --> 03:20.533
(Theme music plays)

04:14.288 --> 04:16.122
(Murmurs)

04:19.793 --> 04:21.228
(Chuckles)

04:21.261 --> 04:24.697
(Speaking Old Norse)

04:28.336 --> 04:30.971
(Speaking Old Norse)

04:56.129 --> 04:58.230
(Battle-ax Clatters)

05:46.045 --> 05:47.346
(Sighs)

07:04.091 --> 07:06.793
SPIKE:
I don't trust
what I see anymore.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.463
I don't know how
to explain it exactly.

07:11.163 --> 07:13.800
It's like I've been
seein' things.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.372
Dru used to see things,
you know?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.677
She'd always be
starin' up at the sky
watchin' cherubs burn...

07:23.711 --> 07:26.480
or the heavens bleed
or some nonsense.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.218
I used to stare at her
and think she'd gone
completely "sack of hammers."

07:34.487 --> 07:37.790
But she'd see the sky
when we were inside,

07:37.824 --> 07:39.927
and it'd make her so happy.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.730
She'd see showers.
She'd see stars.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.266
Now I see her.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.103
Spike.
I'm in trouble, Buffy.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.004
I can help you.

07:55.675 --> 07:58.478
(Exhales)

07:58.512 --> 08:01.014
I could never ask,
not after--

08:04.016 --> 08:07.286
It's different.
You're different.

08:07.319 --> 08:09.557
I could never ask.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.726
Spike, it's me.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.862
It's you and it's me,
and we'll get through this.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.033
Never.

08:23.435 --> 08:25.271
We'll get through this.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.720
Spike.
This basement is killing you.

08:41.453 --> 08:44.356
This is the Hellmouth.
There is something bad
down here--

08:44.390 --> 08:46.894
possibly everything bad.

08:46.927 --> 08:50.998
(Laughing)

08:51.030 --> 08:53.600
Can't hear you.
Can't hear you.

08:53.634 --> 08:56.604
You have a soul?
Fine. Show me.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.740
Scream "Montressor"
all you like, pet.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.375
Get up and get out
of this basement.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.548
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

09:09.582 --> 09:12.852
(Bells Tolling)
(People Chattering)

09:12.885 --> 09:16.590
It's not like I've been gone
for that long, and I've already
done all the reading I missed.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.958
And I can sign up--
Willow, Willow.
It's okay.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.561
We'll get you caught up
in no time.
Really?

09:21.595 --> 09:25.465
What am I gonna say, "No,
I don't want my best student
back in my class"?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.801
Of course I noticed
that drop-off in your grades
at midterms last year,

09:27.835 --> 09:29.802
and I was concerned.
Yeah, that was--

09:29.836 --> 09:31.804
But then, voilÃ ,
you turned it around...

09:31.838 --> 09:34.441
and aced all your finals
like, boom--magic.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.943
(Uneasy Chuckle)
Yeah, similar to but--
Look,

09:36.976 --> 09:39.479
come see me during
office hours tomorrow,

09:39.511 --> 09:40.880
and we'll talk about
what we need to do

09:40.913 --> 09:42.282
to get you caught up,
all right?

09:42.315 --> 09:44.451
Uh, okay.
Thanks, Professor.

09:45.753 --> 09:49.822
Anya.
Anya.

09:49.856 --> 09:53.961
Willow, hi.
What are you doing here?

09:53.994 --> 09:56.730
Oh, I am starting
back up at school again.

09:56.764 --> 10:00.299
Yeah, I can't believe
how great everyone's been.

10:00.332 --> 10:03.503
I-I was a little worried,
but I already have books
and homework,

10:03.535 --> 10:06.173
and they even said they'd give
me periodic surprise quizzes...

10:06.206 --> 10:09.341
just to make up
for the ones
that I missed and--

10:09.375 --> 10:14.014
Wh-What--
What are you doin' here...

10:14.047 --> 10:16.850
walkin' out of
the fraternity house
in the middle of the day?

10:16.884 --> 10:20.988
Oh, I--Um,

10:21.020 --> 10:23.823
I have a new boyfriend now.
He lives here.

10:23.856 --> 10:27.494
-That's great.
-Yeah. We just had
lots and lots of sex.

10:27.527 --> 10:30.697
Okay.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.000
This is so great.
I am so happy
to see you've...

10:34.301 --> 10:36.669
moved on.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.706
Yes, we're tremendously happy
together.

10:38.739 --> 10:43.143
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for something...
important.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.712
Oh, okay.
See ya later.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.424
Hello?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.695
Is anybod--

11:27.220 --> 11:29.588
(Woman Whimpering)
I take it back.

11:29.621 --> 11:32.225
(Whimpering Continues)
I take it back.
I take it back.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.697
I take it back.
I take it back.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.533
I take it back.
I take it--

11:41.567 --> 11:45.238
I take it back.
I take it back.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.207
I take it back.
I take it back.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.076
(Whimpering)
I take it back.

11:50.110 --> 11:53.546
I take it back.
I take it back.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.783
-I take it back.
-It's okay.
You're okay.

11:56.817 --> 12:01.053
-(Sobbing)
I-I take it back.
-What? What do you take back?

12:01.087 --> 12:03.590
What happened?
There's gonna be a party.

12:03.623 --> 12:06.458
(Crying)
Everyone's gonna be there.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.428
Everyone's bringing a date.
I'll have a great time.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.033
But it was just me...

12:13.066 --> 12:15.434
and them.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.739
(Sobs)
He broke up with me
in front of them.

12:21.607 --> 12:25.312
I was a game.
It was all a game.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.048
Uh, it's okay.
You're okay now.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.884
They laughed,
and they laughed.

12:30.918 --> 12:35.154
And I cried,
and they laughed.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.090
And I yelled, "Just once,

12:39.459 --> 12:43.129
"I wish you could all feel
what it's like to have
your hearts ripped out.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.599
(Sobs)
"Just once, I wish--"

12:48.034 --> 12:52.404
(Crying)
And then it came.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.506
Okay.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.943
Come on. What came?
What did this?

12:56.976 --> 12:59.111
A spider.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.349
Where did it go?

13:02.381 --> 13:07.120
(Breath Quavering)
What do you mean?

13:07.153 --> 13:09.889
The spider--
where is it now?

13:17.831 --> 13:22.034
-(Whimpering)
-(Creature Screeching)

13:22.068 --> 13:24.803
Protect!

13:24.837 --> 13:26.538
(Whimpering)

13:26.572 --> 13:29.341
For God's sake,
shut your whimpering mouth!

13:35.014 --> 13:38.750
(Girl Gasping Softly)

13:44.157 --> 13:45.993
I-I'm sorry.

(All Yelling)

14:18.091 --> 14:20.592

14:35.542 --> 14:39.511
Impressive.
Thank you.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.115
What is that,
a Woodlow transmogrific spell?

14:43.149 --> 14:46.619
Thornton's Hope.
Thornton's Hope?

But how did you get
the troll element?

Eel's-bane.
Brilliant.

Bar matron.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.436
A load-bearing
bar matron.
Is there any other kind?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.808
I'm sorry.
How rude of me.

15:09.841 --> 15:13.379
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is D'Hoffryn.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.883
I am Aud.
Are you?

15:16.916 --> 15:20.653
(Chuckles)
I am afraid you don't
see your true self.

15:20.687 --> 15:24.423
You are Anyanka.

15:24.456 --> 15:27.927
I'm a patron
of a family of sorts.
We're vengeance demons.

15:27.961 --> 15:31.130
I'm sure
you've heard of us.
No. I'm sorry.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.765
Oh, well, that's quite--
No, don't feel bad.

15:33.799 --> 15:37.336
I, uh--I don't
talk to people much.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.240
I mean, I talk to them,
but they don't talk to me...

15:40.273 --> 15:42.341
except to say that
your questions are irksome...

15:42.375 --> 15:44.943
and perhaps you should take
your furs and your literal
interpretations...

15:44.977 --> 15:46.879
to the other side
of the river.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.951
(Women Yelling)

15:52.985 --> 15:56.489
I get the sense that
your talents are not fully
appreciated here, Anyanka.

15:56.523 --> 16:00.626
We'd like you to join us.
Why do you keep calling me that?
My name is Aud.

16:00.659 --> 16:04.431
Perhaps.
But Anyanka is who you are.

16:04.464 --> 16:08.168
What would I have to do?

16:08.201 --> 16:12.438
What you do best--
help wronged women
punish evil men.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.341
(Olaf Grunting)

16:17.210 --> 16:20.312
Vengeance.
But only to those
who deserve it.

16:20.346 --> 16:24.083
They all deserve it.
That's where I was
goin' with that, yeah.

16:31.390 --> 16:35.028
(Ringing)
Oh! Hello.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.663
Willow, hey, is everything--

16:37.697 --> 16:40.332
Oh. Spider demon.
Wait. Hold on.

16:40.366 --> 16:44.571
Are you all right?
Uh. Like how?

16:44.604 --> 16:47.539
Uh-huh. Uh-huh, wait.
Okay, go ahead.

16:47.573 --> 16:50.842
No, no, no, no.
It's all good.
I'll get Xander to go.

16:50.876 --> 16:53.011
But, seriously, you just--

16:53.046 --> 16:57.649
What, ripped out the heart?
My God.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.985
Hey, did you get
that physics class
you wanted?

17:00.019 --> 17:03.056
This is just wonderful,
Anyanka.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.192
There's even talk
of having some sort
of ceremony.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.228
I can't tell you
how many times today
I've heard,

17:08.260 --> 17:11.762
"Anyanka is back
to her old self again."

17:11.798 --> 17:13.633
Honey, what is it?
What's wrong?

17:15.768 --> 17:17.636
It's nothing.
I just--

17:20.207 --> 17:23.442
There was just so much
screaming, so much blood.
Mmm.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.679
I--I'd forgotten
how much damage
a Crimslaw demon could do.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.949
Oh, tell me about it.
They can be feisty little guys.

17:29.981 --> 17:34.453
And impossible to house-train.
I mean, once they start nesting,
forget--

17:34.487 --> 17:36.788
Are you okay?
Oh, did something happen?

17:38.490 --> 17:41.728
I guess I'm just
a little rusty.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.263
I didn't think it would
hit me like this.

17:44.297 --> 17:48.300
Oh, sweetie.
This is perfectly normal.

17:48.335 --> 17:52.439
It's a reflex.
You'll get over it in no time.
Trust me.

17:52.471 --> 17:56.909
Oh, Hallie, I can't tell you
how good it is.

17:56.942 --> 18:00.247
Thank goodness you're here.
Oh, sweetie, of course.

18:00.279 --> 18:03.650
It's just, lately,
what with everything
that's been going on,

18:03.682 --> 18:05.917
I've had trouble
even remembering--
(Door Opens)

18:05.951 --> 18:09.588
-Get out.
-Lemon drop.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.824
-If you think I'm gonna--
-Get out.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.163
It's okay.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.298
Well, okay.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.866
If you need anything,
you holler.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.507
Anya, you have to stop this.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.512
Do you know
what they did to her?
Do you?

18:35.548 --> 18:37.616
It was a game.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.118
They were humiliating her.
Anya, listen to me.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.122
You're in trouble.
You know it.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.958
I'm here to help you.

18:45.991 --> 18:48.494
(Laughing)
You're here to--

18:48.528 --> 18:50.697
Well, that's great, Willow.

18:50.730 --> 18:54.334
Flayed anybody lately, have you?
How quickly they forget.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.868
I haven't forgotten
one second of it.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.008
-What do you want?
-I want to help you.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.178
-They got what they deserved.
-No. They--

19:05.211 --> 19:07.846
I am a vengeance demon.
Do you understand that?

19:07.880 --> 19:10.082
No.
Try.

19:13.085 --> 19:16.355
They got what they deserved.

19:16.388 --> 19:19.157
Thanks for sidekicking.
I didn't want
to trouble Willow.

19:19.192 --> 19:22.060
I figure
she's got enough to do,
first day back and all.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.663
Are you kidding?
We're doing vent work
at the site.

19:24.696 --> 19:27.567
Anything's better
than breathing Freon
for eight hours.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.635
So, she say
what this thing is?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.837
Some sort of
spider demony thingy.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.641
She had to go pretty quickly.
I think she had to sign up
for classes or something.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.976
Ah, yes. There is little
that can distract the Willow...

19:37.009 --> 19:39.979
when she's on the hunt
for the mighty syllabi.

19:40.011 --> 19:43.583
I don't know. I think
she's a little more nervous
than she was letting... on.

19:46.719 --> 19:50.423
How big
she say this thing was?
She didn't.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.826
But I can't imagine
she'd send us out
if it wasn't--

19:53.859 --> 19:56.695
The heart's
completely ripped out.
This is our guy.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.499
Or a copycat spider demon.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.067
What's this black stuff?
I don't know.

20:05.471 --> 20:08.607
Oh! It's sticky.
Willow said
it was a spider demon.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.778
Maybe it's his webbing.
This isn't springy,
high-flying fun.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.280
(Scraping)
Xander.

20:18.317 --> 20:20.019
(Scraping)
XANDER:
Is that it?

20:20.051 --> 20:24.723
I can't tell.
There's definitely
something moving up there.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.526
Maybe we can somehow
lure it.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.961
-(Grunts)
-Xander!

20:28.994 --> 20:31.631
(Screeching)

20:31.663 --> 20:35.434
(Straining, Groaning)
(Screeching)

20:38.136 --> 20:40.307
(Screaming)
No!

20:43.343 --> 20:45.944
You okay?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.682
Buffy? Where'd it go?

20:51.417 --> 20:53.920
I think
we need more swords.
Uh-huh.

20:53.952 --> 20:56.087
I say we go home,
pick up more swords...

20:56.122 --> 20:58.223
and some sort of
spidery demon
protection amulet.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.259
We come back and--

21:00.292 --> 21:02.028
(Screeching)

21:04.830 --> 21:06.999
Or--

21:07.032 --> 21:10.169
I'm more concerned with
where that thing came from.

21:10.201 --> 21:12.838
If there are more of those
spider demons running around,
we need to know about it.

21:12.872 --> 21:16.241
We should hit the research.
Find out if--

21:16.275 --> 21:19.045
I know
where it came from.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.282
How many?
WILLOW:
Ten, 12.

21:24.317 --> 21:27.920
When were you planning
on telling us?
I'm telling you now.

21:27.953 --> 21:32.023
XANDER:
Great. Thank you.

21:32.057 --> 21:35.193
Willow, it's Anya.
How could you let us--

21:35.227 --> 21:37.663
How could you
not have told us?

21:37.697 --> 21:40.599
Xander.
How could you
not have told me?

21:40.633 --> 21:44.302
Xander, it's okay.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.137
She didn't tell us
for a reason.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.309
She didn't tell us
because she knows
what I have to do.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.383
I have to kill Anya.

22:02.855 --> 22:05.525
(Person Laughing,
Murmuring)
(Utensils Clattering)

22:07.493 --> 22:12.030
(Laughing)
HALFREK: I swear
I'm in awe of you.

22:12.064 --> 22:15.334
Oh, stop.
Oh, I will not.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.636
I grant wishes.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.338
It's all inside the girl.
I just bring it out.
(Cannons Exploding Outside)

22:20.373 --> 22:24.576
Yes, I'm sure this is
what she had in mind.

22:24.611 --> 22:28.414
Well, I don't know
about her mind,
but it was in her heart.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.916
Besides, Russia
was ready to explode.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.051
All we did is just
give it a little push.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.921
What should we do
with the rest
of our evening?

22:34.953 --> 22:37.589
I hear they're going
to raze the Winter Mansion.

22:37.624 --> 22:40.226
Well, I thought we'd head down
to Madame Dubasov's.

22:40.259 --> 22:43.261
No better spot for vengeance
than a brothel.
Oh.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.865
It's always
work, work, work with you.
(Man Gasping)

22:45.897 --> 22:48.233
-(Man Shouts In Russian)
-Well, of course.
What else is there?

22:48.267 --> 22:52.003
-(Man Screaming)
-"What else is there?" Why,
the whole world, for one.

22:52.038 --> 22:55.007
Darling, take a look around.
There's a lot to see.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.175
There's a revolution
going on outside...

22:57.209 --> 22:59.612
(Gunfire)
that you are somewhat
responsible for.

22:59.645 --> 23:02.248
Aren't you the teeniest bit
interested?

23:02.280 --> 23:04.349
What is there
to be interested in?

23:04.383 --> 23:07.053
(People Screaming Outside)
The worker will overthrow
absolutism...

23:07.086 --> 23:09.788
and lead the proletariat
to a victorious
Communist revolution,

23:09.821 --> 23:12.892
resulting in socioeconomic
paradise on earth.

23:12.924 --> 23:17.128
It's common sense really.
I have better things
to worry about.

23:17.163 --> 23:20.266
But, Anyanka, there's
a whole world out there.

23:20.298 --> 23:22.300
Yes, filled with wronged women
who need my help.

23:22.334 --> 23:25.971
Oh, you're talking
about work.
I'm talking about life.

23:26.005 --> 23:30.108
Vengeance is what I do, Halfrek.
I don't need anything else.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.512
Vengeance is what I am.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.316
She's not the Anya
that you knew, Xander.

23:37.348 --> 23:39.951
She's a demon.
That doesn't mean
you have to kill her.

23:39.986 --> 23:43.490
Don't act
like this is easy for me.
You know it's not.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.958
There are other options.

23:45.991 --> 23:48.994
I've considered them.
When?

23:49.028 --> 23:53.132
Just now? Took you
all of 10 seconds to decide to
kill one of your best friends?

23:53.164 --> 23:58.104
The thought
that it might come to this
has occurred to me before.

23:58.136 --> 24:00.405
It's occurred to you too.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.143
But we can change
what she did, fix it.

24:04.175 --> 24:06.444
These are
mystical deaths, right?
There has to be something.

24:06.479 --> 24:09.582
I don't have anywhere near
that kind of power.

24:09.615 --> 24:12.852
I didn't have
that kind of power when--

24:12.884 --> 24:15.788
And I--I don't think
I trust the power I do have.

24:15.821 --> 24:18.423
It's okay.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.493
Xander, I know this is
hard for you to hear,

24:21.528 --> 24:24.130
but it's what I have to do.

24:24.163 --> 24:27.834
Hard for me to hear?
Buffy, you want to kill Anya.

24:27.866 --> 24:30.702
I don't want to.
Then don't.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.438
This isn't new ground for us.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.374
When our friends go all crazy
and start killing people,
we help them.

24:35.406 --> 24:38.611
Sitting right here.
I'm sorry.
But it's true.

24:38.644 --> 24:42.381
It's different.
Because you don't care about her
the same way I do.

24:43.982 --> 24:47.153
Buffy, I still love her.
I know.

24:48.688 --> 24:52.057
And that's why
you can't see this
for what it really is.

24:52.090 --> 24:55.394
Willow was different.
She's a human.

24:55.426 --> 24:58.530
-Anya's a demon.
-And you're the Slayer.

24:59.898 --> 25:02.433
I see now
how it's all very simple.

25:03.736 --> 25:08.708
It is never simple.
No, of course not.

25:08.740 --> 25:12.044
You know, if there's
a mass-murdering demon...

25:12.077 --> 25:15.513
that you're, oh, say, boning,
then it's all gray area.

25:15.548 --> 25:18.183
Spike was harmless.
He was helping.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.553
He had no choice.
And Anya did.

25:20.586 --> 25:23.890
She chose
to become a demon--twice.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.592
You have no idea
what she's going through.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.894
I don't care
what she's going through.
No, of course not.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.029
You think we haven't
all seen this before--

25:31.063 --> 25:34.032
the part where you just
cut us all out,

25:34.066 --> 25:37.169
just step away
from everything human
and act like you're the law?

25:37.202 --> 25:39.739
-If you knew what I felt--
-I killed Angel!

25:44.542 --> 25:46.412
Do you even remember that?

25:47.880 --> 25:51.617
I would have given up
everything I had
to be with--

25:51.651 --> 25:57.455
I loved him more
than I will ever love
anything in this life,

25:57.489 --> 26:00.358
and I put a sword
through his heart
because I had to.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.796
And that all
worked out okay.

26:03.829 --> 26:07.799
Do you remember
cheering me on?
Both of you.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.869
Do you remember giving me
Willow's message?

26:10.903 --> 26:13.705
-"Kick his ass."
-I never said that.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.107
This is different.
It is always different!

26:16.142 --> 26:19.377
It's always complicated.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.713
And, at some point, someone
has to draw the line,

26:21.748 --> 26:23.782
and that is always
going to be me.

26:25.284 --> 26:28.386
You-You get down on me
for cutting myself off,

26:28.420 --> 26:32.590
but, in the end, the Slayer
is always cut off.

26:32.625 --> 26:39.498
There's no mystical guidebook,
no all-knowing council.
Human rules don't apply.

26:39.530 --> 26:42.500
There's only me.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.369
I am the law.

26:47.707 --> 26:51.677
-There has to be another way.
-Then please find it.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.857
(Door Slams)

27:17.536 --> 27:20.673
I can't.
I'm-I'm sorry.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.682
(Door Opens, Closes)

27:42.929 --> 27:45.964
(Speaking In Latin)

27:45.998 --> 27:48.599
...nomina D'Hoffrynis.

27:52.070 --> 27:55.173
(Exhales, Continues In Latin)

28:04.682 --> 28:08.653
Behold D'Hoffryn,
Lord of Arashmahar,

28:08.686 --> 28:12.557
he that turns the air
to blood and rains t--

28:12.590 --> 28:15.728
Ms. Rosenberg,
how lovely to see you again.

28:15.761 --> 28:18.730
Have you done something
with your hair?

28:18.765 --> 28:22.233
Hello, D'Hoffryn.
I figured I'd be
hearing from you soon.

28:22.268 --> 28:26.538
The flaying of Warren Mears--
oh, truly inspired.

28:26.571 --> 28:28.740
That was "watercooler"
vengeance.

28:28.775 --> 28:31.277
Yes. Lloyd has
a sketch of it
on his wall.

28:31.309 --> 28:35.013
That's not me anymore.
Is that right?

28:35.047 --> 28:38.017
So, I didn't feel
your presence
earlier today?

28:38.049 --> 28:41.753
I didn't feel
a bit of the old you?

28:41.788 --> 28:43.923
We need to talk about Anya.

28:43.955 --> 28:46.092
(Sighs)

28:47.659 --> 28:50.628
Very well.
Let's talk about Anyanka.

28:58.136 --> 29:01.807
(Door Opens)
XANDER: I thought
I might find you here.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.375
Have you forced yourself
to look at the bodies yet?

29:04.410 --> 29:08.279
-What do you want?
-I want to help you.

29:08.314 --> 29:12.451
Everyone
is so considerate today.

29:12.483 --> 29:17.423
I should've slaughtered
people weeks ago.
I'm sorry.

29:17.455 --> 29:20.326
I'm sorry
for everything I did to you,
everything I put you through.

29:20.358 --> 29:23.328
Thank you.
All better.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.730
Thank goodness
you got here in time.
You don't understand.

29:25.763 --> 29:30.001
This isn't an intervention.
Buffy's coming to kill you.

29:32.003 --> 29:35.240
-She's coming to try.
-Did everybody have
their "crazyflakes" today?

29:35.273 --> 29:37.809
You guys are friends.
How could you talk like this?

29:37.844 --> 29:41.079
I have a job to do,
and so does Buffy.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.183
Xander, you've always seen
what you wanted to,

29:45.217 --> 29:48.720
but she knew, sooner or later,
it would come to this.

29:50.021 --> 29:53.159
Buffy, get outta here.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.493
-Get out of my way, Xander.
-No.

29:55.527 --> 29:58.364
-Get out of her way, Xander.
-(Groans)

30:02.634 --> 30:06.005
This is getting to be
a pattern with you, Buffy.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.074
Are there
any friends of yours left
you haven't tried to kill?

30:15.814 --> 30:18.984
Come on, Buffy.
Don't you have
a clever retort for me?

30:26.925 --> 30:29.528
(Anya Yelling)

30:49.681 --> 30:53.219
-Anya, I'm sorry.
-You're apologizing to me?

30:54.752 --> 30:57.189
What fight are you watching?

30:57.222 --> 31:00.659
Or is this like one of your
little pop culture references
I don't get...

31:00.692 --> 31:03.261
'cause I'm a vengeance--

31:03.295 --> 31:06.065
(Moans)

31:15.606 --> 31:17.742
(Murmurs)

31:17.776 --> 31:19.744
I just want...

31:19.778 --> 31:23.115
happy... ending.

31:25.116 --> 31:27.385
Honey.

31:27.419 --> 31:31.557
Honey.
What? I'm awake.

31:31.589 --> 31:33.724
I'm okay.

31:33.759 --> 31:37.695
Honey, was-was that weird--

31:37.729 --> 31:40.632
that thing earlier
with the singing...

31:40.665 --> 31:42.601
and the coconuts?

31:42.634 --> 31:45.037
What?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.806
No. It's fine.

31:47.838 --> 31:50.442
MAN AND WOMAN:
* Oh, no

31:50.476 --> 31:53.545
MAN:
* Mustard on my shirt
WOMAN: * Mustard

31:53.578 --> 31:56.315
* I'll never get it out
 * My favorite dress shirt

31:56.347 --> 31:59.250
* Dry-clean it
 * How could you serve

31:59.285 --> 32:02.253
(Together)
* Mustard
(Sighs)

32:02.288 --> 32:03.955
Are you still hungry?
Because I'd be--

32:10.828 --> 32:13.798
* Mr. Xander Harris

32:13.832 --> 32:16.067
* That's what he is
to the world outside *

32:16.102 --> 32:20.806
* That's the name
he carries with pride *

32:20.838 --> 32:22.907
* I'm just lately Anya

32:22.941 --> 32:26.112
* Not very much to the world
I know *

32:26.144 --> 32:31.282
* All these years
with nothing to show *

32:31.317 --> 32:33.585
* I've boned a troll
I've wreaked some wrath *

32:33.618 --> 32:36.087
* But on the whole
I've had no path *

32:36.122 --> 32:38.089
* I like to bowl
I'm good with math *

32:38.124 --> 32:40.125
* But who am I

32:40.159 --> 32:43.128
* Now I reply

32:43.162 --> 32:49.101
* That I'm the missus

32:49.134 --> 32:53.538
* I will be his Mrs.

32:53.572 --> 32:58.477
* Mrs. Anya Christina
Emmanuella Jenkins Harris *

33:04.715 --> 33:07.318
* What's the point of loving

33:07.353 --> 33:10.056
* I mean
except for the sweaty part *

33:10.088 --> 33:14.960
* What's the point
of losing your heart *

33:14.992 --> 33:17.229
* Maybe if you're lucky

33:17.262 --> 33:19.631
* Being a pair
makes you twice as tall *

33:19.664 --> 33:24.403
* Maybe you're not losing
at all *

33:24.435 --> 33:26.971
* No need to cover up my heart

33:27.005 --> 33:29.575
* Plus see above
re sweaty part *

33:29.607 --> 33:33.912
* So maybe love is pretty smart
Then so am I *

33:33.944 --> 33:37.249
* I found my guy

33:37.282 --> 33:42.554
* And I'll be Mrs.

33:42.587 --> 33:47.025
* I will be his missus

33:47.058 --> 33:52.364
* Mrs. Anya "Lame-Ass Made-Up
Maiden Name" Harris *

33:53.565 --> 33:55.901
* We'll never part

33:55.933 --> 33:57.903
* Not if we can

33:57.935 --> 34:00.905
* And if we start

34:00.939 --> 34:03.040
* Then here's my plan

34:03.075 --> 34:05.676
* I'll show him
what bliss is *

34:05.711 --> 34:08.114
* Welcome him with kisses

34:08.146 --> 34:12.050
* 'Cause this is a missus
who misses her man *

34:12.083 --> 34:15.121
* He's my Xander
and he's awfully swell *

34:15.152 --> 34:17.556
* It makes financial sense
as well *

34:17.588 --> 34:19.858
* Although he can be--
I'll never tell *

34:19.891 --> 34:22.427
* Just stand aside

34:22.460 --> 34:25.463
* Here comes the bride

34:25.496 --> 34:31.068
* I'll be Mrs.

34:31.103 --> 34:35.574
* I will be his missus

34:35.606 --> 34:39.445
* I will be--*

34:44.081 --> 34:47.985
(Exhales)
Anya.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.789
(Gasps)

34:58.929 --> 35:00.766
(Sighs)

35:03.135 --> 35:06.572
I'd forgotten how much
swords through the chest hurt.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.574
(Yells)

35:08.606 --> 35:12.344
(Gasps, Exhales)

35:15.447 --> 35:17.815
You know better than that,
Buffy.

35:19.684 --> 35:22.086
Takes a lot more
to kill a vengeance demon.

35:22.119 --> 35:25.123
Oh, I'm just getting started.

35:45.043 --> 35:47.346
Stop trying
to save me, Xander!

35:50.849 --> 35:53.552
(Door Slams)

35:53.585 --> 35:56.788
Oh, please, don't mind me.
Continue with whatever it was
you were doing.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.324
(Sighs, Out Of Breath)

36:02.661 --> 36:06.297
Oh! Breathtaking.

36:06.331 --> 36:10.202
It's like somebody slaughtered
an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog.

36:10.235 --> 36:13.771
Easy now. I'd be gone
before you could swing.

36:15.907 --> 36:19.043
Isn't that
just like a Slayer?

36:19.077 --> 36:22.713
Solving all her problems
by sticking things
with sharp objects.

36:25.217 --> 36:28.420
I talked to your friend,
Ms. Rosenberg.

36:28.454 --> 36:30.922
She's a firebrand.
I have high hopes for her.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.259
Stay away from Willow.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.393
Oh, he's gallant,
isn't he?

36:35.427 --> 36:38.195
I understand
what you saw in him.

36:38.230 --> 36:43.201
Ms. Rosenberg seems to think
Anyanka would be better-suited
outside the vengeance fold.

36:43.235 --> 36:47.672
I think we already know
what Lady "Hacks Away" wants.

36:47.706 --> 36:51.376
And the young man, well,
he sees with the eyeballs
of love.

36:51.409 --> 36:56.614
But I'm not sure if anyone's
bothered to find out what
Anyanka herself really wants.

36:56.648 --> 37:00.918
Her name is Anya.
Actually, a funny
historical sidebar.

37:00.952 --> 37:03.389
Her original name was--
ANYA:
I wanna take it back.

37:04.956 --> 37:08.427
I'm sorry.
What was that?

37:08.460 --> 37:10.496
(Crying)
I wanna take it back.

37:12.963 --> 37:14.733
I want to undo
what I did.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.670
Hmm.
You want to take it back.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.074
Must be 12 bodies in there.

37:23.108 --> 37:27.646
Such a thing--
not easily done...

37:27.679 --> 37:30.282
but not impossible.

37:30.315 --> 37:33.318
You're a big girl, Anyanka.
You understand how this works.

37:33.351 --> 37:36.588
The proverbial scales
must balance.

37:36.621 --> 37:41.327
In order to restore
the lives of the victims,
the fates require a sacrifice--

37:41.360 --> 37:43.994
the life and soul
of a vengeance demon.

37:46.532 --> 37:49.134
-(Breath Quavers)
Do it.
-Wait!

37:49.166 --> 37:52.838
-Stay out of this, Xander.
-Okay, right.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.806
That seems smart.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.775
He just said you have to die.

37:57.809 --> 38:00.144
Perhaps there's some sort of...
alternate price.

38:00.177 --> 38:03.481
Xander,
you can't help me.

38:06.717 --> 38:10.021
I'm not even sure
there's a me to help.

38:13.324 --> 38:16.961
I understand the price.
Do it.

38:16.994 --> 38:20.331
You're sure?
This is your wish?

38:22.067 --> 38:24.001
This is my wish.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.472
Undo what I did.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.643
Very well.
(Clap)

38:31.677 --> 38:35.045
-No!
-(Energy Burst)

38:38.315 --> 38:41.318
Anya.

38:41.353 --> 38:45.023
-Hallie?
-(Screams)

38:50.829 --> 38:52.664
(Gasps)

38:54.365 --> 38:56.802
Who did you think
you were dealing with?

38:56.835 --> 38:59.405
Did you think it would be
that easy to get away?
Why?

38:59.438 --> 39:02.340
Why?
(Laughs)
Because you wished it!

39:02.373 --> 39:06.177
But she was yours.
The way you were mine?

39:06.210 --> 39:08.746
Haven't I taught you
anything, Anya?

39:08.780 --> 39:12.349
Never go for the kill
when you can go for the pain.

39:12.384 --> 39:16.186
Hold him back, Slayer.
Wouldn't want anyone
to get hurt.

39:16.221 --> 39:18.757
I've got plenty of girls.

39:18.789 --> 39:21.358
There will always
be vengeance demons,

39:21.393 --> 39:24.829
but now you, Anya,
you're out.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.833
Congratulations.
Your wish is granted.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.367
You should have killed me.
(Scoffs)

39:30.402 --> 39:33.137
(Chuckling)
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.608
From beneath you,
it devours.

39:36.641 --> 39:40.945
Be patient.
All good things in time.

39:59.097 --> 40:02.266
(Door Opens, Closes)
Go. I'll check
on the boys.

40:02.300 --> 40:06.070
(Frat Boys
Chattering)

40:10.942 --> 40:13.778
Anya, wait.

40:13.811 --> 40:15.947
Xander, please,
just go away.

40:17.949 --> 40:20.952
Whatever's between us,
it doesn't matter.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.021
You shouldn't
be alone in this.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.460
Yes, I should.

40:30.695 --> 40:33.931
My whole life--
(Exhales)

40:33.965 --> 40:36.635
I've just clung
to whatever came along.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.438
Well, speaking as a "clingee,"
I kinda didn't mind.

40:46.210 --> 40:49.179
Thanks... for everything.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.157
(Sighs)

41:07.798 --> 41:10.001
Xander.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.807
What if I'm really nobody?

41:18.677 --> 41:20.512
Don't be a dope.

41:22.347 --> 41:24.849
I'm a dope.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.554
Sometimes.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.190
Well, that's a start.

41:34.224 --> 41:36.327
(Sighs)

41:47.739 --> 41:49.675
(Sniffling)

42:20.606 --> 42:24.309
(Theme music playing)

42:40.391 --> 42:42.226
Grr! Arrgh!
