any crime in the Colony.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.905
Nothing real, at least.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.951

the party line.

- I'm sorry, but

15:56.825 --> 15:58.958
who's he?

15:59.001 --> 16:00.176
- My handler.

16:05.138 --> 16:09.881
- And he's got
a few questions for you.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.629
- If something valuable were
to be stolen in this Colony,

16:18.673 --> 16:20.153
who would investigate?

16:25.723 --> 16:29.597
Art, jewelry,
that sort of thing?

16:29.640 --> 16:31.773

that might have belonged

16:31.816 --> 16:33.775

anything about that.

stuff like that.

Plainclothes.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.022

17:03.065 --> 17:05.154

contact with them.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.069

supposed to acknowledge

17:07.113 --> 17:08.244
that they exist.

17:10.333 --> 17:14.816

reports on these calls?

17:14.859 --> 17:17.601

about a week ago.

that it was a carjacking.
