00:01.333 --> 00:02.801
¶ La-la, la-la-la ¶

00:02.802 --> 00:04.703
I don't think I've ever
seen you so happy.

00:04.704 --> 00:06.772
Me, neither. Which is
a really sad commentary

00:06.773 --> 00:08.273
on Hilda's life.

00:08.274 --> 00:09.807
Hilda always gets
this excited

00:09.808 --> 00:11.076
when she's gonna
see our cousin

00:11.077 --> 00:12.244
Zsa Zsa Goowhiggie.

00:12.245 --> 00:13.278
Gesundheit.

00:13.279 --> 00:15.113
She's my favorite relative.

00:15.114 --> 00:16.379
She's a great
practical joker.

00:16.381 --> 00:18.049
Tons of fun.

00:18.050 --> 00:19.151
If you call putting
killer bees

00:19.152 --> 00:20.719
in someone's
bonnet "fun."

00:20.720 --> 00:22.987
Oh, well, maybe you were
too swollen to laugh.

00:22.988 --> 00:24.355
Well, I'm gonna
say my hellos

00:24.356 --> 00:26.791
and then get back to work
on my subatomic microphone.

00:26.792 --> 00:28.693
Are you still trying to prove
electrons can hear?

00:28.694 --> 00:30.061
Don't laugh.

00:30.062 --> 00:32.097
Because they might
hear me?

00:32.098 --> 00:34.198
And you, instead of fooling
around with Zsa Zsa,

00:34.199 --> 00:36.033
you should be
practicing your violin.

00:36.034 --> 00:38.169
You've got an
audition in two days.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.771
Which is two days <i>away.</i>

00:40.873 --> 00:42.173
( hissing )

00:42.174 --> 00:43.541
( screams )

00:43.542 --> 00:44.476
( body thuds )

00:44.477 --> 00:46.277
Oh!

00:46.278 --> 00:49.080
This is vintage
Zsa Zsa!

00:49.081 --> 00:50.047
Okay, Zsa Zsa,

00:50.048 --> 00:52.083
you can morph into
your human form now.

00:52.084 --> 00:52.983
Gotcha!

00:54.987 --> 00:55.987
( screams )

00:57.423 --> 00:59.157
So..."Goowhiggie."

00:59.158 --> 01:00.491
Is that Swedish?

01:05.597 --> 01:07.565

Advertise your product or brand here

01:19.178 --> 01:21.246
Other leprechauns look up to me.

01:25.817 --> 01:27.752
Ah. There you go.

01:27.753 --> 01:29.287
When did you start
selling cosmetics?

01:29.288 --> 01:30.722
When the trust fund
dried up.

01:30.723 --> 01:31.756
Oh!

01:31.757 --> 01:33.525
Here is the latest
beauty product

01:33.526 --> 01:35.025
from the Other Realm.

01:35.026 --> 01:36.561
"Instant Hobo?"

01:36.562 --> 01:38.563
What, when the jar's empty,
you can live in it?

01:38.564 --> 01:39.764
( all chuckle )

01:39.765 --> 01:42.066
I think I'm getting bags
under my eyes.

01:44.036 --> 01:45.336
Okay, you all missed
your cue to say:

01:45.337 --> 01:46.837
"No, Salem, you look fine."

01:46.838 --> 01:49.374
That means I need
some concealer.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.509
Salem, I'd love to
sell you some products,

01:51.510 --> 01:54.011
but your name's all over
the bad-check list.

01:54.012 --> 01:55.480
What about my aliases?

01:55.481 --> 01:57.214
They're gonna have
baggy eyes too.

01:57.215 --> 01:59.016
( sobbing )

01:59.017 --> 02:00.618
Zelda...

02:00.619 --> 02:02.387
this color
could be for you.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.288
Oh?

02:03.289 --> 02:04.622
Oh! Oh!

02:04.623 --> 02:06.290
( both laughing, clapping )

02:06.291 --> 02:07.925
You know,
they must miss you two

02:07.926 --> 02:09.259
at the Algonquin.

02:09.261 --> 02:10.360
Whoo.

02:10.362 --> 02:11.996
Well, I'd love to
stick around and wonder

02:11.997 --> 02:13.198
what you two
have been drinking,

02:13.199 --> 02:14.232
but I got to
get to school.

02:14.233 --> 02:15.500
Oh, Sabrina.

02:15.501 --> 02:17.702
Sabrina, please,
try this blush.

02:17.703 --> 02:19.003
I wonder what's gonna
pop out of here

02:19.004 --> 02:20.772
and cause you two
to laugh uncontrollably.

02:21.773 --> 02:22.907
Hm.

02:24.009 --> 02:25.710
Hey. Nice color.

02:26.845 --> 02:27.978
ZSA ZSA:
Uh-huh.

02:27.979 --> 02:28.880
Not bad.

02:28.881 --> 02:30.114
ZSA ZSA:
Young lady.

02:30.115 --> 02:31.349
Thank you, Zsa Zsa.

02:31.350 --> 02:32.850
Oh, you're
welcome.

02:32.851 --> 02:34.318
( chuckles )

02:34.319 --> 02:35.553
Bye-bye.

02:37.189 --> 02:38.222
( door closes )

02:38.223 --> 02:39.724
( both cackle )

02:41.427 --> 02:43.228
Hey, Sabrina.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.396
Ooh. Did you enroll
in clown college?

02:46.699 --> 02:47.765
( gasps )

02:47.766 --> 02:49.667
Zsa Zsa.

02:49.668 --> 02:51.502
Harvest season at
my aunts' vineyard.

02:51.503 --> 02:53.438
So, um, did you
sign up

02:53.439 --> 02:55.039
to take any college-
prep classes?

02:55.040 --> 02:57.442
Oh, I decided I'm
not taking the SATs.

02:57.443 --> 02:58.510
I'm gonna be
a mechanic,

02:58.511 --> 03:00.778
so...I'm not
going to college.

03:00.779 --> 03:01.980
Really?

03:01.981 --> 03:03.415
No college?

03:03.416 --> 03:05.650
( <i>tense theme playing</i> )

03:05.651 --> 03:06.984
What a day.

03:06.985 --> 03:08.953
Who would've thought
an executive vice president

03:08.954 --> 03:10.422
would have so much
to do?

03:10.423 --> 03:11.823
Drive!

03:11.824 --> 03:13.658
So what if your engine's
on fire.

03:13.659 --> 03:15.293
What are you, a girl?

03:15.294 --> 03:16.460
Harvey, I'm home.

03:16.461 --> 03:17.895
Oh, hey, honey.

03:19.030 --> 03:20.498
Did you see
the new car?

03:20.499 --> 03:23.267
Yeah, it looks like it's
up on new blocks too.

03:23.268 --> 03:25.169
And as soon as I find
an engine and some tires,

03:25.170 --> 03:27.405
I'm taking my girl for a ride.

03:30.075 --> 03:31.109
( <i>tires squeal on TV</i> )

03:31.110 --> 03:32.410
Oh, it's getting
exciting.

03:34.313 --> 03:35.447
( bell rings )

03:36.749 --> 03:38.249
See you after class.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.418
Wait, so you're really
not gonna go to college?

03:40.419 --> 03:41.853
Nope.

03:41.854 --> 03:43.955
Not even clown college?

03:43.956 --> 03:45.056
( Salem humming )

03:46.758 --> 03:49.894
Aha. The concealer at last.

03:49.895 --> 03:52.330
Mm. That cherry lipstick
looks delicious.

03:52.331 --> 03:53.431
No.

03:53.432 --> 03:56.100
Beautify now, eat later.

03:56.101 --> 03:57.235
Do you think
I should be worried

03:57.236 --> 03:59.103
that Harvey isn't
going to college?

03:59.104 --> 04:00.471
I didn't go
to college.

04:00.472 --> 04:02.206
Aw, he's doomed,
I tell you. Doomed!

04:03.476 --> 04:05.110
Oh, I can't imagine
what it would feel like

04:05.111 --> 04:08.212
to have no drive,
so little ambition.

04:08.213 --> 04:10.014
Not that that's
a bad thing.

04:10.015 --> 04:11.516
And I can't imagine
what it would be like

04:11.517 --> 04:13.918
to be so driven, you
never had time for fun.

04:13.919 --> 04:15.853
I have fun.

04:15.854 --> 04:17.555
Working nonstop
to achieve a goal

04:17.555 --> 04:19.690
is enormously
pleasurable.

04:19.690 --> 04:21.024
Oh, that's right.
They have that new

04:21.026 --> 04:23.928
all-work ride
at Disney World.

04:23.929 --> 04:25.563
May I offer
a suggestion?

04:26.799 --> 04:28.666
Walk-a-mile
moccasins.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.035
You each buy a pair
and then switch.

04:31.036 --> 04:33.838
They help you understand
how the other person feels.

04:33.839 --> 04:36.107
Couldn't we just have
extensive family therapy?

04:36.108 --> 04:37.875
Maybe we should
try them, Hilda.
Hm.

04:37.876 --> 04:40.344
It's only a mile
and...they're pink.

04:40.345 --> 04:42.380
Well. I can see why
you'd want to be like me,

04:42.381 --> 04:44.281
but why would I want
to be like you?

04:44.282 --> 04:45.816
All right.

04:45.817 --> 04:47.452
Ah, yes.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.488
Now, switch.

04:53.125 --> 04:54.425
SALEM:
Say, everyone,

04:54.426 --> 04:57.328
are there still bags
under my eyes?

04:57.329 --> 04:58.663
Salem, where
are you?

04:58.664 --> 05:00.798
I'm right here,
in front--

05:00.799 --> 05:02.633
Oh, dear lord!

05:02.634 --> 05:04.602
I used too much concealer!

05:04.603 --> 05:06.271
I'm invisible.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.006
And in debt.
But on the bright side,

05:08.007 --> 05:09.574
you really can't
see those bags.

05:09.575 --> 05:10.875
( Salem sobbing )

05:14.246 --> 05:15.846
( knocking )

05:15.847 --> 05:17.281
Knock, knock.

05:17.282 --> 05:19.650
Oh, hi, Zsa Zsa. I don't have
any time for any pranks,

05:19.651 --> 05:20.851
so just leave the joy buzzer,

05:20.852 --> 05:22.320
and I'll shock myself
with it later.

05:23.488 --> 05:24.789
This is business, honey.

05:24.790 --> 05:27.891
Now, I overheard about
your little friend, Harvey,

05:27.892 --> 05:29.594
and I've got
the perfect product.

05:31.263 --> 05:32.530
"Pure Ambition?"

05:32.531 --> 05:33.598
It's a cologne.

05:33.599 --> 05:35.867
A little dab, and your man
will be more ambitious

05:35.868 --> 05:38.703
than the entire William Morris
mailroom put together.

05:38.704 --> 05:40.505
Whoa. It's a little musky.

05:40.506 --> 05:41.472
Well, they do say

05:41.473 --> 05:43.841
that success
is 99 percent perspiration.

05:43.842 --> 05:45.209
Gross.

05:45.210 --> 05:47.678
I'll take it.
Put it on my aunts' tab.

05:47.679 --> 05:48.979
I'm telling you, man,

05:48.980 --> 05:50.448
this East German
transmission

05:50.449 --> 05:51.548
is driving me crazy.

05:51.549 --> 05:52.817
I figure it's
either a valve,

05:52.818 --> 05:54.952
or they're plotting to
take over the world again.

05:54.953 --> 05:57.288
Harvey! I got you
a present.

05:57.289 --> 05:58.389
What for?

05:58.390 --> 05:59.757
Boyfriend's
Day.

05:59.758 --> 06:01.425
Uh, it's a...
holiday

06:01.426 --> 06:03.060
that the retailers
came up with

06:03.061 --> 06:04.429
to fill in the slow
sale season

06:04.430 --> 06:05.630
between Christmas
and Easter.

06:05.631 --> 06:06.764
Just put it on.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.402
Oh, it smells like
my dog

06:10.403 --> 06:12.603
when he's rolled in
something dead.

06:14.039 --> 06:16.341
But I like it.

06:16.342 --> 06:17.841
( magical chime )

06:17.842 --> 06:19.978
Hey, after I replace
that valve,

06:19.979 --> 06:22.180
I think I'm gonna
overhaul the whole engine.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.248
You're not talking
about SATs, are you?

06:24.249 --> 06:26.383
Come on, man,
we can fix this car.

06:26.384 --> 06:28.453
We just need to be
a little more ambitious.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.321
But after you fix the car,
you're gonna drive it

06:30.322 --> 06:32.156
to a college-recruitment
center, right?

06:32.157 --> 06:33.925
Right?

06:33.926 --> 06:35.660
Oh. I guess a little dab
didn't do him.

06:37.062 --> 06:39.130
We've been wearing these
moccasins for a while now,

06:39.131 --> 06:40.398
and I don't feel
any different.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.932
Do you?
No.

06:41.933 --> 06:44.835
Although I do have
a sudden urge to track bear.

06:44.836 --> 06:46.104
Hey, Hildy.

06:46.105 --> 06:47.839
Wanna fill up all the holes
on the golf course?

06:47.840 --> 06:50.141
No, thanks. I'm going
to practice my violin.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.579
And I have
research to do.

06:55.881 --> 06:57.181
Although...

06:57.182 --> 06:59.317
golf course high jinks
sound like fun.

07:03.221 --> 07:04.154
Hey! Hey! Aw. Whoo!

07:05.925 --> 07:07.458
Oh, the smell!

07:07.459 --> 07:08.993
Ugh. It's not
that bad, is it?

07:08.994 --> 07:10.361
Oh!

07:10.362 --> 07:11.662
Where are you going?

07:11.663 --> 07:12.863
To bathe.

07:12.864 --> 07:15.032
( magical chime )

07:15.033 --> 07:17.501
And to take the practice
SAT Test.

07:17.502 --> 07:19.002
Ah.

07:19.003 --> 07:22.206
The sweet stench of success.

07:22.207 --> 07:23.941
( clears throat )
Um, hello?

07:23.942 --> 07:26.177
Do you have Prince
Albert in a can?

07:27.679 --> 07:29.947
Oh, I think you do.

07:29.948 --> 07:31.182
( magical whoosh )

07:35.520 --> 07:37.154
( English accent ):
Excuse me, shopkeeper,

07:37.155 --> 07:38.456
do be a sport

07:38.457 --> 07:40.458
and let me out of here,
would you?

07:40.459 --> 07:42.393
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )
( gasps )

07:45.130 --> 07:47.131
( both laughing )

07:47.132 --> 07:49.233
Oh. Didn't you say
that somebody was coming over

07:49.234 --> 07:51.001
from the grant committee
for a presentation?

07:51.002 --> 07:53.137
Oh. Oh, that's right.

07:53.138 --> 07:54.905
And I've got to get
right to work.

07:54.906 --> 07:56.440
Mm-hm.
Just one more call.

07:56.441 --> 07:57.675
One more.
( giggles )

08:00.211 --> 08:02.012
Salem?

08:02.013 --> 08:03.748
SALEM ( disguising voice ):
Salem's not here.

08:03.749 --> 08:05.849
Oh, well, then he won't
want me to open

08:05.850 --> 08:07.951
any of those cans
for him.

08:07.952 --> 08:09.153
SALEM ( disguising voice ):
Oh.

08:09.154 --> 08:10.521
Wait, here he is now.

08:10.522 --> 08:13.057
Salem, how about some of
that sockeye?

08:13.058 --> 08:14.525
( normal voice ):
Love some.

08:14.526 --> 08:15.393
( laughing )

08:16.595 --> 08:17.962
Hey, bright boy.

08:17.963 --> 08:19.029
You might be invisible,

08:19.030 --> 08:20.698
but these cans aren't.

08:20.699 --> 08:22.633
Put these away.

Party pooper.

08:23.969 --> 08:25.936
And put that tongue
back in your mouth.

08:27.239 --> 08:29.340
Don't you have
some research to do?

08:29.341 --> 08:31.342
Hildy...your nose
is running.

08:31.343 --> 08:32.376
No, it isn't.

08:32.376 --> 08:34.278
Yes, it is.
Uh-huh.

08:34.279 --> 08:36.013
( gasps )
Oh.

08:36.014 --> 08:38.215
( <i>upbeat theme playing</i> )

08:38.216 --> 08:40.650
I'm just glad I don't
play a wind instrument.

08:40.652 --> 08:42.385

08:44.089 --> 08:46.257
( both cackling )

08:46.258 --> 08:47.624
( bell rings )

08:48.861 --> 08:50.294
So you seem to be
working hard.

08:50.295 --> 08:51.395
How do you think
you did?

08:51.396 --> 08:53.364
Oh. I forgot about the test.

08:53.365 --> 08:55.600
I was drawing up my design
for the new race car

08:55.601 --> 08:56.734
I'm gonna build.

08:56.735 --> 08:58.569
It's completely aerodynamic,

08:58.570 --> 09:00.738
and it has 17 cup holders.

09:02.107 --> 09:04.208
Ah. I'm gonna get Zsa Zsa
right in the Goowhiggie.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.276
( spraying )

09:08.747 --> 09:10.381
That Ambition cologne
only made Harvey

09:10.382 --> 09:11.882
more ambitious
towards cars

09:11.883 --> 09:14.051
and beverage
caddies.

09:14.052 --> 09:15.987
Well, Harvey's ambition
needs to expand

09:15.988 --> 09:18.422
beyond his usual horizons.

09:18.423 --> 09:20.091
The cologne may
not be enough.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.926
I'm not buying
any more stuff.

09:21.927 --> 09:24.762
Well, I'm not sure I have
anything that's appropriate.

09:24.763 --> 09:26.964
Although, I did sell
the Ambition deodorant

09:26.965 --> 09:27.965
to Bill Gates.

09:27.966 --> 09:29.433
But it's not for Harvey.

09:29.434 --> 09:30.735
Bill Gates?
Mm-hm.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.635
And Michael Eisner,

09:31.636 --> 09:34.238
he swears by Ambition shampoo.

09:34.239 --> 09:35.940
But it's not for Harvey.

09:35.941 --> 09:37.341
Oh, and he wouldn't
be interested

09:37.342 --> 09:38.976
in the Ambition after-shave.

09:38.977 --> 09:41.245
I'll take it. I'll take the
whole line of Ambition products.

09:41.246 --> 09:42.647
Wonderful.

09:43.815 --> 09:45.015
And with your $40 purchase,

09:45.016 --> 09:48.219
you'll receive
this lovely tote bag.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.054
Forty dollars?
Forty dollars.

09:50.055 --> 09:51.489
Put it on my aunts' tab.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.458
( chuckles )

09:53.459 --> 09:54.859
Whoo!

09:56.128 --> 09:57.995
Ambition is a good product.

09:57.996 --> 10:00.264
Almost as good
as my favorite perfume...

Reverse Psychology.

10:02.067 --> 10:03.300

products are heavy.

Oh, I love these free rides.

10:13.211 --> 10:15.313
Although, I could've done
without your stopover

10:15.314 --> 10:17.081
in the bathroom.

10:17.082 --> 10:20.050
Harvey will never put
these products on willingly.

10:20.051 --> 10:21.786
Just gonna have to do it
the hard way.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.256

Oh, hey.

11:18.577 --> 11:20.043
I'm so glad
to see you.

11:20.044 --> 11:21.945
I just came to
an incredible decision.

11:21.946 --> 11:25.182
I'm gonna do everything I can
to achieve my full potential.

11:25.183 --> 11:26.884
Oh, that's great.

11:26.885 --> 11:29.820
And you're starting out by
clearing out your locker?

11:29.821 --> 11:31.088
I'm starting...

11:31.089 --> 11:32.957
by dropping out of school.

11:34.592 --> 11:37.260
That's not gonna look good
on your college application.

11:40.599 --> 11:42.799
Hey, so...why are you
dropping out of school?

11:42.800 --> 11:43.835
To be a mechanic?

11:43.836 --> 11:45.336
Of course not.
I'm gonna pool

11:45.337 --> 11:47.205
my lawn-mowing and paper-
route money together

11:47.206 --> 11:48.805
and put a down payment
on a garage.

11:48.806 --> 11:50.941
I'm gonna be
an owner-operator.

11:50.942 --> 11:53.344
Great. So was
Goober Pyle.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.014
I am here to interview
Zelda Spellman

11:57.015 --> 11:58.449
regarding her
grant proposal.

11:58.450 --> 11:59.517
I'll go get her.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.685
Zelda is a terrific
researcher.

12:01.686 --> 12:03.787
Very hardworking,
dedicated, professional--

Zelda.

12:06.591 --> 12:08.125
Zelda!

12:08.126 --> 12:10.227
This is
Boris Lermontov.

12:10.228 --> 12:12.396
The head of
the grant committee.

12:12.397 --> 12:13.864
Oh, Mr. Lermontov.

12:13.865 --> 12:14.966
Uh, please, sit down.

12:17.202 --> 12:18.469
All the way down.

12:18.470 --> 12:19.737
Oh.

12:19.738 --> 12:20.637
( both laughing )

12:20.638 --> 12:22.173
I can't find my spectacles.

12:23.108 --> 12:24.308
Whoo!

12:24.309 --> 12:26.811
Here they are.
I'm sorry.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.645
The house
isn't level.

12:28.646 --> 12:32.116
I suppose you find time
to do actual research

12:32.117 --> 12:34.251
between guffaws.

12:34.252 --> 12:35.786
I'm sorry.

12:35.787 --> 12:38.022
I would like to get
serious and discuss

12:38.023 --> 12:39.590
my latest endeavor:
Mm-hm.

12:39.591 --> 12:40.857
the Wedgie Project.

12:40.858 --> 12:42.426
Aah!

12:42.427 --> 12:43.827
( laughing )

12:45.998 --> 12:48.332
So it did make
the boy ambitious.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.601
If you consider forgoing
a high school diploma

12:50.602 --> 12:53.237
to spend time with leaky
carburetors ambitious.

12:53.238 --> 12:54.505
And I do.

12:54.506 --> 12:56.640
Just tell me how to
reverse the effect.

12:56.641 --> 12:58.776
Sorry. Once Ambition
has been applied,

12:58.777 --> 13:00.744
you have to let it
run its course.

13:00.745 --> 13:02.313
Great. Well, this is

13:02.314 --> 13:04.015
as ambitious
as he'll get, right?

13:04.016 --> 13:05.215
Should be.

13:05.216 --> 13:06.984
You just used a little,
didn't you?

13:08.086 --> 13:09.553
( doorbell rings )

13:13.325 --> 13:14.725
Harvey?

13:14.726 --> 13:17.094
Let me guess: you haven't been
working on cars, have you?

13:17.095 --> 13:19.229
No. And I've
got great news.

13:19.230 --> 13:21.265
Instead of going to
the bank for a loan,

13:21.266 --> 13:24.168
I got on the internet and used
my savings to buy yen,

13:24.169 --> 13:25.636
which I converted
into German marks,

13:25.637 --> 13:27.371
and then put the whole
thing on pork bellies.

13:27.372 --> 13:31.275
And when I left home,
I was up $11 million.

13:31.276 --> 13:33.143
'Course,
it's all on paper.

13:33.144 --> 13:34.145
Eleven million dollars?

13:34.146 --> 13:36.146
Think of the college
you could afford.

13:36.147 --> 13:37.247
Good idea.

13:39.084 --> 13:40.952
Maybe I'll buy one.

called.

getting that grant.

joining the Vienna Boys' Choir.

Tell the mayor
I can't make his fundraiser,

14:15.720 --> 14:17.221
but tell the governor
I can make his.

Now, I want you--

14:18.256 --> 14:19.623
Harvey, what's
going on?

14:19.624 --> 14:21.559
Excuse me, ma'am. But you
can't talk to Mr. Kinkle

without
an appointment.

14:22.761 --> 14:25.228
It's okay. I've got
30 seconds free,

14:25.229 --> 14:26.697
if we keep walking.

14:26.698 --> 14:28.932
Well, it's good to see
you're back in school.

14:28.933 --> 14:31.468
Yep. I'm here to see how much
it will cost to knock it down.

14:31.469 --> 14:32.803
What?!

14:32.804 --> 14:34.505
I'm gonna need
a headquarters for my empire,

so I'm gonna raze
the entire block

But you can't.

and a retirement home

have something to do

don't like all this,

why don't they just
move to the country?

the country.

You should see what
you've done to the city.

17:10.394 --> 17:12.195
( funky music playing )

17:13.464 --> 17:15.566
Let me guess,
my birthday party?

17:15.567 --> 17:17.768
No. Your funeral.

17:17.769 --> 17:19.102
( cheering, champagne
cork pops )

17:20.739 --> 17:22.605
Everyone is glad
you're dead.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.340
Because you and your
boundless ambition

17:24.342 --> 17:25.709
have systematically
wiped out

17:25.710 --> 17:27.911
all that is good and
right with the world.

17:27.912 --> 17:29.012
Wow.

17:29.013 --> 17:30.747
Something to
think about, huh?

17:32.083 --> 17:35.986
So...now that you've
seen your future,

17:35.987 --> 17:38.321
Brain freeze is something
you bring on yourself.

17:38.322 --> 17:39.456
I guess I went
a little haywire

17:39.457 --> 17:41.792
when we bet on who could drink
a Polar Freeze the fastest.

17:41.793 --> 17:42.959
( groans )

17:42.960 --> 17:44.094
Well, if it's
any consolation

17:44.095 --> 17:46.329
at this difficult time,
you lost.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.530
So according to our deal,

17:47.531 --> 17:50.800
you owe me
one giant surprise gift.

17:50.801 --> 17:52.035
( door opens )

17:52.036 --> 17:54.104
Kinkle, Spellman.

17:54.105 --> 17:55.639
( shrieks )
( gasps )

17:55.640 --> 17:58.675
Is Mr. Kraft still dating
your aunt Zelda?

17:58.676 --> 18:00.977
No. See?
I'm in denial about it.

18:00.978 --> 18:01.978
You better go.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.448
Hey, kids.

18:04.449 --> 18:06.149
We were just getting ready
to watch a video.

18:06.150 --> 18:07.284
Why don't you
join us?

18:07.285 --> 18:08.652
That is, if you think
you can handle

18:08.653 --> 18:10.053
the bittersweet
anarchy

18:10.054 --> 18:12.221
of <i>Billy Jack Goes</i>
<i>to Washington.</i>

18:12.222 --> 18:13.357
Cool... Ooh!

18:13.358 --> 18:15.825
Oh, brain freeze.
I better get him home.

18:19.531 --> 18:21.465
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

18:33.077 --> 18:35.178
<i>Baywatch:</i> <i>The Early Years.</i>

18:35.179 --> 18:36.112
( squeaks )

18:39.817 --> 18:41.618
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

18:44.322 --> 18:45.522
Salem, quit staring at me.

18:45.523 --> 18:46.756
Sorry.

18:46.757 --> 18:48.025
I just can't stop reliving

18:48.026 --> 18:49.492
the disgusting spectacle

18:49.493 --> 18:52.129
I witnessed
at that table last night.

18:52.130 --> 18:55.532
Aunt Hilda told her "I-could-
have-been-a-great-dancer" story?

18:55.533 --> 18:56.967
Worse. Right where
you're sitting,

18:56.968 --> 19:00.170
Zelda was making goo-goo
eyes with the Casanova

19:00.171 --> 19:02.372
of the hall pass,
Willard Kraft.

19:02.373 --> 19:04.240
Ugh! Gross, gross, gross,
gross, gross.

19:04.241 --> 19:06.943
Think happy thoughts,
like bunnies and flowers.

19:06.944 --> 19:08.479
I'm glad Aunt Zelda's
found a boyfriend,

19:08.480 --> 19:10.080
but couldn't it
have been a mammal?

19:10.081 --> 19:11.981
Personally,
I'm over it.

19:11.982 --> 19:15.185
Oh, sure, I had issues
with my sister dating a man

19:15.186 --> 19:17.287
who's still hopelessly
in love with me,

19:17.288 --> 19:19.055
but then I just decided
to let it go.

19:19.056 --> 19:20.690
I suggest you do the same.

19:20.691 --> 19:22.526
You're right.
It's not like he's moving in.

19:22.527 --> 19:24.094
( both laugh )

19:24.095 --> 19:25.128
( both shriek )

19:26.531 --> 19:27.998
Good morning, ladies.

19:27.999 --> 19:30.200
Where's my zoo-zoo?

19:30.201 --> 19:32.035
ZELDA:
Is that my monkey?

19:32.036 --> 19:35.639
Ugh. Friends don't let
friends talk baby talk.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.573
KRAFT:
There she is.

19:36.574 --> 19:38.442
Ready for your
breakfast <i>gordita?</i>

19:38.443 --> 19:40.510
Ooh.

19:40.511 --> 19:42.846
Ooh, it looks <i>muy bueno.</i>

19:42.847 --> 19:44.881
I'll tell you
what <i>muys</i> my <i>bueno</i>

19:44.882 --> 19:47.183
is when you wear
your hair up like that.

19:47.184 --> 19:49.018
( giggles )
( whistles )

19:49.019 --> 19:50.287
( both smooching )

19:50.288 --> 19:52.155
I will live through this.
I will live through this.

19:52.156 --> 19:53.389
It's not working.

19:53.390 --> 19:56.125
Oh, Sabrina,
I almost forgot,

19:56.126 --> 19:58.128
I can't drive you
to school this morning,

19:58.129 --> 20:02.298
but, luckily, Willard said
he'd be delighted to take you.

20:03.401 --> 20:04.568
Super.

20:07.071 --> 20:08.572
And Sabrina didn't
get brain freeze

20:08.573 --> 20:10.507
because she allows the slush
to sit in her mouth

20:10.508 --> 20:12.609
and reach body temperature
before exposing it

20:12.610 --> 20:13.744
to her soft palette.

20:13.745 --> 20:15.345
You spend entirely
too much time

20:15.346 --> 20:17.214
at frozenslushy.com.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.016
So, what surprise
are you gonna get her?

20:19.017 --> 20:21.118
I thought the biggest surprise
might be no surprise.

20:21.119 --> 20:23.486
So, what you're saying
is you need my help?

20:25.022 --> 20:26.990
( students jeering )

20:30.761 --> 20:33.063
I warned you
to roll up your windows

20:33.064 --> 20:34.131
when we hit school property.

20:34.132 --> 20:35.298
But you didn't say

20:35.299 --> 20:37.434
it was because students
pelt you with garbage.

20:37.435 --> 20:40.102
I thought
that was implied.

20:40.103 --> 20:41.471
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:41.472 --> 20:46.243
these hallways are crying out
for the iron fist of order.

20:47.879 --> 20:50.847
Ugh, I have milk in my ear.

20:50.848 --> 20:53.049
"Nebraska Steaks proudly offers

20:53.050 --> 20:56.186
"a belt-bustin' roundup
of flanks 'n' franks

20:56.187 --> 20:59.957
sure to satisfy even
your most obese relatives."

20:59.958 --> 21:02.092
Ungawa.

21:02.093 --> 21:03.793
Salem...
( yelps )

21:03.794 --> 21:05.295
did we see you playing
with a dog?

21:05.296 --> 21:07.030
Uh, absolutely not.

21:07.031 --> 21:07.998
Hate 'em.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.132
Aha!

21:09.133 --> 21:11.768
There's a trail
of slobber on your back.

21:11.769 --> 21:13.102
It's hair product?

21:13.103 --> 21:14.704
All right.

21:14.705 --> 21:17.073
He answers to "Silky,"
his owner's a butcher,

21:17.074 --> 21:19.675
and I'm letting him
bat me around to get meat.

21:19.676 --> 21:22.445
It's time you look into a little
thing we call "dignity."

21:22.446 --> 21:24.014
And get rid
of that steak catalog.

21:24.015 --> 21:26.349
We know you don't read
the articles.

21:26.350 --> 21:27.985
( laughing ):
Stop.

21:27.986 --> 21:29.785
( giggling )

21:29.786 --> 21:31.788
No. No, Willard.

21:31.789 --> 21:34.324
I'm sure Hilda
and Sabrina won't mind.

21:34.325 --> 21:36.993
Bye, monkey. Heh.

21:38.496 --> 21:40.196
Won't mind what?

21:40.197 --> 21:41.364
Willard's grandmother
is doing

21:41.365 --> 21:43.232
a massive renovation
on her house,

21:43.233 --> 21:45.235
so Willard needs a place
to stay.

21:45.236 --> 21:48.071
I told him he could use
the apartment over the garage.

21:48.072 --> 21:50.573
But we don't have an apartment
over our garage.

21:51.676 --> 21:52.976
( clunk )

21:52.977 --> 21:54.911
We do now.

21:54.912 --> 21:56.746
By the way, I mind a lot!

21:56.747 --> 21:58.848
In fact, I've never minded
anything so much in my life!

21:58.849 --> 22:00.150
Don't you mind?

22:00.151 --> 22:01.284
Nope.

22:01.285 --> 22:04.420
I center on my chi,
and I am free from care.

22:04.421 --> 22:05.688
Well, I'm not.

22:05.689 --> 22:08.391
I'll go mad, I tell you!

22:08.392 --> 22:09.625
Mad!

22:09.626 --> 22:11.261
Hey.
Hey. Any ideas?

22:11.262 --> 22:13.330
Think Sabrina would
like some car mats?

22:13.331 --> 22:14.798
That's not
the greatest gift idea

22:14.799 --> 22:15.932
when you don't have a car.

22:15.933 --> 22:17.834
You know what, it's not
the greatest gift idea

22:17.835 --> 22:19.469
when you do have a car.

22:19.470 --> 22:20.904
Hey!

22:20.905 --> 22:22.606
How 'bout a photo portrait
of the two of you?

22:22.607 --> 22:24.707
But I already bought
the car mats.

22:24.708 --> 22:25.708
Hey, guys, what's up?

22:25.709 --> 22:27.010
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

22:27.011 --> 22:29.746
Oh, good. Valerie's helping
you pick out my gift.

22:29.747 --> 22:31.615
KRAFT ( over PA ):
<i>Attention, students.</i>

22:31.616 --> 22:32.849
<i>This is your vice principal.</i>

22:32.850 --> 22:34.951
<i>A recruiter</i>
<i>from Burger World University</i>

22:34.952 --> 22:36.219
<i>will be meeting today</i>

22:36.220 --> 22:38.321
<i>with any interested</i>
<i>fifth-year seniors,</i>

22:38.322 --> 22:40.724
<i>and, on a personal note</i>
<i>to Sabrina Spellman,</i>

22:40.725 --> 22:42.158
<i>your aunt wants us</i>
<i>to bring home</i>

22:42.159 --> 22:44.060
<i>bread and toilet paper.</i>

22:44.061 --> 22:47.296
Sabrina, is Mr. Kraft living
in your house?

22:47.297 --> 22:49.099
No. He's living
over the garage,

22:49.100 --> 22:51.734
which is further from the house
than most restraining orders.

22:51.735 --> 22:53.069
I'll probably never
see him.

22:54.104 --> 22:55.972
( <i>light rock theme playing</i> )

23:35.980 --> 23:37.681
Salem, I have
a few questions

23:37.682 --> 23:39.582
about carbon monoxide,
garage apartments,

23:39.583 --> 23:41.952
and making something
look like an accident.

23:41.953 --> 23:43.653
( barks )
Beg your pardon?

23:43.654 --> 23:45.922
I said, "What a pity.
Now, roll over."

23:45.923 --> 23:47.056
( scoffs )

23:47.057 --> 23:49.325
Berlitz's <i>How To Speak Dog?</i>

23:49.326 --> 23:51.561
I'm improving myself.

23:51.562 --> 23:53.296
MAN ( on CD ):
<i>Which way to the</i> biblioteca?

23:53.297 --> 23:55.165
( <i>man barks</i> )
Shame on you, Salem.

23:55.166 --> 23:56.532
Silky thinks he's your friend

23:56.533 --> 23:58.568
and you're just using him
for your own pleasure.

23:58.569 --> 24:00.302
I thought that was
the point of dogs.

24:00.303 --> 24:02.304
Besides,
I <i>am</i> helping him.

24:02.305 --> 24:04.908
He'll never manage his owner
until he learns how to beg.

24:04.909 --> 24:08.544
If the result is beefsteak
for the cat, so be it.

24:08.545 --> 24:11.548
Maybe you can train him to chase
Mr. Kraft from the neighborhood.

24:11.549 --> 24:12.916
( barks )

24:12.917 --> 24:14.985
Stop asking me
where the library is.

24:14.986 --> 24:16.919
I'm in crisis here.

24:18.789 --> 24:19.989
I can't take it anymore.

24:19.990 --> 24:21.490
Our house has become
the Smithsonian

24:21.491 --> 24:23.926
of his toenail clippings.

24:23.927 --> 24:25.828
Isn't he driving you crazy?

24:25.829 --> 24:27.096
I have made
a personal choice

24:27.097 --> 24:29.766
not to be affected
by Willard Kraft.

24:29.767 --> 24:31.267
He used your toothbrush.

24:31.268 --> 24:34.336
Deep, cleansing breath.

24:34.337 --> 24:38.241
BOTH:
¶ Love lifts us up
Where we belong ¶

24:38.242 --> 24:41.310
¶ Where the angels fly ¶
¶ Where the eagles fly ¶

24:41.311 --> 24:45.014
BOTH:
¶ On a mountain high ¶

24:45.015 --> 24:46.116
Zelda...

24:46.117 --> 24:48.017
you complete me.

24:48.018 --> 24:49.552
ZELDA:
Oh, you know what?

24:49.553 --> 24:51.387
I'm gonna get my copy
of <i>Love Letters</i>

24:51.388 --> 24:53.055
and we can read them
to each other.

24:53.056 --> 24:54.491
Oh, yes.
Oh!

25:00.197 --> 25:03.366
That is one special lady.

25:03.367 --> 25:05.534
You know, you might want
to start thinking

25:05.535 --> 25:08.271
about calling me
"Uncle Willard."

25:12.376 --> 25:14.544
Well, they're always looking
for nuns, right?

25:14.545 --> 25:16.746
Just breathe
and let it go, Sabrina.

25:16.747 --> 25:19.048
Uh, you can call me
"Uncle Willard" too, Hilda.

25:22.019 --> 25:24.988
He must be destroyed!

25:24.989 --> 25:29.992
( barking )

25:29.993 --> 25:32.161
( barking )

25:32.162 --> 25:33.429
( barking )

25:33.430 --> 25:35.464
Shoot. What's the word
for "floor"?

25:35.465 --> 25:36.966
Oh, yeah. Uh...

25:36.967 --> 25:37.834
( barks )

25:39.569 --> 25:41.404
So we'd just be getting
Mr. Kraft out of here

25:41.405 --> 25:42.972
for Aunt Zelda's own good.

25:42.973 --> 25:45.609
Absolutely.
Someday she'll thank us.

25:45.610 --> 25:47.143
Should we poison him?

25:47.144 --> 25:48.878
Don't you think
that's a little harsh?

25:48.879 --> 25:50.613
Love lifts them up
where they belong?

25:50.614 --> 25:52.582
I knew he was bothering you.

25:52.583 --> 25:54.551
We've got to find
some dirt on Kraft

25:54.552 --> 25:56.485
that will make Zelda
break up with him.

25:56.486 --> 25:59.589
Oh! Perfect:
"Real Life Story."

25:59.590 --> 26:01.057
<i>We need some dirt</i>
<i>And we need it fast</i>

26:01.058 --> 26:03.059
<i>So give us the scoop</i>
<i>On Willard Kraft</i>

26:03.060 --> 26:06.763
<i>Welcome to</i> Real Life
Story's <i>"Mediocrity Week."</i>

26:06.764 --> 26:10.566
<i>Tonight we explore the strange</i>
<i>journey of Willard Kraft.</i>

26:10.567 --> 26:12.802
<i>Elementary school</i>
<i>classmates describe him</i>

26:12.803 --> 26:16.539
<i>as "a loner," "an outsider"</i>
<i>and "doodie breath."</i>

26:16.540 --> 26:18.040
Let's fast-forward
through puberty.

26:18.041 --> 26:19.876
My hunch is it's ugly.

26:19.877 --> 26:21.544
Well, I know he had
a messy divorce.

26:21.545 --> 26:22.912
Ooh, hit "play."

26:22.913 --> 26:24.980
HOST:
<i>Her name was Lucy,</i>

26:24.981 --> 26:26.949
<i>the only woman</i>
<i>who could give Willard</i>

26:26.950 --> 26:29.084
<i>the courage to dream again.</i>

26:29.085 --> 26:32.088
<i>Love transformed</i>
<i>the normally vexatious loner</i>

26:32.089 --> 26:34.391
<i>into a frolicking free spirit.</i>

26:34.392 --> 26:36.393
<i>Whimsy was his copilot.</i>

26:36.394 --> 26:39.361
<i>Indeed, Willard Kraft was</i>
<i>in love with love.</i>

26:39.362 --> 26:41.764
<i>They were married</i>
<i>in a small, private ceremony</i>

26:41.765 --> 26:44.633
<i>presided over</i>
<i>by her massage therapist.</i>

26:46.670 --> 26:48.104
They were so in love.

26:48.105 --> 26:49.271
( sighs )

26:49.272 --> 26:51.041
I can't just sit here
and let Zelda get hurt

26:51.042 --> 26:53.576
by a man who still loves
two other women.

26:53.577 --> 26:56.112
Two? Oh. Right.

26:56.113 --> 26:57.380
We've gotta bring her back.

26:57.381 --> 26:59.382
It's gonna be so hard
on Aunt Zelda.

26:59.383 --> 27:00.950
I don't think
I can do that to her.

27:00.951 --> 27:04.286
KRAFT:
Has anyone seen
my antifungal foot ointment?

27:05.622 --> 27:06.823
<i>Mr. Kraft</i>
<i>With a past so juicy</i>

27:06.824 --> 27:08.591
<i>Return to us</i>
<i>His ex-wife Lucy</i>

27:10.995 --> 27:12.362
Ah...

27:12.363 --> 27:15.432
It's good to be back
in the mortal realm.

27:15.433 --> 27:16.766
"Mortal realm"?

27:16.767 --> 27:17.900
Wait a minute.

27:17.901 --> 27:19.168
You're a witch?!

27:24.441 --> 27:26.442
Mr. Kraft married
a witch?

27:26.443 --> 27:29.646
Well, of course,
he didn't know I was a witch.

27:29.647 --> 27:31.514
I thought it would be...

27:31.515 --> 27:33.216
less confusing that way.

27:36.019 --> 27:38.922
Oh, I have
my magic again.

27:38.923 --> 27:41.123
Oh, I adore
the mortal realm.

27:41.124 --> 27:44.193
It's such a refreshing change
from where I live:

27:44.194 --> 27:46.495
The Republic
of Infinite Horror.

27:46.496 --> 27:47.830
Sounds exotic.

27:47.831 --> 27:49.298
It's near Lake Male Superior.

27:49.299 --> 27:50.900
It's an awful part
of the Other Realm

27:50.901 --> 27:53.469
where women are forbidden
to use magic.

27:53.470 --> 27:55.238
Who came up
with that brainstorm?

27:55.239 --> 27:56.773
The men.
The men.

27:56.774 --> 27:58.641
Then why don't you just move
to the mortal realm?

27:58.642 --> 28:01.310
My republic forbids a woman
to emigrate without a husband

28:01.311 --> 28:03.179
and that's why
I married Willard.

28:03.180 --> 28:04.814
And because
you loved him.

28:05.749 --> 28:06.883
Okay.

28:06.884 --> 28:10.186
And I would do anything
to get him back.

28:10.187 --> 28:12.522
Oh, dear,
here come the waterworks.

28:13.724 --> 28:16.092
So why did
you two split up?

28:16.093 --> 28:18.828
Why does any relationship
go bad?

28:18.829 --> 28:21.698
Maybe I shouldn't have turned
him into a beast of burden,

28:21.699 --> 28:24.300
or made out
with his best friend Dexter.

28:24.301 --> 28:25.335
The bottom line is

28:25.336 --> 28:26.736
Willard divorced me,

28:26.737 --> 28:30.473
and without him,
I was deported back to the I.H.

28:30.474 --> 28:31.440
Infinite Horror.

28:31.441 --> 28:32.475
Right.

28:32.476 --> 28:33.910
Well, if it helps at all,

28:33.911 --> 28:35.611
I think
he's right downstairs.

28:35.612 --> 28:36.645
Really?

28:36.646 --> 28:39.415
I-- I haven't seen him
since the day I...

28:39.416 --> 28:43.019
left the fence unlatched
and he got out.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.221
She seems nice.

28:45.889 --> 28:47.456
( clank )

28:47.457 --> 28:48.757
Oh. Hoo-hoo.

28:48.758 --> 28:51.327
Boy, I shouldn't wait a week
to irrigate my ears.

28:52.596 --> 28:54.730
Mr. Kraft, we have
a surprise for you.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.466
Willard, darling.

28:57.467 --> 28:58.501
No. No.

28:58.502 --> 29:00.803
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

29:00.804 --> 29:02.104
This is a bad dream.

29:02.105 --> 29:03.573
( screams )

29:05.075 --> 29:08.344
( door slams )
I'm so glad he's still alive.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.914
Hey, Valerie,
I made an appointment

29:11.915 --> 29:13.015
at a portrait studio

29:13.016 --> 29:14.784
and I have the perfect way
to get Sabrina there

29:14.785 --> 29:16.018
and keep it a surprise.

29:16.019 --> 29:17.553
I'll tell her
war has broken out

29:17.554 --> 29:20.389
and I have to take her
to a secret bomb shelter.

29:20.390 --> 29:22.425
Or you could
just blindfold her

29:22.426 --> 29:24.861
and tell her
it's a surprise.

29:24.862 --> 29:26.095
Okay.

29:26.096 --> 29:28.998
So much for the sound-effect
tapes I've been making.

29:28.999 --> 29:30.466
Hello.

29:30.467 --> 29:32.468
ZELDA:
Oh, there you are,
stranger.

29:32.469 --> 29:34.203
I was beginning
to worry about you.

29:34.204 --> 29:36.973
Well, actually, I just came by
to borrow some coriander.

29:36.974 --> 29:39.943
I'm making dinner for Lucy.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.945
Lucy's a nice lady.

29:41.946 --> 29:42.879
Lucy?

29:42.880 --> 29:44.680
As in your ex-wife Lucy?

29:44.681 --> 29:49.151
Yes, apparently, she left
a hole in my life, and I...

29:50.253 --> 29:52.054
You look nice, Zelda.

29:52.055 --> 29:53.389
LUCY:
Willie-poo!

29:53.390 --> 29:54.524
Coming.

29:54.525 --> 29:56.826
Say goodbye
to Uncle Willard.

29:56.827 --> 29:59.328
I go to the trouble
of brewing you a cup

29:59.329 --> 30:02.432
of my special herb tea
and you disappear.

30:02.433 --> 30:04.467
Is it just me or are men
getting less obedient

30:04.468 --> 30:06.168
than they used to be?

30:06.169 --> 30:07.270
You must be Lucy.

30:07.271 --> 30:08.637
I'm Zelda.

30:08.638 --> 30:10.440
It's so nice
to meet you.

30:10.441 --> 30:11.874
I really miss you.

30:11.875 --> 30:13.709
LUCY: Drink your tea, dear.
Oh.

30:15.780 --> 30:16.913
Oh.

30:16.914 --> 30:19.716
Lucy has pretty eyes and...

30:19.717 --> 30:22.718
thanks to her,
no more runaway mucus.

30:22.719 --> 30:24.153
No more tissues
in the sofa cushion.

30:24.154 --> 30:25.188
I can't wait.

30:25.189 --> 30:26.389
LUCY:
Well, if you'll excuse us,

30:26.390 --> 30:28.925
I think a certain Willie-poo
has a dinner to make.

30:28.926 --> 30:31.260
Right, a dinner.

30:31.261 --> 30:33.095
They seem civil...

30:33.096 --> 30:35.064
after all these years.

30:36.700 --> 30:39.369
I think I'll, uh, take
a little walk.

30:41.805 --> 30:42.838
It's working.

30:42.839 --> 30:43.907
Yay!

30:43.908 --> 30:45.742
And Aunt Zelda's okay, right?

30:45.743 --> 30:46.575
Absolutely.

30:46.576 --> 30:47.843
This breakup
was bound to happen

30:47.844 --> 30:49.478
sooner or later,
and let's face it,

30:49.479 --> 30:52.248
the sooner the breakup,
the less pain...for us.

30:53.517 --> 30:56.119
( barking )

30:56.120 --> 30:57.220
( barks )

30:57.221 --> 30:58.421
Good, boy.

30:58.422 --> 30:59.822
Yeah, baby!

30:59.823 --> 31:01.591
I can taste the fillets.

31:01.592 --> 31:04.427
I'll just pretend
his frothy spit is a garnish.

31:05.929 --> 31:07.730
( barks )

31:07.731 --> 31:08.831
( sighs )

31:08.832 --> 31:10.333
It's so nice
that...

31:10.334 --> 31:13.903
both of you could join us
for a glass of wine.

31:13.904 --> 31:15.204
Well, I knew
there was no way

31:15.205 --> 31:17.473
I'd get this one
out of the house without me,

31:17.474 --> 31:21.811
so I finally said, "Willie-poo,
enough with the foot rubs."

31:21.812 --> 31:23.646
( Zelda chuckles )

31:23.647 --> 31:25.982
You know,
he calls me "zoo-zoo."

31:25.983 --> 31:28.784
I do?
Yes, and I call you "monkey."

31:28.785 --> 31:30.886
Like some godless
hairy primate?

31:30.887 --> 31:34.890
No, like a cute little monkey
with big eyes...

31:34.891 --> 31:36.692
and, now, he answers to "poo."

31:36.693 --> 31:38.694
There's a trade up.

31:38.695 --> 31:40.296
I'll get more wine.

31:40.297 --> 31:42.164
You two seem
to be getting along well.

31:42.165 --> 31:44.100
I like Lucy.

31:44.101 --> 31:46.001
She's a nice lady.

31:46.002 --> 31:47.003
Oh, stop.

31:47.004 --> 31:48.371
I'm sorry.

31:48.372 --> 31:49.905
Was that--?
Was that bad?

31:49.906 --> 31:51.907
No, dear,
it's a figure of speech.

31:51.908 --> 31:54.477
Fig--? Y-you're not gonna
hit me, then?

31:54.478 --> 31:56.011
( chuckling )

31:56.012 --> 31:57.380
ZELDA:
Well...

31:57.381 --> 31:59.015
KRAFT:
Ooh, I like

31:59.016 --> 32:00.783
your hair up like that.

32:00.784 --> 32:01.850
LUCY:
Willard!

32:01.851 --> 32:03.319
You look dehydrated.

32:05.489 --> 32:07.556
Uh, didn't you wanna
tell Zelda something?

32:07.557 --> 32:08.657
Yes.

32:08.658 --> 32:09.658
( clears throat )

32:09.659 --> 32:12.528
Zelda, I'm moving
out of the garage.

32:12.529 --> 32:14.730
Lucy has room
for me at her place.

32:14.731 --> 32:16.498
So thanks.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.734
I see.

32:18.735 --> 32:20.736
Well, let me tell
you something.

32:20.737 --> 32:24.540
I-- I got you cable
in that garage.

32:24.541 --> 32:26.575
What am I doing?
I'm groveling.

32:26.576 --> 32:29.245
I'm debasing myself
for a man.

32:29.246 --> 32:30.880
I sound like Hilda.

32:32.382 --> 32:34.417
Well, we should go.

32:34.418 --> 32:37.019
Your best friend Dexter's
coming over, isn't he?

32:37.020 --> 32:37.953
Shall I carry you, dear?

32:37.954 --> 32:39.054
No, not this time.

32:39.055 --> 32:40.856
We'll see ourselves out.

32:44.228 --> 32:46.929
I do not debase myself
for a man.

32:46.930 --> 32:48.264
I'm worried
about Aunt Zelda.

32:48.265 --> 32:49.499
Oh, yeah, her.

32:50.133 --> 32:51.200
Boy, it's a good thing

32:51.201 --> 32:53.936
you found out
about it now, eh, Zellie?

32:53.937 --> 32:56.172
I don't blame Willard.

32:56.173 --> 32:58.307
He seems happy.
You don't mind?

32:58.308 --> 33:01.311
Oh, when you truly care
about someone, you--

33:01.312 --> 33:03.946
You want
what's best for them...

33:03.947 --> 33:05.548
but I'm gonna miss him.

33:05.549 --> 33:07.250
Told you it was
for the best.

33:07.251 --> 33:10.586
I really don't know
why I care about that man,

33:10.587 --> 33:12.922
just he makes me so happy.

33:12.923 --> 33:15.124
Aunt Zelda, you don't
know the whole story.

33:15.125 --> 33:16.559
Lucy's from
the Other Realm.

33:16.560 --> 33:17.827
I brought her back.

33:17.828 --> 33:19.228
You what?!

33:19.229 --> 33:21.597
Aunt Hilda
and I brought her back.

33:21.598 --> 33:24.400
We had to.
He did yoga in a unitard.

33:24.401 --> 33:27.035
Wait a minute.
Lucy's a witch?

33:27.036 --> 33:29.238
Yeah, and she's using magic
to get him back.

33:29.239 --> 33:31.707
He doesn't like her,
it's the tea talking.

33:31.708 --> 33:34.443
How dare you two try
to break up Willard and me.

33:34.444 --> 33:35.745
Don't dwell on the past.

33:35.746 --> 33:37.012
You can compete
with Lucy.

33:37.013 --> 33:38.614
Start brewing potions pronto.

33:39.916 --> 33:43.685
Try the All's-Fair-
in-Love-and-War spell.

33:43.686 --> 33:46.288
Quick. I think she's
ordering him an ear tag.

33:46.289 --> 33:47.623
Maybe one little potion.

33:52.362 --> 33:54.096
I've got to get
that modem fixed.

33:54.097 --> 33:55.864
Oh, look,
your hair's down again.

33:55.865 --> 33:58.834
I guess everything eventually
loses the battle with gravity.

33:58.835 --> 33:59.768
( gavel pounds )

33:59.769 --> 34:01.170
JUDGE:
Silence!

34:01.171 --> 34:03.572
Do you know why the council
pulled you in here, ladies?

34:03.573 --> 34:04.874
Because you're lonely?

34:06.509 --> 34:09.311
"Two witches battling
over a mortal..."

34:09.312 --> 34:11.447
A vice principal?

34:11.447 --> 34:14.484
He's a heartbeat away from
running the entire high school.

34:14.485 --> 34:15.717
And he loves me.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.286
Your Honor, I'm not involved
with thi--

34:17.286 --> 34:18.320
Silence!

34:19.322 --> 34:20.523
Well,
you know the law.

34:20.524 --> 34:23.125
The Witches' Council
has clearly stated

34:23.126 --> 34:24.860
that cases
such as these

34:24.860 --> 34:27.096
must be settled
in an appropriate forum,

34:27.097 --> 34:30.266
one that is fair
and full of wisdom.

34:30.266 --> 34:32.400
AUDIENCE ( chanting ):
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

34:32.402 --> 34:34.503
<i>The Jerry Springer Show?</i>

34:36.005 --> 34:37.473
You know, uh, Zelda thought

34:37.474 --> 34:38.974
she had a good thing
going with Willard

34:38.975 --> 34:40.909
until his ex-wife Lucy
came to town

34:40.909 --> 34:42.511
with a simple warning:

34:42.512 --> 34:45.214
"Get your hands off my mortal."

34:45.215 --> 34:47.516
AUDIENCE:
Ooh!

34:47.516 --> 34:48.984
Why are they so excited?

34:48.985 --> 34:50.152
Because he's my man.

34:50.154 --> 34:53.155
You were just keeping him warm
till I got back.

34:53.156 --> 34:54.889
AUDIENCE:
Ooh!

34:54.891 --> 34:57.860
Obviously, you're very upset.
Uh, tell us how it all started.

34:57.861 --> 34:58.927
Well, you have
to understand,

34:58.928 --> 35:00.896
Mr. Kraft is not just
Zelda's boyfriend.

35:00.897 --> 35:02.698
He's also my vice principal.

35:02.699 --> 35:03.699
AUDIENCE:
Ooh!

35:03.700 --> 35:05.401
And my ex-boyfriend.

35:05.402 --> 35:06.836
AUDIENCE:
Whoo!

35:06.837 --> 35:08.204
It was really hard
living with him,

35:08.205 --> 35:10.639
so we decided
to bring back his ex-wife.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.074
( audience jeers )

35:12.075 --> 35:12.108
We didn't know
she was a witch!
