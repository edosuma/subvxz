<i>This week on Vice,
a surge in terrorism</i>

00:10.068 --> 00:12.635
<i>that's threatening
the unity of Europe.</i>

00:19.377 --> 00:21.711
<i>We've just sat through
the final presidential debate.</i>

00:21.713 --> 00:23.413
<i>The only word
that I really understood</i>

00:23.415 --> 00:25.681
throughout the whole thing
was the word "Nazi."

<i>And then an inside look

<i>with one of its

President Trump's
immigration policy,

01:11.193 --> 01:12.726
<i>including a proposed border wall</i>

01:12.728 --> 01:14.561
<i>and what's been called
a "Muslim ban,"</i>

01:14.563 --> 01:16.896
<i>sent shock waves
around the world.</i>

01:16.898 --> 01:19.198
We are going to stop

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
the Syrian refugees

01:21.202 --> 01:23.602
from entering the United States.

01:23.604 --> 01:25.404
We want Trump!

01:25.406 --> 01:27.673
But these issues
are not uniquely American.

01:27.675 --> 01:30.709
The European Union is grappling
with a similar breed

01:30.711 --> 01:33.378
<i>of populist politics
with far-right candidates</i>

01:33.380 --> 01:35.646
<i>making huge gains across Europe.</i>

01:35.648 --> 01:36.915
<i>Fear of foreigners</i>

01:36.917 --> 01:38.649
or doubts
about economic management

01:38.651 --> 01:41.686
have led to a rise
in extremist populist parties.

01:41.688 --> 01:43.922
<i>Great Britain
has already decided</i>

01:43.924 --> 01:45.390
<i>to leave the EU altogether</i>

01:45.392 --> 01:47.058
and the fight over immigration

01:47.060 --> 01:49.060
could determine
Europe's political course

01:49.062 --> 01:50.361
for years to come.

02:21.592 --> 02:24.559
<i>In Hungary, Prime Minister
Viktor Orb치n's government</i>

02:24.561 --> 02:28.663
<i>has put this European Union
border country on lockdown.</i>

02:28.665 --> 02:32.801
<i>A 181-mile border fence
was built in 2015</i>

02:32.803 --> 02:35.703
<i>to stop the flow of refugees
from entering the country</i>

02:35.705 --> 02:37.739
<i>from Serbia or Croatia.</i>

02:37.741 --> 02:39.942
<i>National Police chief
K치roly Papp</i>

02:39.944 --> 02:43.010
<i>oversees Hungary's
border control operations.</i>

02:43.012 --> 02:46.513
How effective is
the police operation down there?

03:07.269 --> 03:09.669
<i>Hungary's crime rate was
actually on the decline</i>

03:09.671 --> 03:11.704
<i>prior to the fence being built,</i>

03:11.706 --> 03:13.673
<i>but rural farmers
in border towns</i>

03:13.675 --> 03:15.107
<i>were facing practical issues</i>

03:15.109 --> 03:17.576
<i>as the flow of refugees
increased.</i>

03:17.578 --> 03:20.779
How have things changed here
in the last few years?

04:19.036 --> 04:22.571
<i>In order to justify closing
what used to be an open border,</i>

04:22.573 --> 04:25.573
<i>Prime Minister Orb치n amplifies
the farmer's fear,</i>

04:25.575 --> 04:28.910
<i>citing terror threats
as the primary reason.</i>

04:36.253 --> 04:39.287
<i>As Europe sees
more and more attacks</i>

04:39.289 --> 04:41.422
<i>by ISIS affiliated terrorists,</i>

04:41.424 --> 04:43.990
<i>populists put the blame
on the increased influx</i>

04:43.992 --> 04:46.927
<i>of refugees
from the Middle East.</i>

04:46.929 --> 04:49.296
<i>As a result,
thousands of refugees</i>

04:49.298 --> 04:51.532
<i>are now being stopped
at the border.</i>

04:51.534 --> 04:54.368
What's it like
to police this area?

05:26.967 --> 05:28.300
<i>After the fence was built,</i>

05:28.302 --> 05:30.068
<i>refugee camps started forming</i>

05:30.070 --> 05:31.902
<i>on the Serbian side
of the border,</i>

05:31.904 --> 05:34.105
<i>where migrants wait
for their opportunity</i>

05:34.107 --> 05:36.006
<i>to sneak into Hungary.</i>

05:36.008 --> 05:37.274
Hi.

05:38.377 --> 05:40.144
Hello.

05:40.146 --> 05:41.579
How are you?

05:42.715 --> 05:44.482
How old are you?

05:44.484 --> 05:46.049
Your age.

05:46.051 --> 05:47.485
11.
All right.

05:47.487 --> 05:48.684
Where are you from?

05:49.887 --> 05:51.121
Afghanistan.

05:53.825 --> 05:55.258
Nice to meet you.

05:59.531 --> 06:01.164
These children,

06:01.166 --> 06:04.167
they're--they're not terrorists,
are they?

06:06.203 --> 06:08.970
That must make you feel
something when you see them.

06:26.189 --> 06:29.390
<i>These decisions come directly
from the Hungarian government.</i>

06:29.392 --> 06:31.058
<i>While many other EU countries</i>

06:31.060 --> 06:33.761
<i>followed Germany's lead
in welcoming the refugees,</i>

06:33.763 --> 06:37.231
<i>Hungary surged to the right,
sealing its borders.</i>

06:37.233 --> 06:39.033
<i>We sat down
with Orb치n's spokesman</i>

06:39.035 --> 06:40.233
<i>to find out why.</i>

06:40.235 --> 06:44.171
Why did Hungary see it
as its responsibility

06:44.173 --> 06:47.073
to be the bastions
of law and order

06:47.075 --> 06:48.475
for the European Union,

06:48.477 --> 06:51.278
when Angela Merkel had said

06:51.280 --> 06:53.012
that refugees--

06:53.014 --> 06:54.147
Use--use the proper terms

06:54.149 --> 06:56.482
because up until they have
a legal status

06:56.484 --> 06:58.016
everybody should be called
a migrant.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.218
As a matter of fact,
an illegal migrant.

06:59.220 --> 07:02.555
The European Union is
a community of states

07:02.557 --> 07:05.691
in which there are rules,
and that was our major problem,

07:05.693 --> 07:07.793
actually,
with the German position.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.663
How can you request,
without our consent,

07:10.665 --> 07:11.997
that you don't follow the rules?

07:11.999 --> 07:15.633
Do you think that refugees
have a right to come to Europe?

07:15.635 --> 07:18.636
Nowhere in international law
is it suggested

07:18.638 --> 07:21.906
that you have the right of
freedom without authorization.

07:21.908 --> 07:25.076
You're not allowed
to be naive on that.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.744
<i>Quite a number
of the perpetrators</i>

07:26.746 --> 07:28.145
<i>of the Paris attacks</i>

07:28.147 --> 07:31.114
<i>and the bombing
at the Brussels airport,</i>

07:31.116 --> 07:32.982
<i>they're coming through Hungary</i>

07:32.984 --> 07:35.819
<i>using basically
the illegal flow of migrants</i>

07:35.821 --> 07:37.221
<i>to the European Union.</i>

07:37.223 --> 07:39.656
<i>That's a serious breach
of security.</i>

07:39.658 --> 07:41.758
There are many who,

07:41.760 --> 07:44.127
under the camouflage
of a religion,

07:44.129 --> 07:47.896
extremists would like
to wipe out a civilization.

07:47.898 --> 07:49.465
<i>As Mr. Schuman put it,</i>

07:49.467 --> 07:51.400
<i>one of the founding fathers
of the European Union,</i>

07:51.402 --> 07:54.103
<i>"Europe will be
or should be Christian,</i>

07:54.105 --> 07:56.138
or will not be."

07:56.140 --> 07:58.541
If you want to get rid
of the core values,

07:58.543 --> 07:59.609
then you are getting rid of

07:59.611 --> 08:01.744
the original sense
of that community.

08:03.147 --> 08:05.447
<i>Across the EU,
far-right candidates</i>

08:05.449 --> 08:07.148
<i>are using the immigration debate</i>

08:07.150 --> 08:08.783
<i>to push a nationalist agenda</i>

08:08.785 --> 08:10.785
<i>that's threatening
the very existence</i>

08:10.787 --> 08:12.186
<i>of the EU itself.</i>

08:17.394 --> 08:18.860
<i>The past few years have shown</i>

08:18.862 --> 08:20.328
<i>the biggest increase in votes</i>

08:20.330 --> 08:22.062
<i>for nationalist
and populist parties</i>

08:22.064 --> 08:24.931
<i>in Europe since World War II.</i>

08:24.933 --> 08:27.134
<i>Following Trump's victory
in the U.S.,</i>

08:27.136 --> 08:29.069
<i>the world's eyes turned
to the next election</i>

08:29.071 --> 08:31.639
<i>with a far-right candidate:
Austria,</i>

08:31.641 --> 08:33.940
<i>where Independent
Alexander Van Der Bellen</i>

08:33.942 --> 08:37.378
<i>was fending off Norbert Hofer
of Austria's Freedom Party.</i>

08:37.380 --> 08:39.645
<i>Suddenly,
the left-leaning country</i>

08:39.648 --> 08:42.214
<i>was on the brink of electing
a far-right president</i>

08:42.216 --> 08:44.216
<i>for the first time in decades.</i>

08:49.724 --> 08:51.824
<i>Norbert Hofer, a gun loving,</i>

08:51.826 --> 08:53.025
<i>anti Islam populist</i>

08:53.027 --> 08:54.627
<i>representing the Freedom Party,</i>

08:54.629 --> 08:56.895
<i>founded by Ex-Nazis.</i>

08:56.897 --> 08:59.130
<i>Among the founding members
of the Freedom Party</i>

08:59.132 --> 09:02.768
<i>was high-ranking SS general
Anton Reinthaller</i>

09:02.770 --> 09:04.169
<i>who founded the party</i>

09:04.171 --> 09:06.371
<i>to strengthen
nationalist interests</i>

09:06.373 --> 09:08.373
<i>in post World War II Austria.</i>

09:08.375 --> 09:10.108
<i>We traveled to Austria</i>

09:10.110 --> 09:12.943
<i>as one of Europe's
most polarizing elections</i>

09:12.945 --> 09:14.978
<i>reached its climax.</i>

09:34.533 --> 09:37.400
<i>We're in Vienna, where one of
the most divisive elections</i>

09:37.402 --> 09:41.070
in Austria's recent history
is about to come to an end.

09:41.072 --> 09:44.474
Whether the people here decide
to go left or right

09:44.476 --> 09:46.675
<i>will also decide
what might happen</i>

09:46.677 --> 09:48.477
to the future
of the European Union.

09:51.449 --> 09:55.116
<i>How much is Islamophobia
playing in this election?</i>

10:25.347 --> 10:27.881
<i>Lena took me
to a campaign appearance</i>

10:27.883 --> 10:30.550
<i>by Hofer's opponent
Alexander Van Der Bellen.</i>

10:32.254 --> 10:33.687
Alexander Van Der Bellen!

11:09.188 --> 11:12.489
<i>Across town, Hofer was
also focused on immigration,</i>

11:12.491 --> 11:16.326
<i>but took a hard-line approach
to the crisis.</i>

11:47.090 --> 11:48.757
<i>With the candidates
neck-and-neck,</i>

11:48.759 --> 11:50.459
<i>both sides were out
in full force</i>

11:50.461 --> 11:52.527
<i>before the final
presidential debate.</i>

11:52.529 --> 11:55.530
Hofer!

12:00.270 --> 12:02.937
<i>It's just before
the final presidential debate</i>

12:02.939 --> 12:05.506
<i>and supporters
of the two candidates</i>

12:05.508 --> 12:07.407
<i>are here in a face-off.</i>

12:07.409 --> 12:10.511
What this says about
what's going to happen inside

12:10.513 --> 12:11.979
we'll see.

12:22.357 --> 12:24.891
Mr. Hofer, how will it feel
to become Europe's first

12:24.893 --> 12:26.793
far-right leader since the war?

12:26.795 --> 12:29.028
Umm, first of all,
I'm not the leader,

12:29.030 --> 12:31.163
and second I'm not far-right.

12:31.165 --> 12:33.766
So why do people
describe you as that?

12:33.768 --> 12:35.935
They don't know me.
Not yet.

12:37.838 --> 12:40.873
<i>As is tradition in Austria's
presidential elections,</i>

12:40.875 --> 12:43.208
<i>the press
and both candidates' teams</i>

12:43.210 --> 12:45.611
<i>gather to watch
the final debate backstage</i>

12:45.613 --> 12:48.279
<i>while eating wieners
and drinking beer.</i>

12:48.281 --> 12:50.448
<i>But what started
as a strange Austrian barbecue</i>

12:50.450 --> 12:52.217
<i>gave way to something
that was bizarre</i>

12:52.219 --> 12:54.451
<i>even by U.S. standards.</i>

13:49.039 --> 13:51.405
<i>We've just sat through
the final presidential debate</i>

13:51.407 --> 13:52.974
<i>before the elections.</i>

13:52.976 --> 13:54.676
The only word
that I really understood

13:54.678 --> 13:57.311
throughout the whole thing
was the word "Nazi."

13:57.313 --> 13:59.213
<i>We're now sitting
in the spin room afterwards</i>

13:59.215 --> 14:00.582
<i>where the two candidates
are here.</i>

14:00.584 --> 14:03.584
<i>Hofer, behind me, is sitting
around with his team,</i>

14:03.586 --> 14:06.119
<i>smoking cigarettes,
drinking glasses of wine.</i>

14:06.121 --> 14:08.021
I've never seen anything
really like this.

14:08.023 --> 14:11.825
Some people have described you
as an anti-establishment figure.

14:11.827 --> 14:13.560
Is that accurate?

14:35.182 --> 14:38.116
What happens in the end
of this--this campaign?

14:38.118 --> 14:40.485
The people, they will, uh, vote.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.111
Wow.

15:44.113 --> 15:46.147
I mean, people are crying here.

15:46.149 --> 15:48.582
It's clear that
it means so much to people.

15:48.584 --> 15:51.518
Does this feel like
a different Austria now?

15:51.520 --> 15:53.420
No, because I know
that there's still,

15:53.422 --> 15:57.158
like, nearly 50%
who voted for Hofer, so...

15:57.160 --> 15:58.559
No.
Actually, you have--

15:58.561 --> 16:01.227
you still have to consider,
actually there is

16:01.229 --> 16:03.563
50% super racist people
in Austria.

16:03.565 --> 16:05.999
<i>While Hofer lost in Austria,</i>

16:06.001 --> 16:09.368
<i>the fierce political divide
has spread across Europe.</i>

16:09.370 --> 16:11.805
<i>In France,
a formerly fringe candidate,</i>

16:11.807 --> 16:13.940
<i>Marine Le Pen,
came in second place</i>

16:13.942 --> 16:15.675
<i>on an anti-immigration platform</i>

16:15.677 --> 16:18.110
<i>that could have seen France
leave the EU.</i>

16:24.351 --> 16:27.019
<i>But the most important
election will be in Germany,</i>

16:27.021 --> 16:29.254
<i>the unofficial leader of the EU,</i>

16:29.256 --> 16:31.056
<i>which took in more refugees</i>

16:31.058 --> 16:33.225
<i>than any other European country.</i>

16:33.227 --> 16:35.159
<i>As a result, the once peripheral</i>

16:35.161 --> 16:38.262
<i>far-right populist AfD party
emerged</i>

16:38.264 --> 16:41.465
<i>in direct opposition
to Chancellor Angela Merkel.</i>

16:49.042 --> 16:50.608
<i>Since World War II,</i>

16:50.610 --> 16:53.276
<i>being ultra-right-wing
has been taboo in Germany,</i>

16:53.278 --> 16:55.045
<i>yet the AfD is gaining power</i>

16:55.047 --> 16:57.614
<i>by exploiting
the sharp increase in conflicts</i>

16:57.616 --> 16:59.983
<i>between refugees and locals.</i>

16:59.985 --> 17:03.453
<i>In 2016,
the German Ministry of Interior</i>

17:03.455 --> 17:05.856
<i>reported more than
3 1/2 thousand attacks</i>

17:05.858 --> 17:09.324
<i>on refugees and shelters
throughout the country.</i>

17:10.361 --> 17:12.094
<i>The rural town of Bautzen,</i>

17:12.096 --> 17:13.528
<i>is capturing headlines</i>

17:13.530 --> 17:15.430
<i>with particularly violent
clashes.</i>

17:15.432 --> 17:18.367
<i>Onlookers celebrated
as a fire ripped through</i>

17:18.368 --> 17:20.368
<i>a former hotel
that was being converted</i>

17:20.371 --> 17:22.371
<i>into a shelter for refugees.</i>

17:35.418 --> 17:37.551
<i>Sebastian Berg is well connected</i>

17:37.553 --> 17:39.687
<i>with the local
right wing community.</i>

17:39.689 --> 17:42.657
<i>We joined him and his local
AfD representative</i>

17:42.659 --> 17:44.691
<i>on a tour of the embattled town.</i>

18:01.709 --> 18:03.810
<i>While the right wing claims
that locals need</i>

18:03.812 --> 18:05.678
<i>to protect themselves
from refugees,</i>

18:05.680 --> 18:07.880
<i>the town's largest
refugee center</i>

18:07.882 --> 18:09.415
<i>had to build its own fence</i>

18:09.417 --> 18:12.318
<i>to protect the refugees
from angry locals.</i>

18:12.320 --> 18:16.189
What's the problem
with a place like this?

18:43.716 --> 18:45.615
<i>We went to meet
some of the refugees</i>

18:45.617 --> 18:47.784
<i>that the locals
were living in fear of.</i>

18:51.990 --> 18:54.790
<i>While the majority of migrants
we saw were families,</i>

18:54.792 --> 18:57.327
<i>much of the fear is
of single young men.</i>

18:57.329 --> 18:59.595
<i>Firas has mastered the language,</i>

18:59.597 --> 19:01.164
<i>but is still facing backlash</i>

19:01.166 --> 19:04.300
<i>as he tries to integrate
into society.</i>

19:35.598 --> 19:36.864
Hello, how are you?

19:36.866 --> 19:38.366
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

19:38.368 --> 19:39.867
- Yeah.
- I'm Ben.

19:39.869 --> 19:42.435
<i>This young family
fled the resulting chaos</i>

19:42.437 --> 19:44.070
<i>of the U.S. war in Iraq.</i>

19:44.072 --> 19:45.505
Why are you here?

20:25.711 --> 20:28.212
Mama.

20:29.882 --> 20:33.716
<i>With over a million refugees
settled in Germany since 2015,</i>

20:33.718 --> 20:36.553
<i>and anti-immigrant sentiment
on the rise,</i>

20:36.555 --> 20:38.688
<i>the AfD and their leader,</i>

20:38.690 --> 20:40.790
<i>Frauke Petry,
are using the issue</i>

20:40.792 --> 20:44.094
<i>in their bid to unseat
Chancellor Angela Merkel.</i>

20:44.096 --> 20:46.163
Do you think Angela Merkel
has improved Germany

20:46.165 --> 20:49.066
- since her time in power?
- No, I don't think she has.

20:49.068 --> 20:51.600
Because she opened the border
for illegal migration,

20:51.602 --> 20:55.004
to more than a million people
in 2015.

20:55.006 --> 20:59.041
Many of them cannot read,
have not finished school.

20:59.043 --> 21:01.143
Many of them will be
completely dependent

21:01.145 --> 21:04.146
for the rest of their lives
on social benefits,

21:04.148 --> 21:06.115
and if government tells us,

21:06.117 --> 21:09.550
as Merkel did in Autumn 2015,

21:09.552 --> 21:12.287
that we do not have the control
about our borders,

21:12.289 --> 21:15.457
we don't have the control
about who lives in German,

21:15.459 --> 21:18.893
that is basically
the complete failing of a state.

21:18.895 --> 21:20.928
Why was immigration
a central policy

21:20.930 --> 21:23.531
for Trump and for BREXIT

21:23.533 --> 21:25.632
and for the AfD here in Germany?

21:25.634 --> 21:27.667
Immigration was not

21:27.669 --> 21:30.004
a central topic
when we started--

21:30.006 --> 21:31.638
But it's become one for you,
personally.

21:31.640 --> 21:32.772
It's become more important

21:32.774 --> 21:35.342
because situation changed
dramatically.

21:35.344 --> 21:36.477
Why do you think
there's an appetite

21:36.479 --> 21:39.179
for anti-establishment politics
in Germany now?

21:39.181 --> 21:42.048
We have many statistics seen
over the last couple of years

21:42.050 --> 21:44.984
of people not trusting
politicians anymore.

21:46.554 --> 21:49.822
<i>What did politics do
over the last couple of decades</i>

21:49.824 --> 21:51.824
<i>to make people feel excluded?</i>

21:55.463 --> 21:57.830
<i>I think many citizens are fed up</i>

21:57.832 --> 22:00.632
<i>with politicians
not talking to them,</i>

22:00.634 --> 22:02.501
but talking about them

22:02.503 --> 22:04.769
and not taking them seriously,

22:04.771 --> 22:08.873
<i>and that is something that many
people in Europe do not like.</i>

22:08.875 --> 22:10.942
<i>So, yes,
I think it gains momentum,</i>

22:10.944 --> 22:12.277
and I hope it will gain
even more.

22:18.117 --> 22:19.850
"Vice" has been following
the rise

22:19.852 --> 22:22.253
of the far-right in Europe
for many years.

22:22.255 --> 22:23.387
We watched and reported

22:23.389 --> 22:24.955
<i>as nationalism exploded</i>

22:24.957 --> 22:26.957
<i>in response
to the migrant crisis</i>

22:26.959 --> 22:28.592
<i>currently facing Europe.</i>

22:35.800 --> 22:37.500
You wanna keep
the Greek race clean.

22:39.471 --> 22:41.871
Italian Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi

22:41.873 --> 22:44.774
was in many ways modern Europe's
original populist.

22:44.776 --> 22:47.810
<i>He gained massive support
from Italian media outlets,</i>

22:47.812 --> 22:49.111
<i>many of which he owned,</i>

22:49.113 --> 22:51.280
<i>and cultivated
a large political base</i>

22:51.282 --> 22:55.184
<i>by clamping down on immigration
and embracing isolationism.</i>

22:59.423 --> 23:01.190
<i>I met him at his home in Italy</i>

23:01.192 --> 23:03.225
to talk about
what the future holds

23:03.227 --> 23:05.494
for European politics.

23:56.144 --> 23:59.477
<i>Former Italian Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi</i>

23:59.479 --> 24:01.112
<i>is one of
the most outspoken critics</i>

24:01.114 --> 24:02.647
<i>of allowing immigrants
from Syria</i>

24:02.649 --> 24:06.251
<i>and other war-torn countries
into Europe.</i>

24:06.253 --> 24:07.785
<i>The former leader of Italy was</i>

24:07.787 --> 24:09.354
<i>the longest sitting
prime minster</i>

24:09.356 --> 24:10.888
<i>in modern Italian history,</i>

24:10.890 --> 24:12.524
<i>and though his political career
was marred</i>

24:12.526 --> 24:14.691
<i>with controversy, fraud,
and scandal...</i>

24:22.100 --> 24:25.135
<i>He was also one of the
original far-right candidates,</i>

24:25.137 --> 24:27.737
<i>using fear of immigration
to great success,</i>

24:27.739 --> 24:31.207
<i>which set the mold for other
populous candidates in Europe.</i>

24:31.209 --> 24:34.143
So you look at what happened
in Austria recently,

24:34.145 --> 24:37.413
a far-right party came second,
but nearly came first,

24:37.415 --> 24:40.149
and now you have the rise
of the far-right in Germany.

24:40.151 --> 24:41.584
Should Europe be worried

24:41.586 --> 24:43.219
about this sort of rise
of the far-right

24:43.221 --> 24:45.388
in Austria and Germany?

25:11.980 --> 25:13.814
<i>Now what we've seen
this season is that</i>

25:13.816 --> 25:17.117
<i>this anger is often rooted
in the immigration issue,</i>

25:17.119 --> 25:20.787
<i>and it's not just Hungary,
Austria, and Germany...</i>

25:20.789 --> 25:22.722
Oh, shit.

25:22.724 --> 25:25.658
<i>But also in France
where opposition has surged</i>

25:25.660 --> 25:28.461
<i>against the migrant population,</i>

25:28.463 --> 25:30.697
<i>and here in Berlusconi's
home country of Italy,</i>

25:30.699 --> 25:32.965
<i>hundreds of thousands
of refugees</i>

25:32.967 --> 25:34.334
<i>cross the Mediterranean</i>

25:34.336 --> 25:36.135
<i>to begin
their long journey north</i>

25:36.137 --> 25:38.037
<i>into the EU.</i>

25:38.039 --> 25:40.839
You have millions of people
coming from Syria,

25:40.841 --> 25:44.008
from North Africa,
from Afghanistan.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.711
Italy is on the frontlines.

25:45.713 --> 25:48.313
How much is it affecting
Italian politics?

25:48.315 --> 25:51.149
But even larger,
how much is this affecting

25:51.151 --> 25:53.017
politics in Europe?

26:32.623 --> 26:35.190
<i>Now what he means when
he references the Marshall Plan</i>

26:35.192 --> 26:38.727
<i>is approximately
the $130 billion aid project,</i>

26:38.729 --> 26:40.729
<i>which rebuilt
war-devastated regions</i>

26:40.731 --> 26:44.166
<i>of Western Europe in
the aftermath of World War II.</i>

26:44.168 --> 26:46.001
<i>Now the idea is that</i>

26:46.003 --> 26:47.835
<i>the only way to stop immigration</i>

26:47.837 --> 26:49.270
<i>is to actually stop the issues</i>

26:49.272 --> 26:51.972
<i>that are causing it
at their source.</i>

26:51.974 --> 26:54.342
<i>But while he calls
for a unified plan,</i>

26:54.344 --> 26:57.445
<i>other European politicians
are running campaigns</i>

26:57.447 --> 26:59.414
<i>for a more divided Europe.</i>

26:59.416 --> 27:01.683
<i>I interviewed Marine Le Pen
in 2012</i>

27:01.685 --> 27:05.084
<i>as she first began to declare
her anti-immigration</i>

27:05.086 --> 27:07.421
<i>isolationist populist platform.</i>

27:21.502 --> 27:23.302
<i>Le Pen has since made
a huge leap</i>

27:23.304 --> 27:25.037
<i>as this formerly
French candidate</i>

27:25.039 --> 27:27.807
<i>went on to come in second place
in the French elections,</i>

27:27.809 --> 27:30.643
<i>and her party
is not backing down.</i>

27:41.488 --> 27:44.188
Europe, America,
maybe even the world

27:44.190 --> 27:46.658
has a history of going left
and then going right,

27:46.660 --> 27:48.326
and then going left
and then going right.

27:48.328 --> 27:51.162
Right now we seem to be taking
a step to the right.

27:51.164 --> 27:52.664
Why do you think that is?

28:51.487 --> 28:55.956
Where do you see the future
of politics going

28:55.958 --> 28:57.425
in the EU

28:57.427 --> 28:59.860
and what do you worry
most about?

28:59.862 --> 29:01.962
What are your biggest fears?
