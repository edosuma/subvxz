00:05.460 --> 00:07.280
You're the one who had me

00:07.290 --> 00:09.326
abducted in a parking lot.

00:09.330 --> 00:12.288
What we need, you and I,
is some honesty.

00:12.290 --> 00:15.168
Okay, since
we're being honest,

00:15.170 --> 00:17.161
did your people
kill my father?

00:17.170 --> 00:18.285
You're military.

00:18.290 --> 00:20.076
Was sleeping with me
part of the job?

00:20.080 --> 00:21.456
Came up with that
all on my own.

00:21.460 --> 00:24.202
[Xander] This feels good,
you and me.

00:24.210 --> 00:25.279
Letsleave
all that crap In the past.

00:25.290 --> 00:27.246
This man is a Pownall.

00:27.250 --> 00:30.287
He's a descendant of Charles
who killed our kind.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.498
You don't tell me
before about your family.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.412
Ben's family kill
because they are angry.

00:36.420 --> 00:38.411
Murder.

00:38.420 --> 00:42.038
[Ben] I don't think mating
feels so good for the males.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.280
The females bite them.

00:43.290 --> 00:46.032
They hit them
with their tails.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.371

01:02.290 --> 01:04.372
She didn't say goodbye.

01:04.380 --> 01:06.245
I mean,
it's kinda weird, right?

01:06.250 --> 01:09.071
She had her mind
on other things.

It's more than that.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.577
Something happened

Ryn found out

02:10.540 --> 02:12.280
Were you?

Maybe.

02:24.420 --> 02:26.411
You guys have got to talk.

you'll explain it to her.

[Ben] If she comes
back pregnant,

02:37.250 --> 02:39.571
we'll have to hide her
from the military.

02:39.580 --> 02:42.162
And her baby. I mean,

02:42.170 --> 02:44.570
they'd never let them
go back in the water.

She was buried in it?

04:15.420 --> 04:16.569
Yeah.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.411
Who would do this?

04:25.620 --> 04:27.497
Why don't you
drop me at the lab?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.411
The results of
the ocean water test
might be ready.

04:29.420 --> 04:30.705
I'll deal

Where's Maddie?

06:15.540 --> 06:16.746
Am not with baby.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.820
You know that already?

06:18.830 --> 06:20.536
Yes, I can tell.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.576
Body change with baby, and

06:22.580 --> 06:24.457
no change.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.496
I thought that you and Ben
were managing her.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.877
She goes back
from time to time to refresh.

-She'll be back soon.
-Okay.

07:04.580 --> 07:07.572
Oh, uh, your ocean water
tests came back.

We're interested
in the fertility research
you've been doing.

Understanding
their reproduction is
quite important to us.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.786
[Maddie] I told him
she was back in the ocean.

07:18.790 --> 07:20.701
Not sure he bought it.

07:20.710 --> 07:22.610
How's she doing?

07:22.620 --> 07:24.781
She's just sleeping off
the transition.

07:24.790 --> 07:27.577
She wants me to
drop her off at Helen's
when she wakes up.

07:27.580 --> 07:28.615
I'll meet you
over there.

08:52.620 --> 08:54.702
I was, uh,

08:54.710 --> 08:57.611
doing some baseline stats
for a study.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.668
-Baseline stats?
-Yeah.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.820
I'm gonna go ahead
and call bullshit on that.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.660
It looks like you were just

09:04.670 --> 09:07.958
listening to Ryn's
mind control shit again.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.996
You gotta cut
that crap off, man.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.786
It's messin'
with your head.

09:11.790 --> 09:14.782
So what brings you here,

09:14.790 --> 09:15.996
other than the lecture?

09:16.000 --> 09:16.989
I, um...

09:19.040 --> 09:21.031
I did something
I shouldn't have.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.200
What were you thinking,

09:22.210 --> 09:23.245
bringing a reporter
to the graveyard?

09:23.250 --> 09:26.287
I wasn't thinking, okay?

09:26.290 --> 09:28.030
I was just desperate
to get him off my back,

09:28.040 --> 09:29.246
and I wanted
to protect you guys.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.376
What did you
expect him to do?

09:30.380 --> 09:32.075
I don't know, okay?

09:32.080 --> 09:33.957
I just thought
showing him the graves

09:33.960 --> 09:36.997
would be enough, somehow.
Okay, it was stupid.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.286
-But now I just want
to figure out who did it.
-We know who did it.

09:39.290 --> 09:41.167

let that happen.

09:41.170 --> 09:42.319

09:42.330 --> 09:45.163

of this thing.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.112
You haven't told her
about her snster's grave?

10:01.210 --> 10:03.371
No. Not yet.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.161
I'll tell her later
when we're alone.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.160
I missed you.

10:15.170 --> 10:16.410
I missed you, too.

10:16.420 --> 10:18.240

aren't getting pregnant.

plastics...

10:35.080 --> 10:37.457
Causing fertility problems,
just like we thought.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.325
No babies in water.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.069
No.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.207
BPAs from the water

10:44.210 --> 10:45.416
pass out of the body
in about 24 hours.

10:45.420 --> 10:49.493
But they breathe
the water like air.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.456

exposed to it.

Come with me. I'll
get you some breakfast.

13:45.790 --> 13:48.611
Hey, Ryn,
before you do this,

13:48.620 --> 13:49.700
we have some questions.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.821
If you mate in human form,

13:52.830 --> 13:54.912
will the baby
be born as a human?

13:54.920 --> 13:57.662
Should it be born
on land or at sea?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.787
The only documented story
of a birth on land

14:00.790 --> 14:04.783
by a member of your colony
is the Charles Pownall story.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.615
And the baby lived.

14:07.620 --> 14:09.918
Yes, but
with great difficulty.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.957
We're not sure
what'll happen, exactly,

14:12.960 --> 14:14.780
if you get pregnant
this way.

14:14.790 --> 14:18.669

it will be family.

I don't know a Levi.

[fire crackling]

17:03.830 --> 17:06.663
I'm not my family, okay?

17:08.540 --> 17:09.825
I need you to know that.

17:09.830 --> 17:11.707
This man in your family.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.569
Charles.

17:16.750 --> 17:19.913
He loved one like me,

17:19.920 --> 17:21.706
and his love turned bad.

17:21.710 --> 17:23.951
It makes him angry.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.916
He killed my people.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.876
And it starts with love.

17:29.790 --> 17:30.779
Like...

17:32.620 --> 17:33.871
[crying]
Like Ben love Ryn.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.916
It's not gonna
happen like that.

17:37.540 --> 17:38.609
I won't let it.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.702
Then why do you lie?

17:40.710 --> 17:42.496
Not tell me
all this time?

17:43.790 --> 17:44.950
You say nothing.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.746
I didn't know
what to say.

17:46.750 --> 17:47.739
No!

17:49.710 --> 17:50.825
I do not trust.

[door unlatches]

18:08.620 --> 18:09.780
It didn't go well?

18:10.960 --> 18:11.949
I'll talk to her.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.530

18:28.710 --> 18:29.779

18:32.040 --> 18:33.576

18:35.880 --> 18:36.915
Ryn.

18:38.670 --> 18:39.739

18:41.750 --> 18:43.570
You're a fast learner.

18:52.750 --> 18:53.819
Ryn?

18:55.620 --> 18:57.747
Yes. Ryn.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.871
Be good to her.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.668
Whoa.

19:14.670 --> 19:15.819
Oh, man.

19:18.670 --> 19:19.785

19:49.080 --> 19:51.116
No. No no no no no.

She is hunter.

Hunter, okay.

20:01.710 --> 20:02.950
This way.
This way out. Go. Go.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.202
I found these a few days ago.

20:07.210 --> 20:09.030
They're from your mother
to my grandmother.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.168
My mother
wrote all of these?

20:17.420 --> 20:19.320
They had
a lot to write about.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.412
Yeah, mostly about
my crazy grandfather.

20:23.420 --> 20:26.457
There's crazy running
all up and down the bloodline.

20:28.250 --> 20:29.490
Sometimes I worry about Ben.

20:34.460 --> 20:37.111
He's just
a young man, Ted,

20:37.120 --> 20:39.327
trying to solve
all the problems
of the world.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.415
Oh, take them.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.490
Read them.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.412
They obviously meant
something to my grandmother.

20:46.420 --> 20:49.071
Hopefully, they'll mean
something to you.

20:52.080 --> 20:56.164
[soft music]

20:56.170 --> 20:57.159
Are you okay?

20:58.500 --> 21:00.206
Confused.

21:00.210 --> 21:01.416
He is different than us.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.286
The best way
to have sex on land

21:04.290 --> 21:06.167
is just
to let it feel good.

21:07.540 --> 21:09.326
Like with us.

21:09.330 --> 21:13.118
Remember when we were
first together,

21:13.120 --> 21:14.246
how we showed you?

21:16.120 --> 21:17.246
Now you show him.

[door unlatches]

21:36.290 --> 21:37.450

Yeah, Ryn will know
what to do.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.569
We don't know him!

22:17.620 --> 22:18.609

22:30.250 --> 22:32.161
I don't like it,
either, okay,

22:32.170 --> 22:33.410
her being someone else.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.240
But we have to put
our feelings aside.

22:37.210 --> 22:38.370
You can do that?

22:41.290 --> 22:42.416
Listen.

22:42.420 --> 22:45.378
[silence]

22:47.620 --> 22:50.453
I told her to show him
how we do it.

a piece of the action.

to figure out what happened,

the military's involved.

Yes. Wow.

They usually do.

you're angry at him.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.615
He lie to me.

27:15.620 --> 27:17.781
He should tell me
about his family.

27:17.790 --> 27:19.610
He was afraid
of losing you.

Yes.

how she was?

The pain she caused me?

27:29.830 --> 27:35.575
Yes.
She was weak and sad.

27:35.580 --> 27:36.786
Am I like her?

27:38.750 --> 27:41.662
No, you are strong.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.663
Just because your family
thinks or acts a certain way

27:46.670 --> 27:48.570
doesn't mean you have
to repeat that.

of what his family did.

don't trust humans.

you trusted us,

or bad.

[coughing]

31:23.120 --> 31:25.953
Yep, that's me.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.030
From water?

31:28.040 --> 31:30.747
No, I'm a city kid.

31:30.750 --> 31:32.786
'Cause now is my time

31:32.790 --> 31:33.825
Now is my time

31:33.830 --> 31:35.741
Are you doing that?

-[hisses]
-Aah! Aah!

31:37.040 --> 31:40.203
Hey, man,
I'll get 40 on the...

31:41.920 --> 31:43.820
Oh, shit.

31:43.830 --> 31:44.956

In. [hisses]

31:47.920 --> 31:49.911
[Chewey choking]

31:51.040 --> 31:53.167
[hisses] Now!

31:53.170 --> 31:55.786
[Chewey, gasping]
What just happened?

31:55.790 --> 31:57.872
You just dodged a bullet.

31:57.880 --> 32:00.781
[groaning]

32:04.210 --> 32:09.739
[Siren song echoing]

32:14.880 --> 32:17.872
[Ryn's voice]
This man in your family.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.075
[song continuing]

32:20.080 --> 32:21.911
His love turned bad.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.031
It makes him angry.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.075
Noo!

32:34.120 --> 32:35.109
Aah!

32:36.830 --> 32:38.115
No!Noo!

32:44.250 --> 32:45.239

[ominous music]

33:25.170 --> 33:26.876
You are okay?

33:30.000 --> 33:33.072
No. Not okay.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.160
Angry with me?

33:35.210 --> 33:37.246
Confused about myself.

33:37.250 --> 33:39.536
Ben,

33:39.540 --> 33:41.610
I know you
would not hurt me.

33:43.330 --> 33:45.491
I know you are different
than your family.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.489
Those who kill.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.377
I want to believe that.

33:49.380 --> 33:50.369
I believe.

33:51.620 --> 33:53.497
Our love is good.

33:56.580 --> 33:58.320
You trust me?

34:00.540 --> 34:02.667
I don't want you
to feel any more pain.

34:31.750 --> 34:34.537
[engine stops]

34:39.620 --> 34:41.417
Happy middle of the night.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.575
It's a long story.

34:51.460 --> 34:52.575
[door unlatches]

34:55.710 --> 34:58.417
Levi? Where?

34:58.420 --> 35:00.285
I don't know.

35:00.290 --> 35:01.416
With him now.

35:11.750 --> 35:12.739
-[hisses]
-[hisses]

35:14.420 --> 35:15.489
Different on land.

35:16.670 --> 35:17.785
No fight.

35:20.330 --> 35:21.376
EquaL

35:23.670 --> 35:24.659
I show you.

35:37.750 --> 35:40.492
So I guess we just--

35:40.500 --> 35:42.661
Yeah. Let them do
what they do.

35:44.750 --> 35:47.321
I'll make sure
they're comfortable.

35:56.790 --> 35:58.451
Yeah.

36:03.620 --> 36:04.609
You okay?

36:05.620 --> 36:07.451
I'm--

36:07.460 --> 36:08.609
I'm just worried

36:08.620 --> 36:09.746
about Nicole.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.490
I been trying
to reach her,

36:11.500 --> 36:13.616
but there's just nothing,
just crickets.

36:17.540 --> 36:18.609
[Ben] You stay
out here and lay low.

36:18.620 --> 36:20.576
I'll get in there.

36:20.580 --> 36:22.741
Think she pulled
an all-nighter?

36:22.750 --> 36:24.615
She would've texted.

36:26.790 --> 36:28.371
I'll find her.

36:29.670 --> 36:31.661
Okay. Be careful.

[suspenseful music]

[Beth] "We have lost him
in the prime of his life,

36:56.580 --> 36:58.457
and it kills me to know
that he'll never meet

36:58.460 --> 37:00.451
our beautiful baby girl."

37:01.580 --> 37:03.457
That's you
she's writing about.

37:08.750 --> 37:09.785
I, um...

37:11.790 --> 37:16.454
I may have been wrong
to blame your people
for the fire.

37:16.460 --> 37:20.783
Yes, it certainly reads
like Caleb Pownall started it.

37:20.790 --> 37:21.870
I don't know.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.609
I may never know.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.667
It was all
before we were born, Helen.

37:27.670 --> 37:28.819
Thank you for sharing this,

37:28.830 --> 37:32.573
and for your apology.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.616
That's not
the only reason I came.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.871
I also came to warn you.

38:32.750 --> 38:33.910

[Helen] My family
has had a burial plot

40:05.080 --> 40:08.959
on a coastal hillside
in Bristol Cove.

40:08.960 --> 40:11.997
I believe the military
raided that graveyard.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.615
Oh, my dear.

40:14.710 --> 40:15.825
Oh, I'm so sorry.

40:15.830 --> 40:17.661
You don't understand, Beth.

40:17.670 --> 40:20.787
That is our family.

40:20.790 --> 40:23.076
If they analyze those bones,

40:25.620 --> 40:26.746
they'll know about us.

40:28.710 --> 40:29.950
They could find us.
