WEBVTT

00:11.928 --> 00:14.806
<i>Station, this is Houston,
are you ready for the event?</i>

00:16.516 --> 00:18.309
<i>Houston,
this is the International Space Station,</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:19.561
<i>we are ready for the event.</i>

00:19.644 --> 00:23.106
<i>Welcome to the Expedition 62/63
Change of Command Ceremony.</i>

00:32.991 --> 00:34.909
We, since there is...

00:35.243 --> 00:38.038
<i>The key is a nice touch.</i>
-...great work...

00:38.163 --> 00:40.206
<i>I really like that tradition.</i>

00:41.166 --> 00:42.500
It's a physical thing

00:42.584 --> 00:45.587
that the previous commander
hands to the new commander,

00:45.795 --> 00:50.467
and it's almost just like this relief.
Okay, I had it, you got it.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.762
It's with great honor and pride
that I take command

00:53.845 --> 00:55.430
of the International Space Station,

00:55.555 --> 00:58.516
we're receiving
the Space Station in great order.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.854
Much thanks to you and the excellent work
of the Expedition 62 crew.

01:03.271 --> 01:06.941
So, on behalf of Expedition 63,

01:07.192 --> 01:09.402
thank you very much and we have the con.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.155
<i>That's what I really like about,</i>

01:12.238 --> 01:15.241
<i>actually physically
taking control of the key.</i>

01:16.576 --> 01:20.205
<i>It's a daily reminder
that you are the commander</i>

01:20.330 --> 01:21.706
<i>of the International Space Station,</i>

01:22.707 --> 01:27.712
<i>and with this key
comes all of the weight of command.</i>

01:59.786 --> 02:02.831
<i>It was the end of this
seven-month mission for me,</i>

02:02.914 --> 02:04.541
<i>nine-month mission for Drew,</i>

02:04.749 --> 02:07.627
<i>during the whole unfolding
of the global pandemic.</i>

02:07.794 --> 02:09.963
And the next human
that we are going to see

02:10.046 --> 02:13.091
was Chris Cassidy,
and his two Russian cosmonaut colleagues.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.801
Learned is not to get in the way of...

02:14.884 --> 02:16.511
<i>We were so excited about this overlap</i>

02:16.594 --> 02:19.806
<i>because it just suddenly
changed the atmosphere.</i>

02:19.889 --> 02:21.057
Hey, guys, what's going on?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.892
<i>And Chris, of course, was...</i>
- Where'd you get those?

02:23.017 --> 02:24.435
<i>-...in the US segment with us...</i>
- I just...

02:24.561 --> 02:28.439
<i>...and Chris was so much fun
on orbit. We had such a great time.</i>

02:28.731 --> 02:30.441
- Okay. Now, we have...

02:30.525 --> 02:33.027
...this is Morgan versus Cassidy,
and I see they've opened their packets,

02:33.111 --> 02:35.446
and they're starting
to eject the pudding.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.282
Oh, and Cassidy's loose, Cassidy's loose.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.992
- Okay, wait, Chris, you can't...

02:39.117 --> 02:40.577
...you can't eat it yet because look...

02:40.827 --> 02:41.828
Go easy.

02:42.579 --> 02:45.206
- Oh, man, I missed it.
- Oh, man.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.083
Let's see what Drew is up to.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.089
He's running on the wall.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.467
<i>Chris of course was a vet,
he knew how to navigate around,</i>

02:56.593 --> 02:58.553
<i>it was a familiar territory for him.</i>

02:59.262 --> 03:02.640
What day is it, Drew?
How many days until undock?

03:03.850 --> 03:04.934
Two days.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.394
Two days?
- Two days to undock.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.980
I'm tryna cram in the workouts.

03:10.565 --> 03:13.026
What are you gonna be doing
in two days, Jessica?

03:13.109 --> 03:16.362
We're gonna be fighting
to stand up against gravity.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.207
Dude, we haven't talked about
AMS EVAs yet.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.417
No. No, we haven't.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.836
We were constantly wondering, like,

03:31.920 --> 03:35.757
"Boy, I hope... I know this is hard
for Chris to watch because he was..."

03:35.882 --> 03:38.343
Because we knew that you were part
of the development from the beginning.

03:38.426 --> 03:42.305
That you had put hours,
and hours of effort and expertise,

03:42.388 --> 03:43.389
into developing it.

03:43.473 --> 03:47.060
And then,
you know, Luca and I,

03:47.143 --> 03:48.895
- two clowns show up.
- Yeah.

03:48.978 --> 03:51.564
We just started working
into the training there at the end,

03:51.648 --> 03:52.649
and then here.

03:52.857 --> 03:56.027
You know, both of us had been
mentored by you over the years,

03:56.110 --> 03:58.488
and now here we were doing it,

03:59.739 --> 04:02.909
and you know, you're on the ground,

04:03.201 --> 04:06.037
- and...
- It was, it was, it was, uh...

04:06.371 --> 04:09.415
You know, I gotta admit
when I realized

04:09.499 --> 04:13.461
that we were switching, before you guys
left Houston, I was kind of like,

04:13.544 --> 04:18.258
"Man, bummer." But I got
quickly past it you know,

04:18.341 --> 04:21.719
and felt really good
about you guys doing it

04:21.844 --> 04:24.264
'cause we all
worked together so much.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.017
<i>And I was just fired up
for you guys to get out there and...</i>

04:28.434 --> 04:29.978
<i>and crank away and get it done.</i>

04:31.396 --> 04:33.231
- Good job.
- It makes me feel a lot better

04:33.356 --> 04:36.150
- knowing you're here.

04:39.487 --> 04:43.032
Okay. It's April 16th, it's departure day,
Jessica and I are packing things up.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.702
Chris is, getting things
squared away in his

04:46.536 --> 04:48.037
- crew quarters.
- My crew quarters.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.082
Getting it all...
- Shipshape.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.459
Shipshape, getting it...
Making it a home.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.420
And Jessica, what are you up to?

04:56.921 --> 04:59.590
Just finishing up
my last organization of my CQ.

04:59.799 --> 05:00.842
All right.

05:02.552 --> 05:06.264
Everybody's there.
It's our last PFC all together.

05:07.056 --> 05:11.352
The hardest part of being up here
was being away from you guys.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.730
But soon I'll be home and we'll be...

05:13.813 --> 05:16.065
I will, I'll be able to
hug and kiss you again.

05:16.524 --> 05:19.277
And things will gradually start
to get back to normal.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.947
We're coming to an end
after nine months. It's hard to believe.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.659
I wanted to let you guys know
that I love you very much.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.412
The two most dangerous
parts of the mission

05:29.495 --> 05:32.582
are the launch and the landing,
but this is a really,

05:32.665 --> 05:34.667
really reliable vehicle
that I'm flying on,

05:34.751 --> 05:36.002
so you don't have to worry about it.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.798
<i>NASA astronauts
Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir</i>

05:40.923 --> 05:43.259
<i>-are preparing for their journey home.</i>
- Talk to you soon.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.886
<i>Chris Cassidy,
the new commander</i>

05:44.969 --> 05:46.512
<i>of the International Space Station,</i>

05:46.596 --> 05:49.307
<i>will stay behind
to live and work on the station</i>

05:49.432 --> 05:52.393
<i>along with Anatoly Ivanishin
and Ivan Vagner.</i>

06:28.221 --> 06:30.765
<i>And the hatch
is now closed on the Soyuz.</i>

06:32.100 --> 06:36.312
<i>Hatch is closed. Copy.
We are starting procedure.</i>

06:41.692 --> 06:43.277
<i>D17, are you ready?</i>

06:43.361 --> 06:45.196
<i>I copy.
Ready.</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:50.785
<i>And we have undocking
of the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft</i>

06:50.868 --> 06:57.834
<i>at 8:53 and 30 seconds p.m. central time.
Soyuz MS-15 and its crew are flying free.</i>

06:57.917 --> 07:00.545
<i>One step closer
on their way back home to Earth.</i>

07:20.356 --> 07:22.817
<i>Being in space
and looking down at the Earth,</i>

07:22.900 --> 07:26.863
<i>it gives you that perspective.
You just... It's forced upon you,</i>

07:27.238 --> 07:31.492
<i>to see how connected everything is.
And especially with the gravity</i>

07:31.576 --> 07:34.412
<i>of everything that was going on
on the planet during our mission.</i>

07:36.247 --> 07:39.876
<i>We had the global pandemic
unfold in front of our very eyes,</i>

07:40.251 --> 07:44.547
<i>and something that was affecting
7.5 billion people on the planet,</i>

07:44.672 --> 07:47.300
<i>and three of us up there in space
not affected by it.</i>

07:47.467 --> 07:50.720
<i>That was really a bit surreal
for us to wrap our heads around.</i>

09:03.876 --> 09:07.380
Okay. First haircut in space.

09:17.181 --> 09:20.476
<i>So Anatoly and Ivan are on
the Russian side of the space station</i>

09:20.560 --> 09:24.939
<i>doing experiments and maintenance
as I’m doing the same thing on our side.</i>

09:26.899 --> 09:29.026
<i>Hey Chris,
if you want some guidance,</i>

09:29.110 --> 09:30.403
<i>we're happy to help you.</i>

09:30.653 --> 09:33.197
Sure. Hi, Sarah
and Sarah. Let's go for it.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.868
BioMole, Swab DNA, Extraction Kit.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.996
<i>If you could just
go ahead and finish</i>

09:40.204 --> 09:42.957
<i>-pipetting these last two samples.
For the past twenty years,</i>

09:43.416 --> 09:45.501
<i>we’ve been monitoring how the human body,</i>

09:45.626 --> 09:50.673
<i>and scientific processes are affected
in space that not only will teach us</i>

09:50.923 --> 09:54.385
<i>how to live in zero gravity,
but how life can be better on Earth.</i>

09:54.677 --> 09:55.678
That’s what it looks like,

09:55.761 --> 09:57.555
with the little plants
growing inside there.

09:57.930 --> 10:02.810
We’re ending the experiment today,
bagging them up for a return to Earth.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.314
Now to the Japanese Experiment Module.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.568
<i>Please release
the handle and open the inner hatch.</i>

10:10.735 --> 10:12.278
Open the inner hatch.

10:13.654 --> 10:14.822
The smell of space.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.367
<i>Just like the shoulders
that we’re standing on,</i>

10:18.576 --> 10:23.456
<i>Apollo, Gemini, and Mercury.
A team of people allowing us to live</i>

10:23.539 --> 10:26.167
<i>for twenty continuous years
onboard the space station.</i>

10:26.959 --> 10:30.379
<i>It's neat to be here,
getting this whole system robust</i>

10:30.463 --> 10:34.300
<i>to the point where the next
generation of explorers can live</i>

10:34.383 --> 10:35.885
<i>normal daily life in space.</i>

10:35.968 --> 10:38.137
<i>Now, go ahead,
and squirt the juice in there.</i>

10:38.220 --> 10:40.890
<i>It’s on to the
next phase of history.</i>

10:41.390 --> 10:43.517
<i>Who knows what that next chapter will be,</i>

10:43.601 --> 10:46.312
<i>but that’s what our crew
will be helping to write.</i>

10:55.029 --> 10:58.574
<i>Testing, hello, everybody,
test, test, test, test, test, test.</i>

10:58.658 --> 11:01.077
<i>Much better, now we can hear ya.</i>

11:01.243 --> 11:02.953
- Are there people there?
<i>Oh, ya.</i>

11:03.037 --> 11:04.705
There are people here...

11:04.789 --> 11:06.165
...you wanna see 'em?

11:06.290 --> 11:07.667
<i>-Hello, everybody.</i>

11:07.750 --> 11:10.002
Yeah!

11:10.211 --> 11:12.838
There we go. Whoo-hoo!

11:13.506 --> 11:16.926
<i>Brownie and I were in Afghanistan
together my second time there,</i>

11:17.009 --> 11:18.678
<i>and we just kind of bonded.</i>

11:19.387 --> 11:20.554
And Peggy's here.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.224
And Peggy's here.
All right! Hey! Hey, babe.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.892
<i>Well, Brownie.</i>

11:24.975 --> 11:26.477
<i>I gotta start out by saying,</i>

11:27.561 --> 11:29.271
not coronavirus,

11:29.355 --> 11:33.401
or not a trip to space could prevent me
from being and sharing this day with you,

11:33.734 --> 11:38.447
so here we go, my friend.
Brownie, would you please repeat after me.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.700
"I take you...

11:40.825 --> 11:42.368
<i>"I take you...</i>

11:42.451 --> 11:45.830
<i>"...to be my constant friend.</i>
"...to be my constant friend.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.458
"To be your faithful partner
in sickness and in health.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.586
"To be your faithful partner
in sickness and in health.

11:53.462 --> 11:56.674
"And to cherish you both
in this life and in the next.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.385
"And cherish you both
in this life and in the next.

12:00.177 --> 12:03.139
<i>"Please put the ring on his finger
and repeat after me.</i>

12:03.848 --> 12:06.726
"I give you this ring
as a token of my promise.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.270
"I give you this ring
as a token of my promise.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.858
<i>"Wear it, think of it,
and know that I love you.</i>

12:13.941 --> 12:16.777
"Wear it, think of me,
and know that I love you.

12:22.283 --> 12:26.412
"By the power invested in me
and by the state of Florida,

12:26.662 --> 12:30.249
"I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You now may kiss the bride!"

12:52.938 --> 12:55.274
<i>During my six month stay
on the space station,</i>

12:55.357 --> 13:00.863
<i>SpaceX's first crewed rocket Demo-2
will attempt to launch on the 27th of May.</i>

13:01.530 --> 13:05.910
<i>Demo-2 will be piloted by NASA astronauts
Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley,</i>

13:05.993 --> 13:07.244
<i>close friends of mine.</i>

13:10.956 --> 13:14.710
<i>For me, you know it started
as a love of flight and airplanes</i>

13:14.877 --> 13:16.086
and an interest in space,

13:16.796 --> 13:18.839
and then I was lucky enough
to get to pursue it,

13:18.923 --> 13:22.718
as a fighter pilot in the Marines
and then as a test pilot.

13:23.886 --> 13:27.097
<i>And was able to get to fly
a space shuttle a couple times as well.</i>

13:27.723 --> 13:32.144
You know, Bob and I are extremely excited
to kind of put Dragon through its paces

13:32.228 --> 13:35.147
in space and get to
the International Space Station again.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.942
And by the way,
this is as excited as Bob gets.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.529
- So, this is... It's gonna be fun.

13:42.530 --> 13:46.450
When they handed us the opportunity,
or selected us to be the test pilots

13:46.784 --> 13:49.245
on the first flight
of the Crew Dragon, it’s just...

13:49.787 --> 13:55.835
You know, you wait multiple careers.
It’s a once in a generational opportunity.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.338
<i>In terms of commentating,
doing the mission coverage,</i>

13:59.463 --> 14:02.216
<i>DM2 will be the biggest thing
I’ve ever done...</i>

14:02.299 --> 14:03.801
- Very excited. We're finally...
...by far.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.262
<i>...sending humans...
It’ll be the first time</i>

14:06.345 --> 14:10.307
<i>we’ve launched people to space
from the US since the shuttle landed.</i>

14:11.267 --> 14:15.938
The ultimate goal is so spaceflight
isn’t just for a government astronaut.

14:16.438 --> 14:19.400
<i>We want spaceflight to be
for as many people as possible,</i>

14:19.775 --> 14:22.027
<i>to make it so
companies are sending people,</i>

14:22.236 --> 14:25.030
and hardware and experiments up there.

14:25.114 --> 14:28.951
And so you have just hopefully
this explosion in the population

14:29.034 --> 14:30.786
of people that have been to outer space.

14:36.792 --> 14:41.338
<i>It's Saturday May 9th,
so that puts us, like,</i>

14:42.590 --> 14:47.344
<i>20 days away
from launching on SpaceX.</i>

14:48.596 --> 14:51.974
I just. I'm really excited,

14:52.516 --> 14:56.312
kind of proud of working
at NASA at this...

14:56.729 --> 15:00.983
at this juncture. The eve, so to speak,
of launching people from Florida again.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.526
<i>It's even more exciting for me</i>

15:02.651 --> 15:05.154
<i>'cause I know the two guys
that are flying in there.</i>

15:05.279 --> 15:08.115
And I'll greet them, there's the hatch...

15:10.159 --> 15:13.203
right down there. Through that hatch,

15:13.495 --> 15:16.957
they'll come through,
and we'll have a welcome ceremony,

15:17.625 --> 15:21.837
and congratulate them, and hug them,
and it's just gonna be really neat.

15:25.799 --> 15:29.261
Hello, my name is Doug Hurley, I'm a major
in the United States Marine Corps,

15:29.803 --> 15:33.474
and I was born and raised
in Apalachin, New York.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.936
And I'm... I was currently
an F-18 test pilot

15:37.019 --> 15:38.437
at Naval Air Station Patuxent River,

15:38.520 --> 15:40.314
and I have a degree
from Tulane University.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.652
Chris has been here
almost as long as I have,

15:44.735 --> 15:46.111
you know, a 20-year career.

15:46.987 --> 15:50.157
I'm Chris Cassidy from York, Maine,
and I'm really motivated

15:50.240 --> 15:52.660
to be part of the NASA team
and participate...

15:52.785 --> 15:54.828
<i>-You never forget your first flight...</i>
There you go.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.831
<i>and we were really lucky
to get to fly together in STS-127.</i>

16:00.000 --> 16:01.335
- Hi, Doug.
- Hey, buddy.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.878
Good config
for the burner I heard.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.129
- Yeah.
You did it. All right.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.673
We're gonna do our first homes burn.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.550
So happy to be here with you guys.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.678
<i>We were first time flyers,
you know...</i>

16:10.761 --> 16:13.138
<i>...we really got thrown
into the fire so to speak,</i>

16:13.222 --> 16:16.225
<i>as far as responsibilities.
One, because I was the pilot,</i>

16:16.308 --> 16:20.479
<i>and the other for Chris
because he was gonna do three spacewalks.</i>

16:20.896 --> 16:25.275
<i>You work so hard to get to that point
where you’re actually on a space mission.</i>

16:25.484 --> 16:27.569
In a sense,
your whole professional career,

16:27.736 --> 16:29.405
you know, leads you to that point.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.951
- Hello, from SpaceX headquarters.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.912
<i>My name is Dan Huot.
We're here for this historic launch</i>

16:37.371 --> 16:39.039
<i>There is our first look in the room.</i>

16:39.123 --> 16:40.833
<i>There's astronaut Doug Hurley.</i>

16:41.125 --> 16:43.752
<i>getting into his spacesuit.
And there's a wider shot,</i>

16:43.877 --> 16:47.256
<i>you can see astronaut Bob Behnken
also in view now.</i>

16:48.090 --> 16:50.426
<i>Today's mission
will be Crew Dragon's first test</i>

16:50.509 --> 16:51.760
with humans on board.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.221
<i>With our partners at SpaceX,</i>

16:54.304 --> 16:58.142
<i>we usher in the commercial crew era
of American spaceflight.</i>

17:00.769 --> 17:03.105
<i>NASA's
original astronauts were test pilots,</i>

17:03.564 --> 17:07.735
<i>and I definitely do feel
a reach back to that era.</i>

17:13.282 --> 17:16.201
<i>And there they are.</i>

17:20.080 --> 17:23.459
<i>This is the beginning
of this next era of space exploration.</i>

17:24.376 --> 17:26.003
<i>You can see some clouds starting</i>

17:26.086 --> 17:28.380
<i>to gather over launch complex 39A.</i>

17:32.426 --> 17:34.928
<i>Weather operators
are about to kick off their final checks</i>

17:35.012 --> 17:37.973
- on wind speeds at the pad.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.102
<i>We are currently no go
on launch weather.</i>

17:43.187 --> 17:44.396
<i>They have insight...</i>
- In one minute,

17:44.480 --> 17:46.690
we're directly over to JSC.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.110
Going to get the picture in more.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.033
<i>We were able to get
a couple of images down</i>

17:56.158 --> 17:59.953
<i>from the current Expedition 63
Commander Chris Cassidy.</i>

18:00.079 --> 18:04.041
<i>This picture is of that pad
at the Kennedy Space Center</i>

18:04.166 --> 18:08.837
<i>with Bob and Doug still on the launch pad.
Eagle eye for Chris Cassidy to snap these.</i>

18:09.546 --> 18:12.174
Great pictures.
Right over the pad. Come on.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.219
<i>Dragon launch director
at CAPCOM 1, comm check.</i>

18:15.677 --> 18:17.930
Good afternoon, Mike, loud and clear.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.265
<i>I have you the same,
man, good afternoon.</i>

18:20.390 --> 18:21.892
<i>This weather is go
at this time.</i>

18:22.309 --> 18:24.019
Dragon copy, go weather.

18:25.145 --> 18:29.358
<i>Dragon SpaceX, go for launch.</i>
- Yeah! Get some!

18:29.942 --> 18:31.193
<i>Bob, Doug,</i>

18:31.276 --> 18:33.737
<i>know that we're with you,
have an amazing flight,</i>

18:33.862 --> 18:36.031
<i>and enjoy those views
of our beautiful planet.</i>

18:36.532 --> 18:37.991
<i>T-minus 15 seconds.</i>

18:38.951 --> 18:40.160
<i>SpaceX Dragon.</i>

18:40.327 --> 18:42.329
<i>We're go for launch.
Let's light this candle.</i>

18:42.496 --> 18:43.539
Here we go.

18:43.914 --> 18:50.087
<i>Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.</i>

19:10.566 --> 19:12.442
<i>America has launched!</i>

19:12.526 --> 19:16.029
<i>And so rises a new era
of American spaceflight,</i>

19:16.113 --> 19:19.992
<i>and with it the ambitions
of a new generation continuing the dream.</i>

19:20.868 --> 19:23.162
<i>Twenty seconds
into flight stage propulsion,</i>

19:23.245 --> 19:25.455
<i>-it is nominal.</i>
- Here we go. We're going to the cupola.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.797
<i>SpaceX Dragon, on the big loop</i>

19:33.881 --> 19:37.634
<i>for the handling qualities.
It flew really well, very crisp.</i>

19:37.718 --> 19:41.597
<i>So my congratulations
to the folks in Hawthorne.</i>

19:51.773 --> 19:56.320
There they are. That's what?
Two-hundred meters from the Space Station.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.785
<i>Houston and Station
are now go for docking.</i>

20:06.246 --> 20:09.333
<i>Dragon SpaceX
docking sequence is complete.</i>

20:19.134 --> 20:21.929
<i>The crew of Expedition 63
is honored to welcome Dragon,</i>

20:22.054 --> 20:23.805
<i>and the commercial crew program.</i>

20:23.889 --> 20:25.807
<i>Welcome aboard
the International Space Station.</i>

20:25.891 --> 20:28.852
<i>Bob and Doug, I'm glad to have you
as part of the crew, welcome.</i>

20:29.519 --> 20:32.397
- Thank you, Chris.
- We have a Dragon.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.358
Yeah!

20:36.151 --> 20:37.236
What's up, dawgs?

20:37.361 --> 20:40.155
How you doing?
- How you doing?

20:41.573 --> 20:44.826
Hello.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.788
I don't know if I got a good angle here?

20:47.871 --> 20:49.998
- You got it, what's going on?
- All right.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.541
- Great to see you.
- Great to see you, buddy.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.293
- Thank you.
- Yup, welcome aboard.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.463
- Great to see you.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.048
Watch your head.
- Great to see you.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.050
Watch your head.
Nice to see you. Great job.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.176
How are ya?

21:01.593 --> 21:04.221
- Good to be back.
- Welcome.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.860
This the new dress code?
Now that you're the boss man.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.613
Leaving NASA, like...

21:23.282 --> 21:25.367
It's a hard place to leave.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.660
- Right?
Yeah.

21:26.743 --> 21:31.623
I mean, I spent, up until now,
my entire professional career at NASA.

21:31.748 --> 21:32.749
Where are you headed?

21:32.874 --> 21:35.502
Yeah, so I’m going over
to Intuitive Machines,

21:35.836 --> 21:40.716
and they’ve won several contracts
for delivering hardware to the moon.

21:40.841 --> 21:44.094
We've actually got our first mission
at the end of this year.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.306
Where we're building a Lunar Lander,

21:47.931 --> 21:52.019
and it's going to launch
on a Falcon 9, a SpaceX rocket,

21:52.644 --> 21:54.855
and go land on the moon.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.567
Go straight to the moon.
I mean, what else is there to do?

21:58.650 --> 22:02.696
The chance to do something
totally new, you know,

22:02.779 --> 22:05.741
that nobody’s ever done commercially...

22:07.659 --> 22:09.077
it’s exciting stuff.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.413
The end of an era.
Truly, the end of an era.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.332
So it’s a little bittersweet to see it go.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.751
Yeah. Yeah, it sure is.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.629
<i>For the AMS spacewalks,
I was Brian Mader's apprentice.</i>

22:19.921 --> 22:23.550
<i>He showed me how to design
and plan and build a spacewalk.</i>

22:24.217 --> 22:27.971
<i>And in fact, I have a junior person
that I'm training in a similar fashion,</i>

22:28.055 --> 22:30.140
<i>so really, the torch has been passed.</i>

22:31.433 --> 22:34.144
We are getting ready
to do some battery EVAs,

22:34.895 --> 22:36.229
spacewalks up on Station.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.441
Actually, Chris Cassidy
is gonna be helping us out with those.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.402
So, yeah, the guy likes them
and we certainly like

22:42.486 --> 22:45.822
when he does our spacewalks.
They get done well, and get done quickly.

22:45.906 --> 22:46.948
He makes it look easy.

22:47.074 --> 22:50.827
I'm so glad to not only have him up there
and doing spacewalks, but like,

22:50.952 --> 22:53.747
getting to work with him, you know.
Getting to kinda do it with him.

22:57.542 --> 23:02.339
<i>On these spacewalks,
we’re replacing older-generation batteries</i>

23:02.422 --> 23:04.091
<i>with new generation batteries.</i>

23:07.302 --> 23:10.680
<i>We’re generating electricity
with our solar arrays.</i>

23:11.932 --> 23:14.810
<i>For 45 minutes of the orbit,
we’re charging those batteries,</i>

23:14.935 --> 23:17.562
and then we’re depleting the batteries
in the dark side of the orbit,

23:17.646 --> 23:20.023
<i>and just continue to do that,
sixteen orbits a day.</i>

23:20.982 --> 23:24.569
<i>They’re put through a lot of stress.
Eventually, the battery's gonna give out,</i>

23:24.861 --> 23:28.031
<i>and then you’re without electricity
for half of the orbit,</i>

23:28.115 --> 23:29.783
<i>and that’s not a place you want to be.</i>

23:31.785 --> 23:35.622
<i>We call the days leading
up to the spacewalk, A Road to EVA.</i>

23:37.541 --> 23:40.919
- Okay. This is always the fun part.
Yeah.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.799
All right. Bob, mini workstation...

23:45.924 --> 23:49.010
<i>You're given time
on the calendar to review the procedure,</i>

23:49.094 --> 23:51.638
<i>and choreograph your moves,
you and your buddy.</i>

23:51.930 --> 23:53.515
- Small...
To a BGT...

23:53.598 --> 23:55.142
...to BGT number two.

23:55.392 --> 23:59.896
Waiting for two minutes,
and then taking the fan switch to "off".

24:00.147 --> 24:02.399
<i>But it all hits the night before.</i>

24:03.817 --> 24:06.153
<i>It's something that your doctor
has talked to you about</i>

24:06.278 --> 24:10.949
<i>because it is very common for people
not to sleep well or at all.</i>

24:12.159 --> 24:13.785
<i>Hey, Chris,
once you get that cap on,</i>

24:13.910 --> 24:16.329
<i>-we recommend our 618 and 619...
You cannot unlock the rack,</i>

24:16.455 --> 24:19.124
<i>-and remove the battery...
...or 618 and 671.</i>

24:19.249 --> 24:20.584
<i>-and the cap.
...and proceed...</i>

24:20.667 --> 24:23.378
<i>You're going in your head
all of the things you gotta do,</i>

24:23.462 --> 24:25.088
<i>don't forget to do that,
don't forget to do...</i>

24:25.172 --> 24:27.048
<i>Fairly thoroughly.
We're P1 and P2r.</i>

24:27.132 --> 24:30.844
<i>To not sleep the night before
is a bad idea because it is a long day.</i>

24:30.969 --> 24:32.846
<i>Okay. Sun going down.</i>

24:47.819 --> 24:49.696
<i>As soon as you wake up it's EVA day.</i>

24:51.072 --> 24:53.325
- You sleep okay, Chris?
- I did, yeah.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.035
Me, too.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.622
<i>You grab a cup of coffee,
and you get some food.</i>

24:59.748 --> 25:03.251
But other than that,
you're immediately into EVA prep.

25:19.226 --> 25:23.480
<i>I’m getting goosebumps right now,
just because it’s real.</i>

25:27.150 --> 25:28.985
<i>Hey, Chris,
comm check, can you hear me?</i>

25:29.069 --> 25:30.070
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

25:30.487 --> 25:33.615
<i>Airlock Houston,
good morning. Chris and Bob, good morning.</i>

25:34.407 --> 25:35.992
<i>Good morning.
Good morning.</i>

25:36.535 --> 25:39.371
<i>Complete for EV2.
EV1 complete as well.</i>

25:40.580 --> 25:42.165
<i>Good luck guys, have fun.</i>

25:42.249 --> 25:43.792
<i>Thanks, Doug.
Thanks a lot.</i>

25:54.010 --> 25:56.263
<i>My last spacewalk
was seven years ago,</i>

25:58.139 --> 26:00.141
<i>so I've thought a lot about this moment.</i>

26:02.435 --> 26:05.480
<i>In the Navy, we say sailors
are meant to be at sea.</i>

26:05.564 --> 26:09.109
<i>I feel that way about astronauts.
Astronauts are meant to be in space.</i>

26:10.610 --> 26:16.157
<i>We are astronauts to fulfill that desire
to explore and do the mission.</i>

26:25.625 --> 26:28.169
<i>Nothing can prepare you
for when you’re out there</i>

26:28.336 --> 26:30.255
<i>and experiencing it, and feeling it.</i>

26:31.172 --> 26:34.175
<i>And your heartbeat
is thumping inside your spacesuit,</i>

26:34.259 --> 26:37.262
<i>and you’re seeing the ground go by.</i>

26:41.600 --> 26:46.438
<i>Chris,
you're looking for handrail 7325.</i>

26:46.605 --> 26:50.442
<i>It's adjacent to battery alpha.
You'll stow the ORU bag there.</i>

26:50.900 --> 26:53.612
<i>For EVAs, typically you send
one person out the door</i>

26:53.737 --> 26:55.488
<i>that is an experienced person,</i>

26:55.572 --> 26:58.158
<i>and the other person
is typically less experienced.</i>

26:58.283 --> 27:00.869
That's how we train people,
that's how we get people experienced.

27:06.875 --> 27:10.754
<i>With Chris and Bob,
they're both heavily experienced</i>

27:10.962 --> 27:12.547
<i>EVA crew members.</i>

27:13.089 --> 27:17.510
<i>And so this is an ultimate
Hall of Fame type team.</i>

27:18.011 --> 27:19.054
<i>And for your essay,</i>

27:19.220 --> 27:22.349
<i>the battery you just installed
has good check-outs.</i>

27:58.551 --> 28:01.805
<i>For an update,
you are four hours into the EVA,</i>

28:02.180 --> 28:05.016
<i>and you're about
two hours ahead on the timeline.</i>

28:05.892 --> 28:08.353
<i>It’s a passion
and I love the satisfaction</i>

28:08.436 --> 28:12.524
<i>of working as a team
with your buddy outside,</i>

28:12.607 --> 28:14.651
<i>and your buddies down on the ground.</i>

28:16.778 --> 28:21.282
<i>It was way ahead of schedule.
They just breezed through everything.</i>

28:22.534 --> 28:26.830
It was like watching a masterpiece unfold.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.219
<i>When you and your partner
are kind of moving along.</i>

28:42.470 --> 28:45.807
<i>He could tell when I was ready to grab,
I could tell when he was ready to grab.</i>

28:46.599 --> 28:50.603
<i>When you’re really in sync, it certainly
is a bit of a ballet when it’s happening.</i>

29:17.964 --> 29:20.383
<i>Copy and big picture with that,</i>

29:20.467 --> 29:23.970
<i>we're done with the install,
and we're gonna move into clean up.</i>

29:44.949 --> 29:46.826
<i>And we just got that go Chris,</i>

29:46.910 --> 29:48.828
<i>you can start heading towards the airlock.</i>

30:21.861 --> 30:24.155
I'll turn you over to Doug.
Thank you for the work.

30:40.296 --> 30:41.297
<i>With Chris,</i>

30:41.798 --> 30:45.552
<i>to be able to do four EVAs
with Bob and knock it out of the park,</i>

30:45.677 --> 30:50.932
<i>and then get your individual tally
up to ten spacewalks is, yeah,</i>

30:51.307 --> 30:54.561
<i>if I was gonna script it that's probably
how I would do it if it were me.</i>

30:55.478 --> 30:59.899
<i>If it's my last mission that I ever
fly in space I'll be a very happy camper</i>

31:00.024 --> 31:02.735
<i>'cause it was just a really,
really special time.</i>

31:06.739 --> 31:08.491
<i>Thanks, buddy.
See you.</i>

31:08.825 --> 31:10.034
<i>You guys were great.</i>

31:15.081 --> 31:19.335
See you guys. Take care. Good luck.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.425
<i>Dragon departing.</i>

31:26.801 --> 31:29.512
<i>Dragon, SpaceX. Separation confirmed.</i>

31:31.180 --> 31:33.099
<i>Chris we just
can’t thank you enough.</i>

31:33.182 --> 31:36.519
<i>It’s been an honor and a privilege
to be part of Expedition 63.</i>

31:37.604 --> 31:38.938
<i>It’s been a great two months,</i>

31:39.022 --> 31:42.567
<i>and we appreciate
all you’ve done to help us,</i>

31:42.942 --> 31:45.445
<i>prove out Dragon on its maiden flight.</i>

31:47.530 --> 31:49.657
<i>And with that,
Bob and Doug have concluded their stay</i>

31:49.741 --> 31:52.994
<i>aboard the International Space Station.
They’re on their way back to planet Earth.</i>

31:54.370 --> 31:58.625
<i>To spend two months
on the International Space Station</i>

31:58.708 --> 32:02.587
<i>with the one of the greatest officers,</i>

32:02.795 --> 32:05.048
crewmates, astronauts, Chris Cassidy,

32:05.173 --> 32:07.967
just was a real pleasure for both of us.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.053
And I'm sure Bob will talk about

32:10.178 --> 32:12.805
the spacewalks, but just
to see those two work,

32:13.222 --> 32:15.683
out on the International Space Station,

32:16.142 --> 32:17.769
you're not gonna
see anything like that again.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.563
It was just amazing to be part of that.

32:30.740 --> 32:36.037
Just kind of soaking it all in,
and reflecting on Earth,

32:36.120 --> 32:40.541
reflecting on where we are,
realizing how fortunate,

32:41.918 --> 32:43.878
we are to be here as astronauts.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.508
<i>I was thinking about my dad.</i>

32:49.759 --> 32:53.137
<i>He saw the first two missions
and loved following along,</i>

32:53.262 --> 32:56.182
and he would be doing the same thing
right now if he could.

32:58.768 --> 33:01.437
<i>One of the planets
was shining really brightly.</i>

33:03.481 --> 33:06.609
<i>Distinct amongst
all the blackness of space.</i>

33:08.653 --> 33:12.198
<i>It just made me feel like
he was out there somewhere,</i>

33:12.490 --> 33:13.783
<i>watching over the mission.</i>

33:16.411 --> 33:19.831
<i>He was a man
who was much better</i>

33:20.498 --> 33:22.917
<i>at talking about his feelings than I am.</i>

33:23.001 --> 33:25.461
<i>I tend to sort of hold my feelings in,</i>

33:26.546 --> 33:29.882
<i>and he taught me that letting your</i>

33:31.134 --> 33:33.094
<i>feelings be known is a healthy thing.</i>

33:34.762 --> 33:38.933
<i>I've been in the Navy,
and the government for 28 years,</i>

33:39.267 --> 33:43.021
<i>and got to do some really cool stuff</i>

33:43.104 --> 33:44.897
<i>in the SEAL teams and here at NASA.</i>

33:45.106 --> 33:50.278
<i>None of it I take for granted, you know,
and every bit of it has been special.</i>

33:51.112 --> 33:52.780
<i>It's sometimes hard to believe.</i>

33:53.072 --> 33:55.616
<i>Almost like,
"Did I really live that life?"</i>

33:57.285 --> 34:01.080
<i>I never really thought, "Oh, I'm putting
my life on the line for my mission."</i>

34:01.247 --> 34:03.750
<i>My family of course thought that way.</i>

34:04.459 --> 34:08.671
<i>I was really focused on,
"Okay, what’s next? What’s our mission?</i>

34:08.755 --> 34:12.467
<i>How can we execute that?"
You’re just kind of waiting</i>

34:12.550 --> 34:14.844
<i>for the mission to pull you
in different directions.</i>

34:15.553 --> 34:20.349
<i>The biggest challenge for me right now
is just not feeling like I have control</i>

34:20.433 --> 34:26.189
<i>of my own timeframe, my own life.
I’m starting to think about what’s next.</i>

34:29.150 --> 34:32.862
<i>So it's, let's see, 7:45 at night.</i>

34:33.654 --> 34:36.657
<i>My last few minutes on the space station.</i>

34:40.369 --> 34:42.371
Gonna take one final stroll...

34:44.040 --> 34:45.166
through the modules.

34:48.836 --> 34:49.879
Take care, buddy.

34:51.923 --> 34:52.965
There's Kate.

34:54.884 --> 34:57.470
Oh, there's Sergey, ready to go.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.240
I've got it.

35:17.323 --> 35:18.491
See you.
All right.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.743
Okay.

35:37.176 --> 35:38.511
<i>Good evening and welcome</i>

35:38.636 --> 35:40.721
<i>to the International Space Station
Flight Control Room.</i>

35:40.805 --> 35:44.183
<i>The MS-16 Soyuz is currently
still docked to the Russian Poisk module</i>

35:44.267 --> 35:46.936
<i>of the International Space Station,
but not for long.</i>

35:47.895 --> 35:51.149
<i>We are standing by
for start the activation.</i>

35:51.315 --> 35:54.068
<i>Undocking.
We're right on time at 6:32 p.m.,</i>

35:54.152 --> 35:55.611
<i>-since the station are...</i>
There you go.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.738
<i>-...are 263 miles above the ground...</i>
There they go, see?

35:57.822 --> 36:00.158
<i>There you see. Undocking.
Oh, wow.</i>

36:01.742 --> 36:05.204
<i>Obviously, one of the two
scariest parts of a mission,</i>

36:05.538 --> 36:07.248
<i>the takeoff and the landing.</i>

36:07.373 --> 36:10.168
Your heart pounds.
You never get over that.

36:10.626 --> 36:13.713
<i>With his landing
coming up at 9:55 p.m. central today,</i>

36:13.796 --> 36:16.966
<i>Cassidy will have spent a total
of three hundred and seventy-eight days</i>

36:17.049 --> 36:21.304
<i>in space over his three space missions,
putting him at fifth place</i>

36:21.387 --> 36:24.265
<i>on the list of most time spent
in space by a US astronaut.</i>

36:28.895 --> 36:32.023
<i>You know, you say goodbye
to your crewmates, get in the Soyuz.</i>

36:32.356 --> 36:36.194
<i>From that moment until touchdown
is about five and a half, six hours.</i>

36:38.779 --> 36:43.659
<i>Getting the re-entry angle right
is a critical part of the equation.</i>

36:44.493 --> 36:47.496
<i>If you have a too steep of an angle,
the heat will be too hot,</i>

36:47.747 --> 36:49.707
<i>and the equipment
and the people aren't gonna make it.</i>

36:50.791 --> 36:54.253
<i>If you take it too shallow,
you might potentially</i>

36:54.337 --> 36:55.504
<i>skip off the atmosphere,</i>

36:55.588 --> 36:59.342
<i>and have the rest of your life to think
about what you did wrong.</i>

37:01.219 --> 37:06.891
We just want him to get down safely,
and be back here on Earth with us. Yeah.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.234
<i>We get to this point
called the deorbit burn.</i>

37:17.818 --> 37:22.323
<i>And from there until the ground,
it's just a lot of stuff happening.</i>

37:24.408 --> 37:26.869
<i>You start impacting the atmosphere.</i>

37:33.209 --> 37:35.503
<i>The G-force pushing you into your seat,</i>

37:35.586 --> 37:38.130
<i>three times the force of gravity.</i>

37:40.007 --> 37:42.093
<i>It's difficult to lift your arms up,</i>

37:42.176 --> 37:46.097
<i>difficult to lift your head,
a little hard to breathe.</i>

37:48.391 --> 37:51.727
<i>It feels like the whole thing
is tumbling out of control.</i>

37:53.396 --> 37:56.649
<i>You lose contact. You can't talk
to the ground, they can't talk to you.</i>

38:06.867 --> 38:08.619
<i>As the Soyuz
makes its way back towards earth,</i>

38:08.744 --> 38:10.830
<i>the parachutes will jettison,
and make way</i>

38:10.913 --> 38:14.166
<i>for the 3,281-foot main parachute,</i>

38:14.250 --> 38:17.503
<i>which slows the Soyuz down
to about 15.6 miles per hour.</i>

38:32.393 --> 38:34.228
Just wanted to say hi everyone.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.314
- Hi, Pegg.
Cool.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.274
Chloe in the back.

38:50.411 --> 38:53.122
<i>No video yet,
so we are relying on reports.</i>

38:53.205 --> 38:55.916
<i>from the landing team
who is gathering at the landing site.</i>

39:03.966 --> 39:07.428
Yeah. This is maddening,
normally you see them.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.390
This is taking longer
than it normally would.

39:14.727 --> 39:17.355
Come on, I hope everything's okay.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.485
<i>It's just very nerve racking.</i>

39:22.651 --> 39:26.989
It's like holding your breath
until they're safely on the ground.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.993
We don’t have
audio connections

39:31.077 --> 39:32.661
<i>with the crew at the moment.</i>

39:36.332 --> 39:39.418
<i>All parameters are nominal.</i>

39:39.543 --> 39:41.629
<i>The combined propulsion systems...</i>

39:46.509 --> 39:49.762
<i>it's 4519 meters.</i>

39:49.845 --> 39:52.014
<i>Dean's here
on the ground hearing from the forces,</i>

39:52.098 --> 39:55.768
<i>that the landing team that is
gathering at the landing site,</i>

39:55.851 --> 39:57.520
<i>that one of them does now have
the crew in sight...</i>

39:57.645 --> 39:58.854
There it is.
Here we go.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.606
<i>...and everything is looking nominal.</i>

40:02.775 --> 40:06.278
- Oh, hallelujah.

40:08.531 --> 40:09.698
Oh, wow.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.494
<i>Oh, there we go.</i>

40:15.037 --> 40:17.289
<i>Coming down, coming down,
he's almost there.</i>

40:17.456 --> 40:20.418
<i>The ignition will prepare
to fire six solid propellant engines,</i>

40:20.501 --> 40:24.672
<i>and slow the Soyuz down to five feet
per second, or about 3.5 miles per hour.</i>

40:24.922 --> 40:28.884
<i>Bingo!
Touchdown.</i>

40:30.219 --> 40:33.597
- Touchdown. Yay!

40:33.931 --> 40:37.101
<i>And you can see,
Soyuz has now touched down in Kazakhstan.</i>

40:37.268 --> 40:41.439
<i>-9:54 p.m. central time.
Look at the cloud of dust.</i>

40:41.522 --> 40:47.319
<i>After 196 days in space,
3,136 orbits, and 83 million miles,</i>

40:47.403 --> 40:50.489
<i>Chris Cassidy, Anatoly Ivanishin,
and Ivan Vagner are home.</i>

40:53.492 --> 40:55.327
<i>That is awesome.
Welcome home, Chris!</i>

40:58.664 --> 40:59.957
- That's Chris.
Yeah.

41:03.544 --> 41:08.007
Oh, look. He looks great.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.303
Whoo!

41:24.732 --> 41:27.735
All right.
Let's move out of the way here.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.655
How does it feel, brother?

41:33.157 --> 41:34.200
Never gets old, man.

41:51.800 --> 41:56.055
<i>Thursday night, we went out
to Ellington Field and watched him land.</i>

42:43.352 --> 42:46.105
<i>Harder than
the six months being separated</i>

42:46.230 --> 42:48.357
<i>was the two weeks of quarantine</i>

42:48.482 --> 42:52.486
<i>after I got home and couldn’t be
with Peggy and my family.</i>

42:55.573 --> 43:00.744
<i>So I have medical tests,
blood work, MRI exams.</i>

43:01.870 --> 43:05.249
<i>Scanning your body and bones and balance.</i>

43:06.041 --> 43:08.377
<i>All working really, really well,</i>

43:08.460 --> 43:12.423
it's been what,
a week, ten days, nine days.

43:13.173 --> 43:17.011
<i>Two hours of rehab
every single day in the gym.</i>

43:18.178 --> 43:21.765
<i>And Wednesday
is the official day when it’s all over.</i>

43:35.571 --> 43:36.780
All right, babe.

43:38.824 --> 43:41.160
- Can you feel that thing?
- Oh, yeah, big time.

43:49.585 --> 43:50.628
My guy.

43:51.670 --> 43:53.422
<i>You just can't beat coming home.</i>

44:06.894 --> 44:10.439
<i>It feels so awesome to have,
like, just the sun shining.</i>

44:10.648 --> 44:12.816
One of the things you notice
when people come back from space

44:12.900 --> 44:13.901
is they’re all pale.

44:14.276 --> 44:16.570
We haven’t really been exposed
to the sun for six months,

44:16.695 --> 44:21.241
and so I’m just happy
to be standing beneath it.

44:22.743 --> 44:24.411
I'm surprised
the water isn't colder.

44:26.038 --> 44:28.082
It's a nice temperature.
It is nice.

44:28.916 --> 44:32.670
I just love being on the ocean
and the smell of it.

44:33.128 --> 44:36.298
That’s one thing
we don’t have in space is the smells.

44:38.467 --> 44:43.263
<i>In hindsight of this whole mission,
with being the only US crew member</i>

44:43.347 --> 44:47.142
<i>there for most of the time,
welcoming Bob and Doug and SpaceX,</i>

44:47.267 --> 44:51.647
<i>and then being part of four spacewalks,
it made me realize, like, it all...</i>

44:51.730 --> 44:53.232
<i>Everything works out for a reason.</i>

44:53.357 --> 44:55.567
<i>Like, I was supposed
to be on this mission.</i>

44:55.734 --> 44:58.696
<i>I was supposed to be
right here at this time.</i>

45:19.633 --> 45:21.343
Drew. What's up, dude?

45:22.428 --> 45:23.887
How are you? You look good.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.347
- Good to see you, man.
You, too.

45:26.181 --> 45:28.892
Man, it seems like
it's been forever since I've seen you.

45:28.976 --> 45:30.144
Yeah.

45:30.352 --> 45:31.812
Good haircut.
Yeah, you too.

45:31.895 --> 45:34.022
- You look like you're ready for...
It could be tighter, though.

45:36.608 --> 45:38.569
Yeah, so I've been back

45:38.694 --> 45:40.988
from the space station
for a little while, so,

45:42.322 --> 45:45.075
just gotta figure out what's next in life.

45:45.451 --> 45:48.537
It's the favorite subject
of anybody on the last

45:48.954 --> 45:50.080
couple weeks of a mission, right?

45:50.164 --> 45:51.582
Right.
- When you're up there, you're like,

45:51.665 --> 45:53.459
"Oh, my God, what am I
gonna do when I get back?"

45:53.584 --> 45:57.045
But I've made the decision
to retire from NASA.

45:57.254 --> 46:00.549
And that's...
It's hard for me to say that, you know.

46:00.674 --> 46:03.177
I've been 17 years
of my life as an astronaut,

46:03.260 --> 46:06.096
and had amazing experiences.

46:06.680 --> 46:09.224
And part of me doesn't wanna let that go.

46:09.308 --> 46:15.314
But it's also, having been in management,
I know that there's a time,

46:15.397 --> 46:17.941
and I think now is a good time for me

46:18.025 --> 46:20.652
to move on
and allow the next generation...

46:21.320 --> 46:24.740
to sort of pick it up,
and that's where you are and...

46:25.282 --> 46:28.535
You know, you’re kind of
mid-career right now

46:28.619 --> 46:29.912
with a ton of experience, and...

46:31.121 --> 46:33.791
it’ll be great to see
whatever happens, whatever you’re...

46:33.874 --> 46:37.127
You know, as astronauts we never know
when our last mission is, right? Like...

46:37.628 --> 46:40.923
We're, like, at this...
I've just heard it described many times

46:41.006 --> 46:45.469
as an inflection point in space history,
where we have all these exciting things

46:45.552 --> 46:48.263
going at once.
And then there's the Artemis program,

46:48.388 --> 46:51.600
and of course that would be very exciting.

46:51.725 --> 46:53.519
It's still a number of years away,

46:53.644 --> 46:56.021
and... but I mean, I think it's...

46:57.272 --> 46:58.857
in my career lifetime.

47:00.234 --> 47:03.278
So, yeah, I think about that.
But I don't wanna think about it too much.

47:03.403 --> 47:05.906
Those missions will be few
and far between, but it's...

47:06.156 --> 47:07.991
That's pretty exciting
to be a part of that.

47:08.325 --> 47:11.411
Well, man, it's been great
having this opportunity to sit down.

47:12.371 --> 47:14.331
We haven’t seen each other
since I got back,

47:14.414 --> 47:18.126
so it was just really, really cool
to spend some time with you today.

47:58.584 --> 48:00.919
<i>It feels like
we are at a crossroad right now...</i>

48:03.589 --> 48:07.009
<i>and wherever I look,
there are opportunities and things to do.</i>

48:07.509 --> 48:11.555
Right now, I'm in the team
that is designing Gateway.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.683
Which is the habitat
that will go around the moon.

48:16.226 --> 48:18.896
<i>Once the habitat is made
and done and is in orbit,</i>

48:19.897 --> 48:24.318
<i>to be 100 percent honest
it will be less important that I go.</i>

48:26.653 --> 48:30.198
<i>But if it's my destiny to fly
into the habitat and to test</i>

48:30.365 --> 48:34.411
what we are building right now
and to open the road for future explorers,

48:34.912 --> 48:37.164
then, hey, and dreaming is still legal,

48:37.247 --> 48:41.084
and I think it's actually very,
very, very important to keep doing it.

48:44.838 --> 48:47.382
<i>So we are gonna try and land</i>

48:48.258 --> 48:51.887
<i>where the bottom of the light
touches the dark.</i>

48:53.013 --> 48:54.890
- You'll be...
- Remember my 56th birthday.

48:54.973 --> 48:56.308
56th birthday, that's right.

48:56.433 --> 48:58.518
We're gonna take you to the moon
for your 56th birthday.

49:00.520 --> 49:03.857
<i>I'm wildly excited
about being a part of Artemis.</i>

49:05.400 --> 49:08.862
Something my team's gonna be making,
something I'm going to physically touch

49:08.987 --> 49:11.031
is going to end up
on the surface of the moon,

49:11.156 --> 49:12.366
touching moon dust.

49:13.909 --> 49:15.953
I don't even know
how to put that excitement in words.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.456
<i>I think everyone in the office</i>

49:19.957 --> 49:22.668
<i>would love to be sitting
in the flight director chair,</i>

49:22.751 --> 49:25.087
<i>when the first woman
and next man set foot on the moon.</i>

49:26.630 --> 49:30.050
I think I probably
came along a little too early

49:30.133 --> 49:32.219
to be the person
who gets to sit in that chair,

49:32.302 --> 49:35.222
but I intend to be in the building.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.105
Jessica Meir.

49:43.939 --> 49:47.150
<i>People ask me all the time,
"Oh, so, you're gonna be the first</i>

49:47.275 --> 49:49.903
woman on the moon.
And how does it feel to know that?"

49:49.987 --> 49:53.865
You know, certainly not something I know,
we don't know who that person will be yet.

49:54.157 --> 49:58.704
<i>But to think that I probably know,
and am a close friend or colleague</i>

49:58.870 --> 50:01.707
<i>with one of these people
that will be the one going back</i>

50:01.832 --> 50:04.459
<i>to the moon, that is incredibly exciting.</i>

50:05.460 --> 50:07.254
Jessica Watkins.

50:07.629 --> 50:10.340
<i>I think that it's important
for a woman to go to the moon</i>

50:10.549 --> 50:12.926
because human space flight is for all.

50:13.135 --> 50:17.639
And I hope that there are young kids,
young girls, young girls of color

50:17.723 --> 50:20.892
that are able to see themselves
in a role like this.

50:25.439 --> 50:26.690
I wanna get us to Mars.

50:27.065 --> 50:29.234
That's there since I was a kid.

50:30.944 --> 50:32.195
<i>I’m working on VASIMR.</i>

50:33.572 --> 50:34.906
<i>It's a plasma rocket...</i>

50:35.866 --> 50:40.162
<i>and it's a very viable method
to get us to Mars a whole lot quicker.</i>

50:41.455 --> 50:44.833
That's something
I’d like to do before I retire.

50:46.960 --> 50:51.214
<i>I really have loved my time
at NASA and as an astronaut,</i>

50:51.339 --> 50:54.426
<i>and life will just unfold.</i>

50:56.970 --> 51:00.932
<i>Now, I don't know what the next
opportunity is going to be</i>

51:01.058 --> 51:02.601
<i>as I step into the world...</i>

51:06.772 --> 51:08.774
<i>but it never stops being exciting.</i>
