WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:01.081
I'm leaving.

00:01.157 --> 00:02.181
What?

00:02.258 --> 00:05.421
You're not gonna have Thomas
Magnum to kick around anymore.

00:09.198 --> 00:10.222
Oops.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.632
I cannot quarterback
a pro football team.

00:12.702 --> 00:13.828
Oh, sure you can.

00:13.903 --> 00:15.734
You could be my roomie.
It's perfect cover.

00:15.805 --> 00:18.603
You'd better get out before
you wrinkle up permanently.

00:21.477 --> 00:23.001
T.C.
Hey, T.M.

00:23.079 --> 00:24.068
Where's Dorsey?

00:24.147 --> 00:25.205
Try the training room.

00:25.281 --> 00:26.771
I may need your help.

02:05.649 --> 02:07.480
Uh, excuse me, guys.

02:08.018 --> 02:10.816
Excuse me. Fellas, fellas,
I got something to say.

02:11.288 --> 02:12.380
Hey!

02:16.527 --> 02:17.858
Thank you.

02:17.928 --> 02:19.452
I just, uh, wanna say

02:19.530 --> 02:21.430
how proud I am
to be able to host,

02:21.498 --> 02:24.092
this here welcoming party
for the Blazers,

02:24.168 --> 02:27.228
before you guys go into the
rigors of training camp tomorrow.

02:27.304 --> 02:29.067
And I would
especially like to thank

02:29.139 --> 02:31.334
the beautiful wife
of your owner,

02:31.408 --> 02:33.433
Mrs. Eleanor Greeley,

02:35.312 --> 02:38.713
For, uh, for allowing me
to open my humble house

02:38.916 --> 02:41.544
to the best damn
football team in the worid.

02:45.088 --> 02:47.955
We're very sorry Mr. Greeley
couldn't make it today

02:48.025 --> 02:49.515
but to show
my appreciation,

02:49.593 --> 02:51.493
when you get to
the locker room tomorrow,

02:51.562 --> 02:53.587
you're each gonna
find a pair

02:53.664 --> 02:56.497
out of a case
of brand-new sandals!

02:59.503 --> 03:01.528
Jack Metro sandals,

03:01.605 --> 03:05.097
in your locker room tomorrow.

03:05.209 --> 03:06.801
You're a swell guy,
Jack.

03:06.877 --> 03:08.344
Oh, gee, thanks, Dumbo.

03:08.412 --> 03:10.243
Don't call me Dumbo.

03:18.355 --> 03:20.220
Mmm, April Ann,

03:21.158 --> 03:23.058
you got about
the prettiest blue-green eyes

03:23.126 --> 03:24.525
I've ever seen
in my life.

03:24.595 --> 03:27.462
They're like deep pools
of diamonds or something.

03:28.632 --> 03:30.497
Dorsey, that's the worst line
I ever heard

03:30.567 --> 03:32.501
from a pro quarterback.

03:33.103 --> 03:35.230
Yeah? Get a lot of those,
do you?

03:35.305 --> 03:38.399
Married to the Sandal King,
more than my share.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.736
I usually get
"eyes like deep pools"

03:40.811 --> 03:42.335
from your defensive linemen.

03:42.412 --> 03:43.470
Oh.

03:43.547 --> 03:45.515
Your wide receivers
tend to hit me with

03:45.582 --> 03:47.641
"legs that go on forever."

03:48.385 --> 03:51.843
Specialty teams tell me
how well I fill out a sweater.

03:51.922 --> 03:53.048
Yeah?

03:53.824 --> 03:55.849
What do quarterbacks say?

03:55.993 --> 03:58.223
They don't need lines,
Dorsey.

04:10.140 --> 04:11.835
Delbert,
you've been very patient

04:11.908 --> 04:13.466
for a number two
quarterback.

04:13.543 --> 04:14.874
You work hard in camp

04:14.945 --> 04:17.277
and this could be
your year, son.

04:18.081 --> 04:21.175
Frankly, I'm worried
about Dorsey.

04:22.719 --> 04:24.516
And not just his arm.

04:24.588 --> 04:25.646
I am, too, sir.

04:25.722 --> 04:28.316
I've tried to talk to him
about his lifestyle.

04:28.392 --> 04:29.484
Now, Patsy and I,

04:29.559 --> 04:31.754
we've tried to
show him the way, but...

04:31.828 --> 04:33.591
The Lord helps those
who help themselves.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.996
We'll keep praying
for him, Coach Bell.

04:36.366 --> 04:37.697
I'm sure you will.

04:47.411 --> 04:49.402
I'm gonna go around
and get the car.

04:49.479 --> 04:50.844
Meet me out front.

04:50.914 --> 04:51.938
Okay.

04:52.015 --> 04:53.004
Mmm.

05:38.161 --> 05:40.561
Damn, somebody
took a shot at me.

05:46.837 --> 05:48.065
Set!

05:50.107 --> 05:51.165
Hut!

05:54.878 --> 05:57.176
Thataway, Billy.
Good hands! Good hands!

05:58.548 --> 05:59.981
Thanks, pal.

06:00.050 --> 06:01.074
Yeah!

06:01.151 --> 06:03.119
All right, All right.
Here we go.

06:03.186 --> 06:04.983
Back to the huddle.
Keep going.

06:05.055 --> 06:07.250
Come on, come on.
Let's play some more of that stuff.

06:07.324 --> 06:08.814
Huddle up!

06:08.892 --> 06:10.951
Let's go. Huddle up.
Huddle up.

06:11.027 --> 06:12.688
Look for a pass.
Ready, break.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.754
<i>Even in the Hawaiian sunshine,</i>

06:14.831 --> 06:17.823
<i>football, to me, smelled like</i>
<i>fall in New England.</i>

06:17.901 --> 06:20.699
<i>Someplace there should be</i>
<i>a prep band playing,</i>

06:20.771 --> 06:22.932
<i>and pretty giris</i>
<i>in short skirts.</i>

06:23.006 --> 06:24.371
<i>And I was 21 again,</i>

06:24.441 --> 06:27.672
<i>with an arm that could</i>
<i>throw passes all afternoon.</i>

06:31.248 --> 06:34.240
Boy, for a bum shoulder
he can sure bring it.

06:36.553 --> 06:37.986
Break!

06:53.703 --> 06:55.102
Oh, look at that.

06:55.172 --> 06:57.436
Look at that.
Oh, the memories.

06:59.109 --> 07:00.235
You know, Thomas,

07:00.310 --> 07:02.778
I can't believe that
he used to be your back up.

07:02.846 --> 07:05.747
Well, Dorsey was three years
behind me at the academy.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.374
He had to learn
from somebody.

07:07.451 --> 07:08.440
Uh-huh.

07:08.518 --> 07:10.679
How come you ain't
the Blazer quarterback?

07:10.754 --> 07:12.949
Well, I thought I wanted
a career in the Navy.

07:13.023 --> 07:14.752
Uh-huh.
You know, Thomas,

07:14.825 --> 07:16.588
that could've been you
out there.

07:16.893 --> 07:18.417
Come on, Rick.

07:20.096 --> 07:21.120
Hut!

07:21.198 --> 07:23.860
Pass! Pass!
Pass, pass, pass!

07:26.903 --> 07:28.461
Didn't give him time.

07:28.538 --> 07:29.800
Say what?

07:29.873 --> 07:32.205
He should've double-pumped
the wide receiver,

07:32.275 --> 07:34.937
then the tight end would've
had time to get in position.

07:35.011 --> 07:36.239
I see.

07:41.785 --> 07:43.252
Bring them in.

07:44.588 --> 07:46.886
Come on, everybody in.
Let's go.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.885
Well, I'll see you guys
after lunch.

07:53.063 --> 07:55.588
Dorsey said he wants to
talk to me about something.

07:55.665 --> 07:56.962
Sure, boy.

07:57.033 --> 08:00.059
Wouldn't wanna interfere
with a quarterback reunion.

08:00.136 --> 08:01.763
They might want
your advice

08:01.838 --> 08:04.966
on, uh, double-pumping
to those wide receivers.

08:28.732 --> 08:30.097
Excuse me.

08:30.467 --> 08:31.832
Excuse me.

08:34.471 --> 08:36.803
I'm looking for
Dorsey Bramlett.

08:37.674 --> 08:39.698
When an athlete
is in training,

08:39.775 --> 08:42.210
don't ever break
his concentration.

08:44.246 --> 08:45.509
<i>Mahalo.</i>

08:53.490 --> 08:54.548
Easy there.

08:54.624 --> 08:55.921
Hey, Dorsey.

08:55.992 --> 08:58.426
Ooh! Hey, Hoss!
How are you?

08:58.495 --> 08:59.519
How you doing?

08:59.596 --> 09:01.393
Hey, you looked great
out there today.

09:02.566 --> 09:05.399
You're a liar, boy.
But I appreciate it.

09:05.969 --> 09:08.199
Oh, I hate training camp.

09:08.638 --> 09:10.003
I hate it.

09:10.273 --> 09:12.298
I don't know.
A place like this, though,

09:12.375 --> 09:14.366
might get to liking it, maybe.

09:14.444 --> 09:15.433
Maybe.

09:15.512 --> 09:18.413
Hey, whose idea was it
to train in Hawaii, anyway?

09:18.481 --> 09:21.041
Uh, Mrs. Greeley.
Club owner's wife.

09:21.585 --> 09:24.986
She runs the ball club while
he's off buying big corporations.

09:25.055 --> 09:26.113
This is her reward

09:26.189 --> 09:28.157
for us winning the
conference title last year.

09:28.224 --> 09:29.248
Nice lady.

09:29.326 --> 09:30.315
Oh, yeah.

09:30.393 --> 09:31.985
I've heard her
called a lot of things.

09:32.062 --> 09:34.257
I've said most of them,
but "nice" wasn't one of them.

09:34.331 --> 09:35.355
Come on, Dorsey.

09:35.432 --> 09:37.832
She carried you for two years
after your surgery.

09:37.901 --> 09:39.835
She had to.
I've got a contract.

09:39.903 --> 09:41.768
Besides, there ain't
too many ball players

09:41.838 --> 09:44.500
can throw a football like
I can, even at 75 percent.

09:46.009 --> 09:48.978
Uh, you still look like you
can sling some hash there, boy.

09:49.412 --> 09:50.504
Yeah?

09:51.348 --> 09:54.340
I don't know. Maybe.
I try and keep in shape.

09:55.552 --> 09:57.850
Man, you had the sweetest arm
I ever saw.

09:57.921 --> 09:58.945
I mean that.

09:59.022 --> 10:00.148
Come on, Dorsey.

10:00.223 --> 10:02.453
You gotta have
your cortisone.

10:02.859 --> 10:04.383
What's it for?

10:04.694 --> 10:06.821
My career, Hoss.
My career.

10:12.302 --> 10:13.496
You, too, Delbert.

10:13.570 --> 10:15.367
No, no,
I'd rather not, sir.

10:15.438 --> 10:16.564
It's routine,
Delbert.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.437
Do we have to go through this
every time?

10:18.508 --> 10:22.638
God doesn't want your shoulder to hurt,
and neither does Coach Bell.

10:22.712 --> 10:24.509
Don't go away.
I'll be right back.

10:24.581 --> 10:26.139
I got everything
you need right here.

10:26.216 --> 10:27.274
Thanks, Dorsey.

10:27.350 --> 10:28.874
I'll just get some
from the office.

10:28.952 --> 10:31.887
No, really. I got
a whole pharmacy down here.

10:32.389 --> 10:35.756
Whatever you need
to build a pro quarterback.

10:35.825 --> 10:37.292
I got it.

10:37.794 --> 10:39.193
Here you go.

10:39.462 --> 10:41.589
Come on,
let's take a hike.

10:44.567 --> 10:45.966
I'll show you my office.

11:00.550 --> 11:02.245
You know, Dorsey,

11:03.253 --> 11:05.448
just holding
the ball again,

11:06.256 --> 11:09.316
just walking out
on the football field again...

11:09.559 --> 11:11.151
It's really...

11:11.861 --> 11:12.919
It's really nice.

11:12.996 --> 11:15.123
Brings back
a lot of memories.

11:15.198 --> 11:17.166
Yeah, I know
all about those memories.

11:17.233 --> 11:18.757
I saw most of them
from the bench.

11:19.936 --> 11:22.166
You were some kind of
quarterback.

11:22.238 --> 11:23.671
Man, you could scramble.

11:23.740 --> 11:25.503
I copied my entire style
from you.

11:25.575 --> 11:27.270
Did you know that?

11:27.877 --> 11:30.539
Maybe in more ways
than just football.

11:31.114 --> 11:32.741
See, Dorsey,
I got this friend.

11:32.816 --> 11:34.511
Actually, he's not a friend.

11:34.584 --> 11:36.142
He runs the estate
where I live.

11:36.219 --> 11:37.516
You could call him a friend.

11:37.587 --> 11:40.021
Anyway,
you sound a lot like I do

11:40.724 --> 11:42.954
when I want
something from him.

11:43.226 --> 11:45.353
So what do you want,
Dorsey?

11:45.995 --> 11:47.121
Protection.

11:51.468 --> 11:53.095
Somebody's trying
to kill me.

11:53.169 --> 11:54.329
What?

11:54.671 --> 11:57.231
Took a shot at me
at a party yesterday.

11:57.307 --> 11:58.968
Good thing I was drunk.

11:59.042 --> 12:01.875
Probably hurt myself diving
in the back seat of the car.

12:01.945 --> 12:03.537
Any idea who?

12:03.613 --> 12:05.774
No, I don't know.
Coach Bell doesn't like me

12:05.849 --> 12:07.316
hanging around
with his daughter.

12:07.383 --> 12:08.907
Neither does Mrs. Greeley.

12:08.985 --> 12:11.681
Especially now that Henry's
out of town so much.

12:11.755 --> 12:15.122
Then there's Delbert Knowlton,
our, uh, back-up quarterback.

12:15.191 --> 12:17.591
He's always praying
for my untimely demise.

12:17.660 --> 12:19.685
My ex-agent, Morrie...

12:20.897 --> 12:23.092
Boy, you never learn,
do you?

12:24.300 --> 12:26.768
Well, they never
shot at me before.

12:28.738 --> 12:32.139
I'm scared, man.
First time in my life.

12:33.576 --> 12:36.511
So, listen, can you
help me out there, buddy?

12:37.480 --> 12:38.606
How?

12:38.982 --> 12:41.143
Practically all your time's
team-connected.

12:41.217 --> 12:44.778
You're either here on the
practice field or at the hotel.

12:44.854 --> 12:47.789
I'd stick out like that
red jersey you practice in.

12:47.857 --> 12:49.882
Not if you join the team.

12:50.660 --> 12:51.820
What?

12:51.895 --> 12:54.363
Yeah, I thought you could be
the, uh, walk-on,

12:54.430 --> 12:56.125
free agent quarterback,
you know.

12:56.199 --> 12:58.326
You could be my roomie.
It's perfect cover.

12:58.401 --> 13:01.234
Dorsey, I cannot quarterback
a pro football team.

13:01.304 --> 13:03.431
Oh, sure you can, man.
You're in great shape.

13:03.506 --> 13:06.771
I wasn't kidding about all that
stuff about copying your style.

13:06.843 --> 13:09.676
I know you can do it.
I gotta get dressed.

13:11.514 --> 13:13.345
This is really crazy.

13:14.918 --> 13:17.148
Dorsey,
this is really crazy.

13:27.730 --> 13:29.630
So that's the way that goes.

13:29.699 --> 13:32.497
Anyway, I don't know what I'm
gonna do because I just...

13:32.569 --> 13:33.763
Hey, Dorsey!

13:33.837 --> 13:35.236
Excuse me,
Dorsey.

13:35.305 --> 13:37.170
I'm really your biggest fan.
Would you...

13:37.240 --> 13:39.003
You betcha.
Here we go.

13:39.075 --> 13:40.372
Come on,
step right up here.

13:40.443 --> 13:41.808
Could you
sign my yearbook?

13:43.279 --> 13:44.940
All right!

13:45.081 --> 13:46.742
Hey,
how about you?

13:49.052 --> 13:50.144
Hey.

13:50.954 --> 13:51.978
Me?

13:52.055 --> 13:53.044
Yeah.

13:53.122 --> 13:54.248
I'm not on the team.

13:54.324 --> 13:56.087
What he means is
he just joined the team.

13:56.159 --> 13:59.128
Come on over here and sign this ball.
Get over here.

14:06.469 --> 14:08.061
Even the fans
believe it.

14:08.137 --> 14:09.195
There you go.

14:09.272 --> 14:10.261
Gee, thanks.

14:10.340 --> 14:11.398
Okay.
That's it, guys.

14:11.474 --> 14:13.101
Come on,
let's go grab a beer.

14:13.810 --> 14:16.040
I never drank beer
in training.

14:39.267 --> 14:41.599
Even for you, I find
this evening's attire

14:41.670 --> 14:43.103
most bizarre.

14:43.171 --> 14:44.934
A rough divorce case
pending?

14:45.006 --> 14:45.995
Higgins!

14:46.074 --> 14:48.008
Or is this some exotic fantasy
you engage in

14:48.076 --> 14:49.509
after the sun goes down?

14:49.578 --> 14:51.944
Win one for the Dipper,
or something or other?

14:52.013 --> 14:53.002
Gipper.

14:53.081 --> 14:54.139
What?

14:54.216 --> 14:56.548
It is Gipper, not Dipper.

14:56.618 --> 14:57.744
What are you doing

14:57.819 --> 15:00.117
entering my guesthouse
without knocking?

15:00.188 --> 15:02.622
I'm here to retrieve
Robin Masters' camera,

15:02.691 --> 15:05.421
which you neglected
to tell me you took.

15:05.794 --> 15:08.854
Additionally, this is not
your guesthouse, it's Robin's.

15:08.930 --> 15:11.558
And let me emphasize
the word "guest."

15:14.136 --> 15:15.797
Animal repellent?

15:16.271 --> 15:19.331
What on earth are you doing
with animal repellent?

15:19.407 --> 15:22.604
"Recommended by the United
States Postal Service."

15:25.914 --> 15:27.279
The lads.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.350
How dare you!

15:29.417 --> 15:32.614
Oh, come on, Higgins.
I was on this case,

15:32.687 --> 15:34.814
and I had to take care
of these watchdogs.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.585
Anyway, it was
a good six months ago.

15:36.658 --> 15:38.558
I just simply forgot
to throw it out.

15:38.627 --> 15:40.754
No wonder they dislike you
so intensely.

15:40.829 --> 15:42.820
How beastly. How savage.

15:43.431 --> 15:44.989
I'm appalled
by your wanton

15:45.066 --> 15:46.727
and blatant cruelty
to animals.

15:46.801 --> 15:48.996
Simply appalled.
This is a grave matter.

15:49.070 --> 15:51.732
One that will affect
our relationship adversely.

15:51.806 --> 15:53.273
What doesn't?

15:53.475 --> 15:55.739
Magnum, you can hardly
compare this atrocity

15:55.810 --> 15:57.937
to your other indiscretions.

15:58.013 --> 15:59.207
All right, Higgins.

15:59.281 --> 16:00.578
I'm not gonna argue with you.

16:00.649 --> 16:02.617
I've taken
all the abuse I'm going to

16:02.684 --> 16:04.652
from both you and your lads.
Enough.

16:04.719 --> 16:07.552
You're not gonna have Thomas
Magnum to kick around anymore.

16:07.622 --> 16:08.714
What?

16:09.324 --> 16:11.383
It's too late
to apologize.

16:11.459 --> 16:12.892
Apologize?

16:12.961 --> 16:14.087
I'm leaving.

16:14.162 --> 16:17.325
I'm going to find a place where
I can live in peace and quiet.

16:17.399 --> 16:19.230
A place where
I can be left alone.

16:19.301 --> 16:21.633
A place where
nobody bothers me.

16:21.903 --> 16:25.134
And a place where nobody
comes in without knocking.

16:25.207 --> 16:28.233
A place without dogs.

16:36.585 --> 16:38.951
<i>My ego and Dorsey</i>
<i>were both telling me</i>

16:39.020 --> 16:41.386
<i>I still had the stuff</i>
<i>to make a pro team.</i>

16:41.456 --> 16:43.549
<i>But my birth certificate</i>
<i>and my little voice</i>

16:43.625 --> 16:45.559
<i>were telling me otherwise.</i>

16:51.933 --> 16:53.491
Yeah,
so I talked to Eleanor.

16:53.568 --> 16:56.332
She says if you're good enough
for me you're good enough for her.

16:56.404 --> 16:59.271
She's coming by here a little bit later.
Wants to meet you.

17:07.348 --> 17:10.182
That guy Sromosky sure has
a funny way of warming up.

17:10.252 --> 17:12.811
Must work.
Six years all-pro lineman.

17:12.887 --> 17:15.377
Broken more bones than
anybody else in the league.

17:15.457 --> 17:17.721
Looks like
he's a quick healer.

17:18.126 --> 17:20.753
Not his bones.
Other people's bones.

17:21.128 --> 17:22.117
Ah.

17:23.164 --> 17:24.529
Who is he?

17:24.799 --> 17:27.267
Thomas Magnum.
Free agent walk-on.

17:27.602 --> 17:29.433
Funny guy.

17:29.504 --> 17:32.701
Told us this joke about
this Polish weightlifter,

17:33.074 --> 17:35.372
which I personally
found reprehensible.

17:35.443 --> 17:38.037
Anyway, Clyde,
take care of that hand.

17:40.482 --> 17:41.972
Come on, Hoss,
get your armor on.

17:42.050 --> 17:43.540
I wanna introduce you
to Coach Bell.

17:43.618 --> 17:44.983
He's real anxious
to meet you.

17:45.053 --> 17:46.350
Hey, Delbert,

17:46.421 --> 17:48.821
I want you to meet your new
competition at spear carrier.

17:48.890 --> 17:50.187
Tom Magnum.
Delbert Knowlton.

17:50.258 --> 17:51.316
Hello, Tom.

17:51.393 --> 17:52.451
Delbert.

17:52.527 --> 17:55.052
How's your shoulder?
Mine seems to be a little worse.

17:55.130 --> 17:56.358
I'm doing fine.

17:56.431 --> 17:58.058
Patsy and I have
been praying for you.

17:58.133 --> 17:59.862
I'll bet you have, Delbert.

17:59.934 --> 18:02.198
I don't think
it'll get you off the pines.

18:03.938 --> 18:05.303
Delbert.

18:05.373 --> 18:06.465
Yeah.

18:08.677 --> 18:10.975
One, two, three, hut!

18:11.046 --> 18:13.105
One, two, three...

18:13.248 --> 18:15.876
No wonder people wanna
kill you, Dorsey.

18:16.151 --> 18:17.743
You're not nice.

18:17.886 --> 18:20.047
What, that?
That was a joke.

18:22.691 --> 18:25.251
T.C.,
what're you doing here?

18:25.327 --> 18:26.954
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

18:27.028 --> 18:29.053
I'm trying out for the team,
like everybody else.

18:29.130 --> 18:30.290
Dorsey here set it up.

18:30.365 --> 18:32.333
Yeah, yeah,
I couldn't help myself.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.335
Man's an all-American tight
end from Grambling University,

18:35.403 --> 18:37.735
goes over to Vietnam
to serve his country.

18:37.806 --> 18:40.400
Flying a whirlybird.
That's a waste.

18:40.475 --> 18:41.567
You're Magnum.

18:41.643 --> 18:42.701
Yes, sir.

18:42.777 --> 18:44.745
I remember. Navy.

18:45.447 --> 18:46.744
You were pretty good.

18:46.815 --> 18:48.476
But that was
a long time ago.

18:48.550 --> 18:49.915
No,
he's still good.

18:49.984 --> 18:53.579
Besides, Mrs. Eleanor Greeley
wants to give him a chance.

18:53.955 --> 18:55.047
Okay.

18:55.123 --> 18:56.920
Dorsey, get in there
and warm up the team

18:56.991 --> 18:58.652
for Mr. Magnum's debut.

18:58.727 --> 19:00.558
T.C., you've seen
the playbook.

19:00.628 --> 19:02.357
Go on in for Darnell.

19:07.402 --> 19:09.734
Hey, T.C., I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

19:09.804 --> 19:10.828
What?

19:10.905 --> 19:12.634
You coming out here
to help me and all.

19:13.808 --> 19:16.072
Man, I am trying to
make this team.

19:16.144 --> 19:19.602
Kinda got the itch after I saw
them practice the other day.

19:19.681 --> 19:22.149
Decided I'd give it
one more shot.

19:22.217 --> 19:23.377
Yeah.

19:24.686 --> 19:25.880
Right.

19:26.354 --> 19:29.323
Whatever you're here for,
you're on your own.

19:37.499 --> 19:38.488
Set.

19:40.902 --> 19:42.028
Hut!

19:45.173 --> 19:48.108
All right, all right,
way to go! Good job, good job.

19:48.176 --> 19:50.701
Huddle up. Let's go.
We'll get them.

19:57.118 --> 19:58.551
Hut!

20:03.992 --> 20:05.289
You know,

20:05.860 --> 20:08.021
that guy Dorsey's
really something.

20:08.096 --> 20:10.564
Always putting on a show,
even in practice.

20:10.632 --> 20:12.725
You know,
sometimes I think

20:12.801 --> 20:15.463
that's half the job
of being a pro athlete.

20:15.537 --> 20:18.438
You know, being able to,
to dazzle the crowd

20:18.506 --> 20:20.633
with more
than just talent.

20:20.708 --> 20:22.198
I admire that.

20:22.544 --> 20:25.672
But I imagine there's
some players who resent it.

20:25.747 --> 20:27.476
Don't you think so?

20:33.354 --> 20:36.687
I just kick.
I am the kicker.

20:36.925 --> 20:39.155
Huddle up. Huddle up.

20:46.868 --> 20:48.768
Break! Break!

20:54.142 --> 20:55.507
Set!

21:05.220 --> 21:06.312
Dorsey's hurting.

21:06.387 --> 21:08.218
Let's get him out
of here, Clarence.

21:08.756 --> 21:10.018
Dorsey!

21:10.158 --> 21:12.991
Huddle up! Huddle up.
Huddle up. Huddle up.

21:14.329 --> 21:16.763
All right, Magnum.
You're up.

21:20.735 --> 21:22.999
Uh, Coach,
how can I call a play?

21:23.071 --> 21:24.800
I don't even have
a playbook yet.

21:24.873 --> 21:25.897
I'll call them.

21:25.974 --> 21:27.965
The first one is
"Y" five split six.

21:28.042 --> 21:30.533
Now, all you have to do
is hit the flanker

21:30.612 --> 21:32.910
10 yards downfield
in the right flat.

21:32.981 --> 21:33.948
You got it?

21:34.015 --> 21:35.073
Uh, yeah.

21:35.149 --> 21:36.912
Good. Let's see it.

21:37.952 --> 21:39.647
Go get them, Hoss.

21:42.090 --> 21:43.318
Break!

21:49.464 --> 21:51.091
Four-85!

21:51.299 --> 21:52.789
Four-85!

21:53.601 --> 21:54.932
Set. Hut!

22:00.008 --> 22:02.169
Thataway, T.C.!
Good grab. Good grab.

22:02.243 --> 22:04.803
Huddle up. Huddle up.
Huddle up. Let's go.

22:05.647 --> 22:07.342
Nice catch, 88.

22:08.316 --> 22:11.308
You look almost as surprised
as the receiver.

22:12.554 --> 22:15.182
All right, come on, huddle up.

22:30.872 --> 22:32.635
Split right, six Y.
Ready?

22:32.707 --> 22:34.106
Break!

22:41.783 --> 22:42.909
Set!

22:46.120 --> 22:48.645
Sorry, man.
I guess I'm a little up.

22:49.023 --> 22:50.217
Yeah.

22:51.893 --> 22:53.656
Man, you okay?

22:53.728 --> 22:54.820
No.

22:57.432 --> 22:59.400
Did I do
something wrong?

22:59.467 --> 23:01.799
No, man,
he just jumped offside.

23:11.179 --> 23:12.612
Same play, on hut.
Ready?

23:12.680 --> 23:13.874
Break!

23:22.190 --> 23:23.316
Set.

23:26.961 --> 23:28.019
Hut!

23:28.863 --> 23:30.296
Blitz! Blitz!

23:34.769 --> 23:37.260
Way to go, team. Way to go.

23:39.974 --> 23:41.134
Oops.

23:48.750 --> 23:49.978
Oh, my.

24:03.598 --> 24:05.589
I don't know who's crazier.

24:05.667 --> 24:08.534
You for asking me to do this
or me for doing it.

24:08.603 --> 24:11.401
Hey. You did just fine.
You're a little rusty is all.

24:11.472 --> 24:13.235
Wish I had that excuse.

24:13.307 --> 24:14.968
I look terrible!

24:15.910 --> 24:17.537
I feel terrible.

24:17.979 --> 24:19.446
How's your shoulder?

24:19.514 --> 24:21.004
It's great.

24:21.582 --> 24:23.982
As long as I'm using
these babies.

24:24.419 --> 24:26.182
What are those for?

24:28.089 --> 24:29.613
So I don't get pregnant.

24:31.125 --> 24:34.026
Same old Dorsey.
Same old lines.

24:34.729 --> 24:36.356
You must be Tom.

24:38.099 --> 24:39.498
Yes, ma'am.

24:40.134 --> 24:42.068
Don't be so polite,
Tom.

24:42.136 --> 24:43.899
I believe in
close relationships

24:43.971 --> 24:46.132
between players
and management.

24:46.207 --> 24:47.834
Call me Eleanor.

24:48.076 --> 24:49.737
Nice to meet you.

24:51.045 --> 24:52.876
I heard you had
a rough go of it.

24:52.947 --> 24:53.971
Yeah.

24:54.048 --> 24:55.276
You, too.

24:55.349 --> 24:56.748
Oh, I'll be just fine.

24:56.818 --> 24:58.581
Oh, I know you will,
Dorsey.

24:58.653 --> 25:00.484
You're my number one
quarterback.

25:00.555 --> 25:01.852
As a matter of fact,

25:01.923 --> 25:04.118
Coach Bell and I
were discussing you today.

25:04.192 --> 25:06.558
He's a little worried
about you.

25:06.828 --> 25:08.625
Yeah.
What did he have to say?

25:08.696 --> 25:10.527
Oh, he was thinking of

25:10.598 --> 25:12.998
starting Delbert
this season.

25:14.702 --> 25:16.499
You gotta be kidding.

25:17.405 --> 25:19.270
Well, he's not.

25:21.642 --> 25:24.042
But then,
the final decision is mine,

25:24.112 --> 25:26.137
since Henry's out of town.

25:27.215 --> 25:28.409
Dinner?

25:32.420 --> 25:34.047
8:00, my place.

25:38.760 --> 25:42.218
You'd better get out before
you wrinkle up permanently.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.626
Nice to meet you.

25:59.347 --> 26:01.611
I love this game.
I really do.

26:12.827 --> 26:15.261
Isn't it glorious, lads?

26:17.398 --> 26:20.299
I find the silence
and serenity sublime.

26:23.137 --> 26:25.367
No screeching of tires
past my window

26:25.439 --> 26:27.566
in the early morning hours.

26:28.543 --> 26:32.035
No strange sounds emanating
from the guesthouse.

26:33.981 --> 26:36.745
No more sordid
and tawdry guests.

26:39.787 --> 26:42.255
No more abuse
of private property.

26:47.261 --> 26:48.819
No more Magnum.

26:53.167 --> 26:55.727
Well, lads,
what shall we do tonight?

26:57.205 --> 26:58.729
A good choice.

26:59.207 --> 27:00.799
After we share
a hearty supper

27:00.875 --> 27:02.433
we'll settle down
by the fire

27:02.510 --> 27:06.105
and give a listen to some of
Verdi's lesser-known operas.

27:06.848 --> 27:09.009
Perhaps a snifter
of brandy

27:09.684 --> 27:11.083
and a pipe.

27:32.473 --> 27:34.907
Hey, Thomas, wake up.
This is bed check.

27:35.376 --> 27:36.638
I'm in bed.

27:36.711 --> 27:38.975
Yeah,
but your roommate ain't.

28:07.274 --> 28:09.572
<i>I was pretty sure</i>
<i>nobody was doing bed checks</i>

28:09.643 --> 28:11.270
<i>in Mrs. Greeley's house.</i>

28:11.344 --> 28:13.209
<i>That is, no one but me.</i>

28:13.280 --> 28:15.248
<i>Protecting Dorsey</i>
<i>had now entered that phase</i>

28:15.315 --> 28:17.078
<i>I particularly dislike.</i>

28:17.150 --> 28:18.640
<i>Baby-sitting.</i>

28:20.287 --> 28:22.278
The door's open.

28:29.462 --> 28:32.158
Dorsey, it's about time
you showed...

28:33.600 --> 28:34.726
Tom.

28:38.071 --> 28:39.470
You rascal.

28:40.607 --> 28:41.699
Hi.

28:43.877 --> 28:47.142
Tom, you must really wanna
make the team bad.

28:48.248 --> 28:51.411
I'd offer you something,
but you're in training.

28:51.751 --> 28:54.117
Well, maybe
I'll let you slide.

28:54.554 --> 28:55.953
No, thanks.

28:56.556 --> 28:58.717
Oh. So you're not
thirsty.

29:00.327 --> 29:01.851
Wanna come in?

29:05.999 --> 29:07.899
Look, I'm trying
to find Dorsey.

29:07.968 --> 29:09.902
Why would you
look here?

29:10.170 --> 29:12.604
Well, he was having
dinner with you.

29:12.672 --> 29:16.039
And you assumed that meant
he was spending the night.

29:17.477 --> 29:18.705
Tom.

29:18.778 --> 29:20.541
What are you up to?

29:21.248 --> 29:22.408
Up to?

29:22.816 --> 29:26.252
Listen, mister,
I have a brother in Jersey,

29:26.319 --> 29:29.152
sitting on roller-skate wheels
selling pencils,

29:29.222 --> 29:32.055
who has a better chance of
getting on the team than you do.

29:32.125 --> 29:33.820
Are you going to tell me
who you are,

29:33.894 --> 29:35.589
or do I have to
make a phone call

29:35.662 --> 29:38.460
requesting the presence
of Clyde Sromosky?

29:38.531 --> 29:40.624
I'm a private investigator.

29:41.601 --> 29:43.626
Dorsey hired me
to protect him.

29:43.737 --> 29:44.863
Oh.

29:44.938 --> 29:46.735
That little incident
at the party

29:46.806 --> 29:49.366
must've put
the fear of God into him.

29:49.442 --> 29:51.103
Good old Dorsey.

29:51.177 --> 29:54.806
Just beginning to understand
that not everybody loves him.

29:55.782 --> 29:58.182
He knows I put
extra security on.

29:58.251 --> 30:00.082
Doesn't he trust me?

30:00.553 --> 30:03.488
Well, he's not sure
who his friends are.

30:03.957 --> 30:05.322
Well!

30:05.392 --> 30:08.088
Whose fault is that,
the way he lives?

30:11.798 --> 30:13.857
Did he show up
for dinner?

30:15.368 --> 30:16.494
No.

30:16.970 --> 30:18.562
No, he did not.

30:18.872 --> 30:20.430
Well, he's not in bed.

30:20.507 --> 30:22.202
Wanna make a bet?

30:26.346 --> 30:28.940
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

30:29.015 --> 30:33.042
You might check the Sandal
King Jack Metro's wife.

30:33.520 --> 30:36.614
She had her hooks into him
yesterday at a party.

30:37.190 --> 30:38.623
Look, uh,
Mrs. Greeley,

30:38.692 --> 30:40.159
if... if my coming here
offended you...

30:40.226 --> 30:42.091
Save it. Save it.

30:43.196 --> 30:45.756
I'm not doing you a favor,
or Dorsey.

30:46.633 --> 30:50.228
He's a big investment.
A very big one.

30:50.837 --> 30:52.202
That's all.

30:52.672 --> 30:55.402
Despite anything else
I might have said.

30:57.978 --> 30:59.343
Thank you.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.794
<i>If there's one thing</i>
<i>I hate more than babysitting,</i>

31:22.869 --> 31:25.064
<i>it's fetching a client</i>
<i>from another man's wife.</i>

31:25.138 --> 31:28.301
<i>You see, there's no way to be</i>
<i>sure the husband won't show up,</i>

31:28.375 --> 31:32.038
<i>and that can make for the worst</i>
<i>kind of domestic argument.</i>

31:33.847 --> 31:36.042
Hey, guy,
you're just the man I wanted to see.

31:36.116 --> 31:38.209
We're gonna catch a plane
to Vegas. Me and April Ann.

31:38.284 --> 31:39.581
You can be my best man.

31:39.652 --> 31:42.143
It's 3:00 a.m. There are
no planes to Vegas now.

31:42.222 --> 31:44.850
Besides, her husband's probably
gonna be home any second.

31:44.924 --> 31:46.949
Oh, no, he's not,
'cause he's out of town.

31:47.027 --> 31:48.221
She's still married.

31:48.294 --> 31:49.420
I'll get a divorce.

31:49.496 --> 31:50.793
Drive us
to the airport.

31:50.864 --> 31:53.059
You've got a practice game
in the morning.

31:53.133 --> 31:55.260
To hell with practice.
To hell with Mrs. Greeley.

31:55.335 --> 31:57.462
To hell with the Blazers.
To hell with football.

31:57.537 --> 31:58.765
Hey, come on,
Dorsey.

31:58.838 --> 31:59.930
The hell with you.

32:00.006 --> 32:00.995
Dorsey!

32:03.043 --> 32:05.102
What's the matter
with you?

32:05.345 --> 32:06.607
Damn it.

32:08.381 --> 32:10.042
I'm your friend.

32:10.150 --> 32:13.381
Maybe you don't know
what that word means anymore.

32:14.087 --> 32:15.884
Yeah, maybe I don't.

32:17.023 --> 32:18.581
Oh, hell, man, I'm sorry.

32:18.658 --> 32:21.218
L... l... I didn't mean
to do that.

32:21.461 --> 32:22.553
Hey.

32:23.163 --> 32:25.688
L... I don't know, l... I guess
I'm still a bit nervous

32:25.765 --> 32:28.734
about somebody trying
to kill me, that's all.

32:28.802 --> 32:29.860
I wonder why?

32:29.936 --> 32:32.029
You know, in the last 24 hours
I've watched you

32:32.105 --> 32:34.972
alienate half a dozen people,
including me.

32:36.076 --> 32:37.600
Hey, I don't mean
to do that.

32:37.677 --> 32:40.441
You know I don't mean half of
what I say, and I never did.

32:40.513 --> 32:41.639
I know.

32:41.714 --> 32:43.511
You got away with it
when you were a kid,

32:43.583 --> 32:45.073
but you're not
a kid anymore.

32:45.151 --> 32:46.641
I don't need you
to tell me this.

32:46.719 --> 32:48.346
Then why do you
keep doing it?

32:48.421 --> 32:50.821
Hey, look. People get used to
seeing you some way,

32:50.890 --> 32:52.357
they see you
as a wise guy.

32:52.425 --> 32:54.222
That's your image,
you're a hell raiser.

32:54.294 --> 32:56.592
That's what
they expect to see.

32:57.097 --> 32:59.463
I mean,
even if you outgrow that.

33:00.133 --> 33:02.499
It's not easy
being the team jerk.

33:02.569 --> 33:03.968
Dorsey,
I'm gonna get sick

33:04.037 --> 33:05.698
if I hear anymore
of this mush.

33:05.772 --> 33:07.330
I'm with you,
April Ann. Come on.

33:07.407 --> 33:08.533
If we can't go to Vegas

33:08.608 --> 33:10.769
let's go and have
one more cocktail, okay?

33:10.844 --> 33:12.573
Just one, huh?

33:25.925 --> 33:27.324
April Ann.

33:27.927 --> 33:30.760
April Ann, come on, now,
don't die, honey.

33:30.997 --> 33:33.397
Oh, come on, April Ann,
now, don't die.

33:33.466 --> 33:34.763
Come on.

33:43.743 --> 33:45.438
Set! Hut!

33:49.349 --> 33:51.909
<i>April Ann's death</i>
<i>didn't affect Delbert,</i>

33:51.985 --> 33:53.145
<i>or the coaches,</i>

33:53.219 --> 33:55.744
<i>or anyone on the team</i>
<i>except Dorsey.</i>

33:55.889 --> 33:58.653
<i>He didn't have time to develop</i>
<i>any deep feelings for her,</i>

33:58.725 --> 34:01.956
<i>and even if he had she'd still</i>
<i>have been one of a hundred to him.</i>

34:02.028 --> 34:04.394
<i>But this one had died</i>
<i>because of him,</i>

34:04.464 --> 34:07.695
<i>and Dorsey was having</i>
<i>a tough time dealing with it,</i>

34:07.767 --> 34:10.132
<i>which gave me</i>
<i>some hope for him.</i>

34:16.208 --> 34:17.471
Hold it.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.306
I've been here every day.

34:19.379 --> 34:21.973
Yeah, well.
Not today. Out.

34:23.650 --> 34:25.618
Sure. I understand.

34:33.025 --> 34:35.391
Rip! Kill! Guts!

34:38.063 --> 34:41.192
I'm gonna crush
everything in my path.

34:41.266 --> 34:43.132
Everything in my path!

34:53.045 --> 34:54.070
Magnum.

34:57.717 --> 34:59.048
Higgins.

35:00.653 --> 35:02.678
I, uh, brought your mail.

35:02.755 --> 35:04.017
Or rather your bills,

35:04.090 --> 35:06.490
and that seems to be all
you receive these days.

35:06.559 --> 35:09.119
Higgins, I have
only been gone 24 hours.

35:09.195 --> 35:11.163
Nevertheless,
you should attend to them.

35:11.231 --> 35:13.563
I don't want the inevitable
parade of process servers

35:13.633 --> 35:16.193
and bill collectors
trooping through the estate.

35:17.704 --> 35:19.638
Isn't this a bit
self-destructive,

35:19.706 --> 35:20.866
even for you?

35:20.940 --> 35:23.135
Higgins, would you please
give me my bills...

35:23.209 --> 35:25.074
My mail? Thank you.

35:29.549 --> 35:31.312
Working on a case?

35:31.384 --> 35:32.681
Mmm-hmm.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.417
One of the players?

35:36.489 --> 35:37.751
Uh-huh.

35:38.791 --> 35:39.815
Which one?

35:39.892 --> 35:41.154
Higgins!

35:42.962 --> 35:44.224
Higgins.

35:45.531 --> 35:48.261
What do you know
about sports injuries?

35:48.735 --> 35:51.203
Well, of course,
I'm not a physician.

35:51.271 --> 35:54.104
However, when I was stationed
in Banaras after the war,

35:54.173 --> 35:56.835
I was coach of
the regimental rugby team.

35:56.909 --> 35:58.069
A game far superior

35:58.144 --> 36:00.339
to your American football,
I might add.

36:00.413 --> 36:03.177
Our chaps don't see the
necessity for all the padding.

36:03.249 --> 36:04.876
Higgins, please.

36:07.053 --> 36:09.613
While there,
I worked quite closely

36:09.689 --> 36:11.657
with several
military physicians.

36:11.724 --> 36:14.158
Oh, good.
Now, how about shoulders?

36:14.227 --> 36:16.787
You need cortisone
for bursitis, right?

36:16.863 --> 36:17.955
Yes.

36:18.031 --> 36:20.363
Most likely
subdeltoid bursitis.

36:21.868 --> 36:24.063
Subdeltoid.
Under the deltoid.

36:24.137 --> 36:27.106
Bursitis. Inflammation
of the tendon and bone.

36:27.173 --> 36:28.504
Of course.

36:28.908 --> 36:30.637
It's generally treated
with a mixture

36:30.710 --> 36:32.473
of cortisone
and lidocaine.

36:32.545 --> 36:34.979
The cortisone
brings down the inflammation,

36:35.048 --> 36:38.211
and the lidocaine tempers
the pain of the initial shot.

36:38.284 --> 36:39.774
It's a large-gauge needle,
you know.

36:39.852 --> 36:40.978
Yes, I know.

36:41.054 --> 36:41.952
Generally,

36:42.021 --> 36:44.512
one or two treatments
are all that are necessary.

36:44.824 --> 36:46.121
That's all?

36:46.192 --> 36:47.716
Generally, yes.

36:59.806 --> 37:01.899
All right, Billy. Get it.

37:04.911 --> 37:07.573
All right, huddle up.
Let's go. Huddle up.

37:26.165 --> 37:28.759
Intercept. Intercept.
All right, defense. All right.

37:51.457 --> 37:52.549
Hey!

37:55.328 --> 37:56.852
Hey!

38:14.680 --> 38:15.977
Hey!

38:58.424 --> 39:00.858
Had you seen him
before?

39:01.227 --> 39:02.751
Yeah, he's been
hanging around here.

39:02.829 --> 39:04.456
I guess I've seen him.

39:04.530 --> 39:05.997
Are we done here?

39:06.065 --> 39:07.430
In a minute.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.730
Does this mean
anything to you?

39:13.272 --> 39:15.331
He also had this note.

39:15.408 --> 39:19.208
"Dorsey had been.
I am. Dorsey was.

39:19.946 --> 39:21.607
"Dorsey had been.

39:22.014 --> 39:24.949
I am. I am. I am."

39:27.820 --> 39:28.946
Wow.

39:29.789 --> 39:31.518
I don't understand.

39:32.825 --> 39:34.224
Thank you.

39:41.667 --> 39:43.726
Dorsey, he was
a sick kid.

39:44.537 --> 39:46.562
April Ann died for this?

39:47.240 --> 39:48.571
He thought
he was you.

39:48.641 --> 39:49.972
In his mind
he'd become you.

39:50.042 --> 39:51.703
So every time
you stepped on that field

39:51.777 --> 39:53.642
it was destroying
his version of reality.

39:53.713 --> 39:55.840
So he had to get rid of you.

39:56.315 --> 39:57.509
I guess

39:57.917 --> 40:00.215
April Ann just got caught
in the middle.

40:00.286 --> 40:02.311
Just caught in the middle?

40:10.496 --> 40:12.691
Dorsey,
it wasn't your fault.

40:13.666 --> 40:14.928
Dorsey.

40:18.070 --> 40:19.230
You know, Magnum,

40:19.305 --> 40:21.899
it was quite peaceful here
while you were gone.

40:21.974 --> 40:23.703
Tranquil, actually.

40:24.343 --> 40:26.277
Not a single incident.

40:26.612 --> 40:28.136
Not one alarm.

40:29.081 --> 40:32.278
No interloper to disrupt
my day or night.

40:34.253 --> 40:36.847
I'm sorry they cut you
from the team.

40:38.491 --> 40:40.755
Higgins, are you trying
to tell me you missed me?

40:40.826 --> 40:42.691
Me? Good heavens, no.

40:42.862 --> 40:43.988
But the lads did.

40:44.063 --> 40:45.155
They did?

40:45.231 --> 40:47.222
They had no one to chase.

40:49.035 --> 40:52.300
Higgins, I am not in the mood
for our usual banter.

40:53.172 --> 40:54.366
Really?

40:54.440 --> 40:56.067
I should think
you'd be quite happy.

40:56.142 --> 40:59.373
Your case is finished and you're
no more badly beaten up than usual.

40:59.445 --> 41:01.310
That's just it, Higgins.

41:01.380 --> 41:03.314
The case isn't finished.

41:03.382 --> 41:05.475
There's more going on here

41:05.585 --> 41:08.418
than some sick kid
taking shots at Dorsey.

41:08.654 --> 41:10.713
Your little voice again?

41:11.591 --> 41:13.286
Mine and Five-O's.

41:13.459 --> 41:14.653
See.

41:15.528 --> 41:17.860
The kid used a.22
at the stadium

41:17.930 --> 41:19.795
and April Ann
was killed with a.32.

41:19.865 --> 41:23.301
And so far they haven't found
one yet in his apartment.

41:23.369 --> 41:25.860
So there was more than
one person out to kill Dorsey.

41:25.938 --> 41:27.906
Either that
or he wasn't the target.

41:27.974 --> 41:29.100
Thomas.

41:29.175 --> 41:30.472
In the bedroom, Rick.

41:30.543 --> 41:32.773
Who was the target?
April Ann?

41:33.079 --> 41:34.273
Or me.

41:37.116 --> 41:39.676
Oh, hi, Higgins. Are you, uh,
helping Thomas unpack?

41:39.752 --> 41:40.684
Hardly.

41:40.753 --> 41:42.243
Did you find anything out?

41:42.321 --> 41:44.255
Yeah. It was lidocaine.

41:44.557 --> 41:46.184
You sure?
Uh-huh.

41:46.258 --> 41:47.919
What are you two
talking about?

41:47.994 --> 41:49.689
Well, Thomas gave me
some stuff

41:49.762 --> 41:52.526
that the team doctor's been
shooting into Dorsey's shoulder.

41:52.598 --> 41:53.826
So I had it analyzed.

41:53.899 --> 41:56.060
The doc seemed reluctant
to give the same injection

41:56.135 --> 41:57.625
to Delbert,
the other quarterback,

41:57.703 --> 41:59.398
so I thought maybe
he gave Dorsey

41:59.472 --> 42:01.406
something other than
lidocaine and cortisone.

42:01.474 --> 42:02.907
No, it was lidocaine.

42:02.975 --> 42:04.169
And cortisone.

42:04.243 --> 42:05.733
Thomas,
are you deaf or what?

42:05.811 --> 42:08.712
I just told you twice,
it was just lidocaine.

42:08.781 --> 42:10.612
No, but all
the lidocaine's for

42:10.683 --> 42:13.880
is to lessen the pain
of the cortisone injection.

42:15.021 --> 42:18.115
Well, it would also, uh,
block the pain of the injury as well.

42:18.190 --> 42:19.555
Quite dangerous.

42:19.625 --> 42:21.217
The injured joint
feels fine,

42:21.293 --> 42:24.387
but if you use it,
you literally tear it apart.

42:24.630 --> 42:27.155
I remember a polo pony
we had in Kwangju.

42:27.233 --> 42:29.758
That was in, uh, '48.
Or was it '49?

42:30.503 --> 42:31.902
It was '49, yes.

42:31.971 --> 42:34.667
That was the year Corky
Boswick got kicked in the head.

42:34.740 --> 42:37.971
Anyway, this pony
had an injured fetlock...

42:39.879 --> 42:41.278
You'll enjoy this, Rick.

42:41.347 --> 42:43.577
It was the Sunday
of the Queen's birthday party,

42:43.649 --> 42:45.048
so naturally
we had a match

42:45.117 --> 42:47.176
with the finest polo team
in all of Asia.

42:47.253 --> 42:49.084
Corky Boswick
came charging out

42:49.155 --> 42:51.282
on the field
and lost control of his mare

42:51.357 --> 42:53.325
when a stallion
from the opposing team

42:53.392 --> 42:55.326
gave a passionate whinny.

42:56.462 --> 42:57.952
Extraordinary.

43:00.666 --> 43:03.396
<i>I hated it,</i>
<i>but it all made sense.</i>

43:03.469 --> 43:06.097
<i>Dorsey had been playing</i>
<i>at half speed until today.</i>

43:06.172 --> 43:09.369
<i>Tonight's game would decide who'd</i>
<i>start the season at quarterback,</i>

43:09.442 --> 43:11.137
<i>and Dorsey would be</i>
<i>going all out</i>

43:11.210 --> 43:13.269
<i>on a shoulder</i>
<i>that had mush for tendons.</i>

43:13.345 --> 43:14.903
<i>I had a real strong feeling</i>

43:14.980 --> 43:17.710
<i>Mrs. Greeley planned to collect</i>
<i>some heavy insurance on him.</i>

43:18.150 --> 43:21.745
<i>Good evening football fans,</i>
<i>and welcome to Aloha Stadium</i>

43:21.821 --> 43:24.619
<i>and Honolulu's</i>
<i>Fifth Annual Pro-college Bowl.</i>

43:24.690 --> 43:26.555
<i>Tonight</i>
<i>the New Jersey Blazers</i>

43:26.625 --> 43:28.957
<i>tackle</i>
<i>the All-Stars of the Pac-10.</i>

43:29.028 --> 43:30.928
<i>Proceeds</i>
<i>for tonight's contest</i>

43:30.996 --> 43:34.090
<i>go to the Honolulu</i>
<i>Crippled Children's Society.</i>

43:37.937 --> 43:39.302
Hey, Dorsey.

43:39.371 --> 43:41.305
Tonight's a big night
for both of us.

43:41.373 --> 43:42.840
And I just want you
to know that...

43:42.908 --> 43:45.240
You prayed for me,
huh, Delbert?

43:47.513 --> 43:48.707
Del.

43:48.814 --> 43:49.974
Yeah.

43:51.517 --> 43:52.745
Thanks.

44:06.332 --> 44:07.822
T.C.
Hey, T.M.

44:07.900 --> 44:08.992
Where's Dorsey?

44:09.068 --> 44:11.161
Coach is putting me
on the special team tonight.

44:11.237 --> 44:12.499
That's great.
Where's Dorsey?

44:12.571 --> 44:14.095
I don't know.
Try the training room.

44:14.173 --> 44:15.367
Come on.
Huh?

44:15.441 --> 44:17.136
I may need your help.

44:17.209 --> 44:19.837
Need my help? Oh, wait... wait... wait.
I don't wanna know.

44:19.912 --> 44:22.403
I help you, I don't get
a chance to play. Bye.

44:22.481 --> 44:23.641
T.C.!

44:28.788 --> 44:31.689
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>now coming on the field,</i>

44:31.757 --> 44:34.555
<i>let's hear it for</i>
<i>the New Jersey Blazers.</i>

44:36.896 --> 44:39.490
<i>And here come</i>
<i>the Pac-10 All-Stars.</i>

44:40.266 --> 44:41.995
You gonna give us
your best shot?

44:42.067 --> 44:43.056
I always do.

44:43.135 --> 44:44.659
You ought to know that
by now.

44:44.737 --> 44:45.761
Hey, Hoss.

44:45.838 --> 44:47.169
Come to watch me
win this game?

44:47.239 --> 44:50.208
No. To stop you
from throwing your arm away.

44:50.543 --> 44:52.272
Magnum, you're not
part of the team.

44:52.344 --> 44:53.402
Get out.

44:53.479 --> 44:55.379
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

44:55.447 --> 44:56.607
She and the doc here

44:56.682 --> 44:58.650
have been using injections
without cortisone.

44:58.717 --> 45:00.912
Your arm may feel okay,
but it's not, Dorsey.

45:00.986 --> 45:02.078
That's a lie.

45:02.154 --> 45:03.917
What? Insurance?

45:03.989 --> 45:05.650
Maybe a little getting even?

45:05.724 --> 45:07.021
I want him
out of here.

45:07.092 --> 45:08.923
Hey, pal. Wait...
wait a minute.

45:08.994 --> 45:10.586
Oh, come on, Ski.

45:10.663 --> 45:13.188
Look, I'm just trying
to help Dorsey.

45:13.833 --> 45:15.494
Not so fast, Doc.

45:17.369 --> 45:18.631
I knew it.

45:18.704 --> 45:19.693
Hey, Ski...

45:19.772 --> 45:21.137
Dorsey,
stay out of it.

45:21.207 --> 45:22.868
What're you doing?

45:28.247 --> 45:29.271
I knew it.

45:29.348 --> 45:31.543
My shoulder's out.
I knew it.

45:32.918 --> 45:35.216
Dumbo, get out of the way.

45:36.555 --> 45:38.489
That's a.32, isn't it?

45:38.757 --> 45:40.554
You killed
April Ann.

45:40.626 --> 45:41.684
No, l...

45:41.760 --> 45:43.660
No, you were shooting at me.

45:43.729 --> 45:45.720
Afraid I'd catch on
to what you were doing?

45:45.798 --> 45:47.629
Eleanor,
tell him to let me go.

45:47.700 --> 45:49.964
What're you gonna do,
Eleanor, shoot us all?

45:50.069 --> 45:51.798
Dumbo,
let me go.

45:54.707 --> 45:56.174
My name's Clarence.

45:56.242 --> 45:58.733
Move it, Dumbo.
Damn it!

46:02.648 --> 46:03.910
Hit bad, Clarence?

46:03.983 --> 46:05.007
Are you kidding?

46:05.084 --> 46:07.109
After 15 years
in the pros?

46:08.721 --> 46:10.279
Dorsey!

46:10.689 --> 46:12.987
T.C., hold 'em
until the police get here.

46:16.128 --> 46:17.322
Dorsey.

46:18.631 --> 46:20.963
I knew I wasn't
gonna get to play.

46:32.578 --> 46:33.806
Dorsey.

46:35.648 --> 46:36.842
How's Clarence?

46:36.916 --> 46:38.850
He's okay.
Where are you going?

46:40.653 --> 46:41.847
Are you nuts?

46:41.921 --> 46:44.151
Dorsey, you gotta start
listening to people.

46:44.223 --> 46:46.384
They're not
treating your shoulder.

46:46.458 --> 46:48.187
It's just painkiller.

46:48.260 --> 46:51.286
You go all out,
you'll rip it apart for good.

46:52.164 --> 46:54.428
Dorsey,
you'll be all washed up.

46:54.500 --> 46:56.024
Tom, I'm 33.

46:56.702 --> 46:59.170
If I don't go out there
and give it another shot,

46:59.238 --> 47:02.366
if I try to wait another year
for this thing to heal,

47:02.441 --> 47:04.272
I'm washed up anyway.

47:04.343 --> 47:05.367
Maybe.

47:05.444 --> 47:08.106
But at least you'll have an
arm hanging from your shoulder.

47:08.180 --> 47:11.172
Listen to them. They want me.

47:12.384 --> 47:14.614
So did that kid
with the rifle.

47:15.321 --> 47:17.186
Dorsey,
you're a human being,

47:17.256 --> 47:18.848
you're not
a piece of merchandise.

47:18.924 --> 47:21.825
Those people don't own you.
Mrs. Greeley doesn't own you.

47:21.894 --> 47:23.327
When it comes
right down to it,

47:23.395 --> 47:24.919
only you own you.

47:24.997 --> 47:26.521
That's right.

47:27.933 --> 47:30.697
You're right, Tom.
You was always right.

47:32.171 --> 47:34.537
But I don't know.
It feels pretty good.

47:34.606 --> 47:37.040
That's just
the lidocaine talking.

47:37.476 --> 47:39.205
Well, what if it's healed?

47:39.278 --> 47:41.576
Dorsey, you know
the odds are against that.

47:41.647 --> 47:43.012
Yeah, I know.

47:43.082 --> 47:44.982
But what if it was you?

47:46.618 --> 47:48.984
What if it was
your last hurrah?

48:01.700 --> 48:02.962
Dorsey.

48:06.338 --> 48:09.603
Double-pump before you throw
to Sibby on a "Y" out.

48:10.042 --> 48:12.567
Dorsey! Dorsey! Dorsey!

48:12.644 --> 48:14.839
Dorsey! Dorsey! Dorsey!

48:14.913 --> 48:16.346
Thanks, Hoss.

48:16.415 --> 48:19.111
Dorsey! Dorsey! Dorsey!

48:19.184 --> 48:20.515
Dorsey! Dorsey!
