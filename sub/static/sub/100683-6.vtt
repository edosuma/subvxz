WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:04.004
The ERA is not about,
uh, equality.

00:05.406 --> 00:06.874
It's about power.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.676
There are more of us
than there are of you.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.345
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.558
NADJA:
Guillermo, I found another one!

00:24.592 --> 00:26.394
(laughs)
Here. Right here.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.062
-LASZLO: Gizmo, here's one.
-Oh!

00:28.096 --> 00:31.699
Come on, boy.
Making it three to the Laszlo.

00:31.732 --> 00:32.766
NANDOR:
Guillermo.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.103
Big one here.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.037
-Right here.
-We are playing a game

00:37.071 --> 00:38.672
-that Guillermo made up.
-It's not a game.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.242
We have been burying bodies
out here for ages,

00:41.275 --> 00:42.910
thus creating sink spots.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.012
It's caused by decomposing
human cadavers.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.215
-It's a wonderful game.
-It's a safety hazard.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.551
I'm winning!

00:50.584 --> 00:52.186
And then my master
came into the room.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.755
It turns out it was Nadja
who had moved the couch, so...

00:54.788 --> 00:56.257
(screams)
What the fuck?!

00:56.290 --> 00:57.358
(screaming)

00:57.391 --> 00:58.592
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

00:58.626 --> 01:00.861
(screams)
What the fuck?!

01:00.894 --> 01:02.796
-Get me out of here!
-(gagging)

01:02.830 --> 01:04.965
("You're Dead"
by Norma Tanega playing)

01:04.998 --> 01:07.435
* Don't sing if you want
to live long *

01:07.468 --> 01:09.937
* They have no use
for your song *

01:09.970 --> 01:12.606
* You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead *

01:12.640 --> 01:15.509
* You're dead
and out of this world *

01:17.077 --> 01:20.114
* Now your hope and compassion
is gone *

01:20.148 --> 01:22.916
* You sold out your dream
to the world *

01:22.950 --> 01:25.219
* Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead *

01:25.253 --> 01:27.921
* You're dead
and out of this world. *

01:37.365 --> 01:39.467
Hey, this one's extra juicy.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.169
I think it's a three-personer.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.070
-Three points for me!
-Ugh, damn it.
-LASZLO: You're wrong.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.673
Graves are worth one.
Three is for the body.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.508
What the...?
Who threw a fucking dagger?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.576
COLIN:
Ooh.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.512
(cackling)

01:51.545 --> 01:52.513
Whoa.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.282
NANDOR:
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

01:54.315 --> 01:57.318
(laughs fiendishly)

01:57.351 --> 02:00.020
I have waited ages for this.

02:00.053 --> 02:03.924
And now
I finally have you cornered.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.994
Please, Mr. Mystery Man,
do not harm me.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.797
If you wish to kill someone,
kill my familiar.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.966
It won't be as satisfying,
but it will be much easier.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.003
Silence!
I am not here for you.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.038
-NADJA: Oh.
-That's a relief.
-Nor you.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.607
Thank you very much.
That's nice.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.042
Scuse me, are you possibly here
to kill me?

02:22.075 --> 02:23.110
-No.
-'Cause if you are,

02:23.143 --> 02:24.812
I just need to run in and...

02:24.845 --> 02:25.813
Silence.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.681
I am here...

02:27.715 --> 02:29.149
for him.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.018
For me?

02:31.051 --> 02:32.853
Well, why the hell
would you be here for me?

02:32.886 --> 02:34.322
And who the hell are you anyway?

02:34.355 --> 02:35.456
(chuckles)

02:35.489 --> 02:38.726
I have gone by so many names,

02:38.759 --> 02:42.730
all of them feared
on the whispers of time.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.565
(chuckles)

02:47.201 --> 02:49.237
Hello, Laszlo.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.239
Uh, hello.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.840
I can see by the look
on your face

02:52.873 --> 02:55.876
you were never expecting
to see me again.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.211
No, you can see
by the look on my face

02:57.245 --> 02:59.046
I haven't got a fucking clue
who the hell you are.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.382
(chuckles)
Nice try.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.751
Like you don't remember
what went down in California.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.356
I rented you a guest room.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.924
Oh, yes.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.861
I did take a brief sojourn
to the Golden State.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.229
I didn't want to go.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.030
Well, you weren't invited.
It was a work trip.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.767
-And I wasn't invited.
-I was-- I had agreed
to meet the Devil

03:19.800 --> 03:21.835
at an intersection
of roadways,

03:21.869 --> 03:24.037
where we'd do a deal
where I would become

03:24.071 --> 03:25.706
a much better guitarist.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.409
I thought the Devil's crossroads
was in Mississippi.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.878
Exactly. I was misinformed.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.746
-Oh, yes.
-Yes, yes, yes.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.181
Are you keeping well?

03:34.214 --> 03:36.350
Not good, Master Cravensworth.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.252
You remember I rented you a room

03:38.286 --> 03:40.688
in my beach house
in San Diego?

03:40.721 --> 03:43.291
-I do. Beautiful part
of the world.
-Yes.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.726
And you skipped out
without paying me

03:45.759 --> 03:47.094
the last month's rent.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.096
-(groans)
-And the security deposit.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.298
-Laszlo.
-Yeah.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.699
'Cause if I remember correctly,

03:51.732 --> 03:52.700
I walked into the john,

03:52.733 --> 03:54.635
and someone had left
a huge floater.

03:54.668 --> 03:58.472
That may be,
but you took me for a fool.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.540
You swindled me.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.577
I have spent
167 years searching for you.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.046
(laughs):
And now, oh-oh-oh...

04:06.079 --> 04:08.215
satisfaction will be mine.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.450
All right.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.419
Either you repay your debt now,

04:11.452 --> 04:13.487
or you will pay with your life.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.156
The money or a duel!

04:16.189 --> 04:18.058
-Pay him. Pay him the money.
-No. No, no.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.793
-Pay him the money.
-Pay him some money.
Just pay the debt.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.128
I'm not paying for shit,

04:21.161 --> 04:23.564
so a duel it is.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.099
-Oh, no.
-NANDOR: Shitting...

04:26.133 --> 04:27.735
Hold this.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.503
-NADJA: Whoo! Go on, Laszlo!
-(both hissing)

04:29.537 --> 04:30.504
NANDOR:
Get it out, get it out.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.105
NADJA:
Very masculine.

04:32.139 --> 04:35.743
That's right.
Scare him with your circles.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.744
COLIN:
Give him hell, Laszlo.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.245
NANDOR:
Okay, okay. Thank you.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.847
(both continue hissing)

04:39.880 --> 04:42.816
What is done tonight
may not be undone.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.352
Do both combatants agree?

04:44.385 --> 04:46.253
Courage and honor.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.357
Aye. Courage and honor.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.259
Then the die is cast.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.161
Both combatants, please,

04:54.194 --> 04:56.196
you will stand back-to-back.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.666
Then you will take ten paces.

04:58.699 --> 04:59.667
Then...

04:59.700 --> 05:01.369
you will unleash hell.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.304
And...

05:04.338 --> 05:06.006
one pace.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.208
Two. Good.
No peeking, now.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.610
Three.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.211
-Four...
-NADJA: Laszlo!

05:11.244 --> 05:13.881
-Laszlo, no!
That's not courageous!
-Bat!

05:13.914 --> 05:15.949
-(horn blaring)
-He's not coming back,
you know.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.785
Are you kidding me?

05:17.818 --> 05:18.986
-NANDOR: Sorry about that.
-(groans)

05:19.019 --> 05:22.322
Oops. He found the big one.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.925
-Cravensworth!
-Yeesh.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.734
LASZLO:
Am I a coward?

05:33.767 --> 05:35.235
Of course not.

05:35.268 --> 05:38.171
There is no honor in defeat.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.807
-(grunts)
-I've never paid the piper

05:39.840 --> 05:41.575
in my life,

05:41.609 --> 05:43.043
and I won't start now.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.678
-(blows)
-I suppose

05:44.712 --> 05:47.214
it won't surprise thee to learn

05:47.247 --> 05:50.217
that I've prepared
for a night such as this.

05:50.250 --> 05:53.754
-So, my sweet angel...
-(exhales sharply)

05:53.787 --> 05:56.924
it is here
that I bid you farewell,

05:56.957 --> 05:59.326
for tonight is the night

05:59.359 --> 06:02.696
that I must disappear forever.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.031
Love,

06:04.064 --> 06:05.733
the man formerly known...

06:05.766 --> 06:07.200
as...

06:07.234 --> 06:08.869
Laszlo.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.906
Forgive me, my darling.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.244
(groans)
There we are.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.480
Blue jeans.

06:20.247 --> 06:21.749
And my toothpick.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.350
My foolproof human disguise

06:23.383 --> 06:26.119
for whenever
the shit hits the wind.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.755
Makes me
completely unrecognizable.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.593
(moos)

06:35.162 --> 06:37.998
(upbeat country music playing)

06:42.335 --> 06:44.638
-How you diddling, Joe-Joe?
-Yep.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.908
Your wife still giving you shit
over that hammock?

06:47.941 --> 06:49.977
After all that nonsense
on Staten Island,

06:50.010 --> 06:52.446
I cut loose to Pennsylvania,

06:52.480 --> 06:54.615
because it sounded
like "Transylvania."

06:54.648 --> 06:56.917
And we all know
that sounds cool.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.152
I infiltrated the township
posing as

06:59.186 --> 07:01.154
your average
American Yankee Doodle Dandy.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.423
And I took over
Lucky Brew's Bar and Grill.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.225
-MAN: Yeah!
-The previous owner,

07:05.258 --> 07:06.460
he mysteriously disappeared--

07:06.494 --> 07:08.095
because I killed him.

07:08.128 --> 07:11.431
-Drinks on the house!
-(shouting, whooping)

07:11.465 --> 07:13.100
And I have not
looked back since.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.235
I now go by the name of Daytona.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.637
Jackie Daytona.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.472
And I'll tell you something.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.408
Jackie Daytona's life,
it ain't so bad.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.110
Not bad at all.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.978
("Simply Irresistible"
by Robert Palmer playing)

07:25.012 --> 07:26.113
MAN:
Yeah!

07:26.146 --> 07:28.949
(others shouting, whooping)

07:30.551 --> 07:33.253
LUCY: I've been in this town
a long time,

07:33.286 --> 07:35.923
and we've never really met
someone like Jackie.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.792
LASZLO:
No one here knows
I'm a vampire,

07:38.826 --> 07:40.460
apart from the people
I've drained and killed,

07:40.494 --> 07:42.095
but they're dead now,
so that problem's

07:42.129 --> 07:43.964
pretty much solved itself.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.799
* That kind of love
is mythical *

07:45.833 --> 07:46.934
This will blow your mind.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.602
-(bass singing)
-Huh?

07:48.636 --> 07:49.770
LUCY:
He has a really big heart.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.038
How the hell does that work?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.706
Hardly anyone cared

07:52.740 --> 07:54.374
about the volleyball team
until he came around.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.909
COACH SWANSON:
Up, up, up!

07:56.977 --> 07:59.446
-(cheering)
-Yeah! Unlucky!

07:59.479 --> 08:01.782
We weren't doing real well.
Uh, we were losing a lot.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.451
* When there's no other course *

08:04.484 --> 08:07.020
And, uh, Jackie Daytona
shows up, and, suddenly,

08:07.054 --> 08:08.556
balls are going
where they're supposed to go.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.223
-You got this. Nice! Set!
-Come on, girls.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.492
I'm pretty sure
he's the X factor.

08:12.526 --> 08:13.794
LASZLO:
There we go!

08:13.827 --> 08:15.362
Superb!

08:16.564 --> 08:17.464
* Simply irresistible *

08:17.497 --> 08:18.966
LASZLO:
While I'm in disguise,

08:18.999 --> 08:20.200
I can't fly.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.170
So I got myself one of these.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.039
Let's go, Bucks.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.576
-(grunting)
-I've truly grown
to love this township.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.578
So I have rid it of
some motor-bicycle criminals.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.512
You better hit the bricks

08:32.546 --> 08:34.481
before I put my foot
up your ass.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.650
WAYNE:
Every year, me and the boys

08:36.684 --> 08:38.852
go on a charity run
to raise money for kids.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.153
We're just on a weekend ride

08:40.187 --> 08:42.389
to raise money
for Toys for Tots.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.858
And he came out of nowhere
and beat the shit out of us.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.828
How 'bout I put this toy
where the moon don't shine?

08:47.861 --> 08:50.030
* She leaves me in awe,
she deserves the applause *

08:50.063 --> 08:51.198
He's really mysterious.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.432
And modest.
He covered up

08:52.465 --> 08:54.034
all the mirrors in the bar.

08:54.067 --> 08:57.437
* But now I find her *

08:57.470 --> 08:59.006
COACH SWANSON:
When you're Jackie Daytona,

08:59.039 --> 09:01.174
you can do whatever you want,
'cause you change lives.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.876
LUCY:
Jackie Daytona really

09:02.910 --> 09:04.044
inspires me.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.614
LASZLO: It may have sprung
from necessity,

09:06.647 --> 09:09.549
but now I feel
as though I may never depart.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.252
* Simply irresistible. *

09:12.285 --> 09:14.454
(crickets chirping)

09:14.487 --> 09:16.256
(indistinct shouting, cheering)

09:16.289 --> 09:17.891
LASZLO:
We made it!

09:17.925 --> 09:19.927
Drinks are on Jackie Daytona!

09:19.960 --> 09:22.029
-(cheering, applause)
-Yes.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.632
Okay, okay, okay, everybody!

09:24.665 --> 09:26.934
Ah, you know,
we've had a rough year.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.268
But tonight...

09:28.301 --> 09:30.537
we qualified for State!

09:30.570 --> 09:32.239
(cheering, whooping)

09:32.272 --> 09:33.874
Great work!

09:33.907 --> 09:35.743
I want to take a second
to thank everybody

09:35.776 --> 09:39.412
and, most of all,
a huge, huge thank you--

09:39.446 --> 09:41.715
yes-- to our friend,
Mr. Jackie Daytona!

09:41.749 --> 09:44.652
ALL:
We love you, Jackie!

09:44.685 --> 09:46.987
Jackie, if it were not for you,

09:47.020 --> 09:48.756
we wouldn't be here.

09:48.789 --> 09:49.990
You're the heart and soul
of this team, sir.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.124
-Yes, you are!
-MAN: Yes, you are.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.393
I am just a regular human guy.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.295
-Oh...
-No, you're not.
-MAN: Come on.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.930
And, unfortunately, now...

09:56.964 --> 09:59.566
I got to deliver
some pretty tough news.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.435
Due to state budget cuts,

10:02.469 --> 10:05.673
we are no longer able to afford
this year's tournament fees.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.676
And, therefore, we...

10:08.709 --> 10:10.443
we're not going to State.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.012
-You what?
-(gasping, murmuring)

10:12.045 --> 10:13.847
I'm so sorry, Jackie.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.282
(gasping)

10:15.315 --> 10:17.651
I need some air!

10:17.685 --> 10:20.020
It makes no sense to me either,

10:20.053 --> 10:22.155
that I would fall in love
with volleyball.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.457
But, you know what,
I've come to love those Bucks.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.626
I love the popcorn,
the squeak

10:26.660 --> 10:29.596
of the tennis shoes
on the court.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.365
And I promised I'd never get
emotional in front of you chaps,

10:32.399 --> 10:33.967
but...

10:34.001 --> 10:37.170
I didn't scrape and murder
my way to Pennsylvania

10:37.204 --> 10:40.507
to watch those talented athletes
get fucked off.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.782
I don't mind saying
I need your help, Billy Bass.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.017
I'm shit out of ideas.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.352
Penny for your thoughts.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.055
I think we'll need more
than a penny, Luce.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.690
Those poor girls,
they didn't deserve that.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.992
You got a big heart, Jackie.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.560
Everyone in this town
knows that.

11:00.593 --> 11:01.628
Mm.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.364
I just wish I understood you.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.066
You're such a mystery.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.235
You say you're from Tucson,
but you talk

11:08.268 --> 11:10.237
all fancy and Europe-like.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.840
This is the way we talk
in Tucson, Arizonia.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.676
If only there was some way
to help that volleyball team.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.012
* She's so fine *

11:19.046 --> 11:22.582
* There's no telling
where the money went *

11:22.615 --> 11:25.352
-* She's all mine... *
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, there.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.087
You never told me
you could sing like that.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.257
Not only that,
you can sing real damn good.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.859
That's given me an idea.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.728
I say, an incredible idea.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.032
Jackie Daytona has
a major-league plan.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.835
Talent show tomorrow,
here in the pub.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.536
We charge five bucks a ticket.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.739
Imagine the amount of money
we'll raise for these girls.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.240
Yes!

11:47.274 --> 11:49.676
This town's full of talent.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.878
He's getting into it.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.445
This is gonna be spectacular.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.281
I know that you're
a first-rate singer.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.248
Talent show.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.283
Lucky Brew's.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.785
Take another one for your wife.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.019
You can do some impersonations.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.053
(imitating Borat):
My wife!

12:00.087 --> 12:01.855
There you go. Henry VIII.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.024
-Support the Bucks.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.692
Take a leaflet.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.194
See you tomorrow?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.395
Come on.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.298
Me, I'm pretty handy
at the old shadow puppetry.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.432
* Like a love revival *

12:12.465 --> 12:13.901
It's very scary.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.902
But watch this.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.636
(laughs):
How do you do that?

12:16.669 --> 12:17.905
LASZLO:
I won't goof it up.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.139
I promise.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.008
You can trust me.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.377
COLIN:
Playing cards

12:24.411 --> 12:26.613
actually were invented
by the Chinese

12:26.646 --> 12:28.581
in the ninth century.

12:28.615 --> 12:29.582
Please shut up.

12:29.616 --> 12:30.951
Nadja, it's your turn.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.753
(crying)

12:36.857 --> 12:39.259
-Yes, you should go speak
to her.
-I can step in.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.061
-No, you can't.
-All right.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.230
I just couldn't sit there
playing games

12:43.263 --> 12:47.234
when my Laszlo is so fragile
and out there just all alone!

12:47.267 --> 12:49.970
He survived this far, so...

12:50.003 --> 12:51.104
-COLIN: Hello.
-Oh, um...

12:51.138 --> 12:52.973
not now, Colin Robinson.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.474
I'm actually just checking in.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.244
You seem to be having
a difficult time

12:57.277 --> 12:59.079
now that Laszlo left you

12:59.112 --> 13:00.280
and is likely dead.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.284
You seem... you know, so lonely.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.854
-(crying): I am so lonely!
-Yeah.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.556
You know,
you don't need to be lonely.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.060
Thanks.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.831
No. No.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.432
-No?
-No.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.768
-No?
-No. No.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.604
(chuckles): No, I wasn't...
actually trying to kiss Nadja.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.707
It's just that
the unwanted kiss rejection

13:27.740 --> 13:29.776
is one of the most awkward

13:29.809 --> 13:31.778
interactions you can have
and, therefore,

13:31.811 --> 13:34.214
the most delicious form
of energy draining.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.816
'Cause I w--
I was getting a bit of a-a vibe.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.385
-No way.
-Okay.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.287
It was like
a Thanksgiving feast.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.821
Mwah. (laughs)

13:41.855 --> 13:43.323
If I wasn't married...
(chuckles)

13:43.356 --> 13:45.492
and you were
a completely different person...

13:45.525 --> 13:49.529
You know, I wanted to check
on all the walls of the house.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.630
See you around.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.199
Every day in every room...

13:52.232 --> 13:53.333
Yeah.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.834
-...on forever.
-I live here.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.669
We're gonna be bumping
into each other a lot.

13:56.703 --> 13:57.871
(chuckles)

13:57.905 --> 13:59.639
So, what's your deal?

13:59.672 --> 14:02.742
I did, however, try to kiss

14:02.775 --> 14:04.577
the Nadja doll, and...

14:04.611 --> 14:07.080
its rejection, uh... stung.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.419
Come on, Joe, drink up.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.888
I don't want
Carol ringing here again.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.758
I'm about to close, friend-o.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.394
Anything quick
I can rustle you...

14:21.428 --> 14:22.662
up?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.498
Uh, one human alcohol beer,
please.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.600
Coming right up.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.237
One human alcohol beer it is.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.105
You don't mind if I join you,
do you?

14:32.139 --> 14:33.173
Please do.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.774
So, what blows you into town?

14:34.807 --> 14:36.109
Oh, just, uh...

14:36.143 --> 14:38.611
passing through.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.913
Judging by that look
on your face,

14:39.947 --> 14:41.448
I'd say there's something
on your mind.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.952
I suppose I can trust you.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.419
After all, you're clearly

14:46.453 --> 14:49.789
just a regular human bartender.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.925
-Mm.
-The jeans, the toothpick.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.693
Salt of the earth.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.894
-(chuckles)
-That's all I am.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.530
Just a regular human

14:57.564 --> 14:59.232
bartender.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.600
Ah.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.103
Mmm.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.871
To tell the truth,

15:04.904 --> 15:07.707
I've been scouring
the area for a while now.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.477
I'm hunting a shady character.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.445
Ah.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.581
-"Shady character," you say?
-Yes.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.782
Great pint.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.450
Laszlo's his name.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.286
A slippery heathen more vile

15:19.319 --> 15:21.388
than the most vile villain.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.890
A pestilence masquerading
as a man.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.558
-A cowardly worm of a person!
-All right, all right,
all right.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.560
I get your point, stranger.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.329
-Sounds like a regular wacko.
-(groans)

15:29.362 --> 15:30.630
A real son of a bitch.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.898
-Yes.
-I'll keep

15:31.931 --> 15:34.001
my peepers peeled for that guy.

15:34.034 --> 15:37.570
Well, then, uh,
I will get out of your hair.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.139
Thank you
for the strong beverage

15:39.172 --> 15:40.340
and your time.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.341
My pleasure.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.943
But if you see anybody

15:43.977 --> 15:46.013
that seems off...

15:47.847 --> 15:49.316
...give me a call.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.351
Nice to meet you,
Jim the Vampire.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.454
How...

15:54.487 --> 15:57.190
did you know my name?

16:00.027 --> 16:03.463
It's printed on your card
very clearly.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.465
Oh. Right.
(laughs)

16:05.498 --> 16:07.934
-Eh, well, good night.
-Good night.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.270
-Oh.
-(chuckles)

16:10.303 --> 16:12.772
That was too fucking close
for comfort.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.475
The smart thing to do now
would be to get out of town.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.477
I mean, that's what
Laszlo would do.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.946
But I'm not Laszlo.
I'm Jackie Daytona.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.382
And I made a promise
to this town.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.157
-LASZLO: Give me a "hell yeah!"
-CROWD: Hell yeah!

16:30.190 --> 16:31.358
(cheering)

16:31.391 --> 16:33.693
Wasn't that something?

16:33.726 --> 16:36.496
Now, listen, I want to thank
everyone for coming down.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.966
We have raised the money
to send these girls to State!

16:39.999 --> 16:41.568
(cheering, applause)

16:41.601 --> 16:43.670
Way to go, Bucks!

16:43.703 --> 16:44.904
You enjoy yourself.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.005
If you want me,
I'll be at the bar.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.674
Take it away, Luce.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.876
(cheering, applause)

16:51.211 --> 16:52.512
LUCY:
Hello, everyone.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.215
I, uh, don't normally do
much singing in public,

16:55.248 --> 16:59.052
but a very good friend gave me
the strength to be up here.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.321
This one's for you, Jackie.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.989
-("Simply Irresistible" playing)
-GIRLS: We love you, Jackie!

17:03.022 --> 17:04.991
(cheering, applause)

17:05.024 --> 17:07.827
* How can it be permissible? *

17:07.860 --> 17:11.064
* Mmm *

17:12.365 --> 17:15.001
* She compromise my principle *

17:15.034 --> 17:17.870
* Yeah... *

17:20.039 --> 17:22.575
I'm guessing the jig is up.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.377
It certainly is,

17:24.411 --> 17:25.878
if by "jig,"

17:25.912 --> 17:28.781
you mean "the varsity
volleyball team's chance

17:28.815 --> 17:31.884
of going to State,"
then, yes, the jig is up.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.053
Oh, you were talking
about the volleyball?

17:34.087 --> 17:35.188
Mm, yes.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.023
-(exhales)
-I read your flyer.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.459
I was so heartbroken
for the team,

17:39.492 --> 17:43.196
I decided to come back and spare
a few bucks to help them out.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.297
(both chuckle)

17:44.331 --> 17:46.199
Even though
I am extremely poor...

17:46.233 --> 17:50.470
-Ah.
-...due to someone
swindling me years ago.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.605
Anyway,

17:52.639 --> 17:55.608
your fundraiser has been
my only source of hope

17:55.642 --> 17:57.544
in a long, long time.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.146
Well, then you'll be pleased
to know that we've raised

17:59.179 --> 18:01.881
enough money to send
the girls to State.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.550
Oh, thank goodness!

18:03.583 --> 18:07.154
You don't know how it warms
my heart to hear that.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.388
(both chuckle)

18:08.421 --> 18:10.457
Would you like a drink,
old-timer?

18:10.490 --> 18:12.925
Yes, I'll have a...

18:12.959 --> 18:16.763
uh, one human alcohol martini,
please.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.898
-Martini? An aristocrat.
-Mm.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.300
-(chuckles)
-I like that.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.002
* The trend is irreversible *

18:28.375 --> 18:29.642
Charlatan!

18:30.643 --> 18:32.011
-(people gasping)
-LASZLO: Oh, shit.

18:32.044 --> 18:35.615
I'm guessing I've come
to the end of the road.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.785
(gasps)
It was you the whole time.

18:38.818 --> 18:42.189
Prepare for your punishment,
Cravensworth.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.824
It will not be swift.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.693
Not without a fight,
me old fruit.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.027
-(both hissing)
-WOMAN: Oh, my God,

18:48.060 --> 18:49.529
-they're vampires!
-(screaming)

18:49.562 --> 18:51.898
(shouting, clamoring)

18:55.835 --> 18:57.837
-WOMAN: Oh, they're gonna
kill each other!
-You had enough, old man?

18:57.870 --> 19:00.106
-(hisses)
-Shit!

19:00.139 --> 19:01.874
(shouts)

19:01.908 --> 19:02.842
(screaming)

19:02.875 --> 19:04.344
(growls)

19:04.377 --> 19:05.678
(groans)

19:07.547 --> 19:08.715
(hissing)

19:10.217 --> 19:11.318
Eh.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.888
(grunting)

19:15.922 --> 19:17.324
(straining, shouting)

19:21.694 --> 19:23.330
JIM:
Oh, that's going
to leave a mark!

19:23.363 --> 19:25.965
Hey, Jim the Vampire,

19:25.998 --> 19:29.035
-you're fired.
-That doesn't even make
any sense.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.837
I don't work for you.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.541
(screaming)

19:34.574 --> 19:36.843
Oh, fire. Now I get it.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.511
-Shit!
-The money for State!

19:38.545 --> 19:40.413
Oh, no!

19:40.447 --> 19:42.014
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-Oh!

19:42.048 --> 19:43.149
No! Get out!

19:43.182 --> 19:44.251
LASZLO:
Hold on, hold on.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.018
I've got this covered.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.654
(groans)
Shit.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.222
JIM (cries):
Oh, no.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.657
Ugh, no.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.959
Look what we've done.

19:55.061 --> 19:59.065
All these years
of obsession and hatred.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.768
-Well...
-You know who the real losers
are in all this?

20:01.801 --> 20:04.203
The girls volleyball team.
That's who.

20:04.237 --> 20:07.840
Kind of puts our whole beef
in perspective, doesn't it?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.243
-I should say it does.
-Mm.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.745
That debt I owe, I shall pay it.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.114
And I shall pay it in full.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.116
Even the most wealthy
of vampires would struggle

20:17.149 --> 20:19.218
-to pay what you owe.
-Ah.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.220
But even the most wealthy
of vampires,

20:21.254 --> 20:22.822
they don't own what I own.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.894
-This.
-What is this?

20:27.927 --> 20:29.529
Do you remember
the Mechanical Turk?

20:29.562 --> 20:30.930
Ooh, yes.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.299
Well, this is the same thing
in fish form.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.733
-(laughs)
-Don't ask me to explain

20:33.766 --> 20:36.303
how it works,
'cause it's unexplainable.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.372
Because there's only one
in the whole world.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.773
-* Will they say
I've spent my life *
-(gasps)

20:40.807 --> 20:42.542
-Look, look.
-Isn't it splendid?

20:42.575 --> 20:46.479
Oh, I have never seen
such beauty.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.481
(laughs)

20:48.515 --> 20:50.283
* Gonna take me down... *

20:50.317 --> 20:53.720
Your debt is paid,
Laszlo Cravensworth.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.488
-Excelsior.
-Excelsior.

20:55.522 --> 20:59.759
And I apologize for
the billiard ball to the head.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.961
-(chuckles)
-Safe passage, sir.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.963
* Still bustin' moves,
still breaking... *

21:03.996 --> 21:05.932
(door opens)

21:05.965 --> 21:07.166
(exhales)

21:08.200 --> 21:09.402
-Lucy.
-(screams)

21:09.436 --> 21:10.937
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.572
I just came to say goodbye.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.807
You're a very sweet girl,
but it never would've worked.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.242
One, I'm married.

21:16.275 --> 21:20.012
Two, I'm a vampire.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.848
Time to get the fuck out
of here.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.553
(engine starts)

21:32.291 --> 21:34.494
Fucking hell!

21:39.131 --> 21:42.101
I never learned to drive,
which is a pity,

21:42.134 --> 21:44.270
'cause that thing cost
a fortune.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.038
Bat!

21:46.072 --> 21:48.307
So it seems that
the winding path of life...

21:48.341 --> 21:49.509
Guess who's back!

21:49.542 --> 21:50.877
...has led me back to myself.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.479
(squealing)

21:52.512 --> 21:54.113
Back to Laszlo.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.615
Yes!

21:55.648 --> 21:57.717
-Everybody, my Laszlo is home!
-(laughs)

21:57.750 --> 21:59.318
Hello, Laszlo.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.820
What? Is that it?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.455
-What?
-I've been gone ages,

22:02.489 --> 22:04.190
and all you can do is,
"Hello, Laszlo"?

22:04.223 --> 22:06.526
Please. You've been away
for, like, one week.

22:06.559 --> 22:09.028
Are you kidding?
I was a different person.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.297
I was Jackie Daytona.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.033
I said "Welcome back," didn't I?
Fucking guy.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.234
-Who cares?
-Let's go.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.303
-To the boudoir.
-(laughs) Ooh!

22:17.336 --> 22:19.005
Run! I'm so horny!

22:19.038 --> 22:20.306
LASZLO:
Some of Jackie Daytona's

22:20.339 --> 22:22.475
good-naturedness
has rubbed off on me.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.310
I set Lucky Brew's ablaze

22:24.343 --> 22:26.312
and picked up
the insurance money

22:26.345 --> 22:28.214
to put
the girls volleyball team

22:28.247 --> 22:29.348
through to State.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.419
Thing is,

22:32.452 --> 22:34.521
one of the waitstaff
was still in the building,

22:34.554 --> 22:37.356
so I had to set fire to another
building to pay for his funeral.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.592
And after hypnotizing
the entire town

22:39.626 --> 22:42.495
into forgetting vampires
ever existed,

22:42.529 --> 22:44.831
I put in a good word
for a new friend.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.999
Nice hustle, Jessica!

22:47.033 --> 22:49.201
Teamwork pays off!
Very good, very good!

22:49.235 --> 22:53.005
Yeah! Don't be afraid
to draw blood.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.607
Yes!

22:54.641 --> 22:55.842
LASZLO:
And you know what?

22:55.875 --> 22:58.077
I think we could all use
a bit of Jackie Daytona

22:58.110 --> 23:00.079
time and again.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.114
Oh, no.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.116
Who the hell are you?

23:04.150 --> 23:07.219
And what on earth
are you doing in my boudoir?

23:07.253 --> 23:10.256
-Relax, my darling. It's me.
-Laszlo!

23:10.289 --> 23:12.592
You scared me half to death.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.126
(gasps)
Oh.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.297
You're back.
So, what is your name, stranger?

23:18.330 --> 23:19.599
My name is Jackie.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.268
-Jackie Daytona.
-(chuckles)

23:22.301 --> 23:24.303
-Come here.
-LASZLO: Ooh.

23:24.336 --> 23:25.938
NADJA:
I want to see
if your other toothpick

23:25.972 --> 23:28.074
-is made of wood.
-(laughs)

23:31.343 --> 23:34.581
* Born to travel *

23:34.614 --> 23:38.050
* Free to roam *

23:38.084 --> 23:39.619
Get ready!

23:39.652 --> 23:41.387
-Oh, no!
-Oh! What the...?

23:41.420 --> 23:42.622
(people gasping)

23:42.655 --> 23:44.056
Oh, no!

23:44.090 --> 23:45.892
My Mechanical Turk!
(crying)

23:45.925 --> 23:47.760
-Hey. (chuckles nervously)
-Oh, no!

23:47.794 --> 23:49.562
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry about it.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.163
You can get those anywhere.
I'll just bring you a new one

23:51.197 --> 23:52.198
tomorrow, okay?

23:54.667 --> 23:59.405
Cravensworth...!

23:59.438 --> 24:02.408
* Born to travel *

24:02.441 --> 24:06.412
* Far and wide *

24:06.445 --> 24:11.484
* It's not the life fit
for a bride *

24:11.518 --> 24:14.253
* 'Cause he's a traveling man *

24:14.286 --> 24:16.623
Since then, I've found out
there's a indie band

24:16.656 --> 24:18.525
also called Jackie Daytona

24:18.558 --> 24:20.459
operating in Texas.

24:20.493 --> 24:21.861
I listened to their music,

24:21.894 --> 24:24.330
and I'm pretty confident
there's no conflict.

24:24.363 --> 24:25.998
And I have to say this,

24:26.032 --> 24:29.001
'cause someone called
Mark from Clearance told me to.

24:30.803 --> 24:35.708
* There's lots of places
to see that's new *

24:35.742 --> 24:39.946
* When you're a traveling man *

24:39.979 --> 24:42.982
* Traveling man *

24:43.015 --> 24:44.984
* Whoa, a traveling man. *

Media Access Group at WGBH

24:52.491 --> 24:54.226
Spirits, uncloak yourselves.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.596
-There's
no such thing as ghosts.
-Okay. Here we go again.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.931
-(warbling)
-(groaning sound)

24:59.031 --> 25:02.068
I think someone summoned
a breakfast burrito.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.270
(up-tempo music plays)

25:05.872 --> 25:06.873
VOCALISTS: Hey!

25:10.109 --> 25:11.243
MAN: This is your station.

25:12.411 --> 25:15.281
But what am I actually
doing here?

25:15.381 --> 25:17.216
I'm not gonna tell you.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.586
Don't worry.
You're gonna figure it out.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.731
MAN: I had no idea
what I would find

25:31.764 --> 25:33.566
when I went searching
for my father.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.368
They flashed the Zodiac Killer,
and my heart stopped.

25:36.402 --> 25:39.105
WOMAN: He believes
he is the son of the Zodiac.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.046
WOMAN: It was 1969.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.781
I was pregnant and scared.

25:48.815 --> 25:52.218
I signed the affidavit
for Roe v. Wade.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.954
She was not the poster girl
that would have been helpful.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.055
What?

25:56.088 --> 25:59.091
-MAN: Born-again Christian.
-Hallelujah!

25:59.125 --> 26:02.962
When you do
what we did to Norma,
you lose your soul.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.165
People are shocked
I've never had an abortion.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.603
This is
my deathbed confession.
