Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:04.557 --> 01:06.192
Tighter.

01:15.834 --> 01:17.603
Alex.

01:29.981 --> 01:32.618
Alex!

02:07.353 --> 02:09.521
I'm going to be late,
Thierry.

03:43.115 --> 03:46.653
<i>Grazie, Signora,</i>
you are on in just a second.

03:53.057 --> 03:56.927
"I gave myself to the strangers
with complete abandon.

03:56.929 --> 04:01.465
Every restraint,
every coercion, every breath,

04:01.467 --> 04:03.767
more challenged
than the last.

04:03.769 --> 04:08.672
When I opened my eyes, I saw my ghost
sharing space with the living.

04:08.674 --> 04:13.109
I measured my lover's gaze
both dangerous and exciting.

04:13.111 --> 04:15.178
The allure to be pulled
into the depths

04:15.180 --> 04:18.817
to dwell in that illusion
forever was...

04:29.028 --> 04:32.562
was at once, overwhelming.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.865
I discovered
that pain and pleasure

04:35.867 --> 04:37.668
can only be found
on the surface.

04:37.670 --> 04:41.074
But love breaks through.

04:43.975 --> 04:46.012
He did not know love.

04:49.113 --> 04:51.817
And I was determined
to find it."

05:01.726 --> 05:03.195
<i>Grazie.</i>

05:34.225 --> 05:35.995
<i>Grazie.</i>

05:39.999 --> 05:42.666
Oh. <i>Grazie. Scusi.</i>

05:42.668 --> 05:44.700
It was a wonderful book.

05:44.702 --> 05:46.738
Thank you. Thank you.

05:54.879 --> 05:59.015
It is you. I was hoping
it was my imagination.

05:59.017 --> 06:01.218
Like a ghost from your book.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.490
Why are you in Italy?

06:04.622 --> 06:06.058
I thought you invited me.

06:07.593 --> 06:10.159
I read your book.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.228
It was excellent.

06:12.230 --> 06:14.163
Of course, you remember
much of it differently.

06:14.165 --> 06:17.199
Oh, you didn't like
how you were portrayed.

06:17.201 --> 06:19.605
I don't know. I don't mind
playing the villain.

06:20.639 --> 06:22.641
To say I didn't love you.

06:30.281 --> 06:32.615
What do you want?

06:32.617 --> 06:33.987
I needed to see you.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.122
Now you have.

06:37.288 --> 06:39.057
Did you miss me?

06:41.259 --> 06:43.260
We were pathetic together.

06:43.262 --> 06:45.697
We were perfect together.

06:46.899 --> 06:48.668
Maybe a little fucked up.

06:51.637 --> 06:55.141
I'm on my way to a villa.
I want you to join me.

06:56.175 --> 07:00.142
A villa? Really?
Absolutely not.

07:00.144 --> 07:03.615
There's some people
you should meet.

07:05.350 --> 07:07.683
I have to be in Rome
by Tuesday.

07:07.685 --> 07:10.954
That's not a problem.

07:10.956 --> 07:13.824
Thierry and I are going to Paris for
the weekend to meet his parents.

07:13.826 --> 07:16.296
My idea's more fun,
I promise.

07:19.163 --> 07:20.897
A gift for tonight.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.036
I know you love the theater.

07:25.036 --> 07:27.336
I'll have a car standing by,

07:27.338 --> 07:29.341
just in case.

07:39.718 --> 07:42.722
Cherie, what are you doing
out here all alone?

07:52.697 --> 07:54.930
<i>Let me ask you a question.</i>

07:54.932 --> 07:58.605
Will you love me more
if I treat you like he did?

08:00.673 --> 08:02.641
Just like a whore.

08:37.109 --> 08:40.142
Oh, so you're leaving?

08:40.144 --> 08:41.913
Sadie, wait.

08:49.053 --> 08:52.824
Sadie, you don't have
to torture yourself anymore.

08:55.259 --> 08:58.328
- Let me fix you.
- I'm not broken!

08:58.330 --> 09:01.000
Without me,
you're completely alone!

11:13.465 --> 11:16.936
So, when was it exactly
you had to be in Paris?

11:17.936 --> 11:19.471
Don't start.

13:17.054 --> 13:18.621
Let's go say hi.

13:28.265 --> 13:31.734
- That was a brilliant performance.
- Thank you, Mr. Zarr.

13:31.736 --> 13:35.271
I'd like to introduce my friend,
Sadie Glass. Sadie, Francesca.

13:35.273 --> 13:39.074
She's on a book tour and I'm trying to
convince her to join me in a country villa.

13:39.076 --> 13:41.143
You have better plans?

13:41.145 --> 13:43.278
Honestly,
it's a little complicated.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.248
And my things
are at the hotel

13:45.250 --> 13:47.483
so I can't go back
there at this moment.

13:47.485 --> 13:50.052
I can have a driver
pick them up.

13:50.054 --> 13:52.957
- You have an answer for everything, don't you?
- You're running out of excuses.

13:57.028 --> 13:59.264
I'll go if you go.

14:00.731 --> 14:03.269
There's room for everybody.

14:08.173 --> 14:11.744
Thank you.
I'll get my things.

14:13.077 --> 14:15.280
I knew you would hit it off.

14:16.347 --> 14:19.050
Did I ruin your romantic plans?

14:21.352 --> 14:23.655
I'm not gonna fuck you.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.028
Well, here's to new beginnings.

14:30.562 --> 14:33.365
Here's to material
for my next book.

15:19.443 --> 15:20.678
Friendly place.

15:24.548 --> 15:28.584
Not really. People here believe the
whole region is cursed by black magic.

15:28.586 --> 15:33.123
Not to mention their excessive Catholic
guilt. It's really a lethal combination.

15:33.125 --> 15:34.791
Sounds exhausting.

15:34.793 --> 15:36.792
I've seen a series of tunnels
running below the town.

15:36.794 --> 15:39.228
Means of escape
for the innocent.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.567
Well, that rules us out,
doesn't it?

15:43.467 --> 15:46.768
Well, we can still use them
to get away from you.

15:46.770 --> 15:49.442
Some say it leads
to the doorway to hell.

15:53.611 --> 15:55.346
Ah, <i>mios dio.</i>

16:52.236 --> 16:54.506
It's beautiful.

16:59.344 --> 17:01.310
Whose place is this?

17:01.312 --> 17:03.148
Business associate's.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.717
I didn't know you could sell
your soul twice.

17:07.719 --> 17:09.888
Well, they're German.
They're not so picky.

17:13.357 --> 17:16.528
Congratulations. You finally
got what you wanted.

17:17.596 --> 17:19.396
Not everything.

17:41.586 --> 17:43.288
Wow!

17:50.694 --> 17:54.396
Why don't the two of you explore and
Minos will take your bags to your room.

17:54.398 --> 17:55.600
Oh.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.272
Sadie.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.547
Sadie!

19:18.549 --> 19:23.452
Have you confessed your sins?

19:23.454 --> 19:25.323
This way.

19:50.013 --> 19:53.484
Hey. Follow.

20:19.144 --> 20:21.643
You want to be an actress.

20:21.645 --> 20:22.944
No.

20:22.946 --> 20:25.581
I want to be a star
in America.

20:27.786 --> 20:32.524
I have sent my audition reel to a few
places, but you have to know people.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.091
What's on your reel?

20:35.093 --> 20:37.062
Monologues I taped myself.

20:38.896 --> 20:40.765
Can you show me one?

20:43.934 --> 20:46.504
Yes. Okay.

20:49.941 --> 20:51.943
Wait. Wait.

21:11.496 --> 21:13.565
Last night, I wept.

21:16.134 --> 21:19.568
I wept because the process

21:19.570 --> 21:23.775
by which I have become
a woman was painful.

21:25.910 --> 21:32.017
I wept because my eyes
were opened to reality.

21:33.550 --> 21:36.621
I wept because
I could not believe anymore.

21:37.255 --> 21:40.189
And I love to believe.

21:40.191 --> 21:44.160
I see that
you understand me and...

21:44.162 --> 21:47.263
and I am afraid.

21:47.265 --> 21:51.937
I have such a fear
of finding another like myself.

21:54.571 --> 21:57.708
And such a desire
to find one.

22:00.178 --> 22:02.944
I am neurotic,

22:02.946 --> 22:06.584
perverted,
destructive, fiery...

22:07.085 --> 22:08.886
dangerous.

22:12.289 --> 22:16.595
Pain is something to master,
not to wallow in.

22:24.903 --> 22:27.239
Thank you
for showing me that.

22:44.188 --> 22:46.822
- The planetarium's a bit much.
- Yes.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.725
You see the turtles?

22:49.727 --> 22:52.096
- Ah.
- Mm.

22:57.234 --> 22:59.170
Thank you.

23:05.910 --> 23:07.642
Aspirin?

23:07.644 --> 23:09.580
- A touch stronger.
- Hm.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.259
Salute.

23:39.743 --> 23:43.345
It's so beautiful.

23:43.347 --> 23:48.249
I remember taking trips to our
family villa when I was young.

23:48.251 --> 23:52.557
But ours was...
a little bigger.

23:55.859 --> 23:56.992
What?

23:56.994 --> 23:58.193
Yeah.

23:59.963 --> 24:03.298
No. No. Don't worry.

24:03.300 --> 24:05.971
I have never even seen
anything like this.

24:12.343 --> 24:15.581
Do you remember that
villa we visited in Provence?

24:16.980 --> 24:18.948
That was beautiful.

24:18.950 --> 24:21.651
Yeah, it was.

24:21.653 --> 24:23.622
Then we went back to Paris.

24:24.655 --> 24:26.021
Yeah.

24:26.023 --> 24:29.124
Ooh, what's happening?

24:29.426 --> 24:31.227
This room...

24:31.229 --> 24:33.395
...is wrong.

24:33.397 --> 24:36.665
There is something wrong
with this room.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.769
Alex?

24:46.778 --> 24:49.010
What was that?

24:49.012 --> 24:51.713
Well, I thought
she'd handle it better.

24:51.715 --> 24:54.182
Do you have any orange juice
or anything to bring her down?

24:54.184 --> 24:57.987
Yeah. In the kitchen
in the basement.

24:57.989 --> 25:01.293
- Can you watch her for me?
- You need to relax.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.967
All right.
Let's get you out of that chair.

26:07.491 --> 26:09.827
Let me help you.

26:11.796 --> 26:12.995
What are you doing here?

26:12.997 --> 26:15.467
You need help, no?

26:28.913 --> 26:31.249
Help me!

27:10.188 --> 27:12.991
Get off me!

29:45.742 --> 29:47.378
Tighter.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.257
As dangerous as ever.

30:05.663 --> 30:07.999
Sadie?

30:10.034 --> 30:12.270
Where are you?

30:21.746 --> 30:24.278
There you are.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.713
Are you okay?

30:25.715 --> 30:28.352
No. You took too long.

30:33.656 --> 30:35.592
I got lost.

30:36.426 --> 30:40.030
Come, piccola. Join me.

31:15.499 --> 31:17.402
Uh-uh.

31:54.270 --> 31:56.771
I see you're both
feeling better.

31:56.773 --> 32:00.177
You two have fun.

32:19.829 --> 32:21.398
<i>Sadie?</i>

32:24.501 --> 32:26.671
There is something wrong?

32:29.673 --> 32:33.211
I left someone back in Turin
and I think it was pretty cruel.

32:37.882 --> 32:40.185
You don't want to be here?

32:41.885 --> 32:43.418
No, I do.

32:45.855 --> 32:48.425
What happened in Paris?

32:56.267 --> 32:58.603
Alex likes to play games...

33:01.438 --> 33:03.842
and I... I took it too far.

33:24.827 --> 33:26.431
Are you okay?

33:27.830 --> 33:31.799
Yeah. Just strange
to be around Alex again.

33:31.801 --> 33:33.834
How'd you sleep?

33:33.836 --> 33:37.608
I had a very vivid dream.

33:39.876 --> 33:41.479
I bet.

33:50.287 --> 33:51.519
<i>Et voila.</i>

33:51.521 --> 33:53.157
Thank you.

33:55.659 --> 33:57.992
I was on a beautiful stage,

33:57.994 --> 34:02.564
performing a play
written just for me.

34:02.566 --> 34:05.670
It felt like the whole world
was watching.

34:07.972 --> 34:10.408
- Was I there?
- Of course.

34:11.375 --> 34:13.577
You wrote the play.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.782
That sounds nice.

34:20.284 --> 34:22.753
Perhaps we can achieve
great things together.

34:29.659 --> 34:31.895
Can I still kiss you?

36:00.451 --> 36:02.920
Shh. Shh. Shh.

36:05.588 --> 36:07.891
Let's try slower.

37:22.032 --> 37:25.566
Your performance
has been wonderful.

37:25.568 --> 37:28.038
There's some people
I'd like you to meet.

37:30.106 --> 37:32.610
Don't worry about her.

38:19.655 --> 38:20.924
Follow.

40:36.226 --> 40:38.159
Did Alex tell you about tonight?

40:38.161 --> 40:39.961
Good afternoon, ladies.

40:39.963 --> 40:43.398
Recovering well?

40:43.400 --> 40:46.700
So just to inform you that the
guests will be here in a few hours.

40:46.702 --> 40:49.237
Oh, <i>mi dio!</i>
I need to sleep.

40:49.239 --> 40:52.076
And I have preparations
to make for the party.

40:53.677 --> 40:55.179
Alex.

40:59.983 --> 41:02.316
What kind of party
are we talking about exactly?

41:02.318 --> 41:05.322
Come on, Sadie.
You know which kind.

41:07.824 --> 41:09.391
Does she?

41:09.393 --> 41:12.260
Relax.
I have everything under control.

41:12.262 --> 41:14.231
Do you?

41:17.067 --> 41:21.202
Still trying to figure out if this
is the place I should be right now.

41:21.204 --> 41:23.807
- It's just a party.
- Yeah.

41:25.108 --> 41:26.911
If you want to leave...

41:27.744 --> 41:29.680
now's the time to do it.

42:31.974 --> 42:34.310
Have you done this before?

42:36.880 --> 42:38.313
Once or twice.

42:38.315 --> 42:43.083
Dear friends,
I'd like to toast

42:43.085 --> 42:45.889
to my friend, Sadie Glass.

42:52.195 --> 42:56.801
To the success of her new memoir
and much more in the future.

43:08.378 --> 43:10.411
I'd like to welcome you all
to this private affair.

43:10.413 --> 43:15.115
This weekend the villa
is a slave, if you like.

43:15.117 --> 43:16.453
Use it as you see fit.

43:18.855 --> 43:21.021
Very good. You know the rules.

43:21.023 --> 43:24.228
There are none. Salute.

43:30.266 --> 43:32.001
Aren't you glad you stayed?

43:32.969 --> 43:35.336
You gonna make me regret it?

43:35.338 --> 43:37.041
Likely.

43:39.041 --> 43:42.142
Our new friend
has really come into her own.

43:42.144 --> 43:44.215
What are you talking about?

44:53.983 --> 44:55.920
Help me!

48:46.516 --> 48:49.452
Alex!

49:24.753 --> 49:27.523
Good morning.

49:28.423 --> 49:30.193
Join me for a game?

49:53.615 --> 49:55.650
It's customary for you
to hit your ball now.

49:55.652 --> 49:58.318
What was that?
Alex, I swear...

49:58.320 --> 50:01.557
If you're not gonna cooperate,
I'm gonna take an extra turn.

50:07.197 --> 50:10.867
- Last night...
- It was just a party like the ones you used to enjoy.

50:12.635 --> 50:14.605
That woman...

50:15.972 --> 50:18.838
There were so many women.

50:18.840 --> 50:20.840
You have to think of it
as a theater, Sadie.

50:26.583 --> 50:28.751
Are you gonna take your turn?

50:35.992 --> 50:37.561
Tell me the truth.

50:40.663 --> 50:43.432
The party this weekend...

50:44.266 --> 50:45.465
it's all for you.

50:45.467 --> 50:47.568
I didn't ask for any of this.

50:47.570 --> 50:50.972
- You lied to me. You tricked me into coming...
- Tricked? No, Sadie.

50:50.974 --> 50:52.974
Coming here was your decision.

50:52.976 --> 50:55.943
I gave you a chance
to leave but you stayed.

50:55.945 --> 50:58.012
And if I try to leave now?

50:58.014 --> 50:59.483
Don't.

51:04.554 --> 51:06.256
It's all right.
Let her through.

51:11.327 --> 51:14.932
Francesca, wake up. I'm leaving
and you need to come with me.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.537
Hey, what's wrong with you?

51:21.938 --> 51:25.639
Maybe the other pill
Alex gave me.

51:25.641 --> 51:28.309
I couldn't sleep.

51:28.311 --> 51:31.280
I had the most beautiful dream.

51:32.882 --> 51:35.749
Mm. Like being reborn.

51:35.751 --> 51:38.619
We're not safe here.

51:38.621 --> 51:40.824
Just don't leave this room.

52:06.516 --> 52:08.382
I need a ride
to the nearest town.

52:08.384 --> 52:10.650
I'm sorry. I'm not supposed
to let anyone leave.

52:10.652 --> 52:12.989
Well, you can't help me then.

52:48.891 --> 52:51.425
- Can you give me a ride?
- Sure. Where do you want to go?

52:51.427 --> 52:53.561
Anywhere. It doesn't matter.
<i>Lontano.</i>

54:10.907 --> 54:13.541
Alex!

54:16.077 --> 54:18.382
<i>Basta!</i>

55:10.833 --> 55:12.199
It's all right.

55:12.201 --> 55:15.905
It's all right.
You're safe. You're safe.

55:16.739 --> 55:18.639
What the fuck was that?

55:18.641 --> 55:21.978
You're fine, Sadie.
It's just games.

55:23.813 --> 55:25.949
Don't try to leave again.

55:28.583 --> 55:32.121
Come on, let's get you
cleaned up. Come on.

56:35.318 --> 56:36.786
There.

56:38.086 --> 56:40.090
That's better.

56:47.730 --> 56:49.796
<i>I'm losing my mind.</i>

56:49.798 --> 56:52.333
Just a few days ago
there was the book tour

56:52.335 --> 56:55.269
and there was Thierry,
now I'm here.

56:55.271 --> 56:59.809
I always feel like I was supposed
to be here, but I don't understand.

57:03.612 --> 57:06.248
That woman last night,
you saw her too, didn't you?

57:07.016 --> 57:08.617
Which one?

57:11.987 --> 57:14.089
What are you afraid of?

57:15.891 --> 57:18.891
Last time
you played games with Alex.

57:18.893 --> 57:20.796
You became this...

57:22.764 --> 57:26.300
Why can't I just let it go?

57:26.302 --> 57:30.173
What am I trying
to let go of?

57:45.721 --> 57:48.157
Maybe you really want
to be here.

57:51.226 --> 57:54.163
And that truth
can be frightening.

57:57.766 --> 58:00.669
Whatever happens
we'll get through it...

58:02.237 --> 58:03.973
together.

58:46.715 --> 58:48.018
Tighter.

59:42.070 --> 59:43.773
Are you okay?

01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:12.167
Hey.

01:00:14.469 --> 01:00:16.138
Hello, Sadie.

01:00:17.273 --> 01:00:20.039
You... Why are...?

01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:21.974
How are you...?

01:00:21.976 --> 01:00:23.110
Are you okay?

01:00:23.112 --> 01:00:25.347
Your room is ready.

01:00:26.481 --> 01:00:28.817
Thank you very much.

01:00:29.885 --> 01:00:31.988
We can still speak soon, yes?

01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:34.456
Okay.

01:00:38.059 --> 01:00:40.063
Right this way.

01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:43.466
What the hell
is he doing here?

01:00:45.067 --> 01:00:47.036
For tonight.

01:01:30.246 --> 01:01:34.284
Means of escape,
for the innocent.

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:45.391
Sadie, there you are.

01:01:45.393 --> 01:01:48.161
I've been angry at myself
the whole weekend, okay?

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:50.900
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry.

01:01:51.567 --> 01:01:53.068
Let's leave this place.

01:01:54.068 --> 01:01:56.369
I can't.

01:01:56.371 --> 01:01:57.604
But you should go.

01:01:57.606 --> 01:01:59.438
Not unless you come with me.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.844
Thierry, this isn't a place
for you.

01:02:03.244 --> 01:02:06.146
I love you, Sadie.

01:02:06.148 --> 01:02:08.916
- I don't want to be with you.
- What is wrong with you?!

01:02:08.918 --> 01:02:12.418
Nothing! Everything! It doesn't matter.
I don't wanna be with you!

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:15.554
I don't wanna meet your fucking parents and
I don't wanna hear you say that you love me

01:02:15.556 --> 01:02:17.657
because it is a lie.

01:02:17.659 --> 01:02:20.961
And it doesn't mean anything
to me anymore.

01:02:20.963 --> 01:02:22.231
<i>Ciao.</i>

01:02:26.434 --> 01:02:28.200
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

01:02:28.202 --> 01:02:29.336
Francesca. <i>Piacere.</i>

01:02:29.338 --> 01:02:31.307
Thierry. <i>Enchante.</i>

01:02:33.442 --> 01:02:36.043
So, you are Thierry?

01:02:36.045 --> 01:02:37.144
Yeah.

01:02:37.146 --> 01:02:39.249
You are here for the party?

01:02:44.286 --> 01:02:49.222
It was nice of you to come after
Sadie ran away from you like that.

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:52.592
- It's complicated.
- Of course.

01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:55.298
We all do insane
things we regret.

01:02:57.166 --> 01:02:59.302
I'm gonna go
to my room now.

01:03:00.702 --> 01:03:03.206
Are you coming with me?

01:03:08.677 --> 01:03:10.980
It was nice to meet you.

01:03:15.317 --> 01:03:18.050
Hey, piccola.

01:03:18.052 --> 01:03:20.155
You're so tense.

01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:24.427
Try to relax, okay?

01:03:26.061 --> 01:03:27.530
Okay.

01:03:50.152 --> 01:03:52.188
It's almost time.

01:03:55.423 --> 01:03:57.326
What if I say no?

01:03:59.661 --> 01:04:01.697
Please don't.

01:04:02.563 --> 01:04:04.567
It'll only hurt more.

01:04:16.445 --> 01:04:18.047
There.

01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:23.050
Why?

01:04:23.052 --> 01:04:26.556
You can't keep running
and not accept what happened.

01:04:28.423 --> 01:04:31.259
I'm here to help you
make a choice.

01:04:40.735 --> 01:04:43.306
Thierry doesn't belong here.

01:04:46.275 --> 01:04:49.746
Let him go
and I will do whatever you want.

01:04:51.146 --> 01:04:52.548
And the dancer?

01:04:54.315 --> 01:04:57.052
You know
you can't save them both.

01:05:18.606 --> 01:05:20.509
Hey.

01:05:22.744 --> 01:05:25.181
I have a small
gift for you.

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:30.353
I stole them from Alex.

01:05:33.288 --> 01:05:35.755
One more night...

01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:39.128
and tomorrow we begin
a new chapter together.

01:05:56.512 --> 01:06:00.249
I need to get ready.
I'll see you very soon.

01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:37.519
Are you ready?

01:07:02.911 --> 01:07:06.615
After tonight, no more games
and no more lies.

01:07:08.684 --> 01:07:11.354
That's for you to decide.

01:08:55.724 --> 01:08:58.792
It's him or us, piccola.

01:10:00.122 --> 01:10:05.728
Shh.

01:10:27.047 --> 01:10:30.183
You can't run away from this,
from yourself.

01:10:30.185 --> 01:10:31.750
You have to do it.

01:10:31.752 --> 01:10:34.187
Sadie, you have to do it.

01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:35.988
Do it!

01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:37.790
Do it!

01:12:54.595 --> 01:12:56.231
Signora...

01:12:57.599 --> 01:12:58.565
come.

01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:10.278
Run.

01:13:43.912 --> 01:13:48.851
<i>Sadie?
Have you confessed your sins?</i>

01:13:52.354 --> 01:13:56.592
<i>Sadie, you don't have
to torture yourself anymore.</i>

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:09.203
<i>Maybe you
really want to be here.</i>

01:14:10.738 --> 01:14:13.274
<i>And that truth
can be frightening.</i>

01:14:21.783 --> 01:14:24.987
<i>You can't keep running
and not accept what happened.</i>

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:04.760
"She gripped tighter.

01:15:07.228 --> 01:15:12.264
<i>Lost in her own pleasure, she
didn't feel his heartbeat cease,</i>

01:15:12.266 --> 01:15:13.935
<i>not at first.</i>

01:15:16.003 --> 01:15:17.840
<i>But he was gone.</i>

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:25.113
<i>That night in Paris
she had lost control.</i>

01:15:43.931 --> 01:15:47.969
And it had cost her...
her greatest love.

01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:06.921
Not a day would pass that she
wouldn't feel that pain.

01:16:09.457 --> 01:16:12.825
It was now her identity.

01:16:12.827 --> 01:16:15.264
She was still afraid
to let go...

01:16:16.797 --> 01:16:18.867
so she gripped tighter.

01:16:23.137 --> 01:16:26.171
<i>Although even in death,</i>

01:16:26.173 --> 01:16:28.176
<i>he found a way to haunt her."</i>

01:16:40.921 --> 01:16:44.959
Pain is something to master.

01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:49.064
Not to wallow in.

01:16:54.969 --> 01:16:57.405
You will come back to us
soon enough.

01:17:04.412 --> 01:17:06.414
It's inescapable.
