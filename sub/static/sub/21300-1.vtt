02:41.100 --> 02:43.840
This is not what we were led to expect.

02:44.057 --> 02:46.109
We were to see the Arno.

02:46.319 --> 02:51.325
The signora wrote
"South rooms with a view, close together".

02:51.538 --> 02:56.544
Instead of which, we have north rooms
without a view and far apart.

03:02.636 --> 03:08.615
Hurry and get dressed or we'll miss
our dinner on top of everything else.

03:08.829 --> 03:13.906
She had no business doing it.
No business at all!

03:22.015 --> 03:26.357
Any nook does for me,
but it is hard that you have no view.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.625
No, you must have a view, too.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.779
- Buonasera.
- Buonasera.

03:30.992 --> 03:34.290
Miss Lavish,
what a recommendation for a place!

03:34.506 --> 03:36.973
Indeed, Miss Alan, it is.

03:37.184 --> 03:43.400
Between the squalor of London and the squalor
of Prato, there is a great gulf fixed.

03:56.633 --> 04:00.346
By going off the track,
you get to know the country,

04:00.564 --> 04:06.093
see the little towns,
Gubbio, Settignano, Galuzzo,

04:06.305 --> 04:09.401
San Gimignano, Monteriggioni.

04:10.167 --> 04:15.067
Their mixture of the primitive
with the classical is irresistible.

04:15.282 --> 04:18.199
- Miss Pole?
- Yes, Mr. Emerson.

04:18.413 --> 04:21.331
What is that you are taking?
It's not lemonade, is it?

04:21.543 --> 04:25.851
- Yes, it is.
- Put it right away, Miss Pole.

04:26.206 --> 04:29.505
Lemonade is very bad for the stomach.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.274
Oh!

04:33.164 --> 04:38.550
I shall tell the signora to give
the next south view available to you.

04:38.766 --> 04:42.135
- Why not to you?
- No, I insist.

04:43.706 --> 04:46.209
This meat has surely been boiled.

04:46.420 --> 04:51.177
For stock. It's lost all its flavor.

04:52.474 --> 04:54.977
Monteriggioni is not only quaint,

04:55.188 --> 04:59.671
but one meets the Italians
in all their simplicity and charm.

04:59.885 --> 05:04.997
Wasn't Monteriggioni
where we saw the cornflowers, Teresa?

05:05.834 --> 05:10.769
An entire carpet of them. It was delightful!

05:10.984 --> 05:15.741
I find the cornflower
the most delightful of flowers.

05:15.993 --> 05:22.766
I prefer something bolder -
the reckless rose, the tempestuous tulip.

05:23.021 --> 05:27.184
- Your mother would never forgive me.
- She'd want you to have it.

05:27.405 --> 05:30.216
On no account. The view of the Arno is yours.

05:30.432 --> 05:34.466
I don't know why we're arguing,
because we have no view.

05:34.676 --> 05:37.902
I have a view. And so does George.

05:39.512 --> 05:42.086
My son George here.

05:42.296 --> 05:48.026
You can have our rooms.
We'll have yours. We can change.

05:48.872 --> 05:52.382
- Why not?
- Thank you very much.

05:52.594 --> 05:56.521
- We could not impose on your kindness.
- Why?

05:56.735 --> 05:58.787
- You see...
- Hush, Lucy.

05:59.762 --> 06:05.977
Women like looking at a view.
Men don't. George, persuade them.

06:06.197 --> 06:09.009
It's obvious they should have the rooms.

06:09.224 --> 06:11.276
- Signora?
- No, thank you.

06:11.486 --> 06:18.295
We could clear out in fifteen minutes.
These niceties go against common sense!

06:18.514 --> 06:25.252
Every kind of sense. I don't care
what I see outside. My vision is within.

06:25.473 --> 06:29.328
Here is where the birds sing
and where the sky is blue.

06:31.143 --> 06:33.195
Come, Lucy.

06:37.059 --> 06:43.488
Let them have the view if they want it.
Why not? George, go after them.

06:44.539 --> 06:47.112
What an impossible person!

06:51.845 --> 06:55.808
- He meant to be kind.
- I know how to deal with these people.

06:56.020 --> 07:00.148
Charlotte, you dealed rudely.
You dealed wrongly.

07:01.239 --> 07:05.367
This pensione is a failure.
Tomorrow we'll change.

07:07.362 --> 07:10.482
- It's Mr. Beebe.
- Who?

07:10.702 --> 07:13.797
Charlotte, we can't change now.

07:15.677 --> 07:18.418
- Mr. Beebe.
- Don't you remember us?

07:18.635 --> 07:21.137
Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch.

07:21.348 --> 07:25.167
- We met at Tunbridge Wells.
- That very cold Easter.

07:25.384 --> 07:27.436
How do you do?

07:27.680 --> 07:33.066
- I heard you are to be our vicar.
- Yes, I move into the rectory in June.

07:34.882 --> 07:38.465
We did feel so sorry for you
in the dining room.

07:38.675 --> 07:42.874
- Mr. Emerson is so tactless.
- But he meant to be kind.

07:43.823 --> 07:48.687
This old gentleman and his son
offered us their rooms with a view.

07:49.182 --> 07:51.234
It was most indelicate!

07:51.931 --> 07:56.758
But things that are indelicate
can sometimes be beautiful.

07:56.975 --> 08:01.946
- Yes!
- I am the chaperone to my young cousin Lucy.

08:02.264 --> 08:08.801
It would be serious if I put her under an
obligation to people of whom I know nothing.

08:09.013 --> 08:13.011
- I wouldn't think much harm could have come.
- There.

08:15.102 --> 08:20.274
You think I ought to have accepted?
You think I have been narrow-minded.

08:20.495 --> 08:23.341
I never suggested that.

08:23.556 --> 08:29.048
If you would allow me, I would be happy
to act as intermediary with Mr. Emerson.

08:29.262 --> 08:33.461
He would not take advantage
nor expect gratitude.

08:33.681 --> 08:37.285
He has rooms he does not value
and thinks you would.

08:37.506 --> 08:39.559
Charlotte, please.

08:39.804 --> 08:43.173
My wishes are unimportant
compared with yours.

08:43.386 --> 08:46.721
I am only here through your kindness.

08:46.936 --> 08:51.278
If you want me to turn these gentlemen
out of their rooms, I will.

08:53.060 --> 08:57.543
Would you, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr...

08:57.965 --> 09:00.018
- Emerson.
- Emerson...

09:02.071 --> 09:04.123
...we accept his offer?

09:14.073 --> 09:17.893
I would like to thank your father personally
for his kindness.

09:18.110 --> 09:21.205
You can't. He's in his bath.

09:26.216 --> 09:28.813
I would have given the larger room to you,

09:29.034 --> 09:33.625
but I happen to know
it was the young man's.

09:33.836 --> 09:37.419
In my small way, I am a woman of the world.

09:37.628 --> 09:40.724
And I know where things can lead.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.342
Whatever does it mean?

10:34.999 --> 10:39.127
Lucy, get dressed or the better part
of the day will be gone.

11:46.671 --> 11:49.767
You said you liked cornflowers.

11:49.977 --> 11:54.211
- So we brought you cornflowers.
- Oh, how kind!

11:54.429 --> 11:58.427
They're your type of flowers.
They have your personality.

11:58.639 --> 12:01.629
I'd like to see them in your hair.

12:01.841 --> 12:06.633
There are no jewels more becoming to a lady.

12:29.744 --> 12:33.290
May I say something rather daring?

12:34.580 --> 12:37.770
Mr. Beebe, you sound like Miss Lavish.

12:37.989 --> 12:43.161
- Are you writing a novel, too?
- If I were, you would be my heroine.

12:43.381 --> 12:49.431
And I should write "If Miss Honeychurch
ever takes to live as she plays...

12:51.349 --> 12:55.797
"...it will be very exciting,
both for us and for her."

13:03.526 --> 13:08.983
Mother doesn't like me playing Beethoven.
She says I'm peevish afterwards.

13:09.197 --> 13:12.352
Naturally, one would be stirred up.

13:13.511 --> 13:15.658
Won't you play some more?

13:15.877 --> 13:17.929
No, I think I'll go out.

13:18.139 --> 13:22.658
Alone? Is that wise, Miss Honeychurch?

13:22.871 --> 13:25.967
To be wise, one might have stayed at home.

13:28.263 --> 13:31.561
I'll not go far. I promise.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.429
I'm sorry.

13:39.535 --> 13:42.240
Whatever's the matter with dear Miss Lucy?

13:42.458 --> 13:45.554
I put it down to too much Beethoven.

13:45.798 --> 13:47.980
I heard her beautiful playing.

13:48.198 --> 13:52.825
Miss Catharine,
you have flowers in your hair.

14:04.237 --> 14:07.333
Buongiorno, buongiorno, Ferdinando!

14:09.422 --> 14:11.474
We salute thee.

14:11.683 --> 14:17.104
The bronze came from Turkish cannons,
captured by the Knights of San Stefano.

14:17.319 --> 14:19.087
Come along.

14:31.306 --> 14:36.241
Stop a minute. Let that man go on
or I shall have to speak to him.

14:36.455 --> 14:38.507
Oh, the British abroad!

14:39.656 --> 14:44.591
I'd set an examination at Dover
and turn back any tourists who failed.

15:27.355 --> 15:33.512
Miss, this sepolcro not very good.
You go see affresci di Giotto.

15:33.723 --> 15:37.507
- Capella Peruzzi, Capella Bardivery good.
- No, thank you.

15:37.724 --> 15:43.939
Giotto scolaro di Cimabue.
Kept the sheep on the mountain.

15:46.421 --> 15:48.473
Make a picture of the sheep.

15:48.683 --> 15:52.954
- No, thank you.
- I very... good speak English.

15:53.172 --> 15:58.343
- Do go away, please.
- Capella Peruzzi, affresci di Giotto...

15:58.563 --> 16:00.675
<i>Cio tuttol</i>

16:10.706 --> 16:16.685
You see here these superb frescoes
by Giotto, depicting the life of St Francis.

16:16.899 --> 16:21.099
On the left, there he is,
renouncing worldly goods.

16:21.317 --> 16:24.544
And, on the right, the fourth Pope.

16:26.536 --> 16:31.293
And here he is preaching to the bishops.

16:31.512 --> 16:38.772
And there he is undergoing a... trial
by fire before the Sultan.

16:38.991 --> 16:40.379
And here...

16:41.045 --> 16:43.097
Ah, Mr. Eager, good morning.

16:43.897 --> 16:48.903
I'm leading a little private tour of my own.

16:51.274 --> 16:54.191
Here he is on his deathbed, surrounded...

16:54.405 --> 16:58.960
Mr. Eager is our English chaplain
here in Florence.

16:59.171 --> 17:02.326
...now unhappily ruined by restoration,

17:02.546 --> 17:08.002
is untroubled by the snares
of anatomy and perspective...

17:08.217 --> 17:13.781
Look at that fat man! He must weigh as much
as I do, but he's floating like a balloon.

17:15.349 --> 17:21.637
Remember that Santa Croce was built by faith
in the full fervor of medievalism.

17:21.855 --> 17:27.241
Built by faith! That simply means
the workers weren't paid properly!

17:31.006 --> 17:36.321
Pardon me. The chapel is somewhat small.
We will incommode you no longer.

17:36.538 --> 17:38.067
Oh, I... Oh!

17:38.277 --> 17:42.583
Mr. Eager, there's plenty of room
for all of us. You don't have to...

17:43.878 --> 17:45.930
Oh, dear.

17:48.158 --> 17:50.518
Gather round, everybody.

17:50.732 --> 17:53.958
You may observe here in the Peruzzi Chapel,

17:54.177 --> 17:57.653
as well as in the place
from which we've been expelled,

17:57.865 --> 18:03.500
the special character of Giotto
among the great painters.

18:03.710 --> 18:06.106
He was practical...

18:06.320 --> 18:11.006
My poor boy has brains,
but he's very muddled.

18:11.225 --> 18:13.407
But why should he be?

18:13.626 --> 18:18.003
Well may you ask.
But think how he's been brought up -

18:18.218 --> 18:22.869
free from the superstition
that leads men to hate in the name of God.

18:24.516 --> 18:26.568
I must go...

18:26.777 --> 18:31.011
I don't require you to fall in love
with my boy, but please help him.

18:32.831 --> 18:35.571
If only one could stop him from brooding.

18:36.971 --> 18:40.518
And on what? The things of the universe.

18:43.130 --> 18:46.640
I don't believe in this world sorrow. Do you?

18:46.852 --> 18:50.530
No, I don't. Not at all, Mr. Emerson.

18:50.749 --> 18:56.478
Well, there you are.
Make my boy realize that,

18:56.698 --> 19:01.941
at the side of the everlasting "why",
there is a "yes".

19:02.160 --> 19:04.212
And a "yes" and a "yes"!

19:05.605 --> 19:08.487
Has your son no particular hobby?

19:08.701 --> 19:10.753
I forget my worries at the piano,

19:10.963 --> 19:14.023
and collecting stamps helped my brother.

19:14.268 --> 19:19.416
Excuse me. My cousin will be
most anxious if I don't get back.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.650
- Poor girl.
- Poor girl?

19:22.861 --> 19:28.982
I think myself most fortunate.
I'm very happy and having a splendid time.

19:29.193 --> 19:32.289
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

19:51.356 --> 19:56.920
Look at that adorable wine cart.
How he stares at us, dear simple soul!

19:57.132 --> 19:59.837
I love these little dark alleys.

20:01.515 --> 20:05.062
They're all peasants, you know. Come along.

20:12.648 --> 20:14.701
I do declare we're lost.

20:17.902 --> 20:22.279
No, Miss Bartlett,
you will not look into your Baedeker.

20:22.495 --> 20:27.358
Two lone females in an unknown city,
that's what I call an adventure.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.626
We will simply drift.

20:34.185 --> 20:37.898
One always has to be wide open.
I think Miss Lucy is.

20:38.117 --> 20:41.865
- Open to what, Miss Lavish?
- To physical sensation.

20:42.082 --> 20:46.673
I'll let you into a secret.
I have my eye on your cousin.

20:46.884 --> 20:49.209
For a character in your novel?

20:49.424 --> 20:52.793
The young English girl, transfigured by Italy.

20:53.007 --> 20:56.305
And why should she not be transfigured?

20:56.521 --> 20:58.668
It happened to the Goths.

21:05.463 --> 21:07.515
Signorina?

21:09.916 --> 21:11.755
The smell!

21:11.968 --> 21:16.096
A true Florentine smell. Inhale, my dear.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.370
Deeper.

21:18.718 --> 21:22.502
Every city, let me tell you, has its own smell.

21:25.711 --> 21:27.763
Grazie.

23:34.406 --> 23:36.458
How are you now?

23:38.721 --> 23:42.398
Perfectly well. Absolutely well.

23:42.617 --> 23:44.669
Then, let's go home.

23:45.470 --> 23:48.460
There's no point in our stopping.

23:49.994 --> 23:53.433
How very kind you've been.
I can go alone. Thank you.

23:55.177 --> 23:58.760
- My photographs!
- What photographs?

23:58.969 --> 24:04.141
I must have dropped them
in the square. Would you be so kind...?

24:14.834 --> 24:17.123
Miss Honeychurch!

24:19.357 --> 24:21.409
You're not fit enough to go alone.

24:21.653 --> 24:24.773
- I am.
- No, you're not!

24:24.994 --> 24:27.699
- But...
- Then I don't get the photographs.

24:28.508 --> 24:31.948
Besides, that way,
you'd have to fly over the wall.

24:32.161 --> 24:35.422
Sit down and don't move until I come back.

25:59.662 --> 26:01.774
Isn't it extraordinary?

26:01.994 --> 26:08.566
I mean, Italians are so kind, so lovable,
and yet at the same time so violent.

26:11.109 --> 26:12.639
Mr. Emerson?

26:14.866 --> 26:19.729
I've never been so ashamed.
I can't think what came over me.

26:19.946 --> 26:23.836
It's perfectly natural.
I nearly fainted myself.

26:24.155 --> 26:27.869
Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.

26:28.088 --> 26:33.200
And... I want to ask you a great favor.

26:33.411 --> 26:35.984
You know how silly people are.

26:37.099 --> 26:39.151
Gossiping.

26:41.204 --> 26:43.457
Ladies especially, I'm afraid.

26:44.718 --> 26:48.502
- You understand what I mean?
- No.

26:50.423 --> 26:55.595
I mean, would you not mention it to anyone,
my foolish behavior.

27:01.801 --> 27:05.406
What was that?
I believe it was my photographs!

27:05.627 --> 27:09.660
I didn't know what to do with them.
They were covered with blood.

27:09.872 --> 27:13.063
There. Now I've told you.

27:17.561 --> 27:20.657
Something tremendous has happened.

27:22.815 --> 27:26.184
Well, thank you... again.

27:27.269 --> 27:31.860
How quickly accidents happen.
Then one returns to the old life.

27:32.069 --> 27:34.121
I don't.

27:34.331 --> 27:38.151
I mean... something's happened to me.

27:38.366 --> 27:40.655
And to you.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.796
- No!
- She is my sister.

28:10.271 --> 28:13.497
- We ought not to allow this.
- They're doing no harm.

28:13.715 --> 28:16.218
You can't object in such a landscape.

28:17.091 --> 28:19.379
As long as she is his sister.

28:20.917 --> 28:25.923
So, Miss Honeychurch, you're traveling.
As a student of art?

28:26.136 --> 28:31.522
- No, I'm afraid not.
- As a student of human nature like myself?

28:31.772 --> 28:34.369
- I'm here as a tourist.
- Indeed?

28:35.252 --> 28:40.008
We residents sometimes pity
you poor tourists not a little.

28:40.226 --> 28:44.081
Handed about like parcels
from Venice to Florence to Rome,

28:44.819 --> 28:51.072
unconscious of anything outside Baedeker,
anxious to get done and go on elsewhere.

28:51.291 --> 28:55.359
I abhor Baedeker.
I'd fling every copy in the Arno.

28:55.570 --> 29:01.098
Towns, rivers, palaces,
all mixed up in an inextricable whirl.

29:04.372 --> 29:06.519
Over there, Miss Honeychurch,

29:07.399 --> 29:09.902
the villa of my dear friend Lady Laverstock,

29:10.113 --> 29:13.446
at present busy
with a Fra Angelico definitive study.

29:14.532 --> 29:18.137
And, on your left - no, just there -

29:19.124 --> 29:22.219
Mr. Henry Burridge lives.

29:22.812 --> 29:25.801
An American of the best type. So rare!

29:26.013 --> 29:29.868
Doubtless you know his monographs
in "Medieval Byways".

29:38.468 --> 29:42.181
Your father, Mr. Emerson, is a journalist?

29:42.400 --> 29:46.362
- He used to be.
- He's retired? And you, yourself?

29:46.575 --> 29:48.627
I'm on the railways.

29:49.741 --> 29:53.525
You know the American girl
in "Punch" who says to her father,

29:53.742 --> 29:56.315
"Say, Poppa, what did we see in Rome?"

29:56.526 --> 30:01.698
The father replies,
"Guess Rome was where we saw the yellow dog."

30:01.918 --> 30:04.420
Yellow dog!

30:05.327 --> 30:07.653
There's traveling for you!

30:07.867 --> 30:10.050
What?! Stop at once!

30:16.740 --> 30:18.792
I'm not having this.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.326
Ferma la carrozza subitol

30:21.540 --> 30:23.616
Have we bolted?

30:36.501 --> 30:40.084
What? Is Phaethon misbehaving
with his Persephone?

30:40.294 --> 30:43.248
- Please, I'll deal with them.
- Leave them.

30:43.459 --> 30:47.137
Do we find happiness
so often that we should turn it away?

30:47.843 --> 30:49.266
Scendal

32:02.472 --> 32:04.524
Beauty!

32:09.395 --> 32:11.448
Espoirl

32:12.979 --> 32:15.340
Is that your son?

32:15.554 --> 32:19.788
Could that be the silent, dour George?

32:20.286 --> 32:22.338
He's saying his creed.

32:25.434 --> 32:29.563
One more lump,
if I might trouble you, Mr. Beebe.

32:30.201 --> 32:32.253
Joy!

32:32.845 --> 32:34.897
Beauty!

32:36.046 --> 32:38.098
Joy...!

32:39.943 --> 32:42.410
He's declaring the eternal "yes".

32:42.622 --> 32:45.717
And a spoon, if there is one.

32:47.109 --> 32:49.956
Love!

32:50.172 --> 32:54.929
- What's that?
- The gentlemen are doubtless having a game.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.744
Why don't you join them, dear?

32:57.965 --> 33:00.112
I want to stop here with you.

33:00.331 --> 33:05.123
Observe my foresight. I never venture forth
without my mackintosh squares.

33:05.340 --> 33:10.512
At any time, one may have to sit
on damp ground or cold marble.

33:12.021 --> 33:14.523
Lucy, you have the other one.

33:14.734 --> 33:18.897
Come on, I insist. The ground will do for me.

33:20.162 --> 33:25.370
I have not had rheumatism for years,
and if I feel a twinge I'll stand up.

33:27.747 --> 33:30.249
And she never went back to Weybridge?

33:30.460 --> 33:34.944
Her friend had to return without her.
She remained at Monteriano.

33:35.158 --> 33:37.210
And did she really...?

33:45.073 --> 33:48.192
No, no. Don't be alarmed. This is not a cold.

33:48.413 --> 33:51.568
Just a slight cough.
I've had it for three days.

33:51.822 --> 33:54.562
Nothing to do with sitting on the ground.

33:54.779 --> 33:57.875
I shall go and find Mr. Beebe.

33:58.085 --> 34:02.082
Oh, do, dear. He will be so pleased.

34:06.539 --> 34:11.130
- Did she really marry this Italian?
- In the church at Monteriano.

34:11.341 --> 34:15.469
A youth. Ten years younger than herself.

34:16.734 --> 34:18.085
Eleanor!

34:18.299 --> 34:23.578
PUCCINI'S "CHI IL BEL SOGNO
DI DORETTA" FROM "LA RONDINE")

34:30.476 --> 34:31.829
Excuse me.

34:33.886 --> 34:35.938
Dove Mr. Beebe?

34:39.522 --> 34:42.096
Buoni uomini?

34:54.030 --> 34:57.957
I think there is something
in the Italian landscape

34:58.171 --> 35:01.646
which inclines
even the most stolid to romance.

35:01.858 --> 35:06.057
It reminds me somewhat
of the country around Shropshire.

35:06.277 --> 35:11.449
Where I once spent a holiday
at the home of my friend Miss Apesbury.

35:13.271 --> 35:18.312
And I divine it, Charlotte.
You had an adventure there.

35:18.524 --> 35:20.576
Vain to deny it.

36:51.140 --> 36:52.836
Lucy!

37:10.206 --> 37:16.421
Mr. Eager, do come and join us.
Miss Honeychurch is feeling unwell.

37:19.982 --> 37:22.449
Andiamo.

37:29.758 --> 37:31.811
Andiamol

37:32.159 --> 37:34.211
George. George.

37:36.091 --> 37:40.053
- Aren't you coming with us?
- I'll walk.

37:42.492 --> 37:44.544
Are you sure?

38:28.766 --> 38:31.648
Courage, Miss Honeychurch, and faith.

38:31.862 --> 38:37.391
Do you suppose this display is called
into existence to extinguish you or me?

38:37.603 --> 38:42.086
Even scientifically, the chances
against being struck are enormous.

38:42.300 --> 38:47.128
The steel knives that might attract
the current are in the other carriage.

38:54.581 --> 38:56.278
What is to be done?

38:56.843 --> 38:59.760
How do you propose to silence him?

39:01.018 --> 39:05.252
- The driver?
- My dear girl, no. Mr. George Emerson.

39:07.141 --> 39:11.589
I don't wish to be uncharitable,
but I know he will talk.

39:11.804 --> 39:14.377
He will not. He never talks.

39:14.551 --> 39:18.513
One's lucky to get
as much as a "yes" or "no" out of him.

39:18.726 --> 39:22.961
Unfortunately, I have met the type before.

39:23.980 --> 39:27.420
They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.685
Exploits?

39:31.704 --> 39:35.631
Very well. I'll speak to him.

39:36.922 --> 39:41.051
Oh, no, my dear Lucy.
I think it is for me to do that.

39:45.098 --> 39:48.645
He should have been here
at least an hour ago.

39:49.483 --> 39:54.655
Don't stand there, dear.
You will be seen from the outside.

39:57.136 --> 40:00.327
The moment he comes, I shall face him.

40:00.546 --> 40:03.286
No, my dear, you will do no such thing.

40:04.547 --> 40:07.050
My poor dear girl, you are so young!

40:07.261 --> 40:13.904
You've always lived among such nice people.
You cannot realize what men can be.

40:14.115 --> 40:18.634
This afternoon, if I had not arrived,
what would have happened?

40:18.847 --> 40:22.560
- I can't think.
- Answer me, Lucia.

40:22.779 --> 40:25.104
What would have happened had I not appeared?

40:26.849 --> 40:29.245
You did appear!

40:29.459 --> 40:32.413
Oh, I have vexed you at every turn.

40:32.624 --> 40:37.831
It's true.
I am too old for you. And too dull.

40:39.756 --> 40:42.876
It will be a push to catch the morning train.

40:44.384 --> 40:49.627
I have failed in my duty to your mother.
She will never forgive me when you tell her.

40:49.847 --> 40:52.622
Come away from the window!

40:52.838 --> 40:56.207
She will certainly blame me
when she hears of it.

40:56.422 --> 40:58.474
Certainly.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.092
And deservedly.

41:02.997 --> 41:09.806
- Why need Mother hear of it?
- Well, you tell her everything. Don't you?

41:10.408 --> 41:12.697
I suppose I do, generally.

41:12.914 --> 41:16.876
There's such a beautiful confidence
between you.

41:17.089 --> 41:19.141
One would hate to break it.

41:19.802 --> 41:22.375
And, as I've said before, I am to blame.

41:22.550 --> 41:24.946
I wouldn't want Mother to think so.

41:25.160 --> 41:28.766
She will think so... if you tell her.

41:29.857 --> 41:33.190
I shall never speak of it to Mother or anyone.

41:36.746 --> 41:40.874
We'll both be as silent as the grave.

41:41.512 --> 41:46.684
You'd better get to bed, dear.
We have to make an early start.

41:49.723 --> 41:52.748
But, of course, we have not had a full week.

41:52.959 --> 41:56.600
I reserved them for a week
like you wrote you wanted.

41:56.821 --> 42:02.171
Yes, but we've only had half a week,
so I calculate we owe you half the price.

42:02.387 --> 42:07.014
I'm the loser.
I could have let them rooms five times over.

42:31.265 --> 42:34.290
Buonasera. Grazie.

42:48.556 --> 42:52.755
Lucy! We must get packed immediately!

42:54.679 --> 42:59.851
I wish to have a word with you,
Mr. Emerson, in the drawing room, please.

43:22.896 --> 43:26.823
- You shouldn't peep.
- Cecil asked my permission,

43:27.036 --> 43:29.396
but he can't manage without me.

43:29.611 --> 43:31.663
- Nor me.
- You?

43:31.872 --> 43:35.205
- He asked my permission also.
- Whatever did you say?

43:35.421 --> 43:37.497
- I said no.
- What?!

43:37.717 --> 43:43.032
It's the way he put it - wouldn't it be
a splendid thing for Lucy if he married her?

43:43.249 --> 43:48.006
Wasn't I off my head with joy?
So I said no, I wasn't.

43:48.225 --> 43:54.417
Ridiculous child. You think you're so holy
and truthful, but it's just conceit.

43:54.626 --> 43:57.199
Look out!

43:58.070 --> 44:00.122
I promessi sposel

44:03.463 --> 44:07.460
- She has accepted me.
- I'm so glad.

44:07.673 --> 44:11.636
Dear Cecil, what joy!

44:11.848 --> 44:15.881
- Well, welcome as one of the family.
- Thank you.

44:19.328 --> 44:22.874
- Mother?
- Lucy.

44:37.524 --> 44:39.671
Freddy!

44:43.822 --> 44:46.040
- Mr. Beebe.
- Thank you, Mary.

44:46.257 --> 44:50.420
Hello, Mr. Vyse, I've come for tea.
Do you suppose I shall get it?

44:50.640 --> 44:53.416
Food is the one thing one does get here.

44:54.781 --> 44:58.814
- What an extraordinary thing!
- One of Freddy's bones.

44:59.060 --> 45:05.739
He's terrible. A most unpromising youth.
So unlike his sister.

45:05.949 --> 45:08.619
You think his sister is promising?

45:08.837 --> 45:11.932
I have a pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.

45:12.142 --> 45:20.411
Is it not odd that she should play Beethoven
with such passion and live so quietly?

45:20.632 --> 45:23.337
I suspect that one day...

45:25.189 --> 45:28.488
...music and life will mingle.

45:28.703 --> 45:31.444
Then she will be wonderful in both.

45:31.661 --> 45:37.781
I trust that day is at hand.
She has just promised to marry me.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.998
I'm sorry if I've given you a shock.

45:43.212 --> 45:47.139
I'm awfully sorry.
I'd no idea you were so intimate with her.

45:47.351 --> 45:51.420
You should have stopped me.
Shall we join the others?

45:54.832 --> 45:56.884
Congratulations.

45:57.198 --> 46:00.293
Blessings. Your vicar's benediction.

46:01.511 --> 46:04.181
I want you to be supremely happy.

46:04.400 --> 46:09.227
And supremely good,
both as man and wife, mother and father.

46:09.444 --> 46:11.496
And now I want my tea.

46:11.706 --> 46:15.596
Just in time. How dare you be so serious!

46:20.577 --> 46:25.619
- Summer Street will never be the same.
- It's too small for anyone like ourselves.

46:25.832 --> 46:29.545
It might attract the wrong type.
The trains have improved so.

46:29.763 --> 46:34.590
Fatal. What are five miles
from the station these days?

46:35.086 --> 46:38.075
Sir Harry, how about spinsters as tenants?

46:38.287 --> 46:41.442
Most certainly!
That is, if they are gentlewomen.

46:41.662 --> 46:47.878
Indeed they are. Miss Teresa
and Miss Catharine Alan. I met them in Italy.

46:48.376 --> 46:53.726
Sir Harry, beware of these gentlewomen.
Only let to a man.

46:53.943 --> 46:55.995
Provided, of course, he's clean.

46:56.205 --> 46:58.257
You'd love the Miss Alans.

46:58.466 --> 47:02.393
I don't think I'd like anyone at that pensione.

47:02.606 --> 47:07.612
Wasn't there a lady novelist
and a free-thinking father and son?

47:07.860 --> 47:12.131
I have no profession.
My attitude - quite indefensible -

47:12.382 --> 47:15.965
is that, if I trouble no one, I may do as I like.

47:16.175 --> 47:19.271
It is, I dare say, an example of my decadence.

47:19.515 --> 47:24.236
You're very fortunate.
Leisure is a wonderful opportunity.

47:26.091 --> 47:31.619
Don't slouch, Lucy. Go and talk
to Mrs. Pool. Ask her about her leg.

47:31.831 --> 47:35.721
Would Cecil and I be missed
if we went for a walk?

47:35.937 --> 47:41.109
I think it would be all right.
Don't get your frock muddied.

48:00.012 --> 48:05.220
It's disgusting the way an engagement
is regarded as public property.

48:05.440 --> 48:08.429
All those old women smirking.

48:08.641 --> 48:12.603
One has to go through it.
They won't notice us much next time.

48:12.816 --> 48:15.912
But their whole attitude is wrong.

48:16.121 --> 48:19.111
An engagement -
horrid word in the first place -

48:19.322 --> 48:22.928
is a private matter
and should be regarded as such.

48:23.149 --> 48:25.403
Oh.

48:25.619 --> 48:30.210
- There's your philosophizing parson.
- Don't you like Mr. Beebe?

48:30.421 --> 48:34.311
I never said so.
I consider him far above the average.

48:35.326 --> 48:37.687
Mr. Beebe, I've had a wonderful idea.

48:37.902 --> 48:43.501
I'm going to write to our Miss Alans
and ask them to take Sir Harry's villa.

48:43.712 --> 48:47.674
Sir Harry deserves a tenant
as vulgar as himself.

48:47.887 --> 48:50.591
Oh, Mr. Vyse, he's really very nice.

48:51.575 --> 48:53.828
Gentlewomen! Yuck!

48:54.045 --> 48:57.758
Acting the little god down here
with his patronage

48:58.010 --> 49:01.937
and his sham aesthetics,
and everyone is taken in.

49:02.151 --> 49:05.247
I'll write to them,
and if you'd also send a word?

49:05.456 --> 49:10.985
Certainly. A highly suitable
addition to our little community.

49:11.196 --> 49:14.292
Goodness, how cross you are!

49:18.712 --> 49:23.612
It was that miserable tea party
and all those dreadful people.

49:23.827 --> 49:25.879
And not being alone with you.

49:26.087 --> 49:27.961
Hmm.

49:48.076 --> 49:53.153
Italy and London are the places
where I feel I truly belong.

49:53.365 --> 49:57.493
I am something of an Inglese Italianato.

49:57.714 --> 50:01.842
E un diavolo incarnato.
You know the proverb?

50:06.377 --> 50:10.505
I somehow think you feel
more at home with me in a room.

50:10.760 --> 50:13.192
Never in the real country like this.

50:14.136 --> 50:19.735
I think you're right. When I do think of you,
it is always in a room.

50:21.685 --> 50:23.737
This is the Sacred Lake.

50:24.399 --> 50:29.571
Very picturesque, but hardly a lake.
More of a puddle.

50:30.904 --> 50:35.033
Freddy loves to bathe here.
He's very fond of it.

50:35.254 --> 50:37.306
And you?

50:38.002 --> 50:40.054
I used to bathe here, too.

50:41.029 --> 50:43.081
Until I was found out.

50:44.683 --> 50:46.735
- Lucy.
- Hmm?

50:46.945 --> 50:49.899
Yes, I suppose we ought to be going.

50:54.007 --> 50:59.179
I want to ask you something
that I have never asked before.

50:59.504 --> 51:01.556
What, Cecil?

51:02.148 --> 51:04.200
Yes?

51:04.479 --> 51:06.531
I have never kissed you.

51:08.619 --> 51:10.671
No. You haven't.

51:12.829 --> 51:14.976
May I now?

51:15.195 --> 51:17.271
Well, of course you may, Cecil.

51:17.491 --> 51:20.266
You might before. I can't run at you.

51:46.577 --> 51:48.629
I'm sorry.

52:09.679 --> 52:13.842
Mother's right. Those people
Charlotte and I met at the pensione,

52:14.063 --> 52:16.803
they were all rather extraordinary.

52:28.710 --> 52:31.486
0ur neighbor and friend, Sir Harry 0tway,

52:31.703 --> 52:35.771
has a villa in Summer Street
for which he needs a tenant.

52:35.982 --> 52:40.882
- I immediately thought of you.
- "The house has the added attraction

52:41.097 --> 52:46.103
"that it stands exactly across the road
from the Reverend Beebe's church.

52:46.315 --> 52:51.772
"I told him of my plan to lure you hither,
and he is in complete agreement

52:51.986 --> 52:58.143
"and says he is writing today to urge you
to consider our little corner of Surrey.

52:58.352 --> 53:02.480
"Yours sincerely, Lucy Honeychurch." There.

54:11.938 --> 54:14.642
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

54:14.965 --> 54:17.076
Oh, dear.

54:19.696 --> 54:21.748
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

54:25.298 --> 54:27.350
Goodnight. See you Friday.

54:27.560 --> 54:31.688
- That will be all, Rose. Thank you.
- Thank you, madam.

54:31.908 --> 54:34.304
Goodnight, Rose.

54:34.518 --> 54:38.480
Make Lucy one of us.
Lucy's becoming wonderful.

54:38.693 --> 54:40.910
Her music always was wonderful.

54:41.128 --> 54:45.885
But she's purging off that Honeychurch taint.
You know what I mean.

54:46.103 --> 54:51.145
Not quoting the servants
or asking how the pudding is made.

54:51.356 --> 54:54.274
Mind you marry her next January.

54:54.488 --> 54:57.857
Her music, the style of her...

54:58.071 --> 55:02.757
how she kept to Schubert when,
like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.

55:02.977 --> 55:05.551
Schubert was right for this evening.

55:06.665 --> 55:11.043
Mother, I shall have our children
educated just like Lucy.

55:11.258 --> 55:15.042
Bring them up among honest country folk
for freshness,

55:15.258 --> 55:19.980
send them to Italy for... subtlety.

55:20.199 --> 55:23.497
And not till then bring them to London.

55:24.305 --> 55:27.401
Not a day beyond January.

55:38.535 --> 55:42.948
Cecil... darling.

55:44.171 --> 55:47.267
So, you do love me, little thing?

56:30.444 --> 56:32.141
Lucy!

56:33.019 --> 56:36.317
I want to show her this letter
from the Miss Alans.

56:36.533 --> 56:40.281
The tiresome Miss Alans.
I hate their "if"-ing and "but"-ing.

56:40.534 --> 56:43.523
Well, now they're really coming.

56:43.735 --> 56:49.085
I had a letter from Miss Teresa
asking how often the butcher called.

56:49.301 --> 56:52.290
My reply impressed her favorably. Lucy?

56:52.502 --> 56:55.491
Go for her. Get her round the shins.

56:56.050 --> 57:00.641
- Freddy, be careful!
- You really are savages, you know.

57:02.244 --> 57:07.451
Impossible to make oneself heard.
Don't you want to hear about the Miss Alans?

57:07.671 --> 57:10.518
- Who?
- Sir Harry's new tenants.

57:10.733 --> 57:13.330
- That wasn't the name.
- Wasn't whose name?

57:14.142 --> 57:18.970
Sir Harry's tenants.
I met him this morning and he said,

57:19.187 --> 57:22.733
"I have procured desirable tenants."

57:22.945 --> 57:25.791
I said, "Hurray,"
and slapped him on the back.

57:26.006 --> 57:30.134
- Exactly. The Miss Alans.
- More like Anderson.

57:30.678 --> 57:34.391
I knew there'd be another muddle.
I'm always right.

57:34.609 --> 57:38.737
Only Freddy's muddle,
who doesn't even know their name.

57:38.958 --> 57:43.086
Yes, I do. I've got it. It was Emerson.

57:44.281 --> 57:50.402
- What a weathercock Sir Harry is.
- I hope they're the right kind of people.

57:50.613 --> 57:54.291
Yes, Freddy,
there is a right and a wrong sort.

57:54.510 --> 57:58.093
These must be all right.
They're friends of Cecil's.

57:58.302 --> 58:03.237
- Cecil?
- So you can all call in perfect safety.

58:03.451 --> 58:06.891
- Cecil?!
- We met some Emersons in Florence.

58:07.105 --> 58:12.870
The oddest people, Mrs. Honeychurch,
but we rather liked them.

58:13.089 --> 58:16.185
Emerson's a common enough name.

58:17.577 --> 58:21.574
"So really desirable. I've telegraphed them."

58:21.787 --> 58:25.085
Don't be silly, Freddy. You always overdo it.

58:25.788 --> 58:28.421
A most remarkable father and son.

58:28.641 --> 58:34.133
Father's something of a radical.
The son, full of possibilities.

58:34.591 --> 58:39.905
Don't move.
Stay where you are. "Ginevra de Benci"!

58:40.122 --> 58:44.641
Did you know you were a Leonardo,
smiling at things beyond our ken?

58:44.854 --> 58:47.701
What's this about Sir Harry's new tenants?

58:47.915 --> 58:51.355
I have found him tenants for his Cissie Villa.

58:51.569 --> 58:54.724
I've won a great victory for the comic muse.

58:54.943 --> 58:58.834
After all the trouble I took over the Miss Alans.

58:59.049 --> 59:01.551
Of course I'd prefer friends of yours...

59:01.763 --> 59:04.717
Friends of mine? The joke is to come.

59:04.928 --> 59:08.534
They're strangers
I met in the National Gallery.

59:08.756 --> 59:12.718
They had been to Italy.
A father and son. The oddest couple.

59:12.931 --> 59:17.973
In the course of conversazione,
they said they wanted a country cottage.

59:18.184 --> 59:21.968
A simple burrow
where they could smell the earth.

59:22.185 --> 59:25.483
Of course, London has its own character,

59:25.699 --> 59:30.218
but we've a longing for green things growing,
don't we, George?

59:30.431 --> 59:33.693
The sweetness of the English countryside...

59:33.911 --> 59:38.252
of wet hedgerows
with birds singing inside them.

59:38.468 --> 59:42.015
I know we should make
our heaven and earth where we are.

59:42.225 --> 59:47.196
However, I fear I've faltered
and need some help from outside.

59:47.410 --> 59:54.053
Well, in short, sir, what I seek is a country
cottage where George can come at weekends.

59:54.437 --> 01:00:01.354
I happen to know of just the place.
Not exactly a cottage, more... a villa.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:03.622
Dear sir, I implore you...

01:00:04.388 --> 01:00:06.440
If you'd give me your card...

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:11.477
I fear we have no card,
but George will write down the address.

01:00:11.694 --> 01:00:16.974
Sir Harry Otway. It is in Surrey,
a place called Summer Street.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.290
Summer Street! I've dreamed of Summer Street.

01:00:22.271 --> 01:00:25.046
It will teach that snob Sir Harry a lesson.

01:00:25.263 --> 01:00:31.064
The classes should mix, there should be
intermarriage. I believe in democracy.

01:00:31.282 --> 01:00:35.030
No, you don't!
You don't know what the word means.

01:00:35.248 --> 01:00:37.917
It isn't fair! I've probably met them before.

01:00:38.136 --> 01:00:40.769
Perfectly fair if it punishes a snob.

01:00:40.989 --> 01:00:46.684
I blame you. You had no business
to undo my work about the Miss Alans.

01:00:46.904 --> 01:00:50.509
You've scored off Sir Harry, but at my expense.

01:00:51.253 --> 01:00:53.305
It was most disloyal of you.

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:59.704
Temper, Lucy, temper. Please!

01:01:10.771 --> 01:01:13.345
- Hello?
- Hello.

01:01:13.554 --> 01:01:16.330
- I've brought someone to see you.
- One minute.

01:01:19.887 --> 01:01:22.069
Byron. Exactly.

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:28.201
"A Shropshire Lad".

01:01:30.811 --> 01:01:32.863
Never heard of it.

01:01:33.386 --> 01:01:36.232
"The Way of All Flesh".

01:01:37.212 --> 01:01:39.264
Never heard of it.

01:01:39.891 --> 01:01:42.987
Hello? George reads German.

01:01:47.441 --> 01:01:52.862
I'm certain that's old Emerson.
What are those people doing? Hello!

01:01:53.425 --> 01:01:55.822
Wait on, Mr. Beebe.

01:01:56.035 --> 01:01:58.953
- This is Mr. Honeychurch.
- How do you do?

01:01:59.167 --> 01:02:01.836
How do you do? Come in.

01:02:02.506 --> 01:02:04.653
Come and have a bathe!

01:02:04.872 --> 01:02:07.161
I'd like that.

01:02:07.377 --> 01:02:12.134
What a conversational opening!
"How do you do? Come and have a bathe."

01:02:12.353 --> 01:02:16.315
Emerson, this is Honeychurch.
You remember his sister.

01:02:16.528 --> 01:02:20.003
Oh, yes. How do you do? Glad to see you.

01:02:20.215 --> 01:02:25.980
Very glad to hear your sister is marrying.
I'm sure she'll be... happy.

01:02:26.199 --> 01:02:30.505
We know Mr. Vyse, too.
He's been very... kind.

01:02:30.722 --> 01:02:35.870
Go and bathe. It will do you good.
Then all come back for some tea.

01:02:36.081 --> 01:02:39.201
- Do you really want this bathe?
- Yes, I've said so.

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.632
Bye, Emerson.

01:02:53.511 --> 01:02:59.039
Bring some milk and honey
and... er, cakes. Cakes!

01:02:59.252 --> 01:03:03.285
Yours is glorious country, Honeychurch!

01:03:04.575 --> 01:03:08.881
As a matter of fact,
coincidence is much rarer than we suppose.

01:03:09.098 --> 01:03:14.934
For example, on reflection,
it's not coincidental that you're here now.

01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:18.591
I have reflected. It's fate. Everything is fate.

01:03:18.805 --> 01:03:22.209
You've not reflected.
Let me cross-examine you.

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:25.519
Where did you meet Mr. Vyse?

01:03:25.728 --> 01:03:29.999
- The National Gallery.
- Looking at Italian art.

01:03:30.216 --> 01:03:33.277
You see? You talk of coincidence and fate.

01:03:33.487 --> 01:03:38.837
You're naturally drawn to things Italian,
as are we and all our friends.

01:03:39.053 --> 01:03:42.007
That narrows the field immeasurably.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:46.348
It is fate, but call it Italy
if it pleases you, Vicar.

01:04:08.975 --> 01:04:12.309
Are you bathing, Mr. Beebe?

01:04:12.523 --> 01:04:15.714
- Don't be shy!
- Why not?

01:04:15.933 --> 01:04:19.516
Oh, it's wonderful! Simply ripping.

01:04:22.334 --> 01:04:24.386
Hurry up, Emerson!

01:04:26.092 --> 01:04:29.912
- Come along, Mr. Beebe!
- I may as well wash, too.

01:04:42.166 --> 01:04:44.383
Here goes.

01:05:28.473 --> 01:05:30.526
Race you round it!

01:05:39.816 --> 01:05:46.495
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
a stately pleasure dome decree..."

01:06:11.894 --> 01:06:14.990
You've gone too far! Really, I...

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:18.913
I have a boot!

01:06:22.262 --> 01:06:25.108
And some trousers...

01:06:41.815 --> 01:06:43.475
Graces alive!

01:06:48.147 --> 01:06:53.912
- Come this way immediately!
- Who were those unfortunate people?

01:06:54.131 --> 01:06:57.536
This way, Mrs. Honeychurch. Follow me.

01:07:02.517 --> 01:07:05.150
Oh, dears. Look away!

01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:09.885
Poor Mr. Beebe, too!

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.283
You're treading on me!

01:07:12.502 --> 01:07:18.374
It is you! Why not have a comfortable bath
at home with hot and cold laid on?

01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:23.146
- Mother!
- You're in no position to argue. Come, Lucy.

01:07:23.356 --> 01:07:28.078
Oh, look! No, don't look! Poor Mr. Beebe!

01:07:34.212 --> 01:07:36.264
Poor Charlotte.

01:07:37.969 --> 01:07:40.021
Poor, poor Charlotte!

01:07:40.231 --> 01:07:43.979
Standard reaction to any letter
from Cousin Charlotte.

01:07:44.197 --> 01:07:46.415
Poor, poor Charlotte!

01:07:46.632 --> 01:07:49.205
This is serious.

01:07:49.416 --> 01:07:54.766
Her boiler is to be had out and the cistern
cleaned and all kinds of to-doing.

01:07:54.982 --> 01:08:01.720
I think we should ask her to stay.
Give her a holiday while the plumbers finish.

01:08:01.941 --> 01:08:06.460
No! We're squeezed to death
with Freddy's friend and Minnie Beebe.

01:08:07.473 --> 01:08:09.619
Freddy, must you?

01:08:09.838 --> 01:08:13.278
The truth is, you don't like Charlotte.

01:08:13.492 --> 01:08:16.587
Well, she gets on my nerves.

01:08:16.796 --> 01:08:20.510
The time she met Cecil,
she drove him quite frantic.

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:27.466
So, please, don't worry us this last summer.
Spoil us by not asking her to come.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:31.292
Hear, hear. We vote no Miss Bartlett.

01:08:33.566 --> 01:08:39.724
This isn't very kind of you two.
You have each other and poor Charlotte...

01:08:39.933 --> 01:08:46.398
- Again! Poor Charlotte.
...has the water turned off and plumbers.

01:08:49.884 --> 01:08:54.367
Strike the concertina's melancholy string

01:08:54.581 --> 01:08:58.923
Blow the spirit-stirring harp like anything

01:09:03.523 --> 01:09:06.368
Let the piano's martial blast

01:09:06.584 --> 01:09:08.837
Rouse the echoes of the past

01:09:15.178 --> 01:09:18.511
They played their next sonata, let me see

01:09:18.725 --> 01:09:22.237
Medulla oblongata, key of G...

01:09:22.484 --> 01:09:24.880
However, we're in E flat.

01:09:27.946 --> 01:09:31.658
- Wasn't it any good?
- It's lovely, dear.

01:09:32.852 --> 01:09:34.441
Then they began to sing

01:09:34.661 --> 01:09:37.163
That extremely lovely thing

01:09:37.375 --> 01:09:40.636
Scherzando ma non troppo, P, P, P

01:09:40.854 --> 01:09:44.459
Scherzando ma non troppo, P, P, P

01:09:55.328 --> 01:09:58.423
Is anything the matter with Cecil?

01:09:59.885 --> 01:10:04.263
Because otherwise, I cannot account for him.

01:10:04.477 --> 01:10:07.075
Whenever I speak, he winces.

01:10:07.296 --> 01:10:10.487
I see him, Lucy. It's useless to contradict me.

01:10:10.948 --> 01:10:18.209
No doubt, I am not artistic
nor literary nor intellectual.

01:10:18.429 --> 01:10:24.622
Your father bought the drawing room
furniture, and we must put up with it.

01:10:24.831 --> 01:10:27.571
Cecil doesn't mean to be uncivil.

01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:33.553
He explained. It's ugly things
that upset him. He's not uncivil to people.

01:10:33.772 --> 01:10:37.106
Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?

01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:42.600
You can't expect a really musical person
to appreciate comic songs as we do.

01:10:42.818 --> 01:10:46.329
Must he sneer and spoil everyone's pleasure?

01:10:47.445 --> 01:10:50.992
- Go and dress, dear.
- All right, Mother.

01:11:04.528 --> 01:11:09.534
Sunday week, I want to ask
George Emerson up for some tennis.

01:11:09.747 --> 01:11:14.089
- Oh, no, Freddy...
- Oh, he's topping. He's spiffing!

01:11:14.409 --> 01:11:17.042
George Emerson is simply ripping!

01:11:33.092 --> 01:11:37.220
What a noise you're making.
Freddy, let Lucy go.

01:11:38.902 --> 01:11:40.954
Hook me behind.

01:11:51.776 --> 01:11:53.828
Need we have Charlotte?

01:11:54.037 --> 01:11:56.089
We needn't.

01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:02.101
- And now Freddy wants to ask the Emersons.
- Well, he needn't.

01:12:04.683 --> 01:12:07.779
And you're not pleased with Cecil.

01:12:09.868 --> 01:12:11.920
Kiss me.

01:12:14.877 --> 01:12:21.971
Well, of course, if you want Charlotte
to come, with her boiler and everything...

01:12:22.183 --> 01:12:24.235
She's been so kind to me.

01:12:25.593 --> 01:12:27.645
Kiss me again.

01:12:38.953 --> 01:12:42.144
- Would you like it closed?
- Oh, thank you.

01:13:04.003 --> 01:13:06.055
- Thank you so much.
- Pleasure.

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:10.578
Oh, porter! Could you...?

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.311
The ticket says Dorking.
That was the last station.

01:13:27.523 --> 01:13:31.651
How very vexing! I shall have to get a cab.

01:13:34.481 --> 01:13:36.948
Mr. Emerson. What are you doing here?

01:13:37.161 --> 01:13:41.324
My father lives here.
I've come for the weekend.

01:13:41.544 --> 01:13:44.569
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes.

01:14:27.017 --> 01:14:30.113
Oh, Lucy, I met him at the station.

01:14:30.392 --> 01:14:33.488
I had no idea. Oh, my poor Lucia!

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:43.612
My dear Marian, what a stupid blunder.
You'll never forgive me.

01:14:43.821 --> 01:14:45.102
Oh!

01:14:45.317 --> 01:14:49.351
- Freddy, pay the cab.
- No, I must. I absolutely insist.

01:14:49.562 --> 01:14:51.780
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Vyse?

01:14:51.997 --> 01:14:57.109
- And Mr. Floyd, a friend of Freddy's.
- I insist I pay for my cab.

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:01.971
- And this is Minnie, Mr. Beebe's niece.
- Grant me that.

01:15:02.192 --> 01:15:04.588
- Here you are.
- Thank you, sir.

01:15:11.029 --> 01:15:13.081
I insist, absolutely.

01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:16.516
All right.
Five shillings and a bob for the driver.

01:15:16.734 --> 01:15:21.776
We all have our foibles,
and mine is prompt settling of accounts.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.358
Does anyone have any change?

01:15:29.051 --> 01:15:32.277
How much is...?
Who do I give the sovereign to?

01:15:32.495 --> 01:15:35.128
- Toss for it, Honeychurch.
- All right.

01:15:35.348 --> 01:15:39.939
No. I know I'm a spoilsport,
but it would make me wretched.

01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:42.403
It would be robbing the one who lost.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:49.607
Freddy owes me 15 shillings, so it works out
all right if you give the pound to me.

01:15:49.822 --> 01:15:52.882
Fifteen shillings to you? How so, Mr. Vyse?

01:15:53.092 --> 01:15:57.813
Because fifteen
and five shillings make a pound.

01:15:58.032 --> 01:16:01.745
Why is Mr. Vyse taking the quid?
No, thank you!

01:16:01.964 --> 01:16:05.439
- Have some tea.
- What about Mr. Floyd's ten shi...?

01:16:05.652 --> 01:16:09.685
And why doesn't she pay the bob
for the driver?

01:16:09.896 --> 01:16:15.139
A shilling for the driver.
Of course. How kind of you to remind me.

01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:19.353
Does anyone have change for half a crown?

01:16:19.568 --> 01:16:22.201
Cecil, give that sovereign to me.

01:16:22.421 --> 01:16:26.027
Mary can change it,
and we'll start from the beginning.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:30.377
Oh, dear. I am sorry. What a nuisance I am!

01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:36.021
Poor Charlotte!

01:16:40.617 --> 01:16:43.713
Mary, have you got any change?

01:16:44.758 --> 01:16:46.810
For a sovereign.

01:16:50.638 --> 01:16:53.070
Have you told him about him?

01:16:53.282 --> 01:16:57.386
No, I haven't, nor anyone.
I promised you I shouldn't.

01:16:57.596 --> 01:17:02.152
Here's your money.
It's all shillings except two half crowns.

01:17:02.362 --> 01:17:05.102
You can settle your debt nicely now.

01:17:05.319 --> 01:17:11.227
How dreadful. How more than dreadful
if Mr. Vyse should hear from another source.

01:17:11.443 --> 01:17:14.290
There is no other source.

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:18.467
- George would tell Mr. Emerson.
- He would tell no one.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:22.570
- How do you know?
- Because I know. Shall we go out?

01:17:22.785 --> 01:17:29.629
Dear, a moment. We may not have this chance
again. Have you spoken to him yet?

01:17:29.848 --> 01:17:31.900
I have seen him.

01:17:33.919 --> 01:17:40.134
Stop thinking he admires me or any nonsense
of that sort. He doesn't. Not one straw.

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:42.823
Freddy, stop it!

01:17:43.034 --> 01:17:47.269
No, poor Minnie. No, not me. Get off!

01:18:07.319 --> 01:18:09.892
Lucy! Lucy! What's that book?

01:18:10.903 --> 01:18:14.164
Who's been leaving books out to spoil?

01:18:14.381 --> 01:18:19.067
- It's only a library book of Cecil's.
- Well, pick it up.

01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:32.674
It's a special collection.
I forget what for, but I beg,

01:18:32.890 --> 01:18:35.986
no vulgar clinking ha'pennies in the plate.

01:18:36.196 --> 01:18:39.837
Make sure Minnie has a sixpence.
Where is the child?

01:18:40.511 --> 01:18:45.517
Dear, I'm so sorry, I don't seem
to have any small change. Could you...?

01:18:45.729 --> 01:18:50.248
Yes, easily. Gracious,
how smart you look! What a lovely frock.

01:18:53.314 --> 01:18:55.496
Go on.

01:18:55.714 --> 01:18:57.968
Goodbye. Be good.

01:19:15.441 --> 01:19:20.448
"'No place on earth as glorious
as this where love is spoken face to face.

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:26.117
"So he cried, 'Utter rapture! The silvered
twilight, the wraith-like swallows,

01:19:26.332 --> 01:19:33.140
"'the perfume of the cooling earth all fill me
with inutterable and inestimable bliss.'

01:19:33.359 --> 01:19:37.879
"And so, locked in mortal combat,
they brought to life the eternal...

01:19:40.596 --> 01:19:45.673
"They brought to life the eternal battle
where men stand face to face

01:19:45.885 --> 01:19:50.440
"to slowly gird, to bravely fight,
to stoutly dare..."

01:19:51.451 --> 01:19:55.341
Listen, Lucy. Three split infinitives.

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:59.828
"And then the cry was heard,
'Once more into the breach, my friends."'

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:01.918
Victory, Mr. Floyd!

01:20:03.941 --> 01:20:10.157
"The scene is set in Florence.
The sunset. The sunset of Italy."

01:20:10.969 --> 01:20:13.923
- Did you mind losing?
- Of course.

01:20:14.135 --> 01:20:19.105
You're not such a splendid player.
The light was in my eyes.

01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:21.715
I never said I was.

01:20:21.928 --> 01:20:27.801
"Under Orcagna's Loggia -
the Loggia de Lanzi, as we call it now..."

01:20:28.017 --> 01:20:30.069
What's the title?

01:20:30.278 --> 01:20:34.347
- "Under a Loggia" by Eleanor Lavish.
- Eleanor Lavish!

01:20:34.558 --> 01:20:37.820
My goodness!
Do you remember her, Mr. Emerson?

01:20:38.037 --> 01:20:41.406
- Of course.
- No wonder the novel's so bad.

01:20:41.621 --> 01:20:44.538
Still, one ought to read it, I suppose.

01:20:44.752 --> 01:20:49.900
- There's an absurd account of a view.
- Do read it.

01:20:50.109 --> 01:20:52.505
Do you like our view, Mr. Emerson?

01:20:52.719 --> 01:20:55.709
My father says there's only one perfect view -

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:59.954
the view of the sky over our heads.

01:21:00.164 --> 01:21:03.260
I expect your father has been reading Dante.

01:21:04.687 --> 01:21:08.816
- Do read it.
- Not while Mr. Emerson is entertaining us.

01:21:09.037 --> 01:21:13.723
No, do. Nothing's funnier
than silly things read aloud.

01:21:13.943 --> 01:21:18.320
Mr. Emerson finds us frivolous.
Look for tennis balls, Mr. Emerson.

01:21:18.535 --> 01:21:21.690
- Do I have to?
- No, of course not.

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:25.006
It's in chapter two. Find me chapter two.

01:21:35.165 --> 01:21:38.285
- Give it here.
- No, it's the silliest thing.

01:21:38.505 --> 01:21:39.857
Come on.

01:21:40.071 --> 01:21:42.396
- Cecil!
- Thank you.

01:21:43.793 --> 01:21:45.667
A-ha.

01:21:45.881 --> 01:21:48.835
"Afar off, the towers of Florence.

01:21:49.048 --> 01:21:53.947
"And she wandered as though in a dream
through the wavering sea of barley,

01:21:54.161 --> 01:21:57.151
"touched with crimson stains of poppies.

01:21:58.684 --> 01:22:02.362
"All unobserved, he came to her."
Isn't it immortal?

01:22:02.581 --> 01:22:08.524
"There came from his lips no wordy
protestations such as formal lovers use.

01:22:08.739 --> 01:22:15.548
"No eloquence was his, nor did he need it.
He simply enfolded her in his manly arms..."

01:22:15.767 --> 01:22:18.341
No, this isn't the bit. It's further on.

01:22:18.586 --> 01:22:22.191
- Shall we go in to tea?
- By all means.

01:22:46.767 --> 01:22:48.819
Excuse me.

01:22:56.856 --> 01:22:58.908
Charlotte, a minute.

01:23:00.023 --> 01:23:04.436
Cecil, ask Mary for sandwiches.
I'll be with you in a moment.

01:23:06.494 --> 01:23:09.376
Do you know Miss Lavish's novel?

01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:15.805
There's a scene in it - the hero and heroine
make love. Do you know about that?

01:23:16.757 --> 01:23:18.975
Do you know about it?

01:23:19.193 --> 01:23:23.013
They're on a hillside
and Florence is in the distance.

01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:25.802
There are poppies and a barley field.

01:23:27.334 --> 01:23:30.880
It can't be coincidence.
How could you tell her?!

01:23:31.092 --> 01:23:36.263
Oh, Lucy! Oh, dearest girl!
She hasn't put that in her novel?

01:23:40.381 --> 01:23:45.173
Never, never more
shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.

01:23:45.391 --> 01:23:49.626
So you did tell. Why?!
When you wouldn't even let me tell Mother?

01:23:54.403 --> 01:23:56.656
Cecil read it to me.

01:23:56.907 --> 01:24:00.656
And that man insulted me again
behind Cecil's back.

01:24:01.987 --> 01:24:06.329
Why did you tell her? What made you?!

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:12.901
Even if you forgive me, I shall never
forgive myself... till my dying day.

01:24:18.652 --> 01:24:21.013
Go and call him.

01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:25.111
- Call Mr. Vyse?
- No. The other one.

01:24:27.176 --> 01:24:29.050
I'll deal with him myself.

01:24:38.379 --> 01:24:41.296
You missed a good match, Miss Bartlett.

01:24:56.888 --> 01:24:59.984
Charlotte, please stay.

01:25:00.194 --> 01:25:04.879
Mr. Emerson, leave this house
and don't come back as long as I'm here.

01:25:05.099 --> 01:25:07.982
- I can't.
- No discussion.

01:25:09.274 --> 01:25:12.501
Go, please.
I don't want to call in Mr. Vyse.

01:25:14.423 --> 01:25:16.475
You mean to marry that man?

01:25:16.685 --> 01:25:23.743
- You're being ridiculous.
- I'd have held back if Cecil was different.

01:25:23.956 --> 01:25:28.713
But he's the sort who can't know
anyone intimately, least of all a woman.

01:25:28.932 --> 01:25:32.301
He doesn't know what a woman is.

01:25:32.516 --> 01:25:38.281
He wants you for a possession,
to look at like a painting or an ivory box.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.346
Something to own and to display.

01:25:41.561 --> 01:25:47.089
He doesn't want you to be real,
to think and to live. He doesn't love you.

01:25:47.302 --> 01:25:51.573
But I love you. I want you
to have your own thoughts and ideas,

01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:54.363
even when I hold you in my arms.

01:25:54.539 --> 01:25:59.438
Miss Bartlett, you wouldn't stop us,
not if you understood.

01:25:59.653 --> 01:26:01.705
It's our last chance.

01:26:04.141 --> 01:26:08.969
Do you understand how lucky people are
to find what's right for them?

01:26:09.186 --> 01:26:11.582
It's such a blessing, don't you see?

01:26:11.796 --> 01:26:18.083
And the fact I love Cecil and shall be
his wife shortly is of no importance?

01:26:18.301 --> 01:26:22.607
This tremendous thing has happened
between us and it means...

01:26:22.824 --> 01:26:25.706
it means nothing must hinder us ever again.

01:26:26.443 --> 01:26:29.254
You have to understand that.

01:26:30.339 --> 01:26:34.716
- I've no idea what you mean.
- Everyone must understand.

01:26:34.931 --> 01:26:37.114
And you must leave.

01:26:38.481 --> 01:26:41.707
It was wrong of me to listen to you.

01:26:41.925 --> 01:26:46.373
But you haven't been listening.
If you had, you would know!

01:26:46.587 --> 01:26:48.639
- Leave at once. Now.
- Lucy...

01:26:48.848 --> 01:26:53.676
- No, I will not listen to one more word.
- My dears, do stop.

01:26:53.893 --> 01:26:58.021
Haven't you done enough?
Don't interfere again.

01:26:58.242 --> 01:27:03.449
- It's useless. Let me go, Miss Bartlett.
- Let Mr. Emerson go, Charlotte.

01:27:11.498 --> 01:27:14.938
- I shall never forgive myself.
- You always say that,

01:27:15.151 --> 01:27:17.653
but you always do forgive yourself.

01:27:25.484 --> 01:27:30.276
Why does Italy make lady novelists
reach such summits of absurdity?

01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:34.110
Lucy, it's still light enough for another set.

01:27:34.878 --> 01:27:37.998
- Mr. Emerson has had to go.
- What a nuisance.

01:27:39.088 --> 01:27:45.103
I say, Cecil, do play, there's a good chap.
Just this once. It's Floyd's last day.

01:27:46.568 --> 01:27:52.725
Freddy, as you remarked this morning,
some chaps are good for nothing but books.

01:27:52.936 --> 01:27:55.640
I plead guilty to being such a chap.

01:28:09.357 --> 01:28:11.955
Because I wouldn't play tennis?

01:28:15.271 --> 01:28:18.640
I never do play tennis. I never could.

01:28:18.855 --> 01:28:21.525
Forget tennis. It was just the last straw.

01:28:22.752 --> 01:28:27.307
I'm sorry, I can't marry you.
One day you'll be glad I said so.

01:28:27.518 --> 01:28:30.923
- We're too different.
- But I...

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.502
I love you.

01:28:36.147 --> 01:28:40.109
And... I did think you loved me.

01:28:40.322 --> 01:28:42.374
I did not.

01:28:44.114 --> 01:28:48.348
I thought I did at first. I'm sorry.

01:28:51.107 --> 01:28:54.785
As for your loving me, you don't, not really.

01:28:56.639 --> 01:28:59.759
You don't. It's only as something else.

01:28:59.979 --> 01:29:05.400
As something you own. A painting, a Leonardo.

01:29:05.616 --> 01:29:09.221
I don't want to be a Leonardo,
I want to be myself.

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:13.473
Oh, let's not go on now.

01:29:13.687 --> 01:29:17.471
I'll only say things
that will make me unhappy afterwards.

01:29:35.397 --> 01:29:39.074
You don't love me, evidently.

01:29:39.293 --> 01:29:41.440
I dare say you're right not to...

01:29:43.399 --> 01:29:47.741
...but it would help a little,
hurt a little less, if I knew why.

01:29:49.731 --> 01:29:51.783
Because...

01:29:53.593 --> 01:29:57.792
...you can't know anyone intimately,
least of all a woman.

01:29:58.012 --> 01:30:02.912
I don't mean exactly that,
but you will go on asking questions.

01:30:04.239 --> 01:30:07.465
You wrap yourself up in art,
and want to wrap me up,

01:30:07.684 --> 01:30:09.736
so I'm breaking it off.

01:30:11.477 --> 01:30:13.529
It's true.

01:30:14.816 --> 01:30:16.868
True, on the whole.

01:30:18.435 --> 01:30:24.200
You're so different tonight, like a different
person speaking with a new voice.

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:30.255
What do you mean? If you think
I love someone else, you're mistaken.

01:30:30.473 --> 01:30:32.940
Of course I don't. I only meant that...

01:30:33.151 --> 01:30:38.193
there was a... force in you
I hadn't known of up to now.

01:30:40.249 --> 01:30:45.778
If a girl breaks off her engagement,
everyone thinks, "Oh, she has someone else."

01:30:46.686 --> 01:30:49.082
It's disgusting, brutal!

01:30:50.304 --> 01:30:54.823
Forgive me if I say stupid things.
My brain has gone to pieces.

01:30:55.036 --> 01:30:59.164
I think we'd better go to bed, if you don't mind.

01:31:07.213 --> 01:31:09.431
Let me do that for you.

01:31:14.867 --> 01:31:18.995
I must actually thank you for what you've done.

01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:25.025
For showing me what I really am.

01:31:36.576 --> 01:31:38.629
I admire your courage.

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:45.757
Will you shake hands?

01:31:45.970 --> 01:31:48.117
Of course I will, Cecil.

01:31:49.902 --> 01:31:51.255
Goodnight.

01:31:51.467 --> 01:31:53.721
I'm sorry about it.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.096
Thank you for taking it so well.

01:32:32.174 --> 01:32:37.074
Since the days are chillier now
and we've not, alas, a home of our own,

01:32:37.288 --> 01:32:41.701
my sister feels we might benefit
by travel to a warmer clime.

01:32:41.916 --> 01:32:47.444
The doctor has ordered her special bread,
but we can take that with us.

01:32:47.657 --> 01:32:52.105
It is only getting first into a steamer
and then a train.

01:32:55.972 --> 01:32:59.827
- Hello. So you're off, Mr. Vyse?
- Yes.

01:33:00.043 --> 01:33:06.959
I've come to show Miss Honeychurch
a letter from our friends the Miss Alans.

01:33:07.175 --> 01:33:14.400
"Since Florence did my sister so much good,
we think we should try Athens this winter."

01:33:14.621 --> 01:33:19.793
Isn't it wonderful?
The Parthenon, the frieze of Phydias.

01:33:20.014 --> 01:33:23.003
- Have you ever met these Miss Alans?
- Never.

01:33:23.214 --> 01:33:27.176
Then you cannot appreciate
the romance of this visit.

01:33:27.389 --> 01:33:30.615
I've never been myself,
nor do I have any plans to go.

01:33:30.834 --> 01:33:36.290
Altogether too big for our little lot,
don't you agree? Got any matches?

01:33:36.504 --> 01:33:38.616
Thank you.

01:33:38.836 --> 01:33:42.999
You're quite right.
Greece is not for our little lot.

01:33:43.219 --> 01:33:44.879
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:33:53.935 --> 01:33:56.532
Mr. Beebe! Matches!

01:33:58.006 --> 01:34:00.058
Matches!

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:04.370
Cecil's hard hit. Lucy won't marry him.

01:34:04.581 --> 01:34:07.677
- When?
- Late last night. I must go.

01:34:07.887 --> 01:34:10.912
- Will they want me to go down?
- Yes. Goodbye.

01:34:16.549 --> 01:34:18.602
All right, Powell.

01:34:26.778 --> 01:34:31.298
No, Charlotte.
Not the scissors, not when my hands are full.

01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:34.500
- Good afternoon.
- How do you do, Mr. Beebe?

01:34:34.711 --> 01:34:37.973
- Good gracious! What a mess things are!
- Yes.

01:34:38.190 --> 01:34:42.840
Everyone's so horrid today, Uncle Arthur.
Let's go out to tea.

01:34:43.061 --> 01:34:47.688
Good idea. Get your hat and coat
and I'll take you.

01:34:47.898 --> 01:34:52.797
I'll take Minnie to the Beehive Tavern.
Care to join us, Miss Bartlett?

01:34:53.012 --> 01:34:55.609
Oh, yes, Charlotte! I don't mind.

01:34:55.829 --> 01:35:00.136
No. You have no one to help.
My services are better than nothing.

01:35:02.614 --> 01:35:05.841
Oh, dear, Marian. I'm so sorry.

01:35:17.087 --> 01:35:23.589
A delightful letter from the Miss Alans.
They're going to Greece. I'll read you some.

01:35:28.464 --> 01:35:33.399
"Dear Mr. Beebe, I doubt we shall go
any further than Athens,

01:35:33.614 --> 01:35:39.866
"but, if you know of a good pensione
in Constantinople, we should be so grateful."

01:35:41.094 --> 01:35:46.823
Isn't that delightful? I do believe
they'll end by going round the world.

01:35:47.043 --> 01:35:48.502
Delightful.

01:35:51.392 --> 01:35:55.521
Miss Honeychurch, your brother has told me.

01:35:57.864 --> 01:36:01.469
- Did he?
- I needn't say it will go no further.

01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:08.951
Mother... Charlotte... Cecil... Freddy... you...

01:36:10.841 --> 01:36:14.945
If I may say so,
I'm certain you've done the right thing.

01:36:15.155 --> 01:36:19.318
Tell me more of the Miss Alans.
How splendid of them to go abroad.

01:36:19.539 --> 01:36:26.041
I want them to start from Venice and then
go by cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:31.047
- Did Freddy say he'd drive straight back?
- No, he didn't.

01:36:31.264 --> 01:36:33.375
I hope he won't gossip.

01:36:33.595 --> 01:36:37.379
How splendid of them to go.
I wish they'd take me.

01:36:37.596 --> 01:36:39.648
Would your mother spare you?

01:36:39.858 --> 01:36:42.633
She must. I simply must go away.

01:36:42.849 --> 01:36:45.803
I have to. Don't you see I have to go away?

01:36:46.016 --> 01:36:49.657
Charlotte, the Miss Alans
are going to Constantinople.

01:36:49.877 --> 01:36:51.929
No, only to Athens.

01:36:52.279 --> 01:36:55.754
I've longed to go to Constantinople...
Athens, I mean.

01:36:55.966 --> 01:37:00.972
In lieu of Constantinople,
could not we lure you to tea at the Beehive?

01:37:01.184 --> 01:37:06.605
- No, thank you.
- Oh, well, Minnie, you and I must eat alone.

01:37:06.821 --> 01:37:10.012
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.

01:37:16.563 --> 01:37:19.137
- You must persuade Mother.
- What?

01:37:19.346 --> 01:37:23.474
Don't you see? I must go somewhere. Anywhere!

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.411
I must get away, far, before it's known.

01:37:27.627 --> 01:37:31.031
- What?
- That I've broken off my engagement.

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:35.551
- He mustn't get any ideas.
- You mean Mr. Emerson?

01:37:35.768 --> 01:37:37.915
Charlotte, how slow you are.

01:37:38.134 --> 01:37:42.725
There must be no gossip
at Summer Street, but to go as far as Greece!

01:37:42.935 --> 01:37:48.913
I thought you'd be the first to go to Mother
and say Lucy must go to Greece.

01:37:49.128 --> 01:37:53.719
Lucy, are you absolutely sure?
I only want to do what is right for you.

01:37:53.929 --> 01:37:57.748
I'm telling you what's right.
Don't argue, do it!

01:37:57.965 --> 01:38:00.017
All right.

01:38:01.932 --> 01:38:03.984
Thank you, Freddy.

01:38:06.732 --> 01:38:08.950
Why does she look like that?

01:38:09.168 --> 01:38:13.166
- Like what?
- Like Charlotte Bartlett.

01:38:13.378 --> 01:38:17.506
Because... she is Charlotte Bartlett.

01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:27.214
Stop thine ear against the singer

01:38:28.443 --> 01:38:36.747
From the red gold, keep thy finger

01:38:36.967 --> 01:38:39.884
The tune's fine, but the words are rotten.

01:38:42.847 --> 01:38:44.899
- Marian?
- Oh, Charlotte!

01:38:45.108 --> 01:38:49.379
- Lucy has a plan.
- Isn't this a tragedy?

01:38:49.596 --> 01:38:53.202
I get one thing tied up
and another thing falls over.

01:38:53.423 --> 01:38:57.979
- The Misses Alan are going to Greece.
- Good luck to them.

01:38:58.190 --> 01:39:01.773
Lucy would like to join them
as far as Athens.

01:39:01.983 --> 01:39:07.439
- She'd what?!
- And on to Delphi if the roads are safe.

01:39:08.488 --> 01:39:13.245
Vacant heart and hand and eye

01:39:13.464 --> 01:39:18.327
Easy live and quiet die

01:39:18.543 --> 01:39:23.027
Vacant heart and hand and eye

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:29.361
Easy live and quiet die

01:39:42.619 --> 01:39:48.254
You can take all those, but leave me Thoreau
till I go. I need him by me now.

01:39:50.273 --> 01:39:53.428
It's an ugly house. We never liked it.

01:39:58.484 --> 01:40:02.517
I mustn't miss the train.
The removers can do the rest.

01:40:02.729 --> 01:40:04.009
Oh, I...

01:40:04.225 --> 01:40:08.080
No. I don't want you straining your back.

01:40:09.339 --> 01:40:13.407
I won't be down at the weekend.
There's no point.

01:40:14.489 --> 01:40:18.617
I'll come to take you back to town
the week after.

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:53.726
Paper soap is a great help towards
freshening up one's face on a train.

01:40:53.942 --> 01:40:59.506
But you know about these matters,
and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.

01:40:59.717 --> 01:41:01.900
A gentleman is such a standby.

01:41:02.119 --> 01:41:05.345
It's so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you.

01:41:06.015 --> 01:41:08.589
Perhaps he will join you later.

01:41:08.798 --> 01:41:13.734
- Or does work keep him in London?
- We shall meet him when he sees you off.

01:41:13.947 --> 01:41:16.972
No one will see Lucy off. She doesn't like it.

01:41:17.183 --> 01:41:19.235
Really?

01:41:20.141 --> 01:41:22.217
But, in this case...

01:41:22.437 --> 01:41:26.506
- You aren't going?
- Yes, we've a train to catch.

01:41:26.716 --> 01:41:31.165
- It's been such a pleasure to meet you.
- We will write you often

01:41:31.378 --> 01:41:35.482
and send pretty cards from every place.

01:41:35.692 --> 01:41:41.565
- Thank you so much for taking her.
- Bye-bye.

01:41:42.024 --> 01:41:44.076
Well, we got through that time.

01:41:44.286 --> 01:41:48.248
Yes, and were seen through,
which is most unpleasant.

01:41:49.539 --> 01:41:53.466
I cannot understand
this hole and corner business.

01:41:53.714 --> 01:41:56.810
You got rid of Cecil, well and good.

01:41:57.925 --> 01:42:00.914
I'm thankful. Why not announce it?

01:42:01.126 --> 01:42:05.397
- I promised. It's only for a few days.
- Victoria Station.

01:42:05.614 --> 01:42:11.070
I couldn't help thinking
that our dear Lucy did not... No.

01:42:11.285 --> 01:42:16.362
I wish you'd finish your sentences.
You're getting worse.

01:42:17.373 --> 01:42:20.813
...did not look like a bride-to-be.

01:42:21.687 --> 01:42:27.037
How should one look? According
to your great experience in these matters.

01:42:27.254 --> 01:42:31.358
I can't say exactly.
Only... she lacked something.

01:42:31.568 --> 01:42:37.476
And, if you want to know,
Teresa, she lacked... radiance.

01:42:53.557 --> 01:42:55.609
- Miss Bartlett.
- Mr. Beebe.

01:42:55.818 --> 01:42:59.602
- What is happening to your neighbors?
- They're moving.

01:42:59.819 --> 01:43:04.470
Old Mr. Emerson's rheumatism is back,
and George thinks it's too far.

01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:07.501
Mr. Emerson is avoiding the removers inside.

01:43:07.717 --> 01:43:11.394
Might I impose
and wait here for Mrs. Honeychurch?

01:43:11.613 --> 01:43:15.955
By all means. I'm afraid you must excuse me.

01:43:18.328 --> 01:43:21.626
Mr. Emerson, Miss Bartlett, excuse me.

01:43:22.155 --> 01:43:23.507
Oh, please.

01:43:23.721 --> 01:43:27.304
I am sorry that the house
has brought on your rheumatism.

01:43:27.514 --> 01:43:31.926
It's not the rheumatism, it's my boy.

01:43:32.141 --> 01:43:34.537
George is so sorry.

01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:39.234
I cannot blame him,
but I wish he'd told me about it first.

01:43:39.447 --> 01:43:43.646
- He never told you what happened in Italy?
- Not a word.

01:43:45.223 --> 01:43:48.105
No. Lucy said he wouldn't.

01:43:48.319 --> 01:43:50.371
I was only told last Sunday.

01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:53.534
- What were you told?
- That he loves her.

01:43:56.913 --> 01:43:59.166
Won't you sit down?

01:43:59.383 --> 01:44:01.530
I think I hear the carriage.

01:44:01.749 --> 01:44:04.631
It would be discourteous
to keep my cousin waiting.

01:44:04.845 --> 01:44:07.063
There isn't any carriage.

01:44:08.186 --> 01:44:10.439
Sit down, my dear.

01:44:18.866 --> 01:44:23.243
Everyone's been lying, except George.

01:44:23.459 --> 01:44:28.015
And now here's Miss Honeychurch
marrying Mr. Vyse in January...

01:44:28.225 --> 01:44:30.858
She has broken off her engagement.

01:44:31.078 --> 01:44:35.800
It was all done
with great tact and discretion, naturally.

01:44:36.019 --> 01:44:39.732
And, for the time being,
we would like to keep it quiet.

01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:45.679
There's a time for keeping quiet
and there's a time for speaking out.

01:44:47.152 --> 01:44:50.177
Now, you don't hear any carriage.

01:44:50.387 --> 01:44:55.109
Why don't you sit back,
make yourself more comfortable? Take this.

01:44:55.328 --> 01:44:57.997
There. You look much better.

01:44:58.633 --> 01:45:02.761
So... she's not marrying Mr. Vyse?

01:45:05.314 --> 01:45:08.268
Why? Why Greece?

01:45:09.175 --> 01:45:12.994
Why rush off to the ends of the earth?

01:45:13.211 --> 01:45:18.111
You're tired of your home.
You're tired of Windy Corner.

01:45:18.326 --> 01:45:20.923
And you're tired of Freddy and me.

01:45:22.014 --> 01:45:27.922
Of course I'm not tired of Windy Corner,
but, as we're talking about it,

01:45:28.137 --> 01:45:31.435
I shall want to come up to London more.

01:45:31.651 --> 01:45:36.407
I might even share a flat
for a little with some other girl.

01:45:36.626 --> 01:45:39.508
You see, I come into my money next year.

01:45:40.766 --> 01:45:45.037
To mess about with typewriters
and latchkeys and call it work.

01:45:46.403 --> 01:45:49.249
- Perhaps I spoke hastily.
- Oh, goodness!

01:45:49.464 --> 01:45:52.240
You remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!

01:45:52.456 --> 01:45:55.125
- Charlotte?!
- Charlotte to a T.

01:45:58.997 --> 01:46:02.579
I don't know what you mean.
We are not the least alike.

01:46:03.450 --> 01:46:08.041
- You never used to be.
- Can't we have the hood down?

01:46:16.428 --> 01:46:18.646
Can we have the hood down, Powell?

01:46:29.822 --> 01:46:32.183
Powell, is that house to be let again?

01:46:32.397 --> 01:46:35.766
Sir Harry's looking
for new tenants, I hear, Miss.

01:46:35.981 --> 01:46:38.483
What a pity about the Emersons.

01:46:38.695 --> 01:46:42.858
Freddy will be so sorry.
And, indeed, so am I.

01:46:43.078 --> 01:46:47.242
- All right, Powell, stop at the stores.
- Yes, ma'am. Walk on.

01:46:48.367 --> 01:46:51.878
Such an agreeable family.
What a pity.

01:47:06.598 --> 01:47:08.959
No Charlotte.

01:47:09.172 --> 01:47:11.498
Go and see if she's at Mr. Beebe's.

01:47:11.712 --> 01:47:16.718
And do hurry, both of you.
Mary has her fish pie in.

01:47:18.532 --> 01:47:21.936
Did you hear what I said, Lucy?

01:47:32.552 --> 01:47:34.248
Lucy!

01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:40.513
Mr. Emerson says it's all his fault.

01:47:40.729 --> 01:47:42.781
I told him to trust to love.

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:48.938
I told him, "George, love and do
what you will." It's what I taught him.

01:47:49.913 --> 01:47:53.068
So you see, it is all my fault.

01:47:53.288 --> 01:47:55.340
Where are you going?

01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:59.548
Your mother offered
to fetch me in her carriage.

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:04.967
I have not been brought up to keep
anyone waiting, least of all a kind hostess.

01:48:08.179 --> 01:48:10.231
And now where's Lucy?

01:48:11.171 --> 01:48:16.177
Get in. If Mary's fish pie spoils,
she'll mope till next Friday.

01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:18.442
- I will sit here.
- Nonsense.

01:48:18.651 --> 01:48:23.408
- I mustn't inconvenience you.
- You know you prefer facing.

01:48:23.627 --> 01:48:29.297
I've no wish to even hear your son's name
mentioned. He has misbehaved from the first.

01:48:32.116 --> 01:48:34.892
In fact, he behaved abominably.

01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:39.415
Not abominably. He only tried
when he should not have tried.

01:48:42.484 --> 01:48:46.339
No, of course,
abominable is too strong a word.

01:48:48.850 --> 01:48:52.919
- It's no good discussing this.
- George is taking me to London.

01:48:54.243 --> 01:48:58.407
He can't bear to be here,
and I must be where he is.

01:48:58.732 --> 01:49:04.605
He says the thought of...
seeing you or hearing about you...

01:49:04.821 --> 01:49:08.783
Mr. Emerson, please don't go on my account.
I'm going to Greece.

01:49:09.865 --> 01:49:13.376
Don't leave your comfortable house.
You mustn't!

01:49:13.588 --> 01:49:15.841
Why are you going to Greece?

01:49:17.554 --> 01:49:21.100
Forgive me, but it seems to me
you're in a muddle.

01:49:21.312 --> 01:49:26.247
I think the reason you're going to Greece
and you've broken off your engagement -

01:49:26.461 --> 01:49:32.546
Miss Bartlett told me -
is that... you love George.

01:49:35.855 --> 01:49:38.951
All the light's gone out of your pretty face.

01:49:40.204 --> 01:49:42.565
Just like it's gone out of George.

01:49:42.778 --> 01:49:47.642
I can't bear it,
and now I've made you cry. Forgive me.

01:49:47.858 --> 01:49:52.543
But I've got to go to Greece now.
The ticket's bought and everything.

01:49:52.763 --> 01:49:57.591
- It's impossible!
- There's only one thing impossible.

01:49:57.808 --> 01:50:00.798
That's to love... and to part.

01:50:02.297 --> 01:50:04.349
Lucy!

01:50:06.472 --> 01:50:08.524
You love George.

01:50:09.359 --> 01:50:13.843
You love the boy
body and soul, as he loves you.

01:50:14.056 --> 01:50:16.108
But of course I do.

01:50:16.631 --> 01:50:18.683
What did you all think?

01:50:19.588 --> 01:50:23.479
- Then...
- No. Mother's calling. I've got to go.

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.372
They trust me.

01:50:26.581 --> 01:50:29.736
Why should they?
When you deceived everyone...

01:50:31.799 --> 01:50:33.852
...including yourself.

01:50:37.923 --> 01:50:41.292
Charlotte, sit here. Go on, Powell.

01:50:45.751 --> 01:50:49.678
- One week Italy, then Greece.
- Greece may be cancelled.

01:50:49.892 --> 01:50:51.968
- What?!
- Do stop!

01:50:52.188 --> 01:50:55.663
- I think Lucy has something to tell us.
- Stop the horse!

01:51:09.236 --> 01:51:13.020
Dear Charlotte, after an awful journey

01:51:13.237 --> 01:51:17.436
when our luggage went missing twice,
we reached Florence.

01:51:17.656 --> 01:51:22.140
You'll be glad to hear that
the Pensione Bertolini is its dear self.

01:51:22.352 --> 01:51:26.136
The Cockney signora still terrorizes the staff.

01:51:26.353 --> 01:51:30.481
Her guests are another set
of Miss Alans, Miss Lavish, Mr. Beebe

01:51:30.702 --> 01:51:34.973
- and Charlotte and Lucy.
- We were promised rooms with a view.

01:51:35.191 --> 01:51:41.550
Hush, we mustn't. First thing tomorrow,
I shall have a bone to pick with the signora.

01:51:41.767 --> 01:51:44.092
It's so unfair!

01:51:44.307 --> 01:51:49.313
Don't you agree that, on one's first visit to
Florence, one must have a room with a view?

01:51:49.525 --> 01:51:51.577
We have a view.

01:52:08.173 --> 01:52:10.225
Kiss me again.

01:52:10.435 --> 01:52:13.175
- Again.
- I'm reading.

01:52:14.053 --> 01:52:17.493
- What are you reading?
- It's from Freddy.

01:52:17.707 --> 01:52:19.759
What does he say?

01:52:20.907 --> 01:52:25.035
Silly boy, he thinks he's being dignified.

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:40.519
I mean, everybody knew
we were going away in the spring.

01:52:41.305 --> 01:52:47.670
