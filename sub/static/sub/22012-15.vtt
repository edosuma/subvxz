00:01.835 --> 00:04.105
ADULT ADAM:
Back in the '80s, I grew up
at the movie theater.

00:04.172 --> 00:05.606
There was nothing
I loved more
than escaping

00:05.673 --> 00:07.375
into the wonder
of the big screen.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.444
The lights, the sound,
the snacks, it was magic.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.746
What I loved
more than anything
was seeing a new movie

00:12.813 --> 00:16.717
from my all-time favorite
director, Steven Spielberg.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.719
In fact, I didn't
just want to see his movies,

00:18.786 --> 00:19.953
I wanted to live them.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.789
Stop playing
with your food, moron.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.792
I'm not playing!
It's from Close Encounters.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.894
There's your close encounter.
Now, eat!

00:26.960 --> 00:28.429
ADULT ADAM:
My favorite movie geek hobby

00:28.496 --> 00:29.930
was re-creating
all his classics.

00:29.997 --> 00:31.065
Yo.
Gahh!

00:31.132 --> 00:32.700
In this case, E.T.

00:32.766 --> 00:35.103
Then one day, I came across
something so legendary,

00:35.169 --> 00:38.239
it would take my Spielberg
obsession to the next level.

00:38.306 --> 00:41.409
Psst. Nerd.
Girl nerd.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.476
I got your hookup.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.911
Really? Let me see it.

00:43.977 --> 00:46.414
What the hell's happening?
Shh! Be cool.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.449
Johnny's
my bootleg VHS dealer.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.318
You name it, I'll get it.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.821
ADULT ADAM:
Back before everything
was on YouTube,

00:53.887 --> 00:56.590
cult videos
were passed around
like contraband,

00:56.657 --> 00:59.160
and Johnny Atkins
had all the goods.

00:59.227 --> 01:02.796
And the
piece de resistance...

01:02.863 --> 01:05.466
What I saw next
would change my life forever.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.101
That year,
two kids from Jersey

01:07.168 --> 01:08.936
made a shot-for-shot
re-creation

01:09.002 --> 01:10.638
of Raiders
of the Lost Ark.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.640
Turns out, there were other
Spielberg fanatics out there,

01:12.706 --> 01:14.508
and their homemade masterpiece
made me feel

01:14.575 --> 01:16.144
like anything was possible!

01:16.210 --> 01:18.679
I thought this was
the stuff of geek legend,

01:18.746 --> 01:19.780
but it's real.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.849
Whoa, the guys
are super hot.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.819
Your lady really has a type.
I feel sad for her.

01:25.886 --> 01:29.190
Know what?
If these kids can remake
Raiders in the basement,

01:29.257 --> 01:30.791
maybe it's time
I take the leap.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.793
If my dream
is to become a Spielberg,

01:32.860 --> 01:33.927
I've got to
write and direct

01:33.994 --> 01:35.929
my own original
Indiana Jones story.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.665
If you need a butt double
for your movie,

01:37.731 --> 01:40.134
you know where to find me.

01:40.201 --> 01:43.371
ADULT ADAM:
And so, I set off to write
my first actual movie script.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.973
And to my surprise,
it was fun as hell!

01:46.039 --> 01:47.475
Whatcha doing, boofaloo?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.642
Writing a script.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.778
Yay!

01:50.844 --> 01:54.014
So, what's the name
of your big, fancy new movie?

01:54.081 --> 01:58.552
Let's see...
Indiana Jones and the

01:58.619 --> 02:00.120
Thunder

02:01.289 --> 02:02.356
Glove

02:02.423 --> 02:03.891
of the Prime

02:03.957 --> 02:05.393
Mutant!

02:05.459 --> 02:06.960
That's it!

02:07.027 --> 02:10.198
Indiana Jones and the Thunder
Glove of the Prime Mutant.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.599
It writes itself!

02:13.234 --> 02:15.336
You looked around the room,

02:15.403 --> 02:17.905
and you came up
with a title!

02:23.811 --> 02:25.813
It was March 7th,
1980-something,

02:25.879 --> 02:27.147
and my dad and Pops
were having

02:27.215 --> 02:28.849
the most important
Philadelphia debate...

02:28.916 --> 02:30.818
Who makes
the best cheesesteak?

02:30.884 --> 02:32.853
It's Geno's!
Come on, it's Pat's!

02:32.920 --> 02:34.588
It's Geno's!
It's Pat's!

02:34.655 --> 02:36.089
You're making a fool
of yourself.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.891
Hey! What's
all the yelling about?

02:37.958 --> 02:39.293
This old putz thinks

02:39.360 --> 02:41.429
Geno's makes a better
cheesesteak than Pat's.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.930
Guys, relax.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.899
Pat's and Geno's
sell the same exact thing

02:45.966 --> 02:47.835
right across the street
from each other.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.870
They're both fine,
but not the best.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.240
If you say Jim's Steaks,
you no longer have a home.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.608
Jim's is down the block,
Barry!

02:54.675 --> 02:57.311
It's not even
on cheesesteak row!

02:57.378 --> 02:59.913
I'm not saying
it's Jim's, Pat's, or Geno's.

02:59.980 --> 03:04.084
The best Philly cheesesteak
isn't even in Philadelphia.

03:04.151 --> 03:07.421
ADULT ADAM: In Philly,
that was blasphemy.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.557
What are you saying?
What's he saying, Murray?

03:09.623 --> 03:10.624
I don't know.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.059
It was early December.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.462
I was on my way to watch
the Flyers play the Devils

03:14.528 --> 03:15.629
in New Jersey.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.997
Stop!

03:17.064 --> 03:18.966
There's no cheesesteak story
that ends in Jersey.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.067
But there is.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.803
I took the wrong off-ramp
and got lost.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.873
As night fell,
I grew desperate and hungry.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.909
And then,
like a cheesy beacon of hope,

03:28.976 --> 03:32.480
I saw a lone sandwich shop
glowing in the darkness.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.215
Stop. just tell us the name
of the sandwich shop already.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.417
That's the thing.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.952
I was so overwhelmed
by the flavor

03:39.019 --> 03:40.120
that I didn't get a chance

03:40.187 --> 03:41.822
to look up
from my poppy-seed kaiser roll

03:41.889 --> 03:43.324
to get a name.

03:43.391 --> 03:46.226
Poppy-seed kaiser roll
on a cheesesteak?

03:46.294 --> 03:48.061
It can't be done!

03:48.128 --> 03:49.497
Oh, they did it.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.231
It was the poppiest
of rolls,

03:51.299 --> 03:53.534
combined with
the whizziest of cheeses.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.702
It was like eating

03:54.768 --> 03:57.605
the sweet butt meat
of an angel in...

03:57.671 --> 03:59.607
Hey! I'm still talkin'!

03:59.673 --> 04:01.709
I didn't finish
my awesome true story!

04:01.775 --> 04:03.243
Well,
we know how it ends.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.446
With you being a giant moron,
you moron.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.981
No! I hate it
when you call me a moron.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.117
I only call you a moron
'cause you act like a moron.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.585
So it's on you.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.087
Then, it's my life mission
to find this Jersey oasis

04:14.154 --> 04:15.623
and take you there.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.326
And when you eat the greatest
steak sandwich of your life,

04:18.392 --> 04:19.793
I will prove you wrong,

04:19.860 --> 04:22.663
and you shall never
call me a moron again.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.533
And what happens when I hate
this imaginary sandwich?

04:25.599 --> 04:28.302
Then I'll accept
once and for all
that I'm truly a moron.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.670
No, you won't.
Oh, I will.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.505
In fact, if I'm wrong,

04:31.572 --> 04:34.174
I will legally change my name
to "Moron."

04:34.241 --> 04:35.809
Okay, I'll take that deal.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.513
My crusade for
the Hoagie Grail begins now.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.483
ADULT ADAM:
While my brother was preparing
for his cheesesteak quest,

04:42.550 --> 04:45.853
I was prepping my shot list
to bring my script to life.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.288
Look what I found
and immediately read.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.991
Oh! My Indy script?
How'd you get this?

04:51.058 --> 04:53.193
I hid it under my mattress
and sleeping body.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.528
Well, you may not know this,

04:54.595 --> 04:55.829
'cause you're
a very deep sleeper,

04:55.896 --> 04:57.365
but every night
at 1:00a.m. sharp,

04:57.431 --> 04:58.999
I lead you to the bathroom
to make a pishy.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.402
I did not know that.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.003
Well, point is,
I found it

05:03.070 --> 05:04.838
when I moved
your unconscious body,

05:04.905 --> 05:07.575
and this, for sure,
will be our calling card.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.477
I'm sorry. "Our"?

05:09.543 --> 05:11.512
To be clear,
I'm making this movie
on my own.

05:11.579 --> 05:12.580
Of course.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.314
I'll just be there
to watch

05:14.382 --> 05:15.583
and, also, help you.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.051
You only want to help me
for selfish reasons.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.252
Me

05:20.921 --> 05:22.623
Me

05:22.690 --> 05:24.324
Selfish.
You only want to help me

05:24.392 --> 05:25.893
so, if I become
a real director,

05:25.959 --> 05:27.761
you can say
it's all 'cause of you.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.431
Well, that's the truth,
so why wouldn't I say it?

05:30.498 --> 05:34.034
Mom, someday, if I'm ever
in charge of a sound stage,

05:34.101 --> 05:36.937
there is no way you're setting
foot anywhere near it.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.940
You cannot deny
my love and support, Adam.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.609
Mark my words.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.412
One day, I will make
everyone who works for you

05:44.478 --> 05:46.980
very uncomfortable
with my intrusive energy.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.983
And mark my words.
I'm doing this on my own.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.819
In fact,
I'm already in the process

05:51.885 --> 05:53.654
of locking down
my cast and crew.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.155
ADULT ADAM:
Okay, I exaggerated,

05:55.222 --> 05:57.725
but this awesome flyer
was sure to lock 'em down!

05:57.791 --> 05:59.960
And that's
how movies are made.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.962
But while I was looking
for a crew,

06:02.029 --> 06:03.997
Barry was in search
of answers.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.301
And that's how you prove
you're no moron.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.839
ADULT ADAM:
He said, making the most
moronic flyer of all time.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.441
What's with the flyer,
Goldberg?

06:13.507 --> 06:16.009
I made this life-changing bet
with my dad, and I can't lose.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.778
Blood feud
with the old man, huh?

06:17.845 --> 06:20.414
I didn't talk to Coach Senior
for six years

06:20.481 --> 06:22.249
until we finally
arm-wrestled it out.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.684
He won.
But I let him.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.919
No, my thing's
not weird.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.321
I just have to legally change
my name to Moron

06:28.388 --> 06:30.390
if I don't find
the best cheesesteak
in Philly.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.559
But there's a catch.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.861
It's not in Philly.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.496
You know?

06:35.563 --> 06:37.431
Oh, Coach knows.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.634
If you need answers,
follow me.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.636
ADULT ADAM: And with
those mysterious words,

06:42.703 --> 06:45.873
Barry was one step closer
to the Hoagie Grail.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.642
Wait.
The answer's in the gym?

06:48.709 --> 06:51.645
Not in the gym,
Goldberg...

06:51.712 --> 06:52.813
Under it.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.984
ADULT ADAM: So, it
wasn't exactly the catacombs
from Last Crusade,

06:57.050 --> 06:59.052
but this
dusty old storage room

06:59.119 --> 07:01.154
held the answers
Barry needed most.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.690
Cool!

07:02.756 --> 07:05.025
Here. I believe
that's exactly
what you're looking for.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.627
This is the place!

07:06.694 --> 07:09.429
Such a regal name
for a glorious sandwich.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.331
ADULT ADAM:
Donkey's Place,

07:11.398 --> 07:13.366
a confusing name for a
cheesesteakery,
but, still...

07:13.433 --> 07:15.869
The donkey is the most noble
of all work beasts.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.605
Now, go.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.473
Show your father
who the real moron is.

07:21.609 --> 07:24.712
In my hand, I hold a map
on the back of the menu

07:24.778 --> 07:27.681
that leads to the world's
greatest meat sandwich.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.249
We're going tonight.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.685
Don't argue!
Put on your pants and move!

07:31.752 --> 07:33.353
Let's go.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.089
Whoa. You got up so fast.
I didn't know
that was possible.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.625
It's a win-win for me.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.527
You see, either you're right

07:39.593 --> 07:41.729
and I get the greatest
cheesesteak of all time,

07:41.795 --> 07:44.565
or you're wrong and I get
the greatest gift of all,

07:44.632 --> 07:46.099
you're a permanent moron.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.269
Prepare to literally eat
those words.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.404
To Donkey's in Camden!

07:52.740 --> 07:54.174
ADULT ADAM:
Like Indiana Jones himself,

07:54.241 --> 07:57.210
my brother suited up
for the ultimate crusade.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.180
Just one problem,
Barry was behind the wheel.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.050
This is
a living nightmare.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.217
Should I take this exit?

08:04.284 --> 08:05.485
No, don't take this exit.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.887
Blinkers on.
I'm taking it.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.221
I'm not lost.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.658
I'm positive I'm not going
the right way.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.060
I have a good feeling
about this unpaved road.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.762
Oh, I gotta pee.
Hold it.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.196
I got to go.
Hold it.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.497
I got to go, Dad.

08:17.565 --> 08:20.768
Hey, pelicans!
We're near the ocean.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.035
Just drive me in.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.037
BARRY: Uh-oh.
I left my wallet at home.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.973
MURRAY: Of course
you did, moron!

08:26.039 --> 08:27.875
Yo, bro.
We heard about your movie.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.076
JTP wants in.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.544
Seriously?
You want to be in it?

08:30.611 --> 08:32.245
I was thinking
more cameraman.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.548
Naked Rob's tired
of always being
objectified for his body.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.050
Technically, you're the one
who gets naked, but, yes.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.218
Can I be the prop guy?

08:38.285 --> 08:39.386
You know,
everyone's always focused

08:39.452 --> 08:41.121
on the characters
in the movie,

08:41.188 --> 08:42.422
but I'm always, like,
"Where'd they get
that salt shaker?"

08:42.489 --> 08:43.624
And I can be your gaffer.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.125
That way, I can find out
what a gaffer is.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.860
I guess
I could do whatever job

08:46.927 --> 08:50.130
a handsome, charismatic guy
with a camera-friendly smile
would do.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.298
You tell me.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.266
Actually, I'm looking
for my Indiana Jones.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.637
Me? I never would've
thought of that.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.472
Can I help build sets
for your movie?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.742
I have over eight years'
of stage crew experience.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.076
Please, please, please.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.879
Yo, nerd. I hear
you need a snake
for your badass movie.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.148
I own six, so count me in
as animal wrangler.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.683
I'll do costumes

09:09.750 --> 09:12.019
'cause doing clothes
just for me
has gotten old.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.922
Oh, wow.
This is coming together
incredibly fast.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.556
All because
of one little flyer.

09:16.624 --> 09:19.627
What flyer?
No, we read your script.

09:19.693 --> 09:20.994
How'd you get my script?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.897
Just read the first page!
I promise you'll fall in love!

09:23.964 --> 09:25.198
Mom! No!

09:25.265 --> 09:26.834
Leave the nice students
alone!

09:26.900 --> 09:29.002
I thought I was clear!
No Mom on this movie.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.471
No, you said
I couldn't be on set,

09:31.538 --> 09:33.807
which is why I'm here,
acting as your agent.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.008
But don't worry.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.477
I'll take my 10%
in belly kisses. Ah-ah-ah-ah!

09:37.544 --> 09:39.046
No! I don't need an agent.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.915
Food. What about food?
Let Mama do the catering.

09:41.982 --> 09:45.152
You know I can make
a lasagna so dens,
it can feed 62 people.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.788
Fine! You can be
my craft-service lady,

09:47.855 --> 09:49.757
but only 'cause a fed crew
is a happy crew.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.659
But you're not to say
anything to anyone.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.661
Oh, yay!
We're making a movie!

09:53.727 --> 09:55.562
I mean,
you're making a movie.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.030
I'm not making anything.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.300
Except banana bread and
100 phone calls to my friends.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.469
ADULT ADAM: Like always,
my smother couldn't stay away.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.538
But there was
one family member
I happily welcomed on board.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.640
I want in on your movie.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.141
Wha... Seriously?

10:08.208 --> 10:09.943
Geoff said it's a good script,
and that it's not just

10:10.010 --> 10:12.713
your mouth-breathing
loser friends helping.
It's also real people.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.347
I can't believe it!

10:14.414 --> 10:16.049
Composing
for a minor motion picture

10:16.116 --> 10:19.252
is gonna be huge
for my music career.
So, what do you say?

10:19.319 --> 10:20.854
Yes!
I always knew one day

10:20.921 --> 10:22.690
we'd collaborate
on something amazing.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.958
Okay, I don't take notes,
and I'll call you
when I'm done.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.660
And she's gone.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.328
Concerning.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.497
Don't be nervous, love bug.
Not nervous.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.300
This is everything you've
ever hoped and dreamed about.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.269
Now I'm nervous.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.507
ADULT ADAM:
It was the first day
of my big movie.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.676
The sets were built.
The cameras were loaded.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.678
And I couldn't wait to call,
"Action!"

10:44.745 --> 10:47.881
Holy balls!
Dan, this is unreal!

10:47.948 --> 10:49.282
How'd you pull it off
so fast?

10:49.349 --> 10:50.784
I melded together
the old sets

10:50.851 --> 10:53.754
from The King and I,
Oklahoma,
and Damn Yankees.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.288
Also, I have
a lot of spare time
on my hands

10:55.355 --> 10:56.924
'cause I struggle socially.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.992
And you can see it
in your work, pal.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.894
Now, where's my actors?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.903
Oh, wow!
You guys really look

11:09.970 --> 11:11.839
just like
the real characters.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.774
Are those the security tags
from Benetton?

11:13.841 --> 11:15.042
No.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.409
Uh, excuse me.
Trail mix?

11:16.476 --> 11:18.779
Apple slices?
Little cup of tuna?

11:18.846 --> 11:20.180
No thanks, craft service.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.449
Now, please stay
in your designated area.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.185
As you wish,
Director Goldberg.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.386
Did you hear that,
everybody?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.188
This squishy tushy monster

11:28.255 --> 11:30.724
is in charge
of the whole enchilada.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.460
Ignore the kooky food lady,
people!

11:33.526 --> 11:35.395
Now, let's make a picture!

11:35.462 --> 11:37.397
Yeah!
Right on.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.799
ADULT ADAM:
As my adventure began,

11:38.866 --> 11:40.968
my brother's crusade
had come to an end.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.569
There it is!

11:42.635 --> 11:44.571
ADULT ADAM: It was a long,
grueling journey,

11:44.637 --> 11:46.807
but as Barry
gazed upon Donkey's,

11:46.874 --> 11:48.776
shining like
a delicious beacon of hope,

11:48.842 --> 11:50.610
he knew
it would all be worth it.

11:50.677 --> 11:53.246
Nothing could stop him now.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.282
Hey! Open up!

11:55.348 --> 11:57.350
ADULT ADAM:
Unless they got there
too late.

11:57.417 --> 12:01.221
Please, crusty old man!
Just one. One sandwich.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.691
One.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.460
But choose wisely.

12:07.527 --> 12:11.431
ADULT ADAM:
It wasn't an immortal Templar,
but the pressure was still on.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.901
Mmm, oh, yeah.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.368
That's the good stuff
I remember.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.104
I got to admit, not bad.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.538
Unh, it's got
a little heat to it.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.273
Whoa!
Coming on kinda strong.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.541
It's fighting back
pretty hard.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.343
Oh, that's a spicy punch
to the mouth.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.245
Aah!
The biting is relentless!

12:25.312 --> 12:27.347
Aah!
What the hell did
you put on this thing?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.783
Something called
"Donkey Kick Sauce."
Ohh!

12:29.850 --> 12:31.618
It was in
the condiment section,
but sounded special,

12:31.684 --> 12:33.620
so I smeared it all over.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.656
He chose poorly.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.628
What the
is wrong with that guy?
No idea!

12:41.694 --> 12:43.196
Give me the keys!
We're going home.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.899
Oh, no!

12:48.168 --> 12:49.903
It's not like
we lost the keys.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.571
We know
exactly where they are.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.841
ADULT ADAM:
While Barry and my dad
dealt with a spicy mess,

12:53.907 --> 12:55.876
I was feeling cool
in the director's seat.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.277
Or so I thought.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.678
Hey.
I made the boulder

12:58.745 --> 13:00.881
that's gonna roll down these
temple steps right for Indy.

13:00.948 --> 13:04.284
Um, I think that should be,
like, ten times as big.

13:04.351 --> 13:07.454
That makes sense.
Man, you're super good
at directing.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.323
ADULT ADAM:
Turns out, directing is,
like, really hard.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.325
Okay, I'm back,
and I nailed it.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.294
Oh! So, you want,
like, a big one.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.496
Like... Like, not a rock,
but a boulder.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.366
Okay, this one's smaller,
so that's on me.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.534
ADULT ADAM:
And props were the least
of my problems.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.004
Okay, time for the snake.
Where's my wrangler?

13:24.071 --> 13:26.006
Bad news, bro.
No snake.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.041
No snake?
No snake.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.509
Snake got away.
Snake got away?

13:29.576 --> 13:30.844
Snake's gone.
Snake's gone?

13:30.911 --> 13:32.145
No snake.
No snake.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.947
Don't worry,
he's super fast and hungry.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.182
He'll make himself known.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.716
I'll just fix it in post.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.687
ADULT ADAM:
Then came the problems
with the actors.

13:40.753 --> 13:44.591
Whoo! Let's fight a boulder
and karate chop a tank!

13:44.657 --> 13:46.927
Matt, stop chugging
Jolt Colas.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.162
Can't! I could do this
all day, bro!

13:49.229 --> 13:50.497
Yo, Adam,
I think your Indy

13:50.563 --> 13:52.732
clearly has
a major sugar problem.

13:52.799 --> 13:55.802
ADULT ADAM:
Then, of course, there were
the technical difficulties.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.370
No, no, no! Dude!

13:57.437 --> 13:59.339
You can't expose
any of the film
to actual daylight!

13:59.406 --> 14:01.408
So, what's
the least upsetting way

14:01.474 --> 14:03.176
of saying we got to re-shoot
lots and lots of stuff?

14:03.243 --> 14:08.115
It's fine.
I'll just cut down on my shot
list and fix the rest in post.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.617
Thankfully,
my composer would rescue me.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.752
Buckle up, moviemakers.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.421
Guess who just composed

14:14.487 --> 14:16.924
the greatest movie score
of all time.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.892
Erica!
It's my sister, Erica!

14:18.959 --> 14:21.194
Oh, thank God you came home
from college to help me!

14:21.261 --> 14:22.829
ADULT ADAM: But it wasn't
a movie score...

14:22.896 --> 14:24.831
...just a lame pop song
to further her own career.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.934
* Come on, DJ
play that song*

14:27.000 --> 14:28.835
* Let's party
all night long*

14:28.902 --> 14:32.305
* I'm Indiana Jonesin'
for your body*

14:32.372 --> 14:36.409
* I'm Indiana Jonesin'
for your lips*

14:36.476 --> 14:40.413
* You're tearing my heart
right out of my chest*

14:40.480 --> 14:43.316
* And now I'm Indiana Jonesin'
for that whip*

14:44.517 --> 14:46.553
Come on! Do the Indy.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.588
And Indiana Jones whip.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.590
Yes!

14:50.657 --> 14:52.625
It's fine.
I'll fix it in post.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.461
Let's just keep shooting.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.630
All right, let's go!
Everybody out! It's 7:00.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.133
Volleyball team's
got to practice.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.169
Coach, I can't
just lose my location.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.836
How's about
I shoot around you guys,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.272
and then I'll fix it
in post?

15:05.338 --> 15:07.307
Shoot around them?
They just put up a net
in front of the set.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.943
Everyone, stop
asking questions.
Too many things have changed.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.678
My shot list is useless!

15:11.744 --> 15:12.779
Uh, help?

15:12.845 --> 15:14.281
Hey,
you found my snake.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.583
Guys.
He's looking for food.
Just go limp, bro.

15:16.649 --> 15:19.286
It's fine!
I'll fix it in post.
Let's just keep shooting.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.154
Adam, uh, maybe
you should take five.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.656
Sure!
I've got nothing but time!

15:23.723 --> 15:25.325
It's not like
this whole thing depends

15:25.392 --> 15:27.294
on what I decide
every...

15:27.360 --> 15:29.429
Ha! He's melting down!

15:29.496 --> 15:30.863
...single second!

15:30.930 --> 15:31.999
Aah.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.834
Balls!

15:35.668 --> 15:36.803
BEVERLY: Boopie!

15:36.869 --> 15:37.904
Shake it off, Goldberg!

15:37.971 --> 15:41.374
BEVERLY: Oh! Oh!

15:41.441 --> 15:43.310
I'll fix it in post.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.078
ADULT ADAM: While I was
in production hell,

15:45.145 --> 15:47.714
Barry and my dad
were stuck at
the worst place on earth,

15:47.780 --> 15:48.982
a Jersey bus station.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.917
Looks good.
That from Donkey's?

15:50.984 --> 15:52.219
Oh, yeah, worth the trip

15:52.285 --> 15:53.820
for the best cheesesteak
on the planet.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.323
Hear that?
"Best on the planet."

15:56.389 --> 15:57.991
That's proof
that I'm right.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.794
Truth is, Barry,
I'm never calling you
a moron ever again.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.396
Really?
Yeah.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.865
I'm beginning to think,
after today,

16:05.932 --> 16:07.934
that you're
an actual moron.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.803
And if you are
an actual, factual moron,

16:10.870 --> 16:13.106
then to keep calling you one
is just plain mean.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.808
No, I don't want
to not be called
a moron for that reason.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.378
I want to not
be called a moron
'cause I'm not a moron.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.048
How 'bout "Barry"?
You like "Barry"?
Is "Barry" good for you?

16:21.114 --> 16:22.915
That's even worse!

16:22.982 --> 16:24.551
ADULT ADAM:
And then it happened.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.354
Barry saw his opportunity
to prove to our dad,

16:27.420 --> 16:29.489
once and for all,
he wasn't a moron.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.058
That's it.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.926
We're eating a Donkey steak
if it's the last thing I do!

16:33.993 --> 16:36.929
Sit down and do not mess
with that man's sandwich.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.232
We'll just switch it
with our flaming hot one!

16:39.299 --> 16:41.501
He's a giant.
He'll never notice the spicy.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.270
That's not
how spicy works.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.677
Hey!

16:50.743 --> 16:52.045
Oh, crap!

16:53.313 --> 16:55.748
Sir, please
don't chase my son!

16:55.815 --> 16:58.285
He's a moron!
It's not his fault!

17:09.796 --> 17:11.164
BARRY: Ow!

17:11.231 --> 17:13.333
My cheesesteak-eating
arm!

17:15.168 --> 17:17.804
Please don't.
I have to win a bet!

17:19.839 --> 17:21.774
ADULT ADAM:
After my disastrous day
of filming,

17:21.841 --> 17:23.910
I was truly left
a broken man.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.279
Fix it in post.
I'mma fix it in post.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.148
Let... Let me take a look.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.750
ADULT ADAM: And so,
I screened the only
usable footage I had.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.619
That's why
I got into showbiz.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.821
Do you think any of them
noticed me gaffing?

17:34.887 --> 17:36.356
That's a wrap, weirdos!

17:36.423 --> 17:37.790
Out of my gym!
Go! Go! Go!

17:37.857 --> 17:39.659
Come on, scram!
ANDY: Aah!

17:39.726 --> 17:41.428
ADULT ADAM:
It wasn't great.
Question...

17:41.494 --> 17:44.364
Just how much
can you fix in post?

17:44.431 --> 17:45.898
Honestly, I don't care

17:45.965 --> 17:47.934
'cause I, like,
suck at directing stuff.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.971
Don't say that. You are
my little Stevie Spielboopie.

17:52.038 --> 17:55.007
I'm not. I'm gonna be
painfully honest here.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.043
I always said
I wanted to direct,

17:57.110 --> 17:58.478
but I didn't really know
what it meant.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.514
And now I do,
and I hated every second.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.217
But this is all
you've ever talked about.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.454
If not this, what else
are you gonna be?

18:07.520 --> 18:10.157
I guess... Nothing.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.993
And so, I abandoned
my first directing gig

18:14.060 --> 18:15.962
feeling hopeless and broken.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.565
But not nearly as broken
as Barry's
cheesesteak-eating arm.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.699
How's the arm?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.668
Broken.
Like the rest of me.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.304
So, you lost some car keys.
Who cares?

18:24.371 --> 18:26.639
The fact is,
I am a total moron,

18:26.706 --> 18:28.475
and I deserve
to be called one.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.544
Do you know why
I point out your stupidity
20 times a day?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.380
'Cause all I do
is make stupid choices?

18:33.446 --> 18:35.982
For sure.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.117
But you're also
a really smart kid.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.253
And it's a father's job
to help make sure

18:40.320 --> 18:42.655
his kids grow up
to make smart choices.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.657
So, when you call me
a moron,

18:44.724 --> 18:46.693
it's just 'cause
you really want
the best for me?

18:46.759 --> 18:47.894
Something like that.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.562
And under everything,
it just means, "I love you."

18:49.629 --> 18:51.164
Don't push it, moron.

18:51.231 --> 18:56.569
But, uh, yes.
For sure.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.239
ADULT ADAM:
That day, the real treasure
my dad and brother found

18:59.306 --> 19:00.807
wasn't a sandwich at all.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.142
Admit it,
it's the best, right?

19:03.210 --> 19:04.244
You know what?

19:04.311 --> 19:05.712
Leaving those keys behind

19:05.778 --> 19:07.380
may be the smartest thing
you've ever done.

19:07.447 --> 19:11.284
You chose wisely.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.087
What is his deal?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.224
Where you going,
schmoops?

19:17.290 --> 19:19.192
Returning this camera,
'cause I'll never
need it again.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.927
No, I can't
let you do that.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.630
Mom, please don't make this
about you.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.064
I'm not.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.900
Adam, what you do
with your life
is not my story.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.402
I know that now.

19:29.469 --> 19:32.305
But I can't let you quit
your dream of being Spielberg.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.740
You really should.
Come on.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.643
There must have been
some little part of this
that was fun.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.412
I guess
when I was by myself writing.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.581
Well, that's a start.
Just writing?

19:41.648 --> 19:44.417
Adam, you may not be
a big star like Spielberg,

19:44.484 --> 19:47.254
but I know
you'll find your way
to shine just as bright.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.722
ADULT ADAM:
Turns out, when you let
your loved ones see you

19:49.789 --> 19:51.123
for who you really are,

19:51.190 --> 19:53.593
that's where the adventure
truly begins.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.861
Here we go, Dan.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.062
You're an evil billionaire
who hustles pool

19:56.128 --> 19:57.397
for religious artifacts.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.899
Do it with feeling
and purpose.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.769
ADULT ADAM:
Turns out, my real quest
was finding my calling.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.671
It feels good
to just be the writer.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.906
One might say
I made that happen.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.875
No! You did not
make anything happen!

20:08.941 --> 20:10.877
I mean it.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.779
ADULT ADAM: And there was
one person who saw it in me
the whole time.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.814
But thanks, Mama.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.250
Of course, schmoopy.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.286
And action!

20:19.352 --> 20:20.887
Eight ball,
corner pocket.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.822
Ugh!

20:22.889 --> 20:24.657
BOY: You're calling
the eight ball?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.893
Why, that's ludicrous,
Indiana Jones!

20:26.959 --> 20:29.095
DAN: Eight ball,
corner pocket.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.697
Ugh!

20:30.763 --> 20:32.432
Yes!

20:42.241 --> 20:43.876
I watched
all three Indy movies.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.713
And now I really know
what kind of song
you're looking for.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.180
Erica, I'm not directing...

20:48.247 --> 20:50.417
Just give me
another chance!

20:50.483 --> 20:54.287
* I'm Indiana Jonesin'
for that music *

20:54.354 --> 20:58.458
* I'm Indiana Jonesin'
for those skeleton bones *

20:58.525 --> 21:01.694
* I'll throw you the idol
you throw me your whip *

21:03.330 --> 21:06.699
* I'm Indiana Jonesin'
for Indiana Jones *

21:06.766 --> 21:09.001
* Yo, girl, it's Indy
make some room *

21:09.068 --> 21:11.137
* Wanna take you back
to my Temple of Boom *

21:11.203 --> 21:15.207
* Girl's so hot
that I say, "Damn,
you belong in a museum" *

21:15.274 --> 21:16.843
* All around the map
from Paris to Prague *

21:16.909 --> 21:18.878
* No, they named me
after the dog *

21:18.945 --> 21:21.047
* Drop you
like you're a German soldier *

21:21.113 --> 21:22.982
* Run over you
like a big-ass boulder *

21:23.049 --> 21:26.819
* Indiana Jones
you can raid my ark *

21:26.886 --> 21:29.522
* And, also
I'm afraid of snakes *

21:29.589 --> 21:30.890
No.
