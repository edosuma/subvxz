WEBVTT

00:15.216 --> 00:16.984
Previously on
The White Princess...

00:17.085 --> 00:18.952
"For seven years
support has grown in Europe

00:19.053 --> 00:20.221
"for Prince Richard.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.690
"Soon he will be ready
to come against Henry."

00:23.057 --> 00:26.527
The Duchess of Burgundy
has invited me to be
a guest at her court.

00:26.627 --> 00:27.928
I shall send you
in my stead.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.397
Richard was my brother.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.965
And I miss him every day.
But that boy is not him.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.501
My son, Prince Richard,

00:33.734 --> 00:35.736
who is alive and
well in Burgundy...

00:35.836 --> 00:40.308
God makes you sick
as punishment
for your lies.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.610
Proof of treachery
from their own hands.

00:42.843 --> 00:43.977
Sir William Stanley.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.814
I am loyal
to the rightful king!

00:47.047 --> 00:48.282
Richard of York!

00:48.382 --> 00:50.084
The princes.
One of them got away.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.852
You killed them.
I did not!

00:52.052 --> 00:53.020
You ordered it.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.289
I cannot know for certain
if it was carried out.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.426
Henry needs to know
what is done in his name.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.762
Help me, Lord.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.846
Before I die...

02:33.387 --> 02:36.890
You are not a king,
nor fit to be one.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.428
England rots beneath you.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.396
Men weep.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.866
So, kill me.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.571
And you will kill many
others after me.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.541
Men who will line up to say,

02:54.007 --> 02:56.610
"Long live the true, able

02:57.545 --> 02:58.546
"King...

02:59.847 --> 03:00.848
Richard."

03:31.845 --> 03:32.846
Arthur.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.916
You will never wear
the crown if you cannot
watch a traitor die.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.494
If the man who won
the field at Bosworth
for me

03:46.594 --> 03:48.762
could betray me, then...
The rest are loyal.

03:51.965 --> 03:52.933
Are they?

03:54.335 --> 03:56.304
Are you?
Of course I am.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.746
I saw your face.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.781
The day of Harry's
ennobling banquet.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.883
When your mother said
your brother Richard lives.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.454
You couldn't look at me.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.330
As you can't now.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.598
Henry, we...

04:26.033 --> 04:27.000
We...

04:29.570 --> 04:30.971
I wanted to tell you.
Oh, God.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.341
Please.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.008
What my mother said,

04:35.108 --> 04:36.043
there was some truth in it!

04:40.348 --> 04:43.250
We put a servant boy in
the Tower in my brother
Richard's place

04:43.351 --> 04:44.718
and we sent him
off to safety.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.857
When you sent soldiers
to bring me to Westminster
as your wife,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.359
my brother was with us.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.363
We hid him when
your men arrived.

04:55.829 --> 04:59.833
Then you have lied
to me. For years.
No.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.404
We have heard nothing
from him since.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.374
My mother wrote to half
of Europe searching for him.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.109
Anywhere he could have
gone she begged for word,

05:09.377 --> 05:10.511
and nobody knew anything.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.014
He'd vanished.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.751
Then we learned
that the soldiers tore
our house apart.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.854
Slaughtered every boy
they found.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.756
And then we understood
the silence.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.561
That is how I know
the boy in Burgundy
is just another fraud.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.030
My brother is dead.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.402
Dead?

05:35.403 --> 05:36.404
Dead.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.039
Yet you have never
told me this before.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.942
When we first wed,
I was full of malice.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.812
Then my reasons for not
telling you changed.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.047
I convinced myself
I was shielding you.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.450
From what?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.118
Fear.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.656
So the boy is not Richard.

05:56.824 --> 05:57.825
No.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.601
Then who is he?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.439
Because his marriage to
the Scottish girl is underway.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.541
And when the wedding
feast is done,

06:14.442 --> 06:15.676
whoever he may be,

06:16.677 --> 06:17.711
he wants my kingdom.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.197
Not just King James
of Scotland.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.834
There are faces from every
royal house in Europe.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.471
Apart from Spain.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.275
They're busy with their
newfound world and wealth.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.178
They would not
trouble themselves
with our small lives.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.916
Perhaps they're more
inclined to Tudor's side?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.153
What can Tudor offer them?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.057
Amen.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.221
Thank you. Thank you.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.551
You are very beautiful.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.163
I'm very lucky.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.267
It was hard
to leave her.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.203
Her peace as
she lies sleeping.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.240
Her beauty will
look even better on
the throne of England.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.343
And peace
comes after war.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.080
Has King James
of Scotland said
he will support me?

08:34.882 --> 08:36.249
There is no
surety of it.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.955
Your cause is
your own affair

08:43.591 --> 08:45.458
and waging war
on England
may seem to him

08:45.593 --> 08:47.595
too high a cost
in gold and men.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.765
You must rejoin
the celebrations.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.400
Work hard with him,

08:53.934 --> 08:55.302
and the other
heads of state.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.838
But we must have
Scotland or we'll fail
before we start.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.007
Elizabeth sends funds.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.611
Your mother.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.983
And I shall furnish you
with ecus from
my own gold stores.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.752
It is a start.

09:27.635 --> 09:28.736
I miss him too.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.640
I wish that he were here
to share his wisdom with me.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.342
I'm lost without him.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.345
But three months
have passed and...

09:39.012 --> 09:40.948
I cannot bear to...

09:47.354 --> 09:49.289
I cannot lose you
and my uncle.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.759
Please.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.714
She feels Jasper's
death quite keenly.
Mmm.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.783
This has come for you,
Your Grace.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.785
From Burgundy.

10:24.658 --> 10:25.659
Ah.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.361
My men in Burgundy
have unmasked him.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.932
The boy is the son of
a boatman from Tournai

10:32.032 --> 10:33.767
and his name is
Perkin Warbeck.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.804
Writing my letter to
Scotland will be a joy.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.741
Let's see how it pleases
King James to learn that
he has shamed his cousin

10:41.074 --> 10:43.543
by marrying her to
Sir No One from Nowhere.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.979
Scotland will throw him
back to where he came from

10:46.313 --> 10:48.415
and Europe will deny
they ever met with him.

10:51.018 --> 10:51.985
What is it?

10:55.923 --> 10:57.657
My mother writes
to me again.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.359
Bids me visit.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.251
You are good, Maggie,

11:26.053 --> 11:28.789
to come to me when even
my own daughter won't.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.096
We were coming to London
to visit Teddy anyway.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.931
You saw him.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.466
Didn't you?

11:40.267 --> 11:42.035
My son, Prince Richard.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.839
Has he grown very fair?

11:45.939 --> 11:50.778
We saw a pretender,
Your Grace. Nothing more.

11:58.518 --> 12:01.822
I fear that I shall die
before I lay my own eyes
on him.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.626
Or see my Lizzie
again.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.163
Please. Bid her
come to me.

12:20.808 --> 12:21.842
Lizzie.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.988
We have not had a chance
to speak in private since
my trip to Burgundy.

12:35.522 --> 12:36.523
What would
we speak of, Maggie?

12:38.258 --> 12:39.827
Traitors to
my husband's reign?

12:41.428 --> 12:42.695
The nightmares that
my son has had

12:42.830 --> 12:44.364
since he witnessed
the beheading of
a man he loved?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.269
I'm told you've
been to see my
mother once again.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.839
She wants to see
you, Lizzie.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.841
She's unwell.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.444
I suppose she is still
writing to my aunt
in Burgundy?

12:59.847 --> 13:01.849
We have abandoned our
attempts to stop it.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.418
Better that we let her
do it and have
the monks make copies

13:05.518 --> 13:06.887
so we know
what web she weaves.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.490
She did show me a letter
she had just received.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.127
Everyone in Europe has
accepted him.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.396
They all came
to the wedding.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.532
Apart from Spain.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.903
Your aunt writes,
"Isabella is so lofty

13:23.003 --> 13:24.905
"with her newfound wealth

13:25.005 --> 13:26.874
and self-importance..."
Spain did not attend?

13:28.575 --> 13:29.542
You are certain of it?

13:30.878 --> 13:31.879
It was in the letter.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.549
So will you visit
her then? Lizzie?

13:45.025 --> 13:47.394
We must settle
Arthur's betrothal.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.263
To the Princess
Catherine of Aragon.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.101
Alone of all of Europe,
Spain refused to
meet the boy.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.505
Perhaps they have no
interest with their new
vast lands and riches but...

13:59.539 --> 14:00.740
You've always said that
Arthur is too young

14:00.908 --> 14:02.342
and that he will choose
his wife for love.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.277
Well, now I am saying
he is old enough.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.447
She is reputed
to be beautiful.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.781
Mmm.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.550
It would give him
something good
to dwell on

14:10.650 --> 14:12.752
and ally us with
the strongest force
in Europe.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.387
If Europe backed the boy,

14:14.487 --> 14:16.623
they would've
matched him with
a far more powerful wife

14:16.723 --> 14:20.160
than third cousin-to-the-left
of the ruler of the poorest
land in Christendom.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.461
There simply
isn't a threat.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.796
Mm. The Queen is right.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.134
If we can come to terms
with Isabella of Castile, then

14:28.936 --> 14:31.571
none would dare to
wake that sleeping giant,
now, or in the future.

14:31.671 --> 14:32.705
It would be
the best deterrent.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.376
And the dowry
would be significant.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.145
We will not leave it
to a letter.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.413
We will go there in person.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.964
Bless me, Cardinal Morton...

14:58.065 --> 14:59.432
For I have sinned.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.969
You are the most devout

15:03.103 --> 15:05.438
of our savior's subjects.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.440
God...
He hates me.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.544
He has deserted me.

15:17.985 --> 15:18.986
I went to Jasper.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.422
He was dying.

15:24.992 --> 15:25.993
I could not...

15:26.026 --> 15:27.594
You couldn't save him, no.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.630
But you tried to.
I did not try.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.065
But it is God

15:32.299 --> 15:34.767
who calls us mortal men

15:35.002 --> 15:37.270
to Heaven when he chooses.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.007
No act of ours
can change that.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.776
Your sacrifice for him

15:44.311 --> 15:45.312
has been immense.

15:46.813 --> 15:51.151
Losing those we love
can test our faith.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.221
A pilgrimage

15:55.055 --> 15:57.357
will help you
find your way.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.062
Rededicate
yourself to God.

16:04.031 --> 16:07.034
Pay alms
to the abbeys.

16:08.035 --> 16:11.438
Luke chapter 11, verse 41.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.343
"Give as alms
what is within,

16:17.444 --> 16:22.182
"and everything
will be clean to you."

16:58.518 --> 16:59.652
Godspeed, Your Grace.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.156
We're returning
to our home in Wales.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.824
I have an honor
to bestow upon you.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.461
I'll make you Gentleman
of the Privy Chamber to
Arthur, Prince of Wales.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.364
You'll be his tutor
and his guardian
in my absence.

17:11.731 --> 17:12.765
It will be my pleasure.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.769
I can think of no one better
than a loyal Tudor soldier
who reminds me of my uncle.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.971
Well, we will take him home
with us today.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.342
No, you will stay here
with him at the palace,
Lady Pole.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.812
- But... Our son is...
- He will be brought here.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.315
I will send men
to collect him.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.816
Of course, Your Grace.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.185
Will we tend
to Prince Harry as well?

17:33.120 --> 17:34.321
He will be left
in my mother's care.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.890
She is fond of him
and he may pull her
from her grief.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.127
They're going on
a pilgrimage together.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.667
Small mercies anyway.
Harry's a handful.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.537
I know you hate
to be at court but

17:51.138 --> 17:52.805
we'll make more time
for Teddy while we're here.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.309
And before you know it,
we'll be back home again.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.686
First we will go
to Wimborne Minster.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.189
Where I grew up and
where my father is buried.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.623
Was he a king?

18:12.159 --> 18:13.360
He was a sinner.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.297
Sometimes I fear God
is punishing me for it.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.300
Why couldn't I go
to Spain with Father?

18:20.867 --> 18:22.235
Or stay with Arthur?

18:22.669 --> 18:23.770
You are the second son.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.873
While your brother
will be king,

18:28.341 --> 18:29.542
you may be pope.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.180
And answer only
to the Lord, your God.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.850
As we all must, in the end.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.313
Scotland brings you
one step closer
to your kingdom.

19:07.847 --> 19:08.848
But...

19:10.016 --> 19:11.851
As they have yet
to pledge their support,

19:13.220 --> 19:15.488
you will need to bring
your York charm into play.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.572
Make him happy.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.908
But not so happy
he forgets his cause.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.410
It is a shared cause now.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.913
And I will loan to him
whatever strength he needs.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.382
And keep some
for yourself.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.252
And make that
child a boy.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.257
Lady Grandmother,
do not fear for me.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.359
This work is God's work.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.361
And He will decide
the outcome.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.796
I doubt sometimes
that it is even him.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.501
You have had seven years
of calling him your grandson.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.373
But the boy
I knew had different eyes.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.411
I'm sure they were green.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.814
His brother Edward
had the green eyes.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.950
Richard, always blue.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.488
You're afraid of losing him.
As I am. As we all are.

20:56.289 --> 21:00.827
But his destiny is to destroy
that creature Henry Tudor

21:00.927 --> 21:03.062
and bring us back our peace.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.331
Is it?

21:05.432 --> 21:07.667
Or is it just
your vengeance

21:09.336 --> 21:12.004
that would take another
innocent boy's life?

21:45.071 --> 21:50.009
King Henry. Queen Elizabeth.
I am Rodrigo de Puebla.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.045
Welcome to the Alhambra.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.934
Your Graces.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.103
Princess Catalina of Aragon.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.042
*

23:02.549 --> 23:03.550
**

23:10.823 --> 23:11.858
Your Graces.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.928
I present
Queen Isabel de Castilla

23:16.629 --> 23:19.065
and King Fernando de Aragon.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.503
Protectors of
the Catholic Faith.

23:24.704 --> 23:27.974
Our country's beloved
mother and father.

23:31.478 --> 23:32.479
Your Graces.

23:37.784 --> 23:41.120
I present
King Henry VII
of England

23:42.522 --> 23:43.990
and his Queen, Elizabeth.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.061
Thank you for
the wonderful dancing.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.297
We are most charmed
by your daughter.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.567
We are honored to visit
your most beautiful palace.

23:58.505 --> 24:01.708
It has long been my wish
to form an alliance
between our two great nations

24:01.808 --> 24:04.611
with a marriage of our son
and heir, Prince Arthur,

24:05.244 --> 24:06.245
and Princess Catherine.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.797
You saw our daughter,
Catalina.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.735
She's beautiful and rich.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.638
Daughter to
the mightiest land
in Europe.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.221
She says both Arthur
and Catherine are very young.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.692
She wishes for
a papal dispensation.

26:33.392 --> 26:34.661
That will take time.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.537
So she will write to the Pope

26:45.672 --> 26:47.306
and he will grant it,
and we will have our alliance.

26:48.675 --> 26:50.109
If her wishes are met,
then yes.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.421
More masses for his soul.

27:45.231 --> 27:47.333
Why did you give
the priest gold?

27:47.433 --> 27:48.968
What did you buy from him?

27:49.802 --> 27:51.804
In giving, I find grace.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.242
If you dedicate
yourself to God

27:57.143 --> 27:58.978
then everything you do
will be His will.

28:00.312 --> 28:01.848
Though you may
sometimes doubt him

28:02.982 --> 28:06.753
His will is the light
that guides your hand
in everything you do.

28:09.088 --> 28:12.091
Even when the thing you do
is costly to your person.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.295
How many do
we have to visit?

28:18.765 --> 28:21.768
As many as it takes
to hear His voice.

28:32.779 --> 28:33.780
Richard.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.152
You're getting closer.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.026
You're coming home.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.477
What is it?
The boy has crossed the
River Tweed at Coldstream.

29:05.812 --> 29:07.914
King James rides with him,
and his army.
No!

29:08.014 --> 29:10.049
Wake Prince Arthur.
We'll take him to
the royal apartment

29:10.149 --> 29:11.283
in the Tower for his safety.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.991
But Father said
the Scottish wouldn't come.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.493
Have you sent word to him?
He'll be met at the docks
with news.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.330
Teddy?

29:27.834 --> 29:28.868
Teddy?

29:32.839 --> 29:33.840
Teddy?

29:38.410 --> 29:40.479
This is your cousin,
Prince Arthur.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.016
Did you sin too?

29:46.585 --> 29:47.486
Nobody sinned.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.489
What are you doing?

29:58.330 --> 29:59.866
My Lady the King's Mother.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.168
I've come to hasten you
to Beaulieu.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.170
We are going there
on pilgrimage.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.404
You must come quickly.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.740
Cornwall has risen up
and they are marching this way

30:08.841 --> 30:10.442
bound for London, armed
with pikes and staffs.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.478
Cornwall?
They are angry
at the new tax.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.413
Scotland has invaded,

30:14.513 --> 30:16.315
and now Englishmen are taxed
to pay for soldiers to
defend us.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.750
They say the York Pretender
leads the Scottish
into England.

30:18.851 --> 30:21.320
Oh, he cannot.
No, he cannot.
Please,

30:21.420 --> 30:22.421
come quickly.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.569
You were very kind
to bring us here to safety.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.174
Who knows what would've
happened if you hadn't
ridden out to us.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.775
We would never
enter heaven

30:44.176 --> 30:46.478
if we did not save you
and the Prince from harm.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.019
You have no library here.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.056
I will have one built
and stocked for you.

30:57.589 --> 30:58.891
You're very kind,
Your Grace.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.893
We are in your debt.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.165
When they have passed,

31:06.933 --> 31:08.434
we will return to London.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.938
God does not smile
upon my pilgrimage.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.077
How many?

31:18.945 --> 31:20.312
How many does
the boy have with him?

31:20.412 --> 31:22.048
We believe it is 4,000.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.783
All Scottish, or have others
joined his cause now too?

31:24.951 --> 31:28.454
They say the boy has 1,400
mercenaries from Germany
and Flanders.

31:30.957 --> 31:34.360
A tax was levied to raise
the funds to pay our men.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.596
We are mustering.
But the Cornish are up in arms
about the tax,

31:37.696 --> 31:39.831
and men must be dispatched to
quell them too.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.601
Well, they feel the
Scottish borders are a
long way from their door

31:42.701 --> 31:44.971
and they shouldn't have
to pay for a war that isn't
their concern.

31:45.137 --> 31:48.674
The leaders are camped on
Blackheath hoping the men of
Kent will rise with them.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.677
So I cannot muster from
Cornwall, or from Kent.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.280
Anywhere else?

31:55.982 --> 31:59.018
Is Essex with me? Suffolk?
Or is all the south and
southwest lost to me?

32:01.988 --> 32:05.357
Send men to quell the
Cornish and have the rest made
ready to ride north with me.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.127
And Spain, Your Grace?
Is Spain with us?

32:08.227 --> 32:10.997
Mark the names of those
who do not come,
they are against me.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.100
Hire mercenaries
to boost our numbers.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.004
We have no allies.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.142
Where is my son?
Prince Arthur?

32:24.110 --> 32:26.312
He is in the Tower,
Your Grace.
For his safety.

32:27.013 --> 32:30.449
And Prince Harry returns from
his pilgrimage with My Lady
the King's Mother.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.084
They are under guard.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.554
I have never gone
to battle without Jasper.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.524
He's still with you, Henry.

33:15.061 --> 33:17.196
His strength rides with you
onto the battlefield.

33:19.598 --> 33:20.599
And so does mine.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.305
I will return
to you a victor.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.185
I prayed, Henry.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.087
I was obedient to the Lord.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.356
But now the boy has come
against you...
Harry? Come.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.125
Find my son.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.127
Prince Richard.

34:22.828 --> 34:24.530
Give him what he needs

34:28.667 --> 34:30.136
to win.

34:34.140 --> 34:35.407
To fight.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.145
To stay alive.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.413
We've protected
all the sentries.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.270
Come.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.339
This way.

35:28.727 --> 35:29.861
Wait.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.531
Listen.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.407
Where are they?

36:04.330 --> 36:05.331
It is over.

36:06.232 --> 36:07.666
He withdrew.
Henry.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.304
He did not have
the will to fight me.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.139
He could not bring himself

36:14.573 --> 36:17.709
to take up arms against
God's own annointed king.

36:19.245 --> 36:21.247
What, and so he ran?

36:22.248 --> 36:23.482
Well, then he is not a York.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.253
No York man would ever
run from battle.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.256
No one will believe
his claim again.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.809
I never thought that
we would have this.

37:26.845 --> 37:27.946
But we do.

37:32.651 --> 37:33.952
And none shall
take it from us.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.097
What was he thinking?

37:46.565 --> 37:47.866
After all that
I've done for him?

37:49.401 --> 37:50.836
He leaves the battlefield

37:52.338 --> 37:53.872
to greet an infant.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.342
Her time came early.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.344
He was fearful.

38:00.446 --> 38:03.882
King James says
that he has had
his money wasted.

38:04.082 --> 38:06.618
He is threatening to make
his peace with Tudor.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.357
The boy should not
have done this.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.192
He does as he pleases.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.794
He is behaving...

38:16.362 --> 38:17.963
Behaving like a...
A king?

38:31.109 --> 38:32.644
A king who now has a son.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.615
A York heir.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.188
Henry will be murderous.

38:47.626 --> 38:48.760
He didn't run away.

38:51.129 --> 38:53.031
He left to see
his newborn son.

38:53.732 --> 38:54.766
A son?

38:55.901 --> 38:57.035
He has an heir.

38:58.970 --> 38:59.938
No.

39:00.772 --> 39:03.308
And with that, his claim
is strengthened,

39:03.409 --> 39:06.412
false as it is, and others
will declare for him.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.113
Well, he withdrew.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.450
Perhaps he will
not come again.
He'll come.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.722
We don't know where or when,
but he will come.

39:19.425 --> 39:22.027
And I must pray the nobles
will support me

39:22.127 --> 39:24.763
because the new tax
on the peasants will ensure
that they do not.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.500
We need Spain more than ever.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.670
I will pray.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.021
Oh, My Lady!

40:23.522 --> 40:24.656
My Lady!

40:30.028 --> 40:31.463
There are over 50.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.868
All of England's
noble families must
turn out for you.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.739
And I have written
to ensure that they will.

40:46.478 --> 40:47.613
Your mother is dying.

40:51.617 --> 40:52.751
You must go to her.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.891
I regret that
I did not see Jasper.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.528
He asked for me.

41:02.728 --> 41:04.095
And I shall never know
what he would have
said to me.

41:07.833 --> 41:08.934
Go.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.174
The boy has done what
I would in his shoes.

41:16.274 --> 41:19.177
He sailed from
Scotland to Land's End and

41:21.246 --> 41:23.915
8,000 Cornish men have
joined him, out of hate
for me.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.553
My army gathers.
I must go to them.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.288
I waited for you.

42:04.723 --> 42:05.857
I'm here.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.629
What we have lived
through together.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.602
Now Melusina sings for me.

42:16.702 --> 42:17.703
No.

42:18.604 --> 42:19.705
No, she doesn't.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.277
Please, Lizzie.

42:27.646 --> 42:29.180
Be there for your brother.

42:30.148 --> 42:31.717
He is gone, Mother.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.988
You think I have not
been fair to you.

42:39.257 --> 42:40.826
It doesn't matter,
I love you, Mother.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.062
Stay with me.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.265
Help Richard.

42:51.637 --> 42:53.204
Keep him from danger.

43:00.278 --> 43:02.080
Promise me you will.

43:05.751 --> 43:06.985
Richard is gone.

43:09.855 --> 43:11.957
He is coming, Lizzie.

43:14.159 --> 43:15.761
I feel it.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.767
Can you hear her singing?

43:22.367 --> 43:24.235
No.

43:25.704 --> 43:27.338
No!

43:31.777 --> 43:35.180
Mother, please!

44:21.860 --> 44:22.961
Go, Cathy.

44:23.394 --> 44:24.562
It's time.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.597
Take our son
and claim sanctuary.

44:26.732 --> 44:28.867
Promise me you will
win back your kingdom.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.869
I will come for you both
when I have won.

44:44.382 --> 44:46.785
Go. Go.

44:58.129 --> 44:59.264
Hey!

45:15.781 --> 45:16.882
Queen Elizabeth.

45:25.891 --> 45:27.558
What do you mean,
they've deserted me?

45:28.259 --> 45:29.627
So few of them
turned out for you

45:30.061 --> 45:31.797
that the ones
who did feel torn

45:31.830 --> 45:33.899
and say they will not
fight their own kind.

45:34.800 --> 45:35.901
Henry.

45:37.168 --> 45:38.236
Lizzie.

45:41.807 --> 45:42.841
She is gone.

45:44.242 --> 45:45.310
I had to see you.

45:45.811 --> 45:46.978
You rode all
through the night.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.848
The noblemen
whom I wrote to
did not come?

45:51.149 --> 45:53.651
They claim the swelling
sickness. Something else
to blame me for.

45:53.885 --> 45:54.886
What?

45:58.156 --> 46:01.659
Since Spain is not with us
they feel we are alone
in all of Europe,

46:01.827 --> 46:04.930
while the boy has
every kingdom and

46:06.597 --> 46:08.834
my own men
flocking to his side.

46:09.067 --> 46:10.135
No.

46:11.102 --> 46:13.071
No, they are traitors.
They will not do this.

46:24.850 --> 46:27.352
My Lords! My Lords!

46:29.955 --> 46:31.089
Do you know me?

46:31.957 --> 46:33.191
Of course, Your Grace.

46:33.391 --> 46:34.860
You are the Queen of England.

46:34.960 --> 46:37.228
Then listen to your Queen
when I command you!

46:38.897 --> 46:42.367
England is invaded by
a pretender and the Scots!

46:44.302 --> 46:47.906
Since when have Englishmen
feared Gaels and Celts

46:48.006 --> 46:51.076
and run from warfare
with their tails
between their legs?

46:52.010 --> 46:53.678
They say he is the true king,

46:53.879 --> 46:55.313
Richard of York.

46:55.413 --> 46:59.517
If he were Richard, he would
be my brother and I would
tell you so myself!

47:01.953 --> 47:03.922
But he is here
to kill your kin

47:04.022 --> 47:06.491
and rob England
of what was never his!

47:08.293 --> 47:09.760
If you fear God

47:10.461 --> 47:13.264
then you will honor
your true king,
Henry Tudor!

47:19.504 --> 47:22.040
And if you will not
do it for your King

47:24.075 --> 47:25.476
then do it for me!

47:27.913 --> 47:30.048
The daughter of Edward IV

47:32.918 --> 47:35.020
and Queen Elizabeth Woodville,

47:38.023 --> 47:40.926
who has just passed
from this life
into God's hands.

48:20.698 --> 48:22.467
Your men are here
and they support you.

48:33.211 --> 48:35.080
When this battle is over

48:37.082 --> 48:39.050
you will live in peace
with your families

48:39.150 --> 48:41.652
knowing that you have done
your duty to your King,

48:42.287 --> 48:43.388
your God,

48:44.990 --> 48:46.024
and to your Queen.

48:54.032 --> 48:55.133
How can I thank you?

48:56.001 --> 48:57.168
Come back to me.

48:58.069 --> 48:59.104
To us.

49:00.305 --> 49:01.372
You must go.

49:02.640 --> 49:04.142
The guards will take you
back to London.

49:04.475 --> 49:05.476
Henry, I...

49:09.347 --> 49:11.516
Tell me afterwards.

49:46.084 --> 49:49.054
Guards, shields!

49:56.594 --> 49:57.595
Shields!

50:00.365 --> 50:01.399
Shields up!

50:01.499 --> 50:02.533
March!

50:19.784 --> 50:20.785
Where did he run?

50:24.055 --> 50:25.756
Where is the boy?

50:35.800 --> 50:36.767
*

50:47.178 --> 50:48.313
You won, Henry.

50:50.615 --> 50:52.217
He withdrew,
this is good news.

50:52.417 --> 50:53.751
You think this is
the end of it?

50:56.687 --> 50:58.556
That he won't raise
more men and then return?

51:05.763 --> 51:07.132
What?

51:08.766 --> 51:09.834
**

51:10.135 --> 51:11.136
What is it?

51:14.339 --> 51:15.573
He's claimed sanctuary.

51:16.141 --> 51:17.175
The boy?

51:18.876 --> 51:20.711
Where is he?
At Beaulieu Abbey.

51:21.812 --> 51:23.848
So I cannot even send
my men to bring him to me?

51:24.649 --> 51:25.716
Not men.

51:28.853 --> 51:30.155
I can do it.

51:32.257 --> 51:34.259
God's ways are
mysterious indeed.

51:36.261 --> 51:39.430
Now I understand
my pilgrimage.

51:41.166 --> 51:44.169
He confirms that what
I do is God's work and

51:45.203 --> 51:46.504
my calling

51:46.871 --> 51:49.274
is to be the
guardian of his reign.

52:19.770 --> 52:20.871
Abbot.

52:21.706 --> 52:22.940
Please bring out the boy.

52:23.441 --> 52:24.742
We know that he is here.

52:26.877 --> 52:29.480
My Lady
the King's Mother...

52:31.216 --> 52:32.550
We could not refuse
him sanctuary.

52:33.251 --> 52:34.385
You did what

52:35.686 --> 52:37.222
any holy man would do.

52:38.589 --> 52:40.991
But your allegiance
is to God and to the King.

52:41.592 --> 52:43.594
And I am on God's work.

52:45.029 --> 52:47.898
You will find the definition
in the Bible, in your library.

53:23.268 --> 53:24.469
Has he something else to wear?

53:28.406 --> 53:29.774
We could give
him holy robes.

53:33.811 --> 53:35.012
Disrobe.

53:35.546 --> 53:37.382
Exchange your clothes
with him.

53:39.317 --> 53:41.452
Your impudence
offends the Lord.

53:43.521 --> 53:44.955
Take those garments off.

54:05.310 --> 54:07.111
I've won a king,
and that makes three.

54:07.712 --> 54:09.614
Harry, show your cards
or stop cheating.

54:09.814 --> 54:10.981
I wasn't cheating.

54:11.416 --> 54:13.318
My Lady, Your Grace.

54:13.984 --> 54:15.453
A message from
your Lady Mother.

54:17.488 --> 54:18.623
She has the boy.

54:27.898 --> 54:28.866
I win.

54:48.052 --> 54:50.054
*
