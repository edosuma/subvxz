Hey, I get it.
You got cold feet.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.626
You needed to protect
your internship.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.169
That's not quite it.

18:07.169 --> 18:10.339
It's more like ‐‐
I just ‐‐ I had to protect her.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.759
Okay, look, I saw this photo
on Esme's wall with her

18:13.759 --> 18:16.137
and just a bunch of
White designers,

18:16.137 --> 18:18.180
and it dawned on me
how many obstacles

18:18.180 --> 18:21.142
she's had to overcome
to make it in the fashion world.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.185
And then the one
she'll undoubtedly encounter

18:23.185 --> 18:26.397
as a brown woman
in this world, period?

18:26.397 --> 18:28.608
I couldn't be another one
of those obstacles.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.318
Okay?

18:30.318 --> 18:32.612
I‐I just can't bring myself to
call out another woman of color.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.614
So...

18:34.614 --> 18:35.823
I just
want to let it go.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.579
You know that I think
you did the right thing.
Yeah.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.372
And you did it
for even better reasons

18:43.372 --> 18:45.041
than I would have
thought of.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.335
Really, I was just pushing
for self‐preservation,

18:47.335 --> 18:49.378
so congrats.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.173
Hey, if I'm not gonna stand up
for the beautiful,

18:52.173 --> 18:54.967
high‐cheekbone little guys,
who will?

may have dimmed my shine
a little,

19:09.398 --> 19:11.692
it was also a boost
to my confidence

19:11.692 --> 19:16.072
that someone like her took
my design and made it her own.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.200
And honestly,
I was okay with that.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.869
In fact, I felt really good

Good evening.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.732
I'm Aaron Jackson,

19:51.732 --> 19:53.693
and I'd like to thank you all
for taking this class.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.070
Um, looking around,
I can see that this is still

19:56.070 --> 19:59.198
the most eclectic, diverse group
of students Cal U has to offer.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.242
I mean, I can see we still have
our working parents

who spend their nights
doing everything they wish

20:03.285 --> 20:05.329

One love.

She's feisty. Leg off the desk.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.964
We talked about this. Thank you.

I'm not entirely clear on why
you still have time to be here,

but more power to you.
And to all our freshmen, okay?
